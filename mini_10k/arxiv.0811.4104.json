Superconductivity at 26\nK was discovered in fluorine doped rare-earth iron oxypnictide LaOFeAs1,2 . In subsequent experimental studies\ninvolving different rare earth elements a superconducting Tc larger than 50 K was reported3,4,5 . Since then a\nlarge number of experimental and theoretical papers have\nbeen published, making evident the immense interest of\nthe condensed matter community in this subject6 .\nIt has become clear that the iron pnictide superconductors have, besides a number of substantial differences,\nat least one striking similarity with the copper oxides:\nthe superconductivity emerges by doping an antiferromagnetic, non-superconducting parent compound. This\nantiferromagetism is however of a very unusual kind. Instead of the simple staggered '(\u03c0, \u03c0)' antiferromagnetism\nof the undoped cuprates, this 'stripe' or '(\u03c0, 0)' spin order involves rows of parallel spins on the square Fe-ion\nlattice that are mutually staggered7. In fact, before this\norder sets in a structural phase transition occurs where\nthe two in-plane lattice constants become inequivalent.\nThis structural distortion is very small, but it appears\nthat the electron system undergoes a major reorganization at this transition. This is manifested by resistivity\nanomalies, drastic changes in the Hall- and Seebeck coefficients, and so forth8 . Although the magnetic- and\nstructural distortion appear to be coincident in the 122\nfamily7,9 , in the 1111 compounds they are clearly sepa-\n\nrated7 , and there it is obvious that the large scale changes\nin the electron system occur at the structural transition\nwhile barely anything is seen at the magnetic transition.\nGiven that the structural deformation is minute, this\nis an apparent paradox. Assuming that only the spins\nmatter one could envisage that the spin ordering would\nlead to a drastic nesting type reorganization of the Fermi\nsurfaces, causing a strong change in the electronic properties. But why is so little happening at the magnetic\ntransition? One could speculate that the spins are fluctuating in fanciful ways, and that these fluctuations react strongly to the structural change10,11,12 . Such possibilities cannot be excluded on theoretical grounds but\nwhichever way one wants to proceed invoking only spins\nand itinerant carriers: one is facing a problem of principle.\nThis paper is dedicated to the cause that valuable\nlessons can be learned from the experiences with manganites when dealing with the pnictides. A crucial lesson\nlearned over a decade ago, when dealing with the colossal magneto resistance (CMR) physics of the manganites, was the demonstration by Millis, Littlewood, and\nShraiman13 that the coupling between fluctuating spins\nand charge carriers can only cause relatively weak transport anomalies. In the pnictides one finds that the resistivity drops by a couple of milliohm centimeters, that\nthe Hall mobility increases by 2-3 orders of magnitude,\nand most significantly the Seebeck coefficient drops by\nan order of magnitude from a high temperature limit order value of 40 \u03bc V/K in crossing the transition. It is\nvery questionable if spin-carrier coupling of any kind, be\nit itinerant or strongly coupled, can explain such large\n\n\f2\nchanges in the transport properties.\n\nA.\n\nRole of Electron-Electron Interactions\n\nComparing the pnictides with the cuprate superconductors there is now a consensus that in two regards\nthese systems are clearly different: (i) in the pnictide\nsystem no Mott insulator has been identified indicating\nthat they are 'less strongly correlated' than the cuprates\nin the sense of the Hubbard type local interactions; (ii) in\nthe pnictide one has to account for the presence of several\n3d orbitals playing a role in the low energy physics, contrasting with the single 3dx2 \u2212y2 orbital that is relevant\nin the cuprates.\nAs a consequence, the prevailing viewpoint is to regard\nthe pnictides as LDA metals, where the multi-orbital\nnature of the electronic structure gives rise to a multisheeted Fermi surface, while the 'correlation effects' are\njust perturbative corrections, causing moderate mass enhancements and so on.\nAlthough there is evidence that the system eventually\ndiscovers this 'Fermi-liquid fixed point' at sufficiently low\ntemperatures, it is hard to see how this can explain the\nproperties of the metallic state at higher temperatures.\nThe data alluded to in the above indicate pronounced\n'bad metal' behavior, and these bad metal characteristics do not disappear with doping. In fact, one can argue that the term 'bad metal' actually refers to a state\nof ignorance: it implies that the electron system cannot\npossibly be a simple, coherent Fermi-liquid.\n\nB.\n\nSpin-Charge-Orbital Correlations\n\nAnother important lesson from the manganites is that\nthe presence of multiple orbitals can mean much more\nthan just the presence of multiple LDA bands at the\nFermi-energy. Manganite metals have a degree of itineracy in common with the pnictides, but they still exhibit correlated electron physics tied to orbital degeneracy which is far beyond the reach of standard band\nstructure theory.\nThe seminal work by Kugel and Khomskii in the 1970's\nmade clear that in Mott insulators orbital degrees of\nfreedom turn into dynamical spin like entities that are\ncapable of spin-like ordering phenomena under the condition that in the local limit one has a Jahn-Teller (orbital) degeneracy14. The resulting orbital degrees of freedom can have in dynamical regards a 'life of their own'.\nThis manifests itself typically in transitions characterized\nby small changes in the lattice accompanied by drastic\nchanges in the electronic properties.\nIn the manganites there are numerous vivid examples\nof the workings of orbital ordering15,16,17 . Under the\nright circumstances one can find a transition from a high\ntemperature cubic phase to a low temperature tetragonal phase accompanied by a quite moderate change in the\n\nlattice, but with a change in the electron system that is\nas drastic as a 'dimensional transmutation': this system\nchanges from an isotropic 3D metal at high temperature\nto a quasi 2D electron system at low temperatures where\nthe in-plane resistivity is orders of magntitude lower than\nthe c-axis resistivity18,19,20 .\nThe explanation is that one is dealing in the cubic manganite with a Mn3+ ion with an eg Jahn-Teller degeneracy involving 3dx2 \u2212y2 and 3d3z2 \u22121 orbitals. In the low\ntemperature 'A-phase' one finds a 'ferro' orbital order\nwhere cooperatively the x2 -y 2 orbitals are occupied. This\ngreatly facilitates the hopping in the planes while for simple orthogonality reasons coherent transport along the\nc-axis is blocked. Since the d-electrons only contribute\nmodestly to the cohesive energy of the crystal, this large\nscale change in the low energy degrees of freedom of the\nelectronic system reflect only barely in the properties of\nthe lattice. On the other hand, this orbital order is a\nnecessary condition for the spin system to order, and at\na lower temperature one finds a transition to a simple\nstaggered antiferromagnet, in tune with the observation\nthat in the A-phase the effective microscopic electronic\nstructure is quite similar to the ones found in cuprate\nplanes.\nThe ruthenates are another class of materials in which\nthe orbital degrees of freedom play a decisive role, in both\nthe metallic and insulating phases. Bilayer Ca3 Ru2 O7 ,\nfor instance, has attracted considerable interest because\nthe observed CMR-effect is possibly driven by orbital\nscattering processes among the conduction electrons21,22 .\nAnother example is Tl2 Ru2 O7 , in which below 120 K its\n3D metallic state shows a dramatic dimensional reduction\nand freezes into a quasi-1D spin system, accompanied by\na fundamental orbital reorganization23,24 .\nIt is very remarkable that the groundstate of all\niron pnictides is characterized by a very similar spatial\nanisotropy of the magnetic exchange interactions: along\none direction in the plane the Fe-Fe bonds are strong and\nantiferromagnetic, whereas in the orthogonal direction\nthey are very weak and possibly even ferromagnetic25 .\nWith all the others, also this observation is consistent\nwith our hypothesis that the undoped iron pnictides are\ncontrolled by 'spin-charge-orbital' physics, very similar\nin spirit to the ruthenates and manganites.\n\nC.\n\nOrganization of this Paper\n\nIn Sec. II of this paper we derive the spin-orbital\nHamiltonian starting with a three-orbital Hubbard model\nfor the iron square lattice of the iron pnictides. The phase\ndiagrams in the classical limit of this Hamiltonian are\ndiscussed in Sec. III. We analyze the various phase transitions by also considering the corresponding spin-only\nand orbital-only models. Sec. IV deals with the results\non magnetic excitation spectra, which provide a possible explanation for the reduction of magnetic moment, a\ncentral puzzle in the iron superconductors. We conclude\n\n\f3\nby commenting briefly on how the itineracy may go hand\nin hand with the orbital 'tweed' order that we put forward in the present study, and point out that the 'tweed'\norbital ordered state can, in principle, be observed in\nresonant X-ray diffraction experiments.\n\nII.\n\nSPIN-ORBITAL MODEL FOR IRON PLANES\n\nAs stated above, the superconducting iron-pnictides\nare not strongly coupled doped Mott insulators. Staying\nwithin the realm of Hubbard-model language they are\nlikely to be in the intermediate coupling regime where\nthe Hubbard U 's are of order of the bandwidth. To at\nleast develop qualitative insight in the underlying physics\nit is usually a good idea to approach this regime from\nstrong coupling for the simple reason that more is going\non in strong coupling than in the weak coupling band\nstructure limit. As the experience with for instance the\nmanganites and ruthenates shows, this is even more true\nwhen we are dealing with the physics associated with orbital degeneracy. The orbital ordering phenomena that\nwe have already alluded to, take place in itinerant systems but their logic is quite comprehensible starting from\nthe strongly coupled side.\nThus as a first step we will derive the spin-orbital\nmodel of pnictides starting from a localized electron\nframework. A condition for orbital phenomena to occur is then that the crystal fields conspire to stabilize\nan intermediate spin (S = 1) ionic states. These crystal\nfields come in two natural varieties: one associated with\nthe tetrahedral coordination of Fe by the As atoms, and\na tetragonal field associated with the fact that the overall\ncrystal structure consists of layers. When these crystal\nfields would be both very large the Fe 3d6 ions would\nform a low spin singlet state. This is excluded by the\nobservation of magnetism, and moreover band structure\ncalculations indicate that the crystal fields are relatively\nsmall.\nThe other extreme would be the total domination of\nHund's rule couplings and this would result in a high spin\nS = 2 state, which appears to be the outcome of spin polarized LDA and LDA+U calculations26 . However, given\nthat for elementary chemistry reasons one expects that\nthe tetrahedral splitting is much larger than the tetragonal splitting there is the possibility that the Hunds rule\noverwhelms the latter but looses from the former, resulting in an 'intermediate' S = 1 state. Although the issue\nis difficult to decide on microscopic grounds, for orbital\nphysics to be relevant we need an intermediate spin state\nas in the present crystal field scheme this is the only ionic\nd6 state that exhibits a Jahn-Teller groundstate degeneracy (see Fig. 1).\nIn this situation the starting Hubbard model involves\na non-degenerate |xyi and two doubly-degenerate |xzi\nand |yzi orbitals, as will be defined in subsection A. The\ndetails of the derivation of the model are given in subsection B. The derivation does not assume any specific\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) (a) Fe square lattice (black circles)\nand relative positions of the As ions. The latter are located\nin adjacent layers above (filled red squares) and below (empty\nred squares) the Fe plaquettes. (b) Schematic illustration of a\nground-state d6 configuration of the Fe ions corresponding to\nan intermediate S = 1 spin state. (c) Multiplet structure of\nthe d6i d6j \u21cb d7i d5j charge excitations for localized eg electrons.\n\nstructure for the hopping parameters and hence, is completely general. The algebra involved in the derivation\nis tedious but straightforward and a general reader may\nwish to skip subsection B and jump directly to subsection C where we discuss the relevant hopping processes\nfor the Fe-As plane. Incorporating these hopping parameters leads to the model relevant to the iron plane.\n\nA.\n\nHubbard model for pnictide planes for the\nintermediate-spin d6 state\n\nThe iron ions are in a d6 configuration where we assume\nthe low lying eg orbitals to be fully occupied due to a\nlarge crystal-field splitting between the eg and t2g states.\nThe two remaining electrons occupy the three t2g orbitals\n|ai := |xzi, |bi := |yzi, and |ci := |xyi with x and y\npointing along the bonds of the iron square lattice. Due\nto the Hund's coupling JH between the t2g electrons,\nsuch a configuration leads to an S = 1 intermediate spin\nstate of the d6 Fe ions. Further, we incorporate a small\ntetragonal splitting \u2206 between the |xyi state and the\n|xzi, |yzi doublet (see Fig. 1).\nAssuming the eg electrons to be localized, the physical situation is very similar to almost cubic vanadates\nlike YVO3 or LaVO3 where the two d-electrons of the\nV3+ ions occupy nearly degenerate t2g orbitals. Interestingly, in theses systems orbital ordering in the presence\n\n\f4\nof a small crystal-field splitting \u2206 can lead to C-type\nantiferromagnetism27,28,29 characterized by an ordering\nwavevector Q = (\u03c0, \u03c0, 0). The effective Hubbard model\nfor the t2g electrons consists of a kinetic energy part Ht ,\na crystal field splitting Hcf , and of the on-site electronelectron interactions Hint ,\nH = Ht + Hcf + Hint ,\n\n(1)\n\nwith a kinetic energy contribution that is much richer\nthan in the vanadates. For the nearest neighbor bonds\nthe effective hoppings between the Fe t2g orbitals have\ncontributions from both direct d \u2212 d and d \u2212 p \u2212 d processes via As p-orbitals. These As ions are located in\nadjacent layers above or below the Fe ion plaquettes as illustrated in Fig. 1a. Because of this particular geometry,\nthe indirect As mediated hoppings should be of similar\nstrength for nearest and next-nearest neighbor Fe ions.\nAt this point, we do not specify the effective hopping ma(i,j)\ntrix elements t\u03b1,\u03b2 between orbitals \u03b1, \u03b2 = a, b, c along a\nparticular bond (i, j) and write the kinetic energy operator in the most general form,\nHt = \u2212\n\nXX\n\n(i,j)\n\nt\u03b1\u03b2 (d\u2020i\u03b1\u03c3 dj\u03b2\u03c3 + h.c.),\n\n(2)\n\n(i,j) \u03b1\u03b2,\u03c3\n\nwhere d\u2020i\u03b1\u03c3 (di\u03b1\u03c3 ) creates (annihilates) an electron on site\ni in orbital \u03b1 with spin \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193.

This orbital degree of freedom can be viewed as\na T = 21 pseudospin. From Eqs.

The functional form of B only depends on\ntotal spins si and sj on the two sites in the intermediate t12g t32g states. Whereas the single occupied site has\nnecessarily s = 1/2 the other site can be in a high-spin\n(s = 3/2) or low-spin (s = 1/2) state.

The projections of the dxz and dyz orbitals on\nthe Fe-plane are depicted in white and light grey, respectively,\nand the dxy orbitals are shown in dark grey\n\npnictide planes we have to use the corresponding hopping parameters. We use the Slater-Koster integrals31\nalong with the geometry of the Fe-As planes to determine all the hopping parameters involving the three t2g\norbitals on the nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor Fe sites. This considerably reduces the number of\nindependent hopping parameters that enter the Hamiltonian. The direct d \u2212 d hoppings are considered to be\nmuch smaller therefore we use hoppings via the As-p orbitals only which are given in Appendix B and depend\non the direction cosines l, m, n of the As-Fe bond, as well\nas on the ratio \u03b3 = (pd\u03c0)/(pd\u03c3)32,33,34 . These resulting effective hopping matrix elements between the t2g Fe\norbitals are shown schematically in Fig. 2 and can be\nparametrized by the lattice parameter \u03bb = |n/l| and \u03b3.\nIn Fig. 3 the dependence of the hopping matrix elements on the ratio \u03b3 = (pd\u03c0)/(pd\u03c3) is shown for a\nlattice parameter \u03bb = 0.7 which is slightly below the\nvalue resulting from the Fe-Fe spacing and the distance\nof the As ions to the Fe planes. Over a realistic range\n\u22120.2 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 0.2 we find a very strong dependence of the\nhopping amplitudes on \u03b3 and therefore expect the stability of possible phases to depend crucially on \u03b3. This\nparameter cannot be obtained by geometrical considerations but depends for instance on how strongly the orbitals delocalize.\nHaving specified the effective hopping parameters\n\u03b1i := ti /t between the Fe orbitals for nearest and nextnearest neighbors (see Fig. 2) which are parametrized\nentirely by the ratio \u03b3 = (pd\u03c0)/(pd\u03c3) and the lattice parameter \u03bb = |n/l| we can now write down the effective\nKK model for the Fe planes.

We have\nfour parameters that enter the model: \u03bb and \u03b3 determine the relative strength of various hopping parameters\nand \u03b7 and \u03b4 enter via the energy denominators. Zero\ntemperature phase transitions are discussed in subsection A, subsection B is devoted to the understanding of\nfinite temperature transitions and subsection C analyses\nthe phases in terms of the corresponding spin-only and\norbital-only models.\nThe results that we discuss below demonstrate that\nthe Hamiltonian is highly frustrated in the spin and orbital variables. While the spin frustration is largely due\nto the competing interactions between nearest- and nextnearest neighbors, the frustration in orbital sector is more\nintrinsic and exists within a single bond in the Hamiltonian. The spin (\u03c0, 0) state is found to be stable over\na wide range of parameter space due to the strong nnn\nAF coupling. However, depending on the parameters,\nthere are three possible orderings of the orbitals that accompany the spin 'stripe' order. Two out of these three\norbital ordering patterns break the in-plane symmetry of\nthe lattice and hence are likely candidates for explaining the orthorhombic transition observed in the parent\ncompounds.\nA.\n\nZero temperature\n\nSince the effective KK Hamiltonian derived in section\nII contains a large number of competing terms it is almost\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) \u03b7-\u03b3 phase diagram for \u03bb = 0.7 and\n\u03b4 = 0.01. \u03b7 = JH /U , \u03b3 = (pd\u03c0)/(pd\u03c3). The phases are\ndenoted by their ordering wavevectors in the spin and orbital\nvariables. T z or T x refers to the component of the orbital\npseudospin that is saturated in the ordered state.\n\nimpossible to anticipate what kind of spin-orbital orderings are realized for different parameter values, in particular since the signs and relative strengths of the effective\nhoppings \u03b1i between nearest and next-nearest neighbor\nFe orbitals crucially depend on the ratio \u03b3 = (pd\u03c0)/(pd\u03c3)\nas pictured in Fig. 3. While the parameters \u03b11 , \u03b14 and\n\u03b17 do not show large relative changes over the range of\n\u03b3 shown in the figure, there are very clear crossings between \u03b12 and \u03b13 and \u03b15 and \u03b16 .\nRecall that \u03b15 and \u03b16 are the hoppings between nearest\nand next-nearest neighbors involving orbital |ci := |xyi.\nIf we infer the spin order arising purely from the nondegenerate |ci orbital, it suggests that the spin state\nshould be (\u03c0, 0)-ordered for \u03b125 < 2\u03b126 and (\u03c0, \u03c0)-ordered\notherwise. Therefore, this would imply that as \u03b3 \u2192 \u22120.2\nthe magnetic superexchange resulting from the |ci orbitals only favors (\u03c0, \u03c0) antiferromagnetism, whereas the\n(\u03c0, 0) stripe AF becomes favorable for \u03b3 \u2192 0.2.\nA similar spin-only analysis for the degenerate orbitals\n|ai,|bi is not possible and one has to treat the full spinorbital Hamiltonian in order to find the groundstates.\nNevertheless, the complicated variations in the hopping\nparameters already suggest that we can expect a very rich\nand complex phase diagram for the groundstate of the\nspin-orbital Hamiltonian. In particular in the region of\nintermediate \u03b3 where the magnetic superexchange model\nresulting form the |ci orbitals only becomes highly frustrated we expect the magnetic ordering to depend crucially on the orbital degrees of freedom.\nWe first look at the classical groundstates of this\nmodel. We make use of classical Monte-Carlo method\nin order to anneal the spin and orbital variables simul-\n\nFIG. 5:\n(Color online) Schematic pictures of the three\nground-state orbital ordering patterns that accompany the\nspin-stripe phase. (a) Orbital-ferro, (b) orbital-stripe, and\n(c) orbital-antiferro\n\ntaneously, starting with a completely random high temperature configuration. Using this method we identify\nthe various groundstates that exist for a combination\nof model parameters. In order to obtain a groundstate\nphase diagram, we minimize the total energy for a set of\nvariational states which also include all the Monte-Carlo\ngroundstates obtained for different choice of parameters.\nFig. 4 shows the resulting T = 0 phase diagram for\nvarying \u03b7 = JH /U and \u03b3 = (pd\u03c0)/(pd\u03c3). The lattice parameter \u03bb is fixed to 0.7, which is close to the experimental value for the oxypnictides. The crystal-field splitting\nbetween the |ci and the |ai,|bi orbitals is considered to\nbe very small, \u03b4 = \u2206/U = 0.01. As expected, a large\nnumber of phases are present in the phase diagram.\nWith increasing \u03b3 we indeed find a transition from a\n(\u03c0, \u03c0) to a (\u03c0, 0) antiferromagnet as suggested from the\nanalysis of the frustrated magnetic superexchange model\ninvolving only the |ci orbitals. This is not surprising since\nthe corresponding couplings \u03b125 and/or \u03b126 are sufficiently\nstrong and as \u03b3 \u2192 0.2 the biggest hopping element is\nin fact given by \u03b16 between next-nearest neighbor |ci\norbitals (see Fig. 3). Whereas the (\u03c0, 0) stripe magnet for\nlarge \u03b3 is accompanied by an antiferro-orbital ordering\nof the Tz components corresponding to a checkerboard\narrangement of the |ai and |bi orbitals (see Fig. 5c) for\nintermediate, small \u03b3 we find two (\u03c0, 0) magnetic phases\npossessing orbital orderings which are likely to break the\ninplane symmetry of the lattice structure.\nFor small \u03b7 we find a ferro-orbital arrangement of the\nTz components corresponding to the formation of chains\nalong the ferromagnetically coupled spin directions (see\nFig. 5a). The existence of this orbital order crucially depends on the pre-existence of a spin stripe state, which\ngenerates magnetic-field-like terms for the orbital pseudospins. This will be discussed in detail when we try to\n\n\f8\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) \u03b7-\u03b3 phase diagram for \u03bb = 0.8 and\n\u03b4 = 0.01.

This phase diagram illustrates the\npoint that \u03b4 is not a crucial parameter in the Hamiltonian.\n\nunderstand the thermal phase transitions. For larger \u03b7\nthe orbital order changes to an orbital-(\u03c0, 0) 'tweed' pattern with a condensation of the Tx components. This corresponds to the formation of orbital zig-zag chains along\nthe antiferromagnetically coupled spin direction as pictured in Fig. 5b. Interestingly, the stripes in the magnetic\nand orbital sectors have the same orientation, contrary\nto the conventional Goodenough-Kanamori rules. However, since we are dealing with a highly frustrated spinorbital model involving nearest and next-nearest neighbor bonds these naive rules are not expected to hold. The\n'tweed' orbital order is expected to lead to a displacement pattern of the As ions, which can in principle be\nobserved in X-ray differaction experiments. The 'tweed'\norbital pattern should show up as a higher order structural Bragg peak at (\u03c0, 0). The orbital order might also\nbe directly visible resonant X-ray diffraction at the iron\nK-edge, a technique that was pioneered in the manganites35,36,37 , and is nowadays available for all transition\nmetal K-edges, in particular the iron one38 . Polarization analysis and azimuthal angle dependence can distinguish between charge, spin and orbital contributions to\nthe resonant signal35 which gives the possibility in the\niron pnictides to single out the 'tweed' orbital pattern.\n\ngap closes and the KK model is dominated by processes\ninvolving the low-lying 4 A2 high-spin multiplet favoring\na ferromagnetic superexchange.\nLet us further explore how the groundstate phase diagram changes as we vary the lattice parameter \u03bb and\nthe crystal-field splitting \u03b4. Fig. 6 shows the same phase\ndiagram as in Fig. 4 but for a slightly larger separation of\nthe As ions to the Fe-planes, \u03bb = 0.8. The two interesting\nphases with magnetic (\u03c0, 0) and orbital-stripe and orbital\nferro orderings do not appear in this phase diagram indicating that the stability of these phases crucially depends\non the relative strength of nearest and next-nereast hoppings which can be tuned by \u03bb. Presence of a tetracritical\npoint is an interesting feature in this phase diagram.\nFinally, we analyze the dependence on the crystal field\nsplitting \u03b4 = \u2206/U which so far we assumed to be tiny.\nWe do not find any qualitative change of the groundstate\nphase diagram with increasing \u03b4. In particular, there\nare no new phases that appear and therefore the crystalfield splitting does not seem to be a crucial parameter.\nFor example, the phase diagram in the \u03b7-\u03b4/\u03b7-plane for\n\u03bb = 0.7 and \u03b3 = \u22120.05 shown in Fig. 7 indicates that\na change in \u03b4 only leads to a small shift of the phase\nboundaries.\n\nThe orbital stripe order persists to the regime of larger\nnegative \u03b3 where the magnetic order changes to the (\u03c0, \u03c0)\nantiferromagnet. This shows that the orbital 'tweed'\nstate does not have spin-(\u03c0, 0) order as a pre-requisite\nand therefore this orbital order can, in principle, exist\nat temperatures higher than the spin transition temperatures. In the regime of large Hund's coupling, \u03b7 \u2265 0.3 the\nsystem becomes ferromagnetic. This tendency is easy to\nunderstand since in the limit \u03b7 \u2192 1/3 the charge-transfer\n\nB.\n\nFinite temperature\n\nTo obtain the transition temperatures for the various\nphase transitions, we track different order parameters as\na function of temperature during Monte-Carlo annealing\nwhere we measure the temperature in units of the energy\nscale J. For example, the spin structure factor is defined\n\n\f9\n1\n\nas\n\n(a)\n\n\u03b7=0.01\n\n1 X\nhSi * Sj iav eiq*(ri \u2212rj ) ,\nS(q) = 2\nN i,j\n\n(16)\n\nwhere h...iav denotes thermal averaging and N is the total number of lattice sites. The orbital structure factor\nO(q) is defined analogously by replacing the spin variables by the orbital variables in the above expression.\nDepending on the groundstate, different components of\nthese structure factors show a characteristic rise upon\nreducing temperature.\nWe fix \u03b4 = 0.01, \u03bb = 0.7 and \u03b3 = \u22120.05 and track the\ntemperature dependence of the system for varying \u03b7. For\nT = 0 this choice of parameters corresponds to a cut of\nthe phase diagram shown in Fig. 4 through four different\nphases including the two (\u03c0, 0) stripe AFs with orbital\norderings breaking the in-plane lattice symmetry.\nIn Fig. 8 the temperature dependence of the corresponding structure factors is shown for representative\nvalues of the Hund's rule coupling \u03b7. For small values\nof \u03b7 the groundstate corresponds to the orbital-ferro and\nspin-stripe state as shown in the phase diagram in Fig. 4.\nFig. 8a shows the temperature dependence of S(\u03c0, 0) and\nO(0, 0) which are the order parameters for the spin-stripe\nand orbital-ferro state, respectively. While the S(\u03c0, 0)\nleads to a characteristic curve with the steepest rise at\nT \u223c 0.5, the rise in O(0, 0) is qualitatively different. In\nfact there is no transition at any finite T in the orbital\nsector. We can still mark a temperature below which a\nsignificant orbital-ferro ordering is present. The origin of\nthis behavior lies in the presence of a Zeeman-like term\nfor the orbital pseudospin.\nFor \u03b7 = 0.15, the phase diagram of Fig. 4 suggests a\nstate with stripe ordering in both spin and orbital variables. We show the temperature dependence of S(\u03c0, 0)\nand O(\u03c0, 0) in Fig. 8b. In this case both the spin and\norbital variables show a spontaneous ordering, with the\nspins ordering at a much higher temperature. An interesting sequence of transitions is observed upon reducing\ntemperature for \u03b7 = 0.18 (see Fig. 8c). This point lies\nclose to the phase boundary between spin-stripe and spinferro state with the orbital-stripe ordering. The spinstripe order parameter S(\u03c0, 0) shows a strong rise near\nT = 0.4. The orbital stripe order sets in at T \u223c 0.15.\nThe onset of this orbital order kills the spin-stripe order. Instead, we find that the (\u03c0, \u03c0) components of the\nspin structure factor shows a strong rise along with the\n(\u03c0, 0) component of the orbital structure factor. Finally\nfor \u03b7 = 0.24 the orbital stripe ordering is accompanied\nby the spin antiferro ordering, with the orbital ordering\nsetting in at slightly higher temperatures (see Fig. 8d).\nThe results shown in Fig. 8 are summarized in the\nT \u2212 \u03b7 phase diagram shown in Fig. 9. For small \u03b7,\nthe groundstate is spin-stripe and orbital-ferro ordered.\nWhile the spin order occurs at higher temperatures, there\nis no genuine transition to the orbital-ferro state.

The stability of the orbital-ferro\nstate crucially depends on the presence of the spin-stripe\norder. The dotted line joining the black circles in the\nsmall-\u03b7 range is only to indicate the temperature below\nwhich the orbital-ferro order is significant. This typical\ntemperature scale reduces with increasing \u03b7, until the\nsystem finds a different groundstate for the orbital variables. Note that the temperature scales involved are very\nsmall owing to the highly frustrated nature of the orbital\nmodel, nevertheless there is no zero-temperature transition in this purely classical limit.\n\nThe spin-stripe state remains stable with the transition\ntemperature reducing slightly. The transition temperature for the orbital stripe state increases upon further\nincreasing \u03b7. For 0.15 < \u03b7 < 0.2, multiple thermal transitions are found for the magnetic state. The spin-stripe\norder which sets in nicely at T \u223c 0.35 is spoiled by the\nonset of orbital-stripe state, which instead stabilizes the\nspin (\u03c0, \u03c0) state. Beyond \u03b7 = 0.2, The orbital stripe\nstate occurs together with the spin antiferro state, with\nthe spin ordering temperatures slightly lower than those\nfor the orbital ordering.

The vertical dashed line indicates the location in \u03b7\nof the phase transition from spin-stripe to spin-antiferro state\nas seen in Fig. 9\n\nLet us try to understand the phase diagram of Fig. 9\nin terms of these coupling constants. We begin with\nthe small-\u03b7 regime where the groundstate is spin-stripe\nand orbital-ferro. Approaching from the high temperature limit, we should look at the spin (orbital) couplings\nwith disordered orbitals (spins). The strongest constants\nturn out to be Jd , which is slightly larger than Jx and\nJy , all three being antiferromagnetic. This suggests that\nthe system should undergo a transition to a spin-stripe\nstate consistent with the phase diagram. The coupling\nconstants of the orbital model are much weaker in the\nsmall-\u03b7 regime. The largest constant is Kdxx suggesting\nan orbital-stripe order. However, since the spin- stripe\nstate sets in at higher temperatures, in order to determine the orbital order one should look at the coupling\nconstants corresponding to the spin-stripe state.

Note that for the\norbitally disordered case Jx = Jy for all values of \u03b7. The\nvertical dashed line indicates the location in \u03b7 of the various\nphase transition as seen in Fig. 9.\n\nare three main effects (compare the solid and dashed lines\nin the low \u03b7 regime in Fig. 10), (i) x- and y-directions become inequivalent in the sense that the couplings along\nx are suppressed while those along y are enhanced, (ii)\nthe diagonal couplings are reduced strongly, and (iii) a\nsingle-site term is generated which acts as magnetic field\nfor the orbital pseudospins. It is in fact this single site\nterm that controls the ordering of the orbitals at low temperatures. This also explains the qualitatively different\nbehavior of the orbital-ferro order parameter observed\nin Fig. 8a. Within the spin-stripe order, the single-site\nterm becomes weaker with increasing \u03b7 whereas the diagonal term increases. This leads to a transition in the\norbital sector from an orbital-ferro to an orbital-stripe\nphase near \u03b7 = 0.11. The region between 0.14 and 0.2\nin eta is very interesting. Approaching from the high\ntemperature the spins order into the 'stripe' state but\nas soon as the orbitals order into stripe state at lower\ntemperature the diagonal couplings Jd are strongly reduced and become smaller than Jy /2. This destabilizes\nthe spin-stripe state and leads to an spin antiferro ordering. For larger \u03b7 the orbital ordering occurs at higher\ntemperature. There is another transition slightly below\n\u03b7 = 0.3 where spins order into a ferro state. This is simply understood as Jx = \u2212Jy from the coupling constants\nof the Heisenberg model.\n\nMAGNETIC EXCITATION SPECTRA\n\nWe now set out to compute the magnetic excitation\nspectra, treating the orbital pseudospins as classical and\nstatic variables. Fixing the orbital degrees of freedom for\na given set of parameters by the corresponding groundstate configuration we are left with an S = 1 Heisenberg model written in (18). The exchange couplings are\nplotted in Fig. 11. Assuming the presence of local moments, such J1 -J2 models with a sufficiently large nextnearest neighbor exchange have been motivated and used\nto rationalize the (\u03c0, 0) magnetism in the iron pnictides39\nand been used subsequently to calculate the magnetic\nexcitation spectra40,41 , where the incorporation of a relatively strong anisotropy between the nearest-neighbor\ncouplings turned out to be necessary to understand the\nlow energy spin-wave excitations41 .\nIn the presence of orbital ordering such an anisotropy\nof the effective magnetic exchange couplings appears naturally. Both, the orbital ferro and the orbital stripe order\nlead to a seizable anisotropy in the nearest-neighbor couplings Jx , Jy , where the anisotropy is much stronger for\nthe orbital ferro order (see Fig. 11). An even more drastic\neffect is the huge suppression of Jd in the orbital-stripe\nregime.\nOn a classical level, the magnetic transitions are easily\nunderstood in the spin-only model (18) as discussed before. The transition from the stripe-AF to the (\u03c0, \u03c0) AF\nat \u03b7 \u2248 0.14 occurs exactly at the point where Jy = 2Jd\nwhereas the transition from (\u03c0, \u03c0) to ferromagnetic order\nat \u03b7 \u2248 0.3 corresponds to the point Jx = \u2212Jy .\nWe proceed to calculate the magnetic excitation spectra in the Q = (\u03c0, 0) and (\u03c0, \u03c0) phases within a linear\nspin-wave approximation. The classical ground states are\ngiven given by Sr = S(0, 0, \u03c3r ) with \u03c3r = exp(iQr) =\n\u00b11. After performing a simple spin rotation, S x =\nS\u0303rx , Sry = \u03c3r S\u0303ry , and Srz = \u03c3r S\u0303rz , we express the rotated\nspin operators\u221aby Holstein-Primakoff bosons, S\u0303 + =\n\u221a\n2S \u2212 n\u0302b, S\u0303 \u2212 = b\u2020 2S \u2212 n\u0302, and S\u0303 z = S\u2212n\u0302 with n\u0302 = b\u2020 b\nto obtain the spin-wave Hamiltonian\nH=S\n\nZ n\no\nAq (b\u2020q bq + b\u2212q b\u2020\u2212q ) + Bq (b\u2020q b\u2020\u2212q + b\u2212q bq ) ,\nq\n\nwith\nAq =\n\nBq\n\n\u0014\n\n\u2212Jx cos Qx + Jx\n\n1 + cos Qx\ncos qx\n2\n\n\u2212Jd cos Qx cos Qy\n\u0015\nJd\n+ (1 + cos Qx cos Qy ) cos qx cos qy + x \u2194 y\n2\n1 \u2212 cos Qx\n1 \u2212 cos Qy\n= Jx\ncos qx + Jy\ncos qy\n2\n2\n+Jd (1 \u2212 cos Qx cos Qy ) cos qx cos qy ,\n\nyielding the spin-wave dispersion \u03c9q = S\n\nq\nA2q \u2212 Bq2 and\n\n\f12\nand the diagonal exchange are large in the orbital ferro\nstate we find a very big gap at (\u03c0, \u03c0). This gap reduces\ndrastically for bigger \u03b7 where the orbital stripe state becomes favorable. Due to the large reduction of Jd and\nalso of the anisotropy, the gap is considerably smaller\nand continuously goes to zero as we approach the transition to the (\u03c0, \u03c0)-AF at \u03b7 \u2248 0.14 where 2Jd \u2212 Jy = 0.\nThis of course also leads to a p\nstrong anisotropy of the\nspin-wave velocities, vy /vx = (2Jd \u2212 Jy )/(2Jd + Jx ).\nOn approaching the magnetic transition we find a significant softening of modes along the (\u03c0, 0)\u2212(\u03c0, \u03c0) direction\nwhich leads to a considerable reduction of magnetic moments close to the transition.\n\nV.\n\nFIG. 12: (Color online) Spin-wave excitation spectra for different values of \u03b7.

However, the spectral weight is centered close\nto the ordering wave vector and goes strictly to zero\nat the antiferromagnetic wave vector.

A variety of interesting spin and orbital ordered phases exist over a physical regime in parameter\nspace. Due to the peculiarities of the pnictide lattice\nand this particular crystal field state we show that the\nrelevant Kugel-Khomskii model is of a particularly interesting kind.\nThe essence of the 'spin-charge-orbital' physics is dynamical frustration. With so many 'wheels in the equation' it tends to be difficult to find solutions that satisfy\nsimultaneously the desires of the various types of degrees\nof freedom in the problem. This principle underlies the\nquite complex phase diagrams of for instance manganites. But this dynamical frustration is also a generic\nproperty of the spin-orbital models describing the JahnTeller degenerate Mott-insulators. In the 'classic' KugelKhomskii model43 describing eg degenerate S = 1/2 3d9\nsystems of cubic 3d systems, Feiner et al.44,45 discovered\na point in parameter space where on the classical level\nthis frustration becomes perfect. In the present context\nof pnictides this appears as particularly relevant since\nthis opens up the possibility that quantum fluctuations\ncan become quite important.\nWe propose two specific orbital ordered phases that explain the orthorhombic transition observed in the experiments. These are orbital-ferro and orbital-stripe states.\nThe orbital-stripe order is particularly interesting since it\nleads to a spin model that provides possible explanation\nfor the reduction of magnetic moment. It is our main\nfinding that in the idealized pnictide spin-orbital model\nthe conditions appear optimal for the frustration physics\nto take over. We find large areas in parameter space\nwhere frustration is near perfect. The cause turns out\nto be a mix of intrinsic frustration associated with having t2g type orbital degeneracy, and the frustration of a\ngeometrical origin coming from the pnictide lattice with\nits competing \"J1 \u2212 J2\" superexchange pathways. The\nsignificance of this finding is that this generic frustration\nwill render the spin-orbital degrees of freedom to be ex-\n\n\f13\ntremely soft, opening up the possibility that they turn\ninto strongly fluctuating degrees of freedom \u2013 a desired\nproperty when one considers pnictide physics.\nWe argued that the orthorhombic transition in half\nfilled pnicitides and the associated anomalies in transport\nproperties can be related to orbital order. When the parameters are tuned away from the frustration regime the\nmain tendency of the system is to anti-ferro orbital ordering, which is the usual situation for antiferromagnets. An\nimportant result is that in the regime of relevance to the\npnictides where the frustrations dominate we find phases\nthat are at the same time (\u03c0, 0) magnets and forms of orbital order that are compatible with orthorhombic lattice\ndistortions (Fig.'s 4,5). Besides the literal ferro-orbital\nordered state (Fig. 5a), we find also a (\u03c0, 0) or 'tweed'\norbital order (Fig. 5b). This appears to be the more\nnatural possibility in the insulating limit and if the weak\nsuperlattice reflections associated with this state would\nbe observed this could be considered as a strong support\nfor the literalness of the strong coupling limit. Surely, the\neffects of itinerancy are expected to modify the picture\nsubstantially. Propagating fermions are expected to stabilize ferro-orbital orders46,47 , which enhances the spatial\nanisotropy of the spin-spin interactions further25 .\nAmong the observable consequences of this orbital\nphysics is its impact of the spin fluctuations. We conclude the paper with an analysis of the spin waves in\nthe orbital ordered phases, coming to the conclusion that\nalso the spin sector is quite frustrated, indicating that the\nquantum spin fluctuations should be quite strong offering\na rational for a strong reduction of the order parameter.\nThus we have forwarded the hypothesis that the undoped iron pnictides are controlled by a very similar\n'spin-charge-orbital' physics as found in ruthenates and\nmanganites. To develop a more quantitative theoretical\nexpectation is less straightforward and as it is certainly\nbeyond standard LDA and LDA+U approaches will require investigations of correlated electron models such as\nwe have derived here48,49 , taking note of the fact that\nthe pnictides most likely belong to the border line cases\nwhere the Hubbard U is neither small nor large compared\nto the bandwidth50 .\n\nAPPENDIX A: EFFECTIVE INTERACTION\nAMPLITUDES\n\nBy acting with the hopping operator Ht (2) on all\nstates in the ground state sector and calculating the overlap of the resulting states projected on the different intermediate states we find the effective interaction amplitudes.

The hoppings between the |ci := |xyi orbitals enter only as a positive constant in Q(2) leading\nto a conventional antiferromagnetic superexchange contribution. Interestingly, the coupling between the |ci and\n|ai,|bi orbitals results in magnetic field terms for the orbital pseudospins.\n\nAPPENDIX B: HOPPING MATRIX ELEMENTS\n\nFor a given As-Fe bond with direction cosines l, m, n,\nthe p to t2g hoppings are given by31\n\n\u221a\ntx,zx = n[ 3l2 (pd\u03c3) + (1 \u2212 2l2 )(pd\u03c0)]\n\u221a\ntx,yz = lmn[ 3(pd\u03c3) \u2212 2(pd\u03c0)]\n\u221a\ntx,xy = m[ 3l2 (pd\u03c3) + (1 \u2212 2l2 )(pd\u03c0)]\nty,zx = tx,yz = tz,xy\n\u221a\nty,yz = n[ 3m2 (pd\u03c3) + (1 \u2212 2m2 )(pd\u03c0)]\n\u221a\nty,xy = l[ 3m2 (pd\u03c3) + (1 \u2212 2m2 )(pd\u03c0)]\n\u221a\ntz,zx = l[ 3n2 (pd\u03c3) + (1 \u2212 2n2 )(pd\u03c0)]\n\u221a\ntz,yz = m[ 3n2 (pd\u03c3) + (1 \u2212 2n2 )(pd\u03c0)].\n\n(B1)\n\nUsing direction cosines (l, m, n) (l2 +m2 +n2 = 1) with\n|l| = |m| resulting from the orthorhombic symmetry, we\nfind that only the following hopping-matrix elements are\nnon-zero,\n\ntxaa = tybb =: t1 ,\ntxbb = tyaa =: t2\ntdaa = tdbb =: t3\nd+\ntd\u2212\nab = \u2212tab\ntxcc = tycc\ntdcc\ntxac = tybc\n\n=:\n=:\n=:\n=:\n\nt4\nt5\nt6\nt7 .\n\n(B2)\n\nThese hopping matrix elements which are shown\nschematically in Fig. 2 can be parametrized by the lattice\nparameter \u03bb = |n/l| and the ratio \u03b3 = (pd\u03c0)/(pd\u03c3) as\nt1 /t\nt2 /t\nt3 /t\nt4 /t\nt5 /t\nt6 /t\nt7 /t\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n\u22122(B 2 \u2212 A2 \u2212 C 2 )\n\u22122(B 2 \u2212 A2 + C 2 )\n\u2212(B 2 + A2 \u2212 C 2 )\n2AB \u2212 C 2\n2A2\n2(B/\u03bb)2 \u2212 A2\n2(AC + AB/\u03bb \u2212 B 2 /\u03bb),\n\n(B3)\n\nwhere we have introduced the overall energy scale t =\n(pd\u03c3)2 /\u2206pd and defined for abbreviation\n\u221a\n\u03bb( 3 \u2212 2\u03b3)\nA = \u221a\n3\n2 + \u03bb2\n\u221a\n\u03bb( 3 + \u03bb2 \u03b3)\nB = \u221a\n3\n2 + \u03bb2\n\u221a 2\n3\u03bb + (2 \u2212 \u03bb2 )\u03b3\nC =\n.\n\u221a\n3\n2 + \u03bb2\n\n(B4)\n\n\f15\nAPPENDIX C: ORBITAL PART OF THE\nHAMILTONIAN\n\nFor the nearest neighbor bonds along x\u0302 and \u0177 the orbital operators in the spin-orbital Hamiltonian are given\nby\n\n\u03a9\u0302x,y\n\n\u0393\u0302x,y\n\n1\n= (\u03b121 + \u03b122 )(1 + 2\u03b7r1 \u2212 \u03b7r3 )T\u0302iz T\u0302jz\n2\n+\u03b11 \u03b12 (1 + 2\u03b7r1 + \u03b7r3 )T\u0302ix T\u0302jx\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\ng2\n\n(C4)\n\n\u03a9\u0302d\u00b1 = (\u03b123 \u2212 \u03b124 )(1 + 2\u03b7r1 \u2212 \u03b7r3 )T\u0302iz T\u0302jz\n\n+\u03b11 \u03b12 (1 + 2\u03b7r1 \u2212 \u03b7r3 )T\u0302iy T\u0302jy\n1\n\u2213 \u03b127 (7r\u03032 + 3r\u03033 \u2212 2r\u03031 \u2212 3g1 )(T\u0302iz + T\u0302jz )\n12\n1\n+ (\u03b121 + \u03b122 )(1 \u2212 2\u03b7r1 \u2212 \u03b7r3 )\n8\n1\n1\n+ \u03b127 (7r\u03032 + 3r\u03033 \u2212 2r\u03031 + 3g1 ) + \u03b125 g2 (C1)\n12\n2\n1 2\n2\nz z\n= (\u03b11 + \u03b12 )\u03b7(r1 + r3 )T\u0302i T\u0302j\n2\n+\u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b7(r1 \u2212 r3 )T\u0302ix T\u0302jx + \u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b7(r1 + r3 )T\u0302iy T\u0302jy\n1\n\u2212 (\u03b121 + \u03b122 )(2 + \u03b7r1 \u2212 \u03b7r3 )\n8\n1\n1\n\u2212 \u03b127 (r\u03031 + 7r\u03032 + 3r\u03033 + 3g1 ) \u2212 \u03b125 g2 , (C2)\n12\n2\n\nY.
