INTRODUCTION\n\nRecent work has seen unprecedented advances in the preparation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) of dilute\nalkali vapors [1\u20133]. These quantum degenerate systems have paved the way for numerous innovative studies of weakly\ninteracting Bose gases. An important area within this field is the generation and study of quantized vortices on\natomic mesoscopic rings and the potential to study effects due to persistent currents and Josephson effects [4\u201310].\nCentral to such studies is investigation of geometries for generation of a BEC in a toroidal trap [11,12]. Typically\nBEC is created in a magnetic trap that confines atoms in weak-field seeking states and is thus dependent on the\natomic hyperfine states. A toroidal trap can then be formed by piercing a magnetic trap with a blue-detuned laser\nat its center [2]. However, the state dependence of the trapping is a limitation for advanced studies including multicomponent spinor condensates. Further, the magnetic field is primarily dictated by the trapping requirements setting\nlimitations on its spatial form and amplitude. Optical dipole traps can potentially circumvent these problems being\nstate independent [13]. Importantly, the spatial form of the optical trap is dictated by the light beams used. This\nallows one to potentially generate arbitrary shapes of condensate [14]. Experimental work has shown the ability to\ntransfer a condensate from a magnetic trap to an optical dipole trap created from a tightly focused Gaussian light\nbeam [13].\nThe circularly symmetric Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) laser modes have generated substantial interest in recent years.\nThis stems from the identification that they possess an orbital angular momentum of lh\u0304 per photon [15]. This is in\naddition to the spin angular momentum associated with the polarization state of the beam. The azimuthal index l\nrefers to the number of 2\u03c0 phase cycles around the mode circumference. A given mode has p + 1 radial nodes in the\nmode profile where p is the other index used in the LG mode description. One finds that LG beams with radial index\np = 0 are in the form of an annulus [16]. There are several techniques for production of LG modes including the use\nof a cylindrical lens mode converter [17] and holographic methods [18]. The latter technique allows generation of LG\nmodes from the fundamental output of a laser beam. The annulus becomes thinner as one increases the azimuthal\nindex l of the mode [16].\nIn this work we present a technique for generating a toroidal BEC employing a Laguerre-Gaussian light beam.\nSingle-ringed forms of such beams offer for the first time a direct possibility of generating ring-shaped condensates in\nan optical potential. We study the operation of this dipole trap as a function of azimuthal mode index and discuss\nthe loading of condensates into such optical traps from a variety of initial conditions.\nII. BASIC MODEL AND EQUATIONS\nA. Gross-Pitaevskii equation\n\nThe basic model we consider is shown in Fig. 1 and comprises a two-dimensional (2D) BEC whose normalized\nmode profile is frozen by tight confinement along the z-direction, and which is placed at the focus of an off-resonant\nLG laser beam of frequency \u03c9L incident along the z-axis that provides a two-dimensional optical potential [13]. The\ntight confinement may be provided, for example, by an independent sheet potential using a scanned optical dipole\npotential [14]. Then the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) describing the macroscopic wavefunction \u03c8(r\u22a5 , t) for the\nquasi-2D motion can be written as [19,20]\nih\u0304\n\n\u2202\u03c8\nh\u03042 2\n=\u2212\n\u2207 \u03c8 + U (r\u22a5 )\u03c8 + gN |\u03c8|2 \u03c8 ,\n\u2202t\n2M \u22a5\n\n(1)\n\nwhere r\u22a5 is the two-dimensional position vector in the plane perpendicular to z, \u22072\u22a5 the corresponding two-dimensional\nLaplacian, M is the atomic mass, and g is the effective short-range interaction strength. The potential term on the\nright-hand-side\n\u0012\n\u0013\nh\u0304\u03932 I(r\u22a5 )\n(2)\nU (r\u22a5 ) =\n8\u2206\nISat\ndescribes the 2D optical dipole potential with \u2206 = \u03c9L \u2212\u03c9A the laser detuning from the optical transition frequency \u03c9A ,\n\u0393 the natural linewidth of the optical transition, ISat is the resonant saturation intensity, and I(r\u22a5 ) = 21 \u01eb0 cn|E(r\u22a5 , 0)|2 ,\nassuming the BEC is centered at z = 0 and has a thickness less than the Rayleigh range of the focused beam. In\naddition, we assume that the intensity profile of the LG beam is undistorted upon propagation through the 2D BEC,\nwhich is reasonable for a thin BEC. We remark, however, that the LG beam becomes spatially phase-modulated upon\n\n2\n\n\ftransiting the BEC, resulting in a changed far field profile of the beam that could prove a useful diagnostic of the\nBEC density profile.\nFor later purposes we point out the GPE conserves both the wave function norm\nZ\nn(t) = d2 r\u22a5 |\u03c8(r\u22a5 , t)|2 ,\n(3)\nand also the effective single-particle Hamiltonian\n\u0015\n\u0014 2\nZ\ngN 4\nh\u0304\n|\u2207\u03c8|2 + U (r\u22a5 )|\u03c8|2 +\n|\u03c8| .\nH(t) = d2 r\u22a5\n2M\n2\n\n(4)\n\nB. Toroidal optical dipole potential\n\nOur goal in this work is to explore theoretically the use of LG beams for producing toroidal optical dipole traps, the\ndipole potential being proportional to the laser intensity in the limit of large detunings considered here. The intensity\nprofile of an LG beam at its focus (z = 0) in cylindrical coordinates (r\u22a5 = (r, \u03b8)) takes the form\n2p!\nP0\nIp,l (r) =\n2\n(p + |l|)! \u03c0wp,l\n\n2r2\n2\nwp,l\n\n!|l|\n\ne\n\n2\n\u22122r 2 /wp,l\n\n\"\n\n2r2\n2\nwp,l\n\nL|l|\np\n\n!#2\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere P0 is the beam power, l is the azimuthal mode index, the field having a variation exp(il\u03b8), p is the radial mode\n|l|\nindex which is the number of radial intensity maxima, wp,l is the mode spot size, and Lp is a generalized Laguerre\npolynomial. Here we create a single-ringed toroidal trap using a red-detuned laser field (\u2206 < 0), so the atoms are\n|l|\nlight-seeking, using an LG beam with p = 0, in which case L0 = 1, and we hereafter\nq drop the p index and take l > 0.\nThen for each value of l the intensity profile has a single maximum at rl = wl 2l [21]. Thus, in order to produce a\ntoroid of a fixed radius rl = rT , we need to choose the spot size wl for each azimuthal mode such that\nr\n2\nwl = rT\n.\n(6)\nl\nFurthermore, for a given l the peak intensity at the toroid center r = rT may be written as\n\u0012 l+1 \u2212(l\u22121) \u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\nl e\n2P0 ll e\u2212l\n= I1\n\u2248 I1 l,\nIl =\n2\n\u03c0wl\nl!\nl!\n\n(7)\n\nwith \u221a\nI1 = e\u22121 P0 /\u03c0rT2 the peak intensity for l = 1 [21]. Here in\u221athe expression for Il we have used Stirling's formula\nl! \u2248 2\u03c0l * ll /el , and we see that the peak intensity scales as l.\nGathering the above results together, for a fixed laser power P0 we may write the optical dipole potential (eq. (2))\nin the following form which is useful for comparison between different values of l\nUl (r) = Ul\n\n\u0012\n\nr\nrT\n\n\u00132l\n\ne\u2212l(r\n\n2\n\n2\n/rT\n\u22121)\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere\nU1 =\n\nh\u0304\u03932\n8\u2206\n\n\u0012\n\ne\u22121 P0\n\u03c0rT2 ISat\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\nUl = U1\n\n\u0012\n\nll+1 e\u2212(l\u22121)\nl!\n\n\u0013\n\n\u221a\n\u2248 U1 l,\n\n(9)\n\nU1 being the optical dipole potential well depth for l = 1 at the toroid radius rT . Note that Ul is negative for a\nlaser red detuned from resonance. Figure 2 shows the normalized optical dipole potential Ul (r)/|U1 | versus r/rT for\nvarious azimuthal mode indices l, a red-detuned laser, and fixed laser power and toroid radius, i.e. fixed U1 . Here\nwe see that as l increases the toroidal trap becomes deeper and tighter, meaning that higher-order LG beams present\nadvantages for making tight toroidal dipole traps.\n\n3\n\n\fIII. GROUND STATE TOROIDAL SOLUTIONS\n\nIn this section we elucidate the ground state properties of toroidal traps using the harmonic oscillator and ThomasFermi approximations. These approximate solutions amply illustrate the key features of the problem.\nA. Thomas-Fermi solution\n\nSetting \u03c8(r, \u03b8, t) = \u03c6(r) exp(\u2212i\u03bct/h\u0304) for the cylindrically symmetric ground state we obtain\n\u03bc\u03c6 = \u2212\n\nh\u03042 2\n\u2207 \u03c6 + Ul (r)\u03c6 + gN |\u03c6|2 \u03c6,\n2M \u22a5\n\n(10)\n\nwith \u03bc the chemical potential. To obtain insight into the solutions of this equation we consider the harmonic oscillator\napproximation to the toroidal dipole potential (eq.

Thus, using higher-order LG beams provides\nan advantage for making tight bound toroidal rings as commented earlier.\nThe 2D Thomas-Fermi solution above should be applicable under the combined conditions gN >> h\u03042 /2M and\n\u2206rl /rT << 1, which ensure that the mean-field energy is greater than the kinetic energy, and the ring width is less\nthan the toroid radius. The latter condition is also required for the validity of the harmonic oscillator approximation.\nB. Scaling\n\nTo explore the parameter space for the toroidal trap it is useful to introduce appropriately scaled units. For a\ntrap of radius rT we scale all lengths as \u03c1\u22a5 = r\u22a5 /rT , all energies are scaled to h\u0304\u03c9T = h\u03042 /M rT2 , and we introduce a\ndimensionless time \u03c4 = \u03c9T t. In these units the GPE becomes\ni\n\n\u2202\u03c6\n1\n= \u2212 \u22072\u22a5 \u03c6 + ul (\u03c1)\u03c6 + \u03c0\u03b7N |\u03c6|2 \u03c6,\n\u2202\u03c4\n2\n4\n\n(16)\n\n\fwhere \u03c6 = rT \u03c8, ul = Ul /h\u0304\u03c9T , and \u03b7 = M g/\u03c0h\u03042 is a dimensionless measure of the repulsive many-body interactions\n[19,20,24]. We shall use the above scaled GPE in our numerical simulations of loading toroidal optical dipole traps.\nTurning to the Thomas-Fermi solution, in dimensionless units the radial harmonic oscillator frequency and the ring\nwidth become\n\u00131/3\n\u0012\np\n\u2206rl\n\u03b7N\n\u03a9l\n3/4\nl\u22121/2\n(17)\n\u2248 2 |u1 | * l\n\u2248\n\u03c9T\nrT\n4|u1 |\nand the chemical potential is given by\n\n\"\n\u0012\n\u00132/3 #\n\u03b7N\n\u03bc\n1/2\n1 + 2 * sgn(u1 )\n\u2248 u1 l\nh\u0304\u03c9T\n4|u1 |\n\n(18)\n\nwhere Stirling's formula has been used. These solutions depend on the dimensionless well depth u1 for l = 1 which is\ngiven explicitly by\n\u0012 \u22121\n\u0013\nU1\ne M P0\n\u03932\nu1 =\n,\n(19)\n=\nh\u0304\u03c9T\n8h\u0304\u2206\n\u03c0ISat\nand is independent of the toroid radius.\nIn dimensionless form the condition gN >> h\u03042 /2M for applicability of the Thomas-Fermi approximation becomes\n\u03b7N >> 1/(2\u03c0). Combining this with the condition \u2206rl /rT < 1 yields the constraint on the number of particles\n\u221a\n1\n< \u03b7N < 4|u1 | l,\n2\u03c0\n\n(20)\n\nwhich shows that traps using higher azimuthal mode index can hold more atoms, all other parameters being equal.\nC. Parameter values\n\nTo illustrate the basic scales involved in toroidal traps we consider the case of the \u03bbA = 589 nm transition of Na\nusing a laser wavelength of \u03bbL = 985 nm and a toroid radius of rT = 10 \u03bcm, these values being used\n\u221a throughout this\n\u221a\npaper. Then using the parameter values ISat = 63 W/m2 , \u0393 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 9.89 MHz, we obtain ul = u1 l = \u2212253 \u00d7 P0 l,\nwith P0 in milli-Watts. Using h\u0304\u03c9T \u2261 2.1 \u00d7 10\u221210 K, with corresponding\ntime scale 1/\u03c9T = 36 ms, for a given\n\u221a\nazimuthal mode index l this potential depth translates to ul = \u221253 \u00d7 P0 l nK. The corresponding effective oscillator\n1/2\nfrequencies in the toroidal trap are then \u03a9l = 2\u03c0 \u00d70.14P0 l3/4 kHz. Consider therefore the case of P0 = 1mW so that\nu1 = \u2212253. For two-dimensional BECs a characteristic value for the many-body parameter is \u03b7 \u2248 10\u22123 [20,24]. Then\nfor N = 105 and l = 6 we have \u2206r6 = 1.9 \u03bcm, and \u03a96 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 0.54 kHz. This is not a particularly tight ring but tighter\nconfinement can be achieved by increasing the azimuthal mode index. Figure 3 shows the variation of the oscillator\nfrequency \u03a9l /2\u03c0 in kHz (solid line), and \u2206rl in microns (dashed line) both versus l for u1 = \u2212253, \u03b7N = 100, and\ndisplays the advantage of using high azimuthal mode index. We note that it is difficult to produce LG modes with very\nhigh azimuthal index (l > 6) due to decreasing mode purity from holographic generation. However, other techniques\nexist for generating narrow annular beams, e.g. using an axicon [25]. Typically the radial spread of such beams is\nvery small, thus they would allow one to explore the region of tight radial confinement seen for LG beams with l \u2265 20\n(see Fig. 3).\nIV. LOADING A TOROIDAL OPTICAL DIPOLE TRAP\n\nHaving established that LG beams can provide toroidal traps for 2D BECs the issue arises of how to load atoms\ninto the ground state of the trap. It does not seem feasible to condense directly in the toroidal trap as it does not lend\nitself to evaporative cooling and the laser field could lead to heating. The solution is then to load into the toroidal\ntrap from an existing BEC, e.g. a magnetic trap or sheet dipole potential trap [14]. Here we consider loading of a\ntoroidal trap from an initial 2D ring BEC, for example using a magnetic trap with a blue-detuned laser piercing its\ncenter [2], and also from a centrally peaked BEC as is the case for conventional harmonic traps. The calculations\npresented here demonstrate that it is in principle possible to load toroidal traps and we use illustrative examples\nwhich highlight the issues involved.\n5\n\n\fA. Types of initial condition\n\nWe have numerically solved the GPE (16) for a variety of initial conditions with the exact optical dipole potential\nin Eq. (8). We consider the situation that for t < 0 the BEC is in the ground state of a prescribed potential which\nis turned off for t > 0 and the toroidal LG trap is turned on. To model this situation we have considered a variety\nof initial conditions at t = 0 and their subsequent evolution. Rather than dwelling on a specific potential model for\nt < 0 we consider the super-Gaussian initial macroscopic wave functions\n\u03c8(r, 0) = N e\u2212(r\u2212rpeak )\n\nm\n\n/w m\n\n,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere N is a normalization constant, w is the width of the initial wave function, m \u2265 2 is the order of the superGaussian, m = 2 being the usual Gaussian, and rpeak is the displacement of the density peak away from the origin:\nfor rpeak = 0 we have a centrally peaked initial density, rpeak = rT gives an initial ring BEC with its peak at the\ntoroid radius. As m increases the initial condition becomes more top-hat like, representative of the broadening due\nto repulsive many-body effects. For the numerics presented here we set m = 8.\nWe have numerically solved the GPE (16) for a variety of initial conditions with the exact optical dipole potential\nin Eq. (8) subject to the above initial conditions using the split-step beam propagation method [26]. In implementing\nthis scheme we have included absorbing boundary conditions at the edge of the numerical grid, thereby simulating\nlosses due to radially outward going atoms. We tested that the numerical results presented were not sensitive to the\nplacement of the absorber. Thus, in our simulations the norm n(t) in Eq. (3) of the macroscopic wave function is\nnot conserved at unity. However, the norm n(t) \u2264 1 is actually a measure of the fraction of initial atoms that are\ncaptured in the toroidal trap.\nFor most of the simulations presented we chose l = 6 as this is characteristic of the LG beams that can be generated\nreliably experimentally at present [16].\nB. Initial ring BEC\n\nFirst we will discuss the loading of the toroidal optical dipole trap with a BEC that is already ring shaped. Although\nthe BEC has already the desired shape, this transfer from a magnetic-based ring trap to a toroidal trap is still of\nimportance as this trap can confine multi-component condensates in different Zeeman sublevels. For an initial ring\nBEC the ground state of the toroidal trap can be excited by reasonably matching the initial and ground state wave\nfunctions. Figure 4 shows two examples of the computed dynamics for an initial ring BEC formed in Na with\nu1 = \u221225.3 (P0 = 0.1 mW), and \u03b7N = 50. For these parameters and l = 6 the Thomas-Fermi theory of the last\nsection gives a ring width of \u2206r6 = 3.2 \u03bcm. In Fig. 4(a), which shows a gray-scale plot of the 2D atomic density\n|\u03c6(x, 0, t)|2 versus time in ms along the horizontal axis and radius x in microns along the vertical axis, we used l = 6,\nw = 4 \u03bcm, and after a transient the density profile settles down to a steady ring of smaller width than the input.\nThe transient involves expansion of the atoms outward from the ring and also inwards towards the origin, and the\npeak at the origin seen for t \u2248 3.2 ms is due to interference between the inwardly propagating circular atomic waves.\nThe outward propagating atomic waves leads to an effective loss mechanism which allows for the damping of the\ninitial wave function towards the ground state toroidal BEC. The final ring contains n \u2248 90% of the initial atoms.\nFigure 4(b) shows a gray-scale plot of the 2D atomic density for the same parameters as 4(a) except l = 2, for which\n\u2206r2 = 5.6 \u03bcm, so that the input with w = 2.5 \u03bcm is now half the expected ring width. After a considerably larger\ntransient than in Fig. 4(a) the density again settles down but now to a larger ring than the input containing about\nn \u2248 80% of the initial atoms. Notice, however, that for t > 15 ms the atomic density shows a further transient,\nand this is caused by weak atomic waves caught around the origin that start to leak out, as revealed by detailed\nexamination of the data.\nFor these simulations we have used a rather low laser power P0 = 0.1 mW, so that the toroidal trap depth is only\nabout 13 nK for l = 6. We have chosen such a loosely bound toroidal trap as an illustrative example of loading since\ntighter traps (larger |u1 |) are generally easier to excite by suitably matched initial ring BECs as the ground state\nand next excited state have a larger energy separation. Thus the present example shows that there is considerable\nrobustness in loading from initial ring BECs, as expected intuitively. One might expect such shallow traps to be very\nsusceptible to heating and losses induced by noise and background gas collisions. However, the heating due to position\nand intensity noise increase with the fourth and second power of the trap frequency \u03a9l , respectively, and heating due\nto background gas collisions is proportional to the square of the trap depth [27,28]. Therefore our shallow traps (with\nlow trap oscillation frequencies and small trap depth) should be relatively immune to these detrimental effects.\n\n6\n\n\fC. Initial centrally peaked BEC\n\nFigure 5 shows representative 2D atomic density plots from simulations of loading from an initial centrally\n\u221a peaked\n(rpeak = 0) Na BEC with m = 8,u1 = \u2212100 (P0 = 0.40 mW), the corresponding trap depth being 21.2 l nK, and\n\u03b7N = 400. The plots are for different initial BEC widths (a) w = rT = 10 \u03bcm with l = 6, (b) w = 14 \u03bcm with\nl = 6, and (c) w = 14 \u03bcm, with l = 2. Case (a) shows very little signs of trapping in the toroid which is centered\nat rT = 10 \u03bcm, but (b) with an increased BEC width of w = 14 \u03bcm now shows substantial trapping with N = 90%\nof the initial atoms trapped. What distinguishes these two case is that the initial Hamiltonian in Eq. (4), which we\nevaluated numerically, is H(0)/h\u0304\u03c9T = 148 in case (a) and H(0)/h\u0304\u03c9T = \u221216.6 for case (b). The Hamiltonian has\nthree contributions, the kinetic energy which is positive, the optical dipole potential which for a red-detuned laser is\nnegative, and the nonlinear term due to many-body repulsion which is positive. As we simulate the effects of atom\nlosses due to outward propagating atoms using the absorbing boundary, the atom number decreases and so typically\ndoes the Hamiltonian as the initial BEC evolves. Physically, as we consider red-detuned traps that have negative\noptical dipole potentials which go to zero away from the trap, atoms with energies above the trap energy of zero will\ntend to be lost from the toroidal trap. For case (a) the initial Hamiltonian or energy is above the trap energy and the\natoms fly above the toroidal trap under the influence of the repulsive many-body effects. Indeed the initial density\nprofile with w = 10 \u03bcm overlaps the toroidal trap very little, leaving only positive contributions to the Hamiltonian\nin Eq. (4). In contrast, for the wider initial BEC in Fig. 5(b) the initial density profile overlaps the toroidal trap\ngiving a net Hamiltonian less than the trap energy, so trapping becomes possible. We remark that the requirement\nthat the initial Hamiltonian be less than the trap energy is a necessary but not sufficient condition for trapping, as\nthere is still dependence on the initial density profile. For example, Fig. 5(c) is the same as in 5(b) except u1 = \u2212253\n(P0 = 1 mW), the corresponding trap depth being 130 nK for l = 6. In this case H(0)/h\u0304\u03c9T = \u2212216, well below the\ntrap energy, but Fig. 5(c) shows that the atoms do not cleanly load into the ground state of the toroidal trap, but\nrather the density displays undamped oscillations on the time scale of the simulation. This oscillatory behavior is\ntypically a feature for deeper traps. We have begun to explore methods of smoothing the loading of deeper toroidal\ntraps, such as tapering the turn-on of the optical potential and phase-imprinting the initial BEC so that it moves\ntowards a ring. These methods do smooth the loading process and we shall report on these issues along with the\neffects of beam misalignments in a future publication.\n\nV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have shown that Laguerre-Gaussian beams provide a flexible means for forming toroidal optical\ndipole traps in 2D atomic BECs, and that the toroidal traps can be loaded from initial conditions representative\nof conventional magnetic traps. It remains to be seen how tight the atoms can be confined in these rings, and\ndetailed numerical studies are underway. This work is a first step towards developing toroidal traps which shall act\nas mesoscopic rings for atoms for a variety of basic and applied studies [4\u201310]. For example, once a BEC is prepared\nin its ground state of the toroidal trap a vortex state of variable angular momentum can be excited using Raman\ncoupling (involving a second LG beam) to another Zeeman sublevel [29], hence allowing for studies of ring vortices and\npersistent currents on a torus [4,5,9]. Also, as our toroidal trap does not involve a magnetic trap it allows for studies\nof multi-component BECs trapped on a ring [10]. In the limit of small number of atoms there is also the possibility\nof realizing a Tonk's gas of impenetrable bosons on a ring [30\u201332], which has been predicted to exhibit dark solitons\n[33]. Furthermore, by looking at higher-order LG modes with different radial index p, and hence multiple concentric\nrings, we can create coaxial toroidal traps for the BECs, hence allowing for radial tunneling between condensates.\nIn particular, multiple rings could create a circular grating for atoms which could in principle act as the feedback\nmechanism for a 2D atom laser, by analogy to circular grating optical lasers [34]. On the applied side, once a ring BEC\nis formed we can further pierce it with blue-detuned lasers at positions along its perimeter to form tunnel-junctions\nakin to superconducting links. One can then envision a range of sensors, e.g. rotation, based on the sensitivity of the\ntunneling current to any perturbation of the system. In principle, large rings could be made by first loading a small\nring and then adiabatically expanding the LG light mode incident on the BEC, hence very sensitive matter-wave\nsensors of inertial forces could result.\nEMW was supported in part by the Office of Naval Research Contract No. N00014-99-1-0806, and the Department of\nArmy Grant No. DAAD 19-00-1-0169.
