A hallmark of quantum mechanics is\nthat quantum information cannot be cloned [5, 6, 7]. The\nenormous impact of this theorem, which was called the\n'no-broadcasting' theorem, is reflected by several studies that focus on various aspects of the nonclonability of\nquantum information [8, 9, 10, 11, 12].\nAlthough it is widely accepted that no-broadcasting is\na fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, an impossibility theorem for the broadcasting of general arbitrary (i.e., finite- as well as infinite-dimensional) density\nmatrices has not yet been formulated. In the literature\ntwo separate proofs for no-broadcasting are to be found,\none applies only to pure states (the no-cloning theorem)\n[5] while the other applies only to invertible density matrices [6]. These two classes of states exclude each other,\nand hence, trivially, none of the two proofs is derivable\nfrom one another. (Although for the finite-dimensional\ncase, a generalization for non-invertible density matrices\nexists [7].)\nIn this paper we present a general proof for the 'nobroadcasting' theorem which applies to arbitrary density matrices. Our proof relies on fundamental principles\nfrom information theory, mainly on entropic considerations. As such, it also enables us to directly link the\ntheorem to its classical analogue which applies to probabilistic distributions of statistical ensembles [13].\nA general broadcasting machine consists of a source\nsystem whose unknown state, \u03c3, is to be broadcast, a target system onto which the source state should be copied,\nand an auxiliary system, or a 'machine', which interacts\nunitarily with the source and target systems. Labeling\nthe three subsystems by subscripts s, t, and m respectively, the broadcasting process then reads:\n\u03c1in = \u03c3s \u2297 \u03c4t \u2297 \u03a3m \u2192 \u03c1out\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the final state \u03c1out obeys\nT rt,m [\u03c1out ] = T rs,m [\u03c1out ] = \u03c3 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere T rt(s),m denote partial traces over the target\n(source) and auxiliary systems. In what follows we show\nthat no unitary (quantum mechanical) transformation\nwhich performs process (1) exists for arbitrary source\nstates.\nOur proof is based on the concept of relative entropy.\nThe relative entropy of a state \u03c11 with respect to another\n\u03c12 [14],\nS(\u03c11 |\u03c12 ) = T r[\u03c11 (log \u03c11 \u2212 log \u03c12 )]\n\n(3)\n\nis a measure of the \"closeness\" between the two. For some\npairs of states (\"perfectly distinguishable\" ones) the relative entropy is ill-defined. This happens if (and only if)\nker(\u03c12 ) \u2286 ker(\u03c11 ), yielding S(\u03c11 |\u03c12 ) = \u221e [15]. For what\nfollows we consider only the case S(\u03c11 |\u03c12 ) < \u221e, and address in detail the problematic issues which may arise\nfrom this ill-definiteness, later on.\nOne important property of relative entropy is that it\nis invariant under dynamical changes. The evolution of a\ngeneral quantum system represented by a density operator \u03c1 is given by \u03c1(t) = U (t)\u03c1(0)U \u2020 (t) where U (t) may\nbe any unitary operator. Since the relative entropy is\ndefined by a trace operation, it is easy to check that it is\nconserved under time evolution, namely:\nS(\u03c11 (t)|\u03c12 (t)) = S(\u03c11 (0)|\u03c12 (0)) .\n\n(4)\n\nLet us now consider two general broadcasting\nprocesses (1), whose initial states are given by\n\u03c1in\ni = \u03c3i,s \u2297 \u03c4t \u2297 \u03a3m , where i = 1, 2, \u03c3i are arbitrary density matrices, and the initial states of the\ntarget and auxiliary systems, \u03c4 and \u03a3, are the same for\nboth processes. The relative entropy of the two states is\n\n\f2\n\nin\nS \u03c1in\n1 |\u03c12\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0014\n= T r \u03c31,s \u2297 \u03c4t \u2297 \u03a3m log \u03c31,s \u2295 log \u03c4t \u2295 log \u03a3m \u2212 log \u03c32,s \u2295 log \u03c4t \u2295 log \u03a3m\n\n(5)\n\n= T rs [\u03c31,s (log \u03c31,s \u2212 log \u03c32,s )] T rm,t [\u03c4t \u2297 \u03a3m ] = T rs [\u03c31,s (log \u03c31,s \u2212 log \u03c32,s )] = S(\u03c31 |\u03c32 ) .\n\nThat is, the relative entropy of the two initial states is\nexclusively given by the relative entropy of the two source\nsystems. Using this and the conservation of relative entropy in time (4), it is clear that\n\nthat all its input states are mutually commuting and the\nbasis in which they are diagonal is known [18]. For any\ntwo non-commuting arbitrary states the inequalities in\n(9) are strict, that is,\n\nin\nout out\nS(\u03c31 |\u03c32 ) = S(\u03c1in\n1 |\u03c12 ) = S(\u03c11 |\u03c12 ) .\n\nout\nS(\u03c1out\n1 |\u03c12 ) > S(\u03c31 |\u03c32 ) ,\n\n(6)\n\nThe relative entropy of the final states of any two broadcasting processes is equal to the relative entropy of the\nsources prior to copying.\nWe now proceed to show that Eq. (6) is violated for\nbroadcasting processes. To do this, we invoke the theorem of monotonicity of relative entropy [16] which reads:\nS(\u03c11,AB |\u03c12,AB ) \u2265 S(\u03c11,B |\u03c12,B ) ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03c11,AB and \u03c12,AB are two density operators of a\ncomposite system AB, whereas \u03c11,B and \u03c12,B denote the\ncorresponding density operators of a subsystem B. The\nequality holds if and only if the condition\nlog \u03c11,AB \u2212 log \u03c12,AB = IA \u2297 (log \u03c11,B \u2212 log \u03c12,B ) , (8)\nevaluated after a restriction to the support of \u03c12,AB , is\nsatisfied, and IA denotes the identity operator of subsystem A [17]. Intuitively, Eq. (8) means that ignoring part\nof two physical systems reduces the 'distance' between\nthem, unless the ignored part contains no information at\nall. Using (7), we can establish a lower bound for the\nrelative entropy of the two final states \u03c1out\ni . The monotonicity inequality (7) implies that the final states fulfill\nout\nout out\nS(\u03c1out\n1 |\u03c12 ) \u2265 S(\u03c11,k |\u03c12,k ) ,\n\n(9)\n\nout\nfor k = s, t where \u03c1out\ni,s(t) denotes T rt(s),m [\u03c1i ]. According\nto Eq. (8), the equality in (9) holds if and only if the\nequalities\nout\nout\nlog \u03c1out\n= (log \u03c1out\n1 \u2212 log \u03c12\n1,s \u2212 log \u03c12,s ) \u2297 It \u2297 Im\nout\n= Is \u2297 (log \u03c1out\n1,t \u2212 log \u03c12,t ) \u2297 Im ,\n\n(10)\n\nevaluated on the support of \u03c1out\n2 , are satisfied. Under\nbroadcasting, Eq. (10) thus reads\nout\nlog \u03c1out\n= (log \u03c31,s \u2212 log \u03c32,s ) \u2297 It \u2297 Im\n1 \u2212 log \u03c12\n= Is \u2297 (log \u03c31,t \u2212 log \u03c32,t ) \u2297 Im .\n(11)\n\nThe above condition, however, is satisfied only if \u03c31 and\n\u03c32 are diagonal, reflecting the fact that a realization of\na broadcasting machine may be possible only provided\n\n(12)\n\nin contradiction with equality (6). We have therefore\nshown that under broadcasting, the monotonicity of relative entropy is in conflict with quantum dynamics, rendering universal broadcasting impossible.\nTo complete our proof, let us consider the case of\nS(\u03c11 |\u03c12 ) = \u221e, and show that the no-broadcasting theorem may be extended to this case as well [19]. This is\ndone using a proof by contradiction. Let us first assume\nthe existence of a machine capable of broadcasting states\nwith infinite relative entropy, and consider two such noncommuting states \u03c31 and \u03c32 for which S(\u03c31 |\u03c32 ) = \u221e.\nDue to the linearity of the broadcasting procedure (containing only unitary operations and partial traces), it\nimmediately follows that the machine is also capable of\nbroadcasting the mixture \u03c3mix = \u03bb\u03c31 + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03c32 for\nany 0 < \u03bb < 1. However, our main proof rules out the\nexistence of a machine which broadcasts both \u03c31 and\n\u03c3mix , since S(\u03c31 |\u03c3mix ) < \u221e [20]. Therefore, the existence of a machine which broadcasts both \u03c31 and \u03c32 is\nalso ruled out, contradictory to our initial assumption,\nand this completes the proof.\nAt this point, we turn to show that the proof given\nabove enables a direct link between the quantum theorem and its classical analogue [13]. The classical nobroadcasting theorem states that it is impossible to\nbroadcast classical probability distributions with unit fidelity in a deterministic manner once infinitely-narrow\ndistributions (i.e., delta-function distributions) are excluded; assuming Liouville evolution for the broadcasting process, the monotonicity of the classical relative\nentropy (the Kullback-Leibler information distance) between two classical probability distributions P1 (x, p, t)\nand P2 (x, p, t), defined by [21]\nZ\nK(P1 , P2 ) = dxdpP1 (log P1 \u2212 log P2 ) ,\n(13)\nis in conflict with broadcasting. (We note here however,\nthat approximate classical broadcasting machines may in\nprinciple be realized with any desired degree of accuracy\n[22].)\nAs we shall now show, the quantum no-broadcasting\ntheorem translates in the ~ \u2192 0 limit to its classical\n\n\f3\nanalogue if Hamiltonian dynamics, which is a subclass\nof Liouville dynamics, is concerned. This will be accomplished in two steps. First, we show that for every classical probability distribution one can construct a\ncorresponding density matrix such that in the classical\nlimit, quantum relative entropy reduces to classical relative entropy. Secondly, we show that quantum (unitary)\ndynamics reduces in the classical limit to Hamiltonian\ndynamics under this correspondence. Even though these\ntwo statements seem reasonable, even expected, to the\nbest of our knowledge they have not yet been shown explicitly.\nAs a preliminary step, we make a classical-quantum\ncorrespondence by assigning to each classical probability\ndistribution over phase space P (x, p) (we drop the time\nindex t), a quantum state according to\n\u03c1=\n\nZ\n\ndxdpP (x, p)|\u03b1ih\u03b1| ,\n\n(14)\n\n1\n(\u03c9x + ip) (we\nwhere |\u03b1i is a coherent state with \u03b1 = \u221a2~\u03c9\nshall fix \u03c9 = 1 in the following).\nThis correspondence is of course the identification of classical probability distributions with the P representations [23] of density matrices. Although the P representation is known to be problematic, being highlysingular, negative or even undefined, we stress here that\nthese types of states are not of our concern here, since in\nour correspondence, the P -distributions we consider are\nbona-fide classical distributions.\nFirst, we show that in the classical limit, the relative\nentropy of two density matrices constructed from two\nclassical statistical distributions by (14) reduces to the\nrelative entropy of the two distributions, namely:\n\nlim S(\u03c11 |\u03c12 ) = K(P1 |P2 ).\n\n~\u21920\n\n(15)\n\nExpanding the logarithms appearing in the expression for\nthe quantum relative entropy in a Taylor series and then\ntracing term by term, it becomes sufficient to show that\nZ\nlim T r[\u03c11 (\u03c12 /~)n\u22121 ] = dxdp P1 (x, p) P2n\u22121 (x, p) ,(16)\n~\u21920\n\nwhere n \u2208 Z+ , and the extra ~ factors appearing in\n(16), are introduced into the relative entropy by rewriting (log \u03c11 \u2212 log \u03c12 ) as (log(\u03c11 /~) \u2212 log(\u03c12 /~)). Inserting\n(14) into the left-hand-side of Eq. (16), we have:\nn\u22121\n\nlim T r[\u03c11 (\u03c12 /~)\n\n~\u21920\n\n\u00d7\n\nZ\n\u2020\n\n]=\n\nZ\n\ndx0 dp0 P1 (x0 , p0 )\n(17)\n!\nn\u22121\nY\nexp[\u2212(2~)\u22121 u\u2020 V u]\n.\ndxi dpi P2 (xi , pi ) lim\n~\u21920\n(2\u03c0~)n\u22121\ni=1\n\nwhere u = (x0 , p0 , x1 , p1 , * * * , xn\u22121 , pn\u22121 ) and V , pre-\n\nsented in a (2 \u00d7 2) \u2297 (n \u00d7 n)\n\uf8eb\n1\nB 0\n\uf8ec BT 1\nB\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec0\nBT 1\nV(2n\u00d72n) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec.\n..\n\uf8ec ..\n.\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed0\n*** 0\nB 0\n***\n\nblock form is:\n\uf8f6\n*** 0\nBT\n0\n*** 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n.. \uf8f7\nB 0\n. \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n, (18)\n\uf8f7\n.. ..\n.\n. 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nBT 1\nB \uf8f8\n0\nBT 1\n(n\u00d7n)\n\n1 and 0 being the (2 \u00d7 2) unit and zero matrices respectively, and B T is the transpose of B = \u2212 21 (1 \u2212 \u03c3y ). In\norder to evaluate the limit, we note that V is a normal matrix and as such it can be written in the form\nV = U DU \u2020 where D is its diagonal form and U is unitary with orthonormal eigenvector basis as its columns.\nComputation of these eigenvectors yields:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1\n\uf8f7\n\u0012\n\u0013 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec \u03c9j2 \uf8f7\n1\n(\u22121)k\n\uf8ec \u03c9j \uf8f7\n\u2297\uf8ec\nekj = \u221a\n(19)\n\uf8f7 ,\ni\n\uf8ec .. \uf8f7\n2n\n\uf8ed . \uf8f8\n\u03c9jn\u22121\n(\u22121)k\n\nwith corresponding eigenvalues \u03bckj = 1 \u2212 \u03c9j\nwhere \u03c9j = e2\u03c0ij/n , k = 1, 2 and j = 0, ..., n \u2212\n1. Noting that \u03bc1,0 = \u03bc2,0 = 0, the term u\u2020 V u\nin the exponent of (17) can thus be simplified to\nP2 Pn\u22121\n2\nu\u2020 V u = v\u2020 Dv = k=1 j=1 \u03bckj vkj\n, with v\u2020 \u2261 u\u2020 U .\nThe limit thus becomes:\nn\u22121\nY\nexp[\u2212(2~)\u22121 v\u2020 Dv]\n\u03b4(xi \u2212 x0 )\u03b4(pi \u2212 p0 ) .(20)\n=\nn\u22121\n~\u21920\n(2\u03c0~)\ni=1\n\nlim\n\nThis completes the derivation of Eq. (16), and thus\nproves (15).\nNext, we turn to prove that the limit given in (15)\nholds under time evolution. This is achieved by showing that quantum dynamics is reduced to Hamiltonian\ndynamics in the ~ \u2192 0 limit, provided an appropriate\ncorrespondence between classical and quantum systems\nis made. The proof is as follows.\nIn classical mechanics, a statistical distribution\nPC (x, p) evolving in time (the time index t is suppressed)\nunder some Hamiltonian H(x, p) obeys the well-known\nLiouville equation [24]. In terms of the characteristic\nfunction defined by PC (x, p) =\nR(Fourier transformed)\nd\u03bbd\u03bc P\u0303C (\u03bb, \u03bc)ei(\u03bbx+\u03bcp) , and an analogous definition for\nH(x, p), the equation translates to\nZ\nd\u03bb\u2032 d\u03bc\u2032 P\u0303C (\u03bb\u2032 , \u03bc\u2032 )H\u0303(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 , \u03bc \u2212 \u03bc\u2032 )\n\u2202t P\u0303C (\u03bb, \u03bc) =\n\u00d7 KC (\u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bb\u2032 , \u03bc\u2032 ) ,\n\n(21)\n\nwith a 'classical kernel' KC = \u03bb\u2032 \u03bc \u2212 \u03bb\u03bc\u2032 . Accordingly,\na general quantum state (also written in characteristic\n\n\f4\n\u2020\n\nform)\n\u03c1=\n\nZ\n\ndxdp\n\nZ\n\nd\u03bbd\u03bc ei(\u03bbx+\u03bcp) P\u0303Q (\u03bb, \u03bc)|\u03b1ih\u03b1| ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhose evolution is governed by the Hamiltonian [25]\nZ\nZ\n1\ndxdp d\u03bbd\u03bc ei(\u03bbx+\u03bcp) H\u0303(\u03bb, \u03bc)|\u03b1ih\u03b1| (23)\n\u0124 =\n2\u03c0~\nobeys the von Neumann equation \u2202t \u03c1 = i~\u22121 [\u03c1, \u0124]. Expressing the equation in terms of P\u0303Q (\u03bb, \u03bc) and H\u0303(\u03bb, \u03bc),\nthe equation takes the form (21) but with a 'quantum\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n~\nkernel' KQ = ~2 e 2 (\u03bb (\u03bb\u2212\u03bb )+\u03bc (\u03bc\u2212\u03bc )) sin ~2 (\u03bb\u2032 \u03bc \u2212 \u03bc\u2032 \u03bb). It\nis easy to check that lim KQ = KC , thus we have shown\n~\u21920\n\nthat every classical system may be viewed as a limiting\ncase of an appropriately constructed quantum system.\nTogether with the result of the classical limit of the relative entropy (15), the no-broadcasting theorem which\nstates that the monotonicity of relative entropy of two\ndensity operators is in conflict with quantum dynamics\nunder broadcasting, translates in the classical limit to\nits classical version [13], stating that the monotonicity of\n(classical) relative entropy is in conflict with Hamiltonian\ndynamics.\nAs with other results from quantum mechanics that\nhave their analogies and parallels in classical probabilistic\ntheories [22, 26, 27, 28, 29], the classical no-broadcasting\ntheorem can also be recovered from its quantum version.\nThis reduction is attributed to the fact that both quantum and classical information theories are based on common grounds and are described by analogous measures.\nWe have thus shown that no-broadcasting is indeed a\ngeneral principle, originating from fundamental concepts\nof information theory, in particular, the monotonicity of\nrelative entropy.\nWe believe that this may help to gain a better understanding of the relations between nonclonability and\nreversibility properties both in quantum and in classical\nphysics. This proof may also provide a further clarification on \"quantumness\" versus \"classicality\" in that context, in particular in connection with a recent result by\nWalker and Braunstein [22], who proved the realizability\nof approximate classical broadcasting of statistical distributions with any desired degree of accuracy.\nWe thank Venketeswara Pai, Sam Braunstein, Gilad\nGour, Ady Mann, and two anonymous referees for useful\ncomments.\n\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: amirk@techunix.technion.ac.il\n\nElectronic address: itayhe@post.tau.ac.il\n[1] C.A.
