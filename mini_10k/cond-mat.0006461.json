The tunnel conductance was measured as a function of energy and temperature. At low\ntemperatures, the spectra reveal a minimum at zero bias voltage due to the Coulomb gap. In the\ntemperature range above 1 K the Coulomb gap is filled by thermal excitations. This behavior is\nreflected in the temperature dependence of the variable-range hopping resitivity measured on the\nsame samples: Up to a few degrees Kelvin the Efros-Shkovskii lnR \u221d T \u22121/2 law is obeyed, whereas\nat higher temperatures deviations from this law are observed, indicating a cross-over to Mott's\nlnR \u221d T \u22121/4 law. The mechanism of this cross-over is different from that considered previously in\nthe literature.\nPACS numbers: 74.50.+r, 74.40.+k, 74.60.Jg, 73.40.Jn\n\nfilling of the Coulomb gap with increasing temperature\nwas predicted by Monte-Carlo simulations of a classical\nCoulomb glass [10\u201312]. More recently, it was observed by\ntunneling sprectroscopy on Si:B samples near the metalnonmetal transition. The temperature dependence of the\nDOS should, in turn, affect the temperature dependence\nof the bulk resistivity. Surprisingly, except for Ref. [12],\nthis effect has not yet been taken into account in the\nliterature.\nIn this letter we present evidence that in insulating\ndoped Ge the second mechanism is verified. We show\nby comparing the temperature dependence of the DOS,\nderived by tunneling spectroscopy, with that of the VRH\nresistivity that the observed deviations from the ES\nlaw above 1 K correspond to the thermal filling of the\nCoulomb gap and not to the traditional cross-over mechanism.\nThe electronic DOS in solids can be dicectly probed by\ntunneling spectroscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy,\nfor example. But the small size of the width of the\nCoulomb gap \u2206CG strongly restricts the useful spectroscopic techniques. At present only the tunneling spectroscopy has the required energy resolution. Massey and\nLee were the first to directly observe the Coulomb gap\nin a doped uncompensated semiconductor Si:B [13\u201315].\nThey used planar tunnel junctions between boron-doped\nSi samples and a Pb counter-electrode with an insulating\ndielectric as barrier. The superconducting quasi-particle\nDOS of the lead electrode has been observed, proving\nquantum tunneling. Suppressing superconductivity of\nlead in a magnetic field of B = 200 mT allowed then\nto measure the DOS of the Si:B electrode against the\nconstant DOS of normal lead. However, planar tunnel\njunctions are difficult to prepare, especially with germanium.\n\nThe electronic density of states (DOS) near the Fermi\nlevel is an important physical quantity for understanding\nelectrical transport mechanisms in strongly localized systems [1], like impurity bands in doped semiconductors.\nThey consist of sites with random positions and random\nenergies [2,3]. The electron wavefunction is localized with\na localization radius a smaller than the average nearestneighbor distance between sites which is of order N \u22121/3\n(N \u2261 concentration of impurities). At low temperatures\nthe electrical resistivity of such systems is governed by\nvariable-range hopping (VRH), which means that the activation energy for a hopping process decreases continuously with temperature [2,3]. The role of the inter-site\nCoulomb interaction between electrons in the hopping\nregime was first addressed by Pollak [4] and by Srinivasan\n[5]. They showed that in localized systems the Coulomb\ninteraction creates a deep depletion of the one-particle\nDOS near the Fermi energy EF . Efros and Shklovskii\n(ES) called this depletion 'Coulomb gap' and showed that\nthe DOS near EF varies as g(E) = g0 (E \u2212 EF )D\u22121 for dimensionalities D = 2 and D = 3, respectively [6,3]. This\nleads to a VRH hopping resistance R \u221d exp (TES /T )1/2\n1/4\n[6,7], in contrast to Mott's R \u221d exp (TM /T )\nlaw [2] for\nwhich a constant DOS g(E) = g0 is assumed.\nA cross-over between these two temperature laws has\nbeen expected theoretically [3] and also observed experimentally [8,9]. According to the traditional interpretation of this cross-over the energy range of the phononassisted tunneling (hopping) becomes larger than the\nwidth of the Coulomb Gap \u2206CG above the cross-over\ntemperature. In this case the Coulomb gap does not affect the hopping resistance, thus resulting in Mott's law.\nHowever, another kind of crossover from an ES-type to\nMott-type temperature law may occur, namely the filling of the Coulomb gap by thermal excitations. Such a\n1\n\n\fAs alternative method we have proposed recently that\nit is possible to realize tunneling across a semiconductor\nbreak junction due to the lateral confinement of small\npoint contacts [16]. This is a well established technique\nto investigate superconductors and metals, both in the\nregime of direct metallic contact and tunneling across\na vacuum barrier [17]. To ensure a voltage drop confined to the junction itself the contact resistance is set\nto a value larger than about 10 k\u03a9 at 1 K. Our junctions\nhave lateral dimensions of less than about 100 nm. The\nhopping length amout to about 150 nm at 1 K increasing towards lower temperatures. Charge is transported\nacross the junction by a single hopping event at a rather\nwell-defined energy. This justifies our calling the transport tunneling and to interpret the voltage drop as an\nexcitation energy. On the other hand, the contact diameter must be large enough to inhibit the formation of a\ndepletion layer. Such a layer adds an additional tunneling barrier [18], and it may also vary the local DOS in\nthe contact region. We estimate a \u223c 10 nm lower bound\nfor useful junctions.\nOur undoped samples were grown by the Chochralskii method using highly enriched (up to 93 % 74 Ge)\ngermanium. Neutron-transmutation doping (NTD) ensured excellent homogeneity of 75 As as shallow donors\n[9] . The main nuclear reaction of Ge with thermal neutrons is 74 Ge (n, \u03b3) 75 Ge \u2192 75 As. As by-product, a small\nfraction of 75 Ga is produced as acceptors. This gives a\ncompensation of K = NGa /NAs = 12 %, and sets the\nFermi level inside the impurity band. The donor concentration Nd = NAs was below, but close to, the disorderdriven metal-insulator transition of Ge at a critical impurity concentration of 3.4 * 1017 cm\u22123 [19].\nFor our tunneling experiments the samples were cut\ninto 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 10 mm3 slabs with a 0.5 mm deep groove to\ndefine the break position within the (111) cleaving plane\nof germanium. The samples were glued onto a flexible\nbending beam, electrically isolated but thermally well\ncoupled to the cold plate. They were broken at low temperatures in the ultra-high vacuum chamber of the refrigerator. The contact size could be adjusted in situ with a\nmicrometer screw and a piezo tube. For further details of\nthe setup see Ref. [20]. The dI/dU spectra of junctions\nwith small resistance (less than about 100 k\u03a9) were obtained by means of the standard four-terminal method\nwith current biasing. The current-voltage characteristics of junctions with high resistance (larger than about\n100 k\u03a9) was recorded using the standard two-terminal\nmethod with voltage biasing. In the latter case the bulk\nsamples contributed at most 5 % to the total resistance.\nAll investigated Ge break junctions have rather similar\ncharacteristics. Fig. 1 shows typical spectra of a sample with Nd = 1.26 \u00d7 10\u221217 cm\u22123 as function of voltage\nand temperature. The spectra have a pronounced minimum at low temperatures. We believe that this anomaly\nrepresents the Coulomb gap. Between 100 mK and 1 K\n\nthe spectra depend only weakly on temperature. Above\nabout T = 1 K the Coulomb gap becomes filled by thermal excitations. It has almost vanished at T = 6 K.\nIn order to investigate how this temperature dependence of the DOS affects the hopping resistivity, we have\nmeasured the resistance of the bulk sample using the\nstandard four-terminal technique. Fig. 2 shows the resistance as function of T \u22121/2 and T \u22121/4 , respectively.\nAt low temperatures lnR \u221d T \u22121/2 , as expected for the\nES law. The resistance deviates from this behavior at\nT \u22121/2 < 0.5 K\u22121/2 or at T > 4 K, nearly coincidig with\nthe temperature at which the Coulomb gap is suppressed\naccording to the tunnel data, see Fig. 1.\nWe have also considered the traditional scenario of the\ncrossover between the ES and Mott law in which one assumes that the hopping energy range becomes broader\nthan Coulomb gap [3]. \u00bfFrom an analysis similar to that\nof [21] for the traditional cross-over mechanism we obtained a width the Coulomb gap of \u2206CG = 0.25 meV\nwhich is considerably smaller than the observed \u2206CG =\n2.5 meV. But the latter value would correspond to a much\nhigher crossover temperature than observed experimentally.\nWe turn now to a more detailed discussion of the temperature dependence of the DOS. To extract the DOS\nfrom the spectra we first tried to remove the energydependent part at high voltages. Several possibilities\nwere tried, with only slight variation of the final result. According to Ref. [15], this high-energy\ntail can\np\nbe roughly described by g(E) \u221d 1 + (E \u2212 EF )/\u03b4. In\nthis model, the parameter \u03b4 represents a correlation energy, which is almost independent of impurity concentration. For our experiments \u03b4 \u223c 10 meV, a rather large\nvalue when compared to the results for Si:B [15]. Alternatively, a Schottky-type behaviour was used with\ndI/dU \u221d exp (U/U00 ). The parameter U00 may then\nrepresent the properties of an additional barrier due to\nthe depletion layer. As we do not know which of the\ntwo possibilities is correct, we normalize the spectra at\nlow temperatures with respect to that corresponding to\nthe highest temperature. The shape of those normalized\nspectra is almost flat outside the Coulomb-gap anomaly.\nThey are then fitted using\ng(E, T ) \u221d \u03b3(T ) + [1 \u2212 \u03b3(T )]\n\n|E \u2212 EF |s\n(\u2206CG (T )/2)s + |E \u2212 EF |s\n(1)\n\nThe parameter \u03b3 describes a 'residual' DOS at the Fermi\nlevel and \u2206CG is the width of the Coulomb gap (FWHM).\nThe DOS derived by ES is recovered when \u03b3 = 0 and\ns = 2 [3,6].\nThe experimental DOS of our samples strongly deviates from the simple square-law derived by ES [6,3], and\nwhich was also found experimentally for Si:B [13\u201315].\nTaking into account the Fermi distribution and the DOS\n2\n\n\fEq. 1 on both sides of the junction, our analysis yields\nfor the sample far from the metal-nonmetal transition\ns = 3. Fig. 3 shows how \u2206CG and \u03b3 depend on temperature. Both saturate at low temperatures. Analytical\nas well as numerical simulations for nonmetallic disordered systems have predicted several different relationships: power laws g(E, T = 0) \u221d (E \u2212 EF )D\u22121 [6,23] and\ng(E, T = 0) \u221d (E \u2212EF )2.7\u00b10.1 [10] as well as an exponential dependence g(E, T = 0) \u221d exp[\u2212(\u2206/(E \u2212 EF ))1/2 ]\n[24]. A power law with s = 3 is consistent with the results\nof Ref. [10].\nThe temperature dependence of the zero-bias DOS also\nreveals a power law N (EF , T ) \u221d T x with an exponent\nx = 0.8. This differs from x = 2.7 derived by [10], but it\nagrees quite well with x = 1 obtained by the simulations\nof Ref. [11].\nBecause of the experimental DOS, especially its strong\ntemperature dependence, the observed ES-type behaviour of the bulk resistivity needs an explanation. We\npropose the following scenario to interpret our results: i)\nAt low temperatures the Coulomb gap ist temperature\nindependent. This corresponds to the ES regime of the\nVRH conductivity; ii) the power law behaviour of the\nresidual DOS \u03b3(T ) causes the transition from the ES to\nthe Mott law; iii) at high temperature the DOS is constant and one expects a Mott-type VRH conductivity.\nThe mechanism of the transition between ES- and Motttype behaviour is therefore completely different from that\nconsidered in Refs. [3,21]\nTo summarize, the tunnel conductance of small break\njunctions of our germanium samples shows a minimum\nof the DOS near the Fermi level. This minimum represents the Coulomb correlation gap. Up to about 1 K, the\nwidth of this anomaly depends only weakly on T . This\nis the ES-regime. Above about 1 K, the anomaly smears\nout. Consequently deviations from the ES law occur.\nAbove about 6 K, the anomaly has vanished, and the\nDOS becomes constant. The sample is then in the Mott\nregime. According to our interpretation, the cross-over\nbetween ES and Mott law at such low temperatures is not\ndue to the temperature-enhanced range of hopping energies. But it origins from the suppression of the Coulomb\ngap by thermal excitations. These break-junction tunneling results are consistent with the electrical resistivity\nof the same samples, which also shows a rather wide temperature range for the transition between ES and Mott\nvariable-range hopping.\nAcknowledgments: This work was supported by the\nGerman SFB 252 Darmstadt/Frankfurt/Mainz and the\nRussian RFFI 97-02-18280.\n\n[1] P.
