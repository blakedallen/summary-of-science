The Langlands\nL-functions are expected to have holomorphic continuations \u2013 or sometimes\nmeromorphic continuations with poles only at certain specific points \u2013 and\nto satisfy functional equations. This has been established in relatively few\ncases so far, generally by one of two methods. One, the Langlands-Shahidi\nmethod, deduces the meromorphic continuation and functional equation from\nthe analogous properties of Eisenstein series \u2013 Eisenstein series induced from\nthe automorphic representation in question. The other is called the method\nof integral representations, although it is perhaps more a collection of very\nPartially supported by NSF grants DMS-0500922 and DMS-0601009, and DARPA\ngrant HR0011-04-1-0031\n\u2217\n\n1\n\n\fclever ideas than a systematic method. These integral representations express\nthe L-function as an integral of matrix coefficients (i.e., automorphic forms),\nor products of matrix coefficients, of the automorphic representation; the\nfunctional equation then follows by applying some appropriate involution,\nwhich has the desired effect on the argument of the L-function.\nThe Langlands-Shahidi method presents the functional equation in exactly the form conjectured by Langlands, with the Gamma factors predicted\nby him. Its range of applicability is limited, because the group which acts on\nthe automorphic representation must arise as Levi component of a maximal\nparabolic in some ambient group. The method of integral representations\ntypically does not produce the Gamma factors directly. As a result, this\nmethod cannot always rule out all unwanted poles of the L-function. The\nsame is true, for different reasons, of the Langlands-Shahidi method.\nIn the papers [4, 5] we have introduced a new approach: we work not\nwith matrix coefficients of an automorphic representation, as in the method\nof integral representations, but with its automorphic distribution. The latter,\nin effect, is the datum of the embedding of the automorphic representation\ninto L2 (\u0393\\G); it does not involve the choice of particular matrix coefficients.\nOur approach has the advantage of making the Gamma factors computable\nand allows us to rule out all the unwanted poles. There is a cost, of course \u2013\ndistributions are more difficult to work with than C \u221e functions.\nIn this paper we develop an important analytic tool for our program,\nthe analogue, in the setting of automorphic distributions, of Rankin-Selberg\ntype integrals. Those are integral representations of L-functions, as integrals\nof products of automorphic forms \u2013 i.e., multilinear pairings of automorphic\nforms. The analytic properties of the L-functions are then deduced from the\nintegrals in question. Our main result, theorem 2.30, provides an alternative\nby establishing an invariant multilinear pairing of automorphic distributions.\nIn our forthcoming paper [7] we shall use a particular instance of our pairings\nto obtain new analytic information, such as the full analytic continuation, of\nthe exterior square L-function for GL(2n). We intend to use theorem 2.30\nin the future to obtain new results on other L-functions, results that are\ninaccessible by the Rankin-Selberg and Langlands-Shahidi methods. Indeed,\nfor every integral representation we are aware of, there exists an analogous\ndistributional pairing of the type covered by theorem 2.30.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nStatement of the main theorem\n\nOur main result involves two reductive Lie groups, G and H. We suppose\nthat both are finite covers \u2013 typically but not always the trivial cover \u2013 of\nthe groups of real points of algebraic reductive subgroups GQ \u2282 GL(NG , Q)\nand HQ \u2282 GL(NH , Q), respectively. By an arithmetic subgroup \u0393 \u2282 G, we\nmean a subgroup commensurate with the inverse image, in G, of the group\nof integral points GZ \u2282 GL(NG , Z). We use the same terminology in the case\nof H, of course. We shall suppose that G is realized as a subgroup of H, via\nan inclusion\n(2.1)\n\nG \u0592\u2192 H\n\nthat is defined over Q ; in other words, the inclusion is compatible with a\nQ-homomorphism GQ \u2192 HQ . It then follows that any arithmetic subgroup\nof \u0393H \u2282 H intersects G in an arithmetic subgroup \u0393G \u2282 G. To simplify\nvarious statements, we suppose that\n(2.2)\n\nZH , the center of H , is compact.\n\nIn the context of automorphic forms on H, that is not a restrictive hypothesis:\nany automorphic form on which the center of H acts according to a character\nis completely determined by its restriction to the derived group [H, H].\nWe consider a generalized real flag variety Y for H \u2013 a compact real algebraic variety with a transitive action of H, such that the isotropy subgroups\nare parabolic. If we let P denote the isotropy subgroup at some base point\ny0 \u2208 Y , we can make the identification\n(2.3)\n\nY \u223c\n= H/P ,\n\ny0 \u223c\n= eP .\n\nWe do not require that the parabolic subgroup P \u2282 H be defined over Q .\nVia the embedding (2.1) G acts on Y . In addition, we consider the datum\nof a connected unipotent subgroup U \u2282 H, which is normalized by G and\ndefined over Q , such that\na) U is the unipotent radical of a Q-parabolic subgroup PU \u2282 H,\n(2.4)\n\nb) G \u2282 MU for some Langlands decomposition PU = MU *AU *U,\nc) U * G has an open orbit O in Y , and\nd) G preserves the bi-invariant measure on U.\n3\n\n\fSince G is reductive and normalizes U it can be extended to a Levi component\nof PU . Thus b) is implied by the simpler, but more restrictive condition\n(2.4)\n\nb\u2032 ) ZG , the center of G, is compact.\n\nWe note that the semidirect product U * G is defined over Q , since both\nfactors are.\nAt this point two examples may be helpful. In the first, G is the group\n\u00b11\nSL (n, R) equipped with the standard Q-structure, H = G \u00d7 G \u00d7 G, which\ncontains G diagonally, and U = {e}. Thus a) and d) are vacuously satisfied,\nand the semisimplicity of G implies b). Let Xn denote the flag variety of\nG = SL\u00b11 (n, R),\n(2.5)\n\nXn = { 0 = F0 \u2282 F1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Fk \u2282 * * * \u2282 Fn = Rn | dim Fk = k } .\n\nThen G acts on Xn with isotropy subgroups conjugate to the lower triangular\nsubgroup. Note that RPn\u22121 is a generalized flag variety for G. The product\nY = Xn \u00d7 Xn \u00d7 RPn\u22121 can be regarded as a generalized flag variety for H.\nIt is not difficult to see that G, via the diagonal embedding G \u0592\u2192 G \u00d7 G, has\na unique open orbit in Xn \u00d7 Xn , and that the isotropy subgroup of G at any\npoint of the open orbit is G-conjugate to the diagonal Cartan subgroup. The\ndiagonal Cartan has a unique open orbit in RPn\u22121 . It follows that U * G = G\nhas a unique open orbit O in Y = Xn \u00d7Xn \u00d7RPn\u22121 , so (2.4c) is also satisfied.\nFor the second example, G is again SL\u00b11 (n, R) with the standard Qstructure, H = SL\u00b11 (2n, R) \u00d7 G, also with the standard Q-structure,\n\u0012\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\ng 0\n(2.6)\nG \u220b g 7\u2192\n, g\n\u2208 H = SL\u00b11 (2n, R) \u00d7 G\n0 g\ndescribes the embedding of G into H, and Y = X2n \u00d7 RPn\u22121 , which is a\ngeneralized flag variety for H. The abelian subgroup\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u001a\u0012 \u0012\ne c\n, e\nc \u2208 M(n \u00d7 n, R)\n(2.7)\nU =\n0 e\nof H is unipotent, defined over Q, and normalized by G. It can also be\ndescribed as the unipotent radical of the (n, n) parabolic in SL\u00b11 (2n, R),\nhence as the unipotent radical of a Q-parabolic subgroup of H. Again the\nsemisimplicity of G implies b). The conjugation action of G = SL\u00b11 (n, R)\non M(n \u00d7 n, R) preserves the Euclidean measure, so d) is satisfied. The\n4\n\n\fassertion c) can be reduced to the corresponding assertion about the first\nexample: when we embed Xn \u00d7 Xn diagonally into X2n , and correspondingly\nXn \u00d7 Xn \u00d7 RPn\u22121 into Y , the U-translates of Xn \u00d7 Xn \u00d7 RPn\u22121 sweep out a\ndense open subset of Y ; thus, since G has an open orbit in Xn \u00d7 Xn \u00d7 RPn\u22121 ,\nU * G = G* U does have an open orbit O \u2282 Y .\nWe need to briefly recall the notion of an automorphic distribution.\nLet \u0393H \u2282 H denote an arithmetic subgroup. Then H acts unitarily on\nL2 (\u0393H \\H), via right translation. An automorphic representation consists of\nan irreducible unitary representation (\u03c0, V ) of H, together with a H-invariant\nembedding\n(2.8)\n\nj : V \u0592\u2192 L2 (\u0393H \\H) .\n\nIf v \u2208 V is a C \u221e vector1 , then j(v) is a \u0393H -invariant C \u221e function on H.\nThat makes evaluation of j(v) at e \u2208 G meaningful. The linear map\n(2.9)\n\n\u03c4j : V \u221e \u2212\u2192 C ,\n\n\u03c4j (v) = j(v)(e) ,\n\ndefined on the space of C \u221e vectors V \u221e , is continuous with respect to the\nintrinsic topology on V \u221e , and is also \u0393H -invariant. Thus \u03c4j can be regarded\nas a \u0393H -invariant distribution vector for the dual representation (\u03c0 \u2032 , V \u2032 ),\n(2.10)\n\n\u03c4j \u2208 ((V \u2032 )\u2212\u221e )\u0393H .\n\nWe refer to \u03c4j as the automorphic distribution associated to the automorphic\nrepresentation (2.8). It completely determines j, since V \u221e is dense in V and\nj(v)(h) = (\u03c0(h)j(v))(e) = h\u03c4j , \u03c0(h)vi for all v \u2208 V \u221e , h \u2208 H.\nTo simplify the notation, we drop the subscript j, and we interchange the\nroles of (\u03c0, V ) and its dual (\u03c0 \u2032 , V \u2032 ); from now on,\n(2.11)\n\n\u03c4 \u2208 (V \u2212\u221e )\u0393H .\n\nWe shall also relax the assumption that \u03c4 corresponds to an irreducible subspace of L2 (\u0393H \\H), as in (2.8\u20132.9): in the discussion that follows, \u03c4 will\ndenote an arbitrary \u0393H -invariant distribution vector for an admissible representation (\u03c0, V ) of finite length, on a reflexive Banach space2 . In particular,\n\u03c4 may denote the automorphic distribution arising from an Eisenstein series.\n1\n2\n\ni.e., a vector such that H \u220b h 7\u2192 \u03c0(h)v is a C \u221e V -valued function on H.\nFor an expository discussion of these matters see [6, \u00a75 and appendix].\n\n5\n\n\fWe return to the situation of a generalized real flag variety Y \u223c\n= H/P ,\nwith P \u2282 H parabolic, but not necessarily defined over Q . To any finite\ndimensional complex representation\n(2.12)\n\n\u03bc : P \u2192 GL(E)\n\nwe associate the H-invariant vector bundle E \u2192 Y modeled on E. In other\nwords, E is a vector bundle to which the action of H on Y lifts, and whose\nfiber at the identity coset y0 \u223c\n= eP is isomorphic to E as a P -module. Tracing\nback through the definition, one obtains the description\nC\u221e\n\n(2.13) C \u221e (Y, E) \u223c\n= { f : H \u2212\u2192 E | f (hp) = \u03bc(p\u22121 )f (h) for h \u2208 H, p \u2208 P }\nof its space of C \u221e sections. This isomorphism relates the action of H on the\nspace of smooth sections C \u221e (Y, E), by means of the structure of equivariant\nvector bundle, to the action, via left translation, on the space of smooth\nE-valued functions on H.\nWe follow the convention of using the term \"distribution\" in the sense\nof \"generalized function\": scalar valued distributions are dual to smooth\nmeasures, and thus continuous functions can be viewed as distributions. In\ncomplete analogy to (2.13), there exists a natural, H-invariant isomorphism\nC \u2212\u221e\n\n(2.14) C \u2212\u221e (Y, E) \u223c\n= {\u03c3 : H \u2212\u2192 E | \u03c3(hp) = \u03bc(p\u22121 )\u03c3(h) for h \u2208 H, p \u2208 P }\nbetween the space C \u2212\u221e (Y, E) of sections of E with distribution coefficients\nand the space of E-valued distributions on H which transform in the specified\nmanner under right translation by elements of H. The identity \u03c3(hp) =\n\u03bc(p\u22121 )\u03c3(h) has only symbolic meaning, of course, since distributions cannot\nbe evaluated at points.\nWhen one puts a Riemannian metric on Y and a hermitian metric on\nthe vector bundle E, it makes sense to consider the space of all L2 sections\nof E \u2192 Y . That is a Hilbert space, on which H acts continuously, but\ngenerally not unitarily. The resulting representation of H is known to be\nadmissible, of finite length. Its spaces of C \u221e and distribution vectors are\nnaturally isomorphic to the spaces (2.13) and (2.14), respectively. From now\non we keep fixed an arithmetic subgroup \u0393H \u2282 H and a particular\n(2.15)\n\n\u03c4 \u2208 C \u2212\u221e (Y, E)\u0393H .\n\n6\n\n\fThen \u03c4 is an automorphic distribution in the sense of our earlier discussion.\nAccording to the Casselman embedding theorem [2] and results of CasselmanWallach [8, \u00a711], the space of distribution vectors for any irreducible unitary\nrepresentation can be embedded into the space of distribution vectors (2.14),\nwith appropriate choices of Y and E. In that sense, all automorphic distributions \u03c4j that encode irreducible subspaces of L2 (\u0393H \\H) as in (2.8\u20132.9) can\nbe realized as in (2.15); for details see [4, 5].3\nWe denote the action of H on sections of E \u2192 Y , and also on functions\nand distributions on H, by the letter l, for left translation. In analogy to\nthe case of automorphic forms, the automorphic distribution \u03c4 is said to be\ncuspidal if\nZ\n(2.16)\nl(n)\u03c4 dn = 0\nN/(\u0393H \u2229N )\n\nfor any unipotent subgroup {e} =\n6 N \u2282 H which arises as the unipotent\nradical of a Q-parabolic subgroup P \u2282 H. We also need a weaker notion.\nSuppose\n(2.17)\n\nH = H1 \u00d7 H2\n\n(in the category of groups defined over Q)\n\ncan be expressed as the product of two reductive, non-abelian factors. We\nshall then say that \u03c4 is cuspidal with respect to the factor H1 if the integral\n(2.16) vanishes for any unipotent subgroup {e} =\n6 N \u2282 H1 which arises as\nthe unipotent radical of a Q-parabolic subgroup P \u2282 H1 . That will be a\npotential hypothesis in the statement of our main theorem, but under the\nadditional assumption that\n(2.18)\n\nthe projection of G \u2282 H into Hj has a finite kernel,\n\nfor both j = 1, 2.\nRecall the conditions (2.4). We choose a base point o \u2208 O and let (UG)o\ndenote the isotropy subgroup of U * G at o . The surjective map\n(2.19)\n\np : U * G \u2212\u2192 O ,\n\n3\n\np(u g) = u g*o ,\n\nIn those references, we consider only line bundles, rather than vector bundles E \u2192 Y .\nFor linear groups, line bundles suffice. In this paper we also consider nonlinear groups.\nThe Cartan subgroups of a non-linear group H need not be abelian, which necessitates\nworking with representations parabolically induced from finite dimensional representations\nof dimension greater than one \u2013 or in geometric terms, with vector bundles rather than\nline bundles.\n\n7\n\n\finduces a (U * G)-equivariant identification O \u2243 (U * G)/(UG)o . Distribution\nsections of the H-equivariant vector bundle E \u2192 Y can be restricted to the\nopen subset O \u2282 Y , and then pulled back from O \u2243 (U* G)/(UG)o to U* G\nvia p. We choose s \u2208 H so that\n(2.20) o = sP \u2208 H/P \u223c\n= Y, and consequently (UG)o = (U * G) \u2229 sP s\u22121.\nThe (U * G)-equivariant vector bundle E|O \u2192 O \u223c\n= (U * G)/(UG)o is attached\nto the representation\n(2.21)\n\n(UG)o \u220b v 7\u2192 \u03bc(s\u22121vs) \u2208 GL(E) ,\n\nhence, in analogy to (2.14),\n(2.22)\nC \u2212\u221e\n\nC \u2212\u221e (O, E) \u2243 { \u03c3 : (U * G) \u2212\u2192 E | r(v)\u03c3 = \u03bc(s\u22121 v \u22121 s)\u03c3 for v \u2208 (UG)o } .\nHere r denotes the right translation action on possibly vector valued functions\nand its natural extension to distributions.\nEven if the representation (2.12) is irreducible, its restriction to s\u22121 (UG)o s\nmay well have a trivial quotient. We suppose that is the case4 , and fix\n\u0001\n(2.23)\nq : E \u2212\u2192 C\n(s\u22121 (UG)o s)-equivariant projection .\nComposing, from right to left, restriction of sections of E from Y to O,\npullback from O to U* G, and the projection q from E to C, we obtain a map\npe\u2217 from C \u2212\u221e (Y, E) to scalar valued distributions on U * G,\n(2.24)\n\npe\u2217 : C \u2212\u221e (Y, E) \u2212\u2192 C \u2212\u221e (U * G) .\n\nIn terms of the isomorphisms (2.14) and (2.22), is given by the explicit formula\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(2.25)\npe\u2217 \u03c3 (ug) = q \u03c3(ugs) .\n4\n\nThis hypothesis is necessary to construct the distributional pairing. Geometrically\nit means that the restriction of E to the open orbit O has a U * G-equivariantly trivial\nrank one quotient bundle. When we are dealing with a line bundle L rather than a vector\nbundle E \u2013 cf. the previous footnote \u2013 it reduces to the assumption that the restriction\nof L to O is U * G-equivariantly trivial. In some applications, such as [7], it is vacuously\nsatisfied.\n\n8\n\n\fThen pe\u2217 is (U * G)-equivariant by construction. In particular, it maps \u0393H invariant distribution sections, such as \u03c4 , to scalar distributions invariant\nunder both \u0393H \u2229 U and \u0393H \u2229 G.\nTo continue with the hypotheses of our main theorem, we note that the\ntwo subgroups\n(2.26)\n\n\u0393G = \u0393H \u2229 G \u2282 G\n\nand\n\n\u0393U = \u0393H \u2229 U \u2282 U\n\nare arithmetic. Since G normalizes U, \u0393G normalizes \u0393U ; moreover\n(2.27)\n\n\u0393U \\U is compact,\n\nas is the quotient of any unipotent linear group over Q modulo an arithmetic\nsubgroup. For any character\n(2.28)\n\n\u03c8 : U \u2192 C\u2217 such that\na) \u03c8 \u2261 1 on \u0393U , and\nb) \u03c8(gug \u22121) = \u03c8(u) for all g \u2208 G , u \u2208 U ,\n\nwe define the averaging operator\n(2.29)\n\nA\u03c8 : C \u2212\u221e (Y, E)\u0393H \u2212\u2192 C \u2212\u221e (Y, E)\u0393U *\u0393G ,\nZ\n1\nA\u03c8 (\u03c3) =\n\u03c8(u) l(u)\u03c3 du .\nvol(U/\u0393U ) U/\u0393U\n\nThis makes sense because of (2.4d) and (2.27\u20132.28). We shall briefly comment\non the analytic aspects of the definition in section 3.\nTheorem 2.30. Under the hypotheses just stated, for any \u03c6 \u2208 Cc\u221e (G),\nZ\nF\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 =def\n\u03c6(g) r(g) pe \u2217(A\u03c8 \u03c4 ) dg\nG\n\nis a left \u0393G -invariant smooth function on U * G, translating under the right\naction of U on U* G according to the character \u03c8, and under the left action of\nU according to the complex conjugate character \u03c8. In particular the restriction of F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 to G lies in C \u221e (\u0393G \\G). If \u03c4 \u2208 C \u2212\u221e (Y, E)\u0393H is cuspidal or\nis at least cuspidal with respect to one factor Hj in the setting (2.17\u20132.18),\nthis restricted function decays rapidly along all the cusps of \u0393G \\G, and the\nintegral\nZ\nF\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 (g) dg\n\u0393G \\G\n\n9\n\n\fconverges absolutely. The value of the integral does notR depend on the choice\nof \u03c6, provided \u03c6 satisfies the normalizing condition G \u03c6(g) dg = 1. If \u03c4\ndepends holomorphically on a parameter5 , then the value of the integral also\ndepends holomorphically on that parameter.\nLet us re-state the theorem informally, in more suggestive terms. First of\nall, the action of U * G on its open orbit O allows us to think of pe\u2217 (A\u03c8 \u03c4 ) \u2208\nC \u2212\u221e (U * G) as\nZ\n1\n\u2217\n(2.31)\npe (A\u03c8 \u03c4 )(ug) =\n\u03c8(u1)\u22121 q(\u03c4 (u1 ugs)) du1 .\nvol(\u0393U \\U) \u0393U \\U\n\nThis distribution transforms by the character \u03c8 in the u-variable, and thus\nhas smooth dependence on u \u2208 U. It therefore makes sense to speak of its\nrestriction to the G factor, in which it is formally automorphic under \u0393G .\nSuppose momentarily that \u0393G is cocompact in G. Then the integral of this\nrestriction over \u0393G \\G,\nZ\nZ\n1\n\u03c8(u)\u22121 q(\u03c4 (ugs)) du dg ,\n(2.32)\nvol(\u0393U \\U) \u0393G \\G \u0393U \\U\nmakes sense as the integral of a distribution against the smooth measure dg\nover a compact manifold. Right translating g by g1 \u2208 G does not change the\nvalue of (2.32), nor does integrating the resulting integral over g1 against a\nsmooth function \u03c6 of compact support and total integral 1. In other words,\nthe integral of the function\nZ Z\n1\n(2.33) F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 (g) =\n\u03c8(u)\u22121 q(\u03c4 (ugg1 s)) \u03c6(g1) du dg\nvol(\u0393U \\U) G \u0393U \\U\nover \u0393G \\G \u2013 the integral in the statement of the theorem \u2013 equals (2.32),\nagain assuming that \u0393G is cocompact in G. In the noncompact setting (where\nnearly all our applications lie), we cannot directly make sense of (2.32), but\nrather use (2.33) to define pairing in the statement of the theorem.\n5\n\nHolomorphic dependence is to be taken in the weak sense: a distribution \u03c3s depends\nholomorphically on the parameter s if the integral of \u03c3s against any test function depends\nholomorphically on s. Eisenstein distributions \u2013 the analogues of Eisenstein series in the\ncontext of automorphic distributions \u2013 are typical examples of distributions depending\nholomorphically on a parameter.\n\n10\n\n\fIn applications of theorem 2.30, H typically factors as a product H =\nH1 \u00d7 H2 , and correspondingly \u03c4 = \u03c41 * \u03c42 as the product of two automorphic distributions, one for each of the factors Hj . One can then think of the\nintegral of F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 in the theorem as defining a pairing between the two automorphic distributions. That is the reason for the title of our paper. Often\none of the factors \u03c4j is an Eisenstein series \u2013 not a classical Eisenstein series,\nof course, but its distribution version. Nonetheless one can \"unfold\", just\nas one does in the traditional Rankin-Selberg approach. This can be carried\nout in one of several ways, depending on the particular application \u2013 see, for\nexample, [5, 7]. For that reason, we shall treat the unfolding not here, but in\npapers in which we apply theorem 2.30.\nWe conclude with some explicit examples of pairings that are explained\nin further detail in [5]. Recall that s \u2208 H was introduced in (2.20) in order to\nidentify the quotient (U* G)/(UG)o with its open orbit O. It is a straightforward matter to make this explicit in any particular example. For instance,\nlet us consider the open orbit of G = SL\u00b11 (2, R) on RP1 \u00d7 RP1 \u00d7 RP1 that\nwas considered above in the earlier examples. If f1 = ( 10 01 ), f2 = ( 10 11 ), and\nf3 = ( 10 \u22121\n0 ), the diagonal action of G on H = G \u00d7 G \u00d7 G gives an open\norbit in the flag variety RP1 \u00d7 RP1 \u00d7 RP1 with basepoint represented by\ns = (f1 , f2 , f3 ) \u2208 H. Thus if \u03c41 , \u03c42 , and \u03c43 are automorphic distributions for\nG, the integral defined in theorem 2.30 is equal to\nZ\nZ\n(2.34)\n\u03c41 (ghf1 ) \u03c42 (ghf2 ) \u03c43 (ghf3 ) \u03c6(h) dh dg ,\n\u0393G \\G\n\nG\n\nand is related to the Rankin-Selberg L-function of \u03c41 \u2297\u03c42 when \u03c43 is an Eisenstein series distribution. As an example with a nontrivial unipotent integration, let us return to (2.6)-(2.7) and let \u03c41 be an automorphic distribution\nfor SL\u00b11 (4, R), and \u03c42 be an automorphic distribution for G = SL\u00b11 (2, R).\nThe integral defined in theorem 2.30 in this case is\n(2.35)\nZ\nZ Z\n\u0001\u0001\n1\n\u03c8(u)\u22121 \u03c41 u ghf1 ghf2 \u03c42 (ghf3 ) du dh dg ,\nvol(\u0393U \\U) \u0393G \\G G \u0393U \\U\nand is related to the exterior square L-function of \u03c41 when \u03c42 is an Eisenstein\nseries distribution.\n\n11\n\n\f3\n\nSmoothing the integrand\n\nIn this section we will first prove the invariance and smoothness properties\nasserted in theorem 2.30, and then give a construction of F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 as an integral\nof an automorphic form on H in lemma 3.9. The integral is then used in the\nfollowing section to prove the remaining properties asserted in the theorem.\nWe continue with the hypotheses and notation of the previous section, and\nreturn briefly to the definition (2.29) of the averaging operator A\u03c8 . Like the\nspace of distributions on any C \u221e manifold, C \u2212\u221e (Y, E) has an intrinsic topology as complete, locally convex, Hausdorff topological vector space. These\nare precisely the properties one needs to define the integral of a continuous,\ncompactly supported function with values in a topological vector space. The\naction of H on C \u2212\u221e (Y, E) is continuous by general principles. It follows\nthat u 7\u2192 \u03c8(u)l(u)\u03c4 , for \u03c4 \u2208 C \u2212\u221e (Y, E)\u0393H , can be regarded as a continuous\nfunction, defined on the compact manifold U/\u0393U , with values in the topological vector space C \u2212\u221e (Y, E). As such it has a well defined integral, which\nrepresents A\u03c8 \u03c4 .\nLet us first examine the smoothness and the invariance properties asserted\nby the theorem. For u \u2208 U,\nZ\n1\nl(u)(A\u03c8 \u03c4 ) =\n\u03c8(v)l(uv)\u03c4 dv\nvol(U/\u0393U ) U/\u0393U\nZ\n(3.1)\n1\n=\n\u03c8(u\u22121 v)l(v)\u03c4 dv = \u03c8(u) A\u03c8 \u03c4 ,\nvol(U/\u0393U ) U/\u0393U\nand therefore, in view of the (U * G)-equivariance of pe\u2217 ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nl(u) pe\u2217(A\u03c8 \u03c4 ) = \u03c8(u) pe\u2217 (A\u03c8 \u03c4 ) .\n\nIn terms of the identification U* G \u2243 U \u00d7 G, the distribution pe\u2217 (A\u03c8 \u03c4 ) transforms according to the character \u03c8 in the U-variable. Without loss of information, we can set the U-variable equal to the identity and \u2013 temporarily \u2013\nregard pe\u2217 (A\u03c8 \u03c4 ) as distribution on G. Convolution with a compactly supported smooth function turns any distribution on G into a smooth function.\nWe then put the U-variable back in and conclude:\nZ\n(3.3)\nF\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 =\n\u03c6(g) r(g) pe \u2217(A\u03c8 \u03c4 ) dg is a C \u221e function on U * G ,\nG\n\n12\n\n\ffor every \u03c6 \u2208 C \u221e (G). Convolution on the right commutes with left translation. Hence, for u \u2208 U, (3.2) implies\n(3.4)\n\nl(u)F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 = \u03c8(u)F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 .\n\nNow suppose g \u2208 G, u, u1 \u2208 U. Then, in view of (2.28b) and (3.4),\n(r(u)F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6)(u1 g) = F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 (u1 gug \u22121g) = (l((u1gug \u22121)\u22121 )F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 )(g)\n= \u03c8(u1 gug \u22121)F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 (g) = \u03c8(u)\u03c8(u1)F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 (g)\n(3.5)\n\u0001\n= \u03c8(u) l(u\u22121\n1 )F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 (g) = \u03c8(u)F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 (u1 g) ,\n\nso r(u)F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 = \u03c8(u)F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 . Since A\u03c8 \u03c4 is \u0393G -invariant on the left, since\npe\u2217 is G-equivariant, and since right and left translation commute,\n(3.6)\n\nl(\u03b3)F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 = F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 , for every \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393G .\n\nThese are the smoothness and the invariance properties of F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 , as asserted.\nFor the proof of rapid decay in the next section, we need to work with\nan auxiliary function \u03a6\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6,\u03c6U , whose definition involves the choice of some\n\u03c6U \u2208 Cc\u221e (U), in addition to \u03c4 , \u03c8, and \u03c6. We impose the normalization\nconditions\nZ\nZ\n\u03c6(g) dg = 1 ,\n\u03c6U (u) du = 1 ,\n(3.7)\nG\n\nU\n\nand regard q\u25e6\u03c4 as a scalar valued distribution on H, via (2.14) and (2.23).\nThat allows us to consider\nZ Z\n(3.8)\n\u03a6\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6,\u03c6U =\n\u03c6(g) \u03c6U (u) \u03c8(u) r(u) r(gs) q\u25e6\u03c4 du dg ,\nG\n\nU\n\nas a scalar distribution on H. Recall that s \u2208 H, as defined in (2.20), relates\nthe base points y0 \u2208 Y and o \u2208 O.\nLemma 3.9. \u03a6\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6,\u03c6U is a \u0393H -automorphic form6 on H \u2013 i.e., a \u0393H -invariant C \u221e function of uniformly moderate growth, which transforms finitely\nunder the action of the algebra of bi-invariant differential operators on H.\nMoreover, for all g \u2208 G,\nZ\n1\n\u03c8(u) (l(u) \u03a6\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6,\u03c6U ) (g) du = F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 (g) .\nvol(U/\u0393U ) U/\u0393U\n6\n\na smooth automorphic form, not required to transform finitely under the right action\nof a maximal compact subgroup, as is often assumed.\n\n13\n\n\fProof: Let E \u2217 \u2192 Y denote the H-invariant vector bundle dual to E, and\n\u2227top T \u2217 Y the top exterior power of the cotangent bundle of Y \u2013 i.e., the line\nbundle whose C \u221e sections are smooth measures on Y . We shall produce a\nsmooth section \u03c9 of the tensor product,\n(3.10)\nZ\n\u03c9 \u2208 C \u221e (Y, E \u2217 \u2297 \u2227top T \u2217 Y ) , such that \u03a6\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6,\u03c6U (h) =\n\nh l(h\u22121 )\u03c4 , \u03c9 i ;\n\nY\n\n\u22121\n\nhere h l(h )\u03c4 , \u03c9 i denotes the contraction between \u03c9 \u2208 C (Y, E \u2217 \u2297\u2227top T \u2217 Y )\nand l(h\u22121 )\u03c4 \u2208 C \u2212\u221e (Y, E), resulting in a scalar valued, distribution coefficient\nform of top degree on the compact manifold Y . As such, it can be integrated\nover Y against any smooth function, in particular the constant function 1.\nWe assume the existence of \u03c9 for the moment. In section 2 we mentioned\nthat C \u2212\u221e (Y, E) is the space of distribution vectors V \u221e for an admissible,\nrepresentation (\u03c0, V ) of H, of finite length, on a Hilbert space. Analogously\nits topological dual C \u221e (Y, E \u2217 \u2297 \u2227top T \u2217 Y ) can be regarded as the space of C \u221e\nvectors (V \u2032 )\u221e for the dual representation (\u03c0 \u2032 , V \u2032 ). If we now let h , i denote\nthe pairing between V \u2212\u221e and (V \u2032 )\u221e , we can rewrite the equality in (3.10) as\n(3.11)\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03a6\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6,\u03c6U (h) = h l(h\u22121 )\u03c4 , \u03c9 i .\n\nSince h 7\u2192 l(h\u22121 )\u03c4 is a smooth function on H, with values in the topological\nvector space V \u2212\u221e , and since the pairing is linear and continuous in each\nvariable, the description (3.11) exhibits \u03a6\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6,\u03c6U as a C \u221e function. Moreover, any function of this type, with \u03c4 \u2208 (V \u2212\u221e )\u0393H , is a C \u221e automorphic\nform [6, (2.15)].\nWe continue to assume the existence of \u03c9. We shall establish the identity\nstated at the end of the lemma. Since it only involves the values of \u03a6\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6,\u03c6U\non U * G, we now regard this function as defined on U * G, rather than on H\nas in (3.8). Recall the definition of the averaging operator A\u03c8 in (2.29). Left\nand right translation commute, hence\nZ\n1\n\u03c8(u) (l(u) \u03a6\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6,\u03c6U ) du =\nvol(U/\u0393U ) U/\u0393U\nZ Z\n=\n\u03c6(g) \u03c6U (u) \u03c8(u) r(u) r(g) pe \u2217(A\u03c8 \u03c4 ) dg du\nZU G\n(3.12)\n=\n\u03c6U (u) \u03c8(u) r(u)F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 du\nZU\n=\n\u03c6U (u) |\u03c8(u)|2 F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 du = F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 .\nU\n\n14\n\n\fAt the first step of this chain of equalities, we have used the definition (3.8)\nof \u03a6\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6,\u03c6U , the definition (2.29) of A\u03c8 , as well as the characterization\nof the map pe\u2217 in (2.24); at the second step we have used the definition of\nF\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 in the statement of the main theorem; and finally, in the third step,\nthe transformation law (3.5) and the normalization (3.7) of \u03c6U .\nWe shall construct \u03c9 first as a smooth, compactly supported, E-valued\nmeasure on O. Since O is open in Y , we can then regard \u03c9 as an element\nof C \u221e (Y, E \u2217 \u2297 \u2227top T \u2217 Y ). Recall the definition, above (2.19), of (UG)o as the\nisotropy subgroup of U* G at o = s*y0 \u223c\n= sP . Since U* G and P are defined,\nrespectively, over Q and over R ,\n(3.13)\n\n(UG)o = (U * G) \u2229 sP s\u22121\n\nis an R-subgroup of H . We define\n(3.14)\n\nf0 \u2208 Cc\u221e (U * G) ,\n\nf0 (ug) = \u03c6(g) \u03c6U (u) \u03c8(u) .\n\nNote that U* G is unimodular because of (2.4d). Haar measure on this group\ncan be described as the product du dg of the Haar measures on U and G.\nThe normalizations (3.7) imply that f0 du dg is well-defined, independently\nof the scaling of du and dg . We let (\u03bc\u2217 , E \u2217 ) denote the representation of P\ndual to (\u03bc, E), and choose e\u2217 \u2208 E \u2217 such that\n(3.15)\n\nq(e) = h e\u2217 , e i\n\nfor all e \u2208 E .\n\nUsing this notation, we interpret (3.8) as an identity between distributions\non H,\nZ\nh f0 (ug) e\u2217 , \u03c4 (hugs) i du dg .\n(3.16)\n\u03a6\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6,\u03c6U (h) =\nU *G\n\nThe group (UG)o may not be unimodular. We pick a left invariant Haar measure dv ; the particular normalization will turn out not to matter. Averaging\nfirst over (UG)o and integrating the result over the quotient (U * G)/(UG)o ,\nwe find\nZ\nZ\ndu dg\nh f0 (ugv) e\u2217 , \u03c4 (hugvs) i dv\n(3.17) \u03a6\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6,\u03c6U (h) =\n;\ndv\n(U *G)/(U G)o (U G)o\nhere du dg/dv is regarded as smooth measure on (U*G)/(UG)o in the obvious\nmanner.\n15\n\n\fAll along we have used (2.14) to regard \u03c4 as E-valued distribution on H,\ntransforming under right translation by p \u2208 P according to \u03bc(p\u22121 ). Hence\n(3.18)\n\nh f0 (ugv) e\u2217 , \u03c4 (hugvs) i = h f0 (ugv) e\u2217 , \u03bc(s\u22121 v \u22121 s)\u03c4 (hugs) i\n= h f0 (ugv) \u03bc\u2217(s\u22121 vs)e\u2217 , \u03c4 (hugs) i .\n\nThe C \u221e function f : U * G \u2192 E \u2217 , defined by\nZ\nf0 (ugv) \u03bc\u2217(s\u22121 vs)e\u2217 dv ,\n(3.19)\nf (ug) =\n(U G)0\n\nis well defined because the support of any left translate of f0 intersects (UG)o\nin a compact subset. As direct consequence of the construction,\n(3.20)\n\nf (ugv) = \u03bc\u2217 (s\u22121 v \u22121 s)f (ug)\n\nfor all v \u2208 (UG)o .\n\nThat, in analogy to (2.22) with C \u221e in place of C \u2212\u221e , allows us to regard f\nas a C \u221e section of E \u2217 \u2192 (U * G)/(UG)o \u223c\n= O . The fact that f0 has compact\nsupport in U * G implies the compact support, modulo (UG)o , of f ,\nf \u2208 Cc\u221e (O, E \u2217) .\n\n(3.21)\n\nAt this point we can reinterpret the outer integral in (3.17) as the integral\nof the smooth, compactly supported, E \u2217 -valued measure\n(3.22)\n\n\u03c9 = f\n\ndu dg\n\u2208 Cc\u221e (O, E \u2217 \u2297 \u2227top T \u2217 Y )\ndv\n\nagainst the E-valued distribution section l(h\u22121 )\u03c4 \u2208 C \u221e (Y, E). In effect, we\nhave verified (3.10), completing the proof of the lemma.\n\u0003\nTo construct \u03c9 in the preceding proof, we averaged f0 over (UG)0 on the\nright, and f0 involved the function \u03c6 as a factor. Hence:\nRemark 3.23. If the support of \u03c6 is kept fixed, the dependence of \u03c9 on \u03c6 is\nbounded in C k norm, for every k \u2208 N.\n\n4\n\nRapid decay\n\nIn this section we finish the proof of theorem 2.30, using lemma 3.9 as a\nmain tool. We shall use the results of [6], in particular theorem 4.7 of that\n16\n\n\fpaper. The notation there differs from our current notation, since the two\npapers were written for different purposes. The role of the current ambient\ngroup H, or of its factors Hj in (2.17), is played by G in [6], and the role of\nthe unipotent group U by N1 . The group G in [6] satisfies exactly the same\nhypotheses as our ambient group H. Since our current G is reductive and\ndefined over Q , it can be extended to a Levi component, defined over Q , of\nthe parabolic subgroup PU \u2282 H. Thus we may assume that the Langlands\ndecomposition in (2.4b) is defined over Q. That, in view of (2.28), makes G\na reductive Q-subgroup of the group denoted by L in [6, \u00a74]. If L1 \u2282 L2 is\nan inclusion of real reductive groups defined over Q , any Siegel set in L1 is\ncontained in the intersection of L1 with an appropriately chosen Siegel set\nin L2 . Thus, for statements about rapid decay on Siegel sets of automorphic\nforms on some ambient group, any decay statement for L2 directly implies\nthe analogous statement for L1 . In our words, for our purposes it is really\nirrelevant whether the current G is a subgroup of the L in [6, \u00a74], or all of it.\nLet us restate theorem 4.7 of [6] in our current notation. We consider\nthe automorphic form \u03a6\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6,\u03c6U on H associated to a cuspidal automorphic\ndistribution \u03c4 \u2208 C \u2212\u221e (Y, E) and \u03c9 \u2208 Cc\u221e (O, E \u2217 \u2297 \u2227top T \u2217 Y ) as in (3.10); in\nthe proof of lemma 3.9, \u03c9 was constructed in terms of q, \u03c8, \u03c6, \u03c6U , of course.\nThen for any Siegel set SG \u2282 G, any c in the inverse image of GQ in G \u2013 cf.\nthe discussion at the beginning of section 2 \u2013 and any n \u2208 N, there exists a\nconstant C > 0 such that\n(4.1)\n\nu \u2208 U , g \u2208 SG\n\n=\u21d2\n\n|\u03a6\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6,\u03c6U (u c g)| \u2264 Ckgk\u2212n .\n\nWhen F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 (u c g) is defined in terms of \u03a6\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6,\u03c6U by the formula in lemma\n3.9, the above estimate directly implies\n(4.2)\n\ng \u2208 SG\n\n=\u21d2\n\n|F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 (u c g)| \u2264 Ckgk\u2212n .\n\nA finite number of translates c SG cover \u0393G \\G, so (4.2) implies the integrability of F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 (u c g) over \u0393G \\G, at least when \u03c4 is cuspidal.\nThe preceding argument must be modified when \u03c4 is only cuspidal with\nrespect to one of the factors in a factorization (2.17) \u2013 say with respect to\nH1 for definiteness. In that situation [6, theorem 5.13] asserts the simultaneous rapid decay in the first factor and moderate growth in the second for\n\u03a6\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6,\u03c6U (h1 h2 ) , provided h1 varies in a Siegel set S1 \u2282 H1 and h2 over H2 .\nRapid decay trumps moderate growth when \u03a6\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6,\u03c6U is restricted to U* G ;\nthis depends on the hypothesis (2.18), of course. Thus both (4.1) and (4.2)\nremain valid even in the partially cuspidal case.\n17\n\n\fOnly two assertions remain to be verified to complete the proof of theorem\n2.30. First of all, we need to show that the integral\nZ\nZ\nZ\n(4.3)\nF\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 (g) dg =\n\u03c6(g1 ) pe\u2217 (A\u03c8 \u03c4 )(gg1) dg1 dg\n\u0393G \\G\n\n\u0393G \\G\n\nG\n\ndepends only on the total integral of the smoothing function \u03c6, but not\notherwise on the particular choice of \u03c6. Since the measure on \u0393G \\G is Ginvariant on the right, we can right translate the argument g by any fixed\ng2 \u2208 G without changing the value of the integral (4.3). Equivalently, we\ncan replace \u03c6 by l(g2 )\u03c6 without affecting the integral. On the infinitesimal\nlevel this means that the integral vanishes whenever \u03c6 = l(Z)\u03c6\u0303 is the left\ninfinitesimal translate of some \u03c6\u0303 \u2208 Cc\u221e (G) by some Z \u2208 g . Thus the integral\n(4.3) depends only on the image of \u03c6 in the quotient\n(4.4)\n\nCc\u221e (G)/l(g)Cc\u221e (G) .\n\nSince G is parallelizable, this quotient represents the top cohomology group\nof the de Rham complex with compact support. As such, it is naturally dual\nto H0 (G, C), and the duality is implemented by integration over the various\nconnected components of G. If G is connected, we can conclude that\nR\n(4.5)\nl(g)Cc\u221e (G) = { \u03c6 \u2208 Cc\u221e (G) | G \u03c6(g) dg = 0 } ,\nwhich implies the conclusion we want. The case of several connected components reduces readily to the connected case; what matters here is that\nreplacing \u03c6 by l(g2 )\u03c6, with g2 \u2208 G, does not affect the value of the integral.\nThe preceding argument involves interchanging the order of differentiation and integration. To make this legitimate, one needs to know that the\nabsolute convergence of the integral of F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 over \u0393G \\G can be estimated \u2013\nwhen \u03c4 , \u03c8, and the support of \u03c6 are kept fixed \u2013 in terms of some C k norm\non \u03c6. Recall the remark 3.23. Since F\u03c4,\u03c8,\u03c6 was expressed in terms of the\nautomorphic form \u03a6\u03c4,\u03c8,\u03c6,\u03c6U , which involves \u03c6 via \u03c9 in the identity (3.11),\nwe need to quantify the decay of \u03a6\u03c4,\u03c8,\u03c6,\u03c6U in terms of some C k norm of \u03c9,\nagain assuming \u03c4 is fixed. In the notation of [6, theorem 5.13], \u03c9 corresponds\nto the vector v. The estimate in that theorem depends linearly on the C k\nnorm of v, which provides the necessary justification.\nAs was remarked earlier, for us holomorphic dependence of a distribution\non a complex parameter means dependence in the \"weak sense\" \u2013 i.e., the\n18\n\n\fintegral of the distribution against any test function depends holomorphically\non the parameter in question. According to (3.10), the values of the function\n\u03a6\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6,\u03c6U can be interpreted as the result of paring the distribution section \u03c4\nof the vector bundle E over the compact manifold Y against a smooth measure\nwith values in the dual vector bundle. Thus, if \u03c4 depends holomorphically\non a complex parameter, then so does the function \u03a6\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6,\u03c6U , and in view\nof lemma 3.9, also the function F\u03c4,q,\u03c8,\u03c6 . This completes the proof of theorem\n2.30.\n\nReferences\n[1] A. Borel, Introduction aux groupes arithm\u00e9tiques, Actualit\u00e9s scientifiques et industrielles 1341, Hermann, Paris, 1969.\n[2] W.
