expansions of Feynman diagrams using the Mellin-Barnes representation.\n\n2. General lines of the strategy and some\nmathematical tools\n\n1. Introduction\nIn the Standard Model quantum field theories,\nwhere calculations of Feynman diagrams are often reduced to the evaluation of complicated integrals involving several scale parameters, exact\nresults are difficult to obtain. It is therefore legitimate to search to compute asymptotic expansions\nof these integrals in the various relevant limits\nof the parameters (or ratios of them). A powerful mathematical strategy to compute asymptotic\nexpansions of integrals depending on parameters\n(in the limits of small and/or large values of the\nparameters) is based on the Mellin-Barnes representation [4,5]. The use of Mellin-Barnes representation in quantum field theory goes back in\nref.[6] and many applications have been made\nsince then. In ref.[1] we have proposed a new way\nfor performing calculations within this strategy,\nusing a theorem and new mathematical objects\nrecently introduced in algorithmics [7]. In this\ntalk, we shall briefly describe these mathematical tools and show the power of our approach on\na few diagrams of interest for the investigation\nof the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.\nAs a pedagogical example, a very elementary calculation will be exposed in a detailed way.\n\nThe underlying mathematical procedure of our\nmethod can be nicely summarized in only one sentence [7]: \"For estimating asymptotically a function f (x) [in the limit of small or large x], determine its Mellin transform M[f ](s) and translate\nback its singularities into asymptotic terms in the\nexpansion of f (x)\".\nTherefore, in the case of a Feynman diagram,\nwe see that the problem is equivalent to get the\nMellin-Barnes representation of its corresponding\nFeynman integral in a first step (since the MellinBarnes representation is the other denomination\nof the inverse Mellin transform) and once done,\nin a second step, to care for the singular structure\nof its explicitly obtained Mellin transform.\nThe first step can be obtained in an easy manner: first use the Feynman parameterisation, then\ncompute the momenta integrals to get purely\nparametric integrals and finally introduce an appropriate Mellin-Barnes representation of part of\nthe integrand (or several if one has several convenient parameters). Then, commute integrals\nover Feynman parameters and the Mellin-Barnes\nrepresentation(s) and compute the parametric integrals. In this way, the result is a Mellin-Barnes\nrepresentation of the diagram where the Mellin\ntransform of the diagram, directly readable in\nthe integrand, is in general a product of Euler's\n\ngiven at the 12th High-Energy Physics International Conference on Quantum Chromodynamics, 4-8 July\n(2005), Montpellier (France).\n\n\u2217 Talk\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nS. Friot, D. Greynat\n\nGamma fonctions. In some of the examples that\nwe have considered, the cosecant function also appeared. In these cases, it can be more convenient\nto keep this function explicitly rather than to express it in terms of Gamma functions, since it can\nsupply useful simplifications of the calculations.\nTo deal with the second step of our problem,\nwe need to define two important mathematical\nobjects (the fundamental strip and the singular\nexpansion of the Mellin transform of our diagram)\nand to give a theorem (the converse mapping theorem). These tools have not been used previously\nin quantum field theory calculations but their efficiency in this context was clearly shown in our\nwork [1,2,3]. They are going to provide the dictionary between the singular structure of the Mellin\ntransform of the diagram and its asymptotic expansions.\nThe fundamental strip < \u03b1, \u03b2 > of the Mellin\ntransform M[f ](s) of a locally integrable function\nf (x) (where x is a positive real number) is the\nlargest open strip of the complex s-plane in which\nthe integral\nZ \u221e\nM[f ](s) =\ndxxs\u22121 f (x)\n0\n\nis convergent [7].\nThis fundamental strip can be easily found\nfrom the following conditions:\nIf f (x) = O(x\u2212\u03b1 ) and f (x) = O(x\u2212\u03b2 )\nx\u21920+\n\nx\u2192+\u221e\n\nwith \u03b1 > \u03b2 then M[f ](s) converges in < \u03b1, \u03b2 >\n(an alternative notation for the fundamental strip\nis R(s) \u2208]\u03b1, \u03b2[).\nThe singular expansion of the Mellin transform\nin a given region of the complex s-plane, outside\nof the fundamental strip and where it admits a\nmeromorphic continuation, is a formal sum collecting all singular elements of the Mellin transform in this region, a singular element (at a pole\np) being simply the truncated Laurent expansion\u0001\nof the Mellin transform, at order O (s \u2212 p)0\nor less (depending on the Laurent expansion),\naround this pole [7].

In the left region, the poles of\nthe Mellin transform are linked, by the converse\nmapping theorem, to the asymptotic expansion\nof the original function f (x) in the zero limit of\nx. But poles in the right region are linked to\nthe asymptotic expansion of f (x) in the infinite\nlimit of x. It is therefore crucial to identify the\nfundamental strip of the Mellin transform in order to know which poles are associated to which\nasymptotic expansion. This is in general easy\nin the case of Feynman diagrams. As described\nabove, when writing the Mellin-Barnes representation of a diagram (after that the corresponding\nFeynman integral has already been transformed\ninto purely parametric integrals), one uses the\nMellin-Barnes representation of part of the parametric integrand, so that one knows the fundamental strip for this expression (using the rules\nexplained above). Notice however that the evaluation of the parametric integrals, once their commutation with the Mellin-Barnes representation\nrealized, can reduce the size of the fundamental\nstrip. Therefore, the fundamental strip of the\nMellin transform of a diagram is obtained only\nafter evaluating the parametric integrals.\nSecondly, it is not necessary to compute the\nwhole singular expansion(s) if one is only interested in the first few terms, or in one particular\nterm, of the asymptotic expansion(s). In these\ncases, one only has to consider the closest poles\nto the fundamental strip, or the pole corresponding to the particular term, in the relevant half\ncomplex plane.\nFinally, in many cases (in particular in all cases\nthat we have considered so far), Mellin transforms admit a meromorphic continuation in the\ncomplete left and/or right half complex plane,\ntherefore complete asymptotic expansion(s) for\nthe original function can be found. Such expansions can be either convergent or divergent and,\nif convergent, they may in some cases represent\nthe function exactly [7].\n3. Applications: the anomalous magnetic\nmoment of the muon\nThe anomalous moment of the muon is a wellknown precision observable for testing the Stan-\n\ndard Model (for a recent review, see [8]).\nOne can easily use our method to compute the\nasymptotic expansions of the contributions to the\nanomaly of the diagrams of figure below (where\nl and l\u2032 are either electrons or taus with l 6= l\u2032 ,\nand H denotes a hadronic polarisation3 \u03a0H ). We\nhave therefore been able, among others, to directly check in [1,2,3] the results of [10] (diagram\n2 of our figure) and eq. (8) of [11] corresponding\nto diagrams 4 and 5 (notice that eq. (8) of [11] is\nnot valid for a tau in the electromagnetic polarisation). To be more precise, diagram 1 can be comm2\nm2\nputed in the m2l \u2192 +\u221e or m2l \u2192 0 limits and di\u03bc\n\u03bc\nagram 2 in both limits simultaneously. In the case\nof the other diagrams involving a hadronic polarisation, perturbative and non-perturbative contributions are involved and it is therefore better to\nseparate them with the use of a dispersion relation written for the hadronic polarisation. One\ncan then apply the asymptotic expansion procedure on the associated kernel function in the limit\nt\nm2\u03bc \u2192 +\u221e where t is the dispersive integration\nvariable.\n\nl\n\nl\n2\n\n1\n\nl\u2032\n\nH\n3\n\nH\n4\n\nl\n\nl\n5\n\nH\n\nAs a pedagogical example, let us consider one of\nthe simplest of these diagrams in a detailed manner, namely diagram number 3.\nOn can easily show that, once the dispersion\nrelation has been worked out for \u03a0H , the contribution of this diagram to the anomaly is F2 (0) =\nR\nt\n\u03b1 +\u221e\n\u03c0 4m2 dtI(\u03a0H (t))K2 ( m2 ), where\n\u03bc\n\n\u03c0\n\nK2\n\n\u0012\n\nt\nm2\u03bc\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\ndx\n\n1\u2212x\n\n1+\n\n(1\u2212x) t\nx2\nm2\u03bc\n\nis a well-known kernel function.

One then gets\n\u03bc\n\nK2\n\n\u0012\n\nt\nm2\u03bc\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n=\n2i\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nc+i\u221e\n\nds\n\nc\u2212i\u221e\n\n\u00d7\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u0012\n\nt\nm2\u03bc\n\n\u0013\u2212s\n\n\u03c0\nsin(\u03c0s)\n\ndx x2s (1 \u2212 x)1\u2212s .\n\n0\n\nThis last equation involves the integral representation of the Beta function B(2s + 1, 2 \u2212 s) which\nis equal to \u0393(2s+1)\u0393(2\u2212s)\nif R(2s + 1) > 0 and\n\u0393(s+3)\nR(2 \u2212 s) > 0. These conditions being always satisfied, since R(s) \u2208]0, 1[ (the fundamental strip of\neq.

The Mellin transform\nof the kernel function is then\n\u0014\n\u0015\nt\n\u0393(2s + 1)\u0393(2 \u2212 s)\n\u03c0\nM K2 ( 2 ) (s) =\nm\u03bc\nsin(\u03c0s)\n\u0393(s + 3)\n\n(2)\n\nof fundamental strip < 0, 1 >.\nSince we want the asymptotic expansion of K2\nin the infinite limit of mt2 , we need to compute\n\u03bc\nthe singular expansion of (2) to the right of the\nfundamental strip. Looking at (2), we see that\nit can be easily obtained by calculating its truncated Laurent series around an arbitrary strictly\npositive natural integer n (the only singular functions of (2) in the right half complex plane being\nthe cosecant and the \u0393(2 \u2212 s) functions).

For diagrams\n2, 4 and 5, calculations are slightly more complicated but remain still easy to perform [1,2,3].\nREFERENCES\n1. S. Friot,\nD. Greynat and E. de\nRafael, Phys. Lett.
