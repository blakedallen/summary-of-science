Indeed, even the conceptually simpler problem of\ndescribing high-spin particles in fixed external field backgrounds has proved itself fraught\nwith difficulties. As already noticed by Fierz and Pauli seventy years ago [2], a Lagrangian\nformulation of interacting high-spin fields is essential even at the classical level, to avoid\nalgebraic inconsistencies in the equations of motion. However, when the high-spin field\nis coupled to either external or dynamical fields, a Lagrangian formulation guarantees\nneither that no unphysical degrees of freedom start propagating, nor that the physical\nones propagate only causally.\nThis pathology is particularly vexing for the seemingly simple case of charged, massive\nparticles of spin 3/2. Their well-known free action was found in 1941 in [3], but it\ntook many years before realizing that minimal coupling to external electromagnetic fields\nresulted in equations of motion which exhibited faster-than-light propagation of signals [4]\n(see also [5]). This lack of causality also shows up in higher spin fields, such as spin 2 [6].2\nMassive, electrically charged states of spin 3/2 or higher do exist in QCD as resonances.\nMoreover, open string theory contains (infinitely) many charged, massive particles of spin\nhigher than one. 3 Both string theory and QCD are to the best of our understanding\nconsistent and causal, especially in the dynamical regime describing particles in fixed\nexternal electromagnetic fields. So, a natural question to ask is how the Velo-Zwanziger\nacausality problem is resolved, first of all in the simplest setting of them all: spin 3/2.\n\nPossible Solutions\nVarious scenarios exist for rescuing causality.\nAdding New Degrees of Freedom\nOne is that a single charged spin 3/2 field is inconsistent or non-causal when considered\nin isolation. It could happen that causality forces upon us the existence of other fields\nbesides the spin 3/2 one. After all, we do know an example of consistently propagating\ncharged spin 3/2 fields: N = 2 extended \"gauged\" supergravity [9]. In N = 2 theories,\nthe gravitino can be charged under a U(1) field (the graviphoton). Supersymmetry can\nbe broken without introducing a cosmological constant [10, 11], resulting in a massive\n2\n\nThe causality problem is a classical pathology; its quantum analog is that canonical commutators\nbecome ill-defined. The latter was noticed in [7] long before [4].\n3\nLight spin 3/2 particles may also appear in Randall-Sundrum models [8].\n\n1\n\n\fspin 3/2 field propagating in flat space. Causality in this case is due to gravitational\nback-reaction.\nMore specifically, as shown in [12], superluminal propagation of the mass m, charge\ne gravitino would occur in flat space when, in some Lorentz frame, the magnetic field\n\u221a\nB attains the critical value |B| = 3m2 /e. In that frame, the energy density T00 =\n1\n(E2 + B2 ) is always larger than 23 m4 /e2 . Since in this theory gravity is dynamical, the\n2\ngravitational back-reaction induces a curvature in space-time, characterized by a length\n2 2\nscale L\u22122 = O(3m4 /2MPl\ne ). But in N = 2 theories, the graviphoton charge of the\ngravitino and the Planck mass MPl are related by e = m/MPl ; therefore, space-time is\nsignificantly curved already at the Compton wavelength scale of the gravitino L = 1/m.\nThis is precisely the regime where the flat-space causality results of [4, 12] cease to apply.\nIndeed, ref. [13] extended the causality analysis done for pure supergravity\nin [14] to prove\nq\n\nthat N = 2 supergravity is causal and hyperbolic when m > 23 eMPl . 4\nThe main drawback of extended supergravity is that it cannot solve the causality\nproblem of spin 3/2 fields unless the charge obeys the \"Kaluza-Klein\" relation e = m/MPl .\nWhen \u2212 as for electromagnetic interactions \u2212 e is fixed (e \u2248 0.3), the gravitational backreaction of spin 3/2 particles much lighter than O(eMPl ) is negligible, so they can still\npropagate superluminally.\nAdding Non-Minimal Terms\n\nA different solution to the causality problem may be to change the minimal spin 3/2 theory\nnot by adding new dynamical degrees of freedom, but simply by adding non-minimal\ngauge invariant interactions. That this could be the right solution is strongly suggested\nby analogy with the only known example of a consistent model of high-spin particles of\narbitrary charge, which propagates causally in an external electromagnetic field, constant\nbut otherwise arbitrary. This is the Argyres-Nappi action [16]. It describes a single,\nmassive spin 2 field, charged under a U(1). Charge and mass are independent variables;\nin particular, a dynamical regime exists which decouples gravitational interactions, while\nkeeping the U(1) charge finite. The Argyres-Nappi action is highly non-minimal: it is\nquadratic in the charged spin 2 field but non-polynomial in the electromagnetic field\nstrength F\u03bc\u03bd . It was obtained from the equations of motion of charged open strings in a\nbackground with a nonzero, constant external field strength F\u03bc\u03bd .\nEven though derived within string theory, the reason why the Argyres-Nappi theory\nis causal and consistent is simple: After a straightforward redefinition of variables, its\nequations of motion enforce the standard transverse-tracelessness constraint on the spin 2\nfield h\u03bc\u03bd . By substituting the constraint into the equations of motion, one obtains a good\n4\n\nPartial results on causality of N = 2 and Kaluza-Klein supergravities can also be found in [15].\n\n2\n\n\fhyperbolic system, \u0003h\u03bc\u03bd + lower derivative terms = 0, which manifestly propagates five\ndegrees of freedom within the light cone.\nIt would be odd if what works with spin 2 does not work with spin 3/2, especially\nsince the reason for causality in the Argyres-Nappi action is not due to exotic properties\nof string theory, but rather to a clever combination of non-minimal terms. So, even for\nspin 3/2, it makes sense to consider a general non-minimal Lagrangian of the form 5\nL = \u2212i\u03c8\u0304\u03bc A\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 (F )D\u03bd \u03c8\u03c1 \u2212 i\u03c8\u0304\u03bc B \u03bc\u03bd (F )\u03c8\u03bd ,\n\nA\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 (F ) = \u03b3 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 + O(F ),\n\nB \u03bc\u03bd (F ) = m\u03b3 \u03bc\u03bd + O(F ).\n\n(1)\n\nThe non-minimal couplings A\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 (F ), B \u03bc\u03bd (F ) are functions of the electromagnetic field\nstrength F\u03bc\u03bd , analytic near F\u03bc\u03bd = 0. Their form will be specified later.\nWhat We Cannot Expect to Find\nBefore analyzing further eq. (1), it is important to understand clearly what problem we\nmust solve and which one we should not. Our aim is to find a Lagrangian that propagates\nwithin the light cone only four degrees of freedom \u2212 the four physical helicities of a spin\n3/2 field \u2212 in an external electromagnetic background. Our method will work for constant\nbackgrounds. While this is a drawback, it does take care of the original Velo-Zwanziger\nproblem, which manifests itself already for constant backgrounds [4].\nWe do not want to find a Lagrangian that works for arbitrarily large values of the\nrelativistic field invariants F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd , F\u03bc\u03bd F\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd 6 . The reason is that whenever these invariants\nbecome O(m4 /e2 ), several instabilities appear, that make the very concept of a longlived, propagating spin 3/2 field unphysical. One such instability is the Schwinger pair\nproduction [17], which becomes significant when F\u03bc\u03bd F\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd = 0 and F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd \u223c \u2212m4 /e2 .\nAnother is the spin 3/2 analog [18] of the Nielsen-Olesen instabilities [19], which appear\nwhen F\u03bc\u03bd F\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd = 0 and F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd \u223c +m4 /e2 . Though these instabilities are normally said\nto occur when either the electric field (Schwinger) or the magnetic field (Nielsen-Olesen)\nare O(m2 /e), it is important to realize that they only depend on relativistic invariant\ncombinations of the field strength. These instabilities mean that whatever Lagrangian\none may use to describe a spin 3/2 field in isolation, it will always be only an effective\none, reliable only when energies are sufficiently small and the relativistic field invariants\nare much smaller than O(m4 /e2 ). It is thus particularly telling that the Argyres-Nappi\nLagrangian becomes ill-defined precisely when the relativistic field invariants reach their\ncritical strength \u223c m4 /e2 [16].\n5\n\nOur conventions are as follows: the metric \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd is mostly plus, \u03c8\u0304\u03bc = \u03c8\u03bc\u2020 \u03b3 0 , \u03b3 \u03bc \u2020 = \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bc \u03b3 \u03bc ,\n1 \u03bc1 \u03bc2\n\u03b3 \u03b3 ..\u03b3 \u03bcn +\n\u03b3 5 = \u2212i\u03b3 0 \u03b3 1 \u03b3 2 \u03b3 3 . We always antisymmetrize with unit strength: \u03b3 \u03bc1 ....\u03bcn = n!\nantisymmetrization.\n6\nF\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = 12 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 F \u03c1\u03c3 with \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 totally antisymmetric and normalized as \u01eb0123 = +1.\n\n3\n\n\fThe Velo-Zwanziger problem is different in that it persists even at arbitrarily small\nvalues of the relativistic field invariants. q\nConcretely, in the minimal model, the\nq magnetic\n3 2\n7\nfield B can reach its critical value |B| = 2 m /e in a frame where |E| = 32 m2 /e \u2212 \u01eb,\nwith \u01eb an arbitrarily small number. So, it is a real problem that occurs within the regime\nof validity of the effective theory.\nThis is the problem we need to solve: we must find a non-minimal Lagrangian that\npropagates causally the correct number of degrees of freedom whenever |F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd | \u226a m4 /e2 ,\n|F\u03bc\u03bd F\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd | \u226a m4 /e2 .\nWe shall not worry if the Lagrangian fails whenever either of these invariants becomes\nO(m4 /e2 ), since in any case any Lagrangian treating the electromagnetic background as\nfixed is meaningless, because it fails to take into account large effects due to electromagnetic back-reaction.\n\nWhat is Not a Solution\nHermiticity of the Lagrangian in eq. (1) imposes some constraints on the coefficients\nA\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 (F ), B \u03bc\u03bd (F ), namely\n\u03b3 0 (A\u03c1\u03bd\u03bc )\u2020 \u03b3 0 = A\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 ,\n\n\u03b3 0 (B \u03bd\u03bc )\u2020 \u03b3 0 = \u2212B \u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(2)\n\nMoreover, unless A\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 and B \u03bc\u03bd are antisymmetric in their vector Lorentz indices, eq. (1)\npropagates additional degrees of freedom whenever F\u03bc\u03bd 6= 0. These degrees of freedom are\ndangerous because they interact through relevant and irrelevant interactions with the electromagnetic field, but are absent at F\u03bc\u03bd = 0, when the coefficients in the Lagrangian (1)\nare antisymmetric. So, their kinetic term is proportional to |F\u03bc\u03bd | and thus the strength of\nall their irrelevant interactions diverges in the weak field limit |F\u03bc\u03bd | \u2192 0. The existence\nof these unwanted degrees of freedom makes the solution of the Velo-Zwanziger problem\nproposed in the appendix of [20] unacceptable, as pointed out in [12]. Yet, the idea that\nnon-minimal interactions may cure the problem can be salvaged from that work, as we\nshall proceed to explain.\n\nConstraints\nWhat makes the Argyres-Nappi action work is that on an appropriately redefined spin 2\nfield it enforces the same constraint as the free action does, namely transverse-tracelessness 8 .\nSimilarly, here we demand that our non-minimal action enforce the constraint\n\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8\u03bc = 0.\n\u221a\n7\nFor minimal supergravity the critical value instead is |B| = 3m2 /e.\n8\nIn the notation of ref. [16] the transverse-traceless field is (HhH \u2217 )\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n4\n\n(3)\n\n\fWe will present later a non-minimal action satisfying this requirement. It will turn out\nto have a canonical kinetic term A\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = \u03b3 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 . Before entering into the details of its\nconstruction, it is instructive to see why constraint (3) ensures at once that the equations\nof motion derived from Lagrangian (1) define a hyperbolic system that propagates causally\nfour degrees of freedom.\nWhen A\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = \u03b3 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 , the equations of motion are\nR\u03bc + B \u03bc\u03bd \u03c8\u03bd = 0,\n\nR\u03bc \u2261 \u03b3 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 D\u03bd \u03c8\u03c1 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhile their gamma-trace is\n2\u03b3 \u03bc\u03bd D\u03bc \u03c8\u03bd + .... = 0\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the ellipsis stand for \"mass\" terms containing no derivatives. Using the identity\n\u03b3 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = \u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 \u03bd\u03c1 \u2212 \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd \u03b3 \u03c1 + \u03b7 \u03bc\u03c1 \u03b3 \u03bd ,\n\n(6)\n\neq. (5) and the constraint (3), one can reduce equations of motion (4) to a standard,\nmanifestly causal Dirac form:\nD\u03c8\n/ \u03bc + non-derivative terms = 0.\n\n(7)\n\nSince B \u03bc\u03bd is antisymmetric in \u03bc, \u03bd, the 0-th component of the equations of motion, R0 = 0\ncontains neither time derivatives nor \u03c80 ; thus, it enforces four constraints among the\nremaining fields \u03c8i , i = 1, 2, 3. Constraint (3) then removes \u03c80 = \u03b3 0 \u03b3 i \u03c8i leaving 3\u00d74\u22124 =\n8 physical variables i.e. four degrees of freedom (four coordinates and four conjugate\nmomenta). A completely analogous way to prove the same result uses the obvious fact\nthat consistent propagation of the constraint (3) and eq. (7) imply D \u03bc \u03c8\u03bc = non-derivative\nterms; so, using eq. (7) to write D0 \u03c80 = \u03b3 0 \u03b3 i Di \u03c80 + non-derivative terms, one gets from\nthe above divergence the four additional constraints needed to reduce the number of\ndegrees of freedom to four.\n\nConstruction of the Non-Minimal Action\nOf course, the real question is whether a non-minimal action that gives eq. (3) exists. We\nprove that it does by explicitly constructing one.\nOur ansatz for the non-minimal \"Pauli\" terms is\nA\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 ,\n\n(8)\n\n\u03c1\nB\u03bc\u03bd = m\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd + G+\n\u03bc\u03bd + \u03b3 T\u03c1[\u03bc \u03b3\u03bd] ,\n\u03c1\u03c3\n1\nG+\n\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 G\u03bc\u03bd + 2 \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 G\n\n5\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\n\fThe Lorentz tensor G\u03bc\u03bd is antisymmetric (G\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212G\u03bd\u03bc ) and O(F ), while the Lorentz\ntensor T\u03bc\u03bd is symmetric and traceless (T\u03bc\u03bd = T\u03bd\u03bc , T\u03bc\u03bc = 0) and O(F 2 ). Hermiticity of\nLagrangian (1) implies that T\u03bc\u03bd is real and G\u03bc\u03bd is imaginary. Apart from these constraints,\nthey are as-yet unspecified functions of the electromagnetic field strength F\u03bc\u03bd .\nAs pointed out in ref [12], addition of G+\n\u03bc\u03bd alone can never yield a causal theory,\nirrespective of its functional dependence on F\u03bc\u03bd . It is crucial to notice that the term\nproportional to T\u03bc\u03bd instead, is structurally different from all those studied in [12] 9 .\nA few identities that will be crucial for our construction and follow from elementary\nmanipulations of gamma-matrix algebra are (6) and\n\u03b3 \u03bc G+\n\u03bc\u03bd =\nG+\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n=\n\n\u03b3 \u03c1 D[\u03c1 \u03c8\u03bc] =\n\n1\n\u03b3 * G\u03b3\u03bd ,\n\u03b3*\n2\n\u03c1\n\u2212 41 \u03b3 \u03b3 * G\u03b3\u03c1\u03bc\u03bd\n1\nR \u2212 14 \u03b3\u03bc \u03b3 \u03c1 R\u03c1 ,\n2 \u03bc\n\nG \u2261 \u03b3\u03c1\u03c3 G\u03c1\u03c3 ,\n\u03b3 \u03bc\u03bd D\u03bc \u03c8\u03bd = 21 \u03b3 \u03c1 R\u03c1 .\n\n(11)\n(12)\n(13)\n\nEither direct calculation or simple considerations of representation theory of the Lorentz\ngroup lead to another important identity 10\nG\u03bc\u03c1 G\u0303\u03c1\u03bd = \u2212 14 \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd G\u03c1\u03c3 G\u0303\u03c1\u03c3 .\n\n(14)\n\nThanks to these identities, the gamma-trace of the equations of motion (4) is\n2\u03b3 \u03bc\u03bd D\u03bc \u03c8\u03bd + T \u03bc\u03bd \u03b3\u03bc \u03c8\u03bd = [\u22123m + O(F )] \u03b3 * \u03c8.\n\n(15)\n\nThe term multiplying \u03b3 *\u03c8 \u2261 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8\u03bc on the right-hand side of this equation is a 4\u00d74 matrix\ncontaining no derivatives, thus built only out of gamma matrices, G\u03bc\u03bd , and T\u03bc\u03bd . The split\ninto the constant term \u22123m and higher powers of the electromagnetic field follows simply\nfrom our ansatz, G\u03bc\u03bd = O(F ), T\u03bc\u03bd = O(F 2 ).\nNext we take the divergence of equations of motion (4). Since the covariant derivative\nD\u03bc obeys [D\u03bc , D\u03bd ] = ieF\u03bc\u03bd we have\nD\u03bc R\u03bc = \u2212ieF \u03bc\u03bd \u03b3\u03bc \u03c8\u03bd +\n9\n\nie\n\u03b3 * F \u03b3 * \u03c8.\n2\n\n(16)\n\nAppendix B of [12] proves that non-minimal terms of the generic form B\u03bc\u03bd = iW\u03bc\u03bd + \u03b3 5 X\u03bc\u03bd + \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd Y +\ni\u03b3 5 \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd Z still allow for superluminal propagation, even when the coefficients W, X, Y, Z are arbitrary\nfunctions of F\u03bc\u03bd . To the best of our knowledge, the last term in our eq. (9) has never been considered\nbefore.\n10\nG\u03bc\u03bd decomposes into irreps of SL(2, C) as (1, 0) + (0, 1) while G\u0303\u03bc\u03bd decomposes as (1, 0) \u2212 (0, 1).\nThe most general tensor product of the two decomposes as (2, 0) + (1, 0) + (0, 1) + (0, 0), but since its\nantisymmetric part vanishes on self-dual or anti self-dual backgrounds, it cannot contain either (1, 0) or\n(0, 1). On the other hand, the same tensor product can only contain representations appearing in the\ntensor product ( 12 , 21 ) \u00d7 ( 12 , 12 ) = (1, 1) + (1, 0) + (0, 1) + (0, 0). The only common element is (0, 0).\n\n6\n\n\fBy using eq.

The first is\nthat the left-hand side of eq. (18) must either vanish or be proportional to O(F )\u03b3 * \u03c8; the\nsecond is that the matrix [ 23 m2 + O(F ) ] is invertible.\nThe hard one is the first.\nTo satisfy it, we first of all set\n\u0001\nT\u03bc\u03bd = A G\u03bc\u03c1 G\u03c1\u03bd \u2212 14 G\u03c3\u03c1 G\u03c1\u03c3 \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere A is a constant. This choice renders the term T\u03bc\u03c1 T\u03c1\u03bd = O(F 4 )\u03b3 * \u03c8 and also makes\nthe term inside the first parenthesis in eq. (18) antisymmetric in \u03bc, \u03bd. Both properties\nfollow from eq. (14), which gives the identities (Tr H \u2261 H\u03bc\u03bc )\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2212 \u03c1\u03bd\n+ \u03c1\u03bd\nG+\n= G\u2212\n= 2 G\u03bc\u03c1 G\u03c1\u03bd \u2212 41 Tr (G2 )\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03c1 G\n\u03bc\u03c1 G\n\n\u00b1 \u03c1\u03bd\nG\u00b1\n=\n\u03bc\u03c1 G\n\n1\n[ Tr (G2 )\n2\n\n\u00b1 i\u03b3 5 Tr (GG\u0303) ] \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(20)\n(21)\n\nNow the two terms in parentheses in eq. (18) must separately either vanish or be proportional to \u03b3 * \u03c8, since the first is antisymmetric in \u03bc, \u03bd while the second is symmetric.\nThe choice A = \u2212m\u22121 makes the whole symmetric term in (18) equal to O(F 2 )\u03b3 * \u03c8.\nOn the other hand, the antisymmetric term vanishes if G\u03bc\u03bd satisfies the following implicit\nequation:\n1\n1\nie\n2\nTr\n(G\n)G\n\u2212\nTr (GG\u0303)G\u0303\u03bc\u03bd .\n(22)\nG\u03bc\u03bd = + F\u03bc\u03bd +\n\u03bc\u03bd\nm\n4m2\n4m2\nThis can be solved by power series as long as the relativistic field invariants F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd ,\nF\u03bc\u03bd F\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd have magnitudes that are small compared to m4 /e2 12 . This is the crucial feature\nwe need, namely a theory that only breaks down for large invariants, but that is wellbehaved when they are small, even when some field strength component becomes O(m2 /e).\n11\n\nThe first is a standard gamma-matrix identity, while the second follows from tracelessness of T\u03bc\u03bd .\n(Semi)-explicitly, G\u03bc\u03bd = aF\u03bc\u03bd + bF\u0303\u03bc\u03bd , with a, b analytic functions of the relativistic field invariants.\nThey obey a = ie/m + O[Tr (F 2 ), Tr (F F\u0303 )], b = O[Tr (F 2 ), Tr (F F\u0303 )] for |Tr (F 2 )|, |Tr (F F\u0303 )| \u226a m4 /e2 .\n12\n\n7\n\n\fEqs. (19,22) make the constraint (18) take the desired form\n\u0003\n2\nm\n+\nO(F\n)\n\u03b3 * \u03c8 = 0.\n2\n\n\u00023\n\n(23)\n\nThe proportionality matrix multiplying \u03b3 * \u03c8 contains only gamma matrices and powers of\n(e/m2 )F\u03bc\u03bd with dimensionless coefficients; therefore, Lorentz invariance implies that its\ndeterminant can only be a function of relativistic field invariants, hence invertible when\n|F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd |, |F\u03bc\u03bd F\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd | \u226a m4 /e2 . So the second condition is met precisely when an effective\nLagrangian description is supposed to make sense.\nThe redefinition G\u03bc\u03bd = imX\u03bc\u03bd and a straightforward computation give the explicit\nform of the matrix; the constraint equation then becomes\no\nn\n(24)\n48 \u2212 [Tr (X 2 )]2 \u2212 [Tr (X X\u0303)]2 \u03b3 * \u03c8 = 0,\nwhich manifestly depends only on relativistic field invariants.\n\nSummary\nThe construction presented in this paper answers a question that in various guises remained unanswered for many decades, namely: does a consistent, causal Lagrangian\ndescribing a single massive, charged particle of spin larger than one in interaction with\nthe electromagnetic field exist?\nThe answer for spin 3/2 is yes, at least for constant external fields. This is a major\nachievement in itself, since constant fields are exactly those that cause the Velo-Zwanziger\nacausality [4] and the Johnson-Sudarshan problem [7].\nThe crucial property of our construction is that the standard gamma-tracelessness\nconstraint \u03b3 * \u03c8 = 0 is enforced exactly. Enforcing it only up to a finite order in an\nexpansion in powers of the field strength would not suffice. To see this, we may try to\nsubstitute G\u03bc\u03bd = i(e/m)F\u03bc\u03bd , T\u03bc\u03bd = 0 in our non-minimal ansatz eq. (9). This choice\nsatisfies constraint (3) up to O(F 2 ):\n\u0003\ne2 \u03bc\n2\n\u03b3 F\u03bc\u03c1 F \u03c1\u03bd \u03c8\u03bd .\nm\n+\nO(F\n)\n\u03b3\n*\n\u03c8\n=\n2\nm2\n\n\u00023\n\n(25)\n\nAs shown in [12], superluminal propagation of signals occurs when \u03c80 6= 0, \u03c8i = 0 solve\nthis equation. Contrary to, say, constraint eq. (24), eq. (25) depends on quantities, such\nas the electromagnetic stress energy tensor, that can be large even when the relativistic\nfield invariants are small. This property allows \u03c80 6= 0, \u03c8i = 0 to be a solution even when\n|Tr (F 2 )|, |Tr (F F\u0303 )| \u226a m4 /e2 , as it can be easily proven by direct computation [12].\nIt is also illuminating that the solution involves no extra degrees of freedom and that\ncarefully chosen parity-preserving non-minimal terms suffice. It is an amusing and perhaps\n8\n\n\fdeep fact that the non-minimal couplings also give a gyromagnetic factor g = 2 \u2212 the\nsame value needed to improve the high-energy behavior of \"Compton\" forward scattering\namplitudes, and the one given by open string theory [20].\nIt is finally worth noticing that the non-minimal terms required by causality in our\nadmittedly non-unique Lagrangian lower the intrinsic UV cutoff of the theory, from its\ntheoretical maximum \u039b \u223c e\u22121/2 m [21], to \u039b \u223c e\u22121/3 m. If this property were to extend\nto the most general causal Lagrangian of charged spin 3/2 fields it would offer a powerful\ntool to establish stronger, model independent limits on the UV cutoff of such theories.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank A.
