It would also provide the information needed to determine neutrino masses, complementary to the one obtained from solar and\natmospheric neutrino experiments [3, 4].\nTheoretical nuclear matrix elements are needed to convert experimental\nhalf-life limits, which are available for many \u03b2\u03b2-unstable isotopes [2, 5], into\nconstrains for the effective Majorana mass of the neutrino and the contribution of right-handed currents to the weak interactions. Thus, these matrix\nelements are essential to understand the underlying physics [6, 7, 8]. The\ntwo neutrino mode of the double beta decay (\u03b2\u03b22\u03bd ) is allowed as a second\norder process in the standard model. It has been detected in ten nuclei [5]\nand it has served to test a variety of nuclear models [2].\nThe pseudo SU(3) approach has been used to describe many low-lying\nrotational bands, as well as B(E2) and B(M1) intensities, in rare earth and\nactinide nuclei, both with even-even and odd-mass numbers. The theoretical\nresults show, in general, a very good agreement with the data [9]. The \u03b2\u03b2\nhalf-lives of some heavy deformed nuclei, which may decay to the ground and\nexcited states of the daughters, were evaluated for the two and zero neutrino\nemitting modes [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] using the pseudo SU(3) scheme. The\npredictions were in good agreement with the available experimental data for\n150\nNd and 238 U. The double electron capture decay channel was studied for\nthe decay of other three nuclei [15].\nThe simplest pseudo SU(3) model predicts the complete suppression of\nthe \u03b2\u03b22\u03bd decay for the following five nuclei: 154 Sm, 160 Gd, 176 Yb, 232 Th and\n244\nPu [10, 14]. Recently, it was argued that the cancellation of the \u03b2\u03b22\u03bd decay\nin 160 Gd would suppress the background for the detection of the 0\u03bd mode\n[16].\nIn the present contribution we extend the previous research [10, 11, 12,\n13, 14, 17] and evaluate the \u03b2\u03b2 half-lives of 154 Sm, 160 Gd, 170 Er, 176 Yb, 232 Th\nand 244 Pu using the pseudo SU(3) model. In these nuclei the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 mode is\nforbidden when the most probable occupations are considered. To be able to\nevaluate finite half-lives, we were forced to include in the calculations states\nwith different occupation numbers which can be mixed through the pairing\ninteraction. The amount of this mixing is evaluated, and the possibility of\nobserving the \u03b2\u03b2 decay is discussed for both the 2\u03bd and 0\u03bd modes.\nPseudo-spin symmetry [18] describes the quasi-degeneracy of the singleparticle orbitals with j = l \u2212 1/2 and j = (l \u2212 2) + 1/2 in the \u03b7 shell. It\nallows these orbitals to be classified as pseudo-spin partners with quantum\nnumbers j\u0303 = j, \u03b7\u0303 = \u03b7 \u2212 1 and  \u0303l = l \u2212 1.

The deformations [19] and occupancies for the 12 isotopes\nstudied in the present work are shown in Table 1.\nIn the \u03b2\u03b22\u03bd decay each Gamow-Teller operator annihilates a proton and\ncreates a neutron in the same oscillator shell and with the same orbital\nangular momentum. As a consequence, the \u03b2\u03b22\u03bd decay is allowed only if the\noccupation numbers fulfill the following relationships\nA\nnA\np,f = np,i + 2 ,\n\nA\nnA\nn,f = nn,i ,\n\nN\nN\nN\nnN\np,f = np,i , nn,f = nn,i \u2212 2 .\n\n(1)\n\nThis selection rule [10] forbids the \u03b2\u03b22\u03bd decay between the nuclei marked\n3\n\n\fwith (1) or without comments in Table 1. However, the pairing interaction\nallows the mixing between states in the same nuclei with pairs of nucleons\ntransferred between different configurations. These excited configurations are\nindicated by (2) in Table 1. An energy difference \u2206E is required to promote\na pair of nucleons from the last occupied normal parity orbital to the next\nintruder orbital (or viceversa), in the deformed single particle Nilsson scheme.\nIt is listed in the seventh column of Table 1.\nThe \"leading SU(3) irreps\", those which are the most bounded under\nthe quadrupole - quadrupole interaction, are the dominant component of the\nground state wave function in these heavy deformed nuclei, representing in\nmost cases more than 60% of the total wave function [9]. For the eight rare\nearth isotopes listed in Table 1, this dominant wave function component can\nbe written as\nA\n\nA\n\n|Nucleus, 0+ i = | (h11/2 )np , JpA = 0; (i13/2 )nn , JnA = 0iA\n|{2\n\nnN\np\n2\n\n}(\u03bbp , \u03bcp ); {2\n\nnN\nn\n2\n\n(2)\n\n}(\u03bbn , \u03bcn ); 1(\u03bb, \u03bc)K = 1, J = 0iN .\nA\n\nA\n\nFor the actinide isotopes, the intruder sector is | (i13/2 )np , JpA = 0; (j15/2 )nn , JnA =\n0i.\nThe proton, neutron, and total SU(3) irreps associated to each set of\noccupation numbers are listed in Table 2.\nAs a first approximation, we will describe the ground state of each nucleus\nas a linear combination of these two states:\n|Nucleus, 0+ i = x1 |Nucleus(1), 0+ i + x2 |Nucleus(2), 0+ i,\nwith x21 + x22 = 1.\nMany multipole-multipole pairing type interactions can remove a pair of\nnucleons from an unique parity orbital and create another pair in a normal\nparity one. In the present approach we are restricting the pairs of nucleons in\nintruder orbits to be coupled to J=0, i.e. to have seniority zero.

In the case of 244 Pu we are using a small deformation\n[19], for which the two configurations listed in Table 1 are nearly degenerate,\nand have maximal mixing. It has important consequences upon its predicted\n\u03b2\u03b2 half-life.\nThe inverse half-life of the two neutrino mode of the \u03b2\u03b2-decay, \u03b2\u03b22\u03bd , can\nbe evaluated as [20]\nh\n\n1/2\n\n\u03c42\u03bd (0+ \u2192 0+ )\n\ni\u22121\n\n= G2\u03bd | M2\u03bd |2 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere G2\u03bd is a kinematical factor which depends on Q\u03b2\u03b2 , the total kinetic\nenergy available in the decay.\nThe nuclear matrix element is\nGT\nM2\u03bd \u2248 M2\u03bd\n=\n\nX\nN\n\n+\n+\n+\nh0+\nf || \u0393 || 1N i h1N || \u0393 || 0i i\n,\nEf + EN \u2212 Ei\n\n(5)\n\nbeing \u0393 the Gamow-Teller operator. The energy denominator contains the\nintermediate EN , initial Ei and final Ef energies. The kets |1+\nN i denote\nintermediate states.\nThe mathematical expressions needed to evaluate the nuclear matrix elements of the allowed g.s. \u2192 g.s. \u03b2\u03b2 decay in the pseudo SU(3) model were\ndeveloped in [10]. Using the summation method described in [10], exploiting\n \u0303 Hamiltonian commutes with\nthe fact that the two body terms of the SU(3)\nthe Gamow-Teller operator [11], resuming the infinite series and recoupling\nthe Gamow-Teller operators, the following expression was found:\nGT\nM2\u03bd\n=\n\niJ=0\n\u03c3(p, n)2 + h \u2020\nh0f | [ap \u2297 \u00e3n ]1 \u2297 [a\u2020p \u2297 \u00e3n ]1\n|0+\ni i,\nE\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c3(p, n) are the 1-body Gamow-Teller matrix elements and the energy\ndenominator E is determined by demanding that the excitation energy of the\nIsobaric Analog State equals the difference in Coulomb energies [10, 17]. The\nindex p, n refer to the orbitals ip11/2 , in13/2 for 154 Sm, 160 Gd, 170 Er, and 176 Yb,\np\nn\n, j15/2\nand to the orbitals j13/2\nfor 232 Th and 244 Pu.\nAs it was discussed in [10] Eq. (6) has no free parameters, being the\ndenominator E a well defined quantity. The reduction to only one term\ncomes as a consequence of the restricted proton and neutron spaces of the\nmodel. The initial and final ground states are strongly correlated with a very\nrich structure in terms of their shell model components. The evaluation of\n6\n\n\fthe matrix elements in the normal space of Eq. (6) is performed by using\nSU(3) Racah calculus to decouple the proton and neutron normal irreps, and\nexpanding the annihilation operators in their SU(3) tensorial components.\nFor the six potential \u03b2\u03b2 emitters listed in Tables I and II, the \u03b2\u03b22\u03bd decay\ncan only proceed through the second component of the ground state wave\nfunction, and for this reason it is proportional to the amplitude x2 . Its\nexplicit expression is given in [17].\nFor massive Majorana neutrinos one can perform the integration over the\nfour-momentum of the exchanged particle and obtain a neutrino potential,\nwhich for a light neutrino (m\u03bd < 10 MeV) has the form\n2R\nH(r, E) =\npr\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndq\n\n0\n\nsin(qr)\n,\nq+E\n\n(7)\n\nwhere E is the average excitation energy of the intermediate odd-odd nucleus\nand the nuclear radius R has been added to make the neutrino potential\ndimensionless. In the zero neutrino case this closure approximation is well\njustified [21]. The final formula, restricted to the term proportional to the\nneutrino mass, is [22, 20]\n1/2\n(\u03c40\u03bd )\u22121\n\n=\n\nhm\u03bd i\nme\n\n!2\n\n2\nG0\u03bd M0\u03bd\n,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere G0\u03bd is the phase space integral associated with the emission of the two\nelectrons.

In the present work we use the effective value ( ggVA )2 = 1.0 [6].\nTransforming this operator to the pseudo SU(3) space, we arrive to the\nexpression\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nO \u03b1 = ON\n+ ON\n+ OA\u03b1 p Nn + OA\u03b1 p An ,\n(11)\np Nn\np An\nwhere the subscript index NN, NA, . . . are indicating the normal or abnormal spaces of the fermion creation and annihilation operators, respectively.\nIn previous works [10, 11] we restricted our analysis to six potential double beta emitters which, within the approximations of the simplest pseudo\nSU(3) scheme, were also decaying via the 2\u03bd mode. They included the observed 150 Nd \u2192 150 Sm and 238 U \u2192 238 Pu decays. In these cases two neutrons\nbelonging to a normal parity orbital decay in two protons belonging to an\nabnormal parity one. The transition is mediated by the operator OA\u03b1 p Nn .\nIn Table 3 the \u03b2\u03b22\u03bd decays of the six nuclei, previously reported as forbidden, are presented. Those with the larger Q\u03b2\u03b2 values have the larger\nGT\nphase-space integrals G2\u03bd . The \u03b2\u03b22\u03bd -decay matrix elements M2\u03bd\nare suppressed by a factor x2 \u2248 1/3 compared with the \"allowed\" ones (see [10]),\nwhich reflects in \u03b2\u03b22\u03bd half-lives a factor 10 larger than in other nuclei with\nsimilar Q-values. The exception is 244 Pu, which for the deformation used has\na large mixing, and the shorter \u03b2\u03b22\u03bd half-life, which is not far from the limits\nreported in the Livermore experiment [23]. The decay of 160 Gd is suppressed\nbut it is still not far from the present limits [24], and large enough to be seen\nin the proposed experiments [16].\nThose configurations in which the \u03b2\u03b22\u03bd transitions are forbidden can still\nbe connected through the zero neutrino mode, due to presence of the neutrino\n8\n\n\fNucleus\n154\nSm\n160\nGd\n170\nEr\n176\nYb\n232\nTh\n244\nPu\n\nG0\u03bd [yr\u22121 ]\n4.898 10\u221215\n1.480 10\u221214\n1.673 10\u221215\n6.817 10\u221215\n3.160 10\u221214\n1.463 10\u221213\n\n1/2\n\nM0\u03bd \u03c40\u03bd\n2.384\n0.919\n0.731\n0.772\n1.232\n1.171\n\nhm\u03bd i2 [yr eV2 ]\n9.38 1024\n2.09 1025\n2.92 1026\n6.43 1025\n5.44 1024\n1.30 1024\n\nTable 4: The phase-space integrals, matrix elements and predicted half-lives\nfor the 0\u03bd double beta decay\npotential. In this way there are two terms in the \u03b2\u03b20\u03bd decay: one connecting\nto the basis state which has allowed \u03b2\u03b22\u03bd decay, and one to the state with\nforbidden \u03b2\u03b22\u03bd decay. The equations needed in the first case are the same\nemployed in the study of allowed decays [10, 11]. The second one involves\nthe annihilation of two neutrons in normal parity orbitals, and the creation\nof two protons in normal parity orbitals (intruder-intruder in 154 Sm). The\n\u03b1\n(OA\u03b1 p An ). A detailed description\ntransition is mediated by the operator ON\np Nn\nof the calculations involved is presented in [17]. \u03b2\u03b20\u03bd phase-space integrals,\nnuclear matrix elements and half-lives are shown in Table 4.\nAs a consequence of the explicit inclusion of deformation in the present\nmodel, the \u03b2\u03b20\u03bd half-lives are larger than those reported in [25]. In 160 Gd the\n\u03b2\u03b20\u03bd -decay half-life is at least three orders of magnitude larger than the\n\u03b2\u03b22\u03bd -decay half-life. It implies that the background suppression due to a\nlarge \u03b2\u03b22\u03bd half-life would be effective, although not as noticeably as was\noptimistically envisioned in [16]. In any case, the results presented strongly\nsuggest that the planned experiments using GSO crystals [16] would be able\nto detect the \u03b2\u03b22\u03bd decay of 160 Gd, and to establish competitive limits to the\n\u03b2\u03b20\u03bd decay.\nThe present results consider only the dominant pseudo SU(3) irrep for\neach configuration. We have learned from realistic calculations, where the\nsingle particle term and pairing interactions induce the mixing of different\nirreps, that the leading irreps represent in most even-even heavy deformed\nnuclei at least 60 % of the total wave function [9]. The inclusion of spin dependent terms in the Hamiltonian, relevant to the description of the GamowTeller resonance, is not expected to strongly modify the ground state wave\nfunction of the even-even initial and final nuclei. This dominance lead us\n9\n\n\fto expect that future calculations, which will take into account contributions from various irreps, would slightly affect the present predictions. Given\nthe leading role play by the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction in heavy deformed nucleus, we are confident that the order of magnitude of the predicted\n\u03b2\u03b2 half-lives, when various irreps are included in the calculations, will remain\nunchanged, as compared to the results reported above.\nWork supported in part by CONACyT, and by a CONACyT-CONICET\nagreement under the project Algebraic methods in nuclear and subnuclear\nphysics.
