The covariant generalization of Moyal theory, also\nknown as Vey quantum mechanics, was presented in the literature many years ago.

In this paper we present a covariant\ngeneralization of the Weyl order prescription and of the Weyl-Wigner map and use them to\nderive Vey quantum mechanics directly from the standard operator formulation. The procedure displays some interesting features: it yields all the key ingredients and provides a more\nstraightforward interpretation of the Vey theory including a direct implementation of unitary\noperator transformations as phase space coordinate transformations in the Vey idiom. These\nfeatures are illustrated through a simple example.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Weyl-Wigner map [1, 2] yields the Moyal formulation of quantum mechanics, [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nalternative to the more conventional standard operator [9, 10, 11, 12] and path integral formulations.\nThe main features of Moyal quantum mechanics are that it is formulated in terms of phase space\nfunctions and dynamics is based on a deformation of the Poisson bracket, named Moyal bracket\n[3, 13, 14, 15]. This formulation of quantum mechanics has been receiving increased attention namely\nin the context of the fields of the semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics [5, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19],\nquantum chaos [20, 21], hybrid dynamics [22, 23] and also in M-theory [24, 25].\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nmop48451@mail.telepac.pt\nmat@ulusofona.pt\n\n1\n\n\fThe Weyl-Wigner isomorphism between operators and phase space functions (symbols) provides\nthe entire structure of Moyal quantum mechanics directly from the standard operator formulation.\nLet us choose a set of fundamental operators (q\u0302i , p\u0302i ) and the corresponding set of canonical variables\n(qi , pi ), i = 1..N for an arbitrary N dimensional dynamical system. The Weyl-Wigner map W(q,p) :\n\u00c2 \u2192 A(T \u2217M) attributes to a given operator \u00c2 in the quantum algebra \u00c2 a unique element of the\nalgebra of functions over the phase space T \u2217 M:\nW(q,p) (\u00c2) =\n\nZ\n\nh\u0304\nh\u0304\ndN ~y e\u2212i~p*~y < ~q \u2212 ~y |\u00c2|~q + ~y >,\n2\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere we used the compact notation:\n~y \u2261 (y1 , * * * , yN );\n\ndN ~y \u2261 dy1 * * * dyN ;\n\np~ \u2261 (p1 , * * * , pN ) ~q \u2261 (q1 , * * * , qN ),\n\nand the subscript (q, p) means that the corresponding object (the Weyl-Wigner map in this case)\nis defined in the variables (~q, ~p). This specification seems redundant now but is important for the\nsequel. The Weyl-Wigner\nmap is bijective and univocous. Moreover, it is an isomorphism between\n\u0010\n\u0011\nthe quantum \u00c2, *, [, ] and the \"classical\" (A, \u2217, [, ]M ) algebras. The quantum algebra \u00c2 is based on\nthe operator product * and the quantum commutator [, ], whereas the classical algebraic structures\nare the \"star\" product \u2217 and the Moyal bracket [, ]M . The Weyl-Wigner map is a morphism in the\nsense that:\nW(q,p) (\u00c2 * B\u0302)\n= W(q,p) (\u00c2) \u2217(q,p) W(q,p) (B\u0302),\n(2)\n\u0010h\ni\u0011\nh\ni\nW(q,p) \u00c2, B\u0302\n= W(q,p) (\u00c2), W(q,p) (B\u0302)\n,\n\u2200\u00c2,B\u0302\u2208\u00c2 ,\nM(q,p)\n\nand it yields the functional structure of the star product and Moyal bracket:\nA \u2217(q,p) B = Ae\n\nih\u0304 \u02c6\nJ\n2 (q,p)\n\nB,\n\n[A, B]M(q,p)\n\n!\n\nh\u0304 \u02c6\n2\nJ(q,p) B,\n= A sin\nh\u0304\n2\n\nP\nwhere J\u02c6(q,p) is the \"Poisson\" operator: J\u02c6(q,p) \u2261 N\ni=1\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2190\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2202 \u2202\n\u2202qi \u2202pi\n\n\u2190\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2202 \u2202\n\u2202pi \u2202qi\n\nA, B \u2208 A\n\n(3)\n\u2190\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2192\n\n, the derivatives \u2202 and \u2202\n\u2190\n\n\u2192\n\nkl\n\u2202 l , where\nacting on A and B, respectively. Alternatively, J\u02c6(q,p) can be written as: J\u02c6(q,p) = \u2202 k J(q,p)\nkl\nJ(q,p) is the kl-th element of the symplectic matrix in the variables (~q, ~p):\n\nJ(q,p) =\n\n0N \u00d7N \u22121N \u00d7N\n1N \u00d7N\n0N \u00d7N\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(4)\n\nWe introduced the compact notation: O k = pk , k = 1, * * * , N; O k = qk\u2212N , k = N + 1, * * * , 2N;\n\u2202/\u2202Ok = \u2202k and sum over repeated indices is understood.\nFrom eq.(3) it is trivial to obtain the following expansion in powers of h\u0304:\n1\nih\u0304 \u2190 kl \u2192\n\u2202 lB +\nA \u2217(q,p) B = A * B + A \u2202 k J(q,p)\n2\n2\n\nih\u0304\n2\n\n!2\n\n\u2190 \u2190\n\n\u2192\u2192\n\nkl\nsn\n\u2202 l \u2202 nB + * * *\nA \u2202 k \u2202 s J(q,p)\nJ(q,p)\n\n(5)\n\nThe Weyl-Wigner transform of the density matrix operator is the Wigner distribution function\n[2], fW (~q, p~; t) = W(q,p) (|\u03c8(t) >< \u03c8(t)|), which is the fundamental mathematical object of Moyal\nquantum mechanics. Its time evolution is given by the dynamical equation:\nf \u0307W (~q, ~p; t) = [H(~q, ~p), fW (~q, p~; t)],\n2\n\nH = W(q,p) (\u0124),\n\n(6)\n\n\fwhere \u0124 is the quantum Hamiltonian. We see that the mathematical structure of Moyal quantum\nmechanics is very similar to that of classical statistical mechanics. However, these similarities should\nnot be taken too seriously. The procedure by which physical relevant information is obtained is a lot\nmore elaborate. In classical statistical mechanics the fundamental predictions are the probabilities\nfor finding the system in an arbitrary configuration (~q0 , ~p0 ), which are given by the values of a true\nprobability distribution function \u03c1(~q = ~q0 , p~ = p~0 ).\nOn the contrary, in Moyal quantum mechanics the value of fW (~q = ~q0 , p~ = p~0 ) cannot be given\nsuch straightforward interpretation, given the fact that fW (~q, ~p) might take on negative values. The\nfundamental physical predictions of Moyal quantum mechanics are obtained through a procedure\nanalogous to that of standard operator quantum mechanics. Given a general observable A(~q, p~) we\nshould solve the star-genvalue equation [8, 26]:\nA(~q, ~p) \u2217(q,p) gan (~q, ~p) = agan (~q, ~p),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere n is a degeneracy index, to obtain the probability for a measurement of A at the time t\nyielding the value a:\nP (A(~q, p~; t) = a) =\n\nXZ\n\ndN ~q\n\nn\n\nZ\n\ndN p~gan (~q, p~)fW (~q, p~; t),\n\n(8)\n\nwhere we assumed that the degeneracy index is discrete. If this is not the case then the sum in n is\nreplaced by a (set of) integral(s) in n. For the fundamental observables qi and pi , i = 1..N, eq.(8)\nreduces to a more \"classical like\" result:\nP (qi (t) = q0 ) =\n\nZ\n\ndN ~q\n\nZ\n\ndN p~fW (~q, ~p; t)\u03b4(qi \u2212q0 );\n\nP (pi (t) = p0 ) =\n\nZ\n\ndN ~q\n\nZ\n\ndN p~fW (~q, p~; t)\u03b4(pi \u2212p0 ),\n(9)\n\nthe same happening to the average value of A(~q, p~):\n< A(~q, p~; t) >=\n\nZ\n\nN\n\nd ~q\n\nZ\n\ndN p~A(~q, p~)fW (~q, ~p; t).\n\n(10)\n\nAn important subject in any dynamical theory is the study of its invariances. Just like standard operator quantum mechanics the Moyal formulation is invariant under the action of general\nunitary transformations and contrary to what happens in classical mechanics is not invariant under the action of a significative set of coordinate transformations. In fact, most unitary operator\ntransformations are not implemented as phase space coordinate transformations in the Moyal idiom.\nMany years ago Vey [27] presented a generalization of the star product that renders Moyal\nquantum mechanics fully invariant under phase space coordinate transformations. The original\nmotivation was not to enlarge the invariance properties of Moyal quantum mechanics, but to derive the general form of the Poisson algebra deformations for curved phase spaces. Vey's original\ndevelopments have been used in investigations aiming at two major directions. Firstly, in more\nmathematically oriented research, to generalize the Moyal-Weyl-Wigner quantization procedure to\nnon-flat phase space manifolds [14, 15, 28, 29]. Secondly, to provide a consistent classical interpretation of Moyal dynamics [14, 15].\nTo our knowledge however, a complete study of the relation between Vey covariant quantum\nmechanics and standard operator quantum mechanics casting Vey theory at the same level of\ncompleteness as Moyal quantum mechanics has not yet been presented. Take for instance the\n3\n\n\fWeyl-Wigner map. Although trivial, the covariant generalization of this map is still missing in the\nliterature.\nIn this paper we emphasize the relation between standard operator quantum mechanics and\nMoyal quantum mechanics and attempt to derive the Vey formulation in a similar fashion. There\nare two main virtues in this approach: firstly it clarifies the relation between the standard operator\nand Vey quantum mechanics (providing, for instance a new point of view for the analysis of the\ninvariance properties of covariant phase space quantum mechanics). Secondly it yields a (previously\nmissing) covariant generalization of some key ingredients of phase space quantum mechanics, such\nas the Weyl-Wigner map, the Weyl order prescription, the average and the marginal probability\ndistribution functionals and the star-genvalue equation.\nThis paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we start by reviewing some well known properties\nconcerning the action of canonical and coordinate transformations in the Moyal formalism. We\nthen present (section 3) a covariant generalization of the Weyl-Wigner map. The new map makes\nit possible to implement a general unitary transformation of standard operator quantum mechanics\nas a coordinate transformation in the Moyal idiom. In section 4 we use the new map to derive the\ncovariant star product and, as a by-product, the dynamical structure of Vey quantum mechanics.\nIn section 5 we present a summary of the structure of covariant quantum mechanics, including the\ngeneralizations of the star-genvalue equation, the average value and the probability functionals.\nFinally, in section 6 some of the features of the formalism are illustrated through a simple example.\nBefore proceeding let us make an important remark: from the outset we shall restrict our\nattention to the simpler case of dynamical systems displaying a phase space with the structure of\na flat manifold.\n\n2\n\nCanonical and coordinate transformations\n\nIn classical mechanics all canonical transformations are phase space coordinate transformations.\nTheir action is of the form (we shall take the passive point of view):\n~ P~ ), p~ = p~(Q,\n~ P~ )),\nT : T \u2217 M \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M; (~q, p~) \u2212\u2192 (~q = ~q(Q,\n\n(11)\n\n~ P~ ) and (~q, ~p) are two sets of canonical variables. T yields a transformation of a general\nwhere (Q,\nobservable given by:\n~ P~ ) = A(~q(Q,\n~ P~ ), p~(Q,\n~ P~ )),\nT : A(~q, ~p) \u2212\u2192 A\u2032 (Q,\n(12)\n~ P~ ) = T {A(~q, ~p)} and B \u2032 (Q,\n~ P~ ) = T {B(~q, p~)} we have:\nand for two general observables A\u2032 (Q,\n~ P~ ), p~(Q,\n~ P~ )), B(~q(Q,\n~ P~ ), ~p(Q,\n~ P~ ))}(q,p) = {A\u2032 (Q,\n~ P~ ), B \u2032 (Q,\n~ P~ )}(Q,P ),\n{A(~q(Q,\n\n(13)\n\n~ P~ ) are fully equivalent:\nand thus the Hamiltonian equations of motion in the variables (~q, ~p) and (Q,\nthey yield identical mathematical solutions and thus identical physical predictions.\nThis picture does not translate to Moyal quantum mechanics. To see this explicitly let us\ngo back to standard operator quantum mechanics and consider, to make it simpler, the unitary\ntransformation:\n\u02c6~ \u02c6~\n\u02c6~ \u22121\n\u02c6~q \u2261 \u02c6~q(Q,\nP ) = \u00db Q\n\u00db\n\n\u02c6~ \u02c6~\n\u02c6\n, \u02c6~p \u2261 \u02c6~p(Q,\nP ) = \u00db P~ \u00db \u22121\n4\n\n\u02c6~ \u02c6~ \u22121\n\u02c6~ \u02c6~\n, \u00c2(\u02c6~q, \u02c6p~) \u2261 \u00db \u00c2(Q,\nP )\u00db = \u00c2\u2032 (Q,\nP ).\n\n(14)\n\n\fThe two sets of fundamental variables provide two Weyl-Wigner maps:\n~ ~\n~ + h\u0304 Y~ >,\n~ \u2212 h\u0304 Y~ |\u00c2|Q\ndN Y~ e\u2212iP *Y < Q\n2\n2\nZ\nh\u0304\nh\u0304\nN\n\u2212i~\np*~\ny\nW(q,p) (\u00c2) =\nd ~y e\n< ~q \u2212 ~y |\u00c2|~q + ~y >,\n2\n2\n\nW(Q,P ) (\u00c2) =\n\nZ\n\n(15)\n\nfrom which we can derive the action of unitary transformations in the Moyal formalism.

For two general observables A(~q, p~) and B(~q, p~) we\nhave:\n~ P~ ), B \u2032 (Q,\n~ P~ )]M\n[A\u2032 (Q,\n= T ([A(~q, ~p), B(~q, ~p)]M(q,p) ),\n(19)\n(Q,P )\n~ P~ ) and (~q, ~p):\nand thus the Moyal dynamical equations in the variables (Q,\n\u0226(~q, p~; t) = [A(~q, ~p; t), H(~q, ~p)]M(q,p)\n\n~ P~ ; t) = [A\u2032 (Q,\n~ P~ ; t), H \u2032 (Q,\n~ P~ )]M\nand \u0226\u2032 (Q,\n,\n(Q,P )\n\n(20)\n\nyield two mathematical solutions, related by:\n~ P~ , t) = U \u2217(Q,P ) F (Q,\n~ P~ , t) \u2217(Q,P ) U \u22121 ,\nA(t) = F (~q, ~p, t) and A\u2032 (t) = F \u2032 (Q,\n\n(21)\n\n~ P~ , t) 6= F (~q(Q,\n~ P~ ), p~(Q,\n~ P~ ), t),\nwhich, in general are not the same phase space function: F \u2032 (Q,\nalbeit providing the same physical predictions: eqs.(8,9,10). We see that no physical meaning can\nbe attached to a single value of the observable A since this value is dependent of the particular\nrepresentation chosen. Take for instance the Wigner distribution function that may be positive\ndefined in one representation and become negative under a unitary transformation.\nOn the other hand, most coordinate transformations act non-canonically in the Moyal formalism\n(the exceptions, once again, are linear transformations): consider the transformation T eq.(16) and\nthe two general phase space functions G(~q, p~) and F (~q, ~p). In general we have:\n~ P~ ), p~(Q,\n~ P~ )), F (~q(Q,\n~ P~ ), p~(Q,\n~ P~ ))]M\n~ P~ ), ~p(Q,\n~ P~ )), F (~q(Q,\n~ P~ ), p~(Q,\n~ P~ ))]M\n[G(~q(Q,\n6= [G(~q(Q,\n,\n(q,p)\n(Q,P )\n(22)\nwhich is a consequence of the fact that the star product (sometimes expressed in terms of the\nsymmetric bracket [13]) is also not invariant under a general coordinate transformation:\n~ P~ ), p~(Q,\n~ P~ )) \u2217(q,p) F (~q(Q,\n~ P~ ), ~p(Q,\n~ P~ )) 6= G(~q(Q,\n~ P~ ), ~p(Q,\n~ P~ )) \u2217(Q,P ) F (~q(Q,\n~ P~ ), p~(Q,\n~ P~ )).\nG(~q(Q,\n(23)\n5\n\n\fThese features of the Weyl-Wigner map and consequently of the star product are well known and\nhave been extensively studied in the past (see for instance [14, 15]). Namely, it was proved that the\nset of observables invariant under general unitary transformations is the set of first order polynomials\nin the fundamental variables and the coordinate transformations that preserve the star product are\nthe linear transformations.\nFrom the previous analysis we see that the behavior of Moyal quantum mechanics under the\naction of canonical and coordinate transformations is a direct consequence of the definition of the\nWeyl-Wigner map (15). This motivates the purpose of the next section where we will present a\ngeneralization of the Weyl-Wigner map and use it to prove that unitary operator transformations\ncan be implemented as coordinate transformations in the Moyal formalism. Furthermore, we will\nsee in section 4 that the new map provides a derivation of Vey covariant quantum mechanics directly\nfrom standard operator quantum mechanics.\n\n3\n\nGeneralized Weyl-Wigner map\n\n~ P~ ) (which are not required\nWe start by introducing a new Weyl-Wigner map in the variables (Q,\nto be canonical) that copies the Weyl-Wigner map in the variables (~q, p~):\nDefinition: Generalized Weyl-Wigner map\nLet W(q,p) be the standard Weyl-Wigner map (in the variables (~q, ~p)) from the algebra of linear\noperators \u00c2(H) acting on the physical Hilbert space H to the algebra of observables in the phase\n~ P~ ), assumed in one-to-one correspondence with the canonical\nspace T \u2217 M.

They all are scalar functions over (T \u2217 M, J ij , gij ), and\nfW\n(Q,\nare related with the mathematical objects of standard operator quantum mechanics through the\n\u2032\n\u2032 ~ ~\n\u2032\n~ P~ ; t) = W \u2032\ngeneralized Weyl-Wigner map: fW\n(Q,\n(Q,P ) (|\u03c8(t) >< \u03c8(t)|) and A (Q, P ; t) = W(Q,P ) (\u00c2)\nThe time evolution of the Wigner function is given by the dynamical equation:\n\u2032\n\u2032\n]M(Q,P\nf \u0307 \u2032 W = [H \u2032 , fW\n)\n\n(55)\n\nwhich transforms covariantly under arbitrary phase space difeomorphisms yielding, in any coordinates, identical mathematical solutions and thus identical physical predictions.\nFinally, the covariant form of eqs. (7) and (8) yield the physical relevant predictions. The Moyal\nstar-genvalue equation can be obtained, through the Weyl-Wigner map, from the standard operator\neigenvalue equation: \u00c2|\u03c8an >< \u03c8an | = a|\u03c8an >< \u03c8an | (where n is the degeneracy index).

All key ingredients\nof the theory were derived in this fashion thus casting Vey quantum mechanics at the same level\nof completeness as Moyal quantum mechanics. Furthermore we studied the action of standard\noperator transformations in the Moyal formalism and concluded that through the generalized WeylWigner map these transformations can be implemented as phase space coordinate transformations\nin the Moyal idiom. It is now easy to realize that the group of \"canonical\" transformations of Vey\nquantum mechanics (those that preserve the bracket structure) is the subgroup of the symplectic\ntransformations which are also isometries, i.e. the coordinate transformations O i \u2192 O i (O \u2032s ) such\nthat:\n\u2032ij\nij\n\u2202O \u2032i \u2202O \u2032j kl\nJ(Q,P\n) = \u2202O k \u2202O l J(q,p) = J(q,p) ,\n(59)\n\u2202O \u2032i \u2202 2 O b\n\u2032i\n\u0393jk = \u2202Ob \u2202O\u2032j \u2202O\u2032k = 0,\n11\n\n\fand notice that in the limit h\u0304 \u2192 0 the requirement on the isometry character of the canonical\ntransformations disappears, as it should, and we recover the standard sympletic group of classical\nmechanics.\nFinally, let us make a small remark concerning possible future applications of the generalized\nWeyl-Wigner map. Recently there has been a considerable interest in developing a fully classical\ninterpretation for Moyal dynamics [14, 15, 19]. This is a difficult task for several reasons of which\nthe most important are that Moyal dynamics is non-local and there is no general criterion to\nunderstand what is meant by \"classical\". Very recently, however the authors presented a proposal\nfor a classicality criterion and proved that it is fully compatible with the Weyl-Wigner map [18, 19].\nOne of the problems that were left unsolved was how to understand the highly non-classical behavior\nof an allegedly Moyal classical dynamics, under the action of canonical transformations. This\nproblem has been previously considered in [14, 15] using an approach based on a privileged set of\nobservables.\nWe may now expect that if the results of [19] (concerning the compatibility between the classicality criteria and the Weyl-Wigner map) turn out to be extendable to the covariant Weyl-Wigner\nmap, then they will most likely open the path for a consistent classical interpretation of the action\nof canonical transformations in Moyal dynamics. This will be the subject of a future work [30].\n\n6\n\nExample\n\nTo illustrate some of the features of the formalism let us consider the system of two interacting\nparticles described by the Hamiltonian:\n\u0124 =\n\np\u03022\n\u0177 2\n+\n+ k q\u0302 \u0177 2 ,\n2M\n2m\n\n(60)\n\nwhere (q\u0302, p\u0302) are the fundamental variables of the particle of mass M, (x\u0302, \u0177) the ones of the particle\nof mass m and k is a coupling constant.\na) Standard description in the original variables. In the Heisenberg picture the time evolution\nof the former system is given by:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\nk 2 2\nq\u0302(t) = q\u0302 + Mp\u0302 t \u2212 2M\n\u0177 t\n2\np\u0302(t) = p\u0302 \u2212 k \u0177 t\nx\u0302(t) = x\u0302 + { m\u0177 + 2k q\u0302\u0177}t +\n\u0177(t) = \u0177\n\nk\np\u0302\u0177t2\nM\n\n\u2212\n\nk2 3 3\n\u0177 t\n3M\n\n(61)\n\nThe standard Weyl-Wigner transform yields the Moyal description of the system. The Hamiltonian\nis trivially obtained:\np2\ny2\nH = W(q,x,p,y)(\u0124) =\n+\n+ kqy 2 ,\n(62)\n2M\n2m\nand the Moyal time evolution of the system is given by the dynamical equations:\n\u0226 = [A, H]Mq,x,p,y ,\n\n12\n\n(63)\n\n\fwhich yield the following solutions (to make it simpler let us concentrate on the dynamics of the\nparticle of mass M):\n(\nk\nt \u2212 2M\ny(0)2t2\nq(t) = q(0) + p(0)\nM\n(64)\n2\np(t) = p(0) \u2212 ky(0) t\nNotice that the same predictions can be obtained by applying the Weyl-Wigner map to the solutions\n(61).\nb) Canonical transformation and the standard description in the new variables. Let us now\nconsider the canonical transformation:\n(\n\nq\u0302 = q\u0302\np\u0302 = p\u0302\n\n(\n\n,\n\nx\u0302 = ln Q\u0302\n\u0177 = 21 (Q\u0302P\u0302 + P\u0302 Q\u0302).\n\n(65)\n\nIn the new variables \u0124 takes the form:\n\u0124 =\n\np\u03022\n(Q\u0302P\u0302 + P\u0302 Q\u0302)2 k\n+\n+ q\u0302(Q\u0302P\u0302 + P\u0302 Q\u0302)2 ,\n2M\n8m\n4\n\n(66)\n\nand it yields the Heisenberg picture time evolution (still just for the particle of mass M):\n(\n\nk\nq\u0302(t) = q\u0302 + Mp\u0302 t \u2212 8M\n(Q\u0302P\u0302 + P\u0302 Q\u0302)2 t2\np\u0302(t) = p\u0302 \u2212 k4 (Q\u0302P\u0302 + P\u0302 Q\u0302)2 t\n\n(67)\n\nTo obtain the Moyal formulation of the system in the variables (q, Q, p, P ) the first step is to use\nthe standard Weyl-Wigner map to get the phase space representation of the transformation (65):\n(\n\nq = W(q,Q,p,P )(q\u0302) = q\np = W(q,Q,p,P )(p\u0302) = p\n\n,\n\n(\n\nx = W(q,Q,p,P )(x\u0302(Q\u0302, P\u0302 )) = ln Q\ny = W(q,Q,p,P )(\u0177(Q\u0302, P\u0302 )) = QP\n\n(68)\n\nWe then express the Hamiltonian using the standard Weyl order prescription:\n\u0124W (q,Q,p,P ) =\n\np\u03022\n(P\u0302 2Q\u03022 )S\nk\nh\u03042\n+\n+ k q\u0302(Q\u03022 P\u0302 2 )S + h\u03042 q\u0302 +\n,\n2M\n2m\n4\n8m\n\n(69)\n\nwhere we used the fact that 14 (Q\u0302P\u0302 + P\u0302 Q\u0302)2W (q,Q,p,P ) = (P\u0302 2Q\u03022 )S + h\u03042 /4, (the subscripted \"S\" standing\nfor the full symmetrization of the operator) and so 14 (Q\u0302P\u0302 + P\u0302 Q\u0302)2 can be expressed in the standard\nWeyl order (eq.(25)) by making \u03b1(a, b, c, d) = \u03b4(a)\u03b4(b){\u03b4 \u2032\u2032 (c)\u03b4 \u2032\u2032 (d) + h\u0304/4\u03b4(c)\u03b4(d)} where a, b, c, d\nare the integration variables associated to the fundamental operatores q\u0302, p\u0302, Q\u0302, P\u0302 , respectively. The\nstandard Weyl-Wigner transform of \u0124 is thus:\nH = W(q,Q,p,P )(\u0124) =\n\nP 2 Q2\nk\nh\u03042\np2\n+\n+ kqQ2 P 2 + h\u03042 q +\n.\n2M\n2m\n4\n8m\n\n(70)\n\nFinally, the Moyal dynamical equations in the variables (q, Q, p, P ) yield:\n(\n\nk\nt \u2212 2M\nQ(0)2 P (0)2t2 \u2212\nq(t) = q(0) + p(0)\nM\n2\np(t) = p(0) \u2212 kQ(0)2 P (0)2t \u2212 kh\u03044 t2 .\n\n13\n\nkh\u03042 2\nt\n8M\n\n(71)\n\n\fNotice that equivalent results can be obtained by applying the Weyl-Wigner transform to the time\nevolution operator equations (67). Furthermore, we realize that the transformation (65) does not\nact as a coordinate transformation in the Moyal formalism. Taking for instance the Hamiltonian,\nwe have: H(q, p, x(Q, P ), y(Q, P )) 6= W(q,Q,p,P )(\u0124) the left hand side being given by eq.(62) and\nthe right hand side by eq.(70). Consequently the two phase space orbits (eqs.(64,71)) are not the\ncoordinate transformation of each other.\nc) Covariant formulation. Finally, let us use the generalized Weyl-Wigner map. In the generalized Weyl order prescription eq.(29), we make \u03b1(a, b, c, d) = \u2212\u03b4(a)\u03b4(b)\u03b4(c)\u03b4 \u2032\u2032 (d) - where, this time\na, b, c, d are the integration variables associated to the fundamental operators q\u0302, p\u0302, x\u0302(Q\u0302, P\u0302 ), \u0177(Q\u0302, P\u0302 )\n- and get:\n1\n1\n(Q\u0302P\u0302 + P\u0302 Q\u0302)2W \u2032 (q,Q,p,P ) = (Q\u0302P\u0302 Q\u0302P\u0302 + Q\u0302P\u0302 2 Q\u0302 + P\u0302 Q\u03022 P\u0302 + P\u0302 Q\u0302P\u0302 Q\u0302),\n(72)\n4\n4\nand thus:\nQ2 P 2\np2\n\u2032\n+\n+ kqQ2 P 2 ,\n(73)\nH \u2032 (q, Q, p, P ) = W(q,Q,p,P\n)(\u0124) =\n2M\n2m\nwhich, as expected is the coordinate transformation of the observable H given by eq.(62). The new\n\u2032ij\nij\nstar product and the new bracket are given by eqs.(52) and (53), respectively, where J(Q,P\n) = J(q,p)\nand the covariant derivatives are associated to the Christoffel symbols:\n\u0393\u20321\n11 = \u22121/Q;\n\n2\n\u0393\u20322\n11 = P/Q ;\n\n\u20322\n\u0393\u20322\n12 = \u039321 = 1/Q,\n\n(74)\n\nall the others being zero (we used the notation: O 1 = x; O 2 = y; O \u20321 = Q; O \u20322 = P ; O \u20323 = O 3 =\nq; O \u20324 = O 4 = p). Notice that using the new product we can go back and obtain the Hamiltonian\nH \u2032 through a slightly different procedure, by making:\n1\n1\n(Q\u0302P\u0302 + P\u0302 Q\u0302) (Q\u0302P\u0302 + P\u0302 Q\u0302)\n(75)\n2\n2\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\n= W(q,Q,p,P\n(Q\u0302P\u0302 + P\u0302 Q\u0302) \u2217\u2032(q,Q,p,P ) W(q,Q,p,P\n(Q\u0302P\u0302 + P\u0302 Q\u0302) = QP \u2217\u2032(q,Q,p,P ) QP = Q2 P 2 ,\n)\n)\n2\n2\n\u2032\nW(q,Q,p,P\n)\n\n\u001a\n\n\u001b\n\nwhere in the last step we used the explicit expression for the new star product (52,74). It is now easy\n\u2032\nyield solutions that\nto check that the generalized Moyal dynamical equations, \u022e \u2032i = [O \u2032i , H \u2032 ]M(q,Q,p,P\n)\nare just the coordinate transformation of the original ones (64). Equivalent results can obviously be\nobtained by applying the generalized Weyl-Wigner map to the operator time evolution equations\n(67).\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was partially supported by the grants ESO/PRO/1258/98 and CERN/P/Fis/15190/1999.\n\nReferences\n[1] H.Weyl, Z.
