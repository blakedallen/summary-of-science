An analytical expression is\nderived for the ratio of radiation quality factors of such antennas and conventional patch antennas loaded with (reference)\ndielectrics. In the ideal case this ratio depends only on the\npropagation constant and wave impedance of the structure under\ntest, and it can be conveniently used to study what kind of\ndispersion leads to improved impedance bandwidth. We illustrate\nthe effect of dispersion by implementing a resonant patch\nantenna using a periodic network of LC elements. The analytical\nresults predicting enhanced impedance bandwidth compared to\nthe reference results are validated using a commercial circuit\nsimulator. Discussion is conducted on the practical limitations\nfor the use of the proposed expression.\nIndex Terms- Patch antenna, miniaturization, radiation quality factor, impedance bandwidth, loaded transmission line\n\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nSize reduction of patch antennas using different materials\nfilling the volume under the antenna element is a classical\nminiaturization technique [1]. Typically, conventional dielectric substrates have been used to decrease the physical dimensions of the radiator, and it is known that the impedance\nbandwidth decreases roughly inversely with increasing the\neffective permittivity of the substrate (with a fixed substrate\nheight) [2]. It has been observed, however, that increase of\nthe effective substrate permeability has only a small effect on\nthe bandwidth, if the permeability is assumed to be lossless\nand dispersion-free [2], [3]. This observation has lead to a\nflow of research concerning patch antenna miniaturization\nusing magnetodielectric substrates, e.g. [4]\u2013 [6]. Recently,\nalso several other exotic materials have been proposed for\nsize reduction: For example, authors of [7] proposed to use\na reactive impedance substrate, and authors of [8], [9] studied\nminiaturization using double-negative metamaterials.\nFrom the commonly used transmission-line (TL) representation of a patch antenna [1] it is clear that the purpose of\ndifferent loading materials is to optimize the input susceptance\nseen at the antenna terminal, while maintaining the radiation\nconductance at a reasonable level. If the antenna geometry leaves the radiation conductance intact, the dispersion\ncharacteristics of the loading material solely determine the\nimpedance bandwidth performance of the antenna under test\nThe authors are with the Radio Laboratory/SMARAD Centre of Excellence,\nHelsinki University of Technology, P.O. Box 3000, FI-02015 TKK, Finland.\n(e-mail: pekka.ikonen@tkk.fi).\n\n(AUT) compared to the performance of the same-size reference antenna, miniaturized using normal dielectrics. Authors\nof [5], [6] derived an analytical expression for the ratio of\nradiation quality factors (Qrel\nr ) of the above referred antennas\n(resonant AUT and the reference antenna), and used this\nratio as a figure of merit to test the suitability of different\nmaterials in efficient antenna miniaturization. Qrel\nr derived in\n[5], [6] is solely a function of the effective AUT (substrate)\nmaterial parameters, and it can be used when the material is\nhomogeneous and it is meaningful to assign effective material\nparameters (for other criteria, please see [6]).\nRecently, there have been suggestions to manipulate the\ndispersion characteristics of patch antennas by implementing\nthe actual antennas as periodic networks of LC elements\n[10]\u2013 [12]. The aim has been to reduce the resonant length\nby synthesizing large propagation constants for the network.\nOne interesting related idea would be to synthesize a network\nwhose wave impedance and propagation constant resemble\nthose of weakly dispersive high-permeability materials. If the\nimplemented LC network comprising the antenna would still\nallow effective radiation (the radiation conductance would not\ndeteriorate due to implementation details), one could possibly\nbenefit from the advantages of magnetic loading [3] and\nweaken the strong \"negative\" effect of frequency dispersion\n[5]. This expectation follows from the important fact that\nthe performance of the network is not based on resonant\ninclusions.\nTo be able to synthesize the desired dispersion characteristics for the network it would be convenient to have a figure of\nmerit that would immediately tell if the proposed dispersion\nallows the realization of a wider impedance bandwidth than\nreference dielectrics. If the unit cell dimension is not very\nsmall, it might be more meaningful to characterize the network\nusing its effective propagation constant and wave impedance,\nrather than the extracted material parameters [13]. Thus, Qrel\nr\nproposed in [5], [6] might not be directly applicable. Here\nwe derive a figure of merit, similar to that in [5], [6], but\nexpressed as a function of the effective wave impedance and\npropagation constant of the structure/material under test. This\nfigure of merit is used to design a patch antenna with enhanced\nimpedance bandwidth compared to the reference antenna using\na periodic network of LC elements.\nII. F ORMULATION\nConsider a rectangular patch antenna having width w, height\nh, and length l. The volume under the patch element is loaded\n\n\f2\n\nFig. 1.\n\nwhere k0 , \u03b70 are the free space wave number and wave\nimpedance, respectively. From the requirement that both antennas should have the resonant length at the same frequency,\nwe get a relation between \u03b2 and \u01ebref :\nq\nc0\n\u03b2\n\u01ebref\n,\n(8)\nc0 =\nr =\n\u03c9\nvph\n\nPatch antenna represented as a transmission-line section.\n\nwith a certain low-loss material. The TL-representation of the\nantenna is shown in Fig. 1. Using standard TL-equations we\ncan write the input admittance of the antenna in the following\nform:\nG[1 + j YG tan(\u03b2l)]\n,\n(1)\nYin = G +\n1+jG\nY tan(\u03b2l)\nwhere Y = 1/Z is the characteristic admittance of the\nequivalent TL, G is the radiation conductance, and \u03b2 is\nthe equivalent propagation constant of the antenna segment.\nWhen the antenna operates close to its fundamental (parallel)\nresonance (\u03b2l \u2248 \u03c0), tan(\u03b2l) has a very small value. Thus,\nafter applying Taylor expansion to the denominator of (1) we\ncan write the input admittance in the following approximate\nform:\nY 2 \u2212 G2\nYin \u2248 2G + j\ntan(\u03b2l).\n(2)\nY\nTypically the height of a resonant patch is a small fraction\nof the wavelength and noticeably smaller than the width\nof the antenna. By applying standard expressions, typically\nused to estimate the characteristic admittance and radiation\nconductance [1], we observe that Y 2 \u226b G2 , and the input\nadmittance can further be simplified as\nYin \u2248 2G + jY tan(\u03b2l).\n\n(3)\n\nOne of the definitions for the quality factor of a resonator\noperating close to its parallel resonance reads [14]\nQ=\n\n\u03c9 \u2202B\n2G \u2202\u03c9\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\n\u03c9=\u03c9x\n\nwhere B is the input susceptance and \u03c9x is the operational\nangular frequency of the resonator. In our case eq. (4) is the\nradiation quality factor since only radiation losses are assumed.\nWe get the following expression for the quality factor after\ndifferentiating the input susceptance:\nQ=\n\n\u03c9 l \u2202\u03b2\n2G Z \u2202\u03c9\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\n\u03c9=\u03c9x\n\nTake a resonant patch antenna loaded with a dispersion-free\np\ndielectric material offering the same size reduction [k0 \u01ebref\nr =\n\u03b2(\u03c9x )] as a reference antenna. The ratio of the quality factors\nof the two antennas becomes\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\nZ ref \u2202\u03b2 \u2202\u03b2 ref\nQ\nrel\n,\n(6)\nQ = ref = m\nQ\nZ \u2202\u03c9 \u2202\u03c9\nwhere we m = Gref /G is the ratio of radiation conductances.\nIn the quasi-static regime the propagation constant and characteristic impedance for the reference case read [14]\nq\nh 1\n\u03b2 ref = k0 \u01ebref\nZ ref = \u03b70 p\n,\n(7)\nr ,\nw \u01ebref\nr\n\nwhere vph is the phase velocity in the equivalent transmissionline of the AUT. Moreover, the relation between the effective wave impedance Zw of the AUT and the characteristic\nimpedance reads in our geometry [14]\nh\nZw .\nw\nAfter this the ratio of quality factors takes the form\nZ=\n\nQrel =\n\n2\nQ\n\u2202\u03b2\n\u03b70 vph\n=\nm\nQref\nc0 Zw \u2202\u03c9\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\n\u03c9=\u03c9x\n\n1) Comparing the obtained expression with previously introduced expression: The ratio of (radiation) quality factors\nof ideally shaped resonant patch antennas (AUT and reference\nantenna) was derived in the following form in [5], [6]:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nQ\n1\n1 \u2202(\u03c9\u03bcr )\n1 \u2202(\u03c9\u01ebr )\nrel\nQ = ref =\n+\n, (11)\nQ\n2\u03bcr \u03bcr \u2202\u03c9\n\u01ebr \u2202\u03c9\n\u03c9=\u03c9x\nwhere \u01ebr , \u03bcr are the AUT effective (substrate) material parameters (low losses are assumed). To derive eq. (11) authors of [5],\n[6] integrated the field energy density over the volume of the\nantenna, and further applied standard definitions to calculate\nthe quality factors using stored electromagnetic energy and\nradiated power.\nLet us in the following assume that m = 1 and we can\nassign effective material parameters for the tested material.\nWe adopt the notation considered in [5], [6]:\nr\n\u03c9\u221a\nh \u03bcr\n\u03b2=\n.\n(12)\n\u03bcr \u01ebr , Z = \u03b70\nc0\nw \u01ebr\nWith the above notations eq. (10) transforms into\nr\nQ\nc0\n\u01ebr \u2202\u03b2\nQrel = ref =\n,\nQ\n\u01ebr \u03bcr \u03bcr \u2202\u03c9 \u03c9=\u03c9x\n\n(13)\n\nand after differentiating the propagation constant we get the\nsame expression as (11).\n2) Comments related to the practical use of eq. (10): When\nderiving eq. (11) authors of [5], [6] assumed that m = 1\nsince the considered antennas had the same-size continuous\nmetal plates acting as antenna elements, and the classical\nassumption according to which the width of the radiating edge\npredominantly determines the radiation conductance [1], was\nused. However, in the real antenna implementations based\non LC element networks the actual (realizable) radiation\nproperties might not be so easily predicted by standard TLexpressions: Authors of [10] observed that the power delivered\nto the furthermost radiating slot was 2 dB lower than the\npower delivered to the first slot. In addition to this, parasitic\nradiation from the inductors (affecting the fringing field) was\nreported. Later authors of [11] presented an empirical formula\nto estimate the radiation conductance of antennas based on\n\n\f3\n\nIII.

We can see that Qrel\nis below unity over a wide\nr\nfrequency band when the antenna operates in the right-hand\nbranch (forward wave) of the dispersion curve. Initial simulations with different TL-structures1 have shown that the\neffective permeability is high and weakly dispersive only in the\nright-hand branch. This is reflected also in the result depicted\nin Fig. 5, which resembles the result obtained using weakly\ndispersive magnetic materials under the antenna element [5],\n[6].\nThe designed antenna has length l = 7 \u00d7 p = 35 mm and\nwidth w = 8 \u00d7 p = 40 mm (see the schematic illustration in\n1 For which it is meaningful to assign effective material parameters due to\nvery small period p compared to the wavelength.\n\n2\n\nQr\n\nrel\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n1\n\nFig. 2.\nTransmission-line periodically loaded with bulk capacitors and\ninductors.

We use eq. (10) to choose practically realizable network parameters so that Qrel\nr goes below\nunity, i.e. the TL-antenna is more wideband than the samesize reference antenna. It is assumed that m = 1 since we\ncannot at this stage readily predict the influence of the practical\nrealization to the equivalent radiation conductance or voltage\nwave pattern.\nThe Bloch impedance ZB and propagation constant \u03b2 in\nthe one-dimensional (1D) line are calculated using the design\nequations available in [15]. Similarly as in [16] we relate\nthe Bloch impedance to the effective wave impedance in the\nequivalent homogeneous line:\np\n(14)\nZw = ZB ,\nh\nwhere p is the unit cell period and h is the height of the\n(network) substrate. With the help of eq.

Authors of [12] reported rather low\nradiation efficiencies, and speculated that the low efficiencies\nwere due to large currents concentrated near vias implemented\nas lossy conductors. In this case the standing wave pattern on\nthe antenna element might not be anymore a pure sin-function\nas in a normal patch. This has a natural implication on the\nradiated power since most of the radiation should still happen\ndue to fringing fields (represented as a conductance sitting at\nthe patch edge where maximum of voltage should occur).\nDue to the above uncertainties that depend highly on the\nparticular implementation details, and the empirical expression\nfor G found in [11], we assume in the following generally\nthat m \u2265 1. With this assumption we are able to study the\ndispersion characteristics of the tested structures/materials separately from the radiation properties. If the proposed dispersion\nis desirable, one should still before the final implementation\nmake sure that the antenna radiates properly.\n\nFig. 5.\n\n1.5\n\n2\nf [GHz]\n\nThe relative radiation quality factor.\n\n2.5\n\n\f4\n\nIV. C ONCLUSION\nWe have derived an explicit expression for the ratio of\nradiation quality factors of resonant patch antennas, 1) implemented using structures having engineered dispersion and\n2) loaded with conventional dielectrics. This expression allows\nto study conveniently what kind of dispersion leads to efficient\nsize reduction. As an example, a patch antenna with desirable\ndispersion characteristics has been implemented using a periodical network of LC elements.\nFig. 6.\n\nSchematic illustration of the patch antenna.\n\nFig. 6) with the predicted resonant frequency around 2.5 GHz.\nThe inductors and capacitors have been removed from the last\nperiods near the radiating edges to minimize their effect on\nthe fringing fields. We use data in Figs. 3, 4 to calculate\nthe reflection coefficient for the TL-antenna using the TLmodel introduced in [5], [6]. The calculation is repeated for\na reference antenna loaded with dispersion-free dielectrics. In\nthe TL-model, a short section of empty TL is left near the\nradiating edges to reflect the absence of bulk components (the\nsame empty space is left in the reference calculation). In the\ncalculations l\u2032 = p, and w\u2032 has been varied to tune the quality\nof matching to be the same with both antennas.\nThe results of calculations are depicted in Fig. 7. We\nhave also implemented the TL-antenna in the Agilent ADS\ncircuit simulator (no reference antenna simulations have been\nperformed since the quantitative accuracy of the TL-model\nfor this case has been demonstrated earlier [6]). Radiation\nhas been modeled both in the TL-model and in ADS by an\nequivalent radiation conductance G = Gref = 1/90(w/\u03bb0 )2\ncalculated from the reflection data is\n[1], see Fig. 1. Qrel\nr\n0.66, whereas eq. (10) gives 0.69. The result predicted by\nADS closely agrees with the TL-result (with a fixed G) and\nvalidates the feasibility of the proposed network (dispersion)\nin antenna miniaturization. We have to bear in mind, however,\nthat in the practical LC network implementation the radiation\nmight be weaker [10], [12] than predicted by the standard\nexpressions for G given in [1]. This effect is, however, highly\ndependent on the implementation details.\n0\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\u22123\n|\u03c1| [dB]\n\n\u22124\n\u22125\n\u22126\n\u22127\n\u22128\nTL\u2212antenna\nRef. antenna\nTL\u2212antenna (ADS)\n\n\u22129\n\u221210\n2.2\n\n2.3\n\n2.4\n\n2.5\n\n2.6\n\n2.7\n\nf [GHz]\n\nFig. 7.
