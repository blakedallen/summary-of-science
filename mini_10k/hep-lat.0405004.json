We find evidence for a finite temperature deconfinement transition driven by the condensation of U (1) magnetic charges. A finite-size scaling test\nshows consistency with the critical exponents of the 3D Ising model.\n\nLattice SU(N) pure gauge theories in the fundamental representation undergo\na finite temperature deconfinement phase transition [1,2] signalled by the spontaneous breaking of the global center symmetry ZN [3,4]. It is an interesting\nquestion whether this happens also for the theory in the adjoint representation SU(N)/ZN [5]. In the latter case the center is trivial and naively there is\nno global symmetry to be broken. Moreover, although both the fundamental\nand the adjoint SU(N) lattice theories have the same naive continuum limit,\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n31 October 2018\n\n\fnon-perturbative investigations carried out for Wilson [6,7] as well as for Villain discretizations [8] showed a different behavior. For the adjoint cases no\nevidence for a finite temperature phase transition was found, whereas a bulk\ntransition separating the strong from the weak coupling regions appeared for\nboth kinds of discretizations.\nThe bulk transition was explained in terms of a condensation of lattice artifacts - Z2 monopoles [8]. It was argued that the finite temperature transition\ncould be overshadowed by the bulk one and Z2 monopole suppression terms\nwere thus proposed [9]. More recently the Villain mixed fundamental-adjoint\nSU(2) model with a monopole (and vortex) suppression has been reinvestigated [10,11,12] and first evidence for a deconfinement transition in the Ising\n3D universality class, at least for strong coupling (N\u03c4 = 2), was given. Moreover, in the weak coupling region negative states of the Polyakov loop in the\nadjoint representation were found [10,13] and later linked to the non-trivial\ntwist sectors of the theory [14], given that on the hypertorus T 4 the partition function of the SO(3) theory in the Villain formulation with complete\nZ2 monopole suppression was shown to be equivalent to that of the SU(2)\ntheory in the fundamental representation when summed over all twist sectors\n[15,16,17,18].\nIn a recent paper we have reinvestigated the SO(3) theory using the Wilson\naction and a Z2 monopole suppression term with a \"chemical potential\" \u03bb\n[19,20,21,22]. The phase diagram in the \u03b2A \u2212 \u03bb plane was studied at zero\nand finite temperature monitoring the tunneling between twist sectors and\nits disappearance for strong enough Z2 monopole suppression. For \u03bb \u2265 .85\nwe have found a strong indication for the existence of a finite temperature\ndeconfinement transition although having restricted the simulation to a fixed\n2\n\n\f(e.g. trivial) twist sector.

The phases are characterized by\n(non)vanishing values of the monopole density M , the average adjoint Polyakov\nloop hLA i and the averaged electric twist variable hz\u0303i (see [21]).\n\nexponents was not intended, and there was no answer given to the question\nabout the underlying confinement mechanism.\nA disorder parameter related to Abelian monopole condensation in the dual\nsuperconductivity picture of confinement [23,24,25] has been devised by the\nPisa group some time ago [26,27,28,29,30]. It is the vacuum expectation value\nof a magnetically charged operator h\u03bci shown to be different from zero in\nthe confined phase, thus signaling dual superconductivity, and going to zero\nat the deconfining phase transition. Similar parameters have been constructed\nmore recently by Fr\u00f6hlich and Marchetti [31] as well as in the framework of\nthe lattice Schr\u00f6dinger functional [32,33] leading to analogous results. The\nmain advantage of these parameters is that they can be applied also to full\nQCD, where the center symmetry is explicitly broken by the fermionic degrees\n3\n\n\fof freedom and - as we shall show - to the adjoint pure gauge theory, where\ncenter symmetry becomes trivial. In this letter we will use the Pisa disorder\noperator in order to answer the questions raised above for the SO(3) lattice\ngauge theory. In particular we will check the critical exponents and whether\nthe dual superconductor scenario applies also to this case.\nWe will study the SU(2) adjoint representation Wilson action modified by a\nZ2 monopole suppression term\n\n4 X\nTr2F UP\nS = \u03b2A\n1\u2212\n3\n4\nP\nwhere the product \u03c3c =\n\nQ\n\n!\n\nP \u2208\u2202c\n\n+\u03bb\n\nX\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03c3c ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nc\n\nsign(TrF UP ), taken around elementary 3-cubes\n\nc, defines the Z2 magnetic charges. Their density can be introduced as M =\n1 \u2212 h N1c\n\nP\n\nc\n\n\u03c3c i normalized such that it tends to one in the strong coupling\n\nregion and to zero in the weak coupling limit, Nc denoting the total number\nof elementary 3-cubes. Although \u03c3c is constructed in terms of fundamental\nrepresentation plaquettes, it is a natural SO(3) quantity ensuring that the\naction (1) is center-blind in the entire \u03b2A \u2212 \u03bb plane. The link variables can\nbe represented both by SO(3) or SU(2) matrices, exploiting the property\nTrA = Tr2F \u2212 1 for the Wilson term or picking a random SU(2) representative\nof the SO(3) link to construct the Z2 monopole contribution. A standard\nMetropolis algorithm has been used to update the links. In [21] we have found\na strong indication in favor of finite temperature phase transitions with lines\nmoving up with the time-like lattice extent N\u03c4 and running away from the\nbulk transition approximately parallel to the \u03bb axis (see Fig. 1).\nThe Pisa disorder operator [26,27,28,29,30] was shown to be a reliable order\nparameter for SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories in the fundamental repre4\n\n\fsentation, with and without dynamical quarks, giving critical exponents in\nagreement with other order parameters. Moreover, it can give important informations about the mechanism which confines quarks into hadrons. The\nPisa disorder operator is motivated by the dual superconductor scenario for\nthe QCD vacuum [23,24,25], driven by the condensation of U(1) magnetic\ncharges. The construction of the operator in the case of the modified SO(3)\ntheory follows the same line as in the fundamental case, so we will avoid going into the details and we will refer to the original papers for further details\n[26,27,28,29,30].\nThe idea is to construct a magnetically charged operator \u03bc which shifts the\nquantum field at a given time slice by a classical external field corresponding\nto a magnetic monopole. The U(1) subgroup of the gauge group which defines the magnetic charge is selected by an Abelian projection, usually fixed\nby diagonalizing an operator X in the adjoint representation. The disorder\nparameter is defined as\n\nh\u03bc(t)i =\n\nR\n\n(DU)M e\u2212SM (t)\nR\n,\n(DU)e\u2212S\n\n(2)\n\nwhere SM (t) denotes the Wilson action with the space-time plaquettes Ui4 (~x, t)\nat a fixed time-slice t modified by an insertion of an external monopole field\nUei4 (~x, t) = Ui (~x, t)\u03a6i (~x + \u00ee, ~y )U4 (~x + \u00ee, t)Ui\u2020 (~x, t + 1)U4\u2020 (~x, t)) ,\n\n(3)\n\na\n\nwhere \u03a6i (~x, ~y ) = \u03a9eiTa bi (~x\u2212\u00ee,~y) \u03a9\u2020 , with \u03a9 the gauge transformation which diagonalizes an operator X in the adjoint representation. Ta denote the generators\nof the Cartan subalgebra and ~b the discretized transverse field generated at\nthe lattice spatial point ~x by a magnetic monopole sitting at ~y . We decided to\nwork with the completely random Abelian projection (RAP) [29,30] in which\n5\n\n\fwe do not diagonalize any operator X: it can be thought as a kind of averaging\nover a continuous infinity of Abelian projections. It should be stressed that\nonly the plaquette contribution to the action (1) is modified by the insertion\nof the monopole field and not the chemical potential term. From the definition\nof \u03bc, making use of an iterated change of variables, it can be shown that the\ncorrelation function D(\u2206t) = h\u03bc\u0304(~y , t + \u2206t)\u03bc(~y , t)i describes the creation of a\nmonopole at (~y , t) and its propagation from t to t + \u2206t [26,27,28,29,30]. At\nlarge \u2206t, by cluster property, D(\u2206t) \u2243 A exp(\u2212M\u2206t) + h\u03bci2 . A non-vanishing\nh\u03bci indicates spontaneous breaking of the U(1) magnetic symmetry and hence\ndual superconductivity. In the thermodynamical limit one expects h\u03bci 6= 0\nfor T < Tc , while h\u03bci = 0 for T > Tc if the deconfining phase transition is\nassociated with a transition from a dual superconductor to a trivial vacuum.\n\nAt finite temperature there is no way to put a monopole and an antimonopole\nat large distance along the t-axis as it is done at T = 0, since at T \u223c Tc\nthe temporal extent N\u03c4 a is comparable to the correlation length. Therefore,\none computes h\u03bci but with C \u2217 -periodic boundary conditions in time direction imposed to the numerator in Eq. (2) in order to ensure magnetic charge\nconservation: Ui (~x, N\u03c4 ) = Ui\u2217 (~x, 0), where Ui\u2217 is the complex conjugate of Ui .\nThese boundary conditions have been indicated in Eq. (2) by the index M at\nthe integration measure. They change the sign of the term proportional to \u03c33\nin the links, creating a dislocation with magnetic charge -1 at the boundary\nwhich annihilates the positive magnetic charge created by the operator \u03bc .\nAs a consequence the magnetic charge is conserved and everything is consistent. Of course, the denominator in Eq. (2) is computed using standard\nperiodic boundary conditions. We used links in the fundamental representation, so we implemented exactly the above condition, but an analogous con6\n\n\fdition holds also for link variables defined in the adjoint representation, i.e.\nUi (~x, N\u03c4 ) = (I3 + 2T22)Ui (~x, 0)(I3 + 2T22); charge conjugation is realized in both\nrepresentations through rotations by an angle \u03c0 around the color 2-axis.\nSince h\u03bci is the average of the exponential of a sum over the physical volume,\nit is affected by huge fluctuations which make it difficult to be measured in\nMonte Carlo simulations. A way out is to compute the derivative with respect\nto the coupling parameter \u03b2 \u2261 \u03b2A , which contains all the relevant information\n\u03c1=\n\nd\nlogh\u03bci .\nd\u03b2\n\n(4)\n\nIt is given by the difference between the Wilson plaquette action term h\u03a0i\naveraged with the usual measure and the modified plaquette action term h\u03a0M i\nR\n\naveraged with the modified measure (DU)M e\u2212SM / (DU)M e\u2212SM . The order\nparameter can be reconstructed from\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\nZ\u03b2\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\nh\u03bci = exp \uf8ed \u03c1(\u03b2 \u2032 )d\u03b2 \u2032\uf8f8 .\n0\n\n(5)\n\nEq. (5) tells us that in order to have h\u03bci =\n6 0 in a confined phase, where\nthe dual magnetic symmetry becomes broken, \u03c1 should stay finite for \u03b2 <\n\u03b2c in the thermodynamical limit (i.e. in the limit of spatial lattice extent\nNs \u2192 \u221e), while a sharp negative peak for \u03c1 occuring at \u03b2c and diverging for\nNs \u2192 \u221e should signal the phase transition associated with the restoration of\nthe dual magnetic symmetry. Above the transition a sufficient condition for\nh\u03bci to vanish would be to have \u03c1 \u2192 \u2212\u221e in the thermodynamical limit. In\n[26,27,28,29,30] for the SU(2) case it was argued using perturbation theory\nthat \u03c1 for \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e reaches negative plateau values linearly scaling with Ns . In\n[34] a more detailed numerical analysis has been performed for both SU(2) and\n7\n\n\fSU(3) pure gauge theories, showing that, in the case where \u03bc is magnetically\ncharged, \u03c1 diverges (to negative values) linearly in the weak coupling limit,\nand more and more rapidly as T \u2192 Tc from above, where it diverges as Ns1/\u03bd ,\nthus proving that h\u03bci is strictly zero for every temperature T > Tc , as follows\nfrom Eq. (5). Therefore, when simulating the theory at accessibly large \u03b2\nvalues and lattice sizes, a good criterion for h\u03bci being exactly zero above the\ntransition temperature, is that \u03c1 keeps diverging at least linearly with Ns in\na wide range of \u03b2 values above the transition.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-1000\n\n-500\n\n-2000\n-1000\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c1\n\n-3000\n-4000\n\n-1500\n\n-5000\n\n-2000\n\n-6000\n\n-2500\n\n-7000\n-3000\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\u03b2A\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n0\n\n(a) \u03bb = 0.0\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\u03b2A\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n(b) \u03bb = 0.4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-100\n\n-20\n\n-200\n\n-40\n\n-300\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c1\n\n0.5\n\n-60\n-400\n-80\n\n-500\n\n-100\n\n-600\n-700\n\n-120\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b2A\n\n(c) \u03bb = 0.7\n\n0.6\n\u03b2A\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n(d) \u03bb = 0.8\n\nFig. 2.

First of all we studied the bulk\ntransition (compare with Fig. 1) for some \u03bb-values between 0 (no monopole\nsuppression) and 0.8 (partial monopole suppression) by varying \u03b2A . We do\nthis for finite temperature (N\u03c4 = 4) to investigate the interplay between the\nbulk transition and the finite temperature one. Fig. 2 shows a clear dip at the\nlocation of the bulk transition, in agreement with what was found in previous\nworks with other observables. Although the dip in \u03c1 decreases in magnitude\nwith increasing \u03bb, i.e. as we are suppressing more and more the Z2 monopoles,\nthe lattice artifacts are still present and overshadow the finite temperature\ntransition, assuming the latter exists. Therefore, one cannot yet see neither\nthe scaling of the physical transition with the temperature nor the finite-size\nscaling of the operator with the spatial volume, although one expects that on\nlarge enough lattices the two transitions should decouple also for these values\nof the couplings [21]. Anyway we can conclude that a condensation of U(1)\nmagnetic charges takes place below the bulk transition line.\n\nLet us now turn to the more interesting case of stronger monopole suppression\n(\u03bb = 1.0), where the decoupling of the bulk from the finite temperature transition occurs already at reasonable volumes. Again we vary the temperature\nthrough \u03b2A . We have kept the system fixed in the trivial twist sector so to\ncompare with the results for the adjoint Polyakov loop and the distribution\nof the fundamental Polyakov loop variable in [21]. As one can see from Fig.\n3 (a), at fixed N\u03c4 = 4 the parameter \u03c1 shows a dip around \u03b2A \u2243 1.0 which\nbecomes deeper and deeper with increasing spatial volume. \u03c1 stays finite in\nthe low \u03b2A region as the spatial volume is increased, as can be inferred from\nFig. 3 (c), while the data for high \u03b2A are consistent with its saturation at negative plateau values diverging more than linearly with Ns , as Fig. 3 (d) shows.\n9\n\n\f3\n\nV=4x123\nV=4x16\n3\nV=4x20\n\n0\n\n3\n\nV = 4x123\nV = 4x16\n3\nV = 4x20\n\n-0.4\n-0.5\n-0.6\n1/\u03bd\n\n-0.7\n\n\u03c1/NS\n\n\u03c1\n\n-40\n\n-0.8\n\n-80\n\n\u03bd = 0.63\n\n-0.9\n\nc\n\n\u03b2A = 0.98\n\n-1\n-120\n\n-1.1\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\u03b2A\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n(a)\n\n4\n\n6\n8\n10\n1/\u03bd\nc\nNS (\u03b2A -\u03b2A)\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n(b)\n\n20\n\n-120\n\n3\n\nV=4x12\n3\nV=4x163\nV=4x20\n\n0\n\n3\n\nV=4X12\n3\nV=4X16\n\n-140\n-160\n\n-20\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c1\n\n-180\n-40\n\n-200\n-60\n\n-220\n\n-80\n\n-240\n\n-100\n\n-260\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\n\u03b2A\n\n2.6\n\n2.8\n\n3\n\n\u03b2A\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFig. 3. \u03c1 computed in the trivial twist sector at finite temperature (N\u03c4 = 4) for different values of the spatial volume and for chemical potential \u03bb = 1.0 (a).

The strong and weak coupling regions are highlighted in\n(c) and (d) respectively.\n\nThis gives us clear evidence that also in this case, like for the lattice theory in\nthe fundamental representation, condensation of U(1) magnetic charge takes\nplace below the deconfinement phase transition and disappears above Tc . The\nvacuum is a dual superconductor in the confined phase and becomes trivial in\nthe deconfined one. It shows that the Pisa disorder operator is a meaningful\norder parameter also in a center-blind theory and for fixed twist. Moreover,\n10\n\n\fthe position of the dip is well-consistent with the results found in our previous work [21].

We have also checked the scaling with respect\nto the continuum limit for varying N\u03c4 , making some simulations by fixing\nN\u03c4 = 6 and Ns = 16, 20, 24. As one can see from Fig. 4 (a) the dip occurs\nat a larger \u03b2A value than for N\u03c4 = 4 and becomes again deeper by increasing\nNs , in agreement with a finite temperature phase transition. In this case we\nestimate \u03b2Ac = 1.19. Fig. 4 (b) shows the quality of finite-size scaling assuming\nthe Ising model value for the critical index. Our results are in agreement with\nthe finite-size scaling observed for the specific heat in the Villain action case\nfor N\u03c4 = 2 [10,11,12].\nWe can conclude that our investigation of the modified lattice SO(3) gauge\n11\n\n\ftheory with Wilson action and Z2 monopole suppression using the Pisa disorder operator has confirmed our previous results [21]. Although having restricted to the fixed trivial twist case we find a clear indication for the existence of a finite temperature transition decoupled from the notorious bulk\ntransition. The critical behavior at such a transition reasonably agrees with\nthe critical exponents of the 3D Ising model. The nature of the Pisa disorder\nparameter we used tells us that the transition is related to a condensation\nof U(1) magnetic charges for T < Tc which disappears above the transition,\nproving that the dual superconductor scenario is a good model of confinement\nalso for the adjoint theory. Of course, a final answer can be given only after\nall twist sectors will be taken into account simultaneously. This study is currently under way. Moreover, it would certainly be interesting to compute also\nthe free energy of an (extended) center vortex in order to check how the vortex\ncondensation mechanism works in this case.\nWe thank A.
