In recent years,\nQIT has experienced a steady transition from the realm of the theoretical to that of\nthe practical, and seemingly abstract properties, such as entanglement, can now be\nobserved and, to an extent, manipulated. However, current research is still investigating means to control these elusive quantum properties, which seldom survive the\ntransition from the microscopic to the macroscopic. This thesis examines some of\nthe more fundamental requirements of a successful quantum computation, namely\nthe ability to transmit quantum information with maximum efficiency, and the creation of entanglement. I focus specifically on neutron entanglement, showing that\nthe spins of two or more distinct neutrons can be measurably entangled by forwardscattering from an isotropic medium. This result is of great interest, as inter-neutron\nentanglement has never yet been observed. Furthermore, a mathematical treatment\nof neutron scattering puts forth intriguing questions regarding the interpretation of\n'time' in scattering experiments. Though the problem is by no means new, a unique\nresolution is outstanding. I present a simple treatment based on the Heisenberg\nS-matrix, from which it emerges that in certain situations the quantum-mechanical\ntime parameter appearing in the effective time-evolution operator for the spin system has an intuitive physical interpretation. The final part of the thesis deals with\nquantum information transfer in arrays of permanently coupled dipolar systems. It\nis shown that spin chains with dipolar couplings offer high fidelity long-distance\nstate transmission, but transfer times in unmodulated chains are unfeasibly long.\nPossible optimization methods are discussed, concluding with a review of recent\nachievements in this field.

Ring\n\n200\n\nReferences\n\n202\n\n\fChapter 1\nIntroduction\nIn the past four decades, the evolution of computer hardware has borne out a prediction commonly known as Moore's Law. In its most recent formulation [1], Moore's\nLaw decrees that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles roughly\nevery two years. In a keynote speech delivered earlier this year at the Intel developer\nforum in Shanghai, the senior vice president of Intel technologies stated the trend\nis set to continue for at least another twenty years. By that time, a microprocessor\nno bigger than a few square nanometres will have come to house as many as 1012\ntransistors [2, 3]. Already in the early 1970s, scientists began to realize the implications of this continued miniaturization of computer hardware: microchip transistors\nwould soon be so densely packed as to experience non-negligible intrinsic quantum\nmechanical effects. The idea of a computer whose functioning would rely in a significant way on quantum processes aroused scientists' curiosity: what if all the internal\nprocessing of a computer were to follow quantum laws? Would such a machine have\nany advantage over a classical computer? How could it be built?\nOne of the first to address these issues was Richard Feynman. During a conference\nat Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1981, Feynman observed that\na classical computer could not efficiently simulate the evolution of a quantum system, and proposed a basic model of quantum \"simulator\" that would overcome this\nlimitation. Feynman's ideas were formalized by David Deutsch, who in the seminal\npaper \"Quantum Theory, the Church-Turing Principle and the Universal Quantum\nComputer\"[4] provided a more comprehensive description of a quantum computer's\n8\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\n\n9\n\nfeatures and capabilities. In comparing a quantum computer to a classical machine,\nDeutsch stated:\n\n... [the universal quantum computer] admits a further class of programs\nwhich evolve computational basis states into linear superpositions of each\nother.\n\nThis is, in fact, the defining feature of a quantum computer: the ability to manipulate data that is not in an eigenstate of the computational basis. Whereas classical\nbits can exist only in the states 0 or 1, quantum bits (or qubits), can be found in\nsuperpositions of the form \u03b1|0i+\u03b2|1i, where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are real or complex coefficients\nsatisfying the condition |\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2 = 1. Consequently, a quantum computer of N\nregisters can exist in a superposition of 2N possible states, which greatly increases\nits computing power compared to a classical computer of the same size. Consider,\nfor example, a function of many variables, f (x1 , x2 ...xn ), with xn = [0, 1]. This\nfunction is defined constant if it is single-valued for all permutations of {x1 , x2 ...xn },\nand balanced if its value is 0 for half of the input domain and 1 for the other half.\nClassically, the characterization of the function might require 2(n\u22121) + 1 evaluations.\nWith a quantum computer, just one evaluation is enough to give an answer that is\nalways correct. The quantum algorithm that achieves this is known as the DeutschJosza algorithm, and was proposed by Deutsch, in collaboration with Richard Josza,\nin 1992 [5].\nTwo years later, Peter Shor of Bell Labs discovered a remarkable algorithm that\nwould allow large integers to be factored very quickly, thus invalidating even the\nmost secure public-key cryptosystems available at the time [6]. Arriving as it did\nin a period of intense debate on the individual's right to absolute privacy of communication, Shor's discovery sparked a huge interest in quantum computation and\nkick-started some truly outstanding progress in the field. The very next year, a\ngroup at NIST (Colorado) succeeded in making the first quantum logic gate with\ntrapped ions, according to a proposal advanced previously by Cirac and Zoller of\nInnsbruck University [7, 8]. In 1996 Lov Grover of Bell Labs developed an algorithm\nthat would allow the quadratic speed up of a database search [9], and 1997 brought\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\n\n10\n\nthe first publications on quantum simulation using liquid-state nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR) techniques, by Cory, Chuang et al. of MIT [10]. The following\nyear, two independent groups at MIT and Oxford University succeeded in building\nthe first two-qubit NMR quantum computers, and executed the Deutsch-Josza algorithm and Grover's algorithm for a database with four entries [11, 12, 13]. The\nnew millennium saw the construction of five- and seven-qubit NMR computers, and\nin 2001 researchers at IBM's Almaden Research Centre and Stanford University implemented Shor's algorithm to factor the number 15 on a 7-qubit NMR computer\n[14].\nThe appearance of a working quantum computer less than fifteen years after its\n'official' conception was a truly impressive achievement, greatly owed to a backup\nof almost five decades of work in the field of magnetic resonance. However, it was\nsoon realized that NMR quantum computing would become unfeasible for systems\nof more than 10 qubits, which is considerably fewer than the number required for\nany truly interesting application. As a result, the focus of the scientific community\nlargely shifted to other QC strategies, and some of the most popular proposals\ncurrently include trapped ions, superconducting Josephson junctions, charge states\nof quantum dots, and atoms trapped in optical potentials, usually referred to as\noptical lattices. The past few years have yielded numerous achievements in all these\nfields, but current research is still grappling with issues such as qubit generation,\nmanipulation and stability, as well as reliable data storage and transfer.\nThis thesis proposes to examine some of the more fundamental requirements of a successful quantum computation, namely the ability to transmit quantum information\nwith maximum efficiency, and the creation of entanglement, a stronger-than-classical\nquantum correlation that many believe embodies 'quantumness' itself. I will begin\nwith a discussion of this intriguing phenomenon, describing in a mainly qualitative\nfashion its principal properties and its role in quantum computation and communication. Experimental achievements will be reviewed, and possible 'gaps in the\nmarket' will be identified. Chapter 3 attempts to fill one such gap by proposing\nan original scheme to generate entanglement between distinct neutrons, which has\nnever been observed to date. The entanglement arises from the sequential scattering of a neutron pair from a macroscopic substrate, which is described using a\nfully time-dependent approach based on unitary evolution. This somewhat atypical\ntreatment of the scattering problem raises the question of the physical interpreta-\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\n\n11\n\ntion of the quantum-mechanical time parameter, and a detailed comparison with\nstandard scattering theory reveals interesting, and often pleasingly simple results.\nFollowing a discussion of this point in chapter 4, the performance of the protocol will\nbe assessed in chapter 5, together with experimental requirements and feasibility in\nlight of methods and instrumentation currently at our disposal. Chapter 6 then describes an extension of the scheme, which allows for greater experimental flexibility.\nIn chapter 7, the focus shifts slightly from entanglement generation to entanglement\ndistribution by transmission of arbitrary quantum states. The discussion will hinge\non quantum communication using spin chains, remarkable yet simple systems identified some years ago as potentially faithful carriers of quantum information. I will\nreview the original proposal for quantum state transfer through nearest-neighbourcoupled Heisenberg spin chains, and present a new model for near-perfect spin chain\ncommunication based on long-range dipolar interactions in chapter 8. Finally, chapter 9 is dedicated to a short summary and discussion of the main results of this\nthesis, together with a vision for improvements, extensions and future avenues of\ninvestigation.\n\n\fChapter 2\nThe Role of Entanglement\nThis chapter introduces quantum entanglement, a property identified by Schr\u00f6dinger\nin the mid 1930's as the very embodiment of 'quantumness' itself. After a brief\nhistorical note, I will illustrate the main properties of entangled states and the\nconcept of an 'entanglement measure', a theoretical tool used to quantify entanglement and study its dynamics. Entanglement generation schemes will be reviewed,\nwith particular emphasis on long-distance entanglement via ancillary mediators. I\nwill discuss detection of entangled states using witnesses, and current experimental\nachievements, concluding with a few personal remarks on the ontological value of\nunderstanding what Einstein called 'spooky action at a distance'.\n\n2.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe act of communication between two parties can be interpreted as a movement of\ninformation from one to the other. This information somehow links the two parties,\nhence a successful communication fulfils the objective of establishing a correlation\nbetween a sender and a receiver. In the quantum world, this correlation has rather\npeculiar properties, and upon close analysis raises questions that stray from the\nrealm of physics into that of philosophy. We are speaking, of course, of entanglement.\nFrom an operational viewpoint, entanglement is a physical resource, which enables\nfaithful communication of quantum information and is believed by many to fuel\n12\n\n\fChapter 2. The Role of Entanglement\n\n13\n\nthe power of quantum computation ([15, 16, 17] and references therein). Entangled\nquantum systems share a stronger-than-classical correlation, such that a measurement on one will instantaneously project the other into a state conditional on the\noutcome of that measurement, even if they are separated by a space-like interval.\nIn the words of Schr\u00f6dinger himself [18]:\nWhen two systems, of which we know the states by their respective\nrepresentatives, enter into temporary physical interaction due to known\nforces between them, and [...] separate again, then they can no longer be\ndescribed [...] by endowing each of them with a representative of its own\n[...] By the interaction the two representatives have become entangled.\n[...] even though we restrict the disentangling measurements to one system, the representative obtained for the other system is by no means\nindependent of the particular choice of observations which we select for\nthat purpose and which by the way are entirely arbitrary. It is rather\ndiscomforting that the theory should allow a system to be steered or\npiloted into one or the other type of state at the experimenter's mercy\nin spite of his having no access to it.\nSchr\u00f6dinger's discomfort stemmed from the apparent conflict between the predictions of quantum mechanics and the reigning opinion that a complete physical theory\nshould be local and realistic [19]. According to such a theory, (i) a measurement\nmade at one point in space should not be influenced by anything outside its past\nlight cone; (ii) physical properties should have a well-defined value whether they are\nmeasured or not. It is believed Einstein once said, \"I like to think that the moon is\nthere even if I am not looking at it\" [20]. The idea that observations made on one\nparty of a entangled pair could instantaneously project the other into a well-defined\nquantum state contradicts both these axioms, suggesting (i) that faster than light\ncommunication is possible, and (ii) that physical quantities lack objective reality.\nQuantum mechanics was therefore deemed incomplete, and local 'hidden variable'\n(LHV) models were proposed to explain the manifestation of this 'spooky action at a\ndistance'. After many years of heated debate, British physicist John Bell concluded\nthat empirical evidence alone would resolve the controversy, and in 1966 published\ndetails of an experiment designed to test the deterministic world view [21]. The key\nresult of this publication was a measurable inequality, derived independently of any\n\n\fChapter 2. The Role of Entanglement\n\n14\n\ntype of mathematical formalism, which should be respected by any LHV. A more\ngeneral version of Bell's inequality was measured for the first time in the 1980s in\na series of experiments by Aspect et al., whose results conclusively precluded the\nexistence of local hidden variables, therefore ascribing to quantum mechanics the\ncharacteristics of a non-local theory [22]. The overwhelming majority of Bell's test\nexperiments carried out since have reached similar conclusions [23]; however, there\nremain shadows of uncertainty owing to the possibility of 'loopholes', which arise\nfrom the need to make assumptions about the experimental setup [24]1 .\nEntangled states have many interesting properties. It has recently been shown that\nentangled particles may signal to each other more than 10000 times faster than the\nspeed of light [25]. Luckily for special relativity, this does not imply super-luminal\ncommunication, because the signal cannot be used to send a message. For this to\nbe possible, control over a measurement outcome is required - but this outcome\nis always probabilistic. Indeed, the information carried by a maximally entangled\nstate relates to the whole rather than the components, which are individually in\nmaximally mixed states. This property can be phrased in terms of entropy, in that\nthe state of the whole is always more ordered than that of the subsystems [26].\nThe operational capabilities of entangled states can then be expressed as entropic\ninequalities which show, for example, that if two parties share a maximally entangled\nstate and a classical channel, each party can arrive at full knowledge of the state\nwithout any further exchange of qubits [27].\nEntanglement is perhaps best appreciated in the context of quantum computation.\nIt is believed that entanglement is, at least partly, responsible for the exponential\nspeedup of a quantum process over a classical one. It has been shown that an arbitrary quantum computation requires exponentially higher resource overheads if\nentanglement is not involved [15, 16, 17]. This view is upheld by the fact that many\nquantum algorithms, such as Shor's factorization and Grover's search, rely on the\nproduction of highly entangled intermediate states [28, 29]. Sophisticated quantum\nsearch (SQS) algorithms capable of outperforming a classical algorithm without recourse to entanglement have been suggested; however, it has also been observed\nthat equally efficient classical versions of SQS exist, therefore no true advantage\n1\n\nAn example is the 'fair sampling' assumption, which relates to optical realizations of the\nexperiment, and states that the number of photons reaching a detector is representative of the\nnumber of photons emitted by the source.\n\n\f15\n\nChapter 2. The Role of Entanglement\n\nover classical computation can be claimed [30, 31]. Simulations of quantum systems\nalso rely on entanglement, because not all quantum processes can be reproduced by\na classical computer. In some exceptional cases, highly entangled quantum computations can be efficiently simulated by classical means [32, 33, 34]. However, as a\ngeneral rule, this is not possible unless the amount of entanglement present in the\nsystem does not exceed k log n, where k > 0 and n is the number of input qubits\n[15, 35].\nEntanglement is by no means a comprehensively understood phenomenon, however\ndespite its more esoteric characteristics it is now well established as a real physical resource. Unfortunately, entanglement is often somewhat fragile, and can be\ndiminished or destroyed if the entangled systems experience contact with a noisy\nenvironment. Much of today's entanglement theory comes from attempts to preserve\nthe precious correlations, by determining how entanglement can be created, manipulated and quantified. Bi-partite entanglement is well understood and, now, accessible from an experimental viewpoint also. The field of multi-partite entanglement\ncharacterization is currently one of ever expanding horizons, strongly motivated by\nrecent observations of three- to eight-party entangled states [36].\n\n2.2\n\nFundamental Properties\n\nThe main property of an entangled state is that its component subsystems are no\nlonger independent. Formally, this means an entangled n-party state \u03c1 cannot be\nwritten as a mixture of separable states, i.e.\n\u03c1A,B...N 6=\n\nX\n\npi \u03c1i ,\n\n(2.1)\n\ni\n\nwith\n\u03c1i = \u03c1A\ni\n\nO\n\n\u03c1B\ni\n\nO\n\n* * * \u03c1N\ni .\n\n(2.2)\n\nIt follows that all tensor product (or separable) states contain no entanglement, while\nall non-separable states are entangled, and therefore allow some tasks to be achieved\nbetter than by local operations and classical communication (LOCC) alone [37, 38].\nSeparable states can evolve into entangled states, however this requires non-local\n\n\fChapter 2. The Role of Entanglement\n\n16\n\noperations such as two-qubit gates or interaction with ancillary systems. Indeed,\nthe total entanglement of an n-party state cannot increase under LOCC alone [39].\nThis goes back to entropy, as there exist theorems stating that a pure state \u03c8 can\nonly be transformed into another \u03c6 if the subsystems of \u03c8 are less ordered than those\nof \u03c6 [38, 40]. Therefore, as the entanglement of a state is directly proportional to the\nentropy of its subsystems, a locally ordered, separable state cannot be transformed\ninto a locally disordered entangled state. LOCC can however change the distribution\nof entanglement within a many-particle system; this property enables protocols such\nas quantum teleportation and quantum dense coding, which allow Alice to transmit\na message to Bob by performing local measurements on her half of a previously\nshared entangled state [41, 42]. It has also been shown there exists a special class\nof entangled states that increase the scope of LOCC if employed as ancillae. These\nare called bound entangled states, sometimes referred to as 'activators', owing to\ntheir ability to facilitate entanglement-boosting protocols such as distillation. An\ninteresting result is that any bipartite pure state can be transformed into another\nby LOCC alone, provided one has access to bound-entangled states [37, 43, 44, 45].\nThe invariance of entanglement under LOCC can be related to a property known\nas entanglement monogamy [46]. According to this property, there is a limit on the\namount of information a particle can share with others. If a particle is maximally\nentangled with another, its entanglement with any other system must be zero. This\nis owed to the fact that a maximally entangled state contains all the information\navailable on that state; there is none left to share with other parties. If, on the other\nhand, two particles are only partly entangled, correlations with other parties are\nallowed. The bound on the amount of entanglement between any pair of particles of\na multiparty state has recently been formalized in terms of an entanglement measure\nknown as the tangle, which will be introduced in the following section.\n\n2.3\n\nMeasures\n\nAnalyzing the entanglement of a quantum state can mean several things. On the one\nhand, one could be content with establishing whether the state is in fact entangled or\nseparable. For bipartite systems whose dimensions d do not exceed 6, this is easily\ndecided via a criterion known as the Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) [47, 48].\n\n\fChapter 2. The Role of Entanglement\n\n17\n\nThe criterion states that if the eigenvalue spectrum of a state \u03c1AB becomes negative\nunder partial transposition with respect to either system, the state is entangled. This\ndoes not mean a state with positive partial transpose is necessarily separable; the\naforementioned activator states, for example, are entangled states with PPT. The\nsituation becomes more complicated for multipartite states; in this case, the PPT\ncriterion can tell us whether any two parties are entangled, but not whether genuine\nmultipartite entanglement exists. It is, therefore, often simpler to quantify the\nentanglement of a state via ad hoc functions known as entanglement measures. Not\nall measures have the same operational meaning, therefore different entanglement\nmeasures can afford different state ordering. Calculating a spectrum of entanglement\nmeasures for a given state can then provide a useful means of characterization.\nEntanglement measures E satisfy the following fundamental axioms:\n1. E(\u03c1) = 0 if \u03c1 is separable;\n2. E(\u03c1) does not increase over LOCC, and is therefore an entanglement monotone.\nAs regards pure states, the best known and most commonly used entanglement\nmeasure is the Von Neumann Entropy, defined as\n\u0002\n\u0003\nS(\u03c1) = \u2212TrA (B) \u03c1A (B) log2 \u03c1A (B) .\n\n(2.3)\n\nThis is the quantum equivalent of the Shannon entropy, which measures the uncertainty associated with a classical probability distribution [49]. In the context of\npure-state entanglement, S (\u03c1) represents something of a 'reference', as all entanglement measures E(\u03c1) must reduce to S(\u03c1) if \u03c1 is pure.\nIn more general terms, any function that adheres to the two conditions listed above is\na valid entanglement measure. Therefore, the set of measures is in principle infinite\n[50]. However, for reasons of mathematical convenience, it is often useful to choose\nfunctions which satisfy more specific conditions [38], for example:\n1. Normalization: E(\u03c1) = 1 if \u03c1 is a Bell state, or related to a Bell state by a\nlocal unitary transformation;\n\n\f18\n\nChapter 2. The Role of Entanglement\n\nP\n2. Convexity: For a mixed state \u03c1 = i pi \u03c1i , where the pi are the weights of the\ndifferent \u03c1i components, an entanglement measure is convex if\nE\n\nX\ni\n\npi \u03c1i\n\n!\n\n\u2264\n\nX\n\npi E (\u03c1i ) .\n\n(2.4)\n\ni\n\nSome entanglement measures have an operational definition, others are constructed\non the basis of the above axioms, and not all have a physical interpretation. The brief\nsummary that follows is intended as a largely qualitative overview rather than an\nexhaustive and mathematically detailed discussion, as I have focussed on measures\nthat are either relevant to the present work or have an intuitive physical interpretation. I refer the reader to [38, 51] and references therein for a more comprehensive\nand fully mathematical treatment.\nThe Distillable Entanglement Entanglement distillation (or concentration) is\nan entanglement purification protocol whereby Alice and Bob share n copies\nof an entangled state \u03c1, perform LOCC and obtain k < n copies of a Bell\nstate [52]. The distillable entanglement is defined as the optimal ratio k/n\nyielded by this process in the limit of large n. It is interesting to note that all\nentangled bipartite states can be distilled, however this may require the help\nof an activator state. Activator states, on the other hand, cannot be distilled;\ntheir entanglement is inaccessible, hence the term 'bound entanglement'.\nThe Entanglement Cost represents the number of singlet states n one has to\nshare to distill an arbitrary state, such that errors become infinitesimal in the\nlimit of large n [52]. It is therefore defined in relation to a process which is\nthe opposite of distillation.\nThe Entanglement of Formation was introduced in the context of entanglement purification, with the principal objective of quantifying the entanglement\nof mixed states, i.e. states which are a mixture of entangled pure states [39].\nThe entanglement of formation is then defined as the minimal average entanglement over all pure state decompositions. In a two-qubit system, this can\nbe calculated exactly from a second quantity, the concurrence [53], defined as\nC(\u03c1) = max{0, \u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb3 \u2212 \u03bb4 }.\n\n(2.5)\n\n\f19\n\nChapter 2. The Role of Entanglement\n\nTaking \u03c1 to be the density matrix of the two qubits, the \u03bbi are the eigenp\u221a \u221a\n\u03c1\u03c1\u0303 \u03c1, which has \u03c1\u0303 =\nvalues in decreasing order of the matrix R =\nN\nN\n\u03c3y ) and\n\u03c3y )\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c3y\n(\u03c3y\n\u03c3y =\n\n0 \u2212i\ni 0\n\n!\n\n,\n\nwhere \u03c1\u2217 is the element-by-element complex conjugate of \u03c1.\nThe Logarithmic Negativity A bipartite state is entangled if it has a negative\npartial transpose. The magnitude of the negative eigenvalue can be related to\nthe degree of entanglement using the logarithmic negativity [54, 55], defined\nas\nEN (\u03c1) = log2 ||\u03c1TB ||\n(2.6)\n\u221a\nwhere ||X|| = T r X \u2020 X, and TB indicates the partial transpose with respect\nto qubit B.\nThe Robustness of Entanglement This quantifies how much noise it is possible\nto mix in with a given entangled state before it becomes separable [56].\nThe Squashed Entanglement is related to the intrinsic information, which measures the correlations between two discrete random variables whose value is\nconditioned by a third [57]. It is proportional to the minimal quantum intrinsic\ninformation over all states \u03c1ABC satisfying TrC \u03c1ABC = \u03c1AB :\n1\nEsq = inf {\u03c1ABC } [S(AC) + S(BC) \u2212 S(ABC) \u2212 S(C)] ,\n2\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere S (*) is the Von-Neumann entropy. The squashed entanglement is related to the distillable entanglement and the entanglement of formation, as\nED \u2264 Esq \u2264 EF .\nStrictly, the above quantities relate to bipartite entanglement only, though multipartite generalizations can sometimes be derived. An example is the 'global entanglement' [58], which is simply the sum of the pairwise concurrences of a many qubit\nstate. The squashed entanglement can also be extended to many particle states\nby replacing the bipartite mutual information with its equivalent for multipartite\nsystems [59].\n\n\f20\n\nChapter 2. The Role of Entanglement\n\nA commonly used measure is the tangle \u03c4 [46], defined for three qubits as\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c4 (A, B, C) = CA,\nBC \u2212 CA, B \u2212 CA, C ,\n\n(2.8)\n\n2\nwhere C is the concurrence. It has been shown that CA,\nBC = 4 det \u03c1A , where \u03c1A\nis the reduced density matrix of the first subsystem. This is owed to the fact that\nthe pair BC can be viewed as a 'unit'; therefore, the four-dimensional subspace\n\nof BC effectively becomes two-dimensional. The tangle is then the entanglement\nbetween system A and the unit BC which is not accounted for by the separate\nentanglements of A with B and C individually. This is sometimes referred to as the\n'residual entanglement'. In its original context, the tangle was used to define the\nmonogamy inequality for three qubits\n2\n2\n2\nCA,\nBC \u2265 CA, B + CA, C .\n\n(2.9)\n\nRecently, this has been generalized to m-qubit systems [60]. One then has\nC1,2 2 + * * * + C1,2 m \u2264 C1,2 (2,***m) ,\n\n(2.10)\n\nhence the entanglement of one qubit with all the others individually cannot exceed\nthe entanglement of that qubit with the others taken as a block. The quantity\n2\nC1,2 (2,***m) is defined in analogy to CA,\nBC via the so called convex roof construction\n\n[61]. Taking qubits {2, m} to represent a 2(m\u22121) -dimensional system B, one finds\nC1,2 B , inf {px , \u03c8x }\n\nX\n\npx S(TrB \u03c1\u03c8x ),\n\n(2.11)\n\nx\n\nwhere the infimum runs over all pure state decompositions of \u03c11 B =\nyielded by the pure state \u03c8x .\n\nP\n\nx\n\npx \u03c1\u03c8x\n\nAnother interesting measure, showing some formal similarities to the bipartite entanglement of formation, has been defined in the context of spin chains. This is the\nlocalisable entanglement [62], and represents the maximum bipartite entanglement\none can obtain by choosing two subsystems of a multipartite entangled state and\nperforming LOCC to optimize their correlation. For three qubit states, the localisable entanglement is equivalent to the so-called entanglement of assistance, i.e. the\namount of entanglement Alice and Bob can establish between their qubits if Charlie\n\n\fChapter 2. The Role of Entanglement\n\n21\n\nmeasures his and communicates the outcome [63].\nFor reasons of relevance and brevity I shall stop here, although the above is by no\nmeans an exhaustive list. For a comprehensive discussion, I once more refer the\nreader to [38, 51] and references therein.\n\n2.4\n\nWitnesses\n\nEntanglement measures provide a theoretical characterization of entanglement dynamics, but cannot be measured directly because they do not represent observables.\nTo verify the entanglement of a system in an experimental setting, it is therefore\nuseful to define a set of hermitian operators termed entanglement witnesses [48, 64],\nwhose expectation values represent average values of measurable quantities, i.e. observable properties of a physical systems. A valid entanglement witness must satisfy\nhW i = Tr [W \u03c1AB ] > 0\n\n(2.12)\n\nif \u03c1AB is separable, hence the expectation value of a witness must be positive on all\nproduct states. A witness therefore provides an experimentally accessible means of\nestablishing whether a state is entangled or not.\nThe estimation of the entanglement properties of a system from expectation value\nmeasurements bears an interesting relation to the Jaynes maximum entropy principle\n[65]. It is known that the state of a system is completely characterized by the\nensemble of the expectation values of all commuting observables relating to that\nstate. Suppose, however, that one disposed of an incomplete data set which did\nnot allow a unique characterization; the Jaynes principle affirms that, of all possible\nstates of the system, the most probable one is that which maximizes entropy. Let us\nnow imagine we hold an incomplete data set relating to some quantum state; what\ncould we infer about its entanglement properties? According to the Jaynes principle,\nif the data set is compatible with a range of entanglements \u01eb \u2208 [\u01eb\u2212 , \u01eb+ ], one should\n\nalways assume \u01eb = \u01eb+ . This is due to the correspondence between entanglement and\nentropy discussed above. However, it has been shown that such a maximization is not\nalways 'truthful'; in other words, by applying the Jaynes principle to quantum states\none runs the risk of overestimating the amount of entanglement at one's disposal\n\n\fChapter 2. The Role of Entanglement\n\n22\n\n[66]. It has therefore been suggested that in a quantum setting one should apply\nminimization of entanglement under experimental constraints. In other words, if\nan incomplete data set is compatible with the range of entanglements \u01eb \u2208 [\u01eb\u2212 , \u01eb+ ],\n\none should always assume the true entanglement of the system is represented by the\nlower bound.\n\nWitness operators can be ordered by the entanglement they detect. A witness is\nfiner than another if it detects more entanglement, and is termed optimal if no finer\nwitness exists, i.e. if it detects all the entanglement of a given state. Witnesses are\nusually represented by a combination of observables, rather than a single one. As the\nmeasurement of each component of the witness typically requires a different setting\nof the laboratory apparatus, much effort is dedicated to finding optimal witnesses\nthat can be measured with a minimal number of device settings. This problem is\nsometimes referred to as 'finding the optimal decomposition' [67, 68]. Constructing\na witness capable of detecting the entanglement of an arbitrary state is generally\nan arduous task. However, the problem simplifies greatly if one has some a priori\nknowledge of the structure of the target state. In this case, it is possible to define\nwitnesses that are measurable with as few as three device settings [67].\nIn practise, the spectrum of measurable witnesses for a given system is restricted by\nexperimental constraints. However, witnesses find application as theoretical tools\nalso, because for any valid witness W , condition (2.12) provides a separability criterion. Conditions such as (2.12) are known as linear separability criteria, because\nonly the first power of the expectation value of the witness appears. Non-linear\ncriteria feature higher powers of hW i. Typical examples involve the uncertainties\nassociated with measurements of local variables, expressed in terms of the variance,\nwhich is a quadratic function of the expectation value [69, 70].\n\n2.5\n\nEntanglement Generation\n\nA vast proportion of all research in quantum computation and communication relates\nto entanglement generation and control, with a view to find experimentally feasible\nways of producing robust entanglement on demand. Nearby qubits are best entangled via two-qubit gates; however, gating operations become inefficient on distant\n\n\fChapter 2. The Role of Entanglement\n\n23\n\nqubits, whose direct coupling is usually extremely weak. This problem represents\none of the main obstacles to upscaling current devices, and has therefore been looked\ninto by several authors. Many existing proposals for creating long distance entanglement rely on single- or two-photon interference effects [71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76]. In these\ntypes of schemes, distant qubits are entangled via the detection of photons resulting from their radiative decay2 . Recently, however, the focus seems to have shifted\nsomewhat to the alternative scenario of employing entanglement mediators. These\nare ancillary qubits, made to interact successively with two non-communicating\nqubits A and B; the entanglement between A and B arises when measurements on\nthese ancillae are made. Various ways to implement this idea have been proposed\n[77, 78, 79, 80]. In [77], for example, the authors describe an experiment to entangle two optical cavities by repeated interaction with a mediator. The success\nof the scheme is shown to depend on the interaction times and strengths, and on\nthe measurement of the mediator. Yuasa and Nakazato [78] build on this scheme\nto demonstrate that maximally entangled states can be created by three successive\ninteractions of identical mediators with the cavities, provided one assumes rotating\nwave couplings of a specific strength, acting for specific times. In later work, the\nsame authors find that repeated resonant scattering of a mediator also generates\nmaximal entanglement, particularly if the momentum of the mediator can be fixed\nto a desired value [79]. Costa et al. have analyzed the more complex scenario of\nan injected electron being spatially scattered by two spin- 21 magnetic impurities in\na one-dimensional, non-magnetic, metallic chain. In this case, it was found that the\nelectron could almost perfectly entangle the impurities, conditional to a favourable\n(and reasonably probable) outcome of a measurement on the electron's spin.\nVery recently, some authors have been investigating the issue of entanglement on a\nmacroscopic scale [81, 82, 83], with a view to underline that:\n... entanglement is not an artificial mathematical property but [..] can be\nextracted and therefore used for quantum information processing in the\nsame way as heat can be extracted and used for work in thermodynamics\n[81].\nThe situation described in [81] is that of two probe particles simultaneously scatter2\n\nThe entanglement arises because it is impossible to trace the provenance of the individual\nphotons, hence the qubits are left in a superposition of ground and excited state.\n\n\fChapter 2. The Role of Entanglement\n\n24\n\ning from two entangled spins in a solid. It is shown that the amount of entanglement\nextractable from the solid depends mainly on the interaction Hamiltonian and the\njoint state of the spins.\nAnother interesting proposal is that described by Cunha and Vedral [82]. This builds\non previous work by the same authors, in which the Pauli principle is invoked as\na means to create entanglement between fermions in a degenerate Fermi gas. Because fermions only have spatial and spin degrees of freedom, it is argued that if\ntwo fermions were simultaneously detected at the same position, their spin degrees\nof freedom would necessarily be entangled. The authors show this entanglement\npersists provided the fermions remain within a certain distance of each other. The\nentanglement distance is found to be inversely proportional to the Fermi wavevector\nkF , which imposes constraints on the type of fermion one could use for an experimental verification of this scheme. The setup described involves a vessel containing\nultracold neutrons, with a small hole. The authors suggest that provided certain\nprecautions are observed in preparing the Fermi gas, the neutrons emitted from this\nhole within a given time interval of each other will be entangled. The scheme is\nsimple and efficient, however an experimental realization would be extremely challenging, owing to the difficulty of preparing a Fermi gas of neutrons in a laboratory\nenvironment.\nThe Pauli principle is used as a means to create entanglement also in [83]. Here,\nthe authors consider two electrons with opposite momenta and spin, trapped in a\npotential well inside an optical cavity. Two independent photons with orthogonal\npolarizations are fired into the cavity, creating two excited electrons with different\nspin and momenta. The electrons are made to interact with some external energy\nabsorbing reservoir, which \"drags\" them into the same zero-momentum state, causing their spins to become entangled. The entangled electrons then decay according\nto well-defined selection rules, emitting spin-polarized entangled photons. Interestingly, the dissipative interaction with the environment is essential to the success of\nthe scheme, because the photons become entangled only if the electrons' momenta\nare equal. This is ensured by the dissipative interaction with the environment, hence\ndecoherence is quite surprisingly viewed as a 'pro' rather than a 'con'.\n\n\fChapter 2. The Role of Entanglement\n\n2.6\n\n25\n\nExperimental Achievements\n\nThe study of entanglement was in origin a largely theoretical enterprise. The advancement of experimental prowess in the past few years now means the scientific\ncommunity is poised to mount a two-pronged attack on the subject: theory tells us\nwhat we should see, experiment tells us what we do see. Attempting to reconcile\nthe two produces a positive feedback, whence an understanding of the relationship\nbetween the microscopic and macroscopic world is born.\nRecent experimental studies of entanglement generation have pursued two main\nobjectives. On the one hand, great effort has been dedicated to the realization of\nmany-particle entangled states. These are essential to measurement-based quantum\ncomputation with graph or cluster states [84], which provides an alternative to the\nmore widespread gate model. Achievements in this area include the realization of\nfour- to eight-ion W-states [36], four-ion [85], five-photon [86] and three-atom [87]\nGHZ states .\nMuch research is also directed at sourcing novel systems to entangle. Indeed, entangled particles are not only at the heart of quantum computation and communication, but also find application in more fundamental areas, such as investigating the\nnon-locality and non-contextuality of quantum mechanics. Photons, ions, atoms,\nquantum dots [88] and superconducting qubits [89] are all demonstrably feasible\npossibilities, but neutrons, for example, have never been entangled [90, 91] - an issue this thesis will attempt to address. An area of rapidly growing interest is that of\nsingle-particle entanglement [92], which involves entangling distinct degrees of freedom of the same particle. Systems of this type clearly cannot exhibit non-locality,\nthough non-contextual behaviour has been observed for both single neutrons and\nsingle photons [90, 93]. One of the most impressive achievements to date involves\nthe creation of a three-way entangled GHZ-type state of a single neutron, the three\n'qubits' being the spatial and spin parts of the neutron's wavefunction, and its energy\n[91].\n\n\fChapter 2. The Role of Entanglement\n\n2.7\n\n26\n\nConclusions\n\nThe study of entanglement occupies a prime position in the field of quantum information processing. From a practical viewpoint, it is clear that generating and\npreserving entanglement in a controllable fashion are paramount to building quantum computers that rival existing classical machines. In addition, entanglement is\na probe of nature, given its potential to reveal whether the world around us has\nobjective reality or whether, to paraphrase slightly, reality is in the eye of the beholder. Finally, entanglement is a probe of 'quantumness', because it is destroyed by\ncontact with the macroscopic. I believe the practical and fundamental aspects are\nclosely interwoven: to use a resource to its full potential, one must first understand\nits properties. However, if cracking an RSA-encrypted message and understanding\n'life, the universe and everything' truly are two sides of the same coin, I'd place\nstrong odds on achieving the former before the latter.\n\n\fChapter 3\nA Novel Proposal for Neutron\nEntanglement\nIn this chapter, I put forward a proposal for a scattering experiment aimed at achieving entanglement between two distinct neutrons. This has never been accomplished to\ndate; indeed, neutron entanglement has only been observed between distinct degrees\nof freedom of single particles. The realization of entangled states of two neutrons is\ntherefore a highly desirable objective, and would open up the possibility of testing the\nnon-local nature of quantum mechanics with an as yet untapped resource. After a\ngeneral overview of neutron scattering as an experimental technique, I will describe\nthe protocol, and discuss the assumptions and approximations underlying it. In the\nconcluding part of the chapter, I outline the mathematical formalism employed to\nmodel the experiment, and comment on its relationship to the traditional approach\nto scattering problems, which will be treated in detail in the next chapter.\n\n3.1\n1\n\nNeutrons and Scattering\n\nA great deal of our current understanding of the structure and dynamical proper-\n\nties of matter comes from neutron scattering. This technique, originally developed\nto further the study of condensed matter physics and crystallography, now finds\n1\n\nThe majority of this material was obtained from [94].\n\n27\n\n\fChapter 3. A Novel Proposal for Neutron Entanglement\n\n28\n\napplication in the most diverse areas of science, including biology, nanotechnology\nand planetary science.\nNeutrons are chargeless particles which, together with protons, form atomic nuclei.\nThe standard model of particle physics classifies them as baryons, the subclass of\nhadrons composed of three quarks - two down and one up in this specific case. Free\nneutrons are unstable, and have a typical lifetime of the order of 15 minutes, after\nwhich they decay into a proton, an electron and a neutrino. Scattering events are\nusually concluded well within this time frame. Owing to the absence of charge,\nneutrons are largely insensitive to stray electric fields and surface defects, and do\nnot themselves create fields capable of disturbing the environment of the scatterer.\nConsequently, neutrons are excellent non-destructive probes both of surface and\nbulk properties of matter, and can be used to study samples immersed in complex\nenvironments [95].\nTypical scattering experiments are aimed at the characterization of a sample. For\nreasons that go back to wave-particle duality, this is achieved by analyzing the momentum distribution of the outgoing neutrons. Indeed, the neutron scatters as a\nwave but is detected as a particle. The De Broglie wavelength of a neutron is determined by its energy; so-called thermal neutrons have wavelengths comparable to\ninteratomic spacings, and can therefore penetrate bulk materials. The energy of a\nthermal neutron is of order O (10\u22123 ) eV, which is similar to the energy scales of\nelementary acoustic or magnetic excitations (phonons and magnons). Momentum\nchanges of scattered neutrons can then be used to map dispersion curves for lattice\nvibrations and spin fluctuations. Elastic scattering, on the other hand, provides\ninformation on the structural properties of the sample, and, on a more fundamental\nlevel, on the optical potential that couples nucleons to nuclei and to each other.\nFinally, if the resolution of the experiment is sufficient to distinguish elastic and inelastic processes, scattering can also identify whether or not the sample is entangled\n[96].\n\n\fChapter 3. A Novel Proposal for Neutron Entanglement\n\n29\n\nFigure 3.1: A visual description of neutron scattering as an experimental technique. Image reproduced with kind permission of Professor Sunil K. Sinha, University of California San Diego and\nLos Alamos National Laboratory.\n\nThe interaction between the neutron and the sample is determined mainly by two\nmechanisms: the strong interaction, which couples the neutrons to the nuclei, and\nthe magnetic dipole interaction, which couples the neutrons to the sample's magnetic\nmoment [97]. The latter mechanism is owed to the neutron's non-zero magnetic\nmoment, given by\ns\n\u03bc = gN \u03bcN ,\n(3.1)\n~\nwhere gN = \u22121.913 is the neutron gyromagnetic ratio, s is the neutron spin operator\nand \u03bcN is the nuclear magneton, whose magnitude is approximately 1000 times\nsmaller than the Bohr magneton. The potential experienced by a neutron during\na scattering event is then a combination of a short-range interaction, arising from\nthe nuclei, and a long-range potential, arising from the sample's unpaired electrons.\nBoth interactions are typically rather weak, hence it is common in mathematical\nmodels of experimental data to treat scattering as a first order process [98].\n\n\fChapter 3. A Novel Proposal for Neutron Entanglement\n\n30\n\nNeutron scattering is unfortunately a costly technique, which must be carried out in\napposite facilities. These come under two categories: fission research reactors, and\nspallation sources. Fission reactors, also known as continuous sources, produce a\nsteady stream of neutrons via a controlled chain reaction. When heavy elements such\nas uranium or plutonium absorb a slow neutron, the nucleus splits into two lighter\ncomponents, releasing two or three fast neutrons in the process. These are referred\nto as prompt neutrons, because they are the first products of the reaction. They\nare subsequently followed by delayed neutrons, produced by the decay of the fission\nfragments. Each of these neutrons can trigger a new fission event, giving rise to a\nchain reaction. This is kept in check by removing excess neutrons, which are slowed\nby passage through a moderator and absorbed by control rods. The moderator is a\nlarge volume of material such as water or solid graphite, that absorbs weakly but\nscatters strongly. The rods, on the other hand, are typically boron-rich, as boron\nhas a high neutron capture cross section.\nIt is sometimes desirable to produce pulses of neutrons rather than a continuous\nstream. This offers a means to distinguish the processes contributing to the scattering event, which do not typically occur on the same timescales2 . Fission reactors\ncan be made to operate as pulsed sources with the help of a chopper. Essentially,\nthis is a shutter positioned downstream from the source, which is opened and closed\nperiodically so that only neutrons with well-defined velocities pass through. Pulsed\nbeams can also be produced by spallation, which involves bombarding a heavy nucleus with a high-energy proton beam, usually produced in a particle accelerator. As\na result of the collision, several neutrons are knocked out of the atom, while others\nboil off as the nucleus heats up. Spallation typically produces 20 or 30 neutrons per\ncollision, but requires more energy than it delivers, therefore chain reactions cannot\noccur.\nOnce the neutrons have been produced, they are typically directed away from the\nsource by a neutron guide. This is a channel with high reflectivity at small incidence\nangles, often curved to reduce the line of sight from the source to the sample, hence\navoiding contamination of the scattered signal by stray high-energy neutrons. Upon\nemerging from the guide, the neutrons often undergo some kind of velocity selection,\nafter which their fate is determined by the purpose of the experiment.\n2\n\nInelastic and fast-neutron processes occur shortly after the pulse, whereas neutron capture\nprocesses follow some time after.\n\n\fChapter 3. A Novel Proposal for Neutron Entanglement\n\n31\n\nFinally, once scattering has taken place, the outgoing neutrons are detected. This is\nnot a trivial task, because most currently available detection techniques are designed\nfor charged particles. High-efficiency detection can be achieved using hydrogen-rich\nscintillators, because hydrogen is a strong scatterer. Otherwise, detection occurs via\na two-step process, typically involving a reaction that produces charged by-products\n[98, 99].\nThe field of neutron scattering is incredibly vast; the above is intended to provide\nonly the most basic overview. Where necessary, I will go into more detail with\nregard to instrumentation and experimental techniques. The formal description of\nneutron scattering will be the subject of a separate discussion.\n\n3.2\n\nNotation\n\nHaving reached this point, it is convenient to define some 'shorthand' notation,\nwhich will be employed throughout this thesis. Unless otherwise specified, quantum\nstates will be expressed in accordance with the Bloch sphere convention, which labels the spin-up and down eigenstates of \u03c3z with the kets |0i and |1i, respectively.\n\nThe wavefunction of a many-body system fully polarized in the positive (negative)\n\u1e91 direction will be represented as |0i (|1i). Depending on the magnitude and orientation of an external magnetic field along \u1e91, either |0i or |1i may correspond to the\n\nsystem's ground state. Excitations from the ground state are obtained by rotating\nindividual spins through an angle \u03c0. A particle whose spin is anti-aligned with the\nground state configuration will be referred to as a 'spin flip'. A fully aligned state\nwith a single spin flip at site j will be represented as |ji; a fully aligned state with\nspin flips at sites j and l will be represented as |jli, and so on.\n\nFor reasons of mathematical simplicity, the majority of the analysis carried out in\nthis thesis is concerned with pure states. Often, these will be described in terms of\na density operator, conventionally labeled \u03c1. For a state vector |\u03a8i, this takes the\nform\n\n\u03c1 = |\u03a8ih\u03a8|.\n\n(3.2)\n\nIf \u03c1 represents a many-particle system, the density operator of a subsystem is obtained by performing a partial trace. For a system of two qubits A and B, one then\n\n\fChapter 3. A Novel Proposal for Neutron Entanglement\n\n32\n\nhas\n\u03c1A (B) = TrA (B) [\u03c1AB ] ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere \u03c1AB represents the composite density matrix.\nVariables and operators will usually be assigned a set of qualifying indices; however, these will be omitted whenever the context allows, to make for more compact\nnotation.\n\n3.3\n\nApproximations\n\nTo provide a more complete picture of the scope and interpretation of this work, it\nis useful to head the description of the protocol with an explanation of the approximations that underlie it. These have been chosen according to the twin criteria of\nanalytical computability and experimental feasibility, and much care has been taken\nto strike a balance between the two, as the ultimate goal is to design a feasible experiment.\nAs regards the operating conditions, it will be assumed the sample is at zero temperature and completely isolated from surrounding noise. This removes the risk of\nthermally induced spin flips or other forms of decoherence. The sample and the\nneutrons are immersed in a static, uniform magnetic field aligned with the \u1e91 direction. This is chosen as the quantization axis. The effect of the field on the neutrons\nwill be neglected, as the neutron magnetic moment is O(103 ) times smaller than the\nelectron magnetic moment. The neutrons themselves are produced by an ultra-cold\nsource capable of imparting an arbitrary, user-defined polarization. Neutron velocities are chosen not to exceed 10 ms\u22121 , with corresponding energies of order 10\u22127 eV.\nSources of this type have been in operation for some years now, an example being the\nPF2 source at the Institute Laue-Langevin in Grenoble (see Appendix B and [100]).\nIt is assumed the intensity of the source is low, so that very few neutrons interact\nwith the sample at any chosen moment. This should not be a problem, as scattering\nfacilities go to great lengths to avoid producing dilute beams. High-intensity sources\ncould also be adapted to serve our purpose, provided they were operated in pulsed\nmode - indeed, when a continuous beam is chopped, a large proportion of the flux\nis lost. In addition, neutrons are weakly interacting particles with an extremely low\n\n\fChapter 3. A Novel Proposal for Neutron Entanglement\n\n33\n\nscattering cross section; therefore, the probability of many neutrons scattering at\nonce is small.\nThe sample from which the neutrons scatter is modeled as a magnetically ordered\ncrystal, in which the unpaired electrons are localized near the equilibrium positions\nof the ions in the lattice. This is known as the Heitler-London model, and provides a\ngood description of ferromagnetic insulators such as EuO, LaMnO3.12 and few other\nmaterials [101, 102, 103]. Magnetic scattering is provided by the long range dipolar\nforce between the neutron and the unpaired electrons, while nuclear scattering is\nprovided by the short-range strong force. I assume LS coupling, i.e. that orbital\nand spin angular momenta of the individual ions can be summed to yield total\norbital and spin angular momenta, defined by the quantum numbers L and S. I\nwork in the limit of L = 0; this could describe a lattice of s-shell electrons, and also\na more general situation in which the resultant orbital angular momentum is either\nzero, or quenched by the internal electric field of the crystal. Magnetic scattering\nof the neutrons will be teated as a purely electronic effect; the nuclear spins will\nbe completely neglected. This is reasonable, as the strength of magnetic scattering\nfrom nuclear dipole moments is approximately two orders of magnitude weaker than\nthat from electronic dipole moments [104].\nThe electrons in the sample are coupled by a translationally invariant potential\nwhich conserves the total spin quantum number Sz . A reasonable example of such\na potential is Coulomb nearest-neighbour exchange, given by the Heisenberg Hamiltonian\nH0 = \u2212\n\nX\n\nJij \u03c3 i * \u03c3 j ,\n\n(3.4)\n\nhiji\n\nwhere the notation hiji indicates the sum over all nearest-neighbouring pairs, and\nJij represents the coupling strength between nearest neighbours. For simplicity, I\nwill take this to be constant and positive, so as to describe a ferromagnetic sample.\nThe full Hamiltonian of the system then reads\nH0 = \u2212J\n\nX\nhiji\n\ni\n\nj\n\n\u03c3 * \u03c3 + Bz\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03c3zj ,\n\n(3.5)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere Bz > 0 is the strength of the external field and N is the number of spins in\n\u0001\nthe sample. Each spin is represented by the operator \u03c3 j = \u03c3xj , \u03c3yj , \u03c3zj , where the\n\n\fChapter 3. A Novel Proposal for Neutron Entanglement\n\n34\n\n\u03c3\u03b1j are the Pauli matrices for spin j.\nThe sample itself is a macroscopic, periodic system experiencing negligible boundary\neffects. Each neutron scatters from the sample as a wavepacket of spatial width\n\u03b4x and momentum width \u03b4p , whose relationship is determined by the uncertainty\nprinciple\n~\n\u03b4x \u03b4p \u2265 .\n(3.6)\n2\nIt will be assumed \u03b4x is comparable to the size of the sample, or, equivalently, that\nthe neutron interacts with all the sample spins at once (figure 3.2). The validity of\nthis assumption will be discussed in section 5.5.\n\nFigure 3.2: A one-dimensional snapshot of the scattering geometry. The sample sees the neutron\nas a wavepacket, the peak of which travels with momentum k0 .\n\nThe scattering events are described as sequential, time-dependent interactions with\nthe potential occurring such that no direct interaction between the neutrons takes\nplace at any time. Only neutrons scattered into a specific Bragg peak will be detected. Upon emerging from the source, the neutrons are uncorrelated and polarized\nin the same (arbitrary) direction, specified by the coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b2, which can\ntake on any real or complex value satisfying |\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2 = 1. To begin with, I will\nconsider a simplified model in which only two neutrons scatter from the sample. The\ninitial state of the system as a whole is then a product of the states of the neutrons\n\n\fChapter 3. A Novel Proposal for Neutron Entanglement\n\n35\n\nand the sample. It is convenient to represent this as\n|\u03c80 i = (\u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i)2 (\u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i)1 |\u03c8 s i,\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhere |\u03c8 n im = (\u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i)m is the state of neutron m, and s stands for 'sample'.\nHereafter, I will refer to the system of neutrons plus sample simply as 'the system'.\nWith these details in place, I now describe the entanglement scheme.\n\n3.4\n\nThe Protocol\n\nThe protocol can be thought of in terms of four phases:\n1. The first period of free evolution of the sample, before the arrival of the first\nneutron pulse;\n2. The interaction between the first neutron and the sample;\n3. The second period of free evolution of the sample, before the arrival of the\nsecond neutron pulse;\n4. The interaction between the second neutron and the sample.\nFrom a qualitative viewpoint, the first scattering event has the effect of depositing\nthe 'spin information' carried by the first neutron in the sample. As we will see in\nchapter 5, this signature can remain intact during the second period of free evolution.\nThe sample therefore behaves as an 'entanglement safety-deposit box', which retains\nthe information deposited by the first neutron until the second neutron comes to\nclaim it. However, the entanglement between the neutrons is conditional on the\nsecond scattering event being able to 'undo' -in part or in full- the transformation\non the sample spin precipitated by the the arrival of the first neutron (see section\n5.3).\nThe protocol begins by initializing the sample and the neutrons to a known state,\nchosen such that |\u03c80 i contains at most two spin flips. The motivation for this restriction is mathematical rather than physical, and stems from the hope of attaining\nan analytically solvable model by reducing the size of the working Hilbert space (see\n\n\fChapter 3. A Novel Proposal for Neutron Entanglement\n\n36\n\nsection 4.5). Two possible combinations of |\u03c8 n i and |\u03c8 s i are considered here, and I\nlabel these |\u03c80A i and |\u03c80B i. In state |\u03c80A i, the neutrons are polarized parallel to the\npositive \u1e91-axis and the sample is prepared in a single spin-flip state. In |\u03c80B i, the\n\nneutrons have arbitrary polarization while the sample is prepared in a fully aligned\nstate. Hence\n#\n\"\nN\nX\n1\n|j i ,\n(3.8)\n|\u03c80A i = |0i2|0i1 \u221a\nN j=1\n|\u03c80B i = (\u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i)2 (\u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i)1 |0i.\n\n(3.9)\n\nFrom equations (3.7) and (3.8), for |\u03c80A i we have\n\u03b1 = 1,\n\n(3.10)\n\n\u03b2 = 0,\n\n(3.11)\n\n|\u03c8 n i1 = |\u03c8 n i2 = |0i,\nN\n1 X\ns\n|j i.\n|\u03c8 i = \u221a\nN j=1\n\n(3.12)\n(3.13)\n\nThe state |\u03c80A i contains a single spin flip, which is localized on the sample. This is\n\nthe only realistic means to create a single spin flip state, as the alternative would\ninvolve polarizing the neutrons in opposite directions while taking |\u03c8 s i = |0i. While\nthe latter is certainly feasible, the former is decidedly not. The form of |\u03c8 s i is\n\nfamiliar from linear spin wave theory [105]; indeed, equation (3.13) represents the\nzero-momentum single magnon eigenstate of the Hamiltonian (3.5). In zero field,\nthis is degenerate with the ground state, but a finite field breaks the degeneracy.\nNow, comparing equations (3.7) and (3.9) shows that, for |\u03c80B i\n|\u03c8 n i = \u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i,\n|\u03c8 s i = |0 i.\n\n(3.14)\n(3.15)\n\nIn its most general form, this state contains zero, one and two-spin-flip components.\nBoth spin flips are localized on the neutrons, while the sample is in a fully polarized\nstate. In zero field, this is one of the degenerate ground states of the system. In a\nfinite field, it's energy is determined by the relative magnitude of J and Bz .\n\n\fChapter 3. A Novel Proposal for Neutron Entanglement\n\n37\n\nIn the time interval between state initialization and the arrival of the first pulse, the\nsample undergoes free evolution under the effect of (3.5). When the pulse reaches\nthe sample, all neutrons but one pass through without scattering. The neutron in\nquestion remains coupled to the sample for a time \u03c4 , and the interaction generates\nentanglement between the neutron and the sample3 . When the neutron departs, the\nsample undergoes a second period of free evolution, which ends with the arrival of\na second pulse. The second scattering event is identical to the first, and has the\neffect of redistributing the entanglement in the system. As a result, part of the\nentanglement between the first neutron and the sample is swapped to the second\nneutron.\nThe next step involves establishing whether the two scattered neutrons have acquired\na correlation as a result of the scattering process. This can be achieved by measuring\na witness operator W, as defined in chapter 2. Let us call the density operator of\nthe scattered neutrons \u03c1n ; if this state is entangled, the eigenspectrum of its partial\ntranspose should contain a negative eigenvalue \u03bb\u2212 , corresponding to eigenvector\n|e\u2212 i. The witness operator is then defined by\nW = |e\u2212 ihe\u2212 |,\n\n(3.16)\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\nsuch that Tr W TA \u03c1n = Tr W \u03c1TnA < 0. It will be shown in chapter 5 that, when\n\nthe protocol has the desired outcome, this witness can be measured with as few as\nthree device settings.\n\nThe protocol is deemed successful if the entanglement measured by the witness\nexceeds some threshold value E. In general, this depends on two factors: (i) creating\nat least E units of entanglement between the first neutron and the sample during the\n\nfirst scattering event, and (ii) swapping the state of the second neutron and the state\nof the sample during the second scattering event. Point (i) follows from theorems\non entanglement monogamy [46], according to which the total entanglement of the\nfirst neutron with the rest of the system must remain constant throughout the\nprotocol. Therefore, if the two neutrons are found to share X ebits of entanglement\nafter the second scattering event, the first neutron must have shared that same\namount of entanglement with the sample prior to this event. Point (ii) implies the\nsecond scattering event must change the distribution of entanglement within the\n3\n\nThe mechanism whereby this occurs will be explained in more detail in chapter 5.\n\n\f38\n\nChapter 3. A Novel Proposal for Neutron Entanglement\n\nsystem. In an ideal scenario, the second neutron and the sample would experience a\ncomplete role reversal; in practise only a partial swap takes place, because it is not\npossible to tune neutron interaction times separately (see section 5.4). Therefore,\nthe entanglement between the neutrons is typically less than X, owing both to the\nresidual correlation between the first neutron and the sample, and to the creation\nof correlations between the second neutron and the sample.\n\n3.5\n\nThe Hamiltonian\n\nDuring each phase of the protocol described in section 3.4, the evolution of the\nsystem as a whole is governed by a specific Hamiltonian. In phases 1 and 3, this is\njust the free Hamiltonian of the sample, given in equation (3.5). Phases 2 and 4, on\nthe other hand, require a Hamiltonian that describes both the intrinsic dynamics of\nthe sample and its interaction with the incoming neutron. If the initial state of the\nsystem is fully separable, the Hamiltonians of phases 2 and 4 must not commute, else\nno correlation can be established between the scattered neutrons [106]. Therefore,\nthe sample needs to 'know' which neutron arrived first; in other words, the sample\nmust have some memory.\nLet us label the Hamiltonians associated with phases 2 and 4 with H1 and H2 , to\nindicate the neutron involved in that particular phase.

Therefore, V s depends only\n\non the direction of the momentum transfer. Expanding the cross product in equation\n(3.23) shows the component in the direction of Q must disappear.

Physically, Q = 0 describes forward scattering, i.e. scattering in the direction of the\nincoming momentum.\nEquation (3.31) represents an interaction capable of creating spin excitations in the\nsample. This process costs energy, which in zero external field is detracted from the\nkinetic energy of the neutron. It may then seem counterintuitive that scattering at\nzero momentum transfer - that is, elastic scattering - creates spin flips. To resolve\nthe controversy, we recall that V sex is an average over a range of Q around Q = 0.\nThe averaging procedure accounts for the fact that a Bragg peak is not infinitely\nsharp, an effect owed to the finite size of the sample. Averaging over a range of\nmomenta centred at a certain Q is therefore equivalent to detecting all neutrons\n\n\fChapter 3. A Novel Proposal for Neutron Entanglement\n\n42\n\nscattered into a Bragg peak of finite width about Q. The width of the peak is\nof order D \u22121 , as expressed by the range of the sinc function of equation (3.23).\nThe variation of the Hamiltonian over this range is negligible, hence the effective\nHamiltonian is well-approximated by its value at the centre of the peak.\n\n3.6\n\nQuantum State Evolution\n\nThe final point I would like to make regards the method I use to derive the scattered\nstate of the system. As the initial state |\u03c80 i is pure, the scattered state can be\nobtained by straightforward time-evolution using the canonical operator U(H, t) =\nexp [\u2212iHt]. This operator must reflect the four stages of the protocol, hence U(H, t)\ncan be expressed as a product of four terms\nU(H, t) = U(H2 , \u03c4 )U(H0 , \u03c4f\u2032 )U(H1 , \u03c4 )U(H0 , \u03c4f ),\n\n(3.32)\n\ndescribing phases 4, 3, 2 and 1, respectively. None of the terms commute (save,\ntrivially, the second and fourth), so U(H, t) truly represents a specific sequence of\nevents. It is furthermore evident that, in zero field, the first and second periods of\nfree evolution only contribute a phase to the scattered state. During phase 1, this\nis true in finite fields also, because both |\u03c80A i and |\u03c80B i are eigenstates of H0 . The\nscattered state |\u03c8fA,B i is then, modulo a phase factor\n|\u03c8fA,B i = U(H2 , \u03c4 )U(H0 , \u03c4f\u2032 )U(H1 , \u03c4 )|\u03c80A,B i.\n\n(3.33)\n\nFrom here, the state \u03c1n of the neutrons can be obtained by calculating the system\ndensity matrix \u03c1 = |\u03c8fA,B ih\u03c8fA,B | and tracing out the sample.\nUltimately, the outcome of the protocol is determined by the neutron polarization\n(\u03b1, \u03b2) and the interaction time \u03c4 . It is therefore essential to relate these parameters\nto the experimental settings of our equipment. The physical interpretation of \u03b1\nand \u03b2 is immediate, as they are simply the direct numerical expression of the real\nproperty that is the neutron polarization. For \u03c4 , on the other hand, the situation is\na little more hazy, because the interaction time between the neutron and the sample\nis not in itself a well-defined quantity. In fact, scattering problems are not typically\nsolved in terms of state vectors. Conventionally, one works with cross sections,\n\n\fChapter 3. A Novel Proposal for Neutron Entanglement\n\n43\n\nwhich represent the probability that a certain scattering event will result in neutrons\nbeing detected in a specific region of space, and with a certain polarization. The\nwavefunctions \u03a8 of the scattered neutrons satisfy the Lippmann-Schwinger equation\n[108]\n\u03a8 = \u03a6 + GV \u03a8,\n\n(3.34)\n\nwhere \u03a6 is a solution to the time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation, V is the scattering potential and G is known as the retarded Green function. To obtain these\nsolutions, one acts on the initial state of the system with an operator known as the\nS-matrix, given by\nS = I \u2212 2\u03c0iT \u03b4 (E \u2032 \u2212 E) ,\n\n(3.35)\n\nwhere T is the transition matrix, related to the scattering potential as T = V (1 \u2212 GV )\u22121 .\nThe S-matrix is universally acknowledged as providing the correct description for the\nobservable outcome of a scattering experiment. It follows that any results obtained\nwith a quantum-mechanical treatment should measure up to the predictions of the\nS-matrix method. Comparing the outcomes of the two techniques may therefore\nprovide an indication of the relationship between \u03c4 and real, physical quantities one\nmight be able to measure and tune. I will explore this possibility in the following\nchapter.\n\n3.7\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this chapter, I have described an original protocol aimed at creating entanglement between two distinct neutrons. The success of the protocol would provide the\nquantum information processing community with a novel source of entanglement,\nas well as a playground for the test of quantum effects with neutrons.\nThe present scheme bears some superficial similarities with a proposal for entanglement extraction from a solid, advanced some years ago by De Chiara et al. [81]. As\nthe name suggests, the protocol involves sending two uncorrelated probe neutrons\nto interact separately with two entangled spins in a bulk solid. It is shown that, if\nthe neutrons and the sample spins are coupled by an interaction similar to (3.31),\nfor some values of the interaction time it is possible to transfer the entanglement\n\n\fChapter 3. A Novel Proposal for Neutron Entanglement\n\n44\n\nof the sample spins to the probes. In addition, in the limit of multiple collisions,\nthe entanglement between the probes approaches unity. The authors proceed to\ndescribe a more realistic situation, in which each probe neutron, being a wavepacket\nof finite width, interacts with a subset of spins in the sample, which is prepared in a\nstate analogous to (3.13). In this case, the probes are entangled only if the separate\nspin subsets are entangled; in other words, the success of the protocol relies on the\npresence of entanglement between different parts of the sample.\nThree main points distinguish this protocol from the scheme I have suggested. First,\nthe interaction of the neutrons with the sample is sequential, meaning the respective\ninteraction Hamiltonians do not commute. This is not the case in [81], because\nthe probes interact simultaneously with spatially separated regions of the sample.\nSecond, I assume the incoming neutron couples to all the sample spins, rather than\na subset. This creates a three-body entangled state of the neutrons and the sample,\nwhich for certain values of the interaction time is close to being separable with\nrespect to the neutrons/sample bi-partition. Finally, and most important of all, no\nprior entanglement is necessary for the protocol to succeed: the scattered neutrons\ncan become entangled even if the sample is prepared in a fully separable state. This\nallows for greater flexibility in state initialization, and in general renders the protocol\na more versatile and realistic alternative to that of [81].\n\n\fChapter 4\nThe Formal Theory of Neutron\nScattering\nIn this chapter, I illustrate the relationship between time-dependent and time-independent\ntreatments of scattering as applied to the entangling protocol discussed previously.\nThe time-independent counterpart of the scattered state |\u03c8fA,B i will be calculated for\n\nboth Q = 0 and Q 6= 0 scattering geometries. This form will be compared to an\nexpansion of equation (3.33) in terms of the acting potentials to yield the physical\nsignificance of the time parameter \u03c4 in this context. A review of the traditional,\ntime-independent scattering formalism developed by Heisenberg, often referred to as\nthe S-matrix method, can be found in Appendix A and follows the work of Gell-Mann\nand Goldberger [109].\n\n4.1\n\nA Preliminary Study\n\nTo first order in the scattering potential, the S-matrix representing scattering between initial and final eigenstates of the free Hamiltonian of the system is\nS (1) = I \u2212 2\u03c0iV \u03b4 (Ei \u2212 Ej ) ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere Ej and Ei are the initial and final eigenenergies of the free Hamiltonian,\nrespectively.

Let us then\nconsider a one-dimensional Gaussian wavepacket of width w, centred on position\nx0 and momentum k0 , traversing a region of uniform magnetic field of strength Bz\noriented along \u1e91, as shown in figure 4.1.\n\nFigure 4.1: Transmission and reflection of a wavepacket of incident energy E from a barrier of\nheight B < E.\n\nAt time t, the state of the wavepacket at any point along the x\u0302 axis is given by\n|\u03c8 (x, x0 , k0 , w, t)i =\n\nX X \u0010 \u03c0 \u0011\u2212 41\n2 2\ne\u2212i(k\u2212k0 )x0 e\u2212(k\u2212k0 ) w e\u2212iEk t/~\u03c6k,\u03c3 (x),\n2\n2w\n\u03c3\nk\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere the Ek represent the energies of each k-component, corresponding to space\nand spin eigenfunctions \u03c6k,\u03c3 .

For a set of integers m, one\nthen has\n2\u03c0\n.\n(4.12)\nkm = m\nL\nThe group velocity of each km component is a linear function of km ; therefore, the\nwavepacket spreads as it travels, as shown in figure 4.1. Let us assume that, at\nsome time t = 0, the wavepacket is located at a point xin to the left-hand side\nof the barrier. After a time ts , we measure the position of its peak and find it to\nbe at xout , on the right-hand side of the barrier. ts then defines the time required\nfor the wavepacket to travel a distance |xin \u2212 xout |. Provided xin is sufficiently far\nfrom the barrier, the spin component of the wavepacket is initially oriented along\nthe positive x\u0302 axis. By the time we reach xout , the spin has been rotated to some\nnew orientation, which can be estimated by calculating the expectation values of\nthe Pauli operators \u03c3x , \u03c3y and \u03c3z from the density operator of the system at time ts\nh\u03c3\u03b1 i = Tr [\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c1 (ts )] ,\n\n(4.13)\n\n\f48\n\nChapter 4.

Changes in the \u03c6 coordinate of the spin presumably took place while\nthe wavepacket was passing through the field. We can estimate the approximate\nduration of this phase from the wavepacket's average velocity inside the barrier\nv\u0304 =\n\n(q\u2191 + q\u2193 )\n,\n2\n\n(4.14)\n\ngiving\n\nL\n.\n(4.15)\nv\u0304\nIs it then valid to identify tB with the time taken by the spin to rotate from (\u03c0/2, 0) to\n(\u03b8, \u03c6), or is there some other timescale associated with spin rotation? In other words,\ntB \u2248\n\ndo the 'space' and 'spin' clocks tick at the same rate? To answer this question, I\ncalculate how much a single spin initially oriented along the positive x\u0302 axis precesses\nabout \u1e91 under the effect of the field Bz \u1e91. If this value is compatible with the\n\u03c6 angles given by the h\u03c3\u03b1 i, there is good reason to assume the 'space' and 'spin'\nclocks measure time in the same way.\nFigure 4.2 shows a few examples at fixed L, L, k0 and x0 . Here, the three axes\nrepresent the eigenstates of \u03c3x , \u03c3y and \u03c3z in the Bloch sphere, and the red vector\nindicates the spin orientation of the wavepacket at time t = 0. The green vector\nshows the expected precession around \u1e91 over a time tB , and the orange segment\nillustrates the range of possible spin orientations over the width of the peak. Note\nthat the states of the system at time ts are not always pure, hence the magnitude of\nthe vectors forming the orange segment can be less than unity. It is clear from this\nfigure that for the chosen values of the input parameters one finds good agreement\nbetween the 'space' and 'spin' clocks of the system.\nWhat remains now is to verify whether this holds in a more general context also.\nTherefore, I return to the entangling protocol, and to a more formal approach, by\nderiving the scattered state of the system according to the S-matrix formalism.\nFor simplicity, I will assume elastic scattering at both zero and finite momentum\ntransfer.

Neglecting for the moment the subscript m, the orthonormality\nof the neutron states obeys the relation\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nhk \u03c3 |k\u03c3i =\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0\nL\n\n\u00133\n\n\u03b4(k \u2032 \u2212 k)\u03b4\u03c3 \u03c3 \u2032 ,\n\n(4.18)\n\n\u0001\nL 3\nwhere \u03b4(k \u2032 \u2212 k) is a three-dimensional delta function in momentum and 2\u03c0\nis\nthe number of states per unit volume of momentum space. The orthonormality\ncondition of equation (4.18) also applies to the states of the system as a whole,\nprovided one now takes the ket |\u03c3i to label the overall spin state of neutron plus\nsample. Indeed, as the spatial part of the sample's wavefunction is not changed by\nthe scattering event, the sample is entirely described by its spin state.\n\nFollowing section 3.5, we focus on neutrons scattered into the Bragg peak at Q = 0\nand calculate the spin state produced by the action of the S matrix by integrating\nthe scattered state over the spatial coordinates of the neutron. Recall, however, that\nthe peak has finite width, due to the finite size of the sample. Our intention is to\ncollect all neutrons scattered into the peak, not just those precisely obeying ki = kf .\nAs measurements will be made after both neutrons have scattered, it is in our\ninterest to maintain a certain amount of uncertainty in these measurements, because\nthe spatial and spinor parts of the wavefunction of scattered neutrons are usually\nentangled [110]. Therefore, an exact measurement of momentum would destroy any\nindeterminacy in the spin state of the neutron, proving counterproductive to the\nsuccess of the entangling protocol. To account for this effect, we take the outgoing\n\n\f51\n\nChapter 4.

The Formal Theory of Neutron Scattering\n\nLet us repeat the integration of equation (4.22). To within a constant, the form of\nf (G) is known from equation (3.25). It is therefore convenient to set\nf (Qz ) = V0 + \u039b\n\nsxm\n\nN\nX\n\nsxj + sym\n\nN\nX\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nsyj\n\n!\n\n= V sxy .\n\n(4.37)\n\nSubstituting equations (4.22) and (4.37) into (4.36), one finds\n|\u03c8f\u03c3 i\n\niD 3\n= \u2212 2 V sxy\n4\u03c0\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\nQ * D \u03b4(q \u2212 k0 )\nSa\ndq.\n2\nq\nq\n\nZ\n\n(4.38)\n\nThis can be resolved as before, with the help of equations (4.26), (4.27), (4.28) and\n(4.29), to give\nN\n\nN\n\nX\nX y\nD\n|\u03c8f\u03c3 i = \u2212iV sxy |\u03c3i = \u2212i V0 + \u039b sxm\nsxj + sym\nsj\nk0\nj=1\nj=1\n\n!\n\nD\n|\u03c3i.\nk0\n\n(4.39)\n\nOwing to the lack of a non-imaginary component proportional to the identity, this\ncannot be immediately traced back to an expansion of the time evolution operator to any order in the scattering potential. One is therefore left with a series of\npossibilities, among which:\n1. The neutron interaction time is not a well-defined quantity for this process;\n2. The correct interpretation of the interaction time emerges from a higher order\nexpansion of the S matrix;\n3. The present model is too simplistic; the presence of an apparently complexvalued time parameter may then result from failing to take into account additional processes, such as decoherence.\nRelated to this final point, the significance of imaginary time in quantum mechanics,\nand particularly in scattering theory, is a topic of intense debate, which has yet\nto find a unique resolution. It has been suggested that the complex part of the\ntime parameter arises from changes in the scattering probability with potential.\nSpecifically, Im[\u03c4 ] is thought to describe the variation in the number of particles\nscattered per unit time, per unit change of the scattering potential [111]. The\nderivation of this result is based on a spin-independent potential, therefore it may\n\n\fChapter 4. The Formal Theory of Neutron Scattering\n\n56\n\nnot be of strict relevance to the present discussion. However, it is interesting that\nqualitatively similar findings should crop up also in the context of tunneling [112,\n113].\nWe can conclude that scattering at finite momentum transfer cannot immediately\nbe described in a physically intuitive time-dependent frame. Consequently, it is\ndifficult to see how parameters such as the neutron interaction time may be tuned\nin an experimental setting. It may be that the entangling protocol of the previous\nchapter translates into a feasible scheme at zero momentum transfer only. Therefore,\nI will restrict subsequent analysis to realizations of the protocol at Q = 0.\n\n4.4\n\nThe Magnetic Coupling Strength\n\nWe conclude from sections 4.2 and 4.3 that in the limit of weak scattering (T \u2248 V ),\none can ascribe a well-defined physical meaning to the time-evolution of the spin\npart of the system wavefunction only in the case of forward scattering. The Hamiltonian representing this process resembles an exchange interaction, whose strength\nwe define as \u039bE . To complete our understanding of the scattering process, I will\nnow discuss the value of this parameter.\nThe Hamiltonian of (4.34) is derived by taking a spatial matrix element of the\npotential of equation (3.19). Let us isolate the magnetic part of this potential,\nwriting\nVB = \u2212\u03bcm * B(r) \u03b8D (r) .\n\n(4.40)\n\nWe then have\nZ\n1\ne\u2212ikf *r [\u03bcm * B(r) \u03b8D (r)] eiki *r dr =\nhk|VB |ki = \u2212 3\nL all space\nZ\n\u03bcm\n= \u2212 3 * eiQ*r B(r) \u03b8D (r) dr.\nL\n\n(4.41)\n\nAt zero momentum transfer, the exponential term reduces to unity, leaving\n\u03bcm\nhk|VB |ki = \u2212 3 *\nL\n\nZ\n\nall space\n\nB(r) \u03b8D (r) dr.\n\n(4.42)\n\n\f57\n\nChapter 4.

Fortunately, the need to deal with exponentially growing\nmatrices is removed by exploiting the symmetries of equation (4.34), and the periodic\nnature of the sample. Let us define the operators Sz and Sz , which represent the\nz-components of the total spin of the sample and of the system, respectively. It is\neasily shown that\n[H0 , Sz ] = [H0 , Sz ] = [V s , Sz ] = 0,\n\n(4.51)\n\ntherefore both the free Hamiltonian of the sample and the interaction potential have\nexcitation-number conserving symmetries. Bearing in mind our chosen initial states\ncontain at most two spin flips, this allows us to define a reduced computational basis,\ncomprising all possible zero-, single- and double-spin-flip states. The dimensions of\nthe reduced basis can be calculated by summing the binomial coefficients\n(N +2) C1 and (N +2) C2 , to obtain\nd=\n\nN 2 5N\n+\n+ 4.\n2\n2\n\n(N +2) C0 ,\n\n(4.52)\n\nThis grows quadratically rather than exponentially with N, but still blows up as N\nbecomes large.\nA further reduction is possible if one abandons the canonical basis. The single- and\ndouble- spin-flip eigenstates of a periodic sample can be expressed in terms of Bloch\n\n\fChapter 4. The Formal Theory of Neutron Scattering\n\n59\n\nvectors |s1k i and |s2k i\nN\n1 X ik*rj\n= \u221a\ne\n|ji,\nN j=1\ns\nN\nX\n2\n2\n|sk i =\nN(N \u2212 1)\n\n|s1k i\n\n{j, l6=j}=1\n\n(4.53)\neik*(rj +rl ) |j li.\n\n(4.54)\n\nAs the initial states of the system are translationally invariant, and neither H0 nor\nV s contain any spatial dependence, coupling to states |s1k i and |s2k i is null unless\nk = 0. The Hilbert space of the sample is, therefore, fully specified by the vectors\n|0i, |s10 i and |s20 i. Combining these with the four canonical two-neutron basis states,\nit is possible to define a complete 8-dimensional basis for the system, comprising the\nfollowing eigenvectors\n|1i = |000i,\n\n(4.55)\n\n|2i = |001s i,\n\n(4.56)\n\n|3i = |002s i,\n\n(4.57)\n\n|4i = |010i,\n\n(4.58)\n\n|5i = |011s i,\n\n(4.59)\n\n|6i = |100i,\n\n(4.60)\n\n|7i = |101s i,\n\n(4.61)\n\n|8i = |110i,\n\n(4.62)\n\nwhere |000i \u2261 |0i2 |0i1 |0i, and so on. Unless otherwise stated, from this point onwards equations (4.55)-(4.62) will be my computational basis. For ease of reference,\nI call this the Bloch basis, and drop all indices to simplify notation. Henceforth, the\nvalues inside bras and kets should be interpreted as labeling |second neutron, first\nneutron, samplei, respectively.\nThe dimensions of the Bloch basis are fixed, manageable, and independent of the\nsize of the sample. As a result, many calculations can be done analytically and\noperator representation is greatly simplified. The initial states of the system, for\n\n\fChapter 4. The Formal Theory of Neutron Scattering\n\n60\n\ninstance, can now be written as\n|\u03c80A i = |2i,\n\n(4.63)\n\n|\u03c80B i = \u03b12 |1i + \u03b1\u03b2 (|4i + |6i) + \u03b2 2 |8i.\n\n(4.64)\n\nAlso, the zero field free Hamiltonian becomes a multiple of the identity\nH0 = \u2212JNI,\n\n(4.65)\n\nowing to the fact that the sample basis states |0i, |s10 i and |s20 i are degenerate\neigenstates of H0 with eigenvalue \u2212JN. Equation (4.65) underlines a very important\n\npoint: the internal coupling of the spins in the sample plays no meaningful role in\nthe dynamics of the system. Hence, both the numerical value of J and its sign\nare irrelevant. This warrants two observations. First, provided one could prepare\nthe same initial states, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic samples would produce\nexactly the same outcome. Second, in zero field the evolution of the system between\nscattering events is trivial. Therefore, if one did succeed in producing a correlation\nbetween the neutrons, this correlation would not depend on the time elapsed between\nthe departure of the first neutron and the arrival of the second. Qualitatively, this\nmeans the 'information' deposited in the sample by the first neutron can survive\nindefinitely; in other words, the sample functions as a perfect quantum memory\nbetween scattering events. Note this is a specific feature of the present model, and\nshould not be interpreted as a result of general validity.\n\n4.6\n\nConclusions\n\nThe scattering of a neutron from a sample is usually described as a time-independent,\nprobabilistic process. In the case of forward scattering, it is possible to recast the\nproblem in a temporal frame, thus showing that the interaction time of a neutron\nwith a scatterer is, in the limit of weak scattering, the time taken by the neutron to\ntraverse the sample. At finite momentum transfer, the interpretation of \u03c4 remains\nunclear. It emerges from a first-order calculation that \u03c4 may be a complex-valued,\nor even completely imaginary quantity. This possibility has been the focus of myriad studies, but no unique resolution has been found to date. Indeed, a unique\n\n\fChapter 4. The Formal Theory of Neutron Scattering\n\n61\n\nresolution may not exist, as the details of the scattering geometry or the scattering\npotential may be a factor. Some answers may lie in a higher order treatment of\nthe problem; alternatively, it may be necessary to look into the dynamical theory of\nneutron scattering, which accounts for the possibility of the incident neutron being\nre-scattered within the sample before emerging [110]. These options are not explored\nin the present thesis, but may become the topic of future work.\n\n\fChapter 5\nTwo-Neutron Entanglement via\nScattering\nThis chapter considers two alternative realizations of the neutron entanglement\nscheme outlined in chapter 3. In order of discussion, these are: (i) scattering at\nzero momentum transfer from a sample in a single magnon state; (ii) scattering\nat zero momentum transfer from a sample containing no spin excitations. In each\ncase, the performance of the system in zero and finite field is analyzed. After describing the quantum state of the system at each stage of the protocol, I will discuss\nthe behaviour of the entanglement between the neutrons as a function of the input\nparameters. It will emerge that, for certain combinations of these parameters, the\nconcurrence attains high values. Furthermore, the concurrence proves independent\nof the time of free evolution \u03c4f\u2032 between scattering events. To investigate this property further, I will compare the time-evolution of the concurrence to that of the\nlogarithmic negativity, which is not independent of \u03c4f\u2032 . I then discuss parallels with\nthe optical entanglement scheme proposed by Haroche et al.

First, the\nconcurrence does not depend on the time between scattering events \u03c4f\u2032 . This is essential for the purpose of experimental implementation, because \u03c4f\u2032 cannot be tuned.\nIn zero field, this invariance follows from the fact that the sample Hamiltonian H0\nis a multiple of the identity. In finite field the interpretation is more complex, as we\nwill see.\nSecond, the concurrence is an oscillating function of time, whose periodicity is determined by the cosine function cos(2\u03c6\u03c4 ):\nT\u03c6 (N, \u03bb, Bz ) =\n\n\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n=q\n\u0001\n2\u03c6\nBz2 \u2212 2Bz \u03bb 1 \u2212 N1 + 1 +\n\n\u0001\n1 2\nN\n\n.\n\n(5.28)\n\n\u03bb2\n\n\u2032\nThe quantity 2\u03c6 is the energy splitting of the eigenstates of Hm\ncorresponding to\nthe spin-flip being shared between the interacting neutron and the sample. There-\n\nfore, during each scattering event the system oscillates between states |2i and |4i\n(|6i), in which the spin flip is localized on the sample or the first (second) neutron,\nrespectively. This is a promising beginning, as it suggests there will be times at\nwhich some entanglement is present in the system. To verify how this entanglement\nis distributed, however, we must focus in detail on the behaviour of the concurrence\nas a function of time, spin density and magnetic field.\n\n\f67\n\nChapter 5. Two-Neutron Entanglement via Scattering\n\n5.1.1\n\nZero-Field Evolution\n\nIf the applied field is zero, equation (5.27) becomes\n\nC(N, \u03bb, \u03c4 ) =\n\n\u0002\n8N sin2 \u03bb 1 +\n\n1\nN\n\n\u0002\n\u0001 \u0003q\nN 2 + 1 + 2N cos 2\u03bb 1 +\n\u03c4\n(N + 1)3\n\n1\nN\n\n\u0001 \u0003\n\u03c4\n\n.\n\n(5.29)\n\nAt fixed N and \u03bb, the only free parameter in this expression is the interaction time.\nMaximizing with respect to \u03c4 and neglecting un-physical solutions yields\n\u03c4\u2217 =\n\n\u03c0\n2\u03bb 1 +\n\n1\nN\n\n\u0001\u2261\n\nT\u03c6 (N, \u03bb, 0)\n,\n2\n\n(5.30)\n\nhence in zero field the optimal interaction time is half the oscillation period. The\npeak concurrence Cp is then found to be\nCp (N, \u03bb, \u03c4 \u2217 ) =\n\n8N(N \u2212 1)\n.\n(N + 1)3\n\n(5.31)\n\nIt is evident from equation (5.31) that Cp falls as N increases, converging to a value\n8/N as N \u2192 \u221e (fig. 5.1). This phenomenon can be explained in terms of the\nconcurrence of the first neutron and the sample prior to the second scattering event,\nwhich is\n\nC1 (N, \u03bb, \u03c4 ) =\n\n\u221a\n4 N | sin[\u03bb 1 +\n\n1\nN\n\n\u0001\n\nq\n\u03c4 ]| N 2 + 1 + 2N cos[2\u03bb 1 +\n(N + 1)2\n\n1\nN\n\n\u0001\n\n\u03c4]\n\n.\n\n(5.32)\n\nThe maximum value of C1 drops with N as N \u22121 . The behaviour of Cp therefore\nstems from the fact that the total amount of 'available' entanglement falls as the\nnumber of spins in the sample becomes large.\n\n\f68\n\nChapter 5.

All quantities are expressed in natural\nunits.\n\n5.1.2\n\nFinite-Field Evolution\n\nWe conclude from the previous section that if no field is applied there is a limit to\nthe amount of information the sample can store; but is this true in finite field also?\nAnd if not, is there an optimal field value? To answer this question, let us consider\nthe first scattered state. The success of the protocol relies on the system being as\nentangled as possible before the second scattering event. From equation (5.19), the\nstate |\u03c82A i is maximally entangled if\n1\n2c2 (1 \u2212 c2 )(1 \u2212 cos 2\u03c6\u03c4 ) = .\n2\n\n(5.33)\n\nIf this is true, the derivative of equation (5.33) with respect to c must vanish.\nTherefore\n4c2 (1 \u2212 2c2 )(1 \u2212 cos 2\u03c6\u03c4 ) = 0.\n\n(5.34)\n\nThe only reasonable solution to this equation is c = \u00b1 \u221a12 , hence d = \u00b1 \u221a12 also.\nTherefore, the concurrence of the neutrons is maximized when the eigenstates of\nthe interaction Hamiltonian in the single-excitation sector correspond to the spin-\n\nflip being equally shared between the interacting neutron and the sample.

As we will see, Bz\u2217 represents the optimal field\nvalue for input state |\u03c80B i also, because in both cases the first scattered state can\nbe written in terms of eigenstates formally equivalent to |1i and |2i.\nSubstituting Bz = Bz\u2217 into equation (5.27), the concurrence takes on a particularly\nsimple form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\u03bb\u03c4\n2\u03bb\u03c4\n\u2217\n2\nCp (N, \u03bb, Bz , \u03c4 ) = 2 sin \u221a\ncos \u221a\n.\n(5.36)\nN\nN\nThis is now easily maximized with respect to \u03c4 to yield\n\u221a\n\n\u0012 \u0013\nN\n1\n\u22121\n\u03c4 =\n\u2212\n.\ncos\n4\u03bb\n3\n\u2217\n\n(5.37)\n\nFor all values of N, the peak concurrence between the neutrons is now fixed at 0.77\n(fig. 5.2).

Inside this\nrange, however, \u03c4B and T\u03c6 /2 no longer coincide and the concurrence develops a\ndouble-peaked structure, showing a higher frequency oscillation modulated by an\nenvelope with period T\u03c6 . The limits of this range are found by calculating when the\nequality \u03c4B = T\u03c6 /2 ceases to apply. This yields the interval Bz \u2208 [Bz\u2212 , Bz+ ] shown\nin figure 5.4(b), with\nBz\u2212\n\n1\n\u2212\n= \u03bb 1\u2212\nN\n\nr\n\n2\nN\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(5.42)\n\nBz+\n\n1\n+\n= \u03bb 1\u2212\nN\n\nr\n\n2\nN\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(5.43)\n\nThe peak concurrence outside and inside this interval then takes on the form\n\nCo (N, \u03bb, Bz ) =\nCi (N, \u03bb, Bz ) =\n\nq\n\u221a\n8 2\u03bb2 |\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6| \u03c6\u03c6 \u2212\nN\u03c63 \u03c6\n\n4\n\u221a ,\n3 3\n\n2\u03bb2\nN\n\n,\n\n(5.44)\n(5.45)\n\nEquations (5.31), (5.44) and (5.45) then show the peak concurrence is always improved by applying a field, provided this does not exceed an upper limit of Bz =\n\u0001\n2\u03bb 1 \u2212 N1 (fig. 5.4).\nTo summarize: if the system is initialized to a single magnon state, with the spin-flip\n\nlocalized on the sample, the concurrence of the scattered neutrons is an oscillating\nfunction of time, which ranges from zero to a maximum of 0.77. In zero applied\nfield, the oscillation is sinusoidal, and its amplitude falls as the spin density of the\nsample increases. The same result applies if the field lies outside a certain interval\n[Bz\u2212 , Bz+ ]. Conversely, if the field lies within this interval, it is always possible to\n\n\f72\n\nChapter 5.

We note that:\n1. The concurrence does not depend on the duration of the period of free evolution\nbetween scattering events.\n2. The concurrence is an oscillating function of interaction time.\n3. The period of the oscillation is defined by the energy splitting of the singleexcitation eigenstates that correspond to the spin flip being shared between\nthe interacting neutron and the sample.\n4. The amplitude of the oscillation decays as the density of the sample increases.\n\n\f76\n\nChapter 5. Two-Neutron Entanglement via Scattering\n\nTherefore, the behaviour of the system mirrors that observed for input state |\u03c80A i,\nexcept the peak concurrence for input state |\u03c80B i is considerably lower for all N and\nseems to decay more slowly as the number of spins in the sample increases.\nHbL\n\nHaL\n\n0.10\n\n0.14\n0.08\n\n0.12\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\nC\n\nC\n\n0.10\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\n0.02\n0.00\n\n0.00\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0.0\n\n5\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n\u03a4'f\n\n\u03a4\n\nHcL\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\nCp\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nN\n\nFigure 5.5: Input state |\u03c80B i, Q = 0, Bz = 0, \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u221a12 , \u03bb = 1.

All quantities are expressed in natural units.\n\nThe only outstanding question is then the relationship between the concurrence and\nthe neutron polarization. Figure 5.6 shows the peak concurrence as a function of \u03b1\nfor different values of N, and clearly illustrates that, for each N, the concurrence\nis non-zero for a specific range of \u03b1.

The optimal neutron polarization is the latter. All quantities\nare expressed in natural units.\n\nThe absence of entanglement when \u03b1 = 1 is evidently due to the fact that when the\nneutron spin is parallel to the positive z-axis the input state is an eigenstate of the\ninteraction Hamiltonian. To explain why similar behaviour is observed at \u03b1 = 0, it\nis useful to examine the state of the system at the different stages of the protocol.\nThe first scattered state can be written as |\u03c82B i = \u0393|7i + \u2206|8i, and for the protocol\nto succeed this state must be entangled. The concurrence of the first neutron and\nthe sample can be expressed in closed form as\n\u221a\nC1 = 2|\u0393\u2206| = 4\n\nN | sin [\u03bb 1 +\n\n1\nN\n\n\u0001\n\nq\n\u03c4 ]| N 2 + 1 + 2N cos [2\u03bb 1 +\n(N + 1)2\n\n1\nN\n\n\u0001\n\n\u03c4]\n\n,\n\n(5.73)\n\nwhich is once again a regularly oscillating function of \u03c4 with period T\u03c6 . For N > 5,\n\u221a\nC1 peaks at time \u03c4 = T\u03c6 /2 with a maximum value 4 N (N \u2212 1)(N + 1)\u22122 , while for\n\n\fChapter 5. Two-Neutron Entanglement via Scattering\n\n80\n\nN \u2264 5 the peak concurrence reaches unity. We can verify this is true by showing\nthere exist times at which the square moduli of the coefficients of state |\u03c82B i are\nequal to 12 , imposing for instance\n1\n|cd(eix\u03c4 \u2212 eiy\u03c4 )|2 = .\n2\n\n(5.74)\n\nSubstituting the values of c and d and solving for \u03c4 then yields\n1 N\n\u03c4=\nsin\u22121\n\u03bbN +1\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nN +1\n\u221a\n,\n2 2N\n\n(5.75)\n\nwhich has real solutions for N \u2264 5. Hence, the concurrence of the first neutron and\nthe sample does not reach unity for N > 5, but can assume non-zero values for all\nN.\nEvidently, then, it is not the first stage of the protocol that is at fault. Let us\ntherefore consider the state of the system after the second scattering event; this\ntakes the form |\u03c8fB i = \u0398|3i + \u03a5|5i + \u039e|7i + \u03a9|8i. The concurrence of the neutrons\ncan be expressed analytically as C = 2 (|\u03a5\u039e| \u2212 |\u0398\u03a9|), which substituting the zero-\n\nfield values of the coefficients takes the rather complicated form\n\u0002\n8G(N) sin2 \u03bb 1 +\nC=\n(N + 1)4\n\n1\nN\n\n\u0001 \u0003 h\ni\np\n\u03c4\nNF (N) \u2212 2N(N \u2212 1)G(N) ,\n\n(5.76)\n\nwith\ns\n\n\u0013 \u0015\n\u0012\n1\nF (N) =\n\u03c4 ,\n+ 1 + 2N cos 2\u03bb 1 +\nN\ns\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013 \u0015\n1\nN 2 \u2212 2N + 5 + 4 (N \u2212 1) cos 2\u03bb 1 +\nG(N) =\n\u03c4 .\nN\nN2\n\n\u0014\n\n(5.77)\n(5.78)\n\nThe pre-factor to equation (5.76) is always positive. In the limit of large N, the\n\u221a \u0001\nfunction enclosed in square brackets tends to N 2 1 \u2212 2 , which is always negative.\nTherefore, the concurrence between the neutrons must always be null.\nIn summary, if the applied field is zero the concurrence of the neutrons is determined by the spin density of the sample and the neutron polarization. The peak\nconcurrence is maximal when the neutrons are polarized at approximately 60\u25e6 to\n\n\fChapter 5. Two-Neutron Entanglement via Scattering\n\n81\n\nthe quantization axis, but this maximum never exceeds 0.16 and falls roughly as\nN \u22121 .\n\n5.2.2\n\nFinite Field Evolution\n\nLet us now consider the effect of applying a finite field. Bearing in mind the results\nof sections 5.1.2 and 5.2.1, there are several features we might expect to see:\n1. Independence of the concurrence from \u03c4f\u2032 ;\n2. Discontinuities and null concurrence when \u03b1 < \u03b1\u2212 ;\n3. Increase or decrease of the peak concurrence according to the applied field and\nthe neutron polarization;\n4. Maximal concurrence when Bz = Bz\u2217 ;\nThe first point holds for all N and Bz , hence the concurrence is once again independent of the time between scattering events (see fig. 5.9). It is also undoubtedly\ntrue that if \u03b1 = 1 the neutrons must remain unentangled, because the initial state\nof the system is an eigenstate of the interaction potential. In addition, we know\nthe final point must apply, owing to to structure of the potential. The remaining\nitems are easily verified from figures 5.10 and 5.11, which illustrate the evolution of\nthe concurrence in time for different field strengths and polarizations. We observe\nthat, for fixed \u03b1, the peak concurrence Cp improves when a field is applied, provided\nthe strength of the field does not exceed a rough upper limit of 3\u03bb. Surprisingly,\nhowever, the concurrence in finite field is now non-zero for all \u03b1 6= 1.\n\n\f82\n\nChapter 5.

To explain this behaviour, it is instructive to\nanalyze the state of the system at each stage of the protocol. From equation (5.66),\nneglecting the state of the second neutron, the first scattered state |\u03c82B i can be\nwritten as\n\u0001\n\u0001\n|\u03c82B i = \u03b1|00i + \u03b2cd eix\u03c4 \u2212 eiy\u03c4 |01i + \u03b2 d2 eix\u03c4 + c2 eiy\u03c4 |10i.\n\n(5.79)\n\n\fChapter 5. Two-Neutron Entanglement via Scattering\n\n85\n\nEvidently, for a given c and d the entanglement of this state is directly proportional\nto \u03b2, and is maximal if \u03b2 = 1. Therefore, to optimize the first stage of the protocol\nthe neutron spin must be anti-aligned with the z-axis. Let us then assume \u03b2 = 1\nand consider the state of the system after the second scattering event; this has the\nform |\u03c8fB i = \u0398\u2032 |3i + \u03a5\u2032|5i + \u039e\u2032|7i + \u03a9\u2032|8i. As before, the concurrence of the neutrons\nis C = 2 (|\u03a5\u2032 \u039e\u2032 | \u2212 |\u0398\u2032 \u03a9\u2032 |), hence substituting the values of the coefficients at finite\nBz yields\n\n\u0014\n\u221a\np\n32N 3 \u03bb2 \u03b5\n2\u03b5N(N \u2212 1)|\u03c6\u03b8 sin \u03c6\u03c4 sin \u03b3\u03c4 |\nC = \u2212\n(4\u03bb2 + N\u03c62 )3 [8\u03bb2 (N \u2212 1) + N 2 \u03b82 ]\n\uf8f9\ns\u0014\n\u00152\n2\n2\n\u03bb\n8\u03bb (N \u2212 1)\n\u2212 N\u03c62 sin2 \u03c6\u03c4\n+ \u03b82 \u2212 32 (N \u2212 1) \u03b82 2 sin2 \u03b3\u03c4 \uf8fb , (5.80)\n2\nN\nN\nwith\n\n8\u03bb2 2\n16\u03bb4\n4\n+\n\u03c6\n+\n\u03c6 cos 2\u03c6\u03c4 .\n(5.81)\nN2\nN\nBoth terms in the square brackets are always positive. The concurrence will therefore\nbe finite if there exist values of Bz and \u03c4 for which the magnitude of the second\nterm is greater than that of the first. Let us set a lower limit for the concurrence\n\u03b5=\n\nof Cmin = 10\u22123 . For any arbitrarily small value Bz < Bz\u2217 , C exceeds Cmin at\ncertain values of \u03c4 satisfying Bz \u03c4 & 0.1\u03bb. Not all values of \u03c4 described by this\ncondition yield a finite concurrence, because C is not a smooth function of time (fig.\n5.12).

Two-Neutron Entanglement via Scattering\n\nWe conclude that, from a purely mathematical viewpoint, the performance of the\nsystem is optimal when the neutrons are polarized in the negative z-direction. However, in practical terms this may not be the most advantageous choice, because when\nthe field is weak the concurrence at short times is poor. Comparing the evolution\n\u221a\nof the concurrence for different field strengths at \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b1 = 23 illustrates that,\nfor Bz \u03c4 . 2\u03bb, the optimal spin orientation is in fact the latter (fig. 5.14).\nHbL\n\nHaL\n0.4\n0.15\n0.3\n\nC\n\nC\n\n0.10\n\n0.05\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.00\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n0\n\n300\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n\u03a4\n\n\u03a4\n\nHcL\n0.6\n0.5\n\nC\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n\u03a4\n\nFigure 5.14: Input state |\u03c80B i, Q = 0, N = 10, \u03bb = 1.

To explore this\nfurther, let us examine the concurrence for generic \u03b1 and Bz ; this is illustrated\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0002\nin figure 5.15. If the field lies within an interval [Bz\u2212 , Bz+ ] \u2248 \u03bb2 , 2\u03bb 1 + N1 , no\n\nevident systematic behaviour is observed. Conversely, if Bz is outside this interval\nthere emerges a pattern which resembles a high frequency oscillation modulated by\na low frequency envelope. The period of the rapidly oscillating component is the\n\n\fChapter 5. Two-Neutron Entanglement via Scattering\n\n88\n\nfamiliar quantity T\u03c6 . The period of the envelope function is defined by\nT\u03b3 =\n\n\u03c0\n,\n|\u03c6 \u2212 \u03b3|\n\n(5.83)\n\nwhere \u03b3 \u2261 \u03b3 ex (N, \u03bb, Bz ). The behaviour of the system is therefore determined\n\nby the beating of four eigenstates, of which two correspond to the spin-flip being\nshared between the first neutron and the sample, and two correspond to the spin-flip\nbeing shared between the second neutron and the sample. The optimal interaction\ntime can then be estimated by tracking the evolution of the peaks of the envelope\nfunction.\n\n\f89\n\nChapter 5.

The emergence of a beating effect\nin the evolution of the concurrence as a function of interaction time.

All quantities are expressed in natural units.\n\nIn summary, when a field is applied the peak concurrence always increases, provided\nthe field does not exceed an upper limit. This limit depends on the neutron polarization, but is generally of order 4\u03bb. For a given field, Cp is a maximum when the\nneutron spin is anti-aligned with the quantization axis. If the field lies outside the\ninterval [Bz\u2212 , Bz+ ] this maximum occurs at approximately \u03c4 = T\u03b3 /2. However, if\nthe field is weak then T\u03b3 is large, hence at short times the system performs better\n\n\fChapter 5. Two-Neutron Entanglement via Scattering\n\n90\n\nif both \u03b1 and \u03b2 are non-zero. If the field lies within the interval [Bz\u2212 , Bz+ ] the\nbehaviour of the concurrence is more difficult to predict, but setting Bz = Bz\u2217 and\n\u03b1 = 0 the concurrence takes on a well-defined analytical form and peaks at predictable times. For N \u2265 5 the peak value exceeds 0.7, and converges to 0.77 as\nN becomes large. The performance of the system at zero momentum transfer for\ninput state |\u03c80B i therefore matches in efficiency that observed for input state |\u03c80A i,\n\nalthough its behaviour is overall more complex and less predictable.\n\n5.3\n\nConcurrence and Negativity\n\nOne of the most interesting properties of the neutron concurrence is the invariance\nwith respect to the second period of free evolution. In zero field, this arises from the\nform of the free Hamiltonian H0 . In finite field, however, H0 is no longer a multiple of\nthe identity, nor does it commute with H1 or H2 ; therefore the explanation is not as\nevident. To gain insight on the origin of this behaviour, it is useful to investigate its\ndependence on the structure of the interaction potential. Specifically, let us focus on\nthe second scattering event. One finds that, provided the interaction Hamiltonian is\nhermitian and displays an excitation number conserving symmetry, the concurrence\nis always independent of the second period of free evolution. It would therefore\nseem that the sample behaves as an 'entanglement safety-deposit box', which holds\nthe spin information deposited by the first scattering event until a second neutron\nbearing the right 'key' comes along to claim it. In other words, the entanglement\nbetween the neutrons is conditional on the second scattering event being able to\n'undo' -in part or in full- the transformation on the sample spin precipitated by the\nthe arrival of the first neutron.\nIt is interesting to ask whether the invariance with \u03c4f\u2032 extends to all entanglement\nmeasures. Figure 5.16 illustrates the evolution of the logarithmic negativity during\nthe second period of free evolution for input state |\u03c80B i, and reveals a definite vari-\n\nation with \u03c4f\u2032 . The discrepancy between the concurrence and the negativity may\narise from the difference in the physical significance of the two quantities: given an\n\narbitrarily large number of maximally entangled states, the concurrence quantifies\nthe entanglement cost of generating an arbitrary state \u03c1 under local operations and\nclassical communication, whereas the negativity quantifies the entanglement cost of\n\n\f91\n\nChapter 5. Two-Neutron Entanglement via Scattering\n\ngenerating an arbitrary state \u03c1 under positive-partial-transpose-preserving operations. The dependence of the negativity on \u03c4f\u2032 then becomes a useful indicator of\nthe inequivalence of the two classes of operations.\nHaL\n\nHbL\n\n0.20\n\n0.050\n\n0.045\nC\n\nC\n\n0.15\n\n0.10\n\n0.040\n\n0.05\n0.035\n0.00\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0\n\n20\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n\u03a4'f\n\n\u03a4'f\n\nHcL\n0.30\n0.25\n\nN\n\n0.20\n0.15\n0.10\n0.05\n0.00\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\n0.30\n\nC\n\nFigure 5.16: Input state |\u03c80B i, Q = 0, Bz = 0.35, N = 10, \u03b1 = \u221a16 , \u03bb = 1.

Almost ten years ago, a group led by Haroche\nof the Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS) reported the generation of EPR pairs of\n\n\f92\n\nChapter 5. Two-Neutron Entanglement via Scattering\n\natoms via the exchange of a single photon in a high-Q cavity according to the\nfollowing scheme [114]. A single atom is prepared in an excited state |ei and is\nmade to interact with a cavity in its ground state. Assuming the cavity and the\natom exchange photons at a rate \u03a9, after a period of time \u03c41 =\nstate of the atom and the cavity becomes\n\n\u03c0\n2\u03a9\n\nthe combined\n\n1\n|\u03c81 i = \u221a (|e0i + |g1i) ,\n2\n\n(5.84)\n\nwhere the right-most number refers to the photon number inside the cavity. After a\ndelay time \u03c42 , a second atom, this time prepared in its ground state |gi, is made to\n\ninteract with the cavity for a period \u03c43 , which is twice the duration of \u03c41 . If the first\natom has emitted a photon, the second atom becomes excited; otherwise it remains\nin |gi. As a result, the composite state of the system is\n1\n|\u03c82 i = \u221a (|ge0i + |eg0i) ,\n2\n\n(5.85)\n\nwhich is a maximally entangled state of the atoms.\nIt is shown in figure 5.17 that if the ENS protocol were exactly mapped to the\nscattering scheme I have described, it would be possible to generate fully entangled\nneutron states. Indeed, if we restrict ourselves to the single excitation subspace by\nworking with input state |\u03c80A i, near unit concurrence is achieved when \u03c43 = 2\u03c41\n\n[figure 5.17(a)]. However, such a mapping requires the possibility of separately\ntuning the interaction times of consecutive neutrons, which is not currently possible.\nTherefore, to compare the ENS protocol and the scattering scheme on a more even\n\nfooting, it is useful to examine the evolution of state |ee0i, which is contextually\nequivalent to state |8i \u2261 |110i of the Bloch basis, for equal interaction times \u03c41 = \u03c43 .\n\nIn this case, the concurrence of the atoms is given by\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u221a\n\u221a\nCh = 2 cos2 \u039b\u03c4 | sin 2\u039b\u03c4 sin \u039b\u03c4 | \u2212 sin2 \u039b\u03c4 | cos 2\u039b\u03c4 cos \u039b\u03c4 | .\n\n(5.86)\n\nThis expression peaks at a value 0.77 for \u03c4 \u2248 3\u03c0\n, and, as we will see, greatly\n\u039b\nresembles the evolution of the concurrence in optimal field for input state |8i, when\nscattering takes place from an anisotropic sample [see equation (5.118) and section\n5.7].

All quantities are expressed in natural units.\n\n5.5\n\nExperimental Feasibility\n\nFrom the results presented so far in this chapter, it would seem that the scattering\nprotocol of chapter 3 offers a valid means of creating entanglement between distinct\nneutrons. The question to ask is therefore: can it be done? Let us review the\nquantitative requirements of the protocol:\n1. The spin lattice relaxation time (T1 ) must be longer than the first period of\nfree evolution, which roughly coincides with the time taken by the neutrons\nto reach the sample;\n2. The phase coherence time (T2 ) must be longer than the period of free evolution\nbetween scattering events;\n3. The neutron coherence volume must be comparable to the size of the sample;\n4. The optimal field B \u2217 and the optimal interaction time \u03c4 \u2217 must be attainable\nvalues;\n5. The protocol must be robust against experimental uncertainties;\n\n\fChapter 5. Two-Neutron Entanglement via Scattering\n\n94\n\n6. The final state of the neutrons must yield a measurable witness.\nTo address these points, I take as a reference the technical specifications of the PF2\nsource of UCNs at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble (see Appendix B\nand [100]).\nFor UCNs with velocity v = 7 ms\u22121 and a flight path of 10\u22122 \u2212 1 m, the time taken\n\nto reach the sample is of order 10\u22122 \u2212 1 s. T1 times consistent with these figures\nare achievable in materials such as phosphorus-doped silicon or N@C60 [116, 117].\nFurthermore, for a neutron flux F = 108 m\u22122 s\u22121 and a sample area of, say, 10\u22122 m2 ,\nthe time between scatterings might be of order 10\u22126 s. T2 times similar to this are\nalso attainable in these systems at low temperature [116].\nNext, we require the neutron coherence volume to be comparable to the size of the\nsample. This condition is expressed by the uncertainty relation of equation (3.6),\nwhich in terms of the neutron velocity becomes\n\u2206v =\n\n~\n.\nmN \u2206L\n\n(5.87)\n\nFor a sample of length \u2206L = 10 cm, \u2206v is of order 10\u22127 ms\u22121 . For neutrons traveling\nat 7 ms\u22121 , therefore\n\u2206v\n\u2248 10\u22128 .\n(5.88)\nv\nCurrently, this is somewhat unrealistic. Resolutions of order 10\u22123 have been achieved\nin the field of neutron spin-echo spectroscopy [118], but this yields coherence lengths\nof only \u2206L \u2248 10\u22126 \u221210\u22125 m. The situation could be improved if the neutron velocity\nwere reduced, which might be achieved by prolonging or improving the efficiency\nof the cooling stage described in Appendix B, or by allowing the neutrons to slow\ndown under the effect of gravity (see below).\nFor the remainder of this discussion, I will consider scattering from a sample in a\nsingle magnon state. To estimate working values of B \u2217 and \u03c4 \u2217 , it is useful to re-write\n\n\fChapter 5. Two-Neutron Entanglement via Scattering\n\n95\n\nequations (5.35) and (5.37) in SI units and take the large N limit:\ngN \u03bcN \u03bc0\nBz\u2217 \u2248 (ge \u03bcB )\u22121 \u03bb =\n,\na30\n\u221a\n\u221a\n~ N\na30 ~ N\n\u2217\n\u03c4 =\n.\n\u2248\n4\u03bb\n4gN \u03bcN \u03bc0 ge \u03bcB\n\n(5.89)\n(5.90)\n\nHence\n\u0010 a \u0011\u22123\n0\nT,\nBz\u2217 \u2248 10\u221232\nm\n\u0010 a \u00113 1\n0\nN 2 s.\n\u03c4 \u2217 \u2248 1020\nm\n\n(5.91)\n(5.92)\n\nAssuming a lattice constant a0 = 10\u221210 m and a macroscopic number of scatterers\nN = 1023 gives an optimal field Bz\u2217 = 10\u22122 T and a sample volume D 3 = 10\u22127 m3 .\nFor these parameters, the neutron velocity is v \u2248 10\u22124 ms\u22121 , corresponding to an\n\ninteraction time \u03c4 \u2217 \u2248 100s. Currently, such low values of v are not attainable. This\nis not a fundamental constraint, but a technical limitation. In principle, UCN could\n\nbe slowed to this energy regime by causing them to decelerate in a gravitational potential [119]: a UCN with v = 7ms\u22121 would stop at a height of approximately 2.5m,\nhaving converted all its kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy. Unfortunately, there are several problems with this approach. First, the neutron absorption\ncross-section is inversely proportional to the neutron velocity. Therefore, the slower\nthe neutrons, the greater the chance they will be absorbed by the scatterer or indeed\nby any other component of the experimental setup. Second, even if it were possible\nto produce such a slow neutron beam, one would expect its intensity to be extremely\nlow. Therefore, it is difficult to see how one could produce enough neutrons in the\nrequired energy range to carry out a statistically significant measurement of the\nwitness (see discussion below on how to measure the witness).\nIt was stated in chapter 3 that the protocol would be deemed successful if the\nneutrons were found to share an amount E of entanglement, corresponding to a\n\nconcurrence CE . I now set CE = 23 , which implies we still consider the protocol\nsuccessful if the concurrence deviates from its optimal value by 0.1. For simplicity,\nthe possibility of simultaneous errors in the field and in the timing will be excluded.\nIn other words, I assume we operate either at optimal field, or at optimal time.\n\n\fChapter 5. Two-Neutron Entanglement via Scattering\n\n96\n\nAt optimal field, the time evolution of the concurrence is described by equation\n(5.36). An acceptable timing error can then be estimated by measuring the halfwidth of this function in the vicinity of \u03c4 \u2217 , at C = CE . For the set of parameters\n\ndefined above, one finds \u03c4 \u2217 \u2248 150 s and \u2206\u03c4 \u2248 \u00b170 s [see fig. 5.18(a)], hence\n\u2206\u03c4\n\u2206v\n=\n\u2248 0.5.\n\u2217\n\u03c4\nv\n\n(5.93)\n\nNote this value does not take into account the restrictions on the neutron coherence\nvolume.\nLet us now fix \u03c4 = \u03c4 \u2217 , and consider the effect of errors in field calibration. The\nconcurrence as a function of applied field is given by equation (5.27). As before, the\nallowed spread in Bz can be estimated from the half-width of the curve at C = CE\naround Bz = Bz\u2217 .

We saw in section 5.1.2\nthat a successful realization of the protocol yields the scattered state \u03c1A\nn of equation (5.40). As expected, the partial transpose of \u03c1A\nn is negative. The eigenvector\ncorresponding to the negative eigenvalue has the form\n|e\u2212 i = a|00i + b|11i,\nwhere both a and b are approximately equal to\n\n\u221a1 .\n2\n\n(5.98)\nIt has been shown that witness\n\noperators constructed from states of this form can be decomposed as follows [67]:\nW = a2 |z + z + ihz + z + | + b2 |z \u2212 z \u2212 ihz \u2212 z \u2212 |\n\n(5.99)\n\u0001\n+ ab |x+ x+ ihx+ x+ | + |x\u2212 x\u2212 ihx\u2212 x\u2212 | \u2212 |y + y \u2212 ihy + y \u2212 | \u2212 |y \u2212 y + ihy \u2212 y + | ,\n\nwhere |x\u00b1 i, |y \u00b1i and |z \u00b1 i are the spin-up and down eigenstates of the Pauli matrices \u03c3x , \u03c3y and \u03c3z , respectively. Such a witness could be measured with as few as\nthree device settings, provided one could detect all outgoing neutrons and measure\neach component of their spin. A Stern-Gerlach experiment in an arbitrary direction\nwould achieve this objective. Bearing in mind the stochasticity of existing neutron\nsources, hW i could then be evaluated on pairs of neutrons detected in rapid succession following a gap long enough to reset the sample state. This is conceptually\npossible, though very challenging from a technical viewpoint.\n\n\f98\n\nChapter 5. Two-Neutron Entanglement via Scattering\n\n5.6\n\nScattering from an Anisotropic Medium in a\nSingle Magnon State\n\nWe have assumed so far that the sample is an isotropic medium. This is reflected in\nthe form of the interaction Hamiltonian of equation (5.1), which is proportional to an\nelectronic g-factor with equal components ge along all three axes. In general terms,\nthe g-factor is a tensor with diagonal elements gx , gy and gz , whose magnitude can\nvary in space according to the chemical nature of the environment, or the presence of\nexternal fields. This property is of great relevance in the field of spintronics, which\nexploits g-tensor anisotropies to manipulate electron spins using electrical signals\n[123]. It is then interesting to explore how the scattering scheme might perform\nif the sample were anisotropic. To describe this situation accurately, one would\nhave to account for the possible breakdown of the LS model. However, as a very\nbasic approximation, we can assume LS coupling still holds, and simply choose a\ng-tensor with unequal components along the three spatial directions. Let us choose\nan extreme example: gx = gy = ge , and gz = 0. In this limit, one might imagine a\nspin potential of the form\nV sxy = V0 + \u039b\n\nsxm\n\nN\nX\nj=1\n\nsxj + sym\n\nN\nX\nj=1\n\nsyj\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(5.100)\n\nAs before, this can be expressed in terms of an 'effective' interaction potential similar\nto equation (5.2), provided one takes the correct form for Vm . Quantitatively, V sxy\ndiffers from V sex because it lacks a diagonal component; hence the diagonal elements\n\u2032\nof Hm\nare simply those of H0B . As a result, the equations describing the states of\nthe system in the different stages of the protocol are identical to (5.19), (5.20) and\n\n\f99\n\nChapter 5. Two-Neutron Entanglement via Scattering\n\n(5.24), provided one sets\nxy\n\n\u03c6 \u2261 \u03c6 (N, \u03bb, Bz ) =\n\u039b = Bz (N \u2212 1) \u2212 \u03c6,\ns\n1 Bz\nc =\n+\n,\n2 2\u03c6\ns\n1 Bz\nd = \u2212\n\u2212\n,\n2 2\u03c6\n\nr\n\nBz2 +\n\n4\u03bb2\n,\nN\n\ny = Bz + \u03c6.\nThe concurrence between the neutrons is then\nr\n4\u03bb2\n8\u03bb2 sin2 \u03c6\u03c4\n2 +\ncos2 \u03c6\u03c4 .\nB\nC(N, \u03bb, Bz , \u03c4 ) =\nz\nN\u03c63\nN\n\n(5.101)\n(5.102)\n(5.103)\n(5.104)\n(5.105)\n\n(5.106)\n\nThere are striking similarities between this and equation (5.27). First, (5.106) is an\noscillating function of the interaction time, and independent of the time between\nscattering events \u03c4f\u2032 . The period of the oscillation has the form of equation (5.28),\nwith the value of \u03c6 given by equation (5.101). Second, (5.106) reduces to the form of\n(5.36) if the field is set to zero, suggesting the concurrence is maximal when there is\nno applied field. Indeed, as discussed in section 5.1.2, at Bz = 0 the single excitation\neigenstates of H1\u2032 are reduced to equally weighted superpositions.\nIn zero field, the evolution of the concurrence in time shows the familiar doublepeaked structure observed in figure 5.2. This structure disappears when the applied\nfield exceeds a certain threshold, to be replaced with a sinusoidal oscillation [fig.\n5.19(a)]. To determine the threshold field we repeat the analysis of section 5.1.2,\nmaximizing equation (5.106) with respect to \u03c4 and imposing equality with half the\noscillation period T\u03c6 /2 [fig. 5.19(b)]. One finds\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nNBz2 + \u03bb2\n1\n\u22121\n\u2212\n,\ncos\n\u03c4B =\n2\u03c6\n3\u03bb2\n\n(5.107)\n\nwhich reduces to the form of (5.37) when Bz = 0. From equations (5.101), (5.107)\n\n\fChapter 5. Two-Neutron Entanglement via Scattering\n\n100\n\nand (5.28), the threshold field Bt is then\n\u221a\n2\u03bb\nBt = \u221a .\nN\n\n(5.108)\n\nSubstituting into equation (5.106), the peak concurrence above and below Bz = Bt\ncan therefore be expressed by the following:\n8Bz \u03bb2\n,\nN\u03c63\n4\nC\u2212 (N, \u03bb, Bz ) = \u221a .\n3 3\nC+ (N, \u03bb, Bz ) =\n\n(5.109)\n(5.110)\n\nThis is illustrated in figure 5.19(c). The trends described by (5.109) and (5.110)\nare qualitatively similar to those observed for an isotropic sample. Apart from the\nobvious equivalence of Ci and C\u2212 at optimal field, the behaviour of C+ strongly\n\nresembles that of Co for Bz > Bz+ , and both tend to the same limit as Bz \u2192 \u221e\n[fig. 5.19(d)].\nTo summarize: if the system is initialized to a single magnon state, with the spin-flip\nlocalized on the sample, the concurrence of the scattered neutrons is an oscillating\nfunction of time, which ranges from zero to a maximum of 0.77. Above a threshold\nfield Bt , the oscillation is sinusoidal, and its amplitude falls as with N. Below this\nthreshold, the concurrence can always be boosted to the peak value. The only salient\ndifference between scattering from an isotropic or anisotropic sample therefore lies\nin the value of the optimal field, which is finite in the former case, but zero in the\nlatter.\n\n\f101\n\nChapter 5.

Note the concurrence is finite for all \u03b1 6= 1. All quantities are expressed\nin natural units.\n\nThe behaviour of the concurrence in finite field is more complex. For all \u03b1, N and\nBz the concurrence is an oscillating function of time. At Bz . \u03bb, the oscillation\nis irregular and lacks an easily discernible periodicity, but the peak concurrence\nremains roughly constant with Bz . Conversely, for Bz & \u03bb, there emerges a beating\neffect similar to that observed in figure 5.15 for Bz > Bz+ and Bz < Bz\u2212 (see figure\n\n\fChapter 5. Two-Neutron Entanglement via Scattering\n\n106\n\n5.22). The timescales involved are once again T\u03c6 (rapid oscillation) and T\u03b3 (envelope\nfunction), with \u03c6 \u2261 \u03c6xy and \u03b3 \u2261 \u03b3 xy . In this range of Bz , the concurrence drops\nrapidly with increasing field (figure 5.23). Bearing in mind the form of c and d,\nthis is due to the fact that, as the field is raised, the single-excitation eigenstates of\nthe potential deviate increasingly from being equal superpositions. Indeed, by the\nsame argument the concurrence at fixed Bz increases with increasing N. For all Bz ,\nthe peak concurrence is strongly related to the neutron polarization, and attains a\nmaximum when \u03b1 = 0. The concurrence in this case takes the form\nq\n2\n2\n8\u03bb Bz2 + 2\u03bb\n[1 + cos 2\u03c6\u03c4 ] \u0002\nN\nC =\nN sin2 \u03c6\u03c4 \u2212\nN 2 \u03b3\u03c63\ns\n#\n\u0015\n\u0014\n2\n2\u03bb\n(1 + cos 2\u03c6\u03c4 ) | sin \u03c6\u03c4 sin \u03b3\u03c4 | .

I have considered forward scattering from an\nisotropic or strongly anisotropic sample. In both cases, the system must be initialized to a well-defined state, chosen such that the sample contains at most one spin\nexcitation. More freedom is permitted in the choice of the neutron states, however\nthere does exist an optimal polarization, which is determined by the initial state\nof the sample and the magnitude of the external magnetic field. It must also be\npossible to tune the time each neutron spends interacting with the sample. This\ncan be done by regulating the neutron velocity. Provided these conditions can be\n\n\fChapter 5. Two-Neutron Entanglement via Scattering\n\n109\n\nmet, the neutrons can come to share as much as 0.68 ebits of entanglement.\nIn light of present-day achievements across the range of disciplines employing the\ntools and methods I have discussed, a realization of the entanglement scheme in its\npresent form does not seem feasible. However, future progress in neutron cooling\nand manipulation may change this state of affairs.\nLeaving aside for a moment the problem of producing neutrons with sufficiently large\ncoherence volumes, the most difficult part of the protocol is the entanglement detection stage. Evaluating the witness of equation (5.99) involves measuring expectation\nvalues of the polarizations of the scattered neutrons along all three axes. Currently\noperating neutron spectrometers are capable of full XYZ polarization analysis [124],\nbut with two limitations. First, for a given scattering event, it is only possible to\nmeasure the spin of the outgoing neutrons along one axis - either X, Y or Z. Second,\nonly neutrons with spin in one direction along the chosen axis are detected. For\nexample, suppose one had a beam of scattered neutrons containing a mixture of\nparticles with spin up or down along the \u1e91-direction, and wished to measure the\nz-component of the spin of each neutron. One could either set the analyzer to detect\nneutrons with spin up or to detect neutrons with spin down. If the setting were\nchosen as spin up, none of the neutrons with spin down would be detected. Instead,\nthe relative occurrence of spin up and down in the beam would be inferred by relating the measured flux to the total expected scattered flux. Now, for the purposes\nof measuring the witness of equation (5.99), this is not a problem until one comes\nto the term in |y +y \u2212 ihy +y \u2212 | + hc, which can only be measured reliably if both the\nscattered neutrons are detected. It may then be necessary to employ more than one\nmeasurement strategy to evaluate the witness. One might, for example, measure\nthe first four components using a spectrometer such as D7, currently in operation at\nthe ILL [124], and measure the final two by routing the scattered neutrons through\na rotated Stern-Gerlach apparatus. This would certainly be extremely challenging,\nbut is not a priori impossible.\n\n\fChapter 6\nMany-Neutron Scattering\nIn this chapter, I extend the protocol described in chapter 3 to study the concurrence\nof an arbitrary pair of neutrons scattered from the sample. Once again, I consider\nsequential scattering at zero momentum transfer from a sample in one of two possible states - the polarized, and single-magnon states of equations (3.13) and (3.15). I\nfind that, under optimal circumstances, pairs of neutrons can share a finite concurrence even if they are not scattered in succession. It is therefore possible to create\nentangled states of many neutrons; in fact, for certain choices of input parameters,\nthe amount of entanglement of any neutron with any other becomes a slowly-varying\nfunction of the neutron indices. Consequently, the probability of creating an entangled neutron pair is high, provided the sample can be periodically reset to its initial\nstate. In addition, measurement of the witness is no longer subject to the constraint\nof detecting the first two scattered neutrons.\n\n6.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nI showed in the previous chapter that, conditional on some limitations, the first two\nneutrons to scatter from a sample prepared in a specific eigenstate of its internal\nHamiltonian can be measurably entangled. For an optimal realization of the protocol, this entanglement is detected by the witness operator of equation (5.99), whose\nexpectation value is calculated on the states of the two outgoing neutrons. As the\n\n110\n\n\fChapter 6. Many-Neutron Scattering\n\n111\n\nneutron scattering cross-section is small, if the beam is sufficiently dilute and the\nsample state is periodically reset, it is reasonable to assume the first two neutrons\ndetected in rapid succession following a reset pulse are indeed the first two neutrons\nto scatter from the sample.\nBut what if this were not the case? Equation (5.99) represents a particularly simple\ndecomposition of a generic witness operator capable of detecting the entanglement of\nquantum states having some overlap with the state p|01i+q|10i. This decomposition\nis valid provided the eigenvector corresponding to the negative eigenvalue of the\npartially-transposed density matrix of the neutrons has the form a|00i + b|11i. The\nstate \u03c1A of equation (5.40) falls into this category, however the state \u03c1m,n of two\narbitrary scattered neutrons m and n may not. This means the witness in its\npresent form is no longer guaranteed to detect the entanglement of \u03c1m,n . In addition,\ndetection of the wrong neutron pair could lead to an inaccurate assessment of the\nperformance of the protocol. Suppose, for example, that \u03c11,2 is entangled, but \u03c12,3 is\nnot. By accidentally detecting the second and third neutrons, rather than the first\nand the second, we might conclude the protocol has failed, whereas in fact it has\nsucceeded.\nIt may then be useful to know exactly how much rests on the ability to detect the\nfirst two neutrons. To this end, I study the concurrence Cm,n of an arbitrary neutron\npair m and n, and calculate the average concurrence over all detected neutron pairs\n{m, n}.\n\n6.2\n\nScattering from a Sample in a Single Magnon\nState\n\nWe saw in section 5.1 that when the system is initialized to |\u03c80A i, quantum state\nevolution is restricted to the single excitation sector of the Hilbert space. This\nallows the concurrence of the scattered neutrons, and the behaviour of the system\nin general, to be described in terms of analytical expressions, making clear how\nthe performance of the protocol is affected by changing the input parameters. The\nsame argument applies to the situation we now wish to describe. By deriving the\nstate of the system after the first few scattering events, with the help of equation\n\n\f112\n\nChapter 6. Many-Neutron Scattering\n\n(3.32), there quickly emerges a pattern in the coefficients of the scattered state. This\npattern allows us to extrapolate the form of the wavefunction, hence of the reduced\ndensity matrix of a chosen neutron pair, after an arbitrary number of scattering\nevents. I will spare the reader a detailed account of this derivation, as it is completely\nstraightforward but very lengthy. Suffice it to say that, omitting global phase factors,\none finds the first four scattered states of the system as a whole to be\n|\u03c81 i = P |01i + Q|10i;\n\n(6.1)\n\n|\u03c82 i = P 2 |001i + Qes |010i + R|100i;\n\n(6.2)\n\n|\u03c83 i = P 3 |0001i + Qe2s |0010i + Res |0100i + QP 2 |1000i;\n\n(6.3)\n\n|\u03c84 i = P 4 |00001i + Qe3s |00010i + Re2s |00100i\n+ QP 2 es |01000i + QP 3 es |10000i;\n\n(6.4)\n\nwith\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n+ Bz + \u03c6,\ns=\u03bb 1+\nN\n\n(6.5)\n\nP = c2 + d2 e\u22122i\u03c6\u03c4 ,\n\n(6.6)\n\n\u0001\nQ = cd 1 \u2212 e\u22122i\u03c6\u03c4 ,\n\u0001\nR = c3 d 1 \u2212 e\u22124i\u03c6\u03c4 .\n\n(6.7)\n(6.8)\n\nThe basis I have used is an extension of the Bloch basis, where the right-most qubit\nrepresents the state of the sample and all qubits to the left of this label the neutrons,\ndisposed in order of arrival from right to left. It then becomes clear that scattering\na fifth neutron from the sample will produce the state\n|\u03c85 i = P 5 |000001i + Qe4s |000010i + Re3s |000100i\n\n+ QP 2 e2s |001000i + QP 3 es |010000i + QP 4 |100000i.\n\n(6.9)\n\nTherefore, the general state |\u03c8N i can be written as\nN\n\n(N \u22122)s\n\n|\u03c8N i = P |1i + e\n\nR|4i +\n\nN\nX\n\ni=1, i6=2\n\nQP i\u22121 e(N \u2212i)s |2i i,\n\n(6.10)\n\n\f113\n\nChapter 6. Many-Neutron Scattering\n\nwhere the number inside the ket represents the binary value of the state in a singlespin-flip basis.\nIn theory, knowing the form of the |\u03c8i i provides a means to calculate the reduced\n\ndensity matrix \u03c1m,n of any neutron pair, hence the concurrence Cm,n of that pair.\nAt first glance, this appears to be quite a task, however things are much simpler\nthan they seem. One finds from numerical simulations that the concurrence of any\nneutron and any other can be related to the concurrence of the first neutron and\nthose scattered after. Therefore, one can obtain from the set of density matrices \u03c11,n\nall the information necessary to provide a full characterization of the concurrence\ndynamics of any neutron pair.\nIt can be shown that, for all n, the structure of \u03c11,n in the canonical basis is of the\nform\n\u03c11,n\n\n\uf8eb\n\np 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0 q\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0 r\u2217\n\uf8ed\n0 0\n\n\uf8f6\n0 0\n\uf8f7\nr 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\ns 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n0 0\n\nwhere the coefficients p, q, r and s are obtained from the |\u03c8i i by tracing over\nall neutrons save the first and the nth . From the eigenvalues of the spin-flipped\ncounterpart of \u03c11,n , the concurrence C1,n is\n\u221a\nC1,n = 2 qs,\n\n(6.11)\n\nC1,n (N, \u03bb, Bz , \u03c4 ) = 2 P n\u22121 |Q|2 ,\n\n(6.12)\n\n2\n\nwith qs = |P n\u22121| |Q|4 . Therefore\n\nas P and Q are in general functions of N, \u03bb, Bz and \u03c4 . Finally, from numerical\nstudies, one finds for the concurrence of an arbitrary neutron pair {m, n}\nCm,n = C1,m+n\u22121 .\n\n(6.13)\n\nThis equation reveals two interesting properties of our system. First, at fixed m,\nthe concurrence Cm,n will always fall as |m \u2212 n| increases.

Second, the concurrence of a given pair of neutrons not scattered\nin succession is optimal if one of those neutrons is the first.\nLet us now consider how Cm,n is affected by the neutron interaction time and the\nstrength of the applied field.\n\n6.2.1\n\nZero Field Evolution\n\nIn zero field, equation (6.12) becomes\n\u2212n\u22121\n\nC1,n (N, \u03bb, 0, \u03c4 ) = 8N (N + 1)\n\nsin\n\u001a\n\n2\n\n\u0014\u0012\n\n1\n1+\nN\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03bb\u03c4\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013 \u0015\u001b n\u22121\n2\n1\nN + 1 + 2 cos 2 1 +\n\u03bb\u03c4\n.

For all m and n, Cm,n is an oscillating\nfunction of time, with periodicity T\u03c6 (N, \u03bb, 0) [see equation (5.28)]. The mode of\nthese oscillations is determined by the relative values of N and m + n. Let us define\nthe quantity \u03b6 = m + n. If\n\n(N + 1)2\n\u03b6<\n,\n(6.16)\n2N\nCm,n is sinusoidal, and peaks at time \u03c40 = T\u03c6 /2. Otherwise, the concurrence develops\na double-peaked structure, whose maxima shift further apart as \u03b6 increases [figures\n6.1(a) and 6.1(b)].

The transition between the two regimes can be observed by comparing\nthe form of the purple and orange curves of figure 6.1(a). Interestingly, C p+ is\n\nindependent of N, suggesting that as \u03b6 becomes large, the maximum achievable\nentanglement between any two neutrons depends only on the number of scattering\nevents which have taken place. The peak concurrence at fixed m for N = 10 is\nshown in figure 6.1(d).\n\nIn general, it is not possible to maximize the concurrence of every neutron pair.\nEquations (6.18) and (6.19) describe the results one might obtain if it were possible\nto tune the interaction time \u03c4 of individual neutrons. Of course, this cannot be done;\nas discussed in the previous chapter, \u03c4 is determined by the neutron momentum\nand the size of the sample, and remains constant throughout the realization of the\nprotocol. From figures 6.1(a) and 6.1(b), it is clear that an optimal choice of \u03c4\ndepends on m and n, that is, on the neutron pair we feel most certain of detecting.\nSetting \u03c4 = \u03c40 , for example, will maximize the concurrence of {m, n} pairs {1, 2},\n{1, 3}, {1, 4}, {1, 5}, {2, 3}, and {2, 4}, but is far from ideal for {1, 15}, {6, 10}, etc.\nThis makes us heavily reliant on detecting either the first or the second neutron,\ntogether with a neutron scattered very soon after. On the other hand, going back\n\nto figure 6.1(a), by moving towards the outer edge of the curves the concurrence\nmay not be so high, but Cm,n falls much less sharply with m and n (see figure 6.2).\nGiven the form of \u03b6, a similar result can also be obtained by increasing N.\nWe conclude from figure 6.2 that, provided m and n remain small, the chances of\ndetecting an entangled neutron pair are reasonably fair. This entanglement may be\nlow, but by repeating the protocol a sufficient number of times one could produce\nenough copies of the scattered state to perform distillation. However, this would\nrely on detecting the same neutron pair with every run of the experiment and, as\n\n\f116\n\nChapter 6.

All quantities are expressed in natural units, with \u03bb = 1.\n\n6.2.2\n\nFinite Field Evolution\n\nIn finite field also, the evolution of the concurrence of any neutron pair can be traced\nback to C1,n . Let us then consider the behaviour of C1,n as a function of the applied\nfield and the neutron interaction time, as shown in figure 6.3. A slice through these\ncurves at any point along the Bz axis illustrates the concurrence remains a periodic\nfunction of \u03c4 irrespective of the field (figure 6.4). Bz does, however, determine the\ntimescale of the oscillation, which is given as always by equation (5.28). Comparing\nthe shape of the curves for different values of n, one notes two main features. First,\nthe peak concurrence falls with n. Second, the essential attributes of the curves do\nnot change a great deal as n is increased. In all cases, the concurrence at short\ntimes is characterized by a concave, approximately conical dip, which expands into\na 'valley' as n becomes large. By inspection, maximum values of C1,n lie along the\n'mouth' of this valley, which is mirror-symmetric about Bz = Bz\u2217 . We know this field\nmaximizes the concurrence of the first two neutrons; therefore, from the form of C1,n\nand the trends shown in figure 6.3, we conclude that Bz\u2217 represents the optimal field\nvalue for all m and n. Then, with the help of equation (6.13) and setting Bz = Bz\u2217 ,\nCm,n takes on the particularly simple form\nCm,n = 2 sin\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03bb\u03c4\n\u221a\nN\n\n\u0013\n\nm+n\u22122\n\ncos\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03bb\u03c4\n\u221a\nN\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(6.20)\n\n\f118\n\nChapter 6.

Finally, from (6.20) and (6.21), the maximum concurrence of any neutron\npair is given by\ns\np\n\nC =4\n\n(\u03b6 \u2212 2)\u03b6\u22122\n,\n\u03b6\u03b6\n\n(6.22)\n\nwhich, for ease of comparison, I have written in terms of \u03b6 = m + n. Indeed, a\nquick glance to section 6.2.1 shows equations (6.22) and (6.18) are identical. This\nhighlights an unexpected property of the system: applying a magnetic field can only\nimprove the maximum concurrence of a given neutron pair with respect to its zero\nfield value if the number of scattered neutrons is, roughly speaking, smaller than\nthe number of spins in the sample. Above this, we run up against a fundamental\nlimit, whereby the maximum concurrence is independent of the external parameters.\nTherefore, C p represents an upper bound to the amount of entanglement any two\nneutrons can acquire. It is important to note that equations (6.21) and (6.22) do\nnot in general describe the performance of the protocol in finite field; rather, they\ndefine how the concurrence of a given neutron pair would scale if neutron interaction\ntimes were individually tuneable.\n\n\f119\n\nChapter 6.

If the field is weak, \u03b6B is proportional to\nN. Therefore, the optimal interaction time at fixed N will depend on the number\nof scattered neutrons relative to the number of spins in the sample. If this ratio\n\n\fChapter 6. Many-Neutron Scattering\n\n122\n\nis small, the optimal time is the same (i.e. T\u03c6 /2) for all m and n. Otherwise, as\ndiscussed in section 6.2.1, one must choose a time which yields appreciable values of\nCm,n for the broadest possible interval |m \u2212 n|. As the field is raised above Bz\u2212 , this\n\noptimization strategy becomes compulsory to avoid the concurrence plummeting\nafter the first few scattering events. When Bz exceeds Bz+ , \u03b6B becomes large and\noptimal measurement times come once more to coincide. However, the concurrence\nof any neutron pair is extremely low no matter how values of \u03c4 are chosen. These\nresults are shown in figure 6.5.\n\nIn conclusion, if the sample is prepared in a single-magnon state the performance\nof the protocol can be optimized by applying a magnetic field within the range\n[Bz\u2212 , Bz+ ]. In general the concurrence of an arbitrary neutron pair decreases with\nthe total number of scattering events. However, by choosing the neutron velocity\nwith care, one can ensure this decline is moderately slow. Therefore, the likelihood of\ndetecting an entangled neutron pair is reasonably strong, though it remains desirable\nto detect neutrons scattered in quick succession. Peak values of the concurrence do\nnot typically exceed 0.5 unless one of the neutrons detected is the first. Consequently,\nthe yield of highly entangled pairs could be improved by periodically re-setting the\nsample, i.e re-initializing the system to the original input state.\n\n\f123\n\nChapter 6.

This occurs because\nthe system can now accommodate as many spin flips as scattered neutrons, therefore\nthe size of the working Hilbert space grows linearly in the total number of incoming\nneutrons. Consequently, the concurrence must be characterized using numerical\nmethods. Owing to the increased computational demands as the number of scattered\nneutrons becomes large, I will limit my study to short interaction times bounded\nby \u03c4 = 20 (expressed in natural units, and for \u03bb = 1). As this interval suffices to\nobserve the salient features of the concurrence of the first two neutrons, and the\ninteraction of each neutron with the sample is the same, it is not unreasonable to\nassume that any interesting features of the function Cm,n might emerge within this\ntime frame.\nAt fixed N, we expect the concurrence of a given neutron pair to depend on three\nparameters\n1.

I work with N = 10, for which the peak concurrence of the\nfirst neutron pair falls just below 0.1 (see figure 5.5).\nIt is useful to begin with a brief recap of the properties of C1,2 . These are summarized in two points: (i) oscillatory behaviour as a function of interaction time; (ii)\n\u221a\nmaximum amplitude for \u03b1 = 23 . Let us then observe the concurrence of different\n\u221a\n\nneutron pairs at \u03b1 = 23 ; this is shown in figure 6.6. It is immediately evident that\nthe concurrence maintains its characteristic periodicity irrespective of the indices\nm and n, however these indices do affect the mode of oscillation. At fixed n, the\nconcurrence falls with m and, with the exception of m = 1, the peak value of Cmn\nfalls with increasing |m \u2212 n|. More interesting features develop as \u03b1 \u2192 \u221a12 . It now\n\nemerges that the concurrence of distant (|m \u2212 n| > 2) neutrons can exceed that\nof neutrons scattered in succession (figures 6.7-6.11). The most prominent example\noccurs at m = 1 and \u03b1 = \u221a12 , for which the concurrence of the first and second neutrons represents a minimum value. This may seem promising, however the neutron\nconcurrence remains low no matter which neutron pair we detect. Furthermore,\neven for an optimal choice of input parameters, the resulting state of the scattered\nneutrons is not compatible with the witness decomposition of equation (5.99).\n\n\f126\n\nChapter 6.

Comparing the concurrence of an arbitrary pair {m, n} with C1,2 at\nBz < Bz+ , it is no longer a given that the peak value of Cm,n will increase if\nBz is raised [see section 5.2.2 and figure 6.6(b)]. As expected, the details of the time\nevolution of Cm,n are determined by the strength of the field and the neutron polarization; however, exactly how these parameters affect the concurrence is a priori\nunclear. To make our task more manageable, let us use the strength of the external\nfield to define three regimes:\n1. Weak field: Bz \u2264 \u03bb2 ;\n\n\fChapter 6. Many-Neutron Scattering\n\n132\n\n2. Strong field: Bz \u2265 3\u03bb;\n3. Optimal field: Bz = Bz\u2217 ,\nand study the features of the concurrence in each case for different neutron polarizations.\nIn the weak field regime, the concurrence of the first and second neutrons shows a\nwell-defined periodicity as a function of the interaction time (cfr. figure 5.15). As m\nand n are increased, this is no longer true unless \u03b1 = 0. In general, the concurrence\nfalls with increasing |m\u2212n|, though when m > 2 instances of Cm,n > Cm,m\u00b11 become\n\nmore common.\n\nA strong dependence on the neutron polarization is also observed and, in analogy\nwith the results of section 5.2.2, the performance of the system markedly improves\nas \u03b1 \u2192 0 (figs. 6.12-6.15). Indeed, the \u03b1 = 0 case merits a separate discussion, as\nseveral interesting effects are observed. First, as noted above, the concurrence of\nany neutron pair shows traces of the periodic behaviour observed for C1,2 . Second,\nfor any m and n the concurrence evolves through a series of peaks. At fixed m,\npeaks in Cm,n for different n are aligned [see figure 6.15(a)], though as m increases\nthe position of the strongest peak can change. In correspondence of this peak, the\n1\nconcurrence at fixed m falls as (n + 1)\u2212 2 . The scattered state of the neutrons at\nthis time is always compatible with the witness decomposition of equation (5.99),\nhowever the concurrence of any non-successive neutron pair never exceeds 0.6. This\nis shown in figure 6.15(d).\n\n\f133\n\nChapter 6.

Excluding for the moment the case \u03b1 = 0, for an arbitrary neutron\npolarization Cm,n retains some traces of periodicity provided m \u2264 2. Otherwise, the\n\nconcurrence is a disordered function of the interaction time. As in weak field, peak\nvalues of Cm,n increase as \u03b1 \u2192 0, but fall with |m \u2212 n|. However, is now extremely\ndifficult to find instances of \u03c4 and n for which the concurrence at fixed m increases\nwith respect to Cm,m\u00b11 . As opposed to C1,2 , if m > 1 the concurrence of a given\nneutron pair can improve with respect to its zero-field value, even if Bz exceeds the\nthreshold Bz+ . However, the concept of a limiting field still applies, as it is not\npossible to increase the peak concurrence indefinitely by making the field stronger\n(see figure 6.16).\n\n\f136\n\nChapter 6.

In this case, Cm,n retains the\nsame periodicity as C1,2 for all m and n (see figure 6.17). In analogy to its weakfield behaviour, the concurrence evolves through a series of peaks which, at fixed m,\nare aligned for different n. If \u03c4 is chosen to coincide with a peak, the concurrence\nat fixed m falls with a very gentle gradient as n\u22121 . This gradient does not change\n\n\f137\n\nChapter 6. Many-Neutron Scattering\n\nsignificantly as m is increased, therefore the concurrence of neutron m with any other\nis generally a slowly-varying function of n. In other words, provided |m \u2212 n| remains\nsufficiently small, the concurrence of any neutron pair is roughly constant (see figure\n6.17(d)). Consequently, for a group of neutrons scattered in quick succession, the\nentanglement with respect to any bipartition is also approximately constant, and\ncan be detected using the witness of equation (5.99).\nHaL\n\nHbL\n\n0.10\n\n0.10\nC\n\n0.15\n\nC\n\n0.15\n\n0.05\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n\u03a4\n\n8\n\n10\n\n\u03a4\n\nHcL\n\nHdL\n0.15\n\n0.14\n0.12\n\n0.10\n\n0.08\n\nC\n\nC\n\n0.10\n\n0.06\n0.05\n\n0.04\n0.02\n0.00\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\u03a4\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0.00\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nn\n\nFigure 6.17: The concurrence for Bz = 3\u03bb and \u03b1 = 0.

On the\nbasis of our discussion so far, it is reasonable to assume the protocol will be most\nsuccessful at \u03b1 = 0, therefore I will focus on this limit. It was shown in section\n5.1.2 that the concurrence of the first two scattered neutrons is a maximum when\nthe field is set to Bz\u2217 . At general m and n, this is no longer the case, because the\nconcurrence of neutron n with any neutron scattered before it will depend on the\n\n\fChapter 6. Many-Neutron Scattering\n\n138\n\nsample state it encounters. For the case of C1,2 , Bz\u2217 represents an optimum because it\nallows us to 'deposit' entanglement in the system by creating a maximally entangled\nstate of the first neutron and the sample. For all practical purposes, at this stage of\nthe protocol the sample behaves like a two-level system; it is therefore conceivable\nthat the second scattering event might swap - at least in part - the state of the\nsecond neutron and the state of the system. After all, the entanglement has few\nother places to go. As the sample acquires more spin-flips, several effects come into\nplay. First, the entanglement we deposit acquires new channels over which to redistribute itself. Second, the sample ceases to behave like a qubit, and becomes a\nbona fide multilevel system. At that point, even if neutron n were to encounter a\nfully entangled state of neutron m and the sample, the protocol could only succeed if\nmost of the sample wavefunction were concentrated in the single-excitation subspace.\nAs the number of events grows, the chances of this happening become very slim.\nTherefore, in the context of this more general version of the protocol, Bz\u2217 simply\ndefines an 'intermediate' field regime. As one might expect, the concurrence in this\nregime shows a mixture of strong- and weak-field features. Among the former, we\nnote the existence of interaction times for which the concurrence of any neutron\npair is linearly dependent on |m \u2212 n| [see figure 6.18(b)]. Among the latter, we find\n\ninstances in which the concurrence of a non-consecutive pair is greater than that of\ntwo neutrons scattered in succession [see figure 6.18(c)].\nIn summary, if the sample is prepared in a fully polarized state, the concurrence of\nneutrons m and n falls with the number of scattering events between them. In some\ncases, it is possible to predict how Cm,n scales with |m \u2212 n|, however the evolution\n\nof the concurrence is generally unpredictable, unless either the applied field is zero,\nor the neutrons are polarized in the negative \u1e91-direction. In the former case, the\nconcurrence of any neutron pair is low; in the latter, the performance of the protocol\ndepends on the strength of the applied field. Best results are obtained in the weak1\nfield regime, where the concurrence at fixed m scales roughly as n\u2212 2 . Maximum\nvalues of the concurrence of any non-consecutive pair do not exceed 0.5, hence in\nthis respect a realization with input state |\u03c8 B i is equivalent to a realization with\ninput state |\u03c8 A i. What we lose is the ability to predict with certainty when the\n\nconcurrence of a given pair will peak, although from the behaviour of Cm,n with\n\u03c4 (cfr. figure 6.15) one could formulate a rough guess. Unfortunately, given the\nnon-analytical form of Cm,n in weak field, the margin of error is rather narrow.\n\n\f139\n\nChapter 6.

To assess the true performance of the protocol\nin a realistic situation, any reference to the indices of the scattered neutrons must\nnow be removed. The question to ask becomes: will a pair of neutrons chosen at\nrandom from those which have scattered be entangled?\nThe results of sections 6.2 and 6.3 indicate that the entanglement of two neutrons\n\nm and n decreases with |m \u2212 n|. Let us therefore assume we apply a resetting pulse\nto the sample whenever the number of scattered neutrons approaches N, such that\n\n\fChapter 6. Many-Neutron Scattering\n\n140\n\n|m\u2212n| < N. I introduce the quantities t and C\u0304 to represent the number of scattered\nneutrons on which measurements are performed, and the concurrence of the average\nstate of any pair, respectively. For ease of comparison, I will compute the average\nconcurrence relative to the situations presented in figures 6.2(a), 6.2(b), 6.5(b),\n6.5(d), 6.5(e), 6.15, 6.17, and 6.18. These all correspond to optimal realizations of\nthe protocol at fixed N and Bz , either with input state |\u03c80A i (first five cases) or with\n\ninput state |\u03c80B i (latter three cases). As expected, the average concurrence falls\nwith the size of the sampling ensemble. However, some slightly surprising features\nare observed, according to the choice of input state and the strength of the applied\nfield.\nIf the sample is prepared in a single-magnon state (input state |\u03c80A i), the likelihood\n\nof detecting an entangled pair is strongly dependent on the value of Bz . If Bz\nis zero, C\u0304 is a slowly-varying function of t - in fact, at certain values of \u03c4 the\nC\u0304 vs. t curve shows an almost linear trend (see figure 6.19). Consequently, the\naverage concurrence remains finite for an appreciable range of t, and shows signs\nof converging to a lower limit as t \u2192 N. As the field is increased, the relationship\n\nbetween C\u0304 and t changes rather dramatically, approaching a near-exponential decay\nin the intermediate field regime [figure 6.20(b)]. By the time Bz reaches Bz+ the\n\ncurve has somewhat flattened out, but values of C\u0304 are extremely low, and fall to\nzero by t = 5. Best results are therefore achieved at zero or small fields.\nConversely, if the sample is prepared in a fully polarized state, it makes little sense\nto consider an average concurrence unless a field is applied. This is due to the\nfact that, in zero field, the concurrence is extremely low for all m and n. The\noptimal operating mode for the system now seems to be the weak field regime, in\n1\nwhich, for an optimal choice of \u03c4 , the average concurrence falls as t\u2212 2 . As above,\nthe situation deteriorates as the field is raised, and in the intermediate and strong\nfield limits the behaviour of the system is similar to that observed for input state\n|\u03c80A i. We conclude that, for either input state, the probability of a measurement\n\non two randomly chosen chosen neutrons yielding an entangled state is substantial,\nsubject to a set of experimental conditions. First, the neutron interaction time must\nbe chosen appropriately. Second, the field must remain below the threshold Bz\u2212 .\nThird, if input state |\u03c80B i is chosen, the neutron spin must be antiparallel to the\nquantization axis.\n\n\f141\n\nChapter 6.

Extending this protocol to include the -more\nrealistic- possibility of multiple scattering events, it emerges that any two neutrons\nscattered within a certain time frame of each other can be measurably entangled\nin a similar fashion. The absolute value of this entanglement is generally low, and\nfalls well short of the threshold CE = 0.67 defined in section 5.5. However, the\nscheme remains of great interest from a fundamental viewpoint, providing as it does\na simple, practical means to answer the as-yet unresolved question: can two distinct\n\n\fChapter 6. Many-Neutron Scattering\n\n143\n\nneutrons be entangled?\nIn general, the outcome of the protocol is determined by the number of scattered\nneutrons relative to the number of scatterers. Provided this ratio remains small,\nthere is a strong possibility that measurements made on any two scattered neutrons\nwill yield an entangled state. Optimal performance can therefore be achieved by\nperiodically resetting the sample to its initial state. In these circumstances, the\naverage concurrence of any neutron pair is of order 0.2, corresponding to just under\n0.1 ebits of entanglement. This can be boosted either by specifying which neutron\npair to measure, or by increasing the frequency of the resetting pulses. Distillation\nmay also be a possibility, but only if one could ensure detection of the same neutron\npair subsequent to each re-initialization of the sample state.\nA more detailed analysis of the distribution of entanglement within the scattered\nneutron bunch further shows the concurrence is finite with respect to several bipartitions. Provided the number of scattered neutrons is small, one therefore creates\ngenuine multi-partite entanglement. However, this particular aspect of the protocol\nhas not been explored in great detail.\nThe experimental requirements of the scheme were assessed in section 5.5, where\nit was concluded that measurement of the witness of equation (5.99) may be extremely challenging, but not a priori impossible. This is reinforced by the results of\nthe present chapter. Therefore, the only outstanding problems remain the neutron\nvelocity and the neutron coherence length. The former issue was discussed in detail\nin the previous chapter. As regards the neutron coherence volume, we recall this\nquantity depends on the degree to which a beam can be monochromated. A perfect\ncrystal monochromator can achieve velocity resolutions of \u2206v/v = 10\u22125 [125], but\nfor our purposes this is not enough. Higher resolutions may be achievable by selecting neutrons from the beam with the aid of an extremely high frequency chopper.\nThis has not been reported to date, but should not be impossible, as there exists no\nfundamental lower limit to \u2206v/v. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that meeting\nthe final requirement of the protocol may simply be a matter of time.\n\n\fChapter 7\nThe Problem of Scalability and\nthe Need for Communication\nIn this chapter, I introduce the topic of quantum state transfer with spin chains. The\nuse of a spin chain as a communication channel was first suggested by Bose [126], in\na bid to find an efficient means of transferring quantum states over short distances in\nsolid-state devices. It was found that unmodulated spin chains are natural conduits\nof quantum information, but do not always allow high quality communication. Many\nimprovements to the basic communication protocol have since been suggested, and\nthese will be summarized. I will then explain the original communication scheme\nin detail, and review its performance. Possible experimental implementations will\nalso be discussed, ending with a general overview of spin chain communication as a\nquantum computational technique.\n\n7.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAt the very beginning of this thesis, it was observed that communication represents\nthe sharing of a correlation. In practice, this correlation arises when information\nflows from one party to another via some kind of mediating channel. There exist\na wide variety of channels capable of transmitting classical information, but those\nsame channels are not in general adequate for quantum state distribution. Indeed, it\n\n144\n\n\fChapter 7. The Problem of Scalability and the Need for Communication\n\n145\n\nhas been shown that transferring quantum information through a classical channel\ninvolves a loss of at least a third of the original information [127]. This is unacceptable for protocols such as teleportation or quantum key distribution, which\nrequire faithful exchange of qubits. Currently, the most common means of transferring quantum information is the optical fibre, a choice born of necessity as most\nlarge-scale quantum computational tasks attempted to date have employed photons\nas qubits. This is down to the photon's low interaction cross-section, which enable\nit to remain in a coherent state over large distances both in air and in optical fibres.\nHowever, in recent years the problem of quantum state transfer in solid-state devices\nhas attracted a great deal of attention; in fact, it has been suggested this may be\nthe key to building quantum computers large enough to rival existing processors.\nJust as the computing power of a classical machine is directly related to the number\nof transistors on its Central Processing Unit (CPU), the computing power of a\nquantum computer is directly proportional to the number of qubits it can access. It\nhas been calculated that a 106 -qubit quantum computer running with a clock speed\nof 100 MHz could, in just one hour, solve a factorization problem that would keep\nthe most powerful existing supercomputer busy for a time comparable to the age of\nthe universe. Unfortunately, this is at least a million times larger than the machines\ncurrently within our ability to build [128, 129].\nScalability is therefore a key requirement for a feasible quantum computer architecture. Up-scaling current designs is not a straightforward task, for two main reasons.\nFirst, many-qubit systems acquire extra degrees of freedom, which are difficult to\ncontrol and provide a path for spurious interactions with the environment. As a\nresult, the system becomes more vulnerable to decoherence and, consequently, a\nless reliable quantum computer. A second problem relates to the implementation of\ntwo-qubit gates between distant qubits. To achieve this, the qubits must interact\neither directly or by a common bus mode, but neither approach is without its problems. If we aim for direct couplings, the qubits in question (or, alternatively, the\ninformation they encode) must be shuttled around the system until they are close\nenough to interact, and then returned to their original positions. This is clearly\ninefficient, and would slow the calculation down considerably. On the other hand,\nif one employs a common bus mode there is a physical limitation to the number\nof qubits that can be coupled. These issues become increasingly problematic as\nthe size of the computer increases, thus rendering the construction of a many-qubit\n\n\fChapter 7. The Problem of Scalability and the Need for Communication\n\n146\n\n'processor unit' an extremely challenging task.\n\n7.2\n\nA Review of Quantum Communication with\nSpin Chains\n\nHow else could quantum processors be scaled up, if not by simply adding extra\nqubits? The past few years have witnessed the advent of a 'divide and conquer'\nphilosophy. This entails building a modular processor composed of several interconnected few-qubit registers, which could either act as parallel processors, or perhaps\nhave different functions (one register could be the CPU, another the memory etc.).\nSuch a 'collaborative' approach clearly requires fast, efficient communication between the registers. The best known and most widely used carriers of quantum\ninformation are photons, because they travel naturally and are easily isolated from\ntheir environment. Photons can be successfully propagated over distances of hundreds of kilometers through optical fibres, free space - even through outer space,\nas recently demonstrated by a team of researchers led by Zeilinger [130, 131, 132].\nOne might then suggest constructing a simple quantum computer by connecting a\nseries of solid-state processors by a mesh of optical fibres, but until very recently this\napproach seemed impractical, owing to the difficulty of interfacing photonic qubits\nwith solid-state devices. It has now been shown that strong coupling can be achieved\nin a variety of systems [133, 134], which may open up the possibility of exploring\nthis avenue. The option of a quantum computer with 'all optical' components has\nbeen looked into, but such designs are complex and often involve non-linear processes, which are very challenging to implement experimentally (see [135, 136, 137]\nand references therein).\nRecently, much effort has been dedicated to studying systems in which quantum\ninformation is encoded in stationary qubits and propagated from one part of the\nsystem to another by the natural interaction between the system's components. One\nof the simplest geometries in which this can be achieved is a one-dimensional chain\nof interacting particles, where the qubit is encoded in the particles' spin degree of\nfreedom. This is usually referred to as a spin chain. The original proposal for\nquantum communication through spin chains was put forward by Bose [126], who\n\n\fChapter 7. The Problem of Scalability and the Need for Communication\n\n147\n\nstudied a ferromagnetic, exchange-coupled chain of spins with a constant nearestneighbour interaction, in an external magnetic field. It was found that information\ncould be transferred with a fidelity exceeding the maximum classical value in a time\nthat grows polynomially with the length of the chain. The importance of this result\nlies in the fact that the transfer protocol requires no external control whatsoever.\nAll the experimentalist must do is encode a quantum state into the first spin of the\nchain, wait for a well-defined amount of time and measure the last spin of the chain.\nDepending on the chain length, the fortunate experimentalist will have recovered\na more or less perfect copy of the initial state without having to intervene in the\ntransfer process in any way.\nIt was subsequently shown that slightly more complex systems allowed better performance. Osborne and Linden [138] demonstrated the viability of transmission\nfidelities close to unity if the qubit is taken to be a carefully designed 'wave packet',\nprovided the sending and receiving parties can access a sufficiently large portion\nof the chain. In the absence of structural imperfections, an XY Hamiltonian on a\nhyper-cubic lattice allows perfect state transfer [139, 140, 141], as do parallel spin\nchains [142]. Arbitrarily perfect state transfer can also be achieved by applying a\nsequence of two-qubit gates at the receiving end of a quantum chain [143], or by employing auxiliary local memories [144]. Plenio et al. [145] have studied the situation\nfor chains of harmonic oscillators (i.e. where each particle on the lattice possesses a\ncontinuous, rather than a discrete, degree of freedom), while Hartmann et al. [146]\nhave recently found that quantum information can be made to propagate with arbitrarily high fidelity through both oscillator and spin chains near a quantum phase\ntransition. This transfer is exponentially slow; more rapid transmission is possible\nat the quantum critical point, but at some cost to the fidelity. High fidelities can\nalso be attained by engineering the strength and the nature of the interactions between the spins [147, 148], or by performing well-defined projective measurements on\nparts of the chain [149, 150]. Perfect state transfer is even achievable in disordered\nor imperfect systems, and without state initialization, although extra resources or\nerror correction may be required [149, 151, 152].\nThe vast majority of these protocols assume only short-range couplings between\nthe spins in the system. More recently, Kay [153] has made a detailed study of\nfinite spin chains in which the total Hamiltonian accounts for a long-range magnetic\ndipole potential. It was found that state transfer can be optimized by fine-tuning\n\n\fChapter 7. The Problem of Scalability and the Need for Communication\n\n148\n\nthe inter-particle spacings and applying local magnetic fields at each spin site.\nSome effort has also been dedicated to examining the effect of thermal fluctuations\non the transfer process [154]. For short chains, there exist analytical expressions\nwhich demonstrate that thermal fluctuations affect the fidelity of the transfer, but\nnot its speed. For longer chains, the problem rapidly becomes intractable because\nthe dimensions of the Hilbert space of the system blow up exponentially as the\nnumber of qubits increases. In most state transfer protocols suggested to date, this\ndifficulty is avoided by choosing Hamiltonians with built-in symmetries, which allow\none to work in a Hilbert space that grows linearly rather than exponentially in the\nnumber of spins (see section 7.3.1). These symmetries cannot be exploited if dissipative processes such as thermally induced excitations are present, therefore thermal\neffects are often neglected. This is not necessarily an unrealistic approximation, as\nit equates to considering thermal energy scales kT which are negligible compared\nto the strength of, say, an external magnetic field or the inter-qubit couplings. One\ncould certainly engineer such a situation in a laboratory environment.\n\n7.3\n\nThe Communication Protocol\n\nWe now review the communication protocol originally suggested by Bose [126]. The\npresent discussion deals with a linear chain geometry, however the scheme is valid\nfor an arbitrary graph of qubits.\nA sending party, who in the name of tradition we call Alice, wishes to transmit\nan unknown quantum state to a receiving party, surprisingly named Bob, who is\nlocated at the opposite end of the chain. The transfer can be achieved with minimal\neffort following four very simple steps:\n1. The chain is initialized to its ground state.\n2. Alice prepares a qubit in the state she wishes to transmit and replaces the first\nspin in the chain with this qubit.\n3. The chain is left to evolve for a finite amount of time under the effect of its\ninternal Hamiltonian.\n\n\fChapter 7. The Problem of Scalability and the Need for Communication\n\n149\n\n4. Bob measures the last spin in the chain and recovers a copy of the state\noriginally prepared by Alice.\nThe key stage of this protocol is point 3: the information encoded by Alice is\ntransferred to Bob spontaneously by the inter-spin couplings. As we will see in the\nfollowing sections, information has flowed from Alice's end of the chain to Bob's.\nThe chain therefore acts as a channel for quantum information, albeit not a perfect\none, as the state recovered by Bob is rarely an exact copy of that sent by Alice. This\noutcome is easily understood if one imagines Alice's quantum state as a wavepacket\nof finite width, initially centred on the first spin of the chain. The wavepacket spreads\nas it travels, hence the information it contains is no longer localized but dispersed\nover several spins. To some extent, this effect is related to the length of the chain:\nshorter chains often perform better as the initial wavepacket has less \"room\" to\nspread out. As a result of dispersion, when Bob measures the end spin he will only\nrecover part of the original wavepacket, consequently receiving an incomplete sample\nof the information Alice sent.\nTo optimize the quality of the information he receives, Bob must measure his spin\nat the optimal moment. One might expect this to be the time at which the peak\nof the initial wavepacket reaches Bob's end of the chain; however, this is not always\nthe case. Indeed, it is often advantageous to wait a little longer, thus allowing the\nwavepacket to propagate back and forth through the chain several times. As it is\nreflected from the ends, it interferes with itself and may experience a partial revival\nat the site of Bob's spin. If Bob is quick, he can measure at this time, but the\noccurrence of such revivals is unfortunately somewhat difficult to predict.\nThe realization of the protocol rests on three assumptions. First, it must be possible\nto initialize the chain to a known state, which in this case corresponds to the ground\nstate. In a ferromagnetic chain, this is simply achieved by applying a strong magnetic\nfield to polarize the spins, and is therefore not a great challenge. Second, Alice\nand Bob must be able to perform measurements on their spins in order to encode\nand extract the information. This is considerably trickier, owing to the difficulty\nof performing spin-selective measurements on the distance scales involved, though\npossible test systems have been suggested [126]. Finally, these measurements must\ntake place on a timescale shorter than the spin-lattice relaxation time T1 , as both\nthe encoding and the decoding operations rely on the chain being in a specific state.\n\n\fChapter 7. The Problem of Scalability and the Need for Communication\n\n7.3.1\n\n150\n\nThe Hamiltonian\n\nThe great strength of the protocol we have just described lies in the fact that Alice\nand Bob do not need to intervene in the transfer process in any way: the state is\ntransferred spontaneously by the interaction between the spins in the chain. In this\nrespect, the transfer process can be thought of as the solid-state analogue of photon\ntransmission through a vacuum. The protocol therefore exploits a natural property\nof the system, as opposed to the vast gamut of quantum computational tasks which\nrequire the experimentalist to keep a tight rein on any degrees of freedom their\nsystem may exhibit. One feels almost as if the much-fabled - and so far elusive free lunch were within close reach.\nThe characteristics of the transfer process are governed by the Hamiltonian of the\nspin chain. Bose's original proposal sees the spins coupled by a ferromagnetic\nnearest-neighbour exchange interaction and immersed in an external magnetic field,\nsuch that the overall Hamiltonian of the system reads\nH0 = \u2212\n\nX\nhiji\n\ni\n\nj\n\nJij \u03c3 * \u03c3 \u2212\n\nN\nX\n\nBj \u03c3zj ,\n\n(7.1)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere the first sum runs over all nearest-neighbouring pairs hiji and the second over\nall N spins in the chain. Both Jij and Bj are chosen to be positive numbers, hence\nthe ground state of this Hamiltonian is fully polarized in the positive \u1e91 direction.\nExcitations from this ground state are represented by de-localized spin-flips, often\ndescribed in terms of spin waves [105].\nThe choice of Hamiltonian is determined by two main factors. First, it is physically\nrealistic, as it accurately describes the energy level structure of many ferromagnets\n[155]. Second, it conserves the number of excitations in the system; indeed, if the\ntotal magnetization is proportional to the number of spin flips, one finds\n[H0 , Sz ] = 0,\n\n(7.2)\n\n\f151\n\nChapter 7. The Problem of Scalability and the Need for Communication\n\nwhere Sz is the sum of the individual spin components in the \u1e91-direction\nSz =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03c3zj .\n\n(7.3)\n\nj=1\n\nAs a result of (7.2), the dimensions of the Hilbert space needed to to describe the\n\u0001\nsystem is drastically reduced, as dimH = N\n, where m is the number of excitations.\nm\nIn the simplest case of m = 1, the dimensions of H grow linearly with the length of\n\nthe chain. It is therefore possible to solve even very large systems analytically, an\nimpossible task if one were obliged to work with the full Hilbert space.\n\n7.3.2\n\nNotation\n\nBefore proceeding with a more quantitative description of the communication protocol, a comment on notation is required. In keeping with the Bloch sphere representation of eigenkets of the Pauli spin operators, it has so far been assumed that\nstates |0i and |1i represent the spin up and down eigenstates of \u03c3z , respectively.\nThe convention adopted in [126] reverses this labeling. Therefore, to avoid possible\nconfusion, I will henceforth label the eigenstates of \u03c3z explicitly as | \u2191i and | \u2193i.\nThe ground state of the chain can then be represented as | \u21931 \u21932 \u21933 ... \u2193N i, where the\nsubscripts refer to the positions of the spins; I abbreviate this state as | \u21d3i. The ket\n|ji will indicate a state with a spin flip on site j, the ket |jki a state with spin flips\nat sites j and k, and so on. It will be assumed Alice encodes her information in the\n\nspin at position s (standing for sender), and Bob chooses to measure the spin at\nposition r (standing for receiver). In all but very few cases it will be assumed that\ns = 1 and r = N.\n\n7.3.3\n\nThe Fidelity as a Measure of Success\n\nWith these tools in place, the steps of the protocol can be reiterated as follows:\n1. The chain is initialized by applying a magnetic field and waiting until the\nground state | \u21d3i is attained.\n\n\fChapter 7. The Problem of Scalability and the Need for Communication\n\n152\n\n2. Alice removes the first spin of the chain and replaces it with her encoded qubit\n|ai = \u03b1| \u2193i + \u03b2| \u2191i to create the state |\u03c8i i\n|\u03c8i i = |ai1 | \u21932 ... \u2193N i = \u03b1| \u21d3i + \u03b2|1i.\n3. The chain is left to evolve for time t to output state |\u03c8f i under the effect of\n(7.1):\n|\u03c8f i = \u03b1| \u21d3i + \u03b2e\u2212iH0 t |1i = \u03b1| \u21d3i + \u03b2\n\nPN\n\n\u2212iH0 t\n|1i|ji.\nj=1 hj|e\n\n4. Bob measures the spin at his end of the chain and obtains the state |b(t)i:\n|b(t)i = \u221a 1\n\nP (t)\n\n[\u03b1| \u2193i + \u03b2f (t)| \u2191i],\n\nwith\nf (t) = hN|e\u2212iH0 t |1i\nP (t) = |\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2|f (t)|2 .\nThe function f (t) is a propagator, and represents the transition amplitude from\nstate |1i to state |Ni. If the protocol is successful, at some time t0 Bob will find\nf (t0 ) = 1, hence |b(t0 )i = |ai. The value of the propagator is therefore related to\n\nthe quality of the transfer, and can be employed to measure of the success of the\nprotocol via a quantity known as the fidelity\n\u00132\n\u0012 q\n1\n1\n\u2032\nF (\u03c1, \u03c1 ) \u2261 T r \u03c1 2 \u03c1 \u03c1 2 ,\n\u2032\n\n(7.4)\n\nwhere \u03c1 and \u03c1\u2032 are the initial and final density operators. The fidelity evaluates how\nfaithfully a quantum channel maps an input state \u03c1 to an output state \u03c1\u2032 . It is a\nreal-valued function spanning the interval [0, 1], which is non-zero provided there\nis some overlap between the input and output states, and unity if \u03c1 = \u03c1\u2032 . The\ndefinition (7.4) applies to both pure and mixed states, but when dealing with pure\nstates it is more convenient to introduce a second quantity, known as the averaged\nfidelity\n|f (t)| |f (t)|2 1\n+\n+ ,\n(7.5)\nF\u0304 =\n3\n6\n2\n\n\fChapter 7. The Problem of Scalability and the Need for Communication\n\n153\n\nwhere the average is calculated over all pure input states of the Bloch sphere. There\nare several other measures of the performance of a quantum channel, but these are\nmore complex and will not be described here. As the present discussion is limited to\npure states, the term 'fidelity' should hereafter be understood as referring to (7.5);\ndefinition (7.4) is not used anywhere in this work.\nIf nearest neighbour couplings are constant and the applied field is uniform, it is\npossible to derive simple expressions both for the spectrum of (7.1) and for the\n\u0001\nfidelity. Setting Jij \u2261 J2 \u03b4i+1,j and Bj \u2261 B, we quote the result obtained by Bose\n\nin [126]\n\nEm\n\nN\nX\n\ni\nh \u03c0\n(m \u2212 1)(2j \u2212 1) |ji\n2N\nj=1\n\u001a\ni\u001b\nh\u03c0\n(m \u2212 1) ,\n= 2B + 2J 1 \u2212 cos\nN\n\n|mi = am\n\nwhere m = 1...N, a1 =\n\n\u221a1 ,\nN\n\ncos\n\nam6=1 =\n\nq\n\n2\n,\nN\n\n(7.6)\n(7.7)\n\nand the ground state energy E0 =\n\n\u2212 J(N \u22121)2 + 2BN is set to zero. The propagator between sites 1 and N of the chain can\nthen be expressed as\nN\nX\nf (t) =\nhN|mihm|1ie\u2212iEm t .\n(7.8)\nm=1\n\nTo calculate the fidelity, this is numerically evaluated and substituted into equation\n(7.5).\n\n7.3.4\n\nThe Performance of the Protocol\n\nFor arbitrary chain length (with the exception of N = 2), the evolution of the fidelity\nas a function of time is disordered and largely unpredictable (fig. 7.1). For N < 30,\nwith few exceptions, time-optimized fidelities exceed 0.8, but the channel becomes\nprogressively worse as the length of the chain increases. Nevertheless, the optimal\nfidelity at N = 80 is still greater than that achievable with a classical channel\n[126, 127]. The presence of several high 'spikes' in the fidelity is encouraging, as it\nsuggests there are several times at which Bob could measure his spin and obtain a\nreasonably good copy of Alice's input state. However, it also implies Bob has a very\n\n\fChapter 7. The Problem of Scalability and the Need for Communication\n\n154\n\nshort window of opportunity in which to make his measurement. For the example\nshown in figure 7.1, for instance, if Bob measures his spin at time t1 he will find\nstate |ai with over 75% fidelity; if, on the other hand, he measures at the not too\ndistant time t2 he will obtain a much poorer result.\n\nOne might expect the optimal measurement time to coincide with the time t0 taken\nby the wavepacket to reach the end of the chain. Roughly speaking, this can be\napproximated as the timescale of a single nearest-neighbour coupling multiplied by\nthe length of the chain. From the uncertainty principle\nt0 \u2248\n\nN \u22121\n,\n2J\n\n(7.9)\n\nwhere 1/2J is the timescale of a single coupling, N \u2212 1 is the length of a chain of N\nspins with unit spacing, and h is set to 1.\nThe same result is obtained from equations (7.6) and (7.7), recalling that a localized\nspin-flip can be written as a superposition of spin waves with different momenta\n|ji =\n\nN\nX\n\nm=1\n\nam cos km |km i,\n\n(7.10)\n\nwhere I have replaced the argument of the cosine with km to make explicit the\nmomentum dependence of the j-states. Given the dispersion relation of equation\n(7.7), the group velocity of the individual spin waves\nvg =\n\nd\u03c9\n= 2J sin km ,\ndkm\n\n(7.11)\n\nis itself a function of momentum. It then becomes clear that wavepacket of equation\n(7.10) spreads because each component of the superposition propagates at a different\nvelocity. As observed in [138], spreading the spin flip over several sites counters the\neffect by reducing the number of momenta involved in the summation. The fastestpropagating component of (7.10) will reach the end of a chain of length L in time\nt0 =\nwhich is the result of equation (7.9).\n\nN \u22121\nL\n\u2261\n,\n2J\n2J\n\n(7.12)\n\n\fChapter 7.

In this example we have set\nJ = 21 and B = 0.\n\nThere have been many interesting studies regarding the relationship between the\noptimal fidelity and the length of the chain. It was already noted in [126] that the\nfidelity seemed lower for chains whose length was divisible by 3. Subsequently, it\nwas shown that chains of length N > 4 cannot achieve unit fidelity [140], and also\nthat if N is a prime number the fidelity approaches unity in exponential time [156].\nThis may sound enticing, but ultimately one cannot afford to wait so long to achieve\nperfect state transfer. We will return to this point in section 7.6.\n\n7.4\n\nDecoherence\n\nThe discussion so far has been centred on the performance of an isolated spin chain.\nHowever, to obtain a realistic description of the performance of the protocol in a\nrealistic physical setting, interactions of the spin chain with the environment should\nbe considered. With few exceptions [157, 158, 159], the vast majority of existing\nspin chain protocols neglect the problem of decoherence, and the work presented\nin this thesis is no exception. However, recent studies regarding the influence of\ndissipation and decoherence on the transfer process [160, 161] allow us to estimate\n\n\fChapter 7. The Problem of Scalability and the Need for Communication\n\n156\n\nhow several of the protocols described above may perform in less idealized settings.\nThe decoherence mechanisms most relevant to quantum information processing are\ndephasing and damping [49]. Dephasing takes place when interaction with the environment destroys the phase relationships between the components of a quantum\nstate. It is a conservative interaction, because no energy is exchanged between the\nsystem and the environment, and the timescale on which it occurs is usually referred\nto as T2 . Damping, on the other hand, affects the populations of the eigenstates\nof the local Hamiltonian. Typical examples might be the relaxation to the ground\nstate of a sample prepared in some high-energy configuration, or the appearance of\nthermal spin excitations in a perfectly ordered ferromagnetic state when the temperature is raised above zero. Damping is therefore a dissipative process, because\nenergy is exchanged with the environment. The timescale associated with damping\nis usually referred to as T1 .\nA detailed study of the effect of T1 and T2 processes on spin chain communication\nhas recently been carried out in [160]. Here, the authors assume two possible modes\nof interaction of the spin chain with its environment. The 'global' mode involves\neach spin in the chain coupling to a single, 'block' environment, whereas in the 'local'\nmode each spin interacts with a local independent environment. In both cases, effects\non the fidelity of state transfer are strongly dependent on the internal Hamiltonian\nof the spin chain. For a Heisenberg Hamiltonian, the fidelity in the presence of global\nnoise is determined by the transfer time and the so called-environment parameter \u03bd,\nwhich quantifies the relative strength of spin-spin and spin-environment coupling.\nFor a chain of given length, the quality of the transfer becomes steadily worse as \u03bd\nincreases. For a given \u03bd, the quality of the transfer is inversely proportional to the\nlength of the chain, because the longer the chain, the longer it takes for the state\nto be transferred, hence the longer the coupling time to the environment. Similar\nresults are found for the local environment model.\nInterestingly, the situation changes if one considers the mirror-periodic Hamiltonian\nof [139]. In this model, in the absence of decoherence, the time at which perfect\nstate transfer is achieved is constant. For a global dephasing or local damping\nenvironment, this yields an average state transfer fidelity which is independent of\nchain length, but decays with increasing environment parameter. On the other hand,\nin a local dephasing environment, the transfer fidelity falls both with increasing \u03bd\n\n\fChapter 7. The Problem of Scalability and the Need for Communication\n\n157\n\nand with increasing chain length.\nThe effect of a pure local damping environment is analogous to that of a spin bath\nat zero temperature [49, 162]. Recent work has been dedicated to studying the\neffects of thermal fluctuations in more detail. For short spin chains, the problem\nhas been solved analytically [154]. It emerges that finite temperature effects can\ninfluence the fidelity of state transfer, but not the timescale. Recently, more detailed\nresults have been obtained for longer chains globally coupled to a heat bath via\ndissipative exchange interactions [161]. The authors consider state transfer of a\nspinless fermion in a tightly bound lattice, which is analogous to an XY spin model.\nAt zero temperature, the fidelity of state transfer is found to decay exponentially\nwith time. At fixed temperature, the same exponential decrease is observed; at fixed\ntime, however, the performance of the system shows an interesting dependence on\nthe coefficients of the state one sends. Specifically, for a state \u03b1|0i+\u03b2|1i, the transfer\nfidelity decreases with temperature if |\u03b1| > |\u03b2|, but increases with temperature if\n|\u03b1| < |\u03b2|. However, this trend is not particularly strong, and becomes negligible at\nlarge times.\nThe above discussion allows us to conclude that, in all realistic systems, decoherence can seriously impair the efficiency of state transfer. The effect is especially\npronounced when the transfer time is long, which is increasingly the case as the\nlength of the chain grows. Strategies to combat decoherence might then include\nmore robust state-encoding mechanisms or faster transfer times. The latter objective could perhaps be achieved by engineering nearest-neighbour couplings. In some\nsystems, this might only be possible on a global scale; in others, however, locally\ntunable interactions may be a realistic possibility (see Section 7.5).\n\n7.5\n\nExperimental Quantum Communication with\nSpin Chains\n\nIn the years immediately following Bose's proposal, research in quantum communication with spin chains was largely biased towards the theoretical. Practical achievements are now emerging, as progress in instrumentation begins to offer increased\nfreedom in the systems we use as qubits. The majority of proposals for experimental\n\n\fChapter 7. The Problem of Scalability and the Need for Communication\n\n158\n\nimplementation of existing communication schemes are centred on superconducting\nqubits. It has been shown that both charge and flux qubits allow high-fidelity quantum state transfer, even in the presence of manufacturing defects and decoherence\n[163, 164], though no experimental evidence has yet been presented. Quantum state\nmirror-inversion in a chain of three spins has recently been demonstrated in the field\nof NMR, which is well-suited to proof-of-principle trials, but fails for large systems,\nowing to the limitations of the state-preparation procedure [165]. Promising candidates are also 'carbon peapods', single-walled carbon nanotubes containing spin\nqubits trapped in fullerene cages [166]. The properties of the peapod are strongly\ndependent on the nature of the trapped spin. Sc@C60 peapods, for example, can\nbe accurately modeled as Heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin chains with tunable\nnearest-neighbour couplings, as the spin qubit resides mainly on the surface of the\nfullerene cage [167]. Conversely, in systems such as N@C6 0, the spin is well-screened.\nTherefore, exchange couplings are more limited, but other mechanisms, such as dipolar couplings can come into play. In any case, the spin qubit is largely unaffected by\nthe presence of the nanotube, which only serves as structural support, and a buffer\nagainst environment-induced decoherence. Atoms in coupled optical cavities have\nalso been considered; recent results show these can simulate anisotropic XXZ or\nisotropic XXX chains of spin qubits with s \u2265 21 [168]. Given an optimal cavity, all\nnecessary qubit control is provided by laser fields; however, obstacles to practical implementation include decoherence effects and the requirement of strong atom-cavity\ncoupling. Heisenberg and Ising Hamiltonians, as well as more exotic couplings, can\nalso be realized in optical lattices [169]. The idea here is that atoms can be made\nto interact controllably by adjusting the trapping potential. Several possible implementations have been suggested, however these are also not without their difficulties\n[170]. Finally, several proposals centred on quantum dot architectures have been advanced. These hold much promise, as it is now possible to grow regular two- and\nthree- dimensional quantum dot arrays of controllable size and density, potentially\nallowing single-qubit addressability [171]. Interactions between dots are provided\nby the F\u00f6rster effect, through which an excited donor dot transfers an exciton to an\nun-excited acceptor via an electric dipole coupling [172]. Previous work identified\nthe main difficulties with the quantum dot approach in short decoherence times and\nmanufacturing defects [173]; however, recent findings suggest these difficulties can\nbe largely overcome [174], and with some luck, practical tests will soon bear out this\nresult.\n\n\fChapter 7. The Problem of Scalability and the Need for Communication\n\n7.6\n\n159\n\nConclusions\n\nQuantum communication with spin chains is currently one of the most active areas of research in quantum information processing. It has been widely shown that\nan isolated spin chain can afford versatile, high quality distribution of arbitrary\nquantum states with minimal control requirements, though optimal performance\nsometimes requires less flexibility over the operating conditions. A general survey of\nthe communication protocols suggested to date indicates that perfect state transfer\nis achievable in a variety of different ways, provided one can engineer the geometry\nand the energetics of the system, and has access to ancillary registers. It is generally observed that spin chains allow more robust state transfer than sequences of\nSW AP operations, because the use of a permanently-coupled system minimizes the\npossibility of accumulating errors. The issue of state-transfer time has also been\nraised, because an optimal protocol must allow for both quality and speed. Transfer\ntimes do not always bear an obvious relationship to the size of the system, though\nin several cases a rising trend is observed. In absolute terms, the transfer time is\ndetermined by the inter-spin couplings, which in a typical ferromagnet may be of\norder 10 meV. We will see in the following chapter that for the original communication protocol of [126] carried out with a chain of 20 spins, this might yield an\noptimal measurement time of order 10\u221215 s [this is shown in the following chapter,\nin figure 8.6(a)]. Compared to the timescale of a single SW AP gate, which hovers\nabout the pico-second mark in a double quantum dot structure [174, 175], this figure is clearly advantageous; however, other protocols may not perform as efficiently.\nPractical demonstrations of spin chain communication are few, but recent advancements in experimental methods and instrumentation suggest the situation is poised\nto change.\n\n\fChapter 8\nQuantum State Transfer with\nLong-Range Interactions\nThis chapter examines the quality and efficiency of quantum state transfer through\nclosed- and open-ended chains of spin- 12 fermions coupled by long-range magnetic\ndipole interactions. The two geometries are treated separately because they are not\nphysically equivalent; indeed, an open chain has end points, but a closed chain does\nnot. The structural difference is reflected in the dynamics, which show interesting\nand perhaps slightly counter-intuitive features. We will see that the fidelity of state\ntransfer in a chain has a clear periodicity and a predictable evolution in time, but\nthe same cannot be said for a ring. This might seem unusual, given that a ring is a\nperiodic structure and a chain is not; however, analysis of the respective eigenspectra\nreveals the origin of this behaviour. After considering a basic communication scheme\nanalogous to that described in [126], I will explore possible optimization strategies,\nconcluding with some remarks on the robustness of the protocol in the face of experimental uncertainties, fabrication defects and possible decoherence channels.\n\n8.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe majority of spin-chain communication protocols are designed for systems exhibiting only nearest-neighbour interactions. However, in recent years new effort has\n\n160\n\n\fChapter 8. Quantum State Transfer with Long-Range Interactions\n\n161\n\nbeen dedicated to studying systems with anisotropic, long-range couplings. The possibility of implementing quantum-computational tasks in one- and two-dimensional\nspin lattices with tunable dipolar interactions has been known for some years [176];\nhowever, until the work of Kay [153], the performance of a spin chain with long-range\ncouplings as a communication channel had never been investigated. The study detailed in this chapter represents the first rigorous attempt to analyze the dynamics\nof quantum state transfer in a chain of spins coupled by the magnetic dipole interaction. Thanks to recent advances in ion- and electron- trapping technology, several\npossible implementations of the present scheme have come to light. These, together\nwith subsequent newly published extensions to the scheme, will be discussed in\nsection 8.6.\nThe protocol described here is, in essence, a mapping of Bose's original communication scheme to a system in which all the spins are coupled to each other via a\nlong-range magnetic interaction that scales as r \u22123 . I examine a simplified system\nin which any external magnetic field is constant and parallel to the axis joining the\ndipoles. This axis is chosen to coincide with the z-direction, so that the z-component\nof the total magnetization M is conserved (cfr. equation 7.2). It is therefore possible\nto work in the single excitation sub-space, which grows linearly in the size of the\nsystem (see Section 7.3.1). Within this subspace, the effect of the magnetic field\nis to add a constant to the energies. This constant will hereafter be omitted. For\nsimplicity, it will also be assumed that the system is at zero temperature, hence\ncontains no thermally excited spin-flips. Unless otherwise stated natural units will\nbe used, such that \u03bc0 = \u03bcB = ~ = me = 1.\n\n8.2\n\nThe General Dipolar Hamiltonian\n\nThe magnetic dipole coupling between two particles separated by a distance rij \u1e91\ncan be expressed as follows\nHij =\n\nC\n[Si * Sj \u2212 3Szi Szj ],\n3\n|rij |\n\n(8.1)\n\nwhere Si and Sj are the total spin operators at sites ri and rj , and Szi and Szj are\ntheir respective z -components. The value of C is determined by the type of particle\n\n\f162\n\nChapter 8. Quantum State Transfer with Long-Range Interactions\n\none considers; for a system of spin- 12 fermions such as electrons, C is given by\nC=\n\n\u03bc0 (\u03bcB ge )2\n,\n4\u03c0~2\n\nwhere ge is the electron g-factor. In natural units, the value of C is then C \u2261\n\n(8.2)\nge2\n.\n4\u03c0\n\nAs\n\nthe majority of the following discussion will be concerned with uniform systems, it\nis useful to define the interaction strength between anti-aligned nearest neighbours\n\u01eb = |hj|H|j \u00b1 1i| =\n\nC\n,\n2a3\n\n(8.3)\n\nwhere a \u2261 |rj, j\u00b11 | is the nearest-neighbour spacing. Length, energy and time units\nare hereafter defined by setting a and \u01eb to unity. This does not affect the qualitative\nbehaviour of the system, as equation (8.1) has an overall scaling factor of a3 ; hence,\na uniform compression or expansion of the system simply re-scales all energies by\na constant. Consequently, for a fixed number of component spins, the energy and\nperformance of a system of any size can be extrapolated by adjusting the value of a\nas necessary.\nThe above considerations are entirely general. The specific form of the energy spectrum and Hamiltonian of the system are determined by the geometry. I will consider\ntwo cases: the closed and the open chain. These two systems differ in that the latter\nhas end points, but the former does not. In other words, the closed chain is a linear\nsystem obeying periodic boundary conditions, whereas the open chain is a linear\nsystem not obeying periodic boundary conditions. For brevity, I will refer to the\nclosed chain as a ring, however it must be noted this does not in any way assume a\ncircular geometry.\n\n\fChapter 8.

Quantum State Transfer with Long-Range Interactions\n\n164\n\nflip a spin with respect to the ground state is independent of position along the ring.\nTo calculate the eigenspectrum, we recall that the single excitation eigenvectors of\na periodic system are single-magnon Bloch states. Labeling these states with |mi,\none has\n\nN\n1 X ikm *rj\n|mi = \u221a\ne\n|j i,\nN j=1\n\n(8.11)\n\nwhere km is the magnitude of the Bloch wavevector, rj is the position of the spin at\nsite j, and |j i is the single spin-flip state.\nIf the nearest neighbour separation is set to unity, one has |rj | = j \u2212 1, as the origin\n\nrj = 0 coincides with the first site of the ring. Since the excitations travel along the\ndipole axis, it follows that km * rj = km (j \u2212 1). The eigenenergies of the ring can\ntherefore be expressed as follows\n\nEm = hm|H|mi =\n\n1 X ikm (j\u2212j \u2032 ) \u2032\ne\nhj |H|j i,\nN j, j \u2032\n\n(8.12)\n\nwhere the sum runs over all pairs j 6= j \u2032 .\nAccording to condition (8.5), for a given j there exist N2 (even N) or N 2\u22121 (odd N)\nindependent values of |j \u2212 j \u2032 |. The sum over j \u2032 contains twice this number of terms,\nbecause it must account for positive and negative values of (j \u2212 j \u2032 ). It follows that,\nfor a given j and even N 1\n\nN\n\nX\nj, j\n\n\u2032\n\neikm (j\u2212j hj \u2032 |H|j i =\n\u2032)\n\n2\nX\n\n(j\u2212 j\n\n\u2032 )=\u2212 N\n2\n\neikm (j\u2212j\n\n\u2032)\n\n\u01eb\n,\n|j \u2212 j \u2032 |3\n\n(8.13)\n\nwhere we have used the fact that interaction energies of distant neighbours {j, j \u2032 }\n\nare obtained by scaling the nearest-neighbour coupling by a factor |j \u2212 j \u2032 |3 . Finally,\n1\n\nThe term in j = j \u2032 is neglected.\n\n\fChapter 8.

The corresponding expression for odd N is obtained by simply\nchanging the upper limit of the summation to j = (N \u2212 1)/2.\nEquations (7.5), (7.8), (8.11) and (8.14) are now sufficient to provide a full characterization of the time-evolution of the fidelity of state transfer in a dipolar ring.\n\n8.4\n\nThe Performance of a Ring\n\nThanks to the symmetries of the ring geometry, the fidelity of state transfer can be\nexpressed in analytical form. To this end, it is convenient to write the propagator\nof equation (7.8) in more general terms as\nf (t)r, s =\n\nN\nX\n\nm=1\n\nhr|mihm|sie\u2212iEm t ,\n\n(8.15)\n\nwhere |si and |ri are the sender and receiver sites, respectively.

As the |j i states form an orthonormal set, the propagator between sites\nr and s is found to be\nf (t)r, s\n\nN \u22121\n1 X i 2\u03c0n(r\u2212s) \u2212iEn t\ne N e\n=\n,\nN n=0\n\nwith\n\n(8.18)\n\nN\n\nEn = 2\n\n2\nX\ncos 2\u03c0n j\n\nN\n\nj=1\n\nj3\n\n.\n\n(8.19)\n\nTo obtain the fidelity of state transfer, equations (8.18) and (8.19) are then substituted into (7.5), taking (r \u2212 s) = N2 or N 2\u22121 , for even and odd N respectively.\nThe evolution of the fidelity in time for N = 2 \u2212 7 is illustrated in figure 8.1. Figure\n8.2 (a) represents instead the maximum fidelity Fmax that can be achieved within\nan arbitrary time period T = 1000\nfor both a dipolar and a Heisenberg ring2 . The\n\u01eb\ndefinition of a cutoff time stems from the practical consideration that one cannot\nafford to wait indefinitely for the state to be transferred. To give a more complete\ndescription of the efficiency of the protocol, the time \u03c4 required to achieve fidelity\nFmax is also shown, in Figure 8.2 (b).\nFor N > 5, the fidelity is an unpredictable function of time. The maximal fidelity\nfalls rapidly with increasing N, though for even N the fidelity is systematically\nhigher. A comparison with a nearest-neighbour-coupled ring shows their average\nbehaviour is very evenly matched in both quality and speed, although at large\n(odd) N a Heisenberg ring has higher fidelity. The results illustrated in figure 8.2\nare complementary to those published in figure 1 of [177], though not completely\nidentical. In the majority of cases, this is owed to the fact that in [177] optimization\n. However,\nof the fidelity was carried out over the much shorter timescale of 500\n\u01eb\nthere exist additional numerical inconsistencies between the results presented in\nfigure 8.2(b) and those of figure 1(b) of [177], which occur at N = 6, 8, 9 and 16\nfor the dipolar ring, and N = 8, 12, and 24 for the Heisenberg ring. At N = 8,\n9, and 12 these arise from the fact that, upon repeating the analysis, it was found\nthat the value of the fidelity at the (longer) time of figure 1(b) of [177] exceeds that\nat the (shorter) time of figure 8.2(b) by O (10\u22123 ). Given such a small advantage,\n2\n\nFor a Heisenberg ring, the fidelity is easily obtained from equations (7.5) and (8.18) by setting\nthe eigenenergies EnH = \u22122J cos 2\u03c0n\nN (see Appendix C).\n\n\f167\n\nChapter 8. Quantum State Transfer with Long-Range Interactions\n\nit is more efficient overall to measure the output state at this shorter time, hence\nthe result presented here. The discrepancies at N = 6, 16, and 24 are unfortunately\nowed to a recently discovered indexing oversight, but this does not yield qualitative\ndisagreement with previous findings except in the case N = 16. Fortunately, this is\nnot sufficient to affect the conclusions drawn so far, both in [177] and in the present\nthesis.\nN=2\n\nN=3\n\n1.0\n\n0.80\n\n0.9\n\n0.75\n0.70\nFHtL\n\nFHtL\n\n0.8\n0.65\n\n0.7\n0.60\n0.6\n\n0.55\n\n0.5\n\n0.50\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nt\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nt\n\nN=4\n\nN=5\n\n1.0\n0.75\n0.9\n0.70\nFHtL\n\nFHtL\n\n0.8\n0.65\n\n0.7\n0.60\n0.6\n\n0.55\n\n0.5\n\n0.50\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n0\n\n100\n\n20\n\n40\n\nt\n\nt\n\nN=6\n\nN=7\n0.75\n\n0.9\n0.70\n\nFHtL\n\nFHtL\n\n0.8\n0.65\n\n0.7\n0.60\n0.6\n\n0.55\n\n0.5\n\n0.50\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\nt\n\nt\n\nFigure 8.1: The evolution of the fidelity at short times t \u2264\n\n100\n\u01eb\n\nfor N = 2 \u2212 7.\n\n\fChapter 8.

The fidelity is optimized over a time period T = 1000\n\u01eb . In SI units, the value\nof T depends on the inter-spin distance one chooses. For a chain of particles spaced at 3 \u00c5, say,\nthe dipolar interaction between nearest neighbours is approximately 4\u03bceV, roughly corresponding\nto a timescale of 10\u221210 s. The chosen cutoff time is then of order 100 ns, which is well within\nthe decoherence time of, for example, N@C60 [116, 117]. The black dot-dashed line indicates the\nmaximum fidelity for classical transmission of a quantum state.\n\n8.5\n\nState Transfer in a Dipolar Chain\n\nThe following section is dedicated to the analysis of quantum state transfer in a\ndipolar chain. The lack of periodicity resulting from the finite structure yields\n\n\fChapter 8. Quantum State Transfer with Long-Range Interactions\n\n169\n\nimportant qualitative differences between the chain and ring geometries, which from\nmany viewpoints render the chain the more efficient of the two quantum channels.\nAs we will see, the main drawback of the chain configuration is the length of time\nrequired for a quantum state to be optimally transferred, which remains essentially\nimpervious to most optimization techniques suggested so far. However, drawing also\non more recent work published earlier this year [178], the performance of the dipolar\nchain will be critically evaluated, to establish whether such a system will ever be\nuseful for anything other than proof-of-principle applications.\n\n8.5.1\n\nThe Hamiltonian\n\nIt is instructive to begin our analysis by calculating the Hamiltonian of the uniform\ndipolar chain. It is easily shown that the off-diagonal matrix elements are given\nby equation (8.4), but this time without recourse to condition (8.5). The quantity\n|j \u2212 j \u2032 | is therefore the linear distance between sites j and j \u2032 , irrespective of the\nvalues of these indices. The diagonal elements are calculated by evaluating the\nenergy gap between the ground state and the spin-flipped state |j i. Given the\nground-state energy\nN\n\u22121\nX\nN \u2212j\n,\n(8.20)\nh\u21d3 |H| \u21d3i = \u2212\n3\nj\nj=1\nit follows that\nhj|H|j i = h\u21d3 |H| \u21d3i + 2\n\nX\n\nj\n\n\u2032 6=j\n\n1\n.\n|j \u2032 \u2212 j|3\n\n(8.21)\n\nEquation (8.21) can be compared to (8.9) and (8.10) to highlight an extremely\nimportant characteristic of the chain geometry: the energy required to flip a spin\nfrom the ground-state configuration is dependent on the site of the spin flip, and\nreaches a minimum at sites 1 and N (Fig. 8.3). The first and final sites of the chain\nare therefore the most favourable environments for a spin flip to exist, which bodes\nextremely well for the prospect of transferring a spin flip between these sites. The\nfull implications of this result will be illustrated in greater detail in section 8.5.2.\n\n\fChapter 8.

The time evolution of the\nfidelity of state transfer between end sites is shown in figure 8.5 for N = 2 \u2212 7.\nIt is immediately evident that, provided a large enough sampling time is chosen, the\nbehaviour of a dipolar chain is substantially different from that of both a ring and\na Heisenberg chain. The first thing we observe is the presence of a regular - though\nslightly noisy - oscillation, whose amplitude is close to unity. This shows there exist\npredictable times at which the transfer process is close to being perfect. Second, the\nperiod of the oscillation is long and increases with N, which suggests transfer time\ngrows with the length of the chain. In some respects, this is a disadvantage; in others,\none could argue that a slow variation of the fidelity in time provides the receiving\nparty with a reasonably large window in which to measure their spin. Indeed, the\nfidelity remains at least above the classical threshold for roughly a quarter of a\nperiod either side of the peak.\nThe period of oscillation of F (t) is uniquely defined by the energy splitting \u2206\u03bb\nbetween the two lowest eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. The transfer process is\ntherefore dominated by the beating of two nearly degenerate states localized near\nthe ends of the chain. As noted in the previous section, this behaviour is explained\nby the variation of the on-site energies of the spins as a function of j; it is clear\n\n\f171\n\nChapter 8. Quantum State Transfer with Long-Range Interactions\n\nfrom fig. 8.3 that the most favourable positions for a spin to flip are sites 1 and\nN. Consequently, states |1i and |Ni are the most strongly coupled to the system's\n(two) bound states, which are shown in fig. 8.4. In a dipolar chain, this phenomenon\nis a natural consequence of the geometry, but systems in which the spin flip energy\nis specifically chosen site by site have also been studied [179].\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\nDEm\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nN\n\nFigure 8.4: The energy splitting \u2206Em between the ground state | \u21d3 i and states with a single\nflipped spin, which shows the evolution of the two bound states.

This is a marked improvement on a Heisenberg chain;\nspecifically, it is no longer the case that the fidelity is poor when N is a multiple of 3\n[126]. These high fidelities are achieved at the cost of long transfer times; indeed, at\nlarge N, t0 (N) is proportional to the cube of the chain length (fig. 8.6). One is forced\nto conclude that, unless optimization strategies can be found, the time required to\ncomplete the protocol will become impractical as the chain length increases.\n\n\fChapter 8.

Here, the black dot-dashed line represents the function y = (N \u2212 1)3 . At large N , this\nis parallel to the red dotted curve, indicating that the transfer time in a dipolar chain scales as\nthe cube of the chain length. In absolute terms, for a chain of particles spaced by 3 \u00c5, say, unit\ntime corresponds to O(10\u221210 ) s. Transfer times for chains longer than 20 spins therefore exceed\nthe micro-second mark.\n\nFollowing the work of Kay [153] and Osborne and Linden [138], two main optimization methods will be investigated. The first consists of changing the encoding and\nmeasurement convention so that the sending and receiving parties have access to\nmore than one spin at the ends of the chain. I refer to this as input and measurement optimization. The second involves changing the geometric properties of the\n\n\fChapter 8. Quantum State Transfer with Long-Range Interactions\n\n174\n\nchain, such as the number of spins or their placement. I refer to this as structural\noptimization.\n\n8.5.3\n\nInput and Measurement Optimization\n\nLet us begin by asking whether the performance of the protocol can be boosted by\nallowing Alice and Bob manipulate the first and last two spins of the chain. For\nexample, suppose Alice wishes to transmit the state |1i. Rather than encoding this\nstate in the first spin only, Alice encodes it in the first two spins, generating the\ninitial state\n|si = c1 |1i + c2 |2i.\n\n(8.24)\n\nFollowing the discussion of the previous section, it is advantageous to choose the\ncoefficients c1 and c2 so as to maximize the overlap of |si with one of the system's\n\nbound states, as these dominate the transfer. The eigenvectors of the system are\nsymmetrized and antisymmetrized combinations of |ji-states, having the form |mi =\nPN m\nm\nm\nm\nj=1 aj |ji, with |ai | = |aN \u22121+i |, and ai \u2208 R. For either of the bound states (m = 1\n\nm\nand m = 2), the amplitudes {am\n3 * * * aN \u22122 } decrease steadily with N; hence, most of\nthe amplitude is concentrated on the first and last two sites. Suppose Alice takes\n\nthe first of these bound states as her 'reference' state; she should then choose the\ncoefficients c1 and c2 to be as close as possible to a11 and a12 , while still obeying the\nnormalization condition c21 + c22 = 1.\nBob must now establish which output state |ri to aim for. Knowing as he does\nm\nthe criterion Alice has adopted to fix her c1 and c2 , and also that |am\ni | = |aN \u22121+i |,\n\nhe chooses |ri = c2 |N-1i + c1 |Ni. The propagator of equation (7.8) can then be\nexpressed as\nN\nX\n\u0001 iEm t\nm\nm\nm\n.\n(8.25)\nf (t) =\n(c1 am\n1 + c2 a2 ) c2 aN \u22121 + c1 aN e\nm=1\n\nThe outcome of this optimization procedure for a chain of 7 spins is shown in figure\n8.7. Comparing with figure 8.5, it is evident that the transfer time has remained\nunaffected. However, we have been successful in smoothing out the oscillation and\n\nboosting its amplitude even closer to unity. This agrees completely with the result\nof [138]; indeed, the quality of the transfer can be further improved if Alice and Bob\nare have access to an even larger portion of the chain, as shown in figure 8.7(b).\n\n\f175\n\nChapter 8.

We find that the characteristic\noscillation of F (t) is lost, unless either |si = |2i and |ri = |Ni, or |si = |1i and\n|ri = |N - 1i [figure 8.8(b)]. However, in both cases the signal is considerably\nnoisier, and the maximum fidelity is greatly reduced. This is a result of the lesser\nefficiency of coupling to the bound states as one moves away from the ends of the\nchain (cfr. fig. 8.4).\nConversely, fidelities in excess of 0.8 can be attained if sites s and r are symmetric3\n(Figure 8.8). In this case also the oscillatory pattern is lost, as the eigenstates\nthat dominate the transfer are well-separated in energy. In return, however, for\nN < 23 the fidelity can peak at times shorter than \u03c4 /2. The system is therefore\nmore efficient, though less predictable. Furthermore, the choice of symmetric sites\nimplies Alice and Bob must be capable of site-specific encoding and measurement\nat arbitrary positions in the chain; in other words, they must be able to act upon\na more or less extended portion of the chain containing sites s (Alice) or r (Bob).\nFrom a practical viewpoint, this is much more demanding than end control only.\nWe conclude that by optimizing the encoding and decoding operations whilst remaining in control of the end spins only, Alice and Bob can ensure perfect transmission of quantum information. However, the problem of excessively long transfer\ntimes still remains. This is not surprising, as the transfer time is determined by the\n3\n\nA mathematical justification of this result was recently published in [178].\n\n\f176\n\nChapter 8.

It is therefore clear that to\nact on the transfer time one must change the Hamiltonian, and as the Hamiltonian\nis proportional to the spacing of the spins, it can only be modified by changing the\nstructural properties of the chain.\nHaL: s=3, r=9\n\nHbL: s=1, r=14\n\n0.80\n0.75\n0.75\n0.70\n\nFHtL\n\nFHtL\n\n0.70\n0.65\n\n0.65\n0.60\n\n0.60\n\n0.55\n\n0.55\n\n0.50\n\n0.50\n0\n\n10 000\n\n20 000\n\n0\n\n30 000\n\n10 000\n\n20 000\n\n30 000\n\nt\n\nt\nHcL: s=3, r=13\n0.9\n\nFHtL\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n0\n\n400\n\n800\nt\n\nFigure 8.8: The evolution of the fidelity for N = 15, when the initial and final states are (a) chosen\nat random, (b) taken as |si = |1i and |ri = |14i, and (c) symmetric (|si = |3i and |ri = |13i). We\nnote that in (c) the fidelity peaks within the time limit T = 1000\nimposed for the ring geometry.\n\u01eb\n\n8.5.4\n\nStructural Optimization: Non-Uniform Chains\n\nIt has already been suggested in [153] that non-uniform chains may offer some advantages over uniform systems. To continue this line of investigation, we study a\nchain in which the placement of the spins is uneven, though not random. There are\nseveral ways to obtain such a structure; here, we imagine compressing or expanding\nsome part of a uniform chain by a fixed amount. The system can then be described\nin terms of four parameters: (a) the number of spins in the chain, N; (b) the number\nof evenly spaced spins before the compressed (expanded) region, i; (c) the number\nof evenly spaced spins after the compressed (expanded) region, f ; (d) the spacing\n\n\fChapter 8. Quantum State Transfer with Long-Range Interactions\n\n177\n\nof the spins in the compressed (expanded) region, \u03b4. The Hamiltonian remains that\nof equation (8.1), except the overall scaling factor of 1/a3 is now lost.\nFigure 8.9 shows the performance of a chain of 10 spins for different {N, i, f, \u03b4}\ncombinations with i 6= f . It has been assumed that the 'default' spin spacing is a,\nhence \u03b4 is expressed in units of a. We observe that when the chain is not mirrorsymmetric the fidelity is poor irrespective of the choice of parameters. Conversely,\nif the chain has mirror symmetry (i = f ) it is again possible to achieve high-quality\nstate transfer between all symmetric sites, as illustrated in figure 8.10. The times of\npeak fidelity vary considerably; however, for a given s and r, these times are shorter\nif the central section of the chain has been compressed (i.e. \u03b4 < 1). This is not\nsurprising, as compressing the central section shortens the chain.\nIf the chain is non uniform but mirror-symmetric, the time evolution of the fidelity\nof state transfer between the end sites exhibits a regular oscillatory behaviour, which\nis different from that of a uniform chain. The details of the oscillation depend on\nwhether the chain has been expanded or compressed in the central region. If the\nchain has been expanded, the transfer is no longer dominated by the bound states\nbut by the four upper-lying eigenstates of the system. This is a consequence of the\ngeometry, as the end spins are now closer together (hence more strongly coupled)\nrelative to the spins in the mid-section of the chain. As a result, there are now at\nleast three clearly discernable frequencies beating against each other. The first is\nthe frequency of the slowly varying envelope function, which is determined by the\nsplitting of the third and fourth highest eigenenergies of the system. The second\ncharacterizes the rapid oscillation within the envelope, and is determined by the\nenergy splitting of the highest and second-highest eigenstates. In turn, this serves\nas an envelope for an even faster oscillation, whose period is defined by the energy\ngap of the highest and third-highest eigenstates. These details are shown in figure\n8.11. The peak fidelity is again close to unity, but the transfer now takes even longer\nthan in a uniform chain, because expanding the central section of the chain increases\nits length.\nSimilar results are found for compressed chains with the exception that, as in uniform\nchains, we are concerned with the bottom of the energy spectrum rather than the\ntop. The frequency of the outer envelope is therefore determined by the energy\nsplitting of the two lowest-lying eigenstates, the frequency within this envelope is\n\n\f178\n\nChapter 8. Quantum State Transfer with Long-Range Interactions\n\ndetermined by the energy splitting of the third and fourth lowest-lying eigenstates,\nand so on. The transfer is quicker than in a uniform chain, as compressing the centre\nof the chain makes it shorter.\ni=2, f=3, \u2206=0.8\n\ni=5, f=1, \u2206=0.8\n\nFHtL\n\nFHtL\n\n0.512\n0.510\n\n0.515\n\n0.508\n0.510\n\n0.506\n0.504\n\n0.505\n\n0.502\nt\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nt\n0\n\n200\n\ni=2, f=3, \u2206=2\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\ni=5, f=1, \u2206=3\n\nFHtL\n\nFHtL\n\n0.5005\n\n0.50010\n\n0.5004\n\n0.50008\n\n0.5003\n\n0.50006\n\n0.5002\n\n0.50004\n\n0.5001\n\n0.50002\nt\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nt\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nFigure 8.9: The fidelity of state transfer between sites 1 and 10 of a ten-spin chain.

The plot to the right of each figure\nis a 'zoom-in' of the boxed region.\n\nIn conclusion, we find that expanding or compressing the chain while keeping the\nnumber of spins fixed can offer some degree of speed-up over a uniform geometry\nprovided the transfer takes place between symmetric spins not located at the ends.\nHowever, this comes at the price of losing the regular oscillation which allows us to\npredict when the fidelity will peak. It would therefore be more desirable to find a\nway to minimize the transfer time while preserving the fidelity's periodic behaviour.\nThis brings us to our last attempt at optimization, which will investigate whether\nthe performance of a chain of a given length depends on the number of component\nspins.\n\n8.5.5\n\nStructural Optimization: Fixed length Chains\n\nIn order to analyze the relationship between the efficiency of state transfer and the\nnumber of spins for a fixed chain length L, we define t\u22170 as the transmission time\n\n\fChapter 8.

Fig. 8.13 shows the development of t\u22170 with increasing N, and\nreveals two interesting features. The first is the asymptotic behaviour of t\u22170 at large\nN; this suggests there exists a threshold length above which the central part of the\nchain ceases to play a role in the transfer. In other words, the evolution of the\nsystem is determined almost exclusively by the coupling between the first and last\ni spins, irrespective of the number of spins that separate them.\n12\n10\n\nt0 *\n\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nN\n\nFigure 8.13: The behaviour of t\u22170 as a function of the number of spins in the chain. Note the\nminimum at N = 4 and the flatness of the curve for N > 15. Units are as specified in Section 8.1.\n\nTo explore this hypothesis, and determine the behaviour of t\u22170 for large N, we work\nwith states |Bi and |Ei localized on the first and last i spins of the chain, respectively.\n\nThese are the bound-state eigenfunctions of a semi-infinite chain extending to the\nright and the left, and can be expressed as follows\n|Bi =\n|Ei =\n\ni\nX\n\nn=1\ni\nX\nn=1\n\nan |ni,\n\n(8.27)\n\nan |N + 1 - ni.\n\n(8.28)\n\nLet us now assume the coefficients an are non-zero only if (j, j \u2032 ) \u2264 i or (j, j \u2032 ) \u2265\nN + 1 \u2212 i.

Note the model is only\naccurate at N > 13.\n\nIt emerges that the asymptotic behaviour of the system can be modeled very accurately if the coefficients an are taken to be the amplitudes of the ground state\neigenvector of the i \u00d7 i sub-matrix of the original dipolar Hamiltonian. The values\nof an used in the fit of figure 8.14 are thus obtained from the dipolar Hamiltonian\nof a 14-spin chain, with i = 4. The corresponding values of Q and R are Q \u2248 0.325\nand R \u2248 \u22120.957. These quantities show only a very weak dependence on N, so they\nhave been treated as constants. The fact that Q < 1 indicates that, at large N,\nthe transfer rate is always less than that attained between two completely isolated\nspins; equation (8.37) indicates this is a result of interference between positive and\nnegative components in the localized states |Bi and |Ei.\nAt small N, however, this is clearly not the case, as shown by the minimum in\nfig. 8.13 at N = 4. The concavity of the curve between N = 2 and N = 7 indicates\nthat only chains with less than 7 spins can improve on the performance of a simple\ndipole pair; specifically, in a uniform chain of a given length, the best compromise\n\n\fChapter 8. Quantum State Transfer with Long-Range Interactions\n\n185\n\nbetween the quality and the speed of the communication is obtained with 4 spins.\nThis occurs because for small N the bound states at the ends of the chain have\na large overlap, i.e. there exist terms in eqn. (8.31) which simultaneously have\nsignificant positive values of a\u2217n am and small values of |N + 1 \u2212 m \u2212 n|.\nThe uniform 4-spin chain can be optimized still further by symmetrically moving the\ninner spins slightly closer to the ends, so that r1,2 = r3,4 \u2248 0.312L and r2,3 \u2248 0.375L.\n\nThe resulting transfer rate is then t\u2217\u2032\n0 \u2248 0.512, which is a 10% improvement on the\nvalue one finds for a uniform system, t\u22170 \u2248 0.568. Considering the extra difficulty\n\ninvolved in such high precision placement of the spins, it is probably not useful to\nadopt this optimization technique as a rule. However, viewed from another angle,\nour result also indicates that if a symmetric error were made in the placement of\nthe central spins, the protocol would not necessarily be compromised.\nTo explore in more detail the robustness of the protocol against structural imperfections in the chain, we can study the effect of introducing a random error on the\nplacement of each spin. To evaluate whether there is a significant drop in performance, I have counted over 1000 iterations the number of times the fidelity of a 4-spin\nchain of arbitrary length, measured at the optimal time t0 = Lt\u22170 , falls below 2/3.\n\u2264 \u2206 \u2264 pL\n],\nIt has been assumed the magnitude of the error lies in the interval [\u2212 pL\n3\n3\nwith p \u2208 [0, 1] so that the maximum allowed deviation of a spin is the distance to the\nnext (or previous) site. As one might expect, the performance of the system is found\nto depend on the magnitude of \u2206. If \u2206 \u2264 0.01L, the fidelity at time t0 rarely drops\n\nbelow the classical threshold. However, as \u2206 increases the number of instances of\npoor performance grow, and by the time \u2206 \u2248 0.03L the system is failing more than\n\n50% of the time. Let us now be more demanding and raise the lower limit of the\nfidelity to 0.8; in this case, an error of \u2206 \u2264 0.01L yields a 25% failure rate, and\nat \u2206 \u2248 0.07L the system can essentially be written off. These statistics may seem\n\ndiscouraging, but we must remember that as L becomes large the absolute value of\n\u2206 also increases. Hence, in terms of precision requirements, long chains are more\nversatile than short ones because they allow more leeway for experimental error in\nthe placement of the spins.\n\n\fChapter 8. Quantum State Transfer with Long-Range Interactions\n\n8.6\n\n186\n\nExtensions and Experimental Implementations\n\nIn section 7.5, several methods for implementing quantum state transfer with short\nrange interactions were reviewed. Among them, endohedral fullerenes are the leading\ncandidates for the protocol discussed here, though natural magnetic dipolar systems,\nsuch as LiHoF4 , should also be taken into account [180]. Trapped ions are currently\nemerging as ideal subjects for one- and two-dimensional quantum manipulations.\nIndeed, as widely demonstrated by a variety of impressive experiments [36, 181, 182,\n183, 184], ions can be efficiently cooled, initialized, entangled, read out and, most\nimportantly in the present context, stored at fixed positions. Ion microtraps allow\nthe highest degree of control over the qubits' placement, as each ion is individually\nconfined. Linear traps can be used to create linear arrays, whereas confinement in\ntwo dimensions is achieved with Penning traps. In these systems, however, the single\nionic positions cannot be fixed to the same degree of precision. In all three cases,\nthe trapping potential is provided by a series of orthogonal electric and magnetic\nfields, whereas the inter-qubit interactions are mediated by common vibrational\nmodes, usually tuned with directed laser pulses. It has recently been shown that by\nadjusting the trapping potential and the laser frequencies, it is possible to simulate a\ndipolar Hamiltonian similar to equation (8.1). This involves accessing the so-called\n'stiff' vibrational modes, in which the Coulomb repulsion of the trapped qubits can\nbe considered a perturbation on the trapping potential.\nMotivated by these findings, new effort is being dedicated to optimizing quantum\nstate transmission through dipolar chains [178]. An interesting proposal, advanced\nearlier this year, involves a system known as the 'double hole (DH) chain'. This is\na linear chain of uniformly spaced, magnetic-dipole coupled spins, from which the\nparticles at sites 2 and N \u2212 1 have been removed, isolating the end spins from the\nmiddle of the chain. As a result, the transfer process is faster than in a 'complete'\nchain, and unit fidelities are achieved even in chains of over 80 spins. One can\nshow that, by continuing to symmetrically remove spins, the performance of the DH\nchain can be further improved; however, no matter how many times the process is\nrepeated, for a given chain length the lower bound for the transfer time is still that\nprovided by a uniform four-spin system (figure 8.15). Nevertheless, a 'many hole'\nchain may have other advantages; indeed, it is argued in [178] that by splitting off\nthe sending and receiving spins from the mid-section of the chain, perturbations in\n\n\f187\n\nChapter 8.

It is evident from figure (b) that the minimum\ntransfer time is achieved in a uniform four-spin chain.\n\nA dipolar Hamiltonian can also be simulated in a solid-state spin system, using\nnuclear magnetic resonance [185, 186]. Most recent work in this area relates to\nthe appearance of multiple correlations between different parts of the spin chain,\nwhich can generate entanglement between distant spins. Interestingly, it is observed\nthat long-distance entanglement is more likely to persist if the spins are coupled by\nnearest-neighbour interactions only.\n\n8.7\n\nConclusions\n\nUnmodulated spin chains with long-range dipolar interactions allow high quality\ntransfer of quantum information. Periodic systems do not perform as well as finite\nchains, particularly if the component number of spins is even. Nevertheless, for\nsystems of up to 30 spins, a dipolar ring often outdoes its nearest-neighbour coupled\ncounterpart. In general, the fidelity of the channel is a decreasing function of chain\nlength. If the chain is periodic, the fidelity falls quite rapidly with N; however,\n\n\fChapter 8. Quantum State Transfer with Long-Range Interactions\n\n188\n\nin a finite chain the optimal fidelity remains well above the classical threshold for\nchains of up to 100 spins [178]. Furthermore, in a linear system the fidelity peaks at\npredictable times, and its dynamics are such to ensure the receiver has a reasonably\nample window of opportunity in which to retrieve their spin. Both these factors\nare owed to the fact that the transfer process is dominated by the two end spins.\nThe presence of the mid-section of the chain registers merely as noise; indeed, the\nmore one separates the end spins from the mid-section, the better the fidelity. For\na uniform chain of given length, the number of component spins is relevant to the\noverall performance of the system, which peaks when N = 4.\nThe main drawback of the linear chain geometry is the time required for the state\nto be transferred, which grows as the cube of the chain length. Recent work has\nmanaged to reduce this figure by a factor of three, however in absolute terms this\nis not a sizeable advantage, because the transfer time in chains longer than L = 20\nstill remains of micro-second order. Therefore, if all factors are taken into account,\na dipolar chain is a less efficient communication channel than a nearest-neighbour\ncoupled chain. However, evaluating the effect of dipolar couplings on quantum state\ntransfer is a valuable exercise, because any practical implementation of spin-chain\ncommunication would most likely be carried out in systems exhibiting both types\nof couplings, though perhaps not in equal measure. One could therefore imagine\nengineering the relative strengths of the nearest-neighbour and dipolar interactions\nso as to generate constructive interference, thus yielding a fidelity higher than that\nachievable by either effect taken separately.\n\n\fChapter 9\nSummary and Future Work\nThe past 50 years have witnessed the evolution of Quantum Information Technology\nfrom a theoretical construct to a tangible reality. Most recently, the field has been\ndeveloping at a truly impressive rate, and seems on the verge of a leap of quality\ndespite several outstanding issues, mainly related to preserving quantum properties\nfor long enough to perform useful tasks. This thesis has explored means to achieve\nthe extremely desirable goals of quantum communication over short distances in\nsolid-state devices, and experimental entanglement generation. Novel techniques to\nattain these goals have been suggested, and related practical difficulties have been\ndiscussed.\nChapter 2 was dedicated to an overview of quantum entanglement and its basic\nproperties. Methods to quantify and measure entanglement were also analyzed.\nChapter 3 put forward a proposal for a scattering experiment designed to create entanglement between distinct neutrons. The protocol was illustrated in detail,\ntogether with the approximations underlying the mathematical model of the experiment. Given the possibility of describing the system in terms of pure states,\nit was decided that the scattering event should be treated using a time-dependent\nquantum mechanical analysis. In Chapter 4 it was verified that if no momentum\nis transferred between the incident neutron and the sample, the neutron interaction\ntime can be identified with its free-flight time through the sample.\nIn Chapter 5, the performance of the scattering protocol at zero momentum trans189\n\n\fChapter 9. Summary and Future Work\n\n190\n\nfer was assessed. It was found that the first pair of neutrons to scatter from a sample\nhaving the properties of a ferromagnetic insulator could come to share a substantial\ndegree of measurable entanglement, subject to the possibility of applying a static\nexternal magnetic field of tuneable strength. The experimental feasibility of the\nprotocol was discussed, and it was concluded that the only true obstacle to a practical realization stemmed from the coherence properties of the neutron beam. These\nproperties depend only on beam preparation apparatus and technique. Therefore,\nthe protocol may indeed become feasible as neutron facilities become better equipped\nand more refined.\nChapter 6 extended the scope of the entangling proposal to account for the possibility of many neutrons scattering from the sample. The aim of the chapter was to\nestablish whether a measurement on any pair of neutrons detected within a certain\ntime of each other would yield an entangled state. It was shown that the average\nentanglement of any pair is at best of order 0.1 ebits. This falls with the size of the\nsampling ensemble of outgoing neutrons. Consequently, to produce highly entangled\nstates it is necessary to detect one of the very first scattered pairs. The emerging\ntrends are interesting from a more fundamental viewpoint also, as they provide a\npractical means to establish whether or not two distinct neutrons can in fact be\nentangled.\nIn Chapter 7, the focus shifted from entanglement generation to quantum information transfer in the solid state. The chapter was dedicated to a review of quantum\ncommunication through spin chains, and a detailed analysis of the pioneering proposal of Bose [126]. Recent experimental implementations of this proposal were also\ndiscussed.\nFinally, Chapter 8 analyzed the performance of dipolar chains as conduits of quantum information. It was found that near-perfect transfer can be achieved without\nany special engineering of the system, but at the cost of long transfer times. Possible\noptimization methods were explored, and it was concluded that for a given distance\nthe optimal balance between quality and speed was obtained with a uniform chain\nof four spins. Recent theoretical and experimental work on dipolar systems was also\nreported.\nMuch of this work has been concerned with simulating possible experimental con-\n\n\fChapter 9. Summary and Future Work\n\n191\n\nditions. As with many theoretical models, this leaves a great deal of scope for\nrefining underlying approximations to attain a more faithful description of reality.\nConsequently, there are several directions in which future work might proceed.\nIn the context of neutron entanglement, a first question to ask might be how the\nprotocol is affected when the temperature is raised above zero. Simple preliminary\ncalculations suggest that if scattering takes place from a thermal state of the sample\nthe outcome of the protocol is determined by the relative magnitude of the thermal\nenergy to all other energy scales in the problem. Due to heavy computational\ndemands, only small systems have been considered so far. It would be interesting to\nlook at larger systems, and in greater detail. One could also examine the effect of\nchanging the properties of the sample, and in this respect the possibilities are clearly\nboundless. Samples with different electrical properties (metals, semi-conductors,\nsuperconductors...) or more realistic anisotropies could be considered.\nAs regards quantum state transfer through dipolar spin chains, it may be interesting\nto re-asses the performance of the protocol in the presence of mixed short- and longrange interactions. A slightly more ambitious goal might be to scale up from a single\nspin chain, and study the flow of information around some form of 'dipolar quantum\nnetwork'.\nThe problem of time in scattering theory also offers huge scope for further investigation. From a very brief survey of the field, it would seem the matter has been 'on the\ntable' for the past fifty years at least, and still no unique resolution exists. As commented in chapter 4, this may be due to a dependence on the context. Indeed, much\nof the literature tends to explore very specific scenarios. One could therefore begin\nwith an extensive survey of work done to date, to identify results of general validity\nand gain insight on the most efficient way to tackle the problem. Some research into\nthe dynamical theory of neutron scattering may also prove enlightening.\nAs a final word, I would like to say that the past three years have been an\nincredible experience, which has taught me a great many things about myself in\nboth a professional and a personal capacity. I have often felt the only thing that\ncould have prepared me to do a PhD would have been... to do a PhD! Paraphrasing\nslightly the words of Cervantes' legendary Don Quixote: I have struggled, I have\nmade mistakes, but I have done this work as best I can according to the world as I\n\n\fChapter 9. Summary and Future Work\n\n192\n\nsee it.\nOne of the most precious things I have learnt is what it takes for me to truly understand a concept and make it mine. I discovered this rather late in my PhD - perhaps\nI was not in a position to see it sooner, but that is another story. What matters is\nthat I have rediscovered the joy of questioning, and the freedom to question what I\nwish. I hope to carry that feeling of wonder and adventure into any work I may do\nin the future, conveying it to those around me always. Thank you for listening.\n\n\fAppendix A\nThe S-Matrix Method\nThe S-matrix formalism was originally proposed by Heisenberg in the early 1940s,\nas an attempt to reformulate quantum field theory in terms of observable quantities\n[187]. This project, which became known as the S-matrix program, was abandoned\nsoon after, but laid the foundations for the future developments of scattering theory\nat the hand of, among others, Gell-Mann and Goldberger [109], and Lippmann\nand Schwinger. The treatment I present here is that of [109], which describes the\nemergence of an operator akin to the Heisenberg S-matrix from the interaction\nrepresentation.\nConsider a scattering system represented by a Hamiltonian H = K + V , where\nK represents the kinetic energy of the system, and V represents the scattering\npotential. Let us denote with \u03a6i (t) = \u03c6i e\u2212iEi t the stationary state solutions to the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation (SE) in the absence of the potential, where the \u03c6i are solutions\nof the time-independent SE. The full SE takes eigenstates \u03a8(t), such that\ni\n\n\u2202\u03a8(t)\n= (K + V ) \u03a8(t).\n\u2202t\n\n(A.1)\n\nWe work in the approximation that interaction timescales are negligible with respect\nto measurement timescales. Therefore, the initial and measured states of the system\ncoincide with eigenstates of K. Suppose, then, we wished to calculate the crosssection for scattering from initial state \u03a6j to final state \u03a6i at some convenient time\nt = 0. To describe the history of the system up until the moment t = 0, one can\n\n193\n\n\fAppendix A\n\nrepresent the initial state \u03a8j (0) as a superposition of \u03a6j states, i.e. as a 'train' of\nwaves released at some time T in the distant past and fed into the sample over a\nprolonged period of time. Hence\n\u03a8j (t) =\n\nR0\n\n\u2212\u03c4\n\ne\u01ebT e\u2212iH(t\u2212T ) \u03a6j (T )dT\n,\nR0\ndT\n\u2212\u03c4\n\n(A.2)\n\nwhere \u03c4 = \u01eb\u22121 will eventually be taken to the limit of +\u221e, and the factor of e\u01ebT is\nincluded to ensure the integral converges in this limit.\nLet us now define an interaction representation wavefunction \u03a8\u2032 by\n\u03a8\u2032 (t) = eiKt \u03a8(t),\n\n(A.3)\n\nsuch that \u03a8\u2032 (0) = \u03a8(0). The SE for \u03a8\u2032 (t) reads\ni\n\n\u2202\u03a8\u2032 (t)\n= V (t) \u03a8\u2032 (t),\n\u2202t\n\n(A.4)\n\nV (t) = eiKt V e\u2212iKt .\n\n(A.5)\n\nwith\n\n\u03a8\u2032 (t) can be written in terms of \u03a8\u2032 (t0 ) at some time t0 with the help of the timeevolution operator:\n\u03a8\u2032 (t) = U (t, t0 ) \u03a8\u2032 (t0 ).\n\n(A.6)\n\nKnowing that \u03a8(t) = e\u2212iHt \u03a8(t0 ), equations (A.3) and (A.6) then give\nU (t, t0 ) = eiKt e\u2212i(K+V )(t\u2212t0 ) e\u2212iKt0 .\n\n(A.7)\n\nBy differentiating U (t, t0 ) with respect to t and substituting back the form of (A.7)\nand (A.5), one finds a SE for the time-evolution operator:\ni\n\n\u2202U (t, t0 )\n= V (t) U (t, t0 ) .\n\u2202t\n\n(A.8)\n\nIntegrating both sides from t0 to t then gives\nU (t, t0 ) = 1 \u2212 i\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nV (t\u2032 ) U (t\u2032 , t0 ) dt\u2032 .\n\n(A.9)\n\nt0\n\n194\n\n\fAppendix A\n\nBy repeating the same process, but with respect to t0 , we obtain\nU (t, t0 ) = 1 + i\n\nt0\n\nZ\n\nU (t, t\u2032 ) V (t\u2032 ) dt\u2032 .\n\n(A.10)\n\nt\n\nWith the help of Dyson's ordering operation [188], the solutions to equations (A.9)\nand (A.10) can be expressed as\n\u0012\n\u0014 Z t\n\u0015\u0013\n\u2032\n\u2032\nU (t, t0 ) = exp \u2212i\n,\nV (t ) dt\nt0\n\n\u0012\n\u0014 Z\nU (t, t0 ) = exp i\n\nt0\n\n+\n\nV (t\u2032 ) dt\u2032\n\nt\n\n(A.11)\n\n\u0015\u0013\n\n,\n\n(A.12)\n\n\u2212\n\nwhere the + (\u2212) subscripts indicate that terms in the series expansion should be\nwritten from left to right in order of decreasing (increasing) times. The Heisenberg\nS-matrix is often written as U (\u221e, \u2212\u221e). Therefore, we must now show that for the\nscattering process yielding the state (A.2), it is meaningful to extrapolate equation\n(A.7) to the limit of t, t0 = \u00b1\u221e.\nLet us transform (A.2) with the help of (A.3), letting \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e:\n\u03a8\u2032j (t)\n\niKt \u2212iHt\n\n=e\n\ne\n\n\u01eb\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ne\u01ebT eiHT e\u2212iKT \u03c6j dT,\n\n(A.13)\n\n\u2212\u03c4\n\nwhich becomes, from (A.7)\n\u03a8\u2032j (t)\n\n=\u01eb\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ne\u01ebT U (t, T ) \u03c6j dT.\n\n(A.14)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nWe take\nU (t, \u2212\u221e) = lim\u01eb\u21920+ \u01eb\nU (\u221e, t) = lim\u01eb\u21920+ \u01eb\n\n0\n\nZ\n\nZ\u2212\u221e\n\u221e\n\ne\u01ebT U (t, T ) dT,\n\n(A.15)\n\ne\u2212\u01ebT U (T, t) dT.\n\n(A.16)\n\n0\n\nBy thus defining our limits, it is possible to show that equations (A.9) and (A.10)\n\n195\n\n\fAppendix A\n\ndo indeed reduce to\nU (t, \u2212\u221e) = 1 \u2212 i\nU (t, \u221e) = 1 + i\n\nt\n\nZ\n\nZ\u2212\u221e\n\u221e\n\nV (t\u2032 ) U (t\u2032 , \u2212\u221e) dt\u2032 ,\n\n(A.17)\n\nU (t, t\u2032 ) V (t\u2032 ) dt\u2032 .\n\n(A.18)\n\nt\n\nWe therefore conclude that\nS \u2261 U (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) = 1 \u2212 i\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nV (t\u2032 ) U (t\u2032 , \u2212\u221e) dt\u2032 .\n\n(A.19)\n\nNow to justify the form of equation (A.7) as t0 \u2192 \u2212\u221e.

The structure of the VCS comprises a fuel element and liquid deuterium\nmoderator immersed in a pool of heavy water, all encased in concrete shielding.\nAs the neutrons interact with the moderator, the deuterium is heated to boiling\npoint. The vapour is then recondensed in a heat exchanger, and flows back into\nthe moderator vessel. The moderated neutrons are directed into a nickel guide,\nthe lower half of which is filled with helium to increase cooling. They emerge in a\nturbine house with five exit ports, part of which is occupied by a device known as\na Garching turbine. Half the beam feeds the turbine, which slows the neutrons to\nthe meV regime by total reflection along semi-circular nickel blades. These neutrons\nemerge as ultra-cold beams, whose cross section is determined by the exit port to\nwhich they are distributed. The remaining part of the beam bypasses the turbine,\nand emerges through the upper of the five exit ports at a velocity of approximately\n40 ms\u22121 . A schematic of the reactor and of the PF2 source is shown in figure B.1,\nbelow.\n\n198\n\n\fAppendix B\n\nFigure B.1: A schematic of the Vertical Cold Source (left) and of the PF2 instrument at the ILL, Grenoble.\nThe image of the VCS is reproduced from the website of the Technischen Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, which operates the cold neutron source\nFRM II, whose design is extremely similar to that of the VCS.
