Whereas quantization of\nthe magnetic flux with hc/2e prevails in sufficiently thick loops with current free interior, the supercurrent in narrow loops is either hc/2e or hc/e periodic with the external magnetic flux. The\nperiodicity depends on the properties of the condensate state, in particular on the Doppler shift\nof the energy spectrum. For an s-wave superconductor in a loop with diameter larger than the\ncoherence length \u03be0 , the Doppler shift is small with respect to the energy gap, and the hc/2e\nperiodic behavior of its flux dependent thermodynamic properties is maintained. However, for\nsmaller s-wave loops and, more prominently, narrow d-wave loops of any diameter R, the Doppler\nshift has a strong effect on the supercurrent carrying state; as a consequence, the fundamental\nflux periodicity is in fact hc/e. It is shown analytically and numerically that the hc/e periodic\ncomponent in the supercurrent decays only algebraically as 1/R for large d-wave loops. For nodal\nsuperconductors the discrete nature of the eigenergies close to the Fermi energy has to be respected\nin the evaluation of the Doppler shift. Furthermore, we investigate, whether the Doppler shift modifies the supercurrent through Josephson junctions with d-wave superconductors. For transparent\njunctions, the Josephson current behaves similar to the persistent supercurrent in a loop. These\ndistinct physical phenomena can be compared, if the magnetic flux \u03a6 = \u03c6 * hc/e is identified with\nthe phase variation of the order parameter \u03b4\u03c6 through 2\u03c0\u03c6 = \u03b4\u03c6/2. Correspondingly, the Josephson current can display a 4\u03c0 periodicity in \u03b4\u03c6, if the Doppler shift is sufficiently strong which is\ntrue for transparent junctions of d-wave superconductors. Moreover, a 4\u03c0 periodicity is also valid\nfor the current-flux relation of field-threaded junctions. In the tunneling regime the microscopic\ntheory reproduces the results of the Ginzburg-Landau description for sufficiently wide Josephson\njunctions.\n\n1\n\n\fI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe quantum mechanical wave function \u03c8 of particles moving in a multiply connected\ngeometry has to be a unique function of the spatial coordinate. This condition leads to a\ndiscrete energy spectrum, because the phase difference of the wave function accumulated\non a closed path has to be 2\u03c0k, where the integer k serves as a quantum number of the\nwave function. For a circular geometry, this phase winding number k represents the angular\nmomentum ~k of the particles.\nIn the presence of a magnetic field B(r) = \u2207 \u00d7 A(r), an additional term adds to the\nRr\nphase of the wave function: \u03c8 \u2032 = \u03c8 exp(\u2212i 2\u03c0(e/hc) r0 dr\u2032 * A(r\u2032 )), where A(r) is the vector\n\npotential, e the charge of the electron, c the velocity of light, h is Planck's constant, and\nr0 an arbitrary space point within the system. The gauge transformed wave function \u03c8 \u2032\nsatisfies the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the vector potential A eliminated from the kinetic\n\nenergy term. The new condition is that \u03c8 \u2032 acquires the phase factor exp(\u2212i2\u03c0(e/hc)\u03a6) for a\nR\npath C enclosing the magnetic flux \u03a6 = C dr * A(r). This leads to a total phase difference of\n\n2\u03c0(k \u2212 e\u03a6/hc) on the closed path C. Because physical quantities are obtained by a thermal\naverage over all possible k, they are periodic in \u03a6 with the fundamental period\n\u03a60 = hc/e,\n\n(1)\n\nwhich is the flux quantum in the normal state. In particular, the persistent current J(\u03a6)\ninduced by the magnetic flux vanishes whenever \u03a6/\u03a60 is an integer.\nThe effect described above is present in any system with sufficient phase coherence, and\nbest known from the periodic resistance modulations of a microscopic metallic loop, predicted first by Ehrenberg and Siday in 19481 and in 1959 by Aharonov and Bohm2 . Already\nten years earlier, London predicted the manifestation of a similar effect in superconducting\nloops, where the phase coherence is naturally macroscopic3 : the magnetic flux threading\nthe loop is quantized in multiples of \u03a60 , because the interior of a superconductor has to be\ncurrent free. London did not know about the existence of \u03a60 /2 flux quanta in superconductors, but he already speculated that the supercurrent might be carried by pairs of electrons\nwith charge 2e and that the superconducting flux quantum and hence the flux periodicity\nof the supercurrent is rather \u03a60 /2. This point of view became generally accepted after the\n'Theory of Superconductivity' by Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS) was published in\n19574 . Direct measurements of magnetic flux quanta \u03a60 /2 trapped in superconducting rings\n2\n\n\fFIG. 1: Scheme of the pairing of angular-momentum eigenstates in a one dimensional metal loop\nfor (a) \u03a6 = 0 and (b) \u03a6 = \u03a60 /2, as used by Schrieffer in12 to illustrate the origin of the \u03a60 /2\nperiodicity in superconductors. Paired are states with equal energy, which leads to pairs with a\ncenter-of-mass angular momentum q = 0 in (a) and q = 1 in (b) in units of ~.\n\nfollowed in 1961 by Doll and N\u00e4bauer5 and by Deaver and Fairbank6 , corroborated later by\nthe detection of \u03a60 /2 flux lines in the vortex phase of type II superconductors7,8 .\nFor thin superconducting loops with walls thinner than the penetration depth \u03bb, finite currents are flowing throughout the entire superconductor. The magnetic flux is consequently\nH\nnot quantized, but London introduced instead the quantity \u03a6\u2032 = \u03a6 + \u039b/c dr * J(r), the\nquantized \"fluxoid\". The flux \u03a6 is the total flux threading the loop, which already includes\n\nthe current induced flux. \u039b is a phenomenological constant parametrizing the strength of\nthe current response of the superconductor to the applied magnetic field; \u039b is related to the\npenetration depth via \u039b = 4\u03c0\u03bb2 /c2 through the London equation3 . Thin superconducting\nloops therefore react periodically to the continuous variable \u03a6.\nIt is tempting to relate the \u03a60 /2 flux periodicity of superconducting loops to the charge\n2e of the Cooper pairs9 which carry the supercurrent, but the pairing of electrons alone is\nnot sufficient to explain the half-integer flux periodicity. A theoretical description of its true\norigin was found independently in 1961 by Byers and Yang10 and by Brenig11 on the basis\nof the BCS theory by realizing that there are two distinct classes of superconducting wave\nfunctions that are not related by a gauge transformation. An intuitive picture illustrating\nthese two types of states is contained in Schrieffer's book on superconductivity12 , using the\nenergy spectrum of a one-dimensional metallic ring: The first class of superconducting wave\nfunctions is related to pairing of electrons with angular momenta k and \u2212k and equal energies\nwithout an applied magnetic field, as schematically shown in Fig. 1 (a). The Cooper pairs\nin this state have a center-of-mass angular momentum q = 0. The wave functions of the\n3\n\n\fFIG. 2: (a) Energy E(\u03a6) and (b) supercurrent J(\u03a6) as a function of flux \u03a6 for a conventional\nsuperconducting loop at T = 0. The minima in E(\u03a6) correspond to superconducting states with\ndifferent pair momenta q. The screening currents in the superconductor drive the system to the\nclosest minimum for each flux value (black points), if the walls of the loop are thicker than \u03bb.\n\nsuperconducting state for all flux values \u03a6, which are integer multiples of \u03a60 and correspond\nto even pair momenta q, are related to the wave function for \u03a6 = 0 by a gauge transformation.\nFor a flux value \u03a60 /2, pairing occurs between degenerate electrons with angular momenta\nk and \u2212k + 1 [Fig. 1 (b)], and leads to a pair momentum q = 1. The corresponding wave\nfunction is again related by a gauge transformation to the states for flux values \u03a6 which are\nhalf-integer multiples of \u03a60 and correspond to odd pair momenta.\nThe two types of pairing states described above are qualitatively different. For the \u03a60 /2\nperiodicity, it is further required that the two types of states are degenerate. Byers and\nYang as well as Brenig showed that this is indeed the case in the thermodynamic limit with\na continuous density of states. The energy E(\u03a6) is then determined by a series of intersecting\nparabolae with minima at integer multiples of \u03a60 (corresponding to even pair momenta q)\nand half integer multiples of \u03a60 (corresponding to odd pair momenta q) [Fig. 2 (a)]. If\nthe loop is thicker than \u03bb, the system locks into the minimum closest to the value of the\nexternal flux. In finite systems however, the degeneracy of the even and odd q minima is\nlifted, but their position is fixed by gauge invariance. The flux periodicity in thin loops\nis thus not necessarily \u03a60 /2, but the superconducting flux quantum remains \u03a60 /2. The\ncirculating supercurrent J(\u03a6) is proportional to \u2202E(\u03a6)/\u2202\u03a6 and forms a \u03a60 /2 periodic sawtooth pattern in the thermodynamic limit as shown in Fig. 2 (b).\n\n4\n\n\fII.\n\nFLUX PERIODICITIES IN CYLINDERS: AN ANALYTIC APPROACH\n\nFor the discussion of the magnetic flux periodicity of d-wave superconductors we choose\nto bend a discrete two-dimensional N \u00d7 M square lattice to a cylinder (Fig. 3) with circumference Na and height Ma. For two reasons we expect nodal superconductors to support a\n\u03a60 = hc/e rather than a \u03a60 /2 periodicity. The first arises from the discrete nature of the\neigenenergies in a finite system. For the thin cylinder shown in Fig. 3 the mean level spacing\nin the vicinity of the Fermi energy EF is \u03b4F \u221d 1/(NM); in s-wave superconductors with an\norder parameter \u2206 \u226b \u03b4F , \u03b4F matters little. For superconducting states with gap nodes, the\n\nsituation is different. In d-wave superconductors with an order parameter \u2206k \u221d k\u03c62 \u2212 kz2 , the\nnodal states closest to EF have to fulfill the condition kz = k\u03c6 , thus there are fewer possible\neigenstates and \u03b4F \u221d 1/N.\nThe second reason is that for gapless superconductors with a finite density of states close\nto EF , the occupation probabilities of these states change with flux. The flux dependence of\nthe occupation enhances the difference of current matrix elements for integer and half-integer\nflux values13\u201316 . This effect is best understood in terms of the spatial extent of a Cooper\npair. In s-wave superconductors, the occupation probability remains constant for all \u03a6, if the\ndiameter of the cylinder is larger than the coherence length \u03be0 . If this condition is fulfilled,\n\nFIG. 3: As a model system we use a thin-wall cylinder constructed from a two-dimensional discrete\nlattice. The interior of the cylinder is threaded by a magnetic flux \u03a6; we assume that the flux does\nnot penetrate into the cylinder wall. \u03a6 can be chosen arbitrarily, since quantization applies to the\nfluxoid and not the flux itself.\n\n5\n\n\fthe constituents of a Cooper pair cannot circulate separately, i.e. the pair does not feel\nthe multiply connected geometry of the cylinder. But for nodal superconducting states, the\nlengthscale which characterizes their coherence, diverges in the nodal directions and there are\nalways Cooper pairs which extend around the circumference of the cylinder. Therefore nodal\nsuperconductors have no characteristic length scale above which the superconducting state\nis unaffected by the geometry of the system. These two combined effects are investigated\non the basis of an analytic model in Sec. II B.\n\nA.\n\nSuperconductivity in a flux-threaded cylinder\n\nThe properties of a finite-size multiply connected superconductor depend sensitively on\nthe discrete energy spectrum in the normal state. On the N \u00d7 M square lattice, the flux\nvalues where levels cross have a high degeneracy for special ratios N/M; for N = M, the\ndegree of degeneracy is M. For the latter case, the differences between the spectrum for\ninteger and half-integer flux values are most pronounced. For N = M \u00b1 1, the spectrum is\nalmost \u03a60 /2-periodic. Away from these special choices of N and M, the degeneracies are\nlifted, indicated by the blue shaded patches in Fig. 4. The size of the normal persistent\ncurrent circulating around the cylinder is controlled by the change of the density of states\nnear EF upon increasing \u03c6 = \u03a6/\u03a60 . Since normal persistent currents in clean metallic\nrings are typically \u03a60 periodic2,17 , we will choose N = M and a half-filled system with the\nchemical potential \u03bc = 0 for our model study, where the \u03a60 periodicity of the spectrum\nis most clearly established. Whenever an energy level crosses EF with increasing flux, the\ncurrent reverses its sign. The current is \u03a60 -periodic for even N and either paramagnetic\nor diamagnetic in the vicinity of \u03c6 = 0. For odd N, the current is \u03a60 /2-periodic. This\nlattice-size dependence persists also in rings with electron-electron interactions18\u201320 or in\nmesoscopic superconducting islands21 .\nWe choose in the following N and M even, which leads to a normal state spectrum of the\ntype shown in Fig. 4. This is not an obvious choice, but we will see in chapter 3 that one\nobtains this type of spectrum also for a square loop to which we will compare the results\nobtained for the cylinder geometry.\nThe starting point for our analysiss is the BCS theory for a flux threaded cylinder with\ncircumference Na = 2\u03c0Ra and height Ma, where R is the dimensionless radius of the\n6\n\n\fFIG. 4: The energy spectrum of a cylinder in the normal state depends on the numbers N and M ,\nwhich parametrize the circumference and the height of the cylinder39 .

The open boundary conditions in the z-direction along the axis of the cylinder allow for even-parity solutions with kz = (2me \u2212 1)\u03c0/M and odd-parity solutions with kz = 2\u03c0mo /M, where\n\nme , mo \u2208 {1, . . . , M/2}. The operators c\u2020ks and cks create and annihilate electrons with angular momentum ~k\u03c6 /a and momentum ~kz /a in z direction. For convenience, we choose k\u03c6 ,\nkz \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0].

Here we choose a d-wave interaction in separable\nform: V (k, k\u2032 , q) = V1 g(k \u2212 q/2)g(k\u2032 \u2212 q/2) with g(k) = cos(k\u03c6 ) \u2212 cos(kz ); V1 is the\n\npairing interaction strength22 . The order parameter \u2206(k, q) represents spin-singlet Cooper\npairs with pair momentum ~q/a. On the cylinder, the coherent motion of the Cooper\npairs is possible only in the azimuthal direction, therefore q = (q/R, 0) with q \u2208 {\u2212N/2 +\n1, . . . , N/2}. The quantum number q is obtained from minimizing the free energy. The\n\u03c6-dependence of \u2206q (\u03c6) enters through the self-consistency condition and has been discussed\nextensively in23 and14 for s-wave pairing, where g(k) \u2261 const. As verified numerically, \u2206q (\u03c6)\nvaries only little with \u03c6, and we start our analytic calculation with a \u03c6 and q independent\norder parameter \u2206(k, q) \u2261 \u2206(k) and \u2206q (\u03c6) \u2261 \u2206. As in our preceding work14 , we take q =\nfloor(2\u03c6 + 1/2) in a first step. Since the Hamiltonian (2) is invariant under the simultaneous\ntransformation \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 \u00b1 1 and q \u2192 q \u00b1 2, it is sufficient to consider q = 0 or 1 and the\ncorresponding flux sectors \u22121/4 \u2264 \u03c6 < 1/4 and 1/4 \u2264 \u03c6 < 3/4, respectively.\nThe diagonalization of the Hamiltonian (2) leads to the quasiparticle dispersion\nE\u00b1 (k, q, \u03c6) =\n\n\u01ebk (\u03c6) \u2212 \u01eb\u2212k+q (\u03c6) p 2\n\u00b1 \u2206 (k) + \u01eb2 (k, q, \u03c6),\n2\n\n(6)\n\nwith \u01eb(k, q, \u03c6) = [\u01ebk (\u03c6) + \u01eb\u2212k+q (\u03c6)]/2. Expanding E\u00b1 (k, q, \u03c6) to linear order in both \u03c6/R\nand q/R gives\nE\u00b1 (k, q, \u03c6) \u2248 \u2212eq (k) \u00b1\nwhere\neq (k) =\n\nq\n\n\u03c6 \u2212 q/2\n2t sin k\u03c6\nR\n\n\u22062 (k) + [\u01ebk (0) \u2212 lq (k)]2 ,\nand\n\nlq (k) =\n\ntq\nsin k\u03c6 .\nR\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nIn the normal state \u2206 = 0, the additive combination of eq (k) and lq (k) leads to the qindependent dispersion (3). For \u2206 > 0, the dispersion (7) differs for even and odd q,\nexcept for special ratios of N and M, as discussed above. This difference is crucial for\nnodal superconductors: The condition k\u03c6 \u2248 kz for levels close to EF causes a level spacing\n\u03b4F \u2248 2l1 (kF ) for small \u2206, where kF is the Fermi momentum. For N and M even and q = 0,\nthe degenerate energy level at E = EF = 0 splits into M levels for increasing \u2206, which\nspread between \u2212\u2206 and \u2206. For q = 1, the degenerate levels closest to EF are located at\nE = \u00b1|l1 (kF )|, thus a gap of 2l1 (kF ) remains in the superconducting spectrum. If N and\nM are odd, the spectra for even and odd q are interchanged, and if either N or M is odd,\nthe spectrum is a superposition.\n8\n\n\fThe gauge invariant circulating supercurrent is given by\nJ(\u03c6) =\n\neX\nvk ns (k),\nh k,s\n\n(9)\n\nwhere vk = \u2202\u01ebk (\u03c6)/\u2202(Rk\u03c6 ) is the group velocity of the single-particle state with eigenenergy\n\u01ebk (\u03c6). The spin independent occupation probability of this state is\nns (k) = hc\u2020ks cks i = u2 (k, q, \u03c6)f (E+ (k, q, \u03c6)) + v 2 (k, q, \u03c6)f (E\u2212 (k, q, \u03c6))\nwith the Fermi function f (E) and the Bogoliubov amplitudes\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015\n1 \u01eb(k, q, \u03c6)\n1 \u01eb(k, q, \u03c6)\n2\n2\nu (k, q, \u03c6) =\n+1\nand\nv (k, q, \u03c6) =\n\u22121 .\n2 E(k, q, \u03c6)\n2 E(k, q, \u03c6)\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nFrom Eqs. (9) and (10), the supercurrent in the cylinder is obtained by evaluating the sum\neither numerically or from the approximative analytic solution in Sec. II B, which allows\ninsight into the origin of the \u03a60 -periodicity in nodal superconductors. First, the analytic\nsolution, which was introduced in Ref.39 , is reviewed.\n\nB.\n\nAnalytic solution and qualitative discussion\n\nAn analytic evaluation of the supercurrent is possible in the thermodynamic limit where\nthe sum over discrete eigenstates is replaced by an integral. For a multiply connected\ngeometry, this limit is not properly defined because the supercurrent or the Doppler shift\nvanish in the limit R \u2192 \u221e. Care is needed to modify the limiting procedure in a suitable\n\nway to access the limit of a large but non-infinite radius of the cylinder39 . In this limit it is\nmandatory to consider the supercurrent density j(\u03c6) = J(\u03c6)/M rather than the supercurrent\nJ(\u03c6). In this scheme, we treat the density of states as a continuous function in any energy\nrange where the level spacing is \u221d 1/NM, but we keep the finite energy gap of width\n2lq (kF ) \u221d 1/R \u221d 1/N around EF in the odd-q sectors. For the tight-binding dispersion\nin Eq. (3), the density of states is a complete elliptic integral of the first kind. For the\npurpose of an analytic calculation, a quadratic dispersion with a constant density of states\nis therefore a more suitable starting point. We use the expanded form of Eq. (3):\n#\n\"\u0012\n\u00132\n\u03c6\n2\n+ kz \u2212 \u03bc\u2032 ,\n\u01ebk (\u03c6) = t k\u03c6 \u2212\nR\nwhere \u03bc\u2032 = \u03bc + 4t.\n9\n\n(12)\n\n\fSome algebraic steps are needed to rearrange the sum in Eq. (9) suitably to convert it into\nan integral. For finite \u03c6, \u01ebk (\u03c6) 6= \u01eb\u2212k (\u03c6), and consequently the sum has to be decomposed\ninto contributions with k\u03c6 \u2265 0 and k\u03c6 < 0. We therefore take k\u03c6 \u2265 0 and decompose vk as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2t\n\u03c6\nv\u00b1k =\n\u00b1k\u03c6 \u2212\n= vd (k) \u00b1 vp (k),\n(13)\nR\nR\ninto a diamagnetic contribution vd (k) = \u22122t\u03c6/R2 and a paramagnetic contribution vp (k) =\n\n2tk\u03c6 /R24 .\n\nIn a continuous energy integration, the Doppler shift is noticeable only in the vicinity of\nEF . On the Fermi surface k\u03c6 and kz are related by\nr\n\u03bc\u2032\nk\u03c6,F (kz ) =\n\u2212 kz2 .\nt\n\n(14)\n\nWe therefore approximate eq (k) and lq (k) by eq (kz ) \u2248 2t(\u03c6 \u2212 q/2)k\u03c6,F (kz )/R and lq (kz ) \u2248\ntqk\u03c6,F (kz )/R, respectively. The eigenenergies (7) near EF are thereby rewritten as\nq\nE+ (\u00b1k\u03c6 , kz , q, \u03c6) = \u2213eq (kz ) + \u22062k + (\u01ebk (0) \u2213 lq (kz ))2\nq\nE\u2212 (\u00b1k\u03c6 , kz , q, \u03c6) = \u2213eq (kz ) \u2212 \u22062k + (\u01ebk (0) \u2213 lq (kz ))2\n\n(15)\n\nThe supercurrent J(\u03c6) in Eq. (9) is now evaluated by an integral over k\u03c6 and kz , which is\n\ndecomposed into an integral over the normal state energy \u01eb and an angular variable \u03b8. Within\nthis scheme the density of states becomes gapless in the limit M \u2192 \u221e for q = 0, although\nN is kept finite. For q = 1 instead, a kz -dependent gap 2|l1 (kz )| remains. Thus we replace\n\u01ebk (0) \u2213 |lq (kz )| by the continuous quantity \u01eb \u00b1 |lq (EF , \u03b8)| where we use the parametrization\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6 r\n\u2032\ncos \u03b8\nk\nk cos \u03b8\n\uf8f8,\n\uf8ed \u03c6\uf8f8=\uf8ed\n\uf8f8= \u01eb+\u03bc \uf8ed\n(16)\nt\nsin \u03b8\nkz\nk sin \u03b8\n\nwith \u01eb = tk 2 \u2212 \u03bc\u2032 . The energy integral extends over the whole tight-binding band width\n\nwith EF = 0 in the center of the band. Correspondingly, we integrate from \u2212\u03bc\u2032 to \u03bc\u2032 .\nFurthermore, the Doppler shift is parametrized for \u01eb \u2248 EF as\ntq p \u2032\n\u03c6 \u2212 q/2 p \u2032\n2t \u03bc /t cos \u03b8\nand\nlq (\u03b8) =\n\u03bc /t cos \u03b8,\neq (\u03b8) =\nR\nR\n\nwhere the function lq (\u03b8) is positive for |\u03b8| \u2264 \u03c0/2. The supercurrent thus becomes\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nX\nX\n1 e\uf8f0\nvk nks (q) +\nvk nks (q)\uf8fb\nj(\u03c6) =\nM h k >0,k ,s\nk\u03c6 <0,kz ,s\n\u03c6\nz\nZ \u03c0/2 Z \u03bc\u2032\ne\n\u2248 2N\nd\u03b8\nd\u01eb[nq+ (\u01eb, \u03b8)v+ (\u01eb, \u03b8) + nq\u2212 (\u01eb, \u03b8)v\u2212 (\u01eb, \u03b8)],\nh \u2212\u03c0/2\n\u2212\u03bc\u2032\n10\n\n(17)\n\n(18)\n\n\fwhere nq\u00b1 (\u01eb, \u03b8) = n\u00b1k(\u01eb,\u03b8) (q) and v\u00b1 (\u01eb, \u03b8) = v\u00b1k(\u01eb,\u03b8) . The constant density of states in the\nnormal state is N = R/4\u03c0t. We collect the terms proportional to vd (\u01eb, \u03b8) = \u22122t\u03c6/R2 into a\ndiamagnetic current contribution jd and those proportional to vp (\u01eb, \u03b8) = 2tk\u03c6,F (\u01eb, \u03b8)/R into\na paramagnetic contribution jp .

In Eq. (19) we used the abbreviations \u2206 = \u2206(\u03b8) and E = E(\u01eb, \u03b8) =\np\n\u22062 (\u03b8) + \u01eb2 . The current jd is diamagnetic in the even-q flux sectors and paramagnetic\n\nin the odd-q sectors. For even q, it is equivalent to the diamagnetic current obtained from\nthe London equations25,26 . The current jp has always the reverse sign of jd and is related\nto the quasiparticle current as shown below. To analyze the flux dependent properties of\nthe spectra and the current in the even-q and odd-q sectors, we explicitly distinguish s-wave\npairing and d-wave pairing with nodes in the gap function.\n\n1.\n\ns-wave pairing symmetry\n\nFor s-wave pairing, \u2206(\u01eb, \u03b8) \u2261 \u2206 is constant. Therefore, if we assume that \u2206 \u2265 eq (\u03b8) for\nall \u03b8, the lower energy integration boundary in Eqs. (19) and (20) is \u2206. Thus j(\u03c6) = jd +jp is\nequal in both the even-q and the odd-q flux sectors and the flux periodicity is \u03a60 /2. However,\nif \u2206 < max\u03b8 eq (\u03b8), different calculational steps have to be followed in the evaluation of\nEq. (9), the results of which have been presented in14 .\n\u221a\nWith \u01eb = E 2 \u2212 \u22062 , Eqs.

The current jp increases with increasing T and reaches its\nmaximum value at Tc . For finite temperatures jp is referred to as the quasiparticle current.\nThe supercurrent is always the sum of the diamagnetic current jd and the quasiparticle\ncurrent jp , and therefore decreases with increasing temperature and vanishes at Tc 27 .

Physically, jd reflects the difference in the density of states of quasiparticle states with orbital\nmagnetic moments parallel and anti-parallel to the external magnetic field. The former\nstates are Doppler shifted to lower energies, whereas the latter are Doppler shifted to higher\nenergies. This is schematically shown in Fig. 5 for d-wave pairing (c.f.28 ). In this picture,\njd is proportional to the difference between the area beneath the red and and blue curves\nrepresenting the density of states arising from E\u2212 (\u00b1|k|, q, \u03c6) < 0. Therefore we approximate\n12\n\n\fFIG. 5: Scheme for the density of states of a d-wave superconductor for \u03c6 = 1/4, where eq = l1 /239 .\nThe center-of-mass angular momentum ~q/aR of the Cooper pairs is (a) q = 0 and (b) q = 1. The\nenergies are Doppler shifted to higher (red) or lower energies (blue). This results in a double-peak\nstructure; for q = 0 the upper and lower band overlap in the region \u2212e0 < E < e0 28 and states in\nthe upper band become partially occupied. For q = 1 there is a gap l1 of the size of the maximum\nDoppler shift at \u03c6 = 1/4.

On the other hand, jp is represented by the occupied\nquasiparticle states in the overlap region of E+ (k, q, \u03c6) and E\u2212 (k, q, \u03c6) with width 2eq (kF ).\nIt therefore strongly depends on the density of states in the vicinity of EF . In Fig. 5 (a),\nwhich refers to even q, the current jp is determined by the small triangular patch where the\nupper and lower bands overlap. For odd q, the two bands do not overlap, therefore jp = 0.\nWe will now analyze such a scenario for d-wave pairing with an order parameter \u2206k =\n\u2206(k\u03c62 \u2212 kz2 ) \u2248 \u2206 cos 2\u03b8.

This 1/R-law is the direct consequence of the\nd-wave density of states Dd (E) \u221d E. Using Eq.

This\ncurrent is generated by the flux-induced reoccupation of nodal quasiparticle states slightly\nbelow and above EF . Formally a coherence length ~vF /\u2206(k, q) > 2R can be ascribed to\nthese reoccupied states, which are therefore affected by the symmetry of the system. If\nthe normal state energy spectrum has a flux periodicity of \u03a60 , than the superconducting\nspectrum is \u03a60 periodic, too. The normal state spectrum of a cylinder with a discrete lattice\nstrongly depends on the number of lattice sites. This problem is characteristic for rotationally\nsymmetric systems and is much less pronounced in geometries with lower symmetry, such\nas the square frame discussed in Sec. 3. In the latter system impurities do not change the\nspectrum qualitatively. For modelling an experimental arrangement a square loop geometry\nis therefore preferable.\nThe \u03a60 periodicity is best visible in the current component jp at T = 0. For d-wavepairing jp \u221d 1/R2 , and the \u03a60 periodic Fourier component decays like the inverse radius of\nthe cylinder, relative to the \u03a60 /2 periodic Fourier component. The lack of a characteristic\nlength scale in nodal superconductors, such as the coherence length for s-wave pairing,\ngenerates this algebraic decay. Although jp is larger for small \u2206, it almost vanishes close to\n15\n\n\fTc , if \u2206 \u226b \u03b4F , and variations of Tc with flux, as in the Little-Parks experiment29,30 , do not\ndiffer for s- and d-wave superconductors.\n\nIII.\n\nFLUX PERIODICITY IN SQUARE FRAMES: BOGOLIUBOV \u2013 DE GENNES\n\nAPPROACH\n\nSo far we have presented the principles of the crossover from \u03a60 to \u03a60 /2 flux periodicity\nin conventional and unconventional superconductors and the mechanisms that leads to the\npersistence of \u03a60 periodicity in large loops of nodal superconductors. Now we present an\nalternative approach in real space via the Bogoliubov \u2013 de Gennes equations, which we\nintroduce in Sec. III A. The information we obtain from this technique is complementary\nto Sec. II where we followed the momentum-space formulation. The latter proved useful\nto understand the physical concepts and to describe large systems. The price paid was\nthe restriction to highly symmetric systems with intriguing energy spectra in the normal\nstate. This raises the question whether the \u03a60 periodicity is detectable in realistic setups,\nor whether it is rather an artifact of the high degeneracy of energy levels in clean and highly\nsymmetric systems? On the other hand, the Bogoliubov \u2013 de Gennes equations in real space\nallow to determine the spectrum of \"natural\" system geometries with reduced symmetry or\nsystems containing lattice defects, impurities, magnetic fields or correlations in real space.\nLimitations of computational power, however, restrict the system size, and therefore the\nparticular effects introduced by discreteness are unavoidably present.\nThe combination of momentum- and real-space methods can provide answers to the\nquestions above. In the following, we first discuss the multi-channel loop for a square\nlattice: a square frame, as shown in Fig. 7, with a square hole at the center, threaded by\na magnetic flux \u03a6. We use this system in Sec. III B to study the flux periodicity in clean\nsymmetric square frames; a part of this section is contained in13 . In Sec. IV, we investigate\ndifferent Josephson junction devices that respond periodically to magnetic fields. Junctions\nare modeled in real space by inserting potential barriers. In this context, we investigate also\nthe effect of impurities and lattice defects on the energy spectrum of the square frame.\n\n16\n\n\fA.\n\nThe Bogoliubov \u2013 de Gennes equations\n\nThe Hamiltonian which we use in the following section has the form\ni X\ni Xh\nX\nXh\n\u2206\u2217ji cj\u2193 ci\u2191 + \u2206ij c\u2020i\u2191 c\u2020j\u2193 + (Ui \u2212 \u03bc)c\u2020is cis ,\nH=\ntij c\u2020is cjs +\n\u2206\u2217i ci\u2193 ci\u2191 + \u2206i c\u2020i\u2191 c\u2020i\u2193 +\ni\n\nhiji,s\n\ni,s\n\nhiji\n\n(36)\n\nwhere c\u2020is , cis are creation and annihilation operators for an electron on lattice site i with\nP\nspin s, and \u03bc is the chemical potential.

A Hamiltonian of the form (36)\nhas often been used before for the numeric investigation of vortices in d-wave superconductors\nand the technique is described in detail in a number of articles31\u201336 .\nIn the Hamiltonian Eq. (36) two types of spin-singlet pairing are included. The onsite order parameter \u2206i represents conventional s-wave pairing originating from an on-site\ninteraction. The order parameter \u2206ij originates from a nearest-neighbor interaction between\nthe sites i and j. They are defined through\n\u2206i = V0 hci\u2193 ci\u2191 i and \u2206ij =\n\nV1\n[hcj\u2193 ci\u2191 i \u2212 hci\u2193 cj\u2191i] .\n2\n\n(38)\n\nwith the interaction strengths V0 and V1 .

The external magnetic field B\nthreading the hole is supposed not to penetrate into the frame, and we restrict it to the center\nof the hole. B is generated by a vector potential of the form A(r) = 2\u03c0\u03c6/|r|2(y, \u2212x, 0).\nIn the normal state the Bogoliubov \u2013 de Gennes equations reduce to the discrete Laplace\nequation. While the low-energy states do not differ much from free plane waves, the higherenergy states near EF on the square frame develop some peculiar, frame-specific features.\nThe wavelength of a state near EF is close to two lattice constants, therefore the probability\ndensity divides into two sublattices. In the square frame, structures on different sublattices\ncan overlap, which results in the characteristic real-space density profiles which persist in\nthe nodal states of a d-wave superconductor. Figure 8 shows two such examples.\n\n18\n\n\fFIG. 7: Illustration of a square loop threaded by a magnetic flux. For the investigation of the flux\nperiodicity of d-wave superconductors using the Bogoliubov \u2013 de Gennes equations in real space,\nwe use a discrete square lattice with open boundary conditions and a square hole in the center the\nframe, which is pierced by the magnetic flux \u03a6.\n\nThe characterization of the superconducting solutions of the Bogoliubov \u2013 de Gennes\nequations in the square frame is analogous to those on the cylinder in the momentum space\nanalysis. The absolute value of the d-wave order parameter |\u2206di | is shown in Fig. 9 (a) for\n\u03c6 = 0. The open boundary conditions cause a decrease on the boundaries and are responsible for Friedel oscillations visible along the diagonal. In multiply connected geometries,\nthe Bogoliubov \u2013 de Gennes equations generally allow for solutions where \u2206di acquires a\nphase gradient such that the phase difference on a closed path around the hole is 2\u03c0q with\ninteger q. As in Secs. I and II, this phase winding number q represents the center-of-mass\nmotion of a Cooper pair, although it cannot be identified with the angular momentum in the\nsquare geometry. The different numerical solutions are obtained by choosing appropriate\ninitial values for the phase of \u2206di , and the phases of the self-consistent results are shown in\nFigs. 9 (b), (c) and (d) for q = 1, 2 and 3 and flux values \u03c6 = 1/2, 1 and 3/2, respectively.\nTo assess the E(\u03c6) and the current J(\u03c6), the evolution of the eigenenergies with magnetic\nflux has to be calculated first. The eigenstates with energies below EF form the ground-state\ncondensate (Fig. 10). Here we discuss only flux values \u03c6 between 0 and 1/2, because all\nquantities are either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to flux reversal \u03c6 \u2192 \u2212\u03c6. The\nspectrum for a square frame with N = 40 and L = 14 is shown in Fig. 10 for half filling, i.e.,\n\u03bc = 0. Because the number of lattice sites on straight paths around the hole is a multiple\n\n19\n\n\fof four in a square frame, the spectrum is almost identical to the one for a cylinder with an\neven number of lattice sites and with the same number N \u2212 L = 26 of transverse channels\n\n(compare to Fig. 6 in Ref.39 ). For the square frame, the energy levels do not actually cross\nEF , because the lack of rotational symmetry leads to hybridization of the levels and level\nrepulsion. Nevertheless, the same clearly distinct flux regimes are found: the flux intervals\nbetween 0 and 1/4 and from 1/4 to 1/2 (in units of \u03a60 ).\nUp to \u03c6 \u2243 1/4 the current J(\u03c6) generates a magnetic field which tends to reduce the\napplied field by a continuous shift of the eigenenergies in the condensate. At \u03c6 = 0, pairs of\nstates with opposite circulation compensate their respective currents, thus J = 0. The well\nseparated states at \u03c6 = 0 in Fig. 10 are the states in the vicinity of the nodes of the d-wave\nsuperconductor. Away from EF , the density of states increases towards the states near the\nmaximum energy gap \u2206 that provide most of the condensation energy. For \u03c6 > 0, the\nenergy of the states with orbital magnetic moment anti-parallel (parallel) to the magnetic\nfield is increased (decreased). Correspondingly the supercurrent, which is carried by these\nstates, depends on the details of level crossings and avoidings. The main contribution to the\nsupercurrent arises from the occupied levels closest to EF , because the contributions from\n\nFIG. 8: Real-space representations of a square loop with a typical electronic probability density\n|\u03a8|2 . We show two eigenstates of the d-wave pairing Hamiltonian with slightly different energies\nin the gap region, calculated for a square-loop with 80\u00d780 lattice sites and a pairing interaction\nV1 = 0.3t. The hole in the center has a size of 28\u00d728 unit cells. To enhance the contrast of the\ncomplicated pattern, the special color code shown on the right is used and the discrete lattice\npoints are smoothly interpolated.\n\n20\n\n\fFIG. 9: (a) Absolute value of the d-wave order parameter \u2206di (in units of t) in a 40 \u00d7 40 square\nframe with a 14 \u00d7 14 hole at the center for q = 0, \u03c6 = 0, and V1 = 0.3t. For this interaction\nstrength, the suppression of \u2206di for \u03c6 6= 0 is small and not visible in this plot. The phase of \u2206di is\nshown for winding numbers q = 1, 2, 3 in (b), (c) and (d), respectively.\n\nthe lower-lying states tend to cancel in adjacent pairs.\nAs the highest occupied state shifts with increasing flux to lower energies, the current in\nthe square loop first increases for small \u03c6 (Fig. 11), then decreases when the highest occupied\nlevel with an orbital moment opposite to the applied magnetic field starts to dominate. With\nincreasing flux this state approaches EF . A current-carrying state in the vicinity of the nodes\nis replaced upon a slight increase of \u03c6 by a state of opposite current direction. The states of\nthe condensate are thereby continuously changing near the extrapolated crossing points. As\na consequence, the energy \"parabola\" centered at zero flux is different from the ground-state\nenergy parabola centered at \u03c6 = 1/2 [Fig. 11 (a)]. The deviation from a parabolic shape\nnear zero flux is due to the evolution of the near-nodal states; the vertical offset of the energy\nminima at \u03c6 = n results mostly from the flux dependence of the states near the maximum\nvalue of the anisotropic gap.\n21\n\n\fFIG. 10: Energy spectrum for a d-wave superconductor on a square frame. The eigenenergies in\nthe gap region are shown for a square 40\u00d740 loop with a 14\u00d714 hole and pair interaction V1 = 0.3t\nas a function of flux \u03c6 (in units of \u03a60 ). The energies are given in units of the superconducting\norder parameter \u2206 at \u03c6 = 0 (\u2206 \u2248 0.22t). The superconducting condensate consists of the states\nbelow EF = 0. Reconstruction of the condensate takes place near \u03c6 = \u00b1(n + 1)/2, where the\neigenenergies jump abruptly (after Ref.13 .\n\nFor flux values near \u03c6 = 1/4 the condensate reconstructs. The superconducting state\nbeyond 1/4 belongs to the class of wave functions introduced by Byers and Yang10 in which,\nfor a circular geometry, each pair acquires a center-of-mass angular momentum ~12 . Remarkably, in the flux interval from near 1/4 to 1/2, a full energy gap exists also for d-wave\nsuperconductors (Fig. 10). Here the circulating current enhances the magnetic field; the\nparamagnetic orbital moment of the current is parallel to the field. The resulting energy\ngain is responsible for the field-induced energy gap. This reconstruction of the condensate\nis the origin of the \u03a60 periodicity in energy and current.\nThese calculations show that a d-wave superconducting loop in a square geometry has\nalmost identical properties to a flux threaded cylinder. This is remarkable, because on a\nclosed path in the square frame, the phase of the d-wave order parameter \u2206di rotates by\n2\u03c0, whereas in the cylinder, the order parameter rotates with the lattice. Therefore, while\nchanges in the geometry and the number of transverse channels modify the spectrum and\nthe J(\u03c6) characteristics in detail, they do not eliminate the \u03a60 periodic component. The\nreduction of the symmetry, here to the four-fold rotational symmetry of the square frame,\nstabilizes the spectrum compared to the cylinder geometry.\n\n22\n\n\fFIG. 11: Flux dependence of energy and current for the square frame.

J(\u03c6) is given in units of t/\u03a60 = 6 \u00d7 10\u22125 A for the choice of t = 250 meV. The\ncondensate states with even and odd winding number q are clearly distinct, which is reflected, e.g.,\nin the deformation of the q = 0-parabola. The overall \u03c6 periodicity for E(\u03c6) and J(\u03c6) is \u03a60 (from\nRef.13 ).\nIV.\n\nFLUX PERIODICITY OF JOSEPHSON JUNCTIONS\n\nAll energy levels are Doppler shifted in current carrying systems, not only in flux threaded\nloops but also in wires or at the surface of bulk superconductors. In the latter systems, the\nphase gradient of the superconducting order parameter typically does not reach the value necessary to drive the superconductor into a finite-momentum pairing state with q 6= 0, which is\nwhy the influence of finite momentum pairing on the flux periodicity has not been discussed\nin the literature until recently. An exception are systems with strong inhomogeneities of the\norder parameter, which act as Josephon junctions. The phase gradient accumulates at the\njunctions and they behave periodically with the phase gradient, as described by the Josephson relation. From what has been discussed for the flux periodicity in multiply connected\ngeometries, it appears natural that the Doppler shift of nodal states might also influence\nthe periodicity of Josephson junctions.\nA Josephson junction is intrinsically a more complicated system than a superconducting\nloop. Several parameters are needed to characterize the junction as well as the superconducting states on each side of the junction. Most junctions can be classified either as transparent\nor as tunnel junctions, regardless whether they consist of a geometrical constriction, a potential barrier, or a normal metal bridge. This classification is closely related to the Doppler\nshift of single energy levels in the system, as will be explained below. In the following we will\n23\n\n\ftherefore discuss the Josephson relations in both the tunneling and the transparent regimes.\n\nA.\n\nCurrent-phase relation\n\nThe current-phase relation, which expresses the supercurrent J over a Josephson junction\nas a function of the phase difference \u03b4\u03c6 of the order parameters on both sides of the junction\nis:\nJ = Jc sin(\u03b4\u03c6).\n\n(46)\n\nJc is the critical current over the junction, above which the zero voltage state breaks down.\nThis relation was predicted by Josephson in 196240 and can be directly derived from a\nGinzburg-Landau description26 . For transparent junctions, sin(\u03b4\u03c6) in Eq. (46) distorts into a\nsaw-tooth pattern similar to the current-flux relation in superconducting loops41 . It is crucial\nto realize that the phase gradient of the order parameter is twice that of the superconducting\nwave function. If the phase difference of the order parameter on both sides of the junction\nis \u03b4\u03c6, then the phase difference of the wave function is \u03b4\u03c6/2. Because the wave function\nof the system has to be 2\u03c0-periodic, the periodicity of the energy spectrum and the order\nparameter of a finite system is 4\u03c0. The current contributions from all energy levels add up\nto a 2\u03c0 periodic supercurrent only in the thermodynamic limit. In this section we analyze\nwhether the Doppler shift of the energy levels leads to the same doubling of the periodicity\nin \u03b4\u03c6 of a junction as it does for the flux periodicity of loops. While for the tunneling regime\nwe rely on a simple linear-junction model, we will analyze transparent junctions by inserting\na Josephson junction into a square frame. This has the advantage of a remarkable stability\nof the energy spectrum against the insertion of impurities and lattice defects, as will be seen\nin Sec. IV A 2.\n\n1.\n\nTunnel junctions\n\nA simple model of a tunnel junction is a square lattice with N sites in x-direction and\nM sites and periodic boundary conditions in y-direction. The junction is modeled in the\ntunneling regime by one or two lines of potential scatterers with a repulsive potential U > 4t\n(Fig. 12). In the absence of a magnetic field, this system is homogeneous in y-direction, and\nthe Fourier transformation with respect to the y-coordinate will allow the diagonalization\n24\n\n\fFIG. 12: To model a Josephson junction we choose a discrete square lattice with N sites in\nx-direction, and M sites in y-direction. The junction itself is modeled by one or two lines of\npotential scatterers (black points) each with a repulsive potential U > 0.\n\nof larger systems43 .\nThe Bogoliubov \u2013 de Gennes equations are slightly modified in this case: the eigenvalue\nequation (40) for nearest-neighbor interaction is now defined through the relations\nt\u0302unix ky =\n\nX\n\n\u02c6 n\n=\ntij unjx ky + (\u01ebky + Uix )unix ky , \u2206v\nix ky\n\nX\n\n\u2206ij vnjx ,ky + \u2206ky vnix ky ,\n\n(47)\n\njx\n\njx\n\nwhere \u01ebky = \u22122t cos(ky )\u2212\u03bc and \u2206ky = \u2206y cos(ky ).

The sin(\u03b4\u03c6) relation is considerably deformed,\nwhich is typical for narrow junctions with very few channels. Right panel: N = 20, M = 200,\nV1 = t, and U = 5t. This junction has a sufficiently many channels to exhibit the known currentphase relation. The overall sign depends on the choice of the sign in the phase factor of the hopping\nmatrix elements.\n\n25\n\n\fself-consistency equations are\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni\nEn (ky )\nV1 X h\n\u2217\n\u2217\nunix ky vnjx ky + unjx ky vnix ky tanh\n,\n\u2206ij =\n2 n,k\n2kB T\n\n(48)\n\ny\n\nif j = i \u00b1 x\u0302, and if the bonds are along the y direction\n\u2206y = V1\n\nX\n\nunix ky vn\u2217 ix ky\n\ncos(ky ) tanh\n\nn,ky\n\n\u0012\n\nEn (ky )\n2kB T\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(49)\n\nThe self-consistency equation for the s-wave order parameter \u2206i with on-site interaction is\nanalogous to (49), but without the factor cos(ky ).\nTo induce a finite phase gradient of the order parameter and a supercurrent, we introduce\na \"phase jump\" \u03b4\u03c6 in the matrix elements tij for hopping from ix = N \u2212 1 back to ix = 0,\nand a jump \u2212\u03b4\u03c6 for the corresponding hopping in the opposite direction. An alternative,\n\nbut physically equivalent choice for the phase of tij is a constant phase factor ei\u03c6ij with\n\u03c6ij = \u03b4\u03c6/N for all hopping processes along the x-direction, which is mathematically identical\nto a cylinder threaded by a flux \u03a6 = (hc/e) \u03c6 with 2\u03c0\u03c6 = \u03b4\u03c6/2. In the fully transparent case\nwith U = 0, this leads to a homogeneous phase gradient of \u2206di = (\u2206i,i+x\u0302 + \u2206i,i\u2212x\u0302 )/2 + \u2206y\n\n(or \u2206i , respectively), whereas far in the tunneling regime for U > 4t, the phase of the order\nparameter drops only across the junction. The current across the junction is calculated as in\nEq. (45). The results for two typical situations are shown in Fig. 13. The left panel displays\nthe current-phase relation of a narrow Josephson junction with a width of M = 12 sites. The\nusual current-phase relation is considerably deformed in this case, as is typical for junctions\nwith very few channels41 . The exact form of the current-phase relation is characteristic for\neach junction; it depends on the structure of the energy spectrum, which changes strongly\nupon increasing or decreasing the system size or adding impurities. For increasing M, the\ncurrent-phase relation approaches (46), as the level spacing becomes negligible. This is the\nregime of wide junctions, shown in Fig. 13 (right panel), which is well described by the\nGinzburg-Landau approach.\nOur numerical analysis shows that the Josephson relation (46) describes wide junctions\nin the tunneling regime very well; a doubling of the period is not observed, even for dwave superconductors with small antinodal energy gap. The reason for this is twofold: (1)\nAlong with the suppression of the critical current Jc across the junction, the Doppler shift\ndecreases strongly with increasing repulsive potential U. In the tunneling regime (U > 4t),\nJc decreases by a factor > 103 . Consequently no energy levels (or negligibly few in very\n26\n\n\fFIG. 14: The top 14 energy levels below EF calculated for a linear Josephson juntion with N = 18,\nM = 12 and V1 = 0.6t as a function of the repulsive potential U on the junction.\n\nlarge systems) approach EF as a function of \u03b4\u03c6 and the effects related to a reversal of single\nparticle currents are absent. (2) For tunnel junctions, the thermodynamic Ginzburg-Landau\nlimit is reached also for d-wave superconductors, if the density of states close to EF becomes\nquasi-continuous, in contrast to the flux threaded loop. The deformation of the currentphase relation in narrow tunnel junctions is generically not due to levels reaching EF . The\ndeformation is induced, if the total current is carried by very few states, each with a period\nof 4\u03c0. The 2\u03c0-asymmetric terms do not cancel and the critical current is 4\u03c0-periodic.\n\n2.\n\nTransparent junctions\n\nTransparent junctions are more involved than tunnel junctions. One reason for their\ncomplexity is the strong coupling of the superconducting states on both sides of the junction,which does not allow to choose the phases of the corresponding order parameters independently. Consequently the phase difference \u03b4\u03c6 is not an adequate variable for describing\nthe current across the junction. Another reason is that the energy spectrum in a linear\njunction of the type shown in Fig. 12 changes strongly upon changing microscopic details of\nthe system, such as the strength of the repulsive potential U on the impurity sites in this\ncase. This is illustrated vividly by Fig. 14 showing the evolution of the highest occupied\nenergy levels with increasing U.\nThese problems can be resolved by using a square-frame geometry as in Sec. III B. Here\nthe Josephson junction is modeled by adding potential scatterers on a line as shown in\nFig. 15, and the current is driven by a magnetic flux \u03c6 threading the frame. For a tunnel\n\n27\n\n\fjunction, this would induce a phase jump of 4\u03c0\u03c6 in the order parameter aross the junction\nand thus a sin(4\u03c0\u03c6) current-flux relation. In transparent junctions, the jump is smaller and\nvanishes in a clean frame. For this topology the magnetic flux \u03a6 = \u03c6 * hc/e is related to the\nphase variation of the order parameter \u03b4\u03c6 by 2\u03c0\u03c6 = \u03b4\u03c6/2.\nFor sufficiently large U, say U = 100t, these impurities act as a geometrical constriction.\nFigure 16 shows explicitly that the spectrum of a square frame remains qualitatively invariant\nupon inserting a small number of impurities, even sufficiently strong to block the current\nover the impurity site completely. Figures 16 (b) and (c) show the spectra versus \u03c6 for two\nand four impurities for a 20 \u00d7 20 square frame with a 8 \u00d7 8 square hole. In the presence of\n\nimpurities, bound states arise at EF in a d-wave superconductor33,37 , which are nearly flux\nindependent. These bound states are easily identified in Figs. 16 (a) and (b) near the Fermi\nenergy. Otherwise, the spectrum in Fig. 16 (b) is very similar to that of the clean frame\ndiscussed in Sec. III B (Fig. 10). Clearly visible is the discontinuity of the spectrum where\nthe condensate reconstructs to a superconducting state with different winding number q.\n\nThe relevance of q is a characteristic property of transparency and directly connected to a\ndiscontinuity of the supercurrent (see Fig. 16 (a) for one and two impurities).\nFor three to five impurities, the supercurrent is continuous, as is the spectrum shown\nin Fig. 16 (c) for four impurities. Nevertheless, the typical features of the square-frame\nspectrum are still present, in particular the gap in the odd flux regimes and one energy\nlevel approaching EF in the even q regime. This level causes the wiggle in the supercurrent\n\nFIG. 15: For the description of transparent junctions, we choose the square-frame geometry and\nmodel the junction with potential scatterers arranged on a line crossing one side on the frame\n(black points). The current is driven by a magnetic flux threading the frame.\n\n28\n\n\fFIG. 16: Supercurrent J(\u03c6) and energy spectrum E(\u03c6) of a 20 \u00d7 20 square frame with an 8 \u00d7 8 hole\ncontaining a Josephson junction. The width of the arms for the frame is six sites. The impurity\npotential is U = 100t. (a) J(\u03c6) for one (blue), two (turquoise), three (green), four (orange), and\nfive (purple) impurity sites. Energy spectrum for (b) two and (c) four impurity sites.\n\naround \u03c6 = 0; its slope and that of a few others remain almost as steep as in a clean frame,\nwhich indicates the existence of channels with free current flow. The Doppler shift of nodal\nstates is therefore not negligible in the calculation of the supercurrent across transparent\nJosephson junctions, and it may cause appreciable deviations from the sin(4\u03c0\u03c6) current-flux\nrelation even in the case of wide junctions. The sin(4\u03c0\u03c6) is expected for the thermodynamic\nGinzburg-Landau limit.\nFinally we note that for five impurities, only one channel through the junction remains,\nwhich is almost blocked by the bound state. Thus the spectrum becomes nearly flux independent, leading to a junction in the tunneling regime. However, the supercurrent does not\nfollow the expected sin(4\u03c0\u03c6) but rather a sin(2\u03c0\u03c6) current-phase relation. This is due to\nthe point-contact like character of the junction and the extreme limit of the deformation\nof the current-flux relation as shown in Fig. 13 \u2013 similar to the left panel, however with\nJ(\u03b4\u03c6) \u223c \u2212 sin(\u03b4\u03c6/2).\n\n29\n\n\fB.\n\nField-threaded junctions\n\nA magnetic field threading a Josephson junction modifies the phase difference of the order\nparameters of the superconductors on both sides and thus alters the supercurrent. This\nbehavior is well understood on the basis of the Ginzburg-Landau approach. The currentflux relation of a linear junction that is homogeneous in y-direction has the shape of a\nFraunhofer diffraction pattern26 , although it deviates from the Fraunhofer form for all other\njunction geometries. Despite these deviations it preserves the characteristic flux periodicity\nof \u03a60 /2 for conventional Josephson junctions. The magnetic field dependent critical current\nof Josephson junctions is therefore another key property where the Doppler shift might cause\na doubling of the flux period.\nHere we use again the linear junction model of Sec. IV A 1 and fix the phase difference to\n\u03b4\u03c6 = \u03c0/2, for which the absolute value of the current across the junction in the tunneling\nregime is largest. In order to introduce a magnetic field threading the junction, we construct\nthe junction from single plaquettes with potential scatterers on each of its sites. All plaquette\nl which belong to the junction are threaded by a magnetic flux \u03c6l , generating Peierls phase\nfactors \u03c6lij . We restrict our discussion to a homogeneous field distribution inside the junction,\n\u03c6l = \u03c6 for all l, and the repulsive potential on the respective sites is U. In the presence of a\nmagnetic field, the system is not homogeneous in y-direction, and we have to diagonalize it\nin real space. This restricts the maximum system size for our analysis.\n\n1.\n\nCurrent-flux relation of tunnel junctions\n\nThe simplest model of a field-threaded Josephson junction consists of two lines of impurity\nsites as used in Sec. IV A 1 (Fig. 12). The current-flux relation of such a junction as obtained\nfrom the Bogoliubov \u2013 de Gennes equations is shown in Fig. 17 for s- and d-wave junctions\nwith a length of 14 sites and thus 13 plaquettes. Upon first glance, the current-flux relation of\nthe s-wave junction [Fig. 17 (a)] appears to be similar to the Fraunhofer pattern known from\nthe Ginzburg-Landau approach for linear Josephson junctions26 , as does the current-flux\nrelation for the d-wave junction [Fig. 17 (b)]. The characteristics are a central peak around\n\u03c6 = 0 with width \u03a60 and side peaks of decreasing height with width \u03a60 /2. They display\nthe expected global periodicity of 13\u03a60 , enforced by gauge invariance, if each plaquette is\n\n30\n\n\fFIG. 17: Absolute value of the maximum current flowing across a tunnel junction versus the total\napplied magnetic flux \u03c6 (in units of hc/e) obtained from the Bogoliubov \u2013 de Gennes equations\nsolved on a lattice with N = 16, M = 14, U = 5t, and \u03b4\u03c6 = \u03c0/2 in units of J(0). (a) s-wave\npairing with V0 = t. (b) d-wave pairing with V1 = 0.7t. Here \u03c6 is the flux within the junction.\n\nthreaded by an integer multiple of \u03a60 . On closer inspection of Fig. 17 (a) one finds that\nthe s-wave junction has one maximum surplus in one period of 13\u03a60 , whereas the d-wave\njunction has not. The width of the peaks in Fig. 17 (a) is therefore slightly smaller than\nthe expected value \u03a60 . In the following, we explain this effect jointly with an investigation\nof the current-flux relation of inhomogeneous junctions by analyzing the Ginzburg-Landau\napproach for a lattice model.\nWe consider a two-dimensional superconductor which is divided by a thin, quasi one-dimensional Josephson junction of width d oriented along the y-direction with d \u226a \u03bb, such\nthat screening currents are negligible; \u03bb is the London penetration depth. If the junction is\nthreaded by a constant magnetic field Bz (x, y) = Bz , the supercurrent across the junction\nderived from the Ginzburg-Landau equations is\nZ\nJ = dy jc (y) sin(ky),\n\n(50)\n\nwhere k = \u03c0Bz d/\u03a60 . The critical current density jc (y) is controlled by the microscopic\nstructure of the junction. If jc (y) is constant, one obtains the well known Fraunhofer pattern\nsin(\u03c0\u03a6/\u03a60 )\nJ(\u03a6)\n=\nJ(0)\n\u03c0\u03a6/\u03a60\n\n(51)\n\nfor the current across the junction; \u03a6 is the total magnetic flux through the area of the\njunction.\nOn a discrete square lattice with M lattice sites in y-direction and an order parameter\n\n31\n\n\fFIG. 18: Current-flux relation of a Josephson junction as in Fig. 17 but with M = 11 (10 plaquettes)\nas obtained from the Bogoliubov \u2013 de Gennes equations (blue) and from the discrete GinzburgLandau approach (turquoise).

(b) d-wave pairing: The peaks at \u03c6 = (M \u2212 1)/2 and \u03c6 = 0 have the opposite sign.\n\ndefined on the lattice sites (s-wave), Eq. (50) becomes\nJ=\n\nM\nX\n\njc,i sin(kyi ).\n\n(52)\n\ni=1\n\nIf jc,i is equal for all i, one obtains a flux dependence similar to the Fraunhofer pattern:\nM\n\nsin (k(M + 1)/M)\nJ(\u03c6) X\n=\nsin(kyi )/(M + 1) =\n.\nJ(0)\n(M\n+\n1)\nsin\n(k/M)\ni=1\n\n(53)\n\nThis formula reproduces the flux dependence of the supercurrent as obtained from the Bogoliubov \u2013 de Gennes equations (shown in Fig. 18), apart from slight deviations in the\namplitude around the central peak at \u03c6 = (M \u2212 1)/2. It explains naturally the deviation\nfrom the \u03a60 /2 periodicity: it is an effect of discreteness, caused by the fact that the number\nof lattice sites in y-direction exceeds the number of plaquettes by one.\n\u00bfFrom what has been explained for an s-wave junction, we construct a simple GinzburgLandau analogon for a d-wave junction. In a d-wave superconductor, the order parameter\nis defined on the bonds between two neighboring lattice sites, and we therefore define the\ncorresponding supercurrent as\nJ=\n\nM\n\u22121\nX\n\njc,i sin(k(yi + 1/2)).\n\n(54)\n\ni=1\n\nFor a constant jc,i we obtain\nM\n\u22121\nX\nsin (k)\nJ(\u03c6)\nsin(k(yi + 1/2))/M =\n=\n,\nJ(0)\nM\nsin\n(k/M)\ni=1\n\n32\n\n(55)\n\n\fFIG. 19: Current-flux relation calculated for a Josephson junction with M = 11 and an inhomogeneous impurity distribution. Top panel: The gray plaquettes in the profile of the junction have a\nscattering potential U = 100t, while the white plaquettes have U = 2t, thus leaving two transparent\nchannels through which almost the entire current flows. Blue: Bogoliubov \u2013 de Gennes equations\nand turquoise: Ginzburg-Landau model for (a) s-wave pairing and (b) d-wave pairing.\n\nwhich indeed reproduces the \u03a60 /2 periodic Fraunhofer pattern obtained from the Bogoliubov\n\u2013 de Gennes equations with nearest-neighbor pairing. The deviations in the amplitude are\nlarger than for the s-wave junction telling that the d-wave junctions fulfill the GinzburgLandau conditions not as well as the s-wave junction.\nThe Ginzburg-Landau formulae (52) and (54) are suitable also to calculate the supercurrent flowing across junctions with an inhomogeneous impurity distribution. It is instructive\nto compare also in this case the supercurrent to results obtained from the Bogoliubov \u2013 de\nGennes equations. Figure 19 shows such a comparison for a junction with M = 11 and\ncurrent flowing only through the two \"gaps\" between the white plaquettes in the top panel\nof Fig. 19. In the microscopic model, this is achieved by setting strong repulsive potentials U = 100t on the sites of the gray plaquettes and a small potential U = 2t on the\nwhite plaquettes. In the Ginzburg-Landau approach, we set jc,i = 0 except for the two\ntransparent channels. This system appears to be quite far from respecting the conditions\nfor the validity of the Ginzburg-Landau equations. Nevertheless, for the s-wave junction,\nthe results obtained from the Bogoliubov \u2013 de Gennes and Ginzburg-Landau equations are\nremarkably close. Even for the d-wave junction, the simple implementation of the GinzburgLandau equations reproduces the same features as the Bogoliubov \u2013 de Gennes equations,\nin particular it has maxima for similar values, but the amplitudes of the oscillations deviate\n33\n\n\fstrongly.\nThese considerations jointly lead to the conclusion that, even for small junctions where\ndiscreteness is pronounced, we do not find any indications that the Doppler shift has an effect\non the current-flux relation of Josephson junctions in the tunneling regime. The essential\ncharacteristics of the current-flux relation, especially the position of the current maxima,\nagree quite well with the Ginzburg-Landau approach, where these effects are not included.\n\n2.\n\nCurrent-flux relation of transparent junctions\n\nA magnetic field threading a Josephson junction generates a supercurrent circulating\naround the junction, similar to a vortex in a type II superconductor, but with the complete\nflux confined to the junction. If the junction is sufficiently transparent, the order parameter\nreacts to the current loop with a phase winding as in a flux-threaded ring, with a winding\nnumber q that minimizes the total energy. The superconducting state in a transparent\njunction is therefore characterized similarly as a loop by the quantum number q related to a\ncenter-of-mass motion of the Cooper pairs and the supercurrent across the junction changes\nsign when the condensate reconstructs to another q. Remarkably, if the transparency is\nreduced, the discontinuities vanish smoothly, the current-flux relation of the superconducting\nstate with fixed q becomes periodic in \u03c6, and in the tunneling regime, all states with different\nq become equivalent. This behavior is illustrated in Fig. 20, which shows E(\u03c6), J(\u03c6), and the\nspectrum for a uniform junction with nearest-neighbor pairing and U = 2t. The total energy\nconsists of a series of parabolae, which correspond to different phase winding numbers. The\nkinks in E(\u03c6) and in the flux dependence of the spectrum are sharp for small values of \u03c6,\nbut the finite repulsion on the junction smoothens the discontinuities in the supercurrent.\nAlthough the Doppler shift of the energy levels is not strongly pronounced in Fig. 20, the\nphysical phenomena typical for multiply connected geometries govern the field dependence\nof the supercurrent across a Josephson junction, if its transparency is sufficiently high.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nFor unconventional nodal superconductors we established within a momentum-space formulation for superconducting loops that hc/e oscillations are present in the flux dependence\n\n34\n\n\fFIG. 20: Characteristics of a transparent junction as obtained from the Bogoliubov \u2013 de Gennes\nequations in a system with N = 14 and M = 12 and a homogeneous impurity distribution with\nrepulsive potential U = 2t. (a) The total energy, (b) the Josephson current, and (c) the energy\nspectrum of the system versus the external flux through the junction.\n\nof the ground state. The calculations in momentum space were restricted to rotationally\nsymmetric systems like a cylinder, the energy spectrum of which depends sensitively on\nmicroscopic details. In Sec. III B we have provided an analysis of the flux periodicity in a\nsquare frame with d-wave pairing symmetry analogous to the cylinder geometry of Sec. II\nwith remarkably similar results. Nevertheless, the real-space calculations contributed to the\nunderstanding of the flux periodicity. We verified that the characteristic flux dependence of\nthe d-wave energy spectrum does not depend on the geometry or the absence of impurities.\nWithin the real-space formulation, we constructed and analyzed more complex systems, in\nparticular we investigated the periodicity of Josephson junctions. The idea that the Doppler\nshift drives energy levels through the Fermi energy in junctions between d-wave superconductors, and thereby doubles the periodicity of the current-phase relation, seemed natural,\nbut the physics turned out to be more subtle. Narrow junctions with only a few channels\nalways display a period in the phase difference of 4\u03c0, even for s-wave superconductors, and\nthe Doppler shift in tunnel junctions is too small to influence the current-phase relation.\nOnly for transparent junctions does the Doppler shift become important; in this regime the\n35\n\n\fsupercurrent across a Josephson junction behaves similar to the persistent supercurrent in\na loop. These observations are also valid for the current-flux relation of field-threaded junctions. The microscopic theory excellently reproduced the results from the Ginzburg-Landau\ndescription of Josephson junctions in the tunneling regime, even for nanoscopically small\nsystems with d-wave pairing.\nWe thank R.
