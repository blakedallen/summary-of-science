The main approximation involved is to negle t the orrelation between the fragments\nof the proje tile in the region where the intera tion with the target\nis important. The formalism makes use of hyper-spheri al harmoni s,\nRaynal-Revay oe\u001e ients and momentum-lo alized wave fun tions to\nexpand proje tile hannel wave fun tions in terms of produ ts of the\nhannel wave fun tion of the individual fragments. Within this approa h, the kineti energy and angular momentum of ea h fragment\nis onserved during the s attering pro ess. The elasti , inelasti and\nbreak-up S-matri es are obtained as an analyti ombination involving the bound wave fun tion of the proje tile and the produ t of the\nS-matri es of the fragments. The approa h is applied to des ribe the\ns attering of deuteron on 58Ni at several energies. The results are\nompared with experimental data and ontinuum-dis retized oupledhannels al ulations.\nPACS numbers: 24.10.Eq;24.50.+g;03.65.Nk;25.10.+s;25.70.B ;25.70.Mn\nNu lear Rea tions, S attering Theory, Three-Body Problem, Halo Nu lei, Elasti S attering, Inelasti S attering, Break-up\nRea tions.\nKeywords:\n\n\f1 Introdu tion\nIn the last years one of the main interests in nu lear physi s has been fo used\non the study of halo nu lei, i.e., weakly bound and spatially extended systems where one or two parti les (generally neutrons) have a high probability\nof being at distan es larger than the typi al nu lear radii (see refs. [1, 2\u2104 for\na general review on these nu lei). The ability to produ e se ondary beams\nof halo nu lei opened new possibilities of investigating their stru ture. Two\nbasi\n\nexperimental probes involving high energy rea tions have been devel-\n\noped to study halo stru ture.\n\nThe \u001crst one is to measure the momentum\n\ndistributions of the fragments\n\noming out after a\n\nollision with light stable\n\nnu lei [3, 4\u2104. The se ond probe treats the analysis of Coulomb break-up\nse tion when the nu lei are in ident on highly\n\nross\n\nharged targets [5\u00157\u2104.\n\nThe \u001crst type of rea tions has been treated in detail in a series of publi ations by the group of Aarhus [8\u001511\u2104.\n\nHere, the simplest approa h to\n\nunderstand halo nu lei fragmentation rea tions involves the instantaneous\nremoval of one of the parti les from the few-body halo system. Within this\napproa h, known as \u0010sudden approximation\u0011, one assumes that the binding\nsystem is removed without disturbing the motion of the\n\nonstituent parti les.\n\nThis approximation is only justi\u001ced for rea tion times mu h shorter than the\nhara teristi\n\ntime for the motion of the parti les within the few-body sys-\n\ntem. The sudden approximation has been extensively applied to the study\nof three-body halo nu lei, and in parti ular to the Borromean systems, i.e.,\nthree-body systems where all two-parti le subsystems are unbound [12\u001514\u2104.\nFinal intera tion between the two non-disturbed spe tators seems to play a\nru ial role in order to explain the narrow neutron momentum distributions\nmeasured. The parti ipant-target intera tion was \u001crst des ribed\n\nonsidering\n\nonly absorption. Further improvements have been in luded re ently, treating\nthe intera tion between the target and ea h of the halo parti les by means\nof a phenomenologi al opti al potential [15\u2104. The total\nobtained by adding the\n\nross se tion is then\n\nontributions from all the parti ipants in the halo\n\nnu leus. Pro esses where two or three halo parti les intera t simultaneously\nwith the target are negle ted. This is\nis only a\n\nonsistent with the fa t that the model\n\nurate for the outer part of the wave fun tion [11, 15\u2104. This means\n\nthat those geometri\n\non\u001cgurations where more than one halo parti le get\n\nlose to the target during the\n\nollision should be ex luded. This shadowing\n\ne\u001be t has been treated in previous works under di\u001berent approa hes. In the\nanalysis of the Aarhus group the shadowing is a\n\n1\n\nounted for by ex luding the\n\n\fparti ipant wave fun tion inside spheres around the two spe tators [11, 15\u2104.\nThe se ond type of probe to study the stru ture of halo nu lei is by means\nof Coulomb elasti\n\nbreak-up rea tions with a proje tile,\n\nand valen e neutrons, in ident on highly\nhas studied in detail elasti\n\nomposed by a\n\nore\n\nharged targets. The Surrey group\n\ns attering of halo nu lei from target within the\n\n\u0010adiabati \u0011 approa h, i.e., the intrinsi\n\nmotion is very slow\n\nompared to the\n\ns attering motion [16\u001519\u2104. Moreover, the intera tion between the proje tile\nand the target is des ribed\n\nonsidering only the intera tion between the\n\nore\n\nand the target. This requirement is relevant to Coulomb dominated pro esses\nwhen the\n\nore is\n\nharged and the valen e parti le is neutral. In the\n\nase that\n\nstrong intera tions dominate, the above requirement is most likely to be valid\nwhen the number of\nnu leons [16\u2104.\n\nore nu leons greatly ex eeds the number of valen e\n\nWithin these approximations, the elasti\n\nse tion fa torizes into two terms, the\n\nthe adiabati\n\nontains the e\u001be ts of the\n\nThe range of validity of the adiabati\n\nis also dis ussed in [17, 18\u2104\n\nross\n\nross se tion for a point-like proje tile\n\ns attered by the target, and a form fa tor that\nproje tile stru ture.\n\ndi\u001berential\n\napproximation\n\non luding that for a pure strong intera tion\n\napproa h is justi\u001ced for a given proje tile\u0015target system at\n\nsu\u001e iently high energy. On the\n\nontrary, in the\n\nase in whi h the Coulomb\n\nintera tion dominates the validity of the \u0010adiabati \u0011 approa h is questionable\nat forward s attering angles.\nApart from the approa hes mentioned, several other models have been\nproposed in the literature, starting from the pioneering work of Bang and\nPearson [20\u2104, in luding eikonal [21\u001523\u2104, semi- lassi al [24, 25\u2104, and mixed approa hes to des ribe dire t and sequential break-up [26\u2104.\nThe paper is organized as follows.

In se tion 4 the\non lusions are presented.\n\n2\n\n\f2 The Un orrelated S attering Approximation\nIn this se tion we introdu e a new approa h to des ribe the s attering of a\nweakly bound nu leus by a heavy target. As it will be shown later, the Smatri es to the bound and break-up states of the\n\nomposite system are given\n\nin terms of the ground state wave fun tion and the S-matri es\n\norresponding\n\nto the intera tion of the fragments with the target.\nThe intera tion of a\n\nomposite parti le with the target\n\nan be expressed\n\nas the sum of two terms. On one side, an average for e a ting on the\n\nentre\n\nof mass of the proje tile, whi h makes the proje tile to s atter but does not\nex ite or break it. On the other side, tidal for es that make the proje tile\nrotate, ex ite or break up. Then, when a\n\nomposite parti le s atters from a\n\ntarget there are two opposite e\u001be ts: i) the intera tion between the fragments\ntending to keep the fragments bound, and ii) the tidal for es tending to break\nthe system. In order to simplify our dis ussion, we assume that the mass of\nthe target is mu h larger than the masses of the fragments. The Hamiltonian\nan be written then as\n\n~p2\nP~ 2\n+\n+ vAB (r) + vAT (RAT ) + vBT (RBT )\n2M\n2m\nP~ 2\nP~A2\n+ B + vAB (r) + vAT (RAT ) + vBT (RBT )\n=\n2mA 2mB\n\nH =\n\nwhere\n\nM = mA + mB\n\nand\n\nm = mA mB /(mA + mB ).\n\nintera tion between proje tile and target\ning potential,\n\nvF (R) = h\u03c60 |vAT + vBT |\u03c60 i,\n\nR,\n\nwhi h does not a\u001be t the internal\n\nvT (R, r) = vAT (RAT ) +\n|\u03c60 i\n\nground state of the proje tile.\n\nthe tidal for es,\n\nNote that for large\n\noming from the gradient of\n\nompared to the for e between the fragments,\n\nvAB ,\n\nIn this model, the\n\nwhi h tends to break the proje tile. The fun tion\n\ndes ribes the intrinsi\ndistan es\n\n(2)\n\nan be written as the sum of a fold-\n\nstru ture of the proje tile, and a tidal potential,\n\nvBT (RBT ) \u2212 vF (R),\n\n(1)\n\nthat tend to keep them bound.\n\nvT ,\n\nare negligible\n\noming from the gradient of\n\nHen e, it is reasonable to ignore the\n\ntidal for es for large distan es.\nOn the\n\nontrary, for small distan es\n\nR,\n\ntidal for es\n\nan be large.

The hyper-angular momentum\n\nK\n\nprovides an upper bound for\n\nL\n\nJ , i.e., J \u2264 L+I \u2264 K . Thus, if we take a value of K given by Km = Lm ,\nwe an argue that for K > Km tidal for es are less important than the for es\nbetween the fragments.

It is very important to realize that the USA\nformulates di\u001berent approximations for H in terms of the value of K , and\nF\nnot in terms of R. Thus, H\u0304 (H ) is the approximate expression of H for any\n\nR,\n\nprovided that\n\nK \u2264 Km (K > Km ).\n\nIt is important to formulate the USA to ensure that the intera tion does\n\nK > Km . In order to do that,\nlet P be the proje tor on the states with K \u2264 Km and Q the proje tor on\nthe rest of states. The full Hamiltonians H an be expressed as HP + HQ.\nThe USA implies that the term HP is approximated by P H\u0304P , while HQ is\nF\napproximated by QH . This ensures that the time evolution of a state |ii\nis given by the sum of the evolution of P |ii and that of Q|ii, whi h remain\nnot\n\nouple states with\n\nK \u2264 Km\n\nto states with\n\nmutually orthogonal.\nWe\n\nan now study what our approximation implies regarding the S-\n\nmatrix.

As we will\nsee in next se tion, S\u0304 an be expressed in terms of the produ t of S-matri es\nof the two parti les A and B , and it remains in the spa e of states with\nK \u2264 Km .

Our\n\u001crst requirement is that the target is very heavy\n\nompared with the fragments\n\nof the proje tile. Although this assumption is not essential to the model it\nsimpli\u001ces importantly the general formalism. The USA arises from the fa t\nthat the three-body Hamiltonian orresponding to a\n\nomposite proje tile\n\nan\n\nbe written as a sum of two non-intera ting two-body Hamiltonians in two\nlimit\n\nases: i) when the tidal for es are negle ted, and ii) when the for es\n\nbetween the fragments of the proje tile are negle ted. In the \u001crst\n\nase, the\n\nproje tile remains in its ground state, the intera tion with the target is given\nby the folding potential and the S-matrix is given by the solution of the\nresponding two-body s attering problem\n\nSF (L, E).\n\nIn the se ond\n\nor-\n\nase, the\n\nparti les s atter independently. This means that if the initial wave fun tion\nis given by the produ t of in ident waves of the parti les, the wave fun tion\nin the \u001cnal state is\nby the\n\nhara terized by a produ t of outgoing waves, multiplied\n\norresponding S-matri es,\n\nSA (LA , EA )SB (LB , EB ).\n\nUSA one negle ts tidal for es in the s attering region\nseparations, whereas in the s attering region,\n\nThus, within the\n\norresponding to large\n\norresponding to small sepa-\n\nrations, the for es between the fragments of the proje tile are ignored. The\nregions of large and small separations are de\u001cned in terms of the hyper an-\n\nK . Large separations orrespond to K > Km , and small\nK \u2264 Km , with Km de\u001cned su h that its turning point orresponds to a distan e Rm for whi h tidal for es and the for es between the\nfragments are omparable. For K > Km the for es between the fragments\ndominate, while for K \u2264 Km tidal for es are more important. Thus, Km is\na parameter of the USA model. The other parameter, v\u0304 , is a onstant that\nsubstitutes the intera tion between the fragments when K < Km .\nThe proper boundary onditions for the region K \u2264 Km requires the\n\ngular momentum\nseparations to\n\nproje tion of the initial state in a dis rete basis of states whi h are strongly\nlo alized for\n\nertain values of the relative momentum of the fragments. These\n\nmomentum lo alized states\n\nan be transformed analyti ally to states whi h\n\nhave de\u001cnite values of the hyper-angular momentum\n\nK.\n\nThen, the Raynal-\n\nRevai oe\u001e ients are used to transform the initial states, given in terms of the\n\n22\n\n\fL\n\nproje tile-target angular momentum\n\nI,\n\nand the internal angular momentum\n\nto states that depend dire tly on the angular momentum of the fragments\n\nwith the target,\n\nLA\n\nand\n\nLB .\n\nFinally, a\n\nertain\n\nombination of\n\nK -values\n\nis\n\ndone in order to obtain states with strongly lo alized values of the kineti\nenergy of ea h fragment. This pro edure allows to write the S-matrix of the\nproje tile in terms of the produ t\nthe fragments, evaluated at\n\nSA (LA , EA )SB (LB , EB ) of the S-matri\n\nes of\n\nertain values of the energy and angular momen-\n\ntum of the fragments with respe t to the target. Then, the formalism\n\nan\n\nbe applied dire tly to des ribe s attering to bound and resonant break-up\nstates, as well as to dire t break-up states.\nThe main advantage of the USA is that it allows to express the S-matrix\nof the\n\nomposite system in terms of the wave fun tion of the bound states\n\nand the s attering S-matri es of the fragments with the target.\nmatri es\n\nan be easily obtained from\n\nal ulations that \u001ct the\n\nThese S-\n\nross se tions\n\nof s attering experiments of the fragments with the target. In this sense, the\nfragment-target intera tion is treated to all orders, and the only assumption\none makes on the rea tion dynami s is to negle t the\nfragments.\n\nwith previous treatments.\nin luded by means of\n\nompared\n\nE\u001be ts of absorption or \u0010shadowing\u0011, whi h are\n\nad\u2212hoc pro\u001cle fun\n\nappear naturally here, as o\nS-matri es\n\norrelation between the\n\nThus, the USA approa h presents some advantages\n\ntions in some spe tator models [8,9\u2104,\n\nurs in Glauber approa hes [22, 23\u2104, be ause the\n\nSA (LA , EA ) and SB (LB , EB ) of the fragments in lude the e\u001be ts\nLA and LB values. Compared with semi- lassi al ap-\n\nof absorption for low\n\nproa hes [24, 25\u2104, the USA does not make use of the\n\non ept of\n\nlassi al tra-\n\nje tories for the relative motion. Compared with Glauber analyses [22, 23\u2104,\nthe USA justi\u001ces the expression of the three-body S-matrix in terms of the\nprodu t of the S-matri es of the fragments from very general\n\nonsiderations,\n\nthat do not require to make use of the eikonal assumption of forward s attering, or straight line traje tories.\n\nAlso, our expressions depend on the\n\nS-matri es of the fragments evaluated at integer orbital angular momenta,\nwhile previous Glauber-type approa hes rely on evaluating by interpolation\nthe S-matri es of the fragments as a fun tion of real impa t parameters, whi h\nwould\n\norrespond to non-integer L-values. Finally, the USA also di\u001bers from\n\nGlauber-type approa hes, and other approa hes based on the adiabati\n\nap-\n\nproximation, for whi h the velo ity of all the fragments with respe t to the\ntarget is equal to the proje tile velo ity, and so the energies of the fragments\nare \u001cxed quantities proportional to the masses.\n\nIn the USA, the relative\nl\nl\nenergy of the fragments with respe t to the target, EA , EB an take di\u001berent\n23\n\n\fvalues, re\u001de ting the fa t that in the in ident proje tile the fragments have\na\n\nertain momentum distribution.\n\nAs the USA does not make use of the\n\neikonal approximation, whi h is essentially a forward-s attering approa h,\nwe\n\nonsider that it\n\nan be useful when applied to s attering of weakly bound\n\nhalo nu lei at low s attering energies,\n\nomparable to the Coulomb barrier.\n\nApart from the theoreti al formulation of the USA, we have also presented\n58\na preliminary appli ation of the approa h to the rea tion d+ Ni at 21.6\nand 80 MeV. The parameter\nzero.\n\nThis\n\nKm\n\nis set to a large value, and\n\norresponds to negle t\n\nv\u0304\n\nis taken as\n\nompletely the e\u001be t of proton-neutron\n\norrelation in the s attering. Con erning elasti\nUSA gives rise to a depletion of the\n\ns attering at 80 MeV, the\n\nross se tions at intermediate angles\n\nwith respe t to the folding model predi tion.\n\nThe experimental data and\n\nthe CDCC\n\nal ulations also show this depletion, although not so large as\n\u2032\nin the USA model. The break-up ross se tions at 80 MeV to I = 0 and\n\u2032\nI = 2 states in the USA approa h is onsistent with the CDCC al ulation.\n\u2032\nHowever, break-up ross se tions to I > 2 states, whi h are sizeable in the\nUSA, are strongly suppressed in the CDCC\n\nal ulations.\n\nWhen the USA\n\nal ulation of the elasti s attering is modi\u001ced to ex lude e\u001be tively the\n\u2032\noupling to I > 2 states, the experimental di\u001berential ross se tions and\nCDCC\n\nal ulations are very well reprodu ed. Using the same pro edure for\n\nthe elasti\na\n\nross se tions at 21.6 and 56 MeV, the experimental data are also\n\nurately reprodu ed.\nOur interpretation of these results for deuteron s attering is that the\n\nproton-neutron\n\norrelations, whi h are negle ted in the USA\n\nal ulation, play\n\na signi\u001c ant role. These orrelations show up in the evaluation of break-up\n\u2032\nross se tions to I > 2 states. Within the USA model, the proton and\nneutron s atter independently from the target, and so, after the s attering\nthey have a\n\nertain probability to end up in a state with large relative angular\n\nmomentum. However, in reality the proton and neutron remain orrelated,\n\u2032\nand this orrelation suppresses large I break-up omponents in the wave\nfun tion.\n\nOn e these\n\nomponents are ex luded, both elasti\n\nross se tions are well reprodu ed by the USA\n\nand break-up\n\nal ulation.\n\nWe expe t that, for the s attering of halo nu lei at energies around the\nCoulomb barrier, the e\u001be t of the\nless important than in the\n\norrelations between the fragments will be\n\nase of deuteron.\n\nThus, the un orrelated USA\n\nal ulation will be more reliable and we may expe t to see more\nfeatures of the USA\nthe elasti\n\nal ulations.\n\nlearly the\n\nThese in lude an important de rease of\n\nross se tion with respe t to the folding model predi tion, and\n24\n\n\fsizeable\n\nontributions to break-up with large angular momentum between\n\nthe fragments.\n\nA knowledgements\n\nWe a knowledge fruitful dis ussions with J.
