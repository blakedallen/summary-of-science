In this\ncase, the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NSP) would be unstable, with an abundance constrained by the concordance between the observed light-element abundances and\nthose calculated on the basis of the baryon-to-entropy ratio determined using CMB data.\nWe modify and extend previous CMSSM relic neutralino calculations to evaluate the NSP\ndensity, also in the case that the NSP is the lighter stau, and show that the constraint from\nlate NSP decays is respected only in a limited region of the CMSSM parameter space. In\nthis region, gravitinos might constitute the dark matter.\n\nCERN\u2013TH/2003-310\nDecember 2003\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIf R parity is conserved, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable, and a possible\ncandidate for the cold dark matter postulated by astrophysicists and cosmologists [1]. Most\nanalyses of such supersymmetric dark matter have assumed that the LSP is the partner of\nsome combination of Standard Model particles, such as the lightest neutralino \u03c7, with an\nabundance calculated from the freeze-out of annihilation processes in a thermal initial state.\nHowever, another generic possibility is that the LSP is the gravitino G\u0303 [2] - [8], whose relic\nabundance would get contributions from the decays of the next-to-lightest supersymmetric\nparticle (NSP) and possibly other mechanisms.\nAs we discuss in more detail below, the lifetime of the NSP is typically such that it decays\nbetween Big-Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the 're-' combination process when the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) was released from matter. Since NSP decays release entropy\nduring this epoch, they are constrained by the concordance of the observed light-element\nabundances with BBN calculations assuming the baryon-to-entropy ratio inferred from CMB\nobservations. For a typical lifetime \u03c4N SP = 108 s, the observed 6 Li abundance implies [9]\n100 GeV\nnN SP\n< 5 \u00d7 10\u221214\nn\u03b3\nmN SP\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(1)\n\nbefore NSP decay, with the D/H (4 He) abundance providing a constraint which is weaker\nby a factor of about 10 (20). Assuming a baryon-to-entropy ratio \u03b7 \u2261 nB /n\u03b3 = 6.0 \u00d7 10\u221210 ,\n\n\u221210\nin agreement with the WMAP result \u03b7 = 6.1+0.3\n[10], (1) implies the constraint\n\u22120.2 \u00d7 10\n\u22124\nnN SP /nB < 10 (100 GeV/mN SP ) before the onset of NSP decay. To assess the power of\n\nthis constraint, we re-express it in terms of \u03a90N SP h2 , the relic density that the NSP would\nhave today, if it had not decayed:\n\u03a90N SP h2 < 10\u22122 \u03a9B h2 \u2243 2 \u00d7 10\u22124,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03a9B h2 \u2243 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 is the present-day baryon density. However, the requirement (2)\n\nwould be relaxed for a shorter-lived NSP [7], as we discuss later.\nIn contrast, assuming that the lightest neutralino \u03c7 is the LSP, there have been many\n\ncalculations of \u03a9\u03c7 h2 in the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard\nModel (CMSSM), in which the GUT-scale input gaugino masses m1/2 and scalar masses m0\nare each assumed to be universal [11\u201314]. These calculations find generic strips of CMSSM\nparameter space in which\n\u03a9\u03c7 h2 \u223c 5 \u00d7 \u03a9B h2 \u223c 0.1\n(3)\n1\n\n\fThis is similar to the range of the cold dark matter density \u03a9CDM h2 favoured by astrophysicists and cosmologists, which is one reason why neutralino dark matter has been quite\npopular.\nIn this paper, we assume no a priori relation between m3/2 and the soft supersymmetrybreaking masses m1/2 and m0 of the spartners of Standard Model particles in the CMSSM.\nThis is possible in, e.g., the framework of N = 1 supergravity with a non-minimal K\u00e4hler\npotential [15]. In such a framework, the LSP might well be the gravitino G\u0303. In this case, the\nNSP would likely be the lightest supersymmetric partner of some combination of Standard\nModel particles, such as the lightest neutralino \u03c7 or the lighter stau \u03c4\u03031 . Particularly in the\n\u03c7 NSP case, one might expect \u03a90N SP h2 to be near the range (3). Comparing this with the\ncondition (2) necessary for gravitino dark matter, we see that, if \u03c4N SP = 108 s, gravitino dark\nmatter could be possible only in rather different regions of the CMSSM parameter space,\nwhere the NSP density is very suppressed compared with the usual \u03c7 density. Moreover,\nin this case, NSP decays alone could not provide enough gravitinos, since they could only\nyield \u03a93/2 h2 < \u03a90N SP h2 , so there would need to be some supplementary mechanism for\nproducing gravitinos, if they were to provide all the cold dark matter. For example, gravitino\nproduction during reheating after inflation could produce a sufficient abundance of gravitinos\nif the reheat temperature is relatively large, \u223c O(1010 ) GeV [7].\n\nThe first step in our exploration of the gravitino dark matter possibility is to calculate\n\u03a90N SP h2 throughout the (m1/2 , m0 ) planes for different choices of tan \u03b2 and the sign of \u03bc in\nthe CMSSM, assuming that the trilinear soft supersymmetry-breaking parameter A0 = 0.\nIn the regions where m\u03c7 < m\u03c4\u03031 , this is essentially equivalent to the usual neutralino dark\nmatter density calculation. However, as we discuss below, this calculation must be adapted\nin the region where m\u03c4\u03031 < m\u03c7 . Moreover, one must take into account the possibility of\na cosmological \u03c4\u03031 asymmetry, in which case the relic \u03c4\u03031 density would be larger than that\ngiven by the standard freeze-out calculation. We next compute the NSP lifetime and use\nthe detailed constraints from the abundances of the light elements as computed in (1) for\nfixed \u03b7 = 6 \u00d7 10\u221210 . This allows us to delineate the regions of the CMSSM (m1/2 , m0 ) planes\nwhere gravitino dark matter appears possible. We find limited regions of the (m1/2 , m0 )\nplanes that are allowed. In these regions, the density of relic gravitinos due to NSP decay\nis typically less than the range favoured by astrophysics and cosmology. As noted above,\nsupplementary mechanisms for gravitino production, such as thermal production in the early\nUniverse, might then enable gravitinos to constitute the cold dark matter.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nNSP Density Calculations\n\nIn the framework of the CMSSM with a light gravitino discussed here, the candidates for\nthe NSP are the lightest partners of Standard Model particles. In generic regions of CMSSM\nparameter space, these are the lightest neutralino \u03c7 and the lighter stau \u03c4\u03031 1 . In regions\nwhere \u03c7 is the NSP, the calculation of the NSP density \u03a90N SP h2 is identical with that of\n\u03a9LSP h2 in the CMSSM with a heavier gravitino, and we can recycle standard results.\nExtending these calculations of \u03a90N SP h2 to regions where the \u03c4\u03031 is the NSP requires some\nmodifications. Whereas the Majorana \u03c7 is its own antiparticle, one must distinguish between\nthe \u03c4\u03031 and its antiparticle \u03c4\u03031\u2217 , and calculate the sum of their relic densities. This requires\na careful accounting of the statistical factors in all relevant annihilation and coannihilation\nprocesses. We have also made a careful treatment of the regions where there is rapid \u03c4\u03031 \u2212 \u03c4\u03031\u2217\nannihilation via Higgs poles, and a non-relativistic expansion in powers of the NSP velocity\nis inadequate. Here our treatment follows that of the neutralino LSP case in [11, 13, 17].\nIt is important to note that one would, in general, expect a net \u03c4\u03031 asymmetry \u03b7\u03c4\u03031 \u2261 \u03bb \u03b7B ,\n\nwhere \u03bb \u223c O(1). This would be the expectation, for example, in leptogenesis scenarios,\nand would also appear in other baryogenesis scenarios, as a result of electroweak sphalerons.\nHowever, in the context of the MSSM, there exist \u03c4\u03031 \u03c4\u03031 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 annihilation processes which\n\nwould bleed away any existing lepton asymmetry stored in the \u03c4\u0303 sleptons, and the final relic\ndensity is given by the calculation described above.\n\n3\n\nNSP Decays\n\nUsing the standard N = 1 supergravity Lagrangian [18, 19], one can calculate the rates for\nthe various decay channels of candidate NSPs to gravitinos.\nThe dominant decay of a \u03c7 NSP would be into a gravitino and a photon, for which we\ncalculate the width\n\u0393\u03c7\u2192G\u0303 \u03b3\n\n2\nm5\u03c7\n1 C\u03c7\u03b3\n=\n16\u03c0 MP2 m23/2\n\nm23/2\n1\u2212 2\nm\u03c7\n\n!3\n\n1 m23/2\n+ 2\n3\nm\u03c7\n\n!\n\n(4)\n\nwhere C\u03c7\u03b3 = (O1\u03c7 cos \u03b8W + O2\u03c7 sin \u03b8W ) and O is the neutralino diagonalization matrix,\n\u221a\nO T MN O = Mdiag\nN .

The late injection of electromagnetic energy can wreak\nhavoc on the abundances of the light elements. Energetic photons may destroy deuterium,\ndestroy 4 He (which may lead to excess production of D/H), destroy 7 Li, and/or overproduce\n6\nLi. The concordance between BBN calculations and the observed abundances of these elements can be used to derive a limit on the density of any decaying particle. In general, this\nlimit will depend on both the baryon asymmetry \u03b7B , which controls the BBN predictions,\nand on the life-time of the decaying particle \u03c4X . For a fixed value \u03b7B = 6 \u00d7 10\u221210 , as suggested by CMB observations, the bounds derived from Fig. 8(a) in [9] may be parameterized\napproximately as\ny < 0.13 x2 \u2212 2.85 x + 3.16 ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere y \u2261 log(\u03b6X /GeV) \u2261 log(mX nX /n\u03b3 /GeV) and x \u2261 log(\u03c4X /s), for the electromagnetic\n4\ndecays of particles X with lifetimes 1012 s > \u03c4N SP >\n\u223c 10 s. In our subsequent analysis we\n\nuse the actual data corresponding to the limit in [9] in order to delineate the allowed regions\nof the (m1/2 , m0 ) planes, but (10) may help the reader understand qualitatively our results.\nThe other NSP decay modes listed above inject electrons, muons and hadrons into the\nprimordial medium, as well as photons. Electromagnetic showers develop similarly, whether\nthey are initiated by electrons or photons, so we can apply the analysis of [9] directly also to\nelectrons. Bottom, charm and \u03c4 particles decay before they interact with the cosmological\nmedium, so new issues are raised only by the interactions of muons, pions and strange\nparticles. In fact, if the NSP lifetime exceeds about 104 s, these also decay before interacting,\nand the problem reduces to the purely electromagnetic case. In the case of a shorter-lived\nNSP, we would need to consider also hadronic interactions with the cosmological medium [20],\nwhich would strengthen the limits on gravitino dark matter that we derive below on the\nbasis of electromagnetic showers alone. In the following, we do not consider regions of the\n(m1/2 , m0 ) planes where \u03c4N SP < 104 s.\nIt is sufficient for our purposes to treat the decays of \u03bc, \u03c0 and K as if their energies were\nequipartitioned among their decay products. In this approximation, we estimate that the\nfractions of particle energies appearing in electromagnetic showers are \u03c0 0 : 100%, \u03bc : 1/3,\n\u03c0 \u00b1 : 1/4, K \u00b1 : 0.3, K 0 : 0.5. Using the measured decay branching ratios of the \u03c4 , we then\nestimate that \u223c 0.3 of its energy also appears in electromagnetic showers. In the case of\ngeneric hadronic showers from Z or Higgs decay, we estimate that \u223c 0.6 of the energy is\nelectromagnetic, due mainly to \u03c0 0 and \u03c0 \u00b1 production.\nOur procedure is then as follows. First, on the basis of a freeze-out calculation, we\n\ncalculate the NSP relic density \u03a90X h2 = 3.9 \u00d7 107 GeV\u22121 \u03b6X . Next, we use the calculated\nCEF O\nlife-time \u03c4X to compute the ratio of the relic density to the limiting value, \u03b6X\nprovided by\n5\n\n\fthe analysis of [9], taking into account the electromagnetic energy decay fractions estimated\nabove. Finally, we require\n\u03b6X\n(11)\nr \u2261 CEF O < 1.\n\u03b6X\n\n5\n\nResults\n\nAs compared to the case of CMSSM dark matter usually discussed, in the case of gravitino\ndark matter one must treat m3/2 as an additional free parameter, unrelated a priori to m0\nand m1/2 . We incorporate the LEP constraint on mh in the same way as in [13] 2 , and it\nappears as a nearly vertical (red) dot-dashed line in each of the following figures. Regions\nexcluded by measurements of b \u2192 s\u03b3 are shaded dark (green). For reference, the figures\nalso display the strips of the (m1/2 , m0 ) planes where 0.094 < \u03a90N SP < 0.129. This density\nis the same as \u03a9LSP h2 in a standard CMSSM analysis with a heavy gravitino, extended to\ninclude the unphysical case where the \u03c4\u03031 is the LSP. We note the familiar 'bulk' regions and\n\ncoannihilation 'tails', as well as rapid-annihilation 'funnels' for large tan \u03b2 [17, 21]. If these\nfigures were extended to larger m0 , there would also be 'focus-point' regions [22, 23].\nWe now summarize our principal results, describing the interplay of these constraints\nwith those associated specifically with gravitino dark matter, studying the (m1/2 , m0 ) planes\nfor three choices of tan \u03b2 and the sign of \u03bc: (1) tan \u03b2 = 10, \u03bc > 0, (2) tan \u03b2 = 35, \u03bc < 0, and\n(3) tan \u03b2 = 50, \u03bc > 0. In each case, we consider four possibilities for m3/2 : two fixed values\n10 GeV and 100 GeV, and two fixed ratios relative to m0 : m3/2 = 0.2 m0 and m0 itself. If\nm3/2 \u226b m0 , the G\u0303 is typically not the LSP, and this role is played by the lightest neutralino\n\u03c7, as assumed in most analyses of the CMSSM. In each (m1/2 , m0 ) plane, we display as a\n(purple) dashed line the limit where the density of relic gravitinos from NSP decay becomes\nequal to the highest cold dark matter density allowed by WMAP and other data at the 2-\u03c3\nlevel, namely \u03a93/2 h2 < 0.129: only regions below and to the right of this contour are allowed\nin our analysis.\nFig. 1 displays the (m1/2 , m0 ) planes for tan \u03b2 = 10 and \u03bc > 0 3 . Panel (a) displays the\nchoice m3/2 = 10 GeV, in which case the LSP is the G\u0303 throughout the displayed region of the\n(m1/2 , m0 ) plane. Above and to the left of the (purple) dashed line, the relic density \u03a93/2 h2 of\ngravitinos yielded by NSP decay exceeds the 2-\u03c3 upper limit on the cold dark matter density,\n0.129, imposed by WMAP and other cosmological data. This region is therefore excluded.\n2\n\nFor simplicity, we do not show the LEP constraints on m\u03c7\u00b1 and m\u1ebd , which do not impinge on the regions\nof parameters allowed by other constraints.\n3\nThe case tan \u03b2 = 10 and \u03bc < 0 is very similar, with the exception that the b \u2192 s\u03b3 constraint is more\nimportant.\n\n6\n\n\fIn the regions below the (purple) dashed line, the relic G\u0303 density might be increased so as\nto provide the required cold dark matter density if there were significant thermal gravitino\nproduction, in addition to that yielded by NSP decay.\nThe light-element constraint on NSP decays is shown as the grey (khaki) solid line corresponding to r = 1, where r is defined in (11). Regions to the right and below this line\nare allowed by this constraint. Here, and in the remaining figures below, the region which\nsatisfies the abundance constraint is labelled r < 1. There is a solid (black) line with\nm1/2 \u223c 800 GeV which indicates where \u03c4N SP = 104 s. To the right of this line, \u03c4N SP < 104 s,\nthe case we do not consider here because additional constraints due to hadronic decays must\nbe included, so this region is left blank 4 . Here and in subsequent figures, the region that is\nallowed by all the constraints is shaded in light (yellow) color.\nWe see that there is an extended strip between the grey (khaki) solid line and the solid\n(black) line. This strip is truncated above m0 \u2243 650 GeV, because the relic density of\n\ngravitinos from NSP decay becomes too large. This is true up to \u223c 2900 GeV, where the\nrelic density drops as we approach the focus-point region. Here a small allowed region opens\nup as the r = 1 curve bends towards lower values of m1/2 . The allowed strip broadens in the\nlow-m0 region where m\u03c4\u03031 < m\u03c7 , below the dotted (red) line where m\u03c7 = m\u03c4\u03031 . In this region,\ngravitino dark matter is permitted.\nTurning now to panel (b) of Fig. 1, where the choice m3/2 = 100 GeV is made, we see\na near-vertical black line at m1/2 \u223c 250 GeV: the gravitino is the LSP only to its right.\n\nThe \u03c4N SP = 104 s line has disappeared to larger m1/2 , and is not shown. In this case the\n\u03a93/2 h2 constraint is much more important than in panel (a), forcing m0 to be relatively\nsmall, simply because m3/2 is larger. The only region allowed by the light-element constraint\non NSP decays is in the bottom right-hand corner, in the region where the \u03c4\u03031 is the NSP.\nIn panel (c) of Fig. 1, for m3/2 = 0.2m0 , there is also a black line to whose right the G\u0303\nis the LSP, which is now diagonal, and the \u03a93/2 h2 constraint is similar to that in panel (b).\nMost of the region allowed by the light-element constraint on NSP decays is in the region\nwhere the \u03c4\u03031 is the NSP, though a sliver of parameter space runs above the dotted curve.\nFinally, in panel (d) of Fig. 1, where now m3/2 = m0 , the G\u0303 constraint is more powerful,\nas is the \u03a93/2 h2 constraint, and the region finally allowed by the light-element constraint on\nNSP decays is again in the \u03c4\u03031 region.\nFig. 2 displays a similar array of (m1/2 , m0 ) planes for the case tan \u03b2 = 35 and \u03bc < 0. In\nthe case where m\u03c4\u03031 = 10 GeV, shown in panel (a), the most significant change compared with\npanel (a) of Fig. 1 is that the b \u2192 s\u03b3 constraint is more important, whilst the \u03a93/2 h2 , NSP\n4\n\nThis line would disappear to larger m1/2 already for m3/2 = 20 GeV.\n\n7\n\n\fm3/2 = 10 GeV , tan \u03b2 = 10 , \u03bc > 0\n\n400\n\nm0 (GeV)\n\nm0 (GeV)\n\n400\n\n300\n\nr<1\n\n200\n\nm3/2 = 100 GeV , tan \u03b2 = 10 , \u03bc > 0\n\n500\n\n\u03c4NSP < 104 s\n\n500\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n100\n\n0\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n0\n100\n\n1000\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\nm1/2 (GeV)\n\n500\n\n900\n\n1000\n\n0.129\n\n300\n0.094\n\nm0 (GeV)\n\n0.129\n\n0.094\n\n0.094\n0.129\n\nm0 (GeV)\n\n800\n\n0.129\n\n400\n\n0.094\n0.129\n\n300\n\n700\n\nm3/2 = m0 , tan \u03b2 = 10 , \u03bc > 0\n\n0.129\n\n400\n\n600\n\n0.0940.129\n\nm3/2 = 0.2 m0 , tan \u03b2 = 10 , \u03bc > 0\n0.0940.129\n\n500\n\n500\n\nm1/2 (GeV)\n\n0.129\n\n100\n\n0\n100\n\nr<1\n\n\u03c4NSP < 104 s\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n0.129\n\n100\n\nr<1\n\n200\n\n0.094\n0.129\n\n200\n\n200\n\n900\n\n1000\n\n0\n100\n\n1\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\nm1/2 (GeV)\n\nm1/2 (GeV)\n\nFigure 1: The (m1/2 , m0 ) planes for tan \u03b2 = 10, \u03bc > 0 and the choices (a) m3/2 = 10 GeV,\n(b) m3/2 = 100 GeV, (c) m3/2 = 0.2m0 and (d) m3/2 = m0 . In each panel, we show\nmh = 114 GeV calculated using FeynHiggs [24], as a near-vertical (red) dot-dashed line,\nthe region excluded by b \u2192 s\u03b3 is darkly shaded (green), and the region where the NSP\ndensity before decay lies in the range 0.094 < \u03a90N SP h2 < 0.129 is medium shaded (greyblue). The (purple) dashed line is the contour where gravitinos produced in NSP decay have\n\u03a93/2 h2 = 0.129, and the grey (khaki) solid line (r = 1) is the constraint on NSP decays\nprovided by Big-Bang nucleosynthesis and CMB observations. The light (yellow) shaded\nregion is allowed by all the constraints. The contour where m\u03c7 = m\u03c4\u03031 is shown as a (red)\ndiagonal dotted line. Panels (a) and (c) show as a black solid line the contour beyond which\n\u03c4N SP < 104 s, the case not considered here. Panels (b), (c), and (d) show black lines to\nwhose left the gravitino is no longer the LSP.\n8\n\n\fdecay and \u03c4N SP constraints do not change so much. The net result is to leave disconnected\nparts of both the \u03c7 and \u03c4\u03031 regions that are allowed by all the constraints.\nThe most obvious new feature in panel (b) of Fig. 2 is the rapid-annihilation funnel, which\naffects both the \u03a93/2 h2 and NSP decay constraints. The former acquires a strip extending to\nlarge m1/2 and m0 , whereas the latter would have allowed a region at large m1/2 >\n\u223c 1500 GeV\n\nthat is excluded by \u03a93/2 h2 . Combining this and the NSP decay constraint, we again find\ntwo disconnected allowed regions, one in the \u03c7 NSP region and one that is almost entirely\nin the \u03c4\u03031 NSP region.\nThe rapid-annihilation funnel is also very apparent in panel (c) of Fig. 2, which displays\n\nthe case m\u03c4\u03031 = 0.2m0 , where again a strip allowed by both the \u03a93/2 h2 and NSP decay\nconstraints extends to large m1/2 and m0 . There are again disconnected allowed regions in\nthe \u03c7 and (mainly) the \u03c4\u03031 NSP region. Note that this is constrained at large m1/2 and small\nm0 by the \u03c4N SP constraint. Finally, in panel (d) of Fig. 2, for m\u03c4\u03031 = m0 , the region allowed\nby the G\u0303 LSP, \u03a93/2 h2 and NSP decay constraints is restricted to the part of the (m1/2 , m0 )\nplane where the \u03c4\u03031 is the NSP.\nFig. 3 displays a similar array of (m1/2 , m0 ) planes for the case tan \u03b2 = 50 and \u03bc > 0.\nThe general features of the planes have some similarities to those for tan \u03b2 = 35 and \u03bc < 0.\nThere are differences in the interplays between the \u03a93/2 h2 and NSP decay constraints, but\nan important difference is the relative weakness of the b \u2192 s\u03b3 constraint. This has the\nconsequence that allowed \u03c7 and \u03c4\u03031 regions are connected for tan \u03b2 = 50 and \u03bc > 0. It is\ninteresting to note that this is the only case where the putative constraint imposed by the\nmuon anomalous magnetic moment a\u03bc impinges on the allowed region, as shown in panels\n(a) and (c).\nWe have seen in the above examples that many of the allowed parts of the (m1/2 , m0 )\nplanes are confined to regions where the NSP is the \u03c4\u03031 .\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have analyzed in this paper the possibility of gravitino cold dark matter within the\nCMSSM framework. Combining accelerator and cosmological constraints, particularly those\nfrom b \u2192 s\u03b3, \u03a93/2 h2 and the light-element constraint on NSP decays, we have found allowed\n\nregions in the (m1/2 , m0 ) planes for representative values of tan \u03b2 and the sign of \u03bc and\ndifferent values of m3/2 . Standard calculations of the NSP density before decay based on\nfreeze-out from equilibrium yield allowed regions where either the lightest neutralino \u03c7 or\nthe lighter stau \u03c4\u03031 may be the NSP.\n9\n\n\fm3/2 = 10 GeV , tan \u03b2 = 35 , \u03bc < 0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\nm0 (GeV)\n\nr<1\n\nm0 (GeV)\n\n2000\n\n\u03c4NSP < 104 s\n\nm3/2 = 100 GeV , tan \u03b2 = 35 , \u03bc < 0\n\nr<1\n\n1000\n\nr<1\nr<1\n0\n100\n\n1000\n\n0\n100\n\n2000\n\nm1/2 (GeV)\nm3/2 = 0.2 m0 , tan \u03b2 = 35 , \u03bc < 0\n\n1000\n\n0.094\n\n0.129\n\nm0 (GeV)\n\n2000\n\n0.129\n0.129\n\nm0 (GeV)\n\n2000\n\nr<\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\nm1/2 (GeV)\nm3/2 = m0 , tan \u03b2 = 35 , \u03bc < 0\n\n1000\n\n1\n\n0.129\n\nr<1\n\n0\n100\n\nr<1\n\n\u03c4NSP < 104 s\n1000\n\n2000\n\nm1/2 (GeV)\n\n0\n100\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\nm1/2 (GeV)\n\nFigure 2: As in Fig. 1, for tan \u03b2 = 35 and \u03bc < 0 and the choices (a) m3/2 = 10 GeV, (b)\nm3/2 = 100 GeV, (c) m3/2 = 0.2m0 and (d) m3/2 = m0 .

In addition to the quantities\nplotted in the earlier figures, here we also plot grey solid lines where a\u03bc = 44.5 \u00d7 10\u221210 , which\ncut off at small m0 the allowed regions in panels (a) and (c). The light (yellow) shaded\nregions are allowed by all the constraints.\n\n11\n\n\fOne limitation of our analysis is that it is restricted to \u03c4N SP > 104 s, in order to avoid\nissues related to the hadronic interactions of NSP decay products before they decay. Also,\nin this paper we have not discussed at much length what part of parameter space may be\nallowed in the focus-point region. Finally, we have analyzed here only a few examples of the\npossible relationship between m3/2 and the CMSSM parameters m0 and m1/2 .\nFor these and other reasons, there are still many important issues to analyze concerning\nthe possibility of gravitino dark matter. We have shown in this paper that such a possibility\ncertainly exists, and that the allowed domains of parameter space are not very exceptional.\nWe consider that gravitino dark matter deserves more attention than it has often received\nin the past. In particular, this possibility should be borne in mind when considering the\nprospects for collider experiments, since the allowed regions of the (m1/2 , m0 ) are typically\nrather different from those normally analyzed in the CMSSM.
