The close similarity between\nthe radio and X-ray structures, the agreement between predicted\nand observed flux levels, and, where it can be measured, the spectrum of the emission are all consistent with the inverse-Compton\nmodel (e.g. Hardcastle & Croston 2005). This allows us to use loberelated X-ray emission as a very sensitive probe of the energy density in low-energy electrons within the lobes, and, for example, to\nsearch for variations in the magnetic field and electron energy spectrum as a function of position (e.g. Isobe et al. 2002; Hardcastle &\nCroston 2005; Goodger et al. 2008). Comparison of the energy densities in electrons and magnetic field in the lobes with the external\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: m.j.hardcastle@herts.ac.uk\n\npressures (e.g. Hardcastle et al. 2002; Croston et al. 2004; Konar\net al. 2009) suggests that the lobes of these inverse-Compton detected sources do not contain an energetically dominant population\nof non-radiating particles such as protons.\nLess attention has been paid so far to the implications of\ninverse-Compton emission in the large number of objects in which\nit has so far not been detected. This includes, at the time of writing,\nall classical twin-jet FRI sources, as well as FRII radio galaxies\nin environments much richer than a poor cluster, including some\nwell-studied objects such as Cygnus A (Wilson et al. 2000), 3C 123\n(Hardcastle et al. 2001), 3C 295 (Harris et al. 2000) and 3C 220.1\n(Worrall et al. 2001). In such objects it is assumed that the inverseCompton emission is present at some level (as it must be, since\ninverse-Compton emission is a required counterpart of the observed\nsynchrotron emission) but is not readily visible, even in sources in\nwhich it might otherwise be predicted to be seen, because of the\nbright thermal bremsstrahlung from the group or cluster environment.\nSuperficially, this explanation makes some physical sense in\nthe case of the FRIIs in rich cluster environments. If we assume\n[motivated by the results of Hardcastle et al. (2002) and Croston et\nal. (2005)] that the internal pressure in these objects is dominated\n\n\f2\n\nM.J. Hardcastle & J.H.

(1977) scale; for Hydra A this is interpolated from the measurements\nat 160 and 750 MHz quoted by Kuhr et al. (1981), for Her A it is taken from Spinrad et al. (1985) and for Cyg A it is the Baars et al. value. \u03b1 is the lowfrequency spectral index, determined from the Kuhr et al. flux densities for Hydra A and taken from Spinrad et al. (1985) otherwise. LAS denotes the largest\nangular size of the radio structures (measured at low frequencies) and LLS is the corresponding linear size. The column densities quoted are the Galactic\nvalues from the compilations of Dickey & Lockman (1990: NRAO) and Kalberla et al.

The volume emissivity for inverse-Compton\nscattering of a given photon field goes as the number density of\nelectrons of the appropriate energy (with Lorentz factors \u03b3 \u2248 1000\nfor scattering of CMB photons into the X-ray at z = 0) and so the\nobserved inverse-Compton surface brightness goes as the line-ofsight depth through the lobe, L, times pext . On the other hand for\nthermal bremsstrahlung we have pext \u2248 (np + ne )kT , where T is\nthe temperature and np and ne are the proton and electron densities\nrespectively, we know that ne = \u03b7np where \u03b7 is a constant of order\nunity, and we have a volume emissivity that goes as np ne T 1/2 . It\nfollows that the volume emissivity scales as as L\u2032 p2ext /T 3/2 , where\nL\u2032 is a characteristic line-of-sight depth that depends on the spatial structure of the hot gas but that will be of the same order of\nmagnitude as L. Neglecting temperature effects (i.e. making the\nobservationally motivated assumption that T varies comparatively\nlittle over the typical environments of radio galaxies, and that differences in pressure are dominated by differences in density) we see\nthat there is a stronger dependence of the bremsstrahlung emissivity on pext than there is for the inverse-Compton emissivity; thus, at\nany given redshift (which fixes both the photon number density of\nthe CMB and the rest-frame waveband in which we are operating)\nwe expect that there will be some external pressure pext at which\nthermal bremsstrahlung will come to dominate the observed X-ray\nsurface brightness, and therefore will prevent a straightforward detection of inverse-Compton emission.\nIt is much less obvious that this type of argument can explain the lack of observed inverse-Compton emission in the lobes\nof FRI sources, which are often found in group environments very\nsimilar to those of low-power FRIIs and so might be expected to\nhave similar levels of inverse-Compton detectability. However, in\nthese sources we already know that the model discussed above is\nnot valid, in the sense that the internal pressure of the lobes is almost certainly not supplied by electrons and magnetic fields close\nto equipartition (e.g. Croston et al. 2008 and references therein).

In the past we have used the lack of\ndetected inverse-Compton emission to rule out models in which the\nenergetics of FRI lobes are dominated by electrons (e.g. Hardcastle,\nWorrall & Birkinshaw 1998b, Croston et al. 2003) but little work\nhas been done beyond that except in some rather specialized cases\n(e.g. Jetha et al. 2008).\nIn this paper we explore the constraints that can be put on\nthe level of lobe inverse-Compton emission that is present in systems, both FRI and FRII, in which it cannot readily be detected by\neye. We show that it is possible to place interesting limits on the\ninverse-Compton emission from powerful FRIs and intermediatemorphology sources even in rich environments, supporting a model\nin which electrons provide a negligible fraction of the internal pressure in the large-scale lobes of these objects. We argue that there is\na significant detection of inverse-Compton emission from the lobes\nof the powerful FRII Cygnus A, although the simulation-derived\nuncertainties on its normalization are large. Our results may shed\nsome light on the mechanism by which the large-scale components\nof radio sources in rich environments come to be dominated by a\nnon-radiating particle population.\nIn what follows we use a concordance cosmology with H0 =\n70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9m = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7. Spectral indices \u03b1\nare the energy indices and are defined in the sense that flux \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 ;\nthe photon index \u0393 = 1 + \u03b1.\n\n2 DATA\nOur aim is to select sources that sample a range of radio morphological or luminosity classes, from twin-jet to classical FRII sources,\nand that a priori plausibly should have a strong inverse-Compton\nsignal. In the past (Hardcastle & Croston 2005, Goodger et al.\n2008) we have based our selection on low-frequency radio flux, on\nthe basis that this is a good indicator of the presence of the electrons\nrequired to scatter microwave-background photons into the X-ray\nband. If we look at the brightest ten or so extragalactic objects in the\nsky at 100-MHz frequencies, the radio galaxies that do not yet have\nlobe inverse-Compton detections (setting aside the special case of\nCen A; see Hardcastle et al. 2009 for a discussion of the existing\nand future limits on inverse-Compton emission from this object)\nare Cygnus A (3C 405), Virgo A (M87, 3C 274), Hydra A (3C 218)\nand Hercules A (3C 348). Of these, we exclude M87 because of the\nvery complex relationship between its thermal X-ray emission and\nlarge-scale low-frequency radio structure (e.g. Simionescu et al.\n2007) leaving us with Cyg A, Her A and Hydra A (Table 1). Conveniently these three are, respectively, an archetypal FRII source,\nan object with intermediate FRI/FRII morphology (e.g. Gizani &\n\n\fIC emission from cluster radio galaxies\nLeahy 2003) and a plumed FRI, probably a wide-angle tail (by the\ndefinition of Leahy 1993), although it is worth noting (see Table 1)\nthat all three lie well above the original FRI/FRII luminosity break\n(L178 = 5 \u00d7 1024 W Hz\u22121 sr\u22121 ). All three of these radio galaxies lie in rich cluster environments and have X-ray emission that\nis clearly dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung and that does not\ndisplay a particular complex relationship to the radio source. Thus\nthey provide both a scientifically interesting sample and an appropriate starting point for a study of inverse-Compton emission in the\npresence of dominant thermal emission.\nLarge amounts of archival X-ray data are available for all three\nof these sources (Table 2). For Hydra A, with a largest angular size\naround 7 arcmin, we have chosen to use the XMM-Newton dataset\ndescribed by Simionescu et al. (2009), although there is also deep\nChandra data (Wise et al. 2007). For Her A we use unpublished\narchival Chandra data which go somewhat deeper than the observations described by Nulsen et al. (2005). Finally, for Cygnus A, we\nuse the extensive Chandra dataset described by e.g. Wilson, Smith\n& Young (2006).\nThe X-ray data were reprocessed from the archive in the standard manner using CIAO 3.4 for the Chandra observations and SAS\n8.0 for XMM. For the XMM data we filtered using the standard\nflags. As the observation was somewhat affected by flaring, we filtered data in the standard manner, using a light curve for the whole\nFOV of each camera in the nominal energy range 10\u201315 keV and\nexcluding intervals where the count rate in this band exceeded 1\ncount s\u22121 (pn) or 0.35 s\u22121 (MOS). No time filtering was necessary for the Chandra data. Spectra were extracted using especget\n(XMM) or specextract (Chandra) and grouped to have either 40\n(XMM) or 20 (Chandra) counts per bin after background subtraction (the larger binning factor used for the XMM data was intended\nto compensate for the lower signal-to-noise of the regions of interest). Throughout the paper spectral fitting was carried out using\nXSPEC 12.\nRadio data are necessary to interpret inverse-Compton detections or upper limits. For Cygnus A, we used the 5-GHz radio map\nof Carilli et al. (1991), obtained from the NCSA Astronomy Digital\nImage Library1 . For Hydra A, we used the 74-MHz and 330-MHz\nimages of Lane et al. (2004), kindly supplied by Wendy Lane, while\nfor Her A the maps used are the 1.4 and 5-GHz maps of Gizani &\nLeahy (2003), kindly provided by Paddy Leahy. X-ray images of\nthe three objects investigated in this paper, with radio contours and\nlobe regions overlaid, are shown in Fig. 1.\nFinally, for spectral fitting, especially of complex models, it is\nnecessary to have an estimate of the level of Galactic absorption.\nWhen searching for weak non-thermal inverse-Compton emission\nin the presence of strong thermal emission, an incorrect estimate\nof the absorbing column can lead to false positives (or negatives),\nwhile leaving it free in the fits is also likely to have bad effects.\nThere are several sources of systematic errors in the standard way\nof inferring this from the Galactic neutral hydrogen column density, NH . Firstly, we invariably make the assumption, except when\nforced not to, that the neutral hydrogen is the only tracer of metals in the Galaxy, although molecular hydrogen can be important at\nsome locations on the sky; secondly, we assume a fixed elemental\nabundance in the absorbing material; and thirdly, we have to rely on\nradio-based measurements of the column density which may not be\naccurate. The first of these is not known to be a problem in the case\nof any of our targets, and there is little we can do about the second.\n\nHowever, to assess the degree to which the third is a problem, we\nused two different widely used databases to estimate interpolated\nvalues for the Galactic NH . These were the compilation of Dickey\n& Lockman (1990), as provided by the standard Chandra on-line\nproposal planning tool COLDEN2 , and the more recent, higherresolution Leiden/Argentine/Bonn Galactic HI survey (Kalberla et\nal. 2005) for which an on-line search tool is also available3 . Both\nvalues are tabulated in Table 1 and it will be seen that there are\ndifferences at the level of 10\u201320 per cent for each source, which\nallows us to get an idea of the potential systematic effects on the\nresults. We comment below on the effects of using the two different estimates of Galactic NH in our spectral fitting.\n\n3 METHODS\nIn systems in which there is a clear excess of X-ray emission associated with the lobe, estimating the inverse-Compton flux and, if\npossible, measuring its spectrum is relatively easy, using local (offlobe) background regions to account for contamination by thermal\nemission from the regions in front of and behind the lobe (as done\nby, e.g., Hardcastle & Croston 2005). By doing this we implicitly\nassume that any difference between the surface brightness of thermal emission on and off-lobe may be neglected; this is a safe assumption if the lobe-related emission is clearly dominant.\nThe situation is very different in our chosen targets. Here it is\nno longer safe to assume that the variation in the surface brightness\nof the thermal emission can be neglected; there may well be visible\n'cavities' in the thermal emission associated with the lobes, as already seen in Cygnus A (Wilson et al. 2006) and Hydra A (Wise et\nal. 2007), in which case na\u0131\u0308ve local background subtraction would\ngive negative fluxes for any inverse-Compton emission. More problematically, there may be variations in the temperature or abundance of the thermal emission on scales comparable to those of the\nlobe. Failure to account for these can in principle give spectral differences between the lobe and off-lobe regions that can mimic the\npower-law spectrum of inverse-Compton emission. On the other\nhand, accounting for them by allowing the fitted temperature or\nabundance of the thermal emission coincident with the lobe to vary\nfreely will almost certainly reduce or remove any spectral evidence\nfor additional inverse-Compton emission. In assessing the implications of any spectral detection or non-detection of inverse-Compton\nemission it is necessary to understand (1) whether the method being employed is actually capable of detecting inverse-Compton if\nit is present, (2) whether it is biased and what the uncertainties are\non any detection, and (3) what upper limits on inverse-Compton\nemission can be assigned in the case of a non-detection.\nTo investigate these problems we carried out extensive XSPEC\nsimulations for each source. We first defined spectral extraction\nregions appropriate to the lobes of the radio sources of interest.\nThese consisted of the lobe region itself; two adjacent, identically\nsized regions ('off-lobe' regions) intended to allow us to estimate\nthe local properties of thermal emission; and an 'off-source' background region for which the surface brightness of thermal emission\nwas much less than that in the on-source regions (though for all of\nthese sources it is hard to select a local background region which\nis free of any thermal emission) which was used as background\nfor all three on-source regions. We extracted spectra from these\n\n2\n1\n\nhttp://imagelib.ncsa.uiuc.edu/imagelib.html\n\n3\n\n3\n\nSee http://cxc.harvard.edu/toolkit/colden.jsp .\nSee http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/ \u0303 webaiub/english/tools labsurvey.php\n\n\f4\n\nM.J.

(Details of the fitted results\nfor the target sources are discussed in the next section of the paper.)\nUsing these fits we were then able to simulate, within XSPEC,\nrealistic observations of sources with comparable properties, using the response files determined from the real datasets. Our simulations included a spectrally realistic background (modelled using fits to the real background data) and the simulated data were\nbackground-subtracted and grouped in exactly the same way as for\nthe real data. The normalizations of the thermal (APEC) models\nused for the three on-source regions, and their metal abundance\n(assumed constant, since spatial variations in abundances for our\ntargets, though non-zero where they have been investigated, are not\nlarge on the relevant scales: see Simeonescu et al. (2009) and Smith\net al. (2002) for the cases of Hydra A and Cygnus A respectively),\nwere based on the real data, so that the statistics were guaranteed to\nbe realistic. However, the temperatures of the thermal models were\nnot fixed for each simulation, but drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a mean set equal to the temperature determined from a\njoint fit to the two off-lobe regions and with a dispersion estimated\nfrom the standard deviation of the two individually fitted temperatures; this was intended to take account both of the uncertainty\nin the fitted temperatures and of the possibility of variation in the\ntemperature as a function of the position in the cluster. In addition, a power-law component with a fixed photon index (for these\nsimulations we initially used 1.5; see below for more discussion of\nthis point) and a variable normalization was added to the simulated\ndata for the lobe region. For a non-zero normalization of this component, we could investigate whether a given method for estimating\nthe level of inverse-Compton could recover an unbiased estimate of\nthe normalization and estimate confidence limits on fits. If the normalization was set to zero, the simulations allowed us to estimate\nupper limits for non-detections.\nWe emphasise that this method is mainly designed to assess\nthe effect on the power-law normalization of point-to-point variations in the temperature and normalization of a single-temperature\nmodel. Taking account of possible multiple temperatures within a\nregion would be possible, but cumbersome, and clearly impossible\nto do in full generality, since the regions of interest could contain an\narbitrary number of different components. However, the uncertainties on the power-law normalization should be reasonably accurate\n\nto the extent that the orginal models used are reasonable representations of the off-lobe regions, i.e. that the fit of a single-temperature\nmodel is reasonably good. We do not require a thermal model to\nrepresent the cluster physics exactly so long as it characterizes the\noverall spectral shape and its variations adequately.\nWithin this framework we investigated four possible methods\nfor estimating the level of inverse-Compton emission from the lobe\nregions from spectral fitting. In all four, the basic approach was to\nfit models consisting of thermal emission only to the two off-lobe\nregions and a model consisting of thermal emission plus a powerlaw component with fixed \u0393 = 1.5 to the lobe region, with the\nthermal normalizations of all regions free to vary in order to take\nproper account of the known or probable cavities in the X-ray emission associated with the radio lobes. The models differed in the way\nin which they related the properties of the thermal emission from\nthe off-lobe and lobe regions, as summarized below:\n(i) Abundances for lobe and off-lobe regions are tied together,\nbut the on-lobe temperature is free to vary.\n(ii) Both abundances and temperatures for the lobe and off-lobe\nregions are tied together (i.e. we fit a single temperature and abundance for the whole region).\n(iii) The two off-lobe regions are allowed to have different temperatures, and the temperature fitted to the lobe region is constrained to be the mean of the temperatures fitted to the two off-lobe\nregions (the abundance is jointly derived from the two off-lobe regions; as in practice little abundance variation is seen, a model in\nwhich the mean abundance was used would be similar).\n(iv) A single temperature and abundance are determined from a\njoint fit to the off-lobe regions only, and then frozen in a separate\nfit to the lobe region (i.e. only the normalization of the thermal\nand non-thermal components are free to vary in the fit to the lobe\nregion).\nClearly these four models represent different tradeoffs between, on the one hand, the necessity to constrain some aspect of\nthe lobe model from the off-lobe data and, on the other, the recognition that properties of the thermal emission may be different for\nlobe and off-lobe regions. The simulations showed, however, that\nonly the most restrictive model (model iv) allowed an unbiased recovery of low-level simulated power-law emission. In models (i)(iii), the normalization of the recovered power-law component was\nalways systematically low, presumably because either the abundance or the temperature of the dominant thermal model tended to\nvary so as to account for some of the simulated power law. Model\n\n\f6\n\nM.J. Hardcastle & J.H. Croston\n\n(iv) is unbiased, even in the presence of quite large scatter in the\nsimulated temperature for the three regions4 , although of course\nlarger uncertainties on the true temperature in the lobe region result\nin larger scatter on the inferred power-law normalization. In what\nfollows, therefore, we use model (iv) to estimate the normalization\nof the power-law component in fits to the real data, and we interpret\nthe results using the confidence limits on power-law normalization\nderived from simulations.\nFinally, we investigated the results of using a steeper photon\nindex for the simulated power laws. As we will discuss below, it is\nnot clear what the appropriate photon index for inverse-Compton\nmodels is. We found that steeper photon indices produce systematically higher upper limits on the 1-keV power-law normalization.\nThis is presumably because the difference between thermal and\nnon-thermal models is most obvious at the highest energies: softer\nnon-thermal models are more easily concealed by thermal emission. Although we use the results of the simulations with \u0393 = 1.5\nin what follows, we comment where appropriate on the effects of a\nsteeper photon index.\n\n4 RESULTS\nFor each of the three sources we extracted spectra and carried out\nspectral fits for the on- and off-source regions shown in Fig. 1 and\ndescribed in the following subsections. The results of the fits (for\nboth values of NH ) are tabulated in Table 3. Errors quoted are 1\u03c3\nstatistical errors except where otherwise stated. Constraints on the\nparticle content as a function of assumptions about the electron energy spectrum are summarized in Table 4.\n4.1 Hydra A\nFor Hydra A we extracted spectra for and around the large-scale\nbubble seen in low-frequency radio observations (Fig. 1), as this\nseemed to us to be the region of the source that was most likely to be\nbright in inverse-Compton emission compared to its surroundings.\nThe best-fitting temperatures for the off-lobe, cluster regions\naround 3.6 keV and abundances around 0.30 solar (Table 3) are\nin reasonably good agreement with the properties of the ICM at\nthis distance from the nucleus obtained by Simionescu et al. (2009)\nusing a more complex thermal model. Fixing the temperature and\nabundance for the lobe region and allowing the normalization of the\npower law to vary, we obtain a power-law normalization consistent\nwith zero within the errors derived from the fit for both values of\nNH . Using our XSPEC simulations, we derive a 99 per cent confidence upper limit on the power-law normalization corresponding\nto 39 nJy at 1 keV for the NRAO NH values: the values from the\nalternative NH value are similar.\nWe can now ask what this implies for the electron population.\nClearly the number density of the population of electrons around\n\u03b3 \u223c 1000 cannot be so high as to cause the inverse-Compton emission to exceed the limit we have derived. For a given assumption\nabout the low-energy (\u03b3 < 1000) electron energy spectrum, which\nis not constrained by any observation, we can then put an upper\n4\n\nOne can imagine that model (iv) would be biased in a situation in which\nthe thermal component of the lobe spectrum had a temperature, abundance\nor normalization that was systematically biased with respect to the off-lobe\nspectra, but it is essentially impossible to deal with this situation with the\nexisting data, so we must simply make the assumption that this is not the\ncase in order to proceed.\n\nlimit on the amount of the internal pressure of the lobe provided by\nelectrons. The low-energy electron energy spectrum is parameterized by the electron energy index p, such that N (E) = N0 E \u2212p ,\nand the low-energy Lorentz factor cutoff, \u03b3min , and the ratio of\nthe energy density in non-radiating particles and in electrons is\ngiven by the factor conventionally denoted \u03ba. Making the assumptions that the lobe is a sphere uniformly filled with electrons, nonradiating particles and magnetic field such that (1) the observed\nsynchrotron spectrum is reproduced, (2) the external thermal pressure is equal to the internal pressure due to the particles and field\n(this is a conservative assumption; the internal pressure cannot be\nless than the external pressure), and (3) the lobe is not magnetically dominated, we can then ask what values of p, \u03b3min and \u03ba\nare consistent with the inverse-Compton upper limit. To do this we\nused the inverse-Compton code of Hardcastle, Birkinshaw & Worrall (1998a), which numerically integrates the results of Rybicki &\nLightman (1979) for an arbitrary electron energy spectrum given\na spherical source geometry, taking into account scattering of both\nthe microwave background and synchrotron photons. We took the\nexternal pressure to be 3.2 \u00d7 10\u221212 Pa, based on our measured\ntemperature and an external density derived from the deprojection\nof David et al. (2001) for a radius of 3.5 arcmin.\nWe initially limited the parameter space to be explored by\nmaking the conservative assumption that \u03b3min = 1. Then for p = 2\n(a conventional choice based on the assumption of first-order Fermi\nparticle acceleration) the upper limit on inverse-Compton emission becomes a lower limit on \u03ba: we find that \u03ba > 16 for these\nchoices. In other words, for these assumptions, the electrons contribute < 1/17 of the energy density in the lobe, with the balance being made up almost entirely of non-radiating particles. (Assumption (3) above means that the magnetic field energy density\nis always negligible in comparison to the particle energy density,\nthough for very large values of \u03ba it starts to exceed the electron energy density.) Increasing \u03b3min decreases the total electron energy\ndensity further: for \u03b3min = 10 the electrons contribute < 1/23 of\nthe energy density in the lobe.\nHigher values of p rapidly increase the total electron energy\ndensity for a given constraint at \u03b3 \u223c 1000. So with p = 2.5,\n\u03b3min = 1 we find that the upper limit on the electron energy density\nis < 1/3 of the total, falling to < 1/8 for \u03b3min = 10. For p = 3.0,\nthe inverse-Compton emission provides no constraint for \u03b3min = 1\nbut restricts the electron energy density contribution to <\n\u223c 1/2 the\ntotal for \u03b3min = 10. These limits are in fact less strong than they\nappear, since a choice of p > 2.0 means that the inverse-Compton\nphoton index should be > 1.5, which, as discussed above, increases\nthe limits on the power-law normalization and so the 1-keV flux,\nnot taken into account in the above calculations. However, the flat\nspectral index (\u03b1 = 0.73) measured at high frequencies at the base\nof the lobes in Hydra A (Taylor et al. 1990) is inconsistent with\np > 2.5, while it has been argued (Young et al. 2005) that p \u2248 2.0\nis the correct value to adopt in FRI sources. We consider that the\nresults for p = 2.0 are the ones most likely to reflect reality.\n4.2 Her A\nFor Her A we investigated both the E and W lobes. Because of\nthe symmetry of the source we were able to use identical off-lobe\nregions for both lobes. There is a clear detection of the E jet in this\nChandra observation, corresponding to the radio structures denoted\nE5, E6 and E11 by Gizani & Leahy (2003), which we mask out in\nour observation of the E lobe.\nThe best-fitting temperature for the off-lobe regions was 4.9\u00b1\n\n\fIC emission from cluster radio galaxies\n\n7\n\nTable 3.

(2005),\nbearing in mind that our regions necessarily span the strong surface brightness drop described in that paper. For both lobes and for\nboth NH values, a fit with fixed temperature and abundance gave a\nbest-fitting power-law normalization of zero. There is thus no spectroscopic evidence for inverse-Compton emission in this source despite the clear elongation of the X-ray emission in the direction of\nthe lobes. The 99 per cent upper limit on the inverse-Compton flux\nfor both lobes that we derive from our XSPEC simulations corresponds to a flux density at 1 keV of 38 nJy, independent of the\nchoice of NH value. This comparatively large value is a result of\nthe large difference (nearly 0.6 keV) between the best-fitting temperatures for the two off-lobe regions when fitted separately.\n\nUsing the deprojection of Nulsen et al. (2005) we estimate\nthe pressure at the radius of the lobes, 1 arcmin, to be 7 \u00d7 10\u221212\nPa. (This is the pressure just inside the surface brightness/density\njump.) Applying the same method as used for Hydra A, we find that\nthe electrons can contribute at most 1/4 of the total particle energy\ndensity for p = 2, \u03b3min = 1, and around 1/6 for \u03b3min = 10.\nFor p \u2265 2.5 with \u03b3min = 1, the inverse-Compton limit imposes\nno constraint on the fraction of internal energy contributed by the\nelectrons (i.e. they can provide all the required internal pressure\nwithout violating the limit). As the flattest-spectrum structure in\nthe jet has \u03b1 \u2248 0.6 (Leahy & Gizani 2003) there is some evidence\nthat p is likely to be close to 2.0, assuming that most particle acceleration takes place in the jet and that the injection spectral index is\nflat. The X-ray detection of the jet supports this model in the sense\nthat it suggests that particle acceleration does take place in the jet,\nassuming a synchrotron origin for the X-rays.\n\nWe note that the strong depolarization asymmetry (Gizani &\nLeahy 2003) implies that the source is some way from the plane\nof the sky (Gizani & Leahy 2004 estimate an inclination angle of\n40\u25e6 to the line of sight). Including projection in our analysis would\ndecrease the external pressure but increase the expected inverseCompton emissivity (since the lobes would be larger) so the limits\non the contribution of electrons to the total energy density would\nremain roughly similar. Detailed modelling of the cluster density\nprofile and the constraints on projection angle imposed by the observed depolarization should be possible with existing data, but is\nwell beyond the scope of the present paper.\n\n4.3 Cygnus A\nFor Cygnus A we extracted spectra for both radio lobes, masking out the well-known X-ray detected hotspots (e.g. Harris et al.\n1994). Overlapping but independent off-lobe regions were used for\nthe two lobes. There is evidence for temperature variation within\nthe lobe and off-lobe regions in discrete features (Wilson, Smith &\nYoung 2006; Belsole & Fabian 2007) but the contribution to the\nspectrum of these features, given their low surface brightness contrast, is expected to be minimal and we do not attempt to exclude\nthem.\nFor the W lobe the derived temperatures and abundances for\nthe NRAO NH are very similar to those expected from the radial\nprofiling of earlier work (e.g. Smith et al. 2002) (our regions extend\nbetween about 0.2 and 1 arcmin from the nucleus). The best-fitting\ntemperatures are significantly higher using the lower LAB column\ndensity, but the \u03c72 values are also significantly worse, consistent\nwith the fact that Smith et al. fitted a NH \u223c 3.1 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 .\nHere the addition of a power-law model gives a well-constrained\nnon-zero normalization corresponding to 82 nJy (NRAO) or 72 nJy\n(LAB), well above the detection threshold from simulations. Deriving 90 per cent confidence error bars from simulation, we can\nclaim a detection with a flux of 82+50\n\u221260 nJy at 1 keV (here and hereafter we only use the values corresponding to the NRAO NH value,\nnoting that the results are similar for the LAB NH , so that we are\nnot dominated by systematic errors).\nFor the E lobe we again find an apparent detection of powerlaw emission, this time with a flux density of 185+60\n\u2212120 nJy again\nwith 90 per cent confidence error bars derived from simulation). For\nthis lobe, the power-law component represents a little less than half\nof the total counts seen in the spectrum. In both cases, of course,\nwe are fitting a power-law model with a fixed photon index of 1.5,\nand consequently we cannot rule out the possibility that the second spectral component is a hot thermal component (with kT >\n\u223c 10\nkeV) but we neglect this possibility in what follows since we have\nan a priori reason to suppose that we might see a hard power-law\ncomponent in Cyg A. The effect of reducing the assumed NH is\nseen (Table 3) to be, as expected, to reduce the inferred flux density\nin the power law, but in neither case does it render the detection\ninsignificant.\nGiven the very large error bars (which arise because of the\nlarge amount of temperature structure in Cyg A: essentially the\nsimulations are taking into account the fact that we do not know\nthe true temperature associated with the thermal emission from the\nlobes) the fluxes of the two lobes are consistent with each other.\n\n\f8\n\nM.J. Hardcastle & J.H. Croston\n\nThe fact that the E lobe appears brighter may partially be explained\nby the fact that this lobe contains a relatively bright linear feature\nwhich (in spectral fitting with a power-law model using local background subtraction) could account for around 28 nJy of the powerlaw flux. However, as the flux of this feature is negligible within\nthe uncertainties on our measurement, we do not correct for it in\nour analysis.\nWe briefly investigated whether the normalization we had estimated for the power-law component could be affected by the\npresence of temperature structure in the cluster. We considered the\nspectrum of the western off-lobe region since the western lobe detection is considerably the weaker of the two. Initially we noted\nthat when we fitted the temperature of these two regions with a free\nGalactic NH the value we obtained was 3.1 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 ; this is\nconsistent with the results of Smith et al. (2002) and very similar\nto the NRAO value. This is encouraging since spectra where multitemperature effects are significant are often best fitted with NH values significantly below the Galactic value. Fixing NH to the NRAO\nvalue again, we next fitted the spectra of the western off-lobe regions with a model consisting of the sum of two APEC models,\nwith tied but free abundances and completely free temperatures and\nnormalizations. This gave a moderate improvement in the fit to the\nspectrum (\u03c72 = 3212 for 3125 degrees of freedom: compare results for single-temperature fits in Table 3) with kT1 = 2.78+0.46\n\u22120.17\nkeV, kT2 = 7.44+0.80\n\u22120.38 keV, abundance 0.98 \u00b1 0.04 solar. However, when we fitted this model, with fixed temperatures and abundances but free normalizations for the two temperatures, together\nwith an additional power-law component, to the spectrum of the\nW lobe, the fitting statistic was basically identical to that for the\nsingle-temperature model (\u03c72 = 1628 for 1674 d.o.f.) and the\npower-law normalization was essentially unchanged (71 nJy at 1\nkeV). Similar results were found for the E lobe. We conclude that\ntemperature structure of this type has little effect on our results,\nthough of course a strongly spatially varying soft component with\nlow abundance could mimic our power-law detection.\nWe therefore considered the implications of these apparent detections of inverse-Compton emission for the particle content of\nthe source. We take the external electron densities estimated for the\nCygnus A lobes by Dunn & Fabian (2004) which, together with\nour temperatures, give an external pressure of 6 \u00d7 10\u221211 Pa at the\nmid-point of the lobes, \u223c 40 arcsec from the core [this agrees with\nearlier estimates, such as those by Hardcastle & Worrall (2000) and\nWilson et al. (2006), bearing in mind that there is nearly an order\nof magnitude variation in external density, and therefore pressure,\nalong the lobes]. This allows us to model the lobes in the same way\nas for the previous two sources. However, there are two additional\ncomplications. One is that the photon energy density in the bright\nlobes of Cyg A is dominated by synchrotron photons, not CMB\nphotons; therefore the synchrotron self-Compton process is dominant, and the code of Hardcastle et al. (1998a), which assumes\nspherical symmetry, cannot give exact answers. We have verified\nusing a more sophisticated inverse-Compton code (Hardcastle et\nal. 2002), which by modelling the source using an arbitrarily fine\ngrid can account for the self-illumination of any source geometry\nat the cost of greatly increased computing time, that the correction\nfor a uniform ellipsoid is only of the order of 10 per cent, which is\nnegligible given the errors in the measured flux density. Secondly,\nhere we have a detection, rather than an upper limit, to deal with;\nthis means that, assuming pressure balance, we can actually measure one of the free parameters (\u03ba, p, etc) rather than setting limits\non it.\nBoth lobes are brighter than the prediction for IC at equipar-\n\ntition for \u03ba = 1, \u03b3min = 1 and p = 2, which is around 20 nJy.\nThus here we already know, without considering external pressure\nconstraints, that we expect the electron energy density to dominate\nover that of the field. However, the external pressure we use here\nexceeds by almost an order of magnitude the minimum pressure in\nthe lobes, which is of the order of 4 \u00d7 10\u221212 Pa for p = 2 [similar results have been found by Hardcastle & Worrall (2000) and by\nDunn & Fabian (2004)]. If we assume p = 2, \u03b3min = 1 and \u03ba = 0\nthen the electron density required if the lobes are to be in pressure\nbalance gives inverse-Compton emission that exceeds the observed\nvalue by a factor 5.5 (W lobe) to 2.4 (E lobe), and cannot be consistent even given the large errors; thus we cannot supply the missing\npressure with electrons alone for this p value. To make the prediction consistent with observation we require \u03ba \u2248 4 (W lobe) or 1 (E\nlobe), implying that non-radiating particles are either in rough energy equipartition with the electrons or dominant by a small factor.\nHowever, only modest increases in p are needed to restore pressure\nbalance and match the observed level of inverse-Compton emission\n(p = 2.2 \u2013 2.3). In these models the electrons still dominate the\nmagnetic field energy density by a large factor but no non-radiating\nparticles are required. For p \u2248 2.1 we could accommodate the\ninverse-Compton observations, obtain pressure balance and have\n\u03ba = 1. But unlike the situation in some FRIIs in poorer environments (e.g. Hardcastle et al. 2002, Croston et al. 2004), there does\nnot appear to be a possible sitation in which \u03ba = 0, p = 2 and both\nthe inverse-Compton and pressure balance constraints are satisfied\nwith B-fields close to the equipartition value if we assume that the\nsources is close to the plane of the sky. Projection would have some\neffect, but, as discussed above (and see Hardcastle & Worrall 2000\nfor more) the effect is not likely to be that large, especially for a\nsource, like Cygnus A, where the angle to the line of sight is likely\n\u25e6\nto be >\n\u223c 45 .\nFinally, it is worth commenting on the assumption of pressure\nbalance in the case of a powerful FRII like Cygnus A. Our implicit\nassumption throughout the discussion here and in other papers is\nthat the lobes are characterised by a single pressure, with a high\ninternal sound speed in the lobes acting to smooth out any pressure\ndifferences on a timescale that is short compared to the dynamical\ntime of the source. At the same time, FRIIs in general, and Cygnus\nA in particular, have external pressures that necessarily vary along\nthe length of the lobes; in Cygnus A's case, as noted above, this\nvariation is an order of magnitude in pressure terms. When discussing pressure balance of the lobes we are in fact talking about\npressure balance at (roughly) the mid-point of the lobe; the outer\nedge of the lobe in this case would have to be expanding and the inner edge contracting or, equivalently, moving outwards under buoyancy [the 'cocoon crushing' process discussed by Williams (1991)\nand Hardcastle & Worrall (2000)] if the midpoint were in pressure\nbalance. In fact, there is some evidence for mildly supersonic expansion even at the midpoint of the lobes of Cygnus A in the shape\nof the weak shocks argued for by Wilson et al.(2006). If these are\nshocks, then the pressure in the lobes should be equal to the pressure in the shocked gas, and using the values for the mass density\nin this region quoted by Wilson et al. in fact gives densities a factor\n2 lower than the value from Dunn et al., although clearly any inference of density in these regions is very geometry-dependent. The\nkey point, though, is that uncertainty is introduced into our constraints on particle content by the uncertain dynamical state of the\nlobes of the source. If we required the lobe to be expanding supersonically in all directions (which is certainly not supported by the\nobservations of Wilson et al. (2006)) then we would need to use\nexternal pressures corresponding to the central regions of the clus-\n\n\fIC emission from cluster radio galaxies\nTable 4.

Increasing \u03b3min reduces the lobe internal pressure for a given\nIC emissivity, while increasing p increases it. Our fiducial assumptions are p = 2.0, \u03b3min = 1 (though the latter neglects the possibility of Coulomb losses against any thermal particles present in the\nlobes, a process thought to operate effectively in supernova remnants; see, e.g., Vink 2008).\n\u2022 For a given choice of p and \u03b3min , and a value of \u03ba, the ratio\nbetween the energy densities of radiating and non-radiating particles, there are only two possible solutions for the magnetic field\nstrength, B, that allow us to achieve pressure balance given the\nobserved synchrotron emissivity in the radio (which sets the electron energy spectrum normalization). If we assume that particles\nare dominant, so that the lower value of B should always be the\none chosen, we can then constrain \u03ba by comparing the predicted\nand actual inverse-Compton emissivity. Increasing \u03ba decreases the\ninverse-Compton flux, so an upper limit on inverse-Compton flux\ncorresponds to a lower limit on \u03ba.\n\u2022 As shown in Table 4, for p = 2.0, \u03b3min = 1 we find \u03ba > 16\nfor the large-scale lobes of Hydra A, \u03ba > 3 for the lobes of Her A,\nand \u03ba = 1\u20134 for Cygnus A (where a statistically significant detection of excess hard emission from the lobes allows a measurement\nrather than a limit to be derived, although the errors are large). All\nthese values of \u03ba decrease if the assumed p is increased, but within\nthe limits set on p by radio observations \u03ba = 0 is not possible for\neither Hydra A or Her A. In other words, the electrons must contribute a small fraction of the total internal energy density in the\nFRI Hydra A and the intermediate source Her A, with the bulk of\nit, assuming particle dominance, being provided by a non-radiating\nparticle population. For the FRII Cygnus A, the electron content of\nthe lobes is close to the value required to provide pressure balance\nwith the external medium at the mid-point of the lobes without a\n\n9\n\ndominant contribution from non-radiating particles, but is insufficient to drive a strongly supersonic lobe expansion.\n\nIt has of course been known for a long time that solutions with\n\u03ba = 0 and B = Beq do not appear to be viable in the jets, lobes and\nplumes of FRI radio galaxies (e.g. Hardcastle et al. 2007 and references therein). In some cases the lack of detected inverse-Compton\nemission has been used to rule out a model in which the lobes are\nelectron-dominated (Hardcastle et al. 1998b, Croston et al. 2003)\nwhile the use of the external pressure and the radio fluxes to estimate a quantity equivalent to \u03ba is widespread (e.g. Dunn & Fabian\n2004). All previous attempts to estimate \u03ba in FRIs, though, rely\non some assumption about the magnetic field strength, normally\none equivalent to equipartition between the field and the particle\npopulation. The novelty of our work is that it demonstrates that\ninverse-Compton constraints can be used to remove the necessity\nfor this assumption; our values of \u03ba are not just a quantity that\ndepends on the ratio of minimum internal to external pressures,\nbut real measurements that incorporate all the available information. For models corresponding to the lower limits on \u03ba, we have\nUnon\u2212rad > Ue \u226b UB for Hydra A and Her A, though we emphasise that we have ruled out a priori magnetically dominated models,\nand the non-detections in inverse-Compton provide no additional\nevidence for that assumption.\nAn interesting feature of the existing constraints on pressure\nbalance in lobes has been the apparent difference between FRI and\nFRII sources found in earlier work. As discussed in Section 1, when\nthe magnetic field strengths are constrained using inverse-Compton\ndetections in FRIIs, the internal pressures are typically comparable\nto the external pressures with no additional non-radiating particles\nand only modest departures from equipartition (that is, solutions\nwith Ue > UB , Unon\u2212rad = 0 (\u03ba = 0) are implied, although\ntypically a contribution from non-radiating particles of order Ue\n(\u03ba \u2248 1) cannot be ruled out). In typical FRIs, by contrast, it seems\nthat solutions with Unon\u2212rad \u226b Ue (\u03ba \u226b 1) are required by the\ndata. Our result for Cyg A confuses this simple picture. Although\nwe appear to detect inverse-Compton emission, as in other FRIIs,\nand the implied electron energy densities are quite close to what\nwould be required to provide pressure balance, unlike the case for\nthe FRIs, the data do require some non-radiating particles and/or\na departure from our fiducial electron energy spectrum in order\nto allow pressure balance with the external environment. We emphasise that in general, and also in the specific case of Cyg A,\nthere are large uncertainties on inferences of electron energy densities from inverse-Compton observations, so that the differences\nbetween Cygnus A and other FRIIs may not be as significant as\nthey appear here. However, an intriguing possibility is that the apparent difference could be related to the very much richer environment of Cyg A when compared to other FRIIs that have been\nstudied with inverse-Compton observations. In FRIs, there is some\nevidence that the required non-radiating particle population may be\nrelated to entrainment (and subsequent efficient heating) of external material, since jetted sources like Hydra A tend to have larger\npressure deficits than lobed ones like Her A (Croston et al. 2008).\nConceivably the entrainment rates of the jets close to the centre of\nthe rich cluster environment of Cygnus A are high enough that the\nprocess operating in FRIs is also relevant there, so that there is an\nenvironmental dependence for lobe particle content both in FRIs\nand in FRIIs. The entrainment model for FRIs will be discussed in\ndetail in a forthcoming paper (Croston & Hardcastle, in prep.). For\nFRIIs, detailed testing of this idea must await observations capa-\n\n\f10\n\nM.J. Hardcastle & J.H. Croston\n\nble of detecting inverse-Compton emission in other sources in rich\nenvironments.\nThis work has demonstrated both the potential and the severe\ndifficulties of inverse-Compton studies of lobe particle content in\nthe presence of a hot thermal environment. The very large uncertainties on the inferred parameters even for such a bright inverseCompton source as Cygnus A, with such good X-ray data, make it\nclear that our technique is not likely to be applicable to less sensitive studies of more distant luminous FRIIs in clusters. The best\nresults were obtained for Hydra A, where the bubbles are large and\nthe surface brightness of thermal bremsstrahlung reasonably low;\nthere are almost certainly other well-studied large radio sources\nfor which inverse-Compton constraints would yield useful information. However, our work clearly highlights the current problems\nin making a spectral separation between inverse-Compton and thermal emission. To pin down the electron content in lobes in general,\nwe need the ability to image in somewhat harder X-rays, above the\ncutoff in thermal bremsstrahlung, with good sensitivity and moderate angular resolution. Hard X-ray imaging instruments such as the\nNuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), or, failing that,\nthe International X-ray Observatory (IXO) will eventually make\nthis possible.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nMJH thanks the Royal Society for a research fellowship.
