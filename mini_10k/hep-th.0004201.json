One can, for example, re-interpret lowerdimensional p-brane solitons as solutions of the ten-dimensional string, or eleven-dimensional\nM-theory. A crucial aspect of this picture is that the Kaluza-Klein reduction must be a\nconsistent one, in the sense that all solutions of the lower-dimensional theory must also\nbe solutions of the original higher-dimensional theory. This consistency is guaranteed in a\nstandard toroidal reduction, but it is far less clear-cut when a reduction on a manifold such\nas a sphere is considered.\nKaluza-Klein reductions on spheres are of great interest in the framework of string theory, because they can give rise to lower-dimensional gauged supergravities that are relevant\nfor discussing the AdS/CFT correspondence [1, 2, 3]. The generic structure of these gauged\nsupergravities comprises gravity coupled to a set of Yang-Mills gauge fields, and a set of\nscalar fields with a non-trivial potential, together, possibly, with additional antisymmetric\ntensor fields. A particular class of solution that can be studied is extremal domain walls,\nwhich can be viewed as charged black holes or black p-branes in the gauged theory, in\nthe extremal limit for which the electric or magnetic charges actually vanish. Thus these\nsolutions are supported entirely by the metric and certain scalar fields within the gauged\nsupergravity.\nIt therefore becomes of interest to study the circumstances under which a higherdimensional theory can admit a consistent n-sphere reduction in which just gravity and\nappropriate scalar fields are retained. In some cases this may be viewed as a subset of a\nlarger consistent reduction of a gauged supergravity, in which the starting point is supergravity in ten or eleven dimensions. However, the question can also be posed in a more\ngeneral framework, where the starting point need not necessarily even be a supersymmetric\ntheory.\nBefore discussing the possible new cases, let us review what is known at present. It is\nnatural, when considering an n-sphere reduction, to try to retain all the SO(n + 1) YangMills fields as part of the consistent reduction. Usually, however, this is not possible. It\nwas recently shown in [4, 5] that the cases where this can be done, starting from a Ddimensional theory of gravity, n-form field strength and dilaton, are as follows. One can\nstart with (D, n) = (11, 4), and reduce on S 4 or S 7 to seven or four dimensions respectively;\nanother possibility is to start from (D, n) = (10, 5), and reduce on S 5 to five dimensions. In\nthese cases, the system has no dilaton. Including a dilaton, with a specific coupling, one can\n1\n\n\falso start with n = 3 and D arbitrary, reducing on S 3 or S D\u22123 ; or finally one can start with\nn = 2 and D arbitrary, and reduce on S 2 . In all cases one must also include scalar fields Tij\nin the reduction Ansatz, corresponding to the coset SL(n + 1, IR)/SO(n + 1). Additionally,\nfor the S 4 reduction of D = 11 one must include five 3-form field strengths in the Ansatz,\nwhile for the S 7 reduction one must also include 35 more pseudoscalars.1 Finally, for the\nS 3 reduction in the n = 3 case, one must include a 3-form field strength in the reduction\nAnsatz.\nOur statement of the possible consistent reductions first specified that the SO(n + 1)\nYang-Mills gauge fields were to be included, and then we listed the additional fields that\nwould be needed for consistency. Another way of phrasing the question is to specify which\nscalar fields will be included in the reduction Ansatz. In fact if we want to include all\nthe scalars Tij of the SL(n + 1, IR)/SO(n + 1) coset, the list of cases where consistent\nreductions are possible will be the same as the above. The reason for this is that once all\nthe scalars Tij are present, they will act as sources for the Yang-Mills gauge fields, and so it\nwould be inconsistent to omit the Yang-Mills fields. However, if we settle for a reduction in\nwhich fewer scalars are retained, it becomes possible to omit the Yang-Mills fields and this\nopens up some further possibilities for consistent reductions, which we shall explore in this\npaper. These reductions with scalars but no gauge fields will be sufficient for the purpose\nof constructing the extremal domain-wall solutions in the lower dimension, and then lifting\nthem back to the higher dimension.\nAs mentioned above, if one includes the full set of scalars Tij in a truncation then they\nwill give rise to source terms that require the Yang-Mills fields to be non-zero. Specifically,\n\u22121\nthe source currents are of the form Tk[i\n\u2202\u03bc Tj]k , in the adjoint of SO(n + 1). If we make a\n\ntruncation where only the diagonal scalar fields are retained,\nTij = diag(X1 , X2 , . . . Xn+1 ) ,\n\n(1)\n\n\u22121\n\u2202\u03bc Tj]k will be zero, and thus there is no longer any necessity to include\nthen the currents Tk[i\n\nthe gauge fields in a consistent truncation. This actually allows a somewhat extended set\nof (D, n) values for which consistent reductions can be achieved, which includes cases that\nwould not allow consistent reductions with SO(n + 1) gauge fields. The allowed cases are\ndetailed below.\n1\n\nIn fact the consistent reductions from D = 11 require, in addition, the inclusion of the F F A in the\n\nLagrangian that arises in D = 11 supergravity. In the S 5 reduction from D = 10, it is necessary to impose\nthe requirement of self-duality on the 5-form field strength.\n\n2\n\n\fIn section 2 we construct an Ansatz for the n-sphere reduction of the a D-dimensional\ntheory of gravity, an n-form field strength, and a dilaton, in which the lower-dimensional\nfields comprise just gravity and the diagonal scalar fields given by (1). We obtain a complete proof of the consistency of this Kaluza-Klein reduction, showing that it works in all\ncases where the strength of the coupling of the dilaton to the n-form in D dimensions is\nappropriate. This requirement on the coupling is a rather stringent one, and the allowable\ncases turn out to be {n = 5, D \u2264 10}; {n = 4, D \u2264 11}; and n \u2264 3 with D arbitrary, for\nn \u2264 D/2.\nIn section 3 we construct (n + 1)-parameter extremal domain-wall solutions in the lowerdimensional theories of gravity plus scalar fields, and then make use of the reduction Ansatz\nderived in section 2 in order to lift these solutions back to the original D-dimensional\ntheory. We show that in the higher dimension the lifted solutions admit an interpretation\nas continuous distributions of (D \u2212 n \u2212 2)-branes. We discuss and obtain the distribution\nfunctions. We obtain the metric of the distributed branes in the dual frame, and show that\nthe structure of these metrics depends only on the dimension n of the internal sphere, but\nis independent of D. In particular, the metric in the dual frame becomes asymptotically\nAdS\u00d7S n for n 6= 3, and Minkowski\u00d7S 3 for n = 3.\nIn section 4 we analyse the spectrum of excitations of a minimally-coupled scalar in\nthe background of the (D \u2212 n)-dimensional domain-wall solution, showing that it has a\nuniversal structure that is characterised by the dimension n of the internal sphere used in\nthe dimensional reduction. In the case of the vacuum solutions, where the (n+1) parameters\nin the general solutions are all set to zero, the scalar wave equation can be solved explicitly,\nallowing a study of the singularity structure. We also analyse the Schr\u00f6dinger potentials\nfor generic cases, allowing us to determine the structures of the spectra in the various cases.\nIn an appendix, we show that a single-charge rotating p-brane in a generic dimension\ncan be dimensionally reduced on the internal (distorted) n-sphere to give rise to domainwall black holes with [(n + 1)/2] electric U (1) charges. In the extremal limit, the gauge\nfields vanish and the balck hole becomes a domain wall that is contained within the set of\nsolutions obtained in this paper.\n\n2\n\nKaluza-Klein sphere reduction\n\nSingle-charge p-branes in supergravity theories in D dimensions can be classified as solutions\nof the theory described by the Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to a dilaton and an n-form\n\n3\n\n\ffield strength,\nLD = R\u0302 \u02c6\n\u22171l \u2212 21 \u02c6\u2217d\u03c6\u0302 \u2227 d\u03c6\u0302 \u2212 21 ea\u03c6\u0302 \u02c6\u2217F\u0302(n) \u2227 F\u0302(n) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the constant a is given by [6]\na2 = 4 \u2212\n\n2(n \u2212 1)(D \u2212 n \u2212 1)\n.\nD\u22122\n\n(3)\n\nThe requirement that a be real puts a strong condition on the possible values for n, bearing\nin mind that we must have n \u2264 D, and in fact we can always choose a dualisation for F(n)\nfor which n \u2264 D/2. From (3), it then follows that the maximum value for n \u2264 D/2 is\n5. Whe n = 5, the maximal dimension is D = 10, corresponding to the self-dual 5-form\nin the type IIB theory. For n = 4, the maximal dimension is D = 11, corresponding to\n11-dimensional supergravity. In both cases, the constant a vanishes. For n = 0, 1, 2, 3, the\ndimension D can be arbitrary. Note that for a given n satisfying (3), n\u2032 = D \u2212 n satisfies\nit too. To summarise, the allowed possibilities are\n\nn = 0, 1, 2, 3 ,\n\nn = 5,\n\nD\u22125:\n\nD \u2264 10\n\nn = 4,\n\nD\u22124:\n\nD \u2265 11\n\nD, D \u2212 1, D \u2212 2, D \u2212 3 :\n\nD\n\narbitrary .\n\n(4)\n\nNote that these results come from the requirement only that a must be real. If in addition\nwe require that the Lagrangian must be associated with a supersymmetric theory, we get\nthe further restriction that the dimension D must be less than or equal to eleven or ten.\nThe p-branes for which the first term on the right-hand-side of (3) is 4 can be viewed\nas the basic building blocks for p-brane solitons. The p-branes with values other than 4,\n(usually 4/N with N an integer) can be viewed as bound states or intersections of these\nbuilding blocks. For example, for D = 11 and D = 10, our discussion applies to M-branes,\nthe NS-NS string and 5-brane and all the D-branes.\nWe shall now consider the Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction of the Lagrangian (2)\non S n . (The discussion of the reduction instead on S D\u2212n can be handled by dualising the\nn-form field strength to a (D \u2212 n)-form.) In general, such a reduction is inconsistent if\nwe keep all the massless fields. It was shown [4], however, that for n = 2 and n = 3 the\nreduction is always consistent, provided that (3) is satisfied. For n = 5 and n = 4, the\nreduction is consistent only if additional conditions are satisfied, namely self-duality of the\n5-form in D = 10, and the addition of an F F A term in D = 11 for the n = 4 case.\nIn this paper, we shall truncate further to a subset of the massless fields, corresponding\nto \"diagonal inhomogeneous distortions\" of the internal S n metric. By this, we mean that\n4\n\n\fwe canonically embed the sphere S n in n + 1 dimensional Euclidean space. The round S n\nmetric is given by d\u03bci d\u03bci , where \u03bci are Euclidean coordinates satisfying the unit-length\nconstraint \u03bci \u03bci = 1. The diagonal inhomogeneous distortion of the sphere is then achieved\nby introducing (n + 1) scalars Xi , and scaling the coordinate differentials as follows:\nds2n =\n\nX\n\nXi\u22121 (d\u03bci )2 .\n\n(5)\n\ni\n\nWe shall show that for this subset of fields, the Kaluza-Klein reduction is consistent for any\nof the D and n values listed in (4), provided that (3) is satisfied.\nWe find that the Kaluza-Klein reduction Ansatz is given by\nd\u015d2D\n\n=Y\n\n\u2212 a2 \u03c6\u0302\n\ne\n\n\u0010\n\n1\nD\u22122\n\n\u2206\n\n= \u2206\u22121 Y\n\nn\u22121\nD\u22122\n\nds2D\u2212n\n\n+g\n\n\u22122\n\n\u2206\n\n\u2212\n\n(D\u2212n\u22121)\n(D\u22122)\n\nn+1\nX\ni=1\n\n2(D\u2212n\u22121)\na2 (D\u22122)\n\n\u0011\n\nXi\u22121 (d\u03bci )2 ,\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nF\u0302(n) = g \u2212n+1 \u2206\u22122 U W + g \u2212n+1 \u2202\u03bd\n\n\u0010 X \u03bci \u0011\ni\n\n\u2206\n\ndx\u03bd \u2227 Zi .\n\nwhere\n\u03bci \u03bci = 1 ,\n\nY =\n\nY\n\nXi ,\n\n\u2206=\n\nX\n\nXi \u03bc2i ,\n\nU =2\n\nX\ni\n\nXi2 \u03bc2i \u2212 \u2206\n\nX\n\nXi .\n\n(7)\n\ni\n\nThe quantities W and Zi are respectively the volume-form on the n-sphere, and a certain\n(n \u2212 1)-form on the n-sphere:\n1\n\u01ebij ***j \u03bci d\u03bcj1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 d\u03bcjn ,\nn! 1 n\n1\nZi =\n\u01ebij ***j \u03bcj1 d\u03bcj2 \u2227 * * * \u2227 d\u03bcjn .\n(n \u2212 1)! 1 n\n\nW =\n\n(8)\n\nWe find after some algebra that the dual of the field strength F(n) is given by\n\u2217F(n) = g U \u01ebD\u2212n +\nea\u03c6\u0302 \u02c6\n\n1 \u22121\nX \u2217dXi \u2227 d(\u03bc2i ) .\n2g i\n\n(9)\n\nWe can then substitute the Ansatz into higher dimensional equations of motion.

The metrics in these cases become asymptotically-AdS\nspacetimes in seven, four and five dimensions. These AdS domain-wall solutions are sphere\nreductions of the decoupling limits of ellipsoidal distributions of M-branes and D3-branes.\nThese cases (and subsets) were studied previously in [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].\nIn this paper, we shall extend the previous analysis to include the cases where the\ndilaton-coupling constant a is non-vanishing. For these cases, the domain-wall metric (24)\nis no longer asymptotically AdS, but instead is asymptotic to a vacuum domain wall as\nr \u2192 \u221e, given by\nwhere \u03c1 \u223c (gr)\n\n4(n+1)\n\nds2d = \u03c1 a2 (D\u22122) dx\u03bc dx\u03bc + g\u22122 d\u03c12 .\n\na2 (D\u22122)\n4(d\u22122)\n\n(29)\n\n. This metric is flat as \u03c1 approaches at infinity.\n\nIn the region near r = 0, the metric structure depends on the number of non-vanishing\nparameters li . If k of the li are non-vanishing, we have\nds2d = \u03c1\u03b3 dx\u03bc dx\u03bc + d\u03c12 ,\n\n(30)\n\nwhere\n\na2 (D\u22122)+2(d\u22123)k\n4(n + 1 \u2212 k)\n4(d\u22122)\n,\n\u03c1\n=\n(gr)\n.\n(31)\na2 (D \u2212 2) + 2(d \u2212 3)k\nThus we see that at r = 0 = \u03c1, the solution is generic singular. To see if the singularity is\n\n\u03b3=\n\nnaked or not, we evaluate\n\u03b3 \u22122 =\n\n4(d \u2212 2)(n \u2212 3 \u2212 k)\n.\na2 (D \u2212 2) + 2(d \u2212 3)k\n9\n\n(32)\n\n\fThus for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, the solution has a naked singularity for all values of k. For n \u2265 4,\nthe singularity is naked for k > n \u2212 3, but marginal for k \u2264 n \u2212 3.\nIf we oxidise the solution back to D dimensions, it acquires an interpretation as a\ncontinuous distribution of (D \u2212 n \u2212 2)-branes, given by\nds2D = H\n\nn\u22121\n\u2212 D\u22122\n\n2\n\ndx\u03bc dx\u03bc + H\n\nD\u2212n\u22121\nD\u22122\n\ndy m dy m ,\n\nF(n) = e\u2212a\u03c6 \u02c6\u2217(dD\u2212n\u22121 x \u2227 dH \u22121 ) .\n\ne\u2212 a \u03c6 = H .\n\n(33)\n\nwhere H and the transverse Euclidean metric are given by\n1\n\ne dr 2 + r 2\ndy m dy m = h\u2212 2 \u2206\n\n1\n\nH =\n\ne\n(gr)n\u22121 \u2206\n\n,\n\nX\n\nHi d\u03bc2i ,\n1\n\ne = h2\n\u2206\n\nX \u03bc2\ni\n\nHi\n\n.\n\n(34)\n\nThe function H is a harmonic function of the Euclidean transverse space, and it can be\nexpressed as\nH=g\n\n\u2212(n\u22121)\n\nZ\n\n\u03c3(~y \u2032 ) dn+1 y \u2032\n,\n|~y \u2212 ~y \u2032 |n\u22121\n\n(35)\n\nwhere \u03c3(~y ) is the distribution function. The harmonic functions in our cases here are\nassociated with ellipsoidal distributions.\nA detailed analysis is given in [12], where the charge-distribution functions are obtained\nin the non-dilatonic cases of 3-branes in D = 10, and M2-branes and M5-branes in D = 11.\nThe analysis here is almost identical, and we shall not enumerate all the possibilities. It was\nobserved in [12] that although the results for the charge-distribution functions are distinctly\ndifferent depending upon how many of the li parameters are non-zero, by carefully taking\nlimits in which some of the parameters are sent to zero one can view them all as being derived\nfrom a maximally-degenerate case with all (n + 1) parameters non-zero. The distribution\nfunction with all the li non-vanishing is given by [12]\n\u03c3n+1 =\n\n1\n\nVn\n\nQn+1\ni=1\n\nwhere Vn is the volume of the n-sphere and\n\nli\n\u2032\n\n\u03b4\u2032 (1 \u2212\n\nn+1\nX\ni=1\n\nyi2\n),\nl2i\n\n(36)\n\nrefers to the derivative with respect to the\n\n\u03b4-function argument. This same charge distribution arises in our present cases, too.\nAs an example, let us consider what happens if one of the parameters, say ln+1 is sent to\n\u2032\nwill\nzero. It is clear from (36) that the integration in (35) over the associated direction yn+1\n\u2032\nclose to zero, and so the (n+1)-parameter\nbecome dominated by the contribution from yn+1\n\ncharge distribution \u03c3n+1 in the ln+1 \u2212\u2192 0 limit will become the n-parameter distribution\n\u03c3n (y1 , . . . , yn+1 ) = \u03b4(yn+1 )\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\n10\n\nd\u1ef9n+1 \u03c3n+1 (y1 , . . . , yn , \u1ef9n+1 ) .\n\n(37)\n\n\fEvaluating the integral, we obtain\n\u03c3n =\n\n1\n\n2 Vn\n\nQn\n\ni=1 li\n\n\u0010\n\n2(1 \u2212\n\nn\nX\nyi2\ni=1\n\n\u22121/2\n\u03b4(1 \u2212\n2)\n\nli\n\nn\nX\nyi2\ni=1\n\n2 ) \u2212 (1 \u2212\n\nli\n\nn\nX\nyi2\ni=1\n\n\u22123/2\n\u0398(1 \u2212\n2)\n\nli\n\nn\nX\nyi2 \u0011\ni=1\n\nl2i\n\n) \u03b4(yn+1 ) .\n(38)\n\nSending another parameter, say ln to zero, we next obtain the (n \u2212 1)-parameter charge\ndistribution\n\u03c3n\u22121 =\n\n\u03c0\n\nVn\n\nQn\u22121\ni=1\n\nli\n\n\u03b4(1 \u2212\n\nn\u22121\nX\ni=1\n\nyi2 (2)\n) \u03b4 (yn , yn+1 ) .\nl2i\n\n(39)\n\nFurther details of the successive results for smaller numbers k of non-vanishing parameters\nli are given in [12]. Note that the distributions associated with k = n + 1 and k = n\nnon-vanishing li parameters both have regions with negative as well as positive p-brane\ntensions. For k \u2264 n \u2212 1, on the other hand, the distributions contain only positive tensions.\nWhen all the parameters li vanish, corresponding to the \"vacuum\" domain-wall solution\nin d = D \u2212n dimensions, the D-dimensional solution describes coincident (D \u2212n\u22122)-branes\nat the origin, with the constant 1 in the harmonic function H dropped. This can be viewed\nas a certain decoupling limit. The metric of the solution in the Einstein frame can then be\nexpressed as\na\n\n\u0010\n\nds2E = e n\u22121 \u03c6 r n\u22123 dx\u03bc dx\u03bc +\n\n\u0011\ndr 2\n2\n+\nd\u03a9\n.\nn\nr2\n\n(40)\n\nOne can then define a dual frame ds2dual = e\u2212a\u03c6/(n\u22121) ds2E , in which the Lagrangian becomes\na(D\u22122)\n\nL = e e 2(n\u22121)\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u0010\n\nR+\n\n(D\u22122)(n2 \u2212n D\u2212n+3D\u22122)\n2(n\u22121)2\n\n(\u2202\u03c6)2 \u2212\n\n1\n2n!\n\n\u0011\n\n2\nF(n)\n.\n\n(41)\n\nIn this dual frame, the metric is AdS\u00d7S n if n 6= 3, and Minkowski\u00d7S 3 when n = 3. This\nanalysis was given in detail in [14] for D = 10, leading to the conjecture of a Domainwall/QFT correspondence. Further studies of the Domain-wall/QFT correspondence in\ngeneral dimensions were given in [15].\nIt is of interest to note that in the dual frame, the metric depends only on the dimension\nn of the internal sphere, but it is independent of D; the D-dependence of the Einsteinframe metric can all extracted as a conformal factor. Note that the dual frame metric has\nqualitative differences in the three situations n > 3, n = 3 and n < 3. For n = 3, the\ndual frame is Minkowskian, whilst for n 6= 3, the spacetime is AdS. However, for n > 3 we\nhave that r = 0 is the horizon, whilst for n < 3 the horizon is instead at r = \u221e. These\nqualitative differences have significance for the structure of the spectrum in the dual QFT,\nwhich we shall analyse in the next section.\nWhen the li parameters are non-vanishing, the metric of the distributed branes in the\n\n11\n\n\fdual frame is given by\n2\n\nn\u22123\n\ne n\u22121 ds2 + g \u22122 \u2206\ne n\u22121\nds2dual = \u2206\nd\n\nwhere\nds2d = (gr)n\u22123 dx\u03bc dx\u03bc +\n\nX\n\nHi2 d\u03bc2i ,\n\ndr 2\n1\n\n.\n\n(42)\n\n(43)\n\n(gr)2 h 2\n\nAgain we see that the metric does not manifestly depend on D, but on n instead.\n\n4\n\nAnalysis of the spectrum\n\nA minimally-coupled scalar field \u03a6 obeys the wave equation\n\u221a\n\u2202\u03bc ( \u2212g g \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd \u03a6) = 0 .\n\n(44)\n\nWe make the Ansatz \u03a6 = eip*x \u03c7(r), where m2 = \u2212p*p determines the mass of the fluctuating\nmode, and so the wave equation has the following general form\nh\n\nr \u22121 \u2202r r \u22121\n\nn+1\nYq\ni=1\n\ni\n\nr 2 + l2i \u2202r \u03c7 = \u2212Q \u03c7 ,\n\n(45)\n\n1\n\nwhere Q = m2 g\u2212 2 (n+1) . Remarkably, the wave equation depends only on the dimension of\nthe internal sphere, but otherwise is independent of details of the original higher-dimensional\ntheory.\nIt is helpful to cast the wave equation into the Schr\u00f6dinger form, which can be done by\nfirst writing the metric in a manifestly conformally-flat frame as\nds2 = e2A(z) (dx\u03bc dx\u03bc + dz 2 ) ,\n\n(46)\n\nby means of an appropriate coordinate transformation. The coordinate z runs from 0 to z \u2217 ,\nand A(z) has the following asymptotic behaviour:\n2(n + 1)\nfor z \u2192 z \u2217 ,\n(d \u2212 2)(n \u2212 3)\n2\u03b3\n2(n + 1 \u2212 k)\n\u03b3\u0303 =\n=\u2212\n, for z \u2192 0 .\n2\u2212\u03b3\n(d \u2212 2)(n \u2212 3 \u2212 k)\n\ne2A \u223c (z \u2212 z \u2217 )\u03b3 ,\n\u2217\n\ne2A \u223c z \u03b3\u0303 ,\n\n\u03b3\u2217 = \u2212\n\n(47)\n\nMaking the field redefinition \u03c7 = e\u2212(D\u22122)A/2 \u03c8, the wave equation assumes the form\n(\u2212\u2202 2 \u2212 V ) \u03c8 = 41 Q \u03c8 ,\n\n(48)\n\nwith the Schr\u00f6dinger potential given by\nV =\n\nd \u2212 2 \u2032\u2032 (d \u2212 2)2 \u2032 2\nA +\n(A ) .\n2\n4\n12\n\n(49)\n\n\fThe asymptotic behavior of the potential is given by\nV\n\n\u223c\n\nV\n\n\u223c\n\nwhere\n\nc\u2217\n,\n(z \u2212 z \u2217 )2\nc\n,\n(z \u2212 z\u0303)2\n\nz \u2192 z\u2217 ,\n\nfor\nfor\n\nz \u2192 z\u0303 ,\n\n(50)\n\n(n \u2212 1)2\n(n \u2212 1 \u2212 k)2\n1\n,\nc\n=\n\u2212\n\u2265 \u2212 14 .\n+\n(51)\n4\n(n \u2212 3)2\n(n \u2212 3 \u2212 k)2\nThe range of the coordinate z is determined by the values of z \u2217 and z\u0303, which in the original\nc\u2217 = \u2212 41 +\n\ncoordinate r correspond to r \u2192 \u221e and r \u2192 0 limit, respectively. It is understood that if\nz \u2217 or z\u0303 equals \u00b1\u221e, the potential in (50) is of the form \u00b11/z 2 .\n\nNote that for n \u2264 3 [n \u2265 4] the limit r \u2192 \u221e corresponds to z \u2192 z \u2217 with z \u2217 = \u221e\n\n[z \u2217 = finite]. On the other hand for n \u2212 k \u2264 3 [n \u2212 k \u2265 4] the limit r \u2192 0 corresponds\nto z \u2192 z\u0303 where z\u0303 = 0 [z\u0303 = \u2212\u221e]. When n = 3 or k = n \u2212 3, where the denominator\nof the above expression vanishes, the coordinate z depends logarithmically on the original\ncoordinate r (z \u223c log(r)) and the Schr\u00f6dinger potential becomes constant: V = 1/4.\nNote that since the wave equation is independent of D, whilst the metric depends on D,\nit may be more instructive to perform a field redefinition directly on the wave equation (45).\nThis can be done by first defining y = r 2 , and then introducing a new coordinate z defined\nby \u2202y/\u2202z =\n\np\n\nQn+1\n\nf (y), where f (y) = [\n\ni=1\n\n(y + l2i )]1/2 . (These are the defining equations that\n\nrelate z and r coordinates.) The Schr\u00f6dinger potential is then given by [12]\nV = 14 \u2202z2 log f +\n\n1\n16 (\u2202z\n\nlog f )2 .\n\n(52)\n\nand it clearly depends on n and li (i = 1, * * * , k) only.\n\n4.1\n\nVacuum excitations\n\nWhen all the parameters li vanish, the solution (24) becomes a domain-wall vacuum solution. In the case when a2 = 0, which occurs for (D, n) = (11, 7), (10, 5) and (11, 4), the\nsolution is just the AdS spacetime in d = 4, 5 and 7 respectively. For a2 6= 0, the metric of\nthe solution is (30). The metric is flat near \u03c1 = \u221e, but becomes singular as \u03c1 approaches\nzero. Since we have\n4(n + 1)\n4(d \u2212 2)(n \u2212 3)\n\u22122=\n,\n2\na (D \u2212 2)\na2 (D \u2212 2)\nthe singularity is marginal for n \u2265 3, but naked for n < 3.\n\n(53)\n\nThe characteristics of the Schr\u00f6dinger potential depend only the value of n. For n =\n0, 1, 2, the potential is given by\nV =\n\nc\u2217\n,\nz2\n\n13\n\n(54)\n\n\fwhere c\u2217 is given in (51). The coordinate z runs from 0 to infinity as r runs from 0 to\ninfinity. For n = 3, the potential is a constant, V = 1/4, and the coordinate z runs from\nminus infinity to infinity as r runs from 0 to infinity. For n \u2265 4, the potential is of the same\nform as (54), but the coordinate z now runs from minus infinity to 0 as r runs from 0 to\ninfinity. Thus we see that although the domain-wall vacuum can have (naked) singularities,\nthe quantum fluctuations are nevertheless well behaved. In fact it is straightforward to\nsolve the minimally-coupled scalar wave equation in the domain-wall vacuum, namely\nr \u22121 \u2202r (r n \u2202r \u03c7) = \u2212Q \u03c7 .\n\n(55)\n\nIf we define a new dependent variable y by\n\u03c7(r) = y(r) r \u2212(n\u22121)/2 ,\n\n(56)\n\nand change to the new independent variable z defined by\n\u221a\n2 Q \u2212(n\u22123)/2\nz=\nr\n,\nn\u22123\n\n(57)\n\nthen the wave equation (55) becomes the Bessel equation\nz 2 y \u2032\u2032 (z) + z y \u2032 (z) + (z 2 \u2212 \u03bd 2 ) y(z) = 0 ,\n\n(58)\n\nwhere\n\u03bd=\n\nn\u22121\n.\nn\u22123\n\n(59)\n\nThe solutions to (55) are therefore given by\n\u0010 2\u221aQ\n\u0010 2\u221aQ\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u2212(n\u22121)/2\n\u2212(n\u22123)/2\n\u2212(n\u22121)/2\n\u03c7(r) = a r\nJ\u03bd\nr\nr \u2212(n\u22123)/2 .\n+ br\nY\u03bd\nn\u22123\nn\u22123\n\n(60)\n\nA special case arises for n = 3 (the Schr\u00f6dinger potential is constant, V = 1/4, there) for\nwhich we find\n\u03c7(r) = a r \u22121+i\n\n\u221a\n\nQ\u22121\n\n+ b r \u22121\u2212i\n\n\u221a\n\nQ\u22121\n\n.\n\n(61)\n\nThe requirement that Q \u2265 1 corresponds to the condition that there is an energy gap.\n\n4.2\n\nDomain-wall excitations\n\nWhen some of the li parameters are non-vanishing, the wave equations cannot in general be\nsolved explicitly. Here, for simplicity, we shall consider the case where all the non-vanishing\nli are equal. There are certain examples where the wave equations can be solved exactly.\nTwo of these (n = 5, k = 2 with two equal charges li , and n = 5, k = 4 with four equal\n14\n\n\fcharges) are solved in [9]. Another solvable example is n = 3, k = 2, with the two nonvanishing charges equal, say l1 = l2 \u2261 l. In this case, if we let x = \u2212r 2 /l2 , equation (45)\nbecomes the hypergeometric equation\nx(1 \u2212 x) \u03c7\u2032\u2032 + (1 \u2212 2x) \u03c7\u2032 \u2212 14 Q \u03c7 = 0 ,\n\n(62)\n\nand so one solution gives\n\u03c71 = 2 F1 [a, b; 1; \u2212\n\nr2\n],\nl2\n\na=\n\n1\n2\n\n+\n\ni\n2\n\n\u221a\n\nQ \u2212 1,\n\nb=\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2212\n\ni\n2\n\n\u221a\n\nQ\u2212 1.\n\n(63)\n\nNote again that Q > 1 corresponds to the condition that the (continuous) spectrum has a\ngap owing to the properties of the Schr\u00f6dinger potential V \u2265 1/4 (figure g). Note that at\nsmall r we therefore have \u03c71 \u223c 1, while at large r the asymptotic behaviour is of the same\nform as in (61). Since the c argument of the hypergeometric function 2 F1 [a, b; c; x] in (63) is\nan integer, the second solution \u03c72 of (62) must be obtained by taking an appropriate limit\nof the standard second solution x1\u2212c 2 F1 [a \u2212 c + 1, b \u2212 c + 1; 2 \u2212 c; x]. This gives a logarithmic\nbehaviour of the form \u03c72 \u223c log r at small r.\nFor the remaining examples, although we cannot solve the wave equation analytically\nwe can determine the structure of the spectra for the various cases from the forms of their\nSchr\u00f6dinger potentials.

Provided that the dilaton has a\nspecific strength of coupling to the n-form, given by (3), we have proven the consistency of\nthe non-linear Kaluza-Klein Ansatz for the n-sphere reduction in which there are n scalars\nparameterising right-ellipsoidal inhomogeneous deformations of the sphere.2\n2\n\nWe did not turn on the Kaluza-Klein gauge-fields in the reduction, which corresponds to a consistent\n\ntruncation of the theory. However in the appendix we also discuss an n-sphere reduction of this Lagrangian\nthat corresponds to making pair-wise identifications of the diagonal scalar fields, together with turning\non the electric components of the Abelian Kaluza-Klein fields. This reduction provides a D-dimensional\nembedding of the (D \u2212 n)-dimensional non-extreme (large) charged-black holes as (near-extreme) spinning\nelectric (D \u2212 n \u2212 2)-branes. In the BPS limit the charged black holes become neutral BPS domain-wall\n\n16\n\n\fThe generality of these consistent reductions provides a framework within which we\ncan address the D-dimensional embedding of a class of solutions of the reduced gauged\nsupergravities in d = D \u2212 n dimensions. In general, these gauged supergravities have\npotentials for the scalar fields that do not admit AdS ground-states, and thus in general,\nthe typical solutions correspond to domain walls that are asymptotic to the \"dilatonic\"\nvacuum. In particular, we found the general class of BPS domain-wall solutions that are\nspecified by k = {1, * * * , n} parameters, which characterise the harmonic functions of k\nnon-trivial scalars.\nAll these solutions have explicit representations as continuous distributions of extremal\n(D \u2212 n \u2212 2)-branes, and thus in the context of the Domain-wall/QFT correspondence they\ndescribe the Coulomb phase of the dual strongly-coupled field theory.\nThe universal properties of these gravity solutions manifest themselves in the properties\nof the wave equations in these backgrounds. For minimally-coupled scalars, the wave equations are completely universal and depend only on the dimension n of the compactifying\nsphere and the number k of parameters in the harmonic functions specifying the non-trivial\nscalar fields. Remarkably, the wave equations are independent of the original dimension D.\nThus in the dual field theory the bound-state spectrum is completely specified by n and k.\nWe gave an analysis of the spectra for all these cases.\nOne of the interesting outcomes of our study is the generality and universality of the BPS\nsolutions for the specific subsector of the sphere-reduced gravity theories. This provides a\nstrong indication that the dual field theories should exhibit the same intriguing features,\nirrespective of the dimension.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe should like to thank K.

In this appendix, we show that\nsuch a rotating p-brane associated with a given by (3) can be dimensionally reduced on\nthe transverse spherical space, and it then gives rise to a domain-wall black hole in the\nlower dimension. The Lagrangian (2) admits an electric (d \u2212 1)-brane with d = n \u2212 1, or a\nsolutions.\n\n17\n\n\fmagnetic (d \u2212 1)-brane with d = D \u2212 n \u2212 1. We shall consider only the magnetic solution\nhere, since the electric one can be viewed as a magnetic solution of the dual (D \u2212 n)-form\nfield strength F(D\u2212n) .

It can be\nviewed as a modification of the general consistent metric Ansatz in (6) in which we first\n(consistently) partially truncate the scalars by setting them equal in pairs (X1 = X2 = X\u03041 ,\n \u0307 Then, having also made the redefinitions (67), we introduce a U (1)\nX3 = X4 = X\u03042 , etc).\ngauge field Ai(1) associated with the rotation in each of the original 2-planes (\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 ), (\u03bc3 , \u03bc4 ),\netc. (Although we have not presented it here, we can also straightforwardly carry out the\nsame steps on the original Ans\u00e4tze for \u03c6\u0302 and F\u0302(n) in (6) too.) This does give a consistent\nreduction in the case (10, 5) discussed in [16], but in general additional fields would have to\nbe included too. The reason for this is that the U (1) gauge fields, in quadratic products of\ni \u2227 F j , will act as sources for other fields. In the special case of (D, n) = (10, 5),\nthe form F(2)\n(2)\n\nthey actually act as sources for themselves (corresponding to cubic Chern-Simons terms in\nthe five-dimensional theory), but in the other cases they will act as sources for additional\nfields, requiring a larger set of fields in the Kaluza-Klein reduction Ansatz.\nThe metric (69), together with analogously-obtained expressions for \u03c6\u0302 and F\u0302(n) , is neveri \u2227 F j actually\ntheless still usable in appropriate circumstances. The problematic terms F(2)\n(2)\n\nvanish for our specific domain-wall black hole solutions since all the U (1) charges are purely\nelectric. This means that these particular lower-dimensional configurations will lift to the\nhigher dimension without necessitating the turning-on of the additional fields that would be\nneeded for a fully-consistent Ansatz, but which have been omitted in our discussion. Thus\nwe still have an exact embedding of these specific solutions in the higher dimension.\n\n19\n\n\fCase 2: n = 2N\nHere, the solution has the same form as (64), but with the range of the index i extended\nto include 0. However, there is no angular momentum parameter or azimuthal coordinate\nassociated with the extra index value, and so l0 = 0 and \u03c60 = 0. The \u03bc\u0303i and \u03c6i coordinates\nare now related to the original coordinates \u03bci on the sphere by\n\u03bc0 = \u03bc\u03030 ,\n\n\u03bc1 + i \u03bc2 = \u03bc\u03031 ei \u03c61 ,\n\n\u03bc3 + i \u03bc4 = \u03bc\u03032 ei \u03c62 ,\n\netc.\n\n(71)\n\nOtherwise, all the formulae in Case 1 generalise to this case, simply by extending the\nsummation to span the range 0 \u2264 i \u2264 N . Of course H0 = 1 as a consequence of l0 = 0.\nNote that for a = 0, we have (D, n) = (11, 7), (11, 4) and (10, 5). These correspond to\nthe rotating M-branes [17, 16] and D3-branes [8, 18, 16].\n\nReferences\n[1] J. Maldacena, The large N limit of superconformal field theories and supergravity,\nAdv. Theor. Math.
