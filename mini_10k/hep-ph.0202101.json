The slepton mass problem characteristic\nof the scenario is resolved, and the fermion mass hierarchy is explained via the FroggattNielsen mechanism. FCNC problems are evaded by a combination of universal doublet\ncharges and Yukawa textures which are diagonalised by transforming the left-handed fields\nonly.\n\nFeb 2002\n\n\fRecently there has been interest in a specific and predictive framework for the origin\nof soft supersymmetry breaking within the MSSM, known as Anomaly Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (AMSB) [1] \u2013[34]. Direct application of the AMSB solution to the\nMSSM leads, unfortunately, to negative (mass)2 sleptons. A number of possible solutions\nto this problem have been discussed; here we concentrate on a proposal by two of us[13]\n(see also [26]); namely the introduction of Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) terms associated with both\nthe MSSM U1 and an additional U1\u2032 symmetry. This preserves the exact RG invariance\nof the AMSB solution in rather a minimalist way, requiring as it does the introduction\nof no new fields; the U1\u2032 need not in fact be gauged, though the RG invariance requires\nthat we ensure that it has vanishing linear mixed anomalies with the MSSM gauge group.\nThe MSSM indeed admits two generation-independent, mixed-anomaly-free U1 groups, the\nexisting U1Y and another (which could be chosen to be U1B\u2212L [26], or a linear combination\nof it and U1Y ).\nExtension of this scenario to include massive neutrinos meets an obstacle inasmuch as\nthere is no flavour independent global U1\u2032 symmetry possible for a superpotential incorporating both neutrino Yukawa couplings and Majorana masses for right-handed neutrinos.\nWe are therefore driven to consider flavour dependent symmetries1 , and choose to make\na virtue out of necessity in this regard by re-examining the well-travelled path of Yukawa\ncoupling textures associated with a U1 symmetry [35]. Most of the (considerable) literature on this subject has dealt with an anomalous U1\u2032 (with anomaly cancellation finally\nachieved via the Green-Schwarz mechanism [36]). This route is not open to us, however,\nas we require cancellation of the mixed gauge-U1\u2032 anomalies. We believe, however, that the\nconclusion that texture generation via an anomaly-free U1\u2032 is impossible is a consequence of\nassumptions which, while plausible, are not strictly necessary (what constitutes necessity\nbeing in these matters, we admit, a question of taste).\nThus our goal is to show that the MSSM with massive neutrinos (which we will call\nthe MSSM\u03bd ) admits a global U1\u2032 which enables us to solve the AMSB tachyonic slepton\nproblem while simultaneously reproducing the well-known hierarchies [37]\nm\u03c4 : m\u03bc : me = mb : ms : md = 1 : \u03bb2 : \u03bb4 ,\nwhere \u03bb \u2248 0.22.\n1\n\nfor some alternative ideas see Ref. [26]\n\n2\n\nand\n\nmt : mc : mu = 1 : \u03bb4 : \u03bb8 ,\n\n(1)\n\n\fWe will assume that Yukawa terms are generated via the Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism[35]: specifically, from higher dimension terms involving MSSM\u03bd singlet fields \u03b8t,b,\u03c4\nwith each \u03b8 associated with a particular Yukawa matrix, via terms such as H2 Qi tcj ( M\u03b8tU )aij ,\nwhere MU represents the scale of new physics. Then if we require Yukawa textures consistent with the above hierarchies, and also require that the mixed anomalies cancel, we are\nin general led to consider different charges for each of \u03b8t,b,\u03c4 . If we choose \u03b8-charges\nq\u03b8t = \u22121,\n\nq\u03b8b = 2 \u2212\n\n\u2206\n2,\n\nq\u03b8\u03c4 = 2 \u2212\n\n\u2206\n3,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u2206 = h1 + h2 , and the charge assignments shown in Table 1,\n\nQi\n\ntc2\n\ntc3\n\nbc1\n\nbc2\n\nbc3\n\n8 \u2212 tc1 \u2212 h2\n\ntc1 \u2212 4\n\ntc1 \u2212 8\n\n3h2 + h1 + tc1 \u2212 16\n\n2h2 + tc1 \u2212 12\n\ntc1 \u2212 h1 + h2 \u2212 8\n\n\u03c41c\n\nLi\n2\n3 h1\n\n3tc1 \u2212 31 h1 + 83 h2 \u2212 24\n\n\u2212 34 h2 + 16 \u2212 3tc1\n\n\u03c42c\n\n\u03c43c\n\n20 \u2212 2h2 \u2212 3tc1\n\n24 \u2212 23 h1 \u2212 83 h2 \u2212 3tc1\n\nTable 1: The U1\u2032 -charges\nthen the mixed anomalies cancel and we find textures given by\n\u03bb8\nYt \u223c \uf8ed \u03bb8\n\u03bb8\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03bb4\n\u03bb4\n\u03bb4\n\n\uf8f6\n1\n1\uf8f8,\n1\n\n\u03bb4\nYb \u223c \uf8ed \u03bb4\n\u03bb4\n\n\u03bb2\n\u03bb2\n\u03bb2\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n1\n1\uf8f8,\n1\n\n\u03bb4\nY\u03c4 \u223c \uf8ed \u03bb4\n\u03bb4\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03bb2\n\u03bb2\n\u03bb2\n\n\uf8f6\n1\n1\uf8f8,\n1\n\n(3)\n\nwhere we assume h\u03b8t,b,\u03c4 i/MU \u2248 \u03bb \u2248 0.22. The powers of \u03bb are determined by relations\n\nsuch as h1 + Qi + bc1 + 4q\u03b8b = 0. The equality of the rows in each matrix corresponds to\n\ngeneration independent doublet charges Qi and Li . (We use the same notation for the\nfield and its U1\u2032 charge; it should be clear from the context which is intended.)\nTextures of this form have in fact been considered before in the context of D-branes\n[38], and termed \"single right-handed democracy\". It is easy to show that the eigenvalues\nof Yt,b,\u03c4 above lead to the mass textures of Eq. (1). Another feature of textures of this\ngeneric form is that since to a good approximation we have\n\uf8eb\n\n0 0\nYtT Yt \u223c \uf8ed 0 0\n0 0\n3\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\uf8f8\n1\n\n(4)\n\n\f(similarly for Yb,\u03c4 ) it is evident that the rotation on the RH fields required to diagonalise\nthe mass matrix will be of the generic form\n\uf8eb\ncos \u03b1\nUR \u223c \uf8ed \u2212 sin \u03b1\n0\n\n\uf8f6\nsin \u03b1 0\ncos \u03b1 0 \uf8f8 .\n0\n1\n\n(5)\n\nMoreover, by considering the specific textures shown in Eq. (3) in the approximation that\nwe set to zero the first column of each matrix it is easy to show that in our case UR will\nalways be close to the unit matrix[38]. This will be significant later when we consider\nflavour changing neutral currents (FCNCs). If we assume the\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nat \u03bb8 dt \u03bb4 1 + O(\u03bb2 )\nab \u03bb4\nYt \u221d \uf8ed bt \u03bb8 et \u03bb4 1 + O(\u03bb2 ) \uf8f8 and Yb \u221d \uf8ed bb \u03bb4\nct \u03bb8 ft \u03bb4 1 + O(\u03bb2 )\ncb \u03bb4\n\nspecific forms\ndb \u03bb2\neb \u03bb2\nfb \u03bb2\n\nthen we obtain for the CKM matrix the texture\n\uf8eb\n1\n1\n\uf8ed\n1\n1\nCKM \u223c\n\u03bb2 \u03bb2\n\n\uf8f6\n\u03bb2\n\u03bb2 \uf8f8\n1\n\nwhich is not of the form of the standard Wolfenstein\n\uf8eb\n1 \u03bb\n\uf8ed\n\u03bb 1\nCKMW \u223c\n\u03bb3 \u03bb2\n\nparametrisation,\n\uf8f6\n\u03bb3\n\u03bb2 \uf8f8\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n1 + O(\u03bb2 )\n1 + O(\u03bb2 ) \uf8f8\n1 + O(\u03bb2 )\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nIt does, however, reproduce the most significant feature, which is the smallness of the\ncouplings to the third generation.\n\n2\n\nIt follows that it is possible to exhibit explicit forms\n\nof Yt , Yb with \"reasonable\" coefficients reproducing the observed CKM matrix, for example:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n11.35\u03bb8 0.915\u03bb4 1.048\n0.487\u03bb4\n0.281\u03bb2 1.063\nYt \u221d \uf8ed 1.244\u03bb8 3.336\u03bb4 0.970 \uf8f8 Yb \u221d \uf8ed \u22121.311\u03bb4 0.398\u03bb2 1.008 \uf8f8 .\n(9)\n8\n4\n4\n2\n3.362\u03bb \u22124.266\u03bb 0.980\n\u22120.514\u03bb \u22120.750\u03bb 0.925\nThe ub and td entries in the CKM matrix are comparatively sensitive to changes in the\ncoefficients in Eq. (9), because our texture form, Eq. (6), does not naturally explain the\nfactor of 10 difference between these entries and the cb and ts ones.\n2\n\nWe disagree somewhat with Ref. [38], where it is asserted that the Wolfenstein texture follows\n\nif we replace the (13) elements of both Yt and Yb in Eq. (6) by 1 + O(\u03bb). With this particular\nform for Yt,b it is straightforward to establish (by either numerical or analytic means) that the\nCKM matrix would have a texture similar to Eq. (7) but with \u03bb2 replaced everywhere by \u03bb.\n\n4\n\n\fThe charges shown in Table 1 have been chosen to provide cancellation of the mixed\nU1\u2032 (SU3 )2 ,\n\nU1\u2032 (SU2 )2 , and U1\u2032 (U1 )2 anomalies. This is what is required to render our scalar\n\nmass solution RG invariant; but it is also of interest to examine the remaining anomalies involving U1\u2032 . The (U1\u2032 )2 U1 , (U1\u2032 )3 and (U1\u2032 )-gravitational anomalies are proportional\nrespectively to\n\u0002\nAQ = \u2206 8h2 + 6tc1 \u2212\nAC = \u2212108tc1 \u2206h2 \u2212 2368\u2206 \u2212\n+ 16tc1 \u22062 \u2212 54(tc1 )2 \u2206 +\n\n632 2\n3 \u2206\n\n224\n3\n\n+\n\n14\n9 \u2206\n\n\u0003\n\n,\n\n+ 640\u2206h2 + 816tc1 \u2206 +\n\n(10)\n\n2\n92\n3 h2 \u2206\n\n\u2212 48\u2206h22\n\n16 3\n9 \u2206\n\n(11)\n\n+ 3(9(tc1 )2 \u2212 168tc1 + 24h2 tc1 + 16h22 + 816 \u2212 224h2 )(3tc1 + 4h2 \u2212 28),\nand\nAG = 3(3tc1 + 4h2 \u2212 28).\n\n(12)\n\nNote that there will be additional contributions to AG and AC from any MSSM\u03bd singlet\nfields with U1\u2032 charges, such as, of course, the \u03b8-fields introduced above, unless they are\naccompanied by oppositely charged partners. In the specific case of the \u03b8-fields, such \u03b8partners (if they exist) must be forbidden from generating textures in order to preserve\nthe patterns of Eq. (3). One reason for assuming the \u03b8s exist is that unless they do (and\nhave vevs approximately equal to the corresponding \u03b8s) then the quadratic D-terms for\nthe U1\u2032 (if it is gauged) will generate large masses for all the MSSM\u03bd fields [39]. The\npossible generation of weak-scale contributions to the sparticle masses via this route and\ntheir impact on flavour-changing processes was discussed recently in Ref. [40].\nFor our purpose it is not necessary to gauge U1\u2032 , or remove its anomalies other than\nthe linear mixed ones; let us, however, explore (en passant) the option of rendering it\ncompletely anomaly-free. It is easy to show that the conditions\n\u2206=0\n\nand\n\n3tc1 + 4h2 \u2212 28 = 0\n\n(13)\n\nare necessary and sufficient to give AQ = AC = AG = 0 above. (Cancellation of all\nthe anomalies requires the existence of the \u03b8-partners \u03b8 as described above; if the \u03b8contributions in AC and AG are not cancelled, it is straightforward to show there is no\ncharge assignment such that AQ = AC = AG = 0.) The solution Eq. (13) may be of\ninterest in the non-AMSB context, providing as it does a fully anomaly free U1\u2032 (and one\n5\n\n\fwhich would remain anomaly-free with the introduction of SU3 \u2297 SU2 \u2297 U1 singlets in \u00b1\n\npairs). However it turns out that we cannot with these conditions resolve the slepton mass\nproblem, as we shall now show.\nIncluding the FI contributions the scalar masses are given by[13]\nm2Q = m2Q + 16 \u03b61 + \u03b62 Qi \u03b4ji ,\n\nm2tc = m2tc \u2212 23 \u03b61 + \u03b62 tci \u03b4ji ,\n\nm2bc = m2bc + 13 \u03b61 + \u03b62 bci \u03b4ji ,\n\nm2L = m2L \u2212 12 \u03b61 + \u03b62 Li \u03b4ji ,\n\nm2\u03c4 c = m2\u03c4 c + \u03b61 + \u03b62 \u03c4ic \u03b4ji ,\n\nm2H1 = m2H1 \u2212 12 \u03b61 + \u03b62 h1 ,\n\n(14)\n\nm2H2 = m2H2 + 12 \u03b61 + \u03b62 h2\nwhere \u03b61,2 are constants and where m2Q , * * * denote the AMSB contributions. For exam-\n\nple[1]-[3],\n\n(m2Q )i j = 12 |m0 |2 \u03bc\n\nd(\u03b3Q )i j\n,\nd\u03bc\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03b3Q is the quark doublet anomalous dimension matrix and m0 is the gravitino mass.\nThe slepton mass problem is the fact that m2L and m2\u03c4 c have negative eigenvalues. However,\nas we shall see, we can choose U1\u2032 charges so that for some region of \u03b61,2 parameter space,\nthe eigenvalues of m2L and m2\u03c4 c are all positive, and indeed we obtain a fully realistic mass\nspectrum.\nIn fact, it is easily shown that with the charge assignments shown in Table 1, and\n\u2206 = 0, there exists some range of \u03b61,2 leading to positive FI contributions for both m2\u03c4 c\nand m2L if and only if\n3tc1 + 4h2 < 24\n\nor 3tc1 + 4h2 > 32,\n\n(16)\n\nso that the fully anomaly-free solution Eq. (13) is excluded. We will nevertheless choose\nto impose cancellation of the quadratic (AQ ) anomaly since (unlike AC and AG ) it cannot\nbe affected by a SU3 \u2297 SU2 \u2297 U1 singlet sector. Obviously for AQ = 0 we require either\n\u2206 = 0 or 8h2 + 6tc1 \u2212 224\n+ 14\n\u2206 = 0. We start with the \u2206 = 0 case, postponing discussion\n3\n9\n\nof the second possibility until later. On the one hand this means that a Higgs \u03bc-term is\nallowed, and so we have no solution to the \u03bc-problem; on the other hand from Eq. (2)\nwe see that the same \u03b8-field will in fact serve for both down and charged lepton matrices.\nMoreover we do not need to forbid terms of the kind, for example, H2 Qi tcj ( M\u03b8bU )aij , since\nno such (gauge invariant) term can be constructed.\nWe turn now to the issue of neutrino masses. If we wish to generate them via the\nseesaw mechanism then this suggests that we introduce three right-handed neutrinos with\n6\n\n\fzero U1\u2032 charges; however to obtain Dirac mass terms of the form H2 L\u03bd c we then require\na \u03b8-field capable of being matched to Li + h2 = 3tc1 + 4h2 \u2212 24. But if we examine\n\npotential dimension 4 R-parity violating operators, we find that the possible superpotential\n\noperators tc2 bc2 bc3 , tc1 bc1 bc3 , Qi Lj bc3 and Li Lj \u03c43c have the same charge as Li h2 , with disastrous\nconsequences for proton decay, if we allow them to be generated at the same level as\nthe H2 L\u03bd c terms. We could choose to impose R-parity conservation, but an attractive\nc\nalternative is to introduce only two right-handed neutrinos, with charges \u03bd1,2\n= \u00b1q\u03bd and\n\nintroduce \u03b8\u03bd with charge q\u03b8\u03bd such that\n\nLi + h2 + q\u03bd + nq\u03b8\u03bd = 0,\n\nand\n\nLi + h2 \u2212 q\u03bd + mq\u03b8\u03bd = 0\n\n(17)\n\nfor integer m, n. It is easy to show that if we choose, for example, n = 2 and m = 1\nand q\u03b8\u03bd = \u22129, then none of the R-parity violating Yukawas mentioned above (nor any R-\n\nviolating Yukawa) can be generated using the available \u03b8-charges. Consequently unrealistic\nproton decay is prevented. We obtain a \u03bd c matrix of the form (for consideration of various\n\nforms for the \u03bd c matrix see for example [41])\nM\u03bd c =\n\n\u0012\n\n0\nM1\u03bd\n\nM1\u03bd\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n(18)\n\nwhich has non-zero determinant and therefore will serve for the seesaw.\n\n3\n\nMoreover the\n\nDirac matrix from H2 L\u03bd c takes the form\na\u03bd \u03bbn\nmD = \uf8ed b\u03bd \u03bbn\nc\u03bd \u03bbn\n\uf8eb\n\n(where hH2 i =\n\n\u0012\n\n\uf8f6\nd\u03bd \u03bbm\ne\u03bd \u03bbm \uf8f8 v2 ,\nf\u03bd \u03bbm\n\n(19)\n\n\u0013\n0\n) and the eigenvalues of the resulting LH neutrino mass matrix\nv2\nT\nm\u03bd = mD M\u03bd\u22121\nc (mD )\n\n(20)\n\nare given by\nm\u03bd1..3 = 0, (M1\u03bd )\u22121 \u03bbm+n (n1 \u2213\n3\n\n\u221a\n\nn2 )\n\n(21)\n\nWith the choice of n, m, q\u03b8\u03bd above, there would be the possibility of a O(\u03bbM ) entry in place of\n\nthe zero for (M\u03bd c )22 ; this does not change any of our conclusions in an essential way (in particular\nthe matrix m\u03bd below retains a zero eigenvalue).\n\n7\n\n\fwhere\nn1 = a\u03bd d\u03bd + b\u03bd e\u03bd + c\u03bd f\u03bd ,\nn2 = d2\u03bd a2\u03bd + e2\u03bd b2\u03bd + f\u03bd2 c2\u03bd + e2\u03bd c2\u03bd + b2\u03bd f\u03bd2 + d2\u03bd b2\u03bd + a2\u03bd e2\u03bd + d2\u03bd c2\u03bd + a2\u03bd f\u03bd2 .\n\n(22)\n\nIt is clear that |m\u03bd3 | > |m\u03bd2 | and although both are the same order in \u03bb the relation\n\n|m\u03bd3 | = 10|m\u03bd2 | holds for \"reasonable values\" of a\u03bd * * * f\u03bd . Such a hierarchy accommodates\n\nsolar and atmospheric neutrino data-see for example Ref. [41]. With masses4\nm\u03bd1 = 0,\n\nm\u03bd2 = 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV,\n\nm\u03bd3 = 5 \u00d7 10\u22122 eV\n\n(23)\n\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\nwe would also expect large mixing angles \u03b812\n, \u03b823\nand a small mixing angle \u03b813\nin the\n\nrotation to the neutrino mass eigenstate basis from the charged lepton mass eigenstate\nbasis. It is easy to construct examples (without fine-tuning) that give rise to precisely this\nstructure within our scenario. In order to generate a neutrino spectrum in the region of\nEq. (23), we would require (assuming a\u03bd * * * f\u03bd are O(1))\nM1\u03bd \u223c \u03bb(m+n) 1016 GeV,\n\n(24)\n\nor M1\u03bd \u223c 1014 GeV in the case m + n = 3. An example consistent with our requirements is\ngiven by:\n\n\u22120.56\u03bb4\nmL = \uf8ed \u22120.36\u03bb4\n\u22120.49\u03bb4\n\uf8eb\n\n0.56\u03bb2\n\u22122.11\u03bb2\n\u22120.14\u03bb2\n\n\uf8f6\n\u22121.07\n\u22120.22 \uf8f8 ,\n\u22121.43\n\n\u03bb2\nmD = \uf8ed 2\u03bb2\n3\u03bb2\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\u03bb\n5\u03bb \uf8f8 v2 ,\n1.9\u03bb\n\n(25)\n\n(where mL is the charged lepton mass matrix) when we obtain the neutrino spectrum of\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\nEq.

Of course the\n\nresult for M1\u03bd is sensitive to the overall scale of mD .\n\nWe have therefore achieved our goal of incorporating neutrino masses into the AMSB\nparadigm; with the added bonus that no additional symmetries (beyond U1\u2032 ) are required to\nadequately suppress proton decay. The chief feature distinguishing the sparticle spectrum\nfrom the massless neutrino case considered in Ref. [13] is the splitting between the first\nand second generation right-handed squarks and sleptons (the degeneracy persists in the\nLH case because of the generation independent doublet U1\u2032 charges).\n4\n\nThe recently reported measurement [42] in neutrinoless double beta decay of a Majorana\n\nneutrino mass in the region 0.11 \u2212 0.56eV is not readily accommodated within our scenario; we\nnote, however, some controversy[43] regarding this result.\n\n8\n\n\fFor example, with tan \u03b2 = 5, gravitino mass m0 = 40TeV, \u03b61 = \u22120.02TeV2 and\n\n\u03b62 = 0.0227TeV2 , h2 = 12, tc1 = \u22127/2, we find |\u03bc| = 571GeV, and choosing sign \u03bc = \u22121\n\nwe obtain the following spectrum:\nmt\u03031 = 869,\n\nmt\u03032 = 484,\n\nm\u03c4\u03032 = 442,\n\nm\u0169L ,c\u0303L = 931,\n\nmd \u0303R = 998,\n\nms\u0303R = 1042,\n\nmb\u03031 = 825,\n\nm\u0169R = 908,\n\nm\u03c4\u03031 = 148,\n\nmc\u0303R = 856 md \u0303L ,s\u0303L = 934,\n\nm\u1ebdL ,\u03bc\u0303L = 149,\n\nm\u03bc\u0303R = 323 m\u03bd\u0303e ,\u03bd\u0303\u03bc = 126,\nmA = 161,\n\nmb\u03032 = 1082,\n\nm\u1ebdR = 117,\n\n(26)\n\nm\u03bd\u0303\u03c4 = 125 mh,H = 122, 166,\n\nmH \u00b1 = 181,\n\nm\u03c7\u0303\u00b1 = 112, 575,\n1,2\n\nm\u03c7\u03031***4 = 111, 369, 579, 579 mg\u0303 = 1007,\nwhere all masses are given in GeV. The squarks t\u03031 , b\u03031 and \u03c4\u03031 couple more strongly to tL , bL\nand \u03c4L respectively, though (for our chosen tan \u03b2) the t\u03031,2 mixing is of course substantial.\nFor a given m0 , an acceptable vacuum is obtainable for only a very restricted range of the\nparameters tan \u03b2, \u03b61 , \u03b62 . The main constraints on the boundary of the allowed region come\nfrom the slepton and Higgs masses. The triangular region in the \u03b61,2 plane which meets\nthese constraints is shown in Fig. 1 (for m0 = 40TeV, and tan \u03b2 = 5). The LSP can be the\nneutral wino (as in Eq. (26) above), or the \u03bd\u0303\u03c4 ; note, however, that there is a small region\nin which the \u1ebdR is the LSP, which we would exclude on cosmological grounds. The point\ncorresponding to our example of Eq. (26) is indicated by an asterisk in the diagram.\nAllowed region of \u03b6 , \u03b6 space showing LSP\n1\n\n2\n\n0.024\n\nNeutralino LSP\n\n0.023\n\n*\n\n0.022\n\nALLOWED REGION\n\nRH Selectron\nLSP\n\n\u03b62 in TeV\n\n2\n\nSneutrino\n0.021\nLSP\n\n0.02\n\n0.019\nFORBIDDEN REGION\n0.018\n\n0.017\n\u22120.03\n\n\u22120.025\n\n\u22120.02\n\n\u22120.015\n\n\u22120.01\n\n\u22120.005\n\n0\n\n0.005\n\n2\n\n\u03b6 in TeV\n1\n\nFig.1: Allowed values of \u03b61,2 for tan \u03b2 = 5, m0 = 40TeV and sign \u03bc = \u22121.\n9\n\n\fFor discussion of sneutrino cold dark matter, see Refs. [44]. For m0 \u223c 40 \u2192 50TeV\n\nwe find a maximum possible value of tan \u03b2 \u223c 15. With, for example, m0 = 50TeV and\n\ntan \u03b2 = 10 we find for \u03b61 = \u22120.03, \u03b62 = 0.032 a spectrum similar to the above with generally\nincreased masses. The spectrum always features the near-degenerate wino triplet that is\n\ncharacteristic of the AMSB scenario. However when the LSP is the \u03bd\u0303\u03c4 , the dominant decay\nmodes of the charged and neutral winos will be to \u03bd\u0303\u03c4 accompanied in the first case by a\ncharged lepton and in the second by a neutrino. There is substantial t\u0303L,R mixing and\nconsequently radiative corrections raise mh above the current bound mh > 114GeV[45]\n(we have included explicit radiative corrections other than leading logarithm effects in the\ncalculation of mh only). Notice that \u1ebdL , \u03bc\u0303L are quite light; in the so-called mAMSB model\n(where the slepton mass problem is resolved by adding a common (mass)2 to the scalars)\nthis would be disfavoured due to the existence of charge-breaking extrema of the scalar\npotential[29]. We will investigate this possibility in our context elsewhere.\nWe must consider the issue of scalar-mediated FCNCs, which at first sight would\nappear to pose a real problem, because of our generation-dependent U1\u2032 charges. The\nAMSB contributions to the scalar masses are diagonalised to a good approximation when\nwe transform to the fermion mass-diagonal basis; as in fact are the FI contributions to\nthe LH squarks and sleptons, because of the universal doublet U1\u2032 charges. Thus the main\nsource of supersymmetric FCNC effects is potentially from the RH squarks and sleptons.\nIn the case of the squarks, these effects can be reduced by increasing the gravitino mass\nm0 , which determines the scale of the AMSB contributions. However in the case of the\nsleptons, because of the crucial role of the FI terms, it is generally the case that some of\nthe sleptons are comparatively light. In the sample spectrum (Eq. (26)) note in particular\nthat m\u1ebdR = 117GeV. As we indicated above, what in fact saves us from trouble is the fact\nthat our choice of texture matrices means that the charged lepton masses are diagonalised\nby transforming (to a good approximation) the LH fields only.\nConsider, for example, the contribution to \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 from the neutralino/RH charged\n\nslepton loop. Because this contribution to the branching ratio is suppressed compared to\nthe chargino/LH sneutrino loop we are able to tolerate a larger amount of flavour mixing\nthan when this mixing occurs in the LH sector. We find, in fact, that we typically obtain\nRR\n\u03b4e\u03bc\n\nm2\u1ebdR \u03bc\u0303R\n=\n\u223c 10\u22122\n2\nm\u1ebdR\n\n(27)\n\nand that this leads to sufficient suppression of the branching ratio for \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 for the kind\n\nof spectrum shown in Eq. (26).\n\n10\n\n\fThe correlation between the supersymmetric contributions to (g \u2212 2)\u03bc and \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3\n\nthat has been discussed by a number of authors[40][46] is weakened here because the former\nis dominated by the chargino/LH sneutrino loop. For choices of \u03b61 , \u03b62 such that \u03bc\u0303L , \u1ebdL are\nlight compared to \u03bc\u0303R , \u1ebdR it is possible to obtain within our framework a supersymmetric\ncontribution to (g \u2212 2)\u03bc sufficient to explain the (now reduced [47]) discrepancy between\n\nthe Standard Model and experiment[48] while being consistent with the limit on \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3.\n\nWe now turn to the \u2206 6= 0 case. The Higgs \u03bc term is then forbidden by the U1\u2032\n\nsymmetry, but if |\u2206| is sufficiently large, then we can imagine generating the \u03bc-term\n\n\u03b8H nH\n)\nwhere\nvia the FN-mechanism[49], i.e. via an interaction of the form MU H1 H2 ( M\nU\n\nnH \u2248 16. The resulting sparticle spectrum is broadly similar to that considered above in\n\nthe \u2206 = 0 case, and neutrino masses can be introduced in a similar way. Depending on the\n\n\u03b8-charge assignments, it may be that whereas proton decay is adequately suppressed, lepton\nnumber-violating R-parity-violating operators are generated by the texture mechanism\ncausing decay of the LSP.\nTo summarise: with a generation-dependent U1\u2032 charge assignment we are able to\nextend our previous FI-based solution to the AMSB tachyonic slepton problem to accommodate neutrino masses. We achieve natural suppression of leptonic FCNCs via a\ncombination of universal doublet U1\u2032 charges and textures which are diagonalised primarily\nby LH transformations. We will consider in more detail elsewhere the constraints placed\non our general framework by experimental limits on sparticle masses, and other issues such\nas vacuum stability and CP-violation.\nAcknowledgements\nDRTJ and RW were supported by a PPARC Senior Fellowship and a PPARC Graduate\nStudentship respectively.
