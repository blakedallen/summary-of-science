The signature of these oscillations has been observed in Knight shift experiments on the high-temperature superconductor\nYBa2 Cu3 O6.5 and on the spin-chain compound Sr2 CuO3 . Here we analytically calculate NMR\nspectra, compare with the available experimental data for Sr2 CuO3 , and show that the interchain coupling is responsible for the complicated and so far unexplained lineshape.

NMR experiments\nhave been instrumental in investigating spin fluctuations\nand impurity effects in high-temperature superconductors\n[1], as well as in confirming the triplet nature of superconductivity in Sr2 RuO4 [2]. Quite recently, NMR was also\nused to study the CuO chains in YBa2 Cu3 O6.5 (YBCO)\n[3]. The NMR study showed that the chain ends induce\nFriedel-like oscillations which manifest themselves also in\nthe CuO2 planes. Similar oscillations have also been observed earlier in the prototypical quasi one-dimensional\nS = 1/2 spin chain compound Sr2 CuO3 (SCO) [4, 5].\nTheoretically, a large alternating component of the local susceptibility near the end of a semi-infinite Heisenberg chain has been predicted [6]. Other studies (for a\nrecent review see ref. [7]) have addressed local spin correlations near a chain end by numerical means in a variety of\none-dimensional models ranging from the frustrated and\ndimerized spin-1/2 chain to spin ladders and the spin-1\nHeisenberg chain [8].\n\ntransport perhaps related to the integrability of the model\nby Bethe ansatz. NMR and muon spin relaxation experiments on SCO [15, 16], on the other hand, have found\ndiffusive behavior. In order to analyze these experiments\non a quantitative level in the future, it is first of all important to know in how far a spin-only model for SCO is\nvalid. In particular, it has been claimed in ref. [5] that\nalready the NMR spectra - where only static correlations\nare tested - can only be understood if a coupling to the\nlattice is taken into account.\n\nIn the first part of this letter we will calculate NMR\nspectra for a Heisenberg chain with a Poisson distribution of non-magnetic impurities.This is known to be the\nrelevant model for SCO, with chain breaks caused by the\npresence of excess oxygen [17, 18]. We will start with the\nideal chain but will then show that the interchain couplings are essential to fully explain the experimental data\nfor SCO [4,5]. Our main findings are that the theoretically\ncalculated spectra for a spin-only model of weakly coupled Heisenberg chains are in perfect agreement with experiment whereas the phenomenological model proposed\nAn interesting open question concerning the physics of in [5], involving some coupling to lattice degrees of freethe spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain is whether its transport dom, cannot - if taken seriously - explain the data. The\nproperties are ballistic or diffusive. The theoretical re- calculated NMR spectra are based on a parameter-free forsults are contradictory [9\u201314] but seem to point to ballistic mula for the local susceptibility of finite S = 1/2 XXZ\np-1\n\n\fJ.

However,\nat temperatures T . 30 K additional structures are visible\nin the experimental spectra. The peak develops shoulders\nwhose separation is denoted by Dh in fig. 2(b) following\nthe notation introduced in [4]. Furthermore, a splitting of\nthe peak, \u03b4h, very different from the weight transfer with\ntemperature shown in fig. 1, is observed. In ref. [5] it has\nbeen tried to explain these features by a phenomenological\nmodel of mobile bond defects. In particular, the feature\n\u03b4h was ascribed to a periodic arrangement of bond defects\nleading to chain segments of odd length N only. However,\nanalytically we find that the splitting of the central peak\nwould then grow like \u223c h0res J ln1/4 (N )/(T N 1/2 ). Due to\nthe prefactor \u223c J this predicts a very rapid increase of\nthe splitting not observed in experiment showing that this\nmodel is incorrect. Instead, as we will show below, the additional features Dh and \u03b4h are a consequence of the interchain coupling. The interchain coupling along one of the\ncrystal axes perpendicular to the chains is of order J\u22a5 \u223c 5\nK while it is three orders of magnitude smaller along the\nother direction [17,21]. At T \u223c 30 K we might therefore already expect significant effects of the interchain couplings\nwhich, however, can be included perturbatively. Doing so\nwe find that the susceptibility oscillations near an impurity residing in one chain (zeroth order) lead to substantial\nreflections in the neighboring chain (first order) for parameters appropriate for SCO as shown in fig. 2(c). The\nratio of the maximum in chain I to the maximum in chain\nII is \u223c \u2206h/(Dh), i.e., the shoulders of the peak, Dh, are\ncaused by the maxima of the reflected oscillations. We find\n\n\u221a\nDh \u223c h0res J\u22a5 vT \u22123/2 but logarithmic corrections can disguise this scaling as will become clear later on. The splitting of the central peak \u03b4h, see fig. 2(b), has a more complicated origin. First, there are also a reflections in nextnearest neighboring chains (second order).\nThe maxima\n2\u221a\nwould then yield a splitting \u03b4h \u223c h0res J\u22a5\nvT \u22125/2 (again\nignoring logarithmic corrections). However, for impurity\nconcentrations p \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 relevant for the experiments\nthere is another effect which actually dominates: Including the first and second order reflections from neighboring chains, the chain of average length N\u0304 \u2248 1/p will not\nhave any sites left which show bulk behavior. This means\nthat at temperatures T . 30 K the probability for having Knight shifts corresponding to values close to the bulk\nsusceptibility starts to decrease dramatically thus leading\nto a drop in intensity in P (K). Therefore \u03b4h denotes not\na splitting of the central peak but rather a dip of intensity\nat the bulk susceptibility value. The oscillations, which\nnow basically spread over the entire crystal, might get further stabilized by anisotropic exchange terms. This might\nalso explain the small differences in the lineshape near the\npeak for h k a and h k c [4,5]. A detailed analysis of these\nanisotropy effects is beyond the scope of this letter.\nWe also want to stress that having additional structures\nin the spectra due to interchain couplings is very different from a scenario where instead such structures occur\ndue to a direct hyperfine interaction or a dipolar coupling of the nuclear spins with electron spins in adjacent\nchains. The latter case would lead to Dh/\u2206h = const.\n(\u03b4h/\u2206h = const.) as a function of temperature if the\nshoulders (splitting) are caused by this mechanism, respectively. Only three (two) different temperatures are\npresented in [5] where the shoulders (splitting) are visible,\nrespectively, making a detailed analysis impossible. However, we find that the data are consistent with Dh/\u2206h \u223c\n1/T as expected if interchain coupling dominates but certainly not consistent with either Dh/\u2206h = const. or\n\u03b4h/\u2206h = const..\nTo calculate the NMR lineshapes for SCO at low temperatures, we have to deal with a two-dimensional array\nof weakly coupled chains. In general, this is a very complicated task requiring a two-dimensional impurity averaging. However, for small impurity concentrations significant simplifications are possible. At a given temperature,\nthe oscillations extend over a characteristic length \u03be. If\nN\u0304 = 1/p \u226b \u03be then the probability of having two impurities in neighboring chains so close to each other that the\nzeroth order oscillations in the chain and the reflections\nfrom neighboring chains overlap is small. We therefore assume that reflections in a chain of length N only occur in\nregions where the chain shows bulk behavior. In a chain\nof length N , 2pN reflections from the nearest neighbor\nchains and 2pN reflections from nearest-neighbor chains\nwill occur on average. If a chain segment is long enough,\nwe consider the zeroth, first, and second order oscillations\nas independent entities. If the segment is too short, we\nreduce the extend of the first and second order oscilla-\n\np-3\n\n\fJ. Sirker N.Laflorencie\ntions mimicking the overlap. For the chain segments we\nthen do the full impurity averaging (3). The theoretically\ncalculated lineshapes we obtain this way are in excellent\nagreement with experiment as shown in fig. 2. For both\ntemperatures we use the peak to adjust the intensity. For\nT = 60 K we also used p and h0res as parameters and find\np = 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 and h0res = 7.5955 T. In fig. 2 (b) we use the\nsame values. An even better agreement would be obtained\nhere if we choose h0res = 7.598 T which is equivalent to a\ndeviation of 0.03% from our prediction for the evolution\nof the bulk susceptibility value. Furthermore, the intensity of the edges \u2206h is overestimated. This is most likely a\nconsequence of our assumption that the zeroth order oscillations do not overlap with the reflections. Configurations\nwhere such an overlap occur would wash out the maxima\nof the zeroth order oscillations. In addition, this might\nalso point to some deviations from a Poisson distribution\nwith short chains occurring less frequently than expected.\n\nN=100\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n\u03c7j\n\n0.6\n\nN=99\n\n0.4\n\nT/J=0.02\nBosonization\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n\u03c7j\n\nQMC\n0\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n0\n\n20\n\nj\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n-0.2\n100\n\nj\n\nFig. 3: (Color online) \u03c7j for \u2206 = 0.3 and T /J = 0.02.

Our result for the staggered\npart of the local susceptibility is therefore parameter free.\nThis means that we can directly compare our analytical\nresult for \u03c7j with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) data.

Umklapp scattering is\nthen marginally irrelevant and the scaling dimensions of\ncorrelation functions have to be replaced by renormalization group improved versions. For \u03c7j the calculations are\nrather similar to those in ref. [25] for the longitudinal spinspin correlation function. We find that we have to replace\n1/KL \u2192 1\u2212g in (9) whereas KL \u2261 1 in the oscillator part,\neq. (8). The renormalization of KL for this part is incorporated into an effective amplitude c \u2192 (2\u03c0 3 g)\u22121/4 . The\nrunning coupling constant g depends, in general, on the\nthree length scales x, L, and v/T . At low enough energies\nthe smallest scale will always dominate and g is given by\nthe solution of 1/g + ln(g)/2 = ln {C0 min[x, L \u2212 x, v/T ]}\nwhere C0 is a constant. In fig. 4 a comparison between this\nanalytic result and QMC data is shown with C0 = 6. We\nnote that fitting the constant C0 improves the results near\nthe boundaries. For low temperatures and x, L \u2212 x \u226b 1,\nhowever, the value of C0 becomes irrelevant and our result for \u03c7j therefore again parameter-free. The agreement\nwith QMC is not as good as for the anisotropic case. This\nis a consequence of the fact that g has been derived in the\nlimit x, L, v/T \u226b 1. However, the deviations are only of\nthe order of a few percent and have very little effect on\nthe NMR spectra presented in the first part of this letter.\nst(1)\nof susceptibility\nFinally, the first order reflection \u03c7j\noscillations in a neighboring chain, shown in fig. 2(c), is\ngiven in first order perturbation theory in J\u22a5 by\n\nFig. 5: (Color online) \u03c7st\nj for \u2206 = 1, J\u22a5 = 0.03J, and T = 0.1J.\nComparison between DMRG data (closed symbols) and field\ntheory (open symbols) for an infinite chain with a non-magnetic\nimpurity at j = 0 (squares) and an infinite neighboring chain\nwithout impurities (circles).\n\nParticularly suited to study the case of an infinite chain\nwith a single non-magnetic impurity at the origin which\nis weakly coupled to an infinite chain without impurities\nis the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) applied to transfer matrices.

This might make it hard to detect this power law in experiment. The second order reflections can be calculated\nanalogously.\n\nConclusions. \u2013 To conclude, we have derived an analytic formula for the local susceptibility of a finite Heisenberg chain. This allows us to calculate NMR spectra for\nspin chains with arbitrary impurity concentrations and\ndistributions which would be impossible by numerical calculations at temperatures T /J \u226a 1. We also showed how\nto calculate NMR spectra for weakly coupled spin chains if\nthe impurities are dilute. For SCO we have demonstrated\nexcellent agreement between our theory and experiment\nshowing that SCO is indeed a prototypical quasi onedimensional spin chain compound. More generally speaking, we have shown that NMR spectra are extremely useful\nto extract information about the impurity concentration\nas well as about the magnetic couplings.
