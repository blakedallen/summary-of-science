Introduction\nThe determination of cosmological parameters has always been\na central question in cosmology. In this respect the measurements of the Cosmological Microwave Background (CMB)\nanisotropies on degree angular scales has brought one of the\nmost spectacular results in the field: the flatness of the spatial geometry of the universe, implying that its density is close\nto the critical density. Although, during the last twenty years\nthe evidence for the existence of non-baryonic dark matter has\nstrongly gained in robustness, observations clearly favor a relatively low matter content somewhere between 20 and 50% of\nthe critical density, indicating that the dominant form of the\ndensity of the universe is an unclustered form. Furthermore, the\nobservations of distant supernovae, at cosmological distance,\nSend offprint requests to: douspis@astro.ox.ac.uk\n\u22c6\ne-mail: douspis@astro.ox.ac.uk\n\u22c6\u22c6\ne-mail: riazuelo@spht.saclay.cea.fr\n\u22c6\u22c6\u22c6\ne-mail: zolniero@ast.obs-mip.fr\n\u2020\ne-mail: alain.blanchard@ast.obs-mip.fr\n\nprovide a direct evidence for an accelerating universe, which is\nnaturally explained by the gravitational domination of a component with a relatively large negative pressure, PQ = wQ \u03c1Q\nwith wQ < \u22121/3. The cosmological constant \u039b (for which\nw\u039b = \u22121) is historically the first possibility which has been\nintroduced and which satisfies this requirement. However, the\npresence of a non-zero cosmological constant is a huge problem in physics: (i) quantum field theory predicts that \u039b should\nbe the sum of a number of enormous contributions, so in order\nto avoid a cosmological catastrophe, it is usually assumed that\na yet unknown mechanism produces a cancelation between all\nthese contributions; (ii) it is difficult to think of a mechanism\nwhich puts \u039b to 0 exactly, but it is even more difficult to find\na mechanism which gives \u03c1\u039b \u223c \u03c1c \u223c 10\u2212122 \u03c1Pl , as the supernovae observations suggest, where \u03c1Pl and \u03c1c are the Planck energy density and the critical density today, respectively. For this\nreason the concept of quintessence, a scalar field with negative\npressure, has recently been proposed as a possible alternative\nto a cosmological constant.\n\n\f2\n\nM. Douspis et al.: Cosmological parameters estimation in the Quintessence Paradigm\n\nIn this paper we shortly describe the quintessence paradigm\nand its effect on some observable quantities. We then summarise the different sets of data and methods used to constrain\ncosmological parameters. We then conclude by showing the results on quintessence and cosmological parameters.\n\n2. Quintessence\nThe idea of quintessence was proposed in order to allow the\npresence of an non zero dark energy, as suggested by observations, without being confronted to the dramatic fine-tuning\nproblem of the cosmological constant. Indeed, one still assumes that an unknown mechanism puts the bare cosmological\nconstant is zero, and the smallness of the dark energy has a dynamical origin, coming from a scalar field \u03c6 which has not yet\nreached the minimum of its potential V(\u03c6).\nA large number of quintessence models were already\nconsidered in the literature. Historically, the first proposed\nquintessence model had an inverse power law potential, V(\u03c6) =\nM 4+\u03b1 /\u03c6\u03b1 (Ratra & Peebles 1988; Wetterich 1988; Caldwell et\nal. 1998), where the exponent \u03b1 is positive and M is an energy scale fixed so that the scalar field has the correct energy\ndensity today. This unusual shape, which can have some motivations from particle physics (Bin\u00e9truy 1999, 2000), insures\nthat regardless of the initial conditions, the field will reach\na so-called \"tracking regime\" (Steinhardt et al. 1999), where\nits pressure and energy density tend to a constant ratio given\nby PQ /\u03c1Q \u2261 wQ = (\u03b1wB \u2212 2)/(\u03b1 + 2), where wB represent\nthe pressure to energy density ratio of the other background\nmatter fluids (photons, neutrinos, baryons, and cold dark matter). Moreover, since we have in this regime wQ < wB , this\nensures that the quintessence energy density decreases more\nslowly than that of the background fluids and that ultimately,\nthe quintessence field will become dominant. When this oc> 0.5, the\ncurs, i.e., when its density parameter reaches \u03a9Q \u223c\nfield slows down in its potential, and reaches asymptotically\nwQ = \u22121 (Steinhardt et al. 1999). The rate at which one goes\nfrom the tracking regime to the cosmological regime is usually\nquite slow, so that unless wQ is already close to \u22121 in the tracking regime, it will still be significantly different from \u22121 when\n\u03a9Q \u223c 0.7. For example, if \u03b1 = 6, in which case wQ = \u22120.25 in\nthe tracking regime during the matter-dominated era, one has\nwQ = \u22120.4 today if \u03a9Q = 0.7. This feature leaves the hope of\ndistinguishing a quintessence field from a cosmological constant.\nThe effect of a quintessence field on CMB anisotropies is\ntwofold (Brax et al. 2000). First, when the quintessence field\nbecomes dominant it modifies the expansion rate of the universe. This translates into a modification of the angular distance\nvs. redshift relation, and hence a shift in the peak structure of\n> 100.\nthe CMB anisotropies power spectrum, the Cl 's, for l \u223c\nSecond, the gravitational potentials decay at late time as the\nuniverse is no longer matter-dominated. This produces a socalled integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and modifies the Cl spectrum at low multipoles (l \u223c< 20) as a consequence of the fact that\nphotons exchange energy with time-varying gravitational potentials. Both of these effects are also present with a cosmological constant, but they differ quantitatively with a quintessence\n\nfield: the shift in the peak position is smaller, whereas the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect can be very different (Caldwell et al.\n1998).\nMost of the CMB experiments do not cover a large fraction\nof the sky. On the contrary, the new Archeops data (Beno\u0131\u0302t et al.\n2002a; Beno\u0131\u0302t et al. 2002b) are extremely precise around l \u223c\n200 improving by a factor of two the precision measurements\non the location of the first Doppler peak (Beno\u0131\u0302t et al. 2002c),\nwhereas at larger angular scales (low l) the COBE data are\nlimited by a large cosmic variance (Tegmark 1996). Therefore\nwe can hope being able to contrain the quintessence parameters\nby through their influence on the position of the first Doppler\npeak rather than through the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. It\nis well-known that the position of the first peak is primarily\nsensitive to the curvature but also to several other cosmological\nparameters. It is therefore important to investigate a wide space\nof parameters in order to constraint the possible existence of\nquintessence in a robust way.\nFinally, let us add that quintessence also modifies significantly the matter power spectrum: as for the cosmological constant, matter fluctuations stop growing at the onset of\nquintessence domination. This has an influence on the normalization of the matter power spectrum on small scales, \u03c38 . This\neffect of wQ can be understood as follows: as long as wQ is not\ntoo close to 0, one can roughly consider that the universe has\nexperienced two distinct epochs since recombination: a first\n(usual) one where it was matter-dominated, and a second one\nwhere it is quintessence-dominated. The transition occurs when\n\u03a9mat = \u03a9Q = 0.5. If we suppose that \u03a9Q = 0.7 today, then the\ntransition epoch occured at a redshift of\nmat\n\nzQ\n\n\u03a9Q\n=\n\u03a9mat\n\n! 3w\u22121\n\nQ\n\n\u2212 1.\n\n(1)\n\nFor wQ = \u22121 (cosmological constant case), one has zmat\n\u039b = 0.33,\nwhereas for wQ = \u22120.2, this gives zmat\n=\n3.1.\nIf\nwe\nsuppose\nthat\nQ\nperturbations grow as the scale factor before the transition and\nstop growing immediately afterward, then, this corresponds to\na reduction of\n1 + zmat\n\u039b\nR=\n1 + zmat\nQ\n\n!2\n\n\u03a9Q\n=\n\u03a9mat\n\n! 23\n\n\u0012\n\n1+ w1\n\nQ\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nin the matter power spectrum as compared to the cosmological constant case. In practice, several factors modify this\namount, such as the fact the the matter perturbation still grow\n(although slowly) in the quintessence-dominated era, but this\nillustrate the dramatic change in the matter power spectrum\nthat quintessence can trigger [see also Benabed & Bernardeau\n(2001)]. When wQ = 0, the situation is even more dramatic as\nmatter never dominates. In order to understand the value of \u03c38 ,\none is has to compute the growth of dark matter perturbations\nwhen one has a mixture of matter and quintessence with identical equation of state. Neglecting the quintessence fluctuations\n(which are never subject to any instability), the Jeans equation\nis rewritten as\n3\n\u03b4\u0308 + H \u03b4\u0307 \u2212 H 2 \u03a9mat \u03b4 = 0,\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\fM. Douspis et al.: Cosmological parameters estimation in the Quintessence Paradigm\n\n3\n\nGaussian adiabatic fluctuations and a flat geometry of space.\nWe assume a vanishing amount of gravitational waves as such\na contribution has little impact on the position of the peak, but\nrather modifies the relative amplitude power between low and\nlarge l. Identically, a reionisation effect and a possible hot dark\nmatter component are neglected in the following. We make the\nassumption that wQ = Const throughout all the epochs of interest. This assumption is unjustified in realistic quintessence\nmodels as one expects wQ to have varied at the radiation to matter transition and to be decreasing today. However, if we want\nto study the influence of the quintessence field on the position\nof the Doppler peaks of the CMB anisotropies, then this is sufficent, and the constant wQ has to be seen as some \"average\" of\na dynamical wQ (z) arising in a quintessence scenario.\n\n3.1. Likelihood from CMB\nIn order to use CMB data, we first reconstruct the likelihood\nfunction of the various experiments.\n\nFig. 1. The amplitude of matter fluctuations \u03c38 as a function of a constant wQ in cosmological models with \u03a9Q = 0.7,\n\u03a9b h2 = 0.02, H0 = 66.5, n = 1, and \u03a9tot = 1, with amplitude\nnormalized to match the COBE data.\nWhen \u03b4 represents the matter perturbation density constrast,\nan overdot denotes a derivative with respect to conformal time\n(defined by a d\u03b7 = dt, where a is the scale factor and t is the\ncosmic time), and H \u2261 \u0227/a. The only difference with the usual\nmatter-dominated case is that we do not have \u03a9mat = 1 in the\nabove equation. In the matter-dominated era, a \u221d \u03b72 , so that\nH = 2/\u03b7, and one has\n6\n2\n\u03b4\u0308 + \u03b4\u0307 \u2212 2 \u03a9mat \u03b4 = 0.\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\n\n(4)\n\nWhen \u03a9mat = 1, one gets the usual result that the growing\nmode goes as \u03b4+ \u221d a. If we now suppose that \u03a9mat = 0.3,\nthen the growing mode goes as \u03b4+ \u221d a0.466 . If this regime lasts\nfor several orders of magnitude in redshift, then this represents\nan enormous reduction in the matter power spectrum, of around\n(1+\u2206z)1.07 , where \u2206z represent the duration of this regime. This\neffect will imply that \u03c38 is drastically reduced when one goes\nfrom wQ = \u22121 to wQ = 0. In order to illustrate this point we have\ncomputed the amplitude of matter fluctuations \u03c38 for a family\nof models which have the same same cosmological parameters\nbut the equation of state wQ (Fig. 1). As one can see \u03c38 varies\ndramatically with wQ and is therefore a very useful quantity to\ntake into account in order to constrain quintessence.\n\n3. Methods and Data\nIn the following, we make use of the most recent data available on the CMB as well as on other relevant cosmological\nquantities in order to examine constraints that can be set on\nthe amount of quintessence present in the universe. We assume\n\nWe follow the technique developped in Bartlett et al.\n(2000), and used in Douspis et al. (2001) and Beno\u0131\u0302t et al.\n(2002c), by constructing a large Cl power spectra database. We\ninvestigate six cosmological parameters assuming flat cosmology (\u03a9tot = 1). The density of the universe is parametrised\nby the baryon contribution, \u03a9b h2 , and the dark energy, \u03a9Q , for\nwhich we allow its pressure-energy density ratio, wQ to vary.\nThe Hubble parameter, H0 , the spectral index, n, and the\nnormalisation of the spectra, parametrized in this work by \u03c38\nare the remaining free parameters. Table 1 describes the corresponding gridding used for the database.\nWe proceed by estimating cosmological parameters from\nthe likelihood functions reconstructed as described in Beno\u0131\u0302t et\nal. (2002c). We compute the value of the likelihood considering\nthe actual band powers dataset of the COBE, BOOMERanG,\nDASI, MAXIMA, VSA, CBI, Archeops experiments (Tegmark\n1996; Netterfield et al. 2002; Halverson et al. 2002; Lee et\nal. 2001; Scott et al. 2002; Pearson et al.2002; Beno\u0131\u0302t et al.\n2002b) on each model of our grid. In our approach, the best\nmodel is estimated as being those for which the likelihood is\nmaximal Lmax , while the 68% (resp. 95%) 1-parameter interval\ncorresponds to \u22122 ln(L/Lmax ) \u2208 [0, 1] (resp. \u22122 ln(L/Lmax ) \u2208\n[0, 4]) and the 68% (resp. 95%) 2-parameters interval corresponds to \u22122 ln(L/Lmax ) \u2208 [0, 2.3] (resp. \u22122 ln(L/Lmax ) \u2208\n[0, 6.18]). The likelihood shown in the following are already\nmargilalized (by maximisation) over the calibration uncertainties and the amplitude. The results are presented as 2-D contour\nplots, showing in shades of blue the regions where the likelihood function for a combination of any two parameters drops\nto the levels corresponding to 68%, 95%, and 99% confidence\nregions. They would correspond to 1, 2, 3 \u03c3, respectively if the\nlikelihood function were Gaussian. Dashed red contours mark\nthe limits to be projected if confidence intervals are sought for\nany one of the parameters. To calculate either 1- or 2-D confidence intervals, the likelihood function is maximized over the\nremaining parameters.\n\n\f4\n\nM.

Other Data\nIn order to combine with other data of cosmological relevance,\nthe corresponding additional likelihood have to be evaluated.\nAn interesting useful additional constraint to add is those\nobtain on the amplitude of matter fluctuations on small scales:\npresent day clusters data allow to constrain \u03c3c , related to \u03c38\nwith a high accuracy, of the order of 5% (Blanchard et al.\n2000). Similar constraint can be obtained from weak lensing measurements (Bacon et al. 2000; van Waerbeke et al.\n2002). However, significant differences among similar analyses have appeared in recent works based on clusters as well\nas on weak lensing measurements (Jarvis et al. 2002; Brown\net al. 2002, Hamana et al. 2002). We have therefore chosen\nto use two recent constraints, the differences of which will\nallow us to investigate a realistic range of systematic uncertainties. We first consider a constraint leading to high values\nof \u03c38 (high \u03c38 hereafter), in agreement with Pierpaoli et al.\n(2001): \u03c38 \u03a90.6\nmat = 0.5 \u00b1 10% (68% C.L.). Then, new estimations from Seljak et al. (2001), Viana et al. (2002), Reiprich\net al. (2002), leading to lower values, are considered by taking\n\u03c38 \u03a90.38\nmat = 0.43 \u00b1 10% (68% C.L.), hereafter low \u03c38 . The latter\nerror bars estimates encompass the three above low normalization measurements of \u03c38 .\nWe also use the recent determination of the Hubble parameter from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Key Project\n(Freedman et al. 2001): H0 = 72 \u00b1 8 (68% C.L.), assuming\nGaussian uncertainty.\nFor the distant supernovae constraints we compute the likelihood as follows. The magnitude-redshift relation of the supernovae is given by the following relation\nM = M + 5 log10 DL (z, wQ , \u03a9Q ),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere M is the observed magnitude and DL and M are respectively the \"Hubble-parameter-free\" luminosity-distance and the\n\"Hubble-parameter-free\" absolute magnitude at the maximum\nof the supernova. DL is a function of redshift of the supernova,\nz, and of the cosmological parameters wQ and \u03a9Q . In the case\nof a flat universe with wQ as the pressure to energy density ratio\nof the quintessence field, the DL function is given by\nDL (z, wQ , \u03a9Q )\nZ z\n(1 + z)\n0\n\n=\ndu\np\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03a9Q )(1 + u)3 + \u03a9Q (1 + u)3(1+wQ )\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nWith the sample of supernovae from Perlmutter et al.

We take for measured magnitude M obs and uncertainty \u03c3 the B-band peak magnitude and\nthe total uncertainty of the supernovae from Perlmutter et al.\n(1999). At each point of the two parameters grid, wQ and \u03a9Q\nis associated a likelihood value obtained by maximising it over\nthe absolute magnitude M.\n\n4. Results\n\n4.1. CMB alone\nConstraints given by the CMB on some of our investigated\nparameters are shown in Fig. 2. Considering only CMB constraints leads to degeneracies between parameters. Fig. 2 shows\nthe case of two parameters, n and \u03a9b h2 , which are not affected by the assumed equation of state of the dark energy.\nTheir prefered values and error bars are n = 0.95 \u00b1 0.05 and\n\u03a9b h2 = 0.021 \u00b1 0.003 (68% C.L.). Using CMB alone leaves\nthe 2-parameters space (\u03a9Q , wQ ) almost unconstrained. Finally,\n2D diagrams \u03a9Q vs. H0 or wQ vs. H0 show significant level\nof correlation, but with degeneracies. This is illustrated by the\nplot \u03a9Q vs. H0 shown in Fig. 2. In our analysis, we found that\nwith the improvement of CMB data obtained by the addition\nof Archeops band powers reduces appreciably the contours of\nconstraints on the quintessence parameters as well as on cosmological parameters because of the position and the amplitude of the first acoustic peak are better determined, but still\ndoes not allow to break the degeneracies.\n\n\fM.

Adding Non CMB priors\nAs cluster abundance observations lead to a strong constraint\non the normalization of the matter power spectrum, and \u03c38 is\nrather sensitive to the changing the equation of state, it is natural to expect that this constraint in combination with constraints\nfrom Cl will lead to tight constraint on quintessence scenarios.\nFig. 3 (left panels) shows the combination of CMB data with\nthe two \u03c3c priors described previously. As one can see, constraints on the amplitude of matter fluctuations on small scales\nhas the potential to break the degeneracies between \u03a9Q and\nwQ . Only a band-shaped region of the plane is not excluded.\nFurthermore, combinations with different priors lead to different likelihood contours, due to the strong effect of the equation of state on \u03c38 emphasized in Section 2. More specifically,\nwe find that the CMB, combined with the high normalization\nleads to a prefered region which is marginally consistent with\nthe constraints given by high redshift supernovae (overplotted\nblack lines in Fig. 3). The \"concordance model\" (\u03a9Q = 0.7,\nwQ = \u22121) lies on the 99% C.L. contours, and defines the two\ndataset as inconsistent. The best model appears then to have\n\u03a9Q = 0.4, wQ = \u22120.5, which is itself outside the 99% confidence region of the supernovae constraints. The combination of\nCMB with low normalization leads on the other hand to likelihood contours in agreement with those of supernovae and HST\nkey project determination of H0 .\nDue to the form of the joint CMB + \u03c38 (high or low)\ncontours, a combination with the HST constraints is expected\nto give stronger constraints on both \u03a9Q and wQ . The corresponding likelihood contours of Fig. 3 (middle right panel)\nshow that quintessence is not prefered over classical cosmological constant even if the degeneracy is not totally broken:\n+0.4\n\u03a9Q = 0.70+0.16\n(95% C.L.).\n\u22120.12 , wQ = \u22121\nIn order to break the degeneracy, it is clearly necessary\nto consider the additional information on the angular distance\ncoming from distant supernovae. Considering a flat cosmology, the information on the luminosity of the supernovae can\nbe expressed in term of constraints on the dark energy density and equation of state. Prefered value are consistent with\n\na cosmological constant, and the likelihood contours are almost perpendicular to those of CMB, as shown in Fig. 3.\nCombining all the priors finally allows to put strong constraints\non both quintessence parameters (Fig. 3, rightmost panel):\n+0.25\n\u03a9Q = 0.70+0.10\n(95% C.L.) and finally breaks\n\u22120.17 , wQ = \u22121\nthe (H0 , \u03a9Q ) degeneracy, see Fig. 4.\nAs a main result, it appears that the classical \u039bCDM scenario is then conforted and given the priors we used there is no\nneed for quintessence to reproduce the present data, although\nquintessence models with low wQ are still viable, and that good\nfits to the data can also be found for models with wQ < \u22121\n(Melchiorri et al. 2002)1 . However, those correspond to rather\nunusual quintessence models.\nGoing back to typical quintessence models, finding only\nlow values of wQ raises some interesting points. If we consider\na pure inverse power law potential, having wQ < \u22120.6 when\n\u03a9Q = 0.7 implies a low value of the exponent \u03b1 (if the slope of\nthe potential is too steep, the field does not stop rapidly when\nit starts dominating, and wQ is too large). This translates into\nan annoyingly low value of the energy scale M arising in the\npotential, since one has M \u223c MPl (\u03c1c /MPl4 )1/(4+\u03b1) (Brax et al.\n2000). For example, in order to have M > 103 TeV, one needs\n\u03b1 \u2265 6, whereas data favor wQ < \u22120.6, which corresponds to\n\u03b1 \u223c< 3, or M \u223c< 20 GeV. There are of course several possibilities which allow to have a lower wQ in quintessence scenarios. An example to evade this problem is to use the SUGRA\npotential found by Brax & Martin (1999), which is given by\nV = M 4+\u03b1 /\u03c6\u03b1 \u00d7 exp( 21 \u03c62 /MPl2 ). The exponential correction\ncomes from supergravity considerations and insures that the\npotential has a local minimum which is almost reached by the\nfield today. For example, for \u03a9Q = 0.7, one has wQ = \u22120.8,\nalmost independently of \u03b1. This illustrates the fact that if it is\nstill difficult to distinguish some quintessence models from a\ncosmological constant with the present state of available data,\n1\nDuring the preparation of this work, another group submitted a related paper to the archive (Melchiorri et al. 2002). Although the analysis is not exactly the same, their conclusions are similar.\n\n\f6\n\nM.

Conclusion\nWe have studied the constraints that can be obtained on cosmological parameters within the quintessence paradigm by using\nvarious combinations of observational data set. For simplicity,\nonly models with constant wQ were examined as they are believed to be sufficient to existing data at their present accuracy\nlevel. For similar reasons, we neglected possible reionization or\nnon-zero gravitational wave contribution. Indeed, this approach\nhas the advantage to help to understand whether quintessence\nmodels should be favored or not over a classical cosmological\nconstant, while constraints on more specific scenarios have to\nbe investigated directly one by one (Douspis et al. 2002). Our\nanalysis method has been to investigate contours in 2-D parameters space. Such an approach allows to examine possible\ndegeneracies among parameters which are not easy to identify\nwhen constraints are formulated in term of a single parameter.\nFor instance, we found that CMB data alone, despite the high\nprecision data obtained by Archeops do not require the existence of a non-zero contribution of quintessence, because of\nthe degeneracy with the Hubble parameter: in practice CMB\ndata leave a large fraction of the (\u03a9Q , wQ ) plane unconstrained,\nwhile only a restricted region of the (\u03a9Q , H0 ) plane is allowed.\nOn the contrary, we found that almost no correlation exist with\nthe baryonic content \u03a9b nor the primordial index n. In order\nto restrict the parameter space of allowed models, we have applied several different constraints. Interestingly, we found that\nthe amplitude of the dark matter fluctuations, as measured by\nclusters abundance or large scale weak lensing data can potentially help to break existing degeneracies, although existing\nuncertainties, mainly systematics in nature, do not allow firm\nconclusion yet. Clearly this will be an important check of consistency in the future. We have then added constraints from supernovae data as well as HST estimation of the Hubble parameter in order to break existing degeneracies. This allows us to\ninfer very tight constraints on the possible range of equation of\nstate of the dark energy. Probably the most remarkable result is\nthat no preference for quintessence does emerge from existing\nCMB data although, accurate measurement of the amplitude\n\nBacon, D. J., Refregier, A.
