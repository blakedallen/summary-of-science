The entropy\nof a geometrical object seems to depend on the area of a boundary surface. In the case\nof a black hole, thermodynamic arguments suggest that its entropy is proportional to the\narea of its event horizon. This expectation has been confirmed on the microscopic side by\ncalculations for some special cases of black holes.\nThe separation of a system into two subsystems gives rise to the notion of the entanglement entropy which quantifies the quantum correlations between the two subsystems. One\ncan take the subsystems to be two regions of space separated by a boundary surface. Early\ncalculations in quantum field theories indicated that the entanglement entropy between the\ndegrees of freedom in two regions separated by a boundary surface is proportional to the\narea of the boundary surface [1, 2, 3, 4]. These developments have led to the intuition\nthat the entanglement entropy is dominated by degrees of freedom close to the boundary\nsurface, so it is natural to expect that the entanglement entropy is proportional to the area.\nThe connection between the entropy of a geometric system, on the one hand, and the entanglement entropy between the quantum field theory degrees of freedom between spatially\ndisconnected regions, on the other hand, is not clear. There have even been suggestions that\nthe black hole entropy is entirely entanglement entropy [5]. This suggests the possibility\nthat when the boundary surface is taken to be an event horizon, the two types of entropy\nare identical or at least related. Therefore it becomes important to examine the properties\nof entanglement entropy in more general cases and attempt to understand its properties\nwhen the entanglement involves regions separated by a horizon.\nThe entanglement entropy is ultraviolet divergent and must be regularized. Presumably\na more fundamental theory at the Planck scale will provide the mechanism that eliminates\nthe divergence. Since we are not yet aware of how the underlying theory regularizes the\ndivergence, we are forced to do so by hand in calculations. The regularization involves\nthe Planck scale and the expectation that entanglement entropy may be connected to the\ntheory of quantum gravity is suggested by simple dimensional analysis. If indeed the entanglement entropy is proportional to the area of the boundary surface in Planck units, then\nthe connection to a holographic principle similar to the one suggested by the AdS/CFT\n2\n\n\fcorrespondence [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], may apply to the entanglement entropy.\nAfter the initial studies of the entanglement entropy [1, 2, 3, 4], most research in the\nsubject has been devoted to CFTs. When a field theory is conformal, there are additional\ntools to compute the entanglement entropy, which, in fact, is proportional to the central\ncharge [11]. Even when the CFT is modified by adding mass deformations [11, 12, 13],\nthe same property holds. Also, recent calculations of entanglement entropy in this context\nsuggest a holographic interpretation [14, 15]. The connection between the entanglement\nentropy and holography has also been discussed in more general contexts [16, 17]. Scaling of\nthe entaglement entropy with the area of the boundary have also been verified by numerical\ncomputations [18, 19].\nIn this paper, we investigate the entanglement entropy of a quantum field theory in the\ncase of an arbitrary boundary surface embedded in a background with spatial curvature.\nOur results contain many previously derived results as special cases, but are more general\nbecause we consider arbitrary geometries. Ultimately one would want to consider the even\nmore general case involving spacetime curvature, so the comparison with other forms of\nentropy can be made explicit.\n\nII.\n\nENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY\n\nIn this section, we compute the entanglement entropy by using two main tools, the replica\nmethod and the heat kernel method.\nIn the replica method (see, for example, Ref. [3]), the entropy is expressed as the limit\nk \u2192 1 of an expression involving the kth power of the (reduced) density matrix. Expressing\nthe density matrix as a path integral, we are lead to consider the manifold which is the\nresult of gluing k copies of the original manifold. This gives an expression of the entropy\nin terms of the path integral over closed curves in the glued manifold, which is described in\nthe subsection II A.\nFor a free scalar field on an arbitrary base manifold, the resulting path integral is expressed\nin terms of the spectral quantities of a differential operator. It is convenient to study these\nquantities by the heat kernel method. We use it in the subsection II B to obtain an expression\nfor the entropy in which the dependence on the hypersurface is factored out.\nThis leads to several properties of the entropy which we derive in the subsection II C. In\n3\n\n\fparticular, we compute the entropy for a hypersurface which is a direct product of manifolds,\nprove the addititivity property of the entropy, and compute the leading terms of asymptotic\nexpansions of the entropy.\nIn the heat kernel method (see, for example, Refs. [20, 21]), the spectral information\nis obtained from an asymptotic expansion of the trace of the heat kernel of the operator.\nAll terms in the expansion are determined by the geometry of the underlying manifold.\nAlthough they can be computed in principle, the computations are quite complicated in\npractice. The parameters in the resulting asymptotic expansion are an ultraviolet cutoff\nscale and geometric scales associated with the manifold. In the subsection II D, this leads\nto an asymptotic expansion for the entropy, which involves geometric quantities associated\nwith the hypersurface. We show that the term proportional to the volume of the manifold\nis absent and the leading term is proportional to the volume of the hypersurface.\n\nA.\n\nReplica Method\n\nWe consider a field theory on a generally curved space which is divided by an arbitrary\nhypersurface into two parts. The quantum fields in the two parts are entangled, and our goal\nis the calculation of the entanglement entropy. Let M be an n \u2212 1 dimensional Riemannian\nmanifold without a boundary and let \u03a3 \u2282 M be a closed hypersurface (a submanifold of\ncodimension 1). \u03a3 divides M into two parts, the interior part M \u2032 and the exterior part\nM \u2032\u2032 . Let \u03c6 be a field on M, and (\u03c6\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032\u2032) its restrictions to (M \u2032 , M \u2032\u2032 ), and let \u03c8(\u03c6\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032\u2032 ) be a\nwave function corresponding to the field having the value (\u03c6\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032\u2032 ) on (M \u2032 , M \u2032\u2032 ). The density\nmatrix for (\u03c6\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032\u2032 ) is\n\u03c1(\u03c6\u20321 , \u03c6\u2032\u20321 , \u03c6\u20322 , \u03c6\u2032\u20322 ) = \u03c8(\u03c6\u20321 , \u03c6\u2032\u20321 )\u03c8(\u03c6\u20322 , \u03c6\u2032\u20322 ),\n\n(1)\n\nand the reduced density matrix for \u03c6\u2032 is obtained by tracing over the degrees of freedom of\nthe field on M \u2032\u2032 ,\n\u2032\n\n\u03c1\n\n(\u03c6\u20321 , \u03c6\u20322 )\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c6\u2032\u2032 \u03c1(\u03c6\u20321 , \u03c6\u2032\u2032 , \u03c6\u20322 , \u03c6\u2032\u2032).\n\nThe reduced density matrix \u03c1\u2032 represents the mixed state with the associated entropy\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u2032\n\u2202\n\u03c1\u2032\n\u03c1\n\u2032\nlog tr \u03c1\u2032k .\nlog\n= lim 1 \u2212\nS = \u2212 tr\nk\u21921\ntr \u03c1\u2032\ntr \u03c1\u2032\n\u2202k\n4\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n\fThe quantity tr \u03c1\u2032 =\n\nR\n\nd\u03c6\u2032 \u03c1\u2032 (\u03c6\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) in the denominator guarantees the correct normalization\n\nfor the density matrix. The second equality embodies the replica method (see, for example,\nRef. [3]).\nIn order to obtain the path integral representation for the kth power of the density\nmatrix we introduce an auxiliary field \u03c6(\u03c4, x) defined on N = R \u00d7 M and which satisfies the\nboundary condition \u03c6(0, x) = \u03c60 (x). The parameter \u03c4 represents Euclidean time. Let I(\u03c6)\nbe an action for the field \u03c6. The wave function is \u03c8(\u03c6) = Z(N, \u03c60, \u03c6), where\nZ\n\u0001\nZ(N, \u03c60, \u03c6) =\nd\u03c6 exp \u2212I(\u03c6)\n\n(4)\n\nC(N,\u03c60 ,\u03c6)\n\nis a path integral over the space C(N, \u03c60 , \u03c6) of curves defined on N and which satisfy\nboundary conditions \u03c6(0, x) = \u03c60 (x) and \u03c6(T, x) = \u03c6(x) for some T \u2208 R. Using T = \u2212\u221e\nfor \u03c8(\u03c6\u20321 , \u03c6\u2032\u2032 ) and T = \u221e for \u03c8(\u03c6\u20322 , \u03c6\u2032\u2032 ), we find\n\u03c1\u2032 (\u03c6\u20321 , \u03c6\u20322 ) = Z(N, \u03c6\u20321 , \u03c6\u20322 ).\n\n(5)\n\nThe function \u03c6(\u03c4, x) has a discontinuity at \u03c4 = 0 since \u03c6(0\u2212 , x) = \u03c6\u20321 (x) and \u03c6(0+ , x) =\n\u03c6\u20322 (x). However, \u03c6(\u03c4, x) is continuous on the manifold \u00d11 , which is defined as the manifold\nN with the cut along {\u03c4 = 0} \u00d7 M \u2032 .\nThe kth power of the density matrix is\nZ\n\u2032k\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c1 (\u03c61 , \u03c6k+1) = d\u03c6\u20322 d\u03c6\u20323 * * * d\u03c6\u2032k \u03c1\u2032 (\u03c6\u20321 , \u03c6\u20322 )\u03c1\u2032 (\u03c6\u20322 , \u03c6\u20323 ) * * * \u03c1\u2032 (\u03c6\u2032k , \u03c6\u2032k+1).\n\n(6)\n\nLet R \u00d7 M(1) , . . . , R \u00d7 M(k) be k copies of R \u00d7 M.

Performing a Gaussian integral, we find\nZ(Nk ) = Z0k (det DNk )\u22121/2 ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere Z0 is a constant independent of k.

We will later need the\n\nincomplete Gamma function for nonzero values of \u03b1 as well.\nWe choose ENk to be a unit operator times a constant with the dimension of inverse\nlength squared; this leads to vanishing of its contribution to the entropy.

This equation leads to several properties of\nthe entropy, which we now derive.\n\nC.\n\nSeveral Properties of Entropy\n\n1. Let (r, \u03b8) be local polar coordinates for Ck , and \u03be > 0. Under the scaling transformation (t, r, \u03b8) 7\u2192 (\u03be 2 t, \u03ber, \u03b8), we have Ck 7\u2192 Ck , t\u2206Ck 7\u2192 t\u2206Ck , and so K(t, \u2206Ck ) 7\u2192 K(t, \u2206Ck ).\nThis implies C(t) = C = const and thus\nSP (\u03bb) = 2\u22121 C\u0393(0, \u03bb2 m2 ).\n\n(23)\n\nWe will compute C in the next subsection and the appendix.\n2. Let (\u03c4 = x1 , x2 ) be local coordinates for Ck , let (x3 , . . . , xn ) be local coordinates for\n\u03a3, and let \u03be > 0. Under the transformation \u03bb 7\u2192 \u03be\u03bb, xj 7\u2192 \u03bexj , j = 3, . . . , n, we have\n\u2206\u03a3 7\u2192 \u2206\u03a3,\u03be = \u03be \u22122 \u2206\u03a3 and S\u03a3 (\u03bb) 7\u2192 S\u03a3,\u03be (\u03be\u03bb), where\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\nZ \u221e\n\u2202SP (\u03bc) \u2202SP (\u03be \u22121 \u03bc)\n\u2202S\u03a3 (\u03be \u22121 \u03bc)\nS\u03a3,\u03be (\u03be\u03bb) = \u2212\nd\u03bc\n.\n\u2202\u03bc\n\u2202(\u03be \u22121 \u03bc)\n\u2202(\u03be \u22121 \u03bc)\n\u03be\u03bb\n\n(24)\n\nUsing Eq.

Since vol (\u03a3) 7\u2192 \u03be n\u22122 vol (\u03a3), this implies\nS\u03a3 (\u03bb) \u223c C \u2032 \u03bb2\u2212n vol (\u03a3),\n\n\u03bb \u2192 0,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere C \u2032 = const.\n3. Since 0 is the smallest eigenvalue of \u2206\u03a3 , we have K(t, \u2206\u03a3 ) \u223c 1, t \u2192 \u221e.

(23) for SP (\u03bb) for arbitrary \u03bb. This\ncan be understood as the result of the physical scales of \u03a3 becoming irrelevant as the cutoff\n\u03bb tends to infinity.\n4. Let \u03a31 and \u03a32 be closed hypersurfaces in M. Let \u2202 and \u2202 \u22121 be operators defined by\n\u2202Mi\u2032 = \u03a3i and \u2202 \u22121 \u03a3i = Mi\u2032 , where Mi\u2032 is a part of M inside \u03a3i for i = 1, 2. Being an integral\nover \u03a3, the quantity K(t, \u2206\u03a3 ) is linear in \u03a3. It follows that\nK(t, \u2206\u03a31 ) + K(t, \u2206\u03a32 ) = K(t, \u2206\u2202(\u2202 \u22121 \u03a31 \u222a\u2202 \u22121 \u03a32 ) ) + K(t, \u2206\u2202(\u2202 \u22121 \u03a31 \u2229\u2202 \u22121 \u03a32 ) ),\n\n(28)\n\nand thus the entropy satisfies the additivity property\nS\u03a31 (\u03bb) + S\u03a32 (\u03bb) = S\u2202(\u2202 \u22121 \u03a31 \u222a\u2202 \u22121 \u03a32 ) (\u03bb) + S\u2202(\u2202 \u22121 \u03a31 \u2229\u2202 \u22121 \u03a32 ) (\u03bb).\n\n(29)\n\nSee Fig. 2. For an arbitrary system, the entanglement entropy satisfies the strong subadditivity property, which requires '\u2265' instead of '=' in Eq. (29).\n\nD.\n\nAsymptotics\n\nWe now derive the asymptotic expansion of S\u03a3 (\u03bb) for \u03bb \u2192 0. It is clear that this requires\nknowledge of the asymptotic behavior of K(t, \u2206\u03a3 ) for t \u2192 0. For an n-dimensional manifold\nL, such an asymptotic is given by\nK(t, \u2206L ) \u223c\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nt(l\u2212n)/2 al (\u2206L ),\n\nt \u2192 0,\n\n(30)\n\nl=0\n\nwhere\nal (\u2206L ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9L al (xL , \u2206L ),\n\nL\n\n9\n\n(31)\n\n\fand al (xL , \u2206L ) are the heat kernel coefficients for \u2206L . The above factorization of K(t, \u2206Nk )\nleads to\nal (xNk , \u2206Nk ) =\n\nl\nX\n\naj (xCk , \u2206Ck )al\u2212j (x\u03a3 , \u2206\u03a3 ).\n\n(32)\n\nj=0\n\nThe coefficients al (xL , \u2206L ) are completely determined by the geometry of L. For a manifold without boundary, al (xL , \u2206L ) = 0 for odd l. All coefficients al (xL , \u2206L ) are polynomials\nin the covariant derivatives of the Riemann tensor (RL )abcd , the Ricci tensor (RL )ab , and the\nscalar curvature RL of L. Explicit expressions for several first coefficients are available in\nthe literature (see, for example, Ref. [20]). For example,\na0 (xL , \u2206L ) = (4\u03c0)\u2212n/2 ,\n\n(33)\n\na2 (xL , \u2206L ) = (4\u03c0)\u2212n/2 6\u22121 RL ,\n\u0010\nX\n\u2212n/2\n\u22121\n(RL )ab (RL )ab\n\u221212\u2206L RL + 5RL2 \u2212 2\na4 (xL , \u2206L ) = (4\u03c0)\n360\n\n(34)\n\na,b\n\n+2\n\nX\n\n\u0011\n(RL )abcd (RL )abcd .\n\n(35)\n\na,b,c,d\n\nIt has been shown [22] that the only nonzero heat kernel coefficients for Ck are\na0 (xCk , \u2206Ck ) = (4\u03c0)\u22121 ,\n\n(36)\n\na2 (xCk , \u2206Ck ) = (4\u03c0)\u22121 6\u22121 4\u03c0(1 \u2212 k)\u03b4Ck ,\n\n(37)\n\nwhere \u03b4Ck is the delta function at the origin of Ck . This gives C = 6\u22121 . (In the appendix,\nwe derive this result.)

For \u03bb \u2192 0, S\u03a3 (\u03bb) depends only on the spectral\nproperties of the operator \u03bb2 D\u03a3 . Equivalently, the entropy depends only on parameters m,\n\u03bb, and on geometric invariants associated with \u03a3.

(See also Ref. [15] for a similar discussion.) The entanglement entropy for a critical 2-dimensional CFT with the central charge c is asymptotically\nS \u223c (c/3) log (l/\u03bb), where l is the size of the system [11]. For a massive theory with the\ncorrelation length \u03be, the entropy becomes S \u223c (c/6)\u03bd log (\u03be/\u03bb) for l \u226b \u03be, where \u03bd is the\nnumber of components of (zero dimensional) \u03a3. Setting c = 1, \u03bd = 1, \u03be \u223c m\u22121 , we recover\nEq. (41).\n\nIII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have calculated the asymptotic expansion of the entanglement entropy for a free scalar\nfield in arbitrary background geometry. The expansion parameter is the ultraviolet cutoff \u03bb\nwhich is needed to regularize the entropy. We have found that the entropy depends only on\ngeometric invariants associated with the boundary surface \u03a3. The extensive contribution to\nthe entropy, the term of order \u03bb\u2212n vol (N), is absent. The leading term is proportional to\n\u03bb2\u2212n vol (\u03a3).\nWe have considered a situation with spatial curvature only and with time included in\nonly a trivial way as a product. Our calculation does not utilize a spacetime that is a\nsolution of Einstein's equations. Further research may involve extending this calculation to\ncases involving spacetime curvature. Another interesting direction to pursue is to include\ninteractions since this, at least intuitively, can potentially change the area dependence of\nthe entropy. The studies of interactions have been mostly limited to CFTs, but their role\nin QFT remains largely unexplored. These cases involve gravity more explicitly and may\nmake a connection between holographic entropy and entanglement entropy more obvious.\n\n11\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Tom Kephart, Juan Maldacena, and Tadashi Takayanagi for discussions.

Under the transformation (t, r, \u03b8) 7\u2192 (\u03be 2 t, \u03ber, \u03b8), we have K(t, \u2206Ck ) 7\u2192 K(t, \u2206Ck ), al (\u2206Ck ) 7\u2192 \u03be 2\u2212l al (\u2206Ck ).\nSince Ck does not have a length scale associated with it, this implies a0 (\u2206Ck ) = \u221e,\na2 (\u2206Ck ) = const, al (\u2206Ck ) = 0, l \u2265 4. a0 (xCk , \u2206Ck ) is given by Eq.

We consider it as a limit Ck = lim\u03b5\u21920 Ck,\u03b5, where Ck,\u03b5\nis a regular manifold. On Ck,\u03b5 we take an orthonormal frame (\u03c9 1 , \u03c9 2) = (f dr, rd\u03b8), where\nthe regularization function f (k, r, \u03b5) is an arbitrary smooth function satisfying conditions\n\u00011/2\n,\nlimr\u21920 f = k, lim\u03b5\u21920 f = 1. An example of such a function is f = k 2 + (1 \u2212 k 2 )(qr)\u03b5\n\nwhere \u03b5 \u2265 0 and q > 0 is an arbitrary constant with the dimension of inverse length.
