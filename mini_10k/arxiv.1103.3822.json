Since the spacetime near a black hole is highly curved, particles-even\nlight-can not escape from the black hole at the classical level. However, quantum mechanics suggests that\nblack holes emits radiation like a black body with a finite\ntemperature known as the Hawking temperature. Therefore, the phenomenon of the absorption and radiation of\ngravitational waves in the strong gravitational field was\nstudied extensively (see, e.g., Refs. [1\u20137]).\nThe absorption cross section is one of the essential\nfactors in the absorption and radiation of gravitational\nwaves. As shown in [7], the total absorption cross section of an ordinary material sphere monotonically increases with the frequency, while, for a black hole, the absorption cross section approaches its constant geometricoptics value in an oscillatory way with the increasing of\nthe frequency. Thus, by examining the behavior of the\nabsorption cross section, we can distinguish a black hole\nfrom a material optical absorber. It also can be applied\nto distinguish different black holes, since the constant\ngeometric-optics value varies for different black holes.\nA study of the absorption cross section for different\nblack holes of arbitrary dimension, as well as for all kinds\nof fields, has been carried out. At low energy, it was\nshown that scalars have a cross section equal to the black\nhole horizon area and spin-1/2 particles give the area\nmeasured in a flat spatial metric conformally related to\nthe true metric [8]. At high energy, the absorption cross\nsection oscillates around a limiting constant value.

In [10], Decanini, Esposito-Farese and Folacci explained the fluctuations around the limiting value\nin terms of black hole parameters. Since then, the universal description of the high-energy absorption cross section\nfor the static and spherically symmetric black hole has\nbeen established.\nAs stated above, the limiting value of the high-energy\nabsorption cross section can be interpreted by the null\ngeodesics. On the other hand, the deflection angle of\nlight in a strong gravitational lensing is also computed\nthrough the null geodesics. As a result, it allows us to\nestablish a relation between the high-energy absorption\ncross section and the strong gravitational lensing (for the\ngravitational lensing, see Refs. [11\u201318]). In fact, there\nalso exists a connection between the strong gravitational\nlensing and the quasinormal modes of spherically symmetric black holes in the eikonal regime, which was first\nguessed by Decanini and Folacci [19] and was realized\nby Stefanov, Yazadjiev and Gyulchev [20], where they\nsuggested that we could read the gravitational waves we\ncould expect from a black hole through the connection established by them. In this current paper, we would like\nto go a step further. In the following, we will propose a\nrelation between the high-energy absorption cross section\nand the strong gravitational lensing. From this relation,\none can compute the total energy emission rate for highenergy particles emitted from a black hole. Then, it could\ntell us the range of frequency, among which the gravitational waves are most likely to be observed. We also apply it to the Schwarzschild black hole solution and the\nJanis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) solution. The results\nimply that we can test the cosmic censorship hypothesis through the observation of gravitational lensing by\n\n\f2\nthe weakly naked singularities, since there exists thermal\nradiation for the weakly naked singularities.\nNow, let us consider a static and spherically symmetric\nblack hole in D(\u2265 4)-dimensional spacetime with the line\nelement assumed as\nds2 = \u2212f (r)dt2 +\n\n1\ndr2 + r2 d\u03a92(D\u22122) ,\nf (r)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere d\u03a92(D\u22122) denotes the line element on the unit\n(D \u2212 2)-dimensional sphere S (D\u22122) , for which the usual\nangular coordinates are \u03b8i \u2208 [0, \u03c0] (i = 1, ..., D \u2212 3) and\n\u03c6 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0]. The metric function f (r) is imposed with\nthe proper asymptotics f (r \u2192 +\u221e) \u2192 1.\nNext, we consider a free photon orbiting around a black\nhole on the equatorial hyperplane defined by \u03b8i = \u03c02 for\ni = 1, ..., D \u2212 3. The t motion and \u03c6 motion are, respectively, associated with the Killing vectors \u2202/\u2202t and\n\u2202/\u2202\u03c6,\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\ndt\n2 d\u03c6\nE = f (r)\n, L=r\n,\n(2)\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\nwhere \u03c4 is an affine parameter, and E and L denote the\nenergy and the orbital angular momentum of the photon,\nrespectively. The r motion can be expressed as\n\u0012 \u00132\ndr\n+ Veff = 0,\n(3)\nd\u03c4\nwith the effective potential Veff given by\nVeff =\n\nL2\nf (r) \u2212 E 2 .\nr2\n\n(4)\n\nWithout loss of generality, we set E = 1. With the null\ngeodesic (2)-(3), we could obtain the photon sphere equation for the metric (1). On the other hand, the existence\nof the photon sphere in a space-time has important implications for the gravitational lensing (i.e., relativistic\nimages will be produced). So, we would like to give some\nnotes on the photon sphere. Virbhadra and Ellis, [13] as\nwell as Claudel et al. [21], gave several kinds of definitions of the photon sphere in a static spherically symmetric spacetime. One definition [13] of the photon sphere is\nthat it is a timelike hypersurface if the Einstein bending\nangle of a light ray will be unlimited when the closest distance of approach coincides with the photon sphere. An\nalternative definition was given in [21], where the photon\nsphere is well-defined when the spacetime admits a group\nof symmetries. Especially, Ref. [21] also contains some\ntheorems, which have important implications for astrophysics. These definitions give the same results, and the\nequivalence can be found in the recent paper [22]. In fact,\nthe photon sphere is known as an unstable circular of\nlight, which provides us a possible way to determine the\nphoton sphere through the effective potential (4). With\ndetailed analysis, the radius of the photon sphere is found\nto satisfied the three conditions\nVeff\n\nr=rc\n\n= 0,\n\n\u2032\nVeff\n\nr=rc\n\n= 0,\n\n\u2032\u2032\nVeff\n\nr=rc\n\n< 0,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere rc is the radius of the photon sphere and the prime\nindicates the derivative with respect to r. The first condition admits that the angular momentum L = \u221arfc and\nc\nthe second condition gives the photon sphere equation\nfor the black hole:\nrc fc\u2032 \u2212 2fc = 0.\n\n(6)\n\nThe subscript \"c\" represents that the metric coefficient\nf (r) is evaluated at rc . Solving Eq. (6), we can determine\nthe radius rc of the photon sphere. The photon sphere\nequation is consistent with these obtained by Virbhadra\net al. through different definitions. The unstable condition of the orbit is shown in the last condition. Combining with the second condition, we have the following\nunstable condition: fc\u2032\u2032 \u2212 r22 fc < 0. It is also clear that,\nc\nfrom the last two conditions, the photon sphere is located\nat the local maximum of the effective potential.\nIn the strong deflection limit, Bozza [23] showed that\nthe deflection angle can be expressed in the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b8DOL\n\u03b1(\u03b8) = \u2212\u0101 log\n\u2212 1 + b\u0304,\n(7)\nuc\nwhere \u03b8 is the angular position of the light source and\nDOL is the observer-lens distance. The minimum impact\nparameter uc and the strong deflection limit coefficients\n\u0101 and b\u0304 are given, in terms of the metric function f (r),\nby\ns\n2\nrc\n,\n(8)\nuc = L = \u221a ,\n\u0101 =\n2fc \u2212 rc2 fc\u2032\u2032\nfc\n\u0014\n\u00132 \u0015\n\u0012\n1\n1 \u2212 fc\nb\u0304 = \u2212\u03c0 + bR + \u0101 ln\n.\n(9)\n2fc3\n\u0101\nThe expression of the coefficient bR is in a complicated\nform, which can be found in [23]. In order to probe the\nnature of the lens from astronomical observations, we\nshould find the relation between these coefficients and\nthe astronomical observables. For the purpose of this,\nwe consider the case that the source, lens and observer\nare highly aligned. In this case, there is an infinite set of\nimages at both sides of the black hole. In the simplest\nsituation, we suppose that the outermost relativistic image with angular position \u03b81 is a single image and the\nrest are packed together at \u03b8\u221e . Then, we have [23]\n\u03b8\u221e =\n\nuc\n.\nDOL\n\n(10)\n\nThe angular separation s and the ratio of the flux r\u0303 between the first image and the other ones are\nb\u0304\u22122\u03c0\n\ns = \u03b81 \u2212 \u03b8\u221e = \u03b8\u221e e \u0101 ,\n\u221e\nX\nr\u0303 = \u03bc1 /\n\u03bcn = e2\u03c0/\u0101 .\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nn=1\n\nThe difference between the magnitudes of the outermost\nrelativistic image and the others rm is related to the flux\n\n\f3\nration r\u0303 in the following way: rm = 2.5 log r\u0303. Supposing\nthat the value of the distance DOL is known (later, we will\nshow that the distance DOL can also be obtained through\nthe gravitational lensing), we can obtain the observable\nquantities \u03b8\u221e , s and r\u0303 from the theoretical model. On the\nother hand, with the data from the astronomical observation, we can examine the consistency of the theoretical\nmodel and the astronomical observation.\nNow, let us turn to the high-energy absorption cross\nsection for black holes. In [10], a universal high-energy\nabsorption cross section for black holes was presented.\nBesides the limiting value, in the eikonal approximation,\nthe fluctuations around the limiting value are also analyzed using Regge pole techniques. The compact form of\nthe high-energy absorption cross section for a black hole\nwith metric (1) was given by [10]\n\u03c3abs (\u03c9) = \u03c3lim + \u03c3osc ,\n\n(13)\n\nwith the limiting value \u03c3lim of the absorption cross section \u03c3abs at \u03c9 \u2192 \u221e and the oscillating part \u03c3osc given\nby\n\u03c3lim = \u03c3geo =\n\n\u03c0\n\nD\u22122\n2\n\nbcD\u22122\n,\n\u0393(D/2)\n\n\u03c3osc (\u03c9) = (\u22121)D\u22123 4(D \u2212 2)\u03c0\u03b7c e\u2212\u03c0\u03b7c\n\nsin(\u03c9Tc )\n\u03c3geo ,\n\u03c9Tc\n\nwhere the orbital period Tc = 2\u03c0bc and \u03c3geo is the geometrical cross section. And the other two parameters\nare\nr\nrc\n1\n(14)\nbc = \u221a , \u03b7c = fc \u2212 rc2 fc\u2032\u2032 .\n2\nfc\nNote that the high-energy absorption cross section \u03c3abs\nonly depends on the parameters bc and \u03b7c . Thus, in order\nto obtain the relation between the high-energy absorption\ncross section and strong gravitational lensing, we just\nneed to express the parameters of the absorption cross\nsection in terms of the strong deflection limit coefficients.\nComparing these coefficients together, we get the simple\nrelations: bc = ucc , \u03b7c = \u01011 (the speed of light c has\nbeen restored). Furthermore, with the help of (10)-(12),\nthe absorption cross section coefficients, in terms of the\nobservables, read\nDOL \u03b8\u221e\n1\n, \u03b7c =\nln r\u0303.\n(15)\nc\n2\u03c0\nThus, we can rewritten the high-energy absorption cross\nsection (13) as\n\u0013D\u22123\n\u0012\n\u0010 2\u03c0\u03c9D \u03b8 \u0011\nDOL \u03b8\u221e\nK ln r\u0303\nOL \u221e\n\u221a *\nsin\n\u03c3abs (\u03c9) =\nc\nc\n\u03c9 r\u0303\n\u0012\u221a\n\u0013D\u22122\n1\n\u03c0DOL \u03b8\u221e\n+ D\n,\n(16)\nc\n\u0393( 2 )\nbc =\n\nwith the constant K = (\u22121)(D\u22123) (D \u2212 2)\u03c0 (D\u22124)/2 /\u0393( D\n2 ).\nHere, we have established the relation between the absorption cross section and the observables of strong gravitational lensing for black holes. This relation admits us\n\nto express the absorption cross section with these observables of the gravitational lensing.\nOn the other hand, the gravitational lensing also provides us a profound way to measure the distance between\nthe black hole lens and the observer. The method is due\nto the measurement of time delays between two consecutive relativistic images. From the method, the lensobserver distance is [24]\nDOL =\n\n2\u03c0c\u2206T2,1\n,\n\u03b8\u221e\n\n(17)\n\nwith \u2206T2,1 the time delay between the first relativistic\nimage and the second one. Substituting it back into (15),\nwe obtain bc = 2\u03c0\u2206T2,1 . At last, we arrive at the final\nexpression of the high-energy absorption cross section\n2\u03c0K ln r\u0303 sin(4\u03c0 2 \u03c9\u2206T2,1 )\n\u221a\n*\n4\u03c0 2 \u03c9\u2206T2,1\nr\u0303\n2D\u22122 \u03c0 (3D\u22126)/2 (\u2206T2,1 )D\u22122\n.\n(18)\n+\n\u0393( D\n2)\n\n\u03c3abs (\u03c9) = (2\u03c0\u2206T2,1 )D\u22122\n\nFurthermore, the absorption cross section was also\nfound to be related to the total energy emitted from the\nblack hole [25]. For a static and spherically symmetric\nblack hole of arbitrary dimension, the total energy per\nunit time and energy interval d\u03c9 is\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\nD\u22121\n2\u03c3abs (\u03c9) D\u22121\nd2 E(\u03c9)\nD \u2212 1\u0001\n2\n= (4\u03c0)\n\u0393\n\u03c9\n, (19)\n\u03c9\nd\u03c9dt\n2\ne TH \u2212 1\n\nwhere TH is the Hawking temperature of the black hole.\nThrough the detailed analysis, it could tell us the range\nof the frequency, among which the radiation energy dominates a very large percentage in the total energy.\nHere, we would like to study the energy emission rate\nfor the Schwarzschild black hole solution and the JNW\nsolution. The JNW solution [26] is the most general\nstatic spherically symmetric solution to the Einstein\u2013\nmassless scalar equations, and its convenient form was\npresented in [27], which reads\n\u0013\u03bd\n\u0013\u2212\u03bd\n\u0012\n\u0012\nb\nb\n2\n2\ndt \u2212 1 \u2212\ndr2\nds = 1 \u2212\nr\nr\n\u00131\u2212\u03bd\n\u0012\nb\nr2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ), (20)\n\u2212 1\u2212\nr\np\n1\nQ\nis\nwhere \u03bd = (1 + q 2 )\u2212 2 , b =\n1 + q 2 rs , q = M\nthe charge per unit mass M of the black hole, and\nthe Schwarzschild radius rs = 2M . The scalar field of\n\u221a\nthis spacetime reads \u03a6 = bqM\nln(1 \u2212 rb ). The solution\n4\u03c0\n(20) is asymptotically Minkowskian and reduces to the\nSchwarzschild solution for q = 0 or \u03bd = 1. As shown in\n[28], this solution has a globally naked strong curvature\nsingularity at r = b for all values of q 6= 0 and it satisfies\nthe weak energy condition. According to [12, 21, 29], the\nphoton sphere of the JNW spacetime is\n1 + 2\u03bd\n1p\nrps =\n1 + q 2 )rs .\nb = (1 +\n(21)\n2\n2\n\n\f4\nSince the curvature singularity is at r = b, the photon\n\u221a\nsphere exists only for 1/2 < \u03bd \u2264 1 (or 0 \u2264 q < 3).\nTherefore, according to the classification presented by\nVirbhadra et al. [29, 30], JNW naked singularities are referred to as weakly, \u221a\nmarginally,\n\u221a and strongly\n\u221a naked singularities for 0 \u2264 q < 3, q = 3, and q > 3, respectively.\nIn fact, the weakly naked singularities are those singularities which are contained within at least one photon\nsphere, while the marginally and strongly naked ones are\nthose which are not covered within any photon spheres.\nGravitational lensing by the JNW solution has been studied in [23, 29, 30]. All these results show that the lensing features of weakly and marginally naked singularities\nare qualitatively similar to the Schwarzschild black hole,\nwhile the lensing due to the strongly naked singularities is\nqualitatively very different from the Schwarzschild black\nhole.\nFor the JNW solution, we suppose that the discussion\nabove and (13) are held. Then its total high-energy absorption cross section reads\n\u03c3abs = \u03c0 2 bc \u2212\n\n4\u03c0bc \u03b7e\u2212\u03c0\u03b7 sin(2\u03c0b\u03c9)\n,\n\u03c9\n\n(22)\n\n\u03a3abs @ Ah D\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n\nq=0.0\nq=0.4\nq=0.8\nq=1.2\n\n0.5\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n3.0\n\n\u03a9rh\n\n\u03a3lim @ Ah D\n4.0\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n(1.17,1.24)\n\n1.5\n\np\n(23)\nbc = (2 + 1 + q 2 )rs /2H,\nq\n.\np\n\u03b7 = H q 4 \u2212 4q 2 + 8 1 + q 2 + 19 |3 \u2212 q 2 |, (24)\n\np\n\u0003 \u221a1\nwith H = (q 2 \u2212 4 1 + q 2 + 5)/(3 \u2212 q 2 ) 2 1+q2 . The\ntotal absorption cross section and its limiting values are\ndescribed in Fig. 1. From Fig. 1(a), we can see that\nthe absorption cross section of the JNW solution oscillates around a limiting constant value, which is just the\ngeometrical cross section. It was shown in [10] that, at\nthe high-energy case, the behavior of the total absorption cross section (13) is consistent with the exact one.\nThe limiting values are also found to vary with the charge\ndensity q, and the behavior of limiting values is presented\nin Fig. 1(b). We find that the limiting value decreases\nwith the charge density q from 0 to 1.17. When q further\nincreases, \u03c3lim will increase. All these results describe\nthe Schwarzschild black hole case when q = 0. It is\nalso worth noting that these results are for the weakly\nnaked singularities. For the marginally naked singularities, the limiting value will be unlimited, and for the\nstrongly naked ones, there is no absorption cross section.\nFrom (19), we could see that the absorption cross section\nhas an impact on the energy emission rate. Besides it,\nthe Hawking temperature TH also has an effect on the energy emission rate. For the JNW solution, the Hawking\ntemperature TH is calculated as\n\u0002\n\n1\n.\n4\u03c0(1 + q 2 )rs\n\n2.5\n\n(a)\n\nwhere\n\nTH =\n\n2.0\n\n(25)\n\nWhen q = 0, it describes the temperature of the\n1\n.

The result displays that, when the charge density q in2\nE(\u03c9)\ncreases, the peak of (rh d d\u03c9dt\n) decreases and the value of\n\u03c9rh corresponding to the peak approaches zero. These\nresults are for the weakly naked singularities. For the\nmarginally and strongly naked singularities, there is no\nenergy emission rate, which means that there is no thermal radiation for these naked singularities, while there\nis thermal radiation for the weakly naked singularities.\nWith this result and the relation (18), we are allowed to\ntest the cosmic censorship hypothesis through the gravitational lensing by the weakly naked singularities.\nAt the end of this paper, we would like to make a few\ncomments on the possible applications of the relation between the parameters of the strong gravitational lensing and the high-energy absorption cross section in the\neikonal regime presented in the current paper.

The data analysis of them may provide us\nwith the range of the frequency for gravitational waves,\namong which the gravitational source emits the most of\nits energy.

Furthermore, we also compute the energy emission rate for the\nSchwarzschild black hole solution and the JNW solution.\nThe results show that, for the weakly naked singularities, there is thermal radiation, which is like that of the\nSchwarzschild black hole, while, for the marginally and\nstrongly naked singularities, there is no thermal radiation. Thus, these results could provide us with a possible\nway to test the cosmic censorship hypothesis through the\nobservation of gravitational lensing by the weakly naked\nsingularities acting as gravitational lenses. Another possible application of the result is to determine the dimension D of the spacetime. This may offer us the information about the extra dimensional theories presented in\n[31, 32].\nThe authors are extremely grateful for the anonymous referee, who suggested that the authors compute\nand compare results for black holes-weakly, marginally,\nand strongly naked singularities-and whose suggestion\nhelped the authors obtain an important result.
