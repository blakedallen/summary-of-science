It is shown that the bound on\nthe negative energies diverges to minus infinity as the event horizon or initial singularity\nis approached. Thus, neglecting back reaction, negative energies become unconstrained\nnear the horizon or initial singularity. The results of this paper also support the hypothesis that the quantum interest conjecture applies only to deviations from the vacuum\npolarization energy, not to the total energy.\n\n1\n\n\fIntroduction\nIn classical physics it is expected that the energy-momentum tensor will satisfy the\nweak energy condition T\u03bc\u03bd V \u03bc V \u03bd \u2265 0 for all timelike vectors V \u03bc (see [1] for exceptions).\nThis condition ensures that all observers measure a positive energy density. However,\nin quantum field theory there exist states for which the expectation value of the energymomentum tensor violates the weak energy condition. Such exotic matter is of interest\nsince it is required to maintain wormholes [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and to create warp drives\n[8, 9].\nOver the past decade Ford and Roman [10, 11, 12] have studied the properties of\nexotic matter extensively. In four dimensional flat spacetime they have shown that\nmassless bosonic fields satisfy the quantum inequalities\n\u03c1\u0302 =\n\nt0\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n3A\n< Ttt >\ndt\n\u2265\n\u2212\n2\n(t2 + t0 )\n32\u03c0 2 t40\n\n(1)\n\nwhere < Ttt > is the expectation value of the normal ordered energy density, A = 1 for\nmassless scalar fields, and A = 2 for the electromagnetic field. The quantity \u03c1\u0302 samples\n< Ttt > over a time interval of order t0 using the sampling function h(t) = t0 /[\u03c0(t2 + t20 )].\nThese quantum inequalities show that an observer can measure a negative energy density\n<\nfor a time \u223c |\u03c1|\u22121/4 . In two dimensional flat spacetime they found that\n\u03c1\u0302 \u2265 \u2212\n\n1\n8\u03c0t20\n\n(2)\n\nfor a massless scalar field. The bounds found by Ford and Roman are not optimal\nbounds. In two dimensional flat spacetime Flanagan [13] has shown that the optimal\nbound for a scalar field is given by\n1\n\u03c1\u0302 \u2265 \u2212\n24\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2032\n\nh (t)2\ndt\nh(t)\n\n(3)\n\n\u221e\nwhere h(t) is any sampling function that satisfies h(t) \u2265 0 and \u2212\u221e\nh(t)dt = 1. Nonoptimal quantum inequalities have also been found for scalar fields in static RobertsonWalker, de Sitter, and Schwarzschild spacetimes [17, 18, 19].\nSome work has also been done on negative energy density states for the Dirac equation\nin four dimensional Minkowski space. In an earlier paper [14] I examined a class of states\nthat produced violations of the weak energy condition and showed that they satisfied a\nquantum inequality of the form (1).\nIn this paper I show that (2) is also an optimal bound for the massless Dirac field in\ntwo dimensional flat spacetimes. I also find the optimal bound for massless Dirac and\nscalar fields in two dimensional curved spacetimes with a conformal factor dependent on\nx only or on t only. These results are then applied to two dimensional black hole and\ncosmological spacetimes. It is shown that the bound on the negative energies diverges to\n\nR\n\n2\n\n\fminus infinity (neglecting back reaction) as the event horizon or cosmological singularity\nis approached. Thus, the negative energies become unconstrained near the horizon or\nthe initial singularity.\nThe quantum inequalities derived in this paper can also be used to support the\nquantum interest conjecture [15]. According to this conjecture any negative energy flux\nmust be preceded or followed by a larger positive energy flux (i.e. the negative flux\nmust be repaid with interest by the positive flux). Pretorius [16] has shown that the\nquantum interest conjecture for scalar fields in Minkowski space follows from the scaling\nproperties of the corresponding quantum inequalities. Since the Dirac equation satisfies\nthe same quantum inequalities in two dimensional Minkowski space it will also satisfy\nthe quantum interest conjecture. Pretorius also conjectured that in curved spacetime\nthe quantum interest conjecture applies only to deviations from the ground state, not\nto the total energy. This conjecture is shown to be true for the spacetimes examined in\nthis paper. I will take h\u0304 = c = G = 1 throughout this paper.\n\nThe Energy-Momentum Tensor\nIn any two dimensional spacetime the metric can be taken to have the conformally flat\nform\nds2 = C(x, t)[dt2 \u2212 dx2 ].\n(4)\nIn null coordinates (u = t \u2212 x, v = t + x) the metric becomes\nds2 = C(u, v)dudv.\n\n(5)\n\nThe conservation laws \u2207\u03bc T \u03bc\u03bd = 0 give\n1 \u2202 h\u221a \u03b1 i 1\ngT \u03b2 = T \u2202\u03b2 (ln C)\n\u221a\ng \u2202x\u03b1\n2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere T = T \u03b1\u03b1 and T \u03b1\u03b2 is the energy-momentum tensor. Using T uu = T vv = 21 T and\nTuu = 21 CT vu , Tvv = 21 CT uv we find that\n1\n\u2202v Tuu = \u2212 C\u2202u T\n4\nand\n\n(7)\n\n1\n\u2202u Tvv = \u2212 C\u2202v T.\n(8)\n4\nThus in flat spacetime, where the conformal anomally vanishes (i.e. T = 0), a conformally invariant theory, such as the massless scalar or Dirac field, will have Tuu = Tuu (u),\nTvv = Tvv (v), and Tuv = 0. This can be seen explicitly for the massless scalar and Dirac\nfields.\n\n3\n\n\fThe scalar field equation \u27372 \u03c6 = 0 has the general solution \u03c6(u, v) = \u03c6u (u) + \u03c6v (v)\nand the energy-momentum tensor has the components Tuu = (\u2202u \u03c6u )2 , Tvv = (\u2202v \u03c6v )2 ,\nand Tuv = 0.\nThe massless Dirac equation\ni\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8 = 0\n(9)\nwith\n\u03b30 =\nand\n1\n\n\u03b3 =\n\n0\ni\n\n\u2212i\n0\n\n0\ni\n\ni\n0\n\n!\n\n(10)\n\n!\n\n(11)\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nhas the general solution\n\u03c8=\n\n\"\n\n\u03c8u (u)\n\u03c8v (v)\n\n#\n\nThe energy-momentum tensor is given by\ni\nTuu = [\u03c8u\u2020 \u2202u \u03c8u \u2212 (\u2202u \u03c8u\u2020 )\u03c8u ],\n2\n\n(13)\n\ni\nTvv = [\u03c8v\u2020 \u2202v \u03c8v \u2212 (\u2202v \u03c8v\u2020 )\u03c8v ],\n(14)\n2\nand Tuv = 0. Note that \u03c8 can be taken to be real since the gamma matrices are purely\nimaginary. For a discussion of the 1+1 dimensional Dirac equation see chapter four\nof Green, Schwarz, and Witten [20]. Both of these energy-momentum tensors satisfy\nTuu = Tuu (u), Tvv = Tvv (v), and Tuv = 0.\n\nQuantum Inequalities\nConsider two conformally related spacetimes, one with metric\nds2 = C(x, t)[dt2 \u2212 dx2 ]\n\n(15)\n\nand the other one with C(x, t) = 1.

Thus, neglecting back reaction, the negative energy\ndensities become unconstrained in regions where C \u2192 0.\n\nBlack Hole and Cosmological Spacetimes\nConsider the two dimensional black hole spacetime\n\u0012\n\nds2 = 1 \u2212\n\n2m\n2m\ndt2 \u2212 1 \u2212\nr\u0304\nr\u0304\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\ndr\u0304 2 .\n\n(37)\n\nIn conformally flat coordinates\n#\n\n\"\n\n2m\n(dt2 \u2212 dr 2 )\nds2 = 1 \u2212\nr\u0304(r)\n\n(38)\n\nwhere r\u0304(r) is defined via\n\nr\u0304\n\u22121 .\n2m\nNote that the horizon is at r\u0304 = 2m and at r \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\nNow consider an observer at rest near the horizon.

Note\nthat Ct is the proper time measured by the observer. The function has a maximum\nheight of 1/(\u03c0\u03c40 ) and a proper width of \u223c \u03c40 .

It is instead the quantum state exterior to a static mass distribution\nthat is larger than its Schwarzschild radius. I will take the mass distribution to be\nonly slightly larger than its Schwarzschild radius (of course, the matter will be under\narbitrarily large stresses which is physically unrealistic). For a metric of the form\nds2 = f (r\u0304)dt2 \u2212\n\n1\ndr\u0304 2\nf (r\u0304)\n\n(45)\n\nthe energy density in the Boulware state is given by [26]\n\u2032\n\n(f )2\n1\n\u2032\u2032\nf \u2212\n.\n\u03c1B =\n24\u03c0\n4f\n\"\n\n#\n\n(46)\n\nNote that this will be the energy density in the (r, t) coordinate system since \u03c1 = \u2212T tt\nis unaffected by changes in the radial coordinate. For f = (1 \u2212 2m/r\u0304) we have\n\u03c1B = \u2212\n\n1\n2m\n1\n\u2212\n384\u03c0m2\nr\u0304\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n(47)\n\nnear the horizon. This is just the second term on the left hand side of (41). Thus the\nBoulware state satisfies the quantum inequality (41), as it must.\nNow consider the cosmological spacetime\nh\n\nds2 = tn dt2 \u2212 dx2\n\ni\n\nn > 0.\n\n(48)\n\nn2 \u2212(n+2)\nt\n48\u03c0\n\n(49)\n\nThe last term on the right hand side of (36) is\n1\n\u2212\n48\u03c0C\n\n\u2202t C\nC\n\n!2\n\n=\u2212\n\nwhich diverges as t \u2192 0. Thus as we approach the initial singularity the negative energy\ndensities become unconstrained. Of course, as one approaches the initial singularity\nquantum gravity effects are expected to become important and the above analysis will\nbreak down.\n\n8\n\n\fConclusion\nOptimal quantum inequalities were derived for scalar and Dirac fields in two dimensional\nspacetimes in which the conformal factor is a function of x only or of t only. For\nspacetimes with a metric of the form\nds2 = C(x)(dt2 \u2212 dx2 )\n\n(50)\n\nit was shown that the energy density satisfies the optimal bound\n1\n\u03c1\u0302 =\nh(t) < Ttt > dt \u2265 \u2212\n24\u03c0C\n\u2212\u221e\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\"Z\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2032\n\n1\n1\nh (t)2\ndt + 4C 4 \u22022x (C \u2212 4 )\nh(t)\n\n#\n\n(51)\n\n\u221e\nwhere h(t) is a sampling function that satisfies h(t) \u2265 0 and \u2212\u221e\nh(t)dt = 1. A similar\nquantum inequality was also found when the conformal factor is a function of time only.\nThese inequalities were then applied to black hole and cosmological spacetimes. It was\nshown that the bound on the negative energies diverges to minus infinity as the horizon\nor initial singularity is approached. Thus, neglecting back reaction, the negative energy\ndensities become unconstrained near the horizon or initial singularity.\nI also showed that the quantum interest conjecture holds for scalar and Dirac fields in\ntwo dimensional Minkowski space and that in curved spacetimes this conjecture applies\nto deviations from the vacuum polarization energy, not to the total energy.\n\nR\n\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank Werner Israel, Shinji Mukohyama, Frans Pretorius, and Thomas\nRoman for many interesting discussions on negative energy densities.\n\nReferences\n[1] D.N.
