An initially\nantiferromagnetic ground state changes into a field-induced metamagnetic phase at \u223c 16 kOe\n(T \u2192 0). On further increase of magnetic field, magnetic order is suppressed at \u223c 85 kOe. The\nfunctional behaviors of the resistivity and specific heat are discussed in comparison with those of\nthe few other stoichiometric, heavy fermion compounds with established field-induced quantum\ncritical point.\nPACS numbers: 72.15.Qm,75.20.Hr,75.30.Kz\n\n1\n\n\fThe \"quantum criticality conundrum\"1 continues to be a focus of attention for many\ntheorists and experimentalists.2,3,4,5,6,7,8 In the particular case of magnetic intermetallic compounds that manifest heavy fermion ground states, magnetic ordering temperatures can be\ntuned by some control parameter to T = 0, bringing the material to a quantum critical\npoint (QCP). This tuning is possible because of a delicate balance between the Ruderman\n- Kittel - Kasuya - Yoshida (RKKY) interaction, that defines the magnetic ordering temperature, and the Kondo effect, that causes screening of the magnetic moments and favors\nnon-magnetic ground state.9 Recently, in addition to traditionally used pressure and chemical substitution, magnetic field has also emerged as a potential control parameter,2,6 having\nan advantage of being a continuous and common parameter for a number of experimental\ntechniques. However, the applicability of a single theoretical description for a QCP reached\nby using different tuning parameters, is still under discussion.\nSo far the number of stoichiometric materials exhibiting a field-induced QCP is rather\nsmall, with only few of them being Yb-based: YbRh2 Si2 ,10 YbAgGe,11 YbPtIn,12 . The\nrelease of entropy associated with the magnetic ordering (which can be used as a rough\ncaliper of the sise of the Yb magnetic moment in the ordered state) in the three materials\nranges from \u223c 0.01R ln 2 for YbRh2 Si2 , to \u2264 0.1R ln 2 for YbAgGe, to \u223c 0.6R ln 2 for\nYbPtIn. Nevertheless the H \u2212 T phase diagrams and functional behavior of a number of\nphysical parameters in the vicinity of the field-induced QCP are very similar for all three of\nthese compounds. Recently investigated YbNiSi3 ,13 an orthorhombic, moderately - heavy\nfermion compound with the N\u00e9el temperature, TN = 5.1 K, Sommerfeld coefficient, \u03b3 \u2248 190\nmJ/mol K2 , and entropy associated with the magnetic ordering \u223c 0.6R ln 2, seems to be\na suitable candidate for further studies of the possible field-induced quantum criticality in\nstoichiometric, Yb-based, heavy fermions.\nSingle crystals of YbNiSi3 were grown from Sn flux (see Ref. 13 for more details). Flux\nresidue from the surface of the samples was polished or/and etched out to exclude the effect of\nelemental Sn on measured electrical transport properties. DC magnetization was measured\nup to 55 kOe and down to 1.8 K in a Quantum Design MPMS-5 SQUID magnetometer. Heat\ncapacity and standard, 4-probe, AC (f = 16 Hz) resistivity in zero and applied field up to\n140 kOe were measured in a Quantum Design PPMS-14 instrument using a 3 He refrigerator\nwith heat capacity and ACT options respectively. In all measurements an external field was\napplied along easy magnetic axis (Hkb).13 Resistivity in applied field was measured in a\n2\n\n\ftransverse, H \u22a5 I, configuration.\nThe low field magnetic susceptibility, \u03c7 = M/H, measurements and 2 K magnetization,\nM(H), isotherms are consistent with the data reported in Ref. 13. The feature associated\nwith the antiferromagnetic transition in \u03c7 (or in d(\u03c7T )/dT )14 shifts to lower temperatures\nwith increase of the magnetic field applied (Fig. 1). The lower field metamagnetic transition\n(Fig. 2) moves to lower fields with increase of temperature at which the M(H) data were\ntaken, at higher temperatures the second feature moves to accessible field range (upper\nleft inset to Fig. 2); this feature corresponds to high field break in M(H) slope reported\npreviously13 .\nField-dependent resistivity isotherms are shown in Fig. 3. Two features (marked with\ndashed lines), consistent with those seen in aforementioned magnetization (M(H)) measurements, are easily recognizable and can be monitored in the H \u2212T domain of the experiments.\nThe position of the lower field feature is almost temperature-independent, while the critical\nfield associated with the higher field feature decreases with an increase of temperature.\nRepresentative-temperature dependent resistivity, \u03c1(T ), curves are shown in Fig 4. No\ntraces of the signal from residual Sn flux are seen in H = 0 data. The resistivity at base\ntemperature, T \u2248 400 mK, in zero field is \u2248 2\u03bc\u03a9 cm, consistent with \u03c10 = 1.5\u03bc\u03a9 cm\nobtained from \u03c1 = \u03c10 + AT 2 fit in [13]. A clear break of the \u03c1(T ) slope and the lower\ntemperature decrease of resistivity below the magnetic ordering temperature, TN , associated\nwith a loss of spin-disorder scattering is observed up to 70 kOe. At higher fields no signature\nof magnetic transition can be seen. Moreover, there in no clear signature of traditional form\nof non-Fermi-liquid behavior (linear or close-to-linear temperature dependence of resistivity)\nat fields close to the one at which TN is suppressed to T = 0 (Fig. 4, inset).\nThe temperature-dependent heat capacity is shown in Fig. 5. Results in zero field are\nconsistent with the published data.13 Consistent to aforesaid, the peak in Cp (T ) moves down\nwith an increase of the applied magnetic field, it's height decreases, and it is not recognized\nin the data at 80 kOe and above. Closer examination of H = 70 kOe curve (Fig. 5b) reveals\nthat the peak associated with the magnetic long range order is located on a background with\na broad maximum. It is seen with more clarity if Cp /T is plotted as a function of temperature\n(inset to Fig. 5b). This broad maximum moves up in temperature and acquires structure\nwith an increase of applied field: the data for H = 120 and 140 kOe can be deconvoluted\nto up to three broad peaks. For H \u2264 50 kOe these broad non-monotonic background is\n3\n\n\fprobably obscured by the feature in Cp (T ) associated with the magnetic transition. The\nplausible explanation for these broad features is that they are Schottky-like contributions\nto the specific heat: the the degeneracy of crystal-electric-field-defined lower energy levels\nof YbNiSi3 (e.g. a quadruplet or two closely spaced doublets) is lifted by the Zeeman term\nof the hamiltonian, and the energy difference between different levels increases further on\nincrease of the applied field. This explanation is in in dispute with the assumption of the\ndoublet ground state of YbNiSi3 13 and calls for additional studies.\nIn order to evaluate the change of the electronic specific heat coefficient, \u03b3, heat capacity\ndata are re-plotted as Cp /T vs. T 2 in Fig. 6. The small upturn at low temperatures (left\ninset to Fig. 6) that becomes more pronounced at higher fields is probably associated with\nthe nuclear Schottky contribution to the specific heat. The Sommerfeld coefficient in the\nspecific heat, \u03b3, can be estimated by extrapolating the high temperature linear part of the\nCp /T vs. T 2 curves to T = 0 (dashed line in Fig. 6). As a result of such procedure \u03b3 \u2248 250\nmJ/mol K2 , practically independent of the applied field can be assessed. This value is close\nto the estimate in Ref. 13 for H = 0. However, this estimate exceeds significantly the\nvalues of Cp /T measured in T \u2192 0 regime for magnetic fields in which the magnetic order\nis suppressed, pointing out that, at least for 70 kOe \u2264 H \u2264 140 kOe, high temperature\nextrapolation of Cp /T vs. T 2 is not an unique estimate of \u03b3. This brings back the question\nof the estimate of the entropy associated with the magnetic transition13 and may point out\nthat (in lieu of the data on non-magnetic analogue) the non-magnetic contribution, taken as\nextrapolation from above 10 K, was overestimated and the cited value of \u2206Smag \u223c 0.6R ln 2\nwas underestimated.\nOperationally, one can take the extrapolation to T \u2192 0 of the lowest temperature\nmeasurements plotted as Cp /T vs. T 2 , see left inset to Fig. 6 (ignoring the nuclear Schottky\ncontribution), as an estimate of \u03b3. The obtained values (right inset to Fig. 6) seem to\nfollow the trend generally observed in materials close to QCP10,11,12,15,16 . However, at least\nin the particular case of YbNiSi3 , one cannot discard the possibility that the shifts of the\nSchottky-like peaks to higher temperatures with an increase of the applied field leads to\na decreasing contribution (since it is taken further from the maximum) to the apparent\n\u03b3 = Cp /T |T \u21920, and genuine behavior of the Sommerfeld coefficient is masked by this fastly\nchanging contribution.\n\n4\n\n\fThe thermodynamic and transport measurements on YbNiSi3 in magnetic field applied\nalong the b-axis define the H \u2212 T phase diagram (Fig. 7). This phase diagram is consistent\n(in overlapping H \u2212 T domains) with the one recently suggested17 from magnetoresistance\nisotherms for T \u2265 1.85 K. The phase diagram is rather simple, with only two phases in\nthe ordered state, and a triple point. The positions of the Schottky-like anomalies are also\nshown, depending on the applied field in a close to linear fashion. A magnetic field of \u223c 85\nkOe suppresses the long range order, making the phase diagram look similarly to the cases of\nfield-induced QCP recently discussed in several materials.10,11,12,15,16 Further understanding\nof the low temperature state of YbNiSi3 in applied field can be approached by detailed\nanalysis of the magnetotransport and thermodynamic data.\nLow temperature resistivity (\u03c1(T )) data measured in magnetic field were fitted with\nthe equation \u03c1(T ) = \u03c10 + AT \u03b2 (as e.g. in Ref. 18) with three fitting parameters: residual\nresistivity, \u03c10 , pre-factor, A, and exponent, \u03b2. Two sets of fits were performed: from 3 K\ndown to base temperature (\u2248 0.4 K) and from 1.5 K down to base temperature. Both sets of\nfits are giving similar results (Fig. 8). All three fitting parameters have features associated\nwith the critical fields, the lower critical field being essentially temperature-independent\nbelow 3 K and the upper one only shifting slightly as T decreases from 3 K to 1.5 K (as\ncan be seen in A and \u03b2). It is noteworthy that the exponent \u03b2 as calculated from the data\nabove \u2248 0.4 K, does not fall below \u03b2 = 2, and the changes in \u03b2 as obtained from the 0.4\nK \u2265 T \u2265 1.5 K are rather small (Fig. 8, upper panel). This is clearly different from the\ncase of field-induced QCP in YbRh2 Si2 ,10,15 YbAgGe11,18 and other materials, although it\nis possible that \u03b2 approaches 1.0 for T < 0.4 K, and in a very narrow field range.\n\nIn summary, thermodynamic and transport measurements on YbNiSi3 (Hkb) reveal H \u2212T\nphase diagram with two distinct, antiferromagnetic and metamagnetic, ordered phases and\na triple point. An applied magnetic field of \u223c 85 kOe suppresses the magnetic ordering\ntemperature. As distinct from several known heavy fermions with field induced QCP, above\n400 mK no non-Fermi-signature in resistivity was observed in the vicinity of the critical\nfield for T \u2265 0.4 K, although they may well emerge for T < 0.4 K data. Heat capacity\nmeasurements suggest that applied magnetic field splits degenerate ground state of YbNiSi3\nand this field-dependent split of the energy levels manifest itself as Schottky-like anomalies.\nAdditionally, possible artifacts in assessing of the Sommerfeld coefficient from heat capacity\n5\n\n\fmeasurements, that have relevance beyond this particular compound, were disclosed.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nAmes Laboratory is operated for the U.S. Department of Energy by Iowa State University under Contract No. W-7405-Eng.-82.
