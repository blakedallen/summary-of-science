Although cosmological constant is the simplest candidate of dark energy consistent with current observations,\nit suffers from a severe fine-tuning problem from a field theoretic point of view [4]. It is then tempting to find alternative\nmodels of dark energy which have dynamical nature unlike cosmological constant. An accelerated expansion can be\nrealized by using a scalar field whose origin may be found in superstring or supergravity theories. Thus modern particle\nphysics has been an attractive supplier for the construction of scalar-field dark energy models\u2013such as quintessence\n[5], K-essence [6], tachyon [7], dilatonic models [8], and ghost condensate [9, 10].\nAlthough the dynamically evolving field models have an edge over the cosmological constant scenario, they too, in\ngeneral, involve fine-tuning of initial values of the field and the parameters of the model. Secondly, nucleosynthesis\nplaces stringent restriction on any additional degree of freedom (over and above the particle physics standard model\ndegrees of freedom) which translates into a constraint on the ratio of the field energy density to the energy density\nof the background fluid [3]. These problems can be addressed by employing scalar field models exhibiting scaling\nsolutions [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. For instance, a standard scalar field \u03c6 with an exponential potential in General\nRelativity (GR) [11, 12] can mimic the background (radiation/matter) remaining sub-dominant so as to respect the\nnucleosynthesis constraint [17]. The scaling solutions as dynamical attractors can successfully address the second\nproblem and can also considerably alleviate the fine-tuning problem of initial conditions.\nFor a viable cosmological evolution, the scalar field should remain unimportant for most of the cosmic evolution\nand should emerge from the hiding epoch only at late times to give rise to the accelerated expansion. Since scaling\nsolutions are non-accelerating, the model should be supplemented by an additional mechanism allowing the field to\nexit from the scaling regime at late times. There are several ways of achieving this goal:\n\u2022 (i) At late times the potential becomes shallow to lead to the accelerated expansion. For example this is realized\nby the double exponential potential given by V (\u03c6) = V0 (e\u2212\u03bb\u03ba\u03c6 + e\u2212\u03bc\u03ba\u03c6 ) with \u03bb2 > 20 and \u03bc2 < 2 [17] (here\n\u03ba2 = 8\u03c0G with G being gravitational constant).\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: shinji@nat.gunma-ct.ac.jp\naddress: sami@iucaa.ernet.in\n\n\f2\n\u2022 (ii) A local minimum of the field potential appears at late times. The examples of this type of models are\nV (\u03c6) = V0 [cosh(\u03bb\u03ba\u03c6) \u2212 1]n [18] and V (\u03c6) = V0 e\u2212\u03bb\u03ba\u03c6 [A + (\u03ba\u03c6 \u2212 B)2 ] [19]. In the former case the acceleration\noccurs for n < 1/2 on average, whereas in the latter case the system always approaches a de-Sitter universe\nafter a damped oscillation of the field.\n\u2022 (iii) Assisted quintessence\n[20]. This is realized by considering many fields \u03c6i with the sum of the exponential\nP\n\u2212\u03bbi \u03ba\u03c6i\n, since the presence of many scalar fields leads to the smaller effective coupling, i.e.,\npotential\nV\n=\nA\ne\ni\nP \u22122\n\u03bb\u22122\n=\n\u03bb\n[21].\ni\neff\n\nAlthough these are interesting attempts to provide a successful exit from the scaling regime, it is fair to say that\nthe aforementioned mechanisms are still phenomenological. It is of great importance to find cosmological models from\nfundamental theories of particle physics like string theory which may incorporate the findings of the phenomenological\nstudies. String theory necessarily includes scalar fields (dilaton & modulus fields); the low energy string effective\naction also gives rise to a modification of standard GR in terms of Riemann invariants coupled to scalar field(s)\n[22]. The modifications are important to address the problems of past [23] and future [24] singularities. Out of these\ncorrections, the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) term is of a special relevance. The GB term is a topological invariant quantity\nwhich contributes to the dynamics in 4 dimensions provided it is coupled to a dynamically evolving scalar field. It\nis the unique invariant for which the highest (second) derivative occurs linearly in the equations of motion thereby\nensuring the uniqueness of solutions. Nojiri et al. [25] studied scalar-Gauss-Bonnet cosmology to demonstrate the\nexistence of a particular dark energy solution. Such a solution exists in the presence of an exponential potential\nV (\u03c6) \u221d e\u2212\u03bb\u03ba\u03c6 and the GB coupling f (\u03c6) \u221d e\u03bc\u03ba\u03c6 . More recently Koivisto and Mota [26] showed that the GB coupling\nallows a possibility to lead to the exit from the scaling matter era to the dark energy dominated universe for the same\nmodel. See Refs. [27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36] for other aspects of the GB dark energy scenario.\nIn this paper we shall clarify the form of the GB coupling f (\u03c6) for the existence of scaling solutions by starting from\na very general scalar-field Lagrangian density p(\u03c6, X) where X is a kinematic term of the field. This includes a wide\nvariety of scalar-field models such as quintessence, K-essence, tachyon, and ghost condensate. The demand for scaling\nsolutions not only determines the field Lagrangian to be p(\u03c6, X) = Xg(Xe\u03bb\u03c6 ) (g is an arbitrary function) but also\nfixes the GB coupling in the form f (\u03c6) \u221d e\u03bb\u03c6 (here we use the unit \u03ba2 = 1). Thus our results are useful to construct\nviable dark energy models which possess scaling solutions in the matter-dominated epoch. We then investigate the\nfixed points for the scaling Lagrangian p(\u03c6, X) = Xg(Xe\u03bb\u03c6) with a GB coupling f (\u03c6) \u221d e\u03bc\u03c6 . We show the existence\nof a pure de-Sitter fixed point which exists only for specific models and study a possibility to obtain a scaling matter\nera that finally approaches the de-Sitter solution. A standard field with an exponential potential is a specific model\nto realize such a cosmological evolution provided that \u03bc > \u03bb. A tachyon field also possesses the de-Sitter fixed point,\nbut it does not have a scaling matter epoch. However the scaling matter era followed by the de-Sitter solution is\npossible if dark energy couples to dark matter. We shall discuss cosmological dynamics in such cases in details.\nII.\n\nTHE CONDITION FOR THE EXISTENCE OF SCALING SOLUTIONS IN GAUSS-BONNET\nCOSMOLOGY\n\nThe model we study is given by the following action\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n1\n4 \u221a\n2\nS = d x \u2212gM\nR + p(X, \u03c6) \u2212 f (\u03c6)RGB + Sm [\u03c6, \u03c8i , g\u03bc\u03bd ],\n2\u03ba2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere gM is a metric determinant, R is a Ricci scalar, p(\u03c6, X) is a Lagrangian density in terms of a scalar field \u03c6 and\n2\na kinematic energy X = \u2212(1/2)g \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2202\u03bd \u03c6. The Gauss-Bonnet (GB) term, RGB\n\u2261 R2 \u2212 4R\u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd + R\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd R\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd ,\ncouples to the field \u03c6 through the coupling f (\u03c6). We allow for an arbitrary coupling between the matter fields \u03c8i and\nthe scalar field \u03c6. We assume that the field \u03c6 is coupled to a barotropic perfect fluid (energy density \u03c1m and pressure\ndensity pm ) with a coupling given by [37, 38, 39]\nQ=\u2212\n\n\u03b4Sm\n1\n\u221a\n.\n\u03c1m \u2212gM \u03b4\u03c6\n\n(2)\n\nNote that the energy density of the scalar field is given by \u03c1 = 2X(\u2202p/\u2202X) \u2212 p with an equation of state w\u03c6 = p/\u03c1.\nIn what follows we shall use the unit \u03ba2 = 8\u03c0G = 1.\nIn the flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background with a scale factor a, the equations for \u03c1 and \u03c1m are\n\u03c1\u0307 + 3H(1 + w\u03c6 )\u03c1 = \u2212Q\u03c1m \u03c6\u0307 \u2212 24f \u2032 (\u03c6)\u03c6\u0307H 2 (H 2 + \u1e22) ,\n\u03c1\u0307m + 3H(1 + wm )\u03c1m = +Q\u03c1m \u03c6\u0307 ,\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\n\f3\nwhere H \u2261 \u0227/a is a Hubble parameter. A dot and a prime represent derivatives in terms of cosmic time t and the\nfield \u03c6, respectively. The Hubble parameter satisfies the constraint equation:\n3H 2 = \u03c1m + \u03c1 + 24f \u2032 (\u03c6)\u03c6\u0307H 3 .\n\n(5)\n\nThen the energy density of the GB term is given by \u03c1GB = 24f \u2032 (\u03c6)\u03c6\u0307H 3 . We define the fractional densities of the field\n\u03c6, the GB term, and the matter fluid, respectively, as\n\u03a9\u03c6 \u2261\n\n\u03c1\n,\n3H 2\n\n\u03a9GB \u2261 8f \u2032 (\u03c6)\u03c6\u0307H ,\n\n\u03a9m \u2261\n\n\u03c1m\n= 1 \u2212 \u03a9\u03c6 \u2212 \u03a9GB .\n3H 2\n\n(6)\n\nScaling solutions are characterised by constant values of \u03a9\u03c6 , \u03a9GB and \u03a9m , or equivalently a constant ratio between\neach energy density. Then this gives the condition:\nd ln \u03c1\nd ln \u03c1m\nd ln \u03c1GB\n=\n=\n\u2261 \u22123(1 + weff ) ,\ndN\ndN\ndN\n\n(7)\n\nwhere weff is an effective equation of state related to the Hubble rate via the relation\n\u1e22\n3\n= \u2212 (1 + weff ) .\nH2\n2\n\n(8)\n\nWe also note that w\u03c6 and wm are assumed to be constants in the scaling regime. From Eqs.

Following the\nprocedure in Ref. [16], Eq. (15) restricts the form of the Lagrangian density to be\n\"\n!#\nZ\n\u03c6\n\np = XQ2 (\u03c6)g XQ2 (\u03c6) exp\n\n\u03bb(\u03c6)d\u03c6\n\n,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere g is an arbitrary function. If Q is a constant, this reduces to a simple form:\np = Xg(Y ) ,\n\nY \u2261 Xe\u03bb\u03c6 ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere p is redefined so that a constant factor is removed from Eq. (17). This form of the scaling Lagrangian was first\nderived in Ref. [10] in the absence of the GB coupling (see also Ref. [14] for the extension of the analysis to the case\nH 2 \u221d \u03c1n ). Even if the GB term is present, we have shown that the Lagrangian takes the same form with a modified\nvalue of \u03bb given in Eq. (16). For a later convenience we present several models which belong to the scaling Lagrangian\n(18).\n\u2022 (i) An ordinary field with an exponential potential, i.e., p = X \u2212 ce\u2212\u03bb\u03c6 [12]. This corresponds to the choice\ng(Y ) = 1 \u2212 c/Y .\n\n(19)\n\n\u2022 (ii) A dilatonic ghost condensate model, i.e., p = \u2212X + ce\u03bb\u03c6 X 2 [10]. This corresponds to the choice\ng(Y ) = \u22121 + cY .\n\n(20)\n\np\n\u2022 (iii) A tachyon field, i.e., p = \u2212V (\u03c6) 1 \u2212 \u03c6\u03072 with V (\u03c6) \u221d \u03c6\u22122 [40, 41, 42]. This corresponds to the choice\n\u221a\n(21)\ng(Y ) = \u2212(c/Y ) 1 \u2212 2Y .\nNote that the field \u03c6 is related to \u03c6 via the relation \u03c6 = (2/\u03bb)e\u03bb\u03c6 /2.\nFrom Eq. (11) we find \u03c6\u0307/H = C/Q. Since the GB energy density, \u03c1GB = 24f \u2032 (\u03c6)\u03c6\u0307H 3 , satisfies the relation\nd ln \u03c1GB /dN = \u22123(1 + weff ) for scaling solutions, one gets\nf \u2032\u2032 (\u03c6) \u03c6\u0307\n= 3(1 + weff ) .\nf \u2032 (\u03c6) H\n\n(22)\n\nThis yields f \u2032\u2032 (\u03c6)/f \u2032 (\u03c6) = 3(1 + weff )Q/C = \u03bb, which gives\nf \u2032 (\u03c6) = \u03b1e\u03bb\u03c6 ,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is an integration constant. This means that the GB coupling is restricted to be in the form f (\u03c6) \u221d e\u03bb\u03c6 for\nthe existence of scaling solutions.\nIn the case of a non-relativistic dark matter (wm = 0), the quantity C is given by\nC=\n\n1 \u2212 \u03a9\u03c6 \u2212 \u03a9m \u2212 6w\u03c6 \u03a9\u03c6\n,\n1 + \u03a9\u03c6 + \u03a9m\n\n(24)\n\nwhereas the effective equation of state is\nweff = \u2212\n\n1 \u2212 \u03a9\u03c6 \u2212 \u03a9m \u2212 6w\u03c6 \u03a9\u03c6\n.\n3(1 + \u03a9\u03c6 + \u03a9m )\n\n(25)\n\nHence one has a simple relation weff = \u2212C/3. From Eq. (16) we get C = 3Q/(Q + \u03bb). Then from Eq. (11) we find\nthe following relation along the scaling solution:\n3\n\u03c6\u0307\n=\n.\nH\nQ+\u03bb\nThis is the same relation as in the case where the GB term is absent [10, 14].\n\n(26)\n\n\f5\nIII.\n\nAUTONOMOUS EQUATIONS AND FIXED POINTS\n\nIn this section we shall obtain fixed points for the scaling Lagrangian (18). We take into account the contribution\nof both non-relativistic dark matter (wm = 0) and radiation (wr = 1/3), in which case the Friedmann equation is\n3H 2 = \u03c1m + \u03c1r + \u03c1 + 24f \u2032(\u03c6)\u03c6\u0307H 3 .\n\n(27)\n\nHere the energy density of the scalar field is given by \u03c1 = X(g + g1 ), where gn \u2261 Y n g (n) (Y ) with g (n) (Y ) being the\nn-th derivative in terms of Y . We assume that the field \u03c6 is coupled to dark matter with a coupling Q and that it\nis uncoupled to radiation, as it is the case in the context of scalar-tensor theories [38]. Hence the equations for the\nenergy densities of dark matter and radiation are\n\u03c1\u0307m + 3H\u03c1m = +Q\u03c1m \u03c6\u0307 ,\n\u03c1\u0307r + 4H\u03c1r = 0 .\n\n(28)\n(29)\n\nThe scalar-field equation (3) can be written as\n\u03c6\u0308 + 3AH(g + g1 )\u03c6\u0307 + \u03bbX [1 \u2212 A(g + 2g1 )] + 24f \u2032 (\u03c6)AH 2 (H 2 + \u1e22) + AQ\u03c1m = 0 ,\n\n(30)\n\nwhere A is defined by\nA \u2261 (g + 5g1 + 2g2 )\u22121 .\n\n(31)\n\nWe shall define the following dimensionless quantities:\n\u03c6\u0307\n,\nx1 \u2261 \u221a\n6H\n\ne\u2212\u03bb\u03c6/2\nx2 \u2261 \u221a\n,\n3H\n\nx3 \u2261 f \u2032 (\u03c6)H 2 ,\n\n\u221a\n\u03c1r\nx4 \u2261 \u221a\n.\n3H\n\n(32)\n\nThen the energy fractions are\n\u03a9\u03c6 = x21 (g + 2g1 ) ,\n\n\u221a\n\u03a9GB = 8 6x1 x3 ,\n\n\u03a9r = x24 ,\n\n\u03a9m = 1 \u2212 \u03a9\u03c6 \u2212 \u03a9GB \u2212 \u03a9r .\n\n(33)\n\nThe variable Y defined in Eq. (18) can be expressed as\nY = x21 /x22 .\n\n(34)\n\nThe GB coupling f \u2032 (\u03c6) takes the form (23) for the existence of scaling solutions. We shall derive autonomous equations\nfor a more general case:\nf \u2032 (\u03c6) = \u03b1e\u03bc\u03c6 .\n\n(35)\n\nSince \u03bc = \u03bb for scaling solutions, one has the relation\nx22 x3 = \u03b1/3 .\n\n(36)\n\nIn this case the variable x3 is not needed to study a dynamical system.\nTaking the time-derivative of Eq. (27) with the use of Eqs. (28) and (29), we obtain\nh\ni\n4\n2\u1e22 = \u22122X(g + g1 ) \u2212 \u03c1m \u2212 \u03c1r + 8 f \u2032\u2032 (\u03c6)\u03c6\u03072 H 2 + f \u2032 (\u03c6)H(\u03c6\u0308H + 2\u03c6\u0307\u1e22 \u2212 \u03c6\u0307H 2 ) .\n3\n\n(37)\n\nEliminating the \u03c6\u0308 term from Eqs.

(38).\nIn what follows we will obtain fixed points in the absence of radiation (x4 = 0). Let us consider the cases: (i) \u03bb = \u03bc\nand (ii) \u03bb 6= \u03bc separately. We shall study the case \u03bb > 0 without loss of generality.\nA.\n\nCase of \u03bb = \u03bc\n\nAs we showed in the previous section, there exist scaling solutions for \u03bb = \u03bc. Taking note of the relation (36),\nneither x2 nor x3 is identical to zero if \u03b1 6= 0. When \u03b1 is negligibly small, x2 and x3 can be very small as well. In\nthis case we may regard x2 \u2248 0 or x3 \u2248 0 as approximate fixed points in Eqs. (40) and (41). Here we do not consider\nsuch fixed points, but in the next subsection we will discuss those cases when \u03bb does not equal to \u03bc.\nThen from Eqs. (40) and (41), the critical points corresponding to x2 6= 0 and x3 6= 0 satisfy\n\u221a\n\u1e22\n6\n=\u2212\n\u03bbx1 .\n(43)\n2\nH\n2\nThen substituting Eq. (43) for Eq.

(44) and (45) and eliminating the w\u03c6 \u03a9\u03c6 term, we obtain\nh\n\u221a i\n2(Q + \u03bb)x1 \u2212 6 (1 \u2212 \u03a9\u03c6 \u2212 \u03a9GB ) = 0 .\n\n(46)\n\n(47)\n\nThis gives the following fixed points:\n\u2022 (a) Scaling solution: x1 =\n\n\u221a\n6\n2(Q+\u03bb)\n\n,\n\n\u2022 (b) Scalar-field & GB dominated point: \u03a9\u03c6 + \u03a9GB = 1 .\nSince both points satisfy the relation (43), the effective equation of state is\n\u221a\n6\n\u03bbx1 .\nweff = \u22121 +\n3\nIn what follows we shall discuss two fixed points separately.\n\n(48)\n\n\f7\n1.\n\nFirst we recall that Eq.

The accelerated expansion occurs for weff < \u22121/3, i.e., Q > \u03bb/2 or\nQ < \u2212\u03bb.\nFrom Eq.

[12, 39].\nThe above scaling solution is attractive to be used in a matter era to alleviate the coincident problem, but it does\nnot give way to a late-time acceleration since the scaling solution is a global attractor [15, 16, 37]. If \u03bc > \u03bb, however,\nthe presence of the GB term can lead to the exit from the scaling matter era, as we will discuss later.\n\n\f8\n2.\n\nScalar-field & GB dominated point\n\nSince \u03a9\u03c6 + \u03a9GB = 1 in this case, this gives\n\u221a\nx21 (g + 2g1 ) + 8 6x1 x3 = 1 .\n\n(58)\n\nMaking use of Eq.

(58) one obtains the following equation for x1 :\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n3(\u03bb \u2212 6x1 )( 6\u03bbx31 \u2212 10x21 + 6\u03bbx1 \u2212 2) + 4c\u03b1(2 + 6\u03bbx1 )2 = 0 .\n(61)\n\u221a\n\u221a\nWhen \u03b1 = 0 this has a solution x1 = \u03bb/ 6, which can lead to an accelerated expansion for \u03bb < 2. Let us obtain\n\u221a the\nsolution for (61) perturbatively under the assumption that \u03b1 is much smaller than unity. Substituting x1 = \u03bb/ 6 + \u01eb\nfor Eq. (61), we find the following approximate relation\ns \u0012\n\u221a\n\u0013\n1\n4 6c\u03b1(\u03bb2 + 2)\n\u03bb\n\u03bb2\n2c\u03b1\n\u221a\n\u2212\nx1 =\n1\u2212\n, x3 =\n,\n(62)\n, x2 =\n3(6 \u2212 \u03bb2 )\nc\n6\n6 \u2212 \u03bb2\n6\nand\n\u03a9GB =\n\n16c\u03b1\u03bb\n,\n6 \u2212 \u03bb2\n\n\u03a9\u03c6 = 1 \u2212 \u03a9GB .\n\n(63)\n\nNote that the effective equation of state is given by\nweff = \u22121 +\n\n8c\u03b1\u03bb(\u03bb2 + 2)\n\u03bb2\n\u03bb2 + 2\n\u03bb2\n\u2212\n= \u22121 +\n\u2212\n\u03a9GB .\n2\n3\n3(6 \u2212 \u03bb )\n3\n6\n\n(64)\n\nThus the contribution of the GB term tends to reduce weff . In the absence of the GB coupling the late-time acceleration\noccurs for \u03bb2 < 2. In this case the scaling matter era is not present, since the existence of it requires the condition\n\u03bb2 > 3 [12]. Hence this case is not attractive to solve the coincident problem, although the standard matter-dominated\nepoch is followed by an accelerated expansion due to a shallow potential as in the case of a cosmological constant.\nWhen the GB term is present, there is a contribution of its energy density to the late-time acceleration. However,\nas we will see in a later section, the contribution of the GB term is restricted to be small from the constraint that it\ndoes not disturb the cosmological evolution during radiation and matter eras.\nB.\n\nCase of \u03bb 6= \u03bc: Exit from the scaling regime\n\nStrictly speaking, scaling solutions are present only for \u03bb = \u03bc in the presence of the GB coupling. Even when\n\u03bb 6= \u03bc, however, they can exist approximately as long as the contribution of the GB term is negligibly small. This\ncorresponds to a situation in which x3 is very much smaller than 1. Note that x3 can not be exactly zero since the\nrelation between x2 and x3 is\nx22 x3 =\n\n\u03b1 (\u03bc\u2212\u03bb)\u03c6\ne\n.\n3\n\n(65)\n\nStill one can regard x3 \u2248 0 as an approximate fixed point satisfying this relation. Then we approximately obtain\nthe following 4 fixed points (A), (B), (C) and (D) using the results of Refs. [15, 16] recently obtained for x3 = 0.\nHereafter, when we write x2 = 0 or x3 = 0, it means that they are not exactly zero but are very small values.\n\n\f9\nx3 = 0 and\n\n1.\n\n\u221a\n\n6\u03bbx1 /2 = \u2212\u1e22/H 2\n\n\u2022 (A) Scaling solutions.\n\nThey are characterized by\n\u221a\n6\n,\nx1 =\n2(Q + \u03bb)\n\nweff = \u2212\n\nQ\n,\nQ+\u03bb\n\n\u03a9\u03c6 =\n\nQ(Q + \u03bb) + 3p,X\n,\n(Q + \u03bb)2\n\n2\ng(Y ) = \u2212 Q(Q + \u03bb) ,\n3\n\n(66)\n\nwhere p,X \u2261 \u2202p/\u2202X. Note that x1 and weff are the same as in the case where the GB term is present. This\nsolution is stable when the following conditions are satisfied [16]:\n\u2212\n\nQ\n\u2264 \u03a9\u03c6 < 1 ,\nQ+\u03bb\n\nA > 0,\n\n(67)\n\nwhere A is defined in Eq. (31). The latter condition automatically holds when we impose the stability of quantum\nfluctuations of the scalar field [10]. When Q = 0 the scaling solution is stable for 0 \u2264 \u03a9\u03c6 < 1, as required for\nthe existence of itself.\n\u2022 (B) Scalar-field dominated solutions.\nThey are characterized by\n\n\u03a9\u03c6 = 1 ,\n\nweff = w\u03c6 = \u22121 +\n\nWhen Q is positive, this solution is stable for x1 <\n\n2.\n\n\u221a\n\n6\u03bb\nx1 .\n3\n\n(68)\n\n\u221a\n6/[2(Q + \u03bb)].\n\nx3 = 0 and x2 = 0\n\nThe solutions which satisfy x3 = 0 and x2 = 0 correspond to kinematic fixed points. These exist only when\ng(Y = x21 /x22 ) is non-singular, namely, when g is expanded as\nX\ng = c0 \u2212\ncn Y \u2212n ,\n(69)\nn>0\n\nwhere c0 and cn are constants. Since gn (x2 \u2192 0) = 0 in this case, one can easily get the following points from\nEq.

These are saddle or unstable nodes if Q > 0. Since \u03a9\u03c6 = weff = 1, one\ncan use pure kinetic solutions neither for matter/radiation eras nor for dark energy eras.\nFrom Eq.

When Q = 0 and\nc0 = 0 these solutions satisfy\n\u221a\n\u221a 2\n\u221a\n\u221a\n6x1 (2 \u2212 \u03bcx1 )\n3\n2\n2 4\n\u221a ,\n(72)\nF (x1 ) \u2261 6\u03bc x1 \u2212 (24 + 6)\u03bcx1 + [6(\u03bc + 5)4 6]x1 \u2212 5 6\u03bcx1 + 6 = 0 , x3 =\n8(3\u03bcx1 \u2212 6)\ntogether with an effective equation of state:\nweff\n\n\u221a\n6\n= \u22121 +\n\u03bcx1 .\n3\n\n(73)\n\n\u221a\nWe have weff = \u22121/3 for x1 = 6/(3\u03bc). Equation (72) possesses two real solutions. If \u03bc = 10, for example,\nwe get (x1 , x3 , weff ) = (0.08235, 1.40993, \u22120.3276), (0.12454, 0.02236, 0.01689). In both cases we do not have an\naccelerated expansion (weff < \u22121/3).\n\u221a When \u03bc > 0 we find that the values of x1 corresponding to two real\nsolutions of Eq. (72) are larger than 6/(3\u03bc), which means weff > \u22121/3 from Eq. (73). Hence one can not use\nthese solutions for dark energy.\nThese fixed points correspond to the absence of the field potential, in which case the accelerated solution has\nnot been found in Ref. [27]. This is consistent with the above result.\n\n4.\n\n\u221a\n\n6\u03bcx1 /2 = \u2212\u1e22/H 2 and\n\n\u221a\n\n6\u03bbx1 /2 = \u2212\u1e22/H 2\n\n\u2022 (F) de-Sitter point.\nWhen \u03bb 6= \u03bc there exists a fixed point x1 = 0 from Eqs. (40) and (41). Since \u1e22/H 2 = 0 in this case, this corresponds\nto a de-Sitter solution. In fact one has weff = \u22121 from Eq. (48). Equation (38) gives\nh \u221a\ni\n1\n\u2212 (3 + 3gx21 ) + 12Ax3 \u2212 6(g + g1 )x1 + (Q + \u03bb)(g + 2g1 )x21 \u2212 8x3 \u2212 Q = 0 .\n2\n\n(74)\n\ni\nh \u221a\nA \u2212 6(g + g1 )x1 + (Q + \u03bb)(g + 2g1 )x21 \u2212 8x3 \u2212 Q = 0 .\n\n(75)\n\nMeanwhile Eq. (39) leads to\n\nThen we find that the fixed point satisfies\n\ngx21 = \u22121 ,\n\nx1 = 0 .\n\n(76)\n\nOnce the form of g(Y ) is specified, one can get x2 by solving this equation. From Eq. (75) we get\nx3 =\n\ni\n\u221a\n1h\n(Q + \u03bb)(g + 2g1 )x21 \u2212 Q \u2212 6(g + g1 )x1 .\n8\n\n(77)\n\nLet us consider a standard scalar field with an exponential potential, i.e., the model given by (19). Then the above\nde-Sitter solution corresponds to\n\u221a\n(x1 , x2 , x3 ) = (0, 1/ c, \u03bb/8) .\n(78)\nMore generally Eq. (76) can be satisfied when g = g(Y ) is written in the form\ng(Y ) = [c0 \u2212 (c/Y )] f (Y ) ,\n\n(79)\n\nwhere f (Y ) is a function which approaches a constant d as x1 \u2192 0. In this case we obtain the following fixed point:\n\u221a\n(x1 , x2 , x3 ) = (0, 1/ cd, \u03bb/8) .\n(80)\nThe model (79) includes a tachyon field with a Lagrangian given in Eq. (21).\n\n\f11\nIn order for the existence of the de-Sitter solution, it is crucial to have the term c/Y in the expression of g(Y ). For\nexample, when g(Y ) is written as a sum of positive powers of Y n such as a dilatonic ghost condensate model given in\nEq. (20), we do not have such a de-Sitter solution.\nFrom Eqs. (33) and (80) we find that this fixed point satisfies\n\u03a9\u03c6 = 1 ,\n\n\u03a9GB = 0 .\n\n(81)\n\nSince the field is frozen at the de-Sitter point, the GB term does not have any contribution to the energy density of\nthe universe.\nThe appearance of the de-Sitter point comes from the presence of the GB term. For example when g(Y ) = 1 \u2212 c/Y ,\nEq. (30) reduces to\n\u03c6\u0308 + 3H \u03c6\u0307 \u2212 c\u03bbe\u2212\u03bb\u03c6 + 24f \u2032 (\u03c6)(H 2 + \u1e22) = 0 ,\n\n(82)\n\nwhere we dropped the coupling Q. Since f \u2032 (\u03c6)Hc2 = \u03bb/8 and \u1e22c = 0 at the critical point, the effective potential\nVeff (\u03c6) for the field \u03c6 satisfies the relation\ndVeff\n= \u2212c\u03bbe\u2212\u03bb\u03c6 + 3\u03bbHc2 .\nd\u03c6\n\n(83)\n\nThe last term appears because of the presence of the GB term, which gives rise to a potential minimum for the field\n\u03c6. Then after the field drops down at this minimum, the universe exhibits a de-Sitter expansion.\nLet us consider the stability of the de-Sitter solution. By perturbating Eqs. (39), (40) and (41) about the fixed\npoint, we obtain a 3 \u00d7 3 Jacobian matrix M for perturbations \u03b4x1 , \u03b4x2 and \u03b4x3 [3] (we neglect the contribution of\nradiation). For the model (19) the eigenvalues of the matrix M are\ns\n\"\n#\n3\n8\u03bb(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bc)\n\u03bb1 = \u22123, \u03bb2,3 =\n\u22121 \u00b1 1 +\n.\n(84)\n2\n3(2 + 3\u03bb2 )\nThis explicitly shows the following property for the stability of the de-Sitter point:\n\u2022 (i) Stable for \u03bc > \u03bb.\n\u2022 (ii) Saddle for \u03bc < \u03bb.\nWhen \u03bc = \u03bb one has \u03bb1 = \u22123, \u03bb2 = 0 and \u03bb3 = \u22123, which means that the de-Sitter solution is marginally stable.\nThe same eigenvalues as given in Eq. (84) can be obtained by demanding the conditions \u03a9\u03c6 = 1, (g + g1 )x1 = 0\nand A = 1 at the fixed point without specifying the form of g(Y ). This includes the tachyon model (21) with a choice\nc = 1. Provided that \u03bc > \u03bb the system falls down to the stable de-Sitter point.\nIV.\n\nCOSMOLOGICAL DYNAMICS\n\nIn this section we shall study cosmological dynamics for the scaling Lagrangian (18) with the GB coupling given\nin Eq. (35). Our interest is to find a case in which a late-time accelerated expansion is realized by the presence of\nthe GB term. Such a possibility can be accommodated by using the de-Sitter fixed point discussed in the previous\nsection. We would also like to make use of scaling solutions during the matter-dominated era in order to alleviate the\ncoincident problem.\nWhen \u03bb = \u03bc there exists a scaling matter era with 0 < \u03a9\u03c6 , \u03a9GB < 1, but the system does not get away from the\nscaling regime to give rise to a late-time acceleration. We require that \u03bc does not equal to \u03bb in order to exit from the\nscaling\n\u221a matter era. Let us consider the approximate scaling solution (66) which exists under the conditions x3 \u2248 0\nand 6\u03bbx1 /2 = \u2212\u1e22/H 2 . Perturbing Eq. (41) about the fixed point, we obtain\nd\n3(\u03bc \u2212 \u03bb)\n\u03b4x3 =\n\u03b4x3 .\ndN\nQ+\u03bb\n\n(85)\n\nTo get weff \u2243 0 during the matter era, we require Q \u226a \u03bb from Eq. (66). Since we are now considering positive \u03bb,\nthe system departs from x3 = 0 for \u03bc > \u03bb whereas it approaches x3 = 0 for \u03bc < \u03bb. As we mentioned in the previous\nsection, the stability of the perturbations \u03b4x1 and \u03b4x2 is ensured when the condition \u2212Q/(Q + \u03bb) \u2264 \u03a9\u03c6 < 1 is\nsatisfied, i.e., \u03bb(\u03bb + Q) > 3p,X \u2265 \u22122Q(\u03bb + Q). For a non-phantom field (p,X > 0) with Q = 0, this condition reduces\nto \u03bb2 > 3p,X . From the above discussion we find the following property for the stability of the scaling solution:\n\n\f12\n1.2\n\nWr\n\nWm\n\n0.80\n\nWf\n\n0.40\n\nWGB\n\n0.0\n\n-0.40\n\n-0.80\n\nweff\n\n-1.2\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nN\nFIG. 1: Evolution of the variables \u03a9\u03c6 , \u03a9GB , \u03a9m and \u03a9r together with the effective equation of state weff for \u03bb = 4, \u03bc = 12,\n\u03b1 = 10\u221222 , Q = 0 and c = 10\u22122 in the case of an ordinary field with an exponential potential. We choose initial conditions\nx1 = 10\u22128 , x2 = 10\u22127 , x3 = 3.6 \u00d7 10\u22129 and x4 = 0.999. The solution is in a scaling regime during the matter-dominated epoch\nand finally approaches the de-Sitter universe characterized by \u03a9\u03c6 = 1, \u03a9GB = 0 and weff = \u22121. The energy fraction of the field\n\u03c6 during the scaling regime is \u03a9\u03c6 = 3/\u03bb2 = 0.1875.\n\n\u2022 (i) Saddle for \u03bc > \u03bb and \u03bb(\u03bb + Q) > 3p,X \u2265 \u22122Q(\u03bb + Q).\n\u2022 (ii) Stable for \u03bc < \u03bb and \u03bb(\u03bb + Q) > 3p,X \u2265 \u22122Q(\u03bb + Q).\nThen in the case (i) the solutions can exit from the scaling regime to connect to the dark energy era.\nAs we showed in the previous section, the de-Sitter point (F) is stable for \u03bc > \u03bb, whereas it is a saddle point for\n\u03bc < \u03bb. Then it is clear that the scaling solution can be connected to the de-Sitter solution provided \u03bc > \u03bb and\n\u03bb(\u03bb + Q) > 3p,X \u2265 \u22122Q(\u03bb + Q). The de-Sitter solution is present only for a restricted class of models. In what\nfollows we shall investigate cosmological evolution for such two models: (i) an ordinary field and (ii) a tachyon field.\nA.\n\nAn ordinary field with an exponential potential\n\nWe shall first study the case of an ordinary field with an exponential potential (p = X \u2212 ce\u2212\u03bb\u03c6 ). Since p,X = 1 in\nthis case, one can have a scaling solution in the matter era if \u03bb2 > 3 in the absence of the coupling Q. In Fig. 1 we\nplot the evolution of \u03a9\u03c6 , \u03a9GB , \u03a9m and \u03a9r together with weff for \u03bb = 4, \u03bc = 12, \u03b1 = 10\u221222 and Q = 0. The system\nstarts from a radiation-dominated epoch, which is followed by the scaling regime in the matter-dominated era. Since\n\u03bc > \u03bb the solution exits from the scaling regime and finally approaches the stable de-Sitter fixed point. The final\nattractor solution actually satisfies \u03a9\u03c6 = 1 and \u03a9GB = 0, as estimated analytically.\nFigure 1 shows that the energy fraction of the GB term grows right after end of the matter era, which begins to\ndecrease after the increase of \u03a9\u03c6 . In Fig. 1 the effective equation of state temporally takes a local minimum value\nweff \u2248 \u22120.6 around \u03a9m \u2248 0.3-0.4, which means that the accelerated expansion indeed occurs at the present epoch in\nthis scenario. Note that the rapid transition of weff just after the matter-dominated era is associated with the growth\nof \u03a9GB . As \u03bc is increased, weff tends to get smaller. When \u03bb = 4, for example, we find that the phantom equation of\nstate, weff < \u22121, is realized for \u03bc > 25. Meanwhile the increase of \u03bc leads to a shorter period of the matter-dominated\nepoch. Hence the transient phantom stage is realized at the expense of such a short matter period. If we take larger\n\u03bb, it is also difficult to get smaller values of weff satisfying the condition for an accelerated expansion compatible with\nobservations. Thus \u03bb is bounded from above as well.\nIn Refs. [26, 43] Koivisto and Mota placed observational constraints using the Gold data set of Supernova Ia [44]\n<\ntogether with the CMB shift parameter data [45].

We choose initial\nconditions x1 = 10\u221213 , x2 = 10\u221213 , x3 = 3.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 and x4 = 0.999. After a standard matter era without a scaling regime,\nthe system falls down to a de-Sitter fixed point before it reaches a scalar-field dominated point. The effective equation of state\ntemporally drops down toward the phantom region (weff < \u22121).\n\nconfidence level, see Fig. 3 in Ref. [26]1 . If the solutions are in the scaling regime in radiation era the constraint\ncoming from Nucleosynthesis gives \u03bb > 4.47 [3, 17], in which case the allowed range of \u03bb is severely constrained.\nWhen \u03bb = \u03bc we have shown that there exists a scalar-field & GB dominated point with \u03a9\u03c6 + \u03a9GB = 1. This\nsolution can be also used for a late-time acceleration. Note that in the absence of the GB term the existence of the\nstable scalar-field dominated solution demands the condition \u03bb2 < 3 [12], in which case the scaling solution with\n\u03a9\u03c6 < 1 does not exist in the matter-dominated epoch. To get a stable scalar-field dominated solution, one has to use\nthe \u03c6MDE solution (70) in the preceding matter period (the standard matter era corresponds to Q = 0). In this case\nx2 and x3 need to be very small during a radiation era to have \u03a9\u03c6 \u226a 1 and \u03a9GB \u226a 1, which restricts the coupling\n\u03b1 very small through the relation x22 x3 = \u03b1/3. Then, at the scalar-field & GB dominated point, \u03a9GB in Eq. (63) is\nnegligibly small relative to \u03a9\u03c6 , in which case the effect of the GB term is not important around the present epoch.\nThus, for small \u03bb, the \u03c6MDE is followed by the scalar-field & GB dominated point, but the impact of the GB term\nfor the late-time acceleration is not significant for \u03bb = \u03bc.\nThen what happens for \u03bc > \u03bb ? In this case the GB term finally comes out to lead to the de-Sitter expansion\nby giving rise to a minimum of an effective potential. If \u03bc is not much different from \u03bb, this occurs at sufficiently\nlate-times after the solutions approach the scalar-field dominated point. On the other hand, if \u03bc \u226b \u03bb, the system\ncan be trapped at the de-Sitter point before it reaches the scalar-field dominated solution. In Fig. 2 we plot the\ncosmological evolution for \u03bb = 1, \u03bc = 100, \u03b1 = \u221a\n10\u221229 and Q = 0. In this case the scaling solution does not exist in\nthe matter era because of the smallness of \u03bb (< 3). We find that the GB term becomes important around \u03a9\u03c6 = 0.7,\nwhich leads to the rapid decrease of weff toward the phantom region. The effective equation of state approaches \u22121\nafter the field settles down at the potential minimum. The effect of the GB term can be seen at present time in such\na case, but the absence of the scaling matter era is not attractive to alleviate the coincidence problem.\nB.\n\nA tachyon field with an inverse square potential\n\nAs we have already mentioned, the tachyon field also possesses the de-Sitter fixed point. Meanwhile, when Q = 0,\nthe scaling solution does not exist if the background fluid corresponds to a non-relativistic matter (wm = 0). In fact,\n\n1\n\nNote that the definition of \u03bb in Ref. [26] is different from ours by the factor\n\n\u221a\n\n2.\n\n\f14\nfor the function g(Y ) given in Eq. (21), Eq. (66) shows that the scaling solution satisfies\n\u0014\n\u0015\n3c\n1\n\u221a\nQ(Q + \u03bb) +\n,\n\u03a9\u03c6 =\n(Q + \u03bb)2\n1 \u2212 2Y\nc\u221a\n2\n1 \u2212 2Y = Q(Q + \u03bb) .\nY\n3\n\n(86)\n(87)\n\nWhen Q = 0 one gets Y =\u221a1/2 from Eq. (87), which then means that \u03a9\u03c6 diverges from Eq. (86). More generally we\nhave \u03a9\u03c6 = 3(1 + wm )/(\u03bb2 \u2212wm ) for the background fluid with an equation of state wm [41, 42], showing that the\nscaling solution exists only for wm < 0. Hence in the absence of the coupling Q one can not have a successful scaling\nepoch followed by a de-Sitter expansion.\nOn the other hand the scaling matter era can exist if the coupling Q is present. As we already\n\u221amentioned, we require\nQ \u226a \u03bb to recover the equation of state weff \u2248 0. In this case we get the approximate relation 1 \u2212 2Y \u2248 Q\u03bb/3c from\nEq. (87). Then from Eq. (86) we find that \u03a9\u03c6 is approximately given by\n\u03a9\u03c6 \u2248\n\n9c2 + (Q\u03bb)2\n.\nQ\u03bb3\n\n(88)\n\nFor example, when Q = 0.1, \u03bb = 10 and c = 1, one has \u03a9\u03c6 = 0.1 and weff = \u22120.0099. Note that the variable A\ndefined in Eq. (31) is given by A = (1 \u2212 2Y )3/2 /c, which is positive for c > 0 (corresponding to a positive potential).\nThen the scaling solution is stable provided that \u2212Q/(Q + \u03bb) \u2264 \u03a9\u03c6 < 1 and c > 0. It becomes a saddle point if the\nGB coupling is present with \u03bc larger than \u03bb. In this case the scaling matter era is followed by the de-Sitter solution.\nIn Fig. 3 we plot the cosmological evolution for Q = 0.1, \u03bb = 7, \u03bc = 20 and \u03b1 = 10\u221235 . We find that the solution\nfirst enters the scaling matter era during which \u03a9m and \u03a9\u03c6 are constants. This regime is followed by the growth of\nthe GB term, which leads to a rapid decrease of weff toward weff \u2248 \u22120.7 around the present time (\u03a9m = 0.3-0.4).\nNumerically we checked that the minimum value of weff temporarily reached after the scaling matter era gets smaller\nif we choose smaller \u03bb or larger \u03bc. Finally the solution falls down to the de-Sitter fixed point with \u03a9\u03c6 = 1, \u03a9GB = 0\nand weff = \u22121.\nFrom the above discussion we require that Q is bounded from below to get the scaling matter era and that it is\nbounded from above to obtain the effective equation of state which does not differ from weff = 0 much. It is certainly\nof interest to find the parameter spaces of Q and \u03bb to realize the sequence of the scaling matter era and the de-Sitter\nexpansion satisfying observational constraints, which we leave for future work.\nC.\n\nGhost conditions\n\nRecently a number of authors [31, 32] discussed ghost conditions in GB cosmologies. It is possible to see the\nsignature of ghosts by studying gravitational perturbations. We shall consider scalar and tensor perturbations about\nthe FRW background [46]:\nds2 = \u2212(1 + 2A)dt2 + 2a\u2202i Bdxi dt + a2 [(1 + 2\u03c8)\u03b4ij + 2\u2202ij E + 2hij ] dxi dxj ,\n\n(89)\n\nwhere \u2202i represents the spatial partial derivative \u2202/\u2202xi . Here A, B, \u03c8 and E are scalar quantities, whereas hij is a\ntensor quantity. We shall investigate whether or not ghosts appear for an ordinary scalar field with an exponential\npotential, i.e., p = X \u2212 ce\u2212\u03bb\u03c6 . In what follows we neglect the contribution of the matter fluid. Although the equation\nof scalar perturbations is modified in the presence of matter, the equation of tensor perturbations is unchanged.\nDefining the gauge-invariant comoving perturbation, R \u2261 \u03c8 \u2212 H\u03b4\u03c6/\u03c6\u0307, the Fourier modes of scalar perturbations\nsatisfy [47, 48]\n2\n1\n*\n2k\n3\n\u1e58)\n+\nc\n(a\nQ\nS\nS 2R = 0,\na3 Q S\na\n\nwhere k is a comoving wavenumber and\nh\ni\n(1 \u2212 8H f \u0307) (1 \u2212 8H f \u0307)\u03c6\u03072 + 96(H 2 f \u0307)2\n,\nQS =\n \u03072\nH 2 (1 \u2212 12H f)\nh\ni\n \u0307 (1 \u2212 8H f \u0307)\u03c6\u03072 + 96(H 2 f \u0307)2 + 128H 2 \u1e22 f \u03072 + 256(H 2 f \u0307)2 (f \u0308 \u2212 H f \u0307)\n(1 \u2212 8H f)\ni\nh\n.\nc2S =\n \u0307 \u03c6\u03072 + 96(H 2 f \u0307)2\n(1 \u2212 8H f \u0307) (1 \u2212 8H f)\n\n(90)\n\n(91)\n\n(92)\n\n\f15\n\n1.5\n\nWr\n\n1.0\n\nWf\n\nWm\n\n0.50\n\nWGB\n\n0.0\n\n-0.50\n\nweff\n\n-1.0\n\n-1.5\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nN\nFIG. 3: Evolution of the variables \u03a9\u03c6 , \u03a9GB , \u03a9m and \u03a9r together with the effective equation of state weff for Q = 0.1, \u03bb = 7,\n\u03bc = 20, \u03b1 = 10\u221235 and c = 1 in the case of a tachyon field with an inverse square potential.

The scaling matter era is present because of the presence of the\ncoupling Q.\n\nDecomposing tensor perturbations into eigenmodes of the spatial Lagrangian, \u22072 eij = \u2212k 2 eij , with scalar amplitude\nh(t), i.e., hij = h(t)eij , where eij have two polarization states, the Fourier modes of tensor perturbations obey the\nequation of motion [47, 48]\n1\na3 Q\n\nT\n\n(a3 QT \u1e23)* + c2T\n\nk2\nh = 0,\na2\n\n(93)\n\nwhere\nQT = 1 \u2212 8H f \u0307 ,\n\nc2T =\n\n1 \u2212 8f \u0308\n\n1 \u2212 8H f \u0307\n\n.\n\n(94)\n\nThe perturbations exhibit exponential instabilities if c2S and c2T are negative. The propagation speeds of scalar and\ntensor modes are superluminal if c2S and c2T are larger than unity. In Refs. [31, 32] it was shown that the no-ghost\nstate to ensure a consistent quantum field theory gives the constraints 1 \u2212 8H f \u0307 > 0 and 1 \u2212 8f \u0308 > 0.

During the scaling matter era in which x3 is much smaller than of order unity\n[see Eq. (56)], we have that |H f \u0307| \u226a 1 and |f \u0308| \u226a 1 giving c2S \u2243 1 and c2T \u2243 1. For the de-Sitter point (78) one can\neasily show that c2S = c2T = 1. These properties are in fact confirmed in the numerical simulation of Fig. 4.\nWe find from Fig. 4 that c2S and c2T temporally become negative during the transition from the scaling matter\nera to the final de-Sitter era. This corresponds to the stage in which the contribution of the GB term is dominant.\nThe perturbations exhibit exponential instabilities associated with the appearance of ghosts. The propagation speed\nof scalar perturbations can be modified in the presence of a matter fluid, but that of tensor perturbations is not\naffected. Hence the negative instability of tensor perturbations is robust even taking into account the contribution of\nthe matter. This is consistent with the results of Ref. [48] in which the negative instability of tensor perturbations\n\n\f16\n\n2.5\n\nx\nc S2\n\n2.0\n\nc T2\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.50\n\n0.0\n\n-0.50\n\n-1.0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nN\nFIG. 4: Evolution of the variables \u03be = 1 \u2212 8H f \u0307, c2S and c2T for an ordinary field with an exponential potential with the same\nmodel parameters and initial conditions as given in Fig. 1.

Moreover the propagation speed of the scalar mode becomes\nsuperluminal.\n\nhas been also found if inflationary solutions are constructed by the dominance of the GB term. In Fig. 4 we also find\nthat the propagation speed of scalar perturbations temporally become superluminal2 .\nFor the model parameters given in Figs. 1 and 4 the propagation speed cT becomes imaginary before the system\nreaches the present epoch (while c2S is positive). Meanwhile if we choose smaller values of \u03bc, it is possible to avoid\nreaching the negative values of c2T . For smaller \u03bc, however, the minimum value of weff tends to be larger. Hence the\nexponential instability of tensor perturbations can be avoided at the expense of losing rapid accelerated expansion\nof the universe. It is of interest to find parameter ranges of \u03bb and \u03bc which lead to positive c2T and also satisfy the\nobservational constraints of weff .\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have discussed the viability of Gauss-Bonnet (GB) dark energy models which possess cosmological\nscaling solutions. In order to alleviate the coincident problem of dark energy, it is of interest to find a cosmological\ntrajectory which is in a scaling regime (\u03a9\u03c6 /\u03a9m =constant) during a matter era and finally exits to give rise to a\nlate-time accelerated expansion. We have tried to understand the property of scalar-field dark energy models which\nallow such a possibility.\nFirst we derived the form of the GB coupling together with the form of the scalar-field Lagrangian for the existence\nof scaling solutions by starting from a very general action given in Eq. (1). The form of the GB coupling has been\nfound to be f (\u03c6) \u221d e\u03bb\u03c6 together with the field Lagrangian density p = Xg(Xe\u03bb\u03c6), where \u03bb is defined in Eq. (16) and\ng is an arbitrary function. The field Lagrangian density takes the same form as in the case where the GB coupling is\nabsent.\n\u03bb\u03c6\nWe have also derived autonomous equations and fixed points for the scaling Lagrangian p = Xg(Xe\n) with the\n\u221a\n\u03bc\u03c6\nGB coupling f (\u03c6) \u221d e . When \u03bb = \u03bc, we obtained the scaling solution characterised by x1 = 6/[2(Q + \u03bb)] and\n\n2\n\nIn the context of K-essence, Bonvin et al. [49] recently found that the propagation speed of scalar perturbations also temporally becomes\nsuperluminal in order to solve the coincident problem of dark energy.\n\n\f17\nthe scalar-field dominated solution characterised by \u03a9\u03c6 + \u03a9GB = 1 without specifying any form of the Lagrangian.\nIn this case, however, the solutions do not get away from the scaling matter regime to connect to a dark energy era.\nWhen \u03bc > \u03bb the presence of the GB term can lead to the exit from the scaling regime.\nThe GB term allows an interesting possibility to have a late-time de-Sitter fixed point. This point is present if the\nsolutions for gx21 = 0 and x1 = 0 exist. The models which possess this de-Sitter solution are characterised by the form\ng(Y ) = (c0 \u2212 c/Y )f (Y ), where f (Y ) is a function that approaches a constant as x1 \u2192 0. The ordinary field with an\nexponential potential (19) and the tachyon field with an inverse square potential (21) belong to this class, whereas\nthe dilatonic ghost condensate model (20) does not.\nWe have studied cosmological evolution for the above two models in which the de-Sitter point is present. In the\ncase of an ordinary field with an exponential potential one can in fact obtain a viable trajectory along which the\nscaling matter period is followed by the de-Sitter solution provided that \u03bc > \u03bb and \u03bb2 > 3 for Q = 0. There is also\nan interesting possibility in which the effective equation of state weff temporarily becomes smaller than \u22121 because of\nthe growth of the GB term. This is realized by choosing larger values of \u03bc, but it also corresponds to a shorter matterdominated period. The late-time acceleration is possible even for \u03bb = \u03bc by using a scalar-field & GB dominated point\n(\u03a9\u03c6 + \u03a9GB = 1), but in this case the contribution of the GB term is very small at the present epoch. Moreover we do\nnot have a scaling matter era in this case, which is not a welcome feature in solving the coincidence problem.\nThe tachyon field has a de-Sitter fixed point, but in this case the scaling solution is absent for a non-relativistic\nbackground fluid (wm = 0) if Q = 0. Hence we do not have a successful sequence of the scaling matter era and the\nde-Sitter expansion. If the coupling Q is present, however, it is possible to realize this sequence when \u03bc is larger than\n\u03bb. The values of Q are bounded from both above and below to get a scaling matter era with weff close to 0. An\nalternative approach to the problem discussed here can be provided by Renormalization Group (RG) equations. The\nscaling solution presented here turns out to be the fixed point of RG flow equations; the form of the field Lagrangian\nand the GB coupling are automatically fixed in this method [50].\nWe also discussed ghost conditions for the GB dark energy models by considering gravitational perturbations. For\nthe ordinary field with an exponential potential we found that the propagation speeds of scalar and tensor modes\ncan be imaginary during the transition from the scaling matter era to the final de-Sitter attractor. This is associated\nwith the appearance of ghosts which lead to negative instabilities of perturbations. This ghost stage can be avoided\nby tuning the model parameters at the expense of obtaining a minimum effective equation of state closer to \u22121.\nIn this paper we have not studied local gravity constraints on the GB coupling [51, 52]. If the contribution of the GB\ncoupling is large at present epoch, this may contradict with local gravity experiments unless an accidental cancellation\noccurs to avoid the large variation of effective gravitational constant. We leave future work for the construction of\nscaling GB dark energy models consistent with such constraints. We hope that the results obtained in this paper will\nbe useful to find such viable models.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe thank L. Amendola, S. Jhingan, S. Nojiri and S. D. Odintsov for useful discussions.
