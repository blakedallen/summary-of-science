Introduction\nDeveloping strategies for mitigating the severity of the influenza epidemics is a top\npublic health priority. As soon as vaccine became available, vaccination campaigns\nstarted in several countries as a primary mitigation strategy against the first wave of\nthe 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic. Mathematical models are powerful tools for evaluating intervention strategies and quantifying the potential benefits of different options\n(Moghadas et al. 2009). We use a compartmental system with five age groups representing the European population, that incorporates transmission dynamics based\non social contact profiles from survey data (Mossong et al. 2008) and vaccination\nstatus. Vaccination has not only direct benefit to the individual, but also reduces\nthe risk for those who have not been vaccinated.

Hungary has a similar maximal production capacity in the range of up to 5% of the population per week (Falus 2009), thus\nhere we targeted a 60% vaccine coverage by the end of a three months campaign.\nRecent studies revealed the importance of age specific intervention strategies, and\ndiscussed how to distribute vaccines among age groups, assuming preseasonal vaccination (Longini & Halloran 2005; Medlock & Galvani 2009). Here we focus on a\ncompletely different aspect: how to prioritize the different groups in the timing of\nthe schedule. Therefore for the purposes of this study, in the baseline scenario we\nassume that a 60% total coverage is reached within each age group by the end of\nthe vaccination campaign, and we compare different strategies for the order and\nthe timing of vaccinating different age groups during the campaign. Furthermore, a\nrange of different scenarios are considered in the sensitivity analysis. The relatively\nlow basic reproduction number of influenza (see Chowell et al. 2007 and Chowell\net al. 2006 for estimations of the reproduction numbers for seasonal and pandemic\ninfluenza in temperate countries) implies that effective measures such as vaccination\nbefore the pandemic wave could be important, however little is known about the\neffectiveness of such measures during a pandemic wave.\nAs it could be observed all around the world, vaccination campaigns and A(H1N1)v\noutbreaks overlapped in time, thus the preseasonal vaccination assumption does not\nhold. There is an ongoing race between the vaccination campaign and the dynamics\nof the outbreak, hence it is necessary to implement a dynamic modelling of the\ninterplay of the vaccination and the influenza transmission.\nAge structured models are necessary for multiple reasons: various age groups have\nvery different contact profiles thus playing different roles in transmitting the disease. Furthermore, age specific susceptibility, infectiousness, vaccine efficacy and\nmortality patterns are also important issues. We developed a compartmental model\nto track five age groups. We incorporated the fact that it takes about two weeks to\ndevelop antibodies and acquire immunity after vaccination, and during this intermediate period an individual might contract the disease (Nichol 1998). This time\ndelay is shown to be a significant factor during the outbreak. To our knowledge this\nis the first modelling study which reckons with that.\nHere we evaluate vaccination strategies for two outcome measures: overall attack\nrate and total deaths estimated from recent mortality data of the novel A(H1N1)v\npandemic (Donaldson et al. 2009 ). Though there are several other possible interventions (antiviral treatment, social distancing, school closures etc., see Alexander\net al. 2007, 2009 ; Ferguson et al. 2006; Merler et al. 2009; Moghadas et al. 2008,\n2009; Gojovic et al. 2009) to mitigate the burden of the outbreak, here we focus\nonly on vaccination. The effect of other control measures can be taken into account\nin a simplified way by lowering the reproduction number. To show the robustness of\nour results, a sensitivity analysis was performed with respect to several key model\nparameters, such as the basic reproduction number, vaccine efficacy, epidemiologic\ncharacteristics of the virus, moreover the duration and the intensity of the vaccination campaign.\nIn the following, we detail the model structure, discuss our results and their epidemiological implications, and place them in the context of the ongoing battle against\n\n\fAGE SPECIFIC VACCINATION SCHEDULING\n\n3\n\nthe nascent A(H1N1)v pandemic. Our aim was to develop a model that can be\napplied to explore the effect of alternative vaccination strategies, and this model\ncan also be used for predicting the future incidence of cases in the next wave of\npandemic influenza.\n2. The model\nOur model is a compartmental differential system, based on the classical SEIR\n(Susceptible, Exposed, Infective, Recovered) model. We have incorporated three\nfeatures to develop a more realistic model:\ni) we introduced age structure with five age groups, where the contacts between age\ngroups are derived from the European survey Mossong et al. 2008,\nii) we account for the fact that it takes up to 14 days after vaccination to produce\nsufficient amount of antibodies to provide immunity (CDC 2009, Nichol 1998),\niii) we did not assume vaccination before the outbreak, because we want to model\nthe interplay between the dynamics of the epidemics and the vaccination campaign.\nIt is assumed that the transmission of infection occurs through close contacts between susceptibles and infected individuals, where for simplicity, mass action incidence is used (Alexander et al. 2008, 2009; Arino et al. 2006). Exposed individuals\nin the class E cannot transmit the disease in the latent period, during which viral\ntitres increase to detectable and transmissible levels (Baccam et al. 2006). Since the\nlatent period is relatively short, we neglected the small probability of someone receiving the vaccine while being in the class E. We assume further that infected and\nrecovered individuals will not be vaccinated, therefore vaccination is administered\nonly for individuals in the S class until we reach the targeted 60% coverage on the\npopulation level. If the pool of susceptibles depleted before reaching that coverage,\nwe stopped vaccination in the simulations. However, contacts of cases may have already been infected by the time that vaccine is taken up, because high proportion of\ninfection is not laboratory confirmed, and also asymptomatic or atypical infections\ncan also occur. The magnitude of such limitation is less of a problem when considering the first epidemic wave of pandemic influenza than for the second or third wave.\nThe model tracks 5 age groups, distributed as the 2005 European Union population\n(Eurostat 2006). We considered the case when a single dose is sufficient to induce\nimmunity. A single dose is recommended for the Hungarian vaccine (Johansen et\nal. 2009; Vajo et al. 2009), and according to the most up-to-date recommendation\nof the European Medicines Agency that can be sufficient for other vaccines as well,\nsee also (Nishiura & Iwata 2009; Greenberg et al. 2009). The five age groups we\nconsidered are 0-9, 10-19, 20-39, 40-64 and 65+ years old. In the model equations we\nuse the upper index i = 1, ..., 5 to denote the corresponding age group, respectively.\nBased on the most recent serological data (Miller et al. 2010), we assumed no preexisting immunity in the first four age groups, and 20% reduction in susceptibility\nin the elder age group.\nVaccinated individuals move into the class W for an intermediate period, during that\ninfection is still possible. After 14 days they become immune with probability q, and\nmove into the RW class, or if the vaccine was ineffective, then they move into SV ,\nmeaning that they are still susceptible to the disease despite having been vaccinated.\nSuch individuals will not receive the vaccine again, but can come into contact with\ninfectious individuals and contract the disease. It is assumed in the baseline scenario\nthat the same epidemiological parameters apply to these individuals as to the nonvaccinated, i.e. \u03bcEV = \u03bcE and \u03bcIV = \u03bcI , except that we assumed a reduction of\n\n\f4\n\nDI\u00c1NA KNIPL, GERGELY R\u00d6ST\n\ninfectiousness for unsuccessfully vaccinated persons (see Table 1). This factor \u03b4 is\nset to be 0.75 in the baseline scenario, but other possibilities for the parameters of\nunsuccessfully vaccinated individuals are also discussed in the sensitivity analysis.\nThe epidemiological parameters, such as the length of incubation and infectious\nperiods, vaccine efficacy, transmission rates etc. are taken from the literature and\ndiscussed in detail in Section 3.\nThe transmission diagram of our model is presented in Figure 1, without the age\nstructure.\nThus, altogether we have 50 compartments and the following non-autonomous system of 50 differential equations\n\u1e60 i = \u2212S i \u03bbi \u2212 V i\n\n\u1e60Vi = (1 \u2212 qi )\u03bcW W i \u2212 SVi \u03bbi\n\n\u0116 i = (S i + W i )\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bciE E i\nI \u0307i = \u03bciE E i \u2212 \u03bciI I i\n\n\u0116Vi = SVi \u03bbi \u2212 \u03bciEV EVi\nI \u0307Vi = \u03bciEV EVi \u2212 \u03bciIV IVi\n\n\u1e58i = \u03bciI I i\n\n\u1e58Vi = \u03bciIV IVi\n\n\u1e86 i = V i \u2212 W i \u03bbi \u2212 \u03bcW W i\n\ni\n= qi \u03bcW W i ,\n\u1e58W\n\nwhere the force of infection is given by\ni\n\n\u03bb =\n\n5\nX\n\n(\u03b2j,i (I j + \u03b4IVj ))\n\nj=1\n\nand the upper index i = 1, .., 5 represents the corresponding age group. Here V i =\nV i (t) are the prescribed piecewise constant vaccination rate functions determined by\nthe specific strategy. In our equations we ignored mortality, since even a 40% attack\nrate and 0.05% case fatality rate cause very minor changes in the demographic\nscale, and the number of disease induced deaths can be derived simply from the\nattack rate and the case fatality ratio. Nevertheless, the age specific mortality is an\nimportant issue, and such information can be obtained from the age specific attack\nrates calculated by the model and the mortality patterns when they are available,\nsee Section 4 and 5. We start the model at t = 0, with time measured in days,\nintroducing a small number of infectives into the population. The time T refers to\nthe delay in start of the vaccination campaign, thus V i (t) = 0 for any t < T , and\nin a case of a three months campaign, V i (t) = 0 for t > T + 90 as well.\n\n3. Parameters\nThe epidemiological parameters are summarized in Table 1. So far there are no\nprecise clinical estimates of the basic model parameters \u03bcE and \u03bcI defining the inverse average exposed and infectious time durations, hence we used plausible values\nfrom the range estimated in Balcan et al. 2009 . We used the age distribution of\nthe European Union (Eurostat 2006) for our simulations. For vaccine efficacy we\nused the same parameters as in Medlock & Galvani 2009, obtained from Basta et\nal. 2008. In the sensitivity analysis we considered various values for the reduction\nof infectiousness \u03b4 and vaccine efficacy against infection qi . The value of \u03bcW , representing the inverse time duration needed to develop antibodies to gain immunity,\nis the same as US CDC 2009 uses, being in accordance with Nichol 1998.\n\n\fAGE SPECIFIC VACCINATION SCHEDULING\n\n5\n\nFigure 1.

Description of the model parameters\n\n3.1. Baseline scenario. The severity of the influenza outbreak and the initial\nrate of increase depends on the basic reproduction number R0 , which is among\nthe most urgently estimated quantities in a pandemic situation, and defined as the\naverage number of secondary infectious cases caused by an infected individual in\na population consisting of susceptibles only (Diekmann et al. 2010; Heffernan et\nal. 2005). In the baseline scenario we assumed that the basic reproduction number\nR0 is 1.4. This value seems to be reasonable (Truite et al. 2009) and similar to\nmean estimates of seasonal infuenza in temperate countries , however, we considered\nmilder and more severe cases ( R0 = 1.2, R0 = 1.6, R0 = 1.8) as well. We run\ncomputer simulations for a population of N = 100000. Due to the special form of\nthe equations, the results are scalable and the attack rates (defined as the fraction\nof susceptibles who do not contract the disease during the course of the outbreak)\nremain the same for populations of any size. In the baseline scenario, after the start\nof the vaccination campaign at time T , vaccine is administered to 0.667% of the\npopulation per day, thus reaching a coverage of 60% at the end of the campaign at\ntime T + 90. This is an intensive, but realizable vaccination plan (Falus 2009). The\ndistribution of these vaccines among the age groups on any given day is determined\nby the specific strategy (see Section 4). Based on European Union statistics Eurostat\n\n\f6\n\nDI\u00c1NA KNIPL, GERGELY R\u00d6ST\n\n2006, we use the following age distribution per 100 000 citizens:\nN1\nN2\nN3\nN4\nN5\n10500 12000 28500 32500 16500\n\n,\n\nwhere N i is the total number of individuals in age group i, and N =\n\nP5\n\ni=1\n\nN i.\n\n3.2. The contact matrix and the basic reproduction numbers. There are\npractical reasons for using five age groups besides for simplicity: we think that targeting smaller groups is not feasible in a real situation, and we can not expect to\nhave vaccination data with such details. Also, in view of the data in Mossong et\nal. 2008, the population can be divided into these five age groups with more or\nless similar contact profiles within these larger groups, which are then easier to be\ntargeted. Following Medlock & Galvani 2009, we used the European survey data\nMossong et al. 2008 to estimate the transmission rates between age groups. That\nsurvey dealt with 17 age groups (0,1-4,5-9,10-14,..,70-74 and 75+) in 8 European\ncountries. Since we work with different age groups, after averaging the European\ncontact matrices from the 8 countries weighted by their population size, we calculated a 5 \u00d7 5 contact matrix C\u0304 = (c\u0304i,j ), using weighted averaging based on EU age\ndistribution (Eurostat 2006) to combine smaller age groups into the larger ones.\nSince contacts are assumed to be mutual, following Medlock & Galvani 2009, we\nperformed a symmetrization procedure to ensure that the total number of contacts\nbetween two age groups are consistent: we set\nc\u0304i,j N i + c\u0304j,i N j\n.\n2N i\nEventually, we obtained the contact matrix\n\uf8eb\n5, 3580 1, 0865 3, 0404 2, 4847\n\uf8ec 0, 9507 10, 2827 2, 8148 3, 6215\n\uf8ec\nC=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 1, 1201 1, 1852 6, 5220 4, 1938\n\uf8ed 0, 8027 1, 3372 3, 6776 5, 2632\n0, 5187 0, 5638 1, 5573 2, 7531\nci,j =\n\n0, 8150\n0, 7752\n0, 9016\n1, 3977\n2, 0742\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nwhere the elements ci,j represent the number of contacts an individual in age group\ni has with individuals in age group j, and satisfy ci,j N i = cj,i N j .\nAge specific contact rates can be converted to the age specific transmission rates \u03b2i,j\nas follows. An infected individual in age group i has ci,j contacts with individuals in\nage group j, at some time t a fraction S j (t)/N j of those contacts are with susceptibles, SVj (t)/N j with vaccinated susceptibles and W j (t)/N j with recent vaccinees.\nThus, we obtain that the rates of infections in age group j by individuals in age\ngroup i is given by\n\u03b4SVj (t) i\nW j (t) i\nS j (t) i\nI\n(t),\n\u03b2c\nI\n(t),\n\u03b2c\nI (t),\ni,j\ni,j\nNj\nNj\nNj\nwhere \u03b2 is a transmission parameter, which involves the normalization of the contacts to unit time and the infectiousness of the virus. By defining \u03b2i,j = \u03b2ci,j /N j ,\nwe obtain the model equations and force of infections described in Section 2. Using\nthe transmission rates we can construct the next generation matrix N (see Diekmann et al. 2010), and then fit \u03b2 numerically to ensure that the basic reproduction\nnumber, which is the dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix, is equal\nto 1.4.\n\u03b2ci,j\n\n\fAGE SPECIFIC VACCINATION SCHEDULING\n\n7\n\nSince in the early phase of the pandemic S0j \u2248 \u033aj N j (where \u033aj = 1 for j = 1, 2, 3, 4\nand \u033a5 = 0.8), the number of infections generated in age group j by an infected individual from age group j is given by \u03b2i,j S0j /\u03bcI . The elements of the next generation\nmatrix are given by this formula, i.e.\n\u0010 \u03b2\u033aj c \u0011\n\u0010 \u03b2 Sj \u0011\ni,j\ni,j 0\n=\n,\nN = (ni,j ) =\n\u03bcI\n\u03bcI\ni,j\ni,j\nthus they can be obtained from the elements of the contact matrix.\nBy standard numerical procedure we find that if \u03b2 = 0.0334, then the dominant\neigenvalue of N , which is the basic reproduction number R0 , equals to 1.4, thus in\nthe baseline scenario we use this \u03b2 value.\nNote that in this scenario n2,2 > 1, which means that there is a self sustaining\noutbreak in the age group of 10-19 years old individuals.\n4. Strategies, simulations and results\nWe simulate, evaluate and compare five possible strategies for the vaccination schedule. In each of the strategies, vaccine is administered to about 0.667% of the population daily and a 60% vaccination coverage is achieved by the end of the campaign\nin every age groups. Each strategy determines the piecewise constant vaccination\nfunctions V i (t) straightforward. The overall attack rates and the final size of the\nepidemic are estimated from taking the values of the non-infected classes after the\npandemic wave, at t = 250.\nThe case fatality ratio is yet to be determined for many countries, however estimated\nrates are coming down for industrialised countries to as low as 0.02% (ECDC 2009,\nPresanis et al. 2009; meaning that one in five thousand cases has a fatal outcome).\nMost recent risk assessments suggest that in European countries the overall fatality rate may be less or similar to a moderate influenza season. However, age\nspecific rates are expected to show a very different picture, with higher mortality\nin younger age-groups. Here we used the recently published data (Donaldson et al.\n2009, Vaillant et. al 2009), and calculated with the mortality rate 20:12:30:60:80 fatal outcomes per 100 000 cases in the five age groups to compare the five strategies,\nbut other patterns are also discussed in the sensitivity analysis.\n4.1. The five strategies. Here we describe the five strategies we compare. For each\nstrategy, 60% overall vaccination coverage is reached by the end of the campaign in\nthe baseline scenario.\nA - Conventional strategy\nThis strategy consists of three phases and we constructed it to resemble the official\nstrategy of Hungarian health authorities. Similar strategies have been proposed for\nmany other countries.\nPhase 1 : 42 days, vaccination of high risk groups, elder people, emergency and\nhealth care personnel, workers of critical infrastructure facilities. According to the\nage specific breakdown (which is described in Section 3.1), 2000, 16000, 10000 people\nare being vaccinated in age groups 0-19, 20-64, 65+, respectively.\nPhase 2 : Vaccination campaign in schools for 18 days, 12000 children of age \u2264 19\nyears old.\nPhase 3 : In the last 30 days, vaccination is given to the general population such\nthat we achieve the 60% coverage in each group by the end of this phase.\nB - Uniform strategy\n\n\f8\n\nDI\u00c1NA KNIPL, GERGELY R\u00d6ST\n\nThis is the universal vaccination strategy, when there are no prioritized age groups,\nso we assume that vaccination is completely random and 0.667% of each age group\nis vaccinated daily, throughout the 90 days.\nC - Elderly first strategy\nPhased vaccination of elder people (age \u2265 65 years old) first up to 60 % coverage\nbefore vaccine is delivered to the other part of the population (age \u2264 64 years). This\ntwo-phase strategy is similar to plans usually implemented against seasonal flu.\nPhase 1 : 15 days, 65+ years old\nPhase 2 : 75 days, 0-64 years old\nD - Children first strategy\nPhased vaccination of children (age \u2264 18 years old) first up to 70 % coverage before\nvaccine is delivered to adults was studied in Yang et al. 2009. The only difference\nhere in the D strategy is that coverage goes up to only 60%, and our prioritized age\ngroup is the 0-19 years old. Specifically:\nPhase 1 : 20 days, 0-19 years old\nPhase 2 : 70 days 20+ years old\nE - By contacts strategy\nHere we take advantage of the full contact structure of our five age groups, and\nvaccinate them in five phases, according to the decreasing order of their total contact\nnumbers.\nPhase 1 : 10-19 years old, 11 days\nPhase 2 : 20-39 years old, 26 days\nPhase 3 : 0-9 years old, 10 days\nPhase 4 : 40-64 years old, 29 days\nPhase 5 : 65+ years old, 15 days\n4.2. Main results. We have evaluated and compared the above described five\nstrategies for various delays in start of the vaccination. Increasing population level\nimmunity may slow down the spread of infection, reduce the height of the epidemic\npeak thus decreasing the pressure on health care facilities, and significantly reduce\nmorbidity and mortality of pandemic infections. Thus our main outcome measures\nare the age specific attack rates and number of fatal cases.\nThe overall attack rates are summarized in Figure 2 and Figure 3. We can see that\nby means of illness attack rate, the strategy E gives the best result, followed by\nD, B, A and C in that order, whenever we start the vaccination campaign. In case\nof an early start on day 1, all of the five strategies are effective with attack rates\nbetween 1-4 %. As the delay in start of vaccination increases, the significance of our\nchoice of strategy becomes more apparent. We can advert the infection of 10 % of\nthe population by choosing strategy E instead of C if the campaign starts between\ndays 30 and 45. If vaccination starts on day 50, the attack rates will be between\n21-29 %. For the sake of comparison we note that in the absence of a vaccination\ncampaign, R0 = 1.4 results in an a 42% attack rate.\nThe delay T in start of vaccination is a crucial factor on the final size of the pandemics: even for the best strategy, ten days delay can increase the overall attack\nrate by up to 6% (see Figure 3).\nFigure 4 shows the attack rates in the five age groups for the five strategies and\nalso for the case when there is no vaccination at all. Depending on which age group\n\n\fAGE SPECIFIC VACCINATION SCHEDULING\n\n9\n\nFigure 2. Overall attack rates of the five strategies for various\ndelays T in starting the vaccination campaign (A - Conventional,\nB - Uniform, C - Elderly first, D - Children first, E - By contacts)\nfor R0 = 1.4. Without vaccination, the attack rate is 42%.\n\nFigure 3. Overall illness attack rates of the five strategies plotted\nversus the delay T (A - Conventional, B - Uniform, C - Elderly\nfirst, D - Children first, E - By contacts) for R0 = 1.4. Without\nvaccination, the attack rate is 42%.\nwe want to protect, we can choose different strategies. Since age groups peak at\ndifferent times, the delay in start of vaccination may also be a factor in choosing\nour strategy: for example for T = 50 the strategy C, which gives priority to the\nelder age group, protects them essentially to the same extent as any other strategy\n(attack rates slightly over 10%), while there are large differences in the attack rates\nfor the age groups 0-9 and 10-19 years old. For T = 0 and T = 25 the strategy\n\n\f10\n\nDI\u00c1NA KNIPL, GERGELY R\u00d6ST\n\nE protects the elder better with 0.5% and 3.2% attack rates versus the 1.4% and\n5.4% attack rates that correspond to the strategy C among the elder age group,\ndespite the fact that in the strategy E they are the last to get the vaccine. This\nvery interesting result may seem counterintuitive, however some similar findings\nhave already been obtained for preseasonal vaccination in Medlock & Galvani 2009.\nFurthermore, the public health implication of this phenomenon is that if the actual\npolicy is to protect a specific age group, then the best strategy depends also on\nthe delay in start of vaccination, therefore authorities must be able to adapt their\nstrategy as the pandemic evolves. Very high attack rates can be observed among\nteenagers for strategies A, B and C.\n\nFigure 4. Age specific attack rates of the five strategies in the\nage groups 0-9, 10-19, 20-39, 40-64 and 65+ years old, represented\nby the five columns, respectively, for various delays T in start of\nthe campaign: T = 0 (blue), T = 25 (red) and T = 50 (yellow)\nfor R0 = 1.4. The colours indicate the increases in the attack\nrates for longer delays in start of the campaign. The strategies: A\n- Conventional, B - Uniform, C - Elderly first, D - Children first,\nE - By contacts, 0 - No vaccination.\n\nThe comparison of the strategies by means of mortality is depicted in Figure 5. The\nrelation between the strategies for this outcome measure is similar to the attack\nrates: strategy E being the best and C the worst. However, we can observe a much\nbigger difference between the best and the worst schedules: the overall mortality is\n50% higher for the strategy C than for the strategy E for a late start in vaccination,\nand six times higher for an early start. The reason of this huge difference is partly\nthat compared to the elderly, the recent H1N1 causes unusually high mortality\namong children and young adults, who has the most contacts as well and prioritized\nby strategy E. The age specific details can be seen in Figure 6.\nThe epidemic curves in the five age groups are plotted in Figure 7 for strategies\nA and E with T = 25. Notice that age groups peak in different times, and for the\nstrategy A the teenagers are affected disproportionally by the epidemics.\n\n\fAGE SPECIFIC VACCINATION SCHEDULING\n\n11\n\nFigure 5. Overall mortality (number of deaths in a population of\n100000) of the five strategies (A - Conventional, B - Uniform, C Elderly first, D - Children first, E - By contacts) for T = 0, T = 25\nand T = 50 days delay in start of the vaccination campaign, using\nthe mortality pattern of the baseline scenario (sum of the products\nof the age specific attack rates, case fatality rates and population\nsizes), for R0 = 1.4. The colours indicate the increases in the attack\nrates for longer delays in start of the campaign.\n\n5. Sensitivity analysis\nWe performed a systematic analysis to reveal the sensitivity to several key parameters. Our results turned out to be very robust in the sense that modifying some\nparameters do not change which strategy is the best if our outcome measure is\nthe overall attack rate. However, the mortality pattern is important to select our\nstrategy to minimize the number of fatal cases. Changing several parameters at the\nsame time, we did not observe any unexpected behaviour.\nBasic reproduction number\nWe consider a less (R0 = 1.2) and a more severe (R0 = 1.6) situation, Figure 7 shows\nthe dependence of the attack rates on T . In the milder case, we can observe that for\nthe early start of vaccination for all five strategies the attack rates are below 1%,\nthe difference between the strategies shows only for delayed start, attack rates being\nbetween 2-4%. Thus a 60% vaccination coverage is able to prevent a large outbreak\neven if the campaign starts relatively late. Note that without vaccination, the attack\nrate is 22.5%. In the more severe situation in the case of late start each strategy can\nmitigate the pandemic only a little and there is not much difference between the\nattack rates: about 50% for all strategies. In the absence of vaccination, the attack\nrate is 55%, thus in this situation the vaccination campaigns are not effective. There\nis a significant difference between the strategies if we start the campaign early, in\nthis case with strategy E we have only 5% attack rate, while for the worst strategy\nC the attack rate is as high as 19% if T = 0. In the even more severe case R0 = 1.8,\nfor the early start the attack rates vary between 18 and 36%, strategy E being far\nthe best. However, for the late start the difference between the strategies mostly\n\n\f12\n\nDI\u00c1NA KNIPL, GERGELY R\u00d6ST\n\nFigure 6. Epidemic curves (absolute numbers of infections) in\nthe age groups for strategies A (conventional) and E (by contacts),\nwhen vaccination starts on day 25, in a population of 100 000 in\nthe baseline scenario ( R0 = 1.4).\nvanishes and the attack rates exceed 60%, being very close to the 64% attack rate\nof the no vaccination case.\nVaccine efficacy\nMonitoring the serological responses to influenza vaccines alone is not sufficient to\nestablish evidence that a vaccine is effective, because there has been no clear relationship shown between serological response to influenza vaccination and subsequent\nmorbidity and mortality. Vaccine effectiveness measures with clinical outcomes may\nprovide better estimate for the evaluation of how much protection the vaccine may\nprovide, however such estimates are not readily available at this stage of the vaccination campaign against pandemic influenza. Considering less effective (qi = 0.7\nfor i = 1, ...4 and q5 = 0.5), or more effective vaccine (qi = 0.9 for i = 1, ...4 and\nq5 = 0.7) against infection (see Basta et al. 2008, CDC 2008) resulted in slightly\nlower and higher attack rates, respectively, typically by 0.5-1.5%.\nReduction of infectiousness\nDifferent scenarios were considered regarding the infectiousness of vaccinees. Taking\n\u03b4 = 1 (no reduction in infectiousness) or \u03b4 = 0.5 (more significant reduction in\ninfectiousness) did not change much in the outcomes, the differences in the attack\nrates were less than 1%, compared to the baseline scenario \u03b4 = 0.75. Assuming\nthat unsuccessful vaccination shortens the infectious period by one day in case of\ninfection, i.e. 1/\u03bcIV = 2, the attack rates are decreased by less than 1%.\nIntensity of vaccination campaign\nFor the purposes of this study we assumed that 60% coverage can be reached in 90\ndays in the baseline scenario. In the sensitivity analysis, we compared the strategies\nA and E with respect to the intensity and the length of the vaccination campaign,\nadjusting the phases accordingly. Assuming that we complete the vaccination of 60%\nof the population in 120 days (i.e. vaccine is administered to 0.5% of the population\ndaily), then the attack rates were at most 4% higher for the strategy E, and 6%\nhigher for the strategy A, depending on the delay in start of the campaign. A less\nintensive campaign enlarged the differences between the strategies, which implies\n\n\fAGE SPECIFIC VACCINATION SCHEDULING\n\n13\n\nthat choosing the best strategy is even more important if the vaccine availability or\nthe capacity of the health care system is limited.\nWe found another counterintuitive result regarding the strategy A: vaccinating 60%\nin 120 days gives a worse outcome than vaccinating 45% in 90 days. The reason\nbehind this phenomenon is that if we adjust our phases to the given time intervals,\nthan in the first case the phases will be longer and the most important age groups\nin the second phase receive the vaccine in such a delay that outweighs the benefits\nof vaccinating more people, and vaccinations after day 90 has very limited effect on\nthe outcome.\nA much less intensive campaign, vaccination of only 30% in 90 days resulted in\ndrastically higher overall attack rates, up to 12%, depending on the strategy and\nthe delay in start of the campaign. Strategy E is consistently the best option for a\nless intensive campaign, having 5-6% smaller attack rate than strategy A for both\nearly and late start of the campaign.\nFor a very intensive campaign, when 80% coverage is reached within 90 days, the\nattack rates are lower, for example for strategy E it is 17% for T = 50, 4% for\nT = 25 and below 2% for T \u2264 16.\nMortality patterns\nFor the sake of comparison, we examined the outcomes of the strategies for a mortality pattern which is somewhat different from what we see for A(H1N1)v, namely\nthe 1957 pandemic. Suggested by Serfling et al. 1967, we assumed that the fatality\nrates for the five age groups per 100 000 cases have the proportions 0.1:0:0.1:1:4,\nmeaning that mortality is four times higher in the elderly, than in the age group\n40-64 years old etc. We observed that in this case there is no significant difference\nin the mortalities between the five strategies, since the vast majority of fatal cases\noccurs in the elder age groups, where the five strategies resulted in similar attack\nrates.\nIt is important to notice that in Figure 5 we overestimated the number of fatal cases\nfor strategy A, since then the high risk groups are vaccinated first in each age group\nthus proportionally less high risk people will be infected than in the other strategies,\nreducing the mortality. This factor of reduction is hard to determine (see Fleming\n& Elliott 2006 ), since we need to estimate the fraction of high risk individuals in\neach age group, and also their relative risk for a fatal outcome. Nevertheless, we can\nsee that the ratio of the attack rates for strategy E and strategy A is 0.3 for the\ncase of an early start, and 0.65 for a late start, thus to fully compensate the higher\nattack rate, prioritizing high risk groups in strategy A must result in a significantly\nlower mortality.\nTime duration to develop immunity after vaccination\nIgnoring the time duration 1/\u03bcW needed to develop immunity decreased the attack\nrates significantly, in some cases by 8% even for the best strategy. This shows the\nimportance of incorporating this time period into our model, otherwise the attack\nrates are seriously underestimated.\nApplicability of the model\nTo illustrate the applicability of our approach, we fitted the model to the Hungarian\ndata of the first wave of A(H1N1)v. The epidemic curve was reconstructed using\nthe public reports of the National Center for Epidemiology (www.oek.hu). For the\n\n\f14\n\nDI\u00c1NA KNIPL, GERGELY R\u00d6ST\n\nFigure 7. Overall attack rates plotted versus the delay T in start\nof the vaccination campaign for the cases R0 = 1.2 and R0 =\n1.6, for the five strategies (A - Conventional, B - Uniform, C Elderly first, D - Children first, E - By contacts). In the absence\nof vaccination, the attack rate is 22.5% for R0 = 1.2 and 55% for\nR0 = 1.6\n\nFigure 8. Epidemic curve (thin curve with dots) in Hungary (population 10 million) and the fitted model (thick curve), taking into\naccount the reduced contact numbers during school holidays. Vaccinations started on day 29.\n\nsimulation, we fixed the epidemiological parameters as in Table 1, employed publicly available vaccination data (www.jarvany.hu) and performed a grid search with\nrespect to the basic reproduction number and the reduction of contacts during holidays to find the best fit by means of ordinary least square method. The result can\nbe seen on Figure 8, where day 1 corresponds to September 1 and R0 \u2248 1.3. The\nimmunizations started on day 29, but with very low intensity first. The intensity\nincreased only in a later phase of the outbreak. In Hungary, roughly 30% of the\npopulation received the vaccine in a three months period. The decrease in cases\nafter day 50 is due to a one week national school holiday. Note that we included\nthis very preliminary figure solely for the sake of illustration, to demonstrate the\napplicability of our model in a real life situation, a more comprehensive and thorough epidemiological analysis of the Hungarian data is in progress, which is beyond\nthe scope of this study.\n\n\fAGE SPECIFIC VACCINATION SCHEDULING\n\n15\n\n6. Conclusions\nWe have extended an established age structured mathematical population model\nof influenza transmission, incorporating the interplay between the vaccination campaign and the dynamics of the outbreak. The model has allowed us to compare\nvarious age specific scheduling strategies for the overall attack rate, age specific\nattack rates and number of fatal cases. We found that if 60% coverage is targeted\nwithin each age group, the best scheduling scheme E (i.e. prioritizing age groups according to the number of social contacts) can reduce the overall attack rate by 5-10\n% and mortality by up to 30% relative to the worst strategy, depending on the delay\nin start of vaccination. Previous studies suggest that this can be further optimized\nby allocating more vaccines to young age groups, however the scope of our study\nwas to examine the significance of the age specific timing in the schedule, without\nchanging the overall coverage for the age groups. Our results clearly demonstrate\nthat consideration of age specific transmission is paramount to vaccination schedule\nplanning.\nSeveral mathematical models have been developed to evaluate age specific vaccination strategies and the impact of timing for influenza outbreaks (Matrajt & Longini\n2010, Medlock et al. 2010, Mylius et al. 2008, Sypsa et al. 2009, Tuite et al. 2010).\nThey mostly focused on vaccine allocation (for example in Mylius et al. 2008 and\nMatrajt & Longini 2010, all vaccines are administered at once), while our main\npurpose was to explore the effect of temporal order of prioritizations. Generally,\nrecommendations depend on the progress of the epidemic. Mylius et al. 2008 and\nMatrajt & Longini 2010 suggested prioritizing high risk groups if vaccine becomes\navailable in a later phase of the epidemic, while if available early, they suggested to\nprotect high-transmission groups. We have consistently found that the attack rates\nare the lowest when high-transmission groups are prioritized. However, this is most\nimportant when we start the vaccination early. For a late start and higher reproduction numbers, the differences between attack rates are much smaller. Thus, if the\nattack rates are similar, protecting the most vulnerable first can be a better strategy\nresulting lower mortality. Medlock et al. 2010 was led to a similar conclusion, hence\nour findings are in accordance with previous results in the literature. However, our\nconclusions can be viewed as a refinement of earlier results in the sense that in our\nmodel vaccines are administered continuously, and using our methodology we can\neasily compare the attack rates of various scheduling schemes for any delay in start\nof the campaign and any daily vaccine uptake. We demonstrated that, besides allocation, the scheduling of age groups itself can have a huge impact on the outcome\nof the epidemic, especially when vaccine is available early and the reproduction\nnumber is relatively low.\nSince optimizing public health responses to this new pathogen requires difficult decisions over short timelines, a significant advantage of our approach compared to\nsome other (stochastic, or agent based network) models in the literature is its relative simplicity. It can be easily reproduced by other researchers and adapted to the\nsituations of various countries where the availability of vaccine will be delayed, to\nidentify better strategies to mitigate the burden of the pandemic. Also, such strategies can be translated into a realizable public health policy. Other real life concerns,\nsuch as to protect the most vulnerable by early vaccination of high risk groups,\nor vaccinating health care and emergency personnel, and constraints in vaccine\navailability or the capacity of the health care system can be readily incorporated.\nFurthermore, the uncertainties involved in the parameters were assessed through a\n\n\f16\n\nDI\u00c1NA KNIPL, GERGELY R\u00d6ST\n\nsensitivity analysis to examine whether such variation results in markedly different\noutcomes. The sensitivity analysis showed the robustness of our results. However,\nthe strategy of public health authorities must be adaptive (see Chowell et al. 2009\nfor a Mexican case study), especially when there is a race between the spread of\nthe infection and the vaccination campaign, and certain parameters are clarified\nonly during the outbreak. As the mortality pattern becomes clear as the pandemic\nprogresses, it might be necessary to switch to a different strategy to minimize the\nnumber of fatal cases.\nFinally, we wish to emphasize the utmost importance of the early start of the\nvaccination campaign: ten days delay may cause a significant, up to 6 % increase in\nthe overall attack rate.\nAcknowledgements:\nDK was supported by the Hungary-Serbia IPA Cross-border Co-operation programme, HU-SRB/0901/221/088.
