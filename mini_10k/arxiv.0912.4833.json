However,\nunderstanding nucleon resonance excitation is a serious\nchallenge due to the non-perturbative nature of QCD at\nlow energies. This makes the situation for the excited\nstates of the nucleon (N and \u2206 resonances) still unclear:\nmany more states are predicted than observed and states\nwith certain quantum numbers appear at energies much\nlower than predicted. This has been known for a long\ntime as the \"missing resonance\" problem [1]. In quark\nmodels (see Ref. [2] for reviews), the number of excited\nstates is determined by the effective degrees of freedom,\nwhile their ordering and decay properties are related to\nthe residual quark-quark interaction.\nThe effective degrees of freedom in standard nonrelativistic quark models are three equivalent valence\nquarks with one-gluon exchange interactions. A different\nclass of models uses interactions that give rise to a quarkdiquark clustering of the baryon [3]. If there is a tightly\nbound diquark, only two degrees of freedom are available\nat low energies; thus, fewer states are predicted. Furthermore, selection rules in the decay pattern may arise\nfrom the quantum numbers of a diquark. More states\nare provided by collective models of the baryon, like the\nalgebraic approach [4], or in the framework of flux-tube\nmodels [5], which are motivated by lattice QCD. So far,\nhowever, the experimentally observed number of states is\nstill far lower than predicted by the quark-diquark models.\nExperimentally, most of our present knowledge of\n\n\u2217 Current address:Catholic University of America, Washington,\nD.C. 20064\n\u2020 Current address:Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility,\nNewport News, Virginia 23606\n\u2021 Current address:Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos,\nNew Mexico 87545\n\u00a7 Current address:Christopher Newport University, Newport News,\nVirginia 23606\n\u00b6 Current address:Edinburgh University, Edinburgh EH9 3JZ,\nUnited Kingdom\n\u2217\u2217 Current address:College of William and Mary, Williamsburg,\nVirginia 23187-8795\n\nbaryon resonances comes from reactions involving pions\nin the initial and/or final states. For increasing masses,\nboth the energy overlap of the resonances and meson production make it more difficult to separate the resonance\ncontributions. A possible explanation for the missing resonance problem could be that pionic coupling to the\nintermediate N \u2217 or \u2206\u2217 states is weak and that many\nof the missing states only become visible in other reaction channels. Photoproduction of non-strange resonances detected via decay into strange particles offers two\nbenefits: (1) two-body KY (where Y denotes any hyperon) final states are easier to analyze than the threebody \u03c0\u03c0N final states that dominate the decays at higher\nmasses resonances; (2) couplings of nucleon resonances\nto KY final states are expected to differ from those to\n\u03c0N and \u03c0\u03c0N final states [6]. Therefore, looking in the\nstrangeness sector casts a different light on the resonance\nexcitation spectrum, and thus, may emphasize resonances not revealed in \u03c0N scattering. To date, however, the\nPDG compilation [7] gives poorly known K\u039b couplings\nfor only five well-established resonances, and no K\u03a3 couplings for any resonances. Mapping out the spectrum of\nexcited states that decay into KY particles is therefore\ncrucial to provide a deeper insight into the underlying\ndegrees of freedom of the nucleon and to discriminate\namong different models.\nThe search for missing resonances requires more than\nthe study of the hadronic mass spectrum. In fact, QCD\ncannot be directly tested against experimental N \u2217 mass\nspectra without a model for the production dynamics [8].\nThus, in addition to the s-channel contributions, important in the resonance region in order to reproduce the\ninvariant mass spectra, the t- and u-channel meson and\nbaryon exchanges are also necessary in the theoretical\ndescription. The former are needed in order to describe\nthe diffractive part of the production, and u-channel diagrams are necessary to describe the back-angle production. Thus, measurements that can constrain the phenomenology for these reactions are just as important as\nfinding one or more of the missing resonances.\nA large amount of cross-section data of hyperon photoproduction on the proton has been published in recent years by the SAPHIR [9], CB-ELSA/TAPS [10, 11],\n\n\f3\nCLAS [12, 13] and LEPS [14] collaborations from threshold up to E\u03b3 \u223c 3.8 GeV over a wide angular range. The\npolarization of the recoil hyperon has also been measured by CLAS [13, 15], SAPHIR [9] and GRAAL [16],\nwhile photon beam asymmetries have been measured by\nLEPS [17]. Despite this large body of data, theoretical\nambiguities still exist. In fact, theorists have found conflicting evidence for resonances using isobar models [18],\ncoupled-channel [19\u201321] and partial wave analysis [22]\napproaches.\nIn this situation the necessity of more data and from\ndifferent channels is evident. In particular, for Y photoproduction on the neutron, one can take full advantage of the isospin symmetry, adding significant constraints on the \u03b3KN Y coupling constants [23]. Unfortunately, data of hyperon photoproduction on neutrons are\nvery scarce, with the only available data from LEPS [24],\ncovering a limited photon energy range at very forward\nkaon angles.\nIn this paper high-precision cross sections of the reaction \u03b3d \u2192 K + \u03a3\u2212 (p) in a broad kinematic range\nare presented.\nThe data were acquired using the\nCLAS detector [25] housed in Hall B at Jefferson Lab.\nA bremsstrahlung photon beam produced by a 3.776\nGeV continuous electron beam hitting a 10\u22124 radiationlengths gold foil was used [26]. Tagged photons, in the\nenergy range from 0.8 to 3.6 GeV, were directed onto a\nliquid-deuterium target. With an electron beam current\nof \u223c 25 nA, the photon flux incident on the deuterium\ntarget was \u223c 108 \u03b3/s.\nThe primary kaon, and the pion and neutron coming\nfrom the \u03a3\u2212 decay (with branching fraction b\u03a3\u2212 \u223c 100%)\nwere detected by CLAS. The low-energy spectator proton was reconstructed using the missing-mass technique.\nFiducial cuts were applied to both real and Monte-Carlo\nsimulated data in order to exclude regions where the detector acceptance was not well understood and the regions where the drift chambers or scintillator efficiencies\nwere not well known. Neutral particles are identified in\nCLAS as clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeters that\nare not associated with any charged track in the drift\nchambers. Neutral clusters with \u03b2 > 0.9 are then identified as photons, while clusters with \u03b2 < 0.9 are associated\nwith neutrons.\nIn order to identify good \u03b3d \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 nX candidates,\nwith the missing particle X consistent with a spectator\nproton, we first applied a cut on the missing momentum\nPX \u2264 0.25 GeV/c. The remaining events, integrated over\nall angles, were divided into 100 MeV wide bins in photon\nenergy. In each bin, the missing-mass distribution was\nused to select events consistent with a missing spectator\nproton.\nThe missing-mass distribution for the photon energy\nbin of 2.0\u20132.1 GeV in Fig. 1 shows a clear proton peak\nand a smaller structure at higher masses. The latter,\nthat starts to appear at photon energies & 2 GeV, is due\nto photoproduction events of \u03a3\u2217 (1385)\u2212 and K \u2217 (892)+ .\nThe \u03a3\u2217 (1385)\u2212 decays into \u03a3\u03c0 with b\u03a3\u2217 \u223c 12% and\n\nthe K \u2217 (892)+ decays into K\u03c0 with bK \u2217 \u223c 100%. Each\nmissing-mass distribution was fit with two Gaussian line\nshapes plus a polynomial curve. The total fit and each\ncontribution separately are shown in Fig. 1. Events with\na spectator proton were selected by applying a 3\u03c3 cut\naround the main peak. The background contribution\ncoming from \u03a3\u2217 (1385)\u2212 and K \u2217 (892)+ events was estimated to be between 1 and 3% and then subtracted.\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n1.4\nMM(K+ \u03c0- n X) (GeV)\n\nFIG. 1: Missing-mass distribution of the \u03b3d \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 nX reaction for photon energy in the bin 2.0\u20132.1 GeV. The solid\nline is the total fit to the distribution. The dot-dashed line\nrepresents the proton distribution, the dashed line is the contribution of the events with an additional \u03c0 0 as explained in\nthe text, and the dotted line is the background contribution.\nThe two vertical lines represent a 3\u03c3 cut.\n\nAfter the selection of \u03b3d \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 n(p) candidates,\nwe looked for evidence of the presence of \u03a3\u2212 particles\nin the invariant-mass distribution of the pion and neutron. The distribution obtained for data and MC for the\nphoton-energy bin 2.0\u20132.1 GeV is shown in Fig. 2. A\nsharp peak consistent with the \u03a3\u2212 appears on top of a\nsmall, almost flat background. Each distribution was fit\nwith a Lorentzian peak plus a second-order polynomial\nfor the background (in Fig. 2 only the fit of the data is\nshown). The Lorentzian shape has been chosen because\nit reproduces the peak shape of both experimental and\nMC data better than the Gaussian. The final sample of\n\u03b3d \u2192 K + \u03a3\u2212 (p) events was obtained by selecting events\nwithin 3\u0393 around the peak, where \u0393 is the full width at\nhalf maximum of the Lorentzian. The background calculated by integrating the polynomial curve within the\ncuts was subtracted. The total background is generally\nincreasing with the photon energy, and is between 2%\nand 25%.\nFinally, the extracted yield was corrected for the CLAS\ndetector acceptance. For this, \u03b3d \u2192 K + \u03a3\u2212 p events\nwere generated according to the Quark-Gluon Strings\nModel [27, 28]. The Fermi motion of the neutron bound\nin the deuterium nucleus was described by the momentum distribution calculated from the Paris potential [29].\nThe generated events were processed through a GEANTbased Monte Carlo simulation of the CLAS detector, incorporating all of the known subsystem efficiencies and\nresolutions. The simulated data were analyzed by the\nsame software used in the real data processing and analysis. The CLAS acceptance was computed as the ratio\n\n\f4\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n1.12 1.14 1.16 1.18\n\n1.2\n\n1.22 1.24 1.26 1.28\nM(\u03c0- n) (GeV)\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) The n\u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass distribution\nfor data (full histogram) and MC (dashed histogram) in the\nphoton energy range 2.0\u20132.1 GeV. The solid line is the fit\nof the distribution with a Lorentzian peak plus a polynomial\nbackground (the latter represented by the dotted line). The\ntwo vertical lines show the 3\u0393 cut applied to the data sample\nin order to select \u03a3\u2212 events. Only the fit of the data is shown.\n\nbetween the number of events passing all the analysis cuts\nand the number of generated events in each one of the\nc.m.\n100-MeV wide photon energy bins and 0.1-wide cos \u03b8K\nbins.\nThe differential cross section for K + \u03a3\u2212 photoproduction on the neutron was calculated using the following\nrelation:\nW\nb\u03a3\u2212\nd\u03c3\nA Npeak\n=\n(1 \u2212 B) ,\n(1)\nd\u03a9\n\u03c1xNA N\u03b3 \u2206\u03a9\nW\nwhere Npeak\nis the number of the \u03b3d \u2192 K + \u03a3\u2212 (p) events\nweighted by the acceptance of the CLAS detector, N\u03b3 is\nthe number of incident photons, B is the fraction of background events, A is the target molecular weight, NA is\nAvogadro's number, and \u03c1 = 0.163 g/cm3 and x = 24 cm\nare the target density and length, respectively. Photon\nabsorption in the target was also calculated and found to\nbe negligible. Systematic uncertainties of the final cross\nsections contain contributions from the photon flux calculation (4%), target length and density (0.5%), fiducial\ncuts (1\u20133%, depending on the bin), background subtraction (1\u201310%), neutron detection efficiency (0.7%) and the\nMonte Carlo event generator (1.7%). The total systematic uncertainty was obtained by adding in quadrature\neach contribution, bin by bin. Thus, the total systematic uncertainty in our cross section measurements is estimated to be about 4.5\u201313.5%.\nOur final results are shown as full circles in Fig. 3. For\nenergies up to E\u03b3 = 2.1 GeV, the results are shown in\nlinear scale while for higher energies, logarithmic scale\nhas been chosen in order to make more readable the behavior at the backward angles. The error bars represent\nthe total (statistical plus systematic) uncertainties. This\nis the first high-precision determination of \u03a3\u2212 photoproduction on the neutron covering a broad kaon-angle and\nphoton-energy range. At a photon energy of \u223c 1.8 GeV,\n\n[1] N. Isgur and G. Karl, Phys. Rev. D 18, 4187 (1978);\n\na clear forward peak starts to appear and becomes more\nprominent as the photon energy increases. This behavior, that is typically attributed to contributions from tchannel mechanisms, is not observed at lower energies,\nwhere the dominant contributions appear to be from schannel mechanisms. Above \u223c2.1 GeV there are indications of a possible backward peak, which might suggest\nthe presence of u-channel mechanisms.\nThe few LEPS data [24] available for energies 1.5\u20132.4\nGeV and at forward angles are shown in Fig. 3. Since\nthese data have been provided in 50-MeV wide energy\nbins, for comparison with our results the weighted average of two bins has been computed and reported in the\nfigure. They are in good agreement with our results\nwithin the total uncertainties.\nAlso shown in Fig. 3 are the theoretical results of a\nRegge-based calculation (Regge-3 model) [32]. In this\nmodel, the reaction amplitude incorporates the exchange\nof K + and K \u2217 (892)+ Regge trajectories. By adding resonance contributions to the Regge amplitudes, the model\nis able to describe the \u039b and \u03a30 photo- and electroproduction data on the proton reasonably well [33\u201335].\nThe Regge-based model overestimates our results at forward and intermediate angles by about a factor of two.\nAt backward angles the calculated cross section is too\nsmall by an order or magnitude, which is a reflection of\nthe lack of resonances in the model.\nIn conclusion, CLAS has provided the first precise determination of the \u03b3d \u2192 K + \u03a3\u2212 (p) cross section in a\nbroad kinematic range where almost no data are available. Since Final State Interaction (FSI) can be estimated\nto be small (less than 10%) from calculations for the \u039b on\nthe proton [30, 31], the cross section on the free neutron\nare not expected to be significantly different. A comprehensive treatment of FSI and the extraction of the neutron cross section will be given in the forthcoming longer\npaper. These results will significantly contribute to the\nimprovement of the phenomenological analysis of meson\nphotoproduction reactions at medium energies aiming to\nsolve the missing resonance problem.\nWe would like to acknowledge the outstanding efforts\nof the staff of the Accelerator and the Physics Divisions\nat JLab that made this experiment possible.
