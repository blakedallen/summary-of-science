The distribution of\nthe distances between the zeroes and the corresponding lattice points\nis shift-invariant and has a Gaussian-type decay of the tails.\n\nIntroduction\nWe consider the (random) set S of zeroes of a random entire function \u03c8 : C \u2192\nC,\n(0.1)\n\n\u03c8(z) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nzk\n\u03b6k \u221a ,\nk!\nk=0\n\nwhere \u03b60 , \u03b61 , . . . are independent standard complex-valued Gaussian random variables; that is, the distribution NC (0, 1) of each \u03b6k has the density\n\u03c0 \u22121 exp(\u2212|w|2 ) with respect to the Lebesgue measure m on C. Well-known\nas the flat CAZP ('chaotic analytic zero points'), this model is distinguished\nby invariance of the distribution of zero points with respect to the motions\nof the complex plane, see [11] for details and references.\nToy models\nIt is instructive to compare the flat CAZP with simpler ('toy') models of\nrandom point processes in the plane, especially, random perturbations of a\nSupported by the Israel Science Foundation of the Israel Academy of Sciences and\nHumanities\n\u2217\n\n1\n\n\fp\u03c0 2\np\nlattice. The first toy model: each point of the lattice\nZ = { \u03c02 (k +\n2\nli) : k, l \u2208 Z} is deleted at random, independently of others, with probability\n1/2; the remaining points are a random set S1 .

Any lattice with this cell area may be used.\n\n2\n\n\ffor some (dependent) complex-valued random variables \u03bek,l . Of course, it\ncan happen that all points of S are far from the origin, in which case |\u03be0,0 |\nis necessarily large. However, that is an event of small\nprobability. We may\n\u0001\nhope for fast decay of the probability P |\u03bek,l| \u2265 r for large r, uniformly in\nk, l. The uniformity becomes trivial if random variables \u03bek,l are identically\ndistributed. Taking into account invariance of CAZP under shifts of C we\nmay hope for invariance of (\u03bek,l ) under lattice shifts. The hopes come true,\nwhich is our main result, formulated below. Random variables are treated as\nmeasurable functions on the space \u03a9 of two-dimensional arrays \u03be : Z2 \u2192 C\nof complex numbers.\nMain Theorem. There exists a probability measure P on (the Borel \u03c3-field\n2\nof ) the space \u03a9 = CZ\u221a, invariant under shifts of Z2 and such that\n(a) the random set { \u03c0(k + li) + \u03bek,l : k, l \u2208 Z} is distributed like the flat\nCAZP;\n\u0001\n(b) E exp \u03b5|\u03be0,0|2 < \u221e for some \u03b5 > 0.\nItem (a) needs some comments. A 'random set' is a measurable map from\n\u03a9 to a space of sets. We need only locally finite subsets\nP of C. The Borel\n\u03c3-field on that space is generated by functions S 7\u2192\nz\u2208S h(z), where h\nruns over compactly supported continuous (or just Borel) functions C \u2192 R.\nAlternatively, we may represent each set S by its counting measure, which is\nthe same, since the random entire function \u03c8 has only simple zeroes (almost\nsurely). Item (a) means that the two maps\nC, NC (0, 1)\n\n\u0001{0,1,2,... }\n\n2\n\n(CZ , P )\n\nTTTT\nTTTT\nTTTT\nTTT*\n\nnn\nnnn\nn\nn\nnn\nnv nn\n\nthe space of sets\ninduce the same measure on the space of sets. Here the first map\n\u221a a\nP sends\nk\nsequence of coefficients \u03b60 , \u03b61 , . . . into the set of zeroes of \u03c8(z) =\u221a \u03b6k z / k!,\nwhile the second map sends an array (\u03bek,l )k,l into the set { \u03c0(k + li) +\n\u03bek,l : k, l \u2208 Z}. The latter set is locally finite (almost surely), which is a part\nof item (a).\nThe second map on the diagram intertwines natural (measure preserving)\nactions of lattice shifts on \u03a9 and the space of sets. For the first map, the\nsituation is more complicated; only a projective action of shifts is naturally\ndefined on the space of entire functions (or their coefficients), see [11].\nOur\u221aconstruction of the matching between the flat CAZP and the lattice\npoints \u03c0Z2 is not explicit. For this reason, the main theorem gives no information about correlations between \u03bek,l. On large distances, the correlation\n3\n\n\ffunction of the underlying Gaussian process decays rapidly (see for example\n[11, Sect. 3.2]). Probably, \u03bek,l can be chosen as to be nearly independent\non large distances. It is also compatible with the result of [12]. On small\ndistances we expect a negative correlation, for two reasons: the well-known\nrepulsion of close zeroes [5, 3], and the center-of-mass conservation discussed\nin [11, Intoduction].\nExplicit matching?\nIt could be very useful to find an explicit matching between the flat CAZP\nand the lattice points, or equivalently, a transportation of the Lebesgue measure \u03c01 m to the counting measure n\u03c8 of CAZP. By 'transportation' we mean\na map T : C \u2192 C such that \u03c0n\u03c8 = T\u2217 m. Of course, we are interested in\nstationary random transportations T with fast decay of the tails of the distribution of T z \u2212 z. Here, we suggest a natural and explicit construction of\nthe transportation which, in our opinion, deserves a better look2\nConsider the gradient field of the stationary random potential [11, Introduction]\n(0.2)\n\n\u03c6(z) =\n\n1\n1\nlog |\u03c8(z)| \u2212 |z|2\n2\n4\n\n(additional factor 21 on the RHS will be convenient later); the distributional\nLaplacian of \u03c6 equals \u03c0n\u03c8 \u2212 m. The only local minima of the function \u03c6 are\nthe points where it equals \u2212\u221e (since \u03c6 is superharmonic everywhere except\nof these points). We say that the point w belongs to the basin of a zero point\nz \u2208 \u03c8 \u22121 (0) if \u2207\u03c6(w) 6= 0, and the gradient trajectory passing through w\nterminates at z. In other words, if we put a ball at the point (w, \u03c6(w)) on\nthe graph of the function \u03c6, then under the gravitation force (and without\ninertia) the ball will fall through at the point (z, \u2212\u221e).\nWe expect that almost surely one obtains a cellulation of the plane on\nfinite cells, each of them being the basin of some random zero point; i.e. with\nprobability one, nothing escapes to infinity, and nothing arrives from infinity.\nOn the boundary of each cell, the gradient \u2207\u03c6 has zero normal component.\nSince each cell contains exactly one random zero point, by Green's theorem\napplied to the function \u03c6, the area of each cell must equal \u03c0. Define T as\nthe map that sends each basin into the corresponding zero point, then T\ntransports the measure \u03c01 m to the measure n\u03c8 . It would be interesting to\nobtain a good estimate for the diameters of the basins.\n2\n\nIt is inspired by the celebrated Moser homotopic construction [9, Sect. 4] of the diffeomorphism that transports one volume measure to another.\n\n4\n\n\fOther point processes\nIt is instructive to think about possible counterparts of the main theorem\nfor simpler random sets such as the first toy model (Bernoulli process) or\nthe Poisson point process. Here, E|\u03be0,0 | must be infinite, since for a finite\nfragment of size n \u00d7 n the transportation cost between the random set\u221aand\nthe lattice, divided by the number of points, typically exceeds\nconst * ln n\n\u0001\n2\n[2, 14]. The large gap between E|\u03be0,0 | and E exp \u03b5|\u03be0,0 | shows that the\nrandom zeroes are distributed much more evenly than independent random\npoints (see [10], Fig. 1 and comments to it). Note also that (i) stationary\nmatchings between random and deterministic sets are closely related with socalled extra head schemes [7]; (ii) existence of a stationary matching between\nthe Poisson point process on R2 and the lattice follows from existence of a\n'stable marriage of Poisson and Lebesgue' announced recently [7, 6].\nThe reader's guide, I (informal)\nThe proof of the main theorem is based on the formula\n(0.3)\n\n2\u03c0 dn\u03c8 = \u2206 log |\u03c8| dm ,\n\nwhere n\u03c8 is the counting measure on the set of zeroes of \u03c8. The desired array\n(\u03bek,l )k,l may be thought of as a bijective correspondence ('marriage') between\nzeroes of \u03c8 and lattice points. The distance |\u03bek,l| between corresponding\npoints ('fianc\u00e9' and 'bride') must be controlled as to ensure item (b) of the\ntheorem. It is instructive to try first a simpler condition, say, |\u03bek,l| \u2264 100\nfor all k, l. (In fact, it is too much for a typical \u03c8, but let us try to prove it\nanyway.) If such \u03bek,l exist, then clearly\n(0.4)\n\nn\u03c8 (U) \u2264 n(U+r ) and n(U) \u2264 n\u03c8 (U+r )\n\nfor every U \u2282 C; here U+r stands for the r-neighborhood of U, r = 100,\nand n is the counting measure on the lattice. (No measurability is required\nof U, since the measures n, n\u03c8 are discrete. However, it does not harm to\nassume U to be a bounded domain with a smooth boundary.) In fact, (0.4) is\nnecessary and sufficient, which is basically the well-known 'marriage lemma'.\nUsing (0.4) as a sufficient condition, we may replace n by \u03c01 m at the expense\nof some change of the constant r.\n\u0001\n\u0001\nTaking into account that E|\u03c8(z)|2 1/2 = exp 21 |z|2 one could expect\nna\u0131\u0308vely\non C. This can be used to show\nR that the 'potential' (0.2) is bounded\nR\nthat U \u2206\u03c6 dm \u2264 m(U+r \\ U) and \u2212 U+r \u2206\u03c6 dm \u2264 m(U+r \\ U), which gives\n(0.4) since \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0n\u03c8 \u2212 m. Singularity of the potential at zeroes is not\n5\n\n\fan obstacle, since we can replace n\u03c8 by its convolution with a compactly\nsupported smooth measure.\nThe argument sketched above does not work since the smoothed random\npotential is unbounded (for almost all \u03c8). However, it can be mended. Rare\nfluctuations appear somewhere on the infinite plane C, probably far from\nthe origin. In order to get item (b) of the theorem we need some locality;\n|\u03be0,0 | should not be large, whenever the potential is not large in an appropriate neighborhood of the origin. Restrictions on |\u03bek,l| should be adaptive,\nthey should be relaxed around large values of the potential. This idea is\nformalized by introducing on C a metric \u03c1 that depends on \u03c8, and considering \u03c1-neighborhoods U+r . Such metrics \u03c1 are not shift-invariant; rather,\nthe probability distribution on the space of these metrics is shift-invariant.\nFinally, shift invariance of P is ensured.\nThe reader's guide, II (more formal)\nTo build the metric \u03c1, we use an idea borrowed from [8, Section 1.4]. A\nLip(1)-function R : Rd \u2192 (0, \u221e), |R(x) \u2212 R(y)| \u2264 |x \u2212 y|, gives rise to the\nmetric\nZ\n|dz|\n\u03c1(x, y) = inf\n\u03b3\n\u03b3 R(z)\nwhere the infimum is taken over all piece-wise C 1 -curves \u03b3 in Rd connecting\nthe points x and y. We shall call \u03c1 a special metric on Rd , corresponding to\nR (in which case R is always assumed to be a positive Lip(1) function). In\nSect. 1, we list the properties of the metric \u03c1 needed in the rest of the paper;\nin Sect. 2, we construct a Whitney-type partition of unity subordinated to\nthe metric \u03c1.\nThis partition of unity is needed for the following potential theory lemma\nwhich lies in the heart of our argument:\nMain Lemma. There exists const such that if a C 2 -function u : Rd \u2192 R\nand a special metric \u03c1 (corresponding to R) satisfy |u(x)| \u2264 const * R2 (x)\nand \u2206u(x) \u2265 \u22121 for all x, then\nZ\nZ\n\u2206u dm \u2264 m(U+4 \\ U)\n\u2206u dm \u2264 m(U+4 \\ U) ,\n\u2212\nU\n\nU+4\n\nfor every compact set U \u2282 Rd .\nHere U+4 = {y : \u2203x \u2208 U \u03c1(x, y) \u2264 4}. For the proof see Sect. 3.\n\nTo apply this lemma, we smooth the random potential \u03c6 (see (0.2))\nsetting u = \u03c6 \u2217 \u03c7, where \u03c7 is a compactly supported smooth function\n6\n\n\fR\n\u03c7 : C \u2192 [0, \u221e) such that \u03c7 dm = 1 and \u03c7(\u2212z) = \u03c7(z) for all z (the\nchoice of \u03c7 influences only constants), and define the Lip(1)-function R as\nfollows (see (4.1)):\np\n\u0001\nR(z) = max Const * (1 + (|\u03c6| \u2217 \u03c7)(w)) \u2212 |w \u2212 z| .\nw\n\nThen the main lemma combined with the marriage lemma and the general\ninequality |x \u2212 y| \u2264 23\u03c1(x,y) R(x)\u221a(see Lemma 1.4) give us a matching between\nCAZP and \u221a\nthe lattice points \u03c0Z2 such that for every matched pair z \u2208\n\u03c8 \u22121 (0) and \u03c0(k + il)\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u221a\n|z \u2212 \u03c0(k + il)| \u2264 R \u03c0(k + il)\n\n(see Theorem 4.3).\n\u0001\nIt will be shown (see Lemma 5.1) that E exp cR2 (x) \u2264 C. This will\ngive us the subgaussian decay of the tails, thus proving Item (b) of the main\ntheorem.\nIt worth mentioning that the Gaussian nature of the random function \u03c8 is\nused only once, in Sect. 5, when checking the inequality E exp(const *|\u03c6(z)|) \u2264\nConst (uniformly in z). For every random entire function satisfying the\ninequality, its zeroes are a 'perturbed lattice' satisfying E exp(const *|\u03bek,l|2 ) <\nConst (uniformly in k, l). On the other hand, shift-invariance of (\u03bek,l)k,l is\nachieved via shift-invariance of zeroes of \u03c8; the latter was verified using the\nGaussian distribution.\nConvention\nMost of the steps in the proof of the main theorem do not use any special\nproperties of the complex plane and will be done in the Euclidean space Rd .\nThroughout, 'Const' and 'const' mean positive constants (sufficiently large\nand sufficiently small, respectively) depending on the dimension d only, the\nvalues of these constants can be changed at each occurrence. By B(x; r) we\nalways denote the closed ball {y : |x \u2212 y| \u2264 r}.\nAcknowledgment\nWe thank Michael Krivelevich for providing us with the reference [1] and its\ndiscussion, F\u00ebdor Nazarov for bringing to our attention the relevance of the\nclassical Whitney construction, and Yuval Peres for telling us about results\nof the papers [2, 14, 6, 7].\n\n7\n\n\fA class of metrics in Rd\n\n1\n\nSuppose \u03c1 is the special metric corresponding to a Lip(1)-function R : Rd \u2192\n(0, \u221e); i.e.\nZ\n|dz|\n\u03c1(x, y) = inf\n\u03b3\n\u03b3 R(z)\nwhere the infimum is taken over all piece-wise C 1 -curves \u03b3 in Rd connecting\nthe points x and y.

The choice of \u03c7\ninfluences only constants. Given an entire function \u03c8 : C \u2192 C and a constant\n(Const), we define a function R : C \u2192 [1, \u221e] by\np\n\u0001\n(4.1)\nR(z) = max Const * (1 + (|\u03c6| \u2217 \u03c7)(w)) \u2212 |w \u2212 z| ;\nw\n\nhere, as before,\n(4.2)\n\n\u03c6(z) =\n\n1\n2\n\nlog |\u03c8(z)| \u2212 14 |z|2 ,\n\n|\u03c6| is the pointwise absolute value of \u03c6, and |\u03c6| \u2217 \u03c7 is the convolution of these\ntwo functions.\nClearly, R(z) \u2265 Const1/2 > 0 for all z (this time, 'Const' is the same\nas in (4.1)), and the function R is a Lip(1)-function since it is an upper\nenvelope of Lip(1)-functions. Therefore we may construct a special metric \u03c1\ncorresponding to R. Note that \u03c1(x, y) \u2264 Const\u22121/2 |x \u2212 y| for all x, y. If we\nreplace 'Const' with '4 Const', we get another function R2 such that R2 (z) \u2265\n2R(z) for all z, and another special metric \u03c12 such that \u03c12 (x, y) \u2264 21 \u03c1(x, y)\nfor all x, y.\nDue to the Lipschitz property, the function R is finite everywhere in C\nprovided that R(0) < \u221e.\n4.3 Theorem.

For\nevery entire\u221afunction \u03c8 satisfying R(0) < \u221e there exists a bijection between\nthe lattice \u03c0Z2 and the zero set \u03c8 \u22121 (0) (counting with\u221amultiplicities)\n\u221a such\n\u22121\nthat for every pair of corresponding points z \u2208 \u03c8 (0), \u03c0(k + li) \u2208 \u03c0Z2\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(4.4)\n|z \u2212 \u03c0(k + li)| \u2264 R \u03c0(k + li) .\nProof. In order to get (4.4) we will show that\n\u221a\n(4.5)\n\u03c1(z, \u03c0(k + li)) \u2264 5 ,\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the special\nLemma\n\u0001 combination with\n\u221a metric corresponding\n\u221a to R. In\n15\n15\n1.4 it implies |z \u2212 \u03c0(k + li)| \u2264 2 R \u03c0(k + li) ; the constant 2 need not\nappear in (4.4), since it can be absorbed by Const in (4.1). Of course, there\nis nothing sacred in the constant '5' on the RHS of (4.5); any other constant\ndoes the job as well.\n13\n\n\fExistence of a bijection between the lattice points and the set of zeroes\nsatisfying (4.5) follows from inequalities (to be proven)\n(4.6)\n\nn\u03c8 (U) \u2264 n(U+5 ) ,\n\nn(U) \u2264 n\u03c8 (U+5 )\n\nfor every compact U \u2282 C; here U+5 = {y : \u2203x \u2208 U \u03c1(x, y) \u2264 5}, n\u03c8 is the\ncounting measure on the set of zeroes, and n is the counting\n\u221a measure on the\nlattice. Indeed, we say that the marriage\nbetween\nthe\nbride\n\u03c0(k+li) and the\n\u221a\n\u22121\nfianc\u00e9 z \u2208 \u03c8 (0) is possible if \u03c1(z, \u03c0(k +li)) \u2264 5. By the classical marriage\nlemma (we use its extension due to M. Hall [1, p.7]), the first inequality in\n(4.6) guarantees that each bride can find a fianc\u00e9, and the second inequality\nin (4.6) yields that each fianc\u00e9 can find a bride. Then a version of the CantorF. Bernstein theorem [1, Theorem 1.1] gives a matching which covers every\nbride and every fianc\u00e9.\nWe split (4.6) into\n(4.7)\n(4.8)\n\n\u03c0n(U) \u2264 m(U+1 ) ,\n\u03c0n\u03c8 (U) \u2264 m(U+4 ) ,\n\nm(U) \u2264 \u03c0n(U+1 ) ;\nm(U) \u2264 \u03c0n\u03c8 (U+4 ) ;\n\nhere m is the Lebesgue measure on C. Clearly, (4.7) and (4.8) together imply\n(4.6).\nInequalities (4.7) are easy to check, taking into account that by Lemma 1.3\nthe \u03c1-neighborhood U+1 of U contains a sufficiently large Euclidean neighborhood of U, provided that Const in (4.1) is large enough. It remains to\nprove (4.8).\nWe will prove a seemingly weaker (but ultimately equivalent) statement:\n(4.9)\n\n\u03c0n\u03c8 (V ) \u2264 m(W ) ,\n\nm(V ) \u2264 \u03c0n\u03c8 (W )\n\nwhenever V, W are such that V \u2282 U \u2282 U+4 \u2282 W , 1lU \u2217\u03c7 = 1 on V , 1lU+4 \u2217\u03c7 =\n0 outside W . (Here 1lU stands for the indicator function of U.) That is\nsufficient: having (4.9) we get (4.8) after replacing 'Const' with '4 Const'\nin (4.1), as follows. Considering the corresponding R2 , \u03c12 and denoting the\nr-neighborhood w.r.t. \u03c12 by U +r we have U +r \u2283 U+2r (since \u03c12 \u2264 21 \u03c1). Given\n\u0168 , we may apply (4.9) to V = \u0168, U = V+2 , W = V +4 \u2283 V+8 provided that\nConst is large enough. We get \u03c0n\u03c8 (\u0168) \u2264 m(\u0168 +4 ), m(\u0168 ) \u2264 \u03c0n\u03c8 (\u0168 +4 ), which\nis (4.8). It remains to prove (4.9).\nMain lemma 3.1 can be applied to u = \u03c6 \u2217 \u03c7, since condition (3.2) follows\nfrom (4.1), and (3.3) is checked readily:\n\u2206(\u03c6 \u2217 \u03c7) = (\u2206\u03c6) \u2217 \u03c7 = (\u03c0n\u03c8 \u2212 m) \u2217 \u03c7 = \u03c0n\u03c8 \u2217 \u03c7 \u2212 m \u2265 \u2212m.\n14\n\n\fWe get\n\n\u2212\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n(1lU \u2217 \u03c7)\u2206\u03c6 dm =\n\nZ\n\n\u2206(\u03c6 \u2217 \u03c7) dm \u2264 m(U+4 \\ U) ,\n\nUZ\n\n(1lU+4 \u2217 \u03c7)\u2206\u03c6 dm = \u2212\n\nU+4\n\n\u2206(\u03c6 \u2217 \u03c7) dm \u2264 m(U+4 \\ U) .\n\nR\nR\nR\nHowever, (1lU \u2217\u03c7)\u2206\u03c6 dm = (1lU \u2217\u03c7) d(\u03c0n\u03c8 \u2212m) = \u03c0 (1lU \u2217\u03c7) dn\u03c8 \u2212m(U),\ntherefore\nZ\nZ\n\u03c0 (1lU \u2217 \u03c7) dn\u03c8 \u2264 m(U+4 ) ,\nm(U) \u2264 \u03c0 (1lU+4 \u2217 \u03c7) dn\u03c8 ,\nand we get (4.9):\n\u03c0n\u03c8 (V ) \u2264 \u03c0\n\nZ\n\n(1lU \u2217 \u03c7) dn\u03c8 \u2264 m(U+4 ) \u2264 m(W ) ,\nZ\nm(V ) \u2264 m(U) \u2264 \u03c0 (1lU+4 \u2217 \u03c7) dn\u03c8 \u2264 \u03c0n\u03c8 (W ) .\n\nThe proof of Theorem 4.3 is completed.\n\n5\n\nProbabilistic arguments\n\nIn the following lemma, (\u03a9, F , P ) is a probability space.\n5.1 Lemma. Let a random process \u03b7 : Rd \u00d7 \u03a9 \u2192 [0, \u221e) satisfy\n\u0001\n(5.2)\nE exp c\u03b7(x) \u2264 C\n\nfor some C, c \u2208 (0, \u221e) and all x \u2208 Rd , and let R : Rd \u00d7 \u03a9 \u2192 [0, \u221e) be a\nrandom process defined by\np\n\u0001\nR(x) = max Const * (1 + (\u03b7 \u2217 \u03c7)(y)) \u2212 |y \u2212 x| .\ny\n\nThen there are constants c1 and C1 such that for all x \u2208 Rd ,\n\u0001\nE exp c1 R2 (x) \u2264 C1 .\n\nThe constants c1 and C1 depend on c, C, Const, the dimension d, and the\nfunction \u03c7 (introduced in Sect. 4).\n\n15\n\n\fProof.

It evidently implies E exp c1 R2 (0) \u2264 C1 (with different c1 and C1 ). For other x, R(x) is treated similarly.\nWe have\n\u0001\n\u0001\nP R(0) > \u03bb = P \u2203x (\u03b7 \u2217 \u03c7)(x) > const * (\u03bb + |x|)2 \u2212 1 .\nFor large \u03bb we may discard '\u22121' on the RHS (at the expense of changing the\nconstant);\n\u0001\n\u0001\nP R(0) > \u03bb \u2264 P \u2203x (\u03b7 \u2217 \u03c7)(x) > const * \u03bb2 + const * |x|2 .\n\nSince the function \u03b7 is non-negative, all values of the convolution \u03b7 \u2217 \u03c7 are\nbounded by its values on a lattice: given \u03c7 there are constants c2 and C2\nsuch that\n(\u03b7 \u2217 \u03c7)(x) \u2264 C2 max{(\u03b7 \u2217 \u03c7)(y) : y \u2208 c2 Zd , |y \u2212 x| \u2264 C2 } .\nIt follows that\nP R(0) > \u03bb\n\n\u0001\n\n\u2264 P \u2203x \u2208 c2 Zd (\u03b7 \u2217 \u03c7)(x) > c3 \u03bb2 + c3 |x|2\nX\n\u0001\n\u2264\nP (\u03b7 \u2217 \u03c7)(x) > c3 \u03bb2 + c3 |x|2 .\n\n\u0001\n\nx\u2208c2 Zd\n\nLet c be a constant from (5.2).

However,\n\u0001\nexp(c(\u03b7 \u2217 \u03c7)) \u2264 exp(c\u03b7) \u2217 \u03c7\n\n(by convexity of 'exp'), therefore\n\nThus,\n\n(5.2)\n\u0001\nE exp(c(\u03b7 \u2217 \u03c7)) \u2264 E exp(c\u03b7) \u2217 \u03c7 \u2264 C .\n\nP (\u03b7 \u2217 \u03c7)(x) > c3 \u03bb2 + c3 |x|2\n\n\u0001\n\n\u2264 C exp(\u2212c4 \u03bb2 ) exp(\u2212c4 |x|2 ) ,\n\nand the sum over x \u2208 c2 Zd does not exceed C1 exp(\u2212c4 \u03bb2 ), which proves\n(5.3).\n16\n\n\fFormula (0.1) defines a Gaussian random\nprocess \u03c8 : C\u00d7\u03a91 \u2192 C over the\n\u0001{0,1,2,...\n}\nprobability space (\u03a91 , P1 ) = C, NC (0, 1)\n(the space of coefficients\n\u03b6k ). The random variable \u03c8(0) = \u03b60 is distributed NC (0, 1). A simple exercise\nin integration shows that\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n2s\nP log |\u03b60 | \u2265 s = P |\u03b60 | \u2265 es + P |\u03b60| \u2264 e\u2212s \u2264 e\u2212e + e\u22122s \u2264 2e\u22122s ,\n\u0001\ntherefore E exp log |\u03c8(0)| < \u221e. We introduce a process \u03c6 : C \u00d7 \u03a91 \u2192 R\nby (4.2). The distribution of the random potential \u03c6(z) does not depend on\nz (see [11]), therefore\nE exp(2|\u03c6(z)|) \u2264 Const .\nBy Lemma 5.1 applied to \u03b7(z) = |\u03c6(z)|,\n\u0001\nE exp const * R2(z) \u2264 Const ,\n\nwhere\np R(*)\u0001is a random process defined by (4.1). It follows that R(z) =\nO log |z| for |z| \u2192 \u221e, almost surely. (The first part of the Borel-Cantelli\nlemma gives it for z on a lattice; the Lipschitz property of R extends it to all\nz.) By Theorem\n\u0001 4.3, for almost every \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a91 there exists a two-dimensional\narray \u03bek,l(\u03c9) k,l\u2208Z of complex numbers such that\n\u0001\n\u221a\n|\u03bek,l (\u03c9)| \u2264 R \u03c0(k + li)\n\u221a\nfor all k, l, and the set { \u03c0(k + li) + \u03bek,l : k, l \u2208 Z} is equal to the set \u03c8 \u22121 (0)\nof zeroes of \u03c8. However, the array need not be unique.\n\n6\n\nFinal technicalities\n\nIn order to get measurable functions \u03c9 7\u2192 \u03bek,l(\u03c9) one can use one of several\nwell-known results about measurable selectors, such as [13, 5.2.1, 5.2.5, 5.2.6,\n5.4.3, 5.5.8, 5.7.1, 5.12.1]. However, striving to keep the presentation reasonably elementary, we borrow from [13] only a special case of Corollary 5.2.4,\nformulated below.\nGiven a complete separable metric space X, we equip the set K(X) of all\ncompact subsets K \u2282 X with the Hausdorff metric\ndist(K1 , K2 ) = inf{\u03b4 > 0 : K1 \u2282 (K2 )+\u03b4 , K2 \u2282 (K1 )+\u03b4 }\nand the corresponding Borel \u03c3-field (generated by open subsets of K(X)).\nSee the item 'Spaces of compact sets' in [13, Sect. 2.4], see also the item\n17\n\n\f'Effros Borel space' in [13, Sect. 3.3]. The topology of K(X) (known as the\nVietoris topology) is generated by sets of the following two forms:\n{K \u2208 K(X) : K \u2282 U} ,\n{K \u2208 K(X) : K \u2229 U 6= \u2205} ,\nwhere U runs over open subsets of X. Unlike [13], we treat the empty set as\na point of K(X); it is an isolated point (take U = \u2205 in the first form above).\nThe reader can check that the same topology on K(X) is generated also by\nfunctions K(X) \u2192 [\u2212\u221e, \u221e) of the form\nK 7\u2192 max \u03c6 ,\nK\n\nwhere \u03c6 runs over bounded continuous functions X \u2192 R; for K = \u2205 the\nmaximum is \u2212\u221e.\n6.1 Theorem. There exists a Borel map s : K(X) \\ {\u2205} \u2192 X such that\ns(K) \u2208 K for all nonempty K \u2208 K(X).\nA proof is given in [13, 5.2.4], but here is a hint: given \u03b5, choose a\ncountable \u03b5-net {x1 , x2 , . . . } of X and construct\na Borel map s\u03b5 : K(X) \\\n\u0001\n{\u2205} \u2192 {x1 , x2 , . . . } such that dist s\u03b5 (K), K \u2264 \u03b5 for all K.\n\n6.2 Lemma. Let X be a complete separable metric space, Y a metric space,\nand f : X \u2192 Y a continuous map. Then the map K(X) \u00d7 Y \u2192 K(X) defined\nby\n\u0001\n(K, y) 7\u2192 K \u2229 f \u22121 {y}\nis a Borel map.\n\nProof. Let \u03c6 : X \u2192 R be a bounded continuous\n\u0001 function; it is sufficient to\nprove that the maximum of \u03c6 on K \u2229 f \u22121 {y} is a Borel function of (K, y).\nWe use penalization:\n\u0001\nmax\n\u03c6(x) = lim max \u03c6(x) \u2212 n min(1, dist(f (x), y)) .\n\u22121\nx\u2208K\u2229f\n\n({y})\n\nn\u2192\u221e x\u2208K\n\nFor each n the expression is continuous in y uniformly in K and continuous\nin K for every y, therefore it is continuous in (K, y). The limit of a pointwise\nconvergent sequence of such functions is a Borel function.\nWe apply the lemma to the separable Banach space X of all two-dimensional\narrays (\u03bek,l ) of complex numbers satisfying |\u03bek,l | = o(|k + li|), with the norm\nsup\nk,l\n\n|\u03bek,l|\n1 + |k + li|\n18\n\n\f(many other spaces could be used as well), the metrizable space Y of all\nlocally finite measures on C, equipped with the topology of local weak convergence, and the continuous\ninto the sum of\n\u221a map f : X \u2192 Y that sends (\u03bek,l )\u221a\nunit-mass atoms at points \u03c0(k+li)+\u03bek,l . Every function R : \u03c0Z2 \u2192 [0, \u221e)\nsuch that R(z) = o(|z|) for |z| \u2192 \u221e leads to a compact set KR \u2282 X,\n\u0001\n\u221a\n(\u03bek,l ) \u2208 KR \u21d0\u21d2 \u2200k, l |\u03bek,l| \u2264 R \u03c0(k + li) .\n\u0001\nThe map R 7\u2192 KR is continuous w.r.t. the norm kRk = sup R(z)/(1 + |z|) .\nAs was shown in Sect. 5, almost each \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a91 leads to an entire function\n\u03c8\u03c9 , a measure n\u03c9 = n\u03c8\u03c9 (recall (0.3)), and a function R\u03c9 satisfying (much\nmore than) R\u03c9 (z) = o(|z|) and such that the compact set\n\u0001\nK\u03c9 = KR\u03c9 \u2229 f \u22121 {n\u03c9 }\nis nonempty. Measurability in \u03c9 of f\u03c9 implies that of n\u03c9 , R\u03c9 and, by Lemma\n6.2, of K\u03c9 . Combined with Theorem 6.1, it gives us the following result.\n\n6.3 Lemma. There exist random variables \u03bek,l : \u03a91 \u2192 C such that\n\u0001\n(6.4)\nE exp const * |\u03bek,l|2 \u2264 Const\n\u221a\nand for almost all \u03c9 the set { \u03c0(k + li) + \u03bek,l : k, l \u2208 Z} is equal to the set\n\u03c8 \u22121 (0) of zeroes of \u03c8.\nThe joint distribution of random variables \u03bek,l is a probability measure on\n2\nthe space \u03a9 = CZ satisfying Items (a), (b) of the main theorem. However,\nthe measure need not be shift-invariant.\nThe set of all probability measures on \u03a9 satisfying both Item (a) of the\nmain theorem and (6.4) is convex, weakly compact, and invariant under the\naction of Z2 (by continuous operators of shift). By the Markov-Kakutani\ntheorem [4, Sect. 5.10.6], the action has a fixed point P in the set. This\ncompletes the proof of the main theorem.\n\nReferences\n[1] R.
