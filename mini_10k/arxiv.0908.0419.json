It is now\n\nan identify\n\nommonly assumed that\n\nthe energy lands ape of a protein is shaped like a funnel with the native state at the\nbottom [2\u2104. At the same time, the lands ape has many deep lo al minima and high\nbarriers. This is be ause the average protein in the\nintera tions between the atoms\nDue to the large number of\n\nontains thousands of atoms, and\n\nan be both repulsive and attra tive.\nontinuous degrees of freedom and the rough energy\n\nlands ape simulating proteins remains a\n\nomputational hallenge. The time to \u001cnd the\n\nnative stru ture of a protein (the bottom of the funnel) depends both on the roughness\nof the energy lands ape and the steepness of the funnel. The more pronoun ed the\nfunnel is, the faster the protein will fold. This is one reason for the popularity of the Go\nmodel [3, 4, 5\u2104. Its basi\n\nassumption is that only intera tion present in the native state\n\nof a protein are relevant for the folding pro ess. An appropriate energy fun tion then\nignores non-native intera tions and rewards native intera tions. Hen e, the Go model\nrepresents a perfe t funnel model and has none of the roughness normally asso iated\nwith the protein-folding energy lands ape. In their 1981 paper [3\u2104,e.g, Abe and Go\nused a latti e model where ea h amino a id o\n\nupied a single latti e site. If two amino\n\na ids are on adja ent sites that are neighbors in the native state, the system gained\n\n\u01eb\n\nin energy.\n\nThis type of\n\nonta t potential inherently\n\nannot distinguish between\n\nthe original native state and its mirror image. Go-like energy terms are usually only\nde\u001cned between heavy atoms in the protein ba kbone and therefore la k the detail of\nall-atom for e \u001celds. On the other hand, all-atom simulations relying on present energy\nfun tions utilize a number of approximations that may lead to additional spurious\nminima [6, 7, 8\u2104 and therefore to an energy lands ape with an arti\u001c ially in reased\nroughness. As a\n\nonsequen e, all-atom simulations are usually too slow to allow an\n\n\fProtein Simulations ombining an All-Atom For e Field with a Go-Term\n\n2\n\nNative stru ture of the 46 amino-a id long segment of Protein A\n(1bdd) used as native referen e stru ture.

In prin iple, this\n\nan be done by adding a Go-like term to\n\nthe all-atom energy fun tion. For instan e, Pogorelov and Luthey-S hulten used this\nmethod to speed up mole ular dynami s simulations of the folding of the\n[9\u2104.
