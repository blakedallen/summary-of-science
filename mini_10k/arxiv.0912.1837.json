Ortega et al.: A multiwavelength study towards IRAS 18544+0112\n\n1. Introduction\nStar formation processes start when a pressure-bounded, self-gravitating molecular clump\nbecomes gravitationally unstable. As summarized by Whitworth et al. (1994a,b), the action\nof an expanding nebula can produce gravitationally unstable shocked layers of interstellar\ngas. For example, the expansion of an HII region can sweep up the surrounding molecular\ngas into a dense shell, which then fragments and forms new massive stars (\"collect and\ncollapse\" model; see Elmegreen & Lada 1977). Several recent works support this model (e.g.\nDeharveng et al. 2005; Comer\u00f3n et al. 2005; Zavagno et al. 2006; Pomar\u00e8s et al. 2009). On\nthe other hand, shockwaves from expanding wind- and/or supernova- driven superbubbles\ncan also trigger cloud collapse and star formation, but at larger scales. Numerical studies\n(Vanhala & Cameron 1998; Melioli et al. 2006) demonstrated that the effect caused by\na passing shockwave mainly depends on the shock-type: close to the supernova remnant\n(SNR) the shockwave disrupts the ambient molecular clouds and thus terminates the star\nformation process; however, a little further away from the SNR the shock velocity decreases,\nand cloud collapse is possible if the right circumstances were given.\nThis work is part of a systematic study towards IR sources embedded in molecular condensations with evidence of being affected by SNRs shock fronts or expanding HII regions.\nIn a previous work, Paron et al. (2009) studied the infrared (IR) source IRAS 18542+0114\nlocated near the border of the SNR W44. They discovered that this source is probably a\nmassive young stellar object (MYSO) located at the border of the HII region G034.8\u22120.7\nwhich is evolving within a molecular cloud. In this work, we present a study of the neighboring source IRAS 18544+0112, another IR source embedded in the same molecular cloud.\nIt is important to remark that the molecular cloud, the HII region G034.8\u22120.7 and the\nSNR W44 are not only located in the same region in the plane of the sky but also at the\nsame distance from the Sun, at about 3 kpc (corresponding to the kinematic velocity of\nvLSR \u223c 45 km s\u22121 , Paron et al. 2009 and references therein).\nThe source investigated in this Paper, IRAS 18544+0112, was cataloged as a MYSO\nand a high mass protostellar object (HMPO) by Molinari et al. (1996) and Kumar & Grave\n(2007), respectively. On the basis of the analysis of new molecular data and near- and midIR data, we present a multiwavelength study of the IR source aiming to discern its origin\nand evolutionary stage.\n\n2. IRAS 18544+0112 and its environment\nFigure 1 shows a two-color IR image of the HII region G034.8\u22120.7. We show in green the\nSpitzer-IRAC 8 \u03bcm emission and in red the Spitzer-MIPSGAL 24 \u03bcm emission. Yellow\ncorresponds to regions where both emissions overlap. The white contours represent the\n13\n\nCO J=1\u20130 line emission distribution (as extracted from the Galactic Ring Survey (GRS;\n\nJackson et al. 2006) averaged over the velocity interval from 36 to 45 km s\u22121 .\nThe 8 \u03bcm emission, which arises mainly from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\nmolecules (PAHs; Leger & Puget 1984) and an underlying continuum attributed to very\nsmall grains, is observed enclosing the 24 \u03bcm emission that is originated in the heated dust\nof the HII region G034.8\u22120.7. These molecules cannot survive inside HII regions and are\n\n\fM. E. Ortega et al.: A multiwavelength study towards IRAS 18544+0112\n\n3\n\nFig. 1.

White contours at 0.4, 0.6, 1 and 1.2 K represent the\n\n13\n\n\u22121\n\ndistribution integrated between the velocity range from 36 to 45 km s\n\nCO J=1\u20130 line emission\n\n.\n\nlocated over the photodissociation regions (PDRs) that encircle the ionized gas (Cesarsky\net al. 1996). The PDRs are the interphase zone between the ionized and molecular gas, and\nits presence evidences the interaction between them. A well defined 8 \u03bcm arc-like structure\nis observed bordering the HII region G034.8\u22120.7 towards lower Galactic latitudes. It is\nimportant to note that the ionized region is partially bordered by two molecular clouds\nwhich are part of the giant molecular complex (GMC) G34.8\u22120.6. The morphology of the\nmolecular clouds, as seen in the\n\n13\n\nCO J=1\u20130 line, suggests that they are shaped by the\n\naction of the HII region.\nOn the other hand, IRAS 18544+0112, located at (l, b) = (34.\u25e6 69, \u20130.\u25e6 65), appears as a\nbright yellow knot. From Fig. 1 it can be noticed that this IR source is located in a bulge\nshaped molecular gas condensation which is observed in the velocity interval from 36 to 45\nkm s\u22121 .\nFigure 2 shows a two-color image of IRAS 18544+0112 , where green and red are the\n8 \u03bcm and 24 \u03bcm emission, respectively. The observed 8 \u03bcm emission distribution shows a\nshell-like structure of about 1.\u2032 5 in size (\u223c 1.4 pc at a distance of 3 kpc), bright filaments and\ndiffuse emission. The emission at 24 \u03bcm is observed mainly inside the shell-like structure.\nSince most HMPOs present molecular outflows, we now analyze whether this phenomenon is taking place in the region.\nThe IRAC 4.5 \u03bcm band contains lines that may be excited by high velocity shocks, such\nas those expected when protostellar outflows crash into the ambient ISM (Cyganowski et al.\n2008) or when a SNR interacts with a molecular cloud. We thus inspected the IRAC 4.5\n\u03bcm emission distribution in the area.\n\n\f4\n\nM. E. Ortega et al.: A multiwavelength study towards IRAS 18544+0112\n\nFig. 2.

The contours correspond to the 1.4 GHz radio continuum emission at 17 and\n35 K, which depict the border of the HII region G034.8\u22120.7 and the SE border of the SNR W44,\nrespectively.\n\nFigure 3 shows a Spitzer-IRAC three-color image of a square region of 22\u2032 in size. The\nthree IR bands presented are: 3.6 \u03bcm (in blue), 4.5 \u03bcm (in green) and 8 \u03bcm (in red). The\nwhite contours represent the radio continuum emission at 1.4 GHz as extracted from the\nVGPS (VLA Galactic Plane Survey; Stil et al. 2006), which depict the SE border of the\nSNR W44 and the border of the radio continuum emission associated with the HII region\nG034.8\u22120.7 encompassing the PDR.\n\n\fM. E. Ortega et al.: A multiwavelength study towards IRAS 18544+0112\n\n5\n\nAn inspection of Fig. 3 shows that the source IRAS 18542+0114 studied by Paron et al.\n(2009), appears slightly extended in the 4.5 \u03bcm emission (green). Such a characteristic is\nsuggestive of a YSO origin for the emission, a condition that was confirmed by Paron et al.\n(2009) after discovering associated molecular outflows. Figure 3 also shows some extended\ndiffuse filaments in this IRAC band, which are probably illuminating molecular gas shocked\nby the SNR. In the case of the source studied in this work, IRAS 18544+0112, it does not\npresent significant emission in the 4.5 \u03bcm band. Indeed, this source is clearly brighter at 8\n\u03bcm than at 4.5 \u03bcm, suggesting that there is no outflow activity in the region.\nWith the purpose to analyze the small scale distribution and dynamic of the molecular\ngas associated with IRAS 18544+0112 , we carried out observations of the 12 CO, 13 CO J=32, HCO+ J=4-3, and CS J=7-6 lines towards a region of 90\u2032\u2032 \u00d790\u2032\u2032 around this IR source\nusing the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE; Ezawa et al. 2004).\n\n3. New molecular observations\nThe molecular observations were performed on June 25, 2008 with the 10 m ASTE\nTelescope. We used the CATS345 GHz band receiver, which is a two-single band SIS\nreceiver remotely tunable in the LO frequency range of 324-372 GHz. We simultaneously\nobserved\n\n12\n\nCO J=3\u20132 at 345.796 GHz and HCO+ J=4\u20133 at 356.734 GHz, mapping a re-\n\ngion of 90\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 90\u2032\u2032 centered at the position of IRAS 18544+0112, (l, b) = (34.\u25e6 69, \u20130.\u25e6 65).\nThe mapping grid spacing was 10\u2032\u2032 and the integration time was 72 sec. per pointing.\nAdditionally, we observed\n\n13\n\nCO J=3\u20132 at 330.588 GHz and CS J=7\u20136 at 342.883 GHz\n\ntowards the center of the region. All the observations were performed in position-switching\nmode. The off-position was (l, b) = (34.\u25e6 87, \u20130.\u25e6 14), which was checked to be free of emission.\nWe used the XF digital spectrometer with a bandwidth and spectral resolution set\nto 128 MHz and 125 kHz, respectively. The velocity resolution was 0.11 km s\u22121 and the\nhalf-power beamwidth (HPBW) was 22\u2032\u2032 at 345 GHz. The system temperature varied from\nTsys = 400 to 700 K. The typical rms noise (in units of Tmb ) ranged between 0.1 and 0.4\nK, and the main beam efficiency was \u03b7mb \u223c 0.65.\nThe spectra were Hanning-smoothed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and only\nlinear or/and some third order polinomia were used for baseline fitting. The spectra were\nprocessed using the XSpec software package developed at the Onsala Space Observatory.\n\n4. Molecular analysis\nAs it was shown in Fig. 1, IRAS 18544+0112 appears embedded in a molecular clump,\nwhich is part of the GMC G34.8\u22120.6.\nFigure 4 (left) shows the\n\n12\n\nCO J=3\u20132 spectra obtained from a region of 90\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 90\u2032\u2032 cen-\n\ntered at the position of IRAS 18544+0112 and Fig.4 (right) presents a spectrum obtained\ntowards the center of the region. Figure 5 displays an average spectrum of\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nobtained towards the center of the clump at (l, b) = (34. 69, \u20130. 65). All the\nin this region present a dip at v \u223c 44 km s\n\n\u22121\n\n13\n12\n\nCO J=3\u20132\n\nCO profiles\n\n. Such a narrow dip points to a self-absorption\n\norigin instead of two 12 CO emission components with very close kinematical velocities. We\nnotice that the v \u223c 44 km s\u22121 dip is very close to the peak velocity of the\n\n13\n\nCO J=3\u20132\n\n\f6\n\nM. E. Ortega et al.: A multiwavelength study towards IRAS 18544+0112\n\nFig. 4. Left:\n\n12\n\nCO J=3\u20132 spectra obtained towards IRAS 18544+0112. The velocity range of\n\neach spectrum is between 20 and 70 km s\u22121 . The color scale corresponds to the emission at 8\u03bcm\nassociated with IRAS 18544+0112 , as extracted from Spitzer-IRAC. Right: 12 CO J=3\u20132 spectrum\ntowards the center of the region.\n\nline, which is an optically thinner line. Such correspondence strongly suggests that the dip\nin the 12 CO profiles is in fact caused by self-absorption by less excited gas (see for example\nZhou et al. 1993).\nSince we are searching for indicators of active star formation in this IR source, the\npresence of this dip is interesting because it is known that the 12 CO J=3\u20132 line has almost\nalways been observed self-absorbed in star-forming regions (Johnstone et al. 2003).\nAdditionally, we note that the\n\n12\n\nCO J=3\u20132 emission does not show any evidence of\n\noutflow activity in the region, which agrees with the faint 4.5 \u03bcm emission mentioned in\nSect. 2. The non-detection of the HCO+ J=4\u20133 and CS J=7\u20136, molecular species that are\nenhanced in the interphase layer between the outflows and the surrounding molecular core\nwhere a YSO is forming (Hogerheijde et al. 1998; Rawlings et al. 2004) points in the same\ndirection.\nOn the other hand, Fig. 4 clearly shows that most of the\n\n12\n\nCO profiles in the re-\n\ngion present a redshifted component brighter than the blueshifted one, suggesting that\nthe molecular gas is expanding. This is because in an expanding cloud a line emission is\ncomposed by red and blueshifted photons. In the case of an optically thick line, such as\nthe\n\n12\n\nCO J=3\u20132, the redshifted photons will encounter fewer absorbing material (which is\n\nexpanding outward) than would blueshifted photons and hence have greater probabilities\nof escape (e.g. Leung 1978; Zhou 1992; Lehtinen 1997).\nTo estimate the physical parameters of the molecular clump where IRAS 18544+0112\nis embedded, we determine the line parameters of the\n\n13\n\nCO J=3\u20132 line from a Gaussian\n\nfitting. We obtain: Tmb \u223c (5.7 \u00b1 0.5)K, VLSR \u223c (45.4 \u00b1 0.4)km s\u22121 , \u2206v \u223c (2.0 \u00b1 0.2) km\ns\u22121 and I \u223c (12 \u00b1 1) K km s\u22121 , where Tmb represents the peak brightness temperature,\nVLSR the central velocity referring to the local standard of rest, \u2206v the line width and I\nthe integrated line intensity. Errors are a formal 1\u03c3 value for the model of the Gaussian\nline shape.\n\n\fM. E. Ortega et al.: A multiwavelength study towards IRAS 18544+0112\n\nFig. 5.\n\n13\n\n7\n\nCO J=3\u20132 profile obtained towards the center of IRAS 18544+0112.\n\nUsing the\n\n13\n\nCO J=3\u20132 and J=1\u20130 lines we calculated the ratio of the integrated line\n\nintensities (13 R3\u22122/1\u22120 ). The 13 CO J=1\u20130 line was extracted from the GRS and the J=3\u20132\nline was convolved to the J=1\u20130 beam. We obtained\n\n13\n\nR3\u22122/1\u22120 \u223c 1.\n\nAssuming LTE conditions and a beam filling factor of 1, which of course may not be\ncompletely true but allows us to make an initial guess, we use the\n\n12\n\nCO J=3\u20132 emission\n\ntowards the center of the analyzed region to estimate an excitation temperature, Tex . As\nnoticed above, this emission appears self-absorbed, showing a dip between the blue and red\nemission components. Thus, we use an average between the Tmb of both components to\n13\n\nobtain Tex \u223c 15 K. Using this factor and the parameters obtained for the\n\nCO J=3\u20132, we\n\nderive an optical depth for this line of \u03c4 13 \u223c 0.2 and a 13 CO column density of N(13 CO) \u223c\n2.2 \u00d7 1015 cm\u22122 . Adopting the 12 CO and 13 CO relationships of N(H2 )/N(12 CO)= 105 and\nN(12 CO)/N(13 CO)= 89 (Guan et al. 2008) and taking into account that\nas estimated above, we obtain an H2 column density of N(H2 ) \u223c 2.0 \u00d7 10\nassuming a spherical geometry for the clump as seen in the\n\n13\n\n13\n\n21\n\nR3\u22122/1\u22120 = 1\n\ncm\u22122 . Finally,\n\nCO J=1\u20130 line (Fig. 1-left)\n\nwith a radius of \u223c 0.7 pc, we estimate a mass and a volume density of \u223c 1.7 \u00d7 102 M\u2299 ,\nand \u223c 3.2 \u00d7 103 cm\u22123 , respectively.\n\n5. Is IRAS 18544+0112 an ultracompact HII region?\nIn view of the lack of outflow activity in the area, a possible explanation is that\nIRAS 18544+0112 is an evolved high-massive protostellar object that has finished its accretion phase. Since the next step in the life of these objects is to develop an ultracompact\nHII (UCHII) region we looked for the presence of ionized gas. The fact that this source\nlies in the same region of the sky than the SNR W44 and the HII region G 34.7\u20130.8, makes\nit difficult to discern whether there is radio emission related to IRAS 18544+0112. An\ninspection of the 1420 MHz image obtained from the VGPS does shows the presence of\nemission at the position of IRAS 18544+0112 , but its extended morphology suggests that\nit is most probably related to G 34.7\u20130.8. To avoid the contamination of extended radio\nsources, we have inspected the 1420 MHz radio continuum image obtained from the NRAO\nVLA Sky Survey (NVSS; Condon et al. 1998). No radio continuum emission is detected at\nthe position of IRAS 18544+0112. This agrees with the null detection reported by Hughes\n& MacLeod (1994) in the direction of this source.\n\n\f8\n\nM. E. Ortega et al.: A multiwavelength study towards IRAS 18544+0112\n\nFrom the cataloged IRAS fluxes of IRAS 18544+0112 and assuming a distance of 3\nkpc, we estimated the corresponding IR luminosity LIR and dust temperature Td . The IR\nluminosity was estimated on the basis of the four-bands IRAS measurements (12, 25, 60\nand 100 \u03bcm) following Chan & Fich (1995) as LIR (L\u2299 )= 1.58 SIR (Jy) D2 (kpc), where\nSIR is the integrated flux given by SIR = 1.3(S12 +S25 )+0.7(S25 +S60 )+0.2(S60 +S100 ) and\nSi is the flux density in the IRAS band i expressed in Jy. We obtained LIR \u223c (7.9 \u00b1 1.6)\n\u00d7 103 L\u2299 .\nAdopting standard parameters for dust grains (Draine & Lee 1984), the dust temperature can be derived from the relation Td (K) = (95.94/ln Bn ), where Bn = 1.6673+n\nS100 /S60 is the modified Planck function, and n is a parameter related to the absorption\nefficiency of the dust (\u03ba\u03bd \u03b1 \u03bd n ). We obtained Td \u223c (29.0 \u00b1 5.0) K for the adopted value\nn=1. The estimated dust temperature of about 29 K for IRAS 18544+0112 is quite low for\na UCHII region, which typically has temperatures of about 200 K (Ball et al. 1996), while\nit agrees with the ones derived for high mass protostellar candidates by Sridharan et al.\n(2002).\nIn summary, from the observed characteristics we suggest that IRAS 18544+0112 is\nnot yet a UCHII region.\n\n6. A search of MYSO candidates in IRAS 18544+0112\nTo search for MYSO candidates associated with IRAS 18544+0112 we performed a nearinfrared photometric analysis of all the sources that are enclosed within the borders of\nthe IR source as seen in the 8 \u03bcm band (see e.g. Figure 2). We used the 2MASS All-Sky\nPoint Source Catalogue (Skrutskie et al. 2006) in bands J (1.25 \u03bcm), H (1.65 \u03bcm) and KS\n(2.17 \u03bcm), selecting only the sources detected in at least two bands. We found 13 sources\nin this region which are listed in Table 1 and shown in Fig. 6 (a) - (c). In Table 1 we\npresent the source numbers (same as in the following figures), the Galactic coordinates\nin degrees, the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) designation and the J, H and KS\nmagnitudes in cols. 1 to 7, respectively. Figure 6 (a) - (c) displays the spatial location of\nthese sources superimposed over: the 8 \u03bcm emission (a), the near infrared JHK three-color\nimage extracted from the 2MASS (b), and the optical emission as extracted from the 2nd\nDigitized Sky Survey Blue (DSS2-B) (c). The dashed circle represents the area in which\nwe searched for the mentioned sources.\nFigures 7 and 8 display the (H-Ks) versus (J-H) color-color (CC) diagram and the\n(H-Ks) versus Ks color-magnitude (CM) diagram, respectively, of the 13 selected 2MASS\nsources.\nFigure 7 shows that sources one to four, seven and twelve lie in the region of sources\nwith infrared excess. In particular sources two and three appear as the most reddened ones.\nSources six, nine, eleven and thirteen correspond to normally reddened main sequence stars\nand sources eight and ten, the most conspicuos ones in the optical image (Fig. 6c), are\nprobably no reddened foreground stars.\nAccording to the CM diagram (Fig. 8), sources two, three, and nine are the earliest\nspectral type stars in the region. Sources six and, thirteen lie in the region of the giant\n\n\fM. E.

Moreover, as Figure 6 (c) shows, sources one, five, eight, and ten\nare detected in the DSS2-B optical band which, given the high obscuration of the region,\nsuggests that they are probably foreground stars.\nThus, based on both diagrams, we conclude that the most likely high mass protostars\nrelated to IRAS 18544+0112 would be sources two and three.

Ortega et al.: A multiwavelength study towards IRAS 18544+0112\n\n11\n\nof the 24 \u03bcm emission while source two is located onto the nebulas's border, suggests that\nsource three is the main one responsible for the observed infrared nebula.\n\n7. Possible scenario\nIn this Section we discuss a possible formation scenario for IRAS 18544+0112.\nAs mentioned in Sect. 2, the presence of a PDR bordering the HII region G034.8\u22120.7\ntogether with the observed morphology of its associated molecular cloud, are clear evidence\nof the fact that the HII region perturbs its enviroment.\nThe IR source IRAS 18544+0112 is seen in projection inside the HII region G034.8\u22120.7,\nwhile IRAS 18542+0114 (Paron et al. 2009) is located upon its border (see Fig. 9). Based\non an infrared and molecular study, Paron et al. (2009) found that IRAS 18542+0114 is\na MYSO with molecular outflow activity and whose formation was probably triggered by\nthe expansion of G034.8\u22120.7 onto the molecular cloud. In this context, we suggest that\nthe HII region G034.8\u22120.7 has also triggered the formation of IRAS 18544+0112.\nThe observational differences found between both IRAS sources as well as their relative\nlocation with respect to the center of the HII region G034.8\u22120.7, suggest that the associated shockfront reached first the molecular gas where IRAS 18544+0112 was formed, thus\nexplaining their different evolutionary stages. Kobayashi et al. (2008) proposed a similar\nscenario for the star forming region in Digel's Cloud 2 , where an expanding shell has\nperturbed different parts of a molecular cloud during its evolution, producing different star\ngenerations.\nTo test the proposed scenario we estimate the age of the HII region at the moment it\nreached the location of each IRAS source. Using a simple model described by Dyson &\nWilliams (1980) we calculated the age of the HII region at a given radius R as\n4 Rs\nt(R) =\n7 cs\n\n\"\u0012\n\nR\nRs\n\n\u00137/4\n\n\u22121\n\n#\n\nwhere cs is the sound velocity in the ionized gas (cs =10 km s\u22121 ) and Rs is the radius\nof the Str\u00f6mgren sphere, given by Rs = (3Nuv /4\u03c0n20 \u03b1B )1/3 , where \u03b1B =2.6 \u00d710\u221213 cm3\ns\u22121 is the hydrogen recombination coefficient to all levels above the ground level. Nuv is\nthe total number of ionizing photons per unit of time emitted by the stars, and n0 is the\noriginal ambient density.\nThe number Nuv of UV ionizing photons needed to keep an HII region ionized is given\n0.1\n2\nby (see, e.g. Chaisson 1976) Nuv = 0.76 \u00d71047 T4\u22120.45 \u03bdGHz\nS\u03bd Dkpc\n, where T4 is the electron\n\ntemperature in units of 104 K, Dkpc the distance in kpc, \u03bdGHz the frequency in GHz, and\nS\u03bd the measured total flux density in Jy. To calculate the radio flux density and in order to\novercome the problem of superposition of the thermal radiation of the HII region and the\nnon-thermal flux of the SNR that occurs in the western half of the HII region, we assumed\nthe HII region to consist of two identical halves; we therefore integrated the flux density\nover the \"free\" eastern half of the ionized sphere and assumed that for the complete region\nit is just twice this value. Using the 1.4 GHz VLA image we estimated S1.4GHz \u223c 3 Jy,\nwhich agrees with previous estimations, S4.85GHz = 2.6 Jy (Kuchar & Clark 1997), and\n\n\f12\n\nM. E. Ortega et al.: A multiwavelength study towards IRAS 18544+0112\n\nFig. 9. Left: Two-color Spitzer image of the HII region G034.8\u22120.7 (8 \u03bcm = green and 24 \u03bcm =\nred). The exterior and interior circles correspond to the size of the HII region at the moment it\nreached the location of IRAS 18542+0114 and IRAS 18544+0112 , respectively. Right: Tomographic\nmap obtained between 74 and 324 MHz (50 \u2032\u2032 resolution). Black regions correspond to negative\nradio spectral indices, while greys and white indicate regions with a positive spectrum. Overlapped\nthere is 1.4 HGz radio continuum emission contour traced at 40 K. The circle is the exterior one\nfrom the left pannel.\n\nS2.7GHz = 2.8 Jy (Paladini et al. 2003) for a spectral index \u03b1 = \u22120.1 (S\u03bd \u223c \u03bd \u03b1 ) typical\nfor the optically thin regime of HII regions. For an HII region with T= 104 K placed at a\ndistance of 3 kpc, the total amount of ionizing photons needed to keep the source ionized\nturns out to be about Nuv = 1.7 \u00d7 1048 ph s\u22121 . Based on the ionizing fluxes for massive\nstars given by Schaerer & de Koter (1997), we infer that the ionizing star cannot be later\nthan O9.5 V. However, this is only a coarse limit. The exciting star is probably earlier than\nO9.5 since if the observed infrared emission originates in dust heated by stellar radiation,\npart of the UV radiation is dissipated in this way.\nTo estimate the dynamical age of the HII region it is important to determine the center\nfrom which the ionized gas is expanding. Based on the infrared and radio continuum emission distribution we identify an almost circular morphology for the HII region G034.8\u22120.7.\nFigure 9 (left) shows that infrared emission at 8 \u03bcm (green) clearly delineates the southeastern border of the HII region, while the border where IRAS 18542+0114 is located is\ndiffuse and fainter. To better delineate this border we inspected a tomographic map traced\nbetween 74 and 324 MHz towards W44 (see Fig. 9,(right)). In a radio study of SNR W44,\nCastelletti et al. (2007) found a curious spectral index inversion on the southeastern limb\nof W44 that appears as an indentation in the SNR boundary. There, the spectrum changes\nfrom a negative value corresponding to the SNR synchrotron radiation (spectral index\n\u03b1 \u223c \u22120.6) to \u03b1 \u2265 0. In Fig. 9 (right) darker regions correspond to a negative spectral\nindex. We propose that the spectral inversion must be the result of free-free absorption\nproduced by thermal ionized gas naturally explained by the presence of the HII region\nG034.8\u22120.7 located between us and the SNR. In this way, we can delineate the north-\n\n\fM. E. Ortega et al.: A multiwavelength study towards IRAS 18544+0112\n\n13\n\nwestern border of the HII region where IRAS 18542+0114 is located, thus determining the\nprobable center of the expanding HII region.\nBy\n\nadopting the\n\nradii R1 =3pc\n\nand R2 =4pc\n\nfor\n\nIRAS\n\n18544+0112\n\nand\n\n3\n\nIRAS 18542+0114, respectively, an ambient density in the region of less than \u223c 10 cm\u22123\nand as the exciting agent for the HII region an O9.5 star, we derived dynamical ages of\nabout 0.6 \u00d7106 and 1.2 \u00d7106 yr for the HII region at the position of IRAS 18544+0112\nand IRAS 18542+0114, respectively. An age difference of \u223c 6 \u00d7105 yr is compatible with\nthe observed different evolutive stages of both IR sources.\nThe remaining question is whether the expansion of the SNR W44 had some influence\nin the processes observed in this molecular complex. Based on the age of the associated\npulsar, Wolszczan et al. (1991) estimated an age of about 2 \u00d7 104 yr for the SNR W44.\nThus, the possibility that the SNR W44 has triggered the star formation in this region\nseems unlikely.\n\n8. Summary\nWe present a molecular and infrared analysis of the IR source IRAS 18544+0112. The main\nresults can be summarized as follows:\n(a) We find 12 CO J=3\u20132 self-absorbed profiles, which are typical of star forming regions.\nHowever, we do not detect any evidence of an outflow activity in IRAS 18544+0112 either\nin the molecular lines or in the infrared emission distribution.\n(b) The analysis of the\n\n12\n\nCO J=3\u20132 line suggests the presence of expanding molecular\n\ngas in the region.\n(c) Based on its morphology, infrared and molecular parameters, and the non detection\nof ionized gas, we suggest that IRAS 18544+0112 is an evolved high mass protostellar\nobject which has not yet reached the ultracompact HII region stage.\n(d) From a near-infrared photometric analysis of the point sources observed towards\nIRAS 18544+0112 we propose that 2MASS 18565878+0116233 source (source three in the\ntext) is the MYSO candidate most likely associated with IRAS 18544+0112.\n(e) Based on the observational evidence that the HII region G034.8\u22120.7 is perturbing\nthe neighboring molecular clouds we suggest that it has triggered at least two star forming\nregions, IRAS 18542+0114 and IRAS 18544+0112 , during its expansion.\nAcknowledgements.
