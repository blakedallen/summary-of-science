I NTRODUCTION\nIn the last years, the adoption of active systems has\nincreased in many fields of computer science. Active systems must automatically react to achieve or maintain their\nrequirements, depending on the information collected from\nthe surrounding environment. Examples of such systems are\nactive databases [1], active sensor networks [2], and smart\ngrids [3]. For instance, smart grids may need to adjust the\nworkload on the appliances (e.g., fridge, oven) available in\na building to optimize energy consumption and costs.\nEvent-driven architectures [4] are a common architectural\nparadigm to design active systems. This paradigm is based\non the idea that the actions the system will perform are\ngenerated as a reaction to the events occurred inside and\noutside the system. In many cases, providing such active\n\nfunctionality requires to materialize the occurrence of other\nrelevant events, according to a set of inference rules. These\nrules are generally defined by domain experts, and are\nformalized by designers. Domain experts must provide the\nset of basic events to be collected, which serve as input to\nthe rules, their inter-relationships, and the parameters of the\nevents for determining a new event materialization.\nHowever, the collection of data is often hampered by\nuncertainty and vagueness that can arise from the imprecision of the monitoring infrastructure, unreliable data sources,\nand networks. The inference rules that are used to produce\na reaction are also imprecise. They often depend on the\nevaluation of untimed or temporal properties that are vague,\nsince they are expressed by humans, and, for this reason,\ncannot be assessed in a crisp way. For example, a smart\ngrid must satisfy the following property: \"all appliances\nmust be available almost always\". This rule is vague since\nthe concept of availability cannot be precisely assessed,\nbecause it may depend on the perception of the customers.\nThe temporal period (\"almost always\"), during which the\navailability property must be satisfied, is vague as well. For\nthese reasons, it becomes fundamental to identify a suitable\nformalism to represent vague properties as suitable untimed\nor temporal formulae.\nFuzzy logic has been conceived as a mathematical abstraction to express vagueness in the satisfaction of formulae. While the propositional fuzzy logic has been deeply\ninvestigated, the fuzzy version of the temporal modalities\nhas been often neglected. Few attempts [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]\nto manage time have been made, but all these approaches\njust focus on the uncertainty of the information and do not\ntake into account the truth degree of temporal expressions.\nThe semantics of existing fuzzy temporal operators is based\non the idea of replacing classical connectives or propositions\nwith their fuzzy counterparts. Existing fuzzy languages do\nnot allow us to represent additional temporal properties, such\nas \"almost always\", \"soon\". This kind of modalities may be\nuseful when we need to specify situations when a formula\nis slightly satisfied, since an event happens a little bit later\nthan expected, when a property is always satisfied except\nfor a small set of time instants, or a property is maintained\nfor a time interval which is slightly smaller than the one\n\n\frequested.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a temporal\nframework, FTL (Fuzzy-time Temporal Logic), to express\nvagueness on time. This framework formally defines a set\nof fuzzy temporal modalities, which can be customized\nby choosing a specific semantics for the connectives. The\nsemantics of the language is sound, and the introduced\nmodalities respect a set of expected mutual relations. We\nalso prove that under the assumption that all events are crisp,\nFTL reduces to LTL. Finally, for some of the possible fuzzy\ninterpretations of the connectives, we identify an adequate\nset of temporal operators, from which it is possible to derive\nall the others.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses\nsome related work. Section III provides some background\nknowledge about fuzzy logic and points out its differences w.r.t. probability theory. Section IV presents the FTL\nframework, by illustrating some interesting properties of the\noperators it introduces. Section V identifies an adequate\nset of connectives for some classical interpretations of the\nconnectives. Note that proofs of propositions are given in a\nsketch form, and minor details are left to the reader. Section\nVI provides some example of possible FTL specifications\nin the context of smart grids, and Section VII concludes the\npaper.\nII. R ELATED W ORK\nIn computer science, fuzzy logic has been mainly used\nto represent the uncertainty due to the unpredictability of\nthe environment or the imprecision of the measurements.\nMany attempts [6], [5] have been made to use fuzzy logic\nto monitor the satisfaction of temporal properties of the\nsystem and/or the environment. For example, Lamine and\nKabanza [6] add, for each classic temporal operator (e.g.,\nalways, eventually, until, etc.), a corresponding fuzzy temporal one. This operator keeps the same semantics of its\ncrisp counterpart, with the only difference that the Boolean\nconnectives (not, and, or) are replaced with the corresponding operations in the Zadeh interpretation (see operations\nassociated respectively with negation, t-norm and t-conorm\nin Table II). The authors evaluate a fuzzy proposition over a\nhistory (i.e., a sequence of states) and associate a weight with\nthe evaluation made at each state. The weights and the extent\nto which the history is needed to evaluate a proposition\nare defined empirically, depending on the application and\nthe properties expressed by the proposition itself. Similarly,\nThiele and Kalenka [5] define a fuzzy \"interpretation\" of the\ntraditional temporal operators. They also introduce proper\nfuzzy temporal operators to represent the short or long\ntime distance in which a specific property must be satisfied\n(in the future or in the past). Despite the aforementioned\napproaches are a first step towards the fuzzyfication of time,\nthey do not associate a specific fuzzy semantics with the\ntemporal modalities. Instead, temporal modalities have a\n\nfuzzy semantics only depending on the interpretation given\nto their (sub-)argument, which is an untimed fuzzy formula.\nOther works [7], [8], [9] have a slightly different objective.\nThey use fuzzy temporal logic to express uncertainty about\nthe time in which some specific events may occur and the\ntemporal relationships among events and states. Dutta [7]\ndefines the occurrence of an event as the possibility of\nits occurrence in any time interval. This way the authors\ncan evaluate a set of temporal relations between a pair\nof events: if an event precedes/follows another one, the\ndegree an event overlaps another one, or whether an event\nimmediately follows another one. Similarly, Dubois and\nPrade [8] represent dates as a possibility distribution. Hence,\nit is possible to express different situations: whether a date\nis precisely known or not (i.e., it is within an interval),\nwhether a date is fuzzily known (i.e., the interval boundaries\nthat contain the date are not clearly known), or whether\na date is attached to an event that may not occur. From\nthis representation the authors use fuzzy sets to represent\ntime points that are possibly/necessarily after or before a\ndate, and use fuzzy comparators to express relations between\ntime instants. Finally, Moon et al. [9] do not consider\nuncertainty on the time instants, but fuzzify temporal events\nand states and define an order relation among events and\nstates, represented as a directed graph.\nIn requirements engineering fuzzy logic has been adopted\nto perform tradeoff analysis [10] among conflicting functional requirements. In particular, aggregation functions are\nused to combine correlated requirements into high-level\nones. Fuzzy logic has been also exploited to express uncertain requirements [11], [12], [13]. Liu et al. [11] introduce a\nmethodology to elicit non-functional requirements through\nfuzzy membership functions that allow one to represent\nthe uncertainty about the human perception. RELAX [12]\nis a notation to express uncertain requirements, whose\nassessment is affected by the imprecision of measurement.\nFinally, FLAGS [13] extends traditional LTL by adding\nnew operators to represent transient/small violations in the\ntemporal domain. Its main purpose is providing a notion of\nsatisfaction level of requirements in the temporal domain.\nIn particular, the authors use this approach to tolerate small\ndeviations of the satisfaction of the requirements during or\nwithin a temporal interval. Despite the purpose of FLAGS\nis similar to our approach, the syntax and the semantics of\nthe FLAGS language are not formally described, and the\nrelations among temporal operators are not even provided.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nThis section provides a general definition of fuzzy logic,\nand points out the differences between a fuzzy and a probabilistic approach for the evaluation of temporal properties.\nFinally, the section introduces the formalism proposed in [6]\nand discusses its limitations.\n\n\fA. General formalization of fuzzy logic\nThe term \"fuzzy\" has been explicitly used for the first\ntime in Zadeh's seminal work [14] about fuzzy sets, where\nhe presented the theory of classes with unsharp boundaries.\nIn this work, the logical formalism of fuzzy sets shares the\nsame syntax of Propositional Logic (PL), but its formulae\nmay have a truth value comprised between 0 and 1. Conjunction and disjunction are interpreted as min and max\noperations, respectively.\nAs Zadeh pointed out [15], two main directions in fuzzy\nlogic have to be distinguished. In a broad sense, fuzzy logic\nhas been used to support fuzzy control and to express the\nvagueness of natural languages, without demonstrating its\nformal properties. In a narrow sense, \"fuzzy logic is a logical\nsystem which is an extension of multivalued logic and is\nintended to serve as a logic of approximate reasoning\". In\nthis paper, we use the term \"fuzzy logic\" to refer both to\nthe Zadeh Logic [14] (which in computer science it is often\ncalled \"Fuzzy Logic\") and each continuous t-norm fuzzy\nlogic [16]. Despite the Zadeh Logic has been heavily applied\nin soft computing, it has no strong logical characterization.\nInstead, for t-norm fuzzy logics, it is often possible to\nprovide an axiomatization and some completeness results.\nWe conceive a fuzzy logic as a many-valued logic [17],\nwhose formulae may have a truth value comprised between\n0 and 1 and the semantics of the connectives satisfies some\nmonotonicity laws. The semantics of a fuzzy logic must\nalso be coherent with PL, which means that fuzzy logic\nand PL must share the same syntax, fuzzy logic must\nreduce to PL when all predicates assume value 0 or 1,\nand conjunction and disjunction must be commutative and\nassociative connectives. The semantics of the conjunction\n(\u2227), disjunction (\u2228), negation (\u00ac), and implication (\u21d2), is\ninferred by considering respectively a continuous t-norm\n(\u2297) [18], its associated t-conorm (\u2295), a negation function\n( ), and an implication function (5). In the case of a tnorm fuzzy logic, the negation is the pseudo-complement\n(i.e., \u03b1 = max{\u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1] | \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b2 = 0}), while the\nimplication function becomes the residuum of the t-norm\n(i.e., \u03b1 5 \u03b2 = max{\u03b3 \u2208 [0, 1] | \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b3 \u2264 \u03b3}). In the rest of\nthe paper we will refer to these functions as the interpretation\nof connectives. Note also that the family of (continuous) tnorm fuzzy logics is infinite, as demonstrated by the infinite\nclass of Dubois-Prade [19] and the Yager [20] t-norms and\nt-conorms.\nTable I summarizes some useful properties of the connectives of a fuzzy logic, while Table II provides the\ninterpretation of these connectives for the Zadeh Logic and\nthree other well-known t-norm fuzzy logics.\nOnce identified an interpretation of the connectives, the\nevaluation of a (fuzzy) formula can be represented as a\nfunction vi from the set of well-formed formulae to [0, 1],\nwhich extends the interpretation i : AP \u2192 [0, 1] used to\n\nevaluate an atomic proposition in AP .\nThe following proposition describes some well-known\nproperties of t-norms and t-conorms.\nProposition 1. Let \u2297 be a t-norm and \u2295 be a t-conorm,\n\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1], and d+ , d\u00d7 : [0, 1]2 \u2192 {0, 1} be the drastic\nsum and the drastic product defined respectively by:\nd+ (\u03b1, \u03b2) = 1 \u21d4 \u03b1 + \u03b2 > 0,\nd\u00d7 (\u03b1, \u03b2) = 1 \u21d4 \u03b1 * \u03b2 = 1.\nThen\nmax{\u03b1, \u03b2} \u2264 \u03b1 \u2295 \u03b2 \u2264 d+ (\u03b1, \u03b2),\n\nd\u00d7 (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2264 \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b2 \u2264 min{\u03b1, \u03b2}.\n\nFor a continuous t-norm it is possible to define two\nconnectives called lattice (or weak) conjunction (\u2227w ), and\nlattice disjunction (\u2228w ). The semantics of these connectives\nis given by:\np \u2227w q = p \u2227 (p \u21d2 q),\n\np \u2228w q = ((p \u21d2 q) \u21d2 q) \u2227w ((q \u21d2 p) \u21d2 p).\n\nNevertheless, they reduce respectively to the max and min\noperations, as stated in the following well-known proposition.\nProposition 2. Let p\u03b1 , p\u03b2 \u2208 AP such that i(p\u03b1 ) = \u03b1, and\ni(p\u03b2 ) = \u03b2, then, for each continuous t-norm:\nvi (p\u03b1 \u2227w p\u03b2 ) = max{\u03b1, \u03b2},\nv i (p\u03b1 \u2228w p\u03b2 ) = min{\u03b1, \u03b2}.\nB. Fuzzy Logic and Probability\nFuzzy logic and probability have been usually conceived\nas similar disciplines. However, the nature of fuzzy logic\nand probability are totally different both on the ontological\nand epistemological level. These disciplines deal with two\ndifferent topics. Probability focuses on observable events\nwhose occurrence is uncertain, while fuzzy logic deals with\nvague events that cannot be clearly assessed.\nFor example, the statement \"tomorrow there will be a\npower outage\" is uncertain, since it is not possible to know\nthe truth value of the formula. However, by applying the\nprobability theory (e.g., by analyzing the frequency of power\noutages during the last month), it is possible to state that, for\nexample, the probability that the aforementioned statement\nwill be true is 3.8%. Still, when a direct observation can be\nperformed (i.e., tomorrow), it is possible to assess whether\nan outage took place or not and, indeed, the probability value\ncan collapse either to 0 or 1.\nInstead, the statement \"tomorrow the number of power\noutages will be low\" is not tractable from a probabilistic\npoint of view, because the nature of the event itself is not\nclearly measurable, since the concept of \"low\" has not been\ndefined in a observable way. In this case, we are not facing\nthe problem of uncertainty of an event, but the vagueness\nof its definition. Indeed, assigning the truth degree of 0.038\n\n\fTable I\nP ROPERTIES OF THE INTERPRETATIONS OF CONNECTIVES .\nboundary value\n0=1\n1=0\n\nnegation\n\ncommutativity\n\nassociativity\n\n-\n\n-\n\nmonotonicity\n\u03b1\u2264\u03b2\u21d2\n\n\u03b1\u2265\n\n\u03b2\n\nt-norm\n\n\u03b1\u22970=0\n\u03b1\u22971=\u03b1\n\nyes\n\nyes\n\n\u03b2 \u2265\u03b3 \u21d2\u03b1\u2297\u03b2 \u2265\u03b1\u2297\u03b3\n\u03b1\u2297\u03b2 \u2264\u03b1\n\nt-conorm\n\n\u03b1\u22950=\u03b1\n\u03b1\u22951=1\n\nyes\n\nyes\n\n\u03b2 \u2265\u03b3 \u21d2\u03b1\u2295\u03b2 \u2265\u03b1\u2295\u03b3\n\u03b1\u2295\u03b2 \u2265\u03b1\n\nimplication\n\n15\u03b2 =\u03b2\n05\u03b2 =\u03b151=1\n\u03b150= \u03b1\n\nno\n\nno\n\n\u03b1\u2264\u03b2 \u21d2\u03b15\u03b3 \u2265\u03b25\u03b3\n\u03b2 \u2264\u03b3 \u21d2\u03b15\u03b2 \u2264\u03b15\u03b3\n\u03b1 5 \u03b2 \u2265 max{ \u03b1, \u03b2}\n\nTable II\nS OME INTERPRETATION FOR CONNECTIVES .\nZadeh [14]\n\u03b1\n\n1\u2212\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\u2297\u03b2\n\nmin{\u03b1, \u03b2}\n\n\u03b1\u2295\u03b2\n\nmax{\u03b1, \u03b2}\n\nG\u00f6del-Dummett [21]\n\u001a\n1, \u03b1 = 0\n0, \u03b1 > 0\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz [17]\n\nmin{\u03b1, \u03b2}\n\nmax{\u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2212 1, 0}\n\nmax{\u03b1, \u03b2}\n\nmin{\u03b1 + \u03b2, 1}\n\n\u001a\n\u03b15\u03b2\n\nmax{1 \u2212 \u03b1, \u03b2}\n\n1,\n\u03b2,\n\n\u03b1\u2264\u03b2\n\u03b1>\u03b2\n\nto the aforementioned statement means that tomorrow the\nsmart grid will face a \"high number of outages\".

Fuzzy Linear-time Temporal Logic\nThis section briefly describes FLTL (Fuzzy Linear-time\nTemporal Logic) [6], which is an extension of Zadeh Logic\nwith temporal operators. FLTL has the same syntax of LTL.\nIn particular, let \u03a6 be the set of well formed formulae and\nAP the set of propositional letters, then \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6 if and only\nif\n\u03c6 := p | \u00ac\u03c6 | \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c6 | X\u03c6 | G\u03c6 | \u03c6U\u03c6,\nwhere p \u2208 AP . The semantics of a formula \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6 is defined\nw.r.t. a linear time structure \u03c0\u03c3 = (S, w0 , w, L), where S is\na set of states, w0 is the initial state, w \u2208 w0 S \u03c9 is an infinite\npath, and L : S \u2192 [0, 1]AP is a fuzzy labeling function. The\nevaluation v(\u03c6, wi ) of a formula \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6 along the path w\nfrom the i-th instant is a real number in [0, 1] recursively\ndefined by:\nv(p, wi ) = L(wi )(p),\nv(\u00ac\u03c6, wi ) = 1 \u2212 v(\u03c6, wi ),\nv(\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8, wi ) = min{v(\u03c6, wi ), v(\u03c8, wi )},\nv(X\u03c6, wi ) = v(\u03c6, wi+1 ),\nv(G\u03c6, wi ) = min{v(\u03c6, wi ), v(G\u03c6, wi+1 )},\nv(\u03c6U\u03c8, wi ) =\nmax{v(\u03c8, wi ), min{v(\u03c6, wi ), v(\u03c6U\u03c8, wi+1 )}}.\n\nProduct [22]\n\u001a\n\n1\u2212\u03b1\n\n\u03b1=0\n\u03b1>0\n\u03b1*\u03b2\n\n\u03b1+\u03b2\u2212\u03b1*\u03b2\n\u001a\n\nmin{1 \u2212 \u03b1 + \u03b2, 1}\n\n1,\n0,\n\n1,\n\u03b2/\u03b1,\n\n\u03b1\u2264\u03b2\n\u03b1>\u03b2\n\nIt is easy to see that FLTL extends LTL in the sense that\nif for all s \u2208 S and p \u2208 AP is L(s)(p) \u2208 {0, 1}, then\nv(\u03c6, wi ) = 1 \u21d4 wi |= \u03c6.\nNote that FLTL cannot represent the vagueness in the\ntemporal dimension. Fuzzyfication just addresses Boolean\nconnectives and keeps a crisp semantics for the time (always/never). For example, when we evaluate the \"globally\"\n(always) operator, it may not be suitable to consider the\nminimum truth value encountered. For instance, this semantics does not allow us to tolerate transient violations that\ntake place for a few number of times compared to a long\ntime interval. For example, if we want to assess the truth\nof the statement \"this week no power outage happened\",\nwe must consider that even one power outage is enough\nto negatively affect the truth value of this formula, and we\ncannot tolerate a few power outages. Furthermore, even if\nthis semantics allows us to express statements about the\nfuture, such as \"tomorrow power outages will take place\",\nwe cannot express statements, such as \"soon a power outage\nwill happen\".\nFor these reasons, the language we propose in this paper,\nalthough partially inspired by FLTL, introduces a completely\nnew approach to the fuzzifycation of the temporal domain.\n\nIV. FTL: F UZZY- TIME T EMPORAL L OGIC\nIn this section we describe the syntax and semantics of\nFTL, which is our fuzzy-time temporal logic.\n\n\fthen:\n\nA. Syntax\nFTL extends LTL in order to deal with fuzzyness on\ntime. Let AP be a numerable set of atomic propositions,\n\u00ac, \u2227, \u2228, \u21d2 be the (fuzzy) connectives, and O and T be the\nsets of unary and binary (fuzzy) temporal modalities. Then,\n\u03c6 belongs to the set \u03a6 of well-formed FTL formulae (from\nnow on, simply formulae) if it is defined as follows:\n\u03c6 := p | \u00ac \u03c6 | \u03c6 \u223c \u03c6 | O\u03c6 | \u03c6T \u03c6,\nwhere p \u2208 AP , \u223c is a binary connective, O \u2208 O, and\nT \u2208 T . As unary operators we consider X (next), Soon\n(soon), F (eventually), Ft (eventually in the next t instants),\nG (always), Gt (always in the next t instants), AG (almost\nalways), AG t (almost always in the next t instants), Lt (lasts\nt instants), Wt (within t instants), where t \u2208 N. Binary\noperators are U (until), U t (bounded until), AU (almost\nuntil), and AU t (bounded almost until). We admit the use of\nX j (*) as a shorthand for j applications of X . For example,\nX 2 (*) \u2261 X (X (*)). Conventionally we also set X 0 \u03c6 \u2261 \u03c6.\nFrom now on, operators Soon, AG, AG t , Lt , Wt , AU, and\nAU t will be indicated as \"almost\" operators.\nB. Semantics\nThe semantics of a formula \u03c6 is defined w.r.t. a linear time\nstructure (S, s0 , \u03c0, L), where S is the set of states, s0 is the\ninitial state, \u03c0 is an infinite path \u03c0 = s0 s1 * * * \u2208 S \u03c9 , and\nL : S \u2192 [0, 1]AP is the (fuzzy) labeling function that assigns\nto each state an evaluation for each atomic proposition in\nAP . \u03c0 i indicates the suffix of \u03c0, by starting from the i-th\nposition and si is the first state of \u03c0 i . Besides, we adopt an\navoiding function \u03b7 : Z \u2192 [0, 1]. We assume that \u03b7(i) = 1\nfor all i \u2264 0, and n\u03b7 \u2208 N exists such that \u03b7 is strictly\ndecreasing in {0, . . . , n\u03b7 } and \u03b7(n0 ) = 0 for all n0 \u2265 n\u03b7 .\nFunction \u03b7 expresses the penalization assigned to the number\nof events we want to ignore in evaluating the truth degree of\na formula that contains an \"almost\" operator. For example,\nwe interpret the formula \"almost always p\" as \"always p\nexcept for a small number of cases\", and we penalize the\nevaluation of the formula according to the number of avoided\nevents. Hence, the evaluation of a formula that contains\nthe operator AG realizes a tradeoff between the number of\navoided events, and the penalization assigned to this number.\nSince we are dealing with a multi-valued logic, it makes\nno sense to define a crisp satisfiability relation. Instead, to\ndefine the semantics of a formula \u03c6 along a path, we express\na fuzzy satisfiability relation as |= \u2286 S \u03c9 \u00d7 F \u00d7 [0, 1], where\n(\u03c0 |= \u03c6) = \u03bd \u2208 [0, 1] means that the truth degree of \u03c6\nalong \u03c0 is \u03bd. We say that two formulae \u03c6 and \u03c8 in \u03a6 are\nlogically equivalent, in symbols \u03c6 \u2261 \u03c8, if, and only if,\n(\u03c0 |= \u03c6) = (\u03c0 |= \u03c8) for each linear time structure, and for\neach avoiding function.\nThe truth degree of a formula is defined, as usual, recursively on its structure. Let p \u2208 AP and \u03c0 i be a path,\n\n(\u03c0 i\n(\u03c0 i\n(\u03c0 i\n(\u03c0 i\n(\u03c0 i\n\n|= p) = L(si )(p),\n|= \u00ac\u03c6) = (\u03c0 i |= \u03c6),\n|= \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8) = (\u03c0 i |= \u03c6) \u2297 (\u03c0 i |= \u03c8),\n|= \u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8) = (\u03c0 i |= \u03c6) \u2295 (\u03c0 i |= \u03c8),\n|= \u03c6 \u21d2 \u03c8) = (\u03c0 i |= \u03c6) 5 (\u03c0 i |= \u03c8),\n\nwhere p \u2208 AP , i \u2208 N, and , \u2297, \u2295, 5 are the operations,\nbetween real numbers, defining the chosen semantics of the\nconnectives (\u00ac, \u2227, \u2228, \u21d2).\nWe are now able to introduce the semantics of FTL\ntemporal operators.\nNext: Operator \"next\" (X ) has the same semantics of its\ncorresponding LTL operator X:\n(\u03c0 i |= X \u03c6) = (\u03c0 i+1 |= \u03c6).\nSoon: Operator \"soon\" (Soon) extends the semantics of\nthe \"next\" operator, by tolerating at most n\u03b7 time instants\nof delay. In other words, the greater the number of tolerated\ninstants, the greater the penalization will be.\ni+n\u03b7\n\n(\u03c0 i |= Soon \u03c6) =\n\nM\n\n(\u03c0 j |= \u03c6) * \u03b7(j \u2212 i \u2212 1).\n\nj=i+1\n\nProposition 3. From the monotonicity of the t-conorm \u2295\n(see Table I) it naturally follows that\n(\u03c0 i |= X \u03c6) \u2264 (\u03c0 i |= Soon \u03c6).\nEventually: Operator \"eventually\" (F) and its bounded\nversion (Ft ) also maintain the same semantics of their\ncorresponding LTL operator F. Namely,\n(\u03c0 i |= Ft \u03c6) =\n\ni+t\nM\n(\u03c0 j |= \u03c6),\nj=i\n\nM\n(\u03c0 |= F\u03c6) =\n(\u03c0 j |= \u03c6) = lim (\u03c0 i |= Ft \u03c6).\ni\n\nt\u2192+\u221e\n\nj\u2265i\n\nFirst, observe that for Ft the equivalences F0 \u03c6 \u2261 \u03c6 and\nFt \u03c6 \u2261 \u03c6 \u2228 X Ft\u22121 \u03c6 hold, for t \u2265 0. The semantics of F\nrequires a passage to the limit, whose existence is ensured\nby the fact that the sequence (\u03c0 i |= Ft \u03c6)t\u2208N is increasing,\nas the t-conorm \u2295 is monotonic. These facts are summarized\nin the following proposition.\nProposition 4. For all \u03c6 \u2208 F and t \u2264 t0 :\n\n(\u03c0 i |= \u03c6) \u2264 (\u03c0 i |= Ft \u03c6) \u2264 (\u03c0 i |= Ft0 \u03c6) \u2264 (\u03c0 i |= F\u03c6).\n\nWithin: Operator \"within\" (Wt ) is inherently bounded,\nand its semantics is defined by\ni+t+n\u03b7 \u22121\n\n(\u03c0 i |= Wt \u03c6) =\n\nM\nj=i\n\n(\u03c0 j |= \u03c6) * \u03b7(j \u2212 t \u2212 i).\n\nFormula Wt p states that subformula p is supposed to hold\nin at least one of the next t instant or, possibly, in the next\n\n\ft + n\u03b7 . In the last case we apply a penalization for each\ninstant after the t-th.\nProposition 5. The semantics of operator Wt can be expressed by only using operators X and Soon.

For the second property, observe that\n(\u03c0 i |= Fn\u03b7 )\u03c6 \u2265 (\u03c0 i |= Soon \u03c6), and then actually\n(\u03c0 i |= Ft+n\u03b7 \u03c6) \u2265 (\u03c0 i |= Wt \u03c6) \u2265 (\u03c0 i |= Ft \u03c6),\nand applying the squeeze theorem we have the thesis.\nAlways: Operator \"always\" (G) and its bounded version\n(Gt ) extend the semantics of their corresponding LTL operator G. Namely,\n(\u03c0 i |= Gt \u03c6) =\ni\n\n(\u03c0 |= G\u03c6) =\n\ni+t\nO\nj=i\n\nO\nj\u2265i\n\n(\u03c0 j |= \u03c6),\n(\u03c0 j |= \u03c6) = lim (\u03c0 i |= Gt \u03c6).\nt\u2192+\u221e\n\nAs for Ft , observe that for Gt the equivalences G0 \u03c6 \u2261 \u03c6\nand Gt \u03c6 \u2261 \u03c6 \u2227 X Gt\u22121 \u03c6 hold, for t \u2265 0. Similarly to F,\nthe semantics of G also requires a passage to the limit,\nwhose existence is ensured by the fact that the sequence\n(\u03c0 i |= Gt \u03c6)t\u2208N is decreasing, as the t-norm \u2297 is monotonic\n(see Table I). These facts are summarized in the following\nproposition.\n\nAs we will see later, the sequence (\u03c0 i |= AG t \u03c6)t\u2208N is\nnot monotonic. Nevertheless, we can still prove that the\nsemantics of AG is well-defined.\nProposition 9. Given \u03c6 \u2208 F , it is possible to recursively\ndefine n propositional letters p0 , . . . , pn\u22121 , such that\n(\u03c0 i |= AG \u03c6) = max {Gpj * \u03b7(j)} .\nj\u2264n\u03b7 \u22121\n\n\u2200i \u2208 N, (\u03c0 i |= p0 ) = (\u03c0 i |= \u03c6).\nThen, for all 0 < m \u2264 n\u03b7 , we recursively obtain pm from\npm\u22121 in the following way.

Let (ak )k\u2264n be a finite sequence\nof indices such that \u2200k \u2264 n, ak \u2264 t, and \u2200h \u2264 k \u2264 n,\n(\u03c0 ah |= p) \u2264 (\u03c0 ak |= p), then\n(\n)\nO\ni+h\ni\n(\u03c0\n|= p) * \u03b7(j)\n(\u03c0 |= AG t p) = max\nj\u2264n\u03b7\n\nh\u2208\n/ {a1 , . . . , aj }\nh \u2264 n\u03b7\n\n(\n= max\n\n1\u2264j\u2264n\u03b7\n\n)\n\n(\u03c0 i |= Gt p),\n\nO\n\n(\u03c0 i+h |= p) * \u03b7(j) .\n\nh\u2208\n/ {a1 , . . . , aj }\nh \u2264 n\u03b7\n\nmax\n\n0\u2264j\u2264min{t,n\u03b7 \u22121}\n\n{(\u03c0 i |= Gt\u2212j \u03c6) * \u03b7(j)}.\n\nProposition 12. Let \u03c6 \u2208 F and t \u2208 N, then the sequence\n(\u03c0 i |= Lt \u03c6)t\u2208N is decreasing, and its limit is (\u03c0 i |= G\u03c6).\nMoreover, the following inequalities hold:\n(\u03c0 i |= Gt \u03c6) \u2264 (\u03c0 i |= Lt \u03c6) \u2264 (\u03c0 i |= AG t \u03c6).\nProof: The fact that the sequence (\u03c0 i |= Lt \u03c6)t\u2208N is\ndecreasing follows immediately from the definition and from\nProposition 7. Moreover, again from definition\n(\u03c0 i |= Gt \u03c6) \u2264 (\u03c0 i |= Lt \u03c6) \u2264 (\u03c0 i |= Gt\u2212n\u03b7 \u03c6),\nand then passing to the limit the first part follows. The\ninequality (\u03c0 i |= Lt \u03c6) \u2264 (\u03c0 i |= AG t \u03c6) is a direct\nconsequence of Proposition 10.\nUntil: The semantics of operator \"until\" (U) and its\nbounded version (U t ) naturally extends the one assigned to\nthe corresponding LTL operator U, for t > 0:\n(\u03c0 i |= \u03c6 U 0 \u03c8) = (\u03c0 i |= \u03c8),\n(\u03c0 i |= \u03c6 U t \u03c8) = max\n\ni\u2264j\u2264i+t\n\n\u0001\n(\u03c0 j |= \u03c8) \u2297 (\u03c0 i |= Gj\u22121 \u03c6) ,\n\n(\u03c0 i |= \u03c6 U \u03c8) = lim (\u03c0 i |= \u03c6 U t \u03c8),\nt\u2192+\u221e\n\n(2)\nFinding the indices ai requires at most O(n\u03b7 log(t)) comparisons (for example applying the heapsort algorithm), and\nextra O(n\u03b7 ) comparisons are used to evaluate the maximum.\nO(t) applications of \u2297 are needed, observing that the\noperation is associative, and, indeed, the value obtained\nat one step can be used for calculating the value for the\nfollowing step.\nFrom (2), we also have the following corollary.\nCorollary 11. For all \u03c6 \u2208 F and t \u2208 N:\n\n(\u03c0 i |= AG t \u03c6) \u2265 (\u03c0 i |= Gt \u03c6),\ni\n\n(\u03c0 i |= Lt \u03c6) =\n\ni\n\n(\u03c0 |= AG \u03c6) \u2265 (\u03c0 |= G\u03c6).\n\nObserve that in general it is not possible to establish a\npriori which inequality holds between (\u03c0 i |= AG t \u03c6) and\n(\u03c0 i |= AG t0 \u03c6), with t 6= t0 , as this also depends on function\n\u03b7. For example, let us consider a predicate p together with\nan avoiding function \u03b7, whose behaviors are described in\nTable III.\nIf we consider the Zadeh interpretation of connectives,\nthen (\u03c0 0 |= AG 1 p) = 0.1, (\u03c0 0 |= AG 2 p) = 0.3, and (\u03c0 0 |=\n\nAnalogously to AG, the maximum is used to find the best\nmatching between the evaluation of \u03c8 and \u03c6.\nProposition 13. The semantics of operator U is welldefined. Moreover, (\u03c0 i |= \u03c6 U \u03c8) \u2264 (\u03c0 i |= F\u03c8).\nProof: For the first part, it suffices to prove that the\nsequence (\u03c0 i |= \u03c6 U t \u03c8)t\u2208N is increasing. This is obvious\nas, for all t > 0:\n(\u03c0 i |=\u03c6 U t \u03c8)\n\n= max{(\u03c0 i |= \u03c6 U t\u22121 \u03c8), (\u03c0 i |= Gt\u22121 \u03c6 \u2227 X t \u03c8)}.\n\nFor the second part, let p \u2208 AP such that \u2200j \u2265 i, (\u03c0 j |=\np) = 1. Then (\u03c0 i |= \u03c6 U \u03c8) \u2264 (\u03c0 i |= p U \u03c8), and from\nProposition 1, we have\n(\u03c0 i |= \u03c6 U \u03c8) \u2264 (\u03c0 i |= p U \u03c8) = max(\u03c0 j |= \u03c8) \u2264 (\u03c0 i |= F\u03c8).\nj\u2265i\n\nIn particular, for all t \u2208 N, we can write\n\n(\u03c0 i |= \u03c8) = (\u03c0 i |= \u03c6 U 0 \u03c8) \u2264 (\u03c0 i |= \u03c6 U t \u03c8)\n\u2264 (\u03c0 i |= \u03c6 U \u03c8) \u2264 (\u03c0 i |= F\u03c8).\n\n(3)\n\n\fties becomes\ncrucial.\nTo thisAutomata\naim, we propose\n(Fuzzy-time\nTemporal\ndiscrete\nversion\nof Timed\n(TA)FTL\nis used\nto model\nthe system\ncases\nthe a\npossibility\nofframework\nexpressing\nfuzziness\nonvagueness\ntime\nin(Fuzzy-time\ntemporal\nties\nbecomes\ncrucial.\nTothis\nthisaim,\naim,\nwepropose\npropose\nFTL\n(Fuzzy-time\nTemporal\nties\nbecomes\ncrucial.\nTo\nwe\nFTL\nTemporal\nLogic),\ntemporal\nto\nexpress\non\ntime modalistarting\neiaccording\nto\nthe\nvariation\nof we\nthe\nrelevant\nfuzzy\natomic\npropositions.\nA\nties\nbecomes\ncrucial.\nTo\nthis\naim,\npropose\nFTL\n(Fuzzy-time\nTemporal\nLogic),\ntemporal\nframework\nexpress\nvagueness\ntime\nstarting\nLogic),\naa temporal\nframework\ntoto\nexpress\nvagueness\nonon\ntime\nstarting\nei-either of\nfrom\npropositional\nlogicisorinferred\nfuzzy\nlogic.\nIt extends\nthe\nclassical\nFuzzy\ngraph\nzones\nor framework\nregions\nform\nthis\nautomata\nand\na reachaLogic),\na\ntemporal\nto\nexpress\nvagueness\non\ntime\nstarting\neither\nfrom\npropositional\nlogic\nfuzzylogic.\nlogic.ItItextends\nextends\ntheclassical\nclassical\nFuzzy\nther\nfrom\nlogic\nororfuzzy\nthe\nFuzzy\nversion\nofpropositional\nLTL, by adding\ntemporal\nmodalities\nthat allow\nthe designers\nther from\npropositional\nlogic or to\nfuzzy\nlogic. liveness\nIt extendsand\nthe classical\nFuzzy\nbility\nalgorithm\nis\napplied\nassess\nsafety\nproperties.\nWe\nversion\nof\nLTL,\nbyadding\nadding\ntemporal\nmodalities\nthat\nallow\ndesigners\nversion\nof\nLTL,\nby\nthat\nallow\nthe\ndesigners\nto express\nproperties\nsuch temporal\nas\n\"almostmodalities\nalways\" and\n\"soon\".\nInthe\nthis\npaper\nversion\nof\nLTL,\nby\nadding\ntemporal\nmodalities\nthat\nallow\nthe\ndesigners\ndeveloped\na\nprototype\nto\nsupport\nour\ntechnique\nand\nperformed\na\nset\nwe\nformally\nintroduce\nthe\nframework,\ndiscussing\nsome\nof\nthe\npossible\ntoexpress\nexpressproperties\nproperties\nsuch\nas\"almost\n\"almost\nalways\"\nand\"soon\".\n\"soon\".\nthispaper\npaper of\nto\nexpress\nproperties\nsuch\nalways\"\nInInthis\nto\nsuch\nasas\n\"almost\nalways\"\nandand\n\"soon\".\nIn this\npaper\nexperimental\nresults\ntothe\ndemonstrate\nfeasibility.\ndifferent\nlanguages\nobtainable\nfrom it its\nand\ntheir relationship\nwith\nLTL\nwe\nformally\nintroduce\nthe\nframework,\ndiscussing\nsomeofofthe\nthe\npossible\nwe\nformally\nintroduce\nframework,\ndiscussing\nsome\npossible\nwe formally introduce the framework, discussing some of the possible\n\nand\nits languages\nfuzzy\nversion.\ndifferent\nlanguages\nobtainable\nfrom\nand\ntheir\nrelationship\nwithLTL\nLTL\ndifferent\nlanguages\nobtainable\nfrom\nititand\ntheir\nrelationship\n{W\ndifferent\nobtainable\nfrom\nit and\ntheir\nrelationship\nwithwith\nLTL\nt }t\n\nand\nitsfuzzy\nfuzzyversion.\nversion.\nand\nand\nits\nfuzzy\nversion.\n! its\nF !\nF\n{Ftt )}tt\nF(W\nF\n(W\n(F\n(Wttt)t))t)ttt\n(W\n(F\n(Gt )tt))t\n(F\n\nAlmost until: Operator \"almost until\" (AU) and its\nbounded version (AU t ) are obtained by the previous ones,\nby replacing operator Gt with its relaxed version AG t :\n(\u03c0 i |= \u03c6 AU 0 \u03c8) = (\u03c0 i |= \u03c8),\n(\u03c0 i |= \u03c6 AU t \u03c8) = max\n\n\u0001\n(\u03c0 j |= \u03c8) \u2297 (\u03c0 i |= AG j\u22121 \u03c6) ,\n\ni\u2264j\u2264i+t\n\ni\n\ni\n\n(\u03c0 |= \u03c6 AU \u03c8) = lim (\u03c0 |= \u03c6 AU t \u03c8),\nt\u2192+\u221e\n\n(F )\n{G\n}\n(G\n(G\ntt))ttt t\n\n(Gt t)tt tt\n\n1\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n1Many\nIntroduction\nsystems, especially\nG\n\nself-adaptive systems, must be aware of \"how well\"\n\nMany\nespecially\nself-adaptive\nsystems,\nmustreactions\nbe awareaccordingly.\nof \"how well\"\ntheir systems,\nrequirements\nare satisfied\nand apply\nproper\nIn this\ntheir\nare satisfied\nand apply systems,\nproper\nreactions\naccordingly.\nIn\"how\nthiswell\"\nManyrequirements\nsystems, especially\nespecially\nself-adaptive\nsystems,\nmustbe\nbeaware\nawareofof\"how\nwell\"\nMany\nsystems,\nself-adaptive\nmust\n\ntheir requirements\nrequirements\nareComparison\nsatisfiedand\nand\napply\nproperreactions\nreactionsaccordingly.\naccordingly.InInthis\nthis\ntheir\nsatisfied\napply\nproper\nFigure 1.are\namong\noperators.\n\nfor t > 0. Similarly to U, we can state the following.\nProposition 14. The semantics of operator AU is welldefined. Moreover, for all t \u2208 N\n(\u03c0 i |= \u03c8) = (\u03c0 i |= \u03c6 AU 0 \u03c8) \u2264 (\u03c0 i |= \u03c6 U t \u03c8)\ni\n\ni\n\n\u2264 (\u03c0 |= \u03c6 AU t \u03c8) \u2264 (\u03c0 |= \u03c6 AU \u03c8).\n\ni\n\n(4)\n\nProof: As for U, we can observe that for all t > 0,\n\n(\u03c0 |=\u03c6 AU t \u03c8) =\n\nmax{(\u03c0 i |= \u03c6 AU t\u22121 \u03c8), (\u03c0 i |= AG t\u22121 \u03c6 \u2227 X t \u03c8)}.\n\nThe sequence (\u03c0 i |= \u03c6 AU t \u03c8)t\u2208N is increasing and the\nsemantics of AU is well-defined. The latter part follows from\nCorollary 11.\nBefore considering further relations among operators, note\nthat for each class of operators, a different avoiding function\ncan be considered. For example, we may prefer to tolerate\na long delay in evaluating Wt operator, but we accept to\ntolerate only a few number of avoided events in evaluating\nAG t . In this case, we can define two functions, \u03b7W and \u03b7G ,\nsuch that for all i \u2208 N, \u03b7W (i) \u2265 \u03b7G (i). However, we leave\nthis issue for a future investigation.\nAs a final remark, notice that the semantics we have chosen for our operators is arbitrary, and many other variants can\nbe proposed. However, the properties above show that our\nchoice is reasonable. For example, the \"almost \" operators\nare more lax than the traditional ones, since their evaluation\nhas a greater value, exactly as one would expect.\nV. R EDUCTIONS AND EQUIVALENCES\nThis section prove that, under the assumption that all\nevents are crisp, FTL reduces to LTL, and provides a set of\ninteresting relations between the operators of FTL. Finally\nwe also provide some possible adequate set of connectives,\nfrom which it is possible to infer all the others.\nReduction to LTL: We can prove that, in some sense,\nthe semantics of FTL extends LTL, as stated in the following\nproposition and theorem.\nProposition 15. Let p, q \u2208 AP such that for all j \u2265 i,\n(\u03c0 j |= p), (\u03c0 j |= q) \u2208 {0, 1}, then\n(\u03c0 i |= Fp) = 1 \u21d4 \u03c0 i |= Fp,\n\n(\u03c0 i |= Gp) = 1 \u21d4 \u03c0 i |= Gp,\ni\n\ni\n\n(\u03c0 |= p U q) = 1 \u21d4 \u03c0 |= pUq.\n\nProof: It follows, through straightforward calculation,\nby applying the boundary value in Table I.\nTheorem 16. Let for all p \u2208 AP and i \u2208 N, \u03c0 i |= p \u2208\n{0, 1}, and \u03b7(1) = 0. Then FTL reduces to LTL.\nProof: First notice that, by definition, Soon reduces to\nX , Wt to Ft , AG t and Lt to Gt , and AU t to U t . Then, the\nthesis follows by applying an argument similar to the one\nused in the previous proposition.\nGeneral relations: The relations between some of FTL\noperators are shown in Figure 1. Moreover, as shown in the\nfollowing proposition, their values coincide only in a special\ncase.\nProposition 17. Let \u03c6 \u2208 F and i \u2208 N, then (\u03c0 i |= F\u03c6) =\n(\u03c0 i |= G\u03c6) if, and only if, (\u03c0 j |= \u03c6) is constant for all\nj \u2265 i.\nProof: For the first implication, observe that if (\u03c0 j |=\n\u03c6) is constant for all j \u2265 i, then for all j, j 0 \u2265 i, (\u03c0 j |=\n0\nF\u03c6) = (\u03c0 j |= G\u03c6) = (\u03c0 i |= \u03c6). Conversely, suppose\nh, k \u2265 i exist such that (\u03c0 h |= \u03c6) = a < (\u03c0 k |= \u03c6) = b.\nThen from Proposition 1 it follows that:\n(\u03c0 i |= G\u03c6) \u2264 min{\u03c0 j |= \u03c6} \u2264 a < b\nj\u2265i\n\n\u2264 min(\u03c0 j |= \u03c6) \u2264 (\u03c0 i |= F\u03c6).\nj\u2265i\n\nAdequate sets: An adequate set of connectives for a\ngiven logic is a subset of its connectives that is sufficient to\nequivalently express any formula of the logic. For example,\nit is well known that X and U, together with \u2227 and \u00ac, form\nan adequate set of connectives for LTL. Clearly, adequate\nsets also depend on the interpretation of the connectives.\nSo we denote by FTL(Z), FTL(G), FTL(\u0141), and FTL(\u03a0) the\nlogics whose semantics is based on Zadeh, G\u00f6del-Dummett,\n\u0141ukasiewicz, and Product interpretation, respectively.\nBefore finding an adequate sets of connectives for FTL(Z),\nFTL(G), FTL(\u0141), and FTL(\u03a0), we need to introduce the\nextra operators j , for 1 \u2264 j < n\u03b7 , whose semantics is\n(\u03c0 i |=\n\nj\n\n\u03c6) = (\u03c0 i |= \u03c6) * \u03b7(j).\n\nProposition 18. Let \u03c6 \u2208 F , then in FTL(Z) and FTL(\u0141)\nG\u03c6 \u2261 \u00acF\u00ac\u03c6 and F\u03c6 \u2261 \u00acG\u00ac\u03c6.\n\n\fTable IV\nA DEQUATE SETS FOR FTL(Z), FTL(G), FTL(\u0141), AND FTL(\u03a0).\nLogic\nFTL(Z)\nFTL(G)\nFTL(\u0141)\nFTL(\u03a0)\n\nAdequate set\n\u2227, \u00ac, X , U , AU , 1 , . . . , n\u03b7 \u22121\n\u2227, \u21d2, X , U , AU , 1 , . . . , n\u03b7 \u22121\n\u2227, \u21d2, X , F , U , AU , 1 , . . . , n\u03b7 \u22121\n\u2227, \u21d2, \u2228, X , F , G, U , AU\n\nProof: Simply observe that, in the considered logics,\n\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8 \u2261 \u00ac(\u00ac\u03c6 \u2228 \u00ac\u03c8), and \u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8 \u2261 \u00ac(\u00ac\u03c6 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8).\n\nTheorem 19. Let {>, p1 , . . . , pn\u03b7 \u22121 } \u2286 AP , with \u03c0 i |=\n> = 1, \u03c0 i |= pj = \u03b7(j), for all i \u2208 N, and 1 \u2264 j < n\u03b7 .\nThen FTL(Z), FTL(G), FTL(\u0141), and FTL(\u03a0) admit a finite\nset of adequate connectives. Some of the possible adequate\nsets are presented in Table IV.\n\nProof: It mainly follows from propositions 5\u201318, and\nfrom the definition of the operators. Moreover, observe that\nin FTL(Z) and FTL(G), F\u03c6 \u2261 > U \u03c6 and G\u03c6 \u2261 \u03c6 U >.\nWhile F and G are dual in FTL(Z), this does not hold\nin FTL(G), because of the different interpretation of the\nnegation. Observe that in Product Logic, \u2228 cannot be\nexpressed in terms of \u2227, while this is possible in G\u00f6delDummett and \u0141ukasiewicz logics (see [16]). Note that the\nadoption of the adequate sets in Table IV can possibly cause\na super-exponential blow-up of the length of the formulae.\nFor example, formula AG t p, is equivalent in FTL(\u03a0) to a\nt+1\nformula of length O(32 * t) that only contains connectives\n\u2227, \u21d2, and X .\nVI. E XAMPLES OF PROPERTIES AND SPECIFICATIONS\nThis section illustrates how FTL can be adopted in\npractice to formalize a set of properties of a smart grid.\nSmart grids must maximize the availability of appliances and\noptimize the consumption of energy. Metering data regarding\nthe energy consumption are periodically computed and are\nused by the Energy Management System (EMS) to balance\nthe work load of the appliances. In particular, the EMS\nsends proper operational control data to the appliances to\nschedule their tasks and tune their functioning in order to\navoid outages. To this aim, we may need to express some\nstatements about the amount of energy consumed and the\navailability of appliances. Furthermore, we may need to\ntolerate a few number of outages or some cases in which\nthe appliances are temporarily unavailable. Our example\ndefines a set of formulae, under the assumption that the smart\ngrid controls a single appliance (N1 ). However, provided\nformulae can be easily modified to cover the cases when\nmore than one appliance must be controlled.\nThe first property, which may be necessary to evaluate, is\n\"N1 must be available almost always during the day\". Let\n\u03c0 be the path of the daily minutes, and consider a (fuzzy)\npredicate a that measures whether the availability of N1 is\n\nhigh. More precisely, (\u03c0 i |= a) expresses the truth degree of\nproposition \"at the i-th minute of the day, the availability of\nN1 is high\". Availability is, in general, measured as the time\ndifference between the instant when a request is issued and\nthe instant when the appliance is active. This time difference\ncan be estimated in seconds and this makes reasonable the\nchoice of minutes as time granularity. Using this definition\nof availability, we can evaluate predicate a as follows. If Ai\nis the actual time delay of the i-th minute, Mi the mean time\ndelay of the i-th minute of the day computed daily over the\nlast month, and \u03c3i2 the variance, let \u2206i = Ai \u2212 Mi , then\n\u001a\nmin{1, \u03c312 (\u2206i + 23 \u03c3i2 )}, \u2206i \u2265 \u2212 32 \u03c3i2 ;\ni\n(\u03c0i |= a) =\n0,\notherwise.\n2\n\nAs avoiding function we can choose \u03b7(n) = e\u2212(n/20) , if\nn \u2264 20, and 0 otherwise. The evaluation of formula G1440 a\nalong \u03c0 gives a value corresponding, at most, to the worst\ntime difference. Formula AG 1440 a, instead, can be used\nwhen we want to tolerate the cases when the availability\nof N1 is fine, except for at most 20 minutes during the\nday. Indeed, if the availability is below the average for\nno more than 4 minutes, then the evaluation of AG 1440 a\n2\nis, at least, e\u2212(16/20) \u223c 0.53, independently from the\nvalue of the worst minute of the day. Observe that, if we\nconsider the mean delay calculated all over the day, we may\nobtain less expressive results, since in case of one big delay,\nthe evaluation of the daily availability will dramatically\ndecrease.\nWe can also consider the crisp propositions d and c. The\nformer is satisfied if new metering data are available, while\nthe latter is satisfied if an operational control signal is sent by\nthe EMS to N1 . If we want to evaluate the property \"as soon\nas new metering data are available, a new operational control\ndata must be sent by the EMS to N1 \", we can formalize it\nas d \u21d2 W1 c (or by d \u21d2 Soon c, if we do not evaluate the\nformula from the first second), which allows to tolerate small\ndelays in the trasmission of operational control data. Instead,\nwe cannot tolerate small delays by using LTL, since the same\nproposition would be expressed as d \u21d2 c or d \u21d2 Xc.\nFurthermore, let s be a crisp proposition whose evaluation\nis 0, if the appliance is disconnected. Hence, if p is the\n(fuzzy) proposition \"the energy consumption is moderate\",\nthen \u03c0 |= s U 1440 p is the truth value of proposition \"there\nis no outage in the day until the energy consumption is\nmoderate\". In case we decide to relax our requirement to\n\"the outages of the day are negligible until the energy\nconsumption is moderate\", we can express this requirement\nas s AU 1440 p. The choice of operator AU 1440 is suitable\nbecause AG 1440 s allows us to neglect a few number of\noutages of the appliance during the day.\nFinally, the choice of a specific interpretation for the\nconnectives is highly important to get more precise results,\nalthough all the inequalities we proved are still valid independently of the interpretation. If we consider formula\n\n\fAG 1440 s (\"the daily number of outages is negligible\"), then\nfor the evaluation of formula AG 1440 s\u2228X 1440 AG 1440 s it is\nquite natural to choose the Zadeh or G\u00f6del-Dummett interpretation, instead of the \u0141ukasiewicz interpretation (namely,\nthe truncated sum of their evaluations). As a matter of fact,\nthe predicates of this formula do not \"saturate\", i.e., a long\nsequence of days with many outages cannot be equivalent\nto a day with no outages. Still, the \u0141ukasiewicz interpretation defines a substructural logic in which idempotency of\nentailment fails, and can be useful once we are interested in\nput emphasis on resource-boundedness.\nVII. C ONCLUSIONS\nThis paper introduces FTL, a fuzzy-time temporal logic\nto express vagueness on time. The semantics of the temporal\noperators provided by FTL is highly flexible, since it allows\nus to select a particular interpretation for the connectives,\nwhich best suits the kind of property to be formalized. We\nprove that FTL extends LTL, since, under the assumption\nthat all events are crisp, FTL reduces to LTL. We show\nthat the temporal operators introduced by our logic respect\na set of interesting relations, and we also identify adequate\nsets of connectives. As future work, we are investigating a\nverification technique [23] for checking the truth degree of\nthe FTL formulae on an automata-based model of the system under analysis. This technique modifies the traditional\nreachability analysis, according to the peculiarities of the\nFTL language. Moreover, considering that FTL is particulary\nsuitable for describing requirements of active system, in\nwhich vagueness is often embedded with uncertainty, we\nare planning to investigate the relationship between FTL and\nprobabilistic languages.\nR EFERENCES\n[1] N.
