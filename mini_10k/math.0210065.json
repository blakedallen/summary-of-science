The highest degree of a generator of the product IM is\nbounded above by the sum of the highest degree of a generator of M and the highest\ndegree of a generator of I. One may wonder whether the same relation holds also\nfor the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, that is, whether\nreg(IM) \u2264 reg(M) + reg(I).\n\n(1)\n\nThis is not the case in general. There are examples already with M = I such that\nreg(I 2 ) > 2 reg(I), see Sturmfels [15] and Terai [16]. On the other hand, Chandler\n[5] and Geramita, Gimigliano and Pitteloud [11] have shown that reg(I k ) \u2264 k reg(I)\nholds for ideals with dim R/I \u2264 1. In general one has that reg(I k ) is asymptotically\na linear function of k, see [14, 8]. If one takes I = m and M any graded R-module,\nthen reg(mM) \u2264 reg(M) + 1 holds. So it is natural to ask whether (1) holds\nwhenever I is generated by a regular R-sequence or at least by a sequence of linear\nforms. Unfortunately this is also not the case, even when M is a monomial ideal\nwith a linear resolution and I is generated by a subset of the variables, see Example\n2.1. The purpose of this note is to describe some cases where (1) is nonetheless\nvalid.\nIn Section 1 we recall some generalities about regularity and show in Section 2\nthat (1) is valid for ideals generated by sequences which are almost regular with\nrespect to M and regular with respect to R, see 2.3. For example, any generic\nsequence of homogeneous forms of length \u2264 dim R has these properties. We also\nshow the validity of (1) when the dimension of I is \u2264 1. The argument is similar as\nin the corresponding result of Chandler.\nMore surprising is the fact, proved in Section 3 (Theorem 3.1), that any product\nof ideals of linear forms has a linear resolution. This is obtained as a consequence\nof a description of a primary decomposition of such an ideal, see 3.2.\nIn Section 4 we consider ideals with linear quotients, that is, ideals which can\nbe generated by a minimal system of generators whose successive colon ideals are\ngenerated by linear forms. Examples of such ideals are stable, and squarefree stable\nideals in the sense of Eliahou-Kervaire [10] and Aramova-Herzog-Hibi [1], as well\nas polymatroidal ideals, as noted in [13]. Again it turns out that the property of\nhaving linear quotients is not preserved under taking products or powers. However\nwe show in Section 5 that products of polymatroidal ideals are again polymatroidal,\n1\n\n\f2\n\nALDO CONCA AND J\u00dcRGEN HERZOG\n\nand hence have again linear quotients. This is also implied by the fact that discrete polymatroids are just the integer vectors of an integral polymatroid (see [12,\nTheorem 3.4]) and a theorem on polymatroidal sums [17, Theorem 3].\nLet X be a generic Hankel matrix and let It be the ideal of the minors of size t of\nX. It has been shown in [6] that I2k has a linear resolution for all k. Furthermore,\nit follows from results in [2] and [7] that Itk has a linear resolution for all k and for\nall t. As an application of the concept of ideals with linear quotients we show in\nthe last section that any product It1 * * * Itk of ideals of minors of a generic Hankel\nmatrix has a linear resolution.\nSome of the results of this paper have been conjectured after explicit computations\nperformed by using the computer algebra system CoCoA[4]. We would like to thank\nJ. Abbott, A. Bigatti and M. Caboara for their help and suggestions in doing these\ncomputations.\n1. Generalities\nLet K be a field and let R be a polynomial ring over K. Let M = \u2295i\u2208Z Mi be a\nfinitely generated graded R-module. For every i \u2208 N one defines\nR\ntR\ni (M) = max{j | \u03b2ij (M) 6= 0}\n\nwhere \u03b2ijR (M) is the ijth graded Betti number of M as an R-module, i.e.\n\u03b2ijR (M) = dimK TorR\ni (M, K)j\nR\nand tR\ni (M) = \u2212\u221e if it happens that Tori (M, K) = 0. The Castelnuovo-Mumford\nregularity reg(M) of M is given by\n\nreg(M) = sup{tR\ni (M) \u2212 i : i \u2208 N}\nThe initial degree of a non-zero graded R-module M is the least i such that Mi 6= 0.\nAn R-module M has a linear resolution if its regularity is equal to its initial degree.\nIn other words, M has linear resolution if its minimal generators have all the same\ndegree and the matrices of the minimal free resolution of M over R have entries of\ndegree 1.\nA short exact sequence\n0\u2192N \u2192M \u2192P \u21920\nof graded R-modules yields a long exact sequence of Tor-modules\nR\nR\nR\n* * * \u2192 TorR\ni+1 (P, K) \u2192 Tori (N, K) \u2192 Tori (M, K) \u2192 Tori (P, K) \u2192 * * *\n\nIt follows that\nreg(M) \u2264 max{reg(P ), reg(N)}\nreg(N) \u2264 max{reg(M), reg(P ) + 1}\nreg(P ) \u2264 max{reg(N) \u2212 1, reg(M)}\n\n(2)\n\nLet N be a graded module of finite length.

A homogeneous element x \u2208 R of degree d is\ncalled almost regular on M if the multiplication map x : Mi\u2212d \u2192 Mi is injective for\n0\nall i \u226b 0. Let N = Hm\n(M), i.e. N = {a \u2208 M : mk a = 0 for some k}. Then x is\nalmost regular for M if and only if x is a non-zerodivisor on M/N.\nA sequence x1 , . . . , xm of homogeneous elements of R is called an almost regular\nM-sequence if xi is almost regular on M/(x1 , . . . , xi\u22121 )M for i = 1, . . . , n.\nProposition 1.2. Let M be a graded R-module and x \u2208 R an almost regular element\n0\non M of degree d. Set N = Hm\n(M). Then\nreg(M) = max{reg(M/xM) \u2212 d + 1, s(N)}.\nProof. Set a = reg(M), b = reg(M/xM), c = reg(xM) and s = s(N). We have\nto show that a = max{b \u2212 d + 1, s}. Let W = (0 :M x); then W \u2282 N and\ns(W ) = s(N) = s. We obtain two exact sequences\n0 \u2192 W (\u2212d) \u2192 M(\u2212d) \u2192 xM \u2192 0,\nand\n0 \u2192 xM \u2192 M \u2192 M/xM \u2192 0.\nFrom 1.1 and the first exact sequence we have\n(i) a = max{c \u2212 d, s}.\nFrom the second exact sequence and (2) we have:\n(ii) c \u2264 max{a, b + 1},\n\n(iii) b \u2264 max{a, c \u2212 1}.\n\nBy (i) and (ii) we have a = max{c \u2212 d, s} \u2264 max{a \u2212 d, b + 1 \u2212 d, s} which implies\na \u2264 max{b + 1 \u2212 d, s}. By (iii) and (i) we have b \u2264 max{a, c \u2212 1} = max{c \u2212\nd, s, c \u2212 1} = max{s, c \u2212 1}. Hence max{b + 1 \u2212 d, s} \u2264 max{s + 1 \u2212 d, c \u2212 d, s} =\nmax{c \u2212 d, s} = a.\n\u0003\nGiven a homogeneous ideal I in a polynomial ring R and a graded R-module M,\none defines the saturation (IM)sat of IM as follows:\n(IM)sat = {x \u2208 M : mk x \u2282 IM\n\nfor some k}\n\nand the saturation degree sat(IM) the smallest index j such that IM and (IM)sat\ncoincide from degree j on. In other words, sat(IM) = s((IM)sat /IM) + 1. Note\n0\nthat Hm\n(M/IM) = (IM)sat /IM, and hence sat(IM) is the smallest index j such\n0\nthat Hm\n(M/IM) vanishes from degree j on. As a consequence of 1.2 we have\nCorollary 1.3. Let I \u2282 R be a homogeneous ideal, and let x \u2208 R be a linear form\nwhich is almost regular on R/I. Then reg(I) = max{reg(I + (x)), sat(I)}.\n\n\f4\n\nALDO CONCA AND J\u00dcRGEN HERZOG\n\n2. Regularity of products of ideals and modules\nGiven a graded R-module M and a homogeneous ideal I \u2282 R, the purpose of this\nsection is to discuss cases in which the inequality (1) holds. We mentioned already\nin the introduction that this is not always the case. On the other hand, if one takes\nI = m, where m is the graded maximal ideal of R, then reg(mM) \u2264 reg(M) + 1 and\nhence (1) holds. So it is natural to ask whether (1) holds in case I is generated by\nan R-regular sequence. Unfortunately this is not true, even when I is generated by\nlinear forms, as the following example shows.\nExample 2.1. Let R = K[a, b, c, d], and let J = (a2 b, abc, bcd, cd2 ). The resolution\nof J is\n0 \u2192 R3 (\u22124) \u2192 R4 (\u22123) \u2192 J \u2192 0\nIt follows that reg(J) = 3. If we take I = (b, c) then the resolution of IJ is\n0 \u2192 R(\u22128) \u2192 R3 (\u22126) \u2295 R2 (\u22127) \u2192 R10 (\u22125) \u2295 R(\u22126) \u2192 R8 (\u22124) \u2192 IJ \u2192 0\nThe non-linear minimal syzygy among the generators of IJ is a2 (bcd2 )\u2212d2 (a2 bc) = 0.\nAnyway, reg(IJ) = 5.\nOn the other hand, one has\nTheorem 2.2. Let R be a polynomial ring, and I \u2282 R be an ideal which is generated\nby an almost regular M-sequence x1 , . . . , xm with deg xi = di for i = 1, . . . , m. Then\nreg(IM) \u2264 reg(M) + d1 + d2 + * * * + dm \u2212 m + 1.\n0\nProof. Set Ni = Hm\n(M/(x1 , . . . , xi\u22121 )M). Then by 1.2 we have\n\nreg(M/(x1 , . . . , xi\u22121 )M) = max{reg(M/(x1 , . . . , xi )M) \u2212 di + 1, s(Ni )}\nfor all i = 1, . . . , m. This implies that\nreg(M) = max{reg(M/IM) \u2212 d1 \u2212 d2 \u2212 * * * \u2212 dm + m, s1 , . . . , sm },\nwhere si = s(Ni ) \u2212 d1 \u2212 * * * \u2212 di\u22121 + (i \u2212 1).\nThus we see that\nreg(M/IM) \u2264 reg(M) + d1 + * * * + dm \u2212 m.\nNow\nreg(IM) \u2264 max{reg(M/IM) + 1, reg(M)}\n\u2264 max{reg(M) + d1 + * * * + dm \u2212 m + 1, reg(M)}\n= reg(M) + d1 + * * * + dm \u2212 m + 1.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.3. Suppose that, in addition to the assumptions of 2.2, x1 , . . . , xm is\na regular R-sequence. Then reg(IM) \u2264 reg M + reg(I).\nProof. For the proof we just note that reg(I) = d1 +d2 +* * *+dm \u2212m+1 if x1 , . . . , xm\nis a regular R-sequence.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.4. Let I be an ideal generated by a generic sequence of homogeneous\nforms of length \u2264 dim R. Then reg(IM) \u2264 reg(M) + reg(I).\n\n\fCASTELNUOVO-MUMFORD REGULARITY OF PRODUCTS OF IDEALS\n\n5\n\nProof. A generic sequence is an almost regular sequence on M and a regular sequence\non R.\n\u0003\nThe following result generalizes a theorem of [5] and [11], and is another case in\nwhich the inequality (1) holds\nTheorem 2.5. Let R be a polynomial ring, and let I be a graded ideal with dim R/I \u2264\n1. Then for any finitely generated graded R-module M we have\nreg(IM) \u2264 reg(M) + reg(I).\nProof. The proof follows very much the line of arguments of [5].\nLet x \u2208 R1 be an element which is almost regular on M, M/IM and R/I. We\nfirst show that\nsat(IM) \u2264 reg(M) + reg(I).\n\n(3)\n\nWe set r = reg(M) and t = reg(I). Since (IM)sat /IM and (IM :M x)/IM have\nthe same socle, it suffices to show that if f \u2208 M is homogeneous of degree > r + t\nwith xf \u2208 IM, then f \u2208 IM.\nP\nP\nP\nSuppose that f = i fi mi and xf = i gi mi with gi \u2208 I. Then i (xfi \u2212gi )mi = 0.\nConsider the exact sequence\n\u03b5\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 U \u2212\n\u2192F \u2212\n\u2192M \u2212\u2192 0\nwhere F is free with basis e1 , . . . , ek and \u03b5(ei ) = mi . Then i (xfi \u2212 gi )ei \u2208 U. Let\nP\nu , . . . , ul be a homogeneous system of generators of U, and uj = j aij ei . Then\nP\nP P\nP\nP1\nj aij kj . Note that\ni ( j aij kj )ei , so that xfi \u2212 gi =\nj kj u j =\ni (xfi \u2212 gi )ei =\ndeg kj > r + t + 1 \u2212 deg uj \u2265 t. Hence, kj \u2208 I + (x), since (I + (x))i = Ri for i > t.\nThus kj = xpj + qj with qj \u2208 I. This yields\nP\n\nx(fi \u2212\n\nX\nj\n\naij pj ) = gi +\n\nX\n\naij qj\n\nj\n\nThis equation implies that fi \u2212 j aij pj \u2208 I sat . However, since sat(I) \u2264 reg(I) = t\nP\nP\nand deg(fi \u2212 j aij pj ) > t, it follows that fi \u2212 j aij pj \u2208 I. We conclude that\nP\nP\nf = i (fi \u2212 j aij pj )mi \u2208 IM. This concludes the proof of (3).\nIn order to prove the theorem we assume first that dim M/IM = 0. By (2) we\nhave reg(IM) \u2264 max{reg(M), reg(M/IM) + 1}. Hence it suffices to show that\nreg(M/IM) \u2264 reg(M) + reg(I) \u2212 1. Since reg(M/IM) = s(M/IM) by 1.1, and\nsince s(M/IM) = sat(IM) \u2212 1, this follows from (3).\nNow we assume that dim M/IM = 1. Set N = M/xM. Then Proposition 1.2\nimplies\nP\n\nreg(M/IM) = max{reg(N/IN), sat(IM) \u2212 1}.\n\n(4)\n\nBy 1.1 we also have reg(N/IN) \u2264 max{reg(IN) \u2212 1, reg(N)}, and since N/IN is\n0-dimensional we conclude from the first part of the proof that reg(IN) \u2264 reg(N) +\nreg(I), so that\nreg(N/IN) \u2264 max{reg(N) + reg(I) \u2212 1, reg(N)}\n= reg(N) + reg(I) \u2212 1 \u2264 reg(M) + reg(I) \u2212 1.\n\n\f6\n\nALDO CONCA AND J\u00dcRGEN HERZOG\n\nThe last inequality holds since x is almost regular on M. Thus together with (4) we\nobtain\nreg(M/IM) \u2264 max{reg(M) + reg(I) \u2212 1, sat(IM) \u2212 1}.\n\n(5)\n\nNotice further that\nreg(IM) \u2264 max{reg(M), reg(M/IM) + 1}.\n\n(6)\n\nWe may assume that reg(IM) > reg(M), because otherwise nothing is to prove.\nBut then (6) implies that reg(IM) \u2264 reg(M/IM) + 1. Hence together with (5) we\nget\nreg(IM) \u2264 max{reg(M) + reg(I), sat(IM)}.\nThe desired inequality follows from (3).\n\n\u0003\n\n3. Regularity of products of ideals of linear forms\nThe goal of this section is to prove the following:\nTheorem 3.1. Let R be a polynomial ring and let I1 , I2 , . . . , Id be non-zero ideals\nof R generated by linear forms. Then the product I1 I2 * * * Id has a linear resolution,\ni.e.\nreg(I1 I2 * * * Id ) = d.\nTo prove the theorem we need some preliminary results. Let us fix some notaP\ntion. For a subset A of {1, . . . , d} we will set IA = j\u2208A Ij and denote by |A| the\ncardinality of A. We have:\nLemma 3.2. Let I1 , I2 , . . . , Id be non-zero ideals of R generated by linear forms.\nThen\n|A|\n\nI1 * * * Id = \u2229A IA\n\nis a (possibly redundant) primary decomposition of I1 * * * Id . Here the intersection is\nextended to all the non-empty subsets A of {1, . . . , d}.\nAs a corollary of 3.2 we have:\nCorollary 3.3. Let I1 , I2 , . . . , Id be non-zero ideals of R generated by linear forms.\nThen\nsat(I1 I2 * * * Id ) \u2264 d.\n|A|\n\nProof. of 3.3: Set J = I1 I2 * * * Id . By virtue of 3.2 J sat = \u2229A IA where the intersection is extended to all the non-empty\nsubsets A of {1, . . . , d} such that IA 6= m. It\nP\nsat\nd\nfollows that J = J \u2229 m if Ii = m and J = J sat , otherwise. This implies that\nsat(J) \u2264 d.\n\u0003\nNow we prove 3.2:\n\n\fCASTELNUOVO-MUMFORD REGULARITY OF PRODUCTS OF IDEALS\n\n7\n\n|A|\n\nProof. The ideal IA is obviously IA -primary and hence it suffices to prove that\n|A|\nI1 * * * Id = \u2229A IA . Set J = I1 I2 * * * Id . Let Ji be the product of the Ij with j 6= i.\nBy induction on d, it is enough to show that:\nJ = J1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Jd \u2229 (\n\nd\nX\n\nIi ) d .\n\ni=1\n\nWe prove this equality by induction on d and on dim R. The critical inclusion is \u2287.\nP\nWe may assume that Ii = m (otherwise all the ideals live in a smaller polynomial\nring). It is also harmless to assume that the residue field is infinite. Summing up,\nwhat we have to prove is that if f is an element in J1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Jd of degree \u2265 d then\nf \u2208 J. As Ji is a product of (d \u2212 1) ideals of linear forms, by induction we know\nthat Corollary 3.3 holds for Ji and hence sat(Ji ) \u2264 d \u2212 1 for all i. Let x be a linear\nform which is a non-zerodivisor on R/Jjsat for all the Jj of positive dimension. The\nideals J + (x)/(x) of R/(x) is the product of ideals of linear forms Ii + (x)/(x). So,\narguing modulo x and using induction on dim R, we see that f \u2208 J + (x). Write\nf = h + xf1 , with h \u2208 J. Replacing f with f \u2212 h we may assume from the really\nbeginning that f = xf1 . Since f = xf1 \u2208 Ji and sat(Ji ) \u2264 d \u2212 1, by the choice of\nx we may deduce that f1 itself is in Ji for all i. Now since the sum of the Ii is m\nP\nP\nwe may write x = i xi with xi \u2208 Ii . Then we have f = xf1 = i xi f1 and each\nxi f1 \u2208 Ii Ji = J so that f \u2208 J.\n\u0003\nWe are ready to prove 3.1\nProof. Set J = I1 . . . Id . Since J is generated in degree d our task is to prove that\nreg(J) \u2264 d. We prove it by induction on the dimension of R and on d. The claim\nis trivial if dim R = 1. If dim R/J = 0 then the assertion is also trivial. We may\nhence assume that dim R/J > 0. Let x be a linear form which is a non-zerodivisor\nmodulo J sat . By 1.3 we have that reg(J) = max{reg(J + (x)), sat(J)}. Note that\nreg(J + (x)) = 1 + reg(R/J + (x)). Since reg(R/J + (x)) can be interpreted as the\nregularity of R/J + (x) as an R/(x)-module and the ideal J + (x)/(x) of R/(x) is\na product of ideals of linear forms we have reg(R/J + (x)) = d \u2212 1. It follows that\nreg(I + (x)) = d. Since by 3.3 sat(J) \u2264 d, we are done.\n\u0003\nThe primary decomposition of 3.2 is in general far from being irredundant. For\nexample we have:\nProposition 3.4. Let V1 , . . . , Vd be a family of subspaces of R1 which is linearly\ngeneral, i.e. one has\ndim\n\nX\n\nVi = min{dim R1 ,\n\ni\u2208A\n\nX\n\ndim Vi }.\n\ni\u2208A\n\nfor all the non-empty subsets A of {1, . . . , d}. Assume that\nthe ideal generated by Vi . Then\nI1 * * * Id = I1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Id \u2229 md\nis a primary decomposition of I1 * * * Id .\n\nPd\n\ni=1\n\nVi = R1 . Let Ii be\n\n\f8\n\nALDO CONCA AND J\u00dcRGEN HERZOG\n|A|\n\nProof. We have to show that all the terms IA with 1 < |A| < d in the primary\ndecomposition 3.2 are superfluous. For such an A we distinguish two cases. If\nP\nP\nP\ni\u2208A dim Vi which implies\ni\u2208A Vi =\ni\u2208A dim Vi \u2264 dim R1 then by assumption dim\n|A|\nd\nthat \u2229i\u2208A Ii = \u03a0i\u2208A Ii . Hence IA contains \u2229i=1 Ii and it is therefore superfluous. If\nP\n|A|\ninstead i\u2208A dim Vi > dim R1 , then by assumption IA = m and hence IA \u2283 md . \u0003\nOn the other hand there are cases where all the 2d \u2212 1 ideals appearing in the\nprimary decomposition 3.2 are essential.\n\nExample 3.5. Let R = K[x1 , . . . , xd , y] and consider Ii = (xi , y). Set J = I1 * * * Id .\nIt is not difficult to show that for any subset A \u2286 {1, . . . , d} one has J : m =\n(y) + (xi : i \u2208 A) = IA where m = y |A|\u22121\u03a0i6\u2208A xi . Hence each IA is an associted prime\nof J. Therefore the primary decomposition given in 3.2 is irredundant in this case.\nQuestion 3.6. After 3.1 it is natural to ask whether\nreg(I1 I2 * * * Id ) \u2264 reg(I1 ) + reg(I2 ) + * * * + reg(Id )\nholds for ideals Ii generated by regular sequences. By 2.4, this is true if each Ii is\ngenerated by generic forms.\n4. Modules with linear quotients\nWe say that a graded R-module M has linear quotients if M admits a minimal system of generators m1 , . . . , mk such that for every t = 1, . . . , k one has that\nhm1 , . . . , mt\u22121 i :R mt is an ideal of R generated by linear forms.\nExamples of ideals with linear quotients are strongly stable and squarefree strongly\nstable ideals. Other important classes will be considered in the next sections.\nLemma 4.1. If M has linear quotients then\nreg(M) = max{deg m : m is a minimal generator of M}.\nIn particular, if all generators of M have the same degree, then M has a linear\nresolution over R.\nProof. Let m1 , . . . , mk be as in the definition of module with linear quotients. Set\nMt = hm1 , . . . , mt i. We have an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 Mt\u22121 \u2192 Mt \u2192 Mt /Mt\u22121 \u2192 0\nand Mt /Mt\u22121 is of the form R/I[\u2212 deg(mt )] with I an ideal of R generated by linear\nforms. Since reg(R/I) = 0 it follows that reg(Mt ) \u2264 max{reg(Mt\u22121 ), deg(mt )} and\nhence, by induction, the assertion follows.\n\u0003\nExample 4.2. The ideal J = (a2 b, abc, bcd, cd2 ) of 2.1 has linear quotients, the\nsuccessive colons being:\n(0), (a), (a), (b).\nOn the other hand there are ideals with linear resolution and without linear quotients. The easiest example is the ideal I of 2-minors of the matrix\na b c\nb c d\n\n!\n\n.\n\n\fCASTELNUOVO-MUMFORD REGULARITY OF PRODUCTS OF IDEALS\n\n9\n\nI has a linear resolution but it cannot have linear quotients since it is a prime ideal\nand hence (f ) : (g) = (f ) for each f \u2208 I with deg(f ) = 2.\nNote that for a monomial ideal I to have linear quotients (with respect to the\nmonomial generators) is a purely combinatorial property and hence does not depend\non the characteristic of the base field. On the other hand the minimal free resolution\nof a monomial ideal, and hence its linearity, depends, in general, on the characteristic\nof the base field. This shows that also for monomial ideals to have linear quotients\nis a stronger property than to have a linear resolution. The (famous) example of the\nStanley-Reisner ideal of a triangulation of the real projective plane (see for example\n[3, pag.236]) gives an example of square free monomial ideal that, if the characteristic\nof K is not 2, has a linear resolution and does not have linear quotients.\nWe have seen that the property of having a linear resolution is not preserved by\ntaking products or powers of ideals. The same thing can happen for the property of\nhaving linear quotients:\nExample 4.3. We know from 4.2 that J = (a2 b, abc, bcd, cd2 ) has linear quotients,\nbut as we have seen in 2.1, (b, c)J does not even have a linear resolution. Also, the\nideal I = (a2 b, a2 c, ac2 , bc2 , acd) has linear quotients, the quotients being\n(0),\n\n(b),\n\n(a),\n\n(a),\n\n(c, a).\n\nBut the minimal resolution of I 2 begins with\nR24 (\u22127) \u2295 R(\u22128) \u2192 R15 (\u22126) \u2192 I 2 \u2192 0\nand hence I 2 cannot have linear quotients.\nQuestion 4.4. We have seen that a product of ideals of linear forms has a linear\nresolution. One may ask whether such an ideal has even linear quotients. In the\nnext section we will see that this is the case for products of ideals of variables, see\n5.4. For the general case, we have tested many examples with CoCoA, starting with\ngeneric and with special ideals of linear forms. We have always found ideals with\nlinear quotients.\n5. Polymatroidal ideals\nIn this section we consider a class of monomial ideals with linear quotients which\nis closed under the operation of taking products. The theorems presented here\ncorrespond to analogue theorems in matroid theory.\nLet R = K[x1 , . . . , xn ] be the polynomial ring. For a monomial ideal I \u2282 R we\ndenote by G(I) the unique minimal set of monomial generators, and for a monomial\nu = xa11 . . . xann we set \u03bdi (u) = ai for i = 1, . . . , n.\nDefinition 5.1. A monomial ideal I \u2282 R is said to be polymatroidal if all its\ngenerators have the same degree and if it satisfies the following exchange property:\nfor all u, v \u2208 G(I) and all i with \u03bdi (u) > \u03bdi (v), there exists an integer j with\n\u03bdj (v) > \u03bdj (u) such that xj (u/xi ) \u2208 G(I).\n\n\f10\n\nALDO CONCA AND J\u00dcRGEN HERZOG\n\nThe name is explained by the fact that the elements of G(I) correspond to the\nbasis of a polymatroid, as defined in [17]. If I is a squarefree ideal, then this set\ncorresponds to the basis of a matroid. Hence squarefree polymatroidal ideals are\nalso called matroidal.\nFor the convenience of the reader we reproduce from [13] the proof of the following\nimportant property of polymatroidal ideals.\nProposition 5.2. A polymatroidal ideal I has linear quotients with respect to the\nreverse lexicographical order of the generators.\nProof. Let u \u2208 G(I), and let J be the ideal generated by all v \u2208 G(I) with v > u\n(in the reverse lexicographical order). Then\nJ : u = (v/[v, u] : v \u2208 J).\nThus in order to prove that J : u is generated by monomials of degree 1, we have\nto show that for each v > u there exists xj \u2208 J : u such that xj divides v/[v, u].\nIn fact, let u = xa11 * * * xann and v = xb11 * * * xbnn . Since v > u, there exists an\ninteger i with ai > bi and ak = bk for k = i + 1, . . . , n, and hence an integer\nj with bj > aj such that u\u2032 = xj (u/xi ) \u2208 I. Since j < i, we see that u\u2032 \u2208 J,\nand from the equation xi u\u2032 = xj u we deduce that xj \u2208 J : u. Finally, since\n\u03bdj (v/[u, v]) = bj \u2212 min{bj , aj } = bj \u2212 aj > 0, we have that xj divides v/[v, u].\n\u0003\nThough products of ideals with linear quotients need not to have linear quotients,\nwe nevertheless have\nTheorem 5.3. Let I and J be polymatroidal monomial ideals. Then IJ is polymatroidal.\nProof. Let u and v be two monomials of same degree. We set\n1X\nd(u, v) =\n|\u03bdi (u) \u2212 \u03bdi (v)|.\n2 i\n\nNote that this is an integer. We call d(u, v) the distance between u and v. This function satisfies the usual rules of a distance function. In particular, one has d(u, v) = 0\nif and only if u = v.\nNow let u1 , u \u2208 G(I) and v1 , v \u2208 G(J) and suppose that \u03bdi (u1v1 ) > \u03bdi (uv). Then\nwe may assume that \u03bdi (u1 ) > \u03bdi (u). Hence there exists an integer j1 such that\n\u03bdj1 (u) > \u03bdj1 (u1 ) and u2 = xj1 (u1/xi ) \u2208 G(I). Moreover we have d(u2 , u) < d(u1 , u).\nIf \u03bd(v) \u2265 \u03bd(v1 ) we are done, because then \u03bdj1 (uv) > \u03bdj1 (u1 v1 ), and\nxj1 (u1 v1 /xi ) = u2 v1 \u2208 G(IJ).\nOtherwise \u03bdj1 (v1 ) > \u03bdj1 (v). Hence there exists k1 with \u03bdk1 (v) > \u03bdk1 (v1 ) and such\nthat v2 = xk1 (v1 /xj1 ) \u2208 G(J). Moreover we have d(v2 , v) < d(v1 , v).\nIf \u03bdk1 (u) \u2265 \u03bdk1 (u2 ), then \u03bdk1 (uv) > \u03bdk1 (u2 v1 ) = \u03bdk1 (xj1 (u1 v1 /xi )). Thus if k1 6= i,\nthen \u03bdk1 (uv) > \u03bdk1 (u1 v1 ), and we are done since\nxk1 (u1 v1 /xi ) = u2 v2 \u2208 G(IJ).\nOn the other hand, if k1 = i, then u1 v1 = u2 v2 , and by induction we may assume\nthat the exchange property holds since d(u2 , u) < d(u1 , u) and d(v2 , v) < d(v1 , v).\n\n\fCASTELNUOVO-MUMFORD REGULARITY OF PRODUCTS OF IDEALS\n\n11\n\nOtherwise \u03bdk1 (u2 ) > \u03bdk1 (u). Hence there exists j2 with \u03bdj2 (u) > \u03bdj2 (u2 ) and such\nthat u3 = xj2 (u2 /xk1 ) \u2208 G(I). If \u03bdj2 (v) \u2265 \u03bdj2 (v2 ), then \u03bdj2 (uv) > \u03bdj2 (u2 v2 ) =\n\u03bdj2 (xk1 (u1 v1 /xi )). Thus if j2 6= i, then \u03bdj2 (uv) > \u03bdj2 (u1v1 ), and we are done since\nxj2 (u1 v1 /xi ) = u3 v2 \u2208 IJ.\nOn the other hand, if j2 = i, then u3 v2 = u1 v1 , and by induction on the distance we\nhave the desired exchange property. Otherwise \u03bdj2 (v2 ) > \u03bdj2 (v).\nWe may proceed in this way. Suppose we have already constructed sequences\nxj1 , . . . , xjr , xk1 , * * * , xkr\u22121 , and u1 , . . . , ur+1 \u2208 G(I), v1 , . . . , vr \u2208 G(J) such that\nfor i = 1, . . . , r we have\n(i) xki\u22121 divides ui and xji divides vi ,\n(ii) ui+1 = xji (ui /xki\u22121 ) and vi = xki\u22121 (vi\u22121 /xji\u22121 ),\n(iii) d(ui+1, u) < d(ui , u) and for i 6= r, d(vi+1 , v) < d(vi , v),\n(iv) \u03bdji (u) > \u03bdji (ui ) and \u03bdki (v) > \u03bdki (v).\nHere we have set k0 = i for systematic reasons. Notice that\nur+1 = xjr * * * xj1 (u1 /xi xk1 * * * xkr\u22121 ) and vr = xkr\u22121 * * * xk1 (v1 /xjr\u22121 * * * xj1 ),\nIf \u03bdjr (v) \u2265 \u03bdjr (vr ), then by (iv), \u03bdjr (uv) > \u03bdjr (ur vr ) = \u03bdjr (xkr\u22121 (u1 v1 /xi )). Thus,\nif jr 6= i, then \u03bdjr (uv) > \u03bdjr (u1v1 ), and we are done since\nxjr (u1 v1 /xi ) = ur+1 vr \u2208 G(IJ).\nOn the other hand, if jr = i, and then u1v1 = ur+1 vr and by induction on the\ndistance we have the desired exchange property.\nOtherwise \u03bdjr (vr ) > \u03bdjr (v), and there exists kr with \u03bdkr (v) > \u03bdkr (vr ) and such\nthat vr+1 = xkr (vr /xjr ) \u2208 G(J). Moreover we have d(vr+1 , v) < d(vr , v). Thus the\nnew elements xkr and vr+1 satisfy again the properties (i)-(iv).\nIf \u03bdkr (u) \u2265 \u03bdkr (ur+1 ), then by (iv), \u03bdkr (uv) > \u03bdkr (ur+1 vr ) = \u03bdkr (xjr (u1v1 /xi )).\nThus, if kr 6= i, then \u03bdkr (uv) > \u03bdkr (u1v1 ), and we are done since\nxkr (u1 v1 /xi ) = ur+1 vr+1 \u2208 G(IJ).\nOn the other hand, if kr = i, and then u1 v1 = ur+1 vr+1 and by induction on the\ndistance we have the desired exchange property.\nOtherwise \u03bdkr (ur+1) > \u03bdkr (u), and there exists jr+1 with \u03bdjr (u) > \u03bdjr (ur+1 ) and\nsuch thatur+2 = jr+1 (ur+1 /xkr ) \u2208 G(I). Moreover, d(ur+1, u) < d(ur , u). Thus we\nhave the conditions (i)-(iv) as before but r replaced by r + 1. Condition (iii) implies\nthat the process must terminate. This proves the theorem.\n\u0003\nSince ideals generated by subsets of the variables are obviously polymatroidal,\nTheorem 5.3 implies\nCorollary 5.4. Let I1 , . . . , Id be ideals generated by subsets of the variables. Then\nI = I1 * * * Id has linear quotients.\nLet I and J be matroidal ideals. We let I \u2217 J be the ideal which is generated by\nall monomials uv with u \u2208 G(I) and v \u2208 G(J) such that uv is squarefree. We call\nI \u2217 J the squarefree product of I and J. Analogously to 5.3 we have\nTheorem 5.5. Let I and J be matroidal ideals. Then I \u2217 J is matroidal.\n\n\f12\n\nALDO CONCA AND J\u00dcRGEN HERZOG\n\nThe proof of this theorem similar to that of 5.3. We leave it to the reader.\nAs a particular case of 5.5 one has that the squarefree product of ideals generated\nby variables is matroidal. The corresponding matroid is usually called transversal.\n6. Products of ideals defined by Hankel matrix\nIn this section we use the notion of ideals with linear quotients to show that\nproducts of ideals of minors of a Hankel matrix have a linear resolution.\nLet S be the polynomial ring K[x1 , . . . , xn ] over some field K. Let X be a Hankel\nmatrix with distinct entries x1 , . . . , xn ; this means that X is an a \u00d7 b matrix (xij )\nwith xij = xi+j\u22121 and a + b \u2212 1 = n. Let It be the ideal generated by the minors\nof size t of X. It is known that It does not depend on the size of the matrix X\n(provided, of course, X contains t-minors); it depends only on t and n. For a given\nn it follows that t may vary from 1 to m, where m = [(n + 1)/2] is the integer part\nof (n + 1)/2. It is known that the powers of I2 have a linear resolution, [7]. Blum\n[2, 3.6] has recently shown that if the Rees algebra R(I) of an ideal I is Koszul then\nall the powers of I have linear resolutions. As we know that R(It ) is Koszul [7], we\nhave that Itk has a linear resolution for all t and k. We prove here a stronger result:\nTheorem 6.1. Let X be a generic Hankel matrix. Let t1 , . . . , tp be integers and I\nbe the product of It1 * * * Itp . Then I has a linear resolution.\nWe recall some definitions and results from [6]. Let \u03c4 be the lexicographic term\norder on the monomials of S and >1 the partial order on x1 , . . . , xn defined by\nxj >1 xi if and only if j \u2212 i > 1. A >1 -chain is a monomial xi1 * * * xik such that\nxi1 <1 xi2 <1 * * * <1 xik . Denote by J the initial ideal of I = It1 * * * Itp and by Jk\nthat of Ik . We know that\nJk = (m : m is a >1 -chain of degree k}\nand that\nJ = Jt1 * * * Jtp .\nSince the regularity can only increase by passing to the initial ideal, it suffices to\nshow that\nProposition 6.2. The ideal J has linear quotients.\nBefore proving 6.2 we will describe the generators of J. They have a description in\nterms of the \u03b3-functions associated to the canonical decomposition of any monomial\nof S. Let us recall how. Any monomial m of S has a canonical decomposition\nm = m1 * * * mk as a product of >1 -chains. The monomial m1 is defined to be the\nlargest, with respect to \u03c4 , among all the >1 -chains which divide m. Similarly, m2\nis the largest among all the >1 -chains which divide m/m1 and so on. The shape\nof a monomial m is the sequence of integers s(m) = deg(m1 ), . . . , deg(mk ) where\nm = m1 * * * mk is the canonical decomposition of m. By the very definition, the\nshape of m is a weakly decreasing sequence. For any t and for any sequence of\nintegers s = s1 , . . . , sp one defines\n\u03b3t (s) =\n\np\nX\ni=1\n\nmax(si \u2212 t + 1, 0).\n\n\fCASTELNUOVO-MUMFORD REGULARITY OF PRODUCTS OF IDEALS\n\n13\n\nFurthermore, if m is a monomial then we set:\n\u03b3t (m) = \u03b3t (s(m)).\nExample 6.3. Let m = x21 x32 x23 x35 x6 x7 x38 . Then\nm = (x1 x3 x5 x7 )(x1 x3 x5 x8 )(x2 x5 x8 )(x2 x6 x8 )(x2 )\nis the canonical decomposition of m. Its shape is s(m) = 4, 4, 3, 3, 1 and its \u03b3-values\nare \u03b31 (m) = 15, \u03b32(m) = 10, \u03b33(m) = 6, \u03b34(m) = 2, and\u03b3t (m) = 0 for t > 4.\nGiven the numbers t1 , . . . , tp , let us denote by \u03a9 the set of the monomials m such\nP\nthat deg(m) = pj=1 tj and \u03b3i (m) \u2265 \u03b3i (t1 , . . . , tp ) for every i. In [6] it is proved:\n\nProposition 6.4.\n(1) \u03a9 is a system of generators of J,\n(2) Let m be a monomial with a decomposition (canonical or not) m = n1 * * * nv\nwhere the ni are >1 -chains. Set s = deg(n1 ), . . . , deg(nv ). Then \u03b3i (m) \u2265\n\u03b3i (s) for every i.\nWe introduce a total order \u03c3 on the monomials of S as follows. Let m, n be\nmonomials of S and m = m1 * * * mk and n = n1 * * * nh their canonical decompositions.\nWe set m >\u03c3 n if mj >\u03c4 nj for the first index j such that mj 6= nj . Note that \u03c3 is\ndifferent from \u03c4 ; for instance x21 >\u03c4 x1 x3 but x1 x3 >\u03c3 x21 . Note also that \u03c3 is not a\nterm order. Now we are ready to prove:\nProof. of 6.2: We show that J has linear quotients with respect to the set of generators \u03a9 totally ordered by \u03c3. Let m, n be elements of \u03a9 with m >\u03c3 n. We have\nto show that there exists v \u2208 \u03a9 such that v >\u03c3 n, v/[v, n] divides m/[m, n] and\ndeg[v, n] = deg v \u2212 1. Let m = m1 * * * mk and n = n1 * * * nh be the canonical decompositions and let j be the smallest index such that mj 6= nj . Then mj >\u03c4 nj . Let\nmj = xa1 * * * xar and nj = xb1 * * * xbs . Then there exists a index z such that ai = bi\nfor i = 1, . . . , z \u2212 1 and either az < bz or s = z \u2212 1 and r \u2265 z. In the former case\n(az < bz ) we put v = nxaz /xbz . In the latter case we put v = nxaz /xq where xq is\na variable which appear in nj+1 (note that h > j, since m and n have both degree\nP\nti ). We have to show that v has the desired properties.\nFirst of all, note that v/[v, n] = xaz . This is clear in the first case while in the\nsecond it follows from the fact that q cannot be equal to az otherwise the j-th factor\nin the canonical decomposition of n would be a multiple of xb1 * * * xbz\u22121 xaz .\nSecondly, we claim that xaz divides m/[m, n]. To this end, note that m/[m, n] =\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nm /[m , n ] where m = m/e and n = n/e and e is the common initial part of the\n\u2032\ncanonical decomposition, i.e. e = m1 * * * mj\u22121 xa1 * * * xaz\u22121 . Since xaz appears in m\n\u2032\nand it does not appear in n (otherwise, as above, the j-th factor in the canonical\ndecomposition of n would be a multiple of xb1 * * * xbz\u22121 xaz ), we may conclude that\nxaz divides m/[m, n].\nIt remains to show that v belongs to \u03a9 and that v >\u03c3 n. In the case az < bz\nnote that the v has a decomposition into >1 -chains v = n1 * * * nj\u22121 unj+1 * * * nh with\nu = ni xaz /xbz . This need not to be the canonical decomposition, but its shape is\nequal to that of the canonical decomposition of n and this is enough (by 6.4) to\nconclude that v \u2208 \u03a9. Since by construction u >\u03c4 nj , it is not difficult to check that\n\n\f14\n\nALDO CONCA AND J\u00dcRGEN HERZOG\n\nv >\u03c3 n. In the case s = z \u22121 and r \u2265 z note that the v has a decomposition into >1 chains v = n1 * * * nj\u22121 u1u2 nj+2 * * * nh with u1 = nj xaz and u2 = nj+1 /xaz . As above,\nthis need not to be the canonical decomposition. Its shape has been obtained from\nthe shape of n by the operation \"increase a larger factor and decrease a shorter\".\nThe effect of this operation on the \u03b3-values is clear: the \u03b3-values cannot decrease.\nThis, together with the fact that n is in \u03a9 and 6.4 implies that v is in \u03a9. As in the\nother case, since u1 >\u03c4 nj one can also deduce that v > n.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] A. Aramova, J. Herzog and T. Hibi, Squarefree lexsegment ideals, Math.
