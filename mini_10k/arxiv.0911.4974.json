We use ultra cold atoms from a Bose-Einstein condensate\nin a quantum \u03b4-kicked rotor experiment, and show that an initial state can be approximately recreated even after a period of \"chaotic\" evolution (a number of kicks). As this mechanism only works\nfor a very narrow range of momenta, the net effect is a narrowing of the momentum distribution\nafter the kick sequence.\nPACS numbers: 05.45.Mt,32.80.Lg\n\nHow the irreversibility of macroscopic systems is reconciled with the reversibility of microscopic physical laws\nhas been discussed for over a century. The argument\nwas first made by J. Loschmidt [1] in reaction to Boltzmann's statistical theory of gases. These were the ideas\nwhich helped to develop the theory of dynamical chaos\n[2, 3]. Small perturbations may grow exponentially with\ntime in classical dynamics which makes the motion practically irreversible. This phenomenon is known as classical chaos [4, 5]. In quantum dynamics on the other hand,\nchaos does not exist. Exponential divergence takes place\nonly during the rather short Ehrenfest time [6], and the\nquantum evolution remains stable and reversible in the\npresence of small perturbations.\n\ntion of an effective reversal of chaotic dynamics in the\nquantum regime. The phenomenon observed here can be\nthought of as a multiple beam interferometry, where the\nsharpness of the interference fringes due to constructive\ninterference has been demonstrated [21].\nThe atom optics implementation of the delta-kicked rotor consists of a two-level atom placed in a pulsed standing wave of laser light that is detuned from resonance.\nThe laser field gives rise to a potential that varies sinusoidally with position. The Hamiltonian of the system\ncan be written as\n\nThe delta-kicked rotor is a simple system well suited\nto the study of classical and quantum chaos [7\u201310]. As\na consequence of the quantum-mechanical nature of the\nmotion, dynamical localization has been observed in this\nsystem [11, 12]. It has been central to the study of \"quantum chaos\", receiving significant attention in recent years\n[13, 14]. Casati and co-workers predicted that a quantum particle follows the diffusive dynamics of a classical chaotic system only up to a certain time, known as\nthe quantum break time [15, 16]. The classical diffusion\nceases due to quantum interference, and the momentum\ndistribution settles into an exponential distribution at\nthis point.\n\nwhere f (t) describes the time dependence of the laser\nPN\npulses. For the delta kicked rotor, f (t) = n=1 \u03b4(t\u2212nT ),\nwhere T is the kick period. In this system, it is convenient\nto use the scaled kick period k\u0304 = 8\u03c9R T where \u03c9R =\n2\nh\u0304kL\n/(2m) is the recoil frequency, with kL = 2\u03c0/\u03bb, \u03bb is\nthe wavelength of the laser beam and m the mass of the\natom. A \"quantum resonance\" exists for k\u0304 = 4\u03c0, where\nall kicks add coherently, and quadratic energy growth\nwith the number of kicks is observed. At k\u0304 = 2\u03c0, an\n\"anti-resonance\" is observed, where the effect of each kick\nis effectively negated by the following kick.\nThe potential V0 can be written as h\u0304\u03c6d , where \u03c6d =\n\u03c4p \u03a92 /4\u2206 is the kick strength, \u03c4p is the pulse duration,\nand \u03a9 = d * E/(2h\u0304) is the on-resonance Rabi frequency.\nThe parameter d is the atomic dipole moment induced\nby the laser with electric field E. \u2206 = \u03c9L \u2212 \u03c90 is the\ndetuning from resonance, where \u03c9L is the laser frequency\nand \u03c90 is the resonance frequency.\nFollowing [17] we use a Loschmidt pulse train consisting of N/2 pulses with a scaled period of k\u0304 = 4\u03c0 + \u01eb , a\nwaiting time 6\u03c0 after the last pulse and then N/2 pulses\nwith a period of 4\u03c0 \u2212 \u01eb, thus a total of N pulses. The\nparameter \u01eb is proportional to the difference of the pulse\nperiod from the first primary resonance.\nWe simulate the time evolution of the atom optics\nkicked rotor using the split operator method as described\nin [22]. We Fourier transform our wave function from position space into momentum space and back again, as the\nkick potential is a diagonal operator in position space,\nand the free evolution is a diagonal operator in momen-\n\nHere we present an experimental realization of the effective time reversal of atomic matter waves as proposed\nby Martin et. al. [17]. We use a cloud of ultra cold 87 Rb\natoms, driven by a pulsed optical standing wave, as a\nquantum \u03b4-kicked rotor system. We show that the effects\nof a certain number of kicks can be effectively reversed\nby further kicks by having a different kick sequence. We\nobserve that a significant fraction of the atoms return\nback to their original zero momentum state. As the time\nreversal is very sensitive to the original momentum, we\nobserve a narrowing of the zero momentum peak. This\nphenomenon has been named \"Loschmidt cooling\" [17],\neven though the phase space density is not increased. It\nshould be stressed that many schemes exist that narrow\nthe momentum distribution of a sample of atoms [18\u2013\n20], some of which increase the phase space density.

The kicks are sufficiently short that the evolution due to the momentum can be ignored during the\nkicks, which is equivalent to the Raman-Nath regime. We\nstart the simulation with a Gaussian wave packet with a\nwidth (2\u03c3) of 0.1 recoils in momentum space.\nThe momentum distribution after the kick sequence\ncan be written as Wp (t) = |hp|\u03c8(t)i|2 /|h0|\u03c8(0)i|2 . In Fig.\n1 we show the resulting momentum distribution in the\nsimulation after a pulse sequence as discussed. A much\nnarrowed momentum distribution around p = 0 after the\nkick sequence is observed, as the restitution of the wave\nfunction only works for very small values of p. The rest of\nthe probability is transferred to higher momentum states,\nwith offsets of 2nh\u0304k with integer n. Note however, that\nthe probability for p = 0 returns to its previous value.\nMartin et al. [17] have performed extensive simulations,\nshowing that the p = 0 peak gets narrower as the number\nof kicks N in the sequence or the intensity increases. This\ndoes however mean that fewer atoms are in this peak than\nat lower intensities and/or lower kick number. Note that\nthe final momentum distribution is not Gaussian. We\ntherefore take the FWHM as the indicator for the width\nof the peak.\nFor the experiment, a reasonable number of atoms at\nsmall initial momenta is of paramount importance, and\nwe therefore use a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of\n(F = 1) 87 Rb at a temperature of 50 nK as the source\nof atoms. The atoms are first captured and cooled in\na magneto-optical trap (MOT) then transferred using a\npush laser to a second MOT in a second, connected chamber. An ultra-high vacuum is produced in the second\nchamber by an ion pump connected to it. The condensate is formed in a dipole trap overlapped with the second\n\natoms (arb.units.)\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) The simulated momentum distribution\nafter the kick sequence (full blue line) and the initial wave\npacket (dashed green line) are shown.

The dipole trap is made by a pair of intersecting\nfocused CO2 laser beams. A detailed description of the\nexperimental setup can be found in [22].\nWe realize the AOKR by pulsing a near resonant optical standing wave, derived from a 780 nm diode laser\nonto a BEC of \u223c 104 87 Rb atoms. The trap containing the BEC is turned off 500 \u03bcs before the kick sequence to reduce mean field effects. The kick laser is\nlocked to the S 21 , F = 2 \u2192 P 23 , F \u2032 = 3 transition in\n85\nRb isotope. Hence, the laser frequency is detuned by\n2.45 GHz from the relevant F = 1 \u2192 F = 2 resonance\n\n\f3\n1\n\n(a)\n\nP(0)\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nNo of kicks\n\n(b)\n\n0.8\n\nP(0)\n\nfrequency. The laser beam from the diode laser passes\nthrough a 50/50 beam splitter and the output beams are\nthen passed through separate acousto-optic modulators\n(AOMs) for fast switching. After passing through the\nAOMs, the two beams pass through single mode optical\nfibres and are focussed onto the BEC from opposite directions to produce a standing wave. The beam diameter\nat the focus is \u223c 100\u03bcm.\nThe laser pulses of the standing wave are the kicks\nthat modify the momentum distribution of the atoms.\nThe momentum distribution of the atoms after the kick\nsequence is measured by absorption imaging in time of\nflight, with a flight time of typically 8 ms. Just prior to\nimaging, the atoms are optically pumped to the F = 2\nstate by a 100 \u03bcs pulse on the F = 1 \u2192 F \u2032 = 2 repump\ntransition. An absorption image is then obtained using a\nprobe laser which is tuned to the S 21 , F = 2 \u2192 P 32 , F \u2032 = 3\ntransition. Typical results are shown in Fig. 2 (Top),\nwhere we show the absorption images of the momentum distribution before kicking, and the distribution after each kick. We sum the images along the rows to\nobtain a one-dimensional momentum distribution, which\ncan be compared to the simulation. The resulting momentum distribution of the ensemble after 10 kicks with\n\u01eb = 1 (bottom left) and the magnified view of central\npart of the same distribution are also shown in the figure.\nNote that some of the structure in the final distribution\nof Fig. 1 can be observed as a pedestal on the final zero\nmomentum peak in the experiment.\nAfter deconvolution with the original trap size, the\nwidth of the zero velocity peak after 10 kicks is \u03c3 = 0.21\n(recoils) as compared to \u03c3 = 0.43 (recoils) for the initial\nmomentum distribution without kicking. It should be\nnoted that the height of the zero momentum peak after\nthe full sequence does not return to the height of the original BEC peak, which is currently due to experimental\nlimitations, mainly the resolution of the imaging system\nand the observable amount of absorption.\nThe Loschmidt time reversal works for a very narrow\nrange of initial momenta, which depends on the value\nof \u01eb, the kick strength, and the total number of kicks.\nThe more narrow this range, the fewer atoms are part of\nit. Hence, experimental limitations make it difficult to\nobserve extremely narrow momentum distributions.\nThe BEC we produce in the experiment has a certain finite momentum width. In order to take into account this\ninitial momentum width in the simulation, we divide the\ninitial BEC distribution into a number of components\nand run the simulation for a range of initial momenta.\nWe sum over the thus obtained momentum distributions,\nweighted by the initial BEC distribution. To account for\nthe limited experimental resolution, we finally perform a\nconvolution of the resultant momentum profile from the\nsimulation with a Gaussian, with a width which is given\nby the experimental resolution. We can then determine\nthe height of the momentum peaks obtained corresponding to various diffraction orders.

We show the height of the zero momentum\npeak P(0), which corresponds to the number of atoms left\nwith in the resolution of the experiment relative to this\nsum in Fig. 3, going through the kick sequence for two\ndifferent kick strengths. The error bars in the experiment\nare determined by multiple runs of the experiment.\nWe observe good agreement between the simulation\nand the experiment in both cases. The normalized height\nis small after the first kick, as the probability is distributed across a number of momentum states. The\nheight increases after the second kick, as the probability density for higher momentum states is less, which is\nclear from the absorption picture in Fig. 2. After the\ncomplete kick sequence, constructive interference of the\nwave function components leads to a strong peak at zero\nmomentum. It should be noted that a maximum height\ndoes not necessarily correspond to the greatest number\nof \"cold\" atoms remaining, but rather to the most atoms\nthat appear \"cold\" within the experimental resolution re-\n\n\f4\n\n0.5\n\n0.45\n\n1\n\nWidth (recoils)\n\n\u01eb\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\n0.4\n\n2\n\u22120.2\n\n0.35\n\n0\n\np\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n0.25\n0.2\n0.5\n\n1\n\n\u01eb\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFIG. 4: (color online) Width of the zero momentum peak\nfrom experiment (blue diamonds) and simulation (red circles)\nfor a range of \u01eb values.

Initially we get some higher values of widths for\nthe central peak, which starts to decrease around \u01eb = 1\nand gets narrower at \u01eb \u2243=1.3. It should be noted that\nthere are fewer atoms where the peak is narrower. The\nresults are more clear as seen in the theoretical simulation with no convolution applied in the inset of Fig.4.\nThe return probability for the atoms is equal to 1 (in\nthe simulation). As shown, the final width of the momentum distribution changes for different \u01eb. The sidelobes appearing for \u01eb values between .5 and 1, could be\nthe evidence for the large widths obtained in this range.\nThe lobes then starts to disappear and vanishes at \u01eb \u2243\n1.3, which can be seen as a much narrower width of the\nmomentum distribution for the corresponding value of \u01eb.\nThe full structure appearing in the theory plot is difficult\nto resolve in the experiment because of limited experimental resolution, but the side-lobes can be observed in\nFig. 2. The experimentally determined widths, however,\nfollow the general trend of those from simulation after\nthe convolution.\nIn conclusion, we have experimentally observed evidence for the time reversal of atomic matter waves in the\nultra cold regime. As the time reversal only works for a\nnarrow range of initial momenta, it shows a narrowing\nof the momentum distribution. We have shown this for\na range of parameters in our experiment. In Future, it\nwould be interesting to add a potential and see the effects\nof interactions between atoms as indicated by [23] on the\nphenomenon of time reversibility in quantum chaos.\nAcknowledgements: The authors acknowledge the University of Auckland Research Fund and the Higher Eduction Commission for financial support.
