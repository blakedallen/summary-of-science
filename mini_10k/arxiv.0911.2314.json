They\nreside in host galaxies of many morphologies, and have a range of radio luminosities and x-ray\nspectra. There are obscured AGN, known as Type II AGN, that exhibit only narrow forbidden\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nemission lines emerging from the narrow line region (NLR), with scales & 100 pcs. Also, there are\nbroad-line AGN that exhibit both NLR emission and broad (> 1000 km s\u22121 ) emission lines from\nthe broad line region (BLR) with scales of light days. There is great variation in the strengths,\nshapes, and widths of emission lines. This diversity provides many opportunities for investigating\nthe physics at work in these systems.\nA powerful tool for studying AGN phenomenology is principal component analysis (PCA).\nPCA finds the eigenvectors, or most dominant relationships, within a set of input data. Boroson\n& Green (1992), hereafter BG92, performed a principal component analysis on a sample of z < 0.5\nquasars from the Palomar-Green Bright Quasar Survey (BQS; Schmidt & Green 1983), a UVselected sample of point-like quasars (where most of the light fell within 1\" on blue Palomar Sky\nSurvey prints). Spectral parameters that they used in the PCA included the the EW and FWHM of\nH\u03b2, optical Fe II, [O III] \u03bb5007, and He II \u03bb4686; ratios of the EWs of optical Fe II, [O III], and He II\nrelative to H\u03b2; and magnitude and peak flux of [O III] relative to H\u03b2, absolute magnitude, opticalto-X-ray spectral slope (\u03b1ox ), radio-loudness, and line shift, shape, and asymmetry of H\u03b2. The\neigenvector that distinguished most quasars from one another was dominated by the anticorrelation\nbetween the broad-line Fe II strength relative to broad H\u03b2 versus the peak flux of [O III]. They\nfound a second eigenvector that included a correlation among optical luminosity L, He II, and \u03b1ox .\nThe BG92 anticorrelation between Fe II/H\u03b2 and [O III]/H\u03b2, called eigenvector 1 (EV1), revealed a tie between the BLR and NLR, even though these regions occupy very different physical\nscales. At one end of this relationship lie narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1; Osterbrock & Pogge\n1985), with relatively narrow broad lines, strong Fe II/H\u03b2, weak [O III]/H\u03b2, quiet radio emission,\nand a steep slope between the x-ray and optical continuum (Laor et al. 1994, 1997). At the other\nend of EV1 lie radio galaxies with broad (> 4000 km s\u22121 ) BLR emission, strong [O III]/H\u03b2, very\nlittle Fe II, and flat slopes between the optical and x-ray regions.\nEV1 includes a correlation with the linewidth of H\u03b2 (Boller et al. 1996), which is used to\nestimate virial black hole masses. This led to the idea that EV1 could be driven by black hole mass\n(MBH ) or Eddington ratio (Lbol /LEdd ; BG92, Laor et al. 1994, 1997), so that high accretion ratios\ncorrespond to the NLS1 end of EV1. A correlation with Lbol /LEdd provides an explanation for the\nobserved x-ray properties in AGN such that a higher accretion state, or higher Lbol /LEdd , causes\nthe accretion disk to become thicker and produce more soft x-rays (e.g. Grupe 2004). Physically,\nthis thicker disk could be related to disk outflows that additionally excite Fe II (Collin & Joly 2000).\nIt is also possible that the covering factor is higher for the BLR in strong Fe II objects, resulting\nin less continuum reaching the NLR gas, which would explain the Fe II - [O III] anticorrelation.\nOver time, many parameters have been examined for correlations with EV1, such as the slope\nof the x-ray spectrum (Laor et al. 1994, 1997; Pounds et al. 1995), black hole mass and Lbol /LEdd\nor L/M (Laor et al. 1994, 1997; Boroson & Green 1992; Boroson 2002; Marziani et al. 2003b),\nradio properties (Boroson 2002) and the Fe II emission (Shang et al. 2003). Also, many authors\nhave utilized PCA to analyze correlations among measured quantities (Grupe 2004; Hamilton et al.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2008), or used PCA to find and investigate outliers with unusual properties (Francis & Wills 1999).\nStill others have chosen to apply a PCA directly to the spectra (Brotherton et al. 1994; Shang et al.\n2003; Yip et al. 2004). These investigations have provided important insights, but we still lack a\ncomplete physical understanding of the connection between the inner BLR and the far-ranging\nNLR.\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000) has provided an immense data set of\nbroad-line AGN spectra that can be useful for understanding whether the BG92 EV1 relationships\npersist in large samples. The SDSS is especially appropriate: large samples with well-defined selection criteria, larger luminosity ranges with reasonable completeness, and better spectral resolution\nthan has been available for most broad-line AGN samples in the past. The sheer number of objects\nalso provides a greater diversity of broad-line AGN properties available for study. From such a\nlarge sample, we can also identify extreme objects for further study. In this paper we report an\nSPCA of broad-line AGN from the SDSS.\nIn \u00a7 2 we discuss our sample and SPCA methodology. In \u00a7 3 we present the results of performing\nspectral PCA on our data set, and find that, over the broad range of properties in the sample,\nwe cannot find simple physical interpretations for the principal components, perhaps because of\nnonlinear relationships between the physical parameters and the observables. We further probe the\nrelationships in the sample by dividing it into three subsets. In \u00a7 4 we investigate the differences\nbetween our work and that of BG92. In \u00a7 5, we discuss properties of our most extreme subset, the\nstrong NLR objects, and examine possible reasons for their extraordinarily strong [O III] emission.\nWe find that high covering factors could be a plausible explanation for the strong NLR emission.\nWe present a summary of our results in \u00a7 6.\ns\u22121\n\nAll luminosities in this paper were calculated using the cosmological parameters H0 = 70 km\nMpc\u22121 , \u03a9M = 0.3, and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nMethodology\n\nSample Definition and Measurements\n\nWe selected a large sample of broad-line AGN spectra from the SDSS Data Release 5 (DR5;\nAdelman-McCarthy et al. 2007; York et al. 2000; Stoughton et al. 2002). The AGN in SDSS are\nselected by two primary methods. First, quasar candidates were targeted for spectroscopy by a\nphotometric color and morphological selection above a limiting magnitude of i < 19.1 (Richards\net al. 2002). Second, AGN were spectroscopically discovered in spectra that were targeted for other\nreasons, for instance as probable galaxies (Strauss et al. 2002; Eisenstein et al. 2001). When the\nlatter spectra were cross-correlated with the SDSS quasar template spectrum, they were identified\nas quasars due to their prominent broad lines and blue continuua.\nWe obtained our sample and spectral measurements from Salviander et al. (2007), which they\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nhave since extended to DR5. We selected all the DR5 objects with spectral coverage of the restframe region 4000\u20136000 \u00c5 on which we performed the SPCA. This selection includes Fe II and\n[O III] in the observed wavelength range of SDSS. We chose not to extend this wavelength region\nfurther to the red because it would result in a more severe redshift restriction, nor to the blue\nbecause we wanted the ability to do a more straightforward comparison with BG92 and they did\nnot use data blueward of 4000 \u00c5 for their sample. This limited our sample to the redshift range\nz . 0.56. We also chose to exclude objects with z < 0.1 to reduce the need of fitting the host galaxy\ncontinuua in low luminosity AGN. There are 12040 quasars in SDSS DR5 with 0.1 < z . 0.561 .\nFor consistency, all redshifts used in this paper are the SDSS DR5 spectroscopic redshifts derived\nfrom template matching rather than the Salviander et al. redshifts derived from line fitting.\nSalviander et al. fitted the spectra in the wavelength region 4000\u20135500 \u00c5 with a power law,\nFe II pseudocontinuum derived from the Marziani et al. (2003a) template, the narrow-line [O III]\n\u03bb\u03bb4960, 5008, and narrow and broad H\u03b2. Note that there was no fit to the host galaxy continuum.\nThe [O III] line ratios were fixed to their laboratory value of 1:3 for the [O III] \u03bb4960 and \u03bb5008 lines\nrespectively, and all wavelengths were fixed to their vacuum values as well. The narrow component\nof H\u03b2 was fixed to the same redshift and line profile as the [O III] line, with 10% of the flux.\nThe broad component of H\u03b2 was allowed to vary independently. The emission lines were all fitted\nusing Gauss-Hermite polynomials, which allow straightforward parameterization of line shapes and\nasymmetries. The measurements include L\n, which is \u03bbL\u03bb at 5100 \u00c5, rest-frame EWFeII , and\n5100\u00c5\nthe line-shape, rest-frame EW, integrated line flux, and FWHM for each of the emission lines. The\nfitting procedure is described in more detail in Salviander et al.\nWe decided to be more conservative in our sample selection than Salviander et al. by excluding\npotential Type II AGN from our sample, since we wished to investigate relationships between the\nBLR and NLR. To do this, we conservatively eliminated objects with FWHM of broad H\u03b2 < 2000\nkm s\u22121 . We compared the results of performing a spectral principal component analysis (SPCA)\non this sample with a sample including objects with FWHM H\u03b2 as low as 1050 km s\u22121 and found\nthat the principal components were virtually identical. The linewidth cut reduced the sample to\n9362 objects.\nLastly, like Salviander et al., we eliminated the objects with a failed fit of the H\u03b2 broad line\nsince we wished to use H\u03b2 parameters in our analyses. In general, the fits failed when the spectrum\nhad low S/N, absence of the broad line, or cosmetic defects such as cosmic rays. However, unlike\nSalviander et al. we chose to include objects with failed fits of [O III] since they were likely weak\n[O III] objects. The H\u03b2 failed fits removed only 316 objects, or 3% of the sample. Our final data\nset consisted of 9046 objects.\nThe objects in our sample were targeted for spectroscopic followup by the SDSS pipeline for\n1\n\nWe made no cuts based on the SDSS confidence in the measured redshifts. After inspecting a random subsample\nof objects with confidences < 90%, we confirmed that at least 90% of these are noisy AGN and are not concerned\nthat they will affect our results.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\na variety of reasons. We found that 88% of the sample were primarily targeted as quasars of some\nsort. The very low luminosity objects were generally targeted as galaxies, but this represents only\n0.4% of the total sample. Only 4% of our sample were \"serendipitous,\" but these do not have\nunusual principal component properties (see below). The other 7.6% were targeted primarily for\nan assortment of other reasons, including ROSAT and FIRST detections, blue stars, etc.\n\n2.2.\n\nSPCA Procedure\n\nPCA is a powerful tool because it provides a means of classifying and potentially distilling\nimportant relationships among the data (Francis et al. 1992, and references therein). PCA extracts\northogonal eigenvectors, each consisting of a linear combination of input variables. They are conventionally ordered according to the fraction of sample variance represented by each eigenvector.\nAlthough there is no a priori reason, the hope is that the sample variance can be represented by\nonly a small number of eigenvectors, so PCA results in a drastic simplification of the entire dataset.\nFor example, BG92 found that 51% of the variance in their sample was represented by the first two\neigenvectors. Additionally, one hopes that these eigenvectors illuminate physical relationships. Indeed, BG92 (updated by Boroson 2002) found that EV1 is related to MBH or Eddington ratio and\nEV2 is related to L. However, in nature the relationships among various parameters of an object\nmay not be well-described by a linear analysis. For instance, a certain characteristic may apply to\nonly a subset of objects. This may make physical interpretations difficult and confuse relationships\namong the input parameters, but the PCA still appears to provide a useful description of the data.\nWhile many authors have used direct line and continuum measurements as input data for\nPCA, there is another approach. Spectral PCA or SPCA has been proven to reduce various\nsamples (Brotherton et al. 1994; Shang et al. 2003; Yip et al. 2004) down to only a handful of\ncomponents that reproduce the vast majority of quasar-to-quasar spectral differences. SPCA uses\nthe flux densities binned in wavelength as input parameters to solve for orthogonal eigenvectors,\nor principal components (PCs Francis et al. 1992). Since the input variables are not the same, the\nfeatures responsible for most of the variance within a sample can be different than in a PCA. For\nexample, many continuum bins are likely to result in a greater contribution from the continuum to\nthe PCs in an SPCA. The resulting PCs are not typical spectra, with flux versus wavelength, but\nare representations of how wavelength regions correlate with one another (C\u03bb ). Positive correlations\nbetween wavelength regions appear as features pointing the same direction, while anticorrelations\nappear with opposite directions. SPCA retains information for each input spectrum in the form of\nthe coefficients (scores) for each PC. The coefficients can then be compared with various measured\nproperties of the AGN (e.g. black hole masses) in the hopes of gaining additional insights. One\nbenefit of SPCA is the ability to easily identify extreme objects as outliers in a PC-PC plane\nusing the PC coefficients for each object. Another benefit of SPCA is that there is no need to\nextract measured quantities from the spectra, so there are no added uncertainties from continuum\nestimation or fitting errors. In our case, the spectrum-to-spectrum noise in the results are reduced\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nby the large numbers of SDSS spectra. We can include spectra with low signal-to-noise ratios whose\nfeatures may be difficult to measure accurately, and these spectra will not bias the results.\nWhile SPCA is a different approach to a PCA like BG92's because it uses very different input parameters, in the case of optical spectra of luminous quasars they still yield meaningful and\ncomparable results. Shang et al. (2003) carried out an SPCA on the same limited optical region\nthat we used for a sample made up of a subset of the quasars in BG92. By comparing their components with measured spectral parameters, they were able to justify their physically meaningful\ninterpretations of the PCs. They also showed that, in the same optical region as in BG92, as few\nas two PCs dominate the sample variance. Moreover these, PC1 and PC3, appeared to represent\nthe same physical quantities as BG92's EV1 and EV2. They showed this by direct correlation of\nthe coefficients of their PCs for each spectrum with the physical quantities apparently underlying\nthe BG92 eigenvectors. These earlier studies were for relatively small samples of luminous quasars\n(MV . \u221223). Can we extend these studies of the optical region to the much larger SDSS sample,\ncovering a wider range of L?\n\n3.\n\nSPCA Results\n\nWe performed an SPCA on our entire sample of 9046 SDSS broad-line AGN, using the code\ndeveloped by Francis et al. (1992). We normalized each spectrum by its mean flux, and we do not\ndivide by the standard deviation. In what follows we look for features within the PCs and then\nconfirm that they correspond to trends in the measured properties of the input spectra.\n\n3.1.\n\nEntire Data Set\n\nThe mean spectrum and first two PCs for our entire data set are shown in Figure 1. We\nuse ALL:PC1 to denote the first PC from the SPCA run on the entire data set, ALL:PC2 for the\nsecond, and so on. ALL:PC1, which accounts for 35% of the variance, appears to show a strong\ncorrelation among EWs of lines from the NLR, including [O III], the narrow Balmer lines, and He II\n\u03bb4686. There is a less prominent anticorrelation between the EW of the narrow lines and the EW\nof the Fe II blends that originate in the BLR. If this qualitative interpretation of the PCs is correct,\none would expect to see a correlation between the ALL:PC1 coefficients for individual spectra when\ncompared with the measured values of EW[OIII] and an inverse correlation with EWFeII . We plot\nthese values in Figure 2 and find that, in fact, the EW[OIII] is indeed strongly correlated with\nALL:PC1 coefficients, with a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.95. Figure 2(b) shows a less\nobvious anticorrelation between EWFeII and ALL:PC1, which has a Spearman correlation coefficient\nof \u22120.297. Given these relationships, ALL:PC1 is the component that most closely reproduces the\ncorrelations in the traditional EV1. However, in at least one respect ALL:PC1 deviates significantly\nfrom the BG92 EV1. ALL:PC1 does not appear to include any correlation with the linewidth of\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Mean spectrum (top), PC1 (middle), and PC2 (bottom) for the entire data set. ALL:PC1\nshows correlations among the NLR lines and ALL:PC2 incorporates the continuum slope and the\nbroad Balmer lines. The dotted line denotes C\u03bb = 0, which distinguishes positive and negative\nfeatures.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nbroad H\u03b2, which would be present in the PC as a \"M\"-shaped pattern centered at H\u03b2 (Shang\net al. 2003, hereafter S03). There is no strong correlation between ALL:PC1 and the FWHM of\nH\u03b2 (Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.076; Figure 2(c)). At face value, our result disagrees\nwith the classic BG92 finding that the strength of the Fe II emission strongly anticorrelates with\nthe FWHM of H\u03b2. By plotting the EWFeII directly against the FWHM of H\u03b2 (Figure 2(d)), we\nnote that the entire sample appears to have an anticorrelation between the two, but there is a large\namount of scatter (Spearman correlation coefficient of \u22120.198). Several authors (S03, Yip et al.\n2004) have performed similar SPCAs using the rest-frame optical region of the spectrum. While\nthe small, high-luminosity sample used by S03 seems to recover EV1 correlations, the large samples\nused here and in Yip et al. (2004) do not include the strong linewidth dependence of broad H\u03b2.\nThe dominant correlations present in ALL:PC2, which accounts for 20% of the variance, are\npositive correlations between all broad lines and continuum shape (objects with a strongly sloped\ncontinuum will have more contribution from PC2 compared with objects with a flat continuum).\nWe also find that ALL:PC2 is correlated with L5100 , with a Spearman correlation probability of\n< 0.001 that they are not correlated. Further components of the entire data set each account for\n< 12% of the variance among the spectra and we do not offer interpretations of them.\nSince our large sample and others do not seem to entirely recover the traditional EV1 correlations, we wonder if our choice of such a large, diverse sample is potentially masking our ability to\nnotice relationships among the data. Over the range of properties that the objects in our sample\nexhibit, the distribution of a given property may saturate for a subset of objects. Alternatively, the\nrelationship between properties need not be linear. For instance, the EW[OIII] spans such a large\nrange relative to other properties that it dominates ALL:PC1 and therefore the SPCA results of\nthe entire data set. Thus, an SPCA that uses the entire sample is possibly less likely to result in\nPCs that are directly interpretable in terms of physical properties.\n\n3.2.\n\nSubsets\n\nOne way to investigate relationships that might be diluted by the large range of properties in the\nentire sample is to divide the sample into subsets. SDSS, with the large sample it provides, affords\nus an opportunity to investigate subsets with particular properties. Because ALL:PC1 encompasses\nthe relationships representing the largest spectrum-to-spectrum variation among the objects in the\nentire data set, we chose to divide our sample into subsets based on the ALL:PC1 coefficient of\neach object. We settled on the following three subsets, which isolate the extremes of the EW[OIII]\nrange: S1, which has ALL:PC1 < 0 and includes 6317 objects, S2 with 0 < ALL:PC1 < 7 includes\n2307 objects, and S3 with ALL:PC1 > 7 includes only 422 objects (see Figure 3). These subset\ndivisions are roughly equivalent to EW[OIII] < 15 \u00c5, 15 \u2212 50 \u00c5, and > 50 \u00c5 for S1, S2, and S3,\nrespectively. However, by restricting the range of EW[OIII] , we realize we might be reducing the\nimportance of any relationships that do include EW[OIII] .\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\nFig. 2.- (a) EW[OIII] versus ALL:PC1 Coefficients.

It includes \u223c 70% of the original data set and therefore\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nilluminates the relationships among the bulk of broad-line AGN. This subset consists of objects with\na negative value of ALL:PC1, which means that reconstructing their spectra requires subtracting\nNLR emission from the original mean spectrum, so this subset includes the weakest EW[OIII] .\nAs objects representing the strongest EW[OIII] have been removed, ALL:PC2, representing the\nrelationship between BLR emission and the continuum slope, becomes the first principal component\n(S1:PC1). S1:PC2 includes a correlation among EWs of all emission (Balmer lines and He II) and\n[O III]. This subset also more closely recovers EV1 relationships in S1:PC3. Note that there is a\n\"W\" linewidth signature for H\u03b2 in S1:PC3, so this component links FWHMH\u03b2 , Fe II and [O III]\nin a way similar to EV1. To cross-check our qualitative interpretation of the PCs, we compare\nthese three quantities with the coefficient of S1:PC3 (Figure 5). The EW[OIII] and FWHMH\u03b2\nanticorrelate with the S1:PC3 coefficient, with Spearman correlation coefficients of \u22120.447 and\n\u22120.549 respectively. The EWFeII shows a correlation with S1:PC3 and a Spearman correlation\ncoefficient of 0.310. These are the sense of relationships we would expect to see within BG92's EV1,\nand when we examined EWFeII versus FWHMH\u03b2 (Figure 5(d)), we found an inverse correlation for\nS1 (Spearman correlation coefficient of \u22120.221) although there is an enormous amount of scatter\nin the data. Additional PCs account for only a few percent of the object-to-object variation within\nthe subset, and so we do not interpret them.\nThe third subset, S3, which includes less than 5% of the entire data set, is responsible for\nthe most prominent relationships in ALL:PC1. S3:PC1 (right column of Figures 3.2) shares the\nrelationships seen in ALL:PC1. Effectively, the extreme variation of EW[OIII] embodied in S3\ncompared to the rest of the entire sample was dominating the relationships that account for the\nmost object-to-object variance among the 9046 object data set.\nAs is evident after examining the S3:PCs, they are entirely dominated by variations in NLR\nemission lines, except for S3:PC4, which shows the same continuum slope and broad Balmer lines\nas ALL:PC2. The S3:PCs represent correlations among NLR lines in terms of EW, asymmetry\nor shift, linewidth, and even stronger asymmetry in S3:PC5. However, note that even though\nthese 422 objects are clearly dominated by their NLR emission, they are selected to be broad-line\nAGN, not Type II AGN (see \u00a7 4). The mean spectrum for this subset shows a distinct broad H\u03b2\ncontribution to the spectrum. We will address in Section \u00a7 5 possible reasons for these objects'\nextraordinarily strong NLR emission lines.\nIn the middle column of Figures 3.2 and 4, we present results for the second subset, S2, which\nincludes objects with ALL:PC1 coefficients between 0 and 7. This subset, which is comprised of\n2307 objects or about 1/4 of the entire data set, has properties intermediate between S1 and S3.\nIn S2:PC1, we basically recover ALL:PC2, which is a component dominated by broad Balmer lines\nand continuum shape. S2:PC2 seems similar to ALL:PC1, dominated by NLR emission, but with\nadditional continuum information as well. S2:PC3 represents asymmetry in the NLR lines that\ncould be caused by errors in the redshifts or real shifts in the emission lines.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n4.\n\nComparison with Previous Work\n\nOne reason for our investigation was to examine the EV1 relationships among a larger, more\ndiverse sample than BG92 and S03. While S03 did recover the traditional EV1 relationships,\nincluding the anticorrelation of [O III] and Fe II, and the simultaneous correlation of Fe II and\nFWHMH\u03b2 , the PCs from our original entire data set do not show these relationships clearly at all.\nThis implies that the crucial difference between our results and theirs have to do with the samples\nthemselves.\nBecause ALL:PC1 is dominated by NLR emission, where BG92 and S03 did not find a similar\ncomponent with such dramatic NLR characteristics, we wondered if the main difference between our\nSDSS sample and theirs was the NLR properties of the samples. To investigate this, we compared\nthe distribution of EW[OIII] from BG92 with our distribution (see the histogram in Figure 2(a)).\nOur range of EW[OIII] extended to objects with three times stronger [O III]. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov\n(K-S) test, which returns the maximum discrepancies between the two samples using both one-sided\ncases and the two-sided case, results in an inconclusive P=0.04 likelihood that the two EW[OIII]\ndistributions are drawn from the same parent distribution. In Figure 3, we include the PG quasars\nthat have spectroscopic observations from the SDSS. There are only two PG quasars that fall in\nour strong [O III] subset, S3, but there are few enough points we cannot conclude that the [O III]\ndistribution is significantly different. It is interesting to note that all the PG quasars have positive\nALL:PC2, indicating that they fall among the luminous, blue objects within ALL:PC2-space.\nThere is a much more crucial difference between the two subsamples, namely luminosity. The\nPG quasars used by BG92 and S03 include only high luminosity sources with a nominal absolute\nmagnitude of MV \u2264 \u221223 (L\n& 1044.7 erg s\u22121 ) although \u223c20% of the PG quasars are below\n5100\u00c5\nthis nominal limit. This is a striking difference from our luminosity distribution, where only \u223c6%\nof the objects have L\n> 1044.7 erg s\u22121 . Indeed the EW[OIII] distribution for our high-L\n5100\u00c5\n5100\u00c5\nobjects is quite similar to that of BG92, although their inclusion of fainter objects makes an exact\ncomparison difficult. When we performed SPCA on the 584 objects with L\n& 1044.7 erg s\u22121 ,\n5100\u00c5\nwe did in fact recover a PC1 that is similar to S03's first principal component, although ours still\nhas more NLR contribution. It has a more striking [O III] - Fe II anticorrelation than ALL:PC1\nand includes H\u03b2 linewidth dependence (Figure 6). Again, these relationships are confirmed by\nthe measurements shown in Figure 7. In fact, plotting EWFeII versus FWHMH\u03b2 (Figure 7(d))\nfor these objects shows a dramatic correlation between the two (Spearman correlation coefficient\nof \u22120.411). This confirms that we are recovering the correlations from BG92's EV1 in this set of\nhigh L objects, although there is a large amount of scatter.\nThe luminosity difference between the PG quasars and our original sample apparently leads to\nthe different NLR emission in ALL:PC1. However, within our SDSS sample, we found no conclusive\ndifference between the L\ndistributions of the whole SDSS sample and S3, where the K-S test\n5100\u00c5\nresults in 0.36 probability that they are from the same parent distribution (see \u00a7 5.3). Additionally,\nat low L\n, we do not see a clear correlation between EW[OIII] and L\n(see Fig. 8), possibly\n5100\u00c5\n5100\u00c5\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- Mean spectrum, PC1, and PC2 for the the 584 objects with L\n> 1044.7 erg s\u22121 .

From\n5100\u00c5\nour data we are unable to disentangle whether the drop in EW[OIII] at high L is strictly dependent\non luminosity or Eddington ratio, but for low L and Lbol /LEdd there is no correlation.\ndue to the large scatter in the data, but clearly there is a drop in EW[OIII] at very high L\n.\n5100\u00c5\nCroom et al. (2002) also did not find a decrease in EW[OIII] as a function of L for a sample spanning\na similar range of L and z as this one, although they do find a trend with other NLR emission lines.\nHowever, they explain that the effect is not seen in [O III] because it is observed at lower z, and in\nthe local universe there is a lack of especially high-L objects. Other studies with targets at higher L,\nsuch as Netzer et al. (2006, 2004) and Marziani et al. (2009), do find a clear anticorrelation between\nEW[OIII] and L. It would be interesting to know if this drop in EW[OIII] was strictly dependent on\nL or more dependent on Lbol /LEdd , to better understand the physical relationships in AGN since,\nfor example, opening angle is luminosity-dependent (e.g. Lawrence 1991; Simpson 2003). It has\nbeen hypothesized (Dong et al. 2005; Simpson 2005; Netzer et al. 2006) that variations in opening\nangle, which depends on L, impact the strength of [O III] emission that is observed. However, the\nfact that narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s), which are thought to be in a particularly high\naccretion state, are distinguished by extreme EV1 properties does suggest that there is a correlation\nbetween Lbol /LEdd and EW[OIII] . (Note that since we have excluded NLS1s from our sample, we\nmay have removed the highest Lbol /LEdd , low EW[OIII] objects from our analysis.) The Eddington\nratio (Fig. 8) of our sample does not seem to have a correlation with the [O III] strength, except\nat high Eddington fractions. With these data, we cannot distinguish whether this drop in EW[OIII]\nis an effect of L or Lbol /LEdd .\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- Histograms for the distribution of the entire data set, with upward-right slanting hashes,\nand just S3, with downward-right slanting hashes, for luminosity, Eddington ratio, FWHM[OIII] ,\ncontinuum color, redshift, and EW[OIII] . The luminosity and redshift distributions are quite similar,\nbut the objects in S3 have notably narrower and stronger [O III] emission.\n5.\n\nThe Strong [O III] Subset\n\nIn this section we search for the cause of the large narrow-line equivalent widths in the spectra\nof the AGN in the S3 sample. We first look at the radio loudness of the S3 objects but find no\ncorrelation. We then look for signatures of extra obscuration of the AGN in S3 relative to the\nentire sample due to orientation effects, which might lower the AGN continuum and increase the\nnarrow-line equivalent widths, but find no strong signatures. Finally we search for other differences\nbetween the spectral properties of the AGN in the S3 sample and those in the S1 and S2 samples.\nWe conclude this section with a brief discussion suggesting that larger covering factors account for\nthe large equivalent widths.\n\n5.1.\n\nRadio Properties\n\nPast authors (e.g. Ho & Peng 2001, and references therein) investigated the degree to which\nradio power correlates with L[OIII] , and found that for radio-quiet sources, the correlation is quite\nstrong. We investigate the radio properties of the objects in the strong [O III] subset to see if\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.- Radio magnitude, t = \u22122.5log(Frad /3631Jy), vs. i -band magnitude for the 735 objects\nwith radio detections. The dotted lines denote the magnitude limits of SDSS and FIRST, at\ni < 19.1 and t < 16.5 respectively. The solid line is log R = 1, demarcating the transition between\nradio-loud and radio-quiet objects. The dashed lines are lines of constant log R equaling 0, 2, and 3\nfrom bottom to top. The long-dashed line, perpendicular to the lines of constant log R and passing\nthrough the intersection of log R = 3 with the SDSS magnitude limit, denotes a complete sample.\nRed triangles represent S1, blue squares represent S2, and green circles represent S3. The colored\nhistograms represent the stringent sample distribution in t, with colors as before.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nthey have correspondingly strong radio emission. We cross-correlated our list of 9046 SDSS objects\nwith the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST) catalog of radio sources.\nThe FIRST survey was conducted using the Very Large Array (VLA) and covers over 9000 square\ndegrees of sky. The detection threshold is 1mJy at 1.4 GHz in the observed frame. We find 735\nradio detections within 2\" of the optical source for our sample. We chose a 2\" search radius as it\nhas been shown that the number of meaningful correlations with optical AGN detections drops off\nrapidly outside 2\" (Ivezi\u0107 et al. 2002; Rafter et al. 2009; Husemann et al. 2008).\nOf the 9046 objects in our entire data set, 8460 lie within the FIRST footprint, rejecting less\nthan 10%. Therefore, the 735 detections represent 8% of the data set within the observing area\nof FIRST. However, of the 422 objects in S3, 404 were within the footprint, with 92 detections,\nyielding a fraction of 22% detected. Thus, a higher proportion of the strong [O III] objects have\ndetectable radio emission.\nThe S3 objects have the same redshift distribution as the entire data set (Figure 9), so the\nhigher detection percentage for S3 is possibly meaningful but susceptible to various selection biases.\nAs an extra precaution, we follow the prescription in Ivezi\u0107 et al. (2002) for defining a \"stringent\nradio sample\" that is not subject to a Malmquist bias for detections from either FIRST or SDSS.\nThe Malmquist bias results in extra detections near the flux limit of a given survey due to statistical\nerrors in detection.\nWe selected a complete sample above, well within the flux limits of both SDSS and FIRST. In\nFigure 10, we have plotted the observed radio magnitude, t = \u22122.5log(Frad /3631Jy), where we use\nthe integrated radio flux density of the detected objects versus their i-band magnitude following\nIvezi\u0107 et al. (2002). We calculate the radio to optical flux density ratio as log R = 0.4(i \u2212 t) (Ivezi\u0107\net al. 2002). The flux limits of both SDSS, at i < 19.1, and FIRST, at t < 16.5, are shown as the\ndotted vertical and horizontal lines. To simplify the analysis, we did not include a K-correction,\nbut chose to use the observed magnitudes for the radio and i -band.\nTo select a complete sample, we wanted to span the full range observed in log R, where the\nshort-dashed lines are lines of constant log R. We selected the stringent radio sample by taking\nobjects that lie above the long-dashed line perpendicular to the lines of constant log R and within\n0 <log R < 3, which then includes only objects safely within the flux limits. The solid line denotes\nlog R = 1, which separates radio-loud objects (log R > 1) from radio-quiet objects (log R < 1).\nWithin this stringent sample, we have plotted objects included in S1 as red triangles, objects in S2\nas blue squares, and objects in S3 as green circles.\nIf radio properties were really physically related to extreme NLR emission, then we would\nexpect the S3 objects within the stringent radio sample to have significantly higher values of log\nR than those in S1 and S2. However, within the stringent sample, the distribution of S3 objects is\nnot noticeably biased toward the radio-loud side of the sample. Figure 9 includes the histogram\nof the distribution of S3 objects in t, compared with the rest of the stringent sample. While the\nK-S test results in only a 0.6% chance that the whole stringent radio sample and S3 objects within\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nit are from the same parent distribution, there does not appear to be a striking correlation of\nradio-loudness with [O III] emission. One caveat to this conclusion is the small number statistics\nwithin the stringent radio sample, as there are only 9 objects from S3. The radio properties might\nbe somewhat different between the S3 objects and the rest of the stringent sample, and S3 does\nappear to have a higher percentage of objects that are detected in the radio compared with the\nentire data set, but there is not a simple increase of radio-loudness with EW[OIII] .\n\n5.2.\n\n\"Buried AGN\" Hypothesis\n\nIn the orientation Unified Scheme, AGN are surrounded by an optically-thick dusty torus (e.g.\nAntonucci 1993). If the observer's line of sight to the nucleus misses the torus, the observer sees\nboth the broad-line and narrow-line regions; but if the line of sight passes through the torus, the\nBLR is obscured \u2013 the AGN is \"buried\"\u2013 and the observer sees only a narrow-line spectrum from\nunobscured gas far from nucleus. Indeed, given the proper orientation, an optically-thick cloud\nof dust anywhere in the host galaxy can obscure the AGN. If, for instance, the line of sight to\nthe AGN just grazes the torus, the AGN is partially obscured. The broad-line emission and the\nAGN continuum appear weaker, the latter leading to higher equivalent widths for the narrow lines.\nExamples of these objects include Seyfert 1.5-1.8 galaxies (Antonucci 1993; Tran 1995; Leighly\net al. 1997; Cohen et al. 1999) that have strong narrow-line emission and weak broad-line emission.\nOur composite S3 spectrum closely resembles the spectra of Seyfert 1.5-1.8 galaxies. Does\nobscuration of objects in S3 cause them to have high EW[OIII] ? We first note that the S3 sample\ndefinitely includes buried AGN, possibly many buried AGN. We will see that the broad-line H\u03b1/H\u03b2\nflux ratio is large in some of the S3 AGN, a clear signal of reddening; a visual inspection of individual\nspectra in the S3 sample quickly finds classic Seyfert 1.5-1.8 objects; and component S3:PC4 is\na broad-line, blue-continuum component devoid of NLR features that is introduced by variable\nobscuration and reddening. The question, though, is whether the obscuration in the S3 sample is\ncausing higher EW[OIII] . We first investigate whether the obscuration in the S3 sample as a whole is\ndifferent from the obscuration in the S1 and S2 samples. There are several tests that might answer\nthis question.\nFirst, if the AGN in the S3 sample are more obscured than the AGN in the S1 and S2 samples,\nthey might be fainter than the AGN in S1 and S2. The mean L\nof each subset is 1.39 \u00d7 1044 ,\n5100\u00c5\n44\n43\n\u22121\n1.06 \u00d7 10 , and 9.68 \u00d7 10 erg s for S1, S2, and S3 respectively. Thus, the mean L\nof the S3\n5100\u00c5\nAGN is, indeed, lower than the mean luminosity of the AGN in the other sets, but the maximum\ndifference is a factor of just 1.4, much less than the difference in mean [O III] equivalent widths.\nThis test is not a strong one, given the steep luminosity function of AGN. We also compared the\ndistribution of L\nluminosities within the S3 sample to the distribution for the entire sample\n5100\u00c5\n(see Figure 9). (The S3 objects comprise a small fraction of the entire sample, so a comparison of\nthe S3 sample with the entire sample is essentially a comparison with S3 to S1 plus S2.) A K-S\ntest yields a P = 0.36 probability that the S3 sample comes from the same parent distribution as\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nthe entire sample. Thus there is no evidence that the luminosities of the S3 AGN are lower than\nthe luminosities of the entire AGN sample by enough to account for the higher narrow-line EWs.\nSecond, if the AGN in the S3 sample are more obscured than the entire sample, they should\nbe more reddened and their colors should be different. We defined the color to be the log of the\nratio of the median fluxes in 20 \u00c5 bins at 3610 \u00c5 and 5100 \u00c5 that are relatively free of emission\nlines. We compared the color distribution for S3 to that of the entire data set (see Figure 9). A\nK-S test finds a P = 0.78 probability that the two distributions are drawn from the same parent\nsample. Thus this test finds no evidence for more reddening in the S3 sample than in the entire\nsample.\nThird, because the continuum and the BLR emission lines do not necessarily arise in the same\nspatial regions, they could be reddened differently. Therefore we tested whether the behavior of\nthe H\u03b1/H\u03b2 flux ratio, which is a good reddening indicator for the BLR region, is different from the\nbehavior of the continuum colors. We measured the Balmer decrement for the 51 objects in the S3\nsample with z < 0.35 so that both H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 are visible in their SDSS spectra. We fitted their\nspectra using the IRAF package specfit between 6400\u20136800 \u00c5, using 8 components for the fits: a\nfixed power law for the continuum, Gaussians for the [S II] \u03bb\u03bb6717, 6730 doublet, the [N II] \u03bb\u03bb6547,\n6583 doublet, the narrow component of H\u03b1, and two Gaussians for the broad component of H\u03b1,\nwith the narrow-lines all forced to have the same width. The Balmer decrement for the BLR is\nthe ratio of broad H\u03b1 flux to broad H\u03b2 flux. We measured the mean Balmer decrement for the 51\nobjects as 8.311, and it ranged from 3.37 \u2013 78.2. We found a Spearman correlation probabilty of\nP < 0.001 between the Balmer decrements and the measured continuum flux ratios, indicating a\nlow probability of no correlation. We conclude that we are justified in using the continuum color\nas a reddening indicator.\nIn summary, the tests we applied to the data yielded no evidence for more obscuration in\nthe S3 sample than in the entire sample. The interpretation of the test for a color difference is\nsomewhat muddied by the presence of host galaxy contamination in some low-luminosity objects.\nFor example, one might imagine that the S1 and S2 samples are redder because they have more\ngalaxy contamination, while the S3 objects are redder because they are more obscured, leaving\nthe two groups with the same colors. Thus colors would not necessarily reveal extra obscuration\nin the S3 sample. To see whether host-galaxy contamination might be affecting the color test, we\nlooked at the colors of only the most luminous objects (where z > 0.45 and log L\n> 43.5).\n5100\u00c5\nEven in this high luminosity bin, where galaxy contamination is minimal, the mean color of the S3\nsample is similar to the mean color of the entire sample (log F3610 /F\n= 0.34 for the S3 sample\n5100\u00c5\nand 0.35 for the entire sample). Balmer decrements are difficult to measure if H\u03b2 is weak. Since\nwe have restricted our discussion of the Balmer decrement to those systems for which the Balmer\ndecrement is reliably measured, we have excluded exactly those systems with large decrements\nthat might have cast doubt on color as a measure of reddening. On the other hand, the number\nexcluded with unreliable measurements of H\u03b2 is only 3% of the entire sample, so this is not likely\nto introduce a large bias.\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nThe previous paragraph shows that one must be cautious not to overinterpret the tests for\nexcess obscuration in the S3 sample. We are, nevertheless, left with no convincing evidence for\nmore obscuration in the S3 sample than in the entire sample, and must conclude that the greater\nEW of the [O III] lines in the S3 sample cannot be attributed entirely to extra obscuration. Some\nadditional factor is affecting the equivalent widths. Our comparisons of luminosity and color suggest\nthat obscuration and galaxy contamination is similar in S1 and S3; AGN in S3 may be those in\nwhich the strength of [O III] is sufficient to be further enhanced by obscuration. Nevertheless we\nask what produces this strong [O III].\n\n5.3.\n\nSpectral Properties\n\nSince neither radio-loudness nor orientation can alone account for the larger NLR EW in the S3\nsample, we now turn to a global comparison of the spectral properties of each subset. One difference\nis that the EWFeII appears much larger in the S1 and S2 samples than the S3 sample. This is visible\nin the mean spectra for each sample and also in ALL:PC1, in which Fe II is anticorrelated with\n[O III]. The Fe II features are extremely weak or non-existent in the mean S3 spectrum and all the\nS3 principal components. The broad components of the Balmer lines are still present in the S3\nsample, so the BLR is still visible on average even though the Fe II lines are not. For a crude test\nof the ionization state among the subsets, we used the IRAF routine splot to measure the flux ratio\nof He II to narrow H\u03b2 from the mean spectra (Figure 3.2). We measured the ratio to be 0.432\nfor S1, 0.309 for S2, and 0.237 for S3. Thus, it appears that there may be a decrease in ionization\nstate with increasing NLR strength.\nTo investigate other parameters that may shed light on the physics in the objects in S3, we\nused K-S tests to compare the distributions of the entire data set with those of S3. We compared\ndistributions of Gauss-Hermite coefficients h3 and h4, EW, and FWHM for H\u03b2 and [O III] (see\nFigure 9). With the exception of H\u03b2 h4 and the [O III] FWHM the K-S tests yielded probabilities\nbetween 0.35 and 0.99 that the samples are drawn from the same parent distribution (0.04 and\n0.10 for H\u03b2 h4 and the [O III] FWHM respectively). We conclude that with the possible exception\nof H\u03b2 h4 and the [O III] FWHM the objects in the S3 sample do not differ significantly from the\nentire sample in any of these properties. A narrower [O III] FWHM in S3 could imply that the\nNLR gas is further from the center of the AGN, which would be expected if orientation or covering\nfactor played into the explanation for strong EW[OIII] . An investigation of the x-ray properties of\nthese objects would be interesting, as x-ray luminosity has been shown to correlate with L[OIII]\n(Heckman et al. 2005; Panessa et al. 2006) and \u03b1ox indicates weaker X-ray flux, compared with the\noptical, for higher EW[OIII] (BG92), but that is beyond the scope of this work.\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n5.4.\n\nCovering Factor\n\nVariations in EW[OIII] can also result from differences in covering factor, density, or a relatively\nhigh ionization parameter. Baskin & Laor (2005), hereafter BL05, investigated the [O III] line\nstrengths in the PG quasars. Their photoionization models suggested that it is covering factor that\ncauses differences in [O III]. If the covering factor is large, the NLR gas intercepts a larger amount\nof continuum and produces relatively stronger lines.\nTo determine whether our strong [O III] objects show any evidence of special physical conditions, such as unusual electron density or ionization parameter, we examined the spectra of the 16\nobjects in S3 with largest EW[OIII] . Using Figs 1 and 2 in BL05, and the [O III] \u03bb4363/\u03bb5007 and\n[O III] \u03bb5007/broad H\u03b2 line flux ratios (exhibiting a mean log [O III] \u03bb4363/\u03bb5007 = \u22121.62 \u00b1 0.10,\nand a range of log [O III] \u03bb5007/broad H\u03b2 from 1.0 \u2013 1.18), we conclude that physical conditions\nare typical of AGN NLRs (Peterson 1997). Covering factor then becomes the most likely reason\nfor the large [O III] EW in the S3 AGN. Assuming that we see the true continuum in the bluest\nAGN (the presence of Ca II K absorption and the 4000 \u00c5 break in continuum slope show that host\ngalaxy starlight contributes in the redder AGN, although dust reddening is also probably involved),\nwe deduce that large but physical NLR covering factors of & 0.35 are required. However, we cannot make a convincing choice among the various reasons why the covering factor might be large.\nThere might be more illuminated gas in the NLR of the S3 objects, perhaps as a result of larger\nfilling factor in the ionization cone, or a larger opening angle. These two scenarios would result\nin different infrared properties. If S3 objects have a larger opening angle, we would expect these\nobjects to have less radiation absorbed and reprocessed into the infrared. However, if the larger\ncovering factor were due to larger filling factor of the NLR, the infrared properties of S3 objects\nshould be the same as the rest of the data set.\n\n6.\n\nSummary\n\nWe have presented results of an SPCA of 9046 broad-line AGN from the SDSS DR5 with\n0.1 <z< 0.56 and 1042 < L\n< 1046 erg s\u22121 . We investigated the properties of the rest-frame\n5100\u00c5\n4000 - 6000 \u00c5 spectrum and found that a large range in EW[OIII] dominates the behavior of the\nsample. This range causes difficulty in interpreting the PCs. To try to understand the behavior\nof [O III], we divided our sample into three subsets to restrict the broad range of EW[OIII] . Our\nmost extreme [O III] subset had principal components dominated by NLR emission. Traditionally, the first principal component in eigenvector analysis (EV1) of quasar spectra has been an\nanticorrelation between the strengths of Fe II/H\u03b2 and [O III]/H\u03b2, and a correlation between the\nstrength of O III/H\u03b2 with H\u03b2 linewidth. While the entire sample and subsets show evidence for\nthe anticorrelation between EW[OIII] and Fe II in their components and mean spectra, we find the\nH\u03b2 linewidth to be related in only the lowest EW[OIII] subset. Overall, the width of the Balmer\nlines seems to have little dependence on the strength of [O III] or Fe II. We find that the differences\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nbetween our work and BG92 and S03 are caused by the substantially lower luminosities included\nin our sample. Also, we find that the usual anticorrelation between EW[OIII] and L only applies for\nthe very high-L end of our sample, and thus the importance of relationships among Fe II, [O III],\nand H\u03b2 linewidth is a strong function of L (or perhaps Lbol /LEdd ). Our results are consistent with\nthe \"disappearing NLR\" effect suggested by Netzer et al. (2004) where high-L AGN experience a\ndecrease in NLR emission due to loss of NLR gas from the system.\nThe strong EW[OIII] objects in our sample have dominant NLR lines that do not seem to\ncorrelate with any other properties of the broad-line AGN, including L\n, Lbol /LEdd , color, BLR\n5100\u00c5\nproperties, or radio emission. We did not find conclusive evidence for the cause of the high EW[OIII]\nin these objects, although EW[OIII] could be enhanced by suppression of the AGN continuum. We\nsuggest that the intrinsic range in [O III] emission is primarily caused by a covering factor that is\nhighly variable among AGN.\nWe thank Sarah Salviander for access to her data.
