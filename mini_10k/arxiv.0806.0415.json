The inclination of penumbral magnetic fields fluctuates with azimuthal angle around the spot center (Degenhardt & Wiehr 1991; Title et al. 1993; Lites et al. 1993; Stanchfield et al. 1997;\nWestendorp Plaza et al. 2001a,b; Bello Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2005; Langhans et al. 2005). The\nbright penumbral filaments have magnetic fields that are more vertical than those of the dark\npenumbral filaments in the outer penumbra. The vertical and horizontal components of the\npenumbral fields have been called a \"penumbral spine\" and a \"penumbral intra-spine,\" respectively (Lites et al. 1993). Radial flows and radial motions are also observed in the penumbra. The Evershed flow is a horizontal outward flow along the horizontal component of the\npenumbral magnetic fields (Degenhardt & Wiehr 1991; Title et al. 1993; Lites et al. 1993;\nRimmele 1995; Stanchfield et al. 1997; Westendorp Plaza et al. 2001a,b; Bellot Rubio et al.\n2003, 2004; Borrero et al. 2004, 2005; Cabrera Solana et al. 2006, 2007, 2008). Evershed\nflows with supersonic velocities are sometimes inferred around the outer boundary of the\npenumbra (del Toro Iniesta et al. 2001), and are observed directly (Shimizu et al. 2008b).\nPenumbral grains, which are patchy bright features, move toward the umbra in the inner\npenumbra, and the penumbral grains in the outer penumbra show both inward and outward motions (e.g. Sobotka et al. 1999; Sobotka & S\u00fctterlin 2001; Bovelet & Wiehr 2003).\nThe Evershed flow appears to originate at the inward-moving penumbral grains in the inner\npenumbra (Rimmele & Marino 2006; Ichimoto et al. 2007). Various models have been proposed to explain the complex magnetic and velocity fields of penumbrae (e.g., Solanki & Montavon\n1993; Schlichenmaier et al. 1998; Thomas et al. 2002; Spruit & Scharmer 2006; Heinemann et al.\n2007).\nRadial outward flows are dominant in the moat region that surrounds mature sunspots.\nMoving magnetic features (MMFs) are small magnetic elements that have sizes of typically less than 2\u2032\u2032 in the moat region (Sheeley 1969; Vrabec 1971; Harvey & Harvey 1973).\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nMMFs mostly appear around the penumbral outer boundary and then move almost radially outward in the moat region for mature and decaying sunspots (Harvey & Harvey 1973;\nRyutova et al. 1998; Zhang et al. 2003; Sainz Dalda & Mart\u0131\u0301nez Pillet 2005; Ravindra 2006).\nThe lifetimes of MMFs range from a few minutes to 10 hr (Vrabec 1974; Zhang et al. 2003;\nHagenaar & Shine 2005). Those MMFs with longer lifetimes may reach the outer boundary\nof the moat region. Recent observations suggest that MMFs located on lines extrapolated\noutward from the horizontal component of the penumbral magnetic fields into the moat\nregion correspond to the photospheric intersections of undulating horizontal fields extending from the penumbra (Sainz Dalda & Mart\u0131\u0301nez Pillet 2005; Cabrera Solana et al. 2006,\n2007; Kubo et al. 2007a). This supports the \"sea serpent\" concept for MMFs, whereby the\nhorizontal penumbral fields undulate into and out of the solar surface (Harvey & Harvey\n1973; Schlichenmaier 2002). Many authors have proposed that the fluctuating penumbral\nfields and the subsequent MMFs are produced by Evershed flows (e.g., Ryutova et al. 1998;\nMart\u0131\u0301nez Pillet 2002; Thomas et al. 2002; Schlichenmaier 2002; Zhang et al. 2003, 2007b;\nCabrera Solana et al. 2006). On the other hand, MMFs located on the lines extrapolated\nfrom the penumbral spines have magnetic fields that are more vertical than those of their\nsurroundings (Kubo et al. 2007a). Such MMFs appear to be formed as a result of the detachment of a fraction of the magnetic field from the penumbral spines.\nThe net magnetic flux transported by all the MMFs exceeds the flux-loss rate of the\nsunspot (Mart\u0131\u0301nez Pillet 2002; Kubo et al. 2007a). Hence, it has been suggested that the\nMMFs detached from the penumbral spines alone are the agent that removes magnetic\nflux from the sunspot (e.g., Shine & Title 2001; Mart\u0131\u0301nez Pillet 2002; Thomas et al. 2002;\nWeiss et al. 2004). Those MMFs might carry away an amount of magnetic flux sufficient to\naccount for the flux loss of the sunspot (Kubo et al. 2007a). If so, the formation of those\nMMFs that detach from the penumbral spines is more important to the process of sunspot\ndecay than that of other types of MMFs.\nKubo et al. (2007b) found that bright features (granules) appear where an MMF is\nseparating from the penumbral spine, but only one event was examined in detail in that\nwork. Using observations of two mature sunspots made by the Solar Optical Telescope\n(SOT; Tsuneta et al. 2008; Suematsu et al. 2008; T. D. Tarbell et al. 2008 in preparation;\nIchimoto et al. 2008; Shimizu et al. 2008a) aboard the Hinode satellite (Kosugi et al. 2007),\nwe build statistics of the comparison between MMFs detaching from the spines and both\nbright and dark features around the penumbral outer boundary. The Hinode SOT reveals\nthe evolution of fine structures in both the penumbra and the moat region from continuous\nobservations with a spatial resolution of 0.2\u2032\u2032 \u2212 0.3\u2032\u2032 .\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n2.\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nWe focus on SOT observations of two mature sunspots that were located near the disk\ncenter in order to be able to clearly identify the penumbral spines and intra-spines with lineof-sight magnetograms. These sunspots are typical decaying sunspots that have a nearly\ncircular shape. The data sets used in this study are summarized in Table 1. We use the\nobservations of the sunspot in NOAA Active Region (AR) 10933 to investigate temporal\nevolution in the G-band intensity and line-of-sight magnetic fields in the photosphere over a\nlarge field of view. The temporal evolution of the vector magnetic field is obtained by the\nHinode Spectropolarimeter (SP) for the sunspot in NOAA AR 10944. These data complement the G-band sequences with quantitative measures of the vector field, but over a small\nfield of view.\n\n2.1.\n\nActive Region NOAA 10933\n\nThe filtergram (FG) of the SOT obtained sunspot images continuously in NOAA AR\n10933 with a 2 minute cadence from 16:14 to 24:00 on 2007 January 4, and with a 7 minute\ncadence from 0:00 to 4:00 on 2007 January 5. The broadband filter imager (BFI) provided\nG-band 4305 \u00c5 and Ca II H 3968 \u00c5 images over the full field of view (223\u2032\u2032 \u00d7112\u2032\u2032 ). The\nnarrowband filter imager (NFI) observed the intensity (Stokes I ) and circular polarization\n(Stokes V ) at -120 m\u00c5 from the center of the photospheric line Fe I 6302.5 \u00c5 with the\nfull field of view (328\u2032\u2032 \u00d7164\u2032\u2032 ). The filtergram images were binned 2\u00d72 pixels from the full\nresolution in this observation. The size of a binned pixel was 0.108\u2032\u2032 for the BFI and 0.16\u2032\u2032\nfor the NFI, respectively.\nThe SP obtained a spatial distribution of the full polarization state (Stokes I, Q, U,\nand V ) with the Fast Map mode from 18:40 to 19:43. Having SP observations of the\nfull polarization state permitted us to infer the magnetic field vector and thermodynamic\nparameters in the photosphere. In the Fast Map mode, the slit-scanning step was 0.297\u2032\u2032 ,\nand a pixel sampling along the slit was 0.320\u2032\u2032 . The field of view was 297\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 164\u2032\u2032 . The\nStokes profiles of two magnetically sensitive Fe lines at 6301.5 and 6302.5 \u00c5 were obtained\nsimultaneously with a wavelength sampling of 21.6 m\u00c5 and an integration time of 3.2 seconds\nfor each slit position. Repeated observations for an area of 3.9\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 82\u2032\u2032 were also carried out\nfrom 21:57 to 22:50. The evolution of the magnetic fields in this small area was reported in\nKubo et al. (2007b).\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n2.2.\n\nActive Region NOAA 10944\n\nThe sunspot in NOAA AR 10944 was observed simultaneously with the FG and the SP\nfor 6 hr from 11:51 on 2007 February 27. The BFI provided full-resolution images for the\nG-band and the Ca II H line with a field of view of 56\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 56\u2032\u2032 . The NFI observed the Stokes\nI and V of the photospheric line Fe I 6302.5 \u00c5 in the shutterless mode, in which continuous\nreadout was performed for the central area of the CCD and the outer parts of the CCD were\nmasked. The polarization accuracy was better in the shutterless mode, but the field of view\nwas narrow (32\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 81\u2032\u2032 ). The time cadence of the BFI and NFI was 1 minute.\nThe SP repeatedly scanned the same region of 9.5\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 82\u2032\u2032 with the Normal Map mode.\nIn the Normal Map mode, the spatial sampling was 0.149\u2032\u2032\u00d7 0.160\u2032\u2032, and the integration time\nfor each slit position was 4.8 seconds. The SP took about 5.5 minutes to obtain each map.\n\n3.\n\nDATA ANALYSIS\n3.1.\n\nFiltergrams\n\nThe standard calibrations, which were dark subtraction, flat-fielding, and bad pixel\ncorrection, were performed for the G-band images with the BFI. Only dark subtraction was\napplied for the Stokes I images with the NFI, because flat-fielding data for the NFI images\nwere not yet available for these data sets. Hereafter, we denote the Stokes V image divided\nby the Stokes I image obtained at the same time as a \"line-of-sight magnetogram.\" The effect\nof flat-fielding on the line-of-sight magnetogram is small. Image cross-correlation allowed us\nto align the calibrated G-band images to a reference image in order to remove the drift due\nto the correlation tracker (Shimizu et al. 2008a) and the sunspot proper motion. The image\ntaken at the time of the midpoint of all the G-band images was used as the reference. The\nline-of-sight magnetograms (Stokes V/I ) were aligned to the G-band images that were taken\nat the time closest to the time of the NFI observations via cross-correlation of the G-band\nto the Stokes I images.\nOn the G-band image for NOAA AR 10933, Figure 1 shows the locations that we\ndetermined for the time-averaged penumbral outer boundary, the geometrical center of the\nsunspot, and the reference frame for the position angles around the sunspot center. The\nimage averaged over all the G-band images was used to evaluate the average intensities of\nthe quiet area, the penumbral outer boundary, and the central area of the sunspot. The quietarea intensity (I0 ) was determined by a Gaussian fit to the distribution of the intensities for\npixels located well outside the sunspot. We spatially smoothed the averaged G-band image\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nwith a box of 5\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 5\u2032\u2032 to remove local fluctuations due to penumbral fine structure. Let IG be\nthe smoothed G-band intensity. We then define the average penumbral outer boundary as\nthe locus of IG = 0.87I0 . In NOAA AR 10933, the sunspot center was chosen as the center\nof gravity (COG) of the I0 \u2212 IG image for the entire sunspot. For NOAA AR 10944, we use\nthe COG of the I0 \u2212 IG image for the umbra (IG < 0.4) only because the images did not\ncover the entire penumbral area.\nWe used only the southern part for the sunspot in NOAA AR 10933, because a largest\nbubble was stably located at the top of the NFI images (T. D. Tarbell et al. 2008, in\npreparation). The southern part of the sunspot appeared to be clean.\n\n3.2.\n\nSpectropolarimeter\n\nWe performed the following calibrations for the Stokes profiles observed with the SP:\n(1) dark subtraction and flat-fielding, (2) the polarization calibration induced by the optical\nelements in the SOT, (3) the correction in the direction of spectral dispersion, (4) merging\nof two orthogonal polarizations simultaneously measured with the left and right segments of\nthe CCD, (5) the correction for spectral curvature, (6) compensation for residual crosstalk\nI \u2192 QUV, (7) the correction for the orbital shift in the wavelength and slit directions due\nto the thermal flexure of the Focal Plane Package (FPP; T. D. Tarbell et al. 2008, in\npreparation), and (8) an intensity correction due to the slit width variation along the slit.\nAfter the calibration, vector magnetic fields were derived with a least-squares fitting (\"Stokes\ninversion\") that assumed a Milne-Eddington representation of the atmospheric stratification\n(T. Yokoyama et al. 2008, in preparation). Of the 13 parameters obtained with the Stokes\ninversion, we consider only the field strength (|B|), the inclination angle relative to the line\nof sight (\u03b3), and the filling factor (f ). The magnetic field maps thus obtained were aligned\nto the G-band images taken at the time closest to the midpoint of the SP maps, using\ncross-correlation of the SP continuum intensity map with the BFI G-band images.\nOne must resolve the 180\u25e6 ambiguity of the azimuth angle in order to calculate the\ninclination with respect to the normal to the solar surface. We first select the line-of-sight\nazimuth closest to the potential field computed using the line-of-sight component of the\nmagnetic field as a boundary condition. Then we interactively determined the azimuth to\nreduce discontinuities of azimuth and inclination angles by using the AZAM utility (written\nin IDL by P. Seagraves; Lites et al. 1995), which allowed us to display and select the two\nalternatives for the azimuth angle. Both the sunspots were located near the disk center, so\nany errors in the inclination arising from the wrong choice of the ambiguous azimuth will\namount to less than 15\u25e6 . In any event, an erroneous choice of azimuth is rare for symmetric\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nsunspots such as those studied here.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nRESULTS\n\nMagnetic Fields of Bright/Dark Features in the Outer Penumbra\n\nThe penumbra consists of many radial structures, and MMFs usually move radially\noutward from the outer penumbral edge. Figure 2 displays on the vertical axis the radial\ndistance from the averaged penumbral outer boundary, and on the horizontal axis, the position angle around the sunspot center. The contours in Figure 2 enclose features brighter\nin the G band than 0.87I0. Many of the features enclosed by the contours in Figure 2a may\nbe found in the middle and outer penumbra. Some of these correspond to stronger positive\nline-of-sight fields (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, Figure 2c demonstrates that the enclosed radial\nstructures have magnetic fields that are more vertical than those of their surroundings. The\nline-of-sight direction is nearly normal to the solar surface in this case. Therefore, we can\nassign the white and gray areas in the outer penumbra of Figure 2b as the vertical (spine)\ncomponent and the horizontal (intra-spine) component of the penumbral magnetic fields, respectively. We can also identify the patchy magnetic elements in Figure 2b that have intense\nwhite and black areas in the moat region as MMFs with vertical fields.\nBright features in the G-band images usually have a radially elongated structure. Langhans et al.\n(2005) showed, using the finest spatial resolution (0.2\u2032\u2032 ) ever achieved, that bright penumbral\nfilaments have more vertical magnetic fields than those of dark penumbral filaments in the\nouter penumbra. We confirm this relationship using spectropolarimetric measurements with\na spatial resolution of 0.3\u2032\u2032 .\n\n4.2.\n\nMMFs Separating from the Penumbra\n\nWe find a clear correspondence between MMFs separating from the penumbral spines\nand convective motions in the outer penumbra. Figure 3 shows a time series of G-band\nimages and line-of-sight magnetograms around the position angle of 212\u25e6 (indicated by the\nvertical lines in Fig. 2). A penumbral spine appears in the frame at 18:46, as shown by\nthe arrow pointing to the left, and it elongates radially outward. In the same period, a\nbright elongated structure appears in the G-band image, and its brightest area also moves\noutward with the elongating penumbral spine. The elongating spine connects with an existing\nmagnetic element (indicated by the arrow pointing to the right) from 19:46 to 20:46, and\nthe outer part of the elongating spine becomes large in this period. The outer part of the\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nelongating spine is gradually separating from the main body of the spine, and then this\npart becomes an MMF in the frame at 23:46. We find that granules appear in the outer\npenumbra when the outer edge of the elongating spine reaches the penumbra outer boundary\n(see the 21:46 frame). Such granules continuously appear one after another while the MMF\nis detaching from the spine.\nFigure 4 shows the temporal change of the G-band intensity and the line-of-sight magnetic field along a radial line at the position angle of 212\u25e6 . Two kinds of magnetic elements\nwith outward motion can be seen from the outer penumbra to the inner moat region, as\nreported in Zhang et al. (2007a): fuzzy, small magnetic elements move quickly, and large\nmagnetic elements move slowly. There is no significant G-band bright feature in the outer\nand middle penumbra, and only the fuzzy magnetic elements are visible there in the first\n2 hr. Then, a bright feature appears around 18:00 on January 4 and moves toward the\nmoat region with an elongating large magnetic element, which corresponds to the elongating\npenumbral spine shown in Figure 3. The bright feature divides into two features around\n19:00: one moves toward the umbra (the upward arrow in Fig. 4a), and the other moves outward with the elongating spine to become an MMF (downward arrow). The bright feature\nmoving outward disappears around 20:00, and another bright feature subsequently appears\n20 minutes later at a position similar to where the previous feature disappeared. This new\nbright feature also moves outward with the elongating spine. The outer edge of the spine\narrives at the penumbral outer boundary around 22:00, and as a result of the appearance of\ngranules in the outer penumbra, the penumbral outer boundary retracts toward the umbra\nrelative to its average position. The bright feature moving with the elongating spine merges\nwith the appearing granules. The outer part of the elongating spine is completely separated\nfrom the penumbra around 00:00, and this part still moves outward as an MMF. The elongating speed of the spine averaged over 6 hr after its appearance is about 0.2 km s\u22121 , which\nis similar to the horizontal velocities of MMFs that have vertical magnetic fields with the\nsame polarity as that of the sunspot around the penumbral outer boundary (Kubo et al.\n2007a). There are many bright features moving inward and outward in the penumbra before\n00:00 on January 5, but most of the bright features and the elongating spine disappear from\nthe outer penumbra after the MMF separates from the penumbral spine.\nThe relationship between the MMF separating from the elongated spine and convection\nin the outer penumbra is demonstrated above for only the radial line at the position angle of\n212\u25e6 . To confirm that this relationship is common all around the penumbral outer boundary,\nwe compare the temporal change in the G-band intensity to the line-of-sight magnetic field\nat 2\u2032\u2032 inside the penumbral outer boundary for position angles ranging from 180\u25e6 to 360\u25e6 in\nFigure 5. There are many bright streaks in Figure 5a. These bright streaks represent the\ngranules appearing in the outer penumbra or the penumbral bright features moving outward.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nOn the other hand, the positive magnetic features in Figure 5b mostly correspond to the\nelongating spines or the MMFs detaching from the spines. We confirm that the G-band bright\nstreaks are generally located at the elongating spines or at the detaching MMFs, as shown\nby the contours in Figure 5. This tendency is more clearly seen in the limb-side penumbra\n(the left-hand side of Fig. 5) than in the center-side penumbra due to the projection effect.\nSome bright features are not located at positive magnetic features but at negative magnetic features with weak magnetic fields (darker features than their surroundings; see the\ngreen boxes in Fig. 5). The bright features in the outer penumbra are related to formation\nof the MMFs that have the polarity opposite to that of the sunspot.\n\n4.3.\n\nDark Penumbral Filament Elongating to the Moat Region\n\nThe outer boundary of the penumbra fluctuates around its average position, and dark\npenumbral filaments often elongate into the moat region. Such dark filaments correspond\nto the areas with strong horizontal fields that extend from the penumbra. The arrows in\nFigure 6 indicate the evolution of three dark, elongating penumbral filaments with strong\nhorizontal fields in NOAA AR 10944. The longer dark penumbral filaments extend to the\nouter moat region. The MMFs with the polarity opposite to that of the sunspot are located\nat the outer edge of the filamentary structure with strong horizontal fields. This is consistent with the result of Kubo et al. (2007b). The dotted circles in the rightmost frames\nof Figures 6b and 6c indicate that two MMFs with positive polarity and two MMFs with\nnegative polarity are aligned along each of two filamentary structures that have a strong\nhorizontal field (the middle circles each contain two MMFs that have opposite polarities).\nThis is clear evidence that bipolar MMFs correspond to the intersections of the solar surface\nwith serpentine horizontal fields extending from the penumbra. In this case, each serpentine\nhorizontal field line consists of both \u03a9-loops and U-loops (see Fig. 8b). This means that\nwhether bipolar MMFs form \u03a9-loops or U-loops depends on which segments of the extended\npenumbral fields are chosen, as well as on the number of intersections. The bipolar MMFs\nwith a U-loop may correspond to a localized dip of the magnetic canopy, as proposed by\nZhang et al. (2003).\nFigure 7 shows the temporal change in the G-band intensity and the line-of-sight magnetic field at 1\u2032\u2032 outside the penumbral outer boundary of NOAA AR 10933. The dark\npenumbral filaments elongating to the moat region are indicated by the dark features in\nFigure 7a. The appearance and disappearance of the long positive magnetic features in\nFigure 7b are mainly due to the outward motion of MMFs that detach from the penumbral\nspines. The elongating dark filaments (red contours in Fig. 7b) are usually located at the\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nareas that have nearly horizontal magnetic fields with respect to the solar surface (gray or\nweak white areas in Fig. 7b). We find that most of the elongating dark filaments are adjacent to the MMFs that have the same polarity as the sunspot. This means that the dark\npenumbral filaments elongate near the MMFs that have the same polarity as the sunspot\nwhen such MMFs separate from the penumbra. One example of such a dark penumbral\nfilament and an MMF can be seen at 22:46 in Figure 3.\n\n5.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe SOT allows us to perform continuous observations with high spatial resolution for a\nduration longer than the typical lifetime of MMFs. The results regarding flux removal from\nthe sunspot in this study are summarized as follows (see also Fig. 8):\n1. G-band bright features in the outer penumbra are located at the elongating spines or\nat the MMFs detaching from the spines. G-band bright features moving both outward\nand inward can be found in the middle and outer penumbra. The penumbral spines\nelongate toward the moat region in concert with the outward motions of the penumbral\nbright features.\n2. Granules appear in the outer penumbra at locations where MMFs that have the same\npolarity as the sunspot separate from the penumbral spines. Such granules often merge\nwith bright features moving along the elongating spines.\n3. Dark penumbral filaments frequently elongate into the moat region, and longer ones\nreach the outer moat region. The elongating dark penumbral filaments coincide with\nfilamentary structures that have strong horizontal fields that extend outward from\nthe penumbra. We present clear examples of bipolar MMFs indicating a serpentine\nfield with multiple intersections with the solar photosphere. MMFs with positive and\nnegative polarities are located along the filamentary structures with strong horizontal\nfields.\n4. The MMFs that are detached from the penumbral spines are usually observed in the\nneighborhood of the elongating dark penumbral filaments.\nThe total flux transport rate by the MMFs that are detached from the penumbral spines\nis greater than the flux-loss rate of the sunspot (Kubo et al. 2007a). Therefore, items 1 and\n2 above confirm that convection in the outer penumbra is related to the flux removal of the\nsunspot (Kubo et al. 2007b). However, the magnetic energy density of the penumbral fields is\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nlarger than the kinetic energy density of the penumbral bright features at the photospheric\nsurface. Converging and downward flows are inferred in the subsurface convection zone\naround a stable sunspot (Zhao et al. 2001), and such flows might be essential to the formation\nand sustenance of sunspots (Meyer et al. 1974; Parker 1979, 1992). The appearance of the\nbright features moving outward in the outer penumbra suggests subsurface upwelling and\ndiverging flows. Such flows would work against the stabilization of the sunspot, and recent\nMHD simulations showed that magnetic flux is carried away from the spot by subsurface\ndiverging flows (Heinemann et al. 2007). Meyer et al. (1974) suggested that small flux tubes\ndiffuse out into the moat region by small scale convection beneath the sunspot. The fact\nthat the bright features and granules appear in the outer penumbra at the location of the\nelongating spines (that subsequently become MMFs) supports this idea.\nAnother possibility is that Evershed flows detach penumbral flux and advect it into\nthe moat region. Evershed flows with supersonic velocities are often observed around the\npenumbral outer boundary (Shimizu et al. 2008b). Supersonic flows are also observed in\nconnection with horizontal fields extending from the penumbra (Kubo et al. 2007b). The\nkinetic energy density of such supersonic flows is larger than the magnetic energy density\nof the magnetic fields in the outer penumbra. Nevertheless, the Hinode SP observations\nof vector magnetic fields with 0.3\u2032\u2032 resolution have confirmed that the Evershed flows are\nradial outward flows along those penumbral filaments that have nearly horizontal fields\n(Ichimoto et al. 2007). Detachment of the MMFs is observed when the penumbral horizontal fields elongate into the moat region. This means that Evershed flows are related not\nonly to the formation of the bipolar MMFs located along the extending penumbral horizontal\nfields, but also to the detachment of the MMFs from the penumbral spines. The Evershed\nflows originate at penumbral bright features that are moving inward in the inner penumbra (Rimmele & Marino 2006; Ichimoto et al. 2007), and the detachment of MMFs from the\npenumbra is observed with penumbral bright features that are moving outward in the outer\npenumbra. This suggests the possibility that both Evershed flows and the detachment of\nMMFs originate from the activity of convection below the sunspot penumbra. The relationship between Evershed flows and sunspot decay also should be investigated using Doppler\nand magnetic field measurements of both high spatial and high temporal resolution.\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the late Professor T.

The vertical axis shows the radial distance from the penumbral outer boundary, and\nthe horizontal axis shows the position angle around the sunspot center. These panels are\nmade from the observations of NOAA AR 10933 on 2007 January 4. Each pixel in panels\na and b was aligned to the time and position closest to those of each pixel in panel c. The\nG-band intensity is normalized to the quiet-area intensity. The contours represent a G-band\nintensity of 0.87. White (black) indicates positive (negative) polarity in panel b. An inclination of 90\u25e6 corresponds to magnetic fields directed perpendicular to the local vertical, and\ninclinations of 0\u25e6 and 180\u25e6 represent magnetic fields directed away from the solar surface and\nmagnetic fields directed toward the surface, respectively. The horizontal solid line shows the\naveraged outer boundary of the penumbra. The horizontal dashed and dash-dotted lines in\npanels a and b represent distances of 2\u2032\u2032 inside and 1\u2032\u2032 outside the outer penumbral boundary,\nrespectively. The vertical solid line in panels a and b shows the position angle of 212\u25e6 .\n\n\fdistance from penumbral edge [arcsec]\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n(a) BFI G-band\n17:46:03\n\n18:46:04\n\n19:46:06\n\n20:46:07\n\n21:46:07\n\n22:46:09\n\n23:46:10\n\n1.1\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-8\n202\n\n0.6\n212\n\n222 202\n\n212\n\n222 202\n\n212\n\n222 202\n\n212\n\n222 202\n\n212\n\n222 202\n\n212\n\n222 202\n\n212\n\n222\n\ndistance from penumbral edge [arcsec]\n\nposition angle (counterclockwise from west) [degree]\n\n(b) NFI line-of-sight magnetogram (Stokes V/I)\n17:46:09\n\n18:46:10\n\n19:46:12\n\n20:46:13\n\n21:46:14\n\n22:46:16\n\n23:46:17\n\n+0.04\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-8\n202\n\n-0.04\n212\n\n222 202\n\n212\n\n222 202\n\n212\n\n222 202\n\n212\n\n222 202\n\n212\n\n222 202\n\n212\n\n222 202\n\n212\n\n222\n\nposition angle (counterclockwise from west) [degree]\n\nFig. 3.- Time series of (a) G-band images and (b) line-of-sight magnetograms for position\nangles in the range 202\u25e6 \u2212222\u25e6 on 2007 January 4.
