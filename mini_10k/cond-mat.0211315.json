INTRODUCTION\n\nOne of the remarkable phenomena of mesoscopic physics is the existence of equilibrium\npersistent currents in small normal metal rings, in the regime where the elastic mean free\npath l is much smaller than the ring's circumference L. This was both predicted theoretically [1] and observed experimentally. [2,3,4,5,6,7] For the ensemble-averaged persistent\ncurrent, the experimental results [2,5,6,7] are much larger than the value obtained using the\nmodel of noninteracting electrons, [8,9] and show predominantly diamagnetic response at\nzero flux. In an attempt to resolve this discrepancy, the contribution of electron-electron\n\n1\n\n\f(\"e-e\") interactions was calculated [10] and it was later suggested that the diamagnetic response is due to effective attractive e-e interactions. [11] Though indeed the inclusion of e-e\ninteractions increased the theoretical value, it was still smaller by a factor of about 5 than\nthe experimental results, for both repulsive and attractive interactions. [11]\nIn a recent work [13] we suggested that the contribution of high energy levels (denoted\n\"far levels\"), further than the Thouless energy ETh from the Fermi energy EF , results in an\nenhanced orbital magnetic response (the derivative of the persistent current at zero flux).\nThis was shown for the model of attractive pairing interactions described by the reduced\nBCS Hamiltonian, by doing perturbation theory in both the magnetic field and the e-e\ninteraction. In this paper we repeat the calculation for the same model, doing perturbation\ntheory in the magnetic field only, using the exact many-body states of the system with e-e\ninteractions. In this way we can treat on the same footing different regimes of the strength\nof the interaction. We consider briefly the limits of zero interaction and the opposite limit\nwhere the interaction is strong enough and the system is superconducting. We then treat in\nmore detail the case of weak e-e interaction, using Richardson's exact solution for the reduced\nBCS Hamiltonian. [14,15] In this way we obtain [see Eq. (18)] the result of Ref. [II] as a\nleading order expansion of an exact solution, instead of first order perturbation theory in the\ninteraction. Furthermore, the present derivation has the merit of emphasizing the connection\nbetween the enhanced magnetic response and the pairing correlations of all the levels up\nto the high energy cutoff at the Debye frequency \u03c9D . These correlations exist in the exact\nmany-body ground state (g.s.) of the ring [see Eqs. (14),(15) and discussion after Eq. (16)].\nThe contribution of the pairing correlations of the far levels was first realized in connection\nto superconductivity in small grains. [16] There it was shown that this contribution results\nin a much larger condensation energy than that given by the BCS theory in a large regime\nin which superconducting correlations are well developed, as well as in a correction to the\nspin magnetization and susceptibility as function of magnetic field H that persists up to\nH = \u03c9D /\u03bcB .\n\n2\n\n\fII. MAGNETIC RESPONSE\n\nWe consider a quasi one dimensional disordered ring with a finite number of electrons\nNe , penetrated by a constant Aharonov Bohm (AB) flux in its middle. We take the case of\nzero temperature, and the average spacing between noninteracting energy levels is d. The\nHamiltonian is given by\nH=\n\nXZ\n\ndr \u03c8\u03b1\u2020 (r)\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u0014\n\n1 ~ e~ 2\n(P \u2212 A) + U(r) \u03c8\u03b1 (r) + Hee\n2m\nc\n\u0015\n\n(1)\n\nwhere U(r) is the external potential which includes the disorder, and Hee represents the e-e\ninteractions. The vector potential corresponding to the AB flux \u03a6 in the middle of the ring\n~ = \u03a6/(2\u03c0\u03c1)\u03c6\u0302, where \u03c1 is the distance from the origin and\nis given in the London gauge by A\nthe angle \u03c6\u0302 is in the clockwise direction of the ring. The ground state energy of the system\nis flux dependent, and can be written for small flux as\n1\nE(\u03a6) = E0 \u2212 E2 \u03a62 + ...\n2\n\n(2)\n\nThe persistent current is given by I = \u2212dE/d\u03a6. [17] Since, due to time reversal symmetry\nthere is no linear term of the energy as function of flux, hence I(0) = 0 and dI/d\u03a6 |\u03a6=0 = E2 .\nSince we are interested in E2 , we calculate the ground state energy of the system to\nsecond order in the flux. We take as the unperturbed Hamiltonian\nH0 =\n\nXZ\n\ndr \u03c8\u03b1\u2020 (r)\n\n\u03b1\n\n\"\n\nP2\n+ U(r) \u03c8\u03b1 (r) + Hee\n2m\n#\n\n(3)\n\nand the magnetic field represented by the vector potential as perturbation\nHI =\n\nXZ\n\u03b1\n\ndr \u03c8\u03b1\u2020 (r)\n\ne ~ ~ ~ ~\ne2\n\u2212\n(P * A + A * P ) +\nA2 \u03c8\u03b1 (r) .\n2\n2mc\n2mc\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n(4)\n\nWe assume that the width of the ring is much smaller than its circumference L. [18]\nThen the A2 term gives the \"diamagnetic\" contribution,\n1 e\u03a6\n2 mcL\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\nN\u0302 ,\n\nwhich is independent of the e-e interactions and results in\n3\n\n(5)\n\n\fE2dia\n\ne\u03a6\n=\u2212\nmcL\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\nNe .\n\n(6)\n\nWe denote by |ii the eigenstates of the noninteracting electrons in the disordered ring\nwithout magnetic field. In this basis the first and relevant term of HI is\nHI1 = \u2212\n\nX\nij\u03b1\n\ne\u03a6\nPij c\u2020i\u03b1 cj\u03b1 .\nmcL\n\n(7)\n\nHere ci destroys an electron in the state |ii with wavefunction \u03c7i (r) and Pij = hi|Pk |ji is the\nmatrix element of the momentum parallel to the ring's direction. We choose the \u03c7i 's to be\nreal, and then Pij is pure imaginary and Pii = 0. Using second order perturbation theory in\nHI1 we write the paramagnetic part of E2 as\nE2par\n\ne\n= \u22122\nmcL\n\u0012\n\n\u00132 X X\n\nI ijkl,\u03b1\u03b1\u2032\n\nD\n\ng.s.|Pij c\u2020i\u03b1 cj\u03b1 |I\n\nED\n\nI|Pkl c\u2020k\u03b1\u2032 cl\u03b1\u2032 |g.s.\n\nEg.s. \u2212 EI\n\nE\n\n(8)\n\nwhere EI are the energies of the intermediate states |Ii. We model the e-e interactions by\nthe reduced BCS interaction\nHee = \u2212\u03bbd\n\nX\n\n\u2032 \u2020 \u2020\nci\u2191 ci\u2193 cj\u2193 cj\u2191\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nij\n\nwhere \u03bb is the dimensionless pairing parameter and the sum is over all levels with energies\nbetween EF \u2212 \u03c9D and EF + \u03c9D . This interaction Hamiltonian is the usual one used when\ndiscussing superconducting grains, both in the perturbative and nonperturbative regimes\n[19] and its validity is discussed in, e.g. Refs. [II,II,II]. (In particular, for the model to\nbe valid the grain's dimensionless conductance g must be much larger than one.) In this\nmodel the ground state has no singly occupied noninteracting states [14,15] (we assume, for\nsimplicity, that the number of electrons in the ring is even). Therefore, |Ii has two singly\noccupied states, with opposite spins. We denote by Imn the set of many-body states where\nstate m(n) in occupied with one electron with spin up (down). Eq. (8) can then be written\nas\nE2par\n\ne\n= \u22122\nmcL\n\u0012\n\n\u00132 X X\n\n|Pmn |\n\nmn I\u2208Imn\n\n4\n\n2\n\nD\n\nI|c\u2020m\u2191 cn\u2191 \u2212 c\u2020n\u2193 cm\u2193 |g.s.\nEg.s. \u2212 EI\n\nE\n\n2\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\n\fWe now analyze this equation for the cases of \u03bb = 0 (normal metal), \u03bb > 1/ ln N\n(superconductor, see Ref. [II]), and 0 < \u03bb \u226a 1/ ln N (weak attractive interactions). Here\nN \u2261 \u03c9D /d.\nFor \u03bb = 0 the ground state is the noninteracting Fermi state, and the only relevant\nintermediate states are those with one electron-hole pair (the lowest energy states within\neach subspace Imn ). A straightforward calculation results in\npar(n)\nE2\n\n2e\n=\nmcL\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n|Pmn |2\nm>0,n<0 \u03c9mn\nX\n\n(11)\n\nwhere m > 0 denotes states with energies larger than EF and \u03c9mn = \u01ebm \u2212 \u01ebn , the difference between the energies of the single particle states m and n. For a diffusive ring this\nparamagnetic term is of the same order as the diamagnetic term in Eq. (6). The difference\nbetween these terms is of the order of the contribution of the last level (and can therefore\nhave either sign) and constitutes the noninteracting sample specific result for the magnetic\nresponse. [17]\nThe opposite limit is the superconducting regime. In this regime one can use the BCS\napproximation for the ground and excited states of the system, and the Bogoliubov transformation for the creation and annihilation operators. Eq. (10) is then reduced to\npar(BCS)\nE2\n\ne\n=2\nmcL\n\u0012\n\n|Pmn |2 (um vn \u2212 un vm )2\n.\nEm + En\nm,n\n\n\u00132 X\n\n(12)\n\nHere um , vm are the coherence factors, and Em is the energy of the electron-hole quasiparticle\nof state m. In the ballistic case, Pmn = Pm \u03b4mn and therefore the paramagnetic term is zero.\nThis results in the well known perfect diamagnetism of a superconductor. For the diffusive\ncase the ensemble-averaged momentum matrix elements are given by [13]\nD\n\nE\n\n|Pmn |2 =\n\np2F \u03c4 d\n2 \u03c4 2 )s\n\u03c0(1 + \u03c9mn\n\n(13)\n\nwhich is roughly constant for \u03c9mn < 1/\u03c4 and zero for \u03c9mn > 1/\u03c4 (\u03c4 is the elastic mean free\ntime and s = 1, 2, 3 is the effective dimension of the ring for diffusive motion). The total\nresponse in this case (sum of diamagnetic and paramagnetic terms) is diamagnetic, with an\n5\n\n\fapproximate magnitude of (l/\u03be)E2dia, where \u03be is the (ballistic) superconducting coherence\nlength.\nWe now turn to the calculation of E2par for the case of weak attractive interaction (\u03bb <\n1/ ln N). We calculate the interaction correction to E2 to first order in \u03bb. Using Richardson's\nexact solution [15] one finds that to first order in \u03bb the ground state can be written as\n\u03a8g.s. =\n\nX\n\n\u03c6(f1 ...fN )b\u2020fN ...b\u2020f1 |vaci\n\n(14)\n\n{f1 ...fN }\n\nwith\n\u03c6(1...N) = 1\n\u03c6(1...N; 6= j, k) =\n\n\u03bbd\n.\n2(\u01ebk \u2212 \u01ebj )\n\n(15)\n\nHere (f1 ...fN ) denotes a set of N out of the 2N noninteracting eigenstates between EF \u2212 \u03c9D\nand EF + \u03c9D , b\u2020f1 \u2261 c\u2020f1 \u2191 c\u2020f1 \u2193 and \u03c6(1...N; 6= j, k) is the amplitude of the many-body state\nwith a filled Fermi sea except a pair excitation from state j below EF to state k above\nEF . To first order in \u03bb, the amplitude of all the other possible configurations is zero for\nthe ground state. The finite amplitude to occupy noninteracting states with energies larger\nthan EF is a result of the interaction. For any small \u03bb the system gains energy by having\na different ground state than the Fermi state. Note that the amplitudes of all the different\nconfigurations come with the same sign. Similar analysis of the intermediate states shows\nl\nthat the only intermediate states that contribute to E2 in first order in \u03bb are Imn\n, the lowest\n\nenergy states of each subspace Imn , with m and n on opposite sides and within \u03c9D of the\nFermi surface. Then\nD\n\nE\n\nl\nImn\n|c\u2020m\u2191 cn\u2191 \u2212 c\u2020n\u2193 cm\u2193 |g.s. = 1 \u2212\n\n\u03bbd\n2\u03c9mn\n\n(16)\n\nand Eg.s. \u2212EI = \u03c9mn +\u03bbd. Thus, the pairing interaction contributes to the magnetic response\nin two ways. First, due to the finite occupancy of levels above EF the matrix element in\nEq. (16) has a contribution not only from the annihilation of an electron in state n below\nEF and the creation of an electron in state m above EF . Since in the ground state there is a\n6\n\n\ffinite amplitude for state m to be doubly occupied and state n to be empty, there is a finite\ncontribution to the matrix element from annihilating and electron in state m above EF and\ncreating it in state n below EF [second term in Eq. (16)]. Second, it adds a term \u03bbd to the\nenergy of the excited states due to the excess pairing energy of a doubly occupied state.\nThe latter term is a Hartree-like contribution, coming from the diagonal part of the pairing\ninteraction, while the former is due to pairing correlations of pairs in different single-particle\nstates [offdiagonal part of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (9)]. Both of these contributions suppress\nthe paramagnetic term in the case of attractive interaction, and as a result, to first order in\n\u03bb,\npar(fo)\nE2\n\n=\n\npar(n)\nE2\n\n2e\n\u2212 \u03bbd\nmcL\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n|Pmn |2\n.\n2\nm>0,n<0 \u03c9mn\nX\n\n(17)\n\nUsing Eq. (13) we find that the derivative of the persistent current at zero flux, to first order\nin the interaction, is given by\nD\n\nE\n\nE2fo =\n\n8\u03c0\u03bbETh \u03c9D\nln\n.\n\u03a620\nd\n\n(18)\n\nIn comparison with the known result for the first order interaction correction to the magnetic response [10], our result has a much larger logarithmic cutoff, \u03c9D compared with ETh .\nThis enhancement is irrespective of the higher order correction, which for attractive interaction further increases the first order result. [11] The large logarithm we obtain is a result\nof enhanced pairing correlations of all the states within 1/\u03c4 from EF . We expect that semiclassically this term necessitates only one circulation of the ring, and will therefore affect\nthe magnitude of the persistent current as well (see discussion in Ref. [II]). This may lead\nto a resolution of the discrepancy between the experimental results and theory of persistent\ncurrents in diffusive normal rings.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe benefited from valuable discussions with N.
