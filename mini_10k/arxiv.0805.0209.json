The\nproofs are based on the study of special radicals on the class of Banach algebras.\n\n1. Introduction and preliminaries\nIn 1960 Rota and Strang [6] introduced the notion of spectral radius for sets of\noperators or, more generally, of elements of a Banach algebra. Namely, if M is a\nbounded subset of a Banach algebra A, the joint spectral radius \u03c1(M ) is defined by\n(1.1)\n\n\u03c1(M ) = lim kM n k\n\n1/n\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n= inf kM n k\n\n1/n\n\nn\n\n,\n\nwhere the norm of a bounded set is the supremum of the norms of its elements,\nand the products of sets are defined elementwise:\nM1 M2 = {ab : a \u2208 M1 , b \u2208 M2 }.\nThe notion turned out to be useful in various branches of mathematics: wavelets,\nevolution dynamics, difference equations and the operator theory itself. In [7] the\njoint spectral radius was applied to show the existence of hyperinvariant subspace for\nevery operator algebra whose Jacobson radical contains non-zero compact operators.\nThis stimulates the interest in convenient ways for the calculation of \u03c1(M ).\nThe map M 7\u2212\u2192 \u03c1(M ) has many convenient algebraic and analytic properties,\nin particular it is subharmonic [8, Theorem 3.5] (for finite M , see also [12, Theorem\n3.8]). The latter means that if M = M (\u03bb) analytically depends on a complex parameter \u03bb under natural conditions then \u03bb 7\u2212\u2192 \u03c1(M (\u03bb)) is a subharmonic function.\nThe following property [8, Corollary 2.10] is quite important (see also a stronger\nresult in [12, Proposition 3.5]).\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

SHULMAN AND YURI V. TUROVSKII\n\nLemma 1.1. If \u03c1(M ) = 0 then all elements in the subalgebra generated by M are\nquasinilpotent.\nA very useful formula for the joint spectral radius of a bounded set of matrices\nwas found in 1992 by M. A. Berger and Y. Wang [1]. To formulate it we introduce,\nfollowing to [1], another spectral characteristics of a bounded subset M of a Banach\nalgebra:\n1/n\nr(M ) = lim sup (sup {\u03c1(a) : a \u2208 M n })\n.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nIt is clear that\nr(M ) \u2264 \u03c1(M ).\nIt was proved in [1] that\n(1.2)\n\nr(M ) = \u03c1(M )\n\nfor any bounded set of matrices. This equality (the Berger-Wang formula) was\nextended in [8] to arbitrary precompact sets of compact operators on Banach spaces.\nIt should be noted that both restrictions of compactness are essential. It is\nproved in [3] that there are two non-compact operators a, b such that\nr({a, b}) = 0 6= \u03c1({a, b}).\nThere are also bounded families of compact operators for which the equality (1.2)\nfails (see for instance [5]).\nThe Berger-Wang formula for compact operators was applied in [8] to the study of\noperator semigroups and Lie algebras. As a simplest example of its application, note\nthat it implies immediately the existence of a nontrivial closed invariant subspace\nfor a semigroup of Volterra (i.e. compact quasinilpotent) operators, established in\n[13].\nIndeed, if G is a semigroup of Volterra operators then for each finite\nsubset M of G, every power M n consists of quasinilpotent operators,\nwhence r(M ) = 0. By (1.2), \u03c1(M ) = 0, whence the linear span of M\nconsists of Volterra operators by Lemma 1.1. Thus the linear span of G\nis an algebra of Volterra operators. By the Lomonosov Theorem [4], it\nhas a nontrivial closed invariant subspace.\n\nOur main aim here is to prove that, for arbitrary precompact set M of operators\non X ,\n(1.3)\n\n\u03c1(M ) = max{r(M ), \u03c1e (M )},\n\nwhere \u03c1e (M ) = \u03c1(\u03c0(M )), the joint spectral radius of the image of M in the Calkin\nalgebra B (X ) /K (X ) under the canonical homomorphism \u03c0.\nWe call (1.3) the generalized Berger-Wang formula. This formula not only extends (1.2) to arbitrary operators, but also gives many additional possibilities for\napplications. Note for example that it implies immediately that (1.2) holds for precompact families of operators of the form \u03bb1 + K, where \u03bb \u2208 C and K is a compact\noperator.\nIndeed, in this case \u03c0(M ) consists of scalar multiples of the unit in the\nCalkin algebra B (X ) /K (X ), whence\n\u03c1e (M ) = r(\u03c0(M )) \u2264 r(M ),\nand (1.3) shows that\n\n\u03c1(M ) \u2264 r(M ).\n\n\fCALCULATION OF JOINT SPECTRAL RADII\n\n3\n\nIn its turn the equality (1.2) for 'scalar plus compact' operators was a main ingredient of the proof (in [8]) that any Lie algebra of compact quasinilpotent operators\nhas a nontrivial closed invariant subspace.\nLet us recall the proof of this result. Let L be a Lie subalgebra in B(X ),\nthat is a subspace of B(X ) such that\n\nT S \u2212 ST \u2208 L\nfor all T, S \u2208 L. If L consists of quasinilpotent operators then\n\nG = {eT : T \u2208 L}\nis a group (Wojty\u0144ski's version of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff Theorem [14]), and all operators in G have spectrum {1}. It follows that\n\nr(M ) = 1\nfor each finite set M \u2282 G. If L consists of compact operators then G\nconsists of operators of the form 1 + K with compact K . By the above,\n\n\u03c1(M ) = 1,\nfor each finite subset M \u2282 G. Choose T \u2208 M and define a function\nf (z) on C by\n\nf (z) = \u03c1(M (ezT \u2212 1)/z).\nIt is subharmonic and tends to zero on infinity because\n\n\u03c1(M (ezT \u2212 1)) \u2264 2\n(use the fact that the joint spectral radius of a bounded set is not\nchanged if pass to closed convex hull of this set). Hence we have\n\nf (z) = 0,\nfor every z \u2208 C. In particular, f (0) = 0 and\n\n\u03c1(T M ) = 0.\nNow, by Lemma 1.1,\n\n\u03c1(T S) = 0\nfor any S \u2208 A, where A is the linear span of G. Since A is an algebra, it has an invariant subspace by Lomonosov's Lemma. But it is\nstraightforward that an invariant subspace for G is invariant for L.\n\nNote that the definition of \u03c1e (M ) can be rewritten as follows\n\u03c1e (M ) = lim sup (sup {kT ke : T \u2208 M n })1/n ,\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere ||T ||e = ||\u03c0(T )|| is the essential norm of T (T 7\u2212\u2192 ||T ||e is a seminorm on\nB (X )). It is somewhat more convenient is to use\no\u00111/n\n\u0010\nn\n.\n\u03c1\u03c7 (M ) = lim sup sup kT k\u03c7 : T \u2208 M n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nHere kT k\u03c7 is the Hausdorff measure of non-compactness for T X1 , where\nX1 = {x \u2208 X : kxk \u2264 1} .\n\n\f4\n\nVICTOR S. SHULMAN AND YURI V. TUROVSKII\n\nIn other words, kT k\u03c7 is the infimum of all such \u03b5 > 0 that T X1 can be covered by\na finite number of balls of radius \u03b5. The advantage of the work with this seminorm\nis that\nkT |Yk\u03c7 \u2264 kT k\u03c7\nand\n(1.4)\n\nkT | (X /Y)k\u03c7 \u2264 kT k\u03c7 ,\n\nwhere T |Y is the restriction of T to an invariant subspace Y and T | (X /Y) is the\noperator induced by T on the quotient space X /Y.\nSo we will prove that\n(1.5)\n\n\u03c1 (M ) = max {r (M ) , \u03c1\u03c7 (M )}\n\nfor any precompact set M of operators. Since\n\u03c1\u03c7 (M ) \u2264 \u03c1e (M ) \u2264 \u03c1(M ),\nthis is a more strong result than (1.3).\nThe formula (1.5) was proved in [10] for operators on reflexive spaces and, more\ngenerally, for weakly compact operators (see a stronger result in [10, Theorem 4.4]).\nIn the present work we are able to remove these restrictions by applying the theory\nof topological radicals initiated by P. G. Dixon [2] and further developed in [11].\nWe heavily use the properties of the radical Rcq defined in [11] in terms of the\njoint spectral radius, and introduce a new topological radical, Rhc , related to the\ncompactness conditions.\nWe combine Banach algebraic and operator theoretic approaches. The first one\nmakes the subject more flexible and allows us to approximate to a needed result\nstep by step, 'removing' more and more large ideals and passing to the quotients\n(this process is simplified by means of the theory of radicals). The second one\nenjoys the possibility to pass to the restrictions of operators to invariant subspaces\nand to quotient spaces (which is especially important for calculation of spectral\nradii). Our main results also have both Banach algebraic and operator theoretic\nnature. We prove first a formula which expresses the joint spectral radius of a\nfamily of elements of a Banach algebra via the Hausdorff radius of a related family\nof multiplication operators (we call this formula the mixed GBWF). It is used to\ndeduce (1.5) (the operator GBWF). Then using (1.5) we obtain an extension of (1.3)\nto general Banach algebras (the Banach algebraic GBWF). The latter formula is of\nthe same form as (1.3), but the ideal K(X ) is changed by the hypocompact radical\nRhc (A) of a Banach algebra A. It should be noted that, for A = B(X ),\nRhc (A) \u2283 K(X )\nand the inclusion is proper for some Banach spaces. Hence the Banach-algebraic\nformula not only extends (1.3) but also strengthens it.\nWe denote by A1 the Banach algebra obtained by adjoining a unit to A (if A\nis unital then we put A1 = A). The term ideal always means a closed two-sided\nideal, and the term operator always means a bounded linear operator. If J is an\nideal of A then by qJ we denote the quotient map from A to A/J. The image of a\nset M \u2282 A under qJ is denoted by either qJ (M ) or, simply, M/J. All spaces are\nassumed to be over the field C. If M is a subset in a Banach space then span M\ndenotes its closed linear span.\n\n\fCALCULATION OF JOINT SPECTRAL RADII\n\n5\n\n2. Auxiliary results\nA natural way from the Banach algebraic setting to the operator one is to use\nmultiplication operators. As usual, for an element a of a Banach algebra A, we\ndenote by La and Ra the operators of the left and right multiplications by a on A\ndefined by\nLa x = ax, Ra x = xa.\nFurthermore, for M, N \u2282 A, let\nLM = {La : a \u2208 M }\nand, similarly,\nRN = {Ra : a \u2208 N }.\nMultiplying these sets of operators, we define LM RN by\nLM RN = {La Rb : a \u2208 M, b \u2208 N }.\nThe joint spectral properties of M are reflected in the properties of the family\nLM RM .\nLemma 2.1. Let M be a bounded set M in a Banach algebra A. Then\n(i) \u03c1(LM RM ) = \u03c1(M )2 .\n(ii) r(LM RM ) = r(M )2 .\nProof. (i) Note first of all that\n\u03c1(M k ) = \u03c1(M )k\n\n(2.1)\n\nfor every bounded subset M of A and integer k. This follows from the facts that\n\u0001m\nM km = M k\n\nand that in (1.1) one can pass to a subsequence under n = mk.\nIt is clear that\nkLM RN k \u2264 kLM kkRN k \u2264 kM kkN k\nfor bounded subsets M and N of A. Also the formula\n(LM RN )n = LM n RN n\nis evident.

Hereditary topological radicals\nWe deal here with a class of topological radicals that have especially convenient\nproperties. A hereditary topological radical on the class of all Banach algebras is\na map P which assigns to each Banach algebra A its ideal P (A) and satisfies the\nfollowing conditions:\n(R1) P (A/P (A)) = 0.\n(R2) P (J) = J \u2229 P (A) for any ideal J of A.\n(R3) f (P (A)) \u2282 P (B) for continuous surjective homomorphism f : A \u2192 B.\n\n\fCALCULATION OF JOINT SPECTRAL RADII\n\n7\n\nIt follows immediately from (R2) that\nP (P (A)) = P (A).\nAn algebra is called P -radical if\nA = P (A).\nIt can be proved (see [11]) that ideals and quotients of P -radical algebras are P radical and that the class of all P -radical algebras is stable with respect to extensions (if J and A/J are P -radical then A is P -radical). We will need a more general\nresult, also proved in [11].\nLet us call a transfinite increasing sequence (J\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2264\u03b3 of ideals in a Banach algebra\nA a transfinite increasing chain of ideals if J\u03b2 = \u222a\u03b1<\u03b2 J\u03b1 for any limit ordinal \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b3.\nLemma 3.1. Let P be a hereditary topological radical. If in a transfinite increasing\nchain of ideals (J\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2264\u03b3 of a Banach algebra A the first element J1 and all quotients\nJ\u03b1+1 /J\u03b1 are P -radical then J\u03b3 is P -radical.\nThe most popular example of a hereditary topological radical is the Jacobson\nradical Rad. We need some other examples.\n3.1. The radical Rcq . All definitions and results of this subsection are from [11].\nThe topological radical we are going to treat now is related to the joint spectral\nradius. Let us call a Banach algebra A compactly quasinilpotent if \u03c1(M ) = 0 for\nany precompact subset M of A.\nTheorem 3.2. In any Banach algebra A there is a largest compactly quasinilpotent\nideal Rcq (A). The map A 7\u2212\u2192 Rcq (A) is a hereditary topological radical.\nIt is possible to give an individual test for an element to belong to Rcq (A). It\nis formally similar to the known characterization of the elements in the Jacobson\nradical.\nTheorem 3.3. An element a \u2208 A belongs to Rcq (A) if and only if \u03c1(aM ) = 0 for\nany precompact set M \u2282 A.\nThe following result shows that Rcq (A) can be considered as inessential when\none calculates the joint spectral radius.\nTheorem 3.4. Let q = qRcq (A) be the quotient map A \u2212\u2192 A/Rcq (A). Then\n\u03c1(M ) = \u03c1(q(M )) for each precompact set M \u2282 A.\n3.2. The hypocompact radical. We denote the set of all compact elements of a\nBanach algebra A by C(A). Note that C(A) is a semigroup ideal of A not closed, in\ngeneral, under addition, even for semisimple Banach algebras. The following result\nfollows easily from the Open Mapping Theorem.\nLemma 3.5. If f : A \u2212\u2192 B is a continuous surjective homomorphism of Banach\nalgebras then f (C(A)) \u2282 C(B).\nLemma 3.6. Let J be an ideal of A. If C(J) 6= 0 then J \u2229 C(A) 6= 0.\nProof.

Let A be a Banach algebra. Then\n\u2022 If a \u2208 C(A) then the ideal J (a) generated by a is bicompact.\n\u2022 If J is a bicompact ideal of A then the operator La Rb is compact for every\na, b \u2208 span(JA).\nProof. Both statements follow easily from (3.1).\n\n\u0003\n\nA Banach algebra A is called hypocompact if every non-zero quotient A/J has\na non-zero compact element. An ideal is hypocompact if it is hypocompact as a\nBanach algebra.\nClearly each bicompact algebra is hypocompact. We will see that all hypocompact algebras can be obtained by subsequent extensions of bicompact ones. Let us\nprove first that the class of all hypocompact algebras is stable under extensions.\nLemma 3.8. Let J be an ideal of A. If J and A/J are hypocompact then A is\nhypocompact.\nProof. Let I be an ideal of A. If J \u2282 I then A/I can be identified with (A/J)/(I/J),\nthe quotient of a hypocompact algebra. By definition, the latter contains non-zero\ncompact elements, so does A/I.\nSuppose now that I does not contain J. Setting K = J \u2229 I we have that\nC(J/K) 6= 0.\nBy Lemma 3.6,\nJ/K \u2229 C(A/K) 6= 0.\nLet 0 6= qK (a) \u2208 J/K \u2229 C(A/K). Then\na\u2208\n/I\nand\nqI (a) \u2208 C(A/I)\nby Lemma 3.5. Thus A/I contains non-zero compact elements.\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 3.9. Let J be an ideal of a Banach algebra A. Then the following\nconditions are equivalent.\n(i) J is hypocompact.\n(ii) For each continuous surjective homomorphism f : A \u2212\u2192 B, either f (J) = 0\nor f (J) \u2229 C(B) 6= 0.\n(iii) There is a transfinite increasing chain of ideals (J\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2264\u03b3 in A such that\nJ1 = 0, J\u03b3 = J, and all J\u03b1+1 /J\u03b1 are bicompact.\n\n\fCALCULATION OF JOINT SPECTRAL RADII\n\n9\n\nProof. (i)=\u21d2(ii) Let I = ker f and K = I \u2229 J. If J \u2282 I then\nf (J) = 0.\nOtherwise there is a non-zero a \u2208 J/K \u2229C(A/K) by Lemma 3.6. Let g : A/K \u2212\u2192 B\nbe defined by\ng (qK (b)) = f (b)\nfor every b \u2208 A. Then g is a continuous surjective homomorphism. Take b \u2208 J such\nthat\na = qK (b) .\nThen f (b) = g (a) is a non-zero compact element of B.\n(ii)=\u21d2(iii) Let us consider all transfinite increasing chains (J\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2264\u03b2 such that\nJ\u03b1 \u2282 J, J\u03b1+1 /J\u03b1 is bicompact and J\u03b1 6= J\u03b1+1 for any \u03b1 < \u03b2. Clearly these chains\nform a set because A is a set. Order the set of chains by\n(J\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2264\u03b21 \u227a (I\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2264\u03b22 if \u03b21 \u2264 \u03b22 and J\u03b1 = I\u03b1 for \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b21 .\nIt follows from the Zorn Lemma that there is a maximal element (J\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2264\u03b3 in this\nset. If J\u03b3 6= J then there is a bicompact ideal I of J/J\u03b3 . Put\nJ\u03b3+1 = {x \u2208 J : qJ\u03b3 (x) \u2208 I}.\nThen one can add J\u03b3+1 to the chain, in contradiction with its maximality.\n(iii)=\u21d2(i) Let I be an ideal of J. Let \u03b1 be the first ordinal for which J\u03b1 is not\ncontained in I. Then\nqI (J\u03b1 ) \u2282 C(J/I).\nIt follows that\nC(J/I) 6= 0.\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.10. An ideal of a hypocompact Banach algebra is hypocompact.\nProof. Let A be hypocompact and J an ideal of A. Let f : A \u2212\u2192 B be a continuous\nsurjective homomorphism, I = ker f and K = I \u2229 J. Assuming f (J) 6= 0, we get\nthat\nC(J/I) 6= 0,\nwhence there is a \u2208 J such that\n0 6= qK (a) \u2208 C(A/K).\nIt follows from Lemma 3.5 that\n0 6= qI (a) \u2208 C(A/I),\nso f (a) is a non-zero compact element of B in f (J).\n\n\u0003\n\nIt follows easily from the definition that a quotient of a hypocompact algebra\nby an ideal is hypocompact. So Lemma 3.8 can be stated in the classical form of\nThree Subspaces Theorem:\nLet A be a Banach algebra. The following are equivalent.\n\u2022 A is hypocompact.\n\u2022 J and A/J are hypocompact for every ideal J of A.\n\u2022 J and A/J are hypocompact for some ideal J of A.\nAs a consequence, we have the following.\nCorollary 3.11. In any Banach algebra there is the largest hypocompact ideal.\n\n\f10\n\nVICTOR S. SHULMAN AND YURI V. TUROVSKII\n\nProof. Let J be the closed linear span of the union of all hypocompact ideals of a\nBanach algebra A. We have to prove that the ideal J is hypocompact.\nBy Proposition 3.9, it suffices to prove that if f : A \u2212\u2192 B is a continuous\nsurjective homomorphism with f (J) 6= 0 then\nf (J) \u2229 C(B) 6= 0.\nBut if f (J) \u2229 C(B) = 0 then\nf (I) = 0\nfor each hypocompact ideal I of A. Hence\nf (J) = 0.\n\u0003\nThe largest hypocompact ideal of a Banach algebra A will be denoted by Rhc (A).\nLemma 3.12. If J is an ideal of A then Rhc (J) = J \u2229 Rhc (A).\nProof. By Corollary 3.10, the ideal J \u2229Rhc (A) of J is hypocompact so it is contained\nin Rhc (J). We have to prove the converse inclusion.\nLet I = span(A1 Rhc (J)A1 ) be the ideal of A generated by Rhc (J). Then\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\nI 3 = span A1 Rhc (J)A1 A1 Rhc (J) A1 A1 Rhc (J)A1\n\u2282 span (JRhc (J)J) \u2282 Rhc (J).\n\nHence I 3 is a hypocompact ideal. But I/I 3 is bicompact because La Rb = 0 for\nevery a, b \u2208 I/I 3 . By Lemma 3.8, I is hypocompact. Then\nI \u2282 Rhc (A)\nand\nRhc (J) \u2282 Rhc (A).\n\u0003\nLemma 3.13. The algebra A/Rhc (A) has no hypocompact ideals and compact elements.\nProof. \bIf J is a hypocompact ideal of A/Rhc (A) then, by Lemma 3.8, its preimage\nJ1 = x \u2208 A : qRhc (A) (x) \u2208 J is a hypocompact ideal of A strictly containing\nRhc (A), a contradiction.\nBy Lemma 3.6, if A/Rhc (A) has compact elements then it has bicompact ideals.\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.14. The map A 7\u2212\u2192 Rhc (A) is a hereditary topological radical.\nProof. (R1) Since A/Rhc (A) has no hypocompact ideals, we have that\nRhc (A/Rhc (A)) = 0.\n(R2) Let f : A \u2192 B be a continuous surjective homomorphism. Denote qRhc (B)\nby q, for brevity. Clearly q\u25e6f is a continuous surjective homomorphism of A to\nB/Rhc (B). Since Rhc (A) is hypocompact, q\u25e6f (Rhc (A)) is either zero or contains\na compact element of B. But the latter is impossible by Lemma 3.13.

Let P1 and P2 be hereditary topological radicals. For\nany Banach algebra A, put\nP0 (A) = P1 (A) \u2229 P2 (A).\nTheorem 3.15. The map A 7\u2212\u2192 P0 (A) is a hereditary topological radical.\nProof. Set D = A/P0 (A). There is a natural surjective homomorphism q1 : D \u2192\nA/P1 (A) defined by\nq1 (a/P0 (A)) = a/P1 (A).\nSince P1 (A/P1 (A)) = 0, we have that\nq1 (P1 (D)) = 0\nand\nP1 (D) \u2282 ker(q1 ).\nTherefore, if an element a/P0 (A) of D belongs to the kernel of the homomorphism\nq1 , then a \u2208 P1 (A). We get that\nP1 (D) \u2282 {a/P0 (A) : a \u2208 P1 (A)}.\nSimilarly,\nP2 (D) \u2282 {a/P0 (A) : a \u2208 P2 (A)}.\nHence\nP0 (D) \u2282 {a/P0 (A) : a \u2208 P1 (A) \u2229 P2 (A)} = P0 (A)/P0 (A).\nIn other words,\nP0 (D) = 0.\nWe proved that P0 satisfies condition (R1).\nIf f : A \u2212\u2192 B is a continuous surjective homomorphism then\nf (P0 (A)) \u2282 f (P1 (A)) \u2282 P1 (B)\nand, similarly,\nf (P0 (A)) \u2282 P2 (B).\nHence\nf (P0 (A)) \u2282 P0 (B),\ntherefore P0 satisfies (R2).\nFor an ideal J \u2282 A, one has\nP0 (J) = P1 (J) \u2229 P2 (J) = (P1 (A) \u2229 J) \u2229 (P2 (A) \u2229 J) = P0 (A) \u2229 J.\nWe proved (R3).\nThe radical P0 constructed in the previous theorem is denoted by P1 \u2227 P2 .\nwill consider the radical Rad \u2227Rhc .\nLet us introduce a standard order in the class of all topological radicals by\nrule\nP1 \u2264 P2\nif P1 (A) \u2282 P2 (A) for every Banach algebra A.

Rad \u2227Rhc \u2264 Rcq .\nProof. Let us first show that each bicompact Jacobson radical algebra A is compactly quasinilpotent. Indeed, if M is a precompact family in A then\nr(M ) = 0\nbecause A consists of quasinilpotent elements. For N = LM RM , we see from\nLemma 2.1 that\nr(N ) = 0.\nSince N is a precompact family of compact operators,\n\u03c1(N ) = 0\nby the Berger-Wang formula. Again, we obtain from Lemma 2.1 that\n\u03c1(M ) = 0.\nLet now A be an arbitrary Banach algebra and J = Rad(A) \u2229 Rhc (A). Since J\nis a hypocompact ideal then, by Proposition 3.9, there is a transfinite increasing\nchain (J\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2264\u03b3 of ideals such that\nJ\u03b3 = J\nand all J\u03b3+1 /J\u03b3 are bicompact. Since all bicompact Jacobson radical ideals are\ncompactly quasinilpotent, all J\u03b3+1 /J\u03b3 are Rcq -radical.

We will prove for any precompact set M of elements in a\nBanach algebra A that\n\u03c1(M ) = max{\u03c1\u03c7 (M ), r(M )},\n\n(4.1)\nwhere as above we set\n\n\u03c1\u03c7 (M ) = \u03c1\u03c7 (LM RM )1/2 .\nNote that it suffices to prove this result under the assumption that A is generated\nby M as a Banach algebra. Indeed, \u03c1(M ) and r(M ) do not change if calculated in\nthe closed subalgebra B = A(M ) generated by M . The value \u03c1\u03c7 (M ) in this case\ncannot increase because the multiplication operators act on a smaller space. But\nthe nontrivial inequality in (4.1) is only \u2264.\nSo we may assume in what follows that A = A(M ).

Moreover, to obtain such a sequence\nTn it suffices to take any leading sequence Sn in S(N ) and choose a convergent\nsubsequence from Sn /kSn k (it always exists).\nLemma 4.2. Let A be a Banach algebra, M \u2282 A be precompact and N = LM RM .\nSuppose that A = A (M ), \u03c1\u03c7 (N ) < \u03c1(N ) = 1 and S(N ) is unbounded. Then the\nclosure S+ (N ) contains a non-zero compact operator T such that\n(i) LT h RT g is compact for every elements h, g of A.\n(ii) If also r(N ) < 1 then T (A) \u2282 Rad(A).\nProof. All elements in S+ (N ) are of the form\nP = \u03bbLa Rb ,\nwhere a, b \u2208 S(M ) and \u03bb \u22650. For brevity, we will denote P \u25e6 for any P by\nP \u25e6 = \u03bbLb Ra .\nNote that P \u25e6 may be not uniquely determined by P , but the equality\nLP h RP g = P Lh Rg P \u25e6\nholds independently of the choice of P \u25e6 , for every h, g \u2208 M .\nLet (Sn ) be a leading sequence in S(N ). For every Sn \u2208 N m(n) , the operator Sn\u25e6\ncan also be chosen in N m(n) , so we may assume that\nkSn k \u2265 kSn\u25e6 k\n\n(4.2)\n\nfor all n. By Lemma 4.1, we may choose a sequence of operators\nTn = Skn /kSkn k\nthat tends to a compact operator T . Note that all operators\nTn\u25e6 = Sk\u25e6n /kSkn k\nare contractive by (4.2). Now for any h, g \u2208 A, we have\nLT h RT g = lim LTn h RTn g = lim Tn Lh Rg Tn\u25e6 = lim T Lh Rg Tn\u25e6 .\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nHence the operator LT h RT g is a limit of compact operators, so it is compact.

So does the closure S+ (M )(T x)S+ (M ).\nSince\nT x \u2208 S+ (N )S(M ) = LS+ (M) RS+ (M) S(M ) \u2282 S+ (M )S(M )S+ (M )\n\u2282 S+ (M ),\nthe set S+ (M )(T x)S+ (M ) is a semigroup. By Lemma 2.3, its closed linear span J\nalso consists of compact quasinilpotent elements. Since J coincides with the ideal\nA(T x)A of A, we have that\nA(T x)A \u2282 Rad(A),\nwhence, by the quasi-regular characterization of the Jacobson radical,\nA(T x) \u2282 Rad(A)\nand also\nT x \u2208 Rad(A).\nSince A = span S(M ), we obtain that\nT (A) \u2282 Rad(A).\n\u0003\nLet us call any closed bicompact ideal that consists of quasinilpotent operators\na qb-ideal. The above lemma implies the following result.\nCorollary 4.3. If max {\u03c1\u03c7 (M ) , r (M )} < \u03c1(M ) = 1 and the semigroup S(LM RM )\nis unbounded then A(M ) has a non-zero qb-ideal.\nProof. Indeed, every ideal J generated by T x \u2208 A(M ) is a qb-ideal.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 4.4. If A(M ) has no non-zero qb-ideals then the equality (4.1) holds.\nProof. Suppose that (4.1) fails. We may assume that\n\u03c1(M ) = 1.\nLet N = LM RM . Then we have that\n\u03c1(N ) = 1\nby Lemma 2.1.\nIf the semigroup S(N ) is bounded, then\nmax {\u03c1\u03c7 (N ), r (N )} = 1\nholds by [8, Proposition 9.6]. If \u03c1\u03c7 (N ) = 1 then \u03c1\u03c7 (M ) = 1. Otherwise r(N ) = 1\nand r(M ) = 1 by Lemma 2.1. In both of the cases (4.1) holds, a contradiction.\nSo S(N ) is unbounded. Then A (M ) has a non-zero qb-ideal by Corollary 4.3.\nThis contradicts to our assumptions.\n\u0003\n\n\fCALCULATION OF JOINT SPECTRAL RADII\n\n15\n\nTheorem 4.5. Let A be a Banach algebra. The equality (4.1) holds for each\nprecompact subset M of A.\nProof. Recall that we may assume that A = A(M ). Let J = Rad(A) \u2229 Rhc (A).\nSince\nJ \u2282 Rcq (A)\nby Theorem 3.16,we obtain that\n\u03c1(M ) = \u03c1(M/J).\nby Theorem 3.4. Furthermore, the algebra A/J has no qb-ideals. Indeed, if I is\nsuch an ideal, and U is its preimage in A, then it is evident that\nU \u2282 Rad(A),\nand that\nU \u2282 Rhc (A)\nby the extension property of radicals. Hence\nU \u2282J\nand, as a consequence,\nI = 0.\nTaking into account that A/J = A (M/J), and applying Lemma 4.4, we have that\n\u03c1(M ) = \u03c1(M/J) = max{\u03c1\u03c7 (M/J), r(M/J)} \u2264 max{\u03c1\u03c7 (M ), r(M )}.\nThe converse inequality is evident.\n\n\u0003\n\n4.2.

By Lemma 2.2,\nkLM RM k\u03c7 \u2264 16kM k\u03c7 kM k.\nn\n\nChanging M by M , taking n-th roots and limits as n \u2192 \u221e, we obtain that\n2\n\n\u03c1\u03c7 (M ) = \u03c1\u03c7 (LM RM ) \u2264 \u03c1\u03c7 (M )\u03c1(M ).\nApplying this in (4.1), we get that\n\u03c1(M ) \u2264 max{\u03c1\u03c7 (M )1/2 \u03c1(M )1/2 , r(M )},\nwhence\n\u03c1(M ) \u2264 max{\u03c1\u03c7 (M )1/2 \u03c1(M )1/2 , r(M )1/2 \u03c1(M )1/2 }.\nIt follows from this that\n\u03c1(M )1/2 \u2264 (max{\u03c1\u03c7 (M ), r(M )})\nand we are done, because the converse is evident.\n\n1/2\n\n,\n\u0003\n\n\f16\n\nVICTOR S.

Let I, K be ideals of A and I \u2282 K. If K/I is bicompact and (4.4)\nholds for J = I then it holds for J = K.\nProof.

If J = J\u03b1 , where (J\u03b1 ) is an increasing net of closed ideals of a\nBanach algebra A, then, for a precompact subset M \u2282 A,\n(4.7)\n\nkM/Jk = lim kM/J\u03b1 k = inf kM/J\u03b1 k\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nand\n(4.8)\n\n\u03c1(M/J) = lim \u03c1(M/J\u03b1 ) = inf \u03c1(M/J\u03b1 ).\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nProof. We have\nkM/Jk \u2264 kM/J\u03b1 k\nfor every \u03b1, whence\n1/n\n\n\u03c1(M/J) = inf kM n /Jk\nn\n\n\u2264 inf inf kM n /J\u03b1 k\n\u03b1\n\n1/n\n\nn\n\n= inf \u03c1(M/J\u03b1 ).\n\u03b1\n\nand also\nkM/Jk \u2264 inf kM/J\u03b1 k \u2264 lim inf kM/J\u03b1 k .\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nOn the other hand, it is easy to see that for any a \u2208 M and \u03b5 > 0 there is\n\u03b1 = \u03b1(a, \u03b5) with\n(4.9)\n\nka/J\u03b1 k \u2264 ka/Jk + \u03b5 \u2264 kM/Jk + \u03b5.\n\nTake a finite subset N of M with dist(b, N ) \u2264 \u03b5 for every b \u2208 M . It is clear that,\nfor every c \u2208 A,\nkc/J\u03b2 k \u2264 kc/J\u03b1 k\nif \u03b1 < \u03b2. So, choosing \u03b3 \u2265 max {\u03b1(a, \u03b5) : a \u2208 N }, we obtain from (4.9) that\ndist(b/J\u03b3 , N/J\u03b3 ) \u2264 dist(b, N ) \u2264 \u03b5\nfor every b \u2208 M , and so\nkM/J\u03b3 k \u2264 kN/J\u03b3 k + \u03b5 \u2264 kM/Jk + 2\u03b5.\nTherefore\n(4.10)\n\ninf kM/J\u03b1 k \u2264 lim sup kM/J\u03b1 k \u2264 kM/Jk ,\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nwhence (4.7) holds.

Indeed, there is a transfinite chain {J\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2264\u03b2 of closed ideals such that J0 = 0,\nJ\u03b2 = J, and all J\u03b1+1 /J\u03b1 are bicompact. Suppose that \u03b3 is the least \u03b1, for which\n(4.4) fails. It cannot be a limit ordinal because of Lemma 4.10 and cannot have a\npredecessor because of Lemma 4.9.

Since the operator GBWF is now proved in full generality we may remove the restriction of weak\ncompactness in the applications to the continuity of joint spectral radius which\nwere obtained in [10, Corollary 4.6].\nRecall [8, Proposition 3.1] that the joint spectral radius is an upper semicontinuous function of a bounded subset M of a Banach algebra. This means that\nlim sup \u03c1(Mn ) \u2264 \u03c1(M )\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nif a sequence Mn of bounded subsets tends to M in the sense that the Hausdorff\ndistance between Mn and M tends to zero.\nIndeed, we have that\n\nMnm \u2192 M m\nas n \u2192 \u221e for every m, whence\n\nkMnm k1/m \u2192 kM m k1/m\nas n \u2192 \u221e. Since \u03c1(Mn ) = \u03c1(Mnm )1/m \u2264 kMnm k1/m , we see that\n\nlim sup \u03c1(Mn ) \u2264 kM m k1/m .\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nTaking m \u2192 \u221e, we get that\n\nlim sup \u03c1(Mn ) \u2264 \u03c1(M ).\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nWe say that a set M of elements in a Banach algebra A is a point of continuity\nfor the joint spectral radius if \u03c1(Mn ) \u2192 \u03c1(M ) for any sequence Mn of bounded sets\ntending to M .\nIt is well known that if the norm of an operator T is more than its essential norm\nthen T is a point of continuity of the (usual) spectral radius. The following result\nestablishes the same for precompact families of operators.\nCorollary 4.12. Let M be a precompact set of operators on a Banach set X . If\n\u03c1\u03c7 (M ) < \u03c1(M ) then M is a point of continuity of the joint spectral radius.\nProof. Let Mn tend to M . Since\nlim sup \u03c1(Mn ) \u2264 \u03c1(M ),\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nwe have only to prove that\nlim inf \u03c1(Mn ) \u2265 \u03c1(M ).\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nSuppose the contrary. Multiplying by a scalar and changing Mn by a subsequence,\nwe may assume that\n\u03c1(Mn ) \u2192 \u03b1 < 1 < \u03c1(M )\nand\n\u03c1\u03c7 (M ) < 1.\nIt follows from the formula (1.5) that\n\u03c1(M ) = r(M ).\nHence\nsup{\u03c1(T ) : T \u2208 M k } > 1\n\n\fCALCULATION OF JOINT SPECTRAL RADII\n\n19\n\nfor some k. This means that there is an operator T \u2208 M k with\n\u03c1(T ) > 1.\nNote that\n\u03c1\u03c7 (T ) \u2264 1.\nIndeed, since \u03c1\u03c7 (M ) < 1 then\n\nkM n k\u03c7 < 1\n\nfor sufficiently large n. Hence\nkT nk\u03c7 \u2264 kM nk k\u03c7 < 1\nand it remains to take the n-th roots.\nSince for operators (one-element families) the numbers \u03c1\u03c7 and \u03c1e coincide, we\nconclude that\n\u03c1e (T ) < \u03c1(T ).\nBy our assumptions, there are Tn \u2208 Mnk such that\nTn \u2192 T.\nSince T is a point of continuity of the usual spectral radius,\n\u03c1(Tn ) \u2192 \u03c1(T ).\nBut this is impossible because\n\u03c1(Tn ) \u2264 \u03c1(Mnk ) = \u03c1(Mn )k \u2192 \u03b1k < 1.\n\u0003\nAcknowledgement. The results of the paper, as well as some other results on\ntopological radicals of Banach algebras, were announced in [9]. At about that time\nthe authors realized that the theory of topological radicals admits a systematic\ntreatment in a much more general setting, not only for Banach algebras, but for\nnon-necessarily complete and non-necessarily associative algebras. Also, the class\nof morphisms in such a theory may be different. The development of this approach\ntook a lot of time and in the present moment is far from the end (only one paper\nof the planned series, [11], is published). Thus the proof of the generalized BergerWang formula was unpublished for several years. The aim of the present publication\nis to make the proof available for specialists.\nIt should be noted that the list of generalized Berger-Wang formulae given here\nis not complete. The stronger variants of these formulae, as well as an exposition\nof some topics of topological radicals, will be published elsewhere.\nReferences\n[1] M. A. Berger, Y.
