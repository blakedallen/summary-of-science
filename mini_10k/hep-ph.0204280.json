Eberl, W. Majerotto, and V. C. Spanos\nInstitut f\u00fcr Hochenergiephysik der \u00d6sterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften,\nA\u20131050 Vienna, Austria\n\nAbstract\n\u221a\nFor energies relevant to future linear colliders, s & 500 GeV, the W W fusion\nchannel dominates the Higgs boson production cross section e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bdh0 . We have\ncalculated the one-loop corrections to this process due to fermion and sfermion loops\nin the context of the MSSM. As a special case, the contribution of the fermion loops\nin the SM has also been studied. In general, the correction is negative and sizeable\nof the order of 10%, the bulk of it being due to fermion loops.\n\n\fAs no Higgs boson could be detected so far, the search for the Higgs boson as the\nprimary goal of high energy physics will continue. The four LEP experiments delivered\na lower bound for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs mass, mh & 114 GeV [1]. In e+ e\u2212\ncollisions, for energies & 200 GeV, the production of a single Higgs boson plus missing\nenergy starts to be dominated by W W fusion [2, 3, 4], that is e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e \u03bde W W \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e \u03bde h0 ,\n\nwhereas the Higgsstrahlung process [5] e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Zh0 \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bd h0 becomes less important. h0\ndenotes the SM Higgs boson or the light Higgs boson of the Minimal Supersymmetric\n\nStandard Model (MSSM), while H 0 is the heavy CP -even Higgs boson in the MSSM.\nThe rates for the ZZ fusion are generally one order of magnitude smaller than those of\nthe W W channel.\nAt LHC, in p p collisions, the gluon-gluon fusion mechanism provides the dominant\ncontribution to Higgs production. The next important Higgs production channel is vectorboson fusion V V \u2192 h0 /H 0 . In particular, it provides an additional event signature\ndue to the two energetic forward jets. Recently, it has been argued that the channels\nW W \u2192 h0 /H 0 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 and W W , can serve as suitable search channels at LHC even for a\nHiggs boson mass of mh \u223c 120 GeV [6].\nAt Tevatron, with p p\u0304 collisions at 2 TeV, the W W fusion process plays a less important r\u00f4le. The g g fusion is the dominant process for Higgs production there, but the\n\nHiggsstrahlung q q\u0304 \u2192 W \u2192 W h0 is larger than the W W fusion for mh . 180 GeV [7].\nIt is worth mentioning that W W (and ZZ) fusion is also the most important Higgs\nboson production mechanism in e p collisions. Actually, it was shown [8] that the e poption at LHC would offer the best opportunity to search for a Higgs boson in the mass\nrange mh < 140 GeV.\nIn this paper, we have calculated the leading one-loop corrections to the W W h0 vertex\nin the MSSM by taking into account fermion/sfermion loops. They are supposed to be\nthe dominant corrections due to the Yukawa couplings. We have applied them to the\n\u221a\nHiggs boson production in e+ e\u2212 annihilation in the energy range s = 0.5 \u2212 3 TeV, i. e.\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e \u03bde W W \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e \u03bde h0 . We included the Higgsstrahlung process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Zh0 \u2192\n\n\u03bd\u0304\u03bd h0 and the interference between these two mechanisms. Because the Higgsstrahlung\nprocess is much smaller in this range, we have neglected its radiative corrections. We have\n\nalso discussed the SM case where we have studied the dependence on the Higgs boson\nmass. As to the one-loop corrections to the W W h0 vertex in the SM, we quite generally\nrefer to the review article [9]. For this coupling also QCD corrections were included, the\nO(\u03b1s GF m2t ) in [10] and O(\u03b1s2 GF m2t ) in [11].\n\u221a\nAs for energies s > 500 GeV the dominant channel e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bdh0 is by far the W W\n1\n\n\fe\nW+\n\nW+\n\nh0\n\u0001gWW\n\n+\n\nh0\nW+\ne\n\n\u0017e\n\ne\n\n\u0017e\n\nh0\n\n+\n\nZ\n\nW+\n\nMW\n\ne\n\n\u0017e\n\n\u0017e\n\n\u0017e;\u0016;\u001c\n\nZ\n\ne\n\n\u0001MW\n\ntree\n\nh0\n\ne\n\n\u0017e;\u0016;\u001c\n\nMZ\n\ntree\n\n2\nFigure 1: The Feynman graphs for the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bdh0 . Note that for |Mtree\nZ | one\nhas to sum over all three neutrino flavors.\n\nfusion, in the context of our calculation only corrections to the W W h0 vertex must be\nevaluated, see Fig. 1. At the one-loop level the Lagrangian for the W W h0 coupling can\nbe written as\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0011\n\u0010 0\n\u03bc\u03bd\nh\n\u03bc\u03bd\nh0\ng\n+\n\u2206g\nh0 W\u03bc+ W\u03bd\u2212 ,\nL = gW\nW\nWW\n\n(1)\n\n0\n\nh\nwhere the tree-level coupling in the MSSM can be read as gW\nW = g mW sin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1). The\n0\none-loop part of the W W h coupling in Eq. (1) can be expressed in terms of all possible\n\nform factors1 as\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03bc\u03bd\nh0\n\u2206gW\n= F 00 g \u03bc\u03bd + F 11 k1\u03bc k1\u03bd + F 22 k2\u03bc k2\u03bd + F 12 k1\u03bc k2\u03bd + F 21 k2\u03bc k1\u03bd + i F \u01eb \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03b4 k1\u03c1 k2\u03b4 , (2)\nW\nwhere k1,2 denote the four-momenta of the off-shell W -bosons. At tree-level only the\nstructure with g\u03bc\u03bd is present, and therefore all form factors but F 00 have to be ultra\nviolet (UV) finite without being renormalized. By adding appropriate counter terms also\nthe form factor F 00 is rendered UV finite. For the renormalization procedure the on-shell\nscheme has been adopted.\nActually, for the calculation of the one-loop corrected W W h0 vertex we compute the\nvertex and the wave-function corrections stemming from the graphs of Fig. 2, as well as\nthe coupling correction,\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010 0\n\u0010 0 \u0011\n\u03bc\u03bd\nh (w)\nh0 (c)\nh (v) \u03bc\u03bd\nh0\n\u2206gW W\n+ \u03b4gW W + \u03b4gW W g \u03bc\u03bd .\n= \u03b4gW W\n\n(3)\n\nComparing Eq.

We have also defined k1 = p3 \u2212 p1 , k2 = p2 \u2212 p4 ,\nq1 = p1 + p2 and q2 = p3 + p4 .\nFor the calculation of the cross section at tree-level, it is possible to perform some of\nthe phase space integrations analytically and the rest of them numerically [3, 4]. However\nincluding the one-loop correction terms of Eq. (7) and (8), it is impossible to perform\nany of these integrations analytically. Therefore, we have performed the integrations\nnumerically, using efficient numerical integration subroutines found in the NAG library.\nWe have also checked that for the tree-level case our completely numerical calculation\nagrees with high accuracy with the semi-analytical results of Ref. [4].\nBefore embarking on discussing our numerical findings, we will make some comments\nconcerning some details of our calculation. For the calculation of the supersymmetric\n(SUSY) Higgs boson masses and the Higgs mixing angle \u03b1, a computer programme based\non Ref. [14] has been used. The tree-level W W h0 coupling for values of tan \u03b2 > 5 as\npreferred by the LEP Higgs boson searches, mimics the SM one. For the calculation of\n2\n\nAs it has already been mentioned the corresponding corrections\n\u221a to the Higgsstrahlung process can\nbe safely ignored due to absolute dominance of the W W fusion for s > 500 GeV.\n\n4\n\n\f600\n\n200\n\n500\n\n100\n\n300\n\n\u001b\n\n200\n\n50\n200\n\n\u001b0\n\n400\n\n150\n\n[f b]\n\n[f b]\n\n250\n\n100\n400\n\nps600\n[GeV]\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n2\nps1.5\n[TeV]\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n\u221a\nFigure 3: The various cross sections as functions of s (left). The dotted-dashed line\nrepresents the tree-level cross section \u03c30W W , the dotted line \u03c30W W + \u03c30h\u2212str . The dashed\nline includes also the interference term \u03c30interf. and represents the total tree-level cross\nsection. The solid line includes the one-loop correction. The SUSY parameters are:\ntan \u03b2 = 10, \u03bc = \u2212100 GeV, A = \u2212500 GeV, mQ\u0303 = 300 GeV, MA = 500 GeV, and\nM2 = 400 GeV. For the same set of parameters\nalso the tree-level cross section \u03c30 and\n\u221a\nthe one-loop corrected \u03c3 are plotted for s up to 3 TeV (right).\nthe fermion/sfermion one-loop corrections to the W W h0 vertex, the contribution of the\nthird family of fermions/sfermions has been taken into account. This contribution turns\nout to be the dominant one, in comparison with the first two families corrections, due\nto the large values of the Yukawa couplings ht and hb . The effect of the running of the\ncoupling constants g and g \u2032 has been taken into account.\nWe now turn to the discussion of our numerical results. In Fig. 3 (left) we can see\n\u221a\nthe various cross sections as a function of s for values up to 1 TeV. The dotted-dashed\nline represents the contribution from the W W channel at tree-level alone, whereas the\ndotted line includes the Higgsstrahlung contribution as well. The dashed line comprises\nin addition the interference between the W W channel and Higgsstrahlung. One can\nperceive that the size of this interference term is extremely small, and for this reason\nthe difference between the dotted and dashed lines is rather minute. It is also clear that\n\u221a\nfor s & 500 GeV the W W fusion contribution dominates the total cross section for\n\u221a\nthe Higgs production e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bdh0 . Actually, for s & 800 GeV the total tree-level\ncross section is due to W W fusion. In the solid line we have taken into account the\none-loop correction from the fermion/sfermion loops. The correction is always negative\nwith a significant size of the order of 10%. This can also be seen from Fig. 3 (right),\nwhere we have plotted the tree-level cross section \u03c30 (dashed line) and the one-loop\n\n5\n\n\f\u0001\u001b=\u001b0 [%]\n\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n0.5\n\n1\n\n2\nps1.5\n[TeV]\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n\u221a\nFigure 4: The relative correction \u2206\u03c3/\u03c30 as a function of s (\u2206\u03c3 = \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c30 ), where \u03c30\nis the tree-level and \u03c3 the one-loop corrected cross section. The solid and dashed lines\ncorrespond to two different choices of the SUSY parameters, as described in the text.\ncorrected cross section \u03c3 (solid line) for energies up to 3 TeV. For simplicity, for all\n9 11\nplots we have used At = Ab = A\u03c4 = A, {m\u0168 , mD\u0303 , mL\u0303 , m\u1ebc } = { 10\n, 10 , 1, 1} mQ\u0303 and\n\nM1 = 53 M2 tan2 \u03b8W . The choice of a common trilinear coupling and the correlation\nbetween the soft sfermion masses are inspired by unification. For the plots in Fig. 3 we\n\nhave taken: tan \u03b2 = 10, \u03bc = \u2212100 GeV, A = \u2212500 GeV, mQ\u0303 = 300 GeV, MA = 500 GeV,\nand M2 = 400 GeV. Choosing different sets of parameters, the basic characteristics of\nthese plots remain indifferent. In fact, the soft gaugino masses M1,2 affect only the Higgs\nsector through radiative corrections.\n\u221a\nIn Fig. 4 the relative correction \u2206\u03c3/\u03c30 is presented as a function of s for two different\nsets of parameters. The solid line corresponds to the set tan \u03b2 = 10, \u03bc = \u2212100 GeV,\nA = \u2212500 GeV, mQ\u0303 = 300 GeV, MA = 500 GeV, and M2 = 400 GeV, whereas for the\n\ndashed line we have taken tan \u03b2 = 40, \u03bc = \u2212300 GeV and A = \u2212100 GeV, keeping the\nrest of them unchanged. This figure shows that the size of the one-loop correction to the\n\u221a\nHiggs production cross section is practically constant for s > 500 GeV and weighs about\n\u221215%, almost independently of the choice of the SUSY parameters. The reason for this\nweak dependence is that the one-loop corrections are dominated by the fermion loops, and\ntherefore the total correction is not very sensitive to the choice of the SUSY parameters.\n\u221a\nIn this region, s > 500 GeV, one can compare this constant correction with the effective\napproximation of Ref. [10], where one only corrects the W W h0 coupling. Although the\nsign of this approximation is correct, it does not fully account for the whole effect.\nIn Fig. 5 we have plotted the cross section as a function of mh for the SM case,\n\u221a\nfor s = 0.8 TeV (red lines) and 1 TeV (black lines).

The dashed lines correspond to the tree-level cross section, whereas the solid lines\nto the one-loop corrected one.\nthe tree-level cross section for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bdh0 , whereas the solid lines contains the oneloop correction stemming from the fermion loops. In addition, the couplings have been\nadjusted to the SM corresponding couplings. The plot exhibits the expected dependence\nof the cross section on mh . What must be noticed is that especially for small Higgs boson\nmasses . 200 GeV, the size of the fermion loops correction becomes important for the\ncorrect determination of the Higgs boson mass.\nFinally, Fig. 6 exhibits the percentage of the sfermion loops to the total one-loop\ncorrection as a function of tan \u03b2 (left) and \u03bc (right), for two different values of \u03bc and\ntan \u03b2, respectively, as shown in the figure. In the left (right) figure we have chosen\nA = \u2212100 GeV (A = \u2212400 GeV). The rest of SUSY parameters are: mQ\u0303 = 300 GeV,\n\u221a\nMA = 500 GeV, and M2 = 400 GeV. Here s has been fixed to 1 TeV. The grey area in\nthe right figure is excluded due to the chargino mass bound. We see that the maximum\nvalue of order 10% can be achieved for large values of \u03bc and tan \u03b2. There, due to the\nsignificant mixing in the stop and sbottom sector, the contribution of stops and sbottoms\nin the loops is enhanced. For these values of SUSY parameters the sfermion masses\napproach their experimental lower bounds. But even there the dominant correction, at\nleast 90% of the total correction, is due to the fermion loops.\nIn conclusion, we have calculated the fermion/sfermion loops corrections to the single\nHiggs boson production e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bdh0 in the context of the MSSM and SM. They are\nsupposed to be the dominant radiative corrections. For energies relevant to the future\n\u221a\nlinear colliders, s & 500 GeV, the W W fusion channel dominates the cross section. In\ngeneral, the correction due to fermion/sfermion loops is negative and yields a correction\n\n7\n\n\f10\n\n10\n\u0016=\n\n9\n\n300 GeV\n\n8\n7\n6\n\n\u0016=\n\n5\n\n\u0001\u001bf~=\u0001\u001b [%]\n\n\u0001\u001bf~=\u0001 \u001b [%]\n\n11\n\n200 GeV\n\n8\n\ntan = 15\n\n6\n4\n\ntan = 7\n\n2\n\n10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45\n\n-1000 -600 -200\n\n200\n\n\u0016 [GeV]\n\ntan\n\n600\n\n1000\n\nFigure 6: The percentage of the sfermions to the total one-loop correction as a function of\ntan \u03b2 (left) and \u03bc (right).\nThe rest of the SUSY parameters have been fixed as described\n\u221a\nin the text. Here s = 1 TeV. The grey area in the right figure is excluded due to the\nchargino mass bound.\nto the cross section of the order of \u221210%. The bulk of this correction stems from the\n\nfermion loops, and usually turns to be more than 90% of the total correction. For the\ncase of maximal mixing in the sfermion mass matrices, the contribution of the sfermion\n\nloops is enhanced, but nevertheless weighs less than 10% of the total one-loop correction.\n\u221a\nAs the correction is dominated by fermion loops and is rather independent of s for\n\u221a\ns > 500 GeV, we think that it can be approximated by a factor correction to the\ntree-level cross section. Such an approximation would be most useful for including initial\nstate radiation (ISR) and beamstrahlung in an efficient way.\n\nAcknowledgements\nV. C.
