They present a randomly selected magnitude-limited sample, so it is important\nto use a reliable and automated classification scheme which identifies normal single stars\nand discovers different types of peculiar stars. To this end we present a morphological\nclassification of \u223c 350, 000 RAVE survey stellar spectra using locally linear embedding,\na dimensionality reduction method which enables representing the complex spectral\nmorphology in a low dimensional projected space while still preserving the properties\nof the local neighborhoods of spectra. We find that the majority of all spectra in the\ndatabase (\u223c 90 \u2212 95 %) belong to normal single stars, but there is also a significant\npopulation of several types of peculiars. Among them the most populated groups are\nthose of various types of spectroscopic binary and chromospherically active stars. Both\nof them include several thousands of spectra. Particularly the latter group offers significant further investigation opportunities since activity of stars is a known proxy of\nstellar ages. Applying the same classification procedure to the sample of normal single\nstars alone shows that the shape of the projected manifold in two dimensional space\ncorrelates with stellar temperature, surface gravity and metallicity.\nSubject headings: stars: peculiar - methods: numerical - techniques: spectroscopic\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the era of automated astronomical surveys the amount of data they produce is overwhelming. This holds especially true for large spectroscopic surveys like the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey\n(Colless et al. 2001), the 6dF Galaxy Survey (Jones et al. 2004), the Radial Velocity Experiment\n(RAVE, Steinmetz et al. 2006), the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, Abazajian et al. 2009), the\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nGaia-ESO Survey, the Hermes-Galah project, and the highly anticipated Gaia mission. A common approach in getting an overview of the observed sample of spectra and learn more about\nits morphological diversity is to classify spectra according to some criterion (a classical example\nis the MKK classification scheme for single stars). When dealing with a large spectral sample,\nan automated approach becomes a necessity. Several different dimensionality reduction numerical\nmethods became popular for such tasks. One of the first uses of artificial neural networks for\nstellar spectra classification was performed by Gulati et al. (1994) and von Hippel et al. (1994),\nfollowed by many other authors. Another frequently used technique applied to the same problem\nis principal component analysis (PCA). It was used by Connolly et al. (1995) for galaxy spectra\nclassification and later by other authors for the classification of stellar spectra (e.g. Ibata & Irwin\n1997; Bailer-Jones et al. 1998; McGurk et al. 2010). Lately, another method related to PCA named\nlocally linear embedding (LLE, Roweis & Saul 2000) was used by VanderPlas & Connolly (2009)\nfor classification of SDSS galaxy spectra and by Daniel et al. (2011) for classification of SDSS stellar\nspectra. The latter method seems particularly suitable for classification purposes since it is able\nto grasp the complex spectral morphologies and project the spectra onto a low dimensional space\nwhere the correlations between the spectra can be studied more easily.\nRAVE is an ongoing radial velocity survey aiming at measuring radial velocities of up to 106\nstars in the southern sky. Based on observations with the UK Schmidt Telescope, the experiment\nemploys the 6dF multi-fiber instrument which is capable of recording up to 150 stellar spectra\nsimultaneously. The wavelength range of the observed spectra ranges from \u223c 8420 \u00c5 to \u223c 8780 \u00c5\nwith a typical resolving power of R \u223c 7500 (similar wavelength but with somewhat larger resolving\npower was selected for the instrument aboard the Gaia mission). The selection of the observed\nstars is magnitude limited (9 < I < 12). The reduction and analysis pipeline is designed to provide\nradial velocities as well as atmospheric parameters of stars. The latter are calculated by finding\nthe best matching fit to the observed spectrum from a library of synthetic spectra by Munari et al.\n(2005). During the reduction process all spectra are shifted to the zero radial velocity system. The\ndata are made publicly available through incremental data releases. The latest one was published\nby Siebert et al. (2011). Till this date, a couple of papers already discussed some types of peculiar\nspectra found in the RAVE survey. Munari et al. (2009) focused on luminous blue variables in the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud and Matijevi\u010d et al. (2010) analyzed spectra of double-lined spectroscopic\nbinary candidates.\nCurrently, the RAVE pipeline is lacking a classification processing stage. While it is known\nthat the majority of spectra observed by RAVE belong to non-peculiar single stars, a quick browse\nthough the spectra of already observed stars reveals that there is a significant number of both\npeculiar and problematic spectra present in the database. Since the stellar parameters pipeline\npresumes that all spectra can be properly fit by a single star synthetic spectrum, neglecting the\noutliers can lead to wrong results in both radial velocities and atmospheric parameters. Searching\nfor peculiar spectra based on the goodness of fit between the observed and the synthetic spectrum\nis very unreliable and previous classification attempt (Matijevi\u010d et al. 2010) is only efficient at\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nidentifying double-lined spectroscopic binary spectra but it fails to give a reliable classification of\nthe whole sample. To correct for these deficiencies, this study presents a consistent morphological\nclassification of the RAVE spectra with three main goals: to (1) provide a clean sample without\nany peculiar or problematic spectra so further studies based on the results of the RAVE survey\ncan be more reliable, (2) identify any interesting peculiar spectra, and (3) highlight all problematic\nspectra that were corrupted either at the observation or reduction stage so they can be reprocessed\nif possible, or discarded.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the inner workings of\nthe LLE method. Section 3 explains the procedure we used to classify RAVE spectra and finally\nthe results of the classification are given in Section 4 followed by a summary in Section 5.\n\n2.\n\nLocally Linear Embedding\n\nLLE is a general dimensionality reduction method introduced by Roweis & Saul (2000). The\nkey feature and an advantage over some other similar approaches is that this method preserves\nthe relations between neighboring points in a lower-dimensional projection. Points that are close\ntogether (by some definition of distance) in a high dimensional space, remain close together in\na low-dimensional projected space. This makes it easier to discover different hidden relations\nbetween data points. The method itself is relatively simple and can be outlined in three main\nsteps. A detailed description and derivation can be found in Roweis & Saul (2000), de Ridder &\nDuin (2002), Saul & Roweis (2003) and VanderPlas & Connolly (2009), on which the following is\nbased on.\nWhen applying this method to the spectral data, each dimension in the initial D dimensional\nspace is represented by each wavelength bin at which the spectrum is sampled, so each spectrum\ncan be considered a point in the D dimensional space. In order for spectra to be comparable among\neach other, the sampling points must be equal for all spectra.\nHaving denoted the vector of N input spectra with x = (x1 , ..., xN ), we first need to find\nk nearest neighbors of each of the members of x, were k \u001c N . Note that the distance between\ndata points is metric dependent. Throughout this work we used euclidean distances. For later\nwe will denote the vectors of indexes of the nearest neighbors with\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 j, if j-th spectrum is among the nearest\nki =\nneighbors of the i-th spectrum\n\uf8f3\n0, otherwise\n\nthe\nthe\nuse\n\n(1)\n\nFollowing the first step, the local geometry of each data point is characterized by a linear\ncombination of its neighbors. This step requires that the manifold on which the data points lie is\nsampled well enough that for all points from the data set the linear approximation is sufficiently\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\naccurate. The cost function related to the reconstruction error is written as\nX\nX\n2\nE(w) =\nxi \u2212\nwji xj .\ni\n\n(2)\n\nj\n\nThe index i passes through all spectra in the data set and the index j through all the k nearest\nneighbors of the i-th spectrum. The weights wji describe the contribution of the j-th neighborhood\nspectrum to the reconstruction of the i-th one. To find a set of weights w = (w1 , ..., wN ) that\nwill optimally reconstruct all data points, we need to minimize the cost function E, enforcing the\nrequirement that all weights contributing to the reconstruction of a single spectrum must add up\nto 1,\nX\nwji = 1.\n(3)\nj\n\nThis is done by applying the Lagrangian multiplier \u03bbi to Equation (2),\nE i (w) =\n\nX\n\nwji (xi \u2212 xj )\n\n2\n\n\u2192\n\n(4)\n\nj\n\n\u2192\n\nk X\nk\nX\n\n\uf8eb\ni\nwji wli Cjl\n\u2212 2\u03bbi \uf8ed1 \u2212\n\nj=1 l=1\n\n\uf8f6\nX\n\nwji \uf8f8 ,\n\n(5)\n\nj\n\nwhere E i (w) is the cost function corresponding to the reconstruction of the i-th point, and\ni\n= (xi \u2212 xj )T (xi \u2212 xl )\nCjl\n\n(6)\n\nis the neighborhood correlation matrix. The expression in Equation (4) follows from Equation (2)\nwhen taking into account Equation (3). Optimal weights are found to be equal to\nP i \u22121\nl (Cjl )\ni\nwj = P P\n,\n(7)\ni\n\u22121\nm\nn (Cmn )\nso the inverse of the correlation matrix needs to be calculated. Since this is a computationally\nintensive operation, a faster way of calculating the weights is to solve the linear system\nX\ni i\nCjl\nwl = 1,\n(8)\nj\n\nand to rescale the weights to satisfy Equation (3). If it happens that the correlation matrix is\nalmost singular, a small fraction of the identity matrix can be added to it. VanderPlas & Connolly\n(2009) suggested that a small fraction of the trace of the matrix C can be used so that\nC \u2192 C + rI,\nwhere they used the value of r = 10\u22123 Tr(C).\n\n(9)\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nIn the last step of the method we need to find the d < D dimensional space Y onto which the\ndata points can be optimally mapped using the same set of weights w as calculated before. The\ncost function related to the projection error is given by\nX\nX\n2\n\u1ebc(Y ) =\nyi \u2212\nwji yj ,\n(10)\ni\n\nj\n\nwhere yi is the vector to the i-th point in the Y space. Stacking all weights wji in a single N \u00d7 N\nsparse matrix W so that each row of the matrix corresponds to a single weight vector wi and\nindividual weights wji from wi are positioned according to the elements from the vectors ki , enables\nus to rewrite Equation (10) as\n\u1ebc(Y ) =\n\nn X\nn\nX\n\nMij yiT yj = Tr(YMYT )\n\n(11)\n\nj=1 l=1\n\nwhere M = (I \u2212 W)(I \u2212 W)T . To avoid the trivial solution Y = 0, we can subject this function to\nthe constraint\n(YYT ) = I.\n(12)\nSimilar as before, we can use Lagrangian multipliers and after setting the derivatives to zero we\nfinish up with\n(M \u2212 \u039b)YT = 0,\n(13)\nwhere \u039b denotes the diagonal matrix of all Lagrangian multipliers. Eigenvectors with the smallest\neigenvalues are the ones we are looking for since they minimize the \u1ebc(Y ) and the eigenvector with\nthe zero eigenvalue can be omitted since it only contributes to translation in space (Roweis & Saul\n2000; de Ridder & Duin 2002).\nBecause of the dependence of the projection space Y on the weights w and consequently on\nthe nearest neighbors of each point, the shape of the final projection depends on the input sample.\nThis means that whenever new points are added to the sample, the whole process of projecting\nthem has to be redone. The calculation of the projection can also be problematic if the input\nsample is large. To overcome these drawbacks, VanderPlas & Connolly (2009) proposed a method\nin which we calculate the projection for only a smaller but still representative subset (base) and\nthen add points to an already defined low dimensional space. To do that, we first need to find the k\nnearest neighbors for each new point, but only among members of the base subset. The calculation\nof weights remains the same as described above, but the projection of points to the low dimensional\nspace is computationally much cheaper since all that needs to be calculated are new vectors yi ,\nX\nyi =\nwji yj ,\n(14)\nj\n\nwhere yj are vectors to the k nearest neighbors in the Y space corresponding to the i-th new point.\nSeveral steps of the described method offer a possibility for a significant speed increase if some\napproximative approaches are used, as already noted by VanderPlas & Connolly (2009). In our\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ncalculations we used the FLANN library (Muja & Lowe 2009) for finding the k nearest neighbors.\nThe calculation of weights is an easily parallelizable task and can be spread among multiple processors with a linear speedup. Finally, eigenvectors of sparse matrices can be iteratively calculated\nwith Arnoldi iterations which produce only a few sought-after eigenvectors instead calculating them\nall. In our case we used the routines from the ARPACK library. The code is available upon request\nfrom the authors.\n\n3.\n\nClassification Procedure\n\nFor this analysis we used the RAVE 101111 internal data release database that consists of\n434,807 observations of 373,138 stars. Of all these spectra we analyzed only those with S/N > 20,\nand removed all spectra that are part of the first data release. The reason for the latter exclusion is\nthat these spectra were polluted with second order light and are therefore not directly comparable\nto spectra recorded later when a blocking filter was installed. This selection lowered the number of\nspectra in our sample to 350,962. All spectra were treated individually and no connections between\nrepeated observations of the same objects were taken into account during the analysis.\nDue to the arbitrary radial velocities of the stars, the RAVE spectra are sampled at different\nwavelength bins when they are transfered to the zero-velocity system. To make them comparable,\nwe resampled them to the common wavelength range spanning from 8420 \u00c5 to 8780 \u00c5 with an\nequidistant step of 0.3 \u00c5 using cubic splines. A few spectra did not cover the selected range, so we\npadded them with unity values on either side to cover the entire range. Slight oversampling (1200\nwavelength bins instead of \u223c 1000 bins RAVE spectra are usually sampled at) yields better results\nbut the number of bins is on the other hand small enough not to hog the calculations.\nThe first step towards producing a meaningful low dimensional projection of the whole sample\nis to define a well-sampled base subsample onto which all other spectra can be projected. Wellsampled refers to different spectral morphologies being equally represented in the subsample. The\niterative process through which we generated the wanted base subsample was started with a random\nselection of 5000 spectra from the whole set of 350,962 spectra. This number was chosen to be large\nenough to include different types of spectra but still small enough so the calculation is performed\nquickly. Note that the random selection of spectra clearly violates the well-sampled assumption\nbecause different spectral morphologies are not represented equally, so this base subset was only\nused as a starting point. With the given subsample, we calculated the LLE projection onto a d = 3\ndimensional space, setting k = 20 and r = 10\u22123 Tr(C). The latter two values were chosen by trial\nand error and were shown to give the cleanest separation between the quasi-classes calculated with\nthe cross-correlation method from Matijevi\u010d et al. (2010). Also, an example from Saul & Roweis\n(2003) shows that the number of nearest neighbors is not critical and does not lead to significantly\ndifferent projections as long as it is not too low or too high. Checking different cross-sections of\nthe projection revealed that the projected manifold is mostly embedded in the first two dimensions\n(upper diagram of Figure 3) so in the following iterations we proceeded with projecting only onto\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- First and second iteration of the classification procedure. The size of the symbols on\nboth diagrams is scaled according to the distance to the nearest neighbor of each point for better\nviewing. For the sake of clarity not all points are shown. The inset in the bottom diagram shows\nthe central region of the LLE projection map where it is possible to see the main arc around which\nthe outliers are scattered.

This was done in a separate\niterative procedure. First, the two dimensional projection was overlaid with a randomly positioned\nuniform mesh and then a limited number of points from each mesh bin was advanced into the next\niteration step. Continuing this process and varying the positions of the centers of mesh bins at each\nstep effectively sieves the sample so that the distribution of the points is more and more uniform.\nThis process was stopped when the number of remaining spectra fell just below 5000, yielding a\nbase subsample for the next step of the main iteration. After that we repeated the previous step\nof projecting the remaining spectra from the full set onto the newly generated base. The projected\nmap is completely different after the second iteration (Figure 3). Since the base subsample in the\nsecond iteration included a greater range of different spectra, the shape of the final projection in the\nsecond iteration was controlled by those points. Examining the underlying spectra of these extreme\npoints (marked with 0 +0 in Figure 3) revealed that the majority of the spectra has a strong spike\nin the bluest part of wavelength range (bottom diagram of Figure 2). Further investigation showed\nthat this was clearly an observational or reduction error since it always plagued spectra recorded\nfrom the same few optical fibers. There are some additional morphological groups of spectra among\nthe extreme outliers. One of them consists of spectra compromised by a specific reduction error\nand another of spectra having very deep TiO bands and largely offset radial velocity shifts (middle\ndiagrams of Figure 2). Note that the majority of TiO band spectra in the RAVE sample does not\nbelong in this group. Among the outliers are also some spectra with faulty wavelength calibration\nand a strong ghost signal (top diagram of Figure 2) that is caused by the light reflected from the\ndetector, recollimated by the camera, reflected back by the grating and finally reimaged by the\ncamera onto the detector (Saunders et al. 2004).\nThese spectra clearly drive the way the projection is rendered and overshadow the majority of\nthe other spectra, so we decided to remove them from the sample. This was done by dropping the\nmost extreme outliers after visually confirming that they had systematic problems or are from the\nTiO band group and to continue with the iteration process until the projected sample did not have\nany obvious outlying points anymore. A final projection that was produced as described is shown\nin Figure 3.\nFor classifying the objects in the projected map, Daniel et al. (2011) suggested continuing\nthe iterative process of picking out the outliers and grouping them together based on the different\nmorphologies. Unfortunately, this approach only works for very distinct morphologies (Carbon\nstars in our case, see Sect. 4), but cannot coherently group classes that are connected continuously,\ni.e. are governed by some process that changes continuously. An example would be a double lined\nbinary spectrum, which is easily identifiable if the Doppler separation between the pairs of spectral\nlines is greater than the resolution limit but such a spectrum can be easily mistaken for that of a\nsingle star if the opposite is true. Instead we proceeded with a different strategy. As before, we\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Final LLE projection map. The top three diagrams show the cross-sections of the\nfirst three dimensions of the projected space, while the main diagram shows the higher resolution\ncross-section of the first two dimensions, where different regions can be best seen. Normal stars are\nintentionally represented with smaller symbols for the sake of clarity. Colors correspond to different\nspectral classes based on the first three largest weights. If the first three classification flags were\ndifferent, the color was calculated as an weighted average of R(ed)G(reen)B(lue) values, where the\nweights were the same as returned by the LLE method. Note that this way of coloring is only used\nto show how the classes mix between each other. The bottom inset shows the log density of points\non the main diagram.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nsieved the final d = 2 projection until the overall number of spectra reached \u223c 5000 and covered\nthe first two dimensions as evenly as possible, creating a new base sample. Then we manually\nclassified all spectra in this base sample by selecting different regions of the projection map from\nFigure 3 and assigning classification flags to spectra in each region. The classification was made\neasier by several studies of morphologies of normal and peculiar spectra already carried out for the\nGaia space mission (Munari 1999; Munari & Tomasella 1999; Munari et al. 2001; Munari 2002,\n2003; Pavlenko et al. 2003; Ragaini et al. 2003; Marrese et al. 2004; Tomasella et al. 2010). Since\nGaia shares a common spectral domain with the RAVE survey, the results of the studies can be\ndirectly applied to our sample. Spectra from the base sample were also compared to the existing\nsolutions calculated by the RAVE pipeline for stellar parameters (Siebert et al. 2011) to search for\nany signs of peculiarity. In the end, spectra were divided into 11 distinct classes discussed in the\nnext section.\nThe automatic classification of the remaining spectra was conducted as follows. First, for\neach spectrum being classified, the k = 20 nearest neighbors were found among the base sample\nand weights were calculated in the same way as described in Sect. 2. Then the weights from the\nreconstruction of each spectrum were ordered according to their absolute values, from the largest\nto the smallest. Since the largest weights belong to those spectra in the base sample that are most\nsimilar to the spectrum being classified, it is possible to assign classes to new spectra based on the\nknown classes of spectra from the base sample (Figure 4). Of course, there is no guarantee that\nthe reference base spectra of a given spectrum are from a single class, so multi-class classifications\nare possible. Examining the classification flags for a number of classified spectra revealed that in\nmost cases only the first three largest weights and the corresponding base spectra are important.\nWe decided to leave the final classification choice to the user. If only a single classification flag is\npreferred, there are multiple choices how to generate it. In our experience a good way of producing\na single flag is to sum all weights corresponding to the same flag that are larger than half of the\nlargest weight and to assign a final flag based on which of the summed flags has the highest score,\ni.e. the one with the largest sum of weights. The other option is to present the user with three\nflags corresponding to three largest weights and let the user decide on the final class.\n\n4.\n\nMorphological Classes of Spectra\n\nBased on the LLE projection we classified spectra into 11 distinct classes that can further\nbe grouped into three supergroups. The first group represents the majority of the RAVE spectra\nand includes normal single stars. Normal in this case denotes all spectra for which it is possible\nto find a suitable counterpart in the library of synthetic spectra and for which one can therefore\nalso calculate a reliable set of parameters. We made a distinction between cooler and hotter stars\nwhere the separation between the two is based on the presence of Paschen series hydrogen lines\nwhich are normally found in spectra of stars with Teff & 7000 K. The second group consists of 8\ndifferent peculiar classes. The term peculiar in a broader sense marks all spectra that do not have\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nnormal\n\nnormal\n\nhot\n\nFig. 4.- Low-dimensional schematic representation of assigning classes. The central dot represents\nthe projected spectrum being classified, while the other dots are its nearest neighbors from the twodimensional base subset. Note that the dots are scattered randomly around the central spot in this\nrepresentation but would otherwise be placed differently, depending on the position in the manifold\nshown in Figure 3. The thickness of the connecting line, the darkness and the size of the symbol\ncorresponds to the magnitude of the weight. In this example a classified spectrum has two normal\nstar spectra and a hot star spectrum among its neighbors with the three largest weights, therefore\nit is considered to be on the border between the normal and hot classes (y1 \u2248 \u22120.02 and y2 \u2248 0.01\nin Figure 3).\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\na counterpart in the library of synthetic spectra and for which it is therefore not possible to infer\ntheir atmospheric parameters by simply finding the best matching synthetic spectrum. In this group\nthere are different kinds of spectroscopic binary stars, stars with an observable emission component\nin the Ca II lines that is a signature of chromospheric activity, cooler giant stars with a significant\nTiO molecular band1 , hot and cool giants, cool normal stars (Teff < 3500 K), carbon stars, and\nother types of peculiars. The last group consists of two classes of spectra with systematic errors.\nIn the first class of this group are spectra with various continuum problems (oscillating continuum\ncaused by poor continuum normalization, ghosting etc.). The second class contains spectra that\nwere poorly calibrated in wavelength, but were not recognized as such in the initial iterations.\n\n4.1.\n\nNormal stars\n\nSingle stars of various stellar types are the most common population in the RAVE sample.\nThey contribute as much as \u223c 95 % of the spectra if their classification is based on the averaging\nmethod described above. Their large abundance in comparison to other morphological types can\nalso be confirmed from the density plot shown in Figure 3. As these are the spectra for which the\natmospheric parameters are reliably estimated, we calculated the LLE projection for a sample of\nthese stars alone to see if there are any correlations between the positions on the projection map\nand various parameters. The procedure is similar as before with the exception of the number of\nnearest neighbors that was set to k = 30 since it produced slightly better results than k = 20.\nResults are shown in Figure 5.\nFrom the top diagram it is evident that the leading parameter in the distribution of points in\nthe two dimensional map is the effective temperature of the stars. The position along the arc can be\nused for a quick estimate of this parameter. A small number of points (\u223c 100) scattered below the\nmain arc corresponds to misclassified spectra due to slight systematic problems like an oscillating\ncontinuum or the presence of spikes. Nevertheless, their number is negligible in comparison to\nnumber of the total spectra in this sample.\nThe distribution of points with respect to surface gravity is consistent with RAVE's bimodal\npopulation distribution. Roughly half of the whole sample is composed of dwarf stars and the other\nhalf of giants, a consequence of RAVE's magnitude limit (Siebert et al. 2011). The separation occurs\njust above y1 = 0 where the values of log(g) become consistent with giant stars. The higher values\nof log(g) at the far right end of the arc are probably overestimated since TiO bands in spectra from\nthis region become more pronounced, which complicates parameter estimation.\nThe diagram showing the metallicity of the stars is consistent with two populations as well.\nParticularly in the region that is populated by giants it is evident that the axis perpendicular to\n1\n\nThis group is equivalent to the one reviewed in Sect. 3. Spectra in the excluded group have largely offset radial\nvelocities and therefore look unique when compared to properly shifted TiO band spectra.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- Cross-section of the first two dimensions of LLE projection of the sample of normal single\nstars calculated with the k = 30 nearest neighbors. The color scales in the diagrams represent\ndifferent values of effective temperature (Teff ), surface gravity (log(g)) and metallicity ([M/H]).\nThe sizes of the points are scaled with respect to the density of the stars for clarity.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nthe main arc describes the metallicity. This effect is stronger with giants since their spectra show\nlarger morphological changes with respect to metallicity than dwarfs, but it can also be observed\nin the part of the diagram populated by dwarfs. The diagram also highlights the underestimation\nof the metallicity of hot stars. This is a known problem and is attributed to the lack of strong\nmetallic lines in these stars.\n\n4.2.\n\nBinary stars\n\nDouble-lined spectroscopic binary stars (SB2) represent . 1 % of RAVE population. The true\nnumber of such objects is hard to estimate due to their variable nature (i.e. if an SB2 is observed\nat a half phase, it spectrum looks very similar to a spectrum of a single star) and line-blending.\nHowever, the simulation from Matijevi\u010d et al. (2010) found that the detection rate should be fairly\nhigh (\u223c 80 %) for systems with orbital periods shorter than \u2248 100 days. In the LLE diagram they\nare close to hot metal-poor stars because their spectra share shallow spectral lines with those two\nclasses. Morphologically, three different types are found among the binary sample (Figure 6). Most\ncommon are the normal SB2s which are well represented by the sum of two Doppler shifted normal\nsingle star spectra. Another distinct group are binaries of the RS CVn type where one or both\nof the components show chromospheric activity through emission in the Ca II lines. In the third\ngroup are W UMa type binary stars. Spectra of these short period binaries have only a few notable\nspectral lines that are broadened by corotation of the components with the system's period.\n\n4.3.\n\nChromospherically active stars / cool dwarfs\n\nChromospherically active star are recognized by the emission component in the central part of\nthe Ca II triplet lines (Andretta et al. 2005). In the RAVE sample they are mostly dwarf stars of\nspectral type K but can also be hotter and cooler. The exact number of such stars in the RAVE\nsample is very difficult to assess due to their variability and the fact that in most stars this effect\nis small so only the most central parts of the Ca II lines are slightly elevated. Nevertheless, if they\nare not identified and they are considered to be normal stars, this can lead to compromised values\nof atmospheric parameters. In comparison to other peculiar types they are the most abundant\nones (between 2 \u2212 3 % of all RAVE spectra). Their position on the LLE map is close to that of\nbinaries since their Ca II lines appear to be split. Thus their position overlaps with a branch of\ncool dwarf stars that are rare in the RAVE survey due to the magnitude selection cut. The level of\nchromospheric activity is a proxy for stellar ages (Mamajek & Hillenbrand 2008) so these objects\ncould be used as an independent age estimator. A sequence of several exemplary spectra with a\ngrowing level of chromospheric emission are shown in Figure 7.\nCool dwarfs on the other hand do not show any particularly interesting peculiarity but were\nexcluded from the main normal star set because their temperatures are lower (Teff < 3500 K) and\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n8\n\nCaII\n\nCaII\n\nCaII\n\n7\n\n6\nTiI TiI\n\nFeI\n\nFeI\n\nFeI\n\nFeI\n\nFeI FeI\n\nnormalized flux\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n8400\n\n8450\n\n8500\n\n8550\n\n8600\nwavelength [A]\n\u25e6\n\n8650\n\n8700\n\n8750\n\n8800\n\nFig. 6.- A selection of of three most common types of binary star spectra. The bottom group\nshows five examples of regular SB2 spectra with a growing separation between the components.\nThe sixth spectrum is a triple star where all three components can be observed spectroscopically.\nThe middle group shows six examples of RS CVn type binary stars with active components. The\ntop group depicts spectra of W UMa type binary stars. The marks identifying individual lines are\ncentered at wavelengths measured in the rest system.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nthey are thus out of reach of the synthetic library used for modeling the spectra.\n\n4.4.\n\nTiO band stars\n\nCool giants stars with a deep TiO molecular band in the bluest part of the spectrum are\nrelatively abundant in the RAVE sample (\u223c 1 %). Some of the stars in this class are non-peculiar\ngiants and are excluded (same as cool dwarfs) due to the lack of synthetic spectra in the library\nwith which they could be modeled. According to the SIMBAD database, there are also many\nknown Mira type pulsating variables in this group. A sequence of selected spectra of this type is\nshown in Figure 8. Starting from the bottom, the leading parameter that changes the shape of the\nspectra of the first group is most likely a decreasing effective temperature. The top six spectra in\nthe second group exhibit an emission component in the Ca II lines in addition to the TiO band.\n\n4.5.\n\nPeculiar giants\n\nIn this case we use the label giant for the separated spectra that lie in the bottom left corner of\nthe projection map in Figure 3. Again, they are not all necessarily peculiar in the classical sense but\ntheir morphologies are very rare in the RAVE sample which is why they are projected separately\nfrom the rest of the normal stars. Also, the best matching spectra from the synthetic library as\npredicted by the parameter estimation pipeline might not sufficiently describe these spectra, which\nis particular problematic given their usually high S/N ratio, so their atmospheric parameters are\nlikely unreliable.. Particularly interesting are the hotter examples (top spectra in Figure 9) with\ndeep N I and narrow Paschen hydrogen lines. Overall they present a negligible contribution to the\nwhole sample with \u223c 100 objects total.\n\n4.6.\n\nCarbon stars\n\nCarbon stars are another very distinct but rare morphological group in the RAVE sample.\nDue to the presence of many CN lines the morphology of the spectra of these stars is very different\nfrom other types. Consequently, their position on the LLE map is isolated and they are also the\nonly group that has a strong third component (Figure 3). Altogether, around 100 such stars are\npresent in the database. A sequence of different spectra of already known carbon stars (according\nto SIMBAD database) is shown in Figure 10.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nCaII\n\nTiI TiI\n\nFeI\n\nCaII\n\nCaII\n\nFeI\n\nFeI FeI\n\n6\n\n5\n\nnormalized flux\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n8400\n\n8450\n\n8500\n\n8550\n\n8600\nwavelength [A]\n\u25e6\n\n8650\n\n8700\n\n8750\n\n8800\n\nFig. 7.- A sequence of chromospherically active stars with growing amplitude of Ca II emission\n(from bottom to top).

Due to their diverse morphologies and\nsparseness it is not possible to group and order them coherently. Some of the spectra from this\nclass have a strong emission component in either Ca II or hydrogen lines. The list includes a couple\nof known Wolf-Rayet stars, Be stars, and other types of variables, but there are no more than a\nfew hundred such objects in the classified sample. A selection of higher S/N spectra from this class\nis shown in Figure 11. Due to the limited amount of information available from a single RAVE\nspectrum we were unable to unambiguously identified most of previously unknown peculiars from\nthis group.\n\n4.8.\n\nProblematic spectra\n\nSpectra with various artifacts (oscillating continuum, ghosts, spikes etc.) or wrong wavelength\ncalibration that certainly influence the fitting procedure and hence their atmospheric parameters\nand radial velocities account for less than 1 % of all RAVE spectra. Their position on the LLE map\nis scattered around the classes, where the spectra that have no problems reside.\n\n5.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe results of this study have shown that LLE can be used as an efficient classification tool.\nIt is able to project the complex morphology of the RAVE stellar spectra onto a two dimensional\nspace and to preserve the relations between neighboring points.\nThe classification procedure was made in several steps by first repeatedly projecting the selected\nsample onto a low dimensional space and culling of the most extreme outliers, for which it turned\nout that are mostly spectra with characteristic systematic problems. Culling is a necessary step\nsince the projection heavily depends on the input sample and leaving the outliers in the sample\novershadows the more interesting morphologies of other spectra. When the final classification\nmap was calculated, a base sample of \u223c 5000 of the most representative spectra were selected by\na sieving process that diluted the densely populated area of the two dimensional map, but left\nthe sparsely populated areas untouched. After this, the sub-selection was manually classified by\nassigning classification flags from 11 distinct morphological classes to all spectra in the subsample.\nClassification flags of the rest of the \u223c 345, 000 spectra were set by finding the nearest neighbors\nfrom the base set and relating the classification flags of the neighbors with the highest weights to\nthe final class of each spectrum. Since there is no unique way of how flags get assigned, the final\nchoice of classification is left to the user. There are two possibilities: either use a single averaged\nflag or rely on the first three flags with the highest corresponding weights. Both ways have their\nuses. The first one is somewhat biased toward normal stars (the majority class) and so some slightly\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n12\n\nH OI\n\nH\n\nCaII H\n\nCaII H\n\nH\n\nNI\n\nCaII H\n\nNININI\n\nNI NI NI\n\nH\n\n10\n\nnormalized flux\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n8400\n\n8450\n\n8500\n\n8550\n\n8600\n\u25e6\nwavelength [A]\n\n8650\n\n8700\n\n8750\n\nFig. 11.- A sequence of spectra of other types (mostly unidentified) of peculiar stars.\n\n8800\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\npeculiar spectra, i.e. chromospherically active stars with only a minor Ca II emission component\nmight be flagged as normal. Since the effect of the emission component in this example is small,\nradial velocities and atmospheric parameters can be trusted relatively well. On the other hand,\nin this example there will likely be at least one active star flag among the top three so it can be\nidentified and further investigated by a user interested in such peculiars. Either way, the most\nmorphologically different spectra belonging to peculiar stars or stars with spectra with systematic\nproblems are flagged appropriately, leaving around \u223c 90 \u2212 95 % of spectra in the normal star class.\nThe analysis and projection of an isolated sample of normal single stars (selected according\nto the first criterion) shows that the shape of the manifold in two dimension correlates with all\nthree major parameters: Teff , log(g) and [M/H]. It also separates between two distinct populations in the RAVE sample (giants and dwarfs) relatively well. The amount of obvious outliers\nthat are highlighted by the projection map is small (several 100), confirming the accuracy of the\nclassification.\nAround 5 \u2212 10 % of the spectra turned out to belong to peculiar stars where the label peculiar\ndenotes all spectra that are plausible (i.e. not problematic) but do not conform to the single normal\nstar class. There are three major groups that comprise the majority of all peculiars: double-lined\nspectroscopic binaries, chromospherically active stars and cool stars with significant TiO bands. In\naddition, there are a few minor groups like carbon stars, some rare giants, cool dwarfs and some\nother peculiars. The first three groups offer the potential for further research due to their abundance\nand there is already an observational program under way to explore the most interesting spectra\nin more detail and also at other wavelengths not covered by RAVE. Particularly, the sample of\nchromospherically active stars seems interesting due to the link between the level of chromospheric\nactivity and stellar ages which can be exploited for age estimation. We plan to treat the spectra\nfrom peculiar groups in more detail in the series of forthcoming papers and add the classification\nflags to the future data releases.\nAll in all, we have demonstrated that LLE is a very appealing method when dealing with\nstellar or other types of astronomical spectra. With its relatively simple machinery it is able to\nrepresent the complex morphological properties of spectra in a very low dimension space, giving an\nopportunity for efficient discoveries of hidden features. We have also shown that this method can be\nused efficiently for consistent classification purposes without having to rely on external information.\nFunding for RAVE has been provided by: the Australian Astronomical Observatory; the\nLeibniz-Institut fuer Astrophysik Potsdam (AIP); the Australian National University; the Australian Research Council; the French National Research Agency; the German Research Foundation\n(SPP 1177 and SFB 881); the European Research Council (ERC-StG 240271 Galactica); the Istituto\nNazionale di Astrofisica at Padova; The Johns Hopkins University; the National Science Foundation\nof the USA (AST-0908326); the W.
