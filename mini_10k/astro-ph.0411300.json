Introduction\nOver the past few decades, as knowledge of the structure and\nnature of the stellar components of the Milky Way has increased, the level of complexity that has been revealed has\nalso risen. Not only must astronomers attempt to describe\nand quantify the global properties of our Galaxy, but they\nalso must contend with the presence (likely only partially\nrecognized at present) of real structures \u2013 coherent streams\narising from shredded dwarf galaxies, such as Sagittarius\n(e.g., Ibata et al. 1994; Majewski et al. 2003), and the still\npoorly-constrained Monoceros stream (Newberg et al. 2002;\nYanny et al. 2003; Ibata et al. 2003; Frinchaboy et al. 2004;\nSend offprint requests to: N. Christlieb,\ne-mail: nchristlieb@hs.uni-hamburg.de\n\u22c6 Based on observations collected at the European Southern\nObservatory, La Silla (Proposal No. 66.B-0054), and Kitt Peak\nNational and Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatories, operated by\nthe Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under\ncooperative agreement with the U.S. National Science Foundation.\n\nMartin et al. 2004), as well as the tidal tails of individual globular clusters (Dehnen et al. 2004, and references therein). Even\nwithin recognized stellar components, such as the thick disk,\nevidence exists for the presence of multiple populations, e.g.,\nthe so-called \"metal-weak thick disk\" (see Beers et al. 2002,\nand references therein) perhaps arising from stars donated to\nthe original thick disk by ravaged dwarf satellites. The overall shape of the inner and outer halo of the Galaxy are still\nnot well known, though most recent evidence suggests that the\nouter halo is at least somewhat flattened (e.g., Chiba & Beers\n2000; Helmi et al. 2003).\nIt is clear that, for progress to be made, further detailed\nexamination of the positions, motions, and chemical compositions of the stars of the Milky Way is required. Although not\nideal for examination of elemental abundances (due to their\nhigher temperatures, and hence weaker metallic lines), Field\nHorizontal-Branch (hereafter, FHB) stars can provide valuable\ntracers of the structure, kinematics, and dynamics of the halo\nand thick disk of the Galaxy. They are numerous throughout the\n\n\f2\n\nChristlieb et al.: HES FHB stars\n\nGalaxy, and sufficiently luminous to be identified up to large\ndistances from the Sun.\nOne immediate application of a large sample of tracers located throughout the halo of the Galaxy is the opportunity to obtain dynamical estimates of its total mass.\nWilkinson & Evans (1999) used the full set of 27 known satellite galaxies and globular clusters located at distances greater\nthan 20 kpc to explore this question. For six of these objects\nproper motions are known. This data was later supplemented\nby Sakamoto et al. (2003), who added some 400 FHB stars (at\ndistances less than 10 kpc) with available radial velocities, at\nleast 50 % of which also had available proper motions, in order to refine the mass estimate of the Galaxy. This sample was\nfurther expanded to include FHB stars from the early data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000),\nadding stars up to 75 kpc away (Beers et al. 2003). Most recently, Clewley et al. (2004) have identified a new sample of\n60 FHB stars located in six high Galactic latitude fields up\nto 50 kpc away, which will be combined with additional distant samples to obtain an improved estimate of the mass of the\nGalaxy.\nIn addition, FHB stars are of great importance as probes\nof the distances to High Velocity Clouds (HVCs). HVCs are\nclouds of neutral hydrogen at velocities incompatible with\nGalactic differential rotation (see Wakker 2004, for a recent\nreview). With HVCs, we might observe a continuous infall of\nmetal-poor (\u223c 1/10 solar) gas into the Galaxy, which dilutes\nthe interstellar medium (ISM) (Wakker et al. 1999). A clearer\nunderstanding of the nature of HVCs would therefore be important for modeling the chemical evolution of the Galaxy.\nDistances to HVCs can be determined by using stars\nof known distance in the line of sight to the clouds\n(Wakker & van Woerden 1997). Provided that the HVC under\nconsideration has a detectable metal content, one can observe\nabsorption lines of these metals at the velocity of the cloud in\nthe spectra of stars located behind the cloud, but these same\nlines would not be seen in the spectra of stars located in front\nof the cloud. Therefore, one can constrain the HVC distance by\nusing a sample of stars with different distances along the line of\nsight to the cloud. FHB stars are particularly well-suited for this\npurpose, because they are numerous, distant, and their spectra\nhave only very weak intrinsic absorption lines of metals.\nPreviously, the largest catalogues of candidate FHB stars\nhave come from objects selected on the basis of their distinctive appearance on objective-prism plates (e.g., the HK survey\nof Beers and collaborators; Beers et al. 1996). The HK survey possesses a magnitude limit, defined here as the B magnitude of the faintest objects present in the survey, of B \u2243 15.5,\nwith a corresponding distance limit for FHB stars on the order of 10 kpc from the Sun. In the Hamburg/ESO survey (HES;\nWisotzki et al. 1996, 2000), the fainter limiting magnitude of\nB \u2243 18.0 enables detection of FHB stars at distances of up to\n\u223c 30 kpc.\nColorimetric surveys, such as the SDSS, are now able\nto identify FHB candidates up \u2243 100 kpc away (Yanny et al.\n2000; Sirko et al. 2004). The 2MASS all-sky survey also provides a valuable resource for the colorimetric identification of\nFHB candidates. Brown et al. (2004), for example, show that\n\nFig. 1. Sample HES prism spectrum of a candidate FHB star.\nNote that wavelength increases from right to left. The sharp\ndrop at about 5400 \u00c5 is due to the sensitivity cutoff of the IIIaJ emulsion.\n\n2MASS JHK photometry can be used to efficiently select FHB\ncandidates out to 10 kpc from the Sun. These authors provide\na catalogue of some 100,000 FHB candidates located above\nGalactic latitude |b| = 15 deg (note, however, the contamination issues described below). Many more are identifiable at\nlower latitudes; however, the patchiness and increased overall\nlevel of interstellar reddening presents additional difficulties.\nThe 2MASS catalogues of FHB candidates provide a valuable\ncomplement to the SDSS approach, since the bright limit of\nSDSS (B \u2243 14.5) is similar to the faint limit of the 2MASS\nFHB candidates. In due course, the all-sky survey presently underway in the far-UV and near-UV with the GALEX mission\nwill provide another valuable source of FHB candidates.\nIt must be kept in mind that catalogues of FHB candidates can be easily confounded with high surface gravity A-type stars. A number of authors have pointed out that\nroughly 50 % of all stars with colors that fall in the same\nrange as FHB stars are in fact of this lower luminosity variety, many of which are likely to be halo blue stragglers\n(see, e.g., Norris & Hawkins 1991; Preston et al. 1991, 1994;\nWilhelm et al. 1999b). The majority of the so-called \"blue\nmetal poor\" stars of Preston et al. (1994) are also likely to\nbe blue stragglers (Preston & Sneden 2000). High-gravity Atype stars can be distinguished from lower gravity FHB stars\nthrough the use of broadband UBV photometry combined with\nmedium-resolution spectroscopy (Wilhelm et al. 1999a), due to\nthe large effect of surface gravity on the broadband U flux,\nand on the wings of the Balmer lines. Clewley et al. (2002) describe procedures that attempt to make this separation based on\nmedium-resolution spectroscopy alone.\nIn the HES we have attempted to select a clean sample of\nFHB candidates; that is, we wanted to keep the \"contamination\" with main-sequence stars as low as possible. If we can\ndemonstrate by representative follow-up observations that the\ncontamination is low, such a selection would allow us to isolate a large, statistical sample of FHBs, useful for many pur-\n\n\fChristlieb et al.: HES FHB stars\n\n3\n\nFig. 2.

In the left panel we show the learning sample of 228 stars before the classification is applied; in the right\npanel, crosses and dots denote the main-sequence and FHB stars that have been classified as main-sequence stars, respectively,\nand empty and full circles are the objects that have been classified as FHB stars.\n\nposes, directly from the HES data base, without the need of\nany follow-up observations.\n\nIn the first step of the procedure, we select all stars that lie\nin the colour range\n\nIn Section 2 we describe our procedure for selecting FHB\ncandidates. In Section 3, the results of the application of the\nselection algorithm to a major fraction of the HES data base\n(i.e., spectra from 329 out of a total of 380 HES fields) are\npresented. We also demonstrate that a low contamination with\nhigh-gravity A-stars can indeed be achieved with this selection.\nWe present our conclusions in Section 4.\n\n\u2212 0.2 < B \u2212 V < 0.3\n\n2. Selection of FHB candidates\nA-type stars are readily detectable in the HES due to their\nstrong Balmer lines (for an example see Figure 1). FHB candidates are selected in the HES in two steps. First, we apply B\u2212V\nand U \u2212 B cutoffs, and then we employ automatic spectral classification to seperate main-sequence from horizontal-branch\nstars. The classification is based on the Str\u00f6mgren c1 colour\nindex and the sum of the equivalent widths of the Balmer lines\nH\u03b2, H\u03b3 and H\u03b4. All of this information is derived directly from\nthe HES spectra. The calibrations of B\u2212V , U \u2212 B and c1 are accurate to 0.1, 0.09 and 0.15 mag, respectively (Christlieb et al.\n2001b). The Balmer line strengths are measured with an iterative algorithm in which a Gaussian profile is fitted to the lines\n(Christlieb et al. 2001b). We note that using a Gaussian profile\nmay lead to systematic underestimation of the strengths of the\nbroad lines of hot stars. However, for our FHB candidate selection, the internal consistency of the measured values rather than\ntheir absolute scale is important. We estimate the internal accuracy of the equivalent width sum H\u03b2 + H\u03b3 + H\u03b4, as measured\nfrom the HES spectra, to be on the order of a few \u00c5ngstr\u00f6ms.\n\n(1)\n\nand\n\u2212 0.3 < U \u2212 B < 0.5.\n\n(2)\n\nThe B \u2212V criterion selects all stars with effective temperatures\nin the range 7000 K . Teff . 10, 000 K, while allowing for an\nerror margin of 0.1 mag in B \u2212V . The U \u2212 B criterion was chosen to include most FHB stars, while a potential contamination\nwith DA white dwarfs is kept at a minimum (see Figure 13 of\nChristlieb et al. 2001b).\nIn order to develop a method for the separation of mainsequence from horizontal-branch stars, we investigated a set of\n259 HES spectra of stars that were analysed with the methods\nof Wilhelm et al. (1999a). This sample includes 214 stars from\nWilhelm et al. (1999b) present on the HES plates. The remaining 45 stars resulted from our own follow-up spectroscopy and\nphotometry of candidates selected with a preliminary selection\nalgorithm. From this set of stars, 31 were classified either as\n\"Am\" (i.e., metallic-line A-type stars), \"Ap\" (i.e., peculiar Atype stars), or \"FHB/A\" (i.e., no definitive conclusion could be\nreached as to whether these stars are on the horizontal-branch\nor are main-sequence stars). These were discarded, leaving 90\nhigh-gravity A-type stars and 138 FHB stars.\nInspection of the distribution of these stars in a c1 versus\nH\u03b2 + H\u03b3 + H\u03b4 diagram reveals that these two classes of objects\nare reasonably well separated in this feature space (see Figure\n2). We hence implemented an automatic spectral classification\nalgorithm that makes use of these two features. The classification forms the second step of our FHB candidate selection, i.e.,\n\n\f4\n\nChristlieb et al.: HES FHB stars\n\nit is applied only to the subset of the objects in the HES data\nbase that meet criteria (1) and (2).\nA detailed description of the classification algorithm can be\nfound in Christlieb et al. (2001a). The above described sample\nof 90 confirmed high-gravity A-type stars and 138 FHB stars is\nused as a training set. Based on this sample, the probability distributions for objects being member of one of the two classes,\ngiven their c1 and Balmer line equivalent width sums, are estimated. These so-called class-conditional probability distributions are modeled by two-dimensional Gaussian distributions.\nThis results in iso-probability lines in the two-dimensional feature space which have the shapes of ellipses, with their center being located at the point with the coordinates of the class\nmeans of c1 and H\u03b2 + H\u03b3+ H\u03b4. For example, the mean of c1 for\nthe main-sequence stars in the left panel of Figure 2 is 0.7 mag,\nand for the Balmer line sum it is 19 \u00c5.\n\nFig. 3. Adjusting the cost factor t2o by evaluating the classifcation results. For further explanation see text.\n\nOur statistical classification requires an estimation of the\nprior probabilities of the two classes considered here, i.e.,\nmain-sequence or FHB star. Wilhelm et al. (1999b) analysed\na sample of 1121 A-type stars selected from HK survey plates.\nWe consider it to be a representative flux-limited sample at high\ngalactic latitude, and use it to estimate the prior probabilities of\n\"FHB\" and \"A\" stars in the HES. Wilhelm et al. (1999b) find\n416 \"FHB\" and 444 \"A\" stars in their sample. Therefore, we\nestimate the prior probabilities for these stars to be 0.396 and\n0.371 in the HES, respectively.\nAny given object with measured values for c1 and H\u03b2 +\nH\u03b3 + H\u03b4 can then be assigned to one of the two classes with\nvarious decision rule. If the so-called Bayes' rule is used, an\nobject is assigned to the class with the highest posterior probability, given its values of the two features. This decision rule\nresults in \"dividing lines\" in the two-dimensional feature space\nthat have the shape of a polynomial of second order (hence this\nclassification method is called \"quadratic discriminant analy-\n\nsis\"). From looking at the right panel of Figure 2, one can have\na presentiment of the parabola-shaped selection boundary for\nour classification problem.\nClassification with Bayes' rule minimizes the total number of misclassifications, if the true distributions of the classconditional probabilities are used. However, in our case our\nclassification aim is to compile a clean sample of FHB stars,\nwhich is different from minimizing the total number of misclassifications, because different classification errors will have\ndifferent weight. For example, a misclassification of a highgravity A-type star as an FHB star is worse for the compilation\nof a clean sample than a misclassification in the other direction.\nIn order to to reach our aims, we have employed a so-called\nminimum cost rule classification, which minimizes the total\ncost. Here, every misclassified object causes a cost, while a correctly classified object is cost-neutral. The choice of cost factors determines the relative weight of misclassifications from\none class to another. As described in Christlieb et al. (2001a),\nthe cost factor t2o determines the cost for misclassifications\nof an object of the target class ('t') to ('2') one of the other\nclasses ('o'). With the cost factor o2t, the cost for the contamination of the target class is adjusted, and o2o is the cost factor for misclassifications between other classes. Since we are\nhere only dealing with two classes \u2013 that is, the target class of\nFHB stars, and high-gravity A-type stars \u2013 the cost factor o2o\ndoes not have any meaning. Therefore, effectively only one\ncost factor has to be chosen. As explained in Christlieb et al.\n(2001a), only the relative cost factor values need to be adjusted. Therefore, we set o2t to a fixed value of 1.0 and investigated the classification results as a function of t2o, with\n0.0 \u2264 t2o \u2264 1.0. The result is shown in Figure 3.\nWe define the quality q of the classification as the completeness rate minus the contamination rate. This gives q = 100 %\nfor the perfect classification with respect to our classification\naim, i.e., 100 % completeness (all FHB stars classified correctly) and 0 % contamination (no high-gravity A-type star erroneously classified as an FHB star). The highest value of q\nwhich is reachable is a measure of how well the objects of the\ntarget class can be seperated from objects of the other class(es).\nIn our case, the highest quality is achieved at t2o \u223c 0.9.\nHowever, we decided to adopt t2o = 0.5 for our classification, in order to keep the high-gravity A-type star contamination below 15 %. Estimates of the expected error rates with the\nleaving-one-out method (for a description see Christlieb et al.\n2001b) for the adopted value of t2o yield an expected completeness of the FHB sample of 73 %.\n\n3. Results\n3.1. Application to 329 HES fields\nApplication of our selection algorithm to the 329 HES fields\nthat are currently used for the exploitation of the stellar content of the HES yielded 8321 FHB candidates. As we argue\nin Section 3.2 below, statistically more than \u223c 6800 of these\nare expected to be genuine FHB stars. The distribution of these\nobjects on the sky is shown in Figure 4. In Table A.1 we list,\nfor the entire sample, photometry (UBV , c1 ), and Balmer line\n\n\fChristlieb et al.: HES FHB stars\n\n5\n\nFig. 4.

Distance distribution of the FHB candidate sample of\n8321 stars, assuming that they are all indeed FHB stars.\n\nWe determined the distance distribution of the sample by\nassuming that all candidates are indeed FHB stars. Strictly\nspeaking, this assumption is not valid, because our candidate\nsample will contain some non-FHB stars. However, this would\nchange the distance distribution noticably only if the apparent\nmagnitude distribution of the non-FHB contaminants were significantly different from that of the FHB stars (for which we do\nnot have any indication from our sample of non-FHB stars in\nour training set), and if the fraction of contaminants were high\n(we will demonstrate the opposite below). The reddening of\nthe stars was deduced from the maps of Schlegel et al. (1998),\nusing the empirical formula of Beers et al. (2002) to correct\nfor the suspected overestimate of the reddening by Schlegel et\nal. in the cases were E(B \u2212 V ) > 0.1. This correction had to\nbe applied to only 6 % of our stars; the average reddening of\nour sample is only E(B \u2212V ) = 0.046. Therefore, the extinction\n\ncorrections are negligible (i.e., the distances would change on\naverage by \u223c 2 %) compared to other sources of error in our\nrough distance estimates.\nEstimates of the absolute visual magnitudes, MV , of our\nFHB candidates are obtained following the procedures of\nPreston et al. (1991). These authors assembled a mean MV\nversus B \u2212 V relation for blue horizontal branch stars in 15\nGalactic globular clusters, normalized relative to an assumed\nabsolute magnitude of RR Lyrae stars in each cluster. The\nmetallicity dependence is accounted for using the corrections\nof Clementini et al. (1999) for RR Lyrae stars. Since [Fe/H] is\nnot available for the full sample of HES FHB candidates, we\nassume that they all have the average value of Wilhelm et al.\n(1999b), i.e., [Fe/H] = \u22121.9. The correction is 0.36 mag with\nrespect to assuming solar metallicity (that is, the absolute V\nmagnitudes of the metal-poor FHB stars are brighter by this\namount), resulting in distances increased by 18 %. We then use\nthe de-reddened HES B \u2212V colours and V magnitudes to compute distance moduli, taking into account extinction.\nThe average distance of our sample, assuming that all of\nthe candidates are FHB stars, is 9.8 kpc, while distances of up\nto 30 kpc are reached (see Figure 5).\n\n3.2. Contamination with high-gravity A-type stars\nFor 125 stars of our sample that are not part of the learning sample we have taken moderate-resolution (\u223c 2 \u00c5) spectra with the CTIO 4 m/RCS in December 1999, and the ESO\n3.6 m/EFOSC2 in November 2000. The spectra have signal-tonoise ratios of S/N > 20 per pixel at Ca II K. After the standard\nCCD reductions, the algorithm of Horne (1986) was employed\nto extract the spectra in order to maximize their S/N. UBV photometry was obtained at the ESO-Danish 1.54 m with DFOSC\nin observing runs in November 1998 and November 2000. The\nresults of the photometry runs will be reported in Beers et al.\n(in preparation).\nThe spectra and photometry was analysed with the method\nof Wilhelm et al. (1999a), in which the observed Balmer line\nprofiles, equivalent widths of Ca II K, and UBV photometry\n\n\f6\n\nChristlieb et al.: HES FHB stars\n\nTable 1.

This technique allows the estimations of effective temperature Teff , surface gravity log g, and metallicity [Fe/H] with\naccuracies of \u03c3 (Teff ) = \u00b1250 K, \u03c3 (log g) = \u00b10.14 dex, and\n\u03c3 ([Fe/H]) = \u00b10.12 dex, which permits one to reliably seperate main-sequence A-type stars from FHB stars.\nThe result is shown in Table 1. A total of 103 stars (or 82 %)\nwere confirmed to be FHB stars, and a further 5 stars were classified as \"FHB/A\" stars. Since the \"FHB/A\" stars could be either \"FHB\" or \"A\" stars, the total fraction of FHB stars lies in\nthe range 82\u201386 %. A total of 15 stars (or 12 %) were classified \"A\" by the method of Wilhelm et al. (1999a), yielding a\ntotal contamination of 12\u201316 %, which agrees very well with\nthe contamination of \u223c 15 % expected from the training of the\nclassifier applied to the HES data base.\n\n4. Conclusions\nThis large sample of HES FHB candidates, homogeneously\ndistributed over the high-Galactic latitude sky, is of great value\nfor studies of the structure and kinematics of the Galactic halo.\nThe stars are also being used as distance probes for HVCs. In a\nforthcoming paper we will report on a cross-correlation of the\nsample with HVC moment maps generated from data of the H I\nParkes All-Sky Survey (Thom et al., in preparation).\nThis sample of HES FHB candidates is expected to contain\na contamination with main-sequence A-type stars of less than\n16 %, so that for many studies the stars can be used directly,\nwithout the need for extensive follow-up observations to further\nrefine the classifications.\nAcknowledgements.
