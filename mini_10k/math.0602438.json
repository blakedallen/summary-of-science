This conjecture predicts specific uniform bounds in the homogeneous polynomial case of exponential sums modulo pm when p and m vary.

We obtain natural lower bounds for the motivic oscillation index by using\nresults of Segers. We also show that, for p big enough, Igusa's local zeta function has\na nontrivial pole when there are Fp -rational singular points on f = 0. We introduce\na new invariant of f , the flaw of f .\n\n1. Introduction\nLet f be a polynomial over Q in n variables. Consider the \"global\" exponential\nsums\nX\n1\nf (x)\nEf (N) := n\n),\nexp(2\u03c0i\nN\nN\nn\nx\u2208{0,...,N \u22121}\n\nwhere N varies over the positive integers. Up to prime factorization of N, to study\nthe dependence of Ef (N) on N it suffices to study Ef (pm ) in terms of integers m > 0\nand primes p, which requires a mixture of finite field and p-adic techniques.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. - Primary 11L07, 11S40; Secondary 11L05,\n11U09.\nKey words and phrases. - Igusa's conjecture on exponential sums, p-adic exponential sums,\nfinite field exponential sums, Igusa's local zeta function, p-adic cell decomposition, motivic oscillation index, flaw.\n*During the realization of this project, the author was a postdoctoral fellow of the Fund for Scientific Research - Flanders (Belgium) (F.W.O.) and was supported by The European Commission\n- Marie Curie European Individual Fellowship with contract number HPMF CT 2005-007121.\n\n\f2\n\nRAF CLUCKERS\n\nIgusa's conjecture predicts sharp bounds for |Ef (pm )| in terms of integers m > 0\nand primes p when f is homogeneous. Analogue conjectures for analogue sums over\nfinite field extensions of Q also make sense. Fixing m = 1 or m = 2, the conjectured\nuniformity in p gives a link between finite field and p-adic exponential sums.\nIn any case, to find sharp bounds for |Ef (pm )| for fixed p uniformly in m is\noften much more easy than bounding uniformly in p and m. Using a resolution of\nsingularities \u03c0 as below, Igusa defines a rational number \u03b1 = \u03b1(\u03c0) \u2264 0 such that\n(1.0.1)\n\n|Ef (pm )| < cp mn\u22121 pm\u03b1\n\nfor each m, each prime p, and some constants cp depending on p. When f is\nhomogeneous, he conjectures in [14] that cp can be taken independently of p.\n. - Let us define the number \u03b1(\u03c0) that is used in (1.0.1) for any polynomial f over\nQ, following Igusa [14], or [13], [10]. If f is a constant, put \u03b1(\u03c0) := 0. Otherwise,\nlet\n\u03c0f : Y \u2192 AnC\nbe an embedded resolution of singularities with normal crossings of f = 0. Let\n(Ni , \u03bdi ), i \u2208 I, be the numerical data of \u03c0f , that is, for each irreducible component\nEi of f \u25e6 \u03c0f = 0, i \u2208 I, let Ni be the multiplicity of Ei in div(f \u25e6 \u03c0f ), and \u03bdi \u2212 1 the\nmultiplicity of Ei in the divisor associated to \u03c0f\u2217 (dx) with dx = dx1 \u2227 ... \u2227 dxn . The\nessential numerical data of \u03c0f are the pairs (Ni , \u03bdi ) for i \u2208 J with J = I \\ I \u2032 and\nwhere I \u2032 is the set of indices i in I such that (Ni , \u03bdi ) = (1, 1) and such that Ei does\nnot intersect another Ej with (Nj , \u03bdj ) = (1, 1). Define \u03b1(\u03c0f ) as\n\u03bdi\n\u03b1(\u03c0f ) = \u2212 min\ni\u2208J Ni\nwhen J is nonempty and define \u03b1(\u03c0f ) as \u22122n otherwise. Take a similar resolution\n\u03c0f \u2212c of f \u2212 c = 0 for each critical value c \u2208 C of f : Cn \u2192 C and put \u03c0 := (\u03c0f \u2212c )c\nwhere c runs over {0} and the critical values of f . Define\n\u03b1(\u03c0) := max(\u03b1(\u03c0f \u2212c )),\nc\n\nwhere c runs over {0} and the critical values of f . Note that the number \u03b1(\u03c0) often\ndepends on \u03c0, [17]. Namely, \u03b1(\u03c0) is independent of the choice of \u03c0 when \u03b1(\u03c0) \u2265 \u22121\nby properties of the logcanonical threshold of f \u2212 c for all c, but on the other hand,\nwhen \u03b1(\u03c0) < \u22121, then \u03b1(\u03c0) always depends on the choice of \u03c0, see Remark 1.2.\n. - Now we are ready to state (a slightly generalized form of) what Igusa conjectured in the introduction of his book of 1978:\n1.1. Conjecture ([14]). - Suppose that f is a homogeneous polynomial over Q\nin n variables. Let \u03c0 and \u03b1(\u03c0) be as above.(1) Then there exists a constant c such\n(1)\n\nFor homogeneous f one has \u03c0 = (\u03c0f ) since 0 is the only possible critical value of f by Euler's\nidentity.\n\n\fIGUSA'S CONJECTURE ON EXPONENTIAL SUMS\n\n3\n\nthat for each prime p and each positive integer m one has\n|Ef (pm )| < c mn\u22121 pm\u03b1(\u03c0) .\nThis conjecture might hold for a much wider class of polynomials than homogeneous ones, for example, for quasi-homogeneous polynomials. It is an open question\nhow to generalize the conjecture optimally to the case of general f , cf. Example 7.2\nand section 8 below.\nIn certain cases Conjecture 1.1 is proved. Igusa proved the case that the projective hypersurface defined by f is smooth [14], by using Deligne's bounds in [7] for\nfinite field exponential sums. The case that \u03c0 is a toric resolution and f is nondegenerate with respect to its Newton polyhedron at the origin is proven under special\nconditions by Denef and Sperber in [12], and in full generality by the author in [2].\n. - In this paper we prove Igusa's Conjecture 1.1 when we fix m = 1, resp. m = 2,\nsee Corollary 6.2. Actually, we prove a bit more:\n1) instead of using \u03b1(\u03c0), we define and use an exponent \u03b1f , the motivic\noscillation index of f , which is intrinsically associated to f and at least\nas sharp and sometimes sharper than \u03b1(\u03c0) since \u03b1f \u2264 \u03b1(\u03c0);\n2) for m = 2 the conjecture holds for arbitrary f ;\n3) when we restrict to big enough primes p we prove the analogue bounds\nfor all finite field extensions of the fields Qp and all fields Fq ((t)) of\ncharacteristic p.\nThe motivic oscillation index \u03b1f is defined and studied in section 3; this notion is\nbased on a suggestion made to us by Jan Denef. In particular, we show that (1.0.1)\nholds with \u03b1 = \u03b1f instead of \u03b1 = \u03b1(\u03c0).\n. - For arbitrary polynomials f in n variables over some number field, we establish\nin Theorem 5.1 the lower bound\n\u2212n + \u03b4f\n\u2264 \u03b1f ,\n2\nwhere \u03b4f is the dimension of the locus of grad f , where we say that the empty scheme\nhas dimension \u2212\u221e. It is proven by showing in Theorem 2.2 that for big enough p\nIgusa's local zeta function has a nontrivial pole if and only if there is a Fp -rational\npoint on grad f = f = 0 (Theorem 2.2) and by using the lower bounds of Segers [18]\nfor the isolated singularity case in combination with a Cartesian product argument\non integrals.\nHaving this lower bound for \u03b1f , Conjecture 1.1 with m = 1 fixed follows from\nupper bounds given by Katz [15] for exponential sums over finite fields of large\ncharacteristic. The case m = 2 follows elementarily from Hensel's Lemma and\nbounds on the number of Fq -rational points on grad f = 0.\n\n\f4\n\nRAF CLUCKERS\n\nThe analogue results over the fields Fq ((t)) of big enough characteristic just follow\nfrom a comparison principle coming from the theory of motivic integration, named\ntransfer principle, cf. [4], [6], or with some work from [10].\nIn Theorem 7.1 we generalize our results for homogeneous polynomials to arbitrary polynomials satisfying Condition (7.0.1) which relates the singluarities at\ninfinity in Pn with the singularities in affine space.\nIn section 8 we slightly sharpen Igusa's conjecture by using \u03b1f instead of \u03b1(\u03c0).\nIn general, \u03b1f might not be the only ingredient for sharp bounds, so we introduce a\nnew invariant of a polynomial f , the flaw of f , for the study of uniform bounds for\n|Ef (pm )|.\n1.2. Remark. - When \u03b1(\u03c0) < \u22121, then \u03b1(\u03c0) depends on the choice of \u03c0, as is\ncommunicated to the author by Segers and Veys [17]. Namely, let E be an exceptional irreducible component (for \u03c0) with numerical data (N, \u03bd) which intersects\nan irreducible component S of the strict transform. The numerical data of S is\nautomatically of the form (NS , 1), since it is a component of the strict transform.\nSince \u03b1(\u03c0) < \u22121, we find that NS = 1 and that \u2212\u03bd/N < \u22121. Performing one\nmore blowing up with center the intersection of E and S yields a new exceptional\ncomponent with numerical data (N + 1, \u03bd + 1), which still intersects an irreducible\ncomponent of the strict transform. Repeating this process with finitely many steps\nyields an alternative tuple of resolutions (\u03c0 \u2032 ) with \u03b1(\u03c0) < \u03b1(\u03c0 \u2032 ) < \u22121, and with\nmoreover \u03b1(\u03c0 \u2032 ) as close to \u22121 as one wants.\nSome notation. - Let k be a number field and let f be a polynomial over k in\nn variables. Define \u03b1(\u03c0) for a tuple \u03c0 of embedded resolutions of polynomials f \u2212 c\nas in the introduction. Let Ak be the collection of all finite field extensions of p-adic\ncompletions of k. For K \u2208 Ak , let OK be its valuation ring with maximal ideal MK\nand residue field kK with qK elements, and let \u03c8K be any additive character(2) from\nK to C\u00d7 which is trivial on OK and nontrivial on some element of order \u22121.

We\ncan consider f as a polynomial over Ok [1/N] for some large enough integer N, and\nhence, for K \u2208 Bk,N , the polynomial f makes sense as a polynomial over K and\nEf,K,\u03c6 is defined as the corresponding integral for any Schwartz-Bruhat function \u03c6\non K n ; for K \u2208 Bk of characteristic \u2264 N, Ef,K,\u03c6 is defined to be zero.\nThe Vinogradov symbol \u226a has its usual meaning, namely that for complex valued\nfunctions f and g with g taking non-negative real values f \u226a g means |f | \u2264 cg for\nsome constant c.\nBy [13], Proposition 2.7, one has for any K in Ak \u222a Bk,M for big enough M that\n|Ef,K,\u03c6 (y)| \u226a |vK (y)|n\u22121|y|\u03b1(\u03c0)\n\n(1.2.1)\n\nfor any \u03c0 as above, where both sides are considered as functions in y \u2208 K \u00d7 and\n|vK (y)| denotes the real absolute value of vK (y).\nLet Cf be the closed subscheme of Ank given by 0 = grad f and let \u03b4f be the\ndimension of Cf , where we say that the empty scheme has dimension \u2212\u221e. Let Sf\nbe the closed subscheme of Ank given by f = 0 = grad f and let \u03b5f be the dimension\nof Sf . If f is a polynomial over Ok [1/N] for some N, then for any ring R which is\nan algebra over Ok [1/N], denote the set of R-rational points on Cf by Cf (R), and\nlikewise on Sf . Use similar notation for polynomials over other fields than k.\n\n2. Igusa's local zeta function has nontrivial poles\nFollowing Shavarevitch, Borevitch, Igusa, and others, for f a nonconstant polynomial in n variables over Ok and for K in Ck , consider the Poincar\u00e9 series\nX\nPf,K (T ) :=\nNf,K,mT m\nm\u2208N\n\nwith\nNf,K,m :=\n\n1\nmn\nqK\n\nn\nm\n\u266f{x \u2208 (OK mod Mm\nK ) | f (x) \u2261 0 mod MK }.\n\nFor K \u2208 Ak it is known that Pf,K (T ) is rational in T , see [14] and [8]. Also for\nK \u2208 Bk,M for M big enough, Pf,K (T ) is rational in T , shown using resolutions with\ngood reduction [9], [10], or by insights of motivic integration, cf. [11] or [4].(4)\n(3)\n\nFor k = Q, K = Qp , and \u03c8K the standard nontrivial additive character, one thus has\nEf,K (p\u2212m ) = Ef (pm ).\n(4)\nIt is conjectured that Pf,K (T ) is rational for all K \u2208 Bk .\n\n\fRAF CLUCKERS\n\n6\n\n2.1. Definition. - For K in CQ and QK (T ) a rational function over Q in T define\nthe nontrivial poles of QK (T ) as the poles of QK (T ) without the pole T = qK if this\nis a pole of multiplicity exactly 1.\n2.2. Theorem. - Let f be a nonconstant polynomial in n variables over k. There\nexists a number M such that for all K \u2208 Ck,M , the rational function Pf,K (T ) has a\nnontrivial pole if and only if Sf (kK ) is nonempty, with Sf (kK ) as in the section on\nnotation.\nProof. - For M big enough and for K in Ak,M , if Sf (kK ) is nonempty, then Sf (OK )\nis nonempty and thus Nf,K,m 6= 0 for all m. Hence, Pf,K (T ) has at least one pole.\nIn [9] it is shown that for M big enough and K \u2208 Ak,M , the degree of Pf,K (T ) in\nT is \u2264 0. Hence, the same holds for K \u2208 Bk,M with M big enough. So, in the case\nthat Pf,K (T ) has only T = qK as pole, if this pole has multiplicity 1, and if K lies\nin Ck,M with M big enough, we can write\n\u22121\nPf,K (T ) = (AK + BK T )/(1 \u2212 qK\nT ),\n\nfor some rational numbers AK and BK depending on K. By developing the right\nhand side into series we get\n\u22121\nNf,K,1 = qK\nAK + BK\n\nand\n\u22122\n\u22121\n\u22121\nNf,K,2 = qK\nAK + qK\nBK = qK\nNf,K,1 .\n\u22121\nWe will only use that qK Nf,K,1 = Nf,K,2. Let f \u0304 be the reduction of f modulo MK .\nPut\nn\nYK,f := {x \u2208 kK\n| f \u0304(x) = 0 6= (grad f \u0304)(x)}.\n\nSuppose now that Sf (kK ) is nonempty.

This gives a contradiction with\n\u22121\nqK\nNf,K,1 = Nf,K,2.\n\u0001n\nThis is so because the projection {x \u2208 k[t]/(t2 ) | f (x) \u2261 0 mod t2 } \u2192 {x \u2208 k n | f (x) = 0} is\nsurjective for k any field of characteristic zero. Alternatively, this follows from Greenleaf's theorem,\ncf. [1].\n(5)\n\n\fIGUSA'S CONJECTURE ON EXPONENTIAL SUMS\n\n7\n\n2.3. Remark. - By an observation of Igusa, cf.

Definition and basic properties of the oscillation indices\n3.1. - Let f be a polynomial in n variables over a number field k, let K be in Ck ,\nand let \u03c6 : K n \u2192 C be a Schwartz-Bruhat function. Define \u03b1f,K,\u03c6 as the infimum\nin R \u222a {\u2212\u221e} of all real numbers \u03b1 satisfying\nEf,K,\u03c6 (y) \u226a |y|\u03b1K ,\nwhere both sides are considered as functions in y \u2208 K \u00d7 . Note that \u03b1f,K,\u03c6 \u2264 0\nbecause \u03b1 = 0 always satisfies the previous Vinogradov inequality. Define \u03b1f,K as\nthe supremum of the \u03b1f,K,\u03c6 when \u03c6 varies over all Schwartz-Bruhat functions on\nK n . Call \u03b1f,K the K-oscillation index of f .\n3.2.

(3.5.1) below.\n3.4. Corollary. - For all K in Ak \u222a Bk,M with M big enough there exists \u03c6 such\nthat\n\u03b1f,K,\u03c6 = \u03b1f,K ,\nand for all N there exists K in Ak,N and L in Bk,N such that\n\u03b1f = \u03b1f,K = \u03b1f,L .\nMoreover, the following list of a priori inequalities holds\n(3.4.1)\n\n\u2212 \u221e \u2264 \u03b1f,K,\u03c6 \u2264 \u03b1f,K \u2264 \u03b1f \u2264 \u03b1(\u03c0) \u2264 0\n\nfor big M, any K in Ck,M and any Schwartz-Bruhat function \u03c6 on K n .\n\n\fRAF CLUCKERS\n\n8\n\nProof. - The existence of L follows from the motivic understanding of exponential\nintegrals over K n for K varying in Ck,M for M big enough, as established in [4]\n(equivalently, one can use [10]). The inequality \u03b1f \u2264 \u03b1(\u03c0) follows from (1.2.1).\nAlthough the \u03b1f,K,\u03c6 are defined as infima, they yield actual bounds, analogous\nto (1.0.1) and (1.2.1):\n3.5.

Namely, by [13], Proposition 2.7, for K \u2208 Ak and for y with\n|y| big enough, one can write Ef,K,\u03c6 (y) as a finite C-linear combination of terms of\nthe form\n(3.5.1)\n\n\u03c7(y)|y|\u03bbvK (y)\u03b2 \u03c8(cy)\n\nwith c \u2208 K a critical value of f , \u03c7 a character with finite image of K \u00d7 into the\ncomplex unit circle, \u03bb a complex number with negative real part, and \u03b2 an integer\nbetween 0 and n \u2212 1, where real parts of the occurring \u03bb are among the quotients\n\u2212\u03bdi /Ni with (Ni , \u03bdi ) the essential numerical data of some \u03c0 as above. From this the\nstatements follow for K \u2208 Ak .\nFor K in Bk,M one then uses the transfer principle of [4]. Namely, by this transfer\nprinciple it follows that for M big enough and for K in Bk,M , Ef,K,\u03c6 (y) can be\nwritten as a similar linear combination as given higher up in the proof for K in Ak .\n(The statement about Bk,M also follows from [10] and the existence of embedded\nresolutions of f = 0 with good reduction modulo p for p any prime bigger than some\nM, see also [9].)\nThe following Proposition essentially follows from Theorem 2.2 and [13], with Cf\nas in the section on notation.\n3.6.

The second statement follows from Theorem\n2.2 applied to some K and one of the polynomials f \u2212 c with c \u2208 C a critical value\nof f with c \u2208 K and from the fact that any nontrivial pole of Pf,K (T ) effectively\nappears as \u03bb in one of the terms (3.5.1) when writing Ef,K (y) as a linear combination\nof terms as (3.5.1), by Proposition 2.7 of [13].\n\n4. A lemma on parameterized integrals\nLet LDP be the language of Denef-Pas, consisting of three sorts: valued field,\nresidue field and value group, and the language of fields for the residue field, the\nlanguage of fields for the valued field, the language of ordered additive groups for\nthe value group, and the extra symbols ac and ord.\nLet k be a number field. Consider the language LDP (k), which is the language\nLDP together with coefficients for k in the valued and residue field sort. On a\nfield K \u2208 Ak , the symbols of LDP (k) have their natural meaning, where ac(x) for\n\u2212ordx\nnonzero x \u2208 K is interpreted as x\u03c0K\nmod MK in the residue field kK , for some\n(consequent) choice of uniformizer \u03c0K of OK and where ac(0) = 0. Note that the\nlanguage LDP can be naturally interpreted in L((t)) for any field L in a similar way.\nThen, by quantifier elimination results by Pas [16], for any given LDP (k)-formula\n\u03c6 there exists a LDP (k)-formula \u03c6\u2032 without valued field quantifiers such that for all\nK \u2208 Ak,M with M big enough, \u03c6 and \u03c6\u2032 determine the same set over K.\nBy a basic step function on K n with K in Ak we mean a characteristic function\nof a Cartesian product of factors of the form OK and a + MK for a \u2208 OK . For\nexample, the characteristic function of OK \u00d7 MK \u00d7 (1 + MK )n\u22122 is a basic step\nfunction on K n .\nThe goal of this section is to prove the following lemma.\n4.1. Lemma. - Let k be a number field and let f be a polynomial in the variables\nx1 , . . . , xn over k. Write x\u0302 for x2 , . . . , xn . Then there are M > 0 and a polynomial\ng in one variable over k such that for all a \u2208 k with g(a) 6= 0, all K \u2208 Ak,M , and\nall basic step functions \u03c6 on K n\u22121 , one has that\nZ\n\u03c6(x\u0302)|f (b, x\u0302)|s |dx\u0302|,\nIK (b, s, \u03c6) :=\nn\u22121\nOK\n\nwith s > 0 a real variable and |dx\u0302| the normalized Haar measure, is independent of\nb \u2208 a + MK .\nProof. - We give a proof based on motivic integration and constructible functions\nas developed in [5]. By [5] (or already with some work by Pas [16]), there are\nLDP (k)-formulas such that their interpretation in K with K a field in Ak,M with M\nbig enough yields functions\n\u03b1i (K), \u03b2i (K) : K \u2192 Z\n\n\fRAF CLUCKERS\n\n10\n\nand definable subsets\n(n\u22121)+l\n\nAi (K) \u2282 K \u00d7 kK\n\nof K times a power of the residue field of K such that the following holds for K\nin Ak,M with M big enough: with \u03c6z the characteristic function of the product of\nn\u22121\nthe residue classes mod MK of z = (z2 , . . . , zn ) \u2208 kK\n, one has that IK (b, s, \u03c6z ) for\nb \u2208 K is a Q-linear combination of products of factors of the form\n\u0001\nl\naiz (K) := \u266f Ai (K) \u2229 {b} \u00d7 {z} \u00d7 kK\n,\n\u03b1 (K)s+\u03b2i (K)\n\nqKi\n\n,\n\n1\n,\nas+b\n1 \u2212 qK\nand\n\u03b2i (K),\nwith integers (a, b) 6= (0, 0). We show that the aiz (K), \u03b1i (K), and \u03b2i (K), are\nconstant on a + MK for all a with g(a) 6= 0 for some polynomial g over k, uniformly\nin K in Ak,M . But this follows at once from Lemma 4.4. For basic step functions\nwhich also involve the characteristic function of Cartesian products with OK one\nworks similarly, say, with some more (witnessing) z-variables. The Lemma then\nfollows.\n4.2. Definition (One dimensional Cells). - Let L be any field of characteristic zero. Let X \u2282 L((t)) be a LDP (k)-definable set and\nf :X\u2192S\nc : S \u2192 L((t))\nLDP (k)-definable functions, with S a Cartesian product of some power of L and\nsome power of Z. The tuple (X, f, c) is called a (1)-cell with presentation f and\ncenter c when for each s \u2208 f (X), there exists \u03be \u2208 L\u00d7 and a \u2208 Z such that the fiber\nf \u22121 (s) is an open ball of the form\n{x \u2208 L((t)) | ac(x \u2212 c(s)) = \u03be \u2227 ord(x \u2212 c(s)) = a}.\nThe tuple (X, f, c) is called a (0)-cell with presentation f and center c when c \u25e6 f is\nthe identity on X.\n4.3. Lemma ([16], [3], One Dimensional Cell decomposition)\nLet k be a number field and L a field over k. Let gj be polynomials in 1 variable\nover k. Then L((t)) can be written as the disjoint union of finitely many LDP (k)definable cells Xi with LDP (k)-definable presentations fi and LDP (k)-definable centers ci such that for each i, j the restrictions ordgj|Xi and acgj|Xi factorize through\nfi . Moreover, the formulas describing the Xi , fi , and ci can be taken independently\nof L.\n\n\fIGUSA'S CONJECTURE ON EXPONENTIAL SUMS\n\n11\n\nProof. - This form of Denef - Pas cell decomposition is proven in [3] with k =\nQ, where it is a relative cell decomposition relative to Zl \u00d7 Ll under the map\n(ord(gj ), ac(gj ))j . The Lemma for general k follows easily from it by first replacing\nthe parameters from k by variables, then applying the form of [3] to all the variables,\nand then plugging in the parameters for the variables again.\n4.4. Corollary. - Let the functions aiz (K), \u03b1i (K), and \u03b2i (K) be as in the proof\nof Lemma 4.1. Then there are M > 0 and a polynomial g in one variable over k\nn\u22121\nsuch that for all a \u2208 k with g(a) 6= 0, all K \u2208 Ak,M and all z \u2208 kK\none has that\nthese functions aiz (K), \u03b1(K), and \u03b2(K) are constant functions in the variable b\nwhen b runs over a + MK .\nProof. - Let gl be the polynomials in one valued field variable that occur in the\nvalued field quantifier free formulas that describe the \u03b1i , \u03b2i , and Ai . Apply Lemma\n4.3 for the polynomials gl to find cells Xj with centers cj and presentations fj .\nBy quantifier elimination in the language LDP (k) and by examining valued field\nquantifier free formulas in one free valued field variables, it follows that the images\nof the centers cj are contained in the zero set of a polynomial g over k. Now the\ncorollary follows from the definition of cells and the evident ultraproduct argument\nto go to K in Ak,M for M big enough. Namely, for a \u2208 k with g(a) 6= 0, all\nK \u2208 Ak,M for M big, the set a + MK is contained in Xj (K) for some unique j, and\nfj (K)(a + MK ) is a singleton, where Xj (K) and fj (K) are the K-interpretations\nof Xj and fj .\n5. Estimation of the motivic oscillation index\nLet f be a polynomial in n variables over a number field k. Let Cf , Sf , \u03b4f , and \u03b5f\nbe as in the section on notation. Let \u03b1f be the motivic oscillation index as before.\n5.1. Theorem. - Let f be a polynomial in n variables over a number field k.\nThen\n\u2212n + \u03b4f\n(5.1.1)\n\u2264 \u03b1f .\n2\nProof. - Since one can always replace k by a finite field extension and f by f \u2212 a\nfor some critical value a \u2208 k, it is clear that it is enough to prove that\n\u2212n + \u03b5f\n(5.1.2)\n\u2264 \u03b1f .\n2\nWe may suppose that \u03b5f \u2265 0 since otherwise \u03b5f = \u2212\u221e and then (5.1.2) is trivial.\nWe then prove the following statement by induction on n when \u03b5f \u2265 0.\nFor each M there exist L in Ak,M , a basic step function \u03c6L on Ln (in\nthe sense of section 4), a real number s0 with\n\u2212n + \u03b5f\n\u2264 s0 \u2264 0,\n2\n\n\fRAF CLUCKERS\n\n12\n\nand a complex number t0 with real part qL\u2212s0 such that t0 is a nontrivial\npole (in the sense of Definition 2.1) of the rational function in T = qL\u2212s\ndefined for s > 0 by\nZ\nZf,L,\u03c6L (s) :=\n\u03c6L (x)|f (x)|s |dx|.\nLn\n\nThis statement implies (5.1.2) (since a nontrivial pole of Zf,L,\u03c6L (s) corresponds to\nan effectively appearing \u03bb in (5.1.1) by [13], Proposition 2.7).\nThe case that n = 1 is easy by explicit calculation using factorization of f into\nirreducible polynomials over the algebraic closure of k.\nFor n > 1, first suppose that \u03b5f = 0. Let M be big enough and choose L in\nAk,M such that Sf (kL ) is nonempty. By Theorem 2.2 and Remark 2.3 it follows that\nZf,L,\u03c6triv (s) has a nontrivial pole in qL\u2212s , with \u03c6triv the basic step function which is\nthe characteristic function of OLn . Since each complex pole t0 of Zf,L,\u03c6triv (s) with\nreal part qL\u2212s0 satisfies \u2212n/2 \u2264 s0 \u2264 0 when n > 1 by results by Segers [18], the\ncase that \u03b5f = 0 and n > 1 follows.\nNow we treat the case n > 1 and \u03b5f > 0. There is a coordinate, say x1 , such\nthat for infinitely many points a in the algebraic closure of k, \u03b5fa \u2265 \u03b5f \u2212 1, with fa\nthe polynomial in x\u0302 := (x2 , . . . , xn ) over k(a) defined by fa (x\u0302) = f (a, x\u0302). Indeed,\nsince \u03b5f > 0 there is a coordinate, say x1 , to which an irreducible component of Sf\nof dimension \u03b5f projects dominantly, and then one compares the equations defining\nSf and the Sfa . Let g be a polynomial in one variable as in Lemma 4.1 for the\npolynomial f . Then, by replacing k by a bigger field extension, we can suppose that\nthere is c \u2208 k such that g(c) 6= 0 and such that \u03b5fc \u2265 \u03b5f \u2212 1. Note that fc is a\npolynomial in n \u2212 1 variables. By the induction hypothesis, there exist L in Ak,M ,\na basic step function \u03c8L on Ln\u22121 and a real number s0 with\n\u2212n + \u03b5f\n\u2212(n \u2212 1) + (\u03b5f \u2212 1)\n\u2212(n \u2212 1) + \u03b5fc\n=\n\u2264\n\u2264 s0 \u2264 0\n2\n2\n2\nand a complex number with real part qL\u2212s0 which is a nontrivial pole of Zfc ,L,\u03c8L (s).\nNow let \u03c6L be the basic step function on Ln which is the product of the characteristic\nfunction of c + ML with \u03c8L . Then t0 is also a nontrivial pole of Zf,L,\u03c6L (s), since\nZf,L,\u03c6L (s) is a product integral by the above application of Lemma 4.1 to f and since\ng(c) 6= 0. Namely, Zf,L,\u03c6L (s) = qL\u22121 Zfc ,L,\u03c8L (s). This proves the above statement and\nthus the theorem.\n5.2.

Theorem. - Let f be a homogeneous polynomial in n variables over the number field k. Then there exists M > 0 and a constant c such that for each K in Ck,M\nand each y \u2208 K with vK (y) = \u22121 or vK (y) = \u22122 one has\n(6.1.1)\n\n\u03b1\n\n|Ef,K (y)| < c |y|Kf .\n\nMoreover, the statement for y with vK (y) = \u22122 holds for all polynomials over k.\nProof. - Let \u03b4f be as in the section on notation. First note that for homogeneous f\none has \u03b4f = \u2212\u221e if and only if f is linear, and, in the linear case one has \u03b1f = \u2212\u221e\nand Ef,K (y) = 0 for all K \u2208 Ck,M for M big enough and all y \u2208 K with vK (y) < 0.\nThe case that f is a constant is trivial, cf. Proposition 3.6.\nSuppose now that the degree of f is \u2265 2. Thus n > \u03b4f > \u2212\u221e. Let Hf be\nthe (not necessarily reduced) projectivization in Pnk of the closed subscheme of Ank\ngiven by f = 0, and let \u03b4 be the (projective) dimension of the singular locus of the\nintersection of Hf with the hyperplane at infinity. Then\n(6.1.2)\n\n\u03b4 + 1 = \u03b4f .\n\nThen, by Katz [15], Theorem 4, and by (6.1.2), there exist constants C and M such\nthat for all K in Ck,M and all y in K with vK (y) = \u22121 one has\n(6.1.3)\n\n\u2212n+\u03b4f\n2\n\n|Ef,K (y)| < CqK\n\n,\n\nwith qK the number of elements of the residue field of K. Together with (5.1.1) of\nTheorem 5.1 this implies the statement for y with vK (y) = \u22121.\nNow let f be a general polynomial over k in n variables. For K \u2208 Ck,M with M\nbig enough, define\nn\nAf (K) := {x \u2208 OK\n| grad f (x) \u2261 0 mod MK }\n\nand\nn\nBf (K) := {x \u2208 OK\n| grad f (x) 6\u2261 0 mod MK }.\nBy Noether's Normalization Theorem, the number of elements of the set Cf (kK ) is\n\u03b4\n\u2264 DqKf for some D independent of qK when the characteristic of kK is big enough.\nHence, there exists some M and D such that for all K in Ak,M the measure of Af (K)\nagainst the normalized Haar measure |dx| satisfies\nZ\n\u2212n+\u03b4\n|dx| \u2264 DqK f .\nAf (K)\n\nOn the other hand, for M big enough, K in Ak,M , and y \u2208 K with vK (y) = \u22122,\nZ\n0=\n\u03c8K (yf (x))|dx|K ,\nBf (K)\n\nby Hensel's Lemma and the fact that the sum\nX\n\u03c8q (z)\nz\u2208Fq\n\n\fRAF CLUCKERS\n\n14\n\nequals zero for any nontrivial additive character \u03c8q on Fq . Hence, for such M and\nK, and for all y in K with vK (y) = \u22122,\nZ\nZ\n|Ef,K (y)| = |\n\u03c8K (yf (x))|dx|K +\n\u03c8K (yf (x))|dx|K |\nAf (K)\nBf (K)\nZ\n= |\n\u03c8K (yf (x))|dx|K |\nAf (K)\nZ\n\u2264\n|dx|K\nAf (K)\n\n\u2212n+\u03b4\n\n(6.1.4)\n\n\u2264 DqK f\n\u2264 D|y|\u03b1f ,\n\n2\nwhere D is independent of K and where inequality (6.1.4) follows from |y| = qK\nand\n(5.1.1).\n\n6.2. Corollary. - Igusa's Conjecture 1.1 with argument of order \u22121 or \u22122 holds\nfor all homogeneous polynomials f over k. Namely, for f a homogeneous polynomial\nin n variables over k and \u03c0 = \u03c0f a resolution as in the introduction, there exists\na constant c such that for each p-adic completion K of k and each y \u2208 K with\nvK (y) = \u22121 or vK (y) = \u22122 one has\n\u03b1(\u03c0)\n\n|Ef,K (y)| < c |y|K .\nProof. - This follows from Theorem 6.1 and (3.4.1) for big residue characteristics,\nand from (1.2.1) for small residue characteristics.\n6.3. Remark. - The factor |vK (y)|n\u22121 featuring in the original conjecture clearly\nbecomes unnecessary when one focuses on y with vK (y) = \u22121 and vK (y) = \u22122.\nWhen vK (y) varies over Z, the factor |vK (y)|n\u22121 can in general not be omitted.\n7. Nonhomogeneous polynomials\nLet f be a polynomial in n variables over a number field k. Let Hf be the (not\nnecessarily reduced) projectivization in Pnk of the scheme f = 0 in Ank . Let Xf be\nthe scheme-theoretic intersection of Hf with the hyperplane at infinity. Let \u03b4 be the\ndimension of the singular locus of Xf when this singular locus is nonempty, and put\n\u03b4 = \u22121 when Xf is smooth. We say that f satisfies Tameness Condition (7.0.1) if\n(7.0.1)\n\n\u03b4f \u2265 \u03b4 + 1.\n\nNote that by (6.1.2) a homogeneous polynomial of degree \u2265 2 always satisfies\nTameness Condition (7.0.1). Under this Tameness Condition we get the analogue\nof Theorem 6.1:\n7.1. Theorem. - Let f be a polynomial in n variables over a number field k.\nSuppose that f satisfies Tameness Condition (7.0.1). Then there exists a number\n\n\fIGUSA'S CONJECTURE ON EXPONENTIAL SUMS\n\n15\n\nM and a constant c such that for each K \u2208 Ck,M and each y \u2208 K with vK (y) = \u22121\none has\n(7.1.1)\n\n|Ef,K (y)| < c |y|\u03b1f ,\n\nProof. - Same proof as for Theorem 6.1, using \u03b4 + 1 instead of \u03b4f in (6.1.3), which\nholds by the same Theorem 4 of [15].\n7.2. Example. - For f (x1 , x2 ) = x21 x2 \u2212 x1 , one has \u03b1(\u03c0) = \u03b1f = \u2212\u221e, but\nEf,K (y) 6= 0 for any K \u2208 CQ,2 when vK (y) = \u22121. Hence, a literal analogue of\nConjecture 1.1 would not make sense for general polynomials. Note that f does not\nsatisfy Tameness Condition (7.0.1).\n8. Igusa's conjecture revisited\nWe come back to the sums Ef (N) from the introduction and study the growth\nof |Ef (N)| with N. As noted before, it is sufficient to bound |Ef (pm )| in terms of\nprimes p and positive integers m. We focus on m > 1 since the case m = 1 is rather\nwell understood by work by Deligne, Laumon, Katz, and others.\nIn general one has the following situation which follows from [10] or [4]. Let f\nbe any polynomial over Q in n variables. Then there exist constants \u03b2, \u03b3 \u2265 0 such\nthat for all big enough primes p and all m \u2265 \u03b3, one has\n(8.0.1)\n\n|Ef (pm )| < p\u03b2 mn\u22121 p\u03b1f m ,\n\nwith \u03b1f the motivic oscillation index.\nA natural sharpening of Igusa's Conjecture 1.1 is the conjecture that one can\ntake \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 0 in (8.0.1) when f is homogeneous. (Conjecture 1.1 follows from this\nsharpening by (1.2.1) and by Corollary 3.4.) An alternative sharpening of Igusa's\nconjecture by Denef and Sperber in [12] is based on complex oscillation indices and\nmight be equivalent with our sharpening (that is, the supremum of the complex\noscillation indices of f around each of the points of Cn might equal \u03b1f ).\nWe introduce the following mysterious invariant of f which might play a role in\nunderstanding Ef (pm ) for general f :\n8.1. Definition. - Let f be a polynomial in n variables over a number field k.\nDefine \u03b2f as the limit over M and \u03b3 of the infima of all real \u03b2 \u2265 0 such that\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n|Ef,K (y)| < qK\n|vK (y)|n\u22121|y|Kf\n\nfor all y \u2208 K with vK (y) < \u2212\u03b3 and all K \u2208 Ak,M . Call \u03b2f the flaw of f w.r.t. \u03b1f .\nFor non-homogeneous f , \u03b2f is not even conjecturally understood.\nAcknowledgment. - I would like to thank J. Denef, F. Loeser, W. Veys,\nD. Segers, and J. Nicaise for fruitful discussions during the preparation of this\npaper. I am indebted to J.
