We can model such spacetime noncommutativity by the commutation relations\n[b\nx\u03bc , x\nb\u03bd ] = i\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\u03b8\u03bd\u03bc are constants and x\nb\u03bc are the coordinate functions on Rn on which the Poincar\u00e9\ngroup acts in a standard manner for \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd = 0:\n\nx\nb\u03bc (x) = x\u03bc .\n\n(2)\n\nThere are many noncommutative algebras of functions on spacetime with different products\n(\"\u2217-products\") which realize the commutation relations (1). But under suitable conditions, they\nV\nare all \u2217-isomorphic. Two such typical algebras are the Moyal and Wick-Voros planes AM\n\u03b8 and A\u03b8 .\n\nWe recall their \u2217-isomorphism in section 2.\nRelation (1) brings with it another problem: at first sight it seems that the noncommutativity\nof spacetime coordinates violates Poincar\u00e9 invariance. The L.H.S. of (1), in fact, transforms in a\nnon-trivial way under the standard action of the Poincar\u00e9 group whereas the R.H.S. does not. But\nif its action is changed to the sothere is still a way to act with the Poincar\u00e9 group on AM,V\n\u03b8\ncalled twisted action [6, 7, 8]. This modification changes the standard Hopf algebra associated with\nthe Poincar\u00e9 group (the Poincar\u00e9-Hopf algebra HP) to a twisted Poincar\u00e9-Hopf algebra H\u03b8M,V P\n(H0M,V P \u2261 HP).\nV\nIn this paper, we establish that the \u2217-isomorphism T:AM\n\u03b8 \u2192 A\u03b8 , which isomorphically map\n\nH\u03b8M P \u2192 H\u03b8V P, does not extend to an unitary equivalence of the two Fock spaces. Quantum\nfield theories on these planes with twisted Poincar\u00e9-Hopf symmetries are thus not equivalent. We\nexplicitly demonstrate this result by showing that whereas a non-trivial dependence on \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd of a\nself-energy diagram is absent for the Moyal plane in the absence of gauge fields, that is not the case\nfor the Wick-Voros plane.\n\n2\n\n\fOur results differ from those of [4] because of differences in approach to quantum field theories,\n[4] following the treatment in [9].\n\nII.\n\nON TWIST-DEFORMATIONS OF ALGEBRAS\nThe standard algebra A0 \u2261 (F (M), m0 ) of functions on the Minkowski space-time M \u223c\n= R4 is\n\ncommutative with m0 being the point-wise multiplication:\nm0 (f \u2297 g)(x) = f (x)g(x).\n\n(3)\n\nIn order to get relation (1), we need to deform the product m0 into a noncommutative one. This\ncan be done using the so-called twist deformation [10]. Let us call the twist and multiplication map\nmM,V\nand F\u03b8M,V for AM,V\n. Then:\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\nmM,V\n\u2261 m0 \u25e6 F\u03b8M,V\n\u03b8\n\n(4)\n\nHereafter we will call F\u03b8M and F\u03b8V respectively the Moyal and Wick-Voros twists and call the Moyal\nV\nand Wick-Voros algebras AM\n\u03b8 and A\u03b8 .\n\nIn the following, for the sake of simplicity, we will work in 2-dimensions. The generalization to\narbitrary dimensions will be done at the end. In 2-dimensions, we can write \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd as\n\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b8\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(5)\n\n\u01eb01 = \u2212 \u01eb10 = 1\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is a constant. Then the two twists assume the form:\ni\nF\u03b8M = exp \u03b8[\u2202x \u2297 \u2202y \u2212 \u2202y \u2297 \u2202x ]\n2\n1\nM\nV\nF\u03b8 = F\u03b8 exp \u03b8[\u2202x \u2297 \u2202x + \u2202y \u2297 \u2202y ].\n2\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nGiven the above expressions, an explicit form for the noncommutative product of the functions\nin the two cases follows immediately,\ni\n\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2190\n\u2212\n\u03b1 \u2297\u2202 \u03b2\n\n(f \u22c6M g)(x) = m\u03b8 (f \u2297 g)(x) = m0 \u25e6 F\u03b8M (f \u2297 g)(x) \u2261 f (x)e 2 \u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 \u2202\n(f \u22c6V g)(x) = m\u03b8 (f \u2297 g)(x) = m0 \u25e6 F\u03b8V (f \u2297 g)(x) \u2261 f (x)e\n\n3\n\ni\n2\n\n\u201e\n\ng(x)\n\n\u00ab\n\u2192\n\u2190\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2190\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2192\n\u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 \u2202 \u03b1 \u2297\u2202 \u03b2 \u2212i\u03b8 \u2202 \u03b1 \u2297\u2202\u03b1\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\ng(x)\n\n(10)\n\n\fIf we let the \u2217-product to act on the coordinates functions, we get in both the cases the noncommutative relation of (1).\nNot all the invertible maps from A\u03b8 \u2297A\u03b8 onto itself are allowed as twists. Requiring the deformed\nproduct m\u03b8 to be associative, we find a certain set of conditions. The two cases considered above\nfulfill all of them because the differential operators acting on A\u03b8 commute among themselves. It\ncan be shown that this is a sufficient condition for m\u03b8 to be associative, though it is not a necessary\none. In general, the twist has to be a two-cocycle in the Hochschild cohomology, see [11] for further\ndiscussion.\nWe end this section with the mathematical definition of the equivalence of two deformations. It\nproceeds as follows:\nDefinition 1 Two deformations of the algebra of functions A\u03b8 \u2261 (F (M), m\u03b8 ) and A\u2032\u03b8 \u2261\n(F (M), m\u2032\u03b8 ) are equivalent if there exists an invertible map T from A\u03b8 \u2192 A\u2032\u03b8 which is compatible\nwith the product in A\u2032\u03b8 , that is:\nT(f \u2217 g) = T(f ) \u2217\u2032 T(g)\n\n\u2200f, g \u2208 F (M),\n\n(11)\n\nHere \u2217 and \u2217\u2032 are products induced by m\u03b8 and m\u2032\u03b8 .\nWriting (11) in terms of the twist, we get the following condition:\nm0 \u25e6 F\u03b8 = T\u22121 \u25e6 m0 \u25e6 F\u03b8\u2032 \u25e6 (T \u2297 T) .\n\n(12)\n\nFor the two deformations described above (namely Moyal and Wick-Voros), such a map T can\nbe found [12, 13, 14] explicitly: We have\nT:\n\nAM\n\u03b8\n\n\u2192\n\nAV\u03b8\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b8\nT = exp \u2212 \u22072\n4\n\n,\n\n\u0013\n\n(13)\n\nAs a final remark of this section, we want to observe that this map T cannot be seen as a\nrealization of an element of a group since it involves the Laplacian, and that is not an element of\nits Lie algebra.\nV\nBoth AM\n\u03b8 and A\u03b8 are \u2217-algebras with * being complex conjugation of functions. It is easy to\n\nsee that T is compatible with this * so that the algebras are \u2217-isomporphic.\n\n4\n\n\fIII.\n\nTHE HOPF STRUCTURE ON SYMMETRY ALGEBRAS\n\nThe next step is the specification of the Hopf algebra structure of a group G acting on the\nalgebra of functions (see [15, 16, 17] for Hopf algebras). This structure can be determined from\nconsidering the action of G upon the tensor product of functions. This latter is given by the socalled co-product indicated by \u2206. Let CG be the group algebra of G . Then \u2206 is a homomorphism\nfrom CG to CG \u2297 CG :\n\u2206 : CG \u2192 CG \u2297 CG\n\n\u2200g \u2208 G , f, h \u2208 A [g] \u22b2 (f \u2297 h) = (\u03c1 \u2297 \u03c1)(\u2206(g)) \u25e6 (f \u2297 h)\n\n(14)\n\nHere \u03c1 is the representation of CG on A and \u22b2 indicates the action of the group on functions.\nThe explicit form of \u2206 is given by asking CG to be an automorphism of the algebra, that is the\naction of the group has to be compatible with the multiplication rule on A:\n[g] \u22b2 m(f \u2297 h)(x) = m([g] \u22b2 (f \u2297 h))(x)\n\n(15)\n\nIt is easy to see that in the commutative case A0 , on group-like elements, the co-product assumes\nthe trivial form:\n\u22060 (g) = g \u2297 g\n\n(16)\n\nThis co-product can be extended to CG by linearity.\nThe co-product above is not compatible [6, 7, 8] with the action of G on the deformed algebra\nA\u03b8 . For the twist deformations of the algebra of functions AM,V\nconsidered in (4), there is a\n\u03b8\nsimple \"recipe\" to get deformations \u2206M,V\nof \u22060 compatible with m\u03b8 :\n\u03b8\n\u2206M,V\n= (F\u03b8M,V )\u22121 \u22060 F\u03b8M,V\n\u03b8\n\n(17)\n\n. For the two different twists\nwhere F\u03b8M,V are the realizations of the twist elements F\u03b8M,V on AM,V\n\u03b8\nconsidered above, namely Moyal and Wick-Voros ones, we will get two different deformations of\nthe group algebra CG . Without going deeper into the deformation theory of Hopf algebras, we just\nnote that the deformations we are considering here are very specific ones since we leave invariant\nthe multiplication rule of CG deforming only the co-structures of the underlying Hopf algebra (in\nour case we only change \u22060 \u2192 \u2206M,V\nleaving the group multiplication the same).\n\u03b8\nWe can now state when two Hopf algebra deformations of the above type are said to be equivalent\n[16]:\n\n5\n\n\fDefinition 2 Two twist deformations F\u03b8 and F\u03b8\u2032 are equivalent iff there exists an invertible element\n\u03b3 \u2208 CG such that1\nF\u03b8 = \u03b3 \u2297 \u03b3F\u03b8\u2032 \u22060 (\u03b3 \u22121 )\n\n(18)\n\n,\n\nwhich for group-like element reduces to\nF\u03b8 = \u03b3 \u2297 \u03b3F\u03b8\u2032 \u03b3 \u22121 \u2297 \u03b3 \u22121\n\n.\n\n(19)\n\nNote that in terms of co-products,\n\u2206\u03b8 (g) = \u03b3 \u2297 \u03b3\u2206\u2032\u03b8 (\u03b3 \u22121 g\u03b3)\u03b3 \u22121 \u2297 \u03b3 \u22121\n\n(20)\n\nwhich is precisely the condition for the equivalence of the two Hopf algebras H\u03b8 G = (CG , m, \u2206\u03b8 )\nand H\u03b8 G \u2032 = (CG , m, \u2206\u2032\u03b8 ) [16]\nThis last equivalence condition is valid even if the co-products do not arise from Drinfiel'd's\ntwists of \u22060 = \u2206\u20320\n\nIV.\n\nCLASSICAL EQUIVALENCE OF DEFORMED ALGEBRAS WITH SYMME-\n\nTRIES\nWe can now state the conditions for a (limited) physical equivalence of two deformed algebras\nwith their associated symmetries. We need not assume that the deformed co-products below arise\nfrom Drinfel'd's twists:\nDefinition 3 Two deformations, A\u03b8 and A\u2032\u03b8 , of the algebra of functions, A0 = A\u20320 , which carry\nthe action of the deformed Hopf algebras H\u03b8 , H\u03b8\u2032 (H0 = H0\u2032 ) are classically equivalent2 if there\nexists an isomorphism map T between the two algebras such that the following condition is fulfilled:\n\u2200g \u2208 H\u03b8 , \u2200f, h \u2208 A\u03b8\n1\n\n2\n\n:\n\nT \u2297 T (\u2206\u03b8 (g) \u22b2 f \u2297 h) = \u2206\u2032\u03b8 (gT ) \u22b2 (T(f ) \u2297 T(h)) .\n\n(21)\n\nThe condition that follows can be given a cohomological interpretation, namely that the two twists have\nto be in the same equivalence class. For further details see [16].\nThe reason why we call it classical is because at this level we only deal with functions, that is classical\nfields. We did not however prove that the actual classical dynamics arising from the two deformations are\nthe same. We hope to discuss this issue elsewhere in more detail in [18].\n\n6\n\n\fHere g \u2208 H\u03b8 and T : g \u2192 gT is an isomorphism on CG . It can be written in a diagrammatic form\nusing the following commutative diagram:\nT\u2297T\n\nA\u03b8 \u2297 A\u03b8 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 A\u2032\u03b8 \u2297 A\u2032\u03b8\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u2206\u2032 (g )\n\uf8e6\u2206 (g)\ny \u03b8 T\ny \u03b8\n\n(22)\n\nT\u2297T\n\nA\u03b8 \u2297 A\u03b8 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 A\u2032\u03b8 \u2297 A\u2032\u03b8\nHere g \u2208 H\u03b8 .\n\nIn the case of the Drinfel'd twists discussed above, T = \u03b3 and gT = \u03b3 \u22121 g\u03b3.\nThe necessity for the characterization of the above equivalence condition as classical merits\nillustration by an example where two classically equivalent deformations, and even that with qualification, lead to differing physics. We now give such an example.\n\nV.\n\nINEQUIVALENCE OF MOYAL AND WICK-VOROS QFT'S\nWe first show that at the classical level AM,V\nare equivalent when Poincar\u00e9 invariance is imple\u03b8\n\nmented by twisting the co-products by F\u03b8M,V . This result follows from direct computation of (18)\nsince3\n\u22060 (T\n\n\u22121\n\n) = exp\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n2\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u03bc\n\u22060 (\u2207 ) = T \u2297 T exp\n2\u2202\u03bc \u2297 \u2202\n4\n4\n\nfor T as in (13). Since [\u22072 , \u2202\u03bc ] = 0 then in the case of Moyal and Wick-Voros:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b8\n\u22121\nM\nM\n\u03bc\n(T \u2297 T)F\u03b8 \u22060 (T ) = F\u03b8 exp \u2212 2\u2202\u03bc \u2297 \u2202\n= F\u03b8V\n4\n\n(23)\n\n(24)\n\nTo proceed further, let us first show that the R matrices in the case of Moyal and Wick-Voros\nplanes are exactly the same. Hence the twisted statistics operators are equal for the Moyal and\nWick-Voros planes. The proof is as follows. Recalling (7-8), the two twists can be written as:\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni \u03bc\nM\n\u03bd\nF\u03b8 = exp\n\u2202 \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd \u2297 \u2202\n(25)\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b8\nF\u03b8V = F\u03b8M exp\n\u2202\u03bc \u2297 \u2202 \u03bc \u2261 F\u03b8M S\u03b8V .\n(26)\n2\n3\n\nIt is possible to prove, using a non-trivial construction, that the above equivalence is directly implied since\nthe two spacetime algebras are isomorphic with the isomorphism T\u2208 H. See [18] for a discussion.\n\n7\n\n\fA simple argument [19] then shows that the twisted flip operators defining statistics are:\n\u03c4\u03b8M,V = (F\u03b8M,V )\u22121 \u03c40 F\u03b8M,V\n\n(27)\n\nIt is then easy to show that the symmetric exponential S\u03b8V multiplying F\u03b8M in (26) which\ndifferentiates Moyal from Wick-Voros disappears from the \u03c4\u03b8M,V . Hence \u03c4\u03b8M = \u03c4\u03b8V .\nIt follows then that the creation and annihilation operators in the two cases are twisted (essentially) in the same way4 . If \u03b1p , \u03b1\u2020p and cp , c\u2020p are the \"dressed\" and \"undressed\" annihilation and\ncreation operators in the Voros case, then5\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b1p = cp exp\np\u03bc \u03b8 P\u03bd\n2\n\n\u0013\ni\n\u03bc\u03bd\n= exp \u2212 p\u03bc \u03b8 P\u03bd c\u2020p\n2\n\n(28)\n\nwhere P\u03bc is the total four-momentum operator. For a free field of mass m, it is\nZ\np\ndp\nP\u03bd = d\u03bcp p\u03bd \u03b1\u2020p \u03b1p ,\nd\u03bcp =\n, |p0 | = p2 + m2 .\n2|p0 |\n\n(29)\n\nand\n\n\u03b1\u2020p\n\n\u0012\n\nWe now explicitly check that the \u03b8 dependence in the Wick-Voros case produces non-trivial\n\neffects in quantum field theory even when there are no gauge fields.\nLet us first consider the Moyal case. The twisted free field \u03c6M\n\u03b8 of mass m has the mode expansion\n[20]\n\u03c6\u03b8 (x) =\n\nZ\n\nh\ni\nd\u03bcp ap ep (x) + a\u2020p e\u2212p (x)\n\n(30)\n\nwhere ap , a\u2020p are (upto equivalence [20]) \u03b1p , \u03b1\u2020p and where ep (x) \u2261 eip*x . These fields at the same\nx must be multiplied with the Moyal \u2217 product \u2217M . As a consequence [21]\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2212 \u03b1\u03b2\ni\u2190\nM\nM\nM\n\u03c6\u03b8 \u2217M \u03c6\u03b8 \u2217M ... \u2217M \u03c6\u03b8 = (\u03c60 \u03c60 * * * \u03c60 ) exp\n\u2202\u03b1 \u03b8 P\u03b2 ,\n\u03c60 = \u03c6M\n0\n2\n\n.\n\n(31)\n\nUsing this identity, it has been proved elsewhere [1, 2, 3] that in the Moyal case the S-matrix\nS\u03b8M in the absence of gauge fields is independent of \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd .\nBut this identity fails in the Wick-Voros case because of the extra twist S\u03b8V in (26). One finds\nfor a Wick-Voros field \u03c6V\u03b8 of mass m,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2212 \u03b1\u03b2\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212 \u03b1\u03b2\ni\u2190\n\u03b8\u2190\ni\u2190\nV\nV\nV\n\u03c6\u03b8 \u2217V \u03c6\u03b8 = m0 (\u03c60 S\u03b8 \u03c60 ) exp\n\u2202\u03b1 \u03b8 P\u03b2 = \u03c60 exp\n\u2202 * \u2202 \u03c60 exp\n\u2202\u03b1 \u03b8 P\u03b2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(32)\n\n\u03c60 \u2261 \u03c6V0\n\n4\n5\n\nThis remark merits further considerations.

Here instead that is not\nthe case. To see this, we note that\nZ\nY \u03b8\nd2 x \u03c6V\u03b8 \u2217V * * * \u03c6V\u03b8 = \u03b42 (p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 )\u03c6\u03030 (p1 ) * * * \u03c6\u03030 (p4 )\ne 2 pa pb\n\n(34)\n\na<b\n\nwhere\n\n\u03c60 (x) =\n\nZ\n\nd2 k\u03c6\u03030 (k)eik*x\n\nHence the last factor in (32) becomes 1 and the matrix element hp|i\nthe typical term\n2\n\nconstant \u00d7 \u03b4 (p \u2212 q)\n\nZ\n\n(35)\nR\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\nd2 x \u03c6V\u03b8 \u2217V * * * \u03c6V\u03b8 |qi has\n\n\"\n\u0013#\n\u0012\nY\nd2 k\n1\n\u03b8\np~a * p~b\nexp\n(2\u03c0)2 k2 + m2\n2\n\n(36)\n\na<b\n\nwhere one pa is p, another is \u2212q and the remaining pc 's are k. So we can see that the terms which\nmix the external momenta with the internal one cancel each other since they occur in an even\nnumber of terms with alternate signs.\nFinally we see that this diagram is proportional to\nZ\n\u03b8 2\nZ \u221e\n2\n\u03b8 2\nd\u03b1 e\u2212\u03b1m\nd2 k e\u2212 2 k\n\u2212 \u03b82 p2\n=\ne\n\u03b42 (p \u2212 q)\u03a0(1) = e\u2212 2 p\n(2\u03c0)2 k2 + m2\n(4\u03c0) \u03b82 + \u03b1\n0\n\n9\n\n(37)\n\n\fwhere \u03a0(1) has been evaluated using the Schwinger parametrization and is finite, since the \"infrared\"\ndivergence has been removed by \u03b8:\n\u03b8\n\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b4 (p \u2212 q)\u03a0\n\n2\n\ne 2 (m \u2212p\n=\n4\u03c0\n\n2)\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u03b8\n2\n\n2\u03b2\n\ne\u2212m\nd\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\n(38)\n\nwhich gets its usual divergent behaviour in the limit \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 0 [23, 24].\nEquation (37) shows a dependence on the sign of the symmetric part S\u03b8V since a minus sign in\n(26) will make the diagram even more divergent in Euclidean space than in the standard commutative theory. An explanation of that can perhaps be found in the fact that the Wick-Voros product\nis obtained from the noncommutative algebra of operators by taking the expectation value in coherent states. The sign in (26) is obtained using the normal ordering of operators. The opposite\nchoice, namely the anti-normal ordering, instead gives rise to the minus sign. The divergence of\nthe diagram may then traced to the lack of proper definition of the latter6 .\n\nVI.\n\nFINAL REMARKS\n\nWe can now briefly outline how to generalize our considerations on the Wick-Voros twist (8)\nto 2N -dimensions7 . We can always choose x\u0302\u03bc so that \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd , now a 2N \u00d7 2N antisymmetric matrix,\nbecomes a direct sum of N 2 \u00d7 2 ones. By antisymmetry, these 2 \u00d7 2 matrices are of the form (5)\nbut different 2\u00d72 matrices may have different \u03b8's. For every such 2 \u00d7 2 block, we have a pair of x\u0302's\nwhich can be treated as in the 2-dimensional case above. (Of course there is no twist in any block\nwith a vanishing \u03b8.)\nIn conclusion when two algebras A and A\u2032 and its Hopf symmetries are both twisted, the\nequivalence at the level of classical fields using the two deformed structures requires the equivalence\nof both the twisted algebras and their Hopf symmetries in a precise sense. We have derived\nthis condition. We have then shown that going to quantum theory, as often happens, introduces\nmore complication. We have proven that, although the classical fields on Moyal and Wick-Voros\nplanes satisfy the condition of equivalence given in the paper, their quantum field theories are\n6\n7\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge Giuseppe Marmo for having pointed this out.\nIn 2N + 1-dimensions, we can always choose 2N + 1 so that \u03b8\u03bc,2N +1 =\u03b82N +1,\u03bc =0)\n\n10\n\n\fnot equivalent. We have also explicitly shown this inequivalence by calculating a simple Feynman\ndiagram.\n\nVII.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge discussions with Fedele Lizzi, Alexander Pinzul, Amilcar R.
