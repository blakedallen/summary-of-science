Pesch7\nobtained a compact analytic solution to them based on\nthe lowest Landau-level approximation for the pair potential. It has been used recently to discuss the field\ndependences of the thermal conductivity,8 the density\nof states,9,10,11 and thermodynamic quantities.12 On the\nother hand, Klein13,14 obtained a full numerical solution\nfor the vortex-lattice state using a standard procedure\nto solve ordinary differential equations. This numerical approach has been used extensively by Ichioka et\nal.15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23 to clarify the field dependences\nof the pair potential and the density of states for type-II\nsuperconductors with various energy-gap structures. It\nshould be noted, however, that those numerical studies\nall adopted simplified model Fermi surfaces instead of\ncomplicated Fermi surfaces for real materials. Indeed,\nrecent theoretical studies10,24,25,26 have clarified that detailed Fermi-surface structures are indispensable for the\nquantitative description of the vortex state.\nWith these backgrounds, we here develop an alternative method to solve the Eilenberger equations for the\nvortex-lattice states. A key point lies in expanding the\npair potential and the quasiclassical f function in the basis functions of the vortex-lattice states, thereby transforming the differential equations into algebraic equations. This method has been powerful for (i) solving\nthe Ginzburg-Landau equations27 and the Bogoliubovde Gennes equations28,29,30,31 and (ii) obtaining quantitative agreements on the upper critical field Hc2 of\nNb, NbSe2 , and MgB2 with Fermi surfaces from firstprinciples electronic-structure calculations.25,26 Thus,\n\nthe method may be more advantageous for the calculations of thermodynamic quantities in finite magnetic fields when realistic Fermi surfaces are used as inputs. It will also be convenient for microscopically calculating responses of the vortex-lattice state to external\nperturbations,32 such as vortex-lattice oscillations.\nThis method is applied here to calculate magnetic-field\ndependences of the magnetization, the entropy, the Pauli\nparamagnetism, and the pair potential at various temperatures for the two-dimensional s- and dx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductors in the clean and dirty limits. These quantities\nhave been obtained near Hc2 for the s-wave pairing.33,34\nOur purpose here is to clarify the overall field dependence\nof those quantities.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section II gives the\nformulation. Section III presents numerical results. Section IV summarizes the paper.

(7), the coupled equation (9) may be solved iteratively in order of Eqs. (9a),\n(9b), and (9c) by adopting a standard technique to solve\nnonlinear equations.40\npA convenient starting point is to\n(0)\nput \u2206N = \u03b4N 0 \u2206(T ) 1\u2212B/Hc2, fN = 0, and \u00c3K = 0\non the right-hand of Eq. (9a), where \u2206(T ) is the angleaveraged energy gap in zero field. In this connection, it\nmay be worth noting that the tridiagonal matrix constructed from the coefficients of fN on the left-hand side\nof Eq. (9a) can be inverted analytically.25 The Fermisurface integrals h* * * i can be performed as described in\nSec. IV of Ref. 25. In contrast, integrations over r in\nEqs. (9a) and (9c) may be carried out as follows: At the\nbeginning of each calculation, we prepare \u03c8N q (r) and\neiK*r at equally spaced Nint \u00d7 Nint discrete points in a\nunit cell. We then construct \u2206(r), f (\u03b5n , kF , r), \u00c3(r),\n\nand g = (1\u2212f f \u2020 )1/2 on those points by Eqs. (8) with restricting the summations to those satisfying N \u2264 Nc and\n|K| \u2264 Kc , where Nc and Kc are some cutoffs. Now, the\nintegrations can be performed by the trapezoidal rule; its\nconvergence is excellent for periodic functions. Also, the\nsummation over n in Eq. (9b) is restricted in the actual\ncalculations to those satisfying |\u03b5n | \u2264 \u03b5c . The convergence can be checked by increasing Nint , Nc , Kc , and\n\u03b5c . Finally, the vortex-lattice structure can be fixed by\nrequiring that the free energy (3) be minimum.\n\nE.\n\nThermodynamic quantities\n\nOnce \u2206, f , and \u00c3 are determined as above, we can\ncalculate thermodynamic quantities of the vortex-lattice\nstate.

(15) corresponds\nto \u03ba = 49 and 40 for the s- and dx2 \u2212y2 -wave pairings\nin the clean limit, respectively, and \u03ba = 1300 for the swave pairing with \u03c4 = 0.01~/\u2206(0). The vortex-lattice\nstructure has been fixed as hexagonal (square) for the\ns-wave (dx2 \u2212y2 -wave) pairing so that finite contributions\nin the expansion (8a) come only from N = 0, 6, 12, * * *\n(N = 0, 4, 8, * * * ) Landau levels.\nEquation (9) for the above model has been solved with\nthe procedure of Sec. IID over 0.05Hc2 \u2264 B \u2264 Hc2 . The\nvalue Ncut is chosen as 30 (16) for the s-wave (dx2 \u2212y2 wave) pairing. On the other hand, we have set \u03b5c =\n20Tc (50Tc) at T = 0.9Tc (0.3Tc ). These values have\nbeen enough to get the convergence. Using \u2206, f , and\n\u00c3 thus obtained, we have calculated the magnetization\nby supercurrent, the entropy, and the magnetization by\nPauli Paramagnetism by Eqs. (11a), (11b), and (11c),\nrespectively.\nFigure 1 presents magnetic-field dependence of the\nmagnetization by supercurrent for the s- and dx2 \u2212y2 -wave\npairings in the clean limit at several temperatures. In\nboth cases, the initial slope at B = Hc2 gradually decreases as the temperature is lowered, implying a monotonic increase of the Maki parameter41 \u03ba2 (T ) as T \u2192 0.\nThis feature of \u03ba2 (T ) has also been predicted in the case\nof the three-dimensional spherical Fermi surface with\nthe s-wave pairing.33,41,42,43 Unlike the three dimensional\ncase,33,42,43 however, the slope in these two-dimensional\ncases remains finite and does not approach 0 even in the\nclean limit of T \u2192 0, in agreement with a previous calculation of \u03ba2 .33 The curves at low temperatures become\nmore and more concave upward, thereby compensating\nthe initial reduction of the magnetization. The temperature variation is slightly larger for the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave pairing than the s-wave pairing.\nFigure 2 shows the expansion coefficients \u2206N in Eq.\n(8a) as a function of B/Hc2 for the s- and dx2 \u2212y2 wave pairings in the clean limit at T = 0.3Tc .

Our estimates for \u03b1S (T \u2192 0) and \u03b1\u03c7 (T \u2192 0) are somewhat smaller\n(larger) for the s-wave (dx2 \u2212y2 -wave) pairing.\nExperiments on the T -linear specific-heat coefficient \u03b3s (B) have been performed for clean V3 Si,44\nNbSe2 ,45,46,47,48 and CeRu2 .49 The quantity \u03b3s (B)/\u03b3n\ncoincides for T \u2192 0 with (Ss \u2212 Ss0 )/(Sn \u2212 Ss0 ) of Fig.\n3. Those data all show marked upward deviations from\nthe linear behavior \u03b3n B/Hc2 , indicating that it is a common feature among clean superconductors irrespective of\nthe energy-gap symmetry. Sonier et al.47 thereby extracted the exponent 0.66 for the field dependence of\n\u03b3s (B) as T \u2192 0, in good agreement with the result 0.67\nby Ichioka et al.17 for the clean two-dimensional s-wave\nmodel. However, a more recent experiment by Hanaguri\net al.48 reported a different exponent 0.5. It should also\nbe noted that NbSe2 has three kinds of Fermi surfaces\nand one of them is quite different in structure from the\ncylinder. There also exists a recent experiment which\nindicates existence of different superconducting energy\n\ngaps on different Fermi surfaces.3 Hence the agreement\nbetween the experiment by Sonier et al.47 and the theory by Ichioka et al.17 might be an artifact and should be\nconfirmed by more detailed experiments as well as theories incorporating both Fermi-surface and gap structures.\nIn this context, it is worth noting that no detailed experiments have been performed on the field dependence of\n\u03b3s (B) even for the classic type-II superconductors V and\nNb, although early experiments50,51 suggest similar upward deviations from the linear behavior \u03b3n B/Hc2 .\nWe next focus on the s-wave pairing in the dirty limit.\nFigure 5 shows the magnetization for \u03c4 = 0.01~/\u2206(0) as\na function of B/Hc2 . Compared with the clean-limit results of Fig. 1(a), we observe an extended linearity down\nto B/Hc2 \u223c 0.2 irrespective of the temperature.

Hayden, and J. W. Brill, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 117003\n\nUsing it, we have calculated the field dependences of\nthe magnetization by supercurrent, the mixing of higher\nLandau levels in the pair potential, the entropy, and\nthe Pauli paramagnetism for the two-dimensional s- and\ndx2 \u2212y2 -wave pairings in the clean and dirty limits at various temperatures. Previous results near Hc2 for the swave pairing33,34 have been reproduced adequately and\nextended to lower fields to clarify the overall field dependences. The differences between the s- and dx2 \u2212y2 -wave\npairings are quite small at high temperatures but develop gradually as the temperature is lowered, reflecting\nthe marked difference in the low-energy density of states\nbetween the two cases. The field dependences of the entropy and Pauli paramagnetism in the clean limit at low\ntemperatures present convex-upward behaviors for both\npairings. In contrast, the curves of the s-wave pairing in\nthe dirty limit are more monotonic and fairly close to the\nlinear behavior, but also acquire downward curvature at\nlow temperatures. As for the magnetization by supercurrent, there is a wide region of linear field dependence\nfrom Hc2 both at high temperatures and in the dirty\nlimit. The region shrinks in the clean limit as the temperature is lowered, and the curve acquires pronounced\nupward curvature. It is also found that the mixing of\nhigher Landau levels in the pair potential is small for\nB & 0.1Hc2 but develops rapidly as the field is further\ndecreased.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work is supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture,\nSports, Science, and Technology of Japan, and also from\nthe 21st century COE program \"Topological Science and\nTechnology,\" Hokkaido University.\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n7\n\n(2003).\nH.
