Consider for N \u2208 N\nrandom processes of the form\nHN := (HN (\u03c3), \u03c3 \u2208 {\u22121, +1}N ) ,\n\u2217\n\nL.-P. Arguin held a postdoctoral position at Courant Institute during this work. He was supported by\nthe NSF grant DMS-0604869 and partially by the Hausdorff Center for Mathematics, Bonn.\n\u2020\nSourav Chatterjee's research was partially supported by NSF grants DMS-0707054 and DMS-1005312,\nand a Sloan Research Fellowship\n\n1\n\n\fwhere HN (\u03c3) is a centered Gaussian variable. Denote the law of HN by P and the corresponding expectation by E. Suppose that the covariances between variables are of the\nform\nE HN (\u03c3)HN (\u03c3 \u2032 ) = Nr(\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 )\nfor some positive definite symmetric form r on {\u22121, +1}N with r(\u03c3, \u03c3) = 1 for all \u03c3. We\nsay that HN is the Hamiltonian of a Gaussian spin glass. An important example is the\nSherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model for which\n\u2032\n\nr(\u03c3, \u03c3 ) =\n\nN\n1 X\n\u03c3i \u03c3i\u2032\nN i=1\n\n!2\n\n.\n\nThe definition also includes the Edwards-Anderson (EA) model. This model can be defined\nfor example in a box of Zd with N vertices and edge set EN . The form for the EA model is\nthen\nX\n1\n\u03c3i \u03c3j \u03c3i\u2032 \u03c3j\u2032 .\nr(\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 ) =\n|EN |\n{i,j}\u2208EN\n\nThe Gibbs measure corresponding to the Hamiltonian HN at inverse temperature \u03b2 is defined\nby\nexp \u03b2HN (\u03c3)\n(1.1)\nG\u03b2,N (\u03c3) =\nZN (\u03b2)\nP\nwhere ZN (\u03b2) = \u03c3 exp \u03b2HN (\u03c3). A fundamental problem in the theory of spin glasses is to\ndescribe the limits of G\u03b2,N as N tends to infinity. This information is useful in particular\nto understand the extreme value statistics of the Gaussian process HN . In the past ten\nyears, the rigorous study of spin glasses has made important progresses in the understanding\nof the models in the limit N \u2192 \u221e. One of the major achievements was the proof of\nthe Parisi formula by Guerra and Talagrand [15, 30] for the limiting free energy (that is,\nlimN \u2192\u221e N1 E log ZN (\u03b2)) of the SK model. The formula suggests that the limiting Gibbs\nmeasure G\u03b2 of the SK model (in a suitable sense) has a support that is hierarchical or\nultrametric, that is with P -probability one\nn\no\nG\u03b2\u22973 (\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 , \u03c3 \u2032\u2032 ) : r(\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 ) \u2265 min {r(\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032\u2032 ), r(\u03c3 \u2032 , \u03c3 \u2032\u2032 )} = 1 .\n\nIn fact, it is expected that the ultrametricity of the Gibbs measure is universal to a certain\nextent within spin glasses. This hypothesis is at the core of the description of spin glasses\ndeveloped by physicists, and often referred to as Parisi theory [19]. In spite of important\nadvances in the understanding of the structure of the Gibbs measure [23, 5], the problem of\nrigorously characterizing the limiting Gibbs measures of spin glasses remains open.\nThis paper takes the approach introduced by Aizenman, Sims and Starr [3] and extended\nin [7] to study the limiting Gibbs measures of spin glasses. The idea goes as follows. Given\nan infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space H with inner product \"*\", there exists an\nembedding of the hypercube {\u22121, 1}N in H that preserves the form r, that is, if \u03c3 7\u2192 v(\u03c3) \u2208\nH then\nr(\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 ) = v(\u03c3) * v(\u03c3 \u2032 ) .\n2\n\n\fFor example, for the SK model with N sites, the Hilbert space H can be taken to be the L2\nspace of some abstract probability space (\u03a9, F , P), and the map v defined as\nv(\u03c3) =\n\nN\n1 X\ngij \u03c3i \u03c3j ,\nN i,j=1\n\nwhere gij : \u03a9 \u2192 R are independent standard Gaussian random variables under P.\nUnder such an embedding, the Gibbs measure is naturally sent to the random probability\nmeasure on H assigning weight G\u03b2,N (\u03c3) to the corresponding vector v(\u03c3). Of course, there\nis more than one such isometric embedding. Since the products v * v \u2032 determine the vectors\nup to a choice of basis for H, it is necessary to identify the probability measures on H that\ndiffer by an isometry for the image measure of G\u03b2,N to be well-defined. It turns out that the\nproper way to study such measures is through the notion of a Random Overlap Structure\nor ROSt. A ROSt is a N \u00d7 N random covariance matrix whose law is invariant under\nsimultaneous finite permutations of rows and columns. In the spin glass setting, the ROSt is\nthe matrix Q\u03b2,N = {r(\u03c3 k , \u03c3 l )}k,l\u2208N where (\u03c3 k , k \u2208 N) are sampled independently from G\u03b2,N .\nThe space of ROSt's is compact in the appropriate topology and it is in correspondence, up\nto isometry, with the space of random probability measures on H (see Section 1.1). Thus\none way to study the limiting Gibbs measures of spin glasses is to describe the limit points\nof the sequence (Q\u03b2,N ) in the space of ROSt's. (Another promising approach is through the\nGhirlanda-Guerra (GG) identities [16, 23, 31]. Although the GG identity approach is not\nthe focus of this article, it seems to be closely connected to the ROSt approach at some\nlevel.)\nThe main result of this paper is to establish that the limiting Gibbs measures (in the\nROSt sense) of any Gaussian spin glass as defined above is stochastically stable. What this\nmeans is that the ROSt's for Gaussian spin glasses are distributionally invariant under a\nbuilt-in stochastic mapping that we call the cavity mapping. (The mapping is well-known,\nbut the nomenclature is ours. Precise definition is given below.) The transformation derives\nits name and structure from the cavity method introduced in [20] (see also [11] for the\ndefinition of the mapping for Ruelle Probability Cascades). It has the features of a basic\nstochastic object akin to the mappings studied by Kahane in the context of multiplicative\nchaos [18]. Similar mappings have been considered earlier in the setting of competing particle\nsystems (see e.g. [28, 5]).\nIt was suggested by the work of several authors that the Gibbs measures of spin glasses\nmust be stochastically stable [2, 3, 28, 5]. Such a statement, however, can be made precise only in the infinite-dimensional setting. One missing ingredient to make the assertion\nrigorous at the level of ROSt's was a proof of the continuity of the cavity mapping. This\nis done in Theorem 1.4. Combining this with some further ingredients, it follows that the\nlimiting Gibbs measure of a Gaussian spin glass is stochastically stable at any \u03b2 where the\nfree energy is differentiable (by convexity, this holds for almost all \u03b2).\nThe characterization of stochastically stable ROSt's is a challenging problem. In view of\nthe main result of this paper, it is also a rewarding one since it provides a way to establish\nuniversal properties of the Gibbs measures of spin glasses, in particular the alleged ultrametricity. We formulate below a precise conjecture, which may be called the Ultrametricity\nConjecture for ROSt's: a ROSt that is stochastically stable (in a strong sense to be defined)\n3\n\n\fmust have ultrametric support. Some partial results towards the resolution of this conjecture\nare given in Section 4. The most important one might be Theorem 1.7 which states that the\nsupport of a stochastically stable ROSt is either one vector or lies in an infinite-dimensional\nsubspace almost surely.\nThe framework of ROSt's has other interesting consequences for spin glasses. In particular, assuming that the ultrametricity conjecture for ROSt's is true, we give a constructive\nproof of the Parisi formula for the free energy of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. This\nmakes rigorous the approach suggested by Aizenman, Sims and Starr [3] to prove the Parisi\nformula.\nWe remark that results similar to ours have been proved in parallel by Panchenko [26].\nThe work focuses on mean-field spin glass models where the law of the Hamiltonian is\ninvariant under permutation of spins, such as the SK model. In this case, a representation\ntheorem for exchangeable arrays (the Aldous-Hoover theorem) can be used. In the ROSt\nsetting, we appeal to the Dovbysh-Sudakov theorem (Theorem 1.2 below). A continuity\nresult is proved and a representation for the Parisi formula, similar to the one obtained here\nfor ROSt's, is found\nThe paper is organized as follows. The framework of ROSt's as well as the precise\nstatements of the main results are given in Section 1.1. The applications of the framework\nto spin glasses are presented in Section 1.2. The continuity of the cavity mapping is proved in\nSection 2. Section 3 derives the Parisi formula from the Ultrametricity Conjecture. Finally,\nsome interesting properties of stochastically stable ROSt's are proved in Section 4.\nAcknowledgments. We thank the referee for insightful remarks and observations that\nled to major improvements of the first version of this paper.\n\n1.1\n\nRandom Overlap Structures and Probability Measures on Hilbert\nSpaces\n\nThis section begins with the definition of random overlap structures using exchangeable\ncovariance matrices. The definition is then explained in terms of probability measures on\nHilbert spaces using the representation theorem of Dovbysh and Sudakov [14]. This setup\nwas previously described in [7]. The section ends with the definition of the cavity mapping\nand the statement of several related results.\nConsider the space of positive semi-definite symmetric N \u00d7 N matrices, or covariance\nmatrices, with 1 on the diagonal. This is a compact separable metric space when considered\nas a closed subset of [\u22121, 1]N\u00d7N equipped with the product topology. The Borel probability\nmeasures on this space form also a compact, separable and metric space when equipped with\nthe weak-\u2217 topology generated by the continuous functions on the entries. An element P of\nthis space is the law of some random covariance matrix Q = {qij }. The continuous functionals\nin the topology considered can be approximated by linear combinations of monomials of the\nform\nY k\nP 7\u2192 E\nqijij ,\n(1.2)\n1\u2264i<j\u2264s\n\nfor s \u2208 N and a collection kij \u2208 N. A random covariance matrix Q is said to be weakly\n\n4\n\n\fexchangeable if for any permutation matrix \u03c4 that fixes all but a finite number of elements\nlaw\n\u03c4 Q \u03c4 \u22121 = Q ,\nlaw\nwhere = denotes equality in law. Since this symmetry is preserved under convergence\ndefined by the functions (1.2), the space of distributions of weakly exchangeable random\ncovariance matrices with 1 on the diagonal is a compact convex set. Throughout the paper,\nwe refer to this subset of laws as the space of ROSt's.\nDefinition 1.1. A random overlap structure, or ROSt, is a weakly exchangeable N \u00d7 N\nrandom covariance matrix with 1 on the diagonal. The law of a ROSt will be usually denoted\nby P and integration with respect to P by E.\nSince the law of a ROSt is determined by the countable set of functions of the form (1.2),\nit is convenient to see these as the coordinates of the ROSt.\nThe relation between ROSt's and probability measures on Hilbert spaces is provided by\nthe representation theorem of Dovbysh and Sudakov [14] (see [25] for a readable proof of this\nresult). Let B be the unit ball of an infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space H (fixed\nthroughout this paper). The inner product on H will be denoted by * and a generic element\nof B by v. The set of Borel probability measures on B is denoted by M(B). Note that M(B)\nis the same whether B is equipped with the weak topology or the norm topology. From any\nelement of M(B), one can construct a ROSt by taking iid vectors sampled from this element\nand considering the Gram matrix of these vectors. The Dovbysh-Sudakov theorem states\nthat any weakly exchangeable random covariance matrix can be constructed this way if one\nconsiders random elements of M(B). In the case where the diagonal entries of the matrices\nare all 1, the Dovbysh-Sudakov theorem reads:\nTheorem 1.2. Let Q = {qij } be a ROSt. There exists a random element \u03bc of M(B) such\nthat conditionally on \u03bc,\nlaw\n(qij )i6=j = (v i * v j )i6=j ,\nwhere (v i , i \u2208 N) are iid \u03bc-distributed vectors in B.\n\nWe refer to the measure \u03bc as the sampling measure of the ROSt Q in this article. It plays\na role analogous to the empirical measure in de Finetti's theorem. The law of Q does not\ndetermine the sampling measure uniquely. However, there is a one-to-one correspondence\nbetween ROSt's and random elements of M(B) if the elements of M(B) that differ by an\nisometry are identified. The reader is referred to [25] for a proof.\nProposition 1.3. Let Q and Q\u2032 be two ROSt's with sampling measures \u03bc and \u03bc\u2032 . Then\nlaw\nQ = Q\u2032 if and only if there an isometry T of B (possibly dependent on the realization of \u03bc)\nlaw\nsuch that \u03bc(A) = \u03bc\u2032 (T \u22121 A) for any A \u2282 B Borel measurable.\nWe write v = (v 1 , ..., v s ) for an element of Bs and \u03bc\u2297s for the product measure of s\ncopies of \u03bc. Here s is an arbitrary positive integer. Each sampled vector is called a replica.\nThroughout the paper, expectation of a function F : Bs \u2192 R with respect to \u03bc\u2297s will often\n5\n\n\fbe written \u03bc\u2297s (F ) for short. In this notation, the continuous functionals (1.2) for ROSt's\nare all of the form\n\u0002\n\u0003\nP 7\u2192 E \u03bc\u2297s (F (v)) .\n(1.3)\n\nwhere F : Bs \u2192 R is a continuous function on s replicas, that is, a continuous function that\ndepends only on the inner product between s distinct vectors:\nF (v) = F (v k * v l ; 1 \u2264 k < l \u2264 s) .\n\nThe central topic of interest in this article is a class of ROSt's that possess an invariance\nproperty called stochastic stability. This is defined as follows.\nLet P be a ROSt. Let Pl be the law of a collection of independent standard Gaussian\nrandom variables (li , i \u2208 N), defined on the same probability space as P and independent of\nit. Let El denote integration\nP with respect to Pl . For each v \u2208 B, we consider the Gaussian\nrandom variable l(v) = i\u2208N li v * ei , where (ei , i \u2208 N) is a fixed orthonormal basis of H.\nThe covariance of l(v) and l(v \u2032 ) is given by\nEl [l(v)l(v \u2032 )] = v * v \u2032 .\nThe Gaussian process l = (l(v), v \u2208 B)Pindexed by B is called the cavity field in this article.\nNote that the function v 7\u2192 l(v) = i\u2208N li v * ei on B is measurable Pl -almost surely being\nthe pointwise limit of weakly continuous functions. Moreover, because EEl [\u03bc(l(v)2 )] \u2264 1 by\nFubini's theorem, for any law of ROSt P there exists a set of realizations of l of Pl -probability\none such that l(v) is well-defined for \u03bc-almost all v and for P-almost all \u03bc.\nWe now define the cavity mapping from the space of ROSt's to itself. The mapping is\ndefined on the sampling measure. Let \u03bb > 0 be a parameter, P be the law of a ROSt with\nsampling measure \u03bc, and l be a cavity field independent of P, we take:\n\u03a6\u03bb,l : \u03bc 7\u2192 \u03a6\u03bb,l \u03bc :=\n\ne\u03bbl(v)\u2212\n\n\u03bb2\n2\n\nkvk2\n2\n\n\u03bc(dv)\n\n\u03bbl(v)\u2212 \u03bb2 kvk2\n\n\u03bc(e\n\n)\n\n.\n\n(1.4)\n\nThe image ROSt is constructed using \u03a6\u03bb,l \u03bc as sampling measure. Its law is induced by\n\u03bb2\n\n2\n\nP \u00d7 Pl . We stress that the factor e 2 kvk is the expectation of e\u03bbl(v) , and its presence turns\nout to be crucial for the continuity of the mapping. The cavity mapping can also be defined\nin terms of the continuous functions (1.3) since they determine the law of the ROSt:\n#\n\"\n\u03bb2\n\u03bb2\n1 2\ns\ns 2\n1\n\u03bc\u2297s (F (v)e\u03bbl(v )\u2212 2 kv k ...e\u03bbl(v )\u2212 2 kv k )\n\u2297s\n\u2297s\nE[\u03bc (F (v))] 7\u2192 E[(\u03a6\u03bb,l \u03bc) (F (v))] = EEl\n.\n\u03bb2\n\u03bb2\n1 2\ns\ns 2\n1\n\u03bc\u2297s (e\u03bbl(v )\u2212 2 kv k ...e\u03bbl(v )\u2212 2 kv k )\nIt will be a consequence of Theorem 1.4 that the cavity mapping is well-defined, that is,\nthe image ROSt is the same if we apply (1.4) to two random elements of M(B) that are\nsampling measures of the same ROSt.\nWe remark that this mapping can be generalized in at least two ways. First, for any\n\u221a func\u03c8(l(v)+z 1\u2212kvk2 )\n1\n],\ntion \u03c8 \u2208 C (R) with bounded derivative, we can take the change of density Ez [e\nwhere z is a standard Gaussian with expectation Ez . Second, one could consider the cavity\nfield lc with El [lc (v)lc (v \u2032 )] = c(v * v \u2032 ) for some continuous function c satisfying\nc(1) = 1 (v, v \u2032 ) 7\u2192 c(v * v \u2032 ) is positive definite .\n6\n\n(1.5)\n\n\fWe will often write lp corresponding to the choice c(v *v \u2032 ) = (v *v \u2032 )p for p \u2208 N\u222a{0}. Equation\n(1.4) is the particular case \u03c8(x) = \u03bbx and c(x) = x. The generalized mapping takes the\nform\n\u221a\n2\nEz [e\u03c8(lc (v)+z 1\u2212c(kvk )) ] \u03bc(dv)\n\u221a\n.\n(1.6)\n\u03a6\u03c8,lc : \u03bc 7\u2192 \u03a6\u03c8,lc \u03bc :=\n\u03c8(lc (v)+z 1\u2212c(kvk2 ))\n])\n\u03bc(Ez [e\nThe first result of this paper, from which all others essentially stem, is proved in Section\n2.\nTheorem 1.4. The mapping from the space of ROSt's to itself defined by (1.6) is continuous.\nWe are interested in ROSt's whose law is invariant under the cavity mapping (1.6). This\nis equivalent to say by Proposition 1.3 that the sampling measure \u03bc has the same law as\n\u03a6\u03c8,lc \u03bc, up to an isometry of B. One direct consequence of the continuity is that the set of\ninvariant laws under a family of cavity mappings is compact in the space of laws of ROSt's\n(see Corollary 4.1), a simple fact that will turn out to be useful, for example in the proof of\nthe Parisi formula (see Corollary 3.7). Our focus is on ROSt's whose law is invariant under\nthe cavity mapping for linear functions \u03c8.\nDefinition 1.5. A ROSt of law P is called stochastically stable if, for any \u03bb > 0, its law is\ninvariant under the cavity mapping (1.4). In other words, for any s \u2208 N and any continuous\nfunction F on s replicas\nE[\u03bc\u2297s (F (v))] = E[(\u03a6\u03bb,l \u03bc)\u2297s (F (v))] .\nIt is called stochastically stable for the cavity field lc if the above holds with l replaced by the\ncavity field lc with covariance El [lc (v)lc (v \u2032 )] = c(v * v \u2032 ).\nAs we shall explain in the next section, continuity provides the missing link between\nthe stochastic stability as defined here and stochastic stability of the Gibbs measure of\nspin glasses as studied in [2, 13, 31]. This link provides a statement of the ultrametricity\nconjecture on the characterization of stochastically stable ROSt's.\nConjecture 1 (Ultrametricity Conjecture). If a ROSt of law P is stochastically stable for\nthe cavity fields lp (defined below (1.6)) for p = 1 and infinitely many p, then the support of\nits sampling measure \u03bc is ultrametric P-a.s., that is:\nv * v \u2032 \u2265 min {v * v \u2032\u2032 , v \u2032 * v \u2032\u2032 } for \u03bc\u22973 -almost all v, v \u2032 , v \u2032\u2032 .\nMoreover, the law of the sampling measure is a convex combination of Ruelle Probability\nCascades.\nRuelle Probability Cascades (RPC's) form a compact subset of ROSt's parametrized by\nthe right-continuous, increasing functions on [0, 1] with values 0 at 0 and 1 at 1 (we refer\nto [7] for a proof of the compactness). They have ultrametric support and they are known\nto be stochastically stable for any cavity field lp , p \u2208 N. We shall not need their precise\ndefinition here. The reader is referred to [27, 11, 5] for more details. It is very likely that\nthe hypotheses of the conjecture can be relaxed. However, it does not hold if stochastic\nstability for a single cavity field is assumed. A simple counterexample is given at the end\n7\n\n\fof Section 4. The conjecture was proved in the case where the support of \u03bc\u22972 is finite in\n[5] (see also [21] for an extension of that proof). In this case, \u03bc is supported on countable\nvectors and the conjecture can be formulated in the language of competing particle systems.\nA similar statement of the ultrametricity conjecture exists where the assumption of stability\nis replaced with the extended Ghirlanda-Guerra identities:\nDefinition 1.6. A ROSt with sampling measure \u03bc is said to satisfy the Ghirlanda-Guerra\n(GG) Identities if for any s \u2208 N and any continuous function F on s replicas we have\nE[\u03bc\u2297s+1 (v 1 * v s+1F (v))]\n\ns\n\n1\n1X\n= E[\u03bc\u22972 (v 1 * v 2 )] E[\u03bc\u2297s (F (v))] +\nE[\u03bc\u2297s (v 1 * v l F (v))] .\ns\ns\nl=2\n\nIt is said to satisfy the extended Ghirlanda-Guerra identities if the above holds when the\nproducts v i * v j in the expectations is replaced by (v i * v j )p for any p \u2208 N.\nA version of the ultrametricity conjecture assuming finiteness of the support of the overlap\ndistribution and the extended Ghirlanda-Guerra identities was proved by Panchenko in the\ncase where \u03bc\u22972 has finite support [23]. (The assumptions are slightly different from the\nones used in the proof of the conjecture using stochastic stability in [5] where stability for\ninfinitely many p's in N, but not all p, is needed. However, it is possible that the two sets\nof hypotheses are equivalent in the special case where the support is finite.) We also stress\nthat ultrametricity has been proved for generalized versions of GREM spin glass models by\nBolthausen and Kistler [9, 10].\nThe continuity of the cavity mapping has interesting consequences that we discuss in\nSection 4. For one, it provides an ergodic decomposition of stochastically stable ROSt's.\nThe Ultrametricity Conjecture can then be restated by saying that the extremes of the\nconsidered set of stochastically stable ROSt's are exactly the RPC's. The decomposition is\nuseful to prove properties of the support of the sampling measure. We stress that invariance\nunder a single cavity mapping is sufficient here.\nTheorem 1.7. Let P be the law of a ROSt that is invariant under the cavity mapping \u03a6\u03bb,l\nfor a given \u03bb > 0. Let \u03bc be its sampling measure. Then \u03bc is supported on a single vector or\non an infinite-dimensional subset of B.\nIf invariance under more fields is assumed, we can prove more.\nTheorem 1.8. Let P be the law of a ROSt that is invariant under the cavity mapping \u03a6\u03bb,lp\nfor a given \u03bb > 0 and for infinitely many p \u2208 N. Let \u03bc be its sampling measure and suppose\n2\nthat \u03bc\u22972 {(v, v \u2032) \u2208 B2 : |v * v \u2032 | = rmax\n(\u03bc)} > 0 on a set of positive P-probability, where\nrmax (\u03bc) = sup{0 \u2264 r \u2264 1 : \u03bc{kvk \u2265 r} > 0}. Then,\n\u03bc{v \u2208 B : kvk = rmax (\u03bc)} = 1 P-a.s.\nIn other words, \u03bc is almost surely supported on a sphere.\nThis last property does not hold in general if stability is assumed for a single cavity field.\nA counter-example is given in Section 4.\n8\n\n\fProperties of the sampling measure for ROSt's satisfying the extended Ghirlanda-Guerra\nidentities have been obtained in [23]. The apparent similarities of the properties of the ROSt's\nsatisfying the Ghirlanda-Guerra identities and stochastic stability motivate the following\nquestion: are the Ghirlanda-Guerra identities and stochastic stability two representations\nof the same property ? Since the set of stochastic stable ROSt's is closed under convex\ncombinations and not the set of ROSt's satisfying GG, we conjecture the following:\nConjecture 2. The laws of the ROSt's satisfying the Ghirlanda-Guerra identities correspond\nto the extremes of the convex set of laws of the stochastically stable ROSt's.\n\n1.2\n\nApplication to Spin Glasses\n\nConsider a Gaussian spin glass Hamiltonian HN and its Gibbs measures G\u03b2,N at \u03b2 as defined\nin the introduction. It is straightforward to construct a ROSt Q\u03b2,N from G\u03b2,N by taking\nQ\u03b2,N = { r(\u03c3 i , \u03c3 j ) }i,j\u2208N\nwhere (\u03c3 i )i\u2208N are elements of {\u22121, +1}N sampled iid from G\u03b2,N . Here the form \"r\" is the\none of the given spin glass model, but the same construction holds for any positive definite\nsymmetric form on {\u22121, +1}N . Note that the randomness of Q\u03b2,N comes from the sampling\nand the randomness of G\u03b2,N itself.\nThe considerations of the previous sections ensure that the random matrix Q\u03b2,N can be\nconstructed from a random sampling measure \u03bc\u03b2,N on B. In particular, for any function F\non s replicas there is the identity\n\u2297s\nk\nl\nE G\u03b2,N\n(F (r(\u03c3 k , \u03c3 l ); 1 \u2264 k < l \u2264 s)) = E \u03bc\u2297s\n\u03b2,N (F (v * v ; 1 \u2264 k < l \u2264 s)) .\n\n(1.7)\n\nThe sequence (Q\u03b2,N ) in the space of ROSt's has limit points, since the space is compact.\nThese limits should retain in some ways the Gibbsian nature of G\u03b2,N . Two properties of\nthe limit points seem to be of importance: the Ghirlanda-Guerra identities as presented\nearlier and the stochastic stability for the sequence of sampling measure (\u03bc\u03b2,N ). Stochastic\nstability for the sequence defined below does not directly translate into stochastic stability\nas presented earlier of the limit ROSt. As we shall see, Theorem 1.4 fills this gap.\nStochastic stability was first introduced in [2] and originally defined as follows. Let (G\u03b2,N )\nbe a sequence of Gibbs measures at inverse temperature \u03b2. Consider similarly as before the\nGaussian field (l(\u03c3) : \u03c3 \u2208 {\u22121, +1}N ) independent of HN , whose law we again denote by\nEl , with covariance El [l(\u03c3)l(\u03c3 \u2032 )] = r(\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 ). For some \u03bb > 0, we consider the mapping (1.4).\nSince here k\u03c3k = 1 for any vector in the support, it reduces to\nG\u03b2,N (\u03c3) 7\u2192\n\nG\u03b2,N (\u03c3)e\u03bbl(\u03c3)\n.\nG\u03b2,N (e\u03bbl(\u03c3) )\n\n(1.8)\n\nIt is readily checked by property ofpGaussians that the image in (1.8) has the same law as\nthe Gibbs measure at temperature \u03b2 2 + \u03bb2 /N. The original idea of [2] is that a continuous\ndependence on \u03b2 of the Gibbs measure is equivalent in the limit N \u2192 \u221e to stability of the\nmeasure under the mapping (1.8).\n9\n\n\fDefinition 1.9. A sequence of Gibbs measures (GN ) is said to be stochastically stable if for\nany \u03bb > 0, s \u2208 N and for any continuous function F on s replicas,\n\"\n#\n1\ns\n\u2297s\nGN\n(F (\u03c3)e\u03bbl(\u03c3 ) ...e\u03bbl(\u03c3 ) )\n\u2297s\nlim EEl\n\u2212 EGN\n(F (\u03c3)) = 0 ,\n\u2297s \u03bbl(\u03c31 )\nN \u2192\u221e\nGN\n(e\n...e\u03bbl(\u03c3s ) )\nwhere F (\u03c3) stands for F (r(\u03c3 l , \u03c3 k ); 1 \u2264 k < l \u2264 s).\nIt was shown in [13] that stochastic stability in the sense of Definition 1.9 holds on\naverage over \u03b2. An improvement was made in [31] where it is proved that for any \u03b2 and\nsequence of Gibbs measures (G\u03b2,N ) there exists a sequence \u03b2N \u2192 \u03b2 such that the sequence\n(G\u03b2N ,N ) is stochastically stable. We show here that stochastic stability holds at any \u03b2 where\nlimN \u2192\u221e N1 E log ZN (\u03b2) is differentiable. This is an analogue of an elegant result of Panchenko\n[24] which proves the validity of the Ghirlanda-Guerra identities under the same hypothesis.\nProposition 1.10. If limN \u2192\u221e N1 E log ZN (\u03b2) exists and is differentiable at \u03b2 > 0, then the\nsequence of Gibbs measures (G\u03b2,N ) is stochastically stable in the sense of Definition 1.9.\nProof. Let F be a continuous function on s replicas. We must have |F | \u2264 C for some C > 0.\nStraightforward differentiation yields\nh\u0010\ni\n\u0001\u0001\n\u2297s\n\u2297s\nHN (\u03c3 1 ) \u2212 G\u03b2,N HN (\u03c3) F (\u03c3) .\n\u2202\u03b2 EG\u03b2,N\n(F (\u03c3)) = s EG\u03b2,N\nHence the absolute value of the derivative is bounded by\n\nsC EG\u03b2,N HN (\u03c3 1 ) \u2212 G\u03b2,N HN (\u03c3)\nDefine \u03b2(\u03bb) :=\n\n\u0001\n\n.\n\np\n\u03b2 2 + \u03bb2 /N.

(1.9)\n\n\u03b2\n\nIt remains to show that the integral goes to zero under the assumption. We have by CauchySchwarz inequality\nZ \u03b2(\u03bb)\nEG\u03b2 \u2032 ,N |HN (\u03c3) \u2212 G\u03b2 \u2032 ,N (HN (\u03c3))| d\u03b2 \u2032\n\u03b2\n\n\u2264 N 1/2 \u03b2(\u03bb) \u2212 \u03b2\n2\n\n\u00011/2\n\nZ\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b2(\u03bb)\n\n1\nEG\u03b2 \u2032 ,N |HN (\u03c3) \u2212 G\u03b2 \u2032 ,N (HN (\u03c3))|2 d\u03b2 \u2032\nN\n\n!1/2\n\n.\n\n\u03bb\nSince \u03b2(\u03bb) \u2212 \u03b2 = 2\u03b2N\n+ O( N12 ), stochastic stability in the sense of Definition 1.9 would follow\nby equation (1.9) if the term in the parentheses divided by N goes to zero as N \u2192 \u221e. Define\nfN (\u03b2) := N1 E log ZN (\u03b2). fN is famously convex. It is easily checked by differentiation that\nthe integral to bound is exactly\nfN\u2032 (\u03b2(\u03bb)) \u2212 fN\u2032 (\u03b2).\n\nSince \u03b2(\u03bb) \u2192 \u03b2, the above goes to zero by a simple result of convexity (see Lemma 3.6) as\nwell as the assumptions on the existence of the limit and the derivative at \u03b2.\n10\n\n\fA direct consequence of Theorem 1.4 is that stochastic stability as a property of the\nsequence becomes a property of the limit points.\nCorollary 1.11. If limN \u2192\u221e N1 E log ZN (\u03b2) exists and is differentiable at \u03b2 > 0, then the\nlimit points in the space of ROSt's of the sequence (Q\u03b2,N ) are stochastically stable in the\nsense of Definition 1.5.\nAnother notable application of the continuity of the cavity mapping is a proof that\nthe Parisi functionals, entering in the Parisi formula of the SK model, are continuous as\nfunctionals on ROSt's. This is proved in Section 2.2 and can be seen as a generalization\nof a theorem of Guerra that proved the continuity within the subset of Ruelle Probability\nCascades [15, 4]. Assuming that the Ultrametricity Conjecture holds, this fact, together\nwith Guerra's bound and Corollary 1.11, provides a proof of the Parisi formula for the SK\nmodel (and more generally, for mixed p-spin models with even p's). This is done in Section\n3.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nThe Cavity Mapping\nContinuity\n\nIn this section, we prove the continuity of the mapping (1.4). Let \u03c8 be a function in C 1 (R)\nwith bounded derivative, |\u03c8 \u2032 | \u2264 C for some C > 0. Assume without loss of generality that\n\u03c8(0) = 0. Let z a standard Gaussian variable with law Pz and expectation Ez . Note that,\nunder these assumptions, |\u03c8(z)| \u2264 C|z|, and in particular Ez [em\u03c8(z) ] < \u221e for any m \u2208 R.\nDefine\n\u221a\n2\n(2.1)\nG(v, z, l) := e\u03c8(l(v)+z 1\u2212kvk ) .\nIn the cases \u03c8(x) = x and \u03c8(x) = log cosh x, we have the simplification\n1\n\n2)\n\nEz G(v, z, l) = e\u03c8(l(v)) e 2 (1\u2212kvk\n\n.\n\nWhen dealing with s replicas, that is v = (v 1 , ..., v s ) \u2208 Bs and z = (z 1 , ..., z s ) where z has\nlaw Pz\u2297s , write\ns\nY\nG(v, z, l) :=\nG(v i , z i , l) .\n(2.2)\ni=1\n\nConsider the generalized cavity mapping (1.6):\n\u03bc 7\u2192 \u03a6\u03c8,l \u03bc :=\n\n\u03bc(dv) Ez G(v, z, l)\n,\n\u03bc(Ez G(v, z, l))\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere l(v) is the cavity field with covariance v * v \u2032 . The proof of the continuity is the same\nwhen the covariance of the field is c(v *v \u2032 ), for a suitable function c, if kvk2 in the definition of\nG is replaced by c(kvk2 ). We restrict ourselves to the case where c is the identity to simplify\nnotation.\nConsider a function F = F (v, z, l) that depends measurably on s replicas, the Gaussian vector z and the cavity field. The main ingredient of the proof of continuity is an\napproximation in the spirit of the weak law of large numbers.\n11\n\n\fLemma 2.1. Let \u03bc \u2208 M(B). Let F (v, z, l) be a function such that v 7\u2192 El Ez\u2297s [F (v, z, l)2 ]\nis a continuous function on s replicas.

Let \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 > 0, c be as in (1.5) and P be the law of a ROSt. If P\u2032 is the image\nof P under \u03a6\u03bb,lc and P\u2032\u2032 is the image of P\u2032 under \u03a6\u03bb\u2032 ,lc\u2032 , then P\u2032\u2032 is the image of P under\n\u03a6\u221a\u03bb2 +\u03bb\u20322 ,lc .

They enter in\nparticular in the Parisi formula for the free energy of the SK model.\nLet \u03c8 \u2208 C 1 (R) with bounded derivative and with \u03c8(0) = 0. Consider a cavity field lc\nwith covariance El [lc (v)lc (v \u2032 )] = c(v * v \u2032 ) for some function c as in (1.5).

We drop the dependence on c\nand on \u03c8 in the notation for simplicity. The cases where \u03c8(x) = log cosh x or \u03c8(x) = x, and\nX\n1 X 2 p\n\u03bb2 =\n\u03bb2p\nc(x) = 2\n\u03bb x\n\u03bb p\u22650 p\np\u22650\n15\n\n\fwill play an important role in Section 3. In these cases, the variable z can be integrated.\nThe functional (2.12) reduces to\nP(\u03bb, P) :=\n\nh\n\u0010 P\n\u0011i\n1 P\n\u03bb2\n2\n2p\n+ E El log \u03bc e\u03c8( p\u22650 \u03bbp lp (v))\u2212 2 p\u22650 \u03bbp kvk\n,\n2\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere \u03bb = (\u03bbp )p\u22650 and El is the expectation over independent cavity fields lp , p \u2208 N \u222a {0}.\nThe dependence on each \u03bbp is emphasized here by writing P(\u03bb, P) instead of P(\u03bb, P).\nContinuity of the Parisi functional on the subset of Ruelle Probability Cascades has been\nestablished by Guerra [15]. In this case, the Parisi functionals equals f (0, 0), where f (q, y)\nis the solution of a p.d.e. with final condition f (1, y) = \u03c8(\u03bby), see e.g. [3, 4] for details. It\nturns out that continuity properties of the Parisi functionals that are needed in the proof of\nthe Parisi formula can be established for the whole space of ROSt's.\nProposition 2.5.

P 7\u2192 P(\u03bb, P) is a continuous functional on ROSt's for every \u03bb \u2265 0.\n2. In the cases where \u03c8(x) = log cosh x and \u03c8(x) = x as in (2.13), it holds for any \u03b4 > 0\nand any given \u03bb\u2032 = (\u03bb\u2032p )p\u22650 \u2208 l2 that\nif k\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 k2 < \u03b4, then max |P(\u03bb, P) \u2212 P(\u03bb\u2032 , P)| \u2264 Kk\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 k2\nP ROSt\n\nwhere K > 0 depends on \u03bb\u2032 and \u03b4.\nProof. We prove the first claim. We show that P(\u03bb, P) is differentiable in \u03bb and that the\nderivative is a continuous function on ROSt's. The conclusion follows by integration.\nWe write for short\np\ng(v, z) := l(v) + z 1 \u2212 c(kvk2) ,\n\nomitting the dependence on l. Note that under El Ez , the g's are all centered Gaussian\nvariables of variance 1.

The main new result\nis Theorem 3.5, which gives a lower bound for the free energy in terms of a functional of a\nlimit point of the sequence of Gibbs measures in the space of ROSt's. The proof uses the\ntreatment of Talagrand for the high-temperature regime (Theorem 2.4.19 in [29]) and the\ncontinuity of the Parisi functionals on the space of ROSt's. The compactness of the set of\nROSt's that are invariant under a family of cavity mappings, which is a consequence of the\ncontinuity of such mappings, will also be crucial (see Corollary 3.7). The Parisi formula is\nthen a consequence of Guerra's bound and the Ultrametricity Conjecture.\nThe p-spin Hamiltonian HNp on {\u22121, +1}N ,\n(HNp (\u03c3), \u03c3 \u2208 {\u22121, +1}N ) ,\nis a centered Gaussian vector with covariances EHNp (\u03c3)HNp (\u03c3 \u2032 ) = NR(\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 )p , where R(\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 ) =\nPN\n1\n\u2032\ni=1 \u03c3i \u03c3i .

In\nthis section, we will be concerned with the mixed Hamiltonian\nX\nHN (\u03c3) =\n\u03b2p HNp (\u03c3)\np\n\nwhere the summation is restricted throughout this section to p = 1 and even p's. Take\n\u03b2p \u2208 R+ for simplicity since HN has the same law for positive and negative values of the\n19\n\n\fparameters. For the appropriate cavity field to be well-defined, the parameters \u03b2 := (\u03b2p )\nwill need to decay so that\nX\n2p \u03b2p2 < \u221e .\n(3.2)\np\n\n(We stress that this decay is most likely P\nnot optimal.)

The norm is then k\u03b2k = p 2 \u03b2p2 .\nThe Gibbs measure at the value \u03b2 of the parameters is\nG\u03b2,N (\u03c3) =\n\nexp HN (\u03c3)\n,\nZN (\u03b2)\n\nP\nwhere ZN (\u03b2) = \u03c3 exp HN (\u03c3). As mentioned in Section 1.2, a ROSt can be constructed\nfrom the random probability measures (G\u03b2,N ). The corresponding sequence of laws will be\ndenoted by (P\u03b2,N ). The corresponding sampling measures defined through (1.7) will be\ndenoted by (\u03bc\u03b2,N ). Since the space of ROSt's is compact, the sequence (P\u03b2,N ) has limit\npoints. We will denote a generic limit point by P\u03b2 and its sampling measure by \u03bc\u03b2 .\nOur goal is to express the free energy of the Hamiltonian\n1\nE log ZN (\u03b2)\nN \u2192\u221e N\n\nf (\u03b2) := lim\n\nas a functional of a limit point P\u03b2 . For the mixed Hamiltonian with p = 1 and even p's, the\nexistence of the limit was proved by Guerra and Toninelli [17]. We also know from the work\nof Guerra [15] and Talagrand [30] that f (\u03b2) is expressed by the celebrated Parisi formula.\nWe write it here in terms of Ruelle Probability Cascades (RPC's). The reader is referred to\n[4] for the correspondence between this formulation and the one in terms of PDE's.\nTheorem 3.1 (The Parisi Formula).

The minimum is over the laws of the Ruelle Probability\nCascades, a compact subset of the laws of ROSt's. The sampling measure of P is denoted by\n\u03bc.\nIt can be checked that for any ROSt that is stochastically stable for the cavity fields lp ,\nso in particular for the RPC's, the second functional in the Parisi formula,\nP 7\u2192\n\nX (p \u2212 1)\u03b2p2 \u0010\np\n\n2\n\n\u22972\n\n\u2032 p\n\n1 \u2212 E\u03bc (v * v )\n\n\u0011\n\nP\n2\nis equal to the Parisi functional (2.13) for \u03c8(x) = x, \u03bb2 =\np (p \u2212 1)\u03b2p , and c(x) =\nP (p\u22121)\u03b2p2 p\nx.\np\n\u03bb2\nThe proof in [30] of the Parisi Formula is not constructive. Our goal is to provide\na constructive demonstration in the spirit of Aizenman, Sims and Starr [3] and Theorem\n20\n\n\f2.4.19 of [29] by assuming that the Ultrametricity Conjecture holds. This way of proceeding\nis based on general properties of ROSt's. Moreover, we emphasize that we will not use the\nultrametric structure of the RPC explicitly, but simply that the stochastic stability properties\ncharacterize the RPC family from the conjecture.\nThe first ingredient of the proof is an upper bound proved by Guerra [15].\nTheorem 3.2 (Guerra's bound).

It uses explicitly the tree structure of the cascades. The\nproof of this bound can be also done using the approach of Aizenman, Sims and Starr [3].\nIn this case, the proof does not use the ultrametric structure of the cascade explicitly, but\nsimply the stability of the cascades under the cavity mapping with function \u03c8(x) = log cosh x\nand \u03c8(x) = x. The reader is referred to [3, 4] for more details.\nIt remains to establish the matching lower bound. We begin by a standard lemma, whose\nproof using Jensen's inequality will be helpful in this section.\nLemma 3.3. The function \u03b2 7\u2192 f (\u03b2) is convex and continuous in the space of \u03b2 satisfying\n(3.2).\nProof. We set fN (\u03b2) := N1 E log ZN (\u03b2). The fact that fN (\u03b2) is convex follows by H\u00f6lder's\ninequality, and the convexity of f (\u03b2) is proved since it is the pointwise limit of fN (\u03b2). We\nnow show that the family (fN (\u03b2))N is equicontinuous in \u03b2.\nFirst note that fN (\u03b2) is an increasing function of its parameters, since by Gaussian\nintegration by part,\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u22972\n(3.3)\nDp fN (\u03b2) = \u03b2p 1 \u2212 EG\u03b2,N\nR(\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 )p \u2265 0 ,\nwhere Dp is the partial derivative in the p-th coordinate. Let \u03b2 and \u03b2 \u2032 satisfy (3.2). Let us\ndefine \u03b2 \u2212 with \u03b2p\u2212 := min{\u03b2p , \u03b2p\u2032 }. By construction, fN (\u03b2 \u2212 ) \u2264 fN (\u03b2) and fN (\u03b2 \u2212 ) \u2264 fN (\u03b2 \u2032 ).\nWe show that\n1X\nfN (\u03b2) \u2212 fN (\u03b2 \u2212 ) \u2264\n(\u03b2p \u2212 \u03b2p\u2212 )2 ,\n(3.4)\n2 p\n\nand similarly for fN (\u03b2 \u2032 ).

It follows that f (\u03b2) is\n2\ncontinuous in \u03b2 in the sense of the norm k\u03b2k = p 2 \u03b2p .\n\nIt is well-known that a convex function on R is differentiable almost everywhere. It\nturns out that a similar statement is true for a continuous convex functional on an infinitedimensional space. Indeed, it is a theorem of Mazur that a continuous convex functional on\nany open convex subset of a separable Banach space has a dense set of points of differentiability (in the sense that the directional derivative exists in all directions), see e.g. Theorem\n1.20 in [22]. Applying this to the Hilbert space of \u03b2 satisfying (3.2), we get\nLemma 3.4.

Since \u03b4 was arbitrary, the theorem is proved.\nThe connection between the lower bound of Theorem 3.5 and the actual Parisi formula\nwith RPC's will be provided by the Ultrametricity Conjecture. The idea is to use the lower\nbound of Theorem 3.5 for \u03b2 where \u03b2p > 0 for all p's. The limit ROSt's P\u03b2 for such a choice\npossesses strong invariance properties by Corollary 1.11 if \u03b2 is a point of differentiability\nof f . However, it is not guaranteed that \u03b2 is a point of differentiability. Even worse,\nMazur's theorem does not ensure that the points of differentiability are dense in the subset\n{\u03b2 : \u03b2p > 0 \u2200p} since it is not open. This apparent difficulty is however bypassed by the use\nof subsequences and by the continuity of the cavity mapping.\nCorollary 3.7. Let \u03b2 with \u03b2p > 0 for p = 1 and even p's. There exists a ROSt of law P\u03b2\nand sampling measure \u03bc\u03b2 that is stochastically stable for the cavity fields lp , p = 1 and all p\neven, and for which\n\u0011\nX (p \u2212 1)\u03b2p2 \u0010\n\u2032 p\n.\n1 \u2212 E\u03bc\u22972\n(v\n*\nv\n)\nf (\u03b2) \u2265 log 2 + P(\u03bb\u03b2 , P\u03b2 ) \u2212\n\u03b2\n2\np\n24\n\n\fProof. By Lemma 3.4, there exists a sequence of points of differentiability \u03b2 m , m \u2208 N, that\nconverges to \u03b2. Hence the inequality (3.6) is satisfied for any \u03b2 m for some ROSt's of law\nP\u03b2m . Recall that P\u03b2m is the limit law of the ROSt's constructed from the Gibbs measures\nG\u03b2m ,N . It follows from Corollary 1.11 that P\u03b2m is stochastically stable for the cavity fields lp\nfor all p \u2264 p(m), where p(m) \u2264 \u221e is the greatest p such that (\u03b2 m )p > 0. Since the space of\nROSt's is compact, there exists a subsequence of m's for which P\u03b2m converges to the law of\nsome ROSt denoted P\u03b2 . Moreover, since the cavity mapping is continuous, any limit point of\na sequence of laws that are invariant under a cavity mapping is also invariant. This implies\nthat P\u03b2 is stochastically stable for the cavity fields lp for all relevant p's (since p(m) goes to\ninfinity with m from the hypothesis that \u03b2p > 0 for all p).\nBy Lemma 3.3, f (\u03b2 m ) \u2192 f (\u03b2). To prove the inequality (3.6) for \u03b2, it remains to show\nthat the right-hand side also converges for the considered subsequence of \u03b2 m . This is clear\nfor the second term since \u03b2 m \u2192 \u03b2 and P\u03b2m \u2192 P\u03b2 . For the second term, one has\n|P(\u03bb\u03b2m , P\u03b2m ) \u2212 P(\u03bb\u03b2 , P\u03b2 )| \u2264 |P(\u03bb\u03b2m , P\u03b2m ) \u2212 P(\u03bb\u03b2 , P\u03b2m )| + |P(\u03bb\u03b2 , P\u03b2m ) \u2212 P(\u03bb\u03b2 , P\u03b2 )|\n\u2264 max |P(\u03bb\u03b2m , P) \u2212 P(\u03bb\u03b2 , P)| + |P(\u03bb\u03b2 , P\u03b2m ) \u2212 P(\u03bb\u03b2 , P\u03b2 )| .\nP ROSt\n\nThe right-hand side goes to zero\nof \u03b2 m by Proposition 2.5 because\nPalong the2 subsequence\n2\nP\u03b2m \u2192 P\u03b2 and k\u03bb\u03b2m \u2212 \u03bb\u03b2 k2 = p p((\u03b2 m )p \u2212 \u03b2p ) \u2264 k\u03b2 m \u2212 \u03b2k.\n\nProof of Theorem 3.1 using Conjecture 1. By Conjecture 1, the only stochastically stable\nROSt's for infinitely many p's are convex combinations of RPC's. Therefore, by Corollary\n3.7 and Guerra's bound, the Parisi formula is established at any point \u03b2 with \u03b2p > 0 for all\np. (Note that the functionals that are minimized in the Parisi formula are linear functions in\nthe law of the ROSt's. In particular, the minimum can be restricted to RPC's as opposed to\nconvex combinations of RPC's.) It remains to show that the Parisi formula holds at all \u03b2,\nincluding those \u03b2 with \u03b2p = 0 for some p. Since f is continuous in the space of parameters\nsatisfying (3.2), it suffices to show that the functional\n)\n(\n\u0011\nX (p \u2212 1)\u03b2p2 \u0010\n1 \u2212 E\u03bc\u22972 (v * v \u2032 )p\n(3.12)\n\u03b2 7\u2192 min P(\u03bb\u03b2 , P) \u2212\nP RPC\n2\np\nP\nis continuous under the norm k\u03b2k2 = p 2p \u03b2p2 . We write for convenience \u039b(\u03b2, P) for the\nfunctional in the argument of the minimum. By Proposition 2.5, \u039b(\u03b2, *) is a continuous\nfunctional on ROSt's. We denote by P\u03b2 the RPC where the minimum of \u039b(\u03b2, *) is attained.\nSince we minimize \u039b over ROSt's, we have trivially\n\u039b(\u03b2, P\u03b2 ) \u2212 \u039b(\u03b2 \u2032 , P\u03b2 ) \u2264 min \u039b(\u03b2, P) \u2212 min \u039b(\u03b2 \u2032 , P) \u2264 \u039b(\u03b2, P\u03b2\u2032 ) \u2212 \u039b(\u03b2 \u2032 , P\u03b2\u2032 ) .\nP RPC\n\nP RPC\n\n(3.13)\n\nOn the other hand, if \u03b2 is close enough to \u03b2 \u2032 , we have for some K > 0,\nmax |\u039b(\u03b2, P) \u2212 \u039b(\u03b2\u2032 , P)| \u2264 Kk\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2032 k .\n\nP ROSt\n\nThis is because, by the second part of Proposition 2.5,\n(\n)1/2\n(\n)1/2\nX\nX\nmax |P(\u03bb\u03b2 , P) \u2212 P(\u03bb\u03b2\u2032 , P)| \u2264 K\np(\u03b2p \u2212 \u03b2p\u2032 )2\n\u2264K\n2p (\u03b2p \u2212 \u03b2p\u2032 )2\n,\nP ROSt\n\np\n\np\n\n25\n\n\fand the same holds by inspection for the second functional entering in the definition of \u039b.\nThe continuity of (3.12) in the space of \u03b2 satisfying (3.2) follows from (3.13) and the above\nestimate.\n\n4\n\nProperties of Stochastically Stable ROSt's\n\nSome particular properties of stochastically stable ROSt's were essential in the proof of the\nultrametricity conjecture in [5] and [23], where strong assumptions on the ROSt were needed\n(e.g., finiteness of the support for the law of the entries). Here we show similar properties in\na general settting which may be useful for the proof of the conjecture in the general case.\nA direct consequence of the continuity of the cavity mapping is the compactness of the\nset of stochastically stable ROSt's.\nCorollary 4.1. The set of laws of ROSt's that are invariant under a (possibly infinite)\nfamily of cavity mappings of the form (1.6) is convex and compact. In particular, the set of\nlaws of the stochastically stable ROSt's is convex and compact.\nProof. Convexity is clear. The compactness of the set of laws of ROSt's that are invariant\nunder the mapping (1.6) for a given \u03c8 and a given positive definite form c is a consequence\nof continuity of the mapping (Theorem 1.4). Compactness also holds for sets of ROSt's that\nare invariant under an infinite number of mappings (e.g., for all parameters \u03bb > 0) since in\na compact space an arbitrary intersection of compact sets is compact.\nCorollary 4.1 yields a standard ergodic decomposition for the different sets of stochastically stable ROSt's by Choquet's theorem: the law of a ROSt in such a convex set can be\nwritten as the barycenter of some probability measure on the extreme points of the set. This\nis useful since many functions of interest on the sampling measure of a ROSt turn out to be\nconstant when the law is an extreme point. This is helpful when proving properties of the\nsampling measure of stochastically stable ROSt's.\nDefinition 4.2. We say a function h : M(B) \u2192 R is an invariant function of the cavity\nmapping \u03a6\u03c8,lc defined in (1.6) if: 1) it is Borel measurable; 2) for any isometry T of B,\nh(\u03bc) = h(T \u22121 \u03bc); 3) h(\u03bc) = h(\u03a6\u03c8,lc \u03bc) Pl -almost surely.\nLemma 4.3. Let h : M(B) \u2192 R be an invariant function of a (possibly infinite) family of\ncavity mapping (\u03a6\u03c8,lc ), where the collection is over different \u03c8's and c's. Let P be the law\nof a ROSt with sampling measure \u03bc. If P is an extreme point of the set of laws that are\ninvariant under the family (\u03a6\u03c8,lc ), then the random variable h(\u03bc) is constant P-a.s.\nProof. If h is not a constant, we have the non-trivial decomposition of P\nZ\nP=\nP( * | h(\u03bc) = y) Ph\u22121 (dy) .\n\n(4.1)\n\nR\n\nOn the other hand, P( * |h(\u03bc)) is invariant under the same family of mapping (\u03a6\u03c8,lc ) for\nP-almost all h(\u03bc). Indeed, for any Borel measurable function g on M(B), invariant under\nisometry, any Borel measurable function F : R \u2192 R, and every \u03a6\u03c8,lc in the collection,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nE[g(\u03bc)F h(\u03bc) ] = EEl [g(\u03a6\u03c8,lc \u03bc)F h(\u03a6\u03c8,lc \u03bc) ] = EEl [g(\u03a6\u03c8,lc \u03bc)F h(\u03bc) ] ,\n26\n\n\fwhere the first equality follows from the invariance of P and the second, from the invariance\nof h. Thus (4.1) contradicts the assumption that P is an extreme point and the claim\nfollows.\nBy inspection of the form of the cavity mapping (1.6), we expect that the support of a\nmeasure \u03bc is not affected by the cavity mapping, since the mapping modifies only the weight\nof the vectors and not their relative position. We make this idea precise in the following\nlemma.\nLemma 4.4. Let \u03bc \u2208 M(B) and \u03a6\u03c8,lc as in (1.6). Then \u03a6\u03c8,lc \u03bc is equivalent to \u03bc Pl -almost\nsurely, that is: for any non-negative measurable function f on B,\nZ\nZ\nf (v) \u03bc(dv) = 0 if and only if\nf (v)\u03a6\u03c8,lc \u03bc(dv) = 0 Pl -a.s.\nB\n\nB\n\nProof. Note first that\n\u221a\n2\nf (v) Ez [e\u03c8(lc (v)+z 1\u2212c(kvk )) ]\n\u221a\nf (v)\u03a6\u03c8,lc \u03bc(dv) =\n\u03bc(dv)\n2\nB \u03bc(Ez [e\u03c8(lc (v)+z 1\u2212c(kvk )) ])\nB\n\u221a\nR\n\u03c8(lc (v)+z 1\u2212c(kvk2 ))\n]\u03bc(dv) = 0.

This is\nOn the other hand,\nwe\nnote\nthat\nE\n[e\nz\np\n2\nbecause lc (v) + z 1 \u2212 c(kvk ) is finite Pl \u00d7 Pz -a.s. and \u03bc-a.e., since by Fubini,\nZ\np\nEl Ez |lc (v) + z 1 \u2212 c(kvk2 )|2 \u03bc(dv) = 1 .\nB\n\nTherefore if\n\nf (v)Ez [e\u03c8(lc (v)+z\nB\n\nR\n\n\u221a\n\n1\u2212c(kvk2 ))\n\n]\u03bc(dv) = 0, then f (v) = 0 \u03bc-a.e. also.\n\nFunctions on M(B) that only depend on the support of the measure typically turn out\nto be invariant functions of the mapping in the sense of Definition 4.2. This simple fact can\nbe used to investigate the support of the sampling measures of stochastically stable ROSt's.\nHere we look at two examples below: the dimension of the support of the measure and\nwhether or not the support lies on a sphere. We will need three invariant functions of the\ncavity mapping.\nThe first two are\nn\no\nrmin(\u03bc) := inf 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1 : \u03bc{v \u2208 B : kvk \u2264 r} > 0 ;\nn\no\n(4.2)\nrmax (\u03bc) := sup 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1 : \u03bc{v \u2208 B : kvk \u2265 r} > 0 .\n\n27\n\n\fEssentially, rmin represents the inner radius of the support of \u03bc and rmax , the outer radius.\nThe requirements of Definition 4.2 are fulfilled by these two functions for any cavity mapping\n\u03a6\u03c8,lc . Indeed, both functions are measurable since\nn\no\n[\n\u03bc \u2208 M(B) : \u03bc{kvk \u2264 s\u2032 } > 0\n{\u03bc \u2208 M(B) : rmin (\u03bc) < s} =\ns\u2032 \u2208Q, 0\u2264s\u2032 <s\n\n{\u03bc \u2208 M(B) : rmax (\u03bc) > s} =\n\n[\n\ns\u2032 \u2208Q, s<s\u2032 \u22641\n\nn\no\n\u2032\n\u03bc \u2208 M(B) : \u03bc{kvk \u2265 s } > 0 ,\n\n(4.3)\n\nand the functions \u03bc 7\u2192 \u03bc{kvk \u2264 s\u2032 }, \u03bc 7\u2192 \u03bc{kvk \u2265 s\u2032 } are Borel measurable for the weak-*\ntopology on M(B). They are invariant under an isometry T of B since the norm of a vector\nis. The fact that rmin (\u03bc) = rmin(\u03a6\u03c8,lc \u03bc) and rmax (\u03bc) = rmax (\u03a6\u03c8,lc \u03bc) is direct from Lemma\n4.4, since the latter implies Pl -a.s.\n\u03bc{v \u2208 B : kvk \u2264 s} > 0 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03a6\u03c8,lc \u03bc{v \u2208 B : kvk \u2264 s} > 0\n\u03bc{v \u2208 B : kvk \u2265 s} > 0 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03a6\u03c8,lc \u03bc{v \u2208 B : kvk \u2265 s} > 0 .\nThe third invariant function we need is the dimension of the smallest subspace that\ncontains the support. One way to make this precise is as follows [1]. Let \u03bc \u2208 M(B). Define\n(weakly) the covariance operator C\u02c6\u03bc on H as\nZ\n\u2032 \u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nfor all v , v \u2208 H, v * (C\u02c6\u03bc v ) :=\n\u03bc(dv) (v \u2032 * v)(v * v \u2032\u2032 ) .\nB\n\nIt is easily checked that C\u02c6\u03bc is a self-adjoint, trace-class linear operator on H. (It is traceR\nP\nclass, since for a standard basis {ei } of H, T r C\u02c6\u03bc = i ei * (C\u02c6\u03bc ei ) = B \u03bc(dv)kvk2 \u2264 1.) In\nparticular, it is compact, thus admits a basis of orthonormal eigenvectors for H. We write\n{\u03bbi (\u03bc)} for the non-zero eigenvalues. We write H\u03bc for the eigenspace corresponding to the\nnon-zero eigenvalues. We have H = H\u03bc \u2295 H\u03bc\u22a5 . It is easily verified that \u03bc(H\u03bc\u22a5 \u2229 B) = 0. We\ndefine\ndim \u03bc := #{i \u2208 N : \u03bbi (\u03bc) > 0} = dim H\u03bc .\nWe claim that the function \u03bc 7\u2192 dim \u03bc is an invariant of the cavity mapping \u03a6\u03c8,lc for any \u03c8\nand c. Standard arguments show that it is measurable with respect to the Borel \u03c3-algebra of\nM(B). It is readily checked that eigenvectors of \u03bc are mapped to eigenvectors of \u03bcT \u22121 for any\nisometry T of B, therefore dim \u03bc = dim \u03bcT \u22121 . It remains to show that dim \u03bc = dim \u03a6\u03c8,lc \u03bc\nPl -a.s. We have v \u2208 H\u03bc\u22a5 \u2229 B if and only if\nZ\nv * (C\u02c6\u03bc v) =\n\u03bc(dv) (v, v)2 = 0 .\nB\n\nBy Lemma 4.4, this is true if and only if\nZ\n\u03a6\u03c8,lc \u03bc(dv) (v, v)2 = v * (C\u02c6\u03a6\u03c8,lc \u03bc v) = 0,\nB\n\n\u22a5\n\u2229 B. The claim follows.\nwhich in turn is equivalent to v \u2208 H\u03a6\n\u03c8,lc \u03bc\nThe following result on the dimension of stochastically stable ROSt is a generalization of\na result for competing particle systems which states that no system with a finite number of\nparticles can be quasi-stationary [28]. It is rather surprising that it holds for ROSt whose a\nlaw is invariant under a single cavity mapping.\n\n28\n\n\fTheorem 1.7. Let P be the law of a ROSt that is invariant under the cavity mapping \u03a6\u03bb,l\nfor a given \u03bb > 0. Let \u03bc be its sampling measure. Then\nP(dim \u03bc = 1 or dim \u03bc = \u221e) = 1 .\nIn other words, \u03bc is supported on a single vector or on an infinite-dimensional subset of B.\nProof. For simplicity, we set \u03bb = 1. By relying on the Choquet decomposition, it suffices\nto show the assertion holds when P is an extreme point of the set of laws invariant under\n\u03a61,l . Since \u03bc 7\u2192 dim \u03bc is an invariant function of the mapping, Lemma 4.3 implies that it is\nconstant with P-probability one. Suppose 1 < dim \u03bc < \u221e. We first prove that this implies\nthat the sampling measure \u03bc is supported on a sphere P-almost surely, that is, there exists\na deterministic r \u2265 0 such that \u03bc{v \u2208 B : kvk = r} = 1 for almost all \u03bc. Indeed, since\n\u03bc 7\u2192 rmin(\u03bc) defined in (4.3) is also an invariant function, it is constant P-a.s. This constant\nwill henceforth be written simply as rmin . For any r > rmin and \u01eb > 0, consider the ratio\n\u03bc{v \u2208 B : kvk > r + \u01eb}\n.\n\u03bc{v \u2208 B : kvk \u2264 r}\n\n(4.4)\n\nWe claim that the ratio is zero for any r > rmin and \u01eb > 0. If so, we are done, since it implies\nthat \u03bc{v \u2208 B : kvk > r} = 0 for any r > rmin , hence that \u03bc is supported on the sphere\nof radius rmin . By Lemma 2.4, P is invariant under the mappings \u03a6\u221aT ,l for any T \u2208 N.\nTherefore the ratio (4.4) has the same law as\n\u221a\n\nT\n\n2\n\ne T l(v)\u2212 2 kvk \u03bc(dv)\n{kvk>r+\u01eb}\n\u221a\n.\nR\nT l(v)\u2212 T2 kvk2\n\u03bc(dv)\ne\n{kvk\u2264r}\n\nR\n\nSince 1 < dim \u03bc < \u221e, l can be seen as a Gaussian vector in a finite-dimensional space. We\nthen have the bound \u2212klk \u2264 l(v) \u2264 klk, since kvk \u2264 1. A straightforward application of\nthat bound and simple estimates shows that the ratio is smaller or equal to\n\u221a\n\ne2\n\nT klk\u2212 T2 (2\u01ebr+\u01eb2 ) \u03bc{v\n\n\u2208 B : kvk > r + \u01eb}\n.\n\u03bc{v \u2208 B : kvk \u2264 r}\n\nThis proves the claim, since the above goes to zero as T \u2192 \u221e for Pl -almost all l.\nIt remains to show that if \u03bc has support in a finite-dimensional sphere, then it must be\nsupported on a single vector. The idea is that \u03bc must be supported on the vector where the\ncavity field is maximal. In a finite-dimensional space, v 7\u2192 l(v) is a continuous function for\nPl -almost all l. Since the sphere is compact, it achieves its maximum, say ml . Moreover,\nby independence of the l(v)'s in orthogonal directions, the maximizer, say vl\u2217 , is unique. Let\nCl (\u01eb) be a cap neighborhood of the maximizer vl\u2217 on the sphere such that l(v) > ml \u2212 \u01eb for\nv \u2208 Cl (\u01eb) and l(v) \u2264 ml \u2212 \u01eb for v \u2208 Cl (\u01eb)\u221ac . If the measure \u03bc is not supported on a single\nR\nvector, there exists an \u01eb such that Cl (\u01eb)c e T l(v) \u03bc(dv) > 0. We then have\nR\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\ne T l(v) \u03bc(dv)\n\u03bc{Cl (\u01eb/2)}\nCl (\u01eb/2)\n\u221a\n.\n\u2265 e T \u01eb/2\nR\nT\nl(v)\n\u03bc{Cl (\u01eb)c }\n\u03bc(dv)\ne\nCl (\u01eb)c\n\n29\n\n\fThis shows that, for any \u01eb, the limit of the left-hand side as T \u2192 \u221e exists and is infinite for\nP-almost all \u03bc and Pl -almost all l. But by invariance, the ratio on the left-hand side has the\nsame law under P \u00d7 Pl as for a single application of \u03a61,l , i.e.,\nR\nel(v) \u03bc(dv)\nCl (\u01eb/2)\nR\n.\nel(v) \u03bc(dv)\nCl (\u01eb)c\nThis ratio is infinite for all \u01eb if and only if\n\n(\u03a61,l \u03bc){vl\u2217 } = 1 P \u00d7 Pl -a.s.\nWe deduce by the invariance of the ROSt that \u03bc must be supported on a single vector.\nOne might expect that other properties of stochastically stable ROSt's might be obtained\nin a similar way leading to a better understanding of the hypotheses of the Ultrametricity\nConjecture. If stochastic stability is assumed for an infinite number of cavity fields, we can\nprove more.\nTheorem 1.8. Let P be the law of a ROSt that is invariant under the cavity mapping \u03a6\u03bb,lp\nfor a given \u03bb > 0 and for infinitely many p \u2208 N. Let \u03bc be its sampling measure and suppose\n2\nthat \u03bc\u22972 {(v, v \u2032) \u2208 B2 : v * v \u2032 = rmax\n(\u03bc)} > 0 on a set of positive P-probability. Then,\n\u03bc{v \u2208 B : kvk = rmax (\u03bc)} = 1 P-a.s.\nIn other words, \u03bc is almost surely supported on a sphere.\nProof. We set \u03bb = 1 for simplicity. In the proof, all p's refer to the infinite collection of p's\nfor which invariance holds. By relying again on the Choquet decomposition, it suffices to\nshow the assertion holds when P is an extreme point of the set of laws invariant under \u03a61,lp\nfor all p's. Consider rmin and rmax defined in (4.3). Since they are invariant functions of the\ncavity mappings \u03a61,lp for all p, they are constant P-a.s. We suppose that rmin < rmax and\nshow this leads to a contradiction.\nPick \u03b4 such that rmin < \u03b4 < rmax . Let B\u03b4 = {v \u2208 B : kvk < \u03b4}. Note that since\nrmin < rmax , we must have that 0 < \u03bc(B\u03b4 ) < 1 for P-almost all \u03bc.\nBy the invariance properties of the ROSt and Lemma 2.4, the following identity holds\nfor all T \u2208 N and all p's\n\uf8eeR\n\uf8f9\n\u221a\nT lp (v)\u2212 T2 kvk2p\ne\n\u03bc(dv)\nB\n\u0011 \uf8fb .\nE\u03bc(B\u03b4 ) = EEl \uf8f0 \u03b4 \u0010 \u221a\n(4.5)\nT lp (v)\u2212 T2 kvk2p\n\u03bc e\n\nNow pick a sequence (T (p))p such that T (p)\u03b4 2p \u2192 0.

This is demonstrated by the following example.\nTake p = (pi )i\u2208N a Poisson-Dirichlet variable with parameter x1 , and p\u2032 = (p\u2032j )j\u2208N a PoissonDirichlet variable with parameter x2 6= x1 . Pick q1 6= q2 strictly positive such that q1 + q2 = 1\nand\n(1 \u2212 x1 )q1 = (1 \u2212 x2 )q2 .\n(4.9)\nP\nP \u2032\nIt suffices to consider the ROSt with sampling measure \u03bc = i pi \u03b4ui + j pj \u03b4vj where\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(ui ) are orthogonal vectors of norm q1 and (vj ) are orthogonal vectors with norm q2 also\northogonal to the u's. A Poisson-Dirichlet variable with parameter x has the property that,\nfor any positive random variable W such that EW x < \u221e and for a iid sequence (Wi ) with\nthe law of W (see e.g. [5]),\nlaw\n(pi Wi ) = (E[W x ]1/x pi ) .\n32\n\n\fTherefore taking Wi = el(ui ) and Wj = el(vj ) , we have for the variables defined above and for\nthe cavity field l:\nq1\nq2\nlaw \u2212(1\u2212x1 )q1\nlaw \u2212(1\u2212x2 )q2 \u2032\n(pi el(ui )\u2212 2 ) = e 2\n(pi ) , and (p\u2032j el(vj )\u2212 2 ) = e 2\n(pj ) .\n\nThe relation (4.9) ensures that the constant is the same in both cases, hence vanishes after\nnormalization of the weights. This shows that the constructed \u03bc is stochastically stable\nThe above setup also provides a counterexample to the Ultrametricity Conjecture 1 if\nstochastic stability for a single cavity field alone holds. This is demonstrated by the following\nexample coming from the limit of two uncoupled\nas studied in [8]. It suffices to\nP REM's\n\u2032\nconsider the ROSt with sampling measure \u03bc = i,j pi pj \u03b4 \u221a1 (ui +vj ) . It is easily checked that\n2\nthis ROSt is stochastically stable from the invariance property of Poisson-Dirichlet variables\nand the fact that l( \u221a12 (ui + vj )) = \u221a12 l(ui ) + \u221a12 l(vj ) (the restriction (4.9) is not needed here).\nOn the other hand, the support of its sampling measure is not ultrametric as it can be easily\nchecked from the following triplet of vectors in the support of \u03bc: \u221a12 (u1 + v1 ), \u221a12 (u2 + v2 )\nand \u221a12 (u1 + v2 ).\n\nReferences\n[1] Aizenman M.
