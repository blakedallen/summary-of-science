We study these characteristics as functions of wall width and temperature. As the width\nincreases or the temperature decreases, direct tunneling between the majority spin bands reduces\nthe effectiveness of the diode. This has important implications for the zero-field quenched resistance\nof magnetic semiconductors and for the design of a recently proposed spin transistor.\nPACS numbers:\n\nIt has recently been reported that some doped semiconductors, such as Ga1\u2212x Mnx As [1] and Ti1\u2212x Cox O2\n[2], undergo ferromagnetic transitions at temperatures\nas high as 110 K and 300 K respectively, while others (ndoped Zn1\u2212x Mnx Se [3]) are almost completely spin polarized by the application of a relatively modest magnetic\nfield. These findings have raised hopes for the realization\nof semiconductor-based magnetoelectronic devices [4].\nIn a ferromagnetic semiconductor, the up- and downspin components of just one carrier type are quite analogous to majority and minority carriers in ordinary doped\nsemiconductors. Accordingly, a domain wall separating\ntwo ferromagnetic regions with opposite magnetizations\nis the analogue of a p-n junction, while two consecutive\ndomain walls correspond to a p-n-p transistor. In a recent paper [5] we have exploited this analogy to show that\nnonlinear amplification of a spin-polarized charge current\nis indeed possible in the \"p-n-p\" configuration, and can be\ncontrolled by a magnetic field or a voltage applied to the\n\"base\" region between the two domain walls. However,\nthe analysis of Ref. [5] was based on the assumption that\nthe probability of a carrier flipping its spin while crossing\nthe domain wall is negligible. This corresponds to assuming the resistivity of the domain wall is large compared\nto that of the bulk material.\nThe resistance of a domain wall between ferromagnetic\nmaterials has been examined several times from different perspectives since the pioneering work of Cabrera\nand Falicov [6]. These authors found that the resistance\nwas very small, and later calculations [7, 8] have supported that result for metallic magnets. A far different regime is possible, however, when the spin polarization is or approaches 100%. For example, experimental and theoretical results[9] indicate that domain walls\nin La0.7 Ca0.3 MnO3 may dominate the resistance in thin\nfilms. Magnetic semiconductor systems, due to their very\nsmall bandwidths, are also likely to be 100% spin polarized, and thus their domain walls should be highly resistive in the absence of spin-flip transport processes across\nthem.\nA key question that has not been addressed so far is\n\nhow the nonlinear current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of\nthe domain wall are affected by spin-flip processes as the\nwidth of the domain wall increases. Note that the width\nof a domain wall can now be directly measured [10] and,\nin principle, geometrically controlled [11]. Our analytical\ntheory of transport across the domain wall should therefore be useful in designing devices with optimal values\nof the controllable parameters. Certainly such a theory\nwould be crucial to understanding the zero-field quenched\nresistance and the low-field magnetoresistance of magnetic semiconductors as well as to the realization of the\n\"unipolar spin transistor\" proposed in [5].\nHere we present a quantitative study of the nonlinear I-V characteristics of a magnetic domain wall. The\nmain issue is the competition between minority spin injection, which is responsible for the nonlinear spin-diode\nbehavior, and majority spin transmission, which tends\nto suppress it. We shall show that the latter dominates\nwhen either the temperature is low, or the domain wall is\nthick. Assuming that the motion of carriers through the\ndomain wall is ballistic, we derive analytic expressions\nfor the charge and spin currents as functions of applied\nvoltage, width of the domain wall, and temperature. We\nfurther identify a new transport regime for intermediate\nwall thicknesses, in which carriers are ballistically transported across the domain wall (characterized by nonlinear charge currents), but most spin polarization is lost.\nOur model is schematically depicted in Fig. 1(a). The\ntwo ferromagnetic regions F 1 and F 2 are connected by\na domain wall region of width d, \u2212d/2 < x < d/2. The\nexchange field B(x) has the form\n~\nB(x)\n= B0 [cos \u03b8(x)x\u0302 + sin \u03b8(x)\u0177],\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x\u0302, \u0177 are unit vectors in the direction of x and y,\nand the angle \u03b8(x) varies linearly from \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 in F 2 to\n\u03b8 = \u2212\u03c0/2 in F 1 [12].\nWe assume that d, while possibly large in comparison\nto a typical carrier wavelength, is smaller than the mean\nfree path and the spin diffusion length Ls , which is in\nturn smaller than the geometric size of the system.

(b)\nQualitative behavior of the quasichemical potentials and the\nelectrostatic potential (solid line). Note that the nonequilibrium voltage drop occurs within the interfacial region, while\nthe nonequilibrium populations extend up to a distance of order Ls from it. (c) Reflection and transmission processes for\nan electron incident on the domain wall.\n\nis to calculate the voltage V that develops across the\ndomain wall and the spin current Js due to the flow.\nLet \u03bc> and \u03bc< be the quasi-chemical potentials, which\ncontrol the nonequilibrium densities of majority and minority spin carriers respectively [13]. Far from the wall\nwe have \u03bc> = \u03bc< and the carrier densities have the equi(0)\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\nlibrium values n> and n< , with n> >> n< . Density\n(0)\nvariations from equilibrium \u2206n>(<) \u2261 n>(<) \u2212 n>(<) are\nrelated to the difference of the quasichemical potentials\n\u2206\u03bc \u2261 \u03bc< \u2212 \u03bc> near the domain wall. Since, by charge\nneutrality, \u2206n< \u2243 \u2212\u2206n> we see that the relative change\nin the minority spin density is always much larger than\nthe corresponding relative change in the majority spin\ndensity. This implies that \u03bc> is essentially pinned to\nits bulk value, while \u03bc< varies significantly in a region\nof length \u223c Ls on either side of the domain wall. We\ncan therefore set \u03bc> \u2243 0 throughout F 1 and \u03bc> \u2243 eV\nthroughout F 2, where V is the electrostatic potential of\nF 1 relative to F 2 (see Fig. 1(b)) and the carriers are\nassumed to be electrons. The density variations are\nh\ni\n(0)\n(2)\n\u2206n< (x) = n< e\u2206\u03bc(x)/kB T \u2212 1 ,\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.\nThe charge currents for majority and minority spin\norientations must satisfy the condition J> + J< = Jq\nwhere the total charge current Jq is independent of position. In addition, the minority carrier current J< is\nalmost entirely a diffusion current, and is given by the\nclassical relation J< (x) = eDdn< (x)/dx, where D is\nthe diffusion constant. Because the spin density relaxes to equilibrium exponentially on the scale of Ls (\n\n\u2206\u03bc(\u00b1d/2) = \u2213eV.\n\n(4)\n\nUnder the same assumption of nondegeneracy, it will\nalso be shown that the matching condition for the spin\ncurrent Js (x) \u2261 J\u2191 (x) \u2212 J\u2193 (x) is\nJs (\u2212d/2)\nt\u0304\u2212 + t\u0304+ e\u2212eV /kB T\n=\nJs (d/2)\nt\u0304+ + t\u0304\u2212 e\u2212eV /kB T\n\n(5)\n\nwhere t\u0304\u00b1 = t\u0304nf \u00b1 t\u0304sf , and t\u0304sf and t\u0304nf are populationaveraged transmission coefficients, with and without spin\nflip (see Fig. 1(c)), which will be defined more precisely\nbelow. Thus, the spin current is conserved across a sharp\ndomain wall (t\u0304+ = t\u0304\u2212 ), but reverses its sign across a\nsmooth one (t\u0304+ = \u2212t\u0304\u2212 ).\nCombining Eqs. (3-5), and using current conservation\nwe arrive at our main results.

For t\u0304sf = 0 this reduces to\nthe equation [14] derived in ([5]), while for t\u0304nf = 0 we\nget V = 0 as expected for a ballistic conductor. In the\nlinear regime eV /kB T << 1 this formula leads to the\nwell-known interfacial resistance of Fert and Valet [15].\nSecond, in the immediate vicinity of the domain wall the\nspin current is given by\n\u0013\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0012\nt\u0304sf\neV\neV\nJs\n1\u00b1\n, (7)\n= 2 sinh2\ntanh\nJ0\n2kB T\n2kB T\nt\u0304nf\nwhere the upper sign holds in F 2 and the lower sign in\nF 1. We see that spin-flip processes cause the appearance of an odd-in-voltage component of the spin-current,\nwhereas, for tsf = 0, the spin-current is an even function of V [5]. Shown in Fig. 2 is (a) the spin current\nin F 1, (b) the charge current, and (c) the ratio of the\ntwo. The curves correspond to several different values\nof t\u0304nf /t\u0304sf .

The\nspin current in F 2 is related to that in F 1 according to\nthe following relation: Js (F 2; V ) = \u2212Js (F 1; \u2212V ). As\nt\u0304nf /t\u0304sf becomes smaller, the \"leakage current\" between\nthe two majority bands becomes significant, and the odd\nin V term in the spin current begins to dominate. Over\nthe entire range shown of t\u0304nf /t\u0304sf the relationship between Jq and V is highly nonlinear indicating ballistic\ntransport. Thus ballistic transport itself is not a sufficient\ncondition for maintaining spin polarization in transport\nacross a domain wall.\nAssuming ballistic transport in the wall region, we calculate the transmission/reflection coefficients from the\nexact numerical solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\u0014 2 2\n\u0013\u0015 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2212~ \u2202\n\u2206\n\u03c8\u2191\n\u03c8\u2191\n0\ne\u2212i\u03b8(x)\n=E\n,\n\u2212\n\u03c8\u2193\n\u03c8\u2193\n0\n2m \u2202x2\n2 e+i\u03b8(x)\n(8)\nwhere \u2206 = g\u03bcB B is the exchange spin-splitting.

Recent experiments\n[10] suggest the width of domain walls in artificial nanostructures can be as small as 1 nm, giving \u03be \u223c 1 for an\neffective mass m equal to the electron mass and a spin\nsplitting \u2206 = 100meV . Domain walls thinner than 20 nm\nhave already been inferred in thin GaMnAs layers[16].\nFig. 3(d)-(f) shows the behavior of the key ratio\nt\u0304nf /t\u0304sf as a function of temperature and thickness. As\nexpected t\u0304nf vanishes at low temperature, because, in\nthis limit, there are no incident states above the exchange\nbarrier to provide minority spin-injection. The spin diode\nis a thermally-activated device (as a p-n diode is), thus\nhigher temperature is favorable to its performance.

However the condition kB T . \u2206 must be respected if the system is to\nbe nearly 100% spin-polarized. The conclusion is that\nthere is a range Tmin < T < Tmax in which unipolar spin\ndiodes and transistors are expected to be operational.\nWe now come to the justification of the matching condition (5) and the calculation of the quasi-chemical potential offset. We begin with the former. In the spirit of\nthe Landauer-B\u00fcttiker formalism we treat the ferromagnetic regions F 1 and F 2 as two reservoirs of spin polarized electrons at chemical potentials \u03bc1 = 0 and \u03bc2 = eV\nwhich inject up- and down-spin electrons, respectively,\nin the domain wall region. The small density of minority\nspin carriers is neglected in the following argument. The\ncomponents of the current due to electrons with energies\nin the range (E, E + dE) on the two sides of the domain\nwall are given (in units of e/h) by\nj1> (E)\nj1< (E)\nj2> (E)\nj2< (E)\n\n= \u2212(1 \u2212 rnf (E))f1> (E) + tsf (E)f2> (E)\n= rsf (E)f1> (E) + tnf (E)f2> (E)\n= (1 \u2212 rnf (E))f2> (E) \u2212 tsf (E)f1> (E)\n= \u2212 rsf (E)f2> (E) \u2212 tnf (E)f1> (E),\n(9)\n\nwhere rnf and rsf are the non spin-flip and spin-flip reflection probabilities, related to tnf and tsf by the unitarity condition rnf + rsf + tnf + tsf = 1, and f1> ,f2>\nare shorthands for the equilibrium distributions of majority spin carriers in F 1 and F 2 respectively. Note\nthat, for nondegenerate carriers f1> = f2> e\u2212eV /kB T .\nWe find that the spin-flip reflection coefficient rsf is extremely small at all energies and thicknesses, and can\n\n\f4\ntherefore be safely neglected. With this approximation, combined with the unitarity condition, it is easy\nto show that the energy-resolved currents are given by\njs1(2) (E) = (t\u2212(+) (E) + t+(\u2212) (E)e\u2212eV /kB T )f2> (E). Noting that f2> (E) \u221d e\u2212E/kB T and integrating\nover energy\nR\u221e\nwe see that the total current Js1 = 0 js1 (E)e\u2212e/kB T is\nequal to A(t\u0304\u2212 + t\u0304+ e\u2212eV /kB T ) where the average transmission coefficients are defined as\nR\u221e\ntnf (sf ) (E)e\u2212E/kB T dE\nt\u0304nf (sf ) = 0 R \u221e \u2212E/k T\n,\n(10)\nB dE\n0 e\nand A is a constant. Similarly Js2 = A(t\u0304+ + t\u0304\u2212 e\u2212eV /kB T ).\nThe ratio Js1 /Js2 is thus given by Eq. (5).\nTo justify the quasi-chemical potential offset condition, Eq. (4) we notice that the quasi-chemical potential\n\u03bc<,1 of minority spin electrons near the left hand side\nof the domain wall is an average of the quasi-chemical\npotentials of right (+) and left (-) moving electrons :\n+\n\u2212\ne\u03bc<,1 /kB T = [e\u03bc<,1 /kB T + e\u03bc<,1 /kB T ]/2. (A similar relation holds for the quasi-chemical potential \u03bc<,2 of minority spin electrons near the right hand side of the domain\nwall).

The first of these equations, for\nexample, says that the density of right-moving up-spin\nelectrons of energy E on the right hand side of the domain\nwall is equal to the density of right-moving down-spin\nelectrons of the same energy which enter from the left\nand flip their spin, plus the density of right-moving upspin electrons which enter from the left and do not flip\ntheir spin. Because the quasi-chemical potentials of the\nmajority spin carriers are essentially pinned to their bulk\n\u2212\n+\nvalues, we can set \u03bc+\n>,2 = \u03bc>,2 = \u03bc>,2 = eV and \u03bc>,1 =\n\u03bc\u2212\n>,1 = \u03bc>,1 = 0. Integrating Eqs. (11) over energy, and\nmaking use of p + q = 1, we easily get \u03bc<,1 = eV and\n\u03bc<,2 = 0, as indicated in Fig. 1(b).\nIn summary, we have shown that both the thickness\nand the temperature have a profound influence on the\nnonlinear transport properties of a ferromagnetic domain\nwall. We have derived analytical formulas, Eqs. (6) and\n(7), for the charge and spin currents of this \"magnetic\njunction\" under physical assumptions similar to the ones\nfrom which the Shockley equations of a classical p-n junction are derived. These formulae indicate a new transport\nregime, where charge transport is ballistic, but spin polarization is lost. Equations (6) and (7), together with\nmicroscopic calculation of the population-averaged transmission coefficients, can be used to assess the effectiveness of unipolar spin-diode devices in realistic circumstances.\nWe gratefully acknowledge support from NSF grants\nNo. DMR-0074959 and from DARPA/ARO DAAD1901-1-0490.\n\n[13]\n\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n\n~\nfilm in the x-y plane.

However, the\nrelative phase of the up and down components of the\nwave function has a rapid spatial variation - typically\non the scale of the electronic wavelength \u03bb. Therefore\ntransverse spin coherence disappears on a scale larger\nthan \u03bb, and the carriers' spin can be safely assumed to be\neither parallel or antiparallel to the local magnetization.\nB. G.
