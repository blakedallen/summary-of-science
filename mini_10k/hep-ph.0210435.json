We find that this interaction can induce new sizeable SU(3)\nand U(3) nonet breaking effects in KL \u2212 \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 transitions and therefore in\nKL \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 due to large matrix elements of h\u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 )|\u03b1s Ga\u03bc\u03bd G\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\na |0i from QCD\nanomaly. These new effects play an important role in explaining the observed\nvalue. We also study the effects of this interaction on the contribution to\n\u2206mKL \u2212KS .\nPACS numbers: 11.30.Hv, 13.25.Es, 14.40.AQ\n\nTypeset using REVTEX\n1\n\n\fIt is well known that contributions from intermediate hadronic state effect play an important role in many low energy processes. Some of the notable examples are KL \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 [1,2]\nand \u2206mK = mKL \u2212 mKS [3\u20137]. For KL \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, the direct contribution due to quark level\ns \u2192 d\u03b3\u03b3 alone accounts for only a small portion of the amplitude measured experimentally\n[2,7]. For \u2206mK , the direct contribution due to \u2206S = 2 four quark operator is again only\na fraction of the experimental value depending on the value of the bag factor BK [3,4]. A\nsimple method to estimate the contributions from intermediate hadronic states is the pole\ndominance approximation in which one assumes that a few low lying resonances saturate\nthe contribution. The commonly identified resonances in the above two cases are \u03c0 0 , \u03b7\nand \u03b7 \u2032 . Combining with U(3) flavor symmetry, the KL \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 amplitude can be estimated\n[2,6]. If U(3) nonet is a good symmetry, the calculations are straightforward. However,\nnot only nonet but also SU(3) are known to be broken, there are large uncertainties in\nthese calculations. One should also study that if there are some new contributions in the\nStandard Model (SM) which have not been examined so far. In this paper we show that\nindeed there is a new contribution to to KL \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and \u2206mK . This new contribution comes\nfrom s \u2192 d + 2gluon induced K \u2212 \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032) transition, and the intermediate \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032) subsequently\ndecay into \u03b3\u03b3 or change to another neutral kaon through the usual \u2206s = 1 interaction. We\nfind that, because of the large QCD anomaly hadronic matrix element h\u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 )|\u03b1s Ga\u03bc\u03bd G\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\na |0i\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 a\nG\u03b1\u03b2 ), the new contributions are sizeable and also induce new sizeable SU(3)\n(G\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\na = \u01eb\n\nand U(3) breaking effects.\nThe decay amplitude Adir of the direct contribution to KL \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 from quark level\ninteraction s \u2192 d\u03b3\u03b3 in the SM has been studied before [1,2,7]. Here we improve the\ncalculations by including QCD corrections which also serve to set up our notations. In the\nSM, s \u2192 d\u03b3\u03b3 can be generated at one loop level by exchanging a W boson and quarks with\ntwo photons emitted from particles in the loop and particles in the external legs. The QCD\ncorrected effective Hamiltonian for s \u2192 d\u03b3\u03b3 is given by\n\u03b3\u03b3\n+ MR\u03b3\u03b3 ,\nHef f (s \u2192 d\u03b3\u03b3) = MIR\n\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\f\u03b3\u03b3\nwhere MIR\nis the irreducible contribution with the two photons emitted from particles in the\n\nloop.

We have also estimated \u03be by calculating the quantity < 0|\u03bad(1\nusing perturbative QCD method and appropriate distribution amplitude of quarks in the\nkaon [11]. This approach also obtains a value of order one for \u03be. One should be aware that\nthe applicability of pQCD may not be a good one here. However, we find that contribution\nrelated to \u03be is not important as long as \u03be is of order one. That is, the precise value of \u03be is\nnot important here and we will use \u03be to be one in our later discussions.\nTo estimate the irreducible contribution, one needs to know the quantity a2 = c1 + c2/N.\nWithout QCD corrections, c1 = 0 and c2 = 1. This gives a a2 = 1/3. With QCD corrections\nthe value for a2 will be altered. The leading and next-leading order corrections to ci have\nbeen calculated [9]. The values of ci depend on the renormalization scale \u03bc. Since one\ndoes not know precisely where is the matching scale \u03bc, this causes uncertainty in a2 . For\nexample at the leading order, a2 = \u22120.27 at \u03bc \u2248 1 GeV, while at \u03bc = 1.3 GeV, a2 = \u22120.17\nwith \u039bM S = 325 MeV. At the next leading order the dependences on \u03bc for each of the c1\n4\n\n\fand c2 are reduced, but leaves a2 still sensitive to \u03bc. For example, in the NDR scheme,\nfor \u039bM S = 325 MeV, a2 is -0.08 and -0.1 at \u03bc = 1.0 GeV and \u03bc = 1.3 GeV, respectively.\nAllowing the QCD parameter \u039bM S to vary within the allowed range 215 \u223c 435 MeV, a2\ncan vary in the range \u22120.1 \u223c \u22120.35 depending whether NDR or HV scheme is used [9].\nThat is, the value of a2 is not well determined even from the next leading order perturbative\ncalculations. When all effects, perturbative and non-perturbative, are correctly treated, the\nfinal physical observables will not depend on the renormalization scale \u03bc. Unfortunately,\nsuch a calculation is not possible at present. The parameter a2 behaves similarly to the\none in hadronic B and D decays. In both D and B decays, the parameter a2 determined\nfrom data (|a2 | \u223c (0.2 \u223c 0.5)) is very different from factorization value by inserting c1,2\nat relevant scale in the expression for a2 [12]. One would expect similar thing happens in\nkaon decays although the details may be different. To take into account uncertainties in\ntheoretical calculations of a2 , we will treat it as a free parameter and allow it to vary in the\nrange of \u22120.5 \u223c 0.5. One can also turn the argument around to obtain information about\na2 from KL \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 data.\nFor \u03be of order one, and a2 in the range of \u22120.5 \u223c 0.5, we find that the dominant direct\nK\u0304 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 amplitude is from the irreducible contribution. We have\n1\nAdir (KL \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) = i\u00c3dir F\u03bc\u03bd F\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\n8\u03b1em GF\n\u2217\nfK Na2 Re(Vud\nVus ).\n\u00c3dir =\n9\u03c0\n\n(8)\n\nUsing Vud = 0.9735 and Vus = 0.2196 and fK = 1.27f\u03c0 [13], we obtain,\n\u00c3dir = 2.54 \u00d7 10\u221212 a2 MeV\u22121 .\n\n(9)\n\nFor |a2 | = 0.5, it is only about 35% of the experimental value of 3.5 \u00d7 10\u221212 MeV\u22121 [13].\nWithout QCD corrections a2 = 1/3, \u00c3dir is about 24% of the total amplitude. There must\nbe some other contributions to this process. These effects may come from contributions\nwith intermediate hadronic states or even contributions from new physics beyond the SM.\nIf one has a good understanding of all SM contributions, one can have a detailed study of\n5\n\n\fnew physics beyond the SM. It is probably too early to say that new physics is needed here\ndue to large uncertainties in possible hadronic intermediate contributions. Therefore we will\nwork within the SM and see how contribution from hadronic intermediate states can affect\nthe results.\nSeveral analyses have been carried out using pole model with \u03c0 0 , \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 poles to\ncalculate the hadronic intermediate contribution. In this model, the amplitude Ahad from\nexchange of intermediate hadronic states is given by [6]\nh\u03c0 0 |HW |KL i\nm2K \u2212 m2\u03c0\n\"\nm2 \u2212 m2\u03c0 \u00c3(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3)\n\u00d7 1+ K\nm2K \u2212 m2\u03b7 \u00c3(\u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3)\n\n\u00c3had = \u00c3(\u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3)\n\n+\n\nm2K \u2212 m2\u03c0 \u00c3(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3)\nm2K \u2212 m2\u03b7\u2032 \u00c3(\u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3)\n\n\u221a\n!\n1+\u03b4\n2 2\n\u221a cos \u03b8 + \u221a \u03c1 sin \u03b8\n3\n3\n\u221a\n!#\n2 2\n1+\u03b4\n\u221a sin \u03b8 \u2212 \u221a \u03c1 cos \u03b8 ,\n3\n3\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle, \u03b4 is the SU(3) breaking parameter [6]. The parameter \u03c1\nparameterizes U(3) nonet breaking effect and is defined as\ns\n\n\u03c1=\u2212\n\n3 < \u03b71 |HW |K 0 >\n.\n8 < \u03c0 0 |HW |K 0 >\n\n(11)\n\nIn the nonet limit \u03c1 = 1. Chiral Lagrangian analysis gives h\u03c0 0 |HW |KL i = 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22127 m2K [6].\nUsing experimental values for \u03c0 0 , \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, \u00c3had can be estimated.\nThe above contributions can be viewed as obtained by Ahad =\n\nP\n\ni h\u03b3\u03b3|iihi|H\u0303ef f (\u2206S\n\n=\n\n\u22121)|KL i with i = \u03c0 0 , \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 in the pole model approximation. Here H\u0303ef f (\u2206S = \u22121) is the\nfull \u2206S = \u22121 effective Lagrangian with O7\u03b3 term removed since it has been counted as the\ncontribution to Adir . Therefore Adir and Ahad are contributions from different sources. In\nprevious calculations the contributions for Ahad from O8G were not considered [2,6]. We now\nstudy in detail the effect of this interaction on KL \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3.\nAt the quark-gluon level, O8G induces s \u2192 d + gg. To obtain Ahad , one needs to estimate\nthe contribution from s \u2192 d+gg to K\u0304 0 \u2212\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 through gg \u2192 \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032. The effective Hamiltonian\ngg\n \u0304 bi-spinor product, can be obtained by some simple\nMIR,R\nfor s \u2192 dgg, with color singlet ds\n\u03b3\u03b3\ngg\nreplacements from MIR,R\n. To obtain MIR,R\none first replaces the photon polarization vectors\n\n6\n\n\f\u01eb\u03bc (k1 )\u01eb\u03bd (k2 ) by the gluon polarization vector \u01eb\u03bca (k1 )\u01eb\u03bda (k2 ) with the color index a summed\ngg\nover. Then one replaces \u03b1em by \u03b1s (9/4)/(2N) and \u03b1em ci12 by \u03b1s ci8G /(2N) for MIR\nand MRgg ,\n\nrespectively [7]. The factor 1/(2N) comes from picking up the color singlet part.\nSimilar to the procedure in obtaining the amplitude Adir for KL \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, one can obtain\nthe amplitude for KL \u2192 gg. We find that with \u03be of order one, a2 in the range of \u22120.5 \u223c 0.5\nand ct8G \u2248 \u22120.15 as given in the SM, the irreducible contribution, again, dominates the\namplitude.

Because the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing and the different quark\nmasses, both U(3) nonet and SU(3) symmetries are broken.

There are several parameters\ninvolved in \u00c3had , the mixing angle \u03b8, the decay constants f1,8 , the SU(3) and U(3) nonet\nbreaking parameters \u03b4 and \u03c1, and the parameter a2 . Chiral perturbation calculations and\nfitting data not involving KL \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 have obtained \u03b8 \u2248 \u221220\u25e6 , \u03b4 \u2248 0.17, f8 \u2248 1.28f\u03c0\nand f1 \u2248 1.10f\u03c0 [15]. We will use these values for these parameters in the calculation of\nKL \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3. There is not a reliable estimate for the parameter \u03c1. Since we are interested to\nsee how the new s \u2192 dgg interaction induces U(3) nonet breaking effect, we will take \u03c1 = 1\nand attribute nonet breaking solely to r gg . As have been discussed s \u2192 dgg also induce\nSU(3) breaking effect. This effect was not included in other fittings. We therefore should\ninclude this new SU(3) breaking effect also.\nWithout the s \u2192 dgg effect, we find that the amplitude \u00c3total is equal to 5.5(1+0.46a2)\u00d7\n10\u221212 MeV\u22121 which is considerably larger than the experimental value 3.5 \u00d7 10\u221212 MeV\u22121\n[13] for |a2 | < 0.5. With the new effect, we find\n8\n\n\f\u00c3total = 5.5(1 + 2.14a2 ) \u00d7 10\u221212 MeV\u22121 .\n\n(19)\n\nTo reproduce the central experimental value, a2 is required to be \u22120.17 which is a reasonable\nvalue to have.\nThe detailed numerical results depend on several parameters. Even with other parameters fixed, one can introduce also a phase to a2 . To fit the KL \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 data, the values for the\nmagnitude and phase of a2 can vary. We, however, would like to emphasize that the new\neffect discussed can play an important role in KL \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 independent of the details.\nThe new contributions for KL \u2212 \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032) transitions also induce new hadronic intermediate\nstate effect to the KL and KS mass difference parameter Re(M12 ) in the pole dominance\napproximation.

With the new effects\nand a2 = \u22120.17 as determined from KL \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, the contribution to \u2206mK is \u22120.9 \u00d7 10\u221212\nMeV, and again it can not be neglected. The new effect in KL \u2192 \u03c0 0 , \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 transitions can\nhave sizeable contribution to \u2206mK .\nThe s \u2192 dgg process can also induce KL -glueball mixing, which would also affect KL \u2192\n\u03b3\u03b3 and \u2206mS\u2212L , as pointed out in Ref. [7] where a light glueball mass 1.4 GeV was used.\nRecent lattice calculations indicate that the pseudo-scalar glueball mass is about 2.3 GeV\n[16]. With such a large mass the glueball-\u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 ) mixing contribution should be small and\ntherefore the effects are smaller than effects discussed earlier.\nIn conclusion we have evaluated additional contributions to KL \u2192 \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 ) transitions from\ns \u2192 dgg in the Standard Model. These transitions induce new sizeable SU(3) and U(3)\nbreaking effects and have significant effects on contributions to KL \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and \u2206mK .\n9\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nThe work of XGH was supported in part by National Science Council under grants NSC\n91-2112-M-002-42, and in part by the Ministry of Education Academic Excellence Project\n89-N-FA01-1-4-3.
