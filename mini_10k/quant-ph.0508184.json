This\nHamiltonian was studied some time ago [1] as a simple\nmodel of decoherence. It was used to show that relatively straightforward assumptions about the dynamics\ncan lead to the emergence of a preferred set of pointer\nstates due to environment\u2013induced superselection (einselection) [1, 2]. Such models have gained additional importance in the past decade because of their relevance to\nquantum information processing [3].\nThe model described by (1) was particularly useful to\nilustrate the nature of decoherence in the context of a\nmeasurement. In such case the central spin is used as a\nsimple (two state - one bit) approximation for a memory of classical apparatus. Then, it is natural to neglect\nthe effect of the system's self\u2013Hamiltonian. As a consequence, the eigenstates of the interaction Hamiltonian (1)\nemerge as preferred pointer states of the system (defined\nas the ones which are \"least perturbed\" by the interaction with the environment [2]). Thus, the eigenstates of\nthe \u03c3z operator (denoted here as |0i and |1i, with eigenvalues +1 and \u22121 respectively) are dynamically selected\nby the interaction with the environment. Indeed, these\nstates are not perturbed by the interaction while other\nsuperpositions rapidly decay into their mixtures.\nNeglecting the self\u2013Hamiltonian of the system is not always a reasonable approximation. Studies of decoherence\nwithout such assumption have also been carried out using, mostly, the Quantum Brownian Motion as a paradig-\n\nmatic example [4]. In such case, pointer states do not\ncoincide with the eigenstates of the interaction Hamiltonian but can range from coherent states for the QBM case\n[5] to eigenstates of the system's Hamiltonian [6]. Their\nproperties are determined by the interplay between the\nself\u2013Hamiltonian and the interaction with the environment.\nIn this paper we will study a generalization of the\nabove simple model described by the Hamiltonian\nN\n\nX\n1\ngk \u03c3z(k) .\nHT = \u2206\u03c3x + \u03c3z \u2297\n2\n\n(2)\n\nk=1\n\nThis simple model includes both the effect of the evolution of the central system and its coupling with the spin\nenvironment.\nThe purpose of our study is twofold. First, in Section\nII we will analyze again the case where the central spin\nhas no self\u2013Hamiltonian (\u2206 = 0 above). Our goal is to\nshow that \u2013 with a few additional natural and simple assumptions about the distribution of coupling strengths\ngk \u2013 one can evaluate the exact time dependence of the\nreduced density matrix of the central spin. In fact, we\nwill demonstrate that the off\u2013diagonal components display a Gaussian (rather than exponential) decay. In this\nway we will exhibit a simple soluble example of a situation where the usual Markovian [7] assumptions about\nthe evolution of a quantum open system are not satisfied\nat any time.\nThen, in Section III we will consider the more complex\ncase with non-trivial dynamics (\u2206 6= 0 above). We will\nshow that, under the same natural assumptions made in\nSection II about the distribution of coupling strengths\nin the interaction Hamiltonian, the problem can also be\nsolved exactly. The solution will enable us to study two\nvery important features of the decoherence process. We\nwill analyze the nature of pointer states and also the\nway in which the reduced density matrix of the central\nspin evolves in time. In this case, the decay of the off\u2013\ndiagonal component is not Gaussian but displays long\n\n\f2\ntime algebraic tails which we obtain analytically. The\nmost probable pointer states will be shown to range from\neigenstates of \u03c3z in the small \u2206 limit to eigenstates of\n\u03c3x in the opposite limit of large \u2206 (result that can be\nexpected based on the considerations presented in [6]).\nIn Section IV we will summarize our results which, apart\nfrom their implications for decoherence, could also be\nrelevant to quantum error correction [8] where precise\nknowledge of decoherence is essential to select an efficient\nstrategy to defeat it.\nII.\n\nSTATIC SYSTEM - GAUSSIAN\nDECOHERENCE\n\nHere we will consider the system described by Eq. (1).\nWe begin by outlining how to solve this model exactly,\nand how to find the time dependence of the elements of\nthe reduced density matrix of the system. Let us consider\nan initial state for the combined system\u2013environment of\nthe form\n|\u03a8SE (0)i = (a |0i + b |1i)\n\nN\n2X\n\u22121\n\nn=0\n\ncn |ni .\n\n(3)\n\nHere |ni are the states of the computational basis of the\nenvironment that diagonalizes HSE . The k-th digit of the\nbinary form of n, nk , represents the state up or down in\nthe Z axis of the k-th spin of the environment. The main\nassumptions above are that the initial state is a product\n(no initial entanglement between the system and environment) and that the total state is pure. Both conditions\ncan be easily relaxed, but choosing Eq. (3) simplifies the\npresentation. The state of SE at an arbitrary time is\ngiven by:\n|\u03a8SE (t)i = a |0i |E0 (t)i + b |1i |E1 (t)i ,\n\n(4)\n\nwith\n|E0 (t)i =\n\nN\n2X\n\u22121\n\nn=0\n\ncn e\u2212iBn t/2 |ni\n\n= |E1 (\u2212t)i ,\n\n(5)\n\nand where\nBn =\n\nN\nX\n\n(\u22121)nk gk\n\n(6)\n\nk=1\n\nThe reduced density matrix of the system is then:\n\u03c1S = TrE |\u03a8SE (t)i h\u03a8SE (t)|\n= |a|2 |0i h0| + ab\u2217 r(t) |0i h1|\n+ a\u2217 br\u2217 (t) |1i h0| + |b|2 |1i h1| ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the decoherence factor r(t) = hE1 (t)|E0 (t)i can be\nreadily obtained:\nr(t) =\n\nN\n2X\n\u22121\n\nn=0\n\n2\n\n|cn | e\u2212iBn t .\n\n(8)\n\nIt was shown in [1] (using some simplifications to be\ndiscussed below) that for t > 0, r(t) decays rapidly to\nzero, so that the typical fluctuations of the off-diagonal\nterms of \u03c1S will be small for large environments. Therefore, the decoherence factor tends to zero |r(t)|2 \u2212\u2192\nN \u2192\u221e\n\n0, leaving \u03c1S approximately diagonal in a mixture of the\npointer states {|0i , |1i} which retain preexisting classical\ncorrelations.\nWe will show in this section that, for a fairly generic set\nof assumptions, the form of r(t) can be further evaluated\nand that \u2013 quite universally \u2013 it turns out to be approximately Gaussian in time. To prove this we will only\nrequire that the couplings gk of Eq. (1) are sufficiently\nconcentrated near their average value so that their standard deviation (gk \u2212 hgk i)2 exists and is finite. When\nthis condition is not fulfilled other sorts of time dependence become possible. In particular, r(t) may be exponential when the distribution of couplings is, for example,\nLorentzian.\nTo obtain our result we rewrite Eq. (8) as\nZ\nr(t) = e\u2212iBt \u03b7(B)dB,\n(9)\nthat is, the decoherence factor is the Fourier transform\nof a characteristic function\n\u03b7(B) =\n\nN\n2X\n\u22121\n\nn=0\n\n2\n\n|cn | \u03b4(B \u2212 Bn ).\n\n(10)\n\nEq. (10) is a particular case of the more general strength\nfunction or local density of states [9],\nX\n\u03b7(B) =\n| h\u03c6\u03bb |\u03a8SE i |2 \u03b4(B \u2212 B\u03bb ),\n(11)\n\u03bb\n\nwhere |\u03c6\u03bb i are the eigenfunctions of the full Hamiltonian\nwith eigenenergies B\u03bb .\nThe discussion of decoherence in our model is thus directly related to the study of the characteristic function of\nthe distribution of coupling energies \u03b7(B). Since the Bn 's\nare sums of gk 's (that we assume independent of each\nother), equation (9) makes r(t) itself a product of characteristic functions of the distributions of the couplings gk .\nThus, the distribution of Bn belongs to the class of the\nso\u2013called infinitely divisible distributions [10, 11]. The\nbehavior of the decoherence factor r(t) \u2013 characteristic\nfunction of an infinitely divisible distribution \u2013 depends\nonly on the average and variance of the distributions of\ncouplings weighted by the initial state of the environment\n[10, 11].\nAssuming that the variance of the couplings gk is finite, we claim that for reasonable assumptions on the\ninitial state of the environment (the coefficients cn ), and\nN sufficiently large, \u03b7(B) has in general a Gaussian form.\nTherefore, the decoherence factor decays as a Gaussian\nwith time. We will show this behavior with some examples where an exact solution is possible, and discuss the\nregime of validity of the conjecture.\n\n\f3\nLet us consider first the simplest case where all couplings are equal, gk = g, and all the spins of the environment have the same initial state,\nN\nO\nk=1\n\n(\u03b1k |0ik + \u03b2k |1ik ),\n\nwith \u03b1k = \u03b1 and \u03b2k = \u03b2 for all k. The decoherence factor\nthen takes the simple form r(t) = (|\u03b1|2 eigt +|\u03b2|2 e\u2212igt )N .\nExpanding this expression we obtain\nN \u0012 \u0013\nX\nN\nr(t) =\n|\u03b1|2k |\u03b2|2(N \u2212k)| exp [\u2212igt(2k \u2212 N )].\nk\nk=0\n(13)\nAs follows from the Laplace-de Moivre theorem [10], for\nsufficiently large N the coefficients of the binomial expansion of Eq.

The contribution\nof the k\u2013th spin of the environment to the random energy is +g or \u2212g with probability |\u03b1|2 or |\u03b2|2 respectively\n[Fig. (1.a)]. Therefore, the set of all the resulting energies\nmust have an (approximately) Gaussian distribution.\nWe can carry out the same argument in the more general case of Eq. (12) for different couplings and initial\nstates for the spins of the environment. Here,\nr(t) =\n\nN\nY\n\nk=1\n\n(|\u03b1k |2 eigk t + |\u03b2k |2 e\u2212igk t ).\n\nk\u2208Wn\u2212\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n-5\n\n0\n\nB\n\n5\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\nB\n\nFIG. 1: The distribution of the energies obtains from the random walks with the steps given by the coupling size and in\nthe direction (+gk or \u2212gk ) biased by the probabilities |\u03b1k |2\nand |\u03b2k |2 as in Eq. (10) (although in these examples we set\n|\u03b1k |2 = 1/2). (a) When all the couplings have the same size\ngk = g (Eq. (13)), a simple Newton's triangle leads to an approximate Gaussian for the distribution of energies. (b) When\nthe couplings differ from step to step (Eq. (21)), the resulting\ndistribution still has a approximately Gaussian envelope for\nlarge N .\n\nThe terminal points Bn of the random walks may or may\nnot be degenerate: As seen in Fig. (1), in the degenerate\ncase, the whole collection of 2N random walks \"collapses\"\ninto N + 1 terminal energies. More typically, in the nondegenerate case [also displayed in Fig. (1)], there are 2N\ndifferent terminal energies Bn . In any case, the \"envelope\" of the distribution \u03b7(B) will be Gaussian, as we\nshall argue below.\nLet us compute the characteristic function \u03b7(B). If we\ndenote xk the random variable that takes the value +gk\nor \u2212gk with probability |\u03b1k |2 or |\u03b2k |2 respectively, then\nits mean value ak and its variance bk are\nak = (|\u03b1k |2 \u2212 |\u03b2k |2 )gk ,\nb2k = gk2 \u2212 a2k = 4|\u03b1k |2 |\u03b2k |2 gk2 .\n\n(16)\n\nThe \"random walk\" picture that yielded the distribution of the couplings remains valid [see Fig. (1.b)]. However, now the individual steps in the random walk are no\nlonger all equal. Rather, they are given by the set {gk }\n[see Eq. (1)] with each step gk taken just once in a given\nwalk. There are 2N such distinct random walks Wn , one\nfor every state |ni of the environment. Each walk contributes to \u03b7(B) with the weight given by the product of\nthe relevant |\u03b1k |2 and |\u03b2k |2 , or right (k \u2208 Wn+ ) and left\n(k \u2208 Wn\u2212 ) \"steps\" respectively.

In this case r(t) decays exponentially. The\nhistogram and the dashed line in r(t) correspond to N = 20,\nthe straight thin line is a particular case for N = 100 and\nthe thick line is the average. We note that the convergence\nis slower than in the Gaussian case of Fig. 2, because realizations of gk are more likely to have one or two dominant\ncouplings. Therefore, although the average shows a clear exponential decay, fluctuations are noticeable even for large N .\nFIG. 2: Assumed distribution of the couplings gk , and resulting distribution of the eigenenergies Bn (left panels) for\nN = 6 and N = 24. In the case of |\u03b1k |2 = 1/2 this distribution is in effect the \"strength function\" (local density of\nstates).

Such a distribution could be obtained\nfor instance by considering dipolar interaction between\nspins randomly placed in a sample. The long range nature of the interaction gives rise to the Lorentzian distribution and therefore to the exponential decay that can\nbe deduced by statistical arguments [12].\n\nk\n\n(21)\n\nan expression in excellent agreement with numerical results already for modest values of N .

This conclussion\nholds whenever the initial distribution of the couplings\nhas a finite variance. Note that in particular, we did not\nhave to assume \"randomness\" of the couplings gk [see\ne.g. Eqs. (13)-(15)].\nA random initial state for the environment (not necessarily a product state) instead of Eq. (12) gives basically\nthe same result.

Here, the possible limit distributions are given by the stable (or L\u00e9vy) laws [11]. One\n\nA.\n\nRelation to the Loschmidt echo\n\nThe Fourier transform of the strength function \u03b7(B) is\nalso related to the Loschmidt echo [13] (or fidelity) in the\nso called Fermi Golden rule regime. The fact that the purity and the fidelity have closely related decay rates has\nbeen recently shown [15] for the case of a bath composed\nof non\u2013interacting harmonic oscillators. In this sense our\nresults could be interpreted as an extension of the discussion of Ref. [15] to spin environments.\nThe connection with fidelity is more easily seen if we\nwrite a generalized version of the Hamiltonian (1),\nHSE =\n\n\u0001\n1\n|0i h0| \u2297 HE0 + |1i h1| \u2297 HE1 .\n2\n\n(24)\n\nThe decoherence factor is then the overlap of the initial\nstate of the environment |\u03a8E (0)i evolved with two different Hamiltonians,\n0\n\n1\n\nr(t) = h\u03a8E (0)| eiHE t/2 e\u2212iHE t/2 |\u03a8E (0)i ,\n\n(25)\n\nwhich clearly has the form of the amplitude of the\nLoschmidt echo for the environment with the two states\nof the system as the perturbation. In the model of Eq.\n(1), HE0 = \u2212HE1 and thus\n1\n\nr(t) = h\u03a8E (0)| e\u2212iHE t |\u03a8E (0)i .\n\n(26)\n\nThis expression is the survival probability of the initial\nstate of the environment under the action of the Hamiltonian HE1 , which is known to be the Fourier transform\n\n\f5\nof the strength function [16]. This connection provides\nanother way to understand Eq. (9).\nIII.\n\nDECOHERENCE AND DYNAMICS\n\nIn this section we will study the more general Hamiltonian of Eq. (2), that is we will include a self Hamiltonian\nto the central system. The results of the previous section will be contained in the limit of \u2206 = 0, however we\nwill see that for any finite \u2206 the behavior of the decoherence factor will be non-trivially different from what we\nobtained in the previous section.\nDespite its more complex appearence, the model given\nby Eq. (2) is still exactly solvable [17].

However, we can solve the two limiting cases\nsN \u226b \u2206 and sN \u226a \u2206, which turn out to give non-trivial\nresults.\nLet us consider first the case where sN \u226b \u2206, that\nis, where the central spin dynamics is so slow that its\n\npy (t) = py (0)e\u22122t\n\n2 2\nsN\n\nr\n\u221a\n\u2206 \u03c0\n\u2212 pz (0)\nErf( 2sN t)\nsN 2\nr\n\u221a\n\u2206 \u03c0\npz (t) = pz (0) + py (0)\n(34)\nErf( 2sN t),\nsN 2\n2 2\nsN\n\nwhere Erf(x) is the error function.

Supposing that B takes only two possible\nvalues, \u00b1sN , the solution for each field B is the precession of\nthe polarization around \u03a9~\u00b1 = (\u2206, 0, \u00b1sN ). The total polarization is the average of the two cones, which gives a small\nresidue along the Z axis. The polarization in X is almost\nfully preserved.\n\nIn the long time limit (t \u226b \u2206/s2N ) these\nare\n\u0011\n\u0010 expressions\n\u2206\n\u2243 1. The\nequal to Eqs. (35), only that now \u03b3 \u221a2s\nN\nresults above for large and small \u2206 agree well with numerical simulations, as shown in Fig. (4).\nA.\n\nPointer basis\n\nThe above results allow us to draw some conclusions\nabout the nature of the decoherence process and the\npointer states which are dynamically selected by the environment. First, we can notice that for long times the\npolarization vector converges to a certain value (which,\nin general, depends on \u2206 and other parameters of the\nmodel). Second, we note that when \u2206 6= 0 the X component of the polarization vector does not decay to zero\nbut is resilient to the interaction with the environment.\nThis is the case even if the system interacts with the\nenvironment through the Z component of the spin.\nThe states which are dynamically selected by the environment are dramatically different in the two oposite\n\n(36)\n\nregimes we examined above. For small values of \u2206, the\neigenstates of the Z component of the central spin are\npointer states. They are minimally perturbed by the interaction with the environment (in the previous section,\nwhere \u2206 = 0 was assumed, this emerged as an exact result since pz is conserved). However, for large \u2206 (i.e.\n\u2206 \u226b sN ), the fact that px (t \u2192 \u221e) \u2243 1 is a signature of\nthe decoherence process selecting a completely different\nset of pointer states. In fact, in this case, the pointer\nstates turn out to be eigenstates of the system Hamiltonian, which is proportional to \u03c3x . Thus, this model\nenables us to examine these two very different situations:\none where the interaction with the environment dominates (\u2206 \u226a sN ) and \u03c3z eignestates are selected; the\nother where the self\u2013Hamiltonian of the system dominates (\u2206 \u226b sN ) and \u03c3x eigenstates are selected.\n\nThe regime where the Hamiltonian of the system dominates (or, more precisely, where the environment is much\nslower than the system) was analyzed in a more general contex before [6] and has a natural interpretation\nhere: This behavior is simply the one corresponding to\nthe strong decoupling regime observed in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance [18]. There, the presence of a strong\nmagnetic field in the X or Y axes effectively decouples the\nspectrally resolvable spins of a sample (whose interaction\nis Z dominant). The standard picture of this decoupling\nregime is that by rotating the polarization rapidly enough\naround X, any interaction in another axis is strongly suppressed and the spins effectively \"decouple\".\n\nThere is an instructive physical picture to understand\nthese results. Instead of using a continuos distribution for\nB, let us suppose that B can only take two values, \u03b7(B) =\n[\u03b4(B \u2212 sN ) + \u03b4(B + sN )]/2, with sN \u226a \u2206. The classical\nsolution for the evolution of the polarization vector is\n~ \u00b1 = (\u2206, 0, \u00b1sN ), as shown\nthe precession of p~ around \u03a9\nin Fig. (5) for two possible initial conditions of p~. The\npolarization vector of the reduced system is the average\nof the two cones corresponding to the precession around\n~ + and \u03a9\n~ \u2212 The presence of a small component \u2206 in the\n\u03a9\nZ axis tilts the precession cones so that their average is\nalmost 1 in the X direction and has a small residue on the\nZ axis (the Y component cancels due to the symmetry).\n\n\f8\n\nWe have studied a very simple model of decoherence\ndue to spin environments. We showed that the decoherence factor will generically have a Gaussian decay when\nthere is no self\u2013Hamiltonian for the system. We note that\nsimilar behavior was observed for short times by studying\nthe decoherence process in models where the largest energy scale is the system-environment interaction strength\n[19]. A model similar to (1) is used in the NMR setting\n[12] to compute corrections to the second and fourth moments of the decay of the polarization signal. Here the\nidea is to treat the interaction with surrounding spins\nas an effective local magnetic field that shifts the Larmor frequency inhomogenuosly across the sample. The\nstatistical treatment used in [12] contrasts with the exact solution presented in this work, even in the presence of a self\u2013Hamiltonian of the central spin. Thus, our\n\nmodel has applicability and relevance to a larger class of\nphysical situations. There is a substantial body of work\n[17, 20, 21, 22] on decoherence due to spin environments,\nstimulated in part by the interests of quantum computation. Our results are most relevant for quantum error\ncorrection and other strategies to fight decoherence in a\nquantum computer. For example Gaussian time dependence of the decoherence factor would suggest a different\n(more frequent) error correction than the exponential dependence often assumed with little or no justification.\nWe also showed how by adding a self-Hamiltonian for\nthe system one can dramatically change the main features\nof the decoherence process. Even for the case of slow dynamics of the system, we found that for long times the\ninitial Gaussian behavior changes to a power law. On the\nother end, when the self-Hamiltonian is much stronger\nthan the interaction with the environment, the whole\nprocess changes its nature. The decay is predominantly a\npower law. Moreover, the pointer states now correspond\nto eigenstates of the system rather than eigenstates of\nthe system-environment interaction [6]. For illustrative\npurposes, our results are summarized schematically in\nFig.(6) using the Bloch sphere representation.\nOur results, though interesting, arise from a very simplified model. A logical step for future research is the\ninclusion of intra-bath interactions. The entanglement\nthus created between spin baths will surely have an impact on the amount of decoherence in the system [23].\nPossible experimental applications of our considerations are in nuclear magnetic resonance, and in any other\nsituation where two-level systems interact with spin environments. Another area of impact of our results is in the\ncharacterization of the process that leads to redundancy\nin the environment of the classical information about the\nsystem [24]. The relation between the decoherence factor\nand the strength function might prove useful in the physical setting of strongly interacting fermions, where it has\nbeen shown that the strength function takes a Gaussian\nshape [25]. It is our hope that the simple analytic model\ndescribed here will assist in gaining further insights into\nthese fascinating problems.\nWe acknowledge fruitful discussions with D.A.R.\nDalvit, V.V.

Intermediate times (center) are similar for \u2206 = 0 and\n\u2206 \u226a sN , where decoherence reduces the Bloch sphere equally\nfast (Gaussian) in the X and Y axes. For large \u2206, Y and Z\naxes are decohered in a slower algebraic way. For long times,\nright panel, the \u2206 = 0 case is completely decohered to the Z\naxis, while the small \u2206 retains some polarization along the\nX axis. The large \u2206 case is almost the opposite, retaining\nalmost all polarization in the X axis and a small residue in\nthe Z axis.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\f9\n\n[8]\n[9]\n\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n\nAstron.
