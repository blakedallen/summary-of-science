Tangential families naturally arise in Geometry of Caustics (see [4]) and in Differential Geometry.\nFor example, the tangent geodesics of a curve in a Riemannian surface define a tangential\nfamily. Envelopes of tangential families with singular support are studied in [6] and [7].\nThe roots of the theme go back to Huygens' investigation of caustics of rays of light.\nThe theory of tangential families is a part of Envelope theory. Thom showed in [9] that the\nsingularities of envelopes of generic 1-parameter families of smooth plane curves are semicubic\ncusps and transversal self-intersections. Normal forms of generic families of plane curves near\nregular points of the envelope have been found by V.I. Arnold (see [1] and [2]).\nHowever, our study differs from the approaches of Thom and Arnold. For example, for\nthe first time the situation when the support curve is not the only local component of the\nenvelope is studied.\nThe aim of this paper is to classify, up to Left-Right equivalence, the singularities of\ntangential family germs which are stable under small deformations among tangential families,\nand to study their envelopes. We prove that in addition to a regular envelope, there exists just\none more local stable singularity of envelopes, the second order self-tangency. Applications\nto families of geodesics emanating tangentially from a regular curve on a Riemannian surface\nare given.\nAcknowledgements. I wish to express my deep gratitude to V.I. Arnold for suggesting me\nto study this problem and for his careful reading of this paper. I also like to thank M. Garay\nfor very useful discussions and comments, M. Kra\u00efem and F. Aicardi for their encouragement.\n\u2217\n\nResearch partially supported by Istituto Nazionale Di Alta Matematica F. Severi.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nPreliminary definitions\n\nUnless otherwise specified, all the objects considered below are supposed to be of class C \u221e ;\nby curve we mean an embedded 1-submanifold of R2 .\nLet us consider a map f : R2 \u2192 R2 of the plane R2 , whose coordinates are denoted by\n\u03be and t. If \u2202t f vanishes nowhere, then f defines the 1-parameter family of the plane curves\nparameterized by f\u03be := f (\u03be, *); these curves may have double points. The map f is called a\nparameterization of the family.\nDefinition. The family parameterized by f is called a tangential family if \u2202\u03be f and \u2202t f are\nparallel non zero vectors at every point (\u03be, t = 0), and the image of f (*, 0) is an embedded\ncurve, called the support of the family.\nWe remark that the curves parameterized by f\u03be are tangent to the support \u03b3 at f (\u03be, 0).\nThe graph of the tangential family is the surface\n\u03a6 := {(q, p) : q = f (\u03be, 0), p = f (\u03be, t), \u03be, t \u2208 R} \u2282 \u03b3 \u00d7 R2 .\nLet us consider the two natural projections of \u03a6 on \u03b3 and R2 , \u03c01 : (q, p) 7\u2192 q and \u03c02 : (q, p) 7\u2192\np. The first projection \u03c01 is a fibration; the images by \u03c02 of its fibers are the curves of the\nfamily.\nThe criminant set of the tangential family is the critical set of \u03c02 ; the envelope is the\napparent contour of its graph in the plane (i.e., the critical value set of \u03c02 ). By the very\ndefinition, the support of a tangential family belongs to its envelope.\nOur study of tangential families being local, we consider their parameterizations as elements of (m\u03be,t )2 , where m\u03be,t is the space of function germs in two variables vanishing at the\norigin. We denote by X0 the subset of (m\u03be,t )2 formed by all the map germs parameterizing a\ntangential family.\nRemark. The graph of a tangential family germ is smooth.\nLet us denote by Diff(R2 , 0) the group of the diffeomorphism germs of the plane keeping\nfixed the origin, and by A the direct product Diff(R2 , 0) \u00d7 Diff(R2 , 0). Then the group A\nacts on (m\u03be,t )2 by the rule (\u03c6, \u03c8) * f := \u03c8 \u25e6 f \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 . Two map germs of (m\u03be,t )2 are said to be\nLeft-Right equivalent, or A -equivalent, if they belong to the same A -orbit. The singularity\nof a tangential family germ is its A -equivalence class. Note that X0 is not A -invariant.\nRemark. Critical value sets of A -equivalent map germs are diffeomorphic; in particular,\nenvelopes of A -equivalent tangential families are diffeomorphic.\nIn some situations, as for instance in the study of geodesic tangential family evolution\nunder small perturbations of the metric, it would be natural to perturb a tangential family\nonly among tangential families.\nDefinition. A p-parameter tangential deformation of a tangential family f : R2 \u2192 R2 is a\nmapping F : R2 \u00d7 Rp \u2192 R2 , such that F\u03bb := F (*; \u03bb) is a tangential family for every \u03bb and\nF0 = f .\nFor example, the translation of the origin is a 2-parameter tangential deformation. An\nanaloguous definition holds for germs. The notion of tangential deformation of a tangential\nfamily germ can be extended to its whole A -orbit via the action of the group A on m\u03be,t .\n2\n\n\fRemark. A tangential deformation induces a smooth deformation on the family support.\nA singularity is said to be stable if, for every representative f of it, every tangential\ndeformation F\u03bb of f has a singularity A -equivalent to that of f at some \u03bb-depending point,\narbitrary close to the origin for \u03bb small enough.\nWe end this section recalling some definitions (see e.g. [5], [8]). The extended tangent\n2\nspace at f \u2208 (m\u03be,t )2 to its A -orbit is the subspace of E\u03be,t\ndefined by\nTe A (f ) := h\u2202\u03be f, \u2202t f iE\u03be,t + f \u2217 (Ex,y ) * R2 ,\nwhere E\u03be,t is the ring of the function germs (R2 , 0) \u2192 R in the variables \u03be, t and the homomorphism f \u2217 : Ex,y \u2192 E\u03be,t is defined by f \u2217 g := g \u25e6 f . Every E\u03be,t -module can be viewed as an\nEx,y -module via this homomorphism. The extended codimension of f is the dimension of the\n2\nquotient space E\u03be,t\n/Te A (f ) as a real vector space.\n\n3\n\nStable tangential family germs\n\nIn this section we state our main results. The proofs are given in section 5.\nTheorem 1. All the stable singularities of tangential family germs are those listed in the\ntable below, together with their extended codimension.\nSingularity\nI\nII\n\nRepresentative codim\n(\u03be + t, t2 )\n0\n2\n(\u03be + t, t \u03be)\n1\n\nCorollary. The envelope of any tangential family germ having a singularity I is smooth,\nwhile the envelope of any tangential family germ having a singularity II has an order 2 selftangency.\nTangential families representing stable singularities I and II, together with their envelopes,\nare depicted in figure 1.\n\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\nFigure 1: Stable tangential family germs and their envelopes.\n\n3\n\n\fRemark. Singularity I is a fold. Its extended codimension being 0, every small enough\ndeformation of it is tangential. On the other hand, the extended codimension of singularity\nII is equal to 1: there exist non tangential deformations. Under such deformations, the family\nenvelope experiences a beak to beak perestroika.\nLet us consider a tangential family germ f \u2208 X0 . The fiber \u03c02\u22121 (0, 0) of the projection\n\u03c02 : \u03a6 \u2192 R2 defines a vertical direction in the tangent plane of the family graph \u03a6 at the\norigin. Note that the branch of the criminant set of f , projecting into the support, is non\nvertical.\nDefinition. A tangential family germ is said to be of first type if its criminant set has only\none branch, of second type if it has exactly two branches, provided that they are smooth,\ntransversal and non vertical.\nStable tangential family germs admit the following characterization.\nTheorem 2. A tangential family germ has a singularity I (resp., II) if and only if it is of\nfirst type (resp., of second type).\n\n4\n\nExamples and applications\n\nThe simplest example of tangential family is that of the tangent lines to a curve in the\nEuclidean plane. This example can be generalized replacing the Euclidean structure by\na Riemannian structure: every curve in a Riemannian surface (M, g) defines the geodesic\ntangential family formed by its tangent geodesics. By simplicity, we assume M compact.\nGenerically, a smooth map f : S1 \u2192 M defines a curve, whose singularities may be\nonly transversal self-intersections. In this case, we call geodesic envelope of f the envelope\nof the geodesic tangential family of support f (S1 ). Here, as well as in Theorem 3 below,\n\"generically\" means that the mappings satisfying the claim form an open dense subset of\nC \u221e (S1 , M) for the Whitney topology.\nA deformation of the metric induces a tangential deformation on the geodesic envelope\nof f (fixing the support); similarly, a small enough deformation of the function f induces a\ntangential deformation of its geodesic envelope.\nTheorem 3. The geodesic envelope of a smooth map f : S1 \u2192 M is generically a curve,\nwhose singularities may be only transversal self-intersections, semicubic cusps and order 2\nself-tangencies. All the envelope singular points form a discrete set; the envelope order 2\nself-tangencies coincide with the inflection points of f (S1 ). Moreover, this envelope is stable\nunder small perturbations of f and of the metric.\nThorem 3 follows from Theorem 1 and Thom's Transversality Lemma. A similar statement holds if we replace the Riemannian structure with a projective structure.\nWe discuss now an example of a global geodesic tangential family whose envelope has\ninfinitely many branches.\nLet us consider the sphere S2 \u2282 R3 equipped with the induced metric. Let \u03b3r \u2282 S2 be\na circle of radius r in R3 and let f : S1 \u00d7 R \u2192 S2 be a parameterization of the geodesic\n\n4\n\n\ftangential family of support \u03b3r in S2 , where for every \u03be \u2208 S1 \u2243 \u03b3r , the map f\u03be : R \u2192 S2 is a\n2\u03c0-periodical parameterization of the S2 great circle at \u03be.\nThe family envelope has two branches, \u03b3r and its opposite circle \u2212\u03b3r , each one having\ninfinite multiplicity. Indeed, the curve det Df (\u03be, t) = 0 has infinitely many branches\nCn := (\u03be \u2208 S 1 , t = n\u03c0) ,\n\nn\u2208Z.\n\nNote that En = (\u22121)n \u03b3r , where En := f (Cn ) is called the order n envelope of \u03b3r .\nLet S\u03032 be a small perturbation of the sphere. Denote by \u03b3\u0303r the support of the perturbed\nfamily and by f \u0303 : S1 \u00d7R \u2192 S\u03032 a parameterization of the perturbed geodesic tangential family.\nFix N, M \u2208 N arbitrary large, N < M.\nTheorem 4. If S\u03032 is close enough to S2 , then the order n envelopes of \u03b3\u0303r are generic spherical\nclosed caustics with zero Maslov number for |n| < M, smooth for |n| < N.\nProof. If S\u03032 is close enough to S2 , for every n < M the curves C\u0303n are pairwise disjoint\nsmall perturbations of the curves Cn . Each order n envelope is a small perturbation of the\ncorresponding order n unperturbed envelope. Since the unperturbed tangential family is\nof first type at every point of its envelope, by Theorem 1 the perturbed family is of first\ntype at any point of the envelope branches \u1ebcn for every |n| < N, provided that S\u03032 is close\nenough to S2 . The perturbed envelope \u1ebcn can be viewed as a caustic, images of \u1ebcn\u22121 under\na geodesic flow. Hence, generic singularities of caustics, as semicubic cusps and transversal\nself-intersection, may arise in envelopes \u1ebcn for N < n < M.\nConsider now a fixed arbitrary small perturbation S\u03032 of S2 .\nTheorem 5. The first order envelope of \u03b3\u0303r has at least four cusps, provided that S\u03032 is a\ngeneric convex surface close to the sphere and r is small enough.\nProof. When r \u2192 0, \u03b3\u0303r shrinks about a point of S\u0303 2 and the envelope branches \u1ebcn , defined\nfor n < M, approach the order n caustics of this point. If S\u03032 is a generic convex surface close\nenough to S2 , then the Last Geometrical Theorem of Jacobi states that the first caustic of\nany generic point has at least 4 cusps (see [3]).\nFor a fixed n, the caustic of order n of a point has at least four cusps, provided that\nthe perturbation is small enough. But whether it holds simultaneously for all the values n\nprovided that the perturbation is small enough is still a conjecture (see [3]). This conjecture\ncan be generalized to envelopes of closed convex smooth curves of small length on convex\nsurfaces.\n\n5\n\nProof of Theorem 1 and 2\n\nIn order to prove Theorem 1 and 2, we introduce now a prenormal form to which is possible\nto bring every tangential family germ by an A -equivalence. This prenormal form does not\nbelong to X0 and it is not unique. We denote by \u03b4(n) any function in two variables with\nvanishing n-jet at the origin.\n\n5\n\n\fLemma 1. Every germ f \u2208 X0 is A -equivalent to a map germ of the form\n\u0001\n(\u03be, t) 7\u2192 \u03be, k0t2 + (\u03b1 \u2212 k1 )t3 + k1 t2 \u03be + t2 * \u03b4(1) ,\nfor some coefficients k0 , k1 , \u03b1 \u2208 R.\n\nProof. Let us consider a representative of the tangential family germ, defined in an arbitrary\nsmall neighborhood U of the origin. Fix a new coordinate system {x, y} in U, such that the\nsupport is y = 0. Denote by \u0393\u03be the family curve corresponding to the support point (\u03be, 0).\nDefine k0 and k1 by the expansion k0 + k1 \u03be + o(\u03be) (for \u03be \u2192 0) of half of the curvature of \u0393\u03be\nat (\u03be, 0); \u03b1 is similarly defined by the expansion k0 t2 + \u03b1t3 + o(t3 ) for t \u2192 0 of the function,\nwhose graph in U is \u03930 . For any small enough value of \u03be, \u0393\u03be can be parameterized near (\u03be, 0)\nby its projection \u03be + t on the x-axis. In this manner we get a parameterization of the family,\nthat can be written as\n\u0001\n(\u03be, t) 7\u2192 t + \u03be, k0t2 + k1 t2 \u03be + \u03b1t3 + t2 * \u03b4(1) .\nTaking \u03be + t and t as new parameters, we obtain the required germ.\n\nThe type of a tangential family germ is determined by its prenormal form.\nLemma 2. A tangential family germ (in prenormal form) is of first type if and only if k0 6= 0;\nit is of second type if and only if k0 = 0 and k1 6= 0, \u03b1.\nLemma 2 follows from Lemma 1 by a direct computation.\nRemark. Consider any representative f \u0304 of f \u2208 X0 . Then f is of first type if and only if\nthe curve \u0393\u03be , parameterized by f \u0304\u03be , has an order 1 tangency with the support \u03b3 at f \u0304(\u03be, 0) for\nevery small enough \u03be. Moreover, if f is of second type, then the tangency order of \u03b3 and \u03930\nis at least 2, the tangency order of \u0393\u03be and \u03b3 being 1 for every small enough \u03be 6= 0.\nThe proof of Theorem 2 is divided into two steps.\nStep 1. Every tangential family germ of first type is A -equivalent to the representative\nfI (\u03be, t) := (\u03be + t, t2 ) of singularity I.\nProof. By Lemmas 1 and 2, every first type tangential family germ is A -equivalent to a map\ngerm of the form (\u03be, t2 + \u03b4(2)). Now, it is well known that the 2-jet (\u03be, t2 ) is A -sufficient and\nstable, so its extended codimension is 0. Finally, (\u03be, t2 ) is A -equivalent to fI .\nStep 2. Every tangential family germ of second type is A -equivalent to the representative\nfII (\u03be, t) := (\u03be + t, \u03bet2 ) of singularity II.\nProof. Let us set h(\u03be, t) := (\u03be, \u03bet2 + t3 ); this germ is A -equivalent to fII . By Lemmas 1\nand 2, every second\n\u0001 type tangential family germ is A -equivalent to a germ of the form\nh + 0, Pn + \u03b4(n) , for some homogeneous polynomial Pn of degree\nn > 3. We prove now\n\u0001\nthat every such a germ is A -equivalent to a germ h + 0, \u03b4(n) . This equivalence provides\nby induction the formal A -equivalence between the initial prenormal form and h.\nFor any fixed i \u2208 {2, . . . , n}, we can kill the term on \u03be n\u2212i ti in Pn , changing the coefficient\nof \u03be n\u2212i+1 ti\u22121 and higher order terms. This is done by the coordinate change\n(\u03be, t) 7\u2192 (\u03be, t + a\u03be n\u2212i ti\u22122 ) ,\n6\n\n\ffor a suitable a \u2208 R. Hence, we may assume Pn (\u03be, t) = A\u03be n\u22121 t + B\u03be n . Moreover, we can\nalso suppose B = 0, up to the coordinate change (x, y) 7\u2192 (x, y \u2212 Bxn ). Now, the coordinate\nchange (\u03be, t) 7\u2192 (\u03be + 3A\u03be n\u22122 /2, t \u2212 A\u03be\u0001n\u22122 /2) takes our germ to the form h + (A\u03be n\u22122 , \u03b4(n)),\nwhich is A -equivalent to h + 0, \u03b4(n) .\nWe compute now the extended codimension of h. Since hhiE\u03be,t = h\u03be, t3iE\u03be,t , the Ex,y module E\u03be,t is generated by 1, t and t2 (Preparation Theorem). Now it is easy to check that\nall the vector monomials (\u03be p tq , 0) for p + q \u2265 0 and (0, \u03be p tq ) for p + q \u2265 2 belong to the\ntangent space Te A (h), so we have\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n0\n0\n2\nE\u03be,t = Te A (h) + Ex,y *\n= Te A (h) \u2295 R *\n;\n(5.1)\nt\nt\nindeed, (0, t) does not belong to Te A (h). This proves that the extended codimension of h is\nequal to 1. In particular, h is finitely determined.\nWe prove now Theorem 1. The fold fI is stable under any small deformation (see e.g. [8]),\nin particular under small tangential deformations. Equality (5.1) implies that the mapping\nH : R2 \u00d7 R \u2192 R2 , defined by H(\u03be, t; \u03bb) := h(\u03be, t) + \u03bb(0, t), is an A -miniversal deformation\nof h. Under this deformation, the critical set of h experiences a beak to beak perestroika, so\nthe deformation is not tangential.\nThis allows us to prove that singularity II is stable under small tangential deformations.\nLet us consider a p-parameter tangential deformation K of h. By the very definition of\nversality, K can be represented as\nK(\u03be, t; \u03bc) \u2261 \u03a8(H(\u03a6(\u03be, t; \u03bc), \u039b(\u03bc)), \u03bc) ,\nwhere \u03a6(*; \u03bc) and \u03a8(*; \u03bc) are deformations of the identity diffeomorphisms of the source and\nthe target planes R2 and \u039b is a function germ (Rp , 0) \u2192 (R, 0). Therefore, for any fixed \u03bc,\nthe critical value sets of K(*, \u03bc) and H(\u03a6(*; \u03bc), \u039b(\u03bc)) are diffeomorphic. Assume \u039b 6\u2261 0; then\nthere exists an arbitrary small \u03bc0 for which \u039b(\u03bc0 ) 6= 0. Hence, when \u03bc goes from 0 to \u03bc0 ,\nthe envelope of the deformed family K\u03bc experience a beak to beak perestroika. Since the\ndeformation K is tangential, this is impossible, so \u039b \u2261 0 and H is trivial. This proves that\nsingularity II is stable.\nLet us consider now a tangential family germ f in prenormal form. Then the 1-parameter\ntangential deformation f (\u03be, t) + \u03bb(0, t3 + \u03bet2 ) is non trivial whenever f is neither of first nor\nsecond type. Indeed, for any small enough \u03bb, the deformed family has a singularity of type\nII at the origin. This proves that every tangential family germ, stable under small tangential\ndeformations, has a singularity I or II. The proof of Theorem 1 is now completed.\n\nReferences\n[1] Arnold, V.
