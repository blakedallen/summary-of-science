Much effort has been devoted to\nthe study of star-forming galaxies at low, intermediate, and high redshift in the last decade\n(among others, Songaila et al. 1994; Gallego et al. 1995; Lilly et al. 1996; Ellis et al. 1996;\nHogg et al. 1998; Jones & Bland-Hawthorn 2001; Pettini et al. 2001; Pascual et al. 2001;\nTresse et al. 2001). These studies have revealed that the comoving star formation rate\n(SFR) density of the Universe has increased by an order of magnitude from the present time\nto z \u223c 1 \u2212 2. The behavior beyond redshift z \u223c 2 is still an open issue, with some results\nindicating a declining SFR with redshift, while others suggest little or no evolution.\nIf we want to understand how the star-formation process has evolved with time, the\nstatistical determination of the star formation history of the Universe as a whole needs to be\ncomplemented with the characterization of the star-formation properties of the individual\ngalaxies. This is not an easy task for high-z objects, given their small angular size and\nfaintness, but some progress is being made. Complementary studies of local samples of starforming galaxies are also clearly needed for comparison purposes, and to provide information\non the end-point of the evolution. Thus, detailed analysis of the spatial distribution and intensity of the star formation in local galaxies may have important implications for studies at\nintermediate and high redshifts. Though evolution certainly plays an important role when\nstudying galaxies at different redshifts, some properties may remain comparable and easily\nmeasurable (Gallego 1998; Conselice et al. 2000a). Several authors have found similarities\nbetween local and distant objects in size (P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2001), intensity of the starburst (Meurer et al. 1997), relationship between the newly-formed stars and the population\nof more evolved stars (P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2003b), stellar mass (Kauffmann et al. 2002),\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\netc. In addition, much work is now focusing on the characterization of local counterparts\nof distant objects (e.g., the Luminous Blue Compact Galaxies in Guzm\u00e1n et al. 1997 and\nPisano et al. 2001, or the UV-bright starburst galaxies in Conselice et al. 2000b).\nKennicutt (1983) carried out pioneering work on the study of the structural properties\nof the recent star formation in normal disk galaxies. This work made use of the H\u03b1+[N II]\nnebular emission as a tracer of the population of young hot stars (responsible for the heating\nof the gas). Similar papers have gone deeper into the issue, following a variety of approaches:\n(1) comparing the rate of star formation with other properties such as the morphology, the\ngas content or the older stellar population content (Kennicutt et al. 1994; Kennicutt 1998b);\n(2) shedding light on the influence of the environment on star formation by studying samples\nof field galaxies, compact groups, and clusters (Gavazzi et al. 1998; Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo & V\u0131\u0301lchez\n1999; Hameed & Devereux 1999); (3) extending the analysis to galaxies with enhanced star\nformation (Conselice et al. 2000b; Chitre & Joshi 2001). These studies demonstrate that the\nuse of H\u03b1 photometry can be extremely useful in the characterization of the youngest stellar\npopulation in star-forming galaxies, and in complementing spectroscopic observations.\nAnother interesting topic outlined relatively recently is the amount of H\u03b1 emission arising from the diffuse ionized gas (DIG) of galaxies (Reynolds 1990). The DIG has been studied\nin nearby normal spiral galaxies with high angular resolution (see, e.g., Lehnert & Heckman\n1994; Hoopes et al. 2001; Zurita et al. 2002). The ionizing source of this interstellar medium\ncomponent is still uncertain: some authors identify it with young hot stars in HII regions,\nwhile others introduce new possibilities such as supernova remnants, turbulent mixing layers\nor even the extragalactic radiation field (Wang et al. 1997). If the link between the DIG\nand the HII regions is confirmed, models should account for the escape of a non-negligible\nfraction of ionizing Lyman photons, which could reach the intergalactic medium. This effect,\nif confirmed, would imply that the factor used when converting from H\u03b1 luminosity to star\nformation rate could be underestimated (see Kennicutt 1998a, and references therein).\nIn this paper we present H\u03b1 imaging observations for a complete sample of local starforming objects: the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM) Survey galaxies (Zamorano\net al. 1994, 1996; Alonso et al. 1999). These galaxies present enhanced star formation in\ncomparison with normal quiescent spiral galaxies (Gil de Paz et al. 2000; P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez\net al. 2003a,b). A comparison of the UCM Survey galaxies with distant objects has been\ncarried out for different properties, including size, total luminosity (P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al.\n2000), mass, and intensity of the star formation episode (P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2003b). This\nsample has often been used as the local benchmark for intermediate and high redshift studies\n(see, for example, Madau et al. 1998).\nThe UCM galaxies have been extensively observed in optical and near infrared photo-\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nmetric passbands (Vitores et al. 1996a; Gil de Paz et al. 2000; P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2000;\nP\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2003a). Optical long-slit spectroscopy (Gallego et al. 1996) is also\navailable for the entire sample. The latter study allowed to obtain emission-line fluxes and\nratios, yielding results on star formation rates (via H\u03b1 fluxes), extinctions (through the\nBalmer decrement), metallicities (using oxygen abundances), etc. However, these observations suffer from the effect of the finite aperture of the slit and the consequent loss of spatial\ninformation. In this sense, spectroscopic observations (commonly centered in the galaxy\nnucleus2 ) may have missed large HII regions in the outer disk zones. In addition, when\naperture corrections are applied, a strongly emitting nucleus may cause the integrated emission to be largely overestimated. The H\u03b1 imaging data presented in this paper complement\nthe spectroscopic observations, providing information about the location of the star-forming\nknots, their intensity and relationship with the host galaxy where the starburst is taking\nplace. In addition, an estimate of the DIG emission will be measured for a complete sample\nof star-forming galaxies.\nThis paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the sample of galaxies and\nobservations used in this work. Next, Section 3 discusses on the results concerning the\ncomparison between imaging and spectroscopy, the concentration and size properties, the\nDIG characterization, the implications for studies at higher redshifts, and the corrections to\nthe local H\u03b1 luminosity function and star formation rate density. Unless otherwise indicated,\nthroughout this paper we use a cosmology with H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9M = 0.3 and\n\u039b = 0.7.\n\n2.\n\nThe sample\n\nThe Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM) Survey for emission-line galaxies was\ncarried out in the late 1980s and early 1990s with two main goals: (1) characterizing the\nstar formation in the local Universe, and (2) studying low metallicity objects (Zamorano\net al. 1994, Lists I; Zamorano et al. 1996, List II; and Alonso et al. 1999, List III). Extensive\nimaging and spectroscopic follow-up observations are available for the vast majority of the\ngalaxies in the sample.\nLong-slit spectroscopy for the UCM galaxies was presented in Gallego et al. (1996, 1997).\nThe mean redshift of the complete sample of 191 emission-line galaxies is 0.026. The sample\nis dominated (57%) by objects with low excitation, relatively high metallicity, and often\n2\n\nIn this paper we will refer to the starbursts in the inner parts of spirals aside nuclear activity as nuclear\nstar formation.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nbright and dusty nuclear starbursts. We call these disk-like galaxies. A significant number\nof high excitation, low metallicity galaxies are also present (32%), and we call them HII-like\ngalaxies. These have blue star-forming knots which may sometimes dominate the optical\nluminosity of the whole galaxy, as in the case of Blue Compact Galaxies (BCDs). A number\nof AGNs (8%) was also detected. For the remaining 3% it was not possible to obtain a\nspectroscopic classification. The spectroscopic data were also used to obtain the luminosity\nfunction and star formation rate density of the local Universe (Gallego et al. 1995, 2002).\nImaging and photometric studies in the Gunn-r (Vitores et al. 1996a,b) and Johnson-B\nbands (P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2000, 2001) have also been carried out. The average magnitudes\nof the sample are mB = 16.1 \u00b1 1.1 (MB = \u221219.2) and mr = 15.5 \u00b1 1.0 (Mr = \u221219.8), with\na mean effective radius of 2.8 kpc (in B). Up to 65% of the sample has been classified as\nSb or later. Near infrared data, stellar masses and the properties of the youngest stellar\npopulation were presented in Gil de Paz et al. (2000) and P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2003a).\nThis paper presents the narrow-band (NB) imaging in the redshifted H\u03b1 passband for\na subsample of 79 galaxies from the UCM Survey. The subset represents \u223c 40% of the\n191 galaxies within the Lists I and II of the survey. These galaxies were selected to ensure\nthat all the spectroscopic types described in Gallego et al. (1996) were represented in the\nsame proportion as in the parent sample. The representativeness of this subsample in H\u03b1\nequivalent width -EW (H\u03b1)- and luminosity has also been tested. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov\ntest using EW (H\u03b1) (a good tracer of the spectroscopic type) for the subsample and the entire\nsample estimates the probability of the former being representative of the latter in 82%. The\nsame test using the H\u03b1 luminosity yielded a probability of 98%. Table 2 presents the sample\nalong with the main results from this H\u03b1 imaging study. For specific details on individual\nobjects, the reader may refer to P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2003a) and references therein.\nThe 79 galaxies used in the present paper were observed in three different campaigns\nand two service nights at the Nordic Optical Telescope3 and two runs at the CAHA 2.2 metre\ntelescope4 .

(5) Weather conditions.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nThe observations included narrow-band imaging centered at the wavelength of the redshifted H\u03b1 emission-line of each galaxy, and broad-band (Cousins-RC ) imaging. The broadband data was used to subtract the continuum of the narrow band images. Typical exposure\ntimes were 900 seconds in RC and 2700s in the NB, allowing us to reach a limiting surface\nbrightness in H\u03b1 (2\u03c3) of \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u221217 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 arcsec\u22122 . The total exposure was split\nin several sub-exposures for cosmic ray and artifact elimination. About 90% of the frames\nwere taken in subarcsecond seeing conditions.\nSome of the data reduction and measurements were carried out using several IRAF\ntasks5 , mainly ccdproc, imcombine and geomap. Other procedures were specially built for\nthis work, including the fringing correction, continuum subtraction, and flux measurement\nprograms. Standard steps were followed in bias subtracting and flat-fielding. Some of the\nbroad band data presented a small level of fringing (1 count per 1000), which was eliminated\nusing an object-free pattern built as a combination of all the frames taken during each night.\nScaling of the pattern was performed for each image. After reduction, the images were\naligned using the positions of \u223c 10 stars, and all the frames of the same galaxy obtained\nwith the same filter were combined.\nEmission-line images were obtained by subtracting the continuum. This was achieved\nthrough the comparison of at least 20 field stars per frame whose emission-line fluxes were\nforced to be null in the final frames. Based on the standard deviation of the ratios between\nthe fluxes of the stars in the NB and the broad-band images, we estimate a \u223c 5% error in\nthe subtraction of the continuum. The procedure left a residual sky background in the H\u03b1\nimages, which was subsequently subtracted.\nLandolt (1992) stars were observed in order to calibrate the RC frames. We included\na B \u2212 RC colour term in the calibration. B \u2212 r colours were taken from P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez\net al. (2000) and converted to B \u2212 RC using a mean value of r \u2212 RC = 0.36 (Fukugita et al.\n1995). This colour is expected to vary in less than 0.04 magnitudes from one morphological\ntype to another. Standard spectrophotometric stars (Oke 1990; Hamuy et al. 1992) were\nalso observed to check the values of the scale factor between the RC and NB filters. Images\ntaken during non-photometric nights were calibrated with short RC exposures obtained in\nother campaigns during photometric conditions.\nIn addition, 8 frames without photometric observations were calibrated using the Gunnr data given in Vitores et al. (1996a). In order to do that, we first determined the correlation\n5\n\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA) under cooperative agreement with the\nNational Science Foundation.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nbetween the RC \u2212 r and B \u2212 r colours in 5\u2032\u2032 apertures with the data of the galaxies observed\nin photometric conditions, obtaining RC \u2212 r = (\u22120.238 \u00b1 0.038) + (0.011 \u00b1 0.047) (B \u2212 r).\nThe unbiased standard deviation of the correlation is 0.08m . This relationship was then used\nto calculate the RC magnitudes and to calibrate the frames obtained in non-photometric\nconditions. In order to estimate the magnitude of the calibration uncertainties, 2\u20133 common\nobjects were observed in all the campaigns.\nThe transmission curves for all the NB filters used (and also RC ) were obtained from the\nobservatories. Typical widths for the NB filters were 50 \u00c5. This value is not small enough\nto completely avoid contamination from the [N II]\u03bb6548 and [N II]\u03bb6584 lines. However,\nthe transmissions at these wavelengths were often rather low in comparison with that of the\nH\u03b1 line (1/2 on average). Pure H\u03b1 fluxes were obtained taking into account these filter\ntransmissions for the three lines, the [N II]/H\u03b1 ratios given by Gallego et al. (1996) for each\nobject, and the scale factors between the RC and NB images obtained with field stars. To\nestimate the extinction corrections, the spectroscopic H\u03b1/H\u03b2 ratios in Gallego et al. (1996)\nwere used. These ratios were corrected for a stellar absorption of 3\u00c5 (Trager et al. 1998;\nGonz\u00e1lez Delgado et al. 1999) and converted to E(B \u2212 V ) using the Galactic extinction\ncurve of Cardelli et al. (1989).\nWe show H\u03b1 and Cousins-RC images of some example galaxies in Figure 1.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Gray-scale representation of some of the images of the UCM Survey galaxies.\nFor each object, H\u03b1 and Cousins-RC images are shown. North is up and east is left.\nAn angular size of 3\u2032\u2032 is marked at the top of each image (horizontal segment). A 2 kpc\ntransversal distance is also depicted on the right of each image (vertical segment). The\n3 first rows plot HII-like galaxies (on the left) and disk-like objects (right). The 2 objects in the last row are BCDs. The images for the entire sample can be accessed in\nhttp://www.ucm.es/info/Astrof/UCM Survey/UCM/ha images.html.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n3.\n3.1.\n\nResults\n\nSpectra vs. imaging\n\nOne of the main goals of the present work was to determine the amount of H\u03b1 emission\nfalling outside the slit employed in the spectroscopic follow-up of Gallego et al. (1996). The\nissue becomes very important when spectroscopic data are used to characterize extended\nobjects. Different approaches have been followed when facing the problem, ranging from\naperture corrections based in broad-band fluxes (Gallego et al. 1995) to the absence of any\ncorrection (Kauffmann et al. 2002).\nFirst, we compared spectroscopic and imaging observations by simulating the long-slit\nin the H\u03b1 frames. Artificial slits were simulated using the information about position angles\nand widths given by Gallego (1995). The centers were chosen as the intensity peaks in\nthe broad-band images, similarly to what was done in the spectroscopic campaigns. The\nmeasurements were repeated 8\u201310 times with small random variations of the center position\nand angle, and then averaged to obtain the most probable value. The average values of the\nspectroscopic fluxes and those measured from the simulated slits are identical (the average\ndifference is lower than 1%), although the median fluxes are 5% larger in the case of the\nsimulated slits. This is probably related to the fact that the simulated apertures were more\nextended along the slit than those used by Gallego et al. (1995). Still, individual differences\nare reasonably below typical spectroscopic uncertainties.\nThe integrated H\u03b1 flux for each object was measured using polygonal apertures enclosing the entire galaxy and also a curve of growth built with circular apertures. The\nestimated errors include Poisson statistics, uncertainties in the sky determination, the standard deviation of the photometric zero-points, and the errors associated with the continuum\nsubtraction.\nFigure 2 shows the comparison between the H\u03b1 fluxes measured in the spectra and the\ntotal H\u03b1 emission in the images (decontaminated from [N II] emission). Symbol sizes are\nrelated to the effective radii in the B-band (in arcsec). On average, the spectroscopic followup of the UCM Survey galaxies detected one third (1/3.0) of the total emission-line flux\ndue to the finite width or a improper positioning of the slit. Due to the asymmetry in the\ndistribution, the corresponding median factor is one half (1/2.0). As expected, the agreement\nbetween photometric and spectroscopic fluxes is better among the compact objects.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Comparison of the H\u03b1 fluxes determined for the spectroscopy and those obtained\nfrom the integrated emission measured in the images(in erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 ). Symbol sizes are related to the effective radii in the B-band (see legend). The lines correspond to Fimaging /Fspectra\nratios of 1, 2, 4 and 6. The average error in the H\u03b1 fluxes derived from the images is shown.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nOur data also indicates that the global EW (H\u03b1) values determined from the imaging\ndata are, on average, a factor 1.8\u00b11.2 smaller than the ones obtained with the long-slit spectroscopy. This value is independent of the galaxies' spectroscopic type. Similar differences\nhave been observed in normal spirals (Kennicutt & Kent 1983). This can be understood\nbecause the EW (H\u03b1) is related to the ratio of newly-born stars (responsible for the emission\nlines) to the evolved underlying population, and thus we expect this quantity to be large for\ngalaxies with relatively important bursts of recent star formation, specially at very young\nages. Since the spectroscopic observations tend to concentrate on the brightest star-forming\nknots, it is not surprising that the EW (H\u03b1)'s derived from the spectra are higher than the\ngalaxies' global values. In addition, the UCM sample is dominated by objects with bright\nnuclear starbursts (Gallego et al. 1996), and again we expect the EW (H\u03b1) measured for\nthe entire galaxy to be smaller than the spectroscopic values. The exception to this are the\ngalaxies for which the long-slit was placed in the galaxy center and missed bright HII regions\nin the disk.\n\n3.2.\n\nConcentration and size properties\n\nThe UCM Survey galaxies present enhanced star formation when compared with 'normal' quiescent spiral (or lenticular) galaxies (Gil de Paz et al. 2000; P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al.\n2003b). Several triggering mechanisms are usually postulated for the activation of massive\nstar formation: tidal forces, mergers, supernova winds, etc. These processes are more efficient\nin the central nuclear zones of the galaxies, where the potential well is deeper and higher gas\ndensities are found (see Kennicutt 1998a, Combes 2001, and references therein). Gas stability criteria would also favour violent star formation events at low radial distances (Quirk\n1972; Kennicutt 1989). Therefore, it is not surprising that 57% of the entire UCM sample\nwas spectroscopically classified as starburst nuclei galaxies. These objects are supposed to be\nexperiencing a massive burst characterized by a high metallicity and low excitation (Gallego\net al. 1996) and placed in the inner parts of the galaxy. Another 32% of the entire survey\nare HII-like galaxies presenting low metallicities and high excitations. Their star formation\ncould be more extended and/or not linked with the galactic nucleus.\nIn this section and the next one, we will study the location of the starburst knots. First,\nwe will focus on the concentration properties of the current star formation in the UCM\nSurvey galaxies. We have calculated the concentration index c31 for the H\u03b1 emission. This\nindex was defined by Gavazzi et al. (1990) as the ratio between the radii of the aperture\ncontaining 75% and 25% of the total flux. We have used isophotal apertures centered in\nthe maximum of the broad-band images. Figure 3 shows the distribution of c31 for our\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nsample of galaxies. The median value and quartiles for the entire sample are indicated.\nA wide range of concentrations are observed. The peak of the distribution is found at\nc31 = 2\u20133, corresponding to galaxies with extended star formation. These values are typical\nof disk-dominated objects when the morphological classification is based on broad-band\nconcentration indices (Gavazzi et al. 1990; Vitores et al. 1996b; P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2001).\nOur sample also includes rather concentrated galaxies with values of c31 up to 10.\nWe must be cautious when interpreting the concentration indices obtained in H\u03b1 images\nand their possible links with nuclear and disk star formation. High concentrations may be\nfound in galaxies with no nucleus or bulge at all but presenting one very bright and intense\nburst (e.g, BCDs). In contrast, a single nuclear burst occupying all the bulge with a flat\nsurface brightness profile may present a rather low c31 value. A more appropriate parameter\nfor the discussion on nuclear and disk emissions will be used in Section 3.3.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Distribution of the c31 concentration index for the UCM sample. The median value\nand quartiles are shown by the error bar. The H\u03b1 images for two extreme cases are plotted\nin gray-scale. Overimposed on them are the contour for the pixels with a surface brightness\nof 23.5 mag arcsec\u22122 in the RC image. North is up and east is left.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nAnother important point to consider when studying the concentration of the emission\nis the size of the starburst zone. In Figure 4 we have plotted the histogram of the effective\nradius (i.e., radius containing half of the light) of the H\u03b1 emission. The distribution peaks at\n\u223c 1 kpc, with three quarter of the galaxies presenting effective radii smaller than 3 kpc. The\nmedian value is almost identical (ours is 0.02dex larger) to that found by Lehnert & Heckman\n(1996) for a sample of edge-on, infrared-warm, starburst galaxies, and \u223c 15% larger than the\nvalues given by Chitre & Joshi (2001) for a sample of Markarian galaxies. The distribution\nof effective radii in the RC -band is also presented in this figure. The average is \u223c 2.5 kpc,\nwhich is also in complete agreement with Lehnert & Heckman (1996). Although we also find\na size-luminosity relationship as the one claimed by these authors, the scatter is very large.\nThe Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient is 0.51 and the two-sided significance level\nof its deviation from zero is 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 . These size distributions reveal that, in a significant\nfraction of the UCM galaxies, the star formation tends to be more concentrated than the\nolder underlying stellar population.\nWe also find a tendency for galaxies with late-type morphologies to have larger H\u03b1\neffective radii. The median values are: 0.51 kpc for S0, 0.82 kpc for Sa, 1.38 kpc for Sb,\n1.91 kpc for Sc+ and 2.12 kpc for irregulars. The median for the sample of BCDs is 0.53\nkpc. The segregation is also noticeable in the case of spectroscopic types: disk-like galaxies\npresent larger values (1.51 kpc) than HII-like objects (0.62 kpc).\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Distribution of the effective radii (in kpc) of the H\u03b1 (solid-line) and continuum\nRC (gray histogram) emission of the UCM Survey galaxies. As before, the H\u03b1 images for\ntwo extreme cases are shown (cf. figure 3).\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nFigure 5 presents the histogram of the ratios of the sizes of the emitting regions and the\nhost galaxies. As a measurement of the size of the star formation zone we use the radius of the\ncircular region containing 80% of the total H\u03b1 emission. The total size of the galaxy has been\ntaken as the radius of the 24.5 mag arcsec\u22122 isophote in the RC image. Both regions have\nbeen centered on the maximum-intensity pixel of the broad-band image. As a consequence,\nthe ratio between the sizes of the H\u03b1 and continuum emissions is strongly affected by the\nanisotropy of the star formation along the galaxy. In particular, this parameter is strongly\naffected by the existence of bursts in the outer parts of the object. The median value of\nthe ratio is 0.5, i.e., the radius of the region where there is active star formation is half of\nthe total optical radius of the galaxy. The values spread from objects where even the most\nexternal zones of the galaxy are involved in the burst process (e.g., UCM1303+2908 and\nUCM1444+2923) to very concentrated galaxies (e.g., UCM0159+2328 and UCM1256+2910).\nThe former are associated with late-type spirals and irregulars (median values range from\n0.5 for S0/Sa to 0.8 for Sc+/Irr, BCDs and interacting systems). No major differences are\nfound between the average values of disk and HII-like galaxies.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- Histogram of the ratio between the sizes of the H\u03b1 emitting region (the radius of\nthe circular region containing 80% of the total H\u03b1 emission) and the entire galaxy (radius\nof the 24.5 mag arcsec\u22122 isophote in the RC image).\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nThe relative sizes of the star-forming region and the host galaxy may also be studied\nby comparing the area of the H\u03b1 emitting zone and the total extension of the object. This\nparameter is not affected by the anisotropy of the star formation. The area of the burst has\nbeen calculated using the procedure explained in Section 3.5, and the extension of the galaxy\nhas been assumed to be the area inside the 24.5 mag arcsec\u22122 isophote. The distribution for\nthe entire sample is flat, with a median value of 0.5 and quartiles at 0.3 and 0.9. Again,\na correlation with Hubble type is observed (from 0.3 for S0/Sa to 0.7 for Sc+/Irr and 1.0\nfor BCDs). On average, disk-like galaxies harbor a star-forming event covering \u223c 40% of\nthe area of the galaxy, while \u223c 70% of the area is covered by star formation in the case of\nHII-like objects.\nOur study of the sizes of the star-forming regions in local galaxies is of direct relevance\nto the interpretation of spectroscopic data from large galaxy surveys such as the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS, Jarrett et al. 2000) or the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS,\nStoughton et al. 2002). In these surveys, the spectroscopic data is obtained using multiobject spectrographs which utilize multi-slit masks or fibers. These slits and fibers have a\nfinite size and force to consider aperture corrections. Our imaging study may be used to\nestimate the importance of these corrections. For example, Figure 6 shows the distribution\nof the ratios of the H\u03b1 flux within an aperture of 3\u2032\u2032 (used by the SDSS) to the total H\u03b1\nflux. A large spread exists in the fractional coverage of the UCM galaxies by this aperture\nsize. The median of the distribution reveals that the SDSS fibers would miss typically 40%\nof the total H\u03b1 emission of UCM-like galaxies, and that more than half of the flux would be\nmissed for 40% of our sample.\nThe inset in the top-left corner of Figure 6 shows the change with redshift of the\nobserved-to-total H\u03b1 flux ratio in a 3\u2032\u2032 circular aperture. We have artificially redshifted\nthe UCM galaxies from their measured redshifts up to z = 1 in \u2206z = 0.01 steps, and estimated the fraction of the fluxes that would be detected inside a 3\u2032\u2032 spectroscopic fiber (or\nslit) for each redshifted object. The calculated points in the top-left panel of Figure 6 are\nthe averages for the entire sample. They have been fitted with a polynomial curve. This plot\nreveals that only beyond redshift \u223c 0.1 the 3\u2032\u2032 aperture contains more than 95% of the total\nflux. For redshifts below this limit, corrections to the H\u03b1 aperture fluxes are non-negligible.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- Comparison of the H\u03b1 emission within a circular aperture of 3\u2032\u2032 (typical of wide\nfield and all sky surveys such as 2MASS or SDSS) to the total flux for the UCM galaxies. The\ninset in the top-left corner shows the change with redshift of the flux ratio in a 3\u2032\u2032 circular\naperture. The values for the entire sample have been calculated by artificially-redshifting\nthe UCM galaxies. Mean values, standard deviations (shaded area) and a polynomial fit are\nshown.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n3.3.\n\nNuclear vs. disk emission\n\nThe relative contribution of the nuclear and the disk components to the total H\u03b1 luminosity will be studied in this section. As we mentioned in Section 3.2, concentration indices\nmay lead to errors when analyzing the location of the starbursts if a bulge-disk characterization is not performed previously. Bulge-disk decomposition for the UCM Survey galaxies was\ncarried out in the Gunn-r and Johnson-B bands by Vitores et al. (1996b) and P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez\net al. (2001), respectively. Using the results for the red filter, we have considered:\nFT\u03b1\n\n=\n\n\u03b1\nFbulge\n\n+\n\n\u03b1\nFdisk\n\n=\n\nR\u221e\n0\n\nF \u03b1 (r) * I r (r) * r * dr\nR\u221e\nI r (r) * r * dr\n0\n\n(1)\n\nr\nr\nwhere FT\u03b1 is the total H\u03b1 flux, F \u03b1 (r) is the radial dependent H\u03b1 flux, I r (r) = Ibulge\n+ Idisk\nis the intensity in the Gunn-r filter, and the integral extends over all radii.\n\u03b1\nIdentifying the nuclear component with the bulge, the H\u03b1 flux Fbulge\narising from this\narea can be calculated using:\n\n\u03b1\nFbulge\n\n2\u03c0\n= r *\nLT\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\nr\nF \u03b1 (r) * Ibulge\n(r) * r * dr\n\n(2)\n\n0\n\nwhere LrT is the integrated luminosity in the r filter. An analogous expression can be built\nfor the H\u03b1 flux of the disk. In Vitores et al. (1996a), the bulge intensity profile was fitted\nusing a de Vaucouleurs (1948) exponential function, and the disk intensity was fitted by a\nFreeman (1970) law. In order to calculate the numerator of Equation 2, the function F \u03b1 (r)\nwas approximated by a series of Chebyshev polynomials. The integral was calculated using\na Gauss-Laguerre quadrature.\nThe method described above was used to obtain the ratio between the bulge and the\ntotal H\u03b1 luminosities \u2013(B/T)(H\u03b1)\u2013. The goodness of the bulge-disk decompositions was\nchecked interactively for each individual object.\nThe median and standard deviation of the (B/T)(H\u03b1) ratios of the sample are 0.26\u00b10.26.\nThis means that a typical UCM galaxy harbours a star formation event with \u223c 30% of nuclear\ncomponent. Therefore, whereas the spectroscopic classification was mainly dominated by\nstarburst nuclei (SBN, Balzano 1983) galaxies, the images reveal that simultaneously to the\nnuclear burst there exists an important amount of recent star formation occurring in the\ndisk. A segregation of (B/T)(H\u03b1) values according to the spectroscopic classification has\nbeen observed: disk-like objects present a median of 0.33 \u00b1 0.26 and HII-like 0.15 \u00b1 0.26.\nThe (B/T)(H\u03b1) is correlated with morphological type in the UCM Survey, as some authors\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nhave claimed for other samples (see, e.g., Kennicutt 1983, 1998a; Lehnert & Heckman 1996).\nThe median values are: 0.43 for lenticulars, 0.45 for Sa, 0.36 for Sb, and 0.05 for late Hubble\ntypes (Sc+/Irr) and BCDs.\n\n3.4.\n\nEquivalent width and luminosity\n\nIn Section 3.1, we argued that EW (H\u03b1) provides a measurement of the relative importance of newly-formed stars with respect to the older population. Unlike 'normal' spiral\ngalaxy samples, all the spiral galaxies in the UCM sample have median integrated EW (H\u03b1)\n(based on imaging data) of about 40 \u2212 50 \u00c5. Even more intense star formation is found in\nirregulars (the average is 70 \u00c5), BCDs (110 \u00c5), and interacting systems (60 \u00c5). The correlation observed between morphological type and EW (H\u03b1) for normal galaxies (Kennicutt\n& Kent 1983; Sauvage & Thuan 1994; Gavazzi et al. 1998) is not present in our sample,\nprobably as a consequence of the enhanced star-forming activity of the UCM galaxies (see\nSection 3, and figure 1 in P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2003a). This is directly related to selection\neffects of the survey, biased towards the detection of objects with high EW (H\u03b1) (larger than\n\u223c 20 \u00c5, Gallego 1995).\nSpectroscopically, disk-like galaxies present considerable lower values of the EW (H\u03b1)\n(24 \u00c5) than HII-like objects (75 \u00c5). This is directly related to the findings of Gil de Paz\net al. (2000) and P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2003b): HII-like objects have higher SFR per unit\nstellar mass than disk-like galaxies.\nThe integrated H\u03b1 emission has been found to be strongly correlated with optical colours\n(Kennicutt & Kent 1983; Kennicutt et al. 1984; Davidge 1992). This means that the youngest\nstars, though not contributing much to the total stellar mass of the galaxy (\u223c 5% for the\nUCM galaxies, cf. P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2003b), have a major influence on the integrated\noptical colours. The correlation is also observed for the UCM sample and is plotted in\nFigure 7. The large scatter of this plot is related to differences in star formation history and\ndust extinction.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- Integrated optical colour (B \u2212 r) vs. imaging equivalent width (\u00c5) relationship.\nThe best fit is plotted: log(EW (H\u03b1)) = (\u22121.707 \u00b1 0.091) \u00d7 (B \u2212 r) + (2.881 \u00b1 0.066). The\nSpearman's rank-order correlation coefficient is -0.55 and the two-sided significance level of\nits deviation from 0 is 4 \u00d7 10\u22127 .\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nAs the next step in our study, we have calculated the H\u03b1 luminosities for the entire sample so that we can compare the imaging-based results with those obtained from spectroscopy\n(cf. Section 3.6). But before we carry out such comparison, it is interesting to see whether\nthe measured luminosities (or the derived SFRs) correlate with any other observables. In\nFigure 8 we have plotted the SFR against the H\u03b1/H\u03b2 ratio, a useful extinction estimator.\nSFRs have been calculated using the conversion factor given in Sullivan et al. (2001), almost\nidentical to the one obtained by Kennicutt (1998a):\n\nSF R =\n\nL(H\u03b1)(erg s\u22121 )\nM\u2299 yr\u22121\n1.22 \u00d7 1041\n\n(3)\n\nFigure 8 shows a clear correlation between the derived SFRs and the extinction. Objects\nwith larger obscurations have also larger SFRs. This effect was also noticed in the stellar\npopulation synthesis analysis presented in P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2003b), where not only\nhigh-extincted galaxies showed higher burst strengths (ratio between the mass of newlyformed stars and the total stellar mass), but they also seemed to follow different extinction\nlaws than low-extinction objects.\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- Relationship between extinction and SFR (or H\u03b1 luminosity, as shown on the\nright-hand side axis). The best linear fit to the data, which takes into account observational\nerrors, is shown (see text). Different symbols are used for different spectroscopic types (see\nlegend). Filled symbols correspond to disk-like galaxies and open ones to HII-like objects\n(see Gallego et al. 1996, and Section 2).\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nThe correlation between SFR and extinction has also been reported in previous works\n(e.g., Hopkins et al. 2001; Sullivan et al. 2001). Our fit to the relationship between the\nSFR and the Balmer decrement (corrected by stellar absorption) is, taking into account\nobservational errors:\nlog(SF R) = (0.597 \u00b1 0.021) \u00d7\n\nH\u03b1\n+ (\u22122.191 \u00b1 0.086)\nH\u03b2\n\n(4)\n\nThe Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient is 0.67 and the two-sided significance\nlevel of its deviation from 0 is 2 \u00d7 10\u221211 . The derived slope is much larger than the one\ngiven in Sullivan et al. (2001) and Hopkins et al. (2001). It is interesting to notice that\nthe correlation seems to saturate for very reddened objects (H\u03b1/H\u03b2 & 7, corresponding to\nE(B \u2212 V ) & 0.9), and therefore the derived regression is not valid for very high extinction\nvalues. This behaviour was not observed by Sullivan et al. (2001) since their ultravioletselected nearby galaxy sample lacks very highly-obscured objects. This is not surprising: the\nselection at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths is strongly biased against highly obscured objects.\nNote also that if we only consider the objects in our sample with Balmer decrements lower\nthan 5.5 (i.e., low-to-moderate extinction), the correlation we find becomes very similar to\nthe one found by Sullivan et al. (2001).\nMost of the objects which do not follow our observed correlation are disk-like galaxies.\nNote also that the DANS (Dwarf amorphous nucleated spheroidals, Salzer et al. 1989) seem\nto follow a different relation from the rest of the objects, presenting relatively low and\nalmost constant SFRs (\u223c1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) for all obscurations. This spectroscopic class, the\nlow luminosity version of SBN objects, has already shown significant differences in other\nproperties such as their stellar mass and SFR per stellar mass (P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2003b).\nThe breakdown of the SFR\u2013extinction relationship at high H\u03b1/H\u03b2 could be a symptom\nof the fact that, at large obscurations, extinction indicators such as the Balmer decrement\nor the slope of the UV continuum fail to correct the observed luminosities (Bell 2002). This\nis also supported by observations of some ultraluminous infrared galaxies, where the UV\nslope indicates a lower extinction than that derived from the UV to far infrared (FIR) ratio\n(Goldader et al. 2002). Observations of the UCM sample in the FIR would be necessary\nto ascertain whether, by using the observed H\u03b1/H\u03b2, we significantly underestimate the\nextinction (and thus the SFR) in some heavily-obscured star-forming regions within the\ngalaxies. It could well be that some star-formation occurs in regions where no H\u03b1 photons\nare able to escape, and therefore such star-formation would be missing in an optically-based\nSFR census.\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\n3.5.\n\nStar-forming knots and diffuse emission\n\nThis section presents the results concerning the analysis of the spatial distribution and\nintensity of the star formation in the UCM galaxies. This study has two main goals: (1)\nto segregate the star-forming knots from the regions with a more diffuse ionized gaseous\ncomponent (DIG), and (2) to characterize the regions with active star formation.\n\n3.5.1. Detection method\nIn order to separate the distinct star-forming knots from the diffuse emission, we have\nfollowed a similar method to the one used by Rozas et al. (1996) and Zurita (2001) to detect\nHII regions and study their luminosity functions in nearby galaxies. The main difference\nis that, due to their higher distances, the angular sizes of the UCM galaxies are much\nsmaller than those of the galaxies studied by these authors. Thus, the average spatial\nresolution element of our H\u03b1 imaging study (i.e., the diameter of the typical seeing disk,\n\u223c 1\u2032\u2032 ) corresponds to \u223c 0.5 kpc. This value is similar to the diameters of the largest\nHII regions found in nearby galaxies (\u223c 400 pc, Youngblood & Hunter 1999; Zurita 2001).\nTherefore, the star-forming regions detected in our sample correspond to large star-forming\ncomplexes rather than normal HII regions. Moreover, the UCM objects present enhanced\nstar formation in comparison with normal quiescent galaxies. This behavior also has an\neffect on the size and intensity of the starbursts.\nThe detection method of the star-forming knots deals with four different issues:\n1.\u2013 The global limit for the detection of any feature was set to 2 times the noise level of\nthe sky background.\n2.\u2013 The criterion for distinguishing an individual star-forming knot from its neighbors was\nthat every local maximum with no other maxima closer than 2 pixels was considered\nas an individual knot. This separation was chosen so that the diameter of any knot\nwould be at least as large as the average diameter of the seeing disk in our frames\n(\u223c 1\u2032\u2032 = 5 pixels).\n3.\u2013 The technique used to decide which pixels belong to each region when there are other\nregions nearby is described in Zurita (2001). The technique is based on the same\nprinciples used by the SExtractor software (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) to de-blend objects.\n4.\u2013 The detection limit for the boundaries (faintest parts) of the star-forming regions was\nchosen to coincide with the upper intensity limit for the diffuse emission (see ahead).\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\nThe value we used was 1.32 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 arcsec\u22122 . The limit corresponds to\nan emission measure6 EM = 65 pc cm\u22126 . The choice of this value is based on several\nstudies of the diffuse ionized medium in spiral galaxies (for example, Ferguson et al.\n1996a,b use a cutoff value of 80 pc cm\u22126 , and Hoopes et al. 1996 use 50 pc cm\u22126 ).\n\n3.5.2. Star-forming knots\nIn the 79 galaxies included in the present study, we have detected 816 distinct starforming knots. The number of regions found in each galaxy ranges widely, from one single\nregion per galaxy to up to 87 regions for one galaxy (UCM2325+2318, a luminous infrared\ngalaxy, Calzetti et al. 2000). The median value is \u223c 8 regions per galaxy. We detect more\nregions in late-type spirals and interacting systems (on average, 12 regions in Sc+ galaxies,\n18 in Irr and 45 in interacting systems) than in early-type spirals (5\u20138 for S0/Sb) and BCDs\n(1 region).\nInterestingly, no strong correlation is observed between the number of regions detected\nwithin an object and the distance to the galaxy. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient\nfor these parameters is 0.2, with a two-sided significance level of its deviation from 0 of\n4 \u00d7 10\u22122 . This indicates that, with our definition of star-forming knots, spatial resolution is\nnot a major factor in the number of star-forming knots detected for the range of distances\ncovered by the UCM galaxies. In contrast, the number of regions and the apparent size\nof the entire galaxy (taken as the radius of the 24.5 mag arcsec\u22122 isophote) do show some\ncorrelation: larger galaxies tend to have more star-forming regions. The Spearman's rank\ncorrelation coefficient of these quantities is 0.48 and the two-sided significance level of its\ndeviation from 0 is 7 \u00d7 10\u22126 . In addition, those galaxies with large numbers of regions are\nalso more luminous than objects with fewer knots of star formation.\nThe median radius of the star-forming knots in the UCM galaxies is 0.5 kpc, which\nis approximately twice the average resolution (cf. Section 3.5.1). The smallest detected\nknot has a radius of \u223c 100 pc. The starburst complexes can be as large as 4 kpc. The\nmost extreme cases are found in UCM1513+2012 and UCM2250+2427, two very disturbed\ngalaxies.\n\nRd\nThe emission measure EM , whose units are pc cm\u22126 , is defined as EM = 0 Ne2 ds, where Ne is the\nelectron density and the integral extends to the line of sight. For an electron temperature of T = 104 K,\nEM = 4.908 \u00d7 1017 I(H\u03b1), where I(H\u03b1) is the intensity in erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 arcsec\u22122.\n6\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- Frequency distributions and correlations of the properties of the star-forming\nknots detected in the UCM sample. Areas are in kpc2 , SFRs in M\u2299 yr\u22121 , and \u03a3max\nSFR in\n\u22121\n\u22122\nM\u2299 yr kpc . Panels show: a) Histograms of the area of the individual star-forming\nknots (Areai , in gray) and the total extension of the H\u03b1 emission (AreaT ).

Median values and\nquartiles of the entire distribution and different spectroscopic types are marked. And f) \u03a3max\nSFR\nvs. SFRi for the detected star-forming knots in the UCM sample.\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\nUsing the conversion factor given in Equation 3 we have also calculated global SFRs\n(SFRT ), average SFR surface densities (\u03a3SFR ), and maximum SFR surface densities (\u03a3max\nSFR ,\nthe SFR surface density of the pixel with the highest intensity) for each of the regions.\nThe gray histogram in Figure 9(a) shows the frequency distribution of the surface areas\nof the individual star-forming knots. The projected areas range from 0.05 to 50 kpc2 . The\ndistribution peaks at \u223c 1 kpc2 , with a median value of 0.9 kpc2 . The frequency distribution\nof the total area of the H\u03b1-emitting regions in each galaxy is also shown (empty histogram).\nThis distribution presents a peak at \u223c 14 kpc2 . Median values for the different morphological\nand spectroscopic types are marked. A trend is observed in the sense that later Hubble\ntypes have larger active star-forming areas. As expected for their dwarf nature, BCDs are\ncharacterized by the small extension of the burst zone. On the contrary, the objects that\nwere classified as highly-disturbed interacting systems present the most extended bursts (the\nmedian is 27 kpc2 ). From a spectroscopic point of view, disk-like galaxies show emitting total\nareas which are twice the size of those of HII-like objects.\nFigure 9(b) shows the correlation between the total area covered by the H\u03b1 emission\nand the SFR of the galaxy (open circles). Data for the individual regions in each galaxy is\nalso shown as dots joined by a line. The total area covered by star-formation is each galaxy\nis reasonably well correlated to the total SFR, and the logarithmic slope of the relation is\nclose to 1. This indicates that the range in global SFR surface densities is relatively narrow\nfor all the galaxies in the UCM sample. Indeed, the median value of the total SFR per unit\nstar-forming area in the UCM sample is 0.15 M\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 , with an rms of only 0.4dex.\nNote that since these numbers have not been corrected for inclination, the intrinsic scatter\nis probably smaller. Interestingly, we also find the most extended individual knots in the\nmost actively star-forming galaxies (see discussion of Figure 9(d) below).\nFigure 9(c) shows the frequency distribution of the SFRs estimated for the individual\nregions. Median values for the global distribution and for each morphological and spectroscopic types are shown. There is, again, a clear trend with morphology for the spiral\ngalaxies: later types have more intense star-forming knots than earlier spirals. BCDs are\nsegregated from the rest of the galaxies since they tend to have the brightest star-forming\nregions. Somewhat surprisingly, irregular and interacting galaxies seem to have star-forming\nregions with lower individual SFRs, but since, as we found before, they tend to have large\nnumbers of them, their global SFRs can still be high. The star-forming knots in disk-like\ngalaxies are also more intense (by a factor of a few) than those found in HII-like objects.\nThis seems to suggest two different star-formation regimes operate in 'quiescent' objects\n(e.g., normal spirals) and disturbed/interacting objects.\nFigure 9(d) shows that high integrated H\u03b1 emission in a galaxy is accompanied by the\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\nexistence of more intense individual star-forming regions. This trend may be explained in\npart by an statistical effect. If the frequency distribution shown in figure 9(c) is sampled\nrandomly in each galaxy, the most intense star-forming knots would tend to appear in galaxies\nwith large SFRs. In some cases, galaxies with low SFR will be completely dominated by\none single burst. However, if two different star-formation regimes operate in disturbed\nand 'quiescent' galaxies, this simple statistical explanation would be complicated by the\npossible existence of different frequency distributions for the different star-formation modes.\nMoreover, simple statistics do not provide the whole story. In a significant fraction of the\ngalaxies where multiple star-forming knots are found, the global star formation is completely\ndominated by one of them (often the central/nuclear one; cf. section 3.2). Obviously, this\nalso contributes to the observed correlation.\nFinally, figure 9(f) presents the tight correlation existing between the SFR of individual\nstar-forming knots and their maximum \u03a3SFR . A similar behaviour is observed between the\naverage \u03a3SFR of each knot and the total SFR, though a larger scatter is found. The values\nof the maximum \u03a3SFR that we find are lower than the maximum limit found for starbursts\nby Meurer et al. (1997), which is consistent with the fact that most of our galaxies are not\nextreme starbursts. We observe no correlation between \u03a3max\nSFR (or \u03a3SFR ) and morphological\ntype.\nSummarizing the results shown in figure 9, the most intense star-forming knots present\nthe highest SFR surface densities and largest sizes. These properties eventually translate\ninto a larger global H\u03b1 emission for the entire galaxy. High-resolution studies have also\nfound this correlation between the global SFR and the number and mass of the individual\nstar-forming knots (see Kennicutt 1998a, and references therein). Even though these trends\napply to the vast majority of the UCM galaxies, we also find suggestive evidence that a\ndifferent star-formation mode could be operating in the irregular/interacting galaxies in our\nsample.\n\n3.5.3. Diffuse H\u03b1 emission\nWe have followed two different approaches when separating the diffuse ionized gas (DIG)\nemission from the star-forming knots. First, we used an absolute surface brightness cutoff\nvalue that corresponds to the faintest emission that we considered to be part of a starformation knot in the previous section (1.32\u00d710\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 arcsec\u22122 ). Such an approach\ndoes not deal with spatial variations of the DIG intensity within a galaxy or from one object\nto another. For that reason, we have also used a more elaborated detection technique\nthat takes into consideration distinctive properties of the DIG such as its diffuseness or\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\nits morphology. Following Zurita (2001), we have built gradient maps of the H\u03b1 flux to\nselect the zones presenting the lowest spatial variations of the emission. These zones were\nidentified with the diffuse ionized gas. The selected upper limits of the intensity gradient\nthat we used are very similar to the values used by Zurita (2001): the median for our sample\nis 45 pc cm\u22126 arcsec\u22121 and Zurita used 44 pc cm\u22126 arcsec\u22121 . We will discuss the results\nobtained with both methods in this section.\nUsing both detection methods, diffuse emission has been detected in all but 5 galaxies\nfor an upper intensity cutoff of 65 pc cm\u22126 . The median intensity of the DIG is 46 pc cm\u22126 .\nThis value is typical of the brightest component of the DIG observed in nearby galaxies (3-5\ntimes larger than the averages given in Hoopes et al. 1996 and Zurita 2001).\nThe comparison of the flux arising from the diffuse ionized gas and the total H\u03b1 emission of the galaxy provides a useful diagnostic of the escape of Lyman photons from HII\nregions. These photons may ionize the gas in the disks of the galaxies or even escape to\nthe intergalactic medium. In both cases, it would be necessary to revise the assumptions\nmade when linking the measured emission from HII regions to SFR, and when dealing with\ninteraction between active star formation and the interstellar and intergalactic medium.\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.- Median contribution of the different intensity levels of the H\u03b1 emission to the\ntotal flux for the galaxies in the UCM sample (left panel). The flux fraction (vertical axis)\nrefers to the contribution to the total flux of the emission regions with an intensity below a\ngiven surface brightness cutoff (horizontal axis). The median value for the entire sample at\neach cutoff intensity is shown (thick line) together with the upper and lower quartiles (thin\nline). The inset plot depicts the same flux ratio against the SFR surface density levels. For\ncomparison, the \u03a3SFR limit for the survey of z \u223c 0.24 galaxies published by Pascual et al.\n(2001) is marked with a dotted line (see text). The right panel presents the histogram of the\nDIG fraction of the total flux (calculated using the pixels whose intensity is over the global\ndetection limit) for an EM cutoff of 65 pc cm\u22126 (empty histogram). The gray histogram\nshows the same fraction but corrected for the DIG over-imposed in the star-forming knots.\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\nIn order to characterize the DIG in the UCM galaxies, the contribution to the total flux\nof the emission zones with an intensity below a certain surface brightness cutoff has been\nmeasured. Figure 10 plots this quantity against the cutoff intensity. The median values for\nthe 79 galaxies in our sample are shown, together with the first and third quartiles. The\nupper cutoff value for the DIG (65 pc cm\u22126 ) is shown.\nThe right panel of Figure 10 shows a histogram of the fractional contribution of the DIG\nto the H\u03b1 fluxes. Individual values range from 0% to 34% (UCM1308+2950). On average,\n8% of the total H\u03b1 flux of a UCM galaxy comes from pixels that were identified as DIG.\nOnly pixels with fluxes over the global detection limit were used in this calculation.\nWhen using the gradient method explained above to detect the DIG emission, we get\nvery similar results. These figures are consistent with previous studies on the DIG properties\n(e.g, Hoopes et al. 1996; Wang et al. 1999; Zurita 2001) and on the escape of Lyman photons\nfrom HII regions (Oey & Kennicutt 1997).\nThese results do not take into account the effects of the light scattered by the dust in the\ngalaxies or by the optics of the telescope. The correction for these effects has been estimated\nto be 5\u201315% of the diffuse flux by Hoopes et al. (1996). In addition, the fluxes in Figure 10\n(left panel) do not contain the contribution of the DIG located in the line of sight of the\nstar-forming regions, i.e., superimposed on them. We have estimated the correction factor\nfor this effect by substituting the intensity of the pixels belonging to a star-forming knot by\nthe average value of the detected DIG pixels. This correction rises the DIG contribution to\nthe total flux by a factor of \u223c 2. These factors are consistent with the ones found by Hoopes\net al. (1996). The histogram for the flux fraction of the DIG corrected for these effects has\nalso been plotted in the right panel of Figure 10 (gray histogram).\nWe do not find large differences between the flux fraction of the DIG for different\nmorphologies. If anything, Sa galaxies show a somewhat lower fraction (\u223c 10%, including\nthe corrections mentioned above) when compared with later Hubble types (20%). Interacting\nsystems and BCDs present somewhat lower fractions. For the different spectroscopic classes,\nwe find that disk-like galaxies show larger fractions (\u223c 20%) than HII-like objects (less than\n10%).\nImaging surveys of galaxies at intermediate and high redshifts are able to detect emissionline objects to a certain flux limit which can be expressed in units of SFR surface density\n(M\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 ). This obviously means that objects that are fainter than that limit are not\ndetected. But even for objects that are detected, a significant fraction of the total flux may\nbe under the detection limit and thus missed. To estimate how important this effect may be,\nwe have calculated the ratio of the luminosity arising from regions with a SFR surface density\n\n\f\u2013 35 \u2013\nbelow a given cutoff value to the integrated luminosity, i.e., the cumulative contribution of\nthe different SFR surface density levels to the total SFR. Here we have calculated the total\nemission for these objects adding the flux in all pixels above the detection limit. The inset\nin Figure 10 shows the results of this calculation. Under the assumption that the distant\ngalaxies under consideration are comparable to the UCM galaxies in their star formation\nproperties and spatial distribution, this plot gives a correction to the detected luminosity for\neach detection limit. As an example we refer to the survey of z \u223c 0.24 H\u03b1 emitting galaxies\npublished by Pascual et al. (2001). The faintest galaxy in this survey has an H\u03b1 luminosity\nof 3.4 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121 measured in a circular aperture of 1.6\u2032\u2032 or \u223c 100 kpc2 . This turns into\nan average SFR surface density of \u223c 0.02 M\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 , which is shown in Figure 10. If\nwe assume this value as the detection limit, this figure reveals that the survey was missing\nabout 20% of the total H\u03b1 flux in pixels with an intensity below the detection limit. Similar\ncorrections may be calculated for other surveys.\n\n3.6.\n\nH\u03b1 luminosity function and the SFR density of the Universe\n\nThe integrated luminosities measured in the H\u03b1 images can be used to recalculate the\nluminosity function and the star formation rate density of the local Universe first published\nby Gallego et al. (1995). In that paper, the H\u03b1 fluxes measured in the spectra were converted\nto luminosities after an aperture correction. This correction assumed that the EW (H\u03b1) was\nconstant over the whole galaxy, and used integrated Gunn-r magnitudes and the spectroscopic EW (H\u03b1) values to estimate H\u03b1 luminosities. We compare these luminosities with\nthe ones measured in the H\u03b1 images in Figure 11. In the inset of that figure we also present\nthe histograms of the frequency distributions of the imaging and spectroscopic luminosities\n(empty and gray histograms respectively). Median values and upper/lower quartiles are\nindicated.\nWe find that, statistically, the luminosities estimated from the spectroscopic data worked\nquite well. On average, the aperture-corrected spectroscopic data underestimated the total\nemission of the UCM Survey galaxies by \u2243 10% only (the corresponding median value\nis 30%). However, Figure 11 shows that on an individual galaxy basis, the spectroscopic\nestimates can be off by factors of up to a few. Note that galaxy sizes are not the determinant factor on the accuracy of the aperture correction. The key factor is how valid the\nspectroscopically-determined EW (H\u03b1) value is for the whole galaxy.\n\n\f\u2013 36 \u2013\n\nFig. 11.- Comparison of the H\u03b1 luminosities obtained from spectroscopy (aperture corrected) and imaging. The dashed lines correspond to factors of 5, 2, 1/2 and 1/5. The\ninset plot shows the frequency histograms for the imaging (empty) and spectroscopic (gray)\nluminosities.\n\n\f\u2013 37 \u2013\nWe have now recalculated the H\u03b1 luminosity function and the SFR density of the local\nUniverse using the imaging-based luminosities corrected for internal extinction. We have\nassumed that the galaxies in our H\u03b1 imaging sample are a fair subsample of the entire UCM\nsurvey with regard to their H\u03b1 luminosities (cf. section Section 2), and we have followed the\nsame techniques of the original work of Gallego et al. (1995). For direct comparison with the\nspectroscopic study, this analysis is carried out for a cosmology with H0 = 50 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ,\n\u03a9M = 1 and \u039b = 0 as well as for the cosmology used elsewhere in this paper (H0 = 70;\n\u03a9M = 0.3; \u039b = 0.7). Using the V /Vmax method (Schmidt 1968; Huchra & Sargent 1973), the\nSchechter parameters of the best fit are:\n(H0 = 50, \u03a9M = 1.0, \u039b = 0.0)\n\u03b1 = \u22121.1 \u00b1 0.2\n\n(H0 = 70, \u03a9M = 0.3, \u039b = 0.7)\n\u03b1 = \u22121.2 \u00b1 0.2\n\n\u03c6\u2217 = 10 \u22123.3\u00b10.2 Mpc\u22123\n\n\u03c6\u2217 = 10 \u22123.0\u00b10.2 Mpc\u22123\n\nL\u2217 = 1042.60\u00b10.20 erg s\u22121\n\nL\u2217 = 1042.43\u00b10.17 erg s\u22121\n\nSimilar results (within the uncertainties) have been obtained using the two more sophisticated luminosity function estimators developed by Sandage et al. (1979) and Efstathiou\net al. (1988). The main difference found with the spectroscopic results is that the characteristic H\u03b1 luminosity L\u2217 of a local star-forming galaxy is a factor of \u223c 3 brighter in the\nimaging-based study than in the spectroscopic one. The reason for this appears to be that\nthe H\u03b1 images have revealed that several large and H\u03b1-bright objects had their luminosities\nunderestimated by the spectroscopic data because their star formation was mainly located\naway from the nuclear regions sampled by the slits (cf. figure 11). Similar results have been\nfound recently by Serjeant et al. (2002), based on radio observations.\nThe total H\u03b1 luminosity density of the local Universe can be calculated by integrating\nthe luminosity function for all luminosities. This yields values of 1039.3\u00b10.2 erg s\u22121 Mpc\u22123\n(H0 = 50; \u03a9M = 1; \u039b = 0) and 1039.5\u00b10.2 erg s\u22121 Mpc\u22123 for the 'concordance cosmology'. For\na fixed cosmology, the imaging-based density is \u223c 60% (0.2dex) larger than the spectroscopic\none of Gallego et al. (1995), but note that the formal uncertainty in the measured value is\nalso 0.2dex.\nUsing the transformation from L(H\u03b1) to SFR given in Equation 3, we obtain the SFR\n\u22121\ndensity of the local Universe: \u03c1SF R = 0.016+0.007\nMpc\u22123 (H0 = 50; \u03a9M = 1; \u039b = 0)\n\u22120.004 M\u2299 yr\n\u22121\nand \u03c1SF R = 0.029+0.008\nMpc\u22123 (H0 = 70; \u03a9M = 0.3; \u039b = 0.7)7 .\n\u22120.005 M\u2299 yr\n7\n\n\u03a9M\n\nNote that the value of the SFR density given in Gallego et al. (1995) (0.013 M\u2299 yr\u22121 Mpc\u22123 for H0 = 50;\n= 1; \u039b = 0) was obtained with a different transformation factor from H\u03b1 luminosity to SFR, so the\n\n\f\u2013 38 \u2013\n4.\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nIn this paper we have presented H\u03b1 images for a statistically-representative subsample\nof 79 local star-forming galaxies. This sample has been selected from the UCM Survey galaxies ensuring that the distributions of H\u03b1 luminosities, equivalent widths and spectroscopic\ntypes are representative of the entire survey. The observations, data reduction and analysis\nhave been described, and we have presented results concerning galaxy properties such as\ntheir concentration, bulge and disk emission, relationship between newly-formed stars and\nunderlying older population, distribution of star-forming knots and properties of the diffuse\nemission. We have also discussed the implications of our imaging survey on the determination of the local H\u03b1 luminosity function and star formation rate density. The main results\nof this work are:\n1.\u2013 Typical long-slit or fiber spectroscopic observations of nearby galaxies such as those\nin the UCM sample (hzi = 0.026) can miss substantial fractions of the emission-line\nflux (typically 50%\u201370%). Thus, to avoid applying uncertain aperture corrections,\ndirect emission-line imaging (e.g., narrow-band H\u03b1 imaging) can provide useful and\ncomplementary information to spectroscopy.\n2.\u2013 The average concentration parameter c31 (Gavazzi et al. 1990) of the UCM Survey\ngalaxies is typical of disk dominated galaxies. Its distribution peaks at c31 \u223c 3. The\naverage size of the emission regions is \u223c 1.5 kpc, but this size correlates with morphology in the sense that late-type spirals have significantly larger H\u03b1-emitting regions\nthan early types. On average, the star formation event covers half of the total size of\nthese galaxies.\n3.\u2013 Using a technique akin to bulge/disk decomposition for the H\u03b1 radial distribution\nwe have robustly separated the contribution to the total emission into nuclear and\ndisk components. On average, a UCM galaxy harbors a star formation event with a\nnuclear component contributing 30% of its line emission. A significant disk emission\ncomponent is detected in the vast majority of the galaxies, including objects that were\nspectroscopically classified as starburst nuclei.\n4.\u2013 In contrast with previous studies, we do not find a correlation between the H\u03b1 equivalent width and Hubble type for spirals. This may be a consequence of the enhanced\nstar-forming activity of the UCM galaxies (H\u03b1-selected) with respect to broad-band\nvalues are not directly comparable. The correct comparison needs to be carried out for the H\u03b1 luminosity\ndensities, as we have done above.\n\n\f\u2013 39 \u2013\nselected ones: our sample is dominated by high-EW (H\u03b1) galaxies. Disk-like galaxies\npresent considerable lower values of the EW (H\u03b1) (24 \u00c5) than HII-like objects (75 \u00c5).\nThis suggests that the underlying older stellar population in disk-like galaxies has a\nlarger relative contribution to the galaxy luminosity than in HII-like objects.\n5.\u2013 A positive correlation between the SFR and the extinction has been found, although the\ncorrelation seems to saturate for heavily-obscured objects (H\u03b1/H\u03b2 & 7 corresponding\nto E(B \u2212 V ) & 0.9). This suggests that in objects with very high extinction a large\nfraction of the SFR could be completely hidden by dust with the Balmer line ratio\nonly tracing those regions with the lowest (but still high) extinction.\n6.\u2013 The most intense star-forming knots in the UCM galaxies present the highest SFR\nsurface densities and largest sizes. Moreover, the brightest and largest star-forming\nknots are found in galaxies with the highest H\u03b1 luminosities. We have also found\nsome evidence for the existence of two different star-formation regimes operating in\n'quiescent' objects (e.g., normal spirals) and disturbed/interacting/irregular objects:\nthe latter seem to have, on average, star-forming regions with lower individual SFRs,\nbut larger numbers of them so that their global SFRs can still be relatively high.\n7.\u2013 About 15\u201330% of the total H\u03b1 flux of a typical UCM galaxy comes from a diffuse\nionized gas component. This percentage seems to be independent of the Hubble type.\n8.\u2013 The present H\u03b1 imaging study has led to the recalculation of the H\u03b1 luminosity function and star formation rate density of the local Universe. Our results yield an H\u03b1 luminosity density in the local Universe of 1039.3\u00b10.2 erg s\u22121 Mpc\u22123 (H0 = 50; \u03a9M = 1; \u039b =\n0) and 1039.5\u00b10.2 erg s\u22121 Mpc\u22123 (H0 = 70; \u03a9M = 0.3; \u039b = 0.7). For a fixed cosmology,\nthese values are 60% larger than the densities calculated in Gallego et al. (1995). These\n\u22121\nluminosity densities translate into SFR densities of \u03c1SF R = 0.016+0.007\nMpc\u22123\n\u22120.004 M\u2299 yr\n+0.008\n(H0 = 50; \u03a9M = 1; \u039b = 0) and \u03c1SF R = 0.029\u22120.005 M\u2299 yr\u22121 Mpc\u22123 (H0 = 70;\n\u03a9M = 0.3; \u039b = 0.7).\n\nPGPG wishes to acknowledge the Spanish Ministry of Education and Culture for the\nreception of a Formaci\u00f3n de Profesorado Universitario fellowship.
