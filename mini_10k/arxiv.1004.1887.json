The appearance changes in face occur either due to\nintrinsic and extrinsic factors and due to these changes, face recognition problems\nbecome ill posed and difficult to authenticate faces with outmost ease. Auxiliary\ncomplexities like the facial attributes compatibility complexity, data dimensionality\nproblem, the motion of face parts, facial expression changes, pose changes, partly\n\n\f2\nPhalguni Gupta1, Dakshina Ranjan Kisku2, Jamuna Kanta Sing3, Massimo\nTistarelli4\n\nocclusion and illumination changes cause major changes in appearance. In order to\nmake the problem well-posed, vision researchers have adapted and applied an\nabundance of algorithms for pattern classification, recognition and learning.\nThere exist the appearance-based techniques which include Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA) [1], Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) [1], Fisher Discriminant\nAnalysis (FDA) [1] and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [1]. Some local\nfeature based methods are also investigated [4-5]. A local feature-based technique for\nface recognition, called Elastic Bunch Graph Matching (EBGM) has been proposed in\n[3]. EBGM is used to represent faces as graphs and the vertices localized at fiducial\npoints (e.g., eyes, nose) and the geometric distances or edges labeled with the\ndistances between the vertices. Each vertex contains a set known as Gabor Jet, of 40\ncomplex Gabor wavelet coefficients at different scales and orientations. In case of\nidentification, these constructed graphs are searched and get one face that maximizes\nthe graph similarity function. There exists another graph-based technique in [6] which\nperforms face recognition and identification by graph matching topology drawn on\nSIFT features [7-8]. Since the SIFT features are invariant to rotation, scaling and\ntranslation, the face projections are represented by graphs and faces can be matched\nonto new face by maximizing a similarity function taking into account spatial\ndistortions and the similarities of the local features.\nThis paper addresses the problem of capturing the face variations in terms of face\ncharacteristics by incorporating probabilistic graphs drawn on SIFT features extracted\nfrom dynamic (mouth) and static (eyes, nose) salient facial parts. Differences in facial\nexpression, head pose changes, illumination changes, and partly occlusion, result\nvariations in facial characteristics and attributes. Therefore, to combat with these\nproblems, invariant feature descriptor SIFT is used for the proposed graph matching\nalgorithm for face recognition which is devised pair-wise manner to salient facial\nparts (e.g., eyes, mouth, nose).\nThe goal of the proposed algorithm is to perform an efficient and cost effective\nface recognition by matching probabilistic graph drawn on SIFT features whereas the\nSIFT features [7] are extracted from local salient parts of face images and directly\nrelated to the face geometry. In this regard, a face-matching technique, based on\nlocally derived graph on facial landmarks (e.g., eye, nose, mouth) is presented with\nthe fusion of graphs in terms of the fusion of salient features. In the local matching\nstrategy, SIFT keypoint features are extracted from face images in the areas\ncorresponding to facial landmarks such as eyes, nose and mouth. Facial landmarks are\nautomatically located by means of a standard facial landmark detection algorithm [89]. Then matching a pair of graphs drawn on SIFT features is performed by searching\na most probable pair of probabilistic graphs from a pair of salient landmarks. This\npaper also proposes a local fusion approach where the matching scores obtained from\neach pair of salient features are fused together using the Dempster-Shafer decision\ntheory. The proposed technique is evaluated with two face databases, viz. the IIT\nKanpur and the ORL (formerly known as AT&T) databases [11] and the results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.\nThe paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses SIFT features\nextraction and probabilistic graph matching for face recognition. Experimental results\nare presented in Section 3 and conclusion is given in the last section.\n\n\fMaximized Posteriori Attributes Selection from Facial Salient Landmarks for Face\nRecognition\n3\n\n2 SIFT Feature Extraction and Probabilistic Matching\n\n2.1 SIFT Keypoint Descriptor for Representation\nThe basic idea of the SIFT descriptor [6-7] is detecting feature points efficiently\nthrough a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in the scale-space.\nLocal feature points are extracted by searching peaks in the scale-space from a\ndifference of Gaussian (DoG) function. The feature points are localized using the\nmeasurement of their stability and orientations are assigned based on local image\nproperties. Finally, the feature descriptors which represent local shape distortions and\nillumination changes, are determined.\n\n50\n\n50\n\n100\n\n100\n\n150\n\n150\n\n200\n\n200\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nFig. 1. Invariant SIFT Feature Extraction on a pair of Face Images\n\nEach feature point is composed of four types of information \u2013 spatial location (x,\ny), scale (S), orientation (\u03b8) and Keypoint descriptor (K). For the sake of the\nexperimental evaluation, only the keypoint descriptor [6-7] has been taken into\naccount. This descriptor consists of a vector of 128 elements representing the\norientations within a local neighborhood. In Figure 1, the SIFT features extracted\nfrom a pair of face images are shown.\n2.2 Local Salient Landmarks Representation with Keypoint Features\nDeformable objects are generally difficult to characterize with a rigid representation\nin feature spaces for recognition. With a large view of physiological characteristics in\nbiometrics including iris, fingerprint, hand geometry, etc, faces are considered as\nhighly deformable objects. Different facial regions, not only convey different relevant\nand redundant information on the subject's identity, but also suffer from different\n\n\f4\nPhalguni Gupta1, Dakshina Ranjan Kisku2, Jamuna Kanta Sing3, Massimo\nTistarelli4\n\ntime variability either due to motion or illumination changes. A typical example is the\ncase of a talking face where the mouth part can be considered as dynamic facial\nlandmark part. Again the eyes and nose can be considered as the static facial\nlandmark parts which are almost still and invariant over time. Moreover, the mouth\nmoves changing its appearance over time. As a consequence, the features extracted\nfrom the mouth area cannot be directly matched with the corresponding features from\na static template. Moreover, single facial features may be occluded making the\ncorresponding image area not usable for identification. For these reasons to improve\nthe identification and recognition process, a method is performed which searches the\nmatching features from a pair of facial landmarks correspond to a pair of faces by\nmaximizing the posteriori probability among the keypoints features. The aim of the\nproposed matching technique is to correlate the extracted SIFT features with\nindependent facial landmarks. The SIFT descriptors are extracted and grouped\ntogether by searching the sub-graph attributes and drawing the graphs at locations\ncorresponding to static (eyes, nose) and dynamic (mouth) facial positions.\nThe eyes and mouth positions are automatically located by applying the technique\nproposed in [8]. The position of nostrils is automatically located by applying the\ntechnique proposed in [9]. A circular region of interest (ROI), centered at each\nextracted facial landmark location, is defined to determine the SIFT features to be\nconsidered as belonging to each face area.\nSIFT feature points are then extracted from these four regions and gathered\ntogether into four groups. Then another four groups are formed by searching the\ncorresponding keypoints using iterative relaxation algorithm by establishing relational\nprobabilistic graphs [12] on the four salient landmarks of probe face.\n2.3 Probabilistic Interpretation of Facial Landmarks\nIn order to interpret the facial landmarks with invariant SIFT points and probabilistic\ngraphs, each extracted feature can be thought as a node and the relationship between\ninvariant points can be considered as geometric distance between the nodes. At the\nlevel of feature extraction, invariant SIFT feature points are extracted from the face\nimages and the facial landmarks are localized using the landmark detection algorithms\ndiscussed in [8], [9]. These facial landmarks are used to define probabilistic graph\nwhich is further used to make correspondence and matching between two faces.\nTo measure the similarity of vertices and edges (geometric distances) for a pair of\ngraphs [12] drawn on two different facial landmarks of a pair of faces, we need to\nmeasure the similarity for node and edge attributes correspond to keypoint descriptors\nand geometric relationship attributes among the keypoints features. Let, two graphs be\nG ' = {N ' , E ' , K ' , \u03c2 '} and G ' ' = {N ' ' , E ' ' , K ' ' , \u03c2 ' '} where N', E', K', \u03b6' denote nodes,\nedges, association between nodes and association between edges respectively.\nTherefore, we can denote the similarity measure for nodes n'i \u2208 N ' and n' ' j \u2208 N ' ' by\n\ns n ij = s (k 'i , k ' ' j ) and the similarity between edges e'ip \u2208 E ' and e' ' jq \u2208 E ' ' can be\ndenoted by s\n\ne\n\nipjq\n\n= s (e'ip , e' ' jq ) .\n\n\fMaximized Posteriori Attributes Selection from Facial Salient Landmarks for Face\nRecognition\n5\n\nFurther, suppose,\nrespectively. Now,\n\nn'i and n' ' j are vertices in gallery graph and probe graph,\n\nn' ' j would be best probable match for n'i when n' ' j maximizes the\n\nposteriori probability [12] of labeling. Thus for the vertex n'i \u2208 N ' , we are searching\nthe most probable label or vertex n 'i = n' ' j \u2208 N ' ' in the probe graph. Hence, it can be\nstated as\n\nn ' i = arg max P (\u03c8 i\n\nn '' j\n\nj , n '' j \u2208 N ''\n\n| K ',\u03c2 ', K ' ',\u03c2 ' ' )\n\n(1)\n\nTo simplify the solution of matching problem, we adopt a relaxation technique that\nefficiently searching the matching probabilities P\n\nn\n\nij\n\nn'i \u2208 N ' and\n\nfor vertices\n\nn' ' j \u2208 N ' ' . By reformulating Equation (1) can be written as\nn ' i = arg max P\n\nn\n\nj , n '' j \u2208 N ''\n\n(2)\n\nij\n\nThis relaxation procedure considers as an iterative algorithm for searching the best\nlabels for n 'i . This can be achieved by assigning prior probabilities P\nto s\n\nn\n\nij\n\nn\n\nij\n\nproportional\n\n= s (k 'i , k ' ' j ) . Then the iterative relaxation rule would be\nn\n\n\u2211\n\nP\n\nq ,n n q \u2208 N\n\n\u220f\n\nQ ij = p n ij\n\np , n ' p \u2208 N 'i q , n\n\nRelaxation\n\ncycles\n\nare\n\n(3)\n\nP n ij .Q ij\n\nP\u02c6 n ij =\n\nrepeated\n\nn\n\nn\n\niq\n\n.Q iq\n\nn\n\n\u2211s\nn\n\nq \u2208N\n\nn\n\nuntil\n\ne\n\nipjq\n\n(4)\n\n.P n pq\n\nj\n\nthe\n\ndifference\n\nbetween\n\nprior\n\nn\n\nprobabilities P ij and posteriori probabilities P\u0302 ij becomes smaller than certain\nthreshold \u03a6 and when this is reached then it is assumed that the relaxation process is\nstable. Therefore,\n\nmax\n\ni ,n 'i \u2208N ', j , n '' j \u2208N ''\n\nP n ij \u2212 P\u02c6 n ij < \u03a6\n\n(5)\n\nHence, the matching between a pair of graphs is established by using the posteriori\nprobabilities in Equation (2) about assigning the labels from the gallery graph G ' to\nthe points on the probe graph G ' ' .\nFrom these groups pair-wise salient feature matching is performed in terms of\ngraph matching. Finally, the matching scores obtained from these group pairs are\n\n\f6\nPhalguni Gupta1, Dakshina Ranjan Kisku2, Jamuna Kanta Sing3, Massimo\nTistarelli4\n\nfused together by the Dempster-Shafer fusion rule [10] and the fused score is\ncompared against a threshold for final decision.\n\n3 Experimental Evaluation\nTo investigate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed graph-based face\nmatching strategy, experiments are carried out on the IITK face database and the ORL\nface database [11]. The IITK face database consists of 1200 face images with four\nimages per person (300X4), which have captured in control environment with \u00b120\ndegree changes of head pose and with almost uniform lighting and illumination\nconditions, and the facial expressions keeping consistent with some ignorable\nchanges. For the face matching, all probe images are matched against all target\nimages. On the other hand, the ORL face database consists of 400 images taken from\n40 subjects. Out of these 400 images, we use 200 face images for experiment, in\nwhich \u00b120 to \u00b130 degrees orientation changes have been considered. The face images\nshow variations of pose and facial expression (smile/not smile, open/closed eyes).\nWhen the faces have been taken, the original resolution is 92 x 112 pixels for each\none. However, for our experiment we set the resolution as 140\u00d7100 pixels in line with\nIITK database.\nROC Curves Determined from ORL and IITK Face Database\n100\n\n<--- Genuine Acceptance Rate --->\n\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n0\n10\n\nROC curve for ORL face database\nROC curve for IITK face database\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n<--- False Acceptance Rate --->\n\nFig. 2. ROC curves for the proposed matching algorithm for ORL and IITK databases.\n\nThe ROC curves of the error rates obtained from the face matching applied to the\nface databases are shown in Figure 2. The computed recognition accuracy for the\nIITK database is 93.63% and for the ORL database is 97.33%. The relative accuracy\nof the proposed matching strategy for ORL database increases of about 3% over the\n\n\fMaximized Posteriori Attributes Selection from Facial Salient Landmarks for Face\nRecognition\n7\n\nIITK database. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed face matching\nalgorithm for recognition and identification, we compare our algorithm with the\nalgorithms that are discussed in [6], [13], [14], and [15]. There are several face\nmatching algorithms discussed in the literatures which tested on different face\ndatabases or with different processes. It is duly unavailable of such uniform\nexperimental environment, where the experiments can be performed with multiple\nattributes and characteristics. By extensive comparison, we have found that, the\nproposed algorithm is solely different from the algorithms in [6], [13], [14], [15] in\nterms of performance and design issues. In [13], the PCA approach discussed for\ndifferent view of face images without transformation and the algorithm achieved 90%\nrecognition accuracy for some specific views of faces. On the other hand, [14] and\n[15] use Gabor jets for face processing and recognition where the first one has used\nthe Gabor jets without transformation and later one has used the Gabor jets with\ngeometrical transformation. Both the techniques are tested on Bochum and FERET\ndatabases which are characteristically different from the IITK and the ORL face\ndatabases and the recognition rates are 94% and 96%, respectively at maximum,\nwhile all the possible testing are done with different recognition rates. Also, another\ntwo graph based face recognition techniques drawn on SIFT features have been\ndiscussed in [6] where the graph matching algorithms are developed by considering\nthe whole face instead of the local landmark areas. The proposed face recognition\nalgorithm not only devised keypoints from the local landmarks, but it also combines\nthe local features for robust performance.\n\n4 Conclusion\nThis paper has proposed an efficient and robust face recognition techniques by\nconsidering facial landmarks and using the probabilistic graphs drawn on SIFT\nfeature points. During the face recognition process, the human faces are characterized\non the basis of local salient landmark features (e.g., eyes, mouth, nose). It has been\ndetermined that when the face matching accomplishes with the whole face region, the\nglobal features (whole face) are easy to capture and they are generally less\ndiscriminative than localized features. On contrary, local features on the face can be\nhighly discriminative, but may suffer for local changes in the facial appearance or\npartial face occlusion. In the proposed face recognition method, local facial landmarks\nare considered for further processing rather than global features. The optimal face\nrepresentation using probabilistic graphs drawn on local landmarks allow matching\nthe localized facial features efficiently by searching and making correspondence of\nkeypoints using iterative relaxation by keeping similarity measurement intact for face\nrecognition.\n\n\f8\nPhalguni Gupta1, Dakshina Ranjan Kisku2, Jamuna Kanta Sing3, Massimo\nTistarelli4\n\nReferences\n1.
