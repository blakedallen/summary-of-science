Introduction\nThe main purpose of this work is to approximate solutions of a nonlinear,\npossibly degenerate, reaction-diffusion equation of the form\n\u2202u\n= D\u2206(p(u)) + g(u)\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\nfor x \u2208 \u03a9 \u2286 Rd , d \u2265 1, t \u2265 0, with initial condition, u(x, 0) = u0 (x) and\nwith suitable boundary conditions, where the function p is a non-decreasing\nLipschitz continuous function defined on R. The equation is degenerate if\np(0) = 0 and in this case the solutions often become non-smooth in finite\ntime, developing fronts and discontinuities [1]. Finally, the coefficient D is\na diffusivity coefficient and the function g(u) is the reaction term.\nEquations like (1) are relevant in describing biological and physical processes and are involved in the modelling of population growth and dispersal,\n\n\fApril 1, 2019\n\n12:52\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nCavalliSemplice\n\n2\n\nof waves of concentration of chemical substances in living organisms, of the\nmotion of viscous fluids (see e.g. [2]). Also, systems of equations like (1),\ncoupled via the reaction terms, are capable of modelling the cyclic BelousovZhabotinskii reactions and the pattern formation on the wings of butterflies\nand the coat of mammals (see [3] and references therein).\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we introduce the relaxation approximation of nonlinear diffusion problems, in section 3 we describe the fully discrete relaxed numerical scheme in the reaction-diffusion\ncase. In section 4 we report several numerical tests, both in one and two\nspace dimensions.\n2. Relaxation approximation of nonlinear diffusion\nThe schemes proposed in the present work are based on the same framework of the well-known relaxation approximation of [4] for hyperbolic conservation laws. In the case of the nonlinear diffusion operator in (1), an\nadditional variable ~v (x, t) \u2208 Rd and a positive parameter \u03b5 are introduced\nand the following relaxation system is obtained:\n\uf8f1\n\u2202u\n\uf8f4\n+ div(~v ) = g(u)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u2202t\n(2)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n1\nD\n\u2202~v\n\uf8f4\n2\n2\n\uf8f3\n\u2207p(u)\n+ \u03c6 \u2207p(u) = \u2212 ~v + \u03c6 \u2212\n\u2202t\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n\nNow, formally, in the small relaxation limit, \u03b5 \u2192 0+ , system (2) approximates to leading order equation (1). The parameter \u03c6 is introduced in order\nto have bounded characteristic velocities and to avoid a singular differential\noperator as \u03b5 \u2192 0+ .\nFinally the non linearity in the convective term is removed, as in standard relaxation schemes, introducing another scalar variable w(x, t) and\nrewriting the system as:\n\uf8f1\n\u2202u\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n+ div(~v ) = g(u)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2202t\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\uf8f2 \u2202~v\n1\nD\n\u2207w\n+ \u03c62 \u2207w = \u2212 ~v + \u03c62 \u2212\n(3)\n\uf8f4\n\u2202t\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u2202w + div(~v ) = \u2212 1 (w \u2212 p(u))\n\u2202t\n\u03b5\nFormally, as \u03b5 \u2192 0+ , w \u2192 p(u), v \u2192 \u2212\u2207p(u) and the original equation is\nrecovered.\n\n\fApril 1, 2019\n\n12:52\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nCavalliSemplice\n\n3\n\nIn the previous system the parameter \u03b5 has physical dimensions of time\nand represents the so-called relaxation time. Furthermore, w has the same\ndimensions as u, while each component of ~v has the dimension of u times\na velocity; finally \u03c6 is a velocity. The inverse of \u03b5 gives the rate at which v\ndecays onto \u2212\u2207p(u) in the evolution of the variable ~v governed by the stiff\nsecond equation of (3).\nEquations (3), originally introduced in [5] for the purely diffusive case,\nform a semilinear hyperbolic system with a stiff source term. The characteristic velocities of the hyperbolic part are given by 0, \u00b1\u03c6. The parameter\n\u03c6 allows to move the stiff terms D\n\u03b5 \u2207p(u) to the right hand side, without\nlosing the hyperbolicity of the system.\nWe point out that degenerate parabolic equations often model physical\nsituations where free boundaries and discontinuities are relevant: we expect\nthat schemes for hyperbolic systems will be able to reproduce faithfully\nthese details of the solution. One of the main properties of (3) consists in the\nsemilinearity of the system, that is all the nonlinear terms are in the (stiff)\nsource terms, while the differential operator is linear. Hence, the solution of\nthe convective part requires neither Riemann solvers nor the computation\nof the characteristic structure at each time step, since the eigenstructure\nof the system is constant in time. Moreover, the relaxation approximation\ndoes not exploit the form of the nonlinear function p and hence it gives rise\nto a numerical scheme that, to a large extent, is independent of it, resulting\nin a very versatile tool.\nWe also anticipate here that, in the relaxed case (i.e. \u03b5 = 0), the stiff\nsource terms can be integrated solving a system that is already in triangular\nform and then it does not require iterative solvers.\n3. Relaxed numerical schemes\n3.1. Relaxed IMEX schemes\nWe extend here the schemes studied in [6], including the reaction term. For\nsimplicity, here we describe the one-dimensional case, the generalization\nbeing straightforward.\nWe observe that system (3) is in the form\n\u2202f (z)\n1\n\u2202z\n+\n= g(z) + h(z)\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\u01eb\nwhere z = (u, v, w)T , f (z) = (v, \u03c62 w, v)T , g(z) = (g(u), 0, 0)T and h(z) =\n(0, \u2212v + (\u03b5\u03c62 \u2212 D)wx , p(u) \u2212 w)T . When \u03b5 is small, the presence of both\nnon-stiff and stiff terms, suggests the use of IMEX schemes [7\u20139]. In the\n\n\fApril 1, 2019\n\n12:52\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nCavalliSemplice\n\n4\n\nproblems considered here, the reaction term g(u) is not stiff and hence we\ntreat it with the explicit portion of the IMEX scheme.\nFirst we consider a semi-discrete form for time integration. Let's assume\nfor simplicity a uniform time step \u2206t and denote with z n the numerical\napproximation of the variable z at time tn = n\u2206t, for n = 0, 1, . . . In our\ncase a \u03bd-stages IMEX scheme reads\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\nX\n\u2206t X\n\u2202f (i)\nbi h(z (i) )\n(4)\n(z ) + g(z (i) ) +\nb\u0303i\nz n+1 = z n \u2212 \u2206t\n\u2202x\n\u03b5\ni=1\ni=1\nwhere the stage values are computed as\nz (i) = B (i) +\n\n\u2206t\nai,i h(z (i) )\n\u03b5\n\n(5)\n\nfor\nB (i) = z n \u2212 \u2206t\n\ni\u22121\nX\n\n\u00e3i,k\n\nk=1\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\ni\u22121\n\u2202f (k)\n\u2206t X\n(z ) + g(z (k) ) +\nai,k h(z (k) )\n\u2202x\n\u03b5\n\n(6)\n\nk=1\n\nHere (aik , bi ) and (\u00e3ik , b\u0303i ) are a pair of Butcher's tableaux [10] of, respectively, a diagonally implicit and an explicit Runge-Kutta schemes.\nIn this work we use the so-called relaxed schemes, that are obtained by\nformally letting \u03b5 \u2192 0 in (4). For these the computation of the first stage,\nthat is (5) with i = 1,\n\uf8eb\uf8ee (1) \uf8f9\uf8f6\n\uf8ee (1) \uf8f9 \uf8ee n \uf8f9\nu\nu\nu\n\uf8f0 v (1) \uf8fb = \uf8f0 v n \uf8fb + \u2206t a1,1 h \uf8ed\uf8f0 v (1) \uf8fb\uf8f8\n(7)\n\u03b5\n(1)\n(1)\nn\nw\nw\nw\nimplies that h(z (2) ) = 0, which is equivalent to\nu(1) = un\n\nw(1) = p(u(1) )\n\nv (1) =\n\n\u2202w(1)\n,\n\u2202x\n\nNow the second stage, i = 2, reads\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202f (1)\n\u2206t\n\u2206t\nz (2) = z n \u2212 \u2206t\u00e32,1\n(z ) + g(z (1) ) +\na2,1 h(z (1) ) + a2,2 h(z (2) ).\n| {z } \u03b5\n\u2202x\n\u03b5\n\u22610\n\nHence the last two components of z (2) are determined by the stiff terms of\nthe above expression, namely h(z (1) ) = 0. On the other hand, due the form\nof h(z), there are no stiff terms in the equation for the first component u(2) ,\nwhich is then determined by a balance law.\n\n\fApril 1, 2019\n\n12:52\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nCavalliSemplice\n\n5\n\nSummarizing, the relaxed scheme yields an alternation of relaxation\nsteps\nh(z (i) ) = 0\n\ni.e. w(i) = p(u(i) ), v (i) =\n\n\u2202w(i)\n\u2202x\n\nand transport steps where we advance for time \u00e3i,k \u2206t\n\u2202z \u2202f (z)\n+\n= g(z)\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\n(8)\n\nwith initial data z = z (i) , retain only the first component and assign it to\nP\nu(i+1) . Finally the value of un+1 is computed as un + b\u0303i u(i) .\n3.2. Spatial reconstructions\nIn order to have a fully discrete scheme, we still need to specify the space\ndiscretization. We will use discretizations based on finite differences, in\norder to avoid cell coupling due to the source terms.\nRecall that the IMEX technique reduces the integration to a cascade of\nrelaxation and transport steps. The former are the implicit parts of (7) and\n(5), while the transport steps appear in the evaluation of the explicit terms\nB (i) in (6). Since (7) and (5) involve only local operations, the main task\nof the space discretization is the evaluation of \u2202x f , where we will exploit\nthe linearity of f in its arguments.\nIn the one-dimensional case, let us consider a uniform grid on [a, b] \u2282 R,\nxj = a \u2212 h2 + jh for j = 1, . . . , m, where h = (b \u2212 a)/m is the grid spacing\nand m the number of cells.

It is necessary to write the scheme in conservation form\nand thus, following [11], we introduce the function F\u0302 such that\nZ\n1 x+h/2\nF\u0302 (s, t)ds\nf (z(x, t)) =\nh x\u2212h/2\nand hence\n\u0011\n\u2202f\n1\u0010\nF\u0302 (xj+1/2 , t) \u2212 F\u0302 (xj\u22121/2 , t) .\n(z(xj , t)) =\n\u2202x\nh\n\n\fApril 1, 2019\n\n12:52\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nCavalliSemplice\n\n6\n\nThe numerical flux function Fj+1/2 approximates F\u0302 (xj+1/2 ).\nIn order to compute the numerical fluxes, for each stage value, we re(i)\u00b1\nconstruct boundary extrapolated data zj+1/2 with a non-oscillatory inter(i)\n\npolation method, starting from the point values zj of the variables at\nthe centre of the cells. Next we apply a monotone numerical flux to these\nboundary extrapolated data.\nTo minimize numerical viscosity we choose the Godunov flux, which,\nin the present case of a linear system of equations, reduces to the upwind\nflux. In order to select the upwind direction we write the linear system with\nconstant coefficients (8) in characteristic form. The characteristic variables\nrelative to the eigenvalues \u03c6, \u2212\u03c6, 0 are respectively\n\u03c6w \u2212 v\nv + \u03c6w\nV =\nW = u \u2212 w.\nU=\n2\u03c6\n2\u03c6\nNote that u = U + V + W . Therefore the numerical flux in characteristic\n\u2212\n+\nvariables is Fj+1/2 = (\u03c6Uj+1/2\n, \u2212\u03c6Vj+1/2\n, 0).\nThe accuracy of the scheme depends on the accuracy of the reconstruction of the boundary extrapolated data. For a first order scheme\n\u2212\nwe use a piecewise constant reconstruction such that Uj+1/2\n= Uj and\n+\nVj+1/2 = Vj+1 . For higher order schemes, we use ENO or WENO reconstructions of appropriate accuracy [11].\nSince the transport steps need to be applied only to u(i) , we have\n(i)\n\nuj = unj \u2212\u03bb\n\ni\u22121\nX\n\nk=1\n\ni\n\u0011\nh \u0010\n(k)\n(k)+\n(k)+\n(k)\u2212\n(k)\u2212\n\u00e3i,k \u03c6 Uj+1/2 \u2212 Uj\u22121/2 \u2212 Vj+1/2 + Vj\u22121/2 + \u2206tg(uj )\n\nFinally, taking the last stage value and going back to conservative variables,\n\u0010\nP\u03bd\n(i)+\n(i)\u2212\n(i)+\n(i)\u2212\nun+1\n= unj \u2212 \u03bb2 i=1 b\u0303i [vj+1/2 + vj+1/2 \u2212 (vj\u22121/2 + vj\u22121/2 )]\nj\n\u0011\n(i)+\n(i)\u2212\n(i)+\n(i)\u2212\n+\u03c6[wj+1/2 \u2212 wj+1/2 \u2212 (wj\u22121/2 \u2212 wj\u22121/2 )]\nWe wish to emphasize that the scheme reduces to the time advancement\nof the single variable u. Although the scheme is based on a system of three\nequations, the construction is used only to select the correct upwinding for\nthe fluxes of the relaxed scheme and the computational cost of each time\nstep is not affected.\n3.3. Numerical scheme\nEmploying a Runge-Kutta IMEX scheme of order p, can give an integration\nprocedure for (1) which is of order up to 2p with respect to h (see [6]),\n\n\fApril 1, 2019\n\n12:52\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nCavalliSemplice\n\n7\n\nbecause the CFL restrictions on the time-step are of parabolic type (\u2206t \u2264\nCh2 ). We observed that this theoretical convergence rate can be achieved in\npractice, with careful choice of the approximations of the spatial derivatives.\nSummarizing, the relaxed schemes that we propose for the numerical\nintegration of (1) consists of the following steps.\nFor each Runge-Kutta stage we need to compute the variables v (i) and\nw(i) (relaxation steps). The computation of v (i) requires the approximation\nof a spatial gradient operator, for which we choose a central finite difference\noperator of order at least 2p. Then we need to solve the transport equation\nby diagonalizing the linear system (8), reconstructing the characteristic\nvariables U (i) and V (i) at cell boundaries and computing the fluxes. Again,\nwe must choose a spatial reconstructions of order at least 2p and, to avoid\nspurious oscillations, we employ ENO or WENO non-oscillatory procedures.\nThese procedures compare, for each cell, the reconstructions obtained using\ndifferent stencils and choose the least oscillatory one (ENO) or compute a\nweighted linear combination of all of them (WENO). For details, see [11].\n4. Numerical results\n4.1. Travelling waves tests\nAs a first test, we consider the one-dimensional Fisher-Kolmogoroff equation, namely\n\u22022u\n\u2202u\n= ku(1 \u2212 u) + D 2\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\n(9)\n\nfor x \u2208 R and t > 0, which was initially proposed for the modelling of\nspatial spread of populations [2].\nThe two uniform steady states of (9) are u0 (x) = 0 and u1 (x) = 1. A\ncareful analysis of the state space, reveals the existence of travelling wave\nsolutions linking these two states, i.e. of solutions of the form u(x, t) =\nU (x \u2212 ct) such that U (\u2212\u221e) = 1 and U (\u221e) = 0.

Conclusions\nWe have proposed and analyzed relaxed schemes for nonlinear degenerate\nreaction diffusion equations. By using suitable discretization in space and\ntime, namely ENO/WENO non-oscillatory reconstructions for numerical\nfluxes and IMEX Runge-Kutta schemes for time integration, we have obtained a class of high order schemes. The theoretical convergence analysis\nfor the semidiscrete scheme and the stability for the fully discrete schemes\nhave been studied by us, for the case of nonlinear diffusion, in [6].\nHere we tested these schemes on travelling waves solutions and in cases\nwhere the solution vanishes in finite time. In all cases we observed a very\ngood agreement with known properties of the exact solutions.\nReferences\n1. D. G. Aronson, SIAM J. Appl. Math. 19, 299 (1970).\n2. J. D.
