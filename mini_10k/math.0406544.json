In the book the varieties of representations had been\nconsidered. In the matter of fact, the varieties under consideration\nare action-type varieties. This paper studies other classes of representations, axiomatizable in the special action-type logic.\n\n1\n\nBackground (preliminaries)\n\n1.1\n\nVariety Rep \u2212 K\n\nGiven a commutative with the unit ring K, consider a variety which is\nalso a category, denoted by Rep \u2212 K. The algebras of this variety are twosorted algebras. These algebras are pairs, or representations, (V, G), where\nV is K-module and G a group, acting in V . The action is treated as an\noperation in the two-sorted algebra (V, G).\nThe axioms are as follows:\n\u2022 1. the mapping a \u2192 a \u25e6 g is a K-linear mapping in V ,\n\u2022 2. (a \u25e6 g1 ) \u25e6 g2 = a \u25e6 g1 g2 ,\n\u2022 3. a \u25e6 1 = a.\n\n1\n\n\fHere 1 is the unit in G, a \u2208 V, g \u2208 G. The operation \u25e6 recovers the\nrepresentation \u03c1 : G \u2192 AutV , which is sometimes identified with the algebra\n(V, G), i.e., \u03c1 = (V, G).\nThe pointed identities together with the identities of groups and Kmodules determine the variety Rep \u2212 K. As usual, this variety is also a\ncategory. Its morphisms are two-sorted homomorphisms\n\u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2) : (V, G) \u2192 (V \u2032 , G\u2032 ),\nwhere \u03b1 : V \u2192 V \u2032 a K-homomorphism of modules, \u03b2 : G \u2192 G\u2032 is a homomorphism of groups, and (a\u25e6g)\u03b1 = a\u03b1 \u25e6g \u03b2 . We have: Ker\u03bc = (Ker\u03b1, Ker\u03b2).\nTake Ker\u03b1 = V0 , Ker\u03b2 = H. Then the pair (V0 , H) is a congruence of the\nrepresentation (V, G) in the following sense: V0 is a submodule in V , invariant under the action of the group G, H is a normal subgroup in G, acting\ntrivially in V /V0 . We have (V, G)/Ker\u03bc = (V /V0 , G/H). This gives the\ntheorem on homomorphisms.\nLet us consider a free representation W = W (X, Y ) Here the pair (X, Y )\nis a two-sorted set. We have: W (X, Y ) = (XKF (Y ), F (Y )), where F (Y ) =\nF is a free group over the set Y , XKF = \u03a6 is a free KF -module over the\nset X and KF is a group algebra.\nThe elements of \u03a6 have the form w = x1 u1 + ... + xn un , ui \u2208 KF ; the\nelements of F are written as f = f (y1 , ..., ym ). The action \u25e6 is defined by the\nrule:\nw \u25e6 f = wf = x1 (u1 f ) + ... + xn (un f ).\nIt is easy to understand that the mappings \u03b1 : X \u2192 V and \u03b2 : Y \u2192 G\ndetermine the homomorphism \u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2) : (\u03a6, F ) = W \u2192 (V, G).\nConsider further the sets Hom(W, \u03c1) = Hom(W, (V, G)). In the situation\nof the finite X = {x1 , ..., xn } and Y = {y1 , ..., ym} the sets Hom(W, \u03c1) are\ntreated as affine spaces. There is a natural bijection Hom(W, \u03c1) \u2192 V (n) \u00d7\nG(m) . A point\n((\u03b1(x1 ), ..., (\u03b1(xn )), (\u03b2(y1 ), ..., \u03b2(ym))) = ((a1 , ..., an ), (g1 , ..., gm )),\nai \u2208 V, gk \u2208 G, corresponds to the homomorphism \u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2) : (\u03a6, F ) \u2192\n(V, G).\n\n2\n\n\f1.2\n\nLogic in Rep \u2212 K.\n\nGiven X and Y , consider a signature\nL = LX,Y = {\u2228, \u2227, \u00ac, \u2203x, \u2203y, x \u2208 X, y \u2208 Y }.\nFor the algebra W = W (X, Y ) we consider equalities w \u2261 0 and f \u2261 1. We\ntreat these equalities as logical formulas. The equalities of the first kind we\ncall action-type equalities, while the equalities of the second type we call group\nequalities. Denote by LW = LX,Y W (X, Y ) the absolutely free L-algebra over\nthe set of all W -equalities. Its elements we call formulas (elementary, first\norder formulas) over the free representation W = (\u03a6, F ).\nLet us consider an example of L-algebra. Take the set Hom(W, (V, G)).\nLet Set(W, (V, G)) be a system of all subsets of Hom(W, (V, G)). It is clear,\nthat boolean operations are defined in Set(W, (V, G)) and it is a boolean\nalgebra. Let us define also quantifiers. Let A be a subset of Hom(W, (V, G)).\nWe set: \u03bc(\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2208 \u2203xA, if there exists \u03bd = (\u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2) such that \u03bd \u2208 A and\n\u03b1(x1 ) = \u03b1\u2032 (x1 ) for x1 6= x. Analogously we define \u2203yA. Here \u2203x and \u2203y are\nquantifiers of the boolean algebra Set(W, (V, G)) in the sense of the following\ndefinition.\nThe quantifier \u2203 of a boolean algebra B is a mapping \u2203 : B \u2192 B with\nthe properties:\n\u2022 1. \u22030 = 0,\n\u2022 2. a < \u2203a,\n\u2022 3. \u2203(a \u2227 \u2203b) = \u2203a \u2227 \u2203b.\nHere 0 is a zero in B, and a, b \u2208 B. Define now a canonical homomorphism\nof L-algebras\nW\nV al = V al(V,G)\n: LW \u2192 Set(W, (V, G)).\nWe set: \u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2208 V al(w \u2261 0), if w \u03b1 = 0 in V , \u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2208 V al(f \u2261 1),\nif f \u03b2 = 1 in G. Since LW is free, this determines V al(u) for every formula\nu \u2208 LW . Here the set of homomorphisms V al(u) is called the value of the\nformula u in the representation (V, G). If V al(u) = Hom(W, (V, G)), then it\nmeans that the formula u holds in the representation (V, G).\nDefine further separately the logic of action (action-type logic). It is generated by equalities of action w \u2261 0 in the signature LX = {\u2228, \u2227, \u00ac, \u2203x, x \u2208\nX}. There are no quantifiers \u2203y and equalities f \u2261 1. Denote this logic by\nLX W .\n3\n\n\f1.3\n\nClasses of representations\n\nConsider classes X of representations (V, G) in Rep \u2212 K and, simultaneously, the sets of formulas T in the logic LW with countable X and Y . We\nestablish Galois correspondence\nT = X\u2217 = {u \u2208 LW | u holds in every (V, G) \u2208 X}\nX = T \u2217 = {(V, G)| every formula from T holds in (V, G)}.\nA class X of the kind X = T \u2217 is called axiomatizable one. Here T is an\narbitrary set. If T consists of action-type formulas, then X = T \u2217 is an\naction-type axiomatizable class.\nLet us distinguish special cases.\n1. T consists of equalities. Then X = T \u2217 is a variety of representations.\nIf T consists of action-type equalities, then X = T \u2217 is an action-type variety.\nSuch X is given also by the formulas of the form x \u25e6 u \u2261 0, u \u2208 KF .\n2. Formulas of the kind u1 \u2228 u2 \u2228 . . . \u2228 un , where all ui are equalities, are\ncalled pseudo-equalities (or pseudo-identities). The corresponding X = T \u2217\nare called pseudo-varieties. Action-type pseudo-varieties are given by the\nformulas of the w1 \u2261 0 \u2228 . . . \u2228 wn \u2261 0 kind.\n3. Formulas of the kind u1 \u2227u2 \u2227. . .\u2227un =\u21d2 u, where all ui are equalities,\nare called quasi-equalities (or quasi-identities). Formulas w1 \u2261 0 \u2227 . . . \u2227 wn \u2261\n0 =\u21d2 w \u2261 0 is an action-type quasi-identity. We have quasi-varieties and\naction-type quasi-varieties.\n4. Universal formulas have the form u1 \u2228 . . . \u2228 un \u2228 \u00acv1 \u2228 . . . \u2228 \u00acvm\nwhere ui and vj are equalities. Universal action-type formulas have the form\n\u2032\nw1 \u2261 0 \u2228 . . . \u2228 wn \u2261 0 \u2228 w1\u2032 6\u2261 0 \u2228 . . . \u2228 wm\n6\u2261 0. The corresponding classes\nX are universal classes and action-type universal classes. We consider also\nclasses X, axiomatizable by arbitrary action-type formulas.\nA class X we call a saturated one if the inclusion (V, G) \u2208 X holds if and\nonly if for the corresponding faithful representation (V, G) holds (V, G) \u2208 X.\nA class X we call a right-hereditary one, if (V, G) \u2208 X =\u21d2 (V, H) \u2208 X\nholds for every subgroup H in G.\nFinally, class of representations X is called a right-local one, if (V, G) \u2208 X\nholds if all (V, H) belong to X, where H are finitary-generated subgroups in\nG.\n\n4\n\n\f2\n2.1\n\nAction-type axiomatizable classes\nTheorem\n\nTheorem 1. If class X is given by action-type formulas, then such class is\nsaturated, right-hereditary and right-local.\nProof. Check first that the class is saturated.\nTake a representation (V, G) and the corresponding faithful representation\n(V, G). Let \u03b20 : G \u2192 G be the natural homomorphism. Then for any a \u2208 V\nand g \u2208 G we have a \u25e6 g = a \u25e6 g \u03b20 . Consider, further, homomorphisms\n\u03bc0 = (\u03b1, \u03b2) : W \u2192 (V, G)\nand\n\u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2\u03b20) : W \u2192 (V, G).\nWe have the diagram\nW\n\n\u03bc0 \u2732\n\n(V, G)\n\n\u25d7\n\u25d7\n\u03bc\n\u25d7\ns\n\u25d7\n\n\u03bd=(1,\u03b20 )\n\n\u2744\n\n(V, G)\nHere \u03bc = \u03bc0 \u03bd and every \u03bc can be represented in such a way.\nNote that the homomorphism \u03b2 : F \u2192 G induces the homomorphism\n\u03b2 : KF \u2192 KG of group algebras. We have also \u03b20 : KG \u2192 KG, and\na \u25e6 h = a \u25e6 h\u03b20 for every a \u2208 V and h \u2208 KG.\nTake now an element w = x1 \u25e6 u1 + . . . + xn \u25e6 un . Then\n0\n0\nw \u03b1 = x\u03b11 \u25e6 u\u03b21 + . . . + x\u03b1n \u25e6 u\u03b2n = x\u03b11 \u25e6 u\u03b2\u03b2\n+ . . . + x\u03b1n \u25e6 u\u03b2\u03b2\n1\nn .\n\nFrom this follows that w \u03b1 \u2261 0 holds in (V, G) if and only if the same holds\nin (V, G). In other words,\n\u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2\u03b20 ) \u2208 V al(V,G) (w \u2261 0) \u21d4 \u03bc0 = (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2208 V al(V,G) (w \u2261 0)\nholds for every formula of the type w \u2261 0. Prove by induction, that this is\ntrue for every action-type formula. Let it be true for action-type formulas\nu and v. Pass to u \u2228 v, u \u2227 v, \u00acu, \u2203x u. Let \u03bc \u2208 V al(V,G) (u \u2228 v) =\nV al(V,G) (u)\u2228V al(V,G) (v) and let, say, \u03bc \u2208 V al(V,G) (u). Then \u03bc0 \u2208 V al(V,G) (u),\n5\n\n\f\u03bc0 \u2208 V al(V,G) (u \u2228 v). Similarly we check that \u03bc0 \u2208 V al(V,G) (u \u2228 v) =\u21d2 \u03bc \u2208\nV al(V,G) (u \u2228 v). Just the same for the case u \u2227 v.\nLet now \u03bc \u2208 V al(V,G) (\u00acu) = \u00acV al(V,G) (u), i.e., \u03bc 6\u2208 V al(V,G) (u). Hence,\n\u03bc0 6\u2208 V al(V,G) (u), \u03bc0 \u2208 V al(V,G) (\u00acu). The same for the opposite direction.\nConsider now \u2203xu. Let \u03bc \u2208 V al(V,G) (\u2203xu) = \u2203xV al(V,G) (u). Find \u03bd =\n(\u03b11 , \u03b2\u03b20 ) \u2208 V al(V,G) (u), \u03b11 (x1 ) = \u03b1(x1 ), x1 6= x. Let us note here, that\nthe induction proceeds by any pairs \u03bc and \u03bc0 fitting the diagram. Take\n\u03bd0 = (\u03b11 , \u03b2), \u03bd = \u03bd0 (1, \u03b20 ). Inclusion \u03bd \u2208 V al(V,G) (u) is equivalent to the\ninclusion \u03bd0 \u2208 V al(V,G) (u). Since \u03b11 (x1 ) = \u03b1(x1 ) for x1 6= x, we conclude\nthat \u03bc0 \u2208 V al(V,G) (\u2203xu). Similarly, \u03bc0 \u2208 V al(V,G) implies \u03bc \u2208 V al(V,G) .\nAssume now that the class X is given by some set of action-type formulas.\nEach of these formulas holds in the representation (V, G) if and only if it holds\nin the representation (V, G). Hence, the class X is saturated.\nCheck further that the class is right-hereditary. Take (V, G) and (V, H),\nH \u2282 G. For every action-type formula u verify that\nV al(V,H) (u) = V al(V,G) (u) \u2229 Hom(W, (V, H)).\nAgain we apply induction. The case when u is an equality w \u2261 0 is easily\nchecked. It is also easily verified that if u and v meet the condition, then\nthe same is true for u \u2228 v, u \u2227 v and \u00acu. It is left to check \u2203xu if there is\nan equality for u. Take \u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2208 V al(V,H) (\u2203xu) = \u2203xV al(V,H) (u). Then\n\u03bc \u2208 Hom(W, (V, H)) and there is an element \u03bd = (\u03b11 , \u03b2) with \u03b11 (x1 ) =\n\u03b1(x1 ) if x1 6= x, \u03bd \u2208 V al(V,H) (u). By the condition, \u03bd \u2208 V al(V,G) (u) and\n\u03bc \u2208 \u2203xV al(V,G) = V al(V,G) \u2203xu, \u03bc \u2208 V al(V,G) \u2203xu \u2229 Hom(W, (V, H)). Conversely, let \u03bc \u2208 V al(V,G) (\u2203xu) \u2229 Hom(W, (V, H)), \u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2) and \u03b2 is a\nhomomorphism F \u2192 H. Find \u03bd = (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2208 V al(V,G) (u) \u2229 Hom(W, (V, H)) =\nV al(V,H) (u), \u03b11 (x1 ) = \u03b1(x1 ), x1 6= x. Now \u03bc \u2208 V al(V,H) (\u2203xu). The equality\nis checked. Assume now, that the action-type formula u holds in the representation (V, G), V al(V,G) (u) = Hom(W, (V, G)). We have V al(V,H) (u) =\nHom(W, (V, G))\u2229Hom(W, (V, H)) = Hom(W, (V, H)), and u holds in (V, H).\nThus, the class X is right-hereditary.\nNow it is only left to prove that the class X is right-local. As earlier,\nassume that X is given by action-type formulas. We need to show, that if\nu is action-type formula, (V, G) is a representation, u holds on every (V, H)\nwhere H is finite-generated subgroup in G, then u holds in (V, G) as well.\nWe need some auxiliary material. Let a homomorphism \u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2) :\nW \u2192 (V, G), W = W (X, Y ) = (XKF, F ) be given. Take a subset Y0 in Y\n6\n\n\fand change \u03b2 by \u03b2 \u2032 : F \u2192 G, coinciding with \u03b2 on Y0 and sending all the\nrest y's to the unit. Take further \u03bc\u2032 = (\u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2 \u2032), where \u03b1\u2032 coincides with \u03b1 on\nX. Take now an arbitrary w = x1 \u25e6 u1 + . . . xn \u25e6 un such that supports of\nall ui belong to Y0 (in other words all elements ui are expressed via variables\nfrom Y0 ). Then\n\u2032\n\nw \u03b1 = x\u03b11 \u25e6 u\u03b21 + . . . x\u03b1n \u25e6 u\u03b2n = x\u03b11 \u25e6 u\u03b21 + . . . x\u03b1n \u25e6 u\u03b2n = w \u03b1.\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nFor an arbitrary action-type formula u consider its Y -support \u2206Y (u). We\nhave:\n\u2206Y (u) = \u2206Y (\u00acu) = \u2206Y (\u2203xu),\n\u2206Y (u \u2228 v) = \u2206Y (u \u2227 v) = \u2206Y (u) \u222a \u2206Y (v).\nLet now \u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2) be a homomorphism and u an action-type formula,\nY0 \u2283 \u2206Y (u), Y0 be a finite set. Pass to \u03bc\u2032 = (\u03b1\u2032, \u03b2 \u2032 ) by Y0 . The following\nproperty always takes place in these conditions:\n\u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2208 V al(V,G) (u) \u21d4 \u03bc\u2032 = (\u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2 \u2032) \u2208 V al(V,G) (u).\nLet us check it. The property is evident for identities. Now let it be true\nfor some action-type formula u. Pass to \u00acu and \u2203xu. We have \u2206Y (\u00acu) =\n\u2206Y (\u2203xu) = \u2206Y (u). Take an arbitrary finite Y0 , including these supports.\nLet\n\u03bc \u2208 V al(V,G) (\u00acu), i.e., \u03bc 6\u2208 V al(V,G) (u).\nThen \u03bc\u2032 6\u2208 V al(V,G) (\u00acu) and \u03bc\u2032 \u2208 V al(V,G) (\u00acu). The opposite is checked\nsimilarly.\nPass to \u2203xu with the same Y0 . Given \u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2208 V al(V,G) (\u2203xu) =\n\u2203xV al(V,G) (u), we have \u03bc\u2032 = (\u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2 \u2032 ) by Y0 . Besides that, we can select\n\u03bc1 = (\u03b11 , \u03b2) such that \u03bc1 =\u2208 V al(V,G) (u), \u03b11 (x1 ) = \u03b1(x1 ) for x1 6= x. Take\nonce more \u03bc\u20321 = (\u03b11\u2032 , \u03b2 \u2032) for \u03bc1 = (\u03b11 , \u03b2) by Y0 . Now \u03bc1 \u2208 V al(V,G) (u)\nimplies \u03bc\u20321 \u2208 V al(V,G) (u). Recall that \u03b1 and \u03b1\u2032 coincide on the set X, as\nwell as \u03b11 and \u03b11\u2032 . Then for x1 6= x we have \u03b11\u2032 (x1 ) = \u03b11 (x1 ) = \u03b1(x1 )\u03b1\u2032 (x1 ).\nComparing \u03bc\u2032 with \u03bc\u20321 we conclude: \u03bc\u2032 \u2208 V al(V,G) (\u2203xu). Similarly we derive\n\u03bc\u2032 \u2208 V al(V,G) (\u2203xu) \u21d2 \u03bc \u2208 V al(V,G) (\u2203xu).\n\n7\n\n\fLet now the property holds for u and v. Check u \u2228 v, u \u2227 v. Take\nY0 \u2283 \u2206Y (u \u2228 v) = \u2206Y (u \u2227 v) = \u2206Y (u) \u222a \u2206Y (v). Take \u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2) and pass to\n\u03bc\u2032 = (\u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2 \u2032) by Y0 .\nGiven \u03bc \u2208 V al(V,G) (u\u2228v) = V al(V,G) (u)\u222aV al(V,G) (v). Let \u03bc \u2208 V al(V,G) (u).\nSince Y0 \u2283 \u2206Y (u), then \u03bc\u2032 \u2208 V al(V,G) (u) and \u03bc\u2032 \u2208 V al(V,G) (u \u2228 v).The rest is\ndone in the same way. The property is checked for every u.\nWe continue the proof of the theorem. Let the formula u be hold in every\n(V, H). We have: V al(V,H) (u) = V al(V,G) (u) \u2229 Hom(W, (V, H)). Take an\narbitrary \u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2) and pass to \u03bc\u2032 = (\u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2 \u2032 ) by u. Take Im \u03b2 \u2032 as H. Then\n\u03bc\u2032 \u2208 Hom(W, (V, H)) = V al(V,H) (u). But then \u03bc\u2032 \u2208 V al(V,G) (u) and this gives\n\u03bc \u2208 V al(V,G) (u). This is true for every \u03bc and V al(V,G) (u) = Hom(W, (V, G)).\nThe formula u holds in the representation (V, G).\nLet now the class X is given by the set T of action-type formulas and\nfor the representation (V, G) every representation (V, H) belongs to T \u2217, i.e.,\nsatisfies all u \u2208 T . Then all these u are fulfilled in (V, G) and (V, G) belongs\nto X. Hence, the goal local property takes place and the theorem is proved.\nThere arises the following main\nProblem 1. Is it true that an axiomatized class X is action-type axiomatized\nif and only if it is saturated, right-hereditary and right-local?\nTheorem 2.1 solves the question in one direction, but the opposite claim\nrequires additional considerations.\n\n2.2\n\nTheorem\n\nTheorem 2. For varieties, pseudovarieties, quasivarieties and universal classes\nof reperesentations Problem 1 has a positive solution.\nProof.\nThe case of varieties is studied in [PV]. Apply the general approach, also\noutlined in [PV].\nLet X be a saturated class and G a group. There are representations with\nthe acting group G in X. Denote by XG a G-layer in X, all (V, G) in X are\nwith the given group G.\nLet now X be a pseudovariety satisfying the closure conditions from Problem 1. We need to show that X is given by action-type pseudoidentities. Show\nfirst that the class X with these closure conditions is a pseudovariety if and\nonly if every layer XG is a pseudovariety of G-modules.\n8\n\n\fRecall that the class of algebras \u0398 is a pseudovariety if and only if it\nis closed in respect to ultra-products, subalgebras and homomorphic images\n(for one-sorted algebras see [Ma], the generalization for multi-sorted ones see\nin [Gva]).\nLet now X be a pseudovariety of representations and let this class be\nis saturated, right-hereditary and right-local . Pass to the layer XG . It is\nevident that it is closed under subalgebras and homomorphisms and we need\nto check that it is closed under ultra-products.\nLet I be a set and D a filter of subsets in I. We have\nQ a representation\n(V\u03b1 , G) for every \u03b1 \u2208 I. Take a cartesian product (( \u03b1 V\u03b1 ), GI ) and let\n(V0 , H) be a congruence\nby the filter D. The corresponding\nQ determined\nI\nfiltered product is (( \u03b1 V\u03b1 )/V0 , G /H). It belongs to the\nQ class X if D is an\nultrafilter. Since X is saturated, the representation (( \u03b1 V\u03b1 )/V0 , GI ) also\nI\nbelongs\nQ to X. Embed now G \u2192 G as a diagonal. Since X is hereditary,\nthe (( \u03b1 V\u03b1 )/V0 , G) belongs to X and, consequently, to XG . It is easy to\nunderstand, that this representation is isomorphic to ultra-product by the\nfilter D of all (V\u03b1 , G) with the fixed G. Hence, all XG are pseudovarieties.\nLet now the class X be saturated, right-hereditary and all XG be pseudovarieties. Show that X are pseudovarieties. Check first, that the class X\nis hereditary and closed under homomorphisms. Take (V, G) \u2208 X and let\n(V0 , H) be a subrepresentation. From right-hereditaryty follows that (V, H)\nbelongs to X. Consider further a layer XH . It is a pseudovariety and, consequently, (V0 , H) \u2208 XH and (V0 , H) \u2208 X.\nLet now a surjective homomorphism \u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2) : (V, G) \u2192 (V1 , G1 ),\n(V, G) \u2208 X be given. The homomorphism \u03b2 : G \u2192 G1 determines the\nrepresentation (V1 , G). We have a homomorphism (\u03b1, 1) : (V, G) \u2192 (V1 , G).\nSince the layer XG is closed under homomorphisms, then (V1 , G) \u2208 XG and\n(V1 , G) \u2208 X. The class X is saturated. This means that (V1 , G1 ) \u2208 X.\nIt is left to check that the class X is ultra-closed. Let\nQ I be a set, D\nultrafilter on I. Given (V\u03b1 , G\u03b1 ) \u2208 X, \u03b1 \u2208 I, take G = \u03b1 G\u03b1 . We have\n\u03c0\u03b1 : G \u2192 G\u03b1 determining the representation (V\u03b1 , G). It belongs to X since X\nis saturated.\nQ Consider the layer XG and take in it an ultra-product by D. We\nhave: (( V\u03b1 )/D, G) \u2208 XG and hence it belongs to X. Ultra-product\nby D\nQ\nof all (V\u03b1 , G\u03b1 ) is a homomorphic image of the representation (( V\u03b1 )/D, G).\nSince we have checked closure in respect to homomorphisms, then the corresponding ultra-product contains in X. Hence, X is a pseudovariety with the\ngiven closure conditions.\nLet further X be a pseudovariety. Prove that X is determined by action9\n\n\ftype pseudo-identities. Take a countable set Y and a free group F = F (Y ).\nConsider a layer XF . It is a pseudovariety and it is determined by pseudoidentities. Take the corresponding set of pseudo-identities and let it be indexed by the set I. We identify I with that set.\nConsider pseudo-identities\nw1k \u2261 0 \u2228 . . . wnk k \u2261 0, k \u2208 I.\nDenote by uk the given k-th pseudo-identity, uk = uk (x1 , . . . , xn ; y1 , . . . , ym ).\nBesides, we have wik = wik (x1 , . . . , xn ; y1 , . . . , ym ). We consider all x1 , . . . , xn\nas variables while y1 , . . . , ym are constants. Show that the same set I with\nthe varying y's determines the class X. Take a representation (V, G) and\nshow that it belongs to the class X if and only if all pseudo-identities of the\ngiven set hold in it.\nLet (V, G) \u2208 X. Consider a homomorphism \u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2) : W = W (X, Y ) =\n(XKF, F ) \u2192 (V, G). Using \u03b2 : F \u2192 G, determine a representation (V, F ).\nSince the class X is saturated and right-hereditary, we conclude that (V, F ) \u2208\nX. Then (V, F ) \u2208 XF , and the set I holds in (V, F ). Hence, for every k \u2208 I\nthere is wik = wik (x1 , . . . , xn ; y1 , . . . , ym) with wik (x\u03b11 , . . . , x\u03b1n ; y1 , . . . , ym ) = 0.\n\u03b2\n). Thus, uk holds\nBut wik (x\u03b11 , . . . , x\u03b1n ; y1, . . . , ym ) = wik (x\u03b11 , . . . , n\u03b1 ; y1\u03b2 , . . . , ym\nin (V, G) under the homomorphism \u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2). It is true for every k and \u03bc.\nThis means that the set of formulas I holds in the representation (V, G).\nConversely, let the set I holds in (V, G). We need to check that (V, G) \u2208\nX. Take a finitely generated subgroup H in G and a surjection \u03b2 : F \u2192 H.\nTake (V, F ) defined by this surjection. For an arbitrary \u03b1 : X \u2192 V we have a\nKF -homomorphism \u03b1 : XKF \u2192 V . We have also \u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2) : W \u2192 (V, G).\n\u03b2\nFor every k find wik (x1 , . . . , xn ; y1, . . . , ym ) with wik (x\u03b11 , . . . , n\u03b1 ; y1\u03b2 , . . . , ym\n)=\n0 = wik (x\u03b11 , . . . , n\u03b1 ; y1 , . . . , ym ). This means that the set I with the fixed y's is\nhold in (V, F ), i.e., (V, F ) \u2208 XF . But then (V, F ) \u2208 X and (V, H) \u2208 X. This\nholds for every finitely generated subgroup H in G and, therefore, (V, G) \u2208 X.\nThe case of pseudovariety is completed. The reasoning of the same type\nis used for quasi-varieties and universal classes.\nConsider quasivarieties in more detail, taking into account their special\nrole in algebraic geometry [PTs].\nIt is known (see [Ma], [GL]) that if X is a class of algebras and qV ar(X)\nis a quasivariety generated by the class X, then\nqV ar(X) = SCCup (X).\n10\n\n\fHere S is an operator of taking of subalgebras, C cartesian products and\nCup an operator of taking ultra-products. This implies also that it is enough\nto check that the corresponding class is closed in respect to the operator S\nand arbitrary filtered products. Besides, we need to assume that there are\none-element subalgebras in the class.\nUsing all this, prove the theorem for quasivarieties. Let us prove that if\nX is a saturated, right-hereditary and right-local quasivariety, then this X is\nan action-type quasivariety.\nAs earlier, select the following two items of the proof. Check first of all\nthat if X satisfies the pointed closure conditions, then X is a quasivariety if\nand only if every layer XG is a quasivariety. Then using the layer XF and closure conditions, prove that the class X is determined by action-type quasivarieties. The first item of the proof copies the one for pseudo-varieties with the\nonly difference that we work with filtered products instead of cartesian and\nultra-products. The second item follows the idea used for pseudo-varieties.\nThe same reasoning with two items we use for universal classes. Now the\ntheorem 2.2 is proved.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nGeneral theorem\nSome general considerations\n\nIn the previous theorem we used the fact that if the class X is given by\naxioms of a special kind, then every layer XG is determined by the axioms\nof the same kind as well. However we cannot say anything similar if the\ntype of the axioms is not fixed. We cannot claim, that if the class X is\naxiomatized and meets the demanded closure conditions, then the layer XF\nis also axiomatized. We will study this obstacle later on.\nLet us note that it is convenient to use the following terminology. We call\na class X strictly saturated if it is saturated, right-hereditary and right-local.\n\n3.2\n\nThe theorem\n\nTheorem 3. Let X be an axiomatized class of representations and a layer\nXF also axiomatized. Such X is action-type axiomatized if and only if it is\nstrictly saturated.\n\n11\n\n\fProof. Let us make some additional remarks on the layer XF . First of all,\nwe denote by Rep \u2212 KF the class of all K-representations of the free group\nF . The class Rep \u2212 KF of all (V, F ) is a subvariety in Rep \u2212 K.\nEvery representation (V, F ) we consider now as a one-sorted algebra,\nwhose morphisms have the type \u03b1 = (\u03b1, 1) : (V, F ) \u2192 (V1 , F ), and they commute with the action of the group F . The free representation in Rep \u2212 KF\nis the same (XKF, F ). Logic of the representation Rep \u2212 KF consists of\naction-type formulas but we consider these formulas from another perspective: we view variables of the set Y as constants, they are immutable. If u\nis an action-type formula in the logic over Rep \u2212 K, then the same u in the\nlogic Rep \u2212KF is denoted by u0 . If T is the set of action-type formulas, then\ncorrespondingly we consider T 0 . Let the set T determines a class X. Whether\nwe can claim that T 0 determines the layer XF ? Probably not. We can claim\nthat every u0 \u2208 T 0 holds in every (V, F ) \u2208 XF , but we cannot claim that if\nT 0 holds in some (V, F ), then T holds in (V, F ) \u2208 X as well. There are no\ngeneral arguments for the feature of the layer XF to be axiomatizable.\nLet us pass to the proof of the theorem 3.2. Let the conditions of this\ntheorem hold for X and the layer XF is axiomatized by a set of formulas T 0\nwhere T is a set of action-type formulas. Show that this T determines the\nclass X. We use the same reasoning as before.\nTake a representation (V, G). Let it belong to X. Check that all formulas\nfrom T hold in (V, G).\nConsider a homomorphism\n\u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2) : (XKF, F ) \u2192 (V, G).\nApplying \u03b2 : F \u2192 G, pass to the representation (V, F ). Let Im \u03b2 =\nH. We have (V, H), and this representation belongs to X since it is righthereditary. The class X is saturated, hence the representation (V, F ) belongs\nto X. But then it belongs to the layer XF and all axioms of the set T 0 hold\nin it.\nHere we deviate a bit from the main stream and consider the following\nproperty.\nGiven a homomorphism \u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2) : (XKF, F ) \u2192 (V, G), pass, as earlier,\nto (V, F ). Then \u03b1 \u2208 V al(V,F ) (u0 ) \u21d4 \u03bc \u2208 V al(V,G) (u) for every action-type\nformula u. Prove this by induction. Let first u be w \u2261 0, w = x1 \u25e6 u1 + . . . +\nxn \u25e6 un . Then w \u03b1 = x\u03b11 \u25e6 u1 + . . . + x\u03b1n \u25e6 un = x\u03b11 \u25e6 u\u03b21 + . . . + x\u03b1n \u25e6 u\u03b2n . Thus,\nw \u03b1 = 0 holds in (V, F ) if and only if the same holds in (V, G). The property\nis checked for elementary formulas.\n12\n\n\fLet the property be checked for some u. Verify it for \u00acu and \u2203xu. Take\n\u03b1 \u2208 V al(V,F ) (\u00acu0 ), i.e., \u03b1 6\u2208 V al(V,F ) (u0 ), and \u03bc 6\u2208 V al(V,G) (u), i.e., \u03bc \u2208\nV al(V,G) (\u00acu). The same for the opposite direction.\nLet now \u03b1 \u2208 V al(V,F ) (\u2203xu0 ) = \u2203xV al(V,F ) (u0 ). Find \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 V al(V,F ) (u0 )\nwith \u03b1\u2032 (x1 ) = \u03b1(x1 ) for x1 6= x. We have \u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2). Take \u03bc\u2032 = (\u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2) =\n(\u03b1\u2032 , 1)(1, \u03b2). Since \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 V al(V,F ) (u0 ) and (V, F ) is built from (V, G) by \u03b2, then\n\u03bc\u2032 \u2208 V al(V,G) (u). Together with \u03b1\u2032 (x1 ) = \u03b1(x1 ) this gives \u03bc \u2208 V al(V,G) (\u2203xu).\nLet \u03bc \u2208 V al(V,G) (\u2203xu), \u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2). Take \u03bc\u2032 = (\u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2) \u2208 V al(V,G) (u), \u03b1\u2032 (x1 ) =\n\u03b1(x1 ), x1 6= x. We have \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 V al(V,F ) (u0 ) and \u03b1 \u2208 V al(V,F ) (\u2203xu0 ). The cases\nu \u2228 v and u \u2227 v are checked in the same way. The property is checked.\nLet us return to the proof of the theorem. Let now u \u2208 T , u0 \u2208 T 0 .\nThen the formula u0 holds in the representation (V, F ), and for every \u03b1 :\n(XKF, F ) \u2192 (V, F ) we have \u03b1 \u2208 V al(V,F ) (u0 ). Apply this to the initial\n\u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2). Then \u03bc \u2208 V al(V,G) (u). This holds for every \u03bc and V al(V,G) (u) =\nHom(W, (V, G)). The formula u holds in (V, G).\nLet now the set T holds in (V, G). We need to check that (V, G) \u2208 X.\nSince X is right-local, it is enough to verify that (V, H) \u2208 X for every finitely\ngenerated subgroup H \u2282 G.\nConsider such H and a surjection \u03b2F \u2192 H. Take (V, F ) by it. For an\narbitrary \u03b1X \u2192 V and pass to KF -homomorphism \u03b1 : XKF \u2192 V . We\nhave also \u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2) : W \u2192 (V, G).\nAs we have seen, \u03b1 \u2208 V al(V,F ) (u0 ) \u21d4 \u03bc = (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2208 V al(V,G) (u) holds\nfor every formula u0 \u2208 T 0 , u \u2208 T . Since \u03bc \u2208 V al(V,G) (u) for every \u03bc, then\n\u03b1 \u2208 V al(V,F ) (u0 ) for every \u03b1 : XKF \u2192 V . This means that the set T 0 holds\nin (V, F ). Since T 0 determines the layer XF , then (V, F ) \u2208 XF , and, hence,\n(V, F ) \u2208 X. This implies that (V, H) \u2208 X and, therefore, we have (V, G) \u2208 X.\nThe theorem is proved in one direction, and what's more, the initial\nclass X need not be axiomatizable. The opposite direction follows from the\ntheorem 2.1, and here we do not demand the layer XF to be axiomatizable.\nThe main Problem 1 remains open in full generalality.\n\nReferences\n[Gva]\n\nA.
