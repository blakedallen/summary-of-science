In\nthe first of these experiments [1], a part of the resonance\nfluorescence of a single Ba+ ion was back-reflected onto\nthe ion with a distant mirror, and the resulting emission\nwas found to be modulated upon variation of the ionmirror distance. In the second experiment [2], a single\nCa+ ion was placed inside an optical cavity, and light\ncoupled into the cavity was resonantly scattered. When\nthe ion was shifted along the cavity axis, periodic variation of the emission was observed. In the most recent\nexperiment [3], the setup was similar but here the cavity was resonant with an electric-quadrupole transition\nin Ca+ . This transition was coherently driven by light\ncoupled into the cavity, and the excitation probability\nwas found to be strongly modulated with the position of\nthe ion in the cavity mode.\nAll these studies are based on the interaction of a single atom with an optical standing wave. While in the\ntwo Ca+ experiments a standing wave of resonant light\nforms inside the optical cavity, in the Ba+ experiment\npart of the electromagnetic mode structure (or vacuum\nfield) around the ion is transformed into a standing wave\nby the back-reflecting mirror.\nSub-wavelength resolution is achieved because the position of the ion relative to the mirror(s) is well-controlled\nand the ion's spatial wavefunction is confined to a region much smaller than the optical wavelength \u03bb (400 to\n800 nm). This strong confinement is due to the trapping\npotential of a Paul-type ion trap, which to very good\napproximation can be considered harmonic with typical\noscillation frequencies \u03a9t from 1 to several MHz and a\nspatial extension of the lowest energy eigenstate around\n10 nm. Laser cooling can prepare ions in thermal states\nwith low average quantum numbers. Preparation of the\nmotional ground state with high purity has also been\nachieved by means of sideband laser cooling [4, 5, 6]. In\n\nthe cases considered here, the ions were Doppler-cooled,\ni.e. their motional energy Eth was comparable to the\nlinewidth of the cooling transition which in all cases is\nabout\n20 MHz. Since the spatial extension scales with\n\u221a\nn\u0304, where n\u0304 = Eth /h\u0304\u03a9t is the thermal energy in units\nof trap quanta, a resolution between about 10 and 50 nm\nwas achieved.\nWith this resolution, local variations of an optical field\ncan be detected by shifting the single ion through the field\nstructure. Therefore this technique received the name\noptical nanoscope [2]. Similar sub-wavelength mapping\ntechniques are used in microscopy [7], and they have also\nbeen demonstrated with single molecules instead of ions\n[8].\nWhile the typical length scale of an optical field is\nits wavelength, smaller structures can emerge, e.g., in\ndiffraction patterns, as high-order modes of optical resonators, or in general when several partial waves are superimposed and interfere. A standing wave is a comparatively simple structure, formed by superposition of two\ncounterpropagating travelling waves of equal amplitude\nand polarization. It is nevertheless a highly instructive\ncase because the observation of a standing-wave structure\nis connected to the interference between two processes\npertaining to the two travelling waves. The resolution\nwith which the structure is detected determines the visibility of the observed interference fringes. In turn, the\nobserved visibility is a measure for the resolution and\nhence for the spatial extension of the ion as well as for\nits thermal energy.\nOn the other hand, a limited visibility in an interference measurement may be a signature for the presence\nof which-way information which in principle can be extracted from the system. In our cases, the which-way\ninformation must be stored in the motional degrees of\nfreedom of the ion, because it is the motion in the trap\nwhich determines the spatial size and shape of the wave\npacket of the ion.\nThe purpose of this paper is to present and compare\nthese various physical pictures and to show how thermal\n\n\f2\nmotion of the ion, resolution, visibility of interference\nfringes, and which-way information are related. We will\napply these ideas to analyse the three mentioned experiments and compare the experimental results. We will\ngive classical and quantum descriptions of the situations\nand show that, although their interpretations look rather\ndifferent, they are equally valid and lead to the same conclusions.\nWe focus here on the connection between ion motion,\ninterference, and resolution of the field structure. The\nquestion how the presence of a distant mirror affects the\ninternal dynamics of the ion has been discussed with a\nquantum model in Ref. [9].\n\nINTERFERENCE AND VISIBILITY\n\nFirst let us explain how in the three cases the observation of the standing wave can be interpreted as an interference between two processes. In the first experiment, a\nlaser excites the ion from one side, and photons scattered\nunder 90\u25e6 are detected, see Fig. 1a. A mirror is placed on\nthe opposite side (at \u221290\u25e6), such that photons scattered\ninto that direction are back-reflected and also sent into\nthe detector. Clearly the two pathways into the detector\nare indistinguishable and interfere, which is observed as\na modulation of the detector signal (photon count rate)\nvs. the distance between mirror and ion [1]. In the second\nexperiment, where light from a cavity mode is scattered\nby an ion [2], two scattering amplitudes corresponding\nto the two counterpropagating waves contribute to the\ndetection of a photon, see Fig. 1b. Depending on the\nion's position between the cavity mirrors, these amplitudes are superimposed in or out of phase, thus interfering constructively or destructively. The same explanation holds for the cavity-induced quadrupole excitation\n[3], only that here the two excitation pathways into the\nlong-lived upper state interfere, rather than two scattering amplitudes.\nA point-like probe would be able to map the interference fringes with perfect visibility, but with a real atom\nthe visibility will always be smaller. In the qualitative\ndiscussion above, we have already used one of the possible\nphysical pictures for this visibility reduction: The spatial\nwave packet of the ion probing the optical field structure\nacts as an apparatus function with which the ideal signal\n(of a point-like probe) has to be convoluted to find the\nexperimental signal. This particular \"spatial\" picture applies most intuitively to the cavity experiments. Taking\na \"temporal\" view, the two processes which interfere on\nthe detector may indeed have happened (at the ion) with\na delay between them, during which the ion has moved.\nThis is certainly true for the mirror experiment where one\npartial wave is delayed by the time it takes to the mirror\nand back, about 1.7 ns. The visibility will be reduced because the two interfering pathways do not find the ion in\n\nexactly the same state. There is also a \"spectral\" explanation for visibility reduction: The ion oscillates in the\ntrap so that, depending on the momentary Doppler shift,\nit sees (or scatters) the two travelling waves with different spectra. Only the overlapping spectral components\ncan interfere.\nFinally, there is a which-way interpretation. It takes\ninto account that a scattered or absorbed photon has a\nmechanical effect on the ion. On average, every scattering event will leave one photon recoil in the atom, such\nthat its motional state may change in the course of the\nprocess. This recoil, however, encodes with which of the\ntwo travelling waves the ion has interacted, and inasmuch\nas this information is stored in the ion, the visibility of\nthe interference will be diminished.\nWe will now develop these different pictures in detail\nand compare the conclusions to which they lead.\nION AS APPARATUS FUNCTION\n\nWhen we treat the wave packet of the ion as an effective apparatus function, the observed signal is calculated\nas follows. Let x denote the spatial coordinate along\nthe optical axis. The ideal signal from a point-like atom\nprobing the standing wave would be\n\u0001\nSideal (x) = 2S\u0304 cos2 (kx) = S\u0304 1 + cos(2kx) , (1)\n\nwhere S\u0304 is the average signal and k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb is the wave\nvector of the light. Now let \u03c1(x \u2212 x0 ) be the probability\nto find the ion at position x when the trap center is at\nx0 . Then the observed signal as a function of the trap\nposition x0 is\n\u0001\nS(x0 ) = S\u0304 1 + V cos(2kx0 ) ,\n(2)\nwhere\n\nV =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndx \u03c1(x) cos(2kx)\n\n(3)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nis the visibility of the interference fringes, in agreement\nwith the standard definition V = (Smax \u2212Smin )/(Smax +\nSmin ). We have used that \u03c1 is a symmetric function,\nwhich is certainly true for a harmonic trap. In fact, as\nwe will show later, in all cases which we treat here \u03c1 is a\nGaussian,\nx2\n1\n\u221a\nexp(\u2212 2 )\n(4)\n2\u03c3\n\u03c3 2\u03c0\nqR\n\u221e\n2\nwith rms spatial extension \u03c3 =\n\u2212\u221e dx x \u03c1(x). In this\ncase the visibility according to Eq. (3) is\n\u03c1(x) =\n\nV = exp(\u22122(k\u03c3)2 ) .\n\n(5)\n\nRelation (5) is used to determine the resolution from\na measured visibility.

(a) Back-reflection experiment [1] with Ba+ , relevant levels and laser wavelength.\n(b) Setup with ion scattering cavity light [2], relevant levels of Ca+ and laser wavelength. (c) Setup for quadrupole excitation\nby cavity light [3], relevant levels and lasers; after a pulse of cavity light (729 nm), the probability for excitation into D5/2\nis measured through state-selective fluorescence on the S1/2 to P1/2 transition (397 nm). In all experiments the typical\nmeasurement time is much larger than the oscillation period of the ion in the trap, \u03a9\u22121\nt .\n\nan upper limit for the true rms spatial extension of the\nion, as other broadening effects may be present in the\nexperiment. The values for the three experiments, as\ncalculated from the measured visibility values V = 72%\n[1], 40% [2], and 96.3% [3], are 32 nm, 43 nm, and 16 nm,\nrespectively. It should be noted that in Ref. [1] the actual\nwave packet size is estimated to be 21 nm [10], and the\nreduced visibility is partly due to optical aberrations. It\nshould also be mentioned that the larger number given\nin Ref.\u221a[2], 60 nm, is based on a different definition (by a\nfactor 2) of the spatial extension [11] and is consistent\nwith our result.\n\nDOPPLER EFFECT\n\nIn the case of the ion in front of a mirror, another\ndescription is particularly intuitive which accounts for\nthe time-dependent Doppler effect of the ion oscillating\nin the trap. This view highlights the role of both the\ndelay between the two partial waves before they reach the\ndetector, and of the spectral effect of the ion's motion.\nFirst we assume the ion to be oscillating classically\nwith frequency \u03a9t and amplitude xc , i.e. its momentary\nposition is x(t) = x0 + xc sin(\u03a9t t). The oscillation modulates the phases of the two partial waves E\u00b1 emitted\n\ntowards the detector (one directly, the other via the mirror) according to\nE\u00b1 (t) = E0 ei(kx0 \u00b1kxc sin(\u03a9t t)\u2212\u03c9t) .\n\n(6)\n\nThese two fields reach the detector with a phase delay\ne2ikL between them, where L is the distance between\ntrap center and mirror. The resulting detector signal is\nSc = |E0 |2 h|eikxc sin(\u03a9t t) + e2ikL e\u2212ikxc sin(\u03a9t t) |2 i ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere h i denotes time averaging over many periods of\nthe trap oscillation. Such an integration time T \u226b \u03a9\u22121\nt is\nused in all the experiments discussed and will be assumed\nthroughout our considerations. From Eq. (7) we get the\nvisibility reduction due to sinusoidal oscillation\n\u0001\nSc = S\u0304 1 + J0 (kxc ) cos(2kL) ,\n(8)\nwhere J0 is the zero-order Bessel function.\nA laser-cooled ion is not oscillating classically but in\na thermal state, i.e. its oscillation amplitude xc follows\na thermal probability distribution. This distribution is\nderived from the Boltzmann distribution for the ion's energy and is given by\nP (xc ) dxc =\n\nxc\nx2\nexp(\u2212 c2 ) dxc ,\n2\n\u03c3\n2\u03c3\n\n(9)\n\n\f4\nwhere \u03c3 is the rms spatial extension as before, related to\nthe thermal energy by Eth = M \u03a92t \u03c3 2 with ion mass M .\nCombining Eqs. (8) and (9) we get for the detector signal\n\u0001\nS(L) = S\u0304 1 + exp(\u22122(k\u03c3)2 ) cos(2kL)\n\n(10)\n\nin agreement with the previous result, Eq. (5). One\nfinds the same result when one evaluates first the spatial probability\np distribution for the classical oscillator,\nPc (x) = (\u03c0 x2c \u2212 x2 )\u22121 and integrates it with distribution (9), which yields the Gaussian of Eq. (4).\nThe picture of a Doppler effect is equally valid for\nthe light scattering from a cavity mode. In this case\nthe phase delay e2ikL between the two partial waves in\nEq. (7) is replaced by the relative phase between the two\ncounterpropagating waves in the cavity, which varies as\ne2ikx0 with the position x0 of the trap center in the standing wave (x0 = 0 is set to an antinode). In the same\nmanner it applies to the cavity-induced excitation. There\nEq. (7) is interpreted as the excitation probability when\natomic saturation effects are neglected, c.f. Ref. [3].\nThus the phase modulation through the Doppler effect\nand the spatial apparatus function are in fact only different pictures for the same situation, yielding in all cases\nthe same results for the visibility and the resolution.\n\nWHICH-WAY INFORMATION\n\nThe relation between fringe visibility and which-way\ninformation in an interference experiment is at the core\nof wave-particle duality. It has been the subject of several general studies [12], and it was recently studied in\nexperiments with atom interferometers [13, 14].\nWith a trapped ion probing an optical field, the encoding of which-way information happens through the recoil\nof an absorbed or an emitted photon. To illustrate this,\nwe will use the example of Fig. 1b where an ion scatters\ncavity light; later in this section we will show that the\nsame description applies to the other two experiments.\nFirst assume that before scattering the ion is at rest.\nDepending on the travelling wave from which a photon is\nabsorbed, the photon recoil will leave the ion oscillating\nwith a certain initial momentum, i.e. a certain phase. It is\nthis phase which carries the which-way information. The\nsecond part of the scattering process, the emission of the\nphoton into the detector, will always leave the same recoil\nkick and not introduce any further distinguishability.\nNow if every absorbed photon kicked the atom, the\ntwo final states pertaining to the two travelling waves\nwould always be different, and there would be no interference. This is the extreme case of a very shallow\ntrap (\u03a9t \u2192 0), where the two possible recoil momenta\naccelerate the ion to opposite sides, such that the two\nprocesses could be distinguished with certainty. Because\n\nof the trapping potential, however, a certain fraction of\nall absorption processes will leave the motional state unchanged. This is the so-called Lamb-Dicke effect [15], an\nimportant concept in laser cooling of trapped atoms [16].\nIt is this fraction of scattering events which creates the\ninterference.\nIn more detail, the recoil of the two travelling waves is\ntransferred to the ion's motional state by the spatial part\nof the respective electric field operators, e\u00b1ikx [17]. An\ninitial energy eigenstate |ni is thereby transformed into\na superposition of states according to\n|ni \u2192 e\u00b1ikx |ni .\n\n(11)\n\nThe overlap hn|e2ikx |ni of these two possible final states\nis expected to determine the visibility of the interference.\nUsing Eq. (11), the rate at which an ion would scatter\nphotons from one single travelling wave into the detector\nis given by [18]\nX\nX\nSRW = Srest\nP (n)\n|hk|e\u00b1ikx |ni|2 ,\n(12)\nn\n\nk\n\nwhere Srest is the scattering rate for an ion at rest,\nand P (n) = n\u0304n /(n\u0304 + 1)n+1 is a Boltzmann distribution\nover the harmonic oscillator states [19]. For a standing wave, the matrix element in Eq. (12) is replaced by\nhk|2 cos(k(x \u2212 x0 ))|ni, where x0 is the position of the ion\nrelative to an antinode as before. This yields for the scattering rate from the standing wave, as a function of the\nion's position,\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\nP (n)hn| cos(2k(x \u2212 x0 ))|ni .\nS(x0 ) = 2Srest 1 +\nn\n\n(13)\nSince the spatial eigenfunctions |ni have definite parity,\nand using 2Srest = S\u0304, we get the interference signal\n\u0001\nS(x0 ) = S\u0304 1 + V cos(2kx0 ) ,\n(14)\nwhere the visibility is given by\nX\nV =\nP (n)hn| cos(2kx)|ni .\n\n(15)\n\nn\n\nSince hn| cos(2kx)|ni = hn|e2ikx |ni, we find that the visibility of the interference fringes is indeed equal to the\n(thermally averaged) overlap of the two possible final\nstates e\u00b1ikx |ni of the individual processes, just as the\nwhich-way interpretation suggests [20].\nThe same arguments are readily applied to the other\ntwo experiments: In the case of Fig. 1c, the photon recoil enters in exactly the same way, only the signal S(x0 )\ndescribes the position-dependent transition probability\ninto the upper state. In the case displayed in Fig. 1a,\nit is the recoil of the emitted photons which encodes\nthe which-way information according to their direction\nof emission, while absorption always happens from the\n\n\f5\nsame travelling-wave laser beam and has no further effect.\nFinally, we can evaluate Eq. (15) using the properties\nof the harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions [21], and we find\nV = exp(\u22122(k\u03c3)2 )\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is again the rms spatial extension of the ion, now\ncalculated from the\nP thermal distribution over the quantum states, \u03c3 2 = n P (n)hn|x2 |ni = (2n\u0304 + 1)h0|x2 |0i.\nResult (16) is in perfect agreement with Eq. (5) for the\nclassical apparatus function and Eq. (10) for the timedependent Doppler effect. This confirms that the whichway interpretation which accounts for the photon recoil is\nindeed an equally valid physical picture for the situation\nin the three experiments and that it leads to the same\nconclusions.\nEq. (15), in analogy with Eq. (3), can also be read as\nthe Fourier transform of the thermal wave packet,\nZ \u221e\n\u0010X\n\u0011\nV =\ndx\n(17)\nP (n)|\u03c8n (x)|2 cos(2kx) ,\n\u2212\u221e\n\nn\n\nwhere \u03c8n (x) = hx|ni is the spatial representation of the\nnth harmonic oscillator eigenfunction. Comparison with\nEq. (16) confirms that the thermal spatial probability\ndistribution is a Gaussian, as we assumed earlier.\nWe would like to note that the dependence of the visibility on the extension of the motional wave function,\nEq. (16), implies a limited visibility also for an atom in\nthe motional ground state. This should be experimentally observable, e.g. in the case of Fig. 1c, when the\nprobing of the cavity field is combined with ground state\ncooling techniques. The dependence of the visibility on\nthe ground state extension for different trapping strength\nwould illustrate nicely the quantum limit of confinement\nof an atom, and it would be another fundamental demonstration of Bohr's moving slit experiment, similar to the\nwork of Ref. [14].\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented several physical pictures for the\nprobing of an optical field structure by a single trapped\natom, and investigated the factors that limit the spatial\nresolution. We used three recent experiments as examples, where a standing wave structure was detected by a\nsingle trapped ion.\nThe detection of a standing wave involves the interference between the two absorption or scattering processes\npertaining to the two travelling waves, therefore the spatial resolution is connected to the visibility of the interference fringes. We have given several different explanations\nhow a limitation of the visibility arises: The spatial probability distribution of the trapped atom can be regarded\n\nto act as an apparatus function with which the ideal,\nfull-contrast signal is convoluted. The ion's oscillation\nin the trap can also be considered to create periodically\nphase-modulated light fields, of which only the unshifted\ncomponents interfere. Finally, the possible modification\nof the ion's motional state by the photon recoil of the two\ntravelling waves can be considered to encode which-way\ninformation in the ion.\nThese seemingly different pictures lead to identical\nconclusions regarding their effect on the visibility, which\nshows that they are indeed only different interpretations\nof the same physical situation.\nOur study is not at all limited to a standing wave. This\nsimple case only helps to highlight the relations of more\ngeneral validity, between phase modulation, spatial probability distribution, and in particular the interpretation\nof the photon recoil as which-way information.\nAcknowledgements.
