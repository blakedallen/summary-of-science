The study of vortex structures, spatial and temporal correlations, and vortex-antivortex\npairs formation gives insight into a purely collective mechanism behind the current reversal effect.\nPACS numbers: 74.81.Fa, 74.25.Qt, 85.25.Cp\n\nRatchet systems constitute a vast subject of present\ninterest, extensively studied from biology to a wide spectrum of fields in physics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Very recently,\npromising applications in micro-nano technology have\nmotivated a huge amount of additional works, mainly regarding the controlled motion of nanoparticles, colloids,\nelectrons or magnetic flux quanta. The main characteristic of these systems is their ability to transport particles\nwith a non-zero drift velocity in the absence of any net\nmacroscopic force. The simplest realization of this idea\nis the rectification of an ac-driven single particle motion\nin an asymmetric periodic potential or ratchet potential,\nknown as a rocking ratchet. Ratchet effect in superconductors (SC) has been, in particular, an attractive subject of study since the proposal of using it to remove undesirable trapped vortices producing noise in SC devices\n[6]. Notably, several designs of asymmetric pinning potentials for the motion of flux quanta have been recently\nrealized, such as dots-antidots arrays of pinning sites in\nSC films [7]. Even more, ratchet designs without spatial\nasymmetry have been successfully achieved in layered SC\n[8]. Small Josephson junction (JJ) systems were investigated as well: SQUIDs [9], 1D ladders[10, 11], long JJ\n[12] and quasi-1D quantum JJA [13]. In particular, on\nclassical JJA, the first design of a device for kinks motion\nrectification was proposed [10] and measured [11] in 1D.\nLarge 2D JJA, which are excellent systems to study\nstatistical mechanics experimentally [14] and where collective effects could play a relevant role, had not been\nstudied until very recently. Rectification experiments on\n2D JJA were reported by Shal\u00f3m and Pastoriza [15].\nThey modulated the distance between the SC islands\nthus generating a ratchet potential for vortex motion.\nDc-voltage rectification was then clearly observed and\nits intriguing features, such as a non trivial dependence\non both, the applied ac current and vortex density, and\nan inversion of the vortex flow direction, prompt further\ninvestigation. The aim of this work is to interpret such\nexperiments and understand the role of collective effects.\nWe show numerically that the overdamped RSJ model\nfor large 2D JJA with asymmetrically modulated critical currents, reproduces successfully the experiments [15]\n\nand allows for a detailed characterization of the device\nuseful for performance enhancement and future experiments. In addition, a complete study of the vortex dynamics gives insight into a non trivial collective mechanism behind the current reversal (CR) effect.\nWe study the overdamped vortex dynamics in square\n2D asymmetrically modulated JJA using the resistively\nshunted junction (RSJ) model [16] and solving numerically the superconducting phase dynamics. The current\nflowing in the junction between two superconducting islands is the sum of the Josephson supercurrent and the\n\u2202\u03b8\u03bc (n)\n\u03a60\n+\nnormal current: I\u03bc (n) = I0 sin \u03b8\u03bc (n) + 2\u03c0cR\n\u2202t\nN\n\u03b7\u03bc (n, t), where I0 is the critical current of the junction between the two superconducting islands sited in n and n+\n\u03bc on a square lattice [n=(nx , ny ), \u03bc=x\u0302, \u0177], \u03b8\u03bc (n)=\u03b8(n +\n\u03bc) \u2212 \u03b8(n) \u2212 A\u03bc (n) the gauge invariant phase difference\nR\n2\u03c0 (n+\u03bc)a\nwith A\u03bc (n)= \u03a6\nA*dl, \u03a60 the flux quantum, a the\nna\n0\nlattice parameter, and RN the normal state resistance.\nUnder a magnetic field H, we have \u2206\u03bc \u00d7 A\u03bc (n)= 2\u03c0f ,\nf =Ha2 /\u03a60 being the frustration parameter, a measure\nof the vortex density. The Langevin noise term \u03b7\u03bc models\nthe contact with a thermal bath at temperature T and\nsatisfies h\u03b7\u03bc (n, t)\u03b7\u03bc\u2032 (n\u2032 , t\u2032 )i= 2kRBNT \u03b4\u03bc,\u03bc\u2032 \u03b4n,n\u2032 \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ). The\nratchet potential for vortices is introduced by modulating\nthe critical currents I0 =EJ \u03a60 /2\u03c0, EJ being the Josephson coupling energy between islands. We consider a sawtooth modulation I0 (nx ) increasing linearly from I0min\nto I0max within each period, p, as an approximation to\nthe experimental modulation. The ratchet potential amplitude is then measured by \u2206U \u221d \u2206I0 =(I0max \u2212 I0min ).\nThe system is driven by Iext =Iac sin(2\u03c0\u03c9ac t) in the \u0177\ndirection. Periodic boundary conditions in both directions are taken (see model details in [17]). The dynamical equations for the superconducting phases are obtained after considering conservation of the current in\neach node. The resulting set of Langevin equations are\nsolved using a 2nd order Runge-Kutta algorithm with\ntime step \u2206t=0.1\u03c4J (\u03c4J =2\u03c0cRN I0 /\u03a60 , where I0 is the\naveraged critical current) and integration time 2.106\u03c4J\nafter the equilibration transient.

Currents are normalized by I0 , voltages by RN I0 , temperature by EJ /kB and frequencies by\n(\u03c4J )\u22121 . Most of the results shown are (except indication)\nfor p=8, I0min =0.5I0 , I0max =1.5I0 , \u03c9ac =10\u22124 , T =0.05\nand 32\u00d732 arrays. Other parameters as p=7, 10, 15\nand \u2206I0 =0.5, 1.5, 2 were as well investigated. The full\nrange of magnetic field was explored, from a single vortex to the fully frustrated case (f =1/2) in system with\nL=Lx=Ly =32, 64, 100, 128.\nResults. In Fig.1 we show mean dc-voltage, hVdc i, vs\nthe amplitude of the ac current, Iac , for different vortex densities, f . These results imply rectification: a net\ndirectional vortex motion parallel to the ratchet modulation in response to an alternating force. For low f , hVdc i\nis maximum at an optimal value of Iac and decreases\nslowly for larger Iac as the ratchet potential is effectively\nwashed out by the fast vortex motion. This behavior is\nqualitatively the one expected for a single particle rocking ratchet system [2]. Let us note however that even for\nhighly diluted vortex systems the intensity of rectification\nis not additive: for example with f =1/32 in a 32 \u00d7 32\narray we have 32 vortices but as we can see in Fig.1 the response is \u223c12 times, and not 32 times the response of one\nsingle vortex (f =1/L2). This non-additivity is even more\npronounced for higher f . By increasing frustration from\nf =1/32 to f =1/2 the rectification peak presents both a\nreduction and a shift of the optimal Iac value. A more\nintriguing feature appears when f is further increased.\nFor 0.17 . f < 1/2 an inversion of the vortex flow direction is observed at small Iac values and the window\nwith hVdc i < 0 becomes wider as f is increased. The non\nmonotonic behavior observed as a function of f is a clear\nevidence that vortex-vortex interactions are relevant for\nthe rectification effect at all f . On the other hand it\nis well known that the frustrated XY-model, equivalent\nto our model for 2D JJA under an external H [14], can\n\nFIG. 2: (a) hVdc i vs Iac for f =1/4 and f =3/4.

(c) Experimental\ncontours at T=3.8K, \u03c9ac =1kHz and V0 =15nV (see [15]).\n\nalso present a finite density of thermally excited vortexantivortex pairs, nva =(h|b(\u00f1)|i \u2212 f )/2, over the magnetic\nfield induced vortex pattern. It is then important to\nunderstand its contribution to the ratchet effect. In the\ninset of Fig.1 we plot both hVdc i and nva /f vs Iac for\nf =1/32. We see that nva increases monotonically and\nsaturates to 10% of f at Iac \u223c 0.8. We find the same behavior for all f but the saturation value of nva decreases\nwith increasing f , being less than 0.01f for f > 1/8. We\nconclude that the effect of pairs is almost negligible in the\nCR regime, but it is relevant for diluted vortex lattices\nat large applied currents and they must be considered to\nreproduce properly the experimental rectification tails.\nA summary of our numerical results on voltage rectification vs vortex density is presented in Fig.2 in\ncomparison with experiments [15].\nIn Fig.2(a) we\nshow numerical curves for f =1/4 and f =1\u2212f =3/4.\nFrom the symmetries of the frustrated XY Hamiltonian: H(f )=H(\u2212f )=H(1 \u2212 f ) [14], we expect symmetrical transport properties around f =1/2. Since vortex\nand antivortex motion is rectified in the same direction\nwe have hVdc i(f )=\u2212hVdc i(1\u2212f ). This means that in the\n0 \u2264 f \u2264 1/2 range of magnetic field the dissipation\narises from the motion of \"positive\" vortices while the\nflux of \"negative\" vortices (antivortices) yields dissipation in the 1/2 \u2264 f \u2264 1 range. In Fig.2(b) contour plots\nof hVdc i show the occurrence of voltage rectification in the\nIac \u2212 f plane. Current reversals occur only in the regime\nof strong vortex repulsion around f =1/2, in a single interval, 0.17 . f < 0.5. Comparing Fig.2(b-c) we see a\ngood qualitative agreement with experiments.\nFor applications it is also important to accurately\ndetermine the range of parameters where rectification\nwould be observable. In Fig.3(a) we see a well defined\nsaturation plateau for hVdc i at low frequencies.

Then we\npredict an observable rectification up to \u223c100kHz in\ngood agreement with [15], if we use typical parameters,\nRN =0.01\u03a9 and I0 =1\u03bcA, to estimate our unit of frequency (\u03c4J )\u22121 \u223c30MHz. Rectification can also depend\non the parameters of the ratchet potential. In Fig.3(b)\nwe see that hVdc i monotonically increase with \u2206I0 for\nall Iac , and the optimal rectification increase approximatively linearly for 1.5 . \u2206I0 . 2 (see inset) and for\n\u2206I0 \u223c 2 inversion disappears [19]. We thus see that\nthe ratchet effect could be experimentally improved up\nto one order of magnitude by modulating accordingly the\nJosephson couplings. On the other hand we find that rectification has no appreciable changes for the experimental values p=7,10,15 nor sharp commensurability effects\nbetween f and p. We also analyze the range of temperature where rectification occurs and size effects. We find\na wide range of applicability, 0 \u2264 T . 0.4, what makes\nJJA advantageous and that the main characteristics of\nour results are almost size independent for L > 32 [19].\nIn order to understand collective transport effects and\nin particular current reversal, we study vortex structures\nand spatial and temporal correlations. In Fig.4(a-b) we\nshow vorticity snapshots for f =1/8, 3/4 at Iac = 0 illustrating the competition between the ratchet potential, which induces a modulated vortex density, and\nthe repulsive vortex-vortex interaction that favors a\nuniform vortex density. For all f we find that vortices organize in dense vortex walls strongly pinned at\nthe sawtooth minima. Interestingly, when CR starts,\nthe static vortex structure present an averaged number of vortices in the walls similar to a checkerboard\npattern, i.e. hnv/wall i\u223cLy /2. The degree of periodic order is reflected by the intensity of the peaks at\nk=(n2\u03c0/p,\nof the averaged vortex\nstructure factor\nE\nD 0)\nP\n2\nshown in Fig.4(c).

In\nFig.5 we show examples of typical voltage response vs\ntime during a period at which its steady value hVdc i (see\nFig.2(a)) is already achieved. The amplitude of the almost symmetrical temporal oscillations around Vt =0 is\nmuch larger, one order of magnitude, than hVdc i for all\nIac . This implies that rectification arises from tiny differences between the two directions of motion and explains\nthe low efficiency of the device and the need of very large\n\u22121\n\u03c4ac =\u03c9ac\nto resolve the effect. The dc-limit analysis con-\n\n\f4\nfirms this result [19]. Insets (a),(b) in Fig.5 show b(\u00f1)\nsnapshots at time [0,0.25]\u03c4ac respectively. Most of the\ntime the moving vortex lattice is highly disordered (as\nseen at t/\u03c4ac =0.25), except for small forces close to depinning (as in t/\u03c4ac \u223c0) where the ratchet-induced periodicity is more visible. This fluctuating order produces\nthe small peaks in the averaged structure factor showed\nin Fig.4(d). In Fig.5(c) voltage power spectrum for different vortex densities are analyzed. Time correlations\nappear clearly at \u03c9ac and higher harmonics, as it is expected for one particle in a ratchet potential. Note however that interactions modify the harmonics structure,\nas it is seen comparing f =3/4 with more diluted vortex\nlattices, f =1/8 and f =1/16 where more harmonic peaks\nappear. We thus see that temporal order is only determined by the ac-drive as it is expected for vortices moving\nincoherently. No trace of a washboard frequency is observed for any f nor Iac . Therefore no dynamical phase\ntransitions are induced by the ac-drive and the system\nbehaves as a modulated driven plasma.\nDiscussion. Our results present some similarities\nbut also some marked differences with other 2D vortex\nratchet systems. First, let us note that inverted rectification appears only at low drives within a single range\nof high f around f =1/2 (Fig.2). This is similar to CR\nobserved in arrays of dots in SC films by Villegas et al.\n[7], but their explanation based on interstitial vortices\nmoving over an inverted ratchet potential, is not suitable\nfor JJA as interstitial can not be defined. Our results are\nalso different to the multiple CRs observed and explained\nby de Souza Silva et al. in SC films with antidots arrays\n[7]. The differences can be attributed to the strong pinning generated by dots or antidots, which can localize a\nfew vortices in very small regions and produce a very coherent individual motion. In our case an extended weak\npotential pins and deforms collectively the vortex density\nalthough individual vortex motion remains highly incoherent. In addition, underdamped dynamics was also\nshown to provide CR [7]. In our case no evidence of an\neffective dynamically induced inertia is found however,\nas no hysteresis in Fig.1, nor out of phase voltage response is observed, Fig.5. CR in JJA thus presents novel\nfeatures deserving discussion.\nSince CR is observed near the onset of dissipation, an\nanalysis of the asymmetric depinning is useful. In the\nabsence of vortex interactions it is clear that the critical current in the easy direction of the ratchet potential,\neasy\nIdep\n\u223c \u2206U/(p \u2212 1) is smaller than the one in the hard\nhard\ndirection Idep\n\u223c \u2206U . Therefore the onset of rectificaeasy\ntion occurs when Iac \u223c Idep\nwith a net motion in the\neasy direction. In presence of interactions the situation\ncan be rather different [7], since vortices tend to screen\nthe ratchet potential thus modifying the critical currents\nand mobility of single vortex excitations in each direction differently. It is clear that a small tilt of the ratchet\npotential in the hard direction produces well defined walls\n\nwith a high vortex density at the local minima of the\nsawtooth. On the contrary a tilt in the easy direction\nfavors a smoother vortex density profile. Calculating the\nforce exerted on a vortex by a periodic array of vortex\nhard\nwalls we can easily show that Idep\nis reduced by an\namount proportional to the vortex density at the walls,\neasy\nhard\nI \u0303dep\n=\u2206U \u2212 \u03b1fwall , while in the easy direction Idep\nremains unchanged. Hence, CR can occur above a critical\neasy\nhard\nvortex density, fc , such that I \u0303dep\n=Idep\nat fc , yieldp\u22122\n(\n).\nThis\nsimple\nargument\nis consistent\ning fc \u223c \u2206U\n\u03b1 p\u22121\nwith the fact that inversion is observed at high f , disappears with increasing \u2206U and is weakly dependent on\np (details and dc limit confirming this scenario in [19]).\nAt larger Iac the dynamical smoothening of the vortex\ndensity reduces the screening and the easy direction for\nrectification is recovered. Fig.1 shows that this recovering occurs at higher Iac for higher f , consistent with\nthe existence of denser walls at high f . Our results thus\nshow that vortex-vortex interactions can overscreen the\nasymmetry of the ratchet potential as was noted in [7]\nbut the mechanism is purely collective, since individual\nvortex motion is highly incoherent like in a driven modulated fluid. Indeed, this effect could be relevant for a wide\nfamily of interacting many-body ratchet systems [19].\nI acknowledge useful discussions with P. Martinoli,\nA.B. Kolton, D.
