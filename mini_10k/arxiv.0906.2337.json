The system is also studied numerically. In particular,\nwe study the anomalous diffusion exponent in the low temperature regime.

Introduction\nComputing bulk transport properties in random media is an important physical problem [1, 2,\n3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] having many applications. Two important models of random media have been\nwidely studied (i) where the randomness is due to a random potential and (ii) where the local\ndiffusions constant is random. There are mathematical relations between the problems (i) and\n(ii) and problems of type (ii) are also related to a wide variety of physical problems such as the\neffective conductivity and dielectric constants of random conductors and dielectrics and the effective\npermeability of porous media [1]. An important quantity to understand those properties is the late\ntime diffusion constant of a Brownian tracer particle in interaction with the medium. In the system\nwe will study, the local transport properties are modified by the interaction of the dipole moment\nof the tracer particle with a random electric field drawn from an appropriate statistical ensemble.\nIf the electric field disorder is statistically invariant under translation and short range correlated in\nspace, we expect that the diffusion constant and mobility due to an applied force are self-averaging\nin the regime where the diffusion is normal. If the transport is normal, then in the long time limit\n(t \u2192 \u221e), the mean squared displacement of the particle position behaves as\nh(x(t) \u2212 x(0))2 i \u223c 2D\u03bae t,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere D is the dimension of space and \u03bae is the late time diffusion or effective diffusion\nconstant. In general there are subdominant corrections to the above, which depend strongly on the\ndimensionality of the problem [9, 10].\nIf the random field is frozen or evolves over very long time scales with respect to those of the tracer\nparticle, then one is in the situation of quenched disorder, where the potential does not depend on\ntime. The motivation for studying models of particles diffusing in a random potential comes from\nthe fact that such systems arise very naturally in nature; for instance in zeolites where random\nelectric fields are generated by the presence of frozen charged impurities [11]. If the particle has a\nnet charge, then the particle interacts with the electric field and the case of diffusion in a quenched\nscalar field has been extensively studied in the literature [1, 2, 3, 10, 12]. However, if the particle\nis polarizable but without charge, it also interacts with the field. In this case, the problem is quite\ndifferent and much less well studied [12, 13]. We also note that systems with quenched disorder,\nspin glasses for example, are often good paradigms for systems having structural glass transition\n(where no random field is present). It is often argued heuristically, that for sufficiently complex\nand frustrated systems, a single particle in the system sees an effectively random potential due\nto the other particles. At a mean field level, there exist models, where this analogy has been\nused successfully to analyze the statistical mechanics of frustrated but non-disordered models. In\npractice one can have two models, one with quenched disorder and the other without but highly\nfrustrated, which exhibit the same thermodynamics in the high temperature phase and the same\nglass transition at low temperatures [14, 15, 16]. Even if the frustrated non-random system possesses\na crystalline ground state, not shared by the disordered system, this fact is practically irrelevant as\nthis state is dynamically never attained. Therefore, these models are often adopted as toy models\nfor structural glass transition. In the liquid phase, we expect the tracer particle to have a non-zero\ndiffusion constant \u03bal . Now consider the situation in which the same particle diffuses in a quenched\nbackground, where all the other particles have been frozen in a particular configuration. A realistic\nchoice would be to select a configuration from a Gibbs-Boltzmann equilibrium ensemble. If \u03bae is\nthe diffusion constant, it has been shown [17, 18] that \u03bae < \u03bal which makes physical sense, as if the\n\n\fDipole diffusion in a random electrical potential\n\n3\n\nbackground particles can move about, the cages, which trap the tracer , will break up on some time\nscale and free it to disperse more quickly than in the quenched case. Moreover, in some special\ncases, \u03bae can vanish at a critical temperature or disorder strength [10, 12]. If the system has a\nfinite correlation length l0 (which will be the case, as our field will be short range correlated), the\ndiffusion constant can be used to give an effective relaxation time \u03c4\n\u03c4\u223c\n\nl02\n.\n\u03bae\n\n(2)\n\nIf \u03bae \u2192 0, it means, that we have a diverging timescale in the same way in which a structural\nglass has a diverging timescale which, experimentally, can be extracted from the divergence of the\nliquid's viscosity.\nIn this paper we study the physical case of dipoles diffusing in a random electric field E(x) which\nis spatially varying though time independent (or quenched). It is generated by a random potential\n\u03c6(x) which gives E(x) = \u2212\u2207\u03c6(x), with correlation function\nh\u03c6(x)\u03c6(x\u2032 )i = \u2206(|x \u2212 x\u2032 |).\n\n(3)\n\nThe potential \u03c6(x) is thus statistically isotropic and invariant by translation in space. The most\nconvenient choice is to take \u03c6 to be Gaussian. If the dipole moment, denoted by p, is modelled\nas two opposite charges connected to a Harmonic spring and x denotes the position of the dipole\ncentre, then the total energy of a particle at the point (p, x) is given by\nH(x, p) =\n\n1 2\np \u2212 p * E(x).\n2\u03c7\n\n(4)\n\nThe first term is the Harmonic energy of the spring, and \u03c7 is simply the dipole polarisability. The\nsecond term is the energy of the dipole's interaction with the field E. The partition function for\nthe system, where x is confined to a volume denoted by V of a D dimensional space, is given, up\nto an overall factor, by\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nZ\np2\n+ \u03b2p * E(x) ,\n(5)\nZ=\ndx\ndp exp \u2212\u03b2\n2\u03c7\nV\nRD\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/kB T is the inverse temperature. If we trace over the dependence on p, we find an\neffective partition function for the variable x given, again up to a constant, by\nZ\nZef f =\ndx exp (\u2212\u03b2V (x)) ,\n(6)\nV\n\nwhere V is the effective potential for x and is given by\n\n\u03c7E2 (x)\n.\n(7)\n2\nThis represents the case where the dipole moment adapt instantaneously to the external field and\nmotivated the study in [10, 12] of diffusion in non-Gaussian potentials. In [10] the diffusion constant\nfor a particle diffusing in non Gaussian potentials such as given by equation (7) was computed\nexactly in one dimension, and in [12] a self renormalization group scheme was developed to study\nthe problem in higher dimensions.\nV (x) = \u2212\n\nIn [10, 12] a critical temperature at which the diffusion constant vanishes, signalling a dynamical\ntransition from a normal diffusive regime to a subdiffusive regime was identified. We thus expect\n\n\f4\n\nDipole diffusion in a random electrical potential\n\nthat, in a suitable adiabatic limit where the dynamics of the dipole degree of freedom p is much\nmore rapid than that of the spatial variable x, that the effective potential seen by the variable x is\nV as defined by equation (7).\nIf we take an overdamped Langevin dynamics for both the dipole and positional degrees of freedom,\nthe equations of motion are given by\n\u2202Ej \u221a\ndxi\n+ 2\u03bax \u03b7xi\n= \u03b2\u03bax pj\ndt\n\u2202xi\n\u0013\n\u0012\np\ndpi\npi\n= \u2212 \u03bap \u03b2\n\u2212 Ei + 2\u03bap \u03b7pi .\ndt\n\u03c7\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nIn the above equations \u03bax is the bare diffusion constant for the spatial variable and the other\ndiffusion constant \u03bap sets the time scale for the relaxation of the dipole and the adiabatic limit\nis where \u03bap \u2192 \u221e. In the dynamical equations (8) and (9), terms of the form Ai represent the\ncomponent of the vector A in the direction i ; we have also used the Einstein summation convention\nand will stick with this convention throughout the paper. The noise terms are white noise and their\ncorrelation functions are given by\nh\u03b7pi (t)\u03b7pj (s)i = h\u03b7xi (t)\u03b7xj (s)i = \u03b4ij \u03b4(t \u2212 s) and h\u03b7pi (t)\u03b7xj (s)i = 0.\n\n(10)\n\nIf we rewrite (9) and substitute it into equation (8) we find\n\u221a\ndxi\n\u2202 \u03c7Ej2\n\u03bax \u2202Ej\n\u03c7\n= 2\u03bax \u03b7xi + \u03bax \u03b2\n\u2212\ndt\n\u2202xi 2\n\u03bap \u2202xi\n\n\u0012\n\ndpj p\n\u2212 2\u03bap \u03b7pj\ndt\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nIf we now take the adiabatic limit (\u03bap \u226b \u03bax ), equation (11) reduces to the Langevin equation for a\nparticle in the potential V (x) defined by equation (7). In appendix A, we will rederive this result in\na more rigorous way and also see, at first order, the effect of a finite value of \u03bap . We thus expect, that\nfor very large values of \u03bap , we find the same dynamics for x studied in [10, 12, 13]. Consequently\nthere should also be a dynamical transition in this problem when the field \u03c6 is Gaussian. We can\nnow ask the question, what happens if the time scale for the relaxation of the dipole moment is\nnon zero? Will the dynamical transition remain or is it a pathology of the limit \u03bap \u2192 \u221e?\nIn the appendix A we derive the effective dynamics for the marginal distribution of x to order \u03bax /\u03bap .\nTo this order the effective dynamics of x still can be described by a Langevin equation, with the\nsame potential as equation (7) but with a spatially varying non-isotropic diffusion constant. This\nis a rather remarkable fact and can be shown using operator projection techniques [19]. However\nwe will present a derivation based on a direct manipulation of the Langevin equations similar to\nthat of [20]. We chose this route as it gives a physical feeling for why the effective process for x\nis to this order Markovian and also because the computation in spaces of dimension greater than\none are more straightforward within this formalism. We also compute the first order corrections to\nthe effective diffusion constant in the high temperature limit via a Kubo formula for the effective\ndiffusion constant.\nIn section (3) we will present exact result for the diffusion constant in one dimension. In section\n(4) we will confront our results with numerical simulation (stochastic second order Runge-Kutta)\nof the coupled Langevin equations (8) and (9) in the diffusive and sub-diffusive regime. Finally in\nsection 5 we will conclude and discuss our results.\n\n\f5\n\nDipole diffusion in a random electrical potential\n2. Large \u03bap and small \u03b2 approximations\n\nThe time scale for the relaxation of the dipoles should be proportional to \u03ba\u22121\np and thus, the adiabatic\nlimit (where the dipoles adapt very quickly to the local field) will correspond to the limit where \u03bap\nbecomes large. Interestingly, in this limit, one can simplify the coupled equations (8) and (9) to an\neffective Langevin equation for x up to the order O(\u03bax /\u03bap ) by direct manipulation of the Langevin\nequations [20]. The exact derivation is a little long and technical and for clarity's sake it is thus\ngiven in appendix A. As a result, we can write down the following Fokker-Planck equation which\ndescribe the effective process for x\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202V\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u03baki\n.\n(12)\n+ \u03b2\u03c1\n= H\u03c1 =\n\u2202t\n\u2202xk\n\u2202xi\n\u2202xi\nWhere V is the effective potential given by equation (7) and \u03baij is a spatially varying and anisotropic\ndiffusivity tensor given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03bax 2 \u2202Ek \u2202Ek\n.\n(13)\n\u03c7\n\u03baij = \u03bax \u03b4ij \u2212\n\u03bap\n\u2202xi \u2202xj\nThe Fokker-Planck equation (12) has the correct Gibbs Boltzmann equilibrium distribution with\nthe effective potential V and from this one can write down a Langevin equation which corresponds\nto the process\np\ndxi\n\u2202 \u03c7Ej2\n\u2202\n\u03baij + 2\u03baij \u03b7i .\n= \u2212\u03b2\n+\ndt\n\u2202xi 2\n\u2202xi\n\n(14)\n\nWe note that if we take the limit where \u03bap \u2192 \u221e in (14), the diffusivity reduce to \u03baij = \u03bax \u03b4ij\nand we recover the Langevin equation for a particle in the potential V (x) rigorously. In equation\n(A.21) of appendix A we performed an expansion in \u03b1\u22121 (with \u03b1 = \u03bap \u03b2/\u03c7) and assumed \u03b1 to\nbe large. However if \u03bap is large but finite we see that as \u03b2 becomes small (the high temperature\nlimit) the expansion will fail.

Analytic results in one dimension\nIn the previous section, all the results we derived were for an arbitrary dimension D. To analyze our\nresults to first order beyond the adiabatic limit, we will restrict our study to the one dimensional\ncase where one can compute exactly the diffusion constant \u03bae for the effective Fokker-Planck\nequation (12). We apply the general results of [1] to compute the effective diffusivity via a static\nproblem:\n\u0013\n\u0012\ndV\nd\u03c1\n= j,\n(27)\n+ \u03b2\u03c1\n\u03ba(x)\ndx\ndx\nwhere j is the current and \u03ba(x) is the spatially varying diffusivity in one dimension\n\"\n\u00132 #\n\u0012\n\u03bax 2 dE(x)\n.\n\u03c7\n\u03ba(x) = \u03bax 1 \u2212\n\u03bap\ndx\n\n(28)\n\nWe can solve (27) and find\nx\n\ne\u03b2V (y)\ndy\n(29)\n\u03ba(y)\n0\nD E\nd\u03c1\nThe diffusion constant \u03bae is then given as \u03bae dx\n= j.

The electrical potential\n\u03c6(x) is Gaussian and if we choose a correlator of the form \u2206(x) = f (x2 ), where f is analytic at\n\n\fDipole diffusion in a random electrical potential\n\n8\n\nx = 0, then we find that E 2 (0) = \u22122f \u2032 (0), and hE \u2032 (0)E(0)i = 0. Therefore, E \u2032 and E are\nuncorrelated and we can write\n\u22121\n\n\u03bae =\n\n\u03ba\u22121\n.\nhe\u2212\u03b2V i he\u03b2V i\n\n(32)\n\nIn [10] (corresponding to the adiabatic case here) it was shown that the dynamical transition could\nbe identified, via an Arrhenius type argument, with the divergence of one or the other of the first\ntwo terms on the denominator of the equation above. We thus see that to first order beyond\nthe adiabatic approximation the location of the transition temperature should be the same in the\nadiabatic limit and close to this limit.\nIn the numerical simulations we will carry out we take the choice of correlation function f (u) =\nexp(\u2212 21 u) for which we find\n\u03bae = \u03bax (1 \u2212 \u03c72 \u03b2 2 )1/2 (1 \u2212\n\n\u03ba x \u03c72\n).\n\u03bap\n\n(33)\n\n4. Numerical simulations\nIn this section we test our analytical predictions against numerical simulations of the Langevin\nequations (8) and (9) in one dimension. In our simulation, we set the diffusion constant without\n\u221a\n\u221a\ndisorder \u03bax to 1 for convenience and we used rescaled variables pi = p\u0303i \u03bap and Ei = \u1ebci \u03bap , so\nthat both equations have the same time scale,\ndxi\n\u2202 \u1ebcj \u221a\n+ 2\u03b7xi\n= \u03b2\u03bap p\u0303j\ndt\n\u2202xi\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221a\ndp\u0303i\np\u0303i\n= \u2212 \u03bap \u03b2\n\u2212 \u1ebci + 2\u03b7pi\ndt\n\u03c7\n\n(34)\n(35)\n\nThe coupled stochastic differential equations were integrated using second order Runge-Kutta\nintegration schemes developed in [24, 25] and reviewed in [1] with a time step \u2206t = 0.001. In\nall simulations the effective diffusion constant for a given realization of the disorder was obtained\nby fitting the mean squared displacement averaged over 2000 particles at late times. The time of\nthe simulation was chosen so that particles had typically diffused ten or so correlation lengths of\nthe field. The fit of the average mean square displacement was done over the last half of the time\nof the simulation (to ensure that the mean squared displacement is well within the linear regime)\nby a non linear form: at + bt\u03b8 , with \u03b8 < 1. The correction to the linear term has to be taken into\naccount as it becomes more and more relevant close to the transition due to the slowing down of\nthe dynamics [10].\nTo generate the Gaussian field characterized by a correlator (3), we used the technique presented\nin [26, 27]. The process can be written in a general form\nZ +\u221e\nK(x \u2212 x\u2032 )\u03b7(x\u2032 ) dx\u2032 ,\n(36)\n\u03c6(x) =\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\f9\n\nDipole diffusion in a random electrical potential\n\nwhere K is a kernel function and \u03b7(x) is a Gaussian white noise. The linear form of (36), ensures\nthat \u03c6(x) is a Gaussian process and the translationary invariance of the kernel K(x \u2212 x\u2032 ) ensures\nR +\u221e\nits stationarity. Now taking the Fourier transform defined by \u03c6\u0303(\u03c9) = \u2212\u221e \u03c6(x) exp(\u2212i\u03c9x), dx of\n(36), we find\n\u03c6\u0303(\u03c9) = K\u0303(\u03c9)\u03b7\u0303(\u03c9).\n\n(37)\n\u2032\n\nIf we now take the Fourier transform of the correlator (3) and the correlator h\u03c6(\u03c9)\u03c6(\u03c9 )i from (37),\n \u0303\nthen by identification, we have \u2206(\u03c9)\n= |K\u0303(\u03c9)|2 and thus from (37)\nq\n \u0303\n(38)\n\u03c6\u0303(\u03c9) = \u2206(\u03c9)\u03b7\u0303(\u03c9)\n\nWe can now create \u03c6(x) by sampling \u03c6\u0303(\u03c9) on a frequency mesh and taking the inverse fast Fourier\ntransform (FFT). In [10, 12], the authors used a method due to Kraichnan [1, 28] which gives\nsome finite size corrections for the diffusion constant close to the transition. However as we\nwish to precisely locate the transition and tests its dependence on \u03bap (and as we do not have\nanalytical results for all parameter ranges) we use this FFT based method. Again we take a\ncorrelator of the form \u2206(x) = exp(\u2212 21 x2 ) and we average our sample over 2000 realizations of\nthe field. In all our simulation we set \u03c7 = 1. We measured the average value of \u03bae over the\nfield with an error bar estimated from the standard deviation from sample to sample. The result\nin one dimension is compared in figure (1) for \u03bap = 10 with the analytical result (33) and the\nKubo formula (26). As expected, we are well in the adiabatic regime and (33) is in a very good\nagreement with the numerical simulations. Moreover, we find a dynamical transition at \u03b2c = 1\nwhere the diffusion constant becomes zero and below the critical temperature Tc , the diffusion\nturns out to be anomalous (see later). Finally, the agreement between (33) and the numerical\nresults breaks down at high temperature, but fortunately in this regime the results agree with the\nweak disorder/high temperature analytical expression (26). We have thus a crossover between two\nanalytical approximation which allows us to predict the behavior of \u03bae in the whole normal diffusion\nregime.\n\nBeyond the adiabatic approximation, that is to say when \u03bap is of the same order of \u03bax or smaller,\nwe lack analytical results (except for weak disorder), thus we must calculate \u03bae numerically. The\nresults are plotted in figure (2) for \u03bap = 1 and figure (3) for \u03bap = 0.1 and compared with the weak\ndisorder result of equation (26). In both cases, the transition still appears to occur at, or very\nclose to, the same critical temperature Tc = 1. Moreover, the diffusion constant clearly decreases\nmonotonically with the value of \u03bap at fixed temperature. The low temperature phase, below Tc , is\ncharacterized by an anomalous sub-diffusive behavior\nh(x(t) \u2212 x(0))2 i \u223c Ct2\u03bd ,\n\n(39)\n\nwhere the exponent associated with the anomalous diffusion \u03bd < 1/2. The subject of anomalous\ndiffusion in disordered media has been extensively studied and a good review of it can be found in\n[9]. In the case of \u03bap \u2192 \u221e the authors in [10] were able to evaluate \u03bd by means of first passage\ncalculation and replica trick and they found\n\u03bd=\n\n1\n.\n1+\u03b2\n\n(40)\n\n\f10\n\nDipole diffusion in a random electrical potential\n1\n0.8\n\n\u03bae\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\nPSfrag replacements\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b2\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFigure 1.

Conclusions and discussion\nWe have studied the dynamics of a dipole diffusing in a random electrical field E derived from\na quenched Gaussian potential. In the adiabatic limit (where the dipoles adapt very quickly to\nthe local field), we showed that the coupled stochastic equation can be reduced, up to the order\nO(\u03bax /\u03bap ), to an effective Langevin equation for a particle diffusing in an effective potential with a\nspatially varying and anisotropic local diffusivity \u03baij . In one dimension, we could compute exactly\nthe diffusion constant of this process and we found a dynamical transition at finite temperature\n\u03b2c = 1 with a crossover between a diffusive and a sub-diffusive regime. The validity of the effective\nLangevin equation (14) breaks down for small \u03b2, but a high temperature treatment allowed us to\n\n\fDipole diffusion in a random electrical potential\n\n12\n\ncompute a Kubo formula of \u03bae for a given value of \u03bap . We numerically checked our analytical\npredictions in one dimension finding good agreement and confirming the presence of the transition.\nWe also ran simulations far from the adiabatic regime and we found strong indications that the\ntransition remains at, or close to, the same \u03b2c as for the adiabatic limit. Finally, we performed\nextensive numerical simulations in the low temperature phase to compute the anomalous exponent\n\u03bd. We found that it does not depend on the relative values of diffusion constants of the particle's\nposition and dipole moment and agrees rather well with a calculation made for the adiabatic case\n[10].\nIn [12], the authors showed that in higher dimensions, for the adiabatic case case \u03bap \u2192 \u221e, that the\nsame type of dynamical transition is also present. It would be interesting to investigate the dipole\nproblem in higher dimensions to see if the conclusions of our current study remain valid. It would\nalso be interesting to see if renormalization group type treatments or other approximation schemes\ncould be developed in order to obtain analytical results in higher dimensions.\nAppendix A.

This\nthus yields\n\u03b4xi (t)\n|s=t = Bij .\n\u03b4\u03bej (s)\n\n(A.14)\n\n\fDipole diffusion in a random electrical potential\n\n14\n\nUsing this result we obtain\n\u221a\n\u03b4xj (t)\n|s=t = 2\u03bax \u03b4ij ,\n\u03b4\u03b7xi (s)\n\n(A.15)\n\nwhich upon substitution in equation (A.9) gives\nT 1 = \u03bax h\n\n\u22022\nf (xt )i.\n\u2202xi \u2202xi\n\n(A.16)\n\nThis is the familiar Laplacian form arising for standard white noise. The second term T2 is given\nby\nr\n\u221a\n\u03bax \u2202Ej \u2202f\nT2 = 2\u03bax \u03c7\nh\n\u03b6j (t)i.\n(A.17)\n\u03bap \u2202xi \u2202xi\nOnce again using Novikov's theorem we find\n\u0012\n\u0013Z t\nr\n\u221a\n\u2202Ej \u2202f\n\u03b4xk (t)\n\u03bax \u2202\nT2 = 2\u03bax \u03c7\nh\nh\u03b6j (t)\u03b6l (s)i.\nds\n\u03bap \u2202xk \u2202xi \u2202xi\n\u03b4\u03b6l (s)\n0\n\n(A.18)\n\nThe correlation function of the Gaussian field \u03b6 is easily computed and is given for t > s by,\nZ s\n2\nh\u03b6i (t)\u03b6j (s)i = \u03b1\ndu exp (\u2212\u03b1(t + s \u2212 2u)) ,\n(A.19)\n0\n\nwhere \u03b1 = \u03bap \u03b2/\u03c7. At large t and s this becomes\n\u03b1\u03b4ij\nexp(\u2212\u03b1(t \u2212 s)).\n(A.20)\n2\nWe now consider the action of this correlation function as an operator on an arbitrary function g(s)\nvia the following operator expansion\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ t\n1 d\n1\n1\ng(t) \u2212\n(A.21)\ng(t) + O( 2 )\nds exp (\u2212\u03b1s)) g(t \u2212 s) =\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 dt\n\u03b1\n0\nh\u03b6i (t)\u03b6j (s)i =\n\nand to leading order in 1/\u03b1 we thus obtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\nr\n\u221a\n\u2202Ej \u2202f \u03b4xk (t)\n\u03bax \u2202\nh\n|t=s i.\nT2 = 2\u03bax \u03c7\n\u03bap \u2202xk \u2202xi \u2202xi \u03b4\u03b6j (s)\nNow repeating the argument leading to equation (A.15) we find that\ns\n\u2202Ej\n\u03b4xk (t)\n2\n\u03c7\u03bax\n|t=s =\n\u03b4\u03b6j (s)\n\u03bap\n\u2202xk\n\n(A.22)\n\n(A.23)\n\nand thus\nT 2 = \u03bax \u03c7\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bax\n\u03bap\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2202Ej \u2202\nh\n\u2202xk \u2202xk\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u2202Ej \u2202f\ni.\n\u2202xi \u2202xi\n\n(A.24)\n\nOne thus sees that the noise \u03b6 is to leading order white noise interpreted via the Stratonovich\nprescription. The final term to evaluate is\nZ\n\u2202f (x(t)) \u2202Ej (x(t)) t\n2\nT 3 = \u03b2 \u03bax \u03bap h\nds exp(\u2212\u03b1(t \u2212 s))Ej (x(s))i\n(A.25)\n\u2202xi\n\u2202xi\n0\n\n\fDipole diffusion in a random electrical potential\nand so one needs to compute terms of the form\nZ t\nI = hA(x(t))\nds exp(\u2212\u03b1(t \u2212 s))B(x(s))i,\n\n15\n\n(A.26)\n\n0\n\nbearing in mind that \u03b1 is large. Now if \u03c1(x, t) is the probability density for the position x and H\nthe effective forward Fokker Planck operator, we may write the above as\nZ\nI = dxB(x)\u03c1(x, s) exp(\u2212(t \u2212 s)(\u03b1 \u2212 H \u2020 ))A(x).\n(A.27)\nThe density \u03c1 obeys the Fokker Planck equation\n\n\u2202\u03c1\n= H\u03c1.\n\u2202t\nThe integration over s can be evaluated by integrating by parts, we have\nZ\n\u2212\n\nt\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds \u03c1(x, s) exp(\u2212(t \u2212 s)(\u03b1 \u2212 H \u2020 )) = \u03c1(x, t) 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212t(\u03b1 \u2212 H \u2020 )) (\u03b1 \u2212 H \u2020 )\u22121\n\nZ0 \u221e\n0\n\n(A.28)\n\nds\n\n\u2202\u03c1(x, s)\nexp(\u2212(t \u2212 s)(\u03b1 \u2212 H \u2020 ))(\u03b1 \u2212 H \u2020 )\u22121 .\n\u2202s\n\n(A.29)\n\nNow because the eigenvalues of H must be negative or zero, we may neglect the second term in the\nsquare brackets on the right hand side above. Another integration by parts yields\nZ t\nds \u03c1(x, s) exp(\u2212(t\u2212s)(\u03b1\u2212H \u2020 )) = \u03c1(x, t)(\u03b1\u2212H \u2020 )\u22121 \u2212[H\u03c1(x, t)] (\u03b1\u2212H \u2020 )\u22122 , (A.30)\n0\n\nwhere we have used equation (A.28) in the second term of the right hand side and the operator H\nin this term only acts on \u03c1 inside the square bracket. All other operators act on the right and we\ncan now expand in powers of 1/\u03b1 to obtain\nZ\n\nt\n\nds B(x)\u03c1(x, s) exp(\u2212(t \u2212 s)(\u03b1 \u2212 H \u2020 ))A(x) =\n0\n\u0015\n\u0014\nH\u2020\nH\u2020\nA(x)B(x)\n+ B(x) 2 A(x) \u2212 2 A(x)B(x) .\n\u03c1(x, t)\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\n(A.31)\n\nNow putting all this together yields\n\u22022\nhH \u2020 f (x)i = \u03bax h\nf (xt )i\n\u2202x \u2202x\n\u0012 i \u0013i\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bax\n\u2202Ej \u2202\n\u2202Ej \u2202f\n+ \u03bax\n\u03c72 h\ni\n\u03bap\n\u2202xk \u2202xk \u2202xi \u2202xi\n\u03c7\n\u03c7\n\u2202f \u2202Ej\n\u2202f \u2202Ej\n\u2202f \u2202Ej\nEj +\n\u2212\nEj i.
