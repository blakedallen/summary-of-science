Though still unable to provide a gravity dual for\nQCD proper, some of the signature features of QCD have been incorporated into semirealistic models. An important improvement was made within the model by Sakai and Sugimoto\n[3,4], who implemented a geometrical mechanism for chiral symmetry breaking into Witten's\nmodel [5]. The construction is based on the following strategy. The starting point is the near\nhorizon limit of a geometry generated by a large number Nc of color D-branes. To include\nfundamental quarks into the dual gauge theory one has to add a stack of Nf flavor D-branes\nto this background. Strings stretching between the color and flavor branes naturally transform in the fundamental representation U(Nc ) \u00d7 U(Nf ). In case Nf \u226a Nc , the backreaction\nof the flavor branes on the background can be safely neglected, i.e., one works in the probe\nbrane approximation [6]. This corresponds to the so-called quenched approximation of (large\nNc massless) lattice QCD, in which the backreaction of the flavors on the colors is neglected\ncompletely while the color dynamics and its effect on the flavors are accounted for.\nIn order to have a geometric mechanism for chiral symmetry breaking one needs to add\nanother stack of Nf anti-D-branes associated in the dual gauge theory to anti-quarks in the\nfundamental representation of U(Nf ). This has to be accomplished in such a way that in the\nUV the two stacks are separated from each other, resulting in the dual gauge theory enjoying\nthe full UL (Nf ) \u00d7 UR (Nf ) flavor symmetry. In the IR however, if the two stacks of branes\nand anti-branes merge smoothly into a single stack, only a diagonal subgroup UD (Nf ) of the\nfull flavor group survives and chiral symmetry is broken.\nIn the Sakai-Sugimoto model, this was beautifully realized by introducing Nf D8- and D8branes into the near extremal geometry generated by a stack of Nc D4-branes in type IIA\nsuperstring theory. In order to obtain a 3 + 1 dimensional gauge theory in the IR, the x4 direction is compactified on a circle. The two-dimensional submanifold of the background in\nthe (x4 , r)-directions turns out to be cigar-shaped, leading to a U-shaped profile of the trajectories of the D8-D8-branes in these directions, thus constituting a geometric realization\nof chiral symmetry breaking as described above.\nThe Sakai-Sugimoto model has been applied to a large number of different aspects in hadronic\nphysics. For a review of mesons in this and other holographic models, see [7] and references\ntherein. Form factors of vector and axial-vector mesons and pions in the Sakai-Sugimoto\nand other holographic models have been obtained in, e.g., [8,9,10,11].\nAlthough the Sakai-Sugimoto model was the first example of a stable geometric model of\nchiral symmetry breaking with completely broken supersymmetry, it suffers from shortcomings inherited from Witten's original model. Most notably, the model is only well-defined\nas a 3 + 1-dimensional field theory in the IR. As one goes to higher energies, KK modes\nbecome important at masses of the order of the inverse radius of the S 1 . At even higher\nenergies, the dilaton (or string coupling) starts to blow up and one has to S-dualize. The UV\ncompletion of the theory is in fact the six-dimensional ANc \u22121 (2, 0) superconformal theory\n[12,13]. To overcome some of these problems, Kuperstein and Sonnenschein [14] managed\nto incorporate stacks of flavor D7- and D7-branes into a background with constant dilaton,\n2\n\n\fnamely the Klebanov-Witten model [15], which is based on the singular conifold geometry.\nThis embedding was engineered such that it breaks the remaining supersymmetry of the\nbackground completely and the two branches join smoothly in the IR.1\nIn this paper we will focus on studying phenomenological aspects of the KS model [14], such\nas the spectrum of vector and axial-vector mesons, their mutual couplings and couplings to\nthe pion as well as form factors of pions and (axial-) vector mesons. Our analysis indicates\nthat vector meson dominance is realized in the KS model which means that the electromagnetic interaction of hadrons is mediated exclusively by vector mesons. The mass spectrum\nof (axial-) vector mesons was first obtained in [14], and our findings agree with the mass\nspectrum presented in that article. Many of the results presented below are quite similar to\nthe results in the Sakai-Sugimoto D4 \u2212 D8 brane model [3,4,8]. This is due to the similar\nshape of the D7-brane embedding. For the pion form factor, our results in fact reproduce\nthe experimental data slightly better than the Sakai-Sugimoto model, as we will demonstrate below. Besides obvious numerical differences, one crucial difference is that, in the KS\nmodel, instead of a Kaluza-Klein mass scale MKK , there is a mass scale M\u2217 depending on\nthe parameter r0 , the minimal distance of the D7-branes to the singularity at r = 0, which\nalso parametrizes a one-parameter family of solutions to the classical equations of motion of\nthe D7-brane embedding.\nThe paper is organized as follows:\nIn section 2, we give a brief review of the Kuperstein-Sonnenschein model, followed by a\ndiscussion of vector and axial-vector mesons in section 3. Section 4 contains a discussion of\nthe pions and vector meson dominance. In section 5, we present our results for the various\nform factors. We formulate our conclusions in section 6.\n\n2.\n\nReview of the Kuperstein-Sonnenschein model\n\n2.1.\n\nD3-brane background\n\nThe KS model is based on the D3-brane background with a conical singularity in type\nIIB superstring theory first studied by Klebanov and Witten [15]. This is an extension\nof the original AdS/CFT correspondence by studying strings on AdS5 \u00d7 X 5 , where X 5 no\nlonger is the 5-sphere but a five-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein space, namely the coset space\nT 1,1 = (SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2))/U(1) with Einstein metric\n!2\n2\n2\nX\n1X 2\n1\n2\nd\u03c8 +\ncos \u03b8i d\u03c6i +\n(d\u03b8i + sin2 \u03b8i d\u03c62i ).\n(2.1)\ndsT 1,1 =\n9\n6\ni=1\ni=1\n\nBefore taking the near-horizon limit, the six dimensional internal space transverse to the\nD3-branes is a Calabi-Yau manifold Y6 with a singularity, called a conifold, which is a cone\nover the base manifold T 1,1 (topologically, T 1,1 is S 2 \u00d7 S 3 ). Namely,\nds2(10)\n\nr2\nR2 2\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n= 2 \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx dx + 2 ds(6) ,\nR\nr\n\n1\n\n(2.2)\n\nA lot of work has been done studying supersymmetric embeddings into the Klebanov-Witten and\nKlebanov-Strassler models (e.g., [16,17,18]). However, it turns out that these embeddings only allow a\nsingle branch of branes and thus they are not useful as models of chiral symmetry beaking.\n\n3\n\n\fwhere\n\n\u0001\nds2(6) = dr 2 + r 2 ds2T 1,1 ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nand the AdS5 radius is R4 = 27\n\u03c0gs Nc ls4 .\n4\nThe field theory dual resulting from a stack of Nc D3-branes placed at the conifold singularity\nis a N = 1 superconformal field theory with gauge group SU(Nc ) \u00d7 SU(Nc ) and global\nsymmetry (SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2)) \u00d7 U(1). It contains four chiral superfields, Ai , i = 1, 2, a doublet\nof the first SU(2) factor transforming as (Nc , Nc ) and Bj , j = 1, 2, a doublet of the second\nSU(2) factor transforming as (Nc , Nc ). The theory has a marginal superpotential W =\n\u01ebil \u01ebjm Ai Bj Al Bm , and the R-charge of all chiral superfields is 21 .\n2.2.\n\nD7-brane profiles\n\nOne of the achievements of [14] was to study a D7-brane configuration spanning the spacetime coordinates x\u03bc , the radial coordinate r and the S 3 parametrized by the one-forms fi .\nThe one-forms fi , i = 1, 2, 3 are defined as (for details, cf. [33,34,35,36]),\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8eb \u2032 \uf8f6\nf1\n0 cos \u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03b8\n\u2212 sin \u03c6 \u2212 cos \u03c6 0\nw1\n\uf8ed f2 \uf8f8 = \uf8ed 1\n\uf8f8 \uf8ed \u2212 cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 0 \uf8f8 \uf8ed w2\u2032 \uf8f8\n0\n0\n(2.4)\n\u2032\nw3\nf3\n0 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\n0\n0\n1\n\nwhere the SU(2) left-invariant Maurer-Cartan forms wi\u2032 , i = 1, 2, 3 are determined by the\nfollowing condition:\n3\niX\n\u2020\nX dX =\n\u03c3i wi\u2032 .\n(2.5)\n2 i=1\n\nThe explicit form of the one-forms wi\u2032 and the definition of the matrix X can be found, e.g.,\nin [36]. It should be noted that the structure involving the SO(3) matrices determines the\nfibration of the S 3 over the S 2 . This leaves two transversal coordinates, namely those on the\nS 2 , \u03b8 and \u03c6. We will assume that \u03b8 and \u03c6 do not depend on the S 3 coordinates (note that\nour ansatz preserves one of the SU(2) factors of the global conifold symmetry). This can\nbe justified by expanding the action around the solution and verifying that contributions\nfrom non-trivial S 3 modes only appear at second order in the fluctuations. Therefore the\nclassical solution will only depend on the radial coordinate, \u03b8 = \u03b8(r), \u03c6 = \u03c6(r). Plugging\nthis ansatz into the DBI action for D7-branes yields the following Lagrangian (for details,\nsee the discussion in [14]):\n\"\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u00132 #!\n2\nr2\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03c6\n3\n2\nL\u221dr 1+\n.\n(2.6)\n+ sin \u03b8\n6\n\u2202r\n\u2202r\nWe can use the SU(2) invariance of the Lagrangian to set \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, i.e., restrict the motion\nto the equator of the S 2 . Then the solution of the field equations is given by\n\u0013 \u0010 \u0011\n\u0012\nr0 4\n4\n.\n(2.7)\ncos \u221a \u03c6(r) =\nr\n6\n4\n\n\fThe trajectory \u03c6(r) has two branches, namely \u03c6 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0/2, 0] and\n\u03c6 \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2]. In the extremal\n\u221a\n6\ncase r0 = 0, there are two r-independent solutions, \u03c6\u00b1 = \u00b1 8 \u03c0. For r0 6= 0, the solution\n\u03c6(r) starts at \u03c6(r = r0 ) = 0 and approaches the asymptotic values \u03c6\u00b1 as r \u2192 \u221e.\nIn conclusion, [14] found a one-parameter family of solutions parametrized by r0 sharing the\nsame boundary values \u03c6\u00b1 . For r0 > 0 the conformal symmetry of the underlying KlebanovWitten background is broken, since there is no AdS5 factor in the induced metric. It is\nworth noting, however, that in the limit r \u2192 \u221e, one recovers the AdS5 metric and conformal\ninvariance is restored.

According to the gauge/gravity correpondence, mesons of the dual gauge theory arise as modes\nof open strings stretching between the D7- and D7-branes. In particular, vector and axialvector mesons correspond to fluctuations of the U(Nf ) gauge fields living on the D7-branes.\nTo first order, these fluctuations are captured by the action\nZ\np\n\u2032 2\n(3.1)\nSD7 = \u2212(\u03c0\u03b1 ) \u03bc7 d4 xdzd3 \u03a9e\u2212\u03a6 \u2212g(8) tr(FM N F M N ) + SCS ,\n\nwhere the first term is the Maxwell term of the non-abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action2 of the\nD7 branes and the second term is the Chern-Simons term, which is irrelevant for the topic at\nhand.

In what follows, we will set A\u03b1 = 0\nand assume that the other gauge field components are independent of the S 3 coordinates.\nFive-dimensional effective action.

Note that the results for the Sakai-Sugimoto model should\n2\nonly be trusted up to the KK scale MKK\n\u223c (0.946GeV)2 .

Because of\nthis the photon interacts with a meson only through intermediate vector mesons, which is a\nrealization of vector meson dominance (VMD) in electromagnetic scattering in this model.\nNumerically, the convergence of the relevant integrals is even slower than in the pion case.\nHowever, we find a vector meson dominance pattern that is very similar to the one described\nin [10] in the AdS/QCD hard wall model, where the dominant contributions to Fv1 (q 2 = 0)\nwere shown to come from the first two bound states (to 10\u22123 accuracy).

Also, for the first vector\nand axial-vector excitations, \u03c1(770) and a1 (1260), we compute the electric radius and the\nmagnetic and quadrupole moments.

The deviation from the q \u22124 dependence is\nrelated to the non-vanishing of the numerical sums (5.25).\nElectric, magnetic and quadrupole form factors.

In the following, we will\nestimate three important physical quantities from these form factors which are associated\nwith the vector mesons: the electric radius, the magnetic and quadrupole moments.\nElectric radius.

Owing to the fact that Fvn and Fan go to one\nas q 2 \u2192 0, the magnetic and quadrupole moments in the KS model formally reproduce the\nresults obtained in other holographic models, e.g., the Sakai-Sugimoto model [8] or the hard\nwall model [10]:\n\u03bc := FM (q 2 )|q2 =0 ,\n1\nD := \u2212 2 FQ (q 2 )|q2 =0 ,\np\n\n\u21d2 \u03bcvn /an = 2\n\n(5.34)\n\n\u21d2 Dv m = \u2212\n\n(5.35)\n\n1\n1\n, Dam = \u2212 2 .\n2\nMvm\nMam\n\nOf course, the numerical values of these quantities in the KS model differ slightly from\nother holographic models, since the masses Mvn and Man differ from model to model.\nDecomposition in terms of transverse and longitudinal polarizations. It is instructive to study the form factors of vector mesons with specific polarizations. The definition of the transverse and longitudinal polarizations and the corresponding form factors can be found in, e.g., [29,8]. The large q 2 behavior of these form factors in the KS\nmodel is determined from Fvm , eq. (5.23). We obtain the following asymptotic behaviors:\n(vm )\n(vm )\n(vm )\nFT T \u223c q \u22124 , FLT \u223c q \u22123 , FLL \u223c q \u22122 , in agreement with the D4-D8 model [8] and QCD\ncalculations (see, e.g., [29]).\n21\n\n\fNon-elastic case. Finally, we consider the form factors for the case that the initial and final\nmeson states are different. These are called generalized, transition or non-elastic form factors. The interaction with the photon is determined by the eqs. (5.15), (5.21), with m 6= l.\nWe calculate these form factors explicitly for the initial vector meson state v (1) and final\nstates v (m) with m = 2, 3, 4 and the same for axial-vector mesons.\nThe results are plotted in figure 8, compared with the corresponding elastic form factors.\nHere, q 2 denotes the momentum transfer.\nFv1viHq2 L\n0.12\n\nFa1ai Hq2 L\n0.14\n\n0.10\n\n0.12\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n0.08\n\n0.06\n\n0.06\n0.04\n0.04\n0.02\n\n0.02\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n2\n\nq HGeV L\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nq2 HGeV2 L\n\nFigure 8: Transition form factors for vector mesons Fv1 vi (left graphs) and axial-vector\nmesons Fa1 ai (right graphs), for i = 1 (elastic case, solid line), i = 2 (dashed line), i = 3\n(dot-dashed line) and i = 4 (dotted line).\n\nq4  \u0301Fv1viHq2 L\n12\n\nq4  \u0301Fa1ai Hq2 L\n35\n30\n\n10\n\n25\n\n8\n\n20\n6\n15\n4\n\n10\n\n2\n\n5\n2\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n2\n\nq HGeV L\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\nq2 HGeV2 L\n\nFigure 9: q 4 times the transition form factors for vector mesons Fv1 vi (left graphs) and axialvector mesons Fa1 ai (right graphs), for i = 1 (elastic case, solid line), i = 2 (dashed line),\ni = 3 (dot-dashed line).\nObserve that, as q 2 \u2192 0, the non-elastic form factors go to zero, while the elastic form factors\napproach one in this limit. As we increase q 2 , the form factors decrease at different rates. At\nsmall q 2 , Fv1 dominates, then Fv1 v2 takes over, then Fv1 v3 , and so forth. The same situation\noccurs for the axial-vector case. Physically, this can be explained by the fact that, as the\nmomentum transfer increases, the amplitude for producing heavier final states increases as\nwell.\n\n22\n\n\fRegarding the large q 2 dependence of these non-elastic form factors, we can make an expansion similar to eq.

We conclude that the transition form factors asymptotically approach the\nexpected q \u22124 dependence, within the numerical errors.\n\n6.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we studied the spectrum of vector and axial-vector mesons, along with the\npion and meson form factors, in the holographic model of chiral symmetry breaking of\nKuperstein and Sonnenschein. Moreover, we found that vector meson dominance is a feature\nof electromagnetic interactions of mesons in the KS model. We compared our numerical\nresults to the Sakai-Sugimoto model as well as expectations from QCD. Our results for\nthe form factors are generally in good qualitative agreement with QCD results. The pion\nform factor obtained in our model agrees well even quantitatively with the data provided\nby the Jefferson Lab Fpi2 collaboration. This agreement is somewhat surprising, since our\nmodel is not dual to (large Nc ) QCD, but rather a quiver gauge theory with gauge group\nSU(Nc ) \u00d7 SU(Nc ). The meson physics is governed by open string excitations on the D7\nflavor branes and depends on the details of the D7-brane embedding. This embedding\nis in many ways similar to the embedding of flavor branes in the Sakai-Sugimoto model.\nHowever, the asymptotic behavior of the geometries is quite different. The asymptotic\nconformal invariance of the Kuperstein-Sonnenschein model may explain why our results at\nlarge q 2 are close to QCD. Another notable difference between the Sakai-Sugimoto model\nand the KS model, concerning numerics, is that, in many cases, convergence of certain\nintegrals and summations is much slower and harder to achieve numerically, due to the slow\nfall-off of the KS wave functions for large z\u0303. Nevertheless, our results, especially for the\n23\n\n\fpion form factor, clearly demonstrate the viability and phenomenological potential of the\nKuperstein-Sonnenschein model. It would be very interesting to improve our understanding\nof the differences between the D-brane embeddings with respect to QCD phenomenology.\nFor example, one could try to classify possible D-brane geometries and the resulting fivedimensional effective actions and investigate their usefulness for phenomenological questions.\nWe leave this question to future research.\nIn a more recent paper, Dymarsky, Kuperstein and Sonnenschein (DKS) [30] study a similar,\nyet more complicated, model of chiral symmetry breaking. This model is based on the\nKlebanov-Strassler background [31] which can be considered a non-conformal generalization\nof the Klebanov-Witten background. It features confinement at low energies and flows (via\na Seiberg duality cascade) to a theory close to N = 1 super Yang-Mills in the IR. With the\naddition of fundamental flavor degrees of freedom this becomes a QCD-like theory. We are\npresently investigating its phenomenology which we will report in a follow-up paper [32].\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are partially supported by CAPES and CNPq (Brazilian research agencies).\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
