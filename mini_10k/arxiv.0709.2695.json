Here prime stands\nfor differentiation over x and \u03b6(t) is a commonly assumed\nwhite Gaussian noise representing close-to-equilibrium\nfluctuations of the dynamic variable x. In contrast, in farfrom-equilibrium situations, the Gaussianity of the noise\nterm may be questionable, due to e.g. strong interaction\nwith the surrounding \"bath\" [4, 5]. A natural generalizations to the Brownian motion are then \u03b4-correlated L\u00e9vy\nstable processes which can be interpreted as fluctuations\nresulting from strong collisions between the test particle and the environment. In particular, the scale-free,\nself similar feature of L\u00e9vy distributions gives rise to the\noccurrences of large increments of the position coordinates \u2206x during small time intervals causing a non-local\ncharacter of the motion. Within the paper we address\nthe problem of kinetics as described by Eq. (1) under\nthe action of \u03b6(t) representing a stationary white L\u00e9vy\nnoise [6, 7]. Accordingly, the position of the Brownian\nparticle subjected to additive white L\u00e9vy noise is calculated by direct integration of Eq. (1) with respect to\nthe \u03b1-stable measure [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] L\u03b1,\u03b2 (s), i.e.,\nx(t + \u2206t) = x(t) \u2212 V \u2032 (x(t))\u2206t + (\u2206t)1/\u03b1 \u03b6, where \u03b6 is distributed according to the \u03b1-stable L\u00e9vy type distribution\nL\u03b1,\u03b2 (\u03b6; \u03c3, \u03bc = 0) whose representation [6, 8, 12] is given\nby the characteristic function \u03c6(k)R defined in the Fourier\n\u221e\nspace \u03c6(k) = F (L\u03b1,\u03b2 (\u03b6; \u03c3, \u03bc)) = \u2212\u221e d\u03b6eik\u03b6 L\u03b1,\u03b2 (\u03b6; \u03c3, \u03bc)\nfor \u03b1 6= 1\ni\n\u0010\nh\n\u03c0\u03b1 \u0011\n+ i\u03bck ,\n\u03c6(k) = exp \u2212\u03c3 \u03b1 |k|\u03b1 1 \u2212 i\u03b2sgn(k) tan\n2\n(2)\nand for \u03b1 = 1\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n2\n\u03c6(k) = exp \u2212\u03c3|k| 1 + i\u03b2 sgn(k) ln |k| + i\u03bck . (3)\n\u03c0\n\nThe stability index \u03b1, determining tails of the probability\ndensity function (PDF) takes values \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 2], the skewness of the distribution is modeled by the asymmetry parameter \u03b2 \u2208 [\u22121, 1]. Indices \u03b1 and \u03b2 classify the type of\nstable distributions up to translations and dilations [6, 8].\nTwo other parameters of scaling \u03c3 \u2208 (0, \u221e) and location\n\u03bc \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) can vary, although replacing \u03b6 \u2212 \u03bc and \u03c3\u03b6\nin the original coordinates, shifts the origin and rescales\nthe abscissa without altering function L\u03b1,\u03b2 (\u03b6). For simplicity, we will restrict here to strictly stable L\u00e9vy noises\nwith \u03bc = 0 [6, 8]. Generally, for \u03b2 = \u03bc = 0 PDFs are\nsymmetric while for \u03b2 = \u00b11 and \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) they are totally skewed, i.e., \u03b6 is always positive or negative only,\ndepending on the sign of asymmetry parameter \u03b2 (cf.\nFig. 2). Asymptotically, for \u03b6 \u2192 \u221e with \u03b1 < 2, stable\nPDFs behave as p(\u03b6) \u221d |\u03b6|\u2212(\u03b1+1) causing divergence of\nmoments h\u03b6 \u03bd i = \u221e for \u03bd > \u03b1.

In the\napproach presented herein, instead of solving Eq. (4), information on the system is drawn from the statistics of\nnumerically [6, 8, 20] generated trajectories satisfying the\ngeneralized Langevin equation (1).

The time independent potential V (x) is assumed\nto be of the form V (x) = x4 /4 which guarantees the confinement of the trajectory x(t) within the potential well\n[21, 23, 24] leading to a finite variance of the stationary\nPDF.

To check\nwhether results are influenced by the length of simulations, results for various Tmax (Tmax = 10, Tmax = 15)\nwere compared showing consistency of estimated PDFs\nfor both values. Further details on values of parameters are included in the text underlying the figures. Numerical examination of Eq. (1) allows for construction of\nPDF estimators for the whole range of parameters \u03b1 and\n\u03b2. Likewise, by direct integration of Eq. (1) it is also\npossible to investigate time- dependent PDFs [20] and\nnoise-induced bimodality of the probability distribution\n[20, 21, 23, 24].\nThe change of \u03b1 (for \u03b2 6= 0) from values greater than 1\nto values smaller than 1 results in change of location of a\nmodal value of stable densities, see left vs. right panel of\nFig. 2. The shift of modal values is reflected in properties\nof stationary states. For \u03b1 > 1 with \u03b2 < 0 the modal\nvalue is located for x > 0 (right panel of Fig. 3) while\nfor \u03b1 < 1 with \u03b2 < 0 it shifts to the negative interval\nx < 0 (left panel of Fig. 3). For \u03b2 < 0 modal values are\nlocated on the opposite side of the origin than for \u03b2 > 0.\n\n\u03b2 = -1.0\n\u03b2 = 0.0\n\u03b2 = 1.0\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n-20\n\n\u03b2 = -1.0\n\u03b2 = 0.0\n\u03b2 = 1.0\n\n0.4\n\nL1.1, \u03b2 (x, \u03c3=1, \u03bc=0)\n\n0.4\n\nL0.9, \u03b2 (x, \u03c3=1, \u03bc=0)\n\nwhere P\u0302 (k) stands for a Fourier transform of the stationary PDF, P (x) = limt\u2192\u221e P (x, t). Analytical solutions\nof Eq.

For \u03b2 = 0 distributions are symmetric\nand become asymmetric for \u03b2 = \u00b11. The support of the\ndensities for the fully asymmetric cases with \u03b2 = \u00b11 and\n\u03b1 < 1 (left panel) assumes only negative values for \u03b2 = \u22121\nand only positive values for \u03b2 = 1. Note the differences in the\npositions of the maxima for \u03b1 < 1 and \u03b1 > 1.\n\nTherefore, the position of the modal value can be moved\nfrom the positive to negative real lines by change of \u03b1\nwhile \u03b2 is kept constant (left vs. right panel of Fig. 3)\nor by change of \u03b2 to \u2212\u03b2 with a preset value of \u03b1 (cf.\ndifferent rows in Fig. 3).\nThe fact that changes in \u03b2 can change the location of\nthe modal value suggests that periodic changes in this parameter can lead to a phenomenon resembling dynamical\nhysteresis [27, 28, 29]. In order to register a hysteretic\nbehavior of the system, we have performed an analysis of\ntrajectories of Eq. (1) based on a two-state approximation.

In\nthe Fig. 4 values of p(left) for various T\u03a9 (with \u03b2max = 1)\nare presented. Stable random variables for \u03b1 < 1 with\n|\u03b2| = 1 take only positive/negative values, depending on\nthe sign of \u03b2. Therefore higher level of saturation is observed for \u03b1 = 0.9 (left panel) than for \u03b1 = 1.1 (right\npanel), i.e., when |\u03b2| = 1 probability of being in the\nleft/right state for \u03b1 = 0.9 is higher than for \u03b1 = 1.1\n(right panel). The direction of the hysteresis loop is a\ndirect consequence of the fact that changes in \u03b2 move\nmodal values from positive/negative real line to the negative/positive real line. Due to the initial condition imposed on x(0), the starting point for each hysteresis loop\nis (0,0.5) and the first part of the curve describes approaching to the proper hysteresis loop. With decreasing \u03a9 (increasing T\u03a9 ) area of hysteresis loop decreases\nbecause the system has more time for relaxation and response to the changes of \u03b2. For large \u03a9 (small T\u03a9 ) the\nresponse of the system is more delayed and consequently\narea of the hysteresis loop is larger.\nFinally the influence of \u03b2max on the shape of hysteresis loop has been examined. In Fig. 5 hysteresis loops\nfor various \u03b2max (with T\u03a9 = 9) are presented.

(1). In\nparticular skewed noise characterized by nonzero asymmetry parameter \u03b2 can induce asymmetry of stationary states in symmetric potentials. Furthermore, totally\nskewed stable noises (\u03b1 < 1 with |\u03b2| = 1) could move\n\n\f4\nthe probability mass to one side of the x-axis making\nstationary states totally skewed. In such situations, the\nwhole probability mass can be located on the left hand\nside or on the right hand side of the origin x = 0 depending on the sign of the asymmetry parameter \u03b2. For\n\u03b1 > 1 with a nonzero \u03b2, stable noises still are asymmetric. Nevertheless, even |\u03b2| = 1 is not sufficient to induce\ntotally skewed stationary states. Consequently, dynamical hysteresis loops induced by cyclic variation of \u03b2 for\n\u03b1 < 1 and \u03b1 > 1 are characterized by various level of\nsaturation, see left vs. right panel of Fig. 4.\nThe stationary densities depicted in Fig. 3 are recorded\nin the system described by Eq. (1) which is subjected\nto the action of stable noises. The very same stationary densities can be also observed in the equilibrium system perturbed by the white Gaussian noise, i.e.,\n\u2032\n\u1e8b(t) = \u2212Veff\n(x, t) + \u03be(t), where Veff (x, t) = \u2212 log[p(x, t)]\nand h\u03be(t)\u03be(t\u2032 )i = \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ). The dynamical hysteresis detected in the model described by Eq. (1) emerges as a\nconsequence of periodical modulation of the asymmetry\nparameter \u03b2. In the effective potential model, periodical\nmodulation of the asymmetry parameter corresponds to\nthe periodical modulation [30] of the effective potential\nVeff (x). Nevertheless both models are not fully equivalent. They have the same one-point densities p(x, t),\nwhile other characteristic of the process {x(t)} are distinct [22]. Therefore, examination of stationary densities\nitself is not a fully conclusive method for discrimination\nof underlying types of noises.\nThe dynamical hysteresis can be also observed in\nthe generic double well potential model subject to the\njoint action of the deterministic periodic modulation and\nstochastic \u03b1-stable fluctuations [20]. In such a case, however, the shape of the dynamical hysteresis loop is affected both by the character of the noise and by the type\nof periodic modulation [20].\nThe research has been supported by the Marie Curie\nTOK COCOS grant (6th EU Framework Program under\nContract No. MTKD-CT-2004-517186).
