A\ntypical example is a class of spin-ice type Ising models. In this case, the difficulty can be avoided\nby introducing a global-flip algorithm, the loop algorithm. Similar difficulty is encountered\nin O(3) Heisenberg models in the presence of biquadratic interaction. The loop algorithm,\nhowever, is not straightforwardly applied to this case, since the system does not have a priori\nspin-anisotropy axis for constructing the loops. We propose an extension of the loop algorithm\nto the bilinear-biquadratic models. The efficiency is tested for three different ways to flip spins\non a loop in Monte Carlo simulation. We show that the most efficient method depends on the\nstrength of the biquadratic interaction.\n\n1. Introduction\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulation is a powerful tool for investigating thermodynamic properties of\nclassical spin models [1]. The standard single-spin flip algorithm is widely used because it is\nsimple and applicable to systems with any type of interactions. However, it is well known that it\nsuffers from slow relaxation in many cases. For example, the single-spin-flip dynamics exhibits\ncritical slowing down near a continuous transition temperature where the correlation length\ndiverges. Such difficulty is avoided by using a nonlocal, global update, such as the SwendsenWang cluster algorithm for Ising systems [2] or its Wolff's extension to Heisenberg systems [3].\nThese cluster algorithms accelerate the relaxation by flipping many spins at once, i.e., updating\nthe spin configuration drastically.\nBesides the critical slowing down, the single-spin flip algorithm often suffers from dynamical\nfreezing at low temperature (T ) when the ground state has macroscopic degeneracy under the\ninfluence of geometrical frustration. A typical example is an antiferromagnetic Ising model on\na pyrochlore lattice. The pyrochlore lattice is a three-dimensional frustrated structure given\nby a corner-sharing network of tetrahedra, as shown in Fig. 1(a). When the antiferromagnetic\nexchange interaction is limited to nearest-neighbor sites, no long-range ordering occurs down\nto zero T and the ground state has macroscopic degeneracy [4]. The degenerate manifold is\nidentified by a collection of local constraints enforcing two spins pointing up and two spins\npointing down in every tetrahedron, as exemplified in Fig. 1(a). This 'two-up two-down'\n\n\fconstraint is called the ice rule because of an analogy to the constraint on positions of protons in\nhexagonal ice [5, 6]. Similar situation was recently discovered in the so-called spin-ice systems,\nin which the Ising-like spins point along the local h111i axes and interact with each other\nby ferromagnetic exchange interaction and dipole interaction [7, 8]. Because the degenerate\n'ice-rule' configurations are separated by large energy barriers of the order of the dominant\ninteraction scale J, the single-spin flip does not work at low T \u226a J. The difficulty is avoided by\nintroducing a global flip called the loop flip, in which one reverses all Ising spins on a specific\nclosed loop passing through tetrahedra [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]; the loop is chosen so that the spins\nare up and down (inward and outward in the spin-ice problem) alternatively along the loop [see\nthe hexagon in Fig. 1(a) as an example]. This loop flip enables to transform an ice-rule state to\nanother ice-rule state bypassing the energy barriers.\nThe difficulty remains even when the Ising discreteness is relaxed and spins can fluctuate, as\nlong as the ground-state manifold retains a multivalley structure with large energy barriers. Such\nsituation is seen in variants of pyrochlore antiferromagnets, such as classical Heisenberg models\nin the presence of the single-ion easy-axis anisotropy [14, 15] and the biquadratic interaction [16].\nIn contrast to the Ising case, however, it is nontrivial how to define the loop with alternating\nspins. Moreover, the loop flip procedure is not unique in the Heisenberg spin case because of\nthe continuous degrees of freedom. Recently, the authors extended the loop algorithm to the\nHeisenberg spin systems with single-ion anisotropy by defining 'colors' of spins as black and\nwhite, which is a natural generalization of up and down in the antiferromagnetic Ising case,\nin terms of the projection of spins on the anisotropy axis [15]. We tested different ways to\nflip spins on a formed loop and showed that the efficiency strongly depends on the method.\nIn the models with the biquadratic interaction, however, because of the O(3) spin rotational\nsymmetry, we have no explicit anisotropy axis to project spins on. Therefore, an extension of\nthe loop algorithm to this class of models is not straightforward.\nIn this paper, we develop an extension of the loop algorithm to classical antiferromagnetic\nHeisenberg spin systems with biquadratic interaction in which the spin-ice type manifold emerges\nat low T . We propose a way to define the projection axis for constructing loops and test three\ndifferent ways to flip a formed loop. We apply the algorithm to a nearest-neighbor bilinearbiquadratic model, and compare the efficiency of the three methods. Interested readers are\nreferred to Ref. [17] for further application of the present algorithm to a bond-disordered bilinearbiquadratic model.\n2. Extension of the loop algorithm to bilinear-biquadratic spin systems\n2.1. Model\nIn this section, we extend the loop algorithm to classical antiferromagnetic Heisenberg models\nwith biquadratic interactions. We start with a Hamiltonian of a simple form:\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u00112 \u001b\nX\u001a \u0010\n~i * S\n~j \u2212 b S\n~i * S\n~j\nH=\nJ S\n,\n(1)\nhi,ji\n\n~i denotes a classical Heisenberg spin at site i on the pyrochlore lattice [Fig. 1(a)] (we\nwhere S\n~\ntake |Si | = 1) and b is the coupling constant of the biquadratic interaction. Here we consider\nb > 0 which favors collinear spin configurations. We note that such 'ferro'-type biquadratic\ninteraction originates in the spin-lattice coupling as well as quantum and thermal fluctuations.\nWe consider the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction J > 0, and take the energy unit as\nJ = 1. The sum runs over the nearest-neighbor bonds of the pyrochlore lattice. The following\nalgorithm is applicable to more general spin-ice type models on other frustrated lattices with\nfarther-neighbor or bond-dependent interactions, and site-dependent anisotropy.\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(2) flip parallel\n(1) flip xyz\n\n(3) rotate\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n6\n\n1\n\n3\n\n4\n6\n\n5\n\n5\n\n4\n\nFigure 1. (a) The pyrochlore lattice composed of a three-dimensional network of corner-sharing\ntetrahedra. A 16-site cubic unit cell is shown. Spins are denoted by solid arrows. The broken\n~ shows a common axis selected by b in the nematic phase. Black (filled) circles represent\narrow Q\n~ while white (open) circles represent spins in the opposite direction.\nspins in the direction of Q,\nThe spin configuration is an example of the spin-ice type states in which the 'two-up two-down'\nlocal constraint is satisfied in every tetrahedron. The hexagon with a bold dashed line denotes\none of the shortest loops on which a flip of all spins (black and white) transforms the ice-rule\nstate to another ice-rule state. (b) Three different ways to flip black and white: (1) flip xyz, (2)\nflip parallel, and (3) rotate. See the text for details.\nWhen b = 0, the model given by Eq. (1) exhibits no long-range ordering down to T = 0, and\n~i to be\nthe ground state is given by a collection of local constraints that enforces the sum of S\nzero in every tetrahedron. Consequently, the ground-state manifold has continuous macroscopic\ndegeneracy [18, 19, 20]. For b > 0, the present model exhibits a weak first-order transition\n~ without\nat Tc \u223c b to a nematic state in which spins spontaneously select a common axis Q\nselecting their directions on it [16]. Hence, the ground state for b > 0 is identified by a collection\nof spin-ice type local constraints: in every tetrahedron, two out of four spins are aligned parallel\nto each other and the other two are antiparallel to them - 'two-up two-down' configuration [see\nFig. 1(a)]. The ground-state manifold develops a multivalley structure whose minima correspond\nto different spin-ice-type configurations separated by large energy barriers of the order of b and\nJ.\n2.2. Algorithm\nIn the previous paper, the authors developed an extension of the loop algorithm to be applicable\nto a family of classical Heisenberg antiferromagnets with single-ion anisotropy, in which the\nsingle-spin flip algorithm suffers from slow relaxation due to the formation of the spin-ice type\nmanifold [15]. In the extended loop algorithm, (i) we first project all the spins onto the anisotropy\naxis to assign black and white colors, (ii) next, construct a loop of alternating black and white,\nand (iii) flip all the spins on the loop. For the present bilinear-biquadratic model, a similar\ndifficulty from slow relaxation is anticipated because the low-T state develops the spin-ice type\ndegeneracy as mentioned above. However, it is not straightforward to apply the extended loop\nalgorithm since the present model retains O(3) spin rotational symmetry and does not have any\n~\nexplicit anisotropy axis to project the spins on. It is necessary to deduce the common axis Q\nselected by b for each MC sample.\nHere, we propose the following procedure to define the projection axis. We first pick up a\nset of NT tetrahedra {Tm } (m = 1, * * * , NT ) randomly from the whole system. Starting from an\n\n\finitial guess \u03b1\n~ 0 [we take \u03b1\n~ 0 = (0, 0, 1)], the normalized projection axis \u03b1\n~ is obtained iteratively\nby\nX\n~i * \u03b1\n~i .\n\u03b1\n~ n+1 \u221d\nsign(S\n~ n )S\n(2)\ni\u2208{Tm }\n\nHere the sum is taken over all spins belonging to the selected tetrahedra {Tm }, and n (=\n0, 1, * * * , nmax \u2212 1) is the index of the iteration. For larger NT and nmax , the resultant \u03b1\n~ =\u03b1\n~ nmax\n~ In practice, we take NT = 24 and nmax = 6 in the following\ngives a better approximation of Q.\ncalculations for the system size with Ns = 16 \u00d7 83 spins. We confirm that the loop flip is\nefficiently performed for these conditions, as demonstrated below. Once \u03b1\n~ is defined in this\nway, the step (ii) and (iii) are done in the same way as in Ref. [15]. It should be noted that, to\nensure the detailed balance, loops must be constructed avoiding the tetrahedra included in {Tm }\nas well as defect tetrahedra in which the ice rule is violated: Otherwise, the loop flip becomes\nirreversible because the flip changes \u03b1\n~.\nIn the extended loop algorithm, the loop flip procedure to reverse all colors on a loop is\nnot unique because spins can thermally fluctuate [15]. To choose an efficient method, careful\nconsideration on the energy change is necessary. In Ref. [15], the authors tested two different\n~i are\nways: (1) flip xyz and (2) flip parallel. In flip xyz, all three Cartesian components of S\n~ i \u2192 \u2212S\n~i , while in flip parallel, only parallel components S\n~ik are reversed as\nreversed as S\n~i \u2192 S\n~i \u2212 2(S\n~i * \u03b1\nS\n~ )~\n\u03b1 [see Fig. 1(b)]. The previous study revealed that, in the case of the\nsingle-ion anisotropy, only the acceptance rate for flip parallel can become one (rejection free)\nin the limit of T \u2192 0; the acceptance rate for flip xyz converges to a finite value less than unity\nas T \u2192 0 because of the effect of thermal fluctuations on the transverse component of spins [15].\nIn addition to these two updates, in this paper, we introduce another way to reverse colors, i.e.,\n(3) rotate. In rotate, one translates every spin to the neighboring site on the loop simultaneously\nin the direction in which the loop was formed [see Fig. 1(b)]. In the next section, we try the\nthree different methods and demonstrate that the most efficient method depends on the model\nparameter b.\n3. Benchmark\nIn this section, we apply the extended loop algorithm to the model given by Eq. (1). We\ndemonstrate the efficiency of loop flips in MC simulations and compare the efficiency of the\nthree methods. In the following, we show the MC results for the systems size with Ns = 16 \u00d7 83\nspins under periodic boundary conditions. To retain the ergodicity, we use the loop flip together\nwith the single-spin flip. One MC step consists of single-spin flips, followed by loop flips with\neither flip xyz, flip parallel, or rotate. In the single-spin flips, we randomly choose a new spin\nstate on the unit sphere for each spin following a procedure proposed by Marsaglia [21].\nAt low T compared to b and J, spin configurations are enforced to satisfy the 'two-up twodown' ice rule, and the acceptance rate of the single-spin flip, Psingle , is suppressed. This is\ndemonstrated in Fig. 2. On the other hand, the probability that a closed loop is successfully\nformed, Ploop , steeply increases below the nematic transition temperature Tc \u223c b, indicating\nthat almost all tetrahedra start to follow the ice rule below Tc . [For b > J, the ice rule is weakly\nviolated in the range of T & J even below Tc , but gradually satisfied for T . J, as exemplified\nin Fig. 2(d).] The acceptance rate of flips of a formed loop also increases below Tc and remains\nfinite as T \u2192 0; here, Pxyz , Pparallel , and Protate are the rate for flip xyz, flip parallel, and rotate,\nrespectively. The total acceptance rate of the loop flip is given by the product as Ploop \u00d7 Pxyz ,\nPloop \u00d7 Pparallel , and Protate \u00d7 Pparallel for each method. Hence the acceptance rate of the loop\nflip sharply increases at T < Tc , compensating the decrease of Psingle . These T dependences are\nqualitatively the same for the wide range of b, as shown in Fig. 2.\n\n\f(a) b=0.05\n0\n\n(b) b=0.2\n0\n10\n\nPparallel\n\nPloop\n\nAcceptance rate\n\nAcceptance rate\n\n10\n\n10-1\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\nProtate\nPsingle\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\nPxyz\n\n0.2\n\n(c) b=0.6\n0\n\nT\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n10-2\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n(d) b=1.5\n0\n\nT\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n1.2\n\n1.6\n\n2\n\n10\n\nAcceptance rate\n\n10\n\nAcceptance rate\n\n10-1\n\n10-1\n\n10-2\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nT\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n10-1\n\n10-2\n0\n\nT\n\nFigure 2.

Furthermore, in the present case\nwith the biquadratic interaction b, the efficiency at low T strongly depends on b. The result is\npresented in Fig. 3. For small b < 0.1, flip parallel is most efficient, while it is taken over by\nrotate in the intermediate range of 0.1 < b < 0.5, and finally by flip xyz for b > 0.5.\nThe difference of the efficiency is understood by the following consideration on the energy\nchange by the flips. Considering a given state at a finite T well below Tc , its energy measured\nfrom the ground-state energy is given by E = EJ + Eb , where EJ and Eb are the energies\ncorresponding to the first and second terms in Eq. (1), respectively. Both EJ and Eb are of\nthe order of T at low T . The three loop flips change the two contributions in different ways.\nThe flip xyz changes EJ by a certain fraction \u2206EJ but conserves Eb . Meanwhile, flip parallel\nand rotate change both of EJ and Eb by \u2206EJ and \u2206Eb , respectively. First we consider the\nlarge b limit, where E \u2243 Eb \u221d T and EJ /Eb \u221d b\u22121 . For flip xyz in which \u2206Eb = 0, we obtain\n\u2206E/T = \u2206EJ /T \u221d b\u22121 \u2192 0 as b \u2192 \u221e. Since the acceptance rate is given by exp (\u2212\u2206E/T ),\nthis consideration gives limb\u2192+\u221e Pxyz \u2192 1, that is, flip xyz becomes rejection free as b \u2192 +\u221e.\n\n\fThis is consistent with the behavior in Fig. 3. On the contrary, flip parallel and rotate cannot\nbecome rejection free for b \u2192 \u221e because they change Eb by O(T ); Pparallel and Protate converge\nto finite values less than unity at b \u2192 \u221e, respectively. Note that rotate does not change a half\nof the nearest-neighbor bond energies. This may account for why Protate > Pparallel at b \u2192 +\u221e.\n~ with larger angle. Considering that\nFor smaller b, spins deviate from the common axis Q\n2\n~\nQ is setpby Eb \u223c T and Eb is proportional to b\u03b8 (\u03b8 is a typical deviation angle), we obtain\n\u03b8 = O( T /b) for b \u226a J [22]. Since flip parallel changes EJ and Eb by O(J\u03b8 4 ) and O(b\u03b8 2 ),\nrespectively [15], we obtain \u2206E/T = \u2206Eb /T = O(1) at low T \u226a Tc for flip parallel. This\nindicates that Pparallel does not vanish even at b \u2192 0 in the nematic phase. Meanwhile, the\nother two methods change the energy as \u2206E/T = \u2206EJ /T = O(J\u03b8 2 /T ) = O(J/b) at low T and\nb \u226a J [15]. This suggests that their acceptance rates vanish as b \u2192 0 in contrast to flip parallel.\nTherefore, flip parallel becomes most efficient at b \u2192 0. These considerations are consistent\nwith the numerical results shown in Fig. 3. In the intermediate regime, i.e, 0.1 < b < 0.5, rotate\nis superior to the other two, presumably because of a remnant of the advantage of rotate over\nflip parallel at b \u2192 \u221e.\n4. Summary\nIn this paper, we have extended the loop algorithm to the classical antiferromagnetic Heisenberg\nspin models with biquadratic interaction which have spin-ice type ground-state degeneracy. The\nefficiency of the extended loop algorithm has been demonstrated in Monte Carlo simulations. We\nhave examined three different ways of loop flips, flip xyz, flip parallel, and rotate, and compared\ntheir efficiency. We have shown that the most efficient method depends on the strength of\nthe biquadratic interaction b. This b dependence has been explained by considering effects of\nthermal fluctuations on the energy changes by the loop flips.\nThis work was supported by Grant-in-Aids (No. 19052008), Global COE Program \"the\nPhysical Sciences Frontier\", and the Next Generation Super Computing Project, Nanoscience\nProgram, MEXT, Japan.\nReferences\n[1] Landau D P and Binder K 2000 A guide to Monte Carlo simulation in statistical physics (Cambridge:\nCambridge Univ.
