The reason lying in the complexity of the microstructure gives rise to different upscaling\nmethods.\nHeterogeneities having periodic microstructure play a central role in the development of upscaled\nmodels. From one side they represent an important particular case of general heterogeneous media\nand on the other there are well developed mathematical techniques (e.g. the two-scale asymptotic\nexpansion method), which help to derive formally and often rigorously the upscaled model. As\na result many physical processes in heterogeneous media having periodic microstructures are well\ninvestigated both from theoretical and from practical points of view and the periodicity assumption\nis usually a starting point for the upscaling procedures [2],[13],[15]. Although this assumption is\nvalid in only limited number of cases, mostly in artificially created materials. Therefore for practical\npurposes one should be able to deal with non- periodic structures.\nThe deterministic homogenization procedure starts from a sequence of problems {P \u03b5 }. In the\nperiodic case the heterogeneity in P \u03b5 is usually described by an \u03b5-periodic function a\u03b5 (x) = a(x/\u03b5),\nwhere a(y) is a given Y -periodic function in Rd (Y = (0, 1)d is a period: a(y + ei ) = a(y), ei is a\nunit vector, i = 1, . . . , d). Quite often the purely periodic coefficient can be generalized without\ndifficulties to the locally periodic coefficient a\u03b5 (x) = a(x, x/\u03b5) (where a(x, y) is a given Y -periodic\nfunction in y). In the following steps one has to investigate the convergence of the sequence (in a\nwide sense) and to find a limit problem P 0 . The solution of the limit problem can be used in order\nto approximate the solutions of the problems P \u03b5 for small enough \u03b5.\nThe coefficients a(y) or a(x, y) are considered in mathematical literature as given functions\nbelonging to some functional spaces, without paying much attention where they come from. The\n\u2217\n\nThis work was carried out during the tenures of a fellowship from University/ITWM in Kaiserslautern (Germany)\nand an ERCIM fellowship in Luxembourg and Norway.\n\u2021\nNTNU-IMF, Alfred Getz vei 1, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway (laptevv@mail.ru, vsevolod.laptev@math.ntnu.no)\n\n1\n\n\fconstruction of these coefficients which is important for usage of homogenization results will be\ndiscussed in this article.\nLet us assume that some process in a heterogeneous medium occupying a bounded domain\n\u03a9 \u2282 Rd can be described by some PDE(s) with (at least one) rapidly oscillated coefficient aM (x),\nwhich is non necessarily periodic. This is our initial problem P.\nAsymptotical approach applied to P means that we are not going to solve it directly, but to\nconstruct a sequence of imaginary problems {P \u03b5 } passing through P at some \u03b5\u0304:\nP \u03b50 , . . .\n\n, P \u03b5n\u22121 , P \u03b5\u0304 , P \u03b5n+1 , . . .\nk\nP\n\n, P\u03b5, . . .\n\n99K P 0 .\n\n(1)\n\nIf the sequence {P \u03b5 } is convergent in some sense to a limit problem P 0 which is easier than P\nthen the solution of P 0 can be used to approximate (in some sense) the solutions of P \u03b5 , and in\nparticular, of P \u03b5\u0304 (it is our main goal). The \"convergence of problems\" is related to convergence of\ntheir solutions, but it might be restrictive to say something more precise.\nIn the periodic case, namely when aM (x) is \u03b5\u0304-periodic in \u03a9 there is a Y -periodic function a(y)\ndefined in Rd such that aM (x) = a(x/\u03b5\u0304). The standard sequence {P \u03b5 } is based on the \u03b5-periodic\ncoefficient a\u03b5 (x) = a(x/\u03b5). a\u03b5\u0304 (x) = aM (x) and consequently the condition P \u03b5\u0304 = P is not difficult\nto satisfy. This approach cannot be used for non-periodic aM (x) since there is no such periodic\na(y) exists (except the case when the period contains the whole \u03a9). But using the sequence {P \u03b5 }\nbased on locally periodic function a(x, y), where the coefficients have the form a\u03b5 (x) = a(x, x/\u03b5),\nthe requirement P \u03b5\u0304 = P becomes much more realizable. We only need to find such function a(x, y)\nand \u03b5\u0304 that a(x, x/\u03b5\u0304) = aM (x). Therefore it is reasonable to make the following definition.\nDefinition 1.1. Let us say that a function a(x, y), (x, y) \u2208 \u03a9 \u00d7 Rd , Y -periodic in the variable y is\na two\u2013scale extension for aM (x) if there exists a positive number \u03b5\u0304 such that\n\u0010 x\u0011\n= aM (x),\n\u2200x \u2208 \u03a9.\n(2)\na x,\n\u03b5\u0304\n\nThe article is organized as follows. In the next section several ways to construct two\u2013scale\nextension for arbitrary initial coefficients aM (x) are presented. The Section 3 contains a short\nintroduction to the two-scale convergence method together with a definition and a criterion for the\nconcept of admissible test function. The criterion is needed to show that the proposed in Section 2\ntwo scale extensions are admissible test functions in the sense of the two-scale convergence. This is\nthe main purpose of Sections 4, 5, 6 (its justification consists of several results which may also be\nuseful of their own). The application to the second order elliptic equation is discussed in Section 7.\nWhy do we need this? There are both theoretical and practical reasons to consider two-scale\nextensions. First of all, they seem to be naturally related to the formal method of two-scale\nasymptotic expansions and to its rigorous version \u2013 the two-scale convergence method. If some\nmathematical model of a physical process allows the formal homogenization procedure via twoscale asymptotic expansions in the case of smooth locally periodic coefficients then as the next step\none can substitute two-scale extensions for these coefficients and check whether the homogenization\nprocedure remains working for non-periodic coefficients.\nLet us now assume that our mathematical model is based on the second order elliptic equation.\nThe two-scale extensions might be useful for better understanding of the following important questions related to the concept of the averaged coefficient:\n\u2013 its definition, existence, properties, limits of applicability, averaging size;\n\n2\n\n\f\u2013 connection between deterministic and stochastic approaches;\n\u2013 reiterative averaging (averaging of the averaged coefficient).\nThere are many algorithms currently known for practical calculation of the averaged coefficient\n(see e.g. [3],[6],[14]). Some of them (having the same local problem with periodic boundary conditions) can be recovered by a special choice of the two-scale extension. This gives them a justification\nby an asymptotical argument as well as some freedom for improvement and generalization. For\nexample it is possible to correct the averaged solution in a postprocessing step using a standard\ntechnique from homogenization theory [2, p.76]. Therefore for the practical problems like heat\ntransfer in composite materials and unsaturated flow in heterogeneous porous media the choice of\nthe two-scale extension defines a numerical method which can be used as a possible alternative to\nsuch methods as multiscale finite element method [7],[8] or heterogeneous multiscale method [5].\n\n2\n\nThree approaches to construct a two\u2013scale extension\n\nFirst of all we have the T rivial Extension:\nx \u2208 \u03a9, y \u2208 Rd .\n\na(x, y) := aM (x),\n\nBut we cannot expect something better than the constant sequence {P \u03b5 } = {P} with the limit\nproblem P 0 = P which is just as difficult to solve. This practically useless extension gives although\nan approximation to P with a perfect quality. Different two-scale extensions lead to upscaled\nproblems with different quality. At least we know that not all are bad.\nFor the other two approaches we need to know aM (x) in a neighbourhood of a point in \u03a9. Since\nthis can create some problems close to the boundary, let us assume that aM (x) can be somehow\nextended to a larger domain \u03a9\u0303 which is also bounded (if we find nothing better, we can choose\nsome value of aM (*) in \u03a9 as a constant value in \u03a9\u0303 \\ \u03a9).\nNext we need to choose \u03b5\u0304. For periodic aM (x) it is reasonable to choose \u03b5\u0304 equal to the period,\nbut in general we are free in choosing it. Let W (x) be an \u03b5\u0304\u2013cube with the center x and sides\naligned with the coordinate axes. Up to now the only restrictions on \u03b5\u0304 are: we consider \u03b5\u0304 to be\nsmall comparing to the typical size of \u03a9 and all cubes W (x), x \u2208 \u03a9 should be completely inside \u03a9\u0303.\nHaving in mind the volume averaging method it might be reasonable to call W (x) as a (cubic)\nrepresentative elementary volume (REV) around the point x.\nTwo approaches to construct the two\u2013scale extension a(x, y) for aM (x) are different in the\nsense that the first is created via continuous (Continuous Extension) and the second via discrete\n(Discrete Extension) 'motion' of W (x) in \u03a9.\n\n2.1\n\nContinuous Extension\n\nLet x be some fixed point in \u03a9.\n\u2022 First we define an auxiliary function \u00e3(x, *) at y \u2208 W (x):\n\u00e3(x, y) = aM (y),\n\ny \u2208 W (x).\n\n\u2022 Secondly we extend it to the whole Rd periodically \u2013 \u00e3(x, y) is \u03b5\u0304-periodic in y.\n\u2022 Thirdly\na(x, y) := \u00e3(x, \u03b5\u0304y)\nis defined in \u03a9 \u00d7 Rd , Y \u2013periodic in y. It satisfies (2).\n\n3\n\n\f2.2\n\nDiscrete Extension\n\nLet us assume that we have some finite partition \u03a9 = \u222aj \u03a9j , j = 1, . . . , N . \u03a9i \u2229 \u03a9j = \u2205, i 6= j. For\neach \u03a9j there is a corresponding \u03b5\u0304\u2013cube Wj = W (x\u0302j ), \u03a9j \u2286 Wj , x\u0302j is a center of Wj .\n\u2022 First for any fixed x \u2208 \u03a9 \u2229 \u03a9j we define an auxiliary function \u00e3(x, *) at y \u2208 Wj :\n\u00e3(x, y) := aM (y),\n\ny \u2208 Wj .\n\n\u2022 Secondly we extend it to the whole Rd periodically \u2013 \u00e3(x, y) is \u03b5\u0304\u2013periodic in y.\n\u2022 Thirdly\na(x, y) := \u00e3(x, \u03b5\u0304y)\nis defined in \u03a9 \u00d7 Rd , Y \u2013periodic in y. It satisfies (2).\nRemark 2.1. Both extensions are also well defined in \u03a9 \u00d7 Y (this will help to show continuity of\nsome properties in \u03a9). For \u03a9j much smaller than Wj , x\u0302j \u2208 \u03a9j the Discrete Extension can be seen\nas a discretization of the Continuous Extension.\nIn order to use the results of convergence and error estimations, one usually needs smoothness\nof a(x, y). However it is easy to see that a(x, y) are continuous neither in x nor in y (and are\nproperly defined only a.e.). Anyway, in the next sections our goal will be to show that these a(x, y)\ncan be considered as admissible test functions in the sense of two\u2013scale convergence and at least\nfor the second order elliptic equation with highly oscillated (conductivity, permeability) coefficient\nthe standard procedure [1] still works and solutions of {P \u03b5 } converge to the solution of P 0 .\nPlease note that the convergence of the solutions of {P \u03b5 } is important, but it cannot guarantee\nthat the solution of P can be well\u2013approximated with the help of the solution of the problem P 0 .\nThe approximation may fail since P \u03b5\u0304 plays a central role in the construction of the sequence and\neven if the sequence \"converges\", P 0 may be 'close' to practically useless problems P \u03b5 , for \u03b5 \u226a \u03b5\u0304\nbut still 'far' from P \u03b5\u0304 .\n\n2.3\n\nAn example of P \u03b5 for the elliptic problem P\n\nIn this example we consider the second order elliptic problem with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary\ncondition as the initial problem\nP:\n\n\u2212 \u2207 * (aM (x)\u2207u) = f\n\nin \u03a9,\n\nu|\u2202\u03a9 = 0;\n\n(3)\n\nand the sequence of problems {P \u03b5 } is\nP\u03b5 :\n\n\u2212\u2207 * (a(x, x/\u03b5)\u2207u\u03b5 ) = f\n\nin \u03a9,\n\nu\u03b5 |\u2202\u03a9 = 0,\n\n(4)\n\nij\nwhere aM (x) = {aij\nM (x)} and a(x, y) = {a (x, y)} are d \u00d7 d matrix functions in general case and\naij (x, y) is a two\u2013scale extension of aij\nM (x).\nNaturally aM (*) is required to be bounded and positive definite. Can we expect similar properties for a(x, x/\u03b5) which are important for verification that {P \u03b5 } is a sequence of solvable problems?\n\n2.4\n\nProperties of Continuous and Discrete Extensions inherited from aM (x)\n\nProposition 2.1. A property of aM (x) which is valid for all x \u2208 \u03a9\u0303 is also valid for a(x, y) in\n\u03a9\u00d7Y.\nProof. For both Continuous Extension and Discrete Extension there is a mapping z : \u03a9 \u00d7 Y \u2212\u2192 \u03a9\u0303\nthat a(x, y) = aM (z(x, y)).\n4\n\n\fCorollary 2.1. Let M be the mapping M : aM (*) \u2212\u2192 a(*, *).

For example, if bM (*) = |aM (*)| then\nb(x, y) = bM (z(x, y)) = |aM (z(x, y))| = |a(x, y)|. Similar with others.\n[4].\n\n3\n\nWe note that M for the Discrete Extension has some similarity with the unfolding operator T\n\nTwo\u2013scale convergence and admissible test functions\n\nThe concept of two\u2013scale convergence was introduced in [11] and further developed in [1]. A\nrecent review of a two\u2013scale convergence in Lp (\u03a9) space can be found in [10]. In this section\nwe formulate some results related to two\u2013scale convergence in L2 (\u03a9) mainly following [1], but\nwith some modifications of the concept of admissible test function. We will need these results in\nSection 6.\nDefinition 3.1. Let BT F = D(\u03a9 \u00d7 Y ) be a base space of test functions.\nA function f (x, y) initially defined a.e. in \u03a9 \u00d7 Y we can extend to a Y \u2013periodic function in\n\u03a9 \u00d7 Rd by periodical repetition, except perhaps the points periodic to \u2202Y .\nLemma 3.1. For any Y \u2013periodic function \u03c8(x, y) \u2208 C(\u03a9 \u00d7 Y )\nZ\nZ Z\nx\nlim\n\u03c8(x, ) dx =\n\u03c8(x, y) dx dy\n\u03b5\u21920 \u03a9\n\u03b5\n\u03a9 Y\n\n(5)\n\nProof. For example see [12].\nIn the following we will deal with sequences {u\u03b5 }. u\u03b5 is a pair (u, \u03b5) \u2208 L2 (\u03a9)\u00d7R+ . The sequence\n{u\u03b5 } is a sequence of pairs {(un , \u03b5n )}\u221e\nn=0 where {\u03b5n } is a fixed sequence of strictly positive numbers\ntending to zero. \"lim \" is the same as \" n\u2192\u221e\nlim \".\n\u03b5\u21920\n\n\u03b5=\u03b5n\n\nDefinition 3.2. A sequence {u\u03b5 (x)} from L2 (\u03a9) is said to be two-scale convergent to a limit\nu0 (x, y) \u2208 L2 (\u03a9 \u00d7 Y ) if\n(i) for all \u03c8 \u2208 BT F :\n\nZ\n\nx\nlim\nu\u03b5 (x)\u03c8(x, ) dx =\n\u03b5\u21920 \u03a9\n\u03b5\n\nZ Z\n\u03a9\n\nu0 (x, y)\u03c8(x, y) dx dy\n\n(6)\n\nY\n\n(ii) u\u03b5 is bounded in L2 (\u03a9).\nWe prefer to insure that all two-scale convergent sequences are bounded. Having chosen BT F\nsomewhat larger, for instance L2 [\u03a9; Cper (Y )] we would have (i) \u21d2 (ii) due to weak convergence of\nu\u03b5 . We refer to [10] for the discussion of this topic and for the definitions of the functional spaces\nlike L2 [\u03a9; Cper (Y )].\n5\n\n\fRemark 3.1. The Def. 3.2 has sense since the limit u0 (x, y) is unique as an element of L2 (\u03a9 \u00d7 Y )\ndue to density of BT F in L2 (\u03a9 \u00d7 Y ) and at least the following sequences are two-scale convergent:\n1. If \u03c6(x, y) \u2208 C(\u03a9 \u00d7 Y ) then u\u03b5 (x) = \u03c6(x, x/\u03b5) two-scale converges to \u03c6(x, y).\n2. If u\u03b5 (x) \u2192 u(x) in L2 (\u03a9) then u\u03b5 (x) two-scale converges to u0 (x, y) = u(x).\nProof. In both cases u\u03b5 is bounded. The first statement is a consequence of Lem. 3.1. To use\nLem. 3.1 in the second statement we should approximate u(x) by a smooth function in L2 (\u03a9).\n\u221e (Y )].\nRemark 3.2. Usually in the definition of the two\u2013scale convergence one uses BT F = D[\u03a9; Cper\n\nIf we want to check that some sequence {u\u03b5 } is two\u2013scale convergent then it is better to have\npossibly smaller set of test functions (BT F ). But if we already know that {u\u03b5 } is two\u2013scale convergent (for example from compactness result, see Cor. 3.1) then it is desirable to be much more free\nin choosing \u03c8 for (6).\nDefinition 3.3. A Y \u2013periodic function \u03c6(x, y) square integrable in \u03a9\u00d7Y with well defined \u03c6(x, x/\u03b5)\nin L2 (\u03a9) for all \u03b5 \u2208 {\u03b5n } is called an admissible test function (ATF) if for all two-scale convergent\nsequences {u\u03b5 } with a limit u0 (x, y) holds:\nZ Z\nZ\nx\nu0 (x, y)\u03c6(x, y) dx dy.\nlim\nu\u03b5 (x)\u03c6(x, ) dx =\n\u03b5\u21920 \u03a9\n\u03b5\n\u03a9 Y\nPlease note that we do not consider \u03c6 to be an element of L2 (\u03a9 \u00d7 Y ) since different representatives \u03c6\u0304(x, y), \u03c6\u0304 \u0304(x, y) of the same element \u03c6 \u2208 L2 (\u03a9 \u00d7 Y ) may have \u03c6\u0304(x, x\u03b5 ) 6= \u03c6\u0304 \u0304(x, x\u03b5 ) in L2 (\u03a9),\nor even \u03c6\u0304(x, x\u03b5 ) \u2208\n/ L2 (\u03a9).\nTheorem 3.1. (see [1], Th.1.2.) From any bounded sequence {u\u03b5 } in L2 (\u03a9) it is possible to extract\na subsequence {u\u2032\u03b5 } and there exists u0 (x, y) \u2208 L2 (\u03a9 \u00d7 Y ) so that for all \u03c6(x, y) \u2208 L2 [\u03a9; Cper (Y )]:\nZ Z\nZ\nx\nu0 (x, y)\u03c6(x, y) dx dy.\nlim\nu\u2032\u03b5 (x)\u03c6(x, ) dx =\n\u03b5\u21920 \u03a9\n\u03b5\n\u03a9 Y\nCorollary 3.1. From any bounded sequence {u\u03b5 } in L2 (\u03a9) it is possible to extract a two-scale\nconvergent subsequence.\nProof. BT F = D(\u03a9 \u00d7 Y ) \u2282 L2 [\u03a9; Cper (Y )].\nCorollary 3.2. All functions from L2 [\u03a9; Cper (Y )] are ATF.\nProof. Let us assume the opposite: \u03c6(x, y) \u2208 L2 [\u03a9; Cper (Y )] and u\u03b5 (x) two-scale converges to\nu0 (x, y), but there exists \u03b4 > 0, subsequence {u\u2032\u03b5 } that\nZ Z\nZ\n\u2032\nu0 (x, y)\u03c6(x, y) dx dy| \u2265 \u03b4.\n(7)\nu\u03b5 (x)\u03c6(x, x/\u03b5) dx \u2212\n|\n\u03a9\n\n\u03a9\n\nY\n\nFrom Def. 3.2(ii), Th. 3.1 there exists a subsequence u\u2032\u2032\u03b5 in u\u2032\u03b5 that for all \u03c8(x, y) \u2208 L2 [\u03a9; Cper (Y )]\nZ\nZ Z\nx\n\u2032\u2032\nlim\nu\u03b5 (x)\u03c8(x, ) dx =\nu1 (x, y)\u03c8(x, y) dx dy.\n\u03b5\u21920 \u03a9\n\u03b5\n\u03a9 Y\nu1 (x, y) = u0 (x, y) due to the uniqueness of the two-scale limit of {u\u2032\u2032\u03b5 }.

Note that v\u03b5 must be bounded in assumptions of Th.1.8 and\nhere it is due to (ii) in Def. 3.2.\nCorollary 3.3. Necessary conditions (8) are also sufficient for a function to be ATF.\nProof. In Th. 3.2, u\u03b5 (x) = \u03c6(x, x/\u03b5). \u03c6 satisfies conditions (8). v\u03b5 is an arbitrary two-scale\nconvergent sequence. By Def. 3.3 \u03c6 is ATF.\nWith the help of (8) we can verify whether a particular function is ATF. The condition (8b)\nalone is not enough [12, Rem. 1.4.5].

For\narbitrary \u03c6 \u2208 BT F we can choose p = 1 and \u03c6\u03c8 \u2208 C(\u03a9 \u00d7 Y ) instead of \u03c6 in Cor. 6.1 to verify (8a).\nThe second condition (8b) is again a consequence of Cor. 6.1 with p = 2 and \u03c6 = \u03c8 2 \u2208 C(\u03a9\u00d7Y ).\n\n7\n\nApplication to the elliptic equation\n\nWe return back to the practical problem from the Subsection 2.3.\nIn the context of two-scale convergence, the sequence of problems (4) was investigated in [1],\u00a72.\nNow what is required is to go through the proofs in order to convince ourselves that they still work\nin our case when a(x, y) is a two\u2013scale extension of aM (x).\n\u03b1|\u03be|2 \u2264 \u03be T aM (x)\u03be,\n\n|aM (x)\u03be| \u2264 \u03b2|\u03be|\n\nin \u03a9\u0303, for any \u03be \u2208 Rd\n\nimplies that (Cor. 2.1)\n\u03b1|\u03be|2 \u2264 \u03be T a(x, y)\u03be,\n\n|a(x, y)\u03be| \u2264 \u03b2|\u03be|\n\nin \u03a9 \u00d7 Y , for any \u03be \u2208 Rd\n\nFor any \u03b5 > 0, a(x, x/\u03b5) is measurable in \u03a9 provided aM (*) is measurable in \u03a9\u0303 (Prop. 4.4, Prop. 5.4,\n\u03c6 \u2261 1). Therefore for f \u2208 L2 (\u03a9) the problems (4) are uniquely solvable and their solutions are\nuniformly bounded in H01 (\u03a9).\nTheorem 7.1.

Therefore it is still possible in this case to\npass to the two-scale limit in [1], (2.10) to obtain [1], (2.11). The remaining part is given by [1],\nProof of T.2.3.\nWe note that the uniqueness of the solution to the limit problem resulting in the convergence of the\nwhole sequence (not just some subsequence) is important to insure that the solution to the initial\nproblem P = P \u03b5\u0304 belongs to the convergent sequence.\n17\n\n\fWhat can we say about the averaged coefficient A? In the case of the Continuous Extension\na(x, y) this coefficient should be calculated at each point x \u2208 \u03a9 and it depends on the initial\ncoefficient aM (*) in \u03b5\u0304-cube W (x) around x. What happens with A if we slightly move from x to\nx+h? For small enough h the volume W (x) has a large intersection with W (x+h) and consequently\nthe coefficients a(x, *), a(x + h, *), which play a crucial role in the cell problem, differ from each\nother only in a small volume. Therefore continuity of the averaged coefficient depends on the form\nof cell problem.\nProposition 7.1. The coefficient A(x) calculated from the Continuous Extension a(x, y) is continuous in \u03a9.\nProof. Although our cell problem (needed for calculation of A(x)) is formulated in Y and has a\n1 (Y ) \\ R such that\nvariational form: find wj (x, *) \u2208 Hper\nZ\nZ\n1\n\u2207y \u03c6(y)T a(x, y)ej dy\n\u2200\u03c6 \u2208 Hper\n(Y ) \\ R,\n\u2207y \u03c6(y)T a(x, y)\u2207y wj (x, y) dy = \u2212\nY\n\nY\n\nwe prefer to deal with the cell problem in terms of aM (*), not in a(*, *). To do this it is better to\nsubstitute \u03b5\u0304-periodic functions for Y -periodic:\nz\n\u03c6\u0303(z) := \u03c6( ),\n\u03b5\u0304\n\nz\nw\u0303j (x, z) := wj (x, ),\n\u03b5\u0304\n\nz\n\u00e3(x, z) = a(x, )\n\u03b5\u0304\n\nAfter this substitution the integrals will be over \u03b5\u0304Y from \u03b5\u0304-periodic functions in z.

Together with similar estimations for S\u2212 we have the continuity of Aij (x).\nIn the case of the Discrete Extension a(x, y), the averaged coefficient A(x) is constant in each\n\u03a9k (k = 1, . . . , N ). To determine it one has to solve N cell problems (21),(22) with x = x\u0302k (centers\nof Wk ). This case is realizable in comparison to solving the cell problems at each point in \u03a9. On the\nother hand the averaged coefficient being continuous can be interpolated between a finite number\nof points where it is calculated via cell problems. Here one should be careful since for small \u03b5\u0304 the\naveraged coefficient A(x) is as oscillatory as the initial coefficient aM (*). Increasing \u03b5\u0304 we expect\nA(x) to become a function with more and more slow variations and in the subdomains of \u03a9 where\nthe coefficient aM (*) can be classified as 'spatially homogeneous' it might be close to a constant\ncoefficient.\nIn Section. 2 we had a restriction on \u03b5\u0304 from above: \u03b5\u0304 should be small in comparison with the\ntypical size of \u03a9. Solving the limit problem numerically with some typical discretization step h\nprovides a restriction for \u03b5\u0304 from below: roughly speaking, \u03b5\u0304 should not be smaller than h.\nSolving numerically the large number of cell problems is a time consuming task, which can be\ndone in parallel since cell problems are independent from each other and the limit problem. The\ncomputational resources can be also saved at least in the following cases:\n\u2022 aM (x) has slow variations (for example it can be a constant) in some subdomain \u03a9sv \u2282 \u03a9.

In this paper we propose a way to correspond an averaged (limit) problem for the\ninitial microscopical problem with non-periodic rapidly oscillated coefficient using the results from\nhomogenization together with a special choice of a(x, y) \u2013 the two-scale extension of the initial\ncoefficient. The results from homogenization (if not formal) usually require some conditions (like\nits smoothness) on a(x, y). The lack of smoothness e.g. in the two-scale convergence method can\nbe partially compensated by the \"admissibility\" of the two-scale extensions, so that e.g. for the\nsecond order elliptic equation the convergence of u\u03b5 to u0 still holds as in the periodic case.\nTo show that this approach can be useful we present here a 1D example where aM (x) from\n(3) and A(x) from (18) are plotted in Fig. 1(a,b) respectively. To calculate A(*), the Continuous\nextension for \u03b5\u0304 = 0.1 was used. The semi-analytical solutions u(x) (solid line) and u0 (x) (dots)\ncorresponding to f (x) = \u22123 sin(10x) are compared in Fig. 1(c).\nIn a 2D test presented in [9] a fine scale reference solution to P is compared with a H 1 -corrected\ncoarse solution to P 0 (this classical correction is described e.g. in [2, p.76]). A(x) in P 0 is calculated\nvia the Discrete extension of a randomly generated smooth 2D function aM (*).\nIn consequent publications we are planning to present numerical results for the elliptic problem\nin 1D and 2D more systematically together with some other two-scale extensions.\n\n21\n\n\fReferences\n[1] G.
