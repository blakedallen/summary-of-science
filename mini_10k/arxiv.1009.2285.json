[1] The long-range orientational order is a salient\nfeature of these systems that results in an unprecedented richness of ground-state structures and\ntextural behavior associated with the uniform alignment of molecules on the scale of nanometers\nand their slowly varying patterns on the scale of microns. In uniaxial nematic LCs, local average\nmolecular orientations are described by the director field n(r), which is also the optical axis. LC\nordering can be polar or non-polar, uniaxial or biaxial, and with varying degrees of positional\nordering. There are, however, no three dimensional (3D) labeling-free optical imaging\ntechniques for probing all of these ordering features at the same time, although a substantial\nprogress in LC imaging has been achieved by the use of fluorescence confocal polarizing\nmicroscopy (FCPM) [2] and several nonlinear optical microscopy techniques, such as second\nharmonic generation (SHG), [3] third harmonic generation, [4] multi-photon excitation\nfluorescence (MPEF), [5] sum frequency generation, [6] and coherent anti-Stokes Raman\nscattering polarizing microscopy (CARS-PM). [7-9] We describe a multimodal nonlinear optical\npolarizing microscopy (MNOPM) allowing for such non-invasive 3D imaging by combining\nsimultaneous broadband CARS, MPEF and multi harmonic generation (MHG) imaging\nmodalities [10,11] with the achromatic control of polarization of excitation beams using twisted\nnematic polarization rotator [12].\nThe schematic diagram of the setup is shown in Fig. 1. A tunable (680-1080nm)\nfemtosecond Ti:Sapphire oscillator (140fs, 80MHz, Chameleon Ultra-II, Coherent) is used for\nexcitation of CARS-PM, MPEF, and MHG signals. For CARS imaging, a femtosecond pulse\nfrom the laser beam is split into a pump/probe beam and another beam synchronously pumping a\n\n2\n\n\fhighly nonlinear polarization maintaining photonic crystal fiber (PCF, FemtoWHITE-800, NKT\nphotonics); the output of the PCF (marked \"A\" in Fig.1) is used as a synchronized broadband\nStokes pulse. A Faraday isolator protects the Ti:Sapphire laser from the back-reflection of the\nPCF. Laser line filters (i.e., LL01-780, Semrock) are used to reduce the spectral bandwidth of\npump/probe pulse. The pump/probe and Stokes pulses (marked \"B\" and \"C\" in Fig.1,\nrespectively) are recombined spatially at a long pass filter (such as BLP01-785R, Semrock) and\ntemporally by using delay lines in each beam path and then introduced into a laser scanning unit\n(FV-300, Olympus). Power and polarization of pulses in different parts of the setup are\ncontrolled by half wave plates and Glan laser polarizers. Both pump/probe and Stokes pulses are\nfocused into a sample using an oil-immersion objective (100x, NA=1.4) of an inverted\nmicroscope (IX-81, Olympus). A galvano-mirror scans the sample laterally in the focal plane of\nthe objective while the motion of the objective along the microscope's optical axis is controlled\nby a stepper motor. MNOPM signals are collected by either the same objective (epi-detection\nmode) and/or another oil-immersion objective (60x, NA=1.42) in forward mode and detected by\nphotomultiplier tubes (H5784-20, Hamamatsu). A series of long-pass dichroic mirrors (i.e.,\nFF735-Di01-25x36, Semrock) and short-pass and band pass filters (BPFs) are used for spectral\nselection of CARS, MPEF and SHG in the detection channels. We utilized excitation pulses with\ncollinear polarizations controlled by a twisted nematic polarization rotator. Polarization of the\nforward-detected signals was set by rotating polarizers.\nLC samples were prepared between two glass plates of thickness 0.17mm, separated by a\ngap varied within 10-40\u03bcm using spherical particle spacers. To set the surface boundary\nconditions, we treated their inner surfaces with dilute (2wt.%) aqueous solutions of DMOAP\n(N,N-dimethyl-n-octadecyl-3-aminopropyl-trimethoxysilyl chloride) for n(r) perpendicular to\n\n3\n\n\fthe glass plates or with unidirectionally rubbed polyimide (PI-2555, HD Microsystems) coatings\nfor planar alignment. The cells were filled with one of the following room-temperature LCs:\nferroelectric SmC* (Felix 015-100), or SmA (8CB, 4-cyano-4-octylbiphenyl), or cholesteric\nobtained by mixing 5CB (4-cyano-4-pentylbiphenyl) with chiral dopant (cholesteryl pelargonate,\nSigma-Aldrich). All LCs were obtained from EM Chemicals. For CARS-PM imaging, we chose\nthe CN stretching vibration (2236 cm-1) of 8CB and 5CB molecules parallel to the long\nmolecular axis, since its spectral location is far from other vibrations.\nFigure 2 shows three-photon excitation fluorescence (3PF) and SHG forward-detection\nimages of SmC* in an untreated cell obtained using a 1050nm excitation pulse (~1mW) for two\northogonal polarizations. The spectra and selecting filters corresponding to 3PF and SHG images\nare shown in Fig. 2(i,j). The in-plane images and vertical cross-sections match well for all\npolarizations of excitation beams (Fig. 2). The strong SHG signal at 525nm [Fig. 2(i)] reveals the\npolar ordering and corresponding biaxial director structure of the SmC* phase with focal conic\ndomains [1], matching that revealed by 3PF images in Fig. 2(a-h).\nTo demonstrate the feasibility of simultaneous CARS-PM, 2PF, and 3PF imaging, we\nused 3\u03bcm melamine resin spheres labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and suspended\nin 8CB having SmA layers perpendicular to the glass plates of the cell, Fig. 3. The spectra of\nMNOPM signals along with selection filters corresponding to different imaging modalities are\nshown in Fig. 3(b,c). Figure 3(d-l) shows in-plane and vertical cross-sectional images of the\n30\u03bcm-thick sample obtained in three different MNOPM modalities and for excitation light\npolarization orthogonally to the rubbing direction: (i) 3PF (via self-fluorescence of 8CB due to\nthree photon excitation at 870nm), (ii) CARS-PM (excitation using 780nm pump/probe and\nbroadband Stokes pulses), and (iii) 2PF (fluorescence from FITC-labeled particles with two-\n\n4\n\n\fphoton excitation at 980nm). CARS-PM images due to CN-vibration with the signal centered at\n~664nm (CARS frequency is related to that of pump/probe and Stokes pulses as \u03bdCARS =\n2\u03bdpump/probe - \u03bdStokes) were forward-detected, Fig. 3(g-i). All images reveal that n(r) is along the\nrubbing direction far from the inclusion but distorted around the spherical particle as\nschematically shown in Fig. 3a. The broadband CARS spectrum of 8CB, Fig. 3(c), shows the\ncapability of imaging by use of other spectral lines, i.e., those due to \u03bd(CC) and \u03bd(CH) vibrations.\nSubmicron resolution of MNOPM along the optical axis is enabled by the nonlinear\noptical nature of the used processes and is demonstrated using vertical cross-sectional images of\n~30\u03bcm-thick cells (Fig. 4) that have planar ground-state cholesteric structure shown in Fig. 4(b).\n2PF image in Fig. 4(a) shows such a structure with defects and was obtained for a cholesteric LC\ndoped with BTBP (n,n'-bis(2,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)-3,4,9,10-perylene dicarboximide) by the use\nof 980nm excitation and detection marked on the respective spectrum shown in Fig. 4(c). Similar\nco-located high-resolution images were obtained in 3PF and CARS-PM modalities without the\nuse of dyes, Fig. 4(d,e).\nImages in different modes are consistent with each other and with comparative FCPM\nstudies of similar LC samples. The intensity of detected MNOPM signals depends on the angle\nbetween the collinear polarizations of excitation pulses and n(r) as ~ cos2i\u03b8 \uf020for the detection\nwith no polarizers and as ~ cos2(i+1)\u03b8\n\n\uf020with a polarizer in the detection channel collinear with the\n\npolarizations of excitation beams, where i is the order of the nonlinear process. Imaging in 2PF\nand SHG modes involves second-order nonlinear processes, whereas CARS-PM, 3PF, and third\nharmonic generation are third-order nonlinear processes. Therefore, MNOPM images in all\nmodalities have a stronger sensitivity to spatial variations of n(r) compared to single-photon\nFCPM imaging. Because of the near-infrared excitation, light scattering due to the thermal\n\n5\n\n\ffluctuations of n(r) is relatively small and MNOPM imaging can be done for thick LC sample of\nthickness ~100\u03bcm, which is impossible to achieve using FCPM [2,12]. Compared to the FCPM\nwith the visible-light excitation MNOPM imaging is less affected by artifacts such as those due\nto light defocusing caused by LC birefringence and the Mauguin effect resulting in the light\npolarization following the slowly-twisting n(r) when the twist occurs in the direction along the\nmicroscope's optical axis. We note that FCPM would be unable to visualize the structure of\n5CB-based cholesteric shown in Fig. 4 due to the Mauguin effect [12]. The technique can\npotentially be extended to probe dynamic processes in LCs and LC composites associated with\ntemporal changes of n(r) due to application of fields and flow, similar to that recently\ndemonstrated by using the 2PF mode of nonlinear optical microscopy and dye-doped LCs [13].\nAdditional studies are needed to explore the possible influence of MNOPM excitation beams of\ntypical power ~1mW on the n(r) of studied LC structures in various experimental conditions. [8]\nIn conclusion, MNOPM is capable of non-invasive 3D labeling-free imaging of LC\ndirector fields with simultaneous probing of polarity in their self-assembly, enabling direct\ncharacterization of devices and displays. This polarizing imaging technique is a cost-effective\nmerging of broadband CARS-PM with MPEF and MHG microscopies and is especially\nattractive for the study of materials that might exhibit biaxial nematic and smectic phases by use\nof different chemical bonds of molecules and consecutive comparative polarization analysis of\nsignals.\nThis work was supported by the Renewable and Sustainable Energy Initiative,\nInternational Institute for Complex Adaptive Matter, and by NSF grants DMR-0820579, DMR0844115, DMR-0645461, and DMR-0847782.
