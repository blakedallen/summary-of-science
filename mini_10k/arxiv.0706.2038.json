In perhaps its most natural setting the Airy distribution characterises the area\nswept out by a Brownian excursion, i.e. the area under the Wiener process W (t )\n\nconditioned such that W (0) = 0 , W (1) = 0 with W (t ) > 0 for 0 < t < 1 . See [2] for a\nderivation from a path integral perspective, and [12] for an excellent overview of the\nwider class of Brownian area problems, many of which share similar features. It is\nknown that the area moments of a Brownian excursion and hence the moments of the\nAiry distribution are given by [13,14];\n\nMn =\n\n4 \u03c0 n!\nKn\n\u0393( 3n2\u22121 )2 n / 2\n\n(1)\n\nwith K 0 = \u22121 / 2, K1 = 1 / 8 whilst for n \u2265 2 one has the quadratic recursion\nn \u22121\n\u239b 3n \u2212 4 \u239e\nKn = \u239c\n\u239f K n\u22121 + \u2211 K j K n\u2212 j .\n\u239d 4 \u23a0\nj =1\n\n(2)\n\nSlightly different definitions of the Airy distribution exist in the literature [12] which\nare equivalent up to a scaling of the area variable, e.g., in [1] the moments\n\n\u03bc n = ( 8 ) n M n = 2 \u03c0 \u03a9 n / \u0393( 3n2\u22121 ) , where \u03a9 n = K n 2 n+1 n! are the so-called Airy\nconstants. In all cases, however, the recursion (2) plays a fundamental role, and it is\nthis object we focus on. It is easy to iterate (2) for small values of n ; however, it has\nbeen a long-standing challenge to identify a simple closed-form solution for K n\nwhich is valid for general n . Below we will show that for all n \u2265 1\n\n2\n\n\fKn =\n\n\u221e\n\nz 3( n\u22121) / 2\ndz\n4\u03c0 2 0 Ai 2 ( z ) + Bi 2 ( z )\n3\n\n\u222b\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Ai( z ) and Bi( z ) are the standard, linearly independent solutions of Airy's\ndifferential equation F \u2032\u2032( z ) \u2212 zF ( z ) = 0 .\n\nTo derive this rather elegant result we will first solve another problem, similar to\nbut distinct from the Brownian excursion problem described above, building on the\nwork presented in [15]. This ancillary problem finds application in determining the\nlimiting behaviour of various models associated with discrete time queues [16],\ncellular automaton traffic jam models [17] etc. To set the scene, consider a stochastic\nprocess, y (t ) , which evolves via the Langevin equation\n\ndy (t )\n= \u2212\u03b7 + \u03be (t )\ndt\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03be (t ) is a zero mean noise source with correlator \u03be (t )\u03be (t \u2032) = \u03b4 (t \u2212 t \u2032) such that\n\n\u03be (t ) dt = dW (t ) . Thus y (t ) is a drifted Brownian motion. Suppose the motion starts at\ny (t = 0) = x > 0 with drift parameter \u03b7 > 0 , and let t f denote the time at which the\nt\n\nf\nprocess first crosses y = 0 . Then the variable A = \u222b 0 y (t \u2032) dt \u2032 defines the area swept\n\nout by the process till this first-passage time. One would like to know the probability\ndensity, P( A, x) , of this area variable. This was considered in [15] where it was\nshown, using a backward Fokker-Planck technique, that the Laplace transform of the\n\u221e\n~\nprobability density P ( s, x) \u2261 \u222b P( A, x)e \u2212 sA dA satisfies (for convenience and clarity\n0\n\nwe work hereafter in units where \u03b7 = 1 )\n~\n~\n1 \u2202 2 P ( s, x) \u2202P ( s, x)\n~\n\u2212\n\u2212 sxP ( s, x) = 0\n2\n2 \u2202x\n\u2202x\n\n(5)\n\n~\n~\nsubject to the boundary conditions P ( s, x = 0) = 1 and P ( s, x \u2192 \u221e) = 0 . The solution\nis given by\n\n3\n\n\fAi(21 / 3 s1 / 3 x + 2 \u22122 / 3 s \u22122 / 3 )\n~\nP ( s, x ) = e x\n.\nAi(2 \u2212 2 / 3 s \u2212 2 / 3 )\n\n(6)\n\nUsing this result, various asymptotic results were presented in [15] relating to the\nmoments A n and the tail of the probability density P ( A, x) as A \u2192 \u221e when x is\nsmall. It was left as a challenge to formally invert (6) to derive an explicit expression\nfor P( A, x) . We take up this challenge here.\n\nThus we seek to evaluate the contour integral\nb + i\u221e\n\n1\n~\nP ( A, x) =\nP ( s, x) e sA ds\n\u222b\n2\u03c0 i b\u2212i\u221e\n\n(7)\n\n~\nwith P ( s, x) given by (6). The approach taken is similar to that discussed in [18] in\nthe context of considering the integral of the absolute value of a Brownian bridge. We\nfirst wish to modify the contour by closing it to the left. The continuation to the left\nhand side of the complex s-plane can be accomplished by providing a cut on the\nnegative real axis. Thus one can represent s = re i\u03c6 where arg s < \u03c0 or \u2212 \u03c0 < \u03c6 < \u03c0 .\nFractional powers s \u03bc with \u03bc < 1 are to be interpreted as s \u03bc = r \u03bc e i\u03bc \u03c6 so that\n~\narg(s \u03bc ) = \u03bc \u03c6 < \u03c0 . It then follows that P ( s, x) is an analytic function on the cutplane since the zeros of Ai( z ) are restricted to the negative real axis [1]. Now, if one\nconsiders that Ai( z ) vanishes exponentially fast as z \u2192 \u221e [19]\n\n1\n\u2212 2 z3 / 2\nAi( z ) ~ \u03c0 \u22121 / 2 z \u22121 / 4 e 3 ;\n2\n\narg( z ) < \u03c0\n\nit follows that the Bromwich contour in (7) may be deformed to a Hankel-type\ncontour around the branch cut, starting at \u2212 \u221e , winding round the origin in an anticlockwise fashion and ending up at \u2212 \u221e , i.e.,\n\n4\n\n(8)\n\n\f1\nP ( A, x) =\n2\u03c0 i\n\n( 0+ )\n\n~\n\n\u222b P ( s, x ) e\n\nsA\n\nds .\n\n(9)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nBy considering the contributions above and below the branch cut one then finds that\n\nP ( A, x) =\n\nex\n2\u03c0 i\n\n\u221e\n\n\u222b\n0\n\n\u23a1 Ai(2 \u22122 / 3 e i 2\u03c0 / 3 r \u22122 / 3 (1 + e \u2212 i\u03c0 2 x r ))\n\u23a2\nAi(2 \u22122 / 3 e i 2\u03c0 / 3 r \u2212 2 / 3 )\n\u23a3\n\u2212 i 2\u03c0 / 3 \u2212 2 / 3\n\ni\u03c0\n\nAi(2 e\nr (1 + e 2 x r )) \u23a4 \u2212 rA\n\u2212\n\u23a5 e dr.\nAi(2 \u2212 2 / 3 e \u2212i 2\u03c0 / 3 r \u2212 2 / 3 )\n\u23a6\n\u22122 / 3\n\n(10)\n\nThis appears to be no more tractable than the original expression; however, a key\nsimplification comes from exploiting the identity [19]\n\n1\nAi( ze \u00b1 2\u03c0 i / 3 ) = e \u00b1 \u03c0 i / 3 [Ai( z ) m i Bi( z )]\n2\n\n(11)\n\nwhereupon (noting that e \u00b1 i\u03c0 = \u22121 ) one can recast (10) in the form\n\nP ( A, x) =\n\nex\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03c0 \u222b\n0\n\nAi(\u03c4 r \u2212 x\u03c4 r\n\n\u22121 / 2\n\n)Bi(\u03c4 r ) \u2212 Bi(\u03c4 r \u2212 x\u03c4 r\nAi 2 (\u03c4 r ) + Bi 2 (\u03c4 r )\n\n\u22121 / 2\n\n)Ai(\u03c4 r )\n\ne \u2212 A r dr\n\n(12)\n\nwith \u03c4 r \u2261 (2r ) \u22122 / 3 . This is an exact expression for the first-passage area probability\ndensity for drifted Brownian motion in terms of the integral of a real function, valid\nfor all A > 0 and x > 0 . It is, of course, not the same as the Airy distribution\ndiscussed above, but there are deep connections as we shall see shortly.\n\nTo illustrate the power and utility of (12), we first consider the asymptotic\nbehaviour of P ( A, x) as A \u2192 \u221e without making any assumption about the size of x .\nIt is clear that in the limit A \u2192 \u221e the integral is dominated by the contribution in the\nneighbourhood of r = 0 , where \u03c4 r \u2192 \u221e . The following asymptotic expansions of\n\nAi( z ) and Bi( z ) as z \u2192 \u221e are therefore useful [19];\n\n5\n\n\f\u221e\n1\n\u2212 2 z3 / 2\nAi( z ) ~ \u03c0 \u22121 / 2 z \u22121 / 4 e 3 \u2211 (\u22121) n cn z \u22123n / 2\n2\nn =0\n\n(13)\n2 3/ 2\n\nBi( z ) ~ \u03c0 \u22121 / 2 z \u22121 / 4 e 3\n\nz\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2211c z\nn =0\n\n\u22123 n / 2\n\nn\n\nwhere\n\ncn =\n\n\u0393(3n + 12 )\n.\n\u0393(n + 12 )36 n n!\n\n(14)\n\nDefining f ( z , x) \u2261 Ai( z \u2212 x z \u22121 / 2 )Bi( z ) \u2212 Bi( z \u2212 x z \u22121 / 2 )Ai( z ) , it is a straightforward\nalthough laborious task to show using (13) that as z \u2192 \u221e ,\n\nf ( z, x) =\n\n[\n\n]\n\n1\n1\n\u239b 1 \u239e\nsinh x \u2212\nx 2 cosh x \u2212 x sinh x + O \u239c 7 / 2 \u239f .\n1/ 2\n2\n\u03c0z\n4\u03c0 z\n\u239dz \u23a0\n\n(15)\n\nThis is sufficient to develop the first two terms in an asymptotic expansion of P( A, x)\nas A \u2192 \u221e since, to the required order, (12) now simplifies to,\n\nP ( A, x) ~\n\ne x sinh x\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u222b\n0\n\n\u23a1 \u239b x 2 coth x \u2212 x 5 \u239e\n\u23a4 \u2212 A r \u2212 32r\n+ \u239f\u239f r + O(r 2 )\u23a5 e\ndr .\n\u23a21 \u2212 \u239c\u239c\n2\n12 \u23a0\n\u23a3 \u239d\n\u23a6\n\n(16)\n\nOne can easily evaluate the integrals in (16) using the result [20]\n\u221e\n\n\u03bd /2\n\n\u239b\u03b2 \u239e\n\u03bd \u22121 \u2212\u03b1 r \u2212 \u03b2 / r\ndr = 2\u239c \u239f\n\u222b0 r e\n\u239d\u03b1 \u23a0\n\n(\n\nK\u02c6 \u03bd 2 \u03b1\u03b2\n\n)\n\n(17)\n\nwhere K\u02c6 \u03bd ( z ) is a modified Bessel function (we use \u2227 to distinguish K\u0302\u03bd from K n ).\nThe final step requires one to use the asymptotic expansion of K\u02c6 \u03bd ( z ) as z \u2192 \u221e [19]\n\n6\n\n\f\u239b\u03c0 \u239e\nK\u02c6 \u03bd ( z ) ~ \u239c \u239f\n\u239d 2z \u23a0\n\n1/ 2\n\n\u23a7 (4\u03bd 2 \u2212 1) (4\u03bd 2 \u2212 1)(4\u03bd 2 \u2212 9)\n\u23ab\n+\n+ K\u23ac\ne \u2212 z \u23a81 +\n2\n8z\n2!(8 z )\n\u23a9\n\u23ad\n\n(18)\n\nwhereupon one eventually derives as A \u2192 \u221e\n\n1/ 4\n\ne x sinh x \u239b 2 \u239e\nP ( A, x) ~\n\u239c \u239f\n\u03c0 \u239d3\u23a0\n\n\u23a7\u23aa \u239b 8 \u239e1 / 2 1 / 2 \u23ab\u23aa\n1\nexp\u23a8\u2212 \u239c \u239f A \u23ac\nA3 / 4\n\u23aa\u23ad\n\u23aa\u23a9 \u239d 3 \u23a0\n\n(19)\n1/ 2\n\u23a1\n1 \u239b 2 \u239e \u239b 13 x 2 coth x \u2212 x \u239e\n\u239b 1 \u239e\u23a4\n\u239f\u239f + O \u239c \u239f\u23a5 .\n\u00d7 \u23a21 \u2212 1 / 2 \u239c \u239f \u239c\u239c +\n2\n\u239d A \u23a0\u23a6\u23a5\n\u23a0\n\u23a3\u23a2 A \u239d 3 \u23a0 \u239d 96\n\nWe stress that this result is valid for all values of x > 0 . For x \u2192 0 one recovers the\nleading order term conjectured in [15]. The relative size of the second term provides\ninsight into the regime of validity of approximations made in the queueing problems\ndiscussed in [16,17]. With effort, one could calculate higher order terms in the\nasymptotic expansion if one felt so inclined.\nFor completeness, it is also possible to derive the behaviour of P( A, x) as A \u2192 0 .\nThe exact result (12) is of little use in this regard, since the oscillatory nature of the\nintegrand for large r is difficult to handle. However, from the Laplace transform (6)\nwe have as s \u2192 \u221e\nAi(21 / 3 s1 / 3 x) \u23a1\nx1 / 2\n~\n\u239b 1 \u239e\u23a4\nP ( s, x) = e x\n1\n\u2212\n+ O \u239c 2 / 3 \u239f\u23a5 .\n\u23a2\n1/ 2 1/ 2\nAi(0)\n\u239d s \u23a0\u23a6\n\u23a3 2 s\n\n(20)\n\nThe leading order asymptotic behaviour of P ( A, x) as A \u2192 0 is governed by the first\nterm in (20). This can be inverted exactly by noting that Ai( z ) = \u03c0 \u22121 z 3K1 / 3 ( 23 z 3 / 2 )\n[19] and by appealing to (17). The result is\n\nP ( A, x) ~\n\n21 / 3 xe x \u22122 x3 / 9 A\ne\n32 / 3 \u0393( 13 ) A 4 / 3\n\n(21)\n\n7\n\n\fwhere we have used the fact that Ai(0) = 3\u22122 / 3 / \u0393( 23 ) [19]. In the limit x \u2192 0 this\nreduces to the exact distribution for the zero-drift case [15], valid for all A > 0 . By\nreintroducing a general drift \u03b7 through the replacements x \u2192 \u03b7 x and A \u2192 \u03b7 3 A , one\nmay readily see why this is the case.\n\nNow we turn our attention to the moments. By considering the moments from\ntwo different perspectives we will show how to derive (3). We start by writing\n\u221e\n\nA\n\n\u2261 \u222b A n P ( A, x) dA\n\nn\n\n(22)\n\n0\n\ninto which we insert the formal expression (12) for the probability density P ( A, x) .\nInterchanging the order of integration one has\n\u221e\n\nA\n\n=\n\nn\n\ne x n! Ai(\u03c4 r \u2212 x\u03c4 r\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u222b\n0\n\n\u22121 / 2\n\n)Bi(\u03c4 r ) \u2212 Bi(\u03c4 r \u2212 x\u03c4 r\nAi 2 (\u03c4 r ) + Bi 2 (\u03c4 r )\n\n\u22121 / 2\n\n)Ai(\u03c4 r ) dr\n.\nr n+1\n\n(23)\n\nWhen n = 0 the right hand side of (23) is unity for all x > 0 , although a direct\ndemonstration of this fact is difficult and has so far eluded us. Notwithstanding, it\nfollows that one cannot expand (23) in powers of x when n = 0 ; mathematically the\nreason why may be traced backed to the observation that the integral\n\u221e\n\nAi(\u03c4 r )Bi(\u03c4 r ) dr\n2\n(\u03c4 r ) + Bi 2 (\u03c4 r ) r n+1\n\n\u222b Ai\n0\n\n(24)\n\nis infinite when n = 0 . However, for n \u2265 1 this integral is finite and one can justify\nexpanding the right hand side of (23) to at least O( x 2 ) . Using the fact that the\nWronskian has a particularly simple form [19]\n\nW { Ai( z ), Bi( z )} \u2261 Ai( z )Bi\u2032( z ) \u2212 Ai\u2032( z )Bi( z ) =\n\n8\n\n1\n\n\u03c0\n\n(25)\n\n\fone obtains after a change of variables\n\nA\n\nn\n\n=\n\nxn!\n\n\u03c0\n\n2\n\n\u221e\n\n\u222b Ai (\u03c4\n2\n\n0\n\n\u03c4 r \u22121 / 2\n\ndr\n+ O( x 2 )\nn +1\nr ) + Bi (\u03c4 r ) r\n2\n\n(26)\n\u221e\n\n=\n\n3 x n+1\nz 3( n\u22121) / 2\n2\nn\n!\ndz + O( x 2 ).\n2\n2\n4\u03c0 2\nAi\n(\nz\n)\n+\nBi\n(\nz\n)\n0\n\n\u222b\n\nNext we consider the moments from the perspective of the Laplace transform,\n~\nwherein A n \u2261 (\u22121) n \u2202 ns P ( s, x) . Expanding (6) as a power series in x one has\ns =0\n\nAi\u2032(2 \u22122 / 3 s \u22122 / 3 )\n~\nP ( s, x) = 1 + x + x 21 / 3 s1 / 3\n+ O( x 2 ) .\n\u22122 / 3 \u22122 / 3\nAi(2 s )\n\n(27)\n\nThe function Ai\u2032( z ) / Ai( z ) has a well-known asymptotic expansion as z \u2192 \u221e [1,12]\n\u221e\nAi\u2032( z )\n~ 2 z 1 / 2 \u2211 (\u22121) n K n z \u22123n / 2\nAi( z )\nn =0\n\n(28)\n\nwhere K n is defined by the quadratic recurrence relation (2). It is at this point that the\nconnection with the Airy distribution becomes apparent. It follows that as s \u2192 0\n\u221e\n~\nP ( s, x) ~ 1 + x\u2211 (\u22121) n K n 2 n+1 s n + O( x 2 )\n\n(29)\n\nn =1\n\nwhich implies that\n~\n\u239b \u2202nP \u239e\nA n = (\u22121) n \u239c\u239c n \u239f\u239f = xK n 2 n+1 n!+ O( x 2 ) .\n\u239d \u2202s \u23a0 s =0\n\n9\n\n(30)\n\n\fIf we now compare (30) with (26) and equate the coefficient of the O(x) term we find\nimmediately the result for K n given by (3). As a useful check one can evaluate (3)\nexactly when n = 1 . Thus, given the form of the Wronskian (25), one has that\n\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\n\u23a1 \u22121 Bi( z ) \u23a4\n\u03c02\ndz\n=\n\u03c0\ntan\n=\n\u222b0 Ai 2 ( z ) + Bi 2 ( z ) \u23a2\u23a3 Ai( z) \u23a5\u23a6 6\n0\n\n(31)\n\nwhere the final step uses the asymptotic forms for Ai( z ) and Bi( z ) given by (13) as\nwell the fact that Ai(0) = 3\u22122 / 3 / \u0393( 23 ) and Bi(0) = 3\u22121 / 6 / \u0393( 23 ) [19]. It follows that\nK1 = 1 / 8 , as required. Numerical evaluation of (3) using Maple confirms its\n\ncorrectness for 2 \u2264 n \u2264 10 . Further, when n \u2192 \u221e one may use (13) to show that\n\u221e\n\nKn ~\n\n4 3/ 2\n3\n(3n \u22122) / 2 \u2212 3 z\nz\ne\ndz\n4\u03c0 \u222b0\n\n(32)\n=\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\n\u239b3\u239e\n\u239c \u239f\n\u239d4\u23a0\n\nn\u221e\n\nn \u22121 \u2212 y\n\u222b y e dy =\n0\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\nn\n\n\u239b3\u239e\n\u239c \u239f (n \u2212 1)!.\n\u239d4\u23a0\n\nThis result was first proved by Takacs [6,13] by studying directly the behaviour of (2)\ntogether with an alternative linear recursion relation for the K n , namely\n\nKn =\n\nn \u22121\n6n\ncn \u2212 \u2211 c j K n\u2212 j\n6n \u2212 1\nj =1\n\n(33)\n\nwhere the coefficients cn are given by (14). The present derivation is much simpler,\nand can be extended to provide higher order terms almost trivially.\n\nHaving derived (3) somewhat indirectly, it is natural to ask whether there is a\nmore direct derivation. The answer is yes, and we sketch the outline proof as follows\n(omitting the technical details). The starting point is (28), from which one can easily\nestablish the two defining recursions for K n , (2) and (33), using formal power series\nmethods; see, e.g., [12]. With considerably more effort (the difficulties associated\n\n10\n\n\fwith (28) being an asymptotic expansion need careful handling) one can justify\nwriting for n \u2265 1\n\nKn =\n\n(\u22121) n\n2\u03c0 i\n\nAi\u2032( z ) 1 3n / 2 d ( z 3 / 2 )\nz\n1/ 2\nC Ai( z ) 2 z\nz 3/ 2\n\n\u222b\n\n(34)\n=\n\n(\u22121) n 3\n2\u03c0 i 4\n\nAi\u2032( z ) 3( n\u22121) / 2\nz\ndz\nC Ai( z )\n\n\u222b\n\nwhere the contour C runs along two rays; the first from \u221e e \u2212 i 2\u03c0 / 3 to 0 and the second\nfrom 0 to \u221e e i 2\u03c0 / 3 . Taking each ray in turn, making a straightforward change of\nvariables, and noting that e \u00b1 i\u03c0 ( n\u22121) = (\u22121) n\u22121 , one can show that\n\n\u221e\n\n\u222b\n\n1 3\nKn =\n2\u03c0 i 4 0\n\n\u23a1 \u2212i 2\u03c0 / 3 Ai\u2032(e \u2212 i 2\u03c0 / 3 r ) i 2\u03c0 / 3 Ai\u2032(e i 2\u03c0 / 3 r ) \u23a4 3( n\u22121) / 2\nr\ndr.\n\u2212e\n\u23a2e\nAi(e \u2212i 2\u03c0 / 3 r )\nAi(e i 2\u03c0 / 3 r ) \u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a3\n\n(35)\n\nIt is now straightforward using (11) and (25) to show that (35) reduces to (3). It must\nbe confessed, however, that the search for this second derivation was greatly assisted\nby knowing the answer first. This, coupled with the importance of (12) in its own\nright, explains why we have presented the analysis in the way that we have.\n\nWe conclude by making two observations which might prove worthy of further\n~\nit follows from (5) that\nstudy. First, since An = A n = (\u22121) n \u2202 n P / ds n\ns =0\n\n1 d 2 An dAn\n\u2212\n= \u2212 nxAn \u22121\ndx\n2 dx 2\n\n(36)\n\nwith the boundary condition An ( x = 0) = 0 for n \u2265 1 and, by definition, A0 ( x) \u2261 1 .\nThis differential equation has the formal solution\n\u221e\n\nx\n\nAn ( x) = 2n \u222b e\n0\n\n2t\n\n\u222b ue\n\n\u22122u\n\n(37)\n\nAn\u22121 (u ) dudt\n\nt\n\n11\n\n\fwhich may be iterated to give any moment exactly, e.g., A1 ( x) = ( x + x 2 ) / 2 etc. By\ntaking the limit x \u2192 0 in (37) and by invoking (30) it follows that for n \u2265 1\n\u221e\n\n1\nKn = n\nue \u22122u An\u22121 (u ) du .\n2 (n \u2212 1)! \u222b0\n\n(38)\n\nWhether such results in conjunction with (23) add something new is unclear. Second,\nconsider a random variable Y whose probability density is given by\ny \u22121 / 3\nf ( y) = 2 2 2 / 3\n.\n\u03c0 Ai ( y ) + Bi 2 ( y 2 / 3 )\n4\n\n(39)\n\nThe moments of Y are Yn \u2261 8K n+1 for n \u2265 0 , which follows from (3) after a simple\nchange of variables. Given the ubiquitous nature of K n , it would be interesting to\nknow whether this random variable Y has a simple physical interpretation.\n\nIn summary, we have succeeded in deriving an exact expression for the\nprobability density for the area swept out by a drifted Brownian motion during its first\npassage time. Using this result it has proved possible to derive a simple closed-form\nsolution for K n , and hence the moments of the Airy distribution, in terms of the Airy\nfunctions Ai( z ) and Bi( z ) . As well as being of mathematical interest, the results are\napplicable to a wide variety of physical problems.\n\n12\n\n\fReferences\n\n[1]\n\nFlajolet P and Louchard G 2001 Algorithmica 31 361\n\n[2]\n\nMajumdar S N and Comtet A 2005 J.
