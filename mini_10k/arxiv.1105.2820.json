In the local universe, low-mass galaxies are analogs to these\nhigh-redshift \"building blocks.\" By studying nearby low mass galaxies, in particular low\nmass irregular galaxies, we can gain detailed insight into the basic physical processes at\nwork in these systems, which are different than those in spirals or ellipticals due to their\nsmaller mass. Studying the interstellar medium (ISM) of irregular galaxies is particularly\nimportant because their ISM is strongly influenced by star formation and interactions, which\nsignificantly affect the future evolution of these galaxies.\nThere have been a number of surveys of low mass irregular galaxies aimed at investigating the properties of the neutral and ionized gas components of the ISM and the contributions\nto the ISM by the stellar components (e.g., Hunter & Elmegreen 2004; Hunter et al. 2006;\nHunter & Elmegreen 2006; Hunter et al. 2007, 2010). Relatively little attention, however,\nhas been paid to the magnetic field component of the interstellar medium.\nIn general, the magnetic field energy is thought to be in equipartition with the turbulent and cosmic ray energies (Zweibel & Heiles 1997; Ferri\u00e8re 2001; Cox 2005; although see\nChi & Wolfendale 1993 for a contrasting view) and is thus an important part of the interstellar medium. In the few irregular galaxies with measured magnetic fields (Haynes et al.\n1986, 1991; Chy\u017cy et al. 2000; Chyzy et al. 2000; Chy\u017cy et al. 2003; Gaensler et al. 2005;\nMao et al. 2008; Kepley et al. 2010; Chy\u017cy et al. 2011), the magnetic fields are comparable\nin strength to those in larger spirals like the Milky Way (Ferri\u00e8re 2001; Wielebinski 2005)\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nand M51 (Beck et al. 1987). Therefore, in irregular galaxies, the magnetic field may play a\nmore important role in the dynamics of the ISM than in spiral galaxies. Magnetic fields also\nchannel gas flows and distribute and accelerate cosmic rays (Beck 2005; Everett et al. 2008,\n2010). Irregular galaxies have shallow potential wells that are easily disrupted and potentially have a significant amount of their mass expelled from the galaxy (Ferrara & Tolstoy\n2000; Tremonti et al. 2004). Magnetic fields may either help the baryons escape or help to\nconfine them to the galaxy depending on the structure of the magnetic fields (Tomisaka 1990;\nMineshige et al. 1993; de Avillez & Breitschwerdt 2005; Everett et al. 2008, 2010). Finally,\nthe presence of significant magnetic fields in irregular galaxies raises the question of how they\nwere generated in the first place. The main ingredients in generating and sustaining galactic\nmagnetic fields are generally thought to be large-scale shear and small-scale turbulence. The\nwell known \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c9 dynamo models are based on these effects (although see Zweibel & Heiles\n1997, Kulsrud 1999, , and Kulsrud & Zweibel 2008 for critiques of this model). In the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c9\ndynamo, differential rotation (\u03c9) is used to stretch small-scale turbulence (\u03b1) leading to an\nincrease in magnetic field strength and the presence of a large-scale magnetic field. It may\nbe harder for \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c9 dynamos to operate in irregular galaxies because they rotate mostly as\nsolid bodies and their ISM is more easily disrupted because of their smaller potential wells.\nThe strength and structure of the magnetic fields in irregular galaxies provide stringent\nconstraints for dynamo models of these objects.\nAt present, only a handful of nearby galaxies have detailed magnetic field measurements:\nNGC 1569 (Kepley et al. 2010), the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (Haynes et al. 1986,\n1991; Klein et al. 1993; Gaensler et al. 2005; Mao et al. 2008), NGC 4449 (Chy\u017cy et al.\n2000), IC 10 (Chy\u017cy et al. 2003), NGC 6822 (Chy\u017cy et al. 2003), and IC 1613 (Chy\u017cy et al.\n2011). To better understand the role of magnetic fields in the interstellar medium of irregular\ngalaxies and how these fields are generated in these systems, we have embarked on a program\nto obtain deep, high-resolution radio continuum data on several irregular galaxies. In this\nfirst paper in this series (Kepley et al. 2010), we presented our observations of the magnetic\nfield of NGC 1569, a dwarf irregular galaxy hosting one of the most extreme starbursts in\nthe nearby universe. The magnetic field in this galaxy is shaped by its outflow and the field\nmay be playing an important role in channeling gas away from the disk.\nWork by other groups have found that the LMC, SMC, and NGC 4449 have large-scale\nordered fields like NGC 1569. The LMC has a 1 \u03bcG regular, axisymmetric spiral field, a\nrandom field of 4.1 \u03bcG, and a total field of 4.3 \u03bcG (Gaensler et al. 2005). A cosmic raydriven dynamo (Parker 1992; Hanasz et al. 2004) has been invoked to explain the presence\nof a regular field despite the vigorous recent star formation in the LMC (Gaensler et al.\n2005). The SMC has a random magnetic field strength of 3 \u03bcG and a unidirectional, regular\nfield with a strength of 1.7 \u03bcG aligned roughly along the Magellanic bridge, which suggests\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nan origin associated with the interaction between the LMC and SMC (Mao et al. 2008).\nIn contrast to the weak, but regular fields in the LMC and SMC, NGC 4449 has a strong\nuniform field of 8 \u03bcG and a total field of 14 \u03bcG (Chy\u017cy et al. 2000). The uniform field\nshows a fan-like structure in the inner regions of the galaxy and a spiral structure in the\nouter regions. A fast dynamo model including velocity shear around a bar, a wind from the\ncentral region of the galaxy, and a random field produces a magnetic field configuration very\nsimilar to that of NGC 4449 (Otmianowska-Mazur et al. 2000). In contrast to the magnetic\nfields of NGC 1569, the LMC, the SMC, and NCG 4449, the uniform fields of IC 10, NGC\n6822, and IC 1613 (as traced by the polarization of their radio continuum emission) are\neither weak or non-existent (Chy\u017cy et al. 2003). IC 10 has a diffuse, random field with a\nstrength of 14 \u03bcG in the center and 7 \u03bcG on its outskirts. NGC 6822 has a random field\nwith a maximum strength of 5 \u03bcG and IC 1613 has a random magnetic field of 2.8 \u03bcG. Both\nIC 10 and NGC 6822 have small patches of uniform fields with strengths of 2\u20133 \u03bcG on size\nscales much smaller than the size of the galaxy. Chy\u017cy et al. (2003) suggest that the fields\nin these galaxies are the result of a fluctuating dynamo (Subramanian 1998). IC 1613 shows\nno sign of uniform field; any polarized emission can be attributed to background sources\n(Chy\u017cy et al. 2011).\nThe line of sight fields determined by Gaensler et al. (2005) and Mao et al. (2008) for the\nLMC and SMC are based on the rotation measures of background sources, while the results\nfor NGC 4449, IC 10, NGC 6822, IC 1613, and NGC 1569 are based on observations of the\nradio continuum polarization. There are significant differences between the two methods.\nThe radio continuum polarization observations trace the magnetic field with cosmic ray\nelectrons, while the rotation measure observations trace the field with thermal electrons. In\naddition, only the rotation measure observations can tell a regular (i.e., coherent) field (all\none direction) from a uniform field (one orientation, but the direction uncertain by 180\u25e6 ).\nUnfortunately, current technology limits this method to nearby galaxies (e.g., LMC, SMC,\nM31) with very large angular sizes, although this situation will improve with the development\nof the Square Kilometer Array (Beck & Gaensler 2004).\nIn this paper, we focus on NGC 4214, which is classified as a mixed, S-shaped, Magellanic irregular galaxy by de Vaucouleurs et al. (1995). NGC 4214 is a well-studied galaxy\nwhose rest-frame UV spectrum strongly resembles that of star-forming galaxies at z = 3\n(Steidel et al. 1996). Observations of its stars and ionized gas (Maiz-Apellaniz et al. 1998;\nMacKenty et al. 2000; Drozdovsky et al. 2002; \u00dabeda et al. 2007a,b) show that there are two\nactive regions of star formation in the galaxy: NGC 4214-I (also referred to as the northwest\ncomplex) and NGC 4214-II (also referred to as the southeast complex). NGC 4214-I is the\nolder complex with an age of 3 to 4 Myr and consists of an H\u03b1 shell surrounding a super-star\ncluster (MacKenty et al. 2000). The H\u03b1 kinematics of NGC 4214-I show some indications of\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nexpanding shells (Martin 1998; Ma\u0131\u0301z-Apell\u00e1niz et al. 1999; Wilcots & Thurow 2001). NGC\n4214-II is slightly younger with an age of 2.5 to 3.0 Myr (MacKenty et al. 2000). The H\u03b1 in\nthis region is coincident with the star cluster, showing that the cluster has not had sufficient\ntime to clear out a large H\u03b1 cavity (MacKenty et al. 2000). Schwartz & Martin (2004) detect an outflow of cold gas in this region with a velocity of 23 km s\u22121 , which is associated\nwith a small H\u03b1 bubble. X-ray observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton show that the\nhot gas in this galaxy is centered on the star forming regions (Hartwell et al. 2004; Ott et al.\n2005a,b). The star forming regions of NGC 4214 and their associated ionized and hot gas are\nembedded in a disk of much older stars (Fanelli et al. 1997; Drozdovsky et al. 2002), which\nin turn is embedded in a neutral hydrogen envelope which extends to 1.4 times the Holmberg\nradius (5.3\u2032 )1 of this galaxy (Allsopp 1979; McIntyre 1997).\nThe distance to NGC 4214 is controversial, with distances used in the literature ranging\nfrom 2 Mpc (Hopp et al. 1999) to 7 Mpc (Allsopp 1979). We adopt a distance of 2.94 Mpc\nin this paper, which is the distance for the galaxy determined from Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the tip of the red giant branch by Ma\u0131\u0301z-Apell\u00e1niz et al. (2002). This\ndistance agrees with the tip of the red giant branch distances determined independently\nby Drozdovsky et al. (2002, 2.70 Mpc) and Dalcanton et al. (2009, 3.04 Mpc) and with the\ndistance determined using the planetary nebula luminosity function by Dopita et al. (2010,\n3.19 Mpc). It is also in reasonable agreement with distances determined by its radial velocity\nand models of the Hubble flow determined by NED2 (3.75 to 7.53 Mpc). At the adopted\ndistance, 1\u2032\u2032 is 14.2 pc.\nThe observations presented in this paper represent the most sensitive observations of\nthe radio continuum emission of NGC 4214 to date. Previous observations of the radio\ncontinuum of NGC 4214 include Allsopp (1979), Beck et al. (2000), and MacKenty et al.\n(2000). Although the resolution of our observations is lower than that of Beck et al. (2000)\nand MacKenty et al. (2000), we integrated for substantially longer (effective integration times\nranging from 5 hours to 15 hours rather than 15 minutes). Our choice of array configuration\n(see Section 2) allows us good sensitivity to both small scale features and large-scale diffuse\nemission in NGC 4214. Our observations trace the thermal emission produced by the ionizing\nradiation of young stars and the synchrotron emission produced by the detonation of old\nmassive stars, which nicely complements the new data on the stellar content of NGC 4214\nobtained by the Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope (e.g., Dopita et al.\n1\n2\n\nThe Holmberg radius is the radius where the surface brightness of a galaxy falls to 26.5 mag arcsec\u22122 .\n\nThe NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n2010) and the new data on the molecular components of the ISM obtained using Herschel\n(e.g., Cormier et al. 2010).\nWe detail our data calibration and imaging process in Section 2. In Section 3, we\npresent our observations in detail. Section 4 is devoted to our results including a comparison\nwith multi-wavelength data (Section 4.1), estimates of the thermal fraction of the radio\ncontinuum emission (Section 4.2), an estimation of the magnetic field strength in NGC 4214\n(Section 4.3), an analysis of the importance of the magnetic field in the ISM of NGC 4214\n(Section 4.4), an investigation of the magnetic field structure of NGC 4214 (Section 4.5),\nestimates of cosmic ray lifetimes in NGC 4214 (Section 4.6), and a discussion of possible\nmechanisms for generating the field (Section 4.7). Finally, we summarize our conclusions in\nSection 5.\n\n2.\n\nData\n\nWe have obtained radio continuum polarization observations of NGC 4214 at 20, 6, and\n3 cm using the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA).3\nOur observations (proposal IDs: AK606, AK616; PI: Kepley) were taken between 2005\nAugust and 2005 December. See Table 1 for a summary of these observations. We used two\ndifferent configurations of the VLA to as closely as possibly match the synthesized beams at\nour three different observing frequencies. The correlator was configured for two intermediate\nfrequencies (IFs) each with 50 MHz bandwidth and full polarization products (RR, LL,\nRL, LR). For all our observations, we used 1331+305 (3C286) to calibrate the flux density\nscale and absolute polarization angle and the relevant secondary calibrator to calibrate the\namplitudes and phases as well as the instrumental polarization.\nFor our 20 cm observations, we observed our secondary calibrator (1227+365) for four\nminutes for every thirty-five minutes on source. The primary calibrator (1331+305) was\nobserved for ten minutes near the beginning of the observations and ten minutes at the end\nof the observations. For our 6 cm observations, we observed each pointing of a four pointing\nmosaic for eight minutes and observed the secondary calibrator for four minutes once every\ncycle through the mosaic. The primary calibrator was observed in a fashion similar to\nthat of our 20 cm observations. For our 3 cm observations, we observed each pointing of a\nsixteen pointing mosaic for six minutes. Every half cycle through the mosaic we observed\nour secondary calibrator (1146+399) for six minutes. The primary calibrator observations\n3\n\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National Science Foundation operated\nunder cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nwere the same as in our 20 cm and 6 cm observations.\nWe calibrated the data in AIPS. Our data reduction procedures followed the standard\nprocedures to calibrate VLA data outlined in the AIPS Cookbook (Greisen 2008) with some\nadditional effort to properly calibrate the polarization. We briefly sketch our data reduction\nprocedures below.\nAfter the initial flagging of the data, we used the primary calibrator (with the appropriate u-v limits) to set the primary flux density scale. With our observational setup, 3C286\n(1331+305) is well-approximated as a point source. We then calibrated the amplitudes and\nphases of the primary and secondary calibrators. The flux density value for the secondary\ncalibrator was bootstrapped from the flux density value obtained for the primary calibrator. We applied the calibrated amplitudes and phases to their respective calibrators and\nthe calibrated amplitudes and phases from the secondary calibrator to the source. To calibrate the instrumental polarization response, we used our observations of the secondary\ncalibrator. The secondary calibrator was observed at least five times over at least 100 degrees of parallactic angle, which allows us to use the rotation of the feed with respect to\nthe sky to separate the instrumental polarization (which does not rotate as the parallactic\nangle changes) from the astronomical polarization (which does rotate as the parallactic angle\nchanges). The calibration for the instrumental polarization was then applied to the data.\nThe primary calibrator was used to determine the absolute polarization angle and this final\ncorrection applied to the data.\nAfter calibrating in AIPS, we exported the I, Q, and U data as FITS files and imaged the\ndata in Miriad (Sault et al. 1995) to take advantage its ability to jointly deconvolve mosaics.\nFor the 3 cm and 6 cm data, we used the mosaic option on the invert task to combine the\ndifferent pointings of the mosiac. The data was weighted with a robust value of 0. For\nthe 3 cm data, we tapered the data in the u-v plane to match the resolution of the data at\n20 cm and 6 cm. We then cleaned the mosaic using the task mossdi. Since the 20 cm data\nwas only a single pointing, we used invert without the mosaic option to image the data and\nthe task clean to clean the resulting image. In the 20 cm data, there was a bright source\nto the southwest of the galaxy that we were not able to completely model during cleaning.\nThe incomplete removal of the source has the side-effect of increasing the noise in the 20 cm\nStokes I image to approximately 4 times the theoretical noise at 20 cm and twice the noise\nin the other images. The Stokes Q and U images were not affected as severely and their\nnoise levels are much closer to the theoretical noise. Table 2 summarizes the properties of\nour final images.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n3.\n\nProperties of the Radio Continuum Emission\n3.1.\n\nTotal Intensity\n\nFigure 1 shows the distribution of the radio continuum emission in NGC 4214. The\nemission is most extended at 20 cm despite the higher noise levels in the 20 cm image. At\n3 cm, the emission is largely confined to two regions near the center of the galaxy. The circles\nin the middle and right panels of Figure 1 show the largest angular scale imaged by the VLA\nat 6 cm and 3 cm. The largest angular scale imaged by the VLA at 20 cm is larger than the\nregion shown in Figure 1.\nWe recover most of the radio continuum flux from the galaxy. The first evidence in favor\nof this conclusion is that the extent of NGC 4214 at both 6 cm and 3 cm is much smaller than\nthe largest angular scale imaged at those wavelengths. The second line of evidence for this\nconclusion is shown in Figure 2. In this Figure, we plot the sum of the 3 cm radio continuum\nemission in a particular annulus as a function of radius from the center of the galaxy. The\npresence of a large negative bowl surrounding the radio continuum emission would indicate\nthat large-scale emission is being resolved out. This effect would be largest for the 3 cm data\nbecause it will resolve out emission on smaller scales than the 6 cm or 20 cm data. There\nis no significant negative bowl surrounding our 3 cm radio continuum emission. The dip at\n150\u2032\u2032 is well beyond the main body of radio continuum emission and is the same magnitude\nas the variations at larger radii. Finally, we have plotted the total flux from our data along\nwith measurements of the total flux from the literature in Figure 3. We assume that the\nerrors on our total fluxes and those of measurements from the literature without quoted\nerrors are 20%. This error reflects the fundamental uncertainty in the calibration of radio\nfluxes. Table 3 lists the values and their sources. Our measured radio continuum fluxes are\nlarger than the previously measured radio continuum fluxes. Therefore, we are not resolving\nout significant emission on scales larger than our largest angular scale. Our measured fluxes\nare larger than the fluxes from previous observations because all of the previous observations\nwere shallow survey observations and these observations are able to detect more faint diffuse\nemission.\nGiven the systematic offset between the archival measurements and our data, the heterogeneity of the archival measurements, and the limited number of measurements from our\nobservations, we only fit a simple model consisting of a single power law to our radio continuum spectrum for NGC 4214. We find that the data can be fit by a single power law with a\nspectral index4 equal to \u22120.43 \u00b1 0.06. This spectral index shows that the spectrum includes\n4\n\nWe define the spectral index, \u03b1, as S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 .\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\na mix of thermal and non-thermal emission. We see some hint that the spectrum is convex,\nwhich would suggest that models including free-free absorption of synchrotron and/or freefree emission or including synchrotron losses might be appropriate (Deeg et al. 1993). The\nelectron densities measured in NGC 4214 by Kobulnicky & Skillman (1996) are similar to\nthe electron densities determined by the modeling of the radio continuum spectra of other\nsimilar galaxies including free-free absorption of synchrotron emission by Deeg et al. (1993).\nHowever, our limited data set does not justify the use of more complex models. Additional\ndata points at higher and lower frequencies determined using data that matches the spatial frequency range and sensitivity of our data are necessary to model these more complex\nphysical scenarios.\nThere are two isolated regions of radio continuum emission located to the north and\nnortheast of the main emission region. The first is a region of diffuse 20 cm emission to the\nnorth of the galaxy at (12h 15m 38s , 36\u25e622\u2032 30\u2032\u2032 ), referred to hereafter as the diffuse synchrotron\nregion. This region is likely to be part of NGC 4214 based on the presence of the optical and\nH\u03b1 emission in the same location (see \u00a74.1 for further discussion). The bright radio continuum source with a steep radio continuum spectrum (see \u00a7 3.2) at (12h 15m 48.9s , 36\u25e6 21\u203254.10\u2032\u2032 )\nis resolved into two sources by the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters\n(FIRST) survey (Becker et al. 1995). McMahon et al. (2002) is able to identify an optical counterpart for this source on the red POSS-I plates; the optical morphology is classified as blended (two local maxima with a single set of connected above-threshold pixels). Unfortunately, there are no determinations of the source redshift. The southernmost of the two FIRST sources is coincident with x-ray point source 20 from Hartwell et al.\n(2004). The x-ray emission from this source is extremely hard ((H \u2212 M)/(H + M) = 0.698,\n(M \u2212S)/(M +S) = 0.231). Based on the steep spectra index in the radio, the blended source\nidentification of McMahon et al. (2002), and the hard x-ray colors from the associated x-ray\nsource, we conclude that this source is a background AGN.\n\n3.2.\n\nSpectral Indices\n\nThe spectral indices between the 20 cm and the 6 cm data and the 6 cm and the 3 cm\ndata are shown in Figure 4. Regions in the input images below 3\u03c3 were masked prior to\ncalculating the spectral index. Thermal emission has a spectral index of -0.1 and synchrotron\nemission has a spectral index of \u223c \u22120.7, although free-free absorption and synchrotron\nlosses can modify the observed spectrum. The two brightest emission peaks are thermally\ndominated with the younger (2.5 to 3.0 Myr; MacKenty et al. 2000), southern peak (NGC\n4214-II) having a flatter spectral index than the older (3.0 to 4.0 Myr; MacKenty et al.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n2000), northern peak (NGC 4214-I). Flat radio continuum spectra like those seen in NGC\n4214-I and NGC 4214-II are characteristic of dwarf starburst galaxies (Klein et al. 1984;\nDeeg et al. 1993). The two fainter sources northwest of the galaxy (at 12h15m 34s , 36\u25e6 20\u2032 )\nare also thermally dominated, but with a less steep spectrum than NGC 4214-I and NGC\n4214-II. The regions between NGC 4214-I and -II and the peaks to the northwest have steeper\nspectra showing that synchrotron emission plays a more important role in these regions.\n\n3.3.\n\nPolarized Emission\n\nSince we were interested in investigating the structure of the magnetic field, we determined the polarized intensity and the polarization angle from the Stokes Q and U images.\nThe derived polarized intensities were corrected for the bias in the estimated polarized intensity (Simmons & Stewart 1985; Vaillancourt 2006).\nThe percent polarization gives the strength of the uniform field relative to that of the total field, while the polarization angle rotated by \u223c 90\u25e6 gives the orientation of the magnetic\nfield. The polarized emission of NGC 4214 is shown in Figure 5. There is little polarized emission associated with NGC 4214. This lack of polarization could be due to several\ninstrumental/imaging effects or due to depolarization effects internal to the galaxy. The possible instrumental imaging effects are: 1) depolarization due to mosaicing, 2) the polarized\nemission is stronger at lower resolutions, or 3) bandwidth depolarization due to combining\ntwo IFs. To check that mosaicing the observations has not depolarized the final image or\nproduced spurious polarization signatures, we imaged each pointing separately at 6 cm and\n3 cm. The images of each pointing at both frequencies were largely depolarized, so mosaicing\nwas not the cause of the depolarization seen in Figure 5. To see what effect decreasing the\nresolution of the images had we made images with 1.5 times and 2.0 times the resolution\nof the VLA images and an image with the resolution of a 100-m single dish telescope (e.g.,\nthe Effelsberg 100-m telescope or the Green Bank Telescope). Decreasing the resolution\ndid not increase the amount of visible polarization, so the resolution of these images was\nnot the cause of the depolarization. To see if bandwidth depolarization is the cause of the\ndepolarization, we imaged each IF separately and compared their polarized emission and determined that there was no significant depolarization associated with combining the two IFs\nfor imaging. Based on these experiments it does not seem likely that instrumental/imaging\neffects are the cause of the depolarization.\nThe lack of polarization in Figure 5 could also be due to the properties of the galaxy\nitself including depolarization effects internal to the galaxy or insufficient sensitivity. Depolarization effects internal to the galaxy, e.g., Sokoloff et al. (1998), decrease as ones goes to\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nshorter wavelengths. Therefore, the image at 3 cm should be largely free of depolarization\neffects while still having appreciable synchrotron emission (see Sections 3.1 and 4.3). The\n3 cm polarization image does not show appreciably more polarization than the 20 cm polarization image, so internal depolarization effects do not seem to be leading to depolarization\nat 20 cm and 6 cm. In Section 4.5.1, we use our polarization data to constrain the uniform\nmagnetic field strength.\n\n3.4.\n\nComparison with Previous Observations\n\nOur data represent the first observations of the polarized radio continuum emission from\nNGC 4214. There are, however, three previous studies of the radio continuum emission of\nNGC 4214: Allsopp (1979), Beck et al. (2000), and MacKenty et al. (2000).\nThe earliest interferometric observations of the radio continuum emission from NGC\n4214 were done at 20 cm by Allsopp (1979). Despite their much larger beam (58\u2032\u2032 by 96\u2032\u2032 )\nand higher noise levels, the image derived from these observations has the same overall\nshape as our higher resolution and better sensitivity image. The emission to the southeast\nat 12h 15m 34s , 36\u25e6 20\u2032 that they suggest is a background object is actually clearly part of the\nmain radio continuum distribution in our higher resolution observations and is associated\nwith faint H\u03b1 and optical emission.\nBeck et al. (2000) observed NGC 4214 with the VLA at 20 cm, 6 cm, 3.6 cm, and 2 cm\nwith a resolution of \u223c 2\u2032\u2032 . By optimizing their observations for higher resolution, however,\nthey resolve out most of the extended structure seen in Figure 1. Beck et al. (2000), however,\nare able to resolve NGC 4214-I and NGC 4214-II into several point sources with hints of\nmore extended emission, particularly in NGC 4214-I. They find that the spectral indices\nthat they derive between 6 cm and 2 cm are rising, i.e., positive, and attribute this to the\nfree-free emission becoming optically thick. They estimate that the turnover frequency for\nNGC 4214 is closer to 15 GHz than to 5 GHz. We do not identify any rising spectrum\nsources between 6 and 3 cm. The beam of our lower resolution observations includes both\noptically thick sources and extended emission so we would not expect to be able to identify\nindividual optically thick sources.\nThe 20 cm and 6 cm radio continuum observations in MacKenty et al. (2000) are lower\nresolution (\u223c 4\u2032\u2032 ) than those in Beck et al. (2000), but still higher resolution than our observations. Again, the higher resolution of these observations compared to ours allows them\nto resolve NGC 4214-I and NGC 4214-II into several point sources with hints of extended\nemission, but resolves out much of the diffuse emission. MacKenty et al. (2000) were able\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nto identify one of the points sources in NGC 4214-I as a supernova remnant based on its\nspectral index and the properties of the associated optical emission, showing that supernovae\nhave had enough time to produce appreciable synchrotron radiation in NGC 4214.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nComparison of the Radio Continuum Emission with Emission at Other\nWavelengths\n\nIn Figures 6, 7, and 8, we compare the distribution of the radio continuum emission\nfrom NGC 4214 with the distribution of its optical and H\u03b1 emission. Figure 6 is a three-color\nimage relating the H\u03b1 (red), optical U band (blue), and optical V band (green) to the 20 cm\nradio continuum emission. In Figures 7 and 8, we provide more detailed comparisons of the\n20 cm, 6 cm, and 3 cm emission with the H\u03b1 and optical V band, respectively.\nFrom Figure 7, we can see that the radio continuum at 3 cm closely follows the distribution of the H\u03b1 emission. This correspondence shows that the 3 cm radio continuum\nemission has a large contribution from thermal emission. As the wavelength of our observations increases, we see more diffuse radio continuum emission. In the northern half of the\ngalaxy, there is diffuse emission that corresponds to the faint H\u03b1 filaments at 12h 15m 37s ,\n36\u25e6 20\u2032 45\u2032\u2032 . In the south, there is some diffuse emission that does not closely follow the H\u03b1\ndistribution at 12h 15m 45s , 36\u25e6 18\u2032 00\u2032\u2032 and 12h 15m 47s , 36\u25e6 18\u2032 45\u2032\u2032 ; these regions have a large\ncontribution from synchrotron emission. The western tip of the diffuse synchrotron region\n(12h 15m 38s , 36\u25e6 22\u203230\u2032\u2032 ) is associated with H\u03b1 emission and some faint 6 and 3 cm emission.\nThis part of the region is likely dominated by thermal emission. The remainder of the diffuse synchrotron region does not have any corresponding H\u03b1 emission or any appreciable\nemission at 3 or 6 cm, showing that is it dominated by non-thermal emission.\nFigure 8 shows that the radio continuum emission is confined to the central regions of\nthis galaxy. We see that the radio continuum emission, the H\u03b1 emission, and the stellar\nemission are all coincident in a bar-shaped region at the center of the galaxy. The diffuse\nsynchrotron region (12h 15m 38s , 36\u25e6 22\u2032 30\u2032\u2032 ) has stars associated with it. This correlation leads\nus to believe that this feature is an older star formation region. The noticeably resolved,\noptical object in the center of the region is green in Figure 6, which implies its emission is\ndominated by optical V band emission and thus belongs to an older stellar population. The\nexpected lifetime for the free-free emission is about 10 Myr (approximately the lifetime of\nthe most massive stars). The synchrotron emission lifetime is set by the confinement time\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nfor cosmic rays, i.e., the time it takes for cosmic rays to diffuse out of a galaxy.5 For our\nGalaxy, this timescale is on the order of 10 Myr. In Section 4.6, we estimate that this time\nscale is also approximately 10 Myr for NGC 4214 (although see the cavaets discussed in\nSection 4.6). There is a delay expected between the synchrotron emission and the free-free\nemission since the first supernovae do not appear until 3.5 Myr after the initial burst of star\nformation. This argument suggests that there can be synchrotron emission in a region after\nthe free-free emission has dissipated. Note that in this picture, we are assuming that the\ncosmic rays have not diffused very far from their sources on timescales of 10 Myr.\nThe timescales for free-free and synchrotron emission allow us to estimate the age of\nthe star formation episode that formed the diffuse synchrotron region. The eastern half of\nthe region has formed stars greater than 10 Myr ago so the free-free emission has dissipated,\nbut less than 13.5 Myr ago, so the cosmic rays are still confined to the galaxy and producing\nsynchrotron emission. The western half has formed stars within 10 Myr and thus still has\nboth synchrotron and free-free emission. The lack of emission in diffuse synchrotron region\nat 6 and 3 cm is due to the decrease in synchrotron intensity as the wavelength decreases\n(i.e., as the frequency increases). Assuming a spectral index of \u20130.7 and using the intensity\nof the diffuse synchrotron emission at 20 cm, the synchrotron emission from this patch would\nbe below the 3\u03c3 detection limit at 6 cm.\n\n4.2.\n\nFraction of Thermal Emission\n\nTo determine the magnetic field strength, we need to determine how much of the radio\ncontinuum emission is due to non-thermal (synchrotron) emission and how much is due to\nthermal (bremsstrahlung) emission. Since the electrons that produce the thermal emission\nin the radio are the same electrons that produce H\u03b1 in the optical, we use a flux calibrated\nH\u03b1 image kindly provided by D. Hunter (Hunter & Elmegreen 2004) to estimate the thermal\ncontribution to the radio emission. We use the approximate expression derived by Hunt et al.\n(2004) to convert the H\u03b1 fluxes to radio continuum fluxes\n\u0012\n\nf\u03bd\nmJy\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u00130.617 \u0010\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn(He+ )\nT\nfH\u03b1\n\u03bd \u0011\u22120.1\n= 1.16 1 +\nn(H + )\n104 K\nGHz\n10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121\n\n(1)\n\nwhere f\u03bd is the radio continuum flux, n(He+ )/n(H + ) is the ratio of ionized helium to ionized\nhydrogen, T is the temperature of the region, \u03bd is the frequency of the radio continuum\n5\n\nSmall distortions in the galactic magnetic field randomly scatter cosmic rays. See Dogiel & Breitschwerdt\n(2009) for a review of the relevant physics.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nobservations, and fH\u03b1 is the H\u03b1 flux. These expressions are valid for temperatures between\n10,000 K and 20,000 K and densities between 100 cm\u22123 and 1000 cm\u22123 . We use a value\nof 0.086 for n(He+ )/n(H + ) and a temperature of 10,000 K (Kobulnicky & Skillman 1996).\nThe synchrotron flux is then\n\u0012\n\u0013\nFth\nFnth = Ftot 1 \u2212\n(2)\nFtot\nwhere Fnth is the flux of the synchrotron (non-thermal) emission, Ftot is the total flux observed, and Fth is the thermal flux calculated using Equation (1). Any values of Fth /Ftot\ngreater than one or below zero are set to one and zero, respectively. In practice, this affects\nonly a few edge pixels.\nWe correct the H\u03b1 flux for foreground extinction using the value derived from the maps\nof Schlegel et al. (1998): AR \u223c AH\u03b1 \u223c 0.058. We do not correct for the internal extinction of\nNGC 4214, which varies as a function of position in the galaxy (Maiz-Apellaniz et al. 1998).\nLisenfeld et al. (2008) find that the internal extinction of NGC 4214 for H\u03b1 is between 0.3\nand 0.7 magnitudes. The values of high internal extinction in this galaxy are slightly offset\nfrom the peaks in the H\u03b1 emission. Due to our low resolution (\u223c 14\u2032\u2032 ), both the peaks of\nthermal radio/H\u03b1 emission and the regions of high extinction fall within the same beam.\nNot correcting for the effect of internal extinction could us to underestimate the flux of the\nfree-free emission by a factor of 1.3 to 1.9 and thus to overestimate the synchrotron flux\nby factors of 1.25 to 2 for regions that have 0.3 magnitudes of extinction and by factors\n2 to 3 for regions that have 0.7 magnitudes of extinction. The lower limits in both cases\nrefer to the flux peaks. Given the value of \u03b1 used in our calculation of the magnetic field\n(see Section 4.3 for details), this will change our magnetic field estimate by 9 to 40%, with\nthe mean change closer to 9%. Correcting the free-free emission also has an effect on the\nmeasured polarization of the emission. If the H\u03b1 data is not corrected for extinction, the\nflux of the free-free emission will be an underestimate, so the intensity of the synchrotron\nwill be an overestimate. Then the percent polarization of the synchrotron emission, which\nis related to the ratio of the uniform field to the random field, will be an underestimate.\nOur thermal flux estimates as a function of position in NGC 4214 are shown in Figure 9.\n\n4.3.\n\nMagnetic Field Strength\n\nWe can calculate the magnetic field strength using the estimated synchrotron flux from\nSection 4.2. We use the revised equipartition estimate of the magnetic field strength given\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nin Beck & Krause (2005)\n4\u03c0(1 \u2212 2\u03b1)(K0 + 1)I\u03bd Ep1+2\u03b1 (\u03bd/2c1 )\u2212\u03b1\nBt =\n(\u22122\u03b1 \u2212 1)c2 (\u03b1)lc4\n\u0014\n\n\u00151/(3\u2212\u03b1)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Bt is the total equipartition magnetic field in G, \u03b1 is the spectral index of the emission6 ,\nK0 is the number density ratio of the protons to the electrons, Ep is the rest energy of the\nproton, c1 is a constant equal to 6.26428 \u00d7 1018 erg\u22122 s\u22121 G\u22121 , c2 is a constant tabulated\non page 232 of Pacholczyk (1970) as c5 , l is the line of sight through the galaxy, and c4\nis a function correcting for the inclination of the region with respect to the sky. Since our\npolarization observations shown in Section 3.3 do not reveal a large-scale uniform field, we\nuse the version of c4 for the case of a completely random, isotropic field\n\u0012 \u0013(1\u2212\u03b1)/2\n2\nc4 =\n.\n(4)\n3\nIn this case, c4 does not explicitly depend on the inclination, but instead represents an\naverage over all possible orientations for the random field.\nWe need to carefully consider which frequency has the best estimate of the synchrotron\nflux. In Section 3.1, we see hints that the radio continuum spectrum of NGC 4214 may\nbe affected by either free-free absorption of synchrotron emission and/or synchrotron losses,\nalthough we do not have adequate data at higher and lower frequencies to constrain either\nmodel. Free-free absorption of synchrotron emission would cause the 20 cm synchrotron flux\nto be underestimated. Cosmic rays also lose energy via synchrotron emission if they are not\nreaccelerated. This effects the higher energy cosmic rays more than the lower energy cosmic\nrays and would thus cause the 3 cm synchrotron flux to be underestimated. Therefore, the\n6 cm image represents the best wavelength for us to determine the magnetic field strength of\nNGC 4214. We use a typical value for \u03b1 of \u20130.7. Given the uncertainties in the mechanisms\nresponsible for shaping the radio continuum spectrum of NGC 4214, it is better to use a\ntypical value than a value derived from the data. We note that the spectral index between\nthe 20 cm and 3 cm synchrotron fluxes for our data is \u20130.6, which is very close to the typical\nvalue.\nWe can use the following expression from Ott et al. (2001) to estimate the scale height\nof NGC 4214's disk from neutral hydrogen observations and obtain the line of sight distance\nthrough NGC 4214's disk\n\u0010 \u03c3\n\u00112 \u0012 N \u0013\u22121 \u0012 \u03c1 \u0013\ngas\nHI\nHI\n21\nh [pc] = 5.79 \u00d7 10\n(5)\nkm s\u22121\ncm\u22122\n\u03c1tot\n6\n\nWe use the opposite sign convention for \u03b1 as Beck & Krause (2005).\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nwhere h is the scale height, \u03c3gas is the velocity dispersion of the neutral gas, NHI is the\ncolumn density of the neutral gas, and \u03c1HI /\u03c1tot is the ratio of the density of neutral gas to\nthe total density. From Allsopp (1979), we know that MHI /Mtot is 0.3, so since MHI /Mtot \u223c\n\u03c1HI /\u03c1tot = 0.3. Allsopp (1979) also gives us a column density for the neutral gas of 8 \u00d7\n1020 cm\u22122 and a velocity dispersion of 10 km s\u22121 . These values give a scale height for this\ndisk of 200 pc, which agrees with the estimate of the disk scale height by Ma\u0131\u0301z-Apell\u00e1niz et al.\n(1999). Given the uncertain but close to face-on inclination of NGC 4214 we take i = 30\u25e6 .\nThe scale height of the magnetic field may be larger than the scale height of the HI. In the\nMilky Way, the scale height of the HI is 1.6 kpc (Marasco & Fraternali 2011), while the scale\nheight of the synchrotron emission is 4.6 kpc at the solar circle (Ferri\u00e8re 2001). Unfortunately,\nthe face-on orientation of NGC 4214 and the lack of information about its overall field\ntopology prevent us from determining the scale height of the synchrotron emission from first\nprinciples. We can estimate the effect of a much larger magnetic field scale height on the\nmagnetic field strength estimates for NGC 4214 using the difference between the Milky Way\nHI and synchrotron scale height and Equation (3). If the synchrotron scale height of NGC\n4214 is three times larger than the HI scale height, then the magnetic field strength estimate\nabove will be 1.3 times bigger than the actual magnetic field strength.\nOur estimate of the magnetic field strength in NGC 4214 is given in Figure 10. The\nmagnetic field strength peaks near the center of the galaxy with a value of 30 \u03bcG and\ndecreases to a value of 10 \u03bcG at the edge of the galaxy. To get an idea of the uncertainties\nin these estimates, we have varied K0 to 40, \u03b1 by 0.1, changed the estimated synchrotron\nemission by a factor of 2, changed the line of sight distance through the galaxy by 20%, and\nchanged the distance by 20%. With these uncertainities in the initial parameters, we get\nan uncertainty for the central magnetic field strength of 9.5 \u03bcG and an uncertainty for the\nmagnetic field strength on the edges of 3 \u03bcG.\n\n4.4.\n\nImportance of the Magnetic Field in the ISM of NGC 4214\n\nTo determine the relative importance of the magnetic field in the larger context of\nthe interstellar medium of NGC 4214, we calculate total magnetic pressure as well as the\nmagnetic pressure in the inner and outer regions of NGC 4214 and compared this pressure\nto the thermal pressure from the hot ionized gas, the thermal and turbulent pressure in HII\nregions, and the gravitational \"pressure\". These values, along with the values and equations\nused to calculate them, are given in Table 4.\nFrom these estimates, we can see that the total hot gas pressure, the total magnetic\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\npressure, and the gravitational \"pressure\" are the same order of magnitude, with the hot gas\nhaving the largest pressure and the magnetic field the lowest.7 The thermal and turbulent\npressures of the HII regions, however, dominate the pressure balance in the central star\nforming regions (although not the galaxy as a whole). Wilcots & Thurow (2001) found that\nthe energy in the ionized gas was comparable to that injected via stellar winds. The ISM\npressure balance of NGC 4214 is similar to that of NGC 1569 (Kepley et al. 2010); the\nturbulent and thermal pressures of the HII regions dominate the pressure balance of NGC\n1569 in the central star forming regions, while the magnetic field, hot gas, and gravity are\napproximately equal. Although the magnetic field strength in both galaxies is comparable\nto that of larger spiral galaxies, neither NGC 4214 nor NGC 1569 appear to be magnetically\noverpressured compared to their gravitational potential. The magnetic field of NGC 4214\nmay play a role in shaping any outflow of gas from this galaxy as in NGC 1569 (Kepley et al.\n2010), but given the orientation of NGC 4214, we are not able to determine this with our\nobservations (see Section 4.5.3).\n\n4.5.\n\nThe Structure of the Magnetic Field of NGC 4214\n4.5.1. Uniform Field Using Polarization Information\n\nUsing our data, we can calculate an upper limit on the uniform magnetic field strength\nin NGC 4214. One can approximate the percent polarization as\np=\n\n2\nBu,\u22a5\nP\n= p0 2\nI\nBt,\u22a5\n\n(6)\n\nwhere p is the percent polarization, P is the intensity of the polarized emission, I is total\nintensity of the synchrotron emission, p0 is the intrinsic polarization of synchrotron emission\n(\u223c 0.75), Bu,\u22a5 is the uniform magnetic field in the plane of the sky, and Bt,\u22a5 is the total\nmagnetic field in the plane of the sky (Burn 1966; Beck et al. 2003). For NGC 4214, we\ncalculated the total field in Section 4.3 assuming that the field was entirely random, so\nEquation (6) becomes\n2\nBu,\u22a5\np = p0 2 2 .\n(7)\nB\n3 t\nAssuming a value of 40% thermal emission at 6 cm (see Section 4.2), we would detect\nat the 3\u03c3 level 30% polarization at 12 times the noise level (third contour in Figure 5). In\n7\n\nSince the gravitational pressure was estimated using the Virial Theorem, it should only be compared to\nthe pressures for the entire system, not the pressures for individual regions.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nSection 4.3, we estimate the total magnetic field strength at the 3rd contour to be 15 \u03bcG.8\nUsing Equation (7), we then get an upper limit on the strength of the uniform component\nof the magnetic field in the plane of the sky of 8 \u03bcG. The large thermal component of the\nradio continuum emission of NGC 4214 reduces our sensitivity to the uniform field. If the\nradio continuum emission in NGC 4214 was all synchrotron, our upper limit on the uniform\nmagnetic field strength would be 6 \u03bcG.\nFrom this analysis, we conclude that we do not detect a uniform component of the\ndisk magnetic field of NGC 4214 greater than 8 \u03bcG on size scales larger than our resolution\n(200 pc). The disk of NGC 4214 may have a uniform field, but it would have to be weaker\nthan 8 \u03bcG. There could be structure in the magnetic field on size scales smaller than 200 pc,\nbut our observations cannot resolve these structures.\n\n4.5.2. Could the Shape of the Diffuse Synchrotron Region Be Due to a Uniform Field?\nAs a star-forming region ages, the relativistic electrons diffuse away from their birthplaces along magnetic field lines. In a completely random field, one would expect that the\nelectrons would diffuse outward isotropically. If there is a uniform component to the field,\nhowever, the relativistic electrons will preferentially diffuse along the field lines rather than\nacross them. The diffuse synchrotron region in NGC 4214 is elongated along a position angle\nof about 60 degrees, which suggests that there is a uniform magnetic field component in that\ndirection.\nWe can use the distance between the stars and the end of the region (490 pc) and the\nprobable age of the region (10 Myr) to estimate the speed at which the relativistic electrons\ndiffused. This gives a lower limit on the diffusion speed of 4.7 \u00d7 106 cm s\u22121 . Assuming that\nrelativistic electrons are moving at the Alfv\u00e9n speed (vA )\nvA2 =\n\nB2\n4\u03c0\u03c1\n\n(8)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, \u03c1 is the density, and all quantities are in cgs units, if\nwe have an estimate of the density in the region then we can get a lower limit for the strength\nof the magnetic field responsible for diffusing the cosmic rays. The speed of the cosmic rays is\ncoupled to the density of the thermal electrons, so we can use the H\u03b1 image described above\nto get an estimate of the density of the thermal electrons in the diffuse synchrotron region. In\nthe diffuse synchrotron region there is 4.11 \u00d7 10\u22126 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 sterad\u22121 of emission. From\n8\n\nRecall that this field strength was derived in Section 4.3 assuming that the field was entirely random.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nSpitzer (1978),\n\u0003\nEM pc cm\u22126 =\n\u0002\n\nR\n\nI\u03bd d\u03bd\u03bb\n2.46 \u00d7 1017 h c \u03b13,2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere EM is the emission measure, I\u03bd is the specific intensity, \u03b13,2 is the production coefficient\nfor the H\u03b1 line, and all values (unless noted) are in cgs. We use a value of \u03b13,2 of 11.7 \u00d710\u221214\nwhich is valid for 10,000 K. This gives us an emission measure for the region of 47 pc cm\u22126 .\nIf we assume that NGC 4214 is nearly face-on, we use the line of sight distance through the\ndisk derived in Section 4.3 to convert the emission measure to a number density of thermal\nelectrons. This calculation gives a number density for the electrons of 0.34 cm\u22123 . Assuming\nthat the ionized gas has the same number of electrons and protons gives a density for the\nionized gas of 5.7 \u00d7 10\u221225 g cm\u22123 . The lower limit on the total magnetic field strength can\nthen be derived using\np\nB = vA 4\u03c0\u03c1.\n(10)\n\nUsing our values of vA and \u03c1, the lower limit on the total magnetic field strength in the diffuse\nsynchrotron region is 13 \u03bcG. This field strength is the same as the field strength derived for\nthe diffuse region from the 20 cm data using the assumptions described in Section 4.3. At\n20 cm, we are sensitive to polarizations greater than 26% in the diffuse synchrotron region.\nUsing the magnetic field strength determined from the synchrotron emission (13 \u03bcG), we get\nan upper limit on the uniform field strength of 7.6 \u03bcG.\n\nWe can use the ratio of the length of the region to the width of the region to derive\nthe ratio of the uniform magnetic field strength (Bu ) to the random magnetic field strength\n(Br ) and compare it to the limits on Bu /Br from our data. Let us take y to be the direction\nalong the diffuse synchrotron region and x to be the direction across it, the equation of the\nmagnetic field to be B = \u0177By + x\u0302Bx , X to be half the total width of the region, and Y to be\nhalf the total length of the region. By and Bx are both constant in a correlation length l, but\nBx can be positive or negative. In this picture, By corresponds to the uniform component\nand Bx corresponds to the random component. Then the equation of a field line is\ndy\nBy\n.\n=\ndx\nBx\n\n(11)\n\nThe displacement in y when the field line has gone a distance l in x is\n\u2206y =\n\nlBy\n.\nBx\n\n(12)\n\nThe cosmic rays stream at the Alfv\u00e9n speed, so the time to travel the distance l is \u03c4 = l/vAx ,\nwhere vAx = Bx /(4\u03c0\u03c1)1/2 . After a time t, the cosmic rays have taken N = t/\u03c4 random\nsteps of length l in the x direction , so the rms displacement of the cosmic rays, X, is\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nlN 1/2 = (lvAx t)1/2 . The displacement in the y direction is just N\u2206y = NlBy /Bx . Then the\nelongation of the cloud is\n\u00131/2\n\u0012\nBy\nBy\nvAx t\nY\n= N 1/2 .\n(13)\n=\nX\nl\nBx\nBx\nWe can estimate N from the strength of the random field derived above from our data\n(12.9 \u03bcG), the density of the region (0.34 cm\u22123 ), the age of the region (10 Myr), and the outer\nlength scale for turbulence (90 pc in the LMC; Gaensler et al. 2005). This gives a value for\nN of approximately 6. The measured values of X and Y are 235 pc and 491 pc, respectively,\nwhich gives a value for Y /X of 2.1. With our estimate of N, the ratio By /Bx = Bu /Br is\n0.85. From our data, the ratio of Bu /Br allowed by our data is 0.69, which is close enough\nto the ratio estimated from the size of the region to make our scenario that the diffuse\nsynchrotron region is elongated by a uniform field plausible.\n\n4.5.3. Possible Structure in the Halo of NGC 4214\nThe analysis in Sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 only applies to the structure of the magnetic\nfield in the disk of NGC 4214. The nearly face-on orientation of NGC 4214 does not allow\nus to determine whether NGC 4214 has a uniform magnetic field oriented along a galactic\noutflow like that seen in NGC 1569 (Kepley et al. 2010). From estimates of the mechanical\nenergy in the wind (Lmech \u223c 1040 \u2212 1041 erg s\u22121 ), it appears that it is possible for NGC 4214\nto experience a blow-out (Ott et al. 2005b). Therefore, NGC 4214 might have magnetic field\nstructure perpendicular to its disk in its halo. Detection of this halo field may be possible\nusing the dense grid of background rotation measures produced by the Square Kilometer\nArray (Beck & Gaensler 2004).\nWe would like to note that while in principle the rotation measure of the background\nsource to the northeast of the main body of emission could be used to estimate the magnetic\nfield direction and strength along the line of sight, i.e., through the disk, unfortunately there\nis no H\u03b1 emission in the region of the galaxy associated with the background source, so\nwe would be unable to determine a field strength. In addition, there are no other nearby\nbackground sources to allow us to estimate an average rotation measure for background\nsources in that region of the sky.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n4.6.\n\nCosmic Ray Lifetimes\n\nUsing the arguments from Section 4.5.2, we can also estimate a timescale for cosmic ray\nconfinement in NGC 4214. Assuming that a supernova goes off at the midplane of the disk,\nthe cosmic rays would have to travel 200 pc to to escape the disk. Since cosmic rays diffuse\nat the Alfv\u00e9n velocity, the total displacement of the cosmic rays, L, in a time t is\nL = (lvA t)1/2 =\n\n(lBt)1/2\n.\n(4\u03c0\u03c1)1/4\n\n(14)\n\nThe timescale for the cosmic rays to escape the disk is then\nX 2 (4\u03c0ne mH )1/2\n,\n(15)\nlB\nwhere ne is the number density of electrons and mH is the mass of a hydrogen atom. We\nestimate ne to be 1 cm\u22123 , B to be 20 \u03bcG, and take l to be the outer length scale of\nthe turbulence, which Gaensler et al. (2005) found to be 90 pc in the LMC. Using these\nparameters, the timescale for the diffusion of cosmic rays out of the disk of NGC 4214 is\napproximately 10 Myr \u2013 comparable to the diffusion time in the Milky Way. If the scale\nheight of the synchrotron emission is much larger, as discussed at the end of Section 4.3,\nthis timescale could be as long as 67 Myr. NGC 4214 may have a wind in its central portion\nOtt et al. (2005b) which would shorten the cosmic ray confinement time (Everett et al. 2008,\n2010). Detailed modeling of the effect of a central wind on the cosmic ray confinement time\nin NGC 4214 is beyond the scope of the paper.\nt=\n\nSynchrotron losses will further limit the lifetime of synchrotron emission. To see if the\nsynchrotron loss timescale will dominate over the cosmic ray confinement time, we calculate\nthe lifetime of cosmic ray electrons due to synchrotron losses. The power P in erg s\u22121\nradiated by synchrotron emission is\n4\nB2\nP = \u03c3T c\u03b2 2 \u03b3 2\n3\n8\u03c0\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03c3T is the Thomson cross-section, c is the speed of light, \u03b2 is v/c, and \u03b3 is (1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )\u22121/2 .\nSince cosmic rays are traveling very close to the speed of light, we can assume \u03b2 \u2248 1.\nAssuming that all the emission is produced at the critical frequency\n\u03bdc =\n\n3 2 qB\n\u03b3\nsin \u03b1\n4\u03c0 mc\n\n(17)\n\nand using the relation E = \u03b3mc2 , we find that the energy of the electron at the critical\nfrequency is\n\u00131/2\n\u0012\n4\u03c0m3e c5 \u03bdc\n(18)\nE=\n3qB\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nwhere the factor of sin \u03b1 has been ignored since it is a factor on the order of one. Dividing the\nresult of Equation (18) by Equation (16) gives an estimate for the synchrotron loss timescale.\nFor emission at 20 cm (1.4 GHz) and a magnetic field strength of 10 \u03bcG (the field strength\nin the diffuse synchrotron region), the synchrotron loss timescale for a cosmic ray electron\nis 44 Myr. At 6 cm (8.5 GHz), the lifetime of the cosmic rays due to synchrotron losses is\nshorter \u2013 18 Myr. Therefore, at 20 cm in the diffuse synchrotron region, the confinement\ntime is shorter than the synchrotron loss timescale and thus the confinement time dominates.\n(Although if the synchrotron scale height is 600 pc rather than 200 pc, the synchrotron loss\ntime will dominate.) At lower frequencies and larger magnetic fields, the synchrotron loss\ntime scale decreases so that in the center of the galaxy with a magnetic field of 30 \u03bcG and\nat 3 cm, the synchrotron loss timescale may be as short at 6 Myr.\n\n4.7.\n\nGenerating the Magnetic Field\n\nTo evaluate the possibility of an \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c9 dynamo operating in NGC 4214, we compare\nthe shear and turbulence in NGC 4214 to that of a larger galaxy, where an \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c9 dynamo\nmay be operating: the Milky Way.\nFirst, we evaluate the effect of differential rotation by calculating the shear in both\nsystems. Shear is defined as d\u03a9/dr, which for a flat rotation curve is just v/r 2 . At the solar\nradius (8 kpc), the rotation speed is 220 km s\u22121 , so the shear in the Milky Way is about\n3.4 km s\u22121 kpc\u22122 . In Figure 11, we show the absolute value of the shear in NGC 4214 as a\nfunction of radius. To calculate the shear, we used the neutral hydrogen rotation curve for\nNGC 4214 given in Allsopp (1979), corrected for the distance and inclination used in this\npaper. The shear in NGC 4214 varies significantly below a radius of 2 kpc, but the average\nvalue at these radii is close to the Milky Way value. At a radius of 2 kpc, the shear begins\nto increase, reaching a maximum of 12 km s\u22121 kpc\u22122 at a radius of about 3 kpc. The shear\nthen begins to decrease and by 5 kpc is at or below the shear estimated at the solar radius in\nthe Milky Way. We would note that the diffuse synchrotron region discussed in Section 4.5.2\nis located in the region of maximum shear about 2.5 kpc from the center of NGC 4214.\nAccording to Rayleigh's Criterion, the quantity \u03a9r 2 must increase as a function of r for\na rotation curve to be stable. This is satisfied for the \u03a9 shown in Figure 11 everywhere\nexcept in 3 kpc < r < 5.5 kpc, but the observational uncertainties are large enough that the\ndeparture from stability, which is slight, is most likely due to error.\nTo evaluate the turbulent component of the dynamo process, we assume that the turbulence in these galaxies is generated by supernovae and use the supernova rate as a proxy for\nturbulence. In the Milky Way, the supernova rate from type II supernovae is 27 Myr\u22121 kpc\u22122\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n(Ferri\u00e8re 2001). For NGC 4214, we can determine the supernova rate from the star formation\nrate. Hunter & Elmegreen (2004) determine a star formation rate per unit area for NGC\n4214 of 5.0 \u00d7 103 M\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 . Assuming a Salpeter IMF, that the range of masses for\nstars is 0.8 M\u2299 to 150 M\u2299 , and that only stars above 8 M\u2299 become Type II supernovae, we\nobtain a rate for the formation of stars greater than 8 M\u2299 of 85 Myr\u22121 kpc\u22122 . Assuming\na massive star lifetime of 30 Myr and that the burst of star formation in NGC 4214 began\n4 Myr ago (MacKenty et al. 2000), that gives a supernova rate of 11.3 Myr\u22121 kpc\u22122 .\nComparing the shear and the supernova rates between the Milky Way and NGC 4214,\nwe see that NGC 4214 has a similar level of shear, but a lower supernova rate by a factor of\n2. This rough calculation may indicate that additional turbulence needs to be injected by\nsupernovae in order to provide the turbulence necessary for the shear to generate a largescale field. Given that the episode of star formation in NGC 4214 started relatively recently\nand that it seems to be continuously producing stars, we anticipate that supernovae will be\nable to generate additional turbulence as the galaxy ages. In shear-dominated turbulence,\none expects that the field would be oriented (although not necessarily directed) azimuthally.\nThe region of diffuse synchrotron emission is located near the shear maximum in NGC\n4214, which suggests that the magnetic field in this region is oriented by the shear, but not\nnecessarily directed as it would be in a large scale dynamo.\nAmplification by an \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c9 mechanism is rather slow, so various authors (e.g. Parker\n1992) have proposed mechanisms to decrease the time needed to amplify the field. If a largescale field could be generated for NGC 4214 using a faster dynamo like the one proposed for\nNGC 4449 (Otmianowska-Mazur et al. 2000), it may have not had time to develop yet or\nit may have been disrupted by recent star formation. Note that we cannot probe magnetic\nfield structure on size scales less than 200 pc due to the resolution of our observations.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper, we have presented the deepest radio continuum polarization images of\nthe irregular galaxy NGC 4214 to date. Below we summarize the overall conclusions of our\nwork.\nThe global radio continuum spectrum for NGC 4214 is convex, which suggests that either\nfree-free absorption of synchrotron emission and/or free-free emission or synchrotron losses\nare occurring. We fit the global radio continuum spectrum of NGC 4214 with a single power\nlaw with a spectral index of \u20130.43 because of the offsets between our data and the archival\ndata, the limited wavelength coverage of our data, and the heterogenity of the archival data.\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nThis spectral index indicates that the radio continuum emission in NGC 4214 is a mix of\nthermal and non-thermal emission. The spectral indices of the radio continuum peaks are\nflat, with the younger region (NGC 4214-II) having the flatter spectral index. Between the\nradio continuum peaks, the spectral indices are steeper, showing that synchrotron emission\nplays a more important role there. We do not detect any significant polarized emission in\nNGC 4214 at size scales greater than 200 pc and conclude that this is due to the intrinsic\nnature of the galaxy rather than instrumental/imaging effects or internal depolarization.\nWe find that the radio continuum emission at 3 cm is correlated with the H\u03b1 emission\nfrom this galaxy, while the radio continuum emission at 20 cm is more extended. The central\nregions of NGC 4214 are approximately 50% thermal at 3 cm. North of the main body of\nradio continuum emission, we detect a region of diffuse synchrotron radiation associated\nwith a group of stars in NGC 4214 and speculate that this region is a relic of previous star\nformation. Based the relative timescales of free-free and synchrotron emission, we estimate\nan age for this region of between 10 and 13.5 Myr.\nWe estimate the fraction of thermal radio continuum emission in NGC 4214 using H\u03b1\nimages. Using this estimate, we calculate the estimated intensity of the synchrotron radiation\nto estimate the magnetic field strength of NGC 4214. The field strength reaches a maximum\nof 30\u00b19.5 \u03bcG in the center of the galaxy and tapers off to 10\u00b13 \u03bcG at the edges. Comparing\nthe pressures of the various components of the ISM of NGC 4214, we find that the hot\ngas pressure, the magnetic pressure, and the gravitational \"pressure\" all the same order of\nmagnitude. In the central star forming regions of NGC 4214, the thermal and turbulent\npressure of the HII regions dominate the pressure balance of this galaxy. The pressure\nbalance in NGC 4214 is similar to that of another irregular galaxy: NGC 1569. In both\ngalaxies, star formation plays the dominant role in shaping the ISM. Although the magnetic\nfield strength in both galaxies is comparable to that of larger spiral galaxies, neither NGC\n4214 nor NGC 1569 appear to be magnetically overpressured compared to their gravitational\npotential.\nUsing our polarization data, we place an upper limit on the uniform magnetic field\nstrength of 8 \u03bcG on size scales greater than 200 pc. We speculate that the elongation of the\ndiffuse synchrotron emission is due to a uniform field component. Using simple estimates of\nthe Alfv\u00e9n speed and the density of the region along with upper limits on the polarization\nfrom our data, we place an upper limit of 7.6\u03bcG on the uniform field strength in this region\nand calculate a total field strength of 13 \u03bcG and a random field strength of 11 \u03bcG. These\nlimits are consistent with the observed elongation of the diffuse synchrotron region.\nWe use the simple model developed in Section 4.5.2 to estimate the cosmic ray confinement time in NGC 4214 and find it to be appropriately 10 Myr, comparable to the diffusion\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\ntime in the Milky Way. Synchrotron losses and a galactic wind may further limit the lifetimes\nof cosmic rays in the galaxy.\nFinally, we investigate whether an \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c9 dynamo could operate in NGC 4214 by comparing its shear and supernova rate to that of the Milky Way. We find that the shear in\nNGC 4214 is comparable to the Milky Way, but that the supernova rate is half that of the\nMilky Way. We suggest that there is not enough turbulence yet in the NGC 4214 to drive\nan \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c9 dynamo, but that as the star formation in NGC 4214 progresses the additional\nturbulence will allow an \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c9 dynamo to operate.\nOf the low mass irregular galaxies with measured magnetic fields, we find that the\nmagnetic field of NGC 4214 most resembles that of IC 10, i.e., strong with some evidence of\nuniform fields. In a future paper, we will investigate the properties of all observed magnetic\nfields in irregular galaxies and attempt to create an integrated picture of how they are\ngenerated and sustained in these galaxies.\nThe authors thank the referee for their careful report.

Here we assume that the\ndensity distribution of NGC 4214 can be approximated by an isothermal sphere with density\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\ndistribution\n\n\u0010 r \u00112\n0\n\n(A2)\nr\n(Kepley et al. 2007; van Eymeren et al. 2009), where \u03c10 and r0 are the central density and\ncore radius, \u03c1 is density, and r is radius. Note that the rotation curves of galaxies are more\ntypically fit with a pseudo-isothermal sphere\n\u0014\n\u0010 r \u00112 \u0015\u22121\n0\n\u03c1(r) = \u03c10 1 +\n(A3)\nr\n\u03c1(r) = \u03c10\n\nwhich does not have infinite density at zero radius like Equation (A2) does. As r becomes\nlarge, the density from Equation (A2) tends to the density from Equation (A3). We are\nmeasuring the potential far from the center of the galaxy, so we assume that Equation (A2)\napplies, which yields a much more analytically tractable result. The mass interior to radius\nr, M(r), is then just\nZ r\nM(r) =\n4\u03c0\u03c1(r \u2032 )(r \u2032 )2 dr \u2032\n(A4)\n0\n\n= 4\u03c0\u03c10 r02 r\n\n(A5)\n\nThe potential energy of an individual shell, dU, is then\n\u2212GM(r) dm\nr\n\u2212GM(r) 4\u03c0r 2 \u03c1(r) dr\n=\nr\n= \u221216\u03c0 2 G\u03c120 r04 r\n\ndU =\n\n(A6)\n(A7)\n(A8)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant. Integrating this expression out to a radius R and\nsubstituting for \u03c10 gives the potential energy, U, for an isothermal sphere\nU=\n\n\u2212GM 2\nR\n\n(A9)\n\nFor an ideal gas, the kinetic energy is just\n3\nK = PV\n2\n\n(A10)\n\nwhere P is the pressure and V is the volume of the galaxy. Inserting the expressions for\nthe potential and kinetic energies into the Virial Theorem and dividing by the Boltzmann\nconstant (k) to put the pressure in units of K cm\u22123 , we obtain the expression\nGM 2\nP\n=\n.\nk\n3RV k\n\n(A11)\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\nSince V = (4/3)\u03c0R3 and the circular velocity v at radius R in the galaxy is just v 2 = GM/R,\nEquation (A11) can be rewritten as\nP\nv4\n=\n.\nk\n4\u03c0GR2 k\n\n(A12)\n\nWe would note that regardless of the potential equation we use (isothermal sphere,\nconstant density, \u03c1 \u221d r 2 , etc.), the multiplicative factor in front of the potential changes\nby only a factor of 2. Since the gravitational pressure is proportional to the total potential\nenergy, changes in the assumed form of the potential only change the gravitational pressure\nby a factor of a few.\n\nREFERENCES\nAllsopp, N.

The images are all on the same\nlogarithmic scale stretching from 72.3 \u03bcJy beam\u22121 to 20 mJy beam\u22121 . The contours are 3,\n6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, and 384 times the 1\u03c3 noise level given in Table 2. The beam is boxed\nin the lower left corner of each panel and is identical for all three images. The diameter of\nthe circles in the middle and right panels show the largest angular scale imaged by the VLA\nat 6 cm and 3 cm, respectively. The largest angular scale imaged by the VLA at 20 cm is\nlarger than the size of the region shown.\n\n\f\u2013 36 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- 3 cm radio continuum emission per 14\u2032\u2032 annulus about the center of the galaxy as\na function of radius. The presence of a large negative bowl of emission, which is not seen\nhere, would indicate that significant flux is resolved out.\n\n\f\u2013 37 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Radio continuum spectrum of NGC 4214. The open points are previous measurements and the solid points are our measurements from this paper. The line is the best power\nlaw fit to our measurements; see the discussion in \u00a7 3.1.\n\n\f\u2013 38 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Spectral index between the 20 cm and 6 cm data (left panel) and between the\n6 cm and 3 cm data (right panel). Pixels below 3\u03c3 in the input images were masked before\ncalculation of the spectral indices. The contours show the total intensity radio continuum\nemission at 6 cm. The contours are 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, and 384 times the 1\u03c3 noise level\ngiven in Table 2. The beam is boxed in the lower left corner of each panel.\n\nFig. 5.- Polarized intensity vectors (E-vectors) overlaid on contours showing the total\nintensity radio continuum emission of NGC 4214 at 20 cm (left panel), 6 cm (middle panel),\nand 3 cm (right panel). The polarized intensities have been bias corrected and only vectors\nwith a signal to noise greater than 3 are shown. The contours are 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192,\nand 384 times the 1\u03c3 noise level given in Table 2. The beam and the polarization vector\nscale bar are boxed in the right hand corner of each panel. The beam is identical for all three\nimages. The length of the polarization vector scale bar corresponds to a polarized intensity\nof 5.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 Jy beam\u22121 .\n\n\f\u2013 39 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- 20 cm total intensity radio continuum emission contours overlaid on a three color\noptical image of NGC 4214. The optical images are courtesy D. Hunter and red represents\nH\u03b1, blue the U band optical, and green V band optical. The contours are 3, 6, 12, 24, 48,\n96, 192, and 384 times the 1\u03c3 noise level given in Table 2.\n\n\f\u2013 40 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- Contours of total intensity radio continuum emission at 20 cm (left panel), 6 cm\n(middle panel), and 3 cm (right panel) overlaid on an H\u03b1 image of NGC 4214 kindly provided\nby Deidre Hunter (Hunter & Elmegreen 2004). The contours are 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192,\nand 384 times the 1\u03c3 noise level given in Table 2. The beam is boxed in the lower left corner\nof each panel.\n\nFig. 8.- Contours of total intensity radio continuum emission at 20 cm (left panel), 6 cm\n(middle panel), and 3 cm (right panel) overlaid on an optical V band image of NGC 4214\nkindly provided by Deidre Hunter (Hunter & Elmegreen 2006). The contours are 3, 6, 12,\n24, 48, 96, 192, and 384 times the 1\u03c3 noise level given in Table 2. The beam is boxed in the\nlower left corner of each panel.\n\n\f\u2013 41 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- Estimated thermal fraction of NGC 4214 with contours of total intensity radio\ncontinuum emission at 20 cm (left panel), 6 cm (middle panel), and 3 cm (right panel). The\ncontours are 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, and 384 times the 1\u03c3 noise level given in Table 2. The\nbeam is boxed in the lower left corner of each panel.\n\n\f\u2013 42 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.- Magnetic field strength (in \u03bcG) calculated using the estimated synchrotron\nemission at 6 cm. The magnetic field has not been calculated for the background AGN at\n(12h 15m 48.9s , 36\u25e621\u2032 54.10\u2032\u2032 ) since it does not belong to NGC 4214. The beam is boxed in the\nlower left.\n\n\f\u2013 43 \u2013\n\nFig. 11.- Absolute value of the shear calculated using the neutral hydrogen rotation curve\nfrom Allsopp (1979), corrected for the distance adopted in this paper and for the inclination\nof NGC 4214, as a function of radius.\n\n\f"}
