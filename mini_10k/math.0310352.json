The proof\nis based on the technique of boxes and reduction algorithm. It implies,\nin particular, that any degeneration of a derived wild algebra is derived\nwild; respectively, any deformation of a derived tame algebra is derived\ntame.\n\nIntroduction\nThe notions of tame and wild problems is now rather poplar in various\nbranches of representation theory and related topics, especially because of\nthe so-called tame-wild dichotomy (cf. e.g. [3, 7] and other papers). Namely,\nin most cases it so happens that either indecomposable representations depend on at most one parameter or their description becomes in some sense\n\"universal,\" i.e. containing a classification of representations of all finitely\ngenerated algebras. Last time these notions have also been studied for derived categories, and tame-wild dichotomy has been proved in some cases\n(though rather restrictive ones), cf. [9, 1, 8]. In this paper we shall prove\nsuch a dichotomy for derived categories of arbitrary finite dimensional algebras over an algebraically closed field. The used technique, just as in [3, 7]\n(see also the survey [4]), is that of \"matrix problems,\" more precisely, boxes\nand reduction algorithm. There are some new features: we have to consider\nsuch boxes that the underlying category is no more free. Fortunately, the\narising relations are of rather special nature, which leads to the notion of\nsliced boxes. Actually, the tame-wild dichotomy is proved for such boxes,\nwherefrom the result for derived categories is obtained almost in the same\nway as the tame-wild dichotomy for representations of algebras has been obtained from that for free boxes. As it is rather usual, we formulate the result\nfor locally finite dimensional categories. If such a category only has finitely\nmany indecomposable objects, this language is equivalent to that of finite\ndimensional algebras, though a bit more convenient. But categories with infinitely many indecomposables naturally arise in representation theory (for\ninstance, when we consider coverings), so we prefer to use this language,\nespecially as this generality does not imply the proofs.\n\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Derived categories\nWe consider categories and algebras over a fixed algebraically closed field\nk. A k-category A is called locally finite dimensional (shortly lofd) if the\nfollowing conditions hold:\n1. All spaces A(x, y) are finite dimensional for all objects x, y.\n2. A is fully additive, i.e. it is additive and all idempotents in it split.\nConditions 1,2 imply that the category A is Krull\u2013Schmidt, i.e. each\nobject uniquely decomposes into a direct sum of indecomposable objects; moreover, it is local, i.e. for each indecomposable object x the\nalgebra A(x, x) is local. We denote by ind A a set of representatives\nof isomorphism classes of indecomposable objects from A.\n3. For each object x the set { y \u2208 ind A | A(x, y) 6= 0 or A(y, x) 6= 0 } is\nfinite.\nWe denote by vec the category of finite dimensional vector spaces over k\nand by A-mod the category of finite dimensional A-modules, i.e. functors\nM : A \u2192 vec such that { x \u2208 ind A | M x 6= 0 } is finite. We also denote by\nD(A) the derived category of the category A-mod and by D b (A) its full\nsubcategory consisting of bounded complexes. The latter is again a lofd\ncategory.\nFor an arbitrary category C we denote by add C the minimal fully additive\ncategory containing C. For instance, one can consider add C as the category\nof finitely generated projective C-modules; especially, add k = vec. We denote by Rep(A, C) the category of functors Fun(A, add C) and call them\nrepresentations of the category A in a category C. Obviously, Rep(A, C) \u2243\nRep(add A, C). If the category A is lofd, we denote by rep(A, C) the full subcategory of Rep(A, C) consisting of the representations M with finite support\nsupp M = { x \u2208 ind A | M x 6= 0 }. In particular, rep(A, k) = A-mod.\nWe denote by D(A) (respectively, D \u2212 (A), D b (A) ) the derived category\n(respectively, right bounded and (two-sided) bounded derived category) of\nthe category A-mod, where A is a lofd category. Recall that A embeds as\na full subcategory into A-mod. Namely, each object x corresponds to the\nfunctor Ax = A(x, ). These functors are projective in the category A-mod;\nif A is fully additive, these are all projectives (up to isomorphism). On\nthe other hand, A-mod embeds as a full subcategory into D b (A): a module M is treated as a complex only having a unique nonzero component\nequal M at the 0-th position. It is also known that D \u2212 (A) can be identified\nwith the category K\u2212 (A) whose objects are right bounded complexes of projective modules and morphisms are homomorphisms of complexes modulo\nhomotopy [10]. If gl.dim A < \u221e, every bounded complex has a bounded\nprojective resolution, hence D b (A) can identified with Kb (A), the category\nof bounded projective complexes modulo homotopy, but it is no more the\ncase if gl.dim A = \u221e. Moreover, if A is lofd, we can confine the considered\ncomplexes by minimal ones, i.e. always suppose that Im dn \u2286 rad Pn\u22121 for\nall n. We denote by J the radical of the category A, i.e. the set of morphisms having no invertible components with respect to some (hence, any)\ndecomposition of its source and target into direct sums of indecomposables.\nThen rad M = JM for each M \u2208 A-mod.\n\n\fTAME\u2013WILD DICHOTOMY FOR DERIVED CATEGORIES\n\n3\n\nEven if gl.dim A = \u221e, one easily shows [5] that D b (A) can be identified\nwith a direct limit limN QN (A) of the categories QN (A) defined as follows.\n\u2212\u2192\n1. Objects of QN (A) are right bounded complexes (P\u2022 , d\u2022 ) of projective\nmodules from A-mod with Pn = 0 for n > N .\n2. Morphisms of QN (A) are homomorphisms of complexes modulo quasihomotopy, where two homomorphisms f, g : (P\u2022 , d\u2022 ) \u2192 (P\u2022\u2032 , d\u2032\u2022 ) are\nsaid to be quasi-homotopic if there are homomorphisms of modules\n\u2032\nsuch that fn \u2212 gn = d\u2032n+1 sn + sn\u22121 dn for all n < N .\nsn : Pn \u2192 Pn+1\n3. The functor QN (A) \u2192 QN +1 (A) maps a complex (P\u2022 , d\u2022 ) to a complex\nh\n0 \u2192 P\u0302n+1 \u2212\u2192 Pn \u2192 Pn\u22121 \u2192 * * * \u2192 Pm \u2192 0,\nwhere h maps P\u0302n+1 onto Ker dn . (Such a complex is defined up to an\nisomorphism inside QN +1 (A).)\nNote that these functors are full embeddings; thus all functors QN (A) \u2192\nb\nb\nD\nS (A)Nare full embeddings too, so we may treat D (A) as a sort of union\nN Q (A). Especially, in all classification problems, we may replace the\nstudy of the category D b (A) by that of the categories QN (A). If A is lofd,\nany complex from QN (A) is isomorphic (in this category) to a minimal\ncomplex P\u2022 such that Ker dN \u2286 rad PN . We denote by QN\n0 (A) the full\nN\nsubcategory of Q (A) only consisting of such complexes. Thus D b (A) \u2243\nlimN QN\n0 (A).\n\u2212\u2192\nN\nProposition 1.1. Two complexes from QN\n0 (A) are isomorphic in Q (A)\nif and only if they are isomorphic as complexes.\nN\nProof. If two complexes P\u2022 , P\u2022\u2032 from QN\n0 (A) are isomorphic in Q (A), there\nis a diagram\n\nPO N\n\u03c8N\n\ndN\n\n\u03c8N\u22121\n\n\u03c6N\n\n\u000f\n\nPN\u2032\n\n/ PN \u22121\nO\n\nd\u2032N\n\ndN\u22121\n\n\u03c6N\u22121\n\n\u000f\n\n/ P\u2032\nN \u22121\n\n/ PN \u22122\nO\n\u03c8N\u22122\n\nd\u2032N\u22121\n\n/ ...\n\n\u03c6N\u22122\n\n\u000f\n\n/ P\u2032\nN \u22122\n\n/ ... ,\n\nwhere all upgoing and downgoing squares commute. Moreover, all products\n\u03c8n \u03c6n (n < N ) are of the form 1 + \u03c3n\u22121 dn + dn+1 \u03c3n , thus isomorphisms, as\nwell as all products \u03c6n \u03c8n (n < N ). Hence all \u03c6n , \u03c8n (n < N ) are isomorphisms. As \u03c6N \u22121 (Im dN ) \u2286 Im d\u2032N and \u03c8N \u22121 (Im d\u2032N ) \u2286 Im dN , it implies\nthat Im dN \u2243 Im d\u2032N . Since Ker dN \u2286 rad PN , the latter is a projective\ncover of Im dN , and PN\u2032 is a projective cover of Im d\u2032N . Therefore PN \u2243 PN\u2032 .\nMoreover, \u03c6N d\u2032N = \u03c6N \u22121 dN : PN \u2192 Im d\u2032N \u22121 is an epimorphism, hence\nIm \u03c6N + Ker d\u2032N = PN\u2032 , so \u03c6N is an epimorphism, thus an isomorphism. \u0003\nWe introduce the notions of derived tame and derived wild lofd categories\nin the following way, which do not formally coincide with those of some\nearlier papers, such as [1, 8, 9], but is equivalent to them. Due to the\npreceding considerations, it is more convenient to deal with.\n\n\f4\n\nVIKTOR I. BEKKERT AND YURIY A. DROZD\n\nDefinition 1.2. Let A be a lofd category.\n1. The rank of an object x \u2208 A (or of the corresponding projective\nmodL\nule Ax ) is the function r(x) : ind A \u2192 Z such that x \u2243 y\u2208ind A r(x)(y)y.\nThe vector rank r\u2022 (P\u2022 ) of a bounded complex of projective A-modules\nis the sequence (. . . , r(Pn ), r(Pn\u22121 ), . . . ) (actually it only has finitely\nmany nonzero entries).\n2. We call a rational family of bounded minimal complexes over A\na bounded complex (P\u2022 , d\u2022 ) of finitely generated projective A \u2297 Rmodules, where R is a rational algebra, i.e. R = k[t, f (t)\u22121 ] for a\nnonzero polynomial f (t), and Im dn \u2286 JPn\u22121 For such a complex\nwe define P\u2022 (m, \u03bb), where m \u2208 N, \u03bb \u2208 k, f (\u03bb) 6= 0, the complex\n(P\u2022 \u2297R R/(t \u2212 \u03bb)m , d\u2022 \u2297 1). It is indeed a complex of projective Amodules. We put r\u2022 (P\u2022 ) = r\u2022 (P\u2022 (1, \u03bb)) (this vector rank does not\ndepend on \u03bb).\n3. We call a lofd category A derived tame if there is a set P of rational\nfamilies of bounded complexes over A such that:\n(a) For each vector rank r\u2022 the set P(r\u2022 ) = { P\u2022 \u2208 P | r\u2022 (P\u2022 ) = r }\nis finite.\n(b) For each vector rank r\u2022 all indecomposable complexes (P\u2022 , d\u2022 )\nof projective A-modules of this vector rank, except finitely many\nisomorphism classes, are isomorphic to P\u2022 (m, \u03bb) for some P\u2022 \u2208 P\nand some m, \u03bb.\nThe set P is called a parameterising set of A-complexes.\n4. We call a lofd category A derived wild if there is a bounded complex\nP\u2022 of projective modules over A \u2297 \u03a3, where \u03a3 is the free k-algebra in\n2 variables, such that, for every finite dimensional \u03a3-modules L, L\u2032 ,\n(a) P\u2022 \u2297\u03a3 L \u2243 P\u2022 \u2297\u03a3 L\u2032 if and only if L \u2243 L\u2032 .\n(b) P\u2022 \u2297\u03a3 L is indecomposable if and only if so is L.\n(It is well-known that then an analogous complex of A \u2297 \u0393-modules\nexists for every finitely generated k-algebra \u0393.)\nNote that, according to these definitions, every derived discrete (in particular, derived finite) lofd category [12] is derived tame (with the empty set P).\nSimple geometric considerations, like in [2], show that neither lofd category\ncan be both derived tame and derived wild. We are going to demonstrate\nthe following result.\nTheorem 1.3 (Main Theorem). Every lofd category over an algebraically\nclosed field is either derived tame or derived wild.\nThis theorem will be proved in Section 3. Note that, in particular, it\nmakes valid the following corollaries, which have been proved in [5] under\nsupposition that every finite dimensional algebra is either derived tame or\nderived wild.\nCorollary 1.4. Let A be a flat family of finite dimensional algebras based\non an algebraic variety X. Then the set { x \u2208 X | A(x) is derived wild } is\na union of a countable sequence of closed subsets.\nCorollary 1.5. Suppose that a finite dimensional algebra A degenerates to\nanother algebra B (or, the same, B deforms to A), i.e. there is a flat family\n\n\fTAME\u2013WILD DICHOTOMY FOR DERIVED CATEGORIES\n\n5\n\nof algebras A based on a variety X such that A(x) \u2243 A for all x from a\ndense open subset U \u2286 X and there is a point y \u2208 X such that A(y) \u2243 B.\nIf A is derived wild, so is B; respectively, if B is derived tame, so is A.\nIf the families are not assumed flat, these assertions are no more true [1]\n(see [5, 6] for further comments).\n2. Related boxes\nRecall [3, 4] that a box is a pair A = (A, V) consisting of a category A and\nan A-coalgebra V. We denote by \u03bc the comultiplication in V, by \u03b5 its counit\nand by V = Ker \u03b5 its kernel. We always suppose that A is normal, i.e. there\nis a section \u03c9 : x 7\u2192 \u03c9x (x \u2208 ob A) such that \u03b5(\u03c9x ) = 1x and \u03bc(\u03c9x ) = \u03c9x \u2297\u03c9x\nfor all x. A category A is called free if it is isomorphic to a path category\nk\u0393 of an oriented graph (quiver) \u0393, and semi-free if A = k\u0393[L\u22121 ], where L\nis a set of loops, i.e. arrows a : x \u2192 x from \u0393. The arrows a : x \u2192 y with\nx 6= y will be called edges. If \u0393 contains no arrows at all, the category A is\ncalled trivial; if \u0393 only has loops, and at most one loop at every vertex x, A\nis called minimal. A normal box A = (A, V) is called free (semi-free) if so\nis the category A, while the kernel V is a free A-bimodule. If we fix a set of\nfree generators \u2206 of V, we call the elements from \u2206 dashed arrows of the box\nA, while the arrows of \u0393 are called solid arrows. The union Arr A = \u0393 \u222a \u2206\nis called a set of free (or semi-free) generators of the free (semi-free) box\nA. We also call the objects of A the vertices of A, denote by Ver A the set\nof vertices, and write Arr0 A = \u0393, Arr1 A = \u2206. Note that a choice of free\n(semi-free) generators is usually not unique, and most of proofs related to\nboxes use a change of free (semi-free) generators.\nRecall that the differential of a normal box A = (A, V) is the pair \u2202 =\n(\u22020 , \u22021 ) of mappings, \u22020 : A \u2192 V, \u22021 : V \u2192 V \u2297A V, namely\n\u22020 a = a\u03c9x \u2212 \u03c9y a\n\nfor a \u2208 A(x, y),\n\n\u22021 v = \u03bc(v) \u2212 v \u2297 \u03c9x \u2212 \u03c9y \u2297 v\n\nfor v \u2208 V(x, y).\n\nUsually we omit the index and write both \u2202a and \u2202v. A set of arrows Arr A\nof semi-free box is said to be triangular, if there is a function h : Arr A \u2192 N\n(called height) such that, for any a \u2208 Arr A (either solid or dashed) \u2202a\nbelongs to the sub-box generated by the arrows b \u2208 Arr A with \u2202b < \u2202a,\nespecially, \u2202a = 0 if h(a) = 0. If such a set of arrows exists, we call the box\nA triangular.\nA normal box A such that the category A is trivial, is called so-trivial\n(trivial with respect to solid arrows). If A is a minimal category and \u2202a = 0\nfor each solid loop, we call the box A so-minimal.\nIn what follows we also use boxes, which are not free (or semi-free), but\nare their factors. Namely, let A = (A, V) be a semi-free box, I \u2286 A be an\nideal of the category A such that \u2202a \u2208 IV + VI for all a \u2208 I. Denote by\nA/I the box (\u00c3, \u1e7c), where \u00c3 = A/I and \u1e7c = V/(IV + VI), with natural\ncomultiplication and counit. Note that in this case the kernel of the box\nA/I is a free \u00c3-bimodule, namely, it is isomorphic to V/(IV + VI). If A is a\ntriangular semi-free box and the ideal I is contained in the ideal generated\n\n\f6\n\nVIKTOR I. BEKKERT AND YURIY A. DROZD\n\nby all products ab, where a, b are solid arrows, we call \u00c3 = A/I a convenient\nbox. The vertices and arrows of \u00c3 are, by definitions, those of A. Especially,\nthe notions of triangular set of arrows and triangular box are transmitted\nto convenient boxes. Actually, we need a rather specific kind of convenient\nboxes, defined as follows.\nDefinition 2.1.\n1. A free box A is called sliced if there is a function\ns : Ver A \u2192 Z such that\n(a) s(y) < s(x) for every solid arrow a : x \u2192 y; we set s(a) = s(x);\n(b) s(x) = s(y) for every dashed arrow \u03b3 : x 99K y; we set s(\u03b3) =\ns(x) = s(y).\n2. A box \u00c3 = A/I, where A = (A, V) is a free box and I \u2282 A is an ideal\nin A such that \u2202a \u2208 IV + VI for all a \u2208 I, is called sliced if so is the\nbox A.\nWe call the function s a slicing of the box A or \u00c3.\nNote that if a free box A is sliced, there are neither loops nor oriented\ncycles in it. Therefore, if an ideal I is not contained in the ideal generated\nby the paths of length 2, we are able just drop an arrow that occur in an\nelement of I. Hence sliced boxes are always convenient.\nA representation of a box A = (A, V) over a category C is defined as a\nfunctor M : A \u2192 add C. A morphism of such representations f : M \u2192 N is\ndefined as a homomorphisms of A-modules V \u2297A M \u2192 N . If g : N \u2192 L is\nanother morphism, there product is defined as the composition\n\u03bc\u22971\n\n1\u2297f\n\ng\n\nV \u2297A M \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 V \u2297A V \u2297A M \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 V \u2297A N \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 L.\nThus we obtain the category of representations Rep(A, C). If A is a free (or\na convenient) box, we denote by rep(A, C) the full subcategory of Rep(A, C)\nconsisting of representations with finite support supp M = { x \u2208 Ver A | M x 6= 0 }.\nIf C = vec, we write Rep(A) and rep(A).\nGiven a lofd A, we are going to construct a sliced box B = B(A) = (B, W)\nsuch that its representations classify the objects of the derived category\nD b (A).\nWe denote by S the trivial category with the set of objects\nob S = { (x, n) | x \u2208 ind A, n \u2208 Z }\nand consider the S-bimodule J such that\n(\n\u0001\n0\nJ (x, n), (y, m) =\nJ(x, y)\u2217\n\nif m 6= n \u2212 1,\nif m = n \u2212 1,\n\nwhere J is the radical of A and V \u2217 denotes the dual vector space to V . Let\nB\u0303 = S[J ] be the tensor category of this bimodule; equivalently, it is the free\ncategory having\u0001 the same set of objects as S and the union of bases of all\nJ (x, n), (y, m) as a set of free generators. Denote by U the S-bimodule\nsuch that\n(\n\u0001\n0\nif n 6= m,\nU (x, n), (y, m) =\n\u2217\nA(x, y) if n = m\n\n\fTAME\u2013WILD DICHOTOMY FOR DERIVED CATEGORIES\n\n7\n\nand set \u0168 = B\u0303 \u2297S U \u2297S B\u0303. Dualizing the multiplication A(y, z) \u2297 A(x, y) \u2192\nA(x, z), we get homomorphisms\n\u03bbr : B\u0303 \u2212\u2192 B\u0303 \u2297S \u0168 ,\n\u03bbl : B\u0303 \u2212\u2192 \u0168 \u2297S B\u0303,\n\u03bc\u0303 : \u0168 \u2212\u2192 \u0168 \u2297S \u0168 .\nIn particular, \u03bc\u0303 defines on \u0168 a structure of B\u0303-coalgebra. Moreover, the\nsub-bimodule U0 generated by Im(\u03bbr \u2212 \u03bbl ) is a coideal in \u0168 , i.e. \u03bc\u0303(U0 ) \u2286\nU0 \u2297B\u0303 \u0168 \u2295 \u0168 \u2297B\u0303 U0 . Therefore, W\u0303 = \u0168 /U0 is also a B\u0303-coalgebra, so we get a\nbox B\u0303 = (B\u0303, W\u0303). One easily checks, like in [3], that it is free and triangular.\nDualizing multiplication also gives a mapping\n(1)\n\n\u03bd : J(x, y)\u2217 \u2212\u2192\n\nM\n\nJ(z, y)\u2217 \u2297 J(x, z)\u2217 .\n\nz\n\nNamely, if we choose bases { \u03b1 } , { \u03b2 } { \u03b3 } in the spaces, respectively, J(x, y),\nJ(z, y), J(x, z), and dual bases { \u03b1\u2217 } , { \u03b2 \u2217 } , { \u03b3 \u2217 } in their duals, then \u03b2 \u2217 \u2297\n\u03b3 \u2217 occurs in \u03bd(\u03b1\u2217 ) with the same coefficient as \u03b1 occurs in \u03b2\u03b3. Note\n\u0001 that\nthe right-hand space in (1) coincide with each B\u0303 (x, n), (y, n \u2212 2) . Let\nI be the ideal in B\u0303 generated by the images of \u03bd in all these spaces and\nB = B\u0303/I = (B, W), where B = B\u0303/I, W = W\u0303/(IW\u0303 + W\u0303I). One easily checks\nthat \u2202I \u2286 IW\u0303 + W\u0303I, so it is a convenient box. If necessary, we write B(A)\nto emphasise that this box has been constructed from a given algebra A.\nCertainly, B is a sliced triangular box, and the following result holds.\nTheorem 2.2. The category of finite dimensional representations rep(B(A))\nb (A) of bounded minimal projective Ais equivalent to the category Pmin\ncomplexes.\nProof. We denote Jx = J(x, ) = rad Ax . Then HomA (Ax , Jy ) \u2243 J(x, y).\nA representation M \u2208 rep(B) is given by vector spaces M (x, n) and linear\nmappings\n\u0001\n\u0001\nMxy (n) : J(x, y)\u2217 = A (x, n), (y, n \u2212 1) \u2192 Hom M (x, n), M (y, n \u2212 1) ,\n\nwhere x, y \u2208 ind A, n \u2208 Z, subject to the relations\n(2)\n\nX\nz\n\n\u0001\nm Mzy (n) \u2297 Mxz (n + 1) \u03bd(\u03b1) = 0\n\nfor all x, y, n and all \u03b1 \u2208 Jxy , where m denotes the multiplication of mappings\n\u0001\n\u0001\nHom M (z, n), M (y, n \u2212 1) \u2297 Hom M (x, n + 1), M (z, n) \u2192\n\n\u0001\n\u2192 Hom M (x, n + 1), M (y, n \u2212 1) .\n\n\f8\n\nVIKTOR I. BEKKERT AND YURIY A. DROZD\n\nL x\nFor\na representation, set Pn =\nx A \u2297 M (x, n). Then rad Pn =\nL such\nx \u2297 M (x, n) and\nJ\nx\nM\n\u0001\nHom(Pn , rad Pn\u22121 ) \u2243\nHom Ax \u2297 M (x, n), Jy \u2297 M (y, n \u2212 1) \u2243\nA\n\nx,y\n\n\u2243\n\nM\nx,y\n\n\u2243\n\nM\n\nA\n\n\u0001\u0001\nHom M (x, n), Hom Ax , Jy \u2297 M (y, n \u2212 1) \u2243\nA\n\nM (x, n)\u2217 \u2297 J(x, y) \u2297 M (y, n \u2212 1) \u2243\n\nx,y\n\n\u2243\n\nM\nx,y\n\n\u0001\u0001\nHom J\u2217 (x, y), Hom M (x, n), M (y, n \u2212 1) .\n\nThus the set { Mxy (n) | x, y \u2208 ind A } defines a homomorphism dn : Pn \u2192\nPn\u22121 and vice versa. Moreover, one easily verifies that the condition (2) is\nequivalent to the relation\nL dn dn+1 = 0. Since every projective A-module can\nbe given in the form x Ax \u2297 Vx for some uniquely defined vector spaces\nVx , we get a one-to-one correspondence between finite dimensional representations of B and bounded minimal complexes of projective A-modules. In\nthe same way one also establishes one-to-one correspondence between morphisms of representations and of the corresponding complexes, compatible\nwith their multiplication, which accomplishes the proof.\n\u0003\nNote that we can pick up subcategories of rep(B) that describe each of\nQN (A). Namely, denote by repN (B) the full subcategory of rep(B) consisting of all representations M such that M (x, n) = 0 for n > N . Let TN\nbe the ideal of repN (B) generated by the identity morphisms of trivial representations Sx,N , where Sx,N (x, N ) = k, Sx,N (y, n) = 0 if (y, n) 6= (x, N ).\nb (A) maps repObviously, the equivalence of the categories rep(B) and Pmin\nN\nresentations from rep (B) onto the complexes P\u2022 with Pn = 0 for n > N .\nMoreover, it maps Sx,N to the complex T\u2022x,N with TNx,N = Ax , Tnx,N = 0 for\nn 6= N . Note that a morphism of complexes from QN (A) is quasi-homotopic\nto zero if and only if it factorises through a direct sum of complexes T\u2022x,N .\nIt gives the following\nCorollary 2.3. The category QN (A) is equivalent to the factor category\nrepN (B)/TN .\n\u0001\n\u0001\nEvidently, ind repN (B)/TN = ind repN (B) \\ { Sx,N | x \u2208 Ver A }.\n\nCorollary 2.4. An algebra A is derived tame (derived wild) if so is the box\nB(A).\n3. Proof of the Main Theorem\n\nNow we are able to prove the main theorem. Namely, according to Corollary 2.4, it follows from the analogous result for sliced boxes.\nTheorem 3.1. Every sliced triangular box is either tame or wild.\nActually, just as in [3] (see also [4]), we shall prove this theorem in the\nfollowing form.\n\n\fTAME\u2013WILD DICHOTOMY FOR DERIVED CATEGORIES\n\n9\n\nTheorem 3.1a. Suppose that a sliced triangular box A = (A, V) is not\nwild. For every dimension d of its representations there is a functor Fd :\nA \u2192 add M, where M is a minimal category, such that every representation\nM : A \u2192 vec of A of dimension dim(M ) \u2264 d is isomorphic to the inverse\nimage F \u2217 N = N \u25e6 F for some functor N : M \u2192 vec. Moreover, F can be\nchosen strict, which means that F \u2217 N \u2243 F \u2217 N \u2032 implies N \u2243 N \u2032 and F \u2217 N is\nindecomposable if so is N .\nRemark. We can consider the induced box AF = (M, M\u2297A V \u2297A M). It is a\nso-minimal box, and F \u2217 defines a full and faithful functor rep(AF ) \u2192 rep(A).\nIts image consists of all representations M : A \u2192 vec that factorise through\nF.\nProof. As we only consider finite dimensional representations, we may assume that the set of objects is finite. Then we may assume that all values\nof a slicing s : Ver A \u2192 Z belong to N, and there are finitely many of them.\nLet m = max { s(x) | x \u2208 Ver A }. We use induction on m. If m = 1, A is\nfree, and our claim has been proved in [3]. So we may suppose that the\ntheorem is true for smaller values of m, especially, it is true for the restriction A\u2032 = (A\u2032 , V \u2032 ) of the box A onto the subset V = { x \u2208 Ver A | s(x) < m }.\nThus there is a strict functor F \u2032 : A\u2032 \u2192 add M, where M is a minimal\ncategory, such that every representation of A\u2032 of dimension smaller than d\nis of the form F \u2032 \u2217 N for N : M \u2192 vec. Consider now the amalgamation\nF \u2032\nB = A A M and the box B = (B, W), where W = B \u2297A V \u2297A B. The\nfunctor F \u2032 extends to a functor F : A \u2192 B and induces a homomorphism of\nA-bimodules V \u2192 W; so it defines a functor F \u2217 : rep(B) \u2192 rep(A), which is\nfull and faithful. Moreover, every representation of A of dimension smaller\nthan d is isomorphic to F \u2217 N for some N , and all possible dimensions of\nsuch N are restricted by some vector b. Therefore, it is enough to prove the\nclaim of the theorem for the box B.\nNote that the category B is generated by the loops from M and the\nimages of arrows from A(a, b) with s(a) = m (we call them new arrows). It\nimplies\nthat all possible relations between these morphisms are of the form\nP\n\u03b1 g\u03b1 (\u03b2)\u03b1 = 0, where \u03b2 \u2208 B(b, b) is a loop (necessarily minimal, i.e. with\n\u2202\u03b2 = 0), g\u03b1 are some polynomials, and \u03b1 runs through the set of new arrows\nfrom a to b for some a P\nwith s(a) = m. Consider all of these relations for\na fixed a;\nlet\nthem\nbe\n\u03b1 g\u03b1,k (\u03b2)\u03b1 = 0. Their coefficients form a matrix\n\u0001\ng\u03b1,k (\u03b2) . Using transformations of the set { \u03b2 } and of the set of relations,\nwe can make this matrix diagonal, i.e. make all relations being f\u03b1 (\u03b2)\u03b1 = 0\nfor some polynomials f\u03b1 . If one of f\u03b1 is zero, the box B has a sub-box\na\n\n\u03b1\n\n/bd\n\n\u03b2\n\n,\n\nwith \u2202\u03b1 = \u2202\u03b2 = 0, which is wild; hence B and A are also wild. Otherwise,\nlet f (\u03b2) 6= 0 be a common multiple of all f\u03b1 (\u03b2), \u039b = { \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbr } be\nthe set of roots of f (\u03b2). If N \u2208 rep(B) is such that N (\u03b2) has no eigenvalues\nfrom \u039b, then f (N (\u03b2)) is invertible; thus N (\u03b1) = 0 for all \u03b1 : a \u2192 b. So\nwe can apply the reduction of the loop \u03b2 with respect to the set \u039b and the\ndimension d(a), as in [3, Propositions 3,4] or [4, Theorem 6.4]. It gives a new\nbox that has the same number of loops as B, but the loop corresponding\n\n\f10\n\nVIKTOR I. BEKKERT AND YURIY A. DROZD\n\nto \u03b2 is \"isolated,\" i.e. there are no more arrows starting or ending at the\nsame vertex. In the same way we are able to isolate all loops, obtaining a\nsemi-free triangular box C and a morphism G : B \u2192 C such that G\u2217 is full\nand faithful and all representations of B of dimensions smaller than b are\nof the form G\u2217 L. As the theorem is true for semi-free boxes, it accomplishes\nthe proof.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] Th. Br\u00fcstle. Tree Algebras and Quadratic Forms. Habilitation Thesis.
