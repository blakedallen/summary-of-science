E. Hramov\nAbstract-The results of numerical modeling of oscillations in a system of two coupled oscillators operating\non the basis of a virtual cathode (VC) with controlled external feedback are presented. It is shown that there\nexist the modes with generation of chaotic signals and synchronization modes with high signal-to-noise ratio.\nThe effect of parameters of the electron beam and external feedback on the generation frequency of the system\nand phase relations between the signals generated in each module is analyzed.\n\n1. Microwave oscillators, in which an electron beam\nwith the virtual cathode (VC) is used as an active\nmedium-the so-called vircators [1]-are promising\ndevices of relativistic electronics. The VC devices\nattract an interest of researchers first of all because they\nare characterized by simple design, high level of generated power (from hundreds of megawatt to thousands of\ngigawatt), and the possibility of controlling the device\nby an external microwave signal. The latter constitutes\nthe main condition that allows one to apply vircators as\nunits of phased arrays (see, for example, [2\u20134]). A classical scheme of sending the control signal to a vircator\nsystem is based on the assumption that the external signal influences directly upon the VC (see [3\u20135]). However, such an approach requires a high power level of\nthe control signal, which hampers practical applications of such systems. In this way, we note an array\nmodule [6] operating on the basis of the virtod-type vircator [7]. In this case, an external signal that influences\nupon the electron beam in the acceleration domain\nleads to modulation of the flow that enters the drift\nspace; according to experimental investigations of the\nmodulation of high-current electron beams [8], the\nrequired level of the control signal can be decreased by\nan order of magnitude. At the same time, it is well\nknown that a preliminary modulation of the electron\nbeam strongly influences the VC dynamics [9]. In [9], I\ndemonstrate the possibility of synchronizing oscillations in the diode gap with overcritical current and a\npreliminarily modulated electron beam at the modulation frequency; in this case, the phase difference\nbetween the control signal and the signal generated by\nthe VC oscillations tends to zero, which is an optimal\ncondition providing an increase in the output power of\na multi-module system.\nIn this paper, I present the results of numerical\ninvestigation of oscillations in a system of two coupled\nvirtod-type oscillators. Oscillation characteristics of\nthe system in the synchronization mode are of primary\ninterest; I also analyze the dependences of the frequency and phase relationships of oscillations in each\n\nmodule on the parameters of the external delayed feedback.\n2. The physical system under consideration is simulated by a set of two identical vacuum diodes; a highcurrent electron beam with the relativistic factor \u03b30 =\n3.5 is injected into the system. The beam current is\ndenoted by I1 and I2 , respectively, for the first and second diodes. Before entering the interaction space of\neach virtod, the beam is modulated in a narrow gap by\nthe electromagnetic signal taken from the interaction\nspace of another virtod; this signal is sent to the modulator with a certain delay in time. I consider a reditron\nmodel of the vircator [10]; according to this model, the\nelectrons reflected from the VC are completely fallen\nout on the anode, which prevents the accumulation of\noscillating charged particles in the cathode\u2013VC gap.\nSuch a scheme enables us to increase the signal-tonoise ratio and efficiency of the energy transformation\nas compared with the classical vircator [11, 12].\nLet us characterize the main parameters that govern\nthe system behavior: the ratio \u03b1i of the beam current Ii\nto the limit vacuum current I0 and parameters of the\nexternal feedback line that couples the moduli, namely,\nthe delay time \u03c4i and the coupling coefficient Ai that\nspecifies the modulation depth m of the electron beam\nat the exit of the modulator (at the entrance to the drift\nspace; here, i denotes the number of the virtod). In this\npaper, I assume, unless otherwise specified, that the\ncoupling between moduli is symmetric; that is, \u03c41 = \u03c42 =\n\u03c4 and A1 = A2 = A. The coupling coefficient is chosen so\nthat the modulation depth of the beam at the exit of the\nmodulator would take the value m ~ 15%.\nNumerical modeling of nonlinear time-dependent\nprocesses in the system under study was performed\nusing a standard method of \"particles in a cell\"\n(PIC-method) [13] which is usually applied for solving\nsuch problems.\nI assume that a sufficiently strong magnetic field is\napplied along the longitudinal axis z, so that the beam\n\n\f\u03c4, ps\n\napproximates the form of the particle,\nChaotic\ngeneration\n\n2100\n\n\uf8f1 1 \u2013 z \u2206z, z \u2264 \u2206z.\nS(z) = \uf8f2\n\uf8f3 0, z > \u2206z.\n\nChaotic\ngeneration\n\n1400\nQuasisynchronization\n\n700\n\nSynchronization\n\n0\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4 \u03b11/\u03b12\n\nFig. 1.

In each\nmodule, the beam is represented as a set of charged particles that are injected to the interaction space in equal\ntime intervals.

The field E = \u2013 \u2202\u03c6/\u2202z is\ndetermined, in the potential approximation, from the\nsolution of the Poisson equation for potential \u03c6 with the\nzero boundary conditions,\n\u03c1(z)\n\u2202 \u03c6\n--------2- = ----------.\n\u03b50\n\u2202z\n2\n\n(2)\n\nHere, \u03b50 is the dielectric constant.

According to the results of numerical experiment,\na system of coupled virtods demonstrates different\noperation modes depending on the parameters of the\nfeedback line. When coupling coefficient A corresponds to m < 10%, the coupling is negligible, and\noscillations in each virtod are almost autonomous. As\nthe coupling coefficient increases, the mode of chaotic\ngeneration and the mode of synchronization with the\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio in the spectrum are observed\ndepending on the frequency mismatch of the oscillator.\nThe mode of synchronization takes place when \u03b11 and\n\u03b12 are close (the frequency mismatch \u2206f = |f2 \u2013 f1| is\nsmall, where f1 and f2 are the oscillation frequencies in\nthe autonomous modes corresponding, respectively, to\n\u03b11 and \u03b12) and the modulation depth m ~ 10\u201320%.\nFigure 1 shows the zones of synchronization, quasisynchronization, and chaotic generation in the coupled\nsystem constructed for m = 15% on the plane of parameters \u03c4 and \u03b11/\u03b1.\nWe see that when the frequency mismatch of the\noscillators is small (\u2206\u03b1 < 1), the mode of synchronization in the system is observed when the signals of both\noscillators are regular and have the same frequency; the\nphase difference between these signals takes a certain\nfixed value \u2206\u03c6 that does not vary in time. When the coupling between the moduli is symmetric, the synchronization domain on the plane of parameters gets narrow\nas the delay time increases.\nThe results of numerical experiment have shown\nthat the width of the synchronization strip \u2206f strongly\ndepends on the value of coupling coefficient A. In the\nrange of A that corresponds to the modulation depth\nm ~ 10\u201315%, the width of the synchronization strip \u2206f\ncan be estimated as\nconst\n- H ( \u03c4 \u2013 \u03c4 cr ( A, \u2206\u03b1 ) ).\n\u2206 f \u223c ----------q\nA\n\n(4)\n\nHere, H(x) is the Heaviside function, q \u2248 1/2, and\n\u2206\u03b1 < 1. The behavior of the system is characterized, in\nthis case, by the presence of the threshold delay time\n\u03c4cr; when this value is exceeded, the mode of synchronization is destroyed. Note that the critical value \u03c4cr of\nthe delay time decreases when coupling coefficient A\nand mismatch \u2206\u03b1 increase.\nFor a large mismatch \u2206\u03b1 ~ 1, empirical dependence (4) is not valid, since, in this case, there exists the\nthreshold time \u03c4cr, min that limits the delay time of the\nsignal, at which regular oscillations in the system are\n\n\f(a)\n\nU, MV\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n1\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nt, ns\n\n(b)\n\n1\n\nP( f)\n\nE(t +T)\n\nP( f)\n\nE(t +T)\n\n\u2013 45\n\n\u2013 6.7\n\n\u2013 45\n\n\u2013 8.7\n\n\u2013 90\n\n0\nP( f)\n2\n\n0.03\n\nf\n\n\u2013 45\n\u2013 90\n\n\u201315.2\nE(t +T)\n\n\u2013 6.7\n\nE(t)\n\n\u2013 8.7\n\n0\nP( f)\n\n4\n\nf\n\n\u2013 45\n\u2013 90\n\n3\n\n0.03\n\n\u201313.7\nE(t +T)\n\n\u2013 8.7\n\nE(t)\n\n\u2013 9.4\n0\n\n0.03\n\nf\n\n\u201313.4\n\n\u2013 9.4\n\nE(t)\n\n\u2013 90\n\n\u201319.8\nE(t +T)\n\n\u2013 45\n\n\u201311.0\n\n\u2013 90\n\n0\n\n0.03\n\nf\n\nP( f )\n\nP( f)\n\n\u201319.3\nE(t +T)\n\n\u2013 45\n\n\u201311.4\n\n\u2013 90\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.03\n\n0.03\n\nf\n\nf\n\n\u201318.6\n\nP( f)\n\nE(t +T)\n\nP( f)\n\nE(t +T)\n\n\u2013 45\n\n\u2013 8.6\n\n\u2013 45\n\n\u201312.3\n\n\u2013 90\n\n0\n\n0.03\n\nf\n\n\u201311.8\n\n\u2013 8.6\n\nE(t)\n\n\u2013 90\n\n0\n\n0.03\n\nf\n\n\u201318.7\n\n\u2013 8.7\n\nE(t)\n\n\u2013 11.0\n\nE(t)\n\n\u2013 11.4\n\nE(t)\n\n\u2013 12.3\n\nE(t)\n\nFig. 2. Characteristics of oscillations in each oscillator determined at different moments of time during the action of the pulse of\naccelerating voltage.\n\nobserved, not only from above, but also from below. In\nthe range \u03c4cr, min < \u03c4 < \u03c4cr , the required value of the coupling coefficient that provides synchronization of oscillations must be sufficiently large (m ~ 20%).\nFigure 2 shows the characteristics of oscillations in\neach oscillator determined at different moments of time\nduring the action of the pulse of accelerating voltage\nsent to the diodes without any time shift. Figure 2a displays the pulse shape and the time intervals corresponding to the power spectra and projections of the phase\nportraits of the electric-field oscillations in the first (two\nright columns) and second (two left columns) diodes\npresented in Fig. 2b. The phase portraits were reconstructed by the method of Takens [15]. Note that the\n\ncurrent of the second diode is greater than that of the\nfirst diode.\nFigure 2 illustrates the process of establishing the\nmode of synchronization in the coupled system. In the\nbeginning of the pulse of accelerating voltage, the spectrum of the oscillation power in each virtod is close to\nthe noise spectrum [Fig. 2, (1)]. However, electrostatic\ninstability in the flow of the second diode with a large\ncurrent develops faster than in the flow of the first\ndiode. In the spectrum of the second oscillator depicted\nin Fig. 2, (1), one can follow a weakly expressed peak\n(denoted by the arrow) that occurs at the frequency of\noscillations in the autonomous diode with the same current. This leads to a deep modulation of the flow\ninjected to the first diode, in which the VC is not yet\n\n\fSynchronization frequency, GHz\n\nformed. The flow modulation in the first diode exerts a\npronounced influence on the conditions of the formation of the VC in this diode [9]. In time [Fig. 2, (2)],\nwhen the VC formation in the first diode continues (and\nits oscillation frequency is close to the generation frequency of the second diode due to the preliminarily\nmodulation of the flow), the intensity of influence on\nthe flow in the second diode increases. As a result, the\ngeneration frequency of both moduli is tuned to the\nmean frequency. The mean frequency is close to the frequency of autonomous oscillations in the second diode\nwith a large current, which is caused by the aforementioned processes that occur at the initial stage. As the\ntime increases further, the signal-to-noise ratio in the\nspectrum of the generation power of the system rises,\nthe synchronization frequency and its harmonics are\nclearly distinguished, and the noise pedestal drops to\nthe level of \u201345 dB in the domain of the first harmonic\nof the synchronization frequency and rapidly decays as\nthe frequency increases [Fig. 2, (3, 4)].\nThe duration of the transition process that leads to\nthe establishment of regular oscillations strongly\ndepends on parameters of the feedback line. If mismatch \u2206\u03b1 is sufficiently large, then, when A increases,\nthe duration of the transition process increases at small\n\u03c4 and decreases at large \u03c4. If the mismatch is small\n(\u2206\u03b1 \u0002 1), the influence of parameters of a symmetric\nexternal feedback on the system behavior is much\nweaker; however, the introduction of an asymmetry to\nthe system caused by unequal values of times \u03c41 and \u03c42\nenables one to control the phase relationships between\nthe signals in each module (see below).\nFigure 3 illustrates the dependence of the generation\nfrequency of the system on the ratio \u03b11/\u03b12 determined\nin the mode of synchronization for different \u03c4 and the\ngeneration frequency of the autonomous oscillator versus the beam current (curve 1). Here, \u03b12 = 2.2. As can\n\n1\n\n2 3\n\nConsidering the possibility of applying the system\nunder study as a module of a phased array, one should\nnote the importance of analysis of phase relationships\nbetween microwave signals in each virtod.\nFigure 4 shows the phase difference \u2206\u03c6 between the\nsignals in each virtod versus the delay time \u03c4 determined at the fixed \u03b11 = 2.2. We see that, by varying the\ndelay time \u03c4, one can readjust the phase difference in\nsufficiently broad limits; when the mismatch of oscillators is large, the influence of \u2206\u03b1 on the phase difference\nis weak. When the mismatch of oscillators is small\n(\u2206\u03b1 \u0002 1), the effect of the delay time of the symmetric\ncoupling (\u03c41 = \u03c42) on the phase difference \u2206\u03c6 is negligible (curve 2).\nIntroducing an asymmetry to the system connected\nwith different delay times \u03c41 and \u03c42 (\u03c41 \u2260 \u03c42), one can\ncontrol the value of \u2206\u03c6 in such a manner that the generation frequency remains almost unchanged. As can be\nseen from Fig. 5, a variation of the delay time \u03c42 at a\nfixed \u03c41 enables one to readjust the phase difference in\nsufficiently broad limits. For example, at \u03c41 = 14 ps, \u2206\u03c6\nvaries from 20 to 90\u00b0 with respect to \u03c42 . An increase in\nthe fixed delay time \u03c41 deteriorates the monotonic\ndependence of \u2206\u03c6 with respect to increasing \u03c42 . Note\nthat when coupling coefficient A (or the modulation\ndepth of the flow injected to the drift space, which is the\nsame) increases, the phase difference between oscilla-\n\n1\n\n4\n\n40\n\n5\n\n3.0\n\n(\u2206f/f)max ~ 20%.\n\n\u2206\u03c6, deg\n80\n\n4.0\n3.5\n\nbe seen, the introduction to the system of the external\ndelayed feedback yields a decrease in the generation\nfrequency of the coupled system as compared with the\nautonomous diode. When the duration of the delay\nincreases, the frequency decreases.

As the delay\ntime increases, the duration of the laminar phase of\noscillations shortens.\nIn the domain of quasi-synchronization, the oscillations in each module occur at one definite frequency\nand, in this case, the mutual quasi-synchronization\nbetween the moduli takes place (that is, synchronization with a small difference between the frequencies of\nthe signals generated in each module; the frequency\ndifference depends on time and oscillates close to the\nzero mean value).\nChaotic oscillations are observed in the system\nwhen the mismatch of oscillators is large (\u2206\u03b1 > 1);\nthese oscillations get complicated as the delay duration\nand mismatch \u2206\u03b1 increase. In this case, there is a high\nnoise pedestal in the spectrum of each virtod, which\nslowly decreases as the frequency increases, and\nweakly expressed peaks of the main frequency f(\u03b1i) and\nits subharmonics are observed on the background of\nnoise. The dimensionality D of the reconstructed\nattractors calculated by the Grassberger\u2013Procaccia\nalgorithm [17] strongly depend,\nTable\n\u03b11/\u03b12\n\n\u03c4, ns\n\nD\n\n0.8\n\n0.1\n0.5\n1.0\n0.1\n0.5\n1.0\n0.1\n0.5\n1.0\n\n1.01\n1.52\n2.63\n1.04\n1.11\n2.80\n1.34\n1.85\n3.62\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nas well as the phase portraits, on the system parameters.\nThe value of dimensionality D is fractional, which is\nevidence of chaotic oscillations in the system. As the\ndelay time increases, the dimensionality of the reconstructed attractors and, consequently, the oscillation\ncomplexity, increase; this effect is observed even when\nthe mismatch of the oscillators is small (see Fig. 1,\nwhere the narrowing of the synchronization domain\nthat occurs as \u03c4 increases is distinctly seen). When the\ncoupling between the moduli is asymmetric (\u03c41 \u0003 \u03c42), a\nrigid transition to the mode of chaotic oscillations\nthrough alternation takes place. One may conclude that\nan increase in the delay time yields a complication of\n\n\u2206\u03c6, deg\n100\n1\n80\n60\n\n2\n3\n\n40\n20\n0\n\u2013 20\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n\u03c42, ps\n\nFig. 5.

Note that a similar effect is\nobserved in the autonomous virtod. As is shown in [18],\nan increase in the delay time of the external delayed\nfeedback yields a transition to the mode of chaotic\noscillations in the electron beam with a VC. Thus, the\nabove analysis enables one to consider the system\nunder study operating in this mode as an oscillator of\nchaos that can be easily readjusted.\n4. The study of the system of two coupled oscillators\noperating on the basis of virtod-type VCs has demonstrated the possibility of controlling the characteristics\nof such systems by varying the parameters of the external feedback. The dependence of both the frequency\nand generation frequency band on the delay time of the\nfeedback line is observed. An asymmetric variation of\nthe delay time in the mode of synchronization makes it\npossible to readjust the phase difference between the\nsignals in each module within the limits 0\u2013\u03c0/2. Thus,\nthe results obtained enable one to consider the system\nunder study as a component of systems with a larger\nnumber of the degrees of freedom, for example, pulse\nphased arrays operating on the basis of parallel vircators.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI am grateful to V.G.
