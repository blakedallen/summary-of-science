Our protocol is based on a strategy which aims to\nprovide a more reasonable exploitation of the selected nodes\n(cluster-heads) energy. Simulation results show the effectiveness\nof LMEEC in decreasing the energy consumption, and in prolonging the network lifetime, compared to LEACH.\n\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nRecent advances in electronics and wireless communication technologies have enabled the development of miniature\nsensors at low cost. The small size of the sensors confines\nthe embedded energy because they are alimented by nonrechargeable batteries, which are even not easily replaceable.\nDue to this constraint, a lot of work has been conducted to\nmanage the sensors' energy consumption in order to extend\ntheir lifespan and thus, prolong the whole network lifetime.\nMoreover, in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), the sensed data\nis communicated through the wireless medium to the base station. This data transfer consumes most of the sensors energy.\nTherefore, several routing approaches have been proposed to\nconserve their energy [1]. Most routing protocols designed\nfor small and medium size sensor network provide good\nperformance. However, when the number of nodes increases,\ntraffic control dominates the real communication. This leads\nto an increase in latency and the explosion of routing tables.\nTo overcome these limitations, routing protocols with hierarchical topology were introduced. These protocols allow the\nreduction in the number of transmitted messages throughout\nthe network, and thus reduce the energy consumption [2], [3],\n[4]. In addition, transmission of data to the base station via a\nsingle-hop becomes impossible when the size of the network\nincreases. To resolve this issue, the multi-hop communication\nmode is used to exchange the sensed data among network\nnodes [4]. Motivated by these reasons, we propose LMEEC,\na new multi-hop energy efficient clustering protocol which\nprovides a new way to reduce the sensors energy consumption.\nIn the next section we explain how our protocol addresses\nthese challenges.\nII. LMEEC P ROTOCOL\nIn order to provide flexibility in data routing through\nthe network, LMEEC introduces a layered topology for the\n\nnetwork nodes according to the number of hops each of them\ntake to reach the base station. Thus, to achieve high energy\nefficiency and increase the network scalability, sensor nodes\nare organized into clusters. For this purpose, we define a new\nmechanism for grouping nodes into clusters. This mechanism\nensures a distribution of the workload of sensor nodes by\nstructuring them into clusters of unequal size. Then, clusterheads communicate the collected data of the network to\nthe base station. The cluster-heads are selected periodically\naccording to the weight. This weight is calculated so that\nthe number of cluster-heads increases while approaching the\nbase station. Hence, clusters farther away from the base\nstation will have smaller sizes. The execution of LMEEC\nis established periodically over three phases. The first is the\nnetwork configuration, while the second ensures the election\nof cluster-heads and cluster formation. Data communication is\nthe third phase of our protocol.\nA. The Network Configuration\nThis phase aims to organize the network nodes in layers and\ndiscover their neighbors. The neighbors' discovery is launched\nby the base station using the diffusion of the Hello messages.\nIn doing so, the neighbors at one single-hop of the base station\nwhich constitute the first layer of the network hierarchy, are\ndiscovered. Thereafter, these nodes will act as the local base\nstation for other neighboring nodes. They explore the network\nby re-broadcasting the Hello message to the other nodes within\ntheir range, while updating their information in the message.\nAt the end of this phase, each node knows its own distance to\nthe base station in terms of the number of hops.\nB. Cluster-head selection / Cluster formation\nA sensor node elects itself as a cluster-head by evaluating\na weight function Pi , and compared it to a threshold. This\nthreshold is inversely proportional to the node layer number.\nIn order to optimize energy management, this weight function\nshould help to choose the nodes with the highest energy\ncapacity, largest number of neighboring nodes, and which have\nbeen less frequently cluster-head. The strong idea behind this\nfunction is that the degree of involvement of each parameter\n\n\fvaries with the layer number of each node. The weight P of\na node i is given by:\n\nevery 0.2s. In addition, the initial battery energy that each node\nhad is set to 2J.\n2\n\nEres\nP C H = deg\n\u00d7 lnum(i)\n(2)\ni\nAt the reception of announcement message, the nodes build\nlists of cluster-heads. Each non cluster-head node determines\nits cluster by choosing the cluster-head with the greatest\nP C H weight. The cluster-head has, consequently, the highest\nenergy power and a minimum of sensors to manage. In case\nof equality, the cluster-head with a great distance far from\nthe base station is privileged. Thereafter, each node sends a\nmessage of cluster membership to the chosen cluster-head.\nThis supervised decision makes it possible to balance the load\nof cluster-heads by producing clusters with different sizes. The\nsize of a cluster decreases accordingly to layer number of\nits cluster-head : the farthest the cluster-head, the largest the\ncluster. The objective is to ensure a smaller number of nodes\nmembers and a smaller size to manage for cluster-heads of\nhigh layers close to the base station. Finally, each clusterhead have a list of his adjacent cluster-heads, which is used\nto select a relay cluster-head.\n\nC. Data Communication\nIn this phase the sensed data is collected and transmitted in\na multi-hop fashion to the base station. To ensure the intracluster communication, TDMA protocol is used. The cluster\nmember nodes transmit their sensed data during the time slots\nallocated by their cluster-head. This data is then aggregated\nby the cluster-head and sent to the relay node. Then, the\ndata transit among relay nodes until reaching the base station.\nFurthermore, the multiple access CDMA protocol is used so\nthat multiple nodes can simultaneously send their data.\nIII. P ERFORMANCE A NALYSIS\nTo evaluate the performance of our protocol, we use JSim [5], an open source simulator. Our reference comparison\nis the LEACH protocol [2]. We vary the number of sensor\nnodes from 50 to 400. These homogeneous nodes are deployed\nrandomly within a square area of 100mx100m. In each test, the\nsimulation time is set to 500s.

N is the total number of\nsensors in the network. The weighted parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3\ntake values in the interval [0, 1]. They are calculated based on\nthe layer number of node, represented by the variable Lnum(i) .\nOnce a node is auto-elected as cluster-head, he must inform\nits new role in the current cycle to the rest of the nodes. For\nthat, it broadcasts an announcement message containing its\nidentifier as well as a weight (P C H ) defined according to its\nresidual energy, its degree and its layer's number :\n\n70\n60\n50\n\n40\n30\n\n20\n10\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nTime\n\nFig. 2.\n\n9\n\n10\nx 103\n\nThe network lifetime\n\nFig. 1 shows the average dissipated energy of LMEEC\ncompared to the results obtained with LEACH. We can observe that, the increasing number of nodes deployed in the\nnetwork increases the energy consumption in both protocols.\nNevertheless, LMEEC consumes less energy; less than 10%\nof the average consumed energy (for 400 nodes for example)\ncompared to LEACH. This confirms the efficiency of load distribution policy adopted in LMEEC, by taking into account the\nenergy constraint in the selection of cluster-heads nodes and\nthe clusters formation mechanisms. Consequently, LMEEC\nstrongly increases the lifetime of the network compared to\nLEACH, as shown in Fig. 2. However, it's clear that the\nlifetime of the network decreases proportionally with the\nincrease of the number of nodes deployed in the network.\nThese results are easily explained by the increasing number\nof interference between neighboring nodes, when the number\nof nodes deployed in the network increases.\nIV. C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE WORK\nWe have shown through simulation results that LMEEC\noutperformed LEACH, in terms of energy efficiency and\nnetwork lifetime. As future work, we intend to evaluate the\ngenerated trafic in the network and study the performance of\nLMEEC in the presence of mobility.\nV.
