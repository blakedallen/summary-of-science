It\ngives rise to the non-perturbative Kondo effect in which\nthe localized electron's magnetic moment is fully screened\nby the delocalized electrons below the Kondo temperature TK . The Kondo effect was well-studied in the context of an impurity moment embedded in a bulk metal\n[1]. Recently, Kondo physics has been the subject of\nmuch renewed interest [2], following its observation in\nexperimentally tunable quantum dots [3].\nThese experimental advances have been accompanied\nby progress in the theoretical treatment of the mesoscopic\nKondo problem [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. In these mesoscopic\nsystems, either the electrons in the leads or the electrons\nin a large dot play the role of the \"electron gas\" and a\nsmall spin-1/2 dot represents the Kondo spin. Here we\nfocus on the latter case [see Fig. 1(a)], where the discrete\nsingle-particle level spacing \u03b4 and mesoscopic fluctuations\nof the large dot may alter the Kondo effect when TK \u223c \u03b4\n[5, 6, 7, 8, 9].\nA formidable challenge for both mesoscopic and bulk\nKondo theory is to take into account electron-electron\ninteractions in the electron gas. In the mesoscopic case\nthis task is simplified when the electron gas is confined\nto a large quantum dot in which the electron dynamics\nis chaotic [11, 12]. When the dot's Thouless energy ET\nis large compared with \u03b4, the effects of electron-electron\ninteraction are captured by the so-called universal Hamiltonian (UH) [13], valid in an interval ET around the dot's\nFermi energy EF . For a fixed number of electrons, the\ndominant interaction in the UH is a ferromagnetic exchange interaction. Detailed comparison between theory\nand experiment for the statistics of Coulomb blockade\npeak heights and spacings shows that including the UH\nferromagnetic exchange term is both necessary and sufficient to obtain quantitative agreement [14]. Thus, one\ncan use this UH to obtain an experimentally-relevant de-\n\nscription of a large interacting dot (henceforth called the\n\"dot\") that is Kondo-coupled to a small dot with odd\nelectron occupancy (henceforth called the \"Kondo spin\"\nSK ). Such a model was first discussed in the framework\nof a mean-field approximation [8], where Kondo correlations in a dot close to its ferromagnetic Stoner instability, Js \u223c \u03b4, were investigated. A regime just below\nthe instability was identified where the Kondo coupling\nsubstantially reduces the dot's polarization. In contrast,\nstudies in the bulk [15] found that a Kondo impurity enhances the polarization of a surrounding gas of electrons\nat similar high values of Js . \u03b4.\nThe simplicity of the UH allows one to look for signatures of the Kondo interaction in the magnetic properties of the dot without necessarily assuming that the\ndot is very close to its bulk Stoner transition (in a quantum dot, Js is typically a fraction of \u03b4 [13, 14]). Standard numerical methods for the Kondo problem such as\nquantum Monte Carlo [9] and numerical renormalization\ngroup (NRG) techniques [10] are, however, not easily ap-\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n\u03b4\n\nSd\n\nSK\n\nK\n0\n\nJs\nJk\n\n2D\n\n1\n2\n...\n\narXiv:0802.3753v1 [cond-mat.mes-hall] 26 Feb 2008\n\n2\n\nN\u22121\nFIG. 1: (Color online) (a) Schematic diagram of a small quantum dot with spin SK (Kondo spin) that is coupled antiferromagnetically (coupling constant Jk ) to a large quantum dot\nwith spin Sd . The large dot, described by the universal Hamiltonian, is characterized by a ferromagnetic exchange interaction (coupling constant Js ). We assume the large dot to have\nN equally-spaced (spacing \u03b4) single-particle levels in a band\nof width 2D (half-filling). (b) The large dot is represented in\nthe site basis (squares), in which SK couples only to site 0.\n\n\f2\nplied to this problem because the ferromagnetic exchange\ncoupling introduces a sign problem in the former and\nnon-local correlations in the latter. Here we use a customized diagonalization method that takes advantage of\nthe global spin rotation invariance, using the good-spin\neigenstates of the UH as a basis [14, 16].\nThe Hamiltonian of our system, schematically illustrated in Fig. 1, is given by [8, 13],\nX\nH=\n\u03b5\u03bc c\u2020\u03bc\u03c3 c\u03bc\u03c3 \u2212Js S2d +Jk SK * sd (0) .\n(1)\n\u03bc,\u03c3=\u00b1\n\nThe first two terms in (1) constitute the UH of the dot\n[13] (ignoring a constant charging energy and a Cooper\nchannel term), described by N spin-degenerate\nsingleP\nparticle levels \u03b5\u03bc and spin S d = 12 \u03bc\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 c\u2020\u03bc\u03c3 \u03c4 \u03c3\u03c3\u2032 c\u03bc\u03c3\u2032\n(\u03c4 are Pauli matrices). The coupling of the dot to the\nKondo spin S K (withP\nSK = 1/2) is mediated by its\nspin density sd (0) = 12 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 \u03c6\u03bc (0)c\u2020\u03bc\u03c3 \u03c4 \u03c3\u03c3\u2032 \u03c6\u2217\u03bd (0)c\u03bd\u03c3\u2032 at\nthe tunneling position r = 0 [\u03c6\u03bc (r) is the orbital wave\nfunction of level \u03bc]. The parameters Js and Jk are the\nexchange and Kondo coupling constants, respectively.\nIn this study we ignore mesoscopic fluctuations, taking\nequally spaced single-particle levels [covering\n\u221a a band of\nwidth 2D = (N \u2212 1) \u00d7 \u03b4] and \u03c6\u03bc (0) = 1/ N . We also\nassume half-filling of the band so that the number of dot\nelectrons is N . The average local density of states of the\ndot is \u03c1 = 1/(N \u03b4) [7].\nThe spin-rotation invariance of the Hamiltonian (1)\nimplies the conservation of the total spin Stot = Sd + SK ,\nz\nso that Stot and Stot\n= Mtot are good quantum numbers. To take advantage of this symmetry, we construct\na good total spin basis by coupling the eigenstates of\nthe UH with those of the Kondo spin. The UH eigenstates with dot spin Sd are characterized by |\u03b3Sd Md i (\u03b3\ndenotes orbital occupations n\u03bc and other quantum numbers distinguishing between states of the same dot spin\nSd ). Thus a basis of the coupled system with good total\nspin is |\u03b3Sd Stot Mtot i (for simplicity the quantum number\nSK = 1/2 is omitted).\nIn this basis the UH is diagonal\nP\nwith energies \u03bc \u01eb\u03bc n\u03bc \u2212Js Sd (Sd + 1). The Kondo term\nHK = Jk SK * sd (0) is a scalar product of vector operators in the uncoupled spaces. Thus, its matrix elements\nin the coupled basis conserve Stot , Mtot and are given by\nh\u03b3 \u2032 Sd\u2032 Stot Mtot |HK |\u03b3Sd Stot Mtot i = Jk (\u22121)Sd +1/2+Stot\nr \u001a\n\u001b\n3\nSd\u2032\n1 Sd\n(\u03b3 \u2032 Sd\u2032 k sd (0) k \u03b3Sd ) , (2)\n\u00d7\n2 1/2 Stot 1/2\nin terms of a Wigner-6j symbol and the reduced matrix\nelement of the spin density sd (0) (known in closed form\n[16]). In this formulation, the full Hamiltonian H has a\nblock diagonal structure in Stot , Mtot .\nThe problem is further simplified by transforming to\nthe basis of sites i (0 \u2264 i \u2264 N \u2212 1), in which the onebody part of the dot's Hamiltonian is tridiagonal and\n\nHK = Jk SK * s0 with si the spin at site i [1] (see Fig. 1b).\nThe exchange interaction is invariant under such transformation and has the same form as in Eq. (1) with\nPN \u22121\nSd = i=0 si . We can thus recast our formalism in this\nsite basis, where only neighboring sites are coupled and\nthe Kondo spin interacts solely with site 0. Due to these\nfeatures the many-body Hamiltonian matrix in the site\nbasis is more sparse than in the orbital basis, allowing\nfor an efficient diagonalization in each subspace of good\nStot using a Lanczos-Arnoldi algorithm. In this approach\nwe can conveniently diagonalize (1) for dots with up to\nN \u223c 12 levels, where the total Hilbert space contains\n\u223c 5.4 \u00d7 106 basis states.\nWe calculated the lowest many-body energy eigenvalue\nfor each value of Stot and thereby determined the groundstate value of the total spin for different values of Js\nand Jk . This quantity has been studied theoretically\n[8, 9] and can be probed experimentally [17]. As Js increases, the ground state spin Stot is expected to undergo successive transitions to higher values (known as\nthe Stoner staircase) until the dot becomes fully polarized at Js \u223c \u03b4. For Jk \u2192 0, the spin transitions occur at Jsm = \u03b4(m + 1)/(m + 2), with m = 1, 3, 5, . . .\n(m = 2, 4, 6, . . . ) for an odd (even) number of dot electrons N . These transition steps in the Stoner staircase are shifted by the Kondo interaction. In Fig. 2a,b\nwe show the transition curves (colored lines) separating regions of fixed ground-state spin Stot in the twodimensional parameter space of Js , Jk . We observe that\nthese curves are monotonically decreasing for Jk \u03c1 . 1\nand monotonically increasing for Jk \u03c1 & 1. In the strongcoupling limit, they converge to values of Js that are\neither lower (for smaller Stot ) or higher (for larger Stot )\nthan their corresponding weak-coupling values Jsm .\nTo gain insight into the behavior of the transition\ncurves, we evaluate them for weak Kondo coupling in\nfirst-order (degenerate) perturbation theory. We find\nJsm = [(m + 1)\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b1m Jk ]/[m + 2] ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b1m are positive constants of order one. These\nperturbative results (dotted lines in Fig. 2a,b) agree well\nwith the numerical calculations for Jk \u03c1 . 0.1.\nThe negative slope of the transition curves at weak\ncoupling can be understood by considering that in this\nweak-coupling regime the Kondo spin SK plays the role\nof an effective magnetic field, polarizing the dot in the\ndirection opposite to its own spin. This will favor larger\nvalues of Sd and thus also larger values of Stot , hence the\nnegative slope. As we approach the Stoner instability\nJs \u2192 \u03b4, (i.e., increasing m), the gain in exchange correlations Js Sd (Sd + 1) dominates over the gain in Kondo\ncorrelations, hence the flattening of the slope in this limit.\nA perturbative analysis can also be carried out for the\nlimit of strong Kondo coupling, which, at zero temperature, is characterized by TK \u226b \u03b4.

The latter condition represents the bare strong-coupling limit for which a\nperturbative solution is available (without renormalizing\nthe band width) [18]. In this limit the Kondo spin SK\nand the spin s0 at site 0 form a strongly bound singlet\nSK,0 = 0 (SK,0 = SK + s0 ) that is effectively decoupled\nfrom the rest of the spin-chain with sites i \u2265 1. The\ntridiagonal one-body Hamiltonian\nP of sites 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N \u2212 1\ncan be rediagonalized to give \u03bc\u03c3 \u03b5\u0304\u03bc c\u0304\u2020\u03bc\u03c3 c\u0304\u03bc\u03c3 , describing a\n\"reduced\" dot with new orbital wave functions \u03c6\u0304\u03bc (r) and\nsingle-particle energies \u03b5\u0304\u03bc . This dot has one less level and\none less electron than the original dot. While the original dot levels are equally spaced, the level spacings in the\nreduced dot are given by \u03b5\u0304\u03bc+1 \u2212 \u03b5\u0304\u03bc \u2261 \u03b4\u03bc \u2248 \u03b4 + \u03b2\u03bc /N > \u03b4,\n(\u03b2\u03bc > 0 are of order 1 and increase monotonically from\nthe new band center towards the band edges).\nTo explore how the strong-coupling limit is modified\nin the presence of exchange interaction in the dot, we\nrewrite the latter as \u2212Js S2d = \u2212Js S\u03042d \u2212 2Js s0 * S\u0304d \u2212 3Js /4\n\nPN \u22121\nwhere S\u0304d = i=1 si is the spin of the reduced dot. The\ncross term \u22122Js s0 * S\u0304d has vanishing matrix elements in\nthe singlet subspace SK,0 = 0 but induces virtual transitions to the triplet subspace SK,0 = 1 that renormalize\nthe exchange coupling constant Js \u2192 J \u0304s = Js (1 + Js /Jk )\n(details will be presented elsewhere). To lowest order in\n1/Jk , our\nP system is thus described by an effective Hamiltonian \u03bc\u03c3 \u03b5\u0304\u03bc c\u0304\u2020\u03bc\u03c3 c\u0304\u03bc\u03c3 \u2212J \u0304s S\u03042d that has the form of a UH for\nthe reduced dot with single-particle energies \u03b5\u0304\u03bc and exchange constant J \u0304s (J \u0304s \u2192 Js for Jk \u2192 \u221e). The spin transition curves of this reduced dot (dotted lines in Fig. 2a,b)\nare found to be in good agreement with the exact numerical curves when Jk \u03c1 \u226b 1. Despite their accuracy in the\nappropriate limits, the perturbative estimates do fail in\nthe fully Kondo correlated intermediate regime and our\nexact numerical solutions are essential to show that there\nis a smooth crossover between the limits.\nThe spin transition curves in the crossover from weak\nto strong coupling (see Fig. 2) are determined by two\ncounteracting effects: (i) The effective removal of an electron from the dot shifts down the Stoner staircase according to Jsm \u2192 Jsm\u22121 . Since the reduced dot has one less\nelectron, the shifted Stoner staircase is associated with\nthe opposite number parity of electrons. (ii) The effective\nremoval of a level from the dot stretches the step size in\nthe staircase due to the larger level spacing in the reduced\ndot (i.e., \u03b4\u03bc > \u03b4), and thus increases the spin-transition\nvalues of Js . The downward shift in (i) is independent\nof N , but weakens for increasing m (where the step values Jsm are more densely spaced). The upward shift in\n(ii) is a finite-size correction \u223c 1/N that decreases with\nN , but increases with m because of the non-uniform \u03b4\u03bc .\nFor smaller values of Js , effect (i) dominates over (ii),\nresulting in an overall downward shift of the transition\nvalues in the strong-coupling limit (as compared to the\nweak-coupling values Jsm ). Close to the Stoner instability, however, finite-size effects (ii) dominate over (i),\nleading to transition values larger than Jsm .\nTo investigate the interplay between effects (i) and (ii)\nmore closely, we compare the spin transition curves of our\noriginal systems (N = 11, 12) with systems of equal band\nwidth 2D, but different values of N . Results shown in\nFig. 2c,d demonstrate that finite-size effects (ii) decrease\nwith increasing N , leading to a convergence of the strong\ncoupling transition curves towards Jsm\u22121 .\nDots with a large band width (D \u226b \u03b4) could, in principle, be studied by extending the NRG method to include\nan exchange interaction. Truncation of the band width\nbelow TK leads to a strong-coupling effective Hamiltonian that includes additional interaction terms. It would\nbe interesting to investigate the effects of these terms.\nSignatures of the interplay between the intra-dot exchange and the Kondo coupling are revealed by applying\nz\nan in-plane field B [17], adding a Zeeman term g\u03bcB B Stot\nto the Hamiltonian H in Eq. (1) (g is the gyromagnetic\nfactor and \u03bcB the Bohr magneton). This term commutes\n\n\f4\nwith H (although it breaks the Mtot degeneracy) and favors a parallel configuration of dot spin (\u2191) and Kondo\nspin (\u21d1), increasing Stot at Jk = 0. The addition of\nthe Kondo interaction opposes such a parallel alignment\n(\u2191\u21d1); correspondingly we find (Fig. 3a) the spin transition values of B monotonically increasing vs. Jk . A\nmore complex and subtle behavior appears for Js 6= 0\n(see Fig. 3b), where non-monotonic spin-transition curves\narise. The behavior in weak Kondo coupling can again\nbe understood in perturbation theory, for which the dot\nspin can still be regarded as a good quantum number.\nIn the limit Jk \u2192 0 the ground state will always be\nthe parallel configuration (\u2191\u21d1) aligned with the external field, so that the spin transition lines slowly increase\nwith Jk (as for Js = 0). At larger values of Jk the energy of the anti-parallel (\u2193\u21d1) configuration (with rearranged orbital occupancies) becomes lower in each spin\nsubspace. This happens at lower Jk for the lower value\nof Stot , leading first to a marked increase in the slope\nof the transition line. Increasing Jk further one reaches\nthe point at which the anti-parallel configuration is also\nfavored in the subspace with higher Stot . This decreases\nthe slope of the spin transition line, making it negative in\nsome cases. For even larger Jk the perturbative picture\nbreaks down and the transition curves make a smooth\ncrossover to the strong coupling picture where the effective exchange interaction constant J \u0304s now decreases\nwith increasing Jk , favoring lower Stot again and giving\na positive slope to the transition curves. Initial calculations with non-uniformly spaced single-particle levels\nshow that such a non-monotonic behavior persists in individual dots. We defer detailed studies of mesoscopic\nfluctuations to future work.\nThe ground state spin of quantum dots (in the absence\nof Kondo coupling) has been measured in a number of\nexperiments [17]; typically this requires varying the inplane (Zeeman) field B, allowing us to map out the spin\ntransition diagram in the following manner. The points\nof degeneracy between ground states with different spin\nfor fixed Jk are determinable by kinks in the slope of\nthe Coulomb blockade peak positions vs. in-plane field B\n[19]. Tuning Jk (by means of a pinch-off gate) at fixed\nJs will cause the kinks to shift to higher or lower values\nof B in a manner predictable from our calculations.\nIn summary, the interplay of Kondo and ferromagnetic\n(Stoner) interactions in large quantum dots leads to interesting ground state spin properties. The transitions to\nhigher spin ground states due to the Stoner interaction\nare shifted non-monotonically in the presence of a Kondo\nspin. At weak Kondo coupling the Kondo spin acts just\nas an external field to assist ferromagnetic polarization.\nAt strong coupling the system is described (again) by a\nuniversal Hamiltonian, but with a renormalized exchange\nconstant for a reduced dot with one less level and one less\nelectron. Ferromagnetic polarization can be either enhanced or reduced in this limit, depending on how close\n\n(a) g\u03bc \u0392/\u03b4\n\u0392\n\ng\u03bc\u0392\u0392/\u03b4\n12\n\n13/2\n\n13/2\n11/2\n\n8\n\n1\n\n9/2\n7/2\n\n4\n\n0.5\n\n5/2\n\n11/2\n9/2\n7/2\n\n3/2\n0\n0.01\n\n(b)\n\nStot=1/2\n0.1\n\n1\n\nJk\u03c1\n\n0\n0.01\n\nStot=5/2\n0.1\n\n1\n\nJk\u03c1\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Spin transition curves for N = 12 at\nZeeman field B and Kondo coupling Jk .
