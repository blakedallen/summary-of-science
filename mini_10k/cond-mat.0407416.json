The study is motivated by a recent\nproposal for a non-ballistic spin field effect transistor that utilizes the interplay between\nthe Rashba and the Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction in the device channel. The model,\nwhich utilizes real material parameters, in order to calculate spin dynamics as a function\nof the gate voltage has been developed. From the obtained results we define the\nefficiency of the spin polarization and spin density modulation. The estimated modulation\nof the spin polarization at room temperature is of the order of 15-20%. The results show\nthat the effect is not sufficient for device applications. However, it can be observed\nexperimentally by optical pulse-probe techniques.\n\n\fSuccessful applications utilizing giant magnetoresistance and tunneling\nmagnetoresistance effects in layered ferromagnetic-metal structures for commercial\ndevices [1] have motivated large interest in spin dependent phenomena in semiconductor\nstructures [2,3]. In comparison with metal based structures, semiconductor spintronic\ndevices are belief to be compatible with conventional circuits and more flexible in\nfunctionality. Many semiconductor spin electronic (spintronic) devices have been\nproposed recently [4-14]. The optimistic expectation is that such devices could be\nscalable to smaller sizes, dissipate less power in comparison to conventional devices and\nin addition utilize the property of spin quantum coherence [15-17]. According to a more\nskeptic estimation semiconductor spintronic devices will be limited only to specific\napplications [18,19]. In order to clarify this controversy the functionality of the various\nproposed device structures should be analyzed.\nWe have estimated the efficiency of the gate voltage control over the spin\npolarization in a channel of a non-ballistic spintronic field effect transistor (spin-FET)\n[10] at room temperature utilizing realistic material parameters. This spin-FET should be\nstable to effects of electron scattering, in contrast to other spintronic devices that operate\nin a ballistic transport regime. It utilizes spin relaxation of conduction electrons in III-V\nor II-VI semiconductor quantum wells (QW) modulated by the gate voltage [10]. In such\nstructures the spin dynamics of the conduction electrons is controlled by the spin-orbit\ninteraction [20,21]. Two different spin-orbit terms are present in zincblende\nsemiconductor heterostructures, Rashba term [20]\nH R = \u03b7 ( k y \u03c3 x \u2212 k x\u03c3 y ) ,\n(1)\n\nand Dresselhaus term [22]\nH D = \u03b3 ( k y \u03c3 y \u2212 k x\u03c3 x ) .\n\n(2)\n\nThe interplay between these terms makes the spin relaxation strongly anisotropic [23]. It\nwas shown theoretically that for some particular configurations spin polarized electrons\ncan be transported without substantial loss of polarization if the spin-orbit coupling\nconstants \u03b7 and \u03b3 are nearly equal [10, 24]. The external gate voltage controls the\ndifference between the Rashba and Dresselhaus terms (mostly through the variation of\nthe Rashba term [26,27]). As a result, it produces a different spin polarization at the drain\ncontact. The spin-dependent filtering of the ferromagnetic drain contact [4] converts the\nspin polarized current to charge current.\nIn this study we have addressed the issue of spin polarization and spin density\nmodulation by controlling the gate voltage, without taking into account the issues of\ninjection and filtering. It should be noted that recent experimental advances allow\nefficient electrical spin injection [28] and spin detection [29] at room temperature.\nThe structure considered in this work is shown in Fig. 1. We have assumed that the\nthermalized spin polarized electrons are injected into the QW at the left boundary, x = 0.\n\n\fThe device channel (x axis) is oriented along the (1 -1 0) crystallographic direction and\ninitial spin polarization is parallel to (-1 1 0) direction. Within a drift-diffusion\napproximation [25,30] the electron spin density at a given position x will be [25]\n\u2212 x / Ls\nns ( x ) = ns (0)e\n.\n(3)\nThe characteristic spin dephasing length, Ls, is defined as\n\uf8eb\n\u03bcE\nLs = \uf8ec\n+\n\uf8ec 2D\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\u03bc E \uf8f6\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\n2 D \uf8f7\uf8f8\n\n2\n\n\u22121\n\n2 \uf8f6\n2m* (\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b3 ) \uf8f6\uf8f7 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n+\n,\n\uf8f7 \uf8f7\n=2\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f8\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n(4)\n\nwhere E is the in-plane electric field, \u03bc is the electron mobility and D is the diffusion\ncoefficient. Within this model [25], spin polarization is conserved along the channel if the\nspin-orbit coupling constants are equal and the electric field is negative. On the other\nhand, it decays exponentially if they are different. The effect of a finite electric field in\nEq. (4) is accounted similarly to [31].\nA simulation model has been developed based on [32] to compute the properties of\nthe heterostrucutre shown in Fig.1. The algorithm consists of coupled macroscopic and\nmicroscopic models. The macroscopic model which includes the transport and continuity\nequations is solved iteratively with Poisson equation to get the self-consistent electron\nconcentration and electric potential in the whole device. The total number of electrons in\nthe QW is obtained from the concentration distribution. To take into account the quantum\neffect of the QW, the microscopic model, Schr\u00f6dinger equation, is solved selfconsistently with Poisson equation. It refines the distribution of the concentrations in\nsubbands and the potential in the region of the device where the quantum mechanical\neffects take place (QW width plus 5nm in both sides out of the QW). The exact form of\nthe energy band diagram of the heterointerface is based on the Anderson model [33,34].\nThe resulting electric potential distribution, conduction band profile, subband energies\nand confined electron wavefunctions are used to calculate the Rashba and the\nDresselhaus terms as functions of the gate voltage and device structure.\nIn the simulation, the gate-semiconductor interface was assumed to be a Schottky\nbarrier contact and the substrate interface was assumed to be an ohmic contact. The\nboundary conditions of the device are represented by the voltage and the concentration,\nwhich were calculated using the equations from [35]. The Schottky barrier height,\n\u03c6B = 1.06 eV, was obtained from experimental data [36]. In the QW region the three\nlowest subbands were accounted. Profiles of doping density and material composition are\nassumed to vary only in one dimension. Effects of the crystal potential were\nparameterized by an effective mass, which is constant in each material region, and which\nchanges abruptly at the material interface. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation, solved for the\nelectrons confined in the QW, is spin independent. That is applicable for middle gap\nsemiconductor structures [37].\n\n\fGate\n\nSource\n\nSchottky Layer\n\nAlxGa1-xAs\n\nn=1\u00d71016 (cm-3)\n\n20nm\n\nCarrier Supply Layer\n\nAlxGa1-xAs\n\nn=1\u00d71018 (cm-3)\n\nSpacer Layer\n\nAlxGa1-xAs\n\nUndoped\n\n7nm\n6nm\n\nChannel Layer\n\nGaAs\n\nn=1\u00d71014 (cm-3)\n\nSubstrate Layer\n\nAlxGa1-xAs\n\nUndoped\n\nZ\n\nDrain 20nm\n\n47nm\n\nX\n0.5 \u03bcm\nFig. 1. Schematic diagram of the structure simulated, x = 0.3.\n\nWe have calculated the spin orbit coefficients for two cases. The first case (Case I) is\nbased on the simplified equations, \u03b7 = \u03b1E (Rashba constant is independent on the\n2\n\nsubband index i) and \u03b3 i = \u03b2 k zi , where, \u03b1 = 5.33 eV\u00c52 and \u03b2 = 29 eV\u00c53 were fitted to\nthe experimental data [27]. E is the average electric field in the QW region and k zi\n\n2\n\nis\n\nthe expectation value of the wave vector squared. In the second case (Case II) we used\nthe model developed by W. Zawadzki and P. Pfeffer [37]. The utilized constants were\nE0 (GaAs) = \u22121.424 eV,\nE0 ( AlGaAs) = \u22121.798 eV,\n\u2206 0 (GaAs) = \u22120.34 eV,\n\u2206 0 ( AlGaAs) = \u22120.328 eV [38],\n\nE1 (GaAs) = 3.04 eV,\n\nE1 (AlGaAs) = 2.693 eV [39],\n\nP0 = 10.493 eV\u00c5, P1 = 4.780 eV\u00c5, Q = 8.165 eV\u00c5, \u2206 = \u22120.050 eV [40].\n\nThe calculated spin-orbit coupling coefficients, presented in the Fig. 2, are compatible\nwith the results of experimental measurements and theoretical calculations [26,27,41-43].\nAccording to Case I, Fig 2a, at Vg= 0.8 V the Rashba and Dresselhaus coefficient are\nequal. In Case II, Fig 2b, this occurs at a higher gate voltage that was out of the studied\nrange.\nIt can be seen from the results in Fig. 2b that the Rashba coefficient is linear and\nnearly the same for all the subbands. In both cases \u03b7 = 0 at Vg= 0.42V, where the QW is\nsymmetric. The slope of \u03b3 i in both figures can be explained as the effect of the electric\nfield on k z . It is more pronounced in the lowest subband, which is highly sensitive to the\nconduction band variations.\n\n\fFig. 2. Rashba,\n\n\u03b7i\n\n, and Dresselhaus,\n\n\u03b3 i , spin-orbit coupling coefficients as a function of the gate voltage.\n\nIndexes correspond to different subbands. (a) Case I \u2013 phenomenological parameters fitted to experimental\ndata [27], (b) Case II \u2013 parameters calculated according to [37].\n\nIt can be deduced from the results that it will not be possible to control electron spin\ndynamics over all subbands simultaneously. Hence, in order to achieve a bigger spin\nmodulation, the majority of the electrons should be transported on the first subband. This\ncorresponds to the conclusions by [44].\n\n\fTo characterize the efficiency of the spin density modulation we introduce the ratio\nbetween spin densities at the drain contact, x = a, for two different values of gate voltages\n\n\u2211 n ( a ,V\n\u0393=\n\u2211 n ( a ,V\ni\ns\n\noff\ng\n\n)\n\ni\ns\n\non\ng\n\n)\n\ni\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\ni\n\noff\ng\n\nV\n\non\ng\n\nand V\n\ncorrespond to \"off\" and \"on\" states of the spin-FET and i is the subband\n\nindex. The parameter \u0393 in Eq. (5) characterizes two different processes. The first is the\nconventional charge manipulation as in FET. The second is the modulation of the spin\npolarization, P = n\u03c3 / n . Equation\n\u039b P = 1 \u2212 \u0393 / \u0393n\n\n(6)\n\ndefines the range of the spin polarization variation. In the same form as (5) we define \u0393n\nas the ratio between the average electron charge concentrations, n i ( a , Vgoff ) and\nn i ( a ,Vgon ) .\n\nTo estimate the parameters \u0393 and \u039bP the in-plane electric filed is specified as\nE = \u2212105 V/m. The \"on\" and \"off\" states of the gate voltage are defined as Vgon = 0.4 V\nand Vgoff = 0.3 V respectively. The device length and the applied voltage range\ncorrespond to trends in semiconductor devices [45]. The calculated values, Table I, show\nthat the efficiency of the gate modulation is not sufficient for a device application.\nHowever, variation of spin polarization can be observed experimentally at room\ntemperature using optical measurement techniques [46].\nSimilar results for \u039bP were obtained for an inverted structure, in which the QW is\nlocated between the gate contact and carrier supply layer.\nTable 1.

We have studied the effects of the gate voltage on spin relaxation in a\nspin-FET device using realistic parameters. The spin dynamics in the structure is\ngoverned by the spin orbit interaction. The calculations of the spin-orbit coupling\ncoefficients for a given device structure and gate voltage are based on the self-consistent\n\n\fsteady state solution of the Poisson and Schr\u00f6dinger equations coupled with the transport\nand continuity equations.\nWe have shown that it is possible to control electron spin relaxation in a quantum\nwell by the gate voltage at room temperature. The calculated range of the spin\npolarization modulation for the \"on\" and \"off\" states is approximately \u039bP =15-20%. The\neffect can be measured using optical pulse-probe techniques. In order to make it\napplicable for commercial devices further improvements of the structure design should\nare required.\nAcknowledgements.
