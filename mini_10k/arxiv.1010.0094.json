Let H0 be\na non-negative self-adjoint operator acting on L2 (X, dx). We assume that H0\nhas discrete spectrum {\u03bbn }\u221e\nn=1 , where the eigenvalues are written in increasing\norder and repeated according to multiplicity, and that its smallest eigenvalue\n\u03bb1 = 0 has multiplicity 1 with corresponding eigenfunction \u03c61 = |X|\u22121/2 ,\nwhere |X| is the volume of X. Given a bounded real potential V on X, we\nput H = H0 + V , so that H also has discrete spectrum, which we denote by\n{\u03bcn }\u221e\nn=1 . The problem is to write down a general list of abstract conditions on\nH0 which imply that if H and H0 have the same spectrum, taking multiplicities\ninto account, then V is identically zero.\nThe classical theorem of Ambarzumyan solved this problem when X = [a, b]\n2\nand H0 f = \u2212 ddxf2 , subject to Neumann boundary conditions at a and b, [1].\nThe result is also known for periodic boundary conditions, but the corresponding result for Dirichlet boundary conditions is false; the best known inverse\nspectral theorem in this context depends on knowing the spectrum of H for\n1\n\n\ftwo different sets of boundary conditions at a, b, [2]. Ambarzumyan's theorem has been extended to trees with a finite number of edges, [4, 14, 12], by\ncombining the Sturm-Liouville theory with a careful boundary value analysis.\nThe present paper extends it to a much broader context by adapting a range\nof classical techniques from the theory of the heat equation in several dimensions. Theorem 7, establishes that If \u03bc1 \u2265 0 and lim supn\u2192\u221e (\u03bcn \u2212 \u03bbn ) \u2264 0\nthen V = 0, subject to certain generic conditions on the heat kernels involved.\nThis theorem can be applied to arbitrary compact Riemannian manifolds, compact quantum graphs and finite combinatorial graphs, subject to Neumann (or\nKirchhoff) boundary conditions. Our proof depends on a list of abstract hypotheses that are known to be satisfied in a wide variety of situations. The\nhypotheses are by no means the weakest possible; the strategy of our proof is\nmore important than the detailed assumptions, and can be adapted to other\ncases.\nThe material in Sections 2 and 3 is of a general character, and the reader may\nprefer to start in Section 4. In Section 5 we prove that all of the hypotheses\nhold for a finite connected quantum graph X, subject to Kirchhoff boundary\nconditions at every vertex.\nBefore proceeding, I should like to thank Professor Chun-Kong Law for a very\nstimulating lecture in the Isaac Newton Institute in July 2010, where the author\nlearned about this problem.\n\n2\n\nProperties of H0\n\nWe start by listing the hypotheses that will be used in the proofs.\n(H1) The operator e\u2212H0 t has a non-negative integral kernel K0 (t, x, y) for\nt > 0, which is continuous on (0, \u221e) \u00d7 X \u00d7 X.\n(H2) There exist constants c > 0 and d > 0 such that 0 \u2264 K0 (t, x, x) \u2264 ct\u2212d/2\nfor all t \u2208 (0, 1).\n(H3) There exists a constant a > 0 such that limt\u21920 td/2 K0 (t, x, x) = a for all\nx\u2208\n/ N, where N is a set of zero measure.\n(H4) The smallest eigenvalue \u03bb1 of the operator H0 equals 0 and has multiplicity 1. The corresponding eigenfunction is \u03c61 = |X|\u22121/2 .\nWe do not assume that H0 is a second order elliptic differential operator, because we wish to allow other possibilities. For example H0 could be a fractional\n2\n\n\fpower of a Laplacian. The case in which H0 is a discrete Laplacian on l2 (X)\nfor some finite set X is discussed in Example 8. The conditions (H1) to (H4)\nhave been examined in some detail in [6], from which we quote the following\nconsequences of (H1) and (H4).\n1/2\n\nThe quadratic form defined on Quad(H0 ) = Dom(H0 ) by\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\nQ0 (f ) = hH0 f, H0 f i\nis a Dirichlet form; see [6, Theorem 1.3.2]. The one-parameter semigroup Tt =\ne\u2212H0 t on L2 (X, dx) is an irreducible symmetric Markov semigroup. It extends\nto a one-parameter contraction semigroup on Lp (X, dx) for all 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e,\nwith the proviso that for p = \u221e the semigroup is not strongly continuous; see\n[6, Prop. 1.4.3]. Mercer's theorem, [10, Prop. 5.6.9], implies that the operator\ne\u2212H0 t is trace class for all t > 0 and\nZ\n\u2212H0 t\ntr[e\n]=\nK0 (t, x, x) dx.\nX\n\nIn particular\n\n\u221e\nX\n\ne\u2212\u03bbn t < \u221e\n\nn=1\n\n{\u03bbn }\u221e\nn=1\n\nfor all t > 0, where\nare the eigenvalues of H0 written in increasing\norder and repeated according to multiplicities. If \u03c6n are the corresponding\nnormalized eigenfunctions then by applying the formula\nZ\n\u2212\u03bbn t\ne\n\u03c6n (x) =\nK0 (t, x, y)\u03c6n (y) dy\nX\n\nwe deduce that every eigenfunction \u03c6n is bounded and continuous on X. The\nsemigroup Tt is ultracontractive in the sense of [6, Section 2.1] and the series\nK0 (t, x, y) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\ne\u2212\u03bbn t \u03c6n (x)\u03c6n (y)\n\nn=1\n\nconverges uniformly on [\u03b1, \u221e) \u00d7 X \u00d7 X for every \u03b1 > 0; see [6, Theorem 2.1.4].\nThis implies that K0 (t, x, y) converges uniformly to |X|\u22121 on X \u00d7 X as t \u2192 \u221e,\nso\n1\n3\n\u2264 K0 (t, x, y) \u2264\n(1)\n2|X|\n2|X|\nfor all large enough t > 0.\nThe condition (H2) is much more specific, but necessary and sufficient conditions for its validity are now classical.\n3\n\n\fProposition 1 Let H be a self-adjoint operator acting in L2 (X, dx). If H is\nbounded below and e\u2212Ht is positivity preserving for all t \u2265 0 then the following\nare equivalent, the constant d > 0 being the same in all cases.\n1. The operator e\u2212Ht satisfies\nke\u2212Ht f k\u221e \u2264 c1 t\u2212d/4 kf k2\nfor some c1 > 0, all f \u2208 L2 (X, dx) and all t \u2208 (0, 1).\n2. The bound\nZ\n\nX\n\nf 2 log(f )dx \u2264 \u03b5Q(f ) + \u03b2(\u03b5)kf k22 + kf k22 log(kf k2 )\n\nholds for all 0 \u2264 f \u2208 Quad(H) \u2229 L1 \u2229 L\u221e and all \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1), where\n\u03b2(\u03b5) = c2 \u2212 (d/4) log(\u03b5) for some c2 > 0. See [6, Example 2.3.3].\n3. The bound\n\n2+4/d\n\nkf k2\n\n\u0001\n4/d\n\u2264 c3 Q(f ) + kf k22 kf k1\n\nholds for some c3 > 0 and all 0 \u2264 f \u2208 Quad(H) \u2229 L1 . See [6, Corollary 2.4.7].\n4. Assuming d > 2, the bound\nkf k22d/(d\u22122) \u2264 c4 Q(f ) + kf k22\n\n\u0001\n\nholds for some c4 > 0 and all f \u2208 Quad(H). See [6, Corollary 2.4.3].\nAll of the above conditions imply that e\u2212Ht has a measurable heat kernel K that\nsatisfies\n0 \u2264 K(t, x, y) \u2264 c5 t\u2212d/2\n(2)\nfor some c5 > 0, almost all x, y \u2208 X and all t \u2208 (0, 1). Conversely, if\nke\u2212Ht kL\u221e \u2192L\u221e \u2264 c6 for all t \u2208 (0, 1) then (2) implies the previous conditions.\nSee [6, Lemma 2.1.2].\nAn important feature of all these conditions is that they depend on the quadratic\nform Q and can therefore be transferred from one operator to another if the\nquadratic forms are comparable.\n2\n\nd\n2\nExample 2 Let H0 = \u2212 dx\n2 act in L ((0, \u221e), dx) subject to Neumann boundary conditions at 0. Then\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\n2\nK0 (t, x, y) = (4\u03c0t)\u22121/2 e\u2212(x\u2212y) /(4t) + e\u2212(x+y) /(4t)\n\n4\n\n\fso\n0 \u2264 K0 (t, x, y) \u2264 2(4\u03c0t)\u22121/2\nfor all t > 0 and x, y \u2208 (0, \u221e). Moreover\nlim(4\u03c0t)\nt\u21920\n\n1/2\n\nK0 (t, x, x) =\n\n\u001a\n\n1\n2\n\nif x > 0,\nif x = 0.\n\nThis explains the need for an exceptional set of zero measure in (H3).\nn\nOne may also solve the corresponding example in RN\n+ = (0, \u221e) subject to\nNeumann boundary conditions on the boundary. In this case the possible\nvalues of limt\u21920 (4\u03c0t)1/2 K0 (t, x, x) are the integers 2r where 0 \u2264 r \u2264 n. A\nrelated result for general convex sets is given in [9, Theorem 12].\n\u0003\n\n3\n\nProperties of H = H0 + V\n\nGiven a self-adjoint operator H0 satisfying the hypotheses (H1) to (H4), we\nput H = H0 + V where V is a bounded real-valued potential; this condition\ncan surely be weakened. An application of the Trotter product formula or a\nperturbation expansion imply that\nke\u2212Ht kLp \u2192Lp \u2264 ekV k\u221e t\nfor all p \u2208 [1, \u221e] and t \u2265 0. By using standard variational methods one\nsees that H has discrete spectrum and that its eigenvalues {\u03bcn }\u221e\nn=1 , written in\nincreasing order and repeated according to multiplicity, satisfy\n\u03bbn \u2212 kV k\u221e \u2264 \u03bcn \u2264 \u03bbn + kV k\u221e\nfor all n \u2265 1. Hence\n0 \u2264 e\u2212kV k\u221e t tr[e\u2212H0 t ] \u2264 tr[e\u2212Ht ] \u2264 ekV k\u221e t tr[e\u2212H0 t ]\nfor all t > 0.\nThe proof of the following theorem involves standard ingredients, [5, 6], but\nwe write it out in detail for the sake of completeness.\nTheorem 3 The operator e\u2212Ht has a non-negative continuous kernel K for\nall t > 0 and x, y \u2208 X. The kernel satisfies\n0 \u2264 e\u2212kV k\u221e t K0 (t, x, y) \u2264 K(t, x, y) \u2264 ekV k\u221e t K0 (t, x, y)\nfor all t > 0. The smallest eigenvalue \u03bc1 of H has multiplicity 1.\n5\n\n(3)\n\n\fProof We will assume throughout the proof that 0 < t < 1; once (3) has\nbeen proved in this case it can be extended to larger t by using the semigroup\nproperty. Since the quadratic form\nZ\nQ(f ) = Q0 (f ) +\nV (x)|f (x)|2 dx\nX\n\nis a Dirichlet form in the sense of [6, Theorem 1.3.2], the operators e\u2212Ht are all\npositivity preserving. The quadratic forms of H0 and H are comparable, so we\nmay use Proposition 1 to deduce that for every t \u2208 (0, 1) there is a bounded,\nmeasurable integral kernel K(t, x, y) satisfying 0 \u2264 K(t, x, y) \u2264 ct\u2212d/2 if 0 <\nt < 1 and\nZ\n\u2212Ht\n(e f )(x) =\nK(t, x, y)f (y) dy\nX\n\n2\n\nfor all f \u2208 L . Since\ne\u2212Ht = e\u2212H\u03b5 e\u2212H(t\u22122\u03b5) e\u2212H\u03b5\nfor all \u03b5 > 0 and t > 2\u03b5, we can use the norm analyticity of e\u2212H(t\u22122\u03b5) in L2 to\ndeduce the norm analyticity of e\u2212Ht from L1 to L\u221e . This implies that K(t, *, *)\ndepends analytically on t in the L\u221e (X \u00d7 X) norm for 0 < t < \u221e.\nThe upper and lower bounds in (3) are now direct applications of the Trotter\nproduct formula. (1) and (3) together imply that the operator A = e\u2212Ht is\nirreducible for all large enough t > 0. Therefore its largest eigenvalue has\nmultiplicity 1 by a direct application of [10, Theorem 13.3.6] to A/kAk.\nThe operator e\u2212Ht has an operator norm convergent infinite series expansion\ninvolving e\u2212H0 t and V , but we will use the more compact expression\ne\u2212Ht = e\u2212H0 t \u2212 A(t) + B(t)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere\nZ\n\nt\n\ne\u2212H0 (t\u2212s) V e\u2212H0 s ds,\nZs=0\nt Z s\nB(t) =\ne\u2212H0 (t\u2212s) V e\u2212H(s\u2212u) V e\u2212H0 u duds.\nA(t) =\n\ns=0\n\nu=0\n\nThe integrands are norm continuous in {s : 0 < s < t}, resp. {(s, u) : 0 < u <\ns < t}, and they are uniformly bounded in norm, so the integrals are norm\nconvergent and A(t), B(t) depend norm continuously on t.\nThe equation (4) has a version involving integral kernels, namely\nK(t, x, y) = K0 (t, x, y) \u2212 L(t, x, y) + M(t, x, y)\n6\n\n(5)\n\n\ffor all t > 0 and x, y \u2208 X, where\nZ t Z\nL(t, x, y) =\nK0 (t \u2212 s, x, z)V (z)K0 (s, z, y) dz,\ns=0\n\nz\u2208X\n\nand we will prove that\n|M(t, x, y)| \u2264 ct2\u2212d/2\n\n(6)\n\nfor all t \u2208 (0, 1) and x, y \u2208 X.\nWe will also prove that all the kernels on the right-hand side of (5) are continuous on (0, 1) \u00d7 X \u00d7 X, and this will establish that K is continuous on the same\nset. The estimates below involve the uniform norm k * k\u221e on B = C(X \u00d7 X).\nThe integral kernel of A(t) is\nL(t, x, y) =\n\nt\n\nZ\n\nLs,t (x, y) ds\n\n(7)\n\ns=0\n\nwhere Ls,t : X \u00d7 X \u2192 R is defined by\nZ\nLs,t (x, y) =\nK0 (t \u2212 s, x, z)V (z)K0 (s, z, y) dz.\nX\n\nNow Ls,t \u2208 B for all 0 < s < t and Ls,t depends norm continuously on s, t\nsubject to these conditions.

The bound on\n\u03c1(t) follows from (6).\n\u0003\n\n4\n\nThe main results\n\nIn this section we assume that H0 satisfies (H1) to (H4) and that H = H0 +\nV where V is a real bounded potential on X. Both operators have discrete\n\u221e\nspectrum, and their eigenvalues are denoted by {\u03bbn }\u221e\nn=1 , respectively {\u03bcn }n=1 ,\nwritten in increasing order and repeated according to multiplicity. We assumed\nthat \u03bb1 = 0 and proved that \u03bc1 has multiplicity 1; see Theorem 3. Our following\ntheorem has something in common with [15, Theorems 2.5, 3.4], which obtain\na related result for Schr\u00f6dinger operators in one and two dimensions subject\nto (10).\n8\n\n\fTheorem 5 If \u03bc1 \u2265 0 and\nZ\n\nV (x) dx \u2264 0\n\n(10)\n\nX\n\nthen V = 0.\nProof The variational estimate\n\u03bc1 \u2264 Q(\u03c61 ) = |X|\n\n\u22121\n\nZ\n\nV (x) dx \u2264 0,\nX\n\nwhere \u03c61 (x) = |X|\u22121/2 , shows that \u03bc1 = 0 under the stated conditions. We\napply the results of the last section to Hs = H0 +sV where s is a real parameter.\nThe smallest eigenvalue F (s) = \u03bc1 (s) of Hs has multiplicity 1 for all s \u2208 R and\ntherefore is an analytic function of s by a standard argument in perturbation\ntheory. It is also concave by a variational argument. Finally F (0) = 0 and\nZ\n\u2032\n\u22121\nV (x) dx \u2264 0.\nF (0) = hV \u03c61 , \u03c61 i = |X|\nX\n\nSince F (1) = 0, its concavity implies that F (s) must equal 0 for all s \u2208 [0, 1].\nBy its analyticity, F (s) = 0 for all s \u2208 R.\nIf V does not vanish identically then (10) implies that its negative part cannot\nvanish identically. Therefore there exists a function \u03c8 \u2208 L2 (X, dx) such that\nhV \u03c8, \u03c8i < 0. An approximation argument allows us to assume that \u03c8 \u2208\nQuad(H0 ). We now conclude that\nF (s) = Q0 (\u03c8) + shV \u03c8, \u03c8i < 0\nfor all large enough s > 0. The contradiction implies that V = 0.\nThe following is our main inverse spectral theorem.\nTheorem 6 If \u03bc1 \u2265 0 and lim supt\u21920 \u03c3(t) \u2264 0 where\nd/2\u22121\n\n\u03c3(t) = t\n\n\u221e\nX\nn=1\n\ne\u2212\u03bbn t \u2212 e\u2212\u03bcn t\n\n\u0001\n\nthen V = 0.\nProof We rewrite (9) in the form\nZ\nd/2\nK0 (t, x, x)V (x) dx\nt\nX\n\b\n= td/2\u22121 tr[e\u2212H0 t ] \u2212 tr[e\u2212Ht ] + td/2\u22121 \u03c1(t)\n= \u03c3(t) + td/2\u22121 \u03c1(t)\n\n9\n\n\u0003\n\n\fand\nR then take the limit of both sides as t \u2192 0. The left hand side\nR converges to\na X V (x) dx where a > 0, by (H2) and (H3). We deduce that X V (x) dx \u2264 0\nand may therefore apply Theorem 5.\n\u0003\nThe following corollary of Theorem 6 contains the original Ambarzumyan theorem as a special case.\nTheorem 7 If \u03bc1 \u2265 0 and lim supn\u2192\u221e (\u03bcn \u2212 \u03bbn ) \u2264 0 then V = 0.\nProof Given \u03b5 > 0 there exists N = N(\u03b5) such that \u03bcn \u2212 \u03bbn \u2264 \u03b5 for all n \u2265 N.\nWe then have\n\u03c3(t) = \u03c31 (t) + \u03c32 (t)\nwhere\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\nd/2\u22121\n\n\u03c31 (t) = t\n\n\u2264 td/2\n\ne\u2212\u03bbn t \u2212 e\u2212\u03bcn t\n\nn=1\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n\u0001\n\n|\u03bbn \u2212 \u03bcn |,\n\nn=1\n\nand\n\u03c32 (t)\n\n=\n\u2264\n\nd/2\u22121\n\nt\n\ntd/2\u22121\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=N\n\u221e\nX\n\ne\u2212\u03bbn t \u2212 e\u2212\u03bcn t\n\n\u0001\n\ne\u2212\u03bbn t (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b5t )\n\nn=N\n\n\u2264\n\n\u03b5td/2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u0001\n\ne\u2212\u03bbn t\n\nn=1\n\n\u2264 c\u03b5\nfor all t \u2208 (0, 1), by an application of (H2). We conclude that lim supt\u21920 \u03c3(t) \u2264\nc\u03b5 for all \u03b5 > 0, and may therefore apply Theorem 6.\n\u0003\nExample 8 Let H0 be a (non-negative) discrete Laplacian on l2 (X) for some\nfinite, combinatorial graph X, with |X| = n.

This is a result of a general principle that bounded\nchanges of the metric, and therefore of the local coordinate system, do not\naffect bounds such as (H2), [9]. The precise heat kernel asymptotics required\nin (H3) holds for all x \u2208\n/ \u2202X, and is a small part of classical results of Minakshisundaram, Pleijel and others concerning the small time asymptotics of\nthe heat kernel; see [3, 5, 11, 13]. In this context the nature of the boundary is\nirrelevant by the principle of 'not feeling the boundary'; see Theorem 12 and\n[8].\n\u0003\n\n5\n\nFinite quantum graphs\n\nIn this section we prove that Theorems 6 and 7 are applicable when X is a finite\nconnected quantum graph. We assume that X is the union of a finite number\nof edges e \u2208 E, each of finite length. Each edge terminates at two vertices\nout of a finite set V, and we assume that the graph as a whole is connected.\n2\nThe operator H0 acts in L2 (X, dx) by the formula H0 f (x) = \u2212 ddxf2 , subject\nto Kirchhoff boundary conditions at each vertex; more precisely we require\nthat all functions in the domain of H0 are continuous and that the sum of the\noutgoing derivatives vanishes at each vertex. All of our calculations depend on\nthe fact that the quadratic form associated with H0 is given by\nZ\nQ0 (f ) =\n|f \u2032 (x)|2 dx\nX\n\n1/2\n\nwith domain Quad(H0 ) = Dom(H0 ) = W 1,2 (X) where this is the space of all\nfunctions f whose restriction to any edge e lies in W 1,2 (e), together with the\nrequirement that f is continuous at every vertex. We observe that W 1,2 (X)\nis continuously embedded in C(X). It is immediate from its definition that\nQ0 is a Dirichlet form, so the operators e\u2212H0 t are positivity preserving for all\nt \u2265 0. The identity H0 1 = 0 implies that e\u2212H0 t 1 = 1 for all t \u2265 0, so e\u2212H0 t is a\nsymmetric Markov semigroup.\n11\n\n\fLemma 10 The operator H0 on L2 (X, dx) satisfies (H1), (H2) and (H4).\nProof If we disconnect X by imposing Neumann boundary conditions independently at the end of each edge, then we obtain a new operator H1 associated\na quadratic form Q1 ; this has the same formula as Q0 , but a larger domain,\nconsisting of all functions f \u2208 L2 (X, dx) such that the restriction of f to any\nedge e lies in W 1,2 (e). The operator H1 acts independently in each L2 (e, dx)\nand its heat kernel in e is of the form\n\u221e\n\n1 2 X \u2212\u03c02 n2 t/a2\ne\ncos(\u03c0nx/a) cos(\u03c0ny/a),\nKe (t, x, y) = +\na a n=1\nwhere we parametrize e by (0, a). One readily sees that each Ke is continuous\nand that\n|Ke (t, x, y)| \u2264 c1 t\u22121/2\nfor some c1 > 0, all x, y \u2208 e and all 0 < t < 1. Moreover Ke (t, x, y) \u2265 0\nbecause Q1 is a Dirichlet form. It follows from these observations that the\nvarious equivalent conditions of Proposition 1 hold for Q1 with d = 1. Since\nQ0 is a restriction of Q1 , Proposition 1 implies that\n0 \u2264 K0 (t, x, y) \u2264 c2 t\u22121/2\nfor some c2 > 0, all x, y \u2208 X and all 0 < t < 1. This completes the proof of\n(H2).\nTo prove (H1) we note that if {\u03c6n }\u221e\nn=1 is an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions\nof H0 and \u03bbn are the corresponding eigenvalues, then\n1/2\n\n\u03c6n \u2208 Dom(H0 ) \u2286 Dom(H0 ) = W 1,2 (X) \u2282 C(X).\nSince the series\nK0 (t, x, y) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\ne\u2212\u03bbn t \u03c6n (x)\u03c6n (y)\n\nn=1\n\nconverges uniformly on [\u03b1, \u221e) \u00d7 X \u00d7 X for every \u03b1 > 0 by [6, Theorem 2.1.4],\nwe deduce that K0 is continuous on (0, 1) \u00d7 X \u00d7 X.\nThe proof of (H4) depends on the observation that H0 \u03c6 = 0 if and only if\n\u03c6 \u2208 W 1,2 (X) \u2282 C(X) and\nZ\n0 = Q0 (\u03c6) =\n|\u03c6\u2032(x)|2 dx.\nX\n\nThis implies that \u03c6 is constant. Therefore 0 is an eigenvalue of multiplicity 1.\n\u0003\nOur final task is to prove (H3).\n12\n\n\f2\n\nd\nLemma 11 Let Ka (t, x, y) be the heat kernel of the operator \u2212 dx\n2 acting in\n2\nL (\u2212a, a) subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions at \u00b1a.

Sharper versions of the inequalities\n(12) and (13) may be proved by applying the Poisson summation formula to the\nexplicit eigenfunction expansion of Ka , [16]. An alternative proof of (12) based\non the properties of the underlying Brownian motion in given in [7, Lemma\n6.5].\nOne may prove (13) from (12) as follows. We define f, g : R \u2192 (0, \u221e) by\n\u001a\nKa (t, 0, x) if |x| \u2264 a,\nf (x) =\n0\notherwise,\ng(x) = K\u221e (t, 0, x) = (4\u03c0t)\u22121/2 e\u2212x\n\n2 /(4t)\n\n.\n\nso that 0 \u2264 f (x) \u2264 g(x) \u2264 (4\u03c0t)\u22121/2 for all x \u2208 R and\nTherefore\n\nR\n\nR\n\ng(x) dx = 1.\n\n0 \u2264 (8\u03c0t)\u22121/2 \u2212 Ka (2t, 0, 0)\n= K\u221e (2t, 0, 0) \u2212 Ka (2t, 0, 0)\nZ\n=\n{g(x)2 \u2212 f (x)2 } dx\nZR\n\u2264\n{g(x) \u2212 f (x)}2g(x) dx\nR\nZ\n\u22121/2\n{g(x) \u2212 f (x)} dx\n\u2264 (\u03c0t)\nR\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ a\n\u22121/2\n1\u2212\n= (\u03c0t)\nf (x) dx\n\u2264 (\u03c0t)\n\n\u22121/2\n\n\u2212a\n\u2212a2 /(8t)\n\n4e\n\n.\n\nby (H2). We finally obtain (13) upon replacing t by t/2.\nWe prove (H3) by using the principle of 'not feeling the boundary', [8].\n13\n\n\u0003\n\n\fTheorem 12 The operator H0 on L2 (X, dx) satisfies (H3), the exceptional set\nN being the set of all vertices on X.\nProof This repeats the argument used to prove (13). We assume that z \u2208 X\nis not a vertex and that a > 0 is its distance from the closest vertex. We then\nlet Ka denote the Dirichlet heat kernel for the interval I with centre z and\nlength 2a. Our task is to compare the heat kernel K of X with Ka . We use\nthe following facts.\n0 \u2264 Ka (t, x, y) \u2264 K0 (t, x, y)\nfor all t > 0 and x, y \u2208 X, where we put Ka (t, x, y) = 0 if x or y does not lie\nin the interval I. In addition 0 \u2264 K0 (t, x, y) \u2264 ct\u22121/2 for all 0 < t < 1 and all\nx, y \u2208 X. Finally\nZ\nK0 (t, x, y) dy = 1\n\nX\n\nfor all t > 0 and x \u2208 X.\nLet f (x) = Ka (t, z, x) and g(x) = K0 (t, z, x) so that 0 \u2264 f (x) \u2264 g(x) for all\nx \u2208 X.
