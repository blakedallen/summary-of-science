Introduction\nIt is expected that the influence of a magnetic field on vacuum particle\nproduction at the presence of a non-stationary electric field can be essential in many physical situations. It should be mentioned, first of all,\n\u2217 based on a poster presented at the conference \"progress in nonequilibrium greens functions, dresden, germany, 19.-22. august 2002\"\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nthat the joint consideration of chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields is\nnecessary while constructing the Flux Tube Model(FTM) of superconductive type when describing the pre-equilibrium evolution of Quark - Gluon\nPlasma(QGP), generated under extreme conditions of ultra-relativistic\nheavy ion collisions 1,10 . It is expected that extra-strong electromagnetic\nfields can exist in a series of astrophysical (e.g., magnetars) and cosmological (e.g., cosmic strings) objects. Finally, when achieving impact nearcritical magnetic fields in a laboratory environment in comparatively short\ndistances it would be very perspective to study combined action of electric\nand magnetic fields on vacuum e+ e\u2212 pair creation, e.g., under conditions\nof the planned experiment on the X-Free Electron Laser(X-FEL) 2 .\nElectron-positron pair production in constant electromagnetic(EM)\nfields was considered in the work 3 (see also 4 ). Here we will assume the\nelectric field is time dependent (but the magnetic field remains constant).\nFor derivation of the kinetic equation (KE) we will use non-perturbative\napproach developed in works5.\n2. Solution of the one-particle problem\nWe consider e+ e\u2212 vacuum pair creation under action of the external EM\nfield with the configuration of vector potential of the kind\n\u0001\nA\u03bc (~x, t) = 0, 0, \u2212Hx1, A3 (t) = A(t) ,\n(1)\n\nwhere H is the strength of the magnetic field, so that we have space homogeneous EM field, polarized in one direction. The electric field is time\ndependent, whereas the magnetic field is constant,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n~\n~ = (0, 0, H) ,\nE(t)\n= 0, 0, E 3 (t) = \u2212\u02263 (t) ,\nH\n(2)\n\nwhere dot denotes time derivative.\n\u0001\n\u03bc \u03bd\n\u03a8 = 0, where\nThe squared Dirac Equation is D2 + m2 + ie\n2 F\u03bc\u03bd \u03b3 \u03b3\nF\u03bc\u03bd = A\u03bd,\u03bc \u2212 A\u03bc,\u03bd , D\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u2212 ieA\u03bc and \u2212e is the electron charge. This\nequation in the chosen configuration of fields (1) has the form\n(\u220202 \u2212 \u25b3 + m2 + 2ie[Hx1 \u22022 \u2212 A\u22023 ] + e2 [H 2 (x1 )2 + A2 ] +\n\n+ie[\u22020 A\u03b3 0 \u03b3 3 \u2212 H\u03b3 1 \u03b3 2 ])\u03a8 = 0 .\n\n(3)\n\nLet us choose solution in the form\n2\n\n\u03a8r (~x, t) = CT (t)\u03a8(x1 )ei(p\n\nx2 +p3 x3 )\n\nRr ,\n\nwhere C is a normalizing constant and Rr (r = 1, 2) are Nikishov spinors\nR1+ = (0, 1, 0, \u22121),\n\nR2+ = (1, 0, 1, 0) .\n\n(4)\n3,4\n\n:\n\n(5)\n\n\f3\n\nThe result of separation of variables gives the time-dependent part\n\b\n\n2\n\u220202 + \u03c9r\u03bb\n(~\np, t) + ie\u22020 A T\u03bbr (t) = 0 ,\n\n(6)\n\nand space-dependent part\n\b\n\n\u220212 + 2ex1 p2 H \u2212 e2 (x1 )2 H 2 + \u03bb \u03a8(x1 ) = 0 ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03bb is a separation constant and\n2\n\u03c9r\u03bb\n(~\np, t) = (p2 )2 + (p3 + eA)2 + m2 \u2212 e(\u22121)r H + \u03bb .\n\nEq. (7) can be reduced to\n\u03a8\u2032\u2032n (\u03b7) + (2n + 1 \u2212 \u03b7 2 )\u03a8n (\u03b7) = 0, with \u03b7 =\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\np2\neH x1 \u2212\n,\neH\n\n(8)\n\nwhere prime means derivative with respect to \u03b7.\nThe solution of Eq. (8) is known\n\u03a8n (\u03b7) = exp(\u2212\u03b7 2 /2)Hn (\u03b7), with \u03bbn = (2n + 1)eH ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere Hn are Chebyshev-Hermite polynomials and we have solutions\n2\n\n(\u00b1)\n\n(\u00b1)\n(t)exp(\u2212\u03b7 2 /2)Hn (\u03b7)ei(p\n\u03a8np2 p3 ,r (~x, t) = Cn Tnr\n\nx2 +p3 x3 )\n\nRr ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere (\u00b1) signs correspond to positive and negative frequency solutions\nof the equation (6) and we have introduced the kinetic momentum P =\n2\np3 + eA(t) and one particle energy \u03c9rn\n(P ) = P 2 + m2 + eH[2n + 1 + (\u22121)r].\nFinally, the normalization conditions are\nZ\n(\u00b1)\n(\u00b1)\nd3 x\u03a8\u0304np2 P r (~x, t)\u03a8n\u2032 p\u20322 P \u2032 r\u2032 (~x, t) = \u03b4nn\u2032 \u03b4rr\u2032 \u03b4(p2 \u2212 p\u20322 )\u03b4(P \u2212 P \u2032 ) , (11)\n\u00011/4 1 n+1 \u22121/2\nn!)\n.\nwith normalization constant Cn = eH\n\u03c0\n2\u03c0 (2\nFunctions (10) form the complete system of orthonormalized functions.\nThat is enough for the construction of the secondary quantized representation with the field operator\no\nn\nXZ\n(+)\n(+)\n(\u2212)\n(\u2212)\n(12)\n\u03a8(x) =\ndP \u03a8np2 P r (~x, t)anp2 P r + \u03a8np2 P r (~x, t)anp2 P r ,\nr,n\n\nwhere a(\u2212) , a\u2217(+) are annihilation and creation operators with the standard\nset of anti-commutation relations.\n\n\f4\n\n3. The kinetic equation in the quasi-particle representation\nThe Kinetic Equation(KE) derivation requires the transition to the quasiparticle representation, which is archived by the diagonalization procedure\nof the Hamiltonian. In the considered case the procedure is distinguished\nfrom the usual one 4 only in some details, concerned with the specific character of basis functions (10). Let the new operators b(\u2212) (t) and b\u2217(+) (t)\nare annihilation and creation operators in the quasi-particle representation,\nconnected with a(\u2212) and a\u2217(+) operators by the time dependent Bogoliubov\ntransformation 4 . Then it is possible to introduce the distribution function\nof electrons in the new representation with the momentum p2 , P and spin\nr on the Landau n- level\n(\u2212)\n\n\u2217(+)\n\nfnr (p2 , P, t) = h0in |bnp2 P r (t)bnp2 P r (t)|0in i\n\n(13)\n\nand the corresponding distribution function of positrons f \u0304nr (p2 , P, t) with\nan electric neutrality condition f = f \u0304.\nThe KE derivation for function (13) differs from the case of H = 0 5 only\nin some details concerned with the source term describing the processes of\nvacuum tunneling. Now we have\nf \u0307nr (P, t) = Snr (P, t) ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere source of pair production is\nSnr (p2 , P, t) = Snr (P, t) = 12 wnr (P, t)\u00d7\nn R\no (15)\nt\n\u00d7 \u2212\u221e dt wnr (P (t, t ), t )[1 \u2212 2fnr (P, t )] cos 2 t\u2032 d\u03c4 \u03c9nr (P, \u03c4 ) ,\nRt\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere P (t, t\u2032 ) = P \u2212 e\n\n\u2032\n\nRt\n\nt\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nd\u03c4 E(t) and\n\nwnr (P, t) =\n\neE(t)\u03b5nr\n,\n2 (P )\n\u03c9nr\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03b52nr = m2 + eH[1 + 2n + (\u22121)r ].\nAs one can see from Eqs. (15)-(16) the distribution function does not\ndepend on p2 , fnr (p2 , P, t) = fnr (P, t) (the cylindrical symmetry of the\nconsidered problem). This circumstance was taken into account in the KE\nEq. (14).\nThe comparison of the source term (15)-(16) with the \"old\" case H = 0 5\nshows that the \"new\" quasi-particle frequency \u03c9rn , transition amplitude\n(16) and transversal energy \u03b5nr can be obtained from the corresponding\n\"old\" formulas by means of formal substitution\n(p1 )2 + (p2 )2 = p2\u22a5 \u2192 eH[1 + 2n + (\u22121)r ] ,\n\n(17)\n\n\f5\n\nwhich provides discrete transversal energy as in the case with boundary\nconditions 8\nFor numerical analysis it is convenient to reduce the KE (14)-(16) to\nthe following system of ordinary differential equations:\n1\nf \u0307nr (P, t) = wnr (P, t)vnr (P, t) ,\n2\nv\u0307nr (P, t) = wnr (P, t)(1 \u2212 2fnr (P, t)) \u2212 2\u03c9nr (P, t)znr (P, t) ,\n(18)\n\u017cnr (P, t) = 2\u03c9nr (P, t)vnr (P, t) ,\n\nwhere v and z are auxiliary functions.\n4.

Back reaction problem\nFor the description of the back reaction problem it is necessary to add the\nregularized Maxwell equation. It follows from Eq. (16) that w \u223c P \u22122 at\nP \u2192 \u221e. It leads to the absence of ultraviolet divergences in the densities of\nobserved quantities, which are expressed by means of integrals containing\nthe function fnr (P, t). However, there is divergence of the sum over levels n and corresponding counter terms should subtracted while calculating\ndensities of physical values.\nIn order to construct counter-terms according to the procedure of nwave regularization 4,6 , it is necessary to expand functions f ,v and z in\nasymptotic series under inverse powers of one particle energy \u03c9\u03b1 . After\napplication of this procedure to the set of Eqs. (18) we obtain leading\ncontributions\n\u0012 \u0013g\u03b1 \u22121\n\u0012 \u0013g\u03b1 \u22121 !2\n\u01eb\u03b1\n\u01eb\u03b1\neE(t)P\ne\u0116(t)P\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n,\nf4 (t) =\n,\nv3 (t) =\n4\u03c9\u03b1 (P, t) P\n4\u03c9\u03b1 (P, t) P\nwhere g\u03b1 is the degeneracy factor for corresponding set \u03b1 of quantum numbers {n, r} or {n}.\nThe counter term is similar to the case H = 0 9 and sum diverges\nlogarithmically at n \u2192 \u221e for fermions and at |P | \u2192 \u221e for scalar particles.\nThus, we find that the mean number density of e+ e\u2212 pairs\nX\nn(t) =\n(P )fnr (P, t)\nnr\n\nis finite, whereas the mean energy density and the total current density as\nthe sum of the conduction and the vacuum polarization currents contain\ndivergences, which can be eliminated with the help of counter terms:\nX\n\u03b5(t) = 2\n(P ) {\u03c9nr (P )(fnr (P, t) \u2212 fc (P, t))} ,\n(24)\nnr\n\nX\nj \u2212 (t) = 2e\n(P )\nnr\n\n1\n\u03c9nr (P )\n\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1\nP fnr (P, t) + \u03b5nr (vnr (P, t) \u2212 vc (P, t)) , (25)\n2\n\nExpressions (24) and (25) are renormalized according to charge renormalization procedure 6,9 . Here we have the short notation\ng\u03b1 \u221e Z\nX\neH X X \u221e\ndP .\n(26)\n(P ) =\n(2\u03c0)2 r=1 n=0 \u2212\u221e\nnr\n\nThe factor eH describes the degeneracy of the distribution function (13)\nrelatively of p\u22a5 7 .\nThe Eqs. system (18) with the Maxwell Eq. \u0116 = \u2212j \u03b1 (t) compose the\ncomplete equation system of back reaction problem.\n\n\f7\n\n6. Conclusion and numerical results\nThe creation of scalar particle in the time dependent electric field with\nthe presence of the strong collinear magnetic field is accompanied by the\n\u00011/2\nincrease of effective mass m \u2192 m\u2217n = m2 + |e|H(2n + 1)\n, so that we\nhave even in the basic state m\u2217n=0 > m. This circumstance decreases the\nvacuum production of scalar bosons in the magnetic field 4 .

Number density of fermions for E\nfunction of magnetic field strength.\n\nuation is in the fermionic case: as it follows from (16), the effective mass\ncoincides with the particle mass for the spin states of electrons oriented opposite to the magnetic field. That leads to paramagnetism of e+ e\u2212 plasma,\ncreated from vacuum by the EM field (1). When spin oriented along the\nmagnetic field direction then the effective mass m\u22172 = (m2 + 2|e|Hn)1/2 and\nvacuum creation of such electrons and positrons are suppressed. However,\nthe creation of the electrons in the state with r = 1 with effective mass\nm\u22171 = m turns out more intensive in comparison with the case of an absence of magnetic field (this fact is well known for constant EM fields 4 ).\nIn Fig. 1 we show the number density of e+ e\u2212 pairs after action of external\nelectric field impulse as a function of magnetic field strength.
