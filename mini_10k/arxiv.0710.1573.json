We present a study of threshold resummation effects for slepton pair production\nat the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). After confirming the known NLO QCD corrections and\ngeneralizing the NLO SUSY-QCD corrections to the case of mixing squarks in the virtual loop\ncontributions, we employ the Mellin N -space resummation formalism to compute logarithmically\nenhanced soft-gluon terms to all perturbative orders.\n\n1. Introduction\nScalar leptons are among the lightest supersymmetric particles in many SUSY-breaking scenarios\n[1]. They mainly decay into their Standard Model (SM) leptonic partners and the lightest\nsupersymmetric particle. Searches for sleptons at hadron colliders will thus mainly be focused\non highly-energetic lepton pairs plus missing energy. A precise prediction of the transversemomentum spectrum of the slepton pair [2] allows to use the Cambridge (s)transverse mass\nto measure the slepton masses [3] and spin [4] and to extract the signal from W W and tt\u0304\nproduction events [5, 6], which are the main backgrounds to Drell-Yan slepton pair production\nat the LHC. The (LO) cross section for the production of a non-mixing slepton pair was computed\nin [7, 8, 9, 10], while recently the mixing between the interaction eigenstates has been included\n[11]. The next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections have been calculated in [12], and the\nfull SUSY-QCD corrections have been added in [13]. The genuine SUSY corrections turned out\nto be quite small compared to the standard QCD ones due to the presence of massive non-mixing\nsquarks and gluino propagators in the loop diagrams.\nThe aim of our work [14] was to extend the previous calculations by including mixing effects\nrelevant for the squarks appearing in the loops, and also considering the threshold-enhanced\ncontributions due to soft-gluon emission from the initial state. These enhancements arise when\nthe available partonic energy is just enough to produce the final state particles and thus there\nis a mismatch between virtual corrections and phase-space suppressed real-gluon emission. This\ncauses the appearance of large logarithmic terms \u03b1sn [ln2n\u22121 (1 \u2212 z)/(1 \u2212 z)]+ at the nth order of\nperturbation theory, where z = M 2 /s, M is the slepton-pair invariant mass, and s is the partonic\ncenter-of-mass energy. Clearly, when s is close to M 2 , the convergence of the perturbative result\nis spoiled and the large logarithms have to be resummed, i.e. taken into account to all orders\nin \u03b1s . Most importantly, the convolution of the partonic cross section with the steeply falling\nparton distributions enhances the threshold contributions even far from hadronic threshold, i.e.\nwhen \u03c4 = M 2 /S \u001c 1, where S is the hadronic center-of-mass energy. Large corrections are\n\n\fthus expected for the Drell-Yan production of a slepton pair with invariant mass M of a few\nhundreds GeV at the LHC.\nThe resummation of the large logarithmic contributions proceeds through the exponentiation\nof the soft-gluon radiation, which does not take place in z-space directly, but in Mellin N space, where N is the Mellin-variable conjugate to z: the threshold region z \u2192 1 corresponds\nto the limit N \u2192 \u221e. A final inverse Mellin-transform is thus required to go back to the\nusual z-space. Threshold resummation for the Drell-Yan process was first performed in [15, 16]\nat the leading-logarithmic (LL) and next-to-leading-logarithmic (NLL) levels, corresponding\nto terms of the form \u03b1sn lnn+1 N and \u03b1sn lnn N in the exponent. The extension to the NNLL\nlevel (\u03b1sn lnn\u22121 N terms) has been carried out both for the Drell-Yan process [17] and for Higgsboson production [18]. Very recently, even the NNNLL contributions (\u03b1sn lnn\u22122 N terms) became\navailable [19, 20, 21].\nA suitable matching procedure has eventually to be performed in order to keep the full\ninformation contained in the fixed-order calculation and to apply the resummation technique\nonly where it is fully justified. A correct matching is achieved by adding the resummed and\nfixed-order contributions and then subtracting the expansion of the resummed result at the same\nperturbative order of the fixed-order calculation: in this way, a possible double-counting of the\nlogarithmically-enhanced contributions is avoided and a uniform theoretical accuracy over the\nentire invariant mass range is obtained.\n2. Numerical results\nSince the total cross section for slepton pair production is currently available at NLO, we could\nonly perform soft-gluon resummation at the NLL+NLO level [14].\nWe used the computer program SUSPECT [22] to calculate the physical masses of the SUSY\nparticles and the mixing angles, and we chose the mSUGRA point SPS 1a and GMSB point SPS\n7 [23], as benchmarks for our numerical studies. In the case of the lightest stau mass eigenstate\n\u03c4\u03031 , which we will examine in the following, the returned value for the mass is m\u03c4\u03031 =136.2 GeV\nfor SPS 1a and m\u03c4\u03031 =114.8 GeV for SPS 7. Feasibility studies of tau-slepton identification at the\nLHC with the ATLAS detector [24] and tau tagging with the CMS detector [25] have recently\nshown that stau masses should be observable up to the TeV \u221a\nrange. The cross sections have\nbeen calculated both \u221a\nfor the Tevatron, currently operating at S=1.96 TeV and for the LHC,\nbound to operate at S=14 TeV. For LO (NLO and NLL) predictions, we used the LO 2001\n[26] (NLO 2004 [27]) MRST-sets of parton distribution functions.\nIn Fig.1 we show the K-factor, with respect to the LO result, of the invariant-mass M\u03c4\u03031 \u03c4\u03031\u2217\ndistribution for stau pair production at the LHC: the total NLL+NLO matched, the NLL\nresummed, the fixed order NLO (SUSY-)QCD and the expanded NLL resummed curves are\nplotted.\nThe resummed contribution mildly grows with M , reaching a 7% increase over the fixed-order\nresult for M =3 TeV. In this large-M region, the resummed result approaches the total prediction,\nsince the NLO QCD calculation is dominated by large logarithms and thus approaches the\nexpanded resummed result. However, we are still far from the hadronic threshold region, so\nthat both resummed and fixed-order contributions and a consistent matching of the two are\nneeded. At lower values of M , where finite terms dominate, the resummed contribution is close\nto its fixed-order expansion and disappears with M .\nThe dependence on the factorization and renormalization scales has also been investigated\nboth for the total cross section and for the invariant mass differential distribution. Within the\nconventional scale variations m\u03c4\u03031 /2 < \u03bcF = \u03bcR < 2m\u03c4\u03031 , the uncertainty reduces from 20% at\nNLO to roughly 10% after the inclusion of threshold effects.\nAcknowledgements.
