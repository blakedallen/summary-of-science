Wave breaking in ideal gas flows [4],\npinching of droplets [5] and creation of black holes [6] are\nexamples of finite-time singularities which dramatically\nchange the dynamics in the system when they appear.\nSingularities often signal breakdown of theory. In this\ncase either the theory is regularized by introducing additional macroscopic mechanisms, or the continuum description is abandoned in favor of a discrete microscopic\ntheory. A long-standing problem of hydrodynamics is\nwhether a finite-time vorticity singularity develops in an\ninitially smooth three-dimensional incompressible flow.\nDespite considerable effort, both the inviscid Euler case\n[7], and the viscous, Navier-Stokes case [8] remain unresolved.\nThe present paper deals with a somewhat simpler problem of finite-time density singularities in dilute granular\ngases. In contrast to ordinary molecular gases, granular gases \"cool\" spontaneously because of the inelastic\ncollisions between the grains. Strikingly, even a slight inelasticity of the collisions may cause the granular gas to\nform dense clusters of particles, even when starting from\na dilute and macroscopically homogeneous initial state.\nThis fascinating example of structure formation has been\ninvestigated by means of molecular dynamics simulations\n[9\u201324] and hydrodynamic simulations [20, 21, 23\u201330]. In\naddition, as many as five different hydrodynamical scenarios have been suggested for the clustering instability;\nsee Ref. [24] for a concise critical review. The clustering instability in granular gases has an interesting analog\nin the form of condensation instability in optically thin\ngases and plasmas that cool by their own radiation [31].\nThe Navier-Stokes granular hydrodynamics is a nat-\n\nural starting point for a physicist who wants to understand and predict collective physical phenomena in granular gases [32, 33]. Granular hydrodynamics provides\npowerful insights into the physics of granular flow, not\nin a small part because its predictions are occasionally\nsuccessful beyond its (quite restrictive) formal limits of\nvalidity [33]. In the present work we will employ the\nNavier-Stokes granular hydrodynamics in an attempt to\nbetter understand the physics of clustering, including its\nultimate stage of thermal collapse, in a freely-cooling dilute granular gas in two dimensions (2D). We will assume throughout the paper that the particle collisions\nare nearly elastic, the local gas density (that we denote\nby \u03c1) is much smaller than the close-packing density, and\nthe Knudsen number of the granular gas is very small:\n1 \u2212 \u03b12 \u226a 1 ,\n\n\u03c1\u03c3 d \u226a 1 ,\n\nand\n\nlf ree /L \u226a 1 .\n\n(1)\n\nHere 0 \u2264 \u03b1 < 1 is the coefficient of normal restitution\nof binary collisions, \u03c3 is the particle diameter, d \u2265 1 is\nthe dimension of space, lf ree is the mean free path of\nthe gas, and L is the characteristic hydrodynamic length\nscale. Under these assumptions (the second and third\nof them need to be verified a posteriori, after the hydrodynamic problem in question is solved) the NavierStokes hydrodynamics provides a quantitatively accurate\nleading-order theory [32, 33].\nIn a sufficiently small container, a freely cooling granular gas becomes homogeneous because of heat diffusion.\nFrom then on, the gas temperature decays according to\nHaff's law T \u223c (t0 + t)\u22122 , where t is time, and t0 = const\n[34]. This Homogeneous Cooling State (HCS) is linearly\nunstable, however, when the container size exceeds a critical value [10, 13, 14, 35]. The instability manifests itself\nby the appearance of density inhomogeneities (the clustering instability) and vortical motions (the shear instability), each of them with its own critical system size.\n\n\f2\nPreceding our work is a series of papers [23, 24, 28\u2013\n30, 36] which dealt with nonlinear clustering dynamics of\na freely-cooling granular gas in a narrow channel. Fouxon\net al. [29, 30] investigated the nonlinear clustering analytically and numerically, using ideal (Euler) granular\nhydrodynamics for a dilute gas which neglects heat diffusion and viscosity. They found a family of exact analytic solutions for the clustering flow. These solutions\ndescribe the evolution of an initially smooth flow toward\nthermal collapse: a finite-time density blowup. Close to\nthe blowup time t\u2217 , the maximum gas density exhibits\na power law behavior \u223c (t\u2217 \u2212 t)\u22122 . The minimum temperature of the gas vanishes as (t\u2217 \u2212 t)2 . The velocity\ngradient blows up as \u223c (t\u2217 \u2212 t)\u22121 , whereas the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp, rather\nthan a shock discontinuity, at the singularity. Molecular\ndynamics simulations of a freely cooling granular gas in\na channel geometry [24] showed an excellent agreement\nwith one of the exact solutions until sufficiently close to\nthe attempted collapse, where heat diffusion becomes important. At finite gravity, a one-dimensional (1D) cooling\nflow also develops thermal collapse, and exhibits the same\nasymptotic scaling behavior near the singularity, even in\nthe framework of non-ideal, Navier-Stokes granular hydrodynamics [23].\nDespite the blowup of the density and the velocity gradient, the gas pressure behaves regularly in all examples of thermal collapse considered in Refs. [23, 29, 30].\nAt zero gravity the collapse occurs at almost constant\npressure [29, 30], whereas at finite gravity the pressure\nis approximately hydrostatic [23]. The authors of Refs.\n[23, 36] took advantage of these salient features to greatly\nsimplify the full 1D hydrodynamic problem, which takes\na full account of heat diffusion and viscosity. It turns out\nthat, at zero gravity, the heat diffusion arrests the thermal collapse in 1D [36]. Instead of blowing up, the gas\ndensity approaches a time-independent Inhomogeneous\nCooling Sate in which the heat diffusion balances the\nclustering instability brought about by the collisional energy loss.\nThese 1D hydrodynamic results, however, are strikingly different from those observed in molecular dynamics simulations of a freely cooling granular gas in 2D\n[10, 11, 14, 16], where the gas density continues to grow\nuntil close-packed clusters of of particles are formed. To\naddress this issue, the nonlinear hydrodynamic theory of\nclustering must be extended to higher dimensions. The\nfirst step in this direction has been recently taken by\nFouxon [37]. Assuming a zero pressure gradient and using Lagrangian coordinates he showed that, in the framework of ideal hydrodynamics, thermal collapse persists in\nany dimension. In Lagrangian coordinates the flow singularity turns out to be identical to the one found in 1D\n[36]. Fouxon [37] also briefly considered the non-ideal,\nNavier-Stokes flow. Here he found inhomogeneous solutions with time-independent density profiles, but left\nopen the question of their stability.\nIn this work we apply Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics to\n\na freely-cooling granular gas in 2D, in a circular geometry. The final outcome of our work is quite different both\nfrom the previous 1D results [36], and from the results of\nRef. [37]. The hydrodynamic problem is formulated in\nsection II. In Section III we perform a marginal stability\nanalysis of the HCS in a circular container and find the\ncritical radii of the container for the clustering modes and\nshear modes. One of the surprising results, presented in\nsection IV, shows that the clustering instability appears\nin this geometry via a sub-critical bifurcation. This suggests that the dilute flow can develop thermal collapse,\nand we support this conjecture by hydrodynamic simulation (that is, by solving the hydrodynamic equations numerically). To get a more analytical insight we switch, in\nsection V, to a narrow-sector-shaped container, see Fig.\n1. Here any flow structure in the azimuthal direction is\nsuppressed by heat diffusion. As a result, the sector geometry renders the simplicity of an effectively 1D (purely\nradial) time-dependent flow, while retaining some critical\n2D features. We find that, in the sector geometry, the\nbifurcation of the clustering instability is transcritical.\nHere stable time-independent azimuthally-symmetric inhomogeneous density states exist with a density peak at\nthe circumference of the sector. For these states the density growth is exactly balanced by heat diffusion. But on\nthe same bifurcation diagram there also regions which\ndo not correspond to any time-independent state. Our\nhydrodynamic simulations in these regions give a strong\nevidence for thermal collapse unarrested by heat diffusion, this time at the vertex of the sector. We investigate\nthermal collapse analytically in section VI. We determine\nscaling laws, in time and in space, for an ideal collapse\nwhich we assume to develop on the background of an almost constant pressure. Using the scaling laws we find\nthat the non-ideal transport mechanisms \u2013 heat diffusion\nand viscosity \u2013 are in general unable to arrest the collapse\nin any dimension higher than one.\n\nFIG. 1: Two-dimensional container geometries considered in\nthis work.\n\nII.\nA.\n\nHYDRODYNAMIC FORMULATION\n\nGoverning equations and boundary conditions\n\nThe granular hydrodynamic equations express local\nconservation of mass and momentum, and local energy\n\n\f3\nbalance, in the granular gas. Assuming the strong inequalities (1), one can use the following set of hydrodynamic equations [32, 33, 38]. The continuity equation,\n\u2202\u03c1\n+ \u2207 * (\u03c1v) = 0,\n\u2202t\nand the momentum equation,\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u221a\n\u2202v\n\u03c1\n+ (v * \u2207)v = \u2212\u2207p + \u03bd0 \u2207 * ( T \u03a3\u0302).\n\u2202t\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nare the usual Navier-Stokes equations for a compressible\nflow. Here \u03c1(r,\u221at) is the gas density, v(r, t) is the gas\nvelocity, and \u03bd0 T \u03a3\u0302 is the viscosity tensor. In Cartesian\ncoordinates\n\u03a3\u0302ki = \u2202k vi + \u2202i vk \u2212 \u03b4ik \u2207 * v,\n\n(4)\n\nAs the viscosity tensor is symmetric and traceless [4],\nthe other components can be readily found: \u03a3\u03b8\u03b8 =\n\u2212\u03a3rr , \u03a3r\u03b8 = \u03a3\u03b8r .\nThe hydrodynamic equations need to be supplemented\nby boundary conditions. Let R be the radius of the container. We choose the boundary conditions so as not\nto introduce any sources or sinks of mass, momentum\nand energy, and also not to break azimuthal symmetry.\nTherefore, we demand a zero granular heat flux through\nthe circumference r = R which, for T > 0, leads to\n\u2202T\n(r = R, \u03b8, t) = 0.\n\u2202r\n\nFurthermore, we demand that particle collisions with the\nwall r = R be elastic, and that the wall be impenetrable.\nThese lead to slip boundary condition for v\u03b8 and zero\nboundary condition for vr :\n\nsee Ref. [4]. The energy equation reads:\n\u221a\n\u2202T\n\u03ba0\n+ (v * \u2207)T = \u2212(\u03b3 \u2212 1)T \u2207 * v + \u2207 * ( T \u2207T )\n\u2202t\n\u03c1\n\u221a\n\u03bd0 (\u03b3 \u2212 1) T 2\n\u2212 \u039b\u03c1T 3/2 +\n\u03a3\u0302 ,\n(5)\n2\u03c1\nwhere \u03b3 is the adiabatic index of the gas (\u03b3 = 2 and\n5/3 for d = 2 and d = 3, respectively), and the idealgas equation of state p = \u03c1T is used.

The case of no-slip boundary condition, v\u03b8 (R, \u03b8, t) = 0, is briefly discussed in section III\nD.\nFor the narrow-sector-shaped container one should also\nprescribe boundary conditions on the straight segments\nof the sector. However, in the absence of azimuthal variations of the hydrodynamic fields, and for v\u03b8 \u2261 0, there\nis no need of prescribing these boundary conditions explicitly.\nB.\n\nGlobal conservation laws\n\nEquations (2)-(5), together with the \"conservative\"\nboundary conditions (8)-(9), give rise to two conservation laws and a balance relation:\nh\u03c1i = const.\nh\u03c1rv\u03b8 i = const.\n\u001d\n\u001c\nD\nE\nd 1 2\n\u03c1v + \u03c1T = \u2212\u039b \u03c12 T 3/2 ,\ndt 2\n\n(10)\n(11)\n(12)\n\nwhere h. . .i denotes averaging over the area of the circular\ncontainer:\nZ\n1\nh. . . i =\n. . . d2 r .\n(13)\n\u03c0R2 D\nEquation (10) describes conservation of the total mass\nof the gas. Equation (11) describes conservation of the\nangular momentum of the gas around the center of the\ncontainer. This conservation law is special for the circular\ngeometry; it is expected, as neither of the forces in the\nright hand side of Eq. (3) creates torque. Indeed, a\n\n\f4\npressure gradient cannot create torque, whereas a viscous\nstress causes the momentum only to diffuse but not to\ndissipate. In addition, the wall r = R exerts, according to\nthe boundary conditions (9), an effective force on the gas\nonly in the radial direction which again does not produce\na torque.\nEquation (12) describes the global energy loss of the\ngas. As the wall is adiabatic, energy can only escape\nto the internal degrees of freedom of the grains. Equation (12) states that, as long as the gas is not \"frozen\"\n(T 6= 0), the energy will continue to dissipate. Relations (10)-(12) are also valid in the sector geometry.\nThere Eq. (11) is satisfied trivially, as v\u03b8 = 0.\n\nIII. MARGINAL STABILITY OF THE\nHOMOGENEOUS COOLING STATE\n\nApart from inertia of the flow, there are two competing mechanisms which ultimately determine the spatial\nstructure of a freely cooling granular gas. These are\nthe inelastic energy loss which drives the clustering- and\nshear-mode instabilities [10, 35], and the heat diffusion\nand viscosity which tend to erase inhomogeneities in the\ngas. The rest of parameters being fixed, the heat diffusion and viscosity prevail in sufficiently small containers;\nhere the granular gas approaches the HCS. When the\ncontainer size is increased, larger-scale perturbations become possible, and the HCS eventually loses its stability.\nIn this section we will find the critical radii of the circular container for the clustering modes and the shear\nmode which can bifurcate from the HCS. When the HCS\nis no longer stable, it is the further development of these\nmodes which determine the late-time behavior of the gas.\nLinear stability analysis of the HCS was performed by\nMcNamara [35], Deltour and Barrat [13], Brey et al. [38]\nand other workers. Here we extend the previous analysis, that was done in rectangular geometries, to the circular geometry. As we are only interested in the bifurcation points (where the system's behavior qualitatively\nchanges) and do not need to know the growth rates of linear perturbations, we will limit ourselves to a marginal\nstability analysis.\n\nA.\n\nwhere t0 = const. For sufficiently small circular containers, see below, and if the total angular momentum\nof the gas is zero, the HCS is a global attractor of the\nflow in this geometry. On a qualitative level, the HCS\nstability in small containers is evident from the hydrodynamic equations. If the system size is R, the heatdiffusion term in Eq. (5) scales as R\u22122 while the cooling\nterm is R-independent. Therefore, as R becomes small,\nthe heat diffusion generates a flow which erases any inhomogeneities.\nB.\n\nSmall-amplitude modes are decoupled\n\nAlthough the HCS is not a steady state of the system in the usual sense, it does become a steady state\nin rescaled variables.\nThe rescaled temperature is\n\u03c4 (r, t) = T (r, t)/TH (t); the density remains unchanged.\nMarginal stability for the gas velocity implies a constant Mach number: the velocity decays neither faster\nnor\np slower than the (time-dependent) speed of sound\n\u03b3TH (t). Therefore, we introduce the rescaled velocity\nu by putting\np\nv(r, t) = \u03b3TH (t)u(r, t).\n(16)\n\nWe emphasize that we will only deal with zero-angularmomentum flows. Indeed, as the HCS has a zero angular\nmomentum, no finite-angular-momentum state can bifurcate from it.\nLet us linearize the hydrodynamic equations (2)-(5)\naround the HCS. We introduce small perturbations to\neach of the variables,\n\u03c1 = \u03c10 (1 + \u03b4\u03c1)\nT = TH (t)(1 + \u03b4\u03c4 )\np\n\u03b3TH (t)\u03b4u,\nv =\n\nwhere \u03c10 is the average density of the gas. For marginally\nstable states\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03b4\u03c1 = \u03b4\u03c4 = \u03b4u = 0.\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\n(18)\n\nAs a result, the continuity equation (2) becomes\n\u2207 * \u03b4u = 0.\n\nThe HCS is stable in small systems\n\n(17)\n\n(19)\n\nNext, we linearize the energy equation (5):\nThe HCS is the simplest exact solution of Eqs. (2)-(9).\nHere \u03c1 = \u03c10 = const, and v = 0. The energy equation\nbecomes\ndT (t)/dt = \u2212\u039b\u03c10 T 3/2 (t) ,\n\n(14)\n\nand so the gas temperature decays according to Haff's\nlaw [34]:\nTH (t) =\n\n4\n,\n[\u039b\u03c10 (t + t0 )]2\n\n(15)\n\n2\u03b4\u03c1 + \u03b4\u03c4 \u2212 l\u03ba2 \u22072 \u03b4\u03c4 = 0,\n\n(20)\np\nwhere l\u03ba = 2\u03ba0 /(\u039b\u03c120 ) is the critical length for clustering instability in a rectangular geometry [10, 35, 36, 38].\nFinally, we linearize the momentum equation (3):\n2\n\u2207(\u03b4\u03c1 + \u03b4\u03c4 ),\n(21)\n\u03b4u + l\u03bd2 \u22072 \u03b4u = \u221a\n\u03b3\u039b\u03c10\np\nwhere l\u03bd = 2\u03bd0 /(\u039b\u03c120 ) is the critical length for the shear\ninstability in a rectangular geometry [10, 35, 38, 39]. By\n\n\f5\nvirtue of Eq. (19), the linearized flow is incompressible.\nAs a result, the velocity field is purely solenoidal. Now\nwe see that the left hand side of Eq. (21) is solenoidal,\nwhile the right hand side is potential. By the Helmholtz\ndecomposition theorem for vector fields, see e.g. [40],\neach side of the equation must be equal to zero. In other\nwords, the shear modes and the density modes (the clustering modes) decouple. As a result,\n\u03b4\u03c1 + \u03b4\u03c4 = const.\n\n(22)\n\nR\nd2 r = 0 by virtue of mass conservation, and\nNow,\nR D \u03b4\u03c1\n2\nso D \u03b4\u03c4 d r = 0 by virtue of Eq. (20), where D represents the circular container. Therefore, \u03b4\u03c1 = \u2212\u03b4\u03c4 : at\nmarginality the small density and temperature perturbations are isobaric. For the velocity we can introduce\nthe Stokes' stream function, as the flow is incompressible. Putting \u03b4ux = \u2202\u03c8/\u2202y and \u03b4uy = \u2212\u2202\u03c8/\u2202x, we reduce the marginal stability equations to two independent\nHelmholtz equations\n\u03b4\u03c1 + l\u03ba2 \u22072 \u03b4\u03c1 = 0 ,\n\u03c8 + l\u03bd2 \u22072 \u03c8 = 0 ,\n\nFIG. 2: The density field \u03c1(r, \u03b8) = 1 \u2212 0.1 J0 (r/l\u03ba ) for the\nlowest marginally stable clustering mode m = 0 with R =\nR0 = 3.83171 . . . l\u03ba .\n\n(23)\n(24)\n\nfor the clustering modes and shear modes, respectively.\n\nC.\n\nClustering modes\n\nThe regular independent solutions of Eq.

The\nfirst two marginally stable modes are the lowest m = 0\nmode with R = R0 = 3.83171 . . . l\u03ba and the lowest m = 1\nmode with R = R1 = 1.84118 . . . l\u03ba (see e.g. Ref. [43]\nfor the roots of the Bessel functions and their derivatives). The m = 0 modes are azimuthally symmetric.\nThe gas density, corresponding to the lowest of them, is\n\u03c1 = 1 + C0 J0 (r/l\u03ba ), where the sign of the constant C0\ndetermines whether the gas is denser at the center or at\nthe circumference. An example of this density profile is\ndepicted in Fig. 2. For the m = 1 modes the azimuthal\nsymmetry is broken; the density profile of the lowest of\nthem is \u03c1 = 1 + C1 J1 (r/l\u03ba ) cos(\u03b8), see Fig. 3.\nAs the container radius increases from zero, the first\nbifurcation occurs at R = R1 for the lowest m = 1 mode.\nTherefore, the lowest m = 1 mode, rather than the lowest\nm = 0 mode, is the most unstable clustering mode in this\ngeometry. In the following we will sometimes omit the\nword \"lowest\" in this context.\n\nFIG. 3: The density field \u03c1 = 1 + 0.1 J1 (r/l\u03ba ) cos(\u03b8) for the\nlowest marginally stable clustering mode m = 1.

For a comparison with\nthe clustering modes we need to express the critical radius for the m = 0 shear mode in units of l\u03ba . For a\ngas of hard disks Rs = 2.56781 . . . l\u03ba , whereas for a gas\nof hard spheres Rs = 3.75053 . . . l\u03ba . Therefore, one always has Rs > R1 , and the clustering mode bifurcates, in\nthe circular geometry, at a smaller container radius than\nthe shear mode. This is in contrast to what happens in\nrectangular geometries, where a shear mode goes unstable first [35, 38, 39]. An interesting feature of the shear\nmodes in a circular container is that they exhibit zonal\nflows. This is because the flow must have a zero angular\nmomentum, as imposed by Eqs. (11), (16) and (18). One\nexample is shown in Fig. 4 which depicts the velocity\nfield of the lowest m = 0 mode.\n\nwith Eq. (8) as the boundary condition. It is convenient\nto rescale the variables: the pressure by its characteristic\ninitial value p0 , the density by the average density \u03c10 , the\ncoordinates x, y by the critical length l\u03ba which appears\nin Eq. (20), and the time by the characteristic cooling\ntime\n2\n.\n(31)\ntc =\n1/2 1/2\n\u039b\u03c10 p0\nThe rescaled problem is the following:\n\u0012r\n\u0013\n\u1e57\n1 1\n1/2\n= \u22122\u03c1\n+ \u2207*\n,\n\u2207\n\u03c1 \u03c1\np3/2\n\u2202\u03c1\n(r = R) = 0,\n\u2202r\n\n4\n2\n0\n\n(32)\n(33)\n\nwhere we abuse notation by denoting the rescaled quantities by the same symbols as the physical ones. Averaging\nEq. (32) over the (rescaled) area of the container, we obtain a global balance equation for the pressure\n\n\u22122\n\u22124\n\n\u1e57\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFIG. 4: The velocity field \u03b4u = J1 (r/l\u03bd )\u03b8\u0302 of the lowest\nmarginally stable shear mode. R = 5.13562 . . . l\u03bd . Evident\nis a zonal flow.\n\nFor the no-slip condition at r = R the analysis is\nvery similar. Here the critical radius Rs for the shear\nmode is determined from equation J1 (R/l\u03bd ) = 0. As\na result, Rs = 1.91585 . . . l\u03ba for hard disks, and Rs =\n2.79828 . . . l\u03ba for hard spheres. Both values exceed the\ncritical radius R1 = 1.84118 . . . l\u03ba for inhomogeneous\nclustering. Therefore, for the no-slip boundary, the first\nbifurcation to occur as the system size is increased is\nagain the clustering mode bifurcation. Notably, a zonal\nflow is absent for the no-slip boundary.\n\nIV.\n\nEq. (3) the pressure gradient must be zero, \u2207p = 0. The\ndensity distribution \u03c1(r) and the evolution in time of the\npressure p(t) are governed by the energy equation (6)\nwhich becomes\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\n1\n1\n\u1e57 = \u2212\u03b3p\u2207*v+\u03ba0 p3/2 \u2207* \u221a \u2207\n\u2212\u039b\u03c11/2 p3/2 , (30)\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\nNONLINEAR CLUSTERING IN A\nCIRCULAR CONTAINER\n\nAs we have just found, the clustering mode m = 1 is\nthe first mode to become unstable as the container radius\nR exceeds R1 = 1.84118 . . . l\u03ba . One possible scenario of\nthe evolution of the unstable m=1 mode is the formation of an inhomogeneous density distribution of the gas\nwith no mean flow, v = 0. This state can continuously\nbifurcate from the HCS. In view of Eq. (2) this density\ndistribution must be time-independent. In addition, from\n\np3/2\n\n= \u22122h\u03c11/2 i,\n\n(34)\n\nwhere h. . . i denotes averaging over the area of the circular container. Thus, the time-independent density profiles are determined from the nonlocal problem\n1 2 \u22123/2\n\u2207 \u03c1\n+ h\u03c11/2 i \u2212 \u03c11/2 = 0,\n3\n\u2202\u03c1\n(r = R) = 0.\n\u2202r\n\n(35)\n\nThis problem is a generalization to 2D of the similar\nproblem for a narrow-channel flow [36]. A 3D version\nof this equation was derived by Fouxon [37]. He discussed spherically-symmetric solutions with a single density maximum at r = R. In 2D these correspond to the\nlowest m = 0 mode, see Fig. 2. As the m = 1 mode\nactually goes unstable first in a circular container, any\nazimuthally-symmetric solution of Eq. (35) must be unstable with respect to perturbations breaking this symmetry. We checked that a similar feature persists in 3D:\nthe first mode to become unstable as the radius of a\nspherical container is increased from zero is not spherically symmetric. As a result, in a spherical container,\nthe spherically-symmetric solutions reported in Ref. [37]\nmust be unstable with respect to perturbations breaking this symmetry. The azimuthally- and sphericallysymmetric solutions (in 2D and 3D, respectively) be\ncome, however, relevant in narrow-sector (correspondingly, narrow-cone) shaped containers, where heat diffusion erases any non-radial structure. We will deal with\n\n\f7\nthe narrow-sector geometry later on, in section V. In\nthis section we continue to deal with a circular container.\nFirst of all, we will perform a weakly nonlinear analysis\nof Eq. (35) to determine the character of bifurcation of\nthe HCS. As we will see, the bifurcation at hand is a\npitchfork bifurcation, where the state parameter (a density contrast defined below) grows as a square root of\nthe difference between the container radius and the critical radius. A pitchfork bifurcation can be either supercritical, or sub-critical [42], thus determining the stability of states below and above the bifurcation. Since this\nimportant characteristic is determined by the sign of a\nnumerical coefficient, an accurate calculation is needed\nto ascertain it.\nA.\n\nwhere, according to our marginal stability analysis, \u03c61 =\nJ1 (\u03c7) cos(\u03b8). In the second order in \u01eb we obtain\n\n\u2202\u03c62\n(R\u03031 , \u03b8) = 0.\n\u2202\u03c7\n\n1\n1\n\u03b60 (\u03c7) + \u03b62 (\u03c7) cos(2\u03b8),\n(41)\n3\n3\nwhere the radial functions \u03b60 and \u03b62 are solutions of the\nforced Bessel equations\n\u03c62 =\n\nL\u0302m \u03b6m = J12 (\u03c7); m = 0, 2,\n\nEquation (35) can be simplified by a transformation of\nthe unknown function \u03c1 and of the rescaled radial coordinate r:\nr = A\u22122 r\u0303,\n\nwhere A = h\u03c1 i. We obtain a parameter-free nonlinear\nPoisson equation with a Neumann boundary condition at\nr\u0303 = R\u0303 \u2261 A2 R:\n\n(37)\n\nOnce \u03a6 is found, A can be determined from A\u22122 =\nh\u03a6\u22122/3 ir\u0303 , where the averaging is over the circular container of rescaled radius R\u0303. The latter relation follows\nfrom the condition h\u03c1i = 1 for the rescaled density \u03c1.\nIn the new coordinate r\u0303, the critical radius for instability of the mode m = 1, found in section III C, is\nR1 = R\u03031 = 1.841 . . . . Let us consider a circular container with a radius slightly above or below R1 and seek\nfor a weakly-nonlinear solution of Eq. (37).

Figure 5\npresents the bifurcation diagram alongside with its extension obtained by numerical integration of Eq. (38) (using\nthe pdenonlin algorithm of the Matlab PDE toolbox)\nand transformation back to the (rescaled) original variables. The well-known properties of supercritical bifurcations in 1D [42] make it possible to determine the stability\nof the branches shown in Fig. 5 without further calculations. The arrows in Fig. 5 schematically show the direction of the evolution of the flow depending on whether\nthe branch is stable or unstable. We found that the maximum density of the unstable states diverges at a finite\nsubcritical container radius, R \u2243 1.7795 \u2243 0.9666 R1,\nsee Fig. 5b. This suggests that this is a critical radius\nseparating, in a proper space of parameters, the flows to\nthose which approach the HCS from those which do not.\nFigure 6 shows the numerically calculated density map\nof the \"border state\" corresponding to this critical radius\nof the container.\nOne salient feature of the bifurcation diagram in Fig.\n5 is that there are no stable time-independent inhomogeneous solutions at R > R1 . This result is in a striking contrast with that for the narrow-channel geometry, where the pitchfork bifurcation for the clustering\nmode is super -critical, and where the energy loss and\nheat diffusion balance each other to produce stable timeindependent inhomogeneous states [36]. What is then the\nultimate state of a freely cooling granular gas at R > R1 ?\nB.\n\nHydrodynamic simulations in a circular\ncontainer\n\nOur first step in answering this question was performing a series of 2D hydrodynamic simulations in this geometry, see Appendix A for the computational details. After a proper rescaling the time-dependent hydrodynamic\nequations include only one dimensionless parameter, proportional to 1 \u2212 \u03b12 , see Ref. [36] and Appendix A. We\nchose the restitution coefficient \u03b1 = 0.94868 . . . which\ncorresponds to \u01eb1 = \u03ba0 \u039b/2 = 1 \u2212 \u03b12 = 0.1. The hydrodynamic equations, subject to boundary conditions\n(8) and (9), were solved with the (zero-viscosity) Vulcan/2D code, see Appendix A. An Eulerian numerical\nscheme on a non-uniform polar mesh was used. Here\nwe present the results of a typical simulation, performed\nin (one half of a) circular container of rescaled radius\n\n(a)\n\n\u03c1max\n\n1.3\n1.2\n1.1\n1\n1.836\n\n1.838\n\n1.84\n\n1.842\n\nR\n15\n(b)\n10\n\u03c1max\n\nNow we can determine the form of the bifurcation diagram in the (rescaled) original coordinates.

Figure 7 shows density map snapshots at different\n(rescaled) times. One can see that the gas develops a\ndensity peak at the point r = R, \u03b8 = 0. Figure 8 shows\nthe evolution of this density peak in time. The numerical\nrun was stopped when the (rescaled) maximum density\nreached about 300, and a considerable amount of gas\nwas already concentrated in a region comparable with\nthe mesh size. One can see that, until this time, the\ndensity growth accelerates in time.

TIME-INDEPENDENT INHOMOGENEOUS\nCOOLING STATES IN A NARROW SECTOR\n\nIn a narrow-sector-shaped container the heat diffusion\nsuppresses any flow structure in the azimuthal direction.\nThis setting, therefore, defines a purely radial (1D) flow\nwhile retaining an essential 2D feature: polar metrics.\nAs the (azimuthally-asymmetric) m = 1 clustering\nmodes are now suppressed, the first mode that goes unstable, as the sector radius R is increased from zero, is\nthe lowest m = 0 clustering mode, see Sec. IIC. Let the\nsector radius be slightly larger than the critical radius\nR0 = 3.83171l\u03ba for the lowest m = 0 mode. The unstable m = 0 mode will start to grow. What is the longtime behavior of the gas in this geometry? To answer\nthis question, we will first identify a time-independent\ninhomogeneous solution: a possible candidate for the description of a long-time behavior. We will show that the\nbifurcation of the HCS is trans-critical here, and determine its sign by performing a weakly nonlinear analysis.\nA.\n\nBifurcation analysis\n\nLet the rescaled sector radius be slightly larger, or\nslightly smaller, than R0 = 3.83171 . . . . We again use the\ntransformed equation (37).

The\nquantities are plotted in rescaled units.\n\nIt is clear from this calculation that, at least for system\nsizes close to R0 , the cooling gas has two possible steadydensity states. The first is the HCS \u03c1 = 1. The other is\nan inhomogeneous state where, for R < R0 , the density\nis peaked at the vertex of the sector, and for R > R0\nthe density is peaked at the arc. Several examples of\ndensity profiles of these inhomogeneous states, obtained\nby numerical integration of Eq. (50), are shown in Fig.\n9.\n\nEquation (55) describes a trans-critical bifurcation [42]\nin which two states \"collide\" and exchange their stability. The bifurcation parameter is \u03b4R. As R increases,\nthe HCS remains stable until R = R0 . Here the HCS\n\"surrenders\" its stability to the inhomogeneous state.\nCorrespondingly, the inhomogeneous state is unstable at\nR < R0 . The bifurcation diagram of the system is shown\nin Fig. 10 a.\nThe bifurcation diagram can be extended beyond\nthe weakly-nonlinear regime by numerical integration of\nEq. (50). Figure 10 b shows the computed stable branch\nof the inhomogeneous solutions at R > R0 , and the unstable branch at R < R0 . Note the exponential dependence, at large radii, of the maximum density on the\nsector radius. It has the same origin as the exponential\nsystem-size dependence of the maximum density of the\ninhomogeneous cooling state in a long narrow channel\n[36]. Our numerics show that the unstable branch ends\nat R \u2243 3.25, where \u03c1(R) \u2243 0.77. That is, there are no\ntime-independent inhomogeneous solutions for the density at smaller radii.

There are no stable states, however, when starting below the unstable branches, see Fig.\n10. This suggests that, as in the circular container, the\ncooling gas develops thermal collapse.

In Fig. 11 one can see the\nradial density profile for R = 7.57.\nThe bifurcation diagram in Fig. 10 suggests a \"phase\ndiagram\" of the cooling gas in the sector geometry. Let\nus denote the time-independent inhomogeneous solution\nof Eq. (35) in a sector of radius R by \u03c1I (r; R). Consider\na continuous one-parameter family of initial conditions\nsuch that the density profile is a linear combination of\nthe inhomogeneous solution \u03c1I (r; R) and the HCS \u03c1 = 1:\n\u03c1(r, t = 0) = C\u03c1I (r; R) + 1 \u2212 C,\nv(r, t = 0) = 0,\np(r, t = 0) = 1.\n\n(56)\n\nThe constants are chosen so that h\u03c1i = 1. Let us identify\nan arbitrary point [R, \u03c1] of the plane of Fig. 10 with this\ninitial condition. Then the constant C is determined by\n\nTHERMAL COLLAPSE IN 2D\n\nReduced ideal hydrodynamics close to\nsingularity\n\nThat a freely cooling dilute granular gas exhibits thermal collapse, in any dimension, within the framework of\nideal granular hydrodynamics, is by now well established\n[24, 29, 30, 36, 37]. In this subsection we will derive a set\nof reduced ideal hydrodynamic equations which describe\nthermal collapse in 2D. In the next subsection we will\nobtain scaling laws, in time and in space, which characterize the thermal collapse. Then we will check whether\nheat diffusion and other processes, that we will neglect,\ncan become relevant near the singularity.\nAssuming that thermal collapse does happen, and that\nheat diffusion and viscosity are irrelevant in the vicinity\n(both in time, and in space) of the density singularity, one\ncan considerably simplify the hydrodynamic equations\nEqs. (2), (3) and (6). In the light of results of Refs.\n[24, 29, 30, 36, 37], an important additional simplification\ncomes from the assumption that the gas pressure in the\ncollapse region is approximately uniform. In a formal\nlanguage, see e.g. Ref. [41], we eliminate the acoustic\nmodes by postulating a perturbation expansion for the\ngas pressure,\np(r, t) = p(0) (t) + p(1) (r, t) + . . . , p(1) \u226a p(0) ,\n\n(58)\n\nlimit ourselves to the leading-order approximation, p =\np(0) (t), and discard the momentum equation (3). Finally,\nwe neglect both terms in the left hand side of Eq. (6), as\nthey remain bounded at the density singularity, and keep\nonly terms which blow up at the singularity. We arrive\nat the following reduced equations:\n\u2202\u03c1\n+ \u2207 * (\u03c1v) = 0,\n\u2202t\n\u03b3ps\u22121/2 \u2207 * v = \u2212\u039b\u03c11/2 ,\n\n(59)\n(60)\n\nwhere ps is the gas pressure at singularity. Equation (60)\ndescribes a balance between the adiabatic compression\nheating and the inelastic cooling.\n\n\f12\nSet of equations (59) and (60) is not closed, as there\nare only two scalar equations for the density and the two\nvelocity components. To obtain an additional equation,\nfor the velocity, one should go to the subleading order in\nEq. (58), as it was done in Ref. [41] in the case of a 2D\ngas flow driven by heat diffusion. Instead, we will make\nanother simplifying assumption: that the gas flow near\nthermal collapse is (at least locally) azimuthally symmetric. Note that, if thermal collapse develops at the\nvertex of a narrow-sector-shaped container, this assumption is satisfied trivially. For an azimuthally-symmetric\nflow Eqs. (59) and (60) make a closed set.\nB.\n\nHere, a generic density profile near the singularity has a\nquadratic dependence on r:\n\u03c10 (r) \u2243 a \u2212 br2 ,\n\nwhere a > 0 and b > 0. Using this local profile we can\ncalculate, for this \"initial condition\", the local asymptote\nm(r) near r = 0:\nZ r\na\nd\u22121 \u2032\nm(r) =\n\u03c10 (r\u2032 )r\u2032\ndr \u2243 rd ,\n(67)\nd\n0\nin the leading order in r. Therefore,\n\nScaling laws of thermal collapse\n1/2 1/2\n\nLet us rescale t by ts = 2\u03b3/(\u039bps \u03c10 ), \u03c1 by the average gas density \u03c10 , r by l\u03ba and v by l\u03ba /ts . Then, for a\nd-dimensional thermal collapse (azimuthally symmetric\nin 2D or spherically symmetric in 3D) Eq. (60) acquires\na parameter-free form:\n\u0001\n1 \u2202\nrd\u22121 v = \u22122\u03c11/2 ,\nrd\u22121 \u2202r\n\n(61)\n\nwhere r is a local radial coordinate with the origin at the\npoint of developing singularity. Substituting Eq. (61) in\nEq. (59) we obtain\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202\u03c1\n+v\n= 2\u03c13/2 .\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\n\n(62)\n\nThis equation becomes very simple in Lagrangian coordinates which transform the full time derivative on the\nleft-hand-side into a simple time derivative. We can define a Lagrangian mass coordinate\nZ r\nd\u22121 \u2032\nm(r, t) =\n\u03c1(r\u2032 , t)r\u2032\ndr ,\n(63)\n0\n\nd\u22121\n\nr\nbeing the metric in d dimensions. Up to a ddependent factor, m(r, t) is the mass of the gas contained\nin a d-dimensional sphere of radius r around the point of\ndeveloping singularity. After the transformation Eq.

The solution is\nw(m, t) = \u2212t + w0 (m),\n\n(65)\n\nwhere w0 (m) is the initial condition (with a minimum at\nm = 0) which should be chosen at time when the reduced\nset of equations (59) and (60) already holds. The time of\nsingularity is therefore t\u2217 = w0 (0). The scaling laws near\ncollapse are determined by the behavior of the function\nw0 (m) at small m. To elucidate this behavior, let us return to the density \u03c1 in the original Eulerian coordinates.\n\n(66)\n\n\u0012 \u00132/d\nd\n\u03c10 (m) \u2243 a \u2212 b\nm2/d .\na\n\n(68)\n\nw0 (m) \u2243 a\u22121/2 + c m2/d ,\n\n(69)\n\nThis follows\n\nwhere c > 0 is a constant. Now we see that the density blowup occurs at t\u2217 = a\u22121/2 . Now we return to\nEq. (65) and observe that, sufficiently close to the singularity point, the solution is self-similar:\nw(m, t) \u2243 t\u2217 \u2212 t + c m2/d = \u03c4 W (m/\u03c4 d/2 ) ,\n\n(70)\n\nwhere \u03c4 = t\u2217 \u2212 t and W (z) = 1 + c z 2/d. Transforming\nback to the Eulerian coordinate, we obtain\n\u0012 \u2032 \u0013\nZ m\nZ m\nm\ndm\u2032\n\u2032 2\n2\ndm\n\u03c4\nW\n=\nd\nrd = d\n\u2032 , t)\nd/2\n\u03c1(m\n\u03c4\n0\n0\n\u0010 m \u0011\n= \u03c4 2+d/2 F\n,\n(71)\n\u03c4 d/2\n\nwhere F (. . . ) is a shape function. Equations (70) and\n(71) yield the dynamical length scale of the ideal singularity\nl \u223c (t\u2217 \u2212 t)\u03b2 , \u03b2 = 1/2 + 2/d.\n\n(72)\n\nFor d = 1 (the narrow-channel geometry) we obtain \u03b2 =\n5/2, in agreement with the result of Fouxon et al. [29, 30],\nwhereas for d = 2 and 3 we obtain new exponents \u03b2 = 3/2\nand 7/6, respectively. The density asymptote close to the\nsingularity can be written as\n\u03c1(r, t) = \u03c4 \u22122 \u03a8(\u03be) ,\n\n(73)\n\nwhere \u03be = r/\u03c4 \u03b2 is the similarity variable, and \u03a8 is a\nshape function such that \u03a8(0) = 1. The density blows\nup at r = 0 as \u03c1 = (t\u2217 \u2212 t)\u22122 independently of dimension\n[37].\nAt large distances, r \u226b l (but still much smaller than\nan external length scale of the flow) the density exhibits\na time-independent power-law tail. Indeed, at m \u226b \u03c4 d/2\nasymptote (70) becomes w(m, t) \u2243 c m2/d . Then, using\nEq. (71), we obtain rd \u223c m1+4/d . As a result,\nd2\n\nm \u223c r d+4\n\n(74)\n\n\f13\nand\n\u03c1(r \u226b l) \u223c r\u03b7 , \u03b7 = \u2212\n\n2\n4d\n=\u2212 .\n4+d\n\u03b2\n\n(75)\n\nFor d = 1 this yields \u03b7 = \u22124/5, in agreement with Refs.\n[29, 30], whereas for d = 2 and 3 one obtains new exponents \u03b7 = \u22124/3 and \u221212/7, respectively.\nTo find the scaling relations for the gas velocity we\nintegrate Eq. (61)\nZ r\n2\nd\u22121 \u2032\nv(r, t) = \u2212 d\u22121\n\u03c11/2 r\u2032\ndr ,\n(76)\nr\n0\nand change to the self-similar coordinate \u03be:\n\u03b2\u22121\n\nv(r, t) = \u2212\n\n2\u03c4\n\u03be d\u22121\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03be\n\n\u03a81/2 (\u03be \u2032 )\u03be \u2032d\u22121 d\u03be \u2032 \u2261 \u2212\u03c4 \u03b2\u22121 V (\u03be).\n\n(77)\nWhen \u03be \u226b 1, the velocity field exhibits a timeindependent power-law tail, V \u223c \u2212\u03be \u03bc , where \u03bc = 1\u22121/\u03b2.\nAgain, for d = 1 we recover the previous result \u03bc = 3/5\n[29, 30]. In 2D \u03bc = 1/3, in 3D \u03bc = 1/7.\nC.\n\nCan heat diffusion arrest thermal collapse?\n\nDoes heat diffusion, unaccounted for in ideal description, arrest the collapse? In 1D the answer to this question is affirmative [36]. What happens in higher dimensions? Using the scaling relations in the vicinity of thermal collapse, that we have just found, we can estimate\nthe ratio of the heat diffusion term to the cooling term.\nIn the original units of Eqs. (2)-(6) we obtain:\np\n\n\u03ba0 \u2207 * [ p/\u03c1 \u2207(p/\u03c1)]\n\u039b\u03c11/2 p3/2\n\n\u0013\u22122\n\n\u223c\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c1 l\n\u03c10 l \u03ba\n\n\u223c\n\n\u0012\n\nt\u2217 \u2212 t\nts\n\n\u00133\u2212 d4\n\n.\n\n(78)\n\nOne can see that the case of d = 1 is dramatically different from the cases of d = 2, 3. For d = 1 heat diffusion\ncannot be neglected when time is sufficiently close to the\nt\u2217 . As the heat diffusion is a stabilizing factor, one can\nargue that, in this case, it may arrest thermal collapse.\nIndeed, it was shown in Ref. [36] that, in the narrowchannel geometry, heat diffusion ultimately balances the\nunstable density growth, and a time-independent density\nprofile sets in. On the contrary, for d = 2 or 3 the heat\ndiffusion remains irrelevant and cannot arrest the density\nblowup.\nEstimate (78) implies that, in a narrow-sector-shaped\ncontainer, thermal collapse is only possible exactly at\nthe vertex and not in any other location. Indeed, let\nr = rs > 0 be such another location. The differential of\nthe local Lagrangian coordinate, measured from r = rs ,\nis proportional to dr. This setting is essentially 1D, and\nso heat diffusion will arrest the collapse [36]. On the\n\ncontrary, the differential of the Lagrangian coordinate,\nmeasured from r = 0, is proportional to rdr. That is, it\nis essentially 2D, and the scaling laws of the ideal singularity persist in spite of the heat diffusion.\nIn Appendix B we checked the consistency of other\nassumptions behind the reduced ideal set of equations\n(59) and (60). As it turns out, one assumption \u2013 about\nthe (almost) uniform pressure profile \u2013 breaks down at\nt very close to ts . We will briefly discuss this issue in\nsection VII.\nD.\n\nHydrodynamic simulations in a narrow sector\n\nTo test our theoretical predictions for a narrow-sector\ngeometry, we solved numerically the rescaled hydrodynamic equations, see Appendix A. We assumed that the\nhydrodynamic fields depend only on the radial coordinate, whereas v\u03b8 = 0, and used the zero-viscosity Vulcan/1D code, see Appendix A. Here we will describe two\ndifferent simulations for R = 1.3R0 (above the critical\nradius for the lowest m = 0 mode). The restitution coefficient \u03b1 = 0.994987 . . . was chosen to satisfy the relation\n\u03ba0 \u039b/2 = 1\u2212\u03b12 = 0.01, whereas \u03b3 was taken to be 2. The\nfirst initial condition describes an isobaric configuration\nwith a density peak at r = R:\n\u0014\n\u0010 \u03c0r \u0011\u0015\n4\n,\n\u03c1(r, t = 0) = 1 \u2212 0.3 2 + cos\n\u03c0\nR\nv(r, t = 0) = 0,\np(r, t = 0) = 1.\n(79)\nHere we should expect, see Fig. 10, that the density\nprofile will approach the corresponding time-independent\ninhomogeneous solution that we found in section V. This\nis indeed what the simulated dynamics shows, see Fig.\n13.\nThe second initial condition differs from the first in\nthat the initial density is now peaked at the vertex r = 0:\n\u0014\n\u0010 \u03c0r \u0011\u0015\n4\n\u03c1(r, t = 0) = 1 + 0.3 2 + cos\n\u03c0\nR\nv(r, t = 0) = 0,\np(r, t = 0) = 1.\n(80)\nThe bifurcation diagram, see Fig. 10, suggests that the\ngas will develop thermal collapse. The simulated history\nof the gas density at the vertex is depicted in Fig. 14.\nShown is the inverse square root of the density versus\ntime. This time dependence is in excellent agreement,\nuntil the latest simulation times we could reach, with the\nfinite-time density blowup \u03c1(r = 0, t) \u223c (t\u2217 \u2212 t)\u22122 . Next\nwe turn to the spatial behavior of the evolving density\nprofiles. Figure 15 shows, in a log-log scale, several density profiles at different times. It is evident that, as the\ngas density blows up at the vertex, the density profile develops a time-independent power-law tail with exponent\n\u22124/3 as predicted by our reduced ideal theory.\n\n\f14\n11\n\n10\n\n2.5\n\n5\n\n4\n\n2\n7\n\n3\n\n1.5\n\n4\n\n10\n\nr\u22124/3\n\n2\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c1\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n0.5\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n10 \u22128\n10\n\n5\n\n\u22125\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\nr\n\nr\nFIG. 13: (Color online.)

The dynamical length scale of thermal collapse versus the time to singularity for the hydrodynamic simulation with initial conditions (80). The dashed line\nis shown to guide the eye.\n\nFinally, most of our analytical results were obtained\non the assumption that the gas pressure in the vicinity of thermal collapse remains uniform. We tested this\nassumption directly by following the simulated pressure\nprofiles at different times. Figure 19 shows several pressure profiles in the whole sector, and a closeup in a vicinity of r = 0. One can see that, as thermal collapse progresses, the pressure remains close to uniform in the external region but exhibits some steepening near r = 0.\nAs the gas density varies by several orders of magnitude\nduring these times, the spatial and temporal variations of\nthe pressure are insignificant. At the end of the simulation, the spatial length scale of the pressure is still much\nlarger (by more than two orders of magnitude) than the\ndynamic length scale l(t). That is, the pressure remains\nclose to uniform in the (shrinking with time) collapse\nregion. Still, the pressure steepening may signal a future breakdown of the uniform-pressure approximation\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have found that, in a circular container, the critical\nradius of the container for the clustering mode instability of a dilute nearly elastic granular gas is smaller than\nthat for the shear mode instability. This is in contrast\nwith rectangular geometry, where the shear mode bifurcates at a smaller system size than the clustering mode\n[10, 35, 38, 39]. This fact enabled us to investigate a\nstrongly nonlinear dynamics of a linearly unstable clustering mode in a 2D setting, without worrying about the\nshear mode. We have presented analytic and numeric evidence for thermal collapse, unarrested by heat diffusion,\nin a freely cooling dilute granular gas in 2D. Our results\nimply that Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics of dilute granular gases exhibits, in dimension higher than one, finitetime density blowups. This is in striking contrast to the\n\"wave breaking\" singularities of an ideal flow (both in a\n\"classical\" gas [4], and in a granular gas [29, 30]) which\nare arrested by the viscosity and heat diffusion, bringing\nabout smooth shock-wave solutions.\nWe have derived the dynamic scaling laws of thermal collapse by assuming a locally uniform pressure profile. All the scaling laws, and the uniform-pressure scenario, have been corroborated in our hydrodynamic simulations. An order-of-magnitude estimate, presented in\nAppendix B, suggests that the uniform-pressure scenario\nmust break down sufficiently close to the singularity. We\nhave not observed this breakdown in our hydrodynamic\nsimulations: the uniform-pressure scenario agreed very\n\n\f16\nwell with the simulations until the latest simulation times\nwe were able to reach. This may be related to some\nsmall numerical factors which improve the applicability\nof the uniform-pressure scenario beyond what our orderof-magnitude estimate predicts. Future work should address this issue and find out whether the uniform-pressure\nscenario gives way to the zero-pressure scenario where a\ndifferent type of singularity \u2013 that of a free flow \u2013 develops [22, 28].\nIt would be interesting to investigate the hydrodynamics of clustering in a free cooling granular gas in 3D. One\ncan speculate that the 2D singularities, analyzed in this\nwork, are the generic type of singularity in 3D. Indeed, a\nlocally-2D pinching may be more common than a fully3D collapse.\nThe dynamic scaling laws, that describe the density singularity, provide a sharp characterization of a\nstrongly nonlinear stage of clustering instability. When\nthe growing-in-time gas density peak reaches a fraction\nof the close-packing density \u223c \u03c3 \u2212d , the dilute hydrodynamic equations break down. Our solutions describing thermal collapse represent, therefore, an intermediate asymptotic of the true flow. Importantly, the duration of this intermediate asymptotic can be made arbitrary long if the average density of the gas is made\nsufficiently small compared with the close-packing density. Furthermore, the appearance of singularities in the\ndilute-hydrodynamic solutions signals the formation of\nclosely-packed clusters of particles. The details of formation and dynamics of the closely-packed regions are obviously beyond a dilute-gas hydrodynamic description.\nA satisfactory description of granular gases at moderate densities (at a fraction of the close-packing density)\nis provided by a Navier-Stokes granular hydrodynamics\nwith the equation of state of Carnahan and Starling [44]\nand semi-empiric transport coefficients derived from kinetic theory in the spirit of Enskog approach [45]. A hydrodynamic description at even higher densities is even\nmore challenging, although some particular flow regimes\nat very high densities have been successfully described\nby using empirical constitutive relations [12, 46\u201348] and,\nwhen necessary, by taking into account a multi-phase\ncharacter of the flow [49, 50].\n\nAppendix A. Hydrodynamic simulations\n\nWe solved numerically a rescaled and transformed version of hydrodynamic equations Eqs. (2)-(5). The rescaling reduces considerably the number of relevant parameters, whereas the transformation dramatically reduces\nthe computation time.\nThe rescaling procedure is essentially the same we used\nat the beginning of section IV: the coordinates x, y are\nrescaled by the characteristic length scale l\u03ba which appears in Eq. (20), the time by the characteristic cool1/2 1/2\ning time tc = 2/(\u039b\u03c10 p0 ), the gas velocity by l\u03ba /tc ,\nthe density by the average density \u03c10 , and the temperature by its typical initial value T0 .

Neither of the\nsource terms involves any derivatives, and so they could\nbe easily implemented in our numerical codes. Importantly, a time-dependent cooling state with a stationary\ndensity in the original formulation corresponds to a true\nsteady state, for all variables, in the transformed equations.\nTwo different hydrodynamic codes, Vulcan/1D (V1D)\nand Vulcan/2D (V2D), were used for a numerical solution of Eqs. (A4)-(A6). The codes involve ALE (Arbitrary Lagrange-Euler) schemes on staggered grids and\nhave both explicit and implicit solvers for hydrodynamics and heat conduction [51]. V1D mainly works in the\nLagrangian mode and therefore can efficiently handle 1D\ndensity singularities. V2D is naturally limited to Eulerian simulations. It can employ, however, a strongly nonuniform polar mesh. This feature of the code was very\nimportant when following the developing singularity in a\ncircular container, see section IV B. The two codes were\npreviously tested against other codes and used for a variety of astrophysical problems, as well as for granular\nhydrodynamic simulations [25\u201330].\n\nof the gas varies as lf ree \u223c 1/\u03c1 \u223c (t\u2217 \u2212 t)2 . Therefore,\nlf ree\n\u223c (t\u2217 \u2212 t)1/2 \u2192 0 ,\nl\n\nand the applicability of hydrodynamics improves near the\nsingularity.\nFinally, we will check whether the pressure profile remains locally uniform near the singularity. This amounts\nto checking whether the correction p(1) (r, t), which we\nneglected in the perturbative expansion (58), is indeed\nmuch smaller than the term p(0) (t). To evaluate p(1) we\nreturn to Eq. (3) and plug in it the (supposedly leadingorder) quantities found in section VI B:\n\u2202p(1)\n= \u2212\u03c1\n\u2202r\n\n\u223c 1 \u2212 \u03b12 \u226a 1 .\n\n(B1)\n\nTherefore, for nearly elastic collisions (that we assume\nthroughout this work), the viscous heating remains small\nand, in the leading order, can be neglected.\nThe validity of hydrodynamics itself at the density\nblowup demands that the Knudsen number remains\nsmall, see Eq. (1). As we have seen in section VI B,\nthe smallest hydrodynamic scale varies with time, in 2D,\nas l \u223c (t\u2217 \u2212 t)3/2 . On the other hand, the mean free path\n\n[1] B.A. Trubnikov, S.K.

Verifying assumptions a posteriori\n\nAs we have seen in subsection VI C, heat diffusion is\nirrelevant for thermal collapse in 2D or 3D. Let us check\nother assumptions that we made in order to derive the\nscaling relations for thermal collapse.\nWhen using ideal equations, we neglected the viscous\nheating term in the energy equation (5) or (6). The ratio\nof this term to the energy loss term can be estimated as\np\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121 \u0010\n\u03bd0 (\u03b3 \u2212 1) p/\u03c1 \u03a3\u03022\nv \u00112\n\u03bd0 \u039b \u03c1 p\nts\n\u223c\n2\n\u03c10 p s\nl\n2\u039b\u03c11/2 p3/2\n\n(B2)\n\n(B4)\n\nAs \u2202r p(1) \u223c p(1) /l, the viscous term does not violate the\nstrong inequality p(1) \u226a p(0) .\nFinally, let us estimate the inertial terms:\n\u03c1\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202v\n\u2202v\n+v\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\n\n\u0013\n\n\u223c\n\n\u03c1v 2\nps\n\u223c \u03ba0 \u039b\nl\nl\n\n\u0012\n\nt\u2217 \u2212 t\nts\n\n\u00132\u03b2\u22124\n\n.\n\n(B5)\n\nTherefore, the contribution of the inertial terms to p(1)\nis such that\np(1)\n\u223c (1 \u2212 \u03b12 )\np(0)\n\n\u0012\n\nt\u2217 \u2212 t\nts\n\n\u0013 d4 \u22123\n\n.\n\n(B6)\n\nOne can see that, in the limit of nearly elastic collisions,\n1 \u2212 \u03b12 \u226a 1, the ratio p(1) /p(0) is small at early times.\nHowever, for d = 2 or 3 it grows without limit as t \u2192 t\u2217 .\nThis suggests that the uniform-pressure approximation\nbreaks down sufficiently close to the time of singularity.\n\n[7] J.D.
