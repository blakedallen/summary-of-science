We demonstrate that\nquantum systems in the eigenstates of Pauli group operators are capable of encoding mathematical axioms and show that Pauli group quantum measurements are capable of revealing whether or\nnot a given proposition is logically dependent on the axiomatic system. Whenever a mathematical\nproposition is logically independent of the axioms encoded in the measured state, the measurement\nassociated with the proposition gives random outcomes. This allows for an experimental test of\nlogical independence. Conversely, it also allows for an explanation of the probabilities of random\noutcomes observed in Pauli group measurements from logical independence without invoking quantum theory. The axiomatic systems we study can be completed and are therefore not subject to\nG\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem.\n\nAs opposed to the case of classical statistical physics, the theorems by Kochen and Specker [1] and Bell [2] opened\nup the possibility to view probabilities in quantum physics as irreducible and not as stemming from our ignorance\nabout some (non-contextual or local) predeterminated properties. Adopting this view, one can ask if there is any\nreason why such irreducible probabilities should have different values at all. Here we show that-at least in a certain\nsubset of measurements (Pauli group measurements)-quantum probabilities can be seen as following from logical\nindependence of mathematical propositions which are associated to the measurements without invoking quantum\ntheory itself.\nAny formal system is based on axioms, which are propositions that are defined to be true. Whenever a proposition\nand a given set of axioms together contain more information than the axioms themselves, the proposition can neither\nbe proved nor disproved from the axioms \u2013 it is logically independent (or mathematically undecidable [3, 4]). If\na proposition is independent of the axioms, neither the proposition itself nor its negation creates an inconsistency\ntogether with the axiomatic system.\nWe demonstrate that the states of quantum systems are capable of encoding mathematical axioms. Quantum\nmechanics imposes an upper limit on how much information can be encoded in a quantum state [5, 6], thus limiting\nthe information content of the set of axioms. We show that quantum measurements are capable of revealing whether\na given proposition is independent or not of the set of axioms. Whenever a mathematical proposition is independent\nof the axioms encoded in the state, the measurement associated with the proposition gives random outcomes. This\nallows for an experimental test of logical independence by realizing in the laboratory both the actual quantum states\nand the required quantum measurements. Our axiomatic systems can be completed and are therefore not subject to\nG\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem [7, 8].\nIntuitively, independent propositions contain entirely new information which cannot be reduced to the information\nin the axioms. This point of view is related to Chaitin's information-theoretical formulation of logical independence\n[3, 4]: Given a set of axioms that contains a certain amount of information, it is impossible to deduce the truth value\nof a proposition which, together with the axioms, contains more information than the set of axioms itself.\nTo give an example, consider Boolean functions of a single binary argument:\nx \u2208 {0, 1} \u2192 y = f (x) \u2208 {0, 1}\n\n(1)\n\nThere are four such functions, yk (k = 0, 1, 2, 3), shown in Figure 1. We shall discuss the following (binary) propositions\nabout their properties:\n(A)\n\n\"The value of f (0) is '0', i.e. f (0) = 0.\"\n\n(B)\n\n\"The value of f (1) is '0', i.e. f (1) = 0.\"\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: The four Boolean functions y = f (x) of a binary argument, i.e. f (x) = 0, 1 with x = 0, 1. The different functions are\nlabeled by yk with k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nThese two propositions are logically independent. Knowing the truth value of one of them does not allow to infer the\ntruth value of the other. Ascribing truth values to both propositions requires two bits of information. If one postulates\nonly proposition (A) to be true, i.e. if one chooses (A) as an 'axiom', then it is impossible to prove proposition (B)\nfrom (A). Having only axiom (A), i.e. only this one bit of information, there is not enough information to know also\nthe truth value of (B). Hence, proposition (B) is logically independent from the system containing the single axiom\n(A). Another example of an independent proposition within the same axiomatic system is:\n(C)\n\n\"The function is constant, i.e. f (0) = f (1).\"\n\nAgain, this statement can neither be proved nor disproved from the axiom (A) alone because (C) is independent of\n(A) as it involves f (1).\nWe refer to such independent propositions to which one cannot simultaneously ascribe definite truth values \u2013 given\na limited amount of information resources \u2013 as logically complementary propositions. Knowing the truth value of one\nof them precludes any knowledge about the others. Given the limitation of one bit of information encoded in the\naxiom, all three propositions (A), (B) and (C) are logically complementary to each other.\nWhen the information content of the axioms and the number of independent propositions increase, more possibilities\narise. Already the case of two bits as the information content is instructive. Consider two independent Boolean\nfunctions f1 (x) and f2 (x) of a binary argument. The two bits may be used to define properties of the individual\nfunctions or they may define joint features of the functions. An example of the first type is the following two-bit\nproposition:\n(D)\n\n\"The value of f1 (0) is '0', i.e. f1 (0) = 0.\"\n\"The value of f2 (1) is '0', i.e. f2 (1) = 0.\"\n\nAn example of the second type is:\n(E)\n\n\"The functions have the same value for argument '0', i.e. f1 (0) = f2 (0).\"\n\"The functions have the same value for argument '1', i.e. f1 (1) = f2 (1).\"\n\nBoth (D) and (E) consist of two elementary (binary) propositions. Their truth values are of the form of vectors with\ntwo components being the truth values of their elementary propositions. The propositions (D) and (E) are logically\ncomplementary. Given (E) as a two-bit axiom, all the individual function values remain undefined and thus one can\ndetermine neither of the two truth values of elementary propositions in (D).\nA qualitatively new aspect of multi-bit axioms is the existence of \"partially\" independent propositions, i.e. propositions that contain more than one elementary proposition of which only some are independent. An example of such\na partially independent proposition within the system consisting of the two-bit axiom (D) is:\n(F)\n\n\"The value of f1 (0) is '0', i.e. f1 (0) = 0.\"\n\"The value of f2 (0) is '0', i.e. f2 (0) = 0.\"\n\nThe first elementary proposition is the same as in (D) and thus it is definitely true. The impossibility to decide the\nsecond elementary proposition leads to partial independence of proposition (F). In a similar way, proposition (F) is\npartially independent of the axiomatic system of (E).\nThe discussion so far was purely mathematical. We have described finite axiomatic systems (of limited information\ncontent) using properties of Boolean functions. Now we show that the independence of mathematical propositions\n\n\f3\ncan be tested in quantum experiments. To this end we introduce a physical \"black box\" whose internal configuration\nencodes Boolean functions. The black box hence forms a bridge between mathematics and physics. Quantum systems\nenter it and the properties of the functions, i.e. the truth values of propositions, are written onto the quantum states\nof the systems. Finally, measurements performed on the systems extract information about the properties of the\nconfiguration of the black box and thus about the properties of the functions.\nWe begin with the simplest case of a qubit (e.g. a spin- 21 particle or the polarization of a photon) entering the black\nbox in a well-defined state and a single bit-to-bit function f (x) encoded in the black box. Inside the black box two\nsubsequent operations alter the state of the input qubit. The first operation encodes the value of f (1) via application\nf (1)\nf (0)\nof \u03c3\u0302z , i.e. the Pauli z-operator taken to the power of f (1). The second operation encodes f (0) with \u03c3\u0302x , i.e. the\nPauli x-operator taken to the power of f (0). The total action of the black box is\n\u00db = \u03c3\u0302xf (0) \u03c3\u0302zf (1) .\n\n(2)\n\nConsider the input qubit to be in one of the eigenstates of the Pauli operator imn \u03c3\u0302xm \u03c3\u0302zn (with i the imaginary\nunit). The three particular choices (m, n) = (0, 1), (1, 0), or (1, 1) correspond to the three Pauli operators along\northogonal directions (in the Bloch sphere) \u03c3\u0302z , \u03c3\u0302x , or \u03c3\u0302y = i \u03c3\u0302x \u03c3\u0302z , respectively. The measurements of these operators\nare quantum complementary: Given a system in an eigenstate of one of them, the results of the other measurements\nare totally random. The input density matrix reads\n\u03c1\u0302 =\n\n1\n2\n\n[11 + \u03bbmn imn \u03c3\u0302xm \u03c3\u0302zn ] ,\n\n(3)\n\nwith \u03bbmn = \u00b11 and 11 the identity operator. It evolves under the action of the black box to\n\u00db \u03c1\u0302 \u00db \u2020 =\n\n1\n2\n\n[11 + \u03bbmn (\u22121)nf (0)+mf (1) imn \u03c3\u0302xm \u03c3\u0302zn ] .\n\n(4)\n\nDepending on the value of n f (0) + m f (1) (throughout the paper all sums are taken modulo 2), the state after\nthe black box is either the same or orthogonal to the initial one. If one now performs a measurement in the basis of\nthe initial state, (i.e. the eigenbasis of the operator imn \u03c3\u0302xm \u03c3\u0302zn ), the outcome reveals the value of n f (0) + m f (1) and\nhence the measurement can be considered as checking the truth value of the proposition\n(G)\n\n\"n f (0) + m f (1) = 0.\"\n\nIt is crucial to note that each of the three quantum complementary measurements \u03c3\u0302z , \u03c3\u0302x , or \u03c3\u0302y \u2013 given the suitable\ninitial state \u2013 reveals the truth value of one of the independent propositions (A), (B), or (C), respectively.\nIndependent of the initial state, we now identify the quantum measurement (m, n) with the question about the\ntruth value of the corresponding mathematical proposition (G). Those states that give a definite (i.e. not random)\noutcome in the quantum measurement encode (G) or its negation as an axiom. For example, the two eigenstates of\n\u03c3\u0302z after the black box encode (A) or its negation as an axiom, and the \u03c3\u0302z measurement reveals the truth value of the\nproposition (A). This one bit is the maximal amount of information that can be encoded in a qubit [5, 6].\nWhen a physical system prepared in an eigenstate of a Pauli operator is measured along complementary directions,\nthe measurement outcomes are random. Correspondingly, the proposition identified with a complementary observable\nis independent from the one-bit axiom encoded in the measured state. For example, the measurement of \u03c3\u0302x on an\neigenstate of \u03c3\u0302z gives random outcomes, and accordingly proposition (B) is independent of the one-bit axiom (A).\nThis links logical independence and quantum randomness in complementary measurements. We propose that it is\ntherefore possible to experimentally find out whether a proposition is logically independent or not, as summarized in\nFigure 2.\nIn a single experimental run it is impossible to infer whether the outcome is definite or random and thus whether\nit stemmed from a dependent or independent proposition. Therefore, any quantum experiment revealing logical\nindependence requires many runs. (It can be shown that \u2013 given a certain level of noise \u2013 the probability to infer\nwrongly whether the proposition is dependent or not decays exponentially with the length of the outcome string.)\nGeneralizing the above reasoning to multiple qubits, we show in the following that whenever the proposition\nidentified with a Pauli group measurement is dependent (on the axioms encoded into the qubits), the measurement\n\n\feigenstate of \u03c3\u0302z gives random outcomes, and accordingly proposition (B) is undecidable within the one-bit axiom\n(A). This links mathematical undecidability and quantum randomness in complementary measurements. We propose\nthat it is therefore possible to experimentally find out whether a proposition is decidable or not, as summarized in\n4\nFigure 2.\nMathematics/Logic\n\nQuantum Physics\n\nAxioms of limited information content\nBoolean functions\nQuestion about proposition\nLogical dependence/independence\n\n\u2194\nQuantum states\n\u2194\nUnitary transformations\n\u2194\nQuantum measurement\n\u2194 Definiteness/Randomness of outcomes\n\nIn a single experimental\nrun\nis impossible\ninfer independence\nwhether the and\noutcome\nis definite\nor random and thus whether\nFIG.\n2: it\nThe\nlink betweentological\nquantum\nrandomness.\nit stemmed from a decidable or undecidable proposition.

If one measures the operator of the Pauli group [11]\n\u0398\u0302 \u2261 i\u03b11 \u03b21 \u03c3\u0302x\u03b11 \u03c3\u0302z\u03b21 \u2297 * * * \u2297 i\u03b1N \u03b2N \u03c3\u0302x\u03b1N \u03c3\u0302z\u03b2N ,\n\n(7)\n\nwith \u03b1j , \u03b2j \u2208 {0, 1}, one tests whether the proposition\n(J)\n\n\"\n\nPN\n\nj=1 [\u03b2j\n\nfj (0) + \u03b1j fj (1)] = 0.\"\n\nis dependent or not. The proposition (J) can be represented as the 2N -dimensional proposition vector J~ =\n(\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1N , \u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2N ) with binary entries. Therefore, there are 4N different (J)'s. For all dependent proposi~ p = (m1 (p), . . . , mN (p), n1 (p), . . . , nN (p)) representing\ntions, the vectors J~ are linear combinations of the vectors H\nPN\n~\n~\nthe axioms, i.e. J = p=1 kp Hp . Since \u03b1j , \u03b2j are binary, the coefficients must also be binary: kp \u2208 {0, 1}. This gives\n2N dependent propositions (J). The corresponding operators \u0398\u0302 can be written as the products \u03a9\u0302k11 * * * \u03a9\u0302kNN . In this\ncase \u0398\u0302 commutes with all the \u03a9\u0302p 's, and the quantum mechanical formalism implies that the measurement of \u0398\u0302 has a\ndefinite outcome. The measurements of all the remaining 4N \u2212 2N = 2N (2N \u2212 1) operators \u0398\u0302 give random outcomes,\nand the corresponding propositions (J) are independent. Note that there are many more independent propositions\nof the form (J) than dependent ones. The ratio between their numbers increases exponentially with the number of\nN\nN\nqubits, i.e. 2 (22N \u22121) = O(2N ).\nIn logic, one can always complete the axiomatic system by adding new axioms to the set of (Hp ) such that any\nproposition (J) becomes dependent. However, this would require the axioms to be encoded in more than N qubits.\nHaving only N qubits, projecting these qubits into new quantum states, and propagating them through their black\nboxes, new propositions can become axioms but only if some or all previous axioms become independent propositions.\nThis is a consequence of the limited information content of the quantum system.\nWe have proved that a proposition of the type (J) is dependent on the axiomatic system (Hp ) if and only if the\ncorresponding measurement \u0398\u0302 from the Pauli group is commuting with all \u03a9\u0302p . Note that one does not need to first\nprove the (in)dependence of a proposition by logic before one is able to identify the experiment to test it. For a given\n\n\f5\nset of (Hp ), defining an N -bit axiom, one must prepare a joint eigenstate of N commuting operators \u03a9\u0302p . In order to\ntest the logical (in)dependence of a new proposition (J), one needs to measure the operator \u0398\u0302 that corresponds to\n(J) in this state. The procedures of preparation and measurement can be performed without knowing whether (J) is\nlogically independent of the set of (Hp ).\nThe measurement \u0398\u0302 is highly degenerate because it tests the logical (in)dependence of the binary proposition (J)\nof the axioms. Less degenerate measurements are possible which simultaneously test the logical (in)dependence of\nseveral elementary propositions of the form (J). Such multi-bit propositions contain many elementary propositions. If\nnot all of them are independent of the axioms, this gives rise to partial independence. This provides an explanation\nfor different values of outcome probabilities in Pauli group measurements, which is based on logic without invoking\nquantum theory. A measurement corresponding to any single independent elementary proposition (with two possible\nmeasurement outcomes) gives uniformly random results. In a measurement whose outcomes reveal the independence\nof m independent elementary propositions (with 2m possible measurement outcomes) these outcomes occur with\nprobabilities 21m . (The results revealing dependence of elementary propositions are always definite.)\nTo illustrate the idea of multi-bit propositions and partial independence, consider the two bits of proposition\n(E) described above correspond to the set of independent commuting operators \u03a9\u03021 = \u03c3\u0302z \u2297 \u03c3\u0302z and \u03a9\u03022 = \u03c3\u0302x \u2297 \u03c3\u0302x .\nThe common eigenbasis of these operators is spanned by the maximally entangled Bell states (basis bE ): |\u03a6\u00b1 i =\n\u221a1 (|z+i |z+i \u00b1 |z\u2212i |z\u2212i ), |\u03a8\u00b1 i = \u221a1 (|z+i |z\u2212i \u00b1 |z\u2212i |z+i ), where e.g. |z\u00b1i denotes the eigenstate with\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n2\nthe eigenvalue \u00b11 of \u03c3\u0302z for the first qubit. Thus, after the black boxes the four Bell states encode the four possible\ntruth values of the elementary propositions in (E) and a so-called Bell State Analyzer [13] (i.e. an apparatus that\nmeasures in the Bell basis) reveals these values. In the same way, the truth values of the elementary propositions\nin (F) are encoded in the eigenstates of local \u03c3\u0302z bases, i.e. by the four states |z\u00b1i1 |z\u00b1i2 (basis bF ). Finally, the\nelementary propositions in (D) are linked with the four product states |z\u00b1i1 |x\u00b1i2 (basis bD ). In general, if all the\naxioms involve joint properties of Boolean functions the multi-partite state encoding these axioms must be entangled.\nMeasurements in the Bell basis, bE , prove that the entangled state indeed encodes joint properties of the two\nfunctions, i.e. information about (E). Measurements in other bases can then be interpreted in terms of \"partial\" and\n\"full\" independence. Proposition (D) is fully independent given (E) as an axiom and the four possible measurement\nresults are completely random with probabilities of 41 . On the other hand, proposition (F) is partially independent,\nwhich is disclosed by the fact that two (out of four) outcomes never occur, while the two remaining occur randomly,\ni.e. each with probability 12 .\nWhen the outcome of a quantum measurement is definite, it need not possess an a priori relation to the actual truth\nvalue of a dependent proposition as imposed by classical logic. This can be demonstrated for three qubits initially in\nthe Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state [14]\n|GHZi =\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n(|z+i1 |z+i2 |z+i3 + |z\u2212i1 |z\u2212i2 |z\u2212i3 ) .\n\n(8)\n\nWe choose as axioms the propositions\n(K1 )\n\n\"f1 (0) + f1 (1) + f2 (0) + f2 (1)\n\n(K2 )\n\n\"f1 (0) + f1 (1)\n\n(K3 )\n\n\"\n\n+ f3 (1) = 1.\"\n\n+ f2 (1) + f3 (0) + f3 (1) = 1.\"\n\nf1 (1) + f2 (0) + f2 (1) + f3 (0) + f3 (1) = 1.\"\n\nlinked with the operators \u03c3\u0302y \u2297 \u03c3\u0302y \u2297 \u03c3\u0302x , \u03c3\u0302y \u2297 \u03c3\u0302x \u2297 \u03c3\u0302y , and \u03c3\u0302x \u2297 \u03c3\u0302y \u2297 \u03c3\u0302y , respectively. One can logically derive from\n(K1 ) to (K3 ) the true proposition\n(L)\n\n\"f1 (1) + f2 (1) + f3 (1) = 1.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the proposition (L) is identified with the measurement of \u03c3\u0302x \u2297 \u03c3\u0302x \u2297 \u03c3\u0302x , but the result imposed\nby quantum mechanics corresponds to the negation of (L), namely: \"f1 (1) + f2 (1) + f3 (1) = 0.\" This is the heart of\nthe GHZ argument [14\u201316]. In the (standard logical) derivation of (L) the individual function values are well defined\nand the same, independently of the axiom (Ki ) in which they appear. Since this is equivalent to the assumption of\nnon-contextuality [1, 17], the truth values of dependent propositions found in quantum experiments do not necessarily\nhave to be the same as the ones derived by classical logic. Nonetheless, there is a one-to-one correspondence between\n\n\f6\ndefiniteness (or randomness) of the measurement outcomes and the associated propositions being dependent (or\nindependent) within axiomatic set. As shown above, this correspondence is independent of the rules used to infer the\nspecific truth values of the propositions (e.g. classical logic or quantum theory).\nOne might raise the question whether a classical device can be constructed to reveal the independence of propositions. All operations in the experimental test belong to the Clifford group subset of quantum gates and therefore\ncan be efficiently simulated classically [11, 18, 19]. A classical device is possible, provided one uses more resources: N\nclassical bits are required to propagate through the black box in order to specify the N -bit axiomatic set and additional\nbits are required to model randomness in measurements corresponding to independent propositions. (Specifically, 2N\nclassical bits propagating through the black box are known to be sufficient to specify definite outcomes in the measurements corresponding to the axioms and random outcomes in the measurements of fully independent propositions\n[20, 21].) Such a device can give the truth values of dependent propositions according to classical logic. On the level\nof elementary physical systems, however, the world is known to be quantum. It is intriguing that nature supplies us\nwith physical systems that can reveal logical dependence but cannot be used to learn the classical truth values.\nA historic point finally deserves comment. The inference that classical logic cannot capture the structure of\nquantum mechanics was made by Birkhoff and von Neumann and started the field of quantum logic [22]. Our\nlink between mathematics/logic and certain elements of quantum physics is related to, but yet distinct from their\napproach. Quantum logic was invented to provide an understanding of quantum physics in terms of a set of nonclassical logical rules for propositions which are identified with projective quantum measurements. However, \"one\nrequires the entire theoretical machinery of quantum mechanics to justify quantum logic\" [23]. Our approach aims at\nproviding a justification for quantum randomness starting from an operational representation of purely mathematical\npropositions and systems with limited information content.\nThe no-go theorems of Bell [2] and Kochen and Specker [1] prove that quantum randomness cannot be understood\nas stemming from the ignorance of a hidden variable substructure without coming into conflict with local realism and\nnon-contextuality. This suggests that quantum randomness might be of irreducible (objective) nature [24, 25] and a\nconsequence of fundamentally limited information content of physical systems, namely N bits in N qubits [6]. If one\nadopts this view, the present work explains in which experiments the outcomes will be irreducibly random, namely\nin those that correspond to logically independent propositions.\nAfter leaving the black boxes the N qubits' quantum states encode exactly N bits of information about Boolean\nfunctions, i.e. the systems encode an N -bit axiom, and the other logically complementary propositions are independent\nof this axiom. If there exists no underlying (hidden variable) structure, no information is left for specifying their truth\nvalues. However, the qubits can be measured in the bases corresponding to independent propositions, and \u2013 as in any\nmeasurement \u2013 will inevitably give outcomes, e.g. \"clicks\" in detectors. These clicks must not contain any information\nwhatsoever about the truth value of the independent proposition. Therefore, the individual quantum outcomes must\nbe random, reconciling logical independence with the fact that a quantum system always gives an \"answer\" when\n\"asked\" in an experiment. This provides an intuitive understanding of quantum randomness, a key quantum feature,\nusing mathematical reasoning. Moreover, the same argument implies that randomness necessarily occurs in any\nphysical theory of systems with limited information content in which measurements are operationally identified with\nasking questions about independent propositions [26].\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that the dependence or independence of certain mathematical propositions\nin a finite axiomatic set can be tested by performing corresponding Pauli group measurements. (It would be interesting to investigate the possiblity of extending our results beyond this class of measurements.) This is achieved via\nan isomorphism between axioms and quantum states as well as between propositions and quantum measurements.\nDependence (Independence) is revealed by definite (random) outcomes. Having this isomorphism, logical independence needs not to be proved by logic but can be inferred from experimental results. From the foundational point of\nview, this sheds new light on the (mathematical) origin of quantum randomness in these measurements. Under the\nassumption that the information content of N elementary physical systems (i.e. qubits) is fundamentally restricted to\nN bits such that no underlying (hidden variable) structure exists, measurement outcomes corresponding to logically\nindependent propositions must be irreducibly random.\nAcknowledgements.

The single photons are generated in the process\nof spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) [9]. The horizontal/vertical linear, +45\u25e6 /\u221245\u25e6 linear, right/left\ncircular polarization of the photon corresponds to eigenstates |z\u00b1i, |x\u00b1i, and |y\u00b1i of the Pauli operators, respectively.\nWe start by initializing the qubit in a definite polarization state by inserting a linear polarizer in the beam path. The\nqubit then propagates through the black box in which the Boolean functions are encoded with the help of half-wave\nf (0) f (1)\nplates (HWP) which implement the product of Pauli operators \u03c3\u0302x \u03c3\u0302z , eq. (2). Subsequently, measurements of\n\u03c3\u0302z , \u03c3\u0302x , and \u03c3\u0302y , which test the truth value of a specific proposition, are performed as projective measurements in the\ncorresponding polarization basis. Specifically, to perform \u03c3\u0302z measurements we use a polarizing beam-splitter (PBS)\nwhose output modes are fiber-coupled to single-photon detector modules and use wave plates in front of the PBS to\nchange the measurement basis.

The black box encodes two classical bits, f (0) and f (1), and the measurement is chosen such that the single bit f (0),\nf (1), or f (0) + f (1), is read out. For every input state we measure in all three complementary bases, i.e., z [asking for f (0)],\nx [f (1)], and y [f (0) + f (1)], shown from left to right. The three measurements are related to three logically complementary\nquestions (A), (B), (C) of the main text as indicated by the labels. This particular plot is the experimentally obtained data\nfor the black box realizing the function y1 . Similar results were obtained for the other black box configurations y0 , y2 , and y3 .\nGreen (blue) bars represent outcomes \"0\" (\"1\") in the respective detectors, giving the answer to the corresponding question.\nEach input state, after leaving the black box, reveals the truth value of one and only one of the propositions, i.e. it encodes a\none-bit axiom. Given this axiom, the remaining two logically complementary propositions are independent. This independence\nis revealed by complete randomness of the outcomes in the other two measurement bases. Statistical errors are at most 0.03 %\nin each graph and therefore not visible.\n\n\fNormalized count rates\n\n8\n1\n\n\u0424+\n\n0.8\n\ntrue\n\n0.6\n\npartially independent\n0.4\n\nindependent\n\n0.2\n\n00 01 10 11 00 01 10 11 00 01 10 11\nf1 (0) + f2(0) = ?\nf1 (1) + f2 (1) = ?\n\nf1 (0) = ?\nf2 (0) = ?\n\nfalse\n\nf1 (0) = ?\nf2(1) = ?\n\nFIG. 4: In this two-qubit experiment a \u03a6+ Bell state is measured in three different bases (the Bell basis as well as |z\u00b1i1 |z\u00b1i2\nand |z\u00b1i1 |x\u00b1i2 , shown from left to right). Plotted are the normalized count rates associated with the relevant detector\ncombinations for the black box encoding function y2 on both photons. The first (second) label gives the answer to the upper\n(lower) question. The results of the measurements performed in the Bell basis show that the two qubits encode proposition (E)\nof the main text. The data in the middle plot reveal partial independence of proposition (F), given (E) as an axiom, as indicated\nby the random outcomes in two out of four detector combinations. In contrast, the right plot presents the data corresponding\nto the fully independent proposition (D), where the outcomes are completely random. Similar results for propositions (E), (F)\nand (D) were obtained for other black box encodings. The reason for the fact that the Bell state in the left plot is not identified\nwith unit fidelity stems from imperfections in the experimental setup (cf. Reference [28]). Unequal detector efficiencies explain\nthe small bias in the right plot. Statistical errors are at most 2 % for the left plot and at most 0.1 % for the other plots and\ntherefore not visible.\n\ntwo output modes of the PBS.\nFirst, we confirm that complementary quantum measurements indeed reveal truth values of respective logically\ncomplementary propositions. To achieve this we prepare the system in a state belonging to the basis in which we\nfinally measure. Specifically, we verify that a measurement in the z basis gives the value of f (0) and similarly,\nmeasurements in x and y bases give the value of f (1) and f (0) + f (1), respectively.\nNext, we demonstrate that dependent (independent) propositions are identified by a sequence of definite (random)\noutcomes of quantum measurements. For each of the three choices of the initial state, we \"ask\" all three logically\ncomplementary questions by measuring in all three different complementary bases. Figure 3 shows that for every\ninput state one and only one question has a definite answer. This is the axiom encoded in the system leaving black\nbox. The remaining propositions are independent given that axiom. This is signified by the observation that the\ncorresponding measurement outcomes are completely random, i.e. evenly distributed.\nIn the case of two Boolean functions, f1 (x) and f2 (x), we prepare two-photon states with the help of SPDC. The\nencoding of these functions within the black boxes is done akin to the single-qubit case. We start our investigation by\nconfirming that the truth values of the (elementary) propositions in (E), (F) and (D) are revealed by measurements\nperformed in the bases bE , bF and bD of the main text, respectively. As in the single-qubit case, preparation and\nmeasurement are in the same basis (results not shown). Next, we prepare the |\u03a6+ i Bell state and measure it in the\nbases bE , bF and bD . As can be seen in the left plot of Figure 4, measurements in the Bell basis, bE , prove that the\nentangled state indeed encodes joint properties of the functions f1 (x) and f2 (x), i.e. information about (E). These joint\ntwo-qubit measurements require a so-called Bell State Analyzer (BSA) [13, 27, 28], the heart of which is a non-linear\ngate, such as a controlled-NOT gate [29\u201332]. For experimental details see Reference [28]. Measurements in other bases\ncan then be interpreted in terms of \"partial\" and \"full\" independence. Proposition (D) is fully independent given (E)\nas an axiom encoded into the photons leaving the black boxes. This can be seen from the right part in Figure 4, in\nwhich all four measurement outcomes occur with equal probability. On the other hand, proposition (F) is partially\nindependent. This is experimentally revealed by the count distribution of the middle part in Figure 4. The partial\nindependence is disclosed by the randomness of the two occurring outcomes, while the other two outcomes do not\nappear.\n\n\f9\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2020\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n[30]\n[31]\n[32]\n\nPresent address: Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore, 3 Science Drive 2, 117543 Singapore,\nSingapore\nPresent address: Complex Systems Research Group, HNO, Medical University of Vienna, W\u00e4hringer G\u00fcrtel 18-20, 1090\nWien, Austria\nS.
