Symmetric Dicke states are generated as an example, and the experimental feasibility and challenge of our scheme are discussed.\nPACS numbers: 03.67.Bg, 03.67.Lx, 71.55.-i, 76.30.Mi\n\nOver past years, negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy\n(N-V) centers in diamond have been considered as one of\nthe most promising candidates for solid-state quantum\ninformation processing (QIP) due to their long coherence\ntime at room temperature [1]. The intensive experimental studies have been paid on quantum logical gating [2],\nstate storage and transfer [3], and preparation of entangled states [4], using the electron-spin and the nearby\nnuclear spins within a single diamond.\nIn the context of a large-scale diamond-based QIP, the\ngeneration of multipartite entangled states among distant N-V centers is of particular importance and experimental challenge. One of the proposed approaches is\nto use the measurement-based QIP scheme [5]. By detecting the emitted photons which have been entangled\nwith different N-V electron spins, distant N-V centers\ncan be entangled in a nondeterministic way. Such an\napproach has the major advantage that no direct interactions among qubits are required, which implies a relatively easy control. An alternative is the scalable optical\ncoupling between N-V centers and high-Q microcavities\n[6]. By sharing the common modes of a microcavity or\nsharing flying single-photon pulses, the remote N-V centers could be coherently manipulated or entangled, which\nmay open up the possibilities of N-V-based scalable QIP.\nTo have an efficient processing of quantum information, however, we prefer deterministic manipulations. In\nthe present work, we will show the possibility to entangle\nmultiple N-V centers by a nano-mechanical cantilever in\na deterministic fashion. We had noticed a recent work\nfor a strong magnetic coupling between electron-spin degrees of freedom of a N-V center and a nano-mechanical\nresonator [7, 8]. In our case, we have a line of N-V centers, each of which is located in a nanoscale diamond. We\nwill show how to generate the symmetric Dicke states [9],\n(m)\ndenoted by |Dn i with equally weighted superposition\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: mangfeng@wipm.ac.cn\naddress: djf@ustc.edu.cn\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) (a) Schematic of the physical system\nconsisting of an array of N-V centers strongly coupled to the\nquantized motion of a cantilever with length l, width w and\nthickness \u03c4 .

We restrict our study to the\ndown state ms = 0 and the up state ms = \u22121 by driving a\nmicrowave field.\n\nof all permutations of m excitations among n particles,\nby global addressing. Such multipartite entangled states\nown great properties of robustness against decoherence\nand particle loss and have been observed experimentally\nwith linear optics systems [10]. The favorable features of\nour scheme include the deterministic preparation of entangled electron-spin states between N-V centers and the\npotential to be scaled up with near future technologies.\nBesides, as a scheme with global addressing, only a microwave field is required during the entanglement preparation, which greatly reduces the experimental time and\ndifficulty. Furthermore, our proposed scheme could be\nrealized with very high fidelity due to our fast manipulations and the long decoherence time of electron spins in\nN-V centers.\n\n\f2\nAs sketched in Fig. 1(a), an array of evenly spaced\nmagnetic tips are attached at the end of a nanomechanical cantilever, under which are n one-to-one correspondent N-V centers. In order to entangle the electron\nspins in spatially separate N-V centers by a cantilever,\nwe have to couple the electron spins to the motion of the\nresonator. This can be achieved by exposing the electron spins to the magnetic field gradient created by the\nmagnetic tips. For clarity of our description, we label\n\u03bbj = \u03c7e Bgj z0j (j = 1, 2, * * * n) as the coupling strength,\nwhere Bgj = |\u2202z Btipj |, z0j is the zero-point amplitude of\nthe cantilever regarding the j th tip and \u03c7e is the chargemass ratio of an electron. For simplicity, we assume that\nall the N-V centers are equally coupled to the cantilever\n(\u03bbj = \u03bb), which could be achieved by elaborately adjusting the magnetic field gradient of the tips and the\ndistances between the tips and the corresponding N-V\ncenters. Furthermore, in most part of the paper, we will\nneglect the influence from the nuclear spins, which implies a pure N-V center without 13 C doped or with well\npolarized nuclear spins of 13 C or 15 N [11]. For our purpose, we encode qubits in two sublevels: ms = 0 and\nms = \u22121 of the ground triplet state, and a microwave\nfield will be employed to drive the two sublevels. As a\nresult, the Hamiltonian of the whole system can be written in units of ~ = 1 as\nPn\n\u2020\nj=1 \u03c90 | \u2212 1ij h\u22121| + \u03bda a\n\u0001\nP\nn\n\u03a9j (t)\ni\u03c9j t\n+ | \u2212 1ij h0| e\u2212i\u03c9j t\n+ j=1 2 |0ij h\u22121| e\nPn\n+ j=1 \u03bb2 (a + a\u2020 )\u03c3zj ,\n(1)\nwhere \u03c90 \u2248 Dgs \u2212 \u03c7e |Bext | is the energy splitting between sublevels |0i and | \u2212 1i under the externally applied magnetic field Bext along z axis, i.e., the quantization axis, Dgs (around 2.87 GHz [12]) is the zero-field\nsplitting between the spin levels\u0001ms = 0 and ms = \u00b11\nshown in Fig. 1(b). \u03bd and a a\u2020 are the frequency and\nannihilation (creation) operator of the motional mode of\nthe cantilever. \u03a9j (t) and \u03c9j are the Rabi frequency and\nthe frequency of the microwave regarding the cantilever\ncoupling to the jth N-V center, and \u03c3zj = | \u2212 1ij h\u22121| \u2212\n|0ij h0|. For simplicity, we may assume in following treatment \u03a9j (t) = \u03a9(t) and \u03c9j = \u03c9 (j = 1, 2, * * * n).

Therefore, using Eq. (3), we may\nachieve various kinds of multiple entangled states. As an\nexample, we will show below how to prepare symmetric\nDicke states of the electron spins in distant N-V centers\nby global microwave addressing.\nWe consider a Si cantilever beam of length l = 5 \u03bcm,\nwidth w = 50 nm and thickness \u03c4 = 50 nm with effective\nmass M \u2243 7.28 \u00d7 10\u221218 kg, resonant frequency of the\nlowest-order flexural mode \u03bd \u2243p14.87 MHz and the zeropoint amplitude of fluctuation 1/(2M \u03bd) \u2243 6.98\u00d710\u221213\nm [13].

After performing\nMS transformation, we obtain a three-level subsystem\nplus two additional two-level subsystems [See Fig. 3(a)].\nThe effective Hamiltonian reads as\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u22122\u03b4(t)\n\u03bb\n0\nq\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(2)\n\u03bb\n\u2212\u03b4(t) \u03bb 32 \uf8f7\n(5)\nHef f = \uf8ec\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\nq\n0\n\n\u03bb\n\n3\n2\n\n0\n\nin the basis {|\u03be1 i|0ip , |\u03b71 i|1ip , |\u03c7i|2ip } , where |\u03be1 i =\n(2)\n(1)\n|D3 i, |\u03b71 i = |D3 i and |\u03c7i = | \u2212 \u2212\u2212i. It is easy to\ncheck by setting \u03b4(t) = 0 that the population proba(2)\nbility of |D3 i will only reach 0.95. In order to gener(2)\nate |D3 i with higher probability, we will employ adiabatic techniques as below. The top state |\u03be1 i and\nthe bottom state |\u03c7i in Fig. 3(b) can be interchanged\nthrough adiabatic passages under the adiabatic condi(2)\ntion: max hEl (t)| \u2202t Hef f |Ek (t)i/[Ek (t) \u2212 El (t)]2 \u226a 1\nt\u2208[ti ,tf ]\n\n(l 6= k), where |Ek i and Ek are the instantaneous eigenstates and eigeN-Values of Eq. (5). In Fig. 3(c), the\npopulations of |\u03be1 i, |\u03b71 i and |\u03c7i are numerically calculated from Eq. (5), where we have assumed a purely\nlinear microwave chirp (using sawtooth pulse of the microwave). By addressing the three N-V centers globally,\n(2)\nwe could achieve the population probability of |D3 i to\nbe higher than 0.99 through this adiabatic passage.\nWith similar steps to the above cases for three N-V\n(m)\ncenters, a generalization to |Dn i with n > m > 3 is\nstraightforward.\nIn the above treatment, we have assumed the N-V centers to be equally coupled to the cantilever. In realistic\ncase, however, the coupling should be slightly different\ndue to imprecision. Figure 4(a) demonstrates a simplified case for the fidelities of the produced states under\nthe relative error of the coupling strength \u2206, defined by\n\u03bbn = [1\u2212(n\u22121)\u2206]\u03bb, where the fidelities still remain high\nin the case of the small relative error.\nThe main decoherence sources associated with our implementation are dephasing of the electron spins and\nthe intrinsic heating of the cantilever. Since our operation for the symmetric Dicke states could be accomplished on the time scale of 1.8 \u223c 30 \u03bcs, which\nis much shorter than the reported electron-spin relaxation time T1 = 6 ms [4] as well as the dephasing time\nT2 = 350 \u03bcs [17] induced by the nuclear-spin fluctuation inside a N-V center. Thus, the influence on the\nN-V electron-spin from the intrinsic damping and dephasing is negligible. On the other hand, as the cantilever is ultra-sensitive to the magnetic force generated\nbetween the tips and the N-V electron spins [13, 14, 18],\nwe will concentrate on the heating effect of the can(k)\ntilever by the master equation \u2202t \u03c1 = \u2212i[Hef f , \u03c1]+L\u03c1\nwith k =1, 2 [corresponding to Eqs. (4) and (5), respec\u0001\ntively], where L\u03c1 = \u0393(n\u0304th +1) 2a\u03c1a\u2020 \u2212 a\u2020 a\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1a\u2020 a /2+\n\u0001\n) \u2212 1]\n\u0393n\u0304th 2a\u2020 \u03c1a \u2212 aa\u2020 \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1aa\u2020 /2, n\u0304th = 1/[exp( k~\u03bd\nBT\nand kB is the Boltzmann constant. In general, the heating factor of the cantilever is described by \u0393 = \u03bd/Q [13],\nwhere \u03bd and Q are the vibrational frequency and the\nquality factor of a cantilever. Numerical calculations are\nperformed for the fidelities of the Dicke states in Fig.\n(1)\n(2)\n4(b), where the fidelities of |D3 i and |D3 i could reach\n0.998 and 0.996 respectively in the case of the Q value\n105 . If the Q value is lowered to 104 , the fidelity drops\n(1)\n(2)\nto 0.985 for |D3 i and to 0.957 for |D3 i.\n\n\f4\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n1\n0.98\n\n0.9999\nF\n\nFidelity\n\nFidelity\n\n1\n\n(1)\n\n|D >\n3\n\n0.9998\nF\n\n0.96\n0.94\n\n(2)\n\n|D >\n3\n\n0.9997\n0\n\n0.005\n\n0.01\n\n\u2206\n\n0.015\n\n0.02\n\n0.92\n\u22126\n10\n\n(1)\n\n10\n\n\u22125\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n\u0393(MHz)\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n(2)\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) The fidelity of symmetric Dicke states |D3 i (solid line) and |D3 i (dashed line) versus (a) relative\nerror \u2206 of the coupling strength; (b) heating factor \u0393 of the cantilever.\n\nWe address some remarks for experimental issues of\nour scheme. To make sure that the N-V centers are all\nstrongly and nearly equally coupled to the cantilever,\nwe have to restrict the tips within a small region near\nthe head of the cantilever, which implies a limitation of\nthe number for available N-V centers (at most tens of\nN-V centers in our present design). So a potential for\nscalability with our scheme might be to combine with\nthe non-deterministic method [5]. Besides, we require\nnanoscale diamonds with a single N-V center in each and\nthe N-V centers should be located very close to the surface of the diamonds. To our knowledge, such diamond\nnanoparticles are not in principle unavailable although\nthey have not yet been achieved experimentally. On the\nother hand, due to the small spacing between adjacent\nN-V centers, individual addressing with a microwave field\nis of difficulty. As a result, although entanglement could\nbe achieved with global operations, to carry out universal\nquantum computing, we may have to employ the nearfield optical technique [19] with spatial resolution of the\norder of tens of nanometers, which had been widely used\nin optics and surface science, and recently also employed\nfor QIP [20]. Alternatively, a magnetic field gradient\nalong x-axis would help to distinguish different qubits in\nfrequency space. Thus universal QIP is available, and\n\n[1] F. Jelezko et al., Phys. Rev.

Young et al., New\n\nrobust quantum gating, such as composite pulse method\n[21] or bang-bang control [22], employed previously could\nbe straightforwardly applied to our scheme. Finally, cooling a cantilever with many magnetic tips to a required\nlow temperature (114 \u03bcK in our design) could be of great\ntechnical difficulty with current technology but may be\nresolved by recently presented cooling schemes [7, 8].\nFurther consideration would iN-Volve nuclear spins\nwhich are good at storing quantum information due to\nthe long decoherence time [23]. In this sense, we may\nalso consider to encode the qubits in the nuclear spins,\nand employ the electron spins as ancillas. The hyperfine\ninteraction helps to transfer the generated entanglement\nof electron spins to the corresponding nuclear spins of\nN-V centers [3].\nTo conclude, we have proposed a scheme to deterministically entangle a string of N-V centers by strongly\ncoupling to the quantized motion of a nano-mechanical\ncantilever. Due to the long relaxation and dephasing\ntime of the electron spins in N-V centers together with\nthe weak intrinsic heating effects of the cantilever, our\npresent scheme would enable a promising way for future\nN-V-center-based QIP.\nThe work is supported by NNSFC under Grant No.\n10774042, by CAS, and by NFRPC.\n\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n\nJ.
