INTRODUCTION\n\nN (s, t) = 1 \u2212 L\u03b1\n\nThe continuous time random walk (CTRW), introduced by Montroll and Weiss [1,2], describes different\ntypes of diffusion processes including the standard Gaussian diffusion, sub diffusion [2\u20135] and L\u00e9vy walks [6\u201312].\nThe CTRW has been a useful tool in many diverse fields\nand over the last three decades e.g., it was used to describe transport in disorder medium [4,13,14] and in low\ndimensional chaotic systems [8,15\u201317]. More recently\nfractional kinetic equations were investigated as a tool describing phenomenologically anomalous diffusion [18\u201324].\nIn these equations fractional derivatives [25] replace ordinary integer derivatives in the standard integer kinetic\nequation. It is believed that fractional calculus can be\nused to model non integer diffusion phenomena. Schneider and Wyss have formulated the fractional diffusion\nequation (see Sec. III) [26] and under certain conditions [27\u201329] the fractional diffusion equation describes\nthe asymptotic large time behavior of the decoupled subdiffusive CTRW (with hr2 i \u223c t\u03b4 ; \u03b4 < 1). Thus some\nwhat like ordinary random walks which can be described\nasymptoticly by the diffusion equation, so can the CTRW\nbe described by fractional diffusion equation.\nRecently, Metzler, Barkai and Klafter [30] have investigated fractional Fokker\u2013Planck equation (FFPE) to describe an anomalous sub-diffusion motion in an external\nnon\u2013linear force field. In the absence of the external force\nfield the FFPE reduces to the fractional diffusion equa-\n\n\u0012\n\nt\ns1/\u03b1\n\n\u0013\n\n(2)\n\ndenotes the \"inverse\" one sided L\u00e9vy stable distribution\n(i.e., L\u03b1 (x) is the one sided L\u00e9vy stable distribution).\nFor example consider the force free case. The solution of\nthe FFPE P\u03b1 (r, t), with initial conditions concentrated\non the origin, is found by transforming P1 (r, s) and the\ntransformed function is the well known Gaussian solution of the integer diffusion equation with initial conditions concentrated on the origin. The transformation\nEq. (1) besides its practical value for finding solutions of\nthe FFPE also explains its meaning and relation to the\nCTRW (see details below).\nWe list previous work on the integral transformation\nEq. (1)\n1 Bouchaud and Georges [5] for the asymptotic long time\nlimit of the CTRW, then P1 (r, s) is Gaussian,\n2 Zumofen and Klafter [31] for CTRW on a lattice, then\nP1 (r, s) is solution of an ordinary random walk on a lattice,\n3 Saichev and Zaslavsky [32] for one dimensional solution\nof fractional diffusion equation, they have also considered\nan extension which includes L\u00e9vy flights,\n4 Barkai and Silbey [33] for the fractional OrnsteinUhlenbeck process.\nWe generalize these results for the dynamics described\nby the FFPE, and investigate in greater detail Eq. (1) in\nthe context of CTRW and fractional diffusion equation\nin dimensions d = 1, 2, 3.\n1\n\n\fThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. (II) we\nfollow [5] and derive the transformation Eq. (1) based\non the CTRW. We find an exact solution to the CTRW\nvalid for short and long times and compare this solution\nwith the result obtained from Eq. (1). In Sec. (III) we\nconsider the fractional diffusion equation. We investigate\nits integral solution Eq. (1) as well as the Fox function\nsolution found in [26]. In Sec. (IV) we show how to\nobtain solutions of the FFPE using Eq. (1). We give\nas examples the motion of a particle in a uniform and\nharmonic force fields. In Sec. (V) a brief summary is\ngiven.\n\nis the Laplace transform of P (r, t).\nW (r, s) will generally depend on f (r), however we are\ninterested only in the large time behavior of P (r, t) meaning that only contributions from large s are important.\nFrom standard central limit theorem we know\n\u0012 2\u0013\nr\n1\nexp\n\u2212\n. (6)\nW (r, s) \u2192s\u2192\u221e G (r, s) =\nd/2\n4s\n(4\u03c0s)\nWe have used the assumption that the system is unbiased and use convenient units. For most systems and for\nlarge times\nR \u221e NCT (s, t) is concentrated on s = t/\u03c4av and\n\u03c4av = 0 t\u03c8(t)dt is the averaged pausing time. In this\ncase P (r, t) will become Gaussian when t \u2192 \u221e. When\nNCT (s, t) is broad a non-Gaussian behavior is found.\nThis is the case when \u03c4av = \u221e or in other words when\nthe Laplace transform of \u03c8(t); \u03c8(u) behaves as\n\nII. CONTINUOUS TIME RANDOM WALK\n\nIn the decoupled version of the continuous time random walk (CTRW), a random walker hops from site to\nsite and at each site it is trapped for a random time [2].\nFor this well known model two independent probability\ndensities describe the random walk. The first is \u03c8(t), the\nprobability density function (PDF) of the independent\nidentically distributed (IID) pausing times between successive steps. The second is the PDF f (r) for the IID\ndisplacements of the random walker at each step. Thus\nthe CTRW describes a process for which the particle is\ntrapped on the origin for time \u03c41 , it then jumps to r1 , it\nis trapped on r1 for time \u03c42 and then it jumps to a new\nlocation, the process is then renewed. In what follows\nwe assume f (r) has a finite variance and a zero mean.\nThe asymptotic behavior of the decoupled CTRW is well\ninvestigated [2,3,31,34\u201336] and we now summarize some\nresults from the CTRW literature which are of relevance\nto our work.\nLet P (r, t) be the PDF of finding the CTRW particle\nat r at time t. Let NCT (s, t) be the probability that s\nsteps are made in the time interval (0, t) so clearly\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03c8 (u) \u223c 1 \u2212 u\u03b1 + * * * 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 1,\n\nand we have used convenient units. Shlesinger [3] showed\nthat in this case an anomalous sub-diffusive behavior is\nfound, hr2 i \u223c t\u03b1 . Because the steps are independent and\nbased on convolution theorem of Laplace transform\nNCT (s, u) =\n1 \u2212 \u03c8 (u)\nexp {s ln [\u03c8 (u)]} \u223c\nu\nu\u03b1\u22121 exp (\u2212su\u03b1 ) ,\n\n0\n\nand according to Eq. (8)\nNCT (s, t) = 1\n\n(3)\n\nn(s, u) \u2261 u\u03b1\u22121 exp (\u2212su\u03b1 ) .\n\nand the subscript CT denoted the CTRW. Because the\nmodel is decoupled\n\u221e\nX\n\nNCT (s, t)W (r, s) ,\n\nUsing the inverse Laplace transform we find\nZ \u221e\nP (r, t) \u223c\nn(s, t)G (r, s) ds\n\nNCT (s, u)W (r, s) ,\n\n(11)\n\nand n(s, t) is the inverse Laplace transform of n(s, u)\n[5,32,33]\n\u0012\n\u0013\nt\nt\n1\nl\u03b1\n(12)\nn(s, t) =\n\u03b1 s1+1/\u03b1\ns1/\u03b1\n\nand W (r, s) is the probability density that a particle has\nreached r after s steps. In what follows we shall use the\nFourier (r \u2192 k) and Laplace (t \u2192 u) transforms, we use\nthe convention that the argument of a function indicates\nin which space the function is defined, e.g.,\n\u221e\nX\n\n(10)\n\n0\n\n(4)\n\ns=0\n\nP (r, u) =\n\n(8)\n\nand NCT (s, u) is the Laplace transform of NCT (s, t).\nFollowing [5] we replace the summation in Eq. (5) with\nintegration and use Eq. (6) to find\nZ \u221e\nP (r, u) \u223c\nn(s, u)G(r, s)ds\n(9)\n\ns=0\n\nP (r, t) =\n\n(7)\n\nl\u03b1 (z) in Eq. (12) is a one sided L\u00e9vy stable probability\ndensity whose Laplace transform is\nZ \u221e\n\u03b1\nl\u03b1 (u) =\ne\u2212ux l\u03b1 (x) dx = e\u2212u .\n(13)\n\n(5)\n\ns=0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n\fAccording to Eq. (11) the large time behavior of the\nCTRW solution is reached using an integral transformation of the Gaussian solution of ordinary diffusion processes [i.e., of G(r, s)]. As we shall see similar transformations can be used to solve the FFPE and in particular\nthe fractional diffusion equation.\nThe kernel n (s, t) is a non negative PDF normalized\naccording to\nZ \u221e\nn (s, t) ds = 1,\n(14)\n\nA. CTRW Solution\n\nLet us consider an example of the (decoupled) CTRW\nprocess. The solution of the CTRW in k, u space is [2]\nP (k, u) =\n\n(17)\n\nUsually CTRW solutions are found based on numerical\ninverse Fourier\u2013Laplace transform of Eq. (17). Here we\nfind an exact solution of the CTRW process for a special choice of f (r) and \u03c8(t). Our solution is an infinite\nsum of well known functions. We assume the PDF of\njump times \u03c8(t) to be one sided L\u00e9vy stable density with\n\u03c8(u) = exp(\u2212u\u03b1 ) [40]. Displacements are assumed to be\nGaussian and then\n\u0012 2\u0013\nr\n1\nexp \u2212\n.\n(18)\nW (r, s) =\nd/2\n4s\n(4\u03c0s)\n\n0\n\nit replaces the CTRW probability NCT (s, t). Notice that\nthe PDF n (s, t), like NCT (s, t), is independent of the dimensionality of the problem d. Some properties of n(s, t)\nare given in [32]. All moments of n(s, t) are finite and\nare given later in Eq. (87). It is easy to show that\nn(s, t) = [dN (s, t)/ds] with N (s, t) defined in Eq. (2).\nn(s, t) is called the \"inverse\" one sided L\u00e9vy stable probability density [37].\nWhen \u03b1 = 1, we find n(s, t) = \u03b4(s\u2212t) and hence P (r, t)\nis Gaussian. This is expected since when \u03b1 = 1 the first\nmoment of pausing times \u03c4av is finite, therefore the law\nof large numbers is valid, and hence we expect that the\nnumber of steps s in the random walk scheme will follow\ns \u223c t/\u03c4av . When \u03b1 < 1 the law of large numbers is\nnot valid and instead the random number of steps s is\ndescribed by n(s, t). Thus the transformation, Eq. (11),\nhas a meaning of a generalized law of large numbers.\nEq. (12) gives the kernel n(s, t) in terms of a one sided\nL\u00e9vy stable density. Schneider [39] has expressed L\u00e9vy\nstable densities in terms of a Fox H function [41,42]\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n(\u22121, 1)\n1,0\n\u22121\n.\n(15)\nz\n|\nH\nl\u03b1 (z) =\n(\u22121/\u03b1, 1/\u03b1)\n\u03b1z 2 1,1\n\nis exact, not only asymptotic.

For the\ncases \u03b1 = 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, closed form equations in terms of\nknown functions, may be found in [39] (notice that [39]\npoints out relevant errors in the literature on L\u00e9vy stable\ndensities).\nImportant for our purposes is the result obtained by\nTunaley [34] already in 1974 which expressed the asymptotic behavior of the CTRW solution P (r, t), in terms of\nits Fourier\u2013Laplace transform, as shown in [34]\nu\u03b1\u22121\n.\nP (k, u) \u223c \u03b1\nu + k2\n\n1\n1 \u2212 \u03c8(u)\n.\nu\n1 \u2212 \u03c8(u)f (k)\n\nis the one sided L\u00e9vy stable distribution.

We show r 3 P (r, t) versus \u03be = r 2 /t\u03b1 for the CTRW\nprocess and for \u03b1 = 1/2, d = 3. The curves in the figure, t = 2\n(dot dashed), t = 20 (dotted), t = 200 (dashed) and t = 2000\n(stars) are converging in the limit t \u2192 \u221e to the asymptotic\nmaster curve (solid). This master curve was computed numerically based on Eq. (11). It is difficult to distinguish between\nthe results for t = 200, 2000 and the asymptotic result. Not\nshown is the delta function contribution at r = 0.\n\nThe Fourier\u2013Laplace solution of the fractional diffusion\nequation, with initial conditions P (r, t = 0) = \u03b4(r),\n\nLet us calculate the Cartesian moments\n\nP (k, u) =\n\nM (2m1 , * * * , 2md ) =\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndx1 * * *\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThus solution Eq. (11) which was only asymptotic in the\nCTRW framework is exact within the fractional diffusion\nequation approach. The integral solution Eq. (31) for\nd = 1 was investigated by Saichev and Zaslavsky, we\ninvestigate also the cases d = 2, 3 which exhibit behaviors\ndifferent than the one dimensional case.\nAs mentioned, Schneider and Wyss [26] have inverted\nEq. (30) finding the solution to the fractional diffusion\nequation in terms of rather formal Fox function. Later\nwe shall show that moments of P (r, t) calculated based\non the integral solution Eq. (31) in dimensions d = 1, 2, 3\nare identical to the moments calculated based upon the\nFox function solution. In this sense we show that the two\nsolutions are identical.\nAt this stage we have only shown that the two approaches, asymptotic CTRW and fractional diffusion\n\n(25)\n\nwith\nCm,d\n\n(30)\n\n0\n\nwith non negative integers m1 , m2 , * * *.

Therefore\nthe integral solution of fractional diffusion equation is\nZ \u221e\nP (r, t) =\nn(s, t)G (r, s) ds.\n(31)\n\n1\nd\ndxd x2m\n* * * x2m\nP (x1 , * * * , xd , t) (24)\n1\nd\n\nM (2m1 , * * * , 2md ) =\n#)\n\"\n( \u0014\n\u0015\n\u221e\nX\nt\nt\nsm\nL\u03b1 1/\u03b1 \u2212 L\u03b1\nCm,d\n1/\u03b1\ns\n(s\n+\n1)\ns=1\n\n(28)\n\n(26)\n\nPd\nand m = i mi > 0. In the Appendix we also show that\nfor t \u2192 \u221e\nM (2m1 , * * * , 2md ) \u223c\n4\n\n\fequation are identical. The reader might be wondering\nwhy should we bother with the fractional equation if the\nCTRW approach gives identical results. The situation\nis some what similar to the standard diffusion equation\nwhich predicts a Gaussian evolution. The diffusion equation \u03b1 = 1 is an asymptotic equation describing much\nmore general random walks. The main advantage of the\ndiffusion equation over a random walk approach is its\nsimplicity. Solutions with special boundary conditions\n(reflecting/absorbing) are relatively simple and usually\ncapture the essence of the more complex random walks.\nAnother extension of the diffusion equation is the diffusion in external field as described by Fokker\u2013Planck equations, such an extension for random walks is cumbersome.\nThe same is true for the fractional diffusion equation. It\ncan serve as a phenomenological tool describing anomalous diffusion. As we shall show in the next section we\ncan include the effects of an external field. On the other\nhand CTRW by definition is not built to consider an external field.\n\nn\n\nhr (t)i = \u03a9d\n\n2n \u0393 (1 + n/2) \u03b1n/2\nt\n.\n\u0393 (1 + \u03b1n/2)\n\nhr2 (t)i =\n\n\u0001\n\n(35)\n\n2dt\u03b1\n.\n\u0393 (1 + \u03b1)\n\n(36)\n\nWhen \u03b1 = 1 the moments in Eq. (35) are identical to\nthe Gaussian moments in Eq. (33).\nIn Appendix C we calculate the Cartesian moments\ndefined in Eq. (24). We find\nM (2m1 , * * * , 2md ) = Cm,d\n\n\u0393 (1 + m) \u03b1m\nt\n\u0393 (1 + \u03b1m)\n\n(37)\n\nwhich is identical to the right hand side of equation (27).\nThus the moments of the integral solution of fractional\ndiffusion equation are identical to the asymptotic behavior of the moments of the CTRW found in the previous\nsection.\nEq. (37) was also found in [26] based on Fox function\nsolution of fractional diffusion equation (see details next\nsubsection). Since the integral solution Eq. (31) gives\nidentical moments to those found using the Fox function\nsolution one can assume that the two solutions are identical. It would be interesting to show in a more direct way\nthat the Fox function solution is identical to the integral\nsolution. In Appendix D we use a theorem on Fox functions and attempt to give such a proof. Unfortunately\nwe fail. The interested reader is referred to Appendix D.\n\nWe first notice that the integral solution Eq. (31)\nshows that P (r, t) is normalized and non-negative. The\nnormalization is easily seen with the help of Eq. (14)\nand the non negativity of P (r, t) is evident because both\nn(s, t) and G(r, s) are non negative.\nCalculation of spherical moments hrn (t)i is now considered. The calculation follows two steps, the first is to\ncalculate hrn (s)i for Gaussian diffusion (or find the Gaussian moments in a text book) then using the transformation defined in Eq. (31) we find the moments hrn (t)i for\nthe fractional case. More precisely in Laplace u space\n\u0014Z\n\u0015\nZ \u221e\nhrn (u)i =\ndsn(s, u)\nG (r, s) rn dr ,\n(32)\n\nB.

(44-46) were derived independently by A. I. Saichev\n[45].\nThe CTRW behavior on the origin is different than\nwhat we have found for the fractional diffusion equation\nEqs. (44-46). Within the CTRW on the decay on the\norigin is described with the first term on the right hand\nside of Eq. (22), [1 \u2212 L\u03b1 (t)] \u03b4 (r). This term describes\nrandom walks for which the particle is trapped on its\ninitial location during the time of observation t. This\nCTRW term decays like t\u2212\u03b1 \u03b4 (r) for long times and no\nsuch singular term is found in the solution of the fractional. In dimensions d = 2, 3 the decay of the CTRW\nsingular term is as slow as the decay of P (0, t) found\nfrom the fractional diffusion equation. Hence on the origin the fractional diffusion approximation does not work\nwell. In contrast, for normal random walks, the singular term decays exponentially with time and then the\ndiffusion approximation works well already after an exponentially short time.\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\nP(r)\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22125\n\n10\n\n\u22126\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\nr\n\nFIG. 2.

We consider\nthe one dimensional case and extensions to higher dimensions are straight forward. When F (x) = 0 the FFPE\nEq. (50) reduces to the fractional diffusion equation (28).\nWhen \u03b1 = 1 we recover the ordinary Fokker-Planck equation. The stationary solution of the FFPE is the Boltzmann distribution and the equation is compatible with\nlinear response theory [30].\nIn this section we find an integral solution of the FFPE.\nWe show that the solution is normalized and non negative, an issue not discussed in [30]. Without loss of\ngenerality we set K\u03b1 = 1. We consider initial condition\nP (x, t = 0) = \u03b4(x \u2212 x0 ).\nFirst let us show that the solution is normalized. Integrating Eq. (50) with respect to x and using the boundary conditions\n\nFinally in Fig. 4 we show our results in a scaling form,\nsimilar to the way we presented the CTRW results in\nFig. 1 which shows the CTRW solution for both short\nand long times. We present r3 P (r, t) versus \u03be for different\nchoices of time t. We observe collapse of all curves, both\nfor shorter and longer times, onto one master curve. We\nalso show the asymptotic behaviors \u03be >> 1 and \u03be <<\n1, Eq. (39) and Eq. (43) respectively. The numerical\nintegral solution Eq. (31) agrees well with the asymptotic\nbehaviors in the appropriate regimes. Comparing Fig.\n(1) and Fig. (4) we see that the solution of the fractional\ndiffusion equation approximates the exact solution of the\nCTRW very well when t \u2192 \u221e and r 6= 0.\n0.05\n\n0.045\n\n0.04\n\n0.035\n\nP (x, t)|x=\u00b1\u221e =\n\n0.03\n\n\u2202P (x, t)\n|x=\u00b1\u221e = 0\n\u2202x\n\n(52)\n\nwe find\n\n0.025\n\n3\n\nr P(r,t)\n\n(50)\n\nZ\n\n0.02\n\n\u1e56 (x, t)dx = 0,\n\n(53)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n0.015\n\nmeaning that normalization is conserved as it should.\nWe write the solution of the FFPE Eq.

(10).\nWe see that the integral solution of the FFPE has a\nsimilar structure as the solutions of the fractional diffusion equation or equivalently of the asymptotic CTRW.\nThe solution is Eq. (54) with n(s, t) defined in Eq. (12)\nand P1 (x, s) being the solution of corresponding ordinary\nFokker-Planck equation. It is easy to understand that the\nsolution, P (x, t) is normalized and non negative because\nboth P1 (x, t) and n(s, t) are normalized PDFs.\nIn [30] a different method of solution of the fractional\nFokker\u2013Planck equation was investigated. It can be\nshown that P (x, t) can be expanded in an eigen function\nexpansion, which is similar to the standard eigen function\nexpansion of solution of ordinary Fokker\u2013Planck equation, however eigen modes decay according to Mittag\u2013\nLeffler relaxation instead of the standard exponential decay of the modes in the integer Fokker\u2013Planck equation.\nIt can be shown that the integral solution investigated\nhere is identical to the eigen function expansion in [30].\n\n(55)\n\nP1 (x, s) is a normalized solution of the ordinary FokkerPlanck equation with initial conditions P1 (x, s = 0) =\n\u03b4(x \u2212 x0 ). Methods of solution of Eq. (55) are given in\nRisken's book [47]. In what follows we shall prove that\n\u00f1(s, t) = n(s, t), defined in Eq. (12).\nWe use the Laplace transform of Eq.

(54) using Eqs. (47)\nand (73). Our results are presented in Fig. 6. We have\nconsidered an initial condition x0 = 1/2 and we observe\na strong dependence of the solution on the initial condition. A cusp on x = x0 is observed for all times t,\nthus the initial condition has a strong influence on the\nsolution. The solution approaches the stationary Gaussian shape slowly in a power law way and the solution\ndeviates from Gaussian for any finite time. Unlike the\nordinary Gaussian OU process, the maximum of P (x, t)\nis not on the average hx(t)i but rather the maximum is\nfor short times located on the initial condition.\n\nfor 0 < x. As seen in the figure the exact result exhibits a\nstrong sensitivity on initial condition and the maximum\nof P (x, t) is located on x = 0. This is different than ordinary diffusion process in which the maximum of P (x, t)\nis on hx(t)i. The curves in Fig. 5 are similar to those\nobserved by Scher and Montroll [4] based on lattice simulation of CTRW and also by Weissman et al [36] who\ninvestigated biased CTRW using an analytical approach.\nThe FFPE solution presented here is much simpler than\nthe CTRW solution, still it captures all the important\nfeatures of the more complex CTRW result.\n\n9\n\n\f1.4\n\n1.2\n\nP(x,t)\n\nt=0.02\n\nt=0.2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n\u22122\n\n0\nx\n\n2\n\n1.4\n\n0\n\nVI.

In a similar way the fractional OU describes an\nover damped and anomalous motion in Harmonic potential considered in this section and in [30], it can also be\nused to model the velocity of a particle exhibiting a L\u00e9vy\nwalk type of motion [33].
