Our limiting Frobenius structure\nis shown to be effectively computable in an appropriate sense for a degeneration of projective hypersurfaces. We conjecture that the limiting\nFrobenius structure relates to the rigid cohomology of a semistable limit\nof the degeneration through an analogue of the Clemens-Schmidt exact\nsequence. Our construction is illustrated, and conjecture supported, by a\nselection of explicit examples.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis paper grew out of the author's attempt to generalise an algorithm for\ncomputing zeta functions of smooth projective hypersurfaces over finite fields\nto the case of singular hypersurfaces. This existing algorithm is called the\ndeformation method, as the geometric idea behind the method is to deform a\nsmooth diagonal hypersurface to the hypersurface in which one is interested. In\nthis paper we degenerate smooth projective hypersurfaces to singular projective\nhypersurfaces, possibly not even reduced or irreducible, and try to compute\nsome p-adic cohomological data attached to the degeneration. The problem\nwe address is, how does one compute this cohomological data and what is its\ngeometric meaning? Let us begin by sketching the original deformation method\nfor smooth projective hypersurfaces [7, 19].\nLet Fq be the finite field with q elements of characteristic p, and\nP0 \u2208 Fq [x0 , x1 , * * * , xn+1 ]\nbe a homogeneous polynomial of degree d defining a smooth hypersurface X0\n\n1\n\n\fin Pn+1\nFq . Recall that the zeta function of X0 is the formal power series\nZ(X0 , T ) := exp\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nk=1\n\nTk\n|X0 (Fqk )|\nk\n\n!\n\nwhich encodes the number of points on X0 over the different finite extensions\nFqk of the base field Fq . By a famous theorem of Dwork this series is the local\nexpansion at the origin of a rational function with integer coefficients [4]. Define\nP1 := xd0 + xd1 + * * * + xdn+1\nand assume p does not divide d, so that the projective hypersurface X1 defined\n1\nby P1 is smooth. Let X \u2282 Pn+1\nFq \u00d7AFq be the subvariety of smooth hypersurfaces\nin the pencil defined by the equation\nPt := (1 \u2212 t)P0 + tP1 = 0.\nThus there is an open curve S \u2286 A1Fq and a smooth morphism X \u2192 S with\ngeneric fibre the smooth hypersurface defined by Pt . One can construct to any\np-adic precision (in a well-defined sense) the relative rigid cohomology H :=\nn\nHrig\n(X/S) of the smooth projective family by starting with the cohomology\nn\nHrig\n(X1 ) of the smooth diagonal fibre and solving a p-adic differential equation.\nSince X0 is also smooth a base change theorem allows one to specialise H to an\nn\nobject H0 such that H0 = Hrig\n(X0 ). Let K be the unique unramified extension\nof the field of p-adic numbers Qp with residue field Fq , and \u03c3 : K \u2192 K the\nFrobenius automorphism. We shall not say anything in detail here about rigid\nn\ncohomology, except that Hrig\n(X0 ) is a vector space of finite dimension over K\nwhich is acted upon by a \u03c3-linear map F0 called Frobenius. The trace formula\nin rigid cohomology\nlog (q)\n\nn+1\n\nn\ndet(1 \u2212 T F0 p |Hrig\n(X0 ))(\u22121)\nZ(X0 , T ) =\n(1 \u2212 T )(1 \u2212 qT )(1 \u2212 q 2 T ) * * * (1 \u2212 q n T )\n\n(1)\n\nnow allows us to recover the zeta function exactly, assuming we have carried\nenough p-adic precision in our computation.\nWhen X0 is singular the above algorithm fails, both in theory and practice.\nm\nOne cannot specialise H = Hrig\n(X/S) at the point t = 0 given the manner in\nwhich it is constructed in our original method, and even if one could there is no\nbase change theorem to tell you what this gives.\nIn this paper we consider the case in which X0 is (almost) any projective\nhypersurface, perhaps singular or reducible, or even not reduced as a scheme.\nIn fact we work in slightly greater generality than above, but subject to one\nlifting condition. We consider a smooth family X \u2192 S \u2286 A1Fq of projective\nhypersurfaces of degree d and dimension n which lifts to a smooth family XOL \u2192\nSOL of projective hypersurfaces of degree d over the ring of integers OL of an\nalgebraic number field L \u2282 K such that all fibres in the punctured p-adic open\n2\n\n\funit disk around the origin are \"smooth and in general position\" (Definition\n2.7). It is convenient to further assume that 1 \u2208 S. We say then that X \u2192 S\nis in general position and has a good algebraic lift around t = 0 (Definition\nn\n3.14). Defining as before H := Hrig\n(X/S), we now introduce a new object\n(H0 , N0 , F0 , e) which we call the limiting (mixed) Frobenius structure at t = 0. It\nis a finite dimensional vector space H0 over the p-adic field K with an invertible\n\u03c3-linear operator F0 : H0 \u2192 H0 and nilpotent operator N0 : H0 \u2192 H0 with\nN0n+1 = 0 such that\nN0 F0 = pF0 N0 ;\nand in addition a positive integer e. We call F0 the Frobenius operator and N0\nthe monodromy operator. The integer e specifies a cover Se \u2192 S (t 7\u2192 te ) of\nthe base curve which occurs during the construction. The monodromy operator\nN0 is defined over the algebraic number field L \u2282 K and so we may represent\nit explicitly via a nilpotent matrix of algebraic numbers with respect to some\nbasis of H0 . With respect to the same basis, the matrix for the Frobenius F0\nhas entries in the uncountable field K and one cannot write it down; however,\nfor each positive integer N one may approximate it by a matrix F\u03030 with entries\nin the algebraic number field L such that ordp (F0 \u2212 F\u03030 ) \u2265 N . We call such a\nF\u03030 a pN -approximation to the matrix for F0 . Our main theoretical result is as\nfollows (Theorem 3.15).\nTheorem 1.1. The limiting Frobenius structure (H0 , N0 , F0 , e) at t = 0 for\na degeneration of smooth projective hypersurfaces X \u2192 S which has a good\nalgebraic lift around t = 0 and is in general position is effectively computable,\nin the following sense. Given such a degeneration and any positive integer N ,\none may compute e, a basis for H0 , and with respect to this basis the matrix for\nN0 and a pN -approximation to a matrix for F0 .\nOur algorithm for computing the limiting Frobenius structure is deterministic and explicit. It is practical in two senses. First, one may show that it is\npolynomial-time in p, logp (q), (d+1)n and N under favourable assumptions (Section 3.3.2). Second, the author has implemented the algorithm in the programming language Magma, and executed it for degenerations of curves, surfaces\nand threefolds of various different degrees (Section 5).\nGiven that one can define and compute the limiting Frobenius structure,\nit is natural to next ask for its geometric significance. When 0 \u2208 S then the\nfibre X0 in X \u2192 S is smooth. In this case e = 1, N0 = 0 and F0 is the usual\nn\nFrobenius map on H0 = Hrig\n(X0 ). Let us suppose then that 0 6\u2208 S and so X0\nis not defined. One may canonically extend X \u2192 S to a flat family Y \u2192 T of\nprojective hypersurfaces over T := S \u222a {0}. Let us denote the fibre over the\norigin in Y \u2192 T as X0 and call it the degenerate fibre. One sees from some\nexamples (Examples 5.2, 5.3, 5.8 and 5.13) that there may be no relationship\nbetween the limiting Frobenius structure and the zeta function of X0 . Before\nproceeding further we need some more definitions.\nLet us denote by Se \u2192 S and Te \u2192 T the covers defined by the map t 7\u2192 te ,\nand write Xe := X \u00d7S Se . (We suspect that it is a consequence of our lifting\n3\n\n\fhypothesis that the integer e is always coprime to p (Note 3.9), and so the cover\nSe \u2192 S is unramified.) Note that Xe \u2192 Se is still a smooth family of projective\nhypersurfaces. We shall say that Xe \u2192 Se extends to a semistable degeneration\nover the origin if the following is true. There exists a smooth Fq -variety Ye\nand flat morphism Ye \u2192 Te which restricts over Se \u2282 Te to Xe \u2192 Se with the\nfibre Ye,0 over 0 \u2208 T a reduced union of smooth hypersurfaces on Ye crossing\ntransversally. When Xe \u2192 Se extends to a semistable degeneration Ye \u2192 Te\nover the origin, we shall sometimes denote the degenerate fibre Ye,0 by Xe,0 ,\nbearing in mind always that it depends upon the choice of extension. We make\nthe following conjecture, motivated in part by an analogy with degenerations\nof complex algebraic varieties (Theorem 4.3). (See Conjecture 4.11 for a fuller\nstatement of our conjecture.)\nConjecture 1.2. The morphism Xe \u2192 Se extends to a semistable degeneration\nover the origin with degenerate fibre Xe,0 . Moreover, for any such extension\nthere exists a \"Clemens-Schmidt\" exact sequence in rigid cohomology containing\nthe following\nN\nn\n(Xe,0 ) \u2192 H0 \u21920 H0 (\u22121) \u2192 * * * .\n* * * \u2192 Hrig\nThe exactness of the above three term sequence in the middle (\"local invarilog (q)\n\nant cycle theorem\") implies that det(1 \u2212 T F0 p |Ker(N0 )) occurs as a factor\nin the \"middle Weil polynomial\" of the zeta function of the semistable variety\nXe,0 . The main experimental work in this paper is the testing of our conjecture\nfor some degenerations of low dimensional hypersurfaces (Section 5).\nHaving shown that the limiting Frobenius structure for a degeneration of\nhypersurfaces under a lifting assumption is effectively computable, and provided\nsome experimental evidence supporting a conjectural geometric interpretation\nof this structure, next one might ask if all this is of any use. Let us call the\nalgorithm in this paper the degeneration method. The author suggests at least\ntwo practical applications of this method.\nWhen the morphism Y \u2192 T canonically extending X \u2192 S over the origin\nis semistable, under Conjecture 4.11 the degeneration method computes cohomological information about X0 itself. In particular the algorithm can (conjecturally) be used to compute the zeta function of a nodal plane projective curve,\nby embedding it as the degenerate fibre in a suitable family. It is a classical\nfact that any irreducible projective curve over an algebraically closed field is\nbirational to a plane projective curve with only nodes as singularities [15, Theorem 1.61], and this transformation is effective. Thus given any geometrically\nirreducible projective curve over Fq one can explicitly find a semistable plane\nmodel over an extension of Fq , and use the degeneration method to compute\nthe zeta function of this plane model; see Example 5.7.\nFor a second application of the degeneration method, recall that irreducible\nplane curves with a single node arise naturally when one is interested in calculating the L-series of a smooth plane curve defined over the integers. The\ncohomology of these curves gives the factors at the bad primes. The degeneration method will compute these factors, under Conjecture 4.11; see Note 5.6 for\n4\n\n\fan example.\nWe make two concluding remarks. First, the existence of a suitably-defined\nlimiting Frobenius structure at t = 0 for any smooth projective family X \u2192 S \u2282\nA1Fq \\{0} of varieties actually follows from the semistable reduction theorem of\nKedlaya for overconvergent F -isocrystals on an open curve [12]; indeed, directly\nfrom its local incarnation the p-adic local monodromy theorem. We have just\ngiven an independent and effective proof of its existence for the case of hypersurfaces subject to a lifting assumption, and given the object a name; see Note\n3.17 for a discussion of nomenclature. (In fact, we show its existence for any\nsmooth proper family X \u2192 S subject to a lifting assumption (Definition 3.10\nand Theorem 3.8). But without the lifting assumption the situation is much\nmore difficult, and one needs to allow different covers of S than just t 7\u2192 te .)\nKedlaya's semistable reduction theorem motivated the author to try to adapt\nthe deformation method to handle degenerations.\nSecond, there is a close analogy with the theory of degenerations of smooth\ncomplex algebraic varieties where one has a limiting mixed Hodge structure [28,\nChapter 11]. However, our situation is even richer. Section 3.4 sketches the\nconstruction of a limiting (mixed) Frobenius-Hodge structure at t = 0 in dimension m attached to a smooth and proper morphism XOL \u2192 SOL \u2282 A1SO and a\nL\nsuitably large rational prime p inert in the ring of integers OL of a number field\nL. This object is new to the author. It is a quadruple (H0\u2022 , N0 , F, e)W consisting\nof a filtered W -module H0\u2022 with operators N0 and F0 such that N0 F0 = pF0 N0 ,\nN0m+1 = 0 and F0 H0i \u2286 pi H0 , along with a positive integer e. (Here W is the\nring of integers of the p-adic field K.) When e = 1, the pair \"(H0\u2022 , N0 )W \u2297W C\" is\nthe usual limiting mixed Hodge structure at t = 0 of the degeneration of complex\nalgebraic varieties, and a similar triple to (H0 , N0 , F0 )W occurs in crystalline\ncohomology (Hyodo-Kato cohomology in mixed characteristic). This structure\nis computable in an appropriate sense for a degeneration of hypersurfaces and\nsuitably large prime p. One can then extend Conjecture 4.11 by insisting everything is defined over W and there is an exact sequence of \"Frobenius-Hodge\nstructures\". The existence of this W -lattice structure and Hodge filtration on\nthe limiting Frobenius structures informed the author's choice of precisions in\nthe computations in Section 5.\nThe paper is organised in the following manner. Section 2 considers the\nalgebraic de Rham cohomology of degenerations of varieties over a computable\nfield of characteristic zero. The first main result is some kind of partly \"effective\"\nsemistable reduction theorem in algebraic de Rham cohomology (Theorem 2.4).\nWe then focus on degenerations of projective hypersurfaces and give an entirely\neffective proof of semistable reduction for algebraic de Rham cohomology in\nthis situation (Theorem 2.15). Section 3 considers degenerations in positive\ncharacteristic and introduces limiting Frobenius structures. After showing the\nnotion is well-defined (Section 3.2.2) we use Theorem 2.4 to show that they\nexist under a lifting assumption (Theorem 3.8 and Definition 3.10). We then\napply the theory of Section 2.3 to show that limiting Frobenius structures are\neffectively computable in an appropriate sense for degenerations of hypersurfaces\n\n5\n\n\fsubject to a lifting assumption (Definition 3.14 and Theorem 3.15). Next follows\na brief sketch of how one endows our limiting Frobenius structures with an\nintegral structure and Hodge filtration (Section 3.4). Section 4 presents our\nconjectural \"Clemens-Schmidt\" exact sequence in rigid cohomology (Conjecture\n4.11). Finally, in Section 5 we present an assortment of examples computed by\nthe author which give some support to Conjecture 4.11 and also illustrate our\nconstructions. Although the remaining sections are arranged in their logical\norder, we recommend that the reader begins by looking through Section 5 and\nthen gently reverses through the paper before starting in earnest.\n\n2\n\nDegenerations in characteristic zero\n\nLet F be a field of characteristic zero. We wish to be able to compute with\nelements of F , so let us assume that F is countable and one can effectively\nperform arithmetic operations in F .\n\n2.1\n\nRelative algebraic de Rham cohomology\n\nWe refer to [11] for the definition of relative algebraic de Rham cohomology and\nthe Gauss-Manin connection.\nLet S \u2286 A1F be an open curve, and X \u2192 S be a smooth morphism of algebraic varieties over F of relative dimension n. Fix an integer m with 0 \u2264 m \u2264 2n\nm\nand denote by HdR\n(X/S) the mth relative algebraic de Rham cohomology group\nof X \u2192 S.\nWrite S = Spec(A) where A = F [t, 1/\u2206(t)] for some polynomial \u2206(t) \u2208 F [t].\nm\nThen HdR\n(X/S) is a locally free A-module of finite rank, which we may assume\nto be free since A is a principal ideal domain (see for example [18, Chapter\nIII.7]). Let\nid\u2297\n\n\u2207\n\nd\n\nGM\nm\nm\nm\n\u2207 d : HdR\n(X/S)\nHdR\n(X/S) \u2297 \u03a91A \u2192dt HdR\n(X/S) \u2192\ndt\n\nd\ndenote the Gauss-Manin connection \u2207GM contracted with dt\n\u2208 Hom(\u03a91A , A).\nTo ease notation we shall write \u2207 := \u2207 d and call this the Gauss-Manin condt\nnection. The connection \u2207 is Leibniz linear; that is,\n\n\u2207(r + s) = \u2207(r) + \u2207(s),\n\u2207(ar) =\n\nda\nr + a\u2207(r)\ndt\n\nm\nfor a \u2208 A and r, s \u2208 HdR\n(X/S).\n\n2.2\n\nRegularity and semistable reduction\n\nm\nLet r be the rank of HdR\n(X/S) and B be a basis. Denote by N (t) the matrix for\nthe Gauss-Manin connection acting on this basis. The matrix N (t) has entries\n\n6\n\n\fin A. If one changes basis by a matrix H \u2208 GLr (A), then since \u2207 is Leibniz\nlinear the new matrix for \u2207 w.r.t. the basis B[H] := {Hb}b\u2208B is\nN[H] := HN H \u22121 +\n\ndH \u22121\nH .\ndt\n\nSuppose that \u2206(0) = 0, so that N (t) may have a pole at t = 0. Then the\n\"regularity theorem\" guarantees that there exists a matrix H \u2208 GLr (F ((t)))\nsuch that N[H] has only a simple pole at t = 0, see for example [10]. We use\nthis theorem to prove a stronger and effective result.\nTheorem 2.1 (Regularity). There exists an explicit deterministic algorithm\nwith the following input and output. The input is the matrix N (t) for the Gaussm\nManin connection \u2207 on HdR\n(X/S) with respect to some basis B, where X \u2192 S\nis a smooth morphism of varieties over a computable field F . The output is a\nmatrix H \u2208 GLr (F [t, t\u22121 ]) such that the matrix N[H] for \u2207 w.r.t. the basis B[H]\nm\nof HdR\n(X/S) has only a simple pole at t = 0.\nProof. If \u2206(0) 6= 0 then we are done since the matrix N (t) will not have a pole\nm\nat t = 0. So assume \u2206(0) = 0. For \u03c9 \u2208 HdR\n(X/S), let B\u03c9 := {(t\u2207)i (\u03c9)}0\u2264i<r .\nm\nBy definition, \u03c9 is a cyclic vector for the differential system (HdR\n(X/S), (t\u2207))\nover F ((t)) if and only if B\u03c9 is a linearly independent set over F ((t)). For any\ngiven \u03c9 expressed in the basis B one may check whether \u03c9 is cyclic by computing\nd\n+ tN (t). Now a\na determinant since one can calculate the action of t\u2207 via t dt\ncyclic vector exists amongst a certain finite list of F [t]-linear combinations of the\nbasis B according to [29, Lemma 2.10]. Thus one may effectively find a cyclic\nvector, \u03c9 say. The differential system is regular, by the regularity theorem.\nThus by [14, Corollary 7.1.3], the matrix for the connection w.r.t. the basis B\u03c9\nm\nof HdR\n(X/S) \u2297A F ((t)) has only a simple pole at t = 0. We can compute the\nchange of basis matrix G between B and B\u03c9 , since we can explicitly compute\nthe action of (t\u2207)i on \u03c9. Note that G \u2208 GLr (F (t)). Embedding F (t) \u0592\u2192 F ((t))\nand using Lemma 2.2, we may factor G = LH where H \u2208 GLr (F [t, t\u22121 ]) and\nL \u2208 GLr (F [[t]]). Then N[H] has only a simple pole at t = 0, since N[H] =\n(N[G] )[L\u22121 ] with N[G] having a simple pole and L\u22121 no pole at t = 0. Moreover,\nm\nB[H] is a global basis for HdR\n(X/S) since H(t) \u2208 GLr (F [t, t\u22121 ]) \u2286 GLr (A).\nThus H is the desired change of basis matrix.\nLemma 2.2. Given any G \u2208 GLr (F ((t))) there exists H \u2208 GLr (F [t, t\u22121 ]) and\nL \u2208 GLr (F [[t]]) such that G = LH. Moreover, if G \u2208 GLr (F (t)) \u2282 GLr (F ((t)))\nthen such H and L \u2208 GLr (F [[t]] \u2229 F (t)) are effectively computable.\nProof. Let G \u2208 GLr (F ((t))). We prove by induction on r that there exists L \u2208\nGLr (F [[t]]) such that LG is upper triangular with monomials on the diagonal\nand elements in F [t, t\u22121 ] above the diagonal. The case r = 1 is immediate. For\nr > 1, by row operations (equivalently, premultiplying by a suitable matrix in\nGLr (F [[t]])) one may reduce to the case in which G is upper triangular with\nmonomials on the diagonal and elements in F ((t)) above the diagonal. Next, by\ninduction one may assume that all entries in G above the diagonal except those\n7\n\n\fon the first row lie in F [t, t\u22121 ]. Finally, by an explicit calculation one shows\nthat there exists a matrix L \u2208 GLr (F [[t]]) of the following form such that LG is\nas required: L equals the identity matrix except for elements in positions (1, i)\nfor 2 \u2264 i \u2264 r. Note that the factorisation is unique up to multiplication by an\nelement of GLr (F [t]). In the case in which G \u2208 GLr (F (t)) one checks that this\nproof describes an effective algorithm and L \u2208 GLr (F [[t]] \u2229 F (t)).\nNote 2.3 The use of a cyclic vector and the factorisation in Lemma 2.2 were\nsuggested to the author by Kiran Kedlaya. Kedlaya also suggests replacing the\nuse of a cyclic vector by a basis over F [[t]] for the (t\u2207)-stable lattice in F ((t))\ngenerated by the elements {(t\u2207)i (b)} for 0 \u2264 i < r and b \u2208 B. We further note\nthat one could use Katz's explicit construction of a cyclic vector [29, Lemma\n2.11]; see paragraph 2 in the proof of [14, Theorem 5.4.2] for how to get around\nthe assumption of Katz that one has an element \"z\" in F ((t)) with \"z \u2032 = 1\"\nd\n.\nwhere in our case the dash is the operator t dt\nThe significance of Theorem 2.1 is that using a change of basis matrix which\nis invertible over F [t, t\u22121 ] does not introduce any new poles in the matrix for the\nconnection. Thus when F is a countable subfield of the field of p-adic numbers\n(or the complex numbers), one does not change the radius of convergence on\nthe punctured disk around zero of the connection matrix. This is essential in\napplications of the theorem to p-adic cohomology (Section 3).\nWe now turn to the problem of semistable reduction. For e a positive integer,\nwrite Ae := F [s, 1/\u2206(se )] and Se := Spec(Ae ). Define A \u2192 Ae by t 7\u2192 se to get\na morphism Se \u2192 S. One may pull-back the family X \u2192 S via Se \u2192 S to get\nXe \u2192 Se where Xe := X \u00d7S Se . We have\nm\nm\n(Xe /Se ) \u223c\nHdR\n(X/S) \u2297A Ae\n= HdR\nm\nsince Ae is a flat A-module. For a basis B of HdR\n(X/S) let Be := {b \u2297 1Ae } be\nm\nthe associated basis of HdR (Xe /Se ). As before let N (t) be the matrix for the\nGauss-Manin connection w.r.t. the basis B. Then the matrix for the GaussManin connection\n\u2207\n\nGM\nm\nm\nHdR\n(Xe /Se ) \u2297 \u03a91Ae\n\u2207e : HdR\n(Xe /Se ) \u2192\n\nw.r.t. the basis Be is\n\nd\nid\u2297 ds\n\nm\n\u2192 HdR\n(Xe /Se )\n\n(ese\u22121 )N (se ),\n\nsince dt = ese\u22121 ds.\nThe problem of local semistable reduction in algebraic de Rham cohomology\nm\nis to find a positive integer e and basis for HdR\n(Xe /Se ) such that the matrix for\nthe connection \u2207 has only a simple pole at s = 0 with nilpotent residue matrix.\nTheorem 2.4 (Semistable reduction). There exists an explicit deterministic\nalgorithm with the following input and output. The input is the matrix N (t) for\nm\nthe Gauss-Manin connection on HdR\n(X/S) w.r.t. some basis B, where X \u2192 S\n8\n\n\fis a smooth morphism of varieties over a computable field F . The output is an\ninteger e and matrix H(s) \u2208 GLr (F [s, s\u22121 ]) such that the matrix\ndH \u22121\nH\nds\nm\nfor the Gauss-Manin connection \u2207e on the basis (Be )[H(s)] of HdR\n(Xe /Se ) has\nonly a simple pole at s = 0 with nilpotent residue matrix.\n(ese\u22121 N (se ))[H(s)] := Hese\u22121 N (se )H \u22121 +\n\nProof. By Theorem 2.1 one reduces to the case in which N (t) has only a simple\npole at t = 0. Let {\u03bbi }1\u2264i\u2264r denote the eigenvalues of the residue matrix. By\nthe local monodromy theorem we have \u03bbi \u2208 Q, see [10]. Thus we may find a\nsmallest positive integer e such that e\u03bbi \u2208 Z for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r. Then ese\u22121 N (se )\nhas only a simple pole at s = 0 and a residue matrix with integer eigenvalues.\nShearing transformations now allow one to find a matrix H(s) \u2208 GLr (F [s, s\u22121 ])\nsuch that (ese\u22121 N (se ))[H] has only a simple pole with nilpotent residue matrix\n[5, Lemma III.8.2]. (Note that since in our application the eigenvalues of the\nresidue matrix lie in Z, the initial reduction to upper triangular form of the\nresidue matrix in the proof of [5, Lemma III.8.2] can be performed over F .)\nNote 2.5 Since the change of basis matrix H lies in GLr (F [s, s\u22121 ]) one can\nperform global semistable reduction over the whole of the affine basis S. That\nis, after pulling back by a chain of unramified covers Se \u2192 S, effectively find a\nmatrix for the connection which has at worst simple poles at all finite points with\nnilpotent residue matrices. Moreover, this can be done without introducing any\nnew finite poles to the differential system. Alternatively, without a base change\none can effectively find a matrix for the connection with only simple poles at all\nfinite points - this is useful when computing in the cokernel\n1\nm\nHdR\n(S, HdR\n(X/S)) := Coker(\u2207GM )\n\nof the connection \u2207GM [20, Section 4].\n\n2.3\n\nHypersurfaces\n\nThe first significant result of this section is Theorem 2.13, on the construction\nof the Picard-Fuchs differential system for families of projective hypersurfaces.\nOur construction is based upon the method of Griffiths and Dwork. However,\nit differs from the usual presentation in the literature (for example [3, Section\n5.3]) in one key way. We avoid Gr\u00f6bner basis computations, and instead work\nwith linear algebra and Macaulay-style resultant matrices. This has a number\nof benefits. First, it allows us to give an explicit a priori characterisation of\nthe locus of poles of the Picard-Fuchs system w.r.t. a particular basis, and\nthus prove a theorem on explicit semistable reduction for hypersurfaces (Theorem 2.15). Second, it reveals additional structure in the Picard-Fuchs system\n(Corollary 2.14). Third, in the author's own experience, it is faster in practical\nimplementations (Note 2.9). Combining Theorems 2.4 and 2.13 yields Theorem\n2.15, the main result of Section 2.\n9\n\n\f2.3.1\n\nCohomology of the generic hypersurface\n\nIn this section we fix n \u2265 2 and d \u2265 0 and let x0 , x1 , . . . , xn+1 be variables.\nwn+1\nw0 w1\nw\nFor w = (w0 , w1 , . . . , wn+1 ) \u2208 Zn+2\n\u22650 define x := x0 x1 * * * xn+1 and |w| :=\nn+2\nw0 +w1 +* * *+wn+1\nP . For eachww \u2208 Z\u22650 with |w| = d we introduce a variable aw\nand define P := |w|=d aw x to be the \"generic polynomial\" homogeneous of\ndegree d with coefficients in the multivariate polynomial ring R := Z[aw | |w| =\nd].

There exists an explicitly computable non-zero polynomial \u2206n,d \u2208\nR such that the following is true. Define R(1) := R[1/\u2206n,d ] and T := Spec(R(1) ).\nLet X \u2282 Pn+1\nbe the projective hypersurface defined by the polynomial P , and\nT\nlet U be the affine complement of X in Pn+1\n.

This is an explicit computation carried out in the Section 2.3.2.\nDefinition 2.7. We shall say that a hypersurface of degree d and dimension\nn over a field of characteristic zero is smooth and in general position if its\ncoefficients are not zeros of \u2206n,d .\nIt will follow immediately from our definition of \u2206n,d in Section 2.3.2 that\na hypersurface which is \"smooth and in general position\" is indeed smooth.\nWith the notation of the theorem above, there is an algebraically defined\nmap called the residue map\nRes\n\nn+1\nn\nHdR\n(U/T ) \u2192 HdR\n(X/T ).\n\nIt is injective and the image is by (our) definition the primitive middle-dimensional\ncohomology\nn\nHT := Prim HdR\n(X/T ).\nn\nn\nNote that HT = HdR\n(X/T ) when n is odd, and HdR\n(X/T )/HT is free of rank\n1 when n is even. Define\n\nBX := {Res([b]) : b \u2208 BU }.\nCorollary 2.8. With the notation of Theorem 2.6, the set of residues BX is an\nR(1) -basis for the primitive middle-dimensional algebraic de Rham cohomology\nHT of X \u2192 T .\nWe shall call BX the Dwork basis of HT .\n10\n\n\f2.3.2\n\nFrom the universal to the generic hypersurface\n\nThis section contains our explicit proof of Theorem 2.6. We examine the primitive middle-dimensional algebraic de Rham cohomology of a hypersurface, starting with a universal one and then specialising to the generic smooth hypersurface\nand then the hypersurface which is \"smooth and in general position\". Here \"in\ngeneral position\" is a utilitarian definition which allows us to write down a\ncertain basis for cohomology.\nLet us introduce some new notation for use only in this section. For the ring\nR = Z[aw | |w| = d] let Pn+1\ndenote projective space of dimension n + 1 over R.\nR\nLet X/R be the \"universal\"\nprojective\nhypersurface of degree d in Pn+1\ndefined\nR\nP\nw\nby the polynomial P = |w|=d aw x . Denote by U/R its affine complement.\nThen\n\u2022\n(U/R) := H(\u03a9\u2022U/R ) = H(\u0393(U/R, \u03a9\u2022U/R )).\nHdR\nHere H(*) denotes hypercohomology of a complex of sheaves, H(*) homology\nof a complex of modules, and the second equality follows since U/R is affine\nand so the \u010cech-de Rham spectral sequence for computing hypercohomology\ndegenerates at the first term. In particular since \u03a9n+2\nU/R = 0,\nn+1\nHdR\n(U/R)\n\n=\n\n\u0393(U/R, \u03a9n+1\nU/R )\nd\u0393(U/R, \u03a9nU/R )\n\n,\n\nn+1\nwhere d is derivation of n-forms. That is, HdR\n(U/R) is global (closed) (n + 1)forms modulo exact ones.\nn+1\nHere is an explicit description of HdR\n(U/R) - this is due to Griffiths but\na convenient reference is [1, Section 3]. For k \u2265 1 define\n\u001b\n\u001a\nA\u03a9\n|\nA\n\u2208\nR[x\n,\n*\n*\n*\n,\nx\n]\nhomogeneous\ndegree\nkd\n\u2212\nn\n\u2212\n2\n.\nZk :=\n0\nn+1\nPk\n\nThen Zk is the R-module of (n + 1)-forms on Pn+1\ndefined on U/R with poles\nR\nof order at most k along X/R; that is,\nn+1\nZk = \u0393(Pn+1\nR , \u03a9Pn+1 (k(X/R))).\nR\n\nn+1\nNote Zk \u2282 Zk+1 for k \u2265 1. Defining Z := \u222a\u221e\nk=1 Zk we have Z = \u0393(U/R, \u03a9U/R )\nwith the natural filtration by pole order.\nLet b1 = {0} and for k \u2265 2 define bk to be the R-module generated by the\nset\n\u001b\n\u001a\nA(\u03b4i P )\u03a9\n(\u03b4i A)\u03a9\n\u2212 (k \u2212 1)\n| A \u2208 R[x0 , * * * , xn+1 ] homo. deg. (k \u2212 1)d \u2212 n \u2212 1\nP k\u22121\nPk\n\nwhere \u03b4i :=\n\n\u2202\n\u2202xi .\n\nLet Bk be the R-module generated by \u222akj=1 bj . Then\nBk = d\u0393(PnR , \u03a9nPn+1 ((k \u2212 1)(X/R)))\nR\n\n11\n\n\fn\nwhere d is derivation of n-forms. Defining B := \u222a\u221e\nk=1 Bk we have B = d\u0393(U/R, \u03a9U/R )\nfiltered by pole order. Note that Bk \u2286 B \u2229 Zk but there is not an equality: it\nfails for singular hypersurfaces, see [6, Theorem A, (A2)] and the comments\nn+1\nwhich follow. Certainly though HdR\n(U/R) = Z/B.\nSince we are working with the universal hypersurface, the quotient Z/B\nthough presumably finitely generated is complicated. However, by inverting a\nsequence of polynomials in R one can give an explicit procedure for computing\nin this quotient based upon reduction of pole order. This is the Griffiths-Dwork\nmethod. It has been given a conceptual explanation by Dimca. Filtration\nby pole order of \u03a9\u2022U/R allows one to define a spectral sequence with E\u221e =\nn+1\nHdR\n(U/R). This spectral sequence has infinitely many non-zero E1s,t terms\nfor the universal hypersurface, but it degenerate at the E1 term (E1 = E\u221e ) for\nsmooth hypersurfaces (when \"Bk = B \u2229 Zk \") [6, Page 764]. We now give the\nexplicit description.\n(n+1)\nLet \u2206n,d be the \"Macaulay resultant\" of the partial derivatives of P defined in [22, Page 7, Chapter I.6]. Precisely, let it be Macaulay's determinant\n(n+1)\n\"D\", taking \"n\" to be n + 2 and \"Fi \" to be \u03b4i P . Thus \u2206n,d is non-zero but\nvanishes on the coefficients of homogeneous polynomials of degree d which define\nsingular hypersurfaces of dimension n (and also possibly on the coefficients of\n(n+1)\nsome other polynomials). Define R(n+1) := R[1/\u2206n,d ] and for any R-module\n\u2022 let \u2022(n+1) := \u2022 \u2297R R(n+1) . Then we have\n(n+1)\n\nZk\n\n(n+1)\n\n= Bk\n\n(n+1)\n\n+ Zn+1\n\nfor k \u2265 n + 1.\n\n(n+1)\n\nThis follows since after inverting \u2206n,d one may use linear algebra (via the\nmatrix whose determinant is the Macaulay resultant) to reduce any (n + 1)(n+1)\n(n+1)\nform in Zk\nmodulo exact forms (in Bk\n) to have pole order at most\nn + 1. It follows\n(n+1)\n(n+1)\nZ (n+1) /B (n+1) \u223c\n= Zn+1 /(B (n+1) \u2229 Zn+1 )\n(n+1)\n\nand so Z (n+1) /B (n+1) is finitely generated. Note that since certainly Bn+1 \u2286\n(n+1)\n(n+1)\n(n+1)\nB (n+1) \u2229 Zn+1 we have Z (n+1) /B (n+1) is a quotient of Zn+1 /Bn+1 ; in fact,\n(n+1)\n(n+1)\nBn+1 = B (n+1) \u2229 Zn+1 by [6, Theorem A, (A2)] and the two are equal.\n(n+1)\nThe quotient Z\n/B (n+1) is locally free, but it is not free in general without further localisation which will depend upon a choice of basis. Now BU is a\nbasis generically since it is a basis for the de Rham cohomology of the complement of the diagonal hypersurface xd0 + * * * + xdn+1 = 0. (Over C the action of\nthe (n + 2)-fold product of the group of dth roots of unity decomposes into characters via this basis.) Write BU,k := BU \u2229 Zk , an intersection as sets. One can\nnow construct an explicit Macaulay-style matrix depending on BU,n+1 whose\n(n)\n(n)\ndeterminant \u2206n,d is such that defining R(n) := R(n+1) [1/\u2206n,d ] one has\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(n)\n(n)\nZ (n) /B (n) \u223c\n= hBU,n+1 iR(n) \u2295 Zn(n) /Bn(n) .\n= Zn+1 /Bn+1 \u223c\n12\n\n\fHere we are following the same convention for base extension of an R-module\n\u2022, that is, \u2022(n) := \u2022 \u2297R R(n) . In words, every (n + 1)-form with a pole of order\nat most n + 1 can be written modulo an exact form of pole order at most n + 1\nas an R(n) -linear combination of the basis forms in BU,n+1 plus a form of pole\norder at most n.\n(k)\n(k)\nThis continues inductively, defining \u2206n,d and R(k) := R(k+1) [1/\u2206n,d ] for\nk = n \u2212 1, . . . , 1 at each step so that\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(k)\n(k)\nZ (k) /B (k) \u223c\nB\ni\n\u2295\nZ\n/B\n(2)\n(k)\n= h\u222an+1\nl=k+1 U,l R\nk\nk\nand this isomorphism is effectively computable via linear algebra. Finally noting\n(1)\n(1)\nZ1 /B1 \u223c\n= hBU,1 iR(1) one finds\nZ (1) /B (1) \u223c\n= hBU iR(1) .\nQn+1 (k)\nFinally define \u2206n,d := k=1 \u2206n,d so that R(1) = R[1/\u2206n,d], and let T :=\nSpec(R(1) ). Writing \"U/T \" to denote U \u2297R R(1) /R(1) one has Theorem 2.6.\nNote 2.9 The exact description of the Macaulay-style matrices whose deter(k)\nminants are the polynomials \u2206n,d , and the method for using these matrices to\nmake the isomorphisms above explicit is a little involved; see [19] for the details\nin a closely analogous situation, or [27] for full details of this construction. The\nmethod has been implemented in code by S. Pancratz and seems well-suited\nto computing Picard-Fuchs systems for families of hypersurfaces; see [27] and\nthe proof of Theorem 2.13. Our computations of Picard-Fuchs systems for the\nexamples in Section 5 actually use a slower implementation due to the author,\nwhich exploits the Gr\u00f6bner basis routines for the rational function field Q(t) in\nthe programming language Magma.\n2.3.3\n\nComputation of the Picard-Fuchs system\n\nLet F be a computable field of characteristic zero. Let Pt \u2208 F [t][x0 , x1 , * * * , xn+1 ]\nbe a homogeneous polynomial of degree d in the variables x0 , x1 , . . . , xn+1 with\ncoefficients in the polynomial ring F [t]. Let Yt \u2282 Pn+1\nF (t) be the hypersurface\ndefined by the equation Pt = 0. We shall assume that Yt is smooth and\nin general position, see Definition 2.7. Denote by \u2206n,d (Pt ) \u2208 F [t] the nonzero polynomial obtained by specialising \u2206n,d at the coefficients of Pt . Let\n\u2206(t) \u2208 F [t] be any non-zero polynomial which contains \u2206n,d (Pt ) as a factor.\nDefine A := F [t, 1/\u2206(t)] and S := Spec(A). Let X \u2282 Pn+1\nbe the scheme\nS\ndefined by Pt = 0 and U be its affine complement.\nNote 2.10 One is really just interested in the case \u2206(t) := \u2206n,d (Pt ) but it is\nharmless to excise some additional fibres and allowing this eases the statements\nof some results.\n\n13\n\n\fCorollary 2.11. The set of cohomology classes {[b] | b \u2208 BU } is an A-basis for\nn+1\nHdR\n(U/S).\nHere the P in the definition of BU should be specialised to Pt .\nn+1\nProof. By Theorem 2.6, noting HdR\n(U/R) is a quotient Z/B and tensor product of rings \u2022 \u2297R(1) A is right exact.\nn\nLetting H denote the primitive part of HdR\n(X/S) we deduce the following.\n\nCorollary 2.12. The Dwork basis BX is an A-basis for H.\nWe can now present our theorem on Picard-Fuchs systems for projective\nhypersurfaces.\nTheorem 2.13. The matrix N (t) for the Gauss-Manin connection \u2207 restricted\nto the primitive middle-dimensional cohomology H of X \u2192 S with respect to\nthe Dwork basis BX is effectively computable.\nProof. Equivalently, we compute the Gauss-Manin connection on the basis of\nn+1\nHdR\n(U/S) given by classes of forms in BU .

Then H is\nthe Hodge filtration on H.

Specifically, for\n(k)\n(k)\n1 \u2264 k \u2264 n + 1 let \u2206n,d (Pt ) denote the specialisation of the polynomial \u2206n,d\n(0)\n\nfrom Section 2.3.2 at the coefficients of Pt . Define \u2206n,d (Pt ) := 1.\n\n14\n\n\fCorollary 2.14. Let N (t) be the Picard-Fuchs matrix w.r.t. the Dwork basis,\nand Nk,l (1 \u2264 k, l \u2264 n + 1) the block of entries which gives for b \u2208 BU,l the\ncoefficients in \u2207(b) of the elements in BU,k . Then for k \u2212 1 \u2264 l the matrix\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nl\nY\n(j)\n\uf8ed\n\u2206n,d (Pt )\uf8f8 Nk,l\nj=k\u22121\n\nhas entries in F [t]. For k > l + 1 we have Nk,l = 0 (Griffiths's transversality).\n\nProof. Let b \u2208 BU,l . Then by (3), \u2207(b) can be represented by a differential\nform with pole order l + 1 along X. Now use the explicit pole reduction method\nat the end of Section 2.3.2, specialising P to Pt and tensoring R-modules by\n\u2022 \u2297R F [t], to write this as an F (t)-linear combination of the basis BU , dividing\n(j)\nby \u2206n,d (Pt ) (1 \u2264 j \u2264 l) when reducing pole orders from j + 1 to j modulo exact\nforms. Precisely, when one has reduced modulo exact forms to a get pole of order\nQ\n(j)\nk plus an F [t, 1/ lj=k \u2206n,d (Pt )]-linear combination of \u222alj=k+1 BU,j , one needs to\nQl\n(j)\n(k\u22121)\ndivide by \u2206n,d (Pt ) to obtain an F [t, 1/ j=k\u22121 \u2206n,d (Pt )]-linear combination\nl\nof \u222aj=k BU,j modulo an exact form and a form of pole order k \u2212 1, cf. (2).\nIn particular, provided \u2206n,d (Pt ) is squarefree then the Picard-Fuchs matrix\nhas simple poles at the finite points. This is true generically if \u2206n,d itself is\nsquarefree, which in turn follows if one finds one specialisation of maximum\ndegree which is squarefree; that is, one suitable family. The author expects that\na Lefschetz pencil would work, but he has not proved this.\n2.3.4\n\nSemistable reduction for hypersurfaces\n\nWe come to the main theorem of Section 2.3. Recall that for e a positive integer\nand S = Spec(F [t, 1/\u2206(t)]), we define Se := Spec(F [s, 1/\u2206(se )]) with Se \u2192 S\ndefined by t 7\u2192 se and write Xe := X \u00d7S Se .\nTheorem 2.15. There exists an explicit deterministic algorithm with the following input and output. The input to the algorithm is a homogeneous polynomial Pt \u2208 F [t][x0 , x1 , . . . , xn ] and a polynomial \u2206(t) \u2208 F [t] such that writing\nS := Spec(F [t, 1/\u2206(t)]) the fibres in the family X \u2192 S defined by Pt are smooth\nand in general position. The output is a positive integer e, a basis Be for the\nprimitive middle-dimensional cohomology of Xe \u2192 Se and a matrix N (t) for\nthe Gauss-Manin connection \u2207e on this basis which has only a simple pole at\ns = 0 with nilpotent residue matrix.\nProof. By Theorem 2.13 one can compute the matrix for the Gauss-Manin\nconnection \u2207 on the primitive middle-dimensional cohomology of X \u2192 S. If\n\u2206(0) 6= 0 then we are done. Otherwise, Theorem 2.4 performs the necessary\npull-back Se \u2192 S and change of basis defined over the whole of Se .\n\n15\n\n\f3\n\nDegenerations in positive characteristic\n\nLet Fq be the finite field with q elements of characteristic p, K be the unique\nunramified extension of the field of p-adic numbers Qp of degree logp (q), and W\nbe the ring of integers of K. Let K\u0304 denote an algebraic closure of K.\n\n3.1\n\nRelative rigid cohomology\n\nLet X \u2192 S be a morphism of W -schemes where S is an open subscheme of A1W .\nDefinition 3.1. We shall say that \"Assumption (SP) holds\" if either X \u2192 S is\nsmooth and proper, or it is the restriction of a smooth and proper morphism to\nthe complement of a normal crossings divisor with smooth components over S.\nWe shall assume throughout Section 3 that Assumption (SP) holds. Write\nS := Spec(A) where A = W [t, 1/\u2206(t)] for some polynomial \u2206(t) \u2208 W [t]. We\nassume that p does not divide \u2206(t). Let XK \u2192 SK and X \u2192 S denote maps on\ngeneric and special fibres, respectively. Let AK := A \u2297W K and define A\u2020K to\nbe the weak completion of A tensored by K. Precisely, denote the completion\nof A w.r.t. the Gaussian norm [5, Page 10] by \u00c2. Then A\u2020K consists of series\nin \u00c2 \u2297W K which converge on P1K\u0304 with open disks of some unspecified radius\nless than one around the roots of \u2206(t) and infinity removed. Thus A\u2020K has a\np-adic valuation ordp (*), and one may extend this to matrix rings over A\u2020K in\nthe obvious way. Define the Frobenius \u03c3 : A\u2020K \u2192 A\u2020K by \u03c3 : t 7\u2192 tp and let it\nact on coefficients by the usual Frobenius automorphism of K.\nm\nLet Hrig\n(X/S) denote the mth relative rigid cohomology of X \u2192 S. (We\nrefer to [7, Section 2], [20, Section 3] and [21] for details and references on the\nconstruction of relative rigid cohomology.) This is a locally free A\u2020K -module of\nfinite rank equipped with a connection \u2207rig and \u03c3-linear Frobenius F which\ncommute, in the following sense. By Assumption (SP) we have the comparison\ntheorem [20, Theorem 3.1]\nm\nm\nHrig\n(X/S) \u223c\n(XK /SK ) \u2297AK A\u2020K .\n= HdR\n\n(4)\n\nm\nSince HdR\n(XK /SK ) is a locally free module over a principal ideal domain it\nm\nis free. Thus Hrig\n(X/S) is actually a free A\u2020K -module. Let B be a basis for\nm\nHdR (XK /SK ) and N (t) the matrix for the Gauss-Manin connection \u2207 w.r.t.\nm\nB. Write Brig := {b \u2297 1A\u2020 } for the associated basis of Hrig\n(X/S). Then by\nK\nthe comparison theorem the matrix for \u2207rig w.r.t. Brig is also N (t). Let F (t)\ndenote the matrix for Frobenius F w.r.t. Brig . Thus F (t) has entries in A\u2020K .\nThe matrix F (t) is invertible and\n\ndF\n+ N (t)F (t) = F (t)\u03c3(N (t))ptp\u22121 .\ndt\nThis equation exactly describes the \"commutativity\" of \u2207rig and F.\n\n16\n\n(5)\n\n\fDenote by R the Robba ring around t = 0 [14, Chapter 15.1]. That is, the\nring of two-way infinite Laurent series with coefficients in K which converge\non some open annulus of outer radius one and unspecified inner radius r < 1\naround the origin. From the definition of A\u2020K one sees there is an embedding\nA\u2020K \u0592\u2192 R via local expansions. Letting K((t)) denote the usual ring of one-way\ninfinite Laurent series one may embed AK \u0592\u2192 K((t)). Thus the entries of N (t)\nand F (t) may be expanded locally around t = 0 to give elements in K((t)) and\nR respectively.\n\n3.2\n3.2.1\n\nLimiting Frobenius structures\nA surprising lemma\n\nSuppose that \u2206(0) = 0: then when one embeds entries in the matrix F (t) into\nthe Robba ring R one expects infinitely many non-zero negative power terms\nin their Laurent series expansions. The following result is surprising and rather\ndeep.\nP\u221e\nLemma 3.2. Let N (t) = i=\u22121 Ni ti be an r \u00d7 r matrix such that the entries\nof tN are power series over K\nin the open unit disk, and N\u22121 is a\nPconvergent\n\u221e\nnilpotent matrix. Let F (t) = i=\u2212\u221e Fi ti be an r \u00d7 r matrix whose entries are\n(two-way infinite) Laurent series over K convergent on some open annulus with\nouter radius 1. Suppose N and F satisfy (5). Then Fi = 0 for i < 0, so F (t)\nconverges on the whole open unit disk.\nProof. This is exactly [13, Lemma 6.5.7], which in turn is a consequence of\n[14, Proposition 17.5.1]. The proof has two steps. First, one assumes that\ntN (t) = N0 , a nilpotent matrix. Then (5) becomes\nt\n\ndF\n+ N0 F = pF \u03c3(N0 ).\ndt\n\nNow compare coefficients of ti on both sides and observe that the map on\nmatrices X 7\u2192 N0 X + X(i \u2212 p\u03c3(N0 )) has all eigenvalues equal to i since N0\nand \u03c3(N0 ) are nilpotent, by [5, Lemma III.8.4]. Hence we see Fi = 0 for i 6= 0.\nNext, to reduce the general case to the case tN (t) = N0 one uses a deep \"transfer\ntheorem\" of Christol and Dwork [14, Theorem 13.7.1].\nNote 3.3 The choice of Frobenius lift t 7\u2192 tp is key to the proof - this was\nstressed to the author by Kiran Kedlaya. In the original deformation algorithm,\nthe author used the lift s 7\u2192 sp where s is the local parameter around t = 1; that\nis, t 7\u2192 (t \u2212 1)p + 1. With this choice of lift one expects an essential singularity\nat t = 0 in F (t) unless the family X/S has a \"smooth extension\" over the origin.\nThis simple observation is the key to extending the deformation method to the\ncase of degenerations - it eluded the author for many years.\n\n17\n\n\f3.2.2\n\nDefinition and uniqueness\n\nWe now define our limiting Frobenius structures. Note that in this section\nm\nall bases Brig for Hrig\n(X/S) arise by extension of scalars from a basis B of\nm\nHdR (XK /SK ).\nDefinition 3.4. Let F (t) and N (t) be the matrices for the Frobenius and conm\nnection, respectively, w.r.t. some basis Brig of Hrig\n(X/S). Assume that the\nhypotheses of Lemma 3.2 are satisfied. Write N0 := (tN (t))t=0 for the nilpotent\nresidue matrix, F0 := F (0) and H0 := hBrig iK . Then by equation (5) we have\nN0 F0 = pF0 \u03c3(N0 ). We call (H0 , N0 , F0 ) the limiting Frobenius structure (in\ndimension m of the family X \u2192 S) at t = 0 w.r.t. the basis Brig .\nLemma 3.5. With notation and hypotheses as in Definition 3.4, the matrix F0\nis invertible.\nProof. Define M := \u2212N t and G := (F \u22121 )t . Then the pair (M, G) is the \"dual\noverconvergent F -isocrystal\" and satisfies the differential equation\ndG\n+ M (t)G(t) = G(t)\u03c3(M (t))ptp\u22121 .\ndt\nNow tM (t) converges on the p-adic open unit disk and M\nhas residue matrix\nP(t)\n\u221e\n\u2212N0t , which is nilpotent. Hence by Lemma 3.2, G(t) = i=0 Gi ti converges on\nthe open unit disk. But F Gt = I and so F0 Gt0 = I and F0 is invertible.\nLemma 3.6. Assume there are two bases Brig and B\u2032rig which satisfy the hypothesis in Definition 3.4. Let (H0 , N0 , F0 ) and (H0\u2032 , N0\u2032 , F0\u2032 ) be the associated\nlimiting Frobenius structures at t = 0. Then there exists an invertible matrix\nH0 over K such that N0\u2032 = H0 N0 H0\u22121 and F0\u2032 = H0 F0 \u03c3(H0 ).\nProof. Let H(t) be the local expansion around the origin of the change of basis matrix from B to B\u2032 ; hence also from Brig to B\u2032rig . Let N (t) and N (t)\u2032\ndenote the connection matrices w.r.t. the two bases, and N0 = (tN (t))t=0 ,\nN0\u2032 = (tN (t)\u2032 )t=0 the two nilpotent matrices. (Beware here and elsewhere that\nthe prime superscript has nothing to do with differentiation.) Then (tN \u2032 ) =\n\u22121\n\u2212s\nand so (tN \u2032 )H \u2212 H(tN ) = t dH\n+\nH(tN )H \u22121 + t dH\ndt H\ndt . Write H(t) = H\u2212s t\n\u2032\n* * * as a Laurent series with matrix coefficients where H\u2212s 6= 0. So N0 H\u2212s \u2212\nH\u2212s N0 = \u2212sH\u2212s . But the operator on matrices X 7\u2192 N0\u2032 X \u2212 XN0 has eigenvalues the difference of the eigenvalues of the two nilpotent matrices N0 and\nN0\u2032 , by [5, Lemma III.8.4]. That is, its eigenvalues are all zero. So s = 0\nand H has entries in K[[t]]. By a symmetrical argument so does H \u22121 and\nso H(t) = H0 + H1 t + * * * where H0 is invertible. Thus N0\u2032 = H0 N0 H0\u22121 .\nSince the Frobenius map F is \u03c3-linear, the change of basis formula shows\nF0\u2032 = H0 F0 \u03c3(H0 ).\nThus we may speak of \"the\" limiting Frobenius structure (H0 , N0 , F0 ) as an\nabstract triple of a vector space H0 over K, a nilpotent linear operator N0 and\nan invertible \u03c3-linear operator F0 such that N0 F0 = pF0 N0 , provided it exists\nw.r.t. at least one basis.\n18\n\n\f3.2.3\n\nExistence\n\nThe limiting Frobenius structure might only exist after making a cover of the\nbase. We now prove the existence of a \"smallest\" limiting Frobenius structure\nunder a lifting hypothesis.\nFor e a positive integer, write Ae := W [s, 1/\u2206(se )], (AK )e := K[s, 1/\u2206(se )]\nand (A\u2020K )e for the weak completion of Ae tensored by K. Define A \u2192 Ae ,\nAK \u2192 (AK )e and A\u2020K \u2192 (A\u2020K )e by t 7\u2192 se . Let Se := Spec(Ae ), so there is\na morphism Se \u2192 S. One may pull-back the family X \u2192 S via Se \u2192 S to get\nXe \u2192 Se where Xe := X \u00d7S Se . Write Xe \u2192 Se and (XK )e \u2192 (SK )e for the\nmaps on special and generic fibres. The morphism Xe \u2192 Se is smooth (even\nwhen p divides e and Se \u2192 S is not) and we have as before\nm\nm\nHrig\n(Xe /Se ) \u223c\n((XK )e /(SK )e ) \u2297(AK )e (A\u2020K )e .\n= HdR\n\n(6)\n\nDefinition 3.7. Assume that the hypotheses of Definition 3.4 are satisfied for\nthe family Xe \u2192 Se after pulling back the base Se \u2192 S for some positive integer\ne. Let (H0 , N0 , F0 ) be the limiting Frobenius structure for Xe \u2192 Se at s = 0.\nWe call (H0 , N0 , F0 , e) a limiting Frobenius structure for X \u2192 S at t = 0.\nNote that if one has a chain of covers Se\u2032 \u2192 Se \u2192 S and a limiting Frobenius\nstructure (H0 , N0 , F0 , e) \"on\" Se one may pull it back to a limiting Frobenius\nstructure (H0 , (e\u2032 /e)N0 , F0 , e\u2032 ) \"on\" Se\u2032 . We then say that the latter factors\nthrough the former.\nWe now state our main theorem on the existence of limiting Frobenius structures. Recall that Assumption (SP) is still in place. We shall call the p-adic\nopen unit disk around t = 0 with the origin removed the \"punctured\" p-adic\nopen unit disk around t = 0.\nTheorem 3.8. Assume that the polynomial \u2206(t) has no zeros in K\u0304 within the\npunctured p-adic open unit disk around t = 0. Then a limiting Frobenius structure (H0 , N0 , F0 , e) at t = 0 exists. Moreover, there exists a unique \"smallest\"\nsuch limiting Frobenius structure, such that any other factors through it.\nm\nProof. Let B be any basis for HdR\n(XK /SK ), r be the size of this basis, and\nN (t) the matrix for the Gauss-Manin connection w.r.t. this basis. The matrix\nN (t) converges on the punctured p-adic open unit disk around t = 0, since it\nhas poles only at the roots of \u2206(t). Theorem 2.4 guarantees the existence of a\nsmallest positive integer e and change of basis matrix H \u2208 GLr (K[s, s\u22121 ]) (here\nt = se ) such that the matrix for the Gauss-Manin connection on (Be )[H(s)] has\nonly a simple pole at s = 0 with nilpotent residue matrix. Here e is taken\nto be the lowest common multiple of the denominators of the eigenvalues \u03bbi\nof the residue matrix which occur in the proof of Theorem 2.4. (Note that the\nhypothesis of computability on the base field F is only used to establish that the\nchange of basis matrix H(s) is computable.) Denote this connection matrix by\nN (s)\u2032 . Since H \u2208 GLr (K[s, s\u22121 ]), the matrix N (s)\u2032 converges on the punctured\np-adic open unit disk around s = 0. Thus the hypotheses of Definition 3.7 apply\n\n19\n\n\fafter making the base change Se \u2192 S and we may define a limiting Frobenius\nstructure at t = 0.\nA necessary condition for the existence of a limiting Frobenius structure\nafter pulling back the base Se\u2032 \u2192 S is that e\u2032 \u03bbi are integers. Hence for any such\ne\u2032 we have that e divides e\u2032 , hence Se\u2032 \u2192 S factors through Se \u2192 S. Thus we\ncan pull back the limiting Frobenius structure (H0 , N0 , F0 , e) via Se\u2032 \u2192 Se and\napply Lemma 3.6 for the final claim.\nWe call the \"smallest\" limiting Frobenius structure which occurs in Theorem\n3.8, \"the\" limiting Frobenius structure at t = 0.\nNote 3.9 Provided the characteristic p does not divide e, then the morphism\nSe \u2192 S reduces to an unramified cover Se \u2192 S. Thus here we have made the\nm\noverconvergent F -isocrystal Hrig\n(X/S) \"unipotent around zero\" after making\nan unramified cover of the base S. So our construction here agrees with one\narising from the semistable reduction theorem. If p divides e then our construction seems unnatural, since the cover Se \u2192 S is totally ramified. The author\nsuspects that the hypothesis on \u2206(t) in Theorem 3.8 cannot be satisfied when\nthe order e of the finite part of the local monodromy around the origin of the\nfamily XK \u2192 SK is divisible by p. He has a few examples which suggest this,\nbut no conceptual explanation as to why the order of the monodromy should\nbe related to roots of \u2206(t) within the punctured p-adic open unit disk.\nLet us conclude with a definition which brings together the properties required for Theorem 3.8 to hold.\nDefinition 3.10. We shall say that a morphism X \u2192 S \u2286 A1Fq of Fq -varieties\nhas a good lift around zero if it arises by base change from a morphism X \u2192 S of\nW -schemes with the following property. Assumption (SP) is satisfied (Definition\n3.1), and writing S = Spec(W [t, 1/\u2206(t)]) the polynomial \u2206(t) has no zeros in\nK\u0304 within the punctured p-adic open unit disk around zero.\nSo by Theorem 3.8, limiting Frobenius structures exist when one has a good\nlift around zero.\n3.2.4\n\nComputability: definitions and a sketch\n\nWe now turn to the question of computing limiting Frobenius structures. The\nfield K is uncountable and thus we immediately encounter two problems. First,\none cannot perform exact arithmetic in K. Second, we cannot directly apply the\nresults of Section 2, since there the base field F is assumed to be countable. A\nconvenient solution to both problems is to work in a suitable algebraic number\nfield L \u2282 K, using exact arithmetic in L when we wish to apply the \"algebraic\"\ntheory from Section 2, and approximating elements in K by those in L during\nthe \"analytic\" parts of the algorithm.\nPrecisely, assume that we have an algebraic number field L with ring of\nintegers OL in which the prime p is inert with residue field Fq . We have the\n\n20\n\n\fnatural embedding OL \u0592\u2192 W given by localisation at p. First, we give an\n\"algebraic\" version of Definition 3.10.\nDefinition 3.11. We shall say that a morphism X \u2192 S \u2286 A1Fq of Fq -varieties\nhas a good algebraic lift around zero if it arises by base change from a morphism\nXOL \u2192 SOL of OL -schemes with the following property. Assumption (SP) is\nsatisfied for X := XOL \u00d7OL W \u2192 S := SOL \u00d7OL W (Definition 3.1), and writing\nSOL = Spec(OL [t, 1/\u2206(t)]) the polynomial \u2206(t) has no zeros in K\u0304 within the\npunctured p-adic open unit disk around zero.\nWhen we have a good algebraic lift XOL \u2192 SOL , write XL \u2192 SL for the\nbase change by \u2022 \u2297OL L. By Theorem 3.8 \"the\" limiting Frobenius structure\n(H0 , N0 , F0 , e) exists for X \u2192 S when one has a good algebraic lift around zero.\nUnfortunately, we cannot hope to compute it, since any matrix for F0 has entries\nin the uncountable field K. Thus we need a notion of an \"approximate\" limiting\nFrobenius structure.\nFor N and r positive integers and F0 \u2208 GLr (K), we shall call a matrix\nF\u03030 \u2208 GLr (L) a pN -approximation to F0 if ordp (F\u03030 \u2212 F0 ) \u2265 N .\nDefinition 3.12. Let N be a positive integer. Assume that X \u2192 S has a good\nalgebraic lift around zero. A pN -approximation to the limiting Frobenius structure at t = 0 in dimension m for the smooth morphism X \u2192 S is a quadruple\n(H0 , N0 , F\u03030 , e) with the following properties,\n\u2022 H0 is a vector space over K, N0 a nilpotent matrix over L, and F\u03030 an\ninvertible matrix over L.\n\u2022 the limiting Frobenius structure for X \u2192 S in dimension m at t = 0 exists\nand w.r.t. some basis is (H0 , N0 , F0 , e) with F\u03030 a pN -approximation to\nF0 .\nThe \"algebraic\" part of the algorithm for computing approximate limiting\nm\n((XL )e /(SL )e ) such\nFrobenius structures is to find an integer e and basis for HdR\nthat the matrix for the connection has a simple pole at s = 0 with nilpotent\nresidue matrix. (We use analogous notation for pulling back SL -schemes via the\nmorphism t 7\u2192 se as before; that is, introduce a subscript e.) This allows us to\ncompute exactly the nilpotent monodromy matrix N0 , and of course the integer\ne. The following theorem shows this can be accomplished provided we know the\nm\nconnection matrix on some initial basis for HdR\n(XL /SL ).\nTheorem 3.13. There exists an explicit deterministic algorithm with the following input and output. The input is a matrix for the Gauss-Manin connection\nm\n\u2207 w.r.t. some basis of HdR\n(XL /SL ), where X \u2192 S has a good algebraic lift\naround t = 0 . The output is a matrix N (s) for \u2207e w.r.t. some explicit basis of\nm\n((XL )e /(SL )e ) such that N (s) converges on the punctured p-adic open unit\nHdR\ndisk around s = 0 and has a simple pole at s = 0 with nilpotent residue matrix.\nProof. Let B be the basis used for the input. Then the connection matrix w.r.t.\nthis basis has only poles at the roots of \u2206(t) and thus converges on the punctured\n21\n\n\fp-adic open unit disk around t = 0. Now we apply Theorem 2.4 exactly as in\nthe proof of Theorem 3.8 noting that L is computable.\nThe \"analytic\" part of the algorithm is to compute a suitable approximation\nto the matrix for Frobenius on this basis. Let us first formalise our notion of\napproximate Frobenius matrices. For e \u2265 1 define as before (A\u2020K )e to be the\nweak completion of W [s, 1/\u2206(se )] tensored by K. Write (AL )e := L[s, 1/\u2206(se )]\nand note that (AL )e \u0592\u2192 (A\u2020K )e . Let N and r be positive integers. We call\nF\u0303 (s) \u2208 GLr ((AL )e ) a pN -approximation to F (s) \u2208 GLr ((A\u2020K )e ) if ordp (F\u0303 (s) \u2212\nF (s)) \u2265 N . Thus our aim is to compute a pN -approximation F\u0303 (s) to the matrix\nF (s) for Frobenius on this basis, and then \"specialise\" this approximation at\ns = 0 to obtain a pN -approximation F\u03030 to F0 . The approximation F\u0303 (s) can be\nfound using the original deformation method.\nRather than state a formal theorem on approximate computability of limiting\nFrobenius structures in this general setting, let us focus now on the case of\ndegenerations of projective hypersurfaces.\n\n3.3\n\nHypersurfaces\n\nIn this section we prove our main result (Theorem 3.15) on the computability\nof limiting Frobenius structures for degenerations of hypersurfaces, and discuss\nthe asymptotic complexity of the algorithm underlying this theorem (Section\n3.3.2).\n3.3.1\n\nComputability of limiting Frobenius structures\n\nLet us make a convenient definition to ease the statement of our main theorem.\nAs before OL is the ring of integers of an algebraic number field L which is inert\nat the rational prime p with residue field Fq , and OL \u0592\u2192 W is the embedding.\nNow take F to be the computable field L and define notation in a similar\nmanner to the first paragraph of Section 2.3.3 but taking Pt to have coefficients\nin OL [t] instead of L[t]. Precisely, let \u2206(t) \u2208 OL [t] be any polynomial which\nhas as a factor the polynomial \u2206n,d (Pt ) defined by specialising \u2206n,d at the\ncoefficients of Pt . Assume \u2206(t) 6= 0. Let SOL := Spec(OL [t, 1/\u2206(t)]) and\nXOL \u2282 Pn+1\nSOL be the scheme defined by Pt = 0. Denote by X \u2192 S (respectively\nXL \u2192 SL ) the morphism of Fq -varieties (respectively L-varieties) obtained by\ntensoring XOL \u2192 SOL by \u2022 \u2297OL Fq (respectively \u2022 \u2297OL L). So each fibre in the\nfamily XL \u2192 SL is smooth and in general position (Definition 2.7). Now make\nthe additional assumption that \u2206(1) 6= 0 mod p and \u2206(t) has no zeros in the\npunctured p-adic open unit disk around t = 0.\nDefinition 3.14. We shall say that a smooth family of hypersurfaces X \u2192 S of\ndegree d over Fq is in general position and has a good algebraic lift around t = 0\nif it arises by reduction modulo p from a morphism XOL \u2192 SOL of OL -schemes\nof the type described in the paragraph immediately above.\n\n22\n\n\fTheorem 3.15. There exists an explicit deterministic algorithm which takes as\ninput a positive integer N and a smooth family of hypersurfaces X \u2192 S over\nFq which is in general position and has a good algebraic lift around t = 0, and\ngives as output a pN -approximation to the primitive middle-dimensional limiting\nFrobenius structure at t = 0 of the family X \u2192 S.\nProof. Let B := BXL be the Dwork basis for the primitive middle-dimensional\ncohomology of XL \u2192 SL . Theorem 2.13 shows that one may compute the matrix\nN (t) for the Gauss-Manin connection on B. Theorem 3.13 then allows us to\ncompute the pull-back (SOL )e \u2192 SOL and basis change matrix H(s) needed so\nthat the Picard-Fuchs matrix N (s)\u2032 , say, w.r.t. the basis (Be )[H(s)] has a simple\npole at s = 0 with nilpotent residue matrix and converges on the punctured\np-adic open unit disk. Let \u2212\u03b4 be the minimum of the p-adic orders of H(s)\nand H(s)\u22121 . Suppose that one can compute a pN +2\u03b4 -approximation F\u0303 (t) to the\nmatrix for Frobenius F (t) on Brig . Then by substituting t = se and changing\nbasis by H(s) one obtains a pN -approximation F\u0303 (s)\u2032 , say, to the matrix for\nFrobenius F (s)\u2032 on (Brig,e )[H(s)] . By Lemma 3.2 the matrix F (s)\u2032 has no pole\nat s = 0 and specialising sN (s)\u2032 and F\u0303 (s)\u2032 at s = 0 gives the data of a pN approximation of the limiting Frobenius structure. (One has to take some care\nin \"specialising\" F\u0303 (s)\u2032 at s = 0 as this matrix may have a pole. To obtain\nan approximation of F (0)\u2032 embed the entries of F\u0303 (s)\u2032 in L((t)) and take the\ncoefficient of t0 .)\nTo compute the matrix F\u0303 (t) itself we use the deformation method. This\nrequires two inputs. First, the Picard-Fuchs matrix N (t). Second, the matrix\nn\nfor the Frobenius action on the basis B1 of Hrig\n(X1 ) obtained from Brig via\nn\nn\n\u223c\nHrig (X1 ) = Hrig (X/S) \u2297A\u2020 K (t 7\u2192 1) [20, Theorem 3.2]. The matrix for the\nK\nFrobenius action on the fibre is needed to some higher p-adic precision, due\nto precision loss during the deformation method. Precisions required can be\ncalculated as in [13, Section 6], [20, Section 5]. One uses Kedlaya's algorithm\nto calculate the Frobenius matrix at the fibre t = 1 [1, Section 3.5].\nNote 3.16 Note that here Assumption (SP) is satisfied, since the primitive\ncohomology is just that of the family of complements of the smooth hypersurfaces in Pn+1\nW . Of course, by primitive middle-dimensional limiting Frobenius\nstructure we mean the limiting Frobenius structure in the middle dimension for\nthis family of complements. Indeed, there is a small clash of notation between\nSection 2 and 3 - we really wish to take the family \"X \u2192 S\" in Section 3 to\nbe the family of complements of hypersurfaces, not the family \"XL \u2192 SL \" of\nhypersurfaces itself.\n\n3.3.2\n\nComplexity\n\nWe do not attempt an asymptotic analysis of the algorithm in Theorem 3.15,\nbut confine ourselves instead to a few comments.\n\n23\n\n\fAssume that the matrix for the Gauss-Manin connection w.r.t. to the Dwork\nbasis has a simple pole with nilpotent residue matrix. Then our algorithm is\nexactly the same as the original deformation method, except that we use the\nFrobenius lift t 7\u2192 tp rather than t \u2212 1 7\u2192 (t \u2212 1)p (Note 3.3). When we solve\nthe Picard-Fuchs differential system locally around t = 1 during the algorithm,\nusing the lift t 7\u2192 tp is slower in practice than using the lift (t \u2212 1) 7\u2192 (t \u2212 1)p (cf.\n[20, Section 5.1]); however, provided one uses the \"Tsuzuki method\" [20, Section\n5.1.2] the asymptotic complexity is the same. To obtain asymptotic complexity\nbounds, it is simpler to assume that one only computes the matrix for the\nconnection w.r.t. the Dwork basis to a suitable p-adic precision rather than as\nan exact matrix of rational functions over an algebraic number field. This is all\nworked out explicitly in the analogous setting of \"Dwork cohomology\" in [19,\nSections 5, 6.1, 10: Step 2]. By comparison with the analysis in [20, Section 10],\none sees that using an approximate connection matrix our algorithm certainly\nhas running time which is polynomial in p, logp (q), (d + 1)n and N .\nA necessary condition for our assumption on the connection matrix to be\nmet is that the pull-back e = 1, and hence the Picard-Lefschetz transformation is unipotent, cf. Theorem 4.2. When this geometric condition is met (for\nexample, a semistable degeneration of curves) then the author has observed\nthat frequently in practice our assumption on the connection matrix holds true.\nHowever, it is certainly not the case that it is always true, and the author does\nnot understand its true geometric significance, if any.\nWhen the matrix for the connection does not have a simple pole with nilpotent residue matrix w.r.t. the Dwork basis, then the author makes no claims\non the complexity of the algorithm. Computing pull-backs and using shearing\ntransformations to prepare eigenvalues is not too problematic - both were usually necessary for the examples in Section 5. The most time consuming problem\nin practice is when there is not even a simple pole, and one needs to use a cyclic\nvector; see Example 5.8.\n\n3.4\n\nLimit Frobenius-Hodge structures\n\nWe conclude our description of degenerations in positive characteristic with a\nless formal discussion of the integral structure and Hodge filtration on our limiting Frobenius structures. Our hope is to convince the reader without detailed\nproofs that these additional structures exist and can be computed in quite wide\ngenerality.\nAssume that we have an algebraic number field L with ring of integers OL ,\nand a smooth and proper morphism XOL \u2192 SOL of OL -schemes, where SOL =\nSpec(AOL ) with AOL := OL [t, 1/\u2206(t)] for some \u2206(t) \u2208 OL [t]. We denote by\nXL \u2192 SL extension of scalars of XOL \u2192 SOL from OL to L. We follow our\nusual convention of using the subscript e to denote pulling-back along the base\nvia se := t. Theorem 2.4 guarantees the existence of e \u2265 1 and a basis for\nm\nHdR\n((XL )e /(SL )e ) such that the matrix for the Gauss-Manin connection w.r.t.\nthis basis has a simple pole at s = 0 with nilpotent residue matrix. To simplify\nnotation in our discussion let us suppose that e = 1, and write B for the basis.\n24\n\n\fLet p be a rational prime which is inert in OL , and X \u2192 S be the morphism\nm\nobtained by base change from OL to W . Denote by Hcris\n(X/S) relative crystalline cohomology. Write A := AOL \u2297OL W , let \u00c2 be the p-adic completion of\nA, and let A\u2020 be the weak completion of A (not tensored by K), see Section\nm\n3.1. We claim then that B maps naturally to a free \u00c2-basis Bcris for Hcris\n(X/S)\nprovided p is sufficiently large. We argue as follows.\nFor almost all such rational primes p one may canonically map B to a\nm\nsubset BdR of HdR\n(X/S) and provided p is sufficiently large (depending on\nm\nthe geometry of the morphism XL \u2192 SL ) then HdR\n(X/S) will be free with\nBdR as an A-basis. One expects a crystalline relative comparison theorem,\nm\nm\nHcris\n(X/S) \u223c\n(X/S) \u2297A \u00c2, although the author does not know of a ref= HdR\nm\nerence. Thus extending scalars BdR maps to an \u00c2-basis Bcris of Hcris\n(X/S).\nOne can make this construction of Bcris entirely explicit for families of smooth\nhypersurfaces using a relative version of the theorems and algorithms in [1].\nm\nWrite HW := Hcris\n(X/S) and denote by F the Frobenius on HW . The\n\u2022\ncohomology group HW inherits a filtration HW\nfrom the Hodge filtration on\nm\nHdR (X/S). Applying Mazur's \"Frobenius-Hodge theorem\" [23] fibre-by-fibre it\ni\ni\nfollows that F is \"divisible by pi \" on HW\n; that is, F(HW\n) \u2286 pi HW .\nAssume now that p is such that Bcris is a basis for HW . Let F (t)cris denote\nthe matrix for F w.r.t. the basis Bcris . Since Bcris is also naturally a basis for\nm\nHrig\n(X/S) the matrix F (t)cris has entries in A\u2020K \u2229 \u00c2 = A\u2020 . The connection\nmatrix N (t)cris has coefficients in AOL \u2282 A and a simple pole at t = 0 with\nnilpotent residue matrix. For all but finitely many primes N (t)cris will converge\non the punctured p-adic open unit disk around zero. Thus if we further exclude\nthis finite set of primes, the basis Bcris will satisfy the hypotheses of Definition\n3.4 and one can specialise at t = 0 to obtain a triple (H0 , N0 , F0 )W of a free W module H0 with operators N0 and F0 such that N0 F0 = pF0 N0 and N0m+1 = 0.\nMoreover, there is a natural filtration H0\u2022 such that F0 (H0i ) \u2286 pi H0 coming\nfrom the Hodge filtration on HW .\nAllowing once again e > 1 we have constructed the \"limiting FrobeniusHodge structure\" (H0\u2022 , N0 , F0 , e)W from Section 1. Note that when XL \u2192 SL\n\"extends\" to a semistable degeneration over the origin (cf. Definition 4.9) we\nhave e = 1, and the pair \"(H0\u2022 , N0 )W \u2297W C\" is exactly the limiting mixed Hodge\nstructure from complex algebraic geometry [28, Chapter 11].\nNote 3.17 The term \"limiting mixed Hodge structure\" arises naturally since\nthere is already the notion of a \"mixed Hodge structure\" and a \"Hodge structure\". In rigid or crystalline cohomology there is no formal notion of a \"Frobenius structure\" to the author's knowledge, although the term is used loosely,\ne.g. in \"differential equation with a Frobenius structure\". The object which we\ncall a \"limiting Frobenius structure\" might be better called a \"limiting mixed\nF -isocrystal\", and our \"limiting Frobenius-Hodge structure\" a \"limiting mixed\nHodge F -crystal\".\n\n25\n\n\f4\n\nDegenerations and \"Clemens-Schmidt\"\n\nThis section contains no original theorems, but rather gives a conjectural interpretation of the geometric significance of the limiting Frobenius structures we\ndefine. The notation in Sections 4.1, 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 mainly follows the original\nsources, and only in Section 4.2.3 do we return to the notation from Section 3.\n\n4.1\n\nComplex algebraic varieties\n\nThe material in this section is based upon the exposition in [26]. Throughout\nH m (\u2022) and Hm (\u2022) denote singular cohomology and homology, respectively, with\nrational coefficients\nLet \u2206 denote the complex open unit disk. A degeneration is a proper flat\nholomorphic map \u03c0 : X \u2192 \u2206 of relative dimension n such that Xt := \u03c0 \u22121 (t) is a\nsmooth complex variety for t 6= 0, and X is a Kahler manifold. A degeneration\nis semistable if the central fibre P\nX0 is a reduced divisor with global normal\ncrossings; that is, writing X0 = i X0,i as a sum of irreducible components,\neach X0,i is smooth and the X0,i meet transversally.\nWe recall a fundamental theorem on degenerations, due to D. Mumford with\nthe assistance of F. Knudsen and A. Waterman, see [26] or [25, Page 102].\nTheorem 4.1 (Semistable Reduction). Given a degeneration \u03c0 : X \u2192 \u2206 there\nexists a base change b : \u2206 \u2192 \u2206 (defined by t 7\u2192 te for some positive integer e),\na semistable degeneration \u03c8 : Y \u2192 \u2206 and a diagram\nY\n\nf\n\n99K Xb\n\n\u2212\u2192 X\n\n\u03c8\n\n\u0581\n\n\u2193\n\u2206\n\n\u2193\nb\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u2206\n\nsuch that f : Y 99K Xb is a bimeromorphic map obtained by blowing up and\nblowing down subvarieties of the central fibre.\nLet \u03c0 : X \u2192 \u2206 be a degeneration, and \u03c0 \u2217 : X \u2217 \u2192 \u2206\u2217 the restriction to the\npunctured disk \u2206\u2217 := \u2206\\{0}. Fix a smooth fibre Xt (t 6= 0). Since \u03c0 \u2217 is a C \u221e\nfibration, the fundamental group \u03c01 (\u2206\u2217 ) acts on the cohomology H m (Xt ), for\neach 0 \u2264 m \u2264 2n.

Assuming geometric semistable reduction (Conjecture 4.4),\nthe local monodromy representation on H m (X\u03b7\u0304 , Ql ) is quasi-unipotent.\nNote 4.7 Grothendieck proved that any l-adic representation of G is quasiunipotent, under a mild hypothesis on k [9, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 1.2]. In the case in\nwhich k is a finite field, this gives a proof of Corollary 4.6 which does not need\ngeometric semistable reduction.\nLet f : X \u2192 S be a semistable degeneration and \u03c1m the associated monodromy representation (7). There exists a homomorphism tl : I \u2192 Zl (1) and a\nunique nilpotent morphism\nNm : H m (X\u03b7\u0304 , Ql )(1) \u2192 H m (X\u03b7\u0304 , Ql )\n28\n\n\fsuch that\n\u03c1m (g) = exp(Nm tl (g)) for all g \u2208 I.\nAssume now that k is finite, and S is the henselisation of a closed point on a\nsmooth curve over k. (These conditions ensure in particular that the weightmonodromy conjecture holds true, see [9, Pages 41-42].) The following is the\nanalogue in l-adic \u00e9tale cohomology of one piece of the Clemens-Schmidt sequence.\nTheorem 4.8 (Local invariant cycle theorem).

See [2, 24] for some partial results for rigid\ncohomology (and the references therein for crystalline cohomology). By analogy\nthough the following suggests itself.\nLet X \u2192 S \u2286 A1Fq be a morphism of varieties over Fq which has a good\nlift around t = 0 (Definition 3.10). Then the limiting Frobenius structure\n(H0 , N0 , F0 , e) for X \u2192 S in dimension m around t = 0 exists and is unique\n(Theorem 3.8 and Lemma 3.6). We shall write (H0m , N0 , F0 , em ) when we wish\nto indicate the dependence of the limiting Frobenius structure on m.\nRecall here that S = Spec(W [t, 1/\u2206(t)]) for some polynomial \u2206(t) which has\nno zeros in K\u0304 within the punctured p-adic open unit disk around zero but may\nvanish at t = 0. It is interesting to note that if \u2206(0) = 0 mod p (that is, 0 6\u2208 S),\nthen we must have \u2206(0) = 0. (This follows by looking at Newton polygons since\n\u2206(t) is not identically zero modulo p (for otherwise S is empty) and therefore\n\u2206(t) contains a root in the p-adic open unit disk.)\nDefinition 4.9. Let X \u2192 S be any smooth morphism of varieties over Fq where\nS \u2286 A1Fq \\{0}. Let T := S \u222a {0} be the variety obtained by adjoining the origin\nto S. We shall say that X \u2192 S extends to a semistable degeneration over the\norigin if there exists a semistable degeneration Y \u2192 T which restricts to X \u2192 S\nover S.\nHere by \"semistable degeneration\" we mean in the sense of Section 4.2.1\nwhen one localises Y \u2192 T around the origin. In this situation we shall write\nX0 for the fibre of Y \u2192 T at the origin and refer to it as the degenerate fibre.\nNote X \u2192 S may extend to a semistable degeneration over the origin in more\nthan one way; for example, one can blow up smooth points on the degenerate\nfibre. Let us also define a semistable Fq -variety as one which is \u00e9tale locally\nisomorphic to Fq [t1 , * * * , tn ]/(t1 * * * tr ) for some n and r \u2264 n; so the degenerate\nfibre in a semistable degeneration is semistable.\nWe recall the definition of a basic object in rigid cohomology.\n\n29\n\n\fDefinition 4.10. An F -isocrystal M over K is a finite-dimensional K-vector\nspace equipped with an injective \u03c3-linear map F . For m \u2208 Z, define M (m) to be\nthe F -isocrystal with the same underlying vector space as M but with the action\nof F multiplied by p\u2212m .\nThe F -isocrystal which is associated to the limiting Frobenius structure\n(H0m , N0 , F0 , em ) is the pair (H0m , F0 ).\nDefine e := lcm0\u2264m\u22642n (em ) where n is the fibre dimension of X \u2192 S.\nOne may pull back the base Xe \u2192 Xem and the \"smallest\" limiting Frobenius\nstructure (H0m , N0 , F0 , em ) in dimension m is replaced by (H0m , (e/em )N0 , F0 , e).\nNote that this has no effect on the kernel and cokernel of the monodromy operator, since N0 is multiplied by a non-zero integer, i.e., there is no ambiguity in\nreplacing em by e.\nConjecture 4.11. Let X \u2192 S \u2286 A1Fq \\{0} be a morphism of varieties over Fq\nwhich has a good lift around t = 0 and denote by (H0m , N0 , F0 , em ) the limiting\nFrobenius structure at t = 0 in dimension m. Define e := lcm0\u2264m\u22642n (em ). Then\nthe morphism Xe \u2192 Se obtained by pulling back the base Se \u2192 S extends to a\nsemistable degeneration over the origin with degenerate fibre Xe,0 . Moreover,\nfor any such extension there exists a \"Clemens-Schmidt\" exact sequence of F isocrystals\nN\n\nm\n* * * \u2192 H2n+2\u2212m,rig (Xe,0 )(\u2212n \u2212 1) \u2192 Hrig\n(Xe,0 ) \u2192 H0m \u21920 H0m (\u22121)\nN\n\nm+2\n\u2192 H2n\u2212m,rig (Xe,0 )(\u2212n \u2212 1) \u2192 Hrig\n(Xe,0 ) \u2192 H0m+2 \u21920 H0m+2 (\u22121) \u2192 * * *\n\nfor some covariant \"rigid homology\" functor Hj,rig (\u2022) on semistable Fq -varieties\nwhich vanishes outside of dimensions 0 \u2264 j \u2264 2n.\nThe twistings here are chosen to be consistent with those on the filtered\nvector spaces [26, Page 108-109], and of course the equation N0 F0 = pF0 N0 .\nFor n = 1 and m odd our \"Clemens-Schmidt\" sequence is\nN\n\n1\n0 \u2192 Hrig\n(Xe,0 ) \u2192 H01 \u21920 H01 (\u22121) \u2192 H1,rig (Xe,0 )(\u22122) \u2192 0.\n\nThus according to Conjecture 4.11 the polynomial\nlogp (q)\n\ndet(1 \u2212 T F0\n\n|Ker(N0 ))\n\nis the numerator of the zeta function of the semistable curve Xe,0 . (The author\nis implicitly assuming here the existence of a trace formula for semistable curves,\ncf. (1).) One can test this for smooth plane curves by combining our algorithm\nfor computing limiting Frobenius structures of hypersurfaces with explicit ad\nhoc computations of \"stable limits\" of plane curves.\nFor n > 1 our \"Clemens-Schmidt\" sequence would involve in a non-trivial\nmanner the unknown \"rigid homology\" groups Hj,rig (Xe,0 ). It seems reasonable\nto conjecture though that the degenerate fibre Xe,0 arises by reduction modulo\n30\n\n\fp from a W -scheme Xe,0 and dropping the Frobenius structure we have an\nisomorphism of K-vector spaces\nHj,rig (Xe,0 ) \u223c\n= Hj ((Xe,0 )K ).\nwhere (Xe,0 )K is the generic fibre and Hj (\u2022) singular homology with coefficients\nin K. Thus under this further conjecture the dimensions at least of our unknown\nspaces are amenable to computation.\n\n5\n\nExamples\n\nIn this section we present some explicit examples of degenerations of curves,\nsurfaces and three-folds with the aim of illustrating our construction and providing evidence in support of Conjecture 4.11. We follow here the paradigm\nfrom experimental science rather than mathematics. That is, we test experimentally consequences of our conjecture and if there is no inconsistency declare\nwe have found evidence in support of it.\n\n5.1\n\nPreparation\n\nWe first discuss our choice of examples, and explain exactly what we computed\nin each case.\n5.1.1\n\nThe families\n\nIn our examples the family X \u2192 S is defined by an equation\nPt := (1 \u2212 t)P0 + tP1 = 0\n\n(8)\n\nfor specific choices of homogeneous polynomials P0 , P1 \u2208 Fp [x0 , * * * , xn+1 ]. We\nwrite the variables x0 , x1 , * * * , xn+1 as X, Y, Z and so on. The good algebraic\nlift XZ \u2192 SZ (Definition 3.14) of our family is defined by the same equation\nonly with the polynomials P0 and P1 thought of as having integer coefficients.\n(See the first paragraph of Section 3.3.1 for the exact construction of XZ \u2192 SZ\nfrom the polynomial Pt ; here we take \u2206(t) to be \u2206n,d (Pt ).)\nOur algorithm outputs a suitable approximation to the limiting Frobenius\nstructure (H0 , N0 , F0 , e) at t = 0 for the primitive middle dimensional cohomology of X \u2192 S, cf. Theorem 3.15. By suitable approximation we mean\nhere a pN -approximation for N sufficiently large in each example for the author\nto identify a plausible integer polynomial det(1 \u2212 T F0 |H0 ). We do not claim\nthis polynomial is provably correct; however, our choice of N is based upon expectations on the size of the coefficients from the weight-monodromy conjecture\n(Section 5.1.2) and consideration of the Zp -lattice structure and Hodge filtration\non the limiting Frobenius structure (Section 3.4 and [20, Section 9.3.2]).\n\n31\n\n\f5.1.2\n\nThe weight-monodromy conjecture\n\nThe nilpotent monodromy operator N0 defines an increasing filtration\n{0} =: (H0 )\u22121 \u2286 (H0 )0 \u2286 (H0 )1 \u2286 * * * \u2286 (H0 )2n := H0\non the Qp -vector space H0 [25, Pages 106-107]. The filtration is defined as\ni n+1\na \"convolution\" of the two filtrations (KerN0k )n+1\nk=0 and (ImN0 )i=0 [9, (1.5.5)].\nSince N0 F0 = pF0 N0 the filtration is therefore stabilised by the Frobenius F0 .\nIn the case of curves (n = 1) we have that N02 = 0 and the filtration is\n{0} \u2286 Im(N0 ) \u2286 Ker(N0 ) \u2286 H0 .\n\n(9)\n\nFor surfaces (n = 2) we have N03 = 0 and here the filtration is\n{0} \u2286 Im(N02 ) \u2286 Im(N0 )\u2229Ker(N0 ) \u2286 Im(N0 )+Ker(N0 ) \u2286 Ker(N02 ) \u2286 H0 . (10)\nNote that for surfaces when N02 = 0 then (10) becomes (9), only with indices\nshifted by one. In any dimension n we have N0n+1 = 0 (Theorem 4.2), but when\nin fact N0 = 0 then the filtration becomes\n(H0 )n\u22121 := {0} \u2286 H0 =: (H0 )n .\n\n(11)\n\nThese cases cover the ones we shall encounter in our examples.\nFor j such that 2j \u2208 Z and Q(T ) \u2208 1 + T Q[T ] we shall call Q(T ) a weight\nj Weil polynomial w.r.t. p if all of its reciprocal roots have complex absolute\nvalue pj . We shall say that the weight-monodromy conjecture holds for our\nconstruction if for each 0 \u2264 j \u2264 2n, we have det(1 \u2212 T F0 |(H0 )j /(H0 )j\u22121 ) a\nweight j/2 Weil polynomial w.r.t. p.\nFor each of our examples we state the dimensions of the subspaces in the\nmonodromy filtration, and we verified that the weight-monodromy conjecture\nholds for our construction. This gives evidence for the first part of Conjecture\n4.11, in the following slightly loose sense. If the morphism Xe \u2192 Se does\nextend to a semistable degeneration over the origin, then the weight-monodromy\nconjecture holds in the setting of l-adic \u00e9tale cohomology [9, Pages 41-42]. So\none at least expects that it should hold for our construction, although the author\ndoes not offer a proof of this.\n5.1.3\n\nStable limits of curves\n\nThe subspace (H0 )2n\u22121 in the filtration for curves (n = 1) is KerN0 . We write\ndown Q(T ) := det(1 \u2212 T F0 |KerN0 ) for our examples of curve degenerations.\nAccording to Conjecture 4.11 after pulling back se := t our degeneration should\nextend to a semistable degeneration over the origin with degenerate fibre the\ncurve Xe,0 and Q(T ) should be the numerator of the zeta function of Xe,0 . We\nprovide evidence in support of this in Section 5.2.1, using the recipes in [8] to\nconstruct at least geometrically the \"stable limits\" of our families at the origin.\nWriting X0 for the fibre at t = 0 in our original family, defined by the polynomial\n32\n\n\fP0 , it is amusing to note that Q(T ) can have nothing whatsoever to do with the\nzeta function of the singular fibre X0 itself.\nNote 5.1 In [16] Kloosterman gives an interesting discussion of the application\nof both the deformation method and Kedlaya's algorithm to singular projective\nhypersurfaces. Several low degree examples in which the cohomology is pure\n\"algebraic\" are presented. It is not clear to the present author that the methods\nbased on deformation in that paper can be generally applied; for example, the\nlift of Frobenius chosen may cause difficulties, cf. Note 3.3. However, the idea\nthat some appropriate version of the deformation method should compute the\nstable limit of a degeneration of curves is due to Kloosterman.\n5.1.4\n\nComments on implementation\n\nOur choice of examples was limited in several ways. First, it was convenient to\nassume that the degree d divides p \u2212 1 and take P1 := xd0 + * * * + xdn+1 , so that\nwe could easily write down the Frobenius matrix at t = 1 cf. [13, Section 1.5].\nSecond, we restricted attention mainly to examples in which the Picard-Fuchs\nmatrix w.r.t. the Dwork basis had only a simple pole at t = 0 (and converged\nin the punctured p-adic open unit disk). This avoided having to use a cyclic\nvector, which we found time consuming. See Example 5.8 for an exception.\nThird, for the quartic surface examples we chose polynomials P0 with few nonzero terms. This was a needed for the Gr\u00f6bner basis computation to finish\nwithin a reasonable time (see Note 2.9 for a method avoiding this). With these\nrestrictions we were still able to examine many different types of degenerations\n(some of which were suggested to the author by Damiano Testa).\nThe experiments were carried out using a machine with four quad-core processors (2.60 GHz) and 64 GB RAM. Approximate timings were: Example 5.2\n(1 minute), Example 5.3 (3 minutes), Example 5.4 (19 hours), Example 5.5 (4\nhours), Example 5.7 (44 hours), Example 5.8 (48 minutes), Example 5.9 (41\nminutes), Example 5.10 (1 minute), Example 5.11 (95 minutes), Example 5.12\n(2 hours), Example 5.13 (4 hours), Example 5.14 (11 hours) and Example 5.15\n(6 hours). Space consumption varied accordingly up to around 6 GB RAM.\n\n5.2\n\nThe experiments\n\nWe now present the results of our computational experiments.\n5.2.1\n\nExamples directly supporting Conjecture 4.11\n\nIn the following examples we were able to compute geometrically the stable limit\nof the degeneration and provide strong evidence supporting Conjecture 4.11.\nExample 5.2 Consider the degeneration (8) of a diagonal quartic curve to a\ndouble conic defined by taking P1 := X 4 + Y 4 + Z 4 and\nP0\n\n:=\n\n(X 2 + Y 2 + 3Z 2 + 3XY + Y Z + 2XZ)2 .\n33\n\n\fHere e = 2 and by pulling back the base via s2 := t we get monodromy operator N0 = 0. The monodromy filtration (9) has spaces of dimensions 0, 0, 6, 6,\nrespectively. For the prime p := 5 the reverse characteristic polynomial of the\nFrobenius F0 on Ker(N0 ) = H0 is\nQ(T ) = 1 \u2212 6T + 23T 2 \u2212 58T 3 + 115T 4 \u2212 150T 5 + 125T 6.\nThis is a weight 21 Weil polynomial w.r.t. 5. The zeta function of the fibre X0\nis 1/(1 \u2212 T )(1 \u2212 5T ) which is not related to the polynomial Q(T ). However, the\n\"stable limit\" X2,0 of the family around zero is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2\nwhich is constructed as a double-cover of the conic\nC := X 2 + Y 2 + 3Z 2 + 3XY + Y Z + 2XZ = 0\nramified at the eight points of intersection of C = 0 with P1 = 0 [8, Pages\n133-134]. By direct computation of these points and projection to an axis one\nfinds that over F5 the curve X2,0 has equation\ny 2 = a(x8 + 3x7 + 2x6 + 4x3 + x2 + 2x + 1)\nfor some non-zero a \u2208 F5 . Taking a to be a non-square in F5 gives a curve whose\nzeta function is indeed Q(T )/(1 \u2212 T )(1 \u2212 5T ). (For a a square the zeta function\nis Q(\u2212T )/(1 \u2212 T )(1 \u2212 5T ).) So this computation is consistent with Conjecture\n4.11.\nObserve that if we changed the polynomial P1 in Example 5.2 then the stable\nlimit of the degeneration would (usually) be different, since it depends upon the\npoints of intersection of P1 with the conic. Thus the stable limit can depend\nupon the family, not just the degenerate fibre.\nExample 5.3 Consider the degeneration (8) of a diagonal quartic curve to a\n3-cuspidal quartic (cusps (0 : 0 : 1), (0 : 1 : 0), (1 : 0 : 0)) defined by taking\nP1 := X 4 + Y 4 + Z 4 and\nP0\n\n:=\n\nX 2 Y 2 + Y 2 Z 2 + Z 2 X 2 \u2212 2XY Z(X + Y + Z).\n\nHere e = 6 and pulling back the base via s6 := t the local monodromy becomes\ntrivial; that is, N0 = 0. So as before the monodromy filtration (9) consists of\nspaces of dimensions 0, 0, 6, 6, respectively. For the prime p := 13 the reverse\ncharacteristic polynomial of the Frobenius F0 on Ker(N0 ) = H0 is\nQ(T ) = (1 \u2212 5T + 13T 2)3 .\nThis is a weight 12 Weil polynomial w.r.t. 13. The fibre X0 has geometric genus\nzero and zeta function 1/(1 \u2212 T )(1 \u2212 13T ). The \"stable limit\" around zero\nfor the family over C is a projective line P1C and three non-intersecting copies\nof an elliptic curve EC with j-invariant zero each meeting the projective line\ntransversely at one point; cf. [8, Pages 122-128], where the elaborate calculation\n34\n\n\fof the stable limit of a curve acquiring a cusp is performed. The polynomial\n1 \u2212 5T + 13T 2 is the numerator of the zeta function of an elliptic curve E :=\nE \u00d7Z F13 where EC := E \u00d7Z C has j-invariant zero, for E some elliptic curve\n\"over Z\" (indeed several). Thus this is consistent with Conjecture 4.11 taking\nX6,0 to be P1F13 \u222a E \u222a E \u222a E with appropriate intersections.\nExample 5.4 Consider the degeneration (8) of a diagonal quintic to a quintic\nwith a triple point (0 : 0 : 1) defined by taking P1 := X 5 + Y 5 + Z 5 and\nP0\n\n:= X 5 + Y 5 + (X 4 + 3X 3 Y + Y 4 )Z + (2X 3 + XY 2 + 3Y 3 )Z 2 .\n\nHere e = 3 and pulling back the base via s3 := t gives non-trivial nilpotent\nmonodromy N0 . We have N02 = 0 and the monodromy filtration (9) consists of\nspaces of dimensions 0, 2, 10, 12, respectively. For p := 11 the reverse characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius acting F0 acting on Ker(N0 ) is\nQ(T ) = (1\u2212T )(1+T )(1+11T 2)(1+5T +22T 2 +62T 3 +242T 4 +605T 5 +1331T 6).\nThe latter degree 8 factor is a weight 21 Weil polynomial w.r.t. 11. The \"stable\nlimit\" around zero for the family over C is the normalisation of the degenerate\nfibre meeting an elliptic curve with j-invariant zero at the three points lying over\nthe triple point of the degenerate fibre [8, Pages 131-132]. The degree six factor\nin Q(T ) is the numerator of the zeta function of the normalisation, and 1 + 11T 2\nthe numerator of the zeta function of E := E \u00d7Z F11 where EC := E \u00d7Z C has\nj-invariant zero, for E some elliptic curve \"over Z\". So this example supports\nConjecture 4.11.\nExample 5.5 Consider the degeneration (8) of a diagonal sextic to a sextic\ncurve with an ordinary double point (0 : 0 : 1) defined by taking P1 := X 6 +\nY 6 + Z 6 and\nP0\n\n:=\n\nX 6 + Y 6 + 3Y 4 Z 2 + 2X 3 Z 3 + (X 2 + Y 2 )Z 4 .\n\nHere e = 1, and no pullback on the base was required, but the monodromy\noperator N0 is non-zero. The monodromy filtration (9) consists of spaces of dimensions 0, 1, 19, 20, respectively. For the prime p := 7 the reverse characteristic\npolynomial of the Frobenius F0 acting on Ker(N0 ) is\nQ(T ) = (1 + T )(1 \u2212 T + 7T 2)(1 + T \u2212 9T 3 + 49T 5 + 343T 6)\n\u00d7(1 \u2212 4T + 19T 2 \u2212 60T 3 + 179T 4 \u2212 522T 5 + 1253T 6 \u2212 2940T 7 + 6517T 8\n\u22129604T 9 + 16807T 10).\nThe fibre X0 is semistable, and since the total space is smooth we have a\nsemistable degeneration. Indeed X1,0 := X0 has zeta function Q(T )/(1 \u2212 T )(1 \u2212\n7T ) as predicted by Conjecture 4.11.\n\n35\n\n\fNote 5.6 One can illustrate in a simple manner how our method can be used\nto compute the local factors at \"bad primes\" in the L-series of a curve using\nExample 5.5. Consider the plane curve over Z defined by the polynomial R0 :=\nP0 + 7Z 6 with P0 the polynomial from Example 5.5 but thought of as having\ninteger coefficients. Then this curve is smooth over Q but the reduction modulo\nthe prime p := 7 is the singular sextic X0 . The local factor at p := 7 in the\nL-series of the curve defined by R0 is Q(T ). Note here that one computes this\nlocal factor by lifting R0 mod 7 to the integer polynomial P0 , not the integer\npolynomial R0 itself. The reason for this is that the family over Q defined by\nthe equation (1 \u2212 t)R0 + tP1 is not smooth in the punctured p-adic open unit\ndisk around t = 0: since R0 defines a smooth curve over Q but R0 mod 7 defines\na singular curve over F7 this forces there to be a singular fibre in the family for\nsome t = t0 with ord7 (t0 ) > 0 (in fact, ord7 (t0 ) = 1 here).\nAlthough this example looks artificial, it is somewhat typical. Let R0 \u2208\nZ[X, Y, Z] be homogeneous of degree d defining a smooth curve over Q, but a\nsingular curve modulo some prime p. One expects this singular curve to have a\nsingle rational node, which after a linear change of variable is (0 : 0 : 1). So after\nthis change of variable R0 = P0 + p(aX + bY )Z d\u22121 + pcZ d for some a, b, c \u2208 Z\nand P0 (X, Y, Z) homogeneous of degree d with no term in Z d\u22121 or Z d . One\nexpects the curve defined by the polynomial P0 to have again just the single\nnode (0 : 0 : 1). One then computes the local factor at p using the lift P0 of\nR0 mod p as in Example 5.5.\nExample 5.7 Consider the smooth curve of genus 4 in P3 defined as the intersection\nT 2 + X2 + Y 2 + Z2 = 0\n3\n3\nT + 2T XZ + X \u2212 X 2 Y + Y 3 + Z 3 = 0.\nEliminating T we obtain a birational curve in P2 of degree 6 with 6 nodes,\ndefined by the polynomial\nP0 := X 6 \u2212 X 5 Y \u2212 2X 5 Z + 2X 4 Y 2 + 72 X 4 Z 2 + X 3 Y 3 \u2212 4X 3 Y 2 Z \u2212 3X 3 Z 3\n+ 21 X 2 Y 4 + 5X 2 Y 2 Z 2 \u2212 X 2 Y Z 3 + 27 X 2 Z 4 \u2212 2XY 4 Z \u2212 4XY 2 Z 3 \u2212 2XZ 5\n+Y 6 + 23 Y 4 Z 2 + Y 3 Z 3 + 23 Y 2 Z 4 + Z 6 .\nConsider now the degeneration (8) to this six-nodal sextic defined by taking\nP1 := X 6 + Y 6 + Z 6 . Here e = 1 and no pull-back on the base gives non-trivial\nnilpotent monodromy N0 . We have N02 = 0 and the monodromy filtration\nconsists (9) consists of spaces of dimensions 0, 6, 14, 20, respectively. For p := 7\nthe reverse characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius F0 acting on Ker(N0 ) is\nQ(T ) := (1 \u2212 T 2 + T 4 \u2212 T 6 )\n\u00d7(1 + 2T + 11T 2 + 40T 3 + 72T 4 + 280T 5 + 539T 6 + 686T 7 + 2401T 8).\nThe fibre X0 is semistable with smooth total space, so we have a semistable\ndegeneration. Indeed X1,0 := X0 has zeta function Q(T )/(1 \u2212 T )(1 \u2212 7T ),\n36\n\n\fwhich supports Conjecture 4.11. The zeta function of the original genus 4 curve\nin P3F7 has numerator the degree 8 weight 12 w.r.t. 7 factor of Q(T ).\n5.2.2\n\nExamples illustrating our construction\n\nThe next examples are primarily illustrative, although in each case we verified\nthe weight-monodromy conjecture held for our construction (Section 5.1.2). It\nwould be interesting to compute a \"semistable limit\" for the degeneration in each\ncase. Note that for the surfaces considered, cyclotomic factors in Q(T /p) should\ncorrespond to algebraic curves on the \"semistable limit\", by the philosophy of\nthe Tate conjecture if not the conjecture itself.\nExample 5.8 Consider the degeneration (8) of a diagonal quintic to a nonreduced union of lines defined by taking P1 := X 5 + Y 5 + Z 5 and\nP0\n\n:=\n\nXY Z 3 .\n\nHere e = 3 and pulling back the base via s3 := t gives non-trivial nilpotent\nmonodromy N0 . We have N02 = 0 and the monodromy filtration (9) consists\nof spaces of dimensions 0, 1, 11, 12, respectively. Note that in this example the\nconnection matrix had a double-pole at t = 0 w.r.t. the initial Dwork basis\n(see Corollary 2.8) and so a cyclic vector was used to obtain a new basis so\nthat the connection matrix had only a simple pole (cf. Theorem 2.1). For the\nprime p := 31 the reverse characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius F0 acting\non Ker(N0 ) is\nQ(T ) = (1 \u2212 T )(1 + 4T + 31T 2)(1 + 8T + 33T 2 + 248T 3 + 961T 4)2 .\nThe zeta function of the original singular fibre X0 is 1/(1 \u2212 31T )3.\nExample 5.9 Consider the degeneration (8) of a diagonal quartic surface to\na quartic surface with a pair of ordinary double points ((\u00b1i : 1 : 0 : 0) where\ni2 = \u22121) defined by taking P1 := X 4 + Y 4 + Z 4 + W 4 and\nP0\n\n:=\n\nX 4 + Y 4 + Z 4 + W 4 + 2X 2 Y 2 + 2XY ZW + 2ZW 3 .\n\nHere e = 2 and pulling back the base via s2 := t gives trivial monodromy;\nthat is, N0 = 0. The monodromy filtration (10) has subspaces of dimension\n0, 0, 0, 21, 21, 21. For the prime p := 5 the reverse characteristic polynomial\nQ(T ) of the Frobenius F0 on H0 satisfies\nQ(T /5) = (1 \u2212 T )7 (1 + T )6 (1 + T 2 )2 (1 + T + T 2 )(1 + 25 T + T 2 ).\nThe polynomial Q(T ) is a weight 1 Weil polynomial w.r.t. 5. By naive point\ncounting the author verified that mod T 8 the local expansion at T = 0 of the\nzeta function of the singular fibre X0 is congruent to (1 + 5T )2 times the local\nexpansion of 1/(1 \u2212 T )(1 \u2212 5T )Q(T )(1 \u2212 25T ). This suggests that a semistable\n37\n\n\fdegeneration can be constructed in which the degenerate fibre X2,0 is X0 blown\nup at the two singular points.\nExample 5.10 Consider the degeneration (8) of a diagonal quartic to a quartic\nsurface with a pair of A3 singularities ((0 : 0 : 0 : 1) and (\u22121 : 0 : 0 : 1)) defined\nby taking P1 := X 4 + Y 4 + Z 4 + W 4 and\nP0\n\n:=\n\nX 4 + Y 4 + 2Z 4 + W 2 (X 2 + Y 2 ) + 2W X 3 .\n\nHere e = 4 and pulling back the base via s4 := t gives trivial monodromy;\nthat is, N0 = 0.
