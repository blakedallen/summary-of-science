Assuming Standard Model\nproduction and decay, the available mass range has shrunk dramatically over just the past\nyear, with a favored region emerging between about 120 and 130 GeV, and hints of signals\nnear 125 GeV [1\u20133]. While this bodes well for the minimal Higgs scenario suggested by\nelectroweak precision and flavor observables, the story is of course far from over. Even if\nthe Higgs is ultimately found in this range, it will immediately come under very detailed\nscrutiny to verify that both its production and decay rates are indeed standard. Another\npossibility is that the Higgs, or one of its scalar cousins, is still hiding in the already excluded\nrange, but with smaller rate than the Standard Model prediction.\nWhile we continue to wait for a concrete result either way, we anticipate that the Higgs\nboson will be merely the first of many exciting discoveries at the LHC. In fact, the Higgs\nitself will continue to play a central role in the search for new physics by serving as a signal\nof the production of new particles, much like gauge bosons and fermions currently serve as\nsignals of the Higgs. Such new physics signals are of particular interest for illuminating the\nfull dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking, as new particles with large couplings to the\nHiggs may give us clues about the Higgs's origins. However, LHC searches for new sources of\nHiggs production can be nontrivial in practice, owing to the fact that Higgs decays usually\ninvolve jets. In particular, for new particles much heavier than the Higgs, this can lead to\ncomplications in standard object reconstructions \u2013 the jets and/or leptons from the Higgs\ndecay can become merged due to the small angles incurred by the large transverse Lorentz\nboost, forming a single \"Higgs-jet.\" Therefore, it behooves us to take a closer look at how\nthese signals might be uncovered.\nSince the Higgs boson has still not been conclusively seen, and since we do not even know\nif its properties are strictly those predicted by the Standard Model, any phenomenological\nstudy of boosted Higgses faces an immediate two-pronged question: What is the Higgs's\nmass and how does it decay? In previous publications [4, 5], a subset of the present authors\nexplored the possibility of a Standard Model Higgs near the LEP bound (mh \u2243 115 GeV),\n\nidentified via the decays h \u2192 bb\u0304 and h \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 . Utilizing the tools of jet substructure, as\n\nwell as some novel modifications to tau-tagging algorithms, we found that these dijet and\nditau systems could be effectively discriminated from QCD jets, even at pT 's well above\n1\n\n\f1 TeV and opening angles of O(0.1). We then applied these reconstruction techniques to the\nsearch for q q\u0304 \u2192 Z \u2032 \u2192 Zh, where the Z \u2032 is any new neutral spin-1 resonance with multi-TeV\nmass. We found sensitivity in a variety of different final-state channels up to Z \u2032 masses\nnear 3 TeV, assuming a 14 TeV LHC and O(100 fb\u22121 ) of luminosity. This mass is near the\nelectroweak precision lower bound often cited for warped extra dimension and composite\nHiggs models [6, 7], which had previously been estimated to be accessible for a light Higgs\nonly after ab\u22121 -scale luminosity upgrades [8].\nIn this paper, we extend those previous results to the much richer four-body decay modes\nh \u2192 W W (\u2217) /ZZ (\u2217) \u2192 4 fermions, which we call \"diboson-jets.\" We consider in detail the\ntwo cases of a 125 GeV Higgs decaying to W W \u2217 and a 200 GeV Higgs decaying to doublyresonant W W . With the current limits from the LHC, the latter becomes viable only\nif this \"Higgs\" has nonstandard couplings (e.g., fermiophobic), which would already be a\nstrong indication of additional TeV-scale physics. It can also be a neutral scalar not directly\nassociated with electroweak symmetry breaking, but which nonetheless decays like a heavy\nHiggs due to mixing [9]. For example, in the case of Z \u2032 models, it may be a scalar associated\nwith U(1)\u2032 breaking. Given that scalar \u2192 W W (\u2217) /ZZ (\u2217) decays can actually be rather\ngeneric, we expect that the techniques which we explore here will have wider applications.\nThe W W (\u2217) diboson-jets have the usual ensemble of secondary decay modes available to\nsystems with two W -bosons. Neglecting decays with taus for simplicity, these are dileptonic\n(W W (\u2217) \u2192 l\u03bdl\u03bd, BR = 5%), semileptonic (W W (\u2217) \u2192 l\u03bdq q\u0304 \u2032 , BR = 30%), and fully hadronic\n\n(W W (\u2217) \u2192 q q\u0304 \u2032q q\u0304 \u2032 , BR = 45%). In the dileptonic case, care must be taken in defining lepton\nisolation, but otherwise their identification is straightforward [10, 11]. In the semileptonic\nand fully hadronic cases, we get configurations that look qualitatively similar to QCD jets,\nand must apply dedicated jet substructure techniques to fully reconstruct the decay kinematics. These techniques allow us to establish that these jet-like systems in fact contain,\n\nrespectively, a lepton and a subjet doublet, or a quadruplet of subjets. In either case, the\ntotal (transverse) mass of the diboson-jet will be approximately mh , and we may be able\nto pick out one or more on-shell W subsystems. This level of detailed reconstruction can\nthen form the basis of dedicated semileptonic and fully hadronic diboson-jet tags, whose\nperformance we describe in more detail below.\nWith these substructure techniques in hand, we demonstrate their utility for new physics\nsearches by returning to the example of a multi-TeV Z \u2032 decaying into Zh. Such new res2\n\n\fonances are ubiquitous in models where the Higgs originates as a composite particle from\na new strongly-interacting sector, and these Z \u2032 decays can be dominated by Zh (and the\nSU(2)L -related mode W + W \u2212 ). (See, e.g., [8, 12].) The decay Z \u2032 \u2192 Zh also occurs with appreciable rate in simple U(1)\u2032 -extended gauge sectors, such as a TeV-scale hypercharge/B\u2212L\nadmixture or bosons from E6 unification (reviewed in [13]).\nWe conduct a broad multi-channel survey of discovery prospects for Z \u2032 \u2192 Zh \u2192\n\nZ(W W (\u2217) ) at the 14 TeV LHC, bringing together our diboson-jet tagging techniques and\nwell-known techniques for tagging boosted hadronic Z-bosons [14\u201321]. We find that channels incorporating hadronic decay modes and jet substructure are the most powerful, with\nmany different channels displaying similar performance. The most promising amongst these\nat masses above 3 TeV include the \"dijet with embedded lepton\" channel Zh \u2192 (q q\u0304)(l\u03bdq q\u0304 \u2032 )\n\n(previously studied in [8]), as well as the \"monojet\" channel (\u03bd \u03bd\u0304)(q q\u0304 \u2032 q q\u0304 \u2032 ). For masses below\nabout 2 TeV, the former remains powerful, and the channels (q q\u0304)(l\u03bdl\u03bd), (\u03bd \u03bd\u0304)(l\u03bdq q\u0304 \u2032 ), and\n(l+ l\u2212 )(l\u03bdq q\u0304 \u2032 ) also become comparable or better. Of course, in analogy to the ongoing Standard Model Higgs search itself, the answer to the question \"which channel is best?\" really\ndepends on the Z \u2032 mass range of interest and the available luminosity, and statistical combinations across channels can offer nontrivial benefits. We perform a simple estimate of such\na combination, and consider the discovery reach for a baseline set of Z \u2032 models. We find\nthat a 100 fb\u22121 run of the 14 TeV LHC has the potential to discover Z \u2032 \u2192 Zh \u2192 Z(W W (\u2217) )\nwith masses of up to 1.5\u20132.5 TeV in the case of a 125 GeV Higgs. For the 200 GeV Higgs,\nthe reach potentially increases to 2.5\u20133.0 TeV, though the actual reach inevitably depends\non the mechanism used to \"hide\" this Higgs from LHC searches.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we discuss techniques for tagging\nboosted hadronic and semileptonic diboson-jets. In Section III, we survey our studies of Z \u2032\ndiscovery prospects in a variety of different channels. We provide some closing comments in\nSection IV. Finally, we include two appendices. In Appendix A, we give a more complete\naccount of the technical details of our discovery estimates.

Identified\nsubjets are color-coded according to relative pT (in descending order: red, blue, green, yellow). The\nsemileptonic example includes a non-isolated muon (cyan). (Grey cells were thrown away by the\nsubstructure algorithm.)\n\nII.\n\nTAGGING DIBOSON-JETS\n\nIn this section, we outline some techniques for tagging highly Lorentz-boosted diboson\nsystems, generated in the decay of a boosted Higgs or other heavy scalar. We specialize\nto the case of h \u2192 W W (\u2217) , which is the dominant diboson decay mode of the Higgs. Our\n\napproach can be straightforwardly extended to ZZ (\u2217) , or generally any decay chain that\nleads to a four-body final state with any admixture of jets and leptons.\nWe first discuss the case of fully hadronic W W (\u2217) decay, and then semileptonic decay. We\nassume that the fully leptonic decay can largely be dealt with using standard lepton reconstruction, perhaps with somewhat loosened isolation criteria (as was explored for boosted\nleptonic Z bosons in [10, 11]). Examples of fully hadronic and semileptonic diboson-jets\nfrom boosted Higgs decay can be seen in Fig. 1. Note that these examples, with pT >\n\u223c 1 TeV\ncould easily fit inside of a standard-sized LHC jet (R \u2265 0.4).1\n1\n\nFor pT \u2243 1 TeV and mh \u2264 200 GeV, at least two fermions are merged at the \u2206R \u2264 0.4 level in essentially\n\n4\n\n\fTo study these decay modes under semi-realistic conditions, we turn photons and hadrons\ninto \"detector level\" objects in the form of calorimeter cells. The finite spatial resolution of\nthe calorimeter represents an obstacle to reliable jet substructure as we approach angular\nscales of O(0.1), exacerbated by the fact that a single particle will generally deposit energy\ninto a cluster of nearby cells rather than staying confined to a single cell. This tends to\nintroduce spurious substructure and to obscure any substructure that is actually present,\nespecially as the momentum scale exceeds a TeV. We use the present study as an opportunity\nto explore methods to undo this effect. In a typical LHC detector, the electromagnetic\ncalorimeter (ECAL) captures an O(1) fraction of the total jet energy, and traces its angular\ndistribution with O(0.02) resolution. This information can be combined with the hadronic\ncalorimeter (HCAL), which is spatially coarser but must be included for a complete energy\nmeasurement. We employ such a combination in the context of a highly simplified detector\nmodel. We defer a detailed discussion to Appendix B, but use the results of this approach\nthroughout the rest of the paper.\n\nA.\n\nFully Hadronic\n\nThe four-prong fully hadronic decay of W W (\u2217) can be dealt with much in analogy to twoprong and three-prong decays such as from boosted W /Z and h \u2192 bb\u0304 [14\u201322] or boosted\ntop quarks [17\u201319, 21, 23\u201326] (see also [27, 28]). Also, just as these previous techniques can\nbe generalized to other new physics searches (e.g., R-parity violating supersymmetry [29],\ncolored hadrons of a new confining sector [30]), a fully hadronic four-body diboson-tagger\nmay have other applications. A trivial extension automatically covered by the present study\nis boosted ZZ (\u2217) , but we can also contemplate scenarios such as boosted Higgs decays to\npseudoscalars h \u2192 aa \u2192 4g or 4b (also studied using substructure methods in [31, 32]), or\nany other multi-stage decay that ends in four quarks or gluons. For our purposes in this\npaper, we will simply consider the cases of a 125 GeV h \u2192 W W \u2217 or 200 GeV h \u2192 W W .\nWhile the rich substructure of four-prong decays should make their discrimination from\nevery event. The most widely separated fermions, on the other hand, can extend out to \u2206R \u223c 1: for the\n125 GeV (200 GeV) Higgs, \u2206Rmax \u2264 1.0 in 90% (75%) of events. Lower pT and/or higher-mass dibosonjets are broader. Below, we attempt to capture most of the decay products in a single large-radius jet that\ncovers about half of the detector. However, this approach ultimately becomes inefficient for pT <\n\u223c 300 GeV\n(500 GeV).\n\n5\n\n\fQCD-induced jets more straightforward than it is for two-prong or three-prong decays, we\nshould also bear in mind that the energy of the parent particle has to be distributed between\nmore objects. This often leads to a decay with a relatively soft parton and/or a parton that\nis somewhat widely separated in angle from the bulk of the jet activity. Consequently, while\nour first intuition may be to simply run two iterations of a two-body boosted object tagger,\nas is done for the Hopkins/CMS top-tagger [25, 33], we are often faced with situations where\nthe first iteration distributes the partons unequally between the first level of subjets (1+3\ninstead of 2+2), or where the softest and/or widest-angle parton is accidentally thrown away.\nTo implement our diboson-tagger, we instead work with a technique that borrows some\nideas from the three-body neutralino-tagger of [29]. (Ideas along the lines of the other\nmultibody substructure methods cited above would also be interesting to explore.) We\nfirst iteratively cluster the event into R = 1.5 quasi-hemispheric \"fat-jets\" with the Cambridge/Aachen clustering algorithm [34, 35], as implemented in FastJet [36]. After a fat-jet\nof interest is identified, we scan over its clustering history. Working backwards, this can be\nviewed as a tree-like structure consisting of a sequence of 1 \u2192 2 splittings. Each splitting\npresents us with two protojet branches j1 and j2 , with pT (j1 ) > pT (j2 ) by definition. We\ncharacterize all of the splittings with a fractional pT measure with respect to the original fatjet, pT (j2 )/pT (jfat ), and a mass-to-pT ratio of the softer branch, m(j2 )/pT (j2 ). If the former\nis smaller than a threshold \u03b4p = 0.03, or the latter is larger than a threshold \u03b4m/pT = 0.3, we\nlabel the splitting as \"soft.\"2 We also automatically label \"soft\" all splittings downstream\nof the j2 branch of a soft splitting. The remaining splittings we label \"hard.\" For these,\neach of the two branches carries an appreciable fraction of the jet pT , the softer branch is\nnot diffuse, and the splitting does not occur within a soft/diffuse branch. From amongst the\nhard splittings, we take the three with the largest mass, m(j1 + j2 ). Out of the six branches\nemanating from these three special splittings, there will always be exactly four branches\nthat do not contain any of the other splittings. We take these branches as our four subjets,\ndiscarding the rest of the particles that originally constituted the fat-jet.3\n2\n\n3\n\nThe m/pT cut serves to eliminate would-be subjets that are really just diffuse clouds of soft radiation.\nIt is somewhat similar to the mass-drop criterion of [16], but we find that it is more effective and less\nredundant with the pT asymmetry cut, at least in the context of Higgs bosons with TeV-scale momenta.\nIt is worth pointing out that this procedure can be generalized to arbitrary numbers of desired subjets,\nincluding two or three, by simply changing the number of massive, hard splittings requested. The twobody case essentially degenerates to [16], and the three-body case should overlap substantially with [29].\n\n6\n\n\fmh = 125 GeV\n\nmh = 200 GeV\n\nnormalized rate\n\nnormalized rate\n\n10-1\n\n10-2\n\n10-2\n\n-3\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n10-4\n\n40\n\n10-1\n\n10\n\n60\n\n80\n\n10-4\n\n100 120 140 160 180 200\n(GeV)\nmreco\nWW\n\n100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 280 300\n(GeV)\nmreco\nWW\n\nFIG. 2: Normalized distributions of reconstructed hadronic diboson mass, applying four-body substructure to 125 GeV (left) and 200 GeV (right) Higgs-jet candidates.

The remaining issue is to determine whether their\nmultibody kinematics look consistent with the partons from a W W (\u2217) decay. The kinematics\nwill clearly be different depending on whether we are below or above the W W threshold.\nFor the former, looking at the pair of subjets with the highest combined mass successfully\nreveals the on-shell W peak, whereas the W \u2217 does not yield a well-localized feature. For\nthe latter, the doubly-on-shell decay can be revealed by considering all partitionings of the\nsubjets into two pairs, and taking the partitioning that gives the smallest difference between\nthe masses of the pairs. The average of the two pair masses then typically comes out close\nto the W mass. Both reconstructions are illustrated in Fig. 3.\nQCD jets can sometimes fake these features through parton showering. In fact, jets that\nHigher numbers of subjets might be interesting to consider, for example, as a kind of alternative (and\nself-groomed) jet-finding algorithm that does not have a built-in minimum distance.

Generally speaking, gluon-jets have 2\u20133 times higher mistag rates than\nquark-jets, and HERWIG (angle-ordered) jets can have roughly 50% higher mistag rates than\nPYTHIA (virtuality-ordered) jets. Mistag rates for the 125 GeV h \u2192 W W \u2217 are about 2\u20133\ntimes bigger than for the 200 GeV h \u2192 W W . Removing the detector model and reverting to\nparticle level decreases mistag rates by about a factor of 2, mainly due to better resolution\non mmin\npair . Tag and mistag rates are both fairly stable versus pT .\n\nB.\n\nSemileptonic\n\nWhen a boosted W W (\u2217) pair decays semileptonically, we in principle get a much cleaner\ntag, assuming that we can reliably identify the lepton in the presence of nearby hadronic\nactivity. For 1 (3) TeV Z \u2032 decay into a Z and a 125 GeV Higgs, the lepton is more than\n\u2206R = 0.4 away from the accompanying jet activity in only 40% (5%) of events, so normal\nisolation-based lepton identification will often fail. The issue of lepton identification inside\nof a jet has been dealt with before in the context of semileptonic top-jets [24, 48\u201351]. There\nit has been pointed out that the high mass scale of the decay can be exploited to efficiently\nseparate out signal leptons from heavy flavor decays or fakes, even for very small \u2206R scales.\nThe separation appears to be good enough that, to first approximation, it is valid to ignore\nthese sources of background. In particular, [49, 51] showed that for dijet-like configurations\nwith a lepton near one of the jet axes, electroweak bremsstrahlung of a leptonic W was a\nmuch bigger worry than heavy flavor decays.\nThe main technique which we utilize for lepton identification is mini-isolation, introduced\n10\n\n\fin [49]. Real or fake leptons produced inside of very energetic jets are almost always accompanied by nearby showering and decay products. For the specific case of leptons from heavy\nflavor decay, the relevant \u2206R scale is set by the parent quark's mass-to-pT ratio. While\nthis can become quite small - much smaller than a standard lepton isolation cone - an\nisolation variable built using a miniature cone tailored to this \u2206R and tallying only tracks\nshould be quite robust for vetoing heavy flavor up to almost arbitrarily high energy.5 In\ncontrast, leptons produced from boosted top or Higgs decays have a much larger intrinsic\n\u2206R scale for the same pT , and are therefore fairly clear of extra radiation at the scale of the\nminiature cone associated with heavy flavor.\nMore explicitly, mini-isolation utilizes a cone that scales inversely with the lepton pT :\nRiso = (15 GeV)/pT (l). The pT of all tracks inside of this cone is scalar-summed, and the sum\nnot allowed to exceed 10% of the lepton pT . While the original version of mini-isolation was\napplied only to muons, subsequent experimental simulations have applied the same technique\nto electrons and found simliarly good performance [51]. Still, electron identification requires\nmuch more rigorous quality criteria, for example to discriminate against charged pions that\ndeposit a large fraction of their energy in the ECAL. We cannot properly reproduce these\nquality criteria in our own highly simplified analysis, but we do restrict the size of the miniisolation cone to be larger than 0.1 for electrons. This in principle gives enough space to\nproperly identify the electron track and its associated tracker/ECAL shower.6\nBesides the embedded lepton, semileptonic diboson-jets also have an additional layer of\nsubstructure that we can exploit, in the form of the accompanying subjet-doublet which we\nreveal through the \"mass drop\" algorithm introduced by Butterworth, Davison, Rubin, and\nSalam (BDRS) [16]. For partially off-shell decays, the subjets may have a mass near mW or\nmay occupy the continuum not far below mW . For double-on-shell decays, the subjets will\nalways have a mass near mW . In either case, both the cluster transverse mass of the l\u03bdq q\u0304 \u2032\nsystem and the total visible mass of the lq q\u0304 \u2032 system will be close to mh . This potentially\ngives us a lot of kinematic discrimination power against backgrounds.\nMore specifically, in cases where the diboson-jet recoils against visible activity (e.g.,\n5\n\n6\n\nBecause this form of isolation is based solely on tracks, it may also be less sensitive to pileup than\ncalorimeter-based isolation.\nWe do not attempt to impose \"isolation\" within the ECAL, which is also necessary for clean electron ID.\nHowever, tracker isolation is in any case highly correlated with electromagnetic isolation.\n\n11\n\n\fmh = 200 GeV\nnormalized rate\n\nnormalized rate\n\nmh = 125 GeV\n10-1\n\n10-2\n\n10-1\n\n10-2\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10-4\n\n10-4\n\n-3\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n20\n\n-5\n\n40\n\n60\n\n10\n\n80 100 120 140 160 180 200\nmreco\nWW (GeV)\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n300\nmreco\nWW (GeV)\n\nFIG. 5: Normalized distributions of reconstructed diboson-jet mass distributions, applying semileptonic substructure to 125 GeV (left) and 200 GeV (right) Higgs-jet candidates.

Here, we take a somewhat more minimalistic approach\nby simply setting the rapidity of the neutrino to match that of the four-vector sum of\nthe lepton and the two subjets. Given the possible uncertainties in determining the exact\npointing of the 6ET vector, and the high sensitivity of our reconstruction to even O(0.1) errors\nin angle, we also conservatively align the neutrino with the lepton+subjets in \u03c6. We can\nthen take the invariant mass of this system as a proxy for the diboson candidate mass. The\nresult of this procedure is illustrated in Fig. 5, which displays a clear peak near mh . In cases\nwhere the diboson-jet recoils against a system with additional neutrinos (such as Z \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304),\nthe 6ET no longer gives us a clear indication of the pT of the neutrino in the W W (\u2217) decay,\n\nand we must resort instead to the visible mass.

We focus on the case of a narrow TeV-scale Z \u2032\nproduced in q q\u0304 annihilation, and assume mh = 125 GeV or 200 GeV. We derive estimates\nof discovery sensitivity at the 14 TeV LHC, which can have appreciable Z \u2032 production cross\nsections at truly multi-TeV masses, generating boosted Higgses with momenta in excess of\na TeV. We reserve an investigation of sensitivity/exclusion at the 7 or 8 TeV LHC for future\n\n14\n\n\fwork.7\nSince we are ultimately dealing with a triboson signal, we face a large number of possible\nfinal states in which we can run a search. To initially reduce the number of options, we\nneglect channels with tau-leptons. But this still leaves us with nine possibilities, spanning a\nlarge range of branching fractions. The situation is illustrated in Table V. As usual, channels\nwith small branching fractions are typically cleaner because they have more leptonic activity.\nHowever, even a channel with little background loses its utility if the total number of signal\nevents is unobservably small. Also, given the jet substructure tools outlined in the previous\nsection, the benefits of trading off a quark for a lepton are not always as dramatic as we\nmight first guess.\nOur approach here will be to simply run a survey over most of the channels. The one\nnotable exception is the fully hadronic channel Zh \u2192 (q q\u0304)(q q\u0304 \u2032q q\u0304 \u2032 ), which faces a substantial\nbackground from dijet QCD and top pairs, even after exploiting the potential quintuplyresonant structure of the signal. (Although for very high-mass searches, where the backgrounds have fallen off, this may nonetheless become competitive.) This leaves us with eight\nexclusive channels, with varying degrees of leptonic, hadronic, and invisible activity.\nFor each of these eight channels, we simulate the signal and the most important backgrounds using leading-order matrix-elements in MadGraph or PYTHIA, supplemented with the\nleading-log virtuality-ordered parton shower in PYTHIA. We subsequently pass the events\nthrough the simple calorimeter model described in Appendix B. We then cluster the event\ninto quasi-hemispheric fat-jets of R = 1.5, and decluster these as either Z-jets or dibosonjets. The physics simulations and reconstructed object definitions are described in more\ndetail in Appendix A.\nThe different channels face different issues related to energy/mass resolution and kinematic ambiguities, owing to different numbers of leptons versus jets and different numbers\nof neutrinos. In cases where the Z decays invisibly and/or the W W (\u2217) system decays semiinvisibly, we default to a minimalistic reconstruction of a single effective neutrino: the\nmissing energy vector serves as the transverse momentum vector of the neutrino, and the\nneutrino's rapidity is set equal to that of the subsystem composed of the visible W W (\u2217)\n7\n\nIn particular, this may serve as an interesting context in which to find the Higgs in the first place (or\nother exotic scalars), especially if it is nonstandard. However, this possibility must be carefully studied\nincorporating constraints from existing Higgs and new physics searches.\n\n15\n\n\farbitrary units\n\narbitrary units\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n2500\n(GeV)\nmreco\nZ'\n\n1600\n\n1800\n\n2000\n\n2200\n2400\n(GeV)\nmreco\nZ'\n\nFIG. 6: Reconstructed Z \u2032 lineshapes for a 125 GeV Higgs and mZ \u2032 = 2 TeV in all eight of our\nanalysis channels.

We then (semi-)reconstruct the event mass by\nadding all visible products and this effective neutrino. In channels with a visible Z decay,\nknowing the exact kinematics of the neutrinos is not so crucial for reconstructing the global\nmass of the event, and it is largely adequate to know the summed invisible p~T and approximate summed pz . In cases with an invisible Z decay, we face an inevitable degradation of\nZ \u2032 mass reconstruction, which gets worse as the W W (\u2217) system becomes more invisible.8\nWe illustrate the quality of our Z \u2032 mass reconstruction in all eight of our search channels in\nFig. 6.\nWe structure all of our searches using a simple \"cut and count\" approach. Details of the\ncuts vary from channel-to-channel, but a handful of common requirements can be identified:\n\u2022 A tagged diboson-jet recoiling against either a tagged hadronic Z-jet, a leptonic Z, or\n8\n\nHowever, it is worth pointing out that a Z \u2032 produced in q q\u0304 annihilation is polarized along the beam, and\nis forbidden to decay back down to a scalar plus (longitudinal) gauge boson along the beamline. This\nleads to a bias for central production, and more of the event's energy going transverse. Consequently, the\ndegrading effect on the peak can be less of an issue than it is for, say, the transverse mass distribution of\nsingly-produced leptonic W bosons.\n\n16\n\n\fsubstantial 6ET .\n\u2022 A sizeable ratio between the pT of each side of the event to the reconstructed Z \u2032 mass.\n\u2022 A reconstructed Z \u2032 mass localized in a window centered on the signal.\nThe second requirement only applies to cases where the Z is visible. It removes regions of\n\u221a\nphase space with high- \u015d but low-pT , characteristic of many QCD-induced processes with\nt-channel singularities. Usually, after the first two requirements, the signal appears as a\nlocalized excess on top of a smoothly-falling background distribution of reconstructed event\nmass.\nAfter defining our search regions, we characterize the expected significance of the signal\n\u221a\nby taking the common S/ B approximation, and determine the signal cross section required\nto achieve 5\u03c3. Since this becomes a very poor approximation for O(1) number of events,\nand since even nearly-vanishing physics backgrounds may in reality be supplemented by\ninstrumental backgrounds, we introduce a statistical \"regulator\" by enforcing a floor of\nB = 4 events in each channel. This means, for example, that even for channels with\nessentially zero expected background events according to our simple estimates, we require\nat least 10 signal events to claim 5\u03c3 significance.\nWhile sometimes one channel may clearly dominate the discovery reach, there is often\nmuch to be gained by forming a statistical combination. This is especially true for the\npresent situation, where the full signal appears distributed across a large number of exclusive\nanalyses. We perform our combination by forming a summed event count, with each channel\nweighted by S/B. The final result is equivalent to adding together the significance of all\nchannels in quadrature.\nWe present our final search reach estimates in Figs. 7 and 8 for the 125 GeV and 200 GeV\nHiggs, respectively.

However, we can infer some general\nfeatures regarding how the channels compare with one another given on our own set of\nchoices. Channels with large numbers of leptons, such as the four-lepton Zh \u2192 (l+ l\u2212 )(l\u03bdl\u03bd),\nhave very little background but are so rate-limited that they cannot compete at high masses.\nIndeed, it is the mostly-hadronic modes (q q\u0304)(l\u03bdq q\u0304 \u2032 ) and (\u03bd \u03bd\u0304)(q q\u0304 \u2032 q q\u0304 \u2032 ) that dominate the search\nreach above 3 TeV for 100 fb\u22121 . This is greatly facilitated by the jet substructure methods\nwhich we have applied (hadronic Z-tag, semileptonic and hadronic diboson-tags), which\nheavily suppress the otherwise sizeable backgrounds.10 At masses below 3 TeV, the situation\nis more mixed, but we find that leaders are (q q\u0304)(l\u03bdq q\u0304 \u2032 ), (q q\u0304)(l\u03bdl\u03bd), and (\u03bd \u03bd\u0304)(l\u03bdq q\u0304). Below\nabout 1.2 TeV, (l+ l\u2212 )(l\u03bdq q\u0304 \u2032 ) becomes dominant. Each of these channels benefits in some way\n10\n\nThe channel Zh \u2192 (q q\u0304)(l\u03bdq q\u0304 \u2032 ) was considered before in [8], which found similar model reach at high\nmass without application of jet substructure techniques. We note that those results capitalized on very\nstrict kinematic cuts without application of showering or energy resolution effects, and did not include top\nbackgrounds. Still, the question of how to best trade off between substructure cuts and more traditional\nkinematic cuts remains a nontrivial one.\n\n18\n\n\fS\u0090B = 1, mh = 200 GeV\n\u03a3Hpp\u00aeZ'L  \u0301 BRHZ'\u00aeZhL HfbL\n\n\u03a3Hpp\u00aeZ'L  \u0301 BRHZ'\u00aeZhL HfbL\n\nDiscovery reach, mh = 200 GeV\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n3.5\nMZ' HTeVL\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n3.5\nMZ' HTeVL\n\nFIG. 8: Discovery reach with 100 fb\u22121 (left) and \u03c3 \u00d7 BR at which S/B = 1 (right), for a 200 GeV\nHiggs.

Still, it is interesting that jet substructure makes so many of these channels\ncompetitive, whereas a more conservative approach might discard many of the hadronic\noptions in favor of modes with more leptons.\nIn Fig. 9, we show how the discovery reach evolves with luminosity, picking either the\nbest channel for a given mass point or performing the combination of channels. We also\nshow four baseline models with sizeable \u03c3 \u00d7 BR into Zh: a sequential Z \u2032 , the warped KK\nZ \u2032 bosons of [6], the \u03b7 boson of the E6 unified model, and the TR3 boson of a left-right\nsymmetric model with SU(2)R \u2192 U(1) broken at a high scale (reviewed in [13]).11 (The\n11\n\nWe define the Z \u2032 -Higgs couplings in the sequential Z \u2032 model by replacing Z\u03bc \u2192 Z\u03bc + (mZ /mZ \u2032 )2 Z\u03bc\u2032 in\nall Z-Higgs couplings. This yields BR(Z \u2032 \u2192 Zh) \u2243 3%, which is comparable to the BR into electrons\n(or muons). The warped KK Z \u2032 is a set of three neutral bosons with variable BRs to Zh, described in\ndetail in [8].

The displayed luminosities are\n10 fb\u22121 (blue), 100 fb\u22121 (purple), and 1000 fb\u22121 (dark yellow). Solid lines are a simple statistical\ncombination of all modes, and dashed lines are the best individual mode for a given Z \u2032 mass. Models\nare indicated by short-dashed lines, and include a Z-sequential boson (green), the warped KK Z \u2032\nbosons of [6] (black), and either the \u03b7 boson of E6 or a TR3 gauge boson (red).\n\nlast two have rates that are within 10% of one another, and they are represented by a\nsingle line.) Many of these models have roughly democratic couplings to Standard Model\nfermions and to the Higgs doublet, whereas the KK bosons have small couplings to the\nformer interplaying with large couplings to the latter. For the 200 GeV Higgs, which is\nexcluded if it has Standard Model-like couplings [1, 2], we can instead take as a baseline a\nfermiophobic Higgs (as in, e.g., [55]) with the same U(1)\u2032 charge as its SM-like counterpart.\nWhile there are many ways to hide the Higgs boson, this assumption keeps BR(Z \u2032 \u2192 Zh)\nand BR(h \u2192 W W ) largely unchanged, and allows the simplest comparison to the 125 GeV\nanalysis. Still, any realistic fermiophobic model would also require an additional source\nof electroweak symmetry breaking to give mass to the top quark and other fermions, and\nconsequently there will be some degree of suppression of Z \u2032 \u2192 Zh since the fermiophobic\n(4.5%). Dilepton resonance searches at the LHC constrain the sequential, E6 , and TR3 bosons to be above\nabout 2 TeV [53, 54]. Electroweak precision constraints suggest that the KK, E6 , and TR3 bosons are\nheavier than about 3 TeV.\n\n20\n\n\fHiggs cannot saturate EWSB.\nWithin the context of this diverse handful of Z \u2032 models, we see that the 14 TeV LHC has\ngood discovery prospects for masses well above a TeV. Even for the 125 GeV case, where the\nW W \u2217 decay mode is subleading, models with masses in the 1.5\u20132.5 TeV range are visible\nwith O(100 fb\u22121 ) luminosity. For the 200 GeV case, the mass reach potentially goes up to\nabout 2.5\u20133.0 TeV, modulo the necessity of additional model-dependence to hide the Higgs\nfrom direct searches. We have also indicated what might be achieved with a 1000 fb\u22121\nluminosity upgrade: 3 TeV or higher mass reach for the 125 GeV Higgs, and better than\n3.5 TeV mass reach for the 200 GeV Higgs.\nIf the Higgs indeed resides at 125 GeV, and is largely standard in its couplings, then the\nh \u2192 W W \u2217 decay rate is smaller than bb\u0304 by about a factor of 3. The study of [4] suggests\nthat a search for Z \u2032 \u2192 Zh \u2192 Z(bb\u0304) would be more sensitive, typically by an O(1) factor in\n\u03c3 \u00d7 BR. (The comparison is nontrivial, as the present diboson study can utilize the Z \u2192 q q\u0304\ndecays, whereas if the Higgs also decays to jets, even b-jets, the corresponding channels are\nprobably highly background-contaminated.) Nonetheless, even if these estimates are correct,\na corroborating observation of Z \u2032 \u2192 Zh \u2192 Z(W W \u2217) would be extremely useful. It would\nnot only serve to verify the existence of the Z \u2032 , but would improve confidence that the bb\u0304\nresonance into which it decays is really the Higgs. Our present results suggest that this is\nnot only possible, but that both discoveries may occur on a similar timescale. Of course,\nthere is still a chance that Nature will surprise us, either by yielding up a Higgs which is\nactually dominated by W W (\u2217) , or by providing additional scalar states with diboson decay\nmodes.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have considered how to discriminate boosted W W (\u2217) /ZZ (\u2217) \"dibosonjet\" systems utilizing jet substructure techniques, focusing on the cases of h \u2192 W W \u2217 for\na 125 GeV Higgs and h \u2192 W W for a 200 GeV Higgs. For fully hadronic decays, we\ndemonstrated the feasibility of a dedicated tagger by identifying the hardest splittings in\nthe diboson-jet, filtering out diffuse radiation, and exploiting the kinematic distributions\nof the resulting four hard subjets. For tag rates of approximately 50%, we achieve mistag\nrates between 0.5\u20135%. For semileptonic decays, we showed that mini-isolation and two21\n\n\fbody hadronic substructure could be combined to powerfully reject QCD jets with embedded\nleptons from heavy flavor decays, as well as jets with W -strahlung emission and semileptonic\ntop-jets. Again working at 50% tag rate, we reject the former at the 10\u22124 level, and find\nO(5%) mistags for jets with real W s. For both W W (\u2217) decay modes, in order to keep the\ntag/mistag rates stable as we exceed pT \u2243 TeV, and as the angular scales shrink to the size\nof individual hadronic calorimeter elements, we have investigated the possibility of a novel\nECAL/HCAL hybridization.\nAs a simple application of these diboson-jet taggers, we have outlined searches for a\nTeV scale Z \u2032 \u2192 Zh resonance at the 14 TeV LHC using the various Z(W W (\u2217) ) finalstate channels. We found that channels with one or more hadronic W and/or Z decays\nare more sensitive than the exclusively leptonic channels. In particular, the leaders are\nZh \u2192 (q q\u0304)(l\u03bdq q\u0304 \u2032 ), (\u03bd \u03bd\u0304)(l\u03bdq q\u0304 \u2032 ), (\u03bd \u03bd\u0304)(q q\u0304 \u2032 q q\u0304 \u2032 ), (q q\u0304)(l\u03bdl\u03bd), and, at masses below about a TeV,\n(l+ l\u2212 )(l\u03bdq q\u0304 \u2032 ). Only one of these channels uses the rare but highly distinctive fully leptonic\n\nW W (\u2217) \u2192 (l\u03bdl\u03bd) decay, and, as we scan up in Z \u2032 masses, ultimately runs out of statistics\nfaster than channels that capitalize on fully hadronic or semileptonic diboson-jet tagging.\nTaken together, our results suggest that resonances in the truly multi-TeV mass range\nshould be discoverable via the diboson decay modes of the Higgs, and that searches for these\nresonances would be substantially facilitated and expanded by jet substructure techniques.\nWhile this demonstrates the long-term LHC reach using extremely collimated diboson\nsystems, we emphasize that our techniques become useful even at momenta only a few times\nhigher than the Higgs mass itself, which may be accessible to the current 7 and 8 TeV LHC.\nUnderstanding Z \u2032 sensitivity at these energies, or even the prospects for first discovery of a\nnonstandard Higgs in Z \u2032 decay, is an interesting open topic.\nAlthough we have exclusively studied the specific decay sequence Z \u2032 \u2192 Zh \u2192 Z(W W (\u2217) )\nfor simplicity, we note that many of the same techniques will also apply to W \u2032 \u2192 W h \u2192\n\nW (W W (\u2217) ), as well as to the subdominant Higgs decay mode h \u2192 ZZ (\u2217) . The latter case in\n\nparticular was considered in the six-lepton final state in [56], albeit with very limited reach\nin Z \u2032 mass due to the very small total branching fraction. Adding in modes with partial\nor fully hadronic decays of the boosted ZZ (\u2217) system is a straightforward generalization\nof our treatment of W W (\u2217) , and indeed the latter would be picked up for free anyway.\n(This would increase statistics for our 125 GeV and 200 GeV analyses by about 10% and\n30%, respectively, though we did not explicitly include them.) Incorporating the ZZ (\u2217) \u2192\n22\n\n\fl+ l\u2212 q q\u0304 modes could offer some interesting supplementary search channels, such as Zh \u2192\nZ(ZZ (\u2217) ) \u2192 (q q\u0304)(l+ l\u2212 q q\u0304), which has similar topology to Zh \u2192 Z(W W (\u2217) ) \u2192 (q q\u0304)(l\u03bdq q\u0304 \u2032 ).\n\nStill, the small total rates make these modes less attractive for a multi-TeV resonance search,\nwhere statistics is a major limiting factor.\nDiboson-jet tagging can have a wider application beyond searches involving boosted Higgses. Indeed, if the Higgs is near 125 GeV, as suggested by the LHC data, then our Z \u2032 search\ncould also be accomplished using the dominant Higgs decay mode h \u2192 bb\u0304 [4] (or the subdominant but highly distinctive ditau mode [5]). However, many models of new physics also\npredict scalars beyond the Higgs, which can dominantly decay into W W (\u2217) through mixing\n[9]. A particularly relevant example in the context of renormalizable Z \u2032 models would be the\nHiggs(es) of the U(1)\u2032 sector. Other types of boosted multi-jet cascades from new physics\ncan also benefit from our treatment, even if the intermediate state is not W W (\u2217) /ZZ (\u2217) .\nThere are also many other ways to produce boosted Higgses, such as in heavy top partner\ndecays or due to strong EWSB effects in weak boson scattering [57]. Having diboson-jet\ntagging available as a tool for identifying these processes could greatly improve sensitivity,\nespecially in final states with multiple boosted Higgses where we can include both bb\u0304 and\nW W \u2217 decay modes.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to Andrey Katz for collaboration in the early phase of this work.

For background\nsamples, we use MadGraph5 v1.3.30 [52]. All processes are evaluated at leading order,\n\n23\n\n\fand without pileup.12 We do not attempt to use matrix elements to model the multibody\ndistribution of partons inside a jet, except in cases involving a heavy particle decay (such\nas a top quark). So, for example, for a QCD jet faking a hadronic diboson-jet, the jet\nis generated by a single hard parton, and its substructure is generated entirely by parton\nshowering. As noted in Section II, there is sensitivity to the exact showering model when\ndealing with hadronic substructure. In such cases we have erred on the conservative side by\nrescaling the background rate to match what would be expected from the HERWIG shower.\nWe pass the showered and hadronized samples through the detector simulation described\nin Appendix B, and proceed to reconstruct jets, leptons and 6ET . Finally, we apply substructure methods and analysis cuts.\np\nFor leptons, we smear the energies by 2% for electrons and by (5%)\u00d7 E/TeV for muons.\nSubsequently, we only consider leptons with pT > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. We make a first\npass over the event, searching for electrons and muons which are isolated in a traditional\nsense: scalar-summing the pT of all photons and hadrons within an \u03b7\u2013\u03c6 cone of R = 0.4\naround the lepton, pT (l)/(pT (l) + pT (cone)) > 0.9. (Note that we do not include other\nnearby leptons in the cone.) Amongst these, any opposite-sign same-flavor pairs with a\nmass m(l+ l\u2212 ) = [81, 101] GeV are added together and treated as leptonic Z bosons. If, after\nZ boson clustering, there are no other isolated leptons in the event, then we check whether\nthere are any non-isolated leptons, and keep the hardest one if it is mini-isolated as defined\nin Section II B. All remaining leptons are considered \"hadrons\" for jet clustering, below.\nWe then cluster all calorimeter cells (and non-isolated leptons) into jets using the Cambridge/Aachen algorithm with R = 1.5, as implemented in FastJet v2.4.2 [36]. These\nquasi-hemispheric fat-jets serve as the input into our jet substructure algorithms. We only\nconsider events where the highest-pT fat-jet has |\u03b7| < 1.5. In events with no reconstructed\nleptons (but possibly a leptonic Z), we decluster the hardest jet using the four-body hadronic\ndiboson-tagger and require that it pass all of our internal phase space cuts on the four-subjet\nmass and subjet pairwise masses described in Section II A. All other jets we decluster into\n12\n\nIn our previous paper [4], we found that the effects of pileup were easily controllable. For the present paper,\nwe have also studied the application of trimming [20]. We assume that most charged pileup particles can\nbe eliminated by vertexing, leaving over only photons and neutral hadrons. If we subsequently trim each\nevent by pre-clustering into R = 0.2 anti-kT jets [58] and throwing away jets with pT < a few GeV, then\nwe find that the influence of pileup on our reconstructions is largely eliminated.\n\n24\n\n\ftwo subjets with the BDRS mass-drop method [16]. We fractionally smear all subjet energies\np\nby 5 (GeV/pT ) \u2295 0.5 GeV/pT \u2295 0.04.\nWe reconstruct 6ET by balancing the ~pT of all leptons and the subjets from the leading\ntwo decomposed fat-jets.\nThe final analysis channel of an event depends on a small set of baseline criteria applied\nto the subjets, leptons, and 6ET . In all cases with one lepton, we attempt to match it with the\nhardest subjet-pair within \u2206R < 1.5 to form a semi-leptonic diboson candidate. We then\nclassify the event based on the activity on the opposite side of the detector (\u2206\u03c6 > \u03c0/2 away\nfrom the vector-summed subjets and lepton): a leptonic Z, a Z-candidate subjet-pair with\nm = [76, 106] GeV, or substantial 6ET . (A jet is only considered as a hadronic Z-candidate if\nit is also the hardest jet in the event.) If the recoiling Z is visible, we apply the semileptonic\ndiboson-tag incorporating the lepton's sister neutrino, whereas if the Z is invisible we only\nutilize the lepton and matched subjets. The full semileptonic tag criteria are described in\nSection II B. In cases with two leptons, which serve as dileptonic diboson candidates, we\nrequire that the leptons be within \u2206R < 1.5 of one another. Again, we determine the final\nchannel by checking whether the opposite side of the detector is consistent with leptonic\nZ, hadronic Z, or invisible Z. Finally, if there is no lepton, then the hardest jet should\nbe a hadronic diboson candidate, and we only consider cases where it is associated with a\nleptonic Z or 6ET comparable to the jet pT . This defines our eight analysis channels.\n\nAll channels under consideration, except for hadronic W W (\u2217) with leptonic Z, contain\n\nneutrinos. In such cases, in order to facilitate approximate Higgs and Z \u2032 reconstruction, we\ndefine a single effective neutrino by using the 6ET vector as the neutrino's pT vector. We then\nset the neutrino's rapidity equal to that of the visible diboson decay products. In general,\nthe reconstructed Z \u2032 mass, mreco\nZ \u2032 , is defined as the invariant mass of the four-vector sum\nof the visible diboson decay products, visible Z decay products (if any), and the effective\nneutrino.\nWe subsequently apply cuts to define a signal region, and determine the efficiency for\nthe signal and the cross section for each background.13 The cuts are given in Tables VI\n13\n\nWhen defining signal efficiencies, we do not allow cross-talk between the different decay channels and their\ncorresponding search channels. For example, decays involving taus can also produce (mini-)isolated leptons, and can sometimes get picked up by one of our leptonic search channels. However, when determining\nthe efficiency for a given leptonic channel, we do not include signal events with taus.\n\n25\n\n\fthrough VIII. We note that none of these cuts has been rigorously optimized in the sense of\na computer scan, but they have all simply been tuned by eye to reject as much background\nas possible while keeping O(1) signal efficiency.\nOur final results appear in Tables IX through XVI.14 We determine the signal efficiencies\nand background cross sections for a trial set of Z \u2032 masses: 1, 2, and 3 TeV. (Many of the\nbackgrounds that we checked are subleading, in the sense that together they add up to only\nO(10%) or less of the total. For brevity, we do not explicitly list their cross sections.) We\nextend these results to arbitrary Z \u2032 masses by quadratic interpolation of the signal efficiencies\nand of the logarithms of the individual background cross sections.\n\n14\n\nTo model the contribution of the W +jet background in the (\u03bd \u03bd\u0304)(q q\u0304 \u2032 q q\u0304 \u2032 ) channel, we have simply rescaled\nthe Z+jet contribution by 1.5. This brings us into rough agreement with existing monojet searches\n(e.g., [59]) without requiring us to explicitly model how well a leptonic W can be vetoed.\n\n26\n\n\fFully hadronic W W (\u2217) associated with\nLeptonic Z\n\nInvisible Z\n\npT (h) > mreco\nZ \u2032 /3\nmZ \u2032 \u2212 15% < mreco\nZ \u2032 < mZ \u2032 + 15%\n\nmZ \u2032 \u2212 30% < mreco\nZ \u2032 < mZ \u2032 + 10%\n\nTABLE VI: Kinematic cuts imposed for the analysis of Z \u2032 \u2192 Zh \u2192 Z(q q\u0304 \u2032 q q\u0304 \u2032 ).\nSemileptonic W W (\u2217) associated with\nLeptonic Z\n\nHadronic Z\n\nInvisible Z\n\npT (jW jW ) > 0.1 \u00d7 pT (Z)\n\npT (jW jW ) > 0.3 \u00d7 E\n6 T\n\npT (Z) > mreco\nZ \u2032 /3\n\npT (j2 ) < 0.3 \u00d7 pT (jW jW )\n\nreco\nmZ \u2032 \u2212 15% < mreco\nZ \u2032 < mZ \u2032 + 15% mZ \u2032 \u2212 10% < mZ \u2032 < mZ \u2032 + 10%\n\nmreco\nZ \u2032 > mZ \u2032 /2\n\nTABLE VII: Kinematic cuts imposed for the analysis of Z \u2032 \u2192 Zh \u2192 Z(l\u03bdq q\u0304 \u2032 ). j2 represents the\nsum of subjets from the second-hardest fat-jet.\nDileptonic W W (\u2217) associated with\nLeptonic Z\n\nHadronic Z\n\nInvisible Z\n\nh(125):\n\nm(l1+ l2\u2212 \u03bd) < 135\n\n10 < m(l1+ l2\u2212 ) < 75\n\nh(200):\n\nm(l1+ l2\u2212 \u03bd) < 210\n\n10 < m(l1+ l2\u2212 ) < 150\n\npT (Z) > mreco\nZ \u2032 /3\n\npT (j1 ) < 0.3 \u00d7 6ET\n\nmZ \u2032 \u2212 10% < mreco\nZ \u2032 < mZ \u2032 + 10%\n\nmreco\nZ \u2032 > 0.3 \u00d7 mZ \u2032\n\nTABLE VIII: Kinematic cuts imposed for the analysis of Z \u2032 \u2192 Zh \u2192 Z(l\u03bdl\u03bd).

Because the jets and subjets that we consider are\nvery energetic, and calorimeter energy measurements become better with increasing energy\n(down to few-percent resolution), we do not expect that energy resolution effects will be a\nmajor obstacle. Spatial resolution, on the other hand, may pose a very serious fundamental\nlimitation. For example, in our most energetic Z-jets and diboson-jets, individual subjets\nmay lie inside of a single hadronic calorimeter cell.\nThe ATLAS and CMS detectors consist of multiple subdetectors, of which the HCAL is\nthe spatially coarsest. By combining tracker, ECAL, and HCAL information together, it is\npossible to extract a very detailed picture of the energy flow of the event [60]. However, it\nis known that tracking becomes less reliable as jet energies increase, due to the increasing\ndensity of hits and the decreasing track curvatures. This may not be a fatal issue, but to be\nconservative we consider only the ECAL and HCAL.\nIn a previous paper [4], we suggested a simple method to hybridize the ECAL's 4\u20135 times\n\n31\n\n\fnormalized rate\n\nnormalized rate\n\n0.35\n0.3\n0.25\n\n10-1\n\n0.2\n0.15\n10-2\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n250\n(GeV)\nmreco\nh\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n250\n(GeV)\nmreco\nh\n\nFIG. 11: Distributions of the reconstructed fully hadronic 125 GeV Higgs mass for 3 TeV Z \u2032 \u2192\nZh \u2192 (\u03bd \u03bd\u0304)(q q\u0304 \u2032 q q\u0304 \u2032 ) (left) and quark-jets with pT \u2243 1500 GeV (right) processed through our 4-body\ndeclustering procedure. Displayed are particle-level (black), simple ECAL and HCAL cells (red),\nECAL cells rescaled per containing HCAL cell (pink), and ECAL cells rescaled per containing\nHCAL cluster (blue).\n\nbetter spatial resolution with the full ECAL+HCAL energy measurement: Within each\nHCAL cell and its associated block of ECAL cells, rescale the ECAL cell energies so that\nthe sum of ECAL cells matches the full ECAL+HCAL energy. These rescaled ECAL cells\nthen serve as the 4-vectors input into jet clustering and jet substructure. We found that\nthis technique was very effective at correcting off the mass-distorting effects of the HCAL\ngeometry, at least in the context of a toy calorimeter model with perfect energy-sampling\ncells.\nHere, we add some important extra layers of reality to our toy calorimeter by approximately accounting for two additional effects: 1) The energy deposited by each particle will\nshower into several cells, and 2) Hadrons will often deposit energy in the ECAL due to\nnuclear interactions. The two effects partially cancel each other, as the former introduces\nspurious substructure, whereas the latter increases the share of jet energy collected in the\nmore finely-segmented ECAL.\nTo implement the spatial energy smearing, we continuously distribute the energy of each\nparticle using the profile parametrization in [61], setting the Moli\u00e8re radius equal to one cell\n32\n\n\funit (individually for ECAL and HCAL). (See [62] for a similar model.) For simplicity, we\napply the smearing in \u03b7\u2013\u03c6 space rather than in real space, which should be an adequate\napproximation except at high \u03b7. ECAL and HCAL cells are respectively set to 0.02 and\n0.1 unit across. Our spatial smearing is specifically designed to furnish a good model of the\nCMS ECAL, and is likely somewhat pessimistic for the HCAL of either experiment.\nTo implement the hadronic ECAL deposits, we apply a 65% probability for charged\nhadrons above an energy of 5 GeV to deposit some energy. The fraction of energy is taken\nfrom a simple linearly-falling distribution that hits zero probability at 100% deposition.\nThese provide a coarse model of the CMS ECAL response to charged hadrons as observed\nin test beam data [63, 64]. Including this effect increases the typical EM fraction of a jet\nfrom about 25% (mainly \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) to 40%. In either case, the RMS of the distribution is\ncomparable to half of the mean. More realistic jet EM fractions in the complete detector\nwould be 55% for CMS [65] and 80% for ATLAS [66], with similar relative RMS.\nWe can see the effects of our calorimeter model on pT \u2243 1500 GeV Z-jet and Higgsjet mass reconstructions in Figs. 10 and 11, respectively. (Examples of diboson-jet event\ndisplays appear in Fig. 1.) If we simply add up the ECAL and HCAL cell 4-vectors, there\nis an obvious degradation of the signal peaks. Perhaps more worrisome, the pT scale and\nspatial resolution scale interplay to create an artificial mass feature in the background QCD\njets at about 100 GeV. Applying our naive ECAL rescaling brings us closer to particlelevel, but there is still an obvious bias. To achieve a better correction, we can apply a\nslight modification to the ECAL rescaling. We first \"undo\" the spatial smearing effects by\nclustering HCAL cells with the anti-kT algorithm [58] with R = 0.17 (smaller than 2 cells but\n\u221a\nbigger than 2 cells). We then rescale all ECAL cells associated with each cluster of HCAL\ncells, rather than cell-by-cell. The result of this procedure also appears in Figs. 10 and 11,\nand clearly indicates that most of the remaining bias has been removed. Not only is the\nsignal peak approximately restored, but the artificial intrinsic mass scale of the background\njets has been moved down to O(20 GeV).\nThe quality of the final mass reconstruction may seem somewhat surprising, given that\nthe fraction of energy deposited in the ECAL fluctuates a lot. The mass of a quasi-collinear\np\nsubjet pair goes like pT \u2206R z(1 \u2212 z), where pT is the total transverse momentum of the\npair, \u2206R is their \u03b7\u2013\u03c6 distance, and z = [0, 0.5] parametrizes their energy sharing. With\nour procedure, pT and \u2206R are very well-measured, and the potential problem is in the z\n33\n\n\fmeasurement. For subjets with equal energy sharing, the\n\np\nz(1 \u2212 z) factor is 0.5. Even if we\n\nmismeasured the energy sharing by a factor of 2, so that z \u2192 0.25, the result shifts by only\n14%. More asymmetric splittings suffer more: z = 0.1 mismeasured as z = 0.05 changes the\nmass by 27%. However, averaging over many subjet configurations and EM fractions, the\nnet mass smearing effect is rather modest.\nThere are many other aspects of the real calorimeters that we did not consider, such as\nshower fluctuations, noise, showering in the tracker, and magnetic field effects. We do not\nexpect that these will significantly alter our conclusions, but they would certainly need to\nbe accounted for to verify that our cluster-rescaling trick works as advertised. We also note\nthat this type of procedure should be useful for other jet substructure applications that\nrequire fine angular resolution, such as high-pT top-tagging.\n\n[1] ATLAS Collaboration, An Update to the Combined Search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson\n\u221a\nwith the ATLAS Detector at the LHC Using up to 4.9 fb\u22121 of pp Collision Data at s = 7 TeV,\nATLAS-CONF-2012-019.\n[2] CMS Collaboration, Combined Results of Searches for a Higgs Boson in the Context of the\nStandard Model and Beyond-Standard Models, CMS PAS HIG-12-008.\n[3] The TEVNPH Working Group, Combined CDF and D0 Search for Standard Model Higgs\nBoson Production with up to 10 fb\u22121 of Data, FERMILAB-CONF-12-065-E.\n[4] A.
