In quantum metrology, the goal is to estimate an unknown\nparameter such as a small phase shift \u03c6 from its effects on the outcomes of a final measurement f . In conventional\nweak measurements, the interaction parameter is fixed and the effects of post-selecting a final measurement outcome\nf on the distribution of the weak measurement outcomes is considered. However, it has long been understood that\nthe relation between the observed pointer shift of a weak measurement and the known weak value of a specific postselected measurement can also be used to determine the value of an unknown measurement interaction parameter [1, 2].\nSurprisingly, there seems to be a lack of work clarifying the relation between the outcomes of weak measurements and\nthe sensitivity of the corresponding parameter estimation. Although the possible role of weak measurements in optical\ninterferometry has recently been addressed [3], the focus there has been more on the specific technical realizations of\nthe measurement than on the conceptual correspondence between weak measurements and quantum metrology. In\nthe following, I will try to bridge the gap between parameter estimation and weak measurements by formulating the\nquantum theory of a general weak measurement as a parameter estimation problem. Weak measurements can then\nbe seen as a natural part of quantum metrology, providing new insights into the fundamental properties of quantum\nmeasurements and quantum statistics.\nIn general, weak measurements can be formulated in terms of measurement operators that are essentially independent of the technical details of system-pointer coupling [4]. Every weak measurement outcome m then corresponds\nto a self-adjoint measurement operator \u00cam that represents the quantum statistics of the measurement. Since we are\nconsidering weak measurements, the output probabilities wm are only slightly modified by the target observable \u00c2.\nThe magnitude of this modification depends on the strength of the measurement interaction. To formulate weak measurements as a parameter estimation problem, this coupling strength should be represented by an unknown interaction\nparameter \u01eb. The measurement operators can then be expressed as\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u221a\n\u00cam = wm 1\u0302 + \u01eb\u03bam \u00c2 ,\n(1)\nwhere \u03bam represents the correlation between the outcome and the effects of the coupling for the specific type of\nmeasurement interaction. A convenient normalization of this correlation factor is\nX\nwm \u03ba2m = 1.\n(2)\nm\n\nEq.(1) defines the parameter estimation problem in terms of an unknown parameter in a quantum mechanical operator\nacting on an input state. This is essentially equivalent to the phase shift problem, where the parameter modifies the\nunitary transformation acting on the quantum state. In fact, the operators \u00cam can be transformed into a random\nunitary transformation by replacing the real interaction parameter with an imaginary phase parameter. As pointed\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: hofmann@hiroshima-u.ac.jp\n\n\f2\nout in [5], this means that the estimation of a phase is equal to the estimation of the interaction parameter in a\nmeasurement of an imaginary weak value.\nUltimately, the parameter estimation procedure must be based on a final measurement represented by a set of\northogonal states {| f i}. The joint probability of obtaining a weak result m and a final measurement result f is then\ngiven by\n!!\nhf | \u00c2 | \u03c8i\n2\n.\n(3)\np(m, f ) = wm |hf | \u03c8i| 1 + 2\u01eb\u03bam Re\nhf | \u03c8i\nThe dependence of this probability on the interaction parameter \u01eb is given by the real part of the weak value of \u00c2 for\nthe initial state | \u03c8i and a post-selection of | f i. Specifically, the logarithmic derivatives are proportional to the real\nweak values,\n#\n\"\n\u2202\nhf | \u00c2 | \u03c8i\n.\n(4)\nln (p(m, f )) |\u01eb=0 = 2\u03bam Re\n\u2202\u01eb\nhf | \u03c8i\nThus the weak values of a final measurement | f i define the relevant statistics for an estimation of the interaction\nstrength.\nIt is well known that the sensitivity of a parameter estimation problem is determined by the Fisher information,\nwhich is the inverse of the squared estimation error for an optimal measurement strategy. For the estimate of the\ninteraction parameter \u01eb described here, this sensitivity is given by\n\u00132\n\u0012\nX\n1\n\u2202\n=\nln (p(m, f )) |\u01eb=0\np(m, f )\n\u03b4\u01eb2\n\u2202\u01eb\nm,f\n#2\n\"\nX\nhf | \u00c2 | \u03c8i\n= 4\n,\np(f ) Re\nhf | \u03c8i\n\n(5)\n\nf\n\nwhere the joint probability at \u01eb = 0 is given by p(m, f ) = wm p(f ), so that the sum over m can be determined using\nthe normalization in eq.(2). The optimal sensitivity is obtained for final measurements with completely real weak\nvalues,\n#\n\"\nhf | \u00c2 | \u03c8i\n= 0.\n(6)\nIm\nhf | \u03c8i\nFor all measurements that fulfill this condition, p(f ) = |hf | \u03c8i|2 cancels out the division by the corresponding\nprobability amplitude hf | \u03c8i in the weak values, and the summation over f converts into a general Hilbert space\ntrace. The maximal sensitivity of the interaction parameter estimate is then given by four times the expectation value\nof the squared operator observable \u00c2 in the initial state,\n1\n= h\u03c8 | \u00c22 | \u03c8i.\n\u03b4\u01eb2\n\n(7)\n\nThe most simple way of obtaining this sensitivity is to perform a final measurement of the eigenstates of \u00c2 in the\noutput. The weak values are then equal to the eigenvalues of \u00c2 and the interaction parameter is determined from the\npointer shifts obtained for each eigenvalue. This procedure can be understood classically as a precise determination\nof the unknown parameter \u00c2 in the system-meter coupling. Since any uncertainty in \u00c2 would add to the uncertainty\nof the estimate, it seems to be best to perform a precise measurement of \u00c2. However, the same sensitivity can be\nachieved by any final measurement {| f i}, as long as all of the weak values are real. It is therefore possible to vary\nthe measurement strategy without losing sensitivity. In fact, it can be seen from eq.(5) that high weak values do\ncontribute more to the Fisher information. However, this is compensated by their low probability p(f ). Effectively, it\nis possible to \"shunt\" the phase sensitivity into just a few measurement results. In the extreme case, it is possible to\ndefine a final measurement so that all weak values except one are zero, so that the parameter estimate can be derived\nfrom the frequency of only a single result.\nThere are two important conclusions that can be drawn from the observation that the same maximal sensitivity can\nbe obtained from any set of real weak values, whether they correspond to the eigenvalues or not. On the fundamental\nside, it is remarkable that the use of weak values in place of the unknown parameter \u00c2 that determines the effects\n\n\f3\nof the interaction on the measurement result m does not add any noise compared to the use of the eigenvalues\ndetermined in a final von Neumann measurement. This result supports the viewpoint that real weak values represent\nzero uncertainty estimates of the observable \u00c2 as expressed in the works of Hall [6] and Johansen [7], based on the\ntheories of Ozawa as presented in his price lecture at QCMC 2010 [8]. On the more practical side, it is significant\nthat one should distinguish the improved resolution represented by the enhancement of the weak values from the\nsensitivity, similar to the same distinction recently made between resolution and sensitivity in the context of phase\nestimation from interference fringes [9]. The enhancement of the weak values is still a powerful tool for obtaining\nconclusive data without the need for a thorough statistical analysis. Combined with the fact that the weak values do\nseem to provide a valid representation of the observable effects of physical properties, this distinction should help to\nmotivate and guide further research into the intriguing statistics of quantum measurements.\nPart of this work has been supported by the Grant-in-Aid program of the Japanese Society for the Promotion of\nScience, JSPS.
