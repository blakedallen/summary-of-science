An issue that has aroused considerable interest is the possibility [1, 2] of creating\nmetastable states that break the discrete global symmetries of parity (P ) and chargeparity (CP ) satisfied by the QCD Lagrangian 1 . There is a theorem by Vafa and Witten\nwhich states that there can be no stable parity violating phase of QCD [3]. The conditions of applicability of this theorem have attracted much attention recently [4, 5, 6]. The\nVafa-Witten theorem does not however preclude the possibility of forming metastable\ndomains that violate parity (and charge\u2013parity) [1]. Furthermore, it has been suggested\nrecently that the Vafa\u2013Witten theorem may not be applicable at finite temperature [7].\nSeveral experimental signatures have recently been suggested that would be sensitive\nto the formation of these P and CP odd metastable states [2]. Experimental searches\nare currently underway at RHIC. A preliminary report on their status was discussed at\nQuark Matter 2001 [8].\nIn the discussions of Refs. [1, 2], the formation of P and CP \u2013odd domains is studied\nin the context of the restoration of the axial U(1) symmetry at finite temperature. A\nnon\u2013linear \u03c3\u2013model which incorporates the breaking of the U(1) axial symmetry 2 , the Di\nVecchia-Veneziano-Witten Lagrangian [10], (VVW) is constructed and it is shown that\nthere exist metastable states (corresponding to local minima of the potential) which spontaneously break P and CP [1]. The likelihood of forming long-lived metastable states\ndepends on the coefficient a \u223c m2\u03b7\u2032 of the anomaly term in the VVW Lagrangian \u2013 they\nare more likely when a(T ) \u2192 0 as the temperature approaches the deconfinement temperature, T \u2192 Tc . There is evidence from lattice simulations that this is the case. The\nanomaly term is proportional to the topological susceptibility and lattice data suggest\nthat the topological susceptibility for both quenched and full QCD drops rapidly in the\nvicinity of Tc and is consistent with zero by T > 1.5Tc (1.2Tc ) for Nf = 2 (Nf = 4) [11].\nFurther, large Nc analyses suggest that a(T ) \u2192 0 as T \u2192 Tc [1, 2, 13, 12].\n\nIn Ref. [2], the decay of P and CP odd metastable states into pions is described by\nthe Wess\u2013Zumino\u2013Witten term [14] in the chiral Lagrangian. This term preserves the\nnet chirality or handedness generated in the P and CP odd domains. The magnitude of\nthe net asymmetry produced by this mechanism in heavy ion collisions is estimated to\nbe \u223c 10\u22123 [2]. The signatures of P and CP odd domains were investigated also in Refs.\n[15, 16, 17], and include an enhancement in the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 yields, generically associated\nwith the UA (1) restoration [18].\n\nIt is of great interest to investigate how the topological susceptibility is affected by\nthe dynamical conditions generated in the early stage of a heavy ion collision. Immediately after a high energy nuclear collision, as a consequence of the phenomenon of gluon\nsaturation [19], large color electric and magnetic fields are generated. These can in principle produce a large amount of topological charge through the mechanism of sphaleron\n1\nThis is true in the absence of a \u03b8\u2013term which would break P and CP explicitly. We will assume\nthat \u03b8 = 0 here.\n2\nFor a recent study of UA (1) restoration in the linear sigma model, see Ref. [9].\n\n2\n\n\ftransitions already in the initial stage of the heavy ion collision. However, as we will\nargue below, the boost invariance of the initial stage of the heavy ion collision suppresses\nsphaleron transitions. The primary mechanism for the generation of topological charge\nat the early stage is by fluctuations of the color electric and magnetic fields. For a\ntranslationally invariant system, the fluctuations in the topological charge determine the\ntopological susceptibility.\nIn this paper, we estimate the size of topological charge fluctuations in the early\nstage of a heavy ion collision. Our computation is performed within the framework of\na classical effective field theory (EFT) [20, 21] approach to small x physics. In this\napproach, parton distributions in a nucleus before the collision form a color glass condensate (CGC) [22, 23]. The shattering of the color glass condensate and subsequent\nmultiparticle production in high energy scattering has been discussed for eA [20], pA [29]\nand for nuclear collisions [24, 30]. For nuclear collisions, the problem can be formulated\nin the EFT [24] and the temporal evolution of gluons produced after the collisions can be\nsolved for numerically [26]. The initial energy [27] and number [28] of produced gluons\nhave been computed previously in this approach. The CGC idea has been shown to be\nconsistent with many features of data from heavy ion collisions [30, 31].\nWe find in the CGC model that the fluctuations in topological charge are quite small\nat RHIC and LHC energies. The root mean squared topological charge is only one unit\nper two units of rapidity at RHIC energies and one unit per unit of rapidity at LHC\nenergies. Our results suggest that the form of the effective potential in the \u03b8\u2013direction\nis quite shallow at early times. This result makes favorable the formation of P and CP\nodd bubbles at later times \u2013 namely, the scenario that was first discussed in Refs. [1, 2].\nRecently instanton/sphaleron approaches to multiparticle production have been investigated [32, 33, 34, 35]. In Ref. [34] it was shown that in the initial stage of nuclear\ncollisions instanton transitions (and therefore the topological susceptibility) are severely\nsuppressed by strong classical gluon fields. Shuryak has suggested that the dominant\nmechanism for particle production in nuclear collisions may be through the decay of\nsphalerons [35]. If so, a likely consequence is that the ensuing sphaleron transitions will\ngenerate large P and CP violation already in the initial stage of the nuclear collision. In\nour approach, however, sphaleron transitions are suppressed by strict boost invariance.\nSphaleron transitions, if they occur, will take place at a later stage when the strict boost\ninvariance of the initial state is lost. We have estimated the topological charge generated\nby sphaleron transitions in a hot gluon plasma and find, for RHIC energies, that it is\nlarge compared to the topological charge generated in the initial stage by classical fields.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we briefly review the CGC picture\nof classical gluon production in heavy ion collisions. The no\u2013go theorem for sphaleron\ntransitions for a strictly boost invariant system is derived in section 3. Numerical results\nfor the Chern\u2013Simons charge are presented in section 4. Its relation to empirical observables is also discussed there. In section 5, we discuss estimates for P and CP violation\nfrom sphaleron transitions at finite temperature in equilibrium hot gluodynamics. We\nalso comment on the implications of these results (versus those in the boost invariant\nCGC picture) for the heavy ion experiments.\n3\n\n\f2\n\nClassical gluon production in nuclear collisions\n\nIn a high energy heavy ion collision, the dynamics of the central rapidity region is determined by the small x modes in the individual nuclei before the collision. At small x,\nthe gluon density grows rapidly \u2013 however, repulsive effects soon become important and\nslow down the growth of the gluon density. This phenomenon is called saturation and\nhas been discussed extensively in the literature [19]. The occupation number of gluons\nin the saturated regime is proportional to 1/\u03b1s (\u039bs ) evaluated at a saturation scale \u039bs .\nIf \u039bs \u226b \u039bQCD , the occupation number is large and classical methods may be applied\nto study parton distributions in the nuclei [20, 21]. It has been shown recently that\na RG-improved generalization of this classical effective field theory (EFT) reproduces\nseveral key results in small-x QCD [21, 23]. The classical EFT was first applied to the\nstudy of collisions of large nuclei by Kovner, McLerran and Weigert [24]. The model,\nas applied to nuclear collisions, may be summarized as follows. The colliding nuclei are\nidealize to travel along the light cone The high-x and the low-x modes in the nuclei are\ntreated separately. Th former corresponds to valence quarks and hard sea partons and\nare considered recoilless sources of color charge For each of the large Lorentz-contracted\nnuclei (for simplicity, we will consider only collisions of identical nuclei), this results in\na static Gaussian distribution of their color charge density \u03c11,2 in th transverse plane\n\"\n\n1\nP ([\u03c1]) \u221d exp \u2212 2\n2\u039bs\n\nZ\n\n2\n\nd\n\nrt \u03c121,2 (rt )\n\n#\n\n.\n\nThe variance \u039bs of the color charge distribution is the only dimensionful parameter of\nthe model, apart from the linear size L of the nucleus. For central impact parameters,\n\u039bs can be estimated in terms of single-nucleon structure functions [25]. It is assumed,\nin addition, that the nucleus is infinitely thin in the longitudinal direction. Under this\nsimplifying assumption, the resulting gauge fields are explicitly boost-invariant.\nThe small x fields are then described by the classical Yang-Mills equations\nD\u03bc F\u03bc\u03bd = J\u03bd\n\n(1)\n\nwith the random sources on the two light cones: J\u03bd = 1,2 \u03b4\u03bd,\u00b1 \u03b4(x\u2213 )\u03c11,2 (rt ). The two\nsigns correspond to two possible directions of motion along the beam axis z. As shown\nby Kovner, McLerran and Weigert (KMW) [24], low-x fields in the central region of the\ncollision obey sourceless Yang-Mills equations (this region is in the forward light cone of\nboth nuclei) with the initial conditions in the A\u03c4 = 0 gauge given by\nP\n\nAi = Ai1 + Ai2 ;\n\nA\u00b1 = \u00b1\n\nig \u00b1 i i\nx [A1 , A2 ].\n2\n\n(2)\n\nHere the pure gauge fields Ai1,2 are solutions of (1) for each of the two nuclei in the\nabsence of the other nucleus.\nIn order to obtain the resulting gluon field configuration at late proper times, one\nneeds to solve (1) with the initial condition (2). Since the latter depends on the random\n4\n\n\fcolor source, averages over realizations of the source must be performed. KMW showed\nthat in perturbation theory the gluon number distribution by transverse momentum (per\nunit rapidity) suffers from an infrared divergence and argued that the distribution must\nhave the form\n!\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u039bs 4\nk\u22a5\nnk\u22a5 \u221d\n(3)\nln\n\u03b1s k \u22a5\n\u039bs\nfor k\u22a5 \u226b \u039bs . The log term clearly indicates that the perturbative description breaks\ndown for k\u22a5 \u223c \u039bs .\nA reliable way to go beyond perturbation theory is to re-formulate the EFT on\na lattice by discretizing the transverse plane. The resulting lattice theory can then be\nsolved numerically. We shall not dwell here on the details of the lattice formulation, which\nis described in detail in Ref. [26, 27]. Keeping in mind that \u039bs and the linear size L of the\nnucleus are the only physically interesting dimensional parameters of the model [22], we\ncan write any dimensional quantity q as \u039bds fq (\u039bs L), where d is the dimension of q. All the\nnon-trivial physical information is contained in the dimensionless function fq (\u039bs L). We\ncan estimate the values of the product \u039bs L which correspond to key collider experiments.\nAssuming Au-Au collisions, we take L = 11.6 fm (for a square nucleus!) and estimate\nthe saturation scale \u039bs to be 2 GeV for RHIC and 4 GeV for LHC [25]. Also, we have\napproximately g = 2 for energies of interest. The rough estimate is then \u039bs L \u2248 120-150\nfor RHIC and \u039bs L \u2248 240-300 for LHC. Since the gluon distribution in nuclei is not known\nto great precision, there is a considerable systematic uncertainty in these estimates.\nThis model has been applied recently to study classical gluon production. The energy\nand number distributions have been computed numerically, and the dependence of these\nquantities on \u039bs has been determined [27, 28]. We will now apply the model to compute\nthe Chern Simons number generated in the early stages of a heavy ion collision.\n\n3\n\nBoost invariance and Chern Simons number\n\nIn general, the Chern-Simons (CS) number changes under a gauge transformation by\nan integer equal to the winding number of that transformation. Since the potential of\nthe theory is invariant under all gauge transformations, there exists a direction in the\nfunctional space along which the potential is periodic. The system can move along that\ndirection arbitrarily far from its initial configuration. Such motion generates arbitrarily\nlarge changes of the CS number or, equivalently, arbitrarily large values of topological\ncharge. Dynamical, real time, processes corresponding to nontrivial gauge transformations are called sphaleron transitions. In a large space-time volume these transitions\nproceed independently in causally unrelated regions. If, in addition, the space-time is\ntranslation-invariant, the topological charge for a large space-time volume is a random\nwalk:\n2\n\nh(Ncs (t) \u2212 Ncs (t\u2032 )) i = \u0393V (t \u2212 t\u2032 ) ,\n5\n\n(4)\n\n\fwhere \u0393 is known as the sphaleron transition rate, or as the topological susceptibility.\nHere, and in the following, h...i means an ensemble average: the thermal ensemble in\nthermal equilibrium, and the ensemble of (central) nuclear collision events in the case of\ninterest here. This random walk behavior was indeed observed in numerical simulations\nof SU(2) [36] and SU(3) [37] Yang-Mills theories at high temperature.\nThe dynamics of the CS number in the central region of a nuclear collision differs from\nthe generic case in two ways. Firstly, the time translation invariance is broken by the\ninstance of the collision itself. Secondly, and more importantly, there are no nontrivial\nboost-invariant gauge transformations. Consequently, for boost-invariant configurations,\nsuch as those in the central region, the potential is not periodic, and there can be no\nsphaleron transitions. Instead, one expects the CS number to fluctuate in the vicinity of\nzero.\nIn order to make this second point explicit, we shall now examine the form of the CS\nnumber functional for boost-invariant configurations, and show it to be invariant under\nall boost-invariant gauge transformations. It will then follow that, in this special case,\nthe CS number cannot be changed by a dynamical process equivalent to a gauge transformation, i.e., that sphaleron transitions are prohibited for a boost invariant system.\n\u221a\nIt is convenient for us to use the coordinates (~rt , \u03c4, \u03b7). Here \u03c4 = 2x+ x\u2212 is the\nproper time, \u03b7 = ln(x+ /x\u2212 )/2 is the space-time rapidity, and ~rt \u2261 (x, y) is the position\nin the transverse plane. For the components of the gauge potential, the boost invariance\nassumption (see the discussion immediately prior to Eq. 1) means that\n~ t (\u03c4, xt , \u03b7) = A\n~ t (\u03c4, xt ) ; A\u03b7 (\u03c4, xt , \u03b7) \u2261 \u03a6(\u03c4, xt ) ,\nA\n\n(5)\n\nand the system effectively becomes (2+1)-dimensional, with A\u03b7 becoming an adjoint\nscalar field. It is also convenient to remove the fourth component of A by imposing the\ngauge condition A\u03c4 = 0.\nNow consider the quantity\n1\n\u03bd=\n16\u03c0 2\n\nZ\n\nd2 xt \u03a6a B a ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere\na\nB a = Fxy\n= \u2202x Aay \u2212 \u2202y Aax + g\u01ebabc Abx Acy\n\n(7)\n\nis the component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the transverse plane. This\nquantity is obviously invariant under all rapidity independent gauge transformations. In\norder to verify that \u03bd is the CS number per unit rapidity, we will compute its proper time\nderivative (denoted by a dot in the following) and show it to be equal to the topological\ncharge density integrated over the transverse plane. We recall that the topological charge\ndensity is given by\n1 ~ ~\nE*B,\n16\u03c0 2\n6\n\n(8)\n\n\f~ a and B\n~ a being the color electric and magnetic fields, respectively; the anomaly equation\nE\nrelates this quantity to the divergence of the chiral current.\nTo this end, it suffices to write out \u03bd\u0307 explicitly, using (7), and integrate the terms containing \u2202x \u0226ay and \u2202y \u0226ax by parts in the transverse plane, assuming that the corresponding\nboundary terms vanish. The result is\n\u0011\n1 Z 2 \u0010 a a\na a\na a\nd\nx\n\u03a6\u0307\nB\n+\n\u0226\nD\n\u03a6\n\u2212\n\u0226\nD\n\u03a6\n,\n\u03bd\u0307 =\nt\nx\ny\ny\nx\n16\u03c0 2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere Dia \u03a6 is the covariant derivative: Dia \u03a6 \u2261 \u2202i \u03a6a +\u01ebabc Abi \u03a6c . To complete the proof, we\n~a*B\n~ a;\nnote that (a) for boost invariant configurations, the integrand of (9) is equal to \u03c4 E\nand (b) the space-time volume element in the \u03c4, \u03b7, ~rt coordinates is d4 x = \u03c4 d\u03b7d\u03c4 d2 xt .\nHence we have shown that the proper time variation of \u03bd in a boost invariant process gives\nthe topological charge per unit rapidity of the process. If any such process is equivalent\nto a gauge transformation, it leaves \u03bd unchanged, the corresponding topological charge\nvanishes, and no sphaleron transitions are possible.\nIn the EFT description of nuclear collisions the scalar field \u03a6 vanishes at \u03c4 = 0 [26],\nand, therefore, \u03bd(\u03c4 = 0) = 0. In other words, the topological charge of the process at\nany given \u03c4 is simply \u03b7\u03bd(\u03c4 ), where \u03b7 is the rapidity extent of the process. Since the\nEFT has a parity-even action, both signs of \u03bd(\u03c4 ) are equally probable, and the ensemble\naverage of \u03bd(\u03c4 ) vanishes. Our principal object of interest is then h\u03bd 2 (\u03c4 )i. In the absence\nof sphaleron transitions, we cannot expect the proper time evolution of \u03bd to resemble a\nrandom walk. Indeed, as we shall see in the next section, h\u03bd 2 (\u03c4 )i approaches a constant\nat large \u03c4 .\nStrictly speaking, because of the strict boost invariance built into our approach,\nh\u03bd 2 (\u03c4 )i per unit space-time volume cannot be interpreted as the topological susceptibility.\nNevertheless, the computed h\u03bd 2 (\u03c4 )i is a measure of the contribution of classical fields to\nthe topological susceptibility. As will be discussed further in Section 5, the likelihood of\nforming long-lived P and CP odd domains depends sensitively on this quantity.\n\n4\n\nNumerical results\n\nWe use a lattice formulation of the EFT developed in [26, 27, 28]. As explained in these\nreferences, the key dimensionless parameter for those observables which exist in the\ncontinuum limit is \u039bs L, where L is the radius of the nucleus (assuming a square nucleus,\nL2 = \u03c0R2 ). The value of \u039bs , expressed in units of the lattice spacing a, indicates\nhow close the system is to the continuum limit. In the current study, for an SU(2)\ngauge theory 3 we set \u039bs a = 0.29. The CS number \u03bd is a dimensionless quantity, whose\n3\n\nWe study an SU(2) gauge theory since it is simpler to simulate numerically. The physically more\ninteresting case of an SU(3) gauge theory was studied recently and gluon number distributions computed [47].

In\nthat study, we determined that discretization artifacts are very small for N at \u039bs a = 0.29.\nWe examined the proper time evolution of \u03bd for three values of \u039bs L, namely, 74.2,\n148.4, and 297. The last two of these correspond roughly to central Au-Au collisions\nin the RHIC and LHC regimes, respectively. In each of the three cases, we generated\nabout 80 independent initial configurations and solved the classical equations of motion\nfor the duration of proper time of at least 60/\u039bs (this corresponds to 6 fm for RHIC).\nThe average proper time histories of \u03bd 2 in each case are presented in Figure 1. Evidently,\n\u03bd varies over a much longer time scale, compared to other global quantities, such as the\ntotal energy and the total particle number [27, 28]. Nevertheless, h\u03bd 2 (\u03c4 )i does approach\na constant value at late \u03c4 . That constant value is a rapidly growing function of \u039bs L.\nSince the dynamics considered here is exactly boost-invariant, (h\u03bd 2 (\u03c4 )i)1/2 is a measure\nof the anomalous chirality violation per unit rapidity in the initial stage of a central\ncollision.\nTo estimate the magnitude of the effect, we took the proper time average of h\u03bd 2 (\u03c4 )i\nbetween \u039bs \u03c4 = 30 and \u039bs \u03c4 = 65. The results are summarized in Table 1. If we\ntake the experimental range of two units of rapidity, it follows that for RHIC we have\napproximately one unit of the topological charge squared for two units of rapidity while at\nLHC one may have two units of topological charge squared in the same rapidity interval.\nNote that h\u03bd 2 i is approximately proportional to (\u039bs R)2 , i.e., to the transverse area in\nunits of the nonperturbative scale \u039bs . This means that dynamical processes contributing\nto the topological charge become uncorrelated at spatial separations exceeding \u039bs , and\nthe resulting fluctuations of \u03bd add up randomly.\n\u039bs R\nh\u03bd 2 i\n\n41.9\n83.7\n167.5\n0.046 \u00b1 0.004 0.16 \u00b1 0.01 0.69 \u00b1 0.05\n\nTable 1: The average value of h\u03bd 2 i, tabulated as a function of the dimensionless parameter\n\u039bs R.\nAs we have explained in the preceding sections, there is no CS number diffusion in\na boost invariant setting, nor is there a ground state degeneracy. It is for this reason\nthat h\u03bd 2 (\u03c4 )i approaches a constant at large \u03c4 , instead of growing linearly, as would be\nthe case if sphaleron transitions were permitted. Also, as Figure 2 illustrates, there is\nno special significance to integer values of \u03bd other than zero, which in a general case\ncorrespond to degenerate minima of the potential.\n\n9\n\n\f5\n\nComparison with other estimates of the topological susceptibility and experimental ramifications\n\nThus far, we have assumed that strict boost invariance holds in heavy ion collisions\nat very high energies. If strict boost invariance does not hold, sphaleron transitions\nare allowed. Whether sphaleron transitions turn on slowly or rapidly when strict boost\ninvariance is relaxed is not clear. A way to answer this question is to introduce a small\nperturbation a(xt , \u03b7, \u03c4 ), namely,\n\u00c3(xt , \u03b7, \u03c4 ) = A(xt , \u03c4 ) + a(xt , \u03b7, \u03c4 ) ,\n\n(10)\n\nin the Yang\u2013Mills equations and to study how it evolves. While the Yang-Mills equations\nequations can be linearized with respect to a(xt , \u03b7, \u03c4 ), such a study has to be performed\nnumerically, since A(xt , \u03c4 ) is not known analytically [48].\nLet us assume that the system does thermalize and strict boost invariance of field\nconfigurations is lost 4 . We then need an estimate of the sphaleron transition rate in\na hot gluon plasma. To simplify the setup, we shall first ignore dynamical fermions\nand assume that the temperature T is much larger than any other dimensional scale\nin the problem. It then follows from dimensional considerations [38] that the rate is\nproportional to T 4 However, the dependence of the rate on the coupling constant g is\nless obvious. In the weak-coupling regime the sphaleron transitions are dominated by\nsoft modes, with momenta of the order of g 2 T . The time scale for the transition depends\non how important is the interaction between these degrees of freedom and hard thermal\nmodes. A series of perturbative studies [44, 45], performed at extremely weak coupling\n(ln(1/g) \u226b 1), suggest that this interaction sets the time scale for sphaleron transitions\nto (g 4T )\u22121 up to logarithmic corrections. Then the coupling constant dependence is\n\u0393 \u221d \u03b1s5 T 4 , and a recent numerical estimate gives [37]\n\u0393sph = 108 \u03b1s5 T 4\n\n(11)\n\nOn the other hand, there are indications that, away from the asymptotically weak coupling regime, the relevant time scale for the soft modes is (g 2 T )\u22121 [46]. Should this be\nthe case, the numerical estimate [37] should be re-interpreted to give\n\u0393sph \u2248 8\u03b1s4 T 4 .\n\n(12)\n\nIn the following, we will use both estimates.\nFor a hot plasma (without dynamical fermions) the potential is periodic and one\ngenerates topological charge via a random walk. One has\nh\u2206Q25 i =\n4\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03c4\n\nd4 x \u0393sph ,\n\nBoost invariance may still be preserved when one averages over events.\n\n10\n\n(13)\n\n\fwhere d4 x = d2 xt \u03c4 d\u03c4 d\u03b7. In an expanding boost invariant plasma, the temperature\ndecreases with time. For an isentropic expansion [39] one has T \u221d \u03c4 \u22121/3 . More precisely,\n\"\n\n90 dS 1 1\nT =\n4\u03c0 2 d\u03b7 L2 gd \u03c4\n\n#1/3\n\n,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere gd is the degeneracy factor and dS/d\u03b7 is the entropy per unit rapidity. From\nEq. 13 and Eq. 14, we obtain\ndh\u2206Q25 i\n= 1.5A \u03b1sn\nd\u03b7\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c4f\nL\n\n\u00132/3 \"\n\ndS 1 90\nd\u03b7 gd 4\u03c0 2\n\n#4/3\n\n,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere A and n are correspond to the different coefficient and power respectively in\nthe two sphaleron transition rates. At RHIC energies, dS/d\u03b7 \u223c 3.6 \u00d7 1000, \u03b1s \u223c 0.3,\n\u03c4f \u2248 L \u223c 10 fm, gd = 16. Then from the sphaleron transition rate in Eq. 11, and from\nEq. 15, we find for an expanding plasma,\n(1)\n\ndh\u2206Q5 iRM S\ndh\u2206Q25 i(1)\n|RHIC \u2248 1600 ;\n|RHIC \u2248 40 .\nd\u03b7\nd\u03b7\n\n(16)\n\nHere RMS denotes root mean square. Similarly, for the sphaleron transition rate in\nEq. 12, and Eq. 15, we have\n(2)\n\ndh\u2206Q25 i(2)\ndh\u2206Q5 iRM S\n|RHIC \u2248 400 ;\n|RHIC \u2248 20 .\nd\u03b7\nd\u03b7\n\n(17)\n\nThough these estimates of the topological charge generated by sphaleron transitions differ\nfrom each other they both are significantly larger than the topological charge squared\nobtained from boost invariant classical fields at RHIC (and LHC). In this paper, we\nhave considered the case of pure gluodynamics; the effects due to dynamical fermions\nhad been addressed in Refs. [40, 41, 43].\nWe now come to the phenomenological implications of our results. As discussed\npreviously, the likelihood of long-lived P and CP violating metastable states in heavy\nion collisions [1, 2] depends sensitively on the coefficient a of the anomaly term in the\nVVW Lagrangian. This coefficient is proportional to the topological susceptibility. The\nlikelihood of metastable states is greater for smaller values of a. Lattice and large Nc\ncalculations suggest that the topological susceptibility is indeed small for T > Tc The\nprevious estimates did not include the possibility of contributions from fluctuations in\nclassical fields or from sphaleron transitions. A difficult problem is how to convert\nthe estimates for generating non-zero topological charge into one for P and CP odd\nasymmetries for measured pions 5 . We will not address this problem directly here.\nInstead, since the quantity h\u03bd 2 i that we compute here is closely related to the topological\nsusceptibility, we can relate our estimate to those of Refs. [1, 2]. Our estimates here\n5\n~ *S\n~ coupling, invariants resulting from the coupling\nWe speculate that one may construct, akin to L\nof the vorticity of CS number to that of the vorticity of collective flow in an expanding plasma.\n\n11\n\n\fsuggest that the contribution to a from classical fields is small and would not therefore\naffect the estimate of Ref. [2]. On the other hand, the contribution from sphaleron\ntransitions might be potentially large. Thus if the RHIC experiments see a large P and\nCP violating effect, it may also be due to sphalerons [35].\nOur results depend on the strong boost invariance assumption, namely, each event\nis boost invariant. At central rapidities, the measured spectra look boost invariant [49]\non average. However, what is relevant to our assumption is the requirement that the\nspectra are boost invariant on an event by event basis. One way to ensure this is to\ncompute the standard deviation from strict boost invariance in one unit of rapidity\nabout mid-rapidity and check if it is small. Such studies are underway but no conclusive\nresults have been published yet [50]. As one goes to larger rapidities, the boost invariance\nassumption breaks down. The no-go theorem forbidding sphaleron transitions is violated\nand one may therefore see larger effects at non-central rapidities (in the P and CP odd\nobservables currently being investigated) due to sphaleron transitions. It will be very\ninteresting to see if this prediction can be tested in the on-going experiments at RHIC.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Dietrich B\u00f6deker, Greg Carter, Yuri Kovchegov, Eugene Levin, Larry McLerran, Emil Mottola, Rob Pisarski, Mikhail Shaposhnikov and Edward Shuryak for useful discussions.
