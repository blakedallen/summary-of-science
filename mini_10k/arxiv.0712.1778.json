This phase is\nproduced in the initial stages of a collision where a high density \u03c1 and temperature T are\nproduced. A heavy ion collision then proceeds through a subsequent expansion to lower\n\u03c1 and T where the colored quarks and anti-quarks form isolated colorless objects which\nare the well known particles whose properties are tabulated in ref[1]. Isospin plays an\nimportant role in the classification of these particles [1,2]. A discussion of its properties\nand consequences in relativistic heavy ion collisions seems useful. Isospin has also been\nused in the study of medium energy heavy ion collisions[3]. Ref.[3] contains a series of\nreprints illustrating its importance. In low energy nuclear physics, the isospin symmetries\nhave proven to be very useful in the classification of nuclear levels. Isospin symmetries\nare broken by Coulomb interactions. Part of this paper explores a parallel with this\nmultiplet structure and it's breaking by Coulomb interactions where the Coulomb\ninteraction is now replaced with the electrostatic \u03bcQ . Systems with large isospin excess\n\nwill be explored in future RIA experiments and at FAIR [4] .The extension of isospin\nsymmetry for strongly interacting particles to the weak sector involves weak isospin I ZW\nwhich is a fundamental symmetry of the standard model with very important\nconsequences [2]. I ZW is also given by a Gell-Mann/Nishijima expression.\nFor nuclei and particles made of u, d quarks only, the third component of isospin I Z ,\ncharge Q and baryon number B are related by 2 I Z = 2Q \u2212 B . For u, d, and s quarks,\nstrangeness is incorporated into the connection between isospin and Q, B through the use\n\n\f)\n)\nof hypercharge Y = B + S (+charm C +bottom B + top T ; only B, S will be considered).\nThe Gell-Mann/Nishijima [2] equation is 2 I Z = 2Q \u2212 Y , a generalization of the previous\nexpression 2 I Z = 2Q \u2212 B . In the Qg phase 2 I Z = U \u2212 D = ( N u \u2212 N u ) \u2212 ( N d \u2212 N d ) ,\n\nwhere N j ( j = u , d , u , d ) are the number of up, down quarks and anti-quarks. In a flavor\nunlocked or flavor uncorrelated Qg phase the correlation of isospin I Z with S = N S \u2212 N S ,\n)\n)\nand also charm C , top T , bottom B , would vanish for any symmetric N = Z or\nasymmetric N \u2260 Z system with neutron number N and proton number Z . This may not be\nthe case in color flavor locked CFL phases [5] which may occur at high baryon chemical\npotential \u03bc B and low T . Here the study centers on the parts of phase space away from this\nregion and in particular regions explored by experiments such as those at RHIC/CERN.\nHowever, even in these regions, the chromoelectric plasma may have a more complicated\nstructure than an ideal plasma of quarks and gluons [6,7]. A I Z / S correlation can be used\nas a measure of flavor correlations in a non-ideal plasma and in CFL phases.\nAs a baseline for comparison the assumption will be made of uncorrelated flavors in\nthe Qg phase and the question that is addressed is: how large is this correlation in a\nhadron phase? To answer this question a statistical model in a grand canonical form will\nbe used. A grand canonical statistical approach has been shown to be a useful description\nof the hadron phase [8-10]. Previous studies [11,12,13,14] showed the importance of\nlooking at fluctuations and correlations as a probe of a phase transition.\nA parallel can also be drawn with a Zeeman splitting of different spin J Z levels in a\nmultiplet by an external magnetic field. Population of these levels in a system at finite\ntemperature T will differ by the Boltzmann factor in energy E ( J Z ) / T . In this paper an\n\"external ( N \u2212 Z ) field\" splits the population of the different members of the isospin\nmultiplet according to their I Z .This splitting arises from a Boltzmann factor in \u03bc Q / T\nwhere the charge chemical potential \u03bc Q is the systems response to this \"external field\".\n2. Statistical Model Analysis in a Hadron Phase\n2.1 General Results\nThe statistical model [8-10] assumes that equilibrium in the strongly interacting sector is\nestablished in a volume V and at a temperature T . In the grand canonical ensemble three\nchemical potentials appear in the expression for the particle yields < N i > which comes\nfrom the constraints of baryon number, charge and strangeness. The < N i > , in the nondegenerate limit, will be written here in a form which reads\n< N i >= ai x bi y qi z ( \u2212 si )\n\nAs an example, the particle \u2206+ + has < N \u2206+ + >= a\u2206+ + xy 2 . The anti-particle of \u2206+ + has\n< N \u2206+ + >= a \u2206+ + x \u22121 y \u22122 . The simple quark model restricts bi = \u00b11,0 , qi = \u00b12,\u00b11,0 , and\n\nsi = \u00b13,\u00b12,\u00b11,0 . The ai = g s (i )(V / 2\u03c0 2 )(mi / T ) 2 ( K 2 (mi / T ) ) with g s (i ) = 2 si + 1 and\nmass mi . The x \u2261 exp[ \u03bc B / T ] , y \u2261 exp[\u03bc Q / T ] and z \u2261 exp[\u2212 \u03bc S / T ] . The x, y, z are\ndetermined by constraints on net baryon number B , net charge Q and strangeness S :\n\n(1)\n\n\fB = N B \u2212 N B = \u03a3bI < N i > , Q = N Q+ \u2212 N Q \u2212 = \u03a3qi < N i > , S = N S + \u2212 N S \u2212 = \u03a3si < N i > .\nIn a heavy ion collision the net strangeness is zero, but correlations associated with\nS and some other quantity may not necessarily be zero. As an obvious example, the\ncorrelation of S with itself is not =0: < S 2 > \u2212 < S > 2 =< S 2 >\u2260 0 when strange particles\nare produced. Because total B, Q, S are each conserved so are any combinations of them\nsuch as hypercharge Y = B + S = \u03a3(bi + si ) < N i > and I Z or 2 I Z given by the GellMann/Nishijima result 2 I Z = 2Q \u2212 Y = \u03a3(2qi \u2212 bi \u2212 si ) < N i > = Z \u2212 N . The Y or\n2 I Z equation can also replace one of the three previous constraint equations to determine\nthe chemical potentials. As will be shown, the 2 I Z isospin equation is very useful for\ndetermining the electric chemical potential and the hypercharge equation is also useful in\nsome specific situations such as when \u039e, \u03a9 contributions are small.\nTo proceed, small mass differences between different charge states of the same particle\nwill be ignored. The ai is then the same for each I Z state of a given particle. Differences\nin < N i > between different charge states in an isospin multiplet will occur when y \u2260 1.\nContributions of excited states of a given particle can be added to the lowest mass\ncontribution so that ai \u2192 Ai . For instance, the number of \u03a3 like particles\n< \u03a3(1267) > + < \u03a3* (1378) >+... = A\u03a3 xz ( y + 1 + 1 / y ) where the new coefficient\nA\u03a3 = a (\u03a3(1267) ) + a(\u03a3* (1378) )... . The A\u03c0 will contain \u03c1 and AN has p, n, N * . Particles\nr\nare grouped according to baryon number, strangeness and isospin I with\nJ = {N , \u2206, \u039b, \u03a3, \u039e, \u03a9, \u03c0 , K } . Resonance decays following freeze out are discussed below .\n2.2 Coupled equations for x, y, z or the chemical potentials \u03bc B , \u03bc Q , \u03bc S . Connection of I Z & \u03bc Q .\n2.2a General expressions\nThe B = N B \u2212 N B constraint and S constraint equations in ( x, y, z ) variables are\n\nB = \u2211 bJ AJ x bJ z \u2212 sJ\nJ\n\n\u2211y\nqJ\n\nqJ\n\n,\n\nS=\n\n\u2211s\nJ\n\nJ\n\nAJ x bJ z \u2212 sJ\n\n\u2211y\n\nqJ\n\n(2)\n\nqJ\n\nFor instance, \u2206 would make a contribution A\u2206 x( y 2 + y + 1 + y \u22121 ) . The 2 I Z will be used as\none of the three equations to determine the three unknowns x, y, z . Specifically,\n2 I Z = 2 I Z ( B) \u2212 2 I Z ( B )\n= AN x ( y \u2212 1) + A\u2206 x (3 y 2 + y \u2212 1 \u2212 3 y \u22121 ) + A\u03a3 xz (2 y + 0 y \u2212 2 y \u22121 ) + A\u039e xz 2 (\u2212 y \u22121 + 1)\n+ A\u03c0 (2 y + 0 y \u2212 2 y \u22121 ) + AK {z (\u2212 y \u22121 + 1) + (1 / z )( y \u2212 1)} \u2212 2 I Z ( B )\n\n(3)\n\nThe 2 I Z ( B ) is the anti-baryon part of Eq.(3) and is obtained from 2 I Z ( B) by taking the\nreciprocal of each x, y, z . The isosinglets \u039b0 , \u03a9 \u2212 do not contribute, nor do the I Z = 0\ncomponent of the isotriplets such as \u03a3 0 , \u03c0 0 , \u03c1 0 . The coefficients in front of y , when\ndivided by 2, are just the isospin I Z component of each charged state of each particle J .\nThe I Z equation explicitly shows that when I Z =0 then y = 1 . Specifically, every term in\n( ) parenthesis involving y in Eq.(3), such as (3 y 2 + y \u2212 1 \u2212 3 y \u22121 ) , is zero at y = 1 .\n\n\fAt y = 1 , the \u03bc Q = 0. This result is true only when the mass differences between members\nof an isospin multiplet are neglected. Mass splittings such as in m p \u2212 mn \u2248 \u22121.3MeV ,\n\nm\u03a3+ \u2212 m\u03a3\u2212 \u2248 8MeV , mK + \u2212 mK 0 \u2248 \u22124MeV give \u03bc Q \u2260 0 even when 2 I Z = Z \u2212 N = 0 . At\nlow T the rhs of Eq.(3) is dominated by n, p, \u2206, \u03c0 \u00b1 . The \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 have the same mass,\nand \u03b4m in the \u2206 multiplet is not known. Unfortunately, the mass splitting contribution\nfrom the \u2206 isospin multiplet could be the largest-see the factor of 10 in Eq.(4) below\nwhich arises from spin and isospin effects. Thus an estimate of \u03b4m contributions would\nbe unreliable. The \u03bc Q = m p \u2212 mn \u2248 \u22121.3MeV for the ( n, p ) multiplet at I Z =0 is small\ncompared to results given below as in Eq.25 with ( N \u2212 Z ) / B ~ 0.2 and T ~ 120 MeV .\nFor S = 0 , 2 I Z = Z \u2212 N and I Z = 0 for symmetric N = Z systems. When N \u2260 Z , y \u2260 1 and\nthen the various 2 I Z charge states of a given multiplet have different < N i > .\nUsually \u03bc Q << T . As a result a lowest order expansion around y = 1 will be made and only\nlinear terms in \u03bc Q / T will be kept. This consequence is a statement of a \"weak external\nfield\" which leads to a simplifying linear relation \u03bc Q ~ Z \u2212 N . Namely, expanding\n\ny = exp( \u03bc Q / T ) = 1 + \u03bc Q / T in Eq.(3) gives\n\n\u03bcQ\nT\n\n=\n\nZ\u2212N\n1\n1\n1\n1\n( AN + 10 A\u2206 )( x + ) + 4 A\u03a3 ( xz + ) + A\u039e ( xz 2 + 2 ) + 4 A\u03c0 + AK ( z + )\nx\nxz\nxz\nz\n\n(4)\n\nThe numerical coefficients in front of each AJ are given by \u03a3 (2 qi \u2212 (bi + si ))qi with\n\n\u2206+ + , \u2206+ , \u22060 , \u2206\u2212 contributing 6,1,0,3, respectively. The large factor of 10 makes \u2206 important\nin \u03bc Q / T . In order to obtain \u03bc Q , x and z also have to be determined. The evaluation of\nx, z for I Z = 0 is given below. As a first approximation these values also apply\nwhen I Z \u2260 0 since \u03bc Q is small compared to \u03bc S , \u03bc B . Typical values for a temperature\nrange T ~100 MeV \u2192 170 MeV have \u03bc S ~ \u03bc B / 5 and for ( N \u2212 Z ) ~ 0.2 B \u03bc Q ~ \u2212 \u03bc B / 40 .\nThe \u03bc B has a behavior given in ref.[9] as \u03bc B = 80.85(T0 \u2212 T )1/ 2 MeV , T0 = 167 MeV by\nfitting the statistical model to various data. This type of behavior of \u03bc B versus T can also\narise in a Hagedorn model [15] with a density of excited states \u03c1 = D\u03c4 m \u2212\u03c4 exp( \u03b2 h m) ,\nwhere D\u03c4 is a constant and \u03b2 h =1/ T0 . The AJ ~ V ( y / m0 )\u03c4 \u22125 / 2 ( \u222b \u221ey (dxe \u2212 x / x (\u03c4 \u22123 / 2) ))\nwith y = (T0 \u2212 T )m0 / T0T . The m0 is the lowest mass of particles of type J .

See ref.[15,16] for further consequences of a Hagedorn model.\n2.2b Constraint equations at y=1.\nWhen y = 1 the constraint equations are as follows. The result for B is:\n\n\f1\n1\n1\n1\nB = (2 AN + 4 A\u2206 )( x \u2212 ) + ( A\u039b + 3 A\u03a3 )( xz \u2212 ) + 2 A\u039e ( xz 2 \u2212 2 ) + A\u03a9 ( xz 3 \u2212 3 )\nx\nxz\nxz\nxz\n\n(5)\n\nThe equation for \u2212 S is:\n\u2212 S = ( A\u039b + 3 A\u03a3 )( xz \u2212\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n) + 4 A\u039e ( xz 2 \u2212 2 ) + 3 A\u03a9 ( xz 3 \u2212 3 ) + 2 AK ( z \u2212 )\nxz\nxz\nxz\nz\n\n(6)\n\nThe hypercharge Y = B + S equation would read:\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\nY = (2 AN + 4 A\u2206 )( x \u2212 ) \u2212 2 A\u039e ( xz 2 \u2212 2 ) \u2212 2 A\u03a9 ( xz 3 \u2212 3 ) \u2212 2 AK ( z \u2212 )\nx\nxz\nxz\nz\n\n(7)\n\nThe unknowns x, z can be obtained by solving two of the three Eq. (5,6,7) or any other\ncombinations of them. When \u039e, \u03a9 can be neglected ( A\u039e , A\u03a9 are small compared to other\nterms) these equations simply considerably since higher order powers of\nz ( z 2 , z 3 ,1 / z 2 ,1 / z 3 ) are absent. Such solutions will be given below.\n2.3Isospin correlations in the Qg phase and hadron phase.\nIn the Qg phase the charge Q , baryon number B , strangeness S , hypercharge Y ,\nisospin I Z and a quantity LZ \u2261 2Q \u2212 B are given by\nQ=\n\n2\n1\n1\n2\n1\n1\n( Nu \u2212 Nu ) \u2212 ( N d \u2212 N d ) \u2212 (N s \u2212 N s ) \u2261 U \u2212 D + S\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n\n(8)\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nB = (Nu \u2212 Nu ) + (N d \u2212 N d ) + (N s \u2212 N s ) \u2261 U + D + S\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n\n(9)\n\nS = \u2212( N s \u2212 N s )\n\n(10)\n\n1\n1\n2\n1\n1\n2\nY = B + S = (Nu \u2212 Nu ) + (N d \u2212 N d ) \u2212 (N s \u2212 N s ) \u2261 U + D + S\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n\n(11)\n\n2 I Z = 2Q \u2212 Y = ( N u \u2212 N u ) \u2212 ( N d \u2212 N d ) \u2261 U \u2212 D\n\n(12)\n\nLZ \u2261 2Q \u2212 B = ( N u \u2212 N u ) \u2212 ( N d \u2212 N d ) \u2212 ( N s \u2212 N s ) \u2261 U \u2212 D + S\n\n(13)\n\nAs already mentioned, if flavors are uncorrelated, the correlation between isospin and\nstrangeness (and also charm C , topness T and bottomness B) is zero since I Z only\ninvolves up and down quarks and anti-quarks. Then < 2 I Z X > \u2212 < 2 I Z >< X >= 0\nwith X = S , C , T or B . The I Z / S correlation is thus a direct, simple measure of flavor\ncorrelations. Besides an I Z / S correlation discussed here, I Z correlations with baryon\nnumber B, charge Q , hypercharge Y differ in the Qg and hadron phase because the\n\n\ffundamental units of baryon number are \u00b1 1/3 and charge are \u00b1 1 / 3e,\u00b12 / 3e in the\nQg phase. This property was first recognized for charge fluctuations < Q 2 > \u2212 < Q > 2\n[11,12].. The isospin/baryon number correlation is determined by the result\n< 2 I Z B >= 1 / 3 < U 2 > \u22121 / 3 < D 2 > with < B > = 1 / 3 < U > +1 / 3 < D > since\n< S >= 0 , < 2 I Z >=< U > \u2212 < D > so that < 2 I Z >< B >= (1 / 3)(< U > 2 \u2212 < D > 2 ) . Thus\n< 2 I Z B > \u2212 < 2 I Z >< B > = 1 / 3(< U 2 > \u2212 < U > 2 ) \u2212 1 / 3(< D 2 > \u2212 < D > 2 ) vanishes only\nif N = Z . The < 2 I Z Y > \u2212 < 2 I Z >< Y > = 1 / 3(< U 2 > \u2212 < U > 2 ) \u2212 1 / 3(< D 2 > \u2212 < D > 2 ) .\nThe < 2 I Z Q > \u2212 < 2 I Z >< Q > = 2 / 3(< U 2 > \u2212 < U > 2 ) + 1 / 3(< D 2 > \u2212 < D > 2 ) doesn't\nvanish even in N = Z systems. When N = Z , < D 2 >=< U 2 > and < D >=< U > . The\nstudy of such correlations may give some insight into more complicated views of the Qg\nsystem [6,7].\nIn a hadron phase the I Z / S correlation is given by isospin splitting yields:\n\u2212 (< 2 I Z S > \u2212 < 2 I Z >< S >) = \u2212 < 2 I Z S >=\n\n(14)\n\n2 < (\u03a3 + \u2212 \u03a3 \u2212 ) + ( \u03a3 + \u2212 \u03a3 \u2212 ) > +2 < (\u039e 0 \u2212 \u039e \u2212 ) + ( \u039e 0 \u2212 \u039e \u2212 ) > + < ( K 0 \u2212 K \u2212 ) + ( K 0 \u2212 K + ) >\nwhere each < J > can include the lowest mass plus all excited states J * of that J .\nParticles like \u039b (1520) \u2192 N + K don't contribute directly to eq.(14) or indirectly through\ntheir resonance decay products by isospin conservation. Isospin conservation gives equal\nnumbers of K 0 and K \u2212 in the two branches p + K \u2212 and n + K 0 since the Clebsch-Gordon\ncoefficients are \u00b1 1 / 2 :\n/ \u039b (1520), I = 0, I Z = 0 >= (1 / 2 ) / p > / K \u2212 > \u2212(1 / 2 ) / n > / K 0 >\n\n(15)\n\nSimilar results also apply to decay of the \u03c6 meson. When I Z =0, y = 1 and < I Z S >=0.\nWhen I Z \u2260 0, < I Z S >\u2260 0. Letting y = 1 + \u03bcQ / T , then\n\u2212 < 2 I Z S > \u2248 ( \u03bc Q / T )[4(< \u03a3 + + \u03a3 + >) + 2(< \u039e \u2212 + \u039e \u2212 >)+ < K \u2212 > \u2212 < K + >]\n\n(16)\n\nThe \u03bc Q is given by Eq.(4). The value of \u2212 < 2 I W ,Z S > depends on x, z . First the I Z = 0\n\ny = 1 case will be considered to obtain x, z . The I Z \u2260 0 can be built on this solution by\nsuccessive iterations.\n2.4 Simplified solutions in symmetric N=Z systems where isospin I Z = 0 , y=1.\n2.4a Behavior when I Z = 0 and \u03bc S / T <<1 or z \u2248 1 .\nWhen \u03bc S / T << 1 , then z = exp(\u2212 \u03bc S / T ) \u2248 1 .

This quadratic equation for x can be easily solved, giving\nx = x(z ) which can be substituted into S = 0 , to find z straightforwardly.\n2.4b Behavior when I Z = 0 and A\u039e and A\u03a9 are neglected\nWhen \u039e, \u03a9 are neglected, the relation between \u03bc S / T , \u03bc B / T is now\ntanh( \u03bc S / T ) = sinh( \u03bc B / T )\n\n1( A\u039b + (3 A\u03a3 ))\n1 (2 AK ) + cosh( \u03bc B / T )[12 ( A\u039b + (3 A\u03a3 ))]\n2\n\n(21)\n\nUsing Y = (2 AN + 4 A\u2206 )2 sinh( \u03bc B / T ) + 2 AK 2 sinh( \u03bc S / T ) results in:\n\n\u03bc\nB\n= sinh( B )(2 AN + 4 A\u2206 +\n2\nT\n\n2 AK ( A\u039b + 3 A\u03a3 )\n) (22)\n8 AK ( A\u039b + 3 A\u03a3 )\n2 \u03bcB\n(2 AK + A\u039b + 3 A\u03a3 ) 1 +\nsinh ( )\n(2 AK + A\u039b + 3 A\u03a3 ) 2\n2T\n\nFor large \u03bc B / T , cosh( \u03bc B / T ) and sinh( \u03bc B / T ) \u2192 exp( \u03bc B / T ) /2 and Eq.(21) is\n\n\f2m\u039b3 / 2 e \u2212 m\u039b / T + 6m\u03a33 / 2 e \u2212 m\u03a3 / T\n1\nexp(2 \u03bc S / T ) = 2 \u2248 1+ exp(\u03bc B / T )\nz\n2mK3 / 2 e \u2212mK / T\n\n(23)\n\nWhen y = 1 , K + / K \u2212 = exp(2 \u03bc S / T ). At low T where the \u03a3 term is small compared to\nthe \u039b contribution and where the 1 term is small also, the K + / K \u2212 ratio is determined by\n\nK + / K \u2212 = exp(\u03bc B / T )\n\n2m\u039b3 / 2 e \u2212 m\u039b / T m\u039b3 / 2\nexp((\u03bc B \u2212 m\u039b + mK ) / T )\n=\n2mK3 / 2 e \u2212mK / T mK3 / 2\n\n(24)\n\nThe K + / K \u2212 ratio can also be used to discuss the role of dropping masses [17] which\nleads to an enhancement of this ratio. The ratio involves the exponential factor in\n(( \u03bc B \u2212 m\u039b + mK ) / T ) which is sensitive to mass shifts.\n2.5 Estimates of \u2212 < 2 I Z S > from an \"external field'\nTypical collisions at RHIC are Pb + Pb which lead to large neutron excesses amongst the\nparticipants with ( N \u2212 Z ) / B ~ 0.2 . To a good approximation (~1 % error at T=120Mev):\n\n\u03bc Q / T \u2248 [( Z \u2212 N ) / B][2 + 4 A\u2206 / AN ] /[1 + 10 A\u2206 / AN + 4 A\u03c0 /( AN ( x + 1 / x))]\n~ [( Z \u2212 N ) / B ]\n\n(25)\n\nIn this approximation the hyperon and strange meson contributions ( A\u03a3 , A\u039e , AK ) are\nsmall compared to AN , A\u2206 , A\u03c0 in eq.(4) and corresponding, the hyperons are neglected in\nthe baryon constraint equation. Under these conditions \u03bc Q has the simple form just given.\nAt T = 120 MeV , \u03bc B ~600 MeV -see for example the experimental analysis of ref[9] and\nthe theoretical discussion in ref[15] based on a Hagedorn spectrum of states. The\nassociated \u03bc S = 118MeV and z=.3735 from Eq.(21). Including \u039e, \u03a9 gives z = .355\nand \u03bc S = 124MeV . The \u039e, \u03a9 lower z and slightly enhance \u03bc S . At higher temperatures\nthe enhancement from \u039e, \u03a9 is larger since the population of \u039e, \u03a9 increases with\ntemperature due to the Boltzmann factors exp(\u2212 m / T ) . The \u03bc Q = \u221214.5MeV for\n\n( N \u2212 Z ) / B = 0.2 . At a higher temperatue \u03bc B , \u03bc S and the magnitude of \u03bc Q decrease. For\nexample at T = 150 MeV , \u03bc B \u2248 300 MeV , z \u2248 .682 and \u03bc S \u2248 57 MeV , \u03bc Q \u2248 \u22128.5MeV .\nThe value of \u03bc Q is closely connected to \u03bc B and ( N \u2212 Z ) / B through a scaling relation that\nreads\n\n\u03bcQ \u2248 \u2212\n\nN \u2212 Z \u03bcB\nB\n8\n\nThe \u03bc S , \u03bc B scaling relation is \u03bc S \u2248 \u03bc B / 5 over a wide range of temperatures that run\nfrom T \u2248 100 MeV \u2192 T0 \u2248 167 MeV . The slope 1 / 5 in this linear scaling relation is\ndetermined by the strangeness in hyperons to the strangeness fluctuation in strange\n\n(26)\n\n\fmesons and hyperons as given by eq.(18) for temperatures T \u2248 T0 .\nOnce the chemical potentials are determined the < 2 I Z S > correlation follows from\nresults given in subsect.2.3 The < 2 I Z S > \u2248 0.018 ( N \u2212 Z ) at T = 120 MeV and\n< 2 I Z S > =0. 021( N \u2212 Z ) for T = 150 MeV . The numerical prefactors, 0.018\nfor T = 120 MeV and 0.021 for T = 150 MeV show a slightly increasing temperature\ndependence. While these coefficients, .018 and .021, are small, the < 2 I Z S > is obtained\nby multiplying them by ( N \u2212 Z ) = 0.2 B for the example considered here. By contrast, in\na flavor uncorrelated Qg phase < 2 I Z S > is identically=0. A heavy ion collision evolves\nthrough an expansion from a high density, high temperature Qg phase to a lower density\nand lower temperatures hadron phase where the colored quarks and anti-quarks form\nisolated colorless particles following the QCD phase transition back to the observable\nhadrons. Flavors become correlated since < 2 I Z S > \u2260 0 in the hadron phase for\nN \u2260 Z systems. The isospin strangeness correlation in the hadron phase is determined by\nthe electrostatic chemical potential which splits the population of the isospin carrying\nhyperons \u03a3, \u039e and anti-hyperons \u03a3, \u039e ,and strange mesons K 0 , K + and K 0 , K \u2212 . This\nelectrostatic chemical potential breaks the isospin symmetry of the system and produces\nthe correlation < 2 I Z S > .\n2.6 Susceptibilities and lattice calculations\nCorrelations and fluctuations can also be related to susceptibilities . Specifically, the\nB / S correlation defined in [14] as C\u02c6 BS = \u22123(< BS > \u2212 < B >< S > ) /(< S 2 > \u2212 < S > 2 ) was\nalso shown to be C\u02c6 = \u22123\u03c7 / \u03c7 . The off diagonal baryon/strangeness susceptibility\nBS\n\nBS\n\nSS\n\n\u03c7 BS and diagonal strangeness susceptibility \u03c7 SS are just derivatives of the grand\nr\npotential \u03a9 and in general the relation reads \u03c7 JK = (\u22121 / V )\u2202 2 \u03a9(V , T , \u03bc ) /(\u2202\u03bc j \u2202\u03bc k ) . In\nturn, the \u0108BS can be related to basic quark flavor susceptibilities of u, d , s [13].\nSpecifically, using the fact that mean flavor densities vanish at zero chemical potential,\nthe C\u02c6 BS = 1 + ( \u03c7 us + \u03c7 ds ) / \u03c7 ss . Lattice calculations such as those in ref [18] and ref[19]\ngive some preliminary results on quark susceptibilitie and flavor correlations. In\nparticular, ( \u03c7 us + \u03c7 ds ) / \u03c7 ss =0.00(3)/.53(1) from the results of ref[19,13] showing that\nflavors are uncorrelated. This result of uncorrelated flavors was assumed in this present\nwork on isospin/ strangeness correlations. The analysis of ref[13] gives a lattice\njustification for such an assumption. In particular, the analog of \u0108BS is\nC\u02c6\n\u2261< 2 I S > / < S 2 >= ( \u03c7 \u2212 \u03c7 ) / \u03c7 .\n2I zS\n\nZ\n\nus\n\nud\n\nss\n\nSummary and Conclusions\nThis paper explored the role of isospin in relativistic heavy ion collisions using the\n) )\nGell-Mann/Nishijima formula 2 I Z = 2Q \u2212 ( B + S + C + B + T ) . In particular an isospinstrangeness correlation is discussed. In a quark model of u, d , s , c, b, t quarks, the\n2 I Z = ( N u \u2212 N u ) \u2212 ( N d \u2212 N d ) and involves only the u, d quarks. The s, c, b, t each has\n\nisospin 0. For a heavy ion collision net S = 0 and net 2 I Z = ( Z \u2212 N ) . In a flavor\n) )\nuncorrelated phase, a correlation between I Z and either S , C , B orT would vanish. Thus, a\n\n\fnon-vanishing < I Z S > is a simple, direct measure of flavor correlations. With ever\nimproving lattice calculations, the degree of flavor correlations above the QCD transition\ncan be determined. Detailed calculations of some of the consequences of isospin\nsymmetry in the hadron phase were presented using a statistical model. Properties of I Z ,\n\u03bc Q and < I Z S > in this phase were developed. As an example, in a hadron phase an I Z / S\ncorrelation exists when \u03bc Q \u2260 0 , even when S = 0. An analogy was drawn with a Zeeman\nsplitting of a spin multiplet ( J Z = \u2212 J ,.., J ) in a magnetic field. In this analogy the\n\"external field\" is the neutron (or proton) excess N \u2212 Z and the Boltzmann factor\nexp[\u2212 E ( J Z ) / T ] is replaced with exp ( \u03bc Q / T ) . Expressions are developed, such\nEq.(14,16) which can be used to obtain this correlation directly from experimentally\ndetermined yields of strange particles. The dependence of \u03bc Q on ( N \u2212 Z ) can be\ndetermined experimentally by varying Z and N . The I Z / S correlation is a useful method\nof distinguishing the two phases if a fast expansion of the Qg freezes in the correlations.\nThis fast expansion assumption was the basis for the usefulness of charge fluctuations.\nExperiments looking for charge fluctuations can be found in ref. [20-23]. This scenario\nshould be contrasted with a situation in which the hadrons form a thermalized medium at\nthe end of the fireball expansion. In this latter situation the thermalized system will have\nno memory of any prior path. Then information about the Qg phase is lost.\nThe behavior of \u03bc B , \u03bc S , \u03bc Q is also important for understanding the complete phase\ndiagram of charged, strange, baryon rich hadronic matter. The Gell-Mann/Nishijima\nformula was shown to be very useful in such a study. Simple analytic expressions or a\nsimple procedure for obtaining these three chemical potentials were given. The \u03bc Q / T\nbehavior of Eq.(4) gave a linear relation \u03bc Q ~ ( Z \u2212 N ) arising from a response to a \"weak\nexternal field\". The constant between \u03bc Q and ( Z \u2212 N ) determines the degree of flavor\nmixing. This constant involves the isospin doublets like n,p, the isospin triplets such as\n\u03a3 + , \u03a3 0 , \u03a3 \u2212 or \u03c0 + , \u03c0 0 , \u03c0 \u2212 and the isospin quartets - \u2206+ + , \u2206+ , \u22060 , \u2206\u2212 .\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported in part by the DOE grant number DE-FG02-96ER-40987.\nReferences\n[1] Review of Particle Physics, Eur.
