The\ndependence of the emitted THz waveform on the energy and polarization of the optical pulse is\nconsistent with the optical rectification mechanism of THz emission. The THz emission provides\na sensitive probe of the electric polarization state of BiFeO3 , enabling applications in ferroelectric memories and ferroelectric domain imaging. We also report room-temperature THz optical\nconstants of BiFeO3 .\n\n1\n\n\fMultiferroic BiFeO3 (BFO) offers the possibility of electrical manipulation of its magnetic state, which can be used in devices such as electrically-controlled magnetic memory\nelements1,2 . At room temperature, single-crystalline BFO is found in a G-type antiferromagnetic state (TN =640 K) with a modulated cycloidal spin structure with a long modulation\nperiod of \u223c620 \u00c53,4,5,6 . The material is also a robust ferroelectric with a high Curie temperature TC of 1,103 K and large ferroelectric polarization of \u223c100 \u03bcC/cm27 . Nonlinear\noptics plays an important role in characterization of ferroelectrics, as the lack of inversion\nsymmetry in ferroelectric crystals results in the presence of strong second-order nonlinearities; nonlinear optics is also an important area for ferroelectric applications, along with\ntransducers and data storage. Linear and nonlinear optical properties of BFO have been\nreported8,9,10,11 . Recently, it has been proposed that terahertz (THz) radiation from BFO\nthin films can be used in ferroelectric domain imaging and optical readout of the state of ferroelectric memories12,13,14 . In that work, the THz wave was generated by ulrafast modulation\nof ferroelectric polarization when charge carriers were injected in the film by a femtosecond\nlaser pulse.\nIn this Letter, we report coherent generation of THz waveforms by femtosecond 800-nm\noptical pulses from ferroelectric BFO in reflection and transmission geometries and also\nprovide the THz-frequency optical constants of BFO. The THz wave is generated via optical\nrectification that relies on the second-order nonlinearity. The amplitude of the THz wave\ndetected in the time-domain depends on the direction of the ferroelectric dipole in the BFO\ncrystal. In contrast, a measurement of the intensity of the second-harmonic light does\nnot provide this information10,15 . Thus, THz emission provides a sensitive probe of the\npolarization state of the BFO crystals. The presented work was performed on a high-quality\nsingle ferroelectric domain crystal of BFO, which is evidenced by the pronounced polarization\ndependence of both the optical rectification and the measured THz optical constants. Such\nhigh-quality crystals are indispensable for the reliable characterization of the basic material\nproperties6,16 .\nFor this work, bulk single ferroelectric domain BFO crystal was grown using a Bi2 O3 flux.\nThe ferroelectric phase possesses the rhombohedral R3c structure that can be obtained\nby a slight elongation of the pseudocubic perovskite unit cell along the (111) direction.\nOur measurements were performed at room temperature on a 0.22 mm thick (001)cubic oriented crystal mounted on a 3-mm diameter aperture. Coherent THz transients were\n2\n\n\fgenerated upon illumination of the crystal by 800-nm femtosecond pump pulses provided\nby Ti:Sapphire regenerative amplifier operating at 1 kHz and focused to a 2-mm diameter\nspot. The maximum pump power of 150 mW used in these measurements corresponds to\nthe fluence of 4.8 mJ/cm2 . The THz transients emitted from BFO were focused on a [110]oriented ZnTe crystal for coherent detection via electro-optic sampling17,18 . The THz optical\nconstants of the BFO crystal were measured in transmission in a time-domain spectroscopy\nsystem that uses photoconductive antennas for THz generation and detection19 .\nFigure 1 shows the geometry of THz generation measurement in BFO. The incident\nfemtosecond pump pulses are polarized in the horizontal x-z plane. The ferroelectric dipole\nmoment in BFO points along the long diagonal of the distorted perovskite structure and\nmakes a 35o angle with the surface of our crystal. Figure 1 displays the THz transients\nemitted from the crystal in transmission and reflection geometries. Both in transmission\nand reflection, the main THz pulse is followed by the Fabry-P\u00e9rot (or etalon) reflection\nwithin the sample.\nWhen a lightwave of frequency \u03c9 is incident on a crystal with a second-order optical\nnonlinearity \u03c7(2) , the polarization induced by the lightwave contains the nonlinear part\nP N L = \u03c7(2) (cos \u03c9t)2 = 1/2\u03c7(2) (1 + cos 2\u03c9) = P N L (0) + P N L (2\u03c9). The latter term in\nthe last expression describes the second harmonic generation. The former term describes\na zero-frequency polarization, which is truly a constant (DC) polarization induced in the\ncrystal when the incident lightwave is a sinusoidal field of infinite duration. Induction of DC\npolarization due to the second-order nonlinearity is known as optical rectification. When\nthe incident lightwave is a 100-fs-long pulse (Fig. 1a), the induced P N L (0) only exists for the\nduration of the pulse and represents a time-varying electric dipole P (t). This time-dependent\ndipole emits a THz electromagnetic wave ET Hz (t) \u223c \u2202 2 P (t)/\u2202t2 . To confirm that optical\nrectification is responsible for the observed THz emission, we measure the dependence of the\nemitted THz amplitude on the angle between the [110]cubic crystallographic direction and\nthe y axis while rotating the crystal about its normal (Fig. 1a). The angular dependence\nof the emitted THz field is consistent with the optical rectification mechanism. We model\n(2)\n\nthe induced second order THz-frequency polarization Pi = \u03c7ijk Ej (\u03c9)Ek (\u03c9) using the set\nof nonlinear optical constants of BFO films found by Kumar et al10 . The emitted THz\nfield ET Hz (t) has the same angular dependence as the induced P (t). The solid line in\nFig. 2 represents the calculated induced polarization and shows excellent agreement with\n3\n\n\fthe measured THz field amplitude. The meaning of the negative THz amplitude is illustrated\nin the inset of Fig 2. The optical rectification mechanism of the THz emission is supported\nfurther by the linear dependence of the THz field amplitude on the pump power (inset of\nFig. 3).\nThe ferroelectric axis of BFO can be along any of the four long diagonals of the pseudocubic unit cell (Fig. 1a). Correspondingly, eight different ferroelectric domains are possible in\nthe crystal. The pronounced angular dependence of THz emission (Fig. 2) demonstrates that\nour crystal predominantly consists of a single ferroelectric domain, which is a result of crystal growth below the Curie temperature. The single-domain nature of these millimeter-sized\ncrystals was confirmed independently by neutron diffraction4,5 .\nA different mechanism for THz emission from BFO thin films was described by Takahashi\net al12,13,14 . In their work, the emission is due to the injection of photoexcited charge carriers\nand ultrafast modulation of spontaneous polarization Pf . In our measurements, similar\nprocesses involving the injection of photocarriers can be ruled out because the energy of our\n800 nm, 1.5 eV pump pulses is lower than the direct optical gap of BFO. To confirm this,\nwe carried out optical-pump THz-probe study of the BFO crystal, in which no changes to\nthe THz optical constants were induced by the 800-nm pump pulses. The absence of THz\nconductivity modulation indicates that no free carriers are created by the 800-nm light20 . In\ncontrast, Takahashi et al used 400-nm pump light in their work to inject the photocarriers.\nOur BFO crystal is opaque to the 800-nm light, even though this photon energy is lower\nthan the measured bandgap. The residual absorption is most likely due to a certain level of\npresent defects. The same defects are expected to act as traps for the few carries that are\ncreated by the absorption. Thus, the residual absorption in our BFO crystal does not result\nin a measurable change in THz conductivity.\nWe determine the spectral content of THz pulses emitted from BFO by taking a Fourier\ntransform of the measured time-domain transients and compare it to THz emission from\n0.5-mm thick [110]-oriented ZnTe crystal (Fig. 3). The THz spectrum emitted from BFO in\nreflection is very similar to that of the emission from ZnTe, although the amplitude of ZnTe\nemission is approximately 25 times larger than that of BFO at the same pump power. The\ndiffering emission conditions in ZnTe and BFO, i.e., different crystal thicknesses, emission\ndirection and phase matching, suggest that in both cases the \u223c 2.5 THz bandwidth may\nbe limited by the frequency response of the electro-optic-sampling THz detector used in the\n4\n\n\fmeasurement.\nThe spectrum of the THz pulse emitted from BFO in transmission is considerably narrower than the spectrum of the pulse emitted in reflection (Fig. 3; in this Figure all spectra\nare normalized by the maximum amplitude of the ZnTe spectrum). We attribute this to\nthe absorption of the higher frequencies in the THz pulse by BFO as the pulse propagates\nthrough the crystal. We point out that even though the optical absorption at 800 nm is\nnegligible compared to the above-bandgap absorption in BFO, the residual absorption is\nsufficiently strong to prevent the 800-nm light from propagating far into the BFO crystal.\nWe estimate that the penetration depth of the 800-nm light is about 10 \u03bcm, which is only a\nsmall fraction of the total 220 \u03bcm thickness of our BFO crystal. (Our BFO crystal is completely opaque to the eye. A different BFO crystal became transparent after we polished\nit down to 10 \u03bcm thickness.) Therefore, the THz wave is emitted in a thin surface layer of\nour BFO crystal and then propagates through and is absorbed by the remaining portion of\nthe crystal. To confirm this, we measured THz absorption in BFO (upper panel of Fig. 4)\nand found that the crystal is indeed opaque above \u223c 1.6 THz for the light polarized along\nthe ferroelectric polarization Pf . The THz optical constants extracted from the measurement (lower panel of Fig. 4) allow an estimate of the THz pulse amplitude emitted from the\n10- \u03bcm-thick layer in which the pump pulse is absorbed. Thus calculated THz amplitude\nis comparable to the measured amplitude of the THz pulse emitted in reflection. The two\namplitudes are expected to be the same because phase matching is unimportant in a sufficiently thin crystal. More evidence for THz emission occurring in a thin surface layer of the\ncrystal is provided by the broadened Fabry-P\u00e9rot reflection of the main THz pulse detected\nin reflection (Fig. 1). The time-domain width of the Fabry-P\u00e9rot pulse is the same as that\nof the main transmitted THz pulse, which means that the main reflected pulse is narrow\nin the time domain and has a much broader spectrum in the frequency domain because it\ndoes not traverse an appreciable thickness of BFO material and therefore does not lose the\nhigh-frequency components in its spectrum.\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate the emission of coherent THz radiation from BFO due\nto optical rectification of \u223c 100 fs 800-nm pump pulses both in reflection and transmission geometries. This mechanism of THz emission is different from the previously reported\nemission via ultrafast modulation of the spontaneous ferroelectric polarization12,13,14 . The\npotential applications of coherent THz emission include ferroelectric domain imaging and\n5\n\n\fnon-destructive readout of the state of ferroelectric memory elements. Since optical rectification does not require the absorption of the pump pulse, our demonstration opens the\ndoor for future studies using pump wavelengths longer that the 442-nm bandgap of BFO, including the important 1.3 \u03bcm and 1.55 \u03bcm telecommunications wavelengths. We also report\nroom-temperature THz-frequency optical constants of BFO, which will be indispensable in\nmodeling THz emission and propagation in those devices.\nWe would like to thank Kiyong Kim for useful discussions.
