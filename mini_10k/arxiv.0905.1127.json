For appropriate model parameters, we observe a band-selective Mott transition at a\ncritical chemical potential, \u03bcc , corresponding to the solidification of the fermions in the first layer.\nThe growth of the effective mass on the metallic side (\u03bc < \u03bcc ) is cut off by a first order transition\nin which the first layer fermions drop out of the Luttinger volume and their spin degrees of freedom\nbecome locked in a spin singlet state. These results are obtained from a cluster dynamical mean-field\ncalculation on an eight-site cluster with a quantum Monte Carlo cluster solver.\n\nThe solidification of 3 He monolayers [1] has been interpreted as a density-driven Mott transition in which\nthe effective mass diverges [2, 3]. Below the critical density, the metallic phase corresponds to a nearly localized\nFermi liquid and, beyond the critical density, to a spindisordered solid. Recently, it has been possible to realize\nbilayers of 3 He [4] (atop a frozen 4 He substrate, itself\nadsorbed onto graphite) with the special property that\nthe second layer begins to form before the first has solidified. Since the first layer is close to a Mott transition, the\n3\nHe fermions in this layer are slow (i.e. heavy), whereas\nthose in the second layer are fast. This combination of\nfast and slow dynamics-corresponding to wide and narrow fermion conduction bands-is completely analogous\nto the situation in electronic heavy fermion materials, albeit without the complication of crystal field and spin\norbit effects.\nAccording to this picture, prior to solidification of the\nfirst layer, one expects an enhanced effective mass and a\nLuttinger volume that counts both the first- and secondlayer populations. Moreover, one naively anticipates that\nfurther 3 He deposition will eventually cause the effective\nmass to diverge. In experiment, the effective mass is\nindeed observed to increase as a function of the total\n3\nHe concentration, but its growth is interrupted by an\nintervening phase [4] in which the first 3 He layer is a spindisordered insulator, decoupled from the second layer.\nThe motivation for this Letter is to consider a simple\nlattice model that goes a good way toward reproducing\nthe aforementioned experimental situation. As shown in\nFigs. 1(a) and 1(b), we adopt a stacking of billiard balls\n3\nmodeling of bilayer\nHe on a triangular lattice defined\n\u221a\nby a1 = (1/2, 3/2, 0) and a2 = (1, 0, 0). Each unit cell\naccounts for two 3 He positions, rf = 0 and rc = 23 a1 \u2212\n1\n3 a2 + (0, 0, a3 ), measured relative to the lattice. Note\nthat this presupposes a particular stacking arrangement\nfor the second 3 He layer.\nOur model can be viewed as a honeycomb lattice whose\ninequivalent sites (corresponding to 3 He positions in the\nupper and lower layers) are populated by two species\nof fermion, which we label c and f . The tight-binding\nparameters include a nearest-neighbour (interlayer) hopping V and next-nearest-neighbour (intralayer) hoppings\n\n(a)\n\n(c)\n\ntf\ntc\n\n2a1\n\na1\n\nV\n\na2\n(b)\n\nb1\n\n(d)\n\n\u039c\n\u039a\n\u0393\nb2\n\nFIG. 1: (a),(b) Stacking of billiard balls modeling of bilayer 3 He, top and side view, with the 4 He substrate shown in\nwhite.

Similar models (though ones with\na somewhat unrealistic direct layer stacking) have been\nconsidered for the description of bilayer 3 He in Refs. 5\nand 6 within a slave boson mean-field calculation. Here\nwe go one step further and perform calculations within\nthe cellular dynamical mean field theory (CDMFT) [7]\napproximation using a supercell defined by the lattice\nconstants Lc a1 and Lc a2 with Lc = 2. Since the original\nunit cell contains two orbitals, this amounts to a total\nof eight orbitals per supercell. The resulting single particle Green function, G(K, i\u03c9m ), is a 2L2c \u00d7 2L2c matrix\nwith crystal momentum K in the Brillouin zone of the\nsupercell lattice. The CDMFT calculation involves neglecting momentum conservation and thereby obtaining\na K-independent self-energy \u03a3(i\u03c9m ). This quantity is\nextracted from an Lc \u00d7 Lc cluster of unit cells embedded in a dynamical mean field that is determined selfconsistently. We have solved this cluster problem using\na standard Hirsch-Fye approach and have symmetrized\nthe cluster Green function to obtain the corresponding\nquantity on the lattice:\nG(k, i\u03c9m )\u03bc,\u03bd =\n\n1 X ik*(x\u03b1 \u2212x\u03b2 )\ne\nG(K, i\u03c9m )(\u03bc,\u03b1),(\u03bd,\u03b2) .\nL2c\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n(2)\nHere x\u03b1 denotes the unit cell positions within the supercell, \u03bc and \u03bd run over the c and f orbitals within each\nunit cell, and k and K differ by a reciprocal lattice vector of the supercell Bravais lattice. The rotation to real\nfrequencies was carried out with a stochastic analytical\ncontinuation technique [8, 9].\nWe consider the following model parameters: tc = tf =\nt, Uc /t = Uf /t = 12, V0 /t = 1/2, \u03b50c /t = 3 and \u03b50f /t = 0.\nWe have chosen large values of Uc and Uf to reflect the\ncontact repulsion of the 3 He atoms and to guarantee that\neach single layer is well within the Mott insulating phase\nat half-band filling [10]. These values of the Hubbard\ninteraction lead to low double occupancy, thus generating local moments. The difference \u03b50c \u2212 \u03b50f > 0 is a\ncrude accounting for the van der Waals forces (both 4 He\u2013\n\nHe and 3 He\u20133 He) that preferentially fill the first layer.\nFig. 2 plots the layer densities hn\u0302f i and hn\u0302c i as a function of the chemical potential, which controls the overall\n3\nHe concentration. Analysis of the temperature dependence of hn\u0302f i is consistent with a zero-temperature jump\nof this quantity at \u03bc = \u03bcc ' \u22121.8t. In contrast, hn\u0302c i\nincreases smoothly with the chemical potential. Since\n\u2202F\n\u2202\u03bc = hn\u0302c + n\u0302f i, the jump in the total fermionic density\nsignals a density-driven first order transition. In a canonical ensemble, states with total density lying within the\njump are phase separated. The first order nature of this\nphase transition can be confirmed explicitly on smaller\nfour-site clusters, which can be simulated at much lower\ntemperatures before the negative sign problem becomes\nunmanageable [11].\nThe nature of the distinct metallic phases on either\nside of the transition is best understood in terms of the\nsingle particle spectral function,\nA(k, \u03c9) = \u2212 Im Tr G(k, \u03c9),\n\n(3)\n\nplotted in Fig. 3. For \u03bc < \u03bcc , and as exemplified by\nthe data set at \u03bc = \u22122.5t, the low-energy coherent features of the spectral function compare favorably with a\nslave boson approximation leading to mass-renormalized,\nhybridized bands. This state has a Luttinger volume\nthat includes both f and c fermions, and the band with\nthe largest Fermi volume has dominant f character. As\na function of the chemical potential, the effective mass\nof the f band grows; beyond \u03bcc , the f band drops\nout of the low-energy physics altogether. This can be\nunderstood at the static mean field level by a conventional slave boson theory in competition with local singlet formation in the first layer. The transition is signaled by the appearance of an anomalous expectation\nP\n\u2020\nvalue \u2206ij \u223c (t2f /Uf ) \u03c3 hfi,\u03c3\nfj,\u03c3 i. The upper inset of\nFig. 3 shows the band structure that results when this\nsinglet order parameter has the configuration depicted in\nFig. 1(c).\nWe understand this transition to be of the bandselective Mott type, in which a half-filled band with dominant f and sub-dominant c character is gapped beyond\n\u03bcc . This interpretation is supported by the fact that, beyond \u03bcc , hn\u0302f i does not saturate to unity, as in the case\nof an orbital-selective Mott transition [16]. The data in\nFig. 3 show the typical Mott-Hubbard transfer of spectral\nweight from the upper band at \u03c9 \u223c 6t (\u03bc = \u22121.75t) down\nto the Fermi energy as a function of decreasing chemical\npotential [12]. In the generic Mott-Hubbard scenario,\ndoping occurs when the chemical potential reaches the\nlower Hubbard band, which in the present case is situated at roughly \u03c9 \u223c \u22126t for \u03bc = \u22121.75t. In the bandselective Mott transition, doping is provided by changing\nthe occupation of the ungapped band.\nTo accurately estimate the effective mass renormalization at \u03bc < \u03bcc , we consider the self-energy, \u03a3ff (k, \u03c9m ), as\ndefined by G\u22121\nff (k, i\u03c9m ) = i\u03c9m \u2212 \u03b5f (k) + \u03bc \u2212 \u03a3ff (k, \u03c9m ),\nwith the Green function taken from Eq. (2). Since at\n\n\f3\n\u03bc < \u03bcc the self-energy is dominated by its frequency dependence, the effective mass renormalization is very well\napproximated by the inverse quasiparticle residue,\n\n\u03c9m \u21920\n\nThis quantity is plotted in Fig. 4 for Fermi wave vectors of the f band along the \u0393\u2013M and K\u2013\u0393 directions in\nthe Brillouin zone. A monotonic increase of the effective\nmass is observed, but its divergence is preempted by the\nfirst order transition at \u03bc = \u03bcc .\nThe growth of the effective mass corresponds to a decrease of the coherence temperature, Tcoh , below which\nFermi liquid behavior manifests itself.

(5)\n\u03c7f (i\u03a9m ) = 2\nLc x 0\nBelow the coherence temperature, \u03c7f (i\u03a9m = 0) is expected to be temperature independent. On the other\nhand, in the temperature region Tcoh < T \u001c U , it\nshould exhibit Curie-Weiss behavior-the signature of local moment formation. Precisely this behavior is seen in\nFig. 5. As the chemical potential grows from \u03bc = \u22122.5t\nto \u03bc = \u22121.875t, the crossover temperature scale between the Curie-Weiss-like and temperature-independent\n\u03c7f (i\u03a9m = 0) tracks the decrease of the inverse effective mass and coherence temperature. Beyond the phase\ntransition, \u03bc = \u22121.75t > \u03bcc , only Curie-Weiss behavior\nis apparent in the considered temperature range.\nFig. 6 shows that the band-selective Mott transition is\nlinked to a sudden growth of the antiferromagnetic correlations between nearest-neighbor f fermions and to a\ndecrease in the intracell c-f spin-spin correlations. This\ndata supports the picture that, in the band-selective\nMott insulating phase, the f quasiparticles are bound\ninto spin singlets amongst themselves. The gapping of\nthe spin and charge degrees of freedom of the f quasiparticles at \u03bc > \u03bcc allows for the decoupling of f and c\nquasiparticles: a c quasiparticle at the Fermi level cannot\nscatter off an f quasiparticle due to the absence of phase\nspace.\nThe local dynamical spin structure factor,\nSf (\u03c9) = Im\n\n\u03c7f (\u03c9)\n,\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b2\u03c9\n\n(6)\n\n(see Fig. 6) shows a depletion of spectral weight at low\nenergies on both sides of the transition and a considerable sharpening of the line shape in the band-selective\n\n\f4\ndata within an itinerant fermion picture where the mass\nenhancement prior to the band-selective Mott transition\nis taken into account by a renormalization of the hybridization V and hopping tf as in a slave boson approach\n[5]. Following this modeling, the peak position in Sf (\u03c9),\nwhich we will denote by TS , is expected to track the\ncoherence temperature or, equivalently, the inverse effective mass. The quantity TS is plotted in Fig. 4 alongside\nZ(kf ) and confirms the above expectations to a good degree. At \u03bc > \u03bcc , Sf (\u03c9) should be interpreted within a\nlocalized f fermion picture, in which case the peak position is a measure of the excitation energy required to\nbreak the singlet state of the f fermions.\n\n1/\u03c7f (i\u03a9m = 0)\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n\u03bc = \u22122.5 t\n\u03bc = \u22122.0t\n\u03bc = \u22121.875 t\n\u03bc = \u22121.75 t\n\u03bc = \u22121.5 t\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\nT/t\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nFIG. 5: Inverse local spin susceptibility as a function of temperature for the Nc = 8 cluster.\n\n0\n\n8\n\u03bc = \u22121.75 t\n\u03bc = \u22121.875 t\n\u03bc = \u22122.5 t\n\n\u22120.005\n\u22120.01\n\u22120.015\n\n6\n\n(a)\n\n\u3008 Sfi\n\n\u22120.020\n\n*\n\nSci \u3009\n4\n\n0\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.6\n\n(c) Sf (\u03c9)\n\n2\n\n(b)\n\n\u3008Sfi *\n\n\u22122.5\n\nSfi+a1\u3009\n\u22122\n\n\u03bc/t\n\n\u22121.5\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n\u03c9/t\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFIG. 6: (a) Intracell spin-spin correlations between c and f\nfermions.

The band-selective Mott transition corresponds to a Kondo breakdown in which the f\nfermions drop out of the Luttinger volume. Within our\nmodel, it appears that this transition is first order: the\nreduction of the coherence temperature and the enhancement of the effective mass is interrupted by the formation\nof a spin gapped Mott insulating state of the f fermions.\nThe nature of this band-selective Mott insulating state\nis very dependent on the cluster topology. In this work,\nwe have considered only clusters with an even number\nof unit cells-thereby implicitly allowing for spin gapped\ninsulating states of the f fermions within the CDMFT\ncalculation. Despite the breaking of translation invariance inherent to the CDMFT, the Luttinger sum rule\nstill holds when formulated in the Brillouin zone of the\nsupercell Bravais lattice. We can only speculate as to the\nnature of this state when the cluster size diverges, but we\ncannot exclude the intriguing possibility that it smoothly\nconnects to fractionalized Fermi liquids [14, 15] with no\nlattice and spin symmetry breaking but a Luttinger volume encompassing only the c fermions.\nAcknowledgments.
