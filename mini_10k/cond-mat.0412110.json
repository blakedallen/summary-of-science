Surface induced layering is found for each elemental liquid metal. The surface\nstructure of the K-Na alloy resembles that of an elemental liquid metal. Surface segregation and a\nwetting film are found for Ga-Bi. Bi-In displays pair formation at the surface.\nPACS numbers: 61.25.Mv, 68.10.\u2013m, 61.10.\u2013i\n\n1\n\n\fI.\n\nLIQUID METALS AND SURFACE INDUCED ORDER\n\nLiquid metals (LM) are comprised of charged ion cores whose Coulomb interactions are\nscreened by a conduction electron sea. At the liquid-vapor interface, this screened Coulomb\npotential gives way to the weaker van der Waals interactions that prevail in the vapor. Since\nthe potential changes so substantially across the interface, the potential gradient is high,\nproducing a force that acts on the ions at the liquid surface as though they were packed\nagainst a hard wall. Analytic calculations and molecular dynamics simulations predict that\natoms at the LM surface are stratified in layers parallel to the interface1 . By contrast, a\nmonotonic density profile is predicted for the vapor interface of a nonmetallic liquid.\nObservation of surface layering in LM requires an experimental technique sensitive to\nthe surface-normal density profile that can resolve length scales of 2\u20133 \u00c5. Specular X-ray\nreflectivity provides the most direct probe of the surface normal structure. X-rays incident\non the liquid surface at an angle \u03b1 are scattered at the same angle within the reflection plane\ndefined by the incident beam and the surface normal (Fig. 1(a)). The reflected intensity is\ndirectly related to the surface normal density profile \u03c1\u0303(z):\n2\n\nR(qz ) \u221d qz\u22122 (\u2202 \u03c1\u0303(z)/\u2202z) exp(iqz z)dz .\n\n(1)\n\nSince \u2202 \u03c1\u0303(z)/\u2202z is nonzero only near the surface, x-ray reflectivity is sensitive to the surfacenormal structure and not to the structure of the bulk liquid. For example, surface layering\nwith a spacing d produces a quasi-Bragg peak in the reflectivity, centered at the surfacenormal momentum transfer qz = (4\u03c0/\u03bb) sin \u03b1 \u2248 2\u03c0/d2,3,4 .\nGrazing incidence diffraction (GID) is sensitive to the in-plane structure of the surface.\nThe in-plane momentum transfer qk is probed by varying the azimuthal angle 2\u03b8 at fixed \u03b1.\nThis geometry is surface sensitive when the incident angle \u03b1 is kept below the critical angle\nfor total external reflection, \u03b1c , thereby limiting the x-ray penetration depth5 .\nFor these structural studies it is essential to maintain a liquid metal surface that is flat\nand clean on an atomic scale. The sample is contained either in an ultra high vacuum\n(UHV) environment, or under a reducing atmosphere such as dry hydrogen gas, to prevent\noxidation. For low vapor pressure, UHV-compatible metals such as Ga, Bi, and In, argon\nion sputtering is possible, and this is the most reliable way to produce an atomically clean\nsurface 4 .\n2\n\n\fFIG. 1: (a) X-ray reflectivity geometry for the liquid metal, with layering of ions producing an\noscillatory density profile \u03c1(z). (b) X-ray reflectivity for liquid Hg (\u221235\u25e6 C, \u25e6), Ga (+25\u25e6 C) and In\n(+170\u25e6 C, \u25b3). Solid lines: calculated Fresnel reflectivity from a flat surface. Data for Ga and In\nare shifted for clarity.\n\n3\n\n\fSurface layering in elemental LM was first experimentally confirmed by synchrotron xray reflectivity measurements of liquid Hg3 and Ga4. Experiments on In6 and a number of\nalloys7,8,9,10 followed. Fig. 1(b) shows experimental reflectivities for three low melting point\nelemental LM. The principle deviation from the Fresnel reflectivity calculated for a perfectly\nflat metal surface (solid lines) is in the broad quasi-Bragg peak centered near qz = 2.2 \u00c5\u22121 .\nThese reflectivity profiles can be well described by layered density profiles decaying over\nseveral layers, shown schematically in Fig. 1(a).\n\nII.\n\nSURFACE STRUCTURE OF BINARY LIQUID ALLOYS\n\nIn binary alloys properties such as atomic size, surface tension, and electronic structure\ncan be varied and should affect the details of the surface structure, thus allowing a more\nsystematic understanding of surface layering. Also, since binary alloys form various ordered\nphases in the bulk, another interesting question arises: How does the alloy's bulk phase\nbehavior manifest itself at the surface, where the electronic structure, atomic coordination\nand local composition are different? This question has motivated a number of studies on\nalloys, which have found that in general, surface layering competes with the formation of\nmore complicated surface phases. For example, in miscible alloys the Gibbs adsorption\nrule predicts that the species having the lower surface energy will segregate at the surface.\nObservations on Ga-In9, Ga-Sn8 and Ga-Bi at low Bi concentrations7,10 have found that\nsurface segregation coexists with surface layering. In these alloys the first surface layer\nis almost entirely composed of the lower surface tension component (In, Sn or Bi). By\nthe second or third atomic layer, the bulk composition has been reached. In the following\nsections, we describe recent x-ray results from alloy surfaces which demonstrate a range of\ndifferent surface induced structural effects.\n\nA.\n\nK-Na\n\nAlkali metals have a simple electronic structure which can be described by ideal Fermi\nsurfaces, and are soluble in each other with only a weak tendency towards phase formation.\nSince alkali metals have a very low surface tension, surface fluctuations are enhanced. These\nproperties are expected to make the alkali metals' surface structures different from those\n\n4\n\n\fof the main group metals studied so far. Ideally alkali metals would be investigated under\nUHV conditions due to their high reactivity. However, at the melting point their high vapor\npressures precludes this. By contrast, the melting point of the eutectic K80 Na20 alloy is\nsufficiently low to allow UHV conditions. Due to the almost identical electron densities of the\ntwo components, when probed by x-rays this alloy exhibits the structure of a homogeneous\nliquid metal. Here we present preliminary results for the eutectic K80 Na20 alloy.\nFig. 1(a) shows the x-ray reflectivity from K80 Na20 along with the predicted reflectivity\nassuming capillary wave roughness (Gaussian form) of 1.2 and 1.5 \u00c511 . At all qz the reflectivity is bounded by these two curves; at lower qz it is better described by the 1.5 \u00c5 roughness.\n>\n\nOn length scales \u223c 6 \u00c5 no obvious structural feature is found beyond the predicted capillary\nwave roughness. The low surface tension (\u2248 120 dyn/cm) and the subsequently high roughness, appears to preclude measurements to qz large enough to directly observe a surface\nlayering peak. This is in contrast to well-defined surface layering peaks observed for Ga, Hg\nor In (see Fig. 1(b))12 .\n\nB.\n\nBi-In\n\nFor systems having significant attractive interactions between unlike atoms, the surface\nstructure is more complex. This is especially true of alloys such as Bi-In which form wellordered intermetallic phases in the bulk solid. In Fig. 2(b) we show the normalized reflectivity for the eutectic composition Bi22 In78 , measured at 80\u25e6 C (\u25b3) along with the normalized\nreflectivity for liquid In at +170\u25e6 C. The alloy exhibits a well defined layering peak centered\nat 2.0 \u00c5\u22121 which resembles the layering peak found for pure In (smudges). In addition, the\nreflectivity displays a modulation with a period of about 0.9 \u00c5\u22121 . This oscillation indicates\nthat ordering over a short region at the surface occurs with a length scale nearly twice that\nof the longer-range layering. This suggests the presence of Bi-In pairs at the surface. A full\nreport on the phase behavior of three different In-Bi alloys will be given elsewhere12 .\n\nC.\n\nGa-Bi\n\nThe Ga-Bi system is an example of an alloy with repulsive heteroatomic interactions\nleading to a bulk miscibility gap. Below the monotectic temperature, Tmono = 222\u25e6 C, a\n\n5\n\n\fFIG. 2: (a) X-ray reflectivity from a K80 N a20 alloy measured by integrating over a large range\nof \u03b1 at fixed \u03b1 + \u03b2. The normalized reflectivity is shown in the inset. The dotted lines show a\ncapillary wave roughness with no layering with \u03c3 = 1.2 and 1.5 \u00c5, respectively. (b) Normalized\nx-ray reflectivity of liquid In (+170\u25e6 C, closed triangles) and In-22at %Bi (80 \u25e6 C, open triangles).\n\n6\n\n\fGa-rich liquid coexists with a solid Bi phase13 . However, due to its lower surface energy a Bi\nmonolayer is expected to segregate at the surface of the Ga-rich liquid. Above Tmono , Ga-Bi\nexhibits a thick wetting film, as predicted for all binary mixtures with critical demixing14 .\nThis transition occurs at a characteristic wetting temperature Tw below the critical temperature Tcrit 13 . Above Tw , a macroscopically thick Bi-rich phase is expected to completely\nwet the less dense Ga-rich phase in defiance of gravity. The Bi concentration in the Ga-rich\nphase increases with increasing temperature as long as the Ga-rich liquid coexists with the\nsolid Bi phase.\nThe normalized x-ray reflectivity spectra, R/RF , for Ga-Bi at 35\u25e6 C and 228\u25e6 C are shown\nin Fig. 3(a) versus qz , along with the profile for pure Ga at room temperature. At 35\u25e6 C the\nnormalized reflectivity has a broad maximum at qz \u2248 1 \u00c5\u22121 . As suggested by Lei et al.7 ,\nthis is consistent with a density profile with a thin, high density monolayer of Bi.\nWe have fit the reflectivity profiles to simple density profiles using Eq. (1). The fitted\nreflectivities are shown in Fig. 3(a) (solid lines). At +35\u25e6 C the local density profile exhibits\na top-layer density which is about 1.5 times higher than the Ga bulk liquid density. The\n3.4 \u00b1 0.2 \u00c5 layer spacing between the surface and the adjacent Ga layer obtained from the\nfits is much larger than the 2.5 \u00b1 0.1 \u00c5 layer spacing obtained in liquid gallium. The data\nshow that the surface layer has a higher density than in the underlying Ga-rich subphase,\nconfirming the surface segregation of a Bi monolayer.\nThe behavior of the same alloy at 228\u25e6 C is markedly different: a sharp peak in R(qz )\nhas emerged, centered around 0.13 \u00c5\u22121 (Fig. 3(a)). The peak at small qz indicates the\npresence of a thick surface layer with a density greater than that of the bulk subphase.\nThe absence of additional oscillations following the sharp peak suggests that the boundary\nbetween the two regions must either be diffuse or rough. The persistence of the broad\nmaximum at qz \u2248 0.75\u00c5\u22121 indicates that Bi monolayer segregation coexists with the newly\nformed wetting film. Fits to a simple two-box model yield a film thickness of 30 \u00c5 consistent\nwith ellipsometry results13 , and a surface density consistent with the high density liquid\nphase of the bulk alloy. The temperature dependent reflectivity will be reported elsewhere12 .\nIn Fig. 3(b) GID data are shown from the same Ga-Bi alloy in the temperature range\nfrom 150 to 255\u25e6 C. Data at 35\u25e6 C was previously reported10 . In the liquid Ga-rich phase\nthe Bi concentration ranges from 3.3 at% to 17.8at%. At each temperature data was taken\nabove and below \u03b1crit = 0.14\u25e6 at \u03b1 = 0.08\u25e6 (symbols) and at \u03b1 = 0.30\u25e6 (lines). At \u03b1 = 0.08\u25e6\n7\n\n\fFIG. 3: (a) Normalized x-ray reflectivity of liquid Ga (+25\u25e6 C, \u25e6), and on the Ga-Bi two-phase\ncoexistence curve at 35\u25e6 C (\u2022) and 228\u25e6 C. (b)Grazing incidence diffraction from Ga-Bi at 150\u25e6 C\n(filled triangles), 205\u25e6 C (\u25b3), 228\u25e6 C, and 255\u25e6 C (\u0003) at \u03b1 = 0.08\u25e6 . The solid line shows corresponding profiles for \u03b1 = 0.30\u25e6 where the bulk is predominately\nsampled. The data was acquired using\n8\nSoller slits, 0.05 \u00c5\u22121 FWHM. Still, it was not possible to reliably subtract the background.\n\n\fthe x-ray penetration depth equals 28\u00c5 or about 10 atomic layers.\nThe solid lines in Fig. 3(b) at 150 \u25e6 C show the bulk liquid scattering which is predominately from pure Ga since the Bi concentration is low. The broad peak at qk = 2.5 \u00c5\u22121 and\nthe shoulder on the high-angle side of the peak are in agreement with the bulk liquid Ga\nstructure factor15 .\nThere is no evidence for a peak or shoulder at the position corresponding to the first peak\nof the Bi liquid structure factor at qk \u2248 2.2 \u00c5\u22121 . This is expected since the surface regime is\nso much smaller than the bulk volume sampled. For \u03b1 = 0.08\u25e6 < \u03b1c , the x-rays penetrate to\na depth of only about 30 \u00c5. Here a shoulder appears on the low-q side of the gallium liquid\npeak, due to enhanced sensitivity to the Bi surface monolayer. Between 150\u25e6C and 205\u25e6 C\n(\u2022) there is little change in the GID data, except a slight increase in the shoulder associated\nwith the Bi monolayer.\nAbove Tmono there is a dramatic change in the GID profiles. In Fig. 3(b), GID data is\nshown at 228\u25e6C and 255\u25e6 C. In both cases, for \u03b1 > \u03b1c the peak has shifted to qk \u2248 2.3 \u00c5\u22121\nfrom the 2.5 \u00c5\u22121 peak position found at lower temperatures. This results from the much\nhigher Bi concentration in the bulk at the higher temperatures and the larger atomic size\nof Bi. Even more dramatic is the shift in the peak position for \u03b1 < \u03b1crit where the peak is\nat 2.15 \u00c5\u22121 . Thus, the surface region contains considerably more Bi than the underlying\nbulk alloy. This finding is consistent with the wetting layer observed in the x-ray reflectivity\nmeasurements.\n\nIII.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work is supported by the U.S. DOE Grant No. DE-FG02-88-ER45379, the National\nScience Foundation Grant No. DMR-94-00396 and the U.S.\u2013Israel Binational Science Foundation, Jerusalem.
