RY Scuti is an extremely rare example of a massive binary\nstar caught in this brief but important phase. Its unusual toroidal nebula indicates\nequatorial mass loss during RLOF, while the mass-gaining star is apparently embedded\nin an opaque accretion disk. RY Scuti's toroidal nebula has two components: an inner\nionised double-ring system, and an outer dust torus that is roughly twice the size of\nthe ionised rings. We present two epochs of L-band Keck natural guide star adaptive\noptics (NGS-AO) images of the dust torus, plus three epochs of Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) images of the ionised gas rings. Proper motions show that the inner ionised\nrings and the outer dust torus, while having similar geometry, came from two separate\nejection events roughly 130 and 250 yr ago. This suggests that WR star formation\nvia RLOF in massive contact binaries can be accompanied by eruptive and episodic\nbursts of mass loss, reminiscent of luminous blue variables (LBVs). We speculate that\nthe repeating outbursts may arise in the mass gainer from instabilities associated with\na high accretion rate. In the case of RY Scuti, we know of no historical evidence that\neither of its mass-loss events were observed as luminous outbursts, but if discrete\nmass-loss episodes in other RLOF binaries are accompanied by luminous outbursts,\nthey might contribute to the population of extragalactic optical transients. When\nRLOF ends for RY Scuti, the overluminous mass gainer, currently surrounded by an\naccretion disk, will probably become a B[e] supergiant and may outshine the hotter\nstripped-envelope mass-donor star that should die as a Type Ib/c supernova.\nKey words: binaries: eclipsing - binaries: general - circumstellar matter \u2013 stars:\nevolution - stars: mass loss - supernovae: general\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRY Scuti is a remarkable blue supergiant eclipsing binary\nsystem at a distance of 1.8 kpc (Smith et al. 2002). It has\na well-determined period of only 11.1247 days (Smith et al.\n\n\u22c6 Based in part on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for\nResearch in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.\n\u2020 Email: nathans@as.arizona.edu\n\u2021 gehrz@astro.umn.edu\n\n2002), and the shape of the eclipse light curve suggests that\nit is in an advanced stage of Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF)\n(Antokhina & Cherepashchuk 1988; Guircin & Mardirossian\n1981; Antokhina & Kumsiashvili 1999; Djurasevic et al.\n2001; Melikian et al. 2010). RY Scuti belongs to the class of\nW Serpentis massive binaries, where significant mass transfer has led to an opaque disk around the mass-gaining star\n(Plavec 1980), and it has the shortest known period among\nexamples of the class.\nMost recent studies of the system's radial velocity variations converge on a binary system with an \u223c8 M\u2299 primary\nand a \u223c30 M\u2299 secondary (Antokhina & Cherepashchuk\n\n\f2\n\nSmith et al.\n\n1988; Skul'skii 1992; Sahade et al. 1992; Antokhina & Kumsiashvili 1999; Grundstrom et al. 2007). The 8 M\u2299 primary\nis an O9/B0 supergiant, and is thought to have initially been\nthe more massive of the two, but has transferred much of\nits mass to the secondary. (The likely initial masses of the\nprimary and secondary were then of order 20-25 and 1520 M\u2299 , respectively.) It has been suggested that the massgaining secondary, probably an O5 star, is enshrouded by an\nopaque accretion disc (King & Jameson 1979; Antokhina &\nCherepashchuk 1988; Antokhina & Kumsiashvili 1999). For\nrecent discussions of the detailed properties of the circumstellar nebula and the binary system, we refer the reader to\nSmith et al. (2002) and Grundstrom et al. (2007), respectively. These authors review the literature concerning spatially resolved structure in the nebula (Hjellming et al. 1973;\nGehrz et al. 1995, 2001; Smith et al. 1999, 2001, 2002), the\nunusual high-excitation spectrum with multiple-peak line\nprofiles (Merrill 1928; Swings & Struve 1940; de Martino\net al. 1992; Skul'skii & West 1993; Smith et al. 2002), and\nthe photometric and spectroscopic variability of the eclipsing\nbinary (Cowley & Hutchings 1976; King & Jameson 1979;\nAntokhina & Cherepashchuk 1988; Skul'skii 1992; Kumsiashvili et al. 2007; Djurasevik et al. 2001, 2008; Grundstrom\net al. 2007).\nDetailed study of RY Scuti and its nebula are of broader\ninterest to the evolution of massive stars in two chief respects, as follows.\n(1) Based on the He-rich abundances of its nebula, the\nmasses of the stellar components, the orbital configuration,\nand the evolutionary state, it has been proposed that the\nO9/BO supergiant primary will soon evolve to a Wolf-Rayet\n(WR) star as a result of binary mass transfer, and that\nRY Scuti therefore represents an immediate precursor to a\nmassive WR+OB binary system (Guircin & Mardirossian\n1981; Antokhina & Cherepashchuk 1988; Smith et al. 2002).\nAs such, it provides a rare glimpse at the formation of WRlike stars in binary systems, and hence, one of the two chief\nchannels for producing progenitors of Type Ib/c supernovae\n(SNe). SNe Ibc are core-collapse SNe arising from massive\n\"stripped-envelope\" progenitors that have shed their outer\nH layers, and in some cases their He layers as well; see Filippenko (1997) for a review. The first evolutionary channel for making WR stars is where massive stars with initial\nmasses above 30\u201335 M\u2299 shed their H envelopes by virtue\nof their own mass loss in stellar winds or eruptions (Conti\n1976; Smith & Owocki 2006). A second evolutionary channel, which is the only one available to less massive stars\nwhose winds are too weak to reach the WR phase on their\nown, is to have their H envelope (and possibly also the He\nenvelope) stripped via RLOF in a close binary system (e.g.,\nPaczy\u0144ski 1967; Podsiadlowski et al. 1992; Petrovic et al.\n2005). Recent evidence from the observed statistics of SNe\nargues that RLOF may be the dominant channel for producing progenitors of SNe Ibc (Smith et al. 2011; see also Yoon\net al. 2010; Dessart et al. 2011). The mass-transfer phase in\nmassive binaries is thought to be brief, lasting only \u223c104 yr\n(Petrovic et al. 2005). RY Scuti is an extremely rare example\nof a massive binary star caught in this critical phase, and\nit may be the only known example with a bright spatially\n\nresolved circumstellar nebula.1 Its properties are therefore\nvaluable for checking the conclusions drawn from studies of\nWR+OB systems already in the post-mass-transfer phase.\n(2) RY Scuti may provide important clues to formation\nof toroidal and bipolar nebulae. Close binaries and mergers\nare often invoked to explain the formation of bipolar nebulae and rings like those around SN 1987A and other massive\nstars (Morris & Podsiadlowski 2006; Collins et al. 1999),\nalthough asymmetric mass loss from rapidly rotating stars\nhas also been proposed for such nebulae and disks (Owocki\n2003; Owocki et al. 1996; Dwarkadas & Owocki 2002; Smith\n2007; Smith & Townsend 2007; Chi\u0163\u01ce et al. 2008). One of the\nambiguities for many nebulae is the lack of independent evidence that the central stars are (or were) binaries, and the\nrole that binarity might have played in shaping the nebulae\nis therefore unknown. RY Scuti has the distinct advantage\nthat it is an eclipsing system, so that its binary stellar parameters are known quite well. It is in a state of overcontact\nwhere RLOF is occurring and significant mass loss and mass\ntransfer has taken place. Its nebula is toroidal, not bipolar,\nand so the observed morphology of RY Scuti's mass loss\nmay provide important constraints on models for shaping\nnebulae with close binary influence.\nThe structure and dynamics of RY Scuti's nebula can\naid our understanding of the role binarity plays in producing SNe Ibc progenitors and in determining nebular morphology. The structure, morphology, and kinematics of the\nnebula provide clues to its formation, while the age of its\ncomponents give a record of the system's recent mass-loss\nhistory.\nPrevious observations by Gehrz et al. (1995, 2001) and\nSmith et al. (1999, 2001, 2002) have established that RY\nScuti is 1.8 \u00b1 0.1 kpc distant and that its toroidal nebula is\nseparated into two components: an outer dust torus with a\ndiameter of \u223c2\u2032\u2032 or 3600 AU, and an inner ionised torus with\na diameter of \u223c1\u2032\u2032 (1800 AU). The mass of the dust torus is\n\u223c10\u22126 M\u2299 (dust only), and the ionised inner component has\na gas mass of at least 0.003 M\u2299 . The ionised component has\nan unusually high-excitation spectrum (Merrill 1928; Swings\n& Struve 1940; de Martino et al. 1992; Smith et al. 2002),\nand displays evidence for significant He and N enrichment\n(Smith et al. 2002). In high-resolution images taken with\nthe Hubble Space Telescope (HST) by Smith et al. (1999,\n2001), the inner ionised torus appears to break up into a\npair of plane-parallel rings, analogous to the polar rings of\nSN 1987A, but confined much more closely to the equatorial plane (i.e., at latitudes of \u00b114\u25e6 from the equator, rather\nthan \u223c45\u25e6 as in SN 1987A). The ionised rings are expanding\nwith Doppler shifts of roughly \u00b142 km s\u22121 , and an initial\n(although imprecise) measurement of their proper-motion\nexpansion has been made in two epochs of HST images separated by \u223c2 yr, combined with two epochs of radio continuum images obtained with the Very Large Array that were\nseparated by 9 yr. These data implied an ejection episode\nsometime in the late 19th century (Smith et al. 2001). The\n\n1\n\nAnother interesting example may be the radio-bright source W9\nin the Galactic Centre region (Dougherty et al. 2010), but that\nsource is much farther away, its nebula has not been spatially\nresolved, and it is not an eclipsing system.\n\n\fMultiple Ejections from RY Scuti\nTable 1.

We summarise our conclusions in \u00a76.\n\n2\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nWe obtained multi-epoch high-resolution observations of RY\nScuti, using HST images to trace the inner ionised rings and\nKeck Observatory L-band images to trace the outer dust\ntorus in the IR. The log of observations is listed in Table 1.\n\n2.1\n\nMulti-Epoch HST Imaging\n\nThree epochs of images of RY Scuti were obtained with the\nHST Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) using the\nF656N (H\u03b1) filter, plus single epochs with the F658N ([N ii]\n\u03bb6583; see below) and F953N ([S iii] \u03bb9532) filters. The first\ntwo epochs of H\u03b1 images were published and analyzed previously (Smith et al. 1999, 2001). For the third epoch of H\u03b1\nobservations, we implemented the same observing strategy\nand followed the same data-reduction steps as for the first\ntwo. This involved combining a series of exposures with a\nrange of exposure times to correct for CCD blooming from\nthe bright central star, as well as a careful subtraction of a\nmodel point-spread function (PSF) generated by the TinyTim software, as described in the earlier papers. The PSF\nsubtraction is necessary because the extended diffraction\npattern in the PSF from the bright central star can interfere\nwith and mask the nebular structures. After PSF subtraction, the newest epoch of images confirms the same structures seen in our earlier studies, but taken with a different\nroll angle and orientation of the PSF diffraction spikes.\nOur goals in obtaining a third epoch were to confirm\nour previous detection of expansion of the rings made with\na short temporal baseline (Smith et al. 2001) and to thereby\n\n3\n\nimprove the precision of the ejection age for comparison\nwith that of the outer torus. For the proper-motion measurements, we use the F656N (H\u03b1) filter as it is the only\none available in all three epochs. The F658N image is useful to investigate any possible spatial gradients in ionization\nstructure in the rings. The elapsed time between the second\nepoch and the first is 994.43 days, or \u2206t = 2.723 yr. The\nlast epoch extends this temporal baseline to 4340.13 days,\nor \u2206t = 11.883 yr since epoch 1.\n\n2.2\n\nKeck NIRC2-AO Imaging\n\nUsing the Keck II AO system (Wizinowich 1999) with the instrument NIRC2, we obtained two epochs of L-prime (hereafter Lp ) images. They were acquired with the narrow camera (10 mas pixel\u22121 scale) making use of a five-point box\ndither pattern with a 1.\u2032\u2032 0 step size. Due to the peak brightness of the RY Scuti central point source, a square subarray\nof 512 pixels (out of 1024) was employed so that the minimum exposure time could be set to 50 ms, thus avoiding\nsaturation. The dominant source of background at 3.8 \u03bcm\nis the thermal radiation of the AO system telescope optics.\nDust on the 11 ambient-temperature optical surfaces that\nare in the path of NIRC2 are a significant source of background. Frequent dithers were used to reduce time varying\neffects of the background. RY Scuti (V = 9.14 mag) provides\nplenty of visible-light flux to the AO wavefront sensor, allowing the frame rate to be set to a relatively high frequency; it\nwas 700 Hz in 2003 and 1500 Hz in 2009. Higher frequencies\nbecame possible thanks to an upgrade of the wavefront controller (van Dam 2007). The AO performance was superb,\nin both cases resulting in diffraction-limited resolution of\nabout 72 mas with a Strehl greater than 70%. The PSF is\nwell sampled in the NIRC2 narrow-camera plate scale.\nThe data reduction was performed in the customary\nmethod for IR imaging data. Before shifting and coadding\nthe 3-point dithered data, we flat-fielded the images using\nnormalised flats constructed from sky-only data acquired 1\u2032\nnorth of the nebula. The flattened images were then background subtracted using the sky images. The images were\naligned using the centroid of RY Scuti's central point source.\nThe initial goal was to produce the best image yet of the IR\ndust torus with diffraction-limited imaging in the near-IR\nto complement the previous Keck mid-IR images obtained\nwith the long-wavelength spectrometer (Gehrz et al. 2001).\nThe subsequent goal of the later-epoch observation was to\nmeasure the expansion of the outer dust torus separately\nfrom the inner ionised gas nebula.\n\n3\n\nMULTI-WAVELENGTH STRUCTURE\n\nWe investigated the multi-wavelength structure of the nebula by comparing the IR and optical images. The morphology of the optical images in H\u03b1 was already discussed in\ndetail in previous papers (Smith et al. 2002, 2001, 1999).\nThe NIRC2-AO images in the L band provide the highestresolution images of the dust torus so far. They are comparable in spatial resolution to the HST images, permitting\nthe first meaningful comparison between the two. Figure 1\nshows a colour composite comparing the HST image to the\n\n\f4\n\nSmith et al.\n\nRY Scuti\n\n1\"\n\nHST/WFPC2 H\u03b1\nKeck/NIRC2-AO Lp\nFigure 1. A colour composite of the ionised gas traced by the HST/WFPC2 image taken through the F656N H\u03b1 filter (blue-green) and\nthe warm dust traced by the Keck/NIRC2-AO image in the Lp filter (red-orange).\n\nnear-IR Keck-AO Lp image, while Figure 2 provides various comparisons of multi-wavelength data from the present\nstudy and from a previous study of thermal-IR Keck images\nby Gehrz et al. (2001).\nThe first-epoch 2003 image of RY Scuti obtained with\nNIRC2-AO is shown in Figure 2a. The combination of AO\nand the better diffraction limit at \u223c4 \u03bcm as compared\nto \u223c10 \u03bcm means that this Lp -band image provides the\nsharpest view yet of the structure in the dust torus around\nRY Scuti, improving the spatial resolution from our previous thermal-IR Keck images without AO (Gehrz et al. 2001)\nby a factor of 2\u20133. The warm-dust emission in this filter\ntraces the same dust responsible for the torus observed at\nlonger wavelengths. This is evident from Figure 2b, which\nshows the same NIRC2-AO image from Figure 2a with the\ncontours of 11.7 \u03bcm emission from Gehrz et al. (2001) superposed. Allowing for differences in spatial resolution (and\nfor stronger photospheric emission from the central star at\nshorter wavelengths), the Lp -band image has the same spatial distribution as the 11.7 \u03bcm thermal-IR emission. This\nwas expected, since the 2\u201320 \u03bcm spectral energy distribution (SED) of the dust torus can be fitted with a single dust\ntemperature (Gehrz et al. 2001). In other words, the Lp fil-\n\nter at 3.8 \u03bcm samples the Wien tail of the same 300\u2013400 K\ndust whose emission peaks at \u223c10 \u03bcm, rather than sampling\nhotter dust closer to the star. The new AO image indicates a\nvery thin distribution of dust in the radial direction, consistent with our findings below that the dust torus originated\nin an episodic ejection from the star.\nThe NIRC2-AO images show unprecedented detail of\nthe structure in the IR torus. The toroidal nebula obviously\nappears pinched at the waist, flaring above and below the\nequator. This appearance could be due to the overlap of two\ninclined rings, as in the optical images, or it could be that the\ndust torus is akin to an hourglass structure with the top and\nbottom chopped off. In either case, the dust torus appears\nto have a sharp outer boundary, and we see no evidence\nin either the HST or near-IR images for faint extensions of\na larger hourglass structure. Overall, the structure of the\nIR dust torus resembles the morphology seen in the inner\nionised rings, but with roughly twice the size.\nThe near-IR AO images reveal no clear evidence for an\nenhancement of dust emission from parts of the nebula inside\nthe dust torus, consistent with the single-temperature dust\nSED as noted above. In particular, there is no enhancement\nof IR emission coincident with the ionised structures of the\n\n\fMultiple Ejections from RY Scuti\n\n5\n\nFigure 2. (a) The first-epoch 2003 June 11 Lp -band NIRC2-AO image of RY Scuti (the second epoch looks identical, except for a\ndifferent orientation of the diffraction pattern). (b) Same image as in (a), but overlaid with contours of the 11.7 \u03bcm image from Gehrz\net al. (2001). (c) The PSF-subtracted HST/WFPC2 H\u03b1 (F656N) image of RY Scuti. (d) The Lp -band image from (a) overlaid with\ncontours of the HST image.\n\ninner rings seen in H\u03b1 images with HST (except for some\nspurious features associated with the Keck PSF). Since the\ninner rings are closer to the star and any dust therein would\nbe hotter and more easily detected at short IR wavelengths,\nwe conclude that the inner rings have a much lower dust\nmass than the outer rings. The second mass-ejection event\nthat produced the inner rings evidently did not form dust\nas efficiently \u2013 at least not yet. Given that the temperature\nof the outer dust torus is 300\u2013400 K (Gehrz et al. 2001), the\nequilibrium grain temperature in the inner rings (at roughly\nhalf the distance from the same star) should be about 420\u2013\n560 K. Since the condensation temperature of dust grains\nis typically >\n\u223c 1000 K, any dust that was destined to form\nin the inner rings should have done so already. An inter-\n\nesting possibility is that the second ejection, which formed\nthe inner ionised nebula, was able to shield the outer torus\nfrom ionising radiation, thereby allowing it to form dust.\nOne could speculate, then, that a hypothetical future ejection might be needed to shield the inner torus seen now\nin HST images in order to facilitate dust formation in that\nfeature.\nThe higher resolution of the new near-IR AO images\nreveals for the first time a clear gap between the inner\nionised rings and the outer dust torus. Figure 3 shows tracings across the middle of the Keck IR and HST images (see\nbelow), both as observed in 2009. For comparison, Figure 3\nalso shows very simple, idealised models for the optically\nthin intensity from a cross section through the middle of the\n\n\f6\n\nSmith et al.\n\nFigure 3. Spatial intensity scans across the major axis in the 2009 PSF-subtracted HST H\u03b1 image (thick line) and the 2009 Keck\nIR image (thin line), along a position angle of 60\u25e6 . For comparison, the shaded regions show simple models for the intensity of a slice\nthrough an idealised optically thin edge-on torus, with inner and outer radii noted above each peak. We used different parameters for\nthe NE and SW sides due to the inherent asymmetry of the nebula. The darker and lighter shaded regions respectively approximate the\nintensity cut across the IR torus and the inner ionised rings seen by HST. This lighter shaded region includes a broader base that is an\narbitrarily scaled version of the IR torus (to mimic the scattered H\u03b1 light from the outer nebula; see Smith et al. 2002).\n\ngeometrically thin shell (see Smith et al. 2007 for more details). These simple models are not perfect matches to the\ndata due to the non-azimuthally symmetric density structure of the ionised rings (Smith et al. 2002). While the NE\nside of the nebula matches the simple models rather well,\nthe SW portion deviates - and interestingly, both the inner ionised rings and the outer dust torus deviate from the\nmodel on the SW side in the same manner. This requires\nthat both the inner and outer tori deviate from azimuthal\nsymmetry in a similar way. This is probably an important\nclue to the ejection mechanism that formed them.\nThe simple models in Figure 3 allow us to provide rough\nestimates of the inner and outer radii for both the ionised\nand dusty tori. These values are listed in Figure 3, and we\nnote that the values derived from images of the inner ionised\ncomponent agree with the thickness inferred from STIS spectroscopy (Smith et al. 2002). The radial thicknesses of the\nmodel shells are 23\u201328% of their radii. More importantly,\nthere is a clear gap between the inner edge of the IR torus\nand the outer edge of the ionised rings (i.e., the structures\ndo not touch or overlap). This is most evident on the NE\nside of the nebula (Figure 3), and is clear in the colour image in Figure 1 as well, indicating a spatial separation of the\ndust and ionised gas. Physically, this is quite meaningful; it\n\nindicates that the outer boundary of the ionised rings is not\ncaused by a simple ionization front, because in that case\nwe would expect non-ionising UV photons to penetrate the\nionization front and heat the dust immediately outside it.\nThe large separation instead suggests that the IR peak is a\nseparate density enhancement at a larger radius where the\nremaining UV radiation is absorbed. (The inner ring may\nnevertheless play an important role in shielding the outer\ndust torus, but our point here is that the outer boundary\nof the ionised torus is caused by a drop in density, not an\nionization front.) As we show below, proper motions indicate that the outer IR dust torus is older and originated in\na separate mass-ejection event. The spatial gap between the\ninner and outer rings indicates that the outer ring was not\nresponsible for shaping the inner ring, because they are not\ninteracting hydrodynamically.\n\nIn the ionised inner torus, the NE peak is much brighter\nthan the SW peak. For the IR torus, the reverse is true. Perhaps this is because the NE side of the IR torus is shielded\nby a denser inner nebula, as compared to the SW side. Of\ncourse, these differences may be due purely to different density distributions as well.\n\n\fMultiple Ejections from RY Scuti\n\n7\n\nFigure 4. Spatial intensity scans across the major axis in PSF-subtracted HST images. The top panel shows tracings for H\u03b1 F656N\n(solid black) and [N ii] F658N (solid grey) in the newest epoch from 2009. The middle panel gives the tracings through H\u03b1 images at\nall three epochs in 1997 (solid), 2000 (dotted), and 2009 (solid histogram). The bottom panel is the same as the middle, except that the\nsizes of the 2000 and 2009 intensity scans have been multiplied by 97.7% and 90.7% of their observed size, respectively, to match the size\nin the 1997 image.\n\n4\n\n4.1\n\nPROPER MOTIONS OF THE TWO\nCOMPONENTS\nThe Inner Ionised Rings with HST\n\nBy aligning the three epochs of HST images, we were able to\nconfirm that the expansion of the rings is primarily homologous (i.e., self-similar radial expansion). When an image\ntaken at an early epoch is magnified by some scaling factor,\nit looks identical to one taken at a later epoch. We detect no\nevidence for non-radial motion, acceleration, or deceleration\nin the expanding nebula.\nTo quantify the fractional increase in size between\nepochs, we scaled later images so that the nebular structure matched that in the first epoch, and then performed\na cross correlation of the scaled image to estimate the best\n\nscaling factor. This is similar to the method employed by\nMorse et al. (2001) for measuring proper motions in HST\nimages of \u03b7 Carinae, except that here we adopted a multiplicative size-scaling factor for the whole nebula (with central regions near the star masked out) rather than measuring\ntranslational shifts independently for many individual small\ncondensations. The former method is well suited to the compact size and simpler structure of RY Scuti's nebula.\nTo illustrate the scaling between epochs, Figure 4 (middle panel) shows intensity tracings across the major axis of\nthe nebula through the emission peaks on either side of the\nstar at each epoch. One can see that the nebula is clearly\nexpanding with time. The bottom panel in Figure 4 shows\nthe same tracings, but with the pixel size scale of the 2009\nand 2001 images reduced to match the structure in the 1997\n\n\f8\n\nSmith et al.\n\nFigure 5. Proper motions of the IR torus in Keck/NIRC2-AO images. The top panel shows the 2003 June 11 image of RY Scuti in the\nLp band obtained with Keck/NIRC2-AO, rotated counterclockwise by 30\u25e6 (note that many features within 0.\u2032\u2032 5 of the star are part of\nthe PSF diffraction pattern of the Keck telescope). The horizontal lines marked \"star\" and \"NW\" give the positions of intensity tracings\nacross the image, shown in the middle and bottom panels. The middle panel displays the intensity scans for these two positions (with a\nconstant offset added to the \"NW\" tracing) as observed in 2003 June (dashed) and 2009 August (solid). The bottom panel is the same\nas the middle, except that the size of the 2009 intensity scan has been multiplied by 97.6%, giving the best match to the 2003 image\n(both \"star\" and \"NW\" tracings were scaled by the same factor). The light-grey curve shows the same tracing of H\u03b1 from the HST data\nin Figure 4.\n\nimage. Similar tracings for the Keck images are shown in\nFigure 5.\nWe define the scale factor \u01eb by which the size of the\nnebula at epoch 2 (R2 ) must be reduced to match the radius\nat epoch 1 (R1 ) as \u01eb = R1 /R2 . In terms of this scaling factor\n\u01eb, the age of the nebula t (the time since ejection relative to\nepoch 2) is given by\nt = \u2206t \u00d7 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)\u22121 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u2206t is the time period that has elapsed between the\nimages at epochs 1 and 2. We define epochs 1, 2, and 3 as the\nimages taken in 1997, 2000, and 2009, respectively. From the\ndates of observations, \u2206t1,2 = 2.7226 yr and \u2206t1,3 = 11.8826\n\nyr. By cross correlating the NE and SW peak structures\nat different epochs, we measure \u01eb1,2 = 0.977 \u00b1 0.003 and\n\u01eb1,3 = 0.907 \u00b1 0.003. Equation (1) then yields ages of t1,2 =\n118.4 \u00b1 16 yr (relative to 2000) and t1,3 = 127.8 \u00b1 4.2 yr\n(relative to 2009). The uncertainties are Gaussian 3\u03c3 error\nbars resulting from the spatial cross-correlation of each pair\nof epochs. Thus, the baselines between epochs 1 and 2 (1997\u2013\n2000) and between epochs 1 and 3 (1997\u20132009) both agree\non an ejection date around the year 1881 for the ionised\ntorus. We adopt an uncertainty of \u00b14.2 yr in the age and\nejection date, since it corresponds to the longer temporal\nbaseline with a more precise measurement. Note that this\nmeasurement is independent of the precision to which we\n\n\fMultiple Ejections from RY Scuti\n\nFigure 6. Plot of the increase in the width of the major axis of\nRY Scuti's nebula with time; the width is measured consistently\nat half the peak intensity level. Unfilled points correspond to the\nIR torus measured in Keck Lp images obtained in 2003 and 2009,\nwhile the filled points correspond to the ionised rings measured\nin archival VLA data from 1983 and 1992 (from Smith et al.\n2001) and HST/H\u03b1 images obtained in 1997, 2000, and 2009. The\ndotted line extrapolates the expansion rate measured from the\ntwo Keck points. The dashed and solid lines show least-squares\nfits for the expansion of the ionised rings with the first two VLA\ndata points included and excluded, respectively, along with the\nsubsequent three HST images.\n\nThe middle panel displays the tracings for the two epochs\nat the two sampled positions, while the bottom panel illustrates the same tracings except that the 2009 epoch has been\nscaled to match the 2003 image (see discussion above concerning the HST images and Fig. 4). The two different position samples are consistent with the same expansion rate.\nThe comparison of the 2003 and 2009 Keck images\nof the IR dust torus shows that the size of the torus in\n2003 was 97.6% (\u00b10.3%) of the size observed in 2009 (i.e.,\n\u01eb1,2 = 0.976 \u00b1 0.003). Since the time elapsed between images was \u2206t = 6.216 yr, Equation (1) indicates that the\ndynamical age of the dust torus is 255 \u00b1 32 yr, implying an\nejection date around the year 1754. This is more than twice\nthe age of the inner ionised rings determined above from\nHST images, so the two components cannot be the result of\nthe same mass ejection. The age derived from this method is\nconsistent within the uncertainty with the age derived from\nthe simpler method described above and shown in Figure 6,\nwhere we measured the changing width of the major axis\nof the nebula at half the peak intensity, following Smith et\nal. (2001). This simpler method is more susceptible to error\ncaused by changes in spatial resolution, which is more of a\nconcern in ground-based data than in HST data having a\nmore consistent PSF. We therefore favour the ejection date\naround 1754.\n\n5\n5.1\n\ncan spatially align the central star in the images, since we\nare simply measuring the growth in size across the nebula,\nnot the distance from the star.\nFigure 6 shows the expansion of RY Scuti's nebula in a\ndifferent way. This is an updated version of Figure 3 from\nSmith et al. (2001), including the new Keck data and the\nlast epoch of HST imaging. It shows measurements of the\nwidth of the major axis of the nebula measured at half the\npeak intensity. For the ionised rings, this includes the images of radio free-free emission obtained with the VLA in\n1983 and 1992, as well as the three epochs of H\u03b1 imaging\nin 1997, 2000, and 2009. The dashed and solid lines show\na linear least-squares fit (weight \u221d \u03c3 \u22121/2 ) to the expansion\nrate of the ring with (dashed) and without (solid) the early\nVLA data included in the fit. These fits yield ejection dates\nof 1878\u00b15 and 1883\u00b16, respectively, for the ionised component of the nebula, consistent with the ejection date of\n1881\u00b14 derived from the first method discussed above. The\ndotted line extrapolates the expansion rate measured the\nsame way in the IR Keck images; this is not a fit since there\nare only two points. The implied ejection date of 1794\u00b130\nyr for the dust torus is younger than that derived below, but\nis consistent within the uncertainty.\n4.2\n\nThe Outer Dust Torus with Keck AO\n\nWe employed the same method of measuring the expansion\nof the dust torus in IR images as described above for the\nHST images, except that for the IR images we had only two\nepochs. Figure 5 shows intensity tracings across the long axis\nof the dust torus at two positions, indicated in the top panel.\n\n9\n\nDISCUSSION\nFormation of the Double Rings\n\nThe mechanism for the formation of the rings around\nSN 1987A has presented an enduring mystery that has no\nobvious answer (e.g., Blondin & Lundqvist 1993; Burrows et\nal. 1995; Martin & Arnett 1995; Collins et al. 1999; Morris\n& Podsiadlowski 2005), but one expects that the formation\nmechanism of the rings might also be an important clue to\nunderstanding the peculiar nature of the blue progenitor star\nSk \u221269 202. Smith et al. (2007) noted a population of stars\nwith equatorial rings that are analogous to the equatorial\nring around SN 1987A, including RY Scuti. Only one other\nobject, the luminous blue variable (LBV) star HD 168625,\nis known to have triple rings similar to those of SN 1987A\n(Smith 2007). RY Scuti has a set of double ionised rings\nwhich are not identical to those of SN 1987A, but may be\nrelated.\nOne can test some models for formation of double rings\nby measuring the expansion dynamics of the rings \u2013 i.e.,\ndo they exhibit homologous expansion, non-radial expansions, or other peculiar motions or time-variable illumination? Models with aspherical ejection from the star system would predict homologous expansion at these large distances. On the other hand, models such as those of Chi\u0163\u01ce et\nal. (2008) have the rings produced by a bipolar wind pushing through a previously ejected thin shell, with the two\nstructures colliding and forming rings at their intersection.\nIn this model, the apparent ring structure originates where\nthe rings are observed, rather than the shaping mechanism\narising close to the star. It would predict motion of the rings\ntoward the equatorial plane with time as the inner bipolar\nwind sweeps through the thin spherical shell, with the intersection migrating from the pole to the equator (see Chi\u0163\u01ce\n\n\f10\n\nSmith et al.\n\net al. 2008). We therefore conclude that models such as the\none discussed by Chi\u0163\u01ce et al. (2008) do not apply in the case\nof RY Scuti, since the nebula is expanding homologously.\nA broad class of hydrodynamic models involves the formation of bipolar nebulae by the interaction of a wind with\na previously ejected equatorial density enhancement; essentially, a pre-existing disk or torus pinches the waist of subsequently ejected material to produce an hourglass shape.\nA model by Morris & Podsiadlowski (2007) accounts for the\nformation of SN 1987A's nebula with a merger of a binary\nsystem, where the merger ejects an equatorial torus or disk\nof material that might then divert a faster wind toward high\nlatitudes, forming a pair of polar caps that could be seen\nas rings under proper circumstances of illumination. That\nmerger model cannot apply here, since RY Scuti has not yet\nmerged. More importantly, the gap between the two components indicates that the second mass ejection is not yet\ninteracting hydrodynamically with the first one, even at this\nvery young stage, so the formation of its rings must have a\ndifferent origin that doesn't depend on hydrodynamic shaping by a previously ejected disk.\nInstead, the proper motions in RY Scuti's nebula suggest that on at least two separate occasions separated by\nonly \u223c 100\u2013200 yr, the star system suffered some sort of\noutburst that ejected mass near the equator at relatively\nslow speeds (i.e., much slower than the escape speed or normal wind speed of either star). It also suggests that whatever mechanism shaped the first ejection was able to persist\nand have the same influence on the second, because both\nejections have the same basic geometry and structure. The\ncause of such an outburst is unknown, but some ideas are\ndiscussed in \u00a75.3. Here we focus on the shape of the ejecta,\nand we discuss two potential scenarios, the second of which\nwe deem to be more likely.\n(1) During an episode of increased mass loss or mass\ntransfer from the primary star, RY Scuti may have suffered an enhancement of mass loss through the outer L2\nLagrangian point (see Figure 7). From the phase variability of absorption features such as He i lines, Grundstrom et\nal. (2007) inferred that RY Scuti does in fact have a massloss stream exiting the system through the L2 point in its\npresent-day state. An increase in this mass-loss rate at two\nseparate times in the past could lead to the creation of discrete toroidal structures that would expand outward to form\nthe currently observed circumstellar nebula. One potential\ninconsistency is that the observed outflow through L2 has an\nexpansion speed of \u223c 200 km s\u22121 (Grundstrom et al. 2007),\nwhereas the toroidal circumstellar nebula has a much slower\nradial expansion of only \u223c 40 km s\u22121 (Smith et al. 2002).\nAnother problem with this scenario is that even with\nan enhancement of mass transfer and mass loss through L2,\none would normally expect mass loss through the outer Lagrangian point to be a relatively slow process compared to\nthe orbital period of only \u223c11 days, leading to azimuthally\nsymmetric mass loss. Thus, while this scenario accounts for\nequatorially enhanced mass loss, it provides no compelling\nexplanation for the nature of sudden outbursts or for the\nazimuthal asymmetry observed in RY Scuti's ionised rings.\nFurthermore, the origin of the double ionised ring structure\nis unclear in this scenario, unless the apparent separation\nbetween the rings is due to a shadow cast by an opaque cir-\n\ncumbinary disk at inner radii much smaller than the size of\nthe rings, as suggested by Grundstrom et al. (2007).\n(2) A different scenario may be that the accreting secondary star experiences an outburst, and that the outflowing\nejecta are immediately shaped by the accretion torus within\na few stellar radii around the secondary (Figure 7). As we\nexplain further in \u00a75.3, invoking an outburst from the secondary is motivated by our speculation that the secondary\nmay encounter a cyclical instability associated with the high\nmass accretion and angular momentum accretion rates currently imposed on it during RLOF.\nSuppose that the envelope of the accreting secondary\nstar becomes unstable and suffers a sudden outburst of mass\nloss. The ejecta that follow mid- to high-latitude trajectories\ntoward the pole will expand unimpeded (represented by the\ndashed arrows in Figure 7), probably at very high speeds of\n\u223c 1000 km s\u22121 , close to the escape speed of a main-sequence\nO-type star (recall that the secondary star in the RY Scuti\nsystem is thought to be a main-sequence O-type star that\nis hidden by its cooler, opaque accretion torus; Grundstrom\net al. 2007). On the other hand, the ejecta expanding at\nlow latitudes near the equator must contend with the presence of the massive, dense accretion torus. The stellar ejecta\nwill be decelerated by this interaction, and perhaps some of\nthe material on the surface of the accretion torus will be\nentrained by the outflow that is diverted above and below\nthe torus. This will result in a much slower outflow from\nthe system at latitudes immediately above and below the\nedges of the accretion torus (this is depicted by the solid\nshort arrows in Figure 7). If the ejection is a sudden event,\nit will produce an enhancement of mass at specific latitudes\nabove and below the equatorial plane, at a specific distance\nfrom the star (i.e., plane-parallel rings rather than a shell or\nconical structures).2 In this scenario, it is the thickness of\nthe accretion torus that sets the latitude and separation of\nthe rings that we observe in the circumstellar nebula. The\npresence of a thick accretion torus reaching at least \u00b115\u25e6 is\nrequired by the fact that the accretion torus obscures the\nsecondary in a system with an orbital inclination of i \u2248 75\u25e6\n(Smith et al. 2002). This roughly matches the latitudes of\nthe nebular rings at \u00b114\u25e6 .\nIf a sudden (i.e., dynamical) outburst of the secondary\nstar occurs on a time scale short compared to the orbital\nperiod, then it may provide a compelling explanation for\nthe azimuthal asymmetry in the system as well: the parts\nof the outflowing ejecta that expand toward the bloated supergiant primary star must interact with that star and its\nwind. This would lead to a gap in the ejecta over a range\nof azimuthal angles covering 15\u201330% of the orbit. This is\ncommensurate with the size of the gap on the near side of\nthe nebula (Smith et al. 2002). Without a sudden outburst,\none would expect the outflow to be azimuthally symmetric,\ncontradicting observations.\nBecause a sudden ejection by the secondary star can, in\nprinciple, account for both the latitudinal and azimuthal distribution of mass in the nebula around RY Scuti, we find this\nscenario to be more compelling than option (1) discussed\n\n2 Note that if the mass ejection is related to critical rotation, as\nwe speculate in \u00a75.3, then it is possible that the mass ejection\nitself will be inherently non-spherical.\n\n\fMultiple Ejections from RY Scuti\n\n11\n\nRY Scuti\n\u03c6 = 0.25\n\nL1\nL2\n\nPrimary\nO9.7 Ibpe\n8 Msun\nRLOF\n\nSecondary\nB0.5 I\n30 Msun\nopaque accretion torus\n\n0.66 AU\n\nFigure 7.

The primary is filling its Roche lobe and transferring matter to the secondary, which is surrounded by an\nopaque accretion disk/torus. The long dashed arrows represent the trajectory of unimpeded wind or eruptive ejecta from the secondary.\nThe shorter solid black arrows represent the trajectory of denser and slower disk material entrained by the secondary wind, or wind/ejecta\nthat are decelerated through interaction with the torus. In a scenario where the accreting secondary suffers an outburst, this slower and\ndenser material skimming the edge of the torus may form the rings around RY Scuti. With M1 + M2 = 38M\u2299 (Grundstrom et al. 2007)\nand P = 11.12475 d (Smith et al. 2002), the orbital semimajor axis is a = 0.33 AU.\n\nabove. Of course, our suggestion should be explored using\ndetailed numerical hydrodynamic simulations. Some modelers have explored a wind interacting with a pre-existing\ndisk or torus (e.g., Frank et al. 1995; Martin & Arnett 1995;\nBlondin & Lundqvist 1993). However, these simulations generally placed the constricting torus at a large distance from\nthe ejection, rather than an accretion torus within a few stellar radii, and they adopted a continuous wind that rams into\nthe torus rather than a sudden ejection (these simulations\n\u2013 usually in two dimensions \u2013 also do not account for the\nobstruction of a supergiant companion star, of course). The\nsudden ejection is key for both the ring structure and the\nazimuthal asymmetry. The potential for a sudden ejection\nby the secondary to account for the structure in RY Scuti's\ncircumstellar nebula motivates our speculation in \u00a75.3 regarding possible physical causes of an outburst from the\naccreting secondary.3\n5.2\n\nSignificance in Pre-Supernova Evolution, and\nPost-RLOF Binaries as B[e] Supergiants\n\nDespite the recent episodes of mass ejection, estimates of the\nnebular mass compared to the amount of mass exchanged\n3\n\nNote that the apparent thicknesses of the rings and dust torus,\nwhich are 20\u201325% of their respective radii, may simply be due to\nthe sound speed multiplied by their ages. The radial expansion\nspeeds are 40\u201350 km s\u22121 , which is 4\u20135 times the sound speed\nwhen the ejected gas is ionised. In other words, they are as thin\nas they can be, even for an instantaneous ejection.\n\nbetween the stars suggests that RLOF has been mostly conservative so far for RY Scuti. The mass of the inner ionised\ngas torus is roughly 0.003 M\u2299 (Smith et al. 2002), while the\nmass of the outer dusty torus (from the measured dust mass\nmultiplied by an assumed gas:dust mass ratio of 100 adopted\nby those authors) is at least 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299 (Gehrz et al.\n2001). Thus, the total mass detected in the two-component\ntoroidal nebula around RY Scuti is only of order 0.003 M\u2299 .\nThis is admittedly a lower limit to the total mass lost, since\nthere may be dense clumps of neutral gas not measured in\nthe tracers of ionised gas. There could also be more mass\nin the equatorial plane at larger distances that is shielded\nfrom the star's radiation by the inner components of the\nnebula, but this mass has not been constrained by any previous study. In any case, the nebular mass ejected in the\npast \u223c104 yr is probably far less than 1 M\u2299 . With a current\nstellar-wind mass-loss rate of around (1\u20132) \u00d710\u22126 M\u2299 yr\u22121\n(typical for the wind of an O9 supergiant; Repolust et al.\n2004), the mass lost in a fast line-driven stellar wind during this time should be comparable to that in the ionised\nnebula.\nAs noted in the introduction, however, modern observed\nparameters for RY Scuti favour present-day masses of \u223c30\nM\u2299 for the secondary, and \u223c8 M\u2299 for the primary (originally the more massive star). Since the likely initial masses\nwere of order 25 and 15 M\u2299 , this suggests that about 15 M\u2299\nhas been shifted from the primary to the secondary during\nthe brief (\u223c104 yr) RLOF phase, whereas much less than\n1 M\u2299 appears to have been lost from the system during\nthat same time. From these rough observational estimates,\n\n\f12\n\nSmith et al.\n\nwe conjecture that the mass transfer in RY Scuti has been\nlargely conservative - that is, unless a large amount of nebular material resides in the equatorial plane outside the dust\ntorus where it may be shielded, and may therefore remain\ncold and largely neutral. Observations at far-IR and submm\nwavelengths may help constrain the amount of additional\ncold material in the system.\nWhile conservative mass transfer rather than mass loss\nappears to dominate the stripping of the donor star's H envelope, the mass ejected into an equatorial torus may play\nan important role in angular momentum loss. The resulting\ndusty toroid or ring may have observable consequences after\nthe short phase of RLOF is complete, as noted earlier.\nIn the RY Scuti system, the primary has transferred\nmuch of its mass to the secondary, which as a result, is seen\nas a disk-enshrouded O-type supergiant star that will now\nbe overluminous for its initial mass, and will be rapidly rotating due to the additional angular momentum of the accreted mass (see below). Eventually, when the opaque disk\ndissipates and thins, the secondary will be much brighter\nat visual wavelengths than its hotter WR-like primary that\nwill have lost its envelope, it will have substantially reduced\nits mass and luminosity, and it will then radiate most of its\nluminosity in the far-UV. Thus, when RLOF is finished and\nthe primary finally becomes a WR-like star depleted of H,\nthe overluminous secondary might outshine the primary at\nvisual wavelengths. Due to the presence of recently ejected\ncircumstellar material in a surrounding nebula, the system\nwill continue to have bright emission lines, radio emission,\nand IR excess from dust. In many observable respects, the\nsystem may therefore resemble a B[e] supergiant (e.g., Zickgraf et al. 1996).\nIf the primary in RY Scuti is, in fact, destined to die\nas a Type Ib/c SN, then it provides us with a real example of what binary progenitors of SNe Ib/c may look like.\nAdditionally, SNe IIb are closely related to SNe Ib, except\nthat they have a small residual H envelope; RY Scuti could\ntherefore also die as a SN IIb if it fails to completely shed its\nouter H layers before core collapse. In that case, it provides\nus with a Galactic analog to the progenitor of the Type IIb\nexplosion SN 1993J in M81 (Filippenko et al. 1994), which\nwas inferred to be a close binary system of slightly lower\ninitil mass that experienced an almost identical binary evolutionary path (Maund et al. 2004; see also Aldering et al.\n1994; Van Dyk et al. 2002).\nA distant extragalactic observer who witnesses the SN\nresulting from the explosion of the primary in RY Scuti\nmight be able to infer, from appropriate pre-explosion\narchival data, that there was a blue star with M V \u2248 \u22126\nmag at the same position before the SN. This would not\nhave beeen the SN progenitor itself, but the overluminous\nmass-gainer secondary in the close binary system. The alien\nobserver could verify this conjecture with late-time observations showing that the blue star was not destroyed in the\nSN explosion. The observer might infer from single-star evolution models that this star had a ZAMS mass of \u223c 30 M\u2299 ,\nwhen in fact the masses of the primary and secondary have\nbeen substantially altered by RLOF. In this case, however,\nit would be a mistake to disregard this surviving source as a\nchance coincidence, since the overluminous blue companion\nprovides an important clue that the primary was stripped of\nits H envelope via RLOF in a close binary system. Indeed,\n\nMaund et al. (2004) identified a massive blue star that might\nhave been the surviving mass-gainer companion to the star\nthat exploded as SN 1993J.\nWith only \u223c 0.003 M\u2299 of ejected gas in the immediate\ncircumstellar environment, the shock interaction with the\nsurrounding torus will not be strong enough to produce a\nType IIn supernova (see Smith et al. 2009). Thus, the resulting explosion from the primary in RY Scuti will likely\nbe a Type Ib, or perhaps a Type IIb event like SN 1993J,\ndepending on whether all or nearly all of the H envelope is\ntransferred from the primary to the secondary. However, an\ninteresting consequence of the toriodal circumstellar nebula\naround RY Scuti is that the resulting SN might produce a\nstrong IR echo, due to the circumstellar dust getting heated\nby the SN's pulse of UV/optical luminosity.\n5.3\n\nOutbursts from the Accreting Secondary and\nMassive RLOF Binaries as Optical Transients\n\nOur study provides empirical evidence that the masstransfer phase in massive binaries can in some cases be accompanied by episodic bursts of mass ejection, rather than\njust a continuous and steady transfer of mass. Here we speculate about the underlying physical cause of the outbursts,\nand we speculate about possible observed consequences of\nthese events.\nPrevious studies of RY Scuti suggest that the initially\nmore massive star (\u223c25 M\u2299 ) has shed much of its H envelope, leaving an 8 M\u2299 stripped-envelope star. The secondary,\ninitially the less massive of the two, has already accreted 10\u2013\n15 M\u2299 through an accretion disk, yielding a 30 M\u2299 star that\nis still largely obscured by its surrounding accretion torus.\nIt is probable that the accreting secondary in such a system\nwill be significantly spun up due to mass and angular momentum accretion, and may therefore be at or near critical\nrotation (e.g., Struve 1963; Packet 1981; Langer & Petrovich\n2007; Vanbeveren et al. 1998; Langer et al. 2008). Indeed, estimates suggest that accreting even a few to 10% of a star's\nmass via an accretion disk in RLOF is enough to spin up\na star to near the critical rotation limit (Packet 1981; Vanbeveren et al. 1998), and this is one of the leading ideas for\nthe formation of Be stars in binary systems (e.g., Gies 2007;\nDewi 2007). The secondary star in RY Scuti has accreted a\nlarge fraction of its current stellar mass (roughly half), suggesting that it must have already encountered an angular\nmomentum catastrophe where it has reached critical rotation, perhaps repeatedly on several occasions. Moreover, the\naddition of mass and heating of the envelope via accretion\nluminosity on a short RLOF timescale of less than 104 yr\n[shorter than the (2\u20133) \u00d7104 yr KH time of the entire star]\nmay leave the envelope overluminous and out of thermal\nequilibrium with the core. Unfortunately, this is difficult to\ntest directly, since the secondary in the RY Scuti system is\nhidden by an opaque accretion disk in its present state.\nWhile in this rapidly rotating nonequilibrium configuration, the accreting secondary star may be subject to a\nquasi-cyclical instability whose recurrence is set by either\nthe angular momentum diffusion timescale or the thermal\ntimescale in the star's outer envelope, coupled to the mass\nand angular momentum accretion rate. The situation is reminiscent of rotational and thermal instabilities discussed for\nthe envelopes of LBVs (Appenzeller 1986; Stothers 2000;\n\n\fMultiple Ejections from RY Scuti\nGuzik et al. 1999; Davidson 1999; Smith et al. 2003). One\nexample of these is the so-called Omega limit (Langer 1997,\n1998; see also Glatzel 1998), where critical rotation combined with high luminosity leads to violent mass ejections\nfrom a massive star. Shedding mass and angular momentum in a shell ejection could temporarily alleviate the state\nof critical rotation - but if the angular momentum of the\nsecondary is continually replenished with an accretion disk\nin RLOF, that star could repeatedly be driven to critical rotation and may therefore encounter recurring shell ejections.\nWe suspect that this scenario might lead to repeated mass\nejections like those experienced by RY Scuti. With a very\nhigh mass-transfer rate of order 10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (i.e., 10\u201315\nM\u2299 during the RLOF phase of \u223c 104 yr), the secondary\nof RY Scuti will accrete about 0.1 M\u2299 over the observed\ntime interval of \u223c120 yr between mass ejections. This mass\ngained with high specific angular momentum at the equator\nis more than the amount of mass lost during the same time\ninterval, suggesting that it is enough to replenish the amount\nof angular momentum that was lost, and would therefore be\nsufficient to drive the star back to critical rotation. Further\nwork on thermal and dynamical instabilities in the envelopes\nof rapidly rotating accreting secondaries in binaries would\nbe of considerable interest. In particular, a detailed dynamical treatment of the rotating stellar envelope is needed to\nconstrain the physics of the instability and whether it can\nlead to a sudden outburst. If so, it might provide a possible\nexplanation for the origin of LBV eruptions that occur in\nbinary systems.\nRecall that our suggestion is motivated in part by the\nfact that invoking repeated sudden outbursts from the accreting secondary star provides a reasonable explanation for\nseveral observed properties of RY Scuti's nebula, including\nits double-ring toroidal nebula, its azimuthal asymmetry,\nand the fact that its repeated mass ejections that occurred\n\u223c250 and \u223c130 yr ago both had similar geometry. The\nslower leaking of mass through the outer L2 point provides\nfor equatorially enhanced mass loss, but does not seem to account for other observed properties of the system (see \u00a75.1).\nIn the case of RY Scuti, the amount of mass lost appears to\nbe much smaller than the amount of mass transferred from\nthe primary to the secondary (i.e., recent RLOF appears to\nbe nearly conservative in the case of RY Scuti).\nSudden mass ejections are often accompanied by luminous outbursts akin to the giant eruptions observed in LBVs.\nThere is a wide diversity of LBV-like eruptions, sometimes\ncalled \"SN impostors,\" which has been reviewed recently by\nSmith et al. (2011). The famous massive binaries \u03b7 Car and\nHD 5980 both suffered LBV giant eruption events. There\nare a number of other events for which we do not know\nwhether the progenitors are in binary systems, but two recent examples, SN 2000ch and SN 2009ip, have exhibited\nrepeating LBV-like outbursts (Pastorello et al. 2010; Smith\net al. 2011). Although the underlying cause of eruptions is\nnot known, \u03b7 Car exhibited brief luminous peaks in the light\ncurve at times of periastron in the eccentric binary (Smith\n& Frew 2011; Smith 2011). These reached absolute magnitudes of roughly \u221214 mag and lasted for about 100 days,\nvery similar to several other SN impostors. The relatively\nsmall (0.003 M\u2299 ) mass ejections of RY Scuti are not known\nto have coincided with a major brightening event, but brief\noutbursts in the 18th and 19th centuries might easily have\n\n13\n\nbeen missed if the brightening lasted only a few days. Other\nmore extreme mass ejections in binaries are possible and do\ncoincide with major brightening events.\nWe therefore speculate that some events in the population of observed extragalactic SN impostors could be related\nto mass ejections that are caused by an instability associated with mass and angular momentum accretion, similar\nto the one we outlined above for RY Scuti. Whether this is\ntrue requires more detailed theoretical study of the dynamical and thermal stability of accreting stars in RLOF. This\nhypothesis has the advantage that accretion-induced critical rotation can be reached for the mass gainers over a wide\nrange in initial masses, not limited to the most massive stars\nnear the Eddington limit. Many of the SN impostors and\nrelated transients appear to arise from stellar systems with\ninitial masses below 20 M\u2299 (see Smith et al. 2011 and references therein), and this has been difficult to understand in\nthe context of LBV eruptions. RY Scuti presents a concrete\nexample of a RLOF system that has experienced repeating\nsudden mass ejections where the mass gainer is known to be\nsurrounded by an accretion torus.\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe briefly summarise the main observational conclusions\nand their implications from our study of the expansion of\nRY Scuti's nebula.\n(1) The expansion age of the inner ionised rings measured using HST images indicates an ejection date of roughly\n1881 (\u00b14 yr).\n(2) The expansion age of the outer dusty IR torus measured using Keck AO images yields a likely ejection year of\n1754 (\u00b136 yr).\n(3) We therefore conclude that the two components of\nRY Scuti's nebula (the inner ionised rings and the outer\ndust torus) were the result of two separate ejection events\nrecurring on a timescale of \u223c 120\u2013130 yr. One may wonder\nwhether RY Scuti is due for another such ejection event in\nthe near future.\n(4) Conclusion (3) is supported by a clear spatial gap\nbetween the two structural components, indicating that they\nare not interacting hydrodynamically. Therefore, one cannot\ninvoke a distant pre-existing disk as the shaping mechanism\nfor the double-ring nebula. This gap also indicates that few\nionising photons can penetrate the inner ionised rings. We\nspeculate that the second ejection event, which is now seen\nas the expanding ionised rings in HST images, may have\nshielded the outer torus from the stars' ionising radiation,\nthereby allowing dust to form in the outer torus.\n(5) We suggest a formation mechanism for the toroidal\ncircumstellar nebula that involves matter ejected suddenly\n(i.e., dynamically) by the accreting secondary star, and immediately being shaped by the opaque accretion torus that\nis thought to surround the secondary star, although we encourage numerical simulations of this scenario.\n(6) The primary star in RY Scuti, which is in the process of losing its H envelope via RLOF, is our best-studied\ncandidate for the progenitor of a Type IIb or Type Ibc supernova where the envelope stripping from close binary evolution is currently underway. While other post-RLOF systems\nare good candidates for SNe Ibc as well, RY Scuti is a rare\n\n\f14\n\nSmith et al.\n\nexample of a system that is currently in the critical mass\ntransfer phase, and which is surrounded by a nebula that\nallows us to measure the mass lost from the system.\n(7) RY Scuti suggests, therefore, that the formation of\nSN Ibc progenitors via RLOF may in some cases be punctuated by sudden, repeating episodes of mass loss. We speculate that this may be the result of an instability associated\nwith mass and angular momentum accretion by the secondary star, although this idea deserves additional study.\nIn some cases these mass-ejection events may be seen as\nluminous outbursts, even though we are aware of no such\nrecord of an observed outburst in the specific case of RY\nScuti. It is worth considering the possibility that other close\nbinary systems may contribute to the diverse population of\nnon-supernova optical transients now being discovered.\n(8) When RLOF finishes for RY Scuti, we speculate that\nthe accretion torus around the secondary will become optically thin, revealing the rapidly rotating and overluminous\nmass gainer. The system will also be surrounded by a dusty\ntorus resembling those seen in B[e] stars. If this overluminous 30 M\u2299 secondary star dominates the optical luminosity\nof the system, it may point toward an observed association\nbetween OB emission-line stars and some SN Ibc progenitors, even though it is the companion to the overluminous\nOB star that actually explodes.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nSupport was provided by the National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration (NASA) through grants GO-11977, GO8209, and GO-6492 from the Space Telescope Science Institute,\nwhich is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS526555.
