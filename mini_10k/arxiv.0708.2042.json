We present a comprehensive study of the observational dependence of the mass-loss rate in stationary stellar winds\n\nof hot massive stars on the metal content of their atmospheres. The metal content of stars in the Magellanic Clouds is discussed,\nand a critical assessment is given of state-of-the-art mass-loss determinations of OB stars in these two satellite systems and the\nMilky-Way. Assuming a power-law dependence of mass loss on metal content, \u1e40 \u221d Z m , and adopting a theoretical relation\nbetween the terminal flow velocity and metal content, v\u221e \u221d Z 0.13 (Leitherer et al. 1992), we find m = 0.83 \u00b1 0.16 for nonclumped outflows from an analysis of the wind momentum luminosity relation (WLR) for stars more luminous than 105.2 L .\nWithin the errors, this result is in agreement with the prediction m = 0.69 \u00b1 0.10 by Vink et al. (2001). Absolute empirical\nvalues for the mass loss, based on H\u03b1 and ultraviolet (UV) wind lines, are found to be a factor of two higher than predictions in\nthis high luminosity regime. If this difference is attributed to inhomogeneities in the wind, and this clumping does not impact\nthe predictions, this would imply that luminous O and early-B stars have clumping factors in their H\u03b1 and UV line forming\nregions of about a factor of four. For lower luminosity stars, the winds are so weak that their strengths can generally no longer\nbe derived from optical spectral lines (essentially H\u03b1) and one must currently rely on the analysis of UV lines. We confirm that\nin this low-luminosity domain the observed Galactic WLR is found to be much steeper than expected from theory (although\nthe specific sample is rather small), leading to a discrepancy between UV mass-loss rates and the predictions by a factor 100\nat luminosities of L \u223c 104.75 L , the origin of which is unknown. We emphasize that even if the current mass-loss rates of hot\nluminous stars would turn out to be overestimated as a result of wind clumping, but the degree of clumping would be rather\nindependent of metallicity, the scalings derived in this study are expected to remain correct.\n\nwords. stars:early-type \u2013 stars:mass loss\nstars:atmospheres \u2013 stars: fundamental parameters\nMagellanic Clouds\nKey\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n1. Introduction\nUnderstanding the properties and evolution of massive stars\nin low metallicity environments is of fundamental importance\nin astrophysics. This is amply illustrated by referring to the\nanticipated role of massive stars in the early universe, where\nthey are thought to be responsible for its re-ionization (e.g.\n\nHaehnelt et al. 2001; Wyithe & Loeb 2003), galaxy formation, and chemical evolution of young galaxies and of the intragalaxy medium. Strong indications of gamma-ray bursts occurring primarily at low metallicity (e.g. Gorosabel et al. 2005)\nand massive stars being progenitors (e.g. Hjorth et al. 2003),\nadds to the point. To a large extent, the evolution of massive\nstars is controlled by the effects of mass loss, therefore mass\nloss has a direct and/or indirect impact on all the phenomena\nmentioned above. This makes a quantitative handle on the dependence of mass loss on the metal content of the environment\n\n\f2\n\nM. R. Mokiem et al.: The emperical \u1e40(Z) dependence of O and early-B stars\n\nout of which these early stars form so vital. Obviously this argument also applies to massive stars in the local universe.\nIn the last decade the development of realistic stellar atmosphere models has allowed accurate determination of the\nwind parameters of a sizeable sample of early-type Galactic\nstars (e.g. Puls et al. 1996; Herrero et al. 2002; Repolust et al.\n2004; Crowther et al. 2006). This, in turn, has allowed us to\ntest our understanding of aspects of stellar wind hydrodynamics, including its driving mechanism, to an unprecedented level.\nDuring this period new instrumentation developements on large\ntelescopes have resulted in significant numbers of extragalactic stars being spectroscopically studied. Examples of extensive\nsurveys are those of Massey et al. (2004, 2005) and of Evans\net al. (2005), although there are many others and the relevant\nones will be discussed later. The latter program is the VLTFLAMES Survey of Massive Stars, in which close to 100 O- and\nearly B-type stars were observed in the Magellanic Clouds. The\ninclusion of line blocking/blanketing in the modeling of hot\nstar atmospheres (e.g. Hubeny & Lanz 1995; Hillier & Miller\n1998) allows for a consistent description of the effects from\nvast numbers of overlapping metal lines, particularly regarding a detailed treatment of the effects of chemical composition,\nand has paved the way for a robust quantitative comparison of\nthe wind strengths of hot massive stars in different metallicity environments. The most recent step forward in the modeling technique has been the development of an automated fitting\nmethod, opening up a means to analyse large samples in a homogeneous way (Mokiem et al. 2005).\nThis paper provides a critical assessment of the current\nstanding of mass-loss determinations in the Galaxy and the\nLarge and Small Magellanic Clouds, and is specifically aimed\nat establishing the dependence of mass loss on the chemical abundance pattern, notably metal content Z. The Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC) with Z at about 1/5th of the Galactic\nvalue is the lowest metallicity we can so far probe in reasonable\ndetail. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with approximately\nhalf the metal content of the Galaxy provides an intermediate\nenvironment.\nThe only possibility, in the forseeable future, of studying\nstars in environments with significantly lower metallicity than\nthe SMC is the massive stellar populations of the Local Group\ndwarfs GR8, Sextans A and Leo A. These three galaxies have\nmetallicities betweem 0.1 and 0.05 Z , but their low starformation rates and distances of around 1-2 Mpc makes studies of\nlarge numbers of young massive stars extremely difficult. Given\nthis difficulty of establishing the dependence of mass-loss rates\nupon metallicity below 1/5 Z , we must rely on predictions to\naccess this interesting part of parameter space. Although we\ndo not deal with the theory of wind driving mechanism, we\nwill compare predicted and observed wind strengths to establish successes and failures of the theory such that we may identify aspects of the \u1e40(Z) problem that require further study, and\nregimes in parameter space that seem sufficiently under control\nto allow us to venture out to lower metallicity regimes and the\nearly universe (see also Vink & de Koter 2005).\nIn Sect. 2 we briefly review the mass-loss mechanism\nof early-type stars. The present day chemical composition of\nthe Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds is discussed in Sect. 3.\n\nTable 1.

The observed mass-loss relations are presented in Sect. 6. On these relations the global metallicity dependence of \u1e40 is determined in Sect. 7. Finally, in Sect. 8 we\ndiscuss the observed mass-loss relations in terms of the socalled weak wind problem and wind clumping, and end with\nconcluding remarks.\n\n2. The mass-loss mechanism of early-type stars\nWe briefly review those aspects of the wind driving mechanism\nof massive early-type stars that are relevant in the context of establishing an empirical relation between mass loss and chemical composition. For a more in-depth treatment of the physics\nof mass loss, see e.g. Kudritzki & Puls (2000) and Vink et al.\n(2001). The basic mechanism driving the winds of hot massive stars is the transfer of momentum from photons to the\natmospheric gas by line interactions. The driving mechanism\nimplies that the properties of the stellar wind will depend on\nthe number of photons per second streaming through the photospheric layers (reflecting the stellar luminosity), and on the\nnumber and ability of lines being available \u2013 in particular at\nwavelengths around the photospheric flux maximum \u2013 to absorb or scatter these photons.\nThe dependence of the wind driving on the number of lines\npresent suggests that mass loss is a function of elemental abundance. Whether this is indeed the case formally depends on the\nnature of the driving lines. In the hypothetical case that one\nwould be in a regime of abundances for which all lines effectively contributing to the line force are optically thick, mass\nloss would not be a function of elemental abundance. This\nregime is not encountered in even the most metal rich environ-\n\n\fM. R. Mokiem et al.: The emperical \u1e40(Z) dependence of O and early-B stars\n\nments known (Vink et al. 2001). In reality, it is found that the\nlines driving the wind are a mixture of optically thin and optically thick lines. Representing the distribution of line strengths\nby a power law, one predicts, for Galactic O stars, a ratio of\nthe line acceleration from optically thick lines to the total line\nacceleration of \u03b1 \u223c 2/3 (see Puls et al. 2000), where an even\nlarger contribution by optically thick lines would increase this\nvalue (and vice versa). This ensures a dependence of mass loss\non elemental abundance.\nWhich elements dominate the line force? The answer depends on the effective temperature of the star. (More precisely:\non the radiation and electron temperature in the wind acceleration regime; see also Vink et al. 1999; Puls et al. 2000).\nAlthough hydrogen and helium are by far the most abundant\nelements, their impact on the wind driving is modest. Decisive\nfor whether or not a species is a significant contributor to the\nline driving is the product: abundance \u00d7 ionisation fraction \u00d7\nnumber of effective lines. Very roughly, the elemental abundance times the ionisation fraction of hydrogen and helium are\nsimilar to that of metals that are in the dominant stage of ionisation. It is therefore the number of driving lines that is decisive.\nAs H and He \u2013 due to their simple atomic structure \u2013 have only\nfew lines that can effectively contribute to the line force, it is\nrelatively abundant complex atoms that are the main contributors.\nWe estimate the relative contributions of the different elements by the use of a Monte Carlo method (Abbott & Lucy\n1985; de Koter et al. 1997; Vink et al. 1999) that calculates\nthe total momentum transfer from the radiation field to the outflowing gas particles. Although the relative contribution to the\nline force is depth-dependent (see below), here we simply register the atomic number of the elements with which the photons\ninteract somewhere in the wind, and we present the results in\nTab. 1. For a late-O dwarf of solar composition, CNO accounts\nfor some 15 percent; iron contributes some 25 percent. Other\niron-group elements (for instance Cr, Mn, Co, Ni) add a few\npercent. \u03b1-elements, such as Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, and Ca account\nfor about 30 %, with Si being the main contributor with \u223c 20 %.\nWe mention a decomposition of the line force in terms of iron\ngroup and \u03b1 elements as their nucleosynthetic origin is different. The former are mostly produced in thermonuclear Type\nIa supernovae, the latter predominantly in core-collapse supernovae of types II and Ib/c. Beware that due to their different\nelectronic structure specific groups of elements have a different line-strength statistics, and dominate the line acceleration\nat different depths: iron group elements have a somewhat larger\ninfluence on the mass-loss rate, whereas lighter ions dominate\nthe acceleration in the outer wind, thus controlling the terminal\nvelocity (cf. Vink et al. 1999; Puls et al. 2000). These more subtle effects are not reflected in the statistics provided in Table 1.\nMixing of CNO-cycled material to the surface during the\nsupergiant phase may affect the relative abundances of these\nthree elements. However, in terms of their contribution to the\nline force not much will change when this happens, as these\nthree elements have more or less equal numbers of effective driving lines near the photospheric flux maximum and\nthe C+N+O abundance remains unaffected by the CNO-cycle\n(Vink & de Koter 2002).\n\n3\n\nAccounting for the fact that we are interested in the gross\ndependence of wind parameters on metallicity, and particularly\nin the product of mass-loss rate and terminal velocity (see below), we conclude that a straight mean of C+N+O, \u03b1-elements,\nand iron-group elements is an appropriate abundance value to\nuse as a Z measure for O stars. For stars of spectral type B and\nA the contribution of iron increases to up to 50 percent.\n\n3. Metallicity determinations of early-type stars\nHaving identified the elements that dominate the line force, we\nnow address the present-day chemical composition of hot massive stars in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds.\nSpectroscopy of H ii regions and supernova remnants have\nbeen used to probe the gas phase composition of the Magellanic\nClouds (for reviews see for instance Pagel et al. 1978; Dufour\n1990; Russell & Dopita 1990; Garnett 1999). The results derived from these studies do not necessarily represent the initial chemical composition of the stars in these environments\nbecause of fractionation of some elements from the gas phase\nonto solid state particles (or \"dust\"). Also, emission line studies may be affected by spatial inhomogeneities in the nebula.\nTherefore, to obtain the appropriate chemical composition of\nthe winds we are studying it would be pertinent to determine\nthe photospheric abundances of the massive stellar populations\nin the Clouds. As the comparison between theoretical and observed wind strength is usually not done on an individual basis (but see de Koter et al. 1997) it is relevant to specify how\nthe observed metal abundance Z \u2013 so far the abundance input\nparameter for mass-loss predictions \u2013 is derived. If Z is derived from CNO abundances in either evolved or rapidly rotating objects one should be careful. In supergiants and even\ngiants (Korn et al. 2000; Lennon et al. 2003) rotational mixing\nand ejection of the outermost envelope by mass loss may bring\nCNO equilibrium material to the surface. In stars rotating at\nabout half of break-up at the surface or more, abundance alterations due to rotational mixing may already occur very early\non in the stars evolution (Yoon & Langer 2005).\nThe optical spectra of O stars show few spectral lines of\nheavy elements. B stars are relatively rich in absorption features due to C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Fe providing a sound\nbasis for establishing the metallicity, although we note that the\nFe lines are intrinsically quite weak (especially so in the SMC;\nRolleston et al. 2003). The advantage of B and later-type dwarf\nand giant stars is also that they may be analysed accurately using non-LTE line-blanketed hydrostatic atmospheres, without\nwinds.\nA major goal of the VLT-FLAMES survey of massive stars\n(Evans et al. 2005) was to observe a large number of such Btype stars in the same vicinity as the O-stars to determine their\nphotospheric abundances. Hunter et al. (2007) and Trundle\net al. (2007) have presented the chemical compositions of\n34 and 53 B-type stars in the SMC and LMC respectively.\nThese are the narrow lined stars from the FLAMES survey,\nwith the highest signal-to-noise spectra, analysed with the lineblanketed non-LTE code tlusty. These authors determined the\nbest estimates for the chemical composition of the Clouds from\na comparison of results from stellar and nebular work, and we\n\n\f4\n\nM. R.

The non-LTE\nabsolute abundances for C, N, O, Mg, and Si are quoted, along\nwith the simple difference between these absolute values and\nthe current standard solar abundances of Asplund et al. (2005).\nHowever detailed non-LTE model atoms for use in calculating\nline profiles for Al, S and Fe in tlusty are required to allow\nreliable line abundances to be calculated consistently in nonLTE. The results for Fe are taken from Trundle et al. (2007) in\nwhich a non-LTE atmosphere and LTE line formation calculations were used. The results for Al and S are taken from the\nLTE B-star analysis of Rolleston et al. (2003) and Rolleston\net al. (2002). Because we are less certain of the validity of\nthe absolute values of the LTE results, we quote the differential abundances from these papers which were determined from\nanalysing Galactic B-stars with identical atmospheric parameters. We should also note that the Rolleston et al. (2003) abundances come from the analysis of a single star AV304, and the\nLMC results are from 5 stars with spectra of modest signal-tonoise.\nThe SMC abundance of the \u03b1 elements (O, Mg, Si) has a\nmean relative to solar of \u2206[\u03b1/H] = \u22120.7 \u00b1 0.1 dex. The differential LTE result of Al is in good agreement with this value,\nalthough the one S abundance from the star AV304 is somewhat higher. The Fe abundance is \u2206[Fe/H] = \u22120.57 \u00b1 0.16 dex,\nwhich, within the uncertainties, is in agreement with the \u03b1\nelements. The SMC Fe abundance has also been determined\nthrough studies of AFGK supergiants, which have more and\nstronger metal lines in their spectra and for which non-LTE\neffects are less important. They tend to show very good agreement at \u2206[Fe/H] = \u22120.60\u00b10.1 dex (Venn 1999). Differences in\nmodelling techniques/codes, diagnostic lines, and atomic data\nwill clearly lead to systematic differences between the sets of\nresults. The discrepancies between different analyses are becoming smaller, but have not completely been resolved and\nprogress is required in the model atmosphere and line formation codes, particularly with regard to atomic data for S, Al\nand Fe for B-star analysis. We adopt \u2206[Z/H] \u223c \u22120.7 \u00b1 0.1 for\nthe SMC, but will discuss the effects of a potentially different\nmetallicity later (see Sect. 7.2).\nThe abundance of the \u03b1 elements in the LMC relative to\nsolar from Hunter et al. (2007) and Trundle et al. (2007) is\n\nSMC\n12 + log X/H \u2206[X/H]\n7.37\n\u22121.02\n6.50\n\u22121.28\n7.98\n\u22120.68\n6.72\n\u22120.81\n5.43\n\u22120.72\n6.79\n\u22120.72\n6.44\n\u22120.42\n6.93\n\u22120.57\n\n\u2206[\u03b1/H] = \u22120.36 \u00b1 0.1 dex. An extensive comparison of abundance determinations in the LMC was compiled by Rolleston\net al. (2002). Reasonable agreement is found between six independent studies of the overall metallicity of the LMC \u2013 irrespective of the class of object used to trace the chemical composition or the spatial location of the investigated stars. The\nmean metallicity, based on O and Si, is (\u2206[O/H]+\u2206[Si/H)/2 =\n\u22120.30 \u00b1 0.08 dex. Some previous analyses using OB stars\nseem to indicate that iron is less deficient than the \u03b1-elements.\nRolleston et al. (2002) report an \u03b1 to iron ratio \u2206[\u03b1/Fe] \u223c\n\u22120.14 dex for main sequence OB stars, consistent with that obtained for evolved B-stars (Korn et al. 2000). However Trundle\net al. (2007) determine a mean differential Fe abundance of\n\u22120.29 \u00b1 0.15 for 13 stars of their sample in NGC2004, in good\nagreement with the depletions of O, Mg and Si. Studies using\nF supergiants and Cepheids, however, report iron abundances\nrepresentative of the mean metallicity (Hill et al. 1995; Luck\net al. 1998). In this study, we adopt \u2206[Z/H] \u223c \u22120.3 \u00b1 0.1 for\nthe LMC.\nWe note that for C and N the values in Hunter et al. (2007)\nare the best estimates of the baseline abundances in the Clouds.\nI.e. they are estimates of the C and N when the stars are born\nand before any rotational mixing has caused the photospheric\nabundances to change. It has been clear for some time that C\nand N are significantly underabundant in the Clouds in comparison to the heavier elements. This may have an effect on the\nwind strengths of the hottest stars where CNO (mainly C) is a\nsignificant contributor to the line force. (see Table 1).\n\n4. Mass-loss determinations of early-type stars\nDuring recent years, three basic diagnostics to derive the massloss rate of early-type stars have been employed. These are: (a)\ninfrared, millimetre and radio excess due to free-free processes;\n(b) ultraviolet resonance lines, and (c) optical lines, notably\nH\u03b1, but for the hottest stars also He ii \u03bb4686. For a didactic\nexplanation of the way in which \u1e40 can be derived from these\ndiagnostics, see Lamers & Cassinelli (1999). In the context of\nthe dependence of mass loss on metal content, millimetre and\nradio excess emission in early-type stars is (at this moment)\nimpracticable as the flux levels are weak and can only be mea-\n\n\fM. R. Mokiem et al.: The emperical \u1e40(Z) dependence of O and early-B stars\n\nsured for not too distant Galactic stars (up to a few kiloparsec),\ni.e. the method can not be applied to Magellanic Cloud stars.\nUV resonance lines of relatively abundant elements such as\nC, N, O and Si are the most sensitive probes of mass loss, allowing detection of rates as low as \u223c 10\u22129 M yr\u22121 . The lines\ntypically saturate at about \u223c 10\u22127 M yr\u22121 , therefore for strong\nwinds they only provide lower limits to \u1e40. Because of the ease\nwith which the lines saturate, unsaturated lines often relate to\nminor ionisation stages (and/or, obviously, to weak winds). The\nionisation of these trace ions may depend rather critically on\nthe treatment of line-blanketing, clumping, and shocks. Over\nthe past decade, line-blanketing has been incorporated into\nmodel atmosphere codes for hot stars with winds. In a detailed\ncomparison of three of these codes, Puls et al. (2005) conclude that the flux levels at \u03bb & 400 \u00c5 agree very well. Below\n400 \u00c5, discrepancies are found, implying that the population\nof species such as N iv, C iv, and O vi should be taken with\ncare, as should the mass-loss rates derived using these ions.\nOne of the most important current challenges in model atmospheres treating outflows is to implement the direct and indirect\neffects of the line-driven instability (see e.g. Lucy & Solomon\n1970; Owocki 1994, and references therein). This instability\ncauses the formation of small scale density and velocity gradients in the wind flow, creating \"clumps\" of gas and shocks leading to X-ray emission and enhanced EUV-flux. We will discuss\nclumping in more detail in Sect. 8.2. Shocks may also impact\non the ionisation of the species mentioned above. This presents\na second reason for being cautious with the \u1e40 values derived\nfrom UV resonance lines of which the ionisation is affected by\nEUV and/or X-ray photons. A third reason to be cautious is that\nthe abundances of C, N, and O may be affected by the surfacing\nof nuclear processed material (see Sect. 3).\nThe third approach to derive the rate of mass loss is by fitting the H\u03b1 profile, and, for stars of roughly spectral type O5 or\nearlier, He ii \u03bb4686. The advantages of fitting these lines compared to ultraviolet resonance lines are that i) the abundance\ndetermination is robust (for the most detailed approach, see\nMokiem et al. 2005, 2006); ii) at least for hydrogen, the ionisation balance is well known, i.e. it is not affected by shock\nprocesses (which might still be a problem for helium). On the\ndown side however, the H\u03b1 diagnostic is not as sensitive as are\nthe UV lines. For OB stars, only for mass-loss rates in excess\nof \u223c 10\u22127 M yr\u22121 can the contribution of wind emission to the\nH\u03b1 photospheric line be used to determine \u1e40. Even more, at\nsuch low wind densities the uncertainty about the velocity law\n(which cannot be constrained if the wind emission inside H\u03b1\nis low) introduces an additional ambiguity, which increases the\nerrors in the derived mass-loss rate considerably, up to factors\nof two to three (e.g., Puls et al. 1996).\nThis poses a challenge: the H\u03b1 and UV resonance line diagnostics have only a small mass-loss regime in common in\nwhich both techniques can be applied simultaneously. This\nis unfortunate in view of resolving the weak wind problem\n(see Sect. 8.1), although there may be alternative wind diagnostics. First, the Br\u03b1 line at 4.05 \u03bcm is intrinsically stronger\nthan H\u03b1 and could push the sensitivity of the hydrogen line\n\u1e40-diagnostic by possibly a factor two to three (Schaerer et al.\n1996; Lenorzer et al. 2004; Repolust et al. 2005) or even more\n\n5\n\n(as resulting from test calculations by JP and FN), providing\nsufficient overlap to derive \u1e40 from both methods for a reasonable number of stars. Second there is a P v resonance doublet\nat \u03bb\u03bb1118,1128 \u00c5. The abundance of phosphorus is about a\nfactor of 102 \u2212 103 less than that of C, N, O, and Si. As a result of this the line does not saturate as easily. Consequently,\nit can be applied to stars with \u1e40 in excess of 10\u22127 M yr\u22121\n(see e.g. Crowther et al. 2002; Hillier et al. 2003). Moreover,\nfor a range of O subtypes P v is expected to be the dominant\nionisation stage (for recent results, see Puls et al. 2007), making it less susceptible to shocks. Access to the far-ultraviolet\nregion of the spectrum is provided by, for instance, the Far\nUltraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer. Analysis of spectra obtained with this instrument strongly points to discrepant P v and\nH\u03b1 based mass-loss rates, suggestive of clumped winds (Massa\net al. 2003; Fullerton et al. 2006).\n\n5. Comparing \u1e40 in different environments\nHow should we compare the mass-loss rates of OB stars in different galaxies? The most straightforward way of doing this\nwould be to consider two stars with almost identical parameters\n\u2013 one in each galaxy \u2013 and directly compare their \u1e40 values.\nThere are two arguments against such an approach. The first\none is of a practicable nature. The number of O and early-B\nstars studied in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds is so far\ntoo limited to identify a significant number of stars with \"identical\" luminosity, temperature, mass, and to a lesser extent rotational and terminal wind velocity. The impact of stellar rotation\non mass loss appears important only for stars close to the \u03a9-\u0393\nlimit (e.g. Maeder & Meynet 2000 and Lamers 2004, and, e.g.,\nvan Boekel et al. 2003 and Smith et al. 2003 for the extreme\ncase of \u03b7 Carinae), therefore, for relatively \"normal\" early-type\nstars one may consider it less critical. Terminal velocity differences due to metallicity effects are found to be minor, both from\nobservational (e.g. Evans et al. 2004b) and theoretical (e.g. Puls\net al. 2000; Krti\u010dka 2006) considerations.\nEven if for a few cases one could perform such a direct\ncomparison, it would still not be an appealing approach, as the\n\u1e40(Z) relation may not necessarily be universal for all stellar\nparameters, and the result might not be applicable to all earlytype stars. Therefore, the second reason against an object-toobject comparison is that it may ignore potential physical arguments that would allow the entire parameter space of hot massive stars be used to establish the mass loss-metallicity relation,\nand that would add predictive power to the derived \u1e40(Z).\nIndeed the radiation-driven wind theory makes such predictions, and a powerful way to proceed is through the use of\nthe so-called modified wind momentum \u2013 luminosity relation,\n(WLR; e.g. Kudritzki et al. 1995; Kudritzki & Puls 2000)\n\u0010\n\u221a \u0011\n(1)\nlog Dmom \u2261 log \u1e40v\u221e R ' x log(L? /L ) + log D\u25e6 .\nIn this relation the slope x and the constant D\u25e6 are expected to\nvary as a function of spectral type and metal content (Kudritzki\net al. 1999; Vink et al. 2000; Puls et al. 2000). This equation expresses that the mechanical momentum of the stellar wind flow\nis primarily a function of photon momentum. It is perhaps surprising that the stellar mass does not feature in this dependence.\n\n\f6\n\nM. R. Mokiem et al.: The emperical \u1e40(Z) dependence of O and early-B stars\n\nThe reason is that log D\u25e6 contains a term \u221d (3/2 \u2212 x) log M,\nwhich (almost) vanishes since x happens to be \u223c 3/2 for Ostars and early B-supergiants (Puls et al. 2000). The uniqueness\nof the modified wind momentum relation has been confirmed\nby independent investigations (e.g Vink et al. 2000; Puls et al.\n2003). In Tab. 3 coefficients for the WLR as predicted by Vink\net al. (2000, 2001) are given for the Galactic, LMC and SMC\nmetallicities.\nAssuming the mass loss and terminal velocity are power\nlaws of metallicity, i.e.\n\u1e40 \u221d Z m\n\n(3)\n\nit follows that\n(m + n) = \u2206 log Dmom /\u2206 log Z\n\n6.1. Galaxy\n\n(2)\n\nand\nv\u221e \u221d Z n ,\n\nto a different WLR for such relatively cool stars. This excludes\nsome targets from the studies by Trundle et al. (2004); Trundle\n& Lennon (2005); Crowther et al. (2006). Finally, we did not\ninclude the entries from the comprehensive study of Markova\net al. (2004) because, with the exception of the mass-loss rates,\nthe stellar parameters were based on calibrations. We note however that the stellar parameters derived by these authors compare well with other studies.\n\n(4)\n\nThe index m may now be derived from a comparison of the\nmodified wind momentum for different galaxies, adopting for\ninstance the theoretical result n = 0.13 from Leitherer et al.\n(1992) to describe the v\u221e (Z) dependence. As the slope \u03b1 of the\nWLR is not identical (though similar) for different metallicities\none can not simply substitute the constant D\u25e6 (Z) for Dmom in\nthe above equation. What is required is a comparison of the\nactual Dmom at a chosen luminosity, using the uncertainty in\nthe WML relation at that specific L? (see Sect. 7.2).\n\n6. Observed mass-loss relations\nTo determine the empirical mass loss versus metallicity dependence, we compiled mass-loss rates and terminal velocity determinations from the literature, limiting ourselves to\nresults obtained with state-of-the-art modeling techniques using unified non-LTE line-blanketed stellar atmosphere models.\nInitially, we collected results obtained with four such codes:\nfastwind of Puls et al. (2005), cmfgen of Hillier & Miller\n(1998), wm-basic of Pauldrach et al. (2001), and isa-wind of\nde Koter et al. (1993, 1997). We decided not to use studies\nperformed with the latter two computer programmes (e.g. de\nKoter et al. 1994, 1998; Bianchi & Garcia 2002; Garcia &\nBianchi 2004) as these account for only a relatively minor fraction of the total number of stars investigated (some 20 percent)\nof which some have been reanalysed with either fastwind or\ncmfgen. This approach assures an extensive and relatively homogeneous dataset, but not to the limit that only one code is\nused. In this way we can still investigate potential (systematic)\ndifferences between at least two methods. Objects for which\nthe fastwind and cmfgen studies provided only upper limits on\nthe mass-loss rate are not included in the determination of the\nempirical WLRs, however they are included in the figures for\nreference and comparison purposes. We also limit the sample\nto stars with T eff > 24 kK. For lower effective temperatures,\na decrease in the terminal wind velocity is observed (Lamers\net al. 1995; Crowther et al. 2006), which may be accompanied\nby an increase in the mass-loss rate due to a change in the ionization balance of iron (Vink et al. 1999), potentially leading\n\nFor the Galaxy we consider a sample based on the analyses\nperformed by Repolust et al. (2004), Mokiem et al. (2005),\nMartins et al. (2005) and Crowther et al. (2006). Note that the\nsecond study includes a reanalysis of the Cyg OB2 stars analysed by Herrero et al. (2002), and HD 15629 and \u03b6 Oph studied\nby Repolust et al. The relevant atmospheric parameters adopting non-clumped mass-loss rates are listed in Tab. A.1. Two\nentries are given for HD 15629 and HD 93250, as they were\nanalysed separately using fastwind and cmfgen. In the following determination of the Galactic WLR, we adopt the results\nof the fastwind studies for reasons of consistency, but note that\nthe differences of both analyses are not signficant.\nIn Fig. 1 the distribution of the Galactic stars in the modified wind-momentum vs. luminosity diagram is presented,\nwhere black/grey symbols refer to fastwind/cmfgen analyses.\nDifferent luminosity classes are distinguished using circles, triangles and squares for, respectively, class V, III-II and I objects.\nThe open symbols show Dmom values resulting from scaling the\n\u1e40 by a factor of 0.44, corresponding to \u22120.37 in log Dmom , for\nsupergiants exhibiting H\u03b1 emission line profiles. A reduction\nof this amount was proposed by Repolust et al. (2004) to correct for the fact that these stars have a systematically higher\nwind momentum compared to O dwarfs and theoretical predictions (see also Puls et al. 2003; Markova et al. 2004). The\nphysical interpretation for this systematic offset proposed by\nthese authors is connected to wind clumping. Because H\u03b1 is a\nrecombination line, its strength scales with the (wind)density\n\u03c1 squared. In a uniformly clumped wind, the emission will increase by a factor f =< \u03c12 > / < \u03c1 >2 , where f is referred\nto as the clumping factor. As the H\u03b1 line-forming region of\nstars with H\u03b1 in emission is more extended compared to stars\nin which the profile is seen in absorption, these more extended\nregions must be more clumped than the innermost wind regions\nof those stars with absorption type profiles. In this interpretation, therefore, the observed offset suggests a (spatial) gradient\nin the clumping factor or a difference in the clumping properties of thin and thick winds. The (differential) clumping factor\nthat corresponds to the applied scaling is f = 1/0.442 ' 5. We\nwill return to the issue of clumping in Sect. 8.2.\nThe left-hand side of Fig. 1 compares the stars that have\nbeen analysed by Mokiem et al. (2005) in a homogeneous way\nby using an automated fitting method. We have constructed a\nWLR by fitting a power law, while accounting for both the symmetric errors in L? and the asymmetric errors in Dmom , to the\nobserved distribution. This empirical WLR is shown as a solid\nand dotted black line for uncorrected and clumping corrected\n\n\fM. R.

Modified wind-momentum \u2013 luminosity distribution of Galactic stars. Different luminosity classes are shown using circles,\ntriangles and squares for, respectively, V, III-II and I class objects. Upper limits are shown as inverted triangles. Black/grey\nsymbols refer to fastwind/cmfgen analyses. Clumping corrected Dmom values, using a clumping correction of \u22120.37 dex for\nobjects with a H\u03b1 emission line profile, are shown with open symbols. Left: stars analysed by Mokiem et al.

A dotted line is the WLR for clumping corrected values. Right: total Galactic sample.

The clumping corrected relation\nis found to be flatter because the clumping corrections only affected the two brightest objects. In Sect. 7 we will compare the\nempirical and theoretical WLRs in the observed L? range.\nOn the right-hand side of Fig. 1 the observed Dmom distribution for the complete Galactic sample is shown. The empirical WLRs determined for this sample are again shown as a\nblack solid and dotted line for the uncorrected and clumpingcorrected rates. As can be seen in Tab. 3 the fit coefficients for\n\nboth relations are in very good agreement with those derived\nfrom the homogeneously analysed sample.\nThe Galactic sample comprises results from both cmfgen\nand fastwind studies. We note that fastwind is so far limited to\nstudies of the visual spectral region \u2013 therefore H\u03b1 is the most\nimportant \u1e40 diagnostics \u2013 while cmfgen (also) uses the ultraviolet regime. In the latter approach the UV lines are given more\nweight in the mass-loss determination. In the case of weak\n\n\f8\n\nM. R.

For lower luminosities, the\nUV analyses of the dwarf sample studied by Martins et al.\n(2005) show a systematic discrepancy with the average relations. This is emphasised by the grey dashed line, which shows\nthe average relation for these objects. The fit coefficients of\nthis latter relation are also listed in Tab. 3 and clearly signal a\ndiscrepency between UV based mass-loss determinations and\ntheoretical expectations. This is referred to as the \"weak wind\nproblem\" (see e.g. Bouret et al. 2003). We will discuss this further in Sect. 8.1.\n\n6.2. LMC\nThe studies from which we have drawn the LMC sample are\nthose of Crowther et al. (2002), Massey et al. (2004, 2005),\nEvans et al. (2004a) and Mokiem et al. (2007). In Tab. A.2 the\nrelevant atmospheric parameters are listed. Note that some of\nthe objects in this table have been analysed in more than one\nstudy. In those cases we adopted the results from studies using\nthe automated fitting procedure developed by Mokiem et al.\n(2005). If these were not available we preferred results from\nstudies that used both the optical and UV spectral range over\nresults that consider only the optical regime. For a number of\nstars analysed by Mokiem et al. (2007), no UV measurement\nof the wind velocity was available. Consequently, these authors\nestimated v\u221e by scaling the escape velocity at the stellar surface\n(vesc ) with a constant factor of 2.6 (cf. Lamers et al. 1995). To\naccount for the metallicity dependence and to facilitate a comparison with theoretical predictions, we accordingly rescaled\nthis v\u221e using Eq. 3 with Z = 0.5 Z and n = 0.13 (cf. Leitherer\net al. 1992). In Tab. A.2 the rescaled values are given between\nbrackets. As v\u221e also influences the density in the line forming\nregion of wind sensitive lines (because of the requirement of\nmass continuity), also a rescaling of \u1e40 was required. For this\nwe used the wind-strength parameter\nQ=\n\n\u1e40\nR3/2\n? v\u221e\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nthat conserves the H\u03b1 equivalent width (Schmutz et al. 1989,\nsee also Puls et al. 1996 and de Koter et al. 1997). The combined effect of these re-scalings is a reduction of the modifiedwind momentum by 0.08 dex.\nThe distribution of the modified-wind momenta as a function of stellar luminosity for the LMC stars is shown in Fig. 2\nusing the same symbols as in Fig. 1. On the left-hand side\nof the figure we (again) only consider objects that have been\nanalysed by Mokiem et al. (2007) using an automated fitting\nmethod. The solid and dotted lines give the mean relations for\nuncorrected and clumping corrected rates. The correction applied was the same as for the Galactic stars. We note however\nthat the metallicity dependence of this correction is as yet unknown.\nFor the total sample, shown on the right-hand side of the\nFig. 2, the scatter is slightly larger. In particular the bright su-\n\npergiants Sk \u221267 22 at log L? /L \u2248 5.7 seems to stand out.\nProbably its discrepant position can be explained by the fact\nthat Massey et al. (2005) could only determine a lower limit\nfor its effective temperature, hence it could be intrinsically\nbrighter. Despite the increased scatter, the obtained WLRs are\nin good agreement with the relations determined from the homogeneously analysed sample. This can be seen from the fit\ncoefficients given in Tab. 3. For a confrontation of the empirical behaviour of the WLR with predictions, we refer the reader\nto Sect. 7.\n\n6.3. SMC\nIn Tab. A.3 atmospheric parameters are given for the SMC sample that was compiled from the studies of Hillier et al. (2003),\nBouret et al. (2003), Trundle et al. (2004), Massey et al. (2004),\nEvans et al. (2004a), Trundle & Lennon (2005), Massey et al.\n(2005) and Mokiem et al. (2006). For objects that were fitted\nin multiple studies we adopted results of one of these investigations following the same rules as applied to the LMC stars.\nWind velocities given between brackets correspond to values\nthat were calculated from the escape velocity at the stellar surface. These velocities and the associated mass-loss rates were\nscaled in a similar manner as was done for the LMC. Adopting\nZ = 0.2 Z , the Dmom values were scaled down by 0.18 dex.\nFigure 3 shows the distribution of the SMC stars in the\nDmom vs. L? diagram. The symbols used are the same as in\nFig. 1. On the left-hand side of the figure only the objects\nthat have been analysed using an automated fitting method by\nMokiem et al. (2006) are shown. For log L? /L . 5.3 the majority of the mass-loss determinations are upper limits. The empirical WLRs are shown using a solid and dotted line for uncorrected and clumping corrected wind momenta. Note the position of the dwarf NGC346-033 at log L? /L \u2248 5.0. We did\nnot include this object in the fits, as its high wind momentum is\nthe result of an anomalously high wind velocity resulting from\nthe scaling with vesc (also see Mokiem et al. 2006).\nThe right-hand side of Fig. 3 shows the wind momentum\ndistribution for the total SMC sample. For this large sample\nthe low luminosity part of the diagram still remains scarcely\npopulated. Also note the upper limits determined using cmfgen\nfor log L? /L < 5.2. This could point to a steeper WLR relation\nfor UV based mass-loss estimates compared to those obtained\nfrom H\u03b1, as was found for the galactic case. However, this is\nnot a firm statement as by far the bulk of the SMC targets in\nthis luminosity range only show upper limits.\nThe empirical WLRs for the total sample are shown on the\nright-hand side Fig. 3 as a black solid line for uncorrected wind\nmomenta and as a dotted line for clumping corrected values.\nWe find that these relations are strongly influenced by the objects with log L? /L < 5.3. This is shown by the grey solid and\ndashed lines, which correspond to the respective WLRs calculated ignoring these objects. As the low luminosity part of the\nSMC diagram is rather uncertain, we opted to use this latter set\nof relations. Note that this choice will not influence our determination of the metallicity dependence of \u1e40, as this will be\n\n\f30\n\n30\n\n29\n\n29\n\nlog Dmom\n\nlog Dmom\n\nM. R.

Mass loss versus metallicity\nNow that we have established the empirical modified-wind momentum luminosity relation for the three galaxies, we can determine the \u1e40(Z) relation. Before doing so, we first inter compare the results for these three environments, and confront them\nwith predictions.\n\n7.1. Global comparison\nIn Fig. 4 the empirical modified-wind momentum relations determined for the total observed samples (solid lines) are shown\nalongside the predicted relations of Vink et al.

To facilitate a meaningful\ncomparison one sigma confidence intervals for the observed\nWLRs are shown as grey areas.

Left and Right plots show, respectively, empirical WLRs including uncorrected and\nclumping corrected wind momentum rates. See Sect. 6.1 for the applied clumping correction. One sigma confidence intervals for\nthe empirical relations are shown as grey areas.\nother beyond the fitting uncertainties. We interpret this as quantitative evidence for a successive decrease of the mass-loss\nrates of massive stars in the Galactic, LMC, and SMC environment.\nFor the entire investigated luminosity range, the relative\nseparations of the empirical WLRs agree well with the separations predicted by Vink et al. (2001), although the empirical\nWLRs do show a systematic offset compared to the theoretical results. Focusing for a moment on the relative separations\nonly: measured at log L? /L = 5.75, which coincides with the\nregion where the fit uncertainties are the smallest, the offsets\nbetween the empirical and theoretical relations relative to the\nGalaxy are: 0.28 and 0.25 for the LMC, and 0.62 and 0.57 for\nthe SMC.\nThe systematic offset between observations and theory is\nof the order of 0.2 dex. This suggests that if wind clumping\ndoes affect the determination of empirical mass-loss rates, but\nwould only have a marginal effect on mass-loss predictions, the\nempirical mass-loss rates would be overestimated by at most a\nfactor of \u223c two.\n\n7.2. The empirical \u1e40(Z) relation\nTo calculate the mass loss metallicity dependence we use the\nrelative separation between the empirical modified-wind momentum relations at log L? /L = 5.75, for which the fit uncertainty in all three relations is at its minimum. Note that\nthe differential slopes also allow for a luminosity dependent\nZ-dependence, however, based on the uncertainties we doubt\nwhether this would be meaningful. Moreover, for the SMC it\nwas shown that this slope is very sensitive to the rather uncertain low luminosity domain. In Tab. 3 the power law indices\nfor the observed \u1e40(Z) dependence for the LMC and SMC relative to the Galaxy are listed. These were calculated using Eq. 4\nassuming n = 0.13. The indices determined from the homogeneously analysed sample are in good agreement with those\ndetermined for the total sample. For the LMC relatively larger\ndifferences are found compared to the SMC, which is a result\nof the smaller metallicity difference of this system relative to\nour galaxy. This also explains the larger error bars.\nTo determine the global metallicity dependence, we made\na linear fit regarding the logarithm of the differential (i.e. with\nrespect to the Galaxy) modified wind momentum and the log of\nthe differential metallicity. Assuming smooth winds, we find:\n\u1e40 \u221d Z 0.83\u00b10.16 .\n\nIndeed, when turning to the clumping corrected empirical\nrelations, the relative offset almost disappears. This is shown\non the right-hand side of Fig. 4, where we show the wind momentum relations obtained from the total observed samples accounting for this correction. Note that, strictly speaking, this\nagreement pertains only to stars not showing H\u03b1 in emission, as\nthe clumping corrections is designed such as to scale the ones\nthat do show H\u03b1 emission to those that do not (see Sect. 6.1).\nThe slopes of the empirical relations, however, are slightly flatter, as the clumping correction preferentially affects the highluminosity objects.\n\n(6)\n\nWe emphasize that the error bar in m is a fitting error of\nthe mass-loss rate and the metallicity only. Several uncertainties add to the quoted error. These include i) those related to\nthe adopted luminosity at which we gauge the relation; ii) errors related to the neglect of the correlation between luminosity\nand modified wind momentum (Markova et al. 2004, see); iii)\nerrors related to uncertainties in the v\u221e ( \u1e40) dependence, i.e. in\nthe adopted value n = 0.13, and iv) those related to possible\nsystematic uncertainties in the metallicities of the Magellanic\nClouds. The motivation for gauging at log L? /L = 5.75 is\ngiven above. Least squares fit analysis including the correla-\n\n\fM. R. Mokiem et al.: The emperical \u1e40(Z) dependence of O and early-B stars\n\ntion between L and D yield similar results for the stars analysed using the automated fitting method, though for the total\nsample the Galactic log D(log L) relation is found to be somewhat steeper. Deviations in the Galactic slope are to be expected (Markova et al. 2004). However, at log L? /L = 5.75\nthe wind momenta are not found to be very different and result\nin uncertainties \u2206m . 0.10 dex. Uncertainties in the velocity\nvs. metallicity dependence are not very well known, however,\nthey are likely to be small as well. By far the largest source of\nerror in m is that due to uncertainties in the metallicities of the\nMagellanic Clouds, notably that of the SMC. To illustrate this,\nif the SMC metal content is not \u2206[Z/H] \u223c \u22120.7 \u00b1 0.1 but rather\n\u22120.5\u00b10.1, the empirical value of m will increase to 1.13\u00b10.25.\nKeeping this in mind, the derived exponent m of the empirical mass-loss luminosity relation as given in Eq. 6 appears to be\nconsistent with the predicted value of mpred = 0.69 \u00b1 0.10 (Vink\net al. 2001) and mpred = 0.67 from the alternative investigation\nby Krti\u010dka (2006).\nIf we apply the earlier-mentioned clumping correction scaling of \u22120.37 dex in log Dmom for stars showing H\u03b1 emission,\nthe metallicity dependence is found to be:\n\u1e40 \u221d Z 0.72\u00b10.15 .\n\n(7)\n\nThis result too is consistent with both theoretical predictions quoted above.\nThree remarks need to be made. First, we can only state\nthat this \u1e40(Z) relation holds for stars more luminous than\n\u223c105.2 L . The reasons are the lack of firm \u1e40 determinations\nfor stars less luminous than this number and the inconsistency\nbetween the H\u03b1 and UV wind lines mass-loss diagnostics (see\nbelow). Note in particular that the slope of the WLR might depend on the wind-density and/or metallicity itself (as it is predicted from a close inspection of the line-strength distribution\nfunctions, cf. Puls et al. 2000), though not to such an extent as\nindicated by the weak wind problem (cf. Fig. 1). In so far, it\nis possible that the metallicity dependence for low-luminosity\nobjects deviates from our previous results.\nSecond, the absolute agreement in wind momentum only\nholds if the winds of the O dwarfs are not significantly\nclumped. If they are, the predictions (which do not yet account for clumping) may overestimate the mass-loss rate and\ntherefore Dmom . Third, if O dwarf winds are clumped, but the\nclumping does not depend on metal content or mass-loss (i.e.\nf , f (Z, \u1e40(Z))) then the derived m will not be affected, and,\ntherefore, the agreement in the observed and predicted mass\nloss \u2013 metallicity scaling will remain preserved. To rephrase\nthis last point: irrespective of what the actual \u1e40 values are, if\nclumping were independent of metallicity and wind density, the\nderived power-law index is anticipated to be correct \u2013 even if\nthe winds are significantly clumped.\nInterestingly, these analyses suggest that the systematic errors in the slope of the mass-loss-metallicity relation, m, as introduced by potential wind clumping may be less relevant than\nremaining uncertainties in the metallicity determinations of the\nMagellanic Clouds.\n\n11\n\n8. Discussion\n8.1. The weak wind problem\nAs mentioned before, for the majority of stars at lower luminosities the ultraviolet resonance lines based mass-loss rates\ndisagree strongly with theoretical predictions. Still, there are\nfew (though different) Galactic objects at similar, low luminosity which display a \"normal\" H\u03b1 mass-loss rate, which might\npoint either to different physics or questions the validity of at\nleast one of the applied diagnostical tools.\nGoing from high to low luminosity, figures 1 and 3 show\nthat this discrepancy appears at L? \u2248 105.25 L . The dwarf star\nsample recently analysed by Martins et al. (2005) using cmfgen suggests progressively weaker winds than are predicted by\ncurrent theory. At L \u223c 104.75 L this discrepancy has reached a\nfactor 100. Note that given the still limited number of stars investigated at relatively low luminosity alternative descriptions\n(compared to a steeper slope) of the WLR might also be appropriate. For instance, the WLR may retain the same slope\nbut jump to a two order of magnitudes lower value of Dmom\nat L . 105.25 L compared to the predictions. In the SMC, the\ndiscrepancy could be even worse, as UV analyses only yield\nupper limits. Note that also the H\u03b1 analyses of SMC objects\nat L . 105.25 L yield almost exclusively results as upper limits. So, in principle, these need not be contradictory to the UV\nbased \u1e40.\nWhat could be the reason for this \"weak wind problem\"?\nThere are three directions in which one might look for causes:\nfirst, errors in the H\u03b1 and/or UV analysis; second, missing\nphysics or invalid assumptions in the wind predictions, or,\nthird, the nature of the stars showing the weak wind problem\nis different from that of normal OB stars (that do appear to follow theory). Here, we focus on the first possibility. For more\nthorough discussions on this topic we refer to Martins et al.\n(2004, 2005) and de Koter (2006).\nTwo important advantages of the H\u03b1 method are that the\nionisation and abundance of hydrogen are well known. One\ncannot make this statement with similar confidence for the elements responsible for the UV resonance lines. For the weak\nwind stars, the prime \u1e40 diagnostic \u2013 C iv as mentioned \u2013 is only\na trace ion, i.e. it does not represent the dominant ionisation\nstage. This makes it is susceptible to X-ray emission, thought\nto originate from shocks that may develop in the wind outflow.\nMartins et al. (2005) present test calculations estimating that\nX-rays may decrease the C iv ionisation by an order of magnitude, requiring an increase of the mass loss by the same amount\nto preserve the line fit. With typical uncertainties in the carbon\nabundance of a factor of two, this shows that the UV method\nis much more prone to errors than the H\u03b1 method. This does\nnot imply that H\u03b1 does not suffer from uncertainties. Besides\nthe ambiguity in \u1e40 introduced by the unknown velocity law\nin weaker winds which has been discussed already, continuum\nrectification issues and potential nebular emission limit the applicability of the H\u03b1 diagnostic to stars with \u1e40 & 10\u22127 M yr\u22121 .\nTo reach this limit requires high signal-to-noise data of stars\nwith no appreciable nebular emission, such as is the case for\nthree of the five Galactic stars at L . 105.15 L \u2013 i.e. in the (UV\n\n\f12\n\nM. R. Mokiem et al.: The emperical \u1e40(Z) dependence of O and early-B stars\n\nidentified) weak wind regime. These galactic stars are \u03b6 Oph,\nCyg OB2 #2, and HD 217086. For two other stars at these low\nluminosities, \u03c4 Sco and 10 Lac, we also established the massloss rate, however, the error bars on these determinations are\nlarge. For the three stars mentioned, the H\u03b1 derived rates do\nappear to be more or less consistent with predictions. Note that\nsome of the C iv analyses account for (canonical) X-ray emission suggesting that the problem may not be fully explicable\nby uncertainties in the UV method.\nSo far the origin of the weak wind problem has not yet\nbeen identified. We stress that because of the poor overlap between the H\u03b1 and UV diagnostics, it is at present difficult to\nexclude the possibility that the (major) cause is simply connected with uncertainties in the wind structure predicted by the\nmodel atmospheres that are needed to derive the empirical \u1e40\u2013\nnotably the ionisation of species responsible for the UV resonance lines. Further spectroscopy in the IR, particularly using\nBr\u03b1 as an ideal mass-loss indicator also for weak winds, might\nunravel at least part of the problem.\n\n8.2. Small-scale clumping\nSo far, we have not discussed the physical reality of the \"clumping\" correction applied in Sect. 6 to bring the WLR relation\nof the supergiants with H\u03b1 emission line profiles in accord\nwith those of dwarfs. Is wind clumping observed in O stars?\nAnd, is clumping more important in the winds of supergiants?\nClumping was studied in detail by Hillier (1991) to explain the\nscattering wings of He ii lines of Wolf-Rayet stars. Although\nthese stars are known to have very dense winds, their He ii scattering wings are weak features. Consequently, for the weaker\nO star winds these diagnostics cannot be applied. Nonetheless,\ndirect observational evidence that the winds of O stars are also\nclumped was provided by Eversberg et al. (1998) from time\nseries spectroscopy of He ii \u03bb4686 in \u03b6 Pup, and by Crowther\net al. (2002); Hillier et al. (2003); Bouret et al. (2003); Massa\net al. (2003); Martins et al. (2004, 2005); Bouret et al. (2005),\nand Fullerton et al. (2006) from analysis of UV (resonance)\nlines, partly in combination with optical lines.\nThe fitting of the ultraviolet lines, notably\nP v \u03bb\u03bb1118, 1128, O v \u03bb1371, and N iv \u03bb1718, is found to\nbe improved if a distance dependent clumping is introduced\n\u2013 with clumps starting to form above the sonic point and\nreaching maximum clumping in the outer wind1 \u2013 and a void\ninterclump medium is assumed. In the above listed studies a\ntotal of 25 stars have been analysed using the cmfgen code.\nClumping corrections are applied in roughly half the sample,\nincluding both dwarfs and supergiants \u2013 for objects brighter\nthan 105.15 L . The maximum clumping factors that are derived\nfrom these studies are in the range 10 \u2013 100. Though clumping\ncorrections have turned out to be necessary for some stars\nbut not for others, this does not exclude the possibility that\nall stars are clumped to a certain degree: Due to the fact that\nonly few lines react differentially on clumping and thus allow\n1\nIn this respect \"outer\" implies the formation region of the UV\nresonance lines, which is inside of the region that contributes the bulk\nof the radio flux.\n\nfor distinct statements, it is rather difficult to exclude the\npresence of clumping in a certain object at the present state of\nknowledge unless the wavelength coverage is fairly complete\n(extending from the UV to the IR), and unless a large number\nof systematic investigations have been performed.\nIn addition to these purely spectroscopic investigations,\nPuls et al. (2006) analyzed a sample of Galactic O-type (super)giants more recently, combining H\u03b1, infrared, mm and radio fluxes to derive constraints on the radial stratification of the\nclumping factor. Since all diagnostics employed have a \u03c12 dependence, only relative clumping factors could be derived, normalized to the values in the outermost, radio-emitting region,\nwhereas absolute values for the clumping factors and thus the\nactual mass-loss rates remained unconstrained.\nIn contrast to present hydrodynamical simulations of the\nline-driving instability but in (partial) agreement with previous\nstudies it was found that for denser winds clumping starts fairly\nclose to the sonic point, reaches a certain maximum (mostly\nwithin r < 2R? ) and decreases outwards, where the maximum,\nnormalized clumping factors are of the order of 3 to 6. For\nweaker winds, on the other hand, the clumping factors in the\ninner and outermost regions turned out to be similar.\nThis appears to be consistent with findings from the linear\npolarimetry of Luminous Blue Variables (Davies et al. 2005),\nwhere it was found that (i) clumping must start close to the\nphotosphere to reproduce the observed levels of polarimetry,\nand (ii) denser winds yield a larger amount of linear polarisation (see also Robert et al. 1989, for WR stars).\nThe results by Puls et al. (2006) could mean one of two\nthings: either the outer wind is significantly clumped whilst the\ninner wind is even more strongly clumped (which would imply that the UV results calling for large clumping factors are\ncorrect), or the outer wind is not significantly clumped and the\ncurrent mass-loss predictions are approximately correct. The\nlatter possibility, of course, would require an explanation of the\ndifferent UV results.\n\n8.3. Concluding remarks\nThe first result we mention is that the empirical \u1e40(Z) relation\nappears to be in agreement with theoretical predictions for luminosities larger than \u223c105.2 L . Second, for lower luminosities, UV based \u1e40 determinations for dwarfs seem to indicate a\nbreakdown of the theory, leading to discrepancies of up to a factor 102 for the lowest luminosity stars with a measurable mass\nloss. We found that for the H\u03b1 based mass-loss rates of three\ngalactic stars, \u03b6 Oph, Cyg OB2 #2, and HD 217086, do follow\nthe predictions down to log L? /L \u2248 4.9. Their \u1e40 values are\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22127 M yr\u22121 or less, which is so low that they may suffer from uncertainties that are not reflected in the derived error\nbars, for instance those associated with the uncertain velocity\nlaw in low density winds and/or the unnoticed presence of minor amounts of nebular emission. Still, given these findings, it\nappears premature to exclude the possibility that the (major)\ncause of the breakdown between empirical and predicted mass\nloss at low luminosity is connected to modeling uncertainties\nassociated with the empirical \u1e40 values.\n\n\fM. R. Mokiem et al.: The emperical \u1e40(Z) dependence of O and early-B stars\n\nTo further probe the cause of the possible theoretical breakdown at low luminosity, it is therefore necessary to study those\nstars for which both the H\u03b1 and UV line indicators of mass\nloss can be applied \u2013 although unfortunately there is only a very\nlimited mass-loss regime for which this is possible. To this end,\nthe use of Br\u03b1 as a mass-loss diagnostic (Lenorzer et al. 2004;\nRepolust et al. 2005) will prove to be fruitful as it will widen\nthe overlap between hydrogen and UV line analyses. Regarding\nclumping, the P v resonance line seems a powerful diagnostic\n(Massa et al. 2003; Fullerton et al. 2006). Also, it may be fruitful to focus on the question whether all O-type stars suffer from\nclumping. Concerning the effect of clumping on the mass loss\nvs. metallicity relation, the following important remark can be\nmade: regardless what the actual \u1e40 values are, if clumping is\nuniversal in O-type stars, and if it does not depend on wind\nproperties such as density or metallicity, then the derived scaling (i.e. the power law index m) remains correct.\nFinally, let us briefly contemplate some implications of Otype star mass-loss rates that are lower by factors of 3 to 100\nthan so far assumed. These implications branch out into at least\ntwo directions: wind hydrodynamics and stellar evolution. For\nour understanding of the intrinsic instabilities associated with\nthe wind driving mechanism (Owocki 1994) the requirement\nof clumping factors f \u223c 10 \u2212 100 in the H\u03b1 line forming regions of dwarf O-type stars, which do not extend far beyond the\nsonic point, seems to imply that these density inhomogeneities\nhave developed already in the sub-sonic part of the flow. As an\nexample, the O5 V star N11-051 in the LMC has an H\u03b1 line\nforming region that extends from the photosphere to a velocity\nof 13 km s\u22121 , which is about 0.6 times the sonic velocity. For\nother O-type dwarfs, similar results are found. This is not anticipated by theory, which predicts that the onset of line-driven\ninstabilities is only at about the sonic velocity (where, admittedly, the growth rate of the instability is large). Implications\nfor the wind driving mechanism may also be severe, although\nit should be noted that clumping has not yet been incorporated\nin mass-loss predictions.\nClumping may also impact on our understanding of massive star evolution. Weaker stellar winds will cause less loss of\nangular momentum. Consequently the stars will not spin down\nas rapidly as currently thought. It may even be expected that\nmost Galactic massive stars retain their initial rotational velocity properties during the entire main sequence (Meynet &\nMaeder 2000; Maeder & Meynet 2001). For the brightest stars\n\u2013 corresponding to initial masses of 60 M or more \u2013 the integrated main-sequence mass loss could drop dramatically. With\nthe current rates they are expected to lose 20 to 40 percent of\ntheir mass in the H-burning phase. This could drop by a factor\nof three, requiring the objects to lose ten to tens of solar masses\nby other means in order to evolve towards the hot Wolf-Rayet\nphase (Smith & Owocki 2006). This could either imply an increase of the duration of the LBV phase by a factor of two,\nassuming that the (unknown) mechanism thought to be responsible for the eruptive mass loss in this phase is unaffected by\nclumping issues (see e.g. Humphreys & Davidson 1994), or alternatively that some LBVs explode before reaching the WolfRayet phase (Kotak & Vink 2006; Gal-Yam et al. 2007; Smith\n2007).\n\n13\n\nAcknowledgements.
