Recently, transformation optics inspired from the advent of metamaterials offers\ngreat versatility for manipulating wave propagation at will to create amazing illusion\neffects. In the present work, we proposed a novel transformation recipe, in which the\ncloaking shell somehow behaves like a \"cloaking lens\", to provide almost all desired\nfeatures one can expect for a real magic cloak. The most exciting feature of the\ncurrent recipe is that an object with arbitrary characteristics (e.g., size, shape or\nmaterial properties) can be invisibilized perfectly with positive-index materials, which\nsignificantly benefits the practical realization of a broad-band cloaking device\n\n1\n\n\ffabricated with existing materials. Moreover, the one concealed in the hidden region\nis able to undistortedly communicate with the surrounding world, while the lens-like\ncloaking shell will protect the cloaked source/sensor from being traced back by\noutside detectors by creating a virtual image.\n\nA continuously changing refractive index results in changes of light propagation\nto create illusion effect. The most common example is the curved glass lens that can\nredirect the electromagnetic field by either bending or focusing the light beam.\nWith conventional homogeneous materials, optical design is mainly a matter of\ndetermining the interface between two materials. The advent of artificial complex\nmetamaterials enables novel wave manipulations that are impossible to achieve with\nthe nature materials (1, 2, 3). Transformation optics, introduced with the great\nprogress of metamaterial implementation, establishes a correspondence between\ncoordinate transformations and material constitutive properties and inspires\nresearchers to take a fresh look at the conventional foundations of optics (1).\nAnalogous to general relativity, the principle of transformation optics shows that the\nfield of wave (light, acoustic waves, and matter wave, etc.) can also be controlled in\nan arbitrary manner, with specially designed structures (4). The ability of designing\nand engineering the wave field offers researchers great versatility to manipulate wave\npropagation at will, and then create amazing illusion effects in which the\ninvisibility-cloaking is perhaps the most popular and intriguing topic (5, 6, 7).\nSo far, a wide variety of approaches have been proposed for cloaking purpose.\n\n2\n\n\f\"Push-forward mapping\" (5, 8, 9), one of the most common strategies, was\ndeveloped to exclude the wave from the inner domain without perturbing the exterior\nfields by expanding a point into a hole where the cloaked object would be hidden.\nHowever, owing to the existence of singularity in the coordinate transformation,\ninfinite parameters would be required for the cloaking materials, which limited the\napplication of this approach in a narrow bandwidth. Moreover, the object concealed\nwith this method can not \"see\" the outside world, which leads to the problem of\n\"double-blind\". By sacrificing some degree of cloaking effects, other approaches (6,\n10, 11) were then developed to achieve wider operating bandwidth using the\nmaterials with less extreme parameters, whereas the modified recipes offered little\nhelp to the double-blind problem. Therefore, another approach, so-called \"external\ncloaking\" (12, 13, 14), was proposed to overcome this problem, in which the cloaked\nobject could be \"canceled out\" by its \"anti-object\" and be able to share information\nwith the surrounding. However, the external cloak can only work in a steady state,\nsince the multiple-scattering between the cloaked object and anti-object has to reach\nequilibrium to achieve the destructive interference of scattered waves. Particularly, in\norder to serve as an anti-object to the cloaked one, the cloaking material must be\n\"custom-made\" with double-negative parameters, which creates an obstacle for the\npractical realization of the external cloaking. Furthermore, although the cloaked\nobject is not \"blinded\", one can only catch anamorphic images for the outside world,\nsince the penetrating waveform could be distorted inside the cloaked region. Recently,\nZhu et al. (15) proposed another transformation model, named as \"magnifying\n\n3\n\n\fsuperlens\", to fulfill the task of \"non-double-blinded\" cloaking using complementary\nmaterials designed with single-negative parameters, which are not dependent on the\nproperties of the host material and cloaked object. Although the application of\nsingle-negative complementary materials will reduce the fabrication difficulties, the\nbroad-band cloaking still can hardly be achieved because the operating frequencies of\ncomplementary media must overlap each other. In addition, this method can only be\napplied to the cloaked object that is more compressible than the host medium, since\nthe cloaked object should be mapped to a bulk of host medium with relatively larger\nsize.\nDespite of the fact that various transformation models have been developed, the\nreal \"Harry Potter's cloak\" is still out of reach. In the present work, a novel\ntransformation model is proposed to unprecedentedly approach the dream cloak. This\nmethod moves from a \"superlens\" to a \"cloaking lens\", without referring to the\ncomplementary concept. The invisibility cloak designed with current transformation\nmodel would allow one to see the outside world un-anamorphically, while perfectly\nconcealing his/her presence. This model should be fit for cloaking objects with\narbitrary characteristics (e.g., size, shape or material properties) under all\ncircumstances. Most important of all, the current scheme allows designing the\ncloaking shell with only positive-index materials, which dramatically relaxes the\nextreme property requirements for the cloak material and offers the designer great\npossibility to experimentally realize the cloaking structure with existing materials\nwithin a broad frequency band.\n\n4\n\n\fThe principle of current transformation model is general and equally applicable\nto various wave forms (e.g., acoustic waves, electromagnetic waves, matter waves), as\nlong as the wave equations can keep invariant under coordinate transformations. For\nan arbitrary wave form, the scalar Helmholtz equation with a source term can be\nwritten as (16)\n\n1 n \uf0b6\n\uf0e5\n| g | i , j \uf03d1 \uf0b6xi\n\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f6 2\nij \uf0b6p\n\uf0e7\uf0e7 | g | g\n\uf0f7\uf0f7 \uf02b k p \uf03d f ,\n\uf0b6\nx\nj\n\uf0e8\n\uf0f8\n\n(1)\n\nfor a Riemannian metric g \uf03d ( gij ) in n -dimensional space, where | g |\uf03d det( gij ) ,\n( g ij ) \uf03d g \uf02d1 \uf03d ( gij ) \uf02d1 . Here, we only consider the simplest nontrivial 2D situation in\n\nacoustics, where \uf077 \uf03d k , \u03c1\uf02d1 \uf03d ( \uf072 0\uf02d1\uf064 ij )( | g | g ij ) , \u03ba \uf03d (\uf06b 0\uf064 ij )( | g |) \uf02d1 with \uf072 0 \uf02d1\uf064 ij\nand \uf06b 0\uf064 ij being the inverse mass density tensor and bulk modulus tensor in the\nvirtual space. For the mapping between orthogonal coordinates in virtual space x\nand real space x\uf0a2 , the corresponding metric tensor is\n\uf0ec \uf0e9 h \uf0b6x \uf0f9 2 \uf0e9 h \uf0b6x \uf0f9 2 \uf0fc\n\uf0ef x\n\uf0ef\nx\ng \uf03d diag \uf0ed \uf0ea 1 1 \uf0fa , \uf0ea 2 2 \uf0fa \uf0fd ,\n\uf0ef\uf0ee \uf0eb\uf0ea hx1\uf0a2 \uf0b6x1\uf0a2 \uf0fb\uf0fa \uf0ea\uf0eb hx2\uf0a2 \uf0b6x2\uf0a2 \uf0fb\uf0fa \uf0ef\uf0fe\n\n(2)\n\nwhere hx1 , hx2 and hx1\uf0a2 , hx2\uf0a2 are the scale factors in the orthogonal coordinates. As\nillustrated in Fig. 1, an equivalence is established in the 2D cylindrical coordinates\nbetween a bulk of host medium A (0 \uf03c r \uf03c a1 ) and the cloaked object A\uf0a2\n\n(0 \uf03c r \uf0a2 \uf03c a2 ) , so does an annulus of host medium B (a1 \uf03c r \uf03c b) and the cloak shell\nB\uf0a2 (a2 \uf03c r \uf0a2 \uf03c b) . Here r (or r \uf0a2 ) refers to the radius of studied region. The effective\nmass density \uf0721 of the cloaked object should be assumed to be the same as the mass\ndensity \uf0720 of the host medium, which then has practical significance for cloaking\nthe object buoyant in fluid. For simplicity we choose the circle configuration for the\n5\n\n\fcloaked object. The mapping relationship between virtual space x and real space\nx \uf0a2 can be written as\n\n\uf0ecr (a2 / a1 ), 0 \uf03c r \uf03c a1\n\uf0ef\nr \uf0a2 \uf03d f (r ) \uf03d \uf0ed(rbn\uf02d1 )1 n , a1 \uf03c r \uf03c b ,\n\uf0efr ,\nr \uf03eb\n\uf0ee\n\n\uf04a\uf0a2 \uf03d \uf04a ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the mapping order n \uf0ce (0,1) \uf055 (1, \uf0a5) , and b \uf03d (a2n / a1 )1/( n\uf02d1) . Suppose the mass\ndensity tensor and the bulk modulus tensor of the cloaked object are \u03c1ob \uf03d \uf0720\uf064 ij and\n\u03baob \uf03d \uf06b1\uf064 ij , respectively. According to Eqs. (1)-(3), for particular a2 (the radius of\n\nthe cloaked object) and n (the mapping order), the mass density tensor \u03c1S , the bulk\nmodulus tensor \u03baS , and the external radius of the cloaking shell b can be readily\ndetermined as:\n\u03c1S \uf03d \uf072 0 (n\uf064 i1 \uf02b n \uf02d1\uf064 i 2 )\uf064 ij , \u03baS \uf03d (a2 / r \uf0a2) 2 n \uf02d 2 \uf06b1 / (n\uf06b 0 )\uf064 ij , b \uf03d a2 (\uf06b1 / \uf06b 0 )1/(2 n \uf02d 2) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \uf064 ij is Kronecker delta and r \uf0a2 \uf0ce (a2 , b) . It can be apparently observed that only\npositive parameters are required for the cloaking materials, which is quite desirable\nfor overcoming the hurdle in the practical implementation of cloaking device in a\nbroad bandwidth. Normally, the cloaking material parameters designed using\npreviously proposed transformation strategies are unique to the properties of cloaked\nobjects and the host medium (12, 13, 14), which will significantly limit the\nexperimental implementation of the invisibility-cloaking. The present transformation\nstructure offers high flexibility for engineering the cloaking materials by adjusting the\nstructural parameters of the shell. The strict demand on the cloaking shell properties\ncould be reduced by increasing the shell thickness. According to Eq. (4), when the\nmapping order n goes lower (viz. thicker cloaking shell), the material of the shell\n\n6\n\n\ftends to be less anisotropic and inhomogeneous, which provides higher degrees of\nfreedom for designing the cloaking shell.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, it is apparent that b \uf03e a2 . Since b = (a2n / a1 )1/( n\uf02d1) =\n\na2 (\uf06b1 / \uf06b 0 )1/(2 n\uf02d2) , two cases should be considered individually for a1 \uf03e a2 , \uf06b1 \uf03c \uf06b 0 as\n\nn \uf0ce (0,1) and a1 \uf03c a2 , \uf06b1 \uf03e \uf06b 0 as n\uf0ce (1, \uf0a5) . Our transformation scheme is\ndemonstrated in the Fig. 2. We first consider the case that the cloaked object is\nequivalent to a larger bulk of host medium, i.e. a1 \uf03e a2 for n \uf03d (0,1) . As mentioned\nabove, it is obvious that the bulk modulus of the cloaked object is smaller than that of\nthe host medium, which means the cloaked object is more compressible than the host\nmedium. The coordinates of physical space (Fig. 2B) are curved transformations of\nCartesian coordinates in a virtual space (Fig. 2A), in which the waves propagate along\nstraight lines. The corresponding full-wave simulations for the cloaking effects of the\ndesigned devices are illustrated in the Supporting Online Materials (17). As shown in\nFig. 2B, after applying current transformation, the cloaking shell serves as a special\nlens to bend the incident waves, then guides them to flow around the cloaked object\ninside the cloaking shell (e.g., yellow lines) or straightly penetrate the hidden region\n(e.g., blue lines), finally returns them to their original paths on the far side, which\nmakes the outside observers be unaware of the contents in the hidden region. In Fig.\n2B, it is notable that the penetrated waves inside the cloaked region are also following\nstraight paths. This feature not only allows the transformation devise to solve the\ndouble-blinded problem as the external cloaking does, but also ensures the cloaked\none to undistortedly share the information with outside world, which might offer a\n\n7\n\n\fbetter strategy to design a genuine \"Harry Potter's cloak\". There is a special case in\nthis category: the thickness of the cloaking shell has a minimum (viz. b \uf03d a1 ). Under\nthis condition, the shell is mapped to a circle line after the transformation, which leads\nto the concept of superlens cloaking given by Zhu et al. (15)\nThen we consider the case that the bulk modulus of the cloaked object is larger\nthan that of the host medium, i.e., the cloaked object is less compressible than the host\nmedium. With the current transformation scheme, the cloaked object is equivalent to a\nsmaller bulk of host media, i.e.\n\na1 \uf03c a2\n\nfor\n\nn \uf03d (1, \uf0a5) . The one-to-one\n\ncorrespondences between the virtual and physical spaces for this case are illustrated in\nFigs. 2C and 2D, respectively. It is obvious that, similar to the case demonstrated in\nFigs. 2A and 2B, the cloaking structure designed with current transformation scheme\ncan conceal the object perfectly and enable undistorted information exchange between\nthe cloaked objects and the surrounding environment, although the wave rays\npropagating inside the cloaking shell would be bent apart from the hidden region due\nto the material compressibility difference. There also exists a special case in this\ncategory: when the cloaked object is extremely incompressible (nearly a rigid body),\nit can be mapped to a point-like host medium after the transformation (a1 \uf0ae 0) . This\nkind of rigid body can be well hidden using the proposed transformation strategy and\nthe cloaking material parameters designed are consistent with those given by Pendry\net al. (5)\nGoing far beyond \"non-double-blinded\" cloaking, current transformation\nstructure also owes another promising feature, which allows the one inside the\n\n8\n\n\fcloaked region to transmit useful information out without being traced back. Imagine\nwe put a source (O) in the cloaked region (see Fig. 3). Now the cloaking shell also\nbehaves like a lens. Before entering the outside space, the wave rays sent from the\nsource will be refracted twice on the internal (red circle) and external (dark cyan\ncircle) interfaces of the shell. Due to the \"lens refraction\", a virtual image (O*), whose\nsize and position are different from the real image (O), is created in the hidden region,\nso that the real source can be protected from being detected by outside observers.\nThe current transformation structure, which could be regarded as building a\nbridge between the conventional lens and the transformation optics, realizes the\npurpose of \"seeing without being seen\" and unprecedentedly gets closer to the magic\nHarry Potter's cloak. The designed cloaking shell parameters are not strictly subjected\nto the characteristics of the concealed object, neither are suffering from the demand of\nextreme properties (e.g., singularity or negative-index). The ability of designing the\ncloaking shell with positive parameters will offer great freedom for the practical\nfabrication and implementation of invisibility-cloaking within a broadband spectrum.\nFurthermore, this recipe enables the source inside the hidden region to freely transmit\nsignals out without exposing its actual information (e.g., size and position).\nReferences and Notes\n\n1.

The schematic illustration of current transformation strategy. The device\nperforms a coordinate transformation from the virtual space (left) to physical space\n(right). The virtual space is empty and flat. In the physical space, an object is\nconcealed in the cloaked region without being \"blinded\". The mapping approach is\nstraightforward, where A \uf0ae A\uf0a2 , B \uf0ae B\uf0a2 , and C \uf0ae C\uf0a2 . A\uf0a2 is filled with the\ncloaked object\n\n(0 \uf03c r \uf0a2 \uf03c a2 )\n\nand\n\nB\uf0a2\n\nis filled with the cloaking material\n\n( a2 \uf03c r \uf0a2 \uf03c b ).\n\n11\n\n\fFig. 2. Coordinate transformations of the \"non-blinded\" cloaking device in two cases,\nin which the cloaked object is either more compressible (A and B) or less\ncompressible (C and D) than the host medium. In the virtual space (A and C), the\ndevice creates the illusion that waves (yellow and blue lines) propagate through a\nspace that is empty and flat. The virtual plane carries the coordinate grid that is\nmapped onto the physical space, where the incident wave beams are bent\nconvergently (B) or divergently (D) by the cloaking shell. The waves seem to pass\nthrough an empty area if observed in the far field. The yellow lines are steered around\nthe cloaked object within the cloaking shell, while the blue lines penetrate through the\ncloaked object without phase distortion.\n12\n\n\fFig. 3. The invisible transmitter. A transmitter inside the hidden region can freely\ninterrogate the outside world. The cloaking shell, acting like a lens, can protect the\nsignal source (O) against outside detection by creating a virtual image (O*). A: The\nvirtual image looks larger than the original one, when the cloaked object is more\ncompressible than the host medium. B: The virtual image looks smaller than the\noriginal source, when the cloaked object is less compressible than the host medium.\n\n13\n\n\fSupporting Online Materials\n1. Full-wave simulations for acoustic wave\n\nFull-wave simulations were performed using finite element method (FEM) to\ndemonstrate the cloaking properties of the designed structure. The following figures\nillustrate the simulation results for the cases of a1 \uf03e a2 , \uf06b1 \uf03c \uf06b 0 as n \uf0ce (0,1) and\n\na1 \uf03c a2 , \uf06b1 \uf03e \uf06b 0 as n\uf0ce (1, \uf0a5) , respectively.\nWe first investigate the case of a scatterer illuminated by plane wave (SFig. 1).\nHere, the wavelength of the incident wave is assumed to be \uf06c \uf03d 0.5 m. The host\nmedium is set to be water with the bulk modulus and the mass density to be\n\n\uf06b 0 \uf03d 2.19 GPa and \uf0720 \uf03d 998 kg/m3, respectively. The pressure field distributions\nfor the scatterer more (less) compressible than the host medium are illustrated in\nSFigs.1 A and B (SFigs.1 C and D). As shown in SFigs. A and C, the plane waves are\nstrongly disturbed by the bare scatterers, which results in the backward reflection and\nsharp-edged shadow. SFigures B and D show the cloaking effect, where the\nlow-reflection and shadow-reducing properties are clearly demonstrated. The plane\nwave field is undisturbed outside the cloaking shell. More important, the plane wave\ncan penetrate through the cloaked object without changing the shape of wavefront,\nwhich makes it capable to undistortedly receive information from the outside.\nAnother notable point is that the resonance phenomenon, which is claimed to be the\nparticular characteristic effect occurring on the interface between the complementary\nmedia with negative parameters, is successfully suppressed by the use of the\npositive-index materials.\n\n14\n\n\fSFig. 1. The pressure field distribution for acoustic wave incident from a plane source.\nIn A and B, the scattering object which is more compressible than the host medium is\nilluminated without/with a cloak. The bulk modulus, the mass density, and the radius\nof the cloaked object are \uf06b ob \uf03d 0.49\uf06b 0 , \uf072ob \uf03d \uf0720 , and a2 = 0.64 m, respectively. The\nouter radius of the cloak is readily determined as b \uf03d 1 m for the mapping order\n\nn \uf03d 0.2 . In C and D, an object which is less compressible than the host medium is\nilluminated without/with a cloak. The bulk modulus, the mass density and the radius of\nthe cloaked object are \uf06b ob \uf03d 4\uf06b 0 , \uf072ob \uf03d \uf0720 , and a2 \uf03d 1 m, respectively. The outer\nradius of the cloak is readily determined as b \uf03d 2 m for n \uf03d 3 . In all cases, the\nacoustic wavelength in the host medium is \uf06c \uf03d 0.5 m.\n\nThe full-wave simulations were also performed for the case of a point source (S)\ninside the cloaked region. SFigures 2 A and B (C and D) illustrated the pressure field\ndistributions for the cloaked medium is more (less) compressible than the host one.\n15\n\n\fAccording to the comparison between SFigs. 2 A(C) and B(D), the utilization of\nspecially designed cloak shell can eliminate the wave field disturbance caused by the\npresence of the scatterer. This feature enables the highest flexibility and stability for\nthe source to communicate with outside world. On the other hand, it is impossible for\nthe outside observer to trace back the original position of the source, since the\nwavefront inside the cloaked region is bent with the \"cloaking lens\" shell.\n\nSFig. 2. The pressure field distribution for acoustic wave sending from a point source\ninside the cloaked region, without (A and C) or with (B and D) the cloaking shell. In\nA and B, the cloaked object is more compressible than the host medium and the point\n\nsource S located at ( \uf02d 0.64 m ,0) . In C and D, the cloaked object is less\n\ncompressible than the host medium, and S \uf0a2 located at ( \uf02d 1 m , 0) . In all cases, the\nacoustic wavelength in the host medium is \uf06c \uf03d 0.5 m.\n\n16\n\n\f2. Full-wave simulations for electromagnetic wave\n\nIt has been mentioned in the main body of the manuscript that the current\ntransformation scheme can be equally applied to various wave forms (e.g., acoustic\nwaves, electromagnetic waves, matter waves). Here, the full-wave simulations were\nalso carried out for the scatterers illuminated with electromagnetic plane waves. The\ncomparison between SFigs. 3 A (C) and B (D) shows the cloaking effect for the object\nwhose permittivity is larger (smaller) than that of the host medium. It is obvious that\nthe pressure field will be disturbed due to the presence of a bare scatterer (SFigs. 3 A\nand C). Bent with the \"cloaking lens\" shell (see SFigs. 3 B and D), the distorted waves\ncan be guided back to their original paths. Therefore, in the eyes of observers, the\nincident waves seem to pass through an empty area and the scatterer is concealed\nperfectly. It notable that the incident waves can straightly penetrate the cloaked region,\nwhich enables the one inside the hidden region to communicate with surrounds\nundistortedly.\n\n17\n\n\fSFig. 3. Normalized electric field distribution for TE wave incident from a plane\nsource. A bare scatterer is shielded by nothing [A, C] or a cloak [B, D]. For A and B,\nthe material parameters of host medium and cloaked object are \uf065 h \uf03d 1 , \uf06dh \uf03d 1 and\n\n\uf065 o \uf03d 2 , \uf06do \uf03d 1 , respectively. For C and D, the material parameters of host matrix and\ncloaked object are \uf065 h \uf03d 2 , \uf06dh \uf03d 1 and \uf065 o \uf03d 1 , \uf06do \uf03d 1 , respectively. In B, the\nstructural parameters are a2 \uf03d 1 , b \uf03d 1.5422 , and the mapping order is n \uf03d 0.2 ; in D,\nthe corresponding parameters are: a2 \uf03d 1 , b \uf03d 1.1225 , and n \uf03d 2 . In all cases, the\nwavelength in the host medium is \uf06c \uf03d 0.3 unit .\n\n18\n\n\f"}
