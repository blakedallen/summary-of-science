We assume also asymptotical flatness. Two popular approaches\nto the constructions of black hole initial data will be adopted. The first is\nthe Bowen-York solution [1] based on the conformal transverse-traceless decomposition [3] of Einstein equations with certain additional assumptions such as\nconformal flatness and maximal slicing. The second is the puncture approach\n[2] developed by Brandt and Br\u00fcgmann. Their idea was to remove analytically\nthe coordinate singularity at the location of the black hole. In this way they\navoided inner boundary conditions present in the Bowen-York approach. We\nfollow these ideas as close as possible but some important modifications are\nnecessary. Garat and Price [5] have proved nonexistence of conformally flat\nslices of the Kerr spacetime. Thus the assumption of conformal flatness must\nbe abandoned. We assume maximal slicing in order to simplify the problem\nbut in general it is not necessary. Our approach is straightforward. We use\nthe quasi-isotropic radial coordinate [3], [4] in which it is easy to show that the\nKerr solution is composed of two isometric regions smoothly joined at a sphere\nof some radius. Then the original Bowen-York inner boundary conditions can be\napplied. The momentum constraints in the axially symmetric case can be solved\n1\n\n\fanalytically for the flat background metric [25], [20], and they can be solved numerically in the case of metrics which are not conformally flat. We solve the\nhamiltonian constraint using the finite element method (FEM) [8] techniques,\nthen we find the apparent horizon and test the Penrose inequality.\nOur paper consists of three parts. In the first we shortly review Einstein\nconstraint equations. The second section discusses the numerical approach and\nspecial assumptions that are made there. The third part deals with detailed\nresults.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nEinstein Constraint Equations\nADM framework\n\nIn the Cauchy formulation of Einstein equations [9],[3] the whole 4-dimensional\nmanifold is foliated into a set of the so-called slices. These slices are the 3dimensional, spacelike surfaces labeled by a parameter t (time). The Einstein\nequations are projected onto these hypersurfaces. One obtains six evolution\nequations and four constraint equations that the metric, \u03b3ij , and the extrinsic\ncurvature, Kij , of each slice must satisfy. In the ADM (3+1) decomposition of\nthe spacetime the metric can be written as\nds2 = \u2212N 2 dt2 + \u03b3ij (dxi + \u03b2 i dt)(dxj + \u03b2 j dt).\n\n(1)\n\nThe proper time between slices is given by the lapse function N and the coordinate drift between slices is described by the shift vector \u03b2 i . The evolution\nequations in a vacuum have the following form\n(\u2202t \u2212 L\u03b2 )\u03b3ij\n(\u2202t \u2212 L\u03b2 )Kij\n\n= \u22122N Kij ,\n= (\u2212\u2207i \u2207j + Rij + KKij \u2212 2Kik Kjk )N.\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nHere Rij is the Ricci tensor on the slice, K is the trace of the extrinsic curvature\nand the covariant derivative \u2207i is taken with respect to the spatial metric \u03b3ij .\nL\u03b2 denotes the Lie derivative along the shift vector \u03b2 i .\nThe minimal set of initial data consisting of the 3-dimensional metric \u03b3ij\nand the extrinsic curvature Kij cannot be specified independently on the initial\nslice. These data are constrained by four equations, as mentioned above, because\nthe slices must fit properly into the 4-dimensional manifold. The first of these\nequations is known as the hamiltonian (or scalar) constraint\nR + K 2 \u2212 Kij K ij = 0,\n\n(4)\n\nand the other three, called momentum (or vector) constraints read as\n\u2207j (K ij \u2212 \u03b3 ij Kll ) = 0.\n\n(5)\n\nHere R denotes the Ricci scalar. Let us note that if the above constraint equations are satisfied on one initial hypersurface, the same holds true on each slice.\nIt is also important that the constraint equations do not depend on the lapse\nfunction N and the shift vector \u03b2 i which can be freely chosen on each slice.\nThis is the base of the (general) gauge invariance of the theory.\n2\n\n\f2.2\n\nYork-Lichnerowicz conformal approach\n\nThe process of solving of the constraint equations can be significantly simplified\nby the conformal York-Lichnerowicz decomposition [3], [1]:\n\u03b3ij\nKij\n\n\u03c8 4 \u03b3\u0302ij ,\n\n=\n=\n\nK\u0302ij \u03c8\n\n\u22122\n\n(6)\n.\n\n(7)\n\nThe new metric \u03b3\u0302ij is called the conformal (or background) metric and can\nbe chosen arbitrarily. This conformal tranformation preserves the shape of the\nmomentum constraints:\n\u02c6 j (K\u0302 ij \u2212 \u03b3\u0302 ij K\u0302ll ) = 0,\n\u2207\n\n(8)\n\nand the hamiltonian constraint can be rewritten as\n\u02c6 2 \u03c8 = 1 R\u0302\u03c8 \u2212 1 (K\u0302ij K\u0302 ij \u2212 (K\u0302 i )2 )\u03c8 \u22127 .\n\u2207\ni\n8\n8\n\n(9)\n\n\u02c6 and the Ricci scalar R\u0302 correspond to the background\nThe covariant derivative \u2207\nmetric \u03b3\u0302ij . We will also impose the maximal slicing condition\nK = Kii = 0.\n\n(10)\n\nThis equality can be understood as a gauge fixing condition. It fixes the lapse\nfunction N and is convenient in avoiding coordinate singularities during the\ntime evolution of the system. It also simplifies the constraint equations which\nfinally take the form\n\n2.3\n\n\u02c6 j K\u0302 ij = 0,\n\u2207\n\n(11)\n\n\u02c6 2 \u03c8 = 1 R\u0302\u03c8 \u2212 1 K\u02c6ij K\u0302 ij \u03c8 \u22127 .\n\u2207\n8\n8\n\n(12)\n\nAxially symmetric ansatz\n\nWe would like to solve numerically the constraint equations for the boosted Kerr\nblack hole with momentum directed along angular momentum. Therefore it is\ndesirable to choose a Weyl metric as the background metric. The Weyl metric\nis axially symmetric and its line element in the spherical coordinates has the\nform [10], [11]\n\u03b3\u0302ij dxi dxj = exp(\u2212q(r, \u03b8))(dr2 + r2 d\u03b82 ) + r2 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 .\n\n3\n\n(13)\n\n\fLet us recall that the Kerr initial data can be written (in terms of quasi-isotropic\nradial coordinate r) as [3]\nexp(\u2212q(r, \u03b8))\n\n=\n\n\u03a3\n\n=\n\n(R2\n\n=\n\nb\n\n=\n\n(14)\n\nR2 + a2 cos2 \u03b8,\n2\n\n\u2206 =\nR\n\n+\n\n\u03a32\n,\n\u2212 \u2206a2 sin2 \u03b8\n\na2 )2\n\n(15)\n\n2\n\nR \u2212 2mR + a ,\nb2\nr+m+ ,\nr\n\u221a\nm2 \u2212 a 2\n,\n2\n\n(16)\n(17)\n(18)\n\nwhere m, a are Kerr parameters and the conformal factor \u03c8(t, \u03b8) is given by\n\u03c8 4 (r, \u03b8) =\n\n\u03a3\nexp(q(r, \u03b8)).\nr2\n\n(19)\n\nWe will fix the exp(\u2212q(r, \u03b8)) factor in (13) to be that from the Kerr metric (14).\nThe external curvature in the axially symmetric case with maximal slicing can\nbe written in the form\n\uf8eb f11 (r,\u03b8) f12 (r,\u03b8) sin \u03b8\n\uf8f6\nf13 (r,\u03b8)\n\uf8ec\n(K\u0302ij ) = \uf8ed\n\nr2\n\nr\n\n...\n...\n\nf22 (r, \u03b8)\n...\n\nr2\nf23 (r,\u03b8))\nsin \u03b8\n2\n22 (r,\u03b8)) sin \u03b8\n\u2212 (f11 (r,\u03b8)+f\nexp(\u2212q(r,\u03b8))\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere i, j = r, \u03b8, \u03c6 and K\u0302ij = K\u0302ji .

This is the case when\nthe angular momentum of the Kerr black hole is equal to zero and we get the\nSchwarzschild solution. Thus for a = 0 we have the flat background metric and\nthen the momentum constraints can be solved analytically (assuming maximal\nslicing and axial symmetry).

The component K\u0302\u03c6\u03c6 can\nbe calculated from the maximal slicing condition K\u0302ii = 0. These formulae can\nbe obtained as a special case of Dain-Friedrich [7] conformally flat initial data\nthat have been written in the Newman-Penrose formalism, or more simply by a\ndirect integration of the momentum constraint equations (21-23).\nOur idea is to obtain the momentum constraint solutions as a deformation\nof the above flat background formulae with a as the deformation parameter.\nThus we look for solutions in the form\nK\u0302ij (a) = K\u0302ij (a = 0) + \u03b4 K\u0302ij (a).\n\n(33)\n\nwhere K\u0302ij (a = 0) are given above and \u03b4 K\u0302ij (a) will be found numerically from\n(20),(21-22) with appropriate boundary conditions which will be discussed below.\n\n3.2\n\nHamiltonian constraint\n\nNumerical methods are necessary in order to solve the hamiltonian constraint in\nboth flat and Weyl background metric. This constraint is a quasilinear elliptic\nequation and can be solved by the standard Newton method. The equation has\nthe form\nL\u03c8\n\n= F (r, \u03b8, \u03c8),\n\nF (r, \u03b8, \u03c8)\n\n\u22127\n\n= f (r, \u03b8)\u03c8\n\n(34)\n,\n\n(35)\n\nwhere L is a linear operator and F, f are arbitrary functions. Let \u03c8n be the n-th\napproximation in the Newton sequence. Then the following reccurence formula\n5\n\n\fcan be easily obtained\n(L \u2212 F\u03c8 (r, \u03b8, \u03c8n ))\u03b4\u03c8n = F (r, \u03b8, \u03c8n ) \u2212 F (r, \u03b8, \u03c8n\u22121 ),\n\u2212F\u03c8 (r, \u03b8, \u03c8n\u22121 )(\u03c8n \u2212 \u03c8n\u22121 ).\nHere \u03b4\u03c8n is a correction to the n-th approximation and F\u03c8 denotes the partial\nderivative of F with respect to \u03c8. It is important that the conformal factor \u03c8\n(19) is the analytical solution of (9) for Kerr initial data. Therefore it is an\nexcellent example for testing of numerical methods and can serve as the 0-th\norder approximation to more complicated cases.\n\n3.3\n\nBowen-York boundary conditions\n\nBowen and York demand the metric \u03b3ij and the external curvature Kij to be\ninvariant (up to a sign) under inversion through a sphere of radius b [1], [4].\nThis transformation is given in spherical coordinates by\nr\u0304 =\n\nb2\n, \u03b8\u0304 = \u03b8, \u03c6\u0304 = \u03c6.\nr\n\n(36)\n\nThe metric \u03b3ij is invariant if the background metric \u03b3\u0302ij is flat and if the conformal factor \u03c8(r, \u03b8, \u03c6) satisfies\nb\n\u03c8(r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = \u03c8(r\u0304, \u03b8\u0304, \u03c6\u0304).\nr\n\n(37)\n\nThe same holds true for Weyl background metric (13) if the function q(r, \u03b8) is\ninvariant under the inversion transformation. This is the case for the Kerr metric\nwith b given in (18). The invariance of the extrinsic curvature is equivalent to\nthe following transformation rules\n6\n\nK\u0302rr (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = \u00b1 rb6 K\u0302rr (r\u0304, \u03b8\u0304, \u03c6\u0304),\n4\n\nK\u0302r\u03b8 (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = \u2213 rb4 K\u0302r\u03b8 (r\u0304, \u03b8\u0304, \u03c6\u0304),\n2\n\nK\u0302\u03b8\u03b8 (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = \u00b1 rb2 K\u0302\u03b8\u03b8 (r\u0304, \u03b8\u0304, \u03c6\u0304),\n\n(38)\n\n2\n\nK\u0302\u03b8\u03c6 (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = \u2213 rb2 K\u0302\u03b8\u03c6 (r\u0304, \u03b8\u0304, \u03c6\u0304),\n2\n\nK\u0302\u03c6\u03c6 (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = \u00b1 rb2 K\u0302\u03c6\u03c6 (r\u0304, \u03b8\u0304, \u03c6\u0304).\nWe construct a family of invariant solutions of momentum constraints (11) for\nthe flat background metric by putting the generating function W (r, \u03b8) in formulae (28-30) equal to\n3\nb2\n\u2202y W (r, \u03b8) = \u2212 P (r \u00b1 ) sin2 \u03b8g(\u03b8),\n2\nr\n\n(39)\n\nwhere P is a parameter and g(\u03b8) an arbitrary function. Let us note that for\ng(\u03b8) = 1 a Bowen-York solution is usually written in cartesian coordinates in\n6\n\n\fthe form [1]\n3\n3b2\nk\n(P\nn\n+P\nn\n\u2212(\u03b7\n\u2212n\nn\n)P\nn\n)\u2213\n(Pi nj +Pj ni \u2212(\u03b7ij \u22125ni nj )P k nk ),\ni\nj\nj\ni\nij\ni\nj\nk\n2r2\n2r4\n(40)\nwhere ni is the unit normal to a sphere r = const. In this case Pi is the total\nlinear momentum\nZ\n1\nPi =\nKij d2 S j ,\n(41)\n8\u03c0\nK\u0302ij =\n\ndirected along z-axis. The appropriate formulae for the Weyl background metric\nresult from (39) plus some corrections (which become zero for a = 0) that\nsatisfy symmetry conditions (38). We get the following boundary conditions for\ncorrections to the extrinsic curvature functions (22)\n\u2202r \u03b4f11 (b, \u03b8) + 1b \u03b4f11 (b, \u03b8) = 0,\n\u03b4f12 (b, \u03b8) = 0,\nlimr\u2192\u221e \u03b4f11 (r, \u03b8) = limr\u2192\u221e \u03b4f12 (r, \u03b8) = 0.\n\nThe function f22 can be chosen arbitrary. It is reasonable to keep the same\nrelation between f11 and f22 as in the flat background case, that is\n1\nf11 + f22 = 0.\n2\nThe boudary conditions for the conformal factor \u03c8 result from (37) (and asymptotical flatness) and read as\n1\n\u03c8(b, \u03b8) = 0,\n\u2202r \u03c8(b, \u03b8) + 2b\nlimr\u2192\u221e \u03c8(r, \u03b8) = 1.\n\n3.4\n\nPuncture boundary conditions\n\nIn the Bowen-York approach each slice consists of two isomorphic ends (the\ninversion transformation (36) defines an isometry of the physical metric) separated by a sphere of radius b and we can limit ourselves to one end without any\nsingularities. The puncture method takes care of singularities in another way.\nIn the flat background case we start with the curvature generated by\n3\n\u2202y W (r, \u03b8) = \u2212 P rsin2 \u03b8g(\u03b8),\n2\n\n(42)\n\nand continue with the conformal factor of the form\nm\n+ \u03b4\u03c8,\n(43)\n2r\nwhere \u03b4\u03c8 is assumed to be nonsingular on the whole initial slice. Inserting (43)\ninto (9) it can be easily seen that the admissible singularities (at r = 0) in\n\u03c8 =1+\n\n7\n\n\fcurvature functions are of type at most r\u22123 . That is why the term of order r\u22121\nfrom (39) had to be excluded in (42).\nThe above formulae can be generalized to the Kerr background case in the\nfollowing manner. The flat curvature functions are completed by (a-dependent)\ncorrections in order to satisfy momentum constraint equations (22). These\ncorrections are expected to be nonsingular. The form of the conformal factor\n(43) is changed to\n\u03c8punc = \u03c8 + \u03b4\u03c8,\n(44)\nwhere \u03c8 is given in (19). The correction \u03b4\u03c8 must also be nonsingular. This\nbecomes clear if we compare (43) with the asymptotic expansions of \u03c8 near\nr = 0 and r = \u221e\n\u03c8(r \u2248 0, \u03b8) =\n\n\u221a\n\nm2 \u2212a2\n2r\n\n+\n\n\u221a m\nm2 \u2212a2\n\n\u03c8(r \u2192 \u221e, \u03b8) = 1 +\n\nm\n2r\n\n+\n\n+\n\n2\n\u221a a r 3\nm2 \u2212a2\n\n1 a2\n8 r2\n\n+ O(r2 ),\n\n+ O( r13 ).\n\nLet us note that the boundary conditions for r \u2192 \u221e are the same as in the\nBowen-York case, for instance\nlim \u03b4\u03c8(r, \u03b8) = 0.\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n4\n4.1\n\nNumerical results\nNumerical techniques\n\nThe first step is to find the mapping of the radial coordinate onto some compact\ninterval. In the Bowen-York case we have used a new coordinate x defined by\nb\nx= ,\nr\nwhich mapps the interval [b, \u221e) onto [0, 1]. Similarly, for puncture boundary\nconditions we have put\nr\n.\n1+r\nIn both cases we have to solve elliptic partial differential equations on the rectangle [[0, 1], [\u22121, 1]] with mixed boundary conditions. These equations for extrinsic curvature and conformal factor have been solved on a dense lattice with\n5000x200 points with the help of excellent numerical algorithms for sparse linear\nsystems: MUMPS [13], UMFPACK [14] and HYPRE [15]. The precision was\ntested on the conformal factor of the Kerr solution (19), and for instance the\nmass parameter was recovered with the relative error less than 10\u22124 .\nWe have achieved still better precision using finite elements method (FEM).\nThis method is based on triangulations which can be fitted to a shape of succesive approximations of the solution. Especially powerfull has turned out to\nbe the program FreeFem++ [8] which is an implementation of the special language dedicated to the finite element method. We have used it extensively as\nx=\n\n8\n\n\fit enables one to solve easily PDE problems, both elliptic and time dependent.\nThe relative numerical precision has been improved up to 10\u22126 .\n\n4.2\n\nDetailed results\n\nOur boundary conditions assume the slices to be asymptotically flat. The ADM\nmass is defined as\np\nmADM = E 2 \u2212 P i Pi ,\n(45)\n\nwhere E is the total energy of the system\nZ\n1\nE=\u2212\nd2 S i \u2207i \u03c8 = lim 2r(\u03c8(r, \u03b8) \u2212 1),\nr\u2192\u221e\n2\u03c0 S\u221e\n\n(46)\n\nand Pi the total momentum defined in (41). The ADM mass is a parameter\nwhich shows how quickly a slice becomes flat at infinity. The minimal surface\nis in turn a closed surface which locally has a minimal area (in the riemannian\ngeometry). The following inequality has been proved for slices with the vanishing\nextrinsic curvature [16], [17]\nr\nS\n.\n(47)\nmADM \u2265\n16\u03c0\nHere m is the ADM mass and S the area of the outermost minimal surface.\nThis is the so-called Riemannian version of the Penrose inequality [18], [19].\nThe minimal surface can be found from the condition\n\u2207i ni = 0,\n\n(48)\n\n\u03b8\u00b1 = \u2207i ni \u2213 Kij ni nj = 0,\n\n(49)\n\nwhere ni is the unit vector normal to the surface. The Penrose inequality must\nbe reformulated for slices with non-vanishing extrinsic curvature. The minimal\nsurface is then replaced by an apparent horizon by which is understood a closed\ntwo-dimensional surface which obeys one of the two equations [20]\n\nwhere \u00b1 correspond to the past and future apparent horizons respectively, and\n\u03b8\u00b1 are called optical scalars. In the axially symmetric case these apparent\nhorizons satisfy the differential equations [1]\nr\u03b83 4\u03c8\u03b8\nq\u03b8\nqr\n3\n2 4\u03c8r\nr 2 ( \u03c8 \u2212 2 + cot \u03b8) \u2212 r\u03b8 ( \u03c8 \u2212 2 + r )\nq\u03b8\nqr\n2\n2 4\u03c8r\n\u03b8\n+r\u03b8 ( 4\u03c8\n\u03c8 \u2212 2 + cot \u03b8) \u2212 r ( \u03c8 \u2212 2 + r ) =\n\nr\u03b8\u03b8 +\n\nq\n1\n\u00b1 \u03c84 1 +\n\nr\u03b82 2\nr 2 (r K\u0302rr\n\n+\n\nr\u03b82\nr 2 K\u0302\u03b8\u03b8\n\n(50)\n\n\u2212 2r\u03b8 K\u0302r\u03b8 ),\n\nwith the following boundary conditions for a function r(\u03b8) at \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = \u03c0\nr\u03b8 |\u03b8=0 = r\u03b8 |\u03b8=\u03c0 = 0.\n9\n\n(51)\n\n\fThe Penrose conjecture for a slice with a non-vanishing extrinsic curvature has\nthe same form (47) as before, but S is the area of the outermost apparent horizon\nto the future instead of the minimal surface. The above formulation is one of\na number of possible wordings of the hypothesis - see [20] for an extensive\ndiscussion of various formulations of the Penrose conjecture. In fact all the\nversions described in [20] have been checked. Since the results differ very little\nand the hypotheses always stand the tests, we report here only data concerning\nthe Penrose inequality described above. This inequality is not proved as yet\nalthough there are some partial results [12], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25] and schemes\nfor the proof [26], [27]. It is widely believed that if the Penrose inequality is not\ntrue then the cosmic censorship will be broken.\nOur numerical program was the following one\n\u2022 for given values of Kerr parameters m, a solve the momentum constraints,\n\u2022 calculate the conformal\nfactor \u03c8 for several values of the black hole mo\u221a\nmentum P = Pi P i (41),\n\u2022 for each P find the ADM mass, an apparent horizon and its area\nZ a\nq\nq\n\u03c8 4 exp(\u2212 ) r\u03b82 + r2 r sin \u03b8d\u03b8,\nS = 2\u03c0\n2\n0\n\u2022 graphically show the momentum dependence of the coefficient\ns\nS\n,\n\u01ebK =\n16\u03c0m2ADM\nwhich according to the Penrose inequality should satisfy the inequality\n\u01ebK \u2264 1.\nThe numerical results are presented on three figures (Fig. 1-3) . Each of them\nshows how \u01ebK depends on momentum in case of Bowen-York and puncture\nboundary conditions.\nLet us note that this dependence is quite different for the Bowen-York and\nthe puncture boundary conditions. In the Bowen-York case the coefficient \u01ebK\nreaches some maximum, that is evident especially for big values of a.\nThere is also another inequality which is expected to hold for every axially\nsymmetric, asymptotically flat initial data. Similarly to the Penrose inequality\nwe can define a coefficient \u01ebA\ns\nS\np\n\u01ebA =\n,\n(52)\n8\u03c0(m2ADM + m4ADM \u2212 J 2 )\n\nwhere J is the total angular momentum.

Our initial data are very\nprecise and can serve as the starting point in constructing initial data for binary\nblack holes. It would be also interesting to compute the long-term numerical\nevolution of the single boosted Kerr black hole and look for the quasinormal\nmodes present in the radiation.

In our opinion these methods lead to more precise results\nthan those made on rectangular grids.
