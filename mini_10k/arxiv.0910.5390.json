Such calculations have focused first on\nthe Hilbert action, usually including also a cosmological term [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], and have been\nextended to include terms quadratic in curvature [7, 8, 9, 10] as well as higher polynomials in\nthe Ricci scalar [11, 12, 13] or in some approximation even all orders of the derivative expansion\n[14]. Similar studies have also been done in the conformal reduction of gravity, where only the\nconformal factor is dynamical [15]. The main motivation for this work has been to try to (dis)prove\nthe asymptotic safety of gravity, i.e. the existence of a fixed point with finitely many UV attractive\ndirections [16], also [17] for reviews.\nOne slightly bothering aspect of these calculations is that very often one works with quantities\nthat are scheme-dependent, i.e. depend on details of how one chooses to implement a cutoff.\nScheme dependence is nothing new in quantum field theory. It is usually taken as a sign that\nthe quantity one is calculating is not directly measurable. The leading approximation to the\nbeta functions of dimensionless coupling constants, such as Yang-Mills and Yukawa couplings in\nfour dimensions is scheme-independent. In the case of gravity the most interesting couplings,\nlike Newton's constant and the cosmological constant are dimensionful and their beta functions\nare scheme dependent even in the lowest approximation. One hopes that at least the qualitative\nfeatures of the Renormalization Group (RG) flow are scheme independent. For example, the\nexistence of a Fixed Point (FP) as well as the number of attractive/repulsive directions at the FP\nshould be scheme-independent. More quantitatively, one expects also the critical exponents at the\nFP to be scheme-independent. All the calculations performed so far support the existence of a\nFP with finitely many attractive directions. For pure gravity the number of attractive directions\nseems likely to be three [9, 11, 12, 13], in accordance with the idea of asymptotic safety. At a\nquantitative level, when using a truncation, both the position of the FP and the critical exponents\ndepend on the scheme, but there are some quantities, such as the dimensionless combination \u039bG\nwhich are much less sensitive to cutoff scheme than others.\nHere we add some tassels to this picture. We consider a class of cutoff schemes that have not\nreceived much attention in the literature, that we call \"pure\". We say that a cutoff is \"pure\" if it\ndoes not depend on any of the parameters (masses, wave function renormalizations, couplings...)\nwhich appear in the action. These cutoffs are logically at the opposite extreme of another class of\ncutoffs that depend on all the couplings of the action and are called, for reasons that will be made\nclear in section III, \"spectrally adjusted\".\nIn this note we would like to do two things. The first is to calculate the properties of the\ngravitational fixed point in the Einstein-Hilbert truncation using a pure cutoff, and compare them\nto the results of other, more popular cutoffs. This we shall do in section IV. The second is to show\nin general that whenever one uses a pure cutoff, there is a choice of parameters that will yield the\nsame FP as a spectrally adjusted cutoff. This will be the subject of sect. V.\nFor definiteness we shall discuss scheme-dependence in the context of Wetterich's exact RG\nequation [18], which uses an additive infrared cutoff. To limit the dimension of the parameter\nspace that we explore we shall keep other aspects of the cutoff and gauge choice fixed. Although\nstimulated by research on gravity, the points we make in sect. V are quite general and should\napply also to other quantum field theories and to other flow equations.\n\n2\n\n\fII.\n\nTHE FLOW EQUATION\n\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, most of the progress towards asymptotic safety of the last\nten years has come from applying functional renormalization group methods to gravity. In this\nsection we describe these tools, using first the example of a real scalar field and then describing\nsome of the modifications that are needed in the application to gravity. A general idea put forward\nby Wilson is that the functional integration should not be performed in one single step covering all\nfield fluctuations from the UV to the IR, weighting all fluctuations with the same bare action, but\nrather in a sequence of finite steps, updating the action at each step. A concrete implementation\nof this idea that is easily amenable to explicit calculations was given in 1993 by Wetterich [18]. We\nbegin from a formal functional integral\nZ\nR\n(1)\ne\u2212Wk [j] = (d\u03c6)e\u2212(S(\u03c6)+\u2206Sk (\u03c6)+ j\u03c6) ,\nwhere j is an external source and\n1\n\u2206Sk (\u03c6) =\n2\n\nZ\n\nd4 q\u03c6(\u2212q)Rk (q 2 )\u03c6(q)\n\n(2)\n\nThe effect of the new term \u2206Sk is simply to modify the (inverse) propagator of the theory: it\nreplaces q 2 by\nPk (q 2 ) = q 2 + Rk (q 2 )\n\n(3)\n\nThe kernel Rk (q 2 ) is chosen so as to suppress the propagation of the modes with momenta |q| \u226a k 2\nand tends to zero for |q| \u226b k2 so that high momentum modes are integrated out without any\nsuppression. We shall discuss the properties of this function in greater detail in section III. One\nthen defines a scale\u2013dependent effective action functional \u0393k (\u03c6), as the Legendre transform of Wk ,\nminus the term \u2206Sk that we introduced in the beginning:\nZ\n\u0393k [\u03c6] = Wk [j] \u2212 j\u03c6 \u2212 \u2206Sk (\u03c6) ,\n(4)\nwhere \u03c6 is now to be interpreted as a shorthand for h\u03c6i, the variable conjugated to j. If the\nfunctional integral is defined by an UV cutoff, then when k tends to this cutoff the average effective\naction is related by a nontrivial transformation to the bare action [20]. For k \u2192 0, \u2206Sk \u2192 0 and\none recovers the standard definition of the effective action (the generating function of one\u2013particle\u2013\nirreducible Green functions). It is not exactly the Wilsonian action but its definition is similar in\nspirit and it is somewhat easier to work with. If one evaluates this functional at one loop, it is\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u03b4 S\n1\n(1)\n+ Rk\n(5)\n\u0393k = STr log\n2\n\u03b4\u03c6\u03b4\u03c6\nand its scale dependence is given by\n1\nd\u0393k\nk\n= STr\ndk\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b42 S\n+ Rk\n\u03b4\u03c6\u03b4\u03c6\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\nk\n\ndRk\n.\ndk\n\n(6)\n\nHere STr is a trace that includes a factor \u22121 for fermionic fields and a factor 2 for complex fields.\nIt can be shown that the \"renormalization group improvement\" of this equation, which consists\n\n3\n\n\fin replacing S by \u0393k in the r.h.s., leads actually to an exact equation often called the Functional\nRenormalization Group Equation (FRGE) [18]:\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\u22121\nd\u0393k\ndRk\n\u03b4 \u0393k\n1\nk\nk\n= STr\n+ Rk\n.\n(7)\ndk\n2\n\u03b4\u03c6\u03b4\u03c6\ndk\nIt is important to observe that the last term in eq.(7) suppresses the contribution of high\nmomentum modes so that the trace is ultraviolet finite: there is no need to use any ultraviolet\nregularization. In fact, once the equation has been derived, it is actually not necessary to refer\nto the functional integral anymore. The FRGE defines a flow in the space of all theories and if\nwe start from any point and we follow the flow in the limit k \u2192 0, then we find the effective\naction, from which in principle we can derive everything we may want to know about the theory.\nConversely, by following the flow towards higher energy we can establish whether the theory has a\nFP with the desired properties.\nThe application of this equation to gravity has been discussed first in [1]. Since gravity is a\ngauge theory, one has to take into account the complications due to the gauge fixing and ghost\nterms. So far the best way to deal with these complications is to use the background field method.\nLet \u1e21\u03bc\u03bd be a fixed but otherwise arbitrary metric. We can write g\u03bc\u03bd = \u1e21\u03bc\u03bd + h\u03bc\u03bd . It is not implied\nthat h is small. We choose a gauge\u2013fixing condition\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nd4 x \u1e21 \u03c7\u03bc Y \u03bc\u03bd \u03c7\u03bd\n(8)\nSGF (\u1e21, h) =\n2\n\nwhere \u03c7\u03bd = \u2207\u03bc h\u03bc\u03bd + \u03b2\u2207\u03bd h, h = h\u03bc\u03bc and Y is some operator, which in the simplest cases is just\nequal to \u1e21\u03bc\u03bd . The standard formal manipulations in the path integral give rise to a ghost term\nZ\n\u221a\n(9)\nSc = d4 x \u1e21 C\u0304\u03bd (\u2206gh )\u03bd\u03bc C \u03bc ,\n\nand, if Y contains derivatives, also a \"third ghost\" term [12, 19]\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nd4 x \u1e21 b\u03bc Y \u03bc\u03bd b\u03bd .\nSb =\n2\n\nAlso the cutoff term \u2206Sk is written in terms of the background metric\nZ\n\u221a\n \u0304 \u03c1\u03c3\n\u2206Sk (\u1e21) = d4 x \u1e21 h\u03bc\u03bd \u1e21 \u03bc\u03c1 \u1e21 \u03bd\u03c3 Rk (\u2206)h\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\n \u0304 is some differential operator constructed with the background metric. In this way one\nwhere \u2206\nconstructs a generating functional W (j \u03bc\u03bd , \u1e21\u03bc\u03bd ) depending on sources that couple linearly to h\u03bc\u03bd ,\nand on the background metric. Applying the definition eq. (4) one obtains a functional \u0393k (h\u03bc\u03bd , \u1e21\u03bc\u03bd )\nwhere h\u03bc\u03bd is now a shorthand for hh\u03bc\u03bd i, the Legendre conjugate of j \u03bc\u03bd . One can also think of \u0393k\nas a functional of two metrics, namely hg\u03bc\u03bd i = \u1e21\u03bc\u03bd + hh\u03bc\u03bd i and the background metric. In the\nlimit k \u2192 0 this functional becomes the ordinary gravitational effective action in the background\ngauge. The functional \u0393k (g, \u1e21) is invariant under simultaneous coordinate transformations of g and\n\u1e21, the so\u2013called background gauge transformations. We will restrict our attention to the functional\n\u0393k (g) = \u0393k (g, g) obtained by the identification of the background field (which hitherto remained\ncompletely unspecified) and the vacuum expectation value g. By construction this functional\nhas the same gauge invariance as the original action and it contains the information about the\nfamiliar terms such as the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action. The functional \u0393k (g, \u1e21) contains in addition\nthe information about the k\u2013dependence of the gauge\u2013fixing terms and other genuinely bimetric\nterms in the action [21]. In the following we will ignore the RG flow of these terms. The functional\n\u0393k (g, \u1e21) obeys an FRGE that has the same form as in eq. (7), where \u03c6 now stands for h\u03bc\u03bd , C\u03bc , C\u0304\u03bc\nand b.\n4\n\n\fIII.\n\nCUTOFF SCHEMES\n\nThere is a large arbitrarines in the choice of the cutoff \u2206Sk . Let us begin by discussing the\nsimplest example: a scalar theory in flat space with the action truncated to:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1\n2\n2\n(\u2202\u03c6) + V (\u03c6 )\n(12)\nS = dx\n2\nwhere V is an even potential. The cutoff is usually written in momentum space as in eq. (2) where\nRk is a function that is only required to satisfy the boundary conditions that are appropriate to a\ncutoff, namely:\n\u2022 it tends rapidly to zero when q 2 > k2 .\n\u2022 it tends to k2 when q 2 tends to zero.\n\u2022 it is monotonically decreasing in q 2 .\n\u2022 it is monotonically decreasing in k, uniformly in q 2 .\nThe second condition is a kind of normalization and is not strictly necessary: it is possible to allow\nRk to tend to some other finite value, or even to infinity, when k \u2192 0. However, for reasons that\nwill become clear shortly, it is convenient to keep fixed the value of Rk (0). Aside from this, the\nshape of the function is arbitrary. Inserting the ansatz (12) for \u0393k , the FRGE (7) becomes\nZ\nd\u0393k\n1 1\n\u2202t Rk (z)\nk\n=\n,\n(13)\ndzz\n2\ndk\n2 (4\u03c0)\nPk (z) + 2V \u2032 + 4\u03c62 V \u2032\u2032\nwhere z = q 2 , t = log(k/k0 ) and the modified inverse propagator Pk is defined as in eq. (2).\nFrom here, taking derivatives with respect to \u03c62 , one can extract the beta functions of the\ncoefficients of the Taylor expansion of the potential. These beta functions will depend in general\non the choice of Rk . One notable exception, in four dimensions, is the beta function of the quartic\ncoupling, which in the limit where the mass and the higher couplings are negligible, turns out to\nbe independent of Rk . The way in which this happens is as follows: the trace in the r.h.s. of the\nFRGE involves an integration over q 2 . In the specific case, the function to be integrated turns out\nto be a total derivative and therefore depends only on the boundary values. Since these have been\nfixed, it is completely determined. See Appendix A in [12] for details.\nThe discussion can be refined by taking into account a wave function renormalization constant\nZ in front of the kinetic term. One then usually modifies the definition eq. (2) by including a\nfactor Z:\nZ\nZ\ndq \u03c6(\u2212q) Rk (q 2 ) \u03c6(q) .\n(14)\n\u2206Sk =\n2\nThe reason why this is convenient is that the inverse propagator Zq 2 and the cutoff ZRk (q 2 ) then\nneatly combine into a modified inverse propagator ZPk (q 2 ) and the overall factors of Z cancel\nbetween numerator and denominator of the FRGE, which takes the form\nZ\n1 1\n\u2202t Rk + \u03b7Rk (z)\nd\u0393k\n(15)\n=\ndzz\nk\n\u2032\n2 V \u2032\u2032\n2\ndk\n2 (4\u03c0)\nPk (z) + 2V +4\u03c6\nZ\nwhere we have defined \u03b7 =\n\nd log Z\nd log k .\n\n5\n\n\fThe choice of the shape of the function Rk is an aspect of the cutoff scheme which involves\ninfinitely many parameters. When one considers more complicated theories, further \"discrete\"\nchoices present themselves. For example, in the case of gravity truncated to the Hilbert action,\nthe second variation of the action has the following schematic form:\n(2)\n\n\u0393k = aZ[\u2212\u0003 + bR + c\u039b],\n\n(16)\n\nwhere Z = 1/(16\u03c0G), a, b and c are constants and \u0003 = \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bc and the curvature term R are\ncomputed with the background metric. Tensor structures are omitted, since they are not essential\nfor the argument. Since in curved spacetime one cannot use momentum space methods, in the\ndefinition of the cutoff one has to decompose the fields on a basis of eigenvectors of some selfadjoint\ndifferential operator. The cutoff then suppresses the modes with eigenvalues \u03bb < k2 (if the operator\nis of second order). One then has a choice of what operator to use. In [12] we called a cutoff of\ntype I, II or III, respectively, if it is defined using the spectrum of \u2212\u0003, \u2212\u0003 + bR or \u2212\u0003 + bR + c\u039b.\nIn the literature, an overall factor of Z = 1/(16\u03c0G) is inserted in the definition of the cutoff as in\neq. (14). In the case of gravity there are some differences. Unlike in the scalar case, the coefficient\nZ is dimensionful; even more important, one can show that Z is now an essential coupling constant\nin the sense that it cannot be eliminated by rescaling the metric without changing the unit of mass\nk [22]. In spite of these differences, it is still true that Z does not appear in the reference operator,\nso in the case of type I and II cutoffs the spectrum of the operator does not depend on k. In\nthe type III cutoff the reference operator contains the running coupling \u039b. As a consequence, also\nthe spectrum of the reference operator changes with k. For this reason this is called a \"spectrally\nadjusted cutoff\". It has been argued in [23] that such cutoffs give improved results.\nIn this paper we would like to explore in the opposite direction and consider a class of cutoff\nfunctions that do not depend on any coupling, not even on Z. Quite generally, we will refer to a\ncutoff that does not contain any parameter that appears in the action as a \"pure\" cutoff.\nIV.\n\nGRAVITATIONAL BETA FUNCTIONS\n\nWe will now discuss the example of gravity in the Einstein-Hilbert truncation, where one retains\nonly the terms with up to two derivatives of the metric:\nZ\n\u221a\n(17)\n\u0393k = dx g (2\u039bZ \u2212 ZR) + SGF + Sghost ,\nwhere Z = 1/(16\u03c0G), SGF is a gauge\u2013fixing term and Sghost is the ghost action. We decompose\n(B)\n(B)\nthe metric into g\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd + h\u03bc\u03bd where g\u03bc\u03bd is a background. We consider a de Donder background\ngauge:\nZ\nq\nZ\n(B)\n(18)\nSGF (g , h) =\ndx g(B) \u03c7\u03bc g (B)\u03bc\u03bd \u03c7\u03bd ,\n2\u03b1\nwhere\n1\n\u03c7\u03bd = \u2207\u03bc h\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u2207\u03bd h .\n2\nAll covariant derivatives are with respect to the background metric. In the following all metrics\nwill be background metrics, and we will omit the superscript (B) for notational simplicity. In order\nto restrict the number of parameters, we will fix \u03b1 = 1 which leads to considerable simplifications.\n\n6\n\n\fAfter calculating the second variation of the action, we decompose h\u03bc\u03bd into its different spin\ncomponents according to\n1\n1\nh\u03bc\u03bd = hT\u03bc\u03bd + \u2207\u03bc \u03be\u03bd + \u2207\u03bd \u03be\u03bc + \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd \u03c3 \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd \u0003\u03c3 + g\u03bc\u03bd h.\nd\nd\n\n(19)\n\nand\nC \u03bc = C T \u03bc + \u2207\u03bc C ,\n\nC\u0304\u03bc = C\u0304\u03bcT + \u2207\u03bc C\u0304 ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere hT\u03bc\u03bd is tranverse and traceless, \u03be is a transverse vector, \u03c3 and h are scalars, C T and C\u0304 T are\ntransverse vectors, and C and C\u0304 are scalars. These fields are subject to the following differential\nconstraints:\nhT\u03bc \u03bc = 0 ;\n\n\u2207\u03bd hT\u03bc\u03bd = 0 ;\n\n\u2207\u03bd \u03be\u03bd = 0 ;\n\n\u2207\u03bc C\u0304\u03bcT = 0 ;\n\n\u2207\u03bc C T \u03bc = 0 .\n\nWe further redefine\n\u03be\u03bc =\n\nr\n\nR\n\u2212\u0003 \u2212 \u03be\u0302\u03bc ,\nd\n\n\u03c3=\n\n\u221a\n\nr\n\n\u2212\u0003 \u2212\u0003 \u2212\n\nR\n\u03c3\u0302.\nd\u22121\n\n(21)\n\nwhich removes some powers of \u2212\u0003 from the second variation and furthermore cancels some Jacobian\ndeterminants that arise in the functional integral when one performs the decomposition eq. (19).\nWe then drop the hat from \u03be and \u03c3\nIn order to extract the beta functions of \u039b and Z it is enough to calculate the r.h.s. of the\nFRGE on the background of a sphere. Then the inverse propagator diagonalizes\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n2\nZ\n(2)\n\u2212\u0003 + R \u2212 2\u039b (g\u03bc\u03c1 g\u03bd\u03c3 + g \u03bc\u03c3 g\u03bd\u03c1 )\n\u0393h T h T =\n\u03bc\u03bd \u03c1\u03c3\n2\n3\n2\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n(2)\n\u0393\u03be\u03bc \u03be\u03bd = Z \u2212\u0003 + R \u2212 2\u039b g\u03bc\u03bd\n4\nZ\n(2)\n\u0393hh = \u2212 [\u2212\u0003 \u2212 2\u039b]\n8\n3Z\n(2)\n[\u2212\u0003 \u2212 2\u039b]\n\u0393\u03c3\u03c3 =\n\u0015\n\u00148\n1\n(2)\n\u0393C\u0304 T C T = \u0003 + R g\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc \u03bd\n4\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n(2)\n\u0393C\u0304C = \u0003 + R\n(22)\n2\nNow we define the cutoff. We require that after adding the cutoff, the modified inverse propagator\nhas the same form as in (22) except for the replacement of \u2212\u0003 by Pk (\u2212\u0003), where Pk is defined as\nin eq. (3). This means that when the inverse propagator has the form eq. (16), the cutoff is\nRk = aZRk (\u2212\u0003) .\n\n(23)\n\nThis type of cutoff was introduced in [2] and studied in greater generality in [4].

The last\ntwo contributions come from the transverse and longitudinal components of the ghosts. A prime\nor a double prime indicate that the first or the first and second eigenvalues have to be omitted\nfrom the trace.

The FP now\ndepends on the arbitrary parameter \u03b3, which is part of the freedom in the definition of the cutoff.\nThis reflects itself in the position of the fixed point, as shown in Figure 1. We give separately the\ndependence of G\u0303\u2217 , \u039b\u0303\u2217 and of the dimensionless product \u039b\u2217 G\u2217 . We see that as \u03b3 varies over four\norders of magnitude, G\u0303\u2217 , \u039b\u0303\u2217 each vary by less than one order of magnitude, and \u039b\u2217 G\u2217 changes just\nby a factor smaller than 2. It had been observed before that the dimensionless product \u039bG has a\n9\n\n\fbeta function that is gauge independent in lowest order in an expansion in \u039b\u0303 [2]; also its value at\nthe FP was found to be quite insensitive to the choice of gauge and cutoff. Our findings confirm this\npicture also for the dependence on the parameter \u03b3. In figure 2 we also give the critical exponents\nas functions of \u03b3. As with other cutoffs, they form a complex conjugate pair, but for large \u03b3 the\nimaginary part of the eigenvalue goes to zero and for \u03b3 > 60 we find two real eigenvalues. Clearly\nfor very large or very small \u03b3 the properties of the FP are significantly affected, but there is a wide\nrange of values for which the properties of the FP are quite stable.\nWe observe that the curves in Figure 1 pass through the position of the fixed point in the type\nIb cutoff examined previously, which is marked by a dot in the graphs. In other words, there is\na value of \u03b3 for which the pure cutoff gives a FP in the same position as the type Ib cutoff. The\ncorresponding value is precisely \u03b3 = Z\u0303\u2217 = 0.0284. It would seem from (28) that the beta functions\nbecome singular when \u03b3 = Z\u0303 but if we put \u03b3 = Z\u0303 + \u01eb and expand in powers of \u01eb, the coefficient of\nthe negative powers of \u01eb cancel out. Furthermore, one finds that the leading (\u01eb-independent) terms\nin the expansion coincide with the first two terms on the r.h.s. of (25). There is clearly something\nspecial happening when \u03b3 has the value of Z\u0303\u2217 in the type Ib cutoff. In the next section we will\nexplain the origin of this coincidence and we will see that it holds in much greater generality.\nV.\n\nFIXED POINTS WITH PURE AND SPECTRALLY ADJUSTED CUTOFFS\n\nWe have shown in the previous section, in the special case of gravity in the Einstein Hilbert\ntruncation, that there is a value of the parameter \u03b3 for which a pure cutoff reproduces the results\nof a type I cutoff. In this section we argue that this property is quite general. Since we are going\nto move to a much more general setting we will have to make some choices in order to somehow\ncircumscribe the scope of the argument.\nWe assume that \u0393k admits a derivative expansion of the form\nX\ngi Oi ,\n(29)\n\u0393k =\ni\n\nwhere Oi are operators and gi are numerical parameters depending on k. The operators Oi are\nintegrals of the form\nZ\n\u221a\n(30)\nOi =\ndd x g\u03a9i ,\nwhere \u03a9i are (possibly nonpolynomial) functions of the fields and their derivatives, respecting all\nthe symmetries that the theory is supposed to possess. In gauge theories, \u03a9i are constructed with\ncovariant derivatives and curvatures. The number of derivatives increases with i, but the precise\ncorrespondence need not be spelled out here.\nSome of the parameters appearing in the expansion may be eliminated by field redefinitions.\nThis is the case, for example, for the wave function renormalization constants. Such parameters\nare said to be \"redundant\" or \"inessential\" [25]. We assume that the theory has been parametrized\nin such a way that a certain subset of the gi is redundant, while the remaining ones are \"essential\".\nThe fields do not have any scale dependence, so that\nk\n\nX\nd\u0393k\n=\n\u03b2i Oi ,\ndk\n\n(31)\n\ni\n\ni\nwhere \u03b2i (gj , k) = k dg\ndk are the beta functions. In general they depend on all the gi and also\nexplicitly on k. Note that we call \"beta functions\" the derivatives of the parameters appearing in\n\n10\n\n\fthe action whether they are essential or not. One sometimes prefers to call \"anomalous dimensions\"\nthe (logarithmic) derivatives of irrelevant parameters such as the wave function renormalization\nconstants. We will not need to make this terminological distinction here. We will call \u03b2 (without\nsubscript i) the \"beta functional\" on the r.h.s. of the FRGE\nX\n\u03b2=\n\u03b2i Oi .\ni\n\nIf the operator \u03a9i has dimension \u03b1i , Oi has dimension \u03b1i \u2212 d and gi has dimension di = d \u2212 \u03b1i .\nOne can now define dimensionless couplings g\u0303i and dimensionless\noperators \u00d5i by gi = kdi g\u0303i and\nP\n\u2212d\ni\nOi = k \u00d5i , so that eq. (29) can also be written as \u0393k = i g\u0303i \u00d5i . The condition that has to be\nsatisfied by a FP is\nk\n\ndg\u0303i\n=0,\ndk\n\n(32)\n\nfor all essential couplings gi . We can rewrite this as follows. From the definition of g\u0303i we obtain\n\u2202t gi = di gi + kdi \u2202t g\u0303i . Then we can rewrite eq. (31) as\nk\n\nX\nX\nd\u0393k\n=\ndi g\u0303i \u00d5i +\n\u2202t g\u0303i \u00d5i .\ndk\ni\n\ni\n\nThen the FP equation can be written compactly as\n!\nX\n\u2212\ndi g\u0303i \u00d5i + \u03b2\ni\n\n=0\n\n(33)\n\nessential\n\nwhere the subscript \"essential\" means that the equation has to be projected on the subspace of\nessential couplings. The individual equations eq. (32) can be obtained from the functional equation\nby extracting the coefficient of the operator \u00d5i . We will now compare the functional form of this\nequation for two classes of cutoffs.\nFor definiteness we start by choosing a \"spectrally adjusted\" cutoff, defined as follows. The\nsecond variation of the action is a differential operator\n\u2206(gi ) =\n\nX \u03b42 Oi\n\u03b4 2 \u0393k\n=\ngi\n.\n\u03b4\u03c6\u03b4\u03c6\n\u03b4\u03c6\u03b4\u03c6\n\n(34)\n\ni\n\nBy this notation we emphasize that the operator depends on all the parameters gi . In the case\nof gauge theories the operator \u2206 is constructed with the covariant derivative \u2207\u03bc . We choose the\ncutoff R to be a function of the full operator \u2206: Rk = Rk (\u2206(gi )), where Rk is one of the functions\nthat were discussed in section III. Then the modified inverse propagator is\n\u2206(gi ) + Rk (\u2206(gi )) = Pk (\u2206(gi )) ,\n\n(35)\n\nwhere Pk is defined as in eq. (3). This is a cutoff of \"type III\", in the terminology of [12]. It is\nspectrally adjusted because it manifestly depends on all the couplings, masses and wave function\nrenormalizations.\nThe r.h.s. of the FRGE can now be written\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202Rk (\u2206(gi ))\n\u2202\u2206\n1\n\u2032\n+ Rk (\u2206(gi ))\n\u03b2i ,\n(36)\n\u03b2 = STr \u2206(gi ) + Rk (\u2206(gi ))\n2\n\u2202t\n\u2202gi\nwhere a prime indicates the derivative of the function with respect to its argument. In the first\nterm one derives only the explicit dependence of the cutoff on k and in the second the dependence\n11\n\n\fthat comes from the flow of the gi . From here the beta functions \u03b2i can be obtained in a two step\nprocedure. First one has to extract from eq. (36) the coefficient of Oi . Formally we can write\n\u03b2i =\n\n\u03b4\u03b2\n\u03b4Oi\n\nThis is usually the most labor-intensive part of the calculation, but still it does not immediately\ngive the beta function, because the r.h.s. is itself a linear combination of the beta functions, of the\nform\n\u03b4\u03b2\n= Bi + Aij \u03b2j .\n\u03b4Oi\nwhere Bi are the one loop beta functions and Aij are calculable coefficients. The beta functions\ncan be obtained by solving this linear system:\n\u03b2i = (1 \u2212 A)\u22121\nij Bj .\nIf one is only interested in the location of the FP, one can avoid this step by the following trick\n[26]. Since at a FP gi = g\u0303i\u2217 kdi , for some constants g\u0303i\u2217 , we obtain an equivalent set of FP equations\nif in the beta functional we replace \u03b2i by di gi = di g\u0303i kdi . This modified beta functional is\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u2202Rk (\u2206(gi ))\n\u2202\u2206\n\u2032\ndi\n\u03b2\u0304 = STr \u2206(gi ) + Rk (\u2206(gi ))\n+ Rk (\u2206(gi ))\ndi g\u0303i k\n(37)\n2\n\u2202t\n\u2202gi\nIf we define\n\u03b2\u0304i =\n\n\u03b4\u03b2\u0304\n\u03b4Oi\n\nthese expressions do not contain the \u03b2 functions anymore, and so they can be plugged directly\nin the FP equation. The FP equations obtained from the modified beta functions \u03b2\u0304i have the\nsame FP solutions as the ones obtained from the true beta functions \u03b2i . We observe that the\nsecond term on the r.h.s. of eq. (37) is not just a function of \u2206. In general it is a complicated\noperator that will not commute with \u2206 itself. We actually do not have the mathematical tools to\nextract beta functions from such complicated traces involving functions of several noncommuting\noperators. However, calculability is not required here, so we can proceed formally. We now simply\nassume that the FP equations determined in this way have a solution at g\u0303i = g\u0303i\u2217 .\nThe source of gi -dependence in the cutoff definition given above is the operator \u2206. We can turn\nthe cutoff into a pure cutoff if we replace all the couplings appearing in \u2206 by arbitrary constants,\nmultiplied by suitable powers of k to preserve the correct dimensionalities. The cutoff is then\nRk (\u2206(\u03b3i kdi ))). With this cutoff the r.h.s. of the FRGE reads\n\u0013\n\u0010\n\u0011\u22121 \u0012 \u2202R (\u2206(\u03b3 kdi ))\n1\ni\nk\ndi \u2202\u2206\ndi\n\u2032\ndi\n+ Rk (\u2206(\u03b3i k ))\ndi \u03b3i k\n(38)\n\u03b2 = STr \u2206(gi ) + Rk (\u2206(\u03b3i k ))\n2\n\u2202t\n\u2202gi\nFrom here one can extract beta functions\n\u03b2i (gi , \u03b3i ) =\n\n\u03b4\u03b2\n\u03b4Oi\n\nthat can be used to write FP equations. These FP equations depend parametrically on the arbitrary\nnumbers \u03b3i . Recalling that gi = g\u0303i kdi and comparing eq. (38) to eq. (37) we see that the only\ndifference lies in the replacement of g\u0303i by \u03b3i in certain functional dependences.\n12\n\n\fIt is clear that since the FP equation for the spectrally adjusted cutoff has a zero when we\nreplace everywhere g\u0303i by the numbers g\u0303i\u2217 , then the FP equation for the pure cutoff will also have\na zero when we replace all the \u03b3i and all the g\u0303i by g\u0303i\u2217 . Therefore with the particular choice of\nparameters \u03b3i = g\u0303i\u2217 , the pure cutoff produces a FP in the same position as the spectrally adjusted\ntype III cutoff.\nThis result has been derived using what we call a \"type III\" cutoff, because the argument is\neasier to make independently of the form of the action, but we believe that it holds more generally,\nalso for other cutoffs. To illustrate this consider a generalization of what was called a \"type I\"\ncutoff in [12]. In a gauge theory the second variation defined in eq. (34) is a differential operator\nconstructed with the covariant derivative \u2207\u03bc . Let us assume that the truncation of the theory is\nsuch that \u2206 depends on \u2207\u03bc only through the combination \u2212\u0003 = \u2212\u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bc . To make this explicit\nlet us write it as \u2206(\u2212\u0003, gi ). A generalized type I cutoff can be defined by the requirement that\nthe modified inverse propagator has the same form as the original one except for the replacement\nof \u2212\u0003 by Pk (\u2212\u0003):\nRk (\u2212\u0003, gi ) = \u2206(Pk (\u2212\u0003), gi ) \u2212 \u2206(\u2212\u0003, gi ) .\nThe beta functional that one obtains with this cutoff has the form\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u2202\u2206 \u2202Pk (\u2212\u0003)\n1\n\u22121\n+\n\u2206(Pk (\u2212\u0003), gi ) \u2212 \u2206(\u2212\u0003, gi ) \u03b2i\n\u03b2 = STr (\u2206(Pk (\u2212\u0003), gi ))\n2\n\u2202(\u2212\u0003)\n\u2202t\n\u2202gi\n\n(39)\n\n(40)\n\nwhich upon use of the trick explained above yields equivalent FP equations as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n\u2202\n\u2202\u2206 \u2202Pk (\u2212\u0003)\n\u22121\ndi\n\u03b2\u0304 = STr (\u2206(Pk (\u2212\u0003), gi ))\n+\n\u2206(Pk (\u2212\u0003), gi ) \u2212 \u2206(\u2212\u0003, gi ) di g\u0303i k\n2\n\u2202(\u2212\u0003)\n\u2202t\n\u2202gi\n(41)\nAgain we can define a pure cutoff of generalized type I by replacing gi by \u03b3i kdi in Rk\nRk (\u2212\u0003, \u03b3i kdi ) = \u2206(Pk (\u2212\u0003), \u03b3i kdi ) \u2212 \u2206(\u2212\u0003, \u03b3i kdi ) .\n\nThe beta functional that one obtains with this cutoff has the form\n\u0011\u22121\n\u0010\n1\n\u00d7\n\u03b2 = STr \u2206(Pk (\u2212\u0003), \u03b3i kdi ) + \u2206(\u2212\u0003, gi ) \u2212 \u2206(\u2212\u0003, \u03b3k di )\n2\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u2202\u2206 \u2202Rk (\u2212\u0003)\n\u2202\u2206\n\u2202\u2206\ndi\ndi\ndi\n+\n(Pk (\u2212\u0003), \u03b3i k ) \u2212\n(\u2212\u0003, \u03b3i k ) di \u03b3i k\n\u2202(\u2212\u0003)\n\u2202t\n\u2202gi\n\u2202gi\n\n(42)\n\n(43)\n\nAgain we see that the two beta functionals have the same form except for the replacement of\ng\u0303i by \u03b3i in certain functional dependences; additional terms in the first factor cancel for \u03b3i = g\u0303i .\nTherefore the argument given above shows that if we set \u03b3i = g\u0303i\u2217 the pure cutoff will have a FP in\nthe same position as the generalized type I cutoff.\nThe reason why this discussion is less general than the previous one is that this type of cutoff\ncould only be defined if the inverse propagator has a specific form. It may be possible to generalize\nthis argument, for example defining the cutoff by the rule\nr\nPk (\u2212\u0003)\n\u2207\u03bc .\n\u2207\u03bc 7\u2192\n\u2212\u0003\nWe will not pursue this further. The discussion of the type III cutoff is sufficient to make the\npoint in generality. Furthermore, the type III cutoff is \"ideologically\" at the opposite extreme of a\npure cutoff, being always fully dependent on all couplings. This is also supported by the numerical\nresults, which show that type III cutoffs yield fixed points at at the extreme end of the range of\nvariation [12]. So it is somewhat reassuring that one can reproduce at least the FP position of a\nspectrally adjusted, type III cutoff by a pure cutoff.\n\n13\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nR.P. would like to thank M.
