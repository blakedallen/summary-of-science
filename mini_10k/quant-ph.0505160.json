In quantum teleportation,\nan unknown quantum state will be sent from sender to\nreceiver via a quantum channel with the help of classical communication. During this process, the sender will\noperate a joint Bell-state measurement on the unknownstate particle and one of the entangled particles she possesses [1]. In entanglement swapping, there are usually\nthree spatially separate users, and two of them have\nshared one pair of entangled particles with the third\nuser. Then the third user will operate a joint Bell-state\nmeasurement on the two particles he possesses. Corresponding to the measurement result, the two particles\npossessed by the two spatially separate users will collapse into an entangled state without any entanglement\nbefore the joint measurement [2]. In remote state preparation [3], if we want to prepare some entangled state\nremotely via two pairs of entangled particles as the quantum channel, the joint measurement is also a necessity [4].\nLike the above-mentioned entanglement swapping, there\nare usually three spatially separate users, and two of\nthem have shared one pair of entangled particles with\nthe third user. Then the third user user will operate a\nspecial type of joint measurement, which corresponds to\nthe entangled state the third user want to prepare remotely, on the two particles he possesses. After the third\nuser informs the first or the second user the measurement results, the particles of the first and the second user\nare prepared in the entangled state that the third user\nwant to prepare remotely. In addition, joint measurements are also needed in the quantum dense coding [5].\nThe sender and the receiver share an entangled pairs,\nand the sender will encode the 2-bit classical information\non the entangled particle he possesses by operating four\npossible single-bit operations on the particle. Then this\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: mingyang@ahu.edu.cn\naddress: zlcao@ahu.edu.cn\n\nparticle(one qubit) will be sent to the receiver. The receiver will operate a joint Bell-state measurement on the\ntwo particles to decode the 2-bit classical information the\nsender encoded.\nForm the above analysis, joint measurements are\nneeded in quantum teleportation, entanglement swapping, remote preparation of entangled state via two pairs\nof entangled particles as the quantum channel and quantum dense coding, etc. But it is very difficult to realize\njoint measurements in experiment. Usually, joint measurements will be converted into the product of separate\nmeasurements on single particle [6, 7, 8, 9]. For the photon case, teleportation of unknown polarization state of\nphotons has been realized in experiment [10], where the\njoint Bell-state measurement has been converted into the\nproduct of separate measurements on single photon by\nusing the linear optical elements, such as polarization\nbeam splitters and photon detectors. But in this experimental scheme, the four Bell states can not be discriminated conclusively and completely. So Zhao et al proposed an alternative scheme for the conclusive discrimination of the four Bell states of photons with the help\nof the ancillary entangled pairs of photons [8]. In cavity\nQED domain, the Bell-state measurement on atoms has\nbeen converted into the separate measurements on single\natom by using the controlled-NOT (C-NOT) gate operations [6], where the dispersive interaction between two\natoms and a cavity mode plays an important role. To\navoid the difficulty of the C-NOT gate operations, Zheng\nand Ye all proposed the schemes to teleport an unknown\natomic state without Bell-state measurement, and the interaction between atoms and cavity modes decomposes\nthe Bell states into product states.\nFrom the experimental point of view, Bell-state measurements have been realized for the photon case. However, because it is difficult to realize Bell-state measurements for atomic (ionic) states in experiment [11, 12],\nthe implementation of quantum teleportation [11, 12],\nentanglement swapping, remote preparation of entangled\nstate and quantum dense coding for atomic (ionic) states\nare all not easy. In our previous contribution, we have\nproposed the entanglement swapping scheme for atomic\nsystem without joint measurement [13, 14], where the in-\n\n\f2\n\nALICE\n\nV\n\n\u000e\n\nV\n\n\u0010\n\nU\n\ne\n\nBOB\nBS2\n\nBS1\n\n3\nL\nIncident\nPhoton\n\ng\n\nm\u000e\n\nDu\n\n1\n\nm\u0010\n\nFIG. 1: Level configuration of the ions used in the scheme.\nThe ions, which are in the degenerate states |m+ i and |m\u2212 i,\ncan be excited into the unstable excited state |ei by absorbing\none \u03c3 + or \u03c3 \u2212 polarized photon, then it can decay to the stable\nground state |gi with a scattered photon rapidly.\n\nteraction (resonant and nonresnant cases) between atoms\nand cavity modes replaces the Bell-state analyzer. But,\ndue to the complexity of the cavity QED techniques, it\nis difficult to realize these schemes in experiment. So,\nin this paper, we will propose an alternative scheme for\nsome quantum information processes for ions, such as,\nquantum teleportation, entanglement concentration via\nentanglement swapping and remote preparation of entangled states, etc. We will use the linear optical elements. The main setup of the scheme is a Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometers (MZI) with two ions placed on the two\narms of the MZI. We can decide whether the scheme succeed or not by operating single photon measurements on\nthe two output ports of the MZI. The unique advantage\nof the current scheme is that the quantum information\nprocessing for ions can be realized by using linear optical\nelements, which decreases the difficulty of the experimental implementation. In addition, by using the MZI, the\njoint measurement are all decomposed into single photon measurements and single ion measurements, so the\ncurrent scheme avoids the difficulty of realizing joint measurements.\n\nII. QUANTUM TELEPORTATION OF\nUNKNOWN IONIC STATES VIA LINEAR\nOPTICS\n\nConsider the three-level ionic system, where\n|m+ i and |m\u2212 i are two degenerate metastable states of\nions, and |ei is the excited state. The level configuration\nof the ions is depicted in Fig.1. The ions can be excited\nfrom |m+ i or |m\u2212 i to the excited states |ei by absorbing\none \u03c3 + or \u03c3 \u2212 circular polarization photon with unit\nefficiency. Because the excited state |ei is not a stable\none, the ions in that state will decay rapidly to the\nstable ground state |gi with a scattered photon |Si.\n\nDl\n\n2\n\nFIG. 2: The setup for teleportation scheme. Alice places ions\n1, 2 on the upper arm and lower arm of the MZI, respectively.\nOne \u03c3 + polarized photon will be superimposed on the first\nbeam splitter (BS1 ). After the BS1 the photon will take two\npossible pathes (u denotes the upper path and l denotes the\nlower one). Reflected by two mirrors, the two possible pathes\nwill be recombined at the second beam splitter (BS2 ). Single\nphoton detection will be operated on the two output ports of\nthe MZI after the BS2 . If the right lower output port detector\n(Dl ) fires, the teleportation can succeed.\n\nThis process can be expressed as [15, 16]:\na+\n\u00b1 |0i|m\u00b1 i \u2212\u2192 |Si|gi.\n\n(1)\n\nSuppose the unknown state of ion 1 to be teleported\nis:\n|\u03a8i1 = \u03b1|m+ i1 + \u03b2|m\u2212 i1 ,\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 are normalization coefficients,\n|\u03b2|2 = 1. Without loss of generality, we can\n\u03b1, \u03b2 are all real numbers.\nBefore teleportation, the sender (Alice)\nceiver (Bob) share a maximally entangled\n2, 3:\n\n(2)\nand |\u03b1|2 +\nassume that\nand the repair of ions\n\n1\n|\u03a8i23 = \u221a (|m+ i2 |m+ i3 + |m\u2212 i2 |m\u2212 i3 ).\n2\n\n(3)\n\nAlice possesses the ions 1, 2, and Bob has access to ion 3.\nTo complete the teleportation of unknown state of ion 1,\na MZI will be introduced at Alice's location. The ions 1,\n2 will be placed on upper arm and lower arm of the MZI,\nrespectively, by using trapping technology [17]. One \u03c3 +\npolarized photon will be superimposed on the MZI from\nthe left lower input port. The main setup is depicted in\nFig.2. The effect of the BS on the input photon can be\nexpressed as:\n1 +\nBS\n+\na+\nl,\u00b1 |0i \u2212\u2192 \u221a (au,\u00b1 + ial,\u00b1 )|0i,\n2\n\n(4a)\n\n1 +\nBS\n+\na+\nu,\u00b1 |0i \u2212\u2192 \u221a (al,\u00b1 + iau,\u00b1 )|0i,\n2\n\n(4b)\n\nwhere l and u denote the lower optical path and the up+\nper optical path, respectively. a+\nl,\u00b1 |0i and au,\u00b1 |0i denote\ntwo photons, and \u00b1 denotes the direction of polarization.\n\n\f3\nFrom Eq.(4) we found that there will be a \u03c02 phase shift\nbetween the input photon and the reflected wave function, and the transparent part is synchronized with the\ninput photon. The BS takes no effect on the polarization\nof the input photon. Because the ions 1, 2 have been\nplaced on the two optical pathes (u and l, respectively),\nthe ions will interact with the photon. The interaction\nwill generate a shift of interference after the BS2 , then\nAlice will detect the two output ports of the MZI to check\nwhether the teleportation succeeds or not. These are critical to the teleportation and the other quantum information processes to be presented in the current scheme.\nBefore teleportation the total state of the system is:\n|\u03a8itotal =\n+\n+\n+\n\n1\n\u221a a+\nl,+ |0i(\u03b1|m+ i1 |m+ i2 |m+ i3\n2\n\u03b1|m+ i1 |m\u2212 i2 |m\u2212 i3\n\u03b2|m\u2212 i1 |m+ i2 |m+ i3\n\u03b2|m\u2212 i1 |m\u2212 i2 |m\u2212 i3 ).\n\n(5)\n\nTo analyze the evolution of the total system, we will\nconsider the evolution of the following four product states\nof ions 1, 2:\nBS1 ,Ions1,2,BS2\n\n\u2192\na+\nl,+ |0i|m+ i1 |m+ i2 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\n\u221a1 (|Si1 |gi1 |m+ i2\n2\n\n+ i|m+ i1 |Si2 |gi2 ),\n\n(6a)\n\nBS1 ,Ions1,2,BS2\n\na+\nl,+ |0i|m+ i1 |m\u2212 i2 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\u221a1 |Si1 |gi1 |m\u2212 i2\n2\n+\ni\n+ 2 (au,+ + ia+\nl,+ )|0i|m+ i1 |m\u2212 i2\n\n(6b)\n\nBS1 ,Ions1,2,BS2\n\na+\nl,+ |0i|m\u2212 i1 |m+ i2 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\u221ai |m\u2212 i1 |Si2 |gi2\n2\n1 +\n+ 2 (al,+ + ia+\nu,+ )|0i|m\u2212 i1 |m+ i2 ,\n\n(6c)\n\nBS1 ,Ions1,2,BS2\n\na+\nl,+ |0i|m\u2212 i1 |m\u2212 i2 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nia+\nu,+ |0i|m\u2212 i1 |m\u2212 i2 .\n\n(6d)\n\nSo, after the operation of MZI, the state of the total\nsystem will evolve into:\n\u2032\n1\n1\n|\u03a8itotal = \u221a {\u03b1 \u221a (|Si1 |gi1 |m+ i2\n2\n2\n\n1\n+ i|m+ i1 |Si2 |gi2 )|m+ i3 + \u03b1[ \u221a |Si1 |gi1 |m\u2212 i2\n2\ni +\n+\n+ (au,+ + ial,+ )|0i|m+ i1 |m\u2212 i2 ]|m\u2212 i3\n2\ni\n+ \u03b2[ \u221a |m\u2212 i1 |Si2 |gi2\n2\n1 +\n+ (al,+ + ia+\nu,+ )|0i|m\u2212 i1 |m+ i2 ]|m+ i3\n2\n(7)\n+ i\u03b2a+\nu,+ |0i|m\u2212 i1 |m\u2212 i2 |m\u2212 i3 }.\n\nIf the photon detector at the right lower output port Dl\nfires, the state of the system collapse into:\n1\n\u221a (\u2212\u03b1|m+ i1 |m\u2212 i2 |m\u2212 i3\n2 2\n+ \u03b2|m\u2212 i1 |m+ i2 |m+ i3 ).\n\n|\u03a8i123 =\n\n(8)\n\nThen Alice will measure the ions 1, 2 in the basis:\n1\n|+i = \u221a (|m+ i + |m\u2212 i),\n2\n\n(9a)\n\n1\n|\u2212i = \u221a (|m+ i \u2212 |m\u2212 i).\n2\n\n(9b)\n\nFor the results |+i1 |+i2 , |\u2212i1 |\u2212i2 , the ion 3 will be left\nin the state \u2212\u03b1|m\u2212 i3 + \u03b2|m+ i3 , so a \u03c3y operation is\nneeded to transfer the state of ion 3 to the state of ion\n1. For the results |+i1 |\u2212i2 , |\u2212i1 |+i2 , the ion 3 will be\nleft in the state \u03b1|m\u2212 i3 + \u03b2|m+ i3 , so a \u03c3x operation\nis needed to transfer the state of ion 3 to the state of\nion 1. The total success probability of the teleportation\nscheme is 1/8. Although the successful probability is\nsmaller than 1.0, the current scheme does not need the\njoint Bell-state measurement and the complex ion trap\ntechniques, which will simplify the implementation of the\nscheme. The current scheme for the teleporation of one\nqubit unknown state can be generalized to the multiqubit unknown state case in a straight forward way. This\nwill be discussed in more detail in other papers.\nIII.\n\nENTANGLEMENT CONCENTRATION FOR\nIONIC ENTANGLED STATE VIA\nENTANGLEMENT SWAPPING\n\nSuppose there are three spatially separate users Alice,\nBob and Cliff. Alice and Bob all share a pair of nonmaximally entangled ions with Cliff. Alice has access to ion\n1, Bob has access to ion 4, and ions 2 and 3 are all at\nCliff's location. The entangled state of ions 1, 2 and the\nentangled state of ions 3, 4 are:\n|\u03a6i12 = \u03b1|m+ i1 |m+ i2 + \u03b2|m\u2212 i1 |m\u2212 i2 ,\n\n(10a)\n\n|\u03a6i34 = a|m+ i3 |m+ i4 + b|m\u2212 i3 |m\u2212 i4 .\n\n(10b)\n\nWhere \u03b1, \u03b2, a, b are normalization coefficients, and |\u03b1|2 +\n|\u03b2|2 = 1, |a|2 + |b|2 = 1. Without loss of generality, we\ncan assume that \u03b1, \u03b2, a, b are all real numbers.\nBefore swapping, the state of the total system is:\n|\u03a6itotal = a+\nl,+ |0i(\u03b1a|m+ i1 |m+ i2 |m+ i3 |m+ i4\n+ \u03b1b|m+ i1 |m+ i2 |m\u2212 i3 |m\u2212 i4\n+ \u03b2a|m\u2212 i1 |m\u2212 i2 |m+ i3 |m+ i4\n+ \u03b2b|m\u2212 i1 |m\u2212 i2 |m\u2212 i3 |m\u2212 i4 ).\n\n(11)\n\n\f4\nTo construct entanglement between ion 1 and ion 4, Cliff\nwill introduce the MZI as in section II, and put the ions\n2, 3 on the upper and lower arm of the MZI, respectively.\nThen One \u03c3 + polarized photon will be superimposed on\nthe MZI from the left lower input port. From the evolution in Eq.(6), we can give the evolution caused by the\nMZI:\n\u2032\n1\n|\u03a8itotal = \u03b1a \u221a (|Si2 |gi2 |m+ i3\n2\n\n1\n+ i|m+ i2 |Si3 |gi3 )|m+ i1 |m+ i4 + \u03b1b[ \u221a |Si2 |gi2 |m\u2212 i3\n2\ni +\n+\n+ (au,+ + ial,+ )|0i|m+ i2 |m\u2212 i3 ]|m+ i1 |m\u2212 i4\n2\ni\n+ \u03b2a[ \u221a |m\u2212 i2 |Si3 |gi3\n2\n1 +\n+ (al,+ + ia+\nu,+ )|0i|m\u2212 i2 |m+ i3 ]|m\u2212 i1 |m+ i4\n2\n+ i\u03b2ba+\n(12)\nu,+ |0i|m\u2212 i2 |m\u2212 i3 |m\u2212 i1 |m\u2212 i4 .\nThen Cliff will detect the two output ports of the MZI.\nIf the photon detector at the right lower output port Dl\nfires, the state of the total system will collapse into:\n1\n(\u2212\u03b1b|m+ i1 |m+ i2 |m\u2212 i3 |m\u2212 i4\n2\n+ \u03b2a|m\u2212 i1 |m\u2212 i2 |m+ i3 |m+ i4 ).\n\n|\u03a6i1234 =\n\n(13)\n\nIf we let \u03b1 = a \u03b2 = b, the state in Eq.(13) becomes:\n1\nab(|m\u2212 i1 |m\u2212 i2 |m+ i3 |m+ i4\n2\n\u2212 |m+ i1 |m+ i2 |m\u2212 i3 |m\u2212 i4 ),\n\n|\u03a6i1234 =\n\n(14)\n\nwhich is a four-ion maximally entangled states. If Cliff\nmeasures the ions 2, 3 in the |\u00b1i basis as in section II,\nthe ions 1, 4 will be left in maximally entangled state\n\u221a1 (|m\u2212 i1 |m+ i4 \u2212 |m+ i1 |m\u2212 i4 ) for the results |+i2 |+i3 ,\n2\n|\u2212i2 |\u2212i3 . If the results are |+i2 |\u2212i3 , |\u2212i2 |+i3 , the\nions 1, 4 will be left in the maximally entangled state\n\u221a1 (|m\u2212 i1 |m+ i4 + |m+ i1 |m\u2212 i4 ). The total success prob2\nability is 21 |a|2 (1 \u2212 |a|2 ).\nSo the two ions 1, 4, which have never interacted before, are left in an entangled state via entanglement swapping. Furthermore, the initial nonmaximally entangled\nstates in Eq.(10) have been concentrated into a maximally entangled state via entanglement swapping [18]. In\nour previous contributions [13, 14], we also realized the\nentanglement concentration via entanglement swapping\nin cavity QED, and the success probabilities of them are\nbigger than that of the current scheme. But, the current\nscheme uses the linear optical elements, which can be realized within the current technology easily. In addition,\nfour-ion maximally entangled states can be generated in\nthe current scheme. In one of our previous contributions, we used the similar setup, and realized the purification and concentration of nonmaximally entangled\nionic states [15]. But two MZIs have been used there. In\n\nour current scheme, the concentration can be realized by\nusing the MZI only once. So the current scheme is more\nefficient than the previous one.\nIV.\n\nREMOTE PREPARATION OF ENTANGLED\nSTATES\n\nIn section III, if Cliff want to prepare an entangled\nstate:\n|\u03a6i14 = m|m+ i1 |m\u2212 i4 + n|m\u2212 i1 |m+ i4 ,\n\n(15)\n\non ions 1, 4 remotely, Cliff will \u2032measure the state of ions\n2, 3 in Eq. (14) in the basis |\u00b1 i:\n\u2032\n\n|+ i = \u03bd|m+ i + \u03bc|m\u2212 i,\n\n(16a)\n\n\u2032\n\n|\u2212 i = \u2212\u03bc|m+ i + \u03bd|m\u2212 i.\n\u03bd2\n,\n\u03bd 4 +\u03bc4\n\nWhere m = \u221a\n\n\u03bc2\n.\n\u03bd 4 +\u03bc4\n\nn= \u221a\n\n(16b)\n\nAfter the measure-\n\nment, the ions 1, 4 will be left in different states corresponding\nto different\nmeasurement results. For results\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n|+ i2 |+ i3 , |\u2212 i2 |\u2212 i3 , ions 1, 4 will be left in maximally\nentangled state \u221a12 (|m\u2212 i1 |m+ i4 \u2212 |m+ i1 |m\u2212 i4 ) with\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nprobability 21 |\u03bc|2 |\u03bd|2 |a|2 |b|2 . For the result |+ i2 |\u2212 i3 ,\nions 1, 4 will be left in the state in Eq.(15), i.e. the\nstate Cliff want to prepare remotely. The probabil\u2032\n\u2032\nity is 14 |a|2 |b|2 (|\u03bc|4 + |\u03bd|4 ). For the results |\u2212 i2 |+ i3 ,\nions 1, 4 will be left in the state 21 ab(\u03bc2 |m+ i1 |m\u2212 i4 +\n\u03bd 2 |m\u2212 i1 |m+ i4 ) with probability 41 |a|2 |b|2 (|\u03bc|4 + |\u03bd|4 ).\nThis state can be converted into the state in Eq.(15) by\noperating \u03c3x operations on\u2032 the \u2032two ions.\nSo\nif ions 2,\n\u2032\n\u2032\n3 are measured in states |+ i2 |\u2212 i3 , |\u2212 i2 |+ i3 , the ions\n1, 4 will be prepared in the state in Eq.(15) successfully\nwith probability 21 |a|2 |b|2 (|\u03bc|4 + |\u03bd|4 ).\nCompared with the previous scheme for the remote\npreparation of entangled states, the current scheme embeds the following advantages: (1) it does not need the\njoint measurement; (2) it can realize the remote preparation of entangled state for ions by using linear optical\nelements. So it is simpler than the cavity QED or iontrap schemes.\nBy far we have only discussed the idea case where we\nsuppose that a photon impinging on an atom always leads\nto the process described in Eq.(1). But in most case the\nphoton will not be scattered by the ions, if the ions are\nplaced inside the MZI. That would mean that detector\nat the right upper output port Du will most likely fire.\nTo enhance the scattering rate, an optical cavity will be\nadded to enclose the MZI. The detailed description has\nbeen discussed in Ref. [19], which indicates that this cavity will increase the success probability.\nThen we will consider the feasibility of the current\nscheme. As discussed in Refs. [15, 20], we can use 40 Ca+\nas the candidate ion for a possible implementation of the\n\n\f5\ncurrent scheme. D5/2 and D3/2 are two metastable levels\nof 40 Ca+ with lifetimes of the order of 1s. s1 and s2 are\ntwo sublevels of D5/2 with m = \u22125/2 and m = \u22121/2,\nand this two sublevels are coupled to |ei by \u03c3\u2212 and\n\u03c3+ light at 854nm. Here e, S1 , S2 , S1/2 correspond to\ne, m\u2212 , m+ , g in Fig.1 respectively. That is to say, we use\nthe S1/2 as stable ground state, S1 , S2 as two degenerate\nmetastable state and P3/2 as excited state. Arbitrary superposition state of this two degenerate metastable states\ncan be realized by applying a laser pulse of appropriate\nlength, which can be realized in a few microsecond [21].\nThe 40 Ca+ in state S1 or S2 can be excited into the\nexcited state P3/2 by applying one \u03c3\u2212 or \u03c3+ light at\n854nm. Then decay from |ei to S1 , S2 , to D3/2 and to\nS1/2 are all possible. But Refs. [20, 22] give the transition probability for P1/2 \u2192 S1/2 (397nm) as 1.3 \u00d7 108 /s\nand the branching ratio of P1/2 \u2192 D3/2 (866nm) versus\nP1/2 \u2192 S1/2 (397nm) as 1:15, while the branching ratio\nfor P3/2 \u2192 D5/2 (854nm) versus P3/2 \u2192 S1/2 (393nm)\ncan be estimated as 1:30, giving 0.5 \u00d7 107 /s for the transition probability. So in most case, the 40 Ca+ in the excited state will decay into the stable ground state S1/2 .\nThe detection of the internal states of 40 Ca+ can be realized by using a cycling transition between S1/2 and\nP1/2 (397nm) [22, 23].\nTo enhance the emission efficiency of the photons from\nthe ions, we can introduce cavities. Then the following\nthree items will affect the emission efficiency of the photon from the ions:\n\u2022 The coupling between cavity mode and the P3/2 \u2192\nS1/2 (393nm) transition;\n\u2022 Decay from P3/2 to D5/2 ;\n\u2022 Cavity decay.\nFrom reference [24], the probability pcav for a photon\nto be emitted into the cavity mode after excitation to\n4\u03b3\u03a92\ne can be expressed as pcav = (\u03b3+\u0393)(\u03b3\u0393+4\u03a9\nwhere\n2) .\n\u03b3 = 4\u03c0c/Fcav L is the decayqrate of the cavity, Fcav its\n\nswapping as example), we must consider the following\nitems:\n\u2022 The emission efficiency of photon: pcav , which has\nincluded the cavity decay; To maximize the pcav ,\nwe have chosen Fcav = 19000, L = 3mm. Then\n\u03b3 = 9.9 \u00d7 106 /s, pcav = 0.01 [20];\n\u2022 The effect of the photon detectors is expressed as\n\u03b7.Here we let a detection efficiency \u03b7 = 0.7, which\nis a level that can be reached within the current\ntechnology.\n\u2022 Coupling the photon out of the cavity will introduce another error expressed as \u03be, which can be\nmodulated to be close to unit.\nIn addition, we suppose Alice and Bob all have shared\nan ensemble of nonmaximally entangled pairs of ions\nwith Cliff. After considering the above factors, the total success probability can be expressed as follow: P =\na2 (1\u2212a2 )\n\u00d7pcav 2 \u00d7\u03b7\u00d7\u03be for the entanglement concentration\n2\nvia swapping, that is to say, if we input photon with the\nrate of 1000000/s, we can get eight pairs of concentrated\nentangled 40 Ca+ ions per second for a2 = 0.7.\nIn conclusion, we proposed a linear optical scheme for\nthe teleportation of unknown ionic states, the entanglement concentration for nonmaximally entangled ionic\nstates via entanglement swapping and the remote preparation of entangled states for ions that have never interacted before. The current scheme does not need the\nrealization of the complex joint measurement, i.e. the\njoint measurement has been converted into the separate\nmeasurements on single photons or ions. Quantum information processing for ions can be realized by using\nlinear optical elements. In addition, the scheme avoids\nthe complexity of the ion-trap schemes. However, the\ncurrent scheme can not realize the quantum dense coding, because the current scheme can not discriminate the\nfour Bell states conclusively.\n\nhc\nfinesse, L its length, \u03a9 = D\nh\u0304\n2\u01eb0 \u03bbV is the coupling constant between the transition and the cavity mode, D the\ndipole element, \u03bb the wavelength of the transition, V\n2\nthe mode volume (which can be made\np as small as L \u03bb/4\nfor a confocal cavity with waist L\u03bb/\u03c0), and \u0393 is the\nnon-cavity related loss rate [20].

[20], the photon package is about 100ns, which is a\nrelative long time for the current scheme to be completed.\nWhen calculating the total efficiency of the current\nscheme (we discuss the entanglement concentration via\n\nThis work is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of the Education Department of Anhui Province\nunder Grant No: 2004kj005zd and Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation under Grant No: 03042401 and\nthe Talent Foundation of Anhui University.\n\n[1] C.
