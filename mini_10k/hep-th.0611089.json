H. Lavenda\u2217\nUniversit\u00e0 degli Studi, Camerino 62032 (MC) Italy\n\nAbstract\nIt is shown that what is commonly referred to as the MIT 'bag' model of hadrons is ther-\n\narXiv:hep-th/0611089v1 8 Nov 2006\n\nmodynamically wrong: The adiabatic conditions between pressure and temperature, and between\npressure and volume imply the third, an adiabatic relation between temperature and volume. Consequently, the bag model is destitute of any predictive power since it reduces to a single adiabatic\nstate. The virial theorems proposed by the MIT group are shown to be the result of the normal\npower density of states of a non-degenerate gas and not the exponential density of states of the\nHagedorn mass spectrum. A number of other elementary misconceptions and inaccuracies are also\npointed out.\n\nPACS numbers: 12.39.Ba; 12.38.Lg; 12.40.Aa\n\n1\n\n\fThe MIT bag model1 assumes that there is a region of space which contains hadronic\nfields which are acted upon by a constant, positive potential energy, B, per unit volume.\nThis region of space is referred to as a 'bag'. The constant B of the bag is the maximum\nexternal pressure corresponding to the maximum temperature of the bag, or what is usually\nreferred to as the 'Hagedorn' temperature.\nAccepting these statements at face value, it follows that the internal energy of the gas\nand the volume which it occupies are at the same limit. Hence, the analogy with a first\norder phase transition in which the heat communicated to the system to change its volume,\nat constant temperature, so as to leave its vapor pressure unchanged is unfounded, because\nthere can be no change in the volume in that limit. Using the method of characteristics\nwe will give a proof that two adiabatic conditions implies the third. Moreover, we give\na complete characterization of the photon gas on an adiabat which is not possible on an\nisotherm when the independent variables are chosen to be temperature and pressure. It is\nquite remarkable that the three infinite terms in the calorimetric equation, when pressure\nand temperature are chosen as independent variables, involving the heat capacity at constant\npressure, the isothermal compressibility, and the coefficient of thermal expansion, exactly\ncancel one another on an adiabat. Finally, we show that their virial expressions follow from\na normal power law density of states and not the exponential Hagedorn mass spectrum,\nwhich they claim incorrectly to have derived from the thermodynamic formalism.\nWhat the authors refer to as the total energy, E, in the first law\nE = Er + BV = 4BV = H,\n\n(1)\n\nis actually the enthalpy. Er is the 'radiation', or internal, energy of the gas,\nEr = \u03c3T 4 V,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the radiation constant, appears as the usual Stefan relation, but isn't because\nthe temperature is held fixed at variable volume. We will now show that a consequence is\nthat, in fact, the volume is also constant.\nAccording to the second law, the increase in heat, as a function of enthalpy and pressure,\nis\ndQ = T dS = dH \u2212 V dp.\n\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\fDue to the two phase nature of photons, the pressure is a function of temperature independent of the volume except on the adiabats. This is reflected in the fact certain thermodynamic quantities are infinite. If both temperature and pressure are kept constant, as\nthey are in the bag model, Q = H = const. Adiabaticity must be remain true for whatever\nindependent variables are chosen. Consequently, their second law\ndS =\n\n\u0001\ndQ\n= 43 \u03c3d V T 3 = 0,\nT\n\n(4)\n\nwhich in terms of their constant pressure B states that\nB 3/4 V0 = const.,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere V0 is supposedly the \"volume containing one quantum particle.\" Rather, the volume\nhas been shown to be constant, and equal to V0 . This is the only volume that the 'bag'\nknows.\nWe can reverse the argument: If (5) holds, and since BT \u22124 = const., it follows that\nT V 1/3 = const.,\nwhere\nT = T0 =\n\n\u0012\n\n(6)\n\n\u00131/4\n\n3B\n\u03c3\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\nand V = V0 . As Clerk Maxwell rightly asserted2 : The thermal properties of a substance can\nonly be defined completely when it is specified on both isotherms and adiabats. It is the\nadiabat (6) that destroys the bag model.\nWe now offer the general proof that any two adiabatic relations implies the third. If T\nand p are chosen as independent variables in (3), comparing coefficients of dp on both sides\nof the equation gives\nT\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202S\n\u2202p\n\n\u0013\n\n=\nT\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212 V.\n\n\u0013\n\n= \u22123V.\n\n\u2202H\n\u2202p\n\nT\n\nIntroduce the Maxwell relation, \u2212(\u2202V /\u2202T )p = (\u2202S/\u2202p)T , and use H = 4pV , the third\nequality in (1). I then obtain\nT\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202V\n\u2202T\n\n\u0013\n\n+ 4p\n\np\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202V\n\u2202p\n\n(8)\n\nT\n\nThis partial de can be solved by the method of characteristics. The concept behind this\nis to identify paths in the (T, p) plane, called characteristics, along which (8) reduces to an\n3\n\n\fordinary de, which is much easier to solve. The auxiliary system of ordinary de, derived by\nLagrange, is\ndp\ndT\ndV\n=\n=\u2212 .\n4p\nT\n3V\n\n(9)\n\n\u03a6(u, v) = 0,\n\n(10)\n\nThen the general solution to (8) is\n\nwhere \u03a6 is an arbitrary function, and\nu = p1/4 /T = a\n\nand\n\nv = p3/4 V = b\n\n(11)\n\nare two independent solutions to (9), and a and b are arbitrary constants. At least one of\nthese two independent solutions must contain the dependent variable, V . The remaining\nrelation, T V 1/3 = c, which is (6), is obtained from (11) by eliminating p between them, or\ndirectly by integrating (9).\nAlternatively, the general solution (10) may be written as\n\u0001\np = T 4\u03c6 T 3V ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is another arbitrary function. The equation of state spans the entire range, from a\nphoton gas, where \u03c6 = const., to an ideal gas where it is the inverse function.\nThe characteristics (11) are none other than adiabats defined by dQ = 0. We begin with\nthe fundamental calorimetric equation\ndQ = L dV + Cv dT,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere L = \u03b5 + p is the latent heat, \u03b5 being the energy density, and Cv is the heat capacity\nat constant volume. Transforming from the independent variables V, T to p, T , I get\ndQ = \u2212LV \u03baT dp + Cp dT\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b12 V T\n\u03b12 V T\ndp + Cv +\ndT\n= \u2212LV \u03baS +\nCp\n\u03baT\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03baT,S = \u2212(1/V )(\u2202V /\u2202p)T,S are the isothermal and adiabatic compressibilities, respectively, and \u03b1 = (1/V )(\u2202V /\u2202T )P is the coefficient of thermal expansion. Expression (14)\ncontains three infinite terms, \u03b1, \u03baT and Cp . However, on an adiabat, a photon gas is not\ninfinitely compressible. It is remarkable that the infinities cancel along an adiabat.\n\n4\n\n\fThe derivative of the pressure with respect to the temperature at constant volume and\nconstant entropy are\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u2202p\n\u2202p\nCv\n=\n\u2212\n\u2202T\n\u2202T\n\u03b1V T\n\u0012 \u0013V \u0012 \u0013 S\n\u2202p\n3\n\u2202p\n=\n+\n.\n\u2202T S\n\u2202T V\n\u03baT T\n\n(15a)\n(15b)\n\nIntroducing the latter into the former gives\nCv\n\u03b1\n=\n\u03baT\n3V\n\nand\n\n\u03b1\n\u03baS\n=\n,\nCp\n3V\n\n(16)\n\nwhere the second equality follows from the well-known relation \u03baT /Cp = \u03baS /Cv . Because \u03b1\nand \u03baT are infinite for a photon gas mean that the partial derivatives in (15a) and (15b) are\nequal, as can be seen by introducing (16) into (14). Setting it equal to zero I obtain\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\nCv (1 + 31 \u03b1T )\n\u2202p\np\n\u2202p\nCv\n=\n=4 =\n,\n=\n1\n\u2202T S LV \u03baS (1 + 3 \u03b1T )\nLV \u03baS\nT\n\u2202T V\n\n(17)\n\nshowing that the infinities in (14) cancel one another along an adiabat which is also an\nisochore, because the pressure is independent of the volume, and the adiabatic condition\nbetween pressure and temperature given in (11). However, this does not mean that S =\nconst. is equivalent to V = const., as the bag model implies because the temperature is\nheld constant. The adiabatic condition between temperature and pressure is given by (6),\nand any two adiabatic conditions implies the third. The two adiabatic conditions given by\nthe bag model, Eqn (2.8) or (7), and the equation following (2.8), equivalent to (5), imply\nT03 V0 = const., and there is no other volume V .\nBecause the pressure is fixed, independent of variations in the volume, the analogy with a\nfirst order phase transition is illusory. When two phases are present, changes in the volume\nat constant temperature will make the liquid condense or evaporate so as to leave the vapor\npressure unchanged. The Carnot-Clapeyron equations are3\n\u0012 \u0013\nL\nsCv\n\u2202p\n= =\n,\n\u2202T S T\nV\n\n(18)\n\nwhere s is the Gr\u00fcneisen parameter, which for a photon gas equals 31 . Introducing (18) into\nthe fundamental calorimetric equation, (13), yields\ndQ = Cv T d ln (V s T ) = 0,\n5\n\n\fand no heat is communicated to the photon gas on an adiabat as a result of (6).\nIn the MIT bag model B is a pure constant independent of the state of the system.\nThrough the absorption of heat at constant temperature work can be performed; but, as we\nknow from Carnot, two different temperatures are required. In the bag model there is only\na single temperature, T0 , and neither work can be performed nor heat absorbed. Variations\nin the volume at constant pressure and temperature are therefore completely illusory.\nTurning to their variational principle in which the entropy\nS(Er , V ) =\n=\n\n1/4\n4 1/3\n3 Er (\u03c3V )\n4\n3 (E\n\n\u2212 BV )3/4 (\u03c3V )1/4 + S0\n\n(19)\n\nis to be maximized with respect to V keeping E fixed, we note: (1) From the condition that\nthe temperature is held constant, the first equation says that the entropy is linear in the\nvolume. (2) E is really the enthalpy H in the second equation, whose differential is\ndH = T dS + V dp,\n\n(20)\n\nso that if p = B, the constancy of H demands that the entropy be constant. Consequently,\nthere is no variational principle.\nThe adiabatic conditions, (6) and (11), are preserved even when the bag is in motion at a\nuniform velocity, v = c\u03b2. This is a consequence of the fact that, out of all the thermodynamic\npotentials, H is the only first order homogeneous function of the FitzGerald contraction,\np\n\u03b3 \u22121 = 1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 , viz.,\ndH\nH = \u22121 \u03b3 \u22121 ,\n(21)\nd\u03b3\nwhere the total derivative can be used since the other independent variables, S and p, are\nLorentz invariant. According to (20), (21) implies that \u03b3T and \u03b3V are also Lorentz invariant.\nConsequently, in a state of uniform motion the adiabatic conditions, (6) and (11), become5 :\n\u03b3 4/3 T V 1/3 = const.,\n\np1/4 /\u03b3T = const.,\n\nand\n\np3/4 \u03b3V = const.\n\nThe temperature T0 is not \"equivalent to the average kinetic energy of the partons\"1\nbecause the average number of partons varies as the cube of the temperature. It is wellknown that thermal equations of state, where the energy is proportional to the power of the\ntemperature, allow for additional degrees of freedom other than translational, e.g. creation\n6\n\n\fand annihilation of particles. Their equation for the average number of partons, (2.8),\nN=\n\nEr\nB\n= 3 V = V /V0 ,\nT0\nT0\n\n(22)\n\nwhere\nV0 = (3B)\u22123/4 \u03c3 1/4 ,\nis the second adiabatic condition in (11), gives the impression that the average number of\npartons can be varied merely by varying the volume V . Rather, the average number of\npartons, for a fixed volume, varies as the cube of the absolute temperature.\nMoreover, any pressure that is constant, independent of the variables necessary to specify\nthe thermodynamic state, will lead to inconsistencies when these variables are varied in a\nchange from one thermodynamic state to another. This remark also pertains to the Poincar\u00e9\n'hydrostatic\" pressure in which he needed to add on to the electrostatic mass, mes , in order\nto convert it into the electromagnetic mass mem , viz., 43 mes = mem .\nTheir virial theorem, Eqn (2.12), is exactly that of a perfect nondegenerate gas, and has\nnothing whatsoever to do with a density of states given by\n\u03b6 = \u03b60 eS = \u03b60 eH/T0\n\n(23)\n\nwhere \u03b60 is a constant. The density of states (23) is simply a consequence of the fact that\nthe entropy of degenerate systems does not have the logarithmic form that a normal, power\ndensity of states has. Rather, (23) is an asymptotic limit in which Cocconi's assumption,\nthat both the internal energy and particle number diverge in such a way that their ratio\nremains finite, is satisfied.4\nWe may rewrite their Eqn (2.12) in terms of kinetic theory as\n*\n+\n2\nN\n\u03b2\np\n.\nB = 31 mc2\nV\n1 \u2212 \u03b22\n\n(24)\n\nNow, introducing their relation (2.8), or my (22), into (24) results in\n*\n+\n\u03b22\nT0\n= p\n,\nmc2\n1 \u2212 \u03b22\n\nwhere their definition of the maximum temperature, (7), has been used. Evaluating the\naverage using the Maxwell-Juttner distribution7 for a nondegenerate perfect gas for which\nthe number of particles in the range \u03b8 to \u03b8 + d\u03b8 is\nN(\u03b8) d\u03b8 =\n\nV \u2212(mc2 /T0 ) cosh \u03b8\ne\nsinh2 \u03b8 cosh \u03b8 d\u03b8,\n\u03c0 2 \u03bb3C\n7\n\n(25)\n\n\fwhere \u03b8 is the rapidity, defined by\n\u03b8 = tanh\u22121 \u03b2,\nand \u03bbC is the Compton wavelength. Performing the average gives 3BV0 = T0 , or their Eqn\n(2.8). This clearly shows that the Maxwell-Juttner distribution (25) reproduces their results,\nand is completely extraneous to the Hagedorn mass spectrum (23).\nEven more can be said when we consider the average of the pressure\nZ \u221e\nmc2\n2\nB = 2 3\ne\u2212(mc /T0 ) cosh \u03b8 sinh4 \u03b8 d\u03b8\n\u03c0 \u03bbC 0\nmc2 K2 (x)\n,\n= 2 3\n\u03c0 \u03bbC x2\n\n(26)\n\nwhere K2 (x) is a Bessel function of order 2, and x = mc2 /T0 . In the high and low temperature limits\nB\u223c\nand\n\n2 T04\n\u03c0 2 (h\u0304c)3\n\n5/2\n\n(27)\n\n2\n\n2T\ne\u2212mc /T0\nB \u223c 03\n,\n\u03bbC (2\u03c0mc2 )3/2\n\n(28)\n\nrespectively. In the high temperature limit, (27) gives the pressure of an ultrarelativistic gas,\nwhile in the low temperature limit, (28) is the pressure of a degenerate boson gas. B can\nhardly be considered as a constant external pressure when T0 varies from the nonrelativistic\nto the ultrarelativistic limits. Consequently, T0 can hardly be considered as a limiting\ntemperature.\n\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: bernard.lavenda@unicam.it\n\n1\n\nA. Chodos, R. L. Jaffe, K. Johnson, C. B. Thorn, and V. F.

Planck, Ann. d. Phys. 26 (1908) 1. Planck introduces his kinetic potential K = pV , and\ndefines the momentum as cG = (\u2202K/\u2202\u03b2)T,V . Apart from the sign, this is clearly incorrect and\n\n8\n\n\fcan be traced back to his first law for the increase in the internal energy:\ndE = c\u03b2 dG \u2212 p dV + T dS.\nSince K is a Legendre transform, it will have the term cG d\u03b2. However, E is not the internal\nenergy, but, rather, the total energy6\nE = Er + c\u03b2G,\n\n(29)\n\nsince\np\nEr\u2032 + \u03b2 2 pV \u2032 \u03b2 2 (Er\u2032 + pV \u2032 )\nE \u2212 vG = p\n\u2212 p\n= Er\u2032 1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 = Er = T S \u2212 p V,\n1 \u2212 \u03b22\n1 \u2212 \u03b22\n\nwhere the prime refers to the inertial frame at rest. The second term in (29) is the work required\nto keep the system in an inertial state travelling at a constant velocity, c\u03b2. The confusion of the\ntwo leads Planck to the definition of momentum as cG = \u03b3\u03b2pV \u2032 , which contradicts his correct\ndefinition of the momentum\ncG = \u03b3\u03b2H \u2032 .\nThis is the second, but not the first equality, in his Eqn (46).

Consequently, there is no way of introducing the\nFitzGerald contraction factor, \u03b3 \u22121 , as an additional independent variable.5 Rather, it must be\nintroduced as the first order homogeneity property of the enthalpy (21), whose characteristic\nequation is\n\u03b2 d\u03b2\ndH\nd\u03b3 \u22121\n,\n=\u2212\n=\n\u03b3 \u22121\n1 \u2212 \u03b22\nH\nor\ncG = \u2212\n\ndH\n\u03b2H\n=\n= \u03b3\u03b2H \u2032 ,\nd\u03b2\n1 \u2212 \u03b22\n\n(31)\n\ninstead of the first equality in Planck's (47). The total derivative in the definition of the momentum (31) is applicable because the thermodynamic fundamental relation for the entropy is\nH = H(S, p), and S and p are Lorentz invariants, as Planck clearly shows.\n6\n\nB.
