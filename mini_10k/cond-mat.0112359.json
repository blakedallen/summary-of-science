INTRODUCTION\n\nIt is impossible to overestimate the role of the multiband effective mass approximation (MEMA), which consists of\nthe multiband k * p method together with the envelope function approximation (EFA), in the simulation of electronic\nand optical devices formed from various semiconductor heterostructures, such as those with Type-I and Type II\nheterointerfaces, quantum well structures and superlattices, and one and zero dimensional semiconductor structures\nsuch as quantum wires and quantum dots. The calculations of energy bands and wave functions in such structures\nhave often been considered as only being a matter of \"energy band engineering\" or \"wave function engineering\".\nHowever, although such calculations successfully describe many heterostructures (see, for example, Ref. 1), a general\ntheoretical description of structures with abrupt interfaces has yet to be developed.\nThe MEMA gives an accurate description of the energy band structure of bulk semiconductors near the extrema of\nthe first Brillouin zone. In this approach the carrier wave functions are expanded in the band edge Bloch functions near\nan extremum with \"envelope function\" coefficients, or components, that are required to vary slowly over a distance on\nthe scale of the unit cell a0 . The bulk MEMA Hamiltonian contains such parameters as band edge energies, interband\nmomentum matrix elements and carrier effective masses. These material parameters are determined by fitting to\nindependent experimental data or are obtained from first principles calculations. The MEMA is certainly appropriate\nfor calculating the spectrum and carrier wave functions in the presence of any slowly varying potential2 .\nHowever, abrupt heterointerfaces in semiconductor heterostructures break the periodicity of the crystal potential3,4 .\nThe nonperiodic part of the potential varies rapidly in an interface region of size a \u2248 a0 . This may lead to such interface\neffects as the admixture of remote band states3 , coupling of states with different symmetry5\u20138 , and the formation\nof surface localized states4 . Moreover, Bloch functions in dissimilar materials can be significantly different9 and do\nnot even exist in the boundary regions10. In light of the great success of the MEMA, it is important to develop an\nadequate description of semiconductor heterostructures with abrupt boundaries using the MEMA to describe each\nmaterial in the heterostructure. Laikhtman10 has shown that this is possible for heterostructures with a characteristic\nlength L \u226b a, provided that the boundaries are treated appropriately. The problem is then focused on the appropriate\nchoice of boundary conditions (BC) for piece\u2013wise defined envelope functions in these heterostructures.\nConservation of the current normal to the interface is an obvious requirement dictated by conservation of probability\ndensity. In the EFA this condition reduces to the continuity across the interface of the normal component of the\nprobability flux density J\u03c4 averaged over the unit cell3,11 . In a heterostructure formed of semiconductors with\n\n1\n\n\fparabolic bands, which can be described by a single band effective mass approximation (EMA) (the simplest MEMA),\nthis condition can be expressed as the continuity across the interface of:\nJ\u03c4 = \u2212i\n\n\u0011\n\u2032\u2217\nh\u0304 \u0010 \u2217 \u2032\nf f \u2212f f ,\n2m\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ~\u03c4 is a unit vector directed normal to the interface, m is the effective mass, f is the single band envelope function\nand the prime denotes the derivative along ~\u03c4 . The continuity of Eq. (1) is satisfied if\n\u2032\n\nfr = fl ,\n\n\u2032\n\nfr\nf\n= l ,\nmr\nml\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the indices r and l refer to a point just to the right and just to the left, respectively, of the\u2032 interface. These BC,\nexpressing the separate continuity of the envelope function and the normal envelope velocity, f /m, first suggested in\nRefs. 12,13, are referred to as \"conventional\" BC. However, the conventional BC of Eq. (2) were recognized almost\n20 years ago14 to be a special case of more general BC that conserve J\u03c4 across the interface3,10,14\u201317 :\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nfl\nfr\n\u2032\n\u2032\n,\ndet [Ttr ] = t11 t22 \u2212 t12 t21 = 1\n(3)\n= Ttr\nfl /ml\nfr /mr\nwhere the elements, tij , of the transfer matrix, Ttr , are characteristic of the interface10,3 , and, as seen from a more\ngeneral derivation of Eq. (3)16,17 , based on the requirement for the EMA Hamiltonian to be self\u2013adjoint18 , do not\ndepend on the particular states and are energy independent. For example, first principle calculations performed\nfor GaAs/Alx Ga1\u2212x As heterostructures15 show that the off diagonal elements t12 (which was shown to be always\nproportional to the small parameter a/L10 ) and t21 are negligible for this interface. In this case the BC can be written\nin the form\n\u2032\n\n\u03b1\nm\u03b1\nr f r = ml f l ,\n\n\u2032\n\nfr\nfl\n,\n\u03b1+1 =\nmr\nm\u03b1+1\nl\n\n(4)\n\nsimilar to the general BC first suggested in Ref. 19. In general the parameters \u03b1 and the off diagonal element t21\n(which may be non-zero for other heterostructures20 ) strongly effect the penetration of the wave function into the\nbarrier and the energy spectra in quantum wells (QWs). For example, this has been demonstrated in Ref. 21 by\nanalyzing the experimental data for the exciton optical spectra in narrow GaAs/AlGaAs and InGaAs/InP QWs\nusing the EMA with modified BC similar to those given by Eq. (4). However, the parabolic band approximation\nhas a very narrow range of applicability and appropriate BC for the MEMA need to be developed for describing\nexperimental data.\nFor the multiband analysis of heterostructures, a natural extension of the conventional BC of Eq. (2) is the continuity\nof each component of the N \u2013component envelope function, \u03a8, and of each component of the normal envelope velocity,\nV\u03c4 , at each interface.22\u201324 Taken together, these BC preserve the normal component of the envelope flux density, J\u03c4 ,\naveraged over a unit cell. The most general derivation of these BC, suggested by Barraff and Gershoni,24 is based\non the requirement for the MEMA Hamiltonian to be self-adjoint. A general form of the BC within the MEMA for\nthe planar heterostructures was suggested by Kisin et al.11 . Those authors start from the conservation of J\u03c4 at the\ninterface, and introduce\na transfer matrix connecting the components of the multiband envelope function, \u03a8, and its\n\u2032\nnormal derivative, \u03a8 , on each side of the heterointerface. The general consideration of the 8 \u00d7 8 band model based\non the symmetrical properties of the planar heterointerface11 has allowed us to gain important information about\nthe elements of the transfer matrices. However, the BC introduced in Ref. 11 may lead to an energy dependent\nconnection between the components of \u03a8 and V\u03c4 on the left and right sides of the heterointerface, and, therefore, do\nnot generally satisfy the requirement that the MEMA Hamiltonian be self-adjoint.\nThe MEMA that take band coupling into account have a significant theoretical problem when describing various\nsemiconductor heterostructures. The full expansion of the N -band envelope function in the N independent plane\nwave solutions of the bulk Hamiltonian corresponding to the same energy \u03b5 includes solutions with a very large wave\nvector lying outside the first Brillouin zone25,26 . Such \"wing\" (evanescent)25 or \"spurious\" (oscillatory)26 solutions\nmust be rejected in the perturbation k * p theory; in the bulk they are rejected as being unphysical solutions27\u201329 .\nHowever, their elimination from the multiband envelope function for heterostructures30,31,28,11 leads to additional\ncomplications in the analysis of the BC. For example, the continuity of all N components of this truncated envelope\nfunction can not be satisfied if the interband matrix elements of the momentum operator p\u0302 are not continuous across\nthe interface11 . The same problem remains for the alternative approach, based on modifying the MEMA Hamiltonian\nby discarding those terms responsible for the large k solutions25,26,32,33 . The use of different BC for the conduction\n2\n\n\fand valence band states (see, for example, Ref. 32) automatically results in the dependence of the BC on \u03b5, and is\njustified only if band coupling in the MEMA Hamiltonian and bands nonparabolicity can be neglected.\nIn our paper we consider the boundary condition problem within the MEMA for heterostructures with abrupt\nboundaries. We show that the most general requirement for the MEMA Hamiltonian to be self\u2013adjoint implies\ncontinuity at the interface of the normal component of the envelope flux density vector J\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2 . Here the indices \u03b1\nand \u03b2 denote, in general, two arbitrarily chosen envelope functions \u03a8\u03b1 and \u03a8\u03b2 , respectively. This allows us to\nformulate general BC using a new energy and state independent transfer matrix connecting the components of the\nenvelope functions and their normal velocities on each side of the interface. It also allows us to find a general way\nof eliminating the large\u2013k solutions because these solutions make only a small (proportional to a/L) contribution to\nthe envelope flux density. This procedure does not depend on the particular nature of the large-k solutions (which\nwe shall hereafter call spurious) and can be applied to boundaries with either finite or infinite potential barriers.\nThe elements of these transfer matrices can be considered as characteristic surface or interface parameters and are\nadditional to the bulk energy band parameters in the multiband k * p approximation.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we derive the general form of BC for the multiband envelope function,\nthat follows from the condition that the MEMA Hamiltonian be self\u2013adjoint. In Sec. III we derive a truncated form\nof general BC for slowly varying envelope functions which do not allow spurious solutions. To clarify the general\nprocedure, we first consider, in detail, the two band Kane model. Sec. IV gives analytical and numerical examples\nof the effect of the general BC on the quantum size energy levels in dots with infinite potential barriers. In Sec. V\nwe discuss our results and compare them with those of other approaches to the BC problem within the MEMA and\nother k * p theories for heterostructures .\nII. GENERAL FORM OF MULTIBAND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS IN HETEROSTRUCTURES WITH\nABRUPT BOUNDARIES\n\nLet us consider a semiconductor heterostructure made of M arbitrary shaped semiconductor layers with a characteristic length L. Single\u2013electron wave functions, \u03a6(r), in these structures are solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nwith the microscopic Hamiltonian \u0124micr containing a crystal potential. This potential is \"periodic\" inside each of the\nbulk\u2013like semiconductor layers, but it varies rapidly in the boundary regions with width a \u2248 a0 . Assuming that a/L\nis small, we neglect the exact behavior of \u03a6(r) in the boundary regions and expand \u03a6j \u2261 \u03a6(r \u2208 Rj ) in the bulk\u2013like\ninterior region Rj of the j-th layer in the Bloch functions, ujnk0j , at a critical point, k0j , of the bulk energy band\nstructure for the material in that layer:\n\u03a6j (r) =\n\nNj\nX\n\n\u03a8jn (r)ujnk0j ,\n\nj = 1, 2 . . .

The symmetry of the material and the number of bands can be different in each region.\nNj\nThe Nj component envelope function \u03a8j (r) = {\u03a8jn (r)}n=1\nis slowly varying in the bulk\u2013like region r \u2208 Rj , where it\nsatisfies the k * p Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\u0124 j (k\u0302)\u03a8j (r) = \u03b5\u03a8j (r) , r \u2208 Rj .\n\n(6)\n\nThe Nj \u00d7 Nj Hamiltonians \u0124 j are obtained after averaging of the perturbed microscopic Hamiltonian \u0124micr (p\u0302 + h\u0304k\u0302)\nover a unit cell in each bulk\u2013like region2 and includes terms up to the second order in the wave vector operator\nk\u0302 = \u2212i\u2207. The boundary regions, however, are excluded from the averaging procedure, and the parameters of the\nresulting heterostructure MEMA Hamiltonians, \u0124 j , may have abrupt jumps from one layer to another.\nIn what follows we study in details the boundary conditions imposed on the wave functions \u03a8(r) \u2261 \u03a8j (r) for r \u2208 Rj\nat the interfaces. The microscopic Hamiltonian \u0124micr acting on \u03a6(r) is a self\u2013adjoint operator18 . This is equivalent\nto the conservation of charge in the full heterostructure region \u03a9:\nZ\nd\nd3 r |\u03a6|2 = 0 .\n(7)\ndt \u03a9\nIf a/L is small, the contribution from the boundary regions can be neglected. Therefore, Eq. (7), within the accuracy\nof the MEMA, is replaced by d/dt h\u03a8, \u03a8i = 0, where \u03a8 is the corresponding envelope function satisfying the BC and\nthe inner product is now defined as\n3\n\n\fh\u03a8\u03b1 , \u03a8\u03b2 i =\n\nXZ\nj\n\nRj\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nd3 r \u03a8j\u03b1 , \u03a8j\u03b2 ,\n\nNj\n\u0010\n\u0011 X\n\u03a8j\u03b1\u2217n \u03a8j\u03b2 n .\n\u03a8j\u03b1 , \u03a8j\u03b2 =\n\n(8)\n\nn=1\n\nThis implies, in turn, that the heterostructure MEMA Hamiltonian, \u0124 \u2261 \u0124 j for r \u2208 Rj , acting on \u03a8 has to be a\nself\u2013adjoint operator. Therefore for any two arbitrarily chosen functions \u03a8\u03b1 and \u03a8\u03b2 , the condition\nE\nE D\nD\n(9)\n\u0124\u03a8\u03b1 , \u03a8\u03b2 = \u03a8\u03b1 , \u0124\u03a8\u03b2\nmust be satisfied if the same BC is imposed on \u03a8\u03b1 as well as on \u03a8\u03b2 (see, for example, Ref. 34). The MEMA\nHamiltonians \u0124 j , when defined for the ideally infinite homogenous bulk semiconductor, are self\u2013adjoint, but when\none adds the abrupt boundaries, the condition of Eq. (9) may be violated by boundary terms. The requirement for\n\u0124 to be self\u2013adjoint limits the choice of the boundary conditions that may occur, but there is an ample variety of\nBC that satisfy it. We shall see that any self\u2013adjoint MEMA Hamiltonian preserves the normal component of the\nenvelope flux density for an arbitrary state of the system.\nThe MEMA Hamiltonians for the Nj component envelope wave functions have terms of first and second order in k\u0302:\n\u0124 j = \u0108 j + h\u0304B\u0302j\u03bc k\u0302\u03bc + h\u03042 D\u0302\u03bcj \u03bd k\u0302\u03bc k\u0302\u03bd ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u0108 j , each B\u0302\u03bcj (\u03bc = x, y, z) and D\u0302\u03bcj \u03bd (\u03bc , \u03bd = x, y, z) are Hermitian Nj \u00d7Nj tensors of rank 0,1, and 2, respectively.\nThey contain the energy band parameters for the material in Rj and are defined only in these bulk\u2013like regions. Using\nEq.

(6), defined in each bulk\u2013like region, with energies \u03b5\u03b1 and \u03b5\u03b2 respectively. Noting that\ndivJ\u03b1 \u03b2 (r) = \u2212\n\nih\n(k\u0302\u03a8\u03b1 , V\u0302\u03a8\u03b2 ) \u2212 (\u03a8\u03b1 , k\u0302V\u0302\u03a8\u03b2 )\u2212\n2\ni\n\n(V\u0302\u03a8\u03b1 , k\u0302\u03a8\u03b2 ) + (k\u0302V\u0302\u03a8\u03b1 , \u03a8\u03b2 ) ,\n\nr \u2208 Rj ,\n\nand using Eqs.

(14) holds for arbitrary surface shape, we find\nthat local continuity of the normal envelope flux density matrix across each interface must hold:\nJ\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b2 = ~\u03c4 * J\u03b1 \u03b2 =\n\n\u0011i\n\u0011 \u0010\n1 h\u0010\n\u03a8\u03b1 , ~\u03c4 * V\u0302\u03a8\u03b2 + ~\u03c4 * V\u0302\u03a8\u03b1 , \u03a8\u03b2 = const .\n2\n\n(15)\n\nEquation (15) is a generalization of the normal flux density conservation law, J\u03c4 \u2261 J\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b1 = const, that is often used\nas the starting point for deriving BC3,11 . The condition J\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2 = const is a very general and strong requirement on\nthe envelope functions at each point of the interface. For an unpenetratable interface, or a semiconductor/vacuum\n\n4\n\n\fsurface it reduces to J\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2 = 0. We will consider this case only in Section IV, and shall assume, for now, that J\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2 6= 0\nat the semicondutor heterointerface.\nThe condition of Eq. (15) must be fulfilled independently of whether the number of the envelope function components on the two sides of interface is the same. For clarity in the following we will only consider heterostructures\nformed of semiconductors whose energy band structures are described by multiband Hamiltonians \u0124 j of same symmetry and with Nj = N in each region. For the more general case, a more complicated procedure similar to that\nsuggested in Ref. 10 is needed. The appropriate number of boundary conditions depends on the number of independent components of the envelope function \u03a8 and normal envelope velocity V\u03c4 = \u03c4 * V\u03a8. If all the components of \u03a8\nand V\u03c4 , are linearly independent on each side of the interface, the most general BC one can impose on the envelope\nfunctions are of the form:\n\u0012 \u2212 \u0013\n\u0012 + \u0013\n\u03a8\n\u03a8\n,\n(16)\n=\nT\n2N\niV\u03c4\u2212\niV\u03c4+\nwhere the indices \"-\" and \"+\" refer to neighboring points on neighboring bounding surfaces Sj and Sj+1 , respectively,\nand T2N is the 2N \u00d7 2N transfer matrix. In the BC described by Eq.(16) the material parameters of the MEMA\nHamiltonian are included in the vectors of the normal envelope velocity. Equation (15) is satisfied for all arbitrarily\nchosen \u03b1 and \u03b2 if and only if the BC of Eq. (16) are imposed on all \u03a8\u03b1 as well as on all \u03a8\u03b2 with the same T2N and\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n0 IN\n0 IN\n\u2020\n,\n(17)\nT2N =\nT2N\n\u2212IN 0\n\u2212IN 0\nwhere IN is the N \u00d7 N unit matrix and the dagger denotes the Hermitian conjugate. Therefore, T2N must be state\nindependent and characteristic only of the interface. For the conventional BC, \u03a8+ = \u03a8\u2212 , V\u03c4+ = V\u03c4\u2212 , the transfer\nmatrix reduces to the unit matrix, T2N = I2N .\nIn the \"pure\" Kane models (D\u0302\u03bc \u03bd \u2261 0 and \u0124 only contains terms linear in k\u0302) the N components of V\u03c4 = ~\u03c4 * B\u0302\u03a8\ndepend linearly on the N components of \u03a8. In this case, the general BC can be written\n\u03a8+ = TN \u03a8\u2212 ,\n\nTN\u2020 B\u03c4+ TN = B\u03c4\u2212 .\n\n(18)\n\nHere B\u03c4 = ~\u03c4 * B\u0302 and TN is an N \u00d7 N state independent transfer matrix. One can see that if B\u03c4+ 6= B\u03c4\u2212 , the transfer\nmatrix TN can not be the unit matrix IN . The number of independent equations in Eq. (18) is determined by the\nrank of the matrices B\u03c4 and can be less then N .\nThe elements of the state independent transfer matrix may depend on such properties of the heterojunction as band\noffsets and surface crystal symmetry due to, e.g., its reconstructions. Additional restrictions on the components of\nthe transfer matrix can be obtained from symmetry consideration of the bulk and surface properties11,7 in particular\ncases. For heterostructures which geometrical shape has some elements of symmetry one can expect the boundary\nparameters to be the same at the symmetrical points of the interface. For example, in a QW the parameters of the\ntransfer matrix are the same along the plane, and in the spherically shaped heterostructure, the parameters of the\ntransfer matrix are the same anywhere on the surface.\nIII. ELIMINATION OF SPURIOUS SOLUTIONS FROM MULTIBAND K * P MODEL: TRUNCATED\nBOUNDARY CONDITIONS\n\nConsider a heterostructure with a single heterointerface described by a piece-wise N \u00d7 N Hamiltonian of Eq. (10),\nand with nonzero energy dispersion matrices D\u03bc\u03bd . The envelope functions can be expanded in a complete set of N\nplane wave eigenfunctions, \u03a8i (ki ), of the N \u00d7 N MEMA Hamiltonian:\n\u03a8=\n\nN\nX\n\nCi \u03a8i (ki ) ,\n\n(19)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere the N values of ki2 are the roots of the bulk energy dispersion equation det[H(k) \u2212 \u03b5] = 0, and Ci are\nnumerical coefficients. The set of 2N boundary condition equation in Eq. (17) can be solved only if the expansion\nin Eq. (19), for both sides of the interface, includes all N of the plane wave eigenfunctions. If any, say m roots |ki |\n(i = N \u2212 m + 1 , . . . N ) lie outside the first Brillouin zone, the corresponding spurious solutions must be excluded\nfrom the wave function. In this case, 2m components of the envelope wave function and their velocities are linearly\ndependent on the other components, and only 2(N \u2212 m) independent BC can be imposed on the truncated function\n5\n\n\fPN \u2212m\n\u03a8\u0303 = i=1 Ci \u03a8i (ki ). In this section we suggest an approximate procedure which allows us to derive a truncated set\nof general BC that must be imposed on the envelope function in order to satisfy J\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b2 = const. For the sake of clarity,\nwe first consider a two band model (N = 2, m = 1) and a planar heterointerface. We then generalize it to arbitrary\nN and m and an arbitrarily shaped heterointerface.\nThe Hamiltonian of the two band Kane model is written:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n2P\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n2\nk\u0302z \uf8f7\ni\nh\u0304 \uf8ec \u03b1c k\u0302z\nEc 0\nh\u0304\n(20)\n\u0124 =\n+ \u0124K ,\n\u0124K =\n\uf8f8,\n\uf8ed\n2P\n0 Ev\n2m0\nk\u0302z \u2212\u03b1v k\u0302z2\n\u2212i\nh\u0304\nwhere k\u0302z = \u2212id/dz is the wave vector along the normal to the interface, m0 is the free electron mass, P is the Kane\ninterband matrix element, \u03b1c and \u03b1v describe the contribution of the remote bands to the electron, mc , and hole, mv ,\neffective masses respectively, and the distance between the bottom of conduction band, Ec , and the top of the valence\nband, Ev , is the energy gap Eg = Ec \u2212 Ev . The band edge effective masses can be written as m0 /mc,v = \u03b1c,v + Ep /Eg .\nHere Ep = 2P 2 /m0 is the Kane energy which also characterizes the nonparabolicity of the electron and hole bulk\nenergy spectra. Although this two band model completely neglects spin-orbit interactions, it describes the electron and\nlight hole band coupling in real semiconductors and is often used in one dimensional heterojunctions11 and spherical\ndots35,29,36 . For most semiconductors, |\u03b1c | \u223c |\u03b1v | \u223c 1 (they can be either positive or negative) and Ep \u2248 20 \u00b1 5 eV.\nIn the \"pure\" Kane model \u03b1c = \u03b1v = 0.\nFor a planar heterointerface, the general normal flux density continuity condition, Eq. (15), takes the form:\nJ\u03c4\u03a8 \u03a6 (z) =\n\n1\n[(\u03a8, V\u03a6 ) + (V\u03a8 , \u03a6)] = const ,\n2\n\n(21)\n\nwhere \u03a8 and \u03a6 are two arbitrary chosen eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (20), V\u03a8 = V\u0302z \u03a8 and V\u03a6 = V\u0302z \u03a6 are\nthe respective normal velocities calculated with the two band Kane model velocity operator V\u0302z\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nP\nk\u0302\ni\n\u03b1\nz\nc\nh\u0304 \uf8ec\nh\u0304 \uf8f7\n(22)\nV\u0302z =\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8.\nP\nm0\n\u2212\u03b1v k\u0302z\n\u2212i\nh\u0304\nThe general BC, Eqs.

The conventional BC (\u03a8r = \u03a8l and V\u03a8r = V\u03a8l ) are described by the unite transfer matrix Ttr \u2261 I4 . In the\ngeneral case, \u03b1c \u03b1v 6= 0, the BC of Eq. (23) represent 4 linear independent equations for two (conduction and valence\nband) wave function components \u03a8c , \u03a8v and two normal velocity components V\u03a8 c , V\u03a8 v . In order to solve them, the\nenvelope function of a state with energy \u03b5 is written as a linear superposition of two plane wave eigenfunctions of the\n2\nHamiltonian, Eq.(20): \u03a8 = C1 \u03a81 (k1 ) + C2 \u03a82 (k2 ), where k1,2\nare the solutions of the bulk energy dispersion equation\n\u0012\n\nh\u03042 k 2\n\u03b1c + Ecj \u2212 \u03b5\n2m0\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n\u0013\nh\u03042 k 2 j\nh\u03042 k 2\nj\n\u03b1v \u2212 Ev + \u03b5 +\nE = 0.\n2m0\n2m0 p\n\n(24)\n\nGenerally we are only interested in states whose energy is either on the order of or smaller than the semiconductor\nenergy gap. Using the condition Ep /|\u03b1c \u03b1v | \u226b Eg , |\u03b5\u2212Ec |, |\u03b5\u2212Ev |, we find for the two roots of the dispersion equation:\nh\u03042 k12 \u2248\n\n2 (\u03b5 \u2212 Ev ) (\u03b5 \u2212 Ec ) m0\n,\n(\u03b5 \u2212 Ev ) \u03b1c + (Ec \u2212 \u03b5) \u03b1v + Ep\n\nh\u03042 k22 \u2248 \u2212\n\n2Ep m0\n.\n\u03b1c \u03b1v\n\n(25)\n\nFor typical values of the bulk energy band parameters, the second wave vector |k2 | \u223c 1 \u00c5\u22121 lies beyond the first\nBrillouin zone in which the MEMA is valid. The corresponding eigenvector, \u03a82 (k2 ) is a spurious solution (either\nevanescent or propagating, depending on the sign of the product (\u03b1c \u03b1v )27 ) and must be excluded from the expansion\nof the total wave function. The continuity of the normal flux density, Eq.

The two components of the normal\nvelocities V\u03a8 c (V\u03a6 c ) and V\u03a8 v (V\u03a6 v ) are expressed through the wave function components \u03a8c (\u03a6c ) and \u03a8v (\u03a6v ). Since\nthe envelope functions \u03a8 and \u03a6 are now truncated, the normal velocity and envelope function components are no\nlonger linearly independent. Therefore, the Eq. (26) can not be fulfilled if \u03b1c \u03b1v 6= 0. (For the case \u03b1c \u03b1v = 0 the\nspurious solution k2 does not arise, and \u03a81 is then the full solution of the Hamiltonian (20)). However we shall see\nbelow that we can impose an alternative set of the state independent BC that retain the continuity of the normal flux\n\u03a8\u03a6\ndensity J\u03c4,1\nfor truncated wave functions within an accuracy consistent with the MEMA.

One can\nsee that the connection between the left and right hand side components of \u03a8c and \u03a8v has now energy dependent\ncoefficients. This is a consequence of the linear dependence of the components of the truncated wave function and its\nnormal velocity on the same side of the interface. However, the new energy independent transfer matrix T\u0303tr is still\ncharacteristic of the interface only. The truncated general BC of Eq. (28) no longer allow the simultaneous continuity\nof the both envelope function components \u03a8c (k1 ) and \u03a8v (k1 ) at the interface. For the case where the off diagonal\nmatrix elements of T\u0303tr are negligibly small, t\u030312 \u2248 t\u030321 \u2248 0, the general BC reduce to:\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\nEc \u2212 \u03b5\n\u03b5 \u2212 Ev\nP \u03b1 1 + \u03b1v\n\u03a8c = Const ,\nP 1\u2212\u03b1 1 + \u03b1c\n\u03a8v = Const ,\n(29)\nEp\nEp\nwhich is similar to the BC of Eq. (4) for heterostructures with parabolic bands.\nEquations (28, 29) are general BC for the truncated smooth wave functions in semiconductor heterostructures with\nnon-zero \u03b1c \u03b1v . These BC do not depend on the sign of \u03b1c \u03b1v (i. e., whether the spurious solution is evanescent or\npropagating). They are also valid for any Kane model with \u03b1c \u03b1v = 0, in which Eqs. (21,26) are satisfied exactly.\nThe boundary condition Eq. (29) was first discussed in Ref. 3 for the \"pure\" Kane model with \u03b1c = \u03b1v = 0; also the\nmodel with \u03b1c = 0, \u03b1v 6= 0 was considered in Ref. 33.\nTo generalize this procedure and derive general BC for truncated slowly varying envelope functions for heterostructures described by an N \u00d7 N Hamiltonian having m spurious solutions, it is important to trace from where these\nsolutions arise. Examining Eqs. (17,25) (and also see Ref. 11 which describes spurious solutions in the 8 \u00d7 8 model)\nwe find that the spurious solutions |ki | (i = N \u2212 m + 1 , . . . N ) of the dispersion equations for the Hamiltonian of Eq.\n(10) are proportional to the large components of the matrices B\u0302 and inversely proportional to the square root of the\nproduct of the tensor D\u03bc\u03bd conduction and valence band components. For the sake of definiteness37 , let us assume that\n\u2032\nthe matrices B\u0302 contain the submatrices B\u0302 = B\u0302\u03b3 /\u03b3 of rank 2m, where \u03b3 \u223c a0 /L is a dimensionless small parameter\nresponsible for the spurious solutions. For example, in the two band model considered above the normal component\nB\u03c4\u03b3 = ~\u03c4 * B\u0302\u03b3 is:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nh\u0304\na0\ni h\u0304\n0 1\n\u03b3\n, \u03b3=\n\u223c\n.\n(30)\nB\u0302\u03c4 =\n\u22121\n0\nm0 L\nPL\nL\n7\n\n\fWe can write the velocity operator of Eq.

Note that \u03a82 is absent (n = 0) in the two band model; \u03a81 is the total slowly varying envelope function\nand V1 = V\u03020 \u03a81 (V\u03020 is the diagonal part of the velocity operator in Eq. (22)). However, the functions V1 and V2 do\nnot coincide with ~\u03c4 * V\u03020 \u03a81 and ~\u03c4 * V\u03020 \u03a82 , respectively, for the general case n 6= 0.

While the elements of T2m and T2n are state independent, the function \u03a8\u03031 may be related to \u03a81 by the\nenergy dependent expression.\nThis procedure can be directly applied to heterostructures described by the 8\u00d78 Pidgeon and Brown Hamiltonian38 .\nThe bulk energy dispersion equations for this Hamiltonian has 8 solutions, ki2 , (taking spin degeneracy into account),\nfor each energy \u03b5; two of these are spurious, and proportional to the large interband Kane matrix element P (see, for\nexample, Ref. 11). In the case of zero spin\u2013orbit interaction, \u03a81 must include coupled electron and light hole band\nenvelope functions, while \u03a82 includes the heavy hole band envelope functions only. For planar heterostructures Eqs.\n(37, 38) take into account the mixing of light and heavy holes for the states with finite in-plane momentum. However\nthey neglect the effect of the \"low interface symmetry\"7 that mixes light and heavy hole plane waves normally incident\non the interface (because we assume that T12 = T21 = 0). The detailed application of our procedure to the 8 \u00d7 8\nmodels for planar and spherical heterostructures will be presented elsewhere.\n\n8\n\n\fIV. ONE DIMENSIONAL QUANTUM WELL WITH INFINITE POTENTIAL BARRIERS.\n\nLet us consider an effect of the general BC on the energy spectrum of a one dimensional quantum well having\ninfinite potential barriers. The conventional BC for structures with an impenetrable barrier require vanishing of the\nenvelope wave function at the barrier surface, but this requirement has never been justified (see for example Ref.\n39). In general, the self\u2013adjointness of the MEMA Hamiltonian requires vanishing of the normal flux density at the\nboundaries:\nJ\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2 (z = \u00b1L \u2213 0) = 0 ,\n\n(39)\n\nwhere 2L is the thickness of the quantum well. If we assume that the two interfaces are completely identical, the\nquantum well possesses reflection symmetry about z = 0 and all solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation are characterized\nby their parity according to whether their components are even or odd under reflection. However, the BC are local\ncharacteristics of each interface. Therefore, the Eq. (39) must be fulfilled at each interface independent of the\nsymmetry of the functions \u03a8\u03b1 and \u03a8\u03b2 .\nNow we consider the effect of the general BC for the case of the two band Kane model. In order to satisfy Eq. (39)\nin a quantum well with symmetric interfaces, one can write the general BC for the conduction \u03a8c and valence band\n\u03a8v components of the envelope wave function (which do not contain spurious solutions) as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b5 \u2212 Ev\n\u03b5 \u2212 Ec\n= \u2213\u0398 \u03a8v (\u00b1L \u2213 0) 1 + \u03b1c\n,\n(40)\n\u03a8c (\u00b1L \u2213 0) 1 \u2212 \u03b1v\nEp\nEp\nwhere \u0398 is a real number and the sign difference is due to the opposite parity of the conduction and valence band\ncomponents of the envelope functions. The surface parameter \u0398 does not depend on the energy or symmetry of either\nstate. Equation (40) can be derived directly from the general BC of Eq. (28) obtained in Sec. III for the case of\na finite potential barrier. To do this one has to assume that \u03a8 \u2261 0 outside the quantum well and use the state\n+\n\u2212\nindependent transfer matrices T\u0303tr\n, for z = L \u2212 0, and T\u0303tr\n, for z = \u2212L + 0 interfaces, which differ only by the sign\n+\n\u2212\n(opposite) of the offdiagonal matrix elements and satisfy the condition det[T\u0303tr\n] = det[T\u0303tr\n] = 0.\n2\n2\nNeglecting \u03b3 \u223c (a0 /L) terms, Eq. (40) can be written as two separate equations for the conduction and valence\nband components, respectively\n\u2032\nm0\n\u03a8c (\u00b1L \u2213 0) ,\nmc (Ee )\n\u2032\nm0\n\u03a8 (\u00b1L \u2213 0) ,\n\u03a8v (\u00b1L \u2213 0) = \u00b1Tv a0\nmv (Eh ) v\n\n\u03a8c (\u00b1L \u2213 0) = \u00b1Tc a0\n\nh\u0304\n,\n2P\n1 h\u0304\nT v a0 =\n.\n\u0398 2P\nT c a0 = \u0398\n\n(41)\n(42)\n\nHere the energy\u2013dependent effective masses in the conduction and valence bands are given by\nm0\nEp\n,\n= \u03b1c +\nmc (Ee )\nEe + Eg\n\nm0\nEp\n,\n= \u03b1v +\nmv (Eh )\nEh + Eg\n\n(43)\n\nwhere the electron, Ee , and hole Eh energies are measured from the bottom of conduction and the top of the valence\nbands, respectively: Ee = \u03b5 \u2212 Ec and Eh = Ev \u2212 \u03b5. The even, (+), and odd, (-), solutions to Eqs. (38,39) can be\nwritten\n+\n\u03a8+\nc(v) (z) = Ac(v) cos(\u03c6c(v) z) ,\n\n\u2212\n\u03a8\u2212\nc(v) (z) = Ac(v) sin(\u03c6c(v) z) ,\n\n(44)\n\nwhere Ac,v are the normalization constants. We can derive equations for the energies of the even and odd electron\nand hole quantum size levels:\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n2\n2\nEh\u00b1\nEe\u00b1\nm0\nh\u03042 (\u03c6\u00b1\nm0\nh\u03042 (\u03c6\u00b1\n\u00b1\nv )\nc )\n\u00b1\n1 \u2212 \u03b1v\n1 \u2212 \u03b1c\n, Eh =\n,\n(45)\nEe =\n2m0 L2 mc (Ee\u00b1 )\nEp\n2m0 L2 mv (Eh\u00b1 )\nEp\n\u00b1\nwhere \u03c6\u00b1\nc and \u03c6v are the solutions of the equations:\n\u00b1 \u00b11\n\u03c6\u00b1\n=\u2213\nc [tan(\u03c6c )]\n\nmv (Eh\u00b1 ) L\nmc (Ee\u00b1 ) L\n\u00b1 \u00b11\n, \u03c6\u00b1\n[tan(\u03c6\n)]\n=\n\u2213\n.\nv\nv\nm0 T c a 0\nm0 T v a 0\n\n(46)\n\nFigure 1 shows the dependence of the two lowest quantum size electron levels, Ee+ and Ee\u2212 , on the well width L\nas a function of of the surface parameter Tc a0 . In these calculations we use for mc the electron effective mass at the\n9\n\n\fbottom of the conduction band mc = 0.1m0 , and a band gap energy Eg = 1.7 eV which are close to the parameters of\nCdSe and CdTe. We compare the effect of the general BC on the quantum size levels in the parabolic EMA (Fig.1a),\nin the \"pure\" Kane model with \u03b1c = \u03b1v = 0 (Fig. 1b), and in the \"full\" two band model with \u03b1c \u03b1v 6= 0 (Fig.1c).\nEquations (45,46) describe the energy of the quantum size levels for coupled conduction and valence bands. However,\nthe conduction and valence band energy spectra can be considered as being independent when the energies of the\nelectron or hole levels are much less than the energy gap, |Ee |, |Eh | \u226a Eg , Ep . This limit case is realized in thick\nquantum wells and is described by the equations for the simple parabolic bands that one obtains by neglecting the\nenergy dependence of the effective masses and the Ee,h /Ep terms in Eqs. (45,46). For this case the surface parameters\nTc a0 and Tv a0 can be chosen independently, and the conventional BC \u03a8c (\u00b1L) = 0 are realized for Tc a0 = 0. Fig.\n1(a) shows the effect of Tc a0 6= 0 on the electron quantum size levels in the parabolic EMA. One sees that positive\nand negative values of Tc a0 shift the quantum size levels energy up and down, respectively, from those obtained using\nconventional BC. The effect is negligible when |Tc a0 |/L \u226a \u03c6\u00b1\nc m0 /mc but become noticeable in narrow wells and is\ngreater for higher energy levels.\nFig. 1(b) shows the effect of the general BC on the electron quantum size levels in the pure Kane model. One sees\nthat the effect of Tc a0 6= 0 is very similar to that in the parabolic EMA. The size dependence differs only in the nature\nof the nonlinear dependence on 1/L2 . This is because the Kane model takes the nonparabolicity of the conduction\nband into account.\nThe size dependence of the electron levels calculated with Tc a0 = 0 is shown in Fig. 1(b) only for comparison.\nThe conventional BC do not hold in the Kane model, because the surface parameters for coupled conduction and\nvalence bands are related by (Tc a0 )(Tv a0 ) = h\u03042 /2Ep m0 . Choosing Tc a0 = 0 for determining the electron energy levels\ncorresponds to choosing Tv a0 \u2192 \u221e, which does not describe the hole energy levels. The condition |Tc a0 | = |Tv a0 | = a\u2217\nrealized for |\u0398| = 1, describes a symmetric (relative to the to the center of the band gap) structure of the electron\nand hole quantum size levels in semiconductors with \u03b1c = \u03b1v . Although these \"symmetric semiconductor structures\"\ndo not exist in nature, the parameter a\u2217 = h\u0304/2P \u2248 0.45 \u00b1 0.06 \u00c5 gives a reasonable value of |Tc a0 | and |Tv a0 | in real\nsemiconductor structures. If symmetric BC hold\n\u03c6\u00b1\nc\n\nm0 a \u2217\n\u226a 1,\nmc (Ee ) L\n\n\u03c6\u00b1\nv\n\nm0 a \u2217\n\u226a 1,\nmv (Eh ) L\n\n(47)\n\nand the solutions of Eq. 46 for the lowest electron and hole quantum size levels, \u03c6\u00b1\nc,v , are close to those given by\nTc,v a0 = 0.\nFigure 1 (c) shows the size dependence of the electron levels calculated in the full two band model with the symmetric\nsurface parameter |T a0 | = a\u2217 = 0.43 \u00c5. One can see that the term linear in \u03b1v in Eq. (45) for the electron energy\nlevels becomes important when they comparable with the band gap energy. On the other hand changing the sign of\n\u03b1v leads only to small changes of the level energy.\nThe dependence of the lowest electron quantum size levels on the surface parameter Tc a0 for the Kane and full two\nband models for wells with L = 30 \u00c5 and L = 12 \u00c5, respectively, is shown in Fig. 2. The surface parameter is varied\nfrom \u22123.0 \u00c5 to 3.0 \u00c5 for L = 30 \u00c5, and from \u22121.2 \u00c5 to 1.2 \u00c5 for L = 12 \u00c5, respectively, so that |Tc a0 | \u2264 Lmc /m0\nis fulfilled. One can see that varying the surface parameter in this range produces a monotonic change of the first\neven and odd electron levels. The difference between models with different \u03b1c and \u03b1v (for the same mc ) is small for\nL = 30 \u00c5, but can be important for L = 12 \u00c5.\nIt is interesting to note that for positive values of the surface parameter \u0398 (Tc a0 > 0, Tv a0 > 0), equations (45,46)\nmay have even and odd solutions with an energy in the forbidden gap: Ee < 0, Eh < 0. In wide wells the energy of\n+\n\u2212\nthese gap levels do not depend on their symmetry, E(e,v),S\n= E(e,v),S\n= E(e,v),S , and can be found from\n\u0013\n\u0012\nh\u03042 mc (Ee,S )\nEe,S\n1\nEe,S = \u2212\n,\n(48)\n*\n1\n\u2212\n\u03b1\nv\n2m0\nm0\n(Tc a0 )2\nEp\n\u0013\n\u0012\nh\u03042 mv (Eh,S )\nEh,S\n1\nEh,S = \u2212\n.\n(49)\n*\n1\n\u2212\n\u03b1\nc\n2m0\nm0\n(Tv a0 )2\nEp\nIn wide \"symmetric wells\" these gap states have the same energy Ee,S = Eh,S = \u2212Eg /2, and are localized within\na layer of thickness as = 2a\u2217 Ep /Eg near the surface. These solutions contain no contributions from the unphysical\nspurious solutions, and thus are not artifacts of the k * p model.\nV. DISCUSSION AND COMPARISON WITH OTHER APPROACHES\n\nThe occurrence of discontinuities in the envelope wave functions at the heterointerface is one of the most important\nconsequence of general BC. These discontinuities have a strong effect on the mathematical procedures often used for\n10\n\n\fthe calculation of various physical properties of heterostructures having finite potential barriers. In these procedures,\nthe Sch\u00f6dinger equation is integrated across the interface or a Fourier transformation is performed using the piece\u2013\nwise spatially determined material parameters with the help of generalized step functions. However, the integration\n1 2\nk\u0302z or P k\u0302z with envelope wave functions, \u03a8, which are discontinuous across an interface\nof terms such as products of m\nmay lead to mathematical uncertainties: integration of the product of a step function and a \u03b4\u2013function is not well\ndefined. To resolve this problem, a non-unique40,30,16,17 symmetrized form of the kinetic energy operator \u0124k is used,\nand the BC for the envelope function \u03a8 are obtained by requiring that \u0124k \u03a8 be integrable across the interface40,24 .\nFor example, in order to obtain the general BC of Eq.(4) for parabolic bands, symmetrized kinetic energy operator\nof the form40\n\u03b1\n\u0124K\n=\u2212\n\n1\nd \u03b1\nh\u03042 \u03b1 d\nm\nm\n1+2\u03b1\n2\ndz m\ndz\n\n(50)\n\n1\nk\u0302z , is usually\nis used. The case \u03b1 = 0 then leads to the conventional BC of Eq. (2). The same symmetrized form, k\u0302z m\n24,30\nused for the diagonal terms of the multiband kinetic energy operator\n. To derive the BC of Eq. (29) for the \"pure\"\ntwo band Kane model (\u03b1c = \u03b1v = 0) that allow to integrate Schr\u00f6dinger equation across the interface, one writes the\nkinetic energy operator as:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nih\u0304\n0\nP \u03b1 k\u0302z P 1\u2212\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u0124K =\n.\n(51)\nm0 \u2212P 1\u2212\u03b1 k\u0302z P \u03b1\n0\n\nHere, now, there is no value of \u03b1 that gives the symmetrized form 1/2(k\u0302z P + P k\u0302z ), that is usually used for the off\ndiagonal terms (linear in k) of the multiband Hamiltonian.24,30 An asymmetric ordering, corresponding to \u03b1 = 1 was\nsuggested in Ref. 33 for the model with \u03b1c = 0. The \u03b1 dependence of Eqs. (50) and (51) clearly demonstrates that\nit is the BC that determine the integration across the abrupt heterointerface and not the other way round.\nFourier transforming the Schr\u00f6dinger equation has been suggested by Winkler and R\u00f6ssler30 as an alternative approach to the MEMA problem for heterostructures with finite potential barriers. Then one does not deal explicitly\nwith BC when solving the resulting integral equations for the momentum space envelope function, and avoids unphysical spurious solutions by restricting the range of integration to |k| \u226a 2\u03c0/a0 . However, the resulting form of the\nmomentum space MEMA Hamiltonian depends on the particular symmetrization procedure chosen for the kinetic\nenergy operator in configuration space30 , and, therefore, is again determined by the BC imposed on the envelope\nfunction. To illustrate this, we derive the explicit form of the momentum space Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the one band\nEMA and the two band \"pure\" Kane model, using general BC. Fourier integration of the EMA Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nwith the kinetic energy operator of Eq. (50) leads to the following integral equation for the momentum space envelope\nfunction F (k):\nh\u03042\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nq k M\u2212\u03b1 (k \u2212 q )M1+2\u03b1 (q \u2212 k )M\u2212\u03b1 (k \u2212 q)F (q)dq dk dq +\n\u2212\u221e\nZ \u221e\n+\nF (q)Vc (k \u2212 q)dq = \u03b5F (k) ,\n\n(52)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere F (k) satisfies the normalization condition\n1\nVc (k) =\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nR\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nEc (z) exp(\u2212ikz)dz ,\n\n|F (k)|2 dk = 1, and\n1\nM\u03bd (k) =\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n1\nexp(\u2212ikz)dz .\nm\u03bd (z)\n\n(53)\n\nHere Ec (z) and m(z) are the energy of the bottom of the conduction band and the electron effective mass in each\nregion of the one-dimensional heterostructure considered. The configuration space envelope function, in the j\u2013th\nregion of the heterostructure, is now given by\nZ \u221e\n1\nf j (z) = mj\u2212\u03b1 * \u221a\nF (q)M\u2212\u03b1 (k \u2212 q) exp(ikz)dkdq ,\n(54)\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\nand satisfies the general BC of Eq.

The configuration space envelope function \u03a8 = {\u03a8c , \u03a8v } in the j\u2013th region of the one-dimensional\nheterostructure is now given by\nZ \u221e\n1\n\u2212\u03b1\nj\n\u03a8c (z) = Pj * \u221a\nFc (q)G\u03b1 (k \u2212 q) exp(ikz)dkdq ,\n(58)\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\nZ \u221e\n1\nFv (q)G1\u2212\u03b1 (k \u2212 q) exp(ikz)dkdq ,\n(59)\n\u03a8jv (z) = Pj\u03b1\u22121 * \u221a\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\nand will satisfy the general BC of Eq. (29) with \u03b1c = \u03b1v = 0.\nGeneral BC, for heterostructures described by the MEMA Hamiltonian, that conserve the normal component of the\nenvelope flux density J\u03c4 have been suggested by Kisin et al.11 . We have shown that the general requirement that the\nheterostructure MEMA Hamiltonian be self\u2013adjoint leads to the more general condition J\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2 = const. That is, that\nJ\u03c4 must be continuous for arbitrary chosen envelope functions \u03a8\u03b1 , \u03a8\u03b2 . This generalization to \u03b1 6= \u03b2 is important,\nbecause it shows that the components of the transfer matrix connecting the components of the envelope function\n\u03a8 and envelope normal velocity V\u03c4 on the two sides of the interface, are state independent and are characteristic\nproperties of the interface,\nnot\u00a1 the states. This is not true for a transfer matrix which connects the components\nof\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03a8 and its derivatives \u03a8 (see Ref. 11), because the relationship between the components of V\u03c4 and \u03a8, \u03a8 , on the\nsame side of the interface, in the multiband model may depend on the symmetry (the value of the interface parallel\nmomentum in planar heterostructures11 and the total orbital angular momentum and parity in spherical dots36 ) or\non the energy of the state.\nAn explicit treatment of \"interface\" effects can be seen in several k * p models of heterostructures that consider\nexact electron wave functions in the interface region8,9,41\u201344 . Some of these models result in equations in addition\nto the bulk k * p equations that describe the interface43,44 . The parameters of , these \"interface\" Hamiltonians must\nbe determined from microscopic wave functions or obtained from the comparison with experiment. However, these\nadvanced models are generally much more complicated than the MEMA, completed by an appropriate choice of\nboundary conditions, which has already successfully described such interface effects as the \u0393 \u2212 X intervalley mixing\nin GaAs/AlAs heterostructures5,6 , the heavy\u2013light hole plane wave mixing at zinc blende interfaces under normal\nincidence7 and the effect on the interband light absorption of the intervalley conversion of the electron at the surface\nof indirect\u2013band\u2013gap semiconductors45 .\nHeterostructures with abrupt heterointefaces, (L \u226b a), are described by the MEMA models using energy independent transfer matrices which characterize the effects of the interfaces on the carrier wave functions within some\nenergy interval. The energy of the state considered should be within the range of validity of the chosen bulk MEMA\nHamiltonian in each layer. This means, that the energy should be smaller than the distance to the energy band extrema not explicitly included in the multiband model. In the appropriate energy interval, the elements of the transfer\nmatrices can be treated as energy independent trial parameters in fitting the experimental data.\nThe number of independent transfer matrices required to ensure the flux continuity of Eq. (15), is determined by\nthe number of physically nonequivalent interfaces of the heterostructure. Therefore, to write general BC, one must\nmodel the symmetry of the interface, i.e. the interface geometry and the symmetry of the material properties on the\ninterface. On the other hand, this is true for any explicit determination of the full microscopic wave function near\nthe interface.\nIn conclusion, we have derived a general form of state\u2013independent BC for multicomponent envelope functions that\nare valid under the same conditions as the MEMA itself. Spurious components of the wave functions are eliminated\nby requiring that the envelope flux density be determined to the same order of approximation as the MEMA itself.\nThe effect of the general BC on the electron and hole energy spectra has been demonstrated in the two band model\nfor a potential well with infinite potential barriers. This procedure, using the general BC for truncated envelope wave\nfunctions, can be applied to any MEMA model containing any type of spurious solution and to heterostructures with\nfinite or infinite potential barriers.\n12\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nA.
