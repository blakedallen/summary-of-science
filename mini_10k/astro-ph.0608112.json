It is important\n\nto establish which astrophysical sites and processes are responsible for the elemental abundance patterns of this early Galactic\npopulation.\n\n1. Introduction\nA considerable fraction (20-25%) of the very metal-poor stars\nin the Galaxy ([Fe/H] \u2264 \u22122.0) are strongly enhanced in carbon and often in nitrogen as well ([C,N/Fe] > 1.0; Beers &\nChristlieb 2005; Lucatello et al. 2006). It appears that multiple nucleosynthetic pathways for the production of C in lowmetallicity stars must be invoked, almost certainly involving\ndifferent astrophysical sites. Most stars in the range \u22122.6 \u2264\n[Fe/H] \u2264 \u22122.0 appear to be associated with C production\nin Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) companions that have\ntransferred material to the star that is now observed (Aoki et\nal. 2006a). Even lower-metallicity stars, especially those with\n[Fe/H] < \u22123.0, may contain C produced by massive, rapidlyrotating stars with [Fe/H] < \u22126.0; see, e.g., Hirschi et al.\n(2006); Karlsson et al. (2006); Piau et al. (2006). In order to\nbetter understand the role of these various possible mechanisms, detailed investigations are needed of the elemental abundances in Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars ([C/Fe]\n> +1.0; see Beers & Christlieb 2005).\nSend offprint requests to: T. Sivarani (thirupathi@pa.msu.edu)\n\u22c6\nBased on observations made with the ESO Very Large Telescope\nat Paranal Observatory, Chile (Large programme \"First Stars\", ID\n165.N-0276(A); P.I.: R. Cayrel)\n\nRecent high-resolution spectroscopic studies of CEMP\nstars selected from the two large objective-prism surveys for low-metallicity stars, the HK (Beers et al. 1985,\n1992; Beers 1999) and Hamburg-ESO surveys (Christlieb\n2003), have revealed a wide variety of elemental abundance patterns (e.g, Norris et al. 1997b,c; Bonifacio et al.\n1998; Aoki et al. 2002a,b,c; Barklem et al. 2005; Beers &\nChristlieb 2005). Many of these stars (roughly 70% - 80%;\nAoki et al. 2003, 2006a) exhibit strong s-process enhancements (CEMP-s), and are thought to be the result of AGB\nmass transfer to the presently observed companion (e.g.,\nAoki et al. 2002c; Lucatello et al. 2003; Sivarani et al. 2004;\nBarbuy et al. 2005).\nThe observed radial-velocity variations among the CEMPs stars indicate that most, if not all, could be members of binary systems (Tsangarides et al. 2004; Lucatello et al. 2005).\nEven within this group of CEMP-s stars, the observed s-process\npatterns are not identical, however. For example, the scatter\nin their observed Sr, Ba, Pb, and C abundances at a given\n[Fe/H] is large (e.g., Aoki et al. 2002c; Sivarani et al. 2004;\nBarbuy et al. 2005). This diversity presumably arises because\nof the range in masses of the star that underwent AGB evolution (see Herwig 2005 for a recent review), as well as due to\ndetails of internal mixing and possible variations in the level of\ndilution of the material passed to the star we now observe.\n\n\fT.

In CS 29528\u2212041 the CN bands are weak, but\nthe derived [N/H] is high because [C/H] is low and T eff is high.\nThe 336 nm NH bands are also detected in CS 29528\u2212041 and\nCS 22958\u2212042 (not shown).\n\nOther CEMP stars exhibit r-process enhancements (e.g.,\nCS 22892-052; Sneden et al. 2003); Lucatello (private communication) reports several additional likely CEMP-r stars\nfrom an analysis of the HERES sample of Barklem et al.\n(2005). Another class of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars are\nthe CEMP-r/s stars, which exhibit the presence of neutroncapture elements associated with both the r- and s-process (e.g.,\nCS 22948-027, CS 29497-034, Hill et al. 2000 and Barbuy et\nal. 2005; CS 29526-110, CS 22898-027, CS 31062-012, Aoki\n\net al. 2002c; HE 2148-1247, Cohen et al. 2003; CS 29497-030,\nIvans et al. 2005).\nMost CEMP-r/s stars also exhibit very high Pb abundances (the so-called \"lead stars,\" see Aoki et al. 2002c\nand van Eck et al. 2003).

The other two stars in our\nstudy exhibit intermediate Ba excesses ([Ba/Fe] > 0), but no\nother strong s-process-element enrichment. Thus, they fail the\n\nBeers & Christlieb (2005) criterion for the Ba ratios in CEMPno stars (which requires [Ba/Fe] < 0.0), but they may well be\nrelated to this class.\nThe origin of CEMP-no stars remains unclear at present.\nThey could, for example, be the result of pollution by AGB\nstars which, for some reason, have been unable to activate the sprocess, but have still dredged up significant amounts of carbon\nto their outer atmospheres. Alternatively, the high CNO abundances in these stars could be the products of SNe; such models have been proposed at least in the case of HE 0107-5240\n(Christlieb et al. 2002; Bonifacio et al. 2003) and HE 13272326 (Frebel et al. 2005; Iwamoto et al. 2005).\nMeasurements of C, N, and O abundances provide crucial information on the nucleosynthetic and mixing history of\nthe progenitors of CEMP stars. The 12 C/13 C ratio is a sensitive indicator of the mixing processes experienced by carbonenhanced stars; Li provides another valuable diagnostic tool.\nLithium is not detected in most CEMP stars, but is sometimes found at a level below the Spite Plateau (Norris et al.\n1997a; Aoki et al. 2002b); both observations suggest that some\nmechanism induced strong mixing and Li burning in the\npast. However, at least two known CEMP stars, LP 706-7\n(Norris et al. 1997b) and CS 22898-027 (Thorburn & Beers\n1992) exhibit Li abundances corresponding to the Spite\nPlateau. Perhaps surprisingly, both of these stars are neutroncapture-element-rich stars (Norris et al. 1997b; Aoki et al.\n2002c), although significant radial-velocity variation has yet to\nbe found in either star.\nIn this paper we present a detailed abundance analysis\nfor three main-sequence turnoff CEMP stars, CS 31080\u2212095,\nCS 22958\u2212042, and CS 29528\u2212041, based on high-resolution,\nhigh S/N observations obtained with the ESO VLT/UVES.\nMain-sequence turnoff CEMP stars are of particular interest because their present evolutionary stage precludes the significant\ninternal mixing that is expected for cooler CEMP stars, hence\ntheir atmospheres better preserve the nucleosynthetic signatures of their progenitors.\nWe describe our observations in Sect. 2. Details of our\nabundance analysis procedures are reported in Sect. 3; in Sect.\n4 we present the results, and in Sect. 5 we examine possible scenarios for the nucleosynthesis histories of these objects\nand compare them with the properties of previously observed\nCEMP stars. Our conclusions are presented in Sect. 6.\nThroughout this paper, the abbreviations VMP, EMP, UMP,\nHMP, and MMP (Very, Extremely, Ultra, Hyper, and Mega\nMetal Poor) denote stars with [Fe/H] below \u22122.0, \u22123.0, \u22124.0,\n\u22125.0, and 6.0, respectively (Beers & Christlieb 2005).\n\n2. Observations and data reduction\nOur spectroscopic data were obtained at the VLT-Kuyen 8.2m\ntelescope and UVES spectrograph (Dekker et al. 2000) at a\nresolving power of R = 43000. The coordinates of our program stars and the log of observations are listed in Table 1.\nNon-standard grating settings were used, both with dichroic #1:\n396+573, 396+850 (central wavelengths in nm in the blue and\nred arm, respectively). The central wavelengths in the red arm\n\n\fT. Sivarani et al.: First stars X.\n\nwere chosen so that both settings would cover the Li doublet,\neffectively doubling the integration time on this important line.\nThe data were reduced using the UVES context within\nMIDAS, which includes bias subtraction, flat fielding, wavelength calibration, and the merging of echelle orders. The continuum normalisation was performed with IRAF (using a cubic spline function) for the merged spectra. For a few lines\nthat were either very weak, or of particular interest, we have\nused the spectra of the individual orders without merging them.\nBalmer-line profiles were checked using both single-order and\nmerged spectra. Equivalent width measurements for unblended\nlines were obtained by fitting gaussian profiles, using the genetic algorithm code described by Fran\u00e7ois et al. (2003).\nRadial velocities (listed in Table 1) were measured from\nunblended lines in the range 380-450 nm. Multiple-epoch observations of CS 31080\u2212095 (over a range of 386 days) and\nof CS 29528\u2212041 (over a range of 45 days) do not reveal any\ndetectable radial-velocity variations, while quite large (3 km\ns\u22121 ) variations are found in CS 22958\u2212042 over only one hour.\nIf this velocity variation is correct, CS 22958\u2212042 may be another example of a very short-period binary similar to HE 00242523, as reported previously by Lucatello et al. (2003).\nU BV photometry for CS 29528\u2212041 is available from\nNorris, Ryan, & Beers (1999). For the other two stars, we obtained broadband photometry with the Danish 1.5m telescope\nat ESO, Chile (Beers et al., in preparation). Near infrared JHK\nphotometry for all three stars was available from the 2MASS\ncatalog (Skrutskie et al. 2006). Estimates of interstellar reddening along the line of sight to each star were obtained from\nSchlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis (1998). We also adopt Table 6\nfrom Schlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis (1998) for the relative extinctions of various bandpasses. The photometric data and derived parameters are listed in Table 2.\nAll our program stars have intermediate-band Str\u00f6mgren\nphotometry by Schuster et al. (2005), who estimated metallicities and photometric classifications as follows: CS 31080\u2212095:\nMS (CH), CS 22958\u2212042: TO (CH), and CS 29528\u2212041: TO,\nrespectively; these classifications are consistent with our derived surface gravities, as described below.\n\n3. Analysis\nFor a first estimate of the T eff for our program\nstars, we employed the various colours with the\nAlonso, Arribas, & Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Roger\n(1996)\ncalibrations\nof T eff for dwarf stars. The results are listed in Table 2.\nTransformations between the different photometric systems\nnecessary for use of the Alonso et al. calibrations were carried\nout as described in Sivarani et al. (2004). With the exception\nof temperatures based on the B \u2212 V colour, which is susceptible\nto the effect of molecular carbon absorption on the B-band\nflux, the colour-based estimates of T eff agree to within 125-200\nK.\nAs a likely better approach to estimating T eff we have also\nused the Fe I excitation equilibrium. The effective temperatures\nderived from this procedure, also listed in Table 2, fall within\n100K of the average of the colour-based estimates of T eff (not\nincluding the estimate based on B\u2212V). In particular, they agree\n\n5\n\nvery well (within 50K) with the temperature from V \u2212 K, which\nshould be superior due to the large baseline and the fact that\nboth the V and K bands are relatively free of molecular carbon features. We adopt the spectroscopic T eff estimates for the\nremainder of our analysis.\nThe surface gravity, log g, was derived from the Fe I/Fe II\nionisation equilibrium, and the microturbulence was determined by requiring that the abundances from the Fe I lines\nbe independent of equivalent width. The gravity we obtain for\nCS 31080-095 (log g = 4.50) is consistent with the dwarf classification by Schuster et al. (2005), and our results for CS 22958042 (log g = 3.50) and CS 29528-041 (log g = 4.00) also correspond to main-sequence TO stars. The slightly lower gravity\nof CS 22958-042 may indicate that it is a subgiant that has\nevolved slightly away from the turnoff.\n\n4. Abundances\nWe employ the same model atmospheres (OSMARCS; see\nGustafsson et al. 2003 and references therein, with appropriate C and N enhancement), current version of the\nspectrum synthesis code (turbospectrum; Alvarez & Plez\n1998), and line lists as in previous papers of this series (Hill et al. 2000; Depagne et al. 2002; Fran\u00e7ois et al.\n2003). We also use the CH molecular line list compiled\nby Plez (Plez & Cohen 2005). The NH and C2 molecular linelists are taken from the Kurucz database (http:\n//kurucz.harvard.edu/linelists/linesmol/).\nOur derived elemental abundances are listed in Table 3.\nErrors in log(\u01eb) are assigned for stars with multiple\nlines, based\n\u221a\non the errors in the mean (i.e., \u03c3(log(\u01eb))/ (N)); no errors are\nlisted for elements in which only one line was measured. Total\nerrors in [X/Fe] for each element are of the order of 0.10-0.15\ndex, taking our adopted errors of 100K in T eff and 0.5 dex in\nlog g into account. We adopt the solar abundances of Asplund,\nGrevesse, & Sauval (2005).\nCS 22958\u2212042 has no detectable Ba ([Ba/Fe] < \u22120.53)\n(Table 3); it is thus classified as a CEMP-no star, according\nto Beers & Christlieb (2005). The other two stars exhibit moderate enhancements of Ba ([Ba/Fe] = +0.77 and +0.97). These\nvalues of Ba enrichment fall below the level suggested by Beers\n& Christlieb for the CEMP-s classification ([Ba/Fe > +1.0),\nbut they do satisfy the Ryan et al. (2005) criterion for Ba-rich\nstars, [Ba/Fe]> +0.50, which is also adopted by Aoki et al.\n(2006a). Note that the Sr abundances in these two stars are quite\nlow, [Sr/Fe] = \u22120.41 (CS 31080\u2212095) and [Sr/Fe] = \u22120.20\n(CS 29528\u2212041).\nCS 31080\u2212095 and CS 22958\u2212042 are more C rich than N\nrich. In contrast, CS 29528\u2212041 is one of the most N-enhanced\nstars yet found among CEMP stars ([N/Fe] = +3.0).

Li, C, N, and the 12 C / 13 C ratio\n\n4.2. O and other \u03b1 elements\n\nWe detect the Li I 670.7 nm doublet in both CS 31080\u2212095 and\nCS 29528\u2212041 (see Fig. 1); A(Li) \u223c 1.7 is derived for both of\nthese stars. The Li line is not detected in CS 22958\u2212042; we\nderive an upper limit of A(Li) < 0.6 (3\u03c3). It would clearly be\nof interest to obtain higher-S/N spectra of this star in order to\nstrengthen this limit.\nBoth CS 31080\u2212095 and CS 22958\u2212042 exhibit very large\nC enhancements; [C/Fe] = +2.75 and [C/Fe] = +3.15, respectively, as estimated from the average of results derived from the\nCH and C2 features. In CS 29528\u2212041 the C2 lines are not detected; only the weak CH lines could be used to estimate [C/Fe]\nin this star.\nNitrogen abundances for our stars are obtained from the\nCN 388.3 nm band (see Fig. 2); for CS 22958\u2212042 and\nCS 29528\u2212041 we also use the NH band at 336 nm. The NH\nand CN lines yield slightly different abundances; we adopt the\nresults from the CN lines, which have better S/N.\nThe 13 CH lines at 401.9 nm (see Fig. 3) and the 13 C, 12 C\n474.0 nm lines are used to derive 12 C/13 C ratios. Only a weak\nlower limit on the 12 C/13 C ratio resulted for CS 31080\u2212095,\nwhile a clear determination of 12 C/13 C = 9.0 is found for\nCS 22958\u2212042. The high T eff and moderate C enhancement in\nCS 29528\u2212041 make the 13 C features very weak, and prevent\nus from placing any useful limits on 12 C/13 C in this star.\n\nWe estimate O abundances by LTE analysis of the O I 777.4 nm\ntriplet, recognising that it is affected by both NLTE (Kiselman\n1991; Takeda 1994; Gratton et al. 1999; Kiselman 2001) and\n3D effects (Asplund 2005). In CS 31080\u2212095 the triplet lines\nare quite strong; we derive [O/Fe] = +2.35. We do not detect the\nO I lines in CS 29528\u2212041; hence we only obtain an upper limit\nof [O/Fe] < +1.4 (3\u03c3). The [O/Fe] values in Table 3 include the\nNLTE corrections by Gratton et al. (1999).\nWe find [Mg/Fe] \u223c +0.65 in CS 31080\u2212095 and [Mg/Fe]=\n+0.32 and +0.4 in CS 22958\u2212042 and CS 29528\u2212041, respectively, similar to most other VMP stars. Si is overabundant by\n+0.05 to +0.15 dex in CS 31080\u2212095 and CS 22958\u2212042, and\nCa is overabundant in all three stars by +0.2 to +0.4 dex.\n\n4.3. The odd-Z elements\nSodium abundances for our stars are determined using the Na I\nD lines, which can be affected by NLTE. We have applied the\nNLTE corrections by Baum\u00fcller et al. (1998), as listed in their\nTable 2. The Na I D lines in CS 22958\u2212042 are well separated\nfrom the significant interstellar component, due to the high radial velocity of this star. In CS 29528\u2212041 the Na I D1 line\nmerges with the interstellar Na I D2 line, so we derive the Na\nabundance from the D2 line alone. Aluminium is underabun-\n\n\fT. Sivarani et al.: First stars X.\n\ndant in all three stars after an NLTE correction of +0.65 dex\n(Baum\u00fcller and Gehren 1997).\n\n4.4. The iron-peak elements\nThe abundances of Ti, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Co, and Ni are similar in\nall three stars, and close to the values reported for halo stars in\nthe same metallicity range (e.g., Cayrel et al. 2004).\n\n4.5. The neutron-capture elements\nWe derive strontium abundance estimates for our stars from the\nSr II 407.7 nm and 421.5 nm lines. All three of our program\nstars exhibit Sr underabundances, from \u22120.2 to \u22120.4 dex. A\nweak Y II line at 377.4 nm is also detected in CS 31080\u2212095,\nfrom which we derive [Y/Fe] = \u22120.35. Barium is moderately overabundant in both CS 31080\u2212095 and CS 29528\u2212041,\nwhile it appears to be quite low in CS 22958\u2212042. Barium\nabundances were estimated from the Ba II 455.4 nm and 493.4\nnm lines. For CS 22958\u2212042 , we could not detect any Ba II\nlines at all, and derive an upper limit of [Ba/Fe] < \u22120.53 (3\u03c3),\nadopting the hyperfine splitting by McWilliam (1998) for Ba II\nand assuming a solar isotopic composition.\n\n5. Discussion\nHere we discuss the results for our three program stars in the\ncontext of the CEMP class as a whole. Table 4 lists elemental\nabundances and 12 C/13 C ratios for CEMP stars from the recent\nliterature, grouped into the CEMP-no, CEMP-s, and CEMP-r/s\nclasses. Our two moderately Ba-enhanced stars form a fourth\ngroup, which we call CEMP-no/s stars.\nWe first discuss the C and N abundances for our CEMP\nstars. We next describe the nature of the oxygen abundance\nin these stars, followed by a discussion of Na, Mg, and other\nheavier elements. The variation of the 12 C/13 C ratio with Li\nabundance is then considered.\n\n5.1. C and N abundances in CEMP stars\nCS 31080\u2212095 and CS 22958\u2212042 exhibit strong C and N enhancements, similar to most other CEMP stars. CS 22958\u2212042\nstands out as one of the most carbon-rich of the known CEMP\nstars, while CS 29528\u2212041 exhibits one of the largest N abundances yet observed in CEMP stars.\nFig. 4 shows a broad overall correlation of the C and N\noverabundances in most CEMP stars. Note that the \"carbonnormal\" stars from Spite et al. (2005), shown in the lower left\npart of the figure, display a clear anti-correlation between C\nand N due to mixing with CNO-cycled material (see also Spite\net al. 2006).\nC and N have distinct nucleosynthetic formation paths: C is\nmade by He burning in the triple-\u03b1 process, while N production\nrequires H burning, i.e., two proton captures on 12 C. Because\nthe production site of primary C, the He-burning zone, is void\nof protons, primary C must be mixed out of the He-burning\nregion and into the H-rich outer layers under conditions that are\n\n7\n\nstill hot enough for effective proton capture. Thus, in a sense, it\nis not surprising to see high C and N together.\nHowever, in stellar models it is very difficult to realize the\nspecific conditions for He and H burning and mixing that can\nproduce the observed abundance patterns quantitatively. HotBottom Burning (HBB) in intermediate-mass stars has long\nbeen the only solid candidate site for primary N production.\nCarbon is produced in the He-shell flashes and dredged up\ninto the envelope after the thermal pulse. During the interpulse\nphase between He-shell flashes the convective envelope connects with the outer layers of the H-burning shell, and the C in\nthe envelope is transformed into N.\nAs shown, for example, by the 4-6 M\u2299 models of Herwig\n(2004), the mass-averaged ejecta of such of VMP intermediatemass stars can reach [N/Fe] \u223c +2 to +3. Hot-bottom burning in\nintermediate-mass stars is characterized by very efficient conversion of C and O into N. This finding is model independent.\nThe C overabundance in 4-6 M\u2299 VMP models is in the range\n[C/Fe] \u223c +1 to +2.\nFor stars that show no sign of the main component of the\ns-process or of being binaries, one must consider other possible sources for the observed C and N overabundances. Massive\nstars have been often dismissed in the past because of the inability of standard models to produce primary N. This inability is related to the above-mentioned necessity of mixing Heburning products (C) out into the H-burning region.\nHowever, the recent models by Hirschi et al. (2006) and\nMeynet, Ekstr\u00f6m, & Maeder (2006) show that massive, MMP\n([Fe/H] < \u22126.0) stars that include the effect of rotationallyinduced mixing have the desired ability to produce large\namounts of primary N (which is required to match the observed\nbehavior of [N/O] at low metallicity, even among \"carbon normal\" stars; see Chiappini et al. 2006). The C and N abundance\nsignatures of rotating 60 M\u2299 models and the E-AGB envelopes\nof intermediate-mass stars (7 M\u2299 ) are quite similar (Meynet,\nEkstr\u00f6m, & Maeder 2006).\nC and N abundances from HBB models with initial mass 2\nM\u2299 and non-HBB AGB models with initial mass 6 M\u2299 (Herwig\n2004) are indicated in Fig. 4. Note that because these (as well\nas the massive-star model predictions) are primary yields, they\nshift along diagonals through zero in the [C/Fe]-[N/Fe] diagram as a function of [Fe/H]. There is more than a one dex difference in [Fe/H] between the HBB models and the non-HBB\nmodels. These two classes of models seem to delimit the region\noccupied by the CEMP stars.\nMost CEMP stars in Figure 4 are located in an intermediate\nregime, showing larger N and smaller C overabundances than\npredicted by the the 2 and 3 M\u2299 AGB models, but less N and\nmore C than predicted by the HBB AGB models. One of our\nprogram stars, CS 22958\u2212042 , falls into this category as well.\nNote, however, that CS 31080\u2212095 exhibits [N/Fe] and [C/Fe]\nratios in almost perfect agreement with the non-HBB models.\nMost other CEMP stars exhibit too strong N to be explained by standard low-mass AGB companions.

The C and N\nabundances suggest that CS 29528\u2212041 is at least one candidate for these \"missing\" NEMP stars.\n\n5.2. Oxygen\nThe C and N overabundances of CS 31080\u2212095 and\nCS 22958\u2212042 are typical of CEMP stars in general; however,\nthey also exhibit significant O overabundances ([O/Fe] = +2.35\nand +1.35, respectively). Near solar metallicity, the production\nof O in AGB stars is negligible. It is therefore at first sight\nsurprising to see large overabundances of O in stars that are\nconsidered to be substantially polluted by AGB stars.\nHowever, for [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22122, AGB models produce primary\nO quite efficiently. In the model yields by Herwig (2004), the\nO overabundances range from [O/Fe] = +1.84 for the 2 M\u2299\ncase to [O/Fe] = +0.39 for the 6 M\u2299 case. Again, because these\nare primary yields, they would to first order increase at lower\n[Fe/H]. Note that the O overabundance in the yields of Herwig\n\n(2004) should be a minimum, as they do not take convective\novershoot into account; this would increase the O abundance in\nthe AGB intershell region and increase the yields even further.\nThe O abundance in the He-shell flash convection zone is\nabout 1-2% by mass, almost independent of metallicity. At solar metallicity this is about the initial abundance level. Thus,\nany primary O produced in the He-shell flash convection zone\nthat is dredged up into the envelope will not significantly increase the surface O abundance. However, at extremely low\nmetallicity, the envelope initially contains much less O than\nthe primary O contained in the He-flash intershell material that\nis dredged up into the envelope. Therefore, even a seemingly\nsmall O abundance of 1-2% in the intershell region leads to a\nsignificant O excess compared to the initial O abundance. The\nexistence of such an enhanced intershell O abundance is supported by observations of hot H-deficient central stars of planetary nebulae (Werner & Herwig 2006).\nFor CS 29528\u2212041 the low upper limit for O is consistent with HBB AGB predictions. For CS 31080\u2212095 and\n\n\f10\n\nT. Sivarani et al.: First stars X.\n\nCS 22958\u2212042 the O abundance fits into the picture where the\nobserved abundances are produced by non-HBB AGB stars.\n\n3\n\n5.3. Sodium\n\n5.4. Neutron-capture elements\nThe first s-process-peak elements Sr and Y are low in our stars\n(Y is detected only in CS 31080\u2212095), at the level seen in\nfield giants of similar metallicity (Fran\u00e7ois et al. 2006). The\nsecond-peak s-process element Ba is moderately overabundant\nin CS 31080\u2212095 and CS 29528\u2212041; these two stars defy a\n\n[Ba/Sr]\n\n2\n\nSodium is extremely important for understanding the nuclear\nproduction site of CEMP-star abundances. A small amount\nof secondary Na can be made by C-burning in massive stars.\nHowever, with the large overabundances of Na observed in\nCS 22958\u2212042 ([Na/Fe] = +2.82) and CS 29528\u2212041 ([Na/Fe]\n= +1.20) and many other CEMP stars, we need to look for a\nprimary source of Na.\nAs explained above, primary production of 14 N is difficult\nbecause it requires the He-burning ashes to be exposed to burning again, which requires mixing. For Na this concept must\nbe taken two steps further. Once there is primary 14 N from successive He and H burning, the 14 N must be brought back into\nthe region of He burning in order to capture two \u03b1-particles.\nThe result is primary 22 Ne, which must then capture either a\nneutron or a proton in order to make 23 Na. Through the recurrent, interconnected He-shell flash and dredge-up events,\nAGB stars provide a natural environment for producing significant amounts of primary Na. In fact, AGB stars of all masses,\nwhether HBB or not, are predicted to produce primary Na.\nPrimary 14 N exists in the ashes of the H-burning shell after\na few thermal pulses with dredge-up. This 14 N is engulfed by\nthe next He-shell flash and transformed into 22 Ne. In non-HBB\nAGB stars a neutron released from the 22 Ne(\u03b1,n)25 Mg reaction can be captured by 22 Ne again, leading to the production\nof 23 Na; this 22 Ne n-capture is very efficient. In more massive\nAGB stars, the dominant effect is the Ne-Na cycle burning of\ndredged-up 22 Ne during HBB. In any case, the predicted AGB\nproduction range is [Na/Fe] \u223c +1.0 to \u223c +1.7. Again, since\nthis is a primary production, this number would to first order\nincrease at lower [Fe/H].\nHence, while rotating massive stars have been shown to be\nable to mix primary C out of the core into the H-burning shell\nand thus produce primary N, Na production requires that this\nN be exposed to He-burning once again. This may be difficult\nto achieve in massive stars.\nSodium is very low in CS 31080\u2212095, which poses a problem if one interprets its CNO abundance as a result of AGB\npollution. The low Na abundance in CS 31080\u2212095, together\nwith its high Mg and low Al abundance, does in fact fit the\nwell-known odd-even pattern that is characteristic of massivestar yields at low metallicity. The other two stars show this\nodd-even pattern starting at Mg; apparently, some additional\nprimary source of Na filled in the low Na expected from the\nstandard odd-even effect.\n\nCS 29528-041\n1\nCS 31080-095\n0\nCS 22958-042\n\n-1\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n[Sr/Fe]\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nFig. 5. [Sr/Fe] vs. [Ba/Sr] for the CEMP stars in Table 4 (filled\nsymbols: this paper). [Ba/Sr] ratios for CS 31080\u2212095 and\nCS 29528\u2212041 falls in between CEMP-s stars and CEMP-no\nstars.\n\nclear classification into either CEMP-s or CEMP-no, as can\nbe seen in Fig. 5. All the CEMP-no stars listed in Table 4 are\nmildly C-rich and have much lower Ba than our two stars. At\nvery low metallicities there might be an r-process component of\nBa, but Sr should then be higher than observed in our program\nstars. Accurate heavy-element abundances for a larger number\nof CEMP stars is clearly needed to determine the origin of the\nheavy elements.\nIn Table 4, CS 31080\u2212095 and CS 29528\u2212041 define a\nnew class, CEMP-no/s, with properties intermediate between\nthe CEMP-no and CEMP-s classes. In contrast, CS 22949-037\n(Depagne et al. 2002) displays a moderate Sr enhancement and\nlow Ba abundance.\nCS 31080\u2212095 and CS 22958\u2212042 exhibit exactly opposing behaviour with regard to Ba and Na. The interpretation of\nthis result is not clear. The C/N ratio of both stars indicate that\nthey carry the signature of non-HBB AGB stars of low mass.\nModels predict qualitatively that for non-HBB AGB stars Ba\nand Na should both be enhanced. In particular the large Na\nand small Ba abundance of CS 22958\u2212042 means most of the\nNa has not been produced by neutron captures on 22 Ne in the\nHe-shell flash. However, as explained above, neutron captures\nare the source Na in low-mass EMP stellar models. Compared\nto CS 31080\u2212095 CS 22958\u2212042 has also a larger N/O abundance than the low-mass stellar evolution models (cf. Fig. 6).\nThis indicates that the excess Na in CS 22958\u2212042 has orinated\nin p-captures, possibly in a cool-bottom burning type extramixing. It is conceivable that tidal interactions in the binary\nsystem have induced a variation of mixing, that could explain\nthe difference between CS 31080\u2212095 and CS 22958\u2212042.\n\n\fT.

The abundances of CS 29528\u2212041 agree well with HBB model predictions for an\nAGB mass of 4-6 M\u2299 , but the other two stars are better matched by lower-mass AGB models. However, the observed high N\nabundances require enhanced mixing, and the observed Na may differ more than expected from current models.\n\n5.5. Li in CEMP stars\nFew CEMP stars presently have spectra of sufficient quality\nfrom which abundances or upper limits on A(Li) can be termined. For CEMP-s stars the source of this Li is most likely a\nformer AGB companion star, now a white dwarf. While evolving through the giant phase, low- and intermediate-mass stars\nare expected to deplete their initial Li (e.g. CS 22948-027,\nCS 29497-034, and LP 625-44). Cool dwarfs should also exhibit low Li, due to convection-driven depletion in the star itself\n(e.g., G 77-61).\nLithium should be preserved in warm dwarfs (T e f f >\n5700K). The existence of stars with A(Li) slightly below the\nSpite Plateau (e.g., CS 31080\u2212095 and CS 29528\u2212041) indicates that some Li has been destroyed due to mixing processes in the progenitor(s) that produced the C (and N) enhancement. Some other CEMP stars, e.g., CS 22958\u2212042 or\nCS 29497-030, have values of T eff and log g such that Li should\nnot have been depleted; yet A(Li) is considerably below the\nSpite Plateau. While stars with Li slightly below the Spite\nPlateau can be explained by transfer of Li-depleted material\nfrom an AGB companion, a star like CS 22958\u2212042 must have\nbeen Li-poor already before this event.\n\nFinally, the two CEMP-s stars LP 706-7 and CS 22898-027\nhave Li abundances corresponding to the Spite Plateau. This\nimplies that the donor star has produced some Li, in an amount\nfinely tuned to keep Li close to the Spite Plateau value on the\ncompanion star we now observe. A similar process has been\nsuggested for the main-sequence turnoff stars in the globular\ncluster NGC 6397 (Bonifacio et al. 2002).\nSeveral mechanisms can in fact produce Li both during\nthe Red Giant Branch (RGB) and AGB phases. On the RGB,\na mechanism invoking enhanced, rotationally-induced mixing\nhas been proposed and explored by Denissenkov & Herwig\n(2004). This is a particularly effective variant of the coolbottom processing proposed to explain some of the abundance anomalies in corundum grains and globular clusters\n(Wasserburg, Boothroyd, & Sackmann 1995; Boothroyd &\nSackmann 1999).\nEnhanced mixing on the RGB can produce Li in a star that\nhas depleted all its primordial Li, but it cannot produce the large\noverabundances of primary C, N, and O that are observed in the\nCEMP stars. However, if enhanced mixing is possible, and observed in RGB stars, it may be possible on the AGB as well,\nbut it has not been yet been considered in any evolution model\nfor VMP AGB stars. The only quantitative treatment of such\n\n\fT. Sivarani et al.: First stars X.\n\n5.6.\n\n12 C / 13 C\n\nratios\n\nMost CEMP-s stars exhibit carbon isotope ratios in the\nrange 12 C/13 C \u223c 10-20, but the CEMP-no stars, including\nCS 22958\u2212042, have 12 C/13 C \u223c 3-10 (CS 29502-092 is an\nexception). Fig. 7 shows 12 C/13 C vs A(Li) for CEMP stars\nwith published detections or limits on these two quantities.\n12 13\nC/ C appears to be higher the in CEMP stars with detected\nlithium, but additional efforts to place tighter constraints on\nboth 12 C/13 C and Li in CEMP stars are clearly needed.\nStandard VMP AGB star models predict that HBB produces 12 C/13 C \u223c 10, while non-HBB models yield 12 C/13 C of\nthe order of 103 \u2212 104 . The fact that no CEMP star in Table\n4 (in particular no CEMP-s or CEMP-r/s star) has such a high\n12 13\nC/ C ratio is probably the clearest evidence that standard\nAGB models are neglecting some mixing mechanism. Even at\nsolar metallicities the AGB models yield higher 12 C/13 C ratios than are observed, indicating the need for extra mixing\n\n50\n\n40\nCS 31080-095\n30\nC/13C\n\nan evolution scenario was by Nollett, Busso, & Wasserburg\n(2003), who focused on isotopic ratios in solar metallicity AGB\nstars, but not on Li. We may, nevertheless, speculate that dwarf\nCEMP-s stars with detectable Li may be the result of enhanced\nmixing during the AGB phase of their companions.\nWe cannot exclude this origin for Li in CS 31080\u2212095. The\nfact that enhanced-mixing RGB models predict a low 12 C/13 C\nratio does not necessarily disagree with the high 12 C/13 C measured in CS 31080\u2212095, because the enhanced mixing may\noccur only in a transitional phase, followed (or preceded) by\nefficient third dredge-up of primary 12 C. Third dredge-up will\nincrease the 12 C/13 C ratio, but in low-mass AGB stars Li could\nstill survive, at least partially. Clearly, a detailed theoretical investigation of this scenario is highly desirable.\nAnother mechanism to produce Li in AGB stars is the wellknown HBB process, which operates in more massive AGB\nstars. The lower mass limit for HBB decreases with declining\nmetallicity and is about 3.5 M\u2299 for [Fe/H] = \u22122.3. Li production by HBB and efficient transformation of primary C into\nN are robust predictions of intermediate-mass stellar evolution\nmodels; CS 29528\u2212041 seems to fit this pattern.\nFinally, a number of studies of the evolution of EMP, UMP,\nor zero-metallicity AGB stars have invoked the so-called Hingestion flash to account for the observed abundance patterns\nin some of the more extreme CEMP stars (Fujimoto, Ikeda,\n& Iben 2000; Herwig 2003; Iwamoto et al. 2004; Suda et al.\n2004). The H-ingestion flash can also be a source of Li, as was\nfirst described by Herwig & Langer (2001) in the context of\nthe born-again post-AGB stars (Werner & Herwig 2006), and\nconfirmed by Iwamoto et al. (2004) for VMP stars and by Suda\net al. (2004) for EMP and HMP AGB stars.\nUnfortunately, quantitative abundance predictions for this\nevent remain very uncertain because of our poor understanding of the coupled mixing and burning processes that are involved. Probably, a H-ingestion flash that produces Li is followed by several thermal pulses with efficient 12 C dredge-up,\nwhich would also make this scenario a candidate for explaining\nthe observed Li abundance in CS 31080\u2212095.\n\n12\n\n12\n\n20\nCS 22958-042\n10\n\n0\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\nlog(Li)\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\nFig. 7. 12 C/13 C vs. A(Li) for the CEMP stars in Table 4 (symbols as in Fig. 4; arrows indicate limits). The Li-rich CEMP\nstars tend to have high 12 C/13 C ratios.\n(Charbonnel 1998). The extra-mixing process invoked above\nto account for the unexpectedly low C/N ratios in all CEMP-s\nstars is qualitatively suitable to produce the observed 12 C/13 C\nratios as well.\n\n6. Conclusions\nThe origin of the observed abundance patterns of CEMP stars\nremains enigmatic. Fig. 6 summarises how the abundances in\nour stars compare to the predicted abundances in AGB ejecta\nof very low metallicity, presumably transferred to the observed\nstars from former AGB binary companions. It should be recognized that the stars have lower [Fe/H] than the models. Because\nall the overabundances shown are dominated by the primary\nproduction in AGB stars, this could be corrected to first order by just adding the Fe abundance difference (in logarithmic\nunits). However, a stringent comparison of models and actual\nstellar observations must include the problems of mass transfer and dilution. For that reason, one should not pay too much\nattention to absolute overabundances of 0.5 \u2013 1 dex, but rather\nfocus on the abundance patterns.\nIn our small sample, CS 29528\u2212041 is probably the most\nstraightforward case; all available evidence points toward pollution from a HBB AGB star. CS 29528\u2212041 is one of the\nvery few known NEMP stars, the existence of which is predicted by standard stellar evolution in conjunction with the\nbinary mass-transfer scenario for CEMP-s stars. The moderate Ba overabundance in this star may be due to a polluting\nAGB star of large mass. The CNO abundances would also be\ncompatible with pollution from a massive, rotating star. The\ns-process in these (or indeed any VMP AGB) stars is not yet\nunderstood. However, the observed Li, Na, and Ba abundances\nclearly favour the AGB alternative.\nAssuming that the measured rapid velocity variation for\nCS 22958\u2212042 is due to a binary orbital motion of short pe-\n\n\fT. Sivarani et al.: First stars X.\n\nriod, the AGB connection strongly suggests that this star is a\nmember of a post-common-envelope binary. This must be the\ncase if the overabundances are attributed to mass-transfer from\nan AGB star.\nWe can only speculate about the effects of commonenvelope phase on the nuclear signatures in a CEMP star that\nformed from this mechanism. One scenario could involve several thermal pulses with efficient dredge-up causing the observed overabundances of C, N, O and Na. However, before\nthe s-process production can get fully underway, AGB evolution is terminated by the onset of common-envelope evolution.\nThis could explain the absence of Ba in this star.\nAnother CEMP star with a short orbital period is HE 00242523 (Lucatello et al. 2003), which must be a post-common\nenvelope object as well. However, in that star Ba (and other\nheavy elements) are overabundant without doubt. These two\nshort-period binaries have contrasting Na signatures: Na is underabundant in HE 0024-2523, but CS 22958\u2212042 is one of the\nmost Na-rich stars yet found.\nBoth HE 0024-2523 and CS 22958\u2212042 have very large\nC/O ratios, although O is significantly overabundant: C/O= 48\nin CS 22958\u2212042, and 100 in HE 0024-2523. A very large C/O\nratio may present a problem for the AGB mass-transfer scenario, because a non-HBB AGB star can only deliver material\nwith a lower C/O ratio than found anywhere inside of it. The\nmaterial dredged up to the surface, usually from the intershell,\ncontains from one to a few percent primary O by mass, almost\nindependent of metallicity, and also maybe 20 \u2212 25% carbon\nby mass1 . Thus, C/O < 32 is a reasonable limit for the intershell layers of AGB stars (including VMP AGB stars). Even if\nthe AGB star dumps this maximally polluted material onto the\nCEMP star we now observe, the resulting C/O ratio cannot become larger than in the intershell layer. The C/O ratio could be\na problem for the two known short-period binaries, but perhaps\nespecially for HE 0024-2523.\nClearly, common-envelope evolution introduces a whole\nnew family of possible evolutionary outcomes. Nevertheless,\nit is noteworthy that we may have found the second shortperiod CEMP binary, which seems to be significantly different from the previously known case, HE 0024-2523. One of\nthe two might in fact not be a post-common envelope system,\nbut have an inert low-mass MS companion instead. However,\nVMP AGB stars remain the best present candidate nuclear production sites for explaining both the s-process enhancement in\nHE 0024-2523 and the high Na in CS 22958\u2212042.\nFinally, CS 31080\u2212095 could be an AGB mass-transfer object if VMP non-HBB AGB stars experience some extra mixing. This could account for the observed Li, C, and N abundances. The O abundance in this star is certainly high compared to the predictions of this scenario, but cannot rule it out.\nThe problem is the low Na abundance, which excludes AGB\nprogenitors above 2 M\u2299 . Perhaps a less massive AGB star is\ninvolved, in which the 22 Ne source is not activated at all; the Ba\ncould then still come from the 13 C neutron source. The larger\n1\nThese C and O abundances are for models without extra convective mixing. If such mixing is included both C and O increase, but the\nC/O ratio does not change much.\n\n13\n\n12\n\nC/13 C ratio (> 40) in this star is consistent with this picture,\nand inconsistent with the obvious alternatives; the 12 C/13 C ratios in HBB AGB stars (12 C/13 C \u223c 10) as well as the wind\nejecta of rotating massive stars ( 12 C/13 C \u223c 4) are much lower\nthan the observed limit.\nThis discussion has clearly shown that our current understanding of the origin of the abundance patterns in CEMP stars\nis still in its infancy. The large overabundances of some elements in CEMP stars probe one or more important primary nuclear production sites, including those that may have set the\nstage for the following galactic chemical evolution. Yet, we remain far from having identified even the main players in this\ngame. Tasks to be addressed include a better understanding of\nmixing in stars of all masses, and of the impact of binary evolution on nucleosynthesis. A significant increase in the numbers\nof CEMP stars with accurate, detailed elemental abundances is\nalso an obvious next step.\nAcknowledgements.
