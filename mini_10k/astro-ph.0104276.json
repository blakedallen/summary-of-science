From\nthe first structures, with typical masses between 105 and 108 M\u2299 , it is believed that a very\nearly generation of stars, Population III, formed. Since the chemical content of these first\nstructures was primordial (H, 4 He and traces of D, 3 He and 7 Li), this first generation of\nstars must have been formed essentially free of metals (Z \u223c 10\u22129 ).\nThe possible existence of Population III was originally postulated because of the\npresence of metal overabundances in Population II stars and especially due to the so-called\nG-dwarf problem: the discrepancy between the number of observed low mass metal-poor\nstars and that predicted by simple (closed) models of chemical evolution (Pagel 1997). This\nled to the idea that very shortly after the Big Bang and some time before the formation of\nthe first galaxies (z \u223c 3), a generation of stars polluted the universe with metals (Cayrel\n1986). Recent metal-poor stellar count surveys in the halo and thick disk of the Galaxy\n(Beers, Preston & Shectman 1985, 1992) support this scenario, finding only a handful of\nstars with [Fe/H]\u2264 \u221231 . The observational evidence of a very low number of metal-poor\nlow-mass stars suggests that the very first star formation episode was biased towards large\nstellar masses. Extremely low-mass metal-poor stars are not seen simply because they did\nnot form, i.e. if Population III were made up of very massive rapidly evolving stars, there\nwould be no possibility of observing them today.\n1\n\nIn this work we use the standard notation [X/Y]\u2261log (X/Y)object \u2212log(X/Y)\u2299 for any\n\nchemical species\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nThe existence of Population III is related to many important issues. This population\nof stars could play an important role in the reionization of the universe (Miralda-Escud\u00e9\n& Rees 1998; Gnedin 2000; Fan et al. 2000) compensating for the fact that the known\npopulations of quasars and star-forming galaxies are not sufficient to account for the\nrequired number of ionizing photons at z \u2265 5. Alternatively, massive remnants (black holes)\nas the end-products of these primordial stars could have been the progenitors of the current\nactive galactic nuclei, while the less massive remnants (ancient white dwarfs) could have\nmade a contribution to the MACHO population found in the halo of our galaxy (M\u00e9ndez\n& Minniti 2000; Alcock, C. et al. 2000; Laserre et al. 2000) although this contribution\nis strongly limited by the observed white-dwarf luminosity function as well as by energetic\narguments (Isern et al. 1998, 1999). Obviously, the real significance of Population III stars\nin the above issues is determined by the nature of the initial mass function (IMF) of the\nfirst generation of stars.\nThe idea of a pregalactic metal enrichment has become increasingly important in recent\nyears because of the discovery of intergalactic metals in Ly-\u03b1 forest clouds (N(HI) \u2264 1017\ncm\u22122 ) at z = 3 \u2212 3.5 showing metal abundances of Z \u223c 10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22122 Z\u2299 (Songaila 1997;\nCowie & Songaila 1998; Ellison et al. 2000). Sargent et al. (1980) were the first to identify\nthe Ly-\u03b1 forest with a population of primordial hydrogen clouds in pressure equilibrium\nwith a hotter, expanding intergalactic medium (IGM). This picture, however, has changed\nrecently to one in which the Ly-\u03b1 forest is, in fact, the IGM at very early epochs. Therefore,\nthese high redshifted clouds are believed to be essentially composed of unprocessed material\nfrom which the galaxies were formed. However, the gas producing the Ly-\u03b1 forest is not\npristine since a significant fraction of the detected lines are associated with C IV absorptions\nat \u03bb\u03bb1548, 1550 \u00c5 (Tytler et al. 1995; Cowie et al. 1995; Songaila & Cowie 1996). The\ncarbon abundance implied by these detections is [C/H]\u223c \u22122.5, although with an important\ndispersion within the forest (see e.g. Borksemberg et al. 1998). Whether the metals found\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nhave a local origin associated with the Ly-\u03b1 lines observed, or are due to an early episode\nof star formation (Population III) is still unclear. The answer to this question might come\nfrom metal abundance studies in very low density clouds (N(H I)\u2264 1014 cm\u22122 ). However,\ndifferent investigations have reached conflicting conclusions. Lu et al. (1998) concluded\nthat there is a sudden decrease of the C abundance at low column densities ([C/H]\u2264 \u22123.5\nfor N(H I)< 1014 cm\u22122 ). Cowie & Songaila (1998), however, claimed a roughly constant C\nIV abundance distribution all the way down to Ly\u2212\u03b1 optical depths \u03c4 (Ly \u2212 \u03b1) \u223c 0.5 \u2212 1.\nMore recently, Ellison et al. (2000) have shown that the differences in redshift and velocity\ndispersion between Ly-\u03b1 and C IV absorptions prevent us, at present, from answering of\nwhether there is a uniform degree of metal enrichment down to the lowest values of N(H I).\nAn indirect way to infer the possible existence of Population III and the nature of its\nstellar mass function is to search for the imprints that could have been left in the IGM\nand/or in the subsequent generation of stars formed from the material ejected, that is:\nthe chemical imprint. In this paper we reexamine the issue of the chemical pollution that\ncould have originated Population III. To do so, we make use of strictly zero metal (Z = 0)\nstellar models in the mass range 3 \u2264 m/M\u2299 \u2264 200 (see below). As an output, these\nmodels predict stellar yields for a number of significant isotopes which are the result of\nthe nucleosynthetic processes occurring during the evolution of the stars. These processes\ninclude those occurring in the thermal-pulsing AGB phase (TP-AGB) for the intermediate\nstellar mass range (3 . m/M\u2299 . 8), in type II supernova (SNII) explosions (m & 8 M\u2299 )\nand in very massive objects (VMO, m & 100 M\u2299 ).\nThe paper is structured as follows: The observational constraints used to limit our\nmodel predictions are discussed in section 2. The stellar yields for zero-metal stars are\npresented in section 3. Section 4 describes the IMF proposed for Population III. In section\n5, we use these tools to study the chemical consequences from a burst of Population III stars\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nand from a simple chemical evolution model. Our conclusions are summarized in section 6.\n\n2.\n\nThe observational constraints\n\nThe main observational constraint concerns the detection of metals in the Lyman-\u03b1\nforest spectra of distant QSOs. Since the Ly-\u03b1 forest is being interpreted as intergalactic\nclouds, containing slightly contaminated primordial material, there must be some\nmechanism of mildly polluting them. Whether an early episode of pregalactic star formation\n(Population III)2 is required or not to explain these abundances is still unclear. As\nmentioned in \u00a71, the key factor might be whether C IV lines continue to be seen in the\nLy-\u03b1 clouds of decreasing H I column density. Note, that a considerable fraction of the\nmetals detected in the Ly-\u03b1 forest systems might have been produced by non zero-metal\nstars in already formed galaxies, and eventually ejected into the IGM by galactic winds.\nHere, we will assume as a working hypothesis that the metal contamination observed in\nthe Ly-\u03b1 forest clouds is due to a pregalactic population of stars, i.e. Population III stars.\nObservations by Cowie & Songaila (1998), Songaila (1997) and Ellison et al. (2000)\nin the direction of highly redshifted QSOs have revealed line absorptions due to C, N, O\nand Si. Although the abundances derived are sensitive to ionization corrections (Schaerer,\nIzotov & Charbonnel 2000), these studies obtained [C/H]\u223c \u22122.5 and [Si/H]\u223c \u22122.3 with a\nscatter of about a factor of 3 in systems with z = 3 \u2212 3.5 (no abundance ratios are given\nfor N and O). Scaling these values to the solar metallicity implies that these systems have a\nmetallicity of Z\u223c 4 \u00d7 10\u22123 Z\u2299 , or [Fe/H]\u223c \u22122.4. Note, however, that current observational\ntechniques used to derive metal abundances in the Ly-\u03b1 systems cannot properly account\nfor the inhomogeneity of the IGM and, therefore, these techniques probably give only lower\n2\n\nWe consider the Population III objects as stars with Z = 0.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nlimits on Z. Nevertheless, as mentioned above, here we adopt these abundance ratios as the\ntypical level of chemical enrichment in the IGM produced by the hypothetical Population\nIII.\nOur second observational constraint comes from the metal absorptions detected in very\ndistant systems with a high density of H I, N(H I)& 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 , i.e.: the damped-Lyman\nsystems. In modern cosmological theories, damped systems are assumed to be more highly\nevolved objects than the Ly-\u03b1 forest and probably represent the earliest stages of the\npresent-day disc galaxies (Wolfe 1995). These systems provide the best opportunity to\nmeasure abundances of different elements at high redshifts. Numerous abundance studies in\nthese systems [see Pettini (1999) for a compilation] have clearly established that the cosmic\nmetallicity inferred in neutral gas does not evolve significantly from z \u223c 1 to 4 although the\nunweighted metallicity exhibits a statistically significant decrease with increasing redshift\n(Prochaska, Gawrser & Wolfe 2001). The mean metal abundance in these systems between\nz = 1 \u2212 4 is Z \u223c 6 \u00d7 10\u22122 Z\u2299 (or [Fe/H]\u223c \u22121.2), although with a range of almost two orders\nof magnitude in the metallicity attained by different damped systems at essentially the same\nredshift. The main difficulty encountered in these abundance studies is to account for the\nfraction of each element that has been removed from the gas phase to form interstellar dust.\nDespite this, most of the abundance ratios measured are similar to the abundance pattern\nexpected from solely SNII pollution (Lu et al. 1998), although not all the abundance\nratios derived follow this SNII pattern (Prochaska & Wolfe 1999; Pettini 1999). The\nlimitations introduced by these abundance ratios upon the enrichment from Population III\nare not clear, since if they are considered more evolved objects, the abundance pattern in\ndamped systems may be the result of several episodes of star formation. Therefore, it does\nnot reflect the result of the very first metal pollution. We note, however, that no damped\nsystem is observed with [Fe/H]< \u22122.7 (Prochaska & Wolfe 2000).\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nFinally, the abundance ratios found in the most extremely metal-poor stars in our\ngalaxy constitute another observational constraint to the early chemical evolution. For\ninstance, one of the most striking results of these studies is that \u223c 25% of the stars with\n[Fe/H]. \u22122.5 exhibit large carbon and nitrogen abundances relative to iron, [C,N/Fe]& 1\n(Norris, Beers & Ryan 2000; Rossi, Beers & Sneden 1999). Many of these metal-poor\ncarbon/nitrogen enhanced stars also exhibit extremely high abundances of neutron-capture\nelements (Sneden et al. 1996; Bonifacio et al. 1998; Depagne et al. 2000; Sneden et\nal. 2000; Hill et al. 2000; Spite et al. 2000). Despite the fact that their evolutionary\nstatus is not completely known, many of them are certainly unevolved (or turn-off) stars\nfor which the hypothesis of internal pollution can be safely discarded (note that many of\nthese stars present Li abundances similar to those of the Spite plateau). One might think\nthat the entire CN-enhancement observed in these Population II stars is the result of the\nmass transfer across a binary system which formerly contained an AGB star (in fact, many\nof them present radial velocity variations); there are, however, several reasons for believing\nthat this might not always be the case. The fact that \u223c 25% of the most metal-deficient\nstars are CN-enhanced comprises a stringent requirement on the fraction of such systems\nthat form binaries with the right configuration for the mass transfer to occur. Furthermore,\nnot all of these stars present abundance patterns with the s-process elements thought to\noccur in AGB companions. The abundance patterns in these stars might well be content\nthe key to understanding the nucleosynthetic processes in the very early Galaxy before\nthese extremely metal-deficient stars formed.\n\n3.\n\nThe IMF for Population III stars\n\nThe issue of the IMF for the first generation of stars has received particular attention\n(see e.g. Matsuda, Sato & Takeda 1969; Carberlg 1981; Silk 1983). Since metals are the\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nmost important coolants in present-day star formation, these studies have emphasized the\nimportance of the radiative cooling by H-based molecules because the primordial gas was\ndeficient in heavy elements. Current models predict that the first bound systems capable\nof forming stars appeared in the history of the universe at redshifts between 50 and 10 and\nhad masses between 105 and 108 M\u2299 (see e.g Miralda-Escud\u00e9 2000). Depending mainly on\nthe ratio between the time scale for radiative cooling and heating due to the gravitational\ncollapse, these structures could further fragment into clumps with smaller masses. These\nsimulations show that typical fragmentation into clumps occurs with masses in the range\n102 -103 M\u2299 , but due to the relatively low resolution used in these studies, there is no\nclear consensus on whether these structures can fragment into still smaller mass clumps.\nThis controversy seems to originate from oversimplified assumptions like a homogeneous,\npressure-less and/or spherical collapse. The minimum mass fragment that could form is of\nspecial relevance because of the feedback effects. If the typical protostar fragment formed\nhad a large mass (\u223c 102 M\u2299 ), its high luminosity would contribute to the rapid heating of\nthe collapsing clump, inhibiting further fragmentation. Additionally, the final fate of these\nhigh mass objects would probably be a very energetic phenomenon (SNII-like or hypernova\nexplosion). The large energy deposited in the gas during this event could be large enough\nto completely disrupt the clump, again avoiding further star formation. Thus, the typical\nmass of the collapsed fragment not only determines the IMF but also the period of time\nduring which the first star formation episode occurred.\nIn this respect, Uehara, Susa & Nishi (1996) set a minimum fragment mass at about\nthe Chandrasekhar mass (> 1.4 M\u2299 ). This is an important result because it implies that\nwe should see no metal-free stars at the present time, since all of these stars should by\nnow have evolved. Yoshii & Saio (1986), based on the opacity-limited fragmentation\ntheory, derive an IMF that is steeper in the high stellar mass range than a Salpeter-like\nIMF; the exact slope, however, critically depends on the mass-luminosity relation assumed\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nfor the zero-metal protostars. An interesting result from the Yoshii & Saio calculations is\nthat the IMF derived would have a maximum around the intermediate stellar mass range\n(3-8 M\u2299 ). Very recently, Nakamura & Umemura (2000) performed multi-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations of the collapse and fragmentation of filamentary primordial\nclouds. These simulations show that, depending upon the initial density of the cloud, the\nIMF for Population III stars is likely to be bimodal. Gas filaments with initial densities\nlower than \u223c 105 cm\u22123 tend to fragment into structures with masses larger than several\ntens of M\u2299 (\u223c 102 M\u2299 ), while initially denser filaments (n & 105 cm\u22123 ) experiment more\neffective H2 cooling and fragment into structures of \u223c 1 \u2212 2 M\u2299 . The relative peaks of this\nbimodal IMF would be a function of the collapse epoch in such a way that during the first\nepoch the dominant peak would be around 2 M\u2299 , while as the star formation proceeds and\nthe collapsing clump heats up, the Jeans mass would be displaced to larger masses, moving\nthe peak to \u223c 102 M\u2299 .\nThe above mentioned studies basically compile the proposed IMFs for Population\nIII stars in the literature. In summary: i) there are physical arguments for assuming\nthat the slope of the present IMF has changed in time, ii) the first star-forming clouds\ntypically fragmented into massive clumps of 102 \u2212 103 M\u2299 , iii) there exists the possibility\nof further fragmentation into smaller masses, producing an IMF peaking at about the\nintermediate stellar mass range. Support to these facts hasbeen recently given by Hernandez\n& Ferrara (2001). In the framework of the standard hierarchical clustering scenario of\ngalaxy formation, these authors show that the IMF of the first stars was increasingly high\nmass biassed towards high redshifts: at z \u223c 9 the charactheristic stellar mass being 10-15\nM\u2299 . Therefore, we will restrict our analysis to the IMFs that cover the above properties.\nIn fact, we use the IMFs proposed by Yoshii & Saio, referring to them as YSa if a relation\nmass-luminosity in the form L(m) \u221d (m/M\u2299 )\u03b2 with \u03b2 = 1.5 is adopted, or YSb if \u03b2 = 3.\nWe also use the bimodal IMF proposed by Nakamura & Umemura and, in a similar way, we\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nconsider two cases, depending on the position of the peaks: NUa if the peak at low stellar\nmass is the dominant one or NUb if the peak at large mass dominates. For comparison, we\ncontrast the results with those obtained from the canonical Salpeter (1955) IMF. Figure\n1 shows the IMFs used in the mass range 1-103 M\u2299 , and clearly demonstrates how these\nIMFs differ 3 .\n\n4.\n\nThe stellar yields\n\nRecent theoretical analysis of the evolution of Population III stars predicts that the\nfate of metal-free stars can be classified as follows: (1) Stars with initial mass m & 250 M\u2299\ncollapse to a black hole (BH) with no metal ejection (Ober, El Eid & Fricke 1983; Heger et\nal. 2000). (2) Stars in the mass range 100 . m/M\u2299 . 250, usually termed very massive\nobjects (VMO), are disrupted by electron-positron pair instability leading to a type II\nsupernova-like event (pair creation supernovae, PCSN) and eject metals leaving no compact\nremnant behind. (3) Stars with initial mass in the range 40 . m/M\u2299 . 100 probably\ncollapse into a BH without metal contribution (Woosley & Waever 1995, but see below).\n(4) Stars in the range 10 . m/M\u2299 . 40 give a type II supernova (SNII) event (Woosley &\nWeaver 1995; Limongi, Chieffi & Straniero 2001; Limongi, Straniero & Chieffi 2000) and\nfinally. (5) Stars with initial mass m & 1 M\u2299 and lower than the minimum mass for carbon\nignition (\u223c 8 M\u2299 ) will pass through the AGB phase (Fujimoto, Ikeda & Iben 2000; Chieffi\net al. 2001) leaving a white dwarf (WD) as the stellar remnant.\n3\n\nThe IMFs are normalized as\n\nR mup\n\nmlow\n\n\u03c6(m)dm \u2261 1, where mup and mlow are the upper and\n\nthe lower stellar mass limit, respectively. Note that the upper limit varies depending upon\nthe IMF adopted. From the Uehara, Susa & Nishi (1996) results we have adopted mlow = 1\nM\u2299 in all the IMFs.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nThe nucleosynthesis products from intermediate mass stars (IMS) (1.5 . m/M\u2299 . 8)\nare of special interest here since the IMF for Population III stars might peak in this\nmass range. Note that a star with initial mass around 7-8 M\u2299 has a lifetime (\u223c 107 yr)\nonly slightly larger than that of a typical SNII progenitor and therefore will contribute\nto IGM enrichment shortly afterwards. Due to the peculiarity of the Z = 0 stellar\nevolution, appropriate yields are highly necessary. Previous calculations of the stellar yields\nin metal-poor IMS were obtained from stellar models with no primordial composition,\nZ \u223c 10\u22124 Z\u2299 (Marigo, Bressan & Chiosi 1998; Van den Hoek & Groenewegen 1997).\nMoreover, these yields were obtained from synthetic approximations after the end of\nHe-burning without having taken into account the evolution during the TP-AGB phase.\nIn fact, the existence of third dredge-up (TDU) episodes and thermal pulses (TP) in this\nphase plays a crucial role in determining the stellar yields from IMS. Recently, Chieffi et\nal. (2001) performed a detailed analysis of the evolution of zero metal IMS. Using the\nevolutionary code FRANEC (Chieffi, Limongi & Straniero 1998) these authors found, at\nvariance with previous studies, that these stars do experience TP during the AGB phase.\nAs a consequence, TDU episodes occur and the stellar envelope may be enriched with fresh\n12\n\nC, 14 N and 16 O during this phase. The most important result from this study is that these\n\nstars become C-rich (i.e. carbon stars) and N-rich and can eject important amounts of these\nelements at the end of their evolution. The yields from these stars are, however, sensitive\nto the modeling of the mass-loss rate during the AGB phase. In fact, it is the mass-loss\nrate that finally determines the duration of the AGB phase since it limits the number of\nTPs and, therefore, the number of TDU episodes. Both mass loss and dredge up efficiency\ncould be deduced by the observed properties of the disk AGB population, but little is\nknown of these phenomena in very metal-poor stars. We note, however, that the increase\nof the heavy elements in the envelope, caused by the TDU in Population III AGB stars,\ncould reduce the difference with respect to the more metal-rich AGB stars. The yields of\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nintermediate mass stars shown in Figure 2 have been obtained by assuming a Reimers mass\nloss rate with \u03b7 = 4. This is considered a reasonable average mass loss rate for Population I\nintermediate mass AGB stars (see van den Hoeck & Gronewegen 1997). We emphasize that\nthe\n\n14\n\nN production from IMS is quite different from the value adopted here if a different\n\nvalue of \u03b7 is assumed. For example, assuming \u03b7 \u2248 1 the\n\n14\n\nN yield decreases by a factor \u223c 3.\n\nOn the other hand, Chieffi et al. (2001) also show that in the most massive models (m > 4\nM\u2299 ), 7 Li can also be synthesized via hot bottom burning by the Cameron & Fowler (1971)\nmechanism in the same way as occurs in higher metallicity models (Sackmann & Boothroyd\n1992). The Li mass fraction in the envelope can reach peak values \u223c 10\u22128 , although the\nfinal Li yield would be lower than this value because of the progressive 3 He consumption\nand Li depletion at the base of the envelope during the AGB phase.\nConcerning the lowest mass range among IMS (1.5 . m/M\u2299 . 3), Fujimoto, Ikeda\n& Iben (2000) have shown that these stars develop TP and also become C and N-rich.\nUnfortunately, these authors did not compute yields from this mass range. However, we\nbelieve they can be omitted from our analysis, for the following reasons: i) Most studies\nof the fragmentation of primordial gas agree that objects with mass m < 2 M\u2299 are very\ndifficult to form. ii) We are mainly interested in the very early chemical enrichment of the\nIGM. Stars with m < 3 M\u2299 have a long lifetime and, if they formed, would only contribute\nat very late times in the chemical evolution of the IGM.\nThe adopted stellar yields for the mass range 10 . m/M\u2299 . 40 are taken from Limongi,\nStraniero & Chieffi (2000). These yields are based on presupernova evolutions computed\nwith the FRANEC code plus a simulated explosion based on the radiation dominated shock\napproximation (Weaver & Woosley 1980). The location of the mass cut has been chosen\nby requiring that \u223c 0.05 M\u2299 of\n\n56\n\nNi are ejected by each stellar model. This amount of Ni is\n\nvery similar to that used to explain the observational properties of the SN 1987A. Let us\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nremind that since the location of the mass cut is still theoretically very uncertain, the yields\nof the elements mainly produced at the bottom of the mantle will largely depend on the\nadopted mass cut. If the ejected amount of\n\n56\n\nNi ranges between \u223c 0.001 and \u223c 0.2 M\u2299 , the\n\nmass cut remains confined within the region exposed to the complete explosive Si burning\nand hence only the elements produced in this region, i.e., iron, cobalt and nickel, would be\nsignificantly modified by changing the mass cut location (see Limongi, Chieffi & Straniero\n2001). On the contrary, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen yields, which are synthesized in a\nmore external layer of the star, where the modifications induced by the explosive burning\nare less important, are more robust. Obviously, the abundance ratios of any element with\nrespect to Fe in the ejected matter vary according to the assumed ejected mass of iron. It\nis important to emphasize that the yields used here in the mass range 3 . m/M\u2299 . 40 are\ncomputed in a homogeneous and consistent way. On the other hand, the final fate of stars\nin the mass range 40-100 M\u2299 is highly uncertain because it is not clear if they collapse to\na black hole or not. Woosley & Weaver (1995) (see their Figure 7) found that zero metal\nstars reach the moment of the final core collapse with a structure much more compact than\nthat of more metal rich ones. Hence, they found that stars more massive than about 40\nM\u2299 should collapse into a BH under the assumption that the energy delivered to the star\nafter the bounce does not significantly depend on the initial mass. In this first study we\nadopt this scenario while in a forthcoming one we will investigate how the results change by\nassuming that also stars more massive than 40 M\u2299 contribute to the chemical enrichment\nof the intergalactic medium.\nUnfortunately we do not yet have stellar yields computed in the same way from the\nFRANEC code for VMOs. As far as we know, the only complete set of stellar yields\navailable in the literature for VMOs are those of Ober, El Eid & Fricke (1983). These\nauthors performed full evolutionary calculations of zero-metal stars with initial mass in the\nrange 100 . m/M\u2299 . 250 and computed the nucleosynthetic products due to incomplete\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\noxygen burning in PCSN. One of the most interesting results from these computations is\nthat few or no iron-peak elements (50 < A < 60) are produced in the PCSN process. This\nresult contrasts, however, with the more recent calculations of Arnett (1996) and Heger et\nal. (2000). Arnett (1996) studied the explosion of very massive CO cores of different mass\nand found that important quantities of iron-peak elements can be ejected, depending again\non the mass-cut position. Computations by Heger et al. (2000) in a \u223c 70 M\u2299 CO core\n(corresponding to a star of initial mass \u223c 150 M\u2299 ) produce the same figure. Nevertheless,\nwe have compared the stellar yields computed by Ober, El Eid & Fricke (1983) with those\nby Arnett (1996) and Heger et al. (2000) for the same CO core model and found an\nexcellent agreement (differences less than a factor of 2) except, as mentioned previously, for\nthe iron-peak elements. Because of the high uncertainty related to the iron yield in VMOs,\nwe decided to adopt that of Arnett (1996). We note that theoretical interpretations of the\nelement ratios (in particular the low Ba abundances and the high dispersion in the [Ba/Fe]\nratio) found in the most metal-poor stars of our galaxy (McWilliam et al. 1995; Sneden\net al. 1998), might indicate that a source other than SNII must exist to produce the Fe\nobserved at [Fe/H]\u2264 \u22123. Wasserburg & Qian (2000a) attribute this source to the first\nVMOs formed from the Big Bang debris.\nFigure 3 shows the yields of the significant elements finally adopted in the stellar mass\nrange computed by us.\n\n5.\n\nChemical evolution calculations\n\nIn this section we apply the computed yields and the IMFs proposed for the zero-metal\nstars to study the early chemical enrichment of the IGM by means of two different and\nsimple approaches. In both approaches we consider the entire universe at high redshift as\na one-zone system where the gas exists in a homogeneous chemical phase. From this gas\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nwith primordial composition, Population III stars form whether isolated, or within dense\nclouds with mass 105 \u2212 108 M\u2299 (see \u00a71). In any case, we assume that the outflow from\nthe Population III stars is instantly and evenly mixed with the primordial IGM gas. More\nrealistic models describing the mechanisms from which material processed in stars formed\nin primordial clouds is injected and mixed into the IGM, are discussed in Ferrara, Pettini\n& Shchekinov (2000); Madau, Ferrara & Rees (2000). This is, however, beyond the scope\nof the present paper.\nFirst, we consider a single burst of star formation. In this approach the stellar ejecta is\nincorporated instantaneously into the IGM and there is no further episode of star formation,\ni.e.: the ejecta are not incorporated into any second generation of stars. The second case\nis a simple chemical evolution model where the stellar lifetimes are considered explicitly.\nThe model is evolved for 108 yr in time steps of 105 yr to resolve the small lifetimes of the\nVMOs, starting at the onset of the Population III star formation. This allow us to clearly\ndistinguish between the role played by VMO, massive stars and IMS respectively, in the\npollution of the IGM along the evolving cosmic time. Note that a time \u223c 108 yr is roughly\nthe lifetime of a zero-metal star of 3-4 M\u2299 . Although in this second approach several\ngenerations of stars are created, and the ejecta of one generation is mixed into the next\ngeneration of stars, the evolution time considered in the model is short enough to minimize\nthis effect (see below). To give some numbers, placing the very first star formation episode\nat redshift z \u223c 10 \u2212 20 in a universe with \u03a9 = \u03a9M + \u03a9\u039b = 1 and Ho = 65 km/s/Mpc, a time\ninterval \u2206t \u223c 108 yr corresponds to a redshift z \u223c 8.5 \u2212 15, respectively. For comparison,\nz \u223c 3 which is assumed to be the epoch of galaxy formation, corresponds to \u2206t \u223c 2 \u00d7 109\nyr after the Big Bang.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n5.1.\n\nThe burst model\n\nTo compute the chemical enrichment of the IGM due to a single burst of star formation\nwe proceed as usual. Initially all the baryons in the universe are in gaseous form with\na comoving density \u03c1b . During the star burst a fraction p \u2261 \u03c1\u2217 /\u03c1b (where p is the star\nformation efficiency) goes into stars. Once the generation of stars have died, a fraction R\nof their mass is returned into the IGM as processed gas. This fraction is\n\nR=\n\nZ\n\nmup\n\n\u03c6(m)Rej (m)dm\n\n(1)\n\n1\n\nwhere Rej (m) is the mass fraction of a star of mass m ejected when the star dies. This\nfraction varies depending on the adopted IMF, \u03c6(m): 0.67, 0.86, 0.82, 0.4 and 0.45 for the\nSalpeter, YSa, YSb, NUa, NUb IMFs, respectively. The choice of the IMF also determines\nthe upper mass limit mup (see Figure 1). It is easy to show that the comoving density of\nthe gas after the burst is given by\n\n\u03c1gas = \u03c1b \u2212 (1 \u2212 R)p\u03c1b\n\n(2)\n\nOn the other hand, if the initial gas density of each isotope is given by \u03c1oi = \u03c1b Xio ,\nwhere Xio is its primordial abundance in mass fraction, the density of a given isotope after\nthe burst is\n\n\u03c1i = \u03c1oi \u2212 \u03c1\u2217 Xio + \u03c1eject\ni\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c1eject\nis the gas density of the specific isotope in the material ejected by the\ni\ngeneration of stars. We thus define the enrichment of the IGM in the isotope i as\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\u2206Xi =\n\n\u03c1i\n\u2212 Xio\n\u03c1gas\n\n(4)\n\nFor isotopes with no primordial composition Xio = 0. After some simple algebra from\nequations (2) and (3), the chemical enrichment can be written.\n\n\u2206Xi =\n\np\n(yi \u2212 Xio )\n[1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 R)p]\n\n(5)\n\nwhere yi is the stellar yield defined as the mass fraction of the total mass returned by\na generation of stars in the form of the isotope i.\nThe results from the combined effect of the stellar yields and IMFs for Population\nIII are summarized in Table 1. The second column gives the total metallicity Z reached\nin the material ejected by the star burst (i.e., without considering the dilution with the\nmetal-free IGM gas) relative to the solar metallicity (Z\u2299 = 0.0189). Column three shows\nthe maximum efficient factor p allowable for each IMF so as not to surpass the maximum\nmetallicity observed in the Ly-\u03b1 forest, Z \u223c 4 \u00d7 10\u22123 Z\u2299 . Note that quite low values of p are\nallowed for all the IMFs. The most restrictive p values are those obtained for the NUa &\nNUb IMFs because of the high metal pollution from VMOs (Z/Z\u2299 > 1, see column two)4 .\nThese low values of p contrast with the current estimate of the efficient factor in regions\nof star formation in the Galaxy, p . 10\u22122 , or in other spiral galaxies (Kennicutt 1998).\nHowever, for any IMF choice in Table 1 the corresponding p factor is large enough for the\n4\n\nAs mentioned in \u00a72, the metallicity measured in the Ly-\u03b1 forest systems is uncertain\n\nand may well be lower limits. In such a case, the values of p in Table 1 should be considered\nalso as lower limits. In fact, Hernandez & Ferrara (2001) and Ciardi et al. (2000), estimate\nslightly larger values of p than those in Table 1 from different analyses, which would be in\nagreement with this figure.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nPopulation III to have played an important role in the reionization of the universe before\nz \u223c 6 \u2212 7 (see e.g. Bromm, Kurdritzki & Loeb 2000).\nWe can also use the star burst model to estimate the contribution of the stellar\nremnants from Population III to the baryonic matter density. It is a simple matter to show\nthat the comoving density of stellar remnants \u03c1sr is related to the baryonic density by\n\n\u03c1sr = (1 \u2212 R)p\u03c1b\n\n(6)\n\nThen, if we use \u03a9sr to describe the density of stellar remnants in units of the critical\ndensity (\u03c1crit = 2.77 \u00d7 1011 h2 M\u2299 Mpc\u22123 ),\n\n\u03a9sr = (1 \u2212 R)p\u03a9b\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03a9b is the baryonic density in units of the critical one. In column four of Table\n1 we show \u03a9sr derived from equation (7), the corresponding p value compatible with the\nmetallicity limit requirement (see \u00a72), assuming \u03a9b = 0.019 and Ho = 65 km/s/Mpc. The\nvalues of \u03a9sr are quite low, representing only a very small fraction of \u03a9b for any IMF\nchoice (\u03a9sr /\u03a9b < 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 ). This can be seen more clearly in Figure 4, where we report\nthe abundance of C versus \u03a9sr obtained under different assumptions for the mass function\nfrom equation 5 (after a straightforward transformation). The two vertical lines bound the\nregion compatible with the baryonic mass budget implied by a Galactic halo interpretation\nof the LMC MACHO events (Fields, Freese, & Graff 1998), whereas the horizontal one\nindicates the abundance measured in the most metal-poor Lyman-\u03b1 forest system. Clearly,\nfor a \u03a9sr & 10\u22123 model predictions are far beyond of the observational limits for any\nmass function. The low values of \u03a9sr required for our analysis to be compatible with\nthe observational constraints are even more limiting than those imposed in other studies.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nFor instance, Madau & Pozzetti (2000) impose a limit from the observed extragalactic\nbackground light, \u03a9sr /\u03a9b < 5 \u00d7 10\u22122 . The strong limitation on \u03a9sr that we found here\ncoincides with the conclusion by Fields, Freese & Graft (2000) in a similar nucleosynthesis\nanalysis, i.e. that the contribution of the stellar remnants from an ancient generation of\nstars to the baryonic dark matter would have been insignificant.\nColumns 5 to 11 of Table 1 give the IGM abundances relative to the Solar System\nvalues (Anders & Grevesse 1988) for certain elements after the star burst. These abundance\nratios are computed from equation (5) using the corresponding efficient factor p (column\ntwo) for each IMF entry. Remarkably high [C,N/H] values result from the Salpeter, YSa\nand YSb IMFs, due to the large C and N production by zero metal IMS, which play\nan important role in these IMFs. In contrast, note the low [N/H] value obtained in the\nNakamura & Umemura cases. This is because the N yield from VMOs is very small.\nHowever, the [Fe/H] ratio obtained in the Nakamura & Umemura cases is large if Arnett's\n(1996) iron yield in VMOs is used. Si and Ca production is also important in these objects\nin such a way that [Si,Ca/Fe]& 0 although, [C,N,O,Mg/Fe]. 0. Of course, if the iron yield\nin VMOs from Ober, El Eid & Fricke (1983) is used, the [Fe/H] ratio from equation 5 in\nthe Nakamura & Umemura cases would be much lower ([Fe/H]\u223c \u22126) and, in consequence,\nextremely high [X/Fe] ratios are obtained for any chemical species in Table 1.\nObviously, the strongest constraints that can be imposed on the nature of the\nPopulation III IMFs come from the ratios between different elements. Unfortunately, the\nshortage of abundance measurements in Ly-\u03b1 forest systems still prevent us from drawing\nlimiting conclusions from the results in Table 1. Note in addition, that currently is still\nunder debate whether the abundances measured in the high redshiftz systems reprensent\nthe chemical imprint of the Population III stars or not (see \u00a72). Even if Population III\nstars existed, these abundances could have a nonnegligible contribution from non-zero\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nmetallicity stars. Having this in mind, from Table 1 we can see that the best IMF choice\ncompatible with the observational constraints discussed in \u00a72 would be that of YSa, i.e. an\nIMF peaked in the high mass range (5-7 M\u2299 ) of IMS, also including massive stars with\na Salpeter-like slope but without VMOs (see Figure 1). In this case [C/H]= \u22122.3 and\n[Si/H]= \u22122.4 are obtained, in full agreement with the single abundance measurement of\nthese elements in the Ly-\u03b1 forest systems. The large [C,N/Fe] ratios obtained with the YSa\nIMF are also compatible with the large C and N overabundances found in some extremely\nmetal-poor stars (see references in \u00a72). Furthermore, small overabundances of \u03b1-elements\n[O,Mg,Si,Ca/Fe] are also obtained with this IMF, of the order of those derived in damped\nLy-\u03b1 systems. In contrast, the [C,N/O]> 0 ratios obtained with an IMF that is heavily\nweighted in the IMS range (cases YSa and YSb mainly) contradict the abundance ratios\n([C,N/O]< 0) found in Population II stars [note however that the O abundance in these\nstars is still very controversial, see e.g. Boesgaard et al. (1999); Israelian et al. (2001)]. In\nthis respect it would be very interesting to derive O abundances in the Ly-\u03b1 forest systems\nand in the extremely metal-poor stars with large [C,N/Fe] ratios. This might determine\nwhether the IMS were present in the very first generation of stars.\nFinally, the last column of Table 1 shows the Li abundance by number (Li/H) expected\nin the material processed after the burst. Since the only evidence of a stellar production of\nLi comprises the high Li abundances measured in some AGB stars (Abia et al. 1991), we\nhave only considered the Li production by IMS, without taking into account the possible\nproduction by zero-metal SNII through the \u03bd-mechanism (Woosley & Weaver 1995). From\nTable 1 it is clear that no significant Li contribution from zero-metal IMS to that produced\nin the Big Bang is expected from any IMF choice. In fact, the Li enrichment \u2206X7 computed\nfrom equation (5) is negative for any value of p assuming X7o \u2248 10\u22129 .\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n5.2.\n\nThe evolutionary model\n\nWe have adopted the Abia, Isern & Canal (1995) chemical evolution package, in order\nto follow the evolution of some isotopes over time. Current knowledge of star formation\nhistory at very early epochs in the evolution of the universe is very limited (Steidel et al.\n1999; Madau et al. 1996; Hopkins, Connolly & Szalay 2000). The best estimate available\nat present indicates a roughly constant star formation activity between z \u223c 1 \u2212 4 but no\ndata exists for z > 5. Therefore, as it is usually done, we have assumed a star formation\nrate proportional to the comoving gas density \u03c8(t) = \u03b1\u03c1ngas (t), where \u03b1 = 2 Gyr\u22121 is the\nastration parameter and n = 1. Note that the computed abundance ratios [X/Y] are nearly\ninsensitive to the adopted star formation rate but they do depend upon the stellar yields\nand on the IMF adopted. In fact, parallel calculations with other \u03b1 and n values were made\nto ensure that our calculations were not dependent upon these parameters. As mentioned\npreviously, we have followed the evolution of the abundance ratios for 108 yr from the\nonset of the primordial star formation. We have not considered the role played by type Ia\nsupernovae since these objects are usually thought to come from longer lifetime progenitors\n5\n\n. In any case, decisions regarding of the IMF and the law for the star formation rate have,\n\nhowever, important consequences for the present-day type Ia SN rate (see Canal, Isern &\nRuiz-Lapuente 1997). The stellar lifetimes have been obtained by means of the same models\nused to derive the stellar yields. The computed stellar models extend from the pre-main\nsequence until the thermally pulsing AGB phase for the IMS, or until the Si-melting in\nthe massive star range. For VMOs we have extrapolated our numerical lifetime-stellar\nmass relation to the corresponding mass range. For example, the lifetimes of stars with\ninitial masses of 4, 25 and 120 M\u2299 are 114, 7.8 and 1 Myr, respectively. Due to the very\n5\n\nThis is not strictly true in the case of a Red Giant accreting mass on a WD generated\n\nby an intermediate mass progenitors.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nshort lifetimes of massive stars and VMOs, several generations of these stars would form\nduring our adopted evolution time (108 yr). Because of the progressive pollution of the\nIGM, the subsequent generations of stars would form with a non strictly zero metallicity.\nAlthough we also have yields for massive stars computed with the FRANEC code for\ndifferent metallicities, as far as we know there is no mention in the literature of this kind\nof computation for VMOs [setting aside the possibility that these objects may form with a\nnon-zero metallicity (see however Figer et al. 1998)]. Therefore, for the sake of homogeneity\nin our computations, we did not consider this effect, i.e. the metallicity dependent yields.\nWe believe nevertheless, that this inconsistency in the model would only have a minimal\neffect due to the very short time interval considered.\nIn Table 2 we show the total metallicity reached in the IGM for the different IMFs\nat several values of the cosmic time. We consider this metallicity as typical mean values\nsince at very early epochs the pollution of the IGM was very inhomogeneous, probably\noccurring through the mixing of cloud patches already contaminated with metals (Argast et\nal. 2000). We emphasize that the metallicity values in Table 2 are extremely dependent on\nthe star formation rate history assumed. What is important in Table 2 is the comparison\nbetween the results obtained with different IMFs at a given cosmic time. As expected from\nFigure 1, the evolution of the metallicity obtained in the Salpeter case is between that of\nthe YSa and YSb cases. Note the very low value of Z/Z\u2299 in the YSb case at log t= 6.5.\nThis is due to the steeper slope of this IMF for the high stellar mass range. In contrast,\nat log t\u223c 8 the YSa IMF presents an important degree of metal enrichment due to the\nsmoother than conventional slope of this IMF for the massive stars (see Figure 1). The high\nmetallicity value reached Z \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22122 Z\u2299 ([Fe/H]\u223c \u22121.7) at log t \u223c 8 in the YSa case is\nsimilar to that of the low metallicity tail in the metal distribution of thick disk stars in our\ngalaxy (Norris & Ryan 1991). For the Nakamura & Umemura IMF cases, the metallicity in\nthe IGM increases rapidly at very early times due to the contamination from massive stars\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nand VMOs, but the pollution is not as rapid at later times as that in the Salpeter and/or\nYoshii & Saio IMFs. This is due to the lesser importance of IMS which contribute at late\nin the two former IMFs. For the Salpeter, YSb and NUa cases a metallicity similar to that\nof the most metal-poor stars in our galaxy is achieved at log t\u223c 8: [Fe/H]\u2248 \u22122.5, \u22122.7\nand \u22123.0 are obtained, respectively. Interestingly, these values are of the order of those\npredicted in the prompt-enrichment model for the early galaxy proposed by Wasserburg &\nQian (2000a,b).\nFigure 5 shows the evolution in time of several abundance ratios for the different\nIMFs. We plotted the abundance ratios against the cosmic time instead of [Fe/H] as this\nabundance ratio is very dependent upon the model parameters. The abundance ratios\nobtained in our model for a time \u223c 108 yr after the onset of the Population III star\nformation, might be interpreted as those present in the more massive and denser collapsed\nstructures from which the present-day galaxies would have formed, i.e. the high redshift\ndamped Ly-\u03b1 systems (see \u00a72). From Figure 5 it can be seen that the evolutions of the\nabundance ratios computed in the Salpeter and YSa cases are almost equal. The sole\ndifference appears in the [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] ratios at late times due to the more important\ncontribution of IMS in the Salpeter case. For the YSa and Salpeter IMFs, overabundances\nof [C,N/Fe]& 0 are obtained at log t\u223c 8 as well as for the \u03b1-element ratios [O,Mg,Si,Ca/Fe].\nNote the sudden increase of the [N/Fe] ratio at log t\u223c 7.6 which indicates the onset of\nthe IMS contribution to the IGM metal enrichment. On the contrary, underabundances of\n[Mg,Si/Fe] are obtained with the YSb IMF. The reason for this is the steeper slope of this\nIMF in the mass range of the SNII progenitors from which these \u03b1-elements are produced.\nFrom the YSb IMF, however, a sharper increase of the [C,N,O/Fe] ratios at later times is\nobtained, which indicates the importance of the IMS contribution to CNO in this case (see\nFigure 1). In fact, [C,N/Fe]> 1 are obtained at log t> 7.6 for the YSb case\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nFor the Nakamura & Umemura cases, the evolutions of the abundance ratios are equal\n(see Figs. 5 and 6) thus, we have omitted the NUb case from these figures for the sake\nof clarity. However, the corresponding evolution of the absolute abundances are rather\ndifferent, as it can be seen in Table 2. Again, overabundances of \u03b1-elements are obtained\nfor any time6 . The evolution of the [C,N/Fe] ratio differs significantly with respect to that\nobtained from the Salpeter, YSa and YSb cases. At early times underabundances of C and\nN are predicted, in particular that of nitrogen. This is due to the very small yield of\n\n14\n\nN in\n\nzero metal VMOs. However, the large C and N overabundances at late times is again due\nto the production by IMS (see Figure 1). From Figure 5 it is obvious that the evolution of\nthe [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] ratios is dramatically affected by the yields from IMS for any IMF\nchoice. To emphasize the importance of the zero-metal IMS in the early enrichment of the\nIGM, in Figure 6 we have plotted the evolution of the CNO abundance ratios. Extreme\n[C/O] and [N/O] ratios result when an IMF that is heavily weighted around 2-4 M\u2299 is used\n(YSb, NUa and NUb cases). Note also the very low [N/O,C] ratios predicted at early times\nwhen the presence of VMOs is considered in the IMF.\nHow can the evolution of the abundance ratios in Figures 5 and 6 be related to\nobservations? If we consider only the abundance ratios obtained at log t\u223c 8, the abundance\nratio [Si/C]\u223c +0.2 measured toward the Ly-\u03b1 forest systems (Songaila 1997) would be in\nbetter agreement with a Salpeter IMF. A steeper slope in the mass range 10 . m/M\u2299 . 40,\nas in the YSb case, does not seem adequate. The presence of VMOs in the primordial IMF\nis also favored by this [Si/C] ratio provided that an important C production from IMS is\nexcluded. On the contrary, on the basis of the present yield calculations for zero-metal\nstars, the only way to obtain large [C,N/Fe]> 1 ratios is to accept an IMF peaking in the\n6\n\nNote that in the NUa and NUb cases the [Ca/Fe] evolution refers to the combined\n\nevolution of \u03b1-elements in the mass range 32 \u2264 A \u2264 40 (32 S,\n\n38\n\nK and\n\n40\n\nCa).\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nIMS range. An IMF of such a type could explain the high C and N abundance ratios found\nin a considerable number of extremely metal-poor stars. This, however, would imply high\n[C,N/O] ratios. Unfortunately, there exist no oxygen abundance determinations in these\nvery metal-poor stars to test this hypothesis. Note that in Population II halo stars with\n[Fe/H]< \u22121.5 the observed ratios are [C,N/O]\u223c \u22120.5 (Tomkin et al. 1992). Although the\nO abundances are also uncertain in these stars, these low [C,N/O] ratios would be against\nan IMF heavily weighted of intermediate mass stars. In this respect, our conclusions are\nsimilar to those reached by Gibson & Mould (1997) using Z \u223c 10\u22124 Z\u2299 stellar yields for\nIMS. On the other hand, the [O/Fe] ratios derived in the most metal-poor stars in our\nGalaxy certainly put interesting constraints on the very early chemical evolution. With the\nyields for zero-metal stars used here, we did not find ratios [O/Fe]& 1 as derived in several\nrecent studies (Abia & Rebolo 1989; Israelian, Garc\u0131\u0301a-L\u00f3pez & Rebolo 1998; Boesgaard\net al. 1999; Israelian et al. 2001; Mishenina et al. 2000) for any IMF. However, taking\ninto account the uncertainty in the iron yield from massive and very massive stars (see \u00a74),\nit is indeed possible to obtain [O/Fe]> 1 or higher at very early times by decreasing the\niron yield from these stars with respect to that adopted here, by only a factor of four. The\npresent uncertainty on the iron yield from these stars, allows such a variation.\n\n6.\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nWe have studied the chemical constraints imposed on the existence of a pregalactic\ngeneration of stars (Population III) by the recent abundance determinations in high redshift\nsystems and in extremely metal-poor stars in our Galaxy. Using yields computed from\nstellar models (3 . m/M\u2299 . 200) of strictly zero metal content, we have shown that a\nchemical enrichment to the level observed in the high redshift intergalactic medium can\nbe easily obtained from a stellar pregalactic nucleosynthesis. We merely have to postulate\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\n(see Table 1) that a small fraction (p < 10\u22122) of primordial matter has participated in\nthe Population III stars. As a consequence, this low pregalactic star formation efficiency\nstrongly limits the contribution of the stellar remnants from Population III to the baryonic\nmatter. We found \u03a9sr < 10\u22123 \u03a9b for all of the IMFs tested. However, the present scarcity\nof abundance data in the high redshift universe (which are of controversial interpretation)\ndoes not yet permit us to strongly limit the IMFs currently proposed for Population III:\nbasically, an IMF peaking in the intermediate stellar mass range (3 . m/M\u2299 . 8) or an\nIMF including very massive objects (m & 100 M\u2299 ). Nevertheless, at the present state of the\nart on stellar nucleosynthesis models, the very large C and N enhancement ([C,N/Fe]> 1)\nfound in a significant fraction of the extremely metal-poor stars in our Galaxy favors a\nPopulation III IMF peaked at intermediate mass stars. However, as it has also been shown\nby previous studies (Gibson & Mould 1997; Fields, Freese & Graft 2000), this inevitably\nleads to a pollution of the halo ISM at the levels of [C,N/O]> 0.5, which seems rather\ndifficult considering the observed [C,N/O] abundance pattern in Population II halo dwarfs.\nWithout doubt, further abundance studies in high redshift systems, in particular\nin Lyman\u2212\u03b1 forest systems with decreasing hydrogen column density, and in extremely\nmetal-poor stars will soon resolve the question of the existence of Population III and the\nnature of its mass function.\n\nThis work has been partially supported by the grants PB96-1428, AYA2000-1574 and\nthe Italy-Spain agreement HI1998-0095, the PNIE, the CIRIT and the italian grant COFIN\n2000.\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nAbia, C., & Rebolo, R. 1989, ApJ, 347, 186\nAbia, C., Boffin, H.M.J., Isern, J., Rebolo, R. 1991, A&A, 245, L1\nAbia, C., Isern, J. & Canal, R. 1995, A&A, 298, 465\nAlcock, C. et al.
