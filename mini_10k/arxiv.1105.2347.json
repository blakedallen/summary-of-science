Many properties, such as the pseudogap, are strongly dependent on doping and on the position\non the Fermi surface. One can attempt to describe the crucial effect of the strong electron-electron interactions by a\nfrequency and momentum dependent electronic self-energy.\nAngle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) [1]\nhas been used to deduce various forms for the self-energy [2\u2013\n5] including that of the marginal Fermi liquid phenomenology\n[6]. However, this approach implicitly assumes the existence\nof quasi-particles and the associated analytic structure of the\none electron Green's function, which Anderson has contested\nand proposed an alternative \"Hidden Fermi\" liquid (HFL) theory [7].\nIn this Letter, we consider a model self-energy motivated\nby Angle-Dependent Magneto-Resistance (ADMR) experiments [8\u201310] and consisting of two terms with distinctly different dependencies on frequency, momentum, and temperature. The first term is that of a Fermi liquid (FL) and is\nisotropic on the Fermi surface. The second term, which we\ndenote as an anisotropic marginal Fermi liquid (AMFL) has\nthe same frequency and temperature dependence as that of\na marginal Fermi liquid, is anisotropic over the Fermi surface, and vanishes in the same directions as the superconducting gap and the pseudogap observed in underdoped cuprates.\nWe present a parametrization of this model self-energy which\ngives a consistent quantitative description of a wide range of\nexperimental results on overdoped Tl2201 materials, including ADMR, specific heat [11], de Haas-van Alphen [12, 13]\nand the quasi-particle dispersion near the Fermi surface measured by ARPES [14, 15]. In particular, we give a consistent description of the strongly doping dependent anisotropic\nscattering [9] and the almost doping independent specific heat\n[11]. This is possible because although the scattering can\nbe dominated by the AMFL term the quasi-particle renormalization is dominated by the FL term. We compare our\nparametrization of the self-energy with the results of different\nmicroscopic theories [16\u201319] based on Hubbard and t \u2212 J\nmodels.

(color online) Strong doping dependence of the normal\nstate anisotropic scattering rate in an overdoped cuprate superconductor. The scattering rate and its anisotropy are those deduced from\nthe angular dependent magnetoresistance (ADMR) for Tl2201 at 40\nK [9]. The isotropic scattering rate \u03b3iso (points and dashed line),\nwhich is constant on the Fermi surface, shows negligible doping dependence. In contrast, the anisotropic scattering rate \u03b3aniso (squares\nand full line), which is maximal in the antinodal direction and zero in\nthe nodal direction, depends strongly on doping. The doping dependence of \u03b3aniso follows the superconducting transition temperature Tc\n(dotted line) in this overdoped regime [9, 10]. The scattering rates\nare shown in units of \u03c9c0 \u2243 1 meV, the cyclotron frequency at the\nmagnetic field at which the measurements were made.\n\nIs there a consistent phenomenology of the experiments?\nFor overdoped materials ADMR provides a complementary\nprobe to ARPES, measuring the Fermi surface (FS) and the\nquasi-particle (QP) lifetime [8\u201310] at different points of the\nFS. Two scattering channels are observed, one has a quadratic\ntemperature (T ) dependence and is approximately constant\nwith doping, while the second is approximately linear in T ,\nanisotropic over the FS [8], and strongly increases with decreasing doping, as optimal doping (p \u2243 0.16) is approached\n\n\f2\n\n\u03a3(k, \u03c9) = \u03a3FL (\u03c9) + \u03a3AMFL (k, \u03c9).\n\n(1)\n\nThe detailed functional form is given in the Supplementary\nmaterial. As suggested by the isotropic and \u221d T 2 scattering\nrate in ADMR [8, 9] we take the FL self-energy isotropic. The\nAMFL part of the self-energy depends on \u03c6 [4] (azimuthal\nangle of the Fermi wave vector kF on a 2D FS) and we assume\nthat it is responsible for the anisotropic and T -linear part of\nthe scattering deduced from ADMR [8].\nRenormalization of the bare-band mass mb is determined\nby 1 \u2212 \u2202\u03a3\u2032 (\u03c6, \u03c9)/\u2202\u03c9|\u03c9=0 , which for our model self-energy\ngives [24],\n4 s\n\u03c9\u2217\nm\u2217 (\u03c6)\n= Z(\u03c6)\u22121 = 1 +\n+ \u03bb(\u03c6) ln( AMFL ),\n\u2217\nmb\n\u03c0 \u03c9FL\n\u03c0T\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Z(\u03c6) is the QP weight at angle \u03c6. s parametrizes the\nstrength of the electron-electron scattering associated with the\n\u2217\nFL term, \u03c9FL\nis the FL high frequency cutoff, \u03bb(\u03c6) is a \u03c6 de\u2217\npendent dimensionless AMFL coupling constant, and \u03c9AMFL\nis the AMFL high frequency cutoff. We use units ~ = kB = 1.\nIn general there is also a contribution to the renormalization\nfrom \u2202\u03a3/\u2202k\u22a5 where k\u22a5 is a momentum perpendicular to the\nFS. We assume this contribution is negligible [24].\nParametrization of model self-energy. In the Supplement\nwe estimate the parameters in Eq. (2) from the ADMR results\n\u2217\nand show that s/\u03c9FL\n> \u03bb(\u03c6) and that \u03bb(\u03c6) vanishes in the\nnodal direction. Together this leads to a relatively small effect\nof the AMFL part of the self-energy on the mass renormaliza\u22172\ntion. Briefly, the isotropic T 2 term gives s/\u03c9FL\n\u2243 9.2(eV)\u22121 .\nThe term linear in T gives the strength of the AMFL selfenergy and its \u03c6 dependence [9],\n\u03bb(\u03c6) = 1.6 cos2 (2\u03c6)Tc (p)/Tcmax ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the doping dependence is encoded via the relation between Tc and p [24]. This expression for \u03bb(\u03c6) explicitly takes\n\ninto account that the AMFL self-energy is largest in the antinodal direction, zero in the nodal direction [8, 10] and that it\nscales with Tc in the highly overdoped regime [9]. The Fermi\n\u2217\nliquid cutoff \u03c9FL\n\u2243 0.23 eV is estimated from measurements\nof CV in the strongly overdoped regime with Tc = 0 which\ngive m\u2217 /me = 4.8 \u00b1 0.8 [11].

Information\non the self-energy is also provided through the renormalization of quasi-particle energies suggested by specific heat CV\nmeasurements [11], ARPES determination of Fermi velocity\n[21], de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) measurements of the renormalized cyclotron mass [12, 13] and the optical effective mass\ndetermined from the Drude weight in the frequency dependent conductivity [22]. All of these suggest a weak doping\ndependence of the real part of the self-energy, in contrast to\nthe strongly increasing anisotropic scattering rate \u03b3aniso with\ndecreasing doping shown in Fig. 1. This raises a question\nabout consistency because the quasi-particle renormalization\nand scattering rate are not independent of one another, being\nrelated to the real and imaginary part of the self-energy, respectively. The two parts are related via the Kramers-Kronig\nrelation. Indeed, this relationship is the origin of the unified\npicture of the Kadowaki-Woods ratio in Fermi liquids [23].\nModel self-energy. Following the temperature dependence\nand anisotropy of the scattering rate determined by ADMR we\nconsider a self-energy consisting of FL and AMFL contributions\n\n0\n0.28\n\nFigure 2.

Our\nestimates are within the measured uncertainties of CV , which shows\nthat strongly doping dependent ADMR scattering rates and doping independent CV can be consistently described. The Brinkman\nand Rice result [25] is shown with a dash-dotted line and the hidden FL result [20] is shown with a double-dotted line. The density\nof states is normalised to that for free electrons in two dimensions\n\u03bdfree (0) = 4\u03c0me .\n\nRenormalization factor. Fig. 2 shows the calculated density of states at the Fermi energy \u03bd(0) as a function of doping\n\u2217\nfor various \u03c9AMFL\ntogether with values deduced from specific\nheat and de Haas-van Alphen experiments. For the calculation\nof \u03bd(0) one evaluates the band mass mb (or strictly the band\ndensity of states at the Fermi energy) from the bare-band dispersion \u01eb0k , which is approximated with a tight-binding model\nfit to the LDA bands (Eq. (S7) in Supplemental material\n[24]). It is evident from Fig. 2, that although the scattering\nrate of QP in the antinodal direction (or AMFL part of selfenergy) strongly increases with decreasing doping, the density\nof states (and CV ) stays rather constant and is only mildly af\u2217\nfected by the AMFL self-energy for all \u03c9AMFL\n. 0.4 eV.

The results are within measured uncer\u2217\ntainty for any \u03c9AMFL\n. 0.5 eV which is comparable to previous estimates from ARPES, \u223c 0.2 eV - 0.4 eV [4], \u223c 0.1\neV [3], and \u223c 0.4 eV - 0.5 eV within the isotropic MFL phenomenology [5, 26]. From the above analysis it is evident that\nnot only small \u03c9 properties are relevant, but also the highenergy cutoffs. These may be reflected as kinks or waterfalls\nin the QP dispersion [5, 27, 28].\nRenormalized QP dispersion. Our renormalized dispersion\nis also in good agreement with the ARPES QP dispersion\n[14, 15] near (\u03c0, 0) (see Fig. 3a), if a small correction of\nfixing the non-interacting FS to the one measured in ARPES\n[14] is taken into account by applying a bare-band shift of\n(0.17 cos(4\u03c6) \u2212 0.1 cos(8\u03c6)) eV. The agreement in the nodal\ndirection near the FS is satisfactory, but near the (0, 0) point\n\u2217\nwe observe the waterfall due to the sharp cutoff at \u03c9FL\n(Fig.\n\u2032\n3b). The waterfall arises due to \u2202\u03a3 /\u2202\u03c9 becoming & 1 in the\n\u2217\nvicinity of a high frequency cutoff \u03c9FL\n(for example see Fig.\n1 in Ref. [5]). This results in a sharp drop of the QP disper\u2217\nsion and in a broader spectra at \u03c9 \u223c \u03c9FL\n.

The agreement with the measured\nARPES QP dispersion [14] (dashed line) is very good near van Hove\nsingularity and at the FS in the nodal direction (b). Some discrepancy\nis found at the band bottom, where we observe a waterfall originating\n\u2217\nfrom \u03c9FL\n. The bare-band dispersion is shown with the dotted line.\n\nOur estimate of \u03bb for the overdoped regime is in satisfactory\nagreement with the values estimated from ARPES, although\nsome differences are still present [24]. The ARPES estimate\nfor the QP lifetime on the FS [14] in Tl2201 is an order of\nmagnitude larger than that from ADMR, and has the opposite angular dependence. This would imply that the renormalization of the effective mass and CV would be one order of\nmagnitude larger, unless the scattering is elastic or some other\neffects, e.g., surface reconstruction, additionally broaden the\nARPES spectra.\n\nTo partially conclude, our model self-energy is capable\nof describing a range of experimental results, including the\nstrongly doping dependent ADMR scattering rate and almost\ndoping independent CV . Earlier it has been shown that the\nscattering rate deduced from ADMR can describe the temperature dependence of the intralayer resistitivity and Hall coefficient [8, 9]. Future studies should examine whether for overdoped cuprates this model self-energy can describe the optical conductivity, asymmetry of tunneling spectra, and ARPES\nenergy distribution curves, particularly since these have been\ninvoked as evidence for the Hidden Fermi liquid theory [7].\nMicroscopic theories. We now turn to possible microscopic\nexplanations of the self-energy and its dependence on \u03c6, T\nand p within the framework of strongly correlated electron lattice models. Fig. 3 illustrates the large difference between the\nbare-band dispersion and that observed by ARPES. They differ by a factor of about 4 due the QP renormalization from\nstrong electronic correlations. It is a challenge for microscopic theory to explain these large renormalizations in the\noverdoped region. Fig. 2 illustrates how the renormalization is\nlarger than the value (1 + p)/(2p) predicted by the BrinkmanRice theory [25]. However, it neglects the effect of the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction J. For small dopings this\nleads to an effective hopping of order J + pt [18, 29, 30],\nand so this significantly reduces the QP renormalization compared to the Brinkman-Rice picture (meaning the discrepancy\nshown in Fig. 2 will be even greater). In the cuprates it is estimated that J/t \u2243 0.3 [31] and so this can explain the weak\ndoping dependence of the renormalization, but not its large\nmagnitude.\nWe now compare the scattering rate with microscopic theories. First, a weak coupling treatment of the Hubbard model\nproduces an anisotropic scattering rate of similar frequency\nand angular dependence. The MFL component arises from a\nnesting of the Fermi surface in the anti-nodal regions [32] or\nfrom proximity to a van Hove singularity [32, 33]. However,\nfor the later case the resulting scattering rate would have opposite doping dependence and would appear only at higher T\nthan experimentaly observed for Tl2201. Furthermore, a functional renormalization group treatment of the Hubbard model\nshows scattering rates in qualitative agreement with ADMR\n[16]. However, we show in the Supplement that the calculated\nanisotropic scattering rate is an order of magnitude smaller\nthan in experiment [24]. Other microscopic model calculations also give a scattering rate similar to our model form, and\na quantitative comparison with our self-energy may rule out\nsome. Candidates include cluster dynamical mean-field theory [34], a large-N expansion treatment of the t-J model [18],\nthe quantum critical regime near a d wave Pomeranchuk instability [19], and d-wave superconducting fluctuations [35].\nHidden Fermi Liquid (HFL) theory. Anderson has argued\nthat the overdoped cuprates can be described in terms of a\nGutzwiller projected Fermi liquid which exhibits power law\nsingularities related to the X-ray edge problem [7]. Casey\nand Anderson calculated the scattering rate (see Eq. S10 in\nSupplement [24]) and compared it to ADMR data [17].

(color online) Hidden Fermi Liquid (HFL) theory cannot\ndescribe the temperature and doping dependence of the anisotropic\nscattering, \u03b3aniso . HFL predictions [17] for \u03b3aniso are compared with\nvalues deduced from ADMR data [9, 10] and to our anisotropic\nmarginal Fermi liquid (AMFL) parametrisation of the ADMR results. HFL predictions [17] for dopings corresponding to Tc = 16\nand 35 K are shown with dashed and double-dotted lines, respectively. HFL theory does not show any significant linear T dependence at low temperatures, unlike the measured data. (Full symbols\nare taken from Ref. [10], empty symbols are from Ref. [9]). Furthermore, HFL shows negligible doping dependence, unlike the significant doping dependence seen in the experimental data. Our AMFL\nparametrisation of the data is shown with dotted, full and dash-dotted\nlines. HFL results are obtained with vF (0)/vF (\u03c0/4) = 0.5 (as in\n[17]), which is kept constant with p.\n\never, the scattering rate in HFL [17] has a linear T dependence only for T & WHF L /2 \u223c 400 K [24], in strong contrast to the ADMR measurements [8], where the T linear term\nis observed even for T < 60 K (see Fig. 4 and Fig. S1 in\nSupplement [24]). WHF L is a HFL bandwidth [24]. Furthermore, they argue that the anisotropic scattering rate deduced\nfrom ADMR emerges solely as a consequence of anisotropy\nof the Fermi momentum and of the Fermi velocity on the FS\n[17, 20]. To obtain anisotropies comparable to ADMR Casey\nand Anderson require that vF (0)/vF (\u03c0/4) \u2243 0.5. We note that\nthe anisotropy in vF (\u03c6) found in LDA calculations is smaller\n(vF (0)/vF (\u03c0/4) \u2243 0.8 [14, 36]). In addition the LDA calculations show that this ratio increases with increasing doping due\nto approaching the van Hove singularity [36]. Hence, HFL\ntheory predicts a small increase in the ratio of anisotropic to\nisotropic scattering with increasing doping (this effect is not\ntaken into account in Fig. 4); the opposite trend is observed\nwith ADMR [9] (see Fig. 4 and S2). Furthermore, HFL predicts CV \u221d T /\u01eb0F with no renormalization effects [20], which\nis significantly smaller than experimental results for Tl2201\n(see Fig. 2) [37].\nIn conclusion, we have shown that it is possible to give\na consistent description of a wide range of experimental results for overdoped cuprates in terms of a model self-energy\nwhich contains an isotropic Fermi liquid contribution and an\n\nanisotropic marginal Fermi liquid contribution. The former is\ndoping independent and the latter increases significantly with\ndecreasing doping. This model self-energy is quantitatively\ninconsistent with some microscopic model calculations and\nprovides a explicit form against which other calculations can\nbe compared. The two distinct terms in the self-energy may\nhave two distinct physical origins. The isotropic Fermi liquid terms arises largely from local physics. The large on site\nCoulomb repulsion U reduces intersite hopping and leads to\nFermi liquid scattering of quasi-particles. Qualitatively, this\ncan be captured in a Brinkman-Rice picture and by Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT). In contrast, the anisotropic\nmarginal Fermi liquid term arises from non-local physics, and\nits physical origin is unclear. The relative importance of different types of fluctuations (antiferromagnetic, superconducting, or d-density wave), Fermi surface nesting and proximity\nto a quantum critical point is unclear.\nThis work shows that the overdoped curates are not simple Fermi liquids as has often been claimed. Instead they exhibit remnants of some the same physics present in the optimally doped materials (marginal Fermi liquid behaviour) and\nthe underdoped materials (cold spots and well-defined quasiparticles at the same Fermi surface points as the nodes in the\nsuperconducting gap and pseudogap). Thus, it seems that the\nchallenge of finding a successful microscopic theoretical description of the metallic phase of the cuprates is now extended\nto the overdoped regime.\nThis work was stimulated by discussions with N.E.

To evaluate the imaginary part \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c6, \u03c9 = 0) from Eq. (S5) the renormalization Z(\u03c6) should be known in advance, but this can be\navoided (see Eq. (S6) and the text above). The connection\nof the self-energy to the ADMR is given by \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c6, \u03c9 = 0) \u221d\n1/(\u03c9c (\u03c6)\u03c4 (\u03c6)), where the proportionality factor depends on\nbare-band Fermi velocity and Fermi wave vector, but is fairly\nconstant with \u03c6 (Eq. (S6)).\nThe main \u03c6, T and p dependencies of the self-energy\ncan be deduced from 1/\u03c9c(\u03c6)\u03c4 (\u03c6) (Eq. (S6)). Taking the\nmeasured temperature dependency of the QP lifetime [7, 8],\n1/\u03c9c(\u03c6)\u03c4 (\u03c6) = a + bT 2 + c(\u03c6)T , using the connection to\nthe self-energy, Eq. (S6), and comparing it with the model\nself-energy, Eq. (1) in the main text, the following estimates\nare obtained. From the T 2 term and the parameter b one can\n\u22172\nevaluate the strength of the FL self-energy part, s/\u03c9FL\n\u2243\n\u22121\n9.2(eV) . The term linear in T and c(\u03c6) gives the strength\nof the AMFL self-energy and its \u03c6 dependence, Eq. (3) in the\nmain text.\nTo calculate the density of QP states \u03bd(0) at the Fermi energy and the mass renormalization two additional parameters\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nare needed, the cutoffs \u03c9FL\nand \u03c9AMFL\n. \u03c9FL\ninfluences the\nrenormalization and the value of \u03bd(0) quite strongly (Eq. (2)\nin the main text) and can be estimated in the strongly overdoped regime with Tc = 0 from the CV measurements. Using\n\u2217\nm\u2217 /me = 4.8 \u00b1 0.8 [9] we estimate \u03c9FL\n\u2243 0.23 eV, in good\n\u2217\nagreement with the relation [10] \u03c9FL \u2243 1.6ZFL t1 \u2243 0.2 eV,\nwhere ZFL \u2243 mb /m\u2217 \u2243 0.3 (using mb /me \u2243 1.5 [11]).\n\u2217\nThe parameter \u03c9AMFL\nis in the argument of a logarithm in\nthe renormalization Eq. (2) in the main text and therefore does\nnot influence the renormalization considerably. Since it is observed that the QP density of states does not vary much as\ndoping is decreased from an overdoped regime towards opti\u2217\nmal doping [9], we can still try to set some limits on \u03c9AMFL\n.\n\nPARAMETRIZATION OF MODEL SELF-ENERGY\n\nWe estimate the parameters in Eqs. (S1) and (S3) from the\n\u2217\nADMR results and show that s/\u03c9FL\n> \u03bb(\u03c6) and that \u03bb(\u03c6)\nvanishes in the nodal direction. Together this leads to a relatively small effect of the AMFL part of the self-energy on\nthe mass renormalization (Eq. (2) in the main text). In order\nto parametrize the self-energy from the ADMR, which is predominantly measuring the lifetime \u03c4 (\u03c6) of QPs on the FS [6]\n(see Section Connection of the ADMR Scattering Rate and the\nSelf-energy) , we use the relation\n1\n= \u22122Z(\u03c6)\u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c6, \u03c9 = 0),\n\u03c4 (\u03c6)\n\n(S5)\n\nMOMENTUM DEPENDENCE OF THE CUTOFF\n\u2217\nFREQUENCY \u03c9AMFL\n\nARPES momentum distribution curves shown in Fig. 3\nof Ref. [4] suggest that the high frequency cutoff may be\n\u2217\n\u2217\nmomentum dependent, i.e., \u03c9AMFL\n= \u03c9AMFL\n(\u03c6). Similarly,\na \u03c6 dependent cutoff was observed by high-resolution laser\nARPES for slightly underdoped cuprate (see Fig. 5 and 7 in\n\u2217\nRef. [12]). In our analysis the \u03c6 dependency of \u03c9AMFL\nwould\nbe important only for \u03c6 for which the \u03bb(\u03c6) is large, i.e., in the\n\u2217\nantinodal direction. Our approximation of isotropic \u03c9AMFL\n\u2217\n\u2217\ncan therefore be viewed as \u03c9AMFL = \u03c9AMFL (0). On the other\n\n\f2\nhand, different cutoffs in momentum distribution curves may\nbe a consequence of a band dispersion as was shown in Ref.\n[13] (see Fig. 3), where an isotropic cutoff was used.\n\u2202\u03a3/\u2202k\u22a5 CONTRIBUTION TO THE RENORMALIZATION\n\nThe contribution of \u2202\u03a3/\u2202k\u22a5 to the renormalization is\nclaimed to be negligible according to Ref. [14] and large in\nunderdoped regime according to Ref. [15]. This contribution is finite for a self-energy, whose imaginary part is not an\neven function of \u03c9, since then \u2202\u03a3\u2032 (\u03c9 = 0)/\u2202k\u22a5 6= 0. Strong\nk\u22a5 dependency of the self-energy is also expected to change\nthe FS from the non-interacting one considerably, but it was\nshown that the deviations are fairly small at least in the overdoped regime (see Fig. 9 in Ref. [11]). The FS does not show\nany significant change of squareness [16] with doping, which\nwould signal the k\u22a5 renormalization from AMFL part of the\nself-energy. Hence, we assume that \u2202\u03a3/\u2202k\u22a5 contribution to\nthe renormalization is negligible.\nWithin our model, there is also no change of the FS from\nthe non-interacting one since \u03a3\u2032 (\u03c6, \u03c9 = 0) = 0 for any \u03c6,\nwhich is a consequence of \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c6, \u03c9) being an even function of\n\u03c9.\nCONNECTION OF THE ADMR SCATTERING RATE AND\nTHE SELF-ENERGY\n\nEq. (3) in the main text raises the question whether the\nlifetime measured in ADMR is not rather the transport lifetime 1/\u03c4tr , which does not include the contribution of small\nangle scattering, while the QP lifetime 1/\u03c4 does. More detailed analysis [6] shows that for B perpendicular to the layers\n1/\u03c4tr , while for B parallel to the layers 1/\u03c4 , should be used\nin a Boltzmann equation. However, for scattering from atomic\nscale defects 1/\u03c4tr and 1/\u03c4 differ by at most a factor of order\nunity and for scattering potential with short-range interlayer\ncorrelations 1/\u03c4tr \u2248 1/\u03c4 [6]. In this respect, Eq. (3) in the\nmain text is a good approximation to the connection between\nthe ADMR scattering rate and the self-energy. It is essentially the relaxation time approximation which is used in the\nanalysis of ADMR data, and can be derived for a Boltzmann\nequation [6, 17].\nTo avoid the factor Z(\u03c6) in calculation of \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c6, \u03c9 = 0)\nfrom the ADMR scattering rate, one can use the observation that in ADMR the product 1/\u03c9c (\u03c6)\u03c4 (\u03c6) is actually measured [16] and that the cyclotron frequency \u03c9c (\u03c6) \u221d vF (\u03c6) \u221d\nZ(\u03c6)vF0 (\u03c6), where vF (\u03c6) is the QP Fermi velocity and vF0 (\u03c6)\nis a bare-band Fermi velocity. Using this together with\n\u03c9c (\u03c6) = eBvF (\u03c6)*kF (\u03c6)/kF2 (\u03c6) [18] and expressing the selfenergy with the product 1/\u03c9c (\u03c6)\u03c4 (\u03c6) one obtains\n\u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c6, \u03c9 = 0) = \u2212\n\n1\neBvF0 (\u03c6) * kF (\u03c6)\n(\n),\n2\n2kF (\u03c6)\n\u03c9c (\u03c6)\u03c4 (\u03c6)\n\n(S6)\n\nwhere the factor Z(\u03c6) has canceled out. e is an electron\ncharge, B is the magnetic field used in the ADMR measurements and kF (\u03c6) is a Fermi wave vector measured from (\u03c0, \u03c0).\nComparison of the measured self-energy at \u03c9 = 0, Eq.\n(S6), and our model for the self-energy, Eq. (1) in main text,\nallows us to make quantitative estimates of parameters for the\nself-energy in the whole \u03c9 domain.\nBARE-BAND DISPERSION\n\nThe bare-band Fermi velocity vF0 (\u03c6) is evaluated from the\nbare-band dispersion [19]\n\u01eb0k = \u01eb0 \u2212 2t1 (cos kx + cos ky ) \u2212 4t2 cos kx cos ky\n\u22122t3 (cos 2kx + cos 2ky )\n\u22124t4 (cos 2kx cos ky + cos kx cos 2ky )\n\n\u22124t5 cos 2kx cos 2ky\n\u22122t6 (cos 3kx + cos 3ky ),\n\n(S7)\n\nwith parameters \u01eb0 = \u22121.598 , t1 = 0.438, t2 = \u22120.150,\nt3 = 0.084, t4 = \u22120.013, t5 = \u22120.020, t6 = 0.029, all\nexpressed in eV. These parameter values are taken to obtain a\ngood description of the LDA calculations presented in Fig. 7\nin Ref. [19]. For different doping levels we assume a rigid\nband shift and apply the corresponding chemical potential.\nThe Fermi wave vector kF (\u03c6) = k00 (p) \u2212 k40 cos 4\u03c6 [16]\nwith k00 (p) determined according to the Luttinger theorem\n\u03c0(k00 (p))2 /(2\u03c0/a0 )2 = (1 + p)/2, provided k40 \u226a k00 and\nas used in Ref. [16, 20]. k40 = 0.034 \u00c5\u22121 [8, 16] and lattice\nparameter a0 = 3.86 \u00c5. The measured kF (\u03c6) is in satisfactory\nagreement with the FS obtained from \u01eb0k above. The prefactor\nvF0 (\u03c6) * kF (\u03c6)/kF2 (\u03c6) in Eq. (S6), evaluated with the presented\nparameters and for the cases measured with ADMR [7, 8],\nshows less than 10% variation over the FS and can therefore\nbe to a good approximation treated as a constant.\nCORRECTION TO THE SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY CV\nFOR AMFL\n\nWhen calculating the density of states for AMFL and comparing it with the measured CV , one should be cautious. It is\nnot simply a matter of using the renormalized effective mass\nin a Fermi liquid expression for CV (T ). The temperature dependence of the thermodynamic potential \u03a9(T ) can be found\nfrom evaluating \u03a9(T ) from the Luttinger-Ward expression in\nterms of the one-electron Green's function [21]. This free energy \u03a9(T ) can be used to calculate the entropy and CV by\ndifferentiation with respect to T . This brings additional correction to the AMFL renormalization when dealing with CV ,\nsince the real part of AMFL self-energy has a logarithmic T\ndependence.\nThe isotropic marginal Fermi liquid expression for CV is\n\n\f3\n[22]\nCV \u2243\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\u03c9\n2 2\nMFL\n\u2212 1))T,\n\u03c0 \u03bdB (0)(1 + \u03bb(ln\n3\n\u03c0T\n\n(S8)\n\nwhere \u03bdB (0) is a bare band density of states, \u03bb is the coupling\nconstant and \u03c9MFL is a Marginal Fermi Liquid high frequency\ncutoff. The correction to the mass renormalization in Eq. (2)\nin the main text when dealing with CV is therefore to replace\n\u2217\n\u2217\nln(\u03c9AMFL\n/\u03c0T ) \u2192 (ln(\u03c9AMFL\n/\u03c0T ) \u2212 1). This correction is\nused in the calculation of \u03bd(0), plotted in Figure 2 in the main\ntext, which is mainly compared to CV measurements. However, the correction has no significant effect on the final results, particularly because the effective mass renormalisation\nis dominated by the isotropic Fermi liquid contribution.\n\nQUANTITATIVE COMPARISON WITH OSSADNIK ET AL.\n[28]\n\nRELATION BETWEEN Tc AND p\n\nThe relation between Tc and p used in Figs. 1 and 2 in the\nmain text is the parabolic universal phenomenological relation\n[23],\nTc (p)\n= 1 \u2212 82.6(p \u2212 0.16)2\nTcmax\n\n\u03bb, estimated from ADMR on a different material, is increasing with approaching optimal doping and reaches \u03bb \u223c 1.6\nthe agreement is satisfactory (see Eq. (3) in the main text).\nIn addition, small \u03bb \u223c 0.2 has been reported for overdoped\nBi(Pb)-2212 together with its increase with lowering doping\n[26], which is in good agreement with our estimate. However,\nARPES estimates for \u03bb(\u03c6) [4, 26] do not completely vanish\nin nodal direction, but still shows significant increase towards\nantinodal direction [4].\nOn the other hand, the ARPES observation of increasing\nQP lifetime towards the antinodal direction [25] in overdoped\nTl2201 could be the consequence of a SC phase [27], while\nin the normal state the QP lifetime could still be longer in the\nnodal direction.\n\n(S9)\n\nwith Tcmax = 93 K for Tl2201. This relation also gives the\ndoping dependence of \u03bb(\u03c6) in the AMFL self-energy via Tc\nin Eq. (3) in the main text. Including the observed deviation\nfrom the universal relation [24] would shift and stretch the\nvalues on the doping axis in Figs. 1 and 2 in the main text.\nFor example, the value of p at which Tc becomes non-zero\nwould be changed to 0.31, and the dHvA data in Fig. 2 in the\nmain text for Tc = 10 and 26 K would have the doping values\np = 0.30 and 0.27, respectively. However, for the simplicity\nwe use the usual phenomenological relation and note that the\nabove changes in the relation between Tc and p would not\nchange the overall results.\n\nCOMPARISON WITH ARPES SPECTRA: WATERFALL\n\u2217\nAND \u03c9FL\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe waterfall would diminish from our calculations, if in\nEq. (S1) for \u03a3\u2032\u2032FL (\u03c9) a stronger decrease for high \u03c9 is used,\nwhich would result in smaller FL renormalization in Eq. (S2),\n\u2217\nbut would in turn be compensated with larger \u03c9FL\n. This would\nmove the waterfall to higher frequencies or even diminish it\n\u2217\n\u2217\nfor large enough \u03c9FL\n. However, even for such \u03c9FL\n, our QP\ndispersion at the band bottom would be \u223c 50 meV lower than\nthe one in Ref [25].\nCOMPARISON WITH ARPES SPECTRA: DISCUSSION OF\nTHE AMFL COUPLING CONSTANT \u03bb\n\nOur estimate of \u03bb for the overdoped regime is smaller than\nthe values of \u03bb \u223c 1 \u2212 3 estimated from ARPES for optimally doped LSCO [4]. However, taking into account that our\n\nAs discussed in the main text a functional renormalisation\ngroup treatment of the Hubbard model gives an anisotropic\nscattering rate which has qualitatively the same temperature\nand doping dependence as the experiments [28].\nOur estimates from ADMR for the term linear in T in the\nQP lifetime are 0.4T , 2.5T , 4T , for dopings p = 0.30, 0.22,\nand 0.15, respectively. These values should be compared with\nthe values of 0.012T , 0.09T and 0.2T obtained by Ossadnik\net al. [28]\nOn the other hand, the prefactor in the T 2 term in the selfenergy obtained in Ref. [28] is of the same order of magnitude\nas ours, provided a value is used for the nearest neighbour\nhopping t1 \u2243 0.44 eV, consistent with LDA calculations [19],\nrather than the smaller one (0.18 eV) used in Ref. [28].\nHIDDEN FERMI LIQUID THEORY\n\nCasey and Anderson argue that at a point on the Fermi surface and at temperature T the scattering rate is [29]\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n2\u03c0p\u2032 ~ kF (\u03c6)\n=\n\u03c9c \u03c4 (\u03c6, T )\neB\nvF (\u03c6)\nT2\nih\ni (S10)\nh\n\u00d7\n(\u03c0,\u03c0)\nvF (\u03c6)\n(\u03c6)\nT + 2\u03c0p\u2032 WHF L kkFF(\u03c0/4)\nvF (\u03c0/4)\n\nwhere the HFL bandwidth WHF L = \u01ebF (2p/(1 + p))2 and\np\u2032 = (1 \u2212 p)2 /4.\nAll the parameters we use in Figure 4 of the main text and in\nFigure S1 and S2 here are the same as those used by Casey and\nAnderson [29]. They compared the above equation with experimental data for a single doping and used the same vertical\nscale as in Figure S1 (top). There is then no clear discrepancy\nbetween the data and HFL theory. However, Figure 4 in the\nmain text uses an expanded vertical scale and shows experimental data for a range of dopings. The experimental data is\ninconsistent with HFL theory.\n\n\f4\n6\nHFL\nAMFL\n\n\u03b3aniso\n\nIn Figure S2 we explicitly show the measured doping dependence of anisotropic and isotropic scatterings and compare\nthem with the HFL theory and our AMFL form. One can\nsee that the HFL theory predicts a much weaker doping dependence of the anisotropic scattering than is observed, while\nit captures the observed negligible doping dependence of the\nisotropic scattering.\n\n3\n\nT=40K\n\n0\n\n25\n\n0\n\nHFL (Tc=16K)\nHFL (Tc=35K)\nAMFL (Tc=16K)\nAMFL (Tc=20K)\nAMFL (Tc=35K)\n\n\u03b3aniso\n\n15\n\nTc [K]\n\n20\n\nTc [K]\n\n40\n\n6\nHFL\nAMFL\n\n\u03b3iso\n\n20\n\n20\n\n3\n\n10\nTl2201-17K\nTl2201-17K\nTl2201-20K\nTl2201-20K\nTl2201-35K\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n40\n\n80\n\n120\n\n160\n\nT=40K\n\n0\n\n40\n\n200\n\nT [K]\n\nFigure S2.

[29].\nBottom: Both HFL theory [29] and our AMFL form can successfully describe the measured isotropic scattering rate \u03b3iso [8, 16]. Full\nsquares and dashed line reproduce the plot in Fig. 2 in Ref. [29].\n\nand decreasing FL part of self-energy as optimal doping is approached from the overdoped side [4], since this should result\nin decrease of CV .\nHowever, the MFL renormalization can still be the only and\nsufficient source of the renormalization, if \u03bb is non-zero on the\n\u2217\nwhole FS and larger \u03c9MFL\nare used, e.g., average \u03bb \u223c 1.7 and\n\u2217\n\u03c9MFL\n\u223c 0.4 eV used for optimally doped LSCO [13]. In the\nunderdoped regime, CV shows a reduction [30], which is believed to be a consequence of the emerging pseudogap. In this\nLetter we are, however, using a QP picture, which becomes\nquestionable as optimal doping is approached.\nEq. (2) in the main text shows that the AMFL renormalization logarithmically decreases with increasing temperature\nT , while the FL renormalization is fairly constant. Therefore\nthe T dependence of CV might prove useful for extracting\nthe two contributions in the overdoped regime of high-Tc superconductors, especially, if the AMFL renormalization dominates [13]. Experimental uncertainties and T ranges seem to\ncurrently be insufficient for making such an analysis [30].\n\nFURTHER DISCUSSION\n\nWe have shown that the renormalization coming from the\nAMFL part of the self-energy influences the CV only weakly\nand that the main source of renormalization comes from FL\npart of the self-energy. This sheds doubts on a purely AMFL\nself-energy as well as on the picture of increasing AMFL part\n\n[1] K. Miyake, T. Matsuura, C. Varma, Solid State Comm. 71, 1149\n(1989).\n[2] A.C. Jacko, J.O.
