It is\nproven then that there exist no odd perfect numbers.\n\nMSC Class: 11D61, 11K65\n\n\f1. Introduction\nWhile even perfect numbers were known to be given by 2p\u22121 (2p \u2212 1), for 2p \u2212 1 prime,\nthe universality of this result led to the the problem of characterizing any other possible\ntypes of perfect numbers. It was suggested initially by Descartes that it was not likely that\nodd integers could be perfect numbers [12]. After the work of de Bessy [3], Euler proved\nP\n= 2, where \u03c3(N ) =\nd is the sum-of-divisors function,\nthat the condition \u03c3(N)\nd|N\nN\nd integer\n\nrestricted odd integers to have the form (4k + 1)4m+1 q12\u03b11 ...ql2\u03b1l , with 4k + 1, q1 , ..., ql\nprime [13], and further, that there might exist no set of prime bases such that the perfect\nnumber condition was satisfied.\n\nInvestigations of the equation for the sum of the reciprocals of the divisors of N has\nled to lower bounds on the number of distinct prime divisors. This number has increased\nfrom four to nine [17][27][33] while a minimum of 75 total prime factors [19] has been\nestablished. When 3 6| N , it was shown that there would be a minimum of twelve different\nprime divisors [18][24]. It was demonstrated also that, if 3, 5, 7 6| N , greater than 26\ndistinct prime factors would be required [7][28]. In decreasing order, the three largest\nprime divisors were bounded below by 108 +7 [15], 104 +7 [20] and 102 +1 [21] respectively,\nwhile the least prime divisor had to be less than 2n+6\nfor n different prime factors [16] and\n3\n10\nexp(4.97401 \u00d7 10 ) [34]. Moreover, either one of the prime powers, (4k + 1)4m+1 or qi2\u03b1i\nfor some index i, was found to be larger than 1020 [10]. Through the algorithms defined\nby the sum over reciprocals of the divisors, it has been demonstrated that odd perfect\nnumbers had to be greater than 10300 [6].\nOne of the possible methods of proof of the odd perfect number conjecture is based\non the harmonic mean H(N ) = P\u03c4 (N) 1 , where \u03c4 (N ) is the number of integer divisors of\nd|N d\n\nN . It has been conjectured that H(N ) is not integer when n is odd [30]. This statement\nalso would imply the nonexistence of odd perfect numbers as the perfect number condition\nP\nis d|N d1 = 2 and \u03c4 (N ) must be even, since N is not a perfect square. The use of the\nharmonic mean leads again to the study of the sum of the reciprocals of the divisors, and\nthe values of this sum have only been approximated. For example, it has been found that\n\u2212 2 < 10\u221212 [23].\nthere are odd integer with five different prime factors such that \u03c3(N)\nN\n\nThe uniqueness of the prime decomposition of an integer allows for the comparison\nbetween its magnitude and the sum of the divisors. Since the sum of the divisors of an odd\n2\u03b1 +1\n4m+2\nQl\nQl\nqi i \u22121\n2\u03b1i\nby the product (4k+1)4k \u22121\ninteger N = (4k + 1)4m+1\ni=1 qi\ni=1\nqi \u22121 , it is\nsufficient to determine the properties of the prime factors of the repunits\nto establish that\n\u0014\np\nQl\nthere exist no odd perfect numbers. The irrationality of 2(4k + 1) \u03c3((4k+1)4m+1 )* i=1\n1\n\n\f\u03c3(qi2\u03b1i )\n\n\u0015 21\n\nwould imply that \u03c3(N ) cannot equal 2N . It has been proven for a large class\n\nof primes {4k + 1; qi } and exponents {4m + 1; 2\u03b1i } that the rationality condition is not\nsatisfied. The irrationality of the square root of the product of 2(4k + 1) and the sequence\nof repunits is not valid for all sets of primes and exponents, however, and it is verified in\n\u00a74 that the rationality condition holds for twelve odd integers. The factorizations of these\nintegers have the property that the repunits have prime divisors which form interlocking\nrings, whereas, in general, the sequence of prime factors does not close. The presence of\na sequence of primes of increasing magnitude prevents any finite odd integer from being a\nperfect number. To prove that \u03c3(N)\n6= 2, it is necessary also to obtain a lower bound for\nN\nq n \u22121\nthe number of prime divisors in \u03c3(N ). Since the number of distinct prime factors of qii \u22121\nis minimized in the class of repunits with exponents containing the prime divisor p when\nn = p, the exponent is presumed to be prime throughout the discussion. It is demonstrated\nin Theorem 1 that any pair of repunits, with prime bases and exponents satisfying a given\ninequality, do not have identical sets of prime divisors. Then, either \u03c3(N ) has an excess\nof prime divisors or constraints must be imposed on {4k + 1; qi } and {4m + 1; 2\u03b1i } which\nhave no integer solution. The non-existence of odd perfect numbers also follows from the\nsequence of prime factors of increasing magnitude in the factorization of \u03c3(N ), when one of\nthree specified relations is satisfied, and constraints on the basis and exponents otherwise.\n2. The Existence of Different Prime Divisors in the Repunit Factors of the\nSum of Divisors\nTo prove the nonexistence of odd perfect numbers, it shall be demonstrated the product\nof repunits in the expression for \u03c3(N ) contains an excess of prime divisors of \u03c3(N ), such\nthat the perfect number condition \u03c3(N ) = 2N cannot be satisfied.

Furthermore, the integers sets {1, 2, ..., 2\u03b1i}\nand {1, 2, ..., 2\u03b1j } are used entirely in the products to give the same integer, which must\nthen be a prime. The existence of solutions to the inequalities 1 < (qi \u2212 1)2\u03b1i < 32\u03b1i\n\nimplies that these bounds do not exclude the equality of\n2\u03b1j + 1, qi , 2\u03b1i + 1.\n\n22\u03b1j +1 \u22121\nqj \u22121\n\nand\n\n2\u03b1i +1\n\u22121\n\nqi\n\nqi \u22121\n\nfor some\n\nIf the primes which divide only qi2\u03b1i +1 \u2212 1, are factors of qi \u2212 1 or qj \u2212 1, they would be\npartially cancelled in a comparison of\n\n2\u03b1i +1\n\u22121\n\nqi\n\nqi \u22121\n\n2\u03b1j +1\n\nand\n\nqj\n\n\u22121\nqj \u22121 .\n\nAny divisor of qi \u2212 1 which\n\n2\u03b1 +1\nqi i \u22121\n\nis a factor of qi \u22121 also must divide 2\u03b1i + 1.

The conditions with \u03bd = \u03bd1 = \u03bd2 = 1 follow if different\n\npowers of the other primes do not arise. However, qip \u2212 1 \u2261 0 (mod p\u03bd ) only if qip \u2212 1 \u2261\n0 (mod p), and since qip \u2212 q \u2261 0 (mod p), this is possible when p|qi \u2212 1.

It follows that either 2\u03b1i + 1 or 2\u03b1j + 1 is\na prime which divides only one of the repunits.\nFurthermore, qi \u2212 1 and qj \u2212 1 are integers which are not rescaled, such that distinct\nprime divisors arise in the products of the remaining linear factors. If the exponents 2\u03b1i +1\nand 2\u03b1j + 1 are unequal, they represent factors which do not divide both repunits. When\nthe exponents 2\u03b1i + 1 and 2\u03b1j + 1 are equal, it would be necessary for nij to be equal to\nq\n\n2\u03b1i +1\n\u22121\n\nq\n\n2\u03b1j +1\n\n\u22121\n\none, which is not feasible since qi 6= qj . It follows also that i qi \u22121 and j qj \u22121 cannot\nbe equal, and the original assumption of their inequality is valid. However, by the first\ntwo relations in Eq.(2.23), there exists a prime which is not a divisor of both repunits.\n\nExample 2.\nAn example of congruence with more than one solution less than P is\n(2\u03b1i + 1)2\u03b1i (2\u03b1i \u2212 1) 2 (2\u03b1i + 1)2\u03b1i (2\u03b1i \u2212 1)(2\u03b1i \u2212 2) 3\nx +\nx\n3!\n4!\n(2\u03b1i + 1)2\u03b1i (2\u03b1i \u2212 1)(2\u03b1i \u2212 2)(2\u03b1i \u2212 3) 4\n+\nx = 0 (mod 11)\n5!\n(2.24)\nwhich is solved by x = 2, 4 when 2\u03b1i + 1 = 5. This is consistent with the inequality (2.6),\n5\n5\nsince \u01eb = 0.074897796 when x0 = 2. Consequently, 3 2\u22121 = 11 * 11 and 5 4\u22121 = 11 * 71 both\n5\nhave the divisor 11 and the distinct prime divisor arises in the larger repunit.

For example, the sum of divisors of\n\n\u03c3(375 32 52 292 792 832 1372 2832 3132 ) = 2*37*34 *74 *132 *192 *312 *432 *672 *732 *1812 *3672 (4.3)\n\nsuch that new prime factors 7, 13, 19, 31, 43, 67, 73, 181, 367 are introduced. The inclusion\nof these prime factors in the integer N leads to yet additional primes, and then the lack of\nclosure of the set of prime factors renders it impossible for them to be paired to give even\npowers in \u03c3(N ) with the exception of 2(4k + 1).\nIt may be noted that the decompositions of repunits with prime bases of comparable\nmagnitude and exponent 6 include factors that are too large and cannot be matched easily\nwith factors of other repunits. It also can be established that repunits with prime bases\nand other exponents do not have square-free factors that can be easily matched to provide\n13\n\n\fa closed sequence of such pairings. This can be ascertained from the partial list\n55 \u2212 1\n= 781\n4\nU6 (6, 5) = 3906 = 2 * 7 * 31 * 32\nU5 (6, 5) =\n\nU5 (8, 7) = 2801\nU5 (12, 11) = 16105\nU5 (14, 13) = 30941\n\n(4.4)\n\nU5 (18, 17) = 88741\nU7 (4, 3) = 1093\nU7 (6, 5) = 19531\nU9 (4, 3) = 9841\nU3 (32, 31) = 993 = 3 * 331\nThe entire set of integers satisfying the rationality condition is therefore restricted to a\nring of prime bases and powers and exponents 4m + 1 = 5, 2\u03b1i = 1 with a given set of\nprime factors occurring in the sum-of-divisors function.\nThe first prime of the form 4k + 1 which arises as a coefficient D in the equality\nq3 \u2212 1\n= Dy 2\nq\u22121\n\n(4.5)\n\nq prime\n4m+2\n\nis 3541. This prime is too large to be the basis for the factor (4k+1)4k \u22121 , since it\nwould give rise to many other unmatched prime factors in the product of repunits and\nthe rationality condition would not be satisfied. Amongst the coefficients D which are\ncomposite, the least integer with a prime divisor of the form 4k + 1 is 183, obtained when\nq = 13. However, the repunit with base 61 still gives rise to factors which cannot be\nmatched since\n616 \u2212 1\n= 858672906 = 2 * 3 * 7 * 13 * 31 * 97 * 523\n(4.6)\n60\nTherefore, the rationality condition provides confirmation of the nonexistence of odd perfect numbers, which, however, can be proven with certainty only through the methods\ndescribed in this work.\n5. On the Non-Existence of Coefficients of Repunits satisfying the\nPerfect Number Condition\n\nBased on Theorem 1, it is proven that additional prime divisors arise in the sumof-divisors function and a relation equivalent to the perfect number condition cannot be\n14\n\n\fsatisfied by the primes 4k + 1 and qi , i = 1, ..., l.\nTheorem 2.
