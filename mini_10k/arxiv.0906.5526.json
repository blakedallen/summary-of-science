We calculate the masses of the Higgs bosons at the one-loop level. We\nalso calculate at the one-loop level the gluon-involving processes for the productions\nand decays of the scalar Higgs bosons of the model at the energy of the CERN\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC), where the radiative corrections due to the loops of\ntop, bottom, and exotic quarks and their scalar partners are taken into account.\nWe find that the exotic quark and exotic scalar quarks in the model may manifest\nthemselves at the LHC, since the production of the heaviest scalar Higgs boson via\ngluon fusion processes is mediated virtually by the loops of exotic quark and exotic\nscalar quarks, for a reasonable parameter set of the model.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe search for the Higgs boson is one of the prominent goals of the future high-energy\ncollider experiments. The massive fermions and gauge bosons in the standard model\n(SM) acquire their masses through the mediation of a single scalar Higgs boson. The\nmass of this SM Higgs boson receives quadratic divergences at the one-loop level due to\nthe radiative corrections from other SM particle loops. The simplest way to solve this\nproblem is to introduce the supersymmetry (SUSY) to the SM. The SUSY partners to\nthe SM particles help to eliminate the quadratic divergences to the Higgs boson mass,\nby the cancellation between each SM particle loop and its superparticle loop, at the oneloop level. However, if the SUSY is a broken symmetry in nature, the cancelation is not\ncomplete and thus the Higgs boson mass receives non-zero quantum corrections at the\none-loop level [1-4].\nThe most economical SUSY model is the minimal supersymmetric standard model\n(MSSM), where two Higgs doublets are introduced in order to cancel the gauge anomaly.\n1\n\n\fThey give masses independently to down-type fermions and up-type fermions. Since\nstudies of the MSSM has revealed a few theoretical problems such as the \u03bc problem [5],\nvarious alternative SUSY models have been introduced.\nThe U(1)-extended supersymmetric standard model (USSM) is one of the non-minimal\nsupersymmetric models which does not suffer the MSSM \u03bc problem. The USSM is characterized by the extra U(1)\u2032 gauge symmetry at the TeV scale [6-23]. Thus, there is an\nextra neutral gauge boson with a mass of a TeV scale. Also, the USSM has a larger Higgs\nsector, which consists of a neutral Higgs singlet besides two Higgs doublets. In the USSM,\nthe quantity corresponding to the \u03bc parameter of the MSSM is dynamically generated by\nthe vacuum expectation value of the Higgs singlet.\nAnother characteristic of the USSM is that each SM generation is extended by an extra\nl\npair of SU(2) singlet quarks, DLl and D\u0304R\n, with electric charges \u22121/3 and +1/3, respectively. The presence of these exotic quarks is interesting from the phenomenological point\nof view. In particular, scenarios with a light exotic quark in the USSM have extensively\nbeen investigated [18-22]. A recent study have shown that the exotic quarks may contribute by large amount to the CP mixing between the heaviest scalar and pseudoscalar\nHiggs bosons [18]. Since the exotic quarks couple directly to the neutral Higgs singlet,\nthe heaviest Higgs boson mass at the one-loop level might be affected by the exotic quark\nloops. Also, the exotic quark loops contribute to the gluon fusion process of the Higgs\nproduction at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These effects of the exotic quarks have\nbeen studied elsewhere [22]. While some approximations have been made in Ref. [22],\nthe calculations in this article are carried out in a rigorous way.\nIn this article, we continue to study the Higgs potential in the USSM at the one-loop\nlevel. In particular, we are interested in the Higgs productions and decays at the LHC.\nWe take into account the radiative corrections due to the quarks of the third generation,\nexotic quarks, and their superpartners at the leading order. We calculate the production\ncross sections of the scalar Higgs bosons via the gluon fusion process. It is found that\nthe production of the heaviest scalar Higgs boson might be significantly enhanced for a\nparameter region by the exotic quark and scalar quarks contributions.\nWe also study the dominant decay modes of the scalar Higgs bosons. Among them,\nwe calculate the decay processes of the scalar Higgs bosons into gluon pairs, which are\nmediated by the loops of the quarks, exotic quarks, and their superpartners. The gluonic\ndecay mode might be important for the Higgs search of the USSM at the LHC, since it\nmay exhibit the role of the exotic quark and exotic scalar quarks. In particular, we find\nthat the decay of the heaviest scalar Higgs boson into a pair of gluons depends virtually\nonly on the loops of the exotic quark and exotic scalar quarks.\nThe article is organized as follows: In the next section, the Higgs potential of the\nUSSM is described. Then, we calculate the masses of the pseudoscalar and the three\nneutral scalar Higgs bosons at the one-loop level. These one-loop masses are taken as\ninput for the Higgs production calculations in Section 4 and the Higgs decay calculations\nin Section 5. Numerical analysis is presented in Section 6, and conclusions in the last\nsection.\n\n2\n\n\f2.\n\nHiggs Potential\n\nThere are two Higgs doublet superfields H1 and H2 , and a Higgs singlet superfield S in\nthe USSM. The gauge symmetry of the USSM is SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) \u00d7 U(1)\u2032 . For the Higgs\nsuperpotential, we consider only the quarks of the third generation, and one family of the\nexotic quarks, DL and D\u0304R . Thus, the superpotential of the USSM may be written as\nW \u2248 ht QT \u01ebH2 tcR \u2212 hb QT \u01ebH1 bcR + hk SDL D\u0304R + \u03bbSH1T \u01ebH2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ht , hb , and hk are the Yukawa couplings of the top, bottom, and exotic quarks,\nrespectively, Q is the left-handed quark doublet superfield of the third generation, tcR and\nbcR are respectively the charge conjugate superfields of the right-handed top quark and\nthe right-handed bottom quark, \u03bb is the dimensionless coupling constant, and \u01eb is a 2 \u00d7 2\nantisymmetric matrix defined as \u01eb12 = 1.\nThe Higgs sector of the USSM consists of two Higgs doublets, H1 = (H10 , H \u2212 ) and\nH2 = (H + , H20 ), and one Higgs singlet S. The tree-level Higgs potential, V 0 , is obtained by\ncollecting the F -terms and the D-terms of the above superpotential, and adding physically\nallowed soft terms. Thus, it may be written as\nV 0 = VF + VD + VS ,\n\n(2)\n\nwith\nVF = |\u03bb|2[(|H1 |2 + |H2 |2 )|S|2 + |H1T \u01ebH2 |2 ] ,\ng2\ng2\nVD = 2 (H1\u2020~\u03c3 H1 + H2\u2020~\u03c3 H2 )2 + 1 (|H1 |2 \u2212 |H2 |2 )2\n8 \u2032\n8\ng12\n+\n(Q\u03031 |H1 |2 + Q\u03032 |H2 |2 + Q\u03033 |S|2 )2 ,\n2\nVS = m21 |H1 |2 + m22 |H2 |2 + m23 |S|2 \u2212 [\u03bbA\u03bb H1T \u01ebH2 S + H.c.] ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere g2 , g1 , and g1\u2032 are respectively the gauge coupling coefficients of SU(2), U(1),\nand U(1)\u2032 , ~\u03c3 are Pauli matrices, A\u03bb is the trilinear soft SUSY breaking parameter with\nmass dimension, mi (i = 1,2,3) are soft SUSY breaking masses, and Q\u03031 , Q\u03032 , and Q\u03033 are\nrespectively the effective U(1)\u2032 hypercharges of H1 , H2 , and S. We do not consider in\nthis article the CP violation in the USSM, which may take place in the mixing between\nthe scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs bosons. Thus, the parameters of the Higgs potential\nas well as the vacuum expectation values of the neutral Higgs fields are taken to be real\nin following procedure.\nThe effective U(1)\u2032 hypercharges of the Higgs fields satisfy the identity relation of\nP3\n\u2032\ni=1 Q\u0303i = 0 in order to ensure the U(1) gauge invariance. The soft SUSY breaking masses\nmi may be eliminated by using the three minimum conditions for the Higgs potential\nthat define the vacuum. After electroweak symmetry breaking, the neutral components\nof Higgs fields will develop vacuum expectation values as v1 = hH10 i, v2 =qhH20 i, and\ns = hSi. We introduce a free parameter, tan \u03b2 = v2 /v1 . The value of v = v12 + v22 is\nfixed by electroweak data as 175 GeV. In terms of the vacuum expectation values, the\nmasses of top, bottom, and exotic quarks are respectively given as mt = ht v2 , mb = hb v1 ,\nand mk = hk s after electroweak symmetry breaking.\n3\n\n\fThe tree-level 2 \u00d7 2 mass matrices for the scalar partners to top, bottom, and exotic\nquarks in the USSM may be written as\nq\u0303\nq\u0303\nM11\nM12\nq\u0303\u2217\nq\u0303\nM12\nM22\n\nq\u0303\n\nM =\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere q\u0303 = t\u0303, b\u0303, k\u0303. For simplicity, we rewrite Mijq\u0303 as Mijt\u0303 , Mijb\u0303 , and Mijk\u0303 , respectively, for\nthe scalar partners to top, bottom, and exotic quarks.

These relations for\nthe effective U(1)\u2032 hypercharges are dictated by the cancellation of anomalies. Note that\nthe contributions from VD are included in the above mass matrices for the scalar quarks.\nIn Ref. [22], they have been neglected.

The contributions from the loops of top quark and top scalar\nquarks are most dominant for a wide region in the parameter space. Also, the radiative\n5\n\n\fcorrections due to the loops of bottom quark and bottom scalar quarks might be phenomenologically significant, especially for very large tan \u03b2, at the low energy scale. The\ncontributions from the loops of the exotic quark and its scalar partners in the USSM are\nnot well studied. We have suggested elsewhere that their contributions are worthwhile\nstudying from a phenomenological point of view because the exotic quark couples directly\nto the Higgs singlet S in the USSM [22]. Thus, in this article, we consider the loops of\ntop, bottom, exotic quark and their scalar partners in our calculations at the one-loop\nlevel.\nThe Higgs potential at the one-loop level, V 1 , is given as\nV 1 = V 0 + V1,ef f\nwhere the radiative corrections, V1,ef f , is obtained by effective potential method [24].\nExplicitly, it is given by\nV1,ef f =\n\nX\nj\n\nnj M4j\nM2j\n3\nlog\n\u2212\n2\n2\n64\u03c0\n\u039b\n2\n\"\n\n#\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u039b is the renormalization scale in the modified minimal subtraction scheme, and\nnq = \u221212 is the quark degree of freedom and nq\u0303i = 6 (i = 1, 2) are the degrees of freedom\nfor scalar quarks, determined from their color, charge, and spin factors.\nAfter the electroweak symmetry breaking, ten real degrees of freedom from the Higgs\nsector of the USSM are reduced to six physical Higgs particles, namely, a pair of charged\nHiggs bosons, one pseudoscalar Higgs boson, and three scalar Higgs bosons. The squared\nmass of the neutral pseudoscalar Higgs boson at the one-loop level may be written as\nm2A = m2A0 + m2At + m2Ab + m2Ak ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere mA0 is the tree-level mass, given as\nm2A0 =\n\n2\u03bbvA\u03bb\n,\nsin 2\u03b1\n\nand mAt , mAb , and mAk account respectively for the radiative corrections from the top,\nbottom, and the exotic quark sectors:\nm2At =\nm2Ab =\nm2Ak =\n\n3m2t \u03bbAt\nf (m2t\u03031 , m2t\u03032 ) ,\n8\u03c0 2 v sin2 \u03b2 sin 2\u03b1\n3m2b \u03bbAb\nf (m2b\u03031 , m2b\u03032 ) ,\n\u2212 2\n8\u03c0 v cos2 \u03b2 sin 2\u03b1\n3m2 \u03bbAk v\n\u2212 2 k2\nf (m2k\u03031 , m2k\u03032 ) ,\n8\u03c0 s sin 2\u03b1\n\u2212\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a mixing angle between the electroweak scale and the U(1)\u2032 symmetry breaking\nscale, defined as\ntan \u03b1 =\n\nv\nsin 2\u03b2 ,\n2s\n\n(12)\n\n6\n\n\fand the dimensionless function f (m21 , m22 ) is defined as\nf (m21 ,\n\nm22 )\n\n1\nm21\nm22\n2\n2\n=\nm\nlog\n\u2212\nm\nlog\n+1 .\n1\n2\n(m22 \u2212 m21 )\n\u039b2\n\u039b2\n\"\n\n#\n\n(13)\n\nThe three neutral scalar Higgs bosons, Si (i = 1, 2, 3), of the USSM are given by the\neigenvectors of a 3 \u00d73 symmetric mass matrix, and their squared masses, mSi (i = 1, 2, 3),\nare given by the corresponding eigenvalues.

[22] by taking g1 = g2 = g1\u2032 = 0 in the above expressions. Thus, the above expressions for the scalar Higgs boson masses at the one-loop level\nare more rigorous and complete, and calculated for the first time in the USSM.\n\n4.\n\nHiggs Productions in pp Collisions\n\nIt is well noticed that the gluon fusion process, mediated by the top quark triangular\nloops, is the most dominant production channel for the SM Higgs boson in pp collisions\nat the energy of the LHC. The gluon fusion process is also important for the productions\nof the scalar Higgs bosons of the USSM at the LHC, where the loops of top quark and\ntop scalar quarks, by far, would play the most dominant role, for a large space of the\nrelevant parameters of the USSM. For very large tan \u03b2, the loops of bottom quark and\nbottom scalar quarks would also yield considerable contributions. Further, the loops of\nthe exotic quark and exotic scalar quarks may also contribute as much significantly as the\nloops of top quark sector or the bottom quark sector. Thus, in our analysis, we consider\nall of them, namely, the contributions of top, bottom, and the exotic quark sectors to the\nproductions of the USSM scalar Higgs bosons via the gluon fusion process.\nLet us denote \u03c3\u0302i (gg \u2192 Si ) as the parton-level cross section for the gluon-gluon annihilation into Si (i = 1, 2, 3) in the USSM.

In order to obtain \u03c3i (pp \u2192 Si ), the desired cross section at the laboratory\nlevel, we should fold the cross section at the parton level with the gluon distribution\nfunctions as [25,26,22]\n\u03c3i (E, mSi ) =\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u03c4S\n\nd\u03c4\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4\n\n1\n\ndx\n\n\u03c4S\ng(x, m2Si )g(\u03c4 /x, m2Si )\u03c3\u0302i (\u015d = \u03c4 E 2 ) ,\nx\n\n(33)\n\nwhere g(x, m2Si ) is the gluon distribution function at the factorization scale m2Si , with x\nbeing the fraction of the momentum of the proton carried by the gluon, g(\u03c4S /x, m2Si ) is\nthe gluon distribution functions for the other participating gluon, and \u03c4S = m2Si /E 2 is the\nDrell-Yann variable, with E being the c.m. energy of the colliding protons at the LHC.\nFor the gluon distribution functions, the CTEQ6L is used in our calculation [28].\n\n5.\n\nHiggs Decays\n\nThe scalar Higgs bosons would decay, among others, into pairs of fermions. In the SM, the\npairs of bottom quarks would be the most prominent decay modes for the SM Higgs boson\nif its mass is below 135 GeV. One may sort out the branching ratios for the SM Higgs\nboson with an intermediate mass of around 110 GeV as BR(HSM \u2192 bb) > BR(HSM \u2192\n\u03c4 \u03c4 ) > BR(HSM \u2192 gg). Thus, for such an intermediate SM Higgs boson, decaying into\na pair of gluons via the triangular loop of the top quark would be more difficult than\ndecaying into a pair of bottom quarks or a pair of tau leptons. On the other hand, if the\nmass of the SM Higgs boson turns out to be larger than 135 GeV, the Higgs decay into\na pair of gauge bosons would be more dominant than any other decay modes.\nThe situation in the USSM, we expect, would be different from the SM case, since\nthere are exotic quark and exotic scalar quarks in the USSM. In particular, they would\ncertainly affect the decays of the scalar Higgs bosons. As one can see in the superpotential\nof the USSM, the heaviest scalar Higgs boson couples directly to the exotic quarks, while\n13\n\n\fthe other scalar Higgs bosons couple indirectly to the exotic quarks through the mixings\namong them. Thus, in order to study the effects of the exotic quarks in the decays of\nthe scalar Higgs bosons, we may as well pay more attentions to the heaviest scalar Higgs\nboson than the other ones. Let us study the decay modes of the scalar Higgs bosons of\nthe USSM into pairs of fermions, gluons, and gauge bosons, as they are considered to be\nthe most important decay modes. Among them, the decay mode into gluon pairs should\nbe studied in more detail, since it may reveal the effects of the exotic quarks more clearly\nthan other decay modes.\nThe total decay width of the Si (i = 1, 2, 3) may be assumed as\n\u0393(Si ) = \u0393(Si \u2192 bb) + \u0393(Si \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 ) + \u0393(Si \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc) + \u0393(Si \u2192 cc)\n+ \u0393(Si \u2192 ss) + \u0393(Si \u2192 gg) + \u0393(Si \u2192 W W ) + \u0393(Si \u2192 ZZ) ,\n\n(34)\n\nwhere each decay mode can be understood without difficulty. Note that the heaviest\nscalar Higgs boson, S3 , has additional decay modes, since it can decay into the lighter\nones, that is, S3 \u2192 S1 S1 , S3 \u2192 S2 S2 , or S3 \u2192 S1 S2 .\nNow, let us describe each partial decays.

The scheme for setting the relevant\nparameters is similar to our previous analysis [18-22]. First of all, we note that there are\nstrong experimental constraints in the USSM on the mass of the extra gauge boson, mZ \u2032 ,\nand on the size of the mixing angle |\u03c6| between Z and Z \u2032 . In this article, we will use\nmZ \u2032 > 700 GeV and |\u03c6| < 3 \u00d7 10\u22123. The vacuum expectation value of the Higgs singlet\nis set as s = 700 GeV in order to ensure a light Z \u2032 scenario with a mass below 1 TeV.\nThe effective U(1)\u2032 hypercharges of the Higgs doublets and Higgs singlet can be redefined\nas Qi = g1\u2032 Q\u0303i because Q\u0303i appear always together with g \u2032 1 . Then, we fix the redefined\neffective hypercharges as Q1 = \u22121, Q2 = \u22120.1, and Q3 = 1.1. The Tevatron Run I data\nhave set the lower bound on the mass of an long-lived quark with electric charges \u00b11/3\nas 119 GeV [29]. The search for long-lived charged massive particles at Tevatron Run I\nput a more stringent experimental lower bound of 180 GeV at the 95 % confidence level\n[30]. Thus, we take the mass of the exotic quark as 400 GeV without contradicting the\nTevatron constraint. Also, the mass of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson at the one-loop level,\nmA , will be used as an input parameter.\nThe present experimental lower bound on the mass of the SM Higgs boson set by LEP2\ndata is about 114.5 GeV [31]. Since the scalar Higgs bosons in the USSM are mixtures\nof the real components of the three Higgs fields, the possibility of discovering them is\naffected by how much the real component of the Higgs singlet is mixed in them. Further,\nthe decay channel for the scalar Higgs bosons in the USSM is not restricted to a pair\nof bottom quarks. Thus, the search for a USSM Higgs boson would depend on not only\nits mass but also its coupling coefficients and other factors. Therefore, in our numerical\nanalysis, the lower bound on the mass of the lightest scalar Higgs boson in the USSM may\nnot be restricted by the LEP2 constraint, although it does not imply that our numerical\nanalysis may phenomenologically contradict the experimental constraint of LEP2. Our\nanalysis have been performed by assuming that the scalar Higgs bosons decay exclusively\nto a pair of bottom quarks.\nIt is well known that the top scalar quark plays a dominant role in the Higgs processes\ninvolving gluons, namely, both the productions of a scalar Higgs boson via the gluon\n16\n\n\ffusion process at the LHC and its decays into a gluon pair, in the parameter region where\nthe top scalar quark mass is below 400 GeV [25,26]. The result depends crucially on\nthe mass of the top scalar quark. In the USSM, as we concentrate on the role of the\nexotic quark and the exotic scalar quarks, the masses of the exotic scalar quarks should\nbe carefully studied. Thus, it is of importance to investigate the dependence of the exotic\nscalar quark masses on the trilinear soft SUSY breaking parameter, Ak , and on the mass\nof the exotic quark, mk .\nWe show the result for the exotic scalar quark masses as functions of Ak in Fig. 1,\nfor tan \u03b2 = 3, \u03bb = 0.387, mQ = mU = mD = mK = mK\u0304 = 300 GeV, At = Ab = 440\nGeV, and mk = 400 GeV and mA = 150 GeV. The mass of the lighter exotic scalar quark\nis calculated to be between 176 GeV and 428 GeV while the mass of the heavier one is\nbetween 493 GeV and 628 GeV. Their masses should be degenerate if Ak vanishes, but\nactually they are not exactly degenerate in mass since the non-zero \u03bb invokes a mixing\nbetween them.\nNote that the masses of the other scalar quarks as well as the scalar Higgs masses do\nnot depend on Ak . The masses of the other scalar quarks are calculated as mt\u03031 = 229\nGeV, mt\u03032 = 435 GeV, mb\u03031 = 252 GeV, and mb\u03032 = 339 GeV. The masses for the three\nscalar Higgs bosons at the one-loop level are calculated as mS1 = 117 GeV, mS2 = 156\nGeV, and mS3 = 783 GeV, which are also shown in Fig. 1.\nIn order to study the effects of the exotic quark sector in the production of the scalar\nHiggs bosons in the USSM via the gluon fusion process at the LHC, it would be convenient\nto calculate the production cross sections with or without the contributions of the exotic\nquark sector. Let us denote the production cross section of Si as \u03c3 k (Si ) where only\nthe exotic contributions are taken into account, and the production cross section of Si\nas \u03c3 t,b (Si ) where they are not included. These cross sections are obtained technically\nby taking either AS = 0 or ASD = 0 in the formula for the production cross section.\nWe also introduce \u03c3(Si ) where the loops of top, bottom, and exotic quarks and their\nscalar partners are all included. It should be noted that \u03c3(Si ) is not exactly the sum of\n\u03c3 t,b (Si ) and \u03c3 k (Si ), since there are interference terms in |AS + ASD |2 in the formula for the\nproduction cross section. However, the interference between them are negligible, for the\nparameter values we consider, such that \u03c3(Si ) is almost equal to \u03c3 t,b (Si ) + \u03c3 k (Si ). The\nresults are shown in Figs. 2a and 2b, where the values of the relevant parameters are the\nsame as in Fig. 1.\nIn Fig. 2a, \u03c3 t,b (Si ) and \u03c3 k (Si ) are plotted as functions of Ak . Note that \u03c3 t,b (Si )\ndo not change against Ak because both the scalar Higgs boson masses and the relevant\ncouplings are independent of Ak , whereas the dependency on Ak of \u03c3 k (Si ) is very clear.\nNote also that \u03c3 t,b (S3 ) is negligibly smaller than either \u03c3 t,b (S2 ) or \u03c3 t,b (S1 ). This is mainly\nbecause the mass of S3 is much heavier than the other two scalar Higgs bosons. The trend\nis consistent with the SM prediction that the production cross section decreases as the\nHiggs mass increases. It is also worthwhile noticing that \u03c3 k (S3 ) is about 103 times larger\nthan \u03c3 t,b (S3 ). This fact indicates that the loops of exotic quark and exotic scalar quarks\nvirtually dominate the S3 productions through the gluon fusion process in pp collisions.\nIn Fig. 2b, \u03c3(Si ) (i = 1, 2, 3) are plotted as functions of Ak . Comparing with Fig. 2a,\none may note that \u03c3(S1 ) \u223c\n= \u03c3 t,b (S1 ), \u03c3(S2 ) \u223c\n= \u03c3 t,b (S2 ), but \u03c3(S3 ) \u223c\n= \u03c3 k (S3 ), in particular\n17\n\n\fif Ak is not so much large as 400 GeV. Therefore, we may expect that the productions\nof the heaviest scalar Higgs bosons of the USSM at the LHC would definitely exhibit the\ncontributions of exotic quark and exotic scalar quarks in the USSM.\nNow, let us study decay processes. We calculate the partial decay width of Si (i =\n1, 2, 3) into a pair of gluons. Here, too, it would be convenient to separate the contributions\nof exotic quark and exotic scalar quark loops from the contributions of top and bottom\nquark and scalar quark loops. Let us denote the partial decay width of Si into a gluon\npair as \u0393k (Si ) where only the exotic contributions are taken into account, and the partial\ndecay width of Si as \u0393t,b (Si ) where they are not included. We also introduce \u0393(Si ) where\nthe loops of top, bottom, and exotic quarks and their scalar partners are all included.\nWe show \u0393t,b (Si ) and \u0393k (Si ) in Fig. 3a. They are plotted as functions of Ak . The\nother parameter values are the same as in Fig. 1. Like \u03c3 t,b (Si ), one can see that \u0393t,b (Si )\nare all constant against Ak . Note that \u0393t,b (S1 ) > \u0393t,b (S2 ) > \u0393t,b (S3 ), but the difference is\nnot significant. On the other hand, there is a great hierarchy among \u0393k (Si ). Note that\n\u0393k (S3 ) is larger than either \u0393k (S1 ) or \u0393k (S2 ) by several orders of magnitude.\nIn Fig. 3b, \u0393(Si ) (i = 1, 2, 3) are plotted as functions of Ak . One may notice that\n\u0393(Si ) 6= \u0393t,b (Si ) + \u0393k (Si ). This is due to the interferences between them. Clearly, by\ncomparing Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b, the discrepancy between \u0393(S1 ) and \u0393(S2 ) is more visible\nthan the discrepancy between \u0393t,b (S1 ) and \u0393t,b (S2 ). We expect that the interference\nbetween \u0393t,b (S2 ) and \u0393k (S2 ) is rather destructive such that \u0393(S2 ) < \u0393t,b (S2 ). Nevertheless,\nfor the heaviest scalar Higgs boson, it is evident that practically \u0393(S3 ) \u223c\n= \u0393k (S3 ), since\nk\nt,b\n\u0393 (S3 ) \u226b \u0393 (S3 ).\nNext, we turn to the branching ratios of Si (i = 1, 2, 3). The results are shown in\nFigs. 4-6. The values of the relevant parameters are the same as in Fig. 1. In Fig. 4,\nwe show the branching ratios of S1 , namely, BR(S1 \u2192 bb), BR(S1 \u2192 cc), BR(S1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 ),\nand BR(S1 \u2192 gg), as functions of Ak . The other branching ratios are very small to be\nincluded in the figure. Note that the branching ratios for pairs of ordinary quarks are\nflat against Ak , whereas BR(S1 \u2192 gg) increases very slightly as Ak increases, since the\nmass of the lighter exotic scalar quark decreases down to about the top quark mass as Ak\nincreases. Comparing Fig. 4 with the following figures, one can see that BR(S1 \u2192 bb) is\nmuch larger than BR(S2 \u2192 bb), or BR(S3 \u2192 bb) that is too small to be shown in Fig. 6.\nIn Fig. 5, we show the branching ratios of S2 , namely, BR(S2 \u2192 bb), BR(S2 \u2192\ncc), BR(S2 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 ), and BR(S2 \u2192 gg), as functions of Ak . Here, one may notice that\nBR(S2 \u2192 cc) > BR(S2 \u2192 bb), and BR(S2 \u2192 gg) > BR(S2 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 ), while the corresponding\ninequalities are reversed in case of S1 , as shown in Fig. 4. Also, notice that BR(S2 \u2192 gg)\ndecreases mildly as Ak increases by the contribution of the exotic quark and exotic scalar\nquarks for the full range of Ak .\nSince S3 is much heavier than S1 or S2 , its decay channels are richer than the lighter\nscalar Higgs bosons. In particular, it may decay into a pair of exotic scalar quarks or into a\npair of exotic quarks, depending on the masses of participating particles. According to our\nanalysis, the masses are obtained as mS3 = 780 GeV, mk = 400 GeV, and 200 < mk\u03031 < 450\nGeV. Thus, S3 may decay into a pair of exotic quarks off shell, and into a pair of the\nlighter exotic scalar quarks both on and off shell.\nLet us consider the on-shell decays of S3 into a pair of the lighter exotic scalar quarks\n18\n\n\ffor Ak > 150 GeV. Its partial decay width is given by\n \u0304\n\u0393(S3 \u2192 k\u03031 k\u0303 1 ) =\n\n2\n\n3v\n(G\n8\u03c0mS3 S3 k\u03031 k\u03031\n\nv\nu\nu\nm2k\u0303\n2t\n) 1\u22124 1\n\nm2S3\n\nwhere GS3 k\u03031 k\u03031 is given by Eq. (29). This formula is used to calculate the branching\nratio of S3 into a pair of k\u03031 . In Fig. 6, we show BR(S3 \u2192 k\u03031 k\u03031 ), the branching ratio\nfor S3 decays into a pair of the lighter exotic scalar quarks, as function of Ak , as well\nas other dominant branching ratios of S3 , namely, BR(S3 \u2192 S1 S1 ), BR(S3 \u2192 S2 S2 ),\nBR(S3 \u2192 S1 S2 ), BR(S3 \u2192 tt), BR(S3 \u2192 W W ), BR(S3 \u2192 ZZ), and BR(S3 \u2192 gg).\nIt is clear in Fig. 6 that S3 would decay mostly into a pair of lighter scalar Higgs\nbosons: BR(S3 \u2192 S1 S1 ) and BR(S3 \u2192 S2 S2 ) are almost equal and dominant over other\ndecay channels. Nevertheless, BR(S3 \u2192 k\u03031 k\u0303 \u03041 ) increases sharply at Ak \u223c 150 GeV, and\nbecomes quite compatible to them. Note that BR(S3 \u2192 k\u03031 k\u0303 \u0304 1 ) reaches its maximum at\nAk = 270 GeV. One may also notice that the branching ratio for a gluon pair is far less\nthan 1 %, and fluctuates visibly due to the Ak dependence of the exotic contributions. It\nis comparable to BR(S3 \u2192 W W ) or BR(S3 \u2192 ZZ). However, the S3 decays into a gluon\npair is almost solely mediated by the loops of the exotic quark and exotic scalar quarks.\nIn Fig. 6, one may notice that S3 may decay quite dominantly into a pair of S1 , a\npair of S2 , a pair of the lighter exotic scalar quarks, a pair of top quarks, or into S1\nand S2 , as well as a pair of gluons. The branching ratio of S3 into a pair of gluons is\nvery small as 0.001 at best. We can obtain the number of raw Higgs events by using the\nintegrated luminosity of the detectors such as CMS [32] or ATLAS [33]. For the integrated\nluminosity of 700 fb\u22121 which is expected to be reached in about ten years at the LHC\n(CMS + ATLAS), about 140 raw Higgs events for S3 would be produced at the LHC [34].\nThus, the decay mode of S3 into a pair of gluons would not be relevant for any practical\npurpose, since the background for such events is large at the LHC. Consequently, other\ndecay modes would be more worthwhile studying, or the super LHC (SLHC), an upgrade\nof the LHC, is necessary to study the gluon decays of the heaviest quark in our model.\nNote that the target of the integrated luminosity for SLHC is about 3000 fb\u22121 during the\nperiod of its operation [34].\nThe mass of the SM Higgs boson is determined by the vacuum expectation value of\nthe electroweak symmetry breaking, in which itself plays a crucial role. Thus, it is natural\nto expect that the SM Higgs boson has a mass of the scale of the electroweak symmetry\nbreaking. By requiring that there should be no Landau pole up to the cut off scale, the\nrenormalization group equation for the mass of the SM Higgs boson predicts that it is\nsmaller than 190 GeV, if the cut off scale is the Planck mass scale.\nIf the SM Higgs boson is discovered with a mass of the electroweak symmetry breaking\nscale and if S3 of the present model is about 780 GeV, there would be no serious difficulty\nto distinguish between them. On the other hand, if the SM Higgs boson is discovered with\na mass comparable to the mass of S3 of the present model, their decay modes may be a\nuseful tool to distinguish between them. For the parameter value we consider, the mass\nof S3 is about 780 GeV, and its decay modes are shown in Fig. 6. Let us assume that\nthe mass of the SM Higgs boson is also about 780 GeV. With this mass, the SM Higgs\n19\n\n\fboson would decay 60 % in W boson pairs, 30 % in Z boson pairs, and 7 % in top quark\npairs. On the other hand, as Fig. 6 shows, S3 would decay 45 % into S1 S1 and 45 % into\n \u0304\nS1 S2 for 0 < Ak (GeV) < 130, or 30 % each for S1 S1 , S1 S2 , and k\u03031 k\u0303 1 for Ak \u223c 250 GeV.\nFurther, as Figs. 4 and 5 show, S1 and S2 would respectively decay into a pair of bottom\nquarks by 60 % and 19 %. Therefore, using the decay modes of bottom quark pairs as\nbackground, assuming 700 fb\u22121 for the integrated luminosity of the LHC, we would have\n29862 events of S3 \u2192 bb\u0304 whereas 2362 events for the same decay modes for the SM Higgs\nbosons. In this case, the signal significance is more than 614\u03c3, well above the discovery\nlimit.\nSince S3 is much heavier than S1 or S2 , it may decay into a pair of exotic scalar quarks\nor into a pair of exotic quarks. For the parameter values we take up to now, the mass of\nS3 is 780 GeV, the mass of the exotic quarks is 400 GeV, and the mass of the lighter exotic\nscalar quarks is between 180 and 450 GeV. Thus, for this choice of parameter values, S3\nmay decay into a pair of the lighter exotic scalar quarks both on and off shell. On the\nother hand, it is kinematically forbidden for S3 to decay into a pair of exotic quarks on\nshell.\nIn order to study the on-shell decays of S3 into a pair of exotic quarks, we need to\nexplore other regions of the parameter space. We would like to study the parameter region\nwhere mk = 400 GeV and mS3 is larger than 800 GeV. We find that a representative set\nof the parameter values in this region is tan \u03b2 = 3, \u03bb = 0.5, mQ = mU = mD = mK =\nmK\u0304 = 500 GeV, At = Ab = 440 GeV, mk = 400 GeV, mA = 900 GeV, and 0 < Ak < 900\nGeV. These parameter values yield 176 < mk\u03031 (GeV) < 585, 635 < mk\u03032 (GeV) < 845,\nmS1 \u223c 114.5 GeV, mS2 \u223c 750.6 GeV, and mS3 \u223c 928.7 GeV, satisfying our requirement.\nFig. 7 shows the masses of these particles as functions of Ak . Hence, with this choice of\nparameter values, S3 may decay into a pair of exotic quarks on shell.\nWe calculate the production cross sections for the scalar Higgs bosons via gluon fusion\nprocess at the LHC. The radiative corrections include the contributions from loops of\ntop quarks, bottom quarks, exotic quarks, and their scalar superpartners. The results\nare shown in Fig. 8. The parameter values are the same as Fig. 7. We then calculate\nthe branching ratios of the scalar Higgs bosons. The results for the branching ratios are\nshown in Figs. 9, 10, and 11, for the same parameter values as Fig. 7.\nThese figures may be compared with Figs. 4, 5, and 6, respectively. Consider first\nFig. 9, which shows the branching ratios of S1 . The behavior of S1 in Fig. 9 is not so\nmuch different from its behavior in Fig. 4, mainly because its mass is roughly the same\nin both figures: mS1 \u223c 114.5 GeV in Fig. 9 and mS1 \u223c 117 GeV in Fig. 4.\nBy contrast, the behavior of the branching ratios of S2 in Fig.10 is strikingly different\nfrom that in Fig. 5, since mS2 \u223c 750 GeV in Fig. 10 and mS2 \u223c 156 GeV in Fig. 5. In\n \u0304\nparticular, the branching ratio for a pair of lighter exotic scalar quarks, BR (S2 \u2192 k\u03031 k\u0303 1 ),\ncan be seen in Fig. 10, whereas it is absent in Fig. 5, as it is forbidden kinematically\n \u0304\nthere. The coupling coefficient of S2 to a pair of k\u03031 k\u0303 1 depends very severely on Ak . Thus,\nthe branching ratio for a pair of lighter exotic scalar quarks varies wildly as Ak changes.\nNote that S2 cannot decay into a pair of exotic quarks on shell, since its mass is smaller\nthan 2mk , in both figures.\n\n20\n\n\fThe heaviest scalar Higgs boson, S3 , on the other hand, may decay into a pair of\nexotic quarks on shell, as shown in Fig. 11. One may notice that the branching ratio of\nS3 \u2192 k k\u0304 is considerably larger than the branching ratios for gauge boson pair or gluon\npair. Therefore, for some parameter regions where S3 is allowed kinematically to decay\ninto a pair of exotic quarks, the decays of the heaviest scalar quark into exotic quarks may\nbecome important to examine our model. Also, the branching ratio for a pair of exotic\nscalar quarks in Fig. 11 varies more wildly than in Fig. 6.\n\n7.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this article, we study the Higgs sector of the USSM at the one-loop level. The radiative\ncorrections from the loops of top, bottom and exotic quarks and their superpartners\nare calculated for the scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs boson masses, where we include\nthe D-term contribution. For the numerical analysis, we take tan \u03b2 = 3, \u03bb = 0.387,\nmQ = mU = mD = mK = mK\u0304 = 300 GeV, At = Ab = 440 GeV, and the mass of the\nexotic quark as mk = 400 GeV and the mass of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson as mA = 150\nGeV. We assume that CP symmetry is conserved in the Higgs sector of the USSM. We\nfind that the exotic scalar quarks become nearly degenerate in mass for small Ak .\nFor the USSM Higgs phenomenology at the LHC, we study the production processes\nand decay modes of the scalar Higgs bosons that involve gluons. As the scalar Higgs\nbosons may be produced in pp collisions via the gluon fusion process, we calculate the\nproduction cross sections for the gluon fusion process, considering the loop contributions\nfrom top, bottom, and exotic quarks and their superpartners. We find that, for the\nheaviest scalar Higgs boson of the USSM, the gluon fusion process is mediated virtually\nonly by the loops of exotic quark and exotic scalar quarks. So is the partial decay width\nof the heaviest scalar Higgs boson into a pair of gluons. In other words, practically, the\nheaviest scalar Higgs boson couples to a pair of gluons only through the loops of exotic\nquark and exotic scalar quarks. Thus, the contributions from the loops of top and bottom\nquarks and their scalar partners are negligible in the gluon fusion process of the heaviest\nscalar Higgs boson production as well as in its partial decay width into a gluon pair.\nHowever, the partial decay width of the heaviest scalar Higgs boson into a pair of gluons\nis less than 1 %, just comparable to its partial decay width into a pair of gauge bosons.\nWe should note that our results are obtained for a particular set of parameter values,\nallowing Ak to vary between 0 and 450 GeV. Thus, it may be hard to say that this set\nof parameter values represent the whole parameter space of the USSM. We may have\nto search a much wider region of the parameter space of the USSM in order to obtain\nmore predictive results for the contributions of the exotic quark and exotic scalar quarks\nin the Higgs phenomenology. However, qualitatively, our results suggest that the exotic\nquark and exotic scalar quarks play observable roles in the productions and decays of the\nscalar Higgs bosons of the USSM at the LHC. In order to examine the USSM at the LHC,\nin particular to examine the effects of the exotic quark sector in the Higgs physics, the\nheaviest scalar Higgs boson may be one of the best windows, as our calculations clearly\nsuggests.\n21\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nS.
