Introduction\nRadiation originating from the molecular gas in various galaxy\nenvironments, including galaxy centers, provides information\nabout the physical state of these environments such as the gas\nmass and temperature, or the source of its excitation. The farultraviolet radiation (FUV; 6.0 < E < 13.6 eV) emitted by\nnewly formed luminous stars and X-rays (E > 1 keV) produced by black hole accretion have very distinct effects on\nthe thermo-chemical balance of the gas. Strong FUV illumination results in so-called photon-dominated regions (PDRs;\nTielens & Hollenbach (1985)), while X-ray irradiation creates\nX-ray dominated regions (XDRs; Maloney et al. (1996)). In\nPDRs and XDRs, the thermal and chemical structure is completely determined by the radiation field, and directly reflects\nthe energy balance of the interstellar gas. For example, in PDRs\nthe CO is generally much cooler (T\u223c 10-30 K) than in XDRs\n(T \u223c 20 \u2212 500 K), therefore XDRs generally exhibit CO emissions to much higher J levels. Thus, observations of the CO ladder allow us to discriminate between the different types of radiation fields.\n\nRecently, it has become clear that PDR and XDR excitation\nis not sufficient to fully explain observed molecular line emission ratios. For instance, Loenen et al. (2008) have found that\nthe HCN, HNC, and HCO+ line ratios observed towards (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies span a parameter space that cannot be reproduced by models in which FUV or X-ray radiation\ndominates. In their study they showed that an additional heating mechanism is required, which they suggest to be mechanical heating caused by dissipating supernova shocks, injected\non large scales and cascading down through turbulent dissipation to the smallest scales. More recently, Papadopoulos et al.\n(2010) has suggested that cosmic ray ionization rates in such\ngalaxies may exceed those measured in the Milky Way by factors of 103 to 104 , hence significantly affect the ionization balance and thermal-chemical structure of interstellar clouds. The\neffects of high cosmic ray rates on ISM chemistry is studied in\ndetail by Meijerink et al. (2011) (who consider mechanical heating as well only for selected models) and Bayet et al. (2011).\nHowever, neither the models by Loenen et al. (2008) nor\nthose by Meijerink et al. (2011) treat mechanical heating selfconsistently, as it is only implemented as an additional heating\n1\n\n\fKazandjian et. al: Diagnostics of PDRs with Mechanical Heating\n\nterm and not as feedback from hydrodynamics. The dynamical\nevolution of the interstellar medium in galaxies in general and\nclose to a super-massive black hole in particular, has been studied in 3D hydrodynamic simulations (Wada & Norman, 2002;\nWada & Tomisaka, 2005) but these in turn lacked chemistry,\nand line emission maps of the various molecules were created\nby using constant abundances. A study by P\u00e9rez-Beaupuits et al.\n(2011) improved on this by using chemical abundances obtained\nfrom the Meijerink & Spaans (2005) XDR code. Nevertheless,\nthese simulations still lack UV input and feedback from the\nhydrodynamics on the chemistry still needs to be done selfconsistently.\nThe dominant coolants in the ISM which are commonly observed are the [CI] 609 \u03bcm, [CII] 158 \u03bcm and the [OI] 63 \u03bcm\nlines. These fine-structure lines are not sensitive to additional\nmechanical heating, when the clouds are already illuminated\nby FUV radiation Meijerink et al. (2011). This is in contrast to\nthe molecular species that are formed in regions of the cloud,\nthat are shielded from irradiation. Thus in this paper we consider molecular species as possible candidates for tracing regions which are dominated by mechanical heating. Although a\nsimple dust model is taken into account (Meijerink & Spaans,\n2005), dust diagnostics are not discussed since these diagnostics\nare out of the scope of this paper. We will explore the possible tracers in a number of steps. In this paper, we will first establish under which physical conditions mechanical heating is\nimportant. We will estimate what range of mechanical heating\nrates we may expect for the different densities in the ISM. We\nwill then determine how this affects the thermo-chemical balance in the models, and, by way of first application, discuss the\neffect on the integrated column densities of common molecular\nspecies such as CO, H2 O, HNC, HCN and HCO+ , and some of\ntheir ratios. In subsequent papers, we will calculate line emission\nmaps that can be compared directly to the detailed observations\nobtained with (sub)millimeter telescopes, notably the Atacama\nLarge Millimeter Array. Ultimately, our aim is to couple chemistry and hydrodynamics in order to treat the relevant physical\neffects in a self-consistent manner.\n\nour discussion concentrates on the Z = Z\u2299 models2 . For the\ncosmic-ray ionization rate, we adopted the value 5 \u00d7 10\u221217 s\u22121\nused in Meijerink & Spaans (2005) which is close to that in\nthe solar neighborhood. The grids consisted of models spanning a wide range of physical conditions, uniformly sampled\n(in log10 scale) in ambient gas density 1 < n < 106 cm\u22123 , incident radiation field 0.32 < G0 < 106 and mechanical heating\n10\u221224 < \u0393mech < 10\u221216 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 . In the absence of mechanical heating, n and G0 dominate the characteristics of a PDR. The\nambient gas density n is the total number density of hydrogen\nnuclei, which is set constant throughout the slab. The values considered cover the full range of densities encountered in the diffuse interstellar medium to those of dense molecular cloud cores.\nThe incident FUV radiation field G0 is measured in so-called\nHabing units (Habing, 1969) corresponding to 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22123 erg\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 . The values considered here include radiation fields\nranging from only a few times stronger than the relatively low\nsolar neighborhood field to the intense fields irradiating clouds\nclose to young OB associations; the upper limit corresponds to\nthe radiation field intensity at a distance of about 0.1 pc from an\nO star.\nIn constraining a physically relevant range of mechanical\nheating rates, we took a combination of values recovered from\nsoftened particle hydrodynamics simulations (SPH hereafter)\n(Pelupessy, 2005), and added estimates of mechanical heating\nrates induced by turbulence caused by supernova shocks that\nare dissipated in the ISM (Loenen et al., 2008). The SPH simulations are of dwarf galaxies with n up to \u223c 103 cm\u22123 where\nthe mechanical heating rates ranged from \u223c 10\u221230 to 10\u221222 erg\ncm\u22123 s\u22121 for such densities. When naively extrapolated to densities of 106 cm\u22123 , rates up to 10\u221218 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 are expected.\nIn the Loenen et al. (2008) recipe, it is assumed that \u03b7 = 10%\nof the supernova blast energy (E0 = 1051 erg per SN event) is\nabsorbed throughout the continuous starburst region (a region\nwhich by definition sustains a considerably high SFR, which is\nsteady, by consuming the available gas), whose size is taken to\nbe DSB = 100 pc. Eq. 1, which is a combination of Eq. 3 and\n4 in Loenen et al. (2008), relates \u0393mech to the the supernova rate\n(SNR).\n\n2. Methods\n\n\u0393mech =\n\nWe solve the equilibrium state of all model clouds by using\nan optimized version1 of the Leiden PDR-XDR code developed\nby Meijerink & Spaans (2005) (Details of the optimization and\nfurther improvements are mentioned in Sect. 2.2). In its present\nform, the code assumes a 1D PDR geometry where various heating and cooling processes are included in solving for the thermal\nand chemical balance. The radiative transfer for the cooling lines\nand the escape probabilities are computed based on the work by\nde Jong et al. (1980). We refer the reader to Meijerink & Spaans\n(2005) for further details on the thermal processes and chemical\nnetwork used in solving for the steady state equilibria.\n\nwhere VSB is the volume of the starburst region, whereas VPDR\nand nPDR are the volume and number density of PDRs in that\nstarburst region respectively. They also assumed that the absorbed energy is distributed evenly among the PDRs in this starburst region. The number of the PDRs in the starburst region is\nestimated by assuming a gas density contrast of 10 (the inverse\nof the filling factor) between that of the PDRs and the ambient\nISM of the starburst. Considering a Salpeter IMF for the stellar population, the star formation rate (SFR) is related to the\nSNR via SNR/SFR = 0.0064 (see Dahl\u00e9n & Fransson (1999)\nfor details). In computing the SNR, they assumed that stars with\nM > 8 M\u2299 end up as supernovae (see Loenen et al. (2008)\nfor more details on the estimates and assumptions). A Kroupa\n(2001) IMF, over the mass range from 0.1M\u2299 to 125M\u2299 considered, would result in a marginally higher SNR/SFR \u223c 0.01.\nThis higher rate reflects a slightly enhanced mechanical heating\nrate. However, the difference in the resulting \u0393mech between both\nIMFs over the same mass range is \u223c 40%, thus for simplicity we\nadopted the Salpeter IMF.\n\n2.1. Parameter space and reference models\n\nIn order to reduce the number of free parameters, we considered three metallicity levels, the benchmark being Z = Z\u2299 (solar metallicity) to which we added Z = 0.5Z\u2299 (characteristic of\nmoderately metal-poor dwarf galaxies) and Z = 2Z\u2299 (characteristic of spiral galaxy center conditions). Throughout the paper,\n1\n\n2\n\nThe optimized code is called PDR-XDR-1.1\n\nSNRE0 \u03b7\nVSB VPDR nPDR\n\n(1)\n\n2\nThe analogous grids for the other two metallicities are presented in\nthe Appendix\n\n\fKazandjian et. al: Diagnostics of PDRs with Mechanical Heating\n\nBy way of example, a mechanical heating rate \u0393mech of\n2 \u00d7 10\u221220 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 is expected in a quiescent disc, such\nas that of the Milky Way with an SFR \u223c 1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and\nan SNR of \u223c0.01 yr\u22121 . In regions with active star formation\n(SFR\u223c 50 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and SNR\u223c0.3 yr\u22121 ) the mechanical heating\nrate is much higher, \u0393mech = 1 \u00d7 10\u221218 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 . For extreme\nstarbursts with (SFR\u223c 1000 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and SNR\u223c6.4 yr\u22121 ) mechanical heating rates \u0393mech = 2 \u00d7 10\u221217 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 are possible. Another source of mechanical energy input is the outflows of\nyoung stellar objects (YSOs). The outflow phase is short-lived,\nand as discussed by (Loenen et al., 2008) a nearby dense cloud\n( n > 105 cm\u22123 ) is required for a significant amount of energy\nto be absorbed by the surrounding ISM (compared to the mechanical heating due to supernovae). Hence energy input due to\nYSOs is ignored in this study. Based on a similar order of magnitude estimate, mechanical energy input due to stellar winds are\nalso ignored, since they would contribute up to 6% to the total\nmechanical heating (Pelupessy, 2005; Leitherer et al., 1999).\nIt is of interest to determine the effects of mechanical heating by comparing the results obtained from models with and\nwithout a mechanical heating term. To this end, we have selected from the grids calculated for analysis and discussion in\nthis paper the same reference models that were studied in detail by Meijerink & Spaans (2005) without taking into account\nmechanical heating. These models are summarized in Table 1.\nModel Name\nM1\nM2\nM3\nM4\n\nlog n (cm\u22123 )\n3.0\n3.0\n5.5\n5.5\n\nlog G0\n3.0\n5.0\n3.0\n5.0\n\nTable 1. Parameters of the reference models. These are identical\nto the ones in Meijerink & Spaans (2005). M1 and M2 correspond to low density clouds in galactic centers in the presence\nof a starburst event, whereas M3 and M4 correspond to much\ndenser clouds where excitation of high density gas tracers such\nas HCN is possible.\n\nIn this first exploration, \u0393mech is added per unit volume. In\ndoing so for a certain grid, each model in the n \u2212 G0 parameter\nspace has an extra \u0393mech added to its heating budget. Another\nchoice could have been the addition of \u0393mech per unit mass,\nwhere for a certain grid the amount of added mechanical heating\nwould be proportional to the gas density of the model in the grid.\nFor simplicity we considered adding mechanical heating per unit\nvolume.\n2.2. Numerical schemes\n\nFinding the thermal and chemical equilibrium for each slab is an\n(N +1)-dimensional numerical root finding problem. N being the\nnumber of species (atomic and molecular species and electrons)\nin the chemical network in addition to the thermal balance. It\ninvolves solving the set of non-linear equations Eqs. 2 and 3.\ndn(T )/dt = 0\n\n(2)\n\n\u0393(T, n) \u2212 \u039b(T, n, t) = 0\n\n(3)\n\nThe first equation (chemical balance) is the rate of change\nof the density of the species at a certain temperature T . We\nsolved for this vector equation of length N following the recipe\n\nby Tielens & Hagen (1982) in using the multi-dimensional\nNewton-Raphson method. The thermal balance is solved for in\nthe second equation, where \u0393 and \u039b are the total heating and\ncooling rates. These two terms are a 1D function of n (used\nas input from the previous equation) and T . This process is repeated iteratively until convergence with a tolerance of 10\u22126 for\nthe chemical balance and 10\u22123 for the thermal balance. Two major improvements lead to a speed-up by a factor of \u223c 30 over\nthe original PDR-XDR code. These are (a) tweaking the LU\ndecomposition (optimizing compiler flags and matrix elements\nstorage scheme) used in the multi-dimensional Newton-Raphson\nroot finding, and (b) using in the thermal balance root finding the\nsecant method (with a convergence order of \u223c 1.6) instead of the\nbisection method which has a linear convergence rate.\nThe distance from the surface of the cloud is measured in\nterms of the visual extinction (AV ) due to interstellar dust. It is\nrelated to the total column density of hydrogen nuclei N(H) according to Eq. 4 (Bohlin et al., 1978).\nAV = 5.34 \u00d7 10\u221222 NH Z mag cm\u22122\n\n(4)\n\nOnce the equilibrium state of the surface slab (with zero thickness) is solved for, the width of the remaining slabs is chosen\nadaptively while resolving the transition zone which has large\ntemperature gradients compared to the small temperature gradients at the surface of the slab and at high depths. This is also\none of the changes over the original implementation. In choosing the slab width adaptively, the maximum allowed relative difference in the temperature between consecutive slabs was set to\n5%. Smaller values were tested as well, where no significant difference was noticed.\nIt is assumed that the mechanical heating due to turbulence\nis absorbed by the ISM at all scales. Hence for simplicity \u0393mech\nis added uniformly throughout the cloud.\nMolecular clouds may have a visual extinction up to 200\nmag (Tielens & Hagen, 1982). Beyond AV \u223c 5 mag most of\nthe species become molecular whereas for AV > 10 mag all\nabundances are almost constant since physical conditions do not\nchange anymore. The maximum depth, we allowed for, in all\nthe models, was AV = 20 mag. This corresponds to N(H) =\n7.5 \u00d7 1022 , 3.7 \u00d7 1022 and 1.8 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 for metallicities of\nZ =0.5, 1 and 2Z\u2299 respectively. This enables us to compare\nclouds of different metallicities up to the same column density.\nIn doing so, a fixed N(H) = 1.8 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 (the maximum\nN(H) for Z =2Z\u2299 ) was adopted in the illustrations where column\ndensities of molecular species were used.\nFor each value of mechanical heating and metallicity, 25\u00d725\nmodels equally spaced in log10 n and log10 G0 were calculated,\nup to a total of \u223c16000 models. When there is no or very little\nmechanical heating, the temperature may drop below 10 K at a\ncertain depth in the cloud. Since the code is designed to work for\n10 < T < 104 K[3] , for slab elements where the lower limit is\nreached we solved the chemical network for a fixed temperature\nof 10 K. In making the convergence more robust, we built a small\n3\nThe lower bound in the temperature is set to 10 K since many reaction constants become inaccurate below that value (R\u00f6llig, 2011). He\nand Fe+ cooling become important above 104 K which make the thermal\nbalance inaccurate since these are not included in the current version\n(in addition to other dielectronic recombination processes). But below\n104 K, the contribution of these processes is negligible to the total cooling. Also for T > 104 K, the heating efficiency expression becomes\ninaccurate. However, not many models exceed 104 K, but we allowed\nthat since it is needed to make the models converge as the solution is\nprogressed into the cloud.\n\n3\n\n\fKazandjian et. al: Diagnostics of PDRs with Mechanical Heating\n\ndatabase of guess values (used as input in the root finding) for the\nsurface slab. This enabled us to explore regions in the parameters\nwhere the original implementation failed.\nIn running the models, an improved version of the PDRXDR code was incorporated into the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE) framework. The\nAMUSE package allows astrophysical codes from different domains to be combined to conduct numerical experiments (see\nPelupessy & Portegies Zwart (2012) for a more complete description). It is a development of the Multi-physics and Multiscale Software Environment (MUSE, Portegies Zwart et al.,\n2009) and is freely available for download4. (The PDR code itself will be made available in the future). The interface to the\nMeijerink PDR-XDR code takes the main parameters G0 , n,\n\u0393mech as input and calculates the PDR equilibrium properties.\nThis will allow the code to eventually be used as an equilibrium\nsub-grid model for e.g. galaxy scaled hydrodynamic simulations.\nIn the present work this feature is not used, only the capability\nto run many models in parallel is.\n\n3. Results\nIn this section we present the comparisons for thermal and chemical diagnostics of the grids modeled with and without mechanical heating. We start by discussing the temperatures at the cloud\nsurface, and at the maximum cloud depth considered since for\na given model, the gas temperature to a large extent determines\nthe chemical composition. Following this, we will discuss the\nstatistical properties of the CO, H2 O, HCN, HNC and HCO+\nmolecules which are important diagnostics for moderate and\ndense gas. Throughout this section, we use the reference models\n(M1 to M4) to illustrate the impact of mechanical heating on the\nproperties of the PDRs as a function of depth.\n\ntemperature dependence on metallicity has also been observed\nby R\u00f6llig et al. (2006). It is worth noting that in the lower righthand corner of the grid (n > 105.5 cm\u22123 , G0 < 5) three equilibria were found, one unstable and two stable ones. The stable\nequilibria correspond to a low (\u223c 50 K) and a high temperature\n(\u223c 300 K) state with the unstable one in-between. Here we have\nshown the low-temperature equilibrium. In any case, we note\nthat this part of the parameter space is not of physical relevance\nfor systems that interest us here..\nThe dominant heating term at the cloud surface is photoelectric heating, where electrons ejected from the dust grains\ncollide elastically with the gas and heat it. The typical efficiency (\u01eb) of this process is quite low 0.5 to 1% with a maximum of \u223c 5% (Black & Dalgarno, 1977). The photo-electric\nheating rate (\u0393photo ) at the surface is given by the expression\n(Bakes & Tielens, 1994):\n\u0393photo = 10\u221224 \u01ebG0 n erg cm\u22123 s\u22121\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u01eb depends on electron density (ne ), G0 and gas temperature. The expression for \u01eb is given in Eq-6 (Bakes & Tielens,\n1994).\n\u0010\n\u00110.7\n3.65 \u00d7 10\u22122 T/104\n4.87 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\u01eb=\n+\n\u0001 (6)\n\u0001\n1 + 4 \u00d7 10\u22123 G0 T 1/2 /ne 0.73 1 + 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 G0 T 1/2 /ne\nHence the log10 of Eq. 5 is linear in log10 n and log10 G0 whenever \u01eb is constant. Fig. 2 shows the total heating in the n \u2212 G0\nplane. In the top part of the plot, the contours are almost straight\nlines. This is not surprising, \u0393photo accounts in most cases for\nmore than 95% of the total heating budget. To illustrate this, we\nlook at the logarithm of Eq. 5, which in expanded form becomes\n:\n\n3.1. Gas temperature\n\nIn the absence of other heating terms (such as due to mechanical\nheating) PDRs are characterized by rapid decreases in temperature, from \u223c1000 K at the surface down to \u223c10 K in regions\nwhere AV exceeds 10 mag. Since mechanical heating may be\nexpected to considerably change the temperature structure, we\nwill first explore this.\n3.1.1. Temperature at the surface\n\nAt the surface we only need to solve for the equilibrium of a single slab (with zero thickness). Because this can be done much\nfaster than in the case of a full slab, a higher resolution is possible for the surface grids. These surface grids therefore consisted of 2500 (50 \u00d7 50) models uniformly sampled in log10 n\nand log10 G0 . In Fig. 1 the surface temperature, without mechanical heating (\u0393mech = 0 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 ), is shown for three different metallicities. The temperature contours are in good agreement with the profiles recovered by Kaufman et al. (1999) and\nMeijerink et al. (2007)(which uses the original implementation).\nWe note that metallicity has little effect on the overall topology\nof the contour plots, except for regions where G0 > 104 , especially where n > 104 cm\u22123 . The temperature almost doubles as\nZ is increased from Z\u2299 to 2Z\u2299 , with no noticeable change between Z = 0.5Z\u2299 and Z = Z\u2299 . This is because cooling scales\nas Z whereas the dominant heating term scales almost as Z for\nlow n but increases to \u223c Z 2 as n increases to 106 cm\u22123 . This\n4\n\n4\n\nwww.amusecode.org\n\nFig. 2. Total heating at the cloud surface without mechanical\nheating. The main characteristic of this plot is that above the\ndiagonal, the contours are parallel straight lines; whereas below\nthe diagonal (G0 = n line), there is a break in the slope, indicating that photo-electric heating is no longer the dominant mechanism in that region. The minimum total heating is of the order\nof 10\u221225.5 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 at the lower left corner and 10\u221215.2 erg\ncm\u22123 s\u22121 at the top right corner.\n\nlog10 \u0393photo = \u221224 + log10 \u01eb + log10 G0 + log10 n\n\n(7)\n\n\fKazandjian et. al: Diagnostics of PDRs with Mechanical Heating\n\nFig. 1. Temperature profile (without mechanical heating) at the cloud surface for different metallicities. Generally, the temperature\nrises as a function of G0 and constant n, since the dominant heating term is the photo-electric heating, which is proportional to G0 .\nHowever the behavior for constant G0 as a function of n is not as trivial. See Section 3.1 of Kaufman et al. (1999) and Section 3\nof Meijerink et al. (2007) for more discussion of the topology of the contours. This version of the code covers a larger parameter\nrange than Meijerink et al. (2007) . Solid lines with filled squares highlight the temperature contours for 100, 500 and 1500 K . The\nmost significant change when comparing the three panels is for the 1500 K contour, where for Z = 2Z\u2299 higher temperatures are\nattained ( compared to the lower metallicities) in the same part of the parameter space ( n > 103 cm\u22123 , G0 > 104 ) .\nwhich is linear in both log10 G0 and log10 n. This means that\nthe heating efficiency is almost constant wherever the contours\nare straight lines. This is not true in the regions below the\nbreak in the contour lines which occurs in the region under the\nG0 = n line in Fig. 2. In that part of parameter space, photoelectric heating is complemented by H2 photo-dissociation heating. However, this is a small part of the total parameter space, so\nthat we are justified in using photo-electric heating as a good approximation for the total heating. Hence, we expect total heating\nto have a linear dependence on log10 n for constant values of G0 .\nThis is achieved by fitting horizontal cuts of \u0393total in Fig. 2 as a\nfunction of n for different values of G0 .\nFrom the fits, we could see that the minimum surface heating\nfor the lowest density gas considered (n = 1 cm\u22123 ) ranges from\n10\u221225.6 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 (for low G0 ) to 10\u221224.0 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 (for high\nG0 ). In contrast, the maximum surface heating for n = 106 cm\u22123 ,\nis 10\u221215.2 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 . We also observe that the surface heating\nscales as n1.21 for G0 < 102 and n1.55 for G0 > 104 .\nThe equilibrium temperature is expected to vary depending\non the amount of extra heating introduced via \u0393mech . Following\nthis simple assumption, we expect to have significant changes\nin the equilibrium temperature when \u0393mech is comparable to the\ntotal surface heating, with a varying impact on different parts of\nthe parameter space. In order to determine the zone in the parameter space where \u0393mech alters the equilibrium state, we solve\nfor n in Eq. 7 by equating it to \u0393mech . In other words, we solve for\nn in \u0393total,surface (n) = \u0393mech for the range in \u0393mech we have considered in our parameter space. These solutions, nc , listed in Table 2\nmark the lines in the G0 \u2212 n plane where mechanical heating is\nthe same as the total surface heating. To the left of these lines,\n\u0393mech > \u0393surface .\nIn Fig. 3 the equilibrium temperature of the surface slab is shown\nfor the range of \u0393mech that we consider. Regions, that are first\naffected by the mechanical heating input, are the ones where\n\u0393mech is comparable to the surface heating without mechanical\ninput (see Fig-2). This behavior can be traced by following the\nlocation of the dashed vertical lines (where \u0393mech = \u0393total,surface )\nand comparing the values of \u0393mech to the total surface heating\ncontours in Fig. 3. It is clear that whenever the value of \u0393mech is\ncomparable to the total surface heating, the temperature contours\nbecome almost vertical in the n \u2212 G0 plane in Fig. 3. The locations where \u0393mech = \u0393total,surface are marked by the dashed vertical\n\nlog10 [\u0393mech /erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 ]\nlog10 [nc /cm\u22123 ]\n\n-24\n0.6\n\n-22\n1.9\n\n-20\n3.2\n\n-18\n4.5\n\n-16\n5.9\n\nTable 2. Estimated values of gas density, where clouds with\nlower densities (listed in the bottom row), the shape and equilibrium temperature of the contours of Fig. 1 are significantly\neffected by \u0393mech (top row). For \u0393mech < 10\u221218 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 , the\nfitting parameters for log10 G0 = 2 are used. For higher mechanical heating rates, those for log10 G0 = 5 are used since in that\nregion of the parameter space \u0393mech is more relevant to high G0 .\n\nlines where n = nc ( see Table 2). For instance, in the first panel\nin Fig. 3 (\u0393mech = 10\u221224 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 ), regions where temperatures increase significantly are when \u0393total,surface < 10\u221224 erg\ncm\u22123 s\u22121 (see Fig. 3, and compare first panel in Fig. 3 to the middle panel in Fig-1). Also we notice that the temperature increases\nfrom \u223c 3000 K (for G0 \u223c 102 ) to \u223c 10000 K at the density\nn = nc , whereas it increases from \u223c 5000 K (for G0 \u223c 105.0 ) to\n\u223c 7000 K at the same density. This can be explained by the fact\nthat heating at the surface is mainly due to photo-electric heating, thus as G0 increases (for a fixed n), the amount total heating\nincreases. Hence a fixed amount of mechanical heating would\ncontribute less to the total heating budget, leading to a lower increase in the surface temperature. Subsequent panels in Fig. 3\nwhich correspond to higher amounts of \u0393mech can be interpreted\nin the same fashion. The main feature of these panels is the shift\nin the position of the line marking n = nc towards higher densities. In the last panel where \u0393mech = 10\u221216 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 , the\nwhole parameter space is dominated by mechanical heating.\nRegions with a SFR of \u223c 1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 are dominated by mechanical heating up to densities of \u223c 103 cm\u22123 . In Extreme starburst, where SFR of \u223c 1000 M\u2299 yr\u22121 are possible, all clouds with\nn < 105.5 cm\u22123 become dominated by mechanical heating. In\nboth cases, surface temperatures of & 5000 K are reached, and\nthe temperature contours become independent of FUV heating.\n3.1.2. Temperatures deep into the cloud\n\nNow we turn our attention to the molecular region. The solution\nwas terminated well beyond AV \u223c 1 mag (where mainly atomic\nand radicals exist) at AV = 20 mag (where everything is molec5\n\n\fKazandjian et. al: Diagnostics of PDRs with Mechanical Heating\n\nFig. 3. Surface temperature (for Z = Z\u2299 ) for different values of mechanical heating. Each panel shows the surface temperature\ncontours for a different value of \u0393mech mentioned at the top of each panel. In probing the effect of mechanical heating, each panel\nshould be compared to the middle panel of Fig. 1 which is also for Z = Z\u2299 . Different parts of the parameter space in n and G0 are\naffected differently, depending mainly on the gas density. For \u0393mech < 10\u221221 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 , regions in density with n < 103 cm\u22123 have\ntheir temperatures increase significantly. The vertical dashed red lines mark densities n = nc where \u0393mech = \u0393total,surface . The location\nof these lines moves from very low densities ( n \u223c 100 .5 cm\u22123 ) to very high densities ( n > 105 cm\u22123 ) as \u0393mech increases from 10\u221224\nto 10\u221216 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 , sweeping the parameter space in density (for a certain grid) from left to right. In general the contour lines\nat n = nc become vertical, indicating that the surface temperature becomes independent of G0 . In subsequent plot, those lines are\nplotted only for Z = Z\u2299 grids, since the fits from which n = nc were derived were done only for solar metallicity.\nular). As the FUV radiation penetrates the cloud, it is attenuated\nby dust absorption. Thus, the photo-electric heating that was the\ndominant at the surface, rapidly becomes less important and almost vanishes because (a) \u0393photo has a exp (\u2212AV ) dependence on\nAV , and (b) the heating efficiency \u01eb becomes very small as electron abundances decrease significantly by recombination. Thus,\nin the absence of \u0393mech , heating by cosmic rays and dust (especially at high G0 ) become the dominant ones in the molecular\nregion.\nIn Fig. 4 we show contours of the equilibrium temperature\nat AV = 20. In the absence of any mechanical heating, and in\ncontrast to the situation for the surface slab, the topology of the\ncontours is quite simple. The highest temperatures, with a maximum of \u223c 80 K, are in the upper right corner at n = 106 cm\u22123 and\nG0 = 106 . Temperatures decrease monotonously along the diagonal until they reach 10 K, which is the minimum tempera6\n\nture we allowed for. The main characteristic of a PDR is that\nthe surface is heated to high temperatures, which is a thin layer.\nBeyond this layer, in the transition zone, the temperature drops\nsharply. Although the temperature profile in Fig. 4 is simple, it is\ncounter-intuitive. We might expect the temperature to decrease\nas the density increases at a fixed G0 , but the opposite occurs.\nWe explain this by the fact that as n increases, the coupling between gas and dust also increases. Dust temperature depends on\nG0 and decreases as a function of AV . Nevertheless, for very high\nG0 > 103 , the decreasing dust temperatures are still high enough\nto heat the gas (\u223c 30 K).\nThe temperature profile throughout the cloud is shown in\nFig. 5 for the selected models M1 to M4. The temperature generally decreases as a function of AV . For some models which\nhave high mechanical heating rates, the temperature increases\nand then saturates at higher values than those obtained at for\n\n\fKazandjian et. al: Diagnostics of PDRs with Mechanical Heating\n\nFig. 4. Temperature at AV = 20 without mechanical heating.\nHigher equilibrium temperatures are attained for dense molecular clouds (top right corner) with decreasing equilibrium temperature towards low n and G0 . Below the 20 K contour, all temperatures are set to 10 K \u2013 the minimum allowed in the code. The red\ndashed lines mark the densities n = nc where \u0393mech = \u0393total,sur f ace\nfrom Table 2.\nthe surface. As for the models whose temperature decreases, we\nsee that as the density decreases, more specifically as the ratio\nG0 /n increases, the point of saturation of the temperature gets\nshifted further away from the surface of the cloud (AV = 0 mag).\nFor instance, when looking at clouds illuminated with a high\nFUV flux of G0 = 103 , the saturation point gets shifted from\nAV \u223c 5 mag for n = 103 cm\u22123 (low density gas) to AV \u223c 2 mag\nfor n = 105.5 cm\u22123 (high density gas, compare left panels of\nFig. 5). A similar behavior is seen for the right panels which\nhave a higher FUV flux with G0 = 105 . However, we note that\nthe saturation point remains almost constant for a fixed G0 /n,\nwhich can be seen in comparing M1 and M4, where G0 /n are of\nthe same order of magnitude. The temperature saturation point\nis also related to the H/H2 and C+ /C/CO transition zones. For\nexample, along the lines (in n \u2212 G0 parameter space) where\nG0 /n = 0.003, 1 and 300, the location of the transition zones\nin the chemical species are almost unchanged.\nIn a PDR, the total heating at the surface it is dominated\nby \u0393photo, AV =0 \u223c \u0393total, AV =0 = \u0393surface , and decreases as a function of increasing AV . Also total heating generally decreases as\na function of AV . In Section. 3.1.1 it was demonstrated that mechanical heating increases the surface temperatures significantly\nwhenever \u0393mech = \u0393surface . In such situations, since mechanical\nheating is added uniformly throughout the PDR, we expect it to\nhave a stronger impact (on the physical and chemical properties)\nat high depths compared to those at the surface. Hence \u0393mech\nshould be the most dominant heating term beyond the surface,\neven more dominant than heating due to cosmic rays which attains a maximum of 10\u221221.5 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 for n = 106 cm\u22123 . In\nFig. A.1 we show the corresponding parameter grids as a function of \u0393mech ; the thermal profile in these grids has almost no\ndependence on G0 and depends solely on n.\nIn order to illustrate the degree by which \u0393mech increases temperatures throughout the cloud, we look at the curves in Fig. 5\ncorresponding to \u0393mech , 0. We note that for densities where\n\u0393mech = \u0393surface , listed in Table 2, gas temperatures increase by\nalmost two orders of magnitude for the low density models M1\n\nand M2, and by at least one order of magnitude for the high\ndensity models M3 and M4. In fact, it suffices to have a mechanical heating rate 10 to 100 times smaller than the total heating at the cloud surface for gas temperatures to increase by a\nfactor of \u223c2 (for high densities) and up to a factor of \u223c10 (for\nlow densities). Thus even relatively small mechanical heating\nrates will substantially modify the physical parameters deduced\nfrom a pure PDR model. In a continuous starburst with an SFR\n= 1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (which corresponds to \u0393mech \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u221220 erg cm\u22123\ns\u22121 using Eq. 1), the mechanical luminosity (heating) is about\n1% of the bolometric luminosity (Leitherer et al., 1999). Which\nimplies that the ratio of mechanical luminosity to UV luminosity\n(where the emission of star forming regions peak) is larger than\n1% . Especially if we consider higher a SFR \u223c 10M\u2299 yr\u22121 which\ntranslates to a \u0393mech \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u221219 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 . Assuming that\nhalf the UV radiation is absorbed by the ISM of the galaxy, we\nwould still be in the range where \u0393mech is at least 1% of the surface heating (which is due to UV radiation), thus significantly\naltering the equilibrium temperatures of PDRs.\n\nFig. 5. Gas temperature as a function of the visual extinction for\nselected models. In the top two panels, for \u0393mech > 10\u221222 erg\ncm\u22123 s\u22121 (green and orange curves) the transition from H to H2\ndoes not occur. For the high density models the transition fails\nonly for M4 when \u0393mech > 10\u221217 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 .\n\n3.2. Molecular gas tracers\n\nNow that we have determined the degree to which mechanical\nheating alters the thermal properties of PDRs, we examine its effect on the chemical properties. Molecular clouds consist mainly\nof molecular hydrogen which is not directly observable except\nunder very special circumstances. Thus, we must depend on the\n(sub)millimeter line emission from various transitions of much\nless abundant tracer molecules. Each molecular line represents\nits own critical density and temperature.\nIn the following sections, we will consider the effect of mechanical heating on a few species commonly used as tracers.\n7\n\n\fKazandjian et. al: Diagnostics of PDRs with Mechanical Heating\n\nThese are CO for relatively low gas densities and HCO+ , HCN,\nand HNC for relatively high densities, in addition to H2 O which\nhas been also recently observed in very dense gas environments\nn \u223c 106 cm\u22123 .\n3.2.1. CO\n\nProperties of molecular H2 gas are generally studied through observations of CO, which is the next most abundant species. The\ncritical density (ncr [5] ) for the ground-state J=1-0 12 CO transition is ncr \u223c 2000 cm\u22123 . This is in the middle section of range\nof densities n considered in our grids. Thus, the response of CO\nto mechanical heating may have important consequences for estimates of the amount of molecular gas and, for instance, may\nalso explain the high gas temperature of 100-150 K which have\nbeen estimated for molecular gas in the centers of galaxies with\ndensities of 100-1000 cm\u22123 (Israel, 2009).\nIn Fig. 6 we show the abundance of CO as a function of depth\ninside the cloud. For the models with densities close to ncr (M1\nand M2), CO abundances decrease sharply for \u0393mech > 10\u221218 erg\ncm\u22123 s\u22121 and almost disappears when \u0393mech > 10\u221220 erg cm\u22123\ns\u22121 , where xCO < 10\u221213 caused by very high temperatures\nT > 10000 K (abundances of species relative to the total number\nof hydrogen nuclei are denoted by xi = ni /(nH + 2nH2 )). At such\nhigh temperatures, no molecules, including CO, are formed. This\nis due to the very low abundance of H2 which drops from \u223c 0.5\nto \u223c 10\u22129 beyond the radical region. This drop breaks the chemical network which leads to the formation of CO. In addition,\nthe higher abundances of the ionic species H+3 and He+ enhance\nthe destruction of CO through the reactions H+3 + CO \u2192 HCO+\n+ H2 and He+ + CO \u2192 O + C+ + He. On the other hand, for\n\u0393mech \u2264 10\u221218 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 the first obvious effect of mechanical heating on CO is the shift of the C/CO transition zone towards the surface of the slab. This shift is caused by the enhanced\nabundance of O2 and OH and higher temperatures in the radical\nregion (see Fig. 6).\nIn the high density models M3 and M4, the abundance of CO\ndecreases by a factor of two as \u0393mech increases from 10\u221218 erg\ncm\u22123 s\u22121 to 10\u221217 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 . As \u0393mech is pushed further to\n10\u221216 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 xCO decreases from 10\u22124 to 10\u221216 for M3\nand becomes under-abundant for M4 (xCO < 10\u221212 ). This behaviour can be explained by the enhanced abundance of the\nionised species He+ and H+3 , which destroy CO through ionneutral reactions. Also, the significant drop in abundance of H\nand HCO (by three orders of magnitude) reduce the formation\nof CO through the reactions H + HCO \u2192 CO + H2 and O + C2\n\u2192 CO + C.\nIn Figs. 7 and A.2, the column density of CO is shown without and with increasing values of mechanical heating respectively. The general trend is an increase in N(CO) whenever the\nadded \u0393mech is comparable to the surface heating of a PDR with\nno mechanical heating. This occurs at densities (nc ) marked by\nvertical dashed lines in Fig. A.2. For higher densities in the grids\n(to the right of these lines) \u0393mech < \u0393surface and the opposite is\ntrue for lower densities (to the left the lines). At densities a factor of 3 higher than nc (a distance of 0.5, in log10 scale, to the\nright of nc ) where log10 n = log10 nc + 0.5 we can see a change\nin the shape of the contours in N(CO). This change corresponds\nto an increase up to a factor of two in N(CO), with no noticable change in regions where log10 n > log10 nc + 0.5. From our\nfits of surface heating these regions have \u0393surface < \u0393mech /20. It\n5\nThe critical density ncr should not be confused with nc , defined earlier, which is the gas density where \u0393mech = \u0393total,surface\n\n8\n\nis also noticed that the increase of N(CO) is more pronounced\nfor high values of G0 /n as \u0393mech increases (compare left and\nright panel of Fig. 6). We can explain this by looking at the the\nC+ /C/CO transition zone, which gets shifted towards the surface\nof the cloud as \u0393mech dominates. This shift is more pronounced\nfor higher G0 , thus resulting in more CO in the column of H we\nare considering (N(H) = 1.8 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 ).\nFor conditions similar to that of the Milky Way, SFR \u223c\n1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 which corresponds to a \u0393mech of 2 \u00d7 10\u221220 erg cm\u22123\ns\u22121 , N(CO) estimates would be marginally ( \u223c 20% ) lower\nwhen \u0393mech is not taken into account. However, for starbursts\nwith n \u223c 104 cm\u22123 and G0 \u223c 103 and a significantly higher\nSFR (\u223c 50 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) the N(CO) estimates would be a factor of\ntwo less when the \u0393mech of 1 \u00d7 10\u221218 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 is ignored\n(compare Fig. 7 to the panel corresponding to \u0393mech = 10\u221218 erg\ncm\u22123 s\u22121 in Fig. A.2, where the N(CO) contour is shifted to the\nright, from n \u223c 103 to n \u223c 104.5 cm\u22123 ). For low metallicity\ngrids we considered Z = 0.5Z\u2299 , which may represent systems\nsuch as dwarf galaxies (where the metallicity may be as low as\n0.1 Z\u2299 ),the increase in N(CO) may be up to one order of magnitude, reaching 1017 cm\u22122 . This occurs even for a low mechanical\nheating rates corresponding to an SFR of \u223c 1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . The increase in N(CO) is visible in the central part of the parameter\nspace (compare the grids when \u0393mech = 10\u221221 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 and\n\u0393mech = 10\u221220 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 in Fig. A.4). In contrast, for the highest metallicity we considered, the Z = 2Z\u2299 grids, which represents a more likely condition for galactic centers, the increase is\nless prominent even for the extreme mechanical heating rates of\n\u0393mech = 10\u221217 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 corresponding to \u223c 500 M\u2299 yr\u22121\n(see Fig. A.3).\nThus, we conclude that we would potentially severely underestimate the amount of CO in the system if mechanical heating\nis ignored, especially for metallicities less than Z\u2299 , i.e. in dwarf\ngalaxies.\n3.2.2. H2 O\n\nUntil the launch of the Herschel Space Observatory, it was\nnot possible to observe water lines in the far-infrared from\nextra-galactic sources, as their emission is blocked by the\nEarth's atmosphere. Now, water line emission has been detected by several Herschel key programs, and a striking example is provided by the water lines observed in Markarian 231\n(Gonz\u00e1lez-Alfonso et al., 2010). In this object, water lines intensities are comparable to those of the CO lines. This is very\ndifferent from what is observed for, e.g., the star-burst galaxy\nM82 (Weiss et al., 2010) and the Orion Bar in the Milky Way\n(Habart et al., 2010).\nWater can be formed through a neutral-neutral reaction\nchain, O + H2 \u2192 OH + H, followed by OH + H2 \u2192 H2 O + H.\nIn order to obtain significant abundances, the medium has to be\nmolecular and sufficiently warm, as the reactions have barriers\nof \u223c 2000 K. In X-ray exposed environments, it is possible to\nobtain a significant water abundance xH2 O \u223c 10\u221210 at high temperatures (T \u223c 3000 K), produced by an ion-molecule reaction\nchain. A recent paper by Meijerink et al. (2011) shows that water\nproduction can be enhanced by an order of magnitude in these\nwarm atomic environments, when the grains are stripped from\ntheir ice layers, as is possibly the case in violent environments\naround an AGN.\nAs we have seen in the previous sections, the temperatures\nin the molecular regions of the mechanically heated PDR can be\nincreased to temperatures T >> 100 K, which is favorable for\nthe production of water through the neutral reaction chain.\n\n\fKazandjian et. al: Diagnostics of PDRs with Mechanical Heating\n\nabundance of H2 O is enhanced by at least one order of magnitude when \u0393mech > 10\u221217 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 . The reference grid\nfor the column density of H2 O at solar metallicity (without mechanical) heating is shown in Fig. 9. In comparing this reference grid to Figs. A.5, A.6 and A.7 (corresponding to grids for\nlower and higher metallicities), the column densities range between N(H2 O) \u223c 1014 (very low densities, n < 101 cm\u22123 )\nand up to 1016.5 cm\u22122 (n > 102 cm\u22123 ). These column densities increase when the gas density if close to n = nc especially for \u0393mech > 10\u221219 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 where an optimum of\n(N(H2 O) \u223c 1018 cm\u22122 ) is reached (see last row of Fig. A.5).\nWhen the mechanical heating rate becomes too high (in the regions where n << nc ), the column densities drop again, because\nthere is insufficient H2 , which is destroyed through collisional\ndissociation, to form water. Therefore, one finds that this optimum moves from lower to higher densities for increasing mechanical heating rates.\nThus, the high column densities of H2 O accompanied by\nhigh temperatures make this molecule an excellent diagnostic\ntool for galaxy environments where mechanical heating dominates.\n\nFig. 6. CO abundance as a function of AV for selected models. In all the diagrams, the C/CO transition zone is shifted towards the surface as a function of increasing \u0393mech . For M1\nand M2, the abundance of CO is below the displayed range for\n\u0393mech > 10\u221220 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 (these curves are not shown). The\nother curves almost overlap except for \u0393mech = 10\u221220 erg cm\u22123\ns\u22121 . In models M3 and M4 the abundance of CO drops slightly\nbeyond the transition zone compared to the case of no mechanical heating. The curves overlap except for \u0393mech = 10\u221216 erg\ncm\u22123 s\u22121 where the C+ /C/CO transition does not fully take place.\n\nFig. 8. H2 O abundance as a function of AV for selected models.\n\n3.2.3. HCN and HNC\n\nFig. 7. CO total column density up to N(H) = 1.8 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 or\nAV \u223c 10 mag for Z = Z\u2299 without mechanical heating.\nIn Fig. 8 the abundance of H2 O is shown as a function of\ndepth. The low-density models are marginally affected as long\nas \u0393mech < 10\u221220 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 . For higher mechanical heating rates the H/H2 transition does not occur, thus H2 O does not\nform. However, the impact on the abundance of H2 O is more\nsignificant for the the high-density (M3 and M4), where the\n\nThe critical density for the HCN and HNC J = 1-0 collisional\nexcitation by H is \u223c 1 \u00d7 106 and \u223c 0.5 \u00d7 106 cm\u22123 respectively.\nTogether with their relatively high abundance, makes them valuable high gas density tracers. Here we will be first looking at the\nabundances of HNC and HCN, xHNC and xHCN respectively up\nto AV = 20 mag. Then we will study the effect of mechanical\nheating on the column density ratios of these two species.\nAlthough included for completeness in Figs. 10 and 11, the\nlow-density models M1 and M2 are of no physical interest,\nsince they refer to densities at least two order of magnitude\nbelow the critical density of HCN and HNC. The more relevant high-density models M3 and M4 show (in contrast to the\n9\n\n\fKazandjian et. al: Diagnostics of PDRs with Mechanical Heating\n\nFig. 9. H2 O total column density up to N(H) = 1.8\u00d71022 cm\u22122 or\nAV \u223c 10 mag for Z = Z\u2299 without mechanical heating.\n\nlow-density models), an increase by four orders of magnitude\nin xHCN when \u0393mech exceeds 10\u221218 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 ; whereas an\nincrease of three orders in xHNC is observed. The increase in\nthe abundance of HCN was also noted by Loenen et al. (2008)\nand Meijerink et al. (2011). Mechanical heating causes the equilibrium temperature, in the molecular region, to increase from\n100 K, when \u0393mech = 10\u221218 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 , to \u223c 900 K when\n\u0393mech = 10\u221216 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 (see Fig. 5). Consequently HNC is\nconverted more effectively to HCN via the reaction HNC + H\n\u2192 HCN + H whose activation barrier of \u223c 200 K is surpassed\n(Schilke et al., 1992). This explains the drop in the fractional\nabundance of HNC with respect to HCN with xHNC /xHCN \u223c 0.1.\nThe abundance of HCN and HNC increases by few orders of\nmagnitude with increasing \u0393mech . This increase is because of the\nenhanced production of both species via the neutral-neutral reaction H2 + CN \u2192 HCN + H. Also HCN and HNC are formed with\nequal probability through recombination reactions of HCNH+ ,\nwhich has been also noted by Aalto (2005). These two processes are more dominant than the reaction HNC + H \u2192 HCN\n+ H, which is just a re-shuffling the bonds of HNC that leaves\nxHCN + xHNC constant. However HNC + H \u2192 HCN + H is responsible for the bias in the abundance of HCN with respect to\nHNC.\nNow we look at the column density ratio N(HNC)/N(HCN)\nin order to gauge the effects of mechanical heating in the\nG0 \u2212 n parameter space. These are computed by integrating\nxHNC and xHCN up to N(H) = 1.8 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 and taking\ntheir ratio. The same column density is considered for the other\nmetallicities when the ratio N(HNC)/N(HCN) is computed. In\nFig. 12 the column density ratio of HNC to HCN is shown\nfor the whole grid with no mechanical heating (pure PDR).\nSince HCN is a good tracer for dense molecular clouds with\nn \u2265 104 cm\u22123 (Solomon et al., 1992), we focus on that part of\nthe parameter space for this diagnostic. In the absence of mechanical heating, in this range of density, N(HNC)/N(HCN) <\n1 for all G0 . When mechanical heating is added, specifically for\n\u0393mech larger than 10\u221219 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 , the column density ratio\nstarts decreasing even more with almost no dependence on G0 .\nFor instance, in the upper right corner N(HNC)/N(HCN) decreases from 0.7 to 0.55 (see Fig. A.8). This decrease affects\nregions where log10 n = log10 nc + 1.0. At log10 n = log10 nc\n10\n\nFig. 10. HNC abundance as a function of AV for selected models.\nIn the top panels the curves for \u0393mech > 10\u221222 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 are\nnot shown since the C+ /C/CO transition does not take place.\n\nFig. 11. HCN abundance as a function of AV for selected models.\nThe same convention of Fig. 10 are used.\n\n(dashed vertical lines in Fig. A.8) \u0393mech = \u0393surface as described in\nSect. 3.1.1, so mechanical heating dominates everywhere in the\ncloud. Whereas at log10 n = log10 nc + 1.0 mechanical heating is\nup to 100 times smaller than the total heating at the surface of\nthe pure PDR case. For the largest \u0393mech considered 10\u221216 erg\ncm\u22123 s\u22121 the N(HNC)/N(HCN) decreases below 0.1 over the\nwhole parameter space (see Fig. A.8). This is also observed for\nthe other metallicities in Figs. A.10 and A.9.\n\n\fKazandjian et. al: Diagnostics of PDRs with Mechanical Heating\n\nFig. 12. HNC/HCN integrated column density ratios (integrated\nup to N(H) = 1.8 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 or AV \u223c 10 mag for Z = Z\u2299 )\nwithout mechanical heating. The column density ratio decreases\nfrom left to right. For dense molecular clouds, the ratio is \u223c0.7\nand it is almost constant as a function of G0 .\n\nThus, we find that the ratio N(HNC)/N(HCN) is sensitive\nto low mechanical heating rates, a factor of a hundred smaller\nthan the total heating at the surface of a pure PDR. For higher\nmechanical heating rates that are 20 times smaller than those at\nthe surface, N(HNC)/N(HCN) decrease at least by a factor of\ntwo.\n\nders of magnitude compared to the other reactions. However an\nincrease of one to four orders of magnitude in xHCO+ is observed\nfor AV < 5 mag. This contributes significantly to the column\ndensity of HCO+ in clouds with low N(H), which could make a\nsignificant impact on the interpretation of line ratios for clouds\nwith small column densities as opposed to those with high N(H).\nLooking at the column density ratios of HCN to HCO+ ,\nN(HCN)/N(HCO+ ), we see in Fig. 14 a non-trivial dependence.\nThe ratio varies from 10\u22120.7 (in the high-density and high-UV\nflux zone) to 100.7 (in the high-density, moderate- to low-UV\nflux zone).\nAn interesting feature of this column density ratio, quite\ndifferent from the HNC/HCN situation, is the fact that the\nN(HCN)/N(HCO+ ) ratio increases to \u223c 10 and \u223c 103 , as\nopposed to a decrease of only a factor of two in the ratio\nN(HNC)/N(HCN) as a function of increasing \u0393mech . For high\ndensities when \u0393mech > 10\u221220 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 the contours become\nalmost parallel for log10 nc < log10 n < log10 nc + 1.0. This implies that the N(HCN)/N(HCO+ ) ratio does not depend on G0 /n\n(as far as this ratio is concerned), but is dominated by mechanical heating down to values \u223c 100 times smaller than the surface heating of a pure PDR. This is shown in Fig. A.11 where\nN(HCN)/N(HCO+ ) ranges between 10 and 104 in the density\nrange mentioned. Similar behavior is seen for the other metallicities considered.\nThis, and the fact that N(HCN)/N(HCO+ ) is very sensitive\nto very small values of mechanical heating makes this ratio an\nexcellent diagnostic for mechanically heated regions.\n\n3.2.4. HCN/HCO+\n\nHCO+ is another high density gas tracer with ncr \u223c 105 cm\u22123 for\nJ=1-0 transition. It has been suggested that in AGNs, where\nX-ray heating dominates, HCN is less abundant than HCO+\n(Lepp & Dalgarno, 1996), suggesting that the HCN/HCO+ ratio is a diagnostic for the determination of the physical nature\nof a source object. A detailed study of the effect of cosmic rays\n(Meijerink et al., 2011) shows that the abundance of HCO+ is inhibited by high cosmic ray rates. Since cosmic rays have a large\npenetrating depth, they may raise the temperature of clouds up to\nlarge column densities. Since \u0393mech is added uniformly throughout the slab and the temperatures are likewise enhanced, a behavior similar to that caused by cosmic rays should be seen. In\na similar fashion as for HNC and HCN, we look at abundances\nand column density ratios with and without mechanical heating\nto see how it affects the N(HCN)/N(HCO+ ) ratios.\nIn the low- density models (top row of Fig. 13) a slight increase in the abundance of HCO+ is observed up to \u0393mech =\n10\u221222 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 . This is caused by a slightly slower destruction rate of HCO+ through the reaction HCO+ + e\u2212 \u2192 CO +\nH. For \u0393mech > 10\u221222 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 , the two orders of magnitude drop in the abundance of HCO+ in the molecular region is\ncaused mainly by ion-neutral reactions with H2 O, HCN (which\nwe demonstrated to increase in the previous section) and C. The\nabundance of HCO+ is unaffected by \u0393mech in M3 and M4 unless\nit is larger than 10\u221217 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 . For that amount of mechanical heating xHCO+ becomes \u223c 10\u221211 beyond the radical region. In\nthis case, the reactions H2 O + HCO+ \u2192 CO + H3 O+ and HCN +\nHCO+ \u2192 HCNH+ + CO dominate (again because of enhanced\nabundances of H2 O and HCN) in destroying HCO+ by two or-\n\nFig. 13. HCO+ abundance as a function of AV for selected models.\n\n4. Conclusion and discussion\nThe goal of this paper is to assess when we should take into\naccount mechanical heating in modeling the observed line emission properties of the interstellar medium in PDRs. We have calculated the equilibrium thermal and chemical properties of in11\n\n\fKazandjian et. al: Diagnostics of PDRs with Mechanical Heating\n\nFig. 14. HCN/HCO+ integrated column density ratios (integrated up to N(H) = 1.8\u00d71022 cm\u22122 or AV \u223c 10 mag for Z = Z\u2299 )\nwithout mechanical heating.\n\nterstellar clouds as 1D semi-infinite slabs for a large range of\nhydrogen gas densities (1 < n < 106 cm\u2212 3) and radiation fields\n(0.3 < G0 < 106 ). As a result, we covered more or less all conditions physically relevant for the ISM, from the diffuse ISM in\nthe outskirts of quiescent galaxies (G0 < 1, n = 1 \u2212100 cm\u22123 ), to\nthe dense, UV-exposed environments (G0 \u223c 105 , n \u223c 105.5 cm\u22123 )\nof active galaxy centers. We have also explored three levels of\nheavy-element abundance, Z = 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0Z\u2299 , thus considering the low metallicities of dwarf galaxies as well as the\nenhanced metallicities in galaxy centers. We have done this by\nadding a mechanical heating term resulting from dissipating turbulence of supernovae. The heating rates included are between\n10\u221224 < \u0393mech < 10\u221216 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 , which corresponds to starformation rates ranging from SFR \u223c 0 to \u223c 1000 M\u2299 yr\u22121 under\nthe assumptions explained in section 2.1. We first explored the\neffect on the thermal balance at the surface and deep into the\ncloud at high column densities, and then the chemistry of a few\ncommonly observed species in the ISM of galaxies, namely, CO,\nH2 O, HCN, HNC, and HCO+ . We demonstrated that mechanical heating radically changes the resulting chemical and thermal\nstructure. The following conclusions can be drawn :\n(i) The equilibrium temperature in a PDR is significantly altered,\ni.e., increased by an order of magnitude, for ratios \u0393mech /n1.5 \u223c\n10\u221225 erg cm\u22124.5 s\u22121 . This is a lower bound in the sense that\nwhen \u0393mech /n1.5 = 10\u221225 the temperature inside the cloud (even\nfor the densest clouds n \u223c 106 cm\u22123 ) increases by a factor of\n10. Thus, \u0393mech must be taken into account while solving for the\nequilibrium state of a PDR. In translating this relation into one\nrelating gas density to the star formation rate, it can be expressed\nas SFR/n3/2 = 7 \u00d7 10\u22126 . For higher values the temperature increases even more. Also, the H/H2 transition may not occur for\nvery high mechanical heating rates (\u0393mech /n1.5 \u226b 10\u221225 ), especially for the low density clouds with n \u223c 103 cm\u22123 .\n(ii) Mechanical heating rates that are two orders of magnitudes\nsmaller than the surface heating nevertheless are high enough\nto increase the temperature by an order of magnitude in lowdensity clouds and up to a factor of two in high-density clouds\nn \u223c 106 cm\u22123 . For instance, inclusion of a mechanical heating\nrate of 10\u221218 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 in the high-density cloud models M3\nand M4 of Meijerink & Spaans (2005) increases the tempera12\n\ntures inside the clouds from T \u223c 30 K to \u223c 100 K and from\nT \u223c 70 K to \u223c 110 K, respectively. Such heating rates \u0393mech\nare expected to occur in star-burst galaxies, and correspond to\nan SN rate of approximately 0.3 per year and an SFR rate of 9.4\nM\u2299 yr\u22121 (Loenen et al. (2008)).\n(iii) We observe that N(CO) is easily doubled when mechanical\nheating is included in modeling PDRs, especially for gas with\nn \u223c 103 cm\u22123 . As such, mechanical heating should be considered, when interpreting observed CO data. We also observe that\nthe implied column density strongly depends on metallicity. This\ncolumn density decreases from 1018 cm\u22122 at solar metallicity\nto 1017 cm\u22122 at half-solar metallicity; whereas it increases up\nto 1019 cm\u22122 at double-solar metallicity. This is particularly interesting for galaxy centers where the metallicity is expected to\nbe higher than that of the solar neighborhood.\n(iv) Our results show that the brightness of emission lines observed in galaxy centers may at least partly be due to high\nmechanical heating rates. The models with Z = 2Z\u2299 require\nhigher column densities, and temperatures are enhanced by a\nfactor 2 to 10. It also suggests that CO column densities in lowmetallicity dwarf galaxies are even lower than assumed otherwise. Mechanical heating excites the gas to high temperatures,\nbut the column density N(CO) is significantly lower (by almost\nan order of magnitude) compared to Z = Z\u2299 ). In addition to that,\nthe relative gas fraction is lower in dwarf galaxies, as supernovae\neasily disperse gas from the galaxy.\n(v) Like CO, H2 O also exhibits an increase in column density.\nThe temperature increase induced by mechanical heating results\nin implied column densities N(H2 O) three orders of magnitude\nhigher (up to \u223c 1018 cm\u22122 ) compared to models without mechanical heating. This gives H2 O approximately the same column\ndensity as CO, for the highest mechanical heating rate. Based\non this, H2 O lines could also provide an excellent diagnostic\nin combination with CO, when studying mechanical heating in\ngalaxies.\n(vi) HCN, HNC, HCO+ line ratios have been used to discriminate between PDRs and XDRs (Meijerink et al., 2007;\nLoenen et al., 2008). Although we do not compute line intensity\nratios in this paper, we have studied the signature of mechanical\nheating on the integrated column density ratios of HNC/HCN\nand HCN/HCO+. We find that model HNC/HCN column density ratios decrease by a factor of at least 5 for gas densities\nn > 105 cm\u22123 , when \u0393mech > 10\u221217 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 . This effect is mitigated in clouds subjected to lower mechanical rates,\nbut only at densities n < 104 cm\u22123 . HCN and HNC do not\nproduce significant line emission at these densities as they are\nwell below the critical density for excitation. On the other hand,\nthe HCN/HCO+ column density ratio strongly depends on mechanical heating. This ratio increases from \u223c 10 to \u223c 100,\nfor dense molecular clouds (n > 105 cm\u22123 ), when \u0393mech =\n10\u221219 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 and up to 104 for \u0393mech = 10\u221218 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121\nfor Z = 0.5, 1.0, 2Z\u2299 . In general for these conditions the column\ndensities of HCO+ decrease from \u223c 1014 cm\u22122 to \u223c 1013 cm\u22122 ,\nthose for HCN increase from \u223c 1013 cm\u22122 to \u223c 1016.5 cm\u22122 ,\nwhereas N(HNC) drop to \u223c 1013 cm\u22122 from \u223c 1014 cm\u22122 . The\nabundance of HCO+ drops by at least three orders of magnitude\nat column densities higher NH > 1.8 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 for the aforementioned \u0393mech . In galaxy centers, higher AV are easily possible compared to Z = Z\u2299 . This translates into higher N(H), which\nin turn would imply a smaller N(HCO+ ) compared to N(HCN).\nHence resulting in even higher HCN/HCO+ column density ratio. The lack of HCO+ in combination with bright HCN line\nemission might be useful in tracing regions with high mechanical heating rates.\n\n\fKazandjian et. al: Diagnostics of PDRs with Mechanical Heating\n\nThe integrated column density ratios do not translate directly into line intensity ratios. Instead, one should compute\nthese ratios by solving the radiative transfer equations. We will\nconsider predictions for the actual line intensities of HCN,\nHNC and HCO+ in the next paper, where we will also assess time-dependent effects. The equilibrium treatment is certainly valid for the low-metallicity dwarf galaxies, and the\nbenchmark-metallicity of solar neighborhood galaxy discs, but\nthis may not be the case for the high-metallicity galaxy centers, where the chemical, thermal, and dynamical timescales are\nquite comparable in the inner < 100 pc, especially at densities n < 103 cm\u22123 . For example, the formation timescale of H2\n(Hollenbach & Tielens, 1999) is < 5 Myr at an ambient gas density n \u223c 103 cm\u22123 and a kinetic temperature of T \u223c 100 K. The\nstellar orbital periods (which stir up the ISM) are comparable to\nor shorter than this, namely between 0.1 and 15 Myr. Hence, a\ntime-dependent treatment is necessary, and we aim to accomplish this in upcoming papers by adapting the current PDRXDR code. We will allow for time-dependent chemical evolution, and couple it with an SPH code through AMUSE. As such,\nthe chemistry, gas and stellar dynamics are being evolved selfconsistently.\nAcknowledgements. M.V.K would like to thank A.G.G.M.

Temperature contours at AV = 20 for different values of mechanical heating. As mechanical heating is increased from 10\u221224\nto 10\u221216 , the temperatures increase from left to right in the grid as function of increasing mechanical heating. The temperatures to\nthe left of the highest temperature contour line are higher than the temperature of the contour curve itself, which are usually larger\nthan 10000K. The models in these regions are not very accurate since cooling effects for temperature larger than 10000K are not\nincluded properly, so we do not plot the corresponding contours.\n\n14\n\n\fKazandjian et. al: Diagnostics of PDRs with Mechanical Heating\n\nFig. A.2. log10 CO total column density (integrated up to N(H) = 1.8 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 or AV \u223c 10mag for Z = Z\u2299 ) for different values of\nmechanical heating.\n\n15\n\n\fKazandjian et. al: Diagnostics of PDRs with Mechanical Heating\n\nFig. A.3. log10 CO total column density (integrated up to N(H) = 1.8 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 or AV \u223c 20mag for Z = 2Z\u2299 ) as a function of\nmechanical heating for the double solar metallicity case.\n\n16\n\n\fKazandjian et. al: Diagnostics of PDRs with Mechanical Heating\n\nFig. A.4. log10 CO total column density (integrated up to N(H) = 1.8 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 or AV \u223c 5mag for Z = 0.5Z\u2299 ) as a function of\nmechanical heating for the low metallicity case.\n\n17\n\n\fKazandjian et. al: Diagnostics of PDRs with Mechanical Heating\n\nFig. A.5. log10 H2 O total column density (integrated up to N(H) = 1.8 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 or AV \u223c 10mag for Z = Z\u2299 ) for different values\nof mechanical heating.\n\n18\n\n\fKazandjian et. al: Diagnostics of PDRs with Mechanical Heating\n\nFig. A.6. log10 H2 O total column density (integrated up to N(H) = 1.8 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 or AV \u223c 20mag for Z = 2Z\u2299 ) as a function of\nmechanical heating for the double solar metallicity case.\n\n19\n\n\fKazandjian et. al: Diagnostics of PDRs with Mechanical Heating\n\nFig. A.7. log10 H2 O total column density (integrated up to N(H) = 1.8 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 or AV \u223c 5mag for Z = 0.5Z\u2299 ) as a function of\nmechanical heating for the low metallicity case.\n\n20\n\n\fKazandjian et. al: Diagnostics of PDRs with Mechanical Heating\n\nFig. A.8.
