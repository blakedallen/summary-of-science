Spectral shock waves that precede this asymptotic limit exhibit universal scaling\nwith Nc , with indices that can be related to Berry indices for diffraction catastrophes.\nKey words: Wilson loop, Burgers equation, random matrix\n\n1. Spectral shock waves\nRecent lattice studies [1] have provided evidence for a novel universal phenomenon in\nYang-Mills theory with a large number of colors N . For small loops, the eigenvalues of\nthe unitary Wilson operator concentrate around the point z = 1 in the complex plane,\nand spread symmetrically on the unit circle towards z = \u22121 as the area of the loop\nincreases. At some critical area, the spectral gap closes, and the corresponding level\ndensity is given by a universal function (Pearcey function), whose two arguments exhibit\nscalings in N 1/2 and N 3/4 , respectively, apparently independently on the dimensionality\nof the Yang-Mills theory. For very large loops, the level density goes towards a universal\ndistribution, reflecting disorder, as suggested long ago by Durhuus and Olesen [2]. In\na recent paper [3], we suggested a particular mechanism leading to such transition, by\nnoting that in d = 2, the spectral evolution of Wilson loops is governed by a complex\nBurgers equation\n\u2202A F + F \u2202\u03b8 F = 0,\n\n1\nF (\u03b8, A) =\n2\n\nZ\u03c0\n\nd\u03b1 \u03c1(\u03b1, A) cot((\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b1)/2)\n\n(1)\n\n\u2212\u03c0\n\nwhere the imaginary part of the resolvent F (\u03b8, A) gives spectral density \u03c1. All known\nproperties of the Durhuus and Olesen transition can be easily recovered by analyzing\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\n19 November 2018\n\n\fthe solution of Eq. (1), using the methods of complex characteristics, and following\nthe motion of singularities in the complex plane [3]. In this description, the transition\ncorresponds to the collision of two\"tsunami-like\" shock waves (associated to the edges\nof the spectrum) evolving symmetrically from z = 1 around the unit circle, to merge\nviolently at z = \u22121 at the critical area. For larger areas, the cascade of Fourier modes\nevolves in such a way that only the lowest mode, corresponding to the size of the system,\nsurvives, a phenomenon reminiscent of the inverse turbulent cascade.\n2. Non-linear diffusion, universality and colored catastrophes\nThe complex Burgers equation describes, under certain conditions, the random walk\nof eigenvalues of large unitary matrices [4].The role of the time t is played by the area\nof the loop. Writing the eigenvalues as z = ei\u03b8 , the Langevin equation corresponding to\nthe random walk of unitary matrices reads\nd\u03b8i = dBi +\n\n\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j\n1X\ndt\ncot\n2\n2\n\n(2)\n\ni6=j\n\nwhere the first term is a Brownian noise and the second is originating from the usual\nrepulsion of eigenvalues. From the Langevin equation, a Smoluchowski-Fokker-Planck\nequation is obtained using standard techniques, which, after a suitable approximation\nyields the following equation for \u03c1 [6]\n1\n\u2202t \u03c1 + \u2202\u03b8 [\u03c1H[\u03c1]] = \u2202\u03b8\u03b8 \u03c1,\n2\n\n1\nH[\u03c1] \u2261\nP.V.\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\u03c0\n\nd\u03b1\u03c1(\u03b1, A) cot\n\n\u03b8\u2212\u03b1\n,\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\u2212\u03c0\n\nwhere P.V. denotes the principal value of the integral. Eq. (3) is equivalent to the viscid\nBurgers equation, the last term playing the role of a viscosity term. This equation exhibits\nvarious scaling with N , which we now discuss.\n\u2022 Dyson gas: We rescale the density, originally normalized to N , as \u03c1 = N \u03c1\u0302, and the time\nas \u03c4 = N t. Then, in the large N limit we get [5] (equivalent to Eq. 1)\n\u2202\u03c4 \u03c1\u0302 + \u2202\u03b8 [\u03c1\u0302H[\u03c1\u0302]] = 0.\n\n(4)\n\nNote that the viscous term has disappeared, since it was dwarfed by the effective spectral\nviscosity, vs = 1/2N 1 . In this regime the evolution proceeds without collisions.\n\u2022 Dyson liquid: There is however another regime, where collisions between the eigenvalues,\ntaken into account by the viscous term, cannot be ignored. This happens in the vicinity\nof the shock waves, and seems to be responsible for the universal scaling at the edges of\nthe spectrum. To approach this limit, we set \u03c1(\u03b8, t) = N \u03b1+1 \u03c1\u0303(x, \u03c4 ) with x \u2261 N \u03b1 \u03b8 and\n\u03c4 \u2261 N 2\u03b1 t, and get\n1\n\u2202xx \u03c1\u0303.\n(5)\n2\nThis viscid complex Burgers equation allows us to describe the scaling properties of the\nspectral density in the vicinity of a shock.\n\u2202\u03c4 \u03c1\u0303(x, \u03c4 ) + N \u2202x (\u03c1\u0303H \u03c1\u0303) =\n\n1\n\nThis value of the spectral viscosity has also been obtained by Neuberger [9] using different arguments.\n\n2\n\n\fThis can be seen schematically by applying the Cole-Hopf trick to solve the equation [7].\nThe resulting spectral distribution can be written in the form\n\u03c1\u0303(x) = \u2212\n\n1\nIm \u2202x ln K(x)\nN\u03c0\n\n(6)\n\nRz\nwhere K(x) is the convolution of a Gaussian kernel with K0 (z) = exp{\u2212N\nF\u03030 (w)dw},\nwhere F\u03030 is the resolvent corresponding to the appropriate initial condition for the microscopic spectral density \u03c1\u0303. In the vicinity of the shock waves, the resolvent can be\napproximated by a polynomial of second order (gapped phase) or third order (at the\nclosure of the gap). The resulting spectral densities are therefore related to complex Airy\nor Pearcey type integrals, with well defined scaling properties.\nIn fact these scaling properties appear to be universal and manifest themselves in various physical contexts. We mention here an amusing analogy with optics. In geometric\noptics (vanishing wavelength \u03bb), the rays of light may condense on surfaces of infinite\nintensity, the so-called caustics. These correspond to stable singularities that are classified, the lowest two corresponding to fold and cusp singularities. At finite wavelength,\ninterference effects enter, and we have to use wave packets to describe the emergence of\nsingularities. Such a wave packet \u03a8 is generically of the form [8]\n\u03a8(~r, \u03bb) =\n\nx1 x2\n1\n\u03c8(\n,\n, ..)\n\u03bb\u03b2 \u03bb\u03c31 \u03bb\u03c32\n\n(7)\n\nFor the fold, \u03b2 = 1/6 and \u03c3 = 2/3, and \u03a8 is given by an Airy function, while for\nthe cusp \u03b2 = 1/4, \u03c31 = 1/2, \u03c32 = 3/4, and \u03a8 is given by a Pearcey function [8]. The\nanalogy with these \"diffractive catastrophes\" goes as follows. The limit of geometrical\noptics corresponds to the limit N = \u221e (\u03bb \u223c 1/N ). Rays of light correspond to the\n(complex) characteristics of the Burgers equation, whose envelopes correspond to the\ncaustics and are associated to singularities of Burgers equation. The universal behavior\nin the vicinity of these singularities is captured by a Pearcey function, and the particular\ncritical exponents for scaling with \"angle\" and \"area\" observed in [1] are identical to the\nBerry indices for a cusp catastrophe.\nThis work was supported by Marie Curie TOK Grant MTKD-CT-517186 \"Correlations\nin Complex Systems\" (COCOS).\n\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n\nR.
