Introduction\nString theories in the presence of a constant background field (B-field) have been often considered in the recent literature; in particular Seiberg and Witten [1] have shown they give rise\nin a suitable limit to field theories defined on a space of noncommuting variables (NCFT).\nIn turn NCFT may suffer from the lack of covariance and, when the B-field is of electric\ntype, their spectrum has severe difficulties with respect to perturbative S-matrix unitarity\n[2, 3, 4]. Usual analytic properties of amplitudes are lost as well, as a consequence of nonlocality.\nMany of these unpleasant features are not shared by the parent string theory [5, 6];\ntherefore it looks interesting to re-examine the spectrum of the latter as a first step in order\nto point out where possible differences are generated. Such an analysis does not seem to\nhave been carried out in full detail, at least to our knowledge, in spite of the huge amount of\nliterature on the subject (see for instance [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]).\nA first approach to this problem was undertaken in ref.[16], where the singularities of\nthe bosonic two-point amplitudes were studied, after a suitable off-shell continuation [17], in\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\forder to perform a comparison with the ones occurring in the corresponding noncommutative\nfield amplitudes. In particular the appearance in these amplitudes of an unphysical cut\nwhen the noncommutativity parameter involves the time variable was related to the classical\ninstability of the corresponding string theory in the presence of a background external field\nof an \"electric\" type.\nThe analysis above was generalized in [18, 19] to the four-point \"on-shell\" tachyonic\namplitude, thereby avoiding any possible trouble with off-shell continuations.\nIn the following we start considering again the bosonic string case, namely we study\nfour-string amplitudes in the presence of a background field, first at tree level and then at\none loop level, paying particular attention at the spectrum of the various singularities and\nat the related factorization properties. Later we repeat the above analysis for superstring\namplitudes, where unsatisfactory unphysical features are no longer present.\nWe consider the bosonic case first since, although affected by the well-known pathologies,\nit still exhibits in a simpler setting most of the features we shall later encounter in the better\ngrounded superstring context.\nThe motivation for looking at tree level amplitudes is prompted by the desire of exploring\nthe open string spectrum in the presence of the B-field; such a field entails the occurrence of\nextra poles which otherwise would decouple for spatial symmetry reasons. One-loop amplitudes are instead essential to capture effects from the closed string spectrum, in particular the\nopen-closed string vertices which can be obtained via factorization. These are the amplitudes\nrelated to the non-planar ones in the NCFT limit.\nIn the last part of our work such results will be extended to the superstring case, where\npathologies related to ghosts and to redundant dimensions are absent. Here a stack of N\nDp-branes is to be introduced in order to deal with the U (N ) group [20, 21] and the Bfield is chosen with non-vanishing components only in the directions of the branes. Actually\n~ , with string exchanges in\ntwo stacks of branes will be considered at a relative distance Y\nbetween them. Again the presence of the B-field will reduce part of existing symmetries and\nthereby allow the presence of further poles which would decouple otherwise. Consistency\nwith factorization properties following from unitarity will be checked explicitly. In particular\nthe two different situations, characterized by a field B of a \"magnetic\" and of an \"electric\"\ntype respectively, are discussed and compared. In the first case the theory does not exhibit\nany perturbative instability, at least in the one-loop amplitude we have considered. In the\nelectric case instead a classical instability appears in the perturbative string amplitude when\nthe \"electric\" field overcomes a critical value [22, 23, 24], due to an uncontrolled growth of\nthe oscillation of modes in the direction parallel to the field. Corresponding to this value\na violation of unitarity occurs in the form of a cut in the complex squared energy plane of\ntachyonic type.\nWhen the Seiberg-Witten limit is considered leading to an effective field theory of a\nnoncommutative type, the electric field is necessarily pushed into the instability region and\nthe resulting theory is sick.\nIn sect. 2 the bosonic case is studied, first at the tree level, pointing out the peculiarities\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\frelated to the presence of the B-field, and then at the one loop where the interplay between\nclosed and open sectors becomes apparent. Sect.3 is devoted to superstring amplitude, where\nanalogous features occur in the scattering of strings lying on two stacks of branes at a relative\n~ . When eventually the Seiberg-Witten limit is performed, several peculiarities of\ndistance Y\nnoncommutative field theories find their raison d'\u00eatre in the corresponding features of the\nparent string theory. Final comments are the content of sect.4 .\n\n2. The bosonic case\n2.1 Tree amplitudes\nBefore entering in medias res, some notations and definitions have to be recalled. The following expression\nZ\n1\nd2 z (g\u03bc\u03bd \u2202a X \u03bc \u2202 a X \u03bd \u2212 2i\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 Bij \u01ebab \u2202a X i \u2202b X j )\n(2.1)\nSbos =\n4\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 C\nis the action of a bosonic open string attached to a D-brane lying in the first p + 1 dimensions\nand coupled to an antisymmetric constant background [1, 7]. We denote by latin letters i, j, ...\nthe components along the brane. The open string parameters are:\nG = (g \u2212 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 B)g\u22121 (g + 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 B),\n2\n\n\u22121\n\n\u03b8 = \u2212(2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 ) (g + 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 B)\n\n(2.2)\n\u22121\n\nB(g \u2212 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 B)\n\n.\n\n(2.3)\n\nHere Gij and gij are the open and the closed-string metric tensors, respectively.\nWe consider for simplicity the four-tachyon tree amplitude and introduce the usual Mandelstam variables s = \u2212(k1 + k2 )2 , t = \u2212(k1 + k4 )2 and u = \u2212(k1 + k3 )2 using the metric\ntensor Gij . The tachyons are on shell, ki2 = \u2212m2 , i = 1, ..., 4.. Our open string metric\nis (\u22121, 1, ..., 1) and we choose our units so that m2 = \u22122, (\u03b1\u2032 = 1/2). As a consequence\ns + t + u = \u22128.\nThe presence of the B-field affects the familiar Veneziano expression by a phase factor\n\u0010 \u2212i\n\u0011\n\u0393(\u22121 \u2212 s/2)\u0393(\u22121 \u2212 t/2)\nA(k1 , ..., k4 ) =\nexp\n(k2 k\u03031 + k3 k\u03031 + k3 k\u03032 )\n\u0393(\u22122 \u2212 s/2 \u2212 t/2)\n2\n+ non-cyclic permutations,\n(2.4)\n\u0010\n\u0011ij\n1\nwhere (k\u0303)i = \u03b8 ij (k)j and \u03b8 ij = \u03c0 g+\u03c0B\n. ( )A denotes the antisymmetric part of a matrix.\nA\n\nNo Chan-Paton factors are considered for the time being; we restrict ourselves to the U (1)\ncase. This is not a real limitation and will be removed when considering one-loop amplitudes.\nWe are now interested in studying the pole of eq.(2.4) at s = 0. One can easily realize\nthat the relevant terms are\n\u0010 \u2212i\n\u0011\n\u0393(\u22121 \u2212 s/2)\u0393(\u22121 \u2212 t/2)\nexp\n(k2 k\u03031 + k3 k\u03031 + k3 k\u03032 )\nA(k1 , ..., k4 )|rel =\n\u0393(\u22122 \u2212 s/2 \u2212 t/2)\n2\n+ (k1 \u2194 k2 ) + (k3 \u2194 k4 ).\n(2.5)\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fThe amplitude on the pole behaves like\n\u0010 \u2212i\n\u0011h\ni\n2\n\u2212i\ni\nA(k1 , ..., k4 ) \u2243 \u2212 exp\nk3 (k\u03031 + k\u03032 ) (2 + t/2) exp( k2 k\u03031 ) + (2 + u/2) exp( k2 k\u03031 )\ns\n2\n2\n2\nk1 k\u03032\nk3 k\u03034\n2\nsin\n,\n(2.6)\n+(k3 \u2194 k4 ) = (t \u2212 u) sin\ns\n2\n2\nwhere momentum conservation and the mass shell conditions have been taken into account.\nIt is immediately clear that, in the absence of the B-field (\u03b8 ij = 0), the above residue\nvanishes: The two tachyons cannot couple to a photon while respecting Bose statistics. In\nthe presence of the B-field a nice factorization occurs of the residue as the product of two\nvertices, each carrying a Moyal phase, as expected from the result in ref.[1]. Indeed the vertex\ntachyon-tachyon-photon takes the form\nV i (k1 , k2 ) \u2243 (k1i \u2212 k2i ) sin\n\nk1 k\u03032\n,\n2\n\n(2.7)\n\nand the presence of the Moyal phase is crucial to comply with Bose statistics. We notice that\nthe transversality condition (k1 + k2 ) * V = 0 is satisfied.\n2.2 One-loop amplitudes\nWe turn now our attention to the study of one-loop amplitudes, always in the presence of a\nconstant field B. In so doing our purpose is to explore the features of closed string poles in\naddition to the open string ones.\nAt one loop the string world-sheet is the cylinder C2 = {0 \u2264 Rw \u2264 1, w = w + 2i\u03c4 }.\nThe one loop propagator with the boundary conditions imposed by the B-term, can be\nfound in [7]. If one sets w = x + iy, the relevant propagator on the boundary of the cylinder\n(x = 0, 1) can be written as\nh q 14\n|y \u2212 y \u2032 | i i\n1 \u2032 \u22121\n\u2032 \u22121\n\u03b84 (\n, ) , x 6= x\u2032 ,\nG(y, y ) = \u03b1 g log q \u2212 2\u03b1 G log\n2\nD(\u03c4 )\n2\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u2032\n\nG(y, y \u2032 ) =\n\u03c0\n\nh 1\n\u00b1i\u03b8\n|y \u2212 y \u2032 | i i\n\u01eb\u22a5 (y \u2212 y \u2032 ) \u2212 2\u03b1\u2032 G\u22121 log\n\u03b81 (\n, ) , x = x\u2032 ,\n2\nD(\u03c4 )\n2\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\n(2.8)\n(2.9)\n\nwhere q = e\u2212 \u03c4 , \u00b1 correspond to x = 1 and x = 0 respectively, and \u01eb\u22a5 (y) = sign(y) \u2212 \u03c4y .\n3\nHere \u03b81,4 (\u03bd, \u03c4 ) are Jacobi theta functions, while D(\u03c4 ) = \u03c4 \u22121 [\u03b7( \u03c4i )] and \u03b7 is the Dedekind\neta function [25].\nWith this propagator and the suitable modular measure, the amplitude for the insertion\nof N tachyonic vertex operators at x = 1 and M \u2212 N at x = 0 turns out to be [7]:\nZ \u221e\n1 \u2032\n\u22121\nd\u03c4 \u2212 d\nA1,***,M = N0\n\u03c4 2 [\u03b7(i\u03c4 )]2\u2212d q 2 \u03b1 Kg K\n\u03c4\n0\n\"\n#2\u03b1\u2032 ki G\u22121 kj\nZ\nM\nN\nY\nY\n1\n|yi \u2212 yj | i\nq 4 \u03b84 (\n\u00d7 [dy]\n, )/D(\u03c4 )\n2\u03c4\n\u03c4\ni=1 j=N +1\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\f#2\u03b1\u2032 ki G\u22121 kj\n|yi \u2212 yj | i\ne\n\u00d7\n, )/D(\u03c4 )\n\u03b81 (\n2\u03c4\n\u03c4\n1=i<j\n#2\u03b1\u2032 ki G\u22121 kj\n\"\nM\nY\n1\n|y\n\u2212\ny\n|\ni\ni\nj\ni\u01eb\n(y\n\u2212y\n)k\n\u03b8k\n, )/D(\u03c4 )\n.\ne 2 \u22a5 i j i j \u03b81 (\n\u00d7\n2\u03c4\n\u03c4\nN\nY\n\n\u2212 21 i\u01eb\u22a5 (yi \u2212yj )ki \u03b8kj\n\n\"\n\n(2.10)\n\nN +1=i<j\n\nP\nHere N0 is a normalization constant, d = p + 1, and K = N\ni=1 ki is the sum of all momenta\nassociated with the vertex operators inserted on the x = 1 boundary. The integration region\n[dy] for the variables yi will be specified later on.\nWhenever N 6= 0 and M > N , this amplitude corresponds to non-planar graphs, the\ntraces of the relevant Chan-Paton matrices being understood.\nFor electric backgrounds it is well known that problems arise when the electric field\napproaches a critical value Ecr . Beyond it a classical instability occurs [22, 23, 24] both\nfor neutral (which is the case we consider here) and for charged open strings, related to an\nuncontrolled growth of the oscillation amplitude of modes in the direction parallel to the field.\nThis phenomenon coexists with the quantum instability of purely charged strings due to\npair production in any electric field (even in a sub-critical one), which is the analog of the\nSchwinger phenomenon in particle electrodynamics. However, at variance with the latter, it\nhas no analog in particle field theory 1 . We will discuss it in subsect 3.2 .\n2.3 Closed string poles\nWe write the one-loop non-planar amplitude for a scattering of four bosonic open string\ntachyons in d = 26 (D25-brane) in the presence of a constant antisymmetric background as\nfollows:\nA = A(1, 2, 3, 4) Tr [\u03bb1 \u03bb2 ] Tr [\u03bb3 \u03bb4 ] + non-trivial permutations,\n(2.11)\nwhere the amplitude A(1, 2, 3, 4) above, after specializing eq.(2.10) (see Appendix A), takes\nthe form\n\nA=N\n\"\n\nZ\n\n1\n0\n\n[sin \u03c0\u03bd12\n\ndq\n\u22121\n\u221216 1\n[f (q 2 )] q 4 Kg K\n3\nq\n\n\u221e\nY\n\nZ\n\n1 \u2212 2q\n\n2n\u22121\n\ncos 2\u03c0\u03bd13 + q\n\n4n\u22122\n\n1\n\n\"\u221e\nY\n1\n\n1\n\nd\u03bd1\n\n0\n\n1 \u2212 2q 2n cos 2\u03c0\u03bd12 + q\n\n1\n\n\"\u221e\nY\n\n1\n\n\u0001\n4n\n\nZ\n\n\u03bd1\n\nd\u03bd2\n0\n\n] [sin \u03c0\u03bd3\n\nZ\n\n\u03bd2\n\ni\n\nd\u03bd3 e\u2212 2 [k1 \u03b8k2 (1\u22122\u03bd12 )\u2212k3 \u03b8k4 (1\u22122\u03bd3 )]\n\n0\n\n\u221e\nY\n\n1 \u2212 2q 2n cos 2\u03c0\u03bd3 + q\n\n1\n\n#\u22122\u2212(u/2) \" \u221e\nY\n\u0001\n\n1 \u2212 2q\n\n2n\u22121\n\ncos 2\u03c0\u03bd1 + q\n\n\u0001\n4n\n\n]\n\n4n\u22122\n\n1\n\n1 \u2212 2q\n\n2n\u22121\n\ncos 2\u03c0\u03bd23 + q\n\n4n\u22122\n\n#\u22122\u2212(t/2) \" \u221e\nY\n\u0001\n1\n\n1 \u2212 2q\n\n2n\u22121\n\ncos 2\u03c0\u03bd2 + q\n\n#\u22122\u2212(s/2)\n\n4n\u22122\n\n(2.12)\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n\n#\u22122\u2212(t/2)\n\n#\u22122\u2212(u/2)\n\n.\n\nIn passing, we recall that for neutral strings (q-charge on one end, \u2212q on the other), one has |Ecr | =\n1/(2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 |q|). For charges q1 6= q2 on the two boundaries, one finds that the pair production rate diverges at a\ncritical value Ecr = 1/(2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 |max qi |)\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\f1\n\n4\n\n1\n\n4\n\n2\n\n3\n\n=\n2\n\n3\n\nFigure 1: Diagram representing the amplitude A(1, 2, 3, 4)\n\nEq.(2.12) is the amplitude for a fixed order of the external momenta (see the diagram in\nfig. 1); the coordinates \u03bdi of the vertex operator insertions are taken to be cyclically ordered\nfrom zero to one on each of the two boundaries, with \u03bd4 fixed to zero in order to remove the\nresidual gauge. All possible non-trivial permutations of the labels of the external particles\nare to be summed over. The ones concerning k3 are accounted for by extending the region\nof integration over \u03bd3 from 0 to 1. Henceforth we shall denote by the symbol A(1, 2) such an\nextension (0 \u2264 \u03bd3 \u2264 1). We have expressed the amplitude using the variable q = exp[\u2212\u03c0/\u03c4 ],\nwhich is the traditional one that reference [26] uses for the spectral analysis in the case\nwithout B-field, in order to have a direct comparison. External momenta are taken to be on\nthe tachyon mass-shell. Indices are raised and lowered with the open string metric G\u22121 . We\ndefine \u03bdrs = \u03bdr \u2212 \u03bds ; K = k1 + k2 is the total momentum entering through one boundary and\nQ\nn\nleaving from the other. We also define f (x) = \u221e\nn=1 (1 \u2212 x ) as in [26].\nIt is well known that, in the case without the B-field, this amplitude presents a rich\npattern of singularities, each of them being required by unitarity, corresponding to precise\nintermediate exchanges.\nFirst of all, if one takes the amplitude A(1, 2) as an example, and analyzes it in the\nvariable s, setting \u03b8 = 0 and g = G inside the integral, one finds a series of simple poles\nwhen s equals the masses of the closed string tower. This is required by unitarity, because a\ndiagram like the one of fig.1 is topologically equivalent to a tree-level closed string exchange\nbetween the sets of particles {1, 2} and {3, 4}.\nThese poles emerge when one explores the small region of the integration over the qvariable; in particular, one easily sees that the amplitude can be written as follows\n\u221e Z 1\nX\nA(1, 2) =\ndq q \u22123+n\u2212(s/4) an (s, t, u),\n(2.13)\nn=0 0\n\nnamely\nA(1, 2) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\n1\nan (s, t, u).\n(\u22122 + n \u2212 (s/4))\n\n(2.14)\n\n\u00bfFrom this expansion one might naively conclude that poles occur at the masses s = 4n \u2212 8 =\n\u22128, \u22124, 0, * * *, which, unless canceled by the sum over permutations, would be at odds with\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\funitarity, since the expected closed string spectrum is s = \u22128, 0, * * *. Actually quantities like\na1 , a3 , ... cancel on their own, as one can check explicitly by performing the integrals over the\n\u03bdi or as a particular case of Appendix B.\nThe first thing to be checked is whether such a cancellation persists in the presence of\nthe B-field; we exhibit it here explicitly for the lowest level n = 1. The remarkable proof\nof cancellation for higher odd values of n is given in Appendix B. It is easy to realize from\neq.(2.12) that, even in the presence of the B-field, a formula analogous to (2.14) can be written\nA(1, 2) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\n1\n\u03b1n (s, t, u, k1 \u03b8k2 , k3 \u03b8k4 ).\n(\u22122 + n \u2212 (sCL /4))\n\n(2.15)\n\nWe have defined sCL = \u2212Kg\u22121 K the squared energy variable in the closed channel, which is\ndifferent from the one in the open channel s as long as B is different from zero.\nWe perform a Taylor expansion of the integrand in the expression of A up the first order\nin q and get\n\u03b11 = N\n\nZ\n\n1\n\nd\u03bd1\n\n0\n\nZ\n\n\u03bd1\n\nd\u03bd2\n\nZ\n\n1\n\ni\n\ni\n\nd\u03bd3 e\u2212 2 k1 \u03b8k2 (1\u22122\u03bd12 ) e 2 k3 \u03b8k4 (1\u22122\u03bd3 ) (sin \u03c0\u03bd12 sin \u03c0\u03bd3 )\u22122\u2212(s/2)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u00d7 [(4 + u)(cos 2\u03c0\u03bd13 + cos 2\u03c0\u03bd2 ) + (4 + t)(cos 2\u03c0\u03bd1 + cos 2\u03c0\u03bd23 )] .\n\n(2.16)\n\nR1 R1\nR1\nWe now change variables to p = \u03bd12 ; the integration region becomes 0 dp p d\u03bd1 0 d\u03bd3 .

On the contrary, for a non-vanishing \u03b8, (2.18) is different\nfrom zero. As already mentioned, this would contradict unitarity, since the pattern of the\nclosed string spectrum is unaffected by the presence of B. Now the cancellation is subtler; we\nnotice that the expression (2.18) is odd under the exchange k1 \u2194 k2 , as \u03b8 is antisymmetric\nand t \u2194 u under such an exchange (the Chan-Paton factors in (2.12) remain the same).\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fTherefore, the sum over the other three diagrams considered in (2.11) gets rid of such an\nunwanted singularity.\nThe closed poles in the non-planar diagram of fig.1 correspond to the traditional pattern.\nTo get the cancellation of the unwanted closed poles one needs to sum over permutations:\nThe expected structure is recovered only at the level of the complete four-point amplitude. 2\n2.4 Open string poles\nThe amplitude A(1, 2, 3, 4) in the case of B = 0 (or, equivalently, \u03b8 = 0) presents as well a\nseries of open string poles in the s-channel with singlet quantum numbers. They arise when\nthe \u03bdi 's on the same boundary of the diagram in fig. 1 get close to a common value.\nWhen B 6= 0, sCL 6= s and there are two variables in which singularities may occur. To\nsimplify our analysis, we single out the first non-vanishing residue in the variable sCL , \u03b10 , and\nexamine its behaviour as a function of s. The very same Taylor expansion of the integrand\nof A(1, 2) in the variable q reveals that \u03b10 is given by\n\u03b10 = N\n\nZ\n\n1\n\ndp\n0\n\nZ\n\n1\n\ni\n\ni\n\nd\u03bd3 e\u2212 2 k1 \u03b8k2 (2p\u22121) e 2 k3 \u03b8k4 (1\u22122\u03bd3 ) p (sin \u03c0p sin \u03c0\u03bd3 )\u22122\u2212(s/2)\n\n(2.19)\n\n0\n\nand, using formulas easily derived from (B.16), we find\nh\n\u03b8k2\n) \u2212 \u03c8(\u2212 4s \u2212\n\u2212iN 23+s \u03932 (\u22121 \u2212 2s ) \u03c0i + \u03c8(\u2212 4s + k12\u03c0\n\u03b10 =\n\u03b8k4\n\u03b8k4\n\u03b8k2\n\u03c0\u0393(\u2212 4s + k32\u03c0\n)\u0393(\u2212 4s \u2212 k32\u03c0\n)\u0393(\u2212 4s + k12\u03c0\n)\u0393(\u2212 4s \u2212\n\ni\n\nk1 \u03b8k2\n2\u03c0 )\nk1 \u03b8k2\n2\u03c0 )\n\n,\n\n(2.20)\n\nwith \u03c8(z) = \u0393\u2032 (z)/\u0393(z).\nAs a first remark, we notice that, when \u03b8 goes to zero, this result smoothly tends to the\nexpression\nN \u03932 (\u2212 2+s\n4 )\n(2.21)\na0 =\ns\n2\n2\u03c0\u0393 (\u2212 4 )\nof eq.(2.14), which exhibits double poles at s = \u22122, 2, 6, * * *.\nAfter the symmetrization k1 \u2194 k2 , the terms containing the \u03c8-function cancel and we\nare left with\n\u03b10 (1, 2) + \u03b10 (2, 1) =\n\nN 24+s \u03932 (\u22121 \u2212 2s )\n\u0393(\u2212 4s +\n\nk3 \u03b8k4\ns\n2\u03c0 )\u0393(\u2212 4\n\n\u2212\n\nk3 \u03b8k4\ns\n2\u03c0 )\u0393(\u2212 4\n\n+\n\nk1 \u03b8k2\ns\n2\u03c0 )\u0393(\u2212 4\n\n\u2212\n\nk1 \u03b8k2\n2\u03c0 )\n\n.\n\n(2.22)\n\nNow the poles, which were missing when \u03b8 = 0, are switched on, the presence of the\nB-field providing extra structures. Indeed the gamma function in the numerator has poles\nat s = \u22122, 0, 2, 4, * * *, namely at all the open masses. There is no cancellation from the\ndenominator but for quite specific values of the external momenta such that k1 \u03b8k2 or k3 \u03b8k4\nis zero.\n2\n\nThis could also be interpreted as an indication of the need to sum over all possible configurations in dealing\nwith amplitudes in the presence of the B-background.\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\f1\n\n4\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFigure 2: Field-theoretical representation of the amplitude A(1, 2, 3, 4)\n\nThese open string poles deserve some comments. As is well known, the form of the ChanPaton factors of the non-planar amplitude (2.11) of fig.1 indicates that intermediate s-channel\nstates are \"colour\"-singlets. In fig.2 we have drawn a field-theory like diagram representing\nthe amplitude A(1, 2, 3, 4). If we single out the first contribution from the closed poles, namely\nthe closed-tachyon exchange with residue \u03b10 , we can represent it by a thick line. In addition,\ndouble poles arise from integration of the sin-functions, which produce singularities when\nthe variables \u03bd12 and \u03bd3 approach the values zero or one, the corresponding vertex insertions\npinching as in fig.2. An open string tower travels along the two thin lines, but only singlet\nstates can couple to the closed sector.\nWithout the B-field only a few groups are allowed, according to tree level unitarity:\nSO(n) and U Sp(n) for non-orientable open strings, U (n) for orientable ones. In the nonorientable case, levels s = \u22122, 2, * * * (open tachyon, open massive graviton, ...) contain singlets, while levels s = 0, 4, * * * (open vector, ...) do not. The pattern of double poles of (2.21)\nis thereby explained.\nIn the orientable case the level s = 0 contains a singlet, which is the U (1) component in\nthe splitting U (n) = SU (n) \u00d7 U (1) and could couple in principle to the closed channel. Its\nabsence in a0 is explained if one realizes that the tree level vertex for the production of a\nU (1) photon from two tachyons vanishes for symmetry reasons (see subsection 2.1).\nWhen the B-field is present, we find a different situation: first of all, the allowed gauge\ngroup undergoes a restriction [7], and we should consider only U (n). This is in agreement\nwith the pattern of poles of (2.22), where the double open pole at s = 0 is now present. As a\nmatter of fact the B-field does not alter the nature of the open string spectrum either: Since\nin the case of a gauge group SO(n) or U Sp(n) the mass-level s = 0 does not contain a singlet\ncomponent, this would be inconsistent with our findings. But groups SO(n) and U Sp(n) are\nindeed forbidden.\nFor U (n), the U (1) part of the vector still contributes in the closed channel and we find\nthe double open string pole at s = 0 in (2.22). This is due to a \"non-decoupling\" of the\nU (1) part of U (n), already encountered in the presence of the B-field for example in the\nvector amplitudes [17]. The simple reason for this phenomenon is that the above mentioned\ntree-level vertex for the production of a U (1) photon from two tachyons is now proportional\nto Tr [\u03bb1 \u03bb2 ](p1 \u2212 p2 )\u03bc exp[\u2212ip1 \u03b8p2 ], which does not vanish after symmetrization (see again\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fsubsection 2.1). The U (1) photon can therefore be produced as a singlet and couples to the\nclosed channel.\nIn analogy with the factorization found in subsection 2.1, we can now consider the expression (2.22) and single out the residue at the double pole s = 0. Exploiting the properties\nof the Gamma functions, we get:\n16 N\n1\n\u03b10 (1, 2) + \u03b10 (2, 1) \u2243 Tr [\u03bb1 \u03bb2 ] Tr [\u03bb3 \u03bb4 ] 4 2\n\u03c0 s (\u22122 \u2212 sCL /4)\nk3 \u03b8k4\nk1 \u03b8k2\n] sin[\n]\n(2.23)\n\u00d7(k1 \u03b8k2 )(k3 \u03b8k4 ) sin[\n2\n2\nwhere we have for clarity re-inserted the closed tachyon pole and the Chan-Paton factors.\nThis part of the amplitude is completely factorisable in the following form:\nN1 Tr [\u03bb1 \u03bb2 ] sin[\n\nGij\nGlm\nk3 \u03b8k4\nk1 \u03b8k2\n] (k1 \u2212 k2 )i\nDjl (K)\n(k3 \u2212 k4 )m sin[\n] Tr [\u03bb3 \u03bb4 ] N1 ,\n2\ns\ns\n2\n(2.24)\n\nwhere\n\n1\n\u03b8jmK m ;\n(2.25)\n(\u22122 \u2212 sCL /4)\nantisymmetry of \u03b8 and total momentum conservation (K = k1 + k2 = \u2212k3 \u2212 k4 ) have been\ntaken into account.\nThe factorization above can be easily traced back from fig.2.

(3.4)\n\nWe follow the same notations of the previous sections. Moreover, d = p + 1 is the dimension\n~ is their spacelike separation as in [21, 20]. The\nof the worldvolume of the branes, and Y\nexternal momenta all lie on the branes, which are infinitely heavy objects in perturbation\ntheory, breaking translational invariance in the transverse space. We notice the absence of\nthe function f (q 2 ) when comparing the integrand with the corresponding one in the bosonic\ncase, due to a cancellation between bosonic and fermionic sectors.\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fThe new factor log[q](d/2)\u22125 appears instead, which is absent in the critical dimension\nd = 10; a novelty is the term which accounts for the brane separation, which again would be\nabsent for space-filling D9-branes.\nHowever D9-branes are not possible here, for two reasons: The first one has to do with\nthe fact that a D9-brane theory is the same as a type I string theory, which is endowed with\nthe SO(32) gauge group. We have already remarked that such a group is incompatible with\nthe presence of the B-field [27]. The second one is that a D9-brane (type I open string) has\nno NS-NS B-field in its closed sector, it has a R-R two form which does not couple to the\nfundamental superstring according to the simple expression (3.1).\nA Dp-brane on an orientifold of type II has instead U (1) as natural gauge group (or\nU (n), if we have a stack of n overlapping branes). Such a group is allowed in the presence of\nthe B-field: We have indeed a B-field from the closed sector of an orientifold of type II.\n~|\nFor the sake of generality we consider n1 coincident branes, separated by a distance |Y\nfrom a stack of other n2 coincident branes of the same dimension p + 1. Let the gauge algebra\nof \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 be u(n1 ) and the one of \u03bb3 , \u03bb4 u(n2 ).\nK represents the tensorial structure of the amplitude: it originates from the trace over the\nfermionic part of the gauge boson vertex operator, saturated with the relevant polarization\nvectors [21]. One finds\n1\nml\nji\nn\n+ 2 permutations,\nK = M1 ji M2 lj M3 m\nl M4 m \u2212 M1ij M2 M3lm M4\n4\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere Mr ij = er i kr j \u2212 er j kr i , er being the polarization vectors; indices are raised and lowered\nwith the open string metric.\nThe integrand has almost the same form of the bosonic case, apart from the different\nq-structure and the already mentioned changes. We can again write\nAS (1, 2) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n~ |) \u03b1S (s, t, u, k1 \u03b8k2 , k3 \u03b8k4 ),\nfn (sCL , d, |Y\nn\n\n(3.6)\n\nn=0\n\nwith\n~ |) =\nfn (sCL , d, |Y\n\nZ\n\n1\n0\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n~ 2 / log[q] .\ndq q \u22121+n\u2212(sCL /4) (log[q])(d/2)\u22125 exp Y\n\n(3.7)\n\nThe expression of \u03b1S1 is essentially the same as the bosonic one eq.(2.18), with NS replacing\nN , the extra tensorial factor K and the shifts (s, t, u) \u2192 (s \u2212 4, t \u2212 4, u \u2212 4). In particular, it is\nagain odd under the exchange of k1 \u2194 k2 and therefrom vanishing when suitably symmetrized.\nAccording to Appendix B only even terms survive\nAS (1, 2) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n~ |) \u03b1S2n (s, t, u, k1 \u03b8k2 , k3 \u03b8k4 ).\nf2n (sCL , d, |Y\n\n(3.8)\n\nn=0\n\nLet us give a closer look at the coefficients f2n .

Then consistency requires\nfor a spatial distance |Y\nM 2 = 8n, which is precisely the closed string spectrum. We stress once again that we need\nto suitably symmetrize the amplitude in order to recover the correct pattern of closed string\npoles.\nThe factorization in eq.(3.6) deserves a comment. The residues on the closed string\npoles possess a tensorial structure on their own, which depends on the level n we consider.\nWhen coupled to the branes, only the vector components along the branes survive and do\nnot undergo the integration in (3.10). Their contribution is included in \u03b1Sn .\nNow we turn our attention to the contribution related to the massless closed pole, \u03b1S0 :\nAfter symmetrization we obtain the same result as in eq.(2.22), with s \u2192 s \u2212 4 and the factors\nNS and K\n\u03b1S0 (1, 2) + \u03b1S0 (2, 1) =\n\nNS K 2s \u03932 (1 \u2212 2s )\n\u0393(1 \u2212\n\ns\n4\n\n+\n\nk3 \u03b8k4\n2\u03c0 )\u0393(1\n\n\u2212\n\ns\n4\n\n\u2212\n\nk3 \u03b8k4\n2\u03c0 )\u0393(1\n\n\u2212\n\ns\n4\n\n+\n\nk1 \u03b8k2\n2\u03c0 )\u0393(1\n\n\u2212\n\ns\n4\n\n\u2212\n\nk1 \u03b8k2\n2\u03c0 )\n\n.\n\n(3.11)\n\nWhen \u03b8 vanishes, this expression becomes\naS0 (1, 2) + aS0 (2, 1) =\n\nNS K \u03932 ( 2\u2212s\n4 )\n.\n2\n\u03c0\u0393 (1 \u2212 4s )\n\n(3.12)\n\nThere are poles at s = 2, 6, * * *, again in the correct traditional pattern.\nWhen B is turned on, all the poles in the numerator of eq.(3.11), namely at s = 2, 4, 6, 8, ..\nare present, the ones at s = 4, 8, ... being no longer canceled by the denominator, apart from\nexceptional configurations of the momenta.\nWe notice a difference with the bosonic case: the open string pole at s = 0 is always\nabsent. Without the B-field, this massless pole is forbidden by supersymmetry (the vanishing\nof the one loop three-vectors amplitude due to a non-renormalization of the three-vector\nvertex). The presence of B does preserve this constraint: In particular, any vector amplitude\non the annulus with less than eight spinors, such as the three point amplitude, continues to\nbe zero [21].\n3.2 String singularities and unitarity in the Seiberg-Witten limit\nWe restore in the amplitude (3.4) the dependence on \u03b1\u2032 and introduce the notation K \u25e6 K \u2261\n\u2212K\u03b8G\u03b8K.

We\nchoose \u03b8 block-diagonal and distinguish between the \"magnetic\" case, where K \u25e6 K is positive\ndefinite (\u03b8 has only spatial components), and the \"electric\" case where, for simplicity, \u03b8 is\nchosen with the only non-vanishing component \u03b8E = \u03b801 .\nWe are now interested in exploring the analytic behaviour of the amplitude (2.12) as\na function of the variable s at suitable fixed values of the other kinematic variables. This\nbehaviour will be eventually compared with the one of the corresponding amplitude in the\nnoncommutative field theory obtained by performing the Seiberg-Witten limit.\nTo this purpose we express the variable sCL in term of s\nsCL = s \u2212\n\n1\nK \u25e6 K.\n4\u03c0 2 \u03b1\u20322\n\n(3.13)\n\nThe amplitude has a rich pattern of singularities, due to the fact that it describes simultaneously several physical processes in different kinematic regions. Besides the double poles\nat s = 2n, n = 1, 2, ... we have already mentioned, it exhibits a branch point at s = 4m2 with\na cut along the positive real axis. It is the unitarity cut related to the open strings attached\nto the branes.

It is well known that open strings in presence of an antisymmetric constant background\nare effectively described at low energy by noncommutative field theories.

They\nare indeed absent in eq.(3.21). The right-hand cut for s \u2265 4m2 , which is present (with a\ndifferent discontinuity ) also in commutative field theories due to intermediate on shell states,\nobviously survives.\nA different fate occurs to the branch points related to the closed string singularities. In\nthe magnetic case, if we look at the eq.(3.16), we see that in the limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0, they decouple\nas well.\nIf instead \u03b8 is of \"electric\" type, the Seiberg-Witten limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0, \u03b8E fixed, forces \u1ebc \u2192\n\u221e > 1. Even before reaching the noncommutative field theory limit, the string is pushed\ninto its region of instability owing to the flipping of the branch point (see eq.(3.19)). In\nthe meanwhile the closed branch points sn get closer and closer to \u2212KT2 (see eq.(3.18)). No\nwonder then that the amplitude in the resulting noncommutative theory eventually exhibits\nun unphysical cut of tachyonic type for s < \u2212KT2 .\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\f4. Concluding remarks\nThe main purpose of this work was to explore up to one loop the perturbative spectra and\nthe related factorization properties of (super)string amplitudes in the presence of a constant\nbackground field B. The final goal was to match peculiar (and sometimes pathological)\nfeatures of noncommutative field theories, derived by means of the Seiberg-Witten limit, with\nthe corresponding characteristics of the parent theory. This analysis was first performed in a\nsimpler bosonic string context, in spite of the well-known difficulties due to the presence of\ntachyons and to the large number of extra dimensions.\nClosed and open string poles occurring in the four open-string scattering amplitude were\nanalyzed. After the required symmetrization, the closed string spectrum turns out to be\nunaffected by the presence of B, as expected from unitarity. Extra open string poles are\ninstead present when B is switched on, this field providing further possible structures and\ntherefrom a partial symmetry loss. Remarkable factorization properties occurring in the\nresidues on the poles were found in full agreement with expected patterns.\nThis analysis was then extended to the more satisfactory superstring context. Here two\n~ were considered in order\nstacks of N (lower dimensional) branes at a relative distance Y\nto deal with the Chan-Paton group U (N ). This distance (divided by the string slope \u03b1\u2032 )\nprovides us with a mass scale, which can be interpreted as an IR or an UV effect, according\nto the different interpretations of fig.3 [20].\nWhen the background field is of an \"electric\" type, there is a critical value of the electric\nfield beyond which the string undergoes a classical perturbative instability and starts developing tachyonic poles. In the Seiberg-Witten limit this \"electric\" string is necessarily pushed\ninto its instability region; the resulting noncommutative field theory turns out to exhibit an\nunphysical cut whose presence was noticed since a long time [2, 4].\nA future step would be to explore this phenomenon in the more ambitious context of\nstring field theories; this might allow to go beyond on-shell amplitudes and perhaps also\nbeyond perturbation theory in the search of new, more satisfactory ground states.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank G.
