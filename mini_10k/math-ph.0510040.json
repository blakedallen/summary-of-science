WILLS\nDedicated to the memory of John Lewis - an inspirational academic great-grandfather.\nAbstract. The stochastic generators of Markov-regular operator cocycles on\nsymmetric Fock space are studied in a variety of cases: positive cocycles, projection cocycles, and partially isometric cocycles. Moreover a class of transformations of positive contraction cocycles is exhibited which leads to a polar\ndecomposition result.\n\n0. Introduction\nLet H be a Hilbert space and \u03c3 = (\u03c3t )t>0 be a semigroup of unital endomorphisms\nof the algebra B(H) - an E0 -semigroup ([Arv03]). A family of operators X =\n(Xt )t>0 \u2282 B(H) is a left cocycle (respectively a right cocycle) for \u03c3 if it satisfies\nX0 = I and Xr+t = Xr \u03c3r (Xt ) (resp. Xr+t = \u03c3r (Xt )Xr )\n\n(0.1)\n\nfor all r, t > 0. Unitary cocycles (i.e. each Xt is unitary) play a fundamental role\nin the classification of E0 -semigroups, which is carried out up to conjugation by\nsuch objects. The E0 -semigroups of type I (those that possess a sufficiently large\nnumber of cocycles) turn out to be precisely those that are cocycle conjugate to the\nCCR flow on symmetric Fock space, the particular flow being uniquely specified\nby a choice of Hilbert space k, called the noise dimension space in the language of\nquantum stochastic calculus (QSC). In QSC cocycles arise naturally as solutions of\na quantum stochastic differential equation (QSDE) of Hudson-Parthasarathy type,\nand it is standard practice to ampliate the CCR flow so that it acts on B(h \u2297 F+ ),\nwhere h is another Hilbert space (the initial space) and F+ denotes the symmetric\nFock space over L2 (R+ ; k). The coefficient driving the QSDE is some operator\nF \u2208 B(h \u2297 b\nk), where b\nk := C \u2295 k, and (conjugation by) the resulting cocycle can be\nviewed as a Feynman-Kac perturbation of the free evolution given by \u03c3 ([Acc78]).\nConversely, any contraction cocycle that is Markov-regular necessarily satisfies such\na QSDE for some such F , and moreover the collection of those F that are generators\nof contraction cocycles is now well-known, as are the subsets corresponding to the\ngenerators of isometric, coisometric and unitary cocycles. For more details see\n[Fag93, LP98, LW00a, LW00b], or the lecture notes [Lin05].\nIn this paper we characterise the generators of many other classes of cocycle,\nnamely self-adjoint cocycles, positive cocycles, projection cocycles and partially\nisometric cocycles, going beyond the case of contractive cocycles for the first two\nclasses. Positive contraction cocycles have appeared in the work of Bhat ([Bha01]),\nwhere they are used to study dilations and compressions between E-semigroups and\nquantum Markov semigroups on B(H). In the third section of the paper we discuss\na one-parameter family of transformations on the class of positive contraction cocycles, and describe the corresponding transformation on the stochastic generators\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

WILLS\n\nin the Markov-regular case. This leads naturally to a polar decomposition result\nin the final section, where it is shown that any Markov-regular contraction cocycle\nwith commutative component von Neumann algebra can be written as a product\nof a partial isometry cocycle and a positive cocycle.\nNotational conventions. Algebraic tensor products are denoted by \u2297, with \u2297\nreserved for the (completed) tensor product of Hilbert spaces and the tensor product\nof von Neumann algebras. The tensor symbol between Hilbert space vectors in\nelementary tensors will usually be suppressed. Given Hilbert spaces H and h, and\nx \u2208 h, we define maps Ex \u2208 B(H; H \u2297 h) and E x \u2208 B(H \u2297 h; H) by\nEx = u \u2297 x = ux\n\nand\n\nE x = (Ex )\u2217 ,\n\nwith context indicating the choice of H and h.\n1. Operator cocycles on Fock space\nFix two Hilbert spaces, the initial space h and the noise dimension space k. Let\nF+ denote the symmetric Fock space over L2 (R+ ; k), and in general let FI denote\nthe symmetric Fock space over L2 (I; k) for I \u2282 R. We shall make frequent use of\nthe time shift and time reversal operators on h \u2297 F+ , St and Rt respectively, which\nare the ampliated second quantisations of\n(\n(\n0\nif u < t,\nf (t \u2212 u) if u 6 t,\n(st f )(u) =\nand (rt f )(u) =\nf (u \u2212 t) if u > t,\nf (u)\nif u > t,\nso that St u\u03b5(f ) = u\u03b5(st f ), where \u03b5(f ) = (1, f, (2!)\u22121/2 f \u2297 f, . . .) is the exponential vector associated to f \u2208 L2 (R+ ; k). Note that the St are isometries and\nthe Rt are self-adjoint unitaries, with both maps t 7\u2192 St and t 7\u2192 Rt continuous\nin the strong operator topology, that is, strongly continuous. The endomorphism\nsemigroup (\u03c3t )t>0 on B(h \u2297 F+ ) is constructed from (St )t>0 by using the obvious\nisomorphism these maps induce between F+ and F[t,\u221e[ . More concretely, for any\nX \u2208 B(h \u2297 F+ ) the operator \u03c3t (X) is determined by\nZ t\n\u2217\n\u2217\nhu\u03b5(f ), \u03c3t (X)v\u03b5(g)i = hu\u03b5(st f ), Xv\u03b5(st g)i exp\nhf (u), g(u)i du.\n(1.1)\n0\n\nThe time reversal operators on B(h \u2297 F+ ) are\n\n\u03c1t (X) = Rt XRt .\n\n(1.2)\n\nA Fock-adapted left (respectively right) cocycle on h \u2297 F+ is any family X =\n(Xt )t>0 \u2282 B(h \u2297 F+ ) that satisfies the functional equation (0.1) together with the\nadaptedness condition\n(1.3)\nXt \u2208 B(h \u2297 F[0,t[ ) \u2297 IF[t,\u221e[ ,\n\u223c\nwhere we utilise the continuous tensor product factorisation of Fock space: F+ =\nF[0,t[ \u2297 F[t,\u221e[ via \u03b5(f ) \u2190\u2192 \u03b5(f |[0,t[ ) \u2297 \u03b5(f |[t,\u221e[ ). All cocycles in this paper will be\nassumed to satisfy (1.3).\nContinuity was not given as part of the definition; the next result mirrors/relies\non the corresponding result in semigroup theory.\nProposition 1.1. Let X = (Xt )t>0 be a left cocycle on h \u2297 F+ . If Xt \u2192 I weakly\nas t \u2192 0 then there are constants M, a \u2208 R such that\nkXt k 6 M eat\n\nfor all t > 0.\n\nMoreover, the map t 7\u2192 Xt is strongly continuous.\nCocycles satisfying these continuity conditions will be called C0 -cocycles.\n\n(1.4)\n\n\fGENERATORS OF OPERATOR COCYCLES\n\n3\n\nProof. Weak convergence to I implies, via two applications of the Banach-Steinhaus\nTheorem, that t 7\u2192 kXt k is bounded in a neighbourhood of 0. The existence of M\nand a then follows by a standard argument (see, for example, Proposition 1.18\nof [Dav80]) since kXr+t k 6 kXr kkXt k, because each \u03c3t is contractive.\nWeak continuity at 0, and the local uniform bound for X from (1.4) imply that\nXt \u2297 I\u2212 \u2192 Ih\u2297FR weakly, where I\u2212 is the identity on F\u2212 := F]\u2212\u221e,0[ , and we use\nFR \u223c\n= F+ \u2297 F\u2212 . If (S t )t>0 denotes the strongly continuous family of unitary right\nshifts on h \u2297 FR defined analogously to the isometries St , then Yt := (Xt \u2297 I\u2212 )S t\nis weakly convergent to Ih\u2297FR . Moreover, for any Z \u2208 B(h \u2297 F+ )\n\u2217\n\n\u03c3t (Z) \u2297 I\u2212 = S t (Z \u2297 I\u2212 )S t ,\n\nand it readily follows that (Yt )t>0 is a semigroup on h \u2297 FR . Hence it is strongly\n\u2217\ncontinuous, by Proposition 1.23 of [Dav80], thus so is t 7\u2192 Xt \u2297 I\u2212 = Yt S t , and the\nresult follows.\n\u0003\nRemarks. (i) A result in the same spirit is Proposition 2.5 of [Arv89] (reappearing\nas Proposition 2.3.1 of [Arv03]). It is more general on the one hand since it only\nassumes measurability of the cocycle, which is defined with respect to a general\nE0 -semigroup on a von Neumann algebra. However there are separability assumptions, and essential use is made of the more restrictive hypothesis that the cocycle\nbe isometric. Similarly, assumed contractivity of the cocycle is a necessary ingredient of the alternative proof of the above result for Fock-adapted cocycles given in\nLemma 1.2 of [LW05a].\n(ii) The result extends immediately to right cocycles by use of the time-reversal\noperators \u03c1t - see Lemma 1.3 below.\nLet S = Lin{d1[0,t[ : d \u2208 k, t > 0}, the subspace of L2 (R+ ; k) consisting of right\ncontinuous, piecewise constant functions. It is a dense subspace, so E := Lin{\u03b5(f ) :\nf \u2208 S} is dense in F+ . Consequently bounded operators on h \u2297 F+ are determined\nby their inner products against vectors of the form u\u03b5(f ) for u \u2208 h, f \u2208 S.\nThe next result (essentially Proposition 6.2 of [LW00b]) follows immediately from\nadaptedness and (1.1).\nTheorem 1.2. Let X be a bounded adapted process. The following are equivalent :\n(i) X is a left cocycle.\n\u03b5(c1[0,t[ )\n(ii) For each pair c, d \u2208 k, (Qc,d\nXt E\u03b5(d1[0,t[ ) )t>0 is a semigroup on\nt := E\nh, and for all f, g \u2208 S\nf (t ),g(t0 )\n\n0\nE \u03b5(f 1[0,t[ ) Xt E\u03b5(g1[0,t[ ) = Qt1 \u2212t\n0\n\nf (t ),g(tn )\n\n* * * Qt\u2212tnn\n\n(1.5)\n\nwhere {0 = t0 6 t1 6 * * * 6 tn 6 t} contains the discontinuities of f 1[0,t[\nand g1[0,t[ .\nIf in (i) we replace left by right then (1.5) in (ii) must be replaced by\nf (t ),g(tn )\n\nE \u03b5(f 1[0,t[ ) Xt E\u03b5(g1[0,t[ ) = Qt\u2212tnn\n\nf (t ),g(t0 )\n\n0\n* * * Qt1 \u2212t\n0\n\n.\n\n(1.5)\u2032\n\nThe collection of semigroups {Qc,d : c, d \u2208 k} is the family of associated semigroups of the cocycle X. Since the map (c, d) 7\u2192 Qc,d\nt is jointly continuous, a cocycle\nX is determined by the operators Qc,d\nfor\nc\nand\nd\ntaken from a dense subset of k.\nt\nIn fact this observation can be further refined by using totality results such as those\ncontained in [PS98, Ske00, Lin05] to show that it is sufficient to take c and d from a\ntotal subset of k that contains 0. If X is a C0 -cocycle then it is clear that all of the\nassociated semigroups are strongly continuous, since the map x 7\u2192 Ex is isometric. Conversely if all (or, rather, sufficiently many) of the associated semigroups are\nstrongly continuous and if X is locally uniformly bounded, then from (1.5) it follows\n\n\f4\n\nSTEPHEN J. WILLS\n\nthat t 7\u2192 Xt is weakly continuous at 0, and hence X is a C0 -cocycle. The a priori\nassumption of local boundedness is needed here for this (perhaps naive) method of\nproof to get weak continuity on all of the complete space h \u2297 F+ , rather than just\nh\u2297E, then Proposition 1.1 can be invoked to obtain the improved bound (1.4).\nA stronger hypothesis on the map t 7\u2192 Xt is Markov-regularity, as considered\nin [LW00b], which insists on norm continuity of the Markov semigroup Q0,0 . For a\nC0 -cocycle (or, indeed, any locally uniformly bounded cocycle) this is equivalent to\nassuming that all of the associated semigroups are norm continuous, which follows\neasily from the estimate k\u03b5(a1[0,t[ ) \u2212 \u03b5(c1[0,t[ )k = O(t1/2 ).\nIn many cases, for instance when proving Theorem 2.1, it can be useful to pass\nfrom left to right cocycles or vice versa. Two methods for doing this are taking\ne by\nadjoints and time-reversal, where for any process X we define X\nwith \u03c1t is defined in (1.2).\n\net := \u03c1t (Xt )\nX\n\nLemma 1.3.

Equivalence of (i) and (ii) is immediate since \u03c3t is \u2217 -homomorphic. Equivalence of (i) and (iii) follows from Theorem 1.2 and the fact that Rt \u03b5(c1[0,t[ ) =\ne share the same family of associated semigroups.\n\u03b5(c1[0,t[ ), so that X and X\n\u0003\nGiven a cocycle X we define two unital subalgebras of B(h):\n\nAX = the norm-closed algebra generated by {Qc,d\nt : c, d \u2208 k, t > 0},\n\n(1.6)\n\nand\nMX = the von Neumann algebra generated by AX .\n\n(1.7)\n\nThese algebras enter into characterisations of various properties of X.

Commutativity of AX does not imply commutativity of MX .

Other remarks on the differences between parts (a), (b)\nand (c) of the proposition are best made with reference to the stochastic generator\nof the cocycle, the subject of the next section, and so are postponed until then.\n2.

However the solutions\nhave domain h\u2297E and satisfy a property called weak regularity, a property shared\nby any locally bounded process. Moreover X F and FX are the unique weakly\nregular (weak) solutions to (L) and (R) for the given F . On the other hand, any\nweakly regular process X satisfies (L) (or (R)) (weakly) for at most one F . See\nTheorems 3.1 and 7.13 of [LW00a]. It follows that (X F )\u2217 is the unique weakly\n\u2217\nregular solution of (R) for F \u2217 , i.e. (X F )\u2217 |h\u2297E = F X.\nThe solution X F enjoys a semigroup decompositions of the form (1.5), where\nnow\ntZdc\nQc,d\nfor Zdc = E bc (F + \u2206)Edb = E bc F Edb + hc, di.\n(2.2)\nt =e\nThe solution FX of (R) has a similar description involving the same semigroups,\nbut with the product as in (1.5)\u2032 .

More imporX solves (L) if and only if the time-reversed process X\ntantly, if the solution to (L) (respectively to (R)) is a bounded process then it is\na Markov-regular left (resp. right) cocycle. However it is still an open problem to\ndetermine all the operators F that yield bounded solutions. For contractive, isometric, coisometric, and hence unitary solutions the situation is understood much\nbetter, with the answer being given in terms of the map \u03c7 on B(h \u2297 b\nk) where\n\u03c7(F ) := F + F \u2217 + F \u2217 \u2206F.\n\n(2.3)\n\nTheorem 2.1 ([Fag93, LW00a]).

For infinite-dimensional\nk, a priori the matrix [F\u03b2\u03b1 ] only gives us a form on h \u2297 b\nk, with respect to which X\nsatisfies a weak form of (L) or (R) - this is Theorem 6.6 of [LW00b]. However, if\nthe cocycle is in addition contractive then the form is bounded, and so the F\u03b2\u03b1 are\nthe components of some F \u2208 B(h \u2297 b\nk) as before.\nRecall the subalgebras AX and MX of B(h) associated to a cocycle X by (1.6)\nand (1.7). For a generated cocycle X, i.e. one satisfying (L) or (R) for some F \u2208\nB(h \u2297 b\nk), it follows from (2.2) and (2.5) that AX is the unital algebra generated by\nthe components F\u03b2\u03b1 of F .

In terms of the operators in (iii) one may recognise Bhat's characterisation of positive contraction cocycles in the special case when h = C ([Bha01, Theorem 7.5]).

Thus in this setting X F is partial isometry-valued if and only if\nDn is a partial isometry for each n, whereas \u03c0(F ) = 0 merely if D alone is a partial\nisometry.

A transformation of positive cocycles\n\nProposition 3.1. Let X = (Xt )t>0 be a left cocycle with Xt > 0 for each t > 0.\nThen for each real number \u03b1 > 0 the family X \u03b1 = (Xt\u03b1 )t>0 is a left cocycle.\nProof. We are dealing with a self-adjoint cocycle, so it is both a left and a right\ncocycle, hence\nXr+t = Xr \u03c3r (Xt ) = \u03c3r (Xt )Xr\n\nfor all r, t > 0.\n\nn\n\n(3.1)\n\nFrom this it is clear that X is a cocycle for any integer n > 1, and one consisting\nof positive operators.\n1/2\nSince \u03c3r is a \u2217 -homomorphism it follows that \u03c3r (Xt ) > 0 and that \u03c3r (Xt ) =\n1/2\n\u03c3r (Xt ) . Moreover from (3.1) and the continuous functional calculus we obtain\n1/2\n\n[Xr1/2 , \u03c3r (Xt )1/2 ] = [Xr1/2 , \u03c3r (Xt\n\n)] = 0,\n\n\fGENERATORS OF OPERATOR COCYCLES\n\nand thus\n\n1/2\n\nXr1/2 \u03c3r (Xt\n\n) > 0,\n\n1/2\n\nXr1/2 \u03c3r (Xt\n\n11\n\n\u00012\n) = Xr+t .\n\nHence, by uniqueness of positive square roots, X 1/2 is a left and right cocycle of\npositive operators.\nThese two observations show that X \u03b1 is a cocycle for any dyadic rational \u03b1.\nTo get the desired result for any \u03b1 > 0 let (\u03b1n )n>1 be a decreasing sequence of\ndyadic rationals with \u03b1n \u2192 \u03b1. Now if h\u03b2 (t) := t\u03b2 for \u03b2 > 0 then h\u03b1n \u2192 h\u03b1 locally\nuniformly - the function sequence is pointwise increasing on [0, 1] and pointwise\ndecreasing on [1, T ] for any T > 1, and so Dini's Theorem may be applied. Thus\nappealing to the continuous functional calculus once more and continuity of \u03c3r is\n\u03b1\nenough to show that Xr+t\n= Xr\u03b1 \u03c3r (Xt\u03b1 ) as required.\n\u0003\nIt should be noted that the proof of the above result does not on particular\nproperties of the CCR flow \u03c3 on Fock space. Indeed, the result is valid for any\nE-semigroup since even preservation of the identity by \u03c3 is not used.\nHowever, if the cocycle X is a Markov-regular positive contraction cocycle then\nit has a stochastic generator F .

Thus F\u03b1 satisfies condition (iii) of Corollary 2.4,\nshowing that it is the generator of a positive contraction cocycle.\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.3. Let X be a Markov-regular positive contraction cocycle with stochastic generator F . Then for each real \u03b1 > 0 the cocycle X \u03b1 is Markov-regular\nwith generator F\u03b1 given by (3.3).\nProof. The identities (3.2b) lead immediately to\nF\u03b1 + F\u03b2 + F\u03b1 \u2206F\u03b2 = F\u03b1+\u03b2\n\nfor all \u03b1, \u03b2 > 0.\n\n(3.4)\n\nIn particular, noting that F1 = F , it follows from Lemma 2.5 and an induction\nargument that X n is Markov-regular and has generator Fn for each n \u2208 N.\nNext, Lemma 3.2 shows that F 21 is the generator of some positive contraction\ncocycle Y . By (3.4) and Lemma 2.5, Y 2 is also a cocycle with generator 2F 21 +\nF 21 \u2206F 21 = F1 = F , and so Y 2 = X by uniqueness of generators. Thus the cocycle\nX 1/2 has generator F 21 .\nNow the identities (3.2c) give (F\u03b1 )\u03b2 = F\u03b1\u03b2 for all \u03b1, \u03b2 > 0, so square roots may\nbe taken repeatedly, followed by taking arbitrarily large integer powers to show\nthat X \u03b1 is Markov-regular with generator F\u03b1 for each dyadic rational \u03b1 > 0.\nIf we choose any real number \u03b1 > 1 and let (\u03b1n )n>1 be a sequence of such\nrationals with \u03b1n \u2193 \u03b1, then the function sequences (f\u03b1n ), (g\u03b1n ) and (h\u03b1n ) converge\npointwise to f\u03b1 , g\u03b1 and h\u03b1 . The inequalities (3.2d) show that the convergence is\nalso monotonic, and hence uniform by Dini's Theorem, so that F\u03b1n \u2192 F\u03b1 in norm.\nIt follows from (1.5) and (2.2) that the associated semigroups of the cocycle X \u03b1 are\nthe norm limits of the semigroups associated to X \u03b1n , and thus X \u03b1 has stochastic\ngenerator F\u03b1 .\nFinally, for any remaining 0 < \u03b1 < 1 pick n \u2208 N so that \u03b2 := 2n \u03b1 > 1, then X \u03b2\n\u2212n\nhas generator F\u03b2 , and X \u03b1 = (X \u03b2 )2 has generator (F\u03b2 )2\u2212n = F\u03b1 .\n\u0003\n4.

Also,\nwe want U to be partial isometry-valued, so need to satisfy \u03c0(E) = 0 by Proposition 2.8.

Every Markov-regular contraction cocycle X for which MX is commutative can be written as the product of a partial isometry-valued cocycle and a\npositive contraction cocycle.\nExamples. (i) Take h = C, then AX = MX = C, thus Theorem 4.1 is applicable to\nany contraction cocycle on F+ , since also every cocycle is trivially Markov-regular\nin this context.

This follows from (4.1) (see also [Lin05, Theorem 5.12] or [GLSW03,\nTheorem 6.2]). It is then possible to write down the generators G and E of the\npositive part and partial isometry cocycles for any choice of partial isometry N\nsuch that N |D| = D.\nAs a particular case suppose that D is already a partial isometry, let P = |D|,\nthe projection onto the initial space of D, and take N = D. Then\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u03bd2\n\u0001\nh\u03bdP \u22a5 w|\n\u2212 2 1 + kP \u22a5 wk2\nand\nG=\n|\u03bdP \u22a5 wi\nP \u2212I\n\u0015\n\u0014\ni\u03bc \u2212 21 kvk2 \u2212 21 \u03bd 2 kP \u22a5 wk h\u03bdP \u22a5 w \u2212 D\u2217 v|\n.\nE=\n|vi\nD\u2212I\n\n\f14\n\nSTEPHEN J. WILLS\n\nThis applies for example if we take k = l2 (N) with usual orthonormal basis and\ntake D to be the coisometric left shift, so that P is the projection onto {e1 }\u22a5 . Note\nthat if we choose \u03bc = \u03bd = 0, and v = w = 0 then\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n0\n0\n0\n0\nF =E=\n, G=\n.\n0 D\u2212I\n0 P \u2212I\n\nIf \u0393(Z) denotes the second quantisation of Z \u2208 B(L2 (R+ ; k)) then using the isomorphism L2 (R+ ; k) \u223c\n= L2 (R+ ) \u2297 k it follows that\nXt = Ut = \u0393(M1[0,t[ \u2297 D + M1[t,\u221e[ \u2297 Ik ),\n\n|Xt | = \u0393(M1[0,t[ \u2297 P + M1[t,\u221e[ \u2297 Ik ),\n\n\u221e\n\nwhere Mf denotes multiplication by f \u2208 L (R+ ). In particular since D is not\nnormal, the algebra generated by the process X is not commutative.\nOn a different tack, note that equation (4.2c) only specifies L on Ran |D|, so\none might be tempted to set it equal to 0 on the orthogonal complement, which\nwould certainly be the case if we replace L by L\u2032 := LN \u2217 N . This has the effect of\napparently making it easier to check the third of the identities in (4.3) (noting that\nthe first and second remain valid), since L\u2032 (I \u2212 N \u2217 N )L\u2032\u2217 = 0. But for our example\nabove with D as the left shift one finds that K now becomes\nK = i\u03bc \u2212 21 kvk2 + 21 \u03bd 2 kP \u22a5 wk2\n\n\u21d2\n\nK + K \u2217 + M \u2217 M = \u03bd 2 kP \u22a5 wk2 .\n\nThus the third equation in (4.3) will fail for an appropriate choice of \u03bd and w, and\nhence U will not be partial isometry-valued.\n\u0002A B \u0003\n(ii) As a special case of the more general situation, suppose that F = C\nD\u2212I \u2208\nb\nN \u2297 B(k) for a commutative von Neumann algebra N , and with D isometric. Then\n|D| = I, N = D and hence\n\u0015\n\u00141\n\u0015\n\u00141\n(A + A\u2217 + C \u2217 C) 0\n(A \u2212 A\u2217 \u2212 C \u2217 C) \u2212C \u2217 D\nand E = 2\n.\nG= 2\n0\n0\nC\nD\u2212I\n\nIn particular the positive part is |Xt | = Pt \u2297 IF+ where Pt is the positive semigroup\non h with generator 21 (A + A\u2217 + C \u2217 C), and all of the stochastic terms occur only\nin the process U . Moreover in this case \u03c7(E) = 0, so U is an isometric cocycle.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS. I am indebted to Martin Lindsay for providing Proposition 2.9 and the example in the subsequent remark.
