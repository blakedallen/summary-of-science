Introduction\nIn gauge mediation of supersymmetry breaking (see e.g. [2-13]), a susy-breaking hidden sector is coupled to a supersymmetric extension of the standard model (SSM) only\nthrough gauge interactions. In direct gauge mediation, the SSM interacts with the hidden sector through the SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) gauge interactions of the standard model.\n\nAnother model-building option is indirect gauge mediation, where susy breaking is communicated from the hidden sector to an intermediate, messenger sector through some new\ngauge interactions, and then from the messenger sector to the MSSM via the SM gauge\ninteractions. In what follows, we'll consider general aspects of susy breaking mediation\nfrom a susy-breaking \"hidden sector\" to an otherwise supersymmetric \"visible sector,\" via\ngauge interactions1\nLint \u2283 g\n\nZ\n\nd4 \u03b8(Jhidden + Jvis )V,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere J are the currents in the two sectors and V is the gauge vector multiplet. We refer to\n\nthe sectors as \"hidden\" and \"visible,\" but our discussion will be completely general and will\nnot assume that the \"visible\" sector is actually the SSM. Thus our general analysis can also\nbe applied in models where the \"visible sector\" is instead replaced with an intermediate\nmessenger sector.\nWe will here consider general aspects of gauge mediation of susy breaking with gauge\nmessengers, i.e. when some of the gauge fields V in (1.1) themselves have a tree-level\nsusy-split spectrum. The majority of the literature on gauge mediation focuses on the case\n\nwithout gauge messengers, where the gauge multiplet spectrum is susy-split only at the\nloop-level. Indeed, even the general gauge mediation framework of [1] focuses on that case.\nSee also e.g. [16-23] for further work on non-gauge-messenger, general gauge mediation.\nAlthough gauge messengers are less studied, it is not such an exotic pheonomenon: gauge\nmessengers occur whenever charged hidden sector fields get non-zero F-components2 .\nGauge messengers have a long history. The Fayet-Iliopoulos model [24], has gauge\nmessengers (for FI term sufficiently large), taking the Higgsed U (1) gauge group of the\nmodel as a U (1)\u2032 to communicate susy breaking to the MSSM. Another classic with gauge\n1\n\nOne could also consider including direct superpotential coupling of the sectors, as is some-\n\ntimes useful in considering the Higgs sector (see e.g. [14], [15]), but we will not do so here.\n2\n\nGauge messengers can also occur with D-term breaking. As we will discuss later, D-term\n\nbreaking is already covered by our F-term based analysis whenever the gauge group is Higgsed:\nwhen m2V 6= 0, hDi is not an independent variable.\n\n1\n\n\fmessengers is Witten's inverted hierarchy model [4], where the charged fields breaking the\nGUT group also have non-zero, susy-breaking F-terms. This scenario was analyzed in\nmany following works long ago e.g. [7,25-30] and also more recently, e.g. in [31], where it\nwas noted that gauge messengers can help alleviate the little hierarchy problem and they\nprovide interesting, and somewhat unexplored, new avenues for model building.\nWith gauge messengers, the gauge group is Higgsed (at least partially) together with\nsupersymmetry being broken. Possible candidates for gauge messengers are (i) the massive vector bosons of a GUT gauge group; (ii) some new Higgsed gauge sector, such as\na U (1)\u2032 coupling to the MSSM; (iii) the W \u00b1 and Z 0 sector of the MSSM; (iv) a new\ngauge sector, coupling to a separate messenger sector, which is then coupled to the MSSM\n(this possibility includes Semi-direct Gauge Mediation [32]). We will here generalize the\nframework of [1] to include the possibility of gauge messengers, and the possibility that\nthe susy-mediating gauge group is (partially or fully) Higgsed. We considered aspects of\ngauge mediation by susy-preserving Higgsed gauge groups in [33,18], and here we generalize that to the case of susy-breaking Higgsed gauge groups. Because gauge messengers are\nrelatively unexplored, we will also note many basic properties which are not widely known\nand/or are incompletely treated in some of the literature, and resolve some puzzling issues.\nFor theories where the messengers' susy-splitting is small relative to their susy mass\ncomponent, e.g. if Fi \u223c hQ2 Xi i and Mi \u223c hXi i have |Fi | \u226a |Mi |2 , the leading visible sector\n\nsoft masses can be obtained by using the technique of analytic continuation in superspace\n[27,34,35]. This method works equally well whether or not there are gauge messengers.\n\nIndeed, this technique was first developed [27] to study gauge messenger models, and some\nkey differences between gauge-messenger and non-gauge-messenger models were discussed\nin [34]. Our general analysis will include the small-F -term results as a limiting case.\nWe will note and explain, however, some differences from the literature. For example,\nwe note that the vector multiplet coupling to the visible sector generally has StrMV2 6=\n\n0. Also, much of the literature has focused on the case where the same, single chiral\n\nsuperfield \u03a3 = M + \u03b8 2 F breaks both the gauge symmetry and supersymmetry. We note\nthat this is an oversimplification in actual models of spontaneous susy-breaking, such as\nthe O'Raifearteigh model. We note that in the more general case, gauge messengers also\nlead to non-vanishing one-loop contributions to the sfermion m2 s.\nGauge mediation without gauge messengers has some generic properties, e.g.\n1. Vanishing one-loop contributions to visible-sector sfermion soft-breaking masses.\n2\n\n\f2. Non-zero two-loop m2sf ermion , which are typically non-tachyonic at the messenger scale\n(aside from contributions from fields with D-type masses).\n3. Though one-loop gaugino masses mgaugino are generated, they vanish to leading order\nin F/M 2 if susy is spontaneously broken [28]. Non-zero one-loop gaugino masses are\ngenerated at order F 3 /M 5 , as seen e.g. in [36], but they tend to be small and so\nmgaugino tends to be anomalously small compared with msf ermion . See [37] for a\nrecent discussion and how this could be evaded by a certain type of metastability.\n4. Insignificant A terms. A terms vanish to one-loop at the messenger scale, and are only\ngenerated at lower scales with two-loop factors, from one-loop RG running induced\nby the (already small) one-loop gaugino masses.\nGauge messenger models, on the other hand, have qualitatively different properties:\n1\u2032 . Non-zero (generally tachyonic) one-loop3 contributions to soft masses m2sf ermion .\n2\u2032 . Tachyonic contributions to the two-loop sfermion m2sf ermion at the messenger scale.\n3\u2032 . Non-zero, one-loop gaugino masses, already at O(F/M ), included for the gauginos\nassociated with massless (unhiggsed) gauge field subgroups.\n\n4\u2032 . Significant A-terms, V \u2283 AQ Q\u2202Q W +h.c. with AQ generated at one-loop and non-zero\nat the messenger scale.\n\nThese observations have a long history. In the context of the inverse-hierarchy [4]\ntype models, a diagram leading to (1\u2032 ) one-loop m2sf ermion was mentioned in [7], but not\nexplicitly computed as it was observed to be insignificant in their model because of an\nadditional suppression by (msusy /MGUT )2 \u226a 1 as compared with the two-loop m2sf ermion .\n\nIn the context of analytic continuation in superspace [27,34], a proof was given that there\n\ncannot be one-loop contributions to m2sf ermion (as we will discuss, the loophole in the proof\nR\nPN\nis simply that d4 \u03b8 ln( i=1 X\u0304i Xi ) 6= 0 if N > 1). The tachyonic two-loop m2sf ermion\n\ncontributions (2\u2032 ) were discussed using analytic continuation in superspace in [34], and it\n\nwas noted that the net result is typically tachyonic. The fact (3\u2032 ) that gauge messengers\n3\n\nto\n\nThis should not be confused with the well-known (see e.g. [38,39]) one-loop contributions\n\nm2Q ,\n\nproportional to the hypercharge, coming from a one-loop induced hD A i =\n6 0. Messenger\n\nparity [38], a J A \u2192 \u2212J A symmetry to keep hD A i = 0, is introduced to eliminate those problematic\none-loop m2Q s. The one-loop m2Q s we're discussing have nothing to do with hD A i and can occur\nfor non-abeliang groups, regardless of whether or not messenger parity is imposed.\n\n3\n\n\fevade the issue of vanishing gaugino mass contribution was noted in [28], and an explicit\ncomputation of the non-zero, one-loop, O(F/M ) gaugino mass was given in [29] for a model\n\nwith gauge messengers. The fact (4\u2032 ) that there can be significant A terms with gauge\n\nmessengers was noted using analytic continuation in superspace [27,34].\nWe aim to clarify these issues, and to generalize them in a model-independent, currentalgebra based framework, much as in [1], which does not rely on a weakly coupled hidden\nsector. The gauginos and visible sector sfermions get susy-breaking soft masses from\ndiagrams similar to those of [1], see Fig. 1, except that here the blobs denote the full\npropagators (the sum of the series of 1PI propagators) of the vector-multiplet fields.\n\nD1\n\nD2\n\nD3\n\nD4\n\nD5\n\nFigure 1. Diagram D1 is the chirality-flipped propagator \u03a3(p2 ). Diagrams D2-D5 contribute to the\nmasses of sfermions and involve the spin 0, 1/2, and 1 gauge superfield propagators, \u2206(p2 ), \u2206\u03b1\u03b2 (p2 ),\nand \u2206\u03bc\u03bd (p2 ), respectively.\n\nConsider a general situation with gauge group G\u2032 in the UV4 , spontaneously broken\nto subgroup G \u2282 G\u2032 at some energy scale mV = mG\u2032 /G . We separate our discussion into\n\neffects associated with the propagators of massless gauge fields (denoted by A), and those\nassociated with the propagators of massive gauge fields (denoted by A\u2032 ). In the general\n\ncase where the gauge group is partially broken, with some gauge fields remaining massless,\n4\n\nWe use primes to denote UV extensions or versions of quantities.\n\n4\n\n\fboth effects are present, e.g. sfermions get masses from both the massless gauge fields and\nmassive gauge fields, as in Fig. 2.\n\nA\n\nA\u2032\n\nA\n\n(a)\n\nA, A\u2032\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2. The gauge fields in (a) are massless, while in (b), they are massive.\nFor example, with SU (5) \u2192 SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1), the first diagram (a) includes gauge\nmediation by the Standard Model gauge fields (including massive SU (5)/[SU (3)\u00d7SU (2)\u00d7\nU (1)] in the blob), while the second diagram (b) includes new effects from the additional\nmassive gauge fields of SU (5).\nThe unbroken gauge fields have supersymmetric tree-level spectrum. (Clearly, hF \u2020i i =\n\u2212K ij \u2202\u03c6j W only breaks those generators which are already broken by h\u03c6i i.) So the unbroken gauge fields in Fig. 2a yield a contribution to the sfermion soft-masses which is\ntwo-loop and similar to [1], except that the massive gauge fields contribute to the propagators of the unbroken gauge fields, and lead to the new effects (2\u2032 ) and (3\u2032 ) mentioned above.\nThe new effects (1\u2032 ) and (4\u2032 ) mentioned above comes from direct coupling of visible sector\nto the broken gauge fields, Fig. 2b, which can have susy-splittings already at tree-level.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. In sect. 2, we will provide a technical outline\nand summary of our results. Section 3 is devoted to a general discussion of gauge field\npropagators and current algebra, including discussion of spontaneous symmetry breaking,\nNG boson supermultiplets, and how the super-gauge field multiplet components get their\nmasses. In sect. 4, we discuss gauge mediation by any remaining massless gauge fields,\nas in Fig. 2a, and in particular the new qualitative effects from the contributions of the\nmassive gauge messenger fields to the correlators of the unbroken currents, as in Fig. 3.\nThese lead to the characteristic properties (2\u2032 ) and (3\u2032 ) of gauge messengers mentioned\nabove.\n5\n\n\fA\u2032\n\nA\n\nB\n\nB\u2032\n\nFigure 3. The external gauge fields are massless, and the internal ones are massive.\nIn sect. 5, we discuss the effects of coupling the massive gauge messenger gauge fields\ndirectly to the visible sector matter, as in Fig. 2b, and how this leads to the properties (1\u2032 )\nand (4\u2032 ) above. In sect. 6, the susy algebra structure of the soft terms, and the small susybreaking limit are considered. Section 7 is devoted to examples and, in sect. 8, we conclude.\nAppendix A summarizes some basic aspects of susy and notation, susy breaking, spurions,\nand analytic continuation in superspace. In appendix B we demonstrate the equivalence of\nthree methods of computing the effective potential, which generally have different regimes\nof validity, namely our current-correlator expression vs the Coleman-Weinberg potential\nvs the effective K\u00e4hler potential, where the methods are simultaneously valid.\nNote added: After this work was substantially completed, and it was presented at the\nSimons Summer Workshop [40], we learned of M. Buican and Z. Komargodski's independent work on a similar topic [41]; we thank them for bringing their work to our attention\nprior to its completion, and for communications and comments on our paper. There is\nalso a small amount of overlap (e.g. in parts of our sect. 3.1) with parts of the otherwise\ncomplementary recent work [42], and also with [43].\n\n2. A technical outline and summary of results\nIn this paper, we suppose that the the hidden, susy-breaking sector couples to the\nvisible sector via gauge interactions (1.1), and work in small g perturbation theory. The\nhidden sector can (fully or partially) break the gauge symmetry, in addition to supersymmetry. The broken gauge fields have mass mV , which we treat as order mV = O(g 0 ) in\nour perturbative expansion. Much as in [1], we do not need to know every detail of the\nhidden sector \u2013 the relevant information is how the hidden sector contributes to the current\ncorrelators.\n6\n\n\f2.1. Tree level contact interactions\nOne effect, which we mention for completeness but which will not be so important for\nthe considerations of this paper, is present already at tree-level, and regardless of any susy\nbreaking. Integrating out massive vector multiplets in (1.1) induces a well-known contact\ninteraction in the low-energy theory\nZ\nZ\nX\nX\n1\n1\n4\nA B\nA\nB\nd \u03b8J J \u2283 \u2212\nd4 \u03b8Jvis\nJhidden\n,\nLlow \u2283 \u2212\n2(m2V )AB\n(m2V )AB\n\n(2.1)\n\nAB\n\nAB\n\nwhich is a correction to the low-energy K\u00e4hler potential (see [21] for a recent discussion of\nits curvature). Here A and B are gauge adjoint indices (which we'll often suppress). This\nAB B\nJ , and illustrates that\ninteraction accounts for the coupling of J A to hV A i = \u2212(m\u22122\nV )\n\nthe visible sector notices the hidden sector just via its effect on the gauge fields.\n\nThe interaction (2.1) can yield tree-level gauge meditation to the visible sector, namely\nB\nvisible sector susy-breaking D-type soft sfermion masses, if hJhidden\ni|\u03b82 \u03b8\u03042 6= 0, i.e. if\n\nF0 T B F0 6= 0. In this case, as noted long ago [28], the EOM yield\nhDA i(m2V )AB = \u22122g\n\nX\nr\n\nhF\u0304r TrB Fr i \u2261 \u22122g F\u03040 T B F0 .\n\n(2.2)\n\nB\nCurrent conservation (gauge invariance) ensures that hJhidden\ni|\u03b82 = 0. The relation (2.2)\n\nimplies that hDi is not an independent susy-breaking variable when m2V 6= 0. So D-term\n\nbreaking is included in a general analysis of F -term breaking, except in the very limited\nclass of models (abelian gauge theories with added FI term) where hDi =\n6 0 and m2V = 0.\n\nIf the hidden sector is an O'Raifeartaigh-type model of F-term susy breaking, with\n\ngauge interactions included by taking the fields \u03a6 in reps of a gauge group G (as in\ne.g. [4-7,25-30,44-46] etc.) then we can take \u03c6\u03040 T B \u03c60 = 0, and then gauge invariance\nof the superpotential and the EOM (assuming canonical K\u00e4hler potential) imply that\nB\nF\u03040 T B F0 = 0 (see e.g. [30]). So in these cases hJhidden\ni|\u03b82 \u03b8\u03042 \u223c hDB i = 0 and there is no\n\ntree-level susy-breaking mediation to the visible sector. To have (2.2) non-zero, the hidden\nsector must break susy by a combination of D and F -terms (and/or have non-canonical\nK\u00e4hler potential) as in the SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) theory [8] discussed in [32]; see also [47].\n\nWe will here mostly focus on cases without tree-level gauge mediation, where (2.2)\n\nvanishes, and the leading susy-breaking gauge mediation to the light fields of the visible\nsector is via loops. We'll illustrate some aspects of the case where (2.2) is non-zero in the\nFI model [24] example, in section 7. See [42] for a recent, thorough discussion of tree-level\ngauge mediation.\n7\n\n\f2.2. Gauge field's full propagators are the fundamental quantities\nThe observable, susy-breaking effects in the gauge and visible sectors can be obtained\nfrom the propagators for the component fields of the gauge vector supermultiplet5\n2\n\u2206AB (p2 ) \u2261 ihDA (p)DB (\u2212p)i \u2261 \u2206AB\n0 (p ),\n2\nA\nB\n2\n2\n\u2206AB\n\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 (p ) \u2261 ih\u03bb\u03b1 (p)\u03bb\u0304\u03b1\u0307 (\u2212p)i \u2261 p\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 \u22061/2 (p )/p ,\n\n(2.3)\n\n2\nA\nB\n2\n2\n2\n\u2206AB\n\u03bc\u03bd (p ) \u2261 ihV\u03bc (p)V\u03bd (\u2212p)i \u2261 (\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 p\u03bc p\u03bd /p )\u22061 (p )/p .\n\nHere A, B are adjoint group indices. Unbroken susy would imply \u22060 = \u22061/2 = \u22061 =\n\u2206susy (p2 ), and \u2206 = 1 for a free, supersymmetric vector multiplet. The mass spectrum of\nany Higgsed gauge fields, in particular, shows up as poles in these propagators. Since the\nmasses of the Higgsed gauge field can have susy-breaking mass differences already at treelevel, O(g 0 ), so can the location of the poles of the propagators (2.3). The susy-breaking\n\neffects for the visible sector matter and gauginos will now be expressed in terms of the\nfollowing super-traced combination of the above propagators,\n2\n\u03bc\u03bd 2 AB 2\n\u039eAB (p2 ) \u2261 \u2206AB (p2 ) \u2212 2p\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 \u2206AB\n\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 (p ) + g p \u2206\u03bc\u03bd (p ),\n2\nAB 2\nAB 2\n= \u2206AB\n0 (p ) \u2212 4\u22061/2 (p ) + 3\u22061 (p ),\n\n(2.4)\n\ntogether with the chirality-flipped gaugino propagator,\n\u03a3AB (p2 ) =\n\ni \u03b1\u0307\u03b2\u0307 A\n\u01eb h\u03bb\u0304\u03b1\u0307 (p)\u03bb\u0304B\n(\u2212p)i,\n\u03b2\u0307\n2\n\n(2.5)\n\nboth of which would vanish if susy were unbroken, \u039esusy = \u03a3susy = 0. The propagator\n(2.5) would also vanish if there is an unbroken R-symmetry, as R(\u03a3) = \u22122.\n2.3. Visible sector soft masses and a-terms, from the propagators\nOur general results can be summarized as follows. The O(g 2 ) soft susy-breaking\n\ngaugino masses (in particular for the gaugino superpartners of any remaining massless\ngauge field) is\n\n\u0001\n2 AB 2\nmAB\n=\nlim\np\n\u03a3\n(p\n)\n.\ngaugino\n2\np \u21920\n\n(2.6)\n\nThe visible sector sfermion soft masses are computed from the gauge-field propagators as\nZ\nX\nd4 p 1 AB 2\n2\n2\nA\nA\n2\nA B\nmQ = g hJ iTrQ + g\nTrQ TrQ\n\u039e (p ) + O(g 6 ),\n(2.7)\n(2\u03c0)4 p2\nA,B\n\n5\n\nWe normalize these fields to have canonical tree-level kinetic term.\n\n8\n\n\fwhere TrAQ is the group generator in the representation rQ of the matter field Q. The first\nterm in (2.7) generalizes the hypercharge contribution of the MSSM, the Yf \u03be contribution6\nof [1]; one often imposes messenger parity to kill this term. The second term in (2.7) is\ngenerated by the diagrams of fig. 1 (diagrams D2, D3, D4 give the terms in (2.4)).\nFinally, there are visible sector susy-breaking A-terms. These are conveniently described by keeping the auxiliary components FQ of the visible sector matter fields Q, as\nthen the A-terms all arise from the susy-breaking term\nLef f \u2283 AQ F\u0304Q Q\n\nwhich implies\n\nV \u2283 AQ Q\u2202Q W.\n\n(2.9)\n\nClearly, such a term is non-zero only if there is R-symmetry breaking, as R(AQ ) = \u22122. If\n\nthe visible sector has Wtree = mij Qi Qj + Yijk Qi Qj Qk , then (2.9) yields \"non-diagonal\"\n\nsoft masses (m2od )ij \u2261 bij = (Ai + Aj )mij , and scalar trilinear couplings aijk = (Ai + Aj +\nAk )Yijk . By keeping the auxiliary field FQ in (2.9), these terms have a unified description.\n\nThe coefficient AQ is generated by a loop diagram similar to diagram D3 in fig 1, but with\nthe external Q\u2020 replaced with FQ\u2020 . The loop then has a Q matter propagator7 and the\nR-symmetry breaking gaugino mass propagator given in (2.5), giving our result\nAQ = \u22122g\n\n2\n\nX\n\nTrAQ TrBQ\n\nAB\n\nZ\n\nd4 p 1 AB 2\n\u03a3 (p ).\n(2\u03c0)4 p2\n\n(2.10)\n\nThe fact that (2.4) and (2.5) are related to susy-breaking can be seen by noting that\ni\nhQ2 (DA (p)DB (\u2212p))i,\n2\n4p\n\n(2.11)\n\ni\nhQ\u03042 (Q2 (DA (p)DB (\u2212p)))i,\n8p2\n\n(2.12)\n\n\u03a3AB (p2 ) =\n\n\u039eAB (p2 ) =\n6\n\nIt can be written in terms of a D A expectation value using\nhD A i = \u2212ghJ A i.\n\n7\n\n(2.8)\n\nWe use the massless 1/p2 propagator for the Q matter, as in (2.7), because the momentum\n\nintegral gets its main contribution at the messenger scale, where we assume that any tree-level Q\nmass is negligible.

A quick check, comparing with RG running, with explicit soft susy breaking\nThough we're here primarily interested in spontaneous susy breaking, we can also\napply the above expressions to the case of explicit susy breaking. We'll use this as a quick\ncheck of the normalizations, by connecting with known expressions for RG running. As\n2\nAB\na warmup, consider (2.16) and note that, since limp2 \u2192\u221e \u2206AB\n+ O(g 2 ), the\nsusy (p ) \u2192 \u03b4\n\nO(g 2 ) contribution in (2.16) has a log divergence at large p2 , which is cut off using\nZ\nd4 p 1\n1\n\u2192\nln \u039b2 + finite.\n(2.17)\n4\n4\n(2\u03c0) p\n16\u03c0 2\n\nDefining t \u2261 ln \u03bc, and using d/d ln \u039b = \u2212d/dt, we thus obtain from (2.16)\nd ln ZQ\nd ln ZQ\ng2\n=\u2212\n= \u22124\nc2 (rQ ) + O(g 4 ),\nd ln \u039b\ndt\n16\u03c0 2\n\n(2.18)\n\nwhich is the correct expression for the one-loop anomalous dimension.\nNow consider explicit susy breaking, with the gauginos given a soft-breaking mass\nM\u03bb , and the gauge group unbroken. We then have at tree-level \u22060 (p2 ) = \u22061 (p2 ) = 1, and\n\u03a3AB (p2 ) =\n\nM\u03bb\n\u03b4 AB +O(g 2 ),\np2 + |M\u03bb |2\n\n\u039eAB (p2 ) = 4\n\n10\n\n|M\u03bb |2\n+O(g 2 )\np2 + |M\u03bb |2\n\n(explicit breaking).\n(2.19)\n\n\fUsing these in the expressions (2.7) and (2.10), both the m2Q and AQ momentum loop\nintegrals have a log divergence at large p2 , which using (2.17) gives\ng2\nd 2\nmQ \u2283 \u22128\nc2 (rQ )|M\u03bb |2 ,\ndt\n16\u03c0 2\n\nd\ng2\nAQ \u2283 4\nc2 (rQ )M\u03bb .\ndt\n16\u03c0 2\n\n(2.20)\n\nThese agree with the soft term beta functions (see e.g. [48]), giving a check of the minus\nsigns and factors of 2 in (2.7) and (2.10). From here on, we'll only consider spontaneous\nsusy breaking.\n2.5. Computing the propagators, from hidden sector current correlators\nTo use the results (2.13)- (2.15), we express the above gauge field propagators hVVi in\n\nterms of hJ J i current 2-point functions. The main distinction from the unbroken gauge\n\nfield case is that we generally need to consider the full (rather than 1PI) propagator,\nsumming the series of 1PI contributions. The full propagator of the spin 1 gauge field (in\ne1 (p2 ) by\nLandau gauge8 ) is related to the spin 1 current j\u03bc 2-point function's function C\n1\n\n2\n\n\u2206\u03bc\u03bd (p ) \u2261 ihV\u03bc (p)V\u03bd (\u2212p)i =\n\np2 (1\n\n+\n\ne1 (p2 ))\ng2C\n\n\u0012\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd\n\np\u03bc p\u03bd\n\u2212 2\np\n\n\u0013\n\n+ O(g 4 ).\n\n(2.21)\n\nSimilarly, the scalar component D of the vector multiplet V has full propagator\n\u2206(p2 ) \u2261 ihD(p)D(\u2212p)i =\n\n1\n1+\n\ne0 (p2 )\ng2C\n\n+ O(g 4 ).\n\n(2.22)\n\nThe gaugino has full propagator given in terms of the hj\u03b1 j\u0304\u03b1\u0307 i and hj\u03b1 j\u03b2 i functions by\n\u2206\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 (p2 ) \u2261 ih\u03bb\u03b1 (p)\u03bb\u0304\u03b1\u0307 (\u2212p)i =\n\np\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 /p2\n1+\n\ne1/2\ng2C\n\n+\n\ne \u2020 (1\ng4B\n1/2\n\n+\n\ne1/2 /p2\ne1/2 )\u22121 B\ng2C\n\n+ O(g 4 ),\n(2.23)\n\nand mass-type, R-symmetry breaking (R(\u03a3) = \u22122) propagator\n\ni \u03b1\u0307\u03b2\u0307\n\u01eb h\u03bb\u0304\u03b1\u0307 (p)\u03bb\u0304\u03b2\u0307 (\u2212p)i\n2\n(2.24)\n1\n1\n4\ne1/2\n= g2\n+\nO(g\n).\nB\ne1/2\ne1/2 )\u22121 B\ne \u2020 (1 + g 2 C\ne1/2\ne1/2 )p2 + g 4 B\n1 + g2C\n(1 + g 2 C\n1/2\n\n\u03a3(p2 ) =\n\n8\n\nThe final expression for physical masses is, of course, independent of the gauge choice. The\n\neffective potential does depend on the gauge choice. As illustrated in [49], Landau gauge simplifies\ne.g. the form of the effective K\u00e4hler potential.\n\n11\n\n\fUsing these propagators in (2.4), the sfermion mass is given by (2.7), with\n\u039eAB (p2 ) =\n\n1\ne0\n1 + g2C\n\n\u2212\n\n4\ne1/2 /p2\ne1/2 )\u22121 B\ne \u2020 (1 + g 2 C\ne1/2 + g 4 B\n1 + g2C\n1/2\n\n+\n\n3\ne1\n1 + g2C\n\n!AB\n\n.\n\n(2.25)\n\nThese expressions apply in full generality, whether or not the gauge group is broken, and\nwhether or not there are gauge messengers.\n2.6. Broken vs unbroken symmetries\nLet's now summarize how the current correlators, and consequently the gauge multiplet propagators, are affected by spontaneous symmetry breaking. For unbroken geneunbr =\nerators, the current correlators are regular at low-momentum, and are O(g 0 ): C\na\n\nereg \u223c g 0 and B\ne unbr = B\ne reg \u223c g 0 .\nC\na\n1/2\n1/2\n\nFor broken generators, on the other hand, the current 2-point functions get pole\n\ncontributions, where they factorize on the NG boson states:\ne brok = B\ne reg (p2 ),\ne pole (p2 ) + B\nB\n1/2\n1/2\n1/2\n\nebrok (p2 ) = C\nepole (p2 ) + C\nereg (p2 ),\nC\na\na\na\n\n(2.26)\n\nwhere a = 0, 1/2, 1 and the \"pole\" contributions are only present for the Higgsed part of\nthe gauge group. In particular,\ne AB )pole =\n(C\n1\n\n(m2V )AB\n,\ng 2 p2\n\nwith\n\n(m2V )AB = g 2 (v 2 )AB ,\n\n(2.27)\n\ne 1/2 can have similar expressions, though their poles are generally\nepole , C\nepole , and B\nand C\n0\npole\n1/2\ndisplaced away from p2 = 0, to p2 = \u03b4m2a , by susy-breaking effects. All of the pole\n\ncontributions in (2.26) are proportional to m2V /g 2 .\n\nA key point is that we consider a perturbative expansion, of small g, but with fixed\nmV . Then, while the \"reg\" contributions in (2.26) are O(g 0 ) in our counting, the pole\nepole and B\ne pole are counted as O(g \u22122 ), and then the full propagators, with\ncontributions C\na\n1/2\nthe 1PI contributions resumed, are needed. The pole contribution (2.27) then shifts the\n\npole of the full gauge field propagator to be at m2V , corresponding to the gauge field getting\n\na mass from the Higgs (Schwinger) mechanism. The current algebra approach does not\nassume weak coupling. The other full propagators are similar: the other components of\nthe massive vector multiplet get mass m2V + \u03b4m2a , where \u03b4m2a are susy-breaking shifts.\n12\n\n\f2.7. Special cases and connecting with earlier results\nFor unbroken gauge groups, or more generally for unbroken subgroups of partially\nbroken groups, the above resumed propagators are overkill: since their hidden sector\ncurrent-correlators are O(g 0 ) and we work to O(g 2 ), we should simply expand out the\n\ndenominators in (2.21), (2.22), (2.23), and (2.24).

The general expression,\nobtained by using (2.36) in the momentum integral (2.7) will be rather complicated. But\ne pole = 0 (e.g.\nfor a certain class of theories, the result is readily evaluated: in cases where B\n1/2\n\nea (p2 ) each have just a single pole term,\nif there is an unbroken U (1)R ), and where the C\n\nthe result of integrating (2.36) in (2.7) is simply\n(m2Q )(1)\n\ng 2 \u2206cQ 2\n=\nm ln\n16\u03c0 2 V\n\n\u0012\n\nm6V m2C\nm8\u03bb\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(2.37)\n\n\u2032\nwhere \u2206cQ \u2261 c2 (rQ\n) \u2212 c2 (rQ ) accounts for the sum over massive generators.

In\nthis limit, the one-loop contribution to sfermion m2Q (whether or not one restricts to the\nclass of theories mentioned before (2.37)) reduces to\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6)(F\u0304 , F ) \u2212 (\u03c6\u0304, F )(F\u0304 , \u03c6)\ng2\n2 (1)\n\u2206cQ\n(mQ ) = \u2212\n+ O(|F |4 ).\n2\n16\u03c0\n(\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6)(\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6)\nThe inner product in (2.38) is defined as e.g.\nX \u2020\n\u03c6i {T A , T B }\u03c6i = (m2V )AB /g 2 ,\n(\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6)AB \u2261\n\n(F\u0304 , \u03c6)AB \u2261\n\ni\n\nX\ni\n\n(2.38)\n\nF\u0304i {T A , T B }\u03c6i , (2.39)\n\netc. (and we simplified (2.38) by assuming that the broken generator expectation values\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nsatisfy (\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6)A B = (\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6)\u03b4 A B , (F\u0304 , \u03c6)A B = (F\u0304 , \u03c6)\u03b4 A B , and (F\u0304 , F )A B = (F\u0304 , F )\u03b4 A B ).\nThe expression (2.38) for the one-loop m2Q is manifestly always tachyonic. For large\nmV , it exhibits decoupling, giving m2Q \u223c |F |2 /|mV |2 . This parameteric dependence is\n\nsimilar to the usual 2-loop masses in theories without gauge messengers, m2 \u223c |F |2 /|M |2 ,\n\nwith M the mass of the non-gauge messenger hidden sector field. Actually, the one-loop\ncontribution (2.38) has even faster decoupling if the large mV is associated with a large\ngoldstino pseudomodulus expectation value (as in the inverted hierarchy [4] type models).\nAs we'll show (using results from [30]), for large goldstino pseudomodulus the one-loop m2Q\ncontribution (2.38) scales as m2 \u223c \u03b1|F |3 /|M |4 . This is special to the one-loop contribution,\n\nand the two-loop contribution exhibits normal m2 \u223c \u03b12 |F |2 /|M |4 . So in this case, if the\ngoldstino pseudomodulus is sufficiently large, the one loop contribution could end up being\nparameterically suppressed as compared with the two-loop contribution.\nNow consider the a-terms, given by (2.10).

More generally,\nfor arbitrary susy-breaking, these one-loop effects can in principle be determined from\nthe one-loop Coleman-Weinberg potential, computed as a function of non-zero Q and FQ\nbackground expectation values. Aspects of this connection will be given in an appendix.\n2.9. Two loop contributions to m2Q\nOur general expression (2.7) also gives the O(g 4 ) two-loop contribution to m2Q , upon\n\nusing the O(g 2 ) term of (2.35). This contribution is present for both broken and unbroken\n\ngauge fields coupling to the visible sector. For unbroken gauge fields, (2.28) applies. For\nbroken gauge fields, we need to expand (2.25) using (2.26), treating the regular contributions as a perturbation, e.g.\n1\n1+\n\nea (p2 )\ng2C\n\n=\n\n1\n1+\n\neapole (p2 )\ng2C\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n1+\n\neapole (p2 )\ng2C\n\ne reg (p2 )\ng2C\na\n\n1\n1+\n\nwhere the first term is O(g 0 ) and the second is O(g 2 ).\n\neapole (p2 )\ng2C\n\n+ O(g 4 ),\n(2.41)\n\nThere are tachyonic contributions to the two-loop m2Q masses, mediated by both\n\nmassless and massive gauge fields, as in Fig. 2a and 2b.

One-loop gaugino masses, enhanced already at O(F )\nOur general expression (2.6) for the susy-breaking contribution to the gaugino mass\napplies for both the broken G\u2032 /G generators, as well as the unbroken G generators. Let's\nconsider, in particular, the masses of the gaugino partners of the massless G gauge fields.\nIn this case, using (2.29), the expression (2.6) reduces to the expression of [1]\n2 e unbr\nmunbr\ngaugino = g B1/2 (0)\n\n(unbroken (sub) groups).\n\n(2.45)\n\nAlthough the expression is the same as in cases without gauge messengers, the gauge\nmessengers can still have a dramatic effect; they can provide a beneficial enhancement of\nthese gaugino masses as compared with the standard, non-gauge messenger case.\nLet's first recall the suppression of gaugino masses in the case of gauge mediation\nwithout gauge messengers. The effect is evident at O(F ) in a small-susy breaking expansion, and the higher order in F terms in the more general case do not alter the result much.\nIn this limit hidden sector matter contributes\n\u0013\n\u0012\nX Fi\nF 2\nunbr\ne\n(no gauge messengers)\n+O F\nB1/2 (0) =\nci\nMi\nM2\ni\n\u0013\n\u0012\nF 2\n(weakly coupled),\n=0+O F\nM2\n\n(2.46)\n\nwhere ci is the contribution to the OPE coefficient in (2.42), given by ci = T2 (ri ) in\nweakly coupled theories.

We'll illustrate all this for some weakly coupled examples in sect. 7.\n2.11. Generalizing to visible sector pseudomodulus effective potentials\nSuppose that the visible sector has some classical D and F flat moduli, as is the case\nin the MSSM. Then susy-breaking effects from the hidden sector generate an effective\npotential Vef f (Q, Q\u0304), which reduces to Vef f (Q, Q\u0304) \u2248 m2Q |Q|2 near the origin. The full\n\nform of the effective potential, for hQi away from the origin, could be useful for some\napplications, e.g. cosmology, if the fields happen to start away from the origin (see [50] for\n\ndiscussion and analysis in the context of weakly coupled ordinary gauge mediation).

We are here considering the \"doubled\" NG case,\n\nin the terminology of the large literature14 on NG bosons in susy theories. As exhibited\n\u2032\n\nwith (3.10), the broken currents j \u03bcA (x) act as interpolating fields, to create the NG boson\n\u2032\n\nstate |\u03c0 A (p)i from the vacuum. We'll now use the supermultiplet structure of the chiral\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nsuperfield (3.13) to show that J A and j\u03b1A likewise act as interpolating fields to create the\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nstates |\u03c3 A (p)i and |\u03c8\u03c0A (p)i, respectively, from the vacuum.\n\nConsider first the case of unbroken susy, which was already considered in [57,58], whose\n\nresults we'll now recall. Writing the NG boson fields as the chiral superfield (3.13), we\nhave e.g. [Q\u03b1 , \u03c6] = \u2212i\u03c8\u03b1 , {Q\u03b1 , \u03c8\u03b2 } = 2i\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 F , {Q\u0304\u03b1\u0307 , \u03c8\u03b1 } = 4\u2202\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 \u03c6, etc., where \u03c6 = \u03c3 + i\u03c0.\n\nThe states, on the other hand, transform like the functional derivative with respect to the\nfield, so Q\u03b1 |\u03c6i = 0, Q\u03b1 |\u03c8\u03b2 i = \u2212i\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 |\u03c6i, Q\u03b1 |\u03c6\u0304i = 4ip\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 |\u03c8\u0304 \u03b1\u0307 i etc., which yields e.g.\nQ\u03b1 |\u03c3i = \u2212iQ\u03b1 |\u03c0i = 2ip\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 |\u03c8\u0304 \u03b1\u0307 i,\n14\n\nQ\u03b1 |\u03c8\u03b2 i = \u2212i\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 |\u03c6i,\n\nQ\u03b1 |\u03c8\u0304\u03b1\u0307 i = \u22122ip\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 |F i,\n\n(3.14)\n\nThe \"non-fully doubled\" case refers to the possibility that some of the NG supermultiplets\n\ncan have both \u03c0 and \u03c3 in (3.13) being true NG bosons. The fully doubled case occurs e.g. if G/H is\na symmetric space; see e.g. [54] for a nice discussion. Much of the large literature on (pseudo) NG\nbosons in supersymmetric theories considers ungauged symmetries, where both fully doubled and\nnon-fully doubled are viable possibilities. Gauging a case with non-doubled NG bosons would lead\nto a peculiarity: there would not be enough bosons in the spectrum to complete the longitudinal\npolarization of a massive vector supermultiplet, so supersymmetry would be \"shattered\" [55,52].\nWe believe that this phenomenon can not occur, that the NG bosons of gauged symmetries must\nbe fully doubled, to avoid gauge anomalies (as seen in the example presented in [56]).\n\n23\n\n\fwhere |\u03c6i = |\u03c3i+i|\u03c0i. It follows from (3.14) that e.g. [Q\u0304\u03b1\u0307 , Q\u03b1 ]|\u03c0i = \u22124\u2202\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 |\u03c3i. Combining\n\nthis with the susy-relation (3.2) between j\u03bc and J, it follows that\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n1\nh\u03c0 A (p)|j\u03bcB (x)|0i = \u2212 \u03c3\u0304\u03bc\u03b1\u0307\u03b1 h\u03c0 A (p)|[Q\u0304\u03b1\u0307 , Q\u03b1 ]J B (x)|0i = h\u03c3 A (p)|ip\u03bc J B (x)|0i.\n4\n\n(3.15)\n\nLikewise, we can use the susy relation (3.2), j\u03b1 = \u2212i[Q\u03b1 , J], and (3.14) to relate h\u03c8\u03b1 |j\u03b2 |0i\nto h\u03c3|J|0i.

There are still pole contributions C\na\n\na = 1/2, from where they factorize on the \u03c3 and \u03c8\u03c0 states, respectively. But now the pole\n\nare shifted away from p2 = 0, and are instead at the susy-breaking masses \u03b4m20 \u2261 m2\u03c3 , and\n\u03b4m21/2 \u2261 m2\u03c8\u03c0 :\n\ne\u2032 (p2 )pole =\nC\na\n\nv2\np2 + \u03b4m2a\n\nsingle pole case,\n\n(3.20)\n\nwith \u03b4m21 \u2261 0, of course, since the NG boson \u03c0 remains massless. As we have noted,\nthe coefficient v in the one-point functions (3.16) are equal, even if susy is spontanesouly\n\nbroken. So supersymmetry, even if spontaneously broken, implies that the residues in\n(3.20) are all equal to v 2 , for a = 0, 1, 2. As we'll discuss shortly, (3.20) is a special case,\nand more generally there are several poles.\nAn example of how the partners \u03c3 and \u03c8\u03c0 can get susy-breaking masses is via\nWsplit =\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n1\n(\u03b4m1/2 + |\u03b4m1/2 |2 \u03b8 2 )\u03a0A \u03a0A ,\n2\n\n(3.21)\n\nwhere the \u03b8 2 term keeps \u03c0 massless. It follows from (3.21) that the susy-breaking mass\nsplittings of the scalar and fermion partners of the NG boson are related\n\u03b4m20 = 2\u03b4m21/2\n\n(F-term breaking)\n\n(3.22)\n\nwhich is a characteristic relation of F-term breaking. We'll briefly discuss D-type breaking\nlater, and note that the relation (3.22) does not hold in that case. The example (3.21)\nis incompatible with an R-symmetry, but it has a simple variant that is compatible with\nunbroken R-symmetry:\nWsplit,R =\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n1\n|\u03b4m1/2 |2 \u03b8 2 \u03a0A \u03a0A + \u03b4m1/2 \u03a0A \u03a8A ,\n2\n\n(3.23)\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere \u03a8A are some other fields, and (3.23) respects an unbroken U (1)R symmetry under\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nwhich R(\u03a0A ) = 0 and R(\u03a3A ) = 2. It gives susy breaking mass splittings in the NG boson\nsupermultiplet which also satisfy (3.22).\nIn (3.20) we have written a single pole term. More generally (and as we'll illustrate\nepole (p2 ) and C\nepole (p2 ) can have a sum of pole terms\nin weakly coupled examples), C\n0\n1/2\nepole =\nC\n0\n\nX\ni\n\nr0,i\n,\n2\np + \u03b4m20,i\n\n25\n\ne pole =\nC\n1/2\n\nX\ni\n\np2\n\nr1/2,i\n.\n+ \u03b4m21/2,i\n\n(3.24)\n\n\fSupersymmetry, even if it's spontaneously broken, implies that the sum of the residues\nof these poles are constrained to equal v 2 . The multi-pole situation occurs if the NG\nsuperfield \u03a0 couples to some other fields \u03a8, by a slightly more involved analog of the\nsuperpotential (3.23), e.g.\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u2032 \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nW = M + \u03b8 2 (|M |2 + |\u03b4m2 |) \u03a0A \u03a0A + \u03b4m\u03a0A \u03a8A .\n\u2032\n\n(3.25)\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nIn this case, the superpartners \u03c3 A and \u03c8\u03c0A of the NG boson \u03c0 A mix with the other fields\nof the susy-breaking sector.\nPerhaps it's worth commenting on our terminology. Once susy is broken, and the\nepole (p2 ) and C\nepole (p2 ) are displaced away from p2 = 0, the reader might question\npoles of C\n0\n1/2\n\nthe meaning of the distinction between the \"pole\" and \"regular\" contributions in (2.26) to\nea6=1 (p2 ) and B\ne1/2 (p2 ). Our view is that it does remain useful, even when susy is sponthe C\n\ntaneously broken, to make the distinction between the \"pole\" contributions, which come\nfrom factorizing the current two-point functions onto one-point functions, and the \"regular\" contributions, which do not (it might be better to refer to the terms as \"reducible\" and\n\"irreducible,\" but we'll stick with \"pole\" and \"reg,\" respectively). An important distinction between the pole and regular contributions is that they contribute at different orders\nof small g perturbation theory. Again, this is because we take mV = O(g 0 ), and hence\nepole and B\ne pole are \u221d v 2 = O(g \u22122 ), versus the regular contributions, which are O(g 0 ).\nC\na\n1/2\n\nWe can give a general parameterization of the leading susy-breaking effects by conepole (p2 ) and B\ne pole (p2 ) in the limit p2 \u2192 \u221e.

Note that the masses M02\n\n2\nand M1/2\nin (3.31) are similar to the standard expressions for tree-level masses, but with\n\ng \u2192 0. The g 6= 0 contributions to the masses will instead come from summing the gauge\n\ncorrections to the propagator. That said, the inclusion of the D-term contribution (3.32)\nperhaps looks strange, because of the g 2 factor. Actually, (3.32) should be understood\n\nas a g-independent contribution, in the g \u2192 0 limit. The point will be that, despite\n\nappearances, the D contribution to the masses (3.31) can be independent of g, (much as\n\nin the example of [32]), as we'll illustrate with the FI model example.

Gauging the G\u2032 symmetry\nWe now couple the G\u2032 currents to G\u2032 gauge fields, with\nZ\nLint \u2283 \u2212g d4 \u03b8J A V A \u2283 g(JD \u2212 \u03bbj \u2212 \u03bb\u0304j\u0304 \u2212 j \u03bc V\u03bc ).\n\n(3.35)\n\n\u2032\n\nThe NG boson chiral superfields \u03a0A are then, of course, eaten and become the extra\ncomponents of the massive G\u2032 /G vector multiplets: \u03c0 becomes the longitudinal component\nof the gauge field, \u03c3 becomes the real scalar C, and \u03c8\u03c0 becomes the additional gaugino\n\u03c7. This can be illustrated in various (super) gauge-choice, e.g. unitary gauge, setting \u03a0A\n\n\u2032\n\nto zero in (3.18) and (3.29). Instead, we'll employ Wess-Zumino gauge to set C and \u03c7 to\n\u2032\n\nzero in the gauge multiplet, and their d.o.f. return as coming from the \u03a0A . We'll also\nuse super-Landau gauge. One could use a general gauge adding, and later decoupling,\nunphysical ghost degrees of freedom, but we'll mostly stick to super-Landau gauge.\nBefore getting into the details of the gauge multiplet propagators, let us note a few\nbasic points. The coupling of (3.18) to the vector multiplet yields the terms\nZ\n\u00101\n\u0011 \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nL \u2283 d4 \u03b8g vA\u2032 \u03a0A + h.c.

(3.36)\n2\n\u2032\n\nAs usual, the \u03c0 A coupling in (3.36) is associated with the gauge field v\u03bcA getting a mass\n(m2V )AB = g 2 (v 2 )AB .\n\u2032\n\n(3.37)\n\n\u2032\n\nLikewise, the \u03c3 A DA coupling in (3.36) corresponds to the CD vector multiplet coupling\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nin unitary gauge, with \u03c3 A \u2194 C A , and the interaction in (3.36) gives the propagating\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nreal scalar a supersymmetric mass equal to (3.37). Likewise, (3.36) gives \u03c8\u03c0A \u2194 \u03c7A , the\n\nadditional gaugino of the massive vector multiplet, with (3.36) pairing the fermions with\nsupersymmetric mass equal to (3.36). We can also consider at this stage the susy-breaking\n\u2032\n\neffects. For example, if \u03c3 A gets an additional susy-breaking mass-squared \u03b4m20 , then the\nreal scalar of the vector multiplet has\n(m2C )AB = g 2 (v 2 )AB + (\u03b4m20 )AB .\n\n(3.38)\n\nThis mass shift is positive in unitary theories with only F-term breaking, m2C \u2265 m2V .\n\nThe fermions can get masses from both the coupling in (3.36) and also, for example, the\nsusy-breaking coupling \u03b4m1/2 appearing in (3.23):\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nA\nL \u2283 igvA\u2032 \u03c8\u03c0A \u03bbA + \u03b4m1/2 \u03c8\u03c0A \u03c8\u03a8\n\n29\n\n\u2032\n\n(R-symmetric case),\n\n(3.39)\n\n\fwhich respects a U (1)R symmetry under which R(\u03bb) = R(\u03c8\u03a8 ) = \u2212R(\u03c8\u03c0 ) = 1.

The degeneracy of the gauginos in this case follows from\nthe R-symmetry, as they then marry with a Dirac mass. In theories without R-symmetry,\nthere can be Majorana mass terms m\u03c7 6= 0, and then m2\u03bb1 6= m2\u03bb2 . The massless fermion\n\nin (3.40) is also a consequence of the U (1)R symmetry, as it is then needed for \u03b4m21/2 6= 0,\n\nto contribute a massless fermion with R = 1 to the TrR and TrR3 't Hooft anomalies.\n\nWe'll now re-derive the above mass spectrum from the current-algebra based approach,\ndirectly from our expressions for the gauge multiplet propagators and the pole contributions\nto the current correlators.

Then the two real scalars, D and the component \u03c3 of the NG chiral superfield\n\u03a0, have a matrix of kinetic terms to diagonalize. One linear combination of D and \u03c3 remains a\nnon-propagating auxiliary field, and can thus be set to be a constant. The other eigenvalue is a\npropagating scalar field, called C above, can thus be equivalently thought of as D or \u03c3.\n\n31\n\n\fepole and C\ne pole involve a sum of pole terms, as in\nLet's now consider cases where C\na\n0\n\n(3.24). This happens if the NG superfield \u03a0 couples to other hidden sector fields \u03a8, e.g.\nas in (3.25). In that case, the NG boson's partners \u03c3 and \u03c8\u03c0 have a mass mixing matrix\nwith those other hidden sector fields. Including also the couplings in (3.36), results in\nthe massive vector multiplet fields C, \u03bb, \u03c7 getting masses given by m2V plus appropriate\neigenvalue of the mass mixing matrix. We don't evaluate it explicitly because we'll instead\nuse the current algebra approach. Consider first the tree-level propagator \u2206(0) (p2 ) in\n(3.44), in the case (3.24), where C0pole is the sum of say n terms. Then \u2206(0) (p2 ) has poles\nepole (p2 ) = 0, which is an n-th order polynomial equation in\nat the n solutions of 1 + g 2 C\n0\np2 . One of these solutions is the m2C mass, and the other n \u2212 1 are masses of hidden sector\n(0)\n\nstates that mix with the C field. Similar considerations apply to \u2206\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 (p2 ), which has poles\n\ncorresponding to the gauginos and states they mix with.\nea have a single pole, as in (3.20), the relation (3.22)\nIn the simplest case, where the C\n\nimplies that the massive vector multiplet has tree-level mass supertrace\nStrM 2 |vector multiplet =\n\nX\n\u2212\n\u03b4m20\nbroken A,B\n\nAB\n\nX\n= \u2212\nbroken\n\nAB\n\n2(F\u0304 , F )AB\n< 0 (single pole),\n(\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6)AB\n(3.49)\n\nwhere we used (3.22) to write \u03b4m20 \u2212 4\u03b4m21/2 = \u2212\u03b4m20 and in the last expression we\n\nspecialized to the case of a weakly-coupled hidden sector.\n\nNote that the mass mV of the gauge field has dropped out of the supertrace (3.49),\nand there is an analog of this statement also for the multi-pole case. As discussed above,\ne pole (p2 ) = 0 yield n physical mass-squareds, which we'll call m2 . It\nthe n roots of 1 + g 2 C\n0\nCi\nPn\n2\n2\nfollows from the a = 0 case of (3.27) that i=1 mCi = mV + . . ., where . . . are determined\nepole (p2 ) pole locations, independent of g and m2 . Likewise, it follows from the\nby the C\n0\nV\nPn\n2\n2\na = 1/2 case of (3.27) that i=1 m\u03bbi = mV + . . .. So if we take a super-trace over the\nmassive vector multiplet, along with the hidden sector states that they mix with, we get\nm2V (1 \u2212 4 + 3) + . . . and the m2V drops out, generalizing the observation about (3.49).\n\nThis observation that mV drops out of StrM 2 |V can be applied as follows. Consider\n\ntaking mV to be much larger than all other mass scales in the theory (say in the single-pole\ncase, for simplicity). One could then consider a low-energy description of the hidden sector,\nin which the ultra-massive vector multiplet was integrated out. If the hidden sector has\nspontaneous susy-breaking at tree-level, with a weakly coupled description and canonical\nK\u00e4hler potential in the UV, then the full theory has StrM 2 = 0. Since the massive vector\n32\n\n\fmultiplet has supertrace (3.49), the remaining light fields of the hidden sector low-energy\ntheory for mV large and integrated out must have opposite supertrace\nX\nStrM 2 |low = +\n\u03b4m20\nbroken A,B\n\nAB\n\n=\n\nX\n\nbroken\n\nA,B\n\n2(F\u0304 , F )AB\n> 0.\n(\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6)AB\n\n(3.50)\n\nThis can be compared with the general formula [61]\nStrM 2 = 2Rkl\u0304 F k F\u0304 l\u0304 ,\n\n(3.51)\n\nand the result of [21] for the curvature of the tree-level K\u00e4hler potential of the light fields\nwhen vector multiplets are integrated out:\nRkl\u0304 =\n\nX\n\nbroken\n\nA,B\n\n2((T A )jk (T B )l\u0304j + (T A )kl\u0304 Tr\u2032 T B )\n.\n(\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6)AB\n\n(3.52)\n\nUsing this in (3.51), the first term in (3.52) indeed agrees with (3.50), and the second term\ndoes not contribute here because we're taking hDA i = 0 (and we see from (2.2) that we're\n\nhere assuming that F\u0304 T A F = 0).\n\n4. Gauge mediation by unbroken G gauge fields for G\u2032 \u2192 G\nConsider the general situation with UV gauge group G\u2032 , spontaneously broken to\nsubgroup G \u2282 G\u2032 at some energy scale mV . In this section, we consider the susy-breaking\n\neffects which are mediated by the massless G gauge fields. As a concrete example, we\n\ncan consider G\u2032 = SU (5)GUT and G = SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1), but our discussion will be\n\ncompletely general. Because unbroken gauge groups do not have tree-level susy-splittings\n(gauge messengers), the G\u2032 mediated effects can be considered in the framework of [1],\nwithout much modification. The main modification is that, for non-Abelian groups, the\nmassive G\u2032 /G gauge fields contribute in the loop to affect the G current correlators, acting\nas additional messengers with unusual signs.\nThe results for the soft masses are as follows.

The unbroken gauge fields do not have the\npole contributions to their propagators, so \u039eunbr reduces as in (4.2) to the expression of\n[1]. The broken contribution in (4.1) comes from the massive G\u2032 /G gauge fields coupling\ndirectly to the visible sector fields, as in Fig. 2b, and we defer discussing these contributions to the following section. Since we're just discussing the unbroken contributions in\nthis section, we'll henceforth drop the \"unbroken\" superscript reminders.\nThe massive G\u2032 /G gauge fields contribute to the G currents, and thus to the unbroken\ne1/2 and C\nea correlators:\nB\neaunbr (p2 ) = C\neagauge (p2 ) + C\neamatter (p2 ),\nC\n\n(4.3)\n\ne unbr (p2 ) = B\ne matter (p2 ).\ne gauge (p2 ) + B\nB\n1/2\n1/2\n1/2\n\nThe \"matter\" contributions are those from the hidden sector which may or may not be\nweakly coupled, much as in [1]. The \"gauge\" contribution can be computed in g perturbation theory. They account for the correction, from a loop of massive gauge fields, to\nthe propagators of the unbroken gauge fields (the analog of the correction to the photon\npropagator from a W \u00b1 loop), as in Fig. 3. Note that the group theory implies that both\nof the gauge fields running in the loop, labeled A\u2032 and B \u2032 in Fig. 3, are massive \u2013 there\nis no diagram with one internal massive and one internal massless gauge field. This is\nbecause a broken and an unbroken generator can only combine to give a broken genera\u2032\n\ntor18 , [G\u2032 /G, G] \u2282 G\u2032 /G, i.e. f AB C = 0. Since diagrams with a gauge loop like Fig. 3\n\u2032\n\nwould have a factor of f AB C from a diagram with one massive and one massless internal\n\npropagator, it can only get contributions if both internal propagators are for massive G\u2032 /G\ncomponents.\nea (p2 ) is controlled by a constant coefficient, c, as in\nThe UV behavior of the functions C\nea \u223c c log \u039b. c gives the contribution of the sector to the beta function of the gauge\n(3.4), C\n18\n\nTo see this, take all the G\u2032 generators to satisfy (T A T B ) =\n\u2032\n\n1 AB\n\u03b4 ,\n2\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nTr(T A T B ) =\n\n1 A\u2032 B \u2032\n\u03b4\n,\n2\n\nTr(T A T B ) = 0, where A, B run over the unbroken subgroup G, and A , B \u2032 run over the broken\nG\u2032 /G.

Massive gauge messengers' direct coupling to the visible sector\nThe effects discussed in the previous section, are not too different from the general\ngauge mediation setup of [1], aside from the massive G\u2032 /G messenger contribution with\ncgauge < 0. We now discuss the direct coupling of the massive G\u2032 /G gauge messengers\nto the visible sector matter. Because this is direct coupling of susy-breaking messengers\nto the visible sector, it leads to more dramatic differences from the non-gauge messenger\ncase, with visible sector soft terms generated at one lower loop order.\nThe contribution of the massive gauge fields to the sfermion m2Q (2.7) is given by\nZ\nX\nd 4 p 1 A\u2032 B \u2032 2\n2\n2\nA\u2032 B \u2032\n\u039e\n(p ),\n(5.1)\nmQ \u2283 g\nTrQ TrQ\n(2\u03c0)4 p2\n\u2032\n\u2032\nA ,B\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere the sum is over the broken generators A\u2032 , B \u2032 , and \u039eA B (p2 ) is as defined in (2.4), and\ne A\u2032 B\u2032 given by the sum of pole and regular contributions,\neA\u2032 B\u2032 and B\ngiven by (2.25), with C\na\n\n1/2\n\nas in (2.26). The regular contributions don't know that the symmetry is spontaneously\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nbroken, so they're all proportional to \u03b4 A B . If the pole contributions are also such that the\nA\u2032 and B \u2032 broken generators have a single Higgsing scale, then they're also proportional to\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03b4 A B , so \u039eA B (p2 ) = \u039e(p2 )\u03b4 A B , and then the sum over broken generators in (5.1) gives\nX\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nTrA\u2032 TrA\u2032 = \u2206cQ 1|rQ | ,\n\u2206cQ \u2261 c2 (rQ\n) \u2212 c2 (rQ ),\n(5.2)\nbroken A\u2032\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\n36\n\n\fwith \u2206cQ > 0. For simplicity, we'll consider this single Higgsing scale case in what follows.\nOur results can be straightforwardly adapted for a more general case by adding analogous\ncontributions for each Higgsing scale.\nThe one loop contribution to m2Q is given by (5.1) and the expression (2.25) for \u039e, upon\nusing the O(g 0 ) term in \u039e, coming from the pole contributions to the 2-point functions\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n\u039e(0) (p2 ) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n1\n\u2212\nepole (p2 )\n1 + g2C\n0\n\n4\n1+\n\nepole\ng2C\n1/2\n\n+\n\ne\n\npole 2\ng 4 |B1/2\n|\npole\n2\n2\np (1+g C1/2 )\n\n+\n\n3\n1+\n\ne\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\nepole \uf8f8\ng2C\n1\n\n(5.3)\n\nThe two loop contribution to m2Q is also given by (5.1), using the O(g 2 ) contribution\n\u039e(1) (p2 ), obtained from expanding (2.25) using (2.26), with the \"regular\" contributions\n\ngiving the higher loop order. Since it is a straightforward expansion, see e.g. (2.41), we\nwon't bother to write out explicitly the general, lengthy expression for \u039e(1) (p2 ).\nTo go farther, we will need to evaluate the integral in (5.1) using the explicit expresea and B\ne1/2 in a given theory.

Susy relations and small susy-breaking expansions\n6.1. susy relations among current correlators, and gauge propagators\nAs shown in [21], the current supermultiplet structure implies the relations (2.30),\ne1/2 (p2 ),\nhQ2 (J(p)J(\u2212p))i = \u22124B\n\ne0 (p2 ) \u2212 4C\ne1/2 (p2 ) + 3C\ne1 (p2 )).\nhQ\u03042 (Q2 (J(p)J(\u2212p))i = 8p2 (C\n\n(6.1)\n\nHere we instead note that there are analogous relations for the gauge field propagators\n1\nhQ2 (D(p)D(\u2212p)i = h\u03bb\u0304\u03b1\u0307 (p)\u03bb\u0304\u03b1\u0307 (\u2212p)i\n4p2\n1\nhQ\u03042 (Q\u03042 (D(p)D(\u2212p)))i = \u039e(p2 ),\n8p2\n20\n\n(6.2)\n\nSuch a soft-breaking potential was considered in [51], and their result can be compared with\n\ne1/2 (p2 ) is replaced with a momentum-independent constant m\u03bb .\nthe special case where our B\n41\n\n\fwhere \u039e(p2 ) is as defined in (2.4).\n\nThese relations are obtained from the susy-\n\ntransformations of the fields in the vector multiplet, e.g. [53]:\n \u0304 m \u2202m \u03bb \u2212 \u03be\u03c3 m \u2202m \u03bb\u0304,\n\u03b4\u03be D = \u03be\u03c3\u0304\n\n\u03b4\u03be \u03bb = i\u03beD \u2212 \u03c3 mn \u03bevmn .\n\n(6.3)\n\nThe susy relations for the gauge multiplet are related to those of the current multiplet by\nLegendre transform, since D \u2194 \u03b4/\u03b4J, \u03bb\u03b1 \u2194 \u03b4/\u03b4j \u03b1 , V\u03bc \u2194 \u03b4/\u03b4j \u03bc .\n\nBoth (6.1) and (6.2) apply whether or not the J symmetry is spontaneously broken.\n\nIn the case where the J symmetry is not spontaneously broken, the relations (6.1) and\n\n(6.2) coincide with each other (to the relevant g 2 order), and they imply the relations (2.31)\nand (2.32) of [21]. When the J symmetry is broken, on the other hand, it is the relations\n(6.2), and not the relations (6.1), which are relevant for computing the soft susy-breaking\nterms, as in (2.13) and (2.14).\n6.2. connection with small susy-breaking limits\nThe above results can be connected with spurion-based methods when susy-breaking\neffects are small. The idea is that\nhQ2 (\u22c6)i = 4h(\u22c6)susy i|\u03b82 + O(F |F |2 ),\n\nhQ\u03042 (Q2 (\u22c6))i = 16h(\u22c6)susy i|\u03b82 \u03b8\u03042 + O(|F |4 ) (6.4)\n\nwhere (\u22c6)susy denotes the quantity computed first in the limit of unbroken susy, and\nthen replacing the parameters with spurions, which can have susy-breaking \u03b8 2 and \u03b8 4\ncomponents. Applied to (6.1) this yields the following relations, which were originally\nobtained in [17,18]:\ne AB +O(F |F |2 ),\neAB (p2 )|\u03b82 = \u2212B\nC\nsusy\n1/2\n\ne AB \u22124C\neAB +3C\neAB )+O(|F |4 ).\neAB (p2 )| 2 2 = 1 p2 (C\nC\n0\n1\nsusy\n\u03b8 \u03b8\u0304\n1/2\n2\n(6.5)\n\nThe relations (6.5) remain valid in the gauge messenger case, where the symmetry\nea and B\ne1/2 above should be underis spontaneously broken, and then the quantities C\n\nstood as the sum of the regular and pole contributions. Consider, in particular, the pole\ncontributions. In the limit of unbroken susy, we have\n\n(\u03a6\u0304, \u03a6)AB\n\u03a6\u0304{T A , T B }\u03a6\npole AB\ne\n\u2261\n.\n(Csusy )\n=\np2\np2\n\n(6.6)\n\nTo leading order in small susy-breaking, the relation (6.6) is preserved, where we use a\nspurion analysis, with chiral superfields \u03a6 = \u03c6+\u03b8 2 F . We are considering multiple spurions,\n42\n\n\fand could decorate \u03a6 with flavor and gauge indices, but we'll suppress the indices. We\nthen have the superspace expansion\n1 2 2 2 AB\n(\u03b4m20 )AB , (6.7)\n(MV2 )AB = g 2 (\u03a6\u0304, \u03a6)AB = (m2V )AB +\u03b8 2 (m2V )AB mAB\n\u03c7 +h.c.+ \u03b8 \u03b8\u0304 (mV )\n2\nwhere we define\n(m2V )AB \u2261 g 2 (\u03c6\u03040 , \u03c60 )AB ,\n\n\u2261\nmAB\n\u03c7\n\n(\u03c6\u03040 , F0 )AB\n,\n(\u03c6\u03040 , \u03c60 )AB\n\n(\u03b4m20 )AB \u2261 2\n\n(F\u03040 , F0 )AB\n.\n(\u03c6\u03040 , \u03c60 )AB\n\n(6.8)\n\nThe relations (6.5) imply that\n\nepole\nC\n0\n\nAB\n\ne pole\nB\n1/2\n\nAB\n\nepole\n\u2212 4C\n1/2\n\n=\u2212\n\nAB\n\n(\u03c6\u0304, F )AB\n+ O(F |F |2 ),\np2\n\ne pole\n+ 3C\n1\n\nAB\n\n=\n\n2(F\u0304 , F )AB\n+ O(|F |4 ).\np4\n\n(6.9)\n\n(6.10)\n\nThese relations can be explicitly verified in the weakly coupled case, by expanding out the\npole contributions given in (3.30). We can also immediately verify them in the limit of\nlarge p2 , via the expansions (3.26).\nBut it is the susy relations (6.2) among the propagators, rather than the susy relations\n(6.1) among the current correlators, which are relevant for finding the soft breaking terms\nin the gauge messenger case. Applying the relation (6.4) in the small susy-breaking limit,\nwe find the appropriate relations, analogous to (6.5):\n\u03a3AB (p2 ) =\n\n1 AB\n\u2206\n|\u03b82 + O(F |F |2 ),\np2 susy\n\n(6.11)\n\n\u039eAB (p) =\n\n2 AB\n\u2206\n| 2 2 + O(|F |4 ),\np2 susy \u03b8 \u03b8\u0304\n\n(6.12)\n\nand\n\nwhere we have for the full hDA (p)DB (\u2212p)i propagator\n\u2206AB\nsusy\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nesusy\n1 + g2C\n\n\u0013AB\n\n,\n\n(6.13)\n\ninitially computed for unbroken susy, and then extended to depend on susy-breaking spurions.

The propagator then has O(g 0 ) and\n\nO(g 2 ) terms:\n2\n\n\u2206susy (p ) =\n\n\u0012\n\np2\np2 + MV2\n\n\u0013AB \u0014\u0012\n+\n\n\u0013\n\np2\np2 + MV2\n\nereg )\n(\u2212g C\nsusy\n2\n\n\u0012\n\np2\np2 + MV2\n\n\u0013\u0015AB\n\n+O(g 4 ). (6.15)\n\n6.3. hidden sector contributions to visible sector wavefunction ZQ\nThe above expressions motivate considering the hidden sector contribution to the\nwavefunction ZQ factor, which can be computed from the diagrams of fig. 1, computed\nwith non-zero external momentum k, taking \u2202/\u2202k 2 before setting k \u2192 0. In the limit of\n\nunbroken susy, this gives\n\nZQ \u2283 1 \u2212 2g\n\n2\n\nX\n\nTrAQ TrBQ\n\nA,B\n\nZ\n\nd4 p 1 AB 2\n\u2206\n(p ).\n(2\u03c0)4 p4 susy\n\n(6.16)\n\nTo leading order in the small susy-breaking limit, this relation is preserved as a relation\nin superspace, with both sides picking up \u03b8 2 and \u03b8\u0304 2 components. Comparing (6.16) with\n(2.14) and (2.15), and using (6.4) and (6.11) and (6.12), we then have in the small susybreaking limit:\nAQ = ZQ |\u03b82 + O(F |F |2 ),\n\nm\ne 2Q = \u2212ZQ |\u03b82 \u03b8\u03042 + O(|F |4 ).\n\n(6.17)\n\nWith these relations, we recover the expected relations from spurion methods.\nConsider first the one-loop O(g 2 ) contribution to the Z-factor (6.16), which is obtained\n\nby using the first term in (6.15).

One loop a-terms and sfermion masses, in the small susy-breaking limit\n\nLet's consider first the one-loop contribution to AQ and m2Q , which are obtained from\n(6.17) and (6.19). Using (MV2 )AB = g 2 (\u03a6\u0304, \u03a6)AB and the expansion (6.7), we obtain the\none loop A-term:\n(1)\n\nAQ =\n\ng2\ng 2 \u2206cQ\n2\n2\n=\nln\nM\n|\n\u2206cQ m\u03c7\nV \u03b8\n8\u03c0 2\n8\u03c0 2\n\nwhere\n\nm\u03c7 =\n\n(\u03c6\u03040 , F0 )\n.\n(\u03c6\u03040 , \u03c60 )\n\n(6.23)\n\nSimilarly, the one-loop contribution to m2Q obtained from (6.17) and (6.19) is\n(m2Q )(1)\n\n\u0012\n\u0013 A\u2032 B \u2032\ng 2 X A\u2032 B\u2032 (\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6)(F\u0304 , F ) \u2212 (\u03c6\u0304, F )(F\u0304 , \u03c6)\n+ O(|F |4 ),\nTrQ TrQ\n=\u2212\n2\n16\u03c0 \u2032 \u2032\n(\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6)(\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6)\nA ,B\n\u0013\n\u0012\ng2\n(\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6)(F\u0304 , F ) \u2212 (\u03c6\u0304, F )(F\u0304 , \u03c6)\n=\u2212\n+ O(|F |4 ),\n\u2206cQ\n2\n16\u03c0\n(\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6)(\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6)\n\n(6.24)\n\nwhere in the second line, we simplified by taking the inner products of the expectation\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nvalues appearing in (6.24) to all be proportional to \u03b4 A B . The one-loop gauge messenger\ncontribution to the sfermion mass-squared is tachyonic, as is manifest from (6.24).\n45\n\n\fThe result (2.38), in the special case when (\u03c6\u0304, F ) = 0, reduces to the small susye1/2 = 0 result (5.5).

We see that the\ncommon view that there are not one-loop contributions to m2Q applies to the Mc\u2020 Mc term\nin (6.20), but generally not to the MV2 term. In the appendix, we will verify more generally,\nto arbitrary order in |F |2 , that our results about the one-loop contributions to m2Q can\n\nequivalently be re-derived directly from the one-loop Coleman-Weinberg effective potential.\n6.5. One loop sfermion masses are suppressed for large goldstino pseudomodulus vev\nThe numerator in (2.38) has an interesting property: it is constant along the goldstino\npseudomodulus flat direction. As proved in [30,66], all models of tree-level spontaneous\nF-term supersymmetry breaking (with canonical K\u00e4hler potential) have a classical pseudomodulus \u2013 that of the goldstino \u2013 which can be parameterized as\n\u03c6xi = \u03c60i + xFi0 ,\n\n(6.26)\n\nwhere x is an arbitrary complex parameter, associated with the expectation value of the\nsuperpartner of the goldstino, and \u03c60i = h\u03c6i i is chosen as a zero of the D-term for any gauge\n\ninteractions, with Fi0 = hF\u03c6i i. It was shown in [30] that the classical D and F terms are\nindependent of the parameter x, in particular Fix = Fi0 , i.e. constant along the goldstino\n\npseudomodulus. In terms of the quantities appearing in (6.24), we therefore have\n(\u03c6\u0304x , \u03c6x )AB = (\u03c6\u03040 , \u03c60 )AB + x(\u03c6\u03040 , F 0 )AB + x\u2217 (F\u0304 0 , \u03c60 )AB + |x|2 (F\u0304 0 , F 0 )\n(F\u0304 x , \u03c6x )AB = (F\u0304 0 , \u03c60 )AB + x(F\u0304 0 , F 0 )AB\n\n(6.27)\n\nfrom which it immediately follows that the numerator in (6.24) is constant along the\ngoldstino pseudomodulus\n(\u03c6\u0304x , \u03c6x )(F\u0304 x , F x ) \u2212 (\u03c6\u0304x , F x )(F\u0304 x , \u03c6x )\n\n\u0001AB\n\n= (\u03c6\u03040 , \u03c60 )(F\u0304 0 , F 0 ) \u2212 (\u03c6\u03040 , F 0 )(F\u0304 0 , \u03c60 )\n46\n\n\u0001AB\n\n.\n\n(6.28)\n\n\fIf the goldstino pseudomodulus has a large expectation value, and if (F\u0304 0 , F 0 ) 6= 0, then\n\nthe gauge group is (perhaps partially) Higgsed at some correspondingly large mass scale\nM . This scale can happen to be parameterically much larger than the typical mass scale \u03bc\nof the superpotential. This is what happens in the inverted hierarchy model [4], where the\ndynamically generated GUT scale is much larger than the mass scale in the superpotential,\nand the large expectation values there are indeed along the goldstino pseudomodulus. It\nfollows from (6.28) that the numerator in (6.24) does not scale with that large scale M ,\nbut is instead O(|\u03bc6 |). In such cases, the one-loop contribution (2.38) to sfermion masses\nis parameterically of the form\n\n(m2Q )(1) \u223c\n\ng 2 |\u03bc|6\n.\n16\u03c0 2 |M |4\n\n(6.29)\n\nThis has a |\u03bc/M |2 \u226a 1 parameteric suppression as compared with the two-loop contribu-\n\ntions,\n\n(m2Q )(2)\n\n\u223c\n\n\u0012\n\ng2\n16\u03c0 2\n\n\u00132\n\n|\u03bc|4\n.\n|M |2\n\n(6.30)\n\nSo, if |\u03bc/M |2 \u226a g 2 /16\u03c0 2 , the one-loop contribution to sfermion m2Q could be negligible\ncompared with the two-loop contributions! This was briefly noted already long ago in a\ncomment appearing in [7] in the context of the inverted hierarchy type models, but no\nexplanation was given there (it was stated without calculation that a certain diagram\nwould be O(\u03bc6 /M 4 ), but other diagrams, which could have contributed at O(\u03bc4 /M 2 ),\nwere not considered). Here we have explained it as coming from the particular general\nproperty of the goldstino pseudomodulus.\nThere can be pseudomoduli other than the goldstino (see e.g. [65]), and the cancellation in (6.28) and above noted suppression of the one-loop m2Q would not occur for large\nexpectation values of those pseudomoduli.\n6.6. One-loop gaugino masses and two-loop m2Q contributions\nConsider the one-loop gaugino masses for the superpartners of the massless gauge\nfields, and the two-loop sfermion m2Q , to leading order in a small susy-breaking expansion.\nWe have seen that these soft terms are given by\n2 e unbr\nmunbr\n(0)|\u03b82 ,\ngaugino \u2248 \u2212g C\n\n(2)\n\n(m2Q )(2) \u2248 \u2212ZQ |\u03b82 \u03b8\u03042 ,\n\n(6.31)\n\n(2)\nesusy (p2 ) is promoted to superspace,\nwhere ZQ is given in (6.22).

This will allow us to similarly connect, now for theories\nwith gauge messengers, with the expressions obtained in [34] using analytic continuation\nin superspace.\nThe relevant functions in (6.31) and (6.22) are of the general form\ne 2) =\nC(p\n\n\u0010 p2\n\u0011\nc\n\u039b2\n+f\n\u2261y\nln\n16\u03c0 2 MV2\nMV2\n\n(6.32)\n\nwhere f (y) is a non-singular function, which is regular at y = 0 and satisfies\nlim f (y) \u2192 \u2212\n\ny\u2192\u221e\n\nc\nln y,\n16\u03c0 2\n\n(6.33)\n\nso the MV2 dependence drops out for large p2 . To give a concrete example, the unbroken\ngauge group has both matter and gauge contributions, C unbr (p2 ) = C unbr,matter (p2 ) +\nC unbr,gauge (p2 ), where the gauge contribution is given by (4.6) with m2V \u2192 MV2 as (6.7),\neunbr,gauge (p2 ) = cgauge\nC\n\nZ\n\nd4 k\n1\n,\n2\n4\n2\n(2\u03c0) (k + MV )((p + k)2 + MV2 )\n\n(6.34)\n\nwhich is of the form (6.32) with c = cgauge given in (4.4). Our point here will be that\nthe quantities (6.31) can be evaluated knowing only the coefficients c in (6.32) and (6.33),\nwithout needing to know the detailed expressions like (6.34).\nUsing the superspace expansion of MV2 , see (6.7) and (6.8), it follows from (6.32) that\n\u0010 c\n\u0011\nd\ne \u03b82 (y) = \u2212\nC|\n+\ny\nf\n(y)\nm\u03c7\n16\u03c0 2\ndy\n\u0011\n\u0010 c\ndf \u0011\u0010 1 2\nd\u0010 d \u0011\ne \u03b82 \u03b8\u03042 (y) = \u2212\ny f m\u03c7 m\u0304\u03c7 .\n+\ny\n\u03b4m\n\u2212\nm\nm\u0304\n+\ny\nC|\n\u03c7 \u03c7\n16\u03c0 2\ndy 2 0\ndy dy\n\n(6.35)\n\nThe quantity 21 \u03b4m20 \u2212m\u03c7 m\u0304\u03c7 = ((F\u0304 , F )(\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6)\u2212(F\u0304 , \u03c6)(\u03c6\u0304, F ))/(\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6)2 is the same combination\n\nappearing in the one-loop m2Q in (6.24), whose numerator is constant along the goldsino\npseudomodulus direction.\n\nThe one-loop gaugino masses for the superpartners of the unbroken gauge fields are\nthus given, to leading order in small susy-breaking by (6.31) and (6.35) to be\n2 e unbr\nmunbr\n|\u03b82 (y = 0) =\ngaugino \u2248 \u2212g C\n\n48\n\ng 2 unbr\nc\nm\u03c7 .\n16\u03c0 2\n\n(6.36)\n\n\fAs we have already discussed, this one-loop O(F ) term is generally non-zero, unlike theories\nwithout gauge messengers where the gaugino masses are suppressed [28].

Gauge messenger examples\n7.1. A simple class of F-term breaking models\nIn this section, we will illustrate our general results for a simple class of models. Suppose that the susy-breaking hidden sector has a symmetry group G\u2032 , with chiral superfields\nX, \u03c61 , and \u03c62 , in the singlet, r1 , and r2 representations of G\u2032 , respectively. We take the\nreps r1 , and r2 to be real, with r1 \u2297 r1 \u2283 1 and r1 \u2297 r2 \u2283 1. To break susy, we take an\nO'Raifeartaigh-type tree-level superpotential\nW =\n\n1\nhX\u03c61 * \u03c61 + m\u03c61 * \u03c62 + f X,\n2\n\n(7.1)\n\nwhere \u03c61 * \u03c61 denotes the G\u2032 singlet. The G\u2032 symmetry group can be weakly gauged, and\nused to mediate susy-breaking to a visible sector.\n\nSuch examples have been much studied in the old and recent literature. For example\nwe could take G = SU (N ) and r1 and r2 to be adjoints, with the SU (5) case similar to the\ninverted hierarchy model of [4], and the SU (2) case was considered in toy models for the\ninverted hierarchy model in [25,28,29]. The general class of models (7.1) was considered\nrecently [46] as toy models for spontaneous R-symmetry violation: the theory has a U (1)R\nsymmetry with R(X) = R(\u03c62 ) = 2, and R(\u03c61 ) = 0, which is spontaneously broken by the\ngoldstino pseudomodulus hXi =\n6 0 if \u03b7 \u2261 g 2 /h2 is sufficiently large [45,46].\n\nThe G\u2032 symmetry is either unbroken, if y \u2261 |hf /m2 | satisfies y \u2264 1, or is broken to\n\na subgroup, G\u2032 \u2192 G, if y \u2265 1. Upon gauging G\u2032 , the theory with y < 1 does not have\n\ngauge messengers, while the theory with y > 1 does. So we'll here be interested in the\n\ncase y > 1, and we'll take m and f to be real, and set h = 1. The vacua have hXi = X0\narbitrary at tree level and\n\nh\u03c61 i * h\u03c61 i = \u2212v 2 ,\n\u2212hF\u0304\u03c62 i = mh\u03c61 i,\n\nX0\nh\u03c61 i,\nm\n\u2212hF\u0304X i = m2 ,\n\nv\u2261\n\nh\u03c62 i = \u2212\n\np\n2(f \u2212 m2 )\n\n(7.2)\n\nhF\u03c61 i = 0.\n\nThe expectation value of the pseudomodulus X0 in the quantum theory depends on the\nvalue of \u03b7 \u2261 g 2 /h2 . If \u03b7 is sufficiently small, then X0 = 0, and if \u03b7 is sufficiently large\nthen X0 is non-zero, and determined in terms of \u03b7. So we'll consider both the X0 = 0\n\nand X0 6= 0 cases, where the R-symmetry is either unbroken, or spontaneously broken by\nX0 6= 0, respectively. In either case, h\u03c61 i =\n6 0 breaks the G\u2032 symmetry to some subgroup,\nG, and hF\u03c62 i =\n6 0 means that there are gauge messengers.\n50\n\n\fSince these examples are weakly coupled, it's straighforward to compute the G\u2032 currents J and their correlators. In particular, the short distance OPE (2.42) has\ncmatter =\n\n2\nX\n\nT2 (ri ).\n\n(7.3)\n\ni=1\n\nLet's now comment on gaugino masses, considering the case where r1 = r2 . In the theory\nwithout gauge messengers, taking y < 1, the one-loop G\u2032 gauginos remain massless to\nO(F ) (even\nis spontaneously broken by X0 6= 0), as in (2.48), because\n\u0012 if the R-symmetry\n\u0013\nhX m\n\u03c4 \u223c ln det\nis independent of X. But in our y > 1 case the gaugino partners of\nm 0\nthe unbroken G gauge fields do get a one-loop mass at O(F ), given by (2.49)\nmgaugino = \u2212\n\ng2\n(\u03c6\u0304, F )\n,\n(T (G\u2032 ) \u2212 T (G))\n2\n16\u03c0\n(\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6)\n\n(7.4)\n\nwhere we take T (r1 ) = T (r2 ) = T (G\u2032 ) \u2212 T (G), as in the example of [29]. This small-susybreaking result is a good approximation when X0 is large.\n\nIn the following two subsections, we'll focus on the case G\u2032 = SO(N ), with the two\nmatter fields in the representations r1 = r2 = N. For y > 1, the expectation values (7.2)\nbreak SO(N ) \u2192 SO(N \u2212 1). We'll first discuss in detail the case N = 2, where the group\n\nis completely broken. Next, we'll discuss N > 2, where there are massless SO(N \u2212 1)\n\ngauge fields.\n\n7.2. The example with G\u2032 = SO(2) \u223c\n= U (1), a massive gauge field\nIn this section, we consider the simplest model of spontaneous susy and gauge symmetry breaking. We could equivalently write the hidden sector theory in this case in a\nU (1) notation as\nW = f X + X\u03c61+ \u03c61\u2212 + m\u03c61+ \u03c62\u2212 + m\u03c62+ \u03c61\u2212 ,\n\n(7.5)\n\nwhere the \u00b1 subscripts are the U (1) charges, and X is neutral. There is a messenger\n\nparity symmetry, \u03c6i+ \u2194 \u03c6i\u2212 (this symmetry is ensured by Tr T = 0 in SO(2)), so no hJi\nis generated at one-loop. To facilitate our later generalization to SO(N ), we'll stick with\n(a)\n\n(a)\n\nthe SO(2) notation, with superpotential\nwith fields \u03c61 and \u03c62 , with SO(2) index\n\u0012 (7.1), \u0013\n0 i\na = 1, 2, and SO(2) generator T = \u221a12\n. The vacua can be taken to be hXi = X0\n\u2212i 0\n(the classically undetermined goldstino pseudomodulus) and as in (7.2), with in particular\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX0\niv\nimv\nh\u03c61 i =\n,\nh\u03c62 i = \u2212\nh\u03c61 i,\n\u2212hF\u0304\u03c62 i =\n,\n(7.6)\n0\n0\nm\n51\n\n\fwhich are such that the SO(2) D-term vanishes, which minimizes the energy.\nSince h\u03c61 i =\n6 0, the SO(2) is broken, and since hF\u0304\u03c62 i =\n6 0, there are gauge messengers.\n\nThe breaking order-parameters are\n\u0013\n\u0012\nX0 2\n2\n,\n(\u03c6\u03040 , \u03c60 ) = v 1 +\nm\n\n(F\u03040 , F0 ) = m2 v 2 ,\n\n(\u03c6\u0304, F0 ) = \u2212X0 v 2 .\n\nOnce we gauge SO(2), the mass of the SO(2) \u223c\n= U (1) gauge field is\n\u0013\n\u0012\nX0 2\n2\n2\n2 2\n.\nmV = g (\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6) = g v 1 +\nm\n\n(7.7)\n\n(7.8)\n\nThe tree-level undetermined expectation value hXi = X0 is associated with the goldstino\n\npseudomodulus and, as we have noted on general grounds, X0 indeed cancels in\n(\u03c6\u03040 , \u03c60 )(F\u03040 , F0 ) \u2212 (F\u03040 , \u03c60 )(\u03c6\u03040 , F0 ) = v 4 m2 .\n\n(7.9)\n\nIt's straightforward to work out the spectrum of the theory in components, using\nWess-Zumino gauge. We'll discuss this spectrum first, before getting into the description\nin terms of current-correlators. We consider arbitrary values of mV /m, even with g \u226a 1,\n\nby taking sufficiently large v, via taking f sufficiently large.\n\nThe expectation value of the pseudomodulus X0 = hXi in the quantum theory depends\n\non the value of \u03b7 = g 2 /h2 [45,46], where g is the gauge coupling and h in the Yukawa\ncoupling of the cubic term in (7.5) (which we set to 1 here): if \u03b7 is small, hXi = 0, and\nfor larger \u03b7 we can have hXi =\n6 0. For hXi = 0, the U (1)R symmetry of (7.1) is unbroken,\n\nwhereas for hXi =\n6 0 it is spontaneously broken. We'll now first consider the hXi = 0 case,\nand next the hXi =\n6 0 case.\n\nThis hidden sector theory has 5 chiral superfields, including the NG chiral superfield\n\n\u03a0, which is eaten by the vector multiplet. The unbroken U (1)R symmetry for hXi = 0\n\nimplies that one chiral superfield plays the role of the field \u03a8 in (3.23). Using (3.29) and\n\n(7.6), and comparing (3.23) with (7.1), we identify \u03a0 and \u03a8 as the fluctuation of the second\ncomponent of \u03c61 and \u03c62 respectively,\n(2)\n\n\u03a0 = \u03c61\n\n(2)\n\n\u03a8 = \u03c62 ,\n\nwith\n\n\u03b4m1/2 = m\n\n(7.10)\n\n(where the superscripts indicate the second component under SO(2)). In particular, Im(\u03a0)\nis the (eaten) massless NG boson and Re(\u03a0), gives the real scalar with m2C = m2V + 2m2 .\nThe complex scalar component of \u03a8 has complex mass-squared equal to \u03b4m21/2 = m2 . The\n52\n\n\ffermion components \u03c8\u03c0 and \u03c8\u03a8 and the gaugino \u03bb all mix, as in (3.39), and the mass\nq\neigenstates are as in (3.40): there are two gauginos, with mass m2V + \u03b4m21/2 , and one\nmassless fermion. (This massless fermion, together with the massless goldstino, contribute\n\nto saturate the 't Hooft anomaly Tr U (1)R = 2 of the theory with gauged SO(2); without\ngauging SO(2), the 't Hooft anomaly is Tr U (1)R = 1 and the only massless fermion is the\ngoldstino.) In summary, the spectrum of the massive vector multiplet is given by\nfield\n\nV\u03bc\n\nRe(\u03a0)\n\nmass2\n\nm2V = 2g 2 (f \u2212 m2 )\n\nm2C = m2V + 2m2\n\n\u03b4m1/2 \u03c8\u03a8 + imV \u03bb,\n\n\u03c8\u03a0\n\nm2\u03bb = m2\u03c7 = m2V + m2\n(7.11)\n\nwhere V\u03bc contains the NG boson \u2248 Im(\u03a0) as the longitudinal component. The vector\n\nmultiplet thus has (at tree-level)\n\nStrM 2 |vectormultiplet = \u22122m2 .\n\n(7.12)\n(2)\n\nOf course the full theory has StrM 2 = 0, and indeed the complex scalar \u03a8| = \u03c62 | has\n\n2\nmass-squared m2 , and thus contributes StrM\u03a8\n= 2m2 , and so zeros out the contribution\n\n(7.12) of the vector multiplet. If we consider the theory in the limit mV \u226b m, the massive\n\nvector can be integrated out to obtain a low energy theory satisfying (3.50).\n\nThe spectrum of the remaining three chiral superfield degrees of freedom of the hidden\nsector have net StrM 2 = 0 and are less interesting for our considerations here, but we\nnevertheless record them for completness:\nfield\nmass2\n\n(1)\n\nmX+iv\u03c62\n\n\u221a\n\n2f \u2212m2\n\n0S\n\n(1)\n\nm\u03c62 +ivX\n\n\u221a\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c61\n\n2f \u2212m2\n\n(2f \u2212 m2 )S\n\n(2f \u2212 m2 )F\n\n(2f )B\n\n(2f \u2212 2m2 )B\n(7.13)\n\nwhere 0S and (2f \u2212m2 )S refer to a supersymmetric masses for the complete supermultiplet,\n\nand (2f \u2212 m2 )F is the mass of the fermion component, and (2f )B and (2f \u2212 2m2 )B are\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nthe masses of the real scalars Re(\u03c61 ) and Im(\u03c61 ) respectively. The (0)S multiplet is the\n\ngoldstino and pseudomodulus supermultiplet.

To do so, we consider the contributions of the current\neapole . We again first consider the case where hXi = 0, where there\none-point functions to C\ne1/2 = 0.

For simplicity, consider the case of a single SO(2) doublet Q, with tree-level superpotential21 Wvis = \u03bcQQ, where \u03bc is a supersymmetric mass term. Because of the unbroken\nU (1)R symmetry, there is no induced AQ term, i.e. no off-diagonal B\u03bc mass term for the\nscalars Q. The one-loop soft mass-squared for the Q scalars is given by the expression\n(5.5), which here gives\n2 (1)\n\nm\n21\n\ne\nQ\n\ng2\nm2 ln\n=\n32\u03c0 2 V\n\n\u0012\n\nm2C m6V\nm8\u03bb\n\n\u0013\n\ng2\n=\u2212\nm2 ln\n32\u03c0 2 V\n\n\u0012\n\n(m2V + m2 )4\nm6V (m2V + 2m2 )\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(7.17)\n\nWe assume that |\u03bc| \u226a |m|, to justify using the massless 1/p2 propagator in the loop integral\n\nfor m2Q and AQ , though it's straightforward to generalize the expressions to include the Q masses.\n\n54\n\n\fwhich is always negative, tachyonic; as a function of x \u2261 m2 /m2V , which characterizes\n\nthe relative susy-breaking of the gauge messengers, (7.17) starts at zero for x = 0 (the\nunbroken susy limit), and decreases with x.

It is also easily verified that these satisfy (3.26) in the large p2 limit,\n\nwith susy-breaking parameters given by (3.34), which we have already evaluated in (7.7).\n\nIt is, in principle, straightforward to use the above expressions in our general formulae,\nto compute the sfermion masses and the AQ term. But the required momentum integrals\nare complicated to evaluate, even with a computer, and the resulting expressions would\nnot be very illuminating in any case. So we will just consider the results in the limit where\nX0 \u226b m \u223c gv. In this limit, the supersymmetric contribution to the vector multiplet\n\nmass is much larger than the susy-breaking mass splittings, so the spectrum is approximately supersymmetric.

The SO(N ) \u2192 SO(N \u2212 1) gauge messenger models\nWe again consider the model (7.1), now taking \u03c61 and \u03c62 in the N dimensional\nrepresentation of an SO(N ) gauge symmetry.

This is compatible with (2.2) since\nF\u0304 T A T = 0; again, this is general for O'R models. The G\u2032 = SO(N ) symmetry is broken\nto G = SO(N \u2212 1) by h\u03c61 i =\n6 0, and hF\u03c62 i =\n6 0 implies that there are gauge messengers:\n\nthe broken SO(N )/SO(N \u2212 1) gauge fields have a susy-split spectrum. The unbroken\n\nSO(N \u2212 1) gauge multiplets are massless at tree-level. The SO(N \u2212 1) gauginos get a\n\none-loop mass in the theory with hXi \u2261 X0 6= 0. When we couple this hidden sector\n\nto a visible sector, say a chiral superfield Q in the N of SO(N ), we'll obtain sfermion\n\ncontributions coming from both the unbroken SO(N \u2212 1) gauge fields, and also the broken\ngauge fields.

Example: the Fayet Iliopoulos model\nWe now consider a U (1) gauge theory with hidden sector matter fields \u03a6\u00b1 of charge \u00b11,\n\nand visible sector matter fields Q\u00b1 , of charge \u00b11. The superpotential is W = Whid + Wvis ,\n\nwith Whid = m\u03a6+ \u03a6\u2212 and Wvis = M Q+ Q\u2212 . Clearly, the separation of the fields into\n59\n\n\fhidden and visible sectors is artificial \u2013 they're just two flavors of a whole model \u2013 but\nwe'll nevertheless consider first the hidden sector, and next its effect on the visible sector.\nWe'll consider the model with g 2 \u03be > m2 and M 2 > m2 (where we take \u03be, m, and M to\nbe real and positive for simplicity). The condition g 2 \u03be > m2 ensures that the U (1) gauge\ngroup is Higgsed, resulting in gauge messengers. The condition M 2 > m2 ensures that it's\na hidden sector \u03a6 field, and not a visible sector Q field, which gets an expectation value.\nThe need to take M > m is a peculiarity of this example, making it contrary to the usual\nsetup of heavy hidden sector and light visible sector fields. Also, because the gauge field\nD term is crucial for supersymmetry breaking, we can not reliably analyze this example\nby first setting the gauge coupling to zero.\nFor g 2 \u03be > m2 the vacuum has\nh\u03a6+ i = 0,\n\nh\u03a6\u2212 i = v;\n\nhence\n\nhF\u0304\u03a6+ i = \u2212mv,\n\nhF\u03a6\u2212 i = 0,\n\n(7.40)\n\nwhere the EOM is satisfied for v given by\ng 2 v 2 = g 2 \u03be \u2212 m2 \u2261\n\n1 2\nm\n2 V\n\n(7.41)\n\nwhere we gauge rotate v to be real. The hidden sector contribution to the U (1) gauge\ncurrent gJ = \u03b4\u0393/\u03b4V is J = \u03a6\u0304+ \u03a6+ \u2212 \u03a6\u0304\u2212 \u03a6\u2212 + \u03be.

In discussing the 2-point\ne0 , we need to redefine with supercurrent to have vanishing expectation\nfunctions, such as C\nvalue, J \u2032 = J + hJ i.\n\nThe U (1) gauge group is Higgsed and, since charged matter has a non-zero F-term\n\nin the vacuum (7.40), there are gauge messengers. The J \u2032 current correlation functions\n\ncan be computed using the (3.30), where now there is a D-term contribution in (3.31). As\nnoted after (3.32), the D-term contribution is g-independent, and this is seen explicitly\n\u2212\nfrom (7.42), D\u2212\n= g 2 hJi = \u2212m2 . Using (3.30) then yields for the hidden-sector correlator\n\nfunctions\n\nepole =\ng2C\n0\n\nm2V\n,\np2\n\nepole =\ng2C\n1\n\nm2V\n,\np2\n\ne pole =\ng2C\n1/2\n\nm2V\n,\np2 + m2\n\n(7.43)\n\nepole (p2 )'s pole location is at p2 = 0 thanks to a cancellation between the non-zero\nwhere C\n0\n\nF and D term contributions in (3.31). It follows from the fact that there is an unbroken\n60\n\n\ftree-level U (1)R symmetry under which R(\u03a6+ ) = 2, R(\u03a6\u2212 ) = 0 (it is anomalous, but\npreserved perturbatively) that\ne1/2 = 0.\nB\n\n(7.44)\n\nIn particular, the susy-breaking parameters (3.26) are\n\u03b4m20 = 0,\n\n\u03b4m21/2 =\n\n(F\u03040 , F0 )\n= m2 ,\n(\u03c60 , \u03c60 )\n\nm\u03c7 =\n\n(F\u03040 , \u03c60 )\n= 0.\n(\u03c60 , \u03c60 )\n\n(7.45)\n\nThese do not satisfy the F-term specific relation (3.22), because of the D-term contribution.\nUsing (7.43) in (3.5) etc. yields the vector multiplet propagators, with\np2\n\u22060 (p ) = \u22061 (p ) = 2\n,\np + m2V\n2\n\np2 + m2\n\u22061/2 (p ) = 2\n.\np + m2V + m2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(7.46)\n\nThe poles give the vector multiplet spectrum (which of course can also be obtained by the\nstandard analysis of the tree-level lagrangian in components, as in e.g. [53]): m2C = m2V\n(because \u03b4m20 = 0 in (7.45)) and the two gauginos are degenerate with each other (since\nm\u03c7 = 0), with m2\u03bb1 = m2\u03bb2 = m2V + m2 . The O(g 2 v 2 ) contributions to the masses are\n\nsupersymmetric, and the vector multiplet has StrM 2 = \u22124m2 . (The remaining fields\n\nconsists of the goldstino, the would-be NG boson, and a complex scalar with squared mass\n2m2 , so the entire spectrum has StrM 2 = 0.)\nWe now couple this hidden sector to the visible sector fields Q\u00b1 . At tree-level, the\nfermion components of Q\u00b1 have supersymmetric mass M , and the sfermions have mass-\n\nsquareds M 2 \u00b1 m2 , where the latter includes the tree-level sfermion susy-breaking mass\n(m2Q\u00b1 )(0) = \u00b1m2\n\n(7.47)\n\ncoming from the D-term (7.42). So we need M 2 > m2 if we want hQ\u00b1 i = 0 (this is just the\n\nstatement that it's the lighter of the two U (1) flavors which gets the expectation values\nas in (7.40)). At one-loop, the visible sector sfermion masses are given by (2.4) and (2.7),\nappropriately modifying the 1/p2 in (2.7) to account for the tree-level Q masses (which\nare here not negligible) in the internal propagators in Fig. 1:\n(m2Q\u00b1 )(1)\n\n\u2283g\n\n2\n\nZ\n\nd4 p\n(2\u03c0)4\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\np2\n1\n4(p2 + m2 )\n3\n1\n.\n\u2212 2\n+ 2\np2 + m2V p2 + M 2 \u00b1 m2\np + m2V + m2 p2 + M 2\np + m2V\n(7.48)\n\nSince we use Landau gauge, there is no contribution from diagram D4 in Fig. 1, only from\ndiagram D5, so M doesn't enter in the last term. There is also a one-loop correction to\n61\n\n\fthe tree-level result (7.47), from the running of the FI D-term between the mass scales\n\u221a\n\u221a\nM 2 + m2 and M 2 \u2212 m2 .\n\nWe can consider this model for arbitrary values of the ratio m2V /m2 \u2208 [0, \u221e]. In\n\nthe limit where mV is the largest mass scale in the problem, we can integrate out the\n\nmassive vector. Since it has a nearly susy spectrum in this limit, there is an approximately\nsupersymmetric low-energy effective theory, with F -term susy breaking. (In terms of the\ngauge invariant X = \u03a6+ \u03a6\u2212 , Klow \u2248 \u03be \u22121 X\u0304X \u2212 21 \u03be \u22122 (X\u0304X)2 , Wlow \u2248 mX.)

Conclusions and outlook\nLooking to possible model building applications, we have seen that gauge messengers\nhave some potentially useful, and also potentially problematic, differences from non-gauge\nmessenger models. Some of the useful differences have already been discussed in the\nliterature. Tachyonic two-loop contribution to sfermion m2Q s at the messenger scale sounds\nsuspicious, but need not be fatal if the gaugino masses are sufficiently large to drive the\nRG running of m2Q to positive values at low energy (via the running in (2.20)). (One might\nworry about a stripe phase at short distances; we will not consider this issue further here.)\nThis is what happens in the scenario envisioned in [31], where the extra gauge fields of\nSU (5)GUT are gauge messengers. There the squarks start off with tachyonic 2-loop m2Q s,\nwhich are driven positive in the IR by the gaugino masses. The sleptons, on the other\nhand, start off with non-tachyonic 2-loop m2Q at the messenger scale, which is fortunate\nas their weaker RG running could have been insufficient to drive them positive in the IR.\nThe result is a compressed spectrum of superpartners in the low-energy spectrum, which\ncan alleviate little hierarchy tunings.\n62\n\n\fThese earlier studies, however, did not include the one-loop tachyonic contributions\nto m2Q . The helpful RG running effect from (2.20) is of 2-loop order (since the gaugino masses are 1-loop), which can be insufficient to compensate for an initially tachyonic\none-loop tachyonic contribution to m2Q , even for the squarks. Sleptons also get tachyonic\none-loop m2Q , and can again end up tachyonic in the IR. Fortunately, as we have discussed,\nthe one-loop m2Q contribution can be suppressed, in models analogous to the inverted hier\u221a\narchy [4], where the group is Higgsed at a scale mV \u226b F , by the large expectation value of\nthe goldstino pseudomodulus. The one-loop result, m2Q \u223c \u2212(g 2 /16\u03c0 2 )|\u03bc|6 /m4V , is then po-\n\ntentially small compared with the two-loop RG running effect, m2Q \u223c (g 2 /16\u03c0 2 )2 |\u03bc|4 /m2V ,\n\nand the sfermions could end up non-tachyonic in the IR.\n\nFrom a bottom-up perspective, the bottom line of general gauge mediation [1] is that\nall visible sector soft terms have a fixed dependence in terms of six parameters: the gaugino\nea (0) where a = 3, 2, 1 for SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) (the B\nea (0)\nmasses are given by the three B\n\nare complex, but a hidden sector symmetry, e.g. CP, is imposed to avoid CP violating\nphases), and the sfermion masses are given by three real parameters, denoted in [1] by Aa ,\nwhich we'll here rename (reserving A for A-terms), and define them as\nEa \u2261\n\nZ\n\nd4 p 1\n\u039ea (p2 ),\n(2\u03c0)4 p2\n\n(8.1)\n\nwith Ea = O(ga2 ). With this notation, the general gauge mediation result [1] is\nm2Q\n\n\u2283\n\n3\nX\n\nga2 c2 (rQ ; a)Ea .\n\n(8.2)\n\na=1\n\nBecause the 5 sfermion masses depend on the three parameters Ea , they obey the two sum\nrules Tr m2 U (1)Y = Tr m2Q U (1)B\u2212L = 0 at the messenger scale [1].\nIn BSM theories with additional gauge fields, there are additional contributions to\n(8.2), involving additional parameters, see e.g. [67] for discussion. For example, if the SM\nfields are charged under an additional massive U (1)\u2032 , the sfermion masses are modified\nfrom (8.2) by an additive shift,\n\u03b4m2Q\n\n=\n\n2 2\nqQ\ngnew Enew ,\n\nwhere\n\nEnew \u2261\n\nZ\n\nd4 p 1\n\u039enew (p2 ),\n(2\u03c0)4 p2\n\n(8.3)\n\nwhere q(Q) is the charge of Q under U (1)\u2032 . This is the case whether or not the U (1)\u2032\n2\nis a gauge messenger, the only quantitative difference is the gnew\norder of Enew , and the\n\n63\n\n\ffact that gauge messengers tend to have Enew < 0. The addition of the new parameter\nEnew would violate the above sum rules \u2013 with a single new parameter Enew , one sum rule\nwould remain. Since gauge messenger models involve new BSM gauge fields, they introduce\nadditional parameters like Enew , and thus violate the sum rules of [1]. In examples where\nthe gauge messengers are like the SU (5)GUT /SU (3)\u00d7SU (2)\u00d7U (1) gauge fields, the analog\nof (8.3) is\n\u03b4m2Q = g 2 \u2206c(rQ )Enew .\n\n(8.4)\n\nAs we have discussed, gauge messengers also introduce A-terms already at one-loop\norder, which we'll parameterize in bottom-up fashion as\n2\n\nAQ = g \u2206c(rQ )Anew ,\n\nAnew \u2261 \u22122\n\nZ\n\nd4 p 1 brok 2\n\u03a3\n(p ).\n(2\u03c0)4 p2 new\n\n(8.5)\n\nEach broken gauge group factor having gauge messengers thus introduces an additional\nparameter Anew . These parameters are generally complex, which could introduce problematically large CP violating phases. But the same mechanism which eliminates the phases\nof the gauginos, e.g. CP symmetry in the hidden sector, can ensure that the Anew are real.\nAs we have mentioned, we can also apply our methods to models where the susybreaking sector is coupled to an intermediate messenger sector, by some additional gauge\ninteractions. An example of this is the model of [32], where the SU (2) gauge fields of the\n3-2 model act as gauge messengers to the intermediate sector of the doublets li . (And\nthe one-loop tachyonic masses that we have discussed generally here correspond to the\none-loop, negative StrM 2 found in the example of [32]).\nAcknowledgments:\nThis research was supported in part by UCSD grant DOE-FG03-97ER40546.

For this case, without gauge\nmessengers, b \u2212 b\u2032 = c > 0.\n\nThe literature also treats the gauge messenger case using the above formulae [27,34,35],\n\nassuming that there is a single susy-breaking chiral superfield spurion X. As we'll discuss\nshortly, this latter assumption is generally invalid, and leads to results that are generally\nimprecise/incorrect. In particular, that assumption leads to the standard, but incorrect,\nclaim that m2Q vanishes at one-loop, even in the gauge messenger case. In any event, the\nstandard expression for the one-loop A-term at the messenger scale in the gauge messenger\n\u2032\n\u2032\ncase comes from using (A.21), with \u03b3Q 6= \u03b3Q\n, since c2 (rQ ) 6= c2 (rQ\n), so\n\nF\ng2\n\u2206cQ .\nAQ = 2\n2\n16\u03c0\nM\n\n(A.24)\n\nThe standard expression (A.22) in the case of gauge messengers gives the two-loop sfermion\nmasses at the messenger scale to be\nm\ne 2Q = 2\n\ng4\nF\n\u2032\n(c2 (rQ\n)b\u2032 + c2 (rQ )b \u2212 2c2 (rQ )b\u2032 )\n2\n2\n(16\u03c0 )\nM\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(A.25)\n\nwhich is typically tachyonic [34].\nWe can also consider using these methods to obtain the leading effective potential in\nthe limit where some visible sector pseudomodulus has a large expectation value compared\nwith the susy-breaking scale. The leading order in small |F | one-loop effective potential in\n\nthis limit is well-known from the time of [4], coming from the wavefunction renormalization\nof the tree-level vacuum energy of the hidden sector:\nVef f (|Q|) \u2248\n\nX\ni\n\nZi (|Q|)\u22121 |Fi |2 \u2248\n\nX\n\n(1)\n\n\u2206\u03b3i\n\ni\n\nln |Q||Fi |2 = \u2212\n\ng2 X\n\u2206cQi ln |Q||Fi |2 ,\n8\u03c0 2 i\n(A.26)\n\nwhere the last expression is the one-loop result for the case of gauge messengers, and\n(1)\n\n\u2206\u03b3i\n\nis the change in the anomalous dimension of \u03a6i at the scale |Q| where the gauge\n69\n\n\fgroup is partially Higgsed. The sign of the potential is such that Q has a runaway to\nlarge expectation values, which is how the hierarchy is generated in [4]. Without gauge\nmessengers, the Higgsing pseudomoduli are instead first lifted at two-loops to leading order;\nsee [65] for discussion of how, more generally, gauge messengers lead to pseudomoduli being\nlifted at one-lower loop order than would happen without gauge messengers. The result\n(A.26) suggests that there must be a corresponding O(|F |2 ), one-loop mass term (m2Q )(1)\nfor the Q field near the origin. As we discuss, that is indeed true.\n\nLet us now revisit the above results, correcting the literature by allowing for multiple\nsusy-breaking fields. We'll refer to them all as \u03a6 = \u03c6 + \u03b8 2 F (without writing explicitly\nthe flavor or gauge indices), which plays the role of X above. Generalizing the discussion\nP\nin [27,34], the l loop contribution to ZQ is given by ln ZQ (\u03a6\u0304\u03a6) = l \u03b1l\u22121 Pl (\u03b1 ln(\u03a6\u0304, \u03a6)),\n\nwhere (\u03a6\u0304, \u03a6) is some inner product.
