Stated crudely, it demands\nthe invariance of the theory under the joint action (in any order) of the three discrete symmetries - parity (P), charge conjugation (C) and time reversal (T) and predicts the existence\nof an anti-unitary operator realizing this joint symmetry. In an attempt to obtain the spinstatistics connection, similar to that of Pauli [1], Schwinger [2] assumed some form of PCT\ninvariance. Without considering parity violation, it was noted by Luders [3] that charge\nconjugation and time reversal impose the same restrictions on the theory i.e. if a relativistic\nquantum field theory has space inversion then it must have the product of charge conjugation\nand time reversal as a symmetry. However, it was realized by Pauli [4] that PCT itself is\nalways a symmetry. There are two approaches to prove or check the validity of this theorem:\n(A1) It can be shown that the product of P, C, T taken in any order is same as Strong\nReflection (SR) followed by Hermitian conjugation. By this we imply the following set of\nconditions :\nx \u2192 \u2212x\nO\u03bc1 \u03bc2 .....\u03bcn (x) \u2192 (\u22121)n O\u03bc1 \u03bc2 .....\u03bcn (\u2212x)\n\u03c8(x) \u2192 i\u03b35 \u03c8(\u2212x)\n\u2217\n\nE\u2013mail : nmahajan@mri.ernet.in\n\n1\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere O\u03bc1 \u03bc2 .....\u03bcn (x) denotes a bosonic field carrying n number of tensorial indices. Given\nthese transformation rules, and given the fact that PCT is same as SR followed by hermitian conjugation, it becomes very easy to check whether a given theory (with interactions)\npreserves PCT symmetry.\n(A2) The second approach is to proceed via the axiomatic field theory route [5]. In this\ncase, the whole theory can be reconstructed in terms of the Wightman functions defined as\nthe vacuum expectation values of products of fields (generically denoted as Oi (xi ) without\nworrying about the Lorentz indices)\nW (x1 , x2 , ...., xn ) = h0|O1(x1 )O2 (x2 )....On (xn )|0i\n\n(2)\n\nsatisfying very general conditions.\nThe basis of formulation of a quantum field theory, whether it is the Lagrange formalism or\nthe axiomatic formalism, is a set of axioms. Without going into details of the proofs and\ngeneralities of the axioms, we quickly review the important features and summarise them as\nfollows:\n(Ax1) The states are described by unit rays in a physical Hilbert space and the state space\npossesses relativistic invariance.\n(Ax2) The spectral condition implying that the physical four momenta lie in or on the positive light cone.\n(Ax3) Existence of a unique vacuum.\n(Ax4) Notion of a quantum field and its domain.\n(Ax5) Poincare invariance of the fields i.e. the fields transform in a fixed manner under\nSL(2,C).\n(Ax6) Local commutativity (sometimes also known as micro-causality) implying commutation (or anticommutation for fermions) of any two field components for space-like regions.\n(Ax7) The condition of asymptotic completeness i.e. demanding on physical grounds the\nvalidity of the following relation: H = Hin = Hout , where in and out refer to the incoming\nand outgoing collision states.\nIt can be shown on general grounds that a quantum theory which satisfies all these axioms\nrespects the PCT symmetry and the normal spin-statistics relations. The reason why PCT\nholds a very sacred place in any quantum field theory is that apart from being the outcome of\nvery general features in the theoretical formulation, till date no experiment has found deviations from the consequences of this result, namely equality of mass and life times for particle\nand its anti-particle [6]. In spite of these reasons, this area has attracted a lot of attention\n(for an overview see [7]). It has been realized that the requirement of local commutativity\n(or locality) is too strong a condition and it should suffice to prove the PCT theorem if this\ncondition is relaxed to Weak Local Commutativity (WLC) which, for two fields, reads\nh0|[O1(x), O2 (y)]|0i = 0\n\n(x \u2212 y)2 < 0\n\n(3)\n\nfor any two bosonic operators (and the commutator \u2192 anticommutator for fermions). Therefore in the modified form, the PCT theorem can be stated as the equivalence of weak local\ncommutativity to the existence of a PCT operator satisfying the usual properties and leaving the vacuum invariant. In general WLC implies (modulo a sign factor arising due to and\n2\n\n\fdepending on the number of fermions permuted)\nh0|O1 (x1 )O2 (x2 ).....On (xn )|0i = h0|On(xn )....O2 (x2 )O1 (x1 )|0i\n\n(4)\n\nif the set {xi } is a Jost point meaning thereby that ( i \u03bbi \u03bei )2 < 0 for real \u03bei = xi \u2212 xi+1 and\n\u03bbi being set of real non-negative numbers not all zero.\nP\n\nOur usual notions of the space-time being described by a suitable manifold and the points\non it being labelled by a finite number of real coordinates may not be completely correct\nat smaller and smaller distances (or large enough energies), implying that the assumption\nof space-time being a continuum may not be valid at all scales. If that is true then the\nunderlying theory has an intrinsic length scale involved which is usually associated with the\nPlanck length. In fact, with the aim to circumvent the problem of infinities in quantum field\ntheories, Snyder [8] showed that there exists a Lorentz invariant space-time with a natural\nunit of length. The consequences of such a solution are the modifications in the commutation\nrelations for the operators corresponding to both coordinates and momenta. However, it is\neasily seen that such modifications only show up at extremely large energy/momentum scales\nand the low energy physics is well described by the ordinary quantum theory. Motivated by\nsome recent string theory arguments, the field theory formulation on the noncommutative\nspaces has attracted a lot of attention. For a review of field theories on noncommutative\nspaces and various related issues see [9]. In a noncommutative set up the usual notion\nof coordinates being commutative is given up and the hermitian coordinate operators are\nassumed to satisfy the following commutation relation\n[x\u0302\u03bc , x\u0302\u03bd ] = i\u0398\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u0398\u03bc\u03bd is a real antisymmetric matrix. In the quantum theory, this requirement translates\ninto the fact that the product of operators be replaced by the Weyl-Moyal product (also called\nstar product, denoted by \u2217). For a constant \u0398\u03bc\u03bd this implies that for two operators, the star\nproduct is given by\n\"\n\n!\n\ni\nf (x) \u2217 g(x) = exp \u0398\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03b7 \u03bc \u2202\u03b6 \u03bd f (x + \u03b7)g(x + \u03b6)\n2\n\n#\n\n(6)\n\n\u03b7=\u03b6=0\n\nFrom the very expression it is obvious that theories on such spaces must be highly nonlocal\ndue to the presence of infinite number of derivatives. Also, such theories violate the Lorentz\ninvariance in the sense of \"particle Lorentz invariance\" [7] while the observer Lorentz transformations remain the symmetry of the theory.\nIt is instructive to explore the validity of PCT theorem in a noncommutative theory where\nthe locality is lost from the very beginning. However, it seems natural to assume the validity\nof other axioms. In particular, since we would like the theory to be describing physical situations, axioms Ax1-Ax5 should still hold and this is a reasonable assumption to start with.\nAlso, the requirement of asymptotic completeness can be demanded on physical grounds.\nTherefore, but for the locality condition, other axioms are satisfied and it is thus left to\ncheck whether with this condition not met, can PCT still hold. Using the first approach\n3\n\n\f(A1), the authors of [10] have shown that PCT theorem is valid for any form of noncommutativity.1 In the present note, we would like to follow the other approach (A2) and see\nwhether the same conclusions can be reached by employing Wightman functions.\nIn analogy with the Wightman function defined in the ordinary theory Eq.(2), we define\nthe Wightman function in the noncommutative theory as follows\nW (x1 , x2 , ...., xn ; \u2217) = h0|O1(x1 )O2 (x2 )....On (xn )|0i\u2217\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u2217 refers to the product of fields defined appropriately in the noncommutative theory.\nIn our calculations we will work only with scalar fields. Generalization to fermions or vector\nparticles is straight forward and the basic essence is the same. In the ordinary theory the\ncommutator of two scalar fields vanishes for space-like separations (locality implies weak\nlocal commutativity and thus PCT). This is clearly not the case here. Therefore, the main\ntask is to examine the weak local commutativity condition and see what we get out of it.\nBefore exploring the general n point Wightman function, we take a close look at the two\npoint Wightman function defined as\nWAB (x, y; \u2217) \u2261 h0|\u03c6A (x)\u03c6B (y)|0i\u2217\n\n(8)\n\nand the expectation value of the commutator\nh0|[\u03c6A (x), \u03c6B (y)]\u2217 |0i\n\n(9)\n\nwhere again the subscript \u2217 reminds of the fact that the products involved are the appropriate\nproducts referred to as above. Eq.(9) is nothing but the spectral representation. In the\nordinary field theory it reads (for the same fields ie for A and B to be the same) [14]\nh0|[\u03c6(x), \u03c6(y)]|0i = i\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\ndm\u2032 \u03c3(m\u2032 )\u2206(x \u2212 y; m\u2032)\n\nwhere \u03c3(q 2 ) is related to the spectral density \u03c1(q) in the usual way (\u03c1(q) = \u03c3(q 2 )\u03b8(q 0 )\nbecause of Lorentz invariance and \u03b8(q 0 ) is the step function) and i\u2206(x \u2212 y; m\u2032) is the free\nfield commutator which vanishes outside the light cone. However, due to presence of noncommutativity the symmetry make be more restricted and therefore in the noncommutative\ncase we expect the noncommutative parameter to show up. On general grounds it can be\nargued that the commutator in the noncommutative case should have the following spectral\nrepresentation\nZ \u221e\n2\n2\ndm\u2032 \u03c3(m\u2032 , i\u2202 \u03032 )\u2206(\u03be; m\u2032 )\n(10)\nh0|[\u03c6(x), \u03c6(y)]\u2217|0i = i\n0\n\nwhere \u2202 \u0303\u03bc = \u0398\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd and \u03be = x \u2212 y. Being able to write in this form is the consequence of\ntranslational invariance which is not lost as \u0398 is independent of space-time variables. This\nis same as the result obtained in [15]. Because of the presence of derivatives in Eq.(10) it is\n1\n\nFor noncommutative QED the discrete symmetries and their joint action has been discussed in [11].\nUsing the arguments based on Lorentz violation, the authors of [12] conclude that PCT is preserved in any\nrealistic theory. The C, P and T transformation properties and hermiticity of the Seiberg-Witten maps has\nbeen discussed in [13].\n\n4\n\n\fnot very clear whether the commutator expectation value will vanish outside the light cone\nor not. However, it does vanish outside the light cone and the reason is not hard to see.\nThe derivatives (occurring as \u2202 \u03032 ) act only on \u2206(\u03be; m\u2032 ) and this being a simple function of\nexponentials gives back the same function with multiplicative factors proportional to p\u03032 . For\nthe n-th term we will typically have\n(\u2202 \u03032 )n \u2206(\u03be; m\u2032 ) \u221d (p\u03032 )n \u2206(\u03be; m\u2032 )\n\n(11)\n\nthus still preserving the space-time dependence of \u2206(\u03be; m\u2032 ). The net result of all such terms\ncan be put in a series and we have the final form\n(\u2212ip\u03032 )n\nh0|[\u03c6(x), \u03c6(y)]\u2217|0i \u223c\ni\nn!\nn=0\n\u221e\nX\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n2\n\n2\n\ndm\u2032 \u03c3(m\u2032 )\u2206(\u03be; m\u2032 )\n\n(12)\n\nTherefore, even in the noncommutative case, the right hand side vanishes for \u03be 2 < 0.2 We\ntherefore have the result that WLC holds for the field theory formulated on noncommutative\nspace and therefore this result can be extended to non-identical fields and an arbitrary\nnumber of them. Specifically for the two point Wightman function we thus have the result\nWAB (x, y; \u2217) = WBA (y, x; \u2217) for space-like separation between them. Therefore WLC imples\nWAB (\u03be; \u2217) = WBA (\u2212\u03be; \u2217)\n\nf or\n\n\u03be2 < 0\n\n(13)\n\nWe emphasize again that the symbol \u2217 in the above equations and expressions should be\ninferred on the lines of Eq.(10) and Eq.(12) and should not be confused with the \u2217 appearing in the formal expression of the Moyal product. It is just to represent the quantities in\nnoncommutative field theory and distinguish them from their counterparts in the ordinary\ntheory and all the information related to the fact that we are now dealing with a quantum\ntheory on a noncommutative space is coded in the suitably defined spectral density and\nsimilar objects of interest.\nAlso, if \u03be is space-like then under a Lorentz transformation \u03be \u2192 \u2212\u03be , WAB (\u03be; \u2217) = WAB (\u2212\u03be; \u2217).\nConsider now the following quantity:\nW[AB] (\u03be; \u2217) = WAB (\u03be; \u2217) \u2212 WBA (\u03be; \u2217)\n\n(14)\n\nClearly for space-like \u03be, W[AB] (\u03be; \u2217) vanishes if WLC holds. But the two point Wightman function and the permuted one can both be defined as the boundary values of holomorphic functions in a complex plane. Therefore, the vanishing of W[AB] (\u03be; \u2217) for spacelike \u03be on the real axis implies that W[AB] (\u03be; \u2217) = 0 everywhere. Therefore, we have\nWAB (\u03be; \u2217) = WBA (\u03be; \u2217) which is same as SR in terms of Wightman functions. The same\nanalysis can be extended for fermions where the commutators will be replaced by anticommutators. For the case of n point Wightman function, the steps remain essentially the\n2\n\nIn presenting this argument we have implicitly assumed that the power series has a smooth convergence,\nthereby allowing analytic continuation to the desired domain. However, if this requirement is not met,\nthen the arguments would have to be correspondingly modified to allow for convergence, if possible, in an\nappropriately defined limit.\n\n5\n\n\fsame.\nNoncommutative quatum field theories are afflicted by the phenomenon of UV/IR mixing and related pathologies [16]. The presence of hard divergences due to this effect may\nspoil the very basis of Wightman formalism completely, rendering no or very little scope\nfor operations like analytic continuation and smooth convergence of power series etc. In\norder that the quantum theory makes sense physically, such divergences should not manifest\nthemselves in any form. We assume that some mechanism which by-passes the difficulties\narising due to UV/IR mixing is at play and that UV/IR mixing poses no serious threat to\nthe results obtained. For the present case it is not required and therefore we do not bother\nabout the details of such an underlying mechanism.\nWe briefly comment on the types of noncommutativities and possible difficulties relating\nto them. For space-space noncommutativity, since the star product does not involve time\nderivatives, there are no subtelties involved in handling the time ordered products. Therefore, it is easier to see that the theories with only space-space noncommutativity preserve\nthe gross features and axioms of the quantum theory to a greater extent. It becomes far\nmore complicated and involved if space-time noncommutativity is present. A careful handling of time ordering has to be employed because of the presence of an infinite number of\ntime derivatives which can lead to very complicated and non-compact looking results and\nexpressions. To interpret these results would require further care. Moreover, simplistic and\nnaive treatment should be abandoned in order to obtain sensible results. With time being involved in the noncommutativity, more conceptual issues at the level of foundations\nof quatum theory may creep in and would require a detailed and more careful treatment.\nHowever, for the present case, we tend to ignore all such issues and base our arguments\non the hope that such issues don't hamper the basic axioms of the quantum field theory\nthat we have employed, thereby allowing us to reach the desired conclusions. An important\nthing to remember is the fact that the symmetry is much more restricted in the present\nsituation and depending upon the type of noncommutativity, the theory admits a particular\nsymmetry group and associated structure. Therefore, a careful analysis, keeping track of\nand correctly taking into account the nature and extent of the allowed operations in such a\ncase like analytic continuation etc, should yield these results.\nWe therefore see that by looking at the behaviour of Wightman functions it is clear that\nPCT theorem is valid in quantum field theory defined on noncommutative space, provided\nwe assume the validity of axioms Ax1-Ax5. Nowhere in the whole analysis has any specific\nform of noncommutativity assumed, except for the assumption that \u0398 is independent of\nspace-time variables. As in [10], it remains to be explored in detail whether some specific\nform of noncommutativity leads to violation of spin-statistic relation in context of Wightman\nfunction approach as well. Also, the more conceptual and philosophical issues concerning\nthe time direction being noncommutative have still to be explored and investigated in detail.\nHowever, it is very clear that the results obtained hold without much doubt if we restrict\n\n6\n\n\fourselves to space like noncommutativity.3\nAcknowledgements I would like to thank E.
