Introduction\nWe introduce a new class of finite dimensional gentle algebras, the surface algebras, which includes the hereditary, the tilted, and the cluster-tilted\ne These algebras are conalgebras of Dynkin type A and Euclidean type A.\nstructed from an unpunctured Riemann surface with boundary and marked\npoints by introducing cuts in internal triangles of an arbitrary triangulation\nof the surface.\nTo be more precise, let T be a triangulation of a bordered unpunctured\nRiemann surface S with a set of marked points M , and let (QT , IT ) be the\nbound quiver associated to T as in [16, 3]. The corresponding algebra BT =\nkQT /IT , over an algebraically closed field k, is a finite dimensional gentle\nalgebra [3]. Moreover, BT is the endomorphism algebra of the cluster-tilting\nobject corresponding to T in the generalized cluster category associated to\n(S, M ), see [16, 13, 1, 12]. Each internal triangle in the triangulation T\ncorresponds to an oriented 3-cycle in the quiver QT , and the relations for\nthe algebra BT state precisely that the composition of any two arrows in an\noriented 3-cycle is zero in BT .\nIf the surface is a disc or an annulus then the corresponding cluster algebra, as defined in [20], is acyclic, and, in this case, the algebra BT is clustere if S is an annulus [16, 14]. It\ntilted of type A, if S is a disc; and of type A,\nhas been shown in [4] that every cluster-tilted algebra is the trivial extension\nof a tilted algebra C by the canonical C-bimodule Ext2C (DC, C), where D\ndenotes the standard duality. The quiver of the tilted algebra C contains no\noriented cycle and can be obtained from the quiver of BT by an admissible\ncut, that is, by deleting one arrow in every oriented 3-cycle. Moreover, it\nThe second author was supported by the NSF grant DMS-1001637 and by the University of Connecticut.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nLUCAS DAVID-ROESLER AND RALF SCHIFFLER\n\nhas been shown in [10] that an algebra is iterated tilted of Dynkin type A\nof global dimension at most two if and only if it is the quotient of a clustertilted algebra of the same type by an admissible cut. It is then natural to\nask, what kind of algebras we can get from admissible cuts of algebras BT\ncoming from other surfaces.\nThis motivates the definition of a surface algebra, which is constructed by\ncutting a triangulation T of a surface (S, M ) at internal triangles. Cutting\nan internal triangle 4 means replacing the triangle 4 by a quadrilateral 4\u2020\nwith one side on the boundary of the same surface S with an enlarged set\nof marked points M \u2020 , see Definition 3.1. Cutting as many internal triangles\nas we please, we obtain a partial triangulation T \u2020 of a surface with marked\npoints (S, M \u2020 ), to which we can associate an algebra BT \u2020 = kQT \u2020 /IT \u2020 in a\nvery similar way to the construction of BT from T , see Definition 3.3. This\nalgebra BT \u2020 is called a surface algebra of type (S, M ). A surface algebra is\ncalled an admissible cut if it is obtained by cutting every internal triangle\nexactly once.\nOur first main results are the following.\nTheorem 1. Every surface algebra is isomorphic to the endomorphism algebra of a partial cluster-tilting object in a generalized cluster category. More\nprecisely, if the surface algebra BT \u2020 is given by the cut (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) of the\ntriangulated surface (S, M, T ), then\n\u223c EndC\nB \u2020=\nT \u2020,\nT\n\n(S,M \u2020 )\n\nwhere T \u2020 denotes the object in cluster category C(S,M \u2020 ) corresponding to T \u2020 .\nTheorem 2. If (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) is an admissible cut of (S, M, T ) then\n(a) QT \u2020 is an admissible cut of QT .\n(b) BT \u2020 is of global dimension at most two.\n(c) The tensor algebra of BT \u2020 with respect to the BT \u2020 -bimodule\nExt2B \u2020 (DBT \u2020 , BT \u2020 )\nT\n\nis isomorphic to the algebra BT .\nPart (c) of Theorem 2 implies that the cluster category associated to\nBT \u2020 is the same as the cluster category associated to the surface (S, M ).\nTherefore, the surface algebras BT \u2020 which are admissible cuts are algebras\nof cluster type (S, M ) in the sense of [2]. In [2], the authors study algebras\nof global dimension two whose cluster type is acyclic, which, in our setting,\ncorresponds to admissible cuts from a disc or an annulus.\nApplying the result of [10] mentioned above, we see that the admissible\ncut surface algebras of the disc with n + 3 marked points are precisely the\niterated tilted algebras of type An whose global dimension is at most two.\nFor all surfaces other than the disc, we show that the surface algebras form\nseveral different classes under derived equivalence. For admissible cuts from\nthe annulus, this recovers a result in [2].\n\n\fALGEBRAS FROM SURFACES WITHOUT PUNCTURES\n\n3\n\nTo show that the surface algebras are not always derived equivalent, we\nuse an invariant introduced by Avella-Alaminos and Geiss in [9], which we\ncall the AG-invariant for short. For each surface algebra BT \u2020 , we compute\nthe AG-invariant in terms of the original triangulated surface (S, M, T ) and\nthe number of cuts on each boundary component, see Theorem 4.6. In\nparticular, we show that already for the annulus there are different cuts\ncoming from the same triangulation T such that the corresponding surface\nalgebras have different AG invariants and hence are not derived equivalent.\nWe want to point out here that Ladkani has very recently also computed\nthe AG invariant for the algebras BT (without cuts) in the special case\nwhere each boundary component has exactly one marked point, and used\nit to classify the surfaces (S, M ) such that any two triangulations T1 , T2 of\n(S, M ) give rise to derived equivalent algebras BT1 and BT2 , see [24]. Let us\nalso mention that the AG-invariant has been used by Bobinski and Buan in\n[11] to classify algebras that are derived equivalent to cluster-tilted algebras\ne\nof type A and A.\nWe then study the module categories of the surface algebras. Since surface\nalgebras are gentle, their indecomposable modules are either string modules\nor band modules. In the special case where the surface is not cut, the indecomposable modules and the irreducible morphisms in the module category\nof the algebras BT have been described by Br\u00fcstle and Zhang in [12] in\nterms of the of generalized arcs on the surface (S, M, T ). One of the main\ntools used in [12] is the description of irreducible morphisms between string\nmodules by Butler and Ringel [15]. We generalize the results of Br\u00fcstle and\nZhang to the case of arbitrary surface algebras BT \u2020 , and we describe the\nindecomposable modules in terms of certain permissible generalized arcs in\nthe surface (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) and the irreducible morphisms in terms of pivots of\nthese arcs in the surface. In this way, we construct a combinatorial category\nE \u2020 of permissible generalized arcs in (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) and define a functor\nH : E \u2020 \u2192 mod BT \u2020 .\nThis construction is inspired by the construction of the cluster category of\ntype A as a category of diagonals in a convex polygon by Caldero, Chapoton\nand the second author in [16]. We then show the following theorem.\nTheorem 3.\n(a) The functor H is faithful and induces a dense, faithful functor from E \u2020 to\nthe category of string modules over BT \u2020 . Moreover, H maps irreducible\nmorphisms to irreducible morphisms and commutes with AuslanderReiten translations.\n(b) If the surface S is a disc, then H is an equivalence of categories.\n(c) If the algebra BT \u2020 is of finite representation type, then H is an equivalence of categories.\n\n\f4\n\nLUCAS DAVID-ROESLER AND RALF SCHIFFLER\n\nAs an application of our results, we provide a geometric model for the\nmodule category of any iterated tilted algebra of type A of global dimension\ntwo in terms of permissible diagonals in a partially triangulated polygon.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we recall definitions and\nresults that we need at a later stage. Section 3 is devoted to the definition\nof surface algebras and their fundamental properties. The computation of\nthe AG-invariant is contained in section 4 and, in section 5, we study the\nmodule categories of surface algebras in terms of arcs in the surface. The\napplication to iterated tilted algebras of type A is presented in section 6.\n2. Preliminaries and notation\nIn this section, we recall concepts that we need and fix notations.\n2.1. Gentle algebras, string modules and band modules. Recall from\n[7] that a finite-dimensional algebra B is gentle if it admits a presentation\nB = kQ/I satisfying the following conditions:\n(G1) At each point of Q start at most two arrows and stop at most two\narrows.\n(G2) The ideal I is generated by paths of length 2.\n(G3) For each arrow b there is at most one arrow a and at most one arrow\nc such that ab \u2208 I and bc \u2208 I.\n(G4) For each arrow b there is at most one arrow a and at most one arrow\nc such that ab 6\u2208 I and bc 6\u2208 I.\nAn algebra B = kQ/I where I is generated by paths and (Q, I) satisfies\nthe two conditions (G1) and (G4) is called a string algebra (see [15]), thus\nevery gentle algebra is a string algebra. Butler and Ringel have shown in\n[15] that, for a finite dimensional string algebra, there are two types of\nindecomposable modules, the string modules and the band modules. We\nrecall the definitions here.\nFor any arrow b \u2208 Q1 , we denote by b\u22121 a formal inverse for b, with\ns(b\u22121 ) = t(b), t(b\u22121 ) = s(b), and we set (b\u22121 )\u22121 = b.\nA walk of length n \u2265 1 in Q is a sequence w = a1 * * * an where each ai is\nan arrow or a formal inverse of an arrow and such that t(ai ) = s(ai+1 ), for\nany i \u2208 {1, . . . , n \u2212 1}. The source of the walk w is s(w) = s(a1 ) and the\ntarget of the walk w is t(w) = t(an ). We define a walk ei of length zero for\nany point i \u2208 Q0 such that s(ei ) = t(ei ) = i.\nIf (Q, I) is a bound quiver, a string in (Q, I) is either a walk of length\nzero or a walk w = a1 * * * an of length n \u2265 1 such that ai 6= a\u22121\ni+1 for any\ni \u2208 {1, . . . , n \u2212 1} and such that no walk of the form ai ai+1 * * * at nor its\ninverse belongs to I for 1 \u2264 i and t \u2264 n. A band is a string b = a1 * * * an\nsuch that s(b) = t(b), and any power of b is a string, but b itself is not a\nproper power of a string.\nAny string w gives rise to a string module M (w) over B, whose underlying\nvector space consists of the direct sum of one copy of the field k for each\nvertex in the string w, and the action of an arrow a on M (w) is induced by\n\n\fALGEBRAS FROM SURFACES WITHOUT PUNCTURES\n\n5\n\nthe identity morphism 1 : k \u2192 k between the copies of k at the endpoints of\na, if a or a\u22121 is in w, and zero otherwise. Each band b = a1 a2 * * * an defines\na family of band modules M (b, `, \u03c6), where ` is a positive integer and \u03c6 is an\nautomorphism of k ` . The underlying vector space of M (b, `, \u03c6) is the direct\nsum of one copy of k ` for each vertex in b, and the action of an arrow a is\ninduced by the identity morphism 1 : k ` \u2192 k ` , if a = a1 , a2 , . . . , an\u22121 , by the\nautomorphism \u03c6 if a = an and the action is zero if a is not in w.\n2.2. The AG-invariant. First we recall from [9] the combinatorial definition of the derived invariant of Avella-Alaminos and Geiss. We will refer\nto this as the AG-invariant. Throughout let A be a gentle k-algebra with\nbound quiver (Q, I), Q = (Q0 , Q1 , s, t) where s, t : Q1 \u2192 Q0 are the source\nand target functions on the arrows.\nDefinition 2.1. A permitted path of A is a path C = a1 a2 * * * an which is\nnot in I. We say a permitted path is a non-trivial permitted thread of A if\nfor all arrows b \u2208 Q1 , neither bC or Cb is not a permitted path. These are\nthe 'maximal' permitted paths of A. Dual to this, we define the forbidden\npaths of A to be a sequence F = a1 a2 * * * an such that ai 6= aj unless i = j,\nand ai ai+1 \u2208 I, for i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1. A forbidden path F is a non-trivial\nforbidden thread if for all b \u2208 Q1 , neither bF or F b is a forbidden path. We\nalso require trivial permitted and trivial forbidden threads. Let v \u2208 Q0 such\nthat there is at most one arrow starting at v and at most one arrow ending\nat v. Then the constant path ev is a trivial permitted thread if when there\nare arrows b, c \u2208 Q1 such that s(c) = v = t(b) then bc 6\u2208 I. Similarly, ev\nis a trivial forbidden thread if when there are arrows b, c \u2208 Q1 such that\ns(c) = v = t(b) then bc \u2208 I.\nLet H denote the set of all permitted threads and F denote the set of all\nforbidden threads.\nNotice that each arrow in Q1 , is both a permitted and a forbidden path.\nMoreover, the constant path at each sink and at each source will simultaneously satisfy the definition for a permitted and a forbidden thread because\nthere are no paths going through v.\nWe fix a choice of functions \u03c3, \u03b5 : Q1 \u2192 {\u22121, 1} characterized by the\nfollowing conditions.\n(1) If b1 6= b2 are arrows with s(b1 ) = s(b2 ), then \u03c3(b1 ) = \u2212\u03c3(b2 ).\n(2) If b1 6= b2 are arrows with t(b1 ) = t(b2 ), then \u03b5(b1 ) = \u2212\u03b5(b2 ).\n(3) If b, c are arrows with s(c) = t(b) and bc 6\u2208 I, then \u03c3(c) = \u2212\u03b5(b).\n\nNote that the functions need not be unique. Given a pair \u03c3 and \u03b5, we can\ndefine another pair \u03c3 0 := \u22121\u03c3 and \u03b50 := \u22121\u03b5.\nThese functions naturally extend to paths in Q. Let C = a1 a2 * * * an\u22121 an\nbe a path. Then \u03c3(C) = \u03c3(a1 ) and \u03b5(C) = \u03b5(an ). We can also extend\nthese functions to trivial threads. Let x, y be vertices in Q0 , hx the trivial\npermitted thread at x, and py the trivial forbidden thread at y.

See [9, Theorems A and C].\n\n\fALGEBRAS FROM SURFACES WITHOUT PUNCTURES\n\n7\n\n2.3. Surfaces and triangulations. In this section, we recall a construction of [20] in the case of surfaces without punctures.\nLet S be a connected oriented unpunctured Riemann surface with boundary \u2202S and let M be a non-empty finite subset of the boundary \u2202S. The\nelements of M are called marked points. We will refer to the pair (S, M )\nsimply by unpunctured surface. The orientation of the surface will play a\ncrucial role.\nWe say that two curves in S do not cross if they do not intersect each\nother except that endpoints may coincide.\nDefinition 2.5. An arc \u03b3 in (S, M ) is a curve in S such that\n(a) the endpoints are in M ,\n(b) \u03b3 does not cross itself,\n(c) the relative interior of \u03b3 is disjoint from M and from the boundary\nof S,\n(d) \u03b3 does not cut out a monogon or a digon.\nDefinition 2.6. A generalized arc is a curve in S which satisfies the conditions (a), (c) and (d) of Definition 2.5.\nCurves that connect two marked points and lie entirely on the boundary\nof S without passing through a third marked point are called boundary\nsegments. Hence an arc is a curve between two marked points, which does\nnot intersect itself nor the boundary except possibly at its endpoints and\nwhich is not homotopic to a point or a boundary segment.\nEach generalized arc is considered up to isotopy inside the class of such\ncurves. Moreover, each generalized arc is considered up to orientation, so\nif a generalized arc has endpoints a, b \u2208 M then it can be represented by a\ncurve that runs from a to b, as well as by a curve that runs from b to a.\nFor any two arcs \u03b3, \u03b3 0 in S, let e(\u03b3, \u03b3 0 ) be the minimal number of crossings\nof \u03b3 and \u03b3 0 , that is, e(\u03b3, \u03b3 0 ) is the minimum of the numbers of crossings of\ncurves \u03b1 and \u03b10 , where \u03b1 is isotopic to \u03b3 and \u03b10 is isotopic to \u03b3 0 . Two arcs\n\u03b3, \u03b3 0 are called non-crossing if e(\u03b3, \u03b3 0 ) = 0. A triangulation is a maximal\ncollection of non-crossing arcs. The arcs of a triangulation cut the surface\ninto triangles. Since (S, M ) is an unpunctured surface, the three sides of each\ntriangle are distinct (in contrast to the case of surfaces with punctures). A\ntriangle in T is called an internal triangle if none of its sides is a boundary\nsegment. We often refer to the triple (S, M, T ) as a triangulated surface.\nAny two triangulations of (S, M ) have the same number of elements,\nnamely\nn = 6g + 3b + |M | \u2212 6,\nwhere g is the genus of S, b is the number of boundary components and\n|M | is the number of marked points. The number n is called the rank of\n(S, M ). Moreover, any two triangulations of (S, M ) have the same number\nof triangles, namely\nn \u2212 2(g \u2212 1) \u2212 b.\n\n\f8\n\nLUCAS DAVID-ROESLER AND RALF SCHIFFLER\n\nb\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n3\n\ng\n0\n1\n2\n0\n1\n2\n0\n\n|M |\nn+3\nn\u22123\nn\u22129\nn\nn\u22126\nn \u2212 12\nn\u22123\n\nsurface\ndisc\ntorus with disc removed\ngenus 2 surface with disc removed\nannulus\ntorus with 2 discs removed\ngenus 2 surface with 2 discs removed\npair of pants\n\nTable 2.1.

A triangulation and its quiver\nNote that b > 0 since the set M is not empty. We do not allow n to be\nnegative or zero, so we have to exclude the cases where (S, M ) is a disc\nwith one, two or three marked points. Table 2.1 gives some examples of\nunpunctured surfaces.\n2.4. Jacobian algebras from surfaces. If T = {\u03c41 , \u03c42 , . . . , \u03c4n } is a triangulation of an unpunctured surface (S, M ), we define a quiver QT as follows.\nQT has n vertices, one for each arc in T . We will denote the vertex corresponding to \u03c4i simply by i. The number of arrows from i to j is the number\nof triangles 4 in T such that the arcs \u03c4i , \u03c4j form two sides of 4, with \u03c4j\nfollowing \u03c4i when going around the triangle 4 in the counter-clockwise orientation, see Figure 2.1 for an example. Note that the interior triangles in\nT correspond to oriented 3-cycles in QT .\nIn [20], the authors associate a cluster algebra A(QT ) to this quiver;\nthe cluster algebras obtained in this way are called cluster algebras from\n(unpunctured) surfaces and have been studied in [20, 21, 26, 25, 18], and\nthe corresponding cluster categories in [16, 12].\n\n\fALGEBRAS FROM SURFACES WITHOUT PUNCTURES\n\n9\n\nFollowing [3, 23], let W be the sum of all oriented 3-cycles in QT . Then W\nis a potential, in the sense of [17], which gives rise to to a Jacobian algebra\nBT = Jac(QT , W ), which is defined as the quotient of the path algebra of\nthe quiver QT by the two-sided ideal generated by the subpaths of length\ntwo of each oriented 3-cycle in QT .\nProposition 2.7. BT is a gentle algebra.\nProof. This is shown in [3].\n2.5. Cuts and admissible cuts. Let Q be a quiver. An oriented cycle C\nin Q is called chordless if C is a full subquiver of Q and has the property\nthat for every vertex v in C, there is exactly one arrow in C starting and\none arrow in C ending at v. We define a cut of Q to be a subset of the\nset of arrows of Q with the property that each arrow in the cut lies in an\noriented chordless cycle in Q. Following [19], such a cut is called admissible\nif it contains exactly one arrow of each oriented chordless cycle of Q.\nNow let C = kQ/I be a quotient of the path algebra of Q by an admissible\nideal I. Then an algebra is said to be obtained from C by a cut if it is\nisomorphic to a quotient kQ/hI \u222a \u0393i, where \u0393 is a cut of Q.\nProposition 2.8. Any algebra obtained by a cut from a gentle algebra is\ngentle.\nProof. If a bound quiver satisfies the conditions (G1)\u2013(G4) of the definition\nof a gentle algebra, then deleting an arrow will produce a bound quiver that\nstill satisfies these conditions.\n3. Algebras from surfaces without punctures\nIn this section, we introduce the surface algebras and develop their fundamental properties.\nLet (S, M ) be a surface without punctures, T a triangulation, QT the corresponding quiver, and BT the Jacobian algebra. Throughout this section,\nwe assume that, if S is a disc, then M has at least 5 marked points, thus we\nexclude the disc with 4 marked points. Recall that the oriented 3-cycles in\nthe quiver QT are in bijection with the interior triangles in the triangulation\nT.\n3.1. Cuts of triangulated surfaces. We want to define a geometric object\nwhich corresponds to cuts of the quiver QT , and, to that purpose, we modify\nthe set M to a new set of marked points M \u2020 , and we modify the triangulation\nT to a partial triangulation T \u2020 of the surface (S, M \u2020 ).1\nWe need some terminology. Each arc has two ends defined by trisecting\nthe arc and deleting the middle piece. If 4 is a triangle with sides \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3,\nthen the six ends of the three sides can be matched into three pairs such\nthat each pair forms one of the angles of the triangle 4.\n1We use the dagger symbol \u2020 to indicate the cut.\n\n\f10\n\nLUCAS DAVID-ROESLER AND RALF SCHIFFLER\n\n\u03b40\n\n\u03b4 00\n\nv\n\u1fb1\n\n4\n\nv 00\n\n\u03b1\u2020\n\n\u03b2\u2020\n\n\u03b2\u0304\n\u03c7v,\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\nv0\n\n\u03b2\n\n4\u2020\n\nFigure 3.1. A local cut at v relative to \u03b1, \u03b2. The internal\ntriangle 4 in T becomes a quasi-triangle 4\u2020 in T \u2020 .\nLet 4 be an internal triangle of T and let v \u2208 M be one of its vertices.\nLet \u03b4 0 and \u03b4 00 be two curves on the boundary, both starting at v but going\nin opposite directions, and denote by v 0 and v 00 there respective endpoints.\nMoreover, choose \u03b4 0 , \u03b4 00 short enough such that v 0 and v 00 are not in M , and\nno point of M other that v lies on the curves \u03b4 0 , \u03b4 00 . We can think of v 0 , v 00\nbeing obtained by moving the point v a small amount in either direction\nalong the boundary, see Figure 3.1 for an example.

If \u03b3\u0304 is an end of an arc \u03b3 \u2208 T such that \u03b3\u0304 is incident to v, let \u03b3\u0304 0\nbe a curve in the interior of S homotopic to\n(\nthe concatenation of \u03b3\u0304 and \u03b4 0 , if \u1fb1 lies between \u03b3\u0304 and \u03b2\u0304, or \u03b3\u0304 = \u1fb1;\nthe concatenation of \u03b3\u0304 and \u03b4 00 , if \u03b2\u0304 lies between \u03b3\u0304 and \u1fb1, or \u03b3\u0304 = \u03b2\u0304.\nThen let \u03c7v,\u03b1,\u03b2 (\u03b3) be the arc obtained from \u03b3 by replacing the end \u03b3\u0304 by\n\u03b3\u0304 0 . If both ends of \u03b3 are incident to v then \u03c7v,\u03b1,\u03b2 (\u03b3) is obtained from \u03b3 by\nreplacing both ends with the appropriate new end; this is the case in the\nexample in Figure 3.2. If \u03b3 6= \u03b1, \u03b2 then, abusing notation, we will denote the\narc \u03c7v,\u03b1,\u03b2 (\u03b3) again by \u03b3. The arcs obtained from \u03b1 and \u03b2 will be denoted\nby \u03b1\u2020 = \u03c7v,\u03b1,\u03b2 (\u03b1) and \u03b2 \u2020 = \u03c7v,\u03b1,\u03b2 (\u03b2), see Figure 3.1. Define\n\u03c7v,\u03b1,\u03b2 (T ) = (T \\ {\u03b3 \u2208 T | \u03b3 incident to v}) \u222a {\u03c7v,\u03b1,\u03b2 (\u03b3) | \u03b3 incident to v}.\n\nFinally, let \u03c7v,\u03b1,\u03b2 (S, M, T ) = (S, \u03c7v,\u2206 (M ), \u03c7v,\u03b1,\u03b2 (T )).

Part (a). The oriented 3-cycles in QT are precisely the chordless\ncycles in QT and, by Lemma 3.4, QT \u2020 is obtained from QT by deleting\nexactly one arrow in each chordless cycles; this shows (a).\nPart (b). Since QT \u2020 does not contain any oriented cycles, the ideal IT \u2020\nis generated by monomial relations which do not overlap. This immediately\nimplies gl. dim BT \u2020 \u2264 2.\nIf BT \u2020 is of global dimension at most one, then the ideal IT \u2020 is trivial and\nhence the ideal IT is trivial too. It follows that QT has no oriented cycles,\nT \u2020 = T , BT \u2020 = BT , and that T is a triangulation without internal triangles.\nThe only unpunctured surfaces that admit such a triangulation are the disc\nand the annulus, corresponding to the case where BT \u2020 is hereditary algebra\ne respectively.\nof type A or A,\ng\nPart (c).

The admissible cut surface algebras of the disc with n + 3\nmarked points are precisely the iterated tilted algebras of type An whose global\ndimension is at most two.\nProof. In [10], the authors have shown that the quotients by an admissible\ncut of a cluster-tilted algebra of type An are precisely the iterated tilted algebras of type An of global dimension at most two. By [16], the cluster-tilted\nalgebras of type An are precisely the algebras BT , where T is a triangulation of the disc with n + 3 marked points. The result now follows from\nTheorem 3.5.\nTheorem 3.7. Every surface algebra is isomorphic to the endomorphism\nalgebra of a partial cluster tilting object in a generalized cluster category.\nMore precisely, if the surface algebra BT \u2020 is given by the cut (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) of\nthe triangulated surface (S, M, T ), then\nBT \u2020 \u223c\n= EndC(S,M \u2020 ) T \u2020 ,\n\n\f14\n\nLUCAS DAVID-ROESLER AND RALF SCHIFFLER\n\nwhere T \u2020 denotes the object in the generalized cluster category C(S, M \u2020 )\ncorresponding to T \u2020 .\n\u2020\n\nProof. Let T be the completion of T \u2020 as in the construction of the quiver\n\u2020\nQT \u2020 . By [20], the triangulation T corresponds to a cluster in the cluster\n\u2020\nalgebra of (S, M \u2020 ), hence T also corresponds to a cluster-tilting object in\nthe generalized cluster category C(S, M \u2020 ), see [1, 12]. Thus T \u2020 is a partial\n\u2020\ncluster-tilting object in C(S, M \u2020 ). The endomorphism algebra EndC(S,M \u2020 ) T\n\u2020\n\nof the cluster-tilting object T is isomorphic to the Jacobian algebra BT \u2020 .\nLet \u03c7vi ,\u03b1i ,\u03b2i be one of the local cuts that defines the cut (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ). In\nthe quiver QT \u2020 , we have the corresponding subquiver\n\u03b1i\u2020\n\n\u03b3i\n\n\u03b5i\n\u03b2i\u2020\n\nand there are no other arrows in QT \u2020 starting or ending at \u03b5i . Each vertex in\nthis subquiver corresponds to an indecomposable summand of the cluster\u2020\ntilting object T , and each non-zero path corresponds to a non-zero morphism between the indecomposable summands associated to the endpoints\nof the path. Thus in C(S, M \u2020 ), there are non-zero morphisms f : \u03b2i\u2020 \u2192 \u03b3i ,\ng : \u03b3i \u2192 \u03b5i , hi : \u03b5i \u2192 \u03b2i , ui : \u03b5i \u2192 \u03b1i\u2020 , and the compositions gi fi , hi gi , fi hi\nare zero, but the composition ui gi is non-zero.\n\u2020\nRemoving the summand \u03b5i from the cluster-tilting object T and consider\u2020\ning EndC(S,M \u2020 ) (T \\\u03b5i ), the only non-zero morphisms between the summands\n\u03b1i\u2020 , \u03b2i\u2020 , and \u03b3i are fi and ui gi , and the composition (ui gi )fi is zero, since\n\u2020\ngi fi is zero. Thus, locally, the quiver of EndC(S,M \u2020 ) (T \\ \u03b5i ) is \u03b1i\u2020 \u2192 \u03b3i \u2192 \u03b2i\u2020\n\u2020\n\nand the composition of the two arrows is zero in EndC(S,M \u2020 ) (T \\ \u03b5i ).\nThe endomorphism algebra EndC(S,M \u2020 ) (T \u2020 ) of the partial cluster tilting\nobject T \u2020 is obtained by a finite number of such local transformations, each\nof which is corresponding to a local cut \u03c7vi ,\u03b1i ,\u03b2i . Thus EndC(S,M ) (T \u2020 ) =\nkQT \u2020 /IT \u2020 = BT \u2020 .\nTheorem 3.8. Every surface algebra is gentle.\nProof. Let BT \u2020 be the surface algebra obtained by a cut (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) of a\ntriangulated surface (S, M, T ). The algebra BT is gentle by Proposition 2.7,\nand the result then follows from Lemma 3.4 and Proposition 2.8.\n\n\fALGEBRAS FROM SURFACES WITHOUT PUNCTURES\n\nv0\n\u03c41\n\u03c42\n\nv\n\n15\n\nv 00\n\u03c4j\n\nFigure 4.1. The fan at v\n4. Computing the AG-invariant of surface algebras\nIn this section, we give an explicit formula for the AG-invariant of an\narbitrary surface algebra in terms of the surface. The key idea is to interpret the permitted threads as complete fans and the forbidden threads as\ntriangles or quasi-triangles in the partial triangulation T \u2020 .\n4.1. Permitted threads and complete fans. Let (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) be a cut\nof a triangulated unpunctured surface (S, M, T ), and let v be a point in\nM \u2020 . Let v 0 , v 00 be two points on the boundary, but not in M \u2020 , such that\nthere is a curve \u03b4 on the boundary from v 0 to v 00 passing through v, but\nnot passing through any other point of M \u2020 . Let \u03b3 be a curve from v 0 to\nv 00 which is homotopic to \u03b4 but disjoint from the boundary except for its\nendpoints, such that the number of crossings between \u03b3 and T \u2020 is minimal.\nThe sequence of arcs \u03c41 , \u03c42 , . . . \u03c4j in T \u2020 that \u03b3 crosses in order is called the\ncomplete fan at v in T \u2020 . The arcs \u03c42 , . . . , \u03c4j\u22121 are called the interior arcs of\nthe fan and j is called the width of the fan. See Figure 4.1\nNote that the sequence is of width zero if no arc in T \u2020 is incident to v.\nFans of width zero are called empty fans, and fans of width one are called\ntrivial fans. Every arc in T \u2020 is contained in exactly two non-empty complete\nfans, namely the two fans at the two endpoints of the arc.\nLemma 4.1. The construction of QT \u2020 induces a bijection between the set H\nof permitted threads in QT \u2020 and the non-empty complete fans of (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ).\nMoreover, under this bijection, the trivial permitted threads correspond to the\ntrivial fans.\nProof. From the construction of QT \u2020 it follows that the non-trivial permitted\nthreads of QT \u2020 correspond to the complete fans in (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) of width at\nleast 2.\nNow consider a trivial permitted thread; this corresponds to a vertex\nx \u2208 QT \u2020 with at most one arrow starting at x and at most one arrow ending\nat x. By the construction of QT \u2020 , the vertex x corresponds to an arc in T \u2020 ,\nand this arc is contained in exactly two complete fans, one at each endpoint\nof the arc. If both fans are non-trivial, then this configuration generates\neither two arrows ending at the vertex x in QT \u2020 or two arrows starting at\nthe vertex x, which contradicts our assumption that x corresponds to a\ntrivial permitted thread. Hence one of the two fans must be trivial.\n\n\f16\n\nLUCAS DAVID-ROESLER AND RALF SCHIFFLER\n\nSince we are excluding the case where (S, M ) is a disc with four marked\npoints, it follows from the construction of T \u2020 , that it is impossible that\nboth fans at the endpoint of an arc are trivial. This shows that the trivial\npermitted threads are in bijection with the trivial complete fans.\n4.2. Forbidden threads, triangles and quasi-triangles.\nLemma 4.2. The construction of QT \u2020 induces a bijection between the set of\nforbidden threads of length at most two of QT \u2020 and the set of non-internal\ntriangles and quasi-triangles in T \u2020 . Moreover, under this bijection\n(a) forbidden threads of length two correspond to quasi-triangles,\n(b) forbidden threads of length one correspond to triangles with exactly one\nside on the boundary,\n(c) forbidden threads of length zero correspond to triangles with exactly two\nsides on the boundary.\nRemark 4.3. (a) Each internal triangle in T \u2020 gives rise to three forbidden\nthreads of length three.\n(b) There are no forbidden threads in QT \u2020 of length greater than three.\n(c) If T \u2020 = T then there are no forbidden threads of length two.\nProof. Forbidden threads of length two can only occur at the local cuts,\nsince all relations in BT occur in oriented 3-cycles, and hence give forbidden\nthreads of length three. Thus the forbidden threads of length two are precisely the paths \u03b1i\u2020 \u2192 \u03b3i \u2192 \u03b2i\u2020 in QT \u2020 which were obtained from the 3-cycles\n\u03b1i \u2192 \u03b3i \u2192 \u03b2i \u2192 \u03b1i by the cuts \u03c7vi ,\u03b1i ,\u03b2i . These paths correspond to the\nquasi-triangle 4\u2020i . This shows (a).\nA forbidden thread of length one in QT \u2020 is an arrow x \u2192 y which does not\nappear in any relation, which means that the arcs corresponding to x and\ny in the triangulation T \u2020 bound a triangle which is not an internal triangle\nand also not a quasi-triangle and which has two interior sides (corresponding\nto x and y). This shows (b).\nFinally, a trivial forbidden thread in QT \u2020 is a vertex x that is either a sink\nwith only one arrow ending at x, or a source with only one arrow starting at\nx, or the middle vertex of a zero relation of length two and the two arrows\nfrom this zero relation are the only two arrows at x. If x is such a source\nor sink, then it follows from the construction of QT \u2020 that the triangle on\none side of the arc corresponding to x in T \u2020 must not generate an arrow\nin QT \u2020 . Thus x is a side of a triangle that has two sides on the boundary.\nOn the other hand, if x is such a middle vertex of a zero relation, then the\ntriangle on one of side of the arc corresponding to x in T \u2020 must be an internal\ntriangle or a quasi-triangle. On the other side, we must have a triangle with\ntwo sides on the boundary, since there are no further arrows at x.\nConversely, given any triangle with two sides on the boundary and the\nthird side \u03b3 corresponding to a vertex x \u2208 QT \u2020 , we can deduce that x is a\ntrivial forbidden thread, because, on the other side of \u03b3, we have either a\n\n\fALGEBRAS FROM SURFACES WITHOUT PUNCTURES\n\n4F x\n\n4F\n\nx\n\nv\u03c6(F ) v\u03c6(F )\n\n17\n\n4F\n\nx\nv\u03c6(F )\n\nFigure 4.2.

AG-invariant. We now want to compute the AG-invariant of BT \u2020 in\nterms of the partially triangulated surface (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ). To do so, we need\nto describe how to go from a forbidden thread to a the following permitted\nthread and from a permitted thread to the following forbidden thread as in\nthe AG-algorithm.\nLemma 4.4. Let F \u2208 F be a forbidden thread in QT \u2020 , and let x = s(F )\nbe its starting vertex in QT \u2020 . Then there exists a unique permitted thread\n\u03c6(F ) \u2208 H such that s(\u03c6(F )) = x and \u03c3(\u03c6(F )) = \u2212\u03c3(F ). Moreover, the\nmarked point v\u03c6(F ) of the complete fan of \u03c6(F ) is the unique vertex of 4F\nthat is the starting point of the arc corresponding to x in T \u2020 , with respect to\nthe counterclockwise orientation of 4F , see Figure 4.2.\nProof. The existence and uniqueness of \u03c6(F ) follows already from [9], but\nwe include a proof here, for convenience. If F is a trivial forbidden thread,\nthen there is at most one arrow start at x, hence there is a unique permitted\nthread \u03c6(F ) starting at x. By Lemma 4.1, \u03c6(F ) corresponds to a complete\nfan in which the first arc corresponds to x. It follows that the vertex of this\nfan is the one described in the Lemma.\nNow suppose that F is not trivial, and let \u03b1 be its initial arrow. Then\nthere are two permitted threads starting at x, one of which has also \u03b1 as\ninitial arrow. However, since \u03c3(F ) = \u03c3(\u03b1), the condition \u03c3(\u03c6(F )) = \u2212\u03c3(F )\nexcludes the possibility that \u03c6(F ) starts with \u03b1; thus \u03c6(F ) is the other\npermitted thread starting at x. Again using Lemma 4.1, we see that \u03c6(F )\ncorresponds to the complete fan whose vertex is the marked point v\u03c6(F )\n\n\f18\n\nLUCAS DAVID-ROESLER AND RALF SCHIFFLER\n\nvH\n\nvH\ny\n\nFan(vH )\n\ny\n\nFan(vH )\n\n4\u03c8(H)\n\n4\u03c8(H)\n\nFigure 4.3.\ndescribed in the Lemma. Note that if \u03b1 is the only arrow starting at x, then\n\u03c6(F ) trivial.\nLemma 4.5. Let H \u2208 H be a permitted thread in QT \u2020 and let y = t(H)\nbe its terminal vertex in QT \u2020 . Then there exists a unique forbidden thread\n\u03c8(H) \u2208 F such that t(\u03c8(H)) = y and \u03b5(\u03c8(H)) = \u2212\u03b5(H). Moreover, the\ntriangle or quasi-triangle 4\u03c8(H) of \u03c8(H) is the unique triangle or quasitriangle which is adjacent to the arc corresponding to y and incident to vH ,\nsee Figure 4.3.\nProof. Again, the existence and uniqueness already follows from [9], but we\ninclude a proof here too. It follows from Lemma 4.1 that the side of the\ntriangle 4\u03c8(H) which is following y in the counterclockwise order must be a\nboundary segment, since the fan at vH is a complete fan and y = t(H). It\nfollows from Lemma 4.2 that the forbidden thread corresponding to 4\u03c8(H)\nends in y. Let b be the terminal arrow in H. If 4\u03c8(H) has two sides on the\nboundary, then \u03c8(H) is a trivial forbidden thread and \u03b5(\u03c8(H)) = \u2212\u03b5(b) =\n\u2212\u03b5(H). Note that in this case, b is the only arrow in QT \u2020 ending at y, and,\nsince \u03b5(b) = \u03b5(H), it follows that \u03c8(H) is unique.\nSuppose now that 4\u03c8(H) has only one side on the boundary. Since this\nboundary segment follows y in the counterclockwise orientation, 4\u03c8(H)\ninduces an arrow b0 in QT \u2020 , with t(b0 ) = y, and this arrow is the terminal arrow of \u03c8(H). Since b and b0 end at the same vertex, we have\n\u03b5(\u03c8(H)) = \u03b5(b0 ) = \u2212\u03b5(b) = \u2212\u03b5(H). This shows the existence of \u03c8(H), and\nits uniqueness follows as above.\nWe are now able to prove the main result of this section, the computation\nof the AG-invariant for an arbitrary surface algebra.\nFor any triangulated surface (S, M, T ) and any boundary component C\nof S, denote by MC,T the set of marked points on C that are incident to at\nleast one arc in T . Let n(C, T ) be the cardinality of MC,T , and let m(C, T )\nbe the number of boundary segments on C that have both endpoints in\nMC,T .\n\n\fALGEBRAS FROM SURFACES WITHOUT PUNCTURES\n\n19\n\nTheorem 4.6. Let B = BT \u2020 be a surface algebra of type (S, M, T ) given\nby a cut (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ). Then the AG-invariant AG(B) can be computed as\nfollows:\n(a) The ordered pairs (0, 3) in AG(B) are in bijection with the internal\ntriangles in T \u2020 , and there are no ordered pairs (0, m) with m 6= 3.\n(b) The ordered pairs (n, m) in AG(B) with n 6= 0 are in bijection with the\nboundary components of S. Moreover, if C is a boundary component,\nthen the corresponding ordered pair (n, m) is given by\nn = n(C, T ) + `,\n\nm = m(C, T ) + 2`,\n\nwhere ` is the number of local cuts \u03c7v,\u03b1,\u03b2 in (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) such that v is a\npoint on C.\nProof. Part (a) follows directly from the construction of BT \u2020 . To show (b),\nlet\n(H0 , F0 , H1 , F1 , . . . , Hn\u22121 , Fn\u22121 , Hn = H0 )\nbe a sequence obtained by the AG-algorithm. Thus each Hi is a permitted\nthread in QT \u2020 , each Fi is a forbidden thread, Fi = \u03c8(Hi ), and Hi+1 =\n\u03c6(Fi ), where \u03c6 and \u03c8 are the maps described in the Lemmas 4.4 and 4.5\nrespectively.\nBy Lemma 4.1, each permitted thread Hi corresponds to a non-empty\ncomplete fan, thus to a marked point vHi in M \u2020 . On the other hand,\nLemma 4.2 implies that each forbidden thread Fi corresponds to a triangle or quasi-triangle 4Fi in T \u2020 .\nLet C be the boundary component containing vH0 . Lemma 4.5 implies\nthat 4F0 contains a boundary segment incident to vH0 , and it follows then\nfrom Lemma 4.4 that vH1 \u2208 M \u2020 is a marked point on the same boundary\ncomponent C. Note that if F0 is a non-trivial forbidden thread then vH0\nand vH1 are the two endpoints of the unique boundary segment in 4F0 , and,\nif F0 is a trivial forbidden thread, the 4F0 is a triangle with two sides on\nthe boundary and vH0 , vH1 are the two endpoints of the side of 4F0 that is\nnot on the boundary.\nRecursively, we see that each of the marked points vHi \u2208 M \u2020 lies on the\nboundary component C and that the set of points {vH0 , vH1 , . . . , vHn\u22121 } is\nprecisely the set of marked points in M \u2020 that lie on C and that are incident\nto at least one arc in T \u2020 . In particular, n = n(C, T ) + `.\nRecall that the number m in the ordered pair (n, m) is equal to the sum of\nthe number of arrows appearing in the forbidden threads F0 , F1 , . . . , Fn\u22121 .\nFor each i, the number of arrows in Fi is zero if 4Fi has two sides on the\nboundary component C; it is one if 4Fi is a triangle with one side on C;\nand it is two if 4Fi is a quasi-triangle with one side on C. Taking the sum,\nwe see that m is the number of triangles in T \u2020 that have exactly one side on\nC plus twice the number of quasi-triangle in T \u2020 that have exactly one side\non C. Thus m is equal to the number of boundary segments in (S, M, T )\n\n\f20\n\nLUCAS DAVID-ROESLER AND RALF SCHIFFLER\n\non C that have both endpoints in MC,T plus twice the number of local cuts\n\u03c7v,\u03b1,\u03b2 with v a marked point in C.\nRemark 4.7. The theorem holds for arbitrary cuts of (S, M, T ), thus, in\nparticular, it computes the AG-invariant of the Jacobian algebra BT corresponding to the uncut triangulated surface (S, M, T ).\nCorollary 4.8. Any admissible cut surface algebra of the disc with n + 3\nmarked points is derived equivalent to the path algebra A of the quiver\na\n\na\n\na\n\nan\u22122\n\nan\u22121\n\n1\n2\n3\n1 \u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2192 2 \u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2192 3 \u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 n \u2212 1 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 n\n\nProof. This statement already follows from Corollary 3.6, since tilting induces an equivalence of derived categories. We give here an alternative proof\nusing Theorem 4.6. The algebra A has AG-invariant (n + 1, n \u2212 1), since in\nthe AG algorithm we get the sequence\nH0 = a1 a2 * * * an\u22121\nH1 = e n\nH2 = en\u22121\n..\n.\n\nF0 = en\nF1 = an\u22121\nF2 = an\u22122\n..\n.\n\nHn = e 1\nHn+1 = H0\n\nFn = e1\n\nwhich contains n + 1 permissible threads and n \u2212 1 arrows in the forbidden\nthreads.\nOn the other hand, Theorem 4.6 implies that the AG-invariant of an\nadmissible cut surface algebra BT \u2020 of the disc is given by\n(n(C, T ) + ` , m(C, T ) + 2`).\nIt follows from an easy induction that the number of internal triangles in\nT is equal to n + 1 \u2212 n(C, T ). Since the cut is admissible, this is also the\nnumber of local cuts. Thus\nn(C, T ) + ` = n + 1.\nMoreover, m(C, T ) is equal to the number of boundary segments minus\n2(n + 3 \u2212 n(C, T )), thus m(C, T ) = 2n(C, T ) \u2212 n \u2212 3, and it follows that\nm(C, T ) + 2` = n \u2212 1.\n\nAlternatively, since there is only one ordered pair (n, m) in the AG-invariant,\nthe number m is the number of arrows in the quiver, which is equal to n \u2212 1,\nsince the quiver of an admissible cut from the disc with n + 3 marked points\nis a tree on n vertices.\nThus the AG-invariant of BT \u2020 is equal to the AG-invariant of A. Since\nthe quivers of both algebras have no cycles, now the result follows from\nTheorem 2.4.\nRemark 4.9. It also follows from Theorem 4.6 that for surfaces other than\nthe disc, the surface algebras obtained by admissible cuts of a fixed triangulation are in general not all derived equivalent.\n\n\fALGEBRAS FROM SURFACES WITHOUT PUNCTURES\n\n21\n\n4.4. Surface algebras of annulus type. We make some observations for\nsurface algebras coming from admissible cuts of a triangulated annulus.\nCorollary 4.10. Let S be an annulus, and let B1 , B2 be surface algebras\nof type (S, M, T ) obtained by two admissible cuts of the same triangulation.\nThen\n(a) B1 and B2 are derived equivalent if and only if B1 and B2 have the same\nAG-invariant.\n(b) If on each boundary component the number of local cuts is the same in\nthe two admissible cuts then B1 and B2 are derived equivalent.\nProof. (a) The quivers of B1 and B2 have exactly one cycle, since they are\nadmissible cuts of the annulus. Thus Theorem 2.4 implies that AG(B1 ) =\nAG(B2 ) if and only if B1 and B2 are derived equivalent.\n(b) Theorem 4.6 shows that AG(B1 ) = AG(B2 ) if the number of local cuts\non any given boundary component is the same in both admissible cuts.\nRemark 4.11. In [2], the authors associate a weight to each of the algebras\nappearing in Corollary 4.10 and show that two such algebras are derived\nequivalent if and only if they have the same weight (respectively the same\nabsolute weight if the marked points are equally distributed over the two\nboundary components).\nExample 4.12. We end this section with an example coming from an annulus. Let (S, M, T ) be the triangulated surface given in Figure 4.4 and B\ne 4 with the following quiver\nthe corresponding cluster-tilted algebra of type A\n1\n\n5\n3\n\n2\n\n4\n\nApplying Theorem 4.6, we see that AG(B) is given by the ordered pairs\n{(0, 3), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 1)} where (1, 0) is associated to the inner boundary\ncomponent and (2, 1) the outer boundary component. If we consider only\nadmissible cuts, then the AG-invariant of the resulting algebras will be given\nby only two ordered pairs, one per boundary component. In Figures 4.5\u2013\n4.7 we list the bound quivers given by the different possible admissible cuts\ngrouped by their AG-invariant. We use dashed lines to represent the zero\nrelations induced by the cuts. There are two internal triangles, hence there\nare nine distinct admissible cuts. If we make sure to cut both boundary\ncomponents, we will get five algebras having the AG-invariant given by\n{(2, 2), (3, 3)}. It follows from [9, Section 7] and Theorem 2.4, that these\ne 4 . The other four admissible cuts of\nare iterated tilted algebras of type A\n(S, M, T ) split into two AG-classes: {(1, 0), (4, 5)}, corresponding to cutting\nthe outer boundary component twice, and {(3, 4), (2, 1)} cutting the inner\nboundary component twice.

A geometric description of the module categories of\nsurface algebras\nIn this section, we study the module categories of surface algebras. Let\n(S, M, T ) be a triangulated surface without punctures and let (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 )\nbe a cut of (S, M, T ) with corresponding surface algebra BT \u2020 . We will\nassociate a category E \u2020 to (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) whose objects are given in terms of\ncurves on the surface (S, M \u2020 ), and we will show that there is a functor from\nE \u2020 to mod BT \u2020 is faithful and dense in the category of string modules over\nBT \u2020 . Consequently, the string modules over the surface algebra BT \u2020 have a\ngeometric description in terms of certain curves on (S, M \u2020 ).\nIn the special case where S is a disc, or more generally if BT \u2020 is representation finite, we even have that E \u2020 and BT \u2020 are equivalent categories.\nWe will use this fact in Section 6 to give a geometric description of tilted\nalgebras of type A and their module categories.\n5.1. Permissible arcs.\nDefinition 5.1.\n(a) A curve \u03b3 in (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) is said to consecutively cross \u03c41 , \u03c42 \u2208 T \u2020 if \u03b3\ncrosses \u03c41 and \u03c42 in the points p1 and p2 , and the segment of \u03b3 between\nthe points p1 and p2 does not cross any other arc in T \u2020 .\n(b) A generalized arc or closed curve in (S, M \u2020 ) is called permissible if it is\nnot consecutively crossing two non-adjacent sides of a quasi-triangle in\nT \u2020.\n(c) Two permissible generalized arcs \u03b3, \u03b3 0 in (S, M \u2020 ) are called equivalent if\nthere is a side \u03b4 of a quasi-triangle 4\u2020 in T \u2020 such that\n(i) \u03b3 is homotopic to the concatenation of \u03b3 0 and \u03b4,\n(ii) both \u03b3 and \u03b3 0 start at an endpoint of \u03b4 and their first crossing with\nT \u2020 is with the side of 4\u2020 that is opposite to \u03b4.\nExamples of a non-permissible arc and of equivalent arcs are given in Figure 5.1.\nNote that the arcs in T \u2020 are permissible by definition. Furthermore, note\nthat the side \u03b4 in part (c) of the definition may be, but does not have to be,\na boundary segment.\n\n\f24\n\nLUCAS DAVID-ROESLER AND RALF SCHIFFLER\n\n\u03b4\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b3\n4\u2020\n\n\u03b30\n4\u2020\n\nFigure 5.1. Example of a non-permissible arc \u03b3 on the left,\nand of two equivalent arcs \u03b3, \u03b3 0 on the right\n5.2. Pivots.\nDefinition 5.2. Let \u03b3 be a permissible generalized arc, and let v and w\nbe its endpoints. Let fv \u03b3 be the permissible generalized arc or boundary\nsegment obtained from \u03b3 by fixing the endpoint v and moving the endpoint\nw as follows:\n(i) if w is a vertex of a quasi-triangle 4\u2020 and w0 is the counterclockwise\nneighbor vertex of w in 4\u2020 such that \u03b3 is equivalent to an arc \u03b3 0 with\nendpoints v, w0 then move w to the counterclockwise neighbor of w0\non the boundary of S. Thus fv \u03b3 is given by a curve homotopic to the\nconcatenation of \u03b3 0 and the boundary segment that connects w0 to its\ncounterclockwise neighbor.\n(ii) otherwise, move w to its counterclockwise neighbor on the boundary.\nThus fv \u03b3 is given by a curve homotopic to the concatenation of \u03b3\nand the boundary segment that connects w to its counterclockwise\nneighbor.\nWe call fv \u03b3 the pivot of \u03b3 fixing v.\nRemark 5.3. In the special case of a trivial cut, that is (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) =\n(S, M, T ), the pivots are defined by condition (ii) only, since there are no\nquasi-triangles. In this case our pivots are the same as in [12], where it has\nbeen show that these pivots correspond to irreducible morphisms in mod BT .\nDefinition 5.4. Let \u03b3 be a permissible generalized arc in (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) and\nlet v and w be its endpoints. Let \u03c4 \u2212 \u03b3 be the permissible generalized arc\ngiven by \u03c4 \u2212 \u03b3 = fv fw \u03b3. Dually, let \u03c4 + \u03b3 be the permissible generalized arc\nin (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) such that \u03c4 \u2212 (\u03c4 + \u03b3) = \u03b3.\nRemark 5.5. Again, in the case where (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) = (S, M, T ), it has been\nshow in [12] that \u03c4 + and \u03c4 \u2212 correspond to the Auslander-Reiten translation\nand the inverse Auslander-Reiten translation in mod BT , respectively.\n5.3. The categories E \u2020 and E.\n\n\fALGEBRAS FROM SURFACES WITHOUT PUNCTURES\n\n25\n\nDefinition 5.6. Let E \u2020 = E(S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) be the additive category whose\nindecomposable objects are the equivalence classes of permissible arcs in\n(S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) that are not in T \u2020 and whose morphisms between indecomposable objects are generated by the pivots fv \u2208 HomE \u2020 (\u03b3, fv \u03b3) subject to the\nrelations fv fw = fw fv . Here we use the convention that fv \u03b3 denotes the\nzero object in E \u2020 whenever fv \u03b3 is a boundary segment in (S, M \u2020 ) or an arc\nin T \u2020 .\nOur first goal is to relate the category E \u2020 = E(S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) to the category E = E(S, M, T ) of the original triangulated surface, by constructing\na functor G : E \u2020 \u2192 E. Let \u03b3 be an indecomposable object in E \u2020 ; thus \u03b3\nis represented by a permissible generalized arc in (S, M \u2020 ). The generalized\narc \u03b3 is determined by the sequence of its crossing points with T \u2020 together\nwith the sequence of its segments between consecutive crossing points. Each\nof these segments lies entirely in a triangle or quasi-triangle of T \u2020 . Define\nG(\u03b3) to be the unique generalized arc in (S, M ) determined by the same\nsequence of crossing points and segments, with the difference that segments\nof \u03b3 that were lying on a quasi-triangle become segments of G(\u03b3) which lie\nin the corresponding triangle.\nIf fv : \u03b3 \u2192 fv \u03b3 is a morphism in E \u2020 given by a pivot of type (ii) in\nDefinition 5.2, then let G(fv ) : G(\u03b3) \u2192 G(fv \u03b3) be the pivot in E fixing the\nmarked point corresponding to v in M . If fv : \u03b3 \u2192 fv \u03b3 is given by a pivot\nof type (i) in Definition 5.2, then let G(fv ) : G(\u03b3) \u2192 G(fv \u03b3) be the minimal\nsequence of pivots in E, each pivot fixing the marked point corresponding\nto v in M , which transforms G(\u03b3) into G(fv \u03b3).\nProposition 5.7. G is a full and faithful functor.\nProof. The image of a composition of pivots under G is equal to the composition of the images of the pivots. Moreover, if v \u2020 , w\u2020 are marked points in M \u2020\nand v, w are the corresponding points in M , then G(fv\u2020 ) \u25e6 G(fw\u2020 )(G(\u03b3)) =\nG(fw\u2020 ) \u25e6 G(fv\u2020 )(G(\u03b3)), which shows that G respects the relations on E \u2020 .\nTo show that G is full, let \u03b3, \u03b3 0 be indecomposable objects in E \u2020 and let\nf \u2208 HomE (G(\u03b3), G(\u03b3 0 )) be a nonzero morphism in E. Then f is given by a\nsequence of pivots f = fvi \u25e6 fvi\u22121 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 fv1 with v1 , * * * , vi \u2208 M . Using the\nrelations fv fw = fw fv in E, we may suppose without loss of generality that\nv1 = v2 = * * * = vh 6= vh+1 = * * * = vi\u22121 = vi , for some h with 1 \u2264 h \u2264 i. If\nall intermediate generalized arcs fvj \u25e6 fvj\u22121 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 fv1 (G(\u03b3)) are in the image\nof G, then there is a corresponding sequence of pivots fv\u2020 \u25e6 fv\u2020 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 fv\u2020\nin E \u2020 such that G(fv\u2020 \u25e6 fv\u2020\ni\n\ni\u22121\n\ni\n\ni\u22121\n\n1\n\n\u25e6 * * * \u25e6 fv\u2020 (\u03b3)) = fvi \u25e6 fvi\u22121 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 fv1 (G(\u03b3)).\n1\n\nOtherwise, let \u03b1 = fvj \u25e6fvj\u22121 \u25e6* * *\u25e6fv1 (G(\u03b3)) be the first generalized arc in this\nsequence that does not lie in the image of G. Then \u03b1 must cross an internal\ntriangle 4 in T such that the corresponding (non-permissible) generalized\narc \u03b1\u2020 in (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) crosses the corresponding quasi-triangle in two opposite\nsides consecutively. Let \u03b4 = fvj\u22121 \u25e6 fvj\u22122 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 fv1 (G(\u03b3)) be the immediate\npredecessor of \u03b1 in the sequence, and let \u03b2 = fvk \u25e6 fvk\u22121 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 fv1 (G(\u03b3)) with\n\n\f26\n\nLUCAS DAVID-ROESLER AND RALF SCHIFFLER\n\nk > j be the first arc after \u03b1 in the sequence which is again in the image of\nG. We distinguish two cases.\n(1) Suppose that vj = vj+1 = * * * = vk . Thus \u03b2 and \u03b1 are both incident\nto vj , and it follows that in E \u2020 , we have fv\u2020 \u03b4 \u2020 = \u03b2 \u2020 , where \u03b4 \u2020 = fv\u2020 \u25e6\nj\n\nfv\u2020\n\nj\u22122\n\nj\u22121\n\n\u25e6 * * * \u25e6 fv\u2020 (\u03b3) in E \u2020 is the object corresponding to \u03b4, and \u03b2 \u2020 the\n1\n\nobject in E \u2020 corresponding to \u03b2. Clearly,\nG(fv\u2020 \u25e6 fv\u2020\nj\n\nj\u22121\n\n\u25e6 * * * \u25e6 fv\u2020 (\u03b3)) = G(\u03b2 \u2020 ) = \u03b2.\n1\n\nBy induction on the number of generalized arcs in the sequence fvi \u25e6\nfvi\u22121 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 fv1 (G(\u03b3)) which are not in the image of G, it follows now\nthat the morphism f is in the image of G.\n(2) Suppose that vj 6= vk . Then the triangle 4 separates the two arcs G(\u03b3)\nand \u03b2, which implies that none of the arcs in T can cross both G(\u03b3) and\n\u03b2. Therefore HomE (G(\u03b3), \u03b2) = 0, hence f = 0.\nThis shows that G is full.\nTo prove that G is faithful, it suffices to show that G is faithful on pivots\n\u03b3 7\u2192 fv \u03b3. For pivots of type (ii) in Definition 5.2, this is clear, so let \u03b3 7\u2192 fv \u03b3\nbe a pivot of type (i). Recall that such a pivot occurs if \u03b3 is a permissible\ngeneralized arc in (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) with endpoint v, w \u2208 M \u2020 , where w is a vertex\nof a quasi-triangle 4\u2020 in T \u2020 such that \u03b3 is equivalent to a permissible generalized arc \u03b3 0 with endpoints v, w0 , where w0 is the counterclockwise neighbor\nof w in 4\u2020 . Since \u03b3 and \u03b3 0 are equivalent, they define the same object of\nE \u2020 , so the morphism \u03b3 7\u2192 fv \u03b3 can be represented by the pivot \u03b3 0 7\u2192 fv \u03b3 0\nwhich is of type (ii). This shows that the image of this morphism under G\nis non-zero, hence G is faithful.\n5.4. Geometric description of module categories. It has been shown\nin [12] that there exists a faithful functor F : E \u2192 mod BT which sends pivots\nto irreducible morphisms and \u03c4 \u2212 to the inverse Auslander-Reiten translation\nin mod BT . This functor induces a dense and faithful as functor from E to\nthe category of BT -string modules.\nThe composition F \u25e6 G is a faithful functor from E \u2020 to mod BT \u2020 . We\nwill now define another functor res : mod BT \u2192 mod BT \u2020 and get a functor\nH = res \u25e6 F \u25e6 G : E \u2020 \u2192 mod BT \u2020 completing the following commutative\ndiagram.\nE\u2020\n\nG\n\nF\n\nH\nmod BT \u2020\n\nE\n\nres\n\nmod BT\n\n\fALGEBRAS FROM SURFACES WITHOUT PUNCTURES\n\n27\n\nNote that the inclusion map i : BT \u2020 \u2192 BT is an algebra homomorphism\nwhich sends 1BT \u2020 to 1BT . Thus BT \u2020 is a subalgebra of BT , and we can define\nres to be the functor given by the restriction of scalars.\nOn the other hand, BT \u2020 is the quotient of BT by the two-sided ideal\ngenerated by the arrows in the cut. Denoting the projection homomorphism\nby \u03c0 : BT \u2192 BT \u2020 , we see that \u03c0 \u25e6 i is the identity morphism on BT \u2020 . The\nextension of scalars functor \u03b9 = \u2212 \u2297BT \u2020 BT : mod BT \u2020 \u2192 mod BT is sending\nBT \u2020 -modules M to BT -modules \u03b9(M ) = M with the arrows in the cut acting\ntrivially; and \u03b9 is the identity on morphisms. We have res \u25e6 \u03b9 = 1BT \u2020 .\nTheorem 5.8. Let H = res \u25e6 F \u25e6 G : E \u2020 \u2192 mod BT \u2020 .\n(a) The functor H is faithful and induces a dense, faithful functor from E \u2020\nto the category of string modules over BT \u2020 .\n(b) If fv : \u03b3 \u2192 fv \u03b3 is a pivot in E \u2020 then H(fv ) : H(\u03b3) \u2192 H(fv \u03b3) is an\nirreducible morphism in mod BT \u2020 .\n(c) The inverse Auslander-Reiten translate of H(\u03b3) is H(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b3), and the\nAuslander-Reiten translate of H(\u03b3) is H(\u03c4 + \u03b3).\n(d) If \u03b3 \u2208 T \u2020 then H(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b3) is an indecomposable projective BT \u2020 -module and\nH(\u03c4 + \u03b3) is an indecomposable injective BT \u2020 -module.\n(e) If the surface S is a disc, then H is an equivalence of categories.\n(f) If the algebra BT \u2020 is of finite representation type, then H is an equivalence of categories.\nProof. Part (a). The restriction of scalars functor is a faithful functor. The\nfact that F is faithful has been shown in [12], and G is faithful by Proposition 5.7. Thus H is faithful.\nIt also follows from [12] that BT -modules in the image of F are string\nmodules and that F is a dense and faithful functor from E to the category\nof string BT -modules. Consequently, the BT \u2020 -modules in the image of H\nare string modules. Now let M be any indecomposable string module over\nBT \u2020 , then \u03b9(M ) is a string module in mod BT , and hence there exists an\nindecomposable \u03b3 \u2208 E such that F (\u03b3) \u223c\n= \u03b9(M ). Since the arrows in the cut\nact trivially on \u03b9(M ), the generalized arc \u03b3 in (S, M, T ) lifts to a permissible\ngeneralized arc \u03b3 \u2020 in (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ). Moreover H(\u03b3 \u2020 ) = res \u25e6 F (\u03b3) \u223c\n= M . Thus\nH is dense to the category of string BT \u2020 -modules.\nPart (b). It has been shown in [15] that the irreducible morphisms starting\nat an indecomposable string module M (w) can be described by adding hooks\nor deleting cohooks at the endpoints of the string w. If w is a string such that\nthere exists an arrow a such that aw is a string, then let va be the maximal\nnon-zero path starting at s(a) whose initial arrow is different from a. Then\nthere is an irreducible morphism M (w) \u2192 M (wh ), where wh = va\u22121 aw is\nobtained from w by adding the \"hook\" va\u22121 a at the starting point of w. On\nthe other hand, if w is a string such that there is no arrow a such that aw\nis a string, then there are two possibilities:\n\n\f28\n\nLUCAS DAVID-ROESLER AND RALF SCHIFFLER\n\n(1) either w contains no inverse arrow, in which case there is no irreducible morphism corresponding to the starting point of w,\n(2) or w is of the form w = ua a\u22121 wc , where a is an arrow and ua\nis maximal nonzero path ending at t(a). In this case, there is an\nirreducible morphism M (w) \u2192 M (wc ) and wc is said to be obtained\nby deleting the \"cohook\" ua a\u22121 at the starting point of the string\nw.\nIn a similar way, there are irreducible morphisms associated to adding a\nhook or deleting a cohook at the terminal point of the string w.\nThe inverse Auslander-Reiten translation of the string module M (w) corresponds to the string obtained from w by performing the two operations\nof adding a hook, respectively deleting a cohook, at both endpoints of the\nstring w.\nBr\u00fcstle and Zhang have shown that for the Jacobian algebra BT of a\ntriangulated unpunctured surface (S, M, T ), the irreducible morphisms between indecomposable string modules are precisely given by the pivots of\nthe generalized arcs. Adapting their construction to cuts, we show now that\nthe same is true for surface algebras.\nLet \u03b3 \u2020 be a generalized permissible arc in (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) which is not in T \u2020 ,\nlet v \u2020 and w\u2020 be the endpoints of \u03b3 \u2020 and consider the pivot fv\u2020 \u03b3 \u2020 . Applying\nthe functor H, we obtain a homomorphism between BT \u2020 -string modules\nH(fv\u2020 ) : H(\u03b3 \u2020 ) \u2212\u2192 H(fv\u2020 \u03b3 \u2020 ),\nand we must show that this morphism is irreducible. Clearly, if the image\nunder the extension of scalars functor \u03b9H(fv\u2020 ) is an irreducible morphism\nin mod BT , then H(fv\u2020 ) is an irreducible morphism in mod BT \u2020 . By [12],\nthis is precisely the case when \u03b9H(fv\u2020 \u03b3 \u2020 ) = F (fv \u03b3), where fv is the pivot in\n(S, M, T ) at the vertex v corresponding to the vertex v \u2020 , and \u03b3 = G(\u03b3 \u2020 ).\nThus we must show the result in the case where \u03b9H(fv\u2020 \u03b3 \u2020 ) 6= F (fv \u03b3). In\nthis case, we have that fv \u03b3 consecutively crosses two sides \u03b1, \u03b2 of a triangle\n4 in T , which corresponds to a quasi-triangle 4\u2020 in T \u2020 in which the sides\n\u03b1, \u03b2 give rise to two opposite sides \u03b1\u2020 , \u03b2 \u2020 , and w is a common endpoint of \u03b1\nand \u03b2, which gives rise to two points w0 and w00 in 4\u2020 , see Figure 5.2. Now in\nthis situation, fv\u2020 \u03b3 \u2020 is obtained from \u03b3 by moving the endpoint w0 along the\nboundary segment of the quasi-triangle 4\u2020 to the point w00 . The generalized\narc fv\u2020 \u03b3 \u2020 crossed every arc in T \u2020 that is crossed by \u03b3 \u2020 and, in addition, fv\u2020 \u03b3 \u2020\nalso crosses every arc in T \u2020 that is in the complete fan \u03b21 , \u03b22 , . . . , \u03b2j = \u03b2 \u2020\nat w\u2020 . It particular, its last crossing is with the arc \u03b2 \u2020 . On the level of the\nstring modules, this corresponds to obtaining the string modules H(fv\u2020 \u03b3 \u2020 )\nby adding the hook \u2022 \u2190 \u03b21 \u2192 \u03b22 \u2192 * * * \u2192 \u03b2 \u2020 to the string module H(\u03b3 \u2020 ).\nThus the morphism H(fv\u2020 ) is irreducible.\nPart (c). This follows directly from (b) and from the description of the\nAuslander-Reiten translation for string modules in [15].\n\n\fALGEBRAS FROM SURFACES WITHOUT PUNCTURES\n\n29\n\nu\u2020\nu\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\u2020\nfv \u03b3\n4\u2020\n\n4\n\u03b3\n\nv\n\nw\n\nfv\u2020 \u03b3 \u2020\n\n\u03b2\u2020\n\u03b3\u2020\n\nw00\n\nw0\n\nv\u2020\n\nFigure 5.2.

In particular, all BT -modules, and therefore\nall BT \u2020 -modules, are string modules, which shows that H : E \u2020 \u2192 mod BT is\ndense.\nIt remains to show that H is full. Let \u03b3, \u03b3 0 be indecomposable objects\nin E \u2020 and let f \u2208 HomBT \u2020 (H(\u03b3), H(\u03b3 0 )). Applying the functor \u03b9 yields\n\u03b9(f ) \u2208 HomBT (\u03b9 \u25e6 H(\u03b3), \u03b9 \u25e6 H(\u03b3 0 )). Since \u03b3 and \u03b3 0 are objects in E \u2020 , their\nimages under F \u25e6 G are BT -modules on which the arrows in the cut act\ntrivially. Thus, applying \u03b9 \u25e6 res to F \u25e6 G(\u03b3) and F \u25e6 G(\u03b3 0 ) gives back F \u25e6 G(\u03b3)\nand F \u25e6 G(\u03b3 0 ), hence \u03b9 \u25e6 H(\u03b3) = F \u25e6 G(\u03b3) and \u03b9 \u25e6 H(\u03b3 0 ) = F \u25e6 G(\u03b3 0 ).\nSince the composition F \u25e6 G is full, it follows that there exists a morphism\nf \u2020 \u2208 HomE \u2020 (\u03b3, \u03b3 0 ) such that F \u25e6 G(f \u2020 ) = \u03b9(f ). Applying res now yields\nH(f \u2020 ) = f . Thus H is full.\nPart (f). If BT \u2020 is of finite representation type, then all BT \u2020 -modules are\nstring modules. Indeed, a band module would give rise to infinitely many\nisoclasses of indecomposable band modules. Thus H is dense by part (a).\nSince BT \u2020 is of finite representation type it follows that the Auslander-Reiten\nquiver of BT \u2020 has only one connected component and that each morphism\nbetween indecomposable BT \u2020 -modules is given as a composition of finitely\nmany irreducible morphisms. It follows from part (b) that H is full.\n\n\f30\n\nLUCAS DAVID-ROESLER AND RALF SCHIFFLER\n\nRemark 5.9. Since BT \u2020 is a string algebra, it has two types of indecomposable modules: string modules and band modules, see [15]. The theorem\nshows that the string modules are given by the equivalence classes of permissible generalized arcs.\nThe band modules can be parameterized by triples (\u03b3, `, \u03c6) where \u03b3 is\na permissible closed curve corresponding to a generator of the fundamental group of S, ` is a positive integer, and \u03c6 is an automorphism of k ` .\nThe Auslander-Reiten structure for band modules is very simple: the irreducible morphisms are of the form M (\u03b3, `, \u03c6) \u2192 M (\u03b3, ` + 1, \u03c6) and, if ` > 1,\nM (\u03b3, `, \u03c6) \u2192 M (\u03b3, ` \u2212 1, \u03c6); whereas the Auslander-Reiten translation is the\nidentity \u03c4 M (\u03b3, `, \u03c6) = M (\u03b3, `, \u03c6).\n5.5. Finite representation type.\nCorollary 5.10. The surface algebra BT \u2020 is of finite representation type if\nand only if no simple closed non-contractible curve in (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) is permissible.\nProof. Every permissible non-contractible closed curve defines infinitely many\nindecomposable band modules. Conversely, if no simple non-contractible\nclosed curve is permissible, then BT \u2020 has no band modules. It follows that\nBT \u2020 is of finite representation type.\nCorollary 5.11.\n(a) If S is a disc, then BT \u2020 is of finite representation type.\n(b) If S is an annulus, then BT \u2020 is of finite representation type if and only\nif there is a quasi-triangle in T \u2020 with two vertices on one boundary component and two vertices on the other boundary component.\nProof. Part (a). If S is a disc, then there are no simple closed non-contractible\ncurves in S, and the result follows from Corollary 5.10.\nPart (b). The fundamental group of S is generated by a closed curve \u03b3\nthat goes around the inner boundary component exactly once. This curve\n\u03b3 is permissible precisely when it does not cross two opposite sides of a\nquasi-triangle in T \u2020 , and this is precisely the case if there is there is no\nquasi-triangle with two vertices on the interior boundary component and\ntwo vertices on the exterior boundary component.\nExample 5.12. Let (S, M, T ) and (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) be as in Figure 5.3. By\nCorollary 5.11, BT \u2020 is of finite representation type. The Auslander-Reiten\nquiver is given in Figure 5.4, where modules are given by their Loewy series\nin the upper picture and by the corresponding generalized permissible arc\non the surface in the lower picture.\n6. A geometric description of iterated tilted algebras of\ntype An of global dimension at most 2\nIn this section, we apply the results in section 3 to obtain a description\nof the admissible cut surface algebras of type (S, M, T ) where S is a disc.\n\n\fALGEBRAS FROM SURFACES WITHOUT PUNCTURES\n\n1\n3\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2\n4\n\n(S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 )\n\n(S, M, T )\n\nQT : 1\n\n31\n\n3\n\nQT \u2020 : 1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFigure 5.3. An admissible cut of the annulus whose corresponding surface algebra is of finite representation type\nIn this case, the Jacobian algebra BT is a cluster-tilted algebra of type A\nand BT \u2020 is a quotient of BT by an admissible cut. It has been show in [10]\nthat the algebras BT \u2020 obtained in this way are precisely the iterated tilted\nalgebras of type A of global dimension at most two.\nProposition 6.1. Every iterated tilted algebra C of type An of global dimension at most two is isomorphic to the endomorphism algebra of a partial\ncluster-tilting object in the cluster category of type An+` , where ` is the number of relations in a minimal system of relations for C.\nProof. Let (S, M \u2020 , T \u2020 ) be the admissible cut corresponding to C. Then\nC\u223c\n= EndC(S,M \u2020 ) (T \u2020 ) and (S, M \u2020 ) is a disc with n + ` marked points.\nExample 6.2. Let C be the tilted algebra given by the bound quiver\n1\n2\n3\n4 . Then we have n = 4 and ` = 1, so C is the endomorphism algebra of a partial cluster-tilting object in the cluster category\nof type A5 . By [16] this category can be seen as the category of diagonals in an octagon, and the partial cluster-tilting object corresponds to the\nfollowing partial triangulation.\n\n3\n\n1\n\n4\n\n2\n\n\f32\n\nLUCAS DAVID-ROESLER AND RALF SCHIFFLER\n4\n2\n1\n\n1\n3\n\n1 4\n3 2\n1\n\n3\n4\n3 2\n1\n\n2\n1\n\n1\n\n4\n2\n\n1 4\n3 2\n\n4\n3 2\n\n2\n\n4\n1 4\n3\n\n4\n3\n\n1\n\nFigure 5.4.
