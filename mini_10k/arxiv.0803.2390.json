The persistent\nspin current is the intrinsic one which is connected with the Berry phases in the configuration\nspaces of an electron system and winding numbers in the field configurations of electrons. When\nthe topological space of the configuration of a system has the nontrivial first homotopy groups,\nthe persistent spin currents in the system could be nonzero and not easily destroyed by impurity\nscattering in ballistic limit. The non-vanishing background spin currents in infinite two-dimensional\nelectron system found by Rashba could be realized by the transport persistent spin currents in\na finite torus electron system with spin-orbit interaction. In this sense, we meet the challenge\nproposed by Rashba.\nPACS numbers: 73.23.Ra, 71.70.Ej, 72.25.-b\n\n1\n\n\fIntrinsic spin current (SC) could be generated in two-dimensional electron system (2DES)\nwith spin-orbital interaction (SOI) by universal intrinsic spin Hall effect (SHE)[1]. It is connected to the Berry phase in the momentum space of the 2DES and winding numbers\n(WNs) of the spin-orbit field[2]. The experimental observations of SHE in 2DES have been\nreported[3]. However, whether the electron SHE is intrinsic or not is still under debate\nbecause the intrinsic SCs would be destroyed by impurity scattering even in the ballistic\nregime[4]. Besides, the existence of intrinsic SCs faces a challenge proposed by Rashba[5].\nHe found that there are nonzero intrinsic SCs in an infinite 2DES with SOI in the thermodynamic equilibrium. In his opinion, the background SCs are the non-transport ones and\nshould be eliminated in calculating the transport SC by modifying the definition of the SC.\nAfter his work, many subsequent studies have discussed the definition of the SC[6]. There\nis not a satisfied explanation yet.\nThe standard Hamiltonian of 2DES with Rashba SOI is given by\n1\nH = p2 \u2212 \u03bb~\u03c3 * (\u1e91 \u00d7 p~),\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the Rashba coupling constant, ~\u03c3 is the Pauli matrices and \u1e91 is the unit vector\nperpendicular to the confinement plane. For notational simplicity the electron effective mass\nm and ~ are set to unity . The Rashba SOI, which is linear momentum-dependent, provides\nan effective gauge potential \u039b = \u03bb\u01ebij3 , an analog to the electromagnetic vector potential\nA, where \u01ebij3 is the antisymmetric tensor of which the third subscript correspond to the \u1e91\ndirection. There is a coupling of the spin current js and the effective gauge potential \u039b which\nwould induce the Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect, one of realizations of the Berry phase in the\npresence of SOI[7, 8]. It was found about two decades ago that the persistent SCs could\nbe caused by the AC effect in the absence of external magnetic flux in mesoscopic rings[8,\n9]. Recently, it was predicted that a persistent SC could be realized in the nonmagnetic\nsemiconductor ring[10].\nIn this letter, we study the relationship between the persistent SCs and the topological\nproperties of the configurations of systems in one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional\n(2D) mesoscopic electron systems with SOI in thermodynamic equilibrium at absolute zero\ntemperature. The existence, a main property, of the persistence SCs could be gained without\nsolving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nUsually the exact analytical results can be obtained in 1D systems where the topological\n2\n\n\fproperties would be easily explored. We first consider a mesoscopic ring fabricated from\na 2DES system with Rashba interaction in which only the lowest transverse eigenstate is\npopulated. The ring system could be treated as a strictly one-dimensional electron system\n(1DES). For notational simplicity, the radius of the ring R is set to unity. The Hamiltonian\nof the system is\nH =\u2212\n\n\u2202\n1 \u22022\n+ i\u03bb\u03c3r ,\n2\n2 \u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03b8\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the \u03c3r = ~\u03c3 * r\u0302 is the Pauli matrix in radial direction. The periodic boundary condition\nis \u03c8(0) = \u03c8(2\u03c0). There is a circular spin-polarized current in the ring, see Fig. 1.\n\ny\nz\n\nx\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic diagram for the circular movement (labeled by blue arrows) of polarized spin\n(labeled by red arrows) in a ring.\n\nTo explore the relationship between the persistent SC and the topology of ring configuration, we formulate the system in the language of the Euclidean path integral[11, 12]. The\nquantum partition function (QPF) is\nZ 2\u03c0\nZ =\nd\u03b8 < \u03b8|e\u2212\u03b2H |\u03b8 >\n0\nZ 2\u03c0 Z\nZ\n=\nd\u03b8\nD\u03b8(\u03c4 )exp[\u2212\n0\n\nwhere \u03b2 =\n\n1\nkT\n\n\u03b8(\u03b2)=\u03b8(0)\n\n(3)\n\u03b2\n\nd\u03c4 L(\u03b8, \u03b8\u0307)],\n0\n\nand the image time Lagrangian is given by\n1\n1\nL(\u03b8, \u03b8\u0307) = \u03b8\u0307 \u2212 i\u03c3r \u03bb\u03b8\u0307 + \u03bb2 .\n2\n2\n\n(4)\n\nThe trace implies that path \u03b8(\u03c4 ) must start and finish at the same point. The periodic\ncondition accommodate the invariance of the field configuration \u03b8 under translation by 2\u03c0.\nThe QPF can be cast in the form\n3\n\n\fZ=\n\nXZ\n\u03c3\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\nd\u03b8\n\n\u221e Z\nX\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\n2\u03c0in\u03c3\u03bb\n\ne\n\nD\u03b8(\u03c4 )exp[\u2212\n\n\u03b8(\u03b2)=\u03b8(0)+2\u03c0n\n\nZ\n\n\u03b2\n0\n\nX n=\u221e\nX\n1 2\n1\n1\ne\u2212\u03b2( 2 n \u2212n\u03c3\u03bb) ,\nd\u03c4 ( \u03b8\u03072 + \u03bb2 )] =\n2\n2\n\u03c3 n=\u2212\u221e\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c3 = \u00b11 is the eigenvalue of \u03c3r and n, a winding number (WN) of field\nconfiguration[13], is the number of times \u03b8(\u03c4 ) winds around the unit ring as image time\n\u03c4 progresses from 0 to \u03b2. The periodic boundary condition makes the field configuration\n\u03b8(\u03c4 ) a covering map R \u2192 S 1 from the interval [0, \u03b2] into a circle. The map is classified by\nthe first homotopy group \u03c01 of the topological space S 1 of the ring. The group \u03c01 (S1 ) is\nisomorphic to Z where the elements are called the WNs[14, 15, 16].\nOne can get the spectrum of system\n1\n\u01ebn,\u00b1 = n2 \u2213 n\u03bb,\n2\n\nn \u2208 Z.\n\n(6)\n\nAccording to the conventional definition of the SC, the expectation value of the persistent\nSC given by every eigenstate is\n1\n1 \u2202\u01ebn,\u00b1\ns\njn,\u00b1\n=< \u03c8n,\u00b1 | {\u03c3r , v}|\u03c8n,\u00b1 >=\n.\n(7)\n4\n2 \u2202n\nP s\nThe total persistent SC in the ring is j s =\njn,\u00b1 , where the summation should be performed\nover all N eigenstates under the Fermi energy. The total persistent SC of the ring is a\n\nsawtooth function of \u03bb, plotted in Fig. 2. When \u03bb is an integer or half-integer, the total\npersistent SC is zero because the persistent SC given by the eigenstates under the Fermi\nenergy cancel each other. The persistent SC are continuous to zero in the neighborhood of\nthe integer \u03bb while they discontinuous to zero and oscillate between 21 N\u03bb and \u2212 12 N\u03bb in the\nneighborhood of the half-integer \u03bb. Our results qualitatively accord with others obtained by\ncanonical quantization method[10]. Since all simple closed loop systems are homeomorphic\nto each other, by the above Euclidean path integral method one can readily find that the\npersistent SCs have the same properties if both simple closed loop systems with SOI have\nthe same circumference.\nThere is a \u03bb-dependent term Stop of the image time action in the QPF,\nZ \u03b2\nStop \u2261 i\u03c3\nd\u03c4 \u03bb\u03b8\u0307 = \u03c3\u03bb(\u03b8(\u03b2) \u2212 \u03b8(0)) = \u03c3i2\u03c0n\u03bb,\n\n(8)\n\n0\n\nwhich involves the WN of field configuration. The exponentiation of Stop contributes a\ncomplex number to QPF. Eq.(8) makes the topological aspects of the ring system particularly\n4\n\n\ftransparent. The integer and half-integer \u03bbs, of which the total persistent SC is zero, give\nthe exponentiation of Stop the real number +1 and \u22121, respectively.\nThe system is gauge invariant under the gauge transformation \u03c8(\u03b8) \u2192 ei\u2206\u03b8 \u03c8(\u03b8) while\nthe boundary condition is changed to \u03c8(0) = ei2\u03c0\u2206 \u03c8(2\u03c0) and derivative operator \u2202\u03b8 =\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b8\n\nto covariant derivative operator D\u03b8 = \u2202\u03b8 + i\u2206. The presence of the SOI amounts to a\ntwist in the boundary conditions and the persistent SC is a measure of the sensitivity of\nthe spectrum to the twist[12]. In ballistic limit the impurity scattering would not easily\ndestroy the coherence of wave functions represented by the WNs of the field configuration.\nThe effect of the impurity scattering would be resist by the discontinuousness of the WNs\nof the field configurations.\nThe periodic boundary condition is a restriction to the gauge potential. If we keep the\nboundary condition periodic, \u2206 must be an integer and the gauge transformation is discrete.\nIn the ring system, the effective gauge potential in Hamiltonian is reduced to a scalar \u03bb.\nWhen \u03bb are integers or half-integers, the system has the extra symmetry corresponding to\ndiscrete gauge transformation and then the total persistent SC must be zero.\nWhen the topology of the configuration of a system is changed, the persistent SCs in it\nwould be changed extremely. If a thin radial cut is made in a ring, its topological space\ndenoted X is trivially homeomorphic to a closed interval and the first homotopy group \u03c01 (X)\nis the trivial (one-element) group. The boundary condition is \u03c8(0) = \u03c8(2\u03c0) = 0 which is\njs\n0.5\n\n\u03bb\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n-0.5\n\nFIG. 2: The values of the circular total persistent SC in a ring where \u03bb in units of ~2 /mR and j s\nin unites of N \u03bb.\n\n5\n\n\fconfined and lacks the periodicity. The spectrum of the cut ring system is\n1\n1\n\u01ebn,\u00b1 = n2 \u2212 \u03bb2 ,\n8\n2\n\nn \u2208 Z.\n\n(9)\n\nSince the spectrum of the new system is symmetric to n whatever \u03bb is, there is no persistent\nSC in it. If it were nonzero, otherwise there would be infinite accumulation of spin at\nboundaries.\nIt has been shown that the persistent SC is connected with Berry phase in configuration\nspace and WNs of field configuration which is connected with the first homotopy group, a\nmain concept in algebraic topology, of the configuration of a system. The existence of the\npersistent SC is only connected with the property of the first homotopy group. Thus one\ncan prejudge the existence of the persistent SC without solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equations.\nIt is convenient to use the topology-theoretical method in 2DES where the solution of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation could not be easily obtained[17]. Whether the boundary condition in\n1DES is periodic or not corresponds to the nontrivial or trivial homotopy group, respectively.\nIn general, the configuration space of a system is an n-dimensional manifold denoted M and\nthe boundary of M denoted \u2202M has (n \u2212 1) dimensions. If the manifold is bounded with a\nboundary, the confined boundary condition could be \u03c8|\u2202M = 0 if we ignore the edge state\nof systems.\nThe manifolds of finite 2D systems are classified by simple connectedness. The 2D manifold has a trivial homotopy group if it is simple connected where any two paths having the\nsame initial and final points are path homotopic. Usually, \u03c8|\u2202M = 0 gives the complete\nconfined boundary condition. For example, the boundary condition in the unit square SOI\nsystem are \u03c8|y=0 = \u03c8|y=1 = 0,\n\n\u03c8|x=0 = \u03c8|x=1 = 0. One can readily conclude there is no\n\npersistent SC, otherwise there would be infinite accumulation of spin at the edge. However,\nthere is an exception that a persistent SC could exist in a 2D disk with SOI. The boundary\ncondition \u03c8|\u2202M = 0 is only confined in the radial direction \u03c8|r=1 = 0, where we set the radius\nunit for simplicity. The angular boundary condition is periodic \u03c8(\u03b8) = \u03c8(\u03b8 + 2\u03c0). A circular\npersistent SCs around the center point O could exist in the disk. In topological viewpoint,\nthe center point O of a 2D disk D is a fixed point under rotation which does not contribute\nto the circular persistent SC. Thus the manifold which contribute to the persistent SC is\nhomeomorphic to D \u2212 {O} where the WNs can be defined.\nIf the manifolds are not simple connected, there must be at least two paths having the\n6\n\n\fsame initial and final points which are not path homotopic. Thus there are some non-trivial\ntopological terms of the image time action in QPF which would affect the spectrum of the\nsystems and give the nonzero persistent SCs. For example, in a cylinder system \u03c8|\u2202M = 0\nonly give a confined boundary condition in axial direction and there are periodic boundary\ncondition around the axis in the cylinder surface. A persistent SC would circuit around the\naxis in the cylindrical surface, see Fig.3. Since a finite width rings, the common mesoscopic\nsystems, are not simple connected, a circular persistent SC would exist in them. It has\nbeen shown that the persistent SC can be detect by measure the induced electric field[18]\nor mechanical torque[19].\n\n\u2193\n\nFIG. 3: Schematic diagram for the circular movement of spin in a cylinder.\n\nThe SCs in the infinite 2D system found by Rashba is so mysterious that their existence\nand the conventional definition of the SC are doubted. However, the persistent SC which is\ntransport in a mesoscopic ring with SOI is satisfied the conventional definition of the SC.\nSince the conventional definition of the SC makes physical sense, they might need not to be\nmodified[20]. It has been shown that in the finite 1DES and 2DES the nonzero persistent\nSCs which satisfy the conventional definition are all transport when the boundary conditions\nis considered. It could be shown that the discrete wave functions considered by Rashba could\nexist in not only the infinite 2D topological space R2 but also the finite topological space of\na torus T 2 . Since the wave functions is periodic in two dimensions, there are an equivalence\nrelation \u223c which satisfies (x1 , y1) \u223c (x2 , y2 ) if x2 = x1 + 2\u03c0nx and y2 = y1 + 2\u03c0ny . The\ntopological space of the system can also be the quotient space R2 / \u223c which is the torus\n7\n\n\fT 2 = S 1 \u00d7 S 1 [14]. The first homotopy group \u03c01 (T 2 ) of a torus is isomorphic to Z \u00d7 Z[15].\nThus there might be two independent persistent SCs in the 2D torus SOI system, see Fig.4.\nThe background SCs in the infinite 2DES with SOI found by Rashba could be realized by\nthe transport persistent SCs in the topological space of a torus. In this sense, we meet the\nchallenge proposed by Rashba.\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\nFIG. 4: Schematic diagram for the circular movement of spin in a torus.\n\nIn summary, we investigate the persistent SCs in 1DES and 2DES with SOI in thermodynamic equilibrium at absolute zero temperature. The persistent SC is the intrinsic one\nwhich is connected with Berry phase in the configuration space of a system and WNs of\nfield configuration of electrons. The existence of persistent SCs is only connected with the\nproperty of the first homotopy group of the configuration of a system. The persistent SC\nwould not be destroyed by impurity scattering in ballistic limit. The background nonzero\nSCs found by Rashba in infinite 2DES with SOI could be realized by the transport persistent\nSCs in a finite torus electron system. In this sense, we meet Rashba's challenge.\nWe thank Q. Q. Wang, N. N. Huang, Hugo de Garis, C. Hao, M. T. Cheng, Z. K. Guo\nand K. Zhu for helpful discussions.
