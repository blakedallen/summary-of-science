We discuss the importance of different\neffects, such as the position of one-neutron emission threshold, the effective interaction or the number\nof valence particles on the magnitude of this correction.\nPACS number(s): 21.60.Cs, 23.40.-s, 23.40.Hc, 25.40.Lw\n\nNuclear structure of light neutron-rich nuclei has attracted much attention because of unusual spatial features of these nuclei [1] and the isospin effects in the\nmagic numbers [2]. In this respect, the systematics of\nneutron separation energies Sn and interaction crosssection in sd shell region seem to indicate the disappearance of N = 20 closure and the appearance of new shell\nclosure at N = 16 in neutron-rich nuclei with TZ \u2265 3\nclose to the drip-line [2]. Another astonishing property\nis a large change of the neutron drip-line by adding one\nproton to the oxygen core, as indicate the instability of\noxygen isotopes for N > 16 [4,5] and the stability of 31 F\nwith N = 22 [5]. Theoretical description of the low-lying\nstates properties in these nuclei requires taking into account the coupling between discrete and continuum correlated states [3,6]. This aspect is particularly important\nnear drip-line where one has to use both structure and\nreaction data to understand basic shell structure and dynamics of these nuclei [2,7]. In weakly bound light nuclei, not only coupling of bound states to continuum is\nstrong but also many-body correlations should be treated\nrigorously. Both the continuum coupling and the realistic configuration mixing can be taken into account in\nthe Shell Model Embedded in the Continuum (SMEC)\n[6]. This approach provides a unified description of diverse nuclear characteristics such as the energy spectra,\nincluding nucleon emission widths and electromagnetic\ntransition probabilities, and the reactions involving onenucleon in the continuum [6,7]. In this work, we analyze\nin the Shell Model (SM) framework the continuum correction to binding energies and neutron separation energies.\nThe detailed description of SMEC formalism has been\ngiven elsewhere [6,7]. Separation of (quasi-) bound (Q\nsubspace) and scattering (P subspace) states is achieved\nusing the projection operator technique [8]. P contains\nasymptotic channels made of (A \u2212 1)-particle localized\nstates and one nucleon in the scattering state. Localized many-body states which are build up by the bound\nand resonance single-particle (s.p.) wave functions, are\nincluded in Q. They are obtained by solving standard\nmulticonfigurational SM problem for the Hamiltonian\n\nHQQ . The residual coupling HP Q between states in Q\n(0)\n\u03c3\nand P is given by [6] : V12 = \u2212V12 [\u03b1 + \u03b2P12\n]\u03b4(r1 \u2212 r2 ),\n\u03c3\nwhere \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 1 and P12 is the spin exchange operator. The effective SM Hamiltonian including the coueff\npling to the continuum is energy-dependent : HQQ\n(E) =\n(+)\n\n(+)\n\nHQQ + HQP GP (E)HP Q , where GP (E) is a Green\nfunction for the motion of single nucleon in the P subeff\nspace. HQQ\nis a complex-symmetric matrix above E (thr)\nand Hermitian below it. The energy scale is settled by\nthe one-nucleon emission threshold E (thr) [6]. Radial s.p.\nwave functions in Q and the scattering wave functions\nin P are generated in a self-consistent procedure, starting with the average potential of Woods-Saxon type with\nthe spin-orbit and Coulomb parts included, and taking\ninto account the residual coupling. This procedure yields\nnew orthonormalized wave functions in Q and P and new\nself-consistent potentials for each many-body state in Q.\nIn the present studies we use the full sd valence space\nfor N < 20 and the full pf shell for N > 20. For the\neffective interaction in HQQ we take USD Hamiltonian\n\u2032\nfor the sd shell [9] and the KB interaction for the pf\nshell [11]. The cross-shell interaction is the G-matrix [10].\nIn the calculation of binding energies from the nuclear\nenergies in SMEC and SM, we proceed as in Refs. [12].\nThe ground state (g.s.) continuum coupling correceff\ntion in SMEC is calculated as : Ecorr =< \u03a6g.s. |HQQ\n\u2212\nHQQ |\u03a6g.s. >, the g.s. wave function in parent nucleus\n(N, Z) is coupled to different channel wave functions,\nwhich are determined by the motion of an unbound neutron relative to the daughter nucleus (N \u2212 1, Z) in a cer(N \u22121)\n. The magnitude of coupling matrix\ntain SM state \u03a6i\nelements vary depending on the structure of SM wave\n(N \u22121)\nand the value of one-neutron emission\nfunction \u03a6i\n(thr)\nthreshold En . The individual contributions for different channel couplings tend to decrease with increasing\n(N \u22121)\ndue to a growing\nexcitation energy of a SM state \u03a6i\nmismatch of both quantum numbers and radial properties of wave functions in parent and daughter nuclei [14].\nThis decrease is exponential on average. In the present\nstudies, we include all asymptotic channels composed of\nSM states; their number vary from 3 in 28 O to 1837\n1\n\n\fWoods-Saxon central part of radius R0 = 1.27A1/3 fm,\ndepth V0 (N, Z) = \u221251.1[1 \u2213 0.69(N \u2212 Z)/(N + Z)]\nMeV (\u2212/+ stands for neutron/proton potential), diffuseness a = 0.67 fm. The spin-orbit potential is\nVso \u03bb2\u03c0 (2l * s)r\u22121 df (r)/dr with \u03bb2\u03c0 = 2 fm2 , Vso (N, Z) =\n0.131V0 (N, Z) MeV and radial formfactor f (r) of the central potential. The Coulomb potential is calculated for\nthe uniformly charged sphere with radius R0 .\nFig. 1 shows results for oxygen isotopes. In our\n0h\u0304\u03c9 description, the continuum coupling in these nuclei\ncontains only neutron-neutron (T = 1) part. For the\n(nn)\n(0)\nstrength V0\n\u2261 V12 (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2) = 414 MeV*fm3 , one obtains a good overall agreement with the spectra of oxygen isotopes. For example, SMEC calculation in 24 O\nyields the first excited state 2+\n1 above the experimen(thr)\ntal En , in agreement with the data [15]. The nncontinuum coupling modifies T = 1 monopole terms [16]\nof the SM interaction. A good agreement for the binding\nsystematics in oxygen chain can be found provided the\nT = 1 part of two-body interaction is modified as follows\nT =1\nT =1\n: \u03b4V0d\n= \u22120.05 MeV, \u03b4V1s\n= +0.25 MeV,\n5/2 ,1s1/2\n1/2 ,0d3/2\nT =1\n\u03b4V0d\n=\n\u22120.35\nMeV.\n3/2 ,0d3/2\nFig. 1a shows the neutron number dependence of\n(thr)\nEcorr for (i) En\nof SMEC (solid line), and for (ii)\n(thr)\nEn\nfixed arbitrarily at 0 and 4 MeV (the dotted lines\nwith open squares and triangles, respectively). The N dependence of Ecorr in these three cases exhibits approximately quadratic dependence on the number of valence\nneutrons, which is usual for a monopole Hamiltonian\n[16]. Deviations from this dependence are characteris(thr)\ntic of the continuum coupling. For En\n= 0 (a limit of\none-neutron drip-line), one can see an odd-even staggering (OES) of Ecorr around an average N -dependence. A\nblocking of the virtual scattering to the particle continuum by an odd nucleon diminishes the continuum correction to the binding energy of broken-pair g.s. of oddN nuclei. This \"drip-line effect\", which is seen also in\nthe coordinate-space Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov approach\n[17], is restricted to a narrow window of excitation ener(thr)\ngies around En\n= 0. It vanishes if Ecorr is calculated\n(thr)\nfor En\n= 4 MeV (see the dotted line with triangles in\nFig. 1a).\n(thr)\nIf En\nis calculated in SMEC (the solid line), one\nfinds an opposite OES effect with enhanced Ecorr for odd(thr)\nN isotopes. This is due to En\nwhich is lower in oddN isotopes than in neighbouring even-N isotopes. This\nthreshold induced OES effect leads to the attenuation\nof OES of binding energies. An enhanced modification\nof one-neutron separation energies Sn is seen for odd-N\noxygen isotopes (see Fig. 1b). In general, the effect of\ncontinuum coupling on one- and two-neutron separation\nenergies is seen mainly for Sn <\n\u223c 3 MeV, i.e. close to the\none-neutron drip-line.\nIn fluorine isotopes, both neutron-neutron (T = 1) and\n\nin 31 F. Even though in most nuclei these channels are\nclosed, nevertheless the coupling to them modifies the\n(thr)\nand the strucbinding energy depending both on En\nture of the g.s. wave function.\n\nFIG. 1. The systematics of 0h\u0304\u03c9 SMEC correction in the\noxygen isotopes. (a) Neutron number dependence of the\nSMEC energy correction to the SM g.s. energy. The solid line\n(thr)\ncalcuis obtained for one-neutron emission threshold En\nlated in SMEC for each nucleus. The dotted line with squares\n(thr)\nwhich is fixed arbitrarily\nand triangles is obtained for En\nat 0 and 4 MeV, respectively. (b) One-neutron separation energies Sn calculated in SM (dashed line) and in SMEC (solid\nline) are compared with the data (closed circles with the error bars) [13]. (c) Two-neutron separation energies S2n in SM\nand SMEC. Symbols are the same as in (b).\n\nThe choice of the initial average potential follows a\nprocedure described in Ref. [7]. We demand, that the\nself-consistent potentials yield the energies of s.p. states\nat the same position as in the average potential with\n2\n\n\fneutron-proton (T = 0, 1) couplings between states in\nQ and P are present. The nn-coupling has been adjusted in the oxygen isotope chain and its value is kept\nunchanged. The optimal value of the strength of the np(np)\n(0)\ncontinuum coupling : V0\n\u2261 V12 (\u03b1 + \u03b2), varies from\n(np)\n(nn)\na standard value V0\n\u2243 2V0\nfor well-bound isotopes\n(np)\n(nn)\nat the valley of stability to V0\n\u2243 (1/2)V0\nnear\nthe neutron drip-line. This coupling modifies strongly\nT = 0 monopole terms of the SM Hamiltonian. For\n(np)\n(nn)\nV0\n\u2243 (1/2)V0 , good agreement for Sn , S2n and\nOES of binding energies [18] :\n\ntopes with those calculated in SMEC and in SM. SMEC\n(np)\n(nn)\nresults correspond to : V0\n= (1/2)V0\n(the solid\n(np)\n(nn)\nline) and V0\n= 2V0\n(the dotted line). SM results\nhave been obtained using two different SM interactions\n: (i) with the modified T = 0, 1 monopole terms (the\ndashed line), as discussed above, and (ii) without these\nmodifications (the dashed-dotted line). One can see that\nthe SM calculations overestimate systematically the OES\neffect, in particular close to the neutron drip-line. The\nnp-continuum coupling strongly attenuates the OES and\n(np)\n(nn)\nmay even wash it out for values of ratio V0 /V0 ,\nclose to the accepted value >\n\u223c 2 in nuclei from the valley\n\u2206(3) (N ) = ((\u22121)N /2)[E(N + 1) \u2212 2E(N ) + E(N \u2212 1)] (1) of stability.\n\nis found provided the T = 0 two-body interaction\nT =0\nis modified as follows : \u03b4V0d\n= +0.6 MeV,\n5/2 ,0d3/2\nT =0\n\u03b4V0d5/2 ,0f7/2 = +0.9 MeV.\nFig. 2a shows the neutron number dependence of Ecorr\n(np)\nfor fluorine isotopes, which is calculated for V0\n=\n(nn)\n(1/2)V0 . Ecorr depends both on |Np \u2212 Nn | and\n(Np + Nn ) (compare Figs. 1a and 2a), where Np , Nn\nare the number of protons and neutrons in the valence\nspace. Three cases shown in Fig. 2a can be directly com(thr)\n= 4 MeV,\npared with those shown in Fig. 1a. For En\none can see the OES of Ecorr which is absent in the oxygen chain. This is the salient feature of the np-coupling.\nEcorr in odd-odd isotopes is increased as compared to the\nneighboring odd-even ones. The size of Ecorr in this case\n(thr)\nis weakly dependent on the precise value of En . Qualitatively similar effect can be seen also at the neutron\n(thr)\ndrip-line (see the results for En\n= 0 in Fig. 2a) but\nnow the OES due to the np-coupling is attenuated by\nan opposite staggering due to the nn-coupling (see also\n(thr)\nFig. 1a). If En\nis calculated in SMEC for each nucleus (the solid line), the OES of Ecorr around a smooth\nN -dependence is enhanced due to combined effects of the\n(thr)\nnp-continuum coupling, which weakly depends on En ,\nand the nn-continuum coupling, which closely follows the\n(thr)\nOES of En . These two effects act 'in phase', hence\ncontributing an additional binding for odd-N nuclei.\nA strong sensitivity of Ecorr in fluorine chain to the\n(np)\nvalue of the strength V0\ncan be seen in Figs. 2b and\n2c which show the neutron number dependence of Sn and\nS2n . The dashed line shows the SM results, whereas the\n(nn)\n(np)\n= (1/2)V0 .\nsolid line gives SMEC results for V0\nThe agreement of SMEC results with the experimental\ndata is excellent for neutron-rich nuclei. The dotted line\nin Figs. 2b and 2c corresponds to SMEC calculation\n(nn)\n(np)\n= 2V0 . For this standard value, one finds\nwith V0\na somewhat better agreement with the experimental data\nfor light fluorine isotopes. On the contrary, description\nof neutron-rich nuclei is poor.\nA useful indicator of OES is \u2206(3) (N ) (Eq. 1). Fig. 3\ncompares experimental data for \u2206(3) (N ) in fluorine iso-\n\nFIG. 2. The same as in Fig. 1 but for the fluorine isotopes.\nSMEC calculations shown by the solid line are performed\n(nn)\nfor the strengths of the continuum coupling : V0\n= 414\n(np)\n(nn)\nMeV*fm3 and V0\n= (1/2)V0\n. The dotted lines in (b)\n(np)\n(nn)\nand (c) have been obtained for V0\n= 2V0\n. The closed\ncircles with error bars shows the data [13].\n\n3\n\n\f(thr)\n\nIn summary, we have performed first large-scale SM\ncalculations including the coupling to the continuum\nstates which extend from the valley of stability up to\nthe neutron drip-line. Our analysis demonstrates an\nimportant renormalization of the effective SM Hamiltonian by the continuum coupling; the principal effects of\nthis renormalization depend on the position of the one(thr)\nneutron emission threshold En , on isospin T , its projection TZ and on the number of valence particles. Certain features of this renormalization can be simulated\nin SM studies by a suitable shifts of the two-body ma(thr)\ntrix elements. The dependence of Ecorr on both En\nand the number of valence neutrons Nn and protons Np\nimplies, however, that the two-body monopoles in SM\nstudies must contain the additional terms depending on\n(thr)\nEn , |Np \u2212 Nn |, and (Np + Nn ), which become important near the drip line.\n\nshifts of excitation energy for SM states close to En .\nThe TZ \u2212dependence of these shifts (see Figs. 1a and 2a)\nimplies that these SM states (e.g. intruder states) , even\nfor a constant value of one-neutron emission threshold,\nwill be pushed down by an amount which depends on TZ .\nThe coupling to the two-neutron continuum has not\nbeen included in the present analysis. This coupling\nis expected to be less important if Sn < S2n , i.e. for\n(thr)\nN < 18 in O- and F-isotope chains. Since E2n is a\nsmooth function of N and, moreover, varies slowly near\nthe neutron drip-line, therefore we expect that the coupling to the two-neutron continuum produces a smaller\neffect on the OES of binding energies than the coupling\nto the one-neutron continuum. One should keep in mind,\nhowever, that additional attractive correlations between\nnucleons in the scattering continuum are responsible for\nthe appearance of \"Borromean systems\" close to the oneneutron drip line [19].\nWe thank W. Nazarewicz for valuable suggestions and\nF. Nowacki for useful discussions.\n\nFIG. 3. The OES of binding energies (1) for SM (the\ndashed line) and SMEC with different ratios of np- and\n(nn)\n(np)\n= (1/2)V0\nnn- continuum coupling strengths : V0\n(np)\n(nn)\n(the solid line) and V0\n= 2V0\n(the dotted line). The\ndashed-dotted line with open diamonds, shows SM results\n\u2032\nfor the USD+KB interaction without the modification of\nT = 0, 1 monopole terms discussed in the text. The closed\npoints with error bars shows the data [13].\n\nWe have found an important attenuation of the OES\nof binding energies close to the neutron drip-line by the\nnp-continuum coupling. This attenuation does not mean\nthat the neutron pairing correlations become weaker (see\nFig. 1a) but that the np-continuum coupling 'falsifies'\n\u2206(3) (N ) indicator of neutron pairing.\nThe analysis of experimental data in SMEC indicates a\nsignificant attenuation of np-continuum coupling in nuclei with large neutron excess. A strong sensitivity of\n(np)\n(nn)\nSn (N ) and \u2206(3) (N ) to the value of V0 /V0\nallows\nto estimate this attenuation quantitatively.\nThe continuum coupling correction to energy of a SM\nstate depends strongly on the position of this state with\n(thr)\nrespect to En .
