INTRODUCTION\nA more intuitive understanding of the natural laws described by quantum mechanics is\nrequired to build more refined visualization and simulation tools for the development of\nquantum devices. Such an intuitive, realistic and non-local theory already exists for\nelectrons and other material particles, as originally conceived by de Broglie [1, 2] and\nredefined by Bohm [3]. However, to the best of our knowledge a similar model does not\nexist for photons. This paper proposes a first approach towards the construction of such a\ntheory. We notice that the first step towards the development of an intuitively friendly\ntheory for photons is the construction of a first quantized version of quantum\nelectrodynamics in space. The second step is to verify that one can indeed resolve the\nmeasurement problem and describe the quantum jumps in terms of real photon particles.\nThe correct formulation of these two tasks will prove to be of precious value at the time\nof design and simulation of quantum computers and communication systems.\nOne can start by noting that the roots of quantum mechanics can be traced to an attempt\nfor unification of the classical description of dispersion of light with the non-classical\ndescription provided by Bohr's atomic theory. In fact, both theories had been extensively\nverified experimentally, but seemed completely incompatible with one another.\nDispersion theory implied a dynamical continuous atomic polarization, while Bohr's\nmodel implied the presence of stationary states separated by quantum jumps associated\nwith the absorption and emission of electromagnetic radiation [4, 5]. The link was\nachieved by replacing the deterministic dynamical coefficients appearing in the\npolarization from the classical dispersion formula with the probabilistic Einstein\ncoefficients from Bohr's atomic theory. That attempt, built exclusively on the\nconsideration of the atomic dynamics, lead to the Kramers-Heisenberg dispersion\nformula [6] and eventually to the creation of the highly counterintuitive matricial form of\nquantum mechanics and to the introduction of noncommutative operators replacing\ndynamical variables in the classical equations of motion [7].\nA realistic model is proposed here, which can reconcile classical dispersion theory and\nBohr's atomic model. This model is based on the original proposal of Slater [5, 8],\ninspired in the de Broglie-Einstein ideas about the electromagnetic fields and photon\nparticles. In Slater's model both, electromagnetic waves and photon particles were\nassigned physical existence in space, the waves, or photon-wave-functions, serving as\nguiding fields for the photons. One can verify that such a model is able to reconciliate\nwave and particle aspects of the interaction of radiation and matter, when the probability\nfor absorption for an incident photon is made equal to the relative absorption of energy\nprovided by the classical dispersion theory. This will be achieved as soon as photons are\nmade to follow the Poynting vector, and its probability density made proportional to the\nelectromagnetic energy density of the incident field. In that case, the same cross section\nobtained from the classical dispersion theory for the absorption of energy, would apply\nequally well to the probability for the absorption of a photon in Bohr's model. As a\ncorollary, the transition amplitudes appearing in the Bohr model can be considered as\n-3-\n\n\fnumerically equal to the terms appearing in the classical dispersion coefficients as\nproposed by Ladenburg and followed by Kramers and Heisenberg [4, 5], in the steps\nprevious to the creation of quantum mechanics.\nWhile the interpretation of absorption as a virtual intermediate state in the process of\ndispersion in traditional quantum mechanics, induces one to consider both as two aspects\nof the same phenomenon, they correspond in our model to two different physical\nprocesses. Dispersion occurs every time an electromagnetic wave or photon-wavefunction impinges on an atomic system, independently from the position of the real\nphoton particle. It is responsible among others, for the generation of the index of\nrefraction of transparent media. Absorption on the other hand, takes place only when one\nincident photon particle occurs to come to a distance closer than the absorption cross\nsection and gets trapped by the atom, which now has been promoted to an excited state.\nThis paper develops a formal basis for these ideas towards a wider physical picture and is\nopen for future improvement. It presents in a systematic and clear way the physical ideas\nimplied by the use of photon-wave-functions and photon particles. To simplify the\nexposition in most of the paper, no consideration is given to any effect associated with\nthe spin of the particles, or with relativistic dynamics. In Section VIII however, a\nrelativistic generalization is presented and the relationship of this model with quantum\nelectrodynamics (QED) is given.\nThree different aspects of the interaction between light and matter provide the basis for\nour model. The first aspect is the transformation over time suffered by the intuitive\ndescription of quantum electromagnetic fields. This description started as a mathematical\ntool deprived from any real physical existence, and evolved to a form more reminiscent\nof classical electrodynamics in recent times. This evolution encouraged our visualization\nof the fields as having a reality in space, and expressed by the guiding conditions to\nwhich they give rise in this model. The second aspect is the development of a first\nquantization scheme for electrodynamics. In this scheme, the Maxwell equations are\ninterpreted as the equivalent to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and the electromagnetic fields\nare considered the photon-wave-functions. This is an important point, because in\nBohmian mechanics, the guiding conditions are provided by the wave functions\nassociated with the material particles in a first quantization theory. The third aspect is\nstill an open question in quantum mechanics: can we explain quantum jumps?\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II, a review of the concepts leading to our\nmodel is provided. In Section III, the interpretation of the Maxwell equations as the\nsingle photon Schr\u00f6dinger equation, the problems associated to the divergence of the\nfields at the sources, and a possible definition of attached and free fields are considered.\nIn Section IV, the formalism associated with the generalized Schr\u00f6dinger-Maxwell\nequation is presented, where photons are treated on the same footing as any other\nmaterial particle. In Section V, the generalization to many particles and the selection of\nindependent variables are analyzed. In Section VI, the guidance condition for the\n-4-\n\n\felectron and photon in the extended configuration space is provided. In Section VII, the\nnew formalism is applied to scattering, absorption, dispersion, resonance fluorescence,\nquantum jumps and vacuum fields in a two level system. In Section VIII, a possible\nrelativistic generalization is presented, together with its relationship to QED. In Section\nIX, previous criticism raised again realistic models is considered, and in Section X, we\npresent our conclusions.\n\nII. REVIEW OF THE CONCEPTS LEADING TO THIS MODEL\nThis paper proposes a reformulation of some of the ideas and equations prevailing in the\ndescription of quantum optics today. Therefore, a relatively complete review of the most\nrelevant developments leading to the ideas exposed in this work is needed in order to gain\nthe more general perspective required for a better appreciation of this proposal.\nA. Visualization of the quantum electromagnetic field.\nWe start considering how the intuitive visualization of the process of emission of\nelectromagnetic radiation evolved with time since the first works at the beginning of\nquantum mechanics. In the framework of the old quantum theory of Bohr [9], emission of\nradiation was accomplished through a quantum jump from an atomic excited state to a\nlower energy state. In the theory of Dirac [10], this process was described by the abstract\ncreation of a one-photon state of the electromagnetic field with well-defined momentum,\nrepresented by a set of quantum mechanical operators. These operators as well as the\nelectron-wave-functions had no real existence in space. They were seen as a purely\nmathematical and formal representation of the process that was being described. An\nimportant property of that theory was the fact that it made no allowance for the radiation\nreaction fields, responsible for the decay of the oscillatory motion in classical\nelectrodynamics. By contrast, quantum electrodynamics considered the emission process\nas induced by the so-called vacuum fields or vacuum fluctuations [11, 12].\nIn the 1960s, a description of spontaneous emission in terms of radiation reaction was\ndeveloped, first as a semiclassical theory [13], and later making full use of the quantum\nmechanical equations of motion in the Heisenberg's picture [14]. In addition, the van der\nWaals and Casimir forces were recalculated and explained without the need for vacuum\nfluctuations [15].\nIn the 1970s the coherence properties of fields emitted by atoms were further analyzed\n[16], and it was shown that retardation effects, of long known history in classical\nelectromagnetism could be invoked for the high frequency cut off in the non-relativistic\ncalculation for the Lamb shift [17]. Retardation effects were also considered for the\ninteraction between different atoms [18] in the cooperative effects described by Dicke's\nmodel [19].\n-5-\n\n\fIn the early 1980s, working on causality effects in the proximity of atoms and molecules,\nBykov [20] was able to show that the near fields operators follow exactly the same\nequations and have the same solutions as the classical fields. At the same time, Barut\n[21] started a series of papers showing that many of the effects previously considered of\npurely quantum origin, produced by the vacuum fields, could also be explained by\nclassical fields, allowing for a more complicated mathematics. Among these effects, we\ncan mention spontaneous emission and Lamb shift, van der Waals forces, Casimir forces,\naccelerating thermal fields, etc. In the following years, the works by the groups of Persico\n[22] and Power [23] yielded an increased visualization of the electromagnetic fields\nsurrounding atoms. They also showed that causality could be fully re-established by\nrequiring the retention of non-resonant terms in the fields, commonly through away in the\nrotating wave approximation [24].\nAll these works provided a more complete understanding of the electromagnetic fields\nsurrounding the atoms and their interactions. As a result, the originally abstract and\nindeterministic picture of emission of radiation into a state of well-defined momentum\nwas giving place to a more intuitive and 'realistic' picture in space and time, increasingly\nreminiscent of classical electrodynamics.\nB. First quantization schemes for the electromagnetic field.\nClassical electrodynamics [25] and optics [26] show that electromagnetic fields display a\nvery rich geometry, depending on the shape of the source currents and boundary\nconditions. The classical theory for the scattering by small particles [27, 28] makes use\nof spherical Bessel functions based on the work of Mie [29]. Also, classical antenna\ntheory is concerned mostly with the near and far fields in the dipole approximation [30].\nSimilar treatments can be found in the semiclassical descriptions commonly used in Xray diffraction and nuclear physics. X-ray diffraction by crystals can be explained in\nterms of the far field dipole emission or plane waves [31, 32, 33], as originally shown by\nDarwin [34] and by Ewald [35]. Nuclear radiation [36, 37, 38, 39, 40] has always been\ndescribed in terms of the spherical harmonics developed by Hansen [41] and Heitler [42].\nAll these treatments contrast with the tradition in quantum optics, used to decompose the\nquantum fields in plane waves [43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48], while working in the Coulomb\ngauge with transverse and longitudinal delta functions [49, 50, 51, 52].\nA superficial consideration of quantum optics may create the impression that a\ngeometrical distinction between classical and quantum fields really exist: while classical\nfields may have any geometry, quantum fields are restricted in most cases to plane waves.\nThat this is really not the case is demonstrated by the source field expression in quantum\noptics [53, 54, 55], which shows that quantum electromagnetic fields produced by a point\nsystem have a spherical description, very similar to the classical one [56, 57, 58]. We\nfind here again, that one could unify the rich geometric features of classical\nelectrodynamics with the quantum properties of quantum optics, by considering a first\nquantized version of quantum electrodynamics, where the solutions to the Maxwell\n-6-\n\n\fequations were considered wave functions for photon particles. This is not the standard\nway however, in which quantum electrodynamics has evolved. In fact, in semiclassical\napproximations [59], and in quantum optics [60], the systems are described in terms of\nparticle positions and electromagnetic fields, while in second (or canonical) quantization\n[61, 62, 63, 64], the only physical quantities are the fields themselves. So, depending on\nthe approach one selects, one has the choice to describe material particles by their\nposition or by quantized fields, but not such option is offered for photons. The traditional\ntheory provides no place for a photon position or velocity as a physical quantity in the\ndescription of the quantized electromagnetic field. We should remember however, that in\nthe first approach to a quantum description of light, Einstein [65] proposed in 1905 that\nlight was composed of real particles in space.\nThis state of facts had its origin in Dirac's original work [66] on the quantization of the\nelectromagnetic field in 1927. In that paper, the electromagnetic field was not considered\nthe equivalent to the wave function for photons, but Dirac considered instead the\namplitude of the electromagnetic field itself as the physical quantity to be quantized.\nEach Fourier component of the field was considered equivalent to an independent\nharmonic oscillator coupled to the sources of radiation through the interaction\nHamiltonian. This theory was further developed by Heisenberg and Pauli [67] and\nrecapitulated by Fermi [68], reaching the general form that has been in use until today.\nThe reason for considering the field as the primary variable to be quantized instead of the\npossible photon coordinates, seems to be the generalized reluctance to the idea that light\ncould eventually be composed of material particles.\nOn the other hand, Landau and Peierls [69] published in 1930 a work about the\ngeneralized wave function of a system consisting of matter particles and of photon\nparticles. This wave function consisted of a collection of functions with fix number of\nparticles multiplied by time dependent coefficients in configuration space. They assumed\nthat the role of photon-wave function was played exclusively by the electric field. There\nthe photons were considered on an equal footing with the other particles. The main\ndifference between the material particles and the photons was the existence of sources for\nthe photon field. This fact was not considered harmful for the general development of the\ntheory. The authors were able to show instead, that the sum of the norms of the functions\nbelonging to different number of particles remained constant. The variation of the norm\nof these functions had two sources: the time variation of the respective coefficients, and\nthe radiation sources for the photon fields. This was a marked difference with the\ncustomary methods of treating systems with variable number of particles, as described in\nthe 1932 paper by Fock [70], where no references to photon sources was made at all. In\nthat work, Fock demonstrated the full equivalence of working with the creation operator\nformalism of second quantization for bosons and fermions, and the use of wave functions\nwith constant norm for different number of particles, but multiplied by time dependent\ncoefficients.\n\n-7-\n\n\fThe two ways of considering the quantization of the electromagnetic field (namely the\nDirac and the Landau-Peierls formalism) were compared by Oppenheimer [71] in 1931,\nwho concluded that Landau and Peierls source theory was not right because of the\nappearance of negative energies and photon densities. These were however, exactly the\nsame problems initially attributed to Dirac's relativistic electron equation. Even when\nthose problems didn't prevent a full success for Dirac's electron theory, no more work\nseems to have been done in this direction for photons until 1949, with the exception of a\nwork by Kemmer [72] in 1939, who analyzed a spinorial expression for the Maxwell\nequations including the potentials in the Lorentz gauge. In 1949, Moliere [73] proposed\nthe use of the electromagnetic field vectors in complex notation, previously developed by\nSilberstein in 1907 [74] as the photon-wave-function, and to use spherical solutions for\nthe Maxwell's equations. Silberstein defined the complex electromagnetic fields\nfunctions as F = E + icB , where E and B were the electric and magnetic fields as usual. It\ncan be noticed that Oppenheimer [71] in his previous paper also recognized the\nSilberstein functions as the appropriated wave functions for the photon.\nFor a period of about 20 years, work about photon-wave-functions focused mainly on the\nproblem of localizability of particles with zero mass. The works by Pryce [75], Newton\nand Wigner [76], Whightman and collaborators [77] came invariably to the conclusion\nthat zero mass particles with spin equal to one (like the photon) would not allow for the\nexistence of wave functions able to localize a free particle in space as was possible with\nthe other particles. As a corollary, they concluded that the photon as an independent\nparticle could not exist. This was intimately related to the fact that the free\nelectromagnetic field is divergence less in free space, and that a satisfactory and\nrelativistically well-behaved position operator with commuting components could not be\ndefined mathematically at that time [78]. We would like to remark that the problems\npresented in those papers were related to the impossibility for defining photon-wavefunctions able to confine the photon to a precisely defined region of space. On the other\nhand, they could not prevent the possibility of postulating the existence of photons as\nparticles in space independently from the properties of the wave functions to which they\nwere associated. Two different solutions appeared to be possible at that time: 1) to\nrenounce to the full localization of the photon, and accept only partial localization in\nsmall volumes or 2) propose that the photon mass could be different from zero and to\nwork inside the framework of the Proca equation [79, 80] for spin 1 particles with\nnonzero mass. The first approach was proposed by Jauch and Piron [81], and Amrein\n[82] and developed explicitly in the model by Mandel [83], while the second approach\nwas developed by Belinfante [84] and discussed by Bass and Schr\u00f6dinger [85].\nWe should mention here the strong analogy that exists between the Silberstein's functions\nfor the electromagnetic field and the solutions of the Dirac's equation for the relativistic\nelectron. The electromagnetic fields are typically considered solutions of the Maxwell's\nsecond order differential equations, but in the Silberstein's notation, they are also\nsolutions to a spinorial linear equation, as shown by Good [86] and Moses [87].\nSimilarly, the electron Dirac equation, which originally was presented in spinorial form,\n-8-\n\n\fcan also be rewritten as a set of second order differential equations for the electron\nfunction and for the time derivative of that function, as was shown by Feynman and GellMann [88]. The original form of the Dirac equation and the spinorial form of the\nMaxwell equations are almost identical. Besides the finite electron mass, the only\ndifference is that the Dirac's electron-wave-functions have four components, while the\nelectromagnetic fields in complex notation have only three components, namely the three\ncomponents of the electromagnetic field in space.\nSurpassing the problems mentioned above with the particle interpretation for the photon,\nsome works were published in the 1970-1990 period. For example the work by Moses\n[87], who showed that by working with spherical eigenvectors of the curl operator, not\nonly interpretational advantages could be achieved, but also practical benefits, such as the\nrigorous determination of transition matrix elements. In the early 1980s, Cook [89] was\nable to show that the photon dynamics in free space was Lorentz covariant. After 1990,\nthe main point was the realization that the wave function represented the probability for\nfinding the photon energy at a given position in space. Among them, we can mention the\nworks by I. Bialynicki-Birula [90,91], Inagaki [92], and Gersten [93]. The first one to\nconsider the explicit interaction of radiation and matter in the context of photon-wavefunctions appears to be Sipe [94], who also showed that the second quantization\nformalism, when applied to the photon-wave-functions, provides the same results as the\ntraditional method in the description of the photon-atom interaction. Keller has\ndeveloped a detailed model recently [95], where however, correlations between the\nmatter fields and photon fields are not considered, and it is not possible to generate\nentanglement between the photons and the atomic system. A real breakthrough has been\ngiven recently by Margaret Hawton and coworkers [96], who obtained an explicit\nexpression for the position operator with commuting components for the photon,\ntherefore invalidating the work done in the decades of the '50 and '60 about the formal\nimpossibility of defining photon as material particles.\nC. Quantum jumps and the photon particle.\nFrom the beginning of the study of atomic processes, it seemed apparent that matter\nunderwent discontinuous evolution. In the old quantum theory developed by Niels Bohr\n[9] in the 1910s, this was expressed by the assumption of the existence of 'quantum\njumps'. In that theory, the atom could be found in the excited stationary states for a\nperiod comparable to the mean lifetime of the state, and then it decayed spontaneously, in\na quantum jump, to the ground state, similar to the radioactive emission of particles by\nthe atomic nucleus [97]. With the full development of quantum mechanics, these\ndiscontinuous transitions were later identified with the process of measurement. It was\nvon Neumann [98] in 1932, who established clearly the Copenhagen interpretation for the\nact of measurement. In this interpretation, because of every measurement, the wave\nfunction collapses into the subspace of the Hilbert space spanned by the result of the\nmeasurement. Also as a result of the measurement, the observed system plus the\nmeasurement apparatus are left in a correlated state, indicating that if the apparatus shows\n-9-\n\n\fa result \u03b1 for the observable A, then the observed system is left in the subspace\ncorresponding to the eigenvector of A with eigenvalue \u03b1. A following measurement of A\nwill give inevitably the same value \u03b1. In this interpretation, it could be said that the act of\nmeasurement of the photon by the detector, collapses the state of the atom from the\noriginal excited state, to the ground state.\nThe exact definition of measured system and measuring apparatus is not a clear cut in\nquantum mechanics, but at the same time, different selections for the line separating\nsystem from measuring apparatus cannot modify the result of the measurement. In fact,\none can argue that if we measure the photon at a given time, this means that the atom\ndecayed to the ground state emitting the photon at a previous time allowing the photon to\ntravel through space and reach the detector. Under this interpretation, it would be the\nphoton the measuring apparatus, and the collapse of the atomic wave function would take\nplace before the measurement by the detector, namely during the photon emission itself.\nA first experimental observation of these quantum jumps was performed in the late 1970s\nby the observation of the antibunching effect in the single atom emission by Mandel [99]\nand collaborators. This effect shows that after the emission of a photon by an atom, one\nhas to wait a finite amount of time in order for the atom to be able to emit a second\nphoton, even when the laser pump remains at a constant power. This fact is interpreted\nby saying that if the atom collapses (jumps) to the ground state after the emission of the\nfirst photon, it will need some time to be re-excited again and re-emit a second photon as\nshown by the quantum regression theorem [100].\nSince then, quantum jumps have been observed in other experiments [101, 102] proposed\ninitially by Dehmelt [103] in 1975, where the atoms get shelved in an excited state and\nare unable to absorb or scatter radiation from the ground state. After the first works\ndirected to understand this phenomenon [104], numerous theoretical work has been done\nin order to incorporate the quantum jumps into the repertoire of physics [105]. On the\ntheoretical side, the inclusion of quantum jumps has been used as an alternative approach\nin simulations to reproduce the time evolution of the density matrix. In these simulations,\nthe average system is described as a collection of many individual wave functions\nfollowing periods of continuous evolution and random quantum jumps followed by the\nrenormalization of the wave function [106].\nIn spite of all these developments, the main question about the quantum jumps remains\nthe same since the time of Bohr, namely: what triggers the jump? Traditional quantum\nmechanics is unable to answer this question, however realistic theories can provide an\nanswer at the time they are solving the problem of measurement. Entanglement of the\nwave function, makes the quantum potential dependent on the position of all the particles\ncomposing the system. When one particle enters some specific wave-packet that has no\nspatial overlapping with the other ones, the only part of the wave function felt by the\nremaining particles in the system is the one directly correlated to the one that is occupied.\nA simple explanation offers by itself in the case of photon emission: if the photon leaving\nthe atom is correlated only with the atomic ground state, after emission the electron sees\n- 10 -\n\n\fonly the ground state wave-function and stops oscillating. This should happen in a period\ncomparable with the time it takes to the photon to leave the atom vicinity; we can say that\na 'quantum jump' has occurred.\n\nIII. PHOTON-WAVE FUNCTIONS\nIn this Section, we start with the development of our formalism. In part A we provide the\npresent status about the consideration of the electromagnetic fields and potentials as the\nphoton-wave-functions. In part B we consider the separation of the electromagnetic\nfields into free and attached to the particles. This separation will prove to be of\nfundamental importance for the generation of entanglement between the electromagnetic\nfields and the atomic systems.\nA. Maxwell's equations as the single photon Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nInduced by the developments described in the previous Section, we propose to consider\nthe electromagnetic field as representing the wave function for photons. In support of\nthis idea, we mention that Moses [87, 107] was able to show that Maxwell's equations\ntake the form:\n1\u2202\n\u2212\n\u03a8rad = H 0 \u03a8rad \u2212 4\u03c0\u03a6 ,\ni \u2202t\nwhere \u03a8rad (rph ) is a four-element column matrix constructed with the electric and\n\nmagnetic fields, \u03a6 (rph ) is a source-current term, the Hamiltonian H 0 is given by\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1\nH 0 = \u03b1 \u22c5 \u2207 , and \u03b1 = \u03b1 x , \u03b1 y , \u03b1 z is a set of 4x4 matrices. With these definitions, the\ni\nsimilarity with the Dirac equation for the electron is evident, and in the absence of\nsources, their only difference is the existence of a finite electron mass. We can mention\nthat conversely, the creation of an electron-positron pair by a gamma ray also admits a\ndescription allowing for a source term [108, 109].\nWhen we consider the interaction between matter and light, we find that the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation involves the electromagnetic potentials, in addition to the electric and magnetic\nfields. We need therefore to find an expression where these potentials are available at the\nsame time than the electric and magnetic fields. In some sense, the potentials store\ninformation about the history of the fields, and deserve to be considered, as noted by\nBohm and Aharanov [110], on the same footing as the electromagnetic fields. In order to\nkeep track of the fields as well as the potentials, Kemmer [72] developed in 1939 a\nspinorial representation of the Maxwell equations, including not only the electric and\nmagnetic fields, but also the electromagnetic potentials in the Lorentz gauge. The time\nevolution of this spinor was governed by the following Schr\u00f6dinger-like equation:\n- 11 -\n\n\fih\n\n\u2202\u03a8rad (rph , t )\n\u2202t\n\n= H ph \u03a8rad (rph , t ) + J (rph , t )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere J (rph , t ) was a new source function. In Kemmer's approach, the Schr\u00f6dinger-like\n\nequation represented the Maxwell's equations:\n\u2202E\n\u2202B\n\u2202A\n\u2202\u03c6\n= \u2207 \u00d7B \u2212 j,\n= \u2212\u2207 \u00d7 E ,\n= \u2212E \u2212 \u2207\u03c6 ,\n= \u2207\u22c5A\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\nwhere the last equation is the Lorentz condition for the potentials. We remark here that\neq. (1) holds as an alternative formulation of the classical Maxwell equations, and as the\nHeisenberg equation of motion fulfilled by the electromagnetic field operators in\nquantum electrodynamics. Kemmer also studied the relativistic invariance properties of\nthe given matrix H ph , but we are not going into the details here. We only mention that\nthis representation is known as the Kemmer-Duffin-Harish-Chandra formalism [72]. Of\ncourse, one can rewrite Maxwell's equations following this formalism in the Coulomb\ngauge, at the price of losing Lorentz invariance.\nB. Separation into attached and free fields\n\nIt is well known that electromagnetic fields diverge at the position of the particles.\nTherefore, the electromagnetic fields are not normalizable and an infinite amount of\nenergy is assigned to them. This is in distinction with the wave functions for electrons,\nwhich are square integrable over the full space, and allow for an easy manipulation inside\nthe Hilbert space.\nThe purpose of this section is to show how it is possible to separate the electromagnetic\nfield in two parts. One part attached to the particle will be the responsible for the\ndivergences and non-normalizability of the electromagnetic fields. The other part,\nassociated with the radiated energy, will be normalizable and incorporated into the first\nquantization formalism of the Hilbert space.\nIn relation to the question of energy content of the system, we can avoid the divergence\nproblems of quantum electrodynamics by assigning the momentum and energy contents\nof the system to the particles, and not to the fields. The attached fields will play a role\nanalogous to potential energies, and therefore can diverge to infinity in some regions,\nwithout implying an infinite energy for the physical system.\nWe will encounter situations where the number of particles present in our system changes\nwith time. It is clear that the creation of a particle modifies the number of degrees of\nfreedom of the system by adding to the position and velocities of the already existing\nparticles, those corresponding to the newly created one. We can however reduce the use\nof a variable number of photons, by assuming that photons that have been coherently\nscattered still survived, confined inside the fields attached to the charged particles. This\npoint of view is in line with the original approach followed by Dirac [66] where the\n- 12 -\n\n\fvacuum state was just the ground state for the oscillators representing the radiation field.\nIn that approach, the act of emitting a photon merely changed the state but not the\nnumber of degrees of freedom of the system.\nAnother advantage of considering attached fields is that they will allow us to generate\nentanglement between the different states of the radiation field and the different states of\nthe atomic system.\nIn order to develop this idea further, let's consider the Maxwell's equation for the electric\nfield:\n\u239b 2 1 \u22022 \u239e\n\u2202J(r, t )\n\u239c\u239c \u2207 \u2212 2 2 \u239f\u239fE(r, t ) = \u03bc 0\nc \u2202t \u23a0\n\u2202t\n\u239d\nIt is clear that this equation describes two subsystems, the particle represented by the\ncurrent term, and the fields. Let's rewrite the electric field as the sum of two parts, which\nwe might call the attached fields linked to the particle, and the free fields propagating in\nfree space as E(r, t ) = Eatt (r, t ) + E free (r, t ) with Eatt (r, t ) and E free (r, t ) the attached and free\n\nfields respectively. Now we can rewrite the Maxwell equation as follows:\n\u239b 2 1 \u22022 \u239e\n\u2202J(r, t )\n\u239c\u239c \u2207 \u2212 2 2 \u239f\u239f(Eatt (r, t ) + E free (r, t )) = \u03bc 0\n.\nc \u2202t \u23a0\n\u2202t\n\u239d\nNobody can prevent us from defining an effective current density by the following\nexpression:\n\u2202J (r, t )\n\u2202J(r, t ) \u239b 2 1 \u2202 2 \u239e\n= \u03bc0\n\u03bc 0 free\n\u2212 \u239c\u239c \u2207 \u2212 2 2 \u239f\u239fEatt (r, t )\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\nc \u2202t \u23a0\n\u239d\nIn terms of this effective current density, we can rewrite the Maxwell equation for the\nfree fields as\n\u2202J (r, t )\n\u239b 2 1 \u22022 \u239e\n\u239c\u239c \u2207 \u2212 2 2 \u239f\u239fE free (r, t ) = \u03bc 0 free\n.\n\u2202t\nc \u2202t \u23a0\n\u239d\nOne can reinterpret this equation, as describing again two subsystems, but now they are\nthe effective current source for the free fields (which we can interpret as the original\nelectron current together with the attached fields), and the free radiation fields.\nThis is not a new idea; in fact, different models have proposed different lines separating\nattached from radiated fields. A first example is just given by the Coulomb gauge, where\nthe longitudinal electrostatic fields play the role of attached fields, and the transverse\nfields are considered radiated or free [50]. The source current for the free fields becomes\nthe well-known transverse current. Kramers [111], Pauli and Fierz [112] included the\nmagnetostatic fields derived from the stationary part of the velocity, in the attached\nfields. Indeed the idea of mass renormalization of quantum electrodynamics can be\ninterpreted as a relativistic generalization of the Kramers transformation [113, 114, 115],\nwhere the energy associated with the magnetostatic attached fields is incorporated into\n- 13 -\n\n\fthe experimentally observed electron mass. Finally, Keller included a transverse attached\nfield in the description of an oscillating dipole, and provided a unitary transformation\nleading to remove it [116]. For an oscillating dipole, we can see that all models draw the\ndividing line at a distance of about one wavelength from the source.\nIn this work, we will define the free fields as the acceleration fields, and the attached\nfields as the velocity fields. With this definition, we verify that the attached fields are\ndominant at a distance smaller than a wavelength from the atomic system, while the free\nfields are dominant at a distance larger that a wave length from the atomic center.\nWe anticipate here, that in the framework of a realistic model, photon particles should\nrespond to both attached and radiated fields. As long as the photon is closer to the atom\nthan one wavelength, the attached fields will govern its dynamics, so we can say that the\nphoton belongs to the atomic system, it is an absorbed photon. As soon as the photon\nleaves the proximity of the atomic system, it will be governed by the radiated fields and\nbecome a free photon, an emitted photon. Later in Section VII, we will analyze the\nobjections raised against the concept of a field attached to a particle.\nAccording to our definition, the attached fields for charged point particles are given by\n[117]:\n\u23a1\n\u23a4\nn\u02c6 \u2212 v c\n\u02c6 \u00d7Eatt (r, t )]ret ,\nEatt (r, t ) = e \u23a2 2\n, B att (r, t ) = [n\n3 2\u23a5\n\u23a2\u23a3 \u03b3 (1 \u2212 n\u02c6 \u22c5 v c ) r \u23a5\u23a6 ret\n\n(2)\n\nand the free fields by\nE free (r, t ) =\n\ne \u23a1n\u02c6 \u00d7 {(n\u02c6 \u2212 v c )\u00d7 v& c}\u23a4\n\u23a2\n\u23a5 , B free (r, t ) = n\u02c6 \u00d7 E free (r, t ) ret\nc \u23a2\u23a3 (1 \u2212 n\u02c6 \u22c5 v c )3 r \u23a5\u23a6 ret\n\n[\n\n]\n\n(3)\n\nwhere all the quantities and positions have to be taken a t a retarded time t ' = t \u2212 r c and r\nrefers to the radius vector starting at the position of the particle and ending at the field\nposition. It is very important to note that the free fields diverge at most as 1 as we\nr\napproach the particle:\n1\n1\nE free \u23afr\u23af\n\u23af\u2192\nB free \u23afr\u23af\n\u23af\u2192 .\n\u21920\n\u21920\nr\nr\nIn this way, their norm and also their traditionally assigned energy content remain finite\nafter integration over space. We can say that this partition into attached and free fields is\nrelativistically invariant. The velocity fields transform among themselves, without\nmixing with the acceleration fields. Free and attached fields satisfy the equations:\n\u2207 \u22c5E free (r, t ) = 0\n\n\u2207 \u22c5B free (r, t ) = 0\n\n- 14 -\n\n\fr\n1 &\nE free (r, t ) = \u2212\u2207 \u00d7 B free (r, t ) + jE , free (r, t )\n2\nc\n\nB& free (r, t ) = \u2212\u2207 \u00d7 E free (r, t )\n\nand\n\u2207 \u22c5Eatt (r, t ) = 4\u03c0\u03c1\n\u2207 \u22c5B att (r, t ) = 0\n\nr\n1 &\n(\n)\nE\nr\n,\nt\n=\n\u2212\n\u2207\n\u00d7 B att (r, t ) + jE ,att (r, t )\n2 att\nc\n\nB& att (r, t ) = \u2212\u2207 \u00d7 Eatt (r, t )\n\nWhere we define\n\njiE , free (r, t ) = \u2211 \u222b jjE (r', t )\u03b4 i,free\nj (r \u2212 r')dr'\nj\n\nE , att\ni\n\nj\n\n(r, t ) = \u2211 \u222b jjE (r', t )\u03b4i,attj(r \u2212r')dr'\nj\n\nwhere \u03b4 (r \u2212 r') = \u03b4 i , j (r \u2212 r') \u2212 \u03b4 i,j (r \u2212 r') , in a similar way to the definition of the\ntransverse and longitudinal delta functions\natt\ni,j\n\nfree\n\nThese equations can be written in matricial form. The properties and symmetries of these\nmatrices are similar to those considered before for the Kemmer-Duffin-Harish-Chandra\nformalism [72], the only difference being that the sources are associated with the attached\nand free fields respectively.\nIn the dipole approximation, the terms proportional to the first time derivative of the\ndipole and the second time derivative of the dipole correspond to the velocity and\nacceleration fields found in the non-relativistic approximation. The term proportional to\nthe dipole corresponds to the deviation of the position of the charge from the origin of\ncoordinates. Here p (t ) represents the magnitude of the dipole at time t, assumed to point\nin the z direction, and to be located at the origin of the system of coordinates. We find\nthat the attached fields are:\n\u239b p(t - r/c ) p& (t - r/c ) \u239e\nEd ,att = \u239c\n+\n\u239f 2 cos(\u03b8 )r\u02c6 + sin (\u03b8 )\u03b8\u02c6 ,\n3\n2\nr\ncr\n\u239d\n\u23a0\np& (t - r/c )\nB d ,att =\nsin (\u03b8 )\u03c6\u02c6 ,\ncr 2\nand the free fields are:\n&p&(t \u2212 r c )sin (\u03b8 )\u03b8\u02c6\nEd , free =\nc 2r\n&p&(t \u2212 r / c )\nB d , free =\nsin (\u03b8 )\u03c6\u02c6\nc2r\n- 15 -\n\n(\n\n)\n\n\fIn order to find the source term for the radiation fields in the dipole approximation, we\nnotice that they are always perpendicular to the radius vector connecting the dipole with\nthe test point. Therefore, what we need is just the projection of the fields and the source\ninto the r-perpendicular direction. This is the same as the transverse delta function, but\nnow in r-space, this is\n\n\u03b4 i ,free\nj (r) = \u03b4 i , j (r) \u2212\n\nri rj\nr2\n\n.\n\nIV. THE SCHR\u0150DINGER-MAXWELL EQUATION\nIn this section, we propose a new scheme for the association of electrodynamics and\nquantum mechanics, by providing a combined Schr\u00f6dinger-Maxwell equation, defined in\na generalized configuration space. This space includes not only the traditional particles\nas electrons and protons, but also the photon particles as well. The generalized equation\nprovides a unified first quantized theory for all those particles in space.\nWe start with the observation that in traditional many-particle quantum mechanics in first\nquantization, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation reads\nr r \u23a4\n\u2202F (r1 , r2 ,..., rn ) \u23a1\n(4)\n= \u23a2\u2211 K\u02c6 i + \u2211 V\u02c6ij (ri , r j )\u23a5 F (r1 , r2 ,..., rn )\nih\n\u2202t\ni\ni\n,\nj\n\u23a3\n\u23a6\nwhere F (r1 , r2 ,..., rn ) is the wave function defined in configuration space. The\nr r\noperator \u2211 K\u02c6 + \u2211 V\u02c6 (r , r )is the Hamiltonian where the first term\ni\n\ni\n\nij\n\ni\n\nj\n\ni, j\n\n1\n= \u2211 mi \u2207 2r represents the sum over the kinetic energy of the particles, and the\ni\ni\ni 2\nr r\nsecond term \u2211 V\u02c6ij (ri , rj ) the sum over all interaction energies. The wave function can be\n\n\u2211 K\u02c6\n\ni\n\ni, j\n\nwritten, in general as the sum over products of the wave functions for individual\nparticles:\nF (r1 , r2 ,L rn ) =\n\n\u2211b\n\nstates\n\n\u03c8 i (r1 , t )\u03c8 j (r2 , t )L\u03c8 k (rn , t )\n\ni , jLk\n\n(5)\n\nComparison of eq. (1) and eq. (4) induces us to consider the identification of the photon\nhamiltonian H ph from eq. (1) with the photon kinetic energy and J (rph , t ) with the\nphoton interaction energy. This allows us to write a generalized wave equation as:\nih\n\n\u2202F (r1 , r2 ,L, rn , rph )\n\u2202t\n\n= H\u02c6 F (r1 , r2 ,L, rn , rph )\n\n(6)\n\nwhere F (r1 , r2 , L, rn , rph ) is the wave function defined in the generalized configuration\nspace and we define \u0124 as the Schr\u00f6dinger-Maxwell Hamiltonian\n- 16 -\n\n\f\u02c6 (r ) .\n=1\nK\u02c6 (r )+V\u02c6 (r ) + H\u02c6 (r ) + j\n3\n424\n3 144244\n\nH\u02c6\n\ne\n\ne\n\nph\n\nph\n\n(7)\n\nph\n\nMaxwell\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger\n\na sum of the Schr\u00f6dinger and the Maxwell operators, this last one in the Kemmer-DuffinHarish-Chandra formalism, where to simplify the notation, we have considered the\ninteraction of a single photon with an atomic system. For the wave function we write in\nanalogy with eq. (5) products of the form\nF (r1 , r2 ,L , rn , rph ) =\n\n\u2211b\n\nstates\n\n\u03c8 i (r1 , t )\u03c8 j (r2 , t )L\u03c8 k (rn , t )\u00d7\n\ni , j ,Lk ,l , m , n\n\n\u00d7 \u03a8lrad (rph1 , t )\u03a8mrad (rph 2 , t )L \u03a8nrad (rpho , t )\n\n(8)\n\nwhere now \u03c8 i (r1 , t )\u03c8 j (r2 , t )L\u03c8 k (rn , t ) represents the product of electron-wave-functions\nand \u03a8lrad (rph1 , t )\u03a8mrad (rph 2 , t )L \u03a8nrad (rpho , t ) the product of photon-wave-functions. In\nsupport of this model, we can mention that the Heisenberg equation of motion for the\nelectron-wave-function operator \u03c8\u02c6 (r, t ) in second quantization is identical with the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation for a single electron \u03c8 (r, t ) . Also, the Heisenberg equation of\n\u02c6 (r, t ) , in quantum electrodynamics, is\nmotion for the electromagnetic field operator \u03a8\nrad\n\nthe same as the Maxwell equations for the classical fields \u03a8rad (r, t ) in the Kemmer\nformalism as given in eq. (1). In the same way, the equation of motion for the product of\n\u02c6 (r, t ) will be given by\nthe operators \u03c8\u02c6 (r, t )\u03a8\nrad\n\nih\n\n(\n\n)\n\n\u02c6\n\u02c6 (r, t )\n\u2202 \u03c8\u02c6 (r, t )\u03a8\nrad\n\u02c6 (r, t )ih \u2202\u03c8\u02c6 (r, t ) +\u03c8\u02c6 (r, t )ih \u2202\u03a8rad (r, t ) =\n=\u03a8\nrad\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\n(\n\n)\n\n\u02c6 (r, t )H\u02c6 \u03c8\u02c6 (r, t ) + \u03c8\u02c6 (r, t )H\u02c6 \u03a8\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\n\u02c6 \u02c6\n\u02c6\n=\u03a8\nrad\nSchr\nph rad (r, t ) = H Schr + H ph \u03c8 (r, t )\u03a8rad (r, t )\n\n(9)\n\nwhere we have used the Heisenberg equation of motion for the operators \u03c8\u02c6 (r, t ) and\n\u02c6 (r, t ) and the fact that they commute at equal times. We can see that the expression\n\u03a8\nrad\n\nprovided by eq. (9) is the same as eq. (6) and eq. (7).\nThe photon-wave-functions appearing in eq. (8) can be free or attached. We can find\nterms of the form \u03a8l free (rphi , t )\u03a8matt (rphi , t ) , where both functions share the same photon\ncoordinate. The rule we are going to use is that free photon-wave-functions will\ncorrespond to the existence of real photons in space, fulfilling energy requirements, and\ntherefore multiplying electron states corresponding to the lower state of the transition\noriginating the emission of radiation. Attached states will be considered as belonging to\nthe real charged particle given rise to the fields. They will multiply both states\ncorresponding to the transition taking place.\n\n- 17 -\n\n\fThe solutions to equation (6) have their counterpart on the different states of radiation\nand matter in quantum optics. An important role in quantum optics is played by the so\ncalled vacuum states, namely the states of the radiation field with no photons present.\nWe will introduce the equivalent ot vacuum states also in our description provided by eq.\nfree\n(rph,null ) and \u03a8vacatt (rph,null ), where the\n(8). They will be given by terms of the form \u03a8vac\nfirst one corresponds to emitted fields and the second one to attached fields. The\ndifference will be that these functions are not associated with any real photon at all,\nfree\n(rph,null ) may\ntherefore they have an argument provided by rph ,null . The functions \u03a8vac\nappear multiplying the upper state of energy conserving transitions, or both states from\natt\n(rph,null ) will multiply both states of\nenergy non-conserving transitions. The functions \u03a8vac\nenergy non-conserving transitions. To exemplify the previous considerations, let's write\ndown the wave function for the case of a single electron and a single photon in the\nprocess of emission of radiation:\nfree\n(rph,null ) + b\u03c8 g (re , t )\u03a8radfree (rph , t ) \u03a8radatt (rph , t ) ,\nF (re ,rph , t ) = a\u03c8 e (re , t )\u03a8vac\n\n[\n\n]\n\nwhere \u03c8 e (re , t ) and \u03c8 g (re , t ) are the atomic excited and ground state respectively.\n\nWe will adopt for the fields the multipole expansion. We note that the adoption of the\nmultipole formalism is equivalent to the description provided by the Power-ZienauWooley transformation [118, 119]. We adopt this description because it removes the\nstatic longitudinal fields that are distinguishable from the oscillating fields, while\nmaintaining full causality. The static portion of the attached fields is automatically\nincluded in the Coulomb potential.\nNeglecting terms quadratic in the vector potential, eq. (6) can be written in more detail\nas:\n\u2202F\natt\n= H\u02c6 at + H\u02c6 I + H\u02c6 phfree + H\u02c6 ph\nih\nF\n\u2202t\natt\nwhere \u0124 at is the usual atomic Hamiltonian. The terms \u0124 phfree and \u0124 ph\nrepresent matrices\n\n(\n\n)\n\nfor free fields and attached fields, respectively. The interaction Hamiltonian \u0124 I has two\n\u02c6 + H\u02c6 , the first term j\n\u02c6 =j\n\u02c6 free + j\n\u02c6 att gives rise to the source current\nterms H\u02c6 = j\nI\n\nrad\n\nI , at\n\nrad\n\nrad\n\nrad\n\nappearing in the Maxwell's equations for the free and attached fields, and the second\nterm H\u02c6 I ,at corresponds to the standard interaction term in the particle Hamiltonian\ndiscussed in many text books. These two terms connect wave functions with free fields\nto wave functions with and without free fields, these last one in a similar way as the\ntheory by Landau and Peierls [69]. The explicit form for the source current will be\ndiscussed later in Section VI. For the second term, we propose the following form:\nH\u02c6 I ,at = \u2211 qipi \u22c5 A\u02c6 rph + A\u02c6 \u2020 rph \u03b4 ri \u2212 rph ,\n\n(( )\n\n( )) (\n\n)\n\ni\n\n- 18 -\n\n\fwhere A\u02c6 (rph ) + A\u02c6 \u2020 (rph ) represents the total (attached plus free) vector potential operators\n\nh\n\u2207 i is the usual momentum operator for the i -particle . The sum extends over\ni\nall charged particles with coordinates ri , and rph is the coordinate in configuration space\nassigned to the photon particle, the Dirac's delta ensures that the field is taken at the\nposition of the particle.\nand pi =\n\nThe photon-wave-functions, following the Kemmer-Duffin-Harish-Chandra formalism\n\u239b E(rph , t ) \u239e\n\u239c\n\u239f\n\u239c B(rph , t )\u239f\n\u239c A(r , t )\u239f\n\u239c ph \u239f\n\u239c \u03c6 (r , t )\u239f\nare given by \u03a8 (rph , t ) = \u239c ph \u239f and for the photon vacuum state we define\n\u239c 1 \u239f\n\u239c 1 \u239f\n\u239c\n\u239f\n\u239c 1 \u239f\n\u239c 1 \u239f\n\u239d\n\u23a0\n\u239b E(rph ,null , t ) \u239e\n\u239c\n\u239f\n\u239c B(rph ,null , t )\u239f\n\u239c A(r\n, t )\u239f\n\u239c ph ,null \u239f\n, t )\u239f\n\u239c \u03c6 (r\n\u03a8vac (rph ,null ) = \u239c ph ,null \u239f .

Because we define the norm as given\n\u2020\n\nexclusively by the free fields, this norm is finite and allows us to work inside the Hilbert\nspace with the photon-wave-functions.\nIn the case when an incident radiation field is present, the emission from the atomic\ndipole may present two components: one, which has the same frequency and is coherent\nwith the incident beam, and a second, which has a different frequency and therefore is\nincoherent with the incident beam. The photons belonging to the coherent component are\nindistinguishable from the photons from the incident beam. Therefore, they must have the\nsame coordinate as the photons from the incident beam. On the other hand, the\nincoherent photons are in principle distinguishable from the photons from the incident\nbeam; therefore, must have a different coordinate, not present in the incident beam.\n- 22 -\n\n\fAccordingly, the source equation can be separated in two, depending on the coherence\nproperties of the source. For the coherent emission we have:\nscat\nrphi , t\n\u2202\u03a8coh\nscat\n\u02c6 coh r , t\n= H\u02c6 phi \u03a8coh\nrphi , t + j\nih\nphi\n\u2202t\nr\nwhere rphi is the coordinate of a photon present in the incident beam, for the current\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\ndensity component at the same frequency as the incident field. This coherent scattering is\nthe responsible for refraction and reflection of optical beams as well as the diffraction and\nextinction of x-rays in crystals. On the other hand, for the incoherent emission we have\nscat\nrphs , t\n\u2202\u03a8inc\nscat\n\u02c6 inc r , t\n= H\u02c6 phs \u03a8inc\nrphs , t + j\nih\nphs\n\u2202t\nwhere rphs is a coordinate not present in the incident beam, for the current density\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\ncomponent at a different frequency than the incident beam. The incoherent current will\nbe the source for new photons created in the scattering process, absent from the original\nincident beam. In the presence of many photons we have:\n\u02c6 = j\nj\n\u2211 \u02c6 rphs = \u2211 j\u02c6 coh rphs + j\u02c6 inc rphs where j\u02c6 coh rphs = j\u02c6 rphs \u03b4 \u03c9 ,\u03c90 \u2211 \u03b4 is and\nrad\n\n( ( )\n\n( )\n\ns\n\n( ) ( )(\n\n( ))\n\n( ) ( )\n\ns\n\ni\n\n)\n\n\u239b\n\u239e\n\u02c6 inc r = j\n\u02c6 r 1\u2212 \u03b4\nj\n\u03c9 ,\u03c9 0 \u239c1 \u2212 \u2211 \u03b4 is \u239f if we assume the system is contained in a finite\nphs\nphs\ni\n\u239d\n\u23a0\nvolume and one can have a finite number of different frequencies. where \u03b4 \u03c9 ,\u03c90 is the delta\nfrom Kroenecker, which is equal to one if the scattered frequency equals the incident\nfrequency, and equal to zero otherwise. In the case of an incident beam with finite width\n\u2206\u03c9 , the \u03b4 \u03c9 ,\u03c9 0 can be replaced with the \u03b4 \u03c9 ,\u03c9 0 ,\u2206\u03c9 , which signifies those frequencies\nalready present in the spectrum of the incident beam. \u03b4 is is the delta from Kroenecker,\nwhich is equal to one if the scattered photon is one of the incident photons, and equal to\nzero if the scattered photon is newly created, namely was not present in the incident\nbeam.\nOne can assume that the photon mass is the parameter that can be used to define the\ndistinguishability of the photon. If radiation changes frequency because of scattering,\nthis will be reflected in its associated photon mass m = h\u03bd 2 . Therefore, one has to\nc\nchange the coordinates describing the scattered photon: it is not the same photon it was\nincident on the system, because its mass is different now.\nThe current density operator is given in matricial form by\n\n- 23 -\n\n\ft\n\u239b 0 0 0 0 jE 0 0 0 \u239e\n\u239bjE \u239e\n\u239f\n\u239c\n\u239c \u239f\nt\n\u239c 0 0 0 0 0 jB 0 0 \u239f\n\u239c jB \u239f\n\u239c 0 0 0 0 0 0 tj 0 \u239f\n\u239cj \u239f\nA\n\u239f\n\u239c\n\u239c A\u239f\n\u02c6 = \u239c\u239c 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u239f\u239f , so that j\n\u02c6 \u03a8 r = \u239c 0 \u239f provides precisely the\nj\nph\n\u239c0\u239f\nrad\n\u239c 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\u239f\n\u239c \u239f\n\u239c 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\u239f\n\u239c0\u239f\n\u239f\n\u239c\n\u239c \u239f\n\u239c 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\u239f\n\u239c0\u239f\n\u239c0\u239f\n\u239c 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\u239f\n\u239d \u23a0\n\u23a0\n\u239d\ncurrent densities needed for every field in the inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations.

Before going into the second task, we consider in the following Section the\ngeneralization to the case of many particles.\n\nV. GENERAL CASE, MANY PARTICLES\nA multi-particle multi-photon, nonlinear generalization for the Hamiltonian can be the\nfollowing:\nH\u02c6 = \u2211 12 m i \u2207 2ri + V\u02c6 (ri ) + \u2211 H\u02c6 phfree j + H\u02c6 phfree j +\n\n(\n\ni\n\n(\n\n)\n\nj\n\n{[\n\n{\n\n}\n\n)\n\n]\n\n}\n\nn\n+ \u2211 q \u2207 rii \u22c5 A\u02c6 \u2020j + A\u02c6 j + j\u02c6 rad ij \u03b4 (r phj \u2212 ri )\nn'\n\nn=0\ni, j\n\nacting on the functions\nF re1 , K ,re i , K ,re n ,r ph1 , K ,r ph j , K ,r ph n ' =\n\n(\n\n)\n\n=\n\nn ,n '\n\n\u2211\n\ni , j ,k = 0\n\n( )\n\n( ) \u03a8 (r )\n\nc ijk \u03c8 1 L \u03c8 i \u03a8 r ph1 1 L \u03a8 r ph j\n\nj\n\natt\n\nph j k\n\nwhere the i -sum runs over the different electron's coordinates, and the j -sum runs over\nthe different photon coordinates. This equation describes those cases where more than\n- 24 -\n\n\fone electron participate actively and coherently in the emission or absorption process,\nand on those cases of multi-photon emission or absorption, common in nonlinear optics.\nFor non-interacting, free particles the wave function must be properly symmetrized and\nantisymmetrized, following the postulates of indistinguishability of identical particles of\nquantum mechanics. In this way, the properly normalized wave function for bosons\nreads [120, 121]\nF =\n\n\u2211 P (\u03c8 (r\u03b1 )\u03c8 (r\u03b2 )L \u03c8 (r\u03c5 ))\n1\n\n2\n\nN\n\n(10)\n\nN ! n1 ! n 2 !L\n\nwhere \u03b1 , \u03b2 , L , \u03c5 are the different particles composing the system, 1, 2, ..., N are the\nstates where these particles can be found, the sum is performed over all possible\npermutations of the particle coordinates, and n1 , n 2 , L are the number of particles in\nstate 1, 2, ...; finally ! means the factorial as customary. We remark that this selection\nfor the normalization also provides the right expressions for absorption and spontaneous\nand stimulated emission in the case of the interaction of photons with matter [122]. We\nshould remember that in the case of photons, indistinguishability is assumed only for\nphotons having the same frequency, this is for photons inside the same energy shell\n[123]. This is consistent with the consideration of the photon mass as an observable able\nto distinguish between photons of different frequencies. Finally, we mention that in our\nmodel, we can provide an alternative interpretation for the symmetrized wave function\ngiven in eq. (10). Instead of recalling the principle of indistinguishability of identical\nparticles, we can equally well say that this expression is given as an initial condition for\nthe wave function generating entangled states with strong non-local correlations. In this\ncase, the Bose-Einstein distribution would not be a consequence of the\nindistinguishability of the particles, but of the correlations existing among them [124].\n\nIn the case of interacting particles, one cannot apply naively the symmetrization\npostulates as seen from the following considerations. The time derivative for any\nquantum mechanical operator is given by the commutator of this operator with the\nHamiltonian. Integration of that equation provides the time-dependence of that operator.\nIn the specific case of the creation and destruction operators for the electromagnetic field,\nthis time dependence will be a function of free space radiation operators and, in the\npresence of interaction with atomic systems, of atomic operators as well. The atomic\noperators are in general not boson operators. Therefore, the radiation operators after\ninteraction with matter have no more pure bosonic commutation properties. They present\na mixture of bosonic, fermionic and spin properties. Because of that, the photon-wavefunctions will not be strictly symmetrical. In general, the type of wave function will\ndepend on the process of creation of the photons and the indistinguishability of the\nphoton paths [125].\n- 25 -\n\n\fWe mention here, that one has the freedom, depending on the geometry and constraints of\nthe problem, to choose as independent variables, any linear combination of electron and\nphoton coordinates This will provide multiple possibilities for entanglement between\nelectron among themselves, between photons among themselves, and between electrons\nand photons. The possibility for the generation of entanglement differentiates our\napproach from semiclassical models, which provide no way for entanglement with\nphotons.\nFor isolated atoms, spherical symmetry is the most appropriate, and the techniques\ndeveloped in nuclear physics [126] and atomic physics [127] (for example the\nhyperspherical model) may be applied to find the solutions to the generalized wave\nequation, using the appropriate multi-particle functions for both, electrons and photons.\nFor laser beams impinging on nonlinear crystals, the use of cylindrical geometry might be\nmore useful, and the wave functions might depend on the sum and difference of photon\npositions, as is the case for the biphoton [128].\nIf we have more than one atom irradiated simultaneously by the same light beam, all\natoms may share the absorbed photon, and may start oscillating coherently in a collective\nfashion. In this case, the photon-wave-function may have sources on all atoms,\ngenerating 'induced' emission with directional properties, as in the case of an array of\nemitting antennas. This is the case of amplifying laser media and crystals, with\nrefraction and reflection at the interfaces. We can say that when the distance between\nscattering centers is larger than a wavelength, they are distinguishable for the incident\nradiation, and scattered photons have independent wave functions generating incoherent\nscattering. If the distance between scattering centers is shorter than a wavelength, they\nare indistinguishable for the incident radiation, generating coherent scattering.\n\nVI. ELECTRON AND PHOTON IN REAL SPACE\nHere we start with the second part of our work, namely we make the assumption that the\nelectron as a particle has real existence in space as in Bohmian's mechanics, and\nfurthermore we extend this assumption to the photons. We assume additionally that the\ntotal electromagnetic fields, and not the free electromagnetic fields alone, generate the\nguiding condition for the photons. In this way, we can reconcile the flux of energy in the\nparticle model with the classical Poynting vector. We will postulate that the photon\nvelocity is given by the speed of propagation of energy; this is the ratio between the\nPoynting vector and the electromagnetic energy density, as proposed by Wesley [129].\nThis approach assigns to the photon-particle the speed of light in vacuum, when it is far\nfrom any charged particle, but decreases from that value in the proximities of charges due\nto the presence of the scattered fields.\nA. Source currents in the generalized wave equation.\n\n- 26 -\n\n\fIn semiclassical models [13, 21], it is customary to take the source for the\nelectromagnetic fields as the current obtained from the Schr\u00f6dinger charge density, as\noriginally proposed by Schr\u00f6dinger himself [130] and showed to be incorrect by\nHeisenberg [131]. Instead, we propose here that the source currents are the real charged\nparticles actually present in space. We are induced to take this position after considering\nthe case of an ultra-relativistic electron approaching the earth from outer space. If we\ntake the electron-wave-function squared (e.g. the electron probability density) as the\nsource for the electromagnetic fields, it may cover a volume of perhaps galactic\ndimensions, generating an almost uniform density and electromagnetic fields of\nimmaterial magnitude. Any measurement however, will find the fields centered at the\nposition of the electron, with a strength equal to that of any particle confined to a given\nlocation on earth.\nh\n\u2207 i in the expression for\ni\nthe interaction atomic energy. This means, the electron wave function will react to an\nincoming electromagnetic wave, even in the case when the electron is not oscillating.\n\nWe remark however, that we keep the usual momentum pi =\n\nB Total fields. Guidance conditions.\n\nFrom the point of view of realistic theories for the electromagnetic field, there have been\nhistorically two approaches: the first one, due to Bohm [3, 132, 133, 134], and the second\nproposed by de Broglie [1, 2, 135, 136]. Bohm's approach considered the existence of a\n'super-potential' acting on the electromagnetic fields in all space, and not on the photon\nparticles. De Broglie approach considered the application of the guidance formula to\nspin-one-particles of finite mass, described by the Proca equation, but in the limit for\ninfinitesimally small mass. Independently of these models, Wesley [129] proposed that\nthe photon velocity should be given by the ratio between the Poynting vector and the\nenergy density, namely the group velocity or velocity with which energy propagates in a\nmedium.\nIn a nonrelativistic approximation, we will follow Wesley [129] who takes the guiding\nE\u00d7B\n, which can be shown to provide the\ncondition for the photon [137] as v ph = 2\nE + B2\ncorrect value for the velocity of propagation of the energy even in nonlinear crystals\n[138], and can be obtained by following the Kemmer-Duffin-Harish-Chandra formalism\n[139]. A relativistic generalization can be found by following the relativistic definitions\nof momentum and photon density [140, 141]. We can note however, that our model will\nprovide a very good approximation to the relativistic solution unless the source particle is\nmoving with a speed comparable with the speed of light. An important point is that the\nguiding condition is a function of the position of the photon and the position of the\nelectron as well, generating a nonlocal correlation or interaction among them.\n- 27 -\n\n\fWe define the guiding condition for the photon as a generalization of Wesley condition:\nr\nF * (re ,rph , t )(\u00d7ph )F(re ,rph , t )\nv ph =\n.\nF * (re ,rph , t )(\u2022 ph )F(re ,rph , t )\nr\nWhere we use the two operators (\u2022 ph ) and (\u00d7ph ) defined previously. In a sense similar to\nBohmian mechanics for electrons, one can associate with this guiding condition a photon\nquantum potential, generated by the electromagnetic fields, and responsible for the\nmotion of the photons. In some sense, the attached fields resemble sources of classical\npotentials because they are always associated to the particles generating them. However,\ntheir non-classical nature is manifested by the fact that they can interfere with the\nquantum fields generated by the free electromagnetic fields. We will define the\nabsorption of the photon, when its trajectory reaches the position of the source of the\nfield.\nOn the other hand, the Quantum Potential for the electron now reads:\n2\n1/ 2\nh 2 \u2207 re (F * (re ,rph , t )(\u2022 ph )F(re ,rph , t ) )\nQ(re ,rph , t ) = \u2212\n.\n2m (F * (re ,rph , t )(\u2022 ph )F(re ,rph , t ) )1/ 2\n\nwhere we make explicit use again of the operator (\u2022 ph ) . This equation is equivalent to\nthe Bohmian guiding condition:\nve (re ,rph , t ) =\n\nj(re ,rph , t )\n\n\u03c1 (re ,rph , t )\n\n.\n\nnamely the local current density divided by the particle density. In the presence of\nelectromagnetic fields the current density is given by [142]\neR 2\nh\nj=\n\u03c8 *\u2207\u03c8 \u2212 \u2207\u03c8 * \u03c8 \u2212\nA\nmc\n2mi\nwhere R 2 is the probability density and A the vector potential.\nWe can define an average velocity, smoothing out the variations in velocity amplitude\ngiven by the local value of the wave function, and consider the average over the volume\nwhere the particle is moving:\n\n[\n\n(\n\n)]\n\nv(re ,rph , t ) = \u222b v(re ,rph , t )\u03c1 (re ,rph , t )dre drph = \u222b\n\nj(re ,rph , t )\n\n\u03c1 (re ,rph , t )dre drph = \u222b j(re ,rph , t )dre drph .\n\u03c1 (re ,rph , t )\n\nIn the case where the wave function can be factorized as the product of an electron-wavefunction and a photon-wave-function, the integration over the photon coordinates gives\njust a normalization constant, and we are left with the value of the total current as given\nby the interaction matrix element in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The fields, which are\nproduced by the real currents, will follow on the average the distribution of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger fields. In the dipole approximation, both expressions should give practically\nthe same result.\nAt this point we have finished the description of our realistic model. In the following\nSection we will consider its application to a two level system.\n\n- 28 -\n\n\fVII. APPLICATION TO A TWO LEVEL SYSTEM\nIn order to illustrate the theory we have just exposed, we will apply it to the particular\ncase of one photon and a two-level hydrogen atom.\nBased on the order of magnitude of the masses involved in this problem, we can divide\nthe wave equation in two parts: one involving the proton and the electron, with its\nCoulomb interaction, and other involving the photon. The proton-electron part can be\nsolved first, and treat the photon interaction as a perturbation. This gives the traditional\nsolutions for the hydrogen atom, where the general solution can be represented as a\nm r + mere\nfunction of the atomic or center of mass coordinate rA = p p\nand the electronm p + me\nproton relative coordinate rE = re \u2212 rp . This is because the Coulomb interaction depends\nonly on the relative electron-proton coordinate, and not on them independently. Because\nthe proton mass is much larger that the electron mass, the position of the center of mass\npractically coincides with the position of the proton: rA \u2245 rp . Observation of the\nexpressions for the fields provided by eqs. (2) and (3) shows that the fields produced by\npoint particles do not depend on the absolute value of the field position, but only on the\nrelative position of the photon relative to the source, apart from time. This induce us to\ndefine rph = rfield \u2212 rA , where rfield is the absolute photon position, and rph the relative\nposition of the photon respect to the center of mass.\nIn the absence of external fields, the whole function for an excited atomic system can be\nwritten as:\n\n[\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)] (\n\n)\n\nF(re ,rph ,t ) = \u03a8A (rA , t ) a g (t )\u03c8 g (rE ,t )\u03a8 rph ,t + ae (t )\u03c8 e (rE , t )\u03a8vac rph,null \u03a8att rph ,t ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03a8A (rA , t ) is the wave function for the atomic coordinate, \u03c8 g (rE , t ) and \u03c8 e (rE , t ) are\nthe solutions of the unperturbed Hamiltonian corresponding to the ground state and\nexcited state respectively, \u03a8 (rph ,t ) is the field emitted by the atomic system,\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n\u03a8vac rph,null are the vacuum fields and finally \u03a8att rph ,t are the attached fields. This\n\nfunction shows explicitly entanglement between the photon states and the electron states.\nThe explicit analysis of the function \u03a8A (rA , t ) lies outside the scope of the present work.\nWe only emphasize that it is the responsible for the recoil of the atomic part after the\nphoton has been ejected, and in the absence of external forces, it would be of the form of\na plane wave. For a previous work on center of mass and recoil in spontaneous emission,\nsee the review by Stenholm [143] and references therein. The entanglement between the\nphoton and atomic system by recoil allows for the localization of photons to a region of\nthe order of the atomic size times the ratio between (atom mass) / (photon mass), for a\n- 29 -\n\n\fstudy of this effect in relation to the Schmidt decomposition, see the work by Eberly and\ncoworkers [144].\nIn our model, the center of mass coordinate has a real existence, and follows a trajectory\ndetermined by the guiding condition for the atomic wave function \u03a8A (rA , t ) . The other\nparticles, including the photon, follow a guiding condition provided as a function of their\nrelative location to the center of mass, rE and rph . The total force suffered by the\nparticles is then the sum of that provided to the relative coordinate plus the forces acting\non the center of mass.\nIn the presence of external radiation fields, we assume the wave function to be given by\nF(re ,rph ,t ) = \u03a8A (rA , t )(a g (t )\u03c8 g (rE ,t ) + ae (t )\u03c8 e (rE ,t ))\u03a8rad (rph ,t )\u03a8att (rph ,t )\n\nas long as the atomic system is exposed to the incident fields. Here \u03a8rad (rph ,t ) represents\nthe incident and scattered fields. After the incident wave has moved away from the\nsystem, this is left in the ground state if no photon has been absorbed by the atom, or it\nmay be left in the state described by eq. (11) above in the case when a photon has been\nabsorbed by the system.\nWhen a photon is absorbed, the atom starts moving because of conservation of\nmomentum. As a result, the amount of energy available for the internal oscillation\ndecreases, and with it the frequency of the emitted radiation. This makes the emitted\nphoton distinguishable from the incident one, and therefore must have a new coordinate\nin the new wave function. The scattered photon will be incoherent with the incident\nbeam and will not suffer interference with it. This is the Compton effect.\nA. Lamb shift and spontaneous emission.\nSemiclassical models\n\nIn traditional quantum optics, one can obtain the correct value for the Lamb shift [145],\naccompanied by an exponential decay of the excited state given by spontaneous emission,\nwhile preserving the norm of the state describing the complete system. In semiclassical\ntheories, this cannot be achieved. In fact, spontaneous emission and the Lamb shift have\nbeen considered in the semiclassical works by Jaynes and collaborators [13] and by Barut\nand collaborators [21]. Both approaches have problems: Jaynes' work preserves\nnormalization, but has not an exponential decay. In Barut's work, the electromagnetic\nfields are allowed to take on complex values, renouncing to the unitarity of the\nHamiltonian [146] and precluding the constancy of the norm of the solutions. The ground\nstate is found stable, while excited states decay towards zero. It can be verified that these\nsolutions have not a constant norm by considering the case where the initial state consists\nof an equal amount of the upper and lower states. After a few lifetimes, the excited state\ndecays, and the system is left in the ground state, with a total norm equal to half of the\n- 30 -\n\n\foriginal one. In relation to the exponential decay of vectors in Hilbert space, see\nReference [147] where the Gamow vectors are discussed.\nA third semiclassical approach is given by stochastic quantum electrodynamics [148].\nHere the vacuum fields are assumed to generate forces on the radiating electron, which\nadd to the radiation reaction forces for downward transitions. For upward transitions, the\nvacuum fields and the radiation reaction forces cancel each other, preventing the\ngeneration of a transition that otherwise would not conserve energy.\nAnother approach providing the right value for the Lamb shift is given by the dispersion\nforces formalism, which works with the equations generated by two requirements. The\nfirst requirement is of self-consistency: the fields seen by the particle must be the same as\nthe fields generated by the particle [149]. The second requirements is that the energy\nchange in the system generated by the interaction between matter and radiation should be\ngiven by \u2206E = \u2211 h\u2206\u03c9 i , where the sum has to be performed over the atomic and\nradiation frequency shifts. In this model, one assumes that the real and imaginary parts\nof the vector potential represent the components in phase and out of phase with respect to\nthe electron motion, as it is customary in any classical calculation using complex notation\nfor electric fields. There is no way to generate an exponential decay. Possible solutions\nare periodical or steady. Steady solutions can be found by diagonalization of the\nHamiltonian [150], which is always possible, independently from the phase between the\nvelocity and the vector potential [151], and therefore also in the presence of self-fields.\nWe note that our model can clarify and justify the results of the dispersion forces\nformalism. In fact, a steady state is possible also under the consideration of radiation\nreaction fields, because the quantum potential cancels the forces that are out of phase\nwith the dipole moment, preventing them from exerting any work on the particle. We\nnotice also that the Schr\u00f6dinger-Maxwell equation without interaction splits in two parts\ncorresponding to the Schr\u00f6dinger and the Maxwell equations respectively. In the absence\nof interaction, the total energy is given by E = \u2211 h\u03c9 i ; with interaction the change in\nenergy has to be the sum in the changes of frequencies: \u2206E = \u2211 h\u2206\u03c9 i , providing the\n\nsecond equation required by the theory of dispersion forces.\nOur model\n\nIn this work, we propose a new model for spontaneous emission based on the\nentanglement between the photon and atomic wave functions. Because of that\nentanglement, the atom decays to the ground state and the electron stops oscillating when\nthe photon leaves the atom. Taking a constant probability per unit time for photon\nemission, one obtains an exponential distribution of lengths for the photon-wavefunctions, which in turn generates a Lorentzian Fourier distribution in frequency space.\nThis model can be generalized to include collisions and other perturbations [152].\n- 31 -\n\n\fExplicitly, we are going to consider an excited state with no photons, and a ground state\nwith one photon. Neglecting the center of mass coordinate, and taking the proton to be at\nrest, the wave function can be written as:\n\n(\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n) ( )\n\nF(re ,rph ,t ) = ae (t )\u03c8 e (re ,t )\u03a8vac rph,null + a g (t )\u03a8 rph ,t \u03c8 g (re ,t ) \u03a8 att rph .\n\n(12)\n\nThe generalized wave equation in the Coulomb gauge can be split into several parts as\nfollows:\n\u2202\u03c8 e\n= \u2207 r2e\u03c8 e + V (re )\u03c8 e\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c8 g\n= \u2207 r2e\u03c8 g + V (re )\u03c8 g\n\u2202t\nwhich are the unperturbed Schr\u00f6dinger equations for the excited and ground states. In the\nCoulomb gauge, the photon-wave-functions \u03a8 (rph ,t ) and \u03a8vac (rph,null ) give rise to\nequations of the form\n\u239b E \u239e \u239b \u2207 \u00d7 B \u239e \u239b jE \u239e\n\u239f \u239c \u239f\n\u2202 \u239c \u239f \u239c\n\u239cB \u239f = \u239c \u2207 \u00d7E\u239f + \u239c 0 \u239f\n\u2202t \u239c \u239f \u239c\n\u239f \u239c \u239f\n\u239dA\u23a0 \u239d E \u23a0 \u239d 0 \u23a0\nwhich are just the usual Maxwell equations. The current densities are given by the real\nelectron motion. Due to the large ratio between the atomic radius and the photon\nwavelength, and assuming that the electron speed is much less than the speed of light, we\ncan use the dipole approximation in order to find the solution to the Maxwell equation.\nAssuming real photon fields, the solution to the photon equation gives approximately\n[153]\n\u03a8 (rph ,t ) = \u03a8 0 (rph )\u0398(rph \u2212 ct )e \u2212i\u03c9 0t + cc ,\n\nwhere \u03a8 0 (rph ) is a function depending only on the photon coordinate and\n\u0398(rph \u2212 ct ) preserves causality.\n\nAt this point, we are ready to show that the 'quantum jumps' associated with the emission\nof radiation have their origin in the atom-photon entanglement, and in the existence of\nmaterial particles and photons. The electron quantum potential is given by:\n\n[\n\n]\n\n*\nh 2 \u2207 re F (re ,rph , t )(\u2022 ph )F(re ,rph , t )\nQ(re ,rph , t ) = \u2212\n2m F* (re ,rph , t )(\u2022 ph )F(re ,rph , t ) 1/ 2\n2\n\n[\n\n1/ 2\n\n]\n\n,\n\nwith the wave function F(re ,rph , t ) given by eq. (12), and the definition of the operator\n\n(\u2022 ), it takes the form\nph\n\n2\n\n[{\n\n(\n\n)} {\n)} {\n*\n\n(\n\n)}]\n\n1/ 2\n\natt\nfree\natt\no ae\u03c8 eG att + a g \u03c8 g G free + G att\nh 2 \u2207 re ae\u03c8 eG + a g \u03c8 g G + G\nQ(re ,rph , t ) = \u2212\n1/ 2\n*\n2m\nae\u03c8 eG att + a g \u03c8 g G free + G att o ae\u03c8 eG att + a g \u03c8 g G free + G att\n\n[{\n\n(\n\n- 32 -\n\n(\n\n)}]\n\n\f(13)\n\nwhere we have defined G att = E att + B att and G free = E free + B free , and where the product o\nrepresents the usual dot product between vectors in space, but removing terms of the\nform E \u22c5 B , retaining only terms of the form E 2 and B 2 . It is important to realize that the\nattached fields are shared by the ground state and the excited state. In addition, the\nattached fields are much larger than the free fields at a distance closer than one\nwavelength, while the free fields are much larger at distance larger than one wavelength,\nnamely:\nG att >> G free\nif r < \u03bb\natt\nfree\nG << G\nif r > \u03bb ,\nwith \u03bb the radiation wavelength. As a result, when the photon is close to the atom, and\nthe attached fields are dominating, eq. (13) reduces to\n\n[\n\n]\n\natt\natt\nh 2 \u2207 re {ae\u03c8 e + a g \u03c8 g }G o {ae\u03c8 e + a g \u03c8 g }G\nQ(re ,rph , t ) = \u2212\n2m {a \u03c8 + a \u03c8 }G att * o {a \u03c8 + a \u03c8 }G att 1/ 2\n2\n\n[\n\ne\n\n1/ 2\n\n*\n\ne\n\ng\n\ng\n\ne\n\ne\n\ng\n\nwhere the attached fields can be simplified to give\n\n[\n\n]\n\nh 2 \u2207 re {ae\u03c8 e + a g \u03c8 g } {ae\u03c8 e + a g \u03c8 g }\nQ(re ,rph , t ) = \u2212\n2m {a \u03c8 + a \u03c8 }* {a \u03c8 + a \u03c8 }1/ 2\n2\n\n[\n\ne\n\n1/ 2\n\n*\n\ne\n\ng\n\ng\n\n]\n\ng\n\ne\n\ne\n\ng\n\ng\n\n]\n\n.\n\nThe photon coordinate has disappeared from the quantum potential. Consequently, the\n* r\nae \u03c8 e + a g \u03c8 g \u2207 ae \u03c8 e + a g \u03c8 g\n, and the average\nelectron motion is determined by v =\n*\nae \u03c8 e + a g \u03c8 g ae \u03c8 e + a g \u03c8 g\n\n(\n\n) (\n)(\n\n(\n\n)\n\n)\n\nvelocity is given by v = a *g ae \u222b \u03c8 *g \u2207\u03c8 e d 3re + cc , the same result as obtained by\nsemiclassical theories.\nOn the other hand, once the photon has moved at a distance larger than a wavelength, the\nfree fields predominate over the attached fields. As a result, eq. (13) reduces to:\n\n(\n\n)\n\nh 2 \u2207 re (a g \u03c8 g ) (a g \u03c8 g )\nQ(re ,rph , t ) \u2245 \u2212\n2m (a \u03c8 )* (a \u03c8 ) 1/ 2\n2\n\n(\n\ng\n\n1/ 2\n\n*\n\ng\n\ng\n\ng\n\n)\n\nwhich is the potential generated by the ground state alone and consequently, the average\nvelocity is v = 0 as shown in Bohmian mechanics [154]. The passage of the photon\nfrom a region dominated by attached fields to a region dominated by free fields (or vice\nversa) takes place over a period of the order of the inverse of the optical frequency\ninvolved in the transition. This passage generates an abrupt change in the quantum\npotential seen by the electron that can be identified with the experimentally observed\nquantum jumps. As soon as the photon leaves the atom and reaches a distance larger than\na wavelength, the electron 'sees' only the ground state function and stops its motion, and\nthe atom remains in its ground state irreversibly. The electromagnetic wave has no more\n- 33 -\n\n\foscillating sources and vanishes soon behind the photon. This model explains the\ntemporal behavior in experiments performed by Clauser [155], ant the antibunching\neffect [99].\nAs previously noted, our model has similitude with the original Slater model [5, 8],\nwhere the atom was assumed to emit 'ghost' or virtual fields while in the excited state.\nThose ghost fields were generated by virtual oscillators and propagated in space as the\nclassical electromagnetic fields. As soon as the quantum jump occurred, and the photon\nwas emitted, the atom stopped emitting those fields. The original Slater model was\neventually abandoned in favor of the so-called Bohr-Kramers-Slater model [156], where\nthe photon particle was removed, surviving only the notion of statistical processes\ninduced by virtual oscillators and virtual fields. This was done before the introduction of\nwave functions and the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in quantum mechanics.\nThe equations for the coefficients read:\n\u2202a e\n= a g \u222b A (re ) \u22c5 \u03c8 e* (re )\u2207 re\u03c8 g (re ) d re (re ) \u2245 a g A self (r = 0 , t ) \u22c5 p eg\n\u2202t\nand\n\u2202a g\n= a e \u222b A (re ) \u22c5 \u03c8 g* (re )\u2207 re\u03c8 e (re ) d re (re ) \u2245 a e A self (r = 0 , t ) \u22c5 p ge\n\u2202t\nwhere we have assumed that the photon-wave-functions are normalized to unity. In the\nabsence of external fields, the transverse vector potential due to the self-field at the\nposition of the atom has been calculated both, semi classically [157] and fully quantum\nmechanically to be (in complex notation) [158, 159]\nq v (t )\u03c9 0 \u23a1\n2 \u239b mc 2 \u239e \u23a4\n\u239f\u23a5\n+\nln \u239c\ni\nA self (r = 0 , t ) =\n\u23a2\n6 \u03c0\u03b5 0c 3 \u23a3\n\u03c0 \u239c\u239d h \u03c9 0 \u239f\u23a0 \u23a6\nE \u2212 Eg\n, and the real and imaginary parts represent the in phase and out of\nwhere \u03c9 0 = e\nh\nphase components of the self field respectively. It is interesting to remark that the\nmagnitude of the self-fields is the same as the magnitude of dipole fields at a distance of\nabout a wavelength from the origin.\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\nSimilarly to the dispersion fields model, we look for steady solutions to these equations\nthat can be obtained by diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. In those solutions, the effect\nof the self-fields is not to induce the decay of the oscillations as in the Jayne's and\nBarut's models, but to provide the right phase difference between the atomic wave\nfunctions and the electromagnetic wave. The choice for steady solutions allows for a\nconstant probability per unit time for photon emission, and therefore for a Lorentzian\nFourier distribution in frequency space, as previously mentioned.\nWhen one considers not just a two level system, but allows for coupling between all\natomic levels, this procedure provides the correct value for the Lamb shift. One can state\n- 34 -\n\n\fthat a self-sustained state of oscillation is achieved, as equilibrium between the quantum\nforces and the radiation reaction forces is realized. Because of the coupling through all\npossible transitions, the electron motion acquires an additional drifting, filling up the\nspace surrounding the nucleus with a probability proportional to the square of the\nmagnitude of the wave function, in a similar way as proposed by stochastic\nelectrodynamics. Indeed, those random motions generate electromagnetic fields very\nsimilar to the customary vacuum fields described in stochastic electrodynamics.\nB. Scattering, absorption, dispersion and resonance fluorescence\n\nThe processes of photon scattering and resonance fluorescence are described in quantum\noptics by the Bloch equations for the density matrix [160 60]. In our model, we don't\nneed to add ad hoc decay terms, because spontaneous emission is described by the\ncombined dynamics of the wave functions and the particles of the system. It is well\nknown that when the transitions produced by the quantum jumps are incorporated into the\nequations, we recover the Bloch equations [104, 105, 106].\nThe classical equations of motion for a dipole in the presence of an external field describe\ntwo independent degrees of freedom: the amplitude and velocity of the dipole. On the\nother hand the Bloch equations are describing a physical system with three degrees of\nfreedom [161]: two representing the electric dipole as in classical electrodynamics, plus\nanother one, representing the wave function through the atomic inversion. Our model\nexplains automatically this third degree of freedom because our system is composed not\nonly by the particle, but also by the wave function, which follows the generalized wave\nequation. The wave function interacts with the particle through the quantum potential. In\nthe case of resonance fluorescence, the solution to the Bloch equations describes a timedependent phase difference between the oscillating dipole and the incident field. From a\npurely classical point of view, there is no obvious way to explain this behavior. From our\nmodel, we can verify that the phase of the dipole is modified periodically by the quantum\npotential in just the right way to generate the Rabi oscillations.\n1. One photon\n\nLet's consider an incident electromagnetic wave for a single photon, on a two-level atom\nfrom the standpoint of our model. As shown by the dispersion forces model and the\nsemiclassical Floquet theory as described by Shirley [162], due to the atom-radiation\ninteraction, eigenstates of the atom and radiation system are different from the eigenstates\nthey had when they were far apart. As a result, the system enters a state, which is not an\neigenstate of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. It is of the form\natom\nrad\nF = (a\u03c8 atom\n\u03a8att\nground + b\u03c8 excited )\u03a8\natom\nwhere \u03c8 atom\nground and \u03c8 excited are the eigenstates of the atomic system in the absence of the\n\nincident radiation and similarly, the radiation field is the sum of the incident and the\nscattered fields \u03a8 rad = \u03a8 inc + \u03a8 scatt . The coefficients a and b are determined by the\n- 35 -\n\n\fcondition that the frequency of the system remains equal to the frequency of the incident\nphoton in vacuum.\nThis model is not equivalent to the dressed states model [163] because of the presence of\nrad\nthe second term b\u03c8 atom\n. In fact, the dressed state corresponding to this situation is\nexcited \u03a8\ngiven by [164] F = a g ,1 + b e,0 , where the atomic excited state appears only in the\nabsence of radiation. From the very beginning, we are considering the system in a\ndynamical state, and as a result, we don't need to postulate that the electromagnetic field\nis in a Glauber coherent state, as one is forced to do in order to derive the Bloch\nequations in the dressed atom approach [163]. In fact, we are considering here that the\nfield state is the equivalent to a one-photon-state in quantum optics.\nThe real existence of these mixed states has been signaled by some authors [165]. The\nrad\nincorporation in the system of terms proportional to \u03c8 atom\nplays also a central part in\nexcited \u03a8\nthe polaron-exciton description of the index of refraction in crystals. In fact, in\nHopfield's model for the index of refraction [166], the basic crystal states are taken to be\nthe quantized modes of the atomic crystal, implying that even in the ground state,\ncollective oscillations of the atomic charges exist, generating a finite dynamical atomic\npolarization.\nrad\nWe remark here that the inclusion of the term b\u03c8 atom\ndoes not imply a violation to\nexcited \u03a8\nthe law of conservation of energy. The radiation field is not equal to the field in vacuum:\nit includes the scattered fields and as a consequence, its energy contains decreases. This\ndecrease in the photon energy is employed by the atomic system to include the wave\nfunction from the excited state and to stay in oscillation. A similar process occurs in the\nclassical scattering of radiation, where part of the energy of the incident field is shared by\nthe scattered fields and the scattering center. This effect can be more clearly seen in a\ncrystal, where the equivalent to the photonic kinetic energy given by the H\u02c6 ph (rph ) term in\n\neq. (7) diminishes as a result of the increase in wavelength produced by the index of\nrefraction. Even in the case of high intensity fields, the atomic system can perform\ncoherent Rabi oscillations without the need for absorbing a photon. The energy needed\nfor the excitation of the system can be provided by the full set of photons keeping the\nchange in energy for every individual photon very small. In this way, one can explain not\nonly the index of refraction, but also all nonlinear coherent effects associated with the\npropagation of pulses in transparent materials, which are adequately explained by\nsemiclassical theories without the need for radiation quantization [167].\nIt can be shown that this theory provides the same energy levels as those predicted by a\nfull quantum electrodynamics treatment [168, 169].\n\n- 36 -\n\n\fIf we are not concerned with the motion of the atom, we can rewrite the solution to the\ngeneralized wave equation for an atom in the presence of a single incident photon field in\nmore detail as:\nF(re ,rph ,t ) = {a g (t )\u03c8 g (re ,t ) + ae (t )\u03c8 e (re ,t )}\u03a8 rad (rph ,t )\u03a8att (rph ,t ) .\nThe equations for the coefficients ae and a g follow traditional perturbation theory. One\nhas to be careful to include the self-fields from the charged particles in the definition of\nthe total fields as in the previous case of spontaneous emission and Lamb shift. It is\nimportant also to analyze when the incident radiation field should be considered as an\nadiabatic or as a sudden perturbation [170, 171, 172]. In the adiabatic case, one is\ndealing with a static approximation [173], where the system follows that eigenstate of the\nenergy, which evolved from the initial state. This case applies to low intensity fields or\nfrequencies far from the atomic frequencies. It gives rise to dispersion and the index of\nrefraction. In the sudden case, one is in the presence of a dynamical [174] evolution\ngenerating oscillations at the Rabi frequency [48]. This case applies in resonance\nfluorescence; in this case, the main result of the excitation is the incoherent scattering of\nradiation. This effect is strictly related to the distinguishability of the emitted photon\n[175]. In both cases, the effect of the self-fields is not to induce the decay of the\noscillation, but to provide the right phase difference between the atomic wave functions\nand the incident wave. This phase difference in turn, will provide the probability that an\nincoming photon be absorbed by the atomic system and will provide the introduction of\nthe damping constant into the solutions of the problem. Transitions between wave\nfunctions with different number of photons take place in our model, only when a photon\nis physically absorbed or emitted by the atomic system.\nFar from resonance, the equation for the incident photon reads, on the average:\n\u2202\u03a8 rad (rph ,t ) \u02c6\n= H ph\u03a8 rad (rph ,t ) + ae*a g \u222b \u03c8 *g \u2207 e\u03c8 e d 3 re .\n\u2202t\nWithout considering numerical factors of order one, the net power exchange between the\nincident fields and the dipole through integration over a closed surface of Si is classically\ngiven by the work done on the dipole Pcl \u2248 evE . Solution of the classical equation of\nmotion for an oscillator of natural frequency \u03bd 0 gives for the amplitude of the steady\nEe / m\n. Here \u03b3 is proportional to the damping force produced\nstate oscillation x = 2\n\u03bd 0 \u2212 \u03bd 2 \u2212 i\u03bd\u03b3\n2 e 2\u03bd 02\n. At resonance, the velocity is given by\n3 mc 3\n3 Ec 3\n3 E 2c 3 3 2 2\nand the power by Pcl \u2248\n= E c\u03bb , which defines the cross\nv \u2245 \u03bdx =\n2 \u03bd2\n2\n2 e\u03bd 2\n2\nsection in resonance as roughly \u03bb . These classical solutions reproduce the main features\nof the quantum mechanical solution including the self-fields of the electron for\nby the reaction fields and is given by \u03b3 =\n\n- 37 -\n\n\ffrequencies far from the resonance frequency and even at resonance for low beam\nintensities..\nFrom the steady state solution for x , we can see that for photons with an energy lower\nthan the transition energy, the phase shift is negative, while for higher energies, it is\npositive. Simulations of the photon paths for an incident beam on an atomic system\nunder the dipole approximation are shown in Figures 1 and 2. The simulations show, that\nfor a positive phase shift between the incident and scattered fields, the photons are\nabsorbed by the dipole, some of them may perform a few orbits before reaching the\ndipole position. On the contrary, for a negative phase shift, the photons are being\nrepelled by the dipole fields. This means that for photons with an energy lower than the\ntransition energy, the fields are repulsive, preventing the photons from reaching the atom.\nFor higher energies, the fields are attractive, allowing the photons to be absorbed by the\natom, which agree with the intuitive view that only photons with enough energy can be\nabsorbed by the system.\nIn the case of resonance fluorescence, the phase difference between the oscillating dipole\nand the incident beam is a function of time, determining the sign of the work done by the\nexternal fields. When the Bloch state vector is moving up, the fields do work over the\natom, this last one absorbing energy, and the photons are allowed to be absorbed. When\nthe Bloch state vector is moving down, the atom is delivering energy and photons to the\nfields. Obviously, incoherently scattered photons may be emitted at any time.\n2. N-photons\n\nDirac showed in his 1927 paper [66] that a proper symmetrization and normalization of\nthe photon-wave-function automatically generates the correct expressions for stimulated\nabsorption and stimulated and spontaneous emission. If we have n -external incident\nphotons, we can write the wave function as\ninc\n+\nF(re ,rph1 , L,rphn , t ) = (a g \u03c8 gn + ae\u03c8 en )\u03a8ninc \u03a8att\n\ninc\n+ \u2211 \u03a8ninc\u2212i (aei\u03c8 en \u22121\u03a8 vac + a gi\u03c8 gn \u22121\u03a8ninc\u2212i (\u03a8sscatt + \u03a8iscatt ))\u03a8att\n, n \u22121\ni\n\nwhere the first term is present as long as no photon has been absorbed, and the second\nterm appears once an incoming photon has been trapped by the atomic system. Here\n\u03a8ninc (rph 2 ,L ,rphn ,t ) is the wave function for n incident photons, and \u03c8 gn (re ,t ) and\n\n\u03c8 en \u22121 (re ,t ) are the electron-wave-functions for the ground state and the excited state in the\n\npresence of n and n \u2212 1 incident photons respectively. These wave functions differ\nslightly from the naked \u03c8 g (re ,t ) and \u03c8 e (re ,t ) and their energy has a shift known as the\n\n(\n\n)\n\nAC Stark effect. Here \u03a8 iscatt rphi ,t is the wave function for a photon with coordinate rphi ,\nwhose source will be different from zero only if the atom is oscillating at the same\n- 38 -\n\n\ffrequency as the incident field. This photon is coherent with the incident beam and\nindistinguishable from the incident photons; the coordinate rphi is one of the coordinates\n\n(\n\n)\n\npresent in the incident beam. Similarly \u03a8 sscatt rphs ,t as the wave function for a newly\ncreated photon with coordinate rphs , whose source is the incoherent atomic current\ngenerated if the atom is in a state which is oscillating at a different frequency than the\nincident beam. This photon is incoherent with the incident beam and distinguishable\nfrom the incident photons; the coordinate rphs is absent from the incident beam. \u03a8ninc\u2212i is\nthe normalized wave function of n \u2212 1 variables when the photon i is missing. \u03a8ninc\u22121 is the\nnormalized wave function for the incident photons, when one photon has been physically\nabsorbed by the atomic system. Its explicit form is given by:\nn\nn\n\u03a8\n\u03a8 (r1 ,L ,ri-1 ,ri +1 ,K ,rn ,t )\n\u03a8 n \u22121 = \u2211 n \u2212 i = \u2211\nn\nn\ni =1\ni =1\nwhere the sum runs over all the initially incident photons. One can verify explicitly that\nthe n terms correctly gives the single photon cross section as 1 fraction of the total\nn\ncross section as provided by the Bloch equations [176], and the total scattered intensity is\nn times the intensity scattered per photon.\nIn order to generate the antibunching effect, we postulate that terms of the form\nr\nr\na gij \u03c8 en \u03a8 scatt (rph1 )\u03a8 scatt (rph 2 )\u2211 \u03a8ninc\u2212i \u2212 j where we have two scattered photons and the atom in\ni, j\n\nthe ground state, and \u03a8\n\nscatt\n\n\u2211a \u03c8\nei\n\nn\u22122\ne\n\n\u03a8ninc\u2212i where we have one scattered photon and the\n\ni\n\natom in the excited state are null until the first scattered photon particle is actually\nemitted. This is in agreement with the theories of multiphoton emissions [177] and\nquantum jumps.\n\nVIII. RELATIVISTIC GENERALIZATION\nIn this Section, we consider a relativistic generalization of our model and we discuss its\nrelationship with quantum electrodynamics or QED.\nThe first step to generalize the Schr\u00f6dinger-Maxwell equation is to replace the\nSchr\u00f6dinger part by the Dirac expression. The next step is to verify that the single\nparticle wave equations show a relativistic covariance and that the equation of motion for\nthe electron and photon particles leads to a relativistic four-current expressions. Finally,\nthe multi-particle formalism can be recovered as in the case of relativistic QED, through\na multi-time formalism.\nWe start by repeating the generalized wave equation\n- 39 -\n\n\f\u2202F (r1 , r2 ,L, rn , rph )\n\n= H\u02c6 FDM (r1 , r2 ,L, rn , rph )\n\u2202t\nwhere now the generalized Dirac-Maxwell Hamiltonian corresponds to the addition of\nthe Dirac operators for electrons [178] and the Maxwell operator for photons,\ncorresponding to free fields and attached fields as discussed in the previous Sections.\n2\n\u02c6 free\n\u02c6 att\n\u02c6 att\nH\u02c6 DM = \u03b2mc + c\u03b1 \u22c5[p\u02c6 - qA(r)]+ qV (r) + + H\u02c6 phfree (rph ) + j\nph ) + H ph (rph ) + j (rph )\n244444443\n144424443 1444444(r4\nMaxwell\nDirac\nThe electron part as provided by the Dirac equation implies a four-current density given\nby [179]\nj \u03bc \u2261 \u03c8 \u03b3 \u03bc\u03c8 = (\u03c8 \u2020\u03c8 ,\u03c8 \u2020\u03b1\u03c8 )\nwhere the \u03b3 \u03bc are the so-called relativistic Dirac matrices. Because the Dirac equation is\nrelativistically invariant, and the four-current density corresponds to the assumed motion\nof the real electron particles, they are relativistic as desired. In fact, it can be shown that\nthis current density is equivalent to the relativistic guiding condition for electrons [180].\nih\n\nThe relativistic invariance of the photon operator H\u02c6 ph (rph ) was confirmed by many\nauthors [72], and which is obvious because it is simply a formatted expression for the\nMaxwell equations. The division between free and attached fields, where the free fields\nare given by the acceleration fields, and the attached fields by the velocity fields is a\nrelativistic partition as can be seen by writing the corresponding field-strength tensors in\nexplicit covariant form [181]:\ne 1\n\u03bc\u03bd\n(x \u2212 z )\u03bc &z&\u03bd R \u2212 (x \u2212 z )\u03bd &z&\u03bc R \u2212 (x \u2212 z )\u03bc z&\u03bd Q + (x \u2212 z )\u03bd z& \u03bc Q\n=\nF free\n4\u03c0 R 3\nand\ne 1\n(x \u2212 z )\u03bc z&\u03bd \u2212 (x \u2212 z )\u03bd z& \u03bc\nFatt\u03bc\u03bd =\n3\n4\u03c0 R\nwhere\n\n[\n\n[\n\n]\n\n]\n\n\u03c3\nR = ( x \u2212 z ) z&\u03c3 ,\n\n\u03c3\nQ = ( x \u2212 z ) &z&\u03c3 ,\n\nx \u03bc is the fixed field world-point and z \u03bc (s ) is the source world-point describing the\nposition of the moving charge as a function of the proper time s , and z& \u03bc (s ) is the fourvelocity of the particle.\nThe photon velocity is described by the zero-components of the symmetric stress tensor\nfor electromagnetic radiation \u0398ij , which define a relativistic four-vector equivalent to the\nelectromagnetic energy density and the Poynting vector [182]:\n- 40 -\n\n\f1\n(E 2 + B 2 ) = u\n8\u03c0\n1\n(E\u00d7 B) = cg\n\u0398 0i =\n4\u03c0\nwhere u is the electromagnetic energy density and S = c 2g is the Poynting vector. In\nregions of space free of sources, the conservation law for momentum for the free fields\nreads:\n\u0398 00 =\n\n1 \u239b \u2202u\n\u239e\n0 = \u2202\u03b1 \u0398\u03b1 0 = \u239c + \u2207 \u22c5S\u239f\nc \u239d \u2202t\n\u23a0\nS\n, as provided by our photon\nu\nguiding condition. The fact that the integral over space of the energy density is not a\nrelativistic constant (has different values for different frames of reference) is not of\nconcern here, because in our interpretation the primary role of the fields is as providers\nfor the particle guiding conditions, and not as a particle density. In this sense, a\nrenormalization of the energy density and Poynting vector is allowed for different frames\nof reference without conspiring against the internal consistency of the theory. This fact\nhas been also analyzed by various authors [183].\nwhich allows for the definition of a photon current v ph =\n\nThe relativistic generalization to many particles can be done analogously to the multipletime formalism introduced by Dirac [184].\nIn a similar way as that follow in eq. (9) from Section IV, we can show that our approach\nis equivalent to a first quantization formalism for QED, where the wave functions fulfill\nthe Heisenberg equation of motion as provided by QED, complemented with the\nexistence of real particles following realistic trajectories in space and time. Finally, we\nremark that semiclassical models have been able to obtain the correct expressions for the\nLamb shift in conjunction with spontaneous emission [21, 149].\n\nIX. ANALYSIS OF PREVIOUS CRITICS\nThe criticism of Oppenheimer [71] to the original theory of Landau and Peierls [69] was\nbased on the difficulties associated with the appearance of negative energies implying the\nabsence of a positive definite photon density. Formal solutions to those problems have\nbeen given by M. Hawton and collaborators [96]. We can illustrate the problem by\nconsidering the following wave function, which was discussed by Bohm and Hiley for\nbosons in general [185]:\n\n\u03c6 (x, t ) = \u03c6+ ( x )e \u2212iEt + \u03c6\u2212 ( x )e + iEt\n\n(14)\n\nallowing for both, positive and negative energy solutions. The particle density one\nobtains using the relativistic expression for current densities is:\n- 41 -\n\n\fj0 = \u03c6+* ( x )\u03c6+ ( x ) \u2212 \u03c6\u2212* ( x )\u03c6\u2212 ( x ) + \u03c6+* ( x )\u03c6\u2212 ( x )e 2iEt + cc ,\nwhich obviously is not positive definite. In our model, we can employ a solution\ninspired by second quantization: we assume that the functions \u03c6+ (x )e \u2212 iEt and \u03c6\u2212 ( x )e + iEt\nare associated with two different particles, in this case antiparticles. In this way we have\ntwo independent particle densities j0+ = \u03c6+* ( x )\u03c6+ ( x ) and j0\u2212 = \u03c6\u2212* ( x )\u03c6\u2212 (x ) , both positive\ndefinite, and the cross term doesn't exist. The total field however, as seen by other\nparticles is still given by the sum in eq. (14) as required. This procedure can be further\njustified by the approach followed in this work, where states corresponding to different\nfrequencies are distinguishable, and therefore are associated with different particle\ncoordinates.\nTwo objections are generally presented against a separation between fields attached to the\nparticle and free fields [51]. The first objection remarks that an extended field tied to a\nparticle generates a non-local correlation between the field and the particles and should\nnot be considered in a relativistic theory. In this work, we show that the non-localities\nappearing in the theory are of the same type as the non-localities generated by\nentanglement in traditional quantum mechanics, and therefore there is no reason to\nexclude them. The second objection is based on the idea that the uncertainty principle\nremoves the concept of trajectories, and therefore also of fields localized around the\nposition of the source The mere existence of our model, consistent with the quantum\nrules, where real particles follow well defined trajectories given by the guidance\nconditions, shows that this objection is really artificial.\nVery recently, it has been claimed that differences between the experimental predictions\nfrom Bohmian trajectories and the traditional interpretation of quantum mechanics exist\n[186], and that experiments have shown that the traditional predictions are the right ones\n[187]. The proposed experiments are based on the measurement of coincidences between\ntwo photons reaching a double slit simultaneously. According to traditional quantum\nmechanics, coincidences should occur independently of the position of the detectors.\nCalculations performed on Reference [186] find that coincidences should occur only\nwhen the two detectors are on different sides respect to the plane separating the two slits.\nIt can be verified, however, that the alleged differences have their origin on the\nsymmetric distribution of the initial trajectories attributed to the trajectories assumed in\nReference [186]. This implies an excessive restriction absent from a correct formulation\nof the problem. If one removes that restriction, and finds the trajectories assuming\nasymmetric as well as symmetric initial conditions, the results from traditional quantum\nmechanics are recovered, and therefore no difference exist between both theories. It\nshould be stressed that the inclusion of trajectories for the particles in no way modifies\nthe results from quantum mechanics, because those trajectories by construction, are\nexactly those that are needed to reproduce the quantum mechanical predictions.\nFinally, we mention that Bohmian mechanics has been mainly criticized because the\nparticles cannot modify the dynamics of the fields. In the model presented in this work,\n- 42 -\n\n\fon the other hand, there is a mutual interrelationship between particles and fields. The\ndynamic of the fields is modified by the dynamic of the particles and vice versa.\n\nX. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have shown that it is possible to understand the quantum mechanical atom-photon\ninteraction from a realistic point of view. This is achieved through the application of a\nfirst quantized version of quantum electrodynamics and the postulation of the real\nexistence of electrons and photons in three-dimensional space. The first quantized\nversion of quantum electrodynamics provides a unified description for charged and\nphoton particles, through a generalized equation, combining the Schr\u00f6dinger and\nMaxwell equations. The solutions to this equation are functions of the electron\ncoordinates and photon coordinates in an extended configuration space. The existence of\nelectrons and photons in three-dimensional space allows for a deterministic\nunderstanding of quantum effects in general, and for quantum jumps in particular.\nWe show that a proper normalization of the photon-wave-functions is possible by the\nseparation of the electromagnetic fields into fields attached to the particle and free fields\ncarrying the radiated energy. This separation also allows for the natural entanglement\nbetween different states of the atomic systems and the electromagnetic fields. These\ncorrelations cannot be present in a semiclassical description of the electromagnetic field.\nWe were able to show the physical origin of the Lamb shift as the joint work of the\nquantum potential and the real electron oscillating in it. In the ground state, the quantum\npotential shields completely all forces, inclusive radiation reaction forces, preventing\ntherefore the collapse of the electron towards the nucleus. In this model, the uncertainty\nprinciple becomes a consequence of the action of the quantum potential on the particle\ndynamics.\nWe can identify the similitude between the vacuum fluctuations of the radiation field and\nthe resonant self-sustained oscillations reached between the charged particle, the quantum\npotential and radiation reaction forces. This interpretation opens the door for the\nengineering of the fluctuating radiation fields, whose source should not be sought of in\ninfinity as usually interpreted, but at the real oscillations of the particles in the\nneighborhood of our system. This provides a realistic interpretation of superradiant states\nand the collective motion of atoms and molecules inside a crystal, even in their ground\nstate.\nFinally, we remark that the representation of this model in three-dimensional space\nmakes it especially adequate for the simulation of quantum devices in quantum\ncomputation and quantum information systems.\n- 43 -\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank Dr. Clay Stewart and Anu Bowman, for support during\nthe development of this work.
