Its significance\nlies in the fact that the origin of the heavy-fermion behavior is associated with non-Kramers f -electron ions,\nfor which the conventional Kondo effect seems unlikely.\nOur previous specific-heat results in magnetic fields2 established that the crystalline-electric-field (CEF) ground\nstate is a nonmagnetic \u03931 singlet. The field dependence\nof the CEF Schottky anomaly for fields greater than 14 T\nis clearly inconsistent with the alternative scenario of a\nnonmagnetic \u03933 doublet ground state. This conclusion\nwas independent of whether the exact Th point-group\nsymmetry or the higher (approximate) Oh symmetry\nwas assumed for the Pr sites.3 The singlet nature of the\nCEF ground state was subsequently confirmed by inelastic neutron scattering measurements and their analysis\nwithin the Th symmetry scheme.4\nDespite the overwhelming evidence in favor of a singlet CEF ground state, there are experimental results\nfor PrOs4 Sb12 that seem to be better understood in\nterms of a doublet ground state. For example, the\nmagnetoresistance1,5,6,7 at 1.4 K exhibits a dome-like\nshape that is consistent with model calculations of the\nCEF resistivity for a \u03933 ground state and inconsistent\nwith similar calculations for a \u03931 ground state.5 However,\nthe CEF resistivity is a single-ion property that might be\nstrongly affected in PrOs4 Sb12 by lattice coherence and\nby strong quadrupolar and exchange interactions. To\nprobe this possibility, we have performed magnetoresistance measurements on single-crystal Pr1\u2212x Lax Os4 Sb12 ,\nin which lattice translational symmetry is broken and\nintersite effects should be weaker than in the pure compound. Based on previously published magnetic susceptibility and specific heat results,8 we do not expect significant changes in CEF energies (and eigenstates) of Pr\nupon doping with La. In addition, we have extended\nmagnetoresistance measurements of the undoped mate-\n\nrial down to 20 mK.\nWe find that the magnetoresistance of pure PrOs4 Sb12\nat 20 mK is inconsistent with model calculations for either the \u03933 or the \u03931 CEF ground state, and conclude\nthat the dome feature most probably results from fluctuations in the field-induced antiferroquadrupolar (AFQ)\nphase. On dilution of the Pr lattice with La, the dome in\nthe magnetoresistance is replaced by a smeared step that\nis consistent with the picture of a \u03931 singlet CEF ground\nstate but not with a \u03933 doublet. The dependence of the\nf -electron contribution to the magnetoresistance on the\ndirection of the magnetic field is smaller than is predicted\ntheoretically based on a CEF model. This discrepancy\nsuggests that interactions omitted from the CEF model\nlead to avoided crossing in the effective levels of the Pr3+\nion.\n\nII.\n\nMETHODS\n\nResults are presented below for Pr1\u2212x Lax Os4 Sb12 with\nfour different La concentrations: x = 0, 0.05, 0.3,\nand 0.67. For x = 0, 0.3, and 0.67, we grew large\nsingle crystals (cubes with masses as large as 50 mg)\non which accurate magnetic susceptibility measurements\nwere performed up to 300 K in order to extract the roomtemperature paramagnetic effective moment. In each\ncase, this moment was within 10% of that expected for\nPr3+ . (For the undoped compound, this finding contradicts a wide range of values reported in literature.)\nThe superconducting transition temperatures Tc of the\nlarge single crystals and of smaller resistivity bars, also\nobtained in the same growths, were checked via ac susceptibility measurements. A good agreement between\nTc values of large and small crystals confirmed the stoichiometry assigned to samples used in this study. The\nresidual resistivity ratio (the ratio of the resistance at\nroom temperature to that extrapolated to T = 0) was\nRRR = 100, 50, 180, and 170 for x = 0, 0.05, 0.3, and\n0.7, respectively. The value RRR = 100 exceeds those re-\n\n\f2\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nFigure 1 shows the resistivity of undoped PrOs4 Sb12\nfor three representative fields, with both current and\nmagnetic field oriented along the (001) direction. The\nresults are similar to those reported by other groups.1,13\nBelow 200\u2013300 mK the resistivity saturates but has a\nstrong field variation. The residual resistivity \u03c10 can be\nobtained using the previously noted1,13 temperature variation at fixed field: \u03c1(T ) = \u03c10 + BT n with n > 2.

The x = 0.05 crystal was\nfrom the batch for which results were reported in Ref. 8.\nThe resistivity was measured by a conventional fourprobe technique. The estimated uncertainty in the determination of the absolute value of the resistivity was\n30% due to the unfavorable geometry of the crystals.\nWithin this uncertainty, the resistivity at room temperature was the same in all cases. In the plots below, we\nhave scaled the resistivity of each sample to a zero-field\nroom-temperature value of 300 \u03bc\u03a9cm, in the range reported previously. It is important to emphasize that this\nscaling procedure is in no way essential for the conclusions of the paper, which are based on the temperature\nand field dependence of the resistivity of a given sample.\nWe calculated the CEF contribution \u03c1CEF to the electrical resistivity via the method applied by Fisk and\nJohnston10 to the resistivity of PrB6 and by Frederick\nand Maple5 to the magnetoresistance of PrOs4Sb12 . This\nmethod focuses on a single Pr ion, neglects intersite effects, and takes no account of the direction of the current relative to the crystal axes or to the magnetic field.\nOur calculations started with one or other of two forms\nfor \u01240 , the CEF Hamiltonian for Pr3+ in zero magnetic\nfield: that (corresponding in the Oh -symmetry notation\nof Ref. 11 to W = \u22122.97 K and x = \u22120.7225) deduced5\nby fitting the temperature dependence of the zero-field\nresistivity of PrOs4 Sb12 ; or the Hamiltonian (described\nin the Th -symmetry notation of Ref. 3 by W = 3.0877 K,\nx = 0.45991, and y = 0.10503) determined from elastic12\nand inelastic4 neutron scattering. Henceforth, we refer to\nthese cases as the \"doublet\" and \"singlet\" CEF scheme,\nrespectively, according to the ground-state degeneracy of\n\u01240 .\nThe CEF states in a magnetic field H were obtained\nby diagonalizing the Hamiltonian \u01240 + g\u03bcB H * \u0134, where\ng = 4/5 is the Land\u00e9 g factor for P r3+ and \u0134 is the\nf -electron angular momentum operator. The CEF resistivity is completely determined by these CEF states,\nthe temperature T , and two constants \u03c1ex and \u03c1A , which\nparametrize, respectively, the overall strengths of magnetic exchange and the aspherical Coulomb interaction\nbetween the 4f and conduction electrons. Following Ref.\n5, we took \u03c1ex = \u03c1A = 0.25 \u03bc\u03a9cm. However, our conclusions are insensitive to the particular choice of constants.\n\n3.0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nH (T)\n\nFIG. 2: Residual resistivity vs magnetic field for PrOs4 Sb12 ,\nwith both current and field along the (001) direction. Arrows\nindicate boundaries between paramagnetic and field-induced\nordered phases.\n\nbetween \u03c10 obtained in this manner and \u03c1(T = 20 mK).\nThis residual resistivity (or resistivity at 20 mK), when\nplotted against magnetic field (Fig. 2), has a dome shape\ncentered around 9\u201310 T. Such a dome-shaped magnetoresistance has been reported previously at the somewhat\nhigher temperatures of 1.4 K (Ref. 5) and 0.36 K (Ref. 7).\nTwo explanations for this dome have been considered:\nfield-induced long-range antiferroquadrupolar (AFQ) order, and crossing of the lowest CEF levels. It is striking\nthat \u03c10 (H) rises sharply at the AFQ boundaries, indicated by arrows in Fig. 2, and peaks around 10 T, where\nthe AFQ transition temperature is highest. However,\nFrederick and Maple have shown (see Fig. 2 of Ref. 5)\nthat the width, peak position, and height of the dome in\nthe magnetoresistance of PrOs4Sb12 at 1.4 K are reproduced quite well by the single-ion CEF resistivity computed within the doublet scheme.

Irrespective of the CEF scheme, \u03c1CEF for fields oriented along the (001) direction (square symbols in Fig. 3)\nis discontinuous at the crossing field and essentially flat at\nhigher fields. It therefore seems that the low-temperature\nmagnetoresistance of PrOs4 Sb12 is dominated by effects\nbeyond those considered in the single-ion CEF model.\nWe now turn to the effects of La doping. Figure 4\nshows the magnetoresistance of Pr0.95 La0.05 Os4 Sb12 at\n20, 310, and 660 mK. Similarly to PrOs4 Sb12 , there is\n\nFIG. 5: Magnetoresistance of Pr0.7 La0.3 Os4 Sb12 at 20mK for\nthree different orientations of the magnetic field. The current\ndirection was (001).\n\na negligible temperature variation of the resistivity below 300 mK in fields above-critical for superconductivity\n(as evidenced by the overlap of the 20-mK and 310-mK\nisotherms). However, the shape of the dome for x = 0.05\nis much less symmetric about the peak field than its x = 0\ncounterpart. Between 2 T and 10 T, \u03c1(T=20 mK) for the\ndoped sample increases by over 80%, compared to a 25%\nincrease for the undoped material, whereas the resistivity\ndrop above 10 T is greater in percentage terms for x = 0.\nThe magnetoresistance becomes qualitatively different\nat higher La doping. Figure 5 shows the 20-mK magnetoresistance of Pr0.7 La0.3 Os4 Sb12 for fields along (001),\n(011), and (010); in each case, the current passed along\nthe (001) direction. All three isotherms exhibit a pronounced but wide step, centered near 9\u201310 T, superimposed on a linear background. In the investigated field\nrange this x = 0.3 material does not exhibit the dome\nstructure characteristic of x = 0 and 0.05. For each\ncurve, \u03c1 versus H is approximately linear above 13 T.\nThe resistivity of the non-f -electron analog LaOs4Sb12 ,\nmeasured at 0.36 K, has a quite large and approximately\nlinear field dependence.7 Furthermore, the directional\ndependence of the magnetoresistance of LaOs4 Sb12 -\nd\u03c1/dH being larger along (011) than along (001)-is in\nagreement with the trend of the linear background in Fig.\n5. It thus seems that the differences between the highfield slopes of \u03c1(H) in Fig. 5 can be attributed primarily to non-f -electron contributions to the magnetoresistance. Subtracting such linear parts results in very similar curves (not shown) for all three field directions. We\nconclude that the f -electron magnetoresistance in this\nmoderately doped material is nearly isotropic.\nCompared to the cases x = 0 and x = 0.05, the lowtemperature magnetoresistance of Pr0.7 La0.3 Os4 Sb12 for\nfields along (001) is much closer to that given by the CEF\n\n\f4\n4\n\n4\n\nPr\n\nLa\n\n0.7\n\nOs Sb\n\n0.3\n\n4\n\n12\n\nPr\n\n3\n\nLa\n\n0.33\n\nOs Sb\n\n0.67\n\n4\n\n12\n\ncm)\n\n2\n\n(\n\n(\n\ncm)\n\n3\n\nCEF\n\n2\n\n1\n\nT = 0.35 K\nT = 0.31 K\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nH (T)\n\nFIG. 6: Measured magnetoresistance of Pr0.7 La0.3 Os4 Sb12 at\n310 mK for current and field along the (001) direction, and\ntheoretical CEF resistivity \u03c1CEF for the same temperature\nand field direction.\n\nmodel. The 20-mK measurements (Fig. 5) are more consistent with the singlet CEF scheme than with the doublet scheme, in that the latter predicts a sharp peak that\nis absent in the data. A second and stronger argument\nin favor of the singlet scheme is provided by the nearisotropy of the f -electron magnetoresistance noted in the\nprevious paragraph. Figure 3 plots the CEF resistivity\nfor fields along (001) and (011). The doublet scheme\n(lower panel in Fig. 3) predicts a highly anisotropic \u03c1CEF\nstemming from the fact that the lowest two CEF levels cross at 8.5 T along (001), but instead diverge along\n(011). In the singlet CEF scheme (upper panel in Fig.\n3), the anisotropy is much smaller because the lowest\nCEF levels cross at 8.6 T along (001), while along the\n(011) direction they anticross at 8.3 T with a minimum\ngap of only 0.7 K. Unlike the doublet CEF scheme, the\nsinglet scheme does a reasonable job of reproducing the\nmeasured (011) magnetoresistance. However, it underestimates the width of the step for fields along (001), and\nhence still overestimates the anisotropy in the f -electron\nmagnetoresistance extracted from Fig. 5.\nFigure 6 shows that at the higher temperature of\n310 mK, there is much better agreement between the\nmagnetoresistance of Pr0.7 La0.3 Os4 Sb12 along (001) and\nand \u03c1CEF calculated within the singlet CEF scheme. At\nthis temperature, the thermal smearing of the step in\n\u03c1CEF matches quite well the width of the rise in the measured magnetoresistance. The results of similar calculations for the doublet scheme (not shown, but very similar\nto the 350-mK results in Fig. 2 of Ref. 5) are in gross disagreement with the measurement.\nThe character of the magnetoresistance seems to be\nlittle changed by further La dilution. The longitudinal\nmagnetoresistance for x = 0.67 was investigated down to\n0.35 K and in fields to 14 T. The magnetoresistance at the\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nH (T)\n\nFIG. 7: Magnetoresistance of Pr0.33 La0.67 Os4 Sb12 at 350 mK\nfor current and field along the (001) direction.\n\nlowest temperature (Fig. 7) exhibits essentially identical\nmagnetic field dependence to that for x = 0.3.\nThe main difference between the f -electron magnetoresistance inferred for dilute-Pr alloys and that calculated\nin the singlet CEF scheme relates to the low-temperature\nwidth of the step along the (001) field direction. The\nCEF model predicts an almost discontinuous jump of\nthe magnetoresistance at 20 mK at the level-crossing\nfield, while the rise in the measured magnetoresistance\nof Pr0.7 La0.3 Os4 Sb12 takes place over 3\u20134 T. Since there\nis better agreement between the measured and theoretical magnetoresistance along the (011) direction, where\nlevel anticrossing is expected, we speculate that interactions omitted from the CEF model mix the lowest levels,\npreventing any crossing even along high-symmetry field\ndirections and thereby producing isotropic magnetoresistance. These interactions are most likely nonlocal. We\nnote, however, that a mean-field treatment of intersite\nmagnetic and quadrupolar interactions between Pr ions\ndid not find avoided crossing.2,12\nFigure 6 shows that the measured midpoint field for the\nmagnetoresistance rise in Pr0.7 La0.3 Os4 Sb12 is about 1 T\nhigher than is predicted based on the CEF level scheme\ndetermined for pure PrOs4 Sb12 . This perhaps points to\na small shift in the CEF levels upon doping to 30% La.\nThe similarity between the magnetoresistance steps observed for x = 0.3 and 0.67 suggests that there is little\nfurther evolution of the CEF energies over this doping\nrange. A weak dependence of CEF levels on La doping is in agreement with our specific-heat measurements\nof the Schottky anomaly in lightly doped alloys,14 and\nis also supported by the nearly invariant temperature of\nthe maximum in the magnetic susceptibility.8\nThe contrast between the resistivity versus field curves\nfor the x = 0 and x = 0.3 samples is striking. The obvious differences between these two compositions are the\n\n\f5\npresence of a field-induced ordered phase for the pure material and the absence of translational symmetry in the\ndiluted case. Our previous specific heat measurements14\nindicate that the field-induced ordered (AFQ) phase disappears somewhere near x = 0.2. Since the model for\nthe CEF resistivity are single-site in character, it seems\nlikely that the dome-shaped magnetoresistance observed\nfor x = 0 and 0.05 is associated with the presence of longrange order in these materials, perhaps through enhanced\nscattering of conduction electrons caused by fluctuations\nin the AFQ order parameter.\nIn summary, we have shown that a simple CEF model\naccounts quite well for the f -electron contribution to the\nmagnetoresistance of Pr1\u2212x Lax Os4 Sb12 with x = 0.3 and\n0.67. The weak dependence of this contribution on field\ndirection is consistent with the existence of a singlet CEF\nin zero magnetic field, with avoided level crossing in ap-\n\n\u2217\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nElectronic address: andraka@phys.ufl.edu\nE.
