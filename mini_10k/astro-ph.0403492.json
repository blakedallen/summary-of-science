Introduction\nIncompressible fluid spheres of uniform energy density E in General Relativity were\nfirst discussed by Schwarzschild.1 The importance of this solution in General Relativistic stellar structures is apparent, because it gives an absolute upper limit on\ncompaction parameter, u(\u2261 M/a, mass to size ratio of entire configuration in geometrized units) \u2264 (4/9) for any regular static solution in hydrostatic equilibrium.2\nChandrasekhar3,4 discussed the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium under the\nsmall adiabatic perturbations, and showed that for each value of the compaction\nparameter, corresponding to the compressible homogeneous spheres, there exists\na critical (minimum) value of the \"ratio of specific heats\", \u03b3(= \u03b3crit ) such that\nfor \u03b3 < \u03b3crit , the configuration becomes dynamically unstable. For the limiting\ncase of the compaction parameter approaching the Schwarzschild limit (u = 4/9), \u03b3\n1\n\n\fNovember 15, 2018 11:24 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n2\n\nnegiws\n\nP. S. Negi\n\nbecomes infinity.\nFor dynamically stable superdense objects like neutron stars one may expect a\nfinite value of \u03b3. However, for such objects the equations of state are not well known\n[empirically] beyond the density \u223c\n= 1014 g cm\u22123 ,5 and one can only extrapolate the\nequations of state (available in the literature)6 far beyond this density. As a way\nout, one can impose some restrictions upon the known physical quantities, such\nthat, the speed of sound inside the configuration,\np\nv \u2261 (\u2202P/\u2202E)s\n\n(Where P is the pressure, E is the energy density and s stands for specific entropy)\ndoes not exceed the speed of light in vacuum, i.e., v \u2264 c = 1 (in geometrized units),\nand obtain an upper bound on stable neutron star masses.7\u22129\nIn the present paper, we have obtained an upper bound on compaction parameter (u \u2264 0.34056 corresponding to a surface redshift of 0.771) for the compressible\nhomogeneous spheres,3,4 by imposing constraint on the \"ratio of specific heats\",\n\u03b3[\u2264 2.59457)], compatible with causality (v \u2264 1) and dynamical stability. This\nvalue of the compaction parameter is an absolute maximum because, for an assigned value of \u03b3, the maximum compactness would correspond to a compressible\nuniform density sphere, and can be used to obtain an upper bound on neutron star\nmasses, as well as the minimum rotation period of a 1.442M\u2299 neutron star (the\nmaximum mass of the neutron star accurately known at present).10\n2.

Application to Obtain an Absolute Upper Bound on Mass and\nUniform Rotation of Relativistic Stars\nBy assigning the energy density E equal to the average nuclear density, i.e. E =\n2\u00d71014 g cm\u22123 ,7 in Eqs. (11) for the compaction parameter, u = 0.34056, we obtain\n\n\fNovember 15, 2018 11:24 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nnegiws\n\nCausal configurations of homogeneous energy density\n\n5\n\na maximum mass of 5.4M\u2299 [which is larger than the masses obtained earlier].7\u22129\nAlthough, the assigned value of energy density thus substituted is reasonable, it\nmight be fiduciary. Therefore, we have to constrain the value of the energy density\nby some observational fact, and it may be constrained by the fastest rotating pulsar,\nPSR 1937 + 20, with rotation period, P = 1.558 ms, known to date.18\nThe determination of maximum masses of neutron stars corresponding to maximum rotation rates require complete general relativistic calculations.19,20 However,\nthe value of E and hence the maximum mass of a static (non-rotating) configuration, corresponding to higher u values, can be obtained very accurately (see, e. g.\nRefs. 21 and 22) by using the empirical formula given by Koranda, Stergioulas, and\nFriedman23 in the following form\nProt,min (ms) = 0.740[Mmax/M\u2299 ]\n\n\u22121/2\n\n[amax /10km]\n\n3/2\n\n,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere Prot,min is the (minimum) rotation period corresponding to a configuration,\nrotating (uniformly) with maximum angular velocity, and Mmax and amax represent, respectively, the maximum mass and the corresponding size of the non-rotating\nconfiguration. Rewriting Eq. (13) in terms of compaction parameter, u[\u2261 M/a], and\nangular velocity \u03a9max (\u2261 2\u03c0/Prot,min ) we obtain\n\u22121\n\u03a9max = 2.21 \u00d7 1010 [u1/2\nmax /amax (cm)]s\n\n(14)\n\nwhere umax is the maximum u value of the non-rotating configuration, such that\nthe configuration becomes dynamically unstable when u exceeds umax , and amax\nrepresents the corresponding radius of the configuration. Note that the corresponding formula which gives an error of 4 - 5 % was previously obtained by Haensel and\nZdunik.24 By the use of Eqs. (11) into Eq. (14), we obtain\n2\n\nE(g cm\u22123 ) = 6.59 \u00d7 106 [\u03a9max ( s\u22121 )] ,\n\n(15)\n\nMmax (cm) = [3u3max /4\u03c0E(cm\u22122 )]1/2 .\n\n(16)\n\nand,\n\nThus, the uniform energy density of the configuration depends only upon the\nrotation period, and not upon the compaction parameter u. Therefore, it is clear\nfrom Eqs. (15) and (16) that for a given value of the rotation period Prot the maximum mass of the stable configuration depends only upon the maximum value of\nu(umax ). For Prot = 1.558 ms, Eq. (15) gives the energy density, E, of the configuration as 1.072 \u00d7 1014 g cm\u22123 , the substitution of umax \u223c\n= 0.34056 from Table\n1 into Eq. (16) gives the maximum mass of the configuration, Mmax \u223c\n= 7.387M\u2299\nand the corresponding radius, amax \u223c\n= 31.974 km. Notice that the range of energy\ndensity obtained in this manner is applicable to the baryonic equation of state,\nknown as Q-Star equation of state.5,22,25\nFor the value of u \u223c\n= 0.34056, the speed of sound is maximum, v \u223c\n= 1, at the\ncenter and decreases monotonically from center to the surface of the configuration,\nand at the surface it vanishes along with the pressure. These masses have important\n\n\fNovember 15, 2018 11:24 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n6\n\nnegiws\n\nP. S. Negi\n\nimplications regarding massive compact objects like Cyg X-1, Cyg XR-1, and LMC\nX-3 etc. These limits of maximum masses could be updated if the faster rotating\npulsars are observed in the future [see, Ref. 22 for a detailed discussion in this\nregard].\nOn the other hand, if we impose the constraint on energy density [by using Eq.\n(16)] such that the maximum mass of neutron star is 1.442M\u2299,10 then Eq. (15)\ngives the minimum rotation period 0.3041 ms for the maximum u \u223c\n= 0.34056, and\nthe corresponding uniform energy density E is obtained as 2.813 \u00d7 1015 g cm\u22123 .\n4. Results and Conclusions\nAn absolute upper bound on compaction parameter, u \u2264 0.34056 [or the surface\nredshift \u2264 0.771], compatible with causality and the ratio of the specific heats,\n\u03b3 \u2264 2.59457, is obtained by using the dynamically stable compressible homogeneous\nsphere. This upper limit of compaction parameter gives\n(i) The maximum static mass of conventional model of neutron stars [taking\nE = 2 \u00d7 1014 g cm\u22123 ]7,8 as 5.4M\u2299 . This is greater than 4.8M\u2299 considered as an\nupper limit earlier.\n(ii) The maximum mass of static neutron star exceeds to the value of 7.387M\u2299\nwhich is greater than the upper limit of 5.3M\u2299 for neutron stars (so called Q-star\nmodels) obtained by Hochron, Lynn and Selipesky.26 This may have important\nimplications for the heavy compact objects like Cyg X-1, Cyg XR-1, and LMC-X3\nwhich may not, necessarily, be black holes.\n(iii) The minimum rotation periods for a static 1.442M\u2299 neutron star to be\n0.3041 ms with a uniform energy density E as 2.813 \u00d7 1015 g cm\u22123 .\n(iv) A causally consistent and dynamically stable model of ultra-compact objects\n[u > (1/3)] which has important astrophysical significance [see, e.g. Ref. 16 and\nreferences therein].\nAcknowledgments\nThe author acknowledges State Observatory, Nainital for providing library and\ncomputer center facilities.\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n\nK.
