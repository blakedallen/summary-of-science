Introduction\nOne of the most important issues of the current high\nenergy physics is to find the Higgs boson and to reveal its\nnature. The LHC will most likely find a Higgs candidate\nand the ILC is expected to follow it to complete the mission [1][2]. To study the Higgs properties in detail we need\na high performance central tracker.\n\u2217 Corresponding author.

Kobayashi)\n\nPreprint submitted to TIPP09 Proceedings in NIMA\n\nA TPC is a natural candidate for the ILC central tracker\nbecause of its very good performance in the past collider\nexperiments [3]. At the ILC, however, we need the highest\npossible tracking efficiency in a jetty environment and a\nmomentum resolution one order-of-magnitude better than\nthose in the past. This requires very high 3-dimensional\ngranularity (a small voxel size) and a space point resolution in the r \u2212 \u03c6 plane better than 100 \u03bcm throughout the\nsensitive volume. In order to realize a TPC with such unprecedented performance, intense R&D programs are now\non going in an international framework called the LC-TPC\ncollaboration. Three technologies have been considered as\nNovember 12, 2018\n\n\f1.27 mm in the case of the GEM readout2 , corresponding\nto the increase in the width of the pad response function\nwhile the pad-row pitch (6.3 mm) was retained.\nThe MWPC-TPC was operated inside a 5-T solenoid\nat DESY and the GEM-TPC data was taken inside a 1T solenoid at the KEK cryogenic center. A pair of long\nscintillation counters was used for cosmic ray triggers. The\nreadout electronics system for the ALEPH TPC [10] was\nused for the chamber signal processing and the traditional\nMultiFit (DoubleFit) program [11] was used for the data\nanalysis of the cosmic ray events.\nThe hit coordinate along a pad row was determined by\na simple charge centroid (barycenter) method using the\npad signals within a charge cluster in the row. Among\nthe tracks recorded in the TPC, those which were nearly\nperpendicular to the pad rows (sense wires) and parallel\nto the readout plane were selected for later analysis.\n\nthe gas amplification device for the ILC-TPC: MWPC,\nMicroMEGAS [4] and GEM [5].\nIn order to compare the different readout technologies, we prepared a small prototype TPC with a replaceable readout plane consisting of a gas amplification device\nand a pad plane. The results of the beam test at KEK\nfor a MicroMEGAS readout using a gas mixture of Arisobutane(5%) have already been published [6]. In this\npaper our results of cosmic ray tests for an MWPC readout using a TDR gas (Ar-CH4 (5%)-CO2 (2%)) [1] and for a\ntriple GEM readout operated in a T2K gas (Ar-CF4 (3%)isobutane(2%)) [7] are presented.\n2. Experimental Setup\nThe GEM-based prototype is described in Ref. [8], where\nthe preliminary results of the beam test for the GEM readout using a TDR gas or a P5 gas (Ar-CH4 (5%)) are presented. The sensitive volume of the prototype was \u223c 260\nmm in length and 152 mm in diameter. The size of the\npad plane was 100 mm \u00d7 100 mm. The induction gap of\nthe triple GEM stack was increased later from 1 mm to\n1.5 mm for the cosmic ray tests using a T2K gas, in order\nto increase the charge spread after gas amplification, while\nthe transfer gaps (1.5 mm) were maintained. A picture of\nthe prototype is shown in Fig. 1.\n\n!\"#$% &'()\n\n3. MWPC Readout\nThe spatial resolution as a function of the drift distance\n(z) obtained under a magnetic field (B) of 4 T is shown in\nFig. 2. The sense-wire potential was set to 1200 V while\nthe grid wires were grounded. The drift field strength (Ed )\nwas 220 V/cm, at which the transverse\n\u221a diffusion constant\n(D) of drift electrons is about 60 \u03bcm/ cm. Also shown in\nthe figure is the result of a Monte Carlo simulation. The\nsimulation took into account the primary ionization statistics of incident tracks, the diffusion of drift electrons, the\nlateral displacement of the drift electrons (charge spread)\nnear the wire planes due to the E \u00d7 B effect, and finally\nthe avalanche fluctuation in gas amplification.\n\n\u0001 \u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\n\u000e\u000f\u0010\u0011\u0012\u0013\u0014\n\n*+,-.\n/01234567\n\n\u0015\u0016\u0017\u0018\u0019\u001a\u001b \u001c\u001d\u001e\u001f\n\nFigure 1: Photograph of the prototype just before installation into\nthe gas vessel.\n\nFor the MWPC readout the GEM foils were replaced\nby two wire planes [9]. The sense-wire plane consisted of 20\n\u03bcm thick wires spaced with 2 mm pitch and was placed 1\nmm above the readout pad plane, on which pad rows were\narranged in parallel to the wires. The drift region was delimited by a grid wire plane. The grid wire plane consisted\nof 127 \u03bcm thick wires strung 1 mm above the sense-wire\nplane with 2 mm spacing. It should be noted that the\nsense-wire pitch and the wires-to-pads distance were kept\nsmall as compared to those in conventional TPCs in order\nto obtain the best spatial resolution and the highest twotrack resolving power achievable with a practical MWPC\nreadout1 . The pad pitch was increased to 2.3 mm, from\n1\n\nFigure 2: Spatial resolution measured with the MWPC readout in a\nmagnetic field of 4 T. The solid line shows the result of the simulation.\n\nThe simulation program Garfield/Magboltz [12] was\nused to estimate the displacement of the drift electrons\nalong the wire direction (dx) due to the E \u00d7 B effect\nas a function of the initial position along the track (y)\n2 The neighboring pad rows were staggered by half a pad pitch in\nthe GEM readout.\n\nThe width of the pad response function (\u03c3) was about 1.3 mm.\n\n2\n\n\f(see Fig. 3 and 4). The simulated resolution clearly shows\nthe large contribution of the E \u00d7 B effect at short drift\ndistances and its reduction with increasing z due to the\ndeclustering effect caused by the diffusion of the drift electrons [13].\n\nFigure 5: Simulated spatial resolution of the ILC-TPC equipped\nwith the MWPC readout operated in TDR gas (left) and in T2K gas\n(right) for tracks perpendicular to the wires and the pad rows.\n\nFigure 3: Simulated drift electron paths without diffusion in TDR\ngas for a track perpendicular to the wires (B = 4 T).\n\n4. GEM readout\nThe spatial resolutions measured under magnetic fields\nof 0 and 1 T are shown in Fig. 6. The high voltage applied\nacross each GEM of the triple stack was 250 V and the\nelectric fields in the transfer and induction gaps were set\nto 1.6 kV/cm. The solid curves in the figure are the results\nof analytic calculation [6]. The resolution deterioration at\nshort drift distances prominent for the T2K gas at 1 T is\nnot caused by an E \u00d7 B effect but by the finite pitch of\nthe readout pads (1.27 mm), which is not small enough\ncompared to the charge spread after gas amplification in\nthe GEM stack (\u223c 270 \u03bcm) [6].\n\nFigure 4: Displacement of the arrival position of drift electrons on the\nsense wire as a function of the initial position along the track for B =\n1, 2, 3 and 4 T. The coordinate y is measured from the point on the\ntrack right above the sense wire. The increase of displacement (dx),\nespecially for large y, degrades the spatial resolution significantly.\n\nFig. 5 shows the simulated spatial resolution of the\nILC-TPC equipped with the MWPC readout for B = 0,\n1 and 4 T. The resolution for B = 4 T is dominated by\nthe E \u00d7 B effect throughout the drift region in spite of its\ndecrease at long drift distances where the contribution of\nthe electron diffusion increases. The situation is worse for\nT2K gas because of the larger charge spread near the wire\nplanes caused by the E \u00d7 B effect and the smaller declustering\n\u221a effect due to its small diffusion constant (D \u223c 30\n\u03bcm/ cm at Ed = 250 V/cm and B = 4 T). Therefore T2K\ngas would not be a good choice for MWPC readout even\nif the MWPC itself operated properly in this gas mixture.\n\nFigure 6: Spatial resolution as a function of the drift distance obtained with a T2K gas (Ed = 250 V/cm) for B = 0 and 1 T. The\nresolutions obtained in the beam test with a P5 gas (Ed = 100 V/cm)\nare also shown for comparison.\n\nThe spatial resolution (\u03c3X ) at long drift distances is\ngiven by\n2\n2\n\u03c3X\n= \u03c3X0\n+ D2 /Neff * z ,\n\n3\n\n\fwhere \u03c3X0 is the intrinsic resolution and Neff is the effective number of electrons, which is determined by the\nprimary ionization statistics and the avalanche fluctuation\nfor a single drift electron [14].\nSince the diffusion constant is determined from the zdependence of the pad response width [6][8] (or given by\nMagboltz) one can evaluate Neff from the z-dependence of\nthe spatial resolution at long drift distances. The value of\nNeff thus obtained was about 21, which is in good agreement with a simple estimate of 22.2 [14], indicating that\npossible dissociative attachment of drift electrons by CF4\nmolecules [15][16][17] at the entrance to the GEM stack is\nnot significant if any.\nWe also measured the diffusion constant and the drift\nvelocity in a T2K gas as functions of the drift field, covering from the diffusion minimum (Ed = 100 V/cm) to the\ndrift velocity near-maximum (Ed = 250 V/cm). The drift\nvelocity was estimated from the full width of the drift time\ndistribution and the maximum drift length of the prototype. The results are shown in Fig. 7 along with the corresponding Magboltz predictions, which closely reproduce\nthe data points. The reliability of Magboltz for this gas\nmixture was thus confirmed for the practical range of the\nelectric field for TPC operation.\n\nFigure 8: Expected resolution of a GEM-based TPC operated in\nT2K gas for tracks perpendicular to the pad rows.\n\nto give the required spatial resolution of better than 100\n\u03bcm throughout the sensitive volume under a 4 T magnetic\nfield.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to the KEK cryogenic center and the\nIPNS cryogenic group for the operation of the superconducting magnet.

Conclusion\nMWPC readout turned out to be inappropriate for a\nTPC operated in a strong magnetic field because of a large\nE \u00d7 B effect on its spatial resolution. Therefore it can not\nbe a fall-back option for the ILC-TPC. A GEM-based TPC\nusing a T2K gas is a good candidate for the central tracker\nof the ILC experiment. It operates stably and is expected\n4\n\n\f"}
