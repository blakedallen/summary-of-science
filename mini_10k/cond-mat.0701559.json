We show that the disorder induced\ndamping of the resonant spin polarization can be strongly reduced by an optimal field configuration\nthat exploits the interference between Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction. This leads to\na striking enhancement of the spin susceptibility while the spin-Hall current vanishes at the same\ntime. We give an interpretation of the spin current in geometrical terms which are associated with\nthe trajectories the polarization describes in spin space.\nPACS numbers: 73.23.-b, 73.21.Fg, 76.30.-v, 72.25.Rb\n\nThe ability to coherently control the spin of charge\ncarriers in semiconductor nanostructures is the main focus of spintronics1 . Band-structure and confinement effects in these systems lead to a strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI) offering the possibility to efficiently access the charge carrier spin via the control of its orbital\nmotion2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 .\nA versatile and efficient scheme of spin control is electric dipole induced spin resonance\n(EDSR)10,11,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 where electric radio\nfrequency (rf) fields give rise to internal fields coupling\nto the spin. Choosing an adequate configuration of the\nelectric rf fields and a static magnetic field defining\na quantization axis for the spin, arbitrary spin rotations can be realized. This is analogous to standard\nparamagnetic spin resonance techniques, has the advantage, however, that it can be integrated in gated\nnanostructures thereby avoiding magnetic rf coils.\nIn a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with pure\nRashba SOI the amount of spin polarization which can\nbe achieved by EDSR is severely limited by disorder19 .\nSimilar limitations are found for pure Dresselhaus SOI.\nHowever, if both Dresselhaus and Rashba SOI are present\ninterference between the two SOI mechanisms can occur and qualitatively new behavior emerges, such as\nanisotropy in spin relaxation21,22,23 and transport24,25,26 .\nFor spin relaxation this anisotropy is most pronounced if\nboth SOIs have equal strength. In this case, the spin\nalong the [110] direction [see Fig. 1] is conserved21,27 ,\nand the associated spin relaxation rates vanish, whereas\nthey become maximal along the perpendicular direction\n[11\u03040]. For the driven system considered here we show\nthat similar interference effects occur and that not only\nthe internal rf field but also the EDSR linewidth becomes\ndependent on the direction of the magnetic field. In\na microscopic approach we show then that due to this\ndependence an optimal configuration exists where the\nlinewidth and the internal field simultaneously become\nminimal and maximal, resp., and that, as a remarkable\nconsequence, the spin susceptibility gets dramatically enhanced. In other words, this optimal configuration allows one to obtain a high spin polarization with relatively\nsmall electric fields and thus making the power consump-\n\na\n\npy\n\n[010]\n\nb\n\n~0\nB\n\u03b8\n~\nE\npx\npy\n\n\u03b8\u2032\n1.9\n\n3.2 4.1\n[100]\n\npx\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) a) Momentum dependent magnetic\nfields induced by Rashba- (black arrows) and Dresselhaus SOI\n(red arrows) \u03a9R (p) = \u03b1(py , \u2212px ) and \u03a9D (p) = \u03b2(px , \u2212py ),\nrespectively. Inset: The sum \u03a9R + \u03a9D for equal strength\nof the SOI (\u03b1 = \u03b2) is shown. The interference of the two\ntypes of SOI leads to a suppression or enhancement of the\nspin splitting in certain crystallographic directions. b) Polar\nplot of the resonance susceptibility \u03c7\u0304res (in arbitrary units) as\na function of \u03b8 for \u03b2 = \u03b1/2 and \u03c9L \u03c4 = 1 (black, solid curve),\n\u03c9L \u03c4 = 2(red, dotted), and \u03c9L \u03c4 = 3(blue, dashed). The configuration of the external magnetic and electric field B0 and\nE0 is shown. For B0 ||E0 ||[110] both SOI contributions add\nconstructively in the direction perpendicular to B0 leading to\nan enlarged Rabi field.\n\ntion for spin polarization minimal.\nDue to spin-orbit interaction angular momentum can\nbe transferred between spin and orbital degrees of freedom. This fact leads, in particular, to a dynamical coupling between spin and spin current described by the\nHeisenberg equation of motion19,28,29 . Exploiting this\ncoupling we show that the spin current can be interpreted in geometrical terms: the spin dynamics generated by the rf fields describes an elliptical trajectory. The\nspin-Hall conductivity can then be expressed entirely in\nterms of the semi-minor and semi-major axis and the\ntilt angle of this ellipse. Since the spin dynamics (trajectories) is experimentally accessible, for instance with\noptical methods8,9 , this opens up the possibility for a direct measurement of the spin-Hall current. Finally, we\nfind that for the optimal configuration the spin current\nvanishes, in stark contrast to the spin polarization which,\n\n\f2\nas mentioned, becomes maximal.\nWe consider a non-interacting 2DEG consisting of electrons with mass m and charge e which are subject to a\nrandom impurity\npotential V . We take into account linP\ni\near SOI\nij \u03a9ij pj \u03c3 of the Rashba - and Dresselhaus\ni\ntype where \u03c3 , i = 1, 2, 3, are the Pauli matrices and p is\nthe canonical momentum. Taking the coordinate axes\nalong the [100], [010], [001] crystallographic directions,\nthe internal magnetic field \u03a9 is then given by (cf. Fig.1)\n\u03a9(p) = \u03b1(py , \u2212px , 0) + \u03b2(px , \u2212py , 0) where \u03b1 and \u03b2 is\nthe strength of the Rashba and Dresselhaus SOI, respectively. Additionally, the external static magnetic field is\ngiven by B0 = B0 e|| with e|| = (\u2212 sin \u03b8, cos \u03b8, 0), and the\nexternal electric rf field by E(t) = E(t)(\u2212 sin \u03b8\u2032 , cos \u03b8\u2032 , 0),\nwhere \u03b8, \u03b8\u2032 are the angles enclosed with the [010] direction. The system is described by the Hamiltonian\n1\n2\n(p \u2212 eA) + (\u03a9 (p \u2212 eA) + b0 ) * \u03c3 + V, (1)\n2m\nRt\nwhere A(t) = \u2212 dt\u2032 E(t\u2032 ) is the vector potential associated with E and b0 = g\u03bcB B0 /2 with g the electron\ng-factor and \u03bcB the Bohr magneton.\nSpin polarization. We turn now to the calculation of\nthe spinRpolarization (magnetization/\u03bcB ) per unit area,\n\u221e\nS(\u03c9) = \u2212\u221e dtei\u03c9t h\u03c3(t)i/2\u03c0, evaluated in linear response\nto an applied electric field E(\u03c9) = E0 [\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 ) +\n\u03b4(\u03c9 + \u03c90 )]/2 and in the presence of both Rashba and\nDresselhaus SOI. Due to the interference between these\ntwo SOI mechanisms we need to carefully extend earlier\ncalculations19 , which were restricted to Rashba (Dresselhaus) SOI only, to this new situation.

Here, the functions qij and q\nare second order in aR and aD , and depend on the frequency \u03c9, the Larmor frequency \u03c9L , and the angle \u03b836 .\nIn the EDSR system, Pauli paramagnetism gives rise to\na constant equilibrium polarization Seq = \u03bd~\u03c9L e|| along\nB0 which is independent of the electric field. The polarization dynamically generated by E(\u03c9), however, depends on the amplitude of the oscillating internal field\nperpendicular to B0 . It is thus instructive to consider\nthe longitudinal (along B0 ||e|| ) and the transverse (along\ne\u22a5 \u2261 e|| \u00d7 e3 and e3 ) polarization components given by\nS \u20322 = e|| * S and S \u20321 = e\u22a5 * S, S \u20323 = S 3 , resp.\nAs a result, we find the polarization S \u2032i (\u03c9) =\n\u03c7\u0304 (\u03c9, \u03b8\u2032 )E(\u03c9) in terms of the transformed susceptibility\n\u03c7\u0304. To lowest order in aR , aD only the transverse compoi\n\nable to identify a configuration that allows one to obtain a maximum degree of spin polarization due to this\ninterference.\nWorking in the linear response regime, S i (\u03c9) is obtained from a Kubo formula averaged over the random\ndistribution of impurities in the 2DEG. We evaluate this\naverage with standard diagrammatic techniques assuming the impurities to be short-ranged, isotropic and uniformly distributed. In this case, the impurity average\nV (x)V (x\u2032 ) \u2261 (m\u03c4 )\u22121 \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ) is \u03b4 - correlated and proportional to the momentum relaxation time \u03c4 . We further take the Fermi energy EF = p2F /2m to be the largest\nenergy scale in the problem. Then, to leading order in\n1/pF l with l = pF /m\u03c4 the mean free path, the averaged\nspin polarization is given by the diffuson diagram, giving rise30 to a correction \u03c3 i \u2192 \u03a3i \u2261 \u03a3ij \u03c3 j of the spin\nvertex (cf. ref.19 ) in the Kubo formula. Thus, the spin\nsusceptibility defined by S i (\u03c9) = \u03c7ij (\u03c9)Ej (\u03c9) is given by\n\n\u03c7ij (\u03c9) =\n\nk=3\nX\n\nk=1\n\n\"\n\n#\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n2e\u03bd\u03c4 \u03b4 ik \u2212 1 \u2212\n\u03a3ik \u03a9kj ,\n\u03bb\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bd = m/2\u03c0~2 is the two-dimensional density of\nstates and \u03bb(\u03c9) = 1 \u2212 i\u03c9\u03c4 .\nWe evaluate the vertex correction \u03a3 of Eq.(2) for the\ncase of a magnetic field B0 that is large compared to the\ninternal fields induced by SOI.

The linewidth \u0393 of the resonance peak is given by\n\u0393 = \u2212Im q(\u03c9 = \u03c9L )/2\u03c9L \u03c4 2 = 2p2F \u03c4 /~2\n(6)\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\n2\n\u0001 (\u03b1 + \u03b2 ) \u2212 2\u03b1\u03b2 sin(2\u03b8)\n\u00d7 \u03b12 + \u03b2 2 + 2\u03b1\u03b2 sin(2\u03b8) +\n.\n2[1 + (\u03c9L \u03c4 )2 ]\n\nNote that in \u0393 the Rashba and Dresselhaus SOI do not\nsimply add up but can interfere with each other, enabling a strong enhancement of the susceptibility as we\nwill see next. In Fig. 1 we plot the spin susceptibility at resonance, \u03c7\u0304res \u221d [cos(\u03b8\u2032 \u2212 \u03b8) \u2212 sin(\u03b8\u2032 + \u03b8)\u03c1] /\u0393 for\nthe case \u03c1 = \u03b2/\u03b1 = 0.5 measured in25 . The angle \u03b8\u2032\nhas been tuned to maximize \u03c7\u0304res which displays a pronounced dependence on the magnetic field direction. In\nEq. (6) we note that \u0393 scales with the mean square fluctuations of the internal magnetic fields h(e|| * \u03a9(pF n\u0302))2 in\u0302\nand h(e\u22a5 * \u03a9(pF n\u0302))2 in\u0302 , where h.in\u0302 denotes a uniform average over all (in-plane) directions n\u0302. Comparison with\na simple model31,32 of spin relaxation (Bloch equation)\nshows that the first term in Eq. (6) comes from pure\ndephasing, i.e. from disorder induced fluctuations of\nthe internal fields along B0 , while the second term is\ndue to fluctuations along e\u22a5 . Choosing a configuration\nwith \u03b8 = \u03b8\u2032 = \u2212\u03c0/4 and tuning the SOI strengths to\n\u03b1 = \u03b2 the first term vanishes while the second is subject to narrowing due to the magnetic field. The width\nbecomes \u0393DP /[1 + (\u03c9\u03c4 )2 ] where \u0393DP = 2(\u03b1pF )2 \u03c4 /~2 is\nthe D'yakonov - Perel spin relaxation rate for Rashba\nSOI. Increasing the frequency such that (at resonance)\n\u03c9L \u03c4 = \u03c9\u03c4 \u226b 1 will lead to an increase of the inverse\nwidth \u0393\u22121 and, hence, of the susceptibility at resonance,\ngiven by\ne\u03b1\u03c4 p\n1 + (\u03c9L \u03c4 )2 .\n(7)\n|\u03c7\u0304res\n\u03b1=\u03b2 | = Seq\n~\u0393DP\n\nFor comparison, we find the ratio to the resonance suscepres\nres\ntibility \u03c7\u0304res\n\u03b2=0 in the pure Rashba case as |\u03c7\u0304\u03b1=\u03b2 /\u03c7\u0304\u03b2=0 | =\n2\n2\n(1 + y )[1 + 1/(2(1 + y ))] growing quadratically with y =\n\u03c9L \u03c4 . Thus, the spin polarization can be substantially enhanced by tuning the SOIs to equal strengths and by increasing the magnetic field. Finally, the range of validity\nfor the linear response regime can be estimated as fol\u20323,res\nlows. Assuming full polarization (|S\u03b1=\u03b2\n|/Seq \u2248 1) and\n9\nparameters for a GaAs 2DEG with spin-orbit splitting\n\u2206SO = \u03b1pF = 60 \u03bceV, Fermi wavelength \u03bbF = 180 nm\nand \u03c9L \u03c4 = 10, we find from Eq. (7) that the linear response is valid for electric fields with amplitudes up to\nE0 = 2\u03c0\u2206SO /\u03bbF \u03c9L \u03c4 \u2248 200 eVm\u22121 .\nPolarization and Spin current. We consider the spin\ncurrent defined by I3 = h{\u03c3 3 , v}i/2. Using the Heisenberg equation of motion the spin current components Ix3\u2032\n\nand Iy3\u2032 along e\u22a5 and e|| can be expressed in terms of the\npolarization at frequency \u03c9 as\n\u0012 3 \u0013\n~\nIx\u2032\n(8)\n=\n2\nIy3\u2032\n2m(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )\n\u0013\n\u0012\n[\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 sin(2\u03b8)](i\u03c9S \u20321 + \u03c9L S \u20323 ) \u2212 i\u03c9\u03b2 cos(2\u03b8)S \u20322\n.\n\u00d7\n(\u03b1 + \u03b2 sin(2\u03b8))i\u03c9S \u20322 \u2212 \u03b2 cos(2\u03b8)(i\u03c9S \u20321 + \u03c9L S \u20323 )\nWe consider the configuration \u03b8 = \u03b8\u2032 = \u2212\u03c0/4 such\nthat the SOI induced internal rf field is perpendicular\nto B0 and the longitudinal component S \u20322 (t) = Seq\nis not altered in linear response in E. Note that in\nthis case Eq.(8) simplifies such that Ix3\u2032 = ~(i\u03c9S \u20321 +\n\u03c9L S \u20323 )/(2m(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)). This relation differs from the naive\nmodel of an average spin-orbit field equating the internal field \u03a9(p(t)) with its average \u03a9(hpi(t)). Contrary to\nEq.(8), we then find i\u03c9S \u20321 + \u03c9L S \u20323 = \u03931 S \u20321 where \u03931 is\na phenomenological transverse relaxation rate. Discrepancies to the model of an averaged spin-orbit field occur\nsimilarly for other effects such as the generation of an\nout-of plane polarization33 and Zitterbewegung34 .\nWe proceed by evaluating the spin-Hall current Ix3\u2032 in\nterms of the vertex correction Eq.(3) which was obtained\nin the diagrammatic approach and is valid up to second\norder in aR , aD . The linear combination i\u03c9S \u20321 + \u03c9L S \u20323\ncancels in lowest order (cf. Eq.(4)) such that Ix3\u2032 is given\nby the second order terms qij , q. From Eq.(2) and Eq.(8)\nwe find the spin-Hall conductivity, defined as \u03c3x3,res\n=\n\u2032 y\u2032\n~Ix3\u2032 /2E(\u03c9), to be given by\n\u03c3x3,res\n\u2032 y\u2032 =\n\ni\u03c9L \u03c4 (\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )\ne\n.\n2\n4\u03c0 (3\u03b1 \u2212 2\u03b1\u03b2 + 3\u03b2 2 ) \u2212 i2\u03c9L \u03c4 (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)2\n\n(9)\n\nRemarkably, for high frequencies \u03c9L \u03c4 (\u03b1\u2212\u03b2)2 \u226b (\u03b1+\u03b2)2\nand \u03b1 6= \u03b2 Eq.(9) reaches the universal limit \u03c3x3,res\n=\n\u2032 y\u2032\n|e|/8\u03c0 \u00d7 (\u03b1 + \u03b2)/(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2) (independent of the disorder\ndetails). This limit depends only on the ratio \u03b1/\u03b2 of the\nstrengths of the SOIs, but not on their absolute values,\nand agrees with the clean limit found in35 for \u03b2 = 0.\nIndeed, for the condition \u03c9L \u03c4 \u226b 1 (\u03c9L = \u03c9), many cycles\nof the electric rf field pass through between subsequent\nscattering events such that the system effectively behaves\nas ballistic. This regime can be exploited to achieve high\nspin polarizations as described above.\nMoreover, the singularity in Eq.(8) for \u03b1 = \u03b2 is removed in Eq.(9) up to the accuracy O(a2R , a2D , aD aR )\nconsidered here and we find that \u03c3x3,res\nvanishes in the\n\u2032 y\u2032\nconfiguration where \u03c7\u0304 is maximal, i.e. for \u03b1 = \u03b2 and\n\u03b8 = \u03b8\u2032 = \u2212\u03c0/4.\nWe turn now to a geometrical interpretation of the\nspin Hall current relating it to the trajectories S =\n{(S \u20321 (t), S \u20323 (t))|t \u2208 R} followed by the tip of the polarization vector. For an applied electric field E(\u03c9) =\nE0 e|| [\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 ) + \u03b4(\u03c9 + \u03c90 )]/2 with frequency \u03c90 this\ntrajectory is given by the polarization (as a function of\ntime)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u20321 \u0013\ncos \u03c90 t\nS (t)\n(10)\n= \u039b(\u03c90 )\nsin \u03c90 t\nS \u20323 (t)\n\n\f4\nwith the matrix\n\u039b(\u03c90 ) = E0\n\n\u0012\n\nRe\u03c7\u03041 (\u03c90 ) \u2212Im\u03c7\u03041 (\u03c90 )\nRe\u03c7\u03043 (\u03c90 ) \u2212Im\u03c7\u03043 (\u03c90 )\n\n\u0013\n\n(11)\n\ncontaining the Fourier components \u03c7\u03041,3 (\u03c9) of the susceptibility evaluated at \u03c9 = \u03c90 . Eq. (10) constitutes a quadratic form for the trajectory given by S =\n{(S \u20321 , S \u20323 )|S\u2032t * \u039b2 S\u2032 = 1} with real, positive eigenvalues \u03bb1,2 (say \u03bb1 < \u03bb2 ) of the defining matrix \u039b2 =\n(\u039b\u22121 )t \u039b\u22121 . Thus, S is of elliptic\n\u221a shape with semi-major\n\u221a\nand semi-minor axis a = 1/ \u03bb1 and b = 1/ \u03bb2 , resp.\nWe can further determine the angle \u03b4 enclosed by the\nsemi-major axis of S and the S \u20321 direction since the matrix \u039b2 is diagonalized by a rotation \u03b4 around S \u20322 . The\npolarization of Eq. (10) can thus be written as\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012 \u20321 \u0013 \u0012\na cos(\u03c90 t + \u03c6)\ncos \u03b4 \u2212 sin \u03b4\nS (t)\n.\n=\nb sin(\u03c90 t + \u03c6)\nsin \u03b4 cos \u03b4\nS \u20323 (t)\n(12)\nHere, \u03c6 is a phase shift between the electric field and the\npolarization. From Eqs. (10) and (12), we can relate the\nreal and imaginary part of the susceptibilities \u03c7\u03041 and \u03c7\u03043\nto the parameters a, b, \u03c6, and \u03b4. In particular, we obtain\nthe spin Hall current (Eq.(8)) at resonance (\u03c9L = \u03c9) as\nIx3\u2032 (\u03c9) =\n\n~E(\u03c9)ei(\u03c6\u2212\u03b4)\ni\u03c9L (a \u2212 b) .\n2m(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)E0\n\n(13)\n\nEq. (13) provides a remarkable interpretation of the spin\nHall current in terms of the geometric properties of the\norbit S. The component Ix3\u2032 is given by a complex phase\ndepending on the rotation angle \u03b4 and the difference between the semi-minor and semi-major axis a \u2212 b. In the\nlinear response regime, the spin Hall current characterizes the deviation from a circular orbit with a = b to an\nelliptic shape (with a 6= b). Therefore, Ix3\u2032 becomes accessible in terms of simple geometric properties of S in\nexperiments capable of resolving individual polarization\ncomponents.\n\n1\n\n2\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nD.
