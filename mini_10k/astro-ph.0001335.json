The three gamma-ray burst (GRB) classes identified by statistical clustering analysis [7] are examined using the pattern recognition algorithm C4.5 [8]. Although the statistical existence of Class 3 (intermediate duration, intermediate fluence,\nsoft) is supported, the properties of this class do not need to arise from a distinct source\npopulation. Class 3 properties can easily be produced from Class 1 (long, high fluence,\nintermediate hardness) by a combination of measurement error, hardness/intensity correlation, and a newly-identified BATSE bias (the fluence duration bias). Class 2 (short,\nlow fluence, hard) does not appear to be related to Class 1.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nGRB spectral and temporal properties overlap, providing a continuum of burst\ncharacteristics. Some of this overlap is intrinsic in nature, while much is due to\ninstrumental and observational biases. In addition to this overlap, there is clustering indicative of classes within the parameter space defined by GRB attributes.\nIn particular, there are two long-recognized GRB classes [2,5] based on duration\n(divided at roughly 2 seconds) and spectral hardness. A statistically significant\nthird class has been identified using statistical clustering analysis [7].\nCan effects attributable to a source population be separated from instrumental\neffects? To answer this, we have applied computer science pattern recognition algorithms to learn why bursts cluster in some parameter spaces. For this analysis,\nwe have used the supervised decision tree classifier C4.5 [8]. Supervised classifiers\nestablish rules for previously identified patterns, and must be trained by representative class members.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe three GRB classes identified by statistical clustering techniques [7] can be\nfound from three significant classification attributes; 50 to 300 keV fluence, T90\n\n\fduration, and HR321 hardness ratio (the fluence in the 100 to 300 keV band divided\nby the fluence in the 25 to 100 keV band). The properties of the three classes in\nterms of these attributes are demonstrated in Table 1.\nTABLE 1. Statistical clustering classes, from 3B GRBs.\nAttributes\nT90:\nFluence:\nHardness:\n\nClass 1 (Long)\nlong\nlarge\nintermediate\n\nClass 2 (Short)\nshort\nsmall\nhard\n\nClass 3 (Intermediate)\nintermediate\nintermediate\nsoft\n\nC4.5 was trained on the three GRB classes using five fluences, two durations,\nthree peak fluxes, and three hardness ratios. C4.5 produced a decision tree containing IF THEN ELSE branches for placing each GRB in the appropriate class;\nthese branches were pruned to remove branches containing less than four GRBs.\nRules were then generated for each class based on the pruned branches. C4.5 identifies outliers with poorly defined rules that often contain few GRBs. Statistical\nmethods find that outliers are not closely bound to the class (cluster) centers. C4.5\nrules identified a number of GRBs as having peculiar hardness ratios; these resulted\nfrom large individual channel fluence errors. The GRBs with the largest 10% relative errors (error divided by measurement) were subsequently removed from the\ndatabase. The remaining 3B GRBs were reclassified using C4.5; the resulting rules\nwere used to classify 4B Catalog GRBs and thus increase the database size.\n\nClass 3 Spectral Hardnesses\nC4.5 verified that the three GRB classes resulted primarily from the attributes\nof spectral hardness, duration, and fluence. With the larger classification database,\nthe dependence on spectral hardness could be examined in terms of the spectral\nfitting parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, and Epeak [1]. Using only these three attributes, C4.5 was\nable to accurately classify most of the 4B GRBs. The rules generated by C4.5 were\nable to cleanly separate Class 2 from Class 1, but could not delineate Class 3 from\nClass 1 (85% of Class 3 bursts were assigned to Class 1).\nUpon further examination, Class 3 GRBs were found to have Epeak values similar\nto Class 1 bursts of the same 1024 ms peak flux (Figure 1). The correlation between\nEpeak and peak flux has been interpreted as cosmological redshift [6].\n\nClass 3 Fluences and Durations\nSince at least one of the three defining characteristics of Class 3 actually represents a data correlation, we hypothesized that Class 3 GRBs actually belong to\nClass 1. We decided to see if Class 3 fluences and durations could be explained in\nterms of Class 1 attributes. This could be the case if some instrumental or sampling\nbias made Class 1 GRBs appear to be shorter and fainter than they should be.\n\n\fFIGURE 1. Epeak vs. p1024 for the Three GRB Classes.\n\nFigure 2 is a plot of fluence vs. 1024 ms peak flux for each of the three GRB\nclasses, and is limited to GRBs detected when BATSE had one homogeneous set\nof trigger criteria. There are distinct regions outside of which no GRBs are found.\nGRBs with 1024 ms peak fluxes less than 0.2 photons cm\u22122 second\u22121 are not\ndetected, since this is below BATSE's minimum detection threshold. GRBs do not\nhave fluences less than what would be found in their time-integrated 1024 ms peak\nfluxes, since this is the shortest timescale on which this peak flux can be measured.\n\nFIGURE 2. Fluence vs. p1024 for the Three GRB Classes.\n\nFigure 3 overlays log(T90) contours for Class 1 GRBs on the fluence vs. 1024 ms\npeak flux space. The contours demonstrate that GRBs can be modeled as a series\nof pulses, with pulses containing most of the fluence and interpulse separations\nprimarily defining the duration. Most Class 2 bursts are single-pulsed events as\n\n\fmeasured on the 1024 ms timescale. This helps define the characteristics of the\nthird distinct region outside of which no GRBs are found: high fluence, faint Class\n1 GRBs are missing, whereas low fluence faint, Class 1 GRBs are present. Since a\nbias favoring detection of GRBs with few photons over those with many photons\nseems unlikely, we suspect a bias capable of underestimating fluence relative to\npeak flux.\n\nFIGURE 3. Fluence vs. p1024 for Class 1 GRBs; contours indicate regions of constant log(T90).\n\nWe have dimmed a number of bright GRBs to where they just trigger in order to\nstudy their measured properties as they fade into background. Each burst's peak\nflux is dimmed, and the time history is \"noisified\" with a Poisson background. The\npeak flux and fluence are then re-measured. These actions have been performed\nten times on five bright bursts with a range of temporal structures.\nOne problem quickly became apparent during the analysis: the time interval\nbounding the fluence measurement (the fluence duration [4]) strongly influenced\nthe amount of fluence measured. If the same fluence duration interval was used for\nundimmed and dimmed measurements, then the fluence-to-peak flux ratio did not\nchange as a GRB was dimmed. If, however, the fluence duration interval shortened\nto account for faint pulses disappearing into the background and becoming unrecognizable, then the fluence-to-peak flux ratio decreased as the burst dimmed (see\nFigure 4). This bias becomes stronger near the trigger threshold.\nFluence durations taken from BATSE Catalogs provide supportive evidence for\nthis mechanism. The durations used to calculate fluence of faint Class 1 GRBs are\nshorter than those of bright Class 1 GRBs [4].\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA mechanism exists whereby some Class 1 (Long) GRBs can develop Class 3\n(Intermediate) characteristics via a combination of the hardness intensity relation\n\n\fFIGURE 4. Five bright Class 1 GRBs, decremented in peak flux, noisified, with remeasured\nfluences and peak fluxes. It has been assumed that the GRB duration is measured from identifiable\npulses, which become harder to recognize as the peak flux becomes fainter.\n\nand the fluence duration bias. Faint Class 1 GRBs are most likely to develop Class\n3 characteristics, but it is possible for even bright GRBs with appropriate time histories and spectral features to develop these characteristics. Class 3 (Intermediate)\nGRBs do not therefore appear to represent a separate source population, although\nthey cluster in the duration, fluence, hardness, attribute space. Class 2 (Short)\nGRBs do appear to represent a separate source population. We were unable to find\na mechanism by which faint Class 1 GRBs could develop Class 2 characteristics.\nGRB population studies can benefit from use of AI classifiers. There are many\nother attributes developed by the community that could be included for future\nstudy. To this end, we are designing a web-based AI tool for GRB classification [3]\nthat includes supervised and unsupervised AI classifiers [9].\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n\nBand, D.
