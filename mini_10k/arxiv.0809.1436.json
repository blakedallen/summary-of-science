INTRODUCTION\n\n\f2\n\nSlesnick et al.\n\nidentify young stars, many observational signatures (e.g.,\nH\u03b1 emission or near-infrared excess) probe accretion processes and circumstellar material rather than characteristics intrinsic to the stars themselves.\nRecently, deep, multicolor imaging surveys combined\nwith spectroscopic follow-up have proven successful in\nidentifying low mass stars and brown dwarfs without active accretion, as well as classical T-Tauri type objects.\nYoung pre-main sequence (PMS) objects still undergoing\ncontraction are cooler (i.e., redder in color) and/or more\nluminous (i.e., brighter in magnitude) than their main\nsequence counterparts. In nearby regions, candidate\nPMS stars can be identified through photometric colors\nand magnitudes that are systematically different from\nthose of the bulk field star population. Spectroscopic\nfollow-up observations allow assessment of surface gravity diagnostics which can be used to distinguish bonafide\nyoung PMS stars from foreground field dwarfs and reddened background giants. Previous imaging and spectroscopic surveys in USco include studies by Preibisch et al.\n(2001) and Preibisch et al. (2002), whose work yielded\n166 new low mass PMS objects. Lodieu et al. (2008),\nMart\u0131\u0301n et al. (2004), and Ardila et al. (2000) together\nidentified \u223c70 members of USco with spectral type M6\nor later. Thus far, over 400 low mass (M <0.6 M\u2299 )\nmembers have been identified in USco through X-rays,\nH\u03b1 emission, photometry and/or spectroscopy. However, most searches have been limited to small subregions\n(smaller than a few square degrees) or bright objects (R\n. 16 mag). Given the derived mass function and number\nof observed high mass stars in USco, and assuming the\nhigh and low mass objects share the same spatial distribution, Preibisch et al. (2002) estimate the entire USco\nregion should contain >1500 young, low mass objects\nwith M <0.6 M\u2299 , most of which are yet to be discovered.\nIn Slesnick, Carpenter, & Hillenbrand (2006a; hereafter Paper I), we introduced our wide-field photometric survey covering \u223c150 deg2 of USco. In that work,\nwe presented optical spectroscopic observations of 62\nphotometrically-selected candidate PMS stars, of which\n43 were confirmed by us to be new USco members. In this\ncompanion paper we present spectra for an additional\n178 candidates observed at either Palomar Observatory\nor Cerro-Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). In\n\u00a72, we give a brief overview of the photometric and spectroscopic surveys, and present new USco members discovered as a result of recent observations. For the remainder of the paper beyond \u00a72, we discuss results for\nnew members presented here together with those for association members identified in Paper I. In \u00a73, we discuss\nH\u03b1 emission profiles and accretion signatures in USco. In\n\u00a74, we compare the spatial distribution of the high and\nlow mass populations. Finally, in \u00a75, we construct an\nHertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram and present a discussion of the age and mass distributions derived for the\nmembers of USco presented in our work, as well as a\ncomparison of distributions derived for other nearby star\nforming regions.\n2. OBSERVATIONS\n2.1. Quest-2 Photometric Observations and Candidate\n\nMember Selection\n\nDriftscan observations were taken with the Quest-2\ncamera (Rabinowitz et al. 2003, Baltay et al. 2007) on\nthe 48-inch (1.2-m) Samuel Oschin Schmidt Telescope\nat Palomar Observatory. Details of the observations and\ndata analysis are given in Paper I, Slesnick, et al. (2006b;\nhereafter SCH06), and Slesnick (2007). Three 4.\u25e6 6 wide\nscans, centered at \u03b4=-15.\u25e6 7, -19.\u25e6 5, and -23.\u25e6 3, were each\nobserved between R.A. of 15h46m and 16h36m for a\ntotal survey area of \u223c150 deg2 . The scan centered at\n\u03b4 = \u221219.5\u25e6 was observed 3\u20134 times per night on seven\nconsecutive, photometric nights between 2004 June 2026. The other two scans were observed once during this\nperiod.\nB, R, I photometric data were calibrated to a system\nclosely aligned with Sloan g, r, i magnitudes as described\nin SCH06 and Slesnick (2007). Magnitudes for all the\nnew USco members identified in this study (based on a\ncombination of photometry and spectroscopy; see \u00a72.4),\nboth those newly identified in this work and those identified originally in Paper I, are given in Table 1. Our\ngoal is to use the photometry to isolate PMS stars from\nthe field star population which dominates the \u223c2 million\nmember source catalog. As discussed in \u00a71, nearby young\nstars occupy a sequence in an optical color-magnitude\ndiagram (CMD) that is systematically brighter and/or\nredder than the sequence occupied by most field stars,\nand thus can be identified based on their colors and\nmagnitudes. While the data have been calibrated to\napproximate Sloan magnitudes [see Slesnick (2007) for\nmore details], they are not precisely on any standard system, and we did not translate theoretical isochrones into\nthe Quest-2 system. Thus, we did not select candidates\nbased on isochronal data and instead, considered as candidate PMS stars all sources redward of a linear approximation of the 1% data contour in an r, r \u2212 i CMD (Figure 1). This criterion roughly corresponds to selecting\nall candidates redward of a 30 Myr isochrone.\nIn addition to optical colors, the infrared colors and\nmagnitudes of potential PMS candidates were also considered. We matched the entire source catalog to the 2\nMicron All Sky Survey (2MASS; Skrutskie et al. 2006)\nand excluded from further consideration sources which\ndid not have a 2MASS counterpart. This criteria served\nto remove artifacts detected in the 2 driftscans for which\nwe did not have repeated observations. However, as discussed in Paper I and SCH06, requiring a 2MASS detection biases the list of potential PMS candidates against\nfaint blue sources. The position of each star on a nearinfrared color-color diagram was examined and any star\nwith J \u2212 H, H \u2212 KS colors consistent with those of background giants [(J \u2212 H) > 0.6(H \u2212 KS )+ 0.6 or (J \u2212 H) >\n1.69(H \u2212 KS ) + 0.29); Bessell & Brett (1988)] was excluded. We additionally considered r \u2212 KS colors and\nadopted the selection criterion r < 2.57(r\u2212KS \u22123)+12.8\nas outlined in Paper I. After all selection criteria were applied, the final candidate list contained \u223c1700 candidate\nlow mass PMS stars identified from \u223c2 million sources\ndetected in the Quest-2 survey. Of these stars, 90 correspond to previously known low mass members of USco\n(Ardila et al. 2000, Preibisch et al. 2002, Mart\u0131\u0301n et al.\n2004). The candidates were spread out over the entire\n\u223c150 deg2 survey area, which encompasses \u223c40% of the\ntotal spatial area spanned by the high mass members.\nDue to interstellar extinction and distance effects, op-\n\n\fAge/Mass Distribution in USco\ntical and near-infrared colors and magnitudes alone are\nnot a unique indicator of youth. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain spectroscopic follow-up observations for\neach photometrically-selected candidate. This data allows for spectral type determination and can confirm the\npresence of spectral features indicative of youth.\n2.2. Palomar Spectroscopy\nModerate-resolution spectra of 105 PMS star candidates were taken with the Double Spectrograph on the\nPalomar 200-inch telescope during the nights of 2006\nMay 16\u201319 and 2006 June 1-2. All data were taken with\nthe red side of the spectrograph through either the 1.5\"\nor the 2\" slit using a 5500 \u00c5 dichroic and a 316 lines\nmm\u22121 grating blazed at 7500 \u00c5. This set-up produced\nwavelength coverage from 6300 to 8825 \u00c5 at a resolution\nof R \u223c1250. Typical exposure times were 300\u2013900 sec,\nand up to 1800 sec for the faintest targets (r \u223c20). Spectrophotometric standard stars (Massey et al. 1988) were\nobserved throughout each night for flux calibration. All\nsources were processed, extracted and calibrated using\nstandard IRAF tasks.\nSpectral analysis for these observations were carried\nout as detailed in Paper I, SCH06, and Slesnick (2007).\nBoth spectral type (temperature) and surface gravity\n(age) determinations were first made through quantitative measurements of the TiO-7140, TiO-8465, and\nNa-8190 indices (defined in Paper I) which measure the\nstrength of molecular and atomic absorption features\npresent at optical wavelengths in the spectra of K- and\nM-type stars. Figure 2 shows spectral indices for 167\nPMS spectral candidates in the USco region observed at\nPalomar (105 presented here for the first time and 62 presented in Paper I). The left panel shows measurements\nof temperature-sensitive indices used to aid in spectral\ntype determination. We find fourteen outliers sit below\nthe main locus of data points. In all cases, the star is confirmed to exhibit low gravity signatures (see below) and\nwe attribute the position in Figure 2 to a small amount of\nveiling or reddening. A detailed explanation of the possible effects of these processes on the classification indices\nis given in Paper I and SCH06.\nThe surface gravity-sensitive Na-8190 index (Figure 2,\nright panel) allows us to easily separate the bona fide\nlow gravity (i.e., young) objects from contaminant dwarfs\nstars over the spectral-type range \u223cM3\u2013M8. We find\na large fraction (\u223c65%) of the candidate objects have\nmeasured Na-8190 indices consistent with their having\nsurface gravity less than that of field dwarfs at similar\nspectral types. The TiO and Na quantitative spectral\nindices were used to aid in classification only. All final\nspectral type and gravity determination were done by\nvisually comparing each spectrum to a grid of spectral\nstandard stars observed throughout the observing run.\n2.3. Cerro Tololo Spectroscopy\n\nAdditional spectra of PMS star candidates in USco\nwere taken at CTIO using the Hydra multifiber spectrograph on the Blanco 4-m telescope during the nights\nof 2005 July 24\u201328. In total, 26 pointings were observed\nwith the Site 2k\u00d74k CCD through the KPGLF grating.\nThe setup provided wavelength coverage from \u223c6300 to\n8660 \u00c5 at a resolution of 1.15 \u00c5/pixel.\n\n3\n\nFibers were placed preferentially on stars meeting the\ncriteria outlined in \u00a72.1, thus providing a sample of candidates analogous to those observed at Palomar. Remaining fibers were placed on stars meeting one or more of the\ncriteria outlined in \u00a72.1. For the practical requirements\nof the Hydra observations, stars were assigned to either\n'bright' pointings (corresponding to r . 16.5) or 'faint'\npointings (corresponding to 16.5 . r . 18.5). Exposure\ntimes ranged from 900 to 1800 sec for bright pointings\n(dependent on weather conditions), and were set at 2700\nsec for faint pointings. In total, 10 bright and 16 faint\npointings were observed during the 5 nights. At each\nfiber configuration, we observed spectra of a comparison lamp and a quartz lamp to allow determination of\nthe dispersion solution and throughput correction during data reduction. Biases and dome flats were taken\neach afternoon with all working fibers put in the 'large\ncircle' configuration. Milk flats (see below) were taken\nonce during the observing run.\n2.3.1. Image Processing and Sky Subtraction\n\nAll frames were first pre-processed (bias correction and\ntrimming) in IRAF using the CCDPROC task. Milk flats\nwere obtained on the second afternoon of observing. This\ntype of observation is an exposure of the daytime sky, and\nis taken through a plate of milky glass placed between\nthe output of the fibers and the spectrograph camera.\nThe purpose of milk flats is to allow removal of CCD\npixel-to-pixel variations from the data in the absence of\nfibers. After median-combining all observed milk flats,\na spectral response image was created by smoothing in\nboth X and Y directions. The original combined milk\nflat was divided by the spectral response image to create\nan image with a value of 1.0 everywhere except where\npixel-to-pixel variations exist. All data and calibration\nframes were divided by this image.\nSubsequent data reduction was done using the IRAF\ndohydra task. All data for a given night were divided\nby the dome flat taken that afternoon. Individual fiberto-fiber throughput corrections (which change for each\nconfiguration) were made from division of each object\nframe by the corresponding quartz lamp spectra taken\nin the same fiber configuration. Wavelength calibration\nwas carried out by matching each object spectrum to the\ncorresponding lamp spectrum observed through the same\nfiber.\nFor each pointing, a single sky spectrum was made using the sky generating tasks within dohydra. Typically,\n\u223c5\u201320 fibers were placed on sky during each observation.\nThe dohydra sky generating task first allows rejection of\nany anomalous sky spectra which may have inadvertently\nfallen on a star or a clump of nebulosity. Remaining sky\nspectra are averaged together using a 3\u03c3 clipping algorithm. The hydra field of view is 40' on a side. We\nfound subtraction of a single sky spectrum for all spectra within a field often produced insufficient sky subtraction in that, for a given spectrum, all sky lines could be\nsystematically over- or under-subtracted. To correct this\nproblem, for each spectrum we computed the flux in a\nsingle sky line chosen to be towards the center of the\nspectrum (\u223c7316 \u00c5) and to be sufficiently isolated that\nit was not blended with any other sky or stellar lines.\nObject spectra were scaled such that the flux computed\nin the central sky line matched that of the sky spectrum\n\n\f4\n\nSlesnick et al.\n\nand the sky spectrum was subsequently subtracted.\n2.3.2. Classification\n\nSpectral observations taken through fibers produce flux\nthat varies as a function of wavelength, dependent on the\nfiber configuration (i.e., how the relevant fiber is bent and\nstretched to place it into position on the star). Thus, flux\ncorrection of fiber data is inherently difficult because it is\nnot practical to observe a calibrator star through every\nfiber at every configuration. We were therefore not able\nto flux-correct the hydra spectra in a manner analogous\nto the Palomar data and could not use the quantitative\nspectral indices (which rely on flux-corrected spectra) to\naid in classification. Though the overall spectral shape\nis not meaningful because the spectra are not flux corrected, the depth of absorption and emission features is\nnot substantially affected. During observations, we observed a range of known dwarf and giant stars (spectral types K0\u2013M8). In addition, we observed known\nintermediate-age PMS members of the \u223c30 Myr-old Tucanae Hor association (Mamajek et al. 2004) with early\nM spectral types. Spectra of previously identified K0\u2013\nM8-type USco members were observed in pointings towards USco along with program candidates. All spectra\nof candidate PMS stars were classified by hand through\ncomparison to each other and to standard stars observed\nwith hydra.\nIn total, the hydra observations yielded \u223c1150 spectra\n(of varying quality). We first classified all of the spectra\ninto broad categories. Approximately 450 were determined to be mid K to M 'late-type' stars based on the\npresence of TiO molecular absorption in their spectra,\nand a lack of H\u03b1 absorption. The largest constituent of\nthe spectral sample (\u223c650 stars) were 'mid-type' stars\nwith spectral types late F through early K. These stars\nare characterized by a lack of TiO molecular absorption\nbut the presence of Ca II triplet (\u03bb8498, \u03bb8542 ,\u03bb8662\n\u00c5) and H\u03b1 atomic absorption. Absorption from the Ba\nII, Fe I, Ca I blend at \u03bb6497 \u00c5 begins to appear at late\nF/early G types and increases in strength compared to\nH\u03b1 absorption through K spectral types. Thirty of the\nlate F \u2013 early K type stars have H\u03b1 emission present in\ntheir spectra. The remaining \u223c50 stars observed with\nhydra were determined to have spectral types A\u2013F with\ndeep H\u03b1 and Ca II triplet absorption but noticeably lacking any absorption at the \u03bb6497 \u00c5 blend. As expected,\nwe saw no evidence of He absorption in any of the spectra\nand conclude that our survey did not probe B- or O-type\nstars.\nMagnitude histograms for the samples of observed\n'mid-type' and 'late-type' stars are shown at r- and Jband (Figure 3), along with the range of magnitudes expected for members of USco at these spectral types. We\nhave assumed for this calculation that all members of\nUSco are 5 Myr-old, 145 pc away, and have 0 \u2264 AV \u2264 2\n(Paper I). As can been seen, most of the stars classified as\nmid-type do not appear to be members of USco based on\ntheir observed magnitudes and spectral types. This sample is instead likely dominated by reddened field dwarfs\nand background giants. This result is not surprising, considering most of these stars were observed through fibers\nplaced on stars in the field of view that did not meet all\n3 criteria for candidate selection (see \u00a72.3 and \u00a72.1), and\n\nwere not part of the \u223c1700-member candidate list.\nThus far, we have derived detailed (at the \u223c0.5 subclass level) classifications from these data only for those\nstars whose colors and magnitudes meet all of the selection criteria outlined in Paper I and SCH06, thus providing a sample selected in exactly the same manner as the\nstars observed at Palomar. This sample was determined\nto consist entirely of late K- and M-type stars, \u223c50% of\nwhich have low surface gravity consistent with association membership. We present here results for these stars\ntogether with results from the Palomar spectral observations.\n2.4. Summary of Observations\nWe identified a total of \u223c2 million sources in the \u223c150\ndeg2 area covered by the Quest-2 imaging survey of the\nnorthern part of USco. The survey encompassed 56 out\nof 120 high mass association members identified with\nHipparcos (de Zeeuw et al. 1999), and \u223c40% of the total\nspatial area spanned by the high mass members. Using a combination of Quest-2 g, r, i and 2MASS J, H, KS\nmagnitudes, we selected \u223c1700 candidate young stars\nbased on placement in color-color and color-magnitude\ndiagrams. Specifically, to be considered as a candidate\nPMS star, the object was required to be within the reddest 1% (in r \u2212 i color) of stars observed in our survey,\nand to have infrared colors inconsistent with field giants.\nWe obtained optical spectra for \u223c15% of the photometric candidates selected to be amoung the reddest of\nthe photometric candidates across all magnitudes (14.\nr .20) probed. The goal of the spectroscopic observations is to measure spectral type and confirm low gravity signatures consistant with bona fide PMS stars for\neach photometric candidate. From the 105 Palomar spectral observations presented here (\u00a72.2), we identified 66\nnew USco members with spectral types ranging from\nM3 to M8. We present an additional 36 new members\nwith spectral types M3-M8 identified from CTIO observations. Quest-2 and 2MASS magnitudes for photometric candidates determined spectroscopically to be field\ndwarfs are given in Table 3.\nFor the remainder of this paper, we will discuss together results from both the 102 new low mass USco\nmembers presented here, and the 43 members presented\nin Paper I. Magnitudes and spectral measurements (i.e.,\nspectral type, H\u03b1 equivalent width, and spectral indices,\nwhen applicable) for the 145 members identified by us are\ngiven in Table 1. Together, these stars represent a uniformly selected sample of new low mass USco members\nthat is free from bias in regards to circumstellar material\nand activity.\n3. EMISSION LINE OBJECTS\n\nThe most prominent emission line observed in the spectra of new members is H\u03b1 which, seen in the spectra\nof young stars and brown dwarfs, is created via one of\nseveral mechanisms. Weak, narrow H\u03b1 lines are presumed to originate from active chromospheres whereas\nstrong, broad and/or asymmetric lines can be produced\nfrom high-velocity, infalling accretion or strong winds.\nBarrado y Navascu\u00e9s & Mart\u0131\u0301n (2003) have proposed an\nempirical, spectral type-H\u03b1 equivalent width (W (H\u03b1 ))\nrelation to describe the upper limit of non-accreting stars\nand brown dwarfs based on the chromospheric satura-\n\n\fAge/Mass Distribution in USco\ntion limit observed in the Pleiades, \u03b1 Per, and IC 2391\nopen clusters. These clusters are sufficiently old (50\u2013125\nMyr) that accretion should not be present, and any observed H\u03b1 emission is assumed to be produced entirely\nfrom chromospheric activity. Figure 4 plots measured\nH\u03b1 equivalent widths as a function of spectral type for\nthe 145 members of USco presented here, shown with\nthe Barrado y Navascu\u00e9s & Mart\u0131\u0301n (2003) empirical accretor/nonaccretor division. Notably, every new member identified in our work shows H\u03b1 in emission. Many\nstars and brown dwarfs exhibit very strong H\u03b1 emission\n(see also Table 1) at levels substantially above the accretor/nonaccretor division, and thus are possibly still\nundergoing active accretion.\nWe determined an empirical criterion for identifying\nobjects with H\u03b1 excess emission based on our data. At\nan age of \u223c5 Myr, we assume the bulk of our sample\nis no longer accreting and compute median values of H\u03b1\nemission as a function of spectral type using 1-sigma clipping to remove any bias from outliers. For most bins, we\ndefine a star to have an H\u03b1 excess if it exhibits emission\nat a level greater than 3\u03c3 above the median value for its\nspectral type, where \u03c3 is the dispersion about the median\nfor stars at a given spectral type. Stars with such strong\nH\u03b1 emission are likely to be accreting and are assumed\nsuch for the remainder of this work. These sources are\ndistinguished on Figure 4. For spectral type bins earlier than M4 and later than M7, we have identified fewer\nthan 5 stars per spectral type. Thus, for these bins we do\nnot have enough measurements to derive a statistically\nrepresentative value for median H\u03b1 emission and we do\nnot consider any stars in these bins to be in our sample of\nH\u03b1 excess, accreting sources. However, we note that two\nM8 stars (including the possible binary discussed in Paper I \u00a74.2) sit above the Barrado y Navascu\u00e9s & Mart\u0131\u0301n\n(2003) accretor/nonaccretor dividing line.\nBased on the above criterion, we find 15 objects\nto exhibit H\u03b1 emission with sufficient strength to be\nconsidered by us to be actively accreting.\nSpectra for accreting stars and brown dwarfs are shown\nin Figure 5. In addition to H\u03b1 emission, many of\nthese stars (SCH J16014156-21113855, SCH J1622215622173094, SCH J16150524-24593542, SCH J1603347018293060, SCH J16075565-24432714, SCH J1628470624281413, SCH J16103876-18292353, SCH J1611073922285027, SCH J16060391-20564497) also exhibit He I\n(6678 \u00c5) emission which is commonly seen in spectra of\nclassical T-Tauri type objects. Two accreting sources lie\nvery close (within \u223c1\u25e6 ) to the young (.1 Myr) \u03c1 Ophiuchi molecular cloud (\u03c1Oph; \u03b1=16 25 35.118, \u03b4= -23\n26 49.84 J2000). However, because \u03c1 Oph lies slightly\nin front of USco (Loinard et al. 2008), if these stars were\ndynamically ejected \u03c1 Oph members, we would expect to\nsee them exhibit systematically higher luminosities than\nUSco members of similar spectral type. Based on the\nderived HR diagram from these data (see \u00a75.1) this phenomenon is not observed, and we include these two stars\nin our sample of accreting members of USco. We find\nat an age of \u223c5 Myr (see \u00a75.2), 15/145 (or \u223c10+3\n\u22123 %)\nof low mass association members (spectral type \u2264M7\nand \u2265M4) are observed to be accreting based on the\nstrength of H\u03b1 emission present in their spectra. If we\nwere to use the Barrado y Navascu\u00e9s & Mart\u0131\u0301n (2003)\n\n5\n\naccretion boundary instead of our own empirical classification, we would have determined 23/145 (16%) low\nmass stars and brown dwarfs in our sample are still accreting. In comparison, Guieu et al. (2006) find \u223c65%\n(20/31) of 1 Myr-old low mass objects in the subclusters of Taurus to be actively accreting based on the\nstrength of H\u03b1 emission observed in their spectra compared to the Barrado y Navascu\u00e9s & Mart\u0131\u0301n (2003) accretion boundary. Thus, a significant fraction of very\nlow mass stars and brown dwarfs must stop accreting\nbetween 1 and 5 Myr. This conclusion is consistent with\na median accretion lifetime of \u223c2\u20133 Myr for higher mass\nstars (Haisch et al. 2001, Hillenbrand 2005).\n4. SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF LOW MASS STARS\n\nFigure 6 shows the 2D spatial distribution of the 120\nhigh mass members of USco identified in the Hipparcos\nsurvey (de Zeeuw et al. 1999). This sample represents\nthe complete population of known members more massive than \u223c1 M\u2299 . The density of high mass stars is\nroughly constant from 237. \u03b1 .249\u25e6 and peaks at \u03b4 \u223c24\u25e6 . As can be seen, despite the large area of the Quest-2\nsurvey, it still encompassed only the central \u223c13\u25e6 in RA\nand the northern \u223c12\u25e6 in DEC of the association.\nIn general, the low mass PMS stars presented here\nshare a common spatial distribution with the high mass\nHipparcos members. Efforts to observe northwest of\nthe Hipparcos stars largely yielded reddened field dwarfs\nrather than young association members. To correct for\nbias in the spatial area we observed spectroscopically,\nwe first computed the percent of photometric candidates\nthat we observed spectroscopically, in 1-degree bins, as\na function of right ascension and declination. We found\nthat we observed spectroscopically a maximum of \u223c25%\nof the photometric candidates with a given degree-wide\nspatial bin. We thus corrected every bin to a uniform\n25% of candidates observed, and calculated the number\nof members we would have detected assuming we had\nobserved 25% of the photometric candidates in each bin,\nand that the percentage of identified members relative to\nthe number of stars observed spectroscopically at each\nspatial bin would remain unchanged. Figure 7 shows the\nresultant 1D spatial distributions for the low mass association members discussed here, together with those for\nthe 56 Hipparcos stars that fall within our survey area.\nWe conclude that the density of low mass association\nmembers found in the Quest-2 survey is roughly uniform\nin RA, and peaks at \u03b4 \u223c-25\u25e6 with stellar densities falling\noff beyond these values. We find no evidence for spatial\nsegregation by mass in USco within the northern portion\nof the association.\n5. AGE AND MASS DISTRIBUTIONS\n5.1. HR Diagram for New USco Members\n\nIn this section, we combine the spectral type and photometry of each new member to derive values for its\nluminosity and effective temperature, and place it onto\nan HR diagram. As described in \u00a72.1, the final Quest2 photometry is not on a standard magnitude system.\nThus, because of the reliability and uniformity of the\n2MASS survey, we chose to use J-band magnitudes and\n(J \u2212 H) colors to derive luminosities. An empirical fit\nto BCJ as a function of spectral type was determined\nfrom the observational data of Leggett et al. (1996) and\n\n\f6\n\nSlesnick et al.\n\nLeggett et al. (2002) (spectral types M1-M6.5 and M6L3, respectively). We derived intrinsic colors, extinction,\nand effective temperatures using the methods described\nin Slesnick et al. (2004).\nIn Figure 8, we present an HR diagram for the 145 low\nmass members of USco that we identified, shown with\nPMS model tracks and isochrones. The most commonly\nused PMS models for low mass stars and brown dwarfs\nare those derived by D'Antona & Mazzitelli (1997) (hereafter DM97) and Baraffe et al. (1998), which differ primarily in their atmospheric approximations and treatment of convection. Both models suggest similar mass\nranges for our data of 0.02M\u2299 < M < 0.2M\u2299 , though\npredicted masses for individual objects can vary by\nup to 0.09M\u2299 (60%). We have found that the slope\nof the DM97 isochrones provide a reasonable match\nto the derived HR diagram, whereas the Baraffe et al.\n(1998) models predict systematically younger stars at\nlower masses. A similar result was also noted by\nHillenbrand et al. (2008). These authors compared the\nslope of six different theoretical PMS isochrones as a\nfunction of binary fraction, and found that, assuming\nan intermediate binary fraction consistent with observations (e.g., Kraus et al. 2008), the DM97 models provide\nthe best match to the observed HR diagram slope for\nstars in USco. Thus, for the remainder of this work, we\nuse the DM97 mass tracks and isochrones to derive mass\nand age for stars in our sample. All derived quantities\nare given in Table 2.\n5.2. Age Distribution of the Low Mass Population in\n\nUSco\nLiteral interpretation of the derived HR diagram (Figure 8) reveals a population with median age of \u223c4.1\nMyr, and a continuous spread of ages over &10 Myr.\nWhile this result may be real, the continuous nature\nof the observed age distribution in USco could also\nbe produced from uncertainties in observed parameters.\nUnlike the HR diagram, the observed surface gravitysensitive spectral features do not show evidence for a\nlarge spread in age between association members. Figure 9 shows spectra of two stars with spectral type M5\nidentified in the survey. The top spectrum is that of the\n'youngest' M5 star observed spectroscopically at Palomar\n(SCH16054416-21550566), \u223c2.6 Myr-old based on its location on the HR diagram (see also Table 2); the bottom\nspectrum is of the 'oldest' M5 star observed at Palomar\n(SCH16162599-21122315), \u223c14.4 Myr based on its location on the HR diagram. As discussed in SCH06 and\nSlesnick (2007), young stars less than a few megayears\nold exhibit systematically less Na I (\u03bb8190 \u00c5) absorption than do intermediate-age stars (\u223c5\u201310 Myr) due to\ntheir lower surface gravity (see Figure 10 in Paper I and\nFigure 6 in SCH06). Thus, if the derived ages from the\nHR diagram are correct, the spectrum of the 14.4 Myrold star should have noticeably stronger Na I absorption. For example, an M5 star at 1\u20135 Myr would have\na Na-8190 index 5\u201310% larger than that observed for an\nM5 star at 10 Myr. The spectra presented in Figure 9\nare nearly identical (and have near-identical measured\nNa-8190 indices of 0.89 and 0.90). Based on analysis of\nspectral features, we classified these two stars as being\nroughly the same age. However, based on the differences\nin observed luminosity, interpreting the HR diagram lit-\n\nerally, one would infer an age spread of >10 Myr between\nthe two stars.\n5.2.1. Comparison of the Observed Age Distribution to\n\na Coeval Population\nDue to the discrepancy between stellar ages derived\nfrom the HR diagram compared to those inferred from\nspectral surface gravity signatures, we sought to determine the statistical significance of the observed spread\nin ages for stars on the HR diagram. Effective temperatures and luminosities shown in Figure 8 are derived\nfrom observed J magnitudes, J \u2212 H colors, and spectral types. The age and mass of a star are inferred from\neffective temperature and luminosity using a set of theoretical isochrones and mass tracks. Thus, uncertainties\nin measured photometry or spectral type are propagated\ninto uncertainties in mass and age. Variations in distance and binarity can cause additional uncertainty in\nluminosity, and, hence, quantities derived from the HR\ndiagram.\nWe explore first the possibility that the USco population could be coeval, and the apparent age spread in\nthe HR diagram is a result of observational uncertainties combined with association depth and binarity effects. Using a similar method to that used in this work,\nPreibisch & Zinnecker (1999) compute an age of \u223c5 Myr\nfor the intermediate-mass members of USco. We used\nMonte Carlo techniques to generate a coeval population\nof 5 Myr-old stars and brown dwarfs at a distance of\n145 pc. The input spectral type distribution was selected to mirror that of our observed distribution of stars,\nwith 1000 stars simulated for every star observed. For\neach star in the simulated population, J- and H-band\nmagnitudes were varied by adding random offsets drawn\nfrom a Gaussian distribution with a 1-sigma deviation of\n0.025 mag, corresponding to the average uncertainty in\nthe 2MASS photometry for observed stars. To mimic\nthe magnitude-limited data sample, we did not allow\nany star to be simulated below the photometric survey\nlimits (J=16 and H=15.5). Similarly, a random offset\nwas added to the assumed spectral type, selected from a\nGaussian distribution with 1-sigma errors of 0.5 spectral\nsubtypes corresponding to the qualitative error of the\noptical spectral type determinations. Simulated spectral types were rounded to the nearest 0.25 subclasses\nto reflect the discreet nature of spectral type classification for new members discovered in our work. Using the\nnew spectral type, for each simulated star, we re-derived\nthe expected effective temperature, bolometric correction\nand intrinsic J \u2212 H color using the methods described in\nSlesnick et al. (2004).\nThe maximum distance spread (derived from secular parallax measurements) among members of the\nassociation with Hipparcos measurements is 50 pc\n(Preibisch et al. 2002; de Bruijne 1999). In the simulation, we assumed a uniform spatial distribution over\na box of this depth centered at 145 pc. A 33% binary fraction for stars across all simulated spectral types\n(M3\u2013M8) was assumed, consistent with observational\nresults of the binary frequency for low mass members\nof USco (Kraus et al. 2008, Kraus et al. 2005). All\nobserved low mass binaries in USco have near equal\nmasses (msecondary /mprimary &0.6; Kraus et al. 2005),\nand thus, the assumption was made that all binaries were\n\n\fAge/Mass Distribution in USco\ncomposed of two equal mass stars. This assumption is\nsomewhat liberal in that it will produce the largest possible dispersion in luminosity.\nWe compare quantitatively results of this simulation\nto the observed data in Figure 10. The red shaded\nhistogram shows the age distribution derived from the\nMonte Carlo simulation, overplotted with a histogram\nof ages for the data (black hatched histogram). Both\nhistograms have been normalized to unity at the peak\nfor comparison, and all stars with log(Tef f ) <3.4 (beyond which interpolation of the isochrones becomes unreliable) have been excluded from the data and the model\nresults. The widths of the distributions are remarkably similar, given the simplistic nature of the Monte\nCarlo simulation. For the simulated association, we find\na mean apparent age of log(age)=6.51\u00b10.40 whereas\nfor the data (not including the 3 M8 stars) we find a\nmean age of log(age)=6.53\u00b10.47. The data and the\nmodel differ significantly at the distribution tails, which\nis most likely caused either by an incorrect assumption\nof one of the model parameters, or by an inherent problem with the theoretical isochrones at very low masses\n(Hillenbrand & White 2004). To quantitatively assess\nhow well the model reproduces the bulk of the data, excluding the distribution tails, we applied a \u03c72 test of\nthe central peaks of the distributions from log(age)=6.0\nto log(age)=7.4. This test yields a \u223c53% probability\nthat the two distributions could have been drawn from\nthe same population. Thus, given the uncertainties, the\ndata are consistent with most stars in USco forming via\na single burst \u223c5 Myr ago.\nThis result is somewhat surprising given the large extent of the association (\u223c35 pc across). Assuming a\nsound speed of cS =0.2 km/s consistent with a T=10 K\nmolecular cloud, and assuming the stars formed close\nto where they are observed today, the sound crossing\ntime for the parental molecular cloud is \u223c85 Myr. Thus,\none end of the cloud could not have 'communicated' to\nthe other in time to create a simultaneous burst of star\nformation. This result does not, however, rule out the\npossibility that star formation happened simultaneously\nthroughout the extent of the cloud because every part independently reached the threshold for star formation at\nthe same time. Another scenario is that the stars formed\nmuch closer together and have since spread to their current positions. However, this possibility can be ruled out\nfrom simple arguments. The velocity dispersion of the\nmassive Hipparcos members is \u223c1.3 km/s (de Bruijne\n1999). In 5 Myr, the furthest an association member\ncould travel at a speed of 1.3 km/s is \u223c6.5 pc, less than\nhalf the radius of the current association.\nA similar discrepancy between a small observed age\nspread and the large spatial extent of the association has\nalso been noted in the literature for USco's intermediate\nand high mass members (Preibisch & Zinnecker 1999).\nTo explain the disparity, Preibisch & Zinnecker (1999)\n(and later Preibisch & Zinnecker 2007) proposed a scenario in which star formation in USco was triggered by an\nexternal event in the form of a supernova explosion in the\nneighboring Upper Centaurus-Lupus association (\u223c70 pc\naway and \u223c17 Myr-old). They argue based on the structure and kinematics of large H I loops surrounding Sco\nCen, that such an event is evidenced to have occurred\n\u223c12 Myr ago. If true, the explosion would have driven\n\n7\n\na shock wave that would have reached USco about \u223c5\nMyr ago, consistent with the inferred age of USco's stellar population. Our results may imply a similar small\nage spread with an association age \u223c5 Myr and large\nspatial extent (see \u00a74) for USco's lowest mass stars and\nsubstellar members. While our results do not prove the\nPreibisch & Zinnecker (1999) hypothesis true, they do\ngive support to the hypothesis' plausibility, and extend\nits validity to even the lowest mass association members.\n5.2.2. Comparison of the Observed Age Distribution to\n\na Uniform Distribution\nFrom the simulation discussd in \u00a75.2.1, we have determined the observed age distribution in USco is consistent\nwith all stars forming in a single burst 5 Myr ago. We\nexplore also the maximum age spread that can be inferred from our data assuming that the star formation\nrate has been constant in time. We repeated the original\nMonte Carlo simulation allowing age to vary in addition\nto spectral type, photometric error, distance and binarity. We began with a 5 Myr population, and for each\nstar added a random offset in age drawn from a uniform\npopulation between \u00b10.5 Myr, \u00b11 Myr, \u00b11.5 Myr, \u00b12\nMyr, \u00b12.5 Myr, \u00b13 Myr, \u00b13.5 Myr, \u00b14 Myr, \u00b14.5 Myr,\nor \u00b15 Myr. This age offset had the effect of changing\nthe starting J and H magnitudes. All other parameters\nwere computed as described in \u00a75.2.1.\nFigure 11 compares the observed age distribution derived from the HR diagram with the results from the\nMonte Carlo simulation. As expected, the peak of the\nsimulated distribution decreases and more power is seen\nin the wings as a larger age spread is injected into the\npopulation. We have run a \u03c72 test between central peaks\nof the data and the simulated model distributions between log(age)=6 and log(age)=7.4. We find that the\ncomputed \u03c72 probability remains high, between 50% and\n60%, for simulations with an age spread of \u2264 \u00b12 Myr,\nand then falls off rapidly with probabilities of <5% beyond \u00b13 Myr. Thus, we conclude that the observed low\nmass population of USco formed in <6 Myr, and most\nlikely <4 Myr; this finding is much less than the >10\nMyr age spread implied by literal interpretation of the\nHR diagram.\n5.3. The Low-Mass IMF\nIn this section we use model tracks to derive the first\nspectroscopic mass function for stars and brown dwarfs\nin USco less massive than \u223c0.1 M\u2299 . The study by\nPreibisch et al. (2002) derived an IMF for the stellar\npopulation in the association by combining the 166 spectroscopically confirmed low mass members (M \u223c0.8\u20130.1\nM\u2299 ) discovered via their 2dF survey with the 120 known\nHipparcos members (constituting a complete sample of\nmembers more massive than \u223c1 M\u2299 ) and 84 X-ray selected members (M \u223c0.8\u20132 M\u2299 ; Preibisch & Zinnecker\n1999). The resultant mass function yielded a 3-segment\npower law function that was consistent with recent field\nstar and other cluster IMF determinations above \u223c2 M\u2299 ,\nbut with a 2\u03c3 excess of stars above numbers seen in the\nfield at lower masses.\nThe only previous survey that has attempted to derive an IMF for USco's substellar members is the photometric study by Lodieu et al. (2007). These authors observed \u223c6.5 deg2 of USco at ZY JHK-bands as part of\n\n\f8\n\nSlesnick et al.\n\nthe UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) Galactic Cluster Survey. From these data, the authors used\nthe J-band luminosity function to derive a photometric\nIMF in USco from 0.3\u20130.007 M\u2299 . They derived a\nmass function that was significantly flatter (dN/dM \u221d\nM \u22120.3\u00b10.1 ) than the IMF derived by Preibisch et al.\n(2002) for similar mass ranges (dN/dM \u221d M \u22120.9\u00b10.2 for\n0.1\u2264 M /M\u2299 <0.6). However, as noted in Slesnick et al.\n(2004), photometrically derived IMFs suffer from degeneracies between mass, age, distance, extinction, and photometric excess present in the CMDs from which they are\nderived, and they cannot directly (only statistically) correct for field star contamination.\nAs was discussed in \u00a75.2, deriving quantities from spectroscopic data placed onto an HR diagram has its own set\nof uncertainties. We have already shown that known uncertainties in observable magnitudes and spectral types\ncan produce an apparent age spread of >10 Myr, and\ntherefore must also determine if uncertainties in the data\ncan produce a false spread in the observed mass distribution. To address this issue, we derived a theoretical\nIMF for a coeval population of stars at 5 Myr. We assumed a spectral type distribution consistent with that\nfor our observed population, and assigned each star the\nmass that it would have at that spectral type if it were 5\nMyr-old. Examination of the difference between the two\nmass distributions using a KS test reveals that the mass\ndistributions derived from the data and the theoretical 5\nMyr-old population are statistically consistent with each\nother (probability=12%). Because the mass tracks are\nclose to vertical for low mass stars (see Figure 8), the\ndominant source of uncertainty in derived masses will\ncome from uncertainties in temperature, arising from uncertainties in spectral type (\u00b10.5 subtypes). Presuming\nwe are equally likely to misclassify a star 0.5 subtypes too\nearly as we are to misclassify it 0.5 substypes too late, the\nmass distribution will not change significantly. Thus, we\nconclude that the mass distribution derived from the HR\ndiagram is robust to observable uncertainties. We note,\nhowever, that the mass distribution is strongly affected\nby systematics in the theoretical models, and results will\nvary dependent upon which set of mass tracks are used.\nIn Figure 12, we show the IMF derived using the DM97\nmodels for our spectroscopic survey of low mass stars\nand brown dwarfs, covering the mass range M \u223c0.2\u20130.02\nM\u2299 . Because we have observed spectroscopically only\n\u223c15% of the photometric PMS star candidates, before\nconstructing a mass function, it is necessary to determine\nthat the spectroscopic sample presented here is representative of the USco low mass population as a whole. We\nuse a method similar to that employed by Slesnick et al.\n(2004) and determine the relative completeness of our\nsample by computing the number of stars observed spectroscopically compared to the number of photometric\ncandidates present in uniformly-spaced bins perpendicular to the line of selection at the 1% data contour (see\nFigure 1). As can be seen, the number of observed stars\nfalls off considerably for stars with magnitudes r &19.5\nwhich could be observed only under the best seeing conditions. The spectroscopic survey completeness peaks at\n\u223c20%. We correct the IMF to uniform completeness at\nthis level by determining the mass distribution of stars\nwithin each magnitude bin. We then add stars to the\nrelevant mass bins based on the fractional completeness\n\nof the magnitude bins they came from, relative to the\nmaximum 20% completeness level.\nIn order to extend our sample to higher masses, we\ncombined masses derived for our sample with those for\nstars from the survey by Preibisch et al. (2002). We\nchose to use the Preibisch et al. (2002) sample because\n(1) it constitutes the largest sample of spectroscopically\nconfirmed low mass stellar members, and (2) candidates\nwere selected from an I, R \u2212 I CMD in a manner similar\nto the methods employed to select our sample thus providing a complementary dataset. We specifically chose\nnot to include the higher mass X-ray selected sources\n(Preibisch & Zinnecker 1999) due to the large difference\nin selection techniques. To provide the most analogous samples possible, we re-derived masses for the 160\nstars in the Preibisch et al. (2002) survey with M spectral types by first converting published spectral types\nand 2MASS magnitudes to temperature and luminosity\nusing the techniques described in \u00a75.1, and then using\nthe DM97 tracks and the same interpolation program\nused to generate masses for the sample of stars presented here. In combining samples from multiple sources,\none must be careful to account for relative completeness.\nPreibisch et al. (2002) estimate spectroscopic completeness levels of 87% for stars with 0.2 < M/M\u2299 <0.8 and\n67% for stars with mass <0.2 M\u2299 , whereas, our corrected\nsurvey is only 20% complete across all sampled mass bins.\nThe number of stars in the Preibisch et al. (2002) survey\nwere thus multiplied by either (20% complete/87% complete) for stars with 0.2 < M/M\u2299 <0.8, or (20% complete/67% complete) for stars with M <0.2 M\u2299 . The two\nsurveys also cover very different areas. Preibisch et al.\n(2002) looked at 9 deg2 whereas the Quest-2 survey\nlooked at \u223c150 deg2 . However, as discussed in Paper I,\nSCH06, and Slesnick (2007), the Quest-2 survey coverage within this area is not complete due to several failed\nCCDs, gaps between the CCDs, and incomplete r\u2212i color\ncoverage. To account for differences in area, we scaled\nthe IMF derived from the Preibisch et al. (2002) data to\nmatch, on average, the level of the IMF derived from\nstars in our survey in the -0.6>log(M/M\u2299)>-1.0 mass\nbins. Due to the nature of magnitude limited surveys,\nthe lowest mass bin (or bins, depending on bin-width) of\nany IMF is usually incomplete relative to the rest of the\nderived distribution; thus, for the IMF in the combined\nsamples, we use the values derived from the Quest-2 data\nto populate the -1.0>log(M/M\u2299)>-1.4 bins of the IMF.\nFigure 14 shows IMFs for the low mass stellar and\nsubstellar population of the USco association. In total,\nthe combined IMF contains \u223c377 stars with masses as\nhigh as \u223c0.6 M\u2299 and as low as <0.02 M\u2299 . The derived\nmass function rises with a slope of dN/dM \u221d M \u22121.13 ,\npeaks at \u223c0.13 M\u2299 , remains high with a secondary peak\nat M\u223c0.05 M\u2299 , and then gradually falls off through\nthe substellar regime. Thus, we find the spectroscopic\nIMF for USco's low mass population to be very different from the photometric IMF derived by Lodieu et al.\n(2007) which had a flatter slope dN/dM \u221d M \u22120.3 from\n0.3< M/M\u2299 <0.01, and peaked at M \u223c0.01 M\u2299 . The\ntotal mass inferred from the spectroscopic IMF over the\nmass range 0.6\u20130.02 M\u2299 is \u223c48 M\u2299 . If we correct this\nnumber to account for the fact that the IMF shown here\nis only 20% complete over \u223c40% of the entire spatial extent of the Hipparcos stars, the total mass inferred for\n\n\fAge/Mass Distribution in USco\nassociation members less massive than \u223c0.6 M\u2299 is \u223c600\nM\u2299 .\n5.4. Comparisons of the Low Mass IMF between\n\nStar-Forming Regions\nDiagnostic studies of stellar populations in different\nlocations and at varying stages of evolution are needed\nto explore the possibility of a universal mass function\nfor low mass objects. While one might expect that the\nIMF should vary with star formation environment, we\ndo not yet have enough evidence to determine if such a\nvariation exists. Aside from the work presented here, numerous studies have been carried out to characterize the\nlow mass stellar and substellar mass functions of other\nyoung clusters and associations in a variety of environments. Because of the intrinsic faintness of low mass objects, most surveys are photometric. Authors then use a\ncombination of theoretical models and statistical analysis\nto transform a group's color-magnitude diagram or luminosity function into a photometric IMF which may not\naccurately represent the underlying population. Spectroscopic surveys provide a more accurate assessment of the\nstellar membership and thus, of the underlying cluster\npopulation.\nThe substellar populations of several other young starforming regions have been studied spectroscopically using techniques similar to those presented here, and we\ndiscuss results for USco in comparison to three other\nregions. Luhman et al. (2003b) studied the rich cluster IC 348 in Perseus. There have been several studies of the Taurus region, namely those by Luhman\n(2000), Brice\u00f1o et al. (2002), Luhman et al. (2003a), and\nLuhman (2004), which together constitute a complete\nsample within a selected region. Slesnick et al. (2004)\nused near-infrared imaging and spectroscopic observations to constrain the low mass IMF in the \u223c1 Myrold Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). The data for IC\n348 (Luhman et al. 2003b) and Taurus (Luhman 2000,\nBrice\u00f1o et al. 2002, Luhman et al. 2003a, and Luhman\n2004) are published as complete across all mass ranges\nwithin the areas surveyed. Slesnick et al. (2004) employed similar techniques to those used here to correct\nthe derived IMF to a uniform 40% completeness across\nall magnitude ranges. IC 348, Taurus, and the ONC are\nall young (age .3 Myr), and, similar to USco, have not\nyet had time to lose members through dynamical ejection. Therefore, if the low mass IMF is universal, similar\nmass distributions should be observed in all four regions.\nOur goal in this section is to assess the physical differences between stars formed in different star-forming\nenvironments. As described in \u00a75.1, effective temperatures shown in Figure 8 are derived directly from observed spectral types using a theoretical or (in our case)\nempirical temperature scale. Observational evidence\nsuggests that late-type young stars will have a similar\nmass across a large range of ages. For example, similar masses of M \u223c0.03\u20130.09 M\u2299 have been measured for\nM6\u2013M7 binary or triple compenents in both the ONC\n(\u223c1 Myr; Stassun et al. (2006)) and AB Dor (\u223c75 Myr;\nClose et al. (2007)). Thus, spectral type distributions\nshould provide a reasonable approximation to mass distributions for young low mass stars. We therefore begin this exercise by first comparing spectral type distributions found in different star forming regions, and\n\n9\n\nthereby avoid introducing uncertainties that inherently\narise when deriving stellar masses.\nSpectral type distributions are shown in Figure 15. All\nfour distributions are complete in a relative sense across\nspectral type bins for M-type stars. Distributions for\nmembers of the ONC and members of USco discovered\nwith Quest-2 were corrected to a uniform completeness\nlevel in a manner similar to that described in \u00a75.3. We\nhave included in the IC 348 and Taurus spectral-type\ndistributions all M-type stars present in the IMF of the\nrespective discovery paper. As can be seen, the distribution for USco is visually dissimilar to the other regions,\neven considering the small sample sizes and large error\nbars. This difference could be due to real variation in the\nIMF, but could also be influenced by the difference in\nage of a few million years (\u223c5 Myr vs. .3 Myr) between\nUSco and the other regions. We performed \u03c72 tests between all four distributions to determine the probabilities\nthat the distributions could have be drawn from the same\npopulation. The tests yielded a very small probability\n(\u223c10\u221222 ) that the USco and ONC distributions could be\ndrawn from the same population, and marginally-small\nprobabilities at the 5\u201310% levels of USco arising from\nthe same population as either Taurus or IC 348. However, we caution against taking results from the \u03c72 test\nat face value. The histograms for USco and the ONC\nhave been scaled to account for incompleteness in magnitude and spatial area during the observations, and correctly and rigorously accounting for these scaling factors\nin the \u03c72 test is a non-trivial and not straight-forward\nexercise. The Taurus and IC348 populations, however,\nhave not been scaled, and have an almost 100% chance\nof being drawn from the same population. While this result argues for a common spectral-type distribution between these two regions amoung the lowest mass stars\nand brown dwarfs, substantial variation was found by\nLuhman et al. (2003b) for hotter, K-type stars.\nWe now compare directly mass distributions for the\nfour selected star forming regions. As discussed above\nand in \u00a75.1, the mass of a star is inferred from placement\non an HR diagram using a set of theoretical mass tracks,\nand the exact method by which the mass is derived can\nvary significantly from study to study. Thus, direct comparison of the published mass data itself requires great\ncaution given that different mass tracks, temperature\nscales, and interpolation methods were used for different\nstudies. Quantitative assessment of the differences between theoretical PMS star models is beyond the scope\nof this work, as is analysis of differences between the numerous temperature scales employed by various authors\nwho study young low mass stars. We have used published spectral types and 2MASS J, H, KS magnitudes\nto derive effective temperatures, luminosities, and hence\nmasses in a manner consistent with that used in our work\nin the ONC and USco. We reiterate that masses for all\nstars presented in this section were derived in a consistent manner; however, variations in the theoretical or\nempirical scales/tracks used could shift interpretation of\nthe data.\nIMFs derived from the DM97 tracks are shown in Figures 16. We find that the ONC, IC 348, and Taurus\nIMFs exhibit a fall-off of stars beyond \u223c0.1 M\u2299 . The\nmass distribution for USco, however, does not begin to\nturnover until \u223c0.05 M\u2299 . Thus, similar to the spectral\n\n\f10\n\nSlesnick et al.\n\ntype distribution, the IMF derived for USco shows an\nover-abundance of late-type, low mass stars, and suggests\nthat the difference seen in USco's spectral type distribution did arise from a differnce in it's IMF, rather than\nfrom slight differences in age between USco and the other\nregions. Our work extends the claim by Preibisch et al.\n(2002) that USco may contain anomolously high numbers (compared to the field) of low mass stars to lower\nmasses, and is suggestive that USco also contains relatively higher numbers of very low mass stars and brown\ndwarfs compared to other nearby star-forming regions.\nUSco differs from IC 348, Taurus and the ONC in that\nit contains \u223c50 very massive, O- and B-type stars, almost three times the number found in the ONC (none\nare found in either Taurus or IC 348). Thus, the conclusion that USco may contain relatively more very low mass\nstars than other young regions may be related to its large\nnumber of high mass stars. For example, Adams et al.\n(2006) have shown through numerical simulation that\ndisks around lower mass stars are more susceptible to\ndestruction (further out than \u223c10 AU) from dynamical\ninteractions with surrounding stars of higher mass. It is\npossible that in a similar manner, low mass cores moving through a giant molecular cloud are more susceptible\nto stripping of their accretion envelope in the presence\nof higher mass cores. Our results suggest that, within a\nstar forming region, either the presence of large numbers\nof very massive stars, or the environmental conditions\nthat lead to numerous massive star formation, may play\na large role in determining the low mass IMF. We note\nthat this conclusion has been drawn from results for only\nfour different environments. Many more regions must be\nstudied before a definitive explanation of the low mass\nIMF can be derived.\n6. SUMMARY\n\nWe have completed a large-area g, r, i photometric survey of \u223c150 deg2 in and near the Upper Scorpius region\n\nof recent star formation. From these data, combined with\n2MASS near-infrared magnitudes, we selected candidate\nnew PMS association members. We present here spectral\nobservations for a total of 243 candidates observed at either Palomar or CTIO, from which we determined 145\n(\u223c60%) to be bona fide new Upper Scorpius members.\nWe measured H\u03b1 emission for all new members and determine 15 of the 145 low mass stars and brown dwarfs in\nthe 5 Myr USco association are still accreting. Based on\ncomparison of the spatial distributions of low and high\nmass association members, we find no evidence for spatial segregation in USco within the northern portion of\nthe association.\nWe used photometry and spectral types to derive effective temperatures and luminosities, and placed newly\nidentified association members onto an HR diagram.\nThese data were combined with pre-main sequence evolutionary models to derive a mass and age for each star.\nUsing Monte Carlo simulations we showed that, taking\ninto account known observational errors, the observed\nage dispersion for the low mass population in USco is\nconsistent with all stars forming in a single burst \u223c5\nMyr ago, and place an upper limit of \u00b13 Myr (i.e., 60%)\non the age spread if the star formation rate has been\nconstant in time. We also derived the first spectroscopic\nmass function for USco that extends into the substellar regime and compared these results to those for three\nother young clusters and associations.\n\n7.

Contours represent\nthe density of sources in the diagram, with contour levels at 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10\u201390% of the peak value. Objects red-ward of a linear\napproximation of the 1% contour are shown as discrete points. Objects for which we have spectral data are shown as large symbols.\nPhotometry for four of the targets has changed significantly since the first spectroscopic observations were taken (see SCH06) such that\nthey would no longer be considered candidates.\n\nFig. 2.- Left panel shows temperature-sensitive TiO-7140 vs. TiO-8465 indices; right panel shows TiO-8465 index vs. gravity sensitive\nNa-8190 index. In both panels, blue X's represent measured indices for a sample of old stars comprised of field dwarfs and members of the\nHyades (\u223c650 Myr), Pleiades (\u223c115 Myr) and AB Dor (\u223c75\u2013150 Myr) associations. Green X's show measured indices for intermediate-age\nspectral standards from Beta Pic (\u223c11 Myr), TW Hya (\u223c8 Myr), and Upper Sco (\u223c5 Myr). Red X's show measured indices for young\nTaurus members (\u223c1\u20132 Myr). Magenta X's in the right panel represent measured indices for giant standard stars. In both panels, black\ncircles are measured indices for USco PMS candidates observed at Palomar. The effects of extinction and veiling are shown as vectors (see\nPaper I and SCH06).\n\n\fAge/Mass Distribution in USco\n\n13\n\nFig. 3.- Histograms of r- and J-band magnitudes for targets of the Hydra spectral observations. The top histograms show data for\nstars classified as spectral type late-K to M; the bottom histograms show data classified as spectral type late F to early-K. Shown in both\npanels is the expected range of magnitudes for 5 Myr-old stars of those spectral types at the distance of USco.\n\nFig. 4.- Measured H\u03b1 equivalent widths for all 145 low mass USco members presented here, shown as a function of spectral type. Dashed\nline represents the empirical accretor/nonaccretor upper limit derived by Barrado y Navascu\u00e9s & Mart\u0131\u0301n (2003). Solid line represents the\nmedian W (H\u03b1) for each spectral type. The spectral-type bins earlier than M4 and later than M7 do not have enough measurements to\nderive a statistically representative value for median H\u03b1 emission and we do not consider any star outside the M4\u2013M7 spectral type range\nto be in our sample of H\u03b1 excess sources. Boxed objects have H\u03b1 emission in excess of 3\u03c3 above the median value for their spectral type,\nand are considered by us to be actively accreting.\n\n\f14\n\nSlesnick et al.\n\nFig. 5.- Spectra of the 15 stars determined to be accreting (as defined in \u00a73), shown in order of decreasing spectral type.\n\n-15\n\n-20\n\n-25\n\n-30\n\n255\n\n250\n\n245\n\n240\n\n235\n\nRA J2000 [deg]\n\nFig. 6.- Spatial distribution of the 120 known Hipparcos members of USco (open triangle) shown with stars observed spectroscopically\nby us that were determined to be new members (open circles). The Quest-2 survey area is boxed in black. The approximate location and\nsize of the 2dF fields observed by Preibisch et al. (2002) are shown as large circles.\n\n\fAge/Mass Distribution in USco\n\n15\n\nFig. 7.- Top panel shows the percentage of the low mass stars (M .0.6 M\u2299 ) discovered in this work (corrected to a uniform 25% of\ncandidates observed across all values) that lie at a given right ascension (dashed line) together with same information for the 56 high mass\nHipparcos stars (M &1 M\u2299 ) found in the Quest-2 survey area (solid line). Bottom panel illustrates the same information as a function of\ndeclination. In both top and bottom panels, the coordinates of the high mass star bins have been shifted by 0.25\u25e6 for ease of comparison\nbetween the high and low mass samples. Errorbars assume Poisson statistics.\n\nFig. 8.- HR diagram for new PMS objects found in the USco region, shown with model tracks and isochrones of D'Antona & Mazzitelli\n(1997). The sample is consistent with an age of \u223c5 Myr and contains masses spanning the brown dwarf to stellar regimes. The arrow\nplus dotted symbol indicates where the star SCH16224384-19510575 would sit in the HR diagram as a single star if it is an unresolved,\nequal-mass binary (see \u00a74.2 in Paper I).\n\n\f16\n\nSlesnick et al.\n\nFig. 9.- Top panel shows spectra of two stars with spectral type M5 found in the USco survey. The top spectrum is of the 'youngest'\n(based on analysis of the HR diagram) M5 star observed spectroscopically at Palomar, \u223c2.6 Myr-old; the bottom spectrum is of the 'oldest'\n(based on analysis of the HR diagram) M5 star observed at Palomar, \u223c14.4 Myr. However, these stars have near-identical spectra, and,\nbased on analysis of the strength of the surface gravity sensitive Na I line (8190 \u00c5), appear to be the same age. In the lower panel we show\nspectra of known members of Taurus and USco, for comparison. The two stars have measured Na-8190 indices that are different by \u223c9%,\nand can be easily distinguished from each other visually.\n\n\fAge/Mass Distribution in USco\n\n17\n\nFig. 10.- Red shaded histogram shows the age distribution derived from the Monte Carlo simulation, overplotted with a histogram of\nages for the data (black hatched histogram). Both histograms have been normalized to unity at the peak for comparison, and stars having\nlog(Tef f ) <3.4 (beyond which interpolation of the isochrones becomes unreliable) have been excluded from the data and the model results.\nThe widths of the distributions are remarkably similar, given the simplistic nature of the Monte Carlo simulation.\n\nFig. 11.- Red dashed line shows the age distribution derived from spectral data, plotted as percentage of the total stars that are at\na certain age. Colored solid lines show the same information for results form the coeval model (black), together with results from model\nage distributions of 5\u00b11.5 Myr (green), 5\u00b13 Myr (magenta), and 5\u00b14.5 Myr (blue). As expected, the peak of the simulated distribution\ndecreases and more power is seen in the wings as a larger age spread is injected into the population.\n\n\f18\n\nSlesnick et al.\n\nFig. 12.- Mass function for all spectroscopically confirmed members presented in this work. Thick-lined hatched histogram indicates\nall stars in our spectroscopic sample; the dotted open histogram represents the same sample corrected for incomplete selection bins (\u00a75.3).\n\n\fAge/Mass Distribution in USco\n\n19\n\nFig. 13.- Histogram of optical CMD completeness as a function of r magnitude. Bin centers correspond to r magnitudes at the 1%\ncontour line in Figure 1. The top panel shows data for all photometric PMS candidates selected as in\u221a\u00a72.1, and the middle panel shows\ndata for all targets observed spectroscopically. The bottom panel shows the percent completeness with N errorbars. Completeness peaks\nat 20% near r=19.5 mag.\n\n\f20\n\nSlesnick et al.\n\nFig. 14.- IMF for the USco association from \u223c0.6\u20130.02 M\u2299 . The light and dark hatched histograms depict the IMFs derived from the\nQuest-2 survey and the Preibisch et al. (2002) survey, respectively. Both IMFs have been scaled to a uniform 20% completeness, and data\nfrom the Preibisch et al. (2002)\nsurvey have been scaled to match the data presented here in the -0.6>log(M/M\u2299 )>-1.0 mass bins.
