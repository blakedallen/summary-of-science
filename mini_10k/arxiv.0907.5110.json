We determine the fundamental stellar parameters of altogether 20 double-mode RR Lyrae (RRd) stars from the\nGalactic Field and the Large Magellanic Cloud, following our approach employed on the field RRd star BS Comae [1]. The\nstars were selected to cover wide ranges of periods and period ratios, implying diverse stellar parameters. From the possible\nobserved quantities we use only the periods and determine stellar parameter combinations that satisfy both current heliumburning evolutionary models and grids of linear non-adiabatic purely radiative pulsational models. Thus, the periods of an\nobject determine a sequence of solutions for its mass, luminosity, effective temperature and metallicity, parametrized by the\ntime elapsed from the zero age horizontal branch. The derived sets of solutions yield various important theoretical relations\nbetween the physical parameters of the stars which are, in the case of some parameter combinations, nearly independent of\nthe age. We get very tight simple linear relations between log P0 and log R, log \u03c1 , log g and the Wesenheit index W (B \u2212 V ).\nThis latter period-luminosity-color relation is in good agreement with the one derived on empirical basis [2] and calibrated by\nBaade-Wesselink results [3].\nKeywords: RRd stars, fundamental parameters\nPACS: 97.30.Kn, 97.10.Sj\n\nINTRODUCTION\nDouble-mode RR Lyrae (RRd) stars pulsate simultaneously and stably in the first two radial modes with a period ratio close to 0.75. Their two precisely observable\nperiods make them a particularly important subtype of\nRR Lyrae stars by supplying an additional constraint on\ntheir structure. Eventually, the double-mode nature offers the possibility of determining the fundamental parameters of these stars from radial pulsation models. The\nsolid theory of linear radial pulsation has long been used\nfor this purpose by fitting models simultaneously to the\nperiods of both pulsation modes. By measuring or giving\nan estimate on the chemical composition and effective\ntemperature of the star we can derive its mass and luminosity. The consistency of these values can be confirmed\nby independently obtained distances [see, e.g., 4].\nNonlinear hydrodynamical modeling of double-mode\npulsation has also became possible in the past decade [5,\n6]. Sustained double-mode pulsation can be reproduced\nin a consistent range of physical parameters, a star-bystar modeling, however, is still not available.\nFor a fully consistent RRd model it is important to\ntake horizontal branch (HB) stellar evolution also into\naccount. In a novel study of this endeavor, to involve evolutionary constraints in explaining the observed period\ndistribution of RRd stars of the Large Magellanic Cloud\n(LMC) by means of physical parameter ranges, [7] calculated pulsation model sequences along theoretical tracks\nof HB evolution to compare the theoretical period distribution with the observed one. In the present study we\n\nfollow a different approach by taking the observed periods as an input to our calculations and search for a set\nof physical parameters that satisfy the combined parameter space of pulsational and evolutionary models. Thus\nobtaining strongly constrained values for the fundamental parameters of a representative sample of RRd stars,\nwe can probe the full parameter ranges they populate, as\nwell as use them to deduce theoretical relations among\ntheir physical parameters.\n\nMETHOD AND DATA\nOur goal is to determine the fundamental parameters of\nan RRd star solely from its periods by restricting the parameter space of pulsation models by the constraints of\nevolutionary models. The basic assumption behind this\napproach is that there is a good level of consistency between the two kinds of models. We obtain the fundamental physical parameters of a star by the same procedure as\ndescribed in [1], and hereby we only briefly summarize\nthe essentials of the method.\nOn the one hand we calculate a grid of linear pulsation models fitting the observed pair of periods. These\nmodels give stellar mass and luminosity for specified effective temperature and metallicity values. On the other\nhand, isochrones of Helium-burning models also determine mass and luminosity as a function of effective temperature, metal content, and age. To obtain the set of parameters that satisfy both models we have to calculate the\nintersection of these two restricted parameter-subspaces\n\n\fMACHO - 6.6691.1003\n\n0.747\n\n7000\n6900\n-1.40\n\n0.746\n\n-1.50\n\n0.745\n\nP1 / P0\n\n[Fe/H]\n\nTeff\n\n7100\n\nM/M\u2299\n\n-1.60\n0.68\n0.67\n0.66\n\n0.744\n0.743\n\nlog L/L\u2299\n\n0.65\n1.72\n\n0.742\n\n1.70\n\n0.741\n\n1.68\n6.0\n\n6.2\n\n6.4\n\n6.6\n\n6.8\n\n7.0\n\n7.2\n\n7.4\n\n7.6\n\n7.8\n\nlog t\n\nFIGURE 1.

Age dependence of the various physical parameters\nare shown up to logt = 7.86 (\u2248 72.5 Myr).\n\n(formally vector-vector functions that we sample on a\ngrid). By fixing the periods to the observed ones, evolutionary models have one variable in surplus, the age,\nie. the time elapsed from the zero age horizontal branch\n(ZAHB), which will be a free parameter of the solution.\nWe used the canonical HB evolution models of [8]\nwith solar-scaled heavy element mixture. These models have a fine mass and time spacing, suitable for the\ndetailed investigation of the instability strip. We obtained isochrones by interpolating the tracks to a uniform\nmass and time base. We generated linear, non-adiabatic\n(LNA), fully radiative pulsation models. The pulsation\nmodel grid was calculated for the same chemical compositions as those of the evolutionary tracks, and with a fine\ntemperature step of 50 K. The deep and dense sampling\nof the stellar envelopes resulted in an accuracy of \u223c 10\u22125\nin the period fit. See [1] for further details on the model\nconstruction.\nAs a result of the method, for a pair of observed periods we obtain a 1-D solution sequence giving the effective temperature, metallicity, stellar mass, and luminosity\nas a function of the time parameter. Thus, each point of a\nsequence determine combinations of physical parameters\ncorresponding to different stages of evolutionary tracks\nof different masses and metallicities. We also calculate\nsynthetic colors from the parameter sequences using the\nstellar atmosphere models of [9]. Fig. 1 gives an example\nsolution for the various physical parameters. We note that\nin the absence of any additional reliable observational\nconstraint, the models themselves alone do not pose any\nlimit on the time parameter. However, we can still put\nrough boundaries on the solution sequences by keep-\n\n0.44 0.46 0.48 0.50 0.52 0.54 0.56 0.58\n\nP0\nFIGURE 2.

Thus, in most cases we\nstop scanning in age between logt = 7.85 and 7.9.\nFigure 2 shows the Petersen diagram of all known\nGalactic Field RRd stars and those found in the LMC\nby the MACHO project. The ranges of the P1 /P0 vs.\nP0 distribution populated by these stars encompass the\nvast majority of all known double-mode RR Lyrae stars\nin any stellar system. We selected a sub-sample of 20\nstars (3 from the Field: AQ Leo, BS Com, and CU Com,\nand 17 more from the LMC) to survey full ranges of\nphysical parameters, as implied by the periods and period\nratios. Sequences for fundamental physical parameters\nwere obtained for each of the stars in the way discussed\nabove. We present the analysis of the derived sets of\nsolutions in the following section.\n\nRESULTS\nBased on the Petersen diagram, the physical parameters\nobtained for the 20 objects investigated in this work are\nrepresentative for all known RRd stars (and their luminosities, presumably, for a dominant fraction of singlemode RR Lyrae stars). Therefore, we use them to measure the fundamental parameter ranges populated by\nthese objects and probe important theoretical relations\n\n\f1.78\n\n0.32\n0.30\n\n1.74\n\nB-V\n\nlog L / L\u2299\n\n1.76\n\n1.72\n-1.8\n\n1.70\n\n0.28\n0.26\n\n-1.5\n\n1.68\n\n0.24\n\n-1.3\n\n1.66\n7400\n\n7200\n\n7000\n\n6800\n\n6600\n\n6400\n\n6200\n\nTeff [K]\n\nFIGURE 3.

Helium-burning evolutionary model tracks\nof [8] are shown by thin gray lines for [Fe/H] values of \u22121.3,\n\u22121.5, and \u22121.8 (redward parts of tracks for masses lower than\n0.64, 0.66, and 0.70, respectively, are not plotted for more\nperspicuity).\n\ndefined by the solutions of our method.\nFigure 3 shows the distribution of the solutions on\nthe Herzschprung-Russell diagram (HRD) together with\nvarious evolutionary tracks for reference. The expected\ngeneral trend, that stars with lower metallicity are cooler\nand brighter, is clearly exhibited. The gradual topological\nchange of the sequences originates from the smoothly\nchanging sizes and shapes of the blueward loops in the\nconstituting tracks, mainly as a function of metallicity.\nAs it is also shown in Fig. 1, the temperature dependence\nof a solution increases considerably for higher values of\nage (i.e., after reaching the high temperature extrema \u2013\nthe 'blue noses' \u2013 of the constituting tracks). Therefore\nwe would need further specific information on each star\n(i.e., on their spectral energy distributions) to put more\nsignificant constraints on their temperatures. However,\naccording to the combined models, RRd stars populate\nan overall temperature range of at least 300 K, as it is\nclear from Fig. 3.\nFigure 4 shows the solutions on the B \u2212 V vs. V \u2212 I\ntwo-color diagram. Stars are concentrated into a very\nnarrow overall range of color index pairs. Here we note\nthat by a very precisely measured pair of color indices\none would be able to further constrain the time parameter, thus reducing the ranges of uncertainty in all other\nparameters, as it was successfully done in the case of\nBS Com [see 1].\nIn Fig. 5 we examine the luminosity and mass as\nfunctions of the metallicity. Values corresponding to the\nZAHB states show a tight and, apparently, somewhat\nnon-linear correlation with [Fe/H] in both cases.

Accordingly, for specified mass the models give a minimal luminosity, and, vice-verse, for a fixed luminosity, they put\na constraint on the maximum value of the mass. Since\nwe selected our stars to cover nearly the full RRd period\nranges of the LMC (and by this selection, that of almost\nall known RRd stars as well), the solutions inherently\nyield the full theoretical [Fe/H], mass, and MV ranges\nspanned by the constituting objects. Although the individual sequences suffer from an uncertainty of roughly\n0.1 \u2212 0.3 dex in metallicity (depending on the allowed\nrange of the time parameter), the upper limit for the overall [Fe/H] range turns out to be \u223c 0.9 dex with extrema\nof approximately \u22121.3 and \u22122.2. We note that, as implied by the Petersen diagram (ie., the short period end is\nmore populated in the case of the LMC), the majority of\nthe stars are in the upper part of this metallicity range.\nBy direct spectrophotometric measurements of 6 RRd\nstars in the LMC, [18] found a wider metallicity range\nof (\u22122.28, \u22121.09). Besides the individual errors of the\nfew measurements and the sensitivity of the \u2206S method\nto different calibrations, this moderate difference may result from the possible non-solar heavy element mixture\nof these stars (we recall that throughout this paper solarscaled mixtures of heavy elements are used).\nThe stellar masses corresponding to our metallicity\ndomain span in a large 0.17 M\u2299 range from 0.64 M\u2299\nto 0.81 M\u2299 . As for absolute magnitudes, the luminosity\ninterval permitted by the solutions on (see Fig. 5) can\nbe translated into an MV range of (0.46, 0.70) which, as\nwe will see later, is in a good agreement with BaadeWesselink results.\nWe also computed log g, log R, and log \u03c1 values for all\nsolution sequences. These parameters are highly degenerate, i.e., very insensitive to the time parameter. They\nalso show very tight, linear correlations with the fundamental period. Figure 6 shows these simple theoretical\nrelations provided by our results.

For notation see Fig. 3.\n\ntiny individual parameter ranges are allowed by the solutions. Thus, for the sake of simplicity, linear formulae\ngiven on the same figure were obtained by fitting to the\nzero age solutions only.\nOne of the tightest empirical relations for RR Lyrae\nstars is the period-luminosity-color (PLC) relation, or in\nother words the period \u2013 reddening-free Wesenheit-index\nrelation. We can directly compare it with the one derived\nfrom the synthetic MV and color index values of RRd\nstars calculated above. Figure 7 shows the theoretical\nPLC relation for B and V colors stretched by our RRd\nmodel results. In this representation of the solutions we\nnotice a vast insensitivity again to evolution effects. For\ncomparison we show the empirical relation derived from\na large number of RRab stars from Galactic globular\nclusters (GCs) by [2], together with the 3 \u03c3 range of the\ncalibration sample. The zero-point of this relation was set\nby the Baade-Wesselink (BW) results for Galactic Field\nRRab stars (also shown in Fig. 7) as given by [3]. The\nzero points of the two relations show a fine agreement.\nAlthough the RRd sample clearly defines a significantly\nsteeper slope, it does not exceed the 3 \u03c3 ranges of the GC\nsample. We note that the situation is very similar in the\ncase of the V and I colors.\nThe reason for the slope difference is not yet clear\nand may be caused by a combination of different effects.\nSince the PLC relation is governed by two parameters\n(i.e., metallicity and effective temperature) out of four of\nthe pulsation equation, it has an intrinsic scatter within\nwhich the subset of RRd stars could follow their own,\ntighter relation, determined by the specific stellar parameter subspace they populate.\nWe can also speculate on the following. In the derivation of the empirical PLC relations by [2], no direct\ncalibration (i.e., using independently measured absolute\nmagnitudes) was made. Instead, the relative dereddened\ndistance moduli of the constituting globular clusters were\n\nobtained as output parameters of the least-squares minimization procedure, together with the regression coefficients. Thus, a uniform slope was obtained for all stars,\nnicely fitting the subsamples of the individual clusters,\nand the zero-point differences were interpreted as the result of the relative distances. Later [19] found a somewhat steeper W (V, I) \u2212 log P0 relation for LMC RRab\nstars than that of [2], but the scatter was much higher.\nThe HB stars of a GC have generally little if any metallicity dispersion. Therefore, if an additional slight, intrinsic metallicity dependence of the Wesenheit index does\nrather manifest in zero point than in slope differences\nbetween subsamples of stars with constant metallicity,\nits effect could merge with that of the relative distances\nand remained hidden in the above case. Furthermore, if\nthis is so, then our RRd sample will yield a steeper relation because it scans a considerable, nearly 1 dex range in\n[Fe/H], which, in this case, is more correlated with log P0 .\nHowever, we would need very precise independent relative distance determinations for the calibrating clusters\nto give a more secure assessment of this problem.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe presented a method and its applications for stellar parameter determination of double-mode RR Lyrae stars.\nThe method combines theoretical model results of linear stellar pulsation and canonical HB stellar evolution.\nBased on the periods of an object, the joint constraints of\nthe models allow sequences of fundamental stellar parameters with age as a free parameter. Additional observables like color index or metallicity can be used to\nput further constraints on the solutions. By using a representative sample of objects to probe the observed period\nranges of the known RRd's with our method, we obtained\nthe theoretical ranges of physical parameters populated\n\n\flog g = -1.069 log P0 + 2.532\n\n0.78\n\n2.88\n\n2.84\n2.82\n\nlog \u03c1 = - 2.058 log P0 - 2.778\n\n-2.10\n\nlog \u03c1 [ CGS ]\n\n2.86\n\n-2.05\n\nlog R/R\u2299 = 0.989 log P0 + 1.018\n\n0.76\n\nlog R / R\u2299\n\nlog g [ CGS ]\n\n2.90\n\n0.74\n0.72\n0.70\n\n-2.15\n-2.20\n-2.25\n\n2.80\n0.68\n2.78\n\n-2.30\n-0.35\n\n-0.30\n\n-0.25\n\n-0.35\n\nlog P0\n\n-0.30\n\nlog P0\n\n-0.25\n\n-0.35\n\n-0.30\n\n-0.25\n\nlog P0\n\nW(B,V) = M(V) - 3.1 (B - V)\n\nFIGURE 6.
