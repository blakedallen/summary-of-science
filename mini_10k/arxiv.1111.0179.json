Here we calculate its thermodynamic and relaxation properties. Our calculations unveil the fundamental properties of QSL, forming strongly\ncorrelated Fermi system located at a fermion condensation quantum phase transition. These are\nin a good agreement with experimental data and allow us to detect the behavior of QSL as that\nobserved in heavy fermion metals. We predict that the thermal resistivity of QSL under the application of magnetic fields at fixed temperature demonstrates a very specific behavior. The key\nfeatures of our findings are the presence of spin-charge separation and QSL formed with itinerant\nheavy spinons in herbertsmithite.\n\nA search for the materials formed with fermionic spinons\ncarrying spin 1/2 and no charge is a challenge for a condensed matter physics [1]. A quantum spin liquid (QSL)\ncan be viewed as an exotic quantum state of matter\ncomposed of hypothetic particles like chargeless fermionic\nspinons with spin 1/2 and having a possibility to fluctuate\nas in ordinary fluid. The advances in theoretical studies\nof QSLs date back to Anderson's seminal paper [2] which\nignited hot discussions in the scientific community. Theoretical consensus is that the ground state of QSLs is not\nmagnetically ordered, including both gapped and gapless\nspin liquids [1]. However, the experimental investigation\nof QSLs is hindered by a lack of real solids where it can\noccur. In other words, no specific model substances with\nQSL has been found yet, although there are few possible\ncandidates. This means that the recognition of a perfect\nmaterial with clear QSL realization makes a major challenge in modern condensed matter physics.\nThe\nexperimental\nstudies\nof\nherbertsmithite\nZnCu3 (OH)6 Cl2 single crystal have found no evidences of\nlong range magnetic order or spin freezing indicating that\n(a) Email:\n\nvrshag@thd.pnpi.spb.ru\n\nZnCu3 (OH)6 Cl2 is the promising system to investigate\nQSL [3\u201312]. Presently herbertsmithite ZnCu3 (OH)6 Cl2\nhas been exposed as a S = 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet [3] on a perfect kagome lattice and new experimental\ninvestigations have revealed its unusual behavior [4\u20137], see\nRef. [8] for a recent review. In ZnCu3 (OH)6 Cl2 , the Cu2+\nions with S = 1/2 form the triangular kagome lattice,\nand are separated by nonmagnetic intermediate layers of\nZn and Cl atoms. The planes of the Cu2+ ions can be\nconsidered as two-dimensional (2D) layers with negligible\nmagnetic interactions along the third dimension.\nA frustration of simple kagome lattice leads to a dispersionless topologically protected branch of the spectrum\nwith zero excitation energy known as the flat band [13,14].\nIn this case the fermion condensation quantum phase transition (FCQPT) [15,16] can be considered as quantum critical point (QCP) of the ZnCu3 (OH)6 Cl2 QSL composed\nof chargeless fermions with S = 1/2 occupying the corresponding Fermi sphere with the Fermi momentum pF .\nAs we are dealing with the 3D compound ZnCu3 (OH)6 Cl2\nrather than with an ideal 2D kagome lattice, we have to\nbear in mind that the real magnetic interactions in the\nsubstance can shift the QSL from the exact FCQPT point,\n\np-1\n\n\fV.R. Shaginyan et al.\npositioning it in front of or behind the QCP. Therefore,\nthe actual location has to be established by analyzing the\nexperimental data only. It is believed that the S = 1/2\nmodel on the kagome lattice can be viewed as a gapless\nspin liquid [4\u201312], while recent accurate calculations point\nto a fully gapped one, see [17] and Refs. therein. Thus,\nit is of crucial importance to test what kind of QSL is\nformed in herbertsmithite and determines its low temperature thermodynamic and relaxation properties.\n\nform. unit)\n\n0,016\n\nA\nB=0 T\nB=0.5 T\n\n6\n\n2\n\n-1\n\nB=3 T\n\n10\n\nB\n\n-1\n\nB=5 T\nB=7 T\n\nV\n\nB=10 T\n\nC\n\nB=14 T\n\n3\n\n3\n\n(JK mol\n\n(cm /mol Cu )\n\nB=1 T\n\nZnCu (OH) Cl\n\nTheory\n\nficients. At the same time, at elevated temperatures a\nnon-Fermi liquid (NFL) regime emerges separated by a\ntransition (or crossover) region. In other words, the candidate substance should exhibit the LFL, NFL and the\ntransition regimes similar to the case of heavy fermion\n(HF) metals and 2D 3 He [15, 16, 18, 19]. This means that\nQSL plays the role of HF liquid placed into the insulating\ncompound. Spin is carried by an electron which becomes\nlocalized, while the spin is itinerant. Such a behavior resembles the spin-charge separation observed recently in 1D\nsystem of interacting non-localized electrons [20]. In our\ncase the charges is completely localized while the spins are\nitinerant dwelling on the topologically protected branch.\nAs a result, we face a breathtaking picture: New particles govern the systems properties at low temperatures\nand these are different from the particles presented in the\nHamiltonian describing the system.\n\n1\n\n3\n\nZnCu (OH) Cl\n3\n\nmax\n\n0\n\nT [K]\n\n6\n\nC =a T +a T\nV\n\n1\n\n1/3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n20\n\n1\n\n40\n\nT [K]\n\n10\n\nTemperature, arb.units\n\nT\n0,000\n\n100\n\nB=4 T\nB=6 T\n\nC\n\nB=8 T\nB=10 T\n\n-1\n\nC/T [JK mol ]\n\n0.3\n\nB=12 T\nB=14 T\nmax\n\nB=16 T\n\n-2\n\n(C/T)\n\nB=18 T\n\n0.2\n\nNormalized mass\n\nmax\n\nTransition region\n1\n\nNFL\nT\nLFL\n\n0.1\n\n-2/3\nN\n\nNFL\n1\n\n10\n\nNormalized temperature\n\nNFL\n\nLFL\nNFL\n\nQCP\n\nZnCu\n(OH)\nCl\nZnCu\n(OH)\nCl\nZnCu\n(OH)\nCl\nZnCu (OH)\nCl\nZnCu\n3\n6\n2\nZnCu\n(OH)\nCl\n3 (OH)\n6 Cl\n2\n3\n6\n2\n3\n6\n2\n3\n\n6\n\n2\n\n3\n\n6\n\n2\n\nControl parameter, magnetic field B\n0.1\n\nT\n\nYbRh Si\n2\n\n2\n\nmax\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nT [K]\n\nFig. 1: Panel A: T -dependence of the magnetic susceptibility\n\u03c7 at different magnetic fields B [6] shown in the legend.

At very\nlow temperatures and with magnetic field B applied, we\nexpect that the possible QSL substances reveal a Landau\nFermi-liquid (LFL) behavior of their physical characteristics, like the magnetic specific heat and susceptibility,\nspin-lattice relaxation rate and the heat transport coef-\n\nFig. 2: Schematic phase diagram of ZnCu3 (OH)6 Cl2 . The\nsquare at the origin shown by the arrow represents QCP near\nwhich QSP is located. Vertical and horizontal arrows show\nLFL-NFL and NFL-LFL transitions at fixed B and T respectively. At fixed T the increase of B drives the system along the\nhorizontal arrow from NFL regime to LFL one. On the contrary, at fixed B and raising temperatures the system transits\nalong the vertical arrow from LFL regime to NFL one. The inset demonstrates the behavior of the normalized effective mass\n\u2217\nMN\nversus normalized temperature TN as given by eq. (5). It\nis seen that temperatures TN \u223c 1 signify a transition region between the LFL regime with almost constant effective mass and\nNFL one, given by T \u22122/3 dependence. It is seen from eq. (5)\nthat the width of the transition region Tw \u221d T \u221d B. The tran\u2217\nsition region, where MN\nreaches its maximum at T /Tmax = 1,\nis shown by the arrows and hatched area both in the main\npanel and in the inset.\n\nWe begin with the analysis of the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7(T ) of ZnCu3 (OH)6 Cl2 shown in the panel A of fig. 1.\nIt displays an unusual behavior [6]: at B \u2265 3 T, \u03c7(T ) has\na maximum \u03c7max (T ) at some temperature Tmax (B). The\nmaximum \u03c7max (T ) decreases as magnetic field B grows,\n\np-2\n\n\fIdentification of Spin Liquid\nwhile Tmax (B) shifts to higher T reaching 15 K at B = 14\nT. It is seen from the panel A of fig. 1 that \u03c7(T ) \u221d T \u2212\u03b1\nwith \u03b1 = 2/3. The calculated exponent is in good agreement with the experimental value \u03b1 = 2/3 \u2243 0.66 [6]. The\nobserved behavior of \u03c7 strongly resembles that in HF metals and associated with their proximity to FCQPT [15,16].\nThe specific heat C, arising from the Cu spin system, at\nthe lowest explored temperatures, 106 < T < 400 mK,\nfollows a linear temperature dependence, C \u221d T . As it is\nseen from fig. 1, panel B, for temperatures of a few Kelvin\nand higher, the specific heat becomes C(T ) \u221d T 3 and is\ndominated by the lattice contribution. At low temperatures T \u2264 1 K, the strong magnetic field dependence of the\nspecific heat C suggests that it is predominately formed by\nthe specific heat Cmag of QSL, Cmag = C \u2212a1 T 3 , since the\nlattice contribution is independent of B [4\u20136]. The above\nbehavior of \u03c7 (fig. 1, panel A) is a visible parallel to that\nof the HF metal YbRh2 Si2 observed in measurements of\nC/T and displayed in the panel C. This coincidence becomes evident if we recollect that for HF liquid \u03c7 \u221d C/T\n[15]. It is seen from the panel C that the electronic specific\nheat of YbRh2 Si2 [21] is also strongly dependent on the\napplied magnetic field and we will see below that both the\nspecific heat Cmag and that of YbRh2 Si2 exhibit the same\nbehavior.\n\n1.25\n(C/T)\n\nN\n\nZnCu (OH) Cl\n\nNORMALIZED\n\nC/T &\n\n3\n\n1.00\n\n0.75\n\n6\n\nN\n\nYbRh Si\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nB=3 T\n\nB=4 T\n\nB=5 T\n\nB=6 T\n\nB=7 T\n\nB=8 T\n\nB=10 T\n\nB=10 T\n\nB=14 T\n\nB=12 T\n\nB=16 T\n\nTheory\n\n0\n\n4\n\nT\n\n8\n\n\u00d7\n\n(1)\n\nHere we rewrite the quasiparticle distribution function as\nn\u03c3 (p, T, B) \u2261 n\u03c3 (p, T = 0, B = 0) + \u03b4n\u03c3 (p, T, B). The\nLandau amplitude F is completely defined by the fact that\nthe system has to be at QCP of FCQPT [15, 23\u201325], see\n[25] for details of solving eq. (1). The sole role of Landau amplitude is to bring the system to FCQPT point,\nwhere Fermi surface alters its topology so that the effective mass acquires temperature and field dependencies. At\nthis point, the term 1/M \u2217 vanishes, eq. (1) becomes homogeneous and can be solved analytically [15, 23]. At B = 0,\nthe effective mass, being strongly T - dependent, demonstrates the NFL behavior given by eq. (1)\n(2)\n\nAt finite T , under the application of magnetic field B the\ntwo Fermi spheres due to the Zeeman splitting are displaced by opposite amounts, the final chemical potential\n\u03bc remaining the same within corrections of order B 2 .

This model permits to avoid complications associated with the crystalline anisotropy of solids. In our\ncase, similar to the above HF liquid, QSL is composed of\nchargeless fermions (spinons) with S = 1/2 occupying the\ncorresponding two Fermi spheres with the Fermi momentum pF . The ground state energy E(n) is given by the\nLandau functional depending on the quasiparticle distribution function n\u03c3 (p), where p is the momentum and \u03c3 is\nthe spin index. The effective mass M \u2217 is governed by the\nLandau equation [15, 22]\nZ\n1\n1 X pF p1\n1\n= \u2217+ 2\nM \u2217 (T, B)\nM\npF \u03c3\npF\n\nM \u2217 (B) \u2243 aB B \u22122/3 .\n\n12\n\n(3)\n\nN\n\nFig. 3: The experimental data on measurements of \u03c7N [6],\n\u2217\n\u2217\n(C/T )N = MN\n[21] and our calculations of MN\nat fixed high\nmagnetic field (high means that it polarizes completely the\nquasiparticles spins) are shown by points of different shape\nand solid curve respectively. It is clearly seen that the data\ncollected on both ZnCu3 (OH)6 Cl2 and YbRh2 Si2 merge into\nthe same curve, obeying the scaling behavior. In accordance\nwith the phase diagram displayed in the panel A, at growing\ntemperatures (y \u2243 1) the LFL regime first converts into the\ntransition one and then disrupts into the NFL regime. This\ndemonstrates that the spin liquid of herbertsmithite is close\nto QCP and behaves like HF liquid of YbRh2 Si2 in strong\nmagnetic fields [25].\n\nIt is seen from eqs. (2) and (3) that effective mass diverges\nat FCQPT. At finite B and T near FCQPT, the solutions\nof eq. (1) M \u2217 (B, T ) can be well approximated by a simple\nuniversal interpolating function. This interpolation occurs\nbetween the LFL regime, given by eq. (3) and NFL regime\ngiven by eq. (2) [15,23]. In the case of strongly correlated\nFermi systems like HF metals and 2D 3 He the thermodynamic and relaxation properties are defined\nby the efp\nfective mass M \u2217 , namely \u03c7 \u221d (C/T ) \u221d 1/T1 T \u221d M \u2217 ,\nwhere 1/T1 T \u221d \u03c72 is the spin-lattice relaxation rate [15].\nTo study the universal scaling behavior of strongly correlated Fermi system, it is convenient to introduce the nor\u2217\nmalized effective mass MN\nand the normalized temperature TN dividing the effective mass M \u2217 and temperature\n\u2217\nT by their maximal values, MM\nand TM respectively. The\n\np-3\n\n\fV.R.

As a result, we obtain [15]\n\u0010p\n\u0011\n\u2217\n\u03c7N = (Cmag /T )N =\n1/T1T\n= MN\n,\n(4)\n\n(K)\n\n20\n\nT\n\nmax\n\nmax\n\n0.006\n\n10\n\nN\n\n0.004\n\np\nwhere \u03c7N , (C/T )N andp( 1/T1 T )N are the normalized\nvalues of \u03c7, C/T and 1/T1 T , respectively. As a typical example, the corresponding maximum values \u03c7max ,\n(C/T )max and Tmax used to normalize the susceptibility\nB [T]\nB [T]\n\u03c7 and C/T are shown in fig. 1, the panels A and C.

Right panel: the maxima \u03c7max of the functions\n\u03c7(T ) versus magnetic field B (see fig. 1, the panel A). The\nsolid curve is approximated by \u03c7max (B) = dB \u22122/3 , see eq.

(5) to clarify our calculations\nbased on eq. (1). The variables B and T enter eq. (1)\nsymmetrically, therefore eq. (5) determines M \u2217 as a function of B at fixed T [15]. It follows directly from eqs. (3),\n(5) and (1) that\n\nB=7T\nB=9T\n\nmax\n\nHere c0 = (1 + c2 )/(1 + c1 ), c1 and c2 are fitting parameters, approximating the Landau amplitude. Since magnetic field B enters eq. (1) only in combination B\u03bcB /T ,\nwe have Tmax \u221d B\u03bcB [15, 23], where \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton.

Equations (7) and (8)\nconfirm the scaling behavior of both \u03c7T 0.66 and M T \u22120.34\nexperimentally established in Ref. [6]\nNow we construct the schematic phase diagram of\nZnCu3 (OH)6 Cl2 . This is reported in fig. 2. At T = 0\nand B = 0 the system is located near FCQPT without\ntuning. In fact, it located in front of FCQPT since C(T )\ndemonstrates the LFL behavior characterized by the linear T -dependence at low temperatures [4]. Both magnetic\nfield B and temperature T play role of the control parameters, driving the system from NFL to LFL regions as\nshown by the vertical and horizontal arrows. It follows\nfrom fig. 3 that in accordance with eq. (4) the behavior\nof \u03c7N coincides with that of (C/T )N in YbRh2 Si2 . Figure\n4, the right and left panels correspondingly, demonstrates\nthat eqs. (6) and (3) are in a good agreement with the\nexperimental facts.\n\n10\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\nby eq. (9) is extracted from measurements of C(B) on\nZnCu3 (OH)6 Cl2 at different magnetic fields shown in the legend [5]. Right panel: The temperatures Tmax (B) at which the\nmaxima of Cmag /T (see the left panel) are located. The solid\nline represents the function Tmax \u221d B, see eq. (6).\n\nAccording to eq. (4), in the case of QSL the behavior\nof the specific heat (Cmag /T )N must coincide with that of\n\u03c7N . To separate Cmag contribution, we approximate the\ngeneral specific heat C(T ) at T > 2 K by the function\nC(T ) = a1 T 3 + a2 T 1/3 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the first term proportional to a1 is due to the lattice\n(phonon) contribution and the second one is determined\nby the QSL when QSL exhibits the NFL behavior as it\nfollows from eq. (2). It is seen from fig. 1, the panel B,\nthat the approximation is valid in the wide temperature\n\np-4\n\n\fIdentification of Spin Liquid\nTo clarify the scaling behavior in that case, we normalize\nboth the function 1/T1 T and the magnetic field. Namely,\nwe normalize (1/T1 T ) by its value at the inflection point,\nand magnetic field is normalized by Binf , BN = B/Binf .\n\u2217 2\nIt follows from eq. (4) that (1/T1 T )N = (MN\n) and we\nexpect that different strongly correlated Fermi systems located near FCQPT exhibit the same behavior of the normalized spin-lattice relaxation rate [15]. It is seen from\nfig. 8, that both herbertsmithite ZnCu3 (OH)6 Cl2 [26] and\nHF metal YbCu5\u2212x Aux [27] demonstrate similar behavior of the normalized spin-lattice relaxation rate. As seen\nfrom fig. 8, at B \u2264 Binf (or BN \u2264 1) the normalized relaxation rate (1/T1 T )N depends weakly on the magnetic\nfield, while at higher fields (1/T1 T )N diminishes in agree\u2217 2\nment with eq. (3), (1/T1 T )N = (MN\n) \u221d B \u22124/3 . Thus,\nin accordance with the phase diagram shown in fig. 2,\nwe conclude that the application of magnetic field B leads\nto crossover from the NFL to LFL behavior and to the\nsignificant reduction in the relaxation rate.\n\n1.2\n\nN\n\nNORMALIZED MASS\n\nrange. We note that the value of a1 is almost independent of a2 , the presence of which allows us to achieve a\nbetter approximation for C. The obtained heat capacity\nCmag /T = (C \u2212 a1 T 3 )/T is displayed in the left panel of\nfig. 5, while the right panel B demonstrates the maximum temperature as a function of the magnetic field B.\nIt is seen that Cmag /T \u221d M \u2217 behaves like \u03c7 \u221d M \u2217 shown\nin fig. 1, the panel A. In figs. 6 and 7, the normalized\n(Cmag /T )N and \u03c7N are depicted. It is seen from both\nthese figures that the results obtained on different samples\nand measurements [4, 5] exhibit similar properties. As it\nis seen from figs. 3, 6 and 7 that in accordance with eq.\n(4), (Cmag /T )N \u2243 \u03c7N displays the same scaling behavior\nas (C/T )N measured on the HF metal YbRh2 Si2 . Therefore, the scaling behavior of the thermodynamic functions\nof herbertsmithite is the intrinsic feature of the compound\nand has nothing to do with magnetic impurities. This observation rules out a possible supposition that extra Cu\nspins outside the kagome planes considered as paramagnetic weakly interacting impurities could be responsible\nfor the divergent behavior of the susceptibility at low temperatures seen from fig. 1, the panel A. In that case the\nsupposition is to lead to explanations of the observed scaling behavior of \u03c7 and C/T in magnetic fields shown in figs.\n3, 6 and 7. Obviously, it is impossible.\n\n1.2\n\nNORMALIZED MASS\n\nN\n\n(C\n\n(T )\n\nN\n\nN\n\n0.8\n\n)\n\n(C\n\n/T)\n\nmag\n\nN\n\nB=3T\n\nB=1T\n\nB=5T\n\nB=2T\n\nB=7T\n\nB=3T\n\nB=10T\n\nB=5T\n\nB=14T\n\nB=10T\nB=14T\n\n0.4\n\nB=0T\n\nB=3T\n\nZnCu (OH) Cl\n\nB=1T\n\nB=5T\n\n3\n\n6\n\n2\n\nB=2T\n\nB=7T\n\n0.8\n\n/T)\n\nmag\n\nN\n\n(T\n\nB=3T\n\nB=10T\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\nT\n\nB=5T\n\nB=14T\n\nN\n\nB=7T\nB=9T\n\nTheory\n\n0.4\n\nZnCu (OH) Cl\n3\n\n0\n\n6\n\nFig. 7: The normalized susceptibility \u03c7N and the normalized\nspecific heat (Cmag /T )N of QSL effective mass versus normalized temperature TN as a function of the magnetic fields shown\nin the legends. \u03c7N and (Cmag /T )N are extracted from the data\nof [6] and [4], respectively.\n\n2\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nT\n\nN\n\n\u2217\nFig. 6: The normalized susceptibility \u03c7N = \u03c7/\u03c7max = MN\nand\n\u2217\nthe normalized specific heat (Cmag /T )N = MN of QSL effective mass versus normalized temperature TN as a function of\nthe magnetic fields shown in the legends. \u03c7N is extracted from\nthe measurements of the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7 in magnetic\nfields B [6] shown in the panel A of fig. 1.

Our calculations are depicted by the solid curve\n\u2217\ntracing the scaling behavior of MN\n.\n\nFigure 8 displays the normalized spin-lattice relaxation\nrates (1/T1 T )N at fixed temperature versus normalized\nmagnetic field BN . We notice from fig. 8 that the magnetic field B progressively reduces 1/T1 T , and the spinlattice relaxation rate as a function of B possesses an inflection point at some B = Binf shown by the arrow.\n\nAs it was mentioned above, QSL plays a role of HF\nliquid framed into the insulating compound. Thus, we\nexpect that QSL in herbertsmithite behaves like the electronic liquid in HF metals if the charge of an electron\nwere zero. In that case, the thermal resistivity w = LT /\u03ba,\nw = w0 + Aw T 2 , of QSL behaves like the electrical resistivity \u03c1 = \u03c10 + A\u03c1 T 2 of the electronic liquid, since\nAw represents the contribution of spinon-spinon scattering to thermal transport, being analogous to the contribution A\u03c1 to charge transport by electron-electron scattering. Here, L is the Lorenz number, \u03ba is the thermal\nconductivity of QSL, \u03c10 and w0 are residual resistivity\nof the electronic liquid and QSL, respectively, and coefficient Aw \u223c A\u03c1 \u221d (M \u2217 )2 [15, 28]. Thus, we predict that\nthe coefficient Aw of the thermal resistivity of QSL under\nthe application of magnetic fields at fixed temperature be-\n\np-5\n\n\fV.R.

The inflection point where the\nnormalization is taken is shown by the arrow. Our calculations\nbased on eq. (1) are depicted by the solid curve tracing the\n\u2217 2\nscaling behavior of (MN\n) .\n\nTo conclude, we have calculated the thermodynamic\nand relaxation properties of herbertsmithite. Our calculations unveil the fundamental properties of QSL, forming strongly correlated Fermi system located at FCQPT.\nThese are in a good agreement with experimental data and\nallow us to detect the behavior of QSL as that observed\nin heavy fermion metals. The key features of our findings are the presence of spin-charge separation and QSL\nformed with itinerant heavy spinons in herbertsmithite.\nHerbertsmithite represents a fascinating experimental example when the new particles-spinons, non-existing as\nfree ones, totally replace the initial particles entering the\nHamiltonian to dominate the properties at low temperatures. It is highly desirable to perform the detailed experimental studies of the transport properties of herbertsmithite. Also, conditions for spinons to form a superfluid\nliquid remain to be explored.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] Balents L., Nature, 464 (2010) 199.\n[2] Anderson P. W., Mater. Res.
