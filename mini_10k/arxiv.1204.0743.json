It was understood that RIAFs are likely\nto be convectively unstable in the radial direction due\nto the inward increase of the entropy of accreting gas\n(Narayan & Yi 1994). Moreover, hydrodynamical and\nmagetohydrodynamical simulations of low-viscosity RIAFs have confirmed these flows are convectively unstable ( e. g. Igumenshchev et al. 1996; Stone et al. 1999;\nKazem Faghei and Mobina Omidvand\nSchool of Physics, Damghan University, Damghan, Iran\ne-mail: kfaghei@du.ac.ir\n\nMachida et al. 2001; Hawley & Balbus 2002; McKinney & Gammie 2002; Igumenshchev et al. 2003). Selfsimilar or global solutions for convection-dominated accretion flows (CDAFs) were presented by several authors (e. g. Narayan et al. 2000; Quataert & Gruzinov\n2000; Abramowicz et al. 2002; Lu et al. 2004; Zhang\n& Dai 2008).\nIgumenshchev et al. (2003) studied the resistive\nMHD simulations of RIAFs onto black holes. They assumed two cases for the geometry of the injected magnetic field: pure toroidal field and pure poloidal field.\nThey found that in the case of pure toroidal magnetic\nfield, the accreting gas forms a nearly axisymmetric, geometrically thick, turbulent accretion disc. Moreover,\ntheir solutions represented that the flow resembles in\nmany respects CDAFs found in previous numerical and\nanalytical investigations of viscous hydrodynamic flows.\nZhang & Dai (2008) investigated the effect of magnetic\nfield on RIAFs with convection by a semi-analytically\nmethod. By exploit of \u03b1-prescription for viscosity and\nconvection, they used two methods to study of magnetized flows with convection, i.e. they take the convective coefficient \u03b1c as a free parameter to discuss the\neffects of convection for simplicity. They also established the \u03b1c -\u03b1 relation for magnetized flows using the\nmixing-length theory and compare this relation with\nthe non-magnetized case. They found that the magnetic field makes the \u03b1c -\u03b1 relation be distinct from that\nof non-magnetized flows.\nSince the importance of toroidal magnetic field and\nresistivity in accretion flows have been confirmed observationally (see Faghei 2011 and references therein),\nFaghei (2011) considered the steady, radially selfsimilar solutions of accretion flows in the presence of\nthe toroidal magnetic field and the resistivity. However, he ignored the effects of convection in his model.\nGenerally semi-analytical studies of magnetized CDAFs\nare related to non-resistive magnetized CDAFs (e. g.\n\n\f2\n\nZhang & Dai 2008) and the resistive and magnetized\nCDAF was studied in MHD simulations (e. g. Igumenshchev & Narayan 2002; Hawley & Balbus 2002;\nIgumenshchev et al. 2003). Thus, it will be interesting to study the effects of resistivity on RIAFs with\nconvection. Here, we adopt the presented solutions\nby Narayan et al. (2000) and Faghei (2011). Similar to\nNarayan et al. (2000), we will discuss the effects of convection on angular momentum and energy equations.\nThe paper is organized as follow. In section 2, the basic equations of constructing a model for quasi-spherical\nmagnetized RIAFs with convection will be defined. In\nsection 3, a self-similar method for solving equations\nwhich govern the behavior of the accreting gas was utilized. The summary of the model will appear in section\n4.\n\n2 Basic Equations\nAnalytical theory of CDAF is based on a self-similar\nsolution of a simplified set of equations describing RIAFs. We adopted the presented solutions by Narayan\net al. (2000) and Faghei (2011). By using spherical coordinate (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) centered on a accreting object, let\nus consider stationary, axisymmetric, quasi-spherical\nequations describing an accretion flow onto the black\nhole of mass M . For the sake of simplicity, the generalrelativistic effect has been neglected and the gravitational force on a fluid is characterized by Newtonian\npotential of a point mass, \u03c8 = \u2212GM/r. As magnetic\nfields, we consider only toroidal fields, B\u03c6 .\nUnder these assumptions, the continuity equation\nwith mass loss is\n1 d 2\n(r \u03c1vr ) = \u03c1\u0307,\nr2 dr\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c1, vr and \u03c1\u0307 are the density, the accretion velocity (vr < 0), and the mass-loss per unit volume,\nrespectively.\nThe radial momentum equation is\nvr\n\n\u0001 1 d\nc2\n1 d\ndvr\n= r \u03a92 \u2212 \u03a92K \u2212\n(\u03c1c2s ) \u2212 A \u2212\n(\u03c1c2 ),\ndr\n\u03c1 dr\nr\n2\u03c1 dr A\n(2)\n\nwhere cs is sound speed, which is defined as c2s \u2261 pgas /\u03c1,\nwith being pgas as the gas pressure, \u03a9 is the angular\n\u00011/2\nvelocity, \u03a9K [= GM/r3\n] is the Keplerian angular\nvelocity, and cA is the alfven speed, which is defined\nas c2A \u2261 B\u03c62 /4\u03c0\u03c1 = 2pmag /\u03c1, with being pmag as the\nmagnetic pressure. The ram-pressure term vr dvr /dr\nand last two terms due to the magnetic field in this\n\nequation were ignored in the self-similar CDAF model\nof Narayan et al. (2000), while we include them here in\norder to consider their effects.\nThe angular momentum equations can be written\nin the form of the balance of advection and diffusion\ntransport terms (Narayan et al. 2000),\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 d\nd 2\n4 d\u03a9\n\u03bd\u03c1r\n+\n\u03c1vr (r \u03a9) = 2\ndr\nr dr\n\u2202r\n\u0014\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0015\n1 d\n(5+3g)/2 d\n3(1\u2212g)/2\n\u03bdc \u03c1r\n,\n(3)\n\u03a9r\nr2 dr\ndr\nwhere the two terms of right hand side represent the\nangular momentum transport by viscosity and convection. Here, \u03bd is the kinematic viscosity coefficient, \u03bdc is\nthe convective diffusion coefficient, and g is the parameter to determine the condition of convective angular\nmomentum transport. When g = 1, the flux of angular\nmomentum due to convection is\nd\u03a9\n.\nJ \u0307c = \u2212\u03bdc \u03c1 r4\ndr\n\n(4)\n\nThe above equation implies that the convective angular momentum flux is oriented down the angular velocity gradient. For a quasi-Keplerian angular velocity,\n\u03a9 \u221d r\u22123/2 , angular momentum is transported outward.\nWhen g = \u22121/3, the convective angular momentum\nflux can be written as\n\u0001\n2\n2 d \u03a9r\n \u0307\n.\n(5)\nJc = \u2212\u03bdc \u03c1 r\ndr\nThis equation represents that the convective angular\nmomentum flux is oriented down the specific angular\nmomentum gradient. For a quasi-Keplerian angular velocity, \u03a9 \u221d r\u22123/2 , angular momentum is transported\ninward. Generally, convection transports angular momentum inward (or outward) for g < 0 (or > 0), and\nthe specific case g = 0 corresponds to zero angular momentum transport (Narayan et al. 2000).\nIn this paper, we assume the kinematic coefficient of\nviscosity and the magnetic diffusivity due to turbulence\nin the accretion flow. So, we use these parameters in\nanalogy to the \u03b1-prescription of Shakura & Sunyaev\n(1973) for the turbulent,\n\u03bd = Pm \u03b7 = \u03b1\n\nc2s\n,\n\u03a9K\n\n(6)\n\nwhere Pm is the magnetic Prandtl number of the turbulence, which assumed to be a constant less than unity,\n\u03b7 is the magnetic diffusivity, and \u03b1 is a free parameter\nless than unity. For the convective diffusion coefficient,\n\u03bdc , we adopt the assumptions of Narayan et al. (2000)\nand Lu et al. (2004) that all transport phenomena due\n\n\f3\n\nto convection have the same diffusion coefficient, which\nis defined as\n\u0012 2 \u0013q\nLM\n2 ,\n\u2212Nef\n(7)\n\u03bdc =\nf\n4\nwhere LM is the characteristic mixing length and Nef f\nis the effective frequency of convective blobs. The characteristic mixing length LM in terms of the pressure\nscale height, Hp , can be written as\nLM = 2\u22121/4 lM Hp ,\n\nHp = \u2212\n\ndr\n,\nd ln pgas\n\n(8)\n\nwhere lM is the dimensionless mixing-length\n\u221a parameter\nand its amount is estimated to be equal to 2 in ADAFs\n(Narayan et al. 2000; Lu et al. 2004). the effective\nfrequency of convective blobs, Nef f , is given by\n2\n2\n2\nNef\nf = N +\u03ba ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere N is Brunt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency, which is defined\nas\n!\n1/\u03b3\n1 dpgas d\npgas\n2\nN =\u2212\n,\n(10)\nln\n\u03c1 dr dr\n\u03c1\nand \u03ba is epicyclic frequency, which is defined as\n\u03ba2 = 2\u03a92\n\nd ln(\u03a9r2 )\n.\nd ln r\n\n(11)\n\n\u2212\u2207 * Fconv , with being Fconv [= \u2212\u03c1\u03bdc T ds/dr] as the\noutward energy flux due to convection. For the right\nhand side of the energy equation, we can write\n\u0001\n1 d 2\nr Fconv ,\n2\nr dr\n\nQadv = f Qdiss \u2212\n\n(15)\n\nwhere Qadv is the advective transport of energy, and\nf [= 1 \u2212 Qrad /Qdiss ] is the advection parameter. The\nparameter f measures the degree to which the flow is\nadvection-dominated (Narayan & Yi 1994). The dissipative heating rate can be written as\nQdiss = (\u03bd + g\u03bdc )\u03c1r2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202\u03a9\n\u2202r\n\n\u00132\n\n+\n\n\u03b7 2\nJ ,\n4\u03c0\n\n(16)\n\nwhere the right-hand side terms are heating rate due\nto viscosity, convection, and resistivity, respectively. In\nabove equation, J[= \u2207 \u00d7 B] is the current density, with\nbeing B as the magnetic field.\nFinally, the induction equation with creation/escape\nof magnetic field can be written as\n\u0014\n\u0015\nd\n1 d\nrvr B\u03c6 \u2212 \u03b7 (rB\u03c6 ) = \u1e02\u03c6 .\n(17)\nr dr\ndr\nwhere B\u03c6 is the toroidal component of magnetic field\nand \u1e02\u03c6 is the field escaping/creating rate due to a magnetic instability or dynamo effect. This induction equation is rewritten as\n\u1e02\u03c6 =\n\u0012\n\u0014q\n\u0013\u0015\n\u03b1\n1 d 2 2\n1 d\n2\n4\u03c0\u03c1cA rvr \u2212\n(r \u03c1cA ) , (18)\nr dr\n4\u03c7Pm r\u03c1\u03a9K dr\n\nFor a non-Keplerian flows \u03ba 6= \u03a9, while for a quasiKeplerian (\u03a9 \u221d r\u22123/2 ), \u03ba = \u03a9 (Narayan et al. 2000;\nLu et al. 2004). Convection appears in flows with\n2\nNef\nf < 0.

Since we have not applied the effects of wind in the momentum and energy\nequations, we will assume a no wind case, \u03c1\u0307 = 0 and\n\u03bb = \u22123/2. In this case, \u1e02\u03c6 \u221d r\u221211/4 , which implies\nthat creation/escape of magnetic field increases with\napproaching to central object. This property is qualitatively consistent with previous studies of accretion\nflows (Machida et al. 2006; Oda et al. 2007; Faghei &\nMollatayefeh 2012).\nUsing the self-similar solutions in the continuity, radial momentum, angular momentum, convection parameter, energy, and induction equations [(1)-(3), (13),\n(14), and (18)], we can obtain the following relations:\n\u0013\n\u0012\np\n3\n\u03b1\u03c10 c1 GM\u2217 ,\n\u03c1\u03070 = \u2212 \u03bb +\n2\n\n(27)\n\n1\n\u2212 c21 \u03b12 + 1 \u2212 c22 + c3 [\u03bb \u2212 1 + \u03c7(1 + \u03bb)] = 0,\n2\n\n(28)\n\n\u03b1c1 = 3(\u03b1 + g\u03b1c )(\u03bb + 2)c3 ,\n\n(29)\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n1\n+\u03bb =\n\u03b1c1\n\u03b3\u22121\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03b1c\n2\u03c7\n9\n2\n2\nc3 (1 + \u03bb)\n\u03b1f (1 +\ng)c2 +\n4\n\u03b1\n9Pm\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\n\u2212\u03b1c c3 (\u03bb + )\n+\u03bb\n2 \u03b3\u22121\nl2\n\u03b1c = \u221a M\n4 2c3 (\u03bb \u2212 1)2\n\ns\n\n(30)\n\nc3 (\u03bb \u2212 1)\n[\u03bb(1 \u2212 \u03b3) \u2212 1] \u2212 c22 ,\n\u03b3\n\nIn this case, we take the convective coefficient \u03b1c as a\nfree parameter to discuss the effects of convection for\nsimplicity. Examples of such solutions are presented in\nFigures 1 and 2.\nIn Figure 1, the self-similar coefficients c1 , c2 , and c3\nare shown as functions of the parameter \u03c7. By adding\nthe parameter \u03c7 which indicates the role of magnetic\nfiled on the dynamics of accretion discs, we see the coefficients of radial and rotational velocities and sound\nspeed decrease. This properties are qualitatively consistent with results of Faghei (2011). In Figure 1, we\nalso studied the effect of convection parameter \u03b1c on\nthe physical variables. The value of \u03b1c measures the\nstrength of convective viscosity and a larger \u03b1c denotes\na stronger turbulence due to convection. Figure 1 implies that for non-zero \u03b1c , the radial infall velocity is\nlower than the standard ADAF solution and for larger\n\u03b1c this reduction of radial infall velocity is more evident. It can be due to decrease of efficiency of angular\nmomentum transport by adding the convection parameter \u03b1c (see equation 29). The profiles of angular velocity show that it decreases with the magnitude of \u03b1c ,\nwhile the sound speed increases. These properties are\nin accord with results of Zhang & Dai (2008).\nIn Figure 2, the physical variables are shown as functions of parameter \u03c7 for several values of magnetic\nPrandtl number. Since inverse of magnetic Prandtl\nnumber is proportional to magnetic diffusivity, Pm \u221d\n\u03b7 \u22121 . Thus, reduce of magnetic Prandtl number denotes\nto increase of resistivity of the fluid. The solutions in\nFigure 2 imply that the accretion velocity and the sound\nspeed both increase with the magnitude of resistivity,\nwhile the rotational velocity decreases. These properties qualitatively confirm the results of Faghei (2011).\n\n\f5\n\n0.52\n0.36\n\n0.10\n\n0.50\n\n0.08\n\n0.48\n\nc3\n\nc22\n\nc1\n\n0.34\n0.46\n\n0.06\n\n0.44\n\n0.32\n\n0.04\n0.42\n0.02\n0.40\n\n0.30\n0.00\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.20\n\n0.50\n\n0.05\n\n1.00\n\n0.10\n\n\u03a7\n\n0.20\n\n0.50\n\n1.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n\u03a7\n\n0.20\n\n0.50\n\n1.00\n\n\u03a7\n\nFig. 1 Physical variables as functions\u221a of \u03c7 for several values of convective viscosity.

Because we used a\nsteady self-similar method to derive \u03b1c , it becomes a\nconstant throughout of the accreting gas. However, it\nis a function of position and time (e. g. Lu et al. 2004).\nThe amount of convection parameter \u03b1c is calculated by\nequation (31). Using this equation and equation (28)(30), we can obtain the behavior of physical quantities\nin the presence of convection. Such solutions are shown\nin Figure 3.\nIn Figure 3, the coefficients c1 , c2 , c3 , and convection parameter \u03b1c are shown as functions of the degree\nof magnetic pressure. Similar to case 1, the accretion\nand rotational velocities, and sound speed decrease by\n\nadding the parameter \u03c7. While, the convection parameter \u03b1c increases for stronger toroidal magnetic field.\nThis property is qualitatively consistent with result of\nZhang & Dai (2008). In Figure 3, the physical variables\nare also studied for several values of magnetic Prandtl\nnumber. The profiles of convection parameter \u03b1c imply\nthat it increases by adding the magnetic diffusivity. As\nfor non-zero magnetic diffusivity, \u03b1c is larger than the\nstandard CDAF solution and for larger magnetic diffusivity this increase of convection parameter \u03b1c is more\nevident.\n\n5 Summary and Discussion\nThe observational features of low-luminosity state of Xray binaries and nuclei of galaxies can be successfully\n\n\f6\n0.11\n\n0.50\n\n0.10\n0.09\n\n0.46\n\nc22\n\nc1\n\n0.48\n\n0.44\n\n0.08\n0.07\n0.06\n\n0.42\n\n0.05\n0.04\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.20\n\n0.50\n\n1.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n\u03a7\n\n0.20\n\n0.50\n\n1.00\n\n0.50\n\n1.00\n\n\u03a7\n\n0.34\n\n0.055\n\n0.33\n\n0.050\n\n0.31\n\n\u0391c\n\nc3\n\n0.32\n0.045\n\n0.30\n\n0.040\n\n0.29\n\n0.035\n\n0.28\n0.030\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.20\n\n0.50\n\n1.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n\u03a7\n\n0.20\n\n\u03a7\n\nFig. 3 Physical variables as functions\nof \u03c7 for several values of magnetic Prandtl number.

The solid, dashed, and dotted lines represent Pm = \u221e, 1.0,\nand 0.5, respectively.\n\nexplained by the models of radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). The importance of convection in\nRIAFs was realized by semi-analytical and direct numerical simulation (e. g. Narayan et al. 2000; Igumenshchev et al. 2003).\nIn this research, we considered the effects of convection on the presented model of Faghei (2011). Similar to Narayan et al. (2000), we assumed the convection affects on transports of angular momentum and\nenergy. Using a radially self-similar approach, we studied the effects of convection on the model for several\nvalues of magnetic field and resistivity. The solutions\nshowed that the accretion and rotational velocities, and\nsound speed decrease for stronger magnetic filed. Moreover, we found that the accretion velocity and sound\nspeed increase with the magnitude of the resistivity,\nwhile the rotational velocity decreased. These properties are qualitatively consistent with results of Faghei\n(2011). We studied the effects of convection on a resistive and magnetized RIAF in two cases: assuming\nthe convection parameter as a free parameter and using mixing length theory to calculate the convection\nparameter. In the first case, we found that by adding\nthe convection parameter, the radial and rotational velocities decrease and the sound speed increases. In the\n\nsecond case, we found that the convection parameter\nincreases by adding the magnetic filed and resistivity.\nThese properties are in many aspects in accord with\nresults of Zhang & Dai (2008).\nThe present model have some limitations that can\nbe modified in the future works. For example, the latitudinal dependence of physical variables have been ignored in this paper. While, two-dimensional and threedimensional MHD simulations of RIAFs show that the\ndisc geometry strongly depends on magnetic field configuration (e. g. Igumenshchev et al. 2003). Thus, the\nstudy of present model in two/three dimensions can be\nan interesting subject for future research. Moreover,\nit has been understood the magnetic field can change\nthe criterion for convective instability (e. g. Balbus &\nHawley 2002). While, we igonred the effects of magnetic field on the instability criterion. Thus, the presented criterion in this paper can be modified in the\nfuture research.\nAcknowledgements\nI wish to thank the anonymous referee for very useful\ncomments that helped us to improve the initial version\nof the paper.\n\n\f7\n\nReferences\nAbramowicz M.
