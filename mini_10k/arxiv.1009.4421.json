In addition to the coupling constant g 2 of the\nundeformed N = (2, 2) model, there is the second coupling constant \u03b3 describing\nthe strength of the heterotic deformation. We calculate both \u03b2 functions, \u03b2g and\n\u03b2\u03b3 at one loop determining the flow of g 2 and \u03b3. Under a certain choice of the\ninitial conditions, the theory is asymptotically free. The \u03b2 function for the ratio\n\u03c1 = \u03b3 2 /g 2 exhibits an infrared fixed point at \u03c1 = 1/2. Formally this fixed point\nlies outside the validity of the one-loop approximation.

The reason is the enhancement\nof symmetry \u2013 emergence of a chiral fermion flavor symmetry in the heterotically\ndeformed Lagrangian \u2013 at \u03c1 = 1/2.

Deforming these models in various ways\n(i.e. breaking supersymmetry down to N = 1) one arrives at heterotically deformed\nCP(N \u2212 1) models [6, 7, 8, 9] (heterotic CP(N \u2212 1) models for short), a very interesting and largely unexplored class of models characterized by two coupling constants:\nthe original asymptotically free coupling and an extra one describing the strength\nof the heterotic deformation. These two-dimensional models are of importance on\ntheir own, since they exhibit highly nontrivial dynamics, with a number of phase\ntransitions. This fact was recently revealed [10] in the large-N solution of the model\n(see also [11]).\nOur current task is to analyze perturbative aspects of the heterotic CP(N \u2212 1)\nmodels. General aspects of perturbation theory in the N = (0, 2) models were\ndiscussed by Witten [12]. We will study particular renormalization properties and\ncalculate the \u03b2 functions in the CP(N \u22121) models heterotically deformed in a special\nway. In this first paper of a series we will focus on one-loop effects and demonstrate\nthat both couplings of the model enjoy asymptotic freedom (AF). Moreover, we\nobserve a special fixed-point regime in the infrared (IR) domain and argue that it\nholds beyond one loop.\nWritten in components, the Lagrangian of the heterotic CP(1) model takes the\nform [7]\n\u001b\n\u001a\n2 \u2020\n1\n\u2020\n\u03bc\n\u2020\n\u03bc\n\u2020\n/ \u2212 2i \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03c8 \u03c6 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 2 \u03c8L \u03c8L \u03c8R \u03c8R ,\n(1)\nL(2,2) = G \u2202 \u03c6\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 + i\u03c8\u0304 \u2202\u03c8\n\u03c7\n\u03c7\nand 2\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\u0001\n\u03b3\n\u2020\nL(0,2) =\n+ 2 \u03b6R R i \u2202L \u03c6 \u03c8R + H.c.\ng\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u0011\n|\u03b3|2 \u0010 \u2020 \u0011 \u0010\n2|\u03b3|2 \u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n+ 2 \u03b6R \u03b6R R \u03c8L \u03c8L + G\n\u03c8 \u03c8L \u03c8R \u03c8R ,\ng\ng 2 \u03c72 L\n\u03b6R\u2020 i\u2202L \u03b6R\n\n(2)\n\n\u2020\n\u2020\nThe sign in front of the term \u03b6R\n\u03b6R \u03c8L\n\u03c8L in (2) is opposite to that in [7] due to a typo in [7].\nAlso notice that the definition of \u03b3 in this paper corresponds to \u03b3g 2 in [7]. The reason for this\nrescaling of the deformation parameter compared to [7] is that g 2 and \u03b3 2 as defined here are the\ngenuine loop expansion parameters.\n2\n\n2\n\n\fwhere G is the K\u00e4hler metric on the target space,\nG=\n\n2\ng 2 \u03c72\n\nR is the Ricci tensor,\nR=\n\n,\n\n2\n,\n\u03c72\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nand we use the notation\n\u03c7 \u2261 1 + \u03c6 \u03c6\u2020 .\n\n(5)\n\nThe coupling g 2 enters through the metric, while the deformation coupling \u03b3 appears\nin Eq. (2). Both couplings can be chosen to be real.3 Setting g 2 to be real means we\nwill not consider the topological term \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03bd \u03c6\u2020 in this paper. To make \u03b3 real, one\nshould perform a phase rotation of the bosonic field \u03c6 absorbing the phase of \u03b3 (see\nthe first line in Eq. (2)). In fact, this corresponds to a kind of R-symmetry, as the\nreader will see from the N = (0, 2) superfield formalism In Sec. 2. Our main results\nare presented by the following expressions for the one-loop \u03b2 functions:\n\u03b2g\n\n\u2202 2\ng4\n\u2261\ng (\u03bc) = \u2212\n+ ...\n\u2202ln\u03bc\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03b2\u03b3 \u2261\n\n\u0001\n\u03b3\n\u2202\n\u03b3 2 \u2212 g 2 + ...\n\u03b3(\u03bc) =\n\u2202ln\u03bc\n2\u03c0\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nwhere ellipses stand for two-loop and higher-order terms. The heterotic deformation\ndoes not affect \u03b2g which stays the same as in the N = (2, 2) CP(1) model. Among\nother results, we calculate the law of running of the ratio\n\u03c1=\n\n\u03b32\ng2\n\nsee Eq. (50). If at any renormalization point, in particular, in the ultraviolet (UV)\nlimit, \u03c1 is chosen to be smaller than 1/2, in the IR limit it runs to \u03c1 \u2192 1/2, which is\nthe fixed point for this parameter. With \u03c1 \u2264 1/2, the theory is asymptotically free.\nAnalogs of Eqs. (6) and (7) in the heterotic CP(N \u2212 1) model with arbitrary N are\npresented in (55) and (57).\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we describe the model using both\nsuperfield language and component field language. We show that the N = (0, 2)\n3\n\nHowever, in Secs. 2 and 3 we will treat \u03b3 as a complex coupling in analyzing generalized U(1)\nsymmetries and for similar purposes.\n\n3\n\n\fdeformation structure is quite unique in certain sense. In Sec. 3, we show that by\nsymmetry analysis, the renormalization structure of the deformation term is constrained. Conceptually it gives partially the answer for why the deformation term\ndoes not get renormalized at one-loop level. In Sec. 4 we describe the linear background field method and calculate the one-loop \u03b2 function for g 2 as an example. This\nwill be useful in the two-loop calculations shown in our subsequent paper. In Sec. 5\nwe calculate the Z-factor wave-function renormalizations for the field \u03b6R and \u03c8R . In\nSec. 6 we calculate the one-loop \u03b2 function for \u03b3, and thus verify our expectation in\nSec. 3. In Sec. 7 we discuss the running of the two couplings. We find the region that\nis good for perturbative calculation, and we find an IR fixed point of \u03c1 that exists\nuniversally at one-loop order. In Sec. 8 we generalize the result to CP(N \u2212 1) model.\nWe show that a factorization of \u03b2\u03c1 survives in all loop orders. In the subsequent\npaper we will discuss the result from the two-loop calculation.\n\nN = (0, 2) CP(1) sigma model\n\n2\n\nHere we will briefly review basics of the heterotic CP(1) model. The metric (3) is\nthe Fubini\u2013Study metric of the two-dimensional sphere S 2 . It is not difficult to see\nthat the Lagrangian L(2,2) + L(0,2) is invariant with respect to the joint U(1) rotations of the fields \u03c6 and \u03c8, and, in addition, invariant under the following nonlinear\ntransformations:\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 + \u03b1 + \u03b1 \u2020 \u03c62 ,\n\n\u03c6\u2020 \u2192 \u03c6\u2020 + \u03b1\u2020 + \u03b1\u03c6\u20202 ,\n\n\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8 + 2\u03b1\u2020 \u03c6\u03c8 ,\n\n\u03c8\u0304 \u2192 \u03c8\u0304 + 2\u03b1\u03c6\u2020 \u03c8\u0304.\n\n(8)\n\nHere \u03b1 is a complex constant. The above transformations tell us that \u03c6 transforms as\nthe coordinate of the target manifold (a 2-sphere), and the fields \u03c8 and \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6 transform\nas the tangent vectors.\nSupersymmetry of this model is best understood via its superfield description.\nThe N = (0, 2) model description can be obtained by either integrating out the\nGrassmannian variables \u03b8L and \u03b8L\u2020 [7], or by constructing the model from N = (0, 2)\nsuperfields.4 We will follow the second way, for reasons which will become clear\nshortly. We define the left and right derivatives as follows.\n\u2202R = \u2202t \u2212 \u2202z .\n\n\u2202L = \u2202t + \u2202z ,\n4\n\nOur conventions, as well as the N = (0, 2) superspace, are described in Appendix A.\n\n4\n\n(9)\n\n\fThe shifted space-time coordinates that satisfy the chiral condition are defined as\n\u2020\nx0L = t + i\u03b8R\n\u03b8R ,\n\n\u2020\nx1L = z + i\u03b8R\n\u03b8R .\n\n(10)\n\nWe start from two chiral N = (0, 2) superfields A and B,\n\u221a\nA(x\u03bcL , \u03b8R ) = \u03c6(x\u03bcL ) + 2\u03b8R \u03c8L (x\u03bcL ) ,\n\u221a\nB(x\u03bcL , \u03b8R ) = \u03c8R (x\u03bcL ) + 2\u03b8R F (x\u03bcL ) .\n\n(11)\n\nThe supersymmetry transformations are\n\u221a\n\u03b4R \u03c6 = 2\u01ebR \u03c8L ,\n\u221a\n\u03b4R \u03c8R = 2\u01ebR F ,\n\n(12)\n\n\u221a\n\u03b4R \u03c8L = \u2212 2i\u01eb\u2020R \u2202L \u03c6 ,\n\u221a\n\u03b4R F = \u2212 2i\u01eb\u2020R \u2202L \u03c8R .\n\nIn terms of these N = (0, 2) superfields, it is not difficult to show that the Lagrangian\nL(2,2)\n\n2\n= 2\ng\n\nZ\n\n2\n\nd \u03b8R\n\n\u001a\n\n2B \u2020 B\niA\u2020 \u2202R A \u2212 iA\u2202R A\u2020\n+\n1 + A\u2020 A\n(1 + A\u2020 A)2\n\n\u001b\n\n(13)\n\nidentically reproduces Eq. (1).\nNeedless to say, this Lagrangian is N = (0, 2) invariant, by construction. Next,\nwe must show that it is target-space invariant. The global U(1) symmetry of Eq. (13)\nis obvious. As far as the nonlinear transformations Eq. (8) are concerned, for the\nfirst term we have\n\u03b4\u03b1\n\n\u0001\nA\u2202R A\u2020 + A\u2020 \u2202R A\n\u221d \u03b1\u2202R A\u2020 + \u03b1\u2020 \u2202R A ,\n\u2020\n1+A A\n\n(14)\n\nwhich is a combination of holomorphic and antiholomorphic functions, and thus\nshould vanish in the action. Moreover, one can show that the second term is invariant\nby itself, i.e.,\nB\u2020B\n= 0.\n(15)\n\u03b4\u03b1\n(1 + A\u2020 A)2\nThe relative coefficient between the first and the second terms in Eq. (13) is unity\nbecause of the N = (2, 2) symmetry which is implicit in Eq. (13). One can, of course,\nintroduce another coupling constant in front of the term quadratic in the B field,\nbut then one can always absorb such constant in the normalization of B.\n5\n\n\fThus, with the given set of fields, starting from N = (0, 2) supersymmetry, we\nget an enhanced N = (2, 2) supersymmetry \"for free.\" This phenomenon is similar\nto the N = (1, 1) case, as shown in [13] (see also [14]).\nThis gives us a hint on the way of converting the N = (2, 2) model into its\nheterotic N = (0, 2) extension. Namely, one should add an interaction of the field B\nwith A and A\u2020 without involving the field B \u2020 . Taking into consideration the target\nspace symmetry, one can come up with the following deformation Lagrangian:\nZ\n4\u03b3 BA\u2020\n+ H.c. .\n(16)\n\u2206L = \u2212 d2 \u03b8R 2\ng 1 + A\u2020 A\nThe coupling \u03b3 has dimension m1/2 , and must be viewed as a complex Grassmann\nnumber. Now, in components, the deformation Lagrangian takes the form\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2206L = \u03b3 G(i\u2202L \u03c6\u2020 )\u03c8R + H.c. + |\u03b3|2 (G\u03c8R\u2020 \u03c8R ) .\n(17)\nThe above construction, however, suffers from the fermion number nonconservation.\nThe very last step which fixes this problem is promoting \u03b3 to a dynamic superfield.\nTo this end we introduce a chiral superfield 5\n\u221a\nB = \u03b6R + 2\u03b8R F ,\n(18)\n\nand then replace \u03b3 by\n\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3B.\n\nAs a result, the deformation Lagrangian takes the form\n\u0015\n\u001b\n\u001a\u0014\nZ\n4\u03b3 BBA\u2020\n\u2020\n2\n+ H.c. + 2B B\n\u2206L =\nd \u03b8R \u2212 2\ng 1 + A\u2020 A\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= i\u03b6R\u2020 \u2202L \u03b6R + \u03b3 \u03b6R G(i\u2202L \u03c6\u2020 )\u03c8R + H.c.\n\n+|\u03b3|2 (\u03b6R\u2020 \u03b6R )(G\u03c8R\u2020 \u03c8R ) + |\u03b3|2 G2 \u03c8L\u2020 \u03c8L \u03c8R\u2020 \u03c8R .\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\nThe target space invariance can be verified at the level of superfields,\nBBA\u2020\n\u221d \u03b1\u2020 BB ,\n\u03b4\u03b1\n\u2020\n1+A A\n\n(21)\n\nwhich vanishes in the action. Needless to say, the S 2 target space transformations of\nB are trivial, \u03b4B = 0.\n5\n\nWarning: the definition of the superfield B in this paper is slightly different from that in [7].\n\n6\n\n\fFields\n\nU(1)1\n\nU(1)2\n\nU(1)3\n\n\u03b3\n\n1\n\n0\n\nA\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u2212 21\n\nB\n\n0\n\n1\n\nB\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n\u2212 21\n1\n2\n\n\u2212 21\n\nTable 1: Generalized U(1) symmetries of the heterotically deformed CP(1) model.\nFinally, we comment on the absorption of the U(1) phase of the coupling \u03b3 in this\ncontext. This means that whenever \u03b3 = |\u03b3|ei\u03c9 , we can always redefine \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3e\u2212i\u03c9\nand A\u2020 \u2192 A\u2020 ei\u03c9 supplemented by a \u03b8R rotation. So \u03b3 can always be kept real.\nNotably, this rotation only involves bosons. This is because, we can assign a proper\nU(1) charge to \u03b8R to keep \u03c8L U(1)-neutral. Thus the rotation actually corresponds\nto a kind of R-symmetry. It is anomaly-free.\n\n3\n\nGlobal symmetries and renormalization structure\n\nIn this section we analyze the renormalization structure of the heterotic CP(1) model.\nIn the deformed model we have two dimensionless couplings, g and \u03b3. The first one\nis related to geometry of the target space, and the second one parametrizes the\nstrength of the heterotic deformation. The first question to ask at one-loop level is\nthat whether or not there is mixing between these two couplings. In addition, we\nshould verify that other structures, which are absent in Eq. (13) and Eq. (20), do\nnot show up as a result of loop corrections. What can be said from analyzing the\nsymmetries of the model at hand? We will follow the line of reasoning similar to\nthe proof [15] of nonrenormalization theorems for superpotentials in four dimensions.\nWe start from the U(1) symmetries.6 There are three generalized U(1) symmetries\nlisted in Table 1, with the corresponding charge assignments. Using these charge\nassignments one can show that the only nontrivial combination of \u03b3, A\u2020 , B, and B\ninvariant under all U(1) symmetries is given by \u03b3BBA\u2020 .\n\u2020\nSince \u2206L presents the integral over d\u03b8R and d\u03b8R\n, (unfortunately), it is not analogous to F terms in conventional supersymmetric Lagrangians. Hence, with radiative\n6\n\nThe coupling constant \u03b3 can and will be ascribed U(1) charges, as in [15].\n\n7\n\n\fcorrections included, \u2206L can possibly contain U(1)-neutral pairs such as A\u2020 A, B \u2020 B,\nB\u2020 B and the modulus of the coupling |\u03b3|2 . Due to dimensional reasons, B \u2020 B could\nonly show up in the combination of the type B \u2020 B/B\u2020 B, which, obviously, cannot\nhappen in loops provided our theory is properly regularized in the infrared domain\n(and, of course, it will be regularized both in the IR and UV domains). Its absence\ncan also be verified by analyzing a fermionic SU(2) symmetry discussed in Sec. 5.\nAs for A\u2020 A, this term is constrained by the non-linear target space symmetry.\nThe only allowed form is the combination\nBA\u2020\n1 + A\u2020 A\nand its Hermitian conjugate. This shows that the structure of the deformation is\nquite unique. Corrections in g 2 are strongly constrained too, as we will see momentarily. Thus, the corrections that can show up in loops are O(\u03b3 2 ), O(\u03b3 2g 2 ), O(\u03b3 4 ),\nand so on.\nThe latter circumstance becomes clear if we take into consideration that the\noperator R\u2202L \u03c6\u2020 \u03c8R is, in fact, the superconformal anomaly of the undeformed theory\n[7],\n\u221a\n\u2212i 2 \u2202L \u03c6\u2020 \u03c8R\nJsc,L =\n.\n(22)\n2\u03c0\n\u03c72\nSince the supercurrent is conserved, R\u2202L \u03c6\u2020 \u03c8R receives no corrections in g 2 , g 4, etc.\nCertainly, on general grounds we can not exclude corrections of the type |\u03b3|2 g 2, but\nthese can show up only in the second and higher loops. Therefore, at one loop the\ncorrections to \u03b3 come from O(|\u03b3|2) one-particle irreducible correction to the vertex,\nand the Z factors of the fields of which the deformation term is built. Calculation of\nthe Z factors is carried out in Sect. 5. We check all assertions made above on general\ngrounds by explicit calculation of relevant diagrams in Sect. 6.\n\n4\n\nBackground field method. One-loop \u03b2 function\nfor g 2\n\nWe will see shortly that \u03b2g is unaffected by the heterotic deformation at one loop.\nBefore passing to direct calculations of the Z-factors for the fields \u03b6R , \u03c8R , let us\noutline generalities of the background field method [16].7 The full power and efficiency of this method will become clear in two-loop calculations [17]. Here will just\n7\n\nFrom Eq. (13) it is obvious that the Z factor for the superfield A is unity.\n\n8\n\n\f\"calibrate\" it in the simple problem of the one-loop \u03b2 function \u03b2g . The result is\nwell-known, of course [18]; therefore, this exercise [16] is needed mostly to introduce\nnecessary conventions and notations.\nEach field is decomposed into a background part (large part) and a quantum part\n(small fluctuations to be integrated over). One can simplify calculations by making a\nparticularly convenient choice of the background fields, which may vary from problem\nto problem. Then one expands the Lagrangian in the given background, in terms of\nquantum fields. Linear terms can be omitted. Quadratic terms determine one-loop\ncorrections. Cubic and higher order terms are needed for two-loop calculations, i.e.\nfor higher orders. The two-loop calculations will be presented in a forthcoming paper\n[17]. Note that, generally speaking, the background field does not have to respect\nthe symmetry of the theory. However, the full symmetry must certainly be present\nin the final answer for Leff .\nAfter this remark we proceed to an instructive one-loop calculation of \u03b2g . The\nsplit of the fields is\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c60 + q\n(23)\nwhere q represents the quantum part to be integrated over in loops. For the background part we choose in the problem at hand\n\u03c60 = f e\u2212ikx ,\n\n\u03c6\u20200 = f \u2020 eikx ,\n\n\u03c6\u20200 \u03c60 = f \u2020 f ,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere f is a constant, and at the very end (after separating all terms quadratic in\nk) we can tend k \u2192 0. The fermion field is quantum, by definition. The background\nfield expression for the Lagrangian is\nL0 =\n\n2 k2 f \u2020f\n,\ng02 (1 + f \u2020 f )2\n\n(25)\n\nwhere g0 is the bare coupling (i.e. the coupling constant at the UV cut-off Muv . We\nwill concentrate on the boson contribution because the fermion loop at this level is\nfinite and, thus, does not contribute to the \u03b2 function, see Appendix B. The results\nin this appendix will be used in two-loop calculations.\nExpanding the Lagrangian up to the second order in the quantum fields, we\nobtain\n0,1 \u2020\n\u03bc \u2020\n\u03bc \u2020\n\u03bc \u2020\nL\u03c6(1) = (G1,0\n0 q + G0 q )\u2202\u03bc \u03c60 \u2202 \u03c60 + G0 (\u2202\u03bc q\u2202 \u03c60 + \u2202\u03bc \u03c60 \u2202 q ) ,\n0,2 \u20202\n1,1 \u2020\n2\n\u03bc \u2020\nL\u03c6(2) = (G2,0\n0 q + G0 q + G0 qq )\u2202\u03bc \u03c60 \u2202 \u03c60\n0,1 \u2020\n\u03bc \u2020\n\u03bc \u2020\n\u03bc \u2020\n+ (G1,0\n0 q + G0 q )(\u2202\u03bc q\u2202 \u03c60 + \u2202\u03bc \u03c60 \u2202 q ) + G0 \u2202\u03bc q\u2202 q\n\n9\n\n(26)\n\n\fwhere\nGi,j\n0 \u2261\n\n2\n1 \u2202i \u2202j\n2\ni\nj\u2020\ni!j! \u2202\u03c6 \u2202\u03c6 g0 (1 + \u03c6\u03c6\u2020 )2\n\n,\n\n(27)\n\n\u03c60 ,\u03c6\u20200\n\ndefined in Eq.

(26) extra source terms (irrelevant for what\nfollows) may be necessary in order to discard L\u03c6(1) because of its proportionality to\nthe equation of motion for the given background field.8\nIn calculating the graphs which determine the \u03b2 function one should keep in mind\nthat they are divergent both in the ultraviolet and infrared. To regularize the UV\ndivergence we will use dimensional reduction working in D = 2 \u2212 \u01eb dimensions. To\nregularize the IR divergence we introduce a small mass term for the quantum field\n(see [16]),\n\u0001\nLm = G0 \u2212m20 q \u2020 q \u2212 m0 \u03c8\u0304\u03c8 .\n(28)\n\nAt the very end both regularizing parameters, m0 and \u01eb are supposed to tend to zero.\nIn logarithmically divergent graphs the following correspondence takes place at one\nloop:\nMuv\n1\n\u2194 ln\n,\n(29)\n\u01eb\nm0\nwhere the left-hand side represents dimensional regularization, while the right-hand\nside the Pauli\u2013Villars regularization; Muv is the mass of the Pauli\u2013Villars regulator.\nNow we can pass to one-loop calculation. The relevant boson diagrams are depicted in Fig. 1. (Fermion-loop diagrams do not contribute to \u03b2 functions at the\none loop level in both, the undeformed and deformed models. We discuss them at\nthe end of this section.) For dimensional reasons we need each diagram to be at\nmost quadratic in \u2202 \u03bc \u03c60 . Higher orders in this parameter will not contribute to the\neffective action (see Eq. (25)). As a result we arrive at the following contributions\nto the effective Lagrangian:\n(a) = iG1,1 \u2202 \u03bc \u03c60 \u2202\u03bc \u03c60 IG\u22121 ,\n(b) =\n\ni\n2\n2\n{G1,0 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03bc \u03c60 + G0,1 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u20200 \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6\u20200 }IG\u22122\n2d\n\u0011\ni 1,0 0,1 \u0010\n\u03bc \u2020\n\u2212 G G\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c60 \u2202 \u03c60 I G\u22122 ,\n2\n\n(30)\n\n(31)\n\n8\nIn two-loop calculations one should also add to (26) the fermion term L\u03c8 which can be read off\nfrom Eq.

In the undeformed\nN = (2, 2) model, the relevant diagram is the T product of two fermion U(1) currents\n\u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8 (Fig. 6), which is finite due to transversality. Moreover, this remains to be the\ncase in the deformed N = (0, 2) model too - all relevant fermion diagrams have\nno ln Muv /\u03bc. A more detailed argumentation can be found in Appendix B. Thus,\nEq. (38) presents the full contribution at one loop.\n\n5\n\nZ-factors\n\nThe renormalization of the term BBA\u2020 (1 + A\u2020 A)\u22121 is determined by one-particle\nirreducible corrections to the vertex and the wave-function renormalization for \u03c8R\nand \u03b6R . Here we will deal with the corresponding Z factors, Z\u03b6 and Z\u03c8R (for brevity\nthe latter will be denoted as Z\u03c8 ).\nA closer look at the Lagrangian given in Eqs. (13) and (20), tells us that this\nB\nLagrangian is invariant under a SU(2) rotation of B and 1+A\n\u2020 A . If we define a SU(2)\nsuperfield doublet\n\u0010 \u221a2B \u0011\n(39)\n\u03a8 = g(1+A\u2020 A) ,\nB\n\nthe part that involves all right-handed fermions (i.e., all but the first terms in\nEq.

So we conclude that the wave-function\nrenormalization for \u03c8R g22\u03c72 on the one hand, and for \u03b6R on the other, must be the\nsame,\nZ\u03b6 = Z\u03c8 .\n9\n\nWe would like to comment here that this symmetry does not commute with the target space\nsymmetry, as the first component of the doublet is not invariant while the second component is.\n\n12\n\n\fIn addition to the perturbative calculation presented below, this can also be indirectly deduced from Chen's analysis [19] of the fermion zero modes in the instanton\nbackground.\nNow we are ready to carry out the actual calculation to verify the above expectation, and calculate the wave-function renormalizations for \u03c8R and \u03b6R .

The solid line with a wavy line superimposed corresponds to the\nfield \u03b6R . The fermion fields have their quantum parts and background parts marked by\nthe same lines.\nWe collect only divergent terms, where I is given in Eq. (32). One can see that \u03b6R\nand \u03c8R are corrected by \u03b3 2 in the same way. In principle we still need to collect the\ng 2 correction to \u03c8R . With the canonically normalized kinetic term such a correction\nwould be absorbed in g. With our current normalization (see Eq. (13)), it is simply\nabsent. Thus, Eq. (44) is the full result for the wave-function renormalization.\n\n6\n\nOne-loop \u03b2 function for \u03b3\n\nFrom Eq.

Here we verify this statement, by explicit one-loop calculations. The relevant\ndiagrams are shown in Fig. 3, and their contributions are listed in Table. 2. It is\nseen that the total sum of all diagrams vanishes.\nAs for O(\u03b3 2 ) correction to the BB \u0100 vertex, at one loop the would-be relevant diagrams either contain three vertices linear in \u03b3, or involve one four-fermion interaction\nwhich contributes O(\u03b3 2 ). In either case, these diagram are one-particle reducible, as\nshown in Fig. 4. So, now it is verified that Z\u03b3 = 1, and, hence,\n\u0001\n\u03b3 = 1 \u2212 i\u03b3 2 I + ig 2 I \u03b30 ,\n(47)\nimplying in turn\n\n\u03b3 2\n(\u03b3 \u2212 g 2 ) .\n(48)\n2\u03c0\nFrom symmetry arguments one should be convinced that the correction to the\nfour-fermion interaction (the second line in Eq.

(6)), it is still in the AF regime, much\nin the same way as in the undeformed N = (2, 2) model. Given the definition of the\ndeformation constant in Eq. (2), we see that of interest is the evolution law of the\nratio\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u03b3(\u03bc)\n\u03c1(\u03bc) =\n.\n(49)\ng(\u03bc)\nThis is the coupling constant in front of the four-fermion term. As we will see shortly,\nto avoid the Landau pole in the UV we must choose\n1\n.\n2\nIndeed, assembling together our results for the \u03b2g,\u03b3 functions we find\n\u03c10 = \u03c1(Muv ) \u2264 \u03c1\u2217 \u2261\n\ng2\n\u03c1(2\u03c1 \u2212 1) .\n(50)\n2\u03c0\nIf \u03c1 < \u03c1\u2217 , the \u03b2 function is negative implying the AF regime. If, on the other hand,\n\u03c1 > \u03c1\u2217 , the \u03b2 function is positive, implying the existence of the Landau pole at a\nlarge value of the normalization point. The boundary value \u03c1\u2217 = 1/2 is a fixed point.\nIf at an intermediate normalization point 11 \u03bc we choose \u03c1 < \u03c1\u2217 , it will run according\nto the AF law in UV and will tend to 1/2 in IR.\n\u03b2\u03c1 =\n\n11\n\n\u03bc cannot be too small. It must be large enough to guarantee that g 2 (\u03bc) < 1.

The dashed, dotted and solid lines correspond to the cases c < 0,\nc = 0, c > 0 respectively.\n\nActually, it is simple to find an analytic solution for \u03c1 as a function of g 2 , by\nrewriting Eq. (50) as\n\u0001\nd\u03c1\n= \u2212d ln(g 2 ) ,\n(51)\n\u03c1(2\u03c1 \u2212 1)\nwhere on the right-hand side we used Eq. (38). Eq. (51) implies\n\u03c1(g 2 ) =\n\n1\n,\n2 + gc2\n\n(52)\n\nwhere the constant c is fixed by the boundary conditions. In Fig. 5 we observe a\nuniversal IR behavior of \u03c1 approaching 1/2 from both sides. Of course, so far our\nderivation was purely perturbative, and our result was obtained at one loop, which\nformally precludes us from penetrating too far in the infrared, where the coupling g 2\nexplodes. However, later we will argue that IR the fixed point at \u03c1 = 1/2 survives\nbeyond this approximation.\nFigure 5 also exhibits the pattern of the UV behavior. If c is positive, \u03c1 is\nasymptotically free. For negative c one hits the Landau pole at a large (but finite)\nvalue of the normalization point. Below we will not consider this regime because of\n17\n\n\fits inconsistency. If we take c = 0 the value for \u03c1 freezes at \u03c1\u2217 = 1/2 in the weak\ncoupling domain, and, formally, remains at 1/2 in the strong coupling domain too.\nAs we will see later, in the heterotic CP(N \u2212 1) models with N > 2, the boundary\nvalue \u03c1 = 1/2 is a special point where a certain chiral flavor symmetry is restored.\n\n8\n\nExtension to CP(N \u2212 1) with N > 2\n\nIn this section, we will generalize our analysis to the heterotic CP(N \u2212 1) sigma\nmodel. We will show that the parameter \u03c1 does not scale with N, and for any N the\nfunction \u03b2\u03c1 is the the same as in Eq. (50) at one loop. Then we will discuss a chiral\nfermion symmetry of the \u03c8L 's sector at \u03c1 = 1/2, which will give us an argument that\n\u03b2\u03c1 is proportional to 2\u03c1 \u2212 1 in all loops.\nThe heterotic CP(N \u2212 1) Lagrangian in the geometric formulation can be borrowed from [7],\nh\ni\n\u03bc i\n\u2020j\u0304\nj\u0304 / i\nLCP(N \u22121)\n= Gij\u0304 \u2202 \u03c6 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 + i\u03c8\u0304 D\u03c8\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\ni\n\u0010\nh\n+i\u03b6R\u2020 \u2202L \u03b6R + \u03b3\u03b6R Gij\u0304 i\u2202L \u03c6\u2020j\u0304 \u03c8Ri + H.c. + \u03b3 2 \u03b6R\u2020 \u03b6R Gij\u0304 \u03c8L\u2020j\u0304 \u03c8Li\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\ng2 \u0010\n\u2020j\u0304 i\n\u2020m\u0304 k\nGij\u0304 \u03c8R \u03c8R Gkm\u0304 \u03c8L \u03c8L\n\u2212\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0011\n\u0011\u0010\n\u03b32 \u0010\ng2\n1\u22122 2\nGkm\u0304 \u03c8L\u2020m\u0304 \u03c8Rk .\nGij\u0304 \u03c8R\u2020j\u0304 \u03c8Li\n+\n2\ng\n\n(53)\n\nWe again apply the phase rotation of \u03b3 to make it real. Moreover, Gij\u0304 in Eq. (53)\nis the standard K\u00e4ler metric in the Fubini\u2013Study form. It is seen that \u03c1 = 1/2 is a\nspecial value nullifying the last line in Eq. (53).

Note that the constant c expressing the\nboundary condition in the solution Eq. (52) must be rescaled in CP(N \u2212 1), namely,\n\u03c1(g 2 ) =\n\n1\n,\n2 + Ncg2\n\n(61)\n\nNow, after we dealt with arbitrary values of N, it is time to turn to the issue\nof the chiral fermion symmetry. A quick inspection of the third and fourth lines in\nEq. (53) prompts us that their chiral structure is different. The third line is invariant\nunder independent SU(N \u2212 1) rotations of \u03c8Li and \u03c8Rj , while the fourth line is not.12\nA class of rotations we keep in mind is the SU(N \u2212 1) rotations of \u03c8L 's, with \u03c8R 's,\ni\nThe SU(N \u2212 1) rotations of \u03c8L\nof which we speak here are rather peculiar since we deal with\nthe nonflat target space. The fermions \u03c8 are defined on the tangent space, which is different for\ndifferent points on the target manifold. Therefore, the SU(N \u22121) rotations cannot be global. For all\nterms other than kinetic, this is unimportant. To properly define the chiral symmetry that leaves\nthe kinetic term of \u03c8L invariant we have to impose an additional constraint. See Appendix D for\nmore details.\n12\n\n19\n\n\f\u03b6R , and bosonic fields intact. In the geometric formulation one introduces vielbeins\nEia and rotates\nEia \u03c8Li \u2192 Uba Eib \u03c8Li\nEia \u03c8Ri \u2192 Eia \u03c8Ri ,\n(62)\n\nwhere Uba is a matrix from SU(N \u22121). A similar transformation law can be written in\nthe gauge formulation [7, 21] too.13 Note that in the CP(1) model the only possible\nchiral transformation of fermions is U(1), and it is anomalous. Hence, in fact there\nis no such symmetry. It starts from N \u2265 2 in which case the chiral transformation\nis non-Abelian and nonanomalous. Consideration of the chiral fermion symmetries\nin the heterotic CP(N \u2212 1) model was started by Tong [23].\nAt \u03c1 = 1/2 the fourth line in Eq. (53) vanishes. Other terms in the Lagrangian\nare invariant under the SU(N \u2212 1) rotations of the left-handed fermions Eq. (62).\n(For the kinetic term of \u03c8L 's see the discussion in Appendix D.)\nThus, at \u03c1 = 1/2 the symmetry of the heterotic CP(N \u2212 1) Lagrangian is enhanced. It seems likely that this enhancement (and, hence, the fixed point at \u03c1 = 1/2\nwhich goes with it) will hold to all orders in the coupling constant. Indeed, if one\nremembers about the origin of the heterotic CP(N \u2212 1) model as the world-sheet\ntheory on the strings supported in \u03bcA2 deformed N = 2 SQCD, one can try to relate\nthe above symmetry enhancement at \u03c1 = 1/2 with that in the bulk theory [23]. In\nthe limit \u03bc \u2192 \u221e the bulk theory becomes N = 1 SQCD acquiring a chiral symmetry\nabsent at finite \u03bc. Remarkably, the \u03bc \u2192 \u221e limit corresponds to \u03c1 \u2192 1/2 on the\nworld sheet [8, 9]. Thus, we expect the \u03b2 function \u03b2\u03c1 to be proportional to 2\u03c1 \u2212 1 to\nall orders. We plan to explore this issue in more detail in [17].\nNow we would like to argue that the solution Eq. (61) is, in fact, valid to all\norders in perturbation theory in the (planar) limit of large N, and so is Eq. (58)\nfor \u03b2\u03c1 . Indeed, the heterotic CP(N \u2212 1) model was solved in the large-N (planar)\nlimit [10]. The heterotic deformation parameter determining a number of physical\nquantities (e.g. the vacuum energy density) is [10]\nu=\n\n\u03c1\n;\n(1 \u2212 2\u03c1) (Ng 2 )\n\n(63)\n\nit must be renormalization-group invariant. In addition, u does not scale with N.\nSubstituting the solution Eq. (61) in Eq. (63) we indeed get\nu=\n\n1\n,\nc\n\n(64)\n\nquod erat demonstrandum. The normalization-point independence and N 0 scaling\nlaw are explicit in Eq. (64).\n13\n\nIn the notation of [21] the symmetry enhancement occurs at |\u03b3\u0303|2 = 1.\n\n20\n\n\f9\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we started the study of perturbation theory in the recently found\nN = (0, 2) CP(N \u2212 1) sigma models. We carried out explicit calculations of both\nrelevant \u03b2 functions at one loop and demonstrated that the theory is asymptotically\nfree much in the same way as the unperturbed N = (2, 2) CP(N \u22121) models provided\nthe initial condition for \u03b3 2 is chosen in a self-consistent way (i.e. c is positive). The\n\u03b2 function for the ratio \u03c1 = \u03b3 2 /g 2 exhibits an IR fixed point at \u03c1 = 1/2. Formally\nthis fixed point lies outside the validity of the one-loop approximation. We argued,\nhowever, basing on additional considerations, that the fixed point at \u03c1 = 1/2 may\nsurvive to all orders. The reason is the enhancement of symmetry (restoration of a\nchiral fermion flavor symmetry) at \u03c1 = 1/2. Moreover, we argued that Eq. (61) for\n\u03b2\u03c1 formally obtained at one loop, is in fact exact to all orders in the large-N (planar)\napproximation. Thus, in this approximation the fixed point at \u03c1 = 1/2 is firmly\nestablished.\nIn addition to the above quantitive results, we also got insights on field-theoretical\naspects of the heterotic model. Using the N = (0, 2) superfield language, we saw\nthat in CP(1) both fields \u03c8R and \u03b6R get the same renormalization at one loop level.\nThis is due to an unexpectated and unusual SU(2) symmetry between \u03c8R and \u03b6R .\nThe novelty of this symmetry is quite obvious because it mixes chiral and anti-chiral\nsuperfields, and does not commute with the target space symmetry.\n\nAcknowledgments\nXC thanks N.

Where-ever our\n21\n\n\fexpressions are dependent on the representation of Clifford algebra, we use the following convention.\n\u03b3 0 = ( 0i \u2212i\n0 ) ,\n\n\u03b3 1 = ( 0i 0i ) ,\n\n0\n).\n\u03b3 3 = \u03b3 0 \u03b3 1 = ( 10 \u22121\n\nUnder this representation Dirac fermion is expressed as\n\u0001\n\u03c8 = \u03c8\u03c8RL ,\n\n(A.1)\n\n(A.2)\n\nand we have\n\n\u2202/ =\n\n0 \u2212i\u2202R\ni\u2202L 0\n\n\u0001\n\n,\n\n(A.3)\n\nwhere \u2202R = \u2202t \u2212 \u2202z and \u2202L = \u2202t + \u2202z . The corresponding supercharges are given by\nQR = i\n\n\u2202\n\u2020\n\u2212 \u03b8R\n\u2202L ,\n\u2202\u03b8R\n\nQ\u0304R =\n\n\u2202\n\u2020\n\u2202\u03b8R\n\n+ i\u03b8R \u2202L .\n\n(A.4)\n\nApplying them to the superspace, we have the transformation rules as follow.\n\u2020\ni(QR \u01ebR + \u01edR Q\u0304R )x\u03bc = i\u01eb\u2020R \u03b8R \u2212 i\u03b8R\n\u01ebR ,\n\ni(QR \u01ebR + \u01edR Q\u0304R )\u03b8R = \u01ebR ,\n\n\u2020\ni(QR \u01ebR + \u01ed\u2020R Q\u0304R )\u03b8R\n= \u01eb\u2020R ,\n\n(A.5)\n\nwhere \u03bc \u2208 {0, 1}, \u01edR = \u2212i\u01eb\u2020R . So in fact if we define\n\u2020\n\u2020\nx\u03bcL = x\u03bc + i\u03b8R\n\u03b8R and x\u03bcR = x\u03bc \u2212 i\u03b8R\n\u03b8R ,\n\nthen we have\ni(QR \u01ebR + \u01edR Q\u0304R )x\u03bcL = 2i\u01eb\u2020R \u03b8R ,\n\n\u2020\ni(QR \u01ebR + \u01edR Q\u0304R )x\u03bcL = \u22122i\u03b8R\n\u01ebR .\n\n(A.6)\n\nNow we are ready to deduce the transformation law for the chiral superfield A\nand B.\n\u221a\n\u221a\ni(QR \u01ebR + \u01edR Q\u0304R )[\u03c6(xL ) + 2\u03b8R \u03c8L (xL )] = \u2202L \u03c62i\u01eb\u2020R \u03b8R + 2\u01ebR \u03c8L ,\n\u221a\n\u221a\ni(QR \u01ebR + \u01edR Q\u0304R )[\u03c8R (xL ) + 2\u03b8R F (xL )] = \u2202L \u03c8R 2i\u01eb\u2020R \u03b8R + 2\u01ebR F . (A.7)\nAnd this immediately leads us to Eq. (12).\nFinally, we comment that for the chiral superfield A, we have that \u2202R A is also a\nchiral superfield. This is because of the fact that [QR , \u2202R ] = [Q\u0304R , \u2202R ] = 0.\n\n22\n\n\fr+p\n\nr\n\nFigure 6: One-loop contribution by fermionic loop. The solid lines denote fermionic\npropagators, and the wave lines are bosonic background fields.\n\nAppendix B\nIn the limit of small m the one-loop fermion contribution is determined by the diagram depicted in Fig. 6. Let us start from m = 0. Then the fermion Green's function\nis\ni x\n/\nT \u03c8(x) \u03c8\u0304(0) = \u2212\n.\n(B.1)\n2\u03c0 x2\nCorrespondingly,\n\u0001 1\n1\n2 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc \u03bd\nT \u03c8\u0304(x)\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8(x) \u03c8\u0304(0)\u03b3 \u03bd \u03c8(0) =\nx\ng\n\u2212\n2x\nx\n2\u03c0 2\nx4\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni p\u03bc p\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n.\n(B.2)\n\u2192\n\u2212g\n\u03c0\np2\nThis expression is singular at p \u2192 0. However, if we keep a small IR regularizing\nmass, then it must be multiplied by a function f (p2 /m2 ) which is proportional to\np2 /m2 at small p2 . Thus the fermion loop in Fig. 6 vanishes at p \u2192 0.\n\nAppendix C\nIn order to simplify the calculation, we only collect the covariant contribution, and\ntake the target space symmetry of the theory for granted. First we calculate one-loop\ncorrection to (\u03c8\u0304\u03c8)2 . The relevant diagrams are shown in Fig. 7. Finally we have\n\u2206L(\u03c8\u0304\u03c8)2 = i\n\n2\n\u03b32 \u03b34\n(\u22121\n+\n+ )I(\u03c8\u0304\u03c8)2 .\n(1 + \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6)4\ng2 g4\n\n(C.1)\n\nIn order to see whether there are new structures, we recall that previously we\nhave\n2\u03b302\n2\n2\n(\u03c8\u03040 \u03c80 ) \u2212 4\n(\u03c8\u03040 \u03c80 )2 .\n(C.2)\nL0,(\u03c8\u0304\u03c8)2 = 2\n\u2020\n4\n\u2020\n4\ng0 (1 + \u03c6 \u03c6)\ng0 (1 + \u03c6 \u03c6)\n23\n\n\fFigure 7: One-loop corrections to (\u03c8\u0304\u03c8)2 term.\nSo if the structure remains the same after one-loop renormalization, we should have\nLeff,(\u03c8\u0304\u03c8)2 =\n\n2\u03b3 2\n2\n2\n(\n\u03c8\u0304\u03c8)\n\u2212\n(\u03c8\u0304\u03c8)2\ng 2(1 + \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6)4\ng 4(1 + \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6)4\n\n= Zg\u22121\n2 Z\u03c8\n\n2\u03b302\n2\n2\n2\n\u03b3\nZ\n(\n\u03c8\u0304\n\u03c8\n)\n\u2212\nZ\n(\u03c8\u03040 \u03c80 )2 , (C.3)\n\u03c8 4\n0 0\ng2\ng02 (1 + \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6)4\ng0 (1 + \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6)4\n\nwhere\nZg 2 =\n\ng2\n= 1 + iIg 2 ,\n2\ng0\n\nZ \u03b32 =\ng\n\n\u03b3g02\n= 1 \u2212 iI\u03b3 2 ,\n2\n\u03b30 g\n\nZ\u03c8 = 1 + iI\u03b3 2 .\n\n(C.4)\n\nThe last one is because \u03c8\u0304\u03c8 is linear in \u03c8R (or \u03c8R\u2020 ). So if we plug in Eq. (C.3) the\nknown result Eq. (C.4), we should expect that\n\u2206L(\u03c8\u0304\u03c8)2 = i\n\n2\n\u03b32 \u03b34\n(\u22121\n+\n+ )I(\u03c8\u0304\u03c8)2 .\n(1 + \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6)4\ng2 g4\n\n(C.5)\n\nAnd it is precisely the case.\nWe can also calculate one-loop correction to \u03b6R\u2020 \u03b6R \u03c8L\u2020 \u03c8L , and the relevant diagrams\nare given in Fig. 8. Finally we have\n\u2206L\u03b6 \u2020 \u03b6R \u03c8\u2020 \u03c8L\nR\n\nL\n\n\u03b32 2\n2\n(g \u2212 \u03b3 2 )I\u03b6R\u2020 \u03b6R \u03c8L\u2020 \u03c8L .\n=i\n\u2020\n2\n2\n(1 + \u03c6 \u03c6) g\n24\n\n(C.6)\n\n\fFigure 8: One-loop corrections to \u03b6R\u2020 \u03b6R \u03c8L\u2020 \u03c8L term.\nFollowing a similar analysis one can show that this is also consistent with our expectation.\n\nAppendix D\nIn this appendix we introduce vielbeins Eia , used in Sec. 8 to describe the flavor\nsymmetry of the left-handed fermions \u03c8L . The \u03c8 fermions live in the tangent space\nof the target manifold. Vielbeins make it clear that locally we could find a coordinate\nframe that is as good as the one for flat spaces. However, such choice of coordinates\nvaries from point to point, so one should expect that the fermions have nontrivial\nconnections.\nLet us look at the fermionic part of the Lagrangian, which is given by Eq. (53).\nIt is convenient to write the K\u00e4hler metric as Gj\u0304i . Then all vectors that carry the\nbarred indices must be understood as lines, and all that carry the unbarred indices\nas columns. We consider the following representation of the metric:\n\u0001a\nE \u2020 j\u0304 Ea,i = Gj\u0304i .\n(D.1)\nRising or lowering of the a index is done by the identity matrix, so we can be loose\nabout its position. The above equation does not uniquely determine the matrix E.\nRather, we start with (N \u2212 1) \u00d7 (N \u2212 1) complex matrix and impose (N \u2212 1)2 real\nconditions. The remaining freedom (the ambiguity can be represented by a constant\nU(N \u2212 1) matrix) is non-physical and one can fix the ambiguity by imposing further\ncompatible conditions. After that, we can define our \"flat\" fermions as\n\u03c8 a = Eia \u03c8 i .\n25\n\n(D.2)\n\n\fOn the other hand, in any case the kinetic term for fermions needs some adjust/ i \u2261 \u2202/\u03c8 i + \u0393ilk \u2202/\u03c6l \u03c8 k , and now, in order to require the\nments. Previously we had D\u03c8\ncovariant derivatives to be the same both before and after we apply Eq. (D.2), we\nmust have\n/ a = Eia D\u03c8\n/ i.\nD\u03c8\n(D.3)\nThese conditions determine that\nD\u03bc \u03c8 a = \u2202\u03bc \u03c8 a + \u2202\u03bc (Eia )\u03c8 i \u2212 Eia \u0393ilk \u2202\u03bc \u03c6l \u03c8 k .\n\n(D.4)\n\nGenerally speaking, it is impossible to choose the set of the vielbeins Eia to reduce\nD\u03bc \u03c8 a to \u2202\u03bc \u03c8 a . The reason is simple: the change of local coordinate frames from one\npoint on the target space to another is not trivial. In a sence, the U(N \u22121) symmetries\nin choosing Eia 's are similar to a gauge symmetry.\nThe symmetry we demonstrate here, is seen by replacing \u03c8 i 's by \u03c8 a 's. Now the\nfermion part of the Lagrangian takes the form\nLCP(N \u22121)\n\n= i\u03c8R\u2020a DL \u03c8Ra + i\u03c8L\u2020a DR \u03c8La\n\u0011\nh\n\u0010\ni\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2020\n+i\u03b6R\u2020 \u2202L \u03b6R + \u03b3\u03b6R i\u2202L \u03c6\u2020j\u0304 Ej\u0304a\n\u03c8Ra + H.c. + \u03b3 2 \u03b6R\u2020 \u03b6R \u03c8L\u2020a \u03c8La\n\ng 2 \u0010 \u2020a a \u0011 \u0010 \u2020b b \u0011\n\u03c8R \u03c8R \u03c8L \u03c8L\n\u2212\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\ng2\n\u03b3 2 \u0010 \u2020a a \u0011 \u0010 \u2020b b \u0011\n+\n1\u22122 2\n\u03c8R \u03c8L \u03c8L \u03c8R ,\n2\ng\n\n(D.5)\n\nwhere DR and DL are defined from D\u03bc in the way similar to the replacement of \u2202\u03bc\nby \u2202R and \u2202L .\nAs was emphasized before, since DL and DR do not reduce to \u2202L and \u2202R , we\ncannot yet apply the flavor rotation to \u03c8La 's: the corresponding kinetic term in the\nLagrangian will not be invariant. But it will be invariant, if we further assume that\n\u03c6's are only dependent on t + z. By doing so, DR \u2192 \u2202R , since the connection part\nis always linear in \u2202R \u03c6i 's. Now we can see that the last line in Eq. (D.5) is the only\nterm that is noninvariant under the SU(N \u2212 1) flavor rotation of \u03c8La . Needless to\nsay, the symmetry is restored when \u03c1 = 1/2.\n\n26\n\n\fReferences\n[1] A. Hanany and D. Tong, JHEP 0307, 037 (2003) [hep-th/0306150].\n[2] R. Auzzi, S. Bolognesi, J. Evslin, K.
