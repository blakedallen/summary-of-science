For the third criterion, some results suggest\nthat pinholes yield a metallic-like temperature dependence of the junction resistance8,12 . Therefore, out of the\nthree Rowell criteria, only one, the insulating-like G(T ),\nseems to be reliable.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)13 is an excellent technique for the analysis of MTJs14 since it is sensitive to the chemical species as well as to their bonding\nstate. In this letter, we show that at the usual 10\u22127 torr\nrange of base pressures in the sputtering chamber, XPS\nindicates that there exists a thin oxygen layer mostly adsorbed on the surface of the bottom electrode that yields\nthe oxidation of the first impinging atoms of the intermediate layer. We also demostrate that this is due to\nthe time elapsed between the deposition of the layers.\nTherefore, the oxidation state at the interfaces strongly\naffects the tunneling process by modifying the pinhole\nconductivity and the interface chemistry and roughness.\nThe junctions were prepared as follows8 : a dc sputtered superconducting Nb(80 nm)/Al(10 nm) bilayer bottom electrode was oxidized in air 10 minutes and a Pb top\nelectrode (200 nm) was deposited in a separate thermal\nevaporation unit, leading to the Nb/Al-AlOx /Pb junction (Pb sample). The resulting oxide thickness was typically 1-2 nm and the remaining 8 nm of metallic Al were\nsuperconducting for proximity to the Nb15 . For a second\nsample, the bottom electrode was oxidized for 18 hours\nin air (barrier thickness of 2-3 nm) and a Ni (20 nm) layer\nwas dc sputtered on top, leading to the Nb/Al-AlOx /Ni\njunction (Ni sample). The junction area for both samples\nwas 1 \u00d7 0.3 mm2 . These two samples are representative\nof the variety of samples studied8 . Standard ac (1 kHz)\ndifferential conductance G = dI/dV measurements as a\nfunction of dc bias were carried out from 4.2 to 300 K using a balanced bridge. XPS spectra (Al K\u03b1 ; base pressure\n10\u22129 torr) were recorded for exactly the same samples as\nin G(V ). The distribution of elements across the junction was studied by performing a low-energy sputtering\nprocess (4 keV, incident at 45\u25e6 ; typical etching rate 610 nm/minute) for a short time (6-18 s) and recording the\nspectrum after each step. This sputtering process, which\nmay lead to a certain intermixing, together with the fact\nthat the XPS signal averages the out-coming electrons\nfrom a region of about 5-10 nm in depth, precludes the\nobservation of sharp interfaces.\nFor the Pb junction, G(V ) at 155 K suggests tunnel\n\nWe demonstrate that at the usual 10\u22127 torr range of\nbase pressures in the sputtering chamber, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows the existence of a thin AlOx layer at\nthe Nb/Al interface in both Nb/Al-AlOx /Pb tunnel junctions\nand Nb/Al bilayers. This is due to the time elapsed between\nthe deposition of the Nb and Al bottom layers, even at times\nas short as 100 s. We also give some direct evidence of the\noxidation of the top Pb electrode on the Nb electrode surface.\nSuch oxidation probably occurs at the pinholes of the intermediate Al-AlOx layer of the junctions, as a consequence of\nthe oxidation state at the Nb/Al interface. We therefore suggest that both the base pressure and the time lapse between\nlayer depositions should be carefully controlled in magnetic\ntunnel junctions.\n75.70.-i; 73.40.Gk; 74.50.+r; 73.50.Jt; 85.30.Mn; 85.70.Kh\n\nFerromagnet/insulator/ferrromagnet\n(FM/I/FM) magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) exhibiting large magnetoresistance (MR)1 have lately attracted\nmuch interest due to their potential applications2,3 . The\nperformance of the junctions is strongly dependent on the\noxidation of the FM electrodes at the FM/I interfaces, as\nwell as on the oxidation state of the barrier, which has\nto be homogenous and complete. The use of thinner and\nthinner barriers has reopened the question of how to rule\nout the presence of pinholes. Rowell and others developed a set of criteria to ascertain that tunneling is the\ndominant mechanism in junctions with at least one superconducting (S) electrode4 . Three of these criteria still\napply in FM/I/FM structures: (i) an exponential insulator thickness dependence of the conductance, G; (ii) a\nparabolic voltage dependence of G that can be fitted to\nthe theoretical models5,6 ; and (iii) a weak insulating-like\ndependence G(T ).\nFor the first criterion, it has been shown7 that pinholes may mimic the exponential thickness dependence\nof the tunneling resistance. For the second one, some of\nus demonstrated8 that S/I/FM junctions that displayed\nparabolic G(V ) curves in the normal state, showed, at\nlow temperatures and depending on the oxidation procedure, either tunneling or pinhole conduction (Andreev\nreflection9 ). The recent observation of very large MR\nin Co-Co and Ni-Ni wire nanocontacts10 also suggests\nthe pinhole contribution to TMR in MTJs. Given the\nratio of the conduction between metallic contacts and\njunctions11 , pinhole regions of one part in 106 must be\n1\n\n\fG(V) / G(V=0.012V)\n\n0.0220\n\n-1\n\ndI/dV (\u03a9 )\n\n155 K\n0.0215\n\n0.0210\n\nFig. 1(b) shows the atomic concentration of Nb, Pb,\nAlOx and O obtained from the XPS intensities13 for the\nPb sample, as a function of the sputtering time (sputtering steps of 18 s). The AlOx concentration was obtained\nby fitting the intensity of the Al 2p core level to both a\nmetallic and oxide contribution13 . As soon as Nb is detected, the O signal increases, first reaching a maximum\nand later decreasing as the sputtering process approaches\nthe Nb layer. The AlOx concentration perfectly follows\nthat of O (Fig. 1(b)), the first maximum corresponding\nto the insulating barrier, the second one (ca. 300 s) suggesting that there is a thin oxygen layer on top of Nb\nthat oxidizes the first Al atoms arriving at the bottom\nelectrode. At short sputtering times, the oxidation of\nboth the free surface of the sample (O-Pb 1s at 528.3529.4 eV) and the barrier (O-Al 1s at 531-531.5 eV) are\nobserved. Besides, the O-Al 1s peaks at the Nb/Al interface are clearly asymmetric at low energies, and a small\npeak at about 529.3 eV is observed (Fig. 1(c)), suggesting\nan O-Pb contribution of about 3%. This indicates that\nsome PbOx is present on the Nb surface, which is probably due both to the existence of the oxygen layer at the\nNb/Al interface and to the consequent Pb oxidation at\nthe pinholes of the Al-AlOx layer. This is in agreement\nwith some electron microscopy studies showing a pinhole\nsurface area up to about 2% in AlOx barriers18 , even if\nin the present Pb junction, the former Al layer was about\n10 nm in thickness. From the Nb 3d core level (Fig. 1(d)),\nsome NbO (Nb-O 3d5/2 at 204.6 eV) on the surface of the\nNb layer is inferred, although the calculated O-Nb contribution is at least one order of magnitude smaller than\nthe experimental O-Al one, so that the former (530.0530.4 eV) is not detected since it overlaps to the latter.\nThe Pb 4f core level (not shown) at the Nb/Al interface\nalso yields a small amount of PbO and/or Pb3 O4 , while\nthe O-Pb/Pb-O ratio is about 1.5. The Ni sample also\nfollows this framework: both the O-Al 1s and Al-O 2p\nsignals increase on the surface of Nb.\nGiven the base pressures in the sputtering chamber\n(2.6 \u00d7 10\u22127 and 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22127 torr for the Pb and Ni samples, respectively), the thin oxygen layer at the Nb/Al\ninterface is related to the time that the Nb film is kept\nin the chamber before the Al deposition proceeds (45\nminutes and 5 hours for the Pb and Ni junctions, respectively). Three Nb(100 nm)/Al(20 nm) bilayers were\nprepared to support this suggestion: sample Nb/Al-1, for\nwhich the Nb layer was 100 s in chamber (base pressure of\n1.4 \u00d7 10\u22127 torr); sample Nb/Al-2, for which the Nb layer\nwas 18.5 hours in the chamber (1.2 \u00d7 10\u22127 torr); and\nsample Nb/Al-3, for which the Nb layer was 27 hours in\nair (former base pressure of 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22127 torr). The role of\nthe standard Gibbs energy of formation of the metal oxides (\u2206f G0 at 298.15 K)19 was studied by preparing two\nNb(100 nm)/Pb(200 nm) bilayers with increasing transfer time in air from the sputtering chamber to the Pb\nevaporation unit; sample Nb/Pb-1 was 7 minutes in air,\nwhile sample Nb/Pb-2, was 24 hours.\nThe atomic concentration for Nb, metallic Al, O and\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n4.2 K\n-0.01 0\n0.01\nBias (V)\n\n0.0205\n\n(a)\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nBias (V)\nAtomic concentration (%)\n\n80\n\n(b)\nNb\n\n60\n\n40\n\nPb\n\nO\n\n20\n\nAlOx\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\nSputtering time (s)\n9000\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nIntensity (c/s)\n\n8000\n\n3d5/2\n\nO-Al\n3d3/2\n\n7000\n\nNb\n\nO 1s\nO-Pb\n\n6000\n\n5000\n\nNbOx\n540\n\n535\n\n530\n\n525\n\n210\n\n205\n\n200\n\nBinding Energy (eV)\n\nFIG. 1.

The fit of G(V ) to the Brinkman-DynesRowell (BDR) model5 yields a barrier thickness of 1.1 nm\nand heights of 3.6 eV and 2.4 eV on the Pb and Nb/Al\nsides, respectively, while the fit to the Simmons' model6\nyields 1.2 nm and 2.9 eV. For the Ni sample, G is high\nand flat, indicating big metal-to-metal shorts. This suggests that Pb mostly adds to the AlOx barrier without\ndamaging it and that the latter is free of metal-to-metal\npinholes. However, Ni damages the barrier, in agreement\nwith previous studies of the influence of the top electrode\non the junction properties: both the junction resistance16\nand the barrier height17 increase with the ionic radius\n(from Ni to Pb) since the larger the latter is, the less\nthe element can penetrate in the barrier, resulting in less\neffective micro-shorts.\n2\n\n\f80\n\n(a)\n\nAl\n\nnel junctions at the usual 10\u22127 torr base pressures, the\noxidation state at the interfaces depends on the time\nelapsed between the deposition of the layers, even at\ntimes as short as 100 s, which is most relevant for the\nperformance of the junctions. We therefore suggest that\nboth parameters should be carefully controlled. We have\nalso given some direct evidence of the oxidation of the top\nelectrode on the surface of the bottom one, probably at\nthe pinholes of the intermediate layer -even if the latter\nis about 10 nm in thickness- and due to the oxidation\nstate at the interfaces. As some junctions studied show\ntunnel conduction, the oxidation state at the interfaces\nmay be relevant to the dominant conduction mechanism.\nConsequently, the oxidation of the top FM layer at the\npinholes of the insulating barrier in MTJs may well be\ninfluenced by the synthesis conditions so that the role of\nthe latter in the quality of the junctions should be taken\ninto account, the relative metal oxide formation energy\nof the selected elements being crucial.\nFinancial support of the Spanish CICYT (MAT20000858) and the Generalitat de Catalunya (ACI2000-04 and\n2000SGR-025) are gratefully recognized.

Even for sample Nb/Al-1 (Fig. 2(a)), there\nis change in the slope of both the concentrations of AlOx\nand O as the Nb layer is detected. The O 1s core level\nyields mostly O-Al bonds and, although there might be\nsome NbO on the surface of the Nb, the calculated ONb contribution is at least about one order of magnitude\nsmaller than the O-Al one for all samples, in agreement\nwith \u2206f G0 (Al2 O3 )= -1582.3 kJ/mol and \u2206f G0 (NbO)= 378.6 kJ/mol19 . A similar picture is drawn for the Nb/Pb\nsamples (not shown), the main differences being that,\nwhile at the free surface of the samples the oxidation\nstate corresponds to O-Pb, in agreement with the Pb-O\ncontribution to the Pb 4f core level, the O 1s increase at\nthe Nb/Pb interface takes place at 530.0-530.4 eV, suggesting that this is the core level energy for the O-Nb 1s\nbonds. Both the Nb-O peak position and the O-Nb/NbO ratio at the Nb/Pb interfaces, suggest NbO2 . Besides,\nthe calculated O-Pb contribution is about two orders\nof magnitude smaller than the O-Nb one, in agreement\nwith \u2206f G0 (NbO2 )= -740.5 kJ/mol and \u2206f G0 (PbO)= 187.9 kJ/mol19 .\nIn conclusion, we have shown that when preparing tun3\n\n\f14\n\nS.R.
