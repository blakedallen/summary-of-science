For the first time transcendental equations are received, one of the solutions of which corresponds to the value of the magnetic charge by Dirack, or to\nthe constant of fine structure.\nMinkowski's work [1] for the first time led the solution of physical problems\nto geometrical problems.\n1. Such physical theorem as kinematics and theory of inertial systems is\nobtained on the basis of flat space through equation\nRiklm = 0\n\n(1)\n\nfor three-dimensional Euclidean as well as for four-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean\nspaces.\n2.\n1\n(2)\nGik = Rik \u2212 Rgik\n2\nis presented as an object of four-dimensional pseudo-Rimman geometry (Einstein) and is determined by formula\nK=\n\nGik \u03be i \u03be k\n\u03bei\u03be i\n\n(3)\n\nwhere K is the mean scalar crookedness of three-dimensional subspace, which\nis orthogonal to an arbitrarily determined vector \u03be i . Tensor Gik is called the\nconservative tensor of Gilbert-Einstein and plays a fundamental role in the structure of the field equation of the General Theory of Relativity (GTR).\nLet us discuss formula\nGik = 0\n1 e-mail:\n\ndealing51@hotmail.com\n\n1\n\n(4)\n\n\fEinstein [2] predicted that this equation might be a basis for a more general\nphysical theory in case it described electromagnetic fields along with gravitational fields. It is true that this equation is insufficient for describing all physical\nfields. It describes only gravitational fields outside of the source. From the point\nof view of geometry this equation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for\nflat space.\nFor a precise description of the flat space along with equation (4) we will\ntry to introduce one more geometric equation. The starting point of the unified\nfield theory2 is the fact that equation (4) alone is insufficient for describing all\nphenomena. Therefore the problem of finding a mathematical object occurs\nwhich, after being added to Gik , will allow to obtain the structure of space\ndescribing the physical situation completely.\nGravitation can be described either by introducing the gravitational field into\nthe flat space, or by discussing a geometrical object in crooked four-dimensional\nspace without the gravitational field. The last simulation is the geometric interpretation of gravitation. Hence if the deformation, which creates crookedness is\nexcluded, we will obtain the flat space.\nMathematical Part\nLet us introduce tensor Gik , Pik in the following way:\nGik +\n\n(\u03b7 ik \u2212 gik )\n= Pik\n\u03be i\u03bei\n\nGik \u2212\n\n(\u03b7 ik \u2212 gik )\n= Pik\n\u03be i\u03bei\n\n(5)\n\nGik is the counter-tensor of Gik , which describes the counter-space in relation to space determined by Gik . \u03b7 ik , gik are metric tensors of flat and crooked\nspaces respectively, and \u03be i is the vector determined initially.\nGeometrically (5) means that two spaces of Einstein G and G are called\nmutually counter if the following is realized: In each point of space the ratio\nof mean scalar crookednesses of the three-dimensional subspace orthogonal to\ninitially determined vector \u03be i depends on the module of that vector only. Both\nspaces have a common coordination.\nK\nei ei\n= i\nK\n\u03be \u03bei\n\n(6)\n\nwhere ei is the unit vector of vector \u03be i.\nThe mean scalar crookedness of the three-dimensional subspace is determined by formula (3) and therefore (6) is written as\n\u03be i \u03be i Gik \u03be i \u03be k = ei ei Gik \u03be i \u03be k\nHence we can determine\n2 Inert\n\nfield is included with the fieled of gravitation\n\n2\n\n(7)\n\n\fGik \u2212 2\n\nGik +\n\ngik\n\u03b7\n= Gik \u2212 2 iik\ni\n\u03be \u03bei\n\u03be \u03bei\n\n(\u03b7 \u2212 gik )\n(\u03b7 ik \u2212 gik )\n= Gik \u2212 ik i\ni\n\u03be \u03bei\n\u03be \u03bei\n\n(8)\n\nn\n\nLet us introduce operator (\u2212) which transforms space into counter-space,\ntensor Gik into tensor Gik , and the sign is changed into the opposite one. Even\ntimes of counter-operating transforms the space into itself, and odd times of\ncounter-operating transforms the space into the counter-space. If the left side is\nnoted as tensor Pik and the right side is noted as counter-tensor (\u22121) Pik , then\nequation (8) can be written as\nPik = (\u22121) Pik\n\n(9)\n\nTheorem 1\nFor the space to be flat it is necessary and sufficient that tensor Gik and\ncounter-tensor Gik be equal.\nProof - necessity: From equation system (5) we receive\nGik \u2212 Gik \u2212 2\n\n(\u03b7 ik \u2212 gik )\n=0\n\u03bei\u03bei\n\n(10)\n\nSufficiency: If Gik \u2212 Gik = 0 is a flat space and vice versa \u03b7 ik \u2212 gik = 0,\nthen Gik = Gik . Theorem proved.\nFrom system (5) follows equation\nGik + Gik = 2Pik\n\n(11)\n\nIf Gik = 0, then we receive the already familiar structure of Einstein equation\n[3], only if we substitute 2Pik by tensor of energy of impulse and tension.\nTheorem 2\nFor the space to be flat, it is necessary and sufficient that Pik = 0.\nEquation (5) is written as\nGik +\n\n(\u03b7 ik \u2212 gik )\n=0\n\u03bei\u03bei\n\n(12)\n\nBased on the example of spherical symmetry, equation (12) has a flat solution\n(metrics of Minkowski).\nConsequence: For flat space we have\nGik \u2212 Gik = 0\nGik + Gik = 0\n\n3\n\n\fHence, for the space to be flat, it is necessary and sufficient that\nGik = 0, Gik = 0\n\n(13)\n\nor that space and counter-space coincide and be equal to zero.\nThus the condition of sufficiency of Gik = 0 is added to the condition of\nnecessity of flat space Gik = 0.\nIf we look at equation (11) from the mathematical point of view, then tensor\n2Pik is a source of crookedness or a source of deformation.\nHowever!.. Expression (10) can be decomposed by two menas into two equivalent equations:\nGik = 2\n\nGik = \u22122\n\n(\u03b7 ik \u2212 gik )\n\u03bei\u03bei\n\n(\u03b7 ik \u2212 gik )\n\u03bei\u03bei\n\nGik = 0\n\n(a)\n\n(first way)\n\nGik = 0\n\n(b)\n\n(second way)\n\n(14)\n\nPhysical Part\nThe first pair of equations (14,a) describes the internal problem of gravitation, or the external problem of inertia, and the second pair of equations\n(14,b) - vice versa. Based on the above, the full problem of gravitation can be\nformulated:\nGik = 0\n\nGik = 2\n\n(\u03b7 ik \u2212 gik )\n\u03bei\u03bei\n\n(15)\n\nwhere the first equation is the external problem, and the second equation is\nthe internal problem. In the right side of the second equation of system (15), the\n(\u03b7 \u2212 gik )\n-a\ntensor of energy, impulse and tension is substituted by Tik = 2 ik i\n\u03be \u03bei\ntensor of geometric origin (magnitude of deformation of space). The solution of\nsystem (15) will be searched for spherical symmetry or for a centrally symmetric\nfield.\nThe solution of the first equation (15) is the famous solution of Schwarzschild\n[4] and is expressed by metrics:\n\u0010\n\u0001\nrgr \u0011 2 2\ndr2\nds2 = 1 \u2212\nc dt \u2212 r2 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 + d\u03b8 2 \u2212\nr\n1 \u2212 rgr /r\n\n(16)\n\nand the second equation of system (15), which describes gravitational filed\ninside the source, is expressed by the system of equations (is calculated by\ncomponents of the tensor):\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n\u2202\u03bb 1\n\u2212 2 \u2212 2 =0\nexp (\u2212\u03bb)\n\u2202r r\nr\nr\n4\n\n\f\u2202\u03bb\n=0\n\u2202t\n\n(17)\n\nwhere\ng00 = exp (\u2212\u03bb)\ng33 = exp (\u03bb)\nthe solution of which is presented by metrics\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0001\ndr2\nr\n2\nc2 dt2 \u2212 r2 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 + d\u03b82 \u2212\nds = 1 \u2212\nrk\n1 \u2212 r/rk\n\n(18)\n\nFor small distances it becomes the metrics of usual pseudo-Euclidean geometry. Another constant is determined from the condition of coincidence on\nthe border of the internal and the external solutions. If in the solution of\nSchwarzschild that constant is expressed as gravitational radius and is a geometrical measure of the active gravitational mass, then for (18) that constant\nrepresents the inert radius and expresses the geometrical measure of the active\ninert mass. From the condition of coincidence on the border of the internal and\nthe external solutions, we have\n1\u2212\n\nr\nrgr\n= 1 \u2212 , or\nr\nrk\n\nrgr rk = r2 = r02 ,\n\nGmgr\nrk = r02\nc\n\nIf constant r0 is the Plank distance (expressed through natural constants),\nthen for rk we receive expression\nrk =\n\nh\nmc\n\nMass is introduced into physics with different notions: First as inert resistance, inert passive mass mP I , and secondly, as a constant of association which\nshows how strongly the gravitational field \u03c6 affects the body. This is a constant\nof association, which is the passive gravitational mass mP G (as the mass of a\ntest body). And finally, the third notion is the active gravitational mass mAG ,\nas gravitational charge or as intensity of the source of gravitational field. The\nfirst two notions are included in the equation of motion:\nmP I\n\nd\u03c6\nd2 xi\n= mP G i\ndt2\ndx\n\nThe third notion is included in the gravitational potential. The principle of\nequivalence assumes the universal law\nmin = mgr,\n\nmP I = mP G\n\n5\n\n(c)\n\n\fNote that in formulas where metric coefficients represent potentials of specific\nforce fields, gravitational radius is included, which is determined by the active\ngravitational mass (mAG ). In the solution of Schwarzschild these are potentials\nof gravitational filed. Metrical coefficients of the counter-space are interpreted\nas potentials of the inert field.\nMass mAI , included in the Compton radius, is the fourth notion of mass. It\nis the center of dispersion of light and is included in the structure of metrical\ntensor of the counter-space g ik . The fourth notion of mass is presented as the\nactive inert mass. This was noted by Siama. [5].\nThe equality between the active gravitational and the active inert masses,\nwhich are present in formulas (16) and (18) respectively, is formulated as the\nactive principle of equivalence.\nmgr = min\n1/2\n\n(Gh)\nand as a consequence r0 =\nis the formula expressing the fundamenc3\ntal meaning of length, only if rgr = rin = r0 .\nFrom the condition of coincidence on the border of the internal and the\nexternal solutions, (16) and (18) coincide in point r0 and are expressed as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0001\ndr2\nm\nc2 dt2 \u2212 r2 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 + d\u03b8 2 \u2212\n(19)\nds2 = 1 \u2212\nm0\n1 \u2212 m/m0\n\u0012 \u00131/2\nhc\nis the fundamental meaning of mass.\nwhere m0 =\nG\nThus if the metrics of Schwarzschild describes the external gravitational filed\nwith source rgr , then metrics (18) describes the external inert filed with source\nrk .\nGravitational and inert fields are linked through the active principle of equivalence in the counter-projection. Let us consider particular cases.\n1. Approximation of a weak field\nThe expression of component g00 of the metric tensor\ng00 = 1 \u2212\n\nr\nrk\n\ndescribes the potential of the filed, and the force is determined by formula\nF = mc2\n\ndg00\n,\ndr\n\nF =\n\nmc2\nM mc3 ~r0\n=\nh/M c\nh |r0 |\n\n(20)\n\nwhere M is the active inert mass, m is the mass of the test body, and ~r0 is\nthe unit vector. In formula (20) force F does not depend on the distance, which\nmeans that in the formation of that force all components and fragments of the\nUniverse participate equally. And if the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic\nthen due to M = 0 (effective mass), this force F = 0. Newton's first law is\nobtained - the theory of inertial systems. By the way, in this approximation\nfrom Schwarzschild's solution the Law of Terrestrial Gravitation is obtained.\n6\n\n\fThe forces of inertia are so usual that it is very uncommon to think about\nsuch a problem. Despite this, a lot has been written and spoken about this. Here\nwe would like to discuss sources of inertial forces. According to Newton [6], the\nsource of inertial forces is the absolute space. This means that the absolute space\ncan influence matter, and the opposite influence form the matter is excluded.\nThus, the interaction between the absolute space and material bodies does not\nexist. This rather abstract point of view corresponds to the interpretation of\nphysical interactions on the basis of the field theory. Therefore, a result of\nthe proposed theory is that forces of inertia impacting on the body depend on\nphysical qualities of space and all members filling the space.\nBasically, Mach's principle is formulated: Inert qualities of an object are\ndetermined by distribution of mass-energy in the whole space. On the basis of\nMach's principle and the active principle of equivalence, as well as on the basis\nof Rimman's idea on geometry of space corresponding to physics and playing\nan essential role in it, we were able to build this theory.\nRotation of a body relative to the system of static stars is equivalent to the\nrotation of stars around the body. In both cases the relative motion is the same.\nThis is relativity according to Mach and Berkley.\nLet us imagine a body located inside of a massive sphere filled with members\nof Metagalaxy. If the body suddenly gets acceleration, then such acceleration\nwill be similar to the acceleration of the whole Universe relative to the body. In\nthis process all members of the Universe participate equally regardless of their\ndistance. If the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic, then such acceleration\nfor the body means distortion of local isotropness (rotation) or local homogeneity (uniform motion). Forces of inertia occur. Mach proposed a viewpoint\nsimilar to this ideology. A system is examined in the Universe [7], in which a\nbig amount of matter exists on far distances.\nCentrifugal forces occur due to real rotation around a real rotation axis, and\nthus the local isotropness is distorted in the system of the Universe. Forces of\nCoriolis occurring in a rotating system of coordinates are real forces and are\ncreated by the rotation of the whole Universe around the considered body.\n2. Let us discuss a particular case when the metrics is given on a threedimensional sphere and is determined by formula:\nds2 = r2 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 + d\u03b82\n\n\u0001\n\n(21)\n\nThat is equivalent to the motion of a three-dimensional spherical surface in\nthe radial direction in the four-dimensional pseudo-Rimman space (18).\n\u0012\n\u0013\nr\ndr2\n1\u2212\nc2 dt2 \u2212\n=0\nrk\n1 \u2212 r/rk\nor\nr = rk (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8) ,\n\nr=\n\n7\n\nh\n(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8)\nmc\n\n(22)\n\n\fCompton's formula is received for dispersion of light on charged particles if\nv\nh\n= cos \u03b8, rk =\nare the Compton or inertial radiuses. In Schwarzschild's soc\nmc\nlution this particular case brings us to Einstein's formula [8], which was obtained\nbefore the creation of GTR.\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2GM\n(23)\nc = c0 1 \u2212 2\nc r\nThe observed Compton effect on charged particles is an expression of the\nactive inert mass. For big m this effect is not observed due to its small value.\nIn the metrics of Schwarzschild when r \u2192 rgr all processes on the body in relation to the external observer are \"frozen\", and a collapse occurs which creates\na frozen body, which does not send any signals to the surrounding environment\nand interacts with the external world only through its static gravitational field.\nSuch a formation is called a gravitational black hall, or a gravitational collapse.\nIn metrics (18) when r \u2192 rk , all processes on the body in relation to the\ninternal observer are frozen. A frozen inert black hall is formed, which interacts\nonly through its inert filed. The source of the inert field is the equivalent mass\nof energy of gravitational field. Analogously, the source of the gravitational field\nis the equivalent mass of energy of the inert field.\nSuppose r \u2192 rgr , rk , then the body will be within gravitational as well as\n\u00131/2\n\u0012\nGM\n,\nwithin inertial radiuses. Such situation will occur only in point r0 =\nc3\nwhich is determined by the Plank distance. This point r0 in the metrics of\nthe four-dimensional pseudo-Rimman space seems to us to be an absolute and\nspecial point. A body determined in such a way may be considered both blind\nand deaf.\nIf gravitational and inert fields are created by spherical bodies, then their\nfull mass is expressed as\nZ\n4\u03c0\nm= 3\nP00 r2 dr\n(24)\nc\nFor the gravitational field the tensor is determined by component\nP00 =\n\n2r0\nr3\n\n(25)\n\n2\nrr0\n\n(26)\n\nand for the field of inertia\n0\n\nP0 =\n\ndetermining the limits of integration. The dead particle with radius r0 =\n\u00131/2\nGM\nand mass does not create any excitation in the space. The latter\nc3\nremains relativistically flat, although the space is like being filled up with dead\nmass (blind and deaf particles).\n\n\u0012\n\n8\n\n\fSuch virtual particles are foundations, on which real particles are born by\nlocalizing equivalent energy in the given volume of space through exciting it.\nThat is why it is assumed that during formation of the particle the limits of\nintegration are changed from 1 to r on the one side, and from 1 to 1/r on the\nother.
