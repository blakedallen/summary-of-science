These new length spectra are shown to converge in the\nsense that limi\u2192\u221e L1/k (Mi ) \u2282 {0} \u222a L1/k (M ) as Mi \u2192 M in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. Energy\nmethods are introduced to estimate the shortest element of L1/k , as well as a concept called the\nminimizing index which may be used to estimate the length of the shortest closed geodesic of a\nsimply connected manifold in any dimension. A number of gap theorems are proven, including one\nfor manifolds, M n , with Ricci \u2265 (n \u2212 1) and volume close to V ol(S n ). Many results in this paper\nhold on compact length spaces in addition to Riemannian manifolds.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nRecall that a compact length space is a metric space such that every pair of points is joined by\na length minimizing rectifiable curve whose length is the distance between the two points. The\nsimplest example of such a space is a Riemannian manifold. A \"geodesic\" in such a space is a locally\nlength minimizing curve.\nA closed geodesic is a map \u03b3 : S 1 \u2192 M which is locally minimizing around every point in S 1 .\nThis extends the concept of a smoothly closed geodesic in a manifold. (c.f. [BBI]SoWei) We shall\nassume throughout that all geodesics are parametrized proportional to arclength with speed L/(2\u03c0).\nThe length spectrum, L(M ), of a length space, M , is the set of lengths of closed geodesics. These\ndefinitions are just extensions of the clasical definitions on Riemannian manifolds.\nThe length spectrum is not continuous with respect to deformations of the manifold. When a\nsequence of spaces, Mi , converges in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense [Defn 2.2] to a space, M , it may\nhave closed geodesics \u03b3i converging to a curve which is not a closed geodesic. That is, there could\nbe a \"disappearing length\": \u2203L0 = limi\u2192\u221e Li \u2208 L(Mi ) such that L0 \u2208\n/ L(M ).\n\nFigure 1: Mi \u2192 Y in the Gromov Hausdorff sense but a length disappears.\nIn particular, we have this situation in Figure 1. Here the sequence of surfaces, Mi , with in\u2217 Partially\n\nsupported by NSF Grant # DMS-0102279 and a PSC CUNY Award\n\n1\n\n\fcreasingly small pairs of handles converges in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense to a standard sphere, Y .\nNotice how the closed geodesics which pass through both handles converge to a geodesic segment\nbut not to a closed geodesic. The lengths, Li , of these closed geodesics converge to L0 = \u03c0/3 which\nis not in the length spectrum of the sphere. In fact the shortest closed geodesic in S 2 has length 2\u03c0.\nFor details see Example 2.2.\nIn Example 2.1, we will examine the length spectrum of a flat torus created by taking the\nisometric product of a circle with a small circle. As the smaller circle's diameter approaches 0,\nwe say the sequence of tori \"collapses\" in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense to a circle, S 1 . The length\nspectrum of the limit space, S 1 , is just {n\u03c0 : n \u2208 N}, yet the length spectra of the collapsing tori is\nbecoming an increasingly dense collection of points in [0, \u221e). Thus we have quite a large collection\nof disappearing lengths!\nBoth of these examples will be described in full detail in the first section [Example 2.1] and\n[Example 2.2], after we have given the rigourous definition of Gromov-Hausdorff convergence.\nIt is also possible that there is a \"suddenly appearing length\": L0 \u2208 L(M ) such that no sequence\nLi \u2208 L(Mi ) converges to L. This occurs even when Mi converges to M in the C 4 sense as can be\nseen in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2: The geodesic in Y is suddenly appearing as a limit of the Mi but not as a limit of the Ni .\nIn this paper, we define a new collection length spectra, L1/k (M ), [Defn 3.2] such that\n[\n\nk\u2208\n\nL1/k (M ) = L(M ) [Theorem 3.1].\n\n(1.1)\n\nN\n\nWhile any collection of length spectra satisfying (1.1) would have to incoporate the sudden appearances observed in Figure 2, we do prove in Theorem 7.1 that\nlim L1/k (Mi ) \u2282 {0} \u222a L(M ),\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhen Mi converge to M in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense.\nThroughout the paper we survey past results and techniques used to study the length spectrum,\nwe relate them to the new 1/k length spectra and we suggest new directions of research. As many\nof the proposed problems in this paper are at a level a graduate student should be able to handle,\nwe have presented this paper in a manner that should easily be read by a student.\nIn Section 2 we give the necessary background on Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, completely\ndescribing how the spheres with tiny handles and the collapsing tori converge [Examples 2.2 and 2.1].\nWe also present ellipsoids which converge to a singular doubled disk Example 2.3. Readers who are\njust interested in the 1/k length spectra and not their convergence properties may skip Section 2\nand easily read everything except Sections 7.1 and 8.\n2\n\n\fIn Section 3, we introduce 1/k geodesics, which are geodesics that minimize on any subsegment\nwhose length is 1/k of the total length [Defn 3.1]. The set of lengths of such geodesics is L1/k\n[Defn 3.2] and we prove Theorem 3.1. We also relate L1/k (M ) to the diameter and injectivity radius\nof the space [Lemma 3.2 and Lemma 3.3]. Using these results we descibe the 1/k length spectra of\na sphere and collapsing tori [Examples 3.1 and 3.2].\nIn Section 3 we also complete a study of closed geodesics. We define the minimizing index of a\ngeodesic as the smallest k which can be used to classify it as a 1/k geodesic [Defn 3.3]. Then we define\nthe injectivity radius of a geodesic [Defn 3.4] and relate it to the minimizing index [Lemma 3.4]. We\ndiscuss iterated geodesics [Lemma 3.5] and a particularly illustrative example of the equator of an\nellipsoid close to a doubled disk [Example 3.3].\nIn Section 4 we prove that the covering spectrum defined in [SoWei] is a subset of L1/2 [Theorem 4.1]. Recall that in [SoWei], the CovSpec(M ) \u222a {0} was proven to be continuous with respect\nto Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of the manifold. In other words, there is no sudden appearance\nof elements in the Covering Spectrum as described in Figure 2. We could not expect to prove such\na strong theorem for L1/k (M ) because we include all lengths of L(M ) in one of the them [Theorem 3.1]. In fact the suddenly appearing geodesic in Figure 2 is a 1/2 geodesic and an element of\nL1/2 . This justifies the lack of an equality in Theorem 7.1.\nIn Section 5 we turn to a study of the systole of a manifold. Since the systole is the length of\nthe shortest noncontractible curve it is an element of L1/2 [Lemma 4.1]. We survey past estimates\nrelating the systole to the volume and diameter of a manifold and extend them to estimates on\nmin L1/2 . It should be noted that some of these estimates are only achieved on singular manifolds,\nso the extension of all concepts to compact length spaces in this paper is further justified.\nIn Section 6 we estimate the length of the shortest closed geodesic in a compact length space,\nmin L(M ). First we define the minimizing index, minind(M ), of a space and then prove that\nmin L(M ) \u2264 minind(M )diam(M ) [Defn 6.1 and Theorem 6.1]. We also provide a lower bound on\nmin L(M ) [Theorem 6.2]. We close with an application of an old result of Klingenberg to show that\nthe minimizing index of a manifold without conjugate points is 1/2 [Corollary 6.3].\nIn Section 7, we finally prove the convergence theorem mentioned above. We conclude that if\nthere is a sequence of spaces with a disappearing length in the limit, as in Figure 1, then the geodesics\nthat disappear must have minimizing index diverging to infinity [Corollary 7.2]. Theorem 7.1 also\nimmediately implies that L1/k (M ) \u222a {0} is compact [Corollary 7.3]. We discuss the convergence\nof L1/k (Mi ) for the collapsing tori, the flattening ellipsoids and a new example converging to a\nhexagonal region [Examples 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3]. We remark on Bangert's Theorem [Remark 7.4].\nIn Section 8 we rephrase Theorem 7.1 as a gap thoerem [Theorem 8.1] and then prove a number\nof gap theorems. For example, we use Colding's sphere stability theorem to prove:\n+\n\nTheorem 1.1 There exists a function \u03a8 : R \u00d7 N \u00d7 N \u2192 R\nthat if N n is a compact Riemannian manifold with\n\n+\n\nsuch that lim\u03b4\u21920 \u03a8(\u03b4, k, n) = 0 such\n\nV ol(N n ) \u2265 V ol(S n ) \u2212 \u03b4\n\n(1.3)\n\nL1/(2k) (M n ) \u2282 [0, \u01ebk ) \u222a (2\u03c0 \u2212 \u01ebk , 2\u03c0 + \u01ebk ) \u222a * * * (2k\u03c0 \u2212 \u01ebk , 2k\u03c0 + \u01ebk )\n\n(1.4)\n\nand Ricci(N n ) \u2265 (n \u2212 1) then\n\nfor \u01ebk = \u03a8(\u03b4, k, n).\nIn light of Example 8.1, we propose that the length spectra on these manifolds do not converge\n[Problem 11.22. We obtain similar results for Riemannian manifolds with Ricci \u2265 (n \u2212 1) and\nrad(M n ) close to rad(S n ) and for M n with first Betti number equal to n \u2212 1 and Ricci curvature\nthat is almost nonnegative [Theorems 8.3 and 8.4]. Similar gap theorems also exist for M n which\nare almost isotopic and have a uniform lower bound on their Ricci curvature [Remark 8.8].\n3\n\n\fIn Section 9, we introduce openly 1/k geodesics which are shown to be uniquely defined on\nRiemannian manifolds by any collection of evenly spaced points [Defn 9.1 and Lemma 9.1]. We then\ndefine the openly 1/k length spectra and extend most of the results and definitions of the previous\nsections to this setting. There are no openly 1/2 geodesics [Lemma 9.2], so the results in Sections 4\nand 5 do not apply. Theorem 7.1 doesn't extend well either due to the open nature of the Defn 9.1\n[Theorem 9.2 and Example 9.3]. Otherwise the results carry over. We close with a discussion of the\nborderline case of a 1/k geodesic which is not an openly 1/k geodesic on manifolds.\nSection 10 extends the theory of geodesics on as critical points of the energy function on the\nloop space to openly 1/k geodesics. First we review the piecewise geodesic version of the theory and\nthen prove Theorem 10.2 which identifies openly 1/k geodesics on a convex compact Riemannian\nmanifold with boundary with \"rotating\" smooth critical points of a uniform energy function on\nk-fold product, (M )k , of the space. We explicitly demonstrate a few examples and then discuss why\nthis thoery does not extend well to 1/k geodesics and nonsmooth spaces. Nevertheless it can be\nused to estimate the minimizing index of a Riemannian manifold and to determine whether a convex\nRiemannian manifold with boundary has any closed geodesics.\nSection 11 concludes the paper with a list of open problems most of which should be on the level\nof a graduate student.\nAdditional gap theorems related to sectional curvature will appear in future papers along with\na survey of sectional curvature results on the length spectrum .\nThe author is grateful to Guofang Wei (UCSB) for many fruitful suggestions, to Wolfgang Ziller\n(U Penn) for guidance through the literature, to Steve Zelditch (JHU) for requesting a thorough\nextension of the convergence results in [SoWei], and to Carolyn Gordon (Dartmouth) for her excellent\nadvise in all things.\n\n2\n\nBackground\n\nHere we provide the necessary background on Gromov-Hausdorff convergence. Readers who are\nonly interested in studying the 1/k length spectrum on a fixed Riemannian manifold may skip to\nSection 3. Essentially all the material here appeared in [G3] and can also be studied in [BBI].\nFor those readers who have studied C k convergence of manifolds, keep in mind that Gromov\nhas proven that if a sequence of compact manifolds Mi converges to M in the C k sense then they\nalso converge in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. While C k convergence requires that the manifolds be\ndiffeomorphic, GH convergence doesn't even require that they have the same dimension. In fact the\nspaces need only be compact metric spaces.\nWe begin with an older concept, the Hausdorff distance between sets.\nDefinition 2.1 Given two compact subsets A, B in a metric space Z, we can define the Hausdorff\ndistance as follows:\ndZ\n(2.1)\nH (A, B) = inf{r : A \u2282 Tr (B) and B \u2282 Tr (A)},\nwhere Tr (X) is the tubular neighborhood around X of radius r:\nTr (X) = {z \u2208 Z : \u2203xz \u2208 X s.t. d(xz , z) < r}.\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe surfaces Mi in Figure 1 would converge in the Hausdorff sense to the standard sphere, Y ,\n3\nas subsets of Z = E , if they were superimposed. One need only take the radius of the tubular\nneighborhood large enough to capture the tiny handles. In this respect the Hausdorff distance is\nblind to the topology of the sets it compares.\nHausdorff distance is also blind to the dimensions of the sets: it can easily be seen that A0 =\n2\n2\n[0, 1] \u00d7 {0} \u2282 E and Ar = [0, 1] \u00d7 [\u2212r, r] \u2282 E satisfy dH (A0 , Ar ) \u2264 r. On the other hand, for small\n4\n\n\fr, one can see how it makes sense that Ar could be thought of as close to A0 . To quote Cheeger,\nthey look very similar \"to the naked eye\".\nGromov extended this concept to compact metric spaces, providing us with a metric between\nspaces that is also blind to dimension and topology, but captures the idea that the spaces are close\nin some blurry sense. [G3]\nBefore we define the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces, recall that f : X \u2192 Z\nis an isometric embedding if it is one-to-one and dX (x1 , x2 ) = dZ (f (x1 ), f (x2 )) for all x1 , x2 \u2208 X.\nThe sphere sitting inside Euclidean space is not isometrically embedded because the distances on\nthe sphere are measure intrinsically (the poles are a distance \u03c0 apart in S 2 ). A plane is isometrically\nembedded in Euclidean space because it is totally geodesic.\nDefinition 2.2 (Gromov) The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two compact metric spaces X\nand Y is defined as follows:\ndGH (X, Y ) = inf{dZ\nH (f (X), g(Y )) : Z, f : X \u2192 Z, g : Y \u2192 Z}\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere the set runs through any metric space, Z, and any isometric embeddings f : X \u2192 Z and\ng : Y \u2192 Z.\nIt is an easy exercise to prove the following two lemmas:\nLemma 2.1 (Gromov)\ndGH (X, Y ) \u2264 diam(X) + diam(Y )\n\n(2.4)\n\nLemma 2.2 (Gromov) If Xi converge to X in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense, dGH (Xi , Y ) \u2192 0 then\ndiam(Xi ) \u2192 diam(X).\nGromov proved that both the space of compact metric spaces and the space of compact length\nspaces are complete with respect to dGH . In particular, he proved the difficult theorem that the\nGromov-Hausdorff limit of a compact length space is a compact length space. [G3]\nWe can now give the details of the sequence of tori collapsing to a circle with disappearing lengths\nthat was mentioned in the introduction.\n1\nbe a flat torus formed by taking the isometric product of a\nExample 2.1 Let Mj = S\u03c01 \u00d7 S\u03c0/j\ncircle of diamter \u03c0 with a circle of diameter 1/j. Note that as j diverges to infinity, Mj converges\nin the Gromov-Hausdorff sense to S\u03c01 . This can be seen by taking Z = Mj itself and isometrically\nembedding S\u03c01 as S\u03c01 \u00d7 {0} \u2282 Mj , so\nM\n\ndGH (Mj , S\u03c01 ) \u2264 dH j (Mj , S\u03c01 \u00d7 {0}) \u2264 \u03c0/j.\n\n(2.5)\n\nIt is well known that the length spectrum of Mj is the collection of distances between lattice\npoints (2\u03c0a, 2\u03c0b/j) where a, b \u2208 Z. Thus\np\n(2.6)\nL(Mj ) = { (2\u03c0a)2 + (2\u03c0b/j)2 : a, b \u2208 N} \u222a {\u03c0, \u03c0/k}.\nNotice how this length spectrum becomes increasingly dense as j goes to infinity, so that for any N\nwe get\nL(Mj ) \u2229 [0, N ] \u2192 [0, N ] in the Hausdorff sense.\n(2.7)\nIn particular, there are lengths lj \u2208 L(Mj ) such that lj \u2192 \u03c0 even though \u03c0 is not in the length\nspectrum of S 1 .\n\n5\n\n\fThe sequence of surfaces in Figure 1 are trickier to deal with as they are not easily isometrically\nembedded into a common space and even the choice of a metric space Z for each Mj is not obvious.\nWe first recall Gromov's concept of an r net on a metric space. A set N \u2282 X is an r net if\nX \u2282 Tr (N ). It is clear that dH (N, X) \u2264 r. When N is a finite collection of points then it is a finite\nnet. Let NX (r) be the minimum cardinality of all r nets in X.\nGromov's famous compactness theorem states that a class of compact metric spaces, {X}, with\na uniform bound on NX (r) \u2264 N (r) is precompact with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff metric. In\nparticular, the class of complete manifolds with Ricci \u2265 \u2212K, dim = n and diam \u2264 D is precompact\n[G3][Bi]. The limits of the sequences are compact length spaces. [G3]\nIf one considers an r net, N \u2282 X, and endows it with the restricted metric from X, then it may\nnot be a length space. However, it is a metric space such that dGH (X, N ) \u2264 dX\nH (X, N ) \u2264 r. Using\nthe triangle inequality, one than sees that dGH (X, Y ) \u2264 2r if both spaces have isometric r nets. We\nnow use this technique to prove the convergence of the surfaces in Figure 1.\nExample 2.2 The surfaces in Figure 1 converge to the standard sphere in the Gromov-Hausdorff\nsense. Let us suppose that Mj with it's handles removed is isometric to a a standard sphere with\ntwo disks of radius 1/j removed and that the diamater of the handles is < 4/j. Now lets form a\nfinite 100/j net on Mj such that for any pair of points in the net, the minimizing geodesic between\nthem does not hit either handle. Since the points in the net aren't on the handles, they correspond\nisometrically to specific points on Y = S 2 . That is we have a metric space Nj , the net, such that\nNj isometrically embeds into both Y and Mj and such that\nM\n\ndH j (Nj , Mj ) \u2264 100/j and dYH (Nj , Y ) \u2264 100/j.\n\n(2.8)\n\ndGH (Mj , Y ) \u2264 dGH (Mj , Nj ) + dGH (Nj , Y ) \u2264 200/j\n\n(2.9)\n\nThus\nand we see that Mj converges to Y is the Gromov-Hausdorff sense.\nNote that it is not necessary to find an isometric pair of r nets in two compact metric spaces X1\nand X2 to prove they are close in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. It suffices to find a pair of \"almost\nisometric\" nets N1 and N2 . Gromov has proven that if both nets have the same cardinality and one\ncan set up a bijection between them: f : N1 \u2192 N2 such that\nsup{|dN1 (x1 , x2 ) \u2212 dN2 (f (x1 ), f (x2 ))| : x1 , x2 \u2208 N1 } < \u01eb\n\n(2.10)\n\nthen one can show dGH (N1 , N2 ) < 2\u01eb [Gr], cf [BBI. Cor 7.3.28]. So in that case dGH (X1 , X2 ) < 2r+\u01eb.\nUsing (2.10) we see that when Xi \u2192 X in the C k sense then they also converge in the GromovHausdorff sense. For example, Figure 2 has a smoothly converging sequence of compact Riemannian\nmanifolds. They are all diffeomoerpic to the sphere with metrics g that converge smoothly, C k ,\nto the limit space. The diffeomorphisms are almost isomorphisms in the sense described in (2.10)\nwithout even requiring the use of finite nets.\nIn fact one need only find fi : Xi \u2192 X which are \u01ebi almost distance preserving,\n|dX (fi (a), fi (b)) \u2212 dXi (a, b)| < \u01ebi\n\n(2.11)\n\nand \u01ebi almost onto, T\u01eb (fi (Xi )) \u2283 X, to prove that Xi converge to X in the Gromov Hausdorff sense.\nExample 2.3 Let Mc be an ellipsoid\n(x)2 + (y)2 + (z/c)2 = 1.\n\n(2.12)\n\nIf we take cj \u2192 \u221e, then Mj = Mcj converges to the doubled disk, Y , in the Gromov Hausdorff\nsense.\n6\n\n\fMore precisely, Y , is two flat disks of radius 1 glued together along the circle, so that the distance\nbetween points on a common disk is the usual Euclidean distance and the distance between points x\nand y on different disks is:\n(2.13)\ndM\u221e (x, y) = inf1 (|x \u2212 z| + |y \u2212 z|).\nz\u2208S\n\nGluing is significantly more complicated when the shapes aren't convex (c.f.[BBI]).\nTo prove that Mj converge to Y in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense, we just employ the maps fi :\nMi \u2192 M , defined to be fi (x, y, z) = (x, y, sgn(z)), where sgn(z) is just used to indicate whether we\nare on the upper or lower disk. Naturally the edge where z = 0 doesn't need a sign.\nExample 2.1 is said to be \"collapsing\" because the dimension of the limit is less than the dimension\nof the sequence. Example 2.2 is considered to be \"noncollapsing\" because the dimension of the\nmanifolds in the sequence is the same as the dimension of the limit space. On the other hand, the\ninjectivity radius is decreasing to 0 in this example.\nThe following definition is a simple extension of a Riemannian injectivity radius.\nDefinition 2.3 The injectivity radius of a compact length space, M , is\ninjradx = sup{t : any geodesic segment of length t is minimal.}\n\n(2.14)\n\nExample 2.4 The Hawaiian Earring, a compact length space consisting of a collection of circles of\nradius 1/j for each j \u2208 N all joined at a common point, has an injectivity radius equal to 0. It is\nalso known to have no universal cover (c.f. [Sp]). That is, there is no covering space which covers\nall the other covering spaces.\nFor completeness of exposition, we now review the fact that there are no disappearing lengths\nwhen the sequence of compact length spaces has a uniform lower bound on injectivity radius.\nProposition 2.3 Suppose Mj are compact length spaces with a common positive lower bound, i0 ,\non their injectivity radiui, and Mj converge to Y in the Gromov-Hausdorff metric, then for any\nR > 0 we have the following Hausdorff limit:\nL(Mj ) \u2229 [0, R] \u2192 L\u221e \u2282 L(Y ) \u2229 [0, R].\n\n(2.15)\n\nThat is, for all \u01eb > 0, \u2203N\u01eb,R \u2208 N such that\nL(Mj ) \u2229 [0, R] \u2282 T\u01eb (L(Y )).\n\n(2.16)\n\nNote that when manifolds converge smoothly, they do have a common lower bound on their\ninjectivity radius. So Figure 2 demonstrates that one still might have suddenly appearing geodesics\nin this case.\nOne can see that N\u01eb,R depends on R, just by examining a sequence of circles of radius rj \u2192 \u03c0\nconverging to the standard circle. The errors accumulate as you wrap repeatedly around the same\ngeodesic. So one needs a common upper bound, R, on the length of the geodesic to get a common\nrate of convergence.\nProof: Let \u03b3i be the geodesics of length Li \u2192 L\u221e . For i sufficiently large, Li \u2208 [2i0 , 2L\u221e ]. Thus\nthe \u03b3i : S 1 \u2192 Mi are equicontinuous. By the Grove-Petersen Arzela-Ascoli Theorem, a subsequence\nof the \u03b3i converge to \u03b3\u221e : S 1 \u2192 Y , of length L\u221e . [GrPet]\nOne may consider Proposition 2.3 as a kind of semicontinuity of the length spectrum with respect\nto Gromov-Hausdorff convergence. One of the goals of this paper is to prove a similar convergence\ntheorem for spaces without a common lower bound on injectivity radius.\n\n7\n\n\f3\n\n1/k Geodesics\n\nWe now introduce a new length spectrum, L1/k , which we will later prove has a strong relationship\nwith Gromov-Hausdorff convergence. Here we focus on the properties of this new concept on a\nfixed compact length space or Riemannian manifold and it's relationship with the traditional length\nspectrum.\nDefinition 3.1 A 1/k geodesic is a closed geodesic, \u03b3 : S 1 \u2192 M , which is minimizing on all\nsubsegments of length L/k where L = Length(\u03b3):\nd(\u03b3(t), \u03b3(t + 2\u03c0/k)) = L\u03b3 ([t, t + 2\u03c0/k]) = L/k\n\n\u2200t \u2208 S 1 .\n\n(3.1)\n\nDefinition 3.2 Let the 1/k Length Spectrum, L1/k (M ) \u2282 L(M ), be the set of lengths of 1/k\ngeodesics.\nThe following lemma is immediate:\nLemma 3.1 L1/k (M ) \u2282 L1/(k+1) (M ).\nDefinition 3.3 The minimizing index, minind(\u03b3), of a geodesic, \u03b3, is the smallest k \u2208 N such that\nthe geodesic is a 1/k geodesic.\nTheorem 3.1 Any closed geodesic is a 1/k geodesic for a sufficiently large number k. So\n\u221e\n[\n\nL1/k (M ) = L(M ).\n\n(3.2)\n\nk=1\n\nProof: If \u03b3 : S 1 \u2192 M is a closed geodesic then for all t, there exists \u01ebt > 0 such that \u03b3 is minimizing\nfrom t \u2212 \u01ebt to t + \u01ebt . The intervals (t \u2212 \u01ebt , t + \u01ebt ) form an open cover of S 1 and since S 1 is compact,\nthere is a finite subcover and a Lebesgue number, \u03c1 > 0, for this cover. The \u03b3 is a 1/k geodesic for\nany k > 2\u03c0/\u03c1.\nLemma 3.2 If diam(M ) \u2264 D then minind(\u03b3) \u2265 L(\u03b3)/D and L1/k (M ) \u2282 (0, Dk].\nProof: If minind(\u03b3) = k, then \u03b3, must be minimizing on segments of length L(\u03b3)/k. So L(\u03b3)/k \u2264\nD.\nRecall Definition 2.3 of the injectivity radius.. It is easy to see that L(M ) \u2282 [2injrad(M ), \u221e).\nThe injectivity radius also provides the following useful relationship between L(M ) and L1/k (M ).\nLemma 3.3 If M has injrad(M ) \u2265 i0 > 0 then for all L0 > 0,\nL(M ) \u2229 [0, L0 ] = L1/k (M ) \u2229 [0, L0 ] where k \u2265 L0 /i0 .\n\n(3.3)\n\nProof: Let \u03b3 : S 1 \u2192 M be any closed geodesic with L(\u03b3) \u2264 L0 . Then any segment from \u03b3(t)\nto \u03b3(t + L/(2\u03c0k)) has length \u2264 L0 /k \u2264 i0 . Thus it is minimizing on this interval and \u03b3 is a 1/k\ngeodesic.\nThis estimate is only sharp when the injectivity radius of the manifold is achieved by a pair\nof points on the geodesic. There is no reason that a distant pair of cut points or a cut point\nperpendicular to the geodesic should affect its minimizing index. In Example 3.2 below we will see\nthat in a thin torus, S\u03b41 \u00d7 S\u03c01 , there is a 1/2 geodesic of length 2\u03c0 no matter how small the injectivity\nradius, \u03b4, of the torus is. For this reason we make the following new definition.\n8\n\n\fDefinition 3.4 The injectivity radius, injrad(\u03b3) of a closed geodesic \u03b3, is\ninjrad(\u03b3) = inf{ht : t \u2208 S 1 }\n\n(3.4)\n\nht = sup{h : \u03b3 is minimizing on [t, t+h].}\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere\nThe following lemma is easily follows from Definitions 3.1 and 3.4.\nLemma 3.4 A closed geodesic \u03b3 of length L satisfies\nL\nL\n\u2264 injrad(\u03b3) <\n.\nminind(\u03b3)\n(minind(\u03b3) \u2212 1)\n\n(3.6)\n\nRecall that a prime geodesic is a closed geodesic whose period is 2\u03c0. All closed geodesics are\neither prime geodesics or iterated geodesics of the form \u03b3n (t) = \u03b31 (nt) where \u03b31 is a prime geodesic,\nand n \u2208 N.\nLemma 3.5 If \u03b31 : S 1 \u2192 M is a 1/k closed geodesic and \u03b3n : S 1 \u2192 M is defined by \u03b3n (t) = \u03b31 (nt),\nthen \u03b3n is an 1/(kn) geodesic. In fact\nminind(\u03b3n ) \u2208 [n(minind(\u03b31 ) \u2212 1), n minind(\u03b31 ))] \u2229 [2n, \u221e).\n\n(3.7)\n\nProof: Let L be the length of \u03b31 and k = minind(\u03b31 ). Then nL = L(\u03b3n ) and\nd(\u03b3n (t), \u03b3n (t + (2\u03c0/(kn))) = d(\u03b31 (nt), \u03b31 (nt + 2\u03c0/(k))) = L/k = L(\u03b3n )/(nk),\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhich implies that minind(\u03b3n ) \u2264 (nk). On the other hand, suppose j = minind(\u03b3n ), then\nnL/j = d(\u03b3n (t), \u03b3n (t + (2\u03c0/j)) = d(\u03b31 (nt), \u03b31 (nt + 2\u03c0n/j))\n\n(3.9)\n\nSo injrad(\u03b31 ) \u2265 nL(\u03b31 )/j and applying Lemma 3.4 we get\nL(\u03b31 )/(minind(\u03b31 ) \u2212 1) \u2265 injrad(\u03b31 ) \u2265 nL(\u03b31 )/j\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhich implies minind(\u03b31 ) \u2212 1 \u2264 (j/n) \u2264 minind(\u03b3n )/n.\nOur final consideration is that injrad(\u03b31 ) \u2264 L(\u03b31 )/2, so minind(\u03b3n ) \u2265 2n.\nWe can now apply these lemmas to examine some examples.\nExample 3.1 Suppose S 2 is the standard sphere. It is well known that all its prime closed geodesics\nhave length 2\u03c0. These geodesics can easily be seen to be 1/2 geodesics. By Lemma 3.5, we then have\n2k\u03c0 \u2208 L1/2k (S 2 )\n\n(3.11)\n\n{2\u03c0, 4\u03c0, ...2k\u03c0} \u2282 L1/2k (S 2 ) \u2282 L1/(2k+1) (S 2 ).\n\n(3.12)\n\nand by Lemma 3.1,\nThis also follows directly from Lemma 3.3. On the other hand, by Lemma 3.2,\nL1/j (S 2 ) \u2282 L(S 2 ) \u2229 (0, j\u03c0]\n\n(3.13)\n\nL1/2k (S 2 ) = L1/(2k+1) (S 2 ) = {2\u03c0, 4\u03c0, ...2k\u03c0}.\n\n(3.14)\n\nwhich gives\n\n9\n\n\f1\nExample 3.2 Let Mj = S\u03c01 \u00d7 S\u03c0/j\nbe a flat torus from Example 2.1. The closed geodesics of the\ntorus are of the form\n\u03b3(t) = ((at + x0 )mod2\u03c0, (bt/j + y0 )mod2\u03c0/j) ,\n(3.15)\n\nwhere a, b \u2208 Z and x0 , ky0 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0]. It is minimizing until |a|t = \u03c0 or |b|t/j = \u03c0/j, that is until\nt = min{\u03c0/|a|, \u03c0/|b|}. So it's minimizing index is\nminind(\u03b3) = max{2|a|, 2|b|}.\n\n(3.16)\n\nNote that \u03b3 is a prime geodesic whenever a and b are relatively prime or ab = 0 and one of them\nhas absolute value 1. In particular the geodesic with b = a + 1 is a prime geodesic. So for any\nnatural number, k, there is a prime geodesic in the torus of with minimizing index = 2k.\nThe length of our arbitrary geodesic, \u03b3, is\np\n(3.17)\nL(\u03b3) = (2\u03c0a)2 + (2\u03c0b/k)2\nSo, skipping the trivial geodesic, we have\np\nL1/(2k) (Mj ) = { (2\u03c0a)2 + (2\u03c0b/j)2 : a, b = 0, 1, 2, ...k} \\ {0}.\n\n(3.18)\n\nand L1/(2k\u22121) (Mj ) = L1/(2k) (Mj ).\nRecall Lemma 3.5 which states that the nth iterate of 1/k geodesic is a 1/(nk) geodesic. This\ndoes not mean its minimizing index is nk. In fact in Example 3.3 we will demonstrate that the\nminimizing index of an iterated geodesic may take on any natural number allowed in the Lemma.\nExample 3.3 We claim that for any k \u2208 N there exists ck \u2208 (0, 1] such that the the ellipsoid,\nM (ck ):\n(x)2 + (y)2 + (z/ck )2 = 1.\n(3.19)\nhas a prime geodesic \u03b3ck (t) = (cos(t), sin(t), 0) whose minimizing index is k + 1. Furthermore, for\nany n \u2208 N, there exists cn,k \u2208 (0, 1] such that \u03b3c (nt) has minimizing index equal to k + n.\nThe brute force proof of the claim is to use the recent work of Itoh and Kiyohara to explicitly determine the cut locus of the points on this geodesic [ItKi]. One sees that injrad(\u03b3c ) varies\ncontinuously with c taking on all values in (0, \u03c0). The claim then follows by applying Lemma 3.4\nLemma 3.2 implies that the minimizing index of a closed geodesic, \u03b3 : S 1 \u2192 M satisfies\nminind(\u03b3) \u2265 L(\u03b3)/Diam(M ).\n\n(3.20)\n\nThus any sequence of indefinitely increasingly long geodesics, like the prime geodesics found by\nGromoll-Myer [GlMy], have minimizing index approaching infinity. This is also known to be true of\nthe Morse Index which will be discussed later in Section 10.\n\n4\n\n1/2 Geodesics and the Covering Spectrum\n\nIn this section we produce a wealth of 1/2 geodesics in length spaces which are not simply connected.\nLemma 4.1 A closed geodesic which is the shortest among all noncontractible closed geodesics is a\n1/2 geodesic.\nThis lemma is a consequence of the following one applied to the universal cover.\nLemma 4.2 If M\u0303 is a covering space of M and c is the shortest curve which lifts nontrivially to\nM\u0303 , then c is a 1/2 geodesic.\n10\n\n\fProof: If c : S 1 \u2192 M is not a 1/2 geodesic, then \u2203t0 > 0 such that d(c(t0 ), c(t0 + \u03c0)) < L/2. So\nwe can join c(t0 ) to c(t0 + \u03c0/L) by a geodesic segment \u03b7 of length < L/2. Let c1 to be the curve\ncreated by taking c restricted to [t0 , t0 + \u03c0] followed by \u03b7 \u22121 and c2 to be \u03b7 followed by c from t0 + \u03c0\nwrappping around to t0 . Since both ci are shorter than c, they must lift trivially to M\u0303 . This forces\nc to lift trivially as well, contradicting the hypothesis.\nNote that closed geodesics which are minimizers in their homotopy classes are not necessarily\n1/2 geodesics. This can be seen by looking at the geodesics in Figure 1 or by considering iterated geodesics in a torus. The covering spaces which unwrap these geodesics, also unwrap shorter\ngeodesics, thus these geodesics do not satify the hypothesis of Lemma 4.2.\nGeodesics which do satisy the hypothesis of Lemma 4.2 were studied in [SoWei]. Their lengths\ncorrespond to the elements of the covering spectrum, which is defined using a special selection of\ncovering spaces [Defn 3.1, Theorem 4.12 [SoWei]]. We can now improve this theorem.\nTheorem 4.1 If X is a compact space with a simply connected universal cover, then\n2CovSpec(X) \u2282 L1/2 (X).\n\n(4.1)\n\nProof: Theorem 4.12 of [SoWei] , stated that 2CovSpec(X) \u2282 L(X). A key step in the proof is\nLemma 4.9 of [SoWei], where one takes any element \u03b4 \u2208 CovSpec(X) and produces a a corresponding\ncurve c of length 2\u03b4 which satisfies the hypothesis of Lemma 4.2 above.\n\n5\n\nSystoles and 1/2 Geodesics\n\nRecall that the systole of a manifold, sys(M ), is the length of the shortest noncontractible closed\ngeodesic (c.f.[CrKt]). This definition easily extends to any compact length space with a universal\ncover or a positive injectivity radius. Without a positive injectivity radius the systole may be 0 (see\nExample 2.4).\nCombining Lemma 4.2 applied to the universal cover of M we immediately obtain the following\nlemma:\nLemma 5.1 If M is a compact length space with a universal cover, then the shortest 1/2 geodesic\nhas length\nsys(M ) \u2208 L1/2 (M ) \u2282 (0, 2 diam(M )]\n(5.1)\nthus min L1/2 (M ) \u2264 sys(M ).\nNote that it is quite possible that this is a strict inequality as the shortest 1/2 geodesic could be\ncontractible and wrapped around some small \"knob\" (c.f. [CoHng]).\nThere is a significant body of research providing upper bounds on the systole of various surfaces,\nand thus also min L1/2 . See for example, Croke and Katz's recent survey article [CrKt]. Croke and\nKatz combine an inequality of Gromov [G2] with a theorem by Pu [Pu], to obtain the following\nproposition which we rephrase using Corollary 5.1.\nProposition 5.2 (Pu) If M 2 is not diffeomorphic to a sphere, then\n(min L1/2 (M ))2 \u2264 sys(M )2 \u2264 \u03c0V ol(M )/2\nand when equality holds, M 2 is the standard\n\nRP 2 with constant sectional curvature.\n\nWe may also rephrase Loewner's result (c.f. [CrKt]).\n\n11\n\n(5.2)\n\n\fProposition 5.3 (Loewner) If M 2 is diffeomorphic to a torus, then\n\u221a\n(min L1/2 (M ))2 \u2264 sys(M )2 \u2264 2V ol(M )/ 3\n\n(5.3)\n\nand when equality holds, M is a skewed flat torus with a 120 degree angle.\nIn the following example the equality is only achieved on a singular manifold, so it is necessary\nto use our compact length definition of a 1/2 geodesic. [Bav][Sak]\nProposition 5.4 (Bavard, Sakai) If M 2 is diffeomorphic to\n\nRP 2 #RP 2 , then\n\n(min L1/2 (M ))2 \u2264 sys(M )2 \u2264 \u03c0V ol(M )/23/2 .\n\n(5.4)\n\nIn this case equality doesn't hold on a manifold, but rather on a singular space formed by gluing\ntogether two moebius strips of constant sectional curvature 1, with width \u03c0/2 and central curve of\nlength \u03c0 along a singular circle.\n\u221a The singular circle is a geodesic in the metric space sense and\nachieves the minimal length, 2\u03c0 = \u03c0V ol(M )/23/2 .\nIn the case of manifolds diffeomorphic to S 2 , all geodesics are contractible and the situation is\nmuch more complicated. Calabi and Croke have conjectured that on a surface diffeomorphic to a\nsphere,\n\u221a p\nmin L \u2264 12 V ol(M )),\n(5.5)\n\nand an example achieving this inequality appears in [Cr].\nThe strongest result in this direction is by Rotman [Ro].\n\nProposition 5.5 (Rotman) If M 2 is diffeomorphic to a sphere then\n\u221a p\nmin L \u2264 4 2 V ol(M ).\n\n(5.6)\n\nThe best estimate based on diameter is in [NaRo] and independantly [Sab]:\nProposition 5.6 (Nabutovsky-Rotman, Sabourou) If M 2 is diffeomorphic to a sphere then\nmin L \u2264 4 Diam(M ).\n\n(5.7)\n\nNote that neither Proposition 5.5 nor 5.6 provide bounds on min L1/2 \u2264 min L. It would be\ninteresting to examine their proofs and see whether their techniques would provide upper bounds\non the various min L1/k [Problem 11.6].\nRemark 5.7 Note that if we were to try to extend these volume estimates to compact length spaces\nthen we would need a measure and a dimension for the spaces. One might study compact length\nspaces with finite second Hausdorff measure. See Problem 11.7.\nThere are many beautiful results estimating min L(M ) for manifolds with curvature bounds, but\ndiscussion of such results and their relation to the L1/k must be posponed to future papers.\n\n6\n\nEstimating the Length of the Shortest Closed Geodesic\n\nIn this section we discuss how 1/k geodesics may be used to estimate the length of the shortest\nclosed geodesic in a Riemannian manifold or compact length space.\nGromov [G2] has conjectured that for a compact Riemannian manifold M ,\n1\n\nmin L(M ) \u2264 c(n)V ol(M n ) n\n12\n\n(6.1)\n\n\fand another well-known conjecture is that\nmin L(M ) \u2264 c(n)Diam(M n ).\n\n(6.2)\n\nmin L(M ) \u2264 2Diam(M n )\n\n(6.3)\n\nIn fact Rotman suggests that\nand there are no known counterexamples. Note that (6.3) is trivially true when the manifold is not\nsimply connected (c.f. covspec lemma and Remark 6.1).\nRemark 6.1 It follows from Lemma 3.2, that if L1/2 (M ) is nonempty, then\nmin L(M ) \u2264 min L1/2 (M ) \u2264 2diam(M ).\n\n(6.4)\n\nHowever, the author has recently been informed that Wing Kai Ho has produced examples of smooth\nmanifolds diffeomorphic to S 2 which have no 1/2 geodesics [Ho]. In Problem 11.8, we ask what\nproperties can be imposed on a manifold that would guarantee the existence of a 1/2 geodesic.\nTo provide an estimate on min L it is necessary to define the following quantity:\nDefinition 6.1 The minimizing index, minind(M ), of a compact length space, M , is the smallest\nk such that there is a geodesic of minimizing index k.\nTheorem 6.1 If M is a compact length space then\nmin L(M ) \u2264 minind(M )diam(M ).\n\n(6.5)\n\nProof: Setting k = minind(M ), we know We know min L(M ) \u2264 min L1/k (M ) \u2264 kdiam(M ) by\nLemma 3.2\nThe following theorem might help one find counterexamples to overly sharp conjectures regarding\nmin L(M ). See Problems 11.11 and 11.12.\nTheorem 6.2 If M is a compact length space and k = minind(M ) then\nmin L(M ) \u2265 min{k injrad(M ), min L1/k (M )}.\n\n(6.6)\n\nProof: By Lemma 3.3, if M has injrad(M ) \u2265 i0 > 0 and minimality index k, then taking L0 = io k\nwe have\nL(M ) \u2229 [0, L0 ] = L1/k (M ) \u2229 [0, L0 ].\n(6.7)\nThus min L(M ) either = min L1/k (M ) or it is > io k.\nWhen M is a manifold we can use Klingenberg's old lemma to estimate its minimizing index as\nfollows [K1] (c.f. [doC]):\nLemma 6.2 (Klingenberg) Let M be a compact Riemannian manifold. If x is the closest cut\npoint to y, then either x is a conjugate point of y, or there are exactly two geodesics from y to x\nand they meet at 180\u25e6 . If x and y are cut points such that dM (x, y) = injrad(M ), then either they\nare conjugate points or there are exactly two geodesics from x to y and together they form a closed\ngeodesic.\nCorollary 6.3 If M is a compact Riemannian manifold with no conjugate points then the shortest closed geodesic is a 1/2 geodesic of length 2injrad(M ). So minind(M ) = 2 and minL =\n2injrad(M ).\n13\n\n\fIn Problem 11.5 we ask for an appropriate extension of the definition of conjugate point to\ncompact length spaces which might allow one to extend Corollary 6.3.\nNote that Klingenberg applied his lemma to manifolds with negative sectional curvature as these\nspaces have no conjugate points. We suggest in Problem 11.4 that Corollary 6.3 might extend to\nCAT(0) spaces.\nIn general, however, the author leaves the discussion of the rich literature concerning the length\nspectrum and sectional curvature bounds out of this paper. We will discuss Ricci curvature bounds\nas such bounds lead to applications relating to Gromov-Hausdorff convergence.\n\n7\n\nConvergence without Sudden Disappearances\n\nIn this section we prove our main convergence theorem and present some simple illustrative examples.\nTheorem 7.1 If Mi \u2192 M in the GH sense then L1/k (Mi ) converges to a subset of L1/k (M ) \u222a {0}\nin the Hausdorff sense. That is, for all \u01eb, R > 0, there exists N\u01eb \u2208 N such that\nL1/k (Mi ) \u2229 [0, R] \u2282 T\u01eb (L1/k (M ) \u222a {0})\n\n\u2200i \u2265 N\u01eb .\n\n(7.1)\n\nRecall that in Figure 2 we gave an example with suddenly appearing 1/2 geodesics, which are\nnot the limits of such a sequence of Li or even Li selected from L(Mi ).\nProof: Suppose, on the contrary, there exists \u01eb such that for a subsequence of the i there are\nLi \u2208 L1/k (Mi ) \\ T\u01eb (L1/k (M ) \u222a {0}).\n\n(7.2)\n\nBy Lemma 3.2 and the fact that Gromov-Hausdorff convergence implies that diam(Mi ) \u2192 D =\ndiam(M ), Li \u2208 [0, kdiam(Mi )] \u2282 [0, 2kD]. So a further subsequence must converge, Li \u2192 L0 , where\nL0 \u2208 (0, 2kD] \\ L1/k (M ).\n\n(7.3)\n\nThus there exists corresponding 1/k geodesics \u03b3i : S 1 \u2192 Mi of speed Li /(2\u03c0). By Grove Petersen's\nArzela-Ascoli Theorem [GrPet], we know that a subsequence of the \u03b3i converges to a curve c : S 1 \u2192\nM of length L0 . Furthermore\ndM (c(t \u2212 pi/k, c(t + \u03c0/k)) =\n=\n\nlim dMi (\u03b3i (t \u2212 \u03c0/k), \u03b3i (t + \u03c0/k))\n\n(7.4)\n\nlim Li /k = L0 /k,\n\n(7.5)\n\ni\u2192\u221e\n\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nso c is either a 1/k geodesic or it is trivial. This contradicts (7.3)\nRemark 7.1 The same proof could be used to show that if \u03b3i all have injrad(\u03b3i ) \u2265 r0 , then their\nlimit does as well.\nThe following two corollaries are immediate:\nCorollary 7.2 Suppose Li \u2208 L(Mi ) and Li \u2192 L\u221e \u2208\n/ L(M ) where M is the Gromov-Hausdorff\nlimit of the Mi . Then the geodesics \u03b3i : S 1 \u2192 Mi of length L(\u03b3i ) = Li have minind(\u03b3i ) diverging to\ninfinity.\nCorollary 7.3 Given any compact length space M , L1/k (M ) \u222a {0} is compact.\n\n14\n\n\f1\nExample 7.1 Recall Mj = S\u03c01 \u00d7 S\u03c0/j\n, the flat tori of Example 2.1 that converged to a circle whose\nlength spectra had disappearing lengths. In Example 3.2, we showed L1/(2k) (Mj ) is the union:\np\n(7.6)\n{ (2\u03c0a)2 + (2\u03c0b/j)2 : a, b = 1, 2, ...k} \u222a {2\u03c0b/j : b = 1, 2, ...k} \u222a {2\u03c0a : a = 1, 2, ...k}\n\nand L1/(2k\u22121) (Mj ) = L1/(2k) (Mj ). As j diverges to infinity, L1/(2k) (Mj ), converges in the Hausdorff\nsense to the union\np\n{ (2\u03c0a)2 + (0b)2 : a, b = 1, 2, ...k} \u222a {(0b : b = 1, 2, ...k} \u222a {2\u03c0a : a = 1, 2, ...k}\n(7.7)\nwhich is = {2\u03c0a : a = 0, 1, 2, ...k} = L1/(2k) (S 1 ).\n\nExample 7.2 Recall the sequence of ellipsoids, Mj2 , from Example 2.3 converging to a doubled\ndisk, Y .\nNote that the curves hj (t) = (cos(t), sin(t), 0) mapped into Mj are closed geodesics. Their pointwise limit as cj \u2192 0 is h\u221e (t) = (cos(t), sin(t), 0) mapped into M\u221e . Note that h\u221e is parametrized\nby arclength but\n(7.8)\ndM\u221e (h\u221e (t \u2212 \u01eb), h\u221e (t + \u01eb)) = 2sin(\u01eb) < 2\u01eb.\nSo h\u221e is not a closed geodesic. Thus there exists no uniform lower bound on the minimizing index\nof the hj : S 1 \u2192 Mj . This can also be seen using the recent work of [ItKi]\nThe next example demonstrates why it is necessary to study 1/k geodesics rather than just\nsmooth regular polygons that are minimizing between only k specific regularly spaced points instead\nof any collection of k regularly spaced points.\n3\n\nExample 7.3 In Figure 3 we see M\u01eb \u2282 E , the boundary of the \u01eb tubular neighborhood around\n2\na flat solid regular square Z \u2208 E \u00d7 {0}. For \u01eb sufficiently small we can see that the geodesic,\n1\n\u03b3\u01eb : S \u2192 M\u01eb running around the equator looks almost like a square. If one chooses a specific\nregularly spaced selection of four points on \u03b3\u01eb each of which is close to the corner of the square, one\nsees that \u03b3\u01eb is minimizing between these points. However \u03b3\u01eb is not a 1/4 geodesic.\n\nFigure 3: The black closed geodesic, \u03b3\u01eb , is minimizing between the four corners but not their\nmidpoints as indicated by the white geodesic segment.\nAs in Example 7.2, the limit space as \u01eb approaches 0 is a doubled copy of Z glued to itself along\nthe square boundary. The square boundary is only piecewise minimizing between the corners and is\nnot a closed geodesic. Thus the \u03b3\u01eb do not converge to a closed geodesic in the limit space.\nRemark 7.4 If Mi converge to the standard S n smoothly, then Bangert proved that the prime\ngeodesics in Mi either have lengths converging to 2\u03c0 or to \u221e [Bng]. Note that the prime geodesics\n\u03b3i whose lengths diverge to infinity, have minimal indices also diverging to infinity by Lemma 3.2.\nBangert's Theorem does not extend to Mi converging to S n in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. If we\n1\ntake Mj = S n \u00d7 S1/j\nand prime geodesics wrapping once around the equator of S n while wrapping\n1\nj times around the S1/j\n. These all have length 4\u03c0. Also the geodesics in Example 1 are prime\ngeodesics converging to a length < \u03c0.\n15\n\n\fIn Problem 11.14 we ask whether Bangert's Theorem described here holds when one assumes\nthe Mi converge in the Gromov Hausdorff sense with a uniform positive lower bound on injectivity\nradius.\n\n8\n\nGap Theorems and Ricci Curvature\n\nIn this section we apply the length spectrum convergence theorem [Theorem 7.1] to force the existence\nof gaps in the length spectrum of certain manifolds with Ricci curvature bounds. We begin by\nrephrasing Theorem 7.1 as a gap theorem:\nTheorem 8.1 Fix a compact length space, M , and choose any \u01eb > 0 k \u2208 N, then there exists \u03b4\u01eb,k,M\nsuch that if\n(a, b) \u2229 L1/k(M ) = \u2205\n(8.1)\nthen\n[a + \u01eb, b \u2212 \u01eb] \u2229 L1/k (N ) = \u2205\n\n(8.2)\n\nfor all compact length spaces N such that dGH (N, M ) < \u03b4\u01eb,k,M .\nProof: Suppose on the contrary that there exists \u01eb > 0, k \u2208 N and Ni converging to M with\nLi \u2208 [a + \u01eb, b \u2212 \u01eb] \u2229 L1/k (Ni ).\n\n(8.3)\n\nThen by Theorem 7.1, a subsequence of the Li converge to some L \u2208 L1/k (M ). Since Li \u2208 [a+\u01eb, b\u2212\u01eb],\nso is L which contradicts (8.1).\nThe next gap theorem refers directly to the length spectrum.\nTheorem 8.2 Fix a compact length space, M , and choose any \u01eb > 0 and b > 0, then there exists\n\u03b4\u01eb,b,M such that if\n(ai0 , bi0 ) \u2229 L(M ) = \u2205\n(8.4)\nthen\n[ai0 + \u01eb, bi0 \u2212 \u01eb] \u2229 L(N ) = \u2205\n\n(8.5)\n\nfor all compact length spaces N such that dGH (N, M ) < \u03b4\u01eb,b,M with injrad(N ) \u2265 i0 .\nProof: First note that (8.4) implies that\n(ai0 , bi0 ) \u2229 L1/k (M ) = \u2205\n\n\u2200k \u2208 N.\n\n(8.6)\n\nNow we choose k \u2265 b, and apply Theorem 8.1 for that k, and take \u03b4\u01eb,b,M := \u03b4\u01eb,k,M , which implies\nthat\n[a + \u01eb, b \u2212 \u01eb] \u2229 L1/k (N ) = \u2205.\n(8.7)\nRestricting to N with injrad(N ) \u2265 i0 and applying Lemma 3.3, we get (8.5).\nNotice if one happens to take a sequence of Ni \u2192 M whose injectivity radii converge to 0, we\ncan still apply Theorem 8.2 but the gaps slide over towards 0 and shrink. This is seen to be exact\nin Example 2.1.\nWhen one has C 2 convergence of the manifolds, Ehrlich has proven the injectivity radii converge,\nin which case Theorem 8.2 is significantly stronger and basically already known [Eh].\nIt is crucial to understand that even with smooth convergence we do not get uniform \u03b4 depending only on \u01eb. They will always depend on the manifold itself. Otherwise we would never have\nsuddenly appearing geodesics. That is, if \u03b4M,b,\u01eb did not depend on M , then take Mi converging\n16\n\n\fsmoothly to Y as in Figure 2 and b twice the length of the suddenly appearing geodesic, then\nfor dGH (Mi , Y ) < \u03b4b,\u01eb we'd contradict the existence of that suddenly appeared geodesic. In fact\n\u03b4Mi ,b,\u01eb > (b/2)\u01ebdGH (Mi , Y ), so that N which are much closer to Mi than Mi is to Y will have a gap\nsuch that there is no geodesic of length b/2.\nThereoms 8.1 and 8.2 can now be applied to a number of stability results to prove the gap\ntheorems mentioned in the introduction.\nRecall that Bishop proved that any Riemannian manifold M n with Ricci \u2265 (n\u22121) and V ol(M n ) =\nV ol(S n ) is isometric to the sphere [Bi]. The stability theorem for this rigidity result was proven by\nColding [Co1]:\nProposition 8.1 (Colding) If N n has Ricci(N n) \u2265 \u2212(n \u2212 1), then for all \u01eb > 0, there exists\n\u03b4\u01eb,n > 0 such that\nV ol(N n ) \u2265 V ol(S n ) \u2212 \u03b4\u01eb,n\n(8.8)\n\nimplies dGH (N n , S n ) < \u01eb.\n\nThis proposition combined with Theorem 8.1 and the length spectrum of S n in Example 3.1\nimplies the following:\nProposition 8.2 For all \u01eb > 0, and any k \u2208 N, there exists \u03b4\u01eb,k,n > 0 such that\nV ol(N n ) \u2265 V ol(S n ) \u2212 \u03b4\u01eb,k,n\n\n(8.9)\n\nand Ricci(N n ) \u2265 \u2212(n \u2212 1) then for all j \u2208 {0, 1, 2, ...} we have:\n[2j\u03c0 + \u01eb, 2(j + 1)\u03c0 \u2212 \u01eb] \u2229 L1/(2k) (N ) = \u2205.\n\n(8.10)\n\nCombining this proposition with Lemma 2.2 and Lemma 3.2 we obtain Theorem 1.1 which was\nstated in the introduction.\nRemark 8.3 Problem 11.20 asks for precise estimates on the estimating function in Theorem 1.1.\nGiven a precise estimate, one would be able to bound the volume of a manifold N n with Ricci \u2265 (n\u22121)\ndepending on the length and minimal index of one of its closed geodesics.\nAlthough Colding did later prove convergence in the C 1,\u03b1 topology [Co3], there are manifolds,\nsatisfying Ricci(Min ) \u2265 (n \u2212 1) , V ol(Mi ) \u2192 V ol(S n ) whose injectivity radii injrad(Mi ) \u2192 0\n[Example 8.1] So we cannot presume to improve the length spectrum's convergence or obtain an\nestimate on min L(N n ) without imposing an additional condition on the injectivity radius.\n\nMin ,\n\nExample 8.1 We now construct smooth American footballs, Mj2 , with sect \u2265 1 (and thus Ricci \u2265 1)\nwhose volume V ol(Mj ) \u2265 a2j V ol(S 2 ) \u2212 \u01ebj with aj \u2192 1 and injrad(Mj ) \u2264 rj \u2192 0.\nStart with the standard S 2 , remove a wedge of angle (1 \u2212 aj )2\u03c0 < \u03c0/4, and glue the edges\nto themselves to get a singular manifold, Fj , of volume a2j V ol(S 2 ). For small rj > 0, take two\npoints pj , p\u2032j both rj /2 away from a singular point and maximally far apart. There are two distinct\ngeodesics running between them of length less than rj . Let hj be the distance from these geodesics\nto the singular point. Then hj > rj cos(aj \u03c0/2), the height of the Euclidean comparison triangle.\nNow if we remove balls of radius hj /2 about the two singular points in Fj , we can cap off these\nregions smoothly with caps whose sect \u2265 1 This gives our surfaces Mj and the points pj and p\u2032j are\nstill cut points in Mj and so injrad(Mj ) < rj and V ol(Mj ) \u2265 V ol(Fj ) \u2212 \u03c0rj2 .\nIt is not clear how the length spectrum of these Mj behave. Are there examples of Mj with\nmin L(Mj ) \u2192 0 or a disappearing length? [Problems 11.21 and 11.22].\n\n17\n\n\fMyers Theorem states that any manifold M n with Ricci \u2265 (n \u2212 1) has diam(M n ) \u2264 \u03c0 because\nany geodesic of length \u03c0 must have a conjugate point (c.f. [doC] [My]). Cheng's Sphere Rigidity\nTheorem states that this inequality is only achieved on a sphere [Chng].\nCheng's Theorem doesn't have a stability theorem like Proposition 8.1, as is demonstrated by\nOtsu's examples [Ot]. Otsu's five dimensional manifolds satisfy the Ricci bound and their diameter\napproaches \u03c0 but they converge in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense to a singular manifold not a sphere.\nThis limit space contains only two points which are a distance \u03c0 apart.\nRemark 8.4 Cheeger-Colding have proven that a manifold with Ricci \u2265 (n \u2212 1) and diameter close\nto \u03c0 is Gromov-Hausdorff close to a spherical suspension over a subset of the manifold [ChCo].\nThis is called an \"almost rigidity\" result rather than a stabilit result because they do not prove it is\nclose to a particular metric space, but rather than the metric bahaves in an almost rigid manner. In\nProblem 11.23, we question whether one can obtain a gap theorem based on such a result. One of\nthe biggest difficulties there would be turning this spherical suspension into a length space and not\njust a metric space. Then naturally one would need to know if there are any uniform properties of\nthe length spectrum on spherical suspensions [Problem 11.24].\nTo avoid the issue arising in Otsu's examples, Colding instead examined the radius:\nDefinition 8.1 The radius of a compact metric space, M , is the smallest r > 0 such that M \u2282 B\u0304p (r)\nfor some p. In fact\nrad(M ) = inf sup d(p, q) \u2264 diam(M ).\n(8.11)\np\u2208M q\u2208M\n\nWhen a manifold with Ricci \u2265 (n \u2212 1) has radius close to \u03c0, then every point in the manifold has\na point almost maximally distant from it, thus it is approaching the inequality in Myer's Theorem\nalong every geodesic in the manifold. Colding proved the following stability result [Co2]\nProposition 8.5 [Colding] Given n \u2265 2 and \u01eb > 0 there exists \u03b4(n, \u01eb) > 0 such that if N n is a\ncompact Riemannian manifold whose Ricci(M ) \u2265 (n \u2212 1) and rad(M ) > \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b4 then V ol(M ) >\nV ol(S n ) \u2212 \u01eb.\nCombining Proposition 8.5 with Theorem 8.1 we obtain:\n+\n\nTheorem 8.3 There exists a function \u03a8 : R \u00d7 N \u00d7 N \u2192 R\nthat if N n is a compact Riemannian manifold with\n\n+\n\nsuch that lim\u03b4\u21920 \u03a8(\u03b4, k, n) = 0 such\n\nrad(N n ) \u2265 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b4\n\n(8.12)\n\nL1/(2k) (M n ) \u2282 [0, \u01ebk ) \u222a (2\u03c0 \u2212 \u01ebk , 2\u03c0 + \u01ebk ) \u222a * * * (2k\u03c0 \u2212 \u01ebk , 2k\u03c0 + \u01ebk )\n\n(8.13)\n\nand Ricci(N n ) \u2265 (n \u2212 1) then\n\nfor \u01ebk = \u03a8(\u03b4, k, n).\nRemark 8.6 Note that Example 8.1 also has rad(Mi ) \u2192 rad(S 2 ), so here we also have no lower\nbound on injectivity radius and cannot directly conclude a stronger convergence of the length spectrum. See Problems 11.25 and 11.26.\nGromov proved that any Riemannian manifold M n with Ricci \u2265 0 and first Betti number\nsatisfying b1 (M ) = n is isometric to a torus [G1]. The corresponding stability theorem is hidden in\nn\nColding's proof that any M n with b1 (M n ) = n and Ricci \u2265 \u2212(n \u2212 1)\u01eb is homeomorphic to T if \u01eb\nis sufficiently small [Co3].\n18\n\n\fProposition 8.7 (Colding) For any \u01eb > 0 there exists \u03b4\u01eb > 0 such that if M n has b1 (M n ) = n\nand Ricci \u2265 \u2212(n \u2212 1)\u03b4\u01eb then\nn\ndGH (M n , T ) < \u01eb.\n(8.14)\nCombining this with Theorem 8.1 and the fact that\nn\n\nL1/(2k) (T ) =\n=\n\n{Lk1 , Lk2 , ...Lkm(k) }\nv\nu n\nuX\na2n : am = 0, 1, 2, ...k} \\ {0}\n{t\n\n(8.15)\n(8.16)\n\nm=1\n\nwe get the following:\nTheorem 8.4 For all \u01eb > 0, and any k \u2208 N, there exists \u03b4\u01eb,k > 0 such that if N n is a Riemannian\nmanifold with\nRicci(N n ) \u2265 \u2212(n \u2212 1)\u03b4\u01eb,k\n(8.17)\nand b1 (N n ) = n then then for all j \u2208 {0, 1, 2, ...m(k)} we have:\n\n[Lkj + \u01eb, Lkj+1 \u2212 \u01eb] \u2229 L1/(2k) (N ) = \u2205,\n\n(8.18)\n\nwhere 0 = Lk0 < Lk1 < Lk2 < ... is given in (8.15).\nIn Problems 11.27 and 11.28 we ask for relevant examples with arbitrarily small min L or disappearing lengths. Examples with injectivity radius approaching 0 have been described by Colding.\nOne begins by removing balls of radius 1/2 from a flat torus, gluing in very flat cones, and then\nsmoothly capping them off carefully to keep the injectivity radius exactly as in Example 8.1 and\nfinally smoothing the boundaries of the balls which adds the slightly negative curvature.\nRemark 8.8 In [So1], the author has proven another stability theorem, that a locally almost isotopic\nmanifold with Ricci \u2265 \u2212(n \u2212 1)H is Gromov-Hausdorff close to an isotopic manifold. When the\nmanifold is compact it close to a Riemannian manifold homothetic to a sphere. Thus we would also\nget a gap theorem for such a manifold. Since the definition of locally almost isotopic is complicated,\nwe do not give the complete explanation here. See Problem 11.29\n\n9\n\nOpenly 1/k Geodesics\n\nIn this section we define a new collection of geodesics and lengths which behaves a bit better than\n1/k geodesics on manifolds.\nDefinition 9.1 An openly 1/k geodesic \u03b3 : S 1 \u2192 M is a 1/k geodesic which has injrad(\u03b3) >\nL(\u03b3)/k.\nThe great advantage of an openly 1/k geodesic is the following lemma.\nLemma 9.1 If M is a compact Riemannian manifold and \u03b3 is an openly 1/k geodesic, then it\nis uniquely determined by any collection of k evenly spaced points up to reparametrization by an\nisometry of S 1 .\nProof: This follows from the fact that if \u03b3 is minimizing on [a, b] then it is uniquely determined on\n[a, c] for any c \u2208 (a, b) (c.f. [doC]).\n\n19\n\n\fLemma 9.1 does not hold on a compact length space:\nExample 9.1 Let Y be a graph with four ordered vertices, {v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 = v0 }, and two unit edges\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\ne+\ni and ei between vi and vi+1 for i = 0, 1, 2, 3. Let \u03b3 be the geodesic which traverses e1 , e2 , e3 ,\n\u2212\nand e4 . It is in fact a 1/2 geodesic and thus an openly 1/4 geodesic. However, it is not uniquely\ndetermined by the 4 evenly spaced points v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 as there is another geodesic sharing those points\n+\n\u2212\n+\nwhich traverses e\u2212\n1 , e2 , e3 , and e4 .\nLemma 9.1 does not hold if one only assumes \u03b3 is a 1/k geodesic instead of openly 1/k as we see\nin the next example:\nExample 9.2 If we take a Riemannian manifold depicted in Figure 4,\n3\n\nM\u01eb = \u2202T\u01eb ([\u22121, 1] \u00d7 [\u22121, 1] \u00d7 {0}) \u2282 E ,\n\n(9.1)\n\npj = ((1 + \u01eb)cos(j\u03c0/2), (1 + \u01eb)sin(j\u03c0/2), 0)\n\n(9.2)\n\nand choose the points\nthen we claim the piecewise geodesic, \u03b3, which runs minimally with positive z from p0 to p1 , negative\nz from p1 to p2 , positive z from p2 to p3 and negative z from p3 to p0 , is a 1/4 geodesic.\n\nFigure 4: Here we have two copies of M\u01eb . The geodesic \u03b3 is depicted on the right.\nTo prove we show that in fact \u03b3 is actually minimizing on [j\u03c0/2 \u2212 s, j\u03c0/2 + s] for any s < \u03c0/2.\nFirst note the z components of \u03b3(j\u03c0/2 \u2212 s) is the negative of \u03b3(j\u03c0/2 + s). So if \u03c3 runs minimally\nbetween these two points it must have an s0 where its z component is 0. By symmetry \u03c3(s0 ) must\nbe located at pj , thus \u03c3 must agree with \u03b3. So \u03b3 is actually minimizing between any t and t + 2\u03c0/4!\nNote that \u03b3 is also not uniquely determined by the pi because there is another geodesic which is\nthe reflection of \u03b3 through the xy plane running through the same four points also depicted on the\nleft in Figure 4.\nWe now develop the theory of openly 1/k geodesics.\nDefinition 9.2 Let Lopen\n1/k (M ) be the collection of lengths of openly 1/k geodesics.\nThe following lemma is an easy exercise:\nLemma 9.2 For any k > 2 we have\nL1/(k\u22121) (M ) \u2282 Lopen\n1/k \u2282 L1/k (M )\n\n(9.3)\n\nand Lopen\n1/2 (M ) = \u2205.\nIn particular there are no openly 1/2 geodesics. Lemma 9.2 combined with Theorem 3.1 immediately implies:\n20\n\n\fTheorem 9.1 On any compact length space, M ,\nL(M ) =\n\n\u221e\n[\n\nLopen\n1/k (M ).\n\n(9.4)\n\nk=3\n\nDefinition 9.3 Let the openly minimizing index, opind(\u03b3), of a geodesic, \u03b3, be the smallest k such\nthat \u03b3 is an openly 1/k geodesic.\nLet opind(M ) = min{opind(\u03b3) : \u03b3 : S 1 \u2192 M }.\nLemma 9.2 immediately implies:\nLemma 9.3\nminind(\u03b3) \u2264 opind(\u03b3) \u2264 minind(\u03b3) + 1.\n\n(9.5)\n\nNote that in the flat torus and in the sphere all closed geodesics have minind(\u03b3) < opind(\u03b3)\n[Examples 3.2 and 3.1]. Manifolds with this property are of significant interest because we are able\nto bound the open index in Theorems 10.2 and 10.3 below. See Problem 11.10.\nTheorem 7.1 and Lemma 9.2 together imply:\nTheorem 9.2 If Mj \u2192 M in the GH sense then\n\nlim Lopen\n1/k (Mj ) \u2282 L1/k (M ).\n\n(9.6)\n\nopen\nlim Lopen\n1/k (Mj ) \u2282 L1/k (M ).\n\n(9.7)\n\nj\u2192\u221e\n\nWe do cannot improve this to\nj\u2192\u221e\n\nas can be seen in the following example.\nExample 9.3 In Example 7.2 we demonstrated that the equators, \u03b3c , of flattening ellipsoids (x2 +\ny 2 + (z/c)2 = 1 had injrad(\u03b3c ) varying continuously with c and converging to 0 as c \u2192 0.\nWhen c = 1, minind(\u03b3) = 1/2 and injrad(\u03b3) = \u03c0. As c decreases, the injectivity radius decreases\ncontinuously [ItKi], and at some c0 > 0 the injectivity radius hits 2\u03c0/3 for the first time. So for all\nc > c0 , \u03b3c is an openly 1/3 geodesic but \u03b3c0 is not.\nSo if cj decrease to c0 ,\n(9.8)\n/ Lopen\nmin Lopen\n1/3 (Mc0 )\n1/3 (Mcj ) \u2208\nj\u2192\u221e\n\neven though Mcj converges to Mc0 in the C \u221e and Gromov-Hausdorff sense.\nIt is of some interest to understand what is special about 1/k geodesics which are not openly 1/k\ngeodesics. On such a geodesic, \u03b3, there is a pair of cut points which are a distance L(\u03b3)/k apart.\nProposition 9.4 If M is a compact Riemannian manifold with no conjugate points and \u03b3 is a 1/k\ngeodesic of length kinjrad(M ) which is not an openly 1/k geodesic then either k = 2 or \u03b3 is the\niterate of a 1/2 geodesic and k is even,\nProof: If \u03b3 : S 1 \u2192 M is a 1/k geodesic which is not an openly 1/k geodesic, then it has a pair of\ncut points on it which are a distance L(\u03b3)/k apart. If L(\u03b3)/k = injrad(M ) and M has no conjugate\npoints, then by Klingenberg's Lemma 6.2, these two points are joined by exactly two geodesics\nwhich close up smoothly, thus either k = 2 or \u03b3 is an iterated geodesic \u03b3(t) = \u03b30 (kt/2) with k even.\nFurthermore \u03b30 is a 1/2 geodesic because d(\u03b30 (t), \u03b30 (t + \u03c0)) \u2265 injrad(M ) = L(\u03b30 )/2.\nProposition 9.4 is not true on metric spaces.\n\nExample 9.4 Let M be the metric space which is a graph with two vertices and three unit length\nedges each running from one vertex to the other. Then injrad(M ) = 1 and any path which runs\nback and forth between the endpoints with constant speed and never traverses back on the edge it\njust crossed over is a geodesic. Thus for any k \u2208 N M has many prime 1/(2k) geodesics of length\n2kinjrad(M ).\n21\n\n\f10\n\nEnergy and Openly 1/k Geodesics\n\nHere we introduce an energy method which may be used to prove the existence of a 1/k geodesic on\na given space with certain properties, thus allowing one to estimate minind(M ) and thus min L(M )\nvia Theorem 6.1 and Lemma 9.3.\nIn this section we limit ourselves to convex compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary so\nthat we can discuss the derivative of a geodesic. The convexity assumption guarantees the geodesics\nwon't touch the boundary. Background material may be found in [BTZ] and [Mil].\nSmoothly closed geodesics are the critical points of the energy function on the loop space of M :\nZ 1\nE(c) =\ng(c\u2032 (t), c\u2032 (t)) dt\n(10.1)\n0\n\nIt is easy to see that when we have a critical point of this energy, one gets a smoothly closed geodesic.\nFurthermore if c is a smoothly closed geodesic and is known to be minimizing on subintervals [ti , ti+1 ]\nthen the energy satisfies:\nN\nX\nd(\u03b3(ti+1 ), \u03b3(ti ))2 /(ti+1 \u2212 ti ).\n(10.2)\nE(\u03b3) =\ni=1\n\nSo if \u03b3 is a 1/k geodesic, then\nE(\u03b3) =\n\nk\u22121\nX\n\nd(\u03b3((i + 1)/k), \u03b3(i/k))2 /(1/k).\n\n(10.3)\n\ni=0\n\nIn Morse Theory one uses a uniform lower bound on injectivity radius and makes a finite dimensional approximation of the loop space. That is any smoothly closed geodesic of length \u2264 L can be\nviewed as a critical point in\n\u03a9k (M ) \u2282 (M )k = M \u00d7 M \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 M\n\n(10.4)\n\n\u03a9k (M ) = {(x1 , ..xk ) : d(xi , xi+1 ) \u2264 i0 }.\n\n(10.5)\n\nwhere\nof the energy function\nE(x1 , ...xk ) =\n\nk\nX\n\nd(xi , xi+1 )2 /(1/k)\n\n(10.6)\n\ni=0\n\nwhere k \u2265 L/i0. Once one finds the xi which give a critical value, you join them by the unique\ngeodesic segments between them to get a loop and prove that this loop is a smoothly closed geodesic.\nIn particular one has the following old theorem:\nTheorem 10.1 [c.f. [Mil]] If M is a manifold, given a set of length segements ri \u2208\ndefine\nk\nX\nd(xi , xi+1 )2 /ri\nE{r1 ,r2 ,...rk } (x1 , ...xk ) =\n\nR+ we can\n(10.7)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere xk+1 = x1 . Then (y1 , ...yk ) is a smooth critical point of E : (M )k \u2192 R iff for all i \u2208 {1, 2, ...k}\nwe have:\nd(xi , xi+1 )/ri = d(xi\u22121 , xi )/ri\u22121\n(10.8)\nand\n\u2207\u03c1xi+1 = \u2212\u2207\u03c1xi\u22121 at xi ,\nwhere \u03c1x (y) = d(x, y).\n22\n\n(10.9)\n\n\fNote that \u2207\u03c1x is not defined at cut points of x. Here however, we avoided this issue by explicitly\nstating that we are at a smooth critical point.\nIn particular, if we study E = E1/k,1/k,1/k,...1/k on \u03a9k , it is a smooth function when it's values\nare less than L. So all of its critical points below k 2 L2 , are smooth geodesics which are minimizing\nbetween k evenly spaced points.\n3\n\n2\n\nExample 10.1 Let M\u01eb = \u2202T\u01eb (Y ) \u2282 E where Y is a flat solid regular square in E \u00d7 {0} as in\nExample 7.3. For \u01eb sufficiently small we can see that the geodesic running around the equator looks\nalmost like a square and is the critical point of the energy in (10.6) for k = 4 when the xi are near\nthe vertices of the square. However, it is not a minimizing geodesic between the midpoints of the\nsides, and so it is not a 1/4 geodesic.\nNevertheless we would like to use Theorem 10.1 to identify the openly 1/k geodesics. First, we\ndo not restrict ourselves to \u03a9k using an injectivity radius, nor do we restrict the values of the energy.\nThis allows us to search for long and short openly 1/k geodesics.\nDefinition 10.1 Let E = E1/k,1/k,...1/k : (M )k \u2192 R be called the uniform energy.\nCorollary 10.1 For any openly 1/k geodesic \u03b3 : S 1 \u2192 M and any t \u2208 S 1 the point\n(\u03b3(t), \u03b3(t + 2\u03c0/k), \u03b3(t + 4\u03c0/k), ...\u03b3(t \u2212 \u03c0/k)) \u2208 (M )k\n\n(10.10)\n\nis a smooth critical point of the uniform energy on M k . As we run through all values of t we get a\ncritical level set, which is itself a closed geodesic in (M )k .\nBefore we set up the converse, we add a short lemma about geodesics generated by critical points.\nLemma 10.2 If x\u0304 = (x1 , ...xk ) \u2208 (M )k is a smooth critical point of the uniform energy E : M k \u2192\nR, then it defines a unique closed geodesic, \u03b3x\u0304 , which runs minimally between the cyclic permutations (x1 , x2 , ...xk ), (x2 , x3 , ...xk , x1 ), (x3 , ...xk , x1 , x2 ) and finally back through (xk , x1 , ...xk\u22121 ) to\n(x1 , ...xk ).\nProof: We know from Theorem 10.1 that if x\u0304 is a critical point we get a unique geodesic \u03b3 : S 1 \u2192 M\nrunning through x1 , x2 , and on through xk and back to x1 . So we can just take\n\u03b3\u0304(t) = (\u03b3(t), \u03b3(t + 2\u03c0/k), ...\u03b3(t + (k \u2212 1)\u03c0/k)).\n\n(10.11)\n\nDefinition 10.2 If x\u0304 is a smooth critical point such that every point on \u03b3x\u0304 is also a smooth critical\npoint, then we say x\u0304 is a rotating smooth critical point and \u03b3x\u0304 is a rotating smooth critical set.\nTheorem 10.2 Openly 1/k geodesics in a convex compact Riemannian manifold with boundary, M ,\nhave a one to one correspondance with rotating smooth critical points of the uniform energy in (M )k\nof nonzero value.\nProof: This pretty much follows from Theorem 10.1, Corollary 10.1 and Lemma 10.2.\nCorollary 10.3 Given a manifold M , it's open index, opind(M ), is the smallest value k such that\nuniform energy E : M k \u2192 R has a rotating smooth critical point with a nonzero value.\n\n23\n\n\fExample 10.2 Suppose we use this approach to study the length spectrum of S 1 . First we verify\n1\nthat Lopen\n1/2 (S ) = \u2205 because\nE(s, t) = 4(|s \u2212 t| mod 2\u03c0)2 = 4(s \u2212 t)2 mod 16\u03c0 2\n\n(10.12)\n\n1\nhas only (0, 0) as a smooth critical point. For Lopen\n1/3 (S ) = {2\u03c0} we examine\n\nE(s, t, r) = 3(|s \u2212 t| mod 2\u03c0)2 + 3(|t \u2212 r| mod 2\u03c0)2 + 3(|r \u2212 s| mod 2\u03c0)2\n\n(10.13)\n\nThis energy is smooth as long as |s \u2212 t| =\n6 2k\u03c0, |t \u2212 r| =\n6 2k\u03c0 and |r \u2212 s| =\n6 2k\u03c0. For (s0 , t0 , r0 ) in\nthis domain, there are values k1 , k2 , k3 \u2208 Z such that for all (s, t, r) near (so , t0 , r0 ) we have:\n(s \u2212 t) mod 2\u03c0\n\n(t \u2212 r) mod 2\u03c0\n(r \u2212 s) mod 2\u03c0\n\n=\n=\n=\n\ns \u2212 t + 2k1 \u03c0\n\nt \u2212 r + 2k2 \u03c0\nr \u2212 s + 2k3 \u03c0\n\n(10.14)\n(10.15)\n(10.16)\n\nso\nE(s, t, r) = 3(s \u2212 t + 2k1 \u03c0)2 + 3(t \u2212 r + k2 \u03c0)2 + 3(r \u2212 s + k3 \u03c0)2\n\n(10.17)\n\nThus we can differentiate and get:\n0 = \u2202E/\u2202s =\n\n2(s \u2212 t + 2k1 \u03c0) \u2212 2(r \u2212 s + 2k2 \u03c0)\n\n(10.18)\n\n0 = \u2202E/\u2202t = \u22122(s \u2212 t + 2k2 \u03c0) + 2(t \u2212 r + 2k3 \u03c0)\n0 = \u2202E/\u2202r = \u22122(t \u2212 r + 2k3 \u03c0) + 2(r \u2212 s + 2k1 \u03c0)\n\n(10.19)\n(10.20)\n\nh = (s \u2212 t) mod 2\u03c0 = (t \u2212 r) mod 2\u03c0 = (r \u2212 s) mod 2\u03c0.\n\n(10.21)\n\nwhich implies that\n\nSince 3hmod 2\u03c0 = 0 we know our smooth critical points have the form (s, s, s) or (s, s + 2\u03c0/3, s +\n4\u03c0/3) or (s, s + 4\u03c0/3, s + 2\u03c0/3). This gives us two nonzero rotating critical points whose energy is\n1\n9(2\u03c0/3)2 = 4\u03c0 2 , so their length is 2\u03c0. Thus Lopen\n1/3 = {2\u03c0}. Thus openind(S ) = 3.\nUsing a similar analysis of other compact length spaces one should be able to impose lower\nbounds on their minimizing index [Problem 11.16].\nLusternick and Fet proved the existence of closed geodesics on an arbitrary compact Riemannian\nmanifold by producing critical points of the energy functional. Such critical points are produced\nusing Morse Theory and the topological properties of the product space. It is much more difficult\nto prove the existance of rotating critical points. [Problem 11.15] In fact, not all compact length\nspaces have closed geodesics.\nExample 10.3 Let X = [0, 1] with the standard metric d(s, t) = |s \u2212 t|. Then for any k \u2208 N, we\nstudy\nk\nX\nk(sj \u2212 sj+1 )2 where sk+1 = s1 .\n(10.22)\nE(s1 , s2 , ...sk ) =\nj=1\n\nk\n\nThis is a smooth function on (0, 1) \u2282 [0, 1]k , and its critical points satisfy\nsj\u22121 \u2212 sj = sj \u2212 sj+1 for j = 1, ...k.\n\n(10.23)\n\nSince we are not on a circle, these points cannot wrap around, so (10.23) implies that all the sj = 0.\nThus there are no smooth critical points and by Theorem 10.2 X = [0, 1] has no openly 1/k geodesics\nfor any k and by Theorem 9.1 it has no closed geodesics at all.\n24\n\n\fIn a similar manner Theorems 10.2 and 9.1 could be used to prove other compact length spaces\nhave no closed geodesics. [Problem 11.1]\nRemark 10.4 Naturally, one would like to extend Theorem 10.2 to obtain some method of detecting\na 1/k geodesic which is not openly 1/k. To do so, one might consider selecting nonsmooth critical\npoints using techniques from Grove-Shiohama's critical points of distance function or Chang's critical\npoints of Lipschitz functions [GrShio] [Cng].\nUsing such techniques one would detect the 1/4 geodesic in Example 9.2 (see Figure 4. That is\nthe point (p0 , p1 , p2 , p3 ) \u2282 (M\u01eb )4 defined using the pi in Example 9.2 is such a nonsmooth critical\npoint.\nSimilarly, if one were to take a tubular neighborhood of a solid pentagon, Y , in the xy plane\ninstead of a square as in Figure 5 and look at five evenly spaced points, xj , on the equator near the\nmidpoints of the sides of the pentagon, then one would again get a nonsmooth critical point in the\nsense of Chang or of Grove-Shiohama.\nHowever, if we let \u03b3 run minimally with positive z from x0 to x1 and minimally from x1 to\nx2 , one could verify it was running minimally from \u03b3(t) to \u03b3(t + d(x0 , x1 )), just like the squarelike\ngeodesic in Example 9.2. However, if we continue to extend \u03b3 in this manner alternating above and\nbelow, it returns to \u03b3(0) from above creating a corner! So there is no geodesic corresponding to this\nnonsmooth critical point, although it is halfway around a 1/10 geodesic.\nThe author proposes in Problem 11.17 to study nonsmooth critical points.\n\nFigure 5: The points xi \u2208 Y correspond to a critical point (x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) of the uniform energy\nfunction on (Y )5 . The geodesic \u03b3 here is approaching x0 from above.\nRemark 10.5 An advantage of focusing on smooth critical points is that we can discuss the Hessian of the energy and degeneracy. Naturally each openly 1/k geodesic is a degenerate critical point\nbecause of the fact that there is an entire critical level \u03b3x\u0304 . However, a closed geodesic is said to be \"degenerate\" iff the |detHess\u22a5 E| = 0 where we focus on the directions perpendicular to this rotational\ndegeneracy. Such geodesics have smoothly closed Jacobi fields perpendicular to \u03b3 \u2032 . [BTZ][GlMy]\nIn fact, there should be a stronger more global statement describing an openly 1/k geodesic which\ncorresponds to a nondegenerate critical point of E : M k \u2192 R [Problem 11.18].\nOn smooth\nRiemannian manifolds the Morse index is the index of the Hessian of the energy of a\nR\ngeodesic, |\u03b3 \u2032 (t)|2 dt. In particular, index of a closed geodesic, denoted ind(\u03b3), is the dimension of\nthe subspace of smooth closed vector fields perpendicular to \u03b3 \u2032 , V\u03bb , on which H is negative definite,\nwhere\nZ\n2\u03c0\n\nH(X, Y ) =\n\n0\n\n< \u2207X, \u2207Y > \u2212 < R(X, \u03b3 \u2032 (t))\u03b3 \u2032 (t), Y > dt.\n\n(10.24)\n\nMorse proved that for geodesic segments, where the vector fields have no assumption on periodity,\nthe index bounds the number of conjugate points on a segment. Closed Geodesics have been studied\nby Klingenberg and Ballman-Thorgbergson-Ziller, relating their index to the Poincare Map [K2]\n[BTZ].\n25\n\n\fIt is important to emphasize here that the Morse Index is defined using vector fields and a\ncovariant derivative and thus is not naturally extended to compact length spaces. Even when viewed\nas a Hession of an energy on the loop space there is a significant difficult defining an extension of\nthe concept. Finally, the Poincare Map and even the unique extension of a geodesic is not defined\non arbitrary compact length space.\nTheorem 10.3 The Morse Index of a geodesic, \u03b3, in a compact Riemannian manifold satisfies:\nind(\u03b3) \u2264 (n \u2212 1)(opind(\u03b3)).\n\n(10.25)\n\nind(\u03b3) \u2264 (n \u2212 1)(minind(\u03b3) + 1).\n\n(10.26)\n\nProof: Since (10.25) and Lemma 9.3 imply (10.26), we can concentrate on an openly 1/k geodesic,\n\u03b3.\nLet tj = 2\u03c0j/k for j = 0 to k \u2212 1. Following [BTZ], we have V\u039b equal to the direct sum of V\u039b1\nand V\u039b2 where V\u039b1 are piecewise Jacobi along this partition and V\u039b2 are smooth vector fields = 0 on\nthe partition. They are orthogonal with respect to H and H is positive definite on V\u039b2 because the\ngeodesic is minimal between the points on the partition. Note that the crucial point is that we do\nnot use the injectivity radius here. Instead the number of points in the partition depends on the\nopenly minimizing index of \u03b3. This immediately proves that the Morse Index of \u03b3 satisfies:\nind(\u03b3) \u2264 dimV\u039b1 = (n \u2212 1)k.\n\n(10.27)\n\nExample 10.4 A 1/k geodesic may have Morse index 0 no matter how large k is, as can be seen\nin spaces with nonpositive sectional curvature, like a torus, which have no conjugate points.\nRemark 10.6 The crucial difference between the Morse Index and the minimizing index of a closed\ngeodesic is that the Morse index is a purely local concept while the minimizing index is a global\nconcept checking for cut as well as conjugate points.\nIt would be interesting to investigate whether the minimizing index of an openly 1/k geodesic is\nrelated to the Hessian of the uniform energy in Theorem 10.2 [Problem 11.19].\nRemark 10.7 Now if Mi converge to M in the C 4 sense their finite dimensional loop spaces Mik\nconverge in the C 4 sense. It is not hard to show (c.f. [Cnly]) that a suddenly appearing critical\npoint under C 4 convergence must be degenerate. Thus it is of significant interest to identify these\nnondegenerate openly 1/k geodesics.\nRemark 10.8 One might be tempted to prove that the nondegenerate length spectrum is a continuous\nfunction of smoothly converging manifolds. However, this can be seen not to be the case in Figure 2\nsince although the nondegenerate length spectrum of the Mi does converge to the nondegenerate\nlength spectrum of Y , there is a sequence of nondegenerate geodesics in the Ni converging to the\ndegenerate geodesic in Y . In fact, Klingenberg proved that any geodesic can be made into a limit of\nnondegenerate geodesics of a sequence of C 4 close metrics on the manifold [K2]. Conley showed that\nif the geodesic is degenerate then the sequence approaching it must have a cancelling set of geodesics\njust as in Figure 2 [Cnly].\n\n11\n\nOpen Problems\n\nIn this section we state some open problems, many of which were mentioned earlier in the paper. If\nyou wish to work on one of these problems or have solved one, please let the author know.\n26\n\n\fProblem 11.1 What compact length spaces have empty length spectra? Luisternik and Fet proved\nthat on any compact Riemannian manifold there exist closed geodesics by proving the existence of\ncritical points of the energy functional on the loop space (c.f. [Cr]). Here we need more than\njust critical points, so it would be easier to prove some spaces have empty length spectra using\nTheorem 10.2 in a manner similar to Example 10.3.\nProblem 11.2 Are there upper bounds on min L1/k (M ) which depend on volume rather than diameter? See also Problem 11.7.\nProblem 11.3 Find a compact manifold, M , whose shortest closed geodesic has a larger minimizing\nindex than the manifold.\nProblem 11.4 Note that Klingenberg's Lemma implies that the minimizing index of any manifold\nwithout conjugate points is 2 [Corollary 6.3] . This includes all manifolds with sectional curvature \u2264\n0. What can one say about the minimizing index of a CAT(0) spaces? Suggestions for Problem 11.16\nmay help.\nProblem 11.5 Is there an appropriate definition for a conjugate point on a compact length space\nwhich will give results as strong as Corollary 6.3? One might look at [So1], which has a definition\nof conjugate point defined for an entirely different situation. Keep Example 9.4 in mind.\nProblem 11.6 Can one use the proofs of Rotman and Nabutovsky-Rotman's results to provide\nbounds on min L1/k (M )? See Proposition 5.5 nor 5.6.\nProblem 11.7 Try to extend the volume estimates on min L1/2 given in Propositions 5.4, 5.3, 5.2\nand 5.5 to compact length spaces with finite second Hausdorff measure. It would not be expected that\nthe results would follow without some additional conditions. See Remark 5.7.\nProblem 11.8 What properties can be placed on a simply connected manifold to guarantee the\nexistence of a 1/2 geodesic? Note that Theorem 10.2 cannot be used to find a 1/2 geodesic but\nProblem 11.17 might prove helpful.\nProblem 11.9 What properties can be placed on a manifold to allow one to estimate its minimizing\nindex? See Problem 11.16 for one possible approach.\nProblem 11.10 In Lemma 9.3 we related the open index to the minimizing index of a geodesic. On\nthe standard sphere the difference between these indices is exactly 1 for all geodesics. What other\nmanifolds share this property? [c.f. and Theorem 10.2].\nProblem 11.11 Is there a version of Proposition 6.1 which involves the volume rather than the\ndiameter of the manifold?\nProblem 11.12 What happens in the equality case for Proposition 6.1?\nProblem 11.13 On a manifold with minimizing index, minind(M ) = k, is there an exact bound\non min L(M ) which depends on k?\nProblem 11.14 If Mi converge to S 2 with the standard metric in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense,\nand they have a common lower bound on their injectivity radius, injrad(Mi ) \u2265 i0 > 0, then do all\nprime geodesics \u03b3i : S 1 \u2192 Mi satisfy Bangert's Theorem that L(\u03b3i ) either converge to 2\u03c0 or diverge\nto infinity? See Remark 7.4.\n\n27\n\n\fProblem 11.15 Many theorems proving the existence of a closed geodesic on a manifold involve the\nstudy of the Morse Theory of the loop space and the existence of critical point on that loop space. To\nproduce a 1/k geodesic, Theorem 10.2 requires that we find a \"rotating\" critical point of an energy on\na product space. What conditions can be placed on a manifold or metric space to prove the existence\nof such a critical point?\nProblem 11.16 Estimate the minimizing index of a compact length space or provide a lower bound\non the minimizing index using Theorem 10.2. See Example 10.2 for a simple case. Such an estimate\nwould then provide an estimate on minind(M ) and thus min L(M ) via Theorem 6.1 and Lemma 9.3.\nProblem 11.17 In Theorem 10.2, we relate openly 1/k geodesics on a compact Riemannian manifold M to special smooth critical points of an energy on M k = M \u00d7 M \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 M . It would be\ninteresting to study whether some definition for a nonsmooth critical point might be used that relates\nto 1/k geodesics. See Remark 10.4. This might help solve Problem 11.8.\nProblem 11.18 A degenerate closed geodesic is a geodesic whose energy functional is degenerate.\nIt has been proven to have a smoothly closed Jacobi field in [BTZ][GlMy]. Is there a similar more\nglobal property concerning nearby geodesics for a degenerate openly 1/k geodesic where one defines\ndegenerate using the Hessian of the uniform energy? See Remarks 10.5, 10.7 and 10.8.\nProblem 11.19 Does the index of the Hessian of the uniform energy provide an estimate on the\nminimizing index? It would be interesting to investigate whether the minimizing index of an openly\n1/k geodesic is related to the Hessian of the uniform energy in Theorem 10.2. See Remark 10.6.\nProblem 11.20 In Theorem 1.1, we estimate the location of the length spectrum of a Riemannian\nmanifold, N n , whose volume is close to that of the sphere and whose Ricci curvature is bounded from\nbelow. Can one find an explicit formula for the estimating function, \u03a8? How strong is its dependance\non k? Can one control L(N n ) and not just L1/k ? Note that Colding's Volume Theorem [Co1] does\nnot give a precise estimate on the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and getting one from his proof\nwould be very difficult. However, proving this result directly may be possible. See Remark 8.3.\nProblem 11.21 Find a sequence of manifolds Mjn with Ricci \u2265 (n \u2212 1), V ol(Mjn ) \u2192 V ol(S n ) such\nthat min L(Mjn ) \u2192 0 or prove this cannot occur. Note in Example 8.1 we showed there is no uniform\nlower bound on injectivity radius implies by the Ricci and volume conditions.\nProblem 11.22 Find a sequence of manifolds Mjn with Ricci \u2265 (n \u2212 1), V ol(Mjn ) \u2192 V ol(S n ) with\nLj \u2208 L(Mj ) such that Lj \u2192 L\u221e \u2208\n/ L(S 2 ) or prove this cannot occur. Note that by Theorem 1.1 we\nknow the \u03b3j of length Lj have minind(\u03b3j ) \u2192 \u221e. It is quite possible that the Mj in Example 8.1\nhave disappearing geodesics, so these surfaces are worth investigation. One might begin by stretching\nelastic loops around footballs in a clever way.\nProblem 11.23 Is it possible to get a gap theorem for manifolds with Ricci \u2265 (n \u2212 1) and diameter\nclose to \u03c0? See Remark 8.4.\nProblem 11.24 Given a length space X what can one say about the length spectrum of the spherical\nsuspension over X? See [BBI] for a rigorous definition of a spherical suspension.\nProblem 11.25 Find a sequence of manifolds Mjn with Ricci \u2265 (n \u2212 1), rad(Mjn ) \u2192 rad(S n ) such\nthat min L(Mjn ) \u2192 0 or prove this cannot occur. See Remark 8.6.\nProblem 11.26 Find a sequence of manifolds Mjn with Ricci \u2265 (n \u2212 1), rad(Mjn ) \u2192 rad(S n ) with\nLj \u2208 L(Mj ) such that Lj \u2192 L\u221e \u2208\n/ L(S 2 ) or prove this cannot occur. Note that by Theorem 8.3 we\nknow the \u03b3j of length Lj have minind(\u03b3j ) \u2192 \u221e.\n28\n\n\fProblem 11.27 Find a sequence of manifolds Mjn with Ricci \u2265 \u2212\u01ebj (n \u2212 1) \u2192 0, and b1 (M n ) = n\nsuch that min L(Mjn ) \u2192 0 or prove this cannot occur. See Theorem 8.4.\nProblem 11.28 ]. Find a sequence of manifolds Mjn with Ricci \u2265 \u2212\u01ebj (n\u22121) \u2192 0, and b1 (M n ) = n\nsuch that such that Lj \u2192 L\u221e \u2208\n/ L(S 2 ) or prove this cannot occur. Note that by Theorem 8.4 we\nknow the \u03b3j of length Lj have minind(\u03b3j ) \u2192 \u221e.\nProblem 11.29 Analyze the length spectra of locally almost isotopic manifolds mentioned in Remark 8.8.\nProblem 11.30 In Section 8 we explained how some rigidity theorems with extremal diameters,\nvolumes or eigenvalues relative to Ricci curvature bounds have stability statements. Propositions 5.2,\n5.3 and 5.4 do not involve Ricci curvature but do have rigidity results when their equalities have been\nachieved. Do they have related stability or stability theorems? Without the Ricci curvature bounds\none wouldn't expect these theorems to involve Gromov-Hausdorff convergence.\n\nReferences\n[BTZ]\n\nW. Ballmann, G. Thorbergsson and W.
