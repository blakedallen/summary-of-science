INTRODUCTION\n\nThe first generation of stars in the Universe are expected to be metal-free. If some of these stars have lifetimes of a Hubble time, metal-free stars would be currently found in the Milky Way. Hunting metal-free stars,\ni.e., Population III (Pop III) stars, is an important goal\nof contemporary astronomy, and extensive searches for\nextremely low-metallicity stars are underway [e.g. The\nHamburg/ESO R-process-Enhanced Star (HERES) survey, and the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Evolution (SEGUE); see Beers & Christlieb 2005\nfor an overview of past and current surveys]. To date,\nsurveys have been primarily in the solar neighborhood,\nwhich has the obvious advantage over the bulge of proximity, as well as lacking the dust extinction and crowding. Searches also target the outer halo, which retains the\nlatter two advantages. Currently, only 12 stars with iron\nabundances [Fe/H] < \u22123.5 have been identified (Beers &\nChristlieb 2005), with the lowest having [Fe/H] = \u22125.4\n(Frebel et al. 2005). Thus far, however, there is no report of the detection of a single star that does not contain\nany metals. Therefore, one crucial question is raised: is\nthe current survey area the right place to look for the\nmetal-free stars?\nRecently, Diemand, Madau, & Moore (2005) used\n1 D\u00e9partement de physique, de g\u00e9nie physique et d'optique, Universit\u00e9 Laval, Qu\u00e9bec, QC, Canada G1K 7P4\n2 Dept. of Astronomy, University of Washington, Box 351580,\nSeattle, WA 98195, USA\n3 The Observatories of the Carnegie Institution of Washington,\n813 Santa Barbara St., Pasadena, CA 91101\n4 Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn VIC 3122, Australia\n5 Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kohn Hall, UC Santa\nBarbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106\n6 Centre for Astrophysics, University of Central Lancashire, Preston, PR1 2HE, United Kingdom\n\nhigh-resolution N-body simulations to trace the positions\nof the particles contained in the protogalactic halos collapsing from 3.0\u03c3 and 3.5\u03c3 density perturbations. Tracing particles in 3.0\u03c3 perturbations, they found that the\ndensity of such particles in the solar neighborhood is\nthree orders of magnitude lower than in the bulge at\nz = 0. Moreover, tracing particles in 3.5\u03c3 perturbations leads to even more extreme results, decreasing the\nnumber of these particles at the solar radius by almost\nanother order of magnitude. This implies that the Milky\nWay's bulge is the best place to search for the very oldest\nstars and their remnants. Therefore, if Pop III and the\noldest stars are one and the same, the non-detection of\nPop III stars may simply be due to the surveys looking\nin the wrong place, and future surveys should focus on\nthe bulge region.\nHowever, the link between the oldest stars, metal poor\nstars, and metal-free Pop III stars is not so straight forward. The largest halos, forming in the greatest density\nperturbations, can progress their self-enrichment, and\nproduce the next generation of stars, at very high redshift. Combining semi-analytic galaxy formation recipes\nof Kauffmann et al. (1999) with N-body simulations of\ngalaxy clusters, rescaled to Milky Way mass, White &\nSpringel (2000) showed that the oldest stars are distributed preferentially at small radii, while low metallicity stars (simply assumed to form in the lowest mass halos) lie preferentially at larger radii in the present Milky\nWay. This effect is driven by the flatter density profile\nof low \u03c3 peaks, compared to high \u03c3 peaks as shown, for\nexample, at z = 12 in figure 2 of Moore et al. (2005), and\nassuming the well established galaxy mass-metallicity relation. However, the association of low metallicity stars\nwith low mass halos does not necessarly mean that the\nearliest stars in these halos formed from primordial material. The low metallicity of dwarf galaxies may be\n\n\f2\ndue to factors caused by inefficient star formation Kennicut (1998), feedback driven outflow of the enriched\ngas, because of their shallow potential well Dekel & Silk\n(1986), or inflow of low metallicity material (K\u00f6ppen\n& Edmunds (1999). This may occur even if the earliest\nstars in such halos form from (slightly) enriched gas. But\nthese studies [see also an analytical argument by MiraldaEscud\u00e9 (2000)] do raise the possibility that Pop III stars\nhave a different radial distribution from the oldest stars,\ni.e. it is possible that low-density, isolated regions may\nform stars from primordial material at (relatively) low\nredshift.\nTo identify the best location to look for Pop III stars,\nit is necessary to infuse the dark matter structure formation studies employed in White & Springel (2000)\nand Diemand, Madau, & Moore (2005) with information\npertaining to the metal enrichment of the intergalactic\nmedium. In Scannapieco et al. (2006) (hereafter Paper I),\nwe combined a high-resolution N-body simulation of the\nformation of the Milky Way with a semi-analytic model\nof metal enrichment. This model traced the outflows induced by star formation in the collapsing halos identified\nin the N-body simulation, and tagged the metal-free star\nparticles that were born in halos massive enough to make\nstars, but isolated enough to not have been enriched by\noutflows from neighboring halos. We found that Pop III\nstars were formed over a large redshift range, that peaked\nat z \u2248 10, but continued to form down to z \u2248 5. Tracing these particles to their final locations at z = 0, we\nfound that the Pop III distribution covered a wide range\nof galactocentric radii.\nA limitation of this approach, however, is the assumption used for tracing baryonic matter, with the density\nprofile of stellar matter assumed to be the same as that\nfor the dark matter. In this paper (Paper II), we use a\ndifferent approach: chemo-dynamical simulations. Continued advances in computer technology and numerical\nmethods have made it possible to calculate the dynamical\nand chemical evolution of disk galaxies self-consistently\n(e.g. Bekki & Chiba 2001; Abadi et al. 2003; Nakasato\n& Nomoto 2003; Brook et al. 2004; Steinmetz & Muller\n1995; Scannapieco et al. 2005). Such chemo-dynamical\nsimulations can tell us the location of stars with different metallicities and ages at different redshifts. In\nthis paper, we use such information from cosmological\nchemo-dynamical simulations of Milky-Way analogues to\nstudy the birthplace and final distribution of the zerometallicity stars as well as very old stars. While working\nat a somewhat lower resolution than in Paper I, this approach nevertheless has the advantage of self-consistently\ntracing the details of star formation and metal enrichment within dynamical, hierarchical structure formation.\nIn particular, we examine four simulations of Milky-Waytype galaxies which employ various implementations of\nsupernovae (SNe) feedback, different resolutions, and different random initial density fluctuations. Interestingly,\nwe find that the resulting distributions of the oldest and\nzero-metallicity stars are consistent among the four simulations, robust within our different models.\nIn \u00a72 we introduce the code and models which we employ. In \u00a73 we show the star formation histories of the\nzero-metallicity \"metal-free\" stars. We then show the\ndistribution of such stars, as well as the distribution of\nvery \"oldest\" stars, the earliest stars forming in each sim-\n\nulation. A summary of our results and our conclusions\nfollow in \u00a74.\n2. METHOD\n2.1. The Disk Galaxy Simulation Models\n\nWe simulate four Milky-Way-analogue galaxies using the chemo-dynamical software GCD+, which selfconsistently models the effects of gravity, gas dynamics,\nradiative cooling, and star formation (Kawata & Gibson\n2003). Two of the models, AFM and TFM, have identical initial conditions but different prescriptions for modeling the SNe feedback. The other two models, KGCD\nand AGCD, are higher resolution disk galaxy formation\nmodels used in Bailin et al. (2005). We apply the same\nanalysis for all four models with varying evolution histories, prescriptions of star formation and supernovae\n(SNe) feedback, in order to test the robustness of our\nconclusions.\nAll models adopt \u039b-dominated CDM cosmological\nsimulations that use the multi-mass technique to selfconsistently model the large-scale tidal field, while simulating the galactic disk at high resolution. The initial\nconditions used for AFM and TFM corresponds to galaxy\nD1 of Kawata, Gibson, & Windhorst (2004), but in this\nsimulation, we set the high-resolution region to be 8 times\nthe virial radius of this galaxy at z = 0. The initial condition of AFM, TFM, and KGCD are constructed with\nGRAFIC2 (Bertschinger 2001) and that of AGCD is the\nsame as Abadi et al. (2003) which is kindly provided by\nM. Steinmetz. All initial conditions have been shown\nto lead to disk galaxies. Detail description about these\nmodels is seen in these earlier papers. Here, we provide\na brief description of these models.\nIn TFM, KGCD, and AGCD, we employ the exactly\nsame recipe as Kawata & Gibson (2003). In these models, 1050 erg energy is fed back as thermal energy from\neach SN, and energy from SNe II and SNe Ia is smoothed\nover surrounding gas particles according to SPH kernel, in the form of thermal energy, as in Katz (1992).\nThis SNe feedback model is often called thermal feedback model. On the other hand, AFM adopts the adiabatic feedback model introduced in Brook et al. (2004).\nIn this model, to maximize the effect of SNe feedback, we\nassume 1051 erg energy per SN. In addition, gas within\nthe SPH smoothing kernel of SNe II explosions is prevented from cooling. This adiabatic phase is assumed to\nlast for the lifetime of the lowest mass star that ends as\na SN II, i.e., the lifetime of 8 M\u2299 star (\u223c 100 Myr). The\nenergy released by SNe Ia, which do not so closely trace\nthe starburst region, is not assumed to have an adiabatic\nphase.\nThus, with our four models we have three different random seed initial conditions, with two different feedback\nformalisms, and run at three different resolutions. Table 1 summarizes the parameters of all the simulations.\nAll the models assume the Salpeter initial mass function\n(IMF) with the mass range of 0.1\u221260 M\u2299 . If the IMF for\nearly generation stars are different from the conventional\nSalpeter IMF, with more massive stars as suggested in\nthe numerical simluations, the total effect of SNe feedback may be stronger than in our simulations. This may\nreduce the number of the old and/or metal-free stars.\nTherefore, the absolute mass density of these stars in\nour simulations needs to be taken with caution. How-\n\n\f3\never, the main aim of this study is to identify the best\nplace to look for the metal-free stars, if they still exist.\nThus the important result we want to highlight is the radial distribution rather than the absolute density of the\nmetal free stars. This aspect of our result will only be\ninvalidated if the increased feedback were to greatly effect the enrichment of the IGM, such that isolated halos\nform from pre-enriched rather than primordial material.\nIn the parameter space survey in Paper I, the strength\nof that approach was its ability to probe this aspect of\nthe problem for a large range of feedback energies, assuming a variety of top heavy IMFs, and this gives us\nconfidence. Under these assumptions, we can study the\nexpected distribution of the the metal-free stars in the\nMilky Way at z = 0, if they had a similar IMF as the\nlocal stars.\n2.2. Identifying Metal-Free Stars\n\nIn Paper I, we combined a high-resolution N-body simulation that can resolve the formation of halos \u223c 107 M\u2299\nwith a semi-analytic model of outflows. In our semianalytic model, we considered that the outflows are induced by star formation in the halos, depending on their\ntotal mass, and traced the enrichment history of the intergalactic medium due to such outflows. Then, we identified the site of metal-free star formation as halos which\nare massive enough to make stars and have not been enriched by the outflows from other halos.\nIt is also worth mentioning that numerical simulations\nhave shown that outflows tend to be highly anisotropic,\neven if they originate from spherical halos (Martel &\nShapiro 2001a,b). The external medium surrounding halos tends to be anisotropic. When gas ejected from halos enters that medium, it naturally follows the path of\nleast resistance, becoming anisotropic. Energy and metals are deposited in low-density regions, away from dense\nstructures. This effect strongly reduces the likelihood\nof galaxies being hit by outflows originating from other\ngalaxies, unless the outflows are very narrow and can\ntravel large distances, across cosmological voids (Pieri,\nMartel, & Grenon 2006). The net effect is a significant\nsuppression of the metal-enrichment of halos by neighboring galaxies, enabling these halos to retain their primordial composition up to low redshifts, when they may\nform stars.\nThe chemo-dynamical simulations employed in this\npresent study do not require the inclusion of an approximate semi-analytic model. Rather, they include the\neffects of the SNe feedback completely self-consistently\nwithin the SPH method. First-generation star particles\nform on an individual basis, and we track the independent chemical evolution of each and every gas particle,\nstarting from primordial gas. We then use these individual metal-free star particles as tracers of metal-free stars,\nand analyze their locations at z = 0.\nIt is believed that the bulk of metal-free stars are\nformed in halos with total mass around \u223c 107 M\u2299\n(Tegmark et al. 1997; Fuller & Couchman 2000; Yoshida\net al. 2003). However, it is unknown what fraction of\nthe gas in the halo turns into metal-free stars (e.g. Abel,\nBryan, & Norman 2000), whether the SNe by metal-free\nstars disrupt the gas in the halo completely (Bromm,\nYoshida, & Hernquist 2003), although full radiative\ntransfer calculations of Kitayama & Yoshida (2005) in-\n\ndicate that all the gas is evacuated, or whether such SNe\nalso induce the second generation stars in the halo (Susa\n& Umemura 2006). It is also possible that two types of\nmetal free stars form, Pop III stars, with mass of 100M\u2299\nand more, and metal free stars forming in halos with\nT> 104 K, with masses as low as 10M\u2299 (Greif & Bromm\n2006). Simulations of these processes have far greater\nresolution than we can manage when simulating a galaxy\nin a cosmological context.\nUnfortunately, the resolution of cosmological, SPH\ngalaxy formation simulations is not sufficient to identify the halos where the metal-free stars are likely to\nform, or to follow the physical processes in the halos, in\nthe manner of e.g. Yoshida (2006). Rather, the minimum mass of the halo that we can resolve is between\n108 M\u2299 and 109 M\u2299 , depending on the simulation. However, in a hierarchical clustering scenario, each and every 108 M\u2299 \u2212 109 M\u2299 halo is expected to be pre-dated\nby smaller halos, i.e. building blocks. Thus, if a given\n\u2248 108 \u2212 109 M\u2299 halo is sufficiently isolated, its earliest\nforming smaller progenitor, such as \u223c 107 M\u2299 halos,\nshould have been the site of metal-free star formation.\nBased on this scenario, we assume that some fraction of\nthe mass of simulation metal-free star particles is metalfree stars, and that the metal free simulation star particle\ntrace the location of the metal-free stars. Thus our study\nassumes that the final distribution of stars in the stellar halo is primarily determined by the dynamics and\naccretion of the \u223c 108 M\u2299 halos that our simulations\nresolve. In this case the remaining uncertainty is how\nmany \"metal-free stars\" correspond to each zero metallicity star particle at z = 0. As mentioned above, this\ndepends on the star formation history in the 106 \u2212107 M\u2299\nmini-halos which we do no resolve. We simply assume an\nupper limit, by assuming all the stars in that simulation\nstar particle are metal-free, and follow the Salpeter IMF.\nThis assumption guarantees that some fraction of metalfree stars survive till z=0, and allows us to use the metalfree simulation star particles as tracers of the positon of\nmetal-free stars. Therefore, our absolute mass density of\nthe metal-free stars are likely overestimated. However,\nwe are able to determine the radial distribution of the\nmetal-free stars, using this simple approach. This allows\nus to determine whether local observations can be used\nas a constraint on the Population III IMF.\nFinally, we also trace the position of old stars, which we\ndefine as the oldest star particles, regardless of whether\nthey form from primordial material. In order to compare\ntheir distributions with metal-free stars, the mass of oldest and metal-free stars that we trace are approximately\nequal, i.e. the total mass of the oldest star particles and\nmetal-free star particles are the same. As mentioned\nabove, we employ four disk galaxy formation models,\nthat adopt different galaxy formation models and different prescriptions of SNe feedback. These test how the\nfinal distribution of metal-free stars and the oldest stars\nare sensitive to the evolution history of galaxies and the\neffect of the SNe feedback. Hereafter, we call the simulation star particles that house metal-free stars, i.e. firstgeneration Pop III stars, and an equivalent mass of the\nvery oldest star particles as \"oldest\" stars.\nThe strengths and shortcomings of the SPH approach,\nwhich includes gas dynamics, cooling, star formation and\nfeedback self consistently (Paper II), and the higher reso-\n\n\f4\nTABLE 1\nParameters of the simulations\nModel\n\nMvir\n(M\u2299 )\n\nAFM\nTFM\nKGCD\nAGCD\n\n10.\u00d71011\n4.9\u00d71011\n8.8\u00d71011\n9.3\u00d71011\n\na Mass\n\nrvir\n(kpc)\n275\n275\n240\n270\n\nmgas a\n(M\u2299 )\n\nmDM b\n(M\u2299 )\n\n\u01ebgas c\n(kpc)\n\n\u01ebDM d\n(kpc)\n\n\u03a90\n\n\u039b0\n\nh0\n\n\u03a9b\n\n\u03c38\n\n7.3\u00d7106\n7.3\u00d7106\n9.2\u00d7105\n3.3\u00d7106\n\n4.9\u00d7107\n4.9\u00d7107\n6.2\u00d7106\n1.9\u00d7107\n\n0.93\n0.93\n0.57\n0.87\n\n1.6\n1.6\n1.1\n1.5\n\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n\n0.7\n0.7\n0.7\n0.7\n\n0.7\n0.7\n0.7\n0.65\n\n0.039\n0.039\n0.039\n0.045\n\n0.9\n0.9\n0.9\n0.9\n\nof gas particles.\n\nb Mass of dark matter particles.\nc Softening length of gas particles.\nd Softening\n\nlength of dark matter particles.\n\nlution N-body + semi-analytic approach, which allows a\ngreater diversity of feedback implementations (Paper I)\nmake the two studies complimentary.

RESULTS\n\nIn Figure 1, we plot the star formation rate (SFR) as\na function of redshift for our four simulated Milky-Way\nanalogues. The SFR for all stars within the virial radius\nat z = 0 is plotted as a dot-dashed line, and the SFR\nfor metal-free stars as a solid line. It is notable that\nthe AFM and TFM models, which have the same initial\nconditions but different treatments of SNe feedback, have\nsignificantly different star formation histories, with star\nformation relatively delayed in the AFM run (see Brook\net al. 2004, for details).\nMetal-free stars continue forming over a wide range\nof redshifts, from before redshift z = 11 down beyond\nredshift z = 4. Even though it had a relatively large\neffect on the star formation history of the galaxy, the\ndifferent feedback implemented in the AFM and TFM\nruns have not resulted in a drastic change in the star formation history of metal-free stars. Although the AFM,\nKGCD, and AGCD form very few metal-free stars after\nredshift z = 4, metal-free stars do continue to form beyond redshift z = 3. Overall, the redshift range of metfree star formation is quite consistent among the four\nmodels, starting along with the oldest stars beyond redshift z = 11 and continuing to z \u223c 3. Furthermore,\nthis redshift range is roughly consistent with the weak\nand intermediate wind models in Paper I. As expected\nwith the differences between the models explained above,\nthe higher resolution simulations in Paper I allow some\nmetal-free stars to form at higher redshift, z \u223c 15.\nFigures 2\u20135 present the final distributions of both\nmetal-free and oldest stars. The top left panels show\nthe distribution of the oldest (red \"\u00d7\") and metal-free\n(black \"+\") stars in X-Z plane, with axis of 100 kpc,\nand where Z is the direction of the rotation axis of the\nstellar disk at z = 0. The upper right panels show the\nmass density of the two populations as a function of radius (distance from the center), in units of M\u2299 /pc3 . The\nstellar halo mass of each simulation is normalized to that\nof the Milky Way, by requiring that the solar neighborhood density matches that for the Milky Way, 5.7 \u00d7 105\nM\u2299 pc\u22123 (Preston, Shectman, & Beers 1991).\nThe lower left panel of figures 2\u20135 show the radial\n\ndependence of the mass fraction of metal-free and oldest\nstars with respect to the total stellar mass at each radius\nat z = 0. The lower right panel displays the distributions\nof the radius of the birth-place for metal-free stars and\noldest stars, which is measured from the center of the\nlargest proto-galaxy at the time they born.\nAlthough the details of the distribution of metal-free\nand oldest stars differ among the four models, several\ntrends can be seen to be common to all models. Not surprisingly, the absolute density of metal-free and oldest\nstars are higher at smaller radii. The oldest stars have\nsteeper density profile than metal-free stars, i.e. oldest\nstars are more centrally concentrated. In terms of where\nthese stars are best searched for in current surveys of\nstars, the most important quantity is not the absolute\ndensity, but rather the number fraction, with respect to\nthe field stars. This is shown in the lower left panels of\nFigures 2\u20135. Here, we define the field stars as all stellar\nhalo stars at that radius, computed by using the Toomre\ndiagram and requiring that T 2 +V 2 > (V \u2212Vdisk )2 where\nT 2 = U 2 + W 2 , U , V , W are the radial, rotational, and\nout-of-plane velocity components, respectively, and Vdisk\nis the rotation velocity of the stellar disk component.\nHere, Vdisk for each model is measured as the mean rotation velocity for the young disk stars (which formed after\nz \u223c 0.8)\nThese panels show clearly that the oldest stars are\nhighly concentrated in the bulge regions in the center\nof the galaxies. On the other hand, metal-free stars have\na higher fraction in the outer regions, i.e. in halo region. This strong difference between the oldest and the\nmetal-free stars is in fact more extreme than what was\nseen in Paper I (see Figs. 4, 5, and 7 in that paper).\nIn Paper I, our N-body+semi-analytic model predicted\na roughly constant fraction independent of the radius,\nwhile the chemo-dynamical simulation model shown here\npredicts that the outer region has a higher fraction of\nmetal-free stars than the inner region. This is because\nthe chemo-dynamical simulations naturally provide the\ndensity profile of the field stellar component, which is\nmore centrally concentrated than the dark matter component. This difference leads to a difference in the profiles of the normalized mass fraction of metal-free stars in\nour two papers. Nevertheless, if anything our conclusion\nfrom the chemo-dynamical models is even stronger than\nthat reached in Paper I, and we predict that the current\nsurvey area, i.e. the solar neighborhood and outer halo,\n\n\f5\nTABLE 2\nAverage baryonic mass of the\nproto-galaxies where metal-free\nstars and oldest stars form (in\nunits of 109 M\u2299 ).\nModel\n\nmetal-free stars\n\noldest stars\n\nAFM\nTFM\nKGCD\nAGCD\n\n1.5\n1.3\n0.7\n2.1\n\n6.5\n6.8\n8.2\n4.3\n\nis the best place to look for Pop III stars. Thus, from\na completely different perspective, we again find that if\nthey have sufficiently long lifetimes, a significant number of stars formed in initially primordial gas should be\nfound in the Galactic halo.\nWhile this overall trend is constant across our SPH\nmodels, there are nevertheless a number of interesting\ndifferences between the runs, which we now discuss in\nfurther detail. First, we compare the TFM and AFM\nruns, i.e., the runs with different implementations of SNe\nfeedback. Figures 2 and 3 show that both metal-free and\noldest stars are slightly more centrally concentrated in\nTFM model than the AFM model. This is related to\ntheir star formation histories in Figure 1. In TFM, a\nlarger number of stars are born at very high redshifts,\nbecause there is no mechanism to suppress star formation in the small proto-galaxies. As a result, oldest stars\nin the TFM run are an older population than those in\nthe AFM run, and there is a larger fraction of metal-free\nstars which are oldest stars, \"metal-free+oldest stars.\"\nDue to the so-called bias effect, the halos near the density peak of the final system form earlier, and the metalfree+oldest stars form in these halos. The lower-right\npanels of Figures 2 and 3 demonstrate this clearly. In\nTFM, more metal-free stars form close to the center of\nthe biggest galaxy, which leads to the bimodal distribution of the distance of their birth place. The stars which\nformed close to the center of the biggest galaxy accreted\nto the system at earlier epoch. This leads to a larger\nnumber of metal-free +oldest stars ending up in the central region in TFM than AFM.\nKGCD has the most clear difference in distributions\nbetween metal-free and oldest stars, in terms of their\nmass fraction at different radii, with the model AGCD\nalso showing a distinct difference in such distributions.\nIn the bottom right panels of Figures 2\u20135, the largest\nprogenitor is taken as being at the lowest radius. Examining the AGCD model for example, this diagram highlights how a relatively small number of metal-free stars\ncan pollute the progenitor in which many of the oldest\nstars form. Yet at large distances from this largest, central progenitor, metal-free stars continue to form.\nThree different initial conditions having three different\npatterns of small-scale density perturbations have been\nemployed in our models, which lead to different merger\nhistories of their progenitor halos, i.e., building blocks.\nYet all models have similar spreads in the distribution of\noldest stars, with a cutoff of the oldest stars around 10\nkpc. Lower panels of Figures 2\u20135 show how the final distribution of metal-free and oldest stars reflects their birth\n\nplaces. The oldest stars generally form in the largest\nprogenitor, associated with the largest density peak, collapsing at the highest redshift, so that they tend to be\nin the inner region of the galaxy at z = 0. Even though\nthe final distributions of metal-free and old stars depend\nto a degree on their merger histories, all the models lead\nto similar trends for the distributions of metal-free and\noldest stars.\nAlthough our chemo-dynamical simulations are not capable of resolving the minimum mass of halos which can\nform metal-free stars, \u223c 107 M\u2299 , it is still interesting to\nsee the mass of the halo in which metal-free and oldest\nstars formed. Using a friend of friends (FOF) algorithm\nat each time-step, we are able to calculate the mass of the\nhalos in which each star is born. We are limited here by\ntime resolution of the simulation outputs, where we need\nto assume that the mass of an object has not changed\nsignificantly between the output time steps, \u223c 0.2 Gyr.\nTable 2 presents the mean total masses of halos in which\nmetal-free and oldest stars formed, respectively, where\nwe define the total mass of the halo as a total (dark\nmatter and baryon) mass within the halo found by our\nFOF algorithm. It is clear that the masses of the halos\nwhere metal-free stars form are on average lower than\nthose of halos where oldest stars form. This ranges from\na factor of \u223c 2 larger in the AGCD simulation to a factor of \u223c 12 in the higher-resolution KGCD simulation.\nCombined with the radial distribution of the birth-places\nof the metal-free stars, shown in Figures 2\u20135, it is clear\nthat metal-free stars form in lower mass halos that collapse at later epochs, but are chemically isolated from the\nmore massive, earlier collapsing halos in which the oldest stars are born. Consequently, metal-free stars have\na much greater spread in distribution, compared with\noldest stars.\n4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nUsing chemo-dynamical simulations of Milky-Wayanalogue galaxies, we study the present day distribution of stars formed from primordial material, i.e., firstgeneration stars (\"metal-free stars\"), and an equivalent\nmass of the very earliest stars formed (\"oldest stars\").\nOur simulations employ various implementations of energy feedback, different resolutions, and different random\ninitial density fluctuations. We find consistent trends in\nthe distributions of the metal-free and oldest stars in our\nfour diverse simulations at least withing the limitations\nof our modeling. The main results are as follows:\n\u2022 Metal-free stars can form in isolated proto-galaxies\nuntil relatively low redshift. Therefore, metal-free\nstars are not necessarily among the very oldest\nstars.\n\u2022 Metal-free stars have different radial distribution\nprofiles from oldest stars. The oldest stars have a\nmore centrally concentrated distribution, i.e., they\nare preferentially found in the bulge regions of the\nMilky Way. On the other hand, metal-free stars are\ndistributed through the halo, and in terms of the\nfraction with respect to the field stars, metal-free\nstars are easier to be found in the outer regions.\nIn addition, our chemodynamical simulation approach\nsuggests:\n\n\f6\n\nFig. 1.- Star formation rates (SFR) in M\u2299 /yr for the 4 models, from left to right: AFM, TFM, KGCD, and AGCD. The dot-dashed\nline shows all stars, while the solid line shows the SFR for stars formed from primordial material, or \"metal-free\" stars.\n\nFig. 2.- The distribution of the oldest (red \"\u00d7\") and metalfree (black \"+\") stars in the AFM are plotted in X-Z plane in the\ntop left panel, with axis of 100 kpc, and where Z is the direction\nof the angular momentum vector. The oldest stars are centrally\nconcentrated in the bulge region, while the metal-free stars are\nspread throughout the halo. In the last three panels, red lines\nshow the oldest stars while black lines are metal-free stars. The\nblue dotted line indicates the spatial resolution limitation of the\nsimulations. The upper right panel shows the mass density of the\ntwo populations as a function of radius, in units of M\u2299 /pc3 . The\nstellar halo density of the simulation is normalized to that of the\nMilky Way in the solar neighborhood. Stellar mass loss from a\ntop heavy IMF is also not accounted for. The lower left panel\nshows the radial dependence of the mass fraction of stars at z = 0,\nfor the two populations. The lower right panel shows the radial\ndependence of the mass fraction of the two populations of stars at\ntheir birth-place and birth-time. For this plot, the center at each\ntime is taken as the center of the largest protogalaxy at that time.\n\nFig. 3.- Same as Figure 2, for the TFM. No significant difference\nin trends are apparent, despite the difference in feedback models\nand subsequent difference in star formation histories .\n\n\u2022 The stellar halo density profile has a steeper slope\nthan the dark matter density profile. As a result,\nthe mass fraction of the metal-free stars with respect to the halo stars are higher in the outer region. The almost flat radial trend found in Paper\nI is due to the assumption that the stellar density\nprofile is the same as the dark matter density profile.\nThe results are driven by the combination of two results: (1) the contribution of different sigma overdensities have different density profiles in the final halo, ie\nlower sigma peaks have flatter density profiles (Moore et\n\nFig. 4.- Distributions for KGCD model, using the formats of\nthe previous two figures.\n\n\f7\nhalo. This means that there is no compelling theoretical\nreason to motivate observational searches in more difficult environments, i.e., in the bulge region, and present\nobservations should be taken as directly constraining the\ndistribution of Population III (Pop III) stars. The lack\nof metal-free halo stars today should be taken as strong\nevidence of a M \u2265 0.8 M\u2299 lower limit on the IMF\nof metal-free stars. Our results provide encouragement\nfor observers of extreme low-metallicity stars in the solar neighborhood, which have direct implications on our\nknowledge of the chemical properties of Pop III stars,\nand encourage theorists who wish to use such results as\nthe basis of their analysis of the nature of the metal-free\nstars.\n\nFig. 5.- Distributions for AGCD model, using the formats of\nthe previous three figures.\n\nal 2006), and the fact that the isolated, relatively late\nforming proto-galaxies (i.e. those forming in low sigma\npeaks), form from primordial material.\nIn terms our question \"where are the metal-free\nstars?\", our chemo-dynamical simulation approach has\nreached the same answer as Paper I. Thus, we repeat here\nour conclusion in Paper I: if they have sufficiently long\nlifetimes, a significant number of stars formed in initially\nprimordial star clusters should be found in the Galactic\n\nWe thank M.
