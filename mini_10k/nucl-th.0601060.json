The new information on the E2 transition strengths constitutes a stringent\ntest for the nuclear models [1, 2] and has motivated us to revisit the use of the Interacting Boson Model (IBM) for\nthese isotopes. Previous work [3], using a version of the IBM-2 with configuration mixing, has shown that a good\ndescription of the stable germanium nuclei can be obtained. In the present work we apply the standard, two-particle\ntwo-hole, IBM-2 with configuration mixing [4] to the stable nuclei and extrapolate the model predictions to the\nrecently explored radioactive neutron-rich isotopes 78,80 Ge and the single-closed shell nucleus 82 Ge.\nThe irregular neutron-dependence of important observables such as the excitation energy of the 0+\n2 states, the\nrelative values of the B(E2)\u2032 s and the population cross sections in two-neutron-transfer reactions [5] have suggested\nthat a structural change takes place around N = 40 for Ge isotopes. In combination with the measurement of the\n+\nelectric quadrupole moments associated with the 2+\n1 and 22 states [6, 7], this experimental data has been taken as\nevidence of a shape transition and the coexistence of two different kinds of deformations for this isotopic chain [8].\nFor many years several theoretical mechanisms have been proposed to explain these phenomena simultaneously in a\nconsistent way. For example, in the early seventies the variation of the 0+\n2 excitation energies was explained under the\nassumption of a second minima in the potential energy surface [9]. However the success of this description was limited\nas the excited states were not well reproduced. Investigations of the nuclear structure with the dynamic deformation\ntheory [10] were also performed leading to the determination of potential energy surfaces and energy levels of the Ge\n72\nisotopes. Although these calculations were not able to predict correctly the 2+\nGe, the results implied\n2 state for the\nthat the Ge nuclei were very soft and present an oblate-prolate shape phase transition [11]. Another relevant work\nthat uses a boson Hamiltonian to describe the quadrupole degrees of freedom for the Ge isotopes, is the study based\non the coupling of pairing and collective quadrupole vibrational modes [12] through a boson expansion procedure [13].\nThis formalism describe successfully many features of the Ge isotopes, although it had some difficulties in fitting some\nof the two-nucleon transfer cross sections.\nII.\n\nIBM-2 WITH CONFIGURATION MIXING FOR GE ISOTOPES\n\nUnder the assumption that the 0+\n2 states in the germanium isotopes arise from an intruder configuration, in this\ncontribution we reconsider the formalism of the IBM-2 with configuration mixing to describe the nuclear structure of\nthese nuclei. In the IBM-2 the nucleus is modeled as a system of two types of interacting bosons, proton- and neutronbosons, that can have angular momentum and parity J P = 0+ , 2+ and are denoted by the creation(annihilation)\noperators s\u2020\u03c1 (s\u03c1 ), and d\u2020\u03c1 (d\u03c1 ), respectively, where \u03c1 = \u03c0 indicates protons and \u03c1 = \u03bd is used for neutrons.\n\n\f2\nA N\u03bd\n68 4\n70 5\n72 5\u0304\n74 4\u0304\n76 3\u0304\n78 2\u0304\n80 1\u0304\n82 0\n\n\u03c7\u03bd\n1.45\n1.40\n1.30\n1.20\n1.12\n0.92\n0.85\n\n\u03b5 [MeV]\n1.40 (1.40)\n1.40 (1.30)\n1.40 (1.30)\n1.20 (1.10)\n1.00 (1.05)\n1.00 (1.00)\n1.00 (1.03)\n1.10 (1.30)\n\n\u03ba [MeV]\n-0.20 (-0.25)\n-0.20 (-0.23)\n-0.21 (-0.23)\n-0.21 (-0.23)\n-0.21 (-0.25)\n-0.23 (-0.26)\n-0.24 (-0.27)\n\n\u2206 [MeV] e2 [eb]\n3.73\n0.052\n3.35\n0.047\n2.50\n0.033\n0.94\n0.032\n0.03\n0.032\n-0.98\n0.032\n-1.92\n0.032\n-3.00\n0.038\n\nTABLE I: Parameters used in this calculation. The bar above the number of neutron-bosons indicates that the bosons\ncorrespond to pairs of neutron-holes. The values for the intruder configuration are given in parenthesis. For all the isotopes\nN\u03c0 =2(4), \u03c7\u03c0 =-1.2(-1.4), \u03be1 =\u03be2 =\u03be3 =0.05(0.1), \u03b10 =\u03b12 =0.115 MeV. The effective charges for the normal component, e2 , are\ngiven in the last column, while for the intruder we took e4 = 2 e2 .\n\nThe mixing calculation consists of first describing the general features of the two configurations in terms of two\ndifferent IBM-2 calculations and then combining these two results using a mixing operator. Each configuration is\ndescribed using a Hamiltonian of the form\nH = \u03b5nd + \u03baQ\u03c0 * Q\u03bd + M\u03c0\u03bd ,\n\n(1)\n\nQ\u03c1 = (s\u2020\u03c1 de\u03c1 + d\u2020\u03c1 s\u03c1 )(2) + \u03c7\u03c1 (d\u2020\u03c1 de\u03c1 )(2) ,\n\n(2)\n\nP\n\u2020\nwhere nd =\n\u03bc, \u03c1 (d\u03bc\u03c1 d\u03bc\u03c1 ) denotes the number operator of d-bosons, Q\u03c1 represents the quadrupole operator for\nprotons and neutrons\n\nand M\u03c0\u03bd is the Majorana interaction\n\nM\u03c0\u03bd = \u03be2 (s\u2020\u03c0 d\u2020\u03bd \u2212 d\u2020\u03c0 s\u2020\u03bd )(2) (s\u03c0 de\u03bd \u2212 de\u03c0 s\u03bd )(2) +\n\nX\n\nK=1,3\n\n\u03beK (d\u2020\u03c0 d\u2020\u03bd )(K) (de\u03c0 de\u03bd )(K) .\n\n(3)\n\nThe two Hamiltonians are diagonalized independently in its appropriate space. The active model space for protons in\nthe normal configuration consists of two proton-bosons, whereas the intruder space is conformed of four proton-bosons,\none boson-hole in the 20-28 shell and three boson-particles in the 28-50 shell. The mixing Hamiltonian that connects\nthis two configurations does not conserve the number of bosons and is given by\nHmix = \u03b10 (s\u2020\u03c0 s\u2020\u03c0 + s\u03c0 s\u03c0 ) + \u03b12 (d\u2020\u03c0 \u00d7 d\u2020\u03c0 + de\u03c0 \u00d7 de\u03c0 )(0) .\n\n(4)\n\nA third parameter, \u2206, is needed in order to specify the unperturbed energy required to excite two protons across the\nclosed shell [14]. Using the eigenfunctions of the two separate configurations one forms the matrix elements of Hmix .\nThe final wave functions are obtained from the diagonalization of the resulting matrix.\nIn total we used 11 independent parameters per nucleus, specified on Table I. The values of \u03c7\u03c0 , \u03be1 =\u03be2 =\u03be3 , \u03b10 =\u03b12\nare kept constant for all eight nuclei and \u03c7\u03bd is taken the same for the normal and intruder configurations. The\nvariation of \u2206 as function of the neutron number is linear, with the same slope as the one suggested in Ref. [3]. Our\n\u2206 values are larger than the ones given in [3] because we are assumming that the intruder configuration originates\nfrom the excitation of one proton pair across the Z = 28 shell gap instead of a proton pair within the same valence\nspace. According to [15] this linear behavior arises from the monopole contribution to the neutron-proton interaction.\nThe calculated low-energy levels for the even 68\u221282 Ge isotopes are shown in Fig. 1 together with the experimental\ndata taken from Ref. [16]. A satisfactory agreement for the entire isotope chain is obtained. The evolution of the\nmixing as the neutron number increases, can be seen in Fig. 1 by looking at the column next to the theoretical spectra\nfor each isotope. Each horizontal bar gives the eigenfunction composition, the gray portion represents the sum of the\nsquare coefficents of the normal components, while the white portion represents the same quantity for the intruder\ncomponents.\nFrom the Fig. 1 one observes a one-to-one correspondence between the experimental and theoretical energy levels\n68\n70\nfor 68 Ge and 70 Ge up to an excitation energy of \u223c 3 MeV, with the 3+\nGe and the 2+\nGe showing\n1 state of\n3 state of\n68\nthe largest discrepancies. The mixing in the wave functions of Ge is very small and the two configurations appear\nwell separated with the normal (intruder) component been predominant for the low(high) energy levels; for 70 Ge\nthe mixing starts to become important, especially for high energies, while the normal configuration still dominates at\nenergies less than 1 MeV. For 72 Ge the theoretical calculation yields a 2+\n3 state which has no experimental counterpart.\n\n\f3\n\n+\nB(E2; 2+\n1 \u2192 01 )\n+\n+\nB(E2; 21 \u2192 02 )\n+\nB(E2; 2+\n2 \u2192 21 )\n+\n+\nB(E2; 41 \u2192 21 )\nQ(2+\n1)\nQ(2+\n2)\n\n68\nGe\nEXP.

The units of the B(E2) values are given by 10\u22123 e2 b2 while for the quadrupole moments\none uses 10\u22122 eb.\n\nThe existence of such a level has also been suggested by other authors [3] using different theoretical approaches [11].\n+\nAccording to our calculated electromagnetic transitions, 2+\n3 represents the continuation of the 02 band-head. The\n72\nmixing is maximal for Ge with a nearly 50% normal, 50% intruder composition of the eigenfunctions. For 74 Ge\nthe two configurations are inverted, and it is now the intruder configuration that dominates the low-energy levels in\nthe spectra, while the normal component becomes important only for higher energy levels. For the isotopes 76 Ge to\n82\nGe, the fit of the energy levels is good although there is an increasing lack of experimental information as one moves\nto the neutron-rich part of the chain. For those isotopes the mixing seems to be less relevant, as there is only one\ndominant configuration. The extreme case for this situation is the neutron-closed-shell nucleus 82 Ge, that has N\u03bd =0\nand therefore a simple IBM-1 calculation is able to reproduce the scarce experimental information available.\nIn Table II we present the most important electric quadrupole transitions between the calculated energy levels for\nthe germanium isotopes.

Thus one concludes that the condition on \u03b2\u03c1 and \u03b3\u03c1 mentioned above is equivalent to the\nprojection of the IBM-2 to the IBM-1 [18].\nThe first step followed in the study of the geometry associated to the IBM-2 plus configuration mixing for the Ge\nisotopes, was to consider the condition \u03b2\u03c0 = \u03b2\u03bd \u2192 \u03b2, \u03b3\u03c0 = \u03b3\u03bd \u2192 \u03b3. To convince ourselves that such consideration\nmakes sense, we performed a numerical calculation taking a large strength of the Majorana interaction. The result\nshows that indeed the wave functions as well as the energy levels associated to the ground band are almost not\naffected.\nThe energy surfaces obtained for the Ge isotopes are presented in Fig. 2. We display both the minimum and excited\nenergy surfaces (see equation (13)) as 3D-surfaces, together with their corresponding contour plots. One can see that\nfor 68 Ge there is coexistence between a spherical shape for the ground band and an oblate shape for the excited band;\nin the case of 70 Ge there is a coexistence between spherical and \u03b3-unstable deformations; for 72 Ge, the most mixed\nisotope, the lower energy band is spherical while excited energy levels are prolate. According to this interpretation, a\nshape transition occurs in 74 Ge, where one gets two different prolate shapes for the ground and excited bands; for 76 Ge\na similar behavior than the one associated to 74 Ge is found. Finally, there is a gradual evolution towards spherical\nshapes for the neutron-rich nuclei, in 78 Ge the coexistence is between a prolate ground band and an spherical excited\nband; in 80 Ge and 82 Ge both energy surfaces are spherical.\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 2: Energy surfaces associated to the ground (white) and excited (gray) bands are shown together with their corresponding\ncontour plots for each one of the Ge isotopes. x = \u03b2 cos \u03b3 and y = \u03b2 sin \u03b3. The left contour plot for each isotope is associated\nto the ground band while the right one belongs to the excited band. The dots indicate the deepest contour level of each energy\nsurface.\n\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn summary, we have presented a configuration mixing calculation for the even-even Ge isotopes including the\nradioactive isotopes 78,80,82 Ge. The good agreement between the theoretical and the experimental energy spectra,\nE2 transitions and quadrupole moments, supports the hypothesis that for light germanium isotopes (A = 68 \u2212 76)\nthe interplay of two configurations determines the low-energy structure of the nuclei. In this calculation we have\nassumed that the intruder configuration arises from the two-proton two-hole excitation across the Z = 28 shell gap.\nOur extrapolation to heavier isotopes (A = 78 \u2212 82) suggets that the configuration mixing is less important. However\na definitive conclusion requires more experimental information about these nuclei. By means of a matrix formulation\na geometric interpretation of the IBM-2 with configuration mixing was introduced. According to this each nucleus\nis described as a superposition of two energy surfaces that carry information about the equilibrium deformation\nparameters. It is shown that the projection \u03b2\u03c0 = \u03b2\u03bd \u2192 \u03b2 and \u03b3\u03c0 = \u03b3\u03bd \u2192 \u03b3 of these two energy surfaces reduces to the\ngeometric interpretation of the IBM-1 with configuration mixing. For the Ge isotopes, it is found that increasing the\nstrength of the Majorana interaction does not affect significantly the energies and B(E2) values of the ground state\nbands, justifying the use of IBM-1 projection to analyze the geometry. One finds that the shape of the ground band\nevolves from spherical in 68,70,72 Ge to prolate in 74,76,78 Ge with a shape phase transition from spherical to prolate\nnuclei occurring between 72 Ge and 74 Ge. The energy surfaces characterize the ground and excited bands of the Ge\nisotopes which have in general different shapes and an orthogonal composition of the normal (N ) and intruder (N + 2)\ncoherent states.\n\n\f7\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was partially supported by CONACyT.
