Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe \"remodeling conjecture\" [5, 27] asserts that the generating functions of Gromov-Witten\ninvariants of a toric Calabi-Yau threefold X are completely determined in terms of a topological recursion. The particular recursion is the Eynard-Orantin topological recursion\n[15, 17] applied to the complex curve \u03a3 mirror to X.\n\n1.1\n\nConstant terms\n\nThe simplest Gromov-Witten invariants are those involving constant maps to the target\nspace. They are encoded by the leading constant term Ng,0 in the Gromov-Witten generating functions Fg . It is known since the work of [18, 20, 28] that for g \u2265 2, the constant\nterms are given by:\n|B2g ||B2g\u22122 |\n1\nNg,0 = (\u22121)g \u03c7(X)\n,\n(1.1)\n2\n2g(2g \u2212 2)(2g \u2212 2)!\nwhere \u03c7(X) is the topological Euler characteristic of X.\nIn this paper we ask the following question: is the remodeling conjecture true for the full\nfree energies Fg , including constant terms, or just for the \"reduced free energies\" without\nthe constant terms? In other words, are the Fg constructed from the Eynard-Orantin\nrecursion applied to the complex curve mirror to X reproducing the \"right\" constant terms\nas in (1.1)? The fate of constant terms is notoriously subtle, as is well known for instance\nfrom the DT/GW correspondence [29, 30].\nAs far as we are aware, constant terms have not been studied yet from the point of view\nof the remodeling conjecture. The main reason is that most of the checks and proofs of\nthe conjecture have been done by comparing with the topological vertex on the GromovWitten side, which computes only the reduced Gromov-Witten theory. Hence not much\nhas been said about constant maps.\nApart from clarifying the remodeling conjecture, constant terms are interesting for\nmany reasons. For instance, over the years matrix models have been constructed which\nencode Gromov-Witten partition functions Z of various toric geometries [1, 10, 12, 13,\n22, 26, 34, 35]. The spectral curves of these matrix models give the corresponding mirror curves. However, the constant part of the matrix models do not generally give the\nright power of the MacMahon function to recover the contributions from constant maps in\nGromov-Witten theory. Thus one can ask: Are the Fg constructed through the EynardOrantin recursion for these spectral curves giving the Gromov-Witten constant terms, or\nthe constant terms of the corresponding matrix models? A priori, one would think that\nthey should give the constant terms of the matrix models, since the Fg obtained from the\nrecursion are supposed to be the free energies of the corresponding matrix models. But are\nthe loop equations, to which the recursion is a solution, really aware of the overall matrix\nmodel normalization?\n\n1\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\nV. Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\nThis question occurs already in the case of the resolved conifold. Here, various matrix\nmodels are known (see for instance [1, 10, 26, 35]). They all give spectral curves that are\n\"symplectically equivalent\", hence should all produce the same free energies through the\nEynard-Orantin recursion. However, these matrix models have different normalizations, i.e.\ndifferent powers of the MacMahon functions for the constant terms. More generally, matrix\nmodels built from the topological vertex formalism for arbitrary toric threefolds [12, 22, 34]\nby construction do not involve any factors of MacMahon function, while matrix models\nconstructed by other means [1, 26, 35] by construction involve such factors. Yet, they have\nbeen shown to determine the same mirror curves [13, 35]. How can that be? Given a\nspectral curve (or two symplectically equivalent curves), the Fg are uniquely constructed\nby the recursion, including constant terms. How can they reproduce the free energies of\nmatrix models with different constant terms?\nWhat seems to be happening is the following. The Eynard-Orantin recursion is a\nsolution to the loop equations of matrix models. The loop equations however do not\n\"know\" about constant terms; two matrix models differing only by overall normalization\nshould give the same loop equations, hence \"symplectically equivalent\" spectral curves.\nThe recursion however does compute constant terms. Therefore, those are not necessarily\nthe constant terms of the corresponding matrix models; the recursion replaces the constant\nterms of the matrix models by its own preferred constant terms.\nAnd what we argue in this paper is that, magically, the constant terms computed through\nthe recursion are precisely those of Gromov-Witten theory, as given in (1.1)! In other words,\nthe recursion knows the right constant terms. As a result, we assert that the remodeling\nconjecture holds for the full free energies, including constant terms.\nWhat we show is that for the simplest Calabi-Yau threefold X = C3 , the Fg are given\nby the Faber-Pandharipande formula (1.1) with \u03c7(X) = 1. Then, we argue that for any\ntoric Calabi-Yau threefold X, the constant part of the Fg will be given by \u03c7(X) times the\nFg of C3 , thus recovering (1.1) for all toric Calabi-Yau threefolds.\nIt would be nice to understand better, from a matrix model point of view, why the\nEynard-Orantin recursion does produce the right constant terms as in Gromov-Witten\ntheory. This remains quite mysterious, and should be addressed in future work.\nAs an aside we study, along the way, in more detail the notion of \"symplectic invariance\"\nof the free energies Fg , as well as their behavior under certain limits of mirror curves.\nIt turns out that the Fg are not, strictly speaking, symplectic invariants; we show that\nsymplectic transformations that change the number of ramification points do not leave\nthe Fg invariant. In the context of the remodeling conjecture, what happens is that there\nexists \"bad choices\" of framing for which the topological recursion does not produce the\ncorrect free energies. In fact, representations of the mirror curves quite often encountered in\nliterature, such as (2.20) for C3 and (2.21) for the conifold, correspond to such pathological\nchoices of framing. We also demonstrate that the recursive construction of the Fg does not\ncommute with certain limits of mirror curves. We plan to clarify these issues further.\n\n2\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\n1.2\n\nV. Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\nPair of pants decomposition\n\nA related question that we address in this paper is whether the pair of pants decomposition\nof the mirror curves plays a role in the recursion. Let \u03a3 be the curve mirror to a toric\nCalabi-Yau threefold X. Any such \u03a3 has a pair of pants decomposition. What we show is\nthat this pair of pants decomposition is in one-to-one correspondence with the C3 patches\ndecomposition of the mirror toric threefold X. And just as the C3 patches decomposition\nplays a crucial role in Gromov-Witten theory through the topological vertex formalism\n[2, 25, 31], the pair of pants decomposition also plays an important role on the mirror\nB-model side through the Eynard-Orantin recursion.\nIt turns out that the residue process at the ramification points built in at each level of\nthe Eynard-Orantin recursion implements directly this pair of pants decomposition. Each\npair of pants has its corresponding ramification point, and summing over ramification\npoints means that we are summing over contributions for each pair of pants, at each level\nof the recursion. In particular, for a given X, we argue that each pair of pants contribute\nprecisely the same amount to the constant part of its Fg , namely, the contribution coming\nfrom constant maps to C3 . In the case of the resolved conifold, we prove that the two pairs\nof pants contribute precisely the same amount to the full Fg , not just for constant terms.\nIt would be very nice to see how to understand the pair of pants decomposition of the free\nenergies for general toric Calabi-Yau threefolds X beyond the constant terms.\nAs a result, the residue process seems to be a close analog to the localization procedure\nin Gromov-Witten theory of toric manifolds. It would also very interesting to make this\nanalogy more precise.\n\n1.3\n\nOutline\n\nIn section 2, we review the basics of Gromov-Witten theory of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds\nand the construction of the corresponding mirror curves. We also review the EynardOrantin recursion, and state the remodeling conjecture. Section 3 is devoted to the analysis\nof constant terms. We first explain the role of ramification points in the recursion, and how\nthey are mirror to the torus fixed points of the toric Calabi-Yau threefold. We conjecture\n(and check to relatively high genus) that the Fg constructed from the mirror curve to C3\nare equal to the Gromov-Witten result (1.1) with \u03c7(X) = 1. Then we argue that for a\n3\ngeneral toric threefold X, each pair of pants contributes one copy of FgC , thus recovering\nthe full Faber-Pandharipande formula (1.1) for general X. We prove this result explicitly\nfor the case of the resolved conifold.\nFinally, in section 4 we discuss some of the issues that were encountered during the\nanalysis of section 3. In particular, we discuss the notion of symplectic invariance of the Fg .\nWe show that under some symplectic transformations that do not preserve the number of\nramification points, the Fg are not invariant.

It can be written as\nX=\n\nC3+k \\ S\n,\n(C\u2217 )k\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the k C\u2217 actions are given by\n(C\u2217 )i : (z1 , . . . , z3+k ) 7\u2192 (\u03bbTi1 z1 , . . . , \u03bbTi(3+k) z3+k ),\n\ni = 1, . . . , k,\n\n\u03bb \u2208 C\u2217 ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere the Tij \u2208 Z and S is a subset which is fixed by a continuous subgroup of (C\u2217 )k . In\nthis notation, the geometry is determined by the k vectors Ti , sometimes known as toric\ncharges.\nIt is well known that X is Calabi-Yau if and only if\n3+k\nX\n\nTia = 0,\n\ni = 1, . . . , k.\n\n(2.3)\n\na=1\n\nAs a result, every toric Calabi-Yau threefold is noncompact. Toric Calabi-Yau threefolds\ncan be represented by trivalent graphs, known as toric diagrams; the edges represent the\ntorus-invariant curves in X, while the vertices correspond to the torus fixed points.\n\n4\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\nV. Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\nExample 1. Here a few examples of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds and their toric charges.\nThe toric diagrams are shown in fig. 1.\n\u2022 X = C3 , which is the simplest toric Calabi-Yau threefold.\n\u2022 X = OP1 (\u22121) \u2295 OP1 (\u22121), known as the resolved conifold. Its toric charge is T =\n(\u22121, \u22121, 1, 1).\n\u2022 X = OP2 (\u22123), known as local P2 , which has toric charge T = (\u22123, 1, 1, 1).\n\nFigure 1: Toric diagrams for C3 , resolved conifold, and local P2 . The corresponding mirror curves arise by thickening the edges of toric diagrams. The\ntrivalent vertices in the toric diagram represent torus fixed points. As we\ndemonstrate in section 3.1, these torus fixed points are in one-to-one correspondence with ramification points of the corresponding mirror curve (for generic\nchoice of framing). Hence the A-model computation based on gluing of topological vertices is mirrored by the pair of pants decomposition of the topological\nrecursion computation in the B-model.\n\n2.1.2\n\nGromov-Witten theory\n\nConsider the moduli space Mg,n (X, \u03b2) of stable maps f : Sg \u2192 X from n-pointed\ngenus g Riemann surfaces Sg , with homology class f\u2217 [Sg ] = \u03b2 \u2208 H2 (X, Z). To define\nGromov-Witten invariants, we consider the Deligne-Mumford compactification Mg,n (X, \u03b2)\nof the moduli space of stable maps, and then construct its virtual fundamental class\n5\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\nV. Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\n[Mg,n (X, \u03b2)]virt . In this paper we focus on the case with no marked points, Mg (X.\u03b2) :=\nMg,0 (X.\u03b2).\nRoughly speaking, Gromov-Witten invariants are then defined as integrals of appropriate cohomology classes over this virtual fundamental class:\nZ\nh* * * ig,\u03b2 =\n(* * * ).\n(2.4)\n[Mg (X.\u03b2)]virt\n\nFor X a Calabi-Yau threefold, Mg (X, \u03b2) has virtual dimension 0. Thus we can define the\nfollowing Gromov-Witten invariants (for g \u2265 2):\nZ\nNg,\u03b2 = hig,\u03b2 =\n(2.5)\n1 = deg[Mg (X, \u03b2)]virt .\n[Mg (X,\u03b2)]virt\n\nThose are the invariants that we will be interested in.\nAs usual, we form generating functions for these invariants:\nX\nFg =\nNg,\u03b2 Q\u03b2\n(genus g free energies),\n\nF =\n\n\u03b2\u2208H2 (X,Z)\n\u221e\nX\n2g\u22122\n\n\u03bb\n\nFg\n\n(free energy),\n\n(2.6)\n\n(2.7)\n\ng=0\n\nZ =exp(F )\n\n(partition function).\n\n(2.8)\n\nIt is also customary to separate the constant maps \u03b2 = 0 from the non-constant ones.\nWe define the reduced free energies and reduced partition function as\nX\nFg\u03b26=0 =\nNg,\u03b2 Q\u03b2 ,\n(2.9)\n\nF \u03b26=0 =\n\n\u03b2\u2208H2 (X,Z)\n\u03b26=0\n\u221e\nX\n2g\u22122\n\n\u03bb\n\nFg\u03b26=0 ,\n\n(2.10)\n\ng=0\n\nZ \u03b26=0 =exp(F \u03b26=0 ).\n\n(2.11)\n\nThen we have that\nZ = Z \u03b26=0 Z \u03b2=0 ,\nwhere\n\n\uf8eb\nZ \u03b2=0 = exp \uf8ed\n\n\u221e\nX\ng=0\n\ninvolves only the constant map contributions.\n6\n\n(2.12)\n\uf8f6\n\n\u03bb2g\u22122 Ng,0 \uf8f8\n\n(2.13)\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\n2.1.3\n\nV. Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\nWhat is known\n\nGromov-Witten theory of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds has been studied extensively. For\nany toric Calabi-Yau threefold X, the reduced partition function Z \u03b26=0 can be computed\nusing the so-called topological vertex [2, 25, 31]. The topological vertex however does not\nsay anything about the constant contributions Z \u03b2=0 .\nFortunately the constant contributions can be computed independently [18, 20, 28].\nFor g \u2265 2, one gets that:\n|B2g ||B2g\u22122 |\n1\nNg,0 = (\u22121)g \u03c7(X)\n,\n2\n2g(2g \u2212 2)(2g \u2212 2)!\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere \u03c7(X) is the topological Euler characteristic of X. For X a toric Calabi-Yau threefold,\nit is easy to show that \u03c7(X) is equal to the number of torus fixed points (that is, the number\nof vertices in the toric diagram of X). In particular, for the simplest toric Calabi-Yau\nthreefold X = C3 , which has \u03c7(X) = 1, we have\n|B2g ||B2g\u22122 |\n1\nC3\nNg,0\n= (\u22121)g\n.\n2\n2g(2g \u2212 2)(2g \u2212 2)!\n\n(2.15)\n\nFor a general toric Calabi-Yau threefold, we thus obtain\n3\n\nX\nC\nNg,0\n= \u03c7(X)Ng,0\n.\n\n(2.16)\n\nThe result (2.14) can be neatly rewritten as [3, 24, 29, 30]\n1\n\nZ \u03b2=0 = M (q) 2 \u03c7(X) ,\n\n(2.17)\n\nwhere M (q) is the MacMahon function\nM (q) =\n\n\u221e \u0010\nY\n\n1 \u2212 qk\n\n\u0011\u2212k\n\n,\n\n(2.18)\n\nk=1\n\nwith q = ei\u03bb .\n\n2.2\n\nMirror symmetry\n\nThe free energy F of A-model topological string theory on a toric Calabi-Yau threefold X\ngenerates the Gromov-Witten invariants as in the previous subsection. It is however often\nuseful to study the free energy F from a dual point of view. Mirror symmetry relates the\nA-model free energy to the B-model topological string free energy, which we also denote\nby F , through the mirror map. The remodeling conjecture proposes a recursive formula to\ncompute the B-model genus g free energies Fg . Let us start by explaining what the mirror\nB-model theory looks like.\n7\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\n2.2.1\n\nV. Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\nThe mirror curve\n\nHere we construct the mirror geometry following Hori-Vafa [21]. We are interested in\nthe mirror B-model theory to the A-model on a toric Calabi-Yau threefold X. The mirror\ntheory is generally formulated as a Landau-Ginzburg theory. However, it was shown that it\nessentially reduces to the geometry of a complex curve, known as the mirror curve. In fact,\nthe remodeling conjecture is formulated entirely in terms of this mirror curve. Therefore\nhere we will define the mirror theory directly in terms of a mirror curve, skipping the\nLandau-Ginzburg step.\nLet X be a toric Calabi-Yau threefold defined by some toric charges Ti , i = 1, . . . , k.\nIntuitively, the mirror curve can be obtained by \"fattening\" the toric diagram, as shown\nin fig. 1. Mathematically, it is defined as follows.\nDefinition 1. The mirror curve of a toric Calabi-Yau threefold X defined by the toric\ncharges Ti , i = 1, . . . , k, is given by the family of curves:\n(\n)\n3+k\nY\nTim\nxm , i = 1, . . . , k ,\n(2.19)\n\u03a3 = 1 + x2 + . . . + x3+k = 0 ri =\nm=2\n\nwhere xm \u2208\n\nC\u2217\n\nfor m = 2, . . . , 3 + k.\n\nNote that this defines a family of curves in (C\u2217 )2 , where the family is parameterized\nby the ri . For instance, we can choose x := x2 and y := x3 to be our C\u2217 variables, and\neliminate the other xm 's using the definition of the parameters ri . The mirror curve \u03a3\ndefines a Riemann surface with punctures (which we also denote by \u03a3), and x and y are\nholomorphic functions on \u03a3.\nExample 2. Let X = C3 . According to (2.19), the mirror curve is\n\u03a3 = {1 + x + y = 0} \u2282 (C\u2217 )2 .\n\n(2.20)\n\nThe associated Riemann surface has genus 0 and three punctures (shown in figure 1).\nExample 3. Let X be the resolved conifold, X = OP1 (\u22121) \u2295 OP1 (\u22121), with toric charge\nT = (\u22121, \u22121, 1, 1). The mirror curve is\n\b\n\u03a3 = 1 + x + y + rxy \u22121 = 0 \u2282 (C\u2217 )2 .\n(2.21)\nThe associated Riemann surface has genus 0 and four punctures (shown in figure 1). Note\nthat \u03a3 is a family of curves, parameterized by r.\nExample 4. Consider local P2 , X = O(\u22123)P2 , with toric charge T = (\u22123, 1, 1, 1). The\nmirror curve is\n\b\n\u03a3 = 1 + x + y + rx\u22121 y \u22121 = 0 .\n(2.22)\nThe associated Riemann surface has genus 1 and three punctures (shown in figure 1).\n8\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\n2.2.2\n\nV. Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\nFraming\n\nIt turns out that the mirror curve can also depend on another parameter, known as \"framing\". In Gromov-Witten theory, the choice of framing appears because one needs to fix\nthe torus weights in order to apply localization under the torus action. It can also be\nunderstood from the point of view of large N dualities with Chern-Simons theory. For us,\nthe choice of framing appears as a reparameterization of the curve.\nDefinition 2. Let \u03a3 be a mirror curve, given by the locus {H(x, y) = 0} \u2282 (C\u2217 )2 . We\ndefine the associated framed curve \u03a3f by the C\u2217 reparameterization\nX = xy f .\n\nY = y,\n\n(2.23)\n\nThe framed curve is given by the locus {Hf (X, Y ) = 0} \u2282 (C\u2217 )2 , and it depends on a new\nparameter f , known as framing.\nRemark. Note that framing may seem a bit ad hoc, but as we will see it is rather crucial.\nExample 5. The mirror curve to C3 is (2.20). The framed curve \u03a3f is then\nn\no\n\u03a3f = 1 + XY \u2212f + Y = 0 \u2282 (C\u2217 )2 ,\n\n(2.24)\n\nor equivalently\nn\no\n\u03a3f = X + Y f + Y f +1 = 0 \u2282 (C\u2217 )2 ,\n\n2.3\n\n(2.25)\n\nTopological recursion\n\nThe remodeling conjecture is based on a particular topological recursion, known as EynardOrantin recursion [15, 17]. In this section we define the Eynard-Orantin topological recursion.\n\n2.3.1\n\nIngredients\n\nWe start with a smooth affine plane curve\nC = {H(x, y) = 0} \u2208 C2 .\n\n(2.26)\n\nIt defines a non-compact Riemann surface, which we also denote by C. x, y : C \u2192 C\nare holomorphic functions on C. As usual, C can be compactified to \u0108 by adding points\nat infinity, and x, y : \u0108 \u2192 C\u221e become meromorphic functions on the compact Riemann\nsurface \u0108.\nWe assume that the map x : C \u2192 C has only simple ramification points. Let\n{a1 , . . . , an } \u2208 C be the set of simple ramification points of x. Locally, at each a\u03bb ,\n\n9\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\nV. Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\n\u03bb = 1, . . . , n, the map is a double-sheeted covering, hence we have a deck transformation map\ns\u03bb : U\u03bb \u2192 U\u03bb\n(2.27)\nwhich is defined locally in a neighborhood U\u03bb of a\u03bb . The deck transformation map means\nthat\nx(t) = x(s\u03bb (t))\n(2.28)\nfor some local coordinate t near a\u03bb .\nThe type of objects that we will be interested in are meromorphic symmetric differentials. Let M1C be the sheaf of meromorphic one-forms on C. A degree n meromorphic\ndifferential Wn (p1 , . . . , pn ) is a section\nWn (p1 , . . . , pn ) \u2208 H 0 (C n ,\n\nn\nO\n\n\u03c0i\u2217 M1C ),\n\n(2.29)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere C n is the Cartesian product of n copies of C, and the \u03c0i , i = 1, . . . , n are the\nprojections on each individual factor. In local coordinates zi := z(pi ), pi \u2208 C, i = 1, . . . , n\na degree n differential can be written as1\nWn (p1 , . . . , pn ) = wn (z1 , . . . , zn )dz1 * * * dzn ,\n\n(2.30)\n\nwhere w(z1 , . . . , zn ) is meromorphic in each variable.\nTo define the recursion we need to introduce a particular degree 2 differential.\nDefinition 3. We define W20 (p1 , p2 ) to be the fundamental normalized bi-differential [19,\np.20] which is uniquely defined by the conditions:\n\u2022 It is symmetric, W20 (p1 , p2 ) = W20 (p2 , p1 );\n\u2022 It has its only pole, which is double, along the diagonal p1 = p2 , with no residue; its\nexpansion in this neighborhood has the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n0\nW2 (p1 , p2 ) =\n+ regular dz1 dz2 ;\n(2.31)\n(z1 \u2212 z2 )2\n\u2022 It is normalized by requiring that its periods about a basis of A-cycles on C vanish.2\nExample 6. For C = P1 , W20 is simply the Cauchy differentiation kernel:\nW20 (p1 , p2 ) =\n\ndz1 dz2\n.\n(z1 \u2212 z2 )2\n\n(2.32)\n\nHaving now defined the main ingredients, we can introduce the Eynard-Orantin recursion.\n1\n\nFor simplicity we will omit the tensor product symbol \u2297 between the differentials.\nW20 (p1 , p2 ) has also been called Bergman kernel in the literature. It is the second order derivative of\nthe log of the prime-form on C [19].\n2\n\n10\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\n2.3.2\n\nV. Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\nThe Eynard-Orantin topological recursion\n\nLet {Wng } be an infinite sequence of meromorphic differentials Wng (p1 , . . . , pn ) \u2208 MCn for\nall integers g \u2265 0 and n > 0 satisfying the condition 2g \u2212 2 + n \u2265 0. We say that the\ndifferentials with 2g\u22122+n > 0 are stable; W20 (p1 , p2 ) \u2208 MC2 is the only unstable differential.\nLet us introduce the shorthand notation S = {p1 , . . . , pn }. Then:\nDefinition 4. We say that the meromorphic differentials Wng satisfy the Eynard-Orantin\ntopological recursion if:\ng\nWn+1\n(p0 , S) =\n\nn\nX\n\u03bb=1\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\ng\u22121\ng1\ng2\nRes K\u03bb (p0 , q) Wn+2\n(q, s\u03bb (q), S)+\nW|I|+1\n(q, I)W|J|+1\n(s\u03bb (q), J) ,\n\nq=a\u03bb\n\ng1 +g2 =g\nI\u222aJ=S\n\n(2.33)\nwhere K\u03bb (p0 , q) is the Eynard kernel defined below. The recursion here is on the integer\n2g \u2212 2 + n, which is why it is called a topological recursion. The initial condition of the\nrecursion is given by the unstable W20 \u2208 MC2 defined above.\nDefinition 5. The Eynard kernel K\u03bb (p0 , q) is defined, in local coordinate q near a\u03bb , by\nR s\u03bb (q) 0\nW2 (p0 , q 0 )\n1 q\n,\nK\u03bb (p0 , q) =\n2 \u03c9(q) \u2212 \u03c9(s\u03bb (q))\nwhere \u03c9(q) is the meromorphic one-form \u03c9(q) = y(q)dx(q).

Let us first\ndefine\nZ q\n\u03a6(q) =\n\u03c9(q 0 ),\n(2.35)\n0\n\nwhich is the primitive of the one-form \u03c9(q) for an arbitrary base point 0. We then define:\nDefinition 6. The numbers Fg , g \u2265 2, are constructed from the one-forms W1g (p) by:\nFg =\n\nn\n(\u22121)g X\nRes \u03a6(q)W1g (q).\nq=a\u03bb\n2 \u2212 2g\n\u03bb=1\n\n11\n\n(2.36)\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\nV. Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\nRemark. We note that in the definition of Fg we introduced a factor (\u22121)g which is absent\nin the original formalism [15]. This factor arises from the fact that the generating parameter\n\u03bb in Gromov-Witten theory, introduced in (2.7), is related to the generating parameter ~\nconsidered in the formalism of [15] as ~ = \u2212i\u03bb. One way to see this identification arises\nfrom the fact that MacMahon function (2.18) should be expressed in terms of a unified\nparameter q = e\u2212~ = ei\u03bb .\nTo summarize, given an affine curve C, the Eynard-Orantin topological recursion constructs an infinite tower of meromorphic differentials Wng (p1 , . . . , pn ) (definition 4), and\nnumbers Fg := W0g (definition 6), for g \u2265 0, n > 0, satisfying the stability condition\n2g \u2212 2 + n > 0. The recursion kernel is the Eynard kernel (definition 5), and the initial\ncondition of the recursion is the fundamental normalized bi-differential on C (definition 3).\nThe Eynard-Orantin topological recursion appeared in the realm of matrix models.\nIt turns out that the large N limit of Hermitian matrix models is encoded in an affine\ncurve, known as the spectral curve of the matrix model. If we choose C to be this spectral\ncurve, then the meromorphic differentials Wng and numbers Fg compute respectively the\ncorrelation functions and free energies of the matrix model in its large N limit. This is\nwhere the recursion comes from. For this reason, we will often refer to the Wng as correlation\nfunctions, and to the Fg as free energies.\nHowever, it has been realized that the same topological recursion has many applications in other areas of mathematics, in particular in Gromov-Witten theory and mirror\nsymmetry, which is the content of the \"remodeling conjecture\" [5, 27] to which we now\nturn to.\n\n2.4\n\nThe remodeling conjecture\n\nThe remodeling conjecture [5, 27] is an application of the Eynard-Orantin recursion in the\nworld of Gromov-Witten theory and mirror symmetry. Roughly speaking, the statement\nof the conjecture is that if we apply the Eynard-Orantin recursion to the complex curve\n\u03a3 mirror to a toric Calabi-Yau threefold X, the Wgn and Fg constructed by the recursion\ncompute respectively the open and closed genus g amplitudes of B-model topological string\ntheory on \u03a3, which are mirror to the open and closed generating functions of GromovWitten invariants of X.\n\n2.4.1\n\nThe Eynard-Orantin recursion on mirror curves\n\nLet us now be a little more precise. We explained how to construct the mirror curves \u03a3 in\nsubsection 2.2. Now we want to apply the Eynard-Orantin topological recursion, described\nin subsection 2.3 to these mirror curves.\nThe first thing to notice is that the mirror curves are slightly different from the affine\ncurves used to define the Eynard-Orantin recursion.\n\n12\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\nV. Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\nFirst, the mirror curves \u03a3 are families of curves, depending on the parameters ri ,\ni = 1, . . . , k. This means that the differentials Wng will depend on the ri , and the Fg will\nalso be functions of the ri .\nSecond, the mirror curves are algebraic curves in (C\u2217 )2 instead of C2 . Nevertheless,\nwe can still apply the Eynard-Orantin recursion, if we replace the one-form \u03c9(q) by its\n3\nC\u2217 version \u03c9(q) = log y(q) dx(q)\nx(q) . This being said, the fact that the mirror curves are in\n(C\u2217 )2 has important consequences for properties of the meromorphic differentials and free\nenergies constructed through the recursion.\n\n2.4.2\n\nStatement of the conjecture\n\nWe can now state the remodeling conjecture more precisely. Its statement could be split\nin two parts:\nConjecture 1 (Remodeling conjecture [5, 27]). Let \u03a3f be the framed mirror curve to a\ntoric Calabi-Yau threefold X.\n1. The free energies Fg constructed by the Eynard-Orantin recursion are mapped by the\nmirror map to the genus g generating functions of Gromov-Witten invariants of X.\n2. The correlation functions Wgn are mapped by the open/closed mirror map to the\ngenerating functions of framed open Gromov-Witten invariants.\nRemark. Note that we did not define open Gromov-Witten invariants in this paper; henceforth we will concentrate on the first part of the conjecture, involving the Fg and the\nstandard Gromov-Witten invariants.\nThe conjecture has been tested computationally for many toric geometries (see for\ninstance [5, 6, 8, 27]). For the simplest case X = C3 , it has been proved that the correlation\nfunctions obtained through the recursion reproduce the topological vertex calculation [9,\n36, 37]. A proof for the resolved conifold is provided in [10] (although it does not address\nthe constant terms). A general proof of the conjecture (aside from constant terms again)\nwas outlined in [12, 13], although a few gaps remain. The special case of Hurwitz numbers\n[7], which can be seen as a consequence of the remodeling conjecture, has been proved in\n[4, 14].\n\n2.4.3\n\nConstant maps\n\nHowever, one subtle point was not addressed carefully in the original conjecture and subsequent work. According to the remodeling conjecture, the free energies Fg should be mapped\nto the generating functions of Gromov-Witten invariants. As we saw in subsection 2.1, the\nleading term in the generating functions of Gromov-Witten invariants Fg correspond to\nthe contribution from constant maps with \u03b2 = 0, Ng,0 , see (2.13). Then one could ask:\n3\n\nEquivalently, we could work in exponential variables, in which case the one-form would remain ydx.\n\n13\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\nV. Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\nQuestion. Is the remodeling conjecture true for the whole free energies Fg , including the\nconstant terms, or just for the reduced free energies Fg\u03b26=0 ? In other words, are the Fg\nconstructed from the Eynard-Orantin recursion, when we set the parameters ri = 0, giving\nthe same constant terms Ng,0 as in Gromov-Witten theory?\nAs far as we are aware, all the checks and proofs of the remodeling conjecture so far only\ninvolved non-constant terms, since they compared with the topological vertex, which only\ncomputes the reduced Gromov-Witten theory. In this paper we argue that the answer to\nthe above question is a surprising yes: the Fg constructed by the recursion, miraculously,\ncompute precisely the constant terms in Gromov-Witten theory! This is surprising for\nvarious reasons, as mentioned in the introduction. But interestingly, it turns out that it is\ndue to the particular geometry of mirror curves. Let us now see how it goes.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nContributions for constant maps\n\nThe role of the ramification points\n\nBefore we address the computation of constant terms for general toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, we need to understand the geometry of mirror curves a little better, and the relation\nbetween this geometry and the form of the Eynard-Orantin recursion. One particular thing\nwhich is rather puzzling is the role of the ramification points of the x-map. Those are fundamental from the recursion point of view, but seem to come out of nowhere from a mirror\nsymmetry standpoint. Let us now see how they can interpreted geometrically.\nRecall that a mirror curve \u03a3 is an algebraic curve in (C\u2217 )2 ; its associated Riemann\nsurface has a certain number of punctures.\nLemma 1. Let \u03a3 be a curve mirror to a toric Calabi-Yau threefold X. Let n be the number\nof ramification points (which are all simple) of the x-map x : \u03a3 \u2192 C\u2217 . Assume that the\nx-map is a branched covering. Then\nn = \u03c7(X) = number of torus fixed points of X.\n\n(3.1)\n\nIn particular, the number of ramification points does not depend on the degree of the x-map.\nProof. The lemma is a consequence of the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. Recall that given a\nbranched covering f : X \u2192 Y between (not necessarily compact) Riemann surfaces, the\nRiemann-Hurwitz formula tells us that\n\u03c7(X) = d\u03c7(Y ) \u2212 b,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere d is the degree of f , \u03c7(X) and \u03c7(Y ) are the topological Euler characteristics, and b\nis the branching index. In our case, assuming that the map x is a branched covering and\nthat its ramification locus is composed of n simple ramification points, we get\n\u03c7(\u03a3) = d\u03c7(C\u2217 ) \u2212 n.\n14\n\n(3.3)\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\nV. Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\nBut \u03c7(C\u2217 ) = 2 \u2212 2g(C\u2217 ) \u2212 2 = 0, hence\nn = \u2212\u03c7(\u03a3).\n\n(3.4)\n\nIn particular, n does not depend on the degree d of the x-map.\nNow any \u03a3 has a pair of pants decomposition, and \u03c7(\u03a3) is equal to the number of pair\nof pants times the Euler characteristic of a pair of pants (a thrice punctured sphere), which\nis \u22121. But recall that \u03a3 can be seen as fattening the toric diagram of X (see figure 1),\nhence each pair of pants correspond to a trivalent vertex of the toric diagram. Therefore,\nif we let V be the number of vertices in the toric diagram of X, we obtain \u03c7(\u03a3) = \u2212V .\nHence n = V = number of torus fixed points of X = \u03c7(X).\nRemark. Note that this result is special to the case of curves in (C\u2217 )2 . For affine curves in\nC2 as originally considered by Eynard and Orantin, the number of ramification points of\ncourse depends on the degree of the map, as can be seen by applying Riemann-Hurwitz to\nthat case.\nSo what we have found is that the ramification points of the x-map are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with the torus fixed points of X. Hence, taking residues at the ramification\npoints in the x-map seems to be a direct B-model mirror the A-model localization of\nGromov-Witten invariants with respect to the torus action. It would be very nice to make\nthis analogy more precise.\nMoreover, what we have seen is that the ramification points are also in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with the pair of pants in the decomposition of the Riemann surface \u03a3;\nthere is one ramification point on each pair of pants. Therefore, it seems that there is a\npair of pant decomposition built in the residue process of the topological recursion. At\neach step of the recursion, we are summing over residues at the ramification points; in\nother words, we are summing over contributions from each pair of pants. This also has\nan analog in the A-model; by the fattening prescription, the pair of pants decomposition\nof \u03a3 is equivalent to breaking the toric diagram along its internal edges. But in GromovWitten theory the topological vertex theory is precisely built by gluing C3 patches, which\ncorrespond to decomposing the toric diagram along internal edges. Hence the residue\nprocess can be seen as an analog decomposition on the B-model side, where the C3 patch\ndecomposition of X is replaced by a pair of pant decomposition of \u03a3. We will make this\nremark more precise for constant terms in the following.\nFinally, note that there is a very important assumption included in the statement of the\nlemma, which is that the x-map has to be a branched covering; otherwise one cannot use\nRiemann-Hurwitz directly. But is this assumption satisfied for mirror curves? Interestingly,\nwe can show that it is satisfied for framed mirror curves \u03a3f , but only for a generic choice\nof framing f , as we prove below. However, there may exist a finite number of values of f\nfor which it is not satisfied. For these pathological choices of framing, what happens is that\nthe map fails to be a branched covering at a finite number of points in C\u2217 (for instance it\n15\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\nV. Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\nmay not be surjective). We can still apply Riemann-Hurwitz, but we first need to take care\nof these points either by removing them or plugging in some punctures in \u03a3; the result is\nthen that the number of ramification points of the x-map becomes less than \u03c7(X).\nAs a consequence, it turns out that, as we will see, for these pathological choices of\nframing the recursion does not produce the right free energies Fg . This is rather striking,\nsince, as explained in [5], the framing transformation is a symplectic transformation (in\ndy\n\u2217 2\nthe sense that it preserves the symplectic form dx\nx \u2227 y on (C ) ), hence the Fg should be\ninvariant under framing transformations, according to [15, 16, 17]. What happens is that if\nwe compute the Fg for the framed curve \u03a3f , treating f as a parameter, then the resulting\nFg do not depend on f . So they are invariant in this sense, but the calculation must be\ndone treating f as a parameter to get the right answer. As a result, framing becomes an\nessential part of the calculation, and can be understood as some sort of \"regularization\"\nprocedure for the mirror curve.\nLet us now prove that the assumption is satisfied for framed mirror curves, for a generic\nchoice of framing.\nLemma 2. Let \u03a3f be a framed mirror curve. Then, for generic choice of framing f , the\nmap x : \u03a3f \u2192 C\u2217 is a branched covering.\nProof. To construct the mirror curve, we do the reparameterization\n(x, y) = (XY \u2212f , Y ).\n\n(3.5)\n\nThe unframed curve always has the form\n1+x+y+\n\nk\nX\n\nri xmi y ni = 0,\n\n(3.6)\n\ni=1\n\nfor some integers mi and ni . After the framing reparameterization, the curve becomes\n1 + XY \u2212f + Y +\n\nk\nX\n\nri (XY \u2212f )mi Y ni = 0.\n\n(3.7)\n\ni=1\n\nLet d be the degree of the map X : \u03a3f \u2192 C\u2217 . The map will be a branched covering if,\nafter removing the set of branch points in C\u2217 and the set of ramification points in \u03a3f , the\nresulting map is a covering. That is, for all p \u2208 C\u2217 not in the branching locus, X \u22121 (p) \u2208 \u03a3f\nconsists in exactly d points.\nGenerically, given a X the curve becomes a degree d polynomial in Y , hence the preimage generically consists in d points in \u03a3f . However, the X-map may fail to be a branched\ncovering if for a given f , there exists a X \u2208 C\u2217 such that either the term of highest or\nlowest degree in Y vanishes (in the former case, we lose a point in the preimage, while in\nthe latter case one of the points in the preimage goes to Y = 0 which is a puncture of \u03a3f ).\n16\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\nV. Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\nThis will happen if there are two highest or lowest degree terms in Y with different powers\nof X. It is easy to enumerate the possible such \"bad\" choices of f , which depend on the\nparticular integers mi and ni . The point is that for any framed mirror curve, there is only\na finite number of such bad f , hence the map is a branched cover for a generic f .\nLet us illustrate the role of framing with a simple example.\nExample 7. As an example of this issue with framing, consider the framed curve mirror\nto C3 , (2.25):\nn\no\n\u03a3f = H(X, Y ) := X + Y f + Y f +1 = 0 \u2282 (C\u2217 )2 .\n(3.8)\nThe curve \u03a3f has three punctures. Hence \u03c7(\u03a3f ) = 2 \u2212 3 = \u22121, and since \u03c7(C3 ) = 1, we\nindeed have that \u03c7(\u03a3f ) = \u2212\u03c7(C3 ). We thus expect that the X-map should have a single\nramification point. For generic f , the ramification point is given by the unique solution (in\nC\u2217 ) of\n\u2202H(X, Y )\n= Y f \u22121 (f + (f + 1)Y ) = 0,\n(3.9)\n\u2202Y\nthat is,\nf\nY\u2217 = \u2212\n,\nX\u2217 = f f (\u22121 \u2212 f )\u22121\u2212f .\n(3.10)\nf +1\nHowever, this analysis fails for the choices of framing f = 0 and f = \u22121, since the map X\nis not a branched covering anymore. In the case of f = 0, the curve becomes\nX + Y + 1 = 0.\n\n(3.11)\n\nThe point X = \u22121 \u2208 C\u2217 has no preimage in \u03a3f under the X-map (the preimage would\nbe (\u22121, 0), which is a puncture of \u03a3f ), hence the map is not surjective. Thus it is not a\nbranched covering. It is a branched covering however from \u03a3f to C\u2217 \\ {\u22121} (of course, it\nis one-to-one), hence X has no ramification point.\nSimilarly, for f = \u22121, the curve becomes\nXY + 1 + Y = 0.\n\n(3.12)\n\nAgain, the point X = \u22121 \u2208 C\u2217 has no preimage in \u03a3f . So we lose a puncture again, and\nthe X-map has no ramification point.\nIt turns out that the mirror C3 curves are most often encountered in the literature in the\nform (3.11) or (3.12), which correspond to these bad choices of framing. Similarly, typical\nrepresentations of the conifold curve (2.21), or other curves considered in the literature,\noften correspond to pathological choices of framing. As we discuss in sec. 4.2, for such bad\nchoices of framing the topological recursion does not produce the correct free energies.\nNow that we understand the role of the ramification points and the relation with the\npair of pants decomposition of the mirror curve, let us move on to the study of constant\nterms.\n17\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\n3.2\n\nV. Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\nThe simplest toric Calabi-Yau threefold: C3\n\nWe start with the simplest toric Calabi-Yau threefold, X = C3 . In this case, the only contributions in Gromov-Witten theory are given by constant maps. From a mirror symmetry\npoint of view, there is no K\u00e4hler parameters, hence there is no r-parameter in the mirror\ncurve (that is, the mirror curve is really a curve, not a family of curves). So the question\nin subsection 2.4.3 translates in this case into the question whether the Fg computed by\nthe recursion give precisely the genus g Gromov-Witten invariants Ng,0 for constant maps\nto C3 .\n\n3.2.1\n\nCalculation of the low genus invariants\n\nLet us apply the topological recursion to the mirror curve of C3 .

We cannot prove this conjecture at the moment, but we hope\nto report on it. If the conjecture is true, it would complete the proof of the full remodeling\nconjecture for the case of X = C3 ; the second part of the conjecture, dealing with the\ncorrelation functions, has already been proved by Chen and Zhou [9, 36]. Note that it may\nbe possible to prove this conjecture using very recent results of Eynard [11].\n\n3.3\n\nContributions for constant maps for all toric Calabi-Yau threefolds\n\nIn this section we argue that for a general toric Calabi-Yau threefold X, the constant terms\nNg,0 are equal to n times the Fg of the vertex, where n is the number of ramification points.\nIn other words, we conjecture that:\nConjecture 3. Let X be a toric Calabi-Yau threefold, and \u03a3f its framed mirror curve.\nLet FgX be the free energies computed from the Eynard-Orantin recursion applied to \u03a3f .\nThen\n3\nlim FgX = nFgC ,\n(3.29)\nri \u21920\n\nC3\n\nwhere the Fg\n\nare the free energies computed from the curve mirror to C3 .\n\nThus, for constant terms we obtain a pair of pants decomposition of the free energies,\n3\nwhere each pair of pants contributes a single copy of FgC .\nNote that conjecture 2 and 3 together imply that for all toric Calabi-Yau threefolds X,\nthe constant terms in the Fg computed by the recursion are the same ones as in GromovWitten theory (refer to subsection 2.1.3).\nWe checked this conjecture computationally, at low genus, in various toric geometries.\nIn what follows we will also give a general argument supporting this conjecture, and then\nprove it in the simple case when X is the resolved conifold. We plan to report on a proof\nfor arbitrary toric geometry soon.\n\n3.3.1\n\nRamification points vs. C3 patches \u2013 examples\n\nIn this subsection we illustrate, firstly, a correspondence between ramification points and\ntorus fixed points (or equivalently toric vertices used to built a toric diagram). Secondly,\nwe argue that, as a consequence of this fact, each C3 patch \u2013 or pair of pants \u2013 contributes\n3\na factor of FgC to the constant part of the free energy.\nWe recall that a toric diagram is dual to the Newton polygon, which can be read off from\nthe equation of the mirror curve. After appropriate triangulation of the Newton polygon, it\n20\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\nV. Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\nconsists of triangular patches which are in one-to-one correspondence with trivalent vertices\nof the toric diagram. From lemma 1 proved in section 3.1, these patches and vertices are\nalso in one-to-one correspondence with ramification points of the mirror curve (for generic\nframing). Below we demonstrate how, upon relevant rescalings of variables in the mirror\ncurve equation, and taking infinite limit of K\u00e4hler parameters, one can get rid of all but\none ramification points, and reduce the curve to the local neighbourhood of such a single\nramification point of his or her choice. In this limit the remnant of the original curve is just\nthe mirror C3 curve, whose ramification point can be identified with the single ramification\npoint which survived the above limit. This is similar to the subtlety described after lemma\n1 in section 3.1; however then losing a ramification point was a feature of a pathological\nchoice of framing, while presently it is a natural consequence of the limit which we consider,\nand the fact that in this limit the corresponding parameters Q are set to zero in the mirror\ncurve equation.\nLet us consider now the behavior of constant contributions Z \u03b2=0 to the partition function in the above limit. By definition these contributions do not change when parameters\nQ are varied. However they will change discontinuousely when, in the above decoupling\nlimit, some parameters Q are set strictly to zero, so that we lose corresponding ramification\npoints. As we argue below, we can take such a decoupling limit in various ways, in order to\nfocus on local neighoburhood of a chosen ramification point. As each such neighbourhood\ncan be identified with the mirror C3 curve, its contribution to the total partition function\n3\nwill be that of FgC . If we take a decoupling limit in which such a ramification point is\n3\nnot lost, it will still contribute FgC . If we take a limit so that we lose this point, the\n3\ncorresponding FgC factor will drop out of the computation. We can also start with a single\n3\nC3 mirror curve, whose free energy is FgC , and consider the opposite process, in which\nwe turn on certain (combination of) Q parameters, and build up more general curve, by\nbringing in additional ramification points to the picture. Each such new ramification point\n3\nwill contribute FgC to the free energy of the more general curve. In consequence, if the\nmirror curve we wish to consider has n ramification points, in total they will contribute\n3\nnFgC to the partition function, in agreement with (3.29).\nInstead of being general, we illustrate now how this mechanism works in some examples.\nTo start with we note that even for a single C3 patch, whose toric diagram involves a single\ntrivalent vertex and the Newton polygon consists of a single triangular patch, the form of\nthe corresponding single branch point depends on a particular form of the mirror curve.\nFor example, for the curve H(x, y) = 1 + x + y = 0 given in (2.20), the Newton polygon and\nthe dual toric diagram are shown in the left panel in fig. 2. For another parametrization\nH 0 (x, y) = x + y + xy = 0 the Newton polygon and the toric diagram are shown in the right\npanel. Regularizing these curves by introducing framing x \u2192 XY f we get respectively4\nH\u2212f (X, Y ) = 1 + Y + XY f ,\n4\n\n0\nH\u2212f\n(X, Y ) = Y + XY f + XY f +1 ,\n\nNote that this corresponds to the framing \u2212f in the definition (2.23).\n\n21\n\n(3.30)\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\nV.

Therefore their free energies should be the same and equal\n3\nto FgC ; we also checked that this is the case by explicit computations.\n\nFigure 2: Toric diagrams for C3 , corresponding to H(x, y) and H 0 (x, y) discussed in the text, involve a single trivalent vertex. There is a single corresponding branch point, whose regularized form, for the two forms of C3 in our\nexample, is presented in (3.31).\n\nLet us discuss now the behavior of ramification points in case of the conifold. We\nwill also consider two forms of such curve, however related by a very simple symplectic\ntransformation, involving just a multiplication of X or Y by a constant. Therefore, even\nthough the equations for two such curves are different, there is an obvious one-to-one\ncorrespondence between their ramification points. To start with, we introduce the notation\nX = rxy \u22121 , Y = y and Q = r\u22121 for the curve in (2.21), so that the mirror curve equation\ne\ntakes the form H(X,\nY ) = 1 + X + Y + QXY = 0. The Newton polygon consists of two\ntriangular patches, and the dual toric diagram involves two trivalent vertices, as shown in\nfig. 3.

In this representation, after the decoupling\n3\nlimit has been taken, the remaining contribution to the free energy will also be that of FgC\n0 .\nfor the remaining ramification point Ye\u2217,\u2212\nWe therefore showed that in appropriate decoupling limits the conifold curve reduces\nto some version of the C3 curve, and correspondingly each of its two ramification points\n3\ncontributes one factor of FgC . Therefore such contributions must be present simultaneously\nif the decoupling limits is not taken, and the constant contributions of the conifold mirror\n3\ncurve must be equal to 2FgC , in agreement with (3.29). For the conifold we prove that this\nis indeed the case in the next section.\nIt is also clear that the above mechanism can be generalized to arbitrary toric manifolds.\nFor example, the local P1 \u00d7 P1 geometry is encoded in the mirror curve\n\nb \u2212f (X, Y ) = 1 + Y + XY f + Q1 + Q2 ,\nH\nY\nXY f\n\n(3.38)\n\nwith Q1 and Q2 representing K\u00e4hler parameters of the two independent two-cycles. There\nare 4 ramification points, and the corresponding Newton polygon and toric diagram, shown\n(for f = 0) in fig. 4, consist respectively of 4 triangles and 4 trivalent vertices. By\nappropriate rescaling of X and Y and subsequently taking the limit Q1 , Q2 \u2192 0, one\ncan focus on any of the 4 patches of C3 . In particular, taking Q1 , Q2 \u2192 0 directly in\n(3.38), the curve (3.38) reduces to Hf (X, Y ) in (3.30). At the same time we focus on the\npatch highlighted in grey in fig. 4, which is nothing but the patch in the left panel in fig.\n2, and the surviving ramification point reduces to Y\u2217 in (3.31). This ramification point\n3\ncontributes one factor of FgC to the partition function. Considering various decoupling\nlimits, analogously as in the conifold case, we can focus on the neighbourhood of each of\n24\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\nV. Bouchard and P.

It is also clear that in the limit r \u2192 0,\nthe curve becomes just the curve mirror to C3 (compare with (3.13)). Thus, it is clear that\n\u0013\n\u0012\n(\u22121)g\n3\ng\nRes \u03a6(t)W1 (t) = FgC .\n(3.45)\nlim\nr\u21920 2 \u2212 2g t=a0\nThe question is what happens for the residue at the other ramification point a1 , since at\nr \u2192 0 we have that a1 \u2192 0, which is a puncture of the Riemann surface (hence \u03a6(t) is not\nwell defined there because of logarithms).\nBut it turns out that the curve \u03a3f has a nice symmetry which comes to the rescue.\nConsider reparameterizing the curve by\nw=\n\na0 a1\nr\n= ,\nt\nt\n\n(3.46)\n\nwhere we used the fact that a0 a1 = r. This reparameterization clearly exchanges the\ntwo ramification points, i.e., t = a1 corresponds to w = a0 and vice-versa.

Note that what we proved for the conifold is much stronger than lemma 3. We\nproved that for every Fg , the two pairs of pants in the decomposition of the curve \u03a3f (i.e.\nthe two ramification points) give precisely the same contribution to the full Fg , not just\nfor constant terms. Hence there really is a pair of pant decomposition here, at the level\nof the full free energy. However, this is probably an artefact of the nice symmetry of the\ncurve \u03a3f ; we expect this decomposition to hold only for constant terms for a general toric\nCalabi-Yau threefold. Note also that this lemma completes the proof of the full remodeling\nconjecture for the conifold, since the reduced part was proved in [10].\n\n3.4\n\nBeyond constant maps \u2013 remodeling conjecture for the total free\nenergy\n\nAt this point it is clear that a proper understanding of the remodeling conjecture (given in\nsection 2.4.2) should involve both constant contributions, as well as non-constant contributions. In other words, our results strongly support the claim, that the partition function\ncomputed by the topological recursion reproduces the full Gromov-Witten partition function given in (2.12). This claim follows by combining tests for non-constant contributions\nalready present in the literature, which we mentioned in the introduction, with our results\nfor constant contributions. It is instructive to illustrate this claim in at least one example.\nLet us therefore consider the total term F2 for the resolved conifold.\nRegarding constant contributions to F2 , our results, in particular the proof in section\n3.3.2, assert that they are given by twice the contribution (2.14) (with g = 2). On the\n28\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\nV. Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\nother hand, it is known that the non-constant part of the free energies for the conifold, for\ng \u2265 2, are given by polylogarithms:\nFg\u03b26=0 = (\u22121)g+1\n\nB2g\nLi3\u22122g (Q).\n2g(2g \u2212 2)!\n\n(3.67)\n\nTherefore the total genus two Gromov-Witten free energy for the conifold reads\nF2GW =\n\n1\n1\n+\nLi\u22121 (Q).\n2880 240\n\n(3.68)\n\nOn the other hand an explicit application of the topological recursion for the conifold\nmirror curve results in\n1 + 10Q + Q2\nF2 =\n.\n(3.69)\n2880(1 \u2212 Q)2\nBoth these results indeed agree\nF2GW = F2 .\n\n4\n\n(3.70)\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this paper we studied the free energies constructed from the Eynard-Orantin recursion\nfor mirror curves. We showed that there is a pair of pants decomposition built in the\nrecursion, through the residue calculation at the ramification points. We argued that the\nconstant terms computed from the recursion agree with the constant terms obtained in\nGromov-Witten theory. This follows from the pair of pant decomposition of the mirror\ncurves. In consequence, we extended the scope of the remodeling conjecture to the full free\nenergies.\nThis work however opens up a certain number of questions. Here are a few:\n\n4.1\n\nLimit theorem\n\nIn [15, section 8], limits of families of curves are also studied. Roughly speaking, what\nthey obtain is that the recursive construction of the Fg commutes with the limit on the\ncurve. Their setup is however different from ours; they consider a limit where a branch\npoint becomes singular.\nIn the case studied in this paper, what we obtained is that the limit ri \u2192 0 does not\ncommute with the recursion. Indeed, if \u03a3X is the curve mirror to X,\n\u0014\n\u0015\nX\nX\nlim Fg [\u03a3 ] 6= Fg lim \u03a3 ,\n(4.1)\nri \u21920\n\nri \u21920\n\nby which we mean that the ri \u2192 0 limit of the Fg of a given mirror curve \u03a3X are not the\nsame as the Fg of the curve with ri = 0. More precisely, it is easy to see from the definition\n29\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\nV. Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\n3\n\nthat for any mirror curve, after setting ri = 0 the curve \u03a3X reduces to the curve \u03a3C mirror\n3\nto C3 . So Fg [limri \u21920 \u03a3] = Fg [\u03a3C ]. But what we argued in the previous section is that\n3\n\nlim Fg [\u03a3X ] = nFg [\u03a3C ],\n\nri \u21920\n\n(4.2)\n\nthat is, there is an all important multiplicative factor of n, which is the number of pair of\npants in \u03a3X .\nSo in our context, the recursive construction does not commute with the limit ri \u2192 0.\nIt would be interesting to compare more precisely with the limit theorem of [15], even\nthough the setups are different. It would also be interesting to see whether the kind of\nlimit statement that we obtained is a property of mirror curves, or whether it holds for\ngeneral curves in C\u2217 , using the relation with pair of pants decompositions.\n\n4.2\n\nSymplectic invariance\n\nIn [15, 16, 17] it is stated that the free energies Fg constructed from the recursion are invariant under the group of transformations of the maps x and y that preserve the symplectic\ndy\nform dx \u2227 dy (in the C\u2217 context, the symplectic form is dx\nx \u2227 y ).\nFrom the form of the recursion, invariance is clear for any transformation which does\nnot modify the ramification points of the x-map. The tricky part of the statement is\nfor transformations that do modify the ramification points, in particular transformations\nthat change the number of ramification points. Invariance under these transformations was\napparently shown in [16].\nHowever, as we argued in subsection 3.1, from our study of framing it became clear\nthat the Fg are not strictly invariant under framing transformations, which is a particular\ntype of symplectic transformations. If we treat f as a parameter, then one can show that\nthe Fg obtained from the recursion do not depend on f . However, there exists specific\nchoices of framing for which the recursion does not produce the same Fg . This is because\nsome framing transformations change the number of ramification points, hence accordingly\nchange the constant terms of the Fg . A simple example was shown in example 7; for the\nchoices of framing f = 0, \u22121, the X-map has simply no ramification points, hence produces\nFg that are trivially zero, while for a generic choice of framing the Fg are surely non-zero.\nAs a result, we argued that we should treat the framing f as a parameter, and see it as\nsome sort of regularization procedure. In this sense, \"symplectic invariance\" is somewhat\nrestored since the Fg do not depend on f , but strictly speaking the recursion produces\ndifferent results for different choices of framing.\nIt is then worth asking whether this is a consequence of the fact that mirror curves are\ncurves in (C\u2217 )2 , while the curves initially considered by Eynard and Orantin were affine\ncurves, and the proof of [16] may only apply to the latter. Let us study this question\nfurther.\n\n30\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\n4.2.1\n\nV. Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\nA counterexample\n\nIt turns out that a similar phenomenon that we encountered with framing occur for much\nsimpler curves, such as standard affine curves in C2 . Let us study a very simple counterexample to the statement that the Fg are invariant under symplectic transformations.\nConsider the affine curve\nH(x, y) = y 2 \u2212 yx + 1 = 0.\n\n(4.3)\n\nThis curve has been studied for instance in [32] (see also [33, section 5.1]). The x-map\nhas two ramification points at (2, 1) and (\u22122, \u22121). The Fg can be computed; they are the\norbifold Euler characteristics of the moduli spaces of genus g curves [32, Theorem 1]:\nFg = \u03c7(Mg ).\n\n(4.4)\n\nIn particular, they are clearly non-zero.\nNow consider the symplectic transformation (x, y) 7\u2192 (x0 , y 0 ) = (y, \u2212x), which preserves\ndx \u2227 dy = dx0 \u2227 dy 0 . The curve becomes\nG(x0 , y 0 ) = x02 + x0 y 0 + 1 = 0.\n\n(4.5)\n\nThe x0 -map has of course no ramification points, it is a one-to-one map. Hence if we\napply the recursion to this new x0 -map, the free energies Fg vanish identically! Clearly,\nthey are not invariant under this particular symplectic transformation, since they were\nnon-vanishing in the original parameterization. The problem is that the transformation\nchanges the number of ramification points.\n\n4.2.2\n\nSPP geometry\n\nIt should be noted that this problem with symplectic transformations does not appear only\nwhen the newly parameterized curve has no ramification points. It also appears when the\nnumber of ramification points changes but remains non-zero.\nFor instance, consider the mirror curve to the SPP geometry studied in [35] in sec. 3.2,\nwhich is of the form Q1 y 2 + xy + x + (1 + Q1 Q2 )y + Q2 = 0. The x-map from this mirror\ncurve has two ramification points. We computed the Fg from this curve, and extracted the\nconstant terms. What we obtained is that the constant terms Ng,0 are twice the Fg of C3 ,\nconsistent with the fact that there are two ramification points.\nHowever, according to the general formulae in Gromov-Witten theory (2.16), the constant terms Ng,0 should be three times the Fg of C3 , since the Euler characteristic of the\nSPP geometry is \u03c7(X) = 3.\nWhat happens is that the choice of framing in which the curve is presented in [35] is\none of these pathological choices of framing. It turns out that the general framed curve\nhas indeed three ramification points, the same number as \u03c7(X), as expected. Thus, for\n31\n\n\fTopological recursion and mirror curves\n\nV. Bouchard and P. Sulkowski\n\nthe framed curve we get the right constant terms Ng,0 , which indeed do not depend on the\nframing f . But to get the right answer one first needs to regularize the curve by introducing\nframing; otherwise we do not get the right answer.\nRemark. Indeed, for mirror curves, for any choice of parameterization such that the number\nof ramification points is not equal to \u03c7(X), we will not get the right constant terms, from\nour results of the previous sections. But after regularizing the curve by introducing framing,\nthe number of ramification points will be equal to \u03c7(X), and the constant terms will match\nthe expected numbers Ng,0 from Gromov-Witten theory.\n\n4.2.3\n\nModify the recursion?\n\nOf course, symplectic invariance is one of the most desirable property of the Fg . But as\nwe saw, there exists some symplectic transformations such that the newly parameterized\ncurve does not produce the same invariants than the old curve. The examples that we\ngave all involve transformations that change the number of ramification points. It would\nbe important to clarify which subgroup of transformations precisely are problematic.\nBut what would be even nicer is to modify the formulation of the recursion in order\nto restore explicit symplectic invariance. That is, rewrite the recursion such that for any\ntwo curves related by a symplectic transformation, the Fg computed by the recursion are\nequal. Perhaps what one needs to do is take into account explicitly the ramification points\nof both the x and y map simultaneously, or projectivize the curve in P2 in order to work\nin a compact setup.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
