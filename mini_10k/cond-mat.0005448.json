INTRODUCTION\n\nThere are two ways to generate on the lattice a sample with the randomly occupied sites [1] . The first one, with\nthe fixed number s of occupied sites. This is the sampling from a 'canonical ensemble' for which in this paper we will\nuse the name s-sampling. The second way, with a fixed probability p for a given site to be occupied, i.e. sampling\nfrom a 'grand canonical ensemble', or p-sampling. It is known that both methods lead in the 'thermodynamic' limit\nof infinite lattice size to the same results for the free energy per Ising spin being placed onto occupied sites of the\nlattice [2].\nIf one choose the probability p for the site to be occupied the concentration of bonds between the occupied sites\non the infinite lattice are nSS = p2 . We named this bonds as SS-bonds. Similarly, the concentration of bonds\nbetween non-occupied sites (N N -bonds) is nN N = (1 \u2212 p)2 and the concentration of bonds between occupied and\nnon-occupied sites (SN -bonds) are nSN = 2p(1 \u2212 p). Clearly, the sum of the three concentrations nSS + nN N + nSN\nis the probability that each bond belongs to one of the three types and equal to unity.\nIn this paper we asking the following questions: i) how fluctuates the concentration of bonds on the hypercubic\nlattices depending on the concentration of occupied sites? ii) how this fluctuations depend on the way of sampling?\niii) how this fluctuations depend on the lattice size?\nWe found analytically the answers on the all of the stated questions.\nWe start our analyses with the simple case of one-dimensional periodic lattice in Section II. In Section III we\ncalculated the mean value and the variance of the number of bonds for the square lattice using the results of Section II.\nIn the following Section IV we genelarize our results for the d-dimensional hypercubic lattice. We conclude our paper\nwith the discussion of results in Section V.\nII. ONE-DIMENSIONAL LATTICE\nA. s-sampling\n\nLet us consider an one-dimensional lattice with L sites and periodic boundary (i.e. ring).\nWe are interested in the probability P (b; s, L) to have b bonds between s occupied sites. The number of occupied\nsites s, the number of bonds between occupied sites b and the number of clusters of occupied sites k are connected\nby relation\nk = s \u2212 b.\n\n(1)\n\nThen, the probability could be easily written as\nP (b; s, L) =\n\nk\u22121 k\u22121\nLCs\u22121\nCL\u2212s\u22121\n,\nkCLs\n\n1\n\n(2)\n\n\fk\u22121\nk\u22121\nwhere combinatorial coefficients Cs\u22121\nis the number of dispositions of s sites among the k clusters, CL\u2212s\u22121\n- the same\ns\nfor L \u2212 s empty sites, CL - number of configurations with the s occupied sites from L possibilities, and, finally, L/k the number of positions of k clusters on L sites.

SQUARE LATTICE\n\nLet us calculate the mean value of the number of bonds and it's variation for the square lattice with periodic\nboundary conditions.\nA. p-sampling\n\nOn the square lattice with periodic boundaries, there are L2 vertical and L2 horizontal bonds. The number of\nbonds in each of L columns and each of L rows are the random variables. Their mean values hbi\u2032i are given by (10)\nand their variances by (11). Thus, the mean value of the number of bonds on 2d lattice are\n\u2032\n\nhbid=2 =\n\n2L\nX\n\n\u2032\n\nhbii = 2Lp2 .\n\n(12)\n\ni=1\n\nand their variance are given by [3]\n\u2206b\u2032d=2 =\n\n2L\nX\n\n\u2206b\u2032 + 2\n\n2L\nX\ni,j\n\ni=1\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nCov hbi\u2032i , hbi\u2032j\n\n(13)\n\nwhere i < j.\nIt is clear that the column-column (row-row) covariances are equal to zero, and the column-row covariances are the\nsame for all columns and rows, and\n\u0001\n\u2206b\u2032d=2 = 2L2 p2 (1 \u2212 p)(1 + 3p) + 2L2 Cov hbi\u2032column , hbi\u2032row .\n(14)\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nWe have to compute now the column-row covariance Cov hbicolumn , hbirow\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\nCov hbi\u2032column , hbi\u2032row = hbi\u2032column hbi\u2032row \u2212 hbi\u20322 .\n\n(15)\n\nhbi\u2032column hbi\u2032row = p hb|x\u2217 = occupiedi2 + (1 \u2212 p) hb|x\u2217 = unoccupiedi2\n\n(16)\n\nThe first average are splitted into two parts. The first one, corresponds to all cases of distribution of occupied sites\non columns and rows with the constraint that the intersection of row and column x\u2217 are occupied. The second one,\ncorresponds to the states with the unoccupied intersection site.\n\nWe omit here the algebra leading to the final expression for the variation of the number of sites on the twodimensional lattice with the given probability p for the site to be occupied\n\u2206b\u2032d=2 = 2L2 p2 (1 \u2212 p)(1 + 7p).\n\n(17)\n\nDetails will be published elsewhere [4].\n\nB. s-sampling\n\nWe calculate also the mean value of the number of bonds on the square lattice with the linear size L and with the\nfixed number s of occupied sites\n2s(s \u2212 1)\nL2 \u2212 1\n\n(18)\n\ns(s \u2212 1)(L2 \u2212 s)(L2 \u2212 s \u2212 1)(2L2 \u2212 10)\n.\n(L2 \u2212 1)2 (L2 \u2212 2)(L2 \u2212 3)\n\n(19)\n\nhbid=2 =\nand the variance are\n\u2206bd=2 =\n\n3\n\n\fIV. HYPERCUBIC LATTICES\n\nThe mean value of the number of bonds on the d-dimensional hypercubic lattice with the probability p for the site\nto be occupied are\nhbid = dLd p2 .\n\u2032\n\n(20)\n\nThe variance could be calculated in the same manner as in the two dimensional d = 2 case described above in the\nSection III A\n\u2206b\u2032d = dLd p2 (1 \u2212 p)(1 + (4d \u2212 1)p) .\n\n(21)\n\nThe explicit mean value and the variance of the number of bonds for the case of the fixed number s of occupied\nsites could be calculated using (20) and (21) with the proposition that the mean value are quadratic in s.

DISCUSSION\n\nWe do not find any evidence for the absense of self-averaging [5,6] in the number of bonds. In the case of p-sampling\nthe normalized variance\nRb\u2032d =\n\n\u2206b\u2032d\n\u20322\nhbid\n\n=\n\n(1 \u2212 p)(1 + (4d \u2212 1)p)\n\u221d L\u2212d\np2 L d\n\n(24)\n\ninverse proportional to the lattice volume. Therefore the number of bonds are the strong averaging quantity [7,8].\nThe normalized variance in the case of s-sampling\nRbd =\n\n\u2206bd\n2\nhbid\n\n=\u221d\n\n(1 \u2212 ns )2\nd\ns (ns \u2212 1/L )\n\ndL\u2212d n\n\n(25)\n\nare nonmonotonic in L and the strong self-averaging take place for L > (1/ns )1/d .\nThe relative variance for two cases\n\u2206b\u2032d\np2 (1 + (4d \u2212 1)p)(1 \u2212 p)\n=\n2\n\u2206bd\n(ns (1 \u2212 ns ))\n\n(26)\n\nshows that in the limit of p \u2192 1 and ns \u2192 1 the ratio diverges.\nIt is possible to give the physical interpretation to the last expression. Let us place Ising spin at each occupied site.\nThen, the energy E0 at zero temperature will be equal to the number of bonds betwen the sites occupied by spins.\nThe magnetization M0 are equal to the number of occupied sites. Then, the ratio (26) are equal to the ratio Np /Ns\nof the number of samples (Np for the p-sampling\np and Ns for the s-smapling) over which we have to average energy\nE0 in order to get the same dispersion \u03c3E0 = \u2206b/(Nx \u2212 1) of the energy E0 , where Nx are either Np or Ns .\nFinally, we could propose the third way to generate the samples, sb-sampling: get random samples with the fixed\nnumber of sites s and choose among them only those which contain the \"right\" number of bonds b = ds2 . The\nresults of Monte Carlo simulations for site diluted Ising model on square lattice had show [4] that the dispersions\nof termodynamic quantaties like energy, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility are quite smaller for the proposed\nsb-sampling in comparison with both, s-sampling and p-sampling at all temperatures.\n4\n\n\fVI.
