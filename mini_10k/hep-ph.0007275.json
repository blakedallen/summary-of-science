Pennington\nUniversity Of Durham, Durham, DH1 3LE, U.K.\n\nABSTRACT\nI present the results of a recent calculation to determine the number of strange scalar\nresonances below 1.8 GeV based on the analytic properties of the experimental \u03c0K\nscattering amplitude. Only one resonance was found in the data, and this is readily\nidentifiable as the K0\u2217 (1430). We found no evidence to support the \u03ba(900).\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe scalar mesons are one of the most controversial subjects in hadron physics.\nIn the last edition of the PDG 1) , there were four scalar isoscalars listed below\n1.5 GeV (the f0 (400 \u2212 1200), f0 (980), f0 (1370) and f0 (1500), with a possible fifth\nat 1.7 GeV, the fJ (1710). There were also two isovectors listed, the a0 (980) and\nthe a0 (1450). This is obviously too many for a standard qq nonet. However, many\nQCD-motivated models predict the the existence of non-qq mesons, such as qqqq\nstates 2) , KK molecules 3) and glueballs 4) . It is precisely in the scalar-isoscalar\nthat these unconventional mesons are most like to be found. This excess of isoscalars\nand isovectors has led to the suggestion that there are in fact two scalar nonets 5) :\nthe conventional one centred around 1.4 GeV and an unconventional, possibly qqqq,\nTalk presented by Stuart Cherry\n\u2217\n\n\fone centred around 1 GeV. However, the PDG lists only one pair of strange scalar\nmesons in this region, the K0\u2217 (1430) and so some authors have postulated a light\nstrange meson, known as the \u03ba(900) Evidence for 6) and against 7) the \u03ba(900) has\nbeen claimed within various models. It should be kept in mind that the existence of a\nresonance is not defined by the ability to fit a particular formula to the experimental\ndata. A resonance is entirely defined by the presence of a pole of the S\u2212matrix on\nthe nearby unphysical sheet.\nI would like to present to you the results of a model-independent calcu8)\nlation\nto determine whether the \u03ba(900) is indeed present in the experimental\ndata by determining the number and positions of the poles of the S\u2212matrix. The\nmethod, due to Nagov\u00e1 et al 9) , does not require the artificial separation of data\ninto background and resonance components and I will begin by briefly outlining it.\n2\n\nMapping\n\nTo determine the position of a pole in the complex plane from data along the real\naxis we must perform some form of analytic continuation. In order to maximise the\nregion of validity of our analytic continuation we begin by conformally mapping the\nunphysical sheet of the \u03c0K partial wave amplitude (see Fig. 1) into the unit disc.\ns\n\nsc\n\nsth\n\nFigure 1:\nThe cut structure of the \u03c0K partial wave amplitude, where\nsth = (mK + m\u03c0 )2 and the radius of the circular cut is sc = m2K \u2212 m2\u03c0 .\nThe mapping is designed so that the cuts in the s\u2212plane are mapped onto\nthe circumference of the circle in the z\u2212plane. The mapping is accomplished in two\nsteps. First\np\np\n\u0012\n\u00132\ni\u03b2 y(s) \u2212 y(s) \u2212 y(sth )\ns \u2212 sc\np\ny(s) =\n,\n(1)\nand then z(s) = p\ns + sc\ni\u03b2 y(s) + y(s) \u2212 y(sth )\nwhere \u03b2 is a real number chosen to minimise the distance the continuation must\ncover. From Fig. 2 we notice that physical data could never cover the whole circle.\n\n\fWe also see that the proportion of the circle covered by each increment in s falls very\nsharply as s increases. Hence we can neglect radial excitations from our analysis.\nIm z\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\nRe z\n-1\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nFigure 2: The z-plane showing how points in s-plane map for a given \u03b2. The thicker\nline shows the arc covered by the LASS data. The symbols mark particular values of\ns: \u0007 s = sth , \u0003 s = \u221e, \u25bd s = \u2212sc , \u25e6 s = isc , \u2666 s = \u221a12 (sc + isc ), \u2022 s = sc .\n3\n\nContinuation\n\nLet Y (z) and \u01eb(z) be continuous functions describing the experimental data and\nerrors around the entire circle. If F (z) is a square-integrable function around the\ncircle, then we can test how well it describes the data through a \u03c72 defined by\n1\n\u03c7 =\n2\u03c0\n2\n\nI\n\nC\n\nF (z) \u2212 Y (z)\n\u01eb(z)\n\n2\n\n|dz| .\n\n(2)\n\nWe introduce a weight function g(z) which we define to be real analytic,\nnon-zero throughout the disc and constrained by |g(z)| = \u01eb(z) around the circle.\nExpanding our data and trial functions as Laurent series about the origin, i.e.\n\u221e\nX\nY (z)\ny(z) =\n=\nyk z k\ng(z)\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u221e\nX\nF (z)\nf (z) =\n=\nak z k\ng(z)\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\nand\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\ngives\n2\n\n\u03c7 =\n\n\u221e\nX\nk=1\n\n2\n\n(a\u2212k \u2212 y\u2212k ) +\n\n\u221e\nX\nk=0\n\n(ak \u2212 yk )2\n\n(4)\n\nThe pole structure of our partial wave amplitude, Y (z), can then be determined by\nfinding the test function F (z) which minimises the first summation in Eq. (4). Since\npartial wave amplitudes are real analytic, the coefficients ak and yk will be real.\nTo test if the amplitude is free of resonances we set a\u2212k \u2261 0 \u2200 k > 0. Then\nP\n2\n2\nthe quantity \u03c720 = \u221e\nk=1 y\u2212k will have a \u03c7 \u2212distribution.\n\n\fTo test if the amplitude contains one resonance we define\n\u1ef9(z) =\n\n\u221e\nX\nY (z)B\u03bb (z)\n=\n\u1ef9k z k\ng(z)\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere B\u03bb (z) =\n\n(z \u2212 \u03bb)(z \u2212 \u03bb\u2217 )\n(1 \u2212 z\u03bb)(1 \u2212 z\u03bb\u2217 )\n\nB\u03bb is the one resonance Blaschke pole killing factor. Now the quantity \u03c721 =\nwill have a \u03c72 \u2212distribution.\n4\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nP\u221e\n\nk=1\n\n2\n\u1ef9\u2212k\n\nInputs\n\nThe experimental inputs into our calculation are the \u03c0K scattering magnitudes,\na(s), and phases, \u03c6(s), as measured, for example, by the LASS experiment 10) . The\namplitude is normalised such that\nf I (s) =\n\na(s)ei\u03c6(s)\n\u03c1(s)\n\n,\n\n2q(s)\n\u03c1(s) = \u221a\ns\n\n(6)\n\nwhere q(s) is the centre of mass 3-momentum of the \u03c0K system and the superscript\nindicates we are on the physical sheet. In order to detect a resonance we must move\nonto the relevant unphysical sheet, this is done by swapping the sign of the phase.\nAfter mapping we have discrete data points fi (z) and errors \u2206i around a portion\nof the circle. Where the data is more densely packed the amplitude is more tightly\ncontrolled, so we weight the errors by the density of data points in that region, i.e.\np\nwe define \u01ebi = \u2206i |\u03b4zi |/2\u03c0.\nBetween threshold and the start of the data we use the LASS effective\nrange fit to create a few guide points. In the unphysical region we simply guess\na few widely spaced guide points and assign large errors. The large spacing and\nerrors will hopefully deweight these points so that they do not unduly affect the\nresults of the calculation. With these three different inputs and using the Schwarz\nReflection Principle we can cover the circle with data and then we interpolate to\ngive the continuous functions that we need.\nP\nn\nA suitable form for the weight function is g(z) = exp M\nn=1 cn z where the\ncn can be found from a Fourier cosine fit to log \u01eb(z).\nWe can now calculate the singular coefficients of our Laurent expansions\nin the usual way, i.e.\nI\nI\n1\nY (z)z k\nY (z)B\u03bb (z)z k\n1\nyk =\n|dz|\nand\n\u1ef9k =\n|dz|\n(7)\n2\u03c0 c g(z)\n2\u03c0 c\ng(z)\nWe want to find the value of \u03bb that minimises \u03c721 and then compare the final\nvalue with \u03c720 . We can carry out a similar procedure to test for two resonances and\n\n\fby comparing the various \u03c72 's we can determine the number of resonances present\nin the channel.\n5\n\nResults\n\nIn order to assess its capabilities, we began by testing the method explained previously with a trial scattering amplitude. This amplitude was created using Jost\nfunctions and had two resonances present, a \u03ba1 with mass 900 MeV and width\n500 GeV and a \u03ba2 with mass 1400 MeV and width 300 MeV. The results are shown\nin Table 1. We can see clearly that the \u03c72 falls significantly as the number of\nresonances is increased and that changing the size of the errors in the unphysical\nregion has very little effect on either of the pole positions obtained. Thus we can\nconfidently claim that the amplitude contains two resonances and furthermore the\nparameters of these resonances have been quite accurately determined.\nOption\n\n1\n\n2\n\nNo. of\nresonances\n0\n1\n2\n0\n1\n2\n\n\u221a\n\nspole\n\u03c72\n(MeV)\n4081\n1201 \u00b1 131i\n281\n1396 \u00b1 142i 903 \u00b1 234i\n0.5\n3759\n1173 \u00b1 111i\n417\n1392 \u00b1 140i 900 \u00b1 233i\n1.0\n\nTable 1: Pole positions and \u03c72 's for model data. The two options differ only in the\nsize of the errors in the unphysical region.\nTurning now to experimental data, Table 2 shows the results obtained from\nthe LASS total S-wave data. We see that the fall in \u03c72 in going from one to two\nresonances is negligible compared to the fall between zero and one resonance. Also\nthe parameters for the second resonance are quite sensitive to the size of the errors\nin the unphysical region. This suggests that the second resonance listed in Table 2\nis merely an artifact of looking for two poles and is not really present in the data.\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this talk I have tried to outline a calculation to determine the number of resonances present in strange scalar channel.

The experimental \u03c0K scattering data is found to contain only one resonance below 1.8 GeV and this state is readily identifiable with the\nK0\u2217 (1430).
