String Theory, or some form of it, considered at present as a\npromising consistent theoretical framework for such a unification at the quantum level,\nrequires extra spatial dimensions. In this higher-dimensional context, which has received\na lot of attention in the last few years [1, 2], gravity propagates in D = 4 + n dimensions (Bulk ), while all Standard Model degrees of freedom are assumed to be confined on\na four-dimensional D-Brane. In theories with large extra dimensions [1] the traditional\nPlanck scale MP l \u223c 1018 GeV is only an effective scale, related to the fundamental higherdimensional gravity scale M\u2217 through the relation MP2 l \u223c M\u2217n+2 Rn , where R \u223c (Vn )1/n is\nthe effective size of the n extra spatial dimensions. If R \u226b lP l \u2248 10\u221233 cm, the scale M\u2217\ncan be substantially lower than MP l . If M\u2217 is sufficiently low, trans-planckian particle\ncollisions could be feasible in accelerators or other environments. The product of such\ncollisions would be objects that probe the extra dimensions. Black holes are among the\npossible products of trans-planckian collisions [3]. Black holes with a horizon size rH\nsmaller than the size of extra dimensions R will be higher-dimensional objects centered\nat the brane and extending in the bulk. A classical treatment would require that the\nmass of the black hole MBH would have to be larger than the fundamental gravity scale\nM\u2217 . Such black holes can be created in ground based colliders, although their appearance in cosmic rays is possible as well (for references, see the reviews [4, 5]). A black\nhole created in such trans-planckian collisions is expected to undergo a short \"balding\"\nphase in which it will shed its additional quantum numbers, apart from charge, angular\nmomentum and mass. Then, after a more familiar Kerr-like phase, in which it will lose\nits angular momentum, a Schwarzschild phase follows during which the black hole will\ngradually lose its mass through the emission of Hawking radiation both in the bulk and\nin the brane, consisting of elementary particles of a very distinct thermal spectrum. This\nblack hole radiation has been the subject of both analytical and numerical studies. This\nincludes lower spin degrees of freedom [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] as well as graviton emission\nin the bulk [13]. The study of graviton emission in the bulk corresponds to the study of\nperturbations in a gravitational background. The formalism for the treatment of gravitational perturbations of a higher-dimensional non-rotating black hole has been developed\nin [14]. In the present article we consider the evaporation of (4 + n)-dimensional nonrotating black holes into gravitons and calculate the energy emission rate for gravitons in\nthe bulk obtaining analytical solutions of the master equation satisfied by gravitational\nperturbations. Our results, valid in the low-energy regime, are complementary to existing studies in the intermediate energy regime [13]. These results show a vector radiation\ndominance for every value of n, while the relative magnitude of the energy emission rate\nof the subdominant scalar and tensor radiation depends on n. The low-energy emission\nrate in the bulk for gravitons is well below that for a scalar field, due to the absence of\nthe dominant l = 0, 1 modes from the gravitational spectrum, although higher partial\nwaves are likely to modify this behaviour at higher energies. The calculated low-energy\nemission rate, for all types of degrees of freedom decreases with n, although the full\nenergy emission rate, integrated over all frequencies, is expected to increase with n, as\nin the previously studied case of a bulk scalar field.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nTheoretical Framework\n\nAccording to the Large Extra Dimensions scenario [1], our universe is made up of the\nusual 3+1 non-compact dimensions plus n additional, compact, spacelike ones. The gravitational background around a spherically-symmetric, neutral black hole formed in such\na (4 + n)-dimensional, flat spacetime is described by the following line-element [15]\nds2 = \u2212f (r) dt2 +\n\ndr 2\n+ r 2 d\u03a922+n ,\nf (r)\n\n(1)\n\nwith the metric function f (r) given by\nf (r) = 1 \u2212\n\n\u0010 r \u0011n+1\nH\n\nr\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nand d\u03a922+n denoting the area of the (2 + n)-dimensional unit sphere. The above black\nhole is characterized by a non-vanishing temperature given by\nTH =\n\nn+1\n,\n4\u03c0rH\n\n(3)\n\nand therefore emits Hawking radiation [6] with an energy emission rate that resembles the\none for a black body. The strong gravitational field surrounding the black hole modifies\nthe spectrum through the modification of the corresponding absorption probability |A|2,\nthat now depends on the energy \u03c9 and spin s of the emitted particle as well as on the\nnumber of extra dimensions n (see, for example, [4]). The absorption probability can be\nfound by solving the equation of motion of a particular field propagating in the vicinity of\nthe black hole and by using classical scattering theory. As mentioned in the Introduction,\nin this work, we focus on the decay of a (4 + n)-dimensional, Schwarzschild black hole\nthrough the emission of gravitons in the bulk.\nFollowing [14], a graviton in D dimensions can be decomposed into a symmetric\ntraceless tensor, a vector and a scalar part. These are further expanded in terms of the\nspin-weighted spherical harmonics on the S n+2 unit sphere. The radial parts of all three\ntypes of gravitational perturbations are found to satisfy a Schrodinger-like equation of\nthe form [14]\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\u03a6\nd\nf\n+ (\u03c9 2 \u2212 V ) \u03a6 = 0 .\n(4)\nf\ndr\ndr\nThe potential V has a different form for each type of perturbation, namely\n\u0015\n\u0014\nf (r)\nn(n + 2) k(n + 2)2 \u0010 rH \u0011n+1\nVT,V = 2 l(l + n + 1) +\n,\n(5)\n\u2212\nr\n4\n4\nr\nfor tensor- and vector-like perturbations, with k = \u22121 and k = 3 respectively, and\nVS =\n\nqx3 + px2 + wx + z\nf (r)\n,\nr 2 4 [2m + (n + 2)(n + 3)x]2\n\n(6)\n\nfor scalar gravitational perturbations, with\nm \u2261 l(l + n + 1) \u2212 n \u2212 2 ,\n\nx\u2261\n2\n\n\u0010 r \u0011n+1\nH\n\nr\n\n=1\u2212f,\n\n(7)\n\n\fand\nq \u2261 (n + 2)4 (n + 3)2 ,\nz \u2261 16m3 + 4m2 (n + 2)(n + 4) ,\n\u0002\n\u0003\np \u2261 (n + 2)(n + 3) 4m (2n2 + 5n + 6) + n(n + 2)(n + 3)(n \u2212 2) ,\n\n(8)\n\nw \u2261 \u221212m (n + 2) [m(n \u2212 2) + n(n + 2)(n + 3)] .\n\n3\n\nSolving the Field Equations\n\nIn this section, we proceed to solve analytically the above equation for all three types of\ngravitational perturbations in the vicinity of a (4 + n)-dimensional neutral, sphericallysymmetric black-hole. For this purpose, we will use a well-known approximate method\nand solve first the aforementioned equation at the two asymptotic radial regimes: close\nto the black hole horizon (r \u2243 rH ), and far away from it (r \u226b rH ). The two solutions will\nthen be stretched and matched in an intermediate zone to create a smooth analytical\nsolution extending over the whole radial regime.\n\n3.1\n\nThe Near-Horizon Regime\n\nHere, we focus on the derivation of the solution for all types of gravitational perturbations\nin the asymptotic regime close to the black hole horizon. Due to the similar form of\ntheir potential, tensor and vector perturbations will be treated together, while the scalar\nperturbations will be dealt with separately.\nA. Tensor and Vector Perturbations\nWe start by making the change of variable r \u2192 f (r), in terms of which the field equation\nfor tensor and vector perturbations can be written in the form\n\u0014\n\u0015\nd2 \u03a6\n(2n + 3)\nd\u03a6\nf (1 \u2212 f ) 2 + 1 \u2212\nf\n+\ndf\n(n + 1)\ndf\n\u0014\n\u0015\n(\u03c9rH )2\nA\nk(n + 2)2\n\u2212\n+\n\u03a6 = 0.\n(9)\n(n + 1)2 f (1 \u2212 f ) (1 \u2212 f ) 4(n + 1)2\nIn the above, k = \u22121 for tensor perturbations and k = 3 for vector ones, and we have\nalso defined for convenience the quantity\nA\u2261\n\nn(n + 2)\nl(l + n + 1)\n+\n.\n2\n(n + 1)\n4(n + 1)2\n\n(10)\n\nIf we now make the following field redefinition: \u03a6(f ) = f \u03b1 (1 \u2212 f )\u03b2 F (f ), the above\nequation takes the form of a hypergeometric equation\nf (1 \u2212 f )\n\ndF\nd2 F\n+ [c \u2212 (1 + a + b) f ]\n\u2212 ab F = 0 ,\n2\ndf\ndf\n3\n\n(11)\n\n\funder the identifications\na=\u03b1+\u03b2+\n\n(n + 2)\n+G,\n2(n + 1)\n\nb=\u03b1+\u03b2+\n\n(n + 2)\n\u2212G,\n2(n + 1)\n\nc = 1 + 2\u03b1 ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere G an arbitrary constant. Demanding further that the coefficient of F (f ) in our\nequation be indeed \u2212ab yields three more additional constraints that determine the\nremaining unknown constants, \u03b1, \u03b2 and G. Their corresponding values are found to be\nG(T, V ) =\nand\n\n(1 + k)(n + 2)\n,\n4(n + 1)\n\n1\n\u03b2=\n2(n + 1)\n\n\u001a\n\n\u03b1\u00b1 = \u00b1\n\ni\u03c9rH\n,\nn+1\n\n\u001b\nq\n2\n2\n2\n\u22121 \u00b1 (2l + n + 1) \u2212 4\u03c9 rH .\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\nThe indices of the hypergeometric equation (a, b, c) are now fully determined, which\nallows us to write the general solution of the hypergeometric equation, and thus the\nsolution in the near-horizon regime, as\n\u03a6N H (f ) = A1 f \u03b1 (1 \u2212 f )\u03b2 F (a, b, c; f )\n\n+ A2 f \u2212\u03b1 (1 \u2212 f )\u03b2 F (a \u2212 c + 1, b \u2212 c + 1, 2 \u2212 c; f ) ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere A1,2 are arbitrary integration constants. There is, however, a boundary condition\nthat this general solution must satisfy: no outgoing waves must be found right outside\nthe black-hole horizon, as nothing can escape from within this area. To ensure this, we\nexpand our solution in the limit r \u2192 rH , or equivalently f \u2192 0, in which case we find\n\u03a6N H (f ) \u2243 A1 f \u03b1 + A2 f \u2212\u03b1 = A1 e\u2212i\u03c9y + A2 ei\u03c9y ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere, in the last part of the above equation, we have used the 'tortoise-like' coordinate\nn+2\ndy\nrH\n=\n.\ndr\nf (r) r n+2\n\n(17)\n\nThe asymptotic solution is therefore written in terms of incoming and outgoing plane\nwaves, as expected, since very close to the horizon the potential V for all types of gravitational perturbations vanishes. Nevertheless, the aforementioned boundary condition\nforces us to discard the outgoing wave by setting A2 = 0, that brings the near-horizon\nsolution to its final form\n\u03a6N H (f ) = A1 f \u03b1 (1 \u2212 f )\u03b2 F (a, b, c; f ) .\n\n(18)\n\nThe only task remaining is to fix the arbitrary signs appearing in the expressions of\nboth \u03b1 and \u03b2. As we may see from Eq. (16), the interchange \u03b1+ \u2194 \u03b1\u2212 would simply\ninterchange the integration coefficients A1 \u2194 A2 , therefore the sign of \u03b1 can be chosen at\nrandom; here, we have chosen \u03b1 = \u03b1\u2212 . On the other hand, the sign in \u03b2 can be fixed by the\n1\n\u22122\u03b2 > 0,\nconvergence condition of the hypergeometric function, i.e. Re (c\u2212a\u2212b) = \u2212 n+1\nthat clearly demands that we choose \u03b2 = \u03b2\u2212 .\n4\n\n\fB. Scalar Perturbations\nBy employing the same change of variable, the field equation for scalar gravitational\nperturbations can be brought to the form\n\u0014\n\u0015\n(2n + 3)\nd\u03a6\nd2 \u03a6\nf\n+\nf (1 \u2212 f ) 2 + 1 \u2212\ndf\n(n + 1)\ndf\n\u0014\n\u0015\n(\u03c9rH )2\nz\n\u2212\n\u2212 C \u03a6 = 0 , (19)\n(n + 1)2 f (1 \u2212 f ) 16(n + 1)2 m2 (1 \u2212 f )\nwhere we have defined the quantity\nC\u2261\n\nq(1 \u2212 f )2 + p\u0303(1 \u2212 f ) + w\u0303\n,\n4(n + 1)2 [2m + (n + 2)(n + 3)(1 \u2212 f )]2\n\n(20)\n\nwith\n\nz(n + 2)2 (n + 3)2\nz(n + 2)(n + 3)\n,\nw\u0303 = w \u2212\n.\n(21)\n2\n4m\nm\nIn this form, Eq. (19) has poles at f = 0 and f = 1 (or, at r = rH and r = \u221e,\nrespectively) while the quantity C takes on a constant value in both limits.\np\u0303 = p \u2212\n\nWe then follow a similar method as before, and bring again Eq. (19) to the form of\na hypergeometric equation, with the indices (a, b, c) given by Eqs. (12), and the powers\n(\u03b1, \u03b2) by Eqs. (13)-(14). The only difference arises in the value of the arbitrary constant\nG that, in the case of scalar perturbations, takes the value\ns\n1\nq + p\u0303 + w\u0303\nG(S) =\n.\n(22)\n(n + 2)2 \u2212\n2(n + 1)\n[2m + (n + 2)(n + 3)]2\nBy applying the same boundary condition of no-outgoing waves near the horizon,\nthe general solution for scalar perturbations in the near-horizon regime is given again by\nEq. (18), with \u03b2 = \u03b2\u2212 and \u03b1 = \u03b1\u2212 , as before.\n\n3.2\n\nThe Far-Field Regime\n\nWe now turn to the far-field regime. In the limit r \u226b rH , f \u2192 1, and the field equation for\nall types of gravitational perturbations \u2013 tensor, vector and scalar \u2013 takes the simplified\nform\n\u0013\n\u0012\nd2 \u03a6\n(n + 1)2 A\n2\n\u03a6 = 0,\n(23)\n+ \u03c9 \u2212\ndr 2\nr2\n\u221a\nwhere A was defined in Eq. (10). By further setting \u03a6 = r R, the new radial function\nR is found to satisfy a Bessel differential equation\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bd2\nd2 R 1 dR\n+\n+ 1\u2212 2 R = 0,\n(24)\ndz 2\nz dz\nz\n5\n\n\fwith z = \u03c9r and \u03bd = l + (n + 1)/2. Therefore, the general solution of Eq. (23), standing\nfor the analytical solution in the far-field regime, can be written as\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(25)\n\u03a6F F (r) = B1 r Jl+(n+1)/2 (\u03c9r) + B2 r Yl+(n+1)/2 (\u03c9r) ,\nwhere J\u03bd and Y\u03bd are the Bessel functions of the first and second kind, respectively, and\nB1,2 arbitrary integration constants.\n\n3.3\n\nConstructing the complete solution\n\nHaving derived the two asymptotic analytical solutions near the black-hole horizon and\ninfinity, we may now proceed to construct a solution valid at the whole radial regime by\nsmoothly connecting the two solutions at an intermediate point. To this end, we need to\nstretch the near-horizon solution (18) towards large values of r, and the far-field solution\n(25) towards small values of r.\nBefore, however, being able to do the former, we need to rewrite the near-horizon\nsolution in an alternative form where the argument of the hypergeometric function has\nbeen shifted from f to 1 \u2212 f . To this end, we use the standard formula [16]\nF (a, b, c; f ) =\n\n\u0393(c) \u0393(c \u2212 a \u2212 b)\nF (a, b, a + b \u2212 c + 1; 1 \u2212 f )\n\u0393(c \u2212 a) \u0393(c \u2212 b)\n\n+ (1 \u2212 f )c\u2212a\u2212b\n\n(26)\n\n\u0393(c) \u0393(a + b \u2212 c)\nF (c \u2212 a, c \u2212 b, c \u2212 a \u2212 b + 1; 1 \u2212 f )\n\u0393(a) \u0393(b)\n\nin Eq. (18), and subsequently take the limit r \u226b rH , or f \u2192 1. We then find\n\u0010 r \u0011\u22121\u2212\u03b2 (n+1) \u0393(c) \u0393(a + b \u2212 c)\n\u0010 r \u0011\u03b2 (n+1) \u0393(c) \u0393(c \u2212 a \u2212 b)\nH\nH\n+ A1\n.\n\u03a6N H (r) \u2243 A1\nr\n\u0393(c \u2212 a) \u0393(c \u2212 b)\nr\n\u0393(a) \u0393(b)\n(27)\nWe now turn to the FF solution, which we expand in the opposite limit of r \u2192 0.\nBy using standard formulae for the Bessel functions [16], we then obtain\n\u0001\n\u0012 \u0013l+ n+1\nn\n\u0010 \u03c9 \u0011l+ n+1\n2\n\u0393 l + n+1\nr l+ 2 +1\nB2 2\n2\n2\n\u0001\u2212\n\u03a6F F (r) \u2243 B1\n.\n(28)\nl+ n\n2\n2\n\u03c0\n\u03c9\n\u0393 l + n+3\nr\n2\nAlthough we have brought both asymptotic solutions in a power-like form, the powers\nare not the same. One way to simplify the matching procedure is to take the low-energy\nlimit \u03c9rH \u226a 1 in the expression of \u03b2, Eq. (14). At first-order approximation, the \u03c9rH term may be ignored, in which case the powers in Eqs. (27) and (28) become identical. A\nsmooth matching is then achieved, and a complete solution is constructed, if the following\nrelations between the near-horizon and far-field integration constants hold\n\u0001\n\u0013l+ n+1\n\u0012\n2\n\u0393 l + n+3\n\u0393(c) \u0393(c \u2212 a \u2212 b)\nB1\n2\n2\n=\n,\n(29)\n\u221a\nA1\n\u03c9rH\n\u0393(c \u2212 a) \u0393(c \u2212 b) rH\n\u0010 \u03c9r \u0011l+ n+1\n\u0393(c) \u0393(a + b \u2212 c)\nB2\n2\nH\n\u0001\n= \u2212\u03c0\n\u221a .\nA1\n2\n\u0393 l + n+1\n\u0393(a) \u0393(b) rH\n2\n6\n\n(30)\n\n\fThe above completes the derivation, in an analytical way, of the solution for all types\nof gravitational perturbations in a (4 + n)-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole background in the low-energy regime. We now proceed to the calculation of the corresponding\nabsorption coefficient.\n\n4\n\nThe Absorption Coefficient\n\nThe far-field solution (25) can also be expanded in the limit r \u2192 \u221e, where the effective\npotential for all types of gravitational perturbations again vanishes due to the asymptotically flat behaviour of the metric. In this asymptotic regime, we therefore expect the\ngeneral solution to be described again by incoming and outgoing plane waves. Indeed, in\nthe limit r \u2192 \u221e, we obtain\no\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n1 n\n\u03a6F F (r) \u2243 \u221a\n(B1 \u2212 iB2 ) ei(\u03c9r\u2212 2 \u03bd\u2212 4 ) + (B1 + iB2 ) e\u2212i(\u03c9r\u2212 2 \u03bd\u2212 4 ) + ... ,\n(31)\n2\u03c0\u03c9\nwhere as before \u03bd = l + (n + 1)/2. From the above expression, we can easily define the\nreflection coefficient Rl as the ratio of the amplitude of the outgoing wave over the one\nof the incoming wave. Then, the absorption probability follows from the relation\n|Al |2 = 1 \u2212 |Rl |2 = 1 \u2212\n\nB\u2212i\nB+i\n\n2\n\n,\n\nwhere B is defined as\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u00132l+n+1\n\u0012\n\u0393 l + n+3\n\u0393 l + n+1\n\u0393(a) \u0393(b) \u0393(c \u2212 a \u2212 b)\n2\nB1\n2\n2\n=\u2212\n.\nB\u2261\nB2\n\u03c9rH\n\u03c0 \u0393(c \u2212 a) \u0393(c \u2212 b) \u0393(a + b \u2212 c)\n\n(32)\n\n(33)\n\nThe above two equations comprise our main analytical result for the absorption coefficient associated with the propagation of gravitons in the higher-dimensional black\nhole background given in Eq. (1). Individual solutions for scalar, vector and tensor type\nof perturbations may easily follow upon substituting the corresponding values for the\nhypergeometric indices (a, b, c) found in the previous section.\n\n4.1\n\nSimplified analytical result\n\nThe expression (33) can be simplified, and a compact analytical result for the absorption\ncoefficient may thus be derived, if we further expand it in the low-energy limit \u03c9rH \u226a 1.\nFor convenience, we re-write the hypergeometric indices as\na = \u03b1 + \u03b2 + G1 ,\nwhere\nG1 \u2261\n\nb = \u03b1 + \u03b2 + G2 ,\n\nn+2\n+G,\n2(n + 1)\n\nG2 \u2261\n\n7\n\nc = 1 + 2\u03b1 ,\n\nn+2\n\u2212 G.\n2(n + 1)\n\n(34)\n\n(35)\n\n\fAs G takes a different value for scalar, vector and tensor type of gravitational perturbations, G1,2 will also depend on the type of perturbation studied. We also write Eq. (32)\nin the form\n2i(B \u2217 \u2212 B)\n,\n(36)\n|Al |2 =\nBB \u2217 + i(B \u2217 \u2212 B) + 1\n\nand note that, in the low-energy limit, BB \u2217 \u226b i(B \u2217 \u2212 B) \u226b 1. Therefore, by keeping\nonly the dominant term in the denominator, we arrive at\n|Al |2 = K(\u03c9rH , \u03b2) [Z(\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2212 Z \u2217 (\u03b1, \u03b2)] ,\n\n(37)\n\nwhere\n\u0010 \u03c9r \u00112l+n+1 2i\u03c0 l + n+1 \u0001 \u0393(\u22121 + 2\u03b2 + G + G )\nH\n1\n2\n2\nK(\u03c9rH , \u03b2) \u2261 \u2212\n\u0001\nn+3 2\n2\n\u0393(1\n\u2212\n2\u03b2\n\u2212\nG\n\u2212\nG\n1\n2)\n\u0393 l+\n\n(38)\n\n2\n\nand\n\nZ(\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2261\n\n\u0393(1 + \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 G1 ) \u0393(1 + \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 G2 )\n.\n\u0393(\u03b1 + \u03b2 + G1 ) \u0393(\u03b1 + \u03b2 + G2 )\n\n(39)\n\nLet us focus first on the expression for K(\u03c9rH , \u03b2). By using the following identity\nsatisfied by the Gamma functions [16]\n\u0393(x) \u0393(1 \u2212 x) = \u2212x \u0393(\u2212x) \u0393(x) =\n\n\u03c0\n,\nsin(\u03c0x)\n\n(40)\n\nkeeping the dominant term \u03b2 (0) in the expansion of \u03b2 (Eq. 14) in the limit \u03c9rH \u226a 1, i.e.\n\u03b2 (0) \u2261 \u2212\n\n(2l + n + 2)\n,\n2(n + 1)\n\n(41)\n\nand using (35), we find\nK(\u03c9rH , \u03b2) =\n\n\u0010 \u03c9r \u00112l+n+1\nH\n\n2\n\n\u0393 l+\n\n\u0001\nn+3 2\n2\n\ni\u03c0 2 (n + 1)\n.\n\u0001\n2l 2\nsin [\u03c0(2\u03b2 (0) + G1 + G2 )]\n\u0393 1 + n+1\n\n(42)\n\nThe only complex quantity appearing in the expression of Z(\u03b1, \u03b2) is \u03b1, which is\npurely imaginary, therefore Z \u2217 (\u03b1, \u03b2) = Z(\u2212\u03b1, \u03b2). By using again Eq.

In the case of tensor perturbations, it can be shown that the above result reduces\nto the one for the absorption probability for a scalar field propagating in the bulk [7].\nThis result should have been anticipated by looking at the equation satisfied by the\ntensor-like\u221agravitational perturbations in the bulk: starting from Eq. (4) and setting\n\u03a6(T ) (r) = r n+2 \u03a6(r), the new radial function \u03a6(r) is found to satisfy the equation\n\u0014\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0015\nf (r)\nf (r) d\nn+2 d\u03a6\n2\nf (r) r\n+ \u03c9 \u2212 2 l(l + n + 1) \u03a6(r) = 0 ,\n(46)\nr n+2 dr\ndr\nr\nthat describes indeed the propagation of a scalar field in the black-hole background of\nEq. (1) [7].\nFrom Eq. (45), one may see that the absorption probability depends on both the\nangular momentum number l and number of extra dimensions n, through the arguments\nof the Gamma functions as well as the power of \u03c9rH . As either l or n increases, the\nlatter increases too, which, for \u03c9rH \u226a 1, causes a suppression in the value of |Al |2 . As\nthe behaviour of the remaining factor is not equally clear, in Table 1 we display the\nexplicit value of |Al |2 for all three types of gravitational perturbations, as these follow\n9\n\n\f\u03c9rH\n0.001\n0.01\n0.1\n0.3\n0.5\n\n(T )\n\n|Al |2 (simplified expression)\n1.6997 \u00d7 10\u221228\n1.6997 \u00d7 10\u221220\n1.6697 \u00d7 10\u221212\n1.1152 \u00d7 10\u22128\n6.6396 \u00d7 10\u22127\n\n(T )\n\n|Al |2 (exact expression)\n1.6997 \u00d7 10\u221228\n1.6999 \u00d7 10\u221220\n1.7112 \u00d7 10\u221212\n1.1839 \u00d7 10\u22128\n7.8001 \u00d7 10\u22127\n\nTable 2: Deviation between the values of the absorption probability given by the simplified and complete analytical expression, for tensor gravitational perturbations, for n = 2,\nl = 2 and different values of \u03c9rH < 1.\nfrom the simplified expression (45), for the indicative values n = 2, 4, 6 and l = 2, 3, 4.\nFrom these entries, one may easily conclude that, as either l or n increases, the value of\nthe absorption probability for all types of gravitational perturbations in the asymptotic\nlow-energy regime is significantly suppressed.\nAs a final comment, let us note here that, for the same values of l and n, |Al |2 assumes\na different value for different types of gravitational perturbations. From the entries of\nTable 1, we may easily see that the tensor perturbations are by orders of magnitude\nsuppressed compared to the vector and scalar perturbations, while the relative magnitude\nof the latter two is strongly dependent on the particular values of l and n. As the tensor\nperturbations have the same absorption probability as the bulk scalar fields, it would be\ninteresting to see whether gravitons dominate over scalar fields during the emission of\nHawking radiation in the bulk.\n\n4.2\n\nComplete analytical result\n\nIn deriving our main result for the absorption probability for gravitational perturbations\nin the bulk, Eqs. (32)-(33), the use of the low-energy assumption was made only once\n\u2013 during the matching of the two asymptotic solutions in the intermediate zone. Nevertheless, that was enough to restrict the validity of our solution to values of the \u03c9rH\nparameter well below unity. The simplified analytical result (45) was, on the other hand,\nthe result of a series of expansions in the arguments of the Gamma functions appearing\nin Eq. (33), and, as a result, its validity is significantly more restricted. In Table 2, we\ndisplay the values of the absorption coefficient derived by using our two analytical expressions, Eqs. (32)-(33) and (45), as \u03c9rH ranges from 0.001 to 0.5. We may easily see\nthat, for very low values of \u03c9rH , the agreement between the two values is remarkable;\nhowever, as soon as \u03c9rH reaches the value 0.5, the deviation between the two values\nappearing in the last row of Table 2 reaches the magnitude of 15%.\nIn this section, we return to our main analytical result for the absorption probability\nof gravitons in the bulk, Eqs. (32)-(33). As it was shown in the case of emission on the\nbrane [4, 9], the analytical, non-simplified, expression for |Al |2 is in excellent agreement\nwith the exact numerical result in the low-energy regime and in a good \u2013 both quantita10\n\n\f\u00c8A \u00c8 2\n\n\u00c8A \u00c8 2\n\n(n=6)\n\n1*10-13\n\n1*10-6\n\n8*10-14\n\n8*10-7\n\n6*10-14\n\n6*10-7\n\n(l=2)\n\nn=0\n4*10-14\n\nl=2\n\nn=2\nn=4\n\n4*10-7\n\nl=3\n\nn=6\nl=4\n\n2*10-14\n\n2*10-7\n\nl=5\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n\u03a9 rH\n\n1\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n\u03a9 rH\n\n1\n\nFigure 1: Absorption probability |Al |2 for tensor (solid lines), vector (short-dashed lines)\nand scalar (long-dashed lines) gravitational perturbations in the bulk for: (a) n = 6, and\nl = 2, 3, 4, 5, and (b) l = 2, and n = 0, 2, 4, 6.\n\ntive and qualitative \u2013 agreement in the intermediate-energy regime. In the high-energy\nregime, the validity of our expression naturally breaks down. There, we expect the greybody factor (absorption cross-section) to be given in terms of the absorptive area of the\nblack hole: this result has been computed in [9, 4], and holds for all types of perturbations\nindependently of their spin.\nIn Figs. 1(a) and (b), we depict the absorption probability for all types of gravitational perturbations, as a function of the dimensionless energy parameter \u03c9rH , and for\ndifferent values of the angular momentum number l and number of extra dimensions\nn, respectively. As expected, for all types of perturbations and values of l and n, the\nabsorption coefficient vanishes when the energy of the propagating particle goes to zero,\nwhile it increases with \u03c9rH . This is in agreement with the classical scattering theory:\nthe larger its energy, the more likely it is for a particle to overcome the gravitational\nfield of the black hole and escape to infinity. Figure 1(a) reveals that, as l increases,\nthe absorption probability for all types of gravitational perturbations is suppressed, in\naccordance with the behaviour noticed in the entries of Table 1; although the results\ndepicted correspond to the case n = 6, this behaviour was found to hold for all values\nof n. For fixed l, on the other hand, as we may see from Fig. 1(b), |Al |2 is found to\nexhibit a significant suppression also with n, for all types of gravitational perturbations,\nin agreement again with the behaviour noticed in the entries of Table 1. This behaviour\nis observed for the lowest two partial modes with l = 2 and l = 3; for higher values of\nl, |Al |2 shows a temporary enhancement, as n increases from 0 to 2, that nevertheless\nchanges again to a rapid suppression as n increases further.\nAs it was noticed by studying the asymptotic low-energy regime, the absorption\nprobability for tensor gravitational perturbations is significantly suppressed, compared\nto the other two types, also in the extended low- and intermediate-energy regime. On\nthe other hand, the vector and scalar perturbations may dominate one over the other\nfor different values of l: as it can be seen from our figures, the vector-like gravitational\nperturbations predominantly dominate for low values of l, while the scalar-like perturba11\n\n\f(T )\n\n(V )\n\nNl\n\n(S)\n\nNl\nn=1\n\nn=6\n\nNl\n\nn=1\n\nn=6\n\nn=1\n\nn=6\n\nl=2\n\n10\n\n495\n\n16\n\n231\n\n9\n\n44\n\nl=3\n\n24\n\n2574\n\n30\n\n910\n\n16\n\n156\n\nl=4\n\n42\n\n8748\n\n48\n\n2772\n\n25\n\n450\n\nl=5\n\n64\n\n23868\n\n70\n\n7140\n\n36\n\n1122\n\nTable 3: Multiplicities of states corresponding to the same angular momentum number l\nfor tensor, vector and scalar perturbations, for n = 1 and n = 6.\ntions usually take over for large values of l. As the higher partial waves are significantly\nsuppressed, we are led to conclude that the vector-type perturbations will be the dominant gravitational degree of freedom to be emitted in the bulk by a Schwarzschild-like\nhigher-dimensional black hole. However, different types of perturbations are characterized by a different multiplicity of states for the same value of l, and the latter must be\ntaken into account before such conclusions can be safely drawn.\n\n5\n\nEnergy Emission Rate\n\nWe finally turn to the energy emission rate by the higher-dimensional Schwarzschild\nblack hole for gravitons in the bulk. Let us first address the issue of the multiplicities\nof states that correspond to the same angular momentum number l. For tensor, vector,\nand scalar type of perturbations these are given by the expressions [17]\n(T )\n\nNl\n\n=\n\nn(n + 3)(l + n + 2)(l \u2212 1)(2l + n + 1)(l + n \u2212 1)!\n,\n2(l + 1)! (n + 1)!\n\n(47)\n\nl(l + n + 1)(2l + n + 1)(l + n \u2212 1)!\n,\n(l + 1)! n!\n\n(48)\n\n(V )\n\nNl\n\n=\n\n(2l + n + 1)(l + n)!\n,\n(49)\nl! (n + 1)!\nrespectively. As it is evident, the multiplicities depend also on the dimensionality of\nspacetime. In Table 3, we display the multiplicities of states for tensor, vector and scalar\nperturbations, for some indicative values of l and n. We immediately observe the proliferation of states as either one of these two parameters increases, especially the one with\nthe number of extra dimensions. It thus becomes clear that the value of the absorption\nprobability alone will not be the only decisive factor that will determine the contribution\nof each type of gravitational perturbation to the total emission rate of the black hole.\n(S)\n\nNl\n\n=\n\nWith the multiplicities of states and values of the absorption probability for each\ntype of perturbation at our disposal, we can now calculate the corresponding energy\n12\n\n\fd 2E\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080 @rH-1 D\ndtd\u03a9\n\nd 2E\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080 @rH-1 D\ndtd\u03a9\n\n(n=1)\n\n2*10-5\n\n2*10-8\n\n1.5*10-5\n\n1.5*10-8\n\n1*10-5\n\n1*10-8\n\n5*10-6\n\n5*10-9\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n\u03a9 rH\n\n1\n\n(n=6)\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n\u03a9 rH\n\n1\n\nFigure 2: Energy emission rates for tensor (thin solid lines), vector (short-dashed lines)\nand scalar (long-dashed lines) gravitational perturbations, and scalar fields (thick solid\nlines) in the bulk, for (a) n = 1, and (b) n = 6.\n\nemission rate at the low-energy regime. The contribution of each type of gravitational\nperturbation to the total graviton energy emission rate is given by the expression[4]\nd2 E (P )\n1 X (P ) (P ) 2\n\u03c9\nNl |Al |\n=\n,\ndt d\u03c9\n2\u03c0 l\nexp(\u03c9/TH ) \u2212 1\n\n(50)\n\nwhere the superscript P = (T, V, S) denotes the type of perturbation, and the black hole\ntemperature is given in Eq. (3). Summing over the three contributions, we may obtain\nthe total amount of energy emitted per unit time and unit frequency by the black hole in\nthe form of gravitons in the bulk. As this result would be more useful in the context of\nan exact numerical analysis (to which we hope to return soon), here we will concentrate\non the relative emission rates for the different types of gravitational perturbations and\ntheir relative magnitude to the one for bulk scalar fields.\nA simple numerical analysis, by combining Eq. (50) with the entries of Tables 1 and\n3, reveals that, in the asymptotic low-energy regime, the vector-like perturbations are\nindeed the dominant type of gravitational degree of freedom emitted in the bulk by the\nblack hole. For example, for n = 2 and l = 2, vector perturbations amount to 85%\nof the total gravitational degrees of freedom emitted, compared to 13% for scalar and\n2% for tensor degrees. As n increases further, so does the dominance of the vector-like\nperturbations that, for n = 6 and l = 2, reaches the magnitude of 97%. This dominance\nis never over-turned but it may be significantly decreased, at the level of higher partial\nwaves: for instance, for n = 6 and l = 4, the vector, scalar and tensor perturbations\ncorrespond to 74%, 12% and 14%, respectively, of the total number of gravitational\ndegrees of freedom emitted. In fact, due to their large multiplicity of states, the tensor\nperturbations dominate over the scalar ones, for most large values of n and/or l.\nThe above results valid at the lowest part of the radiation spectrum may change\nfor higher values of the energy parameter. Therefore, in Figs. 2(a) and (b), we plot the\nenergy emission rates for different types of gravitational perturbations, for n = 1 and\nn = 6, respectively, as these follow by using our complete analytical expression (32)-(33)\n13\n\n\ffor the absorption probability. For comparison, we also display the energy emission rate\nfor scalar fields in the bulk. In the sum over l in Eq. (50) we have included all modes up\nto l = 12, although at the very low-energy part of the spectrum, the contribution of all\nmodes with l \u2265 4 is at least four orders of magnitude smaller than the one of the l = 2\nfor every value of n. Having included a large enough number of modes in the sum, allows\nfor deviations from this behaviour as the energy increases.\nThe results depicted in Fig. 2 are in fact in excellent agreement with the conclusions\nderived by using the simplified expression for |Al |2 . The vector-type perturbations are\nindeed the dominant gravitational degrees of freedom to be emitted by the black hole\nin the bulk for every value of n. What depends on the number of extra dimensions is\nthe relative magnitude of the energy emission rate of scalar and tensor perturbations:\nwhereas for low n, the tensor perturbations are subdominant to the scalar ones over\nthe entire low-energy regime, for high n, they clearly dominate over the latter ones.\nDespite the above, the energy emission rates for all types of gravitational perturbations\nin the bulk, even when combined, remain well below the one for scalar fields in the lowenergy regime. This is due to the fact that the emission rate for scalar fields receives\na significant enhancement, in this particular energy regime, from the dominant l = 0\nand l = 1 modes, that are absent from the spectrum of gravitational perturbations. As\nthe energy parameter increases though, we expect the higher partial waves to gradually\ncome into dominance and possibly help gravitons to dominate over the bulk scalar fields.\nBy comparing finally the vertical axes of the two plots in Fig. 2, we conclude that\nthe low-energy emission rate for all types of degrees of freedom in the bulk decreases\nas the number of extra dimensions increases. Although both the temperature of the\nblack hole and multiplicity of states undergo a significant enhancement as n increases,\nthe equally significant suppression of the absorption probability, depicted in Fig. 1(b),\nprevails, leading to the suppression of the number of degrees of freedom emitted by\nthe black hole. This low-energy suppression for bulk scalar fields was first seen in [7, 9]\nbut the exact numerical analysis performed in the latter work showed that, for higher\nvalues of the energy parameter, the spectrum is enhanced with the number of extra\ndimensions. This is caused by the milder suppression of the absorption probability with\nn at higher frequencies, but also by the shift of the emission curve towards higher energies,\nin accordance with Wien's law \u2013 the latter leads to the emission of more higher frequency\nparticles and less low-energy ones as n increases [9]. Due to the similarities observed in the\nbehaviour of gravitational and scalar fields in the bulk, we expect the same enhancement\nto take place also for gravitons at higher energy regimes.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nA higher-dimensional black hole created in the context of a brane-world theory will\ndecay through the emission of Hawking radiation both in the bulk and on the brane.\nThe type of particles emitted along each \"channel\" are determined by the assumptions\nof the particular model, with only gravitons and possibly scalars propagating in the bulk\nwithin the framework of the Large Extra Dimensions scenario. Although the emission of\nscalars has been studied in detail, until recently gravitons have received little attention.\n14\n\n\fIn this work, we have addressed this gap in the literature by investigating the emission\nof tensor, vector and scalar gravitational modes in the bulk from a (4 + n)-dimensional\nSchwarzschild black hole. Working in the low energy regime, we analytically solved the\ncorresponding field equations and computed the absorption probability in each case. Both\na complete analytic expression and its asymptotic low-energy simplification were studied\nin detail, and their dependence on the angular momentum number l and number of extra\ndimensions n was examined. Although numerically different as the energy increases, these\ntwo expressions have identical qualitative behaviours, that reveal an increase in the value\nof the absorption probability with increasing energy and suppression as the number of\npartial wave l and extra dimensions n increase.\nThe complete analytical expression for the absorption probability was then used to\nderive the contribution of each gravitational degree of freedom to the total graviton\nemission rate of the black hole in the bulk. Accounting for the rapid proliferation of\nstate multiplicities with l or n, a sum over the first twelve partial waves was performed\nto obtain the total low-energy emission rate for each gravitational degree of freedom. Our\nresults show that vector perturbations are the dominant mode emitted in the bulk for\nall values of n. The relative emission rates of the subdominant scalar and tensor modes\ndepend on n, with scalars foremost at small n and tensors more prevalent at high n.\nThe absence of the l = 0, 1 partial waves, dominant in the low-energy regime, from all\ngravitational spectra causes even the total gravitational emission rate to be subdominant\nto that of scalar fields in the bulk. Finally, as previously found for bulk scalar fields, the\nenergy emission rates for all types of gravitational perturbations are suppressed with the\nnumber of extra dimensions in the entire low-energy regime.\nIn this work we have focused on the low-energy part of the Hawking radiation spectrum as it permitted analytical calculation and derivation of closed form expressions for\nthe absorption probability for gravitons. Although the radiation emitted in the bulk is\nnot directly observable, it determines the energy left for emission on our brane. In this\ncontext, our results, in addition to their theoretical interest, would be of particular use\nto experiments developed to detect the low-energy spectrum of radiation emitted from\na higher-dimensional black hole. As the exact form of the complete gravitational spectrum is still pending, we hope to return in the near future with results from a numerical\nanalysis that could only provide the answer to this question.\nNote added in proof. While this work was at its last stages, two relevant papers\nappeared in the literature, [18] and [19]. In particular, the latter work [19], that studies the\ngraviton emission rate in the bulk, overlaps with ours with respect to the analytical results\nfor the cases of tensor and vector gravitational perturbations, which are in agreement\nwith ours.\nAcknowledgments.
