In the\nabsence of damping, i.e. when \u03b3 = 0, this equation has the same stationary Bloch- and N\u00e9elwall solutions as the (2:1)-resonantly forced Ginzburg-Landau equation and the relativistic\nMontonen-Sarker-Trullinger-Bishop model [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, unlike the Ginzburg-Landau\nand the relativistic model, where only one of these solutions (the Bloch wall) is linearly stable\nin their region of coexistence, the NLS equation exhibits Bloch-N\u00e9el bistability. Furthermore, both domain-wall solutions of the NLS (also known as dark solitons or kinks) can\nmove with constant velocity, and the moving walls also turn out to be linearly stable [5].\nThis multistability is a rare phenomenon and leads one to wonder about the outcome of\nthe soliton-soliton interaction. The problem that is of ultimate interest to a physicist, is\nformulated as follows: Given an initial configuration of many different walls, will the asymptotic solution, as t \u2192 \u221e, consist of predominantly Bloch walls, N\u00e9el walls or possibly some\nother, more complicated, structures? Will the walls form widely spaced, equidistant lattices, or tightly bound clusters? In this paper we make the first step towards answering\nthese questions.\nWhen \u03b3 6= 0, equation (1) still has a dark soliton solution (in the form of the N\u00e9el\nwall); this solution was shown to be stable for all \u03b3 [5]. Our analysis of soliton interactions\nwill naturally include the case of nonzero damping, especially in view of the wide range of\napplications of Eq.(1).\nEquation (1) was indeed derived in a broad variety of physical situations. In fluid dynamics, the repulsive (\"defocusing\") parametrically driven NLS describes the amplitude of\nthe water surface in a vibrated channel with large width-to-depth ratio [6, 7, 8]. (The case\nof the small width-to-depth ratio gives rise to the attractive NLS [6, 7, 8].) The same equation arises as an amplitude equation for the upper cutoff mode in a chain of parametrically\ndriven, damped nonlinear oscillators. In the optical context, it was derived for the doubly\nresonant \u03c7(2) optical parametric oscillator in the limit of large second-harmonic detuning\n[10]. Next, stationary solutions of Eq.(1) with \u03b3 = 0 minimise the Ginzburg-Landau free\n3\n\n\fenergy of the anisotropic XY -model. Here F =\n\nR\n\nF dX, where\n\nF = 21 (\u2202X M)2 \u2212 (1 + h)M2 + 12 M4 + 2hMy2 + F0 ,\nand M(X) = (0, My , Mz ) is the magnetisation vector whose nontrivial components serve as\nthe real and imaginary parts of the complex field \u03a8(X) in (1): \u03a8 = My + iMz . This model\nappeared in studies of stationary domain walls in easy-axis ferromagnets near the Curie point\n[11]. Nonstationary magnetisation configurations were considered in the overdamped limit:\n\u03a8t = \u2212\u03b4F/\u03b4\u03a8\u2217 [12]. The damped hamiltonian dynamics \u03a8t = \u2212i\u03b4F/\u03b4\u03a8\u2217 \u2212 \u03b3\u03a8 provides a\nsensible alternative; this is precisely our equation (1).\nFinally we note that Eq.(1) also arises in a completely different magnetic context -\nthat of a weakly anisotropic easy-plane ferromagnet in a constant external magnetic field\n[5]. Here, the external field (chosen parallel to the z-axis) forces the magnetisation to be\nalmost homogeneous, and Eq.(1) describes small deviations \u01eb\u03a8 = Mx +iMy from the uniform\nmagnetisation M \u2248 (0, 0, 1). (Here \u01eb is a small parameter.) In the XY -model, on the other\nhand, Eq.(1) governs the magnetisation vector itself.\nThe literature devoted to the interactions of dark solitons and kinks is quite extensive\n(although perhaps not as vast as for bright solitons and pulses). Kinks are known to attract\nantikinks in real-valued, single-component Klein-Gordon equations, such as the sine-Gordon\nand \u03c64 -theory [13], with and without damping terms [14]. The same is true for kinks of\nthe real Ginzburg-Landau equations ut = uxx \u2212 V \u2032 (u) [14]. These results admit simple\ninterpretations; the kink-antikink pair converges in order to minimise its total energy in\nthe former case, and to minimise the value of its Lyapunov functional in the latter. Next,\nthe dark solitons of the (undriven) NLS equations are known to repel [15, 16]. This can\nalso be understood as an attempt to minimise the energy of the pair, at the expense of the\ngradient of the phase. Proceeding to the domain-wall solutions of the parametrically driven\nGinzburg-Landau equation\n2\n\u03a8 + \u03a8 \u2212 |\u03a8|2 \u03a8 \u2212 h\u03a8\u2217 ,\n\u2202t \u03a8 = 12 \u2202X\n\n(2)\n\nthe Bloch wall and antiwall of opposite chiralities were shown to attract, while those of like\nchiralities repel [17, 18]. (Here h < 13 , the region of stability of Bloch walls.) The N\u00e9el wall\nand antiwall always repel in their stability region (h > 31 ) [17]. Unlike the case without\ndriving, the interpretation of these interactions is not straight-forward though.\n4\n\n\fAs for the driven NLS equation, the behaviour of its Bloch and N\u00e9el walls is even less\npredictable at the intuitive level, while the variety of possible interacting partners is much\nwider due to the multistability. We will see that the interaction pattern is quite complicated\nindeed. The character of interaction (repulsion vs attraction) will depend both on the driving\nstrength and the interwall separation. We will also show that it is influenced by stationary\ncomplexes of walls, stable and unstable.\nThis paper constitutes the first part of our project; here, we restrict ourselves to interactions of the walls of the same type, i.e. N\u00e9el-N\u00e9el and Bloch-Bloch interactions. The\nanalysis of the nonsymmetric situations, i.e. N\u00e9el-Bloch interactions, requires a different\nmathematical formalism and will be presented separately. (See the following publication\n[19].)\nThe dynamics of the repelling solitons is, in a sense, trivial: if the walls are initially at\nrest, they will simply diverge to the infinities. Less obvious is what the collision of two\nattracting walls will result in. The study of the asymptotic (as t \u2192 \u221e) attractors arising\nin the parametrically driven NLS constitutes the second objective of our work. We will\nshow that if the dynamics are dissipative, then, depending on the strength of the driving,\ncolliding walls either annihilate or form a stable stationary bound state. In contrast to this,\nundamped collisions will be found to always produce a breather, a spatially localised, temporally oscillating structure. Depending on the initial conditions, the breather propagates\nor remains motionless, and in either case is found to persist indefinitely.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. The two fundamental solutions of Eq.(1), the\nBloch and N\u00e9el wall, are introduced in the next section. For the analysis of the Bloch-Bloch\nand N\u00e9el-N\u00e9el interaction we use the variational method, under the assumption of wellseparated walls. The method is detailed in section III and the resulting finite-dimensional\nsystems are analysed in sections IV, VII, and VIII. Section IV deals with the N\u00e9el walls;\nsection VII is devoted to the Bloch walls of the opposite chirality, while the like-chirality\nwalls are examined in section VIII. The conclusions of the variational analysis have been\nverified in direct numerical simulations of the full partial differential equation. The numerical\nsimulations allow to advance beyond the limit of well-separated walls; in particular, we use\nthis approach to examine the outcome of soliton collisions. We have allocated a separate\nsection (section VI) to the N\u00e9el-N\u00e9el simulations while the Bloch-Bloch simulations are\nreported in sections VII and VIII, along with the corresponding variational results. The\n5\n\n\fnontrivial attractors mentioned above - the stationary bound state in the case of dissipative\ndynamics, and the breather in the undamped system - are further investigated in sections\nV and IX, respectively. Finally, the main results of this work are summarised in section X.\n\nII.\n\nDARK SOLITONS: PRELIMINARIES\n\nDark solitons are localised patches of low intensity (|\u03a8|2 \u226a 1) in a high intensity back-\n\nground (|\u03a8|2 = O(1)). The admissible backgrounds are described by the stationary, spatially\nhomogeneous nonzero solutions of Eq.(1),\n\u03a8\n\n(\u00b1)\n\nflat\n\n= iA\u00b1 ei\u03b8\u00b1 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\np\n\nh2 \u2212 \u03b3 2 ,\n\u03b3\n2\u03b8\u2212 = \u03c0 \u2212 arcsin .\nh\n\nA\u00b1 =\n\u03b3\n2\u03b8+ = arcsin ,\nh\n\nq\n\n1\u00b1\n\n(4)\n\nAs one can easily check, for h \u2264 \u03b3 the zero solution is the only stable background and so\ndark solitons can only exist for h > \u03b3; this is the condition we are implicitly assuming in\n(\u2212)\n\n(+)\n\nis always\nis stable for all values of h > \u03b3 while \u03a8\nflat\nflat\nunstable. We will only consider dark solitons existing over the stable background so that all\nthis paper. It can be shown that \u03a8\n\nsolutions obey |\u03a8|2 \u2192 A2+ as |X| \u2192 \u221e. Accordingly, A stands for A+ and \u03b8 for \u03b8+ for the\nrest of the paper.\nIt will be convenient to transform Eq.(1) so that the asymptotic solution is independent\nof h and \u03b3. To this end, we set\n\u03a8(X, t) = iAei\u03b8 \u03c8(x, t),\n\nx = AX.\n\n(5)\n\n(We have also rescaled the spatial dependence for later convenience.) Under this transformation, Eq.(1) becomes\ni\u03c8t +\n\nA2\n\u03c8\n2 xx\n\n\u2212 A2 |\u03c8|2 \u03c8 + \u03c8 + (A2 \u2212 1)\u03c8 \u2217 + i\u03b3(\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8 \u2217 ) = 0.\n\n(6)\n\nThis is the form of the parametrically driven, damped NLS that we will be working with in\nthis paper. The stable background solutions of Eq.(6) are simply \u03c8flat = \u00b11.\n6\n\n\fSolutions to Eq.(6) with |\u03c8| \u2192 1 as |x| \u2192 \u221e can either be topological [\u03c8(\u2212\u221e) = \u2212\u03c8(\u221e)]\nor nontopological [\u03c8(\u2212\u221e) = \u03c8(\u221e)]. Eq.(6) has two explicit topological solitons. The first\nis the N\u00e9el, or Ising, wall [1, 2, 6, 11, 20]:\n\u03c8N (x) = tanh(x),\n\n(7)\n\nnamed after the N\u00e9el wall in magnetism, which is a domain wall with the magnitude of the\nmagnetisation vector vanishing at its centre. The second topological solution, which exists\nonly for \u03b3 = 0, is usually referred to as the Bloch wall [1, 2, 3, 4]:\n\u03c8B (x) = tanh(Bx) \u00b1 i\u03ba0 sech(Bx).\n\n(8)\n\n(In magnetism, a Bloch wall is a domain wall connecting the two domains smoothly, with\nthe magnetisation vector remaining nonzero everywhere.) In Eq.(8),\nr\n\u221a\n4h\n2 A2 \u2212 1\nB=\n=\nA\n1+h\nand\n\u03ba0 =\n\n\u221a\n\n4 \u2212 3A2\n=\nA\n\nr\n\n1 \u2212 3h\n.\n1+h\n\n(9)\n\nThe solutions obtained by multiplying \u03c8N and \u03c8B by (\u22121) will be called antiwalls, or\nantikinks.\nThe Bloch wall (8) exists in two chiralities. In the Bloch wall with positive imaginary\npart, the phase of the complex field \u03c8(x) decreases (that is, the point on the unit circle\nmoves clockwise) as x varies from \u2212\u221e to +\u221e. By analogy with the right-hand rule of\ncircular motion, we refer to this wall as the right-handed Bloch wall. The phase of the Bloch\nwall with negative imaginary part increases as x increases (that is, the phase vector rotates\ncounter-clockwise). This corresponds to a left-handed sense of rotation, so that this wall\nwill be called the left-handed Bloch wall. The antiwall obtained by multiplying \u03c8B by \u22121\nhas obviously the same chirality as its parent wall, \u03c8B . Regardless of their chirality, Bloch\nwalls only exist for h < 13 .\nIn Ref.[5], it was proved that the N\u00e9el wall is stable for all h > \u03b3. The stability of the\nBloch wall in its entire domain of existence was demonstrated numerically [5].\nExamples of nontopological dark solitons are given by stationary complexes, or bound\nstates, of domain walls. These can be formed by two dissipative N\u00e9el walls, or by a Bloch\n7\n\n\fand N\u00e9el wall - in the undamped situation. (See [5, 21].) In condensed matter physics,\nthese nontopological solitons describe bubbles of one thermodynamic phase in another one\n[22]. Accordingly, we will occassionally be referring to bound states of domain walls as\nsolitonic bubbles.\n\nIII.\n\nINTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE WALLS: THE METHOD\n\nIn this paper, we will be paying special attention to the simplest situation where the\ninteracting walls are initially at rest. Choosing the origin of the coordinate axis midway\nbetween two Bloch or two N\u00e9el walls, one can verify that the subsequent evolution will\npreserve this symmetric arrangement (see below). A symmetric pair of well separated walls\ncan be approximated by a product function\n\u03c8 = \u03c61 (x, t)\u03c62 (x, t),\n\n(10a)\n\nwhere \u03c61 and \u03c62 represent the individual walls in the pair:\n\u03c61 (x, t) = tanh [B(x + z)] \u2212 i\u03ba1 sech[B(x + z)],\n\n(10b)\n\n\u03c62 (x, t) = tanh [B(x \u2212 z)] + i\u03ba2 sech[B(x \u2212 z)].\n\n(10c)\n\nIn Eq.(10), \u03ba1 and \u03ba2 are time-dependent parameters accounting for the deformation of the\nwalls due to their interaction. The variable z = z(t) gives half the distance between the walls;\nwithout loss of generality, we take z to be positive. Finally, the constant B characterises the\nwidth of the walls (B = B for Bloch walls and B = 1 for N\u00e9el walls).\nOur analysis is based on the variational method. For this method, we substitute the\nAnsatz (10) into the action integral that gives rise to Eq.(6):\nZ\nS = Le2\u03b3t dt,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere\n\nL = Re\n\nZ \u001a\n\n\u0003 i\u03b3 \u0002 2\n\u0003 A2\nA2\nA2 \u2212 1 \u0002 2\nA2\n\u03c8 + (\u03c8 \u2217 )2 +\n\u03c8 \u2212 (\u03c8 \u2217 )2 \u2212\n|\u03c8x |2 \u2212\n|\u03c8|4 + |\u03c8|2 +\ni\u03c8t \u03c8 \u2212\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(12)\n\u2217\n\n8\n\n\u001b\n\ndx.\n\n\fIn what follows we introduce a small parameter \u01eb = e\u22122Bz .

In deriving (13b)(13c) we neglected all powers of \u01eb higher than \u01eb2 . One can readily check that such terms\nwould produce only higher-order corrections in the resulting equations of motion.\nSome comments must be made regarding the Ansatz (10). After a variational Ansatz\nhas been substituted in the corresponding field Lagrangian and the x-dependence integrated away, all dynamical variables (or possibly their combinations) can be grouped into\ncanonically-conjugate pairs. (See [23] for review and references.) In particular, if the waveform consists of two solitary waves and the separation between two constituents, 2z, is\nchosen as one of the variables, the conjugate momentum is the phase gradient. This fact is\nwell known in the case where the constituents are bell-shaped (\"bright\") solitons (see e.g.\n[24, 25]). That it remains true in a more general situation can be seen from an analogy\nwith quantum mechanics where the momentum of the system is given by an eigenvalue of\nthe operator 1i \u2202x . (Since the eigenvalue has to be real, the operator acts just on the phase\nof the eigenfunction while the modulus is taken to be constant.) Another simple analogy\n9\n\n\farises if we write \u03c8 =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03c1ei\u03c7 ; this polar decomposition casts Eq.(1) with h = \u03b3 = 0 in the\n\nform of equations of gas dynamics, where \u03c1 is the density of the gas and \u2202x \u03c7 is its velocity,\nproportional to the momentum.\nIn the case of bright solitons, each constituent soliton in the Ansatz is usually multiplied\nby eik(x\u00b1z) (see e.g. [24, 25]); then, the momentum conjugate to z is k. However, in the case\nof kinks this simple recipe would violate the boundary conditions at infinity. For this reason\nwe have introduced the phase gradient by allowing the imaginary parts \u03ba1,2 sech [B(x \u00b1 z)]\nof the kinks to be variable. The imaginary parts decay as |x| \u2192 \u221e and therefore making\nthem variable is compatible with the boundary conditions. Below, we will show that \u03ba1 and\n\u03ba2 are indeed momenta canonically conjugate to z.\nAnother reason for introducing the phase gradient in this way is a simple interpretation\nof the finite-dimensional momenta \u03ba1 and \u03ba2 in terms of the original fields \u03c8(x, t). Indeed,\nthese variables coincide, modulo a numerical coefficient, with the field momenta of the two\nwalls. The field momentum integral has the form\nZ\ni\n(\u03c8x\u2217 \u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8x \u03c8 \u2217 ) dx.\nP =\n2\n\n(14)\n\nFor the undamped NLS [equation (6) with \u03b3 = 0], the integral (14) is conserved. The field\nmomentum of the N\u00e9el wall (7) equals zero, while that of the Bloch wall (8) is given by\nPB = \u2213\u03c0\u03ba0 . [The same sign convention is used here as for Eq.(8) - the top sign applies\nfor the right-handed wall, while the bottom sign corresponds to the left-handed wall.] It\nis not difficult to check that the field momenta of the perturbed walls \u03c61 and \u03c62 in the\nconfiguration (10) are P [\u03c61 ] = \u03c0\u03ba1 and P [\u03c62 ] = \u2212\u03c0\u03ba2 .\nIn symmetric situations that we are concerned with, the variables \u03ba1 and \u03ba2 (both of\nwhich are conjugate to the same coordinate variable z) will eventually turn out to be related\ndue to the equations of motion. The calculations simplify, however, if this relationship is\nestablished yet at the level of the lagrangian (13), that is, before the equations of motion\nhave been derived.\nThe relationship between \u03ba1 and \u03ba2 depends on the type of walls being considered. If the\ninitial configuration consists of two well-separated N\u00e9el walls at rest, or two quiescent distant\nBloch walls of opposite chirality, we have a symmetry \u03c8(x, 0) = \u03c8(\u2212x, 0). Since equation\n(6) is parity-invariant, the subsequent evolution will preserve this symmetry. Substituting\nthe Ansatz (10) into \u03c8(x, t) = \u03c8(\u2212x, t), we get \u03ba1 = \u03ba2 . The initial value of \u03ba(t) should be\n10\n\n\fchosen close to zero for N\u00e9el walls and close to \u00b1\u03ba0 for Bloch walls [with the sign of \u03ba(0)\ndepending on whether the wall placed on the right is right- or left-handed.]\nIf the initial configuration consists of two quiescent Bloch walls of like chirality, the\nrelationship between \u03ba1 and \u03ba2 is not so trivial to establish. The reason is that equation (6)\ndoes not preserve the symmetry \u03c8 \u2217 (x, 0) = \u03c8(\u2212x, 0) of the initial condition. In this case we\nhave to appeal to the field-momentum considerations rather than symmetries. Substituting\nthe Ansatz (10) into the integral (14), we find that P [\u03c8] = \u03c0(\u03ba1 \u2212 \u03ba2 )[1 + O(e\u22122Bz )]. On the\nother hand, the total momentum of two like-chirality walls which are initially at rest and\nfar away from each other, should be near \u22132\u03c0\u03ba0 . Therefore, for moving walls the quantity\n\n\u03ba1 \u2212 \u03ba2 must not be different from \u22132\u03ba0 by more than O(e\u22122Bz ). This is accomplished by\nletting \u03ba1 = \u2213\u03ba0 + q(t) and \u03ba2 = \u00b1\u03ba0 + q(t). When z is large, the perturbation q(t) is small\n- but not necessarily as small as \u01eb.\nThe Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding to Eqs.(11),(13) are\n\u2202T\n\u2202V\nd \u2202T\n\u2202T\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212 2\u03b3\n= 0,\n\u2202\u03ba\n\u2202\u03ba\ndt \u2202 \u03ba\u0307\n\u2202 \u03ba\u0307\n\n(15a)\n\n\u2202V\nd \u2202T\n\u2202T\n\u2202T\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212 2\u03b3\n= 0.\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\ndt \u2202 \u017c\n\u2202 \u017c\n\n(15b)\n\nand\n\nIn Eq.(15a), we assumed the situation of \u03ba1 = \u03ba2 \u2261 \u03ba (that is, two N\u00e9el or two oppositelyhanded Bloch walls). In the other case, i.e. when we have two Bloch walls of like chirality,\n\u03ba should be replaced by q in Eq.(15a). The integrals T and V can both be found explicitly\nand simplified assuming wide separation of the walls.\nFinally, we note that the variational method is not well suited for the analysis of the\nBloch-N\u00e9el interaction. The reason for this is that the Bloch and N\u00e9el walls have different\nwidths, leading to terms in the Lagrangian which are not periodic along the imaginary axis\non the plane of complex x; as a result, the Lagrangian cannot be obtained in closed form.\n(When the walls have the same width, the integrals can all be evaluated by integration along\nthe rectangular contour with one side on the real axis and the other on the line Im x = \u03c0/B.)\nConsequently, we had to resort to a different approach for the analysis of the N\u00e9el-Bloch\ninteraction (see paper II of this project [19].) The resulting phenomenology is also very\ndifferent [19].\n\n11\n\n\fIV.\n\nTWO N\u00c9EL WALLS\n\nIn this case, we let B = 1 and \u03ba1 = \u03ba2 \u2261 \u03ba. In equations (15) we discard products of\npowers of small quantities \u01eb and \u03ba for which there are larger counterparts. For instance,\nwe drop a term proportional to \u01eb2 \u03ba from an equation which already has a term \u01eb\u03ba with\na nonsmall coefficient. Here we keep in mind that in some cases the damping \u03b3 and the\ndifference |A2 \u2212 43 | can be small parameters, hence we cannot drop \u01eb2 \u03ba in favour of the term\n\u03b3\u01eb\u03ba or (A2 \u2212 34 )\u01eb\u03ba. With these simplifications, equations (15a)-(15b) take the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\n4\n2\n\u03c0 \u01eb\u0307 = 12 A \u2212\n\u03ba\u01eb\n3\n16\n+32\u03c0\u03b3\u01eb2 \u03ba2 + A2 \u03ba3 \u01eb \u2212 64(A2 \u2212 1)\u03ba\u01eb2 ,\n3\n\u03c0(\u03ba\u0307 + 2\u03b3\u03ba) = 32A2 \u01eb2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n4\n\u03ba2 \u01ebz + 32(A2 \u2212 1)\u01eb\u03ba2 .\n\u221224 A2 \u2212\n3\n\n(16a)\n\n(16b)\n\nThe subsequent analysis depends on the relation between the damping and driving in the\nsystem.\n\nA.\n\n\u03b3 = O(1)\n\nFirst we consider the case where \u03b3 is not small. Assume, in addition, that A2 is not close\nto 43 . (Later in this subsection we will explore the situation where |A2 \u2212 34 | is small.) In this\ncase the terms in the second lines of (16a) and (16b) are smaller than those in the first lines\nand can be neglected. The equations simplify to\n\u0013\n\u0012\n4\n2\n\u03ba\u01eb,\n\u03c0 \u01eb\u0307 = 12 A \u2212\n3\n\u03c0(\u03ba\u0307 + 2\u03b3\u03ba) = 32A2 \u01eb2 .\n\n(17a)\n(17b)\n\nSince \u03ba is small, the variable \u01eb(t) varies very slowly, \u01eb\u0307/\u01eb \u223c \u03ba.

For\n\nA2 < 34 , two walls repel whereas for A2 > 34 , the walls attract - except for A2 close to 43 , in\nwhich case they form a stable bound state.\nWe should emphasise here that our present conclusions pertain only to distant walls. In\norder to extend our understanding of the N\u00e9el wall dynamics beyond the limit of very small\n\u01eb, one has to analyse the dynamical system (16) without neglecting any powers of \u01eb and \u03ba\nin it.

Noting that the\n\u03ba-axis (\u01eb = 0) is an invariant manifold flowing into the fixed point and calculating the index\nof the vector field (22) along the semicircle \u01eb2 + \u03ba2 = R2 , \u01eb \u2265 0, with R < 1, we conclude\n14\n\n\f0.01\n\n0.1\n\n(a)\n\nh = 0.8\n\u03b3=0\n\n0.005\n\n\u03ba\n\n0.05\n\n\u03ba\n\n0\n\n\u22120.005\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n\u22120.05\n\nh = 0.2\n\u03b3=0\n\n\u22120.01\n0\n\n0.001\n\n0.002\n\n\u03b5\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0.003\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\n\u03b5\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\nFIG. 2: Vector field (22) with \u03b3 = 0. (a) A2 < 34 ; (b) A2 > 43 .\n\nthat the fixed point is a stable node for A2 <\n\n4\n3\n\nand a saddle for A2 > 34 . Hence, for A2 < 34 ,\n\nall trajectories tend to the origin as t \u2192 \u221e [Fig.1(a)], i.e., the walls repel.\nFor A2 >\n\n4\n,\n3\n\nall trajectories fly away to infinity [Fig.1(b)] implying the attraction of\n\nthe walls. One may wonder whether some trajectories coming from the lower half of the\nphase plane, could flow into the origin (tangent to the vertical axis.) A simple analysis of\ntrajectories in a small neighbourhood of the origin shows that such behaviour is, in fact,\nimpossible. Trajectories which seem to be approaching the point \u01eb = \u03ba = 0 close to the\n\u03ba-axis, do turn away when they are a small distance away from the origin. This is illustrated\nby Fig.1(c) which gives a blow-up of a small neighbourhood of the fixed point.\nIn the next subsection, we will zoom in on a small neighbourhood of A2 =\n\n4\n3\n\nto draw a\n\nsharper boundary between domains of the opposite types of interaction - similar to the way\nwe have done it for large \u03b3. We should also mention here that, as in the previous subsection,\nour current conclusions pertain to walls with large separations.\nThe undamped case, \u03b3 = 0, is exceptional; in this case, the entire \u03ba-axis is a line of fixed\npoints - they represent pairs of infinitely separated walls moving at constant velocities.\nFor A2 < 34 , the points with \u03ba > 0 are stable and those with \u03ba < 0 unstable. Trajectories\nhave the form of arcs starting on the lower semiaxis and flowing into points on the upper\nsemiaxis: \u01eb(t) \u2192 0, \u03ba(t) \u2192 \u03ba\u2217 > 0 as t \u2192 \u221e [Fig.2(a)]. The separation between the walls\n\u0001\ncorresponding to the points on the upper semiaxis grows linearly: z \u2192 \u2212 \u03c06 A2 \u2212 43 \u03ba\u2217 t;\nthat is, the evolution produces two N\u00e9el walls moving away from each other at a constant\nspeed.\nIn the undamped case with A2 > 34 , the stable points are those with \u03ba < 0 and unstable\n15\n\n\fthose with \u03ba > 0. Since \u03ba\u0307 > 0 on the horizontal axis (where \u03ba = 0), trajectories starting\non the upper semiaxis cannot cross to the negative-\u03ba half-plane and have to escape to the\npositive-\u03ba infinity: \u03ba \u2192 \u221e, \u01eb \u2192 \u221e as t \u2192 +\u221e. The same is true for trajectories that\nhave arrived from the negative-\u03ba half-plane. Invoking the reversibility of the system (22)\nwith \u03b3 = 0, i.e. making use of the invariance under t \u2192 \u2212t, \u03ba \u2192 \u2212\u03ba, completes the phase\nportrait [Fig.2(b)].\nTo interpret the portrait, we note that \u03ba is proportional to \u017c, the velocity of the wall\n[see Eq.(22a)]. According to Fig.2(b), two walls with zero initial velocities [\u03ba(0) = 0] will\nattract [\u01eb(t) \u2192 \u221e as t \u2192 \u221e]. The same applies, naturally, to the walls whose initial\nvelocities are directed towards each other [\u03ba(0) > 0], and to walls with small outward initial\nvelocities [\u03ba(0) < 0]. However, walls with sufficiently large outward initial velocities will\n\u0001\ndiverge [\u01eb(t) \u2192 0], with the separation growing linearly: z(t) \u2192 \u2212 \u03c06 A2 \u2212 43 \u03ba\u2217 t as t \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(Here \u03ba\u2217 < 0.) The dashed line in Fig.2(b) is a separatrix between initial conditions giving\nrise to the above two scenarios.\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that when \u03b3 = 0, equations (15) with \u03ba1 = \u03ba2 = \u03ba and\nB = 1 form a hamiltonian system (with a nonstandard bracket):\n\u017c =\n\n1 \u2202H\n,\n\u03c0\u03c4 \u2202\u03ba\n\n\u03ba\u0307 = \u2212\n\n1 \u2202H\n,\n\u03c0\u03c4 \u2202z\n\n(23)\n\nwhere\n\u03c4 (\u01eb, \u03ba) = 1 + 2\u01eb(1 \u2212 14\u01eb + \u03ba2 + 10\u01eb\u03ba2 ) > 0,\n\n(24)\n\nand the Hamiltonian\n2\nH(\u01eb, \u03ba) = (1 \u2212 3h)\u03ba2 \u2212 A2 \u03ba4 + 4\u01eb\u03ba2 [(1 \u2212 3h)z + 4h]\n3\n8 2\n+ \u01eb [3A2 + (12 \u2212 25A2 )\u03ba2 + 14A2 \u03ba4 \u2212 4A2 \u03ba6 ]\n3\n+ 16\u01eb2 z\u03ba2 (5A2 \u2212 4 \u2212 A2 \u03ba2 ).\nThis observation endows \u03ba with a simple interpretation of the momentum canonically conjugate to z - in agreement with qualitative arguments in section III.\n\n16\n\n\fC.\n\nSmall |A2 \u2212 43 |; small \u03b3\n\nFinally, let us assume that both |A2 \u2212 34 | and \u03b3 are small. Here, equations (16) are to be\nreplaced by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n4\n64\n64\n2\n\u03c0 \u01eb\u0307 = 12 A \u2212\n\u03ba\u01eb + \u03ba3 \u01eb \u2212 \u03ba\u01eb2 ,\n3\n9\n3\n128 2 32 2\n\u03c0(\u03ba\u0307 + 2\u03b3\u03ba) =\n\u01eb + \u01eb\u03ba .\n3\n3\n\n(25a)\n(25b)\n\nNote that we have neglected the term proportional to z = \u2212 21 ln \u01eb in the second line of (16b).\nWhen A2 \u2212\n\n4\n3\n\n< 0, this is justifiable as this term is of the same sign as the last term in the\n\nright-hand side of (16b) and so it cannot alter the dynamics qulitatively. The validity of\nthis approximation for A2 \u2212\n\n4\n3\n\n> 0 will be established below.\n\nThe dynamics is influenced by nontrivial fixed points which arise as intersections of the\nnullclines of the system (25):\n\u0013\n\u0012\n64 2 64\n\u03ba\u01eb 12\u03bc + \u03ba \u2212 \u01eb = 0,\n9\n3\n128 2 32 2\n\u01eb + \u01eb\u03ba \u2212 2\u03c0\u03b3\u03ba = 0.\n3\n3\n\n(26a)\n(26b)\n\nHere we have introduced\n4\n\u03bc = A2 \u2212 .\n3\nThe nullcline (26b) emanates out of the origin as a parabola: \u03ba \u2192\nturns back and escapes to infinity asymptotic to the positive \u03ba-axis: \u03ba \u2192\n\n(27)\n64 2\n\u01eb as \u01eb \u2192\n3\u03c0\u03b3\n3\u03c0\u03b3 \u22121\n\u01eb as \u01eb \u2192\n16\n\n0;\n0.\n\nImportantly, it has no points in the \u01eb > 0, \u03ba < 0 quadrant. The nullcline (26a) consists\n(apart from the vertical and horizontal axes) of a parabola lying on a side: \u01eb = 43 \u03bc + 13 \u03ba2 .\nIntersections of these nullclines are easy to determine and visualise, and the stability of the\nfixed points can be classified by straightfoward index arguments.\nWhen \u03bc < 0, there is only one nullcline intersection in the positive-\u01eb halfplane. It is\nnot difficult to check that this fixed point is a saddle. The origin is also a fixed point -\na stable node. The portrait is in Fig.3(a). Distant walls [more precisely, walls with initial\nconditions lying below the stable manifold of the saddle in Fig.3(a)] repel: \u01eb(t) \u2192 0 as\nt \u2192 \u221e. On the other hand, nearby walls (more precisely, those above the stable manifold)\nattract: \u01eb(t) \u2192 \u221e.\nAs \u03bc grows through zero, another fixed point appears from the negative-\u01eb half-plane. An\nexchange of stabilities occurs at \u03bc = 0: the nontrivial point appearing for \u03bc > 0 is a stable\n17\n\n\fnode whereas the origin becomes a saddle. The nearby walls attract while distant walls form\na stable bound state [Fig.3(b)]. As \u03bc is increased further, the two nontrivial fixed points\nmerge in a saddle-node bifurcation. When \u03bc > \u03bcsn , the origin persists as the only fixed\npoint in the system (an unstable one). All walls attract [Fig.3(c)].\nNote that the logarithmic term in (16b) that was omitted in (25b), becomes of the same\norder as the last term in the right-hand side of (16b) only if z\u03bc \u223c 1, i.e. when \u01eb is as small as\n\ne\u22122/\u03bc . However, since the nullcline (26a) is bounded from the vertical axis by the inequality\n\u01eb\u2265\n\n9\n\u03bc,\n16\n\nthere can be no fixed points with \u01eb \u223c e\u22122/\u03bc . Therefore the logarithmic term can\n\nhave no significant effect on the dynamics and its omission is totally legitimate.\nTo find the threshold \u03bcsn (\u03b3), we eliminate \u03ba between (26a) and (26b). The resulting\nequation can be written as\n\n\u03bc\n7\u01eb \u2212 27\n3\u03c0\n16\n=\n\u03b3.\n\u01ebq\n16\n3\u01eb \u2212 27\n\u03bc\n16\n\n(28)\n\n9\n\u03bc\nIf \u03bc is positive, the function F (\u01eb) in the left-hand side of (28) grows to infinity as \u01eb \u2192 16\n\u221a\n1\n(31 + 457)\u03bc. The minimum value is\nand \u01eb \u2192 \u221e, and has a minimum at \u01eb = \u01ebmin = 126\n\nF (\u01ebmin ) = F0 \u03bc3/2 , where F0 is a numerical coefficient. Consequently, Eq.(28) has no roots if\n\u03bc > (3\u03c0/16F0)2/3 \u03b3 2/3 \u2248 0.3048\u03b3 2/3 and two roots if 0 < \u03bc < 0.3048\u03b3 2/3 .\nAccording to Eq.(28), when \u03b3 grows, the \"smaller\" (stable) fixed point tends to \u01eb =\n\n9\n\u03bc;\n16\n\nthis reproduces Eq.(21) of subsection IV A.\nThese considerations translate into the following criterion valid for small \u03b3 and small\ndifferences A2 \u2212 43 . [We are also assuming that the imaginary parts of the perturbation\nof the walls are small initially, i.e. \u03ba(0) is small.] The direction of forces between the\nwalls depends on their position relative to two stationary bound states, a stable (with\nthe interwall separation denoted 2zs ) and an unstable one (with the separation 2zu ). The\nunstable complex exists for all A2 < A2sn while the stable one only for\nA2sn =\n\n4\n+ 0.3048\u03b3 2/3 .\n3\n\n4\n3\n\n< A2 < A2sn , where\n(29)\n\nIn their region of coexistence ( 43 < A2 < A2sn ), the stable complex has a larger separation:\n2zs > 2zu . As A2 \u2192 34 , the distance 2zs grows to infinity.\n\nWhen A2 < 43 , two N\u00e9el walls repel if their separation distance is greater than 2zu . If\n\nthe initial separation is smaller than 2zu , the walls attract. It is natural to expect that\nthe attraction should result in the annihilation of the walls, but this diagnosis is beyond\n18\n\n\fthe scope of the variational approximation and can only be established in direct numerical\nsimulations of the full partial differential equation (6) (see below).\nNext, if\n\n4\n3\n\n< A2 < A2sn , the walls with separations larger than 2zu will move towards the\n\nstable equilibrium [from inside or outside depending on whether z(0) < zs or z(0) > zs ].\nThe walls at shorter distances, 2z(0) < 2zu , are attracted to each other; they converge and,\napparently, annihilate.\nFinally, for A2 > A2sn , the walls are attracted to each other. No complexes, stable or\nunstable, can be formed for these large A.\nLike in the large-|\u03bc| situation, the undamped case (\u03b3 = 0) is exceptional in the small-|\u03bc|\nregion. In this case, the whole \u03ba-axis is a line of fixed points. When \u03bc > 0, the phase\nportrait [Fig.4(b)] is similar to Fig.2(b). The walls which are initially at rest [\u03ba(0) = 0],\nattract (\u01eb \u2192 \u221e as t \u2192 \u221e). As for the moving walls with large separations, their initial\nvelocities are determined by \u03ba(0):\n\u0014\n\u0015\n32 2\n\u03ba(0)\n6\u03bc + \u03ba (0) .\n\u017c(0) \u2248 \u2212\n\u03c0\n9\n\n(30)\n\nIf the walls are initially diverging sufficiently fast, they will continue to do so, with\n\u0012\n\u0013\n32 2\n\u03ba\u2217\n6\u03bc + \u03ba\u2217 t.\n\u03ba(t) \u2192 \u03ba\u2217 < 0; z(t) \u2192 \u2212\n\u03c0\n9\nThe portrait for \u03bc < 0 is in Fig.4(a). Restricting our analysis to small |\u03ba(0)|, we observe\nthat walls with large separations repel and small separations attract. This is true both for\ninitially quiescent and slowly moving walls.\n\nD.\n\nNumerical study of the fixed points; all \u03b3\n\nAs we have seen in section IV, distant walls with A2 >\n\n4\n3\n\nare attracted to each other.\n\nWhether the attracting walls are going to form a stable bound state or collide and annihilate, depends on two factors: (i) whether a stable and unstable bound states exist for the\ncorresponding \u03b3 and A2 , and if yes, then (ii) how the initial interwall separation compares\nwith 2zu , the interwall separation in the unstable complex. For small \u03b3, the region where\nthe two complexes exist was found to be\n\n4\n3\n\n< A2 < A2sn , with A2sn as in Eq.(29). In order to\n\nclassify the outcomes of the wall attraction, we need to demarcate the corresponding region\nfor nonsmall \u03b3 as well.\n19\n\n\fThe one-dimensional dynamical system (20) has only one, stable, fixed point. In order to\ndescribe the unstable complex (which is bound tighter than the stable one, i.e. has a greater\n\u01eb), it is sufficient to retain the next, O(\u01eb7 ), term in Eq.(19) when we substitute (18) for \u03ba.\nHowever, despite capturing both the stable and unstable bound states, the system (18)-(19)\nwill not produce any reasonably-accurate description of the saddle-node bifurcation where\nthe two fixed points merge and disappear. One reason for this is that the term 32\u03c0\u03b3\u01eb2 \u03ba2 in\nEq.(16a) which was dropped from Eq.(19), becomes larger than \u01eb7 when we substitute (18)\nfor \u03ba. Another problem is that Eq.(18) keeps only the leading term in the \u03ba(\u01eb) expansion;\nretaining the next, O(\u01eb5 ), term in \u03ba(\u01eb) produces another term larger than \u01eb7 in Eq.(20).\nThus, in order to obtain an accurate variational description of the saddle-node bifurcation,\nwe need to return to the original, nonreduced, vector field (16). Denoting f (\u01eb, \u03ba) and g(\u01eb, \u03ba)\nthe right-hand sides of (16a) and (16b), the two fixed points arise as intersections of the\nnullclines\nf (\u01eb, \u03ba) = 0,\n\ng(\u01eb, \u03ba) = 0.\n\n(31)\n\nThe nullclines have a common tangent when\nf\u01eb (\u01eb, \u03ba)\ng\u01eb (\u01eb, \u03ba)\n=\n.\nf\u03ba (\u01eb, \u03ba)\ng\u03ba (\u01eb, \u03ba)\n\n(32)\n\nUsing a standard numerical routine to solve the system (31)-(32) for the vector of unknowns\n(\u01eb, \u03ba, A2 ), one can find the saddle-node value A2sn for each \u03b3.\nThe resulting curve A2 = A2sn (\u03b3) is shown in Fig.7 below (the dotted line), where it is\ncompared to the data from the numerical continuation of the wall complexes as solutions\nto Eq.(6). The significance of the curve is that it provides a borderline between the two\ndynamical scenarios: For A2 > A2sn , two N\u00e9el walls attract each other and annihilate; for\n4\n3\n\n< A2 < A2sn , the walls attract and annihilate if the initial separation 2z(0) < 2zu and form\n\na stable bound state if 2z(0) > 2zu .\nNote that the above numerical result is valid both for large and small \u03b3. For small \u03b3, our\nnumerical curve A2sn (\u03b3) is reproduced by the explicit formula (29).\nWe conclude this section by mentioning that the unstable fixed point exists for all A2 <\n\n4\n3\n\nfor which there are N\u00e9el walls, i.e. for 1 < A2 < 34 . This is a result of the numerical study\nof the system (31) with \u03b3 varying from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.01, and A2 varying from 1 to\n\n4\n3\n\nin steps of 0.001. The reservation that we should make here, however, is that when \u03b3 tends\nto 0 and, simultaneously, A2 tends to 1, the coordinate \u03ba of the saddle point approaches a\n20\n\n\fvalue of order 1. This contradicts the assumptions we made in the derivation of the system\n(16) and so the fixed point in this parameter region cannot represent any bound states of\nthe walls. (The value of the \u03ba-coordinate is reasonably small only when \u03b3 is greater than\n0.5 or when |A2 \u2212 43 | is smaller than 0.01.) Consequently, the variational analysis cannot\nprovide a trustworthy description of the small-distance dynamics of the walls in the \u03b3 \u2248 0,\nA2 \u2248 1 region. The direct numerical simulations of the full NLS equation (6) seem to be\nthe only reliable source of information here.\n\nV.\n\nBOUND STATE OF TWO DISSIPATIVE N\u00c9EL WALLS\n\nIn the previous section we showed that two bound states of N\u00e9el walls, a stable and an\nunstable one, exist in certain parts of the (\u03b3, h)-plane. Here, we will reobtain these solutions\nnumerically, demarcate their regions of existence and compare these to the corresponding\nvariational results.\nWe will be using the term \"solitonic bubble\" as a synonym for the wall complex. Treating\nbound states as independent soliton-like entities is meant to emphasise the significance of\nthese stationary solutions as possible attractors in the phase space; also, it should reflect\ntheir different, nontopological, nature. In fact, when the complex is tightly bound, it looks\nmore like a single entity than a wall doublet; see Fig.5.\nOur approach here is based on the numerical continuation (path-following) of the stationary bubbles as solutions to the ordinary differential equation\nA2\n\u03c8\n2 xx\n\n\u2212 A2 |\u03c8|2\u03c8 + \u03c8 + (A2 \u2212 1)\u03c8 \u2217 + i\u03b3(\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8 \u2217 ) = 0.\n\n(33)\n\nThe variational approximation (10) with parameters found in subsection IV C was used as\nan initial guess for the numerical solution at small \u03b3 and h \u2248 13 ; this, in turn, served as a\nstarting point for our continuation. We classified the stability of the resulting stationary\ncomplexes as solutions of the full partial differential equation (6), by linearising about the\nsolution and examining the spectrum of the linearised operator numerically.\nTo present results of the continuation graphically, we use the energy functional\n\u001b\nZ \u001a\n|\u03c8|2 + h Re(\u03c8 2 )\n1\n2\n4\n|\u03c8x | + |\u03c8| \u2212 2\n+ 1 dx.\nE=\n2\nA2\n\n(34)\n\nAlthough the quantity defined in Eq.(34) is not conserved for nonzero \u03b3, the energy can\nbe used as a bifurcation measure for stationary solutions. [The field momentum (14) is not\n21\n\n\fsuitable for this purpose as it satisfies \u1e56 = \u22122\u03b3P and so all stationary solutions with \u03b3 6= 0\nhave the same, zero, momentum.]\nA typical pair of bifurcation diagrams (corresponding to the separate continuations in\nh and \u03b3) is presented in Fig.6. [Fig.6 corresponds to \u03b3 = 0.35 (main frame) and h = 0.5\n(inset); the continuations for other fixed values of \u03b3 and h produce curves of similar shape].\nEach diagram consists of two branches; the entire branch with higher energy is found to be\nlinearly stable. The solutions on the lower branch are found to be unstable; the instability\nis associated with a (single) positive real eigenvalue. Numerical simulations of the full\ntime-dependent PDE (6) show that when perturbed, the unstable bubbles decay to the flat\nsolution.\nAs we approach the termination point of the top branch, the separation of the walls\np\nbecomes infinite. The termination point satisfies h \u2248 \u03b3 2 + 1/9 (i.e. A2 \u2248 34 ) - therefore,\n\nthis solution reproduces the stable bound state detected by the variational method (sections\n\nIV A, IV C). The solution on the lower branch corresponds to the unstable complex. We\nnote that this lower branch can be continued all the way to h = \u03b3, in agreement with\nvariational results in section IV D.\nThe walls pull closer together as we move towards the turning point along the upper\nbranch (in the main frame of Fig. 6). As we continue away from the turning point along the\nbottom branch, the distance between the walls continues to decrease, reaches a minimum,\nand then starts increasing. This nonmonotonicity can be explained in terms of the fixed\npoints of the dynamical system (25).\nThe existence and stability of the bound states is summarised in Fig.7. This figure\ncharts the (\u03b3, h)-plane into regions of different type of interaction between the walls. In the\nshaded region and above it, distant walls attract each other. The attraction may result in\nthe creation of a stable bound state at some finite separation; this happens in the shaded\ndomain. [The formation of the bound state is illustrated in Fig.8(c) below.] Above the\nshaded corridor, two attracting N\u00e9el walls are expected to collide and annihilate. Finally,\nin the region between the shaded area and the bisector line h = \u03b3, two N\u00e9el walls at large\nseparation repel.\nIn Fig.7, we also display the variational results for the saddle-node bifurcation curve\nhsn (\u03b3). The dotted line in the main frame gives the result of solution of the system of\nthree equations (31)-(32) while the dotted line in the inset was plotted using Eq.(29). The\n22\n\n\fvariational results are seen to be in good agreement with the outcome of the numerical\ncontinuation.\n\nVI.\n\nNUMERICAL SIMULATIONS: N\u00c9EL WALLS\n\nConclusions of the variational analysis were verified in direct numerical simulations of\nthe NLS equation (6). We used a split-step pseudospectral method [26], with N = 512\nFourier modes on the interval (\u2212L/2, L/2) = (\u221240, 40). The numerical scheme is stable for\nthe timesteps \u2206t < \u03c0 \u22121 (L/N)2 ; accordingly, we set \u2206t = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 . The method imposes\nperiodic boundary conditions. The initial condition had the form (10) where \u03ba1 and \u03ba2\nwere set equal to zero. The results are shown in Figs.8, where we have \"zoomed in\" on the\nsolitons neglecting the flanks of the simulation interval.\nTo verify the diagram of Fig.7, we examined three sequences of points on the (\u03b3, h)-plane:\none just above the shaded region, one just below it, and one inside. The sequence just above\nthe saddle-node line consisted of ten points \u03b3 = 0.0, 0.1, ..., 0.9 with h = 0.4 + 0.75\u03b3. For\neach pair of parameter values, we examined the initial separations 2z(0) = 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0.\nThe results were in agreement with the diagram of Fig.7: all simulations gave rise to the\nconvergence of the walls. For \u03b3 6= 0, this resulted in the annihilation of the walls [Fig.8(a)]\nwhile in the dissipation-free case, the convergence of the walls ended in the formation of a\nnonpropagating breather [Fig.8(b)].\np\nThe sequence just below the line h = \u03b3 2 + 1/9 consisted of \u03b3 = 0.0, 0.1, ..., 0.9 with\np\nh = \u03b3 2 + 0.09. In the \u03b3 = 0 case, the walls separated by 2z(0) = 4 were observed to repel\n\nwhereas those placed at a smaller distance 2z(0) = 3, attracted and formed a nonpropagating\nbreather. These results are in agreement with the variational analysis [see Fig.4(a)]. When\n\u03b3 is nonzero, the initial separations 2z(0) = 3.0 and 4.0 gave rise to the repulsion of the\n\nwalls. In order to observe the attraction, we had to reduce the initial distance to 2z(0) = 1.4\nfor \u03b3 = 0.1; to 2z(0) = 0.8 for \u03b3 = 0.2 and to 2z(0) = 0.1 for \u03b3 = 0.4. These observations\nare consistent with the fact that zu , the separation in the unstable complex, becomes smaller\nas \u03b3 grows.\nFinally, the sequence of points through the dashed region in Fig.7 included \u03b3 =\n0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.8 with h =\n\n1\n3\n\n+ 0.784\u03b3. For these values of h, the variational method pre-\n\ndicts a tightly bound stable complex of two walls and indeed, in all eight cases the walls\n23\n\n\fwith initial separations 2z(0) = 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 moved towards each other and formed a\nstable bound state at a certain smaller distance [Fig.8(c)].\nThus the simulations of the N\u00e9el wall interactions are in agreement with our expectations\nfor distant-wall dynamics summarised in Fig.7.\n\nVII.\n\nTWO BLOCH WALLS OF OPPOSITE CHIRALITIES\n\nProceeding to the analysis of Bloch walls, we remind the reader that the Bloch walls exist\nonly for \u03b3 = 0 and h < 31 ; these will be our assumptions in this section. Here, we consider\nthe interaction of two Bloch walls of opposite chiralities (i.e. with total field momentum\nP = 0). The corresponding lagrangian arises by setting \u03ba1 = \u03ba2 = \u03ba and B = B in Eq.(13).\nThe resulting equations of motion can be cast in the form of a hamiltonian system\n\u017c =\n\n1 \u2202H\n,\n\u03c0\u03c4 \u2202\u03ba\n\n\u03ba\u0307 = \u2212\n\n1 \u2202H\n,\n\u03c0\u03c4 \u2202z\n\n(35)\n\nwhere \u03c4 (\u01eb, \u03ba) is given by Eq.(24), and the Hamiltonian\nH(\u01eb, \u03ba) = \u2212\n\n16h 2\n2A2 2\n(\u03ba \u2212 \u03ba20 )2 +\n\u01eb\u03ba\n3B\nB\n8 2\n\u01eb [7 \u2212 9h \u2212 2(9 + 5h)\u03ba2 + (15 + 11h)\u03ba4 \u2212 4A2 \u03ba6 ]\n+\n3B\n+ 16A2 \u01eb2 z(2\u03ba2 \u2212 \u03ba20 \u2212 \u03ba4 ), (36)\n\nwith \u01eb = e\u22122Bz and \u03ba0 as in (9). Trajectories of the system (35) are simply level curves of\nthe function H(\u01eb, \u03ba).\nWhen the interwall separation is large, \u03ba should be close to its unperturbed value: \u03ba \u2248 \u03ba0\n\nor \u03ba \u2248 \u2212\u03ba0 , where \u03ba0 is, in general, O(1), but becomes small when h is near 31 . In the\nderivation of the variational equations, we assumed that the walls are well-separated and each\nwall is close to its unperturbed form. Therefore, only regions around the fixed points (0, \u03ba0 )\nand (0, \u2212\u03ba0 ) can be interpreted within the PDE (6) with full certainty. (Trajectories outside\nthose regions may also have infinite-dimensional counterparts but this requires verification\nusing direct numerical simulations of the full PDE). Note that \u03ba0 > 0 is the value of the\nimaginary part of the right-handed Bloch wall at its center [see Eq.(8)], and \u2212\u03ba0 < 0 is\nthe imaginary part of the left-handed Bloch wall at its center. Therefore, the point (0, \u03ba0 )\nrepresents a configuration of the right-handed wall at x = +\u221e and the left-handed antiwall\n24\n\n\fat x = \u2212\u221e. The point (0, \u2212\u03ba0 ) corresponds to the left-handed wall at x = +\u221e and the\nright-handed antiwall at x = \u2212\u221e.\n\nAssume, first, that h is not close to 0 or 31 . When \u01eb is small and \u03ba is close to \u00b1\u03ba0 (which\n\nare not small), terms in the third and second lines in (36) are much smaller than the second\nterm in the first line, and can be safely disregarded. The resulting dynamical system\n\u01eb\u0307 =\n\n16 2\nA \u01eb\u03ba(\u03ba2 \u2212 \u03ba20 ),\n3\n\n\u03ba\u0307 = 32h\u01eb\u03ba2 ,\n\ndoes not have fixed points with nonzero \u01eb and \u03ba; on the other hand, the entire \u03ba-axis is a line\nof nonisolated fixed points. All these points describe pairs of walls moving with constant\nvelocities \u00b1\u017c, where\n\u017c = \u2212\n\n8(1 + h)\n\u03ba(\u03ba2 \u2212 \u03ba20 ).\n3\u03c0B\n\nPoints on the positive-\u03ba semiaxis with \u03ba < \u03ba0 are stable and those with \u03ba > \u03ba0 unstable.\nPoints on the negative-\u03ba semiaxis with \u03ba < \u2212\u03ba0 are stable and those with \u03ba > \u2212\u03ba0 unstable.\n(See Fig.9.) Consequently, walls with large initial separation [\u01eb(0) near 0] and \u017c(0) > 0\ndiverge to infinities (\u01eb \u2192 0), whereas distant walls with \u017c(0) \u2264 0 converge.\nAs for the pairs of walls whose separation is not very large, the situation is straightforward\nfor the walls which are not moving initially [\u017c(0) = 0]; the corresponding initial conditions\nlie on the straight lines \u03ba = \u00b1\u03ba0 (dashed lines in Fig.9.) These initial conditions give rise\nto the convergence of the walls (i.e. \u01eb grows as t \u2192 \u221e). Otherwise, the type of interaction\ndepends on whether the point (\u01eb(0), \u03ba(0)) lies to the left or to the right of the heteroclinic\ntrajectory [the trajectory which connects the point (0, \u2212\u03ba0 ) to (0, \u03ba0 ) - this trajectory is\ntangent to the vertical axis in Fig.9.]\nThese variational conclusions are in agreement with direct numerical simulations of the\nfull PDE (6). (We employed the same numerical method as described in section VI.) The\ninitial condition was chosen in the form of two Bloch walls of the opposite chirality which\nare initially at rest, i.e. Eq.(10) with \u03ba1 = \u03ba2 = \u03ba0 . The initially quiescent walls have always\nbeen observed to attract; see Fig.10.\nWhen h is close to 13 , \u03ba0 is small; since \u03ba is assumed to be in the vicinity of \u00b1\u03ba0 , we\ncannot neglect terms in the third and second lines in (36) in favour of the first line. However,\nit is sufficient to keep just the leading term (the term proportional to 7 \u2212 9h in the second\nline). A straightforward analysis reveals then that the situation here is similar to the one\nconsidered above: there are no fixed points with small nonzero \u01eb, while the \u03ba-axis is a line\n25\n\n\fof nonisolated fixed points, stable for \u03ba(\u03ba2 \u2212 \u03ba20 ) < 0 and unstable otherwise. Therefore the\nphase portrait for small \u01eb and \u03ba is similar to the one above.\nWhen h is close to 0, the last term in the first line of (36) becomes small and hence no\nterms in the third and second lines can be discarded. In this case, the dynamics can be\nanalysed by plotting level curves of H using standard software. The same approach was\nadopted to study the vector field outside the small-\u01eb region.\nThe resulting phase portrait is shown in Fig.9 for h = 0.1; the portrait does not undergo\nany qualitative transformations as h is increased up to\n\n1\n3\n\nor decreased down to 0. A striking\n\nfeature of Fig.9 is the existence of three families of closed orbits: one centred on a point\nwith \u03ba \u2248 1; a mirror-reflected family centred on a point with \u03ba \u2248 \u22121; and a family of closed\ntrajectories centred on a point on the horizontal axis.\nThe closed trajectories centered on the fixed point with \u03ba \u2248 1 represent a family of\nbreather solutions of the NLS (1) (and so do their mirror-reflected twins). These breathers\nhave been observed in our numerical simulations of the full partial differential equation\n(6); see Fig.10. They can also be constructed perturbatively (see section IX below). The\nnonlinear-center fixed point is sandwiched between two saddles, one below it (clearly visible\nin Fig.9) and one above. As h is decreased, the two saddle points approach each other. As\na result, the periodic orbits are compressed in the vertical direction, and, as h reaches zero,\nthe family of closed trajectories degenerates into a segment of the straight line \u03ba = 1.\nThe closed loops about a nonlinear-centre fixed point with \u03ba = 0 represent another family\nof temporally-periodic solutions. Since the value of \u03ba for a free-standing wall (i.e. \u03ba0 ) is close\nto zero only when h is close to 13 , the family centred on \u03ba = 0 admits a reliable interpretation\nonly in this limit. When h = 0, the center point has the coordinate \u01eb \u2248 0.06; as h grows\nto\n\n1\n,\n3\n\nthe centre moves towards the origin so that the family of closed orbits shrinks to\n\na single point \u01eb = 0, \u03ba = 0. For h close to 13 , i.e. in the region where these solutions\ncan be interpreted in terms of the two-wall Ansatz (10), the closed trajectories describe a\npair of Bloch walls of opposite chiralities executing periodic oscillations of their separation\n(but remaining far away from each other.) These oscillatory \"doublets\" have not yet been\nobserved in direct numerical simulations and their existence remains an open problem. (See\nthe concluding section for a possible explanation of the \"nonvisibility\" of these objects.)\n\n26\n\n\fVIII.\n\nTWO BLOCH WALLS OF LIKE CHIRALITIES\n\nFinally, we examine the case of a pair of Bloch walls (more precisely, a wall and an\nantiwall) of the same chirality. As in the previous section, we let \u03b3 = 0 and consider h < 31 .\nAssume, for definiteness, that we have a right-handed pair. When at rest, the well-separated\nwall and antiwall have equal (nonzero) momenta PB = \u2212\u03c0\u03ba0 where \u03ba0 is as in (9). When\nthe walls start moving as a result of their interaction, the total momentum remains the same\nand hence the individual field momenta of the two walls will change by the same amount:\none will become P1 = \u2212\u03c0(\u03ba0 + q) and the other one P2 = \u2212\u03c0(\u03ba0 \u2212 q). This means that\none of the walls will have the amplitude of its imaginary part increase by q and the other\none decrease by q, and so we will not have a symmetric configuration of an equal-amplitude\nwall and antiwall any longer. Therefore one may question the validity of our assumption\nthat the two walls remain equal distance away from the origin for t > 0. To see that the\nequal-distance Ansatz (10) remains valid - at least for not too late times - we note that\nthe velocity-momentum curve P (v) of a single Bloch wall has a nonzero slope at the point\nv = 0, P = PB (see [5]; the curve is also reproduced in part II of the present series of papers\n[19]). This means that the wall whose momentum has increased by \u2206P = \u03c0q, acquires the\nvelocity \u2206v, while the wall whose momentum has decreased by \u2206P = \u03c0q, starts moving with\nthe velocity \u2212\u2206v where \u2206v = (dP/dv)\u22121\u2206P . Accordingly, if two walls are equal distance\nfrom the origin initially, they will remain equally far from the origin for all t > 0. This\nsymmetric arrangement will break down only if \u2206P is very large or if (dP/dv)\u22121 is very\nsmall, in which case one would have to take into account deviations of the shape of the P (v)\ncurve from a straight line. The derivative (dP/dv)\u22121 tends to zero only if h \u2192\n\n1\n3\n\nand indeed,\n\nnumerical simulations do reveal nonsymmetric motion of like-chirality walls when h is very\nclose to\n\n1\n3\n\n(see below), but outside this narrow region the symmetric Ansatz (10) remains\n\nvalid.\nLetting \u03ba1 = \u2213\u03ba0 + q, \u03ba2 = \u00b1\u03ba0 + q and B = B in the Lagrangian (13), we get equations describing the dynamics of two like-chirality Bloch walls. These can be written as a\nhamiltonian system\n\u017c =\n\n1 \u2202H\n,\n\u03c0\u03c4 \u2202q\n\nq\u0307 = \u2212\n\n1 \u2202H\n,\n\u03c0\u03c4 \u2202z\n\nwhere\n\u03c4 (\u01eb, q) = 1 + 2\u01eb[1 \u2212 14\u01eb \u2212 3(1 \u2212 6\u01eb)\u03ba20 + (1 + 10\u01eb)q 2 ] > 0\n27\n\n(37a)\n\n\fand the Hamiltonian\nH(z, q) = \u2212\n\n2A2\n16h 2\n(4\u03ba20 + q 2 )q 2 \u2212\n\u01eb(\u03ba0 \u2212 q 2 )\n3B\nB\n\u0014\n\u03ba2\n8 2\n\u01eb 7 \u2212 9h \u2212 02 (7 + 38h + 79h2 )\n+\n3B\nA\n\u0015\n4\n2 2\n4\n2 6\n\u2212 2 (3 + 12h + h )q + (19 \u2212 h)q \u2212 4A q\nA\n+ 16\u01eb2 z[4h\u03ba20 + 4(1 \u2212 h)q 2 \u2212 A2 q 4 ]. (37b)\n\nAssume, first, that h is not close to 13 , so that \u03ba0 is not a small quantity. In this case the\nHamiltonian (37b) with small \u01eb and q is dominated just by two terms,\nH(z, q) \u2248 \u2212\n\n8 2 2 2 16h 2\nA \u03ba0 q \u2212\n\u03ba \u01eb.\n3B\nB 0\n\n(38)\n\nAs in the previous section, the q-axis in this case is a line of nonisolated fixed points.\nSince \u017c \u2248 \u2212(16A2 \u03ba20 /3\u03c0B)q, points with q > 0 and q < 0 represent pairs of converging\n\nand diverging walls, respectively. The trajectories are parabolas \u01eb = \u01eb\u2217 \u2212 (A2 /6h)q 2 ; they\nstart at points on the positive-q semiaxis and flow into points on the negative-q semiaxis.\nThis implies that the initially diverging walls continue to diverge whereas the walls initially\nmoving towards each other shall stop at some finite separation, and then repel to infinities.\n(A simple but practically important situation concerns walls which are initially at rest; these\nwill obviously start repelling straight away.) The above conclusion applies, of course, only to\nslowly moving walls which are sufficiently far from each other [i.e. \u01eb(0) and q(0) are small].\nFig.11(a) displays a typical result of direct numerical simulation of the interaction of two\nlike-chirality Bloch walls within Eq.(6). We tested several values of h and a variety of z(0).\nThe initial condition was taken in the form (10) with \u03ba1 = \u2212\u03ba0 and \u03ba2 = \u03ba0 . In agreement\nwith conclusions of the variational analysis, the initially quiescent walls were observed to\nrepel for all h not very close to 31 . (The case of h close to\n\n1\n3\n\nis discussed below.)\n\nAs h tends to zero, the phase portrait does not undergo any qualitative changes. However,\nthe turning point of the parabola starting at a point q\u2217 on the q-axis, \u01eb\u2217 = (6h)\u22121/2 Aq\u2217 ,\nis shifted out of the small-\u01eb region, i.e. out of the range of applicability of variational\napproximation. Consequently, we can no longer expect the initially converging walls to stop\na large distance away from each other and repel to infinities after that. Instead, for h \u223c 0\nthe colliding like-chirality Bloch walls should penetrate into the core of each other, and the\n28\n\n\fnumerical simulations of the full PDE could be the only way to study the outcome of this\ndeep impact.\nNext, let h be near 31 . In this case the Hamiltonian (37b) with small \u01eb and q reduces to\n8\nH(z, q) \u2248 \u2212 (4\u03ba20 q 2 + q 4 + 6\u03ba20 \u01eb \u2212 6\u01ebq 2 \u2212 12\u01eb2 ).\n9\nThe dynamics with very small \u01eb and q is similar to the one described by Eq.(38): distant\npairs of walls with \u017c > 0 diverge while those which are initially set to converge (\u017c < 0) slow\ndown, stop and then repel to infinities [Fig.12(a)]. A new feature in the (h \u2248 31 )-case is a\n\nsaddle point at (\u01eb, q) = ( 14 \u03ba20 , 0) and a region of attraction which is separated from the region\nof repulsion by the stable manifold of the saddle [Fig.12(a)]. This fixed point was previously\n\ndiscovered in a variational analysis of the (2:1)-resonantly forced Ginsburg-Landau equation\n[27]. Although it would be tempting to think that it represents a stationary complex of two\nBloch walls of like chiralities, the actual interpretation of the stationary point turns out to\nbe somewhat different.\nIndeed, it was proved in [21] that in the absence of damping, two Bloch or two N\u00e9el\nwalls cannot form stationary complexes. On the other hand, letting \u03ba1 = \u2212\u03ba2 = \u2212\u03ba0 and\n\ne\u22122z = \u03ba20 /4 with small \u03ba0 , the trial function (10) can be written, approximately, as\ne2x + e\u22122x \u2212 e2z\n,\ne2x + e\u22122x + e2z\n4(ex \u2212 e\u2212x )\nIm \u03c8 = 2x\n.\ne + e\u22122x + e2z\n\nRe \u03c8 =\n\nThis coincides with the expression for the Bloch-N\u00e9el bound state {Eq.(11) of Ref.[19]} with\n\ns = 0 and \u03c3 = \u22121, where we only need to send B \u2192 1 and make the identification e2\u03b2 = 12 e2z .\n\nTherefore, the \"bound state\" of two like-chirality Bloch walls produced by the variational\nanalysis is, in fact, the Bloch-N\u00e9el complex with s = 0. The reason why the Bloch-N\u00e9el\ncomplex could be mistaken for a complex of two Bloch walls, was simply because the Bloch\nand N\u00e9el walls become indistinguishable as h \u2192 31 .\nThe appearance of the region of attraction for h close to\n\n1\n3\n\ndeserves a special comment.\n\nThe attraction becomes possible due to the smallness of \u03ba0 in this limit. Indeed, for sufficiently small \u03ba0 , the momentum \u03ba1 = \u2213\u03ba0 + q becomes close to \u03ba2 = \u00b1\u03ba0 + q - which is\ncharacteristic for two Bloch walls of opposite chirality. Thus, in the limit h \u2192 31 , the walls\nmay effectively change their chiralities.\n29\n\n\fIt is instructive to consider the full phase portrait of the system (37); we produce it by\nplotting level curves of the Hamiltonian (37b) beyond the region of small \u01eb and \u03ba [Fig.12(b)].\nA remarkable feature here is a family of closed orbits surrounding a nonlinear-center point.\nThe center is born, along with the saddle point, in a saddle-center bifurcation as h is increased\npast 0.189. The presence of periodic orbits suggests that breathers may be formed in the\ncollision of Bloch walls of like chirality.\nAs h \u2192 31 , the saddle point ( 41 \u03ba20 , 0) moves closer to the origin and so the periodic orbits\npass near \u01eb = 0. Accordingly, in this limit the breathers should be accessible from initial\nconditions in the form of well-separated pairs of walls. We note, however, that all closed\norbits pass also through a region of large \u01eb. [In fact, as h \u2192\n\n1\n,\n3\n\nthe coordinate of the\n\nnonlinear center tends to infinity: \u01ebc \u2192 exp(1/\u03ba20 ).] Consequently, the formation of the\nbreathers requires accurate testing within the full PDE. In our numerical simulations with h\nclose to 31 , we have indeed observed the attraction of walls with moderate separations (e.g.\nwith \u01eb = 0.005 in the case of h = 0.33 and \u01eb = 0.001 in the case of h = 0.333) followed\nby the formation of a breather [Fig.11(b)]. It is interesting to note that the attraction of\ntwo like-chirality walls with h \u223c\n\n1\n3\n\nproceeds via the chirality transmutation: first, one of\n\nthe walls changes its chirality to the opposite; after that, the two opposite-chirality walls\nattract.\nFinally, we need to mention an anomaly in the interaction of two like-chirality walls which\nwas observed in some of our simulations with h near 13 . The walls which are initially at rest\nand equal distance away from the origin, would start moving with different velocities or even\nin the same direction - violating our Ansatz (10) based on the assumption of a symmetric\narrangement for all t. This asymmetric anomaly is observed in a wider range of h-values\nnear h =\n\n1\n3\n\nthan the chirality transmutation (we detected the former for h as far from\n\n1\n3\n\nas\n\nh = 0.30) and has a straightfoward explanation in terms of the P (v) curve. As h \u2192 31 , the\nderivative dP/dv tends to infinity at the points where the S-shaped P (v)-curve intersects\nthe P -axis and so the equation \u2206v = (dP/dv)\u22121\u2206P has to be amended by keeping the\nsymmetry-breaking term in (\u2206P )2 . It is this term that causes the asymmetric motion of the\ntwo walls. The anomalous interaction is typical for Bloch-N\u00e9el pairs and can be interpreted\nas the interaction of particles with the opposite mass sign [19].\nThe fact that the motion of two walls has to be asymmetric becomes even more obvious\nif one notices that the left and right turning points of the S-curve approach v = 0 as h \u2192 31 .\n30\n\n\fAs a result, the motion in the direction of the turning point becomes hampered. When h is\nextremely close to 13 , a new channel of interaction becomes available; namely, the wall which\nis repelled by its partner in the \"hard\" direction, may \"tunnel\" through the P (v)-barrier\nby means of the chirality transmutation, and the original symmetric arrangement remains\nundisturbed.\n\nIX.\n\nOTHER LOCALISED ATTRACTORS: NONDISSIPATIVE BREATHERS\n\nIn the nondissipative situation (\u03b3 = 0), colliding walls form a moving or quiescent\nbreather: a temporally oscillating, spatially localised structure. The breather was formed,\nfor at least a short time, in every undamped collision that we simulated. The formation of\nthe breather is accompanied by the release of a large amount of radiation; the numerical\nsimulations reveal that the breather carries only about a quarter of the energy of the initial\nconfiguration, and so the remaining three quarters must escape into the radiation field. As a\nresult, when the interval of simulation is too short, the interaction of the breather with the\nradiation re-entering the interval via the periodic boundaries is strong enough to destroy it\nafter just a few oscillations. On a large interval, however, the amplitude of the re-entering\nradiation is small due to the dispersive broadening, and the breather persists indefinitely.\nThe breather can be easily constructed perturbatively. First of all, a harmonic solution\n\u03b4\u03c8 = ei(\u03c9t\u2212kx) of the NLS (6) linearised about \u03c8 = 1 obeys the dispersion relation\n\u00132\n\u0012\nk2\n\u03c9 = 1 + 2h +\n\u2212 1.\n2\n2\n\n\u221a\nThe (k = 0)-harmonic oscillates with a nonzero frequency \u03c90 = 2 hA; therefore, one may\nalso expect to find a broad small-amplitude breather oscillating with that frequency.

All runs resulted in\nthe formation of a breather, although in some cases [for |\u03b1| & 0.3], the emerging breather\nwould break into a pair of counterpropagating breathers. In those cases where the emerging\nbreather was nonmoving, its shape and frequency were found to be in an excellent agreement\nwith the asymptotic formula (45).\n\nX.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND OPEN PROBLEMS\n\nIn this paper, we studied the interactions between the similar-type dark solitons of the\nnonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, i.e. Bloch-Bloch and N\u00e9el-N\u00e9el interactions. Our approach\nwas based on the variational approximation (also known as the collective-coordinate, or\nvariation-of-action, method). The variational conclusions were verified using numerical continuation of solutions of the stationary damped-driven NLS (33) and via direct numerical\nsimulations of the full partial differential equation (6).\n\nA.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn the dissipative situation (\u03b3 6= 0), the only available solitons are the N\u00e9el walls. When\n\ntwo N\u00e9el walls are very far apart, their interaction is simple: the walls repel if h2 < \u03b3 2 +\n\n1\n9\n\nand attract if h2 > \u03b3 2 + 19 . The repelling walls diverge to infinities; as for the case of\nattraction, there are two possible scenarios. In order to distinguish between the two, one is\nled to consider the situation where the walls are closer to each other [but still sufficiently\nfar apart for the large-separation approximation (10) to remain valid.]\nAt these shorter distances, the dynamics is influenced by two bound states, a stable and\np\nan unstable one. The stable bound state exists for h between \u03b3 2 + 1/9 and a threshold\n33\n\n\fdriving strength hsn , and the unstable one exists for all h < hsn . Here h2sn = \u03b3 2 + (A2sn \u2212 1)2\n\nwhere A2sn (\u03b3) is defined as a root of the system (31)-(32). For small \u03b3, the curve hsn (\u03b3) can\nbe described explicitly:\n1\n+ 0.3048\u03b3 2/3 .\n(48)\n3\n[This is Eq.(29) written in terms of h and \u03b3.] In their region of coexistence, the stable\nhsn =\n\ncomplex has a larger separation: 2zs > 2zu .\np\nWhen h is smaller than \u03b3 2 + 1/9, the walls repel if their separation distance 2z(0) is\n\ngreater than 2zu , the interwall separation in the unstable complex. If 2z(0) < 2zu , the\nwalls converge and annihilate. (This verdict does not extend to the region where both h\n\nand \u03b3 are small. In this region the variational analysis of the small-separation dynamics is\np\ninconclusive.) When \u03b3 2 + 1/9 < h < hsn , pairs of N\u00e9el walls with separations 2z(0) larger\nthan 2zu evolve towards the stable bound state while those with 2z(0) < 2zu converge and\nannihilate. Finally, the walls with h > hsn converge and annihilate irrespectively of their\ninitial separation. These results pertain to walls at shorter distances (which are however\nsufficiently far apart for the variational approximation to remain valid). In particular, they\nanswer the question as to what finally happens to the two walls attracted from very large\ndistances.\nThe nondissipative case requires a separate summary. Here the walls can move at constant\nspeeds and the interaction pattern becomes complicated by the presence of inertia. When h\nis greater than\n\n1\n3\n\n(by small or large value), the N\u00e9el walls attract and converge - unless the\n\ninitial condition corresponds to walls having large and opposite velocities. In the latter case\nthe attraction is unable to stop the diverging walls and they escape to infinities. On the\nother hand, when h is smaller than 31 , the walls repel. The exception here is the case where\nh is close to 13 ; in this case walls with very large separations repel whereas walls which are\nnot so far from each other, attract.\nIn the dissipation-free case, the available dark solitons also include Bloch walls. The\ninteraction between two Bloch walls depends on their relative chiralities: two initially quiescent, oppositely-handed Bloch walls attract while two quiescent walls with like chiralities\nplaced at a large distance away from each other, repel. The exception is the case of h close\nto 31 ; in this limit, two walls of like chirality repel at large distances but exhibit anomalous\ninteraction or transmute into an opposite-chirality pair and attract \u2013 when placed closer to\neach other.\n34\n\n\fThese conclusions can be extended to the case of the moving Bloch walls, where one just\nneeds to take their inertia into account. For example, two initially diverging oppositelyhanded walls at large separation will continue to diverge despite the attraction whereas two\nlikely-handed walls which were initially moving against each other, will continue to converge\n(until the repulsion stops them and sends away to infinities).\nIn addition to the interactions between well-separated walls, we investigated products\nof their collision. When the system is not damped, the collision of two walls results in a\nstationary or travelling breather. We reconstructed the numerically found breather as an\nasymptotic series.\nWhen \u03b3 is nonzero, oscillations are damped and the only nontrivial product of collision\nof two N\u00e9el walls is a stationary bubble - the bound state of two N\u00e9el walls. Using the\nnumerical continuation of solutions to the ODE (33), we demarcated the bubble's domain\nof existence in the parameter space. [This domain is, naturally, a subset of the part of\nthe (\u03b3, h)-plane in which remote walls attract]. The numerical demarcation is in excellent\nagreement with the domain of existence obtained variationally.\n\nB.\n\nOpen Problems\n\n1. We complete the paper by listing several open problems to which we plan to return in\nfuture. One interesting problem that merits further investigation, concerns the (unstable)\nbubble solution with small h and \u03b3. (This solution is exemplified by Fig.13.) Our numerics\nand the variational analysis in section IV D show that this solution cannot be regarded as\na complex of two N\u00e9el walls, not even strongly overlapping ones. Its asymptotic behaviour\nis closer to that of a Bloch wall; however, Bloch walls do not exist in presence of damping.\nFurthermore, the bubble cannot be continued to \u03b3 = 0 and hence does not have a nondissipative analogue in the form of a bound state of two Bloch, or a Bloch and a N\u00e9el, walls.\n(This follows from the fact that the N\u00e9el wall is the only solution in the \u03b3 = 0 domain which\nadmits continuation to nonzero \u03b3 as it is the only solution with zero momentum [5].) Thus a\nquestion arises whether the bubble with small h and \u03b3 could be interpreted as a complex of\ntwo hypothetical \"dissipative Bloch walls\" of opposite chiralities - which do not exist individually but can exist as a bound state due to the cancellation of their opposite momenta. A\nsimilar momentum cancellation occurs in the attractive damped-driven NLS where it allows\n35\n\n\fcomplexes to travel with nonzero speeds despite the fact that their constituent solitons are\nimmobile [28].\nA related question concerns the short-distance N\u00e9el wall dynamics with small h and \u03b3.\nThis problem is inaccessible to the variational method, and the direct numerical simulations\nof the full PDE seems to be the only appropriate line of attack here.\n2. With regard to the Bloch walls, an open problem concerns the family of closed orbits\ncentred on \u03ba = 0 in Fig.9. When h is close to 31 , these periodic orbits can be interpreted\nwithin the full partial differential equation (1), as pairs of opposite-chirality Bloch walls\nexecuting periodic oscillations of their separation. It is not impossible that these periodic\nsolutions exist also for h not so close to\n\n1\n3\n\n[where the validity of the well-separated Ansatz\n\n(10) becomes questionable.] It remains to be understood why these orbits have not been\nobserved in our numerical simulations of Eq.(1), with either h. One possible explanation\nstems from the fact that the nonlinear-center fixed point enclosed by this family of closed\norbits, corresponds to a maximum of the energy (13c). Consequently, the nonlinear modes\nnot captured by our two-dimensional Ansatz (10) - such as radiations - should make\nthe point (\u01eb, \u03ba) slide downhill towards orbits with larger radii, until it crosses through the\nhomoclinic trajectory and ends up at \u01eb = 0. [It is pertinent to note here that the centre\npoints enclosed by the other two families of closed orbits in Fig.9 are minima of the energy\n(13c); this is consistent with the stability of the corresponding breather solutions observed\nin numerical simulations in Section VI.]\n3. Next, it would be interesting to simulate collisions of the like-chirality Bloch walls\nwith h \u223c 0. This case is not amenable to the variational analysis due to the large extent\n(\"width\") of the walls.\n4. It would also be interesting to gain a deeper theoretical insight into the anomalous\ninteraction of the like-chirality Bloch walls arising for h close to 31 . The variational approach remains a proper tool here; one should only generalise the Ansatz (10) by allowing\nnonsymmetric configurations of the walls:\n\u03c61 (x, t) = tanh [B(x + z1 )] \u2212 i\u03ba1 sech[B(x + z1 )],\n\u03c62 (x, t) = tanh [B(x \u2212 z2 )] + i\u03ba2 sech[B(x \u2212 z2 )].\nHere z1 , z2 and \u03ba1 , \u03ba2 are unrelated pairs of variables.\n5. Finally, one more future challenge is the analysis of the interaction of two breathers\n36\n\n\fand their synchronisation to a common frequency.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nIt is a pleasure to thank Boris Malomed for useful references.

In the absence of\ndamping, the attraction results in the formation of a stationary breather (b) (here h = 0.5). Simulations\nreported in panels (a,b) correspond to a point (\u03b3, h) lying above the shaded region in Fig.7 while those\nin panel (c) pertain to a point inside this region. All panels show the real part of \u03c8, multiplied by \u22121\nfor better visualization.\n\n43\n\n\f1\n\n0.5\n\n\u03ba\n\n0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n\u22121\n0\n\n0.2\n\n\u03b5\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nFIG. 9: Trajectories of the system (35) obtained as level curves of the Hamiltonian (36). (Here\nh = 0.1.) Two points at which the trajectory is tangent to the \u03ba-axis, correspond to stationary pairs\nof walls. The dashed lines are \u03ba = \u00b1\u03ba0 ; the initial conditions lying on these lines pertain to stationary\nwalls: \u017c(0) = 0.\n\nFIG. 10: Attraction of Bloch walls with opposite chirality; this attraction results in a long-lived breather.\n(In this plot, h = 0.1). To highlight the chiralities of the Bloch walls, the imaginary part of \u03c8 is shown.\n(We remind that in the case of the wall-antiwall configuration that we are considering, the same signs\nof the imaginary parts imply opposite chiralities of the walls.)\n\n44\n\n\fFIG. 11: Interaction of Bloch walls of like chiralities. The imaginary part of \u03c8 is shown. (a) Repulsion\nfor generic h. (Here h = 0.15). (b) For h close to 13 , the walls may attract and produce a breather on\ncollision. (In this plot, h = 0.333). Note that before the walls start converging, the wall on the left\nchanges its chirality to the opposite. (We remind that in the case of the wall-antiwall configuration\nthat we are considering, opposite signs of imaginary parts imply like chiralities of the walls.)\n\n0.1\n\nq\n\n0.3\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nq\n\n0\n\n\u22120.1\n0\n\n0.0025\n\n\u03b5\n\n0.005\n\n0.0075\n\n0\n\n\u22120.3\n0\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b5\n\n0.8\n\nFIG. 12: Trajectories of two Bloch walls with like chiralities on the (\u01eb, q)-plane.
