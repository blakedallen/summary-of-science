Introduction\nGraphene is a material of considerable interest on account of its unusual linearlydispersive Dirac band structure and particle-hole symmetry.[1, 2] Vacancy constitutes\nan important defect center, the electronic structure of which forms the basic foundation\nfor the understanding of the behavior of more complex defects including impurities.\nRecently it has been suggested that transition-metal doped graphene with vacancies\nmay have potential application in hydrogen storage.[3] Experimentally, vacancies in\ngraphene have been created intentionally by irradiating materials with electrons and\nions[4, 5, 6, 7] and they may also occur in small concentration during the growth\nprocess.[8] While an ideal graphene sheet is non-magnetic, experimental observation\nof magnetism in carbon systems has been long explained in terms of a variety of defects\nincluding isolated vacancies, vacancy clusters, or presence of internal or external\nboundaries as in nanoribbons.[7, 9, 10, 11]\nThere have been several theoretical studies of the isolated vacancy in graphene\nfrom first-principles density-functional theory (DFT)[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,\n21, 22] or Hartree-Fock calculations[23] as well as from tight-binding models[25, 26, 27].\nThere is also an enormous amount of related work on the chemisorbed defects such as\nthe hydrogen defects and chemisorbed magnetic atoms.[28] Most of the tight-binding\n\n\fElectronic structure of the substitutional vacancy in graphene: Density-functional and Green's function studies3\nV \u03c33\nE\nV\u03c0\n\nEF\n\nV \u03c32\n\nV\u03c3\n\nA\nCrystal\nfield\n\nV \u03c31\nJahn\u2212\nTeller\n\nExchange\n\nFigure 2. Splitting of the three dangling bond sp2 \u03c3 states of the carbon triangle,\ndenoted by V\u03c3, and the vacancy-induced zero-mode V\u03c0 state originating from the\n\u03c0 band. The splitting of the V\u03c3 states is discussed in detail in Section 3.\n\nmodels have focused on the \u03c0 bands only, which is clearly inadequate due to the\nformation of the sp2 \u03c3 dangling bonds in the mid-gap region. The first-principles\ncalculations do include all relevant states in the band structure including the sp2 \u03c3\nstates; however, in spite of all these works, a clear picture of the vacancy states has\nnot emerged.\nIn this paper, we study the electronic structure of the vacancy in graphene using\nthe all-electron density functional linear augmented plane waves (LAPW) method\nalong with tight-binding studies as well as the impurity Green's function (GF)\napproach to interpret the band structure. To our knowledge, this is the first allelectron density functional calculation for the vacancy in graphene reported in the\nliterature. We have already reported the electronic structure for the mono and bilayer\ngraphenes using the same method.[29] In addition to the DFT calculations, the nature\nof the vacancy-induced states is modeled from the tight-binding and Green's function\nstudies, which help interpret the DFT results.\nThe basic overall picture of the electronic structure that emerges from our work\nis summarized in Fig. 1. It shows the standard \u03c3 and \u03c0 bands of graphene plus the\nvacancy-induced states, denoted by V\u03c0 and V\u03c3, which are split due to the crystal\nfield, Jahn-Teller, and the Hund's-rule interactions. The V\u03c3 states are made out of\nthe three sp2 \u03c3 dangling bond states, which are located on the three carbon atoms\nadjacent to the vacancy with their lobes directed towards the vacancy site. With\ntheir bonding partners missing, they occur in the midgap region. At the same time,\na localized state V\u03c0 gets introduced in the \u03c0 bands in the midgap region as well,\nthe so called \"zero mode\" state, whose energy is exactly zero in the nearest-neighbor\ntight binding approximation. These four states, localized around the vacancy center,\ncan hold eight electrons in total taking into account the spin degeneracy. The level\nstructure of the vacancy-induced states is shown in Fig. 2.\nAt the same time, electron counting arguments show that the vacancy releases\nfour electrons to be occupied among the above localized states. These electrons include\nthe three orphan sp2 \u03c3 electrons, one from each of the three carbon atoms adjacent\nto the vacancy, plus one orphan \u03c0 electron, whose origin may be understood in the\nfollowing way. Focusing on the \u03c0 states now and considering a vacancy on the A\n\n\fElectronic structure of the substitutional vacancy in graphene: Density-functional and Green's function studies4\nsublattice, the majority sublattice B has one extra atom, NB \u2212 NA = 1, so that the\ntotal number of \u03c0 orbitals is NA + NB , which is the same as 2NA + 1. Out of these,\nthere is one zero-mode state and the electron-hole symmetry of the graphene lattice\nresults in NA band states below E = 0 and the same number above it. (See Fig. 7\nfor the \u03c0 band structure). So, of the 2NA + 1 \u03c0 electrons (one per atom), 2NA fill up\nthe lower bands, leaving a lone orphan \u03c0 electron. These four orphan electrons (three\n\u03c3 and one \u03c0) occupy the vacancy-induced states as indicated in Fig. 1.\nThe remaining sections are organized as follows. In Section II, we discuss\nthe results of our DFT calculations. Section III discusses the crystal-field and\nJahn-Teller splitting of the vacancy-induced localized \u03c3 states and Section IV is\ndevoted to the vacancy-induced \u03c0 states. In Section IV A, we revisit the zero-mode\ntheorem and in Section IV B, we present numerical results for the \u03c0 states from\na numerical diagonalization of the tight-binding Hamiltonian before discussing the\nvacancy-induced \u03c0 states using the Green's function approach in Sections IV C and\nD. Finally the results are summarized in Section V.\n2. Density-Functional Calculations\nFor the density-functional calculations, we used the all-electron spin-polarized linear\naugmented plane wave (LAPW) method[30] with the general gradient approximation\n(GGA)[31] for the exchange-correlation functional. A 72-atom 6\u00d76 supercell was used\nwhich included one vacancy site. The LAPW basis functions included the carbon 2s\nand 2p valence orbitals and a momentum cutoff of RKmax = 5.2 was used, with\napproximately 3500 basis functions and about 50,000 plane waves at each k point.\nAll atomic sphere radii were taken as 0.66 \u00c5. The maximum angular momentum for\nthe wave function expansion inside the atomic sphere was kept at lmax = 6. Thirty\nk points in the irreducible Brillouin zone were found to be sufficient for converged\nresults in the self-consistent calculations.\nRelaxed structure \u2013 First we performed a structural optimization of the lattice\nconstant for pure graphene which yielded about the same lattice constant as the\nexperimental value. For the vacancy calculation, the lattice constant was held fixed\nat the experimental value and a structural relaxation was performed for the entire\nstructure. The optimization yielded a planar Jahn-Teller (JT) distorted carbon\ntriangle around the vacancy with the carbon atoms outside the triangle relaxed by\na much smaller amount. For the carbon triangle, we found two long bonds of length\n2.66 \u00c5 each and a short bond of length 2.40 \u00c5 (Fig. 3), as compared to the 2.48\n\u00c5 for the undistorted structure. In terms of the standard Jahn-Teller modes of the\nequilateral triangle, the magnitudes of the distortion are: Q0 = 0.08 \u00c5 (breathing\nmode), Q1 = 0.166 \u00c5 (symmetric bond-bending mode), and Q2 = 0 (asymmetric\nmode).[32]\nThe relaxed structure for the vacancy reported in the literature varies widely.\nWhile some have reported planar structures,[13, 17, 15, 16, 23, 14] others have found\nnon-planar structures with out-of-plane displacements varying from \u03b4z \u2248 0.12 \u2212 0.47\n\u00c5.[12, 19, 20, 21, 22] We find that a paramagnetic relaxation (less accurate for the\npresent problem) yields a non-planar structure \u03b4z \u2248 0.27 \u00c5, while a spin-polarized\ncalculation yields a planar structure, an observation made by Faccio et al.[17] from\ntheir calculations as well using the SIESTA code. We attribute this wide variation in\nthe calculated relaxed structure in the literature partly to the unusual nature of the\nV\u03c0 bound state, which falls off only as 1/r, leading to a larger width of the V\u03c0 band\n\n\fElectronic structure of the substitutional vacancy in graphene: Density-functional and Green's function studies5\n\n2\n\nV\n2.40 \u00c5\n\n2.6\n\n2.6\n\n6\u00c5\n\n6\u00c5\n\n1\n\n3\n\nFigure 3.

Our result for EV = E(graphene + vacancy) \u2212 N \u22121 (N \u2212 1)E(graphene),\nN being the number of atoms in the graphene supercell, is 7.87 eV, which compares\nwell with the previous calculations[12, 20, 15] of 7.4 \u2212 7.8 eV as well as with the\nexperimental value of 7.0 \u00b1 0.5 eV.[33]\nElectronic structure \u2013 Fig. 4 shows the band structure, where the vacancy induced\nV\u03c3 and V\u03c0 states are clearly seen.

For this supercell, it can\nbe easily seen by drawing both Brillouin zones that the Dirac points K and K \u2032 of\ngraphene get folded into the \u0393 point of the supercell Brillouin zone, so that remnants\nof the Dirac bands are seen at the \u0393 point in Fig. 4 just above EF (See also Fig.\n7 for the folded graphene tight-binding \u03c0 bands for the same supercell and note the\nsimilarity between the tight-binding \u03c0 bands and the DFT bands, Fig. 4). Due to\nsymmetry, the \u03c3 and \u03c0 bands don't mix (strictly forbidden for the planar geometry,\nbut also weakened significantly if the relaxed geometry is non-planar), which leads to\nclearly identifiable vacancy-induced V\u03c3 bands. The V\u03c3 states originating from the\ndangling bonds are split due to the crystal field, Jahn-Teller, and exchange coupling\nas indicated in Fig. 2 and discussed in more detail in Section 3. The dispersion\nof the V\u03c3 bands in the band structure comes from the vacancy-vacancy interactions\nin different supercells or from the k-dependent interaction with the bonding and the\nanti-bonding \u03c3 bands, both effects being small. For non-planar relaxed structure,\nthey should have a small resonance broadening due to the interaction with the \u03c0 band\ncontinuum. Three electrons occupy these states leading to the occupation V\u03c31 \u2191\u2193,\nV\u03c32 \u2191, with the remaining fourth electron occupying the V\u03c0 \u2191 state.\nWe now turn to a description of the effect of the vacancy on the \u03c0 states.\nBasically, the vacancy introduces a sharp, resonance state V\u03c0 in the midgap region.\nThe following summarizes the discussions in Section 4, which are important to keep in\nmind here: (i) If only NN tight-binding hoppings are kept, then the vacancy introduces\na single localized state V\u03c0 at E = 0 and of zero width called the zero-mode state, and\nits wave function decays as \u223c 1/r with distance in the linear-band approximation. (ii)\nPresence of the vacancy in each supercell does not affect the energy or the width of\nthis state because of the result that the zero-mode wave function lives on the majority\nsublattice entirely and any changes in the minority sublattice does not affect it (in the\n\n\fElectronic structure of the substitutional vacancy in graphene: Density-functional and Green's function studies6\n\nSpin\u2212up\n\n4\n\nSpin\u2212down\n\nv\u03c33\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\n2\n\nv\u03c32\nv\u03c0\n\n0\nv\u03c32\n\n\u22122\n\nv\u03c31\n\n\u22124\n\n\u0393\n\nK\n\nM\n\n\u0393\n\nK\n\nM\n\nFigure 4. Spin polarized band structure of graphene with a single vacancy in a\n72-atom 6 \u00d7 6 supercell obtained from the density functional LAPW method. The\nvacancy induced V\u03c3 and V\u03c0 bands are indicated in blue and red, respectively.\nSymmetry strictly forbids the admixture between \u03c3 and \u03c0 states for a planar\nrelaxation around the vacancy, leading to flat V\u03c3 bands (blue lines). The V\u03c0\nbands are not flat owing to hybridization with the continuum \u03c0 states. The Dirac\npoints K and K \u2032 of the original graphene Brillouin zone get folded into the \u0393\npoint of the supercell Brillouin zone. The zero of energy is taken to be the Fermi\nenergy EF .\n\nsupercell, all vacancies are located on the same, minority sublattice). (iii) However,\ndue to the 2NN hopping as well as the exchange splitting, the energy of V\u03c0 is different\nfrom zero, so that it now has a small but finite width due to resonance broadening\nwith the linear \u03c0 band continuum consistent with the STM experiments.[10] (iv) In\nthe supercell calculations, the V\u03c0 state acquires an extra broadening due to the slow\n1/r decay of the V\u03c0 wave function, because of the interaction between the supercells.\nDirac point \u2013 In Fig. 4, the Dirac point occurs above the EF (see the bands just\nabove EF at the \u0393 point, to which the standard Dirac points K and K \u2032 have become\nfolded). For the truly isolated vacancy, the location of the Dirac point above EF would\nmean that an infinite number of electrons are transferred from the unfilled part of the\nDirac cones to the lone vacancy site, which is impossible. Another way of seeing this\nis to consider first an infinite lattice without the vacancy. Obviously, the EF occurs\nat the Dirac point with zero density-of-states as usual. Now, if we introduce a single\nvacancy into the structure it can only affect the position of EF by \u223c 1/N , where N is\nthe total number of atoms in the lattice, so that EF remains unchanged for the infinite\nlattice. Of course, the electron states in the local neighborhood of the vacancy are\nmodified, e. g., due to the resonance interaction with the vacancy states or due to the\nvacancy potential. The Dirac-like bands seen just above EF at \u0393 in Fig. 4 represent\nthe effect of the vacancy on the electronic structure in the local neighborhood of the\nvacancy in the supercell calculation.\n\n\fElectronic structure of the substitutional vacancy in graphene: Density-functional and Green's function studies7\n\nV\u03c31\n\n,V\u03c32\n\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\nt k\u03c0\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n\u03c0 band\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\nV\n\u03c0\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\nFigure 5. Sketch of the magnetic moment for an isolated vacancy, emphasizing\nthe spatial extent of the various electronic states. The V\u03c3 electrons are highly\nlocalized on the carbon triangle surrounding the vacancy, while the V\u03c0 electron\nis only \"quasi-localized\" with its wave function decaying only as 1/r. Hund'srule exchange aligns the V\u03c3 and V\u03c0 electrons, producing a S = 1 state with\nthe nominal magnetic moment of 2\u03bcB . This moment is however reduced by\npolarization of the \u03c0 band spins in the vicinity of the vacancy, described by an\nantiferromagnetic Kondo-like coupling tk\u03c0 between the \u03c0 bands and the localized\nV\u03c0 and V\u03c3 moments. The \u03c0 band polarization is about 0.3\u03bcB in our DFT\ncalculations, leading to the net magnetic moment of 1.7\u03bcB .\n\nMagnetic moment \u2013 The vacancy magnetic moment consists of two parts as shown\nschematically in Fig. 5: (i) the localized moment coming from the vacancy states V\u03c0\nand V\u03c3 and (ii) the induced moment on the band electrons in the vicinity of the\nvacancy. One can argue on general grounds that the first contribution should be 2\u03bcB\n(S = 1), while the second contribution should reduce this value somewhat due to the\nantiferromagnetic Kondo-like coupling between the localized and the itinerant band\nspins. Turning to the localized states, the vacancy leaves four electrons to be occupied\namong the V\u03c3 dangling bond states and the V\u03c0 zero-mode state. Of these, three\nelectrons will occupy the V\u03c3 states, so that one electron resides on each of the three\ndangling bonds of the carbon triangle. The Coulomb interaction U would prevent the\noccupation of a fourth V\u03c3 state, so that the remaining electron is energetically favored\nto occupy the \u03c0 states. The Hund's coupling between the V\u03c3 and V\u03c0 electrons leads\nthen to a S = 1 state with a magnetic moment of 2\u03bcB . This basic picture is illustrated\nin Figs. 2 and 5 and it is fully supported by the DFT bands, Fig. 4. This localized\nmagnetic moment of 2\u03bcB is reduced due to the spin-polarization of the \u03c0 bands in the\nvicinity of the vacancy.\nThe spin polarization of the \u03c0 bands can occur due to two factors: (i) the\nresonance coupling with the V\u03c0 \u2191 electron with the \u03c0 continuum bands and (ii) the\nKondo-like antiferromagnetic interaction between the localized vacancy states and the\ncontinuum \u03c0 states. The first is not well described in a supercell calculation due to\nthe long-range nature of the V\u03c0 state and the second effect is intrinsically not well\ndescribed within the band theory.\nOur DFT calculations yield a magnetic moment of about 1.7\u03bcB . This can be\nseen by estimating the number of holes in the small hole pocket in the two bands\njust above EF at the \u0393 point in the spin-up bands of Fig. 4. The spin-down bands\nmust contain exactly the same number of extra electrons missing from the spin-up\nbands. Without this pocket of holes, which represents the band polarization in the\nimmediate neighborhood of the vacancy, the magnetic moment would be exactly 2\u03bcB ,\n\n\fElectronic structure of the substitutional vacancy in graphene: Density-functional and Green's function studies8\ncorresponding to the full occupancy of V\u03c31 \u2191\u2193, V\u03c32 \u2191, and V\u03c0 \u2191. The existence of the\nhole pocket reduces this number. We can estimate the number n in the hole pocket\nby computing the total area of the two hole Fermi surfaces and comparing it to the\narea of the supercell Brillouin zone, which yields the value n \u2248 0.15. Since the same\nnumber of electrons must be accommodated in the spin down bands, this would cause\na net reduction of N\u2191 \u2212 N\u2193 by 0.30 leading to a net magnetic moment of 1.7\u03bcB .\nIn the literature, the calculated magnetic moment varies widely, anywhere\nbetween 1.04 \u2212 1.84\u03bcB [13, 19, 18, 12, 20, 15, 14, 16, 21, 22, 17, 23, 24]. Typically,\nthe lower values come from calculations, where the V\u03c0 \u2191 and V\u03c0 \u2193 bands overlap\nsignificantly. We suggest that the variation of the calculated magnetic moment in the\nliterature is due to the intrinsic deficiency of the supercell method in estimating the\n\u03c0 magnetic moment due to the slow 1/r decay of the V\u03c0 state, which produces an\nextra broadening of the V\u03c0 state due to the supercell interaction and does not take\ninto account the full anti-ferromagnetic polarization of the itinerant \u03c0 band states.\nThe exchange splitting \u2206 of the V\u03c0 state is due to its overlap with the V\u03c3 states\nwhich are localized on the three carbon atoms adjacent to the vacancy. It may be\nestimated from the expression\n\u2206 \u2261 E(V \u03c0\u2193 ) \u2212 E(V \u03c0\u2191 ) \u2248 JH \u00d7 |\u03a80 |2 \u2248 0.35 eV,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the Hund's-rule energy is typically JH \u223c 0.9 \u2212 1.0 eV for the atoms and\n|\u03a80 |2 \u223c 0.4 is the combined total density of the V\u03c0 state on the carbon triangle\nas obtained from the DFT results. The estimated exchange splitting is in agreement\nwith the splitting seen in the DFT bands, Fig. 4.\nRelation to the Lieb's Theorem \u2013 The Lieb's theorem[34] states that for the\nrepulsive one-band Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice and half-filled band, the\nground state has spin S = (1/2)|NB \u2212 NA |, NA (NB ) being the number of sites on\nthe two sublattices. It is important to point out that the theorem holds if we consider\nonly the \u03c0-band system and also neglect the small second-neighbor interactions that\ncouples the two sublattices. Thus, with a single vacancy present, |NB \u2212 NA | = 1 so\nthat according to the Lieb's Theorem we should have a net spin of S = 1/2. However,\nin addition to the \u03c0, we also have the \u03c3 electrons. The Lieb result of S = 1/2 for\nthe \u03c0 electrons is now coupled to the spins of the three \u03c3 electrons localized near the\nvacancy, leading to the net spin S = 1 as indicated in the summary figure, Fig. 1. We\nhave already argued that the magnetic moment of 2\u03bcB corresponding to S = 1 will\nbe reduced due to the polarization of the band electrons in the local neighborhood of\nthe vacancy.\n3. Vacancy-induced V\u03c3 states\nThe essential features of the density-functional results may be understood by simple\ntight-binding considerations of the effect of the vacancy on the \u03c3 and the \u03c0 bands.\nWe study the \u03c3 states in this section followed by the \u03c0 states in the next section.\nThe description of the vacancy-induced V \u03c3 states for graphene is rather simple.\nIn graphene, the sp2 \u03c3 states are removed away from EF due to strong interaction\nwith neighbouring orbitals along the C-C bonds. However, with a vacancy present,\nthe three sp2 \u03c3 orbitals of the three NN carbon atoms with their lobes pointed towards\nthe vacancy have their usual bonding partners missing, so that they occur near EF ,\nwith their on-site energies \u01eb\u03c3 slightly below the \u03c0 orbital energies because of the s\norbital component present in the \u03c3 states.\n\n\fElectronic structure of the substitutional vacancy in graphene: Density-functional and Green's function studies9\nThe crystal-field splitting however will lift the three-fold degeneracy. The main\nfeature can be described by taking into account the 2NN hopping T between the three\ndangling bonds in the undistorted triangle, leading to the 3 \u00d7 3 Hamiltonian:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u01eb\u03c3 \u2212T \u2212T\nHcf = \uf8ed \u2212T \u01eb\u03c3 \u2212T \uf8f8 ,\n(2)\n\u2212T \u2212T \u01eb\u03c3\n\ndiagonalization of which yields a double degenerate state at E = T and a single\ndegenerate state at E = \u22122T as shown in Fig. 2, where we call this splitting the\ncrystal-field splitting. The Jahn-Teller distortion of the triangle splits the double\ndegenerate state further, which is described by the unequal hopping T 6= T \u2032 .\nTaking the isosceles-triangle relaxation found in our DFT results, two of the three\nhopping terms are modified into T \u2032 as indicated in Fig. 6. From the DFT band\n\u2032\nstructure, we find that\n\u221a T \u2248 1.6 eV, while T \u2248 1.2 eV. The new eigenstates are:\n\u22121\n\u20322\n2\n) and E\u03c33 = T with the corresponding (unnormalized)\nE\u03c31 ,\u03c32 = 2 (\u2212T \u2213 8T + T \u221a\nwave functions \u03a81,2 = ((\u2212T \u00b1 8T \u20322 + T 2 )/T \u2032 , 1, 1) and \u03a83 = (0, \u22121, 1). This simple\nmodel suggests a Jahn-Teller distortion of the carbon triangle surrounding the vacancy.\nThe Jahn-Teller interaction is of the type E \u2297 e (both electronic and vibrational\nstates are doubly degenerate) in a trigonal (D3h ) symmetry. With this lattice\ndistortion, the trigonal symmetry is broken. The distortion removes the double\ndegeneracy and the two \u221a\nstates (shown in Fig. 2 as V \u03c32 and V \u03c33 ) are now split\nby the amount 2\u22121 (3T \u2212 8T \u20322 + T 2 ) \u2248 4(T \u2212 T \u2032 )/3 \u2248 0.55 eV. Since there are only\nthree electrons available to the V\u03c3 states, V \u03c31 is occupied with two electrons, while\nthe lone remaining electron occupies the V \u03c32 state. The spin-degeneracy is removed\nby the Hund's coupling with the electron occupying the V\u03c0 state, producing the spin\nstructure indicated in Fig. 2. The wave function \u03a82 corresponding to the V \u03c32 state\nshows that the maximum weight (\u223c 66%) comes from the sp2 \u03c3 dangling orbital of the\napical atom of the carbon triangle, which is consistent with the spin density plotted\nin Fig. 6. The Jahn-Teller distortion is actually dynamic, with the carbon triangle\ntunneling between three equivalent minima on the adiabatic potential surface of the\nE \u2297 e Jahn-Teller problem, an issue we discuss elsewhere.[35]\n4. Vacancy-induced V\u03c0 states\nIn this Section, we discuss the origin of the localized state \u2013 the so-called \"zeromode\" state \u2013 near the band center of the \u03c0 bands. Understanding of the origin\nand the \"quasi-localized\" nature of the zero-mode state is an essential part of the\ninterpretation of the full band calculation using the density-functional theory.\nIf only the NN interactions are present, the \"zero-mode\" state is a localized state\nwith energy exactly at the band center. If in addition the higher-neighbour interactions\nare also present but not too large, as is the case for graphene,[29] then the localized\nstate turns into a sharply-peaked resonance state owing to its overlap with the \u03c0 bands\nand occurs not too far from the band center.\n4.1. The existence of the zero mode state\nAccording to the zero-mode theorem,[25] which is in fact valid for any bipartite lattice\nwith NN interactions, whenever there is an imbalance in the number of atoms in the\ntwo sublattices in a bipartite lattice, viz., n = NB \u2212 NA > 0, there are n number\n\n\fElectronic structure of the substitutional vacancy in graphene: Density-functional and Green's function studies10\n\ny\n\n\u2212T'\n\n\u2212T'\n\nx\n\n\u2212T\n\nFigure 6.

Green (blue) circles indicate\npositive (negative) values, with the area of the circle being proportional to the spin\ndensity. The spin moments on the carbon atoms other than the vacancy triangle\nare due to the \u03c0 electrons, which are long-ranged due to the slow 1/r decay of\nthe V\u03c0 state. The hopping integrals T and T \u2032 between the sp2 \u03c3 orbitals on the\ncarbon triangle adjacent to the vacancy has reference to the model discussed in\nSection 3.\n\nof degenerate solutions with the eigenvalue \u01ebB (the on-site energy of the majority\nsublattice), with the wave functions residing entirely on this sublattice. This can be\nseen from the following simple considerations as an alternative to Pereira et al.'s proof\nwhich used the rank-nullity theorem in linear algebra.[25]\nWe begin with the conjecture that there are some solutions where the wave\nfunctions live completely on the majority sublattice (B) and proceed to find them.\nThus we have\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nHBB HBA\n\u03a8B\n\u03a8B\n=E\n,\n(3)\n\u2020\n0\n0\nHBA\nHAA\nwhere \u03a8B is a vector in the B sublattice of dimension NB and there is null contribution\nfrom the A sublattice to the wave function. It will be clear from the following\ndiscussion that for the theorem to hold, the B sublattice NB \u00d7 NB Hamiltonian is\nrestricted to the diagonal form\nHBB = \u01ebB I,\n\n(4)\n\nHBB \u03a8B = E\u03a8B\n\n(5)\n\nand there are no restrictions on the remaining parts of the Hamiltonian. The specific\nform of HBB means that there is no site disorder, nor is there any interactions between\nthe atoms on the B sublattice (hence it will fail if interactions beyond the NN are\npresent, which will produce a non-diagonal HBB ). However, such restrictions need\nnot apply to the A sublattice, so that the NA \u00d7 NA Hamiltonian HAA for the minority\nsublattice can have diagonal disorder and also there is no restriction on the form of\nHBA as well. This means that the A sublattice atoms can interact between themselves\nand with the B sublattice atoms as well without invalidating the theorem.\nThe wave function \u03a8B thus satisfies\n\u2020\nHBA\n\u03a8B\n\n= 0.\n\n(6)\n\nThe first of these equations tells us that if the conjectured solutions of the form\n(\u03a8B , 0) exist, then they must have the enegy E = \u01ebB and there would be at most NB\n\n\fElectronic structure of the substitutional vacancy in graphene: Density-functional and Green's function studies11\nnumber of such degenerate solutions; the equation does not place any constraints on\nthe individual components of \u03a8B .\nTurning to Eq. 6, there are NB components of \u03a8B to be determined but only\nNA < NB equations are there to determine them. This means that the solutions\ncan not be fully determined. However if we specify NB \u2212 NA components of \u03a8B ,\nthen the remaining components are uniquely determined as linear functions of these\ncomponents. These solutions are therefore of the form\n\u03a8B = (\u03c61 , \u03c62 , ..., \u03c6NB \u2212NA ; f1 , f2 , ..., fNA ),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere we can choose\nthe \u03c6i 's arbitrarily and the fi 's are then just linear combinations\nPNB \u2212N\nA\nof \u03c6i 's (fi =\ncij \u03c6j , where the expansion coefficients are determined by\nj=1\n\n\u2020\nHBA\nin Eq. 6). Thus the number of linearly independent solutions is given by\nthe number of ways we can choose linearly independent solutions in the subspace\n(\u03c61 , \u03c62 , ..., \u03c6NB \u2212NA ), which is clearly NB \u2212 NA . This proves the conjecture and the\ntheorem.\nIt is easy to see why the theorem is not valid if there is on-site disorder on the\nmajority sublattice or interactions beyond the NN, which introduces off diagonal terms\nin HBB . So, Eq. 4 is not true anymore. This means that Eq. 5 puts constraints on the\ncomponents of \u03a8B in order to satisfy the eigenvalue problem and as a result Eqs. 5 and\n6 can not both be satisfied simultaneously. For example, if we use the form Eq. 7 which\nsatisfies Eq. 6, we are only left with the freedom to choose \u03c61 , \u03c62 , ..., \u03c6NB \u2212NA and this\nis not enough to satisfy the eigenvalue problem of Eq. 5. There is no such problem\nif HBB = \u03b5B I , since any vector (\u03c61 , \u03c62 , ..., \u03c6NB \u2212NA ; f1 , f2 , ..., fNA ) is a solution with\nE = \u03b5B .\nThe theorem has an important bearing on the results of the supercell calculations,\nboth tight-binding and density functional. In these calculations, the vacancies are\nrepeated in each supercell, connected by the superlattice translational vectors, and\nhence are all located on the same sublattice, which forms the minority sublattice. If\nn is the number of supercells in the crystal, then this is also the imbalance in the\nnumber of atoms in the two sublattices n = NB \u2212 NA . According to the theorem,\nthere should be n zero-modes in the Brillouin zone, which is also precisely the number\nof Bloch momentum points in the Brillouin zone. These states thus show up in the\nform of a dispersionless band in the tight-binding supercell calculations at E = 0.\nIf hopping beyond the NN is present or if the on-site energies of the different\natoms are different, then the theorem does not hold. However, the hopping beyond\nthe NN in graphene is small[29] and the on-site energies are negligibly different on sites\nclose to the vacancy as obtained from the DFT calculations. Because these effects are\nsmall, a clearly identifiable, nearly-dispersionless zero-mode band is found in the DFT\ncalculations as seen from Fig. 4 as well as in the higher-neighbour tight-binding results\n[Fig. 7], where the zero-mode band is marked by the red dots.\n\n4.2. Tight-binding results: Direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian\nIn order to further understand the formation of the zero-mode states, we have\nstudied the vacancy \u03c0 bands with the standard tight-binding model of the pz\norbitals containing both the nearest neighbour (NN) and the second- neighbour (2NN)\ninteractions. In particular, we look for the vacancy-induced zero-mode states discussed\nin the previous Subsection.\n\n\fElectronic structure of the substitutional vacancy in graphene: Density-functional and Green's function studies12\nt=2.84 eV, t'=0 eV\n\nt=2.84 eV, t'=0 eV\n\nt=2.84 eV, t'=0.2 eV\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-2\n\n-2\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\nNA\nN B\u2212NA\nNA\n-4\n\n-4\n\u0393\n\nK\n\nM\n\n-4\n\u0393\n\nK\n\nM\n\n\u0393\n\nK\n\nM\n\nFigure 7.

The sublattice with the vacancy atoms is labelled A\nand the total number of states in different bands (not counting spin degeneracy)\nis shown on the right, with NA and NB denoting the total number of atoms in\nthe two sublattices in the entire crystal.\n\nThe tight-binding Hamiltonian is\nX \u2020\nX \u2020\nci\u03c3 cj\u03c3 + H.c.,\nci\u03c3 cj\u03c3 + t\u2032\nHT B = \u2212t\nhiji\u03c3\n\n(8)\n\nhhijii\u03c3\n\nwhere \u2212t and t\u2032 are the NN and the 2NN interactions with the signs chosen such that\nt, t\u2032 > 0 (t \u2248 2.91 eV and t\u2032 \u2248 0.16 eV for graphene[29]).\nThe band structures and the densities-of-states are shown in Figs. 7 and 8. The\nelectron counting in the band structure Fig. 7 is as follows. Both the lower and the\nupper bands contain in total (integrated over the Brillouin zone) NA states each, while\nthe zero-mode band contains NB \u2212 NA states, making a total of NA + NB states, as\nit must be the case. We have one \u03c0 electron per site present in the system, so that\ntaking spin into account, the entire lower subband is full, while the zero-mode states\nare half full. For the single vacancy (NB \u2212 NA = 1), this leads to a single occupied\nelectron in the zero-mode states, resulting in S = 1/2 in agreement with the Lieb's\nTheorem[34].\nAs discussed in the previous Section, if only the NN interactions are present, we\nshould have NB \u2212 NA number of zero-mode states at E = 0 exactly. This is why\nthe zero-mode band in the middle panel of Fig. 7 is completely flat. However, if the\n2NN interactions are also present, then the energies of the zero-mode states are not\nguaranteed to be the same and we see a spread in the energy of these states, which\n\n\fElectronic structure of the substitutional vacancy in graphene: Density-functional and Green's function studies13\n\nDOS (states/eV/cell)\n\nt=2.84 eV, t'=0 eV\n\nt=2.84 eV, t'=0.20 eV\n\n60\n\n60\n\n40\n\nZero mode state\n40\n\n20\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n-8\n\n-4\n\n0\nE (eV)\n\n4\n\n8\n\n-8\n\n-4\n\n0\nE (eV)\n\n4\n\n8\n\nFigure 8.

In a real material, however, U0\nis large but finite. The effect of a finite U0 is that (a) It causes the zero-mode state\nto occur slightly below the mid-gap (E = 0) and (b) The sharp zero-mode state turns\ninto a resonance state due to interaction with the continuum \u03c0 bands. This is best\ndescribed with the Green's function approach discussed in the next Subsection.\n4.3. Impurity Green's Function and the zero-mode state in the \u03c0 bands\nIn this Section, we study the effect of a single impurity on the \u03c0 electron states by\nstudying the Dyson's equation and show the emergence of the zero-mode state as the\nstrength of the impurity potential U0 is gradually increased. For the vacancy, this\npotential is large but finite, so that the results obtained in this Section are helpful in\nunderstanding the nature of the zero-mode state in the actual structure with a finite\nvacancy potential.\nThe wave function of the zero-mode state is obtained from the LippmannSchwinger equation. Consistent with the previous results,[25, 36] we find that (a)\nThe zero-mode state consists of wave functions from the majority sublattice only and\n(b) It is quasi-localized decaying as 1/r as a function of distance from the vacancy in\nthe limit of the linear-band approximation. In addition to these known results, our\nanalysis allows us to (a) obtain the oscillatory phase factors in the zero-mode wave\nfunction due to the interference of the two Dirac points and (b) compare the lineardispersion results with the full tight-binding band result by computing the GFs for\nlarge distances in both cases.\nThe vacancy is modeled by adding an on-site perturbation V to the unperturbed\nNN (NN) tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonian, so that\nH = H0 + V,\nP \u2020\nwhere H0 = \u2212t ci\u03b1 cj\u03b2 + H.c., i\u03b1 being the site-sublattice index, and\nV = U0 c\u20200A c0A ,\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\n\fElectronic structure of the substitutional vacancy in graphene: Density-functional and Green's function studies14\nF0 (E)\n\n\u03c10 (E)\n\nG00A,0A (E)\n\n0.5\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n1\nU0\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n-4\n\nEF\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n2\n\n4\n\nE/t\nFigure 9.

Change in the total sublattice DOS due to the addition of the\nimpurity with U0 = 5t as computed from the factors multiplying the coefficient\n\"1/N \" in Eqs. 17 and 18. The emergence of the zero-mode state on the B\nsublattice at E = 0 is clearly seen, which grows into a \u03b4 function as U0 \u2192 \u221e.\nThe remaining changes in the DOS go to zero as 1/N , except for the (unimportant)\nbound state on the A sublattice (occurring at E/t \u223c 6 in the top figure), which\nbecomes a \u03b4-function bound state with E \u2192 \u221e in the limit of U0 \u2192 \u221e.\n\nwhere U0 is the strength of the potential due to the impurity on the A-sublattice in\nthe central cell. The vacancy corresponds to the value of U0 \u2192 \u221e.\nThe key quantity of interest here is the unperturbed GF, G0 (E) = (E+i\u03b7\u2212H0 )\u22121 ,\n\n\fElectronic structure of the substitutional vacancy in graphene: Density-functional and Green's function studies15\nthe calculation of which we have discussed in our earlier paper where we studied the\nRKKY interaction in graphene.[37] As usual, the imaginary part of the GF contains\nthe information about the density-of-states: \u03c10 (E) = \u2212\u03c0 \u22121 Im G0 (E). The GF G(E)\nin the presence of the perturbation will be obtained from the Dyson's equation.\nSince we will be interested in the local density-of-states (LDOS) on the various\ncarbon sites and how they are modified by the presence of the impurity, we will need\nto calculate the real-space matrix elements G0i\u03b1,j\u03b2 (E) \u2261 hi\u03b1|G0 (E)|j\u03b2i. This may\nbe done by going to the momentum space and defining the Bloch functions for the\nP ~\n~ i + ~\u03c4\u03b1 being the position vector\nelectrons |~k\u03b1i = N \u22121/2 i eik.~ri\u03b1 |i\u03b1i with ~ri\u03b1 = R\nof the \u03b1-th atom in the i-th unit cell. !The unperturbed Hamiltonian H0 in this\n0\nf (~k)\n~ ~\n~ ~\n~ ~\nbasis set becomes H~k =\n, where f (~k) = \u2212t (eik*d1 + eik*d2 + eik*d3 )\n\u2217 ~\nf (k)\n0\nand d~1 , d~2 , and d~3 are the positions of the three nearest neighbors. Diagonalization\nof the Hamiltonian yields the eigenenergies E(~k) = \u00b1|f (~k)|, which when expanded\naround the Dirac points lead to the usual linear band structure E(~q) = \u00b1vF |~q|, where\n~ D is the deviation from the Dirac point in the Brillouin zone. Here the\n~q = ~k \u2212 K\nFermi velocity vF = 3ta/2, where 'a' is the carbon-carbon bond length. Note that\nunlike our previous work,[37] vF here is defined to be a positive quantity, since 't' is\npositive.\nThe real-space GFs are conveniently obtained by first calculating the momentumspace GF, which can be easily shown to be G0 (~kE) \u2261 h~k\u03b1|G0 (E)|~k\u03b2i = (E + i\u03b7 +\nH~k )((E+i\u03b7)2 \u2212|f (~k)|2 )\u22121 . A Fourier transform then yields the real-space unperturbed\nGF, viz.,\n1 X i~k*(~ri\u03b1 \u2212~rj\u03b2 ) 0 ~\nG0i\u03b1,j\u03b2 (E) =\ne\nG\u03b1\u03b2 (kE),\n(11)\nN\n~\nk\n\nwhich can be calculated by simply a brute-force summation over the Brillouin\nzone. It can also be computed by a second method using the Horiguchi recursive\ntechnique.[38, 37] However, the latter, although computationally fast, has convergence\n~i \u2212 R\n~ j | \u2265 7a or so, so that this is a better method to use\nproblems[39] for distances |R\nonly for smaller distances.\nThe perturbed GF is related to the unperturbed GF through the Dyson's\nequation: G = G0 + G0 V G. Using the localized form of the impurity potential,\nEq. 10, and taking the matrix elements, we immediately get for the real-space GF,\nthe result\nGi\u03b1,j\u03b2 (E) = G0i\u03b1,j\u03b2 (E) + U0 \u00d7 G0i\u03b1,0A (E)G0A,j\u03b2 (E).\n(12)\nWe are specifically interested in the on-site GFs with \u03b1 = \u03b2 and Ri = Rj , which\ngive the LDOS on the A and B sites at distance ri\u03b1 = Ri + \u03c4\u03b1 from the impurity site.\nEq. (12) is easily inverted to yield the perturbed G(E) in terms of the unperturbed\nG0 (E), viz.,\nGi\u03b1,i\u03b1 (E) = G0i\u03b1,i\u03b1 (E) +\n\nU0 G0i\u03b1,0A (E)G00A,i\u03b1 (E)\n.\n1 \u2212 U0 G00A,0A (E)\n\n(13)\n\nThe LDOS at different sites may be obtained by taking the imaginary parts of\nthe diagonal elements of the GF: \u03c1i\u03b1 (E) = \u2212\u03c0 \u22121 Im Gi\u03b1,i\u03b1 (E). It immediately follows\nfrom Eq. 13 that the LDOS at the impurity site has the much simpler form\n\u03c10 (E)\n\u03c10A (E) =\n,\n(14)\n(1 \u2212 U0 F0 (E))2 + (\u03c0U0 \u03c10 (E))2\n\n\fElectronic structure of the substitutional vacancy in graphene: Density-functional and Green's function studies16\nwhere \u03c10 (E) = \u2212\u03c0 \u22121 Im G00A,0A (E) is the unperturbed LDOS at the central site,\nwhich is of course the same for every site in unperturbed graphene, and F0 (E) =\nRe G00A,0A (E). Note that we have defined here \u03c10 (E) to be the unperturbed densityof-state per sublattice per spin (which is independent of the sublattice or the cell\nindex) and \u03c1i\u03b1 (E) is the corresponding perturbed quantity for the i\u03b1 site.\nThe resonance condition follows from Eq. 14, viz.,\n1 \u2212 U0 F0 (E0 ) = 0,\n(15)\nwhere E0 is the resonance energy. The graphical solution of this equation is shown in\nFig. 9. There are four solutions for E0 : The two solutions at E0 = \u00b1t do not produce\nmuch change in the DOS, as may be inferred from Eq. 14, due to the diverging\ndensity-of-states \u03c10 (E) there, and the bound state with E0 \u2192 U0 for large U0 is\ninconsequential because it is removed to \u221e, which then leaves the sole resonance state\nindicated by the black dot in Fig. 9. Its energy goes to zero in the limit U0 \u2192 \u221e and\nthe oscillator strength to one, producing the zero-mode state for the vacancy.\nThe total DOS in the presence of the perturbation mayPbe computed by taking the\ntrace of Eq. (13) for the entire lattice. Using the identity i\u03b1 G0i\u03b1,0A (E)G00A,i\u03b1 (E) =\n\u2212dG00A,0A (E)/dE and some tedious algebra, the result is\n\u2212U0 [U0 \u03c10 (E)F0\u2032 (E) + \u03c1\u20320 (E)(1 \u2212 U0 F0 (E))]\n1\n.\n(16)\n\u00d7\nN\n(1 \u2212 U0 F0 (E))2 + (\u03c0U0 \u03c10 (E))2\nSimilarly, by taking the trace of Eq. (13) over the cell index only, the individual\nsublattice DOS may be found, which for the A sublattice reads as\n1\n\u2212U0 [(1 \u2212 U0 F 0 (E)) Im\u03be(E) \u2212 \u03c0U0 \u03c10 (E) Re\u03be(E)]\n\u03c1A (E) = \u03c10 (E) +\n\u00d7\n,\n(17)\nN\n\u03c0[(1 \u2212 U0 F0 (E))2 + (\u03c0U0 \u03c10 (E))2 ]\nP\nwhere \u03be(E) = (1/N ) k [G0AA (kE)]2 and the densities of states are, again, per\nsublattice and per spin. A similar expression for \u03c1B (E) reads\n1\n\u03c1B (E) = \u03c10 (E) +\nN\n\u2212U0 [(1 \u2212 U0 F 0 (E))(\u03c0\u03c1\u20320 (E) \u2212 Im\u03be(E)) + \u03c0U0 \u03c10 (E)(F0\u2032 (E) + Re\u03be(E))]\n.(18)\n\u00d7\n\u03c0[(1 \u2212 U0 F0 (E))2 + (\u03c0U0 \u03c10 (E))2 ]\nIt can be verified from Eqs. (16) - (18) that \u03c1tot (E) = \u03c1A (E) + \u03c1B (E), so that these\nequations are consistent.\nThe numerical results are summarized in Figs. 10, 11, and 12. The factors\nmultiplying the 1/N in Eqs. 17 and 18 are the changes in the DOS \u2206\u03c1A (E) and\n\u2206\u03c1B (E) introduced by the impurity potential, which are shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 11\nshows the emergence of the zero-mode in the density-of-states with E = 0 and that\nthis state resides entirely on the B sublattice in the limit U0 \u2192 \u221e. Fig. 12 shows the\nLDOS on the impurity site (\u03c10A ) and on the nearest (\u03c10B ) and the next nearest sites\n(\u03c11A ).\nThe width of the resonance peak increases with the resonance energy E0 . Keeping\nthe linear term in the expansion of F0 (E), viz., F0 (E) \u2248 U0\u22121 + F0\u2032 (E0 )(E \u2212 E0 ), Eq.\n(16) yields the Lorenzian lineshape\n1\n\u0393\n\u03c1tot (E) \u2248 2\u03c10 (E) +\n,\n(19)\n\u03c0N (E \u2212 E0 )2 + \u03932\nwhere the resonance width is given by\n\u0393 = \u2212\u03c0\u03c10 (E0 )/F0\u2032 (E0 ).\n(20)\nThe width is zero if E0 = 0 and increases with energy as shown in Fig. (13).\n\u03c1tot (E) = 2\u03c10 (E) +\n\n\fElectronic structure of the substitutional vacancy in graphene: Density-functional and Green's function studies17\n\n\u03c1A (E)\n\n0.4\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n0.2\n\n0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nE/t\n\n\u03c1B (E)\n\n0.4\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n0.2\n\n0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\nE/t\nFigure 11.\nTotal density-of-states for the A sublattice \u03c1A (E) (top) and\nthe B sublattice \u03c1B (E) (bottom) for different values of the impurity potential\nU0 /t = 0, 2, and 5, denoted by the black dashed, black solid, and red dashed lines\nrespectively. These results are obtained from Eqs. 17 and 18 by using N = 20 for\nthe purpose of plotting. The figure shows the evolution of the zero-mode state at\nE = 0, which lives completely on the B sublattice in the limit of U0 \u2192 \u221e, i.e.,\nopposite to the sublattice in which the vacancy is introduced.\n\n4.4. Impurity state wave function\nIn this section, we study the impurity state V\u03c0 wave function from the LippmannSchwinger equation. The analysis allows us to obtain the well known 1/r decay of\nthe vacancy state; however, in addition we also obtain the oscillatory behavior of the\nwave function due to the interference between the two Dirac cones.\nOur starting point is the Lippmann-Schwinger equation |\u03a8i = |\u03a80 i + G0 V |\u03a8i,\nwhere |\u03a80 i is the unperturbed state. For the localized impurity potential on the\ncentral A site, V = U0 |0Aih0A|, the Lippmann-Schwinger equation leads to the wave\nfunction\nU0 G0i\u03b1,0A (E)\u03a800A\n.\n(21)\n\u03a8i\u03b1 \u2261 hi\u03b1|\u03a8i = \u03a80i\u03b1 +\n1 \u2212 U0 G00A,0A (E)\nWe are interested in the low-energy behavior, since that's the region where the\nresonance state gets introduced by the impurity as seen from Fig. 9. The GFs for the\nfull tight-binding band structure as well as for the linear bands were computed in our\nprevious work.[37] For the linear bands and in the low energy limit, the results are\nG0iA,0A (E) = \u2212 \u03b2\n\nAc E\n\u2212iEr\n),\nK0 (\n2\n2\u03c0vF\nvF\n\n\fElectronic structure of the substitutional vacancy in graphene: Density-functional and Green's function studies18\n\n\u03c10A (E)\n\n0.4\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n0.2\n\n0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nE/t\n\n\u03c10B (E)\n\n0.4\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n0.2\n\n0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\nE/t\n\n\u03c11A (E)\n\n0.4\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n0.2\n\n0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\nE/t\nFigure 12.

As U0 \u2192 \u221e, the\ntop LDOS goes to zero (except for the bound state beyond the top of the band\nwhose energy goes to \u221e), and the zero-mode state lives only on the B sublattice,\nas indicated from the middle and the bottom panels.

Certain elements must\nexactly agree at low energies, for example, the imaginary part of G00A,0A , which yields\nthe density-of-states, since at low energies, it is controlled by the Fermi velocity vF\nalone. We nevertheless find that the expressions Eq. 25 do agree quite well with\nthe tight-binding GFs, the agreement becoming better with increasing distances. A\ncomparison between the low-energy GFs Eq. 25 and the full GFs for a typical case is\nshown in Fig. 14, which also illustrates the symmetry of the GFs. A notable exception\nis the real part of the on-site GF G00A,0A (E), where the substitution of r = 0 in Eq. 25\nyields a divergent result. However, we find that the tight-binding GF in this case can\nbe fitted to the expression Eq. 25 for G00A,0A (E), provided we use the value r \u2248 0.6 a\ninstead of r = 0.\nWe note that the symmetry properties of the above GFs Eq. 25 are consistent\nwith the results[38] that follow from the particle-hole symmetry and valid for all\nG0iB,0A (E) =\n\n\fElectronic structure of the substitutional vacancy in graphene: Density-functional and Green's function studies20\n\nRe\nIm\n\nG0iA,0A (E)\n\n0.4\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n0.2\n\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e7 \u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00ed\u00ed\n\u00ed\u00ed \u00e7\n\u00ed\u00ed \u00ed\n\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n2\n\n4\n\nE/t\n\nG0iB,0A (E)\n\n1\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n0.5\n\u00e7\u00e7\u00e7\n\u00e7\u00e7\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00ed\n\u00ed\u00ed \u00ed\u00ed\u00ed\u00ed\n\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\nE/t\nFigure 14.

The symmetry\nproperties are illustrated for specific cases in Fig. 14.\nThe nature of the impurity state immediately follows from the LippmannSchwinger expression Eq. 21. First of all, notice an important point from the\nexpression for the GF Eq. 25, viz., that all GFs vanish at E = 0 except for the\nreal part of G0iB,0A , which is finite and decays as 1/r. This is precisely what leads to\nthe property that the zero-mode state resides on the majority sublattice B only and\nits wave function decays inversely with distance. These features are true if only the\nNN interactions are present on the graphene lattice. If second NN interactions are\npresent, then there is no electron-hole symmetry and the behavior of the GFs near\nthe resonance energy differs from Eq. 25. The form of the GFs for the latter case is\nsuch that both sublattices contribute to the resonance state near E = 0, an issue that\nis discussed in detail elsewhere.[41]\nReturning to the Lippmann-Schwinger equation Eq. 21 and inserting into it the\nlow-energy expansion for the GFs (Eq. 25) and then taking the limit of the resonance\nenergy E0 = 0, it can be easily seen that as E0 \u2192 0 in the limit U0 \u2192 \u221e, the impurity\n\n\fElectronic structure of the substitutional vacancy in graphene: Density-functional and Green's function studies21\nZigzag Direction\n\u00e7\n\n|\u03a8|2\n\n10\u22122\n\n\u00e7\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\u00e7 \u00e7\n\u00e7 \u00e7\u00e7\n\n10-4\n10-6\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nR/a\nArmchair Direction\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\n10-2\n\n|\u03a8|2\n\n\u00e7\n\n10\n\n\u00e7\n\n-3\n\n10-4\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nR/a\nFigure 15.

The long-range nature\n1/r of the wave function (28) is well-known,[36] but the oscillatory factor due to the\ninterference effect of the two Dirac points is new. The same kind of interference is also\npresent in the oscillations of the RKKY interactions.[42, 37] The wave function is not\nsquare integrable because we used the linear band structure, but it will be if we take\nthe full band structure into account. Eq. 28 nevertheless describes the gross features\nof the zero-mode state. The wave function changes sign along different directions, e.\ng., it changes sign along the zigzag direction but not along the armchair direction. The\nkinetic energy gained by the delocalization of the wave function is exactly cancelled by\nanti-bonding components present in the wave function, so that its energy still equals\nthe on-site energy in spite of the delocalization. The calculated wave function for the\nzero-mode state is shown in Fig. 15. We note that a recent study has shown that the\n1/r decay of the vacancy state remains unchanged even when a repulsive Coulomb\ninteraction is included in the tight-binding Hamiltonian.[43]\n5. Summary\nIn summary, we have studied the electronic structure of graphene with a single\nsubstitutional vacancy from density-functional calculations using the all-electron\nLAPW method and interpreted the results with the help of the tight-binding model\nand the impurity Green's Function approach. We find that the vacancy induces four\nlocalized states, viz., three V\u03c3 dangling bond states on the carbon triangle and one\nV\u03c0 resonance state. The dangling bond states cause a Jahn-Teller distortion, which\nwe found to be a planar distortion of the carbon triangle. Hund's coupling between\nthese electrons would then produce the S = 1 state at the vacancy center as indicated\nin the summary figure Fig. 1. The magnetic moment has two components: (i) The\ncomponent 2\u03bcB coming from the localized vacancy states V\u03c3 and V\u03c0 and (ii) An\nopposite component of several tenths of \u03bcB coming from the spin-polarization of the\ncontinuum \u03c0 band states in the vicinity of the vacancy. The second part is not\nwell described in the supercell band calculations due to the slow 1/r decay of the\n\"quasi-localized\" V\u03c0 wave function. This long-range decay also means that in an\nexperimental sample it is only for the extremely low vacancy concentration that the\ntruly isolated vacancy limit is reached and as a result the magnetic moment is expected\nto be dependent on the vacancy concentration.\nIn addition to the density-functional calculations, we also studied the formation\nof the V\u03c0 state in detail from the impurity Green's function approach for the isolated\nvacancy, which provided important insight in the interpretation of the results of the\nband calculations and the formation of the zero-mode states in the \u03c0 bands. This\nzero mode state is a slowly-decaying localized state that lives mostly on the majority\nsublattice. It spreads into the minority sublattice (the one containing the vacancy)\nand becomes a resonance state due to the second and the higher-neighbor interactions\nas well as the finite strength of the vacancy potential. The Green's function approach\nprovided a sinusoidal phase factor associated with the V\u03c0 wave function described\nby Eq. 28. In addition to the understanding of the vacancy electronic structure,\nour work provides important insight necessary for the understanding of impurities in\ngeneral such as iron and cobalt dopants and other complex defects.\n\n\fElectronic structure of the substitutional vacancy in graphene: Density-functional and Green's function studies23\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the U.
