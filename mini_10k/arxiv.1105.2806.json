We prove that a topological Clifford semigroup S is metrizable if and only if S is an M -space and\nthe set E = {e \u2208 S : ee = e} of idempotents of S is a metrizable G\u03b4 -set in S. The same metrization criterion\nholds also for any countably compact Clifford topological semigroup S.\n\nIntroduction\nAccording to the classical Birkhoff-Kakutani Theorem [2, 3.3.12], a topological group G is metrizable if and\nonly if it is first countable. In this paper we establish metrization criteria for topological Clifford semigroups.\nIn particular, in Theorem 2.4 we prove that a topological Clifford semigroup is metrizable if and only if S is an\nM -space and the subset of idempotents E = {e \u2208 S : ee = e} is a metrizable G\u03b4 -set in S. In Theorem 3.1 we shall\nprove that a countably compact Clifford topological semigroup S is metrizable if and only if E is a metrizable\nG\u03b4 -set in S. All topological spaces considered in this paper are regular.\n1. Clifford topological semigroups versus topological Clifford semigroups\nIn this section we discuss the interplay between Clifford topological semigroups and topological Clifford semigroups. A topological semigroup is a topological space S endowed with a continuous associative operation\n* : S \u00d7 S \u2192 S.\nA topological semigroup S is a Clifford topological semigroup if it is algebraically Clifford, i.e., S is the union of\ngroups. For each element x \u2208 S of a Clifford semigroup there is a unique element x\u22121 \u2208 S such that xx\u22121 x = x,\nx\u22121 xx\u22121 = x\u22121 and xx\u22121 = x\u22121 x. This element x\u22121 is called the inverse of x. The map (*)\u22121 : S \u2192 S,\n(*)\u22121 : x 7\u2192 x\u22121 , is called the inversion on S. In Clifford topological semigroups the inversion is not necessarily\ncontinuous.\nBy a topological Clifford semigroup we mean a Clifford topological semigroup S with continuous inversion\n(*)\u22121 : S \u2192 S. The simplest example of a Clifford topological semigroup which is not a topological Clifford\nsemigroup is the half-line [0, \u221e) endowed with the operation of multiplication of real numbers. This semigroup\nis locally compact. Such examples cannot occur among compact topological semigroups because of the following\nclassical result whose proof can be found in [8] or [9].\nTheorem 1.1. For each compact Clifford topological semigroup S the inversion operation (*)\u22121 : S \u2192 S is\ncontinuous, which implies that S is a topological Clifford semigroup.\nFor countably compact Clifford topological semigroup the inversion operation is sequentially continuous. Let\nus recall that a function f : X \u2192 Y between\u0001 topological spaces is sequentially continuous if for each convergent\n\u221e\nsequence (xn )\u221e\nn=1 in X the sequence f (xn ) n=1 is convergent in Y and lim f (xn ) = lim f (xn ).\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nThe following \"countably compact\" version of Theorem 1.1 was proved by Gutik, Pagon, and Repov\u0161 in [7].\n\nTheorem 1.2. For each countably compact Clifford topological semigroup S the inversion operation (*)\u22121 : S \u2192 S\nis sequentially continuous.\nThere are also some other conditions guaranteeing that a countably compact Clifford topological semigroup is\na topological Clifford semigroup. One of such conditions is the topological periodicity.\nA topological semigroup S is called topologically periodic if each element x \u2208 S is topologically periodic in the\nsense that for each neighborhood Ox \u2282 S of x there is an integer n \u2265 2 with xn \u2208 Ox .\nThe proof of the following criterion can be found in [7]:\nTheorem 1.3. A countably compact Clifford topological semigroup S is a topological Clifford semigroup if one\nof the following conditions is satisfied:\n(1) the space S is Tychonoff and the square S \u00d7 S is pseudocompact;\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 22A15; 54E35; 54E18; 54D30.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nTARAS BANAKH, OLEG GUTIK, OLES POTIATYNYK, ALEX RAVSKY\n\n(2) the square S \u00d7 S is countably compact;\n(3) S is sequential;\n(4) S is topologically periodic and first countable at each idempotent e \u2208 E.\nFor inverse Clifford topological semigroups this theorem was proved in [4].\n2. Cardinal characteristics of topological Clifford semigroups\nIn this section we evaluate some cardinal characteristics of topological Clifford semigroups.\nFor a topological space X and a subset A \u2282 X we shall be interested in the following cardinal characteristics:\n\u2022 the weight w(X) of X, equal to the smallest infinite cardinal \u03ba for which there is a base B of the topology\nof X with |B| \u2264 \u03ba;\n\u2022 the Lindel\u00f6f number l(X), equal to the smallest infinite cardinal \u03ba such that each open cover U of X has\na subcover V of cardinality |V| \u2264 \u03ba;\n\u2022 the pseudocharacter \u03c8(A, X) of A in X, equal to the smallest cardinality |U| of a family U of open subsets\nof X such that \u2229U = A;\n\u2022 the diagonal number \u2206(X) = \u03c8(\u2206X , X \u00d7 X), equal to the pseudocharacter of the diagonal \u2206X = {(x, x) :\nx \u2208 X} in the square X \u00d7 X.\nWe say that a topological space X has G\u03b4 -diagonal if \u2206(X) \u2264 \u05d00 . It is easy to see that \u2206(X) \u2264 w(X). By\na result of Arkhangelski [1, II.\u00a71], each locally compact space X has weight w(X) = l(X) * \u2206(X). In particular,\neach Lindel\u00f6f locally compact space with G\u03b4 -diagonal is metrizable. For topological inverse Clifford semigroups\nthe following theorem was proved in [3, 2.3(10)].\nTheorem 2.1. For a topological Clifford semigroup S and its subset of idempotents E = {e \u2208 S : ee = e} we\nhave the upper bound \u2206(S) \u2264 \u2206(E) * \u03c8(E, S).\nProof. By the definition\nT of \u2206(E), there is a family U of open neighborhoods of the diagonal \u2206E in E \u00d7 E such\nthat |U| = \u2206(E) and U = \u2206E . By a similar reason, there is a family V of open neighborhoods of the set E in\nS such that |V| = \u03c8(E, S) and \u2229V = E.\nIt follows from the continuity of the multiplication and the inversion on S that for any open sets U \u2208 U and\nV \u2208 V the set\nWU,V = {(x, y) \u2208 S \u00d7 S : (xx\u22121 , yy \u22121 ) \u2208 U, xy \u22121 \u2208 V }\nT\nis open in S \u00d7 S. Consider the family W = {WU,V : U \u2208 U, V \u2208 V} and observe that \u2206S = W and hence\n\u2206(S) \u2264 |W| \u2264 |U| * |V| = \u2206(E) * \u03c8(E, S).\n\u0003\nCombining Theorem 2.1 with the equality w(X) = l(X) * \u2206(X) holding for each locally compact space X (see\n[1]), we get the following\nCorollary 2.2. Each locally compact topological Clifford semigroup S has weight w(S) = l(S) * w(E) * \u03c8(E, S).\nThis corollary implies the following metrizability criterion:\nCorollary 2.3. A Lindel\u00f6f locally compact topological Clifford semigroup S is metrizable if and only if the set of\nidempotents E is a metrizable G\u03b4 -set in S.\nIn fact, this metrizability criterion holds more generally for topological Clifford semigroups which are M spaces. The class of M -spaces includes all metrizable spaces, all Lindel\u00f6f locally compact spaces, and all countably\ncompact spaces, see [6, \u00a73.5]. Let us recall [6, 3.5] that a topological space X is called an M -space if there is a\nsequence (Un )n\u2208\u03c9 of open covers of X such that each cover Un+1 star refines the cover Un+1 and for any point\nx \u2208 X, any sequence xn \u2208 St(x, Un ), n \u2208 \u03c9, has a cluster point in X. By a characterization theorem of Morita [10]\n(see also [6, 3.6]), a topological space X is an M-space if and only if it admits a closed continuous map f : X \u2192 Y\nonto a metrizable space Y with countably compact preimages f \u22121 (y) of points y \u2208 Y . By [6, 3.8], each M -space\nwith G\u03b4 -diagonal is metrizable. This fact combined with Theorem 2.1 implies the following metrization theorem\nfor topological Clifford semigroups.\nTheorem 2.4. A topological Clifford semigroup S is metrizable if and only if S is an M -space and E is a\nmetrizable G\u03b4 -set in S.\nFor topological inverse Clifford semigroups this metrizability criterion was proved in [3]. The following example\nshows that Theorem 2.4 does not hold without the M-space assumption.\n\n\fMETRIZABILITY OF CLIFFORD TOPOLOGICAL SEMIGROUPS\n\n3\n\nExample 2.5. There is a non-metrizable countable commutative topological Clifford semigroup S such that its\nset of idempotents E is compact metrizable and open in S.\nProof. Let X be any countable topological space with a unique non-isolated point x0 . Define a continuous\nsemilattice operation \u2227 on X letting\n(\nx if x = y\nx\u2227y =\nx0 if x 6= y.\nLet X\u0303 be the space X endowed with the topology of one-point compactification of the countable discrete space\nX \u2032 = X \\ {x0 }.\nConsider the commutative Clifford semigroup S = X \u00d7 Z endowed with the topology of the topological sum\n(X \u00d7 (Z \\ {0}) \u2295 (X\u0303 \u00d7 {0}). Here Z is the discrete additive group of integers. It is easy to check that S is a\ntopological Clifford semigroup whose set of idempotents E = X\u0303 \u00d7 {0} is metrizable, compact and open in S. The\nsemigroup S is metrizable if and only if so is the space X.\n\u0003\n3. Metrizability of countably compact Clifford topological semigroups\nTheorem 2.4 implies that a countably compact topological Clifford semigroup S is metrizable if and only if\nthe set E of idempotents of S is a metrizable G\u03b4 -set in S. In this section we shall generalize this metrization\ncriterium to countably compact Clifford topological semigroups.\nTheorem 3.1. A countably compact Clifford topological semigroup S is metrizable if and only if the set E of\nidempotents of S is a metrizable G\u03b4 -set in S.\nProof. Assume that E is a metrizable G\u03b4 -set in S. The continuity of the semigroup operation on S implies that\nthe set of idempotents E = {e \u2208 S : ee = e} is closed in S and hence is countably compact. Being metrizable,\nthe countably compact space E is compact.\nClaim 3.2. The space S is first countable at each point e \u2208 E.\nProof. Using the fact that E is a metrizable G\u03b4 -set in S, it can be shown that each singleton {e} \u2282 E is a G\u03b4 -set\nin S. Using theTregularity of the space S, we can choose a countable decreasing sequence (Un )n\u2208\u03c9 of open subsets\nof S such that n\u2208\u03c9 U n = {e}. The countable compactness of S implies that for each neighborhood U \u2282 S of e\nthere is n \u2208 \u03c9 with U n \u2282 U . This means that {Un }n\u2208\u03c9 is a neighborhood base at e, so S is first countable at\ne.\n\u0003\nClaim 3.3. The inversion (*)\u22121 : S \u2192 S is continuous at each idempotent e \u2208 E.\nProof. By Theorem 1.2, the inversion operation is sequentially continuous at hence is continuous at each point\nx \u2208 S having countable neighborhood base. In particular, the inversion is continuous at each idempotent\ne \u2208 E.\n\u0003\nClaim 3.4. For every idempotent e \u2208 E the maximal subgroup\nHe = {x \u2208 S : xx\u22121 = e}\nis a metrizable topological group.\nProof. The continuity of the semigroup operation on S implies that He is a paratopological group. By Claim 3.3,\nthe inversion of S is continuous at the idempotent e. Consequently, the inversion of the paratopological group\nHe is continuous at e and so He is a topological group, see [2, 1.3.12]. Since S is first countable at e, the\nparatopological group He is first countable. By the Birkhoff-Kakutani Theorem [2, 3.3.12], the topological group\nHe is metrizable.\n\u0003\nClaim 3.5. The semigroup S is topologically periodic.\nProof. Take any point a \u2208 S and denote by A the (closed) set of accumulation points of the sequence {an : n \u2208 N}\nin S. The continuity of the semigroup operation implies that A is a closed commutative subsemigroup in S. Let\n\u03c0 : S \u2192 E, \u03c0 : x 7\u2192 xx\u22121 = x\u22121 x, denote the projection of S onto the set E of idempotents of S. Observe that\nthe map \u03c0 is not necessarily continuous.\nWe claim that the projection \u03c0(A) \u2282 E has a minimal element with respect to the natural partial order on E\ndefined by x \u2264 y iff xy = x = yx. By Zorn Lemma, it suffices to prove that each linearly ordered subset L of\n\u03c0(A) has a lower bound in \u03c0(A). For each element \u03bb \u2208 L consider its lower cone\n\u2193\u03bb = {e \u2208 E : e \u2264 \u03bb} = {e \u2208 E : \u03bbe\u03bb = e}\n\n\f4\n\nTARAS BANAKH, OLEG GUTIK, OLES POTIATYNYK, ALEX RAVSKY\n\nand observe that it is a closed subset of E. Next, consider the closed subset\n\\\n\u2193L =\n\u2193\u03bb.\n\u03bb\u2208L\n\nThe compactness of E implies that each open neighborhood of \u2193L contain some lower\nT cone \u2193\u03bb, \u03bb \u2208 L. Since \u2193L\nis a closed G\u03b4 -set in E, there is a decreasing sequence {\u03bbn }n\u2208\u03c9 \u2282 L such that \u2193L = n\u2208\u03c9 \u2193\u03bbn . For every n \u2208 \u03c9\n\u22121\nchoose a point an \u2208 A with \u03c0(an ) = \u03bbn and observe that \u03bbn an \u03bbn = (an a\u22121\nn )an (an an ) = an and hence an lies in\nthe closed subset\n\u03bbn S\u03bbn = {x \u2208 S : \u03bbn x\u03bbn = x}\nof S. Then for every m \u2265 n we get \u03bbm \u2264 \u03bbn and hence am \u2208 \u03bbm S\u03bbm \u2282 \u03bbn S\u03bbn .\nBy the countable\ncompactness of A, the sequence (an )n\u2208\u03c9 has an accumulation\nT point a\u221e which lies in the\nT\nclosed subset n\u2208\u03c9 \u03bbn S\u03bbn of S. Let \u03bb\u221e = \u03c0(x\u221e ) \u2208 \u03c0(A). We claim that \u03bb\u221e \u2208 n\u2208\u03c9 \u2193\u03bbn = \u2193L, which means\nthat \u03bb\u221e is a lower bound for L in \u03c0(A).\nIndeed, for every n \u2208 \u03c9, the inclusion a\u221e \u2208 \u03bbn S\u03bbn implies\n\u22121\n\u03bb\u221e \u03bbn = a\u22121\n\u221e a\u221e \u03bbn = a\u221e a\u221e = \u03bb\u221e\n\nand similarly \u03bbn \u03bb\u221e = \u03bb\u221e , which means that \u03bb\u221e \u2264 \u03bbn .\nThus \u03bb\u221e is a lower bound of the chain L and by Zorn Lemma, the set \u03c0(A) has a minimal element e \u2208 E. Let\nb \u2208 A be any element with \u03c0(b) = e. We claim that b is topologically periodic. By the countable compactness of\nS, the sequence {bn : n \u2208 N} has an accumulation point c, which belongs to the closed subsemigroup A \u2229 eSe of\nS. It follows that e\u03c0(c) = ecc\u22121 = cc\u22121 = \u03c0(c) and \u03c0(c)e = c\u22121 ce = c\u22121 c = \u03c0(c), which means that \u03c0(c) \u2264 e.\nBy the minimality of e in the poset \u03c0(A), we get \u03c0(c) = e. Therefore, the point c is an accumulation point of the\nsequence (bn )\u221e\nn=1 in the metrizable topological group He . Then be can choose an increasing number sequence\n(nk )k\u2208\u03c9 such that limk\u2192\u221e (nk+1 \u2212 nk ) = \u221e and the sequence (bnk )k\u2208\u03c9 converges to c. Then the sequence\n(bnk+1 \u2212nk )k\u2208\u03c9 tends to the idempotent e = cc\u22121 and lies in the subsemigroup A.\nNow we see that the idempotent e belongs to the closed set A of accumulating points of the sequence (an )n\u2208\u03c9 .\nSince S is first countable at e, there is an increasing number sequence (mk )k\u2208\u03c9 such that the sequence (amk )k\u2208\u03c9\ntends to e. By the continuity of the inversion operation at e, the sequence (a\u2212mk )k\u2208\u03c9 also tends to e and hence\ne = ee\u22121 = limk\u2192\u221e amk a\u2212mk = aa\u22121 . Since limk\u2192\u221e amk = e = aa\u22121 , the sequence (amk +1 )k\u2208\u03c9 tends to\naa\u22121 a = a, witnessing that the element a is topologically periodic.\n\u0003\nClaims 3.2, 3.5 and Theorem 1.3(4) imply\nClaim 3.6. S is a topological Clifford semigroup.\nBeing countably compact, the space S is M -space and then it is metrizable by Theorem 2.4.\n\n\u0003\n\nReferences\n[1] A.V.
