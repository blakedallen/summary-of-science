Introduction\nThe calculation of the wave-function of a fully interacting many-body quantum system\nis a formidable challenge [1]. Hence, feasible approaches to the quantum many-body\nproblem are very important if one is interested in the properties of complex multiparticle systems. One such approach is Nobel-Prize-winning density functional theory\n(DFT) [1, 2]. The main theorem of DFT is the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem [3], which\nproves that the external potential of an interacting N-body system uniquely defines the\none-particle density of the ground-state via minimization of the corresponding energy\nfunctional. The mathematical foundations of DFT were extensively investigated and a\nrigorous formulation is available [4, 5]. Substantial extensions of the ground-state theory\ncan be found in the literature [2], e.g. to excited states or to relativistic systems.\nThe mainstay of applications of the minimization principle of DFT is due to Kohn and\n\n\f2\nSham [6]. The so-called Kohn-Sham scheme uses an auxiliary system of noninteracting\nparticles which has the same energy and one-particle density as the interacting system.\nTo make contact to the physical system one introduces the so-called exchange-correlation\nenergy functional [2]. It accounts for the difference between the combined kinetic and\ninteraction energy of the interacting system and the kinetic energy of the noninteracting Kohn-Sham system. The variational minimization of the energy with respect to\nthe density leads to a set of coupled, nonlinear single-particle differential equations,\nthe so-called Kohn-Sham equations. It can be rigorously proven that a self-consistent\nsolution of these equations will generate the exact one-particle ground-state density of\nthe corresponding interacting system [2]. In practice, however, the exchange-correlation\nenergy functional is not known and has to be approximated.\nAn exact extension of DFT to time-dependent systems was given in [7] by Runge and\nGross. By assuming the external potentials to be Taylor expandable in time about t = t0\nthey could prove a one-to-one correspondence between time-dependent densities and external potentials. However, the straightforward extension of the Kohn-Sham scheme to\nthe time-dependent case as shown in [7] led to the so-called symmetry-causality paradox\n[8]. This flaw in the time-dependent extension of DFT was soon realized to be connected\nto the naive application of the usual variational principle of time-dependent quantum\nmechanics to TDDFT [9]. Only with an extension of the Runge-Gross theorem by van\nLeeuwen in [10] one was able to justify a time-dependent Kohn-Sham scheme. There\nit was shown that by successive solution of Sturm-Liouville boundary value problems\none can formally construct a unique effective potential governing the time-evolution of\nthe noninteracting system such that it reproduces the interacting one-particle density.\nIn view of this theorem one does not need a variational approach analogously to timeindependent DFT and can obtain the exact one-particle density via propagation of the\ntime-dependent Kohn-Sham equations.\nNote that, although the extended Runge-Gross theorem [10] shows the uniqueness of\nthe effective potential, the conditions of existence were not investigated.\nThe intention of this work is not to give an introduction to TDDFT, for this we refer to [11], but to consider the mathematical foundations of the theory. In contrast to\nDFT a mathematically rigorous formulation of TDDFT is missing. Here we will take\na first step towards this goal. We will give conditions for the existence of a solution\nto the Sturm-Liouville boundary value problems at hand. We will introduce the set of\nexternal potentials and time-dependent densities under consideration. We will prove\nthat all orders of the Taylor expansions of the effective potentials exist, if the initial\nconfigurations and the different two-particle interactions as well as the external potential of the interacting system are spatially infinitely differentiable. Given that these\nconditions hold, we will show the set of v-representable time-dependent densities being\npurely determined by the initial one-particle density and its first derivative in time at\nt = t0 .\n\n\f3\nSection 2 summarizes the basic theorems of TDDFT so far. Section 3 outlines fundamental properties of the potentials and investigates the existence of general solutions\nof the corresponding Sturm-Liouville problems. In section 4 we introduce a certain set\nof potentials and v-representable densities and prove the existence of the solutions of\nall considered Sturm-Liouville boundary value problems, and hence all orders of the\nTaylor expansion of the effective potentials, under certain restrictions. Assuming these\nconditions we can evidence properties of the set of v-representable densities. Finally we\nconclude in section 5.\n2. Time-dependent density functional theory\nWe consider a general many-body Hamiltonian in atomic units of the form\n\u0124(t) = T\u0302 + V\u0302int + V\u0302 ([v]; t).\n(1)\n\u0001\nP R 3 \u2020\nThe operator T\u0302 =\nd r \u03c8\u0302\u03c3 (r) \u2212 21 \u22072 \u03c8\u0302\u03c3 (r) is the kinetic term, V\u0302int =\n\u03c3\nR\nR\nP\n1\nd3 rd3 r \u2032 vint (|r \u2212 r \u2032 |)\u03c8\u0302\u03c3\u2020 (r)\u03c8\u0302\u03c3\u2020 \u2032 (r \u2032 )\u03c8\u0302\u03c3\u2032 (r \u2032 )\u03c8\u0302\u03c3 (r) is the interaction and V\u0302 ([v]; t) =\n\u2032\n2\nR\u03c3,\u03c3 3\nP\nd r v(r, t) \u03c8\u0302\u03c3\u2020 (r)\u03c8\u0302\u03c3 (r) is the external potential, where \u03c8\u0302\u03c3\u2020 (r) and \u03c8\u0302\u03c3 (r) are the\n\u03c3\ncreation and annihilation operator with spin \u03c3 [12]. The interaction potential vint (|r\u2212r \u2032|)\nis arbitrary but will usually be chosen to be equal to the Coulomb interaction. The\nexternal one-particle potential v(r, t) typically consists of a static part, e.g. the attractive\nCoulomb potential of a fixed nucleus, and a time-dependent part, e.g. a laser pulse in\ndipole approximation and length gauge. The time-dependent one-particle density is\ndefined by the expectation value of\nX\nn\u0302(r) :=\n\u03c8\u0302\u03c3\u2020 (r)\u03c8\u0302\u03c3 (r)\n(2)\n\u03c3\n\nwith the time-dependent density matrix \u03c1\u0302(t), i.e.\nn(r, t) = hn\u0302(r)i = tr (\u03c1\u0302(t) n\u0302(r)) .\n\nWith the current-density operator\nh\ni\no\n1 Xn \u2020\n\u03c8\u0302\u03c3 (r)\u2207\u03c8\u0302\u03c3 (r) \u2212 \u2207\u03c8\u0302\u03c3\u2020 (r) \u03c8\u0302\u03c3 (r)\n\uf6be\u0302(r) :=\n2i \u03c3\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nit is straightforward to find the usual continuity equation via application of the\nHeisenberg equation\nD\nE\n\u2202t n(r, t) = \u2212 i [n\u0302(r), \u0124(t)]\u2212 = \u2212\u2207 * j(r, t),\n(5)\nwhere \u2202t \u2261 \u2202/\u2202t and [*, *]\u2212 is the usual commutator.

Assume\ntwo external potentials v(r, t) and v \u2032 (r, t), both Taylor expandable about the initial\ntime t = t0 , which differ by more than a merely time-dependent function c(t), i.e.\nv(r, t) \u2212 v \u2032 (r, t) 6= c(t). If we evolve an initial configuration \u03c1\u0302(t0 ) = \u03c1\u03020 of a finite multiparticle system in time with the two different external potentials, we can investigate the\ndifference of the time-derivatives of the current-densities at time t = t0 via application\nof equation (6). If the time-derivatives of the current-densities differ for some order,\nthen the corresponding densities will be different after an infinitesimal time-step. This\nleads to the Runge-Gross theorem [7]:\nTheorem 1 For every single-particle potential v(r, t) which can be expanded into a\nTaylor series with respect to the time coordinate around t = t0 , a map G : v(r, t) 7\u2192\nn(r, t) is defined by solving the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equations with fixed initial\nconfiguration \u03c1\u0302(t0 ) = \u03c1\u03020 and calculating the corresponding density n(r, t). This map can\nbe inverted up to an additive, merely time-dependent function in the potential.\nNow let us fix the additive merely time-dependent function in the potential to be equal\nto zero by the boundary condition v(r, t) \u2192 0 for |r| \u2192 \u221e. Hence we have an invertible\nmapping G which obviously depends on the initial configuration \u03c1\u03020 . The proof is not\nrestricted to Coulombic interactions and can be applied to any reasonable interaction.\nThe domain and the range of this mapping is not further investigated in the original\npaper [7]. With the mapping F : v(r, t) 7\u2192 \u03c1\u0302(t) defined by the solutions of the associated\nSchr\u00f6dinger equations we further find via F \u25e6 G\u22121 : n(r, t) 7\u2192 \u03c1\u0302(t) that every expectation\nvalue of an operator \u00d4, i.e. O = tr[\u00d4 \u03c1\u0302(t)], is uniquely determined by the density\nalone. Although this theorem holds also for noninteracting systems, it is not clear\nthat every density subject to the Runge-Gross theorem in an interacting system can be\nreproduced by some effective Kohn-Sham potential in a noninteracting system. In other\nwords, it is not known if the interacting v-representable density is also noninteracting\nv-representable. Initial attempts to construct such connections in the original paper [7]\nled to the symmetry-causality paradox [8].\nIn order to overcome these problems the extended Runge-Gross theorem was introduced\nin [10]. A sketch of the proof reads as follows:\nWe apply the continuity equation (5) to the local force balance equation (6), leading to\n+\n*\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u22022\n.\n(9)\nn(r, t) = \u2207 * [n(r, t)\u2207v(r, t)] + \u2202\u03bd \u2202\u03bc T\u0302\u03bc\u03bd (r) + \u0174\u03bd (r)\n\u2202t2\n|\n{z\n}\n=:q\u0302(r)\n\nIf we now assume the external potential v(r, t) as well as the density n(r, t) to be analytic\nabout t = t0 the different orders of the Taylor expansion are connected via equation (9)\n\n\f5\nleading to [11]\n(k+2)\n\nn\n\n(r) = q\n\n(k)\n\n(r) +\n\nk\nX\n\nk\nl\n\n!\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2207 * n(k\u2212l) (r)\u2207v (l) (r) ,\n\n(10)\n\nl=0\n= \u2202tk n(r, t)|t=t0\n\nfor k > 1 where we used n(k) (r)\nand q (k) (r) is defined by applying the\nHeisenberg equation k times to q\u0302(r) at time t = t0 . Hence, q (k) (r) contains terms v (l) (r)\nup to order l = k \u2212 1. For a second system with Hamiltonian\n\u2032\n\u0124 \u2032 (t) = T\u0302 + V\u0302int\n+ V\u0302 \u2032 ([v \u2032 ]; t)\n\n(11)\n\nand initial state \u03c1\u0302\u2032 (t0 ) = \u03c1\u0302\u20320 and accordingly redefined operator q\u0302 \u2032 (r) we can rederive\nequation (10) for the primed system. Given the time-dependent density n(r, t) of the\nunprimed system we can define the potential v \u2032 (r, t) leading to the same density in the\nprimed system in terms of its Taylor expansion in form of a Sturm-Liouville problem\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2207 * n(0) (r)\u2207v \u2032(k) (r) = n(k+2) (r) \u2212 q \u2032(k) (r)\n!\nk\u22121\nX\n\u0002\n\u0003\nk\n\u2212\n\u2207 * n(k\u2212l) (r)\u2207v \u2032(l) (r) .\n(12)\nl\nl=0\nWith this we can state the extended Runge-Gross theorem [10]:\n\nTheorem 2 For a Hamiltonian \u0124(t) with an analytic potential v(r, t) about t = t0 we\nassume the density n(r, t) generated via propagation of the initial configuration \u03c1\u03020 to be\nanalytic about t = t0 as well. For a second system \u0124 \u2032 (t) with initial configuration \u03c1\u03020\nsubject to the conditions\nn(r, t0 ) = n(0) (r) = n\u2032 (r, t0 ),\ntr (\u03c1\u03020 \u2207 * \uf6be\u0302(r))\n\n= n(1) (r) = tr (\u03c1\u0302\u20320 \u2207 * \uf6be\u0302(r)) ,\n\n(13a)\n(13b)\n\n\u2032\nand an interaction V\u0302int\nassumed such that its expectation value and its derivatives are\nfinite, the analytic potential v \u2032 (r, t) leading to the same density n(r, t) is uniquely defined\nup to a purely time-dependent function.\n\nAgain we can fix the purely time-dependent function of the potentials to be equal to\nzero by choosing the boundary condition v \u2032 (r, t) \u2192 0 for |r| \u2192 \u221e. The existence of this\npotential v \u2032 (r, t) is investigated in [9] by minimization of a corresponding functional.\nHowever, a rigorous proof of existence was not given.\nNote, in the above schematically depicted proof of the extended Runge-Gross theorem\none made use of the knowledge of the density n(r, t). However, we want a theory\npredicting the density. That TDDFT is a predictive theory can be seen if we use equation\n(10) for the primed and the unprimed system and assume both to yield the same density\nn(r, t). With the definition\nv \u2032 (r, t) = v(r, t) + v\u2206 (r, t)\nwe thus infer the Sturm-Liouville problem\nh\ni\n(k)\n\u2207 * n(0) (r)\u2207v\u2206 ([n]; r) = \u03b6 (k)(r) :=\n!\nk\u22121\nh\ni\nX\nk\n(l)\n(k\u2212l)\n(k)\n\u2032(k)\n\u2207* n\n(r)\u2207v\u2206 ([n]; r) .\nq (r) \u2212 q (r) \u2212\nl\nl=0\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\n\f6\nVia equation (15) one can generate v \u2032(k) (r) which then can be used in equation (10)\nto find the corresponding higher terms of the Taylor expansion of n(r, t). In return,\nthe higher terms of the density Taylor expansion again determine the next term in the\nTaylor expansion of the potential. Hence, only the initial configurations and the external\npotential of the unprimed system are needed to generate the expansion of the density\nabout t = t0 . However, the special form of q (k) (r) defined by successive application\nof the Heisenberg equation led to the question wether a simultaneous solution of the\nunprimed system is required in principle [14, 15].\n3. Properties of the potentials and the Sturm-Liouville problem\nIn order to define the sets of one-particle potentials and the associated one-particle\ndensities, i.e. the v-representable densities, we start by looking at the properties of\nthe corresponding Hamiltonian \u0124(t). We demand the Hamiltonian to be self-adjoint for\nevery time t on the domain of the kinetic energy operator dom(T\u0302 ). The free Hamiltonian\n\u01240 = T\u0302 + V\u0302int with V\u0302int the Coulomb interaction can be shown to fulfill this constraint\n\u2032\n[5] and any other interaction V\u0302int\nunder consideration will be assumed to do so as well.\n\u2032\nThis condition is trivially fulfilled if we choose V\u0302int\n\u2261 0. With the theory of Kato\nperturbations [5] we find the simple condition\nv(t) \u2208 L2 (R3 ) + L\u221e (R3 )\n\n(16)\n\nfor every time t. Here L2 and L\u221e are the usual Lebesgue quotient spaces with norm\nk.k2 and k.k\u221e , respectively. L2 (R3 ) + L\u221e (R3 ) is a Banach space with the norm\nn\nkv(t)k = inf kv1 (t)k2 + kv2 (t)k\u221e v1 (t) \u2208 L2 (R3 ), v2 (t) \u2208 L\u221e (R3 ),\no\nv(t) = v1 (t) + v2 (t) .\n(17)\nThe effective potentials v \u2032 (r, t) leading to the same density as in the Coulombic\nsystem exists in accordance to the extended Runge-Gross proof if all orders of equation\n(12) have an existing solution. Accordingly, this is true if all orders of equation (15)\nhave a solution with v \u2032 (r, t) = v(r, t) + v\u2206 (r, t). A way to investigate the existence of\nsuch solutions to such Sturm-Liouville boundary value problems is within the following\nframework.\n\nLet us first introduce the bounded open domain \u03a9 \u2282 R3 with piecewise C 1 boundary\n\u2202\u03a9. For the real Hilbert space L2 (\u03a9) with scalar product denoted as h*, *i2 and norm\nk * k2 we define the Sobolev space [5]\nn\no\nW 1,2 (\u03a9) = u \u2208 L2 (\u03a9) \u2202j u \u2208 L2 (\u03a9), j = 1, ..., 3\n(18)\nwith norm kuk21,2 = kuk22 + k\u2207uk22 . Here the partial derivatives \u2202j u are understood\nin the distributional sense. Further the real Hilbert space H01 (\u03a9) is defined to be the\nclosure in W 1,2(\u03a9) of the infinitely differentiable functions compactly supported in \u03a9.\n\n\f7\nHence, functions u \u2208 H01 (\u03a9) fulfill the boundary condition u = 0 on \u2202\u03a9 naturally. The\npreviously considered Sturm-Liouville problem (15) in shorthand notation reads as\n\u2207 * (n\u2207v) = \u03b6\n\n(19)\n\nand defines a bilinear form Q on H01 (\u03a9) by\nQ(u, v) = hu, \u2212\u2207 * (n\u2207v)i2 = h\u2207u, n\u2207vi2\n\n(20)\n\nwhere we used integration by parts and that functions in H01 (\u03a9) vanish at the border.\nWe take advantage of the fact that (19) has a (weak) solution v \u2208 H01 (\u03a9) if, and only\nif, Q(u, v) = \u2212hu, \u03b6i2 for all u \u2208 H01 (\u03a9). This immediately leads us to the necessity\n\u03b6 \u2208 L2 (\u03a9). Now the answer to the question of solvability is at hand with the Theorem\nof Lax-Milgram. [16]\nTheorem 3 (Lax-Milgram) Let Q be a coercive continuous bilinear form on a Hilbert\nspace H. Then for every continuous linear functional f on H, there exists a unique\nuf \u2208 H such that\nQ(u, uf ) = f (u)\n\n(21)\n\nholds for all u \u2208 H.\nA bilinear form Q is said to be coercive if there exists a constant c > 0 such that\nQ(u, u) \u2265 ckuk2 for all u \u2208 H. In our case this can be established by means of the\nPoincar\u00e9 inequality\nkuk2 \u2264 \u03bbk\u2207uk2 ,\n\n\u2200u \u2208 H01 (\u03a9)\n\n(22)\n\nwhere 0 < \u03bb = \u03bb(\u03a9) < \u221e. As an additional assumption we add that n is bounded by a\nconstant m > 0 almost everywhere on \u03a9 from below. Then\nQ(u, u) = h\u2207u, n\u2207ui2 \u2265 mk\u2207uk22\n\n\u03bb2 Q(u, u) \u2265 \u03bb2 mk\u2207uk22 \u2265 mkuk22\n\n(23a)\n(23b)\n\nCombination of these results yields\n\u0001\nm\nm\n2\n2\nkuk\n+\nk\u2207uk\nkuk21,2 .\n(24)\nQ(u, u) \u2265\n2\n2 =\n2\n1+\u03bb\n1 + \u03bb2\nWe thus have established the coercivity of Q. As for the continuity we add another\nassumption on n that is boundedness from above by a constant M > 0 almost\neverywhere on \u03a9.\n|Q(u, v) \u2212 Q(u0 , v)| = |Q(u \u2212 u0 , v)| = |h\u2207(u \u2212 u0 ), n\u2207ui2|\n\n\u2264 Mk\u2207(u \u2212 u0 )k2 * k\u2207vk2 \u2264 Mku \u2212 u0 k1,2 * kvk1,2 < \u221e\n\n(25)\n\nThese restrictions on n also imply that the differential operator defined by the left\nhand side of (19) is elliptic. If n can be assumed to be continuous on the closed domain\n\u03a9\u0304, then n also attains its extremal values on \u03a9\u0304 and the restrictions reduce to the form\n0 < n < \u221e on \u03a9\u0304.\n\n(26)\n\n\f8\nNow everything left to show for the application of Theorem 3 is that the right hand\nside \u2212h*, \u03b6i2 is indeed a continuous linear functional on the real Hilbert space H01 (\u03a9).\nThis is easily established by considering for arbitrary u, u0 \u2208 H01 (\u03a9)\n|hu, \u03b6i2 \u2212 hu0, \u03b6i2| = |hu \u2212 u0 , \u03b6i2|\n\n\u2264 ku \u2212 u0 k2 * k\u03b6k2 \u2264 ku \u2212 u0 k1,2 * k\u03b6k2 < \u221e.\n\n(27)\n\nWe subsume our results for the solvability of the Sturm-Liouville problem (19) in\nthe following corollary.\nCorollary 1 Consider the Sturm-Liouville problem \u2207 * (n\u2207v) = \u03b6 on the bounded open\ndomain \u03a9 \u2282 R3 with piecewise C 1 boundary. Let \u03b6 \u2208 L2 (\u03a9) and n : \u03a9 \u2192 R be almost\neverywhere bounded by 0 < m \u2264 n \u2264 M < \u221e. Then there exists a unique solution\nv \u2208 H01 (\u03a9).\nLooking back to the original formulation of the Sturm-Liouville problem (15) we\nnote that if n(0) fulfills the prerequisites of n in Corollary 1 and the right hand side\n(k)\nis indeed in L2 (\u03a9) then all orders of the potential v\u2206 are uniquely defined in H01 (\u03a9).\nWe now want to examine which constraints on the higher orders n(k) are sufficient for\n\u03b6 (k) \u2208 L2 (\u03a9). For this we assume q (k) and q \u2032(k) already in L2 (\u03a9) for all k and thus we get\n(0)\na unique v\u2206 \u2208 H01 (\u03a9) trivially by Corollary 1. For k > 1 we apply inductive reasoning:\n(l)\nLet us assume v\u2206 \u2208 H01 (\u03a9) be given uniquely for l < k. Then (15) in a shorter notation\nreads as\n!\nk\u22121\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\nk\n(l)\n(k)\n\u2207 * n(k\u2212l) \u2207v\u2206 .\n(28)\n\u2207 * n(0) \u2207v\u2206 = q (k) \u2212 q \u2032(k) \u2212\nl\nl=0\n\nThe (elliptic) differential operator on the left defines the same coercive continuous\nbilinear form on H01 (\u03a9) as before, thus everything to show for an application of Theorem\n3 is that the right hand side yields a continuous linear functional. The sum of such\nfunctionals is again linear continuous therefore we can examine all terms separately.\nFor q (k) and q \u2032(k) the same reasoning as in (27) applies. Finally with u, u0 \u2208 H01 (\u03a9)\ncontinuity of the separate terms of the sum is established by\n\u0011E\n\u0011E\nD\n\u0010\nD\n\u0010\n(l)\n(l)\n(k\u2212l)\n(k\u2212l)\n\u2212 u0 , \u2207 * n\n\u2207v\u2206\nu, \u2207 * n\n\u2207v\u2206\n2\n2\nE\nD\n(l)\n(l)\n(k\u2212l)\n\u2264 k\u2207(u \u2212 u0 )k2 * kn(k\u2212l) \u2207v\u2206 k2\n= \u2207(u \u2212 u0 ), n\n\u2207v\u2206\n(k\u2212l)\n\n\u2264 ku \u2212 u0 k1,2 * kn\n\n(l)\n\n2\n(l)\n\u2207v\u2206 k2\n\n(l)\n\n< \u221e if n(k\u2212l) \u2207v\u2206 \u2208 L2 (\u03a9).\n\n(29)\n\n(l)\n\nBy induction we know that v\u2206 \u2208 H01 (\u03a9) and thus \u2207v\u2206 \u2208 L2 (\u03a9) so n(k) bounded\nalmost everywhere by some Mk > 0 for all k is a sufficient condition for Theorem 3 to\nbe applied. We subsume this in a second corollary.\nCorollary 2 Consider the system of Sturm-Liouville problems (15) on the bounded open\ndomain \u03a9 \u2282 R3 with piecewise C 1 boundary. Let q (k) , q \u2032(k) \u2208 L2 (\u03a9) and n(k) : \u03a9 \u2192 R\nbe almost everywhere bounded by n(k) \u2264 Mk with Mk > 0 for all k and additionally\nn(0) \u2265 m > 0 almost everywhere. Then there exists a unique sequence of solutions\n(k)\nv\u2206 \u2208 H01 (\u03a9).\n\n\f9\nIf we turn to the problem of a classical solution we refer the reader to the Weyl\nLemma as given in [17, 18] in various forms. (In a more general formulation it can be\nfound as the \"fundamental theorem on weak solutions\" in [19].) There the operator\nK\u0302v = \u2207 * (n\u2207v) has domain\no\nn\n1\n2\n2\ndom(K\u0302) = u u \u2208 C (\u03a9\u0304), u \u2208 C (\u03a9), K\u0302u \u2208 L (\u03a9); u = 0 on \u2202\u03a9 . (30)\nTheorem 4 For n > 0 on \u03a9\u0304 and n \u2208 C 3 (\u03a9\u0304) and the boundary condition v = 0 on \u2202\u03a9,\nthe equation\n\u2207 * (n\u2207v) = \u03b6\n\n(31)\n\nhas a classical solution v \u2208 dom(K\u0302) if \u03b6 \u2208 C 1 (\u03a9\u0304) or \u03b6 is H\u00f6lder continuous, i.e.\n|\u03b6(r) \u2212 \u03b6(r \u2032)| \u2264 h|r \u2212 r \u2032 |\u03b1 for all r, r \u2032 \u2208 \u03a9\u0304 with h and 0 < \u03b1 < 1 independent of\nr, r \u2032 .\nWether \u03b6 (k) in our actual problem (15) fulfills one of the conditions for a weak or\nclassical solution, respectively, depends on the properties of the initial configurations\nand on the interactions under consideration. The terms q (k) and q \u2032(k) implicate already\nfor k = 0 spatial partial derivatives of order 4 and spatial partial derivatives of the\ninvolved interaction potential of order 3. Hence, to have a well defined Sturm-Liouville\nproblem, the wave-functions of the initial configurations and the interaction potentials\nhave to fulfill certain restrictions with respect to their spatial behavior.\n4. Sets of potentials and v-representable densities\nWe will introduce the set of external potentials for the extended Runge-Gross theorem\nin accordance to the classical Sturm-Liouville theory. Therefore, the defined sets will\nonly be subsets of the actual sets of v-representable densities and potentials connected\nvia the extended Runge-Gross theorem. Further, we will restrict our considerations on\nthe above introduced domain \u03a9 \u2282 R3 . We assume the boundary to be far away from\nthe center of the system such that it will not influence the dynamics. One has to be\ncareful at this point as we will assume the initial one-particle density to be nonzero on\n\u03a9\u0304, hence also on the boundary \u2202\u03a9. This is different to the usual notion of a physical\nsystem restricted to a finite region, where one assumes an infinite boundary potential\nto restrict the wave-function to this domain. In this case the wave-function and thus\nthe one-particle potential will be zero at the boundary.\nFor a free Hamiltonian \u01240 = T\u0302 + V\u0302int assumed self-adjoint and an initial configuration\n\u03c1\u03020 at time t = t0 we have\nn\nV(\u03c1\u03020 , V\u0302int ) := v v analytic about t = t0 , v(t) \u2208 dom(K\u0302),\no\n(32)\nv real; n[v] analytic about t = t0 for \u03c1\u03020 and V\u0302int .\nHere n[v] is the time-dependent density, defined via the propagation of the initial\nconfiguration \u03c1\u03020 with the Hamiltonian \u0124(t) = T\u0302 + V\u0302int + V\u0302 ([v]; t). It is straightforward\n\n\f10\nto proof self-adjointness of this Hamiltonian by application of the Kato perturbation\ntheory [5] as one can use v(t) \u2208 L\u221e (\u03a9). Further we define the set of v-representable\nvariations by\n\u221e\nn\nX\n1 (k)\nn ([v]; r)(t \u2212 t0 )k for \u03c1\u03020 and V\u0302int ,\n\u03b4N (\u03c1\u03020 , V\u0302int ) := \u03b4n \u03b4n(r, t) =\nk!\nk=2\no\nv \u2208 V(\u03c1\u03020 , V\u0302int ) .\n(33)\nThe set of v-representable densities is an affine set\n\nN (\u03c1\u03020 , V\u0302int ) := n(0) (r) + n(1) (r, t) + \u03b4N (\u03c1\u03020 , V\u0302int ),\n\n(34)\n\nwhere n(0) (r) = n(r, t0 ) is the initial density and n(1) (r, t) = tr(\u03c1\u03020 \u2207 * \uf6be\u0302(r))(t \u2212 t0 ) in\naccordance to (13a) and (13b), respectively. For these sets we then have in accordance\nto the Runge-Gross theorem an invertible mapping\nv\u03c1\u03020 : N (\u03c1\u03020 , V\u0302int ) \u2192 V(\u03c1\u03020 , V\u0302int )\n\n(35)\n\nn(r, t) 7\u2192 v\u03c1\u03020 ([n]; r, t)\n\nconnecting the v-representable one-particle densities with the external potentials. Nevertheless, if we now define a second mapping for a different initial configuration \u03c1\u0302\u20320 subject\n\u2032\nto the conditions (13a) and (13b), and a different interaction V\u0302int\n, we do not know if n is\n\u2032\n\u2032\nsimultaneously element in N (\u03c1\u03020 , V\u0302int ) and N (\u03c1\u03020 , V\u0302int ). This, however, is of fundamental\nimportance if we want a rigorous formulation of the time-dependent Kohn-Sham scheme.\nTo achieve this goal we introduce further restrictions. We will assume smooth interactions and initial configurations in what follows. This excludes the usual Coulombic\ninteraction as it is not infinitely differentiable at the origin. However, one may regularize the Coulombic interaction by a so-called soft-core interaction, i.e. by replacing\n\u221a\n|r| \u2192 r 2 + \u01eb and \u01eb > 0.\nDue to equation (10) we have a direct connection between v-representable densities and\npotentials. Hence, we can formulate the following lemma\nLemma 1 Let \u03c1\u03020 be chosen such that all its wavefunctions are in C \u221e (\u03a9\u0304N ),\nv Taylor expandable about t = t0 , v (k) \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a9\u0304) \u2200 k, and vint (|r \u2212 r \u2032 |) infinitely\ndifferentiable. Then n(k) (r) \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a9\u0304) for all k.\nProof. We will use equation (10). Obviously we have n(0) (r) and n(1) (r) in C \u221e (\u03a9\u0304).\nThus n(2) (r) is in C \u221e (\u03a9\u0304) if q (0) (r) is infinitely differentiable, where\nh\ni\nq (0) (r) = tr \u03c1\u03020 q\u0302(r) .\n(36)\nq\u0302(r) consists of partial derivatives with respect to r and of derivatives of vint (|r \u2212r \u2032 |). We\nhave assumed vint (|r \u2212 r \u2032 |) infinitely differentiable. Hence, we have q (0) (r) \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a9\u0304). For\nn(3) (r) we need to know q (1) (r). This is the commutator of q\u0302(r) with \u0124(t) at t = t0 . All\nfunctions in \u0124(t) are infinitely differentiable. Again the above reasoning applies, and\nwe find q (1) (r) \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a9\u0304). All higher terms are to be found via successive application of\n\n\f11\nthe Heisenberg equation for q\u0302(r) with \u0124(t) at t = t0 . The only difference to the above\nreasoning is the appearance of v (k) (r)-terms, which are again infinitely differentiable.\nTherefore one can successively construct all n(k) (r) \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a9\u0304). \u0003\nNow we introduce the restricted set of smooth one-particle potentials\nn\no\nV \u2217 (\u03c1\u03020 , V\u0302int ) = v v \u2208 V(\u03c1\u03020 , V\u0302int ), v(t) \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a9\u0304) .\n\n(37)\n\nand by lemma 1 the corresponding smooth v-representable one-particle densities\n\u221e\nn\nX\n1 (k)\nn ([v]; r)(t \u2212 t0 )k for \u03c1\u03020 and V\u0302int ,\nN \u2217 (\u03c1\u03020 , V\u0302int ) = n n(r, t) =\nk!\nk=0\no\n\u2217\nv \u2208 V (\u03c1\u03020 , V\u0302int ) .\n(38)\n\nWith this we can reformulate the extended Runge-Gross theorem as follows.\n\nTheorem 5 Let \u03c1\u03020 and V\u0302int be infinitely differentiable, n(r, t) \u2208 N \u2217 (\u03c1\u03020 , V\u0302int ) and\nv\u03c1\u03020 ([n]; r, t) = v(r, t) \u2208 V \u2217 (\u03c1\u03020 , V\u0302int ) the associated external potential.

From the proof of lemma 1 we know that all q (k) and q \u2032(k) are infinitely\ndifferentiable. As we have assumed n0 (r) > 0 we can apply theorem 4 from which\nit is clear that\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2207 * n(0) (r)\u2207v \u2032(k) (r) =\n!\nk\u22121\nX\n\u0002\n\u0003\nk\n\u2207 * n\u2032(k\u2212l) (r)\u2207v \u2032(k) (r)\n(44)\nq (k) (r) \u2212 q \u2032(k) (r) \u2212\nl\nl=0\n\nhas an existing solution for k = 0 if the right hand side is C 1 (\u03a9\u0304). Obviously v \u2032(0) (r)\nexists due to theorem 4 and is infinitely differentiable. In the next step we can use\n\n\f12\nv \u2032(0) (r) in the Sturm-Liouville equation defining v \u2032(1) (r). Again existence is guaranteed\nand we have v \u2032(1) (r) \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a9\u0304) [20]. One can now successively construct v\u03c1\u03020 ,\u03c1\u0302\u20320 . Then\n(v + v\u03c1\u03020 ,\u03c1\u0302\u20320 ) is given via its Taylor series within its radius of convergence in accordance to\nthe extended Runge-Gross proof [10]. This construction holds for every n \u2208 N \u2217(\u03c1\u03020 , V\u0302int ),\n\u2032\nand we have n \u2208 N \u2217 (\u03c1\u0302\u20320 , V\u0302int\n) as well. Hence, the set of v-representable densities does\nnot depend on the smooth interaction or on the smooth initial configuration. \u0003\nHere it became obvious why we restricted our considerations to infinitely differentiable\ninitial configurations and potentials. With this assumptions we can guarantee the existence of all the classical Sturm-Liouville boundary value problems on \u03a9. For the general,\ni.e., weak case, we need to make sure that all q (k) , q \u2032(k) and hence \u03b6 (k) are in L2 (\u03a9), in\norder to proof the existence of a solution using corollary 2.\nThe special case of a rigorous Kohn-Sham theorem is straightforward as V\u0302int \u2261 0 is of\ncourse infinitely differentiable. One finds that for the above restrictions all interactingv-representable densities are noninteracting-v-representable because N \u2217 (\u03c1\u03020 , V\u0302int ) =\nN \u2217 (\u03c1\u0302\u20320 , 0). Only a noninteracting initial configuration is needed. The condition of\nn(0) (r) > 0 for the existence of the effective potential may be relaxed if there exists\nsome time t1 in a sufficiently small neighbourhood of t0 for which n(r, t1 ) > 0. Then we\ncould use \u03c1\u0302(t1 ) as new initial state and prove existence at that time provided we also\nhave the corresponding \u03c1\u0302\u2032 (t1 ).\n5. Conclusion\nUnder certain assumptions we can state sufficient constraints on the one-particle\ndensity such that the existence of the effective potential, possibly in the weak sense, is\nguaranteed. However, only for classical solutions of the corresponding Sturm-Liouville\nboundary value problems we can reformulate the extended Runge-Gross theorem such\nthat existence of the effective potentials is granted. As long as we consider smooth\ninitial states and smooth interactions the Kohn-Sham system exactly reproduces the\nphysical one-particle density. In general, as pointed out in [9], it seems safe to assume\nexistence of the Kohn-Sham potential for physical systems. Nevertheless, a rigorous\nproof of principle is of importance for the foundations of the theory.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.\nReferences\n[1] Kohn W 1999 Rev.
