However attempts to date to directly detect\ncandidate dark matter particles have been have been at\nbest unclear and at worst fruitless. Over the past few\ndecades, attempts to reconcile anomalous observations\nof galactic dynamics without resorting to dark matter\nhave been the driving forces behind modified gravity theories. These have centred around a prescription for a\nmodified force law [1], which reduce to Newtonian dynamics at \"large\" accelerations and modified dynamics\nat \"small\" accelerations (large and small here are relative\nto the Milgrom characteristic acceleration taken here as\na0 \u2248 10\u221210 ms\u22122 ). In doing so, the observed flattening\nof galaxy rotation curves and the empirical Tully-Fisher\nrelation can both be satisfied [2]. Recent work on an\nexperimental observation of theories with a preferred acceleration scale [3, 4, 5] suggest that anomalously large\ntidal stresses should be present around the gravitational\nsaddle points (SP) scattered throughout the Solar System. The proposed LISA Pathfinder (LPF) mission [6]\ncould be capable of serving as an accelerometer of unprecedented accuracy. The instrument, essentially, consists of two test masses, orientated such that they are\nin a free fall, with a laser interferometer between them.\nIn this way, it is possible to measure the differential acceleration between the two bodies and hence infer the\ntidal stresses (by factoring the inter mass spacing). With\nsuch an instrument, we suggest it could be possible to\nobserve the onset of MONDian behaviour (rather than\nat the scales present at galaxies, where MONDian behaviour will dominate the dynamics) in the low acceleration regime around these SP. The purpose of this paper\nis extend previous analyses done for the modified gravity\nsaddle point science case, based upon a scenario where\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: ali.mozaffari05@imperial.ac.uk\n\nan LPF mission extension is granted. This would involve redirecting the spacecraft from its location parked\nat Lagrange point L1 to a saddle of the Sun-Earth-Moon\nsystem [7] once its nominal mission is completed. Previous analysis have considered non-linear theories with\nmodified Poisson equations, which naturally give rise to\nmodified gravity behaviour (as seen most clearly in [8]).\nA review of the different non-relativistic limits of preferred acceleration scale theories [5] categorised these as\ntypes I, II and III (we summarise these briefly in Appendix A). In this work, we examine type II theories,\nwhere the dynamics are governed by a physical potential\n\u03a6, composed of \u03a6 = \u03a6N + \u03c6, with the usual\n\u22072 \u03a6N = 4\u03c0G\u03c1\n\n(1)\n\nThe field \u03c6 is ruled by a driven linear Poisson equation\nk\n\u2207 * (\u03bd(w)\u2207\u03a6N )\n4\u03c0\n\n\u22072 \u03c6 =\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the argument of free function \u03bd is given by\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\nk\n|\u2207\u03a6N |\n(3)\n4\u03c0\na0\n\u221a\nand we require that \u03bd \u223c 1/ w for w \u226a 1 and that \u03bd \u2192\nconstant when w \u226b 1. Consider now just writing\nw=\n\n\u22072 \u03a6 = \u2207 * (\u03bd\u0302(w)\u2207\u03a6N )\n\n(4)\n\n\u03ba\nwhere \u03bd\u0302 = 1 + 4\u03c0\n\u03bd. We can divide our theories into two\ndistinct subclasses, where crucially\n\n\u03bd\u21920\n\u03bd\u21921\n\nIIA\nIIB\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nType IIB theories in the large acceleration regime have\nGren = G(1 + \u03ba/4\u03c0), due to the scalar field mimicking\n\u03ba\na rescaled Newtonian potential \u03c6 \u2192 4\u03c0\n\u03a6N . In IIA theories, it can be argued we need only a single physical\npotential \u03a6 and Newtonian field \u03a6N plays only an auxiliary role (and so \u03ba need not appear at all) - meaning\nthere is no G renormalisation. As pointed out in [5], the\n\n\f2\neffect of which is that the triggering of MONDian effects\nwould happen at atrig = a0 (at a distance of r \u223c 2.2m\nfrom the saddle). With such a tiny bubble, these theories would escape the net of an LPF test, at least for the\nEarth-Sun system. With this in mind, we will stick to\ntype IIB theories here, the case for testing other types of\nMONDian theory have been considered separately [5, 9].\nSimilarly, we stress that it is important that we consider\nformulations wedded to fully relativistic theories (rather\nthan just a scalar Lagrangian theory like AQUAL [10]),\neven though we are not directly testing these full theories\nthemselves. Their cosmologies however, do provide the\nnecessary constraints on the gravitational constant G, the\nbare value of G appears in the Friedman equations and\nso from BBN constraints can be fixed. As we will see,\nthis issue is not a trivial one in modified gravity theories.\nDeriving the full field equations and taking the weak field\nlimit as necessary allows us to find the modified Poisson\nequations for these theories consistently. To this end, we\nwill consider a theory arising from BiMOND [11]. Additionally readers should consider the cosmologies of these\ntheories, as suggested in [12].\nThe structure of this paper is as follows, we firstly consider analytical and numerical solutions from solving this\ntheory around the Earth-Sun SP. Next we move onto consider the integrated signal to noise ratio (SNR) as a measure of how sensitive the LPF instruments will be, the\nmain results of which are contained in Figures 3 and 4.\nA look at converting a null signal into a constraint on the\nparameter space of our theories is the subject of Section 2\n- seeing whether we could differentiate between different\nmodified gravity theories. Finally Section 4 looks at parameterised approaches to these theories and looks to the\nfuture. We leave detailed derivations and computational\nmethods to the appendices.\n\n2.\n\nSolutions, Tidal Stresses and Signal to Noise Ratios\n\nIn this analysis, we will make use of both analytical\nand numerical results. We suggest using a free function\n\u03bd of the form\n\u03bd=\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1+ 2\nw\n\n\u00131/4\n\n(7)\n\nWe outline in Appendix B some reasons for this choice\nand with it we solve Equation ?? around the SP (recalling\nwe are free of sources),\n\n\u22072 \u03c6 =\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u03ba \uf8ec\n\u03ba\n\uf8f7\n2\n\u03a6 + \u2207\u03bd * \u2207\u03a6N \uf8f8\n\u2207 * (\u03bd\u2207\u03a6N ) =\n\uf8ed\u03bd \u2207\n| {z N}\n4\u03c0\n4\u03c0\n=0|SP\n\nWe can approximate the Newtonian near to the SP with\na linear profile, which in spherical coordinates takes the\n\nform,\nFN = \u2212\u2207\u03a6N = ArN = Ar(Nr er + N\u03c8 e\u03c8 )\n1\nNr = (1 + 3 cos 2\u03c8)\n4\n3\nN\u03c8 = \u2212 sin 2\u03c8\n4\n\n(8)\n\nUsing this form of the Newtonian field as our source,\nwe proceed to solving the resulting system of equations.\nRecall that the we have both a deep MONDian (DM)\nregime, close to the saddle where w \u226a 1 and an quasiNewtonian (QN) regime further out, where w \u226b 1. Separating these will be a boundary which using the linearised\nNewtonian we can find,\n\u0010 \u03ba \u00112 Ar|N|\n= 1\n(9)\nw=\n4\u03c0\na0\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u00132\n1\n16\u03c0 2 a0\n2\n2\n2\n2\nr cos \u03c8 + sin \u03c8 = r0 =\n(10)\n4\n\u03ba2 A\nAs such we find an ellipsoidal (or bubble shaped) boundary, with semi-major axis which we denote r0 .

Such a code\nwas first employed to study these theories in [4] and subsequently adapted for more general free functions in [8].\nIn Appendix C, we detail the modifications required for\nthis work. Consider the Earth-Sun saddle, using a 2573\nlattice of physical size 104 km with a typical central resolution of \u223c2.6 km. Running the code delivers us predictions for the modified forces close to the saddle, which as\nFigure 1 shows are a good match to analytical solutions\nin their respective domain and provide the appropriate\ninterpolation in the intermediate region. Next consider\nthat LPF is sensitive to differential acceleration, from\nwhich we can infer the tidal stresses of our signal. Note\nalso that the \u03c6 field produces both a MONDian effective\nfield and a rescaled Newtonian component. Taking these\ninto account, the observable tidal stress will be of the\nform\nSij = \u2212\n\n\u2202 2\u03c6\nk \u2202 2 \u03a6N\n+\n\u2202xi \u2202xj\n4\u03c0 \u2202xi \u2202xj\n\n(13)\n\n\f3\n1\n\nnumerical \u03c8=0\nnumerical \u03c8=\u03c0\nanalytical (deep\u2212MOND)\nanalytical (quasi\u2212Newtonian)\n\n10\n\nType I\nType IIB\nNewtonian\nNoise\n\n\u221212\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u03ba |gr| / a0\n\nASD s\u22122 / Hz\u22121/2\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n\u221213\n\n10\n\n\u221214\n\n10\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n0\n\nr / r0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\nIt is important that we know both field components to the\nsame degree of accuracy or systematic errors can crop up\ndue to the imperfect subtraction of the Newtonian field.\nUsing the techniques of noise matched filtering from gravitational wave searches [13], we can compute the Signal\nto Noise Ratios (SNR) of these anomalous tidal stresses\nwith LPF. The basic idea laid is to correlate a time series x(t) with an optimized template designed to provide maximal SNR, given the signal shape h(t) and the\nnoise properties of the instrument. Whilst the specifics\nof the instrument noise won't be known properly until\nthe satellite is in situ, there exist nominal requirements\nthat it must meet [14], as well as best estimates for the\nnoise signal waveform. In our setup, we align the line\njoining the Sun-Earth as our x axis, such that we have\ntrajectories of the form\n(14)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the spacecraft, b is the impact\nparameter and t = 0 corresponds to the point of closest\nsaddle approach.

Using the parameters\nb = 50km fly-by and v = 1.5 ms\u22121 , we compare between type\nI and IIB theories, finding in this scenario SNRs of 28 and 35,\nrespectively.\n\nmake this analysis concrete, consider a flyby at b = 50km.\nWe plot the noise and signal, terms of amplitude spectral\ndensity (ASD), which is simply square root of power spectrum, in Figure 2. As we see, there is ample signal compared\u221ato idealised noise (here with baseline 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221213\ns\u22122 / Hz). This scenario gives an SNR of 35 and for\ncomparison a type I signal is presented giving an SNR\nof 28 - note the differences in the behaviour at low and\nhigh frequencies. The larger SNR here stems from the\nPoisson equation being linear in \u2207\u03c6 and hence there are\nno associated curl forces (which generally exist in nonlinear theories). These will produce a softening of the\ntidal stress divergence, since this is not present here, we\nfind a larger signal. We produce in Figure 3 contours for\ntypical SNRs produced at various impact parameters and\nbaseline noises, as well as present a comparison of contours from different theories - observing that type IIB\nbeats type I on SNR. As Figure 2 shows, the position of\nthe signal in fourier space is exactly where noise is lowest. This highlights an uncanny coincidence, given that\nthe accelerometer aboard LPF has a non-white noise profile, dipping in the region of the mHz (on the rough time\nscale of minutes). The motivation for such a design lies\nin the gravitational wave signals to be targeted by LISA it just happens that the MONDian bubbles of anomalous\ntidal stresses around the Earth-Sun-Moon saddles are of\nlength scale \u223c 103 km and free-falling bodies around this\nregion have a typical speed of \u223c 1 km s\u22121 .

With an\nappropriate noise model, SNRs \u2265 35 could be expected\nmissing the saddle by 50km or less (a larger figure than\nwould be expected from type I theories). The question\nthen arises as to how generic this conclusion is, or conversely, should a negative result be found what can be\nsaid about these theories. Predictions for what happens\ninside the bubble are found to be model independent,\nthe tidal stress anomalies outside the bubble however do\ndepend on the transient from the modified into the Newtonian regime, with a model dependent fall-off. Thus for\nimpact parameters smaller than r0 the predicted SNRs\n\nare robust and do not change substantially - the currently expected case is b \u2264 10 km (with r0 \u223c 383 km). A\nway therefore for such theories to wriggle out of a negative LPF result would be to change the bubble size.\nThis could be accomplished with a \"designer\" function\n- giving the free function two scales and two power-laws\nbefore reaching the rescaled Newtonian regime. Furthermore the effects inside the bubble are different from type\nI predictions, but generically stronger. This stems from\ntype II theories lack of curl field, a feature which appears\nto soften out the anomalous stresses. This results generically in larger SNRs between type I and IIB theories. As\nwe see applying the same arguments between the two theories results in different constraints and the bubble size\ngenerically being smaller here compared to type I for a\n\n\f7\nnull result. By considering a generalised approach to free\nfunctions, we find inner and outer bubble solutions and\nconsidered the scaling of the tidal stress with parameters\nextracted from the free functions. The main result being that in the DM regime, our angular profile functions\nbecome relatively invariant between models, making the\nprospect of extracting features of \u03bd from potential data\ninteresting - the main contribution being the radial parameter and its associated exponent. The divergence of\nthe tidal stresses scale much quicker for a given \u03bd(a, b)\ncompared to the corresponding \u03bc(a, b) models of type I\ntheories. These models suggest that tying a result to\neither type I or IIB theories is in principle viable - differentiating between the two theories is a realistic prospect,\nour imagination is only limited to the theories we develop.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe author would like to thank Jo\u00e3o Magueijo, Tim\nClifton, Johannes Noller and Dan Thomas for useful discussions and suggestions.

This is easiest seen when one attempts\nto linearize the non-linear Poisson equations present by\nintroducing an auxiliary vector field (e.g. \u03bc\u2207\u03c6 for type\nI theories) - such a field has non-zero curl. The same is\nnot true for type II theories, being already linear in \u03c6\nand driven by a function of the Newtonian field, \u03bd\u2207\u03a6N ,\n(a quantity which has a curl).

Whilst we stress this derivation is\nonly strictly valid for spherical symmetry, it remains a\ngood starting point for comparison between these theories.
