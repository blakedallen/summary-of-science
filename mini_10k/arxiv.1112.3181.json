These rates depend upon the spectroscopic properties of states in\n\nwithin about 1 MeV of the 26gAl+p threshold (Sp = 7463 keV). We have studied the\n\n28Si(3He,\u03b1)27Si\n\nreaction at 25 MeV using a high-resolution quadrupole-dipole-dipole-dipole\n\nmagnetic spectrograph. For the first time with a transfer reaction, we have constrained J\u03c0\nvalues for states in 27Si over Ex = 7.0 \u2013 8.1 MeV through angular distribution measurements.\nAside from a few important cases, we generally confirm the energies and spin-parity\nassignments reported in a recent \u03b3-ray spectroscopy study. The magnitudes of neutron\nspectroscopic factors determined from shell-model calculations are in reasonable agreement\nwith our experimental values extracted using this reaction.\n\nPACS: 21.10.Hw, 26.20.Cd, 25.55.Hp, 27.30.+t\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRadioactive nuclei produced in various astrophysical phenomena may \u03b2-decay to daughter\nnuclei in excited states, which subsequently de-excite through the emission of characteristic\n\u03b3-rays. The high penetrating power of \u03b3-rays permits direct translation of these observables\ninto abundances of the mother nuclei, which can then be used to constrain and test\n\n\f3\n\nnucleosynthesis predictions from stellar models. Obtaining absolute abundances using\nmeasurements from elsewhere in the electromagnetic spectrum generally requires additional,\npossibly speculative assumptions regarding the environments (e.g., stellar atmospheres)\nunder consideration; moreover, such observations generally only provide elemental (as\nopposed to isotopic) abundances. Since the 1.809 MeV \u03b2-delayed \u03b3-ray line from the decay of\nthe ground-state of 26Al (t1/2 = 7.2 \u00d7 105 y, J\u03c0 = 5+) is the most thoroughly examined case [1-7],\nits intensity and distribution within the Galaxy provides one of the most robust constraints\non nucleosynthesis predictions from theoretical models. Reproducing the inferred\nabundance of 26Al in the Galaxy (2.7 \u00b1 0.7 M\u0001 [7]) with a single model (or several models\naccounting for different nucleosynthesis sites) could have far-reaching consequences. For\nexample, 26Al is inferred to have been present in the early solar system to the level of 26Al/27Al\n~ 5 \u00d7 10-5 (from meteoritic inclusions, see e.g., [8]) and the energy released by its decay was\npartially responsible for the melting and differentiation of planetesimals (see e.g., [9,10]), the\nfirst large bodies to form in the solar system. Planetesimals may in turn have been the source\nof much of Earth's water [11, 12], so the habitability of our planet could be directly linked to\nthe stellar nucleosynthesis of 26Al.\n\nRadioisotopes such as 26Al and 60Fe are long-lived relative to the recurrence timescales of\nevents which create these isotopes. Complications in the interpretation of the \u03b3-ray\nobservations therefore arise because the detected intensities likely consist of the\nsuperposition of the emission from nuclei produced in different events, distributed in both\ntime and space. For example, the 3D spatial distribution of the sources must be determined\nto explain the observed flux. Complications in the relevant nuclear physics behind the net\nproduction of 26Al arise from the presence of an isomeric state in 26Al at Ex= 228 keV (t1/2 =\n6.3 s, J\u03c0= 0+). (Hereafter, the ground state of 26Al will be denoted as 26gAl, the isomeric state\nas 26mAl, and the general nucleus as simply 26Al.)\n\n26gAl\n\n\u03b2-decays to the Ex = 1.809 and 2.938\n\nMeV states in 26Mg, leading to a 1.809 MeV \u03b3-ray in 99.7% of all decays. The isomer, on the\nother hand, decays directly (100%) to the ground-state of 26Mg without the emission of any \u03b3-\n\n\f4\n\nray. Hence, one must distinguish between production and destruction of both 26gAl and 26mAl\nin astrophysical phenomena, particularly at temperatures T < 0.4 GK where thermal\nequilibrium between the ground and isomeric states is not assured [13 \u2013 16].\n\nStellar winds from Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, and ejection\nthrough core-collapse supernova and classical nova explosions have been suggested as\nmechanisms through which 26Al may be distributed throughout the interstellar medium [4, 6,\n16 \u2013 22]. Each of these scenarios involves different characteristic temperatures over which\n26Al\n\nis most likely to be produced or destroyed. As a result, nuclear structure information for\n\ndifferent nuclei, and over various excitation energies in these nuclei, is required to\ncharacterize all of the relevant thermonuclear reaction rates.\n\nIn hydrogen-burning environments, the 26Al(p,\u03b3)27Si reaction is the key pathway for the\ndestruction of 26Al. The winds of AGB and WR stars are thought to eject 26Al produced\nthrough hydrogen-burning at temperatures between roughly 30 \u2013 100 MK. In classical\nnovae, 26Al is produced only in explosions that involve an oxygen-neon white dwarf and\nachieve the highest temperatures, e.g., Tpeak \u2248 0.2 \u2013 0.4 GK. These considerations imply the\nneed to understand the nuclear structure of 27Si in the energy range between the 26gAl+p\nthreshold (Sp = 7462.96(16) keV [23]) and roughly 1 MeV above this threshold to reliably\nevaluate the 26gAl(p,\u03b3)27Si and 26mAl(p,\u03b3)27Si rates in all of these environments. In particular,\none requires the resonance energies ER and (p,\u03b3) resonance strengths for states in this energy\nrange. Unknown resonance strengths may be estimated using indirect techniques, for\nexample, using proton-transfer spectroscopic factors, proton and \u03b3-decay branching ratios\nand J\u03c0 values \u2013 see e.g., Iliadis (2007) [24] for more details.\n\nThe 26Al(p,\u03b3)27Si reaction has been studied both directly and indirectly. Buchmann et al.\n(1984) [25] measured an excitation function using protons bombarding a 26gAl target, and\nfound 7 resonances within ER = 270 - 900 keV (Ex = 7.74\u2013 8.36 MeV). They also used the\n\n\f5\n\nthick-target method to find the strengths of these resonances. Schmalbrock et al. (1986) [26]\nused the 28Si(3He,\u03b1)27Si reaction to determine the energies of 58 states from Ex = 4.14 \u2013 8.37\nMeV; 18 of these states had excitation energies greater than 7.46 MeV. These measurements\nwere largely confirmed by Wang et al. (1989) [27], who studied both the 27Al(3He,t)27Si and\n28Si(3He,\u03b1)27Si\n\nreactions. Both Schmalbrock et al. [26] and Wang et al. [27] attempted\n\nunsuccessfully to determine J\u03c0 values for proton-threshold states in 27Si through the\nmeasurement of angular distributions for the 28Si(3He,\u03b1)27Si reaction. Contaminant alpha\ngroups from (3He,\u03b1) reactions on carbon and oxygen were an issue in both studies; Wang et\nal. [27] nonetheless extracted angular distributions, but did not attempt to fit them. Vogelaar\net al. (1996) [28] measured the 26gAl(3He,d)27Si reaction to constrain strengths for states at Ex\n= 7.59, 7.65, and 7.74 MeV through estimates of the respective proton-transfer spectroscopic\nfactors. Ruiz et al. (2006) [29], through a direct study in inverse kinematics with a highintensity beam of 26gAl, measured both the energy and strength of the key resonance for 26gAl\ndestruction in classical nova explosions (ER = 184 keV, Ex = 7.65 MeV). Both the resonance\nenergy and strength, however, were in minor disagreement with the previous unpublished\ndirect study of Vogelaar (1989) [30] (but see section IV), and with the results from the\ntransfer reaction studies of [26] and [27]. Deibel et al. (2009) [31] observed 53 states\nbetween Ex = 8.14 and 9.86 MeV through studies of the 27Al(3He,t)27Si and 28Si(3He,\u03b1)27Si\nreactions. They also observed proton decays from excited states in 27Si between Ex = 8.14 \u2013\n8.98 MeV to the ground-, isomeric and second-excited states of 26Al, and so were able to\nconstrain the corresponding proton-branching ratios.\n\nOutstanding nuclear physics issues for 26Al destruction in AGB and WR stars and classical\nnova explosions included (a) 26gAl(p,\u03b3) resonance strengths (or spectroscopic information)\nfor states Ex(27Si) < 7.65 MeV; (b) the possible existence of the state at Ex(27Si) = 7.56 MeV\n(identified only in the studies of Wang et al. (1989) [27]); (c) the energy of the resonance at\nEx(27Si) = 7.65 MeV, given the \u22484 keV disagreement between the Ruiz et al. [29] study and\nthe other studies [26, 27, 30]. Points (a) and (b) are of particular relevance for 26Al\n\n\f6\n\nproduction in AGB and WR stars as they gave rise to uncertainties of \u22484 orders of magnitude\nin the 26gAl(p,\u03b3)27Si destruction rate over the temperatures involved [32], which, in turn,\ncould affect 26Al production in e.g., AGB stars by factors of \u2248100 [33, 34]. Point (c) is of\nimportance to precisely quantify 26Al production in classical novae (expected to contribute\nless than 20% of the overall Galactic 26Al abundance [22, 35]). The contribution to a\nthermonuclear rate of a narrow, isolated resonance depends linearly on the strength of the\nresonance and exponentially on the resonance energy ER through a factor exp(-ER/kT), where\nT is the temperature of interest and k is the Boltzmann constant. An uncertainty of 4 keV in\nER leads to an uncertainty of \u224820% in the contribution of this resonance to the overall\n26gAl(p,\u03b3)27Si\n\nrate at typical nova peak temperatures (over which this resonance dominates\n\nthe reaction rate). This uncertainty is comparable to the uncertainties in measurements of\nthe strength of this resonance [29, 30]. Moreover, a reduction in the 26gAl(p,\u03b3)27Si rate by\n\u224820% led to an increase in the overall yield of 26Al by \u224820% in the nova model discussed in\n[29]. Finally, in addition to the above, a reliable 26mAl(p,\u03b3)27Si rate would require resonance\nstrengths (or complete spectroscopic information) for states between Ex = 7.69 MeV (i.e., the\n26mAl+p\n\nenergy threshold in 27Si) and at least Ex = 8.14 MeV (above which proton branching\n\nratios to the ground and isomeric states have been measured [31]).\n\nLotay et al. [36] addressed some of these issues through a detailed \u03b3-ray spectroscopy study\nof 27Si using the fusion-evaporation reaction 12C(16O,n). J\u03c0 values were assigned for levels\nbetween the ground state and Ex = 8.38 MeV. No state at 7.56 MeV was observed, and the\nexcitation energy of the 7.65 MeV state was found to be in disagreement with the value from\n[29]. With this new information, a 26gAl(p,\u03b3)27Si rate was recently determined with\nuncertainties of less than a factor 10 below 0.1 GK, and less than \u224820% above 0.1 GK [37]. A\nreliable 26mAl(p,\u03b3)27Si rate still cannot be calculated, however, due to insufficient\nexperimental information [16].\n\n\f7\n\nThe structure of 27Si within about 1 MeV of the 26gAl+p threshold is of clear importance in\nconstraining the 26gAl(p,\u03b3) and 26mAl(p,\u03b3) rates in hydrogen-burning environments such as\nAGB and WR stars and classical nova explosions. Given this, we have performed a highresolution study of the 28Si(3He,\u03b1)27Si reaction to independently determine the energies and\nJ\u03c0 values for relevant states in 27Si. We also desired to test the assertion of Wang et al. (1989)\n[27] that reliable J\u03c0 values could not be extracted from angular distributions of the\n28Si(3He,\u03b1)27Si\n\nII.\n\nreaction at E \u2248 22 MeV, for states above the 26gAl+p energy threshold in 27Si.\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nThe 28Si(3He,\u03b1)27Si reaction was measured at the Maier-Leibnitz-Laboratorium (MLL) in\nGarching, Germany over a total period of three days. A 25 MeV beam of 3He2+ ions (I \u2248 550\nnA) was produced with an electron-cyclotron-resonance-like ion source [38] and an MP\ntandem accelerator. This beam was transported to the target position of a quadrupoledipole-dipole-dipole (Q3D) magnetic spectrograph with superior intrinsic energy resolution\n\u2206E/E \u2248 2 \u00d7 10-4 [39]. Targets were prepared at the Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, and\nincluded: enriched silicon (20 \u03bcg/cm2, enriched to 99.84% 28Si) deposited upon a foil of\nenriched carbon (7 \u03bcg/cm2, enriched to 99.99% 12C); natural silicon dioxide (self-supporting,\n25 \u03bcg/cm2); enriched carbon (10 \u03bcg/cm2 foil, enriched to 99.99% 12C); and enriched\nmagnesium (20 \u03bcg/cm2, enriched to 99.92 % 24Mg) deposited upon a foil of enriched carbon\n(7 \u03bcg/cm2, enriched to 99.99 % 12C). The carbon and silicon dioxide targets were used\nprimarily to characterize background due to reactions on the carbon and oxygen present in\nthe enriched silicon target, and the magnesium target was used to help calibrate the focalplane of the spectrograph. Light reaction products entered the Q3D spectrograph through a\nrectangular aperture (encompassing 7.0 msr), were dispersed according to their momenta,\nand finally, were focused onto a multi-wire gas-filled proportional counter backed by a plastic\nscintillator [40]. Alpha particles were clearly identified through energy loss and residual\nenergy information from the focal-plane detection system, and alpha spectra of focal-plane\n\n\f8\n\nposition were then produced. Measurements were made at spectrograph angles of 10, 15, 20,\n25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 55, and 65\u00b0; the beam current was integrated using a Faraday cup placed\nat 0\u00b0 in the target chamber.\n\nIII.\n\nDATA AND ANALYSIS\n\nFig. 1 shows alpha spectra measured with the enriched silicon target at spectrograph angles\nof 15\u00b0 and 20\u00b0. Contaminant groups due to (3He,\u03b1) reactions on 12C and 16O present in the\ntarget (the former primarily from the target backing) were evident, and these were\nunambiguously identified and characterized through both kinematic analysis at the measured\nangles and measurements with the enriched carbon and silicon dioxide targets. For example,\ncontaminant groups due to 16O(3He,\u03b1) reactions populating the 8743(6), 8922(2) and\n8982.1(17) keV states in 15O [41] are seen among the 7380, 7534, 7592 and 7652 keV states of\n27Si\n\nin Fig. 1a and among the 7534, 7652, 7694, 7704 and 7740 keV states of 27Si in Fig. 1b.\n\nThese spectra were analyzed using least-squares fits of multiple Gaussian or exponentiallymodified Gaussian functions. Consistent excitation energies were determined using each of\nthese prescriptions. Peak widths were fixed to \u224812 keV FWHM based on fits of isolated peaks\nin these spectra.\n\nAt each measurement angle the focal-plane was calibrated using well-resolved, known states\nin 23Mg (7.6 < Ex(23Mg) < 8.7 MeV and \u2206Ex = 1 \u2013 6 keV [42, 43]) populated via the\n24Mg(3He,\u03b1)\n\nreaction with the enriched magnesium target. With this information, second-\n\ndegree polynomial fits of alpha radius of curvature \u03c1 to focal-plane position yielded excitation\nenergies for states in 27Si. Excitation energies from the present work are listed in Table I,\nalong with uncertainties due to counting statistics, reproducibility among angles, and\nuncertainties in the calibration states; the slightly larger uncertainties for states with Ex > 7.9\nMeV arise due to the increasing reliance on calibration states with larger uncertainties. The\nenergies from the present work are all weighted averages calculated with energies determined\n\n\f9\n\nfor at least four different angles \u2013 the exact number depended upon the precise magnetic\nfield setting used at a particular angle (i.e., for states near the edges of the focal-plane), the\npresence of large contaminant peaks obscuring different states at different angles, and the\nrequirement that a 27Si state lie within a region spanned entirely by calibration peaks. As\nwell, we note a systematic uncertainty of \u00b1 2 keV due to uncertainty in the thicknesses of the\nenriched silicon and enriched magnesium targets (each target thickness is known to roughly\n10%) and uncertainty in the relative Q-value of the 28Si(3He,\u03b1)27Si and 24Mg(3He,\u03b1)23Mg\nreactions (this last aspect is dominated by the 0.8 keV uncertainty in the mass of 23Mg [23,\n44]).\n\nAngular distributions measured using the 28Si(3He,\u03b1)27Si reaction are plotted in Fig. 2, along\nwith direct reaction calculations using the code FRESCO [45]. Only well-resolved singlet\nstates clearly observed over at least five angles are included in Fig. 2. Optical model\nparameters for the calculations were obtained using global scaling formulas [46] for the\nincoming 28Si + 3He channel. For the outgoing channel, parameters were taken from a study\nof the elastic scattering of alpha particles on the isobar 27Al at the same incident energy [47].\nThe shapes of the corresponding angular distribution calculations were found to be\ninsensitive to modest variations of these optical model parameters. A further improvement\nwas made through the consideration of inelastic excitations to the 21+ state in 28Si. This\nimproves the agreement between the calculations and the experimental data at large angles\nand generally reduces the amplitudes of the oscillations in the differential cross sections, but\ndoes not influence the extracted angular momentum transfers L. As in all one-particle\ntransfer reactions, the shape of the angular distribution is insensitive to the spin J of the final\nstate, and so only the angular momentum transfer L can be determined. This allows one to\ndetermine the parity of states populated in the reaction, making our results completely\ncomplementary to those from the \u03b3-ray spectroscopy measurement of [36]. In that\nmeasurement, \u03b3-ray branching ratios and angular distributions were used to determine the\n\u2206I of \u03b3-ray transitions, which were then used to assign spins to excited states of 27Si; the\n\n\f10\n\ncorresponding parities of the states were inferred largely (but not exclusively) through\ncomparisons with states in the mirror nucleus 27Al.\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn Table I we compare results from the present study to previous studies of the structure of\n27Si\n\nbetween Ex = 7.0 \u2013 8.1 MeV. We include in Table I energies for peaks observed in the\n\npresent work that may coincide with previously-identified doublets. For example, the peak at\n7.074 MeV in the present work was observed with a somewhat larger width than other,\nisolated states, and, falls between the 7.059 and 7.080 MeV states determined in the study of\n[26]. Similar considerations apply for the 7.334, 7.434 and 7.699 MeV peaks observed in the\npresent work; note, however that the 7.074 and 7.434 MeV peaks coincide with single states\nobserved in [36]. Attempts to analyze these peaks as unresolved doublets did not produce\nsignificant improvements over single-level fits. As well, no appreciable changes in the shapes\nof these peaks as a function of angle were observed.\n\nEnergies determined in the present study generally agree well with values from previous\nmeasurements. The observation of states at 7.25 MeV [36] and 7.26 MeV (present work and\n[26]) indicate the existence of a previously-unidentified doublet. We do not observe a state at\n7.49 MeV nor at 7.56 MeV (tentatively identified in the studies of [36] and [27], respectively).\nFor the state at 7.65 MeV, our energy is in agreement with the values from the previous\ntransfer-reaction and \u03b3-ray spectroscopy measurements [26, 27, 36]. The discrepancy\nbetween this energy and that from the radiative proton-capture measurement of [29] could\npossibly be explained by the excitation of different members of a closely-spaced doublet in\n27Si\n\nby the different experiments. Support for this hypothesis comes from the different \u03b3-\n\ndecay schemes reported for this state by [36] and in the unpublished proton-capture\nmeasurement of Vogelaar [30] \u2013 see [48] for more details. As well, the resonance energy\ndetermined in [30] (Ep = 195.6(11) keV, Ex = 7651.3(11) keV) may need to be reduced by a few\n\n\f11\n\nkeV due to an adjustment in the energy of a calibration state; this would improve the accord\nbetween the energies determined from the two proton-capture studies [29, 30].\nMeasurements are in progress to explore this issue further [49]. A previously-unresolved\ndoublet of states at 7.832 and 7.838 MeV was observed for the first time by [36]; we could not\nresolve these two states, but we do note that our energy for this doublet (7.831 MeV) indicates\nthe weak relative population of the higher-energy member at all angles. Finally, the presence\nof a previously-unknown doublet seems required by the observation of a state at 7.890(2)\nMeV (in the present study) and a state at 7.8990(8) MeV (in the study of [36]).\n\nIn Table I we have listed spin-parity constraints from the present work that arise directly\nfrom our measured angular distributions \u2013 we have not appealed to any tentative mirror\nassignments (e.g., those suggested by [36]). Except for the assignments to the states at 7.00,\n7.13, 7.91, 8.03 and 8.07 MeV, all of our constraints are compatible with the J\u03c0 values\nassigned in [36]. Calculated angular distributions for L values corresponding to the best-fit\ncases as well as those values deduced from [36] are plotted in Fig. 2 for the three states above\nthe 26gAl+p threshold; the experimental data at low angles in particular favours our J\u03c0\nconstraints. The disagreement in assigned parity for the 7.00 and 8.07 MeV states may arise\nfrom incorrect mirror assignments in [36].\n\nMeasured angular distributions from the 28Si(3He,\u03b1)27Si reaction have been published\npreviously for the 7.47, 7.53, 7.59 and 7.65 MeV states by Wang et al. [27]. Although a similar\nbeam energy was employed in that study, the angular range was limited to \u03b8cm less than \u224835\u00b0\nfor these four states. The authors expressed the lack of easily discernible direct reaction\ncharacteristics for their angular distributions and thus did not extract spin and parity\ninformation. In contrast, our measured angular distributions show characteristic features\nmainly because the angular range has been significantly extended (up to \u03b8cm = 72\u00b0 for these\nstates). The relative cross-sections agree quite well between the present study and that of\n[27], although absolute values differ by a factor of \u22483 for common angles. The source of this\n\n\f12\n\ndiscrepancy is not understood \u2013 the slight increase in beam energy (22.4 MeV in Wang et al.\n[27], versus 25 MeV in the present study) does not account for such differences. The general\ngood agreement between our J\u03c0 constraints and those from the \u03b3-ray study of [36] indicate\nthat treating the neutron-removal 28Si(3He,\u03b1) process as a direct reaction at these energies is\nreasonable.\n\nAssignments between analogue states in 27Si and 27Al have been extensively discussed in\nLotay et al. [36], and were indeed exploited by necessity to extract many of their adopted\nparities for states in 27Si. To facilitate the comparison between observed states in 27Si and\nshell model calculations, we have determined experimental neutron-removal spectroscopic\nfactors S for the population of the 27Si states shown in Fig. 2, where S is the ratio between the\nexperimental and calculated differential cross-section for a state. (Note that these neutronremoval spectroscopic factors from the 28Si(3He,\u03b1) reaction are not of interest for calculations\nof the thermonuclear 26Al(p,\u03b3)27Si rate. For such applications we would require protontransfer spectroscopic factors, which could be determined through measurement of e.g., the\n26Al(3He,d)27Si\n\nreaction \u2013 see [28].) Theoretical energy levels and neutron spectroscopic\n\nfactors were calculated in the shell-model using the code OXBASH [50]. Within the model\nspace of the USDA interaction [51] only states with J\u03c0 = {1/2+, 3/2+, 5/2+} are expected to be\npopulated in the one-neutron removal reaction. In Fig. 3 we compare the experimental\nspectroscopic factors for these low-spin states to the calculated values; the experimental\nvalues are also tabulated in Table II. Over Ex(27Si) = 6.9 \u2013 8.3 MeV, the calculated\nspectroscopic factors for these levels vary between about 0.001 and 0.01, as may be expected\nfor such high excitation energies. Given the discussion above on the disagreement between\nthe absolute cross-sections of the present measurement and those of Wang et al. [27], one\nshould consider a systematic uncertainty of a factor \u22483 in the experimental values of S. As\nwell, for states without a definite spin-parity assignment, or where our J\u03c0 constraints disagree\nwith the assignments of Lotay et al. [36] (see Table 1), we have adopted the calculations with\nthe higher spins when extracting the experimental spectroscopic factors. This affects the\n\n\f13\n\nexperimental value of S by e.g., 30% when comparing S values determined with J\u03c0 = 3/2+\nversus J\u03c0 = 5/2+ for the state at Ex = 7134 keV. From Fig. 3, we see that although the general\nagreement between the magnitudes of the experimental and calculated spectroscopic factors\nis acceptable, the direct assignment of experimental states to shell-model states is not\nstraightforward. This is due to the high density of observed states as well as the fact that\nfewer low-spin states are predicted in this energy region than have been observed (see Table I\n\u2013 only states that were well-resolved in the present set of measurements are included in Fig.\n3). We note, however, that significant progress has been made in this regard by Lotay et al.\n[36] through concurrent \u03b3-ray spectroscopy studies of 27Al and 27Si.\n\nThe structure of 27Si above the 26gA+p threshold (7463 keV) and the 26mAl+p threshold (7691\nkeV) is required to calculate thermonuclear rates for proton-capture on the ground and\nisomeric states of 26Al. We do not observe a state at 7.56 MeV, and the energy we determine\nfor a state at 7.65 MeV is consistent with the measurements of [26, 27, 36] (and inconsistent\nwith the energy from the study of [29]). Comparison between the constraints of the present\nstudy and [36] indicate that the 7.47 MeV state has J\u03c0 = 5/2+. Given these considerations, as\nwell as our agreement with the J\u03c0 values of [36] for the 7.53 and 7.59 MeV states, we propose\nno changes to the thermonuclear 26gAl(p,\u03b3)27Si rate determined in the recent evaluation of\n[37] over temperatures relevant to hydrogen-burning in AGB and WR stars and classical nova\nexplosions. It is still not possible to calculate a reliable experimental 26mAl(p,\u03b3)27Si rate [16]\nbecause of the lack of resonance strength (or proton spectroscopic factor) measurements for\nstates immediately above the 26mAl+p threshold. The spin-parities of these states as\ndetermined in the present work and that of [36] therefore represent critical information\nneeded both for rate estimates and to guide future experimental investigations dedicated to\nimproving the 26mAl(p,\u03b3) rate. Indeed, Lotay et al. [36] express the importance of the 8.07\nMeV state given their J\u03c0 assignment of 3/2- (corresponding to an l = 1 proton-capture\nresonance). Our data, however, is consistent with a different assignment for both the 8.07\nMeV state (i.e., corresponding to an l = 2 resonance) and the 7.91 MeV state (i.e.,\n\n\f14\n\ncorresponding to an l = 1 resonance). This would shift the importance of the l = 1 resonance\ndown to lower temperatures, where it could dominate the reaction rate [36]. Without more\nnuclear structure information however, it is impossible at the moment to precisely quantify\nthe contributions of individual resonances to the 26mAl(p,\u03b3) rate at temperatures involved in\nAGB and WR stars and classical nova explosions. The existence of additional states beyond\nthose in Table I should also be investigated.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have measured energies and angular distributions for states in 27Si over Ex = 7.0 \u2013 8.1\nMeV through a study of the 28Si(3He,\u03b1) reaction. Constraints on J\u03c0 values for sixteen states\nabove the 26gAl+p threshold have been determined for the first time using a transfer reaction;\nthese constraints (and all energies) are generally in good agreement with the results from a\nrecent \u03b3-ray spectroscopy study [36]. A direct reaction mechanism adequately describes our\nexperimental angular distributions, in contrast with indications from a previous\nmeasurement using the same reaction and similar beam energy [27].\n\nIn the absence of measured resonance strengths for states immediately above the 26gAl+p and\n26mAl+p\n\nenergy thresholds, the J\u03c0 values of these states represent critical nuclear structure\n\ninformation needed to estimate the corresponding thermonuclear proton-capture reaction\nrates. The present work confirms the assumptions made in the calculation of [37] for the\n26gAl(p,\u03b3)27Si\n\nrate. To further reduce the uncertainties in this rate, especially over\n\ntemperatures encountered in AGB and WR stars and classical nova explosions, the\n26Al(3He,d)27Si\n\nreaction should be studied to extract proton spectroscopic factors for the 7.53\n\nand 7.59 MeV states. A vital improvement over the previous study of this reaction [28] would\ninvolve the minimization of any 27Al contamination in the target [52]. Measurements to\nbetter constrain the 26mAl(p,\u03b3)27Si rate could involve a study similar to that of [31], optimized\nto allow the detection of protons from the decay of states Ex(27Si) < 8.1 MeV. The reaction\n\n\f15\n\ncould also be measured directly in inverse kinematics [53]; prior identification of l = 0 and l =\n1 resonances would help to guide this challenging study. For this reason, the J\u03c0 values of\nstates above the 26mAl+p threshold, particularly those at 7.91 and 8.07 MeV, should be\nconfirmed.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nIt is a pleasure to thank the crew of the MLL tandem accelerator.
