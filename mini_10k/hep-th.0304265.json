Dirac\n\nOne hundred years after its creator's birth, the Dirac equation stands as the\ncornerstone of XXth Century physics. But it is much more, as it carries the seeds\nof supersymmetry. Dirac also invented the light-cone, or \"front form\" dynamics,\nwhich plays a crucial role in string theory and in elucidating the finiteness of\nN = 4 Yang-Mills theory. The light-cone structure of eleven-dimensional supergravity (N = 8 supergravity in four dimensions) suggests a group-theoretical\ninterpretation of its divergences. We speculate they could be compensated by\nan infinite number of triplets of massless higher spin fields, each obeying a\nDirac-like equation associated with the coset F4 /SO(9). The divergences are\nproportional to the trace over a non-compact structure containing the compact\nform of F4 . Its nature is still unknown, but it could show the way to M -theory.\n\n1\n\nDirac's equation\n\nMuch of modern physics starts with the Dirac equation. Its deceptively simple\nform\n\u03b3 \u03b1 p\u03b1 \u03a8 = p\n/ \u03a8 = 0,\n\n(1)\n\nobscured the significance of the simple algebraic relation for its anticommutator\n{p\n/, p\n/ } = p2 .\n\n(2)\n\nToday we understand this as the seed of supersymmetry, which could be called\nprotosupersymmetry. In the context of string models, this relation turned out to\nbe very potent. There, the momentum was generalized to a momentum density\nalong the string\nP \u03b1 (\u03c3) = p\u03b1 + oscillators ,\n\n(3)\n\nsuggesting that the momentum operator is the average of the momentum density\np\u03b1 = < P \u03b1 > .\n\n1\n\n(4)\n\n\fIf we assume that the Dirac matrices are themselves like dynamical variables\n(as envisioned by the Master himself[1])\n\u0393\u03b1 (\u03c3) = \u03b3 \u03b1 + oscillators ,\n\n(5)\n\n\u03b3 \u03b1 = < \u0393\u03b1 > ,\n\n(6)\n\nwith\n\nit is not unnatural[2] to expect that\n\u03b3 \u03b1 p\u03b1 = < \u0393\u03b1 > < P\u03b1 >\n\n\u2192\n\n< \u0393\u03b1 P\u03b1 > ,\n\nwhich generalizes the Dirac equation to the string. If we write\nX\n\u0393\u03b1 (\u03c3) P\u03b1 (\u03c3) =\nFn ein\u03c3 ,\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nn\n\nwe find the superVirasoro algebra\n{ Fn , Fm } =\n[ Ln , Fm ] =\n[ Ln , Lm ] =\n\n2 Ln+m ,\n(2n \u2212 m) Fn+m ,\n(n \u2212 m) Ln+m .\n\n(9)\n\nWe should have read another of Dirac's papers[3]on the importance of c\u2212numbers,\nwhich were found later by the late Joe Weiss. The rest is history as this algebra\nopened the Pandora box of theories with bosons and fermions, which we call\nsupersymmetric.\n\n2\n\nDivergences and Group Theory\n\nIt is well-known how the running of the couplings in local field theory is related\nto the divergent part of some diagrams. For example, the one-loop beta function\nis given by\n\u03b2 =\n\n11 (2) 2 (2) 1 (2)\nI \u2212 I \u2212 IH ,\n3 adj 3 f\n3\n\n(10)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the Iadj, f, H are the quadratic Dynkin indices associated with the adjoint\n(for the gauge bosons), with spin one-half Weyl fermions, and with complex spin\nzero fields, respectively. These \"external\" group theoretical factors are given by\nTr (TrA TrB ) = Ir(2) \u03b4 AB ,\n\n(11)\n\nwher A, B run over the gauge group, and TrA are the representation matrices in\nthe r representation. The other numerical factors stem from group theory of the\n\"internal\" space. As shown by Hughes[4], they can be understood for massless\nparticles as,\n2\n\n\f1\n(1 \u2212 12h2 ) ,\n(12)\n3\nwhere h is the helicity of the particle circulating around the loop. In some sense\nthe square of the helicity can be viewed as the quadratic Dynkin index of the\nlight-cone[5] spin group, although in four dimensions, it is only SO(2), which is\nnot much of a group.\nCurtright[6] generalized this notion when he considered loop integrals coming\nfrom theories in higher dimensions, where the spin light-cone little group is\nmore substantial. For instance, the one loop vacuum polarization in N = 4\nYang-Mills can be obtained directly in ten dimensions where the little group is\nSO(8). Evaluate the loop integrals in four dimensions. The divergent part is\nproportional to\n(\u22121)f\n\n\u00101\n3\n\n(4) 2\nI (0) (\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd\nq \u2212 q\u03bc q\u03bd ) \u2212\n\n\u0011\n4 (2) (D) 2\nI (\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd q \u2212 q\u03bc q\u03bd ) ,\nr\n\n(13)\n\nwhere I (0) is the dimension of the transverse little group representation, r its\nrank, and I (2) is the quadratic Dynkin index of the same. In the case of N = 4\nYang Mills, we have D = 10 and the transverse little group is SO(8). With\nits triality property, the group theoretical factors are the same for bosons and\nfermions. This is the genesis of the cancellation of ultraviolet divergences for\nthat theory. It is the peculiar properties of the transverse little group that leads\nto ultraviolet finiteness[7], together with supersymmetry in the form of equality\nof fermions and bosons. This is true for all higher order Dynkin indices as well:\nsince SO(8) has rank four, it has three more independent Dynkin indices, of\norder 4, 6, and 8, which are the same for bosons and fermions by triality. No\nother group has that property.\nThis is puzzling since all string theories stem from eleven-dimensional M theory. The little group there is SO(9), a totally unremarkable group, or so\nit seems. In eleven dimensions, supergravity is described by three fields[8], the\ngraviton h\u03bc\u03bd , a Rarita-Schwinger fermion \u03c8\u03bc and a three-form boson A\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 .\nTheir physical degrees of freedom fall in three SO(9) representations whose\ngroup-theoretical properties are summarized in the following table:\nField\nirrep\nI (0)\nI (2)\nI (4)\nI (6)\nI (8)\n\n\u03a8i\n(1001)\n128\n256\n640\n1792\n5248\n\nhij\n(2000)\n44\n88\n232\n712\n2440\n\nAijk\n(0010)\n84\n168\n408\n1080\n3000\n\nThe Dynkin indices have the remarkable property that they cancel between\nfermions and bosons\n\n3\n\n\f(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nI128 \u2212 I44 \u2212 I84 = 0 , k = 0, 2, 4, 6 ,\n\n(14)\n\nexcept for the highest invariant\n(8)\n\n(8)\n\n(8)\n\nI128 \u2212 I44 \u2212 I84 = \u2212 192 .\n\n(15)\n\nThis led Curtright to speculate that the theory is divergent because of this inequality. The lowest order divergent diagram that contains the eighth-order\ninvariant is a three-loop four-graviton amplitude. While it is hopeless to calculate such a beast, this is the diagram for which there appears to be no local\ncounterterm[9].\n\n3\n\nEuler Triplets\n\nSometime ago, it was found[10] that this pattern of group-theoretical partial\ncancellations among three representations generalized to other SO(9) representations.\nThere are three equivalent embeddings of SO(9) inside the exceptional group\nF4 , much like the I- U- and V-spins for the embedding of SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) inside\nSU (3). As a result, one can associate with each F4 representation three SO(9)\nrepresentations, whose properties are summarized in the character formula[11]\nX\nV\u03bb \u2297 S + \u2212 V\u03bb \u2297 S \u2212 =\nsgn(c) Uc\u2022\u03bb .\n(16)\nc\n\nOn the left-hand side, V\u03bb is a representation of F4 written in terms of its SO(9)\nsubgroup, S \u00b1 are the two spinor representations of SO(16) written in terms of its\nanomalously embedded subgroup SO(9), and \u2297 denotes the normal Kronecker\nproduct of representations. On the right-hand side, the sum is over c, the three\nelements of the Weyl group which map the Weyl chamber of F4 into the (three\ntimes larger) chamber of SO(9). Finally Uc\u2022\u03bb denotes the SO(9) representation\nwith highest Dynkin weight c \u2022 \u03bb, where\nc \u2022 \u03bb = c (\u03bb + \u03c1F4 ) \u2212 \u03c1SO(9) ,\nand \u03c1's are the sum of the fundamental weights for each group, and sgn(c) is\nthe index of c. Thus to each F4 representation corresponds a triplet, called\nEuler triplet. The three representations of supergravity appear in the trivial\ncase associated with the singlet of F4 . Since\nSO(16) \u2283 SO(9) ,\n\nS + \u223c 128 = 128 ,\n\nS \u2212 \u223c 128\u2032 = 44 + 84 ,\n\nthe character formula reduces to\n128 \u2212 44 \u2212 84 = 128 \u2212 44 \u2212 84 .\n4\n\n\fIn general, the representations describe (in light-cone variables) fields with spin\ngreater than two. For each F4 representation with Dynkin labels [ a1 a2 a3 a4 ]\none obtains three SO(9) representations listed in order of increasing dimensions:\n(2+a2 +a3 +a4 , a1 , a2 , a3 ) , (a2 , a1 , 1+a2 +a3 , a4 ) , (1+a2 +a3 , a1 , a2 , 1+a3 +a4 )\nFor spinor representations, the fourth entry is an odd integer. Euler triplets for\nwhich the largest representation is the spinor have equal number of fermions\nand bosons; this occurs whenever both a3 and a4 are even integers or zero.\n\n4\n\nKostant Equation\n\nWe find here again the long hand of Dirac, for the minus sign in the character\nformula suggests that it is the index formula for a Dirac-like operator. This is\nKostant's operator[12] associated with the coset F4 /SO(9). The Clifford algebra\nover this coset\n{ \u0393a , \u0393b } = 2 \u03b4 ab , a, b = 1, 2, . . . , 16 ,\n\n(17)\n\nis generated by (256 \u00d7 256) matrices, and the Kostant equation is defined as\nK\n/\u03a8 =\n\n16\nX\n\n\u0393a T a \u03a8 = 0 ,\n\n(18)\n\na=1\n\nwhere Ta are the F4 generators not in SO(9), with commutation relations\n[ T a , T b ] = i f ab ij T ij .\n\n(19)\n\nThese are conveniently expressed in terms of copies of 26 oscillators with the\n[s]\n[s]\n[s]\nusual Bose-like commutation relations[13]: A0 , Ai , i = 1, * * * , 9, Ba , a =\n1, * * * , 16, and their hermitian conjugates, and where s = 1, 2, 3. Under SO(9),\n[s]\n[s]\n[s]\nthe Ai transform as 9, Ba transform as 16, and A0 is a scalar. Note that\n[s]\nthe Ba satisfy Bose-like commutation relations, even though they are SO(9)\nspinors. The F4 generators are then\n\nTij\nTa\n\n= \u2212i\n= \u2212\n\n4 \u001a\u0010\nX\ns=1\n4 n\nX\n\ni\n2\n\ns=1\n\n[s]\u2020 [s]\nAi Aj\n\n\u2212\n\n[s]\u2020] [s]\nAj Ai\n\n\u0011\n\n1\n+ B [s]\u2020 \u03b3ij B [s]\n2\n\n\u001b\n\n,\n\n\u0011o\n\u0011 \u221a \u0010\n\u0010\n[s]\n[s]\u2020\n[s]\u2020 [s]\n[s]\u2020 [s]\n.\n(\u03b3i )ab Ai Bb \u2212 Bb Ai \u2212 3 Ba[s]\u2020 A0 \u2212 A0 Ba[s]\n\nOne can just as easily have used the coordinate representation of the oscillators\nby introducing real coordinates ui which transform as transverse space vectors,\nu0 as scalars, and \u03b6a as the space spinors. It is amusing to note that the internal\n\n5\n\n\fcordinates span three exceptional Jordan algebras, which have been the subject\nof much interest as possible charge spaces.\nThe solutions of Kostant's equation are then simply described by a chiral\nsuperfield[14]. Listing only its highest weight components, it is of the form\n\u03a6~a = \u03b81 \u03b88 h(y \u2212 , ~x, ui , \u03b6a ) + \u03b81 \u03b84 \u03b88 \u03c8(y \u2212 , ~x, ui , \u03b6a ) + \u03b81 \u03b84 \u03b85 \u03b88 A(y \u2212 , ~x, ui , \u03b6a ) .\n(20)\nThe three fields are polynomials in three sets of \"internal\" bosonic coordinates.\nA possible violation of the spin-statistics connection is avoided when the fields\nare even functions of the \u03b6a . This happens whenever a3 and a4 are even, but this\nis the case where each Euler triplet contains as many fermions as bosons. Hence\nthere is an intriguing relation in this solution space between spin-statistics and\nequality between bosons and fermions. Supergravity is the trivial solution for\nwhich the three fields h , A , and \u03c8 are independent of the internal coordinates.\n\n5\n\nA Zero Sum Game\n\nSince the Dynkin indices of the product of two representations satisfy the composition law\nI (n) [\u03bb \u2297 \u03bc] = d\u03bb I (n) [\u03bc] + d\u03bc I (n) [\u03bb] ,\nwhere d is the dimension, it follows that the deficit in I (8) is always proportional\nto\n(8)\n\n(8)\n\nd\u03bb (IS + \u2212 IS \u2212 ) ,\nwhere d\u03bb is the dimension of the F4 representation that generates it. It is always\nof the same sign, so cancellation, if it happens will come only after summing\nover an infinite number of triplets.\nEach triplet contains particles with spin greater than two. As we have\nshown[14], they cannot have mass since they do not assemble in massive little\ngroup multiplets. The only evasion route from the well documented difficulties [15] with higher spin massless fields interacting with gravity theories is to\nallow for an infinite number, but to this date no such theory has been put forth,\nperhaps with good reason.\nIf indeed the divergences of supergravity all stem from the deficit in the\neighth order Dynkin, we are led to the bizarre equation\nX\n(21)\ndF4 (a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 ) = 0 ,\n\u2206 I (8) = \u2212 192\na1 ,a2 ,a3 ,a4\n\nwhere dF4 (a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 ) is the dimension of the F4 representation with Dynkin\nlabels [ a1 a2 a3 a4 ]. It can only vanish if the sum is over an infinite number of\nrepresentations. In order to make sense of this at least two obstacles have to be\n\n6\n\n\fsurmounted. One is to specify the regularization procedure, and the second is\nto determine the subset of F4 representations over which to take the sum.\nWe seek an algebraic structure which contains an infinite number of F4\nrepresentations such that the (regulated) trace, or character, over the dimensions\nof these representations is zero. It would be wonderful if the triality properties\n(1)\nof affine E6 somehow became important. In quantum groups, zero traces can\noccur when the q parameter is a root of unity1 , so we are perhaps dealing with\nsuch an object. At any rate, it will be a miracle if such a structure exists, but\nthen we are looking for a unique theory where miracles are expected on a daily\nbasis.\nDimensions of F4 representations are expressed as 24th order polynomials\nin their Dynkin indices. A zero-sum game can be clearly set up: assuming \u03b6function regularization, or a quantum group, find a subset of F4 representations\nwith zero total dimension. The existence of such a set would be strong indication\nfor a finite structure underlying eleven-dimensional supergravity.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI wish to thank Professor H.
