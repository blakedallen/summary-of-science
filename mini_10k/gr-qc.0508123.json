The first results were obtained by Abraham [1] for a non-relativistic\nnon-spinning rigid sphere. This calculation was later repeated by Schott [2] and Lorentz [3] within special relativity,\nand by Crowley and Nodvik [4] in general (background) spacetimes. Similar results have since been obtained by a\nnumber of authors for more general charge distributions [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] in flat spacetime. These results have\nvery recently been extended to curved backgrounds as well [39]. Still, these derivations did not allow for significant\nelasticity, charge-current coupling, and/or rotation.\nDetailed reviews of different aspects of the self-force problem (in electromagnetism as well as scalar field theory and\ngeneral relativity) have been given by Poisson [17], Havas [18], and Spohn [19]. To summarize, though, a common\ntheme throughout all of these works has been that the equations of motion describing sufficiently small particles were\nfound to be independent of the details of their internal structure to a considerable degree of precision. Only a few\nparameters such as the rest mass and total charge entered into these equations. Ignoring the effects of spin and\ninternal currents, the apparently universal correction to the Lorentz force law is given by the well-known LorentzDirac self-force. If a particle with charge q has a center-of-mass position z a (s\u0304) (with s\u0304 being a proper time), then this\nself-force is equal to (using a metric with signature \u22122, and units in which c = 1)\n\u0011\n2 2 \u0010...a\nq z (s\u0304) + \u017c a (s\u0304)z\u0308 b (s\u0304)z\u0308b (s\u0304) .\n(1.1)\n3\nAlthough this is only an approximation to the full self-force for any realistic (extended) charge, it is natural to\nintroduce a new concept into the theory for which it is exact \u2013 that of a point particle. The immediate problem with\nthis is of course that the self-field diverges at the location of any point-like source, which would appear to imply that\nits self-force and self-energy are not well-defined. Dirac [12] removed this problem by noting that self-forces acting\nab\non a structureless particle should only arise as a reaction to emitted radiation. Letting Fself(+)\ndenote the advanced\nab\nab\nab\nab\nself-field and Fself(\u2212) the retarded one, we can define 'radiative' and 'singular' portions of Fself(\u2212) = Fself(S)\n+ Fself(R)\n:\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 ab\nab\n,\nFself(\u2212) + Fself(+)\n2\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 ab\nab\n.\nFself(\u2212) \u2212 Fself(+)\n=\n2\n\nab\n=\nFself(S)\n\n(1.2)\n\nab\nFself(R)\n\n(1.3)\n\nAs the names imply, the singular field contains the entire divergent part of the retarded field. It is also derived from\na time-symmetric Green function, so it would not be expected to contain any radiation. The self-force on a point\n\n\f2\nparticle should therefore be determined entirely by the radiative self-field. Combining it with the Lorentz force law\nimmediately recovers (1.1) [12].\nThis prescription is much simpler than any direct derivation of the equations of motion for a finite charge, and for\nthis reason, it has been generalized to work in curved spacetime, as well as for scalar and gravitational self-forces\n[17, 34] (although this is not the only way of 'renormalizing' point particle self-fields [26, 27]). As before, the relevance\nof these extensions to realistic extended bodies has also been established in certain special cases. In linearized gravity,\nfor example, a small nearly-Schwarzchild black hole has been found to obey the same equations of motion as a point\nparticle [17, 25]. More generally, it has been shown that a nonspinning body's internal structure is irrelevant to very\nhigh order within Post-Newtonian theory [13]. Still, there remain questions of exactly how universal these results are.\nWill a spherical neutron star in near-equilibrium fall into a supermassive black hole in the same way as another one\nthat is spinning rapidly and experiencing internal oscillations [38]; or one having a mountainous (solid) surface [37]?\nSuch systems could be important sources for the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).\nRather than addressing such questions directly, we have chosen to study the motions of charged bodies in flat\nspacetime (in part) as a model problem. The methods used here were specifically chosen so that very few conceptual\nchanges would be required to consider particles (charged or not) moving in a fully dynamic spacetime. This has\nled to some additional complexity not strictly necessary to solve the problem at hand, although the majority of the\ncomplicating issues have been placed in the the appendix.\nOur derivation is based on W. G. Dixon's multipole formalism [20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. This gives a relatively simple,\nunified, and rigorous way of understanding the motions of arbitrarily structured bodies in both electrodynamics and\ngeneral relativity. Despite the fact that Dixon's theory decomposes the source functions into multipole moments,\nwe never ignore any of them. By using generating functions, the entire infinite set is retained throughout all of our\ncalculations. This only appears to be possible in this formalism. The laws of motion that are used are therefore exact\n(despite being ordinary differential equations). All of the approximations that we make are only used to compute the\nself-field.\nTaking a hybrid point of view where an extended body can only interact with its radiative self-field, it is found that\nthe Lorentz-Dirac equation follows for a wide range of nonspinning charges with small dipole moments. If the body\ninstead interacts with its full retarded self-field, this result no longer holds. In this case, the equations of motion are\ndrastically different if the charge and (3-) current densities have remotely similar magnitudes in the center-of-mass\nframe. Although it is impractical to define exactly what this means at this point, it will be shown that one of these\nquantities must be at least 'second order' compared to the other in order for these extra terms to vanish. This is\nbecause these cases usually allow the self-fields to do significant amounts of internal work (e.g. Ohmic heating). Even\nwhen the charge-current coupling in negligible, there are still extra complications in the retarded case. The conditions\nrequired to generically exclude these and other complicating effects are derived, and turn out to be surprisingly\nrestrictive.\nSec. II reviews the various steps involved in calculating the motion of matter interacting with an electromagnetic\nfield. Sec. III then summarizes the appropriate definitions of the center-of-mass and its laws of motion as obtained\nfrom Dixon's formalism. It also decomposes the 4-current in a particular way that happens to be convenient in this\nframework. Although this reduction is not strictly required for the current problem, it is adopted throughout on the\ngrounds that it would be essential in curved spacetime. It is derived in detail in the appendix, which also contains an\nin-depth review of of Dixon's ideas.\nWith these basic ideas in place, Sec. IV goes on to derive expansions for the advanced and retarded self-fields of\nan arbitrarily-structured charge using a slow motion approximation. Sec. V then combines these results with those\nfrom Sec. III to find general expressions for the self-force and self-torque. Finally, Sec. VI examines the equations of\nmotion for certain simpler classes of charges, and derives some conditions under which the Lorentz-Dirac equation is\napplicable.\nWe use units in which c = 1 throughout. In order to facilitate a more direct comparison to Dixon's papers, the\nmetric is chosen to have signature \u22122 (although the rest of the notation used here frequently differs from Dixon's).\nWe also assume that the spacetime is flat, and adopt Minkowski coordinates for simplicity. Latin indices refer to these\ncoordinates, while Greek ones are triad labels running from 1 to 3.\nII.\n\nTHE PROBLEM OF MOTION\n\nIn studying the dynamics of any system in a classical field theory, one has to specify 'laws of motion' for both the\nfield and matter variables. In our case, the only field is of course the electromagnetic one, F ab = F [ab] . As usual, this\n\n\f3\nis governed by Maxwell's equations\n\u2202b F ab = J a ,\n[a\n\n\u2202 F\n\nbc]\n\n=0.\n\n(2.1)\n(2.2)\n\nWe assume that the matter in our problem is completely described by its stress-energy tensor T ab and 4-current\nvector J a . Taking the divergence of (2.1) immediately gives our first constraint on these quantities:\n\u2202a J a = 0 .\n\n(2.3)\n\nThis equation \u0001acts as one of the laws of motion for the matter fields. The other is derived from the requirement that\nab\nab\n\u2202a T ab + Tem\n= 0, where Tem\nis the stress-energy tensor of the electromagnetic field. Combining the standard form\nab\nof Tem [8] with Maxwell's equations then shows that the matter moves according to\n\u2202b T ab = \u2212F ab Jb .\n\n(2.4)\n\n(2.1)-(2.4) are essentially the entire content of classical continuum mechanics in flat spacetime. Of course, different\ntypes of matter do not all move in the same way, so these equations by themselves are not sufficient to determine T ab\nand J a for all time (even if the F ab were given). One also needs to specify something analogous to a (generalized)\nequation of state, which can take on a rather unwieldy form.\nThis sort of procedure is the standard one in continuum mechanics. Unfortunately, the resulting nonlinear partial\ndifferential equations are notoriously difficult to solve. Such a detailed description of the system should not really be\nrequired, however, for problems where we are only interested in the body's bulk motion. In these cases, a representative\nworld line could be defined inside the (convex hull of the) spacelike-compact support of T ab . Given that this worldline\ncan always be parametrized by a single quantity, its tangent vector might be expected to satisfy an ordinary differential\nequation \u2013 at least when using certain approximations. Solving such an equation would clearly be much more\nstraightforward than the partial differential equations that we started with.\nThis sort of simplification is one of the main motivations behind the many (source) multipole formalisms in the\nliterature [8, 30]. In these, one first fixes some particular reference frame which has, among other properties, a\npreferred time parameter s. The quantity being expanded \u2013 say J a (x) \u2013 can then be written in terms of an infinite\nset of tensors depending only on s: Qa (s), Qab (s), . . . The reverse is also true. Given J a , there is a well-defined way\nto compute any moment. The set {Q...} is therefore completely equivalent to J a . This implies that the conservation\nequation (2.3) may be used to find restrictions on the individual moments.\nSuch restrictions depend on the precise definitions that are being adopted, but can usually be divided into two\ngeneral classes. The first of these consists of purely algebraic equations imposed at a fixed value of s. We call these\nthe constraints. There are also a number of evolution equations which usually take the form of ordinary differential\nequations. Multipole expansions can therefore be used to convert (2.3) and (2.4) into a number of algebraic and\nordinary differential equations (without any approximation).\nThis does not actually simplify things as much as it at first might appear. The reason is that almost all definitions\nfor the source multipoles will lead to an infinite number of (coupled!) evolution equations. This is often dealt with\nin practice by assuming that all moments above a particular order are irrelevant, which leaves one with only a finite\nnumber of evolution equations. There are, however, interesting questions that require knowing the higher moments.\nJ a (or T ab ) for example, cannot be reconstructed without them. This means that the self-field cannot be calculated in\nthe near zone from only the first few moments. Although the self-force and self-torque can be found in certain cases by\nexamining energy and momentum fluxes in the far zone [12, 15, 17, 25] (which can be adequately approximated using\nonly a finite number of moments), this is considerably less accurate than integrating the force density throughout the\ncharge's interior.\nFor these reasons and others, it is desirable to define a set of multipoles that do not require any cutoff. Remarkably,\nsuch a set exists [20], and is essentially unique [23]. Without any approximation, moments for both J a and T ab can be\ndefined which satisfy a finite number of evolution equations. There remain (uncoupled) constraint equations for each\nmoment, although these are easily solved. We adopt this formalism due to Dixon for the remainder of this paper. Its\nnet effect is to allow us to relate the motion to the fields in a more rigorous way than is usually done (short of directly\nsolving (2.3) and (2.4)). It does not, however, have anything to say about the fields themselves. We therefore obtain\nthe self-field in a standard way, and then use Dixon's equations to find how the matter moves in response to it.\nIII.\n\nLAWS OF MOTION\n\nAs noted, we use Dixon's method [20, 21, 22, 23, 24] to decompose J a and T ab into multipole moments. Each of\nthese sets is designed to describe as simply as possible all possible forms of J a and T ab satisfying their respective\n\n\f4\nconservation equations. We first assume that these matter fields are at least piecewise continuous, and have (identical)\nsupports W . Any intersection of a spacelike hypersurface with this worldtube is assumed to be compact.\nNow choose a timelike worldline Z \u2282 W , and a timelike unit vector field na (s) defined on Z. It is assumed that\nthis is always possible in any physically interesting system. Z is then parameterized by the coordinate function z a (s),\nand the tangent vector to it is denoted by v a (s) := dz a /ds =: \u017c a (s). v a need not be equal to na , although it will be\nconvenient to normalize s such that na va = 1 (so v a va 6= 1 in general). v a is called the kinematical velocity, while na\nis the dynamical velocity. The set {Z, na } then defines a reference frame for the definition of the multipole moments.\nAt this point, it should be thought of as arbitrary, although physical conditions will later be given that pick out a\nunique 'center-of-mass' frame.\nA collection of spacelike hyperplanes {\u03a3} can easily be constructed from Z and na . Each \u03a3(s) is to pass through\na\nz (s), and be (everywhere) orthogonal to na (s). Assume that any point in W is contained in exactly one of these\nplanes. Unless na is a constant, it is clear that this property cannot\nbe true throughout the entire spacetime. For\n\u0001\nx \u2208 \u03a3(s) \u2229 W , we must therefore have that max |\u1e45a (s) x \u2212 z(s) a | < 1 (among other conditions), which gives a weak\nrestriction on the body's maximum size. It is not really important, though, as any reasonable type of matter would\nbe ripped apart long before this condition was violated.\nThe main results that we need from Dixon's theory at this point are his definitions of the linear and angular\nmomenta. These disagree with the usual ones when either J a or F ab are nonzero, although it is still convenient to\nlabel them by pa (s) and S ab (s) respectively. Unless otherwise noted, the words 'linear and angular momenta' will\nalways refer to the quantities [20, 21]\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ 1\nZ\n\u0001\nab\nb\nac\na\n,\n(3.1)\ndu F z(s) + ur\nd\u03a3b T + J rc\np (s) =\n\u03a3(s)\n\nS ab (s) = 2\n\nZ\n\n\u03a3(s)\n\n0\n\n\u0014\nZ\nd\u03a3c r[a T b]c + J c rd\n\n1\n\ndu ur[a F b]d z(s) + ur\n\n0\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0015\n\n,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere ra := xa \u2212 z a (s), and u is just a dummy parameter used to integrate along the line segment connecting z a (s)\nto xa = z a (s) + ra .\nDetailed motivations for these definitions can be found in [20, 21, 23], as well as the appendix. In short, though, it\ncan be shown that the given quantities are uniquely determined by demanding that stress-energy conservation directly\naffect only the first two moments of T ab (once the concept of a moment has been defined in a reasonable way). If pa\nand S ab are known in some time interval and satisfy the appropriate evolution equations, the class of all stress-energy\ntensors with these moments can be constructed without having to solve any differential equations. Each of these will\nexactly satisfy (2.4).\nThis property implies that evolution equations for the quadrupole and higher moments of the stress-energy tensor\nare nearly unconstrained. They can be thought of as the 'equation of state' of the material under consideration. This\ntype of independence of the higher moments from the conservation laws also occurs in Newtonian theory [24], and\nthere are considerable advantages in preserving as much of that structure as possible in the relativistic regime. In\nparticular, there is no need to discard multipole moments above a certain order. The choices (3.1) and (3.2) allow us\nto retain many of the conveniences of a multipole formalism without its classic limitations.\nThe same definitions for the momenta can also be motivated by considering charged particles in curved spacetime\n[21, 24]. There, one can study the conserved quantities associated with Killing vectors in appropriate spacetimes\n(where both the metric and electromagnetic field are assumed to share the same symmetries). Fixing Z and na (s)\nallows each such quantity to be written as a linear combination of vector and antisymmetric rank 2 tensor fields on\nZ. Crucially, the definitions of these quantities do not depend on the Killing vector under consideration, so we can\nsuppose that they are meaningful even in the absence of any symmetries. If the metric is taken to be flat, these\nobjects reduce to (3.1) and (3.2) [21]. They are therefore the natural limits of what would generally be referred to as\nthe linear and angular momenta of symmetric spacetimes.\nIt is now convenient to define a coordinate system on W that is more closely adapted to the system than the\nMinkowski coordinates used so far. First choose an orthonormal tetrad {na (s), ea\u03b1 (s)} (\u03b1 = 1, 2, 3) along Z. Requiring\nthat each of these vectors remain orthonormal to the others implies that\n\u0117a\u03b1 = \u2212na \u1e45b eb\u03b1 ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhich is essentially Fermi-Walker transport. A spatial (rotation) term may also be added to this, although our calculations would then become considerably more tedious. On its own, the choice of tetrad has no physical significance,\nso we choose the simplest case.\nSince it was assumed that {\u03a3} foliates W , any point x \u2208 \u03a3(s) \u2229 W may now be uniquely written in terms of s and\na 'triad radius' r\u03b1\nxa = ea\u03b1 (s)r\u03b1 + z a (s) .\n\n(3.4)\n\n\f5\nVarying r\u03b1 with a fixed value of s clearly generates \u03a3(s). Also, the Jacobian of the coordinate transformation\n(xa ) \u2192 (r\u03b1 , s) is equal to the lapse N of the foliation,\nN (x) = 1 \u2212 \u1e45a (s)ra ,\n= 1 \u2212 \u1e45a (s)ea\u03b1 (s)r\u03b1 .\n\n(3.5)\n\nWe will be extensively transforming back and forth between these two coordinate systems, so it is convenient to\nabuse the notation somewhat by writing f (r\u03b1 , s) = f (xa ) for any function f . The intended dependencies should\nalways be clear from the context. It is also useful to denote quantities such as \u1e45a ea\u03b1 by \u1e45\u03b1 . Note that in this notation,\nn\u0308\u03b1 = n\u0308a ea\u03b1 6= d\u1e45\u03b1 /ds.\nUsing these conventions, it is natural to split J a into the charge and 3-current densities seen by an observer at\nr = 0 (the 'center-of-mass observer')\nJ a = \u03c1na + ea\u03b1 j \u03b1 .\n\n(3.6)\n\nIt is then shown in the appendix that there exist 'potentials' \u03c6 and H \u03b1 which generate J a through the equations\n\u03c1 = \u2202\u03b1 (r\u03b1 \u03c6) ,\nh\ni\nj \u03b1 = N \u22121 H \u03b1 + v \u03b2 \u2202\u03b2 (r\u03b1 \u03c6) \u2212 r\u03b1 \u03c6\u0307 .\n\n(3.7)\n(3.8)\n\nDenoting the total charge by q and letting\n|r|2 := \u2212r\u03b1 r\u03b1 \u2265 0, \u03c6 (r\u03b1 , s) was found to be continuous, and equal to\n\u0001\nq/4\u03c0|r|3 outside W . Similarly, H \u03b1 r\u03b2 , s is given by (A40) outside W , and is piecewise continuous in r\u03b2 . H \u03b1 also\nsatisfies \u2202\u03b1 H \u03b1 = 0. These properties guarantee that J a has support W , and is everywhere continuous. A direct\ncalculation also shows that\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n(3.9)\n\u2212 v \u03b2 \u2202\u03b2 J b + \u2202\u03b2 j \u03b2 ,\n\u2202a J a = N \u22121 nb\n\u2202s\n= 0,\n(3.10)\nas required by (2.3).\nAny physically reasonable current vector can now be constructed by choosing potentials satisfying these rules. A\nphysical interpretation of one's choice is then given by substitution into (3.7) and (3.8). For example, a uniform\nspherical charge distribution with time-varying radius D(s) is described by (assuming na = v a )\n\"\n#\n\u0012\n\u00133\n\u0001\n\u0001\nq\nD(s)\n\u03c6(r, s) =\n\u0398 D(s) \u2212 |r| +\n,\n(3.11)\n\u0398 |r| \u2212 D(s)\n4\u03c0D3 (s)\n|r|\nH \u03b1 (r, s) = 0 ,\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhere \u0398(*) is the Heaviside step function. (3.7) and (3.8) then show that the tetrad components of J a are\n\u0001\n3q\n\u0398 D \u2212 |r| ,\n3\n4\u03c0D\n!\n\u0001\n3qr\u03b1\n\u1e0a(s)\n\u03b1\nj (r, s) =\n\u0398 D(s) \u2212 |r| .\n4\u03c0N (r, s)D3 (s) D(s)\n\u03c1(r, s) =\n\n(3.13)\n(3.14)\n\nIt is also clearly possible to calculate \u03c6 and H \u03b1 from any given J a . This requires inverting (3.7), which acts\nas a partial differential equation for \u03c6 on each time slice. The solution to this equation would usually have to be\nobtained numerically, which is clearly inconvenient. Largely for this reason, we shall consider \u03c6 and H \u03b1 to be the\ngiven quantities for the remainder of this paper. J a can be derived from them using operations no more complicated\nthan differentiation.\nAnother reason for this unconventional choice is that \u03c6 and H \u03b1 contain all of the multipole moments of J a in a\nnatural way. As shown in the appendix, they are closely related to the Fourier transform of a generating function\nfor these moments. An arbitrary current moment can be obtained essentially by differentiating the inverse Fourier\ntransforms of the potentials a suitable number of times. For example, (A1), (A24), (A30), (A31), and (A38) can be\nused to show that the dipole moment has the general form\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\nZ\nq\nab\n3\n[a b] \u03b2\na b\n\u03b1\u03b2\nQ = d r 2n e\u03b2 r N \u03c6(r, s) \u2212\n+ e\u03b1 e\u03b2 H\u0304 (r, s) ,\n(3.15)\n4\u03c0|r|3\n\n\f6\nwhere H\u0304 \u03b1\u03b2 = H\u0304 [\u03b1\u03b2] is defined by\nH \u03b1 = \u2202\u03b2 H\u0304 \u03b1\u03b2 .\n\n(3.16)\n\nqv [\u03b1 r\u03b2]\n2\u03c0|r|3\n\n(3.17)\n\nGiven (A40), we let\nH\u0304 \u03b1\u03b2 =\n\noutside W .\nFor the example given in (3.11) and (3.12), the dipole moment is equal to\nQab =\n\n1 2\nqD (s)n[a \u1e45b] .\n5\n\n(3.18)\n\nThis might have been expected to vanish in spherical symmetry, although it should be noted that it is only nonzero\nwhen sphericity is being defined in an accelerated reference frame.\nThese constructions can now be used to simplify the definitions of pa and S ab .

Denoting such moments by \u03a8a (s) and \u03a8ab (s) respectively, it is possible to prove (A56) and (A57). It is then\nnatural to refer to \u2212\u03a8a as the net force, and \u22122\u03a8[ab] as the net torque acting on the body. Viewing these quantities\nas force moments allows one to derive (A61) and (A62). But these results are no different than (3.26) and (3.27). If\ndesired, the reader may therefore view \u03a8a and \u03a8[ab] to be defined by (A56) and (A57).\nIn cases where F ab varies slowly in the center-of-mass frame (both spatially and temporally), the expressions for\nthe force and torque can be expanded in Taylor series involving successively higher multipole moments of the current\ndensity (denoted by Q*** ). Deriving such equations would be awkward using the methods introduced in this section,\nso we simply refer to (A63) and (A64). Despite the peculiar definitions of the current moments being used, these\nexpansions are exactly what one would expect out of a multipole formalism, and can therefore be considered a check\nthat Dixon's definitions are reasonable.\nIn most cases where (A63) and (A64) are any simpler than the exact expressions for the force and torque, only\nthe monopole and dipole moments will be significant. These moments can be computed from (A13) and (3.15)\nrespectively. In the limit that the particle is vastly smaller than any of the field's length scales, only the monopole\nmoment will enter the equations of motion. In this case, the force reduces to the standard Lorentz expression and the\ntorque vanishes, as expected.\nThe final ingredients required to complete this formalism are unique prescriptions for Z and na . Simply knowing\nthe linear and angular momenta at any point in time does not necessarily determine the body's location in any useful\nway. The problem is compounded by the fact that these quantities are strongly dependent on the choice of reference\nframe itself. Indeed, without knowing where W is, it is essentially impossible to specify J a in any meaningful way.\nThese problems can be removed by choosing Z and na appropriately, and then assuming that the resulting worldline\nprovides a reasonable representation of the body's 'average' position. Following [21, 23, 24, 28], we first assume that\nfor any point z \u2208 W , there exists a unique future-directed timelike unit vector na (z) such that\npa (z; n) = M (z; n)na (z) ,\n\n(3.28)\n\nfor some positive scalar M . Here, we have temporarily changed the dependencies of pa and na for clarity. It is seen\nfrom (3.1) that pa depends nontrivially on both the base point z, and on na , which defines the surface of integration.\n(3.28) is therefore a highly implicit definition of na .\nIn any case, another condition must be also be given to fix z. We want this to lie on a 'center-of-mass line' in some\nsense, so it would be reasonable to expect the 'mass dipole moment' defined with respect to it to vanish:\nnb nc tabc = 0 ,\n\n(3.29)\n\nwhere tabc is the full dipole moment of the stress-energy tensor. This is defined by (A47), so (3.29) is equivalent to\nna (z) S ab (z; n) = 0 .\n\n(3.30)\n\nThe integral form of (3.30) reduces to the standard center-of-mass condition when F ab = 0 and na = v a . It also\nallows us to write the angular momentum in terms of a single 3-vector S a\nS ab = \u01ebabcd nc Sd .\n\n(3.31)\n\nOf course, both of these properties would also have been satisfied by instead requiring va S ab = 0. We reject this\nchoice due to the fact that it leads to nonzero accelerations even when F ab = 0 [32]. Replacing v a by na avoids\nthis peculiar behavior, which we consider to be an important requirement for anything deserving to be called a\ncenter-of-mass line. It also seems more natural to define the mass dipole moment in terms of na rather than v a .\nFor the remainder of this paper, we assume that (3.28) and (3.30) are always satisfied, and call the resulting Z and\nna (s) the center of mass frame [21, 24, 28]. It is not obvious that solutions to these highly implicit equations exist,\nalthough existence and uniqueness have been proven in the gravitational case [29]. There, it is also true that (given\ncertain reasonable conditions) Z is necessarily a timelike worldline inside the convex hull of W . We assume that the\nsame results extend to electrodynamics.\nThe uniqueness of these definitions is actually not very critical for our purposes. The important point is that\na solution with the given properties can presumably be chosen for a sufficiently large class of systems. While it is\nclearly very difficult to find the center-of-mass directly from T ab , J a , and F ab , it is relatively straightforward to simply\nconstruct sets of moments which automatically incorporate (3.28) and (3.30). (3.7) and (3.8) show, for example, that\nthese definitions do not have any effect on our ability to construct arbitrary current vectors adapted to them. There\n\n\f8\nis nothing preventing the moment potentials \u03c6 and H \u03b1 from being appropriately centered around r\u03b1 = 0. Although\nit is not obvious that this can also be done for the stress-energy tensor, we conjecture that it can.\nNow that (3.28) and (3.30) have been assumed to hold, we need evolution equations for M , na , and z a . These are\neasily found from (A56) and (A57):\n\u1e40 = \u2212na \u03a8a ,\nM \u1e45a = \u2212hab \u03a8b ,\n\nM (v a \u2212 na ) = S ab \u1e45b \u2212 2\u03a8[ab] nb ,\n\n(3.32)\n(3.33)\n(3.34)\n\nwhere hab is the projection operator \u03b4ba \u2212 na nb . Note that the last of these equations shows that na = v a if the spin\nand torque both vanish.\nIn general, (A57) and (3.32)-(3.34) may be used together to find the motion of the body's center-of-mass in terms\nof \u03a8a and \u03a8[ab] . Once the field is known, these quantities follow from (A61) and (A62). Some recipe for evolving the\ndipole and higher current moments in time \u2013 most conveniently expressed in terms of \u03c6\u0307 and \u1e22 \u03b1 \u2013 is also required.\nCombining all of these elements together leaves us with a well-defined initial value problem that will determine z a ,\nna , M , S ab , and J a . If the stress-energy tensor is also desired, possible forms of it could in principle be constructed\nfrom (A51) and (A54) in the same way that J a was derived from \u03c6 and H \u03b1 . Combining all of these steps would\ncompletely characterize the system, although we shall omit the last one. The result is still sufficient to answer most\nquestions that one would be interested in asking of a nearly isolated particle.\nIV.\n\nTHE FIELD\n\nIt is clear from the previous section that the equations of motion will easily follow once \u03a8a and \u03a8[ab] are known.\nThese depend on the field, which we now calculate. For a reasonably isolated body, it is first convenient to split F ab\ninto two parts\nab\nab\nF ab = Fext\n+ Fself\n.\n\n(4.1)\n\nThe external field is assumed to be generated by outside sources, while the self-field is entirely due to the charge itself.\nSince (A61) and (A62) are linear in F ab , the force and torque can also be split up into 'self' and 'external' portions.\nIn Lorenz gauge, the vector potential sourced by the particle is given by [8]\nZ\n\u0001\na\nAself (x) = \u2212 d4 x\u2032 J a (x\u2032 )\u03b4 \u03c3(x, x\u2032 ) ,\n(4.2)\nwhere\n\n\u03c3(x, x\u2032 ) =\n\n1\n(x \u2212 x\u2032 )a (x \u2212 x\u2032 )a ,\n2\n\n(4.3)\n\nis Synge's world function [17, 31]. In realistic systems, this potential will couple to the external one via the outside\nmatter fields. These may act as reflectors or dielectrics, or there may be an n-body interaction where the self-fields\ninfluence the motion of some external charged particles (obviously affecting the fields in W ). Although it would be\nreasonable to group together all portions of F ab causally related to our particle in some way as the 'self-field,' this\nab\nwould be impossible to do with any generality. Instead, we simply define the Fself\nto be the field derived from (4.2)\nin the usual way (this differs from the point of view taken in e.g. [35]). The interactions of the self-field with the\noutside world will all be categorized as 'external' effects that we presume can be accounted for by separate methods.\nab\nIf all of the external matter is sufficiently far away from W (and slowly varying), Fext\nwill be approximately constant\n[ab]\na\nwithin each \u03a3(s) \u2229 W slice (and from one slice to the 'next'). \u03a8ext and \u03a8ext can therefore be approximated by (A63)\nab\nand (A64) in these cases. Finding the self-force and self-torque is more complicated. For this, Fself\nhas to be combined\nwith the exact integral expressions for the force and torque \u2013 (A61) and (A62). The detailed structure of the self-field\nmust therefore be known throughout W .\nThis easily follows from Aaself :\nb]\n\nab\nFself\n(x) = 2\u2202 [a Aself ,\nZ\n= \u22122 d4 x\u2032 \u03b4 \u2032 (\u03c3)(x \u2212 x\u2032 )[a J b] .\n\n(4.4)\n\n\f9\nab\nWriting x in terms of (r\u03b1 , s), and x\u2032 in terms of (r\u2032\u03b1 , \u03c4 ), and defining \u03c3\u0307(x, x\u2032 ) := \u2202\u03c3/\u2202\u03c4 , Fself\nbecomes\n(\n\u0014\n\u0015)\nZ\n1 d N\n\u2032 [a b]\n3 \u2032\nab\n(x \u2212 x ) J\n.\nFself(\u00b1) (x) = 2 d r\n|\u03c3\u0307| d\u03c4 \u03c3\u0307\n\n(4.5)\n\n\u03c4 =\u03c4\u00b1\n\n\u03c4+ (> s) represents the advanced time, and \u03c4\u2212 the retarded one. These are found by solving \u03c3(x, x\u2032 ) = 0 with x and\nr\u2032 held fixed.\nAlthough we only consider the retarded field to be real, the advanced solution is also retained for now. This allows\nus to later construct the radiative self-field, which is considerably simpler than the full retarded field. It would be\nquite convenient if the self-forces generated by the two fields were identical (as Dirac assumed for point particles [12]),\nalthough we will show that this is not true in general.\nab\nReturning to the explicit form for Fself\n, splitting up J a according to (3.6) shows that\n( \u0014\n\u0012\n\u0015\n\u0013\nZ\n\u03c3\u0308\nab\n3 \u2032 N\nFself (x) = 2 d r\n\u03c1 (x \u2212 x\u2032 )[a \u1e45b] \u2212\n+ N \u22121 n\u0308\u03b1 r\u03b1\u2032 (x \u2212 x\u2032 )[a nb] \u2212 v [a nb] + \u03c1\u0307(x \u2212 x\u2032 )[a nb]\n\u03c3\u0307|\u03c3\u0307|\n\u03c3\u0307\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0011 \u0015\n\u0010\n\u03c3\u0308\n\u2032 [a b]\n\u03b1\n\u2032 [a b]\n[a\n[a\n\u22121 \u03b2 \u2032\n\u2212 j (x \u2212 x ) e\u03b1\n+ N n\u0308 r\u03b2 + \u1e45\u03b1 (x \u2212 x ) n + N n + (h * v) eb]\n\u03b1\n\u03c3\u0307\n)\n+ j\u0307 \u03b1 (x \u2212 x\u2032 )[a eb]\n\u03b1\n\n.\n\n(4.6)\n\na\nHere, j\u0307 \u03b1 (r\u2032 , \u03c4 ) := \u2202j \u03b1 (r\u2032 , \u03c4 )/\u2202\u03c4 , which differs from our usual convention (e.g. \u1e45\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) := e\u03b1\na (\u03c4 )dn (\u03c4 )/d\u03c4 ).\nMoving on, (4.3) implies that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c3\u0307(x, x\u2032 ) = \u2212 N (r\u2032 , \u03c4 )na (\u03c4 ) + (h * v)a (\u03c4 ) (x \u2212 x\u2032 )a ,\n\n(4.7)\n\nand\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd(h * v)a\na\na \u03b2 \u2032\n\u03c3\u0308(x, x ) = N + v v\u03b1 \u2212 N \u1e45 \u2212 n n\u0308 r\u03b2 +\n(x \u2212 x\u2032 )a .\nd\u03c4\n\u2032\n\n2\n\n\u03b1\n\n(4.8)\n\nIf we now specify how \u03c6 and H \u03b1 vary in time (which determines \u03c1\u0307 and j\u0307 \u03b1 ), we would have all of the ingredients\nnecessary to find the body's motion without any approximation. Unfortunately, inserting (4.6) into (A57), (A61),\n(A62), and (3.32)-(3.34) leads to a set of delay integro-differential equations for the object's motion. Such a system\nwould be extremely difficult to solve (or even interpret) in general, although it could be a useful starting point for\nnumerical simulations. It might also be interesting analytically if one were looking for the forces required to make a\nbody move in some pre-determined way (e.g. a circular orbit).\nSuch questions will not be discussed here. We instead consider the simplest possible approximations that allow us\nto gain insight into a generic class of systems. In particular, it is assumed that all of the quantities in (4.6) which\ndepend on \u03c4\u00b1 may be written in terms of quantities at s (via Taylor expansion). This requires that nothing very\ndrastic happen on timescales less than the body's light-crossing time. This is not as trivial a condition as it might\nseem to be (see e.g. [33]), although we will not attempt to justify it.\nExpressing everything in terms of s rather than \u03c4\u00b1 first requires calculating \u2206\u00b1 := s \u2212 \u03c4\u00b1 . \u03c4\u00b1 was defined by \u03c3 = 0,\nso \u2206\u00b1 can be found by Taylor expanding this equation in \u2206\u00b1 .

Since |\u2206\u00b1 | \u223c |r \u2212 r\u2032 |, these terms\u0001 can be reasonably neglected if | n |R3 \u226a |n\u0308|R2 \u226a\n|\u1e45|R \u226a 1, and |v\u0307 \u2212 \u1e45|R \u226a |h * v| \u226a |\u1e45|R, where R := max |r|, |r\u2032 | . In a sense, we are expanding up to second order\nin powers of |\u1e45|R, and up to first order in |v|.\nThe requirement |\u1e45|R \u226a 1 must hold for all (r, r\u2032 ) pairs, so it is useful to define the largest possible value of R.\nWe call this the body's 'radius'\nD(s) := max |r| .\n\n(4.12)\n\n\u03a3(s)\u2229W\n\nUsing it, |\u1e45|R \u226a 1 implies |\u1e45|D \u226a 1. This technically restricts the allowable size of the charge, although very few\nreasonable systems would actually be excluded.\nInterpreting the relation satisfied by (h * v)a (= v a \u2212 na ) isn't quite as simple. Given (3.34), it is roughly equivalent\nto assuming that spin effects are present only to lowest nontrivial order. This is not completely accurate, though, and\nmore precise statements will be given in the following section.\nIn any case, the inequalities following (4.11) will be assumed to hold from now on.

We shall simply assume that J a is sufficiently\nhomogeneous\nthat dimensional analysis can be used to say, for example, that the absolute value of the error in\nR 3 \u2032\nab\nd r \u03c1(r\u2032 , \u03c4\u00b1 )f(1)\n/R3 is less than about\n\u01eb3 max |\u03c1|D .\n\n(4.22)\n\n|\u03a8\u03b1 | < M T \u22121 .\n\n(4.23)\n\nWith this established, we can also use the assumptions outlined in the previous section to provide bounds on the\nforce and torque. Combining |\u1e45| < T \u22121 with (3.33),\n\nSince T \u226b D, this means that the particle cannot be accelerated up to an appreciable fraction of the speed of light\nwithin a light-crossing time \u2013 a very reasonable restriction.\nDifferentiating (3.33),\nGenerically, this implies that |n\u0308| < T\n\n\u22122\n\nM n\u0308\u03b1 = \u2212\u03a8\u0307\u03b1 \u2212 2\u1e40 \u1e45\u03b1 .\n\n(4.24)\n\ncan be ensured by assuming\n< M T \u22121 ,\n\n(4.25)\n\n\u03a8\u0307\u03b1 < M T \u22122 .\n\n(4.26)\n\n\u1e40\n\n\f12\nDifferentiating (3.33) a second time and using (3.32), we also have that\n< M T \u22122 ,\n\n(4.27)\n\n\u03a8\u0308\u03b1 < M T \u22123 ,\n\n(4.28)\n\nna \u03a8\u0307a < M T \u22122 .\n\n(4.29)\n\nM\u0308\n\nif\n\nSimilar restrictions on the spin and torque can be found by using (3.34). In particular, |v| will remain less than \u01eb2\nS \u03b1\u03b2 := |S \u03b1 | < \u01ebM D ,\n\n(4.30)\n\n2\n\u03a8[ab] e\u03b1\na nb < \u01eb M .\n\n(4.31)\n\nDifferentiating (3.34), |\u1e45 \u2212 v\u0307|D \u226a \u01eb2 is implied by\n\u03a8[\u03b1\u03b2] \u226a \u01ebM ,\n\n(4.32)\n\n\u03a8\u0307[ab] e\u03b1\na nb \u226a \u01ebM D .\n\n(4.33)\n\nAlthough weaker restrictions than these can be adopted in special cases, we assume for simplicity that they always\nhold. More concisely, we are restricting ourselves to systems where the magnitude of each tetrad component of the\n(full self + external) force is bounded by about M T \u22121 , and the magnitude of each torque component is no larger than\n\u01eb2 M . Bounds on the s-derivatives of these quantities are suppressed by appropriate factors of T . These conditions\nbasically mean that the body can only change significantly over timescales larger than T . (4.30), for example, implies\nthat this timescale sets a lower bound on the charge's rotational period.\nThese interpretations should not be surprising. Unfortunately, though, they are quite not as simple as they appear.\nCombining them with (A61) and (A62) can lead to less obvious bounds on the structure of J a itself. One of these\naffects the size of the particle's dipole moment. If the self-torque is small compared to the external one, then the\nmagnitudes of\n\u03b2]\u03b3\n\n\u03b2]\n\n\u03b2\u03b3\nac\nac bd\nQ[\u03b1 \u03b3 Fext , na ec\u03b3 Qa c Fext\n, na e\u03b3c Q\u03b2 \u03b3 Fext\n, e[\u03b1\na eb nc nd Q Fext\n\n(4.34)\n\nshould all be less than about \u01eb2 M . If q is negligible, these conditions ensure that both the force and torque are\nsufficiently small.\nIn most cases of interest, though, q 6= 0. Bounding the quantities in (4.34) then guarantees only that the torque\nis acceptable. The (full) force will often be dominated by the monopole component of \u03a8aext , in which case (applying\n(4.23) and (4.25))\nab\nM T \u22121 > qe\u03b1\na nb Fext ,\n\n>\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\nqv\u03b2 Fext\n\n.\n\n(4.35)\n(4.36)\n\nSince v\u03b2 is small, this second bound allows the magnetic field to be quite large. Despite this, we choose to assume\n\u0001\u22121\n(purely for simplicity) that both the electric and magnetic fields are bounded by M |q|T\n. If the fields are in fact\nas large as these equations allow, then the previous bounds on the dipole moment imply that\nQ\u03b1\u03b2 . \u01eb|q|D ,\n\n(4.37)\n\nalong with a similar restriction on Qab e\u03b1\na nb . This implies that the 'center-of-charge' must be very close to the\ncenter-of-mass, which considerably reduces the number of current distributions that we can allow. Note, however,\nthat these assumptions could be relaxed somewhat if extra conditions are placed on the sizes of the field components.\nTo find some other implications of our approximations, we now study a particular example in detail before moving\non to computing general self-forces.\n\n\f13\nV.\n\nSELF-FORCES\n\nA.\n\nStationary Case\n\nIt was shown in the previous section that (4.17)-(4.21) approximate the self-field due to a charge with an (almost)\narbitrarily accelerating center-of-mass line. These equations become exact when \u1e45a = 0 and na = v a .

Anything emitting a focused beam of radiation, for example, will experience some recoil. It will also lose a\nbit of mass over time, and can even start rotating if the the beam is offset from the source's center-of-mass. These\ncan all be thought of as self-force and self-torque effects, and clearly do not require v\u0307 a 6= 0.\nSince (5.1) is exact, one could compute self-forces and self-torques for a variety of systems without any approximation. If these were nonzero, the assumptions leading to (5.1) would not be maintained unless there were also external\nforces and torques present that exactly balanced them. Such a situation would be rather artificial, so we instead\napply the approximations of Sec. IV, and use the resulting self-force and self-torque to gain some intuition into more\ngeneral cases.\nAssuming that |\u03c6| \u226b |\u03c6\u0307|D \u226b |\u03c6\u0308|D2 , except perhaps at isolated points, one can show that\n(\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n1\n1 \u2032\u03b2\n3\n3 \u2032\n\u03b1\n2\n\u03b1 \u2032\n\u03b1\n\u2032\n\u03b2 \u2032\nd r d r 3 R \u03c1(r, s)\u1e22 (r , s) \u2212 2(r \u2212 r) H\u03b2 (r, s)\n\u03a8self(\u00b1) \u2243\nr \u03c6\u0307(r , s) \u2213 R\u1e22 (r , s)\nR\n2\n)\n\u0015\n\u0013\u0014\n\u0012\nq\n\u03b2 \u2032\n\u2032 \u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u2032 \u03b3\n(5.2)\n(r \u2212 r ) r\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b2 (r \u2212 r ) r\u03b3 \u1e22 (r , s) ,\n+ \u03c6(r, s) \u2212\n4\u03c0|r|3\n\nto first order in \u03c6\u0307 and \u1e22 \u03b1 . This illustrates that \u03a8\u03b1 is bounded by \u03c6\u0307HD5 (meaning max |\u03c6\u0307| max |H|D5 ), \u03c6\u1e22D5 , or\nH \u1e22D5 (whichever is largest). If H \u03b1 is very small compared to \u03c6, then the lowest order contributions to the self-force\ncan be shown to be of order \u03c6\u03c6\u0308D6 .\nIt is then clear that unless the system is particularly symmetric, self-forces with these magnitudes are unavoidable.\nThey would considerably complicate the equations of motion when considering nonzero center-of-mass accelerations,\nso it would be convenient to ignore them. This is self-consistent with the approximations already in place if the\ncharge's 'elasticity' is bounded by\n\u03c6\u0307D < \u01eb2 \u03c6 ,\n\u03c6\u0308D2 \u226a \u01eb2 \u03c6 ,\n\n\u1e22D \u226a \u01eb2 H .\n\n(5.3)\n(5.4)\n(5.5)\n\nIf these relations hold, the self-force becomes negligible whenever \u1e45a = 0 and na = v a ; i.e. a charge at rest will\nremain at rest unless acted on by an external field. For this reason, all of the calculations that follow will assume\n(5.3) and (5.4) to be true. (5.5) is extremely simple to relax, so it will be eventually be replaced with \u1e22D < \u01eb2 H.\nThe interested reader could easily weaken these conditions even further, although we regard the extra complication\nto be unnecessary for the present purposes.\nIn writing down (5.1), both \u1e45a = 0 and na = v a were required. This second condition was adopted here for\nsimplicity, although it is by no means 'natural.' Given (3.34), it can only hold if \u03a8[ab] nb = 0. But combining (5.3)(5.5) with (A62) and (5.1) shows that this portion of the torque is usually nonzero even if \u03c6\u0307 = \u1e22 \u03b1 = 0. Generically,\none finds that \u03a8[ab] nb will only be small if either \u03c6 \u226a H or H \u226a \u03c6. na \u2243 v a is not a particularly important\nrequirement, so we choose not to impose these restrictions on the current structure. In general, then, na 6= v a even\nwhen \u1e45a = 0 (and \u03c6 can be of order H).\nOf course, |n \u2212 v| = |v| still can't exceed \u01eb2 . As was already shown, this remains true if each tetrad component\nof \u03a8[ab] is bounded by \u01eb2 M (and |S| < \u01ebM D). We now strengthen this assumption slightly, and require the self and\nexternal components of the torque to be individually less than \u01eb2 M . There are then terms in the self-torque which\nviolate this unless more restrictions are placed on the particle's current structure.\n\n\f14\n[ab]\n\nUsing (5.1) and (A62) again, one can see that the tetrad components of \u03a8self will be of order \u03c6HD5 , \u03c6\u03c6\u0307D6 ,\netc. These\n\u0001 types of quantities can be conveniently simplified by defining an 'electromagnetic radius' Dem \u223c\n\u03c62 + H 2 D6 /M . D. Dem /D then estimates the fraction of the particle's mass that is of (macroscopic) electromagnetic origin. This ratio will come up often, so let\n\u0013\n\u0012\nDem\n.1.\n(5.6)\nE :=\nD\nIn this notation, \u03c6\u03c6\u0307D6 \u2192 \u01eb2 EM , and \u03c6HD5 \u2192 EM . If \u03c6 and H are comparable, the second of these expressions\nis clearly the one that estimates the self-torque. Enforcing (4.31) in this case therefore requires\nE < \u01eb2 .\n\n(5.7)\n\nConditions weaker than this can be adopted if the particle is dominated by either \u03c6 or H \u03b1 , although it will still be\ntrue that E \u226a 1 (except in special cases). Surprisingly, our approximations place a severe restriction on the charge's\nself-energy. This makes it impossible to ever take the point particle limit in a strict sense (if such a thing is even\nmeaningful). Such a procedure is not, however, necessary to answer whether a particle's size is important when it is\nmuch smaller than the characteristic scales of the surrounding system (the 'physical point particle limit').\nIt is interesting to note that this condition is really independent of any of Dixon's special constructions. In almost\nany slow motion approximation, one would expect that |\u1e60| . |S|T \u22121 and |S| . M D2 T \u22121 . So \u03a8[ab] \u223c |\u1e60| . \u01eb2 M is\ngeneric. And this is exactly the condition that led to (5.7). The specific form of the torque needed to show this did use\nDixon's definition, but the more common one wouldn't have changed anything. This can be verified by substituting\n(5.1) into the first term in (A62).\nAlso note that when E \u223c 1, it is not clear that any slow motion assumption is even physically reasonable. It\nseems difficult, for example, to avoid the extremely high frequency self-sustaining oscillations discussed by Bohm and\nWeinstein [33], among others. When E is small, it is easy to imagine that oscillations like these would have extremely\nsmall amplitudes, or at least be highly damped in causal systems. But the degree of rigidity required to hold together\na charge with very large self-energy might prevent this.\nB.\n\nArbitrary Motion\n\nWe now turn back to analyzing the self-forces and self-torques when \u1e45a 6= 0 and na 6= v a . For simplicity, it is\nassumed that the internal dynamics are always 'slow' in the sense of (5.3) and (5.4). It is simple enough to relax (5.5),\nso we also allow the first (and only the first) derivative of H \u03b1 to appear in the self-force. Higher derivatives of both\n\u03c6 and H \u03b1 could be included with relatively little extra effort, although there seems to be little reason for doing so.\n1.\n\nRadiative Self-Forces\n\nAt this point, it is useful to separately write out the retarded and radiative fields. Using (1.3) and (4.17)-(4.21),\n4\nab\n(x) \u2243 \u2212 qn\u0308[a (s)nb] (s) ,\nFself(R)\n3\n\n(5.8)\n\nIf na = v a , then this is the same expression found by Dirac from the Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert potential [12] (we have used\nthe opposite sign convention for the field).\nThe forces and torques exerted by this field are now very simple to calculate. Inserting (5.8) in (A61),\n\u0001\n2 2 \u03b1\n2\n\u22121\n\u03a8\u03b1\n.\nself(R) (s) \u2243 \u2212 q n\u0308 + o \u01eb EM T\n3\n\n(5.9)\n\nThis is just the Lorentz-Dirac force when na = v a (see (1.1)).\nSubstituting (5.8) into (A62), the space-space components of the self-torque are\nZ\n\u0001\n1\n\u03b2]\n[\u03b1\u03b2]\n(5.10)\nd3 r \u03c1(r, s)r[\u03b1 \u03a8self(R) + o \u01eb3 EM .\n\u03a8self(R) (s) \u2243\nq\nR 3\nd r \u03c1r\u03b1 /q can be thought of as the separation vector between the 'charge centroid' and the center-of-mass (r\u03b1 = 0).\nInverting (3.31), we can clearly convert this component of the self-torque into a 3-vector describing the rate of change\n\n\f15\nof S a . In this form, the (vector) self-torque is just the cross product of the self-force with this separation vector.\nWriting it in this way suggests that it arises due to the self-force not acting through the center-of-mass.\nThe time-space components of the self-torque are similar:\nZ\n\u0001\n1\n[ab]\n\u03b2\n3\n(5.11)\n\u03a8self(R) (s)na e\u03b2b \u2243\nd3 r H\u03b1 (r, s)\u03a8\u03b1\n(R)self r + o \u01eb EM .\n2q\n\nThis clearly vanishes if the 'current centroid' coincides with the center-of-mass.\nCombining all of these results with (A57), (3.32), (3.33), and (3.34), one can find that the particle's motion by\nsimultaneously solving\n\u0001\n(5.12)\n\u1e40 \u2243 \u2212na \u03a8aext + o \u01eb2 EM T \u22121 ,\nZ\n\u0001\n4\n[\u03b1\u03b2]\n\u1e60 \u03b1\u03b2 \u2243 \u22122\u03a8ext + q d3 r \u03c1(r, s)r[\u03b1 n\u0308\u03b2] + o \u01eb3 EM ,\n(5.13)\n3\n\u0001\n2 2 \u03b1\n2\n\u22121\nM \u1e45\u03b1 \u2243 \u2212\u03a8\u03b1\n,\n(5.14)\next + q n\u0308 + o \u01eb EM T\n3\n\u0001\n[\u03b1\u03b2]\n[ab]\n2\n\u22121\n.\n(5.15)\nM v\u0307 \u03b1 \u2243 M \u1e45\u03b1 + S \u03b1\u03b2 n\u0308\u03b2 \u2212 \u1e40 v \u03b1 \u2212 4\u03a8ext \u1e45\u03b2 \u2212 2\u03a8\u0307ext e\u03b1\na nb + o \u01eb EM T\n[ab]\n\nIf the external field varies slowly over \u03a3(s) \u2229 W , (A63) and (A64) can be used to approximate \u03a8aext and \u03a8ext .

Still, there must exist some class of charges which do behave in this way, and it is interesting to\ncharacterize it. Before doing so, it must first be mentioned that the s\u0304 in (1.1) is a proper time, while s is not. It is\nclose, though. Letting s = s(s\u0304) and s\u2032 (s\u0304) := ds/ds\u0304,\n1\ns\u2032 = \u221a a ,\nv va\n\u223c 1+o \u01eb\n\n(5.22)\n\n\u0001\n4\n\n.\n\n(5.23)\n\nThe fractional difference between the center-of-mass 4-velocity and v a is therefore of order \u01eb4 . In particular, the\ntriad components of this 4-velocity will differ from v \u03b1 by terms no larger than \u01eb6 . Given the error estimate in (5.21),\nthese differences are negligible whenever E & \u01eb3 .\nThe proper acceleration can now be written in terms of v a and v\u0307 a :\n2\n\nz \u2032\u2032a = s\u2032\u2032 v a + (s\u2032 ) v\u0307 a .\n\n(5.24)\n\n\f16\nIt follows from (5.20) and (5.22) that s\u2032\u2032 \u223c \u01eb4 /T , so z \u2032\u2032a differs from v\u0307 a by terms of this same order. (5.15) then\nimplies that these two quantities are interchangeable whenever E & \u01eb2 .\nApplying similar arguments, our results can be easily compared to the Lorentz-Dirac equation by writing it in the\nform\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\n2 2 \u03b1\nab\n3\n\u22121\nM v\u0307 \u03b1 LD \u2243 \u2212qe\u03b1\nmax(\u01eb, E) ,\n(5.25)\na vb Fext + q n\u0308 + o \u01eb M T\n3 \u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\nab\n+ o \u01eb3 M T \u22121 max(\u01eb, E) .\n(5.26)\nM na v\u0307 a LD \u2243 \u2212qna e\u03b2b v\u03b2 Fext\n\nIn order to avoid overcomplicating the discussion, we shall say that our equations of motion reduce to the LorentzDirac result if M v\u0307 \u03b1 and M na v\u0307 a match (5.25) and (5.26) up to terms of order \u01eb2 M T \u22121 max(\u01eb2 , E). Noting that\nna v\u0307 a = \u2212\u1e45\u03b1 v\u03b1 , (5.19) shows that the the 'temporal component' of the body's acceleration always matches (5.26) to\nthe required accuracy.\nThe same is not true for the spatial acceleration. This shouldn't be too surprising, though, as the LorentzDirac equation was never intended to describe spinning particles. S ab should therefore be set to zero (at least\ninstantaneously) before any reasonable comparison can be made. Even this isn't quite sufficient, though. The\nsituation can be remedied by assuming that\n\u0001\n|S| < \u01ebM D max \u01eb2 , E ,\n(5.27)\n\u0001\nb]c \u03b1 \u03b2\n[a\n2\n2\nQ c Fext ea eb < \u01eb M max \u01eb , E ,\n(5.28)\nb]c\n\nalong with a similar restriction on Q[a c Fext e\u03b1\na nb . Then\n\n\u0001\n|v| < \u01eb2 max \u01eb2 , E ,\n2\n\n|\u1e40 | < \u01eb M T\n\n\u22121\n\n2\n\n\u0001\n\nmax \u01eb , E ,\n\u0001\n|\u1e60| < \u01eb M max \u01eb2 , E .\n2\n\n(5.29)\n(5.30)\n(5.31)\n\nIf E & \u01eb2 , \u1e40 vanishes up to the maximum order that we can calculate it. The same is not necessarily true for \u1e60 \u03b1\u03b2 and\nv \u03b1 , although they remain sufficiently small that (5.25) can now be recovered to the desired accuracy. There therefore\nexists a regime in which the equations of motion derived here reduce to the Lorentz-Dirac equation. Considering z a\nto be the only observable (as would be reasonable for an extremely small particle), this completely recovers the usual\npoint particle result.\nWhile this conclusion is not particularly surprising, it is interesting to note how restrictive the required assumptions\nare. (5.28) is particularly difficult to satisfy. For example, when the force is approximately given by the Lorentz\n\u0001\u22121\n(monopole) expression, external field magnitudes up to \u223c M |q|T\nare allowed. In fields this large, (5.28) implies\nthat the magnitudes of the dipole moment must be less than \u223c \u01ebEqD (when E & \u01eb2 ). This is an extremely limiting\ncondition in cases where the self-energy is small. Given (3.15), there do not appear to be any rigid (\u03c6\u0307 = \u1e22 \u03b1 = 0) or\nnearly rigid charge distributions that could satisfy it. One either needs to choose a very special class of charges, or\nconsiderably restrict the maximum allowable field strength.\nBefore continuing, it should first be mentioned that our definitions of the charge and three-current densities are\n\u0001\nslightly unusual. These quantities would usually be defined with respect to an orthonormal tetrad adapted to z \u2032a s(s\u0304) .\nWe have instead defined these quantities in terms of a tetrad with temporal component na . Translating from one of\nthese definitions to the other would only introduce fractional changes of order \u01eb2 , which are usually irrelevant at our\nlevel of approximation.\n2.\n\nRetarded Self-Forces\n\nab\nab\nab\nab\nIt is generally accepted that detectors placed outside of W will measure Fext\n+ Fself(\u2212)\nrather than Fext\n+ Fself(R)\n.\nBut infinitesimal elements of an extended body cannot 'know' that they are part of a larger whole, so they must\ncouple to this same field. It is therefore reasonable to consider only the retarded self-field 'physical.' Recalling that\nab\nthis is equal to the sum of the radiative and singular self-fields, any relevance of Fself(R)\nitself should be derived by\nshowing the effects of the singular self-field are irrelevant in certain cases.\nTo this end, we now examine the (presumably) realistic case in which the particle interacts with its full retarded\nself-field. Essentially all of the steps in the previous section carry over identically in this case, although most involve\n\n\f17\nconsiderably more calculation. Starting with (3.7), (3.8), and (4.17)-(4.21), the retarded field can be shown to be\n(dropping the '\u2212' subscript)\n( \u0014\n\u0012\nZ\n1\n1\n1\n1\nab\n3 \u2032\n\u2032 \u03b1 [a b]\n1 + \u1e45\u03b2 (r \u2212 r\u2032 )\u03b2 \u2212 (\u1e45\u03b2 (r \u2212 r\u2032 )\u03b2 )2 + R2 |\u1e45|2\nFself (x) \u2243 2 d r 3 \u03c1 \u2212(r \u2212 r ) e\u03b1 n\nR\n2\n8\n8\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1 \u03b2\n1 2 [a b]\n1\nb]\n\u2032\n1\n+\nn\u0308\n\u2212\nR\nn\n\u1e45\n\u1e45\n(3r\n\u2212\nr\n)\n+ \u1e45\u03b2 \u1e45\u03b3 r\u03b2 (r \u2212 r\u2032 )\u03b3 + R2 (r \u2212 r\u2032 )\u03b1 e[a\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0015 \u0010\n\u00112\n\u0001\u0011\n2\n1\n3\u0010 \u03b3\nb]\n\u2212 R3 n\u0308[a nb] \u2212 H \u03b2 + v \u03c3 \u2202\u03c3\u2032 r\u2032\u03b2 \u03c6\n(r \u2212 r\u2032 )\u03b1 e[a\n1 + \u1e45\u03b3 (r + r\u2032 )\u03b3 +\n\u1e45 (r + r\u2032 )\u03b3\n\u03b1 e\u03b2\n3\n2\n8\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n1 \u03b3\n1\n1\n1\nb]\nn\u0308 (r + r\u2032 )\u03b3 + R|\u1e45|2 \u2212 R\u22122 v \u03b3 (r \u2212 r\u2032 )\u03b3\n+ R2 |\u1e45|2 \u2212 \u1e45\u03b3 \u1e45\u03bb r\u03b3 r\u03bb\u2032 + n[a e\u03b2 R2\n8\n2\n2\n3\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1 2\n1 2 [a b]\n1 \u03b3\nb]\n\u2032 \u03b1 [a b]\n\u2032\n+ R2 \u1e45\u03b2 (r \u2212 r\u2032 )\u03b1 e[a\n\u1e45\n+\nR\nn\u0308\n(r\n\u2212\nr\n)\ne\nn\n+\nR\n\u1e45\ne\n1\n+\n\u1e45\n(3r\n+\nr\n)\n\u03b2\n\u03b3\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n)\n\u0015\n1\nb]\nb] \u2032\u03b2\n\u03b2 [a b] 2\n.\n(5.32)\n\u2212 R3 n\u0308[a e\u03b2 + \u03c6\u0307(r \u2212 r\u2032 )\u03b1 e[a\n\u03b1 e\u03b2 r \u2212 \u1e22 n e\u03b2 R\n3\nThe self-force is now obtained by inserting this into (A61), which results in an expression of the form\nZ\n\u03a8aself (s) \u2243 \u2212 d3 r d3 r\u2032 F a (r, r\u2032 , s) ,\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n\u2243 \u2212\nd3 r d3 r\u2032 F a (r, r\u2032 , s) + F a (r\u2032 , r, s) ,\n2\n\n(5.33)\n(5.34)\n\nwhere F a (r, r\u2032 , s) represents the force density exerted by a charge element at r on a charge element at r\u2032 .

For\nexample, the condition |j| . \u01eb\u03c6 could have replaced |j| . \u01eb2 \u03c6 in this section. This would allow for some chargecurrent coupling without introducing undue complexity. Similarly, one might be interested in the case where \u03c6 . \u01ebH,\nor the general scenario where \u03c6 and H \u03b1 are symmetric (or antisymmetric) about r = 0.\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA.\n\nResults\n\nStarting from the fundamental equations (2.1)-(2.4), we have now derived equations of motion describing a very\nwide variety of classical extended charges in flat spacetime. One of our main motivations has been to investigate the\nvalidity of the commonly-held notion that 'small' charges can often be treated as though they were perfectly pointlike.\nBecause of this, the precise implications of each approximation have been emphasized, and all of our results have been\nkept as general as (reasonably) possible.\nTo review, charge distributions were considered where all significant length scales remained of order D(s) within\neach time slice \u03a3(s). An acceleration timescale T \u226b D was then defined to place lower bounds on |\u1e45|\u22121 and |n\u0308|\u22121/2 .\nThis was assumed to relate to the timescales of the body's internal motions as well. Specifically, the s-derivatives of the\n'charge potential' \u03c6 were required to satisfy (5.3) and (5.4). Similar restrictions were placed on the derivatives of H \u03b1\nas well. The last major restriction required that the spin and torque play a relatively small but non-negligible role in\nthe system's behavior. This was formalized by assuming that |n \u2212 v| = |v| remained less than about \u01eb2 = (D/T )2 \u226a 1.\nAll of these assumptions are kinematic, and cannot automatically be assumed to hold without any regard for the sizes\nof the external fields, spin, and so on. Self-consistency is preserved by requiring the angular momentum, force, and\ntorque obey the bounds discussed in Sec. IV A.\nThe restriction given on S ab essentially states that the body's rotational period can't be less than T . The relations\nsatisfied by the force and torque are not quite as simple, though. Both of these quantities depend on J a , so any bounds\nplaced on them must affect the class of allowable current distributions. While this can be taken into account in different\nways, we have chosen to impose restrictions on the dipole moment and the 'relative self-energy' Dem /D = E. If the\nab\ndominant force is just \u2212qFext\nvb , Qab must satisfy (4.37).\nThe bound on E is more complicated to summarize, as it is sensitive to the specific case under consideration.\nThe calculation using the radiative self-field is the least restrictive; allowing all E . 1. One could technically let\nthe electromagnetic radius exceed the physical one in this case, although we take the point of view that this would\nbe too unphysical. Regardless, taking into account the full retarded self-field shows that there exists a significant\nclass of charge distributions where the self-torque will become too large whenever E \u226b \u01eb2 . In scenarios where the\ncharge-current coupling is negligible, the relative self-energy can be of order \u01eb. Still, there are certain special cases\nsuch as spherical symmetry where the restriction on E can be completely relaxed.\nDespite appearances, these assumptions are really no different than the standard slow-motion approximation.\nUsing it, the radiative and retarded self-fields in a neighborhood of W were shown to be approximated by (5.8) and\n(5.32) respectively. These expressions are quite general, and although the retarded field is written using the peculiar\nconstructions of Dixon's theory, it can easily be translated into a more conventional notation by using (3.7) and (3.8).\n(4.17)-(4.21) also provide a convenient starting point for this.\nThese expressions for the fields were then combined with the exact forms of Dixon's equations of motion to yield\nthe results contained in Sec. V. All of the approximations adopted here were therefore applied only to compute the\nfields. In the (unrealistic) case that the body was assumed to couple only to the radiative component of its self-field,\n\n\f21\nthe center-of-mass line was found to evolve according to (5.12)-(5.15). The external forces and torques that appear\nin these expressions are given exactly by (A61) and (A62), or more intuitively by (A63) and (A64).\nIn order to investigate the Lorentz-Dirac limit, it was first necessary to require the particle's radius to be sufficiently\nsmall that the dipole and higher contributions to the external force could be considered negligible without having to\nthrow away the Lorentz-Dirac component of the self-force. This idea was summarized in the condition (5.16), which\ntransformed the equations of motion in the radiative case into (5.17)-(5.21). Recovering the Lorentz-Dirac equation\nwas then seen to require bounding the angular momentum and dipole moment by (5.27) and (5.28) respectively.\nSince this limit is meant to describe a non-spinning particle, the bound on the angular momentum is hardly\nsurprising. (5.28) is rather different, though. It shows that even when ignoring the 'singular' portion of the self-field,\nthe Lorentz-Dirac equation does not apply to all small charge distributions. If a problem were to involve very large\n(external) field strengths and small self-energies, the class of charges which move like a point particle would in fact\nbecome extremely small. Oddly enough, this problem disappears for large self-energies. In these cases, the restriction\non the dipole moment is no stronger than was required for self-consistency of the initial slow-motion assumptions.\nThis issue is made considerably more complex when the body is allowed to interact with its full retarded selffield. Without placing any restrictions on the spin or dipole moment, \u1e45\u03b1 was found to be given by (5.35). This\ninvolves an effective mass m = M + Mem , which involves an electromagnetic contribution given by (5.36). It does\nnot generally remain constant, but rather evolves according to (5.38). There are also self-torques given by (5.39)\nand (5.40). Combining these expressions with (A57) and (3.34) recovers the full equations of motion. These are our\ncentral result. They provide a considerable generalization of the Lorentz-Dirac equation.\nThey are also much more complicated than the equations derived using only the radiative portion of the self-field.\nThe majority of this complexity arises from interactions between \u03c6 and H \u03b1 , which \u2013 given (3.7) and (3.8) \u2013 can\nbe viewed as charge-current couplings in the center-of-mass frame. Predictably then, our results are considerably\nsimplified when only one of these quantities is significant. \u03c6 will (generically) drop out of the equations of motion\nonly if it is of order \u01eb2 H or less. The reverse is also true. Both of these cases were discussed in detail in Sec. VI.\nIt should be emphasized that these restrictions on the relative magnitudes of the charge and current densities are\nexceptionally strong. Simply saying that one of these quantities is much larger than the other without any further\nqualification is not sufficient to remove the coupling terms.\nEven in these cases, though, the previous restrictions on \u03bb, S ab , and Qab must be supplemented by either (6.9)\nor (6.15) in order to recover the Lorentz-Dirac equation. Intuitively, these relations ensure that the 'center-ofelectromagnetic mass' is not too far from r = 0. This is roughly what was already required by (5.28), although the\ntwo conditions are not quite the same.\nNote that the assumptions we have given to be able to derive the Lorentz-Dirac equation are not exhaustive. They\nwere the most obvious choices obtained by examining our general equations of motion, but are slightly more restrictive\nthan necessary. Still, they seem to be reasonably effective for most systems that are not finely-tuned.\nB.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn summary, it was shown that the Lorentz-Dirac limit is rather delicate, and that the radiative self-field is rarely\nan adequate replacement for the retarded one. It is now interesting to speculate how these results might generalize\nin curved spacetime. One might be interested in the motion of a charged particle moving in a background spacetime,\nan uncharged body allowed to generate its own gravitational field, or even the general case of a massive charge. With\nthe exception of this last possibility (which doesn't necessarily follow from the two simpler calculations), such systems\nhave been considered in the past by a number of authors [4, 15, 16, 17, 25, 26, 36]. All of these calculations have either\napplied a point particle ansatz, or considered only very special (though usually astrophysically motivated) classes of\nextended bodies. Both such methods have agreed with each other, although it is clear that some extended bodies\nmust exist which do not move like point particles.\nFinding the scope of the existing MiSaTaQuWa equation [17] \u2013 as well as its generalization \u2013 would likely require\nan analysis similar to the one given here. The methods used in this paper have in fact been chosen specifically for\ntheir ability to be easily applied to fully dynamic spacetimes (except for those used to expand the self-field). To see\nthis, it should first be mentioned that all of the advantages of Dixon's formalism are retained without approximation\nin full general relativity [23, 24].\nThis provides two essential results. The first of these is a natural notion of a center-of-mass line. This definition\nhas been proven to satisfy nearly all of the intuitive notions that one might expect of such an object [29], so it can be\nconsidered a reasonable measure of a particle's 'average' position. Just as importantly, it is exactly determined by a\nfinite number of ordinary differential equations [24, 28]. The analogous equations here were (3.32)-(3.34), and (A57).\nThese expressions are only slightly complicated by the transition to curved spacetime.\nThe second contribution of Dixon's formalism is the set of stress-energy moments itself. These are all contained in\n\n\f22\nthe 'stress-energy skeleton' T\u0302 ab (r, s). Here r is a coordinate in the tangent space of z(s), which is an essential point\nthat was not obvious in flat spacetime. Importantly, the constraints on T\u0302 ab implied by the generalized form of (2.4)\nare exactly the same in all spacetimes. This obviously includes the flat case summarized in the appendix. Just as\n(A24) gave the general form for any current skeleton J\u02c6a satisfying the constraints, one can also find all possible forms\nof T\u0302 ab [23].\nAs with current skeleton, not all of these possibilities are physically reasonable. Some will be singular, and others\nwill have supports extending to spatial infinity. We conjecture that such cases can be removed exactly as they\nwere in the appendix for the current moments. This would leave a set of 'reduced moment potentials' that could\nbe arbitrarily generated from some simple recipe. An automatic byproduct of this reduction process would be a\nrelatively straightforward method of generating T ab from the potentials. The analogous results in this paper were\nthat the current skeleton was determined by the freely-specifiable functions \u03c6 and H\u0304 \u03b1\u03b2 . These in turn generated J a\nvia (3.7), (3.8), and (3.16).\nIn the end, such reduced potentials for the stress-energy moments would serve (in combination with solutions of\nthe ODE's for the linear and angular momenta) as a nearly background-independent way of specifying physically\nreasonable conserved stress-energy tensors. Besides the intrinsic elegance of such a construction, it would also solve\nseveral problems that did not arise in the present paper. The most important of these is the location of the center-ofmass. At any s, this is clearly determined by T ab on \u03a3(s). The definition is highly implicit, however, and it is almost\nalways impractical to apply in practice. Specifying the matter via T\u0302 ab would avoid this problem. Constructing it in\nthe natural way would start with the center-of-mass position. It would also incorporate pa and S ab automatically.\nThese quantities obviously must solve certain differential equations, and writing down a T ab on each time slice with\nthe correct momenta would be extremely difficult with any generality. These issues were the main motivations for\ndiscussing the current moments in so much detail in the appendix, as well as the use of \u03c6 and H \u03b1 throughout this\npaper instead of J a . These choices slightly obscure the results here, but would be essential in any generalization.\nWith this formalism in place, one would then need to compute the metric to find the body's motion. As in the\nelectromagnetic case, this is the most difficult step. Of course, Einstein's equation is considerably more complicated\nthan Maxwell's, so it may be prohibitive to carry out the calculation by hand (except in special cases). Regardless, the\nabove procedure could be integrated into existing numerical relativity codes. This would then allow one to rigorously\nstudy spacetimes with nonsingular matter fields without having to solve the conventional elasticity (or Navier-Stokes)\nequations. The most convenient such systems in this formalism may not represent the most astrophysically interesting\ntypes of matter, although there is no shortage of important problems in numerical relativity where the details of the\nmatter distributions are not a primary concern.\nWhatever the results of such inquiries, our results in electromagnetism can be used to speculate how point particle\nmethods might break down in gravitational self-force problems. For this, it is useful to give an intuitive explanation\nfor such failures in Maxwell's theory. The simplest of these derives from the fact that the center-of-mass does not\ngenerally correspond to anything that could be called a 'center-of-charge.' In these cases, electromagnetic self-forces\neffectively act through a lever arm. This induces a torque, which in turn affects the particle's overall motion. The\nsituation is made particularly complicated when the self-force is broken up into several pieces (as is natural). Each\nsuch piece tends to act through a different point, and there's no particular reason that any of them should coincide\nwith the center-of-mass (although the initial restriction (4.37) on the magnitude of the dipole moment does help).\nIn contrast, one might expect that gravitational self-forces would always act through the center-of-mass; effectively\nremoving this type of effect. This isn't necessarily true, though. The center-of-mass definition only requires that\ntabc nb nc = 0, which does not necessarily mean that tabc completely vanishes. The portion of the self-force acting\nas an effective mass could also produce a significant torque. (A47) shows, however, that tabc does vanish whenever\nS ab \u2192 0. This is the only case in which the MiSaTaQuWa equation can be reasonably expected to hold, so imposing\nit at the start should remove any problems. Since the dipole moment here is entirely dependent on S ab (unlike in the\nelectromagnetic case) it should be relatively easy to arrange for an initially-vanishing angular momentum to remain\nsmall. These sorts of effects might therefore be expected to be less troublesome in gravity than in electromagnetism,\nalthough they will probably still exist.\nThis type of mechanism did not lead to most of the complications found in this paper, however. These were instead\ndue to couplings between the charge and 3-current densities as viewed in the center-of-mass frame. In gravity, the\nsituation could be even worse. Similar interactions might exist between mass, 3-momentum, and stress densities.\nIntuitively, though, it would appear that adopting appropriate energy conditions should considerably soften these\ninteractions.\n\n\f23\nAPPENDIX A: DIXON'S FORMALISM\n1.\n\nCurrent Multipoles\n\nThis portion of the appendix reviews Dixon's decomposition of the electromagnetic current vector into multipole\nmoments. It also derives natural 'potential functions' that can be used to generate sets of moments for all physically\ninteresting current vectors satisfying (2.3). These objects are shown to determine J a in a simple way. The main\nreasons for these constructions are explained in Sec. VII B, although some secondary points are also mentioned in\nSec. III. In short, analogs of these steps would become essential in the gravitational self-force problem, so we include\nthem here to allow a relatively straightforward generalization.\nThe notation here will be that defined in Sec. III. Using it, we can define multipole moments for the current vector.\nSuch objects are usually constructed by integrating a source function against a suitable number of radius vectors.\nDefining ra = xa \u2212 z a (s) for x \u2208 \u03a3(s), one might therefore expect that for n \u2265 0, the 2n-pole moment could be given\nby\nZ\n\u0001\nb1 ***bn a\n(A1)\nQ\n(s) := d4 x rb1 * * * rbn J\u02c6a x \u2212 z(s), s ,\n\nwhere we have assumed the existence of some distribution J\u02c6a (x, s) which is related to J a (x), but has compact support\nin x. This will be called the current skeleton. Note that (A1) automatically implies that\nQb1 ***bn a = Q(b1 ***bn )a\n\n(A2)\n\nfor all n \u2265 1.\nIt is rather cumbersome to keep track of each Q*** directly, so we instead define a generating function\nGa (k, s) := Qa (s) +\n\n\u221e\nX\n(\u2212i)n\nkb1 * * * kbn Qb1 ***bn a (s) .\nn!\nn=1\n\nAn arbitrary multipole moment can now be extracted from this in the usual way:\n\u0011\n\u0010\n.\nQb1 ***bn a (s) = in \u2202 b1 * * * \u2202 bn Ga (k, s)\nk=0\n\n(A3)\n\n(A4)\n\nGa is therefore completely equivalent to the set {Qa , Qba , . . .}.\nAlthough this is a useful property, the definition of Ga is not simply a mathematical convenience. Using (A1) and\n(A3), it can be shown that\nZ\nGa (k, s) = d4 r J\u02c6a (r, s)e\u2212ik*r .\n(A5)\nThe Fourier transform of Ga ,\n\nis therefore proportional to J\u02c6a :\n\ne a (r, s) :=\nG\n\nZ\n\nd4 k Ga (k, s)eik*r ,\n\nea (r, s) = (2\u03c0)4 J\u02c6a (r, s) .\nG\n\n(A6)\n\n(A7)\n\nThis shows that if J a and J\u02c6a equivalent in an appropriate sense, the set of moments can be used to completely\nreconstruct the current vector.\nIn order to relate the current to its skeleton, it is convenient to think of J\u02c6a as a linear functional on the space of\nall C \u221e test functions with compact support (as is typically done in distribution theory). In particular, knowing\nZ\nD\nE\na\n\u02c6\nJ (r, s), \u03c6a (x) := d4 x J\u02c6a (r, s)\u03c6a (x)\n(A8)\n\nfor all suitable test functions \u03c6a (x) can be used to define J\u02c6a . An analogous statement can also be made for J a . These\ntwo objects can then be related to each other by writing hJ a , \u03c6a i in terms of hJ\u02c6a , \u03c6a i. The latter expression depends\n\n\f24\non s, while the former one does not. It is therefore most straightforward to link the two by simply integrating out\nthe s-dependence:\nZ\nD\nE\nD\nE\nJ a (x), \u03c6a (x) =\nds J\u02c6a (r, s), \u03c6a (x) ,\n(A9)\nZ\nD\nE\n1\na\nea (k)e\u2212ik*z(s) .\nds\nG\n(k,\ns),\n\u03c6\n(A10)\n=\n(2\u03c0)4\n\nFollowing [22], we take this (along with (A3)) to define what is meant by saying that that the Q*** 's are 'multipole\nmoments of J a .'\nThis is not unique definition, however. To remove the remaining freedom in a useful way, we simply state Dixon's\nresults [20, 22, 23]. Let\nnb1 Qb1 ***bn\u22121 [bn a] = 0 ,\nQ\n\n(b1 ***bn )\n\n= 0,\n\n(A11)\n(A12)\n\nfor all n \u2265 2. Also assume that the monopole moment has the special form\nQa = qv a ,\n\n(A13)\n\nwhere q is the total charge as it is usually defined.\nNow choose a test function of the form \u03c6a (x) = \u2202a \u03c6(x), with \u03c6(x) itself also a test function. Then (A4), (A10),\nand (A12) can be used to show that\n\u2202a J a , \u03c6\n\n= \u2212 J a , \u2202a \u03c6 ,\nZ\nE\nD\ni\na\n\u2212ik*z(s)\n=\n,\nds\nk\nG\n(k,\ns),\n\u03c6\u0303(k)e\na\n(2\u03c0)4\nZ\n\u0001\n= \u2212 ds qv a (s)\u2202a \u03c6 z(s) ,\nZ\n\u0001\nd\n= \u2212 ds q \u03c6 z(s) .\nds\n\n(A14)\n\nThis must vanish for all \u03c6, which can be ensured by simply requiring that\nq\u0307 = 0 .\n\n(A15)\n\nThis (trivial) evolution equation is the only one implied by (2.3). It can be shown that moments satisfying (A2),\n(A11)-(A13), and (A15) describe any J a with the given properties in a uniquely simple way [20, 22, 23]. A precise\nstatement of the theorem that was proven is contained in [23].\nThese conditions allow a great deal of freedom in choosing different moments. The fact that there is only one\nevolution equation implied by (2.3) does not mean that the higher moments necessarily remain constant. Rather,\nthey can be given an almost arbitrary time dependence. This is a reflection of the fact that we have not yet chosen\nto model any particular type of matter. Specifying how the higher moments change in time is essentially equivalent\nto choosing an equation of state. Although this must be given in order to have a well-defined initial value problem,\nself-forces and self-torques can be written down without ever having to explicitly evaluate the time derivatives of the\ncurrent moments. This allows us to derive equations of motion valid for a very large class of systems.\nIn order to do so, we first need to pick out sets of moments (or equivalently their generating functions) which\nrepresent physically reasonable current vectors. Despite appearances, this cannot be done arbitrarily. Dixon's theorem\nensures that any nonsingular current vector with support W can be described by a set of moments with the given\nproperties, although the reverse is not necessarily true. Extra conditions need to be imposed in order to ensure that\nthe J a associated with any particular Ga (or J\u02c6a ) has the correct smoothness and support properties.\nTo gain some insight into this, fix some test function \u03c6a . From this, construct a second test function \u03c6\u2032a which agrees\nwith \u03c6a everywhere except in an infinitesimal neighborhood of Z. Assume that the support of \u03c6\u2032a does not include Z\nitself. (A3) and (A10) then show that any finite number (and only finite number) of multipoles can be changed without\naffecting hJ a , \u03c6\u2032a i. The same cannot be said for hJ a , \u03c6a i. But for any physical current vector, hJ a , \u03c6\u2032a i \u2243 hJ a , \u03c6a i.\nThis shows that any finite subset of an admissible collection of moments is completely determined by its complement.\nBecause of this, it is not reasonable to impose conditions directly on the individual moments to ensure that their\nea or J\u02c6a , but\nassociated current vector is physically acceptable. Such restrictions are most easily stated in terms of G\n\n\f25\ndoing so first requires finding how J\u02c6a is affected by (A11)-(A13), and (A15). This is now done by finding the general\nform of Ga , and then taking its Fourier transform.\nIt is shown in [23] that the constraint equations are precisely equivalent to requiring that the generating function\nhave the form\nGa (k, s) = Ga(1) (h * k, s) + (n * k)Ga(2) (h * k, s) ,\n\n(A16)\n\nwhere n * k := na k a , (h * k)a = hab k b , and na Ga(2) = 0. Also,\nka Ga (k, s) = qka v a (s) ,\nb]\n\u2202 [a G(2) (h\n\n* k, s) = 0 .\n\n(A17)\n(A18)\n\nIt is now useful to take Fourier transforms of these equations to find their equivalent forms when representing the\nea /(2\u03c0)4 ). G\nea doesn't take on any special form, although (A18) shows that\nmoments by J\u02c6a (= G\n(1)\nD\n\nE\neb] (r, s), \u03c6(r) = 0 .\nrc h[a\nG\nc\n(2)\n\ne a of the form\nThis equation is solved by any G\n(2)\n\n(A19)\n\ne(2) (r, s) ,\nea (r, s) = ha (s)rb G\nG\nb\n(2)\n\n(A20)\n\ne (2) .\ne a (k, s) = G\ne a \u2212 ihab rb nc \u2202c G\nG\n(1)\n\n(A21)\n\ne (2) (Despite the notation, it will shortly be clear that the inverse Fourier transform of G\ne (2) does\nfor all functions G\na\nnot exist in general.). Note that this is not the most general solution of (A19). A term of the form g (n * r, s)\u03b4 3 (h * r)\nea , although we choose to ignore this possibility.\nmay also be added to G\n(2)\nea\nIn any case, (A16) and (A20) give an explicit form for G\nSince Ga(1) and Ga(2) are independent of n * k, their (four-dimensional) Fourier transforms must be proportional to\n\u03b4(n * r). It is therefore natural to define quantities A, B a , and C such that\n\u0010\n\u0011\nea (r, s) = (2\u03c0)4 \u03b4(n * r) A(h * r, s)na + B a (h * r, s) ,\nG\n(A22)\n(1)\ne(2) (r, s) = \u2212i(2\u03c0)4 \u03b4(n * r)C(h * r, s) ,\nG\n\nwhere B a na = 0. Combining these expressions with (A21), J\u02c6a is found to have the form\n\u0010\n\u0011\nJ\u02c6a (r, s) = \u03b4(n * r) A(h * r, s)na (s) + B a (h * r, s) \u2212 \u03b4 \u2032 (n * r)C(h * r, s)hab (s)rb .\nThis is further restricted by (A17), the Fourier transform of which becomes\nE\nD\nE\nD\ne\n,\n\u2202a J\u02c6a (x, s), \u03c6(x) = (2\u03c0)\u22124 i ka Ga (k, s), \u03c6(k)\nD\nE\n= \u2212(2\u03c0)\u22124 qv a (s) e\n1, \u2202a \u03c6(r) ,\nD\nE\n= qv a (s) \u2202a \u03b4 4 (r), \u03c6(r) .\n\n(A23)\n\n(A24)\n\n(A25)\n\nComparing this to the divergence of (A24) shows that\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nq\u03b4 3 (h * r) = A(h * r, s) \u2212 hab \u2202a rb C(h * r, s) ,\n\nqv a \u2202a \u03b4 3 (h * r) = \u2202a B a (h * r, s) .\n\nThe solution to the 'homogeneous' analog of (A26),\n\u0010\n\u0011\nhab \u2202a rb C(0) (h * r, s) = \u2212q\u03b4 3 (h * r) ,\n\n(A26)\n(A27)\n\n(A28)\n\n\f26\nis\nC(0) (h * x, s) = \u2212\n\nq\n,\n4\u03c0|r|3\n\n(A29)\n\nwhere |r|2 := \u2212hab ra rb \u2265 0.

We also have that B a\nsatisfies (A27). This effectively parameterizes all sets of moments satisfying Dixon's constraints.\n(A9) can now be used to relate J\u02c6a to J a . It is convenient to do this in the (r\u03b1 , \u03c4 ) coordinates defined in Sec.

Without loss of generality, we can therefore choose\nq0 = q. \u03c1 will then be admissible if \u03c6(r\u03b1 , s) is a continuous function.\nJ\u02c6a was originally introduced as something with compact support (in ra ), so A, B a , and C must also have compact\nsupport (in r\u03b1 ). Using this along with the requirement that \u03c1 vanish outside W implies that \u03c6 = q/4\u03c0|r|3 in this\nregion. So any choice of \u03c6 which satisfies this 'boundary condition' and is continuous will generate a physically\nreasonable charge density.\na\nFor the 3-current j \u03b1 := e\u03b1\na J , the (necessarily regular) portions contributed by \u03c6 can be temporarily ignored to\nshow that\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0001\nqr\u03b1\n.\n(A37)\nj \u03b1 = N \u22121 B \u03b1 + . . . \u2212 v \u03b2 \u2202\u03b2\n4\u03c0|r|3\n\nThe divergence of this last term is equal to \u2212qv \u03b1 \u2202\u03b1 \u03b4 3 (r) , which exactly cancels the divergence of B \u03b1 given in (A27).\nIt is therefore useful to write B \u03b1 in the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nqr\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\nB = H + v \u2202\u03b2\n,\n(A38)\n4\u03c0|r|3\n\n\f27\nwith H \u03b1 an arbitrary piecewise continuous vector field satisfying \u2202\u03b1 H \u03b1 = 0. This ensures that j \u03b1 is nonsingular.\nWriting out the current in full,\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0001\n(A39)\nj \u03b1 = N \u22121 H \u03b1 + v \u03b2 \u2202\u03b2 r\u03b1 \u03c6 \u2212 r\u03b1 \u03c6\u0307 ,\n\nit is clear that j \u03b1 will have support W if\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\nH = \u2212v \u2202\u03b2\n\n\u0012\n\nqr\u03b1\n4\u03c0|r|3\n\n\u0013\n\n(A40)\n\noutside W . This also guarantees that supp(B \u03b1 ) = W , as required.\nThis completes our study of the current moments. Essentially all physically interesting expansions can be extracted\nfrom a J\u02c6a of the form (A24). A, B a and C are all functions of (r\u03b1 , s), and have support W . C has the form (A30),\nwhere \u03c6 is an arbitrary continuous function equalling q/4\u03c0|r|3 outside of W . (A31) shows that A is also derived from\n\u03c6 (with q0 = q). B a has the form (A38), where H \u03b1 is a piecewise continuous (3-) vector field satisfying \u2202\u03b1 H \u03b1 = 0.\nThe relevant portions of these results are also summarized in Sec. III.\n2.\n\nStress-Energy Moments\n\nLet the multipole moments of T ab be denoted by the set {tbc , tabc , . . . , ta1 ***an bc , . . .}, where t(a1 ***an )bc = ta1 ***an (bc) =\nta1 ***an bc . As with the current moments, it is convenient to keep track of this collection with a generating function\n\u221e\nX\n(\u2212i)n\nG (k, s) :=\nkc1 * * * kcn tc1 ***cn ab (s) .\nn!\nn=0\nab\n\n(A41)\n\n(2.4) inextricably links T ab and J a , so an expression for hT ab , \u03c6ab i as simple as the one for hJ a , \u03c6a i is not possible\nwhile retaining simple constraint and evolution equations. Still, one might expect that hT ab , \u03c6ab i should at least be\nR\neab ). Define a distribution \u03a6\ne ab = \u03a6\ne (ab) to make up the difference:\nproportional to ds hT\u0302 ab , \u03c6ab i (where T\u0302 ab := (2\u03c0)4 G\nT ab , \u03c6ab =\n\nZ\n\nD\nE\ne ab (r, s), \u03c6ab (x) .\nds T\u0302 ab (r, s) + \u03a6\n\n(A42)\n\nAs before, we call all sets {t*** } satisfying (A41) and (A42) 'multipole moments of T ab .' This is not a unique\ne ab were given). Following [20, 23], we will now pick out a set which very simply and\ndefinition, however (even if \u03a6\nnaturally implies (2.4).\nUsing (A14) as a guide, \u2202a T ab , \u03c6b can be found by substituting a test function of the form \u03c6ab = \u2202a \u03c6b into (A42).\nIt is clear that the resulting expression depends on ka Gab , which is analogous to what happened when computing\n\u2202a J a . In that case, (A12) showed that ka Ga depended only on Qa . (2.3) is usually interpreted as an expression of\nglobal charge conservation, so it was not unreasonable that it only restricted the monopole moment. In the case of the\nstress-energy tensor, we expect that (2.4) should have something to say about both the linear and angular momenta\nof the body (i.e. its monopole and dipole moments). We therefore suppose that ka Gab involves only tab and tabc .

If \u2217 F ab is just as smooth as F ab , its precise form is irrelevant [20].\n(A52) now makes it natural to interpret the \u03a8*** 's as multipole moments of the force density exerted on the body.\nWe might therefore expect the net force to be proportional to \u03a8a , and the net torque to \u03a8[ab] .

If we impose one more constraint equation:\n\nfor n \u2265 3, the chosen moments are unique in an appropriate sense. They are also sufficiently general to describe all\nphysically interesting stress-energy tensors [23]. Note that \u03a6ab only depends on J a and F ab , and that the constraint\nequations (A43) and (A58) are independent of these quantities. Portions of the stress-energy tensor which depend on\nthe current have therefore been completely isolated from those which are not.\nChanges in the higher moments may once again be interpreted as 'equation of state' (this identification is actually\nmore direct in this case). Their evolution is not completely arbitrary, however. Besides respecting the constraint\n\n\f29\nequations, they must also be chosen so that T ab remains physically reasonable. These extra restrictions would be\nprovided by analogs of (A36) and (A39). Although these will not be derived here, they can probably be constructed\nin a similar way. The presence of the field makes their derivation more complicated, but it should still be possible to\nrepeat all of the steps carried out with the current moments.\nIt suffices to note that for our purposes, this procedure has resulted in particularly natural definitions for the\nstress-energy moments \u2013 most importantly the linear and angular momenta. It can be shown that the choices made\nhere imply that these momenta are given by (3.1) and (3.2) [20]. Interestingly, the net force and torque do not depend\non Gab in any necessary way. They are apparently as independent of the details of the body's internal structure as\npossible.\nBefore moving on, we can gain some insight into the force moments defined by (A53). Only the first two of these\nare important here, and it is straightforward to show that\nD\nE\n\u03a8a = J\u02c6b (r, s), F ab (x) ,\n(A59)\nD\nE\n\u03a8[ab] = J\u02c6c (r, s), r[a F b]c (x) .\n(A60)\nApplying (A24), these expressions take the more explicit forms\n(\n\u0015)\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\nq\n\u2202\n\u03b2\nab\na\n3\nab\n,\n\u03c6\u2212\neb r\u03b2 F\n\u03a8 =\nd r N Jb F +\n\u2202s\n4\u03c0|r|3\n(\n\u0012\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0015)\nZ\nq\nq\n\u2202\nb]c\nb]c\n\u03a8[ab] =\nd3 r N Jc r\u03b1 e[a\n+ \u03c6\u2212\n,\n\u03c6\u2212\ne\u03b3c r\u03b3 v [a F b]c +\ne\u03b3c r\u03b3 r\u03b1 e[a\n\u03b1F\n\u03b1F\n4\u03c0|r|3\n\u2202s\n4\u03c0|r|3\n\n(A61)\n(A62)\n\nwhich were derived by a different method in Sec. III.\nAlthough (A61) and (A62) are exact, they are rather difficult to interpret. Their meaning is made considerably\nmore transparent if the field can be expanded in a Taylor series inside \u03a3(s) \u2229 W . Then (A59) and (A60) together\nwith (A1) show that\n\u03a8a (s) \u2243\n\nL\n\u0011\nX\n1 c1 ***cl b \u0010\nQ\n,\n\u2202c1 * * * \u2202cl F a b\nn!\nz(s)\n\n(A63)\n\nl=0\n\nL\n\u0011\nX\n1 d1 ***dl ac \u0010\n.\n\u2202d1 * * * \u2202dl F b c\nQ\n\u03a8 (s) \u2243\nn!\nz(s)\nab\n\n(A64)\n\nl=0\n\nWhen F ab is approximately constant throughout the charge, we recover the Lorentz force law, \u1e57a = \u2212\u03a8a \u2243 \u2212qF ab vb .\nUnfortunately, these series are not useful when the field varies considerably over \u03a3(s) \u2229 W . And this is exactly what\nthe self-field does.\nAcknowledgments\n\nI would like to thank Pablo Laguna for reading over this manuscript, and for many helpful discussions leading up\nto the results presented here.
