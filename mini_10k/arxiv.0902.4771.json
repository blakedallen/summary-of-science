The classical, best known theory is the one\ndue to Fueter [7], [8] (see also [6] for recent developments). In recent papers, adopting an approach used by Cullen, the authors introduced a new theory of regular functions for quaternionic\nand Clifford valued functions, [3], [4], [11], [12], [13]. For these new classes of functions, that will\nbe called slice regular (resp. slice monogenic), Cauchy representation formulas were introduced\nin the afore mentioned papers, by means of kernels that are not slice regular (resp. not slice\nmonogenic). Cauchy formulas and Cauchy kernels play a key role in the study of holomorphic\nfunctions and of Fueter regular functions. As in the case of holomorphic functions, Cauchy\nformulas are a crucial tool in the construction of functional calculus for slice regular and slice\nmonogenic functions. In the quaternionic case, the functional calculus is associated to quaternionic operators (see for example [1] and [2]), while in the Clifford algebras case it deals with\nn-tuples of noncommuting operators (see [3], [5]). It is therefore clear that particular attention\nhas to be put in the construction of the Cauchy kernels and the Cauchy formulas for slice regular\n\n1\n\n\ffunctions. In the present paper, we obtain a new Cauchy formula for slice regular functions in\nterms of a regular Cauchy kernel, while the case of slice monogenic functions is treated in [3].\nLet H be the real associative algebra of quaternions with respect to the basis {1, i, j, k}\nsatisfying the relations\ni2 = j 2 = k2 = \u22121, ij = \u2212ji = k,\njk = \u2212kj = i, ki = \u2212ik = j.\nWe will write a quaternion q as q = x0 + ix1 + jx2 + kx3 (xi \u2208 R) its conjugate as q\u0304 =\nx0 \u2212 ix1 \u2212 jx2 \u2212 kx3 , and we will write |q|2 = qq. We will also denote the real part x0 of q by\nRe(q) and its imaginary part ix1 + jx2 + kx3 by Im(q). The symbol S will indicate the 2\u2212sphere\nof purely imaginary, unit quaternions, i.e.\nS = {q = ix1 + jx2 + kx3 | x21 + x22 + x23 = 1}\nand we will often use the fact that any non real quaternion q can be written in a unique way as\nq = x + yI for x, y \u2208 R, y > 0 and I \u2208 S. In particular we will set\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 Im(q)\nif Im(q) 6= 0\nIq =\n|Im(q)|\n\uf8f3\nany element of S otherwise\nNow, to better explain the problem we deal with, we first of all take the case of the regular\nfunctions in the sense of Fueter. Consider the the (left) Cauchy\u2013Fueter operator\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n=\n+i\n+j\n+k\n\u2202 q\u0304\n\u2202x0\n\u2202x1\n\u2202x2\n\u2202x3\n\n(1)\n\nIf U is an open set of H, then a real differentiable function f : U \u2192 H is called (left) Fueter\nregular if\n\u2202\nf (q) = 0.\n\u2202 q\u0304\nfor all q \u2208 U . By writing the units on the right in (1), one obtains the so called right CauchyFueter operator whose kernel gives the right Fueter regular functions. The two theories of left\nand right Fueter regular functions are completely equivalent. The function G(q) defined by\nG(q) =\n\nq \u22121\nq\u0304\n= 4\n2\n|q|\n|q|\n\n(2)\n\nis called the Cauchy\u2013Fueter kernel, it is a generalization of the classical Cauchy kernel for\nholomorphic functions and it is used to find a Cauchy formula. In fact the function G(q) turns\nout to be left and right Fueter regular on H\\{0} and we have that: if S is a four dimensional\ndomain S \u2282 U whose boundary \u2202S is a compact, orientable hypersurface, and if q0 belongs to\nthe interior of S, then\nZ\n1\nG(q \u2212 q0 )Dqf (q)\n(3)\nf (q0 ) = 2\n2\u03c0 \u2202S\nwhere, with obvious notations, Dq is the quaternion valued 3-differential form defined by dx1 \u2227\ndx2 \u2227 dx3 \u2212 idx0 \u2227 dx2 \u2227 dx3 \u2212 jdx0 \u2227 dx3 \u2227 dx1 \u2212 kdx0 \u2227 dx1 \u2227 dx2 .\nWe will now pass to the case of slice regular functions, and we will recall the definition given\nby the authors in [12].\n\n2\n\n\fDefinition 1.1. Let U \u2286 H be an open set and let f : U \u2192 H be a function. Let I \u2208 S and\nlet fI be the restriction of f to the complex line LI := R + IR passing through 1 and I. We say\nthat f is a left slice regular (or regular) function if, for every I \u2208 S\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202I f =\n+I\nfI (x + Iy) = 0,\n2 \u2202x\n\u2202y\nand we say it is right slice regular (or right regular) if for every I \u2208 S\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n1 \u2202\n+\nI fI (x + Iy) = 0.\nf \u2202I =\n2 \u2202x \u2202y\nWe define the I\u2212derivative of f in q = x + yI by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202I f (x + yI) :=\n\u2212I\nfI (x + yI)\n2 \u2202x\n\u2202y\nand we are now able to give the following notion of derivative:\nDefinition 1.2. Let \u03a9 be a domain in H, and let f : \u03a9 \u2192 H be a regular function. The slice\nderivative (in short derivative) of f , \u2202s f , is defined as follows:\n\u2202s (f )(x + yI) = \u2202I (f )(x + yI).\nNotice that the definition of derivative is well posed because it is applied only to regular\nfunctions for which\n\u2202\n\u2202\nf (x + yI) = \u2212I f (x + yI)\n\u2200I \u2208 S,\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\nand therefore, analogously to what happens in the complex case,\n\u2202s (f )(x + yI) = \u2202I (f )(x + yI) = \u2202x (f )(x + yI).\nNote that if f is a regular function, then its derivative is still regular because\n\u2202 I (\u2202s f (x + Iy)) = \u2202s (\u2202 I f (x + Iy)) = 0,\n\n(4)\n\nand therefore\n\n\u2202nf\n(x + yI).\n\u2202xn\nFor R > 0, let now B(0, R) = {q \u2208 H : |q| < R} be the open ball of radius R of H, let\nf : B(0, R) \u2192 H be a slice regular function and let q = x + yIq \u2208 B(0, R). Then the Cauchy\nformula for slice regular quaternionic functions states that ([12])\nZ\n1\nf (q) =\n(\u03b6 \u2212 q)\u22121 d\u03b6Iq f (\u03b6)\n(5)\n2\u03c0 \u2202\u2206q (0,r)\n\u2202sn f (x + yI) =\n\nwhere d\u03b6Iq = \u2212Iq d\u03b6 and r > 0 is such that \u2206q (0, r) := {x + Iq y | x2 + y 2 \u2264 r 2 } contains q and\nis contained in B(0, R).\nIt is easy to prove that the function g(\u03b6) = (\u03b6 \u2212 q)\u22121 is not slice regular unless q \u2208 R. It is\nimportant at the same time to notice that the function g is effectively used only in the complex\nplane LIq which contains the point q. One may wonder if it is possible to consider a variation of\nthe Cauchy formula (5) in which the corresponding kernel is regular and the path of integration\ndoes not depend on the plane LIq to which the point q belongs.\n3\n\n\fThe main results in this paper show that both questions have affirmative answers. The key tool\nused to obtain our results will be the function\n\u2212(q 2 \u2212 2qRe[s] + |s|2 )\u22121 (q \u2212 s)\nwhich turns out to be the regular inverse (s \u2212 q)\u2212\u2217 of Rs (q) = (s \u2212 q) (see [9]). The function\n(s \u2212 q)\u2212\u2217 is, actually, the unique slice regular extension of (s \u2212 q)\u22121 (in the variable q) out of\nLIq and will be called the noncommutative Cauchy kernel. In particular, as a first significant\nstep, formula (5) can be rewritten in terms of the noncommutative Cauchy kernel as\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\n\u22121\nf (q) =\n(\u03b6 \u2212 q) d\u03b6Iq f (\u03b6) =\n(\u03b6 \u2212 q)\u2212\u2217 d\u03b6Iq f (\u03b6)\n(6)\n2\u03c0 \u2202\u2206q (0,r)\n2\u03c0 \u2202\u2206q (0,r)\nwhere, as before, d\u03b6Iq = \u2212Iq d\u03b6 and r > 0 is such that \u2206q (0, r) := {x + Iq y | x2 + y 2 \u2264 r 2 }\ncontains q and is contained in B(0, R). The new Cauchy formula that we present in this paper\nholds naturally for domains - that we will call circular, slice domains - which intersect the real\naxis and are invariant under the action of purely imaginary rotations in H:\nTheorem 1.3. Let \u03a9 \u2286 H be a circular, slice domain such that \u2202(\u03a9 \u2229 LI ) is union of a finite\nnumber of rectifiable Jordan arcs. Let f be a regular function on \u03a9 and, for any I \u2208 S, set\ndsI = \u2212Ids. Then for every q \u2208 \u03a9 we have:\nZ\n1\n\u2212(q 2 \u2212 2Re(s)q + |s|2 )\u22121 (q \u2212 s)dsI f (s).\n(7)\nf (q) =\n2\u03c0 \u2202(\u03a9\u2229LI )\nMoreover the value of the integral depends neither on \u03a9 nor on the imaginary unit I \u2208 S.\nOn circular, slice domains, indeed, the proof of the Cauchy formula is achieved by means of\nthe following representation formula, which is another crucial result obtained in the paper:\nTheorem 1.4. Let f be a regular function on a circular domain \u03a9 \u2286 H. Choose any J \u2208 S.\nThen the following equality holds for all q = x + yI \u2208 \u03a9:\ni\ni\n1h\n1h\n(8)\nf (x + yI) = f (x + yJ) + f (x \u2212 yJ) + I J[f (x \u2212 yJ) \u2212 f (x + yJ)] .\n2\n2\nWe present several other consequent results, and we find the expression of the derivatives of\na regular function in terms of the powers of the regular Cauchy kernel.\n\n2\n\nThe Cauchy formula with regular kernel\n\nWe will recall here the most salient properties of slice regular functions. When no confusion can\narise, we will refer to left slice regular functions simply as regular functions. When it will be\nneeded we will specify if we are considering left or right regularity.\nRemark 2.1. On a domain U \u2286 H, left regular functions form a right H-vector space and right\nregular functions form a left H-vector space. It is not true, in general, that the product or the\ncomposition of two (left/right) regular functions is (left/right) regular.\nP\nn\nOne of the key features of this notion of regularity is the fact that polynomials N\nn=0 q an in\nthe quaternion\nvariable q, and with quaternionic coefficients an ,P\nare left regular (while polynoPN\n+\u221e n\nn are right regular). Moreover, any power series\nmials\na\nq\nn=0 q an (or more in general\nP+\u221e n=0 nn\nn=0 (q \u2212 p0 ) an , p0 \u2208 R) is left regular in its domain of convergence. Conversely, every regular\nfunction on a open ball with center at the origin can be represented by a power series. Indeed\nwe have, [12]:\n4\n\n\fTheorem 2.2. If B = B(0, R) is the open ball centered in the origin with radius R > 0 and\nf : B \u2192 H is a left regular function, then f has a series expansion of the form\nf (q) =\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\nqn\n\nn=0\n\n1 \u2202nf\n(0)\nn! \u2202xn\n\nconverging on B. Analogously, if f is right regular it can be expanded as\nf (q) =\n\n+\u221e\nX\n1 \u2202nf\n(0)q n .\nn\nn!\n\u2202x\nn=0\n\nIn both cases f is infinitely differentiable on B\nIt is straightforward that an analogous statement holds for regular functions in an open ball\ncentered in any p0 \u2208 R. Note that, even though the definition of regular function involves the\ndirection of the unit quaternion I, the coefficients of the series expansion do not depend upon\nthe choice of I.\nA basic result in the theory of regular functions that we will need in the sequel is the following\nversion of the identity principle (see [12]):\nTheorem 2.3 (Identity Principle). Let f : B(0, R) \u2192 H be a regular function.T Denote by\nZf = {q \u2208 B : f (q) = 0} the zero set of f . If there exists I \u2208 S such that LI Zf has an\naccumulation point, then f \u2261 0 on B.\nThe following definitions can be found in [10], and are intended to overcome the difficulties\narising from the facts that product of regular functions, and the conjugate of a regular function,\nare not regular in general.\nP+\u221e n\nP+\u221e n\nDefinition 2.4.

When\nconsidering polynomials in the quaternionic variable q with coefficient on the left (thus right\nregular functions), this definition of regular product coincides with the standard multiplication\nof polynomials with coefficients in a noncommutative ring (see, e.g., [14]).\nP+\u221e n\nDefinition 2.5. Let f (q) =\nn=0 q an be a given quaternionic power series with radius of\nconvergence R. We define:\nP\nn\n- the regular conjugate of f as the series f c (q) = +\u221e\nn=0 q \u0101n\n\n- the symmetrization of f as f s = f \u2217 f c .\nPn\nP+\u221e n\ns\nSince f s (q) =\nn=0 q rn , where rn =\nk=0 ak \u0101n\u2212k \u2208 R for all n \u2208 N, we have that f =\nf \u2217 f c = f c \u2217 f has real coefficients. An analogous definition, that we will use without stating it\nexplicitly, holds for right regular power series.\nThe Cauchy kernel which we will define and study in this paper is inspired by the need to\nhave a suitable Cauchy formula to extend the functional calculus for quaternionic operators to\nfunctions defined on more general domains. Indeed, in the complex case the kernel (\u03b6 \u2212 z)\u22121 is\n5\n\n\fP\nthe sum of the series n\u22650 z n \u03b6 \u22121\u2212n , which is obtained by the standard series development. In\nthe quaternionic case, the same arguments shows\n(s \u2212 q)\u22121 = ((1 \u2212 qs\u22121 )s)\u22121 = s\u22121 (1 \u2212 qs\u22121 )\u22121\nX\nX\n(qs\u22121 )n =\ns\u22121 (qs\u22121 )n .\n= s\u22121\nn\u22650\n\nn\u22650\n\nIf we now fix s = u + vI and take z \u2208 LI with |z| < |s|, the previous expression can be written\nas\nX\n(s \u2212 z)\u22121 =\nz n s\u22121\u2212n .\nn\u22650\n\nThis expression is holomorphic on the disc \u2206 = \u2206(0, |s|) in LI and therefore, it can be extended\nuniquely by the Identity Principle to a regular function on the ball B(0, |s|) in H\nX\nq n s\u22121\u2212n .\nn\u22650\n\nThis explains the meaning of the following definition (see [1], [2]):\nDefinition 2.6. Let q, s \u2208 H such that sq 6= qs. We will call non commutative Cauchy kernel\nseries (shortly Cauchy kernel series) the series expansion\nX\nS \u22121 (s, q) :=\nq n s\u22121\u2212n ,\nn\u22650\n\nfor |q| < |s|.\nProposition 2.7. The Cauchy kernel series is left regular in q and right regular in s, respectively, for |q| < |s|.\nProof. It is an immediate consequence of Theorem 2.2.\nWe will now show two possible approaches to the construction of a regular Cauchy kernel\nfunction. The first one is direct: we compute the Cauchy kernel function and then we show that\nit is regular. The second one makes use of the so called regularization process introduced in [9].\nLet us start by the direct approach introduced, in a different setting, in [1], [2]. In these two\npapers we proved the following:\nTheorem 2.8. Let q and s be two quaternions such that qs 6= sq and consider\nX\nS \u22121 (s, q) :=\nq n s\u22121\u2212n .\nn\u22650\n\nThen the inverse S(s, q) of the quaternion S \u22121 (s, q) is the nontrivial solution to the equation\nS 2 + Sq \u2212 sS = 0.\n\n(9)\n\nRemark 2.9. An algebraic equation with quaternionic coefficients can be suitably rewritten\nwith the coefficients on one side. When algebraic equations are written with coefficients on one\nside, they may have isolated zeroes or 2-dimensional spheres of solutions. In particular, a degree\ntwo equation has either two isolated zeroes or a 2-sphere of zeroes (see e.g. [14]). Since S = 0\nis a trivial solution of (9), also the second solution must be isolated.\n6\n\n\fRemark 2.10. Note that R(s, q) = s \u2212 q is a solution of equation (9) if and only if sq = qs.\nWe have the following result:\nTheorem 2.11. Let q, s \u2208 H be such that qs 6= sq. Then the non trivial solution of\nS 2 + Sq \u2212 sS = 0\n\n(10)\n\nis given by\nS(s, q) = (q \u2212 s)\u22121 s(q \u2212 s) \u2212 q\n= \u2212(q \u2212 s)\u22121 (q 2 \u2212 2qRe(s) + |s|2 ).\n\n(11)\n\nProof. The result has been proved in [2] by directly verifying that S(s, q) is a solution. Here we\nshow how to find the solution using the techniques developed in [15], [16]. We remark that it is\npossible to find the same result also using the so-called Niven's algorithm method which however\ninvolves longer computations. We transform the equation S 2 + Sq \u2212 sS = 0 into another one\nhaving coefficients on the left. Set\nS := W \u2212 q\nand replace it in equation (10) to get\n(W \u2212 q)(W \u2212 q) + (W \u2212 q)q \u2212 s(W \u2212 q) = 0,\nso the equation becomes\nW 2 \u2212 (s + q)W + sq = (W \u2212 s) \u2217 (W \u2212 q) = 0,\nwhere \u2217 denotes the left regularized product. One root is W = q (see [16]), while the second\nroot is W = (q \u2212 s\u0304)\u22121 s(q \u2212 s\u0304), thus S = (q \u2212 s\u0304)\u22121 s(q \u2212 s\u0304) \u2212 s. By grouping (q \u2212 s\u0304)\u22121 on the left\nwe obtain (11).\nDefinition 2.12. The function defined by\nS \u22121 (s, q) = \u2212(q 2 \u2212 2qRe(s) + |s|2 )\u22121 (q \u2212 s\u0304).\n\n(12)\n\nwill be called Cauchy kernel function.\nNote that we are using the same symbol S \u22121 to denote both the Cauchy kernel series and\nthe Cauchy kernel function. Indeed they coincide where they are both defined by virtue of their\nregularity (see Proposition 2.17) and in view of the Identity Principle.\nProposition 2.13. For any q, s \u2208 H such that q 6= s\u0304 the following identity holds:\n(q \u2212 s)\u22121 s(q \u2212 s) \u2212 q = (s \u2212 q\u0304)q(s \u2212 q\u0304)\u22121 + s,\n\n(13)\n\n\u2212 (q \u2212 s)\u22121 (q 2 \u2212 2qRe(s) + |s|2 ) = (s2 \u2212 Re(q)s + |q|2 )(s \u2212 q\u0304)\u22121 .\n\n(14)\n\nor, equivalently,\n\n7\n\n\fProof. One may prove the identities by direct computations but we prefer to follow here a shorter\napproach. Let us solve equation (10) by transforming it into an equation with right coefficients\nby setting\nS := W + s\nand replacing it in the equation. We get\n(W + s)(W + s) + (W + s)q \u2212 s(W + s) = W 2 + W (s + q) + sq = 0.\nThis equation can be split as (W + s) \u2217 (W + q) = 0, where \u2217 denotes the (right) regular product.\nIt is immediate, see [9], that one root is W = \u2212s while the second is W = (\u2212q\u0304 + s)q(\u2212q\u0304 + s)\u22121 .\nThese two roots correspond to S = 0 and S = (s \u2212 q\u0304)q(s \u2212 q\u0304)\u22121 + s which coincides with (11)\nwhen written in the form S = (s2 \u2212 Re(q)s + s2 )(s \u2212 q\u0304)\u22121 .\nAs announced, let us now follow the second approach to find S \u22121 (s, q). When q, s commute,\nthe sum of the Cauchy kernel series is the function R\u22121 (q) = (s \u2212 q)\u22121 . Since this last function\nis, in general, not regular, we construct its regular extension. A crucial point is that the regular\nextension of R\u22121 coincides with the sum of the Cauchy kernel series.\nProposition 2.14. Let f (q) be a regular function in B(0, R). Its inverse with respect to the\nregular product is the function\nf \u2212\u2217 (q) = (f s (q))\u22121 f c (q).\nThe function f \u2212\u2217 is regular on B(0, R) \\ {q \u2208 H : f s (q) = 0}.\nProof. An easy computation shows that\n(f \u2212\u2217 \u2217 f )(q) = (f s (q))\u22121 (f c \u2217 f )(q) = 1.\nP\nn\ns\n\u22121 is\nMoreover, the series expansion f s (q) = +\u221e\nn=0 q rn has real coefficients and hence (f (q))\nregular; indeed, for I \u2208 S, if we set z = x + yI we have:\n\u2202\n\u2202 s\n(f (x + yI))\u22121 = \u2212(f s (x + yI))\u22122 f s (x + yI)\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2202 s\n\u2202\n\u2202\n(f (x + yI))\u22121 = \u2212(f s (x + yI))\u22122 f s (x + yI)I = \u2212I(f s (x + yI))\u22122 f s (x + yI).\n\u2202y\n\u2202y\n\u2202y\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2202\n\u2202\nIt is immediate now to verify that \u2202x\n(f s (x + yI)) = 0 for all I \u2208 S. The regularity of\n+ I \u2202y\n\nf \u2212\u2217 follows by the regularity of f c and by the fact that (f s )\u22121 \u2217 f c = (f s )\u22121 f c since (f s )\u22121 has\nreal coefficients.\n\nRemark 2.15. We point out that (f s )\u22121 \u2217 f c (q) = (f s )\u22121 f c (q) = f c \u2217 (f s )\u22121 (q). If we construct\na regular inverse with respect to the left regularized product, we get an analogous formula where\nthe symbol \u2217 denotes the left regularized product: (f s )\u22121 \u2217 f c (q) = f c \u2217 (f s )\u22121 (q) = f c (f s )\u22121 (q).\nNote that the only difference is the position of f c when using the standard product.\nBy applying the previous proposition to R(s, q) = s \u2212 q we obtain:\nProposition 2.16. The inverse with respect to the regular product of the function R(s, q) =\nRs (q) = s \u2212 q is S \u22121 (s, q).\nProof. We have that Rsc (q) = s\u0304 \u2212 q and Rss (q) = (q 2 \u2212 2Re(s)q + |s|2 ).\n8\n\n\fWe also have:\nProposition 2.17. The function S \u22121 (s, q) is left regular in the variable q and right regular in\nthe variable s in its domain of definition.\nProof. The regularity in q follows by construction. The right regularity in s follows by direct\ncomputations.\nRemark 2.18. The right regular inverse of the function R(s, q) = Rq (s) is the function (s \u2212\nq\u0304)(s2 \u2212 Re(q)s + |q|2 )\u22121 (see remark 2.15) which, by identity (14), coincides with S \u22121 (s, q).\nDefinition 2.19. Given a quaternion q = x + Ip y (x, y \u2208 R and Iq \u2208 S), we will denote by\n\u03a3q = x + Sy the 2\u2212sphere of its (generalized) conjugates.\nNote that the 2-sphere \u03a3q is equivalently defined by the conditions |q| = x2 + y 2 and Re(q) = x.\nProposition 2.20. Let q \u2208 H\\R. The singularities of the function S \u22121 (s, q) = Sq\u22121 (s) =\n\u2212(q 2 \u2212 Re(s)q + |s|2 )\u22121 (q \u2212 s\u0304) lie on the 2-sphere Sq . More precisely: on the plane LI , I 6= Iq\nthe restriction of the function S \u22121 (s, q) to LI has the two singularities Re(q) \u00b1 I|Im(q)|; while\non the plane LIq the restriction of the function S \u22121 (s, q) to LIq has the only singularity q. When\nq \u2208 R, then Sq\u22121 (s) = (q \u2212 s)\u22121 and the only singularity is q.\nProof. Suppose q \u2208 H\\R. The singularities of Sq\u22121 (s) correspond to the roots of |s|2 \u2212 2Re(s)q +\nq 2 = 0. This equation can be written by splitting real and imaginary parts as |s|2 \u22122Re(s)Re(q)+\nRe(q)2 \u2212 |Im(q)|2 = 0, (Re(s) \u2212 Re(q))Im(q) = 0. This implies Re(s) = Re(q) and so |s| = |q| i.e.\nthe singularities consist of the whole 2-sphere \u03a3q . Consider the plane LI , I 6= Iq : it intersects\nthe 2-sphere \u03a3q in Re(q) \u00b1 I|Im(q)|. When I = Iq , or q is real, then q and s commute, so\nSq\u22121 (s) = \u2212(q \u2212 s)\u22121 (q \u2212 s\u0304)\u22121 (q \u2212 s\u0304) = (q \u2212 s)\u22121 and the statement follows.\n\n2.1\n\nThe Cauchy integral formula\n\nIn this section we will present a new Cauchy formula (5), which holds for functions defined on\na larger class of domains.\nLemma 2.21. Let f , g be quaternionic valued, continuously (real) differentiable functions on\nan open set UI of the plane LI .

Let f and g be a left regular and a right regular function, respectively, on an\nopen set U \u2208 H. For any I \u2208 S and every open W \u2282 UI whose boundary consists of a finite\nnumber of piecewise smooth, closed curves, we have:\nZ\ngdsI f = 0.\n\u2202W\n\nWe will now identify a class of domains that naturally qualify as domains of definition of\nregular functions.\nDefinition 2.23. Let \u03a9 \u2286 H be a domain in H. We say that \u03a9 is a slice domain (s-domain for\nshort) if \u03a9 \u2229 R is non empty and if LI \u2229 \u03a9 is a domain in LI for all I \u2208 S.\nA regular function defined on a s-domain has a quaternionic series expansion which converges\nin a small open ball centered at a real point of the domain (see theorem 2.2), and hence it is\nvery easy to prove that the identity principle stated in theorem 2.3 holds for regular functions\ndefined on s-domains. For our purpose here we will also make use of the following\nDefinition 2.24. Let \u03a9 \u2286 H. We say that \u03a9 is circular if, for all x+yI \u2208 \u03a9, the whole 2-sphere\nx + yS is contained in \u03a9.\nWe will focus our attention on the study of regular functions defined on circular s-domains.\nIn fact these functions and domains turn out to be the natural setting of validity of the Cauchy\nformula that we are going to present. To construct this formula, we need now to extend to a\nwider class of regular functions the following value distribution property of regular quaternionic\npower series proved in [9]:\n10\n\n\fP\nTheorem 2.25. Let f : B = B(0, R) \u2192 H defined by f (q) = n\u22650 q n an be a regular function.\nFor all x, y \u2208 R such that x + yS \u2286 B there exist b, c \u2208 H such that\nf (x + yI) = b + Ic\n\n(15)\n\nfor all I \u2208 S.\nWe will in fact prove here the following extension of theorem 2.25 (see [3] for the case of slice\nmonogenic functions):\nTheorem 2.26 (Representation Formula). Let f be an regular function on a circular domain\n\u03a9 \u2286 H. Choose any J \u2208 S. Then the following equality holds for all q = x + yI \u2208 \u03a9:\ni\ni\n1h\n1h\n(16)\nf (x + yI) = f (x + yJ) + f (x \u2212 yJ) + I J[f (x \u2212 yJ) \u2212 f (x + yJ)] .\n2\n2\nMoreover, for all x, y \u2208 R such that x + yS \u2286 \u03a9, there exist b, c \u2208 H such that for all K \u2208 S we\nhave\ni\ni\n1h\n1h\nf (x + yK) + f (x \u2212 yK) = b\nand\nK[f (x \u2212 yK) \u2212 f (x + yK)] = c.\n(17)\n2\n2\nProof. If Im(q) = 0 is real, the proof is immediate. Otherwise let us define the function \u03c8 : \u03a9 \u2192\nH as follows\n1h\n\u03c8(q) = f (Re(q) + |Im(q)|J) + f (Re(q) \u2212 |Im(q)|J)\n2\ni\nIm(q)\n+\nJ[f (Re(q) \u2212 |Im(q)|J) \u2212 f (Re(q) + |Im(q)|J)] .\n|Im(q)|\nUsing the fact that q = x + yI, x, y \u2208 R, y \u2265 0 and I =\n\u03c8(x + yI) =\n\nIm(q)\nwe obtain\n|Im(q)|\n\ni\n1h\nf (x + yJ) + f (x \u2212 yJ) + IJ[f (x \u2212 yJ) \u2212 f (x + yJ)] .\n2\n\nObserve that on LJ (i.e. for I = J) we have\n\u03c8J (q) = \u03c8(x + yJ) = f (x + yJ) = fJ (q).\nTherefore if we prove that \u03c8 is regular on \u03a9, the first part of the assertion will follow from the\nIdentity Principle for regular functions.

Further\ndevelopments will be the subject of a forthcoming paper.\nCorollary 2.27. An regular function f : \u03a9 \u2192 H on a circular s-domain is infinitely differentiable on \u03a9.\nProof. The differentiability of f on the real axis follows from Theorem 2.2 since for any point of\nthe real axis there is a ball in which the function f can be expressed in power series. To prove\ndifferentiability outside the real axis consider formula (16) in terms of q = x0 + ix1 + jx2 + kx3 ,\nnamely\n1h\nf (q) = f (Re(q) + |Im(q)|J) + f (Re(q) \u2212 |Im(q)|J)\n2\ni\nIm(q)\n+\nJ[f (Re(q) \u2212 |Im(q)|J) \u2212 f (Re(q) + |Im(q)|J)] .\n|Im(q)|\nNotice that the function f is regular and hence infinitely differentiable on LJ . It is therefore\nobvious that f can be obtained as a composition of the functions fJ , Re(q), Im(q) and |Im(q)|\nwhich are all infinitely differentiable outside the real axis with respect to the variables xl ,\nl = 0, . . . , 3. This concludes the proof.\nThe following results are geometry-flavored consequences of the above theorem:\nCorollary 2.28. Let \u03a9 \u2208 H be a circular s-domain and let f : \u03a9 \u2192 H be a regular function.\n12\n\n\f1. For all x, y \u2208 R such that x + yI \u2208 \u03a9 there exist b, c \u2208 H such that\nf (x + yI) = b + Ic\n\n(19)\n\nfor all I \u2208 S. In particular the image f (x + yS) of the 2\u2212sphere x + yS is the 2\u2212sphere\nb + Sc.\n2. If f (x + yJ) = f (x + yK) for I 6= K in S, then f is constant on x + yS; In particular,\nif f (x + yJ) = f (x + yK) = 0 for I =\n6 K in S, then f vanishes on the entire 2\u2212sphere\nx + yS.\nProof. The proof of 1. is a direct application of theorem 2.26. To prove 2. notice that f (x+yJ) =\nf (x + yK) for I 6= K implies c = 0 in (19), and hence the assertion follows.\nWe can now prove the new version of the Cauchy formula, which makes use of the class of\ncircular s-domains naturally containing all the singularities of the regular kernel (for the case of\nslice monogenic functions see [3]).\nTheorem 2.29. Let \u03a9 \u2286 H be a circular s-domain such that \u2202(\u03a9 \u2229 LI ) is union of a finite\nnumber of rectifiable Jordan arcs. Let f be a regular function on \u03a9 and, for any I \u2208 S, set\ndsI = \u2212Ids. Then for every q \u2208 \u03a9 we have:\nZ\n1\n(20)\nf (q) =\n\u2212(q 2 \u2212 2Re(s)q + |s|2 )\u22121 (q \u2212 s)dsI f (s).\n2\u03c0 \u2202(\u03a9\u2229LI )\nMoreover the value of the integral depends neither on \u03a9 nor on the imaginary unit I \u2208 S.\nProof. First of all, the integral does not depend on the open set \u03a9. This follows from the right\nregularity of S \u22121 (s, q) with respect to the variable s (see equality (14) and Corollary 2.22).\nLet us show that the integral does not depend on the choice of the imaginary unit I \u2208 S. If\nwe denote q = x + yIq \u2208 \u03a9, then the set of the zeroes of the function q 2 \u2212 2Re(s)q + |s|2 = 0\nconsists of a real point (counted twice) or a 2-sphere. If the zeroes are not real, on any complex\nplane LI we find the two zeroes s1,2 = x\u00b1yI. When the singularity is a real number, the integral\nreduces to the classical Cauchy integral formula for holomorphic maps. Thus we consider the\ncase of nonreal zeroes and we calculate the residues about the points s1 e s2 . Let us start with\ns1 = x + yI setting the positions\ns = x + yI + \u03b5eI\u03b8 ,\nRe(s) = x + \u03b5 cos \u03b8,\ns = x \u2212 yI + \u03b5e\u2212I\u03b8 ,\ndsI = \u2212I[\u03b5IeI\u03b8 ]d\u03b8 = \u03b5eI\u03b8 d\u03b8,\n|s|2 = x2 + 2x\u03b5 cos \u03b8 + \u03b52 + y 2 + 2y\u03b5 sin \u03b8.\nWe now compute the integral which appears at the right hand side of (20) along the circle with\ncenter at s1 and radius \u03b5 > 0 on the plane LI :\nZ 2\u03c0\n\u03b5\n\u2212(\u22122q\u03b5 cos \u03b8 +2x\u03b5 cos \u03b8 +\u03b52 +2y\u03b5 sin \u03b8)\u22121 (q \u2212[x\u2212yI +\u03b5e\u2212I\u03b8 ])\u03b5eI\u03b8 d\u03b8f (x+yI +\u03b5eI\u03b8 )\n2\u03c0I1 =\n0\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\n\u2212(\u22122q cos \u03b8 + 2x cos \u03b8 + \u03b5 + 2y sin \u03b8)\u22121 (q \u2212 [x \u2212 yI + \u03b5e\u2212I\u03b8 ])eI\u03b8 d\u03b8f (x + yI + \u03b5eI\u03b8 ).\n\n0\n\n13\n\n\fFor \u03b5 \u2192 0 we get an expression I10 for the residue at s1\n2\u03c0I10 =\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\n(2q cos \u03b8 \u2212 2x cos \u03b8 \u2212 2y sin \u03b8)\u22121 (yIq + yI)eI\u03b8 d\u03b8f (x + yI)\n\n0\n\nZ\n1 2\u03c0\n=\n(y cos \u03b8Iq \u2212 y sin \u03b8)\u22121 (yIq + yI)eI\u03b8 d\u03b8f (x + yI)\n2 0\nZ 2\u03c0\n1\n(y cos \u03b8Iq + y sin \u03b8)(yIq + yI)[cos \u03b8 + I sin \u03b8]d\u03b8f (x + yI)\n=\u2212 2\n2y 0\nZ 2\u03c0\n1\n[(yIq )2 cos \u03b8 + y 2 sin \u03b8Iq + y 2 cos \u03b8Iq I + y 2 sin \u03b8I][cos \u03b8 + I sin \u03b8]d\u03b8f (x + yI)\n=\u2212 2\n2y 0\nZ\n1 2\u03c0\n=\u2212\n[\u2212 cos \u03b8 + sin \u03b8Iq + cos \u03b8Iq I + sin \u03b8I][cos \u03b8 + I sin \u03b8]d\u03b8f (x + yI)\n2 0\nZ\n1 2\u03c0\n=\u2212\n[\u2212 cos2 \u03b8 \u2212 cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8I + cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8Iq + sin2 \u03b8Iq I + cos2 \u03b8Iq I\n2 0\n\u2212 cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8Iq + cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8I \u2212 sin2 \u03b8]d\u03b8f (x + yI)\nZ\ni\n1 2\u03c0 h\n\u2212 1 + Iq I d\u03b8f (x + yI)\n=\u2212\n2 0\nh\ni\n= \u03c0 1 \u2212 Iq I f (x + yI).\nSo we get the first residue\n\ni\n1h\n1 \u2212 Iq I f (x + yI).\n2\nWith analogous calculation we prove that the residue about s2 is\nI10 =\n\nI20 =\n\ni\n1h\n1 + Iq I f (x \u2212 yI).\n2\n\nBy the classical residues theorem used in the complex plane LI , we have:\nZ\n1\nS \u22121 (s, q)dsI f (s) = I10 + I20 .\n2\u03c0 \u2202(U \u2229LI )\nSince\n\ni\ni\n1h\n1h\n1 \u2212 Iq I f (x + yI) + 1 + Iq I f (x \u2212 yI)\n2\n2\nh\ni\nh\ni\n1\n1\n= f (x + yI) + f (x \u2212 yI) + Iq I[f (x \u2212 yI) \u2212 f (x + yI)] ,\n2\n2\nthe statement now follows from Lemma 2.26.\nI10 + I20 =\n\nCorollary 2.30.

Therefore, we can identify \u2202xn f (q) =\n\u2202sn f (q). To compute \u2202xn f (q),it is enough to compute the derivative of the integrand, since f and\nits derivatives with respect to x are continuous functions on \u2202(U \u2229 LI ).

We have the following equalities:\n(q 2 \u2212 2qu + u2 + v 2 )\u22121 = [(q \u2212 u)2 + v 2 ]\u22121 = v \u22122 [1 + (q \u2212 u)2 v \u22122 ]\u22121\nX\n= v \u22122 [ (\u22121)n (q \u2212 u)2n v \u22122n ].\nn\u22650\n\nBy multiplying the last equality by (q \u2212 u + vI) on the right hand side, we obtain:\nX\nX\nS \u22121 (s, q) =\n(\u22121)n (q \u2212 u)2n+1 v \u22122n\u22122 +\n(\u22121)n (q \u2212 u)2n v \u22122n\u22122 (vI).\nn\u22650\n\nn\u22650\n\nRecalling that (\u22121)n v 2n = (vI)2n is a real number we get:\nX\nX\nS \u22121 (s, q) =\n\u2212(q \u2212 u)2n+1 (vI)\u22122n\u22122 +\n\u2212(q \u2212 u)2n (vI)\u22122n\u22121\nn\u22650\n\nn\u22650\n\nwhich is our statement. The series converges when (25) holds.\n\nReferences\n[1] F. Colombo, G. Gentili, I. Sabadini, D.C. Struppa, A functional calculus in a non commutative setting, Electron. Res. Announc. Math.
