A coalition of agents can\n\u2217\n\nThe material in this paper is based upon work supported by the\nNational Science Foundation under CAREER Award IRI-9703122,\nGrant IIS-9800994, ITR IIS-0081246, and ITR IIS-0121678.\n\nsometimes accomplish things that the individual agents cannot, or can do things more efficiently. However, motivating the agents to abide to a solution requires careful analysis: only some of the solutions are stable in the sense that\nno group of agents is motivated to break off and form a new\ncoalition. This constraint has been studied extensively in cooperative game theory. However, the computational questions\naround this constraint have received less attention. When\nit comes to coalition formation among software agents (that\nrepresent real-world parties), these questions become increasingly explicit.\nIn general, computational complexity could stem from\neach potential coalition having some hard optimization problem. For example, when the agents are carrier companies\nwith their own trucks and delivery tasks, they can save costs\nby forming a coalition (pooling their trucks and tasks), but\neach potential coalition faces a hard optimization problem:\na vehicle routing problem defined by the coalition's trucks\nand tasks. The effect of such hard optimization problems\non coalition formation has been studied by Sandholm and\nLesser [Sandholm and Lesser, 1997]. As in the bulk of research on coalition formation, in this paper we do not address\nthat issue. Rather, we assume that such optimization problems have already been solved (at least the pertinent ones),\nand given this, we characterize the stable feasible outcomes.\nThis has been the focus of most of the work in coalition formation. The contribution of this paper belongs to the relatively new, small set of papers that study the complexity of\ncharacterizing such solutions.\nThe determination of stable solutions has electronic commerce applications beyond automated negotiation as well.\nFor example, consider a large number of companies, some\nsubsets of which could form profitable virtual organizations\nthat can respond to larger or more diverse orders than the individual companies can. Determining stable value divisions\nallows one to see which potential virtual organizations would\nbe viable in the sense that the companies in the virtual organization would naturally stay together. As another example,\nconsider a future online service that determines how much\neach employee of a company should be paid so that the company does not collapse as a result of employees being bought\naway by other companies. The input to this service would\nbe how much subsets of the company's employees would be\npaid if they left collectively (for instance, a whole department\n\n\fcould be bought away). This input could come from salary\ndatabases or a manager's estimate. The computational problem of determining a stable renumeration would be crucial\nfor such a service. Both of these example problems fit exactly under the model that we study in this paper.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,\nwe review the required concepts from cooperative game theory. In Section 3, we define a concise general representation\nfor games in characteristic form that relies on superadditivity, and show that it allows for efficient checking of whether\na given outcome is in the core. In Section 4, we show that\ndetermining whether the core is nonempty is N P-complete\nboth with and without transferable utility. In Section 5, we\ndemonstrate that what makes the problem hard in both cases\nis determining the collaborative possibilities (the set of outcomes possible for the grand coalition), by showing that if\nthese are given, the problem becomes tractable in both cases.\nIn Section 6, we show that for a hybrid version of the problem, where utility transfer is possible only within the grand\ncoalition, the problem remains N P-complete even when the\ncollaborative possibilities are given.\n\n2 Definitions from cooperative game theory\nIn this section we review standard definitions from cooperative game theory, which we will use throughout the paper. In\nthe definitions, we follow the most prevalent advanced textbook in microeconomics [Mas-Colell et al., 1995].\nIn general, how well agents in a coalition do may\ndepend on what nonmembers of the coalition do\n[Bernheim et al., 1987;\n(e.g.\nChatterjee et al., 1993;\nEvans, 1997;\nMilgrom and Roberts, 1996;\nMoreno and Wooders, 1996; Okada, 1996; Ray, 1996]).\nHowever, in cooperative game theory, coalition\nformation is usually studied in the context of\ncharacteristic function games where the utilities\nof the coalition members do not depend on the\n[Kahan and Rapoport, 1984;\nnonmembers'\nactions\nvan der Linden and Verbeek, 1985;\nZlotkin and Rosenschein, 1994;\nCharnes and Kortanek, 1966; Shapley, 1967; Wu, 1977].\n(One way to interpret this is to consider the coalition members' utilities to be the utilities they can guarantee themselves no matter what the nonmembers do [Aumann, 1959;\nTohm\u00e9 and Sandholm, 1999].)\nDefinition 1 Given a set of players A, a utility possibility vector uB for B = {b1 , . . . , bnB } \u2286 A is a vector\n(ub1 , . . . , ubnB ) representing utilities that the players in B\ncan guarantee themselves by cooperating with each other. A\nutility possibility set is a set of utility possibility vectors for a\ngiven set B.\n\n(the value of B) such that\nP B\nB\nub \u2264 v(B)}.\nV (B) = {uB = (uB\nb1 , . . . , ubn ) :\nB\n\nb\u2208B\n\nIt is commonly assumed that the joining of two coalitions\ndoes not prevent them from acting as well as they could have\nacted separately. In other words, the composite coalition can\ncoordinate by choosing not to coordinate. This assumption\nis known as superadditivity.1 We will assume superadditivity throughout the paper. This actually makes our hardness\nresults stronger because even a restricted version of the problem is hard.\nDefinition 4 A game in characteristic form is said to be superadditive if, for any B, C \u2286 A with B and C disjoint, and\nfor any uB \u2208 V (B) and uC \u2208 V (C), we have (uB , uC ) \u2208\nV (B \u222a C). (In the case of transferable utility, this is equivalent to saying that for any B, C \u2286 A with B and C disjoint,\nv(B \u222a C) \u2265 v(B) + v(C).)\nWe now need a solution concept. In this paper, we study\nonly the best known solution concept, which is called the\ncore [Mas-Colell et al., 1995; Kahan and Rapoport, 1984;\nvan der Linden and Verbeek, 1985]. It was first introduced by\nGillies [Gillies, 1953].\nA\nDefinition 5 An outcome uA = (uA\n1 , . . . , un ) \u2208 V (A) is\nblocked by coalition B \u2286 A if there exists\nB\nuB = (uB\nb1 , . . . , ubnB ) \u2208 V (B) such that for all b \u2208 B,\nA\nuB\nb > ub . (In the case of transferable utility, this is equivalent\nto saying that the outcome is blocked by B if v(B) >\nP A\nub .) An outcome is in the core if it is blocked by no coalib\u2208B\n\ntion.\nIn general, the core can be empty. If the core is empty, the\ngame is inherently unstable because no matter what outcome\nis chosen, some subset of agents is motivated to pull out and\nform their own coalition. In other words, requiring that no\nsubset of agents is motivated to break off into a coalition of\nits own overconstrains the system.\nAn example of a game with an empty core is the one with\nplayers {x, y, z}, where we have the utility possibility vectors\nu{x,y} = (2, 1), u{y,z} = (2, 1), and u{x,z} = (1, 2) (and the\nones that can be derived from this through superadditivity).\nThe same example with transferable utility also has an empty\ncore.\nIn the rest of this paper, we will study the question of how\ncomplex it is to determine whether the core is nonempty, that\nis, whether there is a solution or the problem is overconstrained.\n\n3 Representing characteristic form games\nconcisely\n\nDefinition 2 A game in characteristic form consists of a set of\nplayers A and a utility possibility set V (B) for each B \u2286 A.\n\nIn our representation of games in characteristic form, we distinguish between games without transferable utility, where\n\nSometimes games in characteristic form have transferable\nutility, which means agents in a coalition can transfer utility\namong themselves.\n\n1\nWhen superadditivity holds, it is always best for the grand\ncoalition of all agents to form. On the other hand, without superadditivity, even finding the optimal coalition structure (partition\nof agents into coalitions) can be hard [Sandholm et al., 1999;\nLarson and Sandholm, 2000;\nShehory and Kraus, 1998;\nShehory and Kraus, 1996; Ketchpel, 1994].\n\nDefinition 3 A game in characteristic form is said to have\ntransferable utility if for every B \u2286 A there is a number v(B)\n\n\fwe specify some utility possibility vectors for some coalitions, and games with transferable utility, where we specify\nthe values of some coalitions.\nIf the representation of the game specifies V (B) or v(B)\nexplicitly for each coalition B \u2286 A, then the length of the\nrepresentation is exponential in the number of agents. In that\ncase, any algorithm for evaluating nonemptiness of the core\n(as long as it reads all the input) requires time exponential in\nthe number of agents. However, that run time is polynomial in\nthe size of the input (this can be accomplished, for example,\nusing the algorithms that we introduce in Section 5).\nOf course, most characteristic form games that represent\nreal-world settings have some special structure. This usually\nallows for a game representation that is significantly more\nconcise. The complexity of characterizing the core has already been studied in certain very specific concisely expressible families of games before. For example, Faigle et al. study\nthe complexity of testing membership in the core in minimum\ncost spanning tree games [Faigle et al., 1994]. Deng and Papadimitriou study games where the players are nodes of a\ngraph with weights on the edges, and the value of a coalition is determined by the total weight of the edges contained\nin it [Deng and Papadimitriou, 1994]. Deng et al. study an integer programming formulation which captures many games\non graphs [Deng et al., 1997]. All of those results depend\nheavily on concise game representations which are specific\nto the game families under study. Typically, such a family\nof games is played on a combinatorial structure. Cooperative\ngames on combinatorial structures have been systematically\nstudied [Bilbao, 2000].\nAs a point of deviation, we study a natural representation\nthat can capture any characteristic form game.2 Conciseness\nin our representation stems only from the fact that in many\nsettings, the synergies among coalitions are sparse. When\na coalition introduces no new synergy, its utility possibility\nvectors can be derived using superadditivity. Therefore, the\ninput needs to include only the utility possibility vectors of\ncoalitions that introduce synergy. The following definitions\nmake this precise.\nDefinition 6 We represent a game in characteristic form\nwithout transferable utility by a set of players A, and a\nset of utility possibility vectors W = {(B, uB,k )}. (Here\nthere may be multiple vectors for the same B, distinguished\nby different k indices.) The utility possibility set for a\nB\nB\ngiven B \u2286 A is\nS then given by V (B) = {u : u =\nBr\nB1\n(u , . . . , u ), 1\u2264i\u2264r Bi = B, all the Bi are disjoint, and\nfor all the Bi , (Bi , uBi ) \u2208 W }. To avoid senseless cases that\nhave no outcomes, we also require that ({a}, (0)) \u2208 W for\nall a \u2208 A.3\nDefinition 7 We represent a game in characteristic form with\ntransferable utility by a set of players A, and a set of values\nW = {(B, v(B))}. The value for a given B \u2286 A is then\n2\nOur hardness results are not implied by the earlier hardness results for specific game families because it is not possible to concisely\nrepresent those games in our input language.\n3\nSetting the utility to 0 in this case is without loss of generality,\nas we can simply normalize the utility function to obtain this.\n\ngiven by v(B) = max{\n\nP\n\nv(Bi ) :\n\n1\u2264i\u2264r\n\nS\n\n1\u2264i\u2264r\n\nBi = B, all\n\nthe Bi are disjoint, and for all the Bi , (Bi , v(Bi )) \u2208 W }. To\navoid senseless cases that have no outcomes, we also require\nthat ({a}, 0) \u2208 W whenever {a} does not receive a value\nelsewhere in W .\nSo, we only need to specify a basis of utility possibilities,\nfrom which we can then derive the others. This representation integrates rather nicely with real-world problems where\ndetermining any coalition's value is complex. For example, in\nthe multiagent vehicle routing problem, we solve the routing\nproblem for every coalition that might introduce new synergies. When it is clear that there is no synergy between two\ncoalitions (for example, if they operate in different cities and\neach one only has deliveries within its city), there is no need\nto solve the routing problem of the coalition that would result\nif the two coalitions were to merge.\nThe following lemmas indicate that we can also use this\nrepresentation effectively for checking whether an outcome\nis in the core, that is, whether it satisfies the strategic constraints.\nLemma 1 Without transferable utility, an outcome uA =\nA\n(uA\n1 , . . . , un ) \u2208 V (A) is blocked by some coalition if and\nonly if it is blocked by some coalition B through some utility\nvector uB , where (B, uB ) \u2208 W .\nProof: The \"if\" part is trivial. For \"only if\", suppose uA is\nblocked by coalition C through some uC , so that for every\nA\nC\n= (uC1 , . . . , uCr ) where\nc \u2208 C, uC\nc > uc . We know u\nCi\n(Ci , u ) \u2208 W . But then, C1 blocks uA through uC1 .\nThe proof for the same lemma in the case of transferable\nutility is only slightly more intricate.\nLemma 2 With transferable utility, an outcome uA =\nA\n(uA\n1 , . . . , un ) \u2208 V (A) is blocked by some coalition if and\nonly if it is blocked by some coalition B through its value\nv(B), where (B, v(B)) \u2208 W .\nProof: The \"if\" part is trivial. For \"only if\", supposePuA is\nuA\nblocked by coalition C through v(C), so that v(C) >\nc .\nc\u2208C\nP\nv(Ci ) where(Ci , v(Ci )) \u2208 W .\nWe know that v(C) =\n1\u2264i\u2264r\nP P A\nP\nuc , and hence for at\nv(Ci ) >\nIt follows that\n1\u2264i\u2264r c\u2208Ci\n1\u2264i\u2264r\nP A\nuc . But then Ci blocks\nleast one Ci , we have v(Ci ) >\nc\u2208Ci\n\nuA through v(Ci ).\n\n4 Checking whether the core is nonempty is\nhard\nWe now show that with this representation, it is hard to check\nwhether the core is nonempty. This holds both for the nontransferable utility setting and for the transferable utility setting.\nDefinition 8 (CORE-NONEMPTY) We are given a superadditive game in characteristic form (with or without transferable utility) in our representation language. We are asked\nwhether the core is nonempty.\n\n\fWe will demonstrate N P-hardness of this problem by reducing from the N P-complete EXACT-COVER-BY-3-SETS\nproblem [Garey and Johnson, 1979].\nDefinition 9 (EXACT-COVER-BY-3-SETS) We are given\na set S of size 3m and a collection of subsets {Si }1\u2264i\u2264r of S,\neach of size 3. We are asked if there is a cover of S consisting\nof m of the subsets.\nWe are now ready to state our results.\nTheorem 1 CORE-NONEMPTY without transferable utility\nis N P-complete.\nProof: To show that the problem is in N P, nondeterministically choose a subset of W , and check if the corresponding\ncoalitions constitute a partition of A. If so, check if the outcome corresponding to this partition is blocked by any element of W .\nTo show N P-hardness, we reduce an arbitrary EXACTCOVER-BY-3-SETS instance to the following\nCORE-NONEMPTY instance. Let the set of players be\nA = S \u222a {w, x, y, z}. For each Si , let (Si , uSi ) be an element of W , with uSi = (2, 2, 2). Also, for each s \u2208 S,\nlet ({s, w}, u{s,w} ) be an element of W , with u{s,w} =\n(1, 4). Also, let ({w, x, y, z}, u{w,x,y,z}) be an element of\nW , with u{w,x,y,z} = (3, 3, 3, 3). Finally, let ({x, y}, u{x,y})\nwith u{x,y} = (2, 1), ({y, z}, u{y,z}) with u{y,z} = (2, 1),\n({x, z}, u{x,z}) with u{x,z} = (1, 2) be elements of W . The\nonly other elements of W are the required ones giving utility 0 to singleton coalitions. We claim the two instances are\nequivalent.\nFirst suppose there is an exact cover by 3-sets consisting\nof Sc1 , . . . , Scm . Then the following outcome is possible:\n(uSc1 , . . . , uScm , u{w,x,y,z}) = (2, 2, . . . , 2, 3, 3, 3, 3). It is\neasy to verify that this outcome is not blocked by any coalition. So the core is nonempty.\nNow suppose there is no exact cover by 3-sets. Suppose\nthe core is nonempty, that is, it contains some outcome uA =\n(uC1 , . . . , uCr ) with each (Ci , uCi ) an element of W , and\nthe Ci disjoint. Then one of the Ci must be {s, w} for some\ns \u2208 S: for if this were not the case, there must be some s \u2208 S\nwith uA\ns = 0, because the Ci that are equal to Si cannot cover\nS; but then {s, w} would block the outcome. Thus, none\nof the Ci can be equal to {w, x, y, z}. Then one of the Ci\nmust be one of {x, y}, {y, z}, {x, z}, or else two of {x, y, z}\nwould block the outcome. By symmetry, we can without loss\nof generality assume it is {x, y}. But then {y, z} will block\nthe outcome. (Contradiction.) So the core is empty.\nWe might hope that the convexity introduced by transferable utility makes the problem tractable through, for example,\nlinear programming. This turns out not to be the case.\nTheorem 2 CORE-NONEMPTY with transferable utility is\nN P-complete.\nProof: To show that the problem is in N P, nondeterministically choose a subset of W , and check if the corresponding\ncoalitions constitute a partition of A. If so, nondeterministically divide the sum of the coalitions' values over the players,\nand check if this outcome is blocked by any element of W .\n\nTo show N P-hardness, we reduce an arbitrary EXACTCOVER-BY-3-SETS instance to the following\nCORE-NONEMPTY instance. Let the set of players be\nA = S \u222a {x, y}. For each Si , let (Si , 3) be an element of\nW . Additionally, let (S \u222a {x}, 6m), (S \u222a {y}, 6m), and\n({x, y}, 6m) be elements of W . The only other elements of\nW are the required ones giving value 0 to singleton coalitions.\nWe claim the two instances are equivalent.\nFirst suppose there is an exact cover by 3-sets consisting of P\nSc1 , . . . , Scm . Then the value of coalition S is at\nv(Sci ) = 3m. Combining this with the coalileast\n1\u2264i\u2264m\n\ntion {x, y}, which has value 6m, we conclude that the grand\ncoalition A has value at least 9m. Hence, the outcome\n(1, 1, . . . , 1, 3m, 3m) is possible. It is easy to verify that\nthis outcome is not blocked by any coalition. So the core\nis nonempty.\nNow suppose there is no exact cover by 3-sets. Then the\ncoalition S has value less than 3m (since there are no m disjoint Si ), and as a result the value of the grand coalition is less\nthan 9m. It follows that in any outcome, the total utility of at\nleast one of S \u222a {x}, S \u222a {y}, and {x, y} is less than 6m. So\nthis coalition will block. So the core is empty.\nOur results imply that it is computationally hard to make\nany strategic assessment of a game in characteristic form\nwhen it is concisely represented.\n\n5 Specifying redundant information about the\ngrand coalition makes the problem\ntractable\nOur proofs that CORE-NONEMPTY is hard relied on constructing instances where it is difficult to determine what the\ngrand coalition can accomplish. So, in effect, the hardness\nderived from the fact that even collaborative optimization is\nhard in these instances. While this is indeed a real difficulty\nthat occurs in the analysis of characteristic form games, we\nmay nevertheless wonder to what extent computational complexity issues are introduced by the purely strategic aspect of\nthe games. To analyze this, we investigate the computational\ncomplexity of CORE-NONEMPTY when V (A) (or v(A))\nis explicitly provided as (possibly redundant) input, so that\ndetermining what the grand coalition can accomplish can no\nlonger be the source of any complexity.4 It indeed turns out\nthat the problem becomes easy both with and without transferable utility.\nTheorem 3 When V (A) is explicitly provided, CORENONEMPTY without transferable utility is in P.\nProof: The following simple algorithm accomplishes this efficiently. For each element of V (A), check whether it is\nblocked by any element of W .\n4\n\nBilbao et al. have studied the complexity of the core in characteristic form games with transferable utility when there is an oracle\nthat can provide the value v(B) of any coalition B [Bilbao et al., ].\nOur amended input corresponds to asking one such query in addition\nto obtaining the unamended input.\n\n\fFor the transferable utility case, we make use of linear programming.\nTheorem 4 When v(A) is explicitly provided, CORENONEMPTY with transferable utility is in P.\nProof: We decide how to allocate the v(A) among the agents\nby solving a linear program. The core is nonempty if and only\nif the following\nlinear program has a solution:\nP\nui \u2264 v(A);\n\u2022\n1\u2264i\u2264n\nP\nub \u2265 v(B).\n\u2022 For any (B, v(B)) in W ,\nb\u2208B\n\nThe algorithms in the proofs also construct a solution that\nis in the core, if the core is nonempty.\n\n6 Hybrid games remain hard\nNot all complexity issues disappear through having the collaborative optimization problem solution available. It turns\nout that if we allow for hybrid games, where only some coalitions can transfer utility among themselves, the hardness returns. In particular, we show hardness in the case where only\nthe grand coalition can transfer utility. This is a natural model\nfor example in settings where there is a market institution that\nenforces payments, but if a subset of the agents breaks off, the\ninstitution collapses so payments cannot be enforced.\nWe demonstrate N P-hardness of this problem by reducing from the N P-complete NODE-COVER problem [Garey and Johnson, 1979].\nDefinition 10 (NODE-COVER) We are given a graph G =\n(V, E), and a number k. We are asked whether there is a\nsubset of V of size k such that each edge has at least one of\nits endpoints in the subset.\nWe are now ready to state our result.\nTheorem 5 When only the grand coalition can transfer utility,\nCORE-NONEMPTY is N P-complete, even when v(A) is explicitly provided as input.\nProof: To show that the problem is in N P, nondeterministically divide v(A) over the players, and check if this outcome\nis blocked by any element of W .\nTo show N P-hardness, we reduce an arbitrary NODECOVER instance to the following CORE-NONEMPTY instance. Let A = V \u222a {x, y, z}, and let v(A) = 6|V | + k.\nFurthermore, for each edge (vi , vj ), let ({vi , vj }, u{vi ,vj } ) be\nan element of W , with u{vi ,vj } = (1, 1). Finally, for any\na, b \u2208 {x, y, z} (a 6= b), let ({a, b}, u{a,b}) be an element\nof W , with u{a,b} = (3|V |, 2|V |). The only other elements\nof W are the required ones giving utility 0 to singleton coalitions. This game does not violate the superadditivity assumption, since without the explicit specification of v(A), superadditivity can at most imply that v(A) = 6|V | \u2264 6|V | + k.\nWe claim the two instances are equivalent.\nFirst suppose there is a node cover of size k. Consider the\nfollowing outcome: all the vertices in the node cover receive\nutility 1, all the other vertices receive utility 0, and each of\nx, y, and z receives utility 2|V |. Using the fact that all the\n\nedges are covered, it is easy to verify that this outcome is not\nblocked by any coalition. So the core is nonempty.\nNow suppose there is some outcome uA in the core. In\nsuch an outcome, either each of {x, y, z} receives at least\n2|V |, or two of them receive at least 3|V | each. (For if\nnot, there is some a \u2208 {x, y, z} with uA\na < 2|V | and some\nb \u2208 {x, y, z} (b 6= a) with uA\n<\n3|V\n|, and the coalition\nb\n{b, a} will block through u{b,a} = (3|V |, 2|V |).) It follows\nthat the combined utility of all the elements of V is at most k.\nNow, for each edge (vi , vj ), at least one of its vertices must\nreceive utility at least 1, or this edge would block. So the vertices that receive at least 1 cover the edges. But because the\ncombined utility of all the elements of V is at most k, there\ncan be at most k such vertices. So there is a node cover.\nHybrid games, where only some coalitions can transfer\nutility, are quite likely to appear in real-world multiagent\nsettings, for example because only some of the agents use\na currency. Our result shows that for such hybrid games,\neven when the collaborative optimization problem has already been solved, it can be computationally hard to strategically assess the game.\n\n7 Conclusions and future research\nCoalition formation is a key problem in automated negotiation among self-interested agents, and other multiagent applications. A coalition of agents can sometimes accomplish\nthings that the individual agents cannot, or can do things more\nefficiently. However, motivating the agents to abide to a solution requires careful analysis: only some of the solutions\nare stable in the sense that no group of agents is motivated\nto break off and form a new coalition. This constraint has\nbeen studied extensively in cooperative game theory. However, the computational questions around this constraint have\nreceived less attention. When it comes to coalition formation among software agents (that represent real-world parties), these questions become increasingly explicit.\nIn this paper we defined a concise general representation\nfor games in characteristic form that relies on superadditivity,\nand showed that it allows for efficient checking of whether\na given outcome is in the core. We then showed that determining whether the core is nonempty is N P-complete both\nwith and without transferable utility. We demonstrated that\nwhat makes the problem hard in both cases is determining\nthe collaborative possibilities (the set of outcomes possible\nfor the grand coalition), by showing that if these are given, the\nproblem becomes tractable in both cases. However, we then\ndemonstrated that for a hybrid version of the problem, where\nutility transfer is possible only within the grand coalition, the\nproblem remains N P-complete even when the collaborative\npossibilities are given.\nFuture research can take a number of different directions.\nOne such direction is to investigate the complexity of restricted families of games in characteristic form.5 Another\n5\nOne interesting restricted family is that of convex games. In a\nconvex game (with transferable utility), for any B, C \u2286 A, v(B) +\nv(C) \u2264 v(B \u222a C) + v(B \u2229 C), and in such games the core is\nknown to always be nonempty. How complex it is here to construct\n\n\fdirection is to evaluate other solution concepts in cooperative\ngame theory from the perspective of computational complexity under our input representation. A long-term goal is to\nextend our framework for finding a strategically stable solution to take into account issues of computational complexity\nin determining the synergies among coalitions (for example,\nwhen routing problems need to be solved, potentially only\napproximately, in order to determine the synergies).\n\nReferences\n[Aumann, 1959] R Aumann.
