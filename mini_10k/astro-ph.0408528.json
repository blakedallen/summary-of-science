INTRODUCTION\n\nHigh-contrast imaging searches for low-mass companions to nearby and/or young stars have increased dramatically in number since the initial discovery of a\nbrown dwarf companion to a main sequence star (Gl 229)\nthrough direct imaging (Nakajima et al. 1995). One particularly powerful technique is adaptive optics (AO),\nwhich provides the high angular resolution (. 0.1\u2032\u2032 )\nachievable at the diffraction limit of large ground-based\ntelescopes. The widening niche of high-contrast imaging\nopened by recent developments in AO technology implies\nthat not only brown dwarfs but exo-solar planets may be\nwithin the realm of direct imaging. Nowadays nearly every ground-based telescope equipped with an AO system\nhosts an imaging companion-search project. The sudden explosion in interest in this topic has been fueled\nby the success of the radial velocity (r.v.) method in detecting solar system analogs (e.g., Marcy & Butler 1998).\nThrough longer time-lines of observation and higher precision, the sensitivity of r.v. surveys has now extended\noutwards to include planets at semi-major axes &3 AU\n(Carter et al. 2003; Naef et al. 2004), i.e., near the Jovian region in the Solar System. While the sensitivity of direct imaging to \"planetary-mass\" (1\u201313 Jupiter\nmasses (MJ ); Burrows et al. 1997) objects at such separations from Sun-like stars is still extremely limited\ndue to contrast requirements, several higher-mass brown\ndwarf companions have been discovered at wider separations (see compilation in Reid et al. 2001), some at projected distances as small as 14\u201319 AU (Els et al. 2001;\nLiu et al. 2002). High-resolution spectroscopic monitorElectronic address: metchev, lah@astro.caltech.edu\n\ning and direct imaging are thus complementary in searching for sub-stellar companions to stars. Future development of both methods promises to narrow, and eventually close the sensitivity gap between them.\nYoung stars are the most suitable targets for direct\nimaging of sub-stellar companions. At ages of 10\u2013\n100 million years (Myr) the expected brightness ratio in the near IR between a 10 MJup object and\na solar-type star is 10\u22123 \u201310\u22125 (Burrows et al. 1997;\nBaraffe et al. 2003). Modern AO systems can routinely achieve comparable dynamic range at 1\u2032\u2032 separations from bright stars. Hence, for young stars\nwithin 40 pc of the Sun we can probe for massive planets at separations comparable to the giant planet region in our own Solar System. However, few young\nstars are known at such small heliocentric distances.\nThese are constrained to several tens of members of\nyoung moving groups: TW Hya (Rucinski & Krautter\n1983; de La Reza et al. 1989), Tucana/Horologium\n(Zuckerman & Webb 2000; Zuckerman et al. 2001a),\nand \u03b2 Pic (Zuckerman, Song, & Webb 2001b), and\nhave already been targeted with sensitive space-based\nand ground-based AO surveys, which have uncovered 3\u20134 brown dwarf companions (Lowrance 2001;\nLowrance et al. 2003; Neuh\u00e4user & Guenther 2004), but\nno planetary-mass ones.\nBecause contrast and projected separation are the\nlimiting factors in detectability of sub-stellar companions, brown dwarfs, being more luminous than planets,\nare detectable at greater heliocentric distances and at\nsmaller angular separations from their host stars. At\nthe same physical separation from the primary (e.g.,\n50\u2013100 AU), brown dwarf companions should be de-\n\n\f2\n\nMetchev & Hillenbrand\n\ntectable around older (several gigayears [Gyr]) and/or\nmore distant (.200 pc) stars compared to planets, allowing a larger sample of targets. With regard to this,\nwe have commenced a survey of young (<400 Myr)\nsolar-type (F5\u2013K5) stars within 160 pc using the AO\nsystem on the Palomar 5-m telescope. Our survey\nsample is largely a subset of the sample targeted by\nthe Formation and Evolution of Planetary Systems\n(FEPS) Spitzer Legacy Team (Meyer et al. 2004). Although faint primary stars, such as M dwarfs or white\ndwarfs, offer more favorable contrast for imaging substellar companions, we have chosen to limit our sample to solar analogs because of interest in determining\nthe multiplicity statistics of sub-stellar objects around\nother suns. Furthermore, several recent large surveys have already explored the multiplicity of nearby\n(.50 pc) cool stars (Close et al. 2003; Carson et al.\n2003; McCarthy & Zuckerman 2004), or white dwarfs\n(Zuckerman & Becklin 1992; Green, Ali, & Napiwotzki\n2000), while a large sample of F\u2013G stars has not been\nstudied, because of comparatively small numbers in the\nimmediate solar neighborhood.\nPreliminary results from our survey were reported\nin Metchev, Hillenbrand, & Meyer (2002).\nHere we\npresent the strategy of the survey, and the discovery and confirmation of resolved low-mass companions\nto HD 49197, HD 129333 (EK Dra), V522 Per, and\nRX J0329.1+0118. We shall refer to these throughout the paper as HD 49197B, HD 129333B, V522 PerB,\nand RX J0329.1+0118B. For convenience of notation,\na second candidate companion to HD 49197 found to\nbe an unrelated background star will be denoted as\nHD 49197\"C\". The full sample and further results from\nthe survey will be discussed in a later paper.\n2. OBSERVING STRATEGY\n\nThe observations described in this Section are representative of our general survey observing strategy. Table 1 details the imaging and spectroscopic observations\nspecifically for the four objects presented here. The properties of the observed primaries are given in Table 2.\n2.1. Imaging\n2.1.1. First-Epoch Imaging and Survey Sample\nSubdivision\nFirst epoch observations are obtained with the Palomar AO system (PALAO; Troy et al. 2000) in residence at the Cassegrain focus of the Palomar 5-m telescope. Since the summer of 2003 the wavefront sensor runs at frame rates up to 2 kHz, and the system\nroutinely produces diffraction-limited images (0.09\u2032\u2032 at\nKS ) with Strehl ratios in the 30\u201350% range at 2\u03bcm on\nV < 12 guide stars, and up to 75% on V < 7 mag\nguide stars. PALAO employs the Palomar High Angular\nResolution Observer (PHARO; Hayward et al. 2001), a\n1024\u00d71024 pix HgCdTe HAWAII detector with imaging\n(25 mas/pix and 40 mas/pix plate scale) and spectroscopic (R=500\u20132000) capabilities in the near IR. A set\nof coronagraphic spots, Lyot masks and neutral density\n(ND) filters are available to achieve the desired dynamic\nrange.\nOur program entails KS -band (2.15\u03bcm) imaging in the\n25 mas/pix mode (25\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 25\u2032\u2032 field of view) both with and\n\nwithout a 0.97\u2032\u2032 -diameter coronagraphic stop. For high\ndynamic range, long (1 min) coronagraphic images are\ntaken to identify fainter (potentially sub-stellar) companions at separations >0.5\u2032\u2032 . Twenty-four such exposures\nare taken, for a total of 24 min integration per target,\nwith 6 min spent at each of 4 different orthogonal detector orientations (obtained by rotating the Cassegrain\nring of the telescope). For every 6 min of on-target imaging (i.e., at each detector orientation), separate 1-min\ncoronagraphic exposures are taken at five dithered sky\npositions 32\u201360\u2032\u2032 from the star. For high angular resolution (but with lower dynamic range), short (1.4\u20139.8 sec)\nnon-coronagraphic exposures are taken to look for close\ncompanions of modest flux ratio, and to establish relative photometric calibration. The images are taken in\na 5-point dither pattern at the vertices and center of a\nbox 6\u2032\u2032 on a side. A 1%-transmission ND filter is used if\nnecessary to avoid saturation1 . On occasion, a narrowband (1%) Brackett-\u03b3 (2.17\u03bcm) filter is used for higher\nthroughput, instead of the ND 1% filter.\nTo avoid detector saturation and/or decreased sensitivity over a substantial fraction of the image area, stars\nwith bright (\u2206KS < 4) projected companions in the\nPHARO field of view (FOV) were not observed with deep\ncoronagraphic exposures. However, binaries with separation \u2264 0.5\u2032\u2032 were included, as both components of the\nbinary could then be occulted by the coronagraph. This\nnaturally splits our survey sample in two groups: the\n\"deep\" subsample, consisting of essentially single stars\nand close binaries, and the \"shallow\" subsample encompassing the remaining stars. Membership to one of the\ntwo subsamples was assigned at the telescope, when their\nmultiplicity and approximate flux ratio was revealed during the short exposures. The shallow subsample was further expanded to include stars out to 200 pc and/or older\nthan 400 Myr to cover the entire FEPS sample accessible\nfrom the Northern hemisphere.\nShort dithered exposures were taken of all stars, while\nlong coronagraphic exposures were taken only of stars in\nthe deep subsample at KS band. In addition, short J(1.22\u03bcm) and H-band (1.65\u03bcm) exposures were taken of\nall candidate binaries (all stars in the shallow survey, and\nthe < 0.5\u2032\u2032 systems in the deep survey) to allow approximate photospheric characterization of the components.\nIn accordance with the above distinction, HD 49197\nwas observed for a total of 24 min with the coronagraph as a part of the deep survey, while HD 129333\nand RX J0329.1+0118 (with bright candidate companions), and V522 Per (\u03b1 Per member, 190 pc from\nthe Sun; van Leeuwen 1999) were observed only with\nshort exposures. Conditions were photometric during\nthe first epoch observations of HD 49197, V522 Per,\nand RX J0329.1+0118, and unstable during those of\nHD 129333.\n2.1.2. Follow-Up Imaging\nWe obtain second-epoch imaging observations of all\ncandidate companions to check for common proper motion with their corresponding stars. Such were taken for\n1 The ND 1% filter was calibrated photometrically through\nrepeated (17\u201320 per band) observations of 3 program stars\nwith and without the filter, and its extinction was measured at 4.753\u00b10.039 mag at J, 4.424\u00b10.033 mag at H, and\n4.197\u00b10.024 mag at KS .\n\n\fPalomar AO Survey of Young Stars\nHD 129333 with PALAO/PHARO, and for HD 49197,\nV522 Per, and RX J0329.1+0118 with NIRC2 (Matthews\net al., in prep.) and the Keck II AO system (diffraction\nlimit 0.05\u2032\u2032 at KS ; Wizinowich et al. 2000). Conditions\nwere not photometric during follow-up, and only the best\nimages (Strehl ratio S & 40%) were selected for astrometry. HD 129333 was followed up in the narrow-band\nBrackett \u03b3 filter, which allowed higher throughput than\nthe ND 1% filter in the shortest (1.4 sec) PHARO exposures. Given the unstable atmospheric conditions during\nthe second-epoch imaging of HD 129333, this allowed\nus to take high signal-to-noise (S/N ) exposures on timescales that would most finely sample the variations in the\nseeing, and to select only the ones with the best imaging\nquality.\nKeck follow-up is done at JHKS , or at KS L\u2032 if the candidate companion is expected to be bright enough to be\nseen at L\u2032 (given 0.7 < KS \u2212L\u2032 < 2.5 for L and T dwarfs;\nLeggett et al. 2002). Sequences of short (up to 20 sec\nfrom multiple co-adds) dithered non-coronagraphic, and\nlong (1 min) target-sky-target exposures are taken with\na 1\u2032\u2032 - or 2\u2032\u2032 -diameter coronagraph in the same manner as\nwith PHARO, though without detector rotations. The\ncandidate companions are exposed until a S/N ratio\ncomparable to that in the first-epoch PHARO observation is achieved (for similar positional accuracy), up\nto 6 min per filter in J, H, and KS . The total integration time at L\u2032 is up to 10.5 min, which allows\nthe detection of L\u2032 . 15.0 objects. We mainly use\nthe 40 mas/pix (wide) NIRC2 camera (41\u2032\u2032 FOV), which\nseverely under-samples the Keck AO point-spread function (PSF), but is known to suffer from less distortion\nthan the 20 mas/pix (medium) camera over the same\nfield (Thompson, Egami, & Sawicki 2001). Although we\nalso have the option of using the 10 mas/pix (narrow)\ncamera (10\u2032\u2032 FOV) in NIRC2, it does not allow follow-up\nof distant candidate companions, and we avoid using it\nfor consistency with the other NIRC2 observations.\n2.1.3. Imaging Data Reduction\nAll imaging data are reduced in a standard fashion for\nnear IR observations. Flat fields are constructed either\nfrom images of the twilight sky (for the Palomar data), or\nfrom images of the lamp-illuminated dome interior (for\nthe Keck data). A bad pixel mask is created from the\nindividual flats, based on the response of each pixel to\nvarying flux levels. Pixels whose gain deviates by more\nthan 5 sigma from the mode gain of the array are flagged\nas bad. Sky frames for the dithered, non-coronagraphic\nexposures are obtained by median-combining four of the\nfive exposures in the dither pattern (excluding the central\npointing), and rejecting the highest pixel value in the\nstack. The coronagraphic-mode sky frames are mediancombined using an average sigma clipping algorithm to\nremove pixels deviant by more than 5 sigma. The skysubtracted images of each target are divided by the flat\nfield, then registered, and median-combined to create a\nfinal high signal-to-noise (S/N ) image (Figures 1 and 2).\nHowever, photometric and astrometric measurements are\nperformed on the individual reduced images.\nNo PSF stars are observed at either Palomar or Keck.\nWith PHARO at Palomar, median-combined images\nfrom all 4 detector orientations can be used to reproduce an approximate PSF. This approach was chosen to\n\n3\n\nemulate the observation of separate PSF stars of identical brightness and color, while optimizing the time\nspent on science targets. However, we have found that\na simple 180\u25e6 rotation and subtraction technique works\nequally well, and we use that on both the Palomar\nand Keck data. While neither approach eliminates telescopic speckle noise (as could be the case if actual PSF\nstars were observed), both significantly reduce pointsymmetric structure in the PSF.\n2.2. Astrometric Calibration\nThe exact pixel scale of the 25 mas PHARO camera was determined using known binary stars from the\nSixth Orbit Catalog (Hartkopf, Mason, & Worley 2001;\nHartkopf & Mason 2003a): WDS 09006+4147 (grade 1;\nHartkopf, Mason, & McAlister 1996), WDS 16147+3352\n(grade 4; Scardia 1979), WDS 18055+0230 (grade 1;\nPourbaix 2000), and WDS 20467+1607 (grade 4; Hale\n1994).\nThese \"calibration binaries\" are observed\nthroughout our campaign at Palomar at all four detector orientations. The combination of grade 1 (accurately determined, short-period) orbits and grade 4\n(less accurately known, longer-period) orbits was selected\nfrom the list of astrometric calibrators recommended by\nHartkopf & Mason (2003b). Despite the lower quality of\nthe solution for binaries with grade 4 orbits, their periods are generally much longer (889 and 3249 years for\nWDS 16147+3352 and WDS 20467+1607, vs. 21.78 and\n88.38 years for WDS 09006+4147 and WDS 18055+0230,\nrespectively), so their motions are predicted with sufficient accuracy for many years into the future. The mean\npixel scale of PHARO was measured to be 25.22 mas/pix\nwith a 1 sigma scatter of 0.11 mas/pix among measurements of the individual binaries at different detector orientations. This measurement is consistent with,\nthough less precise than our previous determination\n(25.168\u00b10.034 mas/pix; Metchev, Hillenbrand, & White\n2003), which was obtained from only one calibration binary at a single Cassegrain ring orientation. The larger\nscatter of our more recent measurement is indicative of\nthe systematics involved in choosing different calibration\nbinaries, and in observing at more than one detector orientation.\nThe plate scale of the wide NIRC2 camera\nwas calibrated using the binary WDS 15360+3948\n(grade 1; S\u00f6derhjelm 1999). The obtained value of\n39.82\u00b10.25 mas/pix is consistent with the pre-ship measurement of 39.7\u00b10.5 max/pix2 . Because only one binary\nwas used for calibrating NIRC2, a 0.63% error term corresponding to the uncertainty in the semi-major axis of\nthe binary has been added in quadrature to the uncertainty of our measurement.\n2.3. Spectroscopy\n2.3.1. Observations\nSpectroscopy of faint targets in the halos of bright objects is more challenging than spectroscopy of isolated\ntargets. Care needs to be taken to achieve optimum suppression of the scattered light of the bright stars either\nby using a coronagraph (in a manner similar to coronagraphic imaging), or by aligning the slit so as to minimize\n2\n\nSee http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/nirc2/genspecs.html.\n\n\f4\n\nMetchev & Hillenbrand\n\nlight admitted from the halo. Since neither PHARO nor\nNIRC2 allow coronagraphic spectroscopy, when taking\nspectra of faint companions we orient the slit as close as\npossible to 90\u25e6 from the primary-companion axis. Spectra of brighter companions, for which the signal from the\nhalo is negligible compared to that from the target, are\nobtained by aligning the binary along the slit. Given that\nwe often use the F5\u2013K5 IV\u2013V primaries in our sample as\ntelluric standards, such alignment improves our observing efficiency. Sky spectra are obtained simultaneously\nwith the target spectra, by dithering the targets along\nthe slit.\nPromising candidate companions are observed at\nmedium resolution (R = 1000 \u2212 3000) at K and (AO\ncorrection permitting) at J. In PHARO we use the corresponding grism and filter combination (K or J) and the\n40 mas/pix camera, while in NIRC2 we use the K or J filter with the \"medres\" grism, and the wide (40 mas/pix)\ncamera. For K-band spectroscopy in first order with\nPHARO and in fifth order with NIRC2 we achieve complete coverage of the 2.2\u03bcm atmospheric window. For\nJ-band spectroscopy in first order with PHARO the coverage is limited by the size of the detector to a 0.16\u03bcm\nbandwidth. J-band spectroscopy with NIRC2 can cover\nthe entire 1.2\u03bcm window, but the spectrum is split between the fifth and the sixth dispersion orders. To allow\nsimultaneous data acquisition from both orders, we fit\nboth onto the wide camera by clipping the fifth (longerwavelength) order shortward of 1.22\u03bcm and the sixth\n(shorter-wavelength) order longward of 1.28\u03bcm. The\ncombined J-band spectrum has complete coverage between 1.16\u20131.35\u03bcm.\nWe took J and K-band spectra with PHARO\nof HD 129333A/B, J and K spectra with NIRC2\nof V522 PerA/B, and K-band NIRC2 spectra of\nHD 49197A/B and RX J0329.1+0118A/B. For the\nobservations of HD 129333 with PHARO, and of\nRX J0329.1+0118 with NIRC2, the binary was aligned\nalong the slit, whereas spectra of the other two binaries\n(with fainter companions) were obtained by placing each\ncomponent in the slit individually. A 0.26\u2032\u2032 (6.5 pix) slit\nwas used in PHARO, and a 0.08\u2032\u2032 (2 pix) slit was used\nin NIRC2, resulting in spectral resolutions of 1200 at J\nand 1000 at K with PHARO, and 2400 at fifth-order J\n(1.22\u20131.35\u03bcm), 2900 at sixth-order J (1.15\u20131.28\u03bcm), and\n2700 at K with NIRC2.\nFlat fields with the dispersive grisms in place were not\nobtained for any of our spectroscopic observations. Instead, the raw spectra were divided by an imaging flat\nfield, constructed in the same manner as for the imaging\nobservations. The flat-fielded spectra were corrected for\nbad pixels, using the same bad pixel mask as in the imaging case. Strong positive deviations due to cosmic ray\nhits were then eliminated using the L.A. Cosmic Laplacian filter algorithm (van Dokkum 2001). Fringing was\nat a noticeable level (\u224815%) only in spectra obtained\nwith PHARO (of HD 129333), and was reduced to below\n5% by dividing the target spectrum by that of the telluric\nstandard, taken at a nearby position on the detector.\n2.3.2. Spectroscopic Data Reduction\nExtraction of the spectra is performed using\niraf/apextract tasks. To reduce contamination from\nthe halo of the primary in the companion spectra, the\n\nlocal background (arising mostly from the halo) is fit by\na first-order polynomial along the direction perpendicular to the dispersion axis and subtracted during extraction. In addition, the aperture width for the companion\nspectrum is conservatively set to the full width at half\nmaximum of the profile so as to include only pixels with\nmaximum signal-to-noise. Pixels within the aperture\nare summed along detector columns (which are nearly\nperpendicular to the dispersion axis), and the resulting\n\"compressed\" spectrum is traced along the dispersion\naxis by fitting a high order (8 to 15) Legendre polynomial. The tracing step is approximately equal to the slit\nwidth, where at each step the data point is obtained as\nthe sum of 3\u201310 adjacent pixels (1.5\u20133 slit widths; the\nspectra of fainter objects being more heavily averaged)\nin the compressed spectrum. This procedure is found\nto produce consistent results for extractions of multiple dithered spectra of the same companion, indicating\nthat scattered light contamination from the primary has\nbeen reduced to a small level. Nevertheless, in some\ncases of very faint close-in companions, the continuum\nshape is still found to vary noticeably among the individual extractions. We therefore avoid classifying the spectra of the companions based on their continuum shapes,\nbut rely on the relative strengths of narrow absorption\nfeatures (discernible given our resolution) instead (Section 3.3).\nA dispersion solution for each spectrum is obtained\nfrom night sky lines in non-sky-subtracted images, using\nthe task identify and OH emission-line lists available\nin iraf. For the spectra of primaries observed separately (e.g., HD 49197 and V522 Per), whose shallower\n(10\u2013120 sec) exposures do not contain telluric emission\nlines at a high enough S/N to allow the fitting of a dispersion solution, such is derived after registration with\ndeeper (10\u201315 min long) companion spectra taken immediately after those of the primaries. The tasks fxcor\nand specshift are used to cross-correlate and align the\nindividual wavelength-calibrated spectra for a given object. The individual primary and companion spectra are\nthen median-combined using scombine.\nSince the primaries (when earlier than K0) double as\ntelluric standards, their spectra are first corrected for\nphotospheric absorption from atomic hydrogen (H P\u03b2 at\n1.282\u03bcm and H Br\u03b3 at 2.166\u03bcm) by hand-interpolating\nover the absorption with the task splot. Weaker absorption features due to Na I, Ca I, Si I, Al I, and Fe I,\nalthough present in the spectra of our telluric standards,\nare left uncorrected because of blending (at our resolution) with various OH absorption lines in the Earth's\natmosphere. After thus correcting the telluric spectra,\nthe spectra of the companions are divided by those of\nthe telluric standards. Finally, the spectra of the companions are multiplied by black bodies with temperatures\ncorresponding to the spectral types of the telluric standards (based on effective temperature vs. spectral type\ndata from Cox 2000), and boxcar-smoothed by the width\nof the slit.\nThe above reduction procedure applies in exact form\nfor NIRC2 spectra, which do not suffer from fringing. For\nPHARO data, which are noticeably affected by fringing,\nwe divide the individual target spectra by those of the telluric standard before median-combining and wavelength\ncalibration, since fringing depends on detector position,\n\n\fPalomar AO Survey of Young Stars\nnot on the dispersive element.\nReduced spectra for the objects reported here are presented in Figure 3 and 4. The mismatch in the continuum slopes between the fifth- and sixth-order the J-band\nspectra of the companion to V522 Per may be due to our\nuse of imaging, instead of spectroscopic flats.\n3. ANALYSIS\n\n3.1. Photometry\nBroad-band near-IR photometry of the companions is\npresented in Table 3. The measured quantity in each case\nis the relative flux (\u2206J, \u2206H, \u2206KS , \u2206L\u2032 ) of the companion with respect to that of the primary. When the\ncompanions were visible without the coronagraph (in all\ncases except for the close-in companion to HD 49197), the\nfluxes of both components were measured directly from\nthe short-exposure non-coronagraphic images. Flux ratios for the HD 129333, V522 Per, RX J0329.1+0118,\nand HD 49197A/\"C\" systems were obtained from the\nPalomar images in apertures of radii of 0.2\u2032\u2032 (2\u03bb/D at\nKS ). For the photometry of HD 129333B we subtracted\nthe halo of the nearby (0.74\u2032\u2032 ) primary (as detailed in\nSection 2.1.3) to minimize its contribution to the flux\nof the secondary. In the case of the HD 49197A/B system, the 0.95\u2032\u2032 companion is not seen in PHARO images\ntaken without the coronagraph, and only coronagraphic\nexposures were obtained with NIRC2. The magnitude of\nthe companion was obtained with respect to the residual\nflux of the primary seen through the 1\u2032\u2032 NIRC2 coronagraphic spot. The flux measurements were performed\non the PSF-subtracted NIRC2 images in a 0.16\u2032\u2032 -radius\n(3.2\u03bb/D at KS ) aperture. The transmission of the spot\nwas established from photometry of another program\nstar in images taken with and without the 2\u2032\u2032 coronagraph: its extinction was measured at 9.27\u00b10.07 mag at\nJ, 7.84\u00b10.03 mag at H, and 7.19\u00b10.03 mag at KS . The\ncompanion was seen in all 6 one-minute coronagraphic\nexposures at KS , but because of varying photometric\nconditions and proximity of diffraction spikes, it was detected in only 3 out of 6 PSF-subtracted exposures at H,\nand 1 out of 6 at J.\nSky values for each of the observed objects were determined as the centroid of the flux distribution in a 0.1\u2032\u2032 wide annulus with an inner radius larger by \u03bb/D than the\ndistance at which the radial profile of the object fell below the level of the local background. For the primaries\nobserved with PHARO this inner radius was 2.0\u2032\u2032 (20\u03bb/D\nat KS ), while for HD 49197A, the flux of which was measured through the NIRC2 coronagraph, the inner radius\nwas 0.2\u2032\u2032 (5\u03bb/D). For the companions, the inner radius of\nthe sky annulus varied from 2.25\u20134 times the KS diffraction limit, depending on whether the local background\nwas strongly influenced by the halo of the primary (as\nnear HD 49197 and HD 129333), or not. Experiments\nwith varying sky annulus sizes in the two more detached\nsystems (V522 Per and RX J0329.1+0118) showed that\nthe relative photometry between two objects in the same\nimage is preserved to within 0.08 mag for annuli ranging\nbetween 2.25\u201320\u03bb/D in inner radius.\nThe J \u2212H and H \u2212KS colors, and KS magnitudes, are\nderived from the measured relative photometry by adopting the Two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS; Cutri et al.\n2003) magnitudes for the primaries. The KS \u2212 L\u2032 color\n\n5\n\nof the companion to V522 Per was calculated assuming\nKS \u2212 L\u2032 = 0.04 for the F5 V primary (Bessell & Brett\n1988). A near-IR color-color diagram of the detected\ncompanions is presented in Figure 5. Extinction corrections of AJ = 0.087, AH = 0.055, AK = 0.033, and\nAL = 0.016 have been applied to the colors of V522 PerB,\nbased on E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.10 toward the \u03b1 Per cluster\nas measured by Pinsonneault et al. (1998). We have\nadopted AV = 3.1E(B \u2212 V ), and the interstellar extinction law of Cardelli, Clayton, & Mathis (1989).\nBased on the colors and the \u2206KS magnitudes, we can\ninfer that HD 49197\"C\" is a likely F\u2013G background star,\nwhereas the remaining companions are consistent with\nbeing late-type stars associated with their primaries.\n3.2. Astrometry\nThree of the four systems were observed at two different astrometric epochs. RX J0329.1+0118 was observed only once, though prior-epoch astrometric data\nfor it exist from Sterzik et al. (1997). Table 4 details for\neach binary the observed offset and position angle of the\ncompanion from the primary during the first and second\nepochs of observation, as well as the estimated offset and\nposition angle during the first epoch, had the system not\nbeen a common proper motion pair. The estimates are\nextrapolated backwards in time from the second-epoch\nastrometry, which for all except HD 129333 was obtained with NIRC2 on Keck and was more accurate, assuming proper motions from Hipparcos (Perryman et al.\n1997) for HD 49197 and HD 129333, and from Tycho 2\n(H\u00f8g et al. 2000) for V522 Per and RX J0329.1+0118.\nParallactic motions were also taken into account, as they\nare significant for stars . 200 pc at our astrometric precision (several milli-arcsec). The assumed proper motions and parallaxes for all stars are listed in Table 2.\nTo ensure the correct propagation of astrometric errors, the epoch transformations were performed following\nthe co-variant treatment of the problem, as detailed in\nLindegren (1997).\nProper motion diagrams for each object are presented\nin Figures 6\u20138. The first- and second-epoch measurements are shown as solid points with error bars, and\nthe inferred first-epoch position (assuming non-common\nproper motion) is shown only with errorbars. The dashed\nline reflects the combined proper and parallactic motion\nof the primary over the period between the two epochs.\nBelow we discuss the evidence for common proper motion\nin each system.\n3.2.1. HD 49197\nThe existence of the close (0.95\u2032\u2032 ) companion to\nHD 49197 was unappreciated prior to the second-epoch\nimaging: the star was followed up because of the more\ndistant (6.8\u2032\u2032 ) candidate companion (HD 49197\"C\").\nUpon its discovery in the Keck image (Figure 1c), the\nclose companion was recovered in the earlier Palomar\nimage, where a dark circular ring around the core at the\nradial distance of the first Airy null (\u22480.1\u2032\u2032 ) distinguishes\nit from the telescopic speckles (Figure 1b).\nAs is evident from Figure 6, HD 49197B (left panel) is\nmuch more consistent with being a proper motion companion of the primary, than with being an unrelated\nbackground star projected along the same line of sight,\nwhereas the reverse holds for HD 49197\"C\" (right panel).\n\n\f6\n\nMetchev & Hillenbrand\n\nTherefore, we claim that the close-in HD 49197B is a\nbona-fide companion, whereas the more widely-separated\nHD 49197\"C\" is not.\nThe astrometry for HD 49197B from the two observational epochs is not in perfect agreement, perhaps because of its orbital motion around component\nA. At a projected separation of 43 AU, the orbital period will be >240 years (assuming a circular face-on\norbit and a mass of 1.16M\u2299 for the F5 V primary;\nAllende Prieto & Lambert 1999), resulting in a change\nin position angle of <2.6\u25e6 between the two epochs. This\nmay explain the observed discrepancy of 0.64\u25e6 \u00b1 0.47\u25e6 in\nposition angle between the two observations, while the\nchange in separation (2.4\u00b15.8 mas) is consistent with\nbeing zero. Future observations spanning a sufficiently\nlong time-line may be used to determine the dynamical\nmass of the HD 49197A/B system.\n3.2.2. HD 129333\nThe offset positions of the companion to HD 129333\nin the two observations taken 16 months apart are fully\nconsistent with each other, and inconsistent with the object being a background star (Figure 7). HD 129333B\nthus shares the proper motion of the primary, and is a\nbona-fide companion.\n3.2.3. V522 Per and RX J0329.1+0118\nThe astrometry for these two systems (Figure 8) is inconclusive because of their smaller proper motions, insufficient time-span between the observations, and/or less\naccurate astrometry. The likelihood of physical association of the companions with the primaries is investigated\nfrom low-resolution spectroscopy in Section 4.1 below.\n3.3. Spectroscopy\nInfrared spectral classification of M\u2013L dwarfs is done\nmost successfully in the J and H bands, where a\nsuite of indices based on the relative strengths of\nH2 O, FeH, K I, and Na I absorption have been\ndeveloped to characterize their effective temperatures\n(Slesnick, Hillenbrand, & Carpenter 2004; Geballe et al.\n2002; Gorlova et al. 2003; McLean et al. 2003) and surface gravities (Gorlova et al. 2003). However, spectroscopy of cool companions in the bright halos of their\nprimaries is often more difficult at J and H than at\nK, because of larger flux contrast and poorer quality\nof the AO correction at shorter wavelengths. Here we\npresent J-band spectra of the two brighter companions: HD 129333B, and V522 PerB. Cool dwarfs can\nbe classified at K band based on the strength of their\nH2 O absorption shortward of 2.05\u03bcm, the depth of the\nCO 2.29\u03bcm bandhead, and the equivalent width (EW)\nof the Na I 2.21\u03bcm doublet (Kleinmann & Hall 1986;\nAli et al. 1995; McLean et al. 2003; Slesnick et al. 2004).\nEven cooler, late-L and T dwarfs, are best characterized by the strength of their CH4 absorption at >2.20\u03bcm\n(Burgasser et al. 2002; McLean et al. 2003). We present\nK-band spectra of all four companions discussed in this\npaper.\nSpectral types of the detected companions have been\ndetermined following infrared absorption line classification systems at K-band (for Na I, Ca I, CO)\nfrom McLean et al. (2003, spectral types M6V\u2013T8) and\n\nAli et al. (1995, F3V\u2013M6V), and at J-band (for K I\nand Ti I) from Gorlova et al. (2003, M4V\u2013L8) and\nWallace et al. (2000, O7\u2013M6). Luminosity classes are\nbased on the relative strengths of Na I, Ca I, and CO absorption at K band (Kleinmann & Hall 1986), and on the\nstrengths of Mn I, and K I absorption at J (Wallace et al.\n2000; Gorlova et al. 2003).\nWe have avoided the use of temperature-sensitive H2 O\nindices that span large fractions of the spectrum (&4%\ntotal band width, e.g., the H2 OD index of McLean et al.\n(2003), or the H2 O-2 index of Slesnick et al. (2004)) because of their strong dependence on the overall continuum shape of the spectrum, and because of the\nuncertainties in the spectral shapes of faint companions extracted from the halos of bright objects (Section 2.3). We have used the J-band 1.34 \u03bcm H2 O index\nof Gorlova et al. (2003) however, which measures only\nthe onset of H2 O absorption at that wavelength, and is\nnarrow (1.4% band width).\nBelow we analyze the K- and J-band spectra of the\ncompanions to HD 49197, HD 129333, V522 Per, and\nRX J0329.1+0118. The inferred effective temperatures\nand spectral types are provided in Tables 5 and 6.\n3.3.1. K-band Spectroscopy of HD 49197B\nOur spectrum of HD 49197B (Figure 3) shows strong\nCO and H2 O bands characteristic of ultra-cool dwarfs,\nbut lacks a CH4 absorption feature, indicating that it is\nearlier than L8 (Geballe et al. 2002). On the other hand,\nNa I absorption is also absent from the spectrum, pointing to a spectral type of L3 or later (McLean et al. 2003),\nindependent of gravity (cf. Figure 8 in Gorlova et al.\n2003). Following the analysis of R\u223c2000 K-band spectra of M6\u2013T8 dwarfs in McLean et al. (2003), we form\na CO absorption index from the ratio of the median\nflux in an absorbed (2.298\u20132.302 \u03bcm) vs. an unabsorbed\n(2.283\u20132.287 \u03bcm) region of the spectrum. We find\nCO=0.80\u00b10.03 (where the error has been estimated as\nthe quadrature sum of the relative uncertainties of the\nmedian in the two spectral regions), which indicates a\nspectral type of L7 or later. However, the CO index is\nnot very sensitive to L-dwarf temperatures, and varies by\nup to 0.15 (60% of its total range of variation between\nspectral types M5 and T2) within the same spectral type\n(Figure 13 in McLean et al. 2003).\nAlternatively, we can also use the absolute KS -band\nmagnitude of HD 49197B to estimate its spectral type,\nfollowing the empirical relation of Kirkpatrick et al.\n(2000), based on a sample of 24 M and L dwarfs with\nmeasured parallaxes:\nMKS = 10.450+0.127(subclass)+0.023(subclass)2 , (1)\nwhere subclass = \u22121 for M9 V, 0 for L0 V, 1 for L1 V,\netc. The scatter about the fit is approximately 1 subclass. From the inferred apparent KS magnitude of\nHD 49197B, and from the parallax of the primary, we\nobtain MKS = 11.04 \u00b1 0.24 for the secondary, which corresponds to a spectral type of L3\u00b11.5.\nWe assign a final spectral type of L4 with an uncertainty of 1 subclass. This is based on the intersection\nof the results from our spectroscopic analysis, suggesting L3\u2013L7, and from the KS -band absolute magnitude,\npointing to L1.5\u2013L4.5. A spectral type of L4\u00b11 for\nHD 49197B is also consistent with a by-eye comparison of\n\n\fPalomar AO Survey of Young Stars\nits K-band spectrum with the grid of L-dwarf standards\nfrom Leggett et al. (2001).\n3.3.2. K-band Spectroscopy of HD 129333B,\nRX J0329.1+0118B, and V522 PerB\nWe classify the K-band spectra of these companions following the analyses of Ali et al. (1995) and\nKleinmann & Hall (1986), whose data are taken at similar resolutions to ours (R=1380\u20133900 and 2500\u20133100, respectively), and span the F8\u2013M7 spectral type range. We\nemploy the spectral classification sequence of Ali et al.,\nwhose empirically-derived indices are based on a larger\nsample of dwarf stars than in Kleinmann & Hall.\nOur reduced spectra were first shifted to 0 km s\u22121\nheliocentric velocity, where the shift was determined by\nfitting Gaussian profiles to the Na I doublet, and comparing the fitted line centers to their values in the solar spectrum (Mohler 1955). For consistency with the\nAli et al. (1995) spectral classification, we have chosen\nthe same bands for integrating the Na I (2.21\u03bcm) Ca I\n(2.26\u03bcm), and 12 CO(2\u20130) (2.29\u03bcm) absorption. The continuum in the target spectra was fit to three regions\ndevoid of absorption lines: 2.0907\u20132.0951\u03bcm, 2.2140\u2013\n2.2200\u03bcm, and 2.2873\u20132.2925\u03bcm. These have been selected as a combination of the continuum regions used\nby Ali et al. (1995) and Kleinmann & Hall (1986), so as\nto constrain the fit on both sides of the Na I doublet (as\nin Kleinmann & Hall 1986, where the continuum-fitting\nregions are widely-separated from the Na I lines), as well\nas near it (as in Ali et al. 1995, where the continuum is\nconstrained only on the long-wavelength side of the Na I\nlines).\nThe absorption strength in each band was obtained\nas an equivalent width, by integrating the profile of the\nspectrum in the band with respect to a global continuum level defined by the three continuum bands. The\nonly exception is the EW of the 12 CO(2\u20130) first overtone bandhead, for which we have adopted the mean\ncontinuum level of the third continuum band (as in\nKleinmann & Hall 1986 and Ali et al. 1995). The onesigma errors in the EWs were calculated by propagating\nthe r.m.s. noise of the spectrum in the nearest continuum\nband, assuming independent pixel variances. The EWs\nof Na I and Ca I were corrected for corresponding absorption in the spectra of the telluric standards, the EW\nof which (0.84\u00b10.57 \u00c5 for Na I and 1.14\u00b10.36 \u00c5 for Ca I\nin G stars; Ali et al. 1995) was added to that measured\nfor the companions. The final EWs are listed in Table 5.\nTo infer effective temperatures for the companions to\nHD 129333, RX J0329.1+0118, and V522 Per, we employ empirical relations between the strength of K-band\nNa I, Ca I, and CO absorption and effective temperature (Teff ), as determined by Ali et al. (1995, their Table 4). Na and CO produce the most characteristic\nK-band features of cool stars. However, their absorption strengths are inaccurate tracers of temperature for\nstars cooler than 4000 K, and are, in addition, gravitysensitive (Kleinmann & Hall 1986; Gorlova et al. 2003).\nOn the other hand, Ca I transitions in the K-band require the population of higher energy states, and hence\nare more temperature-sensitive. However, their absorption strength is degenerate with the stellar effective temperature: Ca I absorption at 2.26\u03bcm peaks at \u223c3500 K,\nand decreases for higher, and lower effective tempera-\n\n7\n\ntures (Kleinmann & Hall 1986; Ali et al. 1995). This behavior is fit via two separate Teff vs. EW(Ca I) relations\nin Ali et al. (1995). By combining the information from\nCa I with that from Na I and 12 CO(2\u20130), we can break\nthis degeneracy, and use the more temperature-sensitive\nCa I index to constrain the effective temperature for each\nstar to within \u223c300 K (the quoted uncertainty of the Ca I\nindex in Ali et al. 1995). For HD 129333B, with a Ca I\nabsorption strength near the breaking point between the\n\"hot\" and \"cool\" relations, we take the average of the\ntwo estimates. For V522 PerB and RX J0329.1+0118B,\nwhose Na I and CO absorption is indicative of temperatures Teff < 3400 K, we use only the \"cool\" relation.\nThe effective temperatures inferred from Ca I absorption are listed in Table 5. As in Ali et al. (1995), we\nadopt a spectral type vs. effective temperature classification for M dwarfs from Bessell (1991), and obtain\nspectral types of M1, M3, and M4 for HD 129333B,\nRX J0329.1+0118B and V522 PerB, respectively, with\nan uncertainty of 2 spectral subtypes. A visual inspection and comparison of the strengths of the various absorption features with K-band spectral sequences from\nLeggett et al. (2001) and Wallace & Hinkle (1997) confirms these results. Given the comparable values of their\nNa I and 12 CO(2\u20130) EWs, all stars have likely dwarf\ngravities (cf. Figure 7 in Kleinmann & Hall 1986).\n3.3.3. J-band Spectroscopy of HD 129333B and\nV522 PerB\nWe further constrain the spectral types of HD 129333B\nand of V522 PerB from their J-band spectra. These\nshow the characteristic absorption features of M stars:\nK I lines at 1.169\u03bcm, 1.177\u03bcm, 1.243\u03bcm, and 1.252\u03bcm,\nFe I at 1.188\u03bcm and 1.197\u03bcm, Na I at 1.268\u03bcm, Al I\nat 1.312\u03bcm and 1.315\u03bcm, and H2 O absorption at \u03bb >\n1.34\u03bcm (Figure 4). The spectrum of V522 PerB exhibits\nalso Ti I and Mn I absorption over 1.282\u20131.298 \u03bcm.\nSpectral classification at J band was done based on\nthe depth of the H2 O and K I absorption, following\nthe index definitions of Gorlova et al. (2003). After resampling our data to match the R\u2248350 spectral resolution of Gorlova et al., we form the 1.34\u03bcm water index as the ratio of the mean fluxes (in a 0.004 \u03bcm wide\nregion) at 1.336\u03bcm and at 1.322\u03bcm, and we measure\nthe K I EW by integrating the absorption over the region 1.2375\u20131.2575\u03bcm. Because K I absorption in the\nsolar-like photospheres of the telluric standards is small\n(EW (K I \u03bb1.14\u03bcm) \u2248 0.1\u00d7EW (Na I \u03bb2.21\u03bcm) = 0.08 \u00c5\nfor the Sun; Mohler 1955; Ali et al. 1995), the K I EW\nmeasurements of the companions were not corrected for\nit.\nFor HD 129333B, we cannot estimate the strength\nof the 1.34\u03bcm water absorption because of insufficient\nspectral coverage. The EW of K I indicates a spectral\ntype of M2\u2013M4. Averaging this with our K-band estimate of M1\u00b12, we assign a spectral type of M2\u00b11 for\nHD 129333B. Given the youth of HD 129333 (<120 Myr;\nsee Section 4.2), the companion may have lower-thandwarf gravity. The effect of this on alkali absorption\nlines in the near IR is degenerate with temperature\n(Gorlova et al. 2003; McGovern et al. 2004), and could\nbe compensated by a later spectral type. However, spectral types later than M3 are inconsistent with the depth\nof the strongly temperature-sensitive Ca I absorption in\n\n\f8\n\nMetchev & Hillenbrand\n\nthis star (Section 3.3.2). In addition, HD 129333B lacks\nnoticeable Mn I absorption, which is weak in M dwarfs\nbut grows deeper with decreasing surface gravity in M\nstars (Fig. 9 in Wallace et al. 2000). Hence, we conclude\nthat HD 129333B is a M2\u00b11 dwarf.\nFor V522 PerB, both the K I EW and the water absorption index point to a spectral type of M3\u2013M5, in agreement with our K-band estimate (M4\u00b12). The stronger\nTi I absorption than in HD 129333B is also consistent\nwith a cooler photosphere. We thus assign a spectral\ntype of M4\u00b11 to V522 PerB. The strength of the Mn I\ntransition indicates a potentially subgiant surface gravity, though as noted in Section 3.3.2, the effect is not\nseen at K band.\n4. DISCUSSION\n\n4.1. Likelihood of Physical Association\nOur astrometric follow-up of HD 49197B and\nHD 129333B confirmed common proper motion between\nthese two companions and their respective primaries.\nHowever, the smaller proper motions of V522 Per and\nRX J0329.1+0118 prevented us from concluding the\nsame for their respective companions, given the timespan of our observations. The probability of physical\nassociation in these systems can be inferred from the\nspectroscopically determined spectral types and absolute\nmagnitudes of the companions. If the absolute magnitude inferred from the spectral type of a companion\nagrees with its measured apparent magnitude at the heliocentric distance of the respective primary, then the\ncompanion is likely to be a bona-fide one (modulo the\nspace density of stars of similar spectral type as the companion).\nFigure 9 presents a comparison of the spectroscopic vs.\nphotometric absolute magnitudes. The correspondence\nis good for the four companions followed up via near IR\nspectroscopy, indicating that they are at similar heliocentric distances as their primaries, and are thus likely\nto be physically bound to them. The location of the remaining candidate companion (HD 49197\"C\") along the\nordinate is inferred from its near-IR colors. As mentioned in Section 3.1, HD 49197\"C\" is a likely F\u2013G star\n(2.0 \u2264 MK \u2264 4.0; Cox 2000), i.e., it is intrinsically too\nbright to be associated with HD 49197 (F5 V) given its\nfaint apparent magnitude.\nA robust statistical analysis of the likelihood of chance\nalignment in the four systems discussed here is not yet\npossible at this stage of the survey. They are only a fraction of the ones discovered to have candidate companions. With follow-up observations still in progress, the\nexact number of bound systems is unknown. We defer\na discussion of the companion chance alignment probability based on the full ensemble statistics until a later\npaper. Here we consider these probabilities only on a per\nsystem basis. To give an approximate idea of the limited statistics from which these preliminary results are\nextracted, we point out that to date we have analyzed\nmulti-epoch astrometric data for approximately 15 stars\n(mostly from the deep survey) with faint (\u2206KS > 3, i.e.,\nexpected to be of spectral type M or later) companions\nwithin 4\u2032\u2032 .\nWe base our calculation of the probability of false association in each system on the empirically determined\n\nspatial density of cool objects (M\u2013T spectral types) in\nthe solar neighborhood. There are 112 such known objects in the northern (\u03b4 > \u221220\u25e6) 8 pc sample (Reid et al.\n2003). The northern 8 pc sample covers 65% of the sky,\nand is estimated to be \u223c15% incomplete. The total number of cool objects and white dwarfs within 8 pc of the\nSun is therefore expected to be 198, with a volume density of 0.10 pc\u22123 . This estimate is based on a small\nfraction of the thin disk population (scale height 325 pc;\nBahcall & Soneira 1980) of the Galaxy and hence should\nnot vary substantially as a function of galactic latitude.\nWe then calculate the number of cool dwarfs expected\nto be seen in projection toward each system within a conical volume of radius 4\u2032\u2032 centered on the star, with the observer at the apex of the cone. We truncate the radial extent of the conical volume by requiring that the apparent\nK magnitude of a projected companion falls within the\nlimits allowed by the spectral type (and hence, absolute\nmagnitude) of the detected one. Absolute K magnitudes\nfor the M2\u20134 dwarfs discussed here have been adopted\nfrom Bessell (1991). Although Bessell's M dwarf classification system pre-dates the discovery of ultra-cool dwarfs\n(later than M5), it remains valid for early M dwarfs. For\nL4\u00b11 spectral types we adopt absolute K magnitudes\nfrom Dahn et al. (2002).\nThe expected number \u03bc of unrelated cool dwarfs within\nthe relevant volume around each star is listed in the last\ncolumn of Table 6. Given that for all stars \u03bc \u226a 1, we\ncan assume that the event of seeing an unrelated field\nobject in the vicinity of one of our program stars is governed by Poisson statistics. Hence, the probability of\nfinding one or more such dwarfs near any given star (i.e.,\nthe probability of chance alignment) is 1 \u2212 e\u03bc \u2248 \u03bc. As\nseen from Table 6, after having followed up the companions spectroscopically, we can claim with \u226599.99% certainty in each case that the companion is physically associated with its respective primary. As discussed above,\nsuch probabilities need to be regarded in the context of\nthe ensemble statistics. Within our sample of 4 spectroscopically confirmed companions, the probability that at\nleast one is a false positive is 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 . This exemplifies\nthe power of spectroscopic follow-up as an alternative to\nmulti-epoch astrometry in constraining the likelihood of\nphysical association in a system.\n4.2. Stellar Ages and Companion Masses\nWe estimate the ages of the primaries (Table 2) from\npublished data on their chromospheric activity, Li I\nequivalent width, and kinematic association with young\nmoving groups. Masses for each of the companions\n(Table 6) were determined either from the low-mass\npre-main sequence evolutionary models of Baraffe et al.\n(1998), or from the brown-dwarf cooling models of\nChabrier et al. (2000, \"DUSTY\") and Burrows et al.\n(1997). We have not used the dust-free \"COND\" models\nof Baraffe et al. (2003), since they are more appropriate\nfor temperatures .1300 K (i.e., for T dwarfs) when all\ngrains are expected to have gravitationally settled below\nthe photosphere.\nHD 49197B. - From the strength of Ca H & K\ncore emission in Keck/HIRES spectra of the primary,\nWright et al. (2004) determine an age of 525 Myr\nfor HD 49197, which we assume accurate to within\n\n\fPalomar AO Survey of Young Stars\n\u224850%, given the variation in chromospheric activity of solar-type stars (Henry et al. 1996). No other\nage-related indicators exist in the literature for this\nF5 star. From our own high-resolution optical spectra, we measure EW(Li \u03bb6707.8) = 80 m\u00c5 (Hillenbrand et al., in prep.), consistent with a Pleiades-like\n(120 Myr; Stauffer, Schultz, & Kirkpatrick 1998) or older\nage. Hence, we adopt an age of 260\u2013790 Myr for the primary. Assuming co-evality, the mass of the secondary\nis 0.060+0.012\n\u22120.025 M\u2299 (Burrows et al. 1997; Chabrier et al.\n2000), where the range of masses accomodates the one\nsigma error in the inferred absolute magnitude of the\nsecondary, and the allowed age range for the primary.\nHD 49197B is thus a brown dwarf.\nHD 129333B. - The primary is a well-known\nyoung star, kinematically belonging to the Local\nAssociation (Pleiades moving group, 20\u2013150 Myr;\nSoderblom & Clements 1987; Montes et al. 2001b). Results from the Mount Wilson spectroscopic survey\n(Soderblom 1985) and from the Keck/Lick r.v. program\n(Wright et al. 2004) show strong Ca II H & K emission, indicating high levels of chromospheric activity\nand youth. Wright et al. list an age of <10 Myr for\nthis star, though the chromospheric activity-age relation is not reliable for stars that young, in part because of the large variance in rotation rates of stars\nyounger than 50\u201380 Myr (e.g., Soderblom et al. 1993),\nand because the relation is not calibrated at such young\nages. Montes et al. (2001a) report strong Li I absorption (EW (Li I) = 198 m\u00c5), and conclude that the star\nis \"significantly younger\" than the Pleiades (120 Myr;\nStauffer et al. 1998). Assuming an age of 10\u2013100 Myr\nfor the system, we estimate the mass of the secondary at\n0.20+0.30\n\u22120.08 M\u2299 (from models of Baraffe et al. 1998).\nV522 PerB. - The primary is a member of the \u03b1 Per\nopen cluster, confirmed by photometry, kinematics, and\nspectroscopy (Prosser 1992). From high-resolution spectroscopy and determination of the lithium depletion\nboundary in the cluster, Stauffer et al. (1999) determine an age of 90\u00b110 Myr, consistent with a recent\nage estimate from upper main-sequence turn-off fitting\n(Ventura et al. 1998). Using the Lyon group stellar evolution models (Baraffe et al. 1998), we determine a mass\nof 0.085\u20130.15 M\u2299 for the secondary. However, from their\nsub-stellar \"DUSTY\" code (Chabrier et al. 2000), the\ntreatment of dust opacity in which may be more appropriate for this cool (\u223c3200 K) star, we find that its mass\nis \u22650.10 M\u2299 . We thus estimate 0.10\u20130.15 M\u2299 for the\nmass of V522 PerB.\nRX J0329.1+0118B. - Neuh\u00e4user et al. (1995) list\nRX J0329.1+0118 (G0 IV) as a fast-rotating (v sin i =\n70 km/s) X-ray source south of Taurus, with a Li I\nequivalent width of 110 m\u00c5: all indicators of relative youth.\nAssuming a common origin and distance with the stars in the Taurus molecular cloud\n(140 pc; Kenyon, Dobrzycka, & Hartmann 1994), the\nauthors claim that its bolometric luminosity is higher\nthan that of a zero-age main-sequence star, and the\nstar is therefore likely in the pre-main sequence (PMS)\nphase. From a proper-motion survey of PMS stars in\nTaurus-Auriga however, Frink et al. (1997) find that the\nyoung stars south of Taurus discussed in Neuh\u00e4user et al.\n\n9\n\n(1995) are kinematically unrelated to those in Taurus,\nand that star formation in the two complexes must have\nbeen triggered by different events. From the Pleiades-like\nLi I equivalent width of RX J0329.1+0118, we assign an\nage of \u2248120 Myr for this star. Given the spectral type\nof the secondary, its mass is 0.20+0.30\n\u22120.10 M\u2299 (Baraffe et al.\n1998).\n4.3. HD 129333: Binary or Triple?\nThe existence of a stellar companion to HD 129333\nhas already been inferred in the r.v. work of\nDuquennoy & Mayor (1991, DM91), who find that the\nstar is a long-period single-lined spectroscopic binary\n(SB1). From their derived orbital parameters, the authors determine a secondary mass M2 \u2265 0.37M\u2299, and\nsuggest that the star be targeted with speckle interferometry to attempt to resolve the companion. We should\ntherefore consider whether the companion that we have\nresolved (and named HD 129333B) is identical to the\nspectroscopically inferred one.\n4.3.1. The Combined Radial Velocity and Astrometric\nSolution\nCombining r.v. and astrometric data presents a powerful approach to fully constrain all the orbital elements of\na binary system. In this Section we test the hypothesis\nthat the DM91 and the imaged companions are identical\nby attempting to solve for the parameters of the relative\norbit and checking for consistency with all available data.\nThe orbital parameters that can be determined\nthrough r.v. monitoring of an SB1 are the eccentricity\ne, the period P , the epoch T0 of periastron, the longitude \u03c9 of periastron, the systemic radial velocity vrad,0 ,\nand the primary velocity semi-amplituide K1 . K1 is related to the other orbital parameters through the mass\nfunction\nf (M ) =\n\n(1 \u2212 e2 )3/2 P K13\n(M2 sin i)3\n=\n,\n2\n(M1 + M2 )\n2\u03c0G\n\n(2)\n\nwhere M1,2 are the component masses, i is the inclination of the orbit with respect to the observer, and \u03c0 and\nG are constants (e.g., Heintz 1978, p.80). The orbital\ninclination i cannot be constrained from r.v. monitoring;\nhence the masses and the semi-major axes a1,2 of the\nbinary components are degenerate with i.\nFrom astrometric observations we can fit for e, P , T0 ,\n\u03c9, i, a1,2 (and hence, M1,2 ), and for the only remaining parameter - the longitude of the ascending node\n\u03a9. Therefore, by performing a least-squares fit to the\ncombined and appropriately-weighted r.v. and astrometric data, one can fully determine the orbit of a binary\nand attain greater precision in estimating the orbital elements (Morbey 1975).\nWe first list the orbital parameters that have been\nalready determined. Based on the r.v. measurements\nshown in Figure 10, DM91 find e = 0.665 \u00b1 0.023,\nT0 = JD 2446932\u00b120 = year 1987.37, \u03c9 = 188.0 \u00b1 5.2\u25e6 ,\nK1 = 5.09 \u00b1 0.20 km s\u22121 , and P = 4575 days =\n12.53 years. DM91 state however, that the period is\nprobably accurate only \"to the nearest unit of log P \"\n(i.e., 103.5 < P < 104.5 days, or between 8.7 and 87\nyears), and calculate the uncertainties in e, T0 , \u03c9, and\nK1 for a fixed P . Nevertheless, because of the high ec-\n\n\f10\n\nMetchev & Hillenbrand\n\ncentricity of the orbit and because of their adequate observational coverage of the star near r.v. minimum, the\nfinal values of these three parameters are not expected\nto be significantly different. Assuming that the r.v. and\nthe resolved companions are the same, we impose the\nadditional constraints derived from our astrometric observations, namely, the separation \u03c1 and position angle\n\u03c6 between the binary components on 2003 May 13 (T =\nJD 2452772 = year 2003.36). Given the long (multi-year)\norbital period and the small change (insignificant within\nthe error bars) between our two relative astrometric observations taken four months apart, we only use one of\nthe astrometric measurements. Finally, we adopt a mass\nof 1.05 M\u2299 for the G0 V primary, based on an estimate\nfrom Dorren & Guinan (1994).\nThe equation that determines the binary orbit is Kepler's equation:\n2\u03c0\n(T \u2212 T0 ),\n(3)\nP\nwhere the eccentric anomaly E is related to the true\nanomaly \u03b8 through\n\u00131/2\n\u0012\n\u03b8\nE\n1+e\ntan =\ntan .\n(4)\n2\n1\u2212e\n2\nE \u2212 e sin E =\n\nThe remaining equations are:\ns\n\na3\nG(M1 + M2 )\n\n(5)\n\nr = a(1 \u2212 e cos E)\n\n(6)\n\nP = 2\u03c0\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03c1 = r (1 \u2212 sin (\u03b8 + \u03c9) sin i)\ntan \u03c6 \u2212 tan(\u03b8 + \u03c9) cos i\ntan \u03a9 =\n.\n1 + tan \u03c6 tan(\u03b8 + \u03c9) cos i\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nBecause the orbital period of HD 129333 is poorly constrained by DM91, we choose to treat P as a free parameter. Thus, the unknown parameters are eight: P , M2 ,\ni, a (the semi-major axis of the relative orbit), \u03a9, E, the\nradius vector r(T \u2212 T0 ), and the true anomaly \u03b8(T \u2212 T0 )\nof the companion in the relative orbit at time T \u2212 T0 .\nFrom the combined imaging and r.v. data we have imposed seven constraints: \u03c1(T \u2212 T0 ), \u03c6(T \u2212 T0 ), e, \u03c9, M1 ,\nK1 , and T \u2212 T0 . Given that the number of unknowns is\ngreater than the number of constraints, we cannot solve\nunambiguously for the parameters, let alone use a leastsquares approach to determine their best-fitting values.\nHowever, by stepping through a grid of constant values\nfor one of the parameters, we can determine the rest.\nWe choose M2 as our step parameter for the grid, treating it as a known parameter. In principle we can use\nEquations 4\u20137 to express P in terms of M2 , E, and the\nknown variables, and then substitute this expression in\nEquation 3, which can be solved for E. However, because of the complexity of the general functional form\nP (M2 , E, \u03c1, \u03c6, e, \u03c9, M1 , K1 , T \u2212T0 ), and because Kepler's\nequation cannot be solved analytically, we employ a twostage iterative approach. In the outer iteration, for a\ngiven value of M2 we converge upon a solution for P ,\nand in the inner iteration we use the Newton-Raphson\nmethod to solve Kepler's equation for E. The iterative\nNewton-Raphson method has been described in detail\nelsewhere (e.g., Press et al. 1992), so we do not discuss\n\nit further. The convergence of the outer iteration loop\nhowever merits a brief description.\nWe take an initial estimate P0 for the period and invert Equation 2 to obtain a numerical value for sin i as\na function of P and M2 . From Equations 4\u20137 we then\nexpress P in terms of the known parameters plus M2 , E,\nand sin i, and plug that expression in Equation 3, which\nis then easier to solve for E. Once E is obtained, we\ninvert Kepler's equation to find a solution P = P1 for\nthe orbital period that depends on the initial guess P0 .\nWe repeat the above procedure by substituting P1 for\nP0 , and so forth until the values Pj converge. We stop\nwhen the value of P is constrained to better than 0.1%,\nwhich usually occurs after 3\u20134 iterations. Because of the\nmonotonic dependence of the orbital elements i, a, and E\non P , we can be certain that the thus-obtained solution\nfor P is unique.\nFollowing the above procedure and adopting the DM91\nvalues for e, T0 , and K1 , we find that if the resolved\ncompanion is identical to the r.v. one, its mass is at least\n0.68M\u2299, with a corresponding period of 50.0 years, a =\n16.3 AU, and i = 85\u25e6 . Values as small as M2 = 0.58M\u2299\n(P = 42.8 years, a = 14.4 AU, i = 84\u25e6 ) are possible if\nall parameters are set at their one-sigma deviations that\nminimize M2 .\nHowever, a minimum mass of \u2248 0.58M\u2299 for\nHD 129333B does not agree with the constraint from\nour IR spectroscopy, M2 \u2264 0.50M\u2299 (Sections 3.3, 4.2),\nobtained from comparison to theoretical evolutionary\ntracks from Baraffe et al. (1998). Moreover, a companion with mass M2 \u2265 0.58M\u2299 (spectral type K8 or earlier; Cox 2000) would be too bright in absolute magnitude (MK \u2264 5.1; Bessell 1991) to be identified with\nHD 129333B (MKS = 6.30\u00b10.12, from its apparent magnitude and from the Hipparcos distance to HD 129333).\nIt is therefore likely that the r.v. and the spectroscopic\ncompanion are not identical.\nThe inconsistency between the masses could be explained by noting that a recent study of low-mass binaries by Hillenbrand & White (2004) has shown that\nmost modern stellar evolutionary models tend to underestimate dynamical masses of main and pre-main sequence stars. According to the authors, the Baraffe et al.\n(1998) models underestimate the mass of a 0.5M\u2299 main\nsequence star by \u224820%. This could reconcile the limits on the mass of HD 129333B obtained from near IR\nspectroscopy with those from the orbital solution. However, the problem of the companion being sub-luminous\nremains.\n4.3.2. Comparison to Other Radial Velocity Data\nThe DM91 set of r.v. data are the most accurate\nand deterministic for the orbit of HD 129333. Other\ndata exist from Wilson & Joy (1950), Dorren & Guinan\n(1994), Montes et al. (2001a), and from our own highresolution spectroscopic observations3 (Figure 10); however, they do not improve the orbital phase coverage\ngreatly. Although Dorren & Guinan (data plotted as\nopen squares) appear to have captured the binary near\nan r.v. maximum around 1993, their data are less restric3 v\n\u22121 and \u221221.77 \u00b1 0.62 km s\u22121 on\nrad = \u221219.79 \u00b1 0.37 km s\n2002 April 18, and 2003 February 10, respectively (Hillenbrand et\nal., in prep.).\n\n\fPalomar AO Survey of Young Stars\ntive because of their large uncertainties. In addition, the\nDorren & Guinan data for 1990 systematically overestimate the r.v. of the primary with respect to DM91 data\ntaken over the same period. We therefore choose to disregard the Dorren & Guinan data set. The remaining\ndata are very limited and we do not attempt to use them\nto re-fit the DM91 orbital solution. However, they are of\nsome utility in constraining the orbital period.\nBecause no other r.v. minimum is observed for\nHD 129333 between 1987.37 and 2003.36, we conclude\nthat P > 16 years. The Wilson & Joy data point (based\non three measurements) is consistent with an r.v. minimum, and is thus critical in constraining the orbital\nperiod. However, the authors do not list an epoch for\nthe observations. The Wilson & Joy data were taken in\nthe course of the Mt. Wilson stellar spectroscopic survey, and are kept in the Ahmanson Foundation Star\nPlates Archive4 . After consultation with the original\nplates, we retrieve the dates of the individual observations: 1936 March 10 (year 1936.19), 1936 Jun 4\n(year 1936.42), and 1942 Jun 24 (year 1942.48). We\nadopt the mean date of these observations, the year\n1938.4+4.1\n\u22122.2, as the epoch for the Wilson & Joy measurement vrad = \u221231.0 \u00b1 1.3 km s\u22121 , where the errors in the\nepoch correspond to the interval between their first and\nlast observation. Because of its highly eccentric orbit,\nthe star must have been within 1 year of r.v. minimum\nat this epoch. Given the r.v. minimum in 1987.37 and\nP > 16 years, we infer that the r.v. companion has a\nlikely orbital period equal to the interval between the\ntwo observed minima, or to some integer fraction thereof:\n+1.2\n+0.8\n49.0+2.4\n\u22124.2 years, 24.5\u22122.1 years, or 16.3\u22121.4 years (all consistent with the DM91 estimate).\nThe 49-year orbital period agrees with the one obtained in Section 4.3.1, and supports the evidence that\nthe r.v. and the resolved companion may be identical. If the r.v. companion was on a 24.5-year period\n(a = 9.8 AU, from the DM91 orbital elements), it would\nhave been & 0.33 \u2212 0.44\u2032\u2032 from the primary during our\nimaging in 2003, with mass M2 \u2265 0.47M\u2299. Such a\ncompanion should have been at least as bright as the\nresolved one (\u2206KS = 3.0), although could have fallen\njust below our detection limits (\u2206KS \u2248 3.0 at 0.4\u2032\u2032 )\nif it was at the lower limit of the allowed mass range.\nGiven q = M2 /M1 \u2265 0.46 in this case, the star should\nbe easily detectable as a double-lined spectroscopic binary (SB2) through high-resolution spectroscopy in the\nnear IR, where the contrast favors detecting SB2 systems\nwith mass ratios as small as 0.2 (Prato et al. 2002). A\n16.3-year period can most probably be excluded, since\nthe 2003 data point does not indicate an approaching\nr.v. minimum (Figure 10) in late-2003\u20132004, as would be\nexpected at this periodicity.\nTherefore, even after consideration of additional\narchival r.v. data, the question about the multiplicity\nof HD 129333 remains open. The system can be either\na binary with a 14\u201316 AU semi-major axis (but a discrepancy in the inferred mass of the secondary), or a\ntriple with a 10 AU inner (spectroscopic) and \u223c25 AU\nouter (resolved) components. Indeed, SIMBAD does list\nHD 129333 as a BY Dra variable, which may indicate\n4\n\nMaintained at the Carnegie Observatories of Washington,\nPasadena, California.\n\n11\n\nthat the high level of chromospheric activity arises from\nclose binarity, rather than extreme youth. However, the\nhigh photospheric Li I abundance of HD 129333 and its\nkinematic association with the Pleiades moving group\n(Section 4.2) confirm its young age. Moreover, at 10 AU\nsemi-major axis the inferred spectroscopic companion is\ntoo distant to be synchronized with the rotation period\nof the primary (2.7 days; Dorren & Guinan 1994), and\nto thus affect its chromospheric activity. An additional\nclose-in component would be required, that should produce a short-period SB1 or SB2 spectroscopic signature,\nas in binary BY Dra systems. Such is not reported by\nDM91, however.\nIn deciding whether a triple system with a 24.5-year\nperiod for the r.v. (inner) companion is a likely state for\nHD 129333, it is worth considering the dynamical stability of such a system. We adopt masses of 1.05 M\u2299 ,\n0.5 M\u2299 and 0.2 M\u2299 for the primary, the inner, and the\nouter (resolved) companion, respectively, and apply a dynamical stability criterion from the numerical analysis\nof Donnison & Mikulskis (1995). Assuming prograde orbits, the Donnison & Mikulskis condition for stability as\napplied to HD 129333 states that the distance of closest\napproach of the outer companion to the barycenter of the\nsystem should be >27 AU. Variations in the masses of\nthe two companions within the determined limits do not\nchange this requirement by more than 3\u20135 AU. At a projected separation of 25.0 \u00b1 1.5 AU from the primary, the\nresolved companion is fully consistent with this requirement. Hence, the system can be a dynamically stable\ntriple.\n4.4. HD 49197B: a Rare Young L Dwarf\nOur empirical knowledge of the photospheres of young\n(<1 Gyr) L dwarfs is currently very limited. The only\nconfirmed such dwarfs are all companions to main sequence stars: G 196\u20133B (L2, 20\u2013300 Myr; Rebolo et al.\n1998), Gl 417B5 (L4.5, 80\u2013300 Myr; Kirkpatrick et al.\n2001), the pair HD 130948B/C (L2, 300\u2013600 Myr;\nPotter et al. 2002), and now HD 49197B (L4, 260\u2013\n790 Myr). It is useful to expand the sample of young\nL dwarfs in order to study gravity-sensitive features in\ntheir spectra, and to provide constraints for evolutionary\nmodels of ultra-cool dwarfs.\nYounger L dwarfs have been reported in several\nopen clusters: \u03c3 Ori (1\u20138 Myr; Zapatero Osorio et al.\n1999), the Trapezium (\u223c1 Myr; Lucas et al. 2001), and\nChameleon I (1\u20133 Myr; L\u00f3pez Mart\u0131\u0301 et al. 2004). However, these results have not been independently confirmed. The youth of \u03c3 Ori 47 (L1.5), and hence its\nassociation with the cluster, has been recently brought\ninto question by McGovern et al. (2004), who find that\nthe object shows strong K I absorption at J band, characteristic of several Gyr old field dwarfs. Lucas et al.\n(2001) determine M1\u2013L8 spectral types for their objects\nin the Trapezium, using water indices defined for the\nR \u2248 30 H-band spectra. They also use Burrows et al.\n(1997) sub-stellar evolutionary tracks to infer masses\nfrom IJH photometry. However, the deduced spectral\ntypes and the masses correlate very poorly - a result po5 Gl 417B is itself considered to be resolved by Bouy et al. (2003)\ninto two components with a 70 mas separation, equal to the diffraction limit of their HST/WFPC2 observations.\n\n\f12\n\nMetchev & Hillenbrand\n\ntentially traceable to the anomalous continuum shapes of\ntheir spectra (their Figure 4), some of which appear to\ncontain residual telluric or instrument-transmission features (as seen in their Figure 1) that the authors interpret as photospheric water absorption. Finally, in their\nanalysis of photometrically-identified brown dwarfs toward Chameleon I, L\u00f3pez Mart\u0131\u0301 et al. (2004) acknowledge that the classification of their early L dwarfs is\nuncertain, because their locus overlaps with that of extincted M-type objects on their color-magnitude diagram\n(Figure 8 in that paper).\nTherefore, because of its association with a young star,\nHD 49197B is one of only five known young L dwarfs\nwhose age can be determined with reasonable certainty.\nAll five span a narrow range in spectral type: L2\u2013L5. A\nprogram of uniform spectroscopic observations of these\nyoung L dwarf companions, undertaken in a manner similar to the NIRSPEC brown dwarf spectroscopic survey\nof McLean et al. (2003), promises to establish gravitysensitive standards (as in Kleinmann & Hall 1986, for\nF8\u2013M7 stars) to use in determining the ages of isolated\nL dwarfs.\n4.5. Sub-Stellar Companions to Main-Sequence Stars\nUntil recently, only a handful of brown dwarf companions to nearby A\u2013M stars were known from direct imaging, all at angular separations >4\u2032\u2032 (see compilation in Reid et al. 2001). With AO technology\nstill in its early developing stages, ground-based direct\nimaging observations of main-sequence stars were sensitive mostly to massive, widely-separated sub-stellar\ncompanions.\nFrom the observed dearth of brown\ndwarf companions to main sequence stars at separations comparable to those in main sequence binaries, it was inferred that the radial-velocity \"brown\ndwarf desert\" (for separations .3 AU; Campbell et al.\n1988; Marcy & Benitz 1989; Marcy & Butler 2000) extended to at least 120 AU (Oppenheimer et al. 2001),\nor 1200 AU (McCarthy 2001; McCarthy & Zuckerman\n2004), with estimates for the brown dwarf companion\nfrequency around 1% within this separation range. From\n2MASS data however, Gizis et al. (2001) found that\nthe brown dwarf companion fraction was much higher\n(\u223c18%) at separations >1000 AU from F\u2013M0 dwarfs,\nand consistent with that of stellar companions to G stars\n(Duquennoy & Mayor 1991). Though the Gizis et al. result is based on only 3 bound companions out of 57 then\nknown field L and T dwarfs (a fourth bound companion,\nGJ 1048B, has now been confirmed in the same sample\nby Seifahrt, Neuh\u00e4user, & Mugrauer 2004), they exclude\na brown dwarf companion fraction of 1.5% at the 99.5%\nconfidence level. Such an abrupt change in the frequency\nof bound brown dwarfs at 1000 AU from main-sequence\nstars is not predicted by any of the current brown dwarf\nformation scenarios. More likely would be a continuously varying sub-stellar companion fraction from inside\nthe r.v. brown dwarf desert at <3 AU out to distances\n>1000 AU.\nRecent results from more sensitive space- and groundbased surveys point to a somewhat higher frequency\nof sub-stellar companions. In a survey of 45 young\nstars within \u223c50 pc, the NICMOS Environments of\nNearby Stars team has reported the discovery of 2\nconfirmed brown dwarfs, TWA 5B (Webb et al. 1999;\n\nLowrance et al. 1999) and HR 7329B (Lowrance et al.\n2000), and a probable third one: the binary companion Gl 577B/C, whose components likely span the\nstellar/substellar boundary (Lowrance et al. 2003). A\nsimilar survey of twenty-four 5\u201315 Myr old stars in\nthe more distant (\u2248150 pc) Scorpius-Centaurus association does not detect any plausible sub-stellar companions (Brandner et al. 2000). Even so, the fraction of stars with sub-stellar companions detected with\nNICMOS (2\u20133 out of 69) is markedly higher than the\none reported from the two initial large-scale groundbased surveys (2 out of \u2248390; Oppenheimer et al.\n2001; McCarthy & Zuckerman 2004), and is inconsistent with the incompleteness-corrected estimate (\u22642%)\nof McCarthy & Zuckerman (2004). Furthermore, as a\nresult of improvements in existing AO technology, and\nthe equipping of several large telescopes with newlydesigned high-order AO systems, recent ground-based\ndirect imaging efforts have been more successful in detecting close-in brown dwarf companions to sun-like\nprimaries: Gl 86B (Els et al. 2001), HD 130948B/C\n(Potter et al. 2002), HR 7672B (Liu et al. 2002), and\nHD 49197B (this paper). All of these are at angular separations <3\u2032\u2032 , and at projected distances <50 AU from\ntheir primaries, and hence inaccessible for imaging by\nMcCarthy & Zuckerman (2004), whose survey targeted\nthe 75\u20131200 AU separation range. Finally, with the natural guide star limit of AO systems being pushed to\never fainter magnitudes using curvature sensors (down\nto \u223c16 mag at 0.8\u03bcm; Siegler et al. 2003), a number of\nvery low-mass (VLM) binaries has become known, with\nseparations as small as 1 AU. The components in these\nVLM binaries often straddle the stellar-substellar boundary (for a compilation, see Table 4 in Close et al. 2003).\nThe emergent picture from these recent discoveries\nis that of potential deficiency of brown dwarfs at 10\u2013\n1000 AU separations from main sequence stars, though\nnot as pronounced as in the r.v. brown dwarf desert\n(frequency <0.5%; Marcy & Butler 2000). Based on\none detection (of a binary brown dwarf companion)\namong 31 stars, Potter et al. (2002) set a lower limit\nof 3.2\u00b13.2% for the frequency of brown dwarfs at 10\u2013\n100 AU from main sequence stars. At separations\n>50 AU, from the NICMOS discoveries (Lowrance et al.\n1999, 2000) and from their newly-reported brown dwarf\ncompanion to the star GSC 08047\u201300232 in Horologium,\nNeuh\u00e4user & Guenther (2004) report that brown dwarfs\nare found around 6\u00b14% of stars. The outer scale for the\nNeuh\u00e4user & Guenther (2004) estimate is not specified,\nbut is probably limited to 1000\u20132000 AU by the FOV\nof high angular resolution IR detectors (up to 40\u2032\u2032 \u00d740\u2032\u2032 ;\ne.g., NICMOS, or ones used behind AO), and by the distances out to which young stars are probed for sub-stellar\ncompanions (out to 100\u2013200 pc). By combining these estimates with the Gizis et al. (2001) estimate of 18\u00b114%\nat separations >1000 AU, we can conclude that, despite\nthe small number statistics involved, there possibly exists\na continuum in the frequency distribution of brown dwarf\ncompanions at separations ranging from within the r.v.\nbrown dwarf desert (\u22643 AU) out to >1000 AU (where\nbrown dwarf companions are as common as stellar ones).\nThe observed decline in the rate of occurrence of directly\nimaged brown dwarf companions at small separations is\nlikely at least partially an effect of the limited sensitivity\n\n\fPalomar AO Survey of Young Stars\nof imaging surveys to close-in low-mass brown dwarfs.\nNew, sensitive surveys for sub-stellar companions, such\nas the Palomar AO Survey of Young Stars are poised to\nexplore this regime in the next few years.\n5. CONCLUSION\n\nWe have presented the observing strategy and first\nresults from the Palomar Adaptive Optics Survey of\nYoung Stars, aimed at detecting sub-stellar companions\nto <400 Myr solar analogs within 160 pc of the Sun. We\nhave discovered low-mass (0.04\u20130.5 M\u2299 ) companions to 4\nyoung nearby stars. The L4\u00b11 brown dwarf HD 49197B\nand the M2\u00b11 V star HD 129333B have been confirmed\nas companions to their corresponding primaries through\nfollow-up astrometry and spectroscopy. Physical association in the V522 Per and RX J0329.1+0118 systems,\ncontaining respectively M4\u00b11 and M3\u00b12 secondaries,\nhas been established with >99.95% confidence from spectroscopy and from the expected space density of objects\nof similar spectral type.\nThe astrometry for the resolved stellar companion to\nHD 129333 is found to be consistent with archival r.v.\ndata for this single-lined spectroscopic binary, indicating that the resolved and the r.v. companions may be\nidentical. Given the inferred mass constraints on the\nsecondary however, the companion is then underluminous by at least 1 mag at KS . A solution in which\nthe star is a triple is also likely. It does not suffer from\nsimilar inconsistencies, and could be dynamically stable.\nBecause the expected mass ratio between the inner two\ncompanions of the triple is \u22650.46, they should be resolved\nas a double-lined spectroscopic binary from high resolution infrared spectroscopy. In either case HD 129333 is\nconfirmed to be a multiple star, and hence not a true\nanalog of the young sun, as previously considered (e.g.,\nDorren & Guinan 1994; Strassmeier & Rice 1998).\nThe newly-discovered brown dwarf HD 49197B is one\nof very few confirmed young (<1 Gyr) L dwarfs. It is also\na member of a small number of brown dwarf companions\nimaged at projected separations of <50 AU from their\nhost stars, i.e., at distances comparable to the giantplanet zone in the Solar System. The number of such\n\n13\n\ncompanions, albeit small, has been growing steadily in\nrecent years with the results of more sensitive imaging\nsurveys coming on-line. Longer duration radial velocity\nsurveys and improvements in AO techniques are expected\nto further push the detection limits of each method to the\npoint where their sensitivities overlap. Although the true\nextent and depth of the so-called \"brown dwarf desert\"\nwill not be revealed until that time, increased sensitivity\nto sub-stellar companions at small separation has already\nresulted in upward revisions of their estimated frequency.\nWe would like to thank Richard Dekany and Mitchell\nTroy for sharing with us their expertise of the Palomar\nAO system, Rick Burress and Jeff Hickey for assistance\nwith PHARO, Randy Campbell, Paola Amico and David\nLe Mignant for their guidance in using Keck AO, Keith\nMatthews and Dave Thompson for help with NIRC2,\nand our telescope operators Jean Mueller at the Palomar\n5 m telescope, and Chuck Sorenson at the Keck II telescope.

Panel (a) shows both candidate companions to\nHD 49197; panels (b) and (c) are zoomed in to point out only the close-in bona-fide companion (HD 49197B). The first-epoch image is the\nresult of 24 median-combined 60 sec exposures with Palomar/PHARO, whereas the second-epoch image was formed by median-combining\nsix 60 sec exposures with Keck/NIRC2. A 1.0\u2032\u2032 -diameter coronagraph occults the primary in both cases; in the Keck image the coronagraph\nshows a residual \u22480.16% transmission. HD 49197B was initially unnoticed in the first-epoch image, where its detection was hindered by\nthe presence of equally prominent AO speckles.\n\nFig. 2.- Palomar images of the stellar companions. The HD 129333 image is taken through a narrow-band (1%) Br\u03b3 (2.166 \u03bcm) filter,\nwhile the V522 Per and RX J0329.1+0118 images are taken at KS . Five dithered 1.4 sec exposures were aligned and median-combined to\nobtain each of the displayed images.\n\n\fPalomar AO Survey of Young Stars\n\n19\n\nFig. 3.- K-band spectra of the low-mass companions from Palomar (HD 129333B; R \u2248 1000), and Keck (RX J0329.1+0118B, V522 PerB,\nand HD 49197B; R \u2248 2700). All spectra have been normalized to unity at 2.20\u03bcm and offset by 0.5 in the vertical axis.\n\n\f20\n\nMetchev & Hillenbrand\n\nFig. 4.- J-band spectra of two of the low-mass companions from Palomar (HD 129333B; R \u2248 1200), and Keck (V522 PerB; R \u2248 2400\nin the fifth order, and R \u2248 2900 in the sixth). All spectra have been normalized to unity at 1.25\u03bcm and offset by 0.5 in the vertical axis.\n\n\fPalomar AO Survey of Young Stars\n\n21\n\nFig. 5.- Near-IR color-color diagram of the detected companions. The solid line represents the B2V\u2013L8V main sequence, with data\ncompiled from Cox (2000, B2V\u2013M6V) and Kirkpatrick et al. (2000, M8V\u2013L8V). The dashed line shows the G0\u2013M7 giant branch (Cox\n2000). The Cox and the Kirkpatrick et al. colors are converted from the Johnson-Glass (Bessell & Brett 1988) and 2MASS (Cutri et al.\n2003) systems, respectively, to the CIT system using relations from Carpenter (2001). HD 49197\"C\" is too blue to be a bona-fide low-mass\ncompanion to HD 49197. The near IR colors of the remainder of the companions agree well with their inferred spectral types (Table 6).\n\n\f22\n\nMetchev & Hillenbrand\n\nFig. 6.- Proper motion diagram for the two companions to HD 49197. The offsets from the primary at each observational epoch are\nplotted as solid points with errorbars. The inferred offsets at the first epoch (assuming non-common proper motion) are shown just with\nerrorbars. The dashed lines reflect the proper and parallactic motions of the primary between the two epochs. HD 49197B is a common\nproper motion companion within the 1 sigma errors, while HD 49197\"C\" is more consistent with being a background object.\n\n\fPalomar AO Survey of Young Stars\n\n23\n\nFig. 7.- Same as Figure 6 for the companion to HD 129333. Within the 1 sigma errors, the companion shares the proper motion of the\nprimary.\n\n\f24\n\nMetchev & Hillenbrand\n\nFig. 8.- Same as Figure 6 for the companions to V522 Per (left) and RX J0329.1+0118 (right). The Nov 21, 1995 data point for the\ncompanion to RX J0329.1+0118 is from Sterzik et al. (1997) and is set to be at the mean epoch of their observations (Nov 19\u201323, 1995).\nThe proper motion of the primaries between the observations epochs are too small to decide the physical association of the companions\nwithin the astrometric errors. The probability of association in each system is estimated from near IR spectroscopy (Section 4.1).\n\n\fPalomar AO Survey of Young Stars\n\n25\n\nFig. 9.- Comparison of the photometrically derived absolute KS -band magnitudes of the companions (assuming the heliocentric\ndistances of the corresponding primaries) to the spectroscopically inferred ones. The dashed line has a slope of unity. The location of\nHD 49197\"C\" (of which no spectra were taken) along the vertical axis is based on a spectral type (F\u2013G) inferred from its near IR colors\n(Section 3.1). HD 49197\"C\" is intrinsically too bright to be at the same heliocentric distance as HD 49197, whereas the remainder of the\ncompanions are consistent with being at the distances of their respective primaries.\n\n\f26\n\nMetchev & Hillenbrand\n\nFig. 10.- Radial velocity data for HD 129333 from the literature. Data from DM91 are plotted as filled circles, from Dorren & Guinan\n(1994) as open squares, from Montes et al. (2001a) as filled squares, and from Wilson & Joy (1950) as an open circle. Our own unpublished\nr.v. data are shown as solid triangles. The exact epoch of the Wilson & Joy observation is unknown. Given the DM91 orbital solution and\nthe current phase coverage, periods <16 years can be excluded.\n\n\f"}
