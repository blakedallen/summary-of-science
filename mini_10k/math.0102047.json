This originated in work of\nChasles [9] on conics and was systematized and used to great effect by Schubert in his\ntreatise \"Kalk\u00fcl der abz\u00e4hlenden Geometrie\" [33]. The justification of Schubert's enumerative calculus and the verification of the numbers he obtained was the 15th problem\nof Hilbert.\nJustifying Schubert's enumerative calculus was a major theme of 20th century algebraic geometry and Intersection Theory provides a satisfactory modern framework.\nEnumerative Geometry deals with the second part of Hilbert's problem. Fulton's\nbook [19] is a complete reference for Intersection Theory; for historical surveys and a\ndiscussion of Enumerative Geometry, see the surveys [24, 25].\nThe Schubert calculus also refers to mathematics arising from the following class of\nenumerative geometric problems: Determine the number of linear subspaces of projective\nspace that satisfy incidence conditions imposed by other linear subspaces. For a survey,\nsee [26]. For example, how many lines in projective 3-space meet 4 given lines? These\nproblems are solved by studying both the geometry and the cohomology or Chow rings\nof Grassmann varieties. This field of Schubert calculus enjoys important connections not\nonly to algebraic geometry and algebraic topology, but also to algebraic combinatorics,\nrepresentation theory, differential geometry, linear algebraic groups, and symbolic computation, and has found applications in numerical homotopy continuation [22], linear\nalgebra [20] and systems theory [8].\nThe Grassmannian Gm,n of m-dimensional subspaces (m-planes) in Pn over a field k\nhas distinguished Schubert varieties\n\u03a9a0 ,a1 ,... ,am V\u2022 := {W \u2208 Gm,n | W \u2229 Vaj \u2265 j} ,\nwhere V\u2022 : V0 \u2282 V1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Vn = Pn is a flag of linear subspaces with dim Vj = j. The\nSchubert cycle \u03c3a0 ,a1 ,... ,an is the cohomology class Poincar\u00e9 dual to the fundamental homology cycle of\u03a9a0 ,a1 ,... ,am V\u2022 . The Basis Theorem asserts that the Schubert cycles form\na basis of the Chow ring A\u2217 Gm,n (when k is the complex numbers, the integral cohomolm+1\nogy groups H \u2217 Gm,n ) of the Grassmannian with \u03c3a0 ,a1 ,... ,am \u2208 A(m+1)(n+1)\u2212( n+1 )\u2212a0 \u2212***\u2212am Gm,n .\nThe Duality Theorem asserts that the basis of Schubert cycles is self-dual under the\nintersection pairing\nZ\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03b1*\u03b2.\n(\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2208 H Gm,n \u2297 H Gm,n 7\u2212\u2192 deg(\u03b1 * \u03b2) =\nGm,n\n\nwith \u03c3a0 ,a1 ,... ,am dual to \u03c3n\u2212am ,... ,n\u2212a1 ,n\u2212a0 .\nLet \u03c4b := \u03c3n\u2212m\u2212b,n\u2212m+1,... ,n , a special Schubert cycle. Then\nX\n\u03c3c0 ,c1,... ,cm ,\n\u03c3a0 ,a1 ,... ,am * \u03c4b =\n\nthe sum\nP over all (c0 , c1 , . . . , cm ) with 0 \u2264 c0 \u2264 a0 \u2264 c1 \u2264 a1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 cm \u2264 am and\nb = i (ai \u2212 ci ). This Pieri Formula determines the ring structure of cohomology; an\nalgebraic consequence is the Giambelli formula for expressing an arbitrary Schubert\n1\n\n\f2\n\ncycle in terms of special Schubert cycles. Define \u03c4b = 0 if b < 0 or b > m, and \u03c40 = 1.\nThen Giambelli's formula is\n\u03c3a0 ,a1 ,... ,am = det[\u03c4n\u2212m+j\u2212ai ]i,j=0,... ,m .\nThese four results enable computation in the Chow ring of the Grassmannian, and\nthe solution of many problems in enumerative geometry. For instance, the number of\nm-planes meeting (m+1)(n\u2212m) general (n\u2212m\u22121)-planes non-trivially is the coefficient\nof \u03c30,1,... ,m in the product (\u03c41 )(m+1)(n\u2212m) , is [34]\n1! 2! * * * (n\u2212m\u22121)! * [(m + 1)(n \u2212 m)]!\n.\n(n\u2212m)! (n\u2212m+1)! * * * (n! \u2212 1)!\nThese four results hold more generally for cohomology rings of flag manifolds G/P ;\nSchubert cycles form a self-dual basis, the Chevalley formula [10] determines the ring\nstructure (when P is a Borel subgroup), and the formulas of Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand [3]\nand Demazure [12] give the analog of the Giambelli formula. More explicit Giambelli\nformulas are provided by Schubert polynomials.\nOne cornerstone of the Schubert calculus for the Grassmannian is the Littlewood\nRichardson rule [30] for expressing a product of Schubert cycles in terms of the basis\nof Schubert cycles. [This rule is usually expressed in terms of an alternative indexing of\nSchubert cycles using partitions. A sequence (a0 , a1 , . . . , am ) corresponds to the partition\n(n \u2212 m \u2212 a0 , n \u2212 m + 1 \u2212 a1 , . . . , n \u2212 am ).] The analog of the Littlewood Richardson rule\nis not known for most other flag varieties G/P .\nMSC2000: 14N15, 14M15, 14C15, 20G20, 57T15\nSchubert Cell \u2013 The orbit of a Borel subgroup B \u2282 G on a flag variety G/P [7,\n14.12]. Here, G is a semisimple linear algebraic group over an algebraically closed field\nk and P is a parabolic subgroup of G so that G/P is a complete homogeneous variety.\nSchubert cells are indexed by the cosets of the Weyl group WP of P in the Weyl group W\nof G. Choosing B \u2282 P , these cosets are identified with T -fixed points of G/P , where T\nis a maximal torus of G and T \u2282 B. The fixed points are conjugates P \u2032 of P containing\nT . The orbit BwWP \u2243 Al(wWP ) , the affine space of dimension equal to the length of\nthe shortest element of the coset wWP . When k is the complex numbers, Schubert cells\nconstitute a CW-decomposition of G/P .\nLet k be any field and suppose G/P is the Grassmannian Gm,n of m-planes in k n .\nSchubert cells for Gm,n arise in an elementary manner. Among the m by n matrices\nwhose row space is a given H \u2208 Gm,n , there is a unique echelon matrix\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u2217 *** \u2217 1 0 *** 0 0 0 *** 0 0 0 *** 0\n\uf8ef \u2217 *** \u2217 0 \u2217 *** \u2217 1 0 *** 0 0 0 *** 0 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef . .\n\uf8fa\n\uf8f0 .. . . ... ... ... . . . ... ... ... . . . ... ... ... . . . ... \uf8fb\n\u2217 *** \u2217 0 \u2217 *** \u2217 0 \u2217 *** \u2217 1 0 *** 0\n\nThis echelon representative of H is computed from any representative by Gaussian elimination. The column numbers a1 < a2 < * * * < am of the leading entries (1s) of the rows in\nthis echelon representative determines the type of H. Counting the undetermined entries\nin such an\nechelon matrix shows that the set of H \u2208 Gm,n with this type is isomorphic\nP\nmn\u2212 (ai +i\u22121)\nto A\n. This set is a Schubert cell of Gm,n .\nMSC2000: 14M15, 14L35, 20G20\n\n\f3\n\nSchubert Cycle \u2013 The cycle class of a Schubert variety in the cohomology ring of\na complex flag manifold G/P , also called a Schubert class. Here, G is a semisimple\nlinear algebraic group and P is a parabolic subgroup. Schubert cycles form a basis\nfor the cohomology groups [35] [7, 14.12] of G/P . They arose [35] as representatives\nof Schubert conditions on linear subspaces of a vector space in Schubert's calculus for\nenumerative geometry [33]. The justification of Schubert's calculus in this context by\nEhresmann [13] realized Schubert cycles as cohomology classes Poincar\u00e9 dual to the\nfundamental homology cycles of Schubert varieties in the Grassmannian. While Schubert,\nEhresmann, and others worked primarily on the Grassmannian, the pertinent features of\nthe Grassmannian extend to general flag varieties G/P , giving Schubert cycles as above.\nMore generally, when G is a semisimple linear algebraic group over a field, there are\nSchubert cycles associated to Schubert varieties in each of the following theories for G/P :\nsingular (or deRham) cohomology, the Chow ring, K-theory, or equivariant or quantum\nversions of these theories. For each, the Schubert cycles form a basis over the base ring.\nFor the cohomology or the Chow ring, the Schubert cycles are universal characteristic\nclasses for (flagged) G-bundles. In particular, certain special Schubert cycles for the\nGrassmannian are universal Chern classes for vector bundles.\nMSC2000: 14M15, 14C15, 14C17, 20G20, 57T15\nSchubert Polynomials were introduced by Lascoux and Sch\u00fctzenberger [28] as\ndistinguished polynomial representatives of Schubert cycles in the cohomology ring of\nthe manifold F ln of complete flags in Cn . This extended work of Bernstein-GelfandGelfand [3] and Demazure [12] who gave algorithms for computing representatives of\nSchubert cycles in the coinvariant algebra, which is isomorphic to the cohomology ring\nof F ln [6]\nH \u2217 (F ln , Z) \u2243 Z[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ]/Z+ [x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ]Sn .\nHere, Z+ [x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ]Sn is the ideal generated by the non-constant polynomials that\nare symmetric in x1 , x2 , . . . , xn . Macdonald [31] gives an elegant algebraic treatment of\nSchubert polynomials, while Fulton [18] and Manivel [32] deal more with geometry.\nFor each i = 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1, let si be the transposition (i, i + 1) in the symmetric group\nSn , which acts on Z[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ]. The divided difference operator \u2202i is defined by\n\u2202i f = (f \u2212 si f )/(xi \u2212 xi+1 ) .\nThese satisfy\n(1)\n\n\u2202i2 = 0\n\u2202i \u2202j = \u2202j \u2202i\n\u2202i \u2202i+1 \u2202i = \u2202i+1 \u2202i \u2202i+1\n\nif |i \u2212 j| > 1\n\nIf fw \u2208 Z[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ] is a representative of the Schubert cycle \u03c3w , then\n\u001a\n0\nif l(si w) > l(w)\n,\n\u2202i fw =\nfsi w\nif l(si w) < l(w)\nwhere l(w) is the length of a permutation w and fsi w represents the Schubert cycle \u03c3si w .\nGiven a fixed polynomial representative of the Schubert cycle \u03c3wn (the class of a point as\nwn \u2208 Sn is the longest element), successively applying divided difference operators gives\n\n\f4\n\npolynomial representatives of all Schubert cycles, which are independent of the choices\ninvolved, by (1).\nThe choice of representative Swn = x1n\u22121 x2n\u22122 * * * xn\u22121 for \u03c3wn gives the Schubert\nare independent of n\npolynomials. Since \u2202n * * * \u22021 Swn+1 = Swn , Schubert polynomials\nS\nand give polynomials Sw \u2208 Z[x1 , x2 , . . . ] for w \u2208 S\u221e = Sn . These form a basis for\nthis polynomial ring, and every Schur polynomial is also a Schubert polynomial.\nThe transition formula gives another recursive construction of Schubert polynomials. For w \u2208 S\u221e , let r be the last descent of w (w(r) > w(r + 1) < w(r + 2) < * * * ) and\ndefine s > r by w(s) < w(r) < w(s+1). Set v = w(r, s), where (r, s) is the transposition.\nThen\nX\nSw = xr Sv +\nSv(q,r) ,\n\nthe sum over all q < r with l(v(q, r)) = l(v) + 1 = l(w). This formula gives an algorithm\nto compute Sw as the permutations that appear on the right hand side are either shorter\nthan w or precede it in reverse lexicographic order, and the minimal such permutation\nu of length m has Su = xm\n1 .\nThe transition formula shows that the Schubert polynomial Sw is a sum of monomials with nonnegative integral coefficients. There are several explicit formulas for the\ncoefficient of a monomial in a Schubert polynomial, either in terms of the weak order of\nthe symmetric group [5, 1, 16], an intersection number [23], or the Bruhat order [2]. An\nelegant conjectural formula of Kohnert [27] remains unproven. The Schubert polynomial\nSw for w \u2208 Sn is also the normal form reduction of any polynomial representative of\nthe Schubert cycle \u03c3w with respect to the degree reverse lexicographic term order on\nZ[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ] with x1 < x2 < * * * < xn .\nThe above-mentioned results of [6, 3, 12] are valid more generally for for any flag manifold G/B with G a semisimple reductive group and B a Borel subgroup. When G is\nan orthogonal or symplectic group, there are competing theories of Schubert polynomials [4, 15, 29], each with own merits. There are also double Schubert polynomials suited\nfor computations of degeneracy loci [21], quantum Schubert polynomials [14, 11], and\nuniversal Schubert polynomials [17].\nMSC2000: 05E05, 14N15, 14M15, 14C15, 13P10, 20G20, 57T15\nReferences\n[1] N.
