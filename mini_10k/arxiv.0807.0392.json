In\nevery case the fluctuation relation is verified in the large \u03c4 limit, both in the disordered and in the\nlow temperature phase. Finite-\u03c4 corrections are shown to obey a scaling behavior.\nPACS numbers: 05.70.Ln; 05.40.-a; 75.40.Gb\n\nIn equilibrium statistical mechanics expressions for the\nprobability of different microstates, such as the Gibbs\nweight in the canonical ensemble, are the starting point\nof a successful theory which allows the description of a\nbroad class of systems. A key-point of this approach is\nits generality. Specific aspects, such as, for instance, the\nkinetic rules or the details of the interactions with the\nexternal reservoirs are irrelevant for the properties of the\nequilibrium state.\nIn non-equilibrium systems general expressions for\nprobability distributions are not available; however, the\nrecent proposal [1, 2, 3] of relations governing the fluctuations is of great interest. They were formalized, for\na class of dynamical systems, as a theorem for the entropy production in stationary states [3]. Fluctuation\nRelations (FRs) have been established successively for\na broad class of stochastic and deterministic systems\n[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] (see [12] for recent reviews).\nThey are expected to be relevant in nano\u2013 and biological\nsciences [13] at scales where typical thermal fluctuations\nare of the same magnitude of the external drivings. Testing the generality of FRs and the mechanisms of their\noccurrence in experiments [14, 15] or numerical simulations, particularly for interacting systems, is therefore an\nimportant issue in basic statistical mechanics and applications.\nIn this work we consider the case of non equilibrium\nsteady states of systems in contact with two different\nheat baths at temperatures Tn (n = 1, 2). In this case the\nFR, also known as Gallavotti-Cohen relation [3], connects\nthe probability P(Q(n) (\u03c4 )) to exchange the heat Q(n) (\u03c4 )\nwith the n-th reservoir in a time interval \u03c4 , to that of\nexchanging the opposite quantity \u2212Q(n) (\u03c4 ), according to\nln\nwhere \u2206\u03b2 (1)\n\nP(Q(n) (\u03c4 ))\n= Q(n) (\u03c4 )\u2206\u03b2 (n) ,\n(1)\nP(\u2212Q(n) (\u03c4 ))\n\u0011\n\u0010\n= T12 \u2212 T11 and \u2206\u03b2 (2) = \u2212\u2206\u03b2 (1) . This\n\nrelation is expected to hold in the large \u03c4 limit; in particular \u03c4 must be much larger than the relaxation times\nin the system. An explicit derivation of (1) for stochastic\nsystems can be found in [16]. In specific systems, the\nvalidity of (1) was shown for a chain of oscillators [17]\ncoupled at the extremities to two thermostats while the\ncase of a brownian particle in contact with two reservoirs has been studied in [18]. A relation similar to\n(1) has been also proved for the heat exchanged between\ntwo systems initially prepared in equilibrium at different\ntemperatures and later put in contact [19].\nThe purpose of this Letter is to study the relation (1),\nand the pre-asymptotic corrections at finite \u03c4 , in Ising\nmodels in contact with two reservoirs, as a paradigmatic\nexample of statistical systems with phase transitions.\nThis issue was considered analytically in a mean field\napproximation in [20] where the distributions P(Q(n) (\u03c4 ))\nhave been explicitly computed in the large \u03c4 limit. Here\nwe study numerically the model with short range interactions. This allows us to analyze the generality of the\nFR (1) with respect to details of the kinetics and of the\ninteractions with the reservoirs, and to study the effects\nof finite \u03c4 . We also investigate the interplay between\nergodicity breaking and the FRs.\nWe consider a two\u2013dimensional\nIsing model defined by\nP\nthe Hamiltonian H = \u2212J hiji \u03c3i \u03c3j , where \u03c3i = \u00b11 is a\nspin variable on a site i of a rectangular lattice with N =\nM \u00d7 L sites, and the sum is over all pairs hiji of nearest\nneighbors. A generic evolution of the system is given by\nthe sequence of configurations {\u03c31 (t), . . . , \u03c3N (t)} where\n\u03c3i (t) is the value of the spin variable at time t. We will\nstudy the behavior of the system in the stationary state.\nIn order to see the effects of different kinetics, Montecarlo single\u2013spin\u2013flip and spin-exchange (Kawasaki) dynamics have been considered, corresponding to systems\nwith non-conserved or conserved magnetization, respectively. Metropolis transition rates have been used; for\n\n\f2\n\n(n)\n\n{tk }\u2282[s,s+\u03c4 ]\n\nIn the stationary state, the properties of Q(n) (\u03c4 ) will be\ncomputed by collecting the statistics over different subtrajectories obtained by dividing a long history of length\ntF into many (tF /\u03c4 ) time-windows of length \u03c4 , starting\nfrom different s.\nT1 , T2 > Tc . We begin our analysis with the study of\nthe relation (1) in the case with both temperatures well\nabove the critical value Tc \u2243 2.269 of the equilibrium\nIsing model. In the following we will measure times in\nmontecarlo steps (MCS) (1 MCS=N elementary moves).\nThe typical behavior of the heat probability distribution (PD) is reported in the upper panel of Fig.1\nfor the case with static coupling to the baths, single\u2013\nspin\u2013flip with Metropolis transition rates, T1 = 2.9,\nT2 = 3, and a square geometry with L = M = 10\n(Much larger sizes are not suitable because trajectories\n\n0,04\n\nQ1, \u03c4=150\nQ1, \u03c4=400\nQ1, \u03c4=1000\nQ2, \u03c4=150\nQ2, \u03c4=400\nQ2, \u03c4=1000\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c3\u03c4 P(Q )\n\n0,4\n\n(n)\n\nP(Q )\n\n(1)\n\n0,03\n\n0,02\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n[Q -<Q >]/\u03c3\u03c4\n\n0,2\n\n(1)\n\n0,01\n\n0\n-500\n\n0\n\n500\n\n(n)\n\nQ\n\nQ1, \u03c4=4000\nQ1, \u03c4=10000\nQ1, \u03c4=40000\nQ2, \u03c4=4000\nQ2, \u03c4=10000\nQ2, \u03c4=40000\n\n0,25\n\n0,2\n\n(n)\n\nP(Q )\n\nsingle\u2013spin\u2013flip dynamics we also used Glauber transition rates.\nRegarding the interactions with the reservoirs we have\nconsidered two different implementations. In the first,\nthe system is statically divided into two halves. The left\npart (the first M/2 vertical lines) of the system interacts\nwith the heat bath at temperature T1 while the right part\nis in contact with the reservoir at T2 > T1 . We have used\nboth open or periodic boundary conditions. In the second implementation (for single\u2013spin\u2013flip only) each spin\n\u03c3i , at a given time t, is put dynamically in contact with\none or the other reservoir depending\non the (time depenP\ndent) value of hi = (1/2)| hjii \u03c3j |, where the sum runs\nover the nearest neighbor spins \u03c3j of \u03c3i . Notice that hi\nis one half of the (absolute value) of the local field. In\ntwo dimensions, with periodic boundary conditions, the\npossible values of hi are hi = 0, 1, 2. At each time, spins\nwith hi = 1 are connected to the bath at T = T1 and\nthose with hi = 2 with the reservoir at T = T2 . Namely,\nwhen a particular spin \u03c3i is updated, the temperature\nT1 or T2 is entered into the transition rate according to\nthe value of hi . Loose spins with hi = 0 can flip back\nand forth regardless of temperature because these moves\ndo not change the energy of the system. Then, as in\nthe usual Ising model, they are associated to a temperature independent transition rate (equal to 1/2 or 1 for\nGlauber or Metropolis transition rates). This model was\nintroduced in [21] and further studied in [22]. It is characterized by a line of critical points in the plane T1 , T2 ,\nseparating a ferromagnetic from a paramagnetic phase\nanalogously to the equilibrium Ising model.\n(n)\nDenoting with tk the times at which an elementary\nmove is attempted by coupling the system to the n-th\nreservoir, the heat released by the bath in a time window\nt \u2282 [s, s + \u03c4 ] is defined as\nX\n(n)\n(n)\nQ(n) (\u03c4 ) =\n[H(\u03c3(tk ))\u2212H(\u03c3(tk \u22121))].

Lower panel (T1 , T2 < Tc ): \u01eb(2) is plotted against \u03c4 /L for different L.\n\nwith good accuracy, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1,\nwhere data collapse of the curves with different \u03c4\n(1)\nis observed by plotting (\u03c3\u03c4 )1/2 P(Q(1) (\u03c4 )) against\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(Q (\u03c4 ) \u2212 hQ (\u03c4 )i)/\u03c3\u03c4 .\nIn order to study the FR (1), we plot the logarithm\nof the ratio P(Q(n) (\u03c4 ))/P(\u2212Q(n) (\u03c4 )) as a function of\n\u2206\u03b2 (n) Q(n) (\u03c4 ), see Fig. 2 (inset). For every value of \u03c4\nthe data are well consistent with a linear relationship\n(however, for large values of the heat the statistics becomes poor), in agreement with the gaussian form of the\nPDs. To verify the FR (1), the slopes of the plot\n(n)\n\nD\n\n(n)\n\n(\u03c4 ) =\n\nP(Q (\u03c4 ))\nln P(\u2212Q\n(n) (\u03c4 ))\n\nQ(n) (\u03c4 )\u2206\u03b2 (n)\n\n(4)\n\n(3)\n\nmust tend to 1 when \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e. We show in Fig.2 the\nbehavior of the distance \u01eb(n) = 1 \u2212 D(n) (\u03c4 ) from the\nasymptotic behavior, for the case with static coupling to\nthe baths. This quantity indeed goes to zero for large \u03c4\n(the same is found for dynamic couplings). \u01eb(n) depends\n\n\u2206E\n.\nTn\u2032 Q(n) (\u03c4 )\u2206\u03b2 (n)\n\n(5)\n\nWe now assume that the behavior of \u01eb(n) can be inferred by replacing \u2206E and Q(n) (\u03c4 ) with their average\nvalues whose behavior can be estimated by scaling arguments. Starting with the average of Q(n) (\u03c4 ), we argue that this quantity is proportional to Nf lux \u03c4 , Nf lux\nbeing the number of couples of nearest neighbor spins\ninteracting with baths at different temperatures. This\nis because between these spins a neat heat flux occurs.\nIn the model with static coupling to the baths one has\nNf lux \u221d L. With dynamic coupling, instead, since every\nspin in the system can feel one or the other temperature,\none has Nf lux \u221d N . Concerning the average of \u2206E, this\nis an extensive quantity proportional to the number N\nof spins. We then arrive at\n\u001a\nL\u03c4 \u22121\nstatic coupling to baths\n(n) \u22121\n(n)\n\u2032\n\u01eb \u2243 (Tn \u2206\u03b2 )\n\u03c4 \u22121\ndynamic coupling to baths.\n(6)\nThis result is expected to apply for sufficiently large \u03c4\nwhen our scaling approach holds.\nWe remind that finite-\u03c4 corrections have been shown\nto be of order 1/\u03c4 for the classes of dynamical systems\nconsidered in [3, 23]. The same is found in [24] for models\nbased on a Langevin equation [25], in cases corresponding to the experimental setup of a resistor in parallel with\na capacitor [15]. Faster decays (\u223c 1/\u03c4 2 ) have been predicted for other topologies of circuits [24]. On the other\nhand, FRs in transient regimes, which are not considered\nin this Communication, are exact at any \u03c4 (\u01eb = 0, \u2200\u03c4 )\n[26].\nIn our model with static couplings the data of Fig. 2\nconfirm the prediction of the argument above: curves\n\n\f4\nwith different L collapse when plotted against x = \u03c4 /L\nand \u01eb(n) \u221d x\u22121 for sufficiently large \u03c4 . Similar behaviors have been found by varying the geometry (we also\nconsidered rectangular lattices with L > M ), transition\nrates, and dynamics. The scaling prediction (6) has been\nverified for the Ising model with Kawasaki dynamics and\nsquared geometry with L = 10, 20, 40, and in the case\nof the system dynamically coupled to the heat baths for\nsizes between L = 6 and L = 60.\nT1 , T2 < Tc\nLet us first recall the behavior of the Ising model in\ncontact with a single bath at temperature T < Tc . When\nN = \u221e the system is confined into one of the two pure\nstates which can be distinguished\nby the sign of the magPN\nnetization m(T ) = (1/N ) i=1 \u03c3i . This state is characterized by a microscopic relaxation time \u03c4eq (T ) which is\nrelated to the fast flip of correlated spins into thermal\nislands with the typical size of the coherence length. At\nfinite N , instead, genuine ergodicity breaking does not\noccur. The system still remains trapped into the basin\nof attraction of the pure states but only for a finite ergodic time \u03c4erg (N, T ), which diverges when N \u2192 \u221e or\nT \u2192 0. Then, as compared to the case T > Tc , there is\nthe additional timescale \u03c4erg (N, T ), beside \u03c4eq (T ), which\ncan become macroscopic. This whole phenomenology is\nreflected by the\nP behavior of the autocorrelation function\nC(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) = h i \u03c3i (t\u2032 )\u03c3i (t)i. When, for large N , the two\ntimescales \u03c4eq (T ), \u03c4erg (N, T ) are well separated, it first\ndecays from C(0) = 1 to a plateau C(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) = m(T )2\non times t \u2212 t\u2032 \u2243 \u03c4eq (T ), due to the fast decorrelation\nof spins in thermal islands. The later decay from the\nplateau to zero, observed on a much larger timescale\nt \u2212 t\u2032 \u2243 \u03c4erg (N, T ), signals the recovery of ergodicity.\nNotice also that, from the behavior of C(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) both the\ncharacteristic timescales can be extracted.\nThe same picture applies qualitatively to the case of\ntwo subsystems in contact with two thermal baths, where\neach systems is trapped in states with broken symmetry\nfor a time \u03c4erg (N, Tn ) (\u03c4erg (N, T1 ) > \u03c4erg (N, T2 ) since\nT1 < T2 ), which can be evaluated from the autocorrelaP (n)\n(n)\ntion functions C (n) (t \u2212 t\u2032 ) = h i \u03c3i (t)\u03c3i (t\u2032 )i, where\n(n)\n\u03c3i denote spins in contact with the bath at T = Tn .\nSince the FR is expected for \u03c4 larger than the typical\ntimescales of the system, it is interesting to study the\nrole of the additional timescales \u03c4erg (N, Tn ) on the FR.\nBy varying T1 , T2 and N appropriately one can realize the\nlimit of large \u03c4 in the two cases with i) \u03c4 \u226a \u03c4erg (N, T2 )\nor ii) \u03c4 \u226b \u03c4erg (N, T1 ). In case i), in the observation timewindow \u03c4 , the system is practically confined into broken\nsymmetry states while in case ii) ergodicity is restored.\nNot surprisingly, in the latter case, we have observed a\nbehavior very similar to that with T1 , T2 > Tc . The PDs\nfor the case i) are shown in the lower panel of Fig. 1. The\ndistributions are more narrow and non Gaussian. We\n\ncalculated the skewness of the distributions defined as\n< (Q(\u03c4 )\u2212 < Q(\u03c4 ) >)3 > / < (Q(\u03c4 )\u2212 < Q(\u03c4 ) >)2 >3/2 .\nThis quantity is zero for gaussian distributions while for\nthe case of the lower panel of Fig. 1 we found values different from zero which have been reported in the caption of\nthe figure. This data show that the PDs slowly approach\na Gaussian form increasing \u03c4 . Moreover, differently than\nin the high temperature case, an asymmetry between the\ndistributions of Q(1) (\u03c4 ) and Q(2) (\u03c4 ) can be observed.\nRegarding the slopes D(n) (\u03c4 ), they converge to 1 also\nin this case even if the times required to reach the asymptotic behavior are much longer than in the high temperature case (but always smaller than \u03c4erg (N, T2 )). This\nsuggests that the FR (1) holds even in states where ergodicity is broken and that the presence of the macroscopic\ntimescales \u03c4erg (N, Tn ) does not affect the validity of the\nFR in this system. Regarding the scaling of \u01eb(n) , the\ndata are much more noisy than in the case T1 , T2 > Tc ,\nparticularly for \u01eb(1) . Despite this, the data presented in\nthe lower panel of Fig.2 for \u01eb(2) are consistent with the\nscaling (6) suggesting that it is correct also in this situation.\nIn this Letter we have considered different realizations\nof Ising models coupled to two heat baths at different\ntemperature. We studied the fluctuation behavior of the\nheat exchanged with the thermostats and found that the\nFR (1) is asymptotically verified in all the cases considered. We also analyzed the effects of finite time corrections and their scaling behavior. The picture is qualitatively similar in the high and low temperature phases,\nalthough very different timescales are required to observe\nthe asymptotic FR.\nThe authors are grateful to A.
