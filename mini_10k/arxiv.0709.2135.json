These experiments show that two\nnearby qubits can be readily coupled with local interactions. Performing gates between an arbitrary\npair of distant qubits is highly desirable for any quantum computer architecture, but has not yet\nbeen demonstrated. An efficient way to achieve this goal is to couple the qubits to a quantum bus,\nwhich distributes quantum information among the qubits. Here we show the implementation of\nsuch a quantum bus, using microwave photons confined in a transmission line cavity, to couple two\nsuperconducting qubits on opposite sides of a chip. The interaction is mediated by the exchange\nof virtual rather than real photons, avoiding cavity induced loss. Using fast control of the qubits\nto switch the coupling effectively on and off, we demonstrate coherent transfer of quantum states\nbetween the qubits. The cavity is also used to perform multiplexed control and measurement of\nthe qubit states. This approach can be expanded to more than two qubits, and is an attractive\narchitecture for quantum information processing on a chip.\n\nThere are several physical systems in which one could\nrealize a quantum bus. A particular example is trapped\nions10,11 in which a variety of quantum operations and\nalgorithms have been performed using the quantized\nmotion of the ions (phonons) as the bus. Photons\nare another natural candidate as a carrier of quantum\ninformation12,13 , because they are highly coherent and\ncan mediate interactions between distant objects. To\ncreate a photon bus, it is helpful to utilize the increased\ninteraction strength provided by the techniques of cavity quantum electrodynamics, where an atom is coupled to a single cavity mode. In the strong coupling\nlimit14 the interaction is coherent, permitting the transfer of quantum information between the atom and the\nphoton. Entanglement between atoms has been demonstrated with Rydberg atom cavity QED15,16,17 . Circuit\nQED18 is a realization of the physics of cavity QED with\nsuperconducting qubits coupled to a microwave cavity\non a chip. Previous circuit QED experiments with single qubits have achieved19 the strong coupling limit and\nhave demonstrated20 the transfer of quantum information from qubit to photon. Here we perform a circuit\nQED experiment with two qubits strongly coupled to a\ncavity, and demonstrate a coherent, non-local coupling\nbetween the qubits via this bus.\nOperations with multiple superconducting qubits have\nbeen performed and are a subject of current research.\nThe first solid-state quantum gate has been demonstrated with charge qubits3 . For flux qubits, two-qubit\ncoupling5 and a controllable coupling mechanism have\nbeen realized7,8,9 . Two phase qubits have also been successfully coupled4 and the entanglement between them\nhas been observed6 . All of these interactions have been\nrealized by connecting qubits via lumped circuit ele-\n\nments, with capacitive coupling in the case of charge\nand phase qubits, and inductive coupling for flux qubits.\nTherefore, these coupling mechanisms have been restricted to local interactions and couple only nearest\nneighbor qubits. In this work, we present a coupling\nthat is realized with a cavity, which is a distributed circuit element, rather than with the lumped elements used\npreviously. The interaction between the qubits occurs\nvia photons in the cavity; hence, the cavity acts as an\ninteraction bus allowing a non-local coupling of multiple\nqubits.\nTo realize the cavity bus, we place two superconducting\nqubits 5 mm apart at opposite ends of a superconducting transmission line resonator (Fig. 1a, 1b). The qubits\nare transmons21 , a modified version of the Cooper-pair\nbox. In this type of qubit, the Josephson energy is larger\nthan the charging energy (EJ \u001d EC ) and the transition frequency between the ground\nstate and the first\n\u221a\nexcited state is given by \u03c9 \u2248 8EJ EC /h\u0304. The Josephson junctions are arranged in a split-pair geometry, so\nthat the Josephson energy, EJ = EJmax |cos(\u03c0\u03a6/\u03a60 )| depends on the magnetic flux \u03a6 applied through the splitpair loop. Hence,\np the transition frequency of the qubits,\nmax\n\u03c91,2 = \u03c91,2\n|cos(\u03c0\u03a6/\u03a60 )| can be tuned in-situ with\nthe applied flux. The size of the two loops is different\nand incommensurate, so that control of the two transition frequencies is attainable with a certain degree of\nindependence. To probe the state of the system, homodyne detection of the transmitted signal is performed and\nboth quadrature voltages are recorded, which allows reconstruction of the phase and amplitude of the transmitted signal.\nIn the first measurement we observe strong coupling of\neach of the qubits separately to the cavity.

Whenever a qubit and the\ncavity are degenerate, the transmission is split into two\nwell-resolved peaks in frequency, an effect called vacuum\nRabi splitting19 , demonstrating that each qubit is in the\nstrong coupling limit with the cavity.

Circuit a and optical micrograph\nb of the chip with two transmon qubits coupled by a microwave cavity. The cavity is formed by a coplanar waveguide\n(light blue) interrupted by two coupling capacitors (purple).\nThe resonant frequency of the cavity is \u03c9r /2\u03c0 = 5.19 GHz\nand its width is \u03ba/2\u03c0 = 33 MHz, determined be the coupling\ncapacitors. The cavity is operated as a half-wave resonator\n(L = \u03bb/2 = 12.3 mm) and the electric field in the cavity is indicated by the gray line. The two transmon qubits (optimized\nCooper-pair boxes) are located at opposite ends of the cavity\nwhere the electric field has an antinode. Each transmon qubit\nconsists of two superconducting islands connected by a pair of\nJosephson junctions and an extra shunting capacitor (interdigitated finger structure in the green inset). The left qubit\n(qubit 1) has a charging energy of EC 1 /h = 424MHz and maximum Josephson energy of EJ max\n/h = 14.9 GHz. The right\n1\nqubit (qubit 2) has a charging energy of EC 2 /h = 442 MHz\nand maximum Josephson energy of EJ max\n/h = 18.9 GHz.\n2\nThe loop area between the Josephson junctions for the two\ntransmon qubits differs by a factor of approximately 5/8, allowing a differential flux bias. The microwave signals enter\nthe chip from the left, and the response of the cavity is amplified and measured on the right. c Scheme of the dispersive\nqubit-qubit coupling. When the qubits are detuned from the\ncavity (|\u22061,2 | = |\u03c91,2 \u2212 \u03c9r | \u001d g1,2 ) the qubits both dispersively shift the cavity. The excited state in the left qubit\n|\u2191\u2193 0i interacts with the excited state in the right qubit |\u2193\u2191 0i\nvia the exchange of a virtual photon |\u2193\u2193 1i in the cavity.\n\n0.30\n\n0.465\n\n0.460\n\nMagnetic Field (Gauss)\n\n0.465\n\nFIG. 2: Cavity transmission and spectroscopy of single and\ncoupled qubits. a The transmission through the cavity as a\nfunction of applied magnetic field is shown in the frequency\nrange between 5 GHz and 5.4 GHz. When either of the qubits\nis in resonance with the cavity, the cavity transmission shows\nan avoided crossing due to the vacuum Rabi splitting. The\nmaximal vacuum Rabi splitting for the two qubits is the same\nwithin the measurement uncertainty and is \u223c105 MHz. Above\n5.5 GHz, spectroscopic measurements of the two qubit transitions are displayed. A second microwave signal is used to excite the qubit and the dispersive shift of the cavity frequency\nis measured. The dashed lines show the resonance frequencies\nof the two qubits, whichpare a function of the applied flux acmax\n|cos(\u03c0\u03a6/\u03a60 )|. The maximum trancording to \u03c91,2 = \u03c91,2\nsition frequency for the first qubit is \u03c91max /2\u03c0 = 7.8 GHz and\nfor the second qubit is \u03c92max /2\u03c0 = 6.45 GHz. For strong drive\npowers, additional resonances between higher qubit levels are\nvisible. b Spectroscopy of the two-qubit crossing. The qubit\nlevels show a clear avoided crossing with a minimal distance\nof 2J/2\u03c0 = 26MHz. At the crossing the eigenstates of the system are symmetric and anti-symmetric superpositions of the\ntwo qubit states. The spectroscopic drive is anti-symmetric\nand therefore unable to drive any transitions to the symmetric state, resulting in a dark state. c Predicted spectroscopy\nat the qubit-qubit crossing using a Markovian master equation that takes into account higher modes of the cavity. The\nparameters for this calculation are obtained from the vacuum\nRabi splitting and the single qubit spectroscopy.\n\ncorresponds to a superposition of qubit excitation and a\ncavity photon in which the energy is shared between the\ntwo systems. From the frequency difference at the maximal splitting, the coupling parameters g1,2 \u2248 105 MHz\ncan be determined for each qubit. The transition frequency of each of the two qubits (see Fig. 2a) can also\nbe measured far from the cavity frequency as described\nbelow.\nIn the remainder of the experiment we operate the sys-\n\n\f3\n\na)\nPolarization\n5.18\n\n5.20\n\n5.22\n\n5.24\n\nc)\n\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\n0\n\n5.26\n\nFrequency (GHz)\nHomodyne Voltage (mV)\n\n0\n\nb)\n\n0.5\n\nTransmission\n\n1\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nRabi Pulse Length (ns)\n\n6\n\nd)\n\n4\n2\n0\n-100\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\nTime (ns)\nFIG. 3: Multiplexed control and read-out of uncoupled qubits. a Predicted cavity transmission for the four uncoupled qubit\nstates. In the dispersive limit (|\u22061,2 | = |\u03c91,2 \u2212 \u03c9r | \u001d g1,2 ), the frequency is shifted by \u03c71 \u03c31z + \u03c72 \u03c32z . Operating the qubits\nat transition frequencies \u03c91 /2\u03c0 = 6.617 GHz and \u03c92 /2\u03c0 = 6.529 GHz, we find \u03c71 /2\u03c0 = \u22125.9 MHz and \u03c72 /2\u03c0 = \u22127.4 MHz.\nMeasurement is achieved by placing a probe at a frequency where the four cavity transmissions are distinguishable. The twoqubit state can then be reconstructed from the homodyne measurement of the cavity. Rabi oscillations of b qubit 1 and c qubit\n2. A drive pulse of increasing duration is applied at the qubit transition frequency and the response of the cavity transmission\nis measured after the pulse is turned off. Oscillations of quadrature voltages are measured for each of the qubits and mapped\nz\nonto the polarization h\u03c31,2\ni. The solid line shows results from a master equation simulation, which takes into account the\nfull dynamics of the two qubits and the cavity. The absence of beating in both traces is a signature of the suppression of the\nqubit-qubit coupling at this detuning. d The homodyne response (average of 1,000,000 traces) of the cavity after a \u03c0 pulse\non qubit 1 (green), qubit 2 (red), and both qubits (blue). The black trace shows the level when no pulses are applied. The\ncontrasts22 (i.e. the amplitude of the pulse relative to its ideal maximum value) for these pulses are 60% (green), 61% (green)\nand 65% (blue). The solid line shows the simulated value including the qubit relaxation and the turn-on time of the cavity.\nThe agreement between the theoretical prediction and the data indicates the measured contrast is the maximum observable.\nFrom the theoretical calculation one can estimate the selectivity (see text for details) for each \u03c0-pulse to be 87% (qubit 1) and\n94% (qubit 2). We note that this figure of merit is not at all intrinsic and that it could be improved by increasing the detuning\nbetween the two qubits for instance, or using shaped excitation pulses.\n\ntem in the dispersive limit, where both qubits are detuned from the resonator (|\u22061,2 | = |\u03c91,2 \u2212 \u03c9r | \u001d g1,2 ).\nIn this limit, we use second order perturbation theory\nand the full system with the two qubits and the cavity is\ndescribed by the effective Hamiltonian23 :\nHeff =\n\nh\u0304\u03c91 z h\u0304\u03c92 z\n\u03c3 +\n\u03c3 + h\u0304 (\u03c9r + \u03c71 \u03c31z + \u03c72 \u03c32z ) a\u2020 a\n2 1\n2 2\n\u0001\n+h\u0304J \u03c31\u2212 \u03c32+ + \u03c32\u2212 \u03c31+\n\nIn this regime, no energy is exchanged with the cavity. However, the qubits and cavity are still dispersively coupled, resulting in a qubit-state-dependent shift\n\u00b1\u03c71,2 of the cavity frequency (see Fig. 3a) or equivalently an AC Stark shift of the qubit frequencies24 . The\nfrequency shift \u03c71,2 can be calculated from the detuning \u22061,2 and the measured coupling strength g1,2 21 . The\nlast term describes the interaction between the qubits,\n\nwhich is a transverse exchange interaction of strength\nJ = g1 g2 (1/\u22061 + 1/\u22062 )/2 (See Fig. 1c). The qubitqubit interaction is a result of virtual exchange of photons with the cavity. When the qubits are degenerate\nwith each other, an excitation in one qubit can be transferred to the other qubit by virtually becoming a photon\nin the cavity (see Fig. 3b). However, when the qubits\nare non-degenerate |\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92 | \u001d J this process does not\nconserve energy, and therefore the interaction is effectively turned off. Thus, instead of modifying the actual\ncoupling constant7,8,9 , we control the effective coupling\nstrength by tuning the qubit transition frequencies. This\nis possible since the qubit-qubit coupling is transverse,\nwhich also distinguishes our experiment from the situation in liquid-state NMR quantum computation, where\nan effective switching-off can only be achieved by repeatedly applying decoupling pulses25 .\n\n\f4\n\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\nc)\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.2\n0.0\n6.35\n\n0.0\n\n0\n6.40\n\n6.45\n\n6.50\n\nStark Pulse\n-130\n\n-100\n\nMeasurement\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nStark Pulse Length\n\nFrequency (GHz)\n\nb)\n\n0\n\n6.55\n\n50\n\nTime (ns)\n\nFrequency (MHz)\n\nStark Tone Power (mW)\n\n2\n\nNumber of Photons\n\n1.4\n\na)\n\nHomodyne Voltage (mV)\n\n1.2\n1.6\n\n50\n\n100\n\n(ns)\n\nd)\nFrequency Splitting\nOscillation Frequency\n\n40\n30\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\nStark Power (mW)\nFIG. 4: Controllable effective coupling and coherent state transfer via off-resonant Stark shift. a Spectroscopy of qubits\nversus applied Stark tone power. Taking into account an attenuation of 67 dB before the cavity and the filtering effect of\nthe cavity, 0.77 mW corresponds to an average of one photon in the resonator. The qubit transition frequencies (starting at\n\u03c91 /2\u03c0 = 6.469 GHz and \u03c92 /2\u03c0 = 6.546 GHz) are brought into resonance with a Stark pulse applied at 6.675 GHz. An avoided\ncrossing is observed with one of the qubit transition levels becoming dark as in Figure 2. b Protocol for the coherent state\ntransfer using the Stark shift. The pulse sequence consists of a Gaussian-shaped \u03c0 pulse (red) on one of the qubits at its\ntransition frequency \u03c91,2 followed by a Stark pulse (brown) of varying duration \u2206t and amplitude A detuned from the qubits,\nand finally a square measurement pulse (blue) at the cavity frequency. The time between the \u03c0 pulse and the measurement\nis kept fixed at 130 ns. c Coherent state transfer between the qubits according to the protocol above. The plot shows the\nmeasured homodyne voltage (average of 3,000,000 traces) with the \u03c0 pulse applied to qubit 1 (green dots) and to qubit 2 (red\ndots) as a function of the Stark pulse length \u2206t. For reference, the black dots show the signal without any \u03c0 pulse applied\nto either qubit. The overall increase of the signal is caused by the residual Rabi driving due to the off-resonant Stark tone,\nwhich is also reproduced by the theory. Improved designs featuring different coupling strengths for the individual qubits could\neasily avoid this effect. The thin solid lines show the signal in the absence of a Stark pulse. Adding the background trace\n(black dots) to these, we construct the curves consisting of open circles, which correctly reproduce the upper and lower limits\nof the oscillating signals due to coherent state transfer. d The oscillation frequency (red) of the time domain state transfer\nmeasurement (c) and the splitting frequency (blue) of the continuous wave spectroscopy (a) versus power of the Stark tone.\nThe agreement shows that the oscillations are indeed due to the coupling between the qubits.\n\nWe first observe the coherent interaction between the\ntwo qubits via the cavity by performing spectroscopy of\ntheir transition frequencies (see Fig. 2). This is done\nby monitoring the change in cavity transmission when\nthe qubits are probed by a second microwave signal.\nBy applying a magnetic flux the qubits can be tuned\nthrough resonance with each other (see Fig. 2b), revealing an avoided crossing. The magnitude of the splitting\nagrees well with the theoretical value 2J = 2g1 g2 /\u2206 =\n2\u03c0 * 26 MHz when one takes into account that g1,2 vary\nwith frequency for a transmon qubit21 . The splitting\nis well resolved, with a magnitude J much greater than\nthe qubit line widths, indicating a coherent coupling and\nthat the qubits are in the strong dispersive limit26 . Note\nthat although the coupling strength J is smaller than the\ncavity decay rate \u03ba/2\u03c0 \u223c 33 MHz, the avoided crossing\nis nearly unaffected by the cavity loss. This is possible in\n\nsuch a large-\u03ba cavity, required for fast measurements, because only virtual photons are exchanged; if real photons\nwere used, the cavity induced relaxation of the qubits\n(Purcell effect20 ) would make coherent state transfer unfeasible.\nAnother manifestation of the coherence of this interaction is the observation of a dark state. One observes a\ndisappearance of the spectroscopic signal near the crossing point, which is due to destructive interference associated with the fact that the qubits are separated by\nhalf a wavelength. At the crossing, the eigenstates are\nsuperpositions of the single qubit states. In particular,\nthe state with lower frequency is the symmetric triplet\nstate |\u2193\u2191i + |\u2191\u2193i and the state at higher frequency is\nthe antisymmetric singlet state |\u2193\u2191i \u2212 |\u2191\u2193i. In the dispersive limit, the spectroscopic excitation is of the form\n\u03c31x g1 /\u22061 \u2212 \u03c32x g2 /\u22062 , where the negative sign is due\n\n\f5\nto the opposite signs of the electric field at the different ends of the \u03bb/2 cavity as shown in Fig. 1a, 1b. Thus,\nsuch an external signal applied to the cavity cannot drive\nany transitions to the symmetric state, and is therefore\ndark. Moreover, just as the triplet state does not couple to the drive, it is protected against decay through\nthe cavity. Conversely, the decay from the singlet state\nis enhanced, similar to super-radiant effects observed in\natomic physics27,28 . Figure 2c shows the calculated spectroscopy at the qubit-qubit crossing, which reproduces\nall qualitative features of the measured data.\nIn addition to acting as a quantum bus, the cavity can\nalso be used for multiplexed read-out and control of the\ntwo qubits. Here, \"multiplexed\" refers to acquisition of\ninformation or control of more than one qubit via a single channel. To address the qubits independently, the\nflux is tuned such that the qubit frequencies are 88 MHz\napart (\u03c91 = 6.617 GHz, \u03c92 = 6.529 GHz), making the\nqubit-qubit coupling negligible. Rabi experiments showing individual control are performed by applying an rfpulse at the resonant frequency of either qubit, followed\nby a measurement pulse at the resonator frequency. The\nresponse (see Fig. 3b and 3c) is consistent with that of\na single qubit oscillation and shows no beating, indicating that the coupling does not affect single-qubit operations and read-out. With similar measurements the relaxation times (T1 ) of the two qubits are determined to\nbe 78 ns and 120 ns, and with Ramsey measurements the\ncoherence times (T2 ) are found to be 120 ns and 160 ns.\nThe ability to simultaneously read-out the states of both\nqubits using a single line is shown by measuring the cavity phase shift, proportional to \u03c71 \u03c31z + \u03c72 \u03c32z (see Eq. 1),\nafter applying a \u03c0-pulse to one or both of the qubits.\nFigure 3d shows the response of the cavity after a \u03c0pulse has been applied on the first qubit (green points),\non the second qubit (red points) or on both qubits (blue\npoints). For comparison the response of the cavity without any pulse applied (black points) is shown. Since the\ncavity frequency shifts for the two qubits are different\n(\u03c71 6= \u03c72 ), so we are able to distinguish the four states\n|\u2193\u2193i , |\u2193\u2191i , |\u2191\u2193i , |\u2191\u2191i of the qubits with a single read-out\nline. One can show that this measurement, with sufficient signal to noise and combined with single-qubit rotations, should in principle allow for a full reconstruction\nof the density matrix (state tomography)6 , although not\ndemonstrated in the present experiment.\nThe solid lines in Figure 3d show the results from a\ntheoretical calculation taking into account the full dynamics of the cavity and the two qubits, including the\nrelaxation in the qubits. The agreement of the theory with the measured response shows that the measured contrast is the maximum expected. From the calculated values one can estimate the selectivity, i.e. the\nability to address one qubit without affecting the other,\nS = (Pa \u2212 Pu )/(Pa + Pu ), where Pa and Pu are the maximum populations in the excited state of the addressed\nqubit and in the excited state of the unaddressed qubit,\nrespectively. The selectivity for qubit 1 is 87 % and qubit\n\n2 is 94 %, which indicates good individual control of the\nqubits.\nWe can perform coherent state transfer in the time\ndomain by rapidly turning the effective qubit-qubit coupling on and off. Rather than the slow flux tuning discussed above, we now make use of a strongly detuned\nrf-drive23 , which results in an off-resonant Stark shift of\nthe qubit frequencies on the nanosecond time scale. Figure 4a shows the spectroscopy of the two qubits when\nthis off-resonant Stark drive is applied with increasing\npower. The qubit frequencies are pushed into resonance\nand a similar avoided crossing is observed as in Fig. 2b.\nWith the Stark drive's ability to quickly tune the qubits\ninto resonance, it is possible to observe coherent oscillations between the qubits, using the following protocol\n(see Fig. 4b): Initially the qubits are 80 MHz detuned\nfrom each other, where their effective coupling is small,\nand they are allowed to relax to the ground state |\u2193\u2193i.\nNext, a \u03c0-pulse is applied to one of the qubits to either create the state |\u2191\u2193i or |\u2193\u2191i. Then a Stark pulse of\npower PAC is applied bringing the qubits into resonance\nfor a variable time \u2206t. Since |\u2191\u2193i and |\u2193\u2191i are not eigenstates of the coupled system, oscillations between these\ntwo states occur, as shown in Fig. 4c. Fig. 4d shows the\nfrequency of these oscillations for different powers PAC of\nthe Stark pulse, which agrees with the frequency domain\nmeasurement of the frequency splitting observed in Fig.\n4a. These data are strong evidence that the oscillations\nare due to the coupling between the qubits and that the\nstate of the qubits is transferred from one to the other. A\nquarter\nperiod of these oscillations should correspond to\n\u221a\na iSWAP, which would be a universal gate. Future experiments will seek to demonstrate the performance and\naccuracy of this state transfer.\nThe observed qubit-qubit avoided crossing and the coherent state transfer demonstrate that the cavity can act\nas a coupling bus for superconducting qubits. The interaction is coherent and effectively switchable; furthermore, the coupling is long range, can easily be extended\nto non-nearest neighbors, and it is protected against loss\nin the bus by the use of virtual photons. This architecture is not restricted to two qubits as there is room\nto couple many more qubits to the cavity, opening up\nnew possibilities for quantum information processing on\na chip.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported in part by the National Security Agency under the Army Research Office, by the NSF,\nand by Yale University.
