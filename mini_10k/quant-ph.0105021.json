A substantial difference between the dynamics of wavepackets corresponding to circular and linear orbits of\na particle is obtained and discussed.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nFew years ago we were considering [1\u20134] a motion of a wave packet (WP) representing a fermion\nin a spherical symmetric potential (e.g. the nonrelativistic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator \u2013 3dHO) with a spin orbit coupling. We have discovered a phenomenon called spin-orbit\npendulum, in which the spin of the particle, initially polarized along a well-defined direction\nmakes a reversible transition to a state in which no direction is preferred. In other words, one\ncan observe a reversible transfer of the angular momentum between the spin and orbital motion.\nThis behavior is very similar to revivals of population inversions within the Jaynes-Cummings\nmodel.\nWe would like to present the relativistic version of the spin-orbit pendulum using the Dirac\noscillator [5\u20139] instead of the 3dHO. The mechanism of spin collapses and revivals remains\nthe same, but we have found several new effects caused by the relativistic regime: broken\nperiodicity, the Zitterbewegung of spin mean values and the appearence of the WP components,\nthat are made of negative energy states and can be interpreted within the hole theory.\n\u2217\n\nResearch partially supported by KBN grant No. 5 P03B 010 20 and Technical University of Zielona G\u00f3ra\n\n1\n\n\fIn contrast to the work [13], where the WP motion corresponding to circular orbits has\nbeen presented for DO, we discuss here initial conditions leading to a different topology of the\norbital motion, i.e. linear orbits and then compare results with that of circular ones. Results\npresented in [13] and in the present paper are the first ones on 3d wavepacket dynamics in DO.\nThe results presented in [16, 17] correspond to the relativistic 1+1 dimensional case of Dirac\noscillator.\n\n2\n\nThe Dirac Oscillator\n\nA system called by Moshinsky and Szczepaniak [9, 10] the Dirac oscillator (DO) had been\nconsidered several times in the past [5\u20138] in different contexts. Therefore here we only recall\nthe most important relations relevant for a construction of WP and its evolution. The DO is\ndescribed by the equation:\nih\u0304\n\n\u2202\u03a8\n= HDO \u03a8 = c [ \u03b1 * ( p \u2212 im\u03c9r\u03b2) + mc\u03b2] ,\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 are usual Dirac matrices. It was shown that both the large and small components\nof an DO eigenstate obey equations:\nh\n\n(E 2 \u2212 m2 c4 ) \u03a8l(s) = c2 (p2 + m\u03c9 2 r 2 ) \u2213 3h\u0304\u03c9mc2 \u2213\n\ni\n4mc2 \u03c9\nL * S \u03a8l(s) .\nh\u0304\n\n(2)\n\nExpression on the right side is, except an irrelevant constant, a three-dimensional harmonic\noscillator (3dHO) Hamiltonian with a very strong spin-orbit coupling term. Hence, both the\ncomponents must be of the form |Nljmj i. The energy spectrum is given by\nEN lj = \u00b1 mc\nwhere\nAN lj =\n\n\u001a\n\n2\n\nq\n\n1 + rAN lj ,\n\n2(N \u2212 j) + 1\n2(N + j) + 3\n\nr=\n\nh\u0304\u03c9\n,\nmc2\n\n(3)\n\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\n(4)\n\nfor j = l +\nfor j = l \u2212\n\nThe parameter r enables, if it is small enough, a transition to the nonrelativistic limit \u2013 quantity E \u2212 mc2 gets nearly equal to the energy spectrum of the nonrelativistic 3dHO with LS\ncoupling.

An exact Foldy-Wouthuysen (FW) tranformation [11] for\nDO is also known [12]. In this representation states with negative energy disappear, which\nmakes calculations much easier. The spectrum is the same as in the case of Dirac representation (3).\n\n3\n\nInitial form of the WP\n\nWe study the evolution of a Gaussian-shape WP which is initially centered at r0 and has the\naverage momentum p0 (i.e. a 3dHO coherent state). Moreover, the initial WP is an eigenstate\nof the spin pointed at some arbitrary direction defined by \u03b1 and \u03b2, which without loosing of\nthe generality could be chosen as real numbers\n\u03b1\n\uf8f7\n1\np0 * r \uf8ec\n(r \u2212 r0 )2\n\uf8ec\u03b2\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 ,\n\uf8ec\n\u03a8(r, t = 0) =\n+\ni\nexp\n3\n3\n\uf8ed0\uf8f8\n2\u03c3 2\nh\u0304\n(2\u03c0) 4 \u03c3 2\n0\n#\n\n\"\n\nwhere \u03c3 =\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(8)\n\nq\n\nh\u0304/m\u03c9.\n\nIn the following we will present the behavior of two kinds of the WP (8) corresponding to\nthe particular choices of initial conditions:\n\u2022 The circular WP which is obtained by choosing\n\u221a\n\u221a\nr0 = x0 x\u0302 = \u03c3 N x\u0302\np0 = p0 \u0177 = \u03c3 \u22121 N \u0177 .\n\n(9)\n\nSuch WPs have already been considered in our previous papers for nonrelativistic HO [1,4]\nand relativistic DO [13].\n\u2022 The linear WP defined by the following choise\nr0 = z0 \u1e91\n\np0 = p0 \u1e91 .\n\n(10)\n\nMotion of linear WPs for nonrelativistic HO have been discussed in [14, 15].\nSymbols x\u0302, \u0177, \u1e91 denote unit vectors along the relevant axis. The words circular and linear\nare used to emphasize different shapes of trajectories of considered coherent states. In a pure\nHO case such WPs move along circular and linear classical trajectories, respectively, without\nspreading.\n\n3\n\n\f4\n\nScheme of calculations\n\nThe circular WP at t = 0 could be written in the basis of 3dHO eigenstates;\n\u03b1\n\u221e\n\uf8ec\u03b2\uf8f7\nX\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n=\n\u03bbl |l, l, li \uf8ec \uf8f7 ,\n\uf8ed0\uf8f8\nl=0\n0\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03a8cir\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(11)\n\nwhere decomposition coeficients are given by:\nN l/2\n\u03bbl = (\u22121) exp (\u2212N/2) \u221a .\nl!\nl\n\n(12)\n\nNote, that this expression involves states with N = l = m only, taken with Poissonian weights.\nThe initial form of the linear WP is more complex\n\n\u03a8lin\n\n\u03b1\n\u221e X\nN\n\uf8ec\u03b2 \uf8f7\nX\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n=\n\u03bbN l |N, l, 0i \uf8ec \uf8f7 .\n\uf8ed0\uf8f8\nN l=0(1)\n0\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(13)\n\nIntroducing a complex parameter\n\uf8eb\nr\n\n1\nm\u03c9\nz0 + i\n\u03b6=\u221a \uf8ed\nh\u0304\n2\n\ns\n\n\uf8f6\n\nh\u0304\np0 \uf8f8\nm\u03c9\n\n(14)\n\nwe can write these coefficients as\n\u03bbN l =\n\nv\nu\nu\njt\n(\u22121)\n\n\u2212|\u03b6|2 N\nl!

Next step is to obtain an explicit form of the WP at an arbitrary time instant.

Hence, the vector of spin averages consists of two parts. Both of\nthem lie in the xOz plane. One is a constant vector which inclination angle \u03b81 with respect to\nthe Oz axis is given by:\n2\u03b1\u03b2\ntan \u03b81 = 2\n[ (l + 1)2 + l2 ] .\n(31)\n\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b22\n6\n\n\fThe second part of the spin vector oscillates with the period 2\u03c0/\u03c9N l . The average values of\nangular momentum behave in a similar way:\nhLx it = \u03b1\u03b2\n\n2l(l + 1)\n[ 1 \u2212 cos(\u03c9N l t) ]\n(2l + 1)2\n\nhLy it = 0\n\n(32)\n\nhLz it = (\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )\n\n2l(l + 1)\n[ 1 \u2212 cos(\u03c9N l t) ] ,\n(2l + 1)2\n\nIt is easy to check that the mean value of the total angular momentum hJi = hL + 1/2 \u03c3i is\nconserved during evolution:\nhJx it = \u03b1\u03b2\nhJy it = 0\nhJz it = (\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )/2\nand that the length of this vector is\nL = 0.\n\n6\n\nqP\n3\n\n2\ni=1 hJi it =\n\nq\n\n1\n(\u03b12\n4\n\n(33)\n\n+ \u03b2 2 )2 = 12 , because for linear WP\n\nAutocorrelation function and spin averages\n\nAn autocorrelation function at given time instant t is usualy defined as the projection of the\nWP |\u03a8(t)i onto the initial WP, that is\nA(t) = h\u03a8(0)|\u03a8(t)i .\n\n(34)\n\nHence, the autocorrelation function (or rather square of its modulus, which is a real quantity) is\na widely used tool for illustrating recurrences in WP's behavior. As 0 \u2264 |A(t)|2 \u2264 1, the value\nof |A(t)|2 indicates the degree of restoration of the initial shape and position of the WP.

Conventionally, the circular\norbit lies in xOy plane. For r = 0.0001 (left part) the behavior of h\u03c3i i resembles that obtained in\nthe nonrelativistic description (figs. 1 and 2 of [1]). A rapid collapse combined with a precession\nof the spin vector (defined by average values of spin operators) is observed. At time instants\ntn = (n/2)T , where T = 2\u03c0/\u03c9 is a classical period of the 3dHO, there are spin revivals. Due to\nthe quasiperiodicity of the evolution in relativistic case (nonlinear spectrum) it is hard to say if\nthe spin restores with an opposite sign for n odd, as it happens in nonrelativistic case. For the\ncase r = 0.0001 (weakly relativistic) the effect of Zitterbewegung is only slightly manifesting in\nh\u03c3z i. This phenomenon is much better pronounced in the strongly relativistic case with r = 0.5\n(central picture). In this case all components oscillate more rapidly due to the interference\namong states with negative and positive energies. The Zitterbewegung is removed in the FW\nrepresentation (right part). One can notice the fast decrease in the amplitudes of revivals for\nbigger value of r.\nFig. 2 shows the short time evolution of spin averages for the linear WP in Dirac representation (compare these results with nonrelativistic case in fig. 4 of [2]). Note, that there is no\nprecession, one observe spin collapses and revivals only. The transition from the pure state of\nthe spin in a well-defined direction n to the mixed state is especially clear in the case of the\nspin lying initially in the xOy plane (\u03b8\u03c3 = \u03c0/2). There is a noticeable Zitterbewegung for the\nlarger value of r \u2013 once again it disappears in the FW representation. The amplitude of this\ntrembling motion changes with increasing angle between Oz axis and the initial spin direction,\nwith the maximum for \u03b8\u03c3 = \u03c0/2.\nRelativistic effects, like the Zitterbewegung and an increase of the revival time with respect\nto the HO period T grow also with increasing z0 and consequently with the mean energy of the\nwave packet. It is well seen in Fig. 3 that for small z0 (small WP energy) the motion is almost\nperiodic with time scale very close to the HO period, while for higher energies deviations from\nthe HO period and imperfections of revivals become substantial.\n\n9\n\n\f7\n\nLong time behavior\n\nWe found the existence of fractional revivals during the long time evolution of the considered\nsystem. Using the prescription given by Averbukh and Perelman [18] we have estimated the\nrevival time (of the second order) as Trev \u2248 T /r for small values of r. According to Averbukh\nand Perelman's scenario the first full revival is expected at time (1/2)Trev preceded by a series\nof fractional revivals. Fig. 4 illustrates such revivals for the circular WP as well as for the\nlinear one. For circular WP the standard fractional revivals at t/T = 1/8, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 are\nwell pronounced. For linear WP, due to different topology and the existence of boundary\nconditions [19, 20] we see spin collapses at t/T = 1/8 and 1/4 and fractional revivals only at\nt/T = 1/3 and 1/2.\n\n8\n\nProbability densities\n\nInitial stages of the evolution of the highly relativistic (r = 0.5) circular WP are presented in the\nFig. 5 in spherical coordinates \u03b8 and \u03c6. The probability density on the sphere with the radius\ncorresponding to the radius of the classical orbit is displayed. The case presented in the figure\ncorresponds to the initial direction of the spin parallel to Ox axis. In both representations a\nlarge part of the WP does not move at all because angular velocities originated from orbital and\nspin motion cancel in DO [13]. There are also two smaller subpackets which rotate in opposite\ndirections with the same absolute value of the angular velocity. These subpackets don't spread\nduring their evolution and move close to the classical trajectory (|r| = x0 and \u03b8 = \u03c0/2). The\nsmaller one consists mainly of states with negative energy eigenvalues. This part of the WP\ndisappears (the corresponding part of the probability density is shifted to the bigger one) in\nthe FW representation.\nFigures 6 and 7 display the evolution of linear wave packets starting from the center of the\ncoordinate system and from a turning point, respectively. The initial Gaussian WP transforms\ninto spreading rings (case of the spin along Oz axis, i.e. along the orbit) that move along the\nclassical trajectory. The details of this type of motion have been described (for nonrelativistic\ncase) in [14, 15, 19]. Particularly interesting is a kind of squeezing of the WP starting from\nthe turning point when it reaches the center of the potential at t = (1/4)T . For other spin\ndirections rings become crescents (see Fig. 8) because cylindrical symmetry is absent in the\ninitial conditions. For longer evolution (not shown) one sees that the linear WP starting from\none turning point does not reach the other. Instead, the WP is squeezed near the center of the\ncoordinate system and turned back. This unusual behavior is caused by the extremely strong\nspin-orbit coupling in the DO.\nAs in the previous case of the circular WP one may observe, if the value of r is big enough, two\nsubpackets travelling in opposite directions. One of them is removed in the FW representation.\nThis behavior is well illustrated in Fig. 9.\n\nReferences\n10\n\n\f[1] R. Arvieu and P. Rozmej, Phys. Rev. A 50, (1994) 4376.\n[2] R. Arvieu and P.

Two cases of r values are presented (r = 0.0001\nand r = 0.01), h\u03c3n i is an average value of the spin projection on the initial spin direction.\n\nFigure 3: Comparison of the spin averages short time evolution for different initial positions\nof the linear WP with r=0.01. Results for Dirac (left) and FW (right) representations are\npresented.\n\nFigure 4: Spin revivals in the long time evolution of the circular (top) and the linear (bottom)\nWP in a weakly relativistic case.\n\nFigure 5: Initial stages of the evolution of the circular WP (N = 20, r = 0.5) in Dirac and FW\nrepresentations. Angular coordinates \u03b8 and \u03c6 are used to present the cross-sections of \u03a8\u2020 \u03a8\nwith the sphere |r| = z0 .\n\nFigure 6: Evolution of the linear WP starting from the center of the coordinate system\n(z0 = 0). \u03a8\u2020 \u03a8 in the xOz plane (containing the classical trajectory) is presented. Remember\nthat there is a cylindrical symmetry with respect to Oz axis.\n\nFigure 7:\n(p0 = 0).\n\nThe same as in the Fig. 6. but for the WP starting from the turning point z0\n\nFigure 8: Cross-sections of the linear WP with the planes perpendicular to the classical\ntrajectory. The axial symmetry is lost if the initial spin direction is not along the Oz axis.\n\nFigure 9: Comparison of the evolution of the strongly relativistic linear WP (r=0.5) in Dirac\nand FW representations.\n\n12\n\n\fr=0.0001 N=20 Dirac rep.\n\nr=0.5 N=20 Dirac rep.\n\n1\n\nr=\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n1\n\n0\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-1\n1\n\n-1\n1\n\n-1\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-1\n1\n\n-1\n0.1\n\n2\n\n\u03a3i < \u03c3i >\n0\n1\n< \u03c3x >\n\n< \u03c3y >\n0\n-1\n0.1\n\n< \u03c3z >\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\nt/T\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\nt/T\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n0\n\n2\n\n\f1\n\u03b8\u03c3 = 0\n\nr=0.0001 zo=500\n\n\u03a3 < \u03c3 i >2\n\n\u03b8\u03c3 = \u03c0 / 4\n\u03b8\u03c3 = \u03c0 / 2\n\n0.5\n\nr=0.01 zo=50\n0.5\n\n0\n1\n\n0\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n< \u03c3n >\n\n< \u03c3n >\n\n\u03a3 < \u03c3 i >2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\nclose to nonrelativistic limit\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nrelativistic case\n\n-1\n0.5\nt/T\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0\nt/\n\n\f1\n\n0.75\n\n0.75\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.25\n\n0.25\n\n< \u03c3z >\n\n< \u03c3z >\n\n1\n\n0\n-0.25\n\nDirac representation\n\n-0.75\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n-0.25\n\nzo = 70\nzo = 50\nzo = 30\nzo = 15\n\nr=0.01 \u03b1=1 \u03b2=0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.6\n\nt/T\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\nr=0.01 \u03b1=1 \u03b2=0\n\n-0.5\n\nF-W representation\n\n-0.75\n1.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nt/\n\n\fThis figure \"f4.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/quant-ph/0105021v1\n\n\fThis figure \"f5.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/quant-ph/0105021v1\n\n\fThis figure \"f6.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/quant-ph/0105021v1\n\n\fThis figure \"f7.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/quant-ph/0105021v1\n\n\fThis figure \"f8.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/quant-ph/0105021v1\n\n\fThis figure \"f9.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/quant-ph/0105021v1\n\n\f"}
