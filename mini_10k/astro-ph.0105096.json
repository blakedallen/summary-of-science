Following\nthis work, several others have applied this technique to\nvarious samples (Smail et al. 2000; Barger et al. 2000).\nThe former make use of a complete sample of 850 \u03bcm observations. This method has been used by several authors\nto obtain the redshift distribution of galaxies detected in\nthe submm wavelengths (Smail et al. 2000; Barger et al.\n1999; Bertoldi et al. 2000; Ivison et al. 2000). The basis\nfor this method is the tight correlation between the far\ninfrared (FIR) flux in a broad band of 40\u2013120 \u03bcm (defined through the FIR parameter by Helou et al. 1988)\nand the radio continuum flux density (FD) at cm wavelengths (Condon 1992 and references therein). CY have\ndiscussed extensively the advantages of using these wavelengths. The steep nature of the submm SED and the\nfact that as the redshift increases, the FD at the rest system submm wavelength increases sharply, while the corresponding radio FD decreases give rise to a fast change\n\nin the FD ratio with z. The accuracy of the method depends on the extent of the variation of SED from galaxy\nto galaxy. Once the local value of the submm-to-radio\nratio, Rsr = S(353 GHz)/S(1.49 GHz), and the dust\nemission SED are known, the Rsr \u2013z behavior can be predicted.\nMost authors have used a modified blackbody spectrum with an emissivity dependence of \u01eb(\u03bd) \u221d \u03bd n with\nn = 1\u20131.5 and the Rsr value of nearby prototype galaxies, like M 82 or Arp 220, and other ultraluminous galaxies since a good sample of submm local galaxies was not\navailable. Blain (1999a) and Carilli and Yun (2000a) have\ndiscussed the uncertainties associated with this method.\nThough they treated some important issues of real SEDs,\nmany aspects are still overlooked and remain to be considered with regard to a large well-controlled sample of\ngalaxies.\nRecently, Dunne et al. (2000, hereafter DS-I) have published a catalog of 850 \u03bcm flux densities for a complete\nsample of 104 bright IRAS galaxies. This large sample\ncan profitably be used to compute the expected variation of Rsr with z. In their erratum (Carilli, Yun 2000b)\nCarilli and Yun have also commented on the Dunne et\n\n\f2\n\nT. N. Rengarajan & T. T. Takeuchi\n\nal. data. Therefore, we discuss this method further and\ncompare available observations for well-identified high-z\ngalaxies with our computed curve. We also estimate the\ndispersion in the relationship and discuss the limitations\nof the method. Finally, we briefly comment on other\nmethods proposed for a redshift determination, such as\nthose using the submm photometric ratio (Hughes et al.\n1998) and those locating the peak of the FIR emission\n(Blain 1999a, 1999b).\n2.\n\nData and Analysis\n\n2.1. Submillimeter Data\nDunne et al. (2000) tabulated the data for a complete\nsub-sample of IRAS galaxies selected from the Bright\nGalaxy Sample (Soifer et al. 1989). Besides other information, they tabulated the 850 \u03bcm flux densities measured using SCUBA and parameters of fits to the SED\nusing their data and the IRAS 60 and 100 \u03bcm FDs.\nThey assumed a modified blackbody spectrum characterized by dust temperature, Td and a dust emissivity index, n. Though these values may not correctly\nrepresent the physical temperature, they give a reasonable measure of the SED at wavelengths longer than\n60 \u03bcm. The mean and dispersion of Td and n are\n35.6\u00b14.9 K and 1.3 \u00b1 0.2, respectively. Using the parameter FIR = 1.26 \u00d7 10\u221214 \u00d7 [2.58 S(60) + S(100)] and\nH0 = 75 Mpc\u22121 km s\u22121 the computed FIR luminosity,\nLFIR , ranges from 1010 to 1012 L\u2299 . Radio-continuum\nFDs at 1.49 GHz are available for almost all DS-I sources\nfrom Condon et al. (1990, 1996). Using these along\nwith the DS-I 850 \u03bcm data, we find the mean and dispersion of log Rsr to be 0.43 and 0.24, respectively.\nFrom a more careful look at the data, it is seen that\nlogRsr is a decreasing function of LFIR , changing from\n0.55 in the log LFIR /L\u2299 interval 10\u201310.3 to 0.29 for the\n11.2\u201312 interval. This result arises mainly due to the\ncorrelation between (Td , n) and LFIR affecting the ratio\nS(353 GHz)/FIR. We discuss the effect of this later. If a\ngalaxy located at a redshift z is observed at frequencies\n\u03bdsobs and \u03bdrobs at the Earth where the subscripts s and\nr refer to submm and radio, respectively, the observed\nratio is related to the rest system ratio by the relation\nRsr =\n\nS[(1 + z)\u03bdsem ]\nS(\u03bdsobs )\n=\n.\nS(\u03bdrobs )\nS[(1 + z)\u03bdrem ]\n\n(1)\n\nIf the radio SED is a power law of the form, S(\u03bdr ) \u221d \u03bdr\u03b1 ,\nthe denominator can be replaced by (1 + z)\u03b1 S(\u03bdrem ). For\na subsequent discussion, we take \u03bds = 353 GHz and\n\u03bdr = 1.49 GHz. For each source of DS-I, we compute\nS[353(1 + z)] using the fitted values of Td and n for that\nsource and take the ratio to the observed 1.49 GHz FD.\nThe mean and dispersion of the ratio are then computed\nas a function of redshift. What about the effect of a\n\n[Vol. ,\n\nluminosity\u2013Rsr correlation? Though the submm-radio\nratio for the local sample decreases by \u223c 0.25 dex in the\nlog LFIR range 10\u201312, the effect is diluted as z increases,\nsince one samples wavelengths closer to 100 \u03bcm the corresponding decrease at redshifts of 1, 3, and 5 are only\n0.15, 0.07, and 0.05, respectively, much less than the dispersions. These decreases are somewhat less than what\none may expect from the SED variation as a function\nof FIR luminosity, since they are compensated by a decrease in radio emission due to self absorption for highluminosity sources. We consider this effect in greater\ndetail while discussing the radio spectral index. It is\nwell known that the apparent 850 \u03bcm brightness of a\nsource of given luminosity decreases slowly because the\nslope of the dust emission SED compensates for the distance (Blain, Longair, 1996). For a detection sensitivity\nof 5 mJy at 850 \u03bcm, the threshold value of log LFIR /L\u2299\nincreases from 11.7 to 12 in the redshift interval 0.5\u20136\n[assuming the average observed ratio of S(353 GHz)/FIR\nand using q0 = 0.5]. On the other hand, for a given detection sensitivity of the radio continuum emission, the\nthreshold FIR luminosity increases faster. For example,\ntaking the detection sensitivity at 1.49 GHz to be 10 \u03bcJy,\nwe find that the calculated threshold luminosity based\non the well known FIR-radio correlation changes from\nlog LFIR /L\u2299 = 10.4 at z = 0.5 to 12.5 at z = 5. If\nwe require detection at both 850 \u03bcm and 1.49 GHz, the\nhigher of the above defines the threshold luminosity. Assuming the effective range of luminosity to be from the\nthreshold to 0.5 dex higher, the relevant logarithmic luminosity intervals for the range z = 0.5\u20133 and 3\u20136 are\nabout 12\u201312.5 L\u2299 and 12.5\u201313 L\u2299 respectively. From\nthe data of DS-I, we find that the mean dust temperature in the log LFIR /L\u2299 interval of 11.2\u201312 is 39.5 K.\nBased on the observed Td \u2013LFIR correlation, the extrapolated temperatures are 42.4 and 44.6 K for the two luminosity intervals above 12. We, then, compute corrections\nto the S[353(1 + z) GHz]/S(1.49 GHz) ratio based on the\nchanges in the ratios of S[353(1 + z)]/FIR computed using the temperatures for the relevant luminosity interval\nand an emissivity index of 1.3. It may be noted that\nthe application of the correction for the radio continuum\nSED transforms the above ratio to Rsr , the rest system\nsubmm-to-radio continuum FD ratio. The corrected values are lower compared to the values determined from\nthe DS-I data for the 11.2\u201312 interval. The corrections\nare 0.23, 0.2, and 0.15 dex at z = 0.5, 3, and 6, respectively. It may be noted that the correction decreases for\nlarger z because one is sampling wavelengths closer to\n100 \u03bcm.\n2.2.\n\nRadio Spectral Index\n\nIn order to compute the expected radio continuum\nemission at frequencies higher than 1.49 GHz we need\n\n\fNo. ]\n\nRadio-to-Submillimeter Flux Density Ratio as a Measure of Redshift\n\na knowledge of both the FD at z \u2248 0 and the radio spectral index. CY assumed a spectral index of \u22120.8. In\norder to take into account the self absorption at frequencies close to 1.49 GHz, Barger et al. (2000) estimated the\nFD at 1.49 GHz by extrapolating the observed FD for\nArp 220 at a high frequency of 8.4 GHz using a spectral\nindex of \u22120.8 and using the same index for computing\nFD at intermediate frequencies. It is true that the observed 1.49 GHz FD is reduced due to self-absorption effect, especially for luminous sources, thus increasing the\nvalue of Rsr . However, it should be noted that when a\ndistant source is observed, what we measure is not the\nintrinsic flux, but the emergent flux including the effect\nof self absorption. Therefore, it is more appropriate to\nuse the observed 1.49 GHz values and make a correction\nto the expected behavior while computing the submm\u2013\nradio spectral index as a function of z. Using the available radio data (1.49 GHz: Condon et al. 1990; 4.85 GHz:\nCondon & Broderick, 1991; Condon et al. 1995), we find\nthe mean and dispersion of the 4.85\u20131.49 GHz spectral\nindex for the available DS-I sources to be \u22120.65 and 0.26\nrespectively. For 21 DS-I sources for which 8.44 GHz\ndata are available (Condon et al. 1991) the 1.49\u20138.44 GHz\nspectral index is \u22120.47. These galaxies have log LFIR /L\u2299\ngreater than 11. Stine (1992) finds, for a sample of 23\nMarkarian galaxies, the 1.4\u20135 GHz spectral index to be\n\u22120.64. From these data it is clear that the absorption\neffect at low frequencies is present. Condon et al. (1991)\nobserved a sample of 40 ultraluminous infrared galaxies,\nand found that the FIR-to-1.49 GHz radio continuum\nratio for luminous (log LFIR /L\u2299 > 11.4) sources containing compact radio cores is 0.25 dex higher than that for\nthe rest of the galaxies, which have the standard ratio.\nWhen they correct for the self absorption at 1.49 GHz using the 8.44 GHz FD and assuming the real radio spectral\nindex to be \u22120.7, the corrected mean ratio is normal. If\nwe assume that the self absorption effect is confined to\n\u03bd < 5 GHz, the spectral index in the 1.49\u20135 GHz range\nis then \u2248 \u22120.3. In the DS-I data we also find the effect\nof self absorption in the FIR to radio continuum ratio.\nThe 4.7\u20131.4 GHz spectral index of Arp 220 (Anantharamaiah et al. 2000) is \u22120.3. Taking all the above into\naccount, a reasonable approximation for the radio spectral index would be \u22120.4 in the 1.49\u20135 GHz range and\n\u22120.7 for frequencies higher than 5 GHz and to scale FDs\nfrom the value at 1.49 GHz. Using this approximation\nand the method enumerated earlier for computing the\nS[353(1 + z) GHz]/S(1.49 GHz) ratio, we calculate Rsr\nas a function of z using equation 1.\n2.3.\n\nRelationship between Redshift and Submm-Radio\nFlux Ratio\n\nThe 353\u20131.49 GHz spectral index computed from this\nis shown in figure 1 as a solid line. For estimating the dis-\n\n3\n\nFig. 1 - The 353 GHz-to-1.49 GHz spectral index, \u03b3,\nplotted as a function of galaxy redshift, z.

The dispersion of the spectral index is between 0.1 and 0.11. The\nupper and lower envelopes are shown as dashed lines in\nfigure 1. Our values of the ratio S[353(1 + z)]/S(1.49)\nagree within 0.1 dex with those obtained by Barger et\nal. (2000) based on the SED and FD of Arp 220; for\nz < 1, our values are lower and for higher z, larger. However, after the application of radio spectral index effects,\nour 353\u20131.49 spectral index values are about 0.05 lower\nthroughout. At z \u2248 0, our index is higher reflecting the\nfree\u2013free absorption effect. It may be noted that our result is not based on a single prototype, but on the data\nof over 20 galaxies with log LFIR /L\u2299 > 11.2.\n3.\n3.1.\n\nDiscussion\nComparison with Observations\n\nIn figure 1 we also show the data points of individual high-z sources compiled from available publications. We have included only well-identified sources\nthat have definite redshift measurements from the nearinfrared or CO spectral lines. The objects with the values of redshift in parentheses and references to them are:\nIRAS F10214+0724 (2.29) (Rowan-Robinson et al. 1993);\nHR 10 (1.44) (Cimatti et al. 1998; Dey et al. 1999);\nCFRS 14F (0.66) (Lilly et al. 1999); BR 1202 \u2212 0725\n\n\f4\n\nT. N. Rengarajan & T. T. Takeuchi\n\n(4.69) (Isaak et al. 1994); SMM J14011 + 0252 (2.55)\n(Ivison et al. 2000); SMM J02399 \u2212 0136 (2.8) (Ivison et\nal. 1998); APM 08279 + 5225 (3.87) (Lewis et al. 1998);\nSMM J21536 + 1741 (0.23), SMM J14010 + 0252 (0.25) (\nEdge et al. 1999); SMM J14010 + 0253 (2.22) (Ivison et\nal. 2000); LBQS 1230 \u2212 1627B (2.7), BRI 1335 \u2212 0417\n(4.4), BRI 0952 \u2212 0115 (4.43) (Yun et al.\n2000).\nWe have included CFRS 14F, since Lilly et al. (1999)\nconsider it to be their most secure identification and\nSMM J14010 + 0253 based on the spectral line identification of Ivison et al. (2000). The 1.4 GHz FD for\nCFRS 14F has been extrapolated from the 5 GHz FD\nassuming a spectral index of \u22120.7. For HR 10, we have\nused the FDs listed by Dey et al. (1999); the 1.4 GHz FD\nhas been extrapolated from the 3.6 cm measurement. It\nmay be noted that for the three dusty QSOs of Yun et al.\n(2000) the index is an extrapolation from the 240 GHz\nmeasurement assuming a 350\u2013250 GHz spectral index of\n\u22123.5. For their fourth source, BR 1202 \u2212 0725, we used\nthe 350 GHz flux density measured by Isaak et al. (1994).\nThe two Edge et al. (1999) sources are cD galaxies in the\ncenters of rich clusters of galaxies, A 1835 and A 2390.\nThe curve shown in figure 1 is representative of the\nmean for a sample of galaxies at different redshifts. Individual galaxies may deviate from the curve. An inspection of figure 1 shows that the observed data points\npopulate the region delineated by our calculations. The\nexceptions are the two cD galaxies and the dusty QSO,\nBRI 0952 \u2212 0115, which are well below the predicted\nrange. These sources must be dominated by AGN radio\nemission. It is interesting that for this sample of wellidentified sources, there is none occurring above the predicted error zone. We also note that the AGN-dominated\nsources seem to be clearly separated from the starburst\ngalaxies.\nWhat are the types of sources that may populate regions above the predicted zone? The submm SED may be\nsignificantly affected by the presence of cold dust. From\nISO observations of a sample of 'active' and 'inactive'\ngalaxies covering a luminosity range of log LFIR /L\u2299 =\n10\u201311.2, Siebenmorgen, Kr\u00fcgel and Chini (1999) conclude that while the SED of the former sample is well\nfitted by a modified blackbody spectrum with a single\ntemperature of \u223c 30\u201332 K, the latter 'inactive' sample\nrequires the presence of an additional colder component\n(T = 11\u201316 K). These galaxies have a higher submm-toFIR flux ratio, and will yield a 353 GHz\u20131.4 GHz index\nhigher by up to 0.3 as compared to our calculation. From\nan analysis of their data, we find that the redshift estimate will be most affected at wavelengths close to 850 \u03bcm\n(z < 1\u20131.5) for such galaxies. Such effects may explain\nthe discrepancy between the redshift estimates using the\nsubmm\u2013FIR photometric ratio and the submm-radio index for FIRBACK sources of Scott et al. (2000). 'Inactive' galaxies with cold dust may be a significant fraction\n\n[Vol. ,\n\nof the low-z population, and hence an estimate of the\nredshift from the submm\u2013radio index could distort the\npicture of the star-formation rate at low redshifts. On the\nother hand, it is unlikely that such sources are present\nat high redshifts, since we do not expect very luminous\n'inactive' galaxies.\nIt is of interest to see what is the median redshift of\nthe complete Smail et al. (2000) sample of galaxies. If we\nuse the spectroscopic redshifts for 5 galaxies with reliable\nidentification and estimate the redshift for the remaining\n11 galaxies from our submm\u2013radio index curve, we find\nthe median redshift to be \u223c 2.1. In the above, if the\nestimate is a lower limit, the source is assumed to be at\nthat redshift value. If, on the other hand, we use only\nthe estimated redshift from the submm-radio index and\nexclude the two cD galaxies, the median redshift is \u223c 2.2.\nThese values are similar to those deduced by Smail et al.\n(2000) within the error of \u2206z \u223c 1 at these redshifts.\nWhat are the systematic effects one would expect at\nhigher redshifts? As remarked earlier, higher z sources\nend to be more luminous, have a steeper FIR\u2013submm\nSED, and hence, lower 353\u20131.49 GHz spectral index. If\nsources with high temperature (T > 50 K with n = 1.3)\nare present, they would populate regions lower than the\npredicted curve. However, there are other effects which\nmay compensate this. If the free\u2013free absorption is high,\nthe radio continuum FD, even at higher frequencies,\ncould be lower, thus increasing the observed 353\u20131.49\nGHz index. Another effect could arise if the emission at\n100 \u03bcm is optically thick. Solomon et al. (1997), who\nobserved a sample of very high luminosity sources out to\nredshift of 0.3 in the CO line, conclude that \u03c4100 is high\nfor these sources. If the 100 \u03bcm optical depth is large,\nsay \u2248 1, the emission can still be optically thin at submm\nwavelengths, thus increasing the submm\u2013FIR ratio. For\nan SED characterized by an emissivity index, n = 1, and\ntemperature range of 45\u201355 K, the change in the logarithmic ratio of S(\u03bd)/FIR for the cases \u03c4100 = 1 and\n\u03c4100 \u226a 1 are increases of 0.17 to 0.24 as the wavelength\nchanges from 200 to 600 \u03bcm. These are about the same\nas the decrease in the individual ratio for \u03c4100 \u226a 1 while\nthe temperature changes from 45 to 55 K. The presence\nof an AGN core would also depress the observed ratio.\nThis aspect has been discussed in detail by CY.\n3.2.\n\nAccuracy of Redshift Estimate\n\nIf we want to estimate the redshift from the value of\nthe ratio of submm-to-radio continuum FDs, the uncertainty in redshift is given by the intersection of a\nhorizontal line at that value with the dispersion envelopes shown in figure 1. We, then, find the uncertainties in the redshift estimate at z = 1, 2, 3, 4, and\n5 to be \u00b10.33, (+0.7, \u22120.5), (+0.9, \u22120.8), (+1.1, \u22121), and\n\u00b11.2, respectively. These uncertainties do not include the\n\n\fNo. ]\n\nRadio-to-Submillimeter Flux Density Ratio as a Measure of Redshift\n\nsystematic effects discussed in the previous section. At\n< 2, the redshift estimate would be reasonably accurate.\nz\u223c\nHowever, the changes in SED of the source affect the result more than in the high-z region, since the sampled\nwavelengths are closer to 850 \u03bcm. If there is a cold dust\ncomponent present, the observed spectral index would be\nhigher than the predicted value, and less if the temperature is high. The effects of the SED variation are less for\nhigh z, but the flattening gradient gives rise to larger errors. An additional problem is the effect of the large \u03c4100\n> 3,\nif the sources are very luminous and compact. At z \u223c\nthe lower limit is perhaps the best result. For z > 7,\nthe sensitivity of the technique would be very poor, since\nthe sampled wavelengths are in the flat peak region of\nthe SED. In summary, the 353\u20131.49 GHz ratio can lead\nto a crude estimate of a redshift and reasonable lower\nlimits. Hence at present, the study of the distribution\nof redshifts from just this ratio is premature. The situation will perhaps improve once a larger sample of wellidentified galaxies is available and with better knowledge\nof the systematic effects.\n3.3. Photometric Redshift\nHughes et al. (1998) have suggested that the redshift\ncan be estimated from the ratio of FDs in two or more\nsubmm bands. For this technique to work, at least one\n< 200 \u03bcm, away from\nrest system wavelength should be \u223c\nthe single power-law region. Scott et al. (2000) have also\nused the FIR-to-submm FD ratio for their FIRBACK\nsample. The uncertainties arising from variations in SED\nwill be similar to the submm\u2013radio index method. Unlike the latter method that uses only one rest wavelength\nsampling, the steep part of the SED, the requirement\nof measurements at two bands, at least one rest wavelength away from this steep region, reduces the sensitivity of the photometric method. For rest wavelengths\n> 1000 \u03bcm, significant contamination from the thermal\nfree\u2013free emission may be present. This method can be\na useful supplement to the submm\u2013radio index method,\nespecially for a redshift range of 1\u20133.\n3.4. Redshift from the Peak of SED\nBlain (1999a, 1999b) has suggested that the redshift\ncould be estimated by locating the peak of the dust emission SED. This technique works if all sources are characterized by a constant temperature. Uncertainty in redshift is directly proportional to the changes in the peak\nwavelength that depends on T , the emissivity index, and\nthe optical depth near the peak. Another factor affecting the redshift estimate is the accuracy with which peak\nfrequency can be located. Apart from the observational\nconstraints arising from the availability of suitable bands\nfor measurement, uncertainty is also introduced by the\nflatness of the SED in the peak region. We estimate that\n\n5\n\nthe resulting error in z is \u223c 0.3 at z = 1 and \u223c 0.9\nat z = 5. The uncertainty in SED parameters would\nfurther increase the errors. If multiband photometry on\nboth sides of the peak are available, a template SED can\nbe fitted to get better accuracy.\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have re-examined the method for estimating the\nredshifts of galaxies using the submm\u2013radio spectral index. For this purpose, we made use of the properties of\nthe 850 \u03bcm sample of galaxies observed by Dunne et al.\n(2000). We compute the variation of the 350\u20131.4 GHz\nspectral index as a function of z taking into account the\neffects of luminosity on the SED and free\u2013free absorption effects on the radio emission. We find that all wellidentified sources have their spectral indices either within\nthe error zone, or much lower. The latter, presumably\nradio-loud AGNs, are well separated from the rest. We\nalso find the median redshift to be \u223c 2, which is consistent with that deduced by Smail et al. (2000) within an\nerror of \u2206z \u223c 1 at these redshifts.\nTNR thanks the Japan Society for the Promotion of\nScience for the award of an Invitation Fellowship and Dr.\nHiroshi Shibai for his hospitality.\nReferences\nAnantharamaiah, K.
