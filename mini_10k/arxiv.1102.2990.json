All superconductors with a\ntransition temperature Tc > 30 K have a layered structure. In particular, the superconducting gap of cuprates\nwas found to be strongly anisotropic due to the crystal\nstructure consisting of weakly coupled superconducting\nCuO2 planes.10 It is interesting to investigate how the\nanisotropic properties change as a function of thermodynamic parameters and doping within a particular family\nof cuprates, and to explore their common features by\ncomparing various families.\nThe gap structure can be probed directly by exciting superconducting carriers. Importantly, the energy\nneeded for this, i.e. the energy gap, may be accessed by\nprobing the magnetic penetration depth \u03bb.11 In a layered\nsuperconductor the gap structure is strongly anisotropic,\nthus \u03bb is anisotropic as well. The magnetic penetration\ndepth related to a supercurrent flowing along the i-axis\n(i = a, b, c) is denoted as \u03bbi , and the penetration depth\nanisotropy between two crystallographic directions i and\nj is \u03b3ij = \u03bbi /\u03bbj .\nIn the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory, which is\nthe most commonly applied phenomenological description of layered superconductors, the anisotropy is described by the temperature independent effective mass\n||j\n||i\nanisotropy (assuming \u03bbi /\u03bbj = (m\u2217i /m\u2217j )1/2 = Hc2 /Hc2 ,\n||k\n\nwhere Hc2 is the upper critical field along the k-axis).\nHowever, a temperature dependent anisotropy was observed in various superconductors, especially in the twogap superconductor MgB2 (see Refs. 7 and 12), and\nwas explained as a consequence of the presence of two\nsuperconducting gaps. A similar temperature dependence was also observed in iron-based superconductors,13\nin which evidence for two-band superconductivity was\n\nprovided by several experiments, including point contact spectroscopy14,15 and ARPES.16,17 Multi-gap superconductivity seems to be more common than first\nexpected, as indications of it were also observed in\ncuprates.18\u201320 It may be related to the temperature dependence of the anisotropy,21 as in the case of MgB2 7 and\nthe iron-based superconductors.13 However, there may\nbe other reasons for this temperature dependence: the\nanisotropy of the gap,11,22 the anisotropy of the Fermi\nsurface,23 or strong coupling.24 A temperature dependent anisotropy parameter was also observed in cuprates\n(see e.g. Refs. 9, 18, 25, and 26). This rises the question\nwhether the temperature dependence of the anisotropy is\na common property of all layered high-Tc superconductors, and how it is linked to the gap structure.\nA recent study of the cuprate superconductor\nSmBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212\u03b4 facing this question was limited to the\nunderdoped region only.9 It was shown that the temperature dependence of the anisotropy is more pronounced\nfor samples with lower oxygen content. Such samples\nare characterized by a well developed pseudogap, i.e. an\nadditional energy scale which may play a similar role in\nthe development of the temperature dependence of the\nanisotropy as the multi-gap structure in MgB2 and ironbased superconductors. Therefore, it is very important to\nperform reliable studies of the temperature dependence\nof the penetration depth anisotropy for optimally doped\nand overdoped cuprates. In this doping range the pseudogap vanishes or eventually overlaps with the superconducting gap.\nTaking all of the above into account, we decided to\nstudy the temperature dependence of the anisotropy of\na detwinned, almost fully oxygenated, overdoped single crystal of YBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212\u03b4 . This system exhibits an\nanisotropic energy gap,27 and several experiments indicate an order parameter of s+d wave symmetry.18,28\nHere, we report on torque measurements of the\nanisotropy parameter of an overdoped YBa2 Cu3 O7 single\ncrystal. Torque magnetometry provides a direct method\n\n\f2\nto study the anisotropic magnetic properties of superconductors, contrary to methods measuring physical quantities separately along different crystallographic directions from which the anisotropy parameter is determined.\nAn analytical approach for the analysis of experimental data based on the solution of the Hao-Clem29 functional is applied, which allows to investigate anisotropic\nextreme type-II superconductors beyond the London approximation. For simplicity, the London approximation\nof the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory (AGLT),30,31\nin which simplifications of the geometry of the vortex\nstructure are made, is often used for analyzing experimental data. However, as discussed by Hao and Clem29\nthis approximation may not necessarily be adapted to the\ninterpretation of magnetization measurements, and thus\nboth approaches are compared in this work.\nSection II gives a brief review of the London and of the\nHao-Clem models in connection with the torque magnetometry technique used in this work. The experimental\ndetails are described in Sec. III. The results and the discussion are presented in Sec. IV, followed by the conclusions in Sec. V.\n\nII.\n\nLONDON AND HAO-CLEM MODELS\n\n\u2212\n\u2192\nThe angular dependent magnetization M of a sample\n\u2212\nwith volume V and magnetic moment \u2192\nm is derived from\nthe free energy F of an anisotropic superconductor in the\nmixed state32\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2192\nm(\u03b8, H)\n1~\nM (\u03b8, H) =\n=\u2212 \u2207\nB F.\nV\nV\n\n(1)\n\nThe magnetic torque\n\u0010\n\u0011\n~ \u03b8 F = \u03bc0 V M\n~ \u00d7H\n~\n~\u03c4 = \u2212\u2207\n\n(2)\n\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2212\nis related to M and the angle \u03b8 between H and the crystallographic c-axis.\nA direct calculation of F within AGLT is not trivial,\nsince F depends on the exact distribution of vortices and\nthus on the local magnetic induction B(H) inside the\nsuperconductor. However, F can be expressed within\nthe so-called London limit, assuming that the influence\nof the finite vortex core size can be neglected. This is\nvalid if the vortex core size is very small compared to\nthe vortex itself, i.e. the penetration depth is much\nlarger than the coherence length. Anisotropic superconductors exhibit disctinct magnetic properties along the\nprincipal axes a, b, and c. In layered superconductors the\nlargest anisotropy is observed between the c-axis and the\nlayers (ab-plane). Therefore we may approximate the\northorhombic structure of YBa2 Cu3 O7 by a tetragonal\none,33 introducing the anisotropy parameter\n\u03b3=\n\n\u03bbc\n,\n\u03bbab\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\nthe in-plane magnetic penetration depth \u03bbab =\n\u221a\n\u03bba \u03bbb . The magnetization M and the torque \u03c4 are derived in the so-called Kogan model32 as\n!\n||c\n\u03b7Hc2\n\u03a60 \u000f(\u03b8)\nln\n(4)\nML (\u03b8, H) = \u2212\n8\u03c0\u03bc0 \u03bb2ab\n\u000f(\u03b8)H\nand\nV \u03a60 H\n\u03c4L (\u03b8, H) = \u2212\n16\u03c0\u03bb2ab\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\u2212 2\n\u03b3\n\n\u0013\n\nsin(2\u03b8)\n*\nln\n\u000f(\u03b8)\n\n||c\n\n\u03b7Hc2\n\u000f(\u03b8)H\n\n!\n.\n\n(5)\nHere, the index L indicates the London approach, \u03a60\nis the magnetic flux quantum, and \u000f(\u03b8) is the angular\nscaling function\nr\n1\n\u000f(\u03b8) = cos2 (\u03b8) + 2 sin2 (\u03b8).\n(6)\n\u03b3\nThe parameter \u03b7 accounts for uncertainties due to the approximation of the London limit (e.g. the neglected suppression of the order parameter inside the vortex cores).\nHao and Clem29 showed by analyzing the free energy\nwithin AGLT that the parameter \u03b7 cannot be constant in\nthe entire magnetic field range Hc1 < H < Hc2 , which is\nalso evident from more recent theoretical work34 beyond\nthe Hao-Clem model. The correct functional form of F\nby Hao and Clem29,35,36 incorporates in the expression\nfor M and \u03c4 the empirical functions \u03b1(h) and \u03b2(h), where\nh denotes the reduced field\nh(\u03b8) =\n\nH\n.\nHc2 (\u03b8)\n\n(7)\n\nTheir generalized treatment of the mixed state of a\nsuperconductor, which includes the vortex core contribution to the free energy functional, yields a more realistic\nformula for the magnetization29\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b2(h(\u03b8))\n\u03a60 \u000f(\u03b8)\n, (8)\nMHC (\u03b8, H) = \u2212\u03b1(h(\u03b8))\nln\n8\u03c0\u03bc0 \u03bb2ab\nh(\u03b8)\nwhere the index HC indicates the Hao-Clem model. According to Eq. (2), the torque is written as\n\u0013\n\u0012\nV \u03a60 H\n1\n\u03c4HC (\u03b8, H) = \u2212\u03b1(h(\u03b8))\n1\n\u2212\n(9)\n16\u03c0\u03bb2ab\n\u03b32\n\u0012\n\u0013\nsin(2\u03b8)\n\u03b2(h(\u03b8))\n*\nln\n.\n\u000f(\u03b8)\nh(\u03b8)\nHere, taking into account the suppression of the order parameter in the vortex core leads to a modification\nof Eqs. (4) and (5) by including the functions \u03b1(h) and\n\u03b2(h). These functions account for the correction of the\nin-plane magnetic penetration depth \u03bbab and the c-axis\n||c\nupper critical field Hc2 , respectively. For \u03b1(h) = 1 and\n\u03b2(h) = \u03b7, Eqs. (8) and (9) reduce to Eqs. (4) and (5)\nof the London limit. Within the HC treatment no analytical formulas for \u03b1(h) and \u03b2(h) can be derived easily.\n\n\f3\n0\n\nHowever, for a Ginzburg-Landau parameter \u03ba >> 1 the\nfollowing values for \u03b1 and \u03b2 are found29\n\n1.6\n1.4\n\n\u201310\n\n\u03b1\n\n1.2\n\nIt is clear that although \u03b1 and \u03b2 are assumed to be\nconstant in the London limit, they are field dependent\nand may vary considerably with magnetic field (\u03b1 and \u03b2\nare fully determined by the reduced field h).29\nIn Fig. 1 we present the numerically calculated field\ndependence of the reduced magnetization MHC (h)/Hc2\nand compare it with the empirical Eq. (8) in order to\nextract \u03b1(h) and \u03b2(h). The quantity \u03baMHC (h)/Hc2\nfor 2 < \u03ba < 200 is presented in Fig. 1a (for clarity,\n\u03baMHC (h)/Hc2 is shown instead of MHC (h)/Hc2 ). Obviously, MHC (h)/Hc2 strongly depends on \u03ba. The functions\n\u03b1(h) and \u03b2(h) are presented in panels b) and c), respectively. For \u03ba > 50, the functions \u03b1(h) and \u03b2(h) become\nessentially independent of \u03ba. The derived \u03b1(h) and \u03b2(h)\nare in good agreement with the values estimated by Hao\nand Clem29 given in Eq. (10).\nAnalyzing magnetic torque experiments by means of\nthe above described theoretical model by Hao and Clem,\none should note that the parameter \u03ba is the isotropic\nGinzburg-Landau parameter \u03ba = \u03bb/\u03be, where \u03be is the coherence length, and \u03bb is the magnetic penetration depth.\nHowever, for a layered superconductor, the GinzburgLandau parameter is anisotropic: \u03ba has to be replaced by\n\u03ba(\u03b8) = \u03bac /\u000f(\u03b8)2 , where \u03bac = \u03bbc /\u03bec = \u03b3 2 \u03bbab /\u03beab = \u03b3 2 \u03baab .\nThe functions \u03b1(h) and \u03b2(h) then depend on the angle \u03b8\nnot only via h(\u03b8), but also via \u03ba(\u03b8). For YBa2 Cu3 O7 in\na field of 1.4 T at T = 80 K, h(\u03b8) varies approximately\nbetween 0.1 (\u03b8 = 0\u00b0) and 0.01 (\u03b8 = 180\u00b0) when the field\nis turned from the c-axis to the ab-plane. In this case, \u03b1\nand \u03b2 strongly depend on h(\u03b8) (see Figs. 1b and c), but\nfor \u03ba(\u03b8) > 50 they are independent of \u03ba(\u03b8). Using the\nvalues for \u03bbab (T = 0) and \u03beab (T = 0) for YBa2 Cu3 O7\nfrom Refs. 37 and 38, one gets \u03baab ' 400, which means\nthat \u03ba(\u03b8) > 400 for all \u03b8. Thus, for YBa2 Cu3 O7 the parameter \u03ba(\u03b8) has negligible influence on \u03b1 and \u03b2. As a\nconsequence, taking into account the anisotropy on the\nGinzburg-Landau parameter \u03ba in the HC model does not\nlead to a more reliable determination of \u03b1 and \u03b2.\n\nIII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\n\nThe sample studied is an overdoped detwinned single crystal YBa2 Cu3 O7 grown in BaZrO3 crucibles, with\ndimensions 130\u00d7160\u00d750 \u03bcm3 and Tc ' 88 K. Crystal\ngrowth in BaZrO3 yields samples of highest purity.39 To\nfully oxygenate the crystal a high pressure annealing was\nperformed at 300 \u00b0C in 100 bar of oxygen. Samples\nproduced in this way show no anomalies, e.g. fishtail\neffect,40 and have very low pinning.41 A Quantum Design\nMPMS XL SQUID magnetometer was used to determine\n\n\u201320\n\n0\n\n\u201330\n\n2\n5\n10\n50\n100\n\n\u201350\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4 0.6\nh = H / Hc2\n\nb)\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nh\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.8\n\n\u03ba\n\n\u201340\n\n\u201360\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n1.4\n\n\u03b2\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\n\u03ba .

The temperature dependence of the magnetic\nmoment m was measured in a small field \u03bc0 H = 1 mT\nparallel to the ab-plane in zero field cooled (ZFC) and\nfield cooled (FC) mode. The small difference between\nm(T ) obtained in the two modes and the sharp transition observed indicate a good quality of the crystal.\nThe torque measurements were carried out using a\nhome-made torque magnetometer.6 The piezoresistive\nsensor used consists of a platform connected to piezoresistive legs which are bent when the sample mounted on\nthe platform undergoes a torque. The resulting resistance change in the piezoresistors is detected by a Wheatstone bridge. The read-out voltage is proportional to the\ntorque magnitude \u03c4 . The small dimensions needed for\nthe sample allow the study of high-quality single crystals.\n\nIV.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe torque measurements were performed in an external field of 1.4 T and 1 T in order to check for a possible field dependence of the anisotropy. Since the sample\nhas diamagnetic and anisotropic properties, its magne\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2212\ntization M is not quite aligned with the field H , which\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2212\nresults in a torque \u2192\n\u03c4 \u221d M \u00d7 \u03bc0 H according to Eq. (2).\nIn general, the torque signal is distorted by pinning effects: the vortex cores are pinned by defects in the sample, in which superconductivity is more easily suppressed.\nConsequently, the sample is not at thermodynamic equilibrium during the time span of one measurement. As a\nresult, the torque signals are different for angular fields\nmeasurements in opposite directions. In order to get reversible angular dependent torque data, a \"vortex shaking\" technique4 was used.

(Color online) Magnetic moment m(T ) of the\nYBa2 Cu3 O7 single crystal, measured in a magnetic field\n\u03bc0 H = 1 mT parallel to the ab-plane. In the ZFC mode\nthe field is applied once the sample is cold, whereas in the FC\nmode the sample is cooled while the field is applied. The ZFC\nand FC magnetization curves show a sharp transition with a\ntransition temperature Tc = 88 K, indicating a high quality\nof the crystal.\n\nfield ( ' 200 Hz, 1 mT) is applied perpendicular to the\nmain external field in order to shake the vortices out of\ntheir pinning sites (Fig. 3).\nThe temperature range of the angular measurements\nwas 77 K to 86 K. The lower temperature bound was\nchosen such as to avoid the lock-in effect (also known as\nintrinsic pinning),42 which influences the torque in a way\nnot accounted for in Eq. (9). When the external field\ndirection becomes close to the ab-plane (\u03b8 = 90\u00b0), the\nmagnetization abruptly aligns with the ab-planes in order\nto minimize the magnetic energy in the superconducting\nstate. However, it \"jumps\" back outside the planes when\nthe external field direction is sufficiently away from the\nab-plane. The upper temperature bound was chosen such\nas to avoid fluctuation effects5 close to Tc . Fluctuation\neffects are not taken into account in the mean-field approximation of the models considered here.\nYBa2 Cu3 O7 has an orthorhombic structure. Taking\ninto account that in this case \u03bba 6= \u03bbb , one has to replace\n\u03b3 by \u03b3ca or \u03b3cb in Eqs. (4), (5), (8), and (9), with the\n4,43\nmagnetic\nand\n\u221a field direction in the ac- or bc-plane,\n\u03bbab = \u03bba \u03bbb is not equal to \u03bba and \u03bbb as in the tetragonal case. In order to check the validity of this tetragonal\napproximation, measurements as a function of angle were\nperformed in both the bc-plane and ac-plane (see Fig. 4).\nAs expected, the data are similar for both orientations,\nthus allowing the analysis within a tetragonal model.\nThe torque data were analyzed with the HC and\nwith the Kogan model.

Panels c) and d) show that the field\ndependence of \u03b3 is only marginal.\n\nsults. The estimated error bars are smaller than the size\nof the data points.\nSince the anisotropy parameter is only weakly field dependent (see Figs. 5c and 5d), we take as the final \u03b3\nvalue the average for 1.4 T and 1 T.The corresponding\ntemperature dependences of \u03b3ca and \u03b3cb are shown in\nFig. 6a. The free fit parameters in Eqs. (5) and (9) are\nthe anisotropy parameter \u03b3ij and the in-plane magnetic\npenetration depth \u03bbab . Since the volume V of the sample\nis not known precisely, the extracted value for \u03bbab may\ndeviate from the intrinsic value. However, the shape of\n\u03bbab (T ) reflects the true temperature dependence, because\nthe volume V is only slightly temperature dependent.\nFigure 6c shows the temperature dependence of 1/\u03bb2ab\nas estimated from the torque data using the Kogan and\nHC model. Over the temperature range studied, \u03b3ca as\nwell as \u03b3cb slightly increase with decreasing temperature,\nwhereas the in-plane anisotropy parameter \u03b3ab is temperature independent, in fair agreement with previous\n\u03bcSR measurements of the magnetic penetration depth\nobtained for a similar sample.18 However, since \u03b3ab ' 1\none should note that it is difficult to draw definite conclusions about its temperature dependence. The tempera-\n\nture dependence of the magnetic penetration depth from\nthe previous \u03bcSR study18 was measured along the three\nprincipal crystallographic axes and was interpreted in\nterms of a mixed order parameter of s+d wave symmetry.\nThe values of \u03b3ca , \u03b3cb and \u03b3ab determined at T ' 80 K,\ntogether with the values obtained by various experimental techniques at different temperatures are summarized\nin Table I. The small differences in the values may be\ndue to the different temperature ranges, the experimental\ntechniques used, or slight differences in the doping of the\nsamples. A determination of the anisotropy from the ratio of the penetration depths requires a careful evaluation\nof \u03bbc and \u03bbab . Any misalignement of the sample with the\napplied magnetic field will result in an underestimation\nof \u03bbc and the deduced \u03b3. In torque measurements, however, the anisotropy is extracted from a fit to the data,\nwithout orientation issues since the model describes the\nvariation of torque in the full angular range. Therefore,\nthe obtained values are much more reliable. The vortex\nshaking technique allows us to avoid an overestimation of\nthe anisotropy due to pinning.47 The parameters \u03b3ca and\n\u03b3cb are slightly different, because of the orthorhombicity\nof the crystal structure. The torque data were analyzed\nhere under the assumption that the field and penetration\ndepth anisotropy parameters are equal. It is possible to\ngeneralize this analysis to the multi-gap case, where these\nparameters are not equal.22 However, such an analysis of\nthe present torque data would not provide reliable results\ndue to the too large number of fit parameters.\nTABLE I.

The temperature dependence of the\nout-of-plane anisotropy parameter found later in ironbased superconductors was also attributed to multi-gap\nsuperconductivity.13,46 This may suggest that the present\nresults are a signature of two-gap superconductivity in\nYBa2 Cu3 O7 , as previously proposed in Ref. 18. However, we note that the temperature dependence of the\nout-of-plane anisotropy parameter observed for cuprates\n\n\u2217\n1\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nis extremely sensitive to the oxygen content. A well\npronounced temperature dependence of the anisotropy\nfor strongly underdoped samples9 becomes very weak for\noverdoped YBa2 Cu3 O7 . This may be related to the evolution of the pseudogap with doping in YBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212\u03b4 .\nMoreover, it suggests that an additional energy scale\nto the superconducting energy gap in the system is\nnecessary to get a temperature dependent out-of-plane\nanisotropy parameter in layered superconductors. Such\nan energy scale may originate from the multi-gap nature\nof superconductivity in MgB2 and in pnictides and from\nthe appearance of the pseudogap in cuprates.\n\nsbosma@physik.uzh.ch\nJ. G.

In the temperature\nrange 0.87 Tc < T < Tc , the anisotropy parameters \u03b3ca\nand \u03b3cb were found to increase by more than 10% with\ndecreasing temperature, but no field dependence was observed. In contrast, the in-plane anisotropy parameter\n\u03b3ab exhibits no temperature nor field dependence. The\nvalues of \u03b3ca , \u03b3cb and \u03b3ab are in good agreement with\nthose reported previously (see Table I). The analysis of\nthe torque data with the Hao-Clem model yields within\n2% the same results as the simpler Kogan model. The\nHao-Clem model does not provide new information on\nthe vortex state of YBa2 Cu3 O7 in the present study.\nThe weak temperature dependence of the out-of-plane\nanisotropy parameter may indicate the presence of two\nenergy scales in the superconducting behavior, related to\nmulti-gap superconductivity or one-gap superconductivity with a pseudogap. To clarify this hypothesis more\nexperimental work is required.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis work was partly supported by the Swiss National\nScience Foundation.\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nS. Kohout, T.
