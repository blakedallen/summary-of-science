This paper is a contribution to the study of the complex interpolation method.\nThe latter originates in 1927 with the famous Marcel Riesz theorem which says that, if 1 \u2264 p0 <\np1 \u2264 \u221e, and if (aij ) is a matrix of norm \u2264 1 simultaneously on lnp0 and lnp1 , then it must be also\nof norm \u2264 1 on lnp for any p0 < p < p1 , and similarly for operators on Lp -spaces. Later on in\n1938, Thorin found the most general form using a complex variable method; see [2] for more on\nthis history.\nThen around 1960, J.L. Lions and independently A. Calder\u00f3n [12] invented the complex interpolation method, which may be viewed as a far reaching \"abstract\" version of the Riesz\u2013Thorin\ntheorem, see [2, 36]. There the pair (Lp0 , Lp1 ) can be replaced by a pair (B0 , B1 ) of Banach spaces\n(assumed compatible in a suitable way). One then defines for any 0 < \u03b8 < 1 the complex interpolation space B\u03b8 = (B0 , B1 )\u03b8 which appears as a continuous deformation of B0 into B1 when \u03b8 varies\nfrom 0 to 1. In many ways, the unit ball B\u03b8 of the space B\u03b8 looks like the \"geometric mean\" of\nthe respective unit balls B0 and B1 of B0 and B1 , i.e. it seems to be the multiplicative analogue of\nthe Minkowski sum (1 \u2212 \u03b8)B0 + \u03b8B1 . The main result of this paper relates directly to the sources\nof interpolation theory: we give a description of the space B\u03b8 = (B0 , B1 )\u03b8 when B0 = B(lnp0 ) and\nB1 = B(lnp1 ), or more generally for the pair B0 = B(Lp0 (\u03bc)), B1 = B(Lp1 (\u03bc)).\nAlthough our description of the norm of B\u03b8 for these pairs is, admittedly, rather \"abstract\" it\nshows that the problem of calculating B\u03b8 is equivalent to the determination of a certain class of\nBanach spaces\n(SQ(p0 ), SQ(p1 ))\u03b8\nroughly interpolated between the classes SQ(p0 ) and SQ(p1 ) where SQ(p) denotes the class of\nsubspaces of quotients (subquotients in short) of Lp -spaces.\nWhen p0 = 1 or = \u221e, this class SQ(p0 ) is the class of all Banach spaces while when p1 = 2,\nSQ(p1 ) is the class of all Hilbert spaces. In that case, the class (SQ(p0 ), SQ(p1 ))\u03b8 is the class of all\nthe Banach spaces B which can be written (isometrically) as B = (B0 , B1 )\u03b8 for some compatible\npair (B0 , B1 ) with\nBj \u2208 SQ(pj )\n(j = 0, 1).\nWe already considered this notion in a previous paper [58]. There we called \u03b8-Hilbertian the\nresulting spaces. However, in the present context we need to slightly extend the notion of \u03b8Hilbertian, so we decided to rename \"strictly \u03b8-Hilbertian\" the spaces called \u03b8-Hilbertian in [58].\nIn our new notion of \"\u03b8-Hilbertian\" we found it necessary to use the complex interpolation method\nfor \"families\" {Bz | z \u2208 \u2202D} defined on the boundary of a complex domain D and not only pairs\nof Banach spaces\nThis generalization was developed around 1980 in a series of papers mainly by Coifman, Cwikel,\nRochberg, Sagher, Semmes and Weiss (cf. [13, 14, 15, 73, 16]). There \u2202D can be the unit circle\nand, restricting to the n-dimensional case for simplicity, we may take Bz = (Cn , k kz ) where\n{k kz | z \u2208 \u2202D} is a measurable family of norms on Cn (with a suitable nondegeneracy). The\ninterpolated spaces now consist in a family {B(\u03be) | \u03be \u2208 D} which extends the boundary data\n{Bz | z \u2208 \u2202D} in a specific way reminiscent of the harmonic extension. When Bz = lnp(z) with\n1 \u2264 p(z) \u2264 \u221e (z \u2208 \u2202D) one finds B(\u03be) = lnp(\u03be) where p(\u03be) is determined by\n\u22121\n\np(\u03be)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\np(z)\u22121 \u03bc\u03be (dz)\n\n\u2202D\n\nwhere \u03bc\u03be is the harmonic (probability) measure of \u03be \u2208 D relative to \u2202D.\nConsider then an n \u00d7 n matrix a = [aij ], let \u03b2z = B(lnp(z) ) for z \u2208 \u2202D and let \u03b2(\u03be) (\u03be \u2208 D) be\nthe resulting interpolation space.\n3\n\n\fOne of our main results is the equality\nkak\u03b2(\u03be) = sup{kaX : lnp(\u03be) (X) \u2192 lnp(\u03be) (X)}\n\n(0.1)\n\nwhere aX is the matrix [aij ] viewed as acting on X n in the natural way and where the supremum\nruns over all the n-dimensional Banach spaces X in the class C(\u03be). The class C(\u03be) consists of all\nthe spaces X which can be written as X = X(\u03be) for some (compatible) family {X(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D}\nsuch that X(z) \u2208 SQ(p(z)) for all z in \u2202D and of all ultraproducts of such spaces.\nBy a sort of \"duality,\" this also provides us with a characterization of this class C(\u03be), or more\nprecisely of the class of subspaces of quotients of spaces in C(\u03be): a Banach space X belongs to the\nlatter class (resp. is C-isomorphic to a space in that class) iff for any n\n(0.2)\n\nsup\nkak\u03b2(\u03be) \u22641\n\nkaX : lnp(\u03be) (X) \u2192 lnp(\u03be) (X)k \u2264 1 (resp. \u2264 C).\n\nConsider for example the case when p(z) takes only two values p(z) = 1 and p(z) = 2 with\nmeasure respectively 1 \u2212 \u03b8 and \u03b8. Then \u03b2(0) = (B(ln1 ), B(ln2 ))\u03b8 and C(0) is the class of all the\nspaces which can be written as X(0) for some boundary data \u2202D \u220b z 7\u2212\u2192 X(z) such that X(z) is\nHilbertian on a subset of normalized Haar measure \u2265 \u03b8 (and is Banach on the complement). We\ncall these spaces \u03b8-Euclidean and we call \u03b8-Hilbertian all ultraproducts of \u03b8-Euclidean spaces of\narbitrary dimension.\nActually, our result can be formulated in a more general framework: we give ourselves classes\nof Banach spaces {C(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} with minimal assumptions and we set by definition\nkak\u03b2(z) = sup kaX : lnp(z) (X) \u2192 lnp(z) (X)k.\nX\u2208C(z)\n\nThen (0.1) and (0.2) remain true with C(z) in the place of SQ(p(z)). In particular, we may now\nrestrict to the case when p(z) = 2 for all z in \u2202D. Consider for instance the case when C(z) = ln2\nfor z in a subset (say an arc) of \u2202D of normalized Haar measure \u03b8 and let C(z) be the class of\nall n-dimensional Banach spaces on the complement. Then (0.1) yields a description of the space\n(B0 , B1 )\u03b8 when B0 , B1 is the following pair of normed spaces consisting of n \u00d7 n matrices:\nkakB0 = k[|aij |]kB(ln2 )\n\nkakB1 = k[aij ]kB(ln2 ) .\n\nMore generally, if B1 = B(L2 (\u03bc)) and if B0 is the Banach space Br (L2 (\u03bc)) of all regular operators\nT on L2 (\u03bc) (i.e. those T with a kernel (T (s, t)) such that |T (s, t)| is bounded on L2 (\u03bc)), then we are\nable to describe the space (Br (L2 (\u03bc)), B(L2 (\u03bc)))\u03b8 . By [1] this also yields (B0 , B1 )\u03b8 as the closure\nof B0 \u2229 B1 in (B0 , B1 )\u03b8 .\nThe origin of this paper is a question raised by Vincent Lafforgue: what are the Banach spaces\nX satisfying the following property: there is a function \u03b5 \u2192 \u2206X (\u03b5) tending to zero with \u03b5 > 0 such\nthat every operator T : L2 \u2192 L2 with kT k \u2264 \u03b5 that is simultaneously contractive (i.e. of norm\n\u2264 1) on L1 and on L\u221e must be of norm \u2264 \u2206X (\u03b5) on L2 (X) ?\nWe show that \u2206X (\u03b5) \u2208 O(\u03b5\u03b1 ) for some \u03b1 > 0 iff X is isomorphic to a subspace of a quotient of\na \u03b8-Hilbertian space for some \u03b8 > 0 (see Corollary 6.7). We also give a sort of structural, but less\nsatisfactory, characterization of the spaces X such that \u2206X (\u03b5) \u2192 0 when \u03b5 \u2192 0 (see Theorem 9.2).\nV. Lafforgue's question is motivated by the (still open) problem whether expanding graphs can\nbe coarsely embedded into uniformly convex Banach spaces; he observed that such an embedding\nis impossible into X if \u2206X (\u03b5) \u2192 0 when \u03b5 \u2192 0. See \u00a73 for more on this.\n4\n\n\fThe preceding results all have analogues in the recently developed theory of operator spaces\n([18, 66]). Indeed, the author previously introduced and studied mainly in [64, 63] all the necessary\ningredients, notably complex interpolation and operator space valued non-commutative Lp -spaces.\nWith these tools, it is an easy task to check the generalized statements, so that we merely review\nthem, giving only indications of proofs. In addition, in the last section, we include an example\nhopefully demonstrating that interpolation of families (i.e. involving more than a pair) of operator\nspaces, appears very naturally in harmonic analysis on the free group.\nLet us now describe the contents, section by section. In \u00a71, we review some background on\nregular operators. An operator T on Lp (\u03bc) is called regular if there is a positive operator S, still\nbounded on Lp (\u03bc), such that\n\u2200f \u2208 Lp (\u03bc)\n\n|T f | \u2264 S(|f |).\n\nThe regular norm of T is equal to the infimum of kSk. These operators can be characterized in\nmany ways. They play an extremal role in Banach space valued analysis because they are precisely\nthe operators on Lp (\u03bc) that extend (with the same norm) to Lp (\u03bc; X) for any Banach space X.\nIn \u00a72 we use the fact that regular operators on Lp (\u03bc) (1 < p < \u221e) with regular norm \u2264 1 are\nclosely related (up to a change of density) to what we call fully contractive operators, i.e. operators\nthat are of norm \u2264 1 simultaneously on L1 and L\u221e .\nThis allows us to rewrite the definition of \u2206X (\u03b5) in terms of regular operators.\nIn \u00a74, we describe a certain duality between, on one hand, classes of Banach spaces, and on the\nother one, classes of operators on Lp . Although these ideas already appeared (cf. [40, 41, 29, 35]),\nthe viewpoint we emphasize was left sort of implicit. We hope to stimulate further research on the\nlist of related questions that we present in this section.\nIn \u00a75, we present background on the complex interpolation method for families (or \"fields\") of\nBanach spaces. This was developed mainly by Coifman, Cwikel, Rochberg, Sagher, Semmes, and\nWeiss cf. [13, 14, 15, 16, 73].\nIn \u00a76, we generalize the notion of \u03b8-Hilbertian Banach space from our previous paper [58]. We\nfirst call \u03b8-Euclidean any n-dimensional space which can be obtained as the interpolation space at\nthe center of the unit disc D associated to a family of n-dimensional spaces {X(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} such\nthat X(z) is Hilbertian for a set of z with (Lebesgue) measure \u2265 \u03b8. Then we call \u03b8-Hilbertian all\nultraproducts of \u03b8-Euclidean spaces. In our previous definition (now called strictly \u03b8-Hilbertian),\nwe only considered a two-valued family {X(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D}. We are then able to describe the\ninterpolation space\n(Br , B)\u03b8\nwhere Br and B denote respectively the regular and the bounded operators on l2 . We then\ncharacterize the Banach spaces X such that \u2206X (\u03b5) \u2208 O(\u03b5\u03b1 ) for some \u03b1 > 0 as the subspaces of\nquotients of \u03b8-Hilbertian spaces.\nIn \u00a77, we briefly compare our notion of \u03b8-Hilbertian with the corresponding \"arcwise\" one,\nwhere the set of z's for which X(z) is Hilbertian is required to be an arc.\nIn \u00a78, we turn to Fourier and Schur multipliers: we can describe analogously the complex\ninterpolation spaces (B0 , B1 )\u03b8 when B0 (resp. B1 ) is the space of measures (resp. pseudo-measures)\non a locally compact Abelian group G (and similarly on an amenable group). We also treat the case\nwhen B0 (resp. B1 ) is the class of bounded Schur multipliers on B(l2 ) (resp. on the Hilbert\u2013Schmidt\nclass S2 on l2 ). In the latter case, B1 can be identified with the space of bounded functions on\nN \u00d7 N.\nIn \u00a79, we give a characterization of \"uniformly curved\" spaces, i.e. the Banach spaces X such\nthat \u2206X (\u03b5) \u2192 0 when \u03b5 \u2192 0. This appears as a real interpolation result, but is less satisfactory\nthan in the case \u2206X (\u03b5) \u2208 O(\u03b5\u03b1 ) for some \u03b1 > 0 and many natural questions remain open.\n5\n\n\fIn \u00a710, we generalize an extension property of regular operators from [61] which may be of\nindependent interest. See [46] for related questions. This result will probably be relevant if one\ntries, in analogy with [41], to characterize the subspaces or the complemented subspaces of \u03b8Hilbertian spaces. In particular we could not distinguish any of the two latter classes from that of\nsubquotients of \u03b8-Hilbertian spaces. The paper [21] contains useful related information. We should\nmention that an extension property similar to ours appears in [35, 1.3.2].\nIn \u00a711, we describe the complex interpolation spaces (B0 , B1 )\u03b8 when B0 = B(Lp0 (\u03bc)) and\nB1 = B(Lp1 (\u03bc)) with 1 \u2264 p0 , p1 \u2264 \u221e. Actually, the right framework seems to be here again the\ninterpolation of families {Bz | z \u2208 \u2202D} where Bz = B(lnp(z) ). We treat this case and an even\nmore general one related to the \"duality\" discussed in \u00a73, see Theorem 11.1 for the most general\nstatement.\nIn \u00a712 and \u00a713, we turn to the analogues of the preceding results in the operator space framework. There operators on Lp (\u03bc) are replaced by mappings acting on \"non-commutative\" Lp -spaces\nassociated to a trace. The main results are entirely parallel to the ones obtained in \u00a76 and \u00a711 in\nthe commutative case.\nLastly, in \u00a714, we describe a family of operator spaces closely connected to various works on\nthe \"non-commutative Khintchine inequalities\" for homogeneous polynomials of degree d (see e.g.\n[54]). Here we specifically need to consider a family {X(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} taking (d + 1)-values but we\nare able to compute precisely the interpolation at the center of D (or at any point inside D).\n\n1\n\nPreliminaries. Regular operators\n\nLet 1 \u2264 p < \u221e throughout this section. For operators on Lp it is well known that the notions of\n\"regular' and \"order bounded\" coincide, so we will simply use the term regular. We refer to [50, 72]\nfor general facts on this. The results of this section are all essentially well known, we only recall a\nfew short proofs for the reader's convenience and to place them in the context that is relevant for\nus.\n\n1.1\nWe say that an operator T : Lp (\u03bc) \u2192 Lp (\u03bd) is regular if there is a constant C such that for all n\nand all x1 , . . . , xn in Lp (\u03bc) we have\nk sup |T xk | kp \u2264 Ck sup |xk | kp .\nWe denote by kT kreg the smallest C for which this holds and by Br (Lp (\u03bc), Lp (\u03bd)) (or simply\nBr (Lp (\u03bc)) if \u03bc = \u03bd) the Banach space of all such operators equipped with the norm k kreg .\nClearly this definition makes sense more generally for operators T : \u039b1 \u2192 \u039b2 between two\nBanach lattices \u039b1 , \u039b2 .\n\n1.2\nIt is known that T : Lp (\u03bc) \u2192 Lp (\u03bd) is regular iff T \u2297 idX : Lp (\u03bc; X) \u2192 Lp (\u03bd; X) is bounded for\nany Banach space X and\n(1.1)\n\nkT kreg = sup kT \u2297 idX : Lp (\u03bc; X) \u2192 Lp (\u03bd; X)k.\nX\n\nThis assertion follows from the fact that any finite dimensional subspace Y \u2282 X can be embedded\nalmost isometrically into ln\u221e for some large enough n. See 1.7 below. The preceding definition\ncorresponds to ln\u221e for all n, or equivalently to X = c0 .\n6\n\n\fActually, T : Lp (\u03bc) \u2192 Lp (\u03bd) is regular iff there is a constant C such that for all n and all x1 , . . . , xn\nin Lp (\u03bc) we have\nX\nX\nk\n|T xk | kp \u2264 Ck\n|xk | kp ,\n\nand the smallest such C is equal to kT kreg . This follows from the fact that any finite dimensional\nspace X is almost isometric to a quotient of ln1 for some large enough n.\n\n1.3\nA (bounded) positive (meaning positivity preserving) operator T is regular and kT kreg = kT k.\nMore precisely, it is a classical fact that T is regular iff there is a bounded positive operator\nS : Lp (\u03bc) \u2192 Lp (\u03bd) (here 1 \u2264 p < \u221e) such that |T (x)| \u2264 S(|x|) for any x in Lp (\u03bc). Moreover, there\nis a smallest S with this property, denoted by |T |, and we have:\nkT kreg = k |T | k.\nIn case Lp (\u03bc) = Lp (\u03bd) = lp , the operator T can be described by a matrix T = [tij ]. Then\n|T | = [|tij |].\nSimilarly, if T is given by a nice kernel (K(s, t)) then |T | corresponds to the kernel (|K(s, t)|).\n\n1.4\nIn this context, although we will not use this, we should probably mention the following identities\n(see [58]) that are closely related to Schur's criterion for boundedness of a matrix on l2 and its (less\nwell known) converse:\n(B(ln1 ), B(ln\u221e ))\u03b8 = Br (lnp , lnp )\n(B(l1 ), B(c0 ))\u03b8 = Br (lp , lp ).\nThese are isometric isomorphisms with p defined as usual by p\u22121 = (1 \u2212 \u03b8).\nMore explicitly, a matrix b = (bij ) is in the unit ball of Br (lnp ) iff there are matrices b0 and b1\nsatisfying\n|bij | \u2264 |b0ij |1\u2212\u03b8 |b1ij |\u03b8\nand such that\nsup\ni\n\nX\n\nj\n\n|b0ij | \u2264 1\n\nand\n\nsup\nj\n\nX\n\ni\n\n|b1ij | \u2264 1.\n\nThe \"if\" direction boils down to Schur's well known classical criterion when p = 2 (see also [38]).\n\n1.5\nWe will now describe the unit ball of the dual of Br (ln2 ).\nLemma 1.1. Consider an n \u00d7 n matrix \u03c6 = (\u03c6ij ). Then\n\u001a\u0010X\n\u00111/2 \u001b\nXn\nn\n2\n2\n|xi |\n(1.2)\nk\u03c6kBr (ln2 )\u2217 = inf\n|yj |\n1\n\nwhere the infimum runs over all x, y in ln2 such that\n\u2200i, j\n\n|\u03c6ij | \u2264 |xi | |yj |.\n7\n\n1\n\n\fProof. Let C be the set of all \u03c6 for which there are x, y in the unit ball of ln2 such that |\u03c6ij | \u2264 |xi | |yj |.\nClearly we have for all a in B(ln2 )\nkakBr (ln2 ) = k[|aij |]k = sup\n\u03c6\u2208C\n\nX\n\n\u03c6ij aij .\n\nTherefore, to prove the Lemma it suffices to check that C is convex (since the right-hand side of\n(1.2) is the gauge of C). This is easy to check: consider \u03c6, \u03c6\u2032 in C and 0 < \u03b8 < 1 then assuming\n|\u03c6ij | \u2264 |xi | |yj | and |\u03c6\u2032ij | \u2264 |x\u2032i | |yj\u2032 |\nwith x, y, x\u2032 , y \u2032 all in the Euclidean unit ball, we have by Cauchy-Schwarz\n|(1 \u2212 \u03b8)\u03c6ij + \u03b8\u03c6\u2032ij | \u2264 ((1 \u2212 \u03b8)|xi |2 + \u03b8|x\u2032i |2 )1/2 ((1 \u2212 \u03b8)|yj |2 + \u03b8|yj\u2032 |2 )1/2 ,\nwhich shows that (1 \u2212 \u03b8)\u03c6 + \u03b8\u03c6\u2032 is in C.\nLet C be as above. Then \u03c6 \u2208 C iff there are hi , kj in Cn such that \u03c6ij = hhi , kj i and\nX\nX\nkhi k2ln1 \u2264 1,\nkkj k2ln\u221e \u2264 1.\n\nIndeed, if this holds we can write\n\n|\u03c6ij | \u2264\n\nX\n\nm\n\n|hi (m)| |kj (m)| \u2264 khi kln1 kkj kln\u221e\n\nfrom which \u03c6 \u2208 C follows. Conversely, if \u03c6 \u2208 C, we may assume \u03c6ij = xi yj \u03b3ij with |\u03b3ij | \u2264 1,\nkxk2 \u2264 1, kyk2 \u2264 1. Let (em ) denote the canonical basis of Cn . Then, letting\nX\nhi = xi ei and kj = yj\n\u03b3mj em\nm\n\nwe obtain the desired representation.\n\n1.6\nb 2 (\u03bc\u2032 ),\nThe predual of B(L2 (\u03bc), L2 (\u03bc\u2032 )) is classically identified with the projective tensor product L2 (\u03bc)\u2297L\n\u2032\ni.e. the completion of the algebraic tensor product L2 (\u03bc) \u2297 L2 (\u03bc ) with respect to the norm\nX\nkT k\u2227 = inf\nkxm kkym k\n\nwhere the infimum runs over all representations of T as a sum T = \u03a3xm \u2297 ym of rank one tensors.\nLet T (s, t) = \u03a3xm (s)ym (t) be the corresponding kernel in L2 (\u03bc \u00d7 \u03bc\u2032 ).

The original ideas can be traced back to [23].\nAn operator v : E \u2192 F between Banach spaces is called nuclear if it can be written\nP \u2217 as an absolutely\n\u2217\n\u2217\nconvergent series of rank one operators, i.e. there are xn \u2208 E , yn \u2208 F with\nkxn kkyn k < \u221e such\nthat\nX\nv(x) =\nhx\u2217n , xiyn \u2200x \u2208 E.\n\nThe space of such maps is denoted by N (E, F ). The nuclear norm N (v) is defined as\nX\nN (v) = inf\nkx\u2217n kkyn k,\n\nwhere the infimum runs over all possible such representations of v. Equipped with this norm,\nN (E, F ) is a Banach space.\nIf E and F are finite dimensional, it is well known that we have isometric identities\nB(E, F )\u2217 = N (F, E)\n\nand N (E, F )\u2217 = B(F, E)\n\nwith respect to the duality defined for u : E \u2192 F and v : F \u2192 E by\nhu, vi = tr(uv).\nWe will denote by \u0393H (E, F ) the set of operators u : E \u2192 F that factorize through a Hilbert\nspace, i.e. there are bounded operators u1 : H \u2192 F , u2 : E \u2192 H such that u = u1 u2 . We equip\nthis space with the norm \u03b3H (.) defined by\n\u03b3H (u) = inf{ku1 k ku2 k}\nwhere the infimum runs over all such factorizations.\n\u2217 (.) the norm that is dual to \u03b3 (.) in the above duality, i.e. for all v : F \u2192 E\nWe will denote by \u03b3H\nH\nwe set\n\u2217\n\u03b3H\n(v) = sup{|tr(uv)| | u \u2208 \u0393H (E, F ), \u03b3H (u) \u2264 1.}\nProposition 1.2. Consider v : ln\u221e \u2192 ln1 .\n\u2217 (v) \u2264 1 iff there are \u03bb, \u03bc in the unit ball of ln and (a ) in the unit ball of B(ln ) such that\n(i) \u03b3H\nij\n2\n2\nvij = \u03bbi aij \u03bcj .\n\n10\n\n\f(ii) N (v) \u2264 1 iff there are \u03bb\u2032 , \u03bc\u2032 in the unit ball of ln2 and (bij ) in the unit ball of Br (ln2 ) such that\nvij = \u03bb\u2032i bij \u03bc\u2032j .\nP\nProof. (i) is a classical fact (cf. e.g. [65, Prop. 5.4]). To verify (ii), note that N (v) =\n|vij |.\nij\n\nAssume N (v) = 1. Let then\n\n\u03bb\u2032i\n\nhave then (with the convention\n\nP\nwith b0ij = |vij |( j |vij |)\u22121\nby 1.4 we have kbkreg \u2264 1.\n\n\u0010P\n\u00111/2\nP\n|vij |\nand bij = vij (\u03bb\u2032i \u03bc\u2032j )\u22121 .

Consider \u03c6 : ln2 \u2192 ln2 .\n(i) k\u03c6kB(ln2 )\u2217 \u2264 1 iff there are \u03bb, \u03bc in the unit ball of ln2 and v : ln1 \u2192 ln\u221e with \u03b3H (v) \u2264 1 such\nthat \u03c6ij = \u03bbi vij \u03bcj for all i, j.\n(ii) k\u03c6kBr (ln2 )\u2217 \u2264 1 iff there are \u03bb, \u03bc in the unit ball of ln2 and v : ln1 \u2192 ln\u221e with kvk \u2264 1 such that\n\u03c6ij = \u03bbi vij \u03bcj for all i, j.\nProof. (i) If \u03c6 factors as indicated we have v = v1 v2 with v1 : H \u2192 ln\u221e and v2 : ln1 \u2192 H such that\nkv1 kkv2 k \u2264 1. Let D\u03bb and D\u03bc denote the diagonal operators with coefficients (\u03bbi ) and (\u03bcj ). We\nhave then \u03c6 = D\u03bb v1 v2 D\u03bc , hence using the Hilbert\u2013Schmidt norm k * kHS we find that k\u03c6kB(ln2 )\u2217\n(which is the trace class norm of \u03c6) is \u2264 kD\u03bb v1 kHS kv2 D\u03bc kHS \u2264 1. Conversely, if the trace class\nnorm of \u03c6 is \u2264 1, then for some H Hilbert (actually H = ln2 ) we can write \u03c6 = \u03c61 \u03c62 , \u03c62 : ln2 \u2192 H\nand \u03c61 : H \u2192 ln2 such that k\u03c61 kHS k\u03c62 kHS \u2264 1. Let v2 : ln1 \u2192 H and v1 : H \u2192 ln\u221e be the maps\ndefined by v2 ej = (\u03c62 ej )k\u03c62 ej k\u22121 and v1\u2217 ei = (\u03c6\u22171 ei )k\u03c6\u22171 ei k\u22121 . Note that kv1 k = kv2 k = 1. Let\nv = v1 v2 and \u03bbi = k\u03c6\u22171 ei k, \u03bcj = k\u03c62 ej k. We have then kvk \u2264 1 and \u03c6ij = h\u03c6ej , ei i = \u03bbi vij \u03bcj , which\nverifies (i).\n(ii) By Lemma 1.1, k\u03c6kBr (ln2 )\u2217 \u2264 1 iff there are \u03bb, \u03bc in the unit ball of ln2 and v : ln1 \u2192 ln\u221e with\nkvk = sup |vij | \u2264 1 such that \u03c6ij = \u03bbi vij \u03bcj .\nij\n\n1.9\nIn the sequel, we will invoke several times \"a measurable selection argument.\" Each time, the\nfollowing well known fact will be sufficient for our purposes. Consider a continuous surjection\nf : K \u2192 L from a compact metric space K onto another one L. Then there is a Borel measurable\nmap g : L \u2192 K lifting f , i.e. such that f \u25e6g is the identity on L. This (now folkloric) fact essentially\ngoes back to von Neumann. The references [33, p. 9] or [76, chap. 5] contain considerably more\nsophisticated results.\n\n1.10\nThroughout this memoir (at least until we reach \u00a712), given an operator T : Lp (\u03bc) \u2192 Lp (\u03bd) such\nthat T \u2297 idX extends to a bounded operator from Lp (\u03bc; X) to Lp (\u03bd; X), we will denote for short\nby\nTX : Lp (\u03bc; X) \u2192 Lp (\u03bd; X)\nthe resulting operator. In \u00a712, this notation will be extended to the non-commutative setting.\n11\n\n\f2\n\nRegular and fully contractive operators\n\nFor short we say that an operator T : Lp (\u03bc) \u2192 Lp (\u03bd), (1 < p < \u221e) is \"fully contractive\" if T is a\ncontraction from Lq (\u03bc) to Lq (\u03bd) simultaneously for q = 1 and q = \u221e (and hence for all 1 \u2264 q \u2264 \u221e\nby interpolation).\nIt is known (and easy to show) that this implies kT kreg \u2264 1. Indeed, since for T : Lq (\u03bc) \u2192 Lq (\u03bd)\nwe have kT k = kT kreg both for q = 1 and q = \u221e, it follows by interpolation that kT : Lp (\u03bc) \u2192\nLp (\u03bd)kreg \u2264 1.\nIn the next statement, we use a change of density argument to replace fully contractive operators\nby regular ones in the definition of \u2206X . This kind of argument (related to the classical \"Schur test\"\nand its converse) is well known, see e.g. [38, 34, 78].\nProposition 2.1. Let X be a Banach space. Fix 0 < \u03b5 < 1 and \u03b4 > 0. The following are equivalent:\n(i) For any n and any n \u00d7 n matrix T = [aij ] with kT : ln2 \u2192 ln2 k \u2264 \u03b5 and such that kT : ln2 \u2192\nln2 kreg \u2264 1, we have kTX : ln2 (X) \u2192 ln2 (X)k \u2264 \u03b4.\n(i)\u2032 For any n and any n \u00d7 n matrix T = [aij ] with kT : ln2 \u2192 ln2 k \u2264 \u03b5 which is fully contractive\n(i.e. contractive on lnq for all 1 \u2264 q \u2264 \u221e), we have\nkTX : ln2 (X) \u2192 ln2 (X)k \u2264 \u03b4.\n(ii) For any measure spaces (\u03a9, \u03bc), (\u03a9\u2032 , \u03bc\u2032 ), for any regular operator T : L2 (\u03bc) \u2192 L2 (\u03bc\u2032 ) with\nkT kreg \u2264 1 and kT k \u2264 \u03b5, we have kTX : L2 (X) \u2192 L2 (X)k \u2264 \u03b4.\n(ii)\u2032 For any (\u03a9, \u03bc), (\u03a9\u2032 , \u03bc\u2032 ) and any fully contractive T : L2 (\u03bc) \u2192 L2 (\u03bc\u2032 ) with kT k \u2264 \u03b5 we have\nkTX : L2 (X) \u2192 L2 (X)k \u2264 \u03b4.\nProof. By discretization arguments one can show rather easily that (i) \u21d4 (ii) and (i)\u2032 \u21d4 (ii)\u2032 .\nMoreover (i) \u21d2 (i)\u2032 and (ii) \u21d2 (ii)\u2032 are trivial, since fully contractive implies regular. Therefore, it\nsuffices to show (ii)\u2032 \u21d2 (i). Assume (ii)\u2032 . It suffices to consider T = [aij ] with kT : ln2 \u2192 ln2 k \u2264 \u03b5\nand such that kT : ln2 \u2192 ln2 kreg < 1, so that S = [|aij |] also has norm < 1 on ln2 . Without loss of\ngenerality, we may assume (by density) that |aij | > 0 for all i, j and actually that kS : ln2 \u2192 ln2 k = 1.\nBy Perron\u2013Frobenius, there is \u03be \u2208 ln2 with \u03bei > 0 for all i such that SS \u2217 \u03be = \u03be. Let then \u03b7 = S \u2217 \u03be.\nWe have then a fortiori:\nS\u03b7 \u2264 \u03be (resp. S \u2217 \u03be \u2264 \u03b7).\n\nThis implies that [\u03bei\u22121 |aij |\u03b7j ] (resp. [\u03bei |aij |\u03b7j\u22121 ]) is a contraction on ln\u221e (resp. ln1 ). Let \u03bc (resp. \u03bc\u2032 )\nP 2\nP 2\ndenote the measure\n\u03b7j \u03b4j (resp.\n\u03bei \u03b4i ) on {1, . . . , n}. Then, we find that the kernel K(i, j) =\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u03bei aij \u03b7j defines a fully contractive operator Tb from L1 (\u03bc) to L1 (\u03bc\u2032 ). More precisely, Tb is defined\nby\nZ\nb\n\u2200f \u2208 L1 (\u03bc)\nT f = K(s, t)f (t)d\u03bc(t)\nor equivalently\n(2.1)\nAssuming (ii)\u2032 , this implies\n\n(Tbf )i =\n\nX\n\nj\n\nK(i, j)f (j)\u03b7j2 =\n\nX\n\n\u03be \u22121 aij \u03b7j .\nj i\n\nkTbX : L2 (\u03bc; X) \u2192 L2 (\u03bc\u2032 ; X)k \u2264 \u03b4.\n12\n\n\fMore explicitly, for any x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) in L2 (\u03bc; X) we have by (2.1)\n\u0012X\n\n\u03be2\ni i\n\nX\n\n\u03be \u22121 aij \u03b7j xj\nj i\n\n2\n\n\u00131/2\n\n\u2264\u03b4\n\n\u0010X\n\n\u03b7j2 kxj k2\n\n\u00111/2\n\nTherefore (replacing (xj ) by (\u03b7j\u22121 xj )) we conclude kTX : ln2 (X) \u2192 ln2 (X)k \u2264 \u03b4.\nIn view of V. Lafforgue's question mentioned above it is natural to introduce the following\n\"modulus\" associated to any Banach space X\n\u2206X (\u03b5) = sup{kTX k}\nwhere the supremum runs over all pairs of measure spaces (\u03a9, \u03bc), (\u03a9\u2032 , \u03bc\u2032 ) and all operators T : L2 (\u03bc) \u2192\nL2 (\u03bc\u2032 ) such that kT kreg \u2264 1 and kT k \u2264 \u03b5.\nBy the preceding statement, \u2206X (\u03b5) reduces to:\n(2.2)\n\n\u2206X (\u03b5) = sup sup{kTX k | T \u2208 B(ln2 )k|T |k \u2264 1, kT k \u2264 \u03b5}.\nn\u22651\n\nMoreover, we also have\n(2.3)\n\n\u2206X (\u03b5) = sup sup{kTX k | T \u2208 B(ln2 ) fully contractive with kT k \u2264 \u03b5}.\nn\u22651\n\nWe propose the following terminology:\nDefinition. A Banach space X is \"curved\" if \u2206X (\u03b50 ) < 1 for some \u03b50 < 1.\nWe say that X is \"fully curved\" if \u2206X (\u03b5) < 1 for any \u03b5 < 1.\nWe say that X is \"uniformly curved\" if \u2206X (\u03b5) \u2192 0 when \u03b5 \u2192 0.\nEquivalently, X is curved iff there is \u03b50 > 0 such that \u2206X (\u03b5) < 1 for all \u03b5 < \u03b50 .\nIf X is C-isomorphic to Y , then C \u22121 \u2206Y (\u03b5) \u2264 \u2206X (\u03b5) \u2264 C\u2206Y (\u03b5), so that X is uniformly curved iff\nY also is.\nTrivially, any Hilbert space H is \"fully curved\" and \"uniformly curved\" since \u2206H (\u03b5) = \u03b5 for any\n0 < \u03b5 < 1.\n1/2\nEvery finite dimensional space is \"curved,\" since \u2206X\n\u221a(\u03b5) \u2264 (dim(X)) d\u03b5 for all 0 < \u03b5 < 1. Indeed,\nit is well known that any d-dimensional space X is d-isomorphic to l2 (see e.g. [59, p.16]).\nHowever, there are simple examples of 2-dimensional spaces that are not fully curved: for instance\nl21 or l2\u221e , since these are not \"uniformly nonsquare\".\nRecall that X is called uniformly nonsquare if there is a number \u03b4 < 1 such that for any pair x, y\nin the unit ball we have either k2\u22121 (x + y)k \u2264 \u03b4 or k2\u22121 (x \u2212 y)k \u2264 \u03b4.\nBy interpolation (see below), if 1 < p < \u221e, any Lp -space is \"fully curved\" and \"uniformly curved\".\nThe operator that V. Lafforgue had in mind initially is the operator \u03c4 : l22 \u2192 l22 defined by\n\u03c4 (x, y) = (2\u22121 (x + y), 2\u22121 (x \u2212 y)). This is clearly fully contractive but since \u03c4 is equal to 2\u22121/2 \u00d7\n(rotation by \u03c0/4) we have k\u03c4 k = 2\u22121/2 < 1.\nThis shows X fully curved \u21d2 X uniformly nonsquare. Indeed, if \u2206X (2\u22121/2 ) < 1 then X is\nuniformly nonsquare since, using \u03c4X , we find, for any pair x, y in the unit ball\n(2\u22122 kx + yk2 + 2\u22122 kx \u2212 yk2 )1/2 \u2264 \u2206X (2\u22121/2 )(kxk2 + kyk2 )1/2\nand hence\nmin{k2\u22121 (x + y)k, k2\u22121 (x \u2212 y)k} \u2264 \u2206X (2\u22121/2 ) < 1.\n13\n\n\fModulo the beautiful results of James and Enflo ([32, 19]) on \"super-reflexivity,\" this observation\nshows that any uniformly curved Banach space is isomorphic to a uniformly convex one.\nRecall that a Banach space is called uniformly convex if \u03b4X (\u03b5) > 0 for any 0 < \u03b5 \u2264 2 where\n\u03b4X (\u03b5) = inf{1 \u2212 k2\u22121 (x + y)k | kxk \u2264 1, kyk \u2264 1, kx \u2212 yk \u2265 \u03b5}.\nIn [61], we proved that any uniformly convex space can be equivalently renormed so that its uniform\nconvexity modulus satisfies \u03b4X (\u03b5) \u2265 C\u03b5q \u2200\u03b5 \u2208 [0, 2] for some q < \u221e (and for some constant C > 0).\nThus it is natural to raise the following:\nProblem 2.2. Can any uniformly curved (or even merely curved) space be equivalently renormed\nto be fully curved ?\nProblem 2.3. If X is uniformly curved, is it true that \u2206X (\u03b5) \u2208 O(\u03b5\u03b1 ) for some \u03b1 > 0 ?\nBy [58], the answer is positive for Banach lattices.\nWe will prove below (see Corollary 6.7) that a Banach space X satisfies this iff it is isomorphic\nto a subquotient of a \u03b8-Hilbertian space for some \u03b8 > 0. This provides a rather strong motivation\nfor the preceding question.\nA similar reasoning applied to the operator \u03c4 \u2297n shows that if \u2206X (2\u2212n/2 ) < 1 then X does not\nn\ncontain almost isometrically l12 (viewed here, exceptionally, as a real Banach space). We say X\ne \u2282 X with Banach\u2013Mazur\ncontains E almost isometrically if for any \u03b5 > 0 there is a subspace E\ne\ndistance d(E, E) < 1 + \u03b5.\nBy known results (see [49]), this shows that X curved \u21d2 X of type p for some p > 1. However, a\nstronger conclusion can be reached using the Hilbert transform, say in its simplest discrete matricial\nform. Fix n \u2265 1. Let \u0393(n) = [\u0393(n)(i, j)] be the Hilbert n \u00d7 n-matrix defined by\n\u0393(n)(i, j) = (n \u2212 (i + j))\u22121\n\nif n \u2212 (i + j) 6= 0,\n\nand \u0393(n)(i, j) = 0 otherwise.\nThen it is well known that the operator \u0393(n) : ln2 \u2192 ln2 satisfies\nk\u0393(n)k \u2264 C\n\nand k\u0393(n)kreg \u2264 Clog(n + 1)\n\nfor some constant C (independent of n). Thus, for any Banach space X, we have\nk\u0393(n)X k \u2264 Clog(n + 1)\u2206X ((log(n + 1))\u22121 ).\nTherefore, we find\nX\n\nuniformly curved \u21d2 k\u0393(n)X k \u2208 o(log(n)).\n\nAs observed in [57], this implies that X is super-reflexive and hence, by Enflo's theorem [19],\nisomorphic to a uniformly convex space.\nIt is natural to wonder about the converse:\nProblem 2.4. Is is true that\nuniformly convex \u21d2 curved or fully curved ?\nIt is true that\nsuper-reflexive \u21d2 uniformly curved ?\nNote that, as already mentioned, \"uniformly curved\" is obviously stable under isomorphism, while\nthis is obviously false for \"curved\" spaces.\n14\n\n\f3\n\nRemarks on expanding graphs\n\nMany interesting examples of regular operators with regular norm 1 and small norm on L2 can be\nfound in the theory of contractive semi-groups on Lp (e.g. those generated by the Laplacian on a\nRiemannian manifold) or in that of random walks on groups. In this section, we illustrate this by\ncombinatorial Laplacians on expanding graphs (cf. e.g. [45]).\nWe refer the reader to the web site http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/\u223cmatousek/metrop.ps for a list of\nproblems (in particular Linial's contribution) related to this section. See also [53] for a similar\ntheme.\nLet G be a finite set equipped with a graph structure, so that G is the vertex set and we give\nourselves a symmetric set of edges E \u2282 G \u00d7 G.\nWe assume the graph G k-regular, i.e. such that for each x there are precisely k vertices y such\nthat (x, y) \u2208 E. Let MG : l2 (G) \u2192 l2 (G) be the \"Markov operator\" defined by\nM G f (x) =\n\n\u2200f \u2208 l2 (G)\n\n1 X\nf (y).\nk\n(x,y)\u2208E\n\nFor simplicity, we consider only non-bipartite graphs (equivalently \u2212k is not an eigenvalue of M G ).\nLet Ef denote the average of f over G, i.e.\nX\nf (y)\n\u2200f \u2208 l2 (G)\nEf (x) = |G|\u22121\ny\u2208G\n\nand let\nl02 (G) = {f \u2208 l2 (G) | Ef = 0}.\nWe set\n\u03b5(G) = kM G |l02 (G) k\nso that \u03b5(G) is the smallest constant such that\nkM G f \u2212 Ef k2 \u2264 \u03b5(G)kf k2 .\n\n\u2200f \u2208 l2 (G)\n\nA sequence of k-regular graphs {G(m)} is called expanding if sup \u03b5(G(m)) < 1 and |G(m)| \u2192 \u221e\nm\n\nwhen m \u2192 \u221e. In connection with the Baum\u2013Connes conjecture (see [24, 70, 37]) it is of interest\nto understand in which Banach spaces X we can embed coarsely, but uniformly over m, such a\nsequence {G(m)} viewed as a sequence of metric spaces.\nMore precisely, we will say that {G(m)} uniformly coarsely embeds in X if there are a function\n\u03c1 : R+ \u2192 R+ such that lim \u03c1(r) = \u221e and mappings fm : G(m) \u2192 X such that\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n(3.1)\n\n\u2200x, y \u2208 G(m)\n\n\u03c1(d(x, y)) \u2264 kfm (x) \u2212 fm (y)k \u2264 d(x, y).\n\nHere d(x, y) denotes the geodesic distance on the graph. This notion is due to Gromov (see [24, p.\n211], where it is called \"uniform embedding\").\nGiven a Banach space X, let us denote by \u03b5(G, X) the X-valued\nversion of \u03b5(G, X), i.e. the\nP\nsmallest \u03b5 such that for any f : G \u2192 X with mean zero (i.e.\nf (x) = 0) we have\nkM G f \u2212 Ef kl2 (X) \u2264 \u03b5kf kl2 (X) ,\n\nwhere M G and E are defined as before but now for X-valued functions on G.\n15\n\n\fBy a well known argument, it can be shown that if supm \u03b5(G(m), X) < 1, then X cannot contain\n{G(m)} uniformly coarsely. This is the motivation behind V. Lafforgue's question mentioned above.\nTo explain this, consider again a finite k-regular graph G as before. Let \u03b5 = \u03b5(G, X). Assume\nthat \u03b5 < 1. Assume that there is n \u2265 1 such that \u03b4 = 2\u2206X (\u03b5n /2) < 1. We have then for any\nf: G\u00d7G \u2192X\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f61/2\nX\n\uf8ed|G|\u22121\nkf (x) \u2212 f (y)k2 \uf8f8 \u2264 2(1 \u2212 \u03b4)\u22121 kf \u2212 (M G )n f kl2 (X) .\n(3.2)\n(x,y)\u2208G2\n\nIndeed, for any n \u2265 1 we have k(M G \u2212 E)n (1\u2212 E)kB(l2 (G)) \u2264 \u03b5n but also (note M G E = EM G = E)\n(M G \u2212 E)n (1 \u2212 E) = (M G )n (1 \u2212 E) = (M G )n \u2212 E\nand hence (since kM G kreg and kEkreg are \u2264 1)\nk(M G \u2212 E)n (1 \u2212 E)kreg \u2264 2.\nTherefore\nk(M G )n \u2212 EkB(l2 (G;X)) \u2264 2\u2206X (\u03b5n /2) = \u03b4,\nand hence for any f : G \u2192 X\nkf \u2212 Ef kl2 (X) \u2264 kf \u2212 (M G )n f kl2 (X) + k(M G )n f \u2212 Ef kl2 (X)\n\u2264 kf \u2212 (M G )n f kl2 (X) + \u03b4kf \u2212 Ef kl2 (X)\n\nfrom which (3.2) follows immediately, using the following classical and elementary inequality\n\uf8f61/2\n\uf8eb\n!1/2\nX\nX\n\uf8ed|G|\u22122\n.\nkf (x) \u2212 Ef k2\nkf (x) \u2212 f (y)k2 \uf8f8 \u2264 2 |G|\u22121\n(3.3)\nx\u2208G\n\n(x,y)\u2208G\u00d7G\n\nWe now show that (3.2) is an obstruction to (3.1). Indeed, since kfm (x) \u2212 fm (y)k \u2264 1 if (x, y) \u2208 E\nwe find easily\nkfm \u2212 (M G )n fm kl2 (X) \u2264 |G|1/2 n\nbut also for any R > 0 if we set\nER (m) = {(x, y) \u2208 G(m)2 | d(x, y) \u2265 R},\nsince kf (x) \u2212 f (y)k \u2265 \u03c1(R) for any (x, y) in ER , we find\n\u0012\n\u0013\n|ER (m)| 1/2\n\u03c1(R)\n\u2264 2(1 \u2212 \u03b4)\u22121 n.\n|G(m)|2\nBut now, since |G(m)| \u2192 \u221e, for each fixed R we have\n|G(m)|\u22122 |ER (m)| \u2192 1\nand hence we obtain\n\u03c1(R) \u2264 2(1 \u2212 \u03b4)\u22121 n\nwhich contradicts the assumption that \u03c1(R) is unbounded when R \u2192 \u221e. Thus we obtain (as\nobserved by V. Lafforgue):\n16\n\n\fProposition. If X is uniformly curved, X cannot contain uniformly coarsely an expanding sequence.\nProof. Indeed, if \u03b5 = sup \u03b5(G(m)) < 1 and X is uniformly curved, then 2\u2206X (\u03b5n /2) \u2192 0 when\nm\n\nn \u2192 \u221e so we can always choose n so that \u03b4 < 1.\n\nIn [43], in answer to a question of Naor, V. Lafforgue shows that certain specific expanding\nsequences do not embed uniformly coarsely even in any Banach space with non trivial type. This is\na stronger statement than the preceding one, since the class of spaces with non trivial type is strictly\nlarger than that of uniformly curved spaces (because uniformly curved implies super-reflexive), but\nso far this is known only for special expanding sequences. For example it is not known either for\nthe expanding sequence derived from a finite set of generators and the family of finite quotient\ngroups of SL3 (Z), or for the \"Ramanujan graph\" expanding sequences (see [45]).\nProblem 3.1. Characterize the Banach spaces X for which there is a function d : (0, 1] \u2192 [0, 2],\nwith d(\u03b5) tending to zero when \u03b5 \u2192 0, such that for any finite graph G as above we have\n\u03b5(G, X) \u2264 d(\u03b5(G)).\nSee [44] for related results.\nRemark. Note that (3.2) implies that there is a constant C such that\n\n(3.4)\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed|G|\u22121\n\nX\n\n(x,y)\u2208G2\n\n\uf8f61/2\n\nkf (x) \u2212 f (y)k2 \uf8f8\n\n\u2264 Ckf \u2212 (M G )f kl2 (X) .\n\nPn\u22121\nIndeed, since we have kf \u2212 (M G )n f k \u2264 k=0\nk(M G )k (f \u2212 (M G )f )k we can take C = 2n(1 \u2212 \u03b4)\u22121 .\nA fortiori this implies\nX\n(3.5)\n|G|\u22122\nkf (x) \u2212 f (y)k \u2264 C sup {kf (x) \u2212 f (y)k}.\nd(x,y)=1\n\n(x,y)\u2208G2\n\nThe preceding (well known) argument clearly shows that X cannot contain uniformly coarsely an\nexpanding sequence if it satisfies (3.5) with the same C when G runs over that sequence. However,\nit may be that (3.5) is satisfied by a much larger class of spaces than those of non trivial type.\nIndeed, it is an open problem whether any space with nontrivial cotype satisfies (3.5) with a fixed\nconstant C valid for any G running in a given expanding sequence. This would show that finite\ncotype is an obstruction to containing uniformly coarsely an expanding sequence. Note that the\nmetric space l1 with metric (x, y) 7\u2192 kx \u2212 yk1/2 embeds isometrically into Hilbert space and hence\ndoes not contain uniformly coarsely an expanding sequence (see [47]). More generally, see the\nappendix of [52] for the case of Banach lattices of finite cotype, or spaces with a unit ball uniformly\nhomeomorphic to a subset of l2 .\nWe refer to [49] for a discussion of type and cotype and to [51, 48] for a survey of recent work\non coarse embeddability between Banach spaces.\n\n4\n\nA duality operators/classes of Banach spaces\n\nIn this section, we describe a \"duality\" (or a \"polarity\") between classes of Banach spaces on one\nhand and classes of operators on Lp on the other hand. The general ideas underlying this are\n17\n\n\falready implicitly in Kwapi\u00e9n's remarkable papers [40, 41] and Roberto Hernandez's thesis (cf.\n[29]). See also [31, 8, 9, 77]. In connection with the notion of p-complete boundedness from [60],\nwe refer the interested reader to [35, Th 1.2.3.7 and Cor. 1.2.4.7] for an even more general duality.\nWe seize the occasion to develop this theme more explicitly in this paper.\nFix 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e. Consider a class of operators C acting between Lp -spaces. A typical element of\nC is a (bounded) operator T : Lp (\u03bc) \u2192 Lp (\u03bc\u2032 ) where (\u03a9, A, \u03bc) and (\u03a9\u2032 , A\u2032 , \u03bc\u2032 ) are measure spaces.\nWe can associate to C the class C \u25e6 of all Banach spaces X such that TX : Lp (\u03bc; X) \u2192 Lp (\u03bc\u2032 ; X) is\nbounded for any T in C (as above).\nConversely, given a class B of Banach spaces, we associate to it the class B \u25e6 of all operators\nT between two Lp -spaces (as above) such that TX is bounded for any X in B. This immediately\nraises two interesting problems (the second one is essentially solved by Theorem 4.5 below):\nProblem 4.1. Characterize C \u25e6\u25e6 .\nProblem 4.2. Characterize B \u25e6\u25e6 .\n\n4.1\nOne can also formulate an isometric variant of these problems: one defines C \u25e6 (resp. B \u25e6 ) as those\nX's (resp. those T 's) such that kTX k = kT k for all T in C (resp. for all X in B). In particular:\nProblem 4.3. Given an n \u00d7 n matrix a = [aij ] of norm 1 when acting on the n-dimensional\nEuclidean space ln2 , characterize the class {a}\u25e6\u25e6 , i.e. the class of all n \u00d7 n matrices b = [bij ] such\nthat kbX k \u2264 1 for all X such that kaX k \u2264 1.\nRemark 4.4. Note that for any C, the class of all X such that kTX k \u2264 1 for all T in C is stable under\nultraproducts and lp -sums. Moreover, if X belongs to the class, all subspaces and all quotients of\nX also do.\n\n4.2\nWe should immediately point out that the extreme cases p = 1 and p = \u221e are trivial: In that case,\nC \u25e6 always contains all Banach spaces and B \u25e6 all operators. In the isometric variant the same is\ntrue.\nIn what precedes, we have allowed \u03bc and \u03bc\u2032 to vary. If we now fix \u03bc and \u03bc\u2032 and consider\nC \u2282 B(Lp (\u03bc), Lp (\u03bc\u2032 )) we can define C \u25e6\u25e6 as the class of those T in B(Lp (\u03bc), Lp (\u03bc\u2032 )) such that TX is\nbounded for all X in C \u25e6 . In this framework, Problem 4.1 is somewhat more natural.\nNevertheless, in both forms, very little is known about Problem 4.1 except some special cases\nas follows:\n\n4.3\nIf C is the class of all bounded operators between Lp -spaces, it is trivial that C = C \u25e6\u25e6 .\n\n4.4\nIf p = 2 and C = {F} where F denotes the Fourier transform acting on L2 either on Z, T or R then\nC \u25e6\u25e6 is the class of all bounded operators between L2 -spaces. In the isometric variant, the same\nholds. This is due to Kwapi\u00e9n [40].\n\n18\n\n\f4.5\nThe preceding can also be reformulated in terms of type 2 and cotype 2 (see [49] for these notions),\nusing \u03a9 = {\u22121, 1}N equipped with its usual probability measure \u03bc and denoting by (\u03b5n ) the\ncoordinates on \u03a9. Let T1 : l2 \u2192 L2 (\u03a9,\n\u03bc) \u2192 l2 ) be the linear contractions\nR \u03bc) (resp. T2 : L2 (\u03a9,\n\u25e6\ndefined by T1 en = \u03b5n and T2 f = \u03a3en f \u03b5n d\u03bc. Then {T1 } (resp. {T2 }\u25e6 ) is the class of Banach\nspaces X of type 2 (resp. such that X \u2217 is of type 2). Therefore, {T1 , T2 }\u25e6 is the class of X such that\nX and its dual are of type 2, i.e. are Hilbertian, and hence {T1 , T2 }\u25e6\u25e6 is the class of all bounded\noperators between L2 -spaces.\n\n4.6\nIf (\u03a9, \u03bc) is as in 4.5, let P : L2 (\u03bc) \u2192 L2 (\u03bc) denote the orthogonal projection onto the closed span\nof the sequence of coordinate functions {\u03b5n }. Then {P }\u25e6 is the class of the so-called K-convex\nspaces, that coincides with the class of spaces that are of type p for some p > 1, or equivalently do\nnot contain ln1 's uniformly (see [49] for all this).\nBourgain's papers [4, 5, 6] on the Hausdorff-Young inequality in the Banach space valued case\nare also somewhat related to the same theme.\n\n4.7\nIf C = {T } where T is the Hilbert transform on Lp (T) (or Lp (R)), then C \u25e6\u25e6 contains all martingale\ntransforms and a number of Fourier multipliers of H\u00f6rmander type. This is due to Bourgain [3].\nConversely if C is the class of all martingale transforms, then it was known before Bourgain's paper\nthat C \u25e6\u25e6 contains the Hilbert transform and various singular integrals. This is due to Burkholder\nand McConnell (cf. [11, 10]). This leaves entirely open many interesting questions. For instance,\nit would be nice (perhaps not so hopeless ?) to have a description of {T }\u25e6\u25e6 when T is the Hilbert\ntransform on Lp (T), say for p = 2. See [20, 55] for results in this direction.\n\n4.8\nIn sharp contrast, Problem 4.2 is in some sense already solved by the following theorem of Hernandez\n[29], extending Kwapi\u00e9n's ideas in [41]. Kwapie\u0144 proved that a Banach space X is C-isomorphic\nto a subquotient of Lp iff kTX k \u2264 CkT k for any operator on Lp . In particular, with the notation in\nProblem 4.1, taking C = 1, this says that if C is the class of all operators on Lp , and B is reduced\nto the single space C, so that C = B \u25e6 then C \u25e6 = B \u25e6\u25e6 is the class of subquotients of Lp .\nTheorem 4.5 ([29]). With the above notation, B \u25e6\u25e6 is the class of all subspaces of quotients of\nultraproducts\n\u0013 of direct sums in the lp -sense of finite families of spaces of B, i.e. spaces of the form\n\u0012\nP\nwith Xi \u2208 B for all i in a finite set I.\nXi\n\u2295\ni\u2208I\n\np\n\nNote that for p = 1 (resp. p = \u221e) every Banach space is a quotient of l1 (resp. a subspace of\nl\u221e ), so we obtain all Banach spaces, in agreement with 4.2 above.\nTo abbreviate, from now on we will say \"subquotient\" instead of subspace of a quotient. Note\nthe following elementary fact: the class of all subquotients of a Banach space X is identical to the\nclass of all quotient spaces of a subspace of X. Therefore there is no need to further iterate passage\nto subspaces and quotients.\nThe isomorphic version is as follows:\n\n19\n\n\fTheorem 4.6 ([29]). Let C \u2265 1 be a constant. The following properties of a Banach space X are\nequivalent:\n(i) X is C-isomorphic to a subquotient of an ultraproduct\nof \u0013\ndirect sums in the lp -sense of finite\n\u0012\nP\nXi\nfamilies of spaces of B, i.e. spaces of the form \u2295\nwith Xi \u2208 B for all i in a finite\ni\u2208I\n\nset I.\n\np\n\n(ii) kTX k \u2264 C for any n and any T : lnp \u2192 lnp such that sup{kTY k | Y \u2208 B} \u2264 1.\nSince the detailed proof in [30] might be difficult to access, we decided to outline one here.\nFirst part of Proof of Theorem 4.6. (i) \u21d2 (ii) is obvious. Assume (ii). Since B is stable by lp -sums\nwe may reduce\nto the case when B is reduced to a single space, that is to say B = {lp (X )}, (just take\nP\nY )p ). Then since X embeds isometrically into an ultraproduct of its finite dimensional\nX = (\u2295\nY \u2208B\n\nsubspaces and since (ii) is inherited by all finite dimensional subspaces of X, we may reduce the\nproof of (ii) \u21d2 (i) to the case when dim(X) < \u221e. Thus we assume that dim(X) < \u221e. Fix \u03b5 > 0.\nThere is an integer N and an embedding J1 : X \u2192 lN\n\u221e such that\n(4.1)\n\n\u2200x \u2208 X\n\nkxk(1 + \u03b5)\u22121 \u2264 kJ1 xk \u2264 kxk.\n\n\u2200\u03be \u2208 X \u2217\n\nk\u03bek(1 + \u03b5)\u22121 \u2264 kJ2 \u03bek \u2264 k\u03bek.\n\nSimilarly there is (for N large enough) an embedding J2 : X \u2217 \u2192 lN\n\u221e such that\n(4.2)\n\nN\nLet u = J1 J2\u2217 : lN\n1 \u2192 l\u221e . Note kuk \u2264 kJ1 kkJ2 k \u2264 1. Then we easily deduce from (ii) that for all\nn and all T : lnp \u2192 lnp we have\nn N\nkT \u2297 u : lnp (lN\n1 ) \u2192 lp (l\u221e )k \u2264 CkTX k.\n\nThe proof will be completed easily using the next Lemma.\nN\nLemma 4.7.

Indeed, the left hand side is equal to sup{|hu, vi|\nand the right hand side to \u03b3B (u) with B = {lp (X )}.\n\n\u03b3B\u2217 (v) \u2264 1}\n\nN\nProof of Theorem 4.6. By Lemma 4.7 applied to u = J1 J2\u2217 : lN\n1 \u2192 l\u221e we have \u03b3B (u) \u2264 C. Assume for simplicity \u03b3B (u) < C. Then, for some integer n, we have a factorization u = \u03b1\u03b2 with\nn\nN\nn\n\u03b1 : lnp (X ) \u2192 lN\n\u221e and \u03b2 : l1 \u2192 lp (X ) such that k\u03b1kk\u03b2k < C. Let S \u2282 lp (X ) be the range of \u03b2 and\nlet S0 \u2282 S be the kernel of \u03b1|S . Let q : S \u2192 S/S0 denote the quotient map and let \u03b1\u0303 : S/S0 \u2192 lN\n\u221e\nN\nbe the map defined by \u03b1|S = \u03b1\u0303q. Also let \u03b2\u0303 : l1 \u2192 S/S0 be defined by \u03b2\u0303(*) = q\u03b2(*). We have then\nu = J1 J2\u2217 = \u03b1\u0303\u03b2\u0303. But now \u03b1\u0303 is injective and \u03b2\u0303 surjective. Consider the mapping w : S/S0 \u2192 X\ndefined by w(*) = J1\u22121 \u03b1\u0303(*). Recalling (4.1) we find kwk \u2264 (1 + \u03b5)k\u03b1\u0303k \u2264 (1 + \u03b5)k\u03b1k. Moreover, for\nN\n\u2217\nany x in X since J2\u2217 : lN\n1 \u2192 X is onto, there is y in l1 such that J2 y = x, so that w is invertible\nand we have w\u22121 x = \u03b2\u0303y. Recalling (4.2) again this gives us kw\u22121 k \u2264 k\u03b2\u0303k(1 + \u03b5) \u2264 k\u03b2k(1 + \u03b5). Thus\nwe conclude kwkkw\u22121 k \u2264 (1 + \u03b5)2 |\u03b1kk\u03b2k \u2264 C(1 + \u03b5)2 . This shows that X is C(1 + \u03b5)2 -isomorphic\nto S/S0 . Letting \u03b5 \u2192 0, we find that X is C-isomorphic to an ultraproduct of spaces of the form\nS/S0 , i.e. of subquotients of lnp (X ) (n \u2265 1).\n\n22\n\n\f4.9\nActually, Hernandez considers more generally (instead of an identity operator) bounded linear\nmaps u : Z \u2192 Y between Banach spaces that factor through a space X that is a subquotient of an\nultraproduct of the spaces described in Theorem 4.6 above and defines\n\u03b3SQB (u) = inf{ku1 kku2 k}\nwhere the infimum runs over all u2 : Z \u2192 X and u1 : X \u2192 Y such that u = u1 u2 and over all\nsuch spaces X. In this broader framework, he shows that\n\u03b3SQB (u) = sup{kT \u2297 u : Lp (Z) \u2192 Lp (Y )k}\nwhere the supremum runs over all T : Lp \u2192 Lp (or T : lnp \u2192 lnp ) such that kTX k \u2264 1 for any X in\nB.\nIn this framework, the \"duality\" we are interested in becomes more transparent: given a class C\nof operators, say, from Lp (\u03bc) to Lp (\u03bc\u2032 ), we may introduce the dual class C \u2020 formed of all operators\nu : Z \u2192 Y between Banach spaces such\n\u2200T \u2208 C\n\nkT \u2297 u : Lp (Z) \u2192 Lp (Y )k \u2264 1.\n\nSimilarly, given a class B of operators u, we may introduce the dual class B \u2020 formed of all T such\nthat\n\u2200u \u2208 B kT \u2297 u : Lp (Z) \u2192 Lp (Y )k \u2264 1.\nHere again, one can replace 1 by a fixed constant to treat the \"isomorphic\" (as opposed to isometric)\nvariant of this.\n\n4.10\nMore generally, let 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e. We recall for future reference that if B is a (non-void) class of\nBanach spaces that is stable under lp -sums (i.e. X, Y \u2208 B \u21d2 X \u2295p Y \u2208 B) then the \"norm\" of\nfactorization through a space belonging to B is indeed a norm. More precisely, let us define for any\noperator u : E \u2192 F acting between Banach spaces the norm\n\u03b3B (u) = inf{ku1 kku2 k}\nu\n\nu\n\n2\n1\nwhere the infimum runs over all X in B and all factorizations E \u2212\u2192\nX \u2212\u2192\nF . Let \u0393B (E, F ) denote\nthe space of those u that admit such a factorization. Then \u0393B (E, F ) is a vector space and \u03b3B is a\nnorm on it. See [41, 56] for details.\n\n4.11\nNote that kuk \u2264 \u03b3B (u) and equality holds if u has rank 1. Therefore we have for all u : E \u2192 F\nkuk \u2264 \u03b3B (u) \u2264 N (u).\n\n23\n\n\f5\n\nComplex interpolation of families of Banach spaces\n\nLet D = {z \u2208 C | |z| < 1}. Consider a measurable family {k kz } of norms on Cn indexed by\nz \u2208 \u2202D. By measurable, we mean that z \u2192 kxkz is measurable for any x in Cn . We will need to\nassume that there are positive functions k1 > 0 and k2 > 0 such that their logarithms are in L1 (m)\non \u2202D equipped with its normalized Lebesgue measure m, and satisfying\n\u2200z \u2208 \u2202D \u2200x \u2208 Cn\n\n(5.1)\n\nk1 (z)kxk \u2264 kxkz \u2264 k2 (z)kxk,\n\nwhere kxk denotes the Euclidean norm of x (here any fixed norm would do just as well), sometimes\ndenoted also below by kxkln2 .\nLet X(z) = (Cn , k kz ). Following [15] we say that {X(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} is a compatible family of\nBanach spaces. When this holds for constant functions k1 > 0 and k2 > 0, we will say that the\nfamily is strongly compatible.\nBy [15] (see also [13, 14, 16, 73]), the complex interpolation method can be extended to this\nsetting and produces a family {X(z) | z \u2208 D} of which the original family appears as boundary\nvalues in a suitable sense (see also [67, 68, 69, 31] for further developments).\nWe need to recall how the space X(0) is defined (cf. [13, 14]). Let Wj be an outer function\non D admitting kj as its boundary values (recall that Wj = exp(uj + i\u0169j ) where uj is the Poisson\np\nintegral of logkj ). Let 0 < p \u2264 \u221e. We define the space H#\nas formed of all analytic functions\nn\np (D, Cn ) with boundary values such\nf such that W1 f is in the classical C -valued Hardy\nspace\nH\nR\nthat z \u2192 kf (z)kz is in Lp (m). We set kf kH p = ( kf (z)kpz dm(z))1/p , with the usual convention\n#\n\nfor p = \u221e. Then\n(5.2)\n\n\u2200x \u2208 Cn\n\n\u2202D\n\nkxkX(0) = inf{kf kH#\u221e }\n\n\u221e such that f (0) = x. Although it appears so at first glance,\nwhere the infimum runs over all f in H#\nthis definition does not depend on the choice of k1 as long as we choose k1 > 0 such that logk1 is\nin L1 (this can be verified using (5.8) below).\nAn equivalent definition which makes this clear is as follows (see below for more on N + ):\n\n(5.3)\n\nkxkX(0) = inf{ess sup kf (z)kz }\n\nn ) such that f (0) = x. The latter\nwhere the infimum runs over all functions f in the class N + (D, CP\n+\nn\nclass N (D, C ) is defined as that of all f of the form f (z) = k1 fj xj with xj \u2208 Cn , fj \u2208 N +\n(k \u2265 1) .\nWe now give some useful background on the Nevanlinna class N + (see [17,\nR p. 25] and [71, \u00a74]).\nThe class N + is the set of all analytic functions f : D \u2192 C such that sup log+ |f (rz)| dm(z) <\nr<1\n\n\u221e (i.e. f \u2208 N ) and moreover such that, when r \u2192 1\nZ\nZ\n+\nlog |f (rz)| dm(z) \u2192 log+ |f (z)| dm(z),\n\nwhere (f (z))z\u2208\u2202D denote the non-tangential limit of f (which exists a.e. as soon as f \u2208 N ). Let\nfr (z) = f (rz). Equivalently, assuming f 6\u2261 0, f \u2208 N + iff the family {log+ |fr | | 0 < r < 1} is\nuniformly integrable on the unit circle (see [71, p.65-66] for this specific fact). In that case, we have\nZ\nlog |f (z)|d\u03bc\u03be (z)\n\u2200\u03be \u2208 D\nlog |f (\u03be)| \u2264\n\u2202D\n\n24\n\n\fwhere \u03bc\u03be denotes the harmonic probability mesure on \u2202D for the point \u03be \u2208 D. Equivalently \u03bc\u03be is\nthe probability on \u2202D admitting the Poisson kernel of \u03be as density relative to Lebesgue measure.\nMore explicitly if\n\u03be = reit0 z = eit\n(0 < r < \u221e, t0 , t \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0])\nthen we have\n(5.4)\n\nd\u03bc\u03be (z) =\n\n1 \u2212 |\u03be|2\n1 \u2212 r2\ndt\n.\ndm(z)\n=\n2\n2\n|z \u2212 \u03be|\n1 \u2212 2r cos(t \u2212 t0 ) + r 2\u03c0\n\nMore generally, for any norm on Cn (writing the norm as a sup of linear functionals) and any\nf in N + (D, Cn ), we have\nZ\nlog kf (z)kd\u03bc\u03be (z).\n(5.5)\n\u2200\u03be \u2208 D\nlog kf (\u03be)k \u2264\n\u2202D\n\nand hence\n(5.6)\n\n\u2200\u03be \u2208 D\n\nkf (\u03be)k \u2264 ess sup kf (z)k.\n\u2202D\n\nIt is known that N + is a vector space and even an algebra (see [71, p.65-66]) and H p \u2282 N + \u2282 N\nfor any 0 < p \u2264 \u221e. Clearly, these inclusions remain valid for the corresponding spaces of Cn -valued\nfunctions, denoted by H p (D, Cn ), N + (D, Cn ), N (D, Cn ). In particular, we have (note that W1 and\n\u221e \u2282 N + (D, Cn ).\nits inverse are in N + ) H#\nWe will need several basic properties of the interpolation spaces.\n\n5.1\nAssume that the family {X(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} takes only two values, i.e. we have a pair (X0 , X1 ) and\na measurable partition \u2202D = \u22020 \u222a \u22021 such that X(z) = X0 when z \u2208 \u22020 and X(z) = X1 when\nz \u2208 \u22021 . Let \u03b8 denote the normalized Haar measure of \u22021 . Then we recover the classical (Calder\u00f3nLions) complex interpolation space (X0 , X1 )\u03b8 . Indeed, it is proved in [15, Cor. 5.1] that the family\n{X(z) | z \u2208 D} that extends and interpolates the data on \u2202D, is simply the one given by setting\nX(z) = (X0 , X1 )\u03b8(z)\nwhere, for any z inside D, \u03b8(z) is defined as the harmonic extension inside D of the indicator\nfunction of \u22021 . In particular, since \u03b8(0) = \u03b8, we have (isometrically)\nX(0) = (X0 , X1 )\u03b8 .\n\n5.2\n\u221e , or in N + (D, Cn ), and any \u03be \u2208 D we have\nFor any analytic function f in H#\n\nlog kf (\u03be)kX(\u03be) \u2264\n\nZ\n\n\u2202D\n\nlog kf (z)kX(z) d\u03bc\u03be (z),\n\nand the function \u03be 7\u2192 log kf (\u03be)kX(\u03be) is subharmonic in D.

More precisely, if we set Y (z) = X(z)\u2217 (note that this is still\ncompatible), then we have\nX(0)\u2217 = Y (0) isometrically.\n\n5.3\nThe fundamental interpolation principle for families (inspired by Elias Stein's classical result) takes\nthe following form: Let z 7\u2192 T (z) be a function in N + with values in the normed space B(Cn ) of\nlinear mappings on (Cn , k * k). Then\nZ\n(5.9)\nlog kT (0)kB(X(0)) \u2264 log kT (z)kB(X(z)) dm(z).\nIndeed, for any f \u2208 N + (D, Cn ), the function z 7\u2192 T (z)f (z) is in N + (D, Cn ), and hence if f (0) = x\nwe deduce from (5.7)\nZ\nZ\nlog kT (z)kX(z) dm(z) + log kf kH#\u221e ,\nlog kT (z)f (z)kX(z) dm(z) \u2264\nlog kT (0)xkX(0) \u2264\n\u2202D\n\n\u2202D\n\nfrom which (5.9) is immediate.\n\n5.4\nLet z \u2192 \u03b3(z) > 0 be a positive function on \u2202D such that log\u03b3 is in L1 (m). Then there is an outer\nfunction F on D in the Nevanlinna class N + admitting \u03b3 as (nontangential) boundary values. Let\n{X(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} be a compatible family, with norms k kz .

F = W2\u22121 ) in 5.4.\n\n5.6\nWe will say that two compatible families {X(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} and {Y (z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} of n-dimensional\nspaces are \"equivalent\" if there is an invertible analytic function F : D \u2192 Mn in the Nevanlinna\nclass N + (i.e. with each entry in N + ) such that\n\u2200z \u2208 \u2202D\n\nkF (z)xkY (z) = kxkX(z) .\n\nHere, \"invertible\" means that F (z) is invertible for all z in D, and that z \u2192 F (z)\u22121 is also in N + .\nRecall that N + is an algebra. Then, using (5.3), we have clearly: X(0) \u2243 Y (0) isometrically and\nF (0) : X(0) \u2192 Y (0) is an isometric isomorphism.\nThe following lemma shows that on the subset C \u2282 \u2202D where X(z) is Hilbertian, we may\nassume after passing to an equivalent family that X(z) = ln2 for (almost) all z in C.\nLemma 5.1. Any compatible family {X(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} of n-dimensional Banach spaces is equivalent\nto a family {Y (z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} such that\nY (z) = ln2\nfor (almost) all z such that X(z) is Hilbertian.\nProof. By 5.5, we may assume that the compatibility condition has the form k1 kxk \u2264 kxkX(z) \u2264 kxk\n\u2200x \u2208 Cn , with logk1 in L1 .\nLet C \u2282 \u2202D be the set of z's such that X(z) is (isometrically) Hilbertian. Then there is clearly\na measurable function \u03c6 : C \u2192 (Mn )+ such that\nkxk2X(z) = h\u03c6(z)x, xi\n\n\u2200x \u2208 Cn\n\nwhere h*, *i is the usual scalar product in Cn . Let us extend \u03c6 arbitrarily outside C, say by setting\n\u03c6(z) = I for all z outside C. By the compatibility assumption, we have clearly k1 (*)I \u2264 \u03c6(*) \u2264 I. By\nthe classical matricial Szeg\u00f6 theorem (cf. e.g. [27]) there is a bounded outer function F : D \u2192 Mn\nsuch that |F (z)|2 = F (z)\u2217 F (z) = \u03c6(z) on \u2202D. We now define Y (z) by setting\nkxkY (z) = kF (z)\u22121 xkX(z) .\n\n\u2200x \u2208 Cn\nNote that for any z in C we have\n\nkxk2Y (z) = h\u03c6(z)F (z)\u22121 x, F (z)\u22121 xi = kxk2ln2 .\nThis proves the lemma.\n\n5.7\nLet {X(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} be a compatible family. Let k * k\u03be denote the norm in X(\u03be) (\u03be \u2208 D\u0304). For any\nCn -valued analytic function f on D, the function \u03be 7\u2192 log kf (\u03be)k\u03be is subharmonic in D. A fortiori,\nby Jensen, the function \u03be 7\u2192 kf (\u03be)k\u03be is subharmonic in D. Any norm valued function on D with\n\n27\n\n\fthis property is called subharmonic in [16]. Now suppose for any x \u2208 Cn the function x 7\u2192 kxkz is\ncontinuous and bounded on \u2202D. Then for any z \u2208 \u2202D and any x \u2208 Cn\nlim sup kxk\u03be \u2264 kxkz .\n\u03be\u2192z\n\nIt turns out that the norm valued function k * k\u03be is the largest among all the subharmonic ones on D\nsatisfying this. Coifman and Semmes [16, 73] used this characterization to develop an interpolation\nmethod on domains on Cd with d > 1. Independently Slodkowski [74, 75] introduced several new\ninterpolation methods. The possible consequences of these ideas for the geometry of Banach spaces\nhave yet to be investigated.\n\n6\n\n\u03b8 -Hilbertian spaces\n\nDefinition.\n\u2022 We will say that a finite dimensional Banach space X is \u03b8-Euclidean if X is\nisometric to the complex interpolation space X(0) associated to a compatible family {X(z) |\nz \u2208 \u2202D} of Banach spaces such that X(z) is Hilbertian for all z in a subset of \u2202D of\n(normalized) Haar measure \u2265 \u03b8.\n\u2022 If this holds simply for all z in J\u03b8 = {e2\u03c0it | 0 < t < \u03b8} then we say that X is arcwise\n\u03b8-Euclidean.\n\u2022 We will say that a Banach space is \u03b8-Hilbertian (resp. arcwise \u03b8-Hilbertian) if it is isometric\nto an ultraproduct of a family of \u03b8-Euclidean (resp. arcwise \u03b8-Euclidean) finite dimensional\nspaces.\nThe preceding terminology is different from the one in our previous paper [58]. There we called\n\u03b8-Hilbertian the Banach spaces that can be written as (X0 , X1 )\u03b8 for some interpolation pair of\nBanach spaces with X1 Hilbertian. We prefer to change this: we will call these spaces strictly\n\u03b8-Hilbertian.\nWe suspect that there are \u03b8-Hilbertian spaces that are not strictly \u03b8-Hilbertian (perhaps even\nnot quotients of subspaces of ultraproducts of strictly \u03b8-Hilbertian spaces), but we have no example\nyet. This amounts to show that in (6.5) below we cannot restrict X to be strictly \u03b8-Hilbertian.\nLet Z, Y be Banach spaces. Recall that we denote by \u0393H (Z, Y ) the set of operators u : Z \u2192 Y\nthat factorize through a Hilbert space, i.e. there are bounded operators u1 : H \u2192 Y , u2 : Z \u2192 H\nsuch that u = u1 u2 . We denote\n\u03b3H (u) = inf{ku1 k ku2 k}\nwhere the infimum runs over all such factorizations.\nSimilarly, we denote by \u0393\u03b8H (Z, Y ) (resp. \u0393\u03b8H(Z,Y\n) the set of T 's that factor through a \u03b8f\n)\nHilbertian space (resp. arcwise \u03b8-Hilbertian) and we denote\n\u03b3\u03b8H (u) = inf{ku1 kku2 k}\n\n(resp. \u03b3\u03b8H\nf (u) = inf{ku1 kku2 k)\n\nwhere the infimum runs over all factorizations u = u1 u2 with u1 : X \u2192 Y , u2 : Z \u2192 X and\nwith X \u03b8-Hilbertian (resp. arcwise \u03b8-Hilbertian). Note that, since \"\u03b8-Hilbertian\" (resp. arcwise\n\u03b8-Hilbertian) is stable under l2 -sums, this is a norm (see 4.10).\nLemma 6.1. Fix n \u2265 1 and 0 < \u03b8 < 1. Let E, F be n-dimensional Banach spaces. Then for any\nlinear map u : E \u2192 F we have\n\u03b3\u03b8H (u) \u2264 \u03b3\u03b8H\nf (u) \u2264 kuk(B(E,F ),\u0393H (E,F ))\u03b8 .\n28\n\n\fMore precisely, if kuk(B(E,F ),\u0393H (E,F ))\u03b8 \u2264 1 and if u is a linear isomorphism, then u admits a\nfactorization u = u1 u2 with ku2 : E \u2192 Xk \u2264 1 and ku1 : X \u2192 F k \u2264 1 where X = X(0) for a\ncompatible family {X(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} such that X(z) \u2243 ln2 \u2200z \u2208 J\u03b8 and X(z) \u2243 F \u2200z \u2208\n/ J\u03b8 . (We also\nn\nhave X = Y (0) for a family {Y (z)} such that Y (z) \u2243 l2 \u2200z \u2208 J\u03b8 and Y (z) \u2243 E \u2200z \u2208\n/ J\u03b8 .)\nProof. Since linear isomorphisms are dense in B(E, F ), it clearly suffices to prove the second (\"more\nprecise\") assertion. Assume kuk(B(E,F ),\u0393H (E,F ))\u03b8 \u2264 1. As is well known, by conformal equivalence,\nwe may use the unit disc instead of the strip to define complex interpolation. We have then\nu = u(0) for some function z 7\u2192 u(z) in H \u221e (D, B(E, F )) such that ess supz6\u2208J\u03b8 ku(z)kB(E,F ) \u2264 1\nand ess supz\u2208J\u03b8 ku(z)k\u0393H (E,F ) \u2264 1. Therefore, (using a measurable selection, see 1.9) we can find\nbounded measurable functions z \u2192 u2 (z) \u2208 B(E, ln2 ) and z \u2192 u1 (z) \u2208 B(ln2 , F ) such that u(z) =\nu1 (z)u2 (z) and ess supz\u2208J\u03b8 ku1 (z)k \u2264 1, ess supz\u2208J\u03b8 ku2 (z)k \u2264 1.\nWe may view our operators as n \u00d7 n matrices (with respect to fixed bases) and define their\ndeterminants as those of the corresponding matrices. Note that since z 7\u2192 det(u(z)) is analytic,\nbounded and non identically zero, we must have det(u(z)) 6= 0 a.e. on \u2202D and (by Jensen, see\ne.g. [17, 22]) log | det(u(z))| must be in L1 (\u2202D). Moreover, the classical formula for the inverse\nof a matrix shows (since u is bounded on D) that there is a constant c such that ku(z)\u22121 k \u2264\nc| det(u(z))|\u22121 a.e. on \u2202D. Therefore, if \u03c6(z) = ku(z)\u22121 k\u22121 , we have\nZ\nlog \u03c6 > \u2212\u221e\nD\n\nand since \u03c6(z) \u2264 ku(z)k, we obtain log \u03c6 \u2208 L1 (\u2202D). Note that we have\ndet(u(z)) = det(u1 (z)) det(u2 (z))\nand hence since u1 , u2 are bounded on \u2202D, there are constants c1 , c2 such that | det(u(z))| \u2264\ncj | det(uj (z))| a.e. on \u2202D for j = 1, 2. Thus letting \u03c6j = kuj (z)\u22121 k\u22121 , the same argument yields\nlog \u03c6j \u2208 L1 (\u2202D).\nWe then define for any x in E\n\u2200z 6\u2208 J\u03b8\n\n\u2200z \u2208 J\u03b8\n\nkxkX(z) = ku(z)xkF , kxkY (z) = kxkE\n\nkxkX(z) = kxkY (z) = ku2 (z)xkln2 .\n\nFrom the preceding observations on \u03c61 and \u03c62 it is easy to deduce that (5.1) holds with log(k1 )\nand log(k2 ) in L1 (\u2202D). Therefore (X(z)) and (Y (z)) are compatible families. Then \u2200z \u2208 \u2202D\nku(z)xkF \u2264 kxkX(z) \u2264 kxkE .\nBy consideration of the constant function equal to x we find\nkxkX(0) \u2264 kxkE .\n\u221e with f (0) = x we can write by (5.6)\nThen, for any analytic f : D \u2192 E in H#\n\nkuxkF = ku(0)f (0)kF \u2264 ess sup ku(z)f (z)kF \u2264 ess sup kf (z)kX(z) ,\nz\u2208\u2202D\n\nz\u2208\u2202D\n\nthus, taking the infimum over all possible f 's, we conclude\nkuxkF \u2264 kxkX(0) \u2264 kxkE .\nThis clearly shows that u factors through X(0) with constant of factorization \u2264 1. Similarly, u\nfactors through Y (0) with factorization constant \u2264 1.\n29\n\n\fTheorem 6.2. Let 0 < \u03b8 < 1. For any n \u2265 1 we have isometric identities\n(6.1)\n\nn n\n(B(ln1 , ln\u221e ), \u0393H (ln1 , ln\u221e ))\u03b8 = \u0393\u03b8H (ln1 , ln\u221e ) = \u0393\u03b8H\nf (l1 , l\u221e ).\n\nProof. Let u : ln1 \u2192 ln\u221e be such that \u03b3\u03b8H (u) < 1, i.e. there is X \u03b8-Hilbertian and u1 : X \u2192 ln\u221e ,\nu2 : ln1 \u2192 X with ku1 k < 1, ku2 k < 1 such that u = u1 u2 . By compactness, we may as well assume\nthat X is finite dimensional and \u03b8-Euclidean. Let then hj = u2 ej \u2208 X and ki = u\u22171 ei \u2208 X \u2217 . We\nhave uij = hki , hj i, and\nsup khj kX < 1,\nsup kki kX \u2217 < 1.\nWriting X = X(0) for a compatible family such that X(z) is Hilbertian on a set of measure \u2265 \u03b8\nwe find analytic functions hi (z), kj (z) in N + (D, Cn ) such that\ness supkki (z)k\u2217z < 1\n\ness supkhj (z)kz < 1,\n\nand hj (0) = hj , ki (0) = ki . This gives us a matrix valued function Fij (z) = hki (z), hj (z)i in N +\nwith associated operator F (z) : ln1 \u2192 ln\u221e such that \u03b3H (F ) < 1 on a set of measure \u2265 \u03b8 and kF k \u2264 1\notherwise. (Indeed, kF k = sup |Fij | \u2264 sup kki k\u2217z sup khj kz ). By 5.1, this shows that\nij\n\ni\n\nj\n\nkF (0)k(B(ln1 ,ln\u221e ),\u0393H (ln1 ,ln\u221e ))\u03b8 \u2264 1,\nand since F (0) = u, we have proved kuk(B(ln1 ,ln\u221e ),\u0393H (ln1 ,ln\u221e ))\u03b8 \u2264 \u03b3\u03b8H (u). Conversely, by Lemma 6.1,\nn n\nwe have \u03b3\u03b8H\nn\n. Since we have trivially \u03b3\u03b8H (u) \u2264 \u03b3\u03b8H\nf (u) \u2264 kuk(B(ln\nf (u), this proves\n1 ,l\u221e ),\u0393H (l1 ,l\u221e ))\u03b8\n(6.1).\nTo supplement the preceding result, the next proposition gives a simple description of the norm\nin the dual of the space (B(ln1 , ln\u221e ), \u0393H (ln1 , ln\u221e ))\u03b8 . By the duality property of complex interpolation\n(cf. [2, p. 98]) the latter space coincides isometrically with (B(ln1 , ln\u221e )\u2217 , \u0393H (ln1 , ln\u221e )\u2217 )\u03b8 . We will use\nthe classical duality between linear maps u : ln1 \u2192 ln\u221e and linear maps v : ln\u221e \u2192 ln1 defined by\nhv, ui = tr(uv) = tr(vu).\nWith this duality, it is classical (see \u00a71 above) that we have isometric identities\nB(ln1 , ln\u221e )\u2217 = N (ln\u221e , ln1 ) = ln1\n\n2\n\nand\n\u0393H (ln1 , ln\u221e )\u2217 = \u0393\u2217H (ln\u221e , ln1 )\n\u2217 (.) defined by (see 1.8)\nwhere \u0393\u2217H (ln\u221e , ln1 ) denotes B(ln\u221e , ln1 ) equipped with the norm \u03b3H\n\u001a\u0010X\n\u00111/2 \u001b\n\u00111/2\n\u0010X\n\u2217\n|\u03bcj |2\n|\u03bbi |2\nkakB(ln2 )\n\u03b3H\n(v) = inf\n\nwith the infimum running over all factorizations of v of the form\n(6.2)\n\n\u2200i, j = 1, . . . , n\n\nvij = \u03bbi aij \u03bcj .\n\nProposition 6.3. Fix n \u2265 1 and 0 < \u03b8 < 1. Consider v : ln\u221e \u2192 ln1 . Then v belongs to the\n(closed) unit ball of (N (ln\u221e , ln1 ), \u0393\u2217H (ln\u221e , ln1 ))\u03b8 iff there are \u03bb, \u03bc in the unit ball of ln2 and a with\nkak(Br (ln2 ),B(ln2 ))\u03b8 \u2264 1 such that vij = \u03bbi aij \u03bcj for all i, j = 1, . . . , n.\n30\n\n\fProof. We first prove the \"if part.\" Fix \u03bb, \u03bc in the unit ball of ln2 . By Proposition 1.2, the\nlinear mapping a \u2192 [\u03bbi aij \u03bcj ] has norm \u2264 1 simultaneously from Br (ln2 ) to N (ln\u221e , ln1 ) and from\nB(ln2 ) to \u0393\u2217H (ln\u221e , ln1 ). Therefore, by interpolation it also has norm \u2264 1 from (Br (ln2 ), B(ln2 ))\u03b8 to\n(N (ln\u221e , ln1 ), \u0393\u2217H (ln\u221e , ln1 ))\u03b8 . This proves the \"if part.\"\nConversely, assume that v is in the open unit ball of (N (ln\u221e , ln1 ), \u0393\u2217H (ln\u221e , ln1 ))\u03b8 .\nLet S = {z \u2208 C | 0 < Re(z) < 1} be the classical \"unit strip\", and let \u2202j = {z \u2208 C | Re(z) = j},\nj = 0, 1. By the definition of complex interpolation, by Proposition 1.2 and a routine measurable\nselection argument (see 1.9), we can write vij = vij (\u03b8) where vij (*) is a bounded analytic matrix\nvalued function defined on the strip S admitting a factorization of the form vij (z) = \u03bbi (z)aij (z)\u03bcj (z)\nwhere\no\nnX\nX\n|\u03bbj (z)|2 ,\n|\u03bcj (z)|2 < 1\ness sup max\nz\u2208\u22020 \u222a\u22021\n\ntogether with\n(6.3)\n\ness sup k(aij (z))kBr (ln2 ) < 1\nz\u2208\u22020\n\nand\n(6.4)\n\ness sup k(aij (z))kB(ln2 ) < 1.\nz\u2208\u22021\n\nReplacing \u03bbi (z) and \u03bcj (z) respectively by \u03b5 + |\u03bbi (z)| and \u03b5 + |\u03bcj (z)| with \u03b5 > 0 chosen small enough\nwe may as well assume that |\u03bbi (*)| and |\u03bcj (*)| are all bounded below. Then there are bounded outer\nfunctions Fi , Gj on S such that\n|Fi (z)| = |\u03bbi (z)|\n\nand\n\n|Gj (z)| = |\u03bcj (z)|.\n\nWe may without loss of generality (since the bounds (6.3), (6.4) are preserved in this change)\nassume that \u03bbi (z) = Fi (z) and Gj (z) = \u03bcj (z). But then\naij (z) = Fi (z)\u22121 vij (z)Gj (z)\u22121\nmust be analytic on S and hence by (6.3) and (6.4) we have\nk(aij (\u03b8))k(Br (ln2 ),B(ln2 ))\u03b8 \u2264 1.\nThus we obtain\nvij = \u03bbi aij \u03bcj\nwith \u03bbi = Fi (\u03b8), \u03bcj = Gj (\u03b8), aij = aij (\u03b8).\nNote that \u03bb, \u03bc are in the unit ball of ln2 by the maximum principle applied to (Fi ) and (Gj ).\nThis proves the \"only if part\" except that we replaced the closed unit ball by the open one. An\nelementary compactness argument completes the proof.\nThe main result of this section is perhaps the following.\nTheorem 6.4. Let H(\u03b8, n) be the set of n-dimensional arcwise \u03b8-Hilbertian Banach spaces. Let\n0 < \u03b8 < 1. Consider the complex interpolation space B(\u03b8, n) = (Br (ln2 ), B(ln2 ))\u03b8 . Then for any T\nin B(ln2 ) we have\n(6.5)\n\nkT kB(\u03b8,n) =\n\nsup\nX\u2208H(\u03b8,n)\n\nkTX kB(ln2 (X)) .\n\nMoreover, we will show that equality still holds if we restrict the supremum to those X that can be\n/ J\u03b8 ,\nwritten X = X(0) for a compatible family such that X(z) \u2243 ln2 \u2200z \u2208 J\u03b8 and X(z) \u2243 ln\u221e \u2200z \u2208\nwhere \u2243 means here isometric.\n31\n\n\fProof. On one hand, we have for any Banach space X\nkTX k \u2264 kT kBr (ln2 )\nand on the other hand if X is Hilbertian\nkTX k \u2264 kT kB(ln2 ) .\nTherefore, if X is arcwise \u03b8-Euclidean (resp. X \u2208 H(\u03b8, n)), the inequality kTX kB(ln2 (X)) \u2264 kT kB(\u03b8,n)\nis a direct consequence of the interpolation principle 5.3 (resp. and Remark 4.4). We skip the easy\ndetails.\nTo prove the converse, we will use duality. We claim that if \u03c6 in B(ln2 ) is in the open unit ball\nof B(\u03b8, n)\u2217 and is invertible, then there is a space X in H(\u03b8, n) such that\n(6.6)\n\n|\u03c6(T )| \u2264 kTX kB(ln2 (X))\n\nfor any T in B(ln2 ).\nThis obviously implies that the supremum of |\u03c6(T )| over such \u03c6's is \u2264\n\nsup\nX\u2208H(\u03b8,n)\n\nkTX k and hence,\n\nby Hahn\u2013Banach and the density of invertible matrices, equality follows in (6.5).\nWe now proceed to prove this claim. Let \u03c6 be as above. Note that (cf. [2, p. 98])\nB(\u03b8, n)\u2217 = (Br (ln2 )\u2217 , B(ln2 )\u2217 )\u03b8 .\n\n(6.7)\n\nThe norm in B(ln2 )\u2217 is of course the trace class norm.\nSince k\u03c6kB(\u03b8,n)\u2217 < 1, there is a bounded analytic function \u03c6 : S \u2192 Mn such that \u03c6(0) = \u03c6 and\nmax{ess sup k\u03c6(z)kBr (ln2 )\u2217 , ess sup k\u03c6(z)kB(ln2 )\u2217 } < 1.\nz\u2208\u22021\n\nz\u2208\u22020\n\nBy Proposition 1.3 and a routine measurable selection argument (see 1.9), we can find measurable\nfunctions \u03bb(z) and \u03bc(z) on \u2202S such that\no\nnX\nX\n|\u03bbi (z)|2 ,\n|\u03bcj (z)|2 < 1\n(6.8)\ness sup max\nz\u2208\u2202S\n\nand a measurable function v : z \u2192 B(ln1 , ln\u221e ) such that\n(6.9)\n\nmax{ess sup kv(z)kB(ln1 ,ln\u221e ) , ess sup kv(z)k\u0393H (ln1 ,ln\u221e ) } < 1,\nz\u2208\u22021\n\nz\u2208\u22020\n\nsatisfying\n(6.10)\n\n\u03c6ij (z) = \u03bbi (z)vij (z)\u03bcj (z).\n\nWe may replace (\u03bbi ) and (\u03bcj ) by (|\u03bbi | + \u03b5) and (|\u03bcj | + \u03b5) where \u03b5 > 0 is chosen small enough so\nthat (6.8) still holds. If we modify vij (z) so that (6.10) still holds (i.e. replace vij (z) by \u03bbi (|\u03bbi | +\n\u03b5)\u22121 vij \u03bcj (|\u03bcj | + \u03b5)\u22121 ), then (6.9) is preserved.\nBut now there are bounded outer functions (Fi ) and (Gj ) on S such that |Fi | = \u03bbi and |Gj | = \u03bcj\non \u2202S. Therefore if we define\nVij (z) = Fi (z)\u22121 \u03c6ij (z)Gj (z)\u22121\n\n32\n\n\fthen z \u2192 V (z) is analytic on S and satisfies\nmax{ess sup kV (z)kB(ln1 ,ln\u221e ) , ess sup kV (z)k\u0393H (ln1 ,ln\u221e ) } < 1.\nz\u2208\u22021\n\nz\u2208\u22020\n\nTherefore, on the one hand\n(6.11)\n\nkV (0)k(B(ln1 ,ln\u221e ),\u0393H (ln1 ,ln\u221e ))\u03b8 < 1,\n\non the other hand by the maximum principle\no\nnX\nX\nmax\n|Fi (0)|2 ,\n|Gj (0)|2 < 1,\n\nand finally \u03c6ij = \u03c6ij (0) = Fi (0)Vij (0)Gj (0). Since \u03c6 is invertible V (0) is also invertible. By (6.11)\nand Theorem 6.2, there is a space X in H(\u03b8, n) and elements xi \u2208 X \u2217 , yj \u2208 X with kxi k < 1,\nkyj k < 1 such that\nVij (0) = hxi , yj i.\nLet x\u2032i = Fi (0)xi and yj\u2032 = Gj (0)yj . Then we find\nE\nX\nX D X\n\u03c6(T ) =\n\u03c6ij Tij =\nx\u2032i ,\nTij yj\u2032\ni\n\nj\n\nand hence as announced\n\n|\u03c6(T )| \u2264 kTX k\n\n\u0010X\n\nkx\u2032i k2\n\nX\n\nkyj\u2032 k2\n\n\u00111/2\n\n\u2264 kTX k.\n\nRemark 6.5. Consider \u03c6 in B(ln2 ). It follows from the preceding proof that\n\u001a\u0010X\n\u00111/2\n\u00111/2 \u001b\n\u0010X\n2\n2\n|\u03bbi |\nkvk(B(ln1 ,ln\u221e ),\u0393H (ln1 ,ln\u221e ))\u03b8\n|\u03bcj |\nk\u03c6kB(\u03b8,n)\u2217 = inf\n\nwhere the infimum runs over all factorizations of \u03c6 of the form \u03c6 = \u03bbi vij \u03bcj . Indeed, \u2264 follows\nimmediately from Proposition 1.3 by interpolation and the converse is proved above (since we may\nreduce by density to the case when \u03c6 is invertible).\nCorollary 6.6. Let (\u03a9, A, \u03bc), (\u03a9\u2032 , A\u2032 , \u03bc\u2032 ) be a pair of measure spaces. Let Br = Br (L2 (\u03bc), L2 (\u03bc\u2032 ))\nand B = B(L2 (\u03bc), L2 (\u03bc\u2032 )). Fix 0 < \u03b8 < 1. Then the space (Br , B)\u03b8 consists of those T in B such\nthat TX is bounded for any arcwise \u03b8-Hilbertian Banach space X. Moreover,\n(6.12)\n\nkT k(Br ,B)\u03b8 =\n\nsup\nn,X\u2208H(\u03b8,n)\n\nkTX k = sup kTX k\n\nwhere the last supremum runs over all arcwise \u03b8-Hilbertian Banach spaces X.\nProof. By routine arguments, we can reduce this to the case when \u03bc, \u03bc\u2032 are probabilities. Then it\nis easy to see (e.g. using [42, p. 229]) that\n\u2032\n\nkT k(Br ,B)\u03b8 = sup kEB T EB k(Br ,B)\u03b8\nwhere the supremum runs over all finite \u03c3-subalgebras B \u2282 A, B \u2032 \u2282 A\u2032 . Similarly kTX k =\n\u2032\nsup k(EB T EB )X k. This reduces (6.12) to the case of finite measure spaces which can be deduced\nB,B\u2032\n\nfrom Theorem 6.4 by elementary arguments (approximate the weights by rational numbers, then\nconsider the span of suitable blocks on the canonical basis of ln2 ).\n33\n\n\fCorollary 6.7. Assume that a Banach space X satisfies \u2206X (\u03b5) \u2208 O(\u03b5\u03b1 ) for some \u03b1 > 0. Then,\nfor any \u03b8 < \u03b1, X is isomorphic to a subquotient of an arcwise \u03b8-Hilbertian space.\nProof. By Theorem 6.4 and Theorem 4.5 (with p = 2), it suffices to show that there is a constant\nC such that, for any n and any T \u2208 B(ln2 ), we have\n(6.13)\n\nkTX k \u2264 CkT kB(\u03b8,n) .\n\nOur assumption implies by homogeneity that for any such T\nkTX k \u2264 CkT k\u03b1 kT k1\u2212\u03b1\nreg .\nBy a classical real interpolation result (see [2, p. 58]), this can be rewritten as\nkTX k \u2264 C \u2032 kT k(Br (ln2 ),B(ln2 ))\u03b1,1 .\nTherefore, the conclusion follows from the general fact (see [2, p. 102]) that whenever we have an\n\u2032\u2032\ninclusion B0 \u2282 B1 , there is a constant C (depending only on \u03b1 and \u03b8) such that for any \u03b8 < \u03b1\nand any T in B0\n\u2032\u2032\nkT k(B0 ,B1 )\u03b1,1 \u2264 C kT k(B0 ,B1 )\u03b8 .\nThis yields the announced (6.13).\nRecalling Theorem 4.6, the next statement is now a consequence of Theorem 6.4.\nTheorem 6.8. Let C \u2265 1 be a constant. The following are equivalent:\n(i) X is C-isomorphic to a quotient of a subspace of an arcwise \u03b8-Hilbertian space.\n(ii) kTX k \u2264 C for any n and any T such that kT k(Br (ln2 ),B(ln2 ))\u03b8 \u2264 1.\nProof. Just observe that the class of arcwise \u03b8-Euclidean (or that of \u03b8-Hilbertian) spaces is stable\nby l2 -sums and apply Theorem 4.6 to the class B formed of all the \u03b8-Euclidean spaces.\n\n7\n\nArcwise versus not arcwise\n\nAt the time of this writing, we do not see (although we suspect there is) a direct way to reduce\nthe arcwise notions of \u03b8-Euclidean or \u03b8-Hilbertian to the non-arcwise ones. However, it follows\na posteriori from our main result that any \u03b8-Hilbertian space is a subquotient (or equivalently a\nquotient of a subspace) of an arcwise one.\nIndeed, consider a \u03b8-Euclidean family {X(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D}, i.e. one such that\nm({z \u2208 \u2202D | X(z) Hilbertian}) \u2265 \u03b8.\nLet \u03b1(z) be the indicator function of the set \u03931 = {z \u2208 \u2202D | X(z) is Hilbertian}, and let \u03930 =\n\u2202D\\\u03931 . We now let\nB0 = Br (ln2 )\nB1 = B(ln2 ),\nand consider the family\n\u03b2(z) = B\u03b1(z)\n\nz \u2208 \u2202D.\n\nNote that B\u03b1(z) = B1 on \u03931 and B\u03b1(z) = B0 on \u03930 . By [15, Cor. 5.1], we have isometrically\n(7.1)\n\n\u03b2(0) = (B0 , B1 )\u03b1(0)\n34\n\n\fwhere \u03b1(0) =\n(7.1), we have\n\nR\n\n\u03b1(z) dm(z) = m(\u03931 ) \u2265 \u03b8. Consider now T in the open unit ball of B(\u03b8, n). By\nkT k\u03b2(0) < 1.\n\n\u221e relative to the family {\u03b2(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D}\nTherefore, there is an analytic function T (*) in the space H#\nsatisfying ess sup\u2202D kT (z)k\u03b2(z) < 1 and T (0) = T . Let Y (z) = ln2 (X(z)). Clearly (see [14, 31]) we\nhave Y (0) = ln2 (X(0)) isometrically. Recall \u2202D = \u03930 \u222a \u03931 . Note that for any z \u2208 \u0393j (j = 0, 1) we\nhave \u03b2(z) = Bj and hence kT (z)kBj \u2264 1. Therefore\n\ness sup kT (z) \u2297 idX(z) : ln2 (X(z)) \u2192 ln2 (X(z))k \u2264 1.\nz\u2208\u2202D\n\nBy the interpolation principle 5.3, we must have\nkT (0) \u2297 idX(0) : ln2 (X(0)) \u2192 ln2 (X(0))k \u2264 1,\nso that since T = T (0) and X = X(0) we obtain kTX k \u2264 1. By homogeneity, this shows\n(7.2)\n\n\u2200T \u2208 B(\u03b8, n)\n\nkTX k \u2264 kT kB(\u03b8,n)\n\nfor all \u03b8-Euclidean spaces X (and not only the arcwise ones as in Theorem 6.4). But, since the class\nof X satisfying (7.2) is trivially stable under ultraproducts, subspaces and quotients, we find that\n(7.2) holds for all quotient of subspaces of \u03b8-Hilbertian spaces. By Theorem 6.8, this establishes\nthe following:\nTheorem 7.1. Any \u03b8-Hilbertian space is a quotient of a subspace (or equivalently is a subquotient)\nof an arcwise \u03b8-Hilbertian space.\nRemark 7.2. In particular, since a quotient of a subspace of a quotient of a subspace is again a\nquotient of a subspace, this shows that the properties in Theorem 6.8 are equivalent to\n(i)' X is C-isomorphic to a quotient of a subspace (or equivalently to a subquotient) of a \u03b8Hilbertian space.\nMoreover, this shows that Corollary 6.6 also holds with \"\u03b8-Hilbertian\" instead of \"arcwise \u03b8Hilbertian\" everywhere.\n\n8\n\nFourier and Schur multipliers\n\nLet G be a locally compact Abelian group. Let M (G) be the classical Banach space of complex\n(Radon) measures on G equipped with the total variation norm: k\u03bckM (G) = |\u03bc|(G). We view as\nusual L1 (G) as (isometric to) a subspace of M (G). Recall that the Fourier transform F takes M (G)\nb and L1 (G) to the subspace of Cb (G)\nb of functions tending to zero at \u221e. It is traditional to\nto Cb (G)\nb of inverse\nintroduce the space P M (G) of pseudo-measures on G formally as the set F \u22121 (L\u221e (G))\nFourier transforms, so that \u03bc \u2208 P M (G) iff\nb and\n\u03bc\u0302 \u2208 L\u221e (G)\n\ndef\n\nk\u03bckP M (G) = k\u03bc\u0302k\u221e .\n\nb (\"Fourier multiplier\"), so that the\nThen the multiplication by \u03bc\u0302 is a bounded operator on L2 (G)\nconvolution operator [\u03bc] : f \u2192 f \u2217 \u03bc is bounded on L2 (G) and\n\n(8.1)\n\nk[\u03bc] : L2 (G) \u2192 L2 (G)k = k\u03bckP M (G) .\n35\n\n\fSimilarly, it is not hard to see that [\u03bc] is regular iff \u03bc \u2208 M (G) and we have\n(8.2)\n\nk[\u03bc] : L2 (G) \u2192 L2 (G)kreg = k\u03bckM (G) .\n\nNote that with this notation we have a canonical inclusion\nM (G) \u2282 P M (G).\nTheorem 8.1. Let 0 < \u03b8 < 1. The space (M (G), P M (G))\u03b8 consists of the pseudo-measures \u03bc such\nthat [\u03bc]X is bounded on L2 (G; X) for any \u03b8-Hilbertian Banach space X and we have\nk\u03bck(M (G),P M (G))\u03b8 = sup k[\u03bc]X : L2 (X) \u2192 L2 (X)k\nX\n\nwhere the supremum runs over all such X's. The space (L1 (G), P M (G))\u03b8 coincides isometrically\nwith the closure of L1 (G) \u2282 M (G) in this space.\nProof. By the amenability of G it is well known that we have a norm 1 projection\nP : B(L2 (G)) \u2192 B(L2 (G))\nfrom L2 (G) onto the subspace {[\u03bc] | \u03bc \u2208 P M (G)}. This is analogous to the projection of B(l2 )\nonto the space of diagonal matrices. Identifying \u03bc with [\u03bc] by (8.1), this gives us a contractive\nprojection\nP : B(L2 (G)) \u2192 P M (G) \u2282 B(L2 (G)).\n\nNote that by (8.2) we have an isometric embedding M (G) \u2282 Br (L2 (G)). It is easy to show\n(left to the reader) that P (Br (L2 (G))) = M (G). By a well known argument, it follows that\n(M (G), P M (G))\u03b8 can be isometrically identified with the subspace of (Br , B)\u03b8 that is the range of\n\u03bc \u2192 [\u03bc]. From this the first assertion follows by Corollary 6.6 and Remark 7.2.\nAs for the second one, by [1], the closure of M (G) in (M (G), P M (G))\u03b8 can be identified with\n(M (G), P M (G))\u03b8 . Then using the fact that there is a net of maps \u03c6\u03b1 : M (G) \u2192 L1 (G) that are\nsimultaneous contractions on M (G) and on P M (G) (think of convolution by the Fejer kernel on\nT as the model) and such that k\u03c6\u03b1 (\u03bc) \u2212 \u03bck1 \u2192 0 for any \u03bc in L1 (G), it is easy to deduce that\n(L1 (G), P M (G))\u03b8 is the closure of L1 (G) in (M (G), P M (G))\u03b8 .\nRemark 8.2. It is easy to see that the preceding statement remains valid when G is a compact\n(non-Abelian) group or an amenable group. When G is locally compact amenable, we replace\nP M (G) by the von Neumann algebra of G, i.e. the von Neumann algebra generated by the left\nconvolutions by elements of L1 (G), or equivalently of M (G). Thus we again have an inclusion\n\u03bc 7\u2192 [\u03bc] from M (G) to P M (G), that we use for \"compatibility\" of the interpolation pair and the\npreceding statement continues to hold.\nWe can reformulate Theorem 6.2 as one about \"Schur multipliers.\" Let M denote the Banach\nspace of all bounded Schur multipliers on B(l2 ), i.e. M consists of bi-infinite matrices [\u03c6ij ] such\nthat the map\nM\u03c6 : [aij ] \u2192 [\u03c6ij aij ]\n\nis bounded on B(l2 ), with norm k\u03c6kM = kM\u03c6 : B(l2 ) \u2192 B(l2 )k. Let\n\nM[n] = {\u03c6 \u2208 M | \u03c6ij = 0 \u2200i > n \u2200j > n}.\nWe obviously have natural inclusions\nM \u2282 l\u221e (N \u00d7 N)\n2\n\nM[n] \u2282 ln\u221e .\n36\n\n\fCorollary 8.3. Let 0 < \u03b8 < 1. Fix n \u2265 1. We have isometrically\n2\n\n(ln\u221e , M[n])\u03b8 \u2243 \u0393\u03b8H (ln1 , ln\u221e ).\n2\n\nConsider an n \u00d7 n complex matrix \u03c6 = [\u03c6ij ]. Then \u03c6 belongs to the closed unit-ball of (ln\u221e , M[n])\u03b8\niff there are a \u03b8-Hilbertian space X, kj in the closed unit ball of X and hi in that of X \u2217 , such that\n(8.3)\n\n\u2200i, j\n\n\u03c6ij = hkj , hi i.\n\nMore generally, for any \u03c6 = [\u03c6ij ] \u2208 l\u221e (N \u00d7 N)\n(8.4)\n\nk\u03c6k(l\u221e (N\u00d7N),M)\u03b8 = inf{sup kkj kX sup khi kX \u2217 }\nj\n\ni\n\nwhere the infimum runs over all \u03b8-Hilbertian spaces X and all bounded sequences (kj ) in X and\n(hi ) in X \u2217 such that (8.3) holds.\nProof. By a classical result, we know that M[n] \u2243 \u0393H (ln1 , ln\u221e ) isometrically (see e.g. [65, Th. 5.1]);\n2\nmoreover it is obvious that ln\u221e \u2243 B(ln1 , ln\u221e ) isometrically, and \"compatibly\" with the preceding\n2\nisomorphism. Therefore we may isometrically identify (ln\u221e , M[n])\u03b8 with (B(ln1 , ln\u221e ), \u0393H (ln1 , ln\u221e ))\u03b8 ,\nwhich, by Theorem 6.2 coincides with \u0393\u03b8H (ln1 , ln\u221e ). But now a mapping \u03c6 : ln1 \u2192 ln\u221e is in the\nunit ball of \u0393\u03b8H (ln1 , ln\u221e ) iff it satisfies the condition in Corollary 8.3. This proves the first (finite\ndimensional) assertion. We leave the extension to the infinite dimensional case to the reader.\nCorollary 8.4. The norm (8.4) coincides with the norm of (\u03c6ij ) acting as a Schur multiplier on\n(Br (l2 ), B(l2 ))\u03b8 or on (Br (l2 ), B(l2 ))\u03b8 . Moreover, it is also equal to its norm as a multiplier from\n(Br (l2 ), B(l2 ))\u03b8 to B(l2 ).\nProof. Assume that (\u03c6ij ) is supported on [1, . . . , n] \u00d7 [1, . . . , n]. Note that k\u03c6kM = kM\u03c6 : B(ln2 ) \u2192\nB(ln2 )k and k\u03c6kl\u221e (N\u00d7N) = kM\u03c6 : Br (ln2 ) \u2192 Br (ln2 )k. Hence, if (8.4) is \u2264 1, by interpolation we\nmust have kM\u03c6 : B(\u03b8, n) \u2192 B(\u03b8, n)k \u2264 1. A fortiori, we have kM\u03c6 : B(\u03b8, n) \u2192 B(ln2 )k \u2264 1 or\nequivalently for any \u03bb, \u03bc in ln2 and a in B(ln2 )\nX\n\n\u03c6ij aij \u03bbi \u03bcj \u2264 kakB(\u03b8,n) k\u03bbkln2 k\u03bckln2 .\n\nBy Proposition 6.3, the latter implies that\nX\n\u03c6ij vij \u2264 kvk(N (ln\u221e ,ln1 ),\u0393\u2217H (ln\u221e ,ln1 ))\u03b8\nand hence\n\nk\u03c6k(B(ln1 ,ln\u221e ),\u0393H (ln1 ,ln\u221e ))\u03b8 \u2264 1.\nBy Theorem 6.2, this implies that (8.4) is \u2264 1. The preceding chain of implications completes\nthe proof when (\u03c6ij ) is finitely supported. The general case is easy to deduce by an ultraproduct\nargument and pointwise compactness of the unit balls of the spaces of Schur multipliers under\nconsideration. We skip the details.\nRemark 8.5. In answer to a question of Peller, it was proved in [26] (see also [79]) that, for any\n1 < p < \u221e, the interpolation space considered in (8.4) does not contain the space of Schur\nmultipliers that are bounded on Sp . The corresponding fact for Fourier multipliers on Lp (G) (with\nrespect to Theorem 8.1) has been in the harmonic analysis folklore for a long time.\n37\n\n\f9\n\nA characterization of uniformly curved spaces\n\nWe will now try to obtain some sort of \"geometric\" (or \"structural\") equivalent description of\nuniformly curved Banach spaces, i.e. those X's such that \u2206X (\u03b5) \u2192 0 when \u03b5 \u2192 0.\nThe main point is the following. This is sort of a real interpolation variant of (6.1).\nLemma 9.1. Let X be a finite dimensional Banach space. Assume that for some n \u2265 1, we\nhave linear maps J : X \u2192 ln\u221e and Q : ln1 \u2192 X both with norm \u2264 1. Then, for any \u03b5 > 0, the\ncomposition JQ : ln1 \u2192 ln\u221e admits a decomposition JQ = u0 + u1 with uj : ln1 \u2192 ln\u221e such that:\n\u03b3H (u1 ) \u2264 2\u03b5\u22121 \u2206X (\u03b5)\n\nand\n\nku0 k \u2264 2\u2206X (\u03b5).\n\nThe proof combines duality with a change of density argument. By duality, our assertion is\nequivalent to the following: for any v : ln\u221e \u2192 ln1 we have\n(9.1)\n\n\u2217\n|tr(vJQ)| \u2264 2\u03b5\u22121 \u2206X (\u03b5)\u03b3H\n(v) + 2\u2206X (\u03b5)N (v),\n\nwhere N (v) denotes the nuclear norm of v. To prove this we need to recall Proposition 1.2.\n\u2217 (v) +\nProof of Lemma 9.1. It suffices to establish (9.1) for any v : ln\u221e \u2192 ln1 . Assume that \u03b5\u22121 \u03b3H\n\u2217 (v) \u2264 \u03b5. By Proposition 1.2, we can write v\n\u2032\n\u2032\nN (v) \u2264 1. Then N (v) \u2264 1 and \u03b3H\nij = \u03bbi bij \u03bcj\n\u2032\n\u2032\nn\nand vij = \u03bbi aij \u03bcj with \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bb , \u03bc in the unit ball of l2 and with kbkreg \u2264 1, kakB(ln2 ) \u2264 \u03b5. Let\n\u03bei = |\u03bb\u2032i | \u2228 |\u03bbi | and \u03b7j = |\u03bcj | \u2228 |\u03bc\u2032j |. Then 2\u22121/2 \u03be and 2\u22121/2 \u03b7 are in the unit ball of ln2 and we can\nwrite vij = \u03bei tij \u03b7j with\nktk \u2264 \u03b5 and ktkreg \u2264 1.\n\n(Indeed, tij = \u03bbi \u03bei\u22121 (aij )\u03bcj \u03b7j\u22121 with |\u03bbi \u03bei\u22121 | \u2264 1 and |\u03bcj \u03b7j\u22121 | \u2264 1, so that ktk \u2264 kak and similarly\nktkreg \u2264 kbkreg ). Therefore, we have ktX kB(ln2 (X)) \u2264 \u2206X (\u03b5). But now, if we denote\nJ \u2217 ei = x\u2217i \u2208 X \u2217\n\nQei = xi \u2208 X,\nwe find\ntr(vJQ) =\n\nX\nij\n\nvij hx\u2217i , xj i =\n\nX\nij\n\ntij h\u03bei x\u2217i , \u03b7j xj i\n\nand hence\n|tr(vJQ)| \u2264 ktX k\n\n\u0010X\n\nk\u03bei x\u2217i k2\n\n\u2264 2ktX k \u2264 2\u2206X (\u03b5).\n\n\u00111/2 \u0010X\n\nk\u03b7j xj k2\n\n\u00111/2\n\nThus, by homogeneity we obtain (9.1).\nTheorem 9.2. Let X be a Banach space. The following properties are equivalent.\n(i) X is uniformly curved.\n(ii) For some index set I, there are a metric surjection Q : l1 (I) \u2192 X and an isometric embedding\nJ : X \u2192 l\u221e (I) such that JQ belongs to the closure of \u0393H (l1 (I), l\u221e (I)) in B(l1 (I), l\u221e (I)).\n(iii) For any \u03b4 > 0 there is a constant C(\u03b4) satisfying the following: for any measure spaces (\u03a9, \u03bc),\n(\u03a9\u2032 , \u03bc\u2032 ), for any maps v : X \u2192 L\u221e (\u03bc) and v \u2032 : L1 (\u03bc\u2032 ) \u2192 X and for any \u03b4 > 0 there is u in\n\u0393H (L1 (\u03bc\u2032 ), L\u221e (\u03bc)) with \u03b3H (u) \u2264 C(\u03b4)kvkkv \u2032 k and ku \u2212 vv \u2032 k < \u03b4kvkkv \u2032 k.\n38\n\n\f(iv) For each \u03b4 > 0, there is C(\u03b4) satisfying: there are a Hilbert space H and functions \u03c6 : X \u2192 H,\n\u03c8 : X \u2217 \u2192 H such that for all (\u03be, x) in X \u2217 \u00d7 X we have\n|\u03be(x) \u2212 h\u03c8(\u03be), \u03c6(x)i| \u2264 \u03b4k\u03bekkxk\nk\u03c6(x)k \u2264 C(\u03b4)1/2 kxk\n\nk\u03c8(\u03be)k \u2264 C(\u03b4)1/2 k\u03bek.\nProof. We first show (i) \u21d2 (ii). Assume (i). Let (X\u03b1 ) be a directed family of finite dimensional\nsubspaces of X with \u222aX\u03b1 = X. Let \u03b5\u03b1 > 0 be chosen so that \u03b5\u03b1 \u2192 0 when \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e in the directed\nfamily. For each \u03b1, we can choose a finite \u03b5\u03b1 -net (xi )i\u2208I\u03b1 in the unit ball of X\u03b1 . Let I be the\ndisjoint union of the sets I\u03b1 and let Q : l1 (I) \u2192 X be the map defined by Qei = xi . Clearly Q is\na metric surjection onto X.\nEnlarging the sets I\u03b1 if necessary we may also find a family (x\u2217i )i\u2208I\u03b1 in the unit ball of X \u2217 such\nthat x\u2217i|X\u03b1 is an \u03b5\u03b1 -net in the unit ball of X\u03b1\u2217 .\n\u2217 : X \u2192 l (I). Note that J\nWe then define R : l1 (I) \u2192 X \u2217 again by Rei = x\u2217i and let J = R|X\n\u221e\nis an isometry.\nGiven any bilinear form \u03c6 on l1 (I) \u00d7 l1 (I), we will denote by \u03b3H (\u03c6) the \u03b3H -norm of the\nassociated linear map from l1 (I) to l\u221e (I). Let \u03c6 : l1 (I)\u00d7l1 (I) \u2192 C be the bilinear form associated\nto JQ : l1 (I) \u2192 l\u221e (I).\nLet G\u03b1 = \u222a{I\u03b2 | \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b1} so that G\u03b1 is an increasing family of finite subsets of I with union I.\nObserve that, if we view l1 (G\u03b1 ) and l\u221e (G\u03b1 ) as subspaces of respectively l1 (I) and l\u221e (I), we have\nQl1 (G\u03b1 ) \u2282 X\u03b1 and J(X\u03b1 ) \u2282 l\u221e (G\u03b1 ).\nLet \u03c6\u03b1 : l1 (G\u03b1 ) \u00d7 l1 (G\u03b1 ) \u2192 C be the restriction of \u03c6. By the preceding observation, the\nassociated linear map factors through X\u03b1 . Choose \u03b5 so that 2\u2206X (\u03b5) < \u03b4. By Lemma 9.1, we have\na decomposition\n\u03c6\u03b1 = \u03c60\u03b1 + \u03c61\u03b1\nwith k\u03c60\u03b1 k \u2264 \u03b4 and \u03b3H (\u03c61\u03b1 ) \u2264 C where C = 2\u03b5\u22121 \u2206X (\u03b5). Let \u03c8\u03b1 : l1 (I) \u00d7 l1 (I) \u2192 C be defined\nby \u03c8\u03b1 (x, y) = \u03c6\u03b1 (x|G\u03b1 , y|G\u03b1 ). Clearly \u03c8\u03b1 admits a similar decomposition \u03c8\u03b1 = \u03c8\u03b10 + \u03c8\u03b11 , with the\nsame bounds. Moreover for any x, y in l1 (I)\n\u03c8\u03b1 (x, y) \u2192 \u03c6(x, y).\nLet U be an ultrafilter refining the directed net of the \u03b1's and let\n\u03c60 (x, y) = lim \u03c8\u03b10 (x, y)\nU\n\n\u03c61 (x, y) = lim \u03c8\u03b11 (x, y)\nU\n\nThen \u03c6 = \u03c60 + \u03c61 , k\u03c60 k \u2264 \u03b4 and \u03b3H (\u03c61 ) \u2264 C, so that (ii) holds.\nThis shows (i) \u21d2 (ii). Assume (ii). Clearly, this implies the following assertion. \u2200\u03b4 > 0 \u2203u\u03b4 \u2208\n\u0393H (l1 (I), l\u221e (I)) such that ku\u03b4 \u2212 JQk < \u03b4. Let C(\u03b4) = \u03b3H (u\u03b4 ). Assume first that L1 (\u03bc) = l1 (I1 )\nand L\u221e (\u03bc\u2032 ) = l\u221e (I2 ), relative to sets I1 , I2 . By the lifting (resp. extension) property of l1 (I1 )\n(resp. l\u221e (I2 )) it is easy to deduce (iii) in that case from the preceding assertion. But now since\nL1 -spaces are stable under ultraproducts, one can easily obtain (iii) with the same bound C(\u03b4) for\narbitrary measure spaces.\n\n39\n\n\fWe have trivially (iii) \u21d2 (ii). We will now show (ii) \u21d2 (i). Assume (ii). Let u\u03b4 and C(\u03b4) be as\nabove. Consider T : ln2 \u2192 ln2 with kT kreg \u2264 1 and kT k \u2264 \u03b5. We have\nkT \u2297 JQk \u2264 kT \u2297 u\u03b4 k + kT \u2297 (JQ \u2212 u\u03b4 )k\n\u2264 kT k\u03b3H (u\u03b4 ) + kT kreg \u03b4\n\u2264 \u03b5C(\u03b4) + \u03b4\n\nand hence passing to subspaces and quotients\nkTX k \u2264 \u03b5C(\u03b4) + \u03b4.\nThus we see that\n\u2206X (\u03b4C(\u03b4)\u22121 ) \u2264 2\u03b4\nwhich shows that the (nondecreasing) function \u2206X (\u03b5) takes arbitrarily small values, i.e. (i) holds.\nThis shows the equivalence of the first three properties. We now turn to the equivalence with (iv).\nLet I = BX \u2217 \u00d7 BX and let Jy(\u03be, x) = \u03be(y) and Q\u2217 \u03b7(\u03be, x) = \u03b7(x) for all (\u03be, x) in I, y \u2208 X, \u03b7 \u2208 X \u2217 .\nThen it is easy to see that (iv) implies (ii). Conversely assume (iii). Let (\u03a9, \u03bc) (resp. (\u03a9\u2032 , \u03bc\u2032 )) be\nthe unit sphere of X (resp. X \u2217 ) equipped with the discrete counting measure. Let J : l1 (\u03a9) \u2192 X\nand Q : X \u2192 l\u221e (\u03a9\u2032 ) be defined by Je\u03c9 = \u03c9 and Q\u2217 e\u03c9\u2032 = \u03c9 \u2032 . Then Q is isometric and J is a metric\nsurjection. Assuming (iii), we can write kQJ \u2212 vv \u2032 k < \u03b4 for some v \u2032 : l1 (\u03a9) \u2192 H, v : H \u2192 l\u221e (\u03a9\u2032 )\nwith kv \u2032 k \u2264 C(\u03b4)1/2 , kvk \u2264 C(\u03b4)1/2 . We then find \u2200(\u03be, x) \u2208 \u03a9\u2032 \u00d7 \u03a9\nh\u03c9 \u2032 , \u03c9i = hQJ(e\u03c9 ), e\u03c9\u2032 i = hv \u2032 (e\u03c9 ), v \u2217 (e\u03c9\u2032 )i\nand hence if we set \u03c6(\u03c9) = v \u2032 (e\u03c9 ) and \u03c8(\u03c9 \u2032 ) = v \u2217 (e\u03c9\u2032 ) we obtain the desired functions but restricted\nto the unit spheres. Extending \u03c6 (resp. \u03c8) by homogeneity to functions on the whole of X (resp.\nX \u2217 ) yields (iv).\n\n10\n\nExtension property of regular operators\n\nLet (\u03a9, \u03bc), (\u03a9, \u03bc\u2032 ) be measure spaces. Let 1 < p < \u221e. In this section, we will consider a subspace\nSp \u2282 Lp (\u03bc) and a quotient Qp = Lp (\u03bc\u2032 )/Rp where Rp \u2282 Lp (\u03bc\u2032 ) is another closed subspace. We\ndenote by q : Lp (\u03bc\u2032 ) \u2192 Qp the quotient map. We seek to characterize the mappings u : Sp \u2192 Qp\nthat admit a regular \"extension\" to a mapping \u00fb : Lp (\u03bc) \u2192 Lp (\u03bc\u2032 ). We will use the following\nsuggestive notation (motivated by Hp -space theory): for any Banach space X we denote by Sp (X)\nthe closure in Lp (X) of the (algebraic) tensor product Sp \u2297 X, and similarly for Rp (X). We will\ndenote by Qp (X) the quotient space Lp (\u03bc\u2032 ; X)/Rp (X). Note that we have natural linear inclusions\n(with dense range) Sp \u2297 X \u2282 Sp (X) and Qp \u2297 X \u2282 Qp (X). Consider u : Sp \u2192 Qp and let\nu \u2297 IX : Sp \u2297 X \u2192 Qp \u2297 X be the associated linear map. When this map is bounded for the\ninduced norms, it uniquely extends to a bounded mapping, denoted by uX : Sp (X) \u2192 Qp (X). In\nthat case, we will simply say that uX is bounded.\nLet Tp\u2032 \u2282 Lp\u2032 (\u03bc\u2032 ) denote the orthogonal of Rp , so that, equivalently Rp = Tp\u22a5\u2032 . We may view u\nas a bilinear form \u03c6 on Sp \u00d7 Tp\u2032 . The tensor product of u and the duality map X \u00d7 X \u2217 \u2192 C defines\na bilinear form\n\u03c6X : (Sp \u2297 X) \u00d7 (Tp\u2032 \u2297 X \u2217 ) \u2192 C.\nAssume for simplicity that X is finite dimensional (or merely reflexive). In that case\nQp (X) = Tp\u2032 (X \u2217 )\u2217 ,\n40\n\n\fso that \u03c6X extends to a bounded bilinear form on Sp (X) \u00d7 Tp\u2032 (X \u2217 ) iff uX : Sp (X) \u2192 Qp (X) is\nbounded.\nThe following extends a result from [61].\nTheorem 10.1. Let u : Sp \u2192 Qp be as above. Fix C \u2265 1. The following are equivalent.\n(i) There is a regular operator \u0169 : Lp (\u03bc) \u2192 Lp (\u03bc\u2032 ) with k\u0169kreg \u2264 C such that u = q \u0169|Sp .\n(ii) For any Banach space X, uX is bounded and kuX : Sp (X) \u2192 Qp (X)k \u2264 C.\n(iii) Same as (ii) for any finite dimensional Banach space.\nProof. (i) \u21d2 (ii) \u21d2 (iii) are obvious so it suffices to show (iii) \u21d2 (i). Assume (iii). Let \u03c6 : Sp \u00d7 Tp\u2032\nbe the bilinear form associated to u. It suffices to show that for any v \u2208 Sp \u2297 Tp\u2032 such that v lies\nb r Lp\u2032 (see 1.7 above) we have\nin the unit ball of Lp \u2297\n(10.1)\n\n|h\u03c6, vi| \u2264 C.\n\nIndeed, if this holds, \u03c6 will admit a Hahn\u2013Banach extension \u03c6\ne with k\u03c6k\ne (Lp \u2297\nb r Lp\u2032 )\u2217 \u2264 C and the\nlinear map \u0169 associated to \u03c6\ne will satisfy (i).\nThus it suffices to show (10.1). Let v \u2208 Sp \u2297 Tp\u2032 be such that kvkLp \u2297\nb r Lp\u2032 < 1. Note that\nv \u2208 E \u2297 F where E \u2282 Sp , F \u2282 Tp\u2032 are finite dimensional subspaces, therefore we may as well\nassume, without loss of generality, that Sp and Tp\u2032 themselves are finite dimensional.\nBy (1.5) there is a finite dimensional Banach space Y and there are \u03be \u2208 Lp (\u03bc; Y ), \u03b7 \u2208 Lp\u2032 (\u03bc\u2032 ; Y \u2217 )\nwith k\u03bek \u2264 1, k\u03b7k \u2264 1 such that\n(10.2)\n\nv(s, t) = h\u03be(s), \u03b7(t)i.\n\nWe claim that we can replace Y by a finite dimensional space Ye , and replace \u03be, \u03b7 by \u03be\u0303, \u03b7\u0303 so that \u03be\u0303\n(resp. \u03b7\u0303) is in the unit ball of Sp (Ye ) (resp. Tp\u2032 (Ye \u2217 )), but so that we still have\n\n(10.3)\n\nv(s, t) = h\u03be\u0303(s), \u03b7\u0303(t)i.\n\nLet S \u2282 Lp (\u03bc) be any subspace supplementary to Sp (recall that we assume Sp finite dimensional).\nClearly \u03be \u2208 Lp \u2297 Y can be written\n\u03be = \u03be1 + \u03be2\nwith \u03be1 \u2208 Sp \u2297Y and \u03be2 \u2208 S \u2297Y . But since v(s, t) = h\u03be(s), \u03b7(t)i \u2208 Sp \u2297Lp\u2032 and h\u03be2 (s), \u03b7(t)i \u2208 S \u2297Lp\u2032\nwe must have\n(10.4)\n\nh\u03be2 (s), \u03b7(t)i = 0.\n\nR\nLet Z \u2282 Y be the closed span in Y of all elements of the form x(s)\u03be2 (s)d\u03bc(s) with x a scalar\nvalued function in Lp\u2032 . Note that \u03be2 is Z-valued. By (10.4) hz, \u03b7(t)i = 0 for any z in Z, so that \u03b7\ndefines an element of Lp\u2032 (Z \u22a5 ) with k\u03b7k \u2264 1. Let q1 : Y \u2192 Y /Z be the quotient map. Let \u03be\u0302 = q1 (\u03be).\nThen \u03be\u02c6 is in the unit ball of Lp (Y /Z) and (10.2) is preserved: if we denote \u03b7\u0302 the same as \u03b7 but\nviewed as an element of the unit ball of Lp\u2032 (Z \u22a5 ), we have\n(10.5)\n\nv(s, t) = h\u03be\u0302(s), \u03b7\u0302(t)i.\n\nThe advantage of this is that now \u03be\u02c6 \u2208 Sp (Y /Z) (because, since \u03be2 takes its values in Z, \u03be\u02c6 = q1 (\u03be1 )).\nLet Yb = Y /Z. The only missing point is that \u03b7\u0302 should be also in Tp\u2032 (Yb \u2217 ) instead of only in Lp\u2032 (Yb \u2217 ).\n41\n\n\fTo achieve this we repeat the preceding operations on \u03b7\u0302: we consider a direct sum decomposition\nLp\u2032 = Tp\u2032 \u2295 T and a decomposition\n\u03b7\u0302 = \u03b71 + \u03b72\nwith \u03b71 \u2208 Tp\u2032 (Yb \u2217 ), \u03b72 \u2208 T \u2297 Yb \u2217 . We introduce the subspace W \u2282 Yb \u2217 spanned by all integrals of\nR\nthe form y(t)\u03b72 (t)d\u03bc\u2032 (t) with y \u2208 Lp (\u03bc\u2032 ). Let r : Yb \u2217 \u2192 Yb \u2217 /W be the quotient map, and let Ye\nbe such that Yb \u2217 /W = (Ye )\u2217 . Then, we set \u03b7\u0303 = r(\u03b7\u0302). Note that \u03b7\u0303 is in the unit ball of Tp\u2032 (Ye \u2217 ). By\n(10.5), since v \u2208 Sp \u2297 Tp\u2032 \u2282 Lp \u2297 Tp\u2032 we must have h\u03be\u0302, wi = 0 for any w in W , and hence we find\nthat \u03be\u0302(t) \u2208 W \u22a5 = Ye , so that \u03be\u02c6 can be identified with an element \u03be\u0303 in the unit ball of Sp (Ye ), and\nwe have (10.3). This proves the announced claim. From this claim, it is now easy to conclude: we\nhave\nh\u03c6, vi = \u03c6Ye (\u03be\u0303, \u03b7\u0303)\nand hence if (iii) holds\n|h\u03c6, vi| \u2264 k\u03c6Ye kk\u03be\u0303kSp (Ye ) k\u03b7\u0303kT\n\ne \u2217)\n\np\u2032 (Y\n\n\u2264 k\u03c6Ye k = kuYe k \u2264 C.\n\nThis establishes (10.1).\nConsider subspaces F \u2282 E \u2282 Lp (\u03bc) and F \u2032 \u2282 E \u2032 \u2282 Lp (\u03bc\u2032 ). Let E/F (resp. E \u2032 /F \u2032 ) be the\nassociated subquotient of Lp (\u03bc) (resp. Lp (\u03bc\u2032 )). Let v : Lp (\u03bc) \u2192 Lp (\u03bc\u2032 ) be an operator such that\nv(E) \u2282 E \u2032 and v(F ) \u2282 F \u2032 . Then v defines an operator u : E/F \u2192 E \u2032 /F \u2032 with kuk \u2264 kvk. We\ncall u the \"compression\" of v and say that v is a \"dilation\" of u. Given a Banach space X, we can\nequip (E/F ) \u2297 X with the norm of the space E(X)/F (X), we denote by (E/F )[X] the completion\nof (E/F ) \u2297 X for this norm; and similarly for E \u2032 /F \u2032 . Consider an operator u : E/F \u2192 E \u2032 /F \u2032 .\nAssume that u \u2297 IX : (E/F ) \u2297 X \u2192 (E \u2032 /F \u2032 ) \u2297 X is bounded for the norms of E(X)/F (X) and\nE \u2032 (X)/F \u2032 (X). In that case, we denote by uX : (E/F )[X] \u2192 (E \u2032 /F \u2032 )[X] the resulting operator and\nwe simply say that uX is bounded.\nCorollary 10.2. Let F \u2282 E \u2282 Lp (\u03bc) and F \u2032 \u2282 E \u2032 \u2282 Lp (\u03bc\u2032 ) be as above. Let C \u2265 1. The following\nproperties of a linear map u : E/F \u2192 E \u2032 /F \u2032 as equivalent:\n(i) There is a regular operator \u0169 : Lp (\u03bc) \u2192 Lp (\u03bc\u2032 ) dilating u (in particular such that \u0169(E) \u2282 E \u2032\nand \u0169(F ) \u2282 F \u2032 ) with k\u0169kreg \u2264 C.\n(ii) For any Banach space X, kuX k \u2264 C.\n(iii) For any finite dimensional Banach space X, kuX k \u2264 C.\nProof. Let q : E \u2192 E/F , q \u2032 : E \u2032 \u2192 E \u2032 /F \u2032 and Q\u2032 : Lp (\u03bc\u2032 ) \u2192 Lp (\u03bc\u2032 )/F \u2032 be the quotient maps. Let\nj : E \u2032 /F \u2032 \u2192 Lp (\u03bc\u2032 )/F \u2032 be the canonical inclusion. Assume (iii). Then, for any finite dimensional\nX, k(juq)X : E(X) \u2192 (Lp /F \u2032 )[X]k \u2264 C, and hence by the theorem, uq admits an \"extension\"\nw : Lp \u2192 Lp\u2032 with kwkreg \u2264 C such that Q\u2032 w|E = juq. Note that Q\u2032 w(F ) = 0 and hence\nw(F ) \u2282 F \u2032 . In addition, Q\u2032 w(E) = ju(E/F ) implies w(E) + F \u2032 = Q\u2032\u22121 (u(E/F )) \u2282 E \u2032 , and hence\n(since F \u2032 \u2282 E \u2032 ) w(E) \u2282 E \u2032 . It follows easily that w dilates u. This shows that (iii) implies (i). The\nrest is obvious.\nRemark 10.3. Assume p = 2. Consider a subspace G \u2282 L2 (\u03bc). Note that there are a priori many\ninequivalent ways by which we can \"realize\" G isometrically as a subquotient of L2 (\u03bc): whenever\nwe have F \u2282 E \u2282 L2 (\u03bc) with G = E \u2296 F then we may identify G with E/F and study the \"regular\n42\n\n\foperators u : E/F \u2192 Y where Y = E \u2032 /F \u2032 , i.e. the operators u such that uX is bounded for all X.\nIt is natural to set\nkukreg = sup{kuX k | dim(X) < \u221e},\n\nand then the preceding statement says that kukreg = inf k\u0169kreg where the infimum runs over all\ndilations \u0169 : L2 (\u03bc) \u2192 L2 (\u03bc\u2032 ) of u. But we should emphasize that all this depends a priori strongly\non the choice of the realization of G as E \u2296 F ! Thus it is natural to ask what are the linear maps\nu : G \u2192 G\u2032 (here G\u2032 is another subspace of L2 ) for which there is a choice of E, F and E \u2032 , F \u2032 with\nG = E \u2296 F and G\u2032 = E \u2032 \u2296 F \u2032 that turns u into a regular operator. The answer is simple: these are\nthe maps that are regular viewed as maps from the subspace G to the quotient L2 /G\u2032\u22a5 . Indeed, it\nis easy to see that these are the extremal choices.\nRemark 10.4. Let B be a class of Banach spaces stable by lp -direct sum. For any u : Sp \u2192 Qp as\nin Theorem 10.1 we set\nkukB = sup{kuX k | X \u2208 B}.\n\nLet SQ(B) denote the class of all subquotients of spaces in B. The proof of Theorem 10.1 shows\nthat the following are equivalent:\n(i) u admits an extension \u0169 with k\u0169kB \u2264 C,\n(ii) sup{kuX k | X \u2208 SQ(B)} \u2264 C,\n(iii) sup{kuX k | X \u2208 SQ(B), dim(X) < \u221e} \u2264 C.\n\nA similar generalization holds in the situation of Corollary 10.2.\n\n11\n\nGeneralizations\n\nIn this section, we wish to give a very general statement describing in particular the interpolation\nspace (B(lnp0 ), B(lnp1 ))\u03b8 for 0 < \u03b8 < 1, 1 \u2264 p0 , p1 \u2264 \u221e. In order to formulate our result in full\ngenerality, we will need to introduce more specific notation. For simplicity, we first restrict to the\nfinite dimensional case, so we fix an integer n \u2265 1.\nThe set of all n-dimensional Banach spaces Bn is equipped with the Banach\u2013Mazur distance\n\u03b4(E, F ) = logd(E, F ) where d is defined by\n\u2200E, F \u2208 Bn\n\nd(E, F ) = inf{kukku\u22121 k}\n\nwhere the infimum runs over all isomorphisms u : E \u2192 F . By convention, we identify two elements\nE and F of Bn if E, F are isometric. Then (Bn , \u03b4) is a compact metric space.\nFor any z in \u2202D, we give ourselves p(z) in [1, \u221e] and a subset B(z) \u2282 Bn . We will assume that\nz 7\u2192 p(z) is measurable and also that z 7\u2192 B(z) is measurable in a suitable sense, explained below.\nLet {Ym | m \u2265 1} be a dense sequence in the compact metric space Bn . Given Y in Bn and a\nclass B \u2282 Bn , let us denote\nd(Y, B) = inf{d(Y, X) | X \u2208 B}.\nWe will assume that\n\nz 7\u2192 B(z)\n\nis measurable in the following sense: for any Y in Bn , the function z 7\u2192 d(Y, B(z)) is (Borel)\nmeasurable on \u2202D. It is easy to check that for any (non-void) B \u2282 Bn and any map u : E \u2192 F\nbetween n-dimensional Banach spaces we have\n\u03b3B (u) = inf \u03b3{Ym } (u)d(Ym , B).\nm\u22651\n\n43\n\n\fThis shows that for any such u, the function z 7\u2192 \u03b3B(z) (u) is measurable on \u2202D.\nThis, together with 4.11, shows that {\u0393B(z) (E, F ) | z \u2208 \u2202D} forms a compatible family if E, F\nare finite dimensional.\nLet us say that B \u2282 Bn is an SQ(p)-class if B contains all the n-dimensional spaces that are\nsubquotients of ultraproducts of spaces of the form lp ({Xi | i \u2208 I}) with Xi \u2208 B for all i in I, I\nbeing an arbitrary finite set. We assume, of course, that any space isometrically isomorphic to one\nin B is in B as well. Moreover, we assume that B is non-void, which boils down to assuming that\nC belongs to B.\nWe assume that B(z) is an SQ(p(z))-class for all z in \u2202D.\nFor any \u03be in D, we can then define B(\u03be) as the class formed of all X in Bn that can be written\nas X = X(\u03be) for some compatible family {X(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} such that X(z) \u2208 B(z) for almost all z\nin \u2202D.\nWe denote by p(\u03be) the number defined by\nZ\n1\n1\n=\nd\u03bc\u03be (z)\np(\u03be)\np(z)\n\u2202D\n\nwhere \u03bc\u03be is given by (5.4). Recall that, if \u03be = 0, \u03bc0 is just normalized Lebesgue measure on \u2202D.\nBy conformal equivalence, we may always restrict ourselves, if we wish, to the case \u03be = 0.\nLet {X(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} be a compatible family of n-dimensional Banach spaces and let\n(11.1)\n\nL(z) = lnp(z) (X(z))\n\nfor all z \u2208 \u2202D. Then let L(\u03be) and X(\u03be) be the interpolated families defined for \u03be \u2208 D. By [14, 31],\nwe have isometrically\n(11.2)\n\nL(\u03be) = lnp(\u03be) (X(\u03be))\n\n\u2200\u03be \u2208 D.\n\nIn particular, when X(z) = C for all z, if we set l(z) = lnp(z) , then we find\n(11.3)\n\nl(\u03be) = lnp(\u03be)\n\n\u2200\u03be \u2208 D.\n\nGiven 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e and an SQ(p)-class B \u2282 Bn , we denote by \u03b2(p, B) the space B(lnp ) equipped\nwith the norm\n\u2200T \u2208 B(lnp )\n\nkT k\u03b2(p,B) = sup kTX : lnp (X) \u2192 lnp (X)k.\nX\u2208B\n\nNote that\nkT k\u03b2(p,B) = sup{kTYm k/d(Ym , B)}.\nm\n\nThis shows that z 7\u2192 kT k\u03b2(p(z),B(z)) is measurable on \u2202D and hence (since kT k \u2264 kTX k \u2264 kT kreg )\nfor all T : lnp \u2192 lnp ) that {\u03b2(p(z), B(z)) | z \u2208 \u2202D} is a compatible family.\nWe can now state our main result.\nTheorem 11.1. With the preceding notation, we set\n\u2200z \u2208 \u2202D\n\n\u03b2(z) = \u03b2(p(z), B(z)).\n\nThen, for all \u03be in D we have an isometric identity\n\u03b2(\u03be) = \u03b2(p(\u03be), B(\u03be)).\n44\n\n\fRemark. The easier \"half\" of this statement is the following claim: for all n \u00d7 n-matrices T\nkT k\u03b2(p(\u03be),B(\u03be)) \u2264 kT k\u03b2(\u03be) .\nThis follows essentially by the interpolation property. Indeed, assume kT k\u03b2(\u03be) < 1, so that we can\n\u221e relative to the family\nwrite T = T (\u03be) for some analytic function T (.) in the unit ball of the space H#\n{\u03b2(p(z), B(z)) | z \u2208 \u2202D}. Then (at least on a full measure subset of \u2202D) we have kT (z) : L(z) \u2192\nL(z)k \u2264 1 where X(z) \u2208 B(z) is essentially arbitrary and L(z) is as in (11.1) (note that for simplicity\nwe write here T (z) instead of T (z)X(z) ). By interpolation this implies kT (\u03be) : L(\u03be) \u2192 L(\u03be)k \u2264 1,\nand hence, using (11.2), since T = T (\u03be), we find kT : lnp(\u03be) (X(\u03be)) \u2192 lnp(\u03be) (X(\u03be))k \u2264 1, and since the\ncompatible family X(z) is arbitrary, we conclude that kT k\u03b2(p(\u03be),B(\u03be)) \u2264 1, which proves the claim.\nWe denote by SQLp the class of all subquotients of an (abstract) Lp -space. Then SQLp \u2229\nBn is obviously an SQ(p)-class (actually the smallest possible one), formed of all n-dimensional\nsubquotients of Lp . Note that for either p = 1 or p = \u221e, Bn is entirely included in SQLp .\n\n\u22121\nCorollary 11.2. Let 1 \u2264 p0 , p1 \u2264 \u221e and 0 < \u03b8 < 1. Let p be defined by p\u22121 = (1 \u2212 \u03b8)p\u22121\n0 + \u03b8p1 .\nn\nn\nn\nThen, the space (B(lp0 ), B(lp1 ))\u03b8 coincides with the space B(lp ) equipped with the norm\n\n\u2200T \u2208 B(lnp )\n\nkT k = sup kTX k\n\nwhere the supremum runs over all X that can be written as X = X(0) for some compatible family\nof n-dimensional spaces {X(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} such that m({z \u2208 \u2202D | X(z) \u2208 SQLp0 }) = 1 \u2212 \u03b8 and\nm({z \u2208 \u2202D | X(z) \u2208 SQLp1 }) = \u03b8. Let \u03a9(n) denote the class of all such spaces X. Then,\nthe space (B(lp0 ), B(lp1 ))\u03b8 can be identified with the subspace of B(lp ) formed of all T such that\nsup{kTX k | X \u2208 \u03a9(n), n \u2265 1} < \u221e, equipped with the norm\nT 7\u2192 sup{kTX k | X \u2208 \u03a9(n), n \u2265 1},\nprovided we make the convention that if either p0 = \u221e or p1 = \u221e, then B(lp0 ) or B(lp1 ) should be\nreplaced by B(c0 , l\u221e ).\nCorollary 11.3. Let 1 < p < \u221e and 0 < \u03b8 < 1. The unit ball of the space (Br (lnp ), B(lnp ))\u03b8\nconsists of all operators T : lnp \u2192 lnp such that kTX : lnp (X) \u2192 lnp (X)k \u2264 1 for all Banach spaces X\nwhich can be written as X = X(0) where {X(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} is a compatible family of n-dimensional\nBanach spaces such that X(z) is a subquotient of Lp for all z in a subarc of \u2202D of measure \u2265 \u03b8.\nLet SQp (\u03b8, n) denote the class formed of all such spaces.\nLet (\u03a9, \u03bc), (\u03a9\u2032 , \u03bc\u2032 ) be measure spaces. Then the unit ball of (Br (Lp (\u03bc), Lp (\u03bc\u2032 )), B(Lp (\u03bc), Lp (\u03bc\u2032 )))\u03b8\nconsists of those T in B(Lp (\u03bc), Lp (\u03bc\u2032 )) such that\nsup{kTX k | n \u2265 1, X \u2208 SQp (\u03b8, n)} \u2264 1.\nProof. Recall J\u03b8 = {e2\u03c0it | 0 < t < \u03b8}. We apply Theorem 10.1 with p(z) \u2261 p and B(z) = Bn\nfor z in J\u03b8 and B(z) equal to Bn \u2229 SQLp for all z in \u2202D\\J\u03b8 . The second assertion is left to the\nreader.\nCorollary 11.4. Fix 0 < \u03b8 < 1. Consider a measurable partition \u2202D = J0\u2032 \u222a J0\u2032 \u222a J1 with\n|J0\u2032 | = (1 \u2212 \u03b8)/2,\nWe set\n\n|J0\u2032\u2032 | = (1 \u2212 \u03b8)/2,\n\n\uf8f1\nn\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2B(l1 )\nB(z) = B(ln\u221e )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nB(ln2 )\n45\n\nif z \u2208 J0\u2032\nif z \u2208 J0\u2032\u2032\nif z \u2208 J1 .\n\n|J1 | = \u03b8.\n\n\fWe have then isometrically\nB(0) \u2243 (Br (ln2 ), B(ln2 ))\u03b8 .\nProof. Observe that, in this setting, if B(z) consists of all n-dimensional Banach (resp. Hilbert)\nspaces for all z in J0\u2032 \u222a J0\u2032\u2032 (resp. z in J1 ), and if p(z) = 1 on J0\u2032 , p(z) = \u221e on J0\u2032\u2032 and p(z) = 2 on\nJ1 , then in the preceding Theorem we have \u03b2(z) = B(lnp(z) ). Therefore, since B(0) is the class of\nall n-dimensional \u03b8-Hilbertian spaces we have\n\u2200T \u2208 B(ln2 )\n\nkT k\u03b2(0) = sup kTX kB(ln2 (X))\n\nwhere the sup runs over all n-dimensional \u03b8-Hilbertian spaces. Thus we obtain the same as (6.5).\nThe proof of Theorem 11.1 is similar to that of the above Theorem 6.4. We will merely describe\nthe main ingredients.\nLemma 11.5. Given n-dimensional Banach spaces E, F , let \u03b3(z) = \u0393B(z) (E, F ). Then for all\nv : E \u2192 F we have\n\u2200\u03be \u2208 D\n\nkvk\u0393B(\u03be) (E,F ) \u2264 kvk\u03b3(\u03be) .\n\nProof. Assume kvk\u03b3(\u03be) < 1. By definition of \u03b3(\u03be) (see [15]) there is a bounded analytic function\nz \u2192 v(z) on D such that v(\u03be) = v and ess sup\u03b3B(z) (v(z)) < 1. Then we can write (by measurable\nz\u2208\u2202D\n\nv2 (z)\n\nv1 (z)\n\nselection, see 1.9) v(z) = v1 (z)v2 (z) with E \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192X(z) and X(z)\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192F such that kv1 (z)k < 1,\nkv2 (z)k \u2264 1 and X(z) \u2208 B(z) a.e.\nWe now define a compatible family {Y (z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} by setting Y (z) = E equipped with the\nnorm:\n\u2200e \u2208 E\n\nkekY (z) = kv2 (z)ekX(z) \u2264 kek.\n\nWe have then\n(11.4)\n\nkv(z)ekF = kv1 (z)v2 (z)ek \u2264 kekY (z) .\n\nBy density, we may assume v invertible, so that v(\u03be) is invertible and hence v(z) is invertible a.e.\non \u2202D. Moreover, since z 7\u2192 det(v(z)) is bounded and analytic on D and 6= 0 at \u03be, the function\nz 7\u2192 log | det(v(z))| is in L1 (\u2202D). This implies that z \u2192 log kv(z)\u22121 k is in L1 (\u2202D). We have\nk1 (z)kek \u2264 kekY (z)\nwith k1 (z) = kv(z)\u22121 k\u22121 . By the preceding observation, k1 is in L1 (\u2202D), and thus {Y (z) | z \u2208 \u2202D}\nis a compatible family. To conclude, applying the basic interpolation property to (11.4) we find\n\u2200e \u2208 E \u2200\u03be \u2208 D\n\nkv(\u03be)ekF \u2264 kekY (\u03be)\n\nand also\nkekY (\u03be) \u2264 kek.\nSince Y (z) and X(z) are isometric for all z in \u2202D, Y (\u03be) is in B(\u03be) and hence we conclude\n\u03b3B(\u03be) (v) = \u03b3B(\u03be) (v(\u03be)) \u2264 1.\nBy homogeneity (and by the density of invertibles) this completes the proof.\n46\n\n\fGiven a class B \u2282 Bn , we denote by \u0393B (ln1 , ln\u221e ) the space B(ln1 , ln\u221e ) equipped with the norm:\n\u2200u : ln1 \u2192 ln\u221e\n\n\u03b3B (u) = inf{ku1 kku2 k},\nu\n\nu\n\n2\n1\nwhere the infimum runs over all factorizations of u of the form ln1 \u2212\u2192\nX \u2212\u2192\nln\u221e for some X in B.\nn\nn\n\u2217\nn\nn\nWe denote by \u0393B (l\u221e , l1 ) the dual space, i.e. the space B(l\u221e , l1 ) equipped with the dual norm \u03b3B\u2217 .\nMoreover, \u03b3B\u2217 can be described as follows. Assume that B \u2282 Bn is an SQ(p)-class. A linear map\nv : ln\u221e \u2192 ln1 satisfies \u03b3B\u2217 (v) \u2264 1 iff there are \u03bb, \u03bc in the unit ball of respectively lnp\u2032 and lnp and a\nlinear map a : lnp \u2192 lnp such that kak\u03b2(p,B) \u2264 1 and vij = \u03bbi aij \u03bcj for all i, j = 1, . . . , n.\nLet us set\n\n\u2200z \u2208 \u2202D\n\n\u0393(z) = \u0393B(z) (ln1 , ln\u221e ) and\n\n\u0393\u2217 (z) = \u0393\u2217B(z) (ln\u221e , ln1 ).\n\nThen, for all \u03be in D, the space \u0393(\u03be) coincides isometrically with \u0393B(\u03be) (ln1 , ln\u221e ). By duality, \u0393\u2217 (\u03be)\ncoincides with \u0393\u2217B(\u03be) (ln\u221e , ln1 ). Similarly, a linear map w : lnp \u2192 lnp is in the unit ball of \u03b2(p, B)\u2217 iff\nit admits a factorization wij = \u03bbi bij \u03bcj for some \u03bb, \u03bc in the unit ball respectively of lnp and lnp\u2032 and\nsome b in the unit ball of \u0393B (ln1 , ln\u221e ).\nSketch of Proof of Theorem 11.1. By the remark after Theorem 11.1, it remains only to show that\nkT k\u03b2(\u03be) \u2264 kT k\u03b2(p(\u03be),B(\u03be)) . Assume kT k\u03b2(p(\u03be),B(\u03be)) < 1. Consider w in the open unit ball of \u03b2(\u03be)\u2217 . It\nsuffices to show that |hw, T i| \u2264 1. By what precedes, we can write wij = \u03bbi bij \u03bcj with \u03bb, \u03bc in the\nunit ball respectively of lnp(\u03be) and lnp(\u03be)\u2032 and some b in the unit ball of \u0393B(\u03be) (ln1 , ln\u221e ). Then using\n(11.3) both for p(\u03be) and its conjugate p(\u03be)\u2032 , we can conclude by essentially the same reasoning as\nabove for Theorem 6.4.\nNote that if B = Bn then for any a : lnp \u2192 lnp with associated matrix (aij ) we have\nkak\u03b2(p,B) = kakBr (lnp ) = k[|aij |]kB(lnp ) .\nThus, Theorem 11.1 generalizes on one hand the main result of [61] (which corresponds to\nthe case p0 = 1, p1 = \u221e and B(z) = Bn for all z), and on the other hand Theorem 6.4 (which\ncorresponds to the case p0 = p1 = 2 with B(z) = Bn on a set of measure 1 \u2212 \u03b8 and B(z) = {ln2 } on\nthe complement).\nTheorem 11.1 can also be interpreted as the commutation of complex interpolation with the\nduality described at the beginning of \u00a74. Given a class of n-dimensional Banach spaces B, the polar\nof B is the unit ball of a Banach space of operators on lnp . Let us denote the latter Banach space\nby B \u2022 . Then, taking say p(z) constantly equal to p, consider a measurable family of SQ(p)-classes\nof n-dimensional Banach spaces {B(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D}, and for any \u03be \u2208 D let B(\u03be) be as above. The\npreceding result then states that for all \u03be in D\nB(\u03be)\u2022 = B \u2022 (\u03be)\nwhere the right hand side means the result of complex interpolation applied to the family {B \u2022 (z) |\nz \u2208 \u2202D}.\n\n12\n\nOperator space case\n\nThis section is deliberately modeled on section 6: the statement numbered as 12.n in this section\ncorresponds to the one numbered as 6.n in section 6.\n47\n\n\fIn this section, we turn to operator spaces, i.e. closed subspaces X \u2282 B(H) (H Hilbert) equipped\nwith an \"operator space structure,\" i.e. the sequence of normed spaces (Mn (X), k kMn (X) ), where\nk * kMn (X) is simply the norm induced by Mn (B(H)). We refer to [18, 66] for general background on\noperator spaces, completely bounded (in short c.b.) maps, to [64] for notions on non-commutative\nvector-valued Lp -spaces used below, and to [62] for the non-commutative version of \"regular operators\" on the Hilbert\u2013Schmidt class S2 or on more general non-commutative Lp . We first give a\npresentation parallel to \u00a76.\nLet Sp denote the Schatten p-class (1 \u2264 p < \u221e). A mapping T : Sp \u2192 Sp is completely regular\n([62]) iff it is a linear combination of bounded completely positive (c.p. in short) uj , (j = 1, . . . , 4)\nso that u = u1 \u2212 u2 + i(u3 \u2212 u4 ). It is known (see [62]) that u is completely regular iff the map\nuX = u \u2297 IdX is bounded on Sp [X] for any operator space X. Equivalently, this holds iff the\nsequence of maps uMn : Sp [Mn ] \u2192 Sp [Mn ] is uniformly bounded. We define the corresponding\nnorm by:\nkukreg = sup kuMn : Sp [Mn ] \u2192 Sp [Mn ]k,\nn\u22651\n\nand we denote by Br (Sp ) the space of such maps. In analogy with the inclusion Br (l2 ) \u2282 B(l2 ) we\nhave a norm one inclusion Br (Sp ) \u2282 CB(Sp). Therefore, again we may consider the interpolation\nspace (Br (Sp ), CB(Sp ))\u03b8 . For simplicity, we concentrate first on the case p = 2. Unless we specify\notherwise, S2 or any non-commutative L2 -space is assumed equipped with its OH-operator space\nstructure in the sense of [64]\nConsider a compatible family of N -dimensional Banach spaces {X(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} as before.\nAssume that each X(z) is equipped with an operator space structure, such that, for each n \u2265 1,\nthe family {Mn (X(z)) | z \u2208 \u2202D} is compatible. Then we say that {X(z)} is a compatible family\nof operator spaces.\nLet us set Mn (X)(z) = Mn (X(z)). We equip X(0) (resp. X(\u03be) for \u03be \u2208 D) with an operator\nspace structure by setting\n(12.1)\n\nMn (X(0)) = Mn (X)(0)\n\n(resp. Mn (X(\u03be)) = Mn (X)(\u03be)). That this is indeed an operator space structure follows from Ruan's\nfundamental theorem (see [18, p. 33] [66, p. 35]). See [66, 64] for complex interpolation of operator\nspaces.\nNow assume that X(z) is completely isometric to OHn for all z in a set of measure \u2265 \u03b8. Then\nany operator space that is completely isometric to X(0) will be called \u03b8-0-Euclidean (arcwise if\nthe set can be an arc), and any ultraproduct of (resp. arcwise) \u03b8-0-Euclidean spaces will be called\n(resp. arcwise) \u03b8-0-Hilbertian.\nWe should recall that, by the duality of operator spaces for any operator space E, we have\n(12.2)\n\nCB(S1n , E) = Mn (E)\n\nand\n(12.3)\n\nCB(E, Mn ) = Mn (E \u2217 )\n\ncompletely isometrically. Given two operator spaces E, F , we will denote by \u0393OH (E, F ) the space\nof all linear maps u : E \u2192 F wich factor through an operator Hilbert space H equipped with the\no.s. structure of OH in the sense of [64] or [66]. We equip this space with the (Banach space) norm\n\u03b3OH (u) = inf{ku1 kcb ku2 kcb }\n48\n\n\fwhere the infimum runs over all factorizations u2 : E \u2192 H, u1 : H \u2192 F with u = u1 u2 . More\ngenerally, given an operator space X let us denote\n\u03b3X (u) = inf{ku1 kcb ku2 kcb }\nwhere the infimum runs over all possible factorizations of u of the form u = u1 u2 with c.b. maps\nu2 : E \u2192 X and u1 : X \u2192 F . If there is no such factorization, we set \u03b3X (u) = \u221e.\nSimilarly, we will denote by \u0393\u03b8OH (E, F ) the space of maps that factor through a \u03b8-O-Hilbertian\nspace X and we again equip it with the norm \u03b3\u03b8OH (u) = inf{\u03b3X (u)}, with the inf over all \u03b8-OHilbertian spaces X.\nLemma. Assume E = S1n and F = Mn , if u : E \u2192 F factors through an ultraproduct X = \u03a0Xi /U\nof operator spaces, then\n(12.4)\n\n\u03b3X (u) = lim \u03b3Xi (u).\nU\n\nProof. Indeed, by definition of ultraproducts for operator spaces Mn (X) = \u03a0Mn (Xi )/U and hence\nby (12.2) and (12.3) we have an isometric identity\n\u03a0CB(S1n , Xi )/U = CB(S1n , X)\n\n(12.5)\nand an isometric embedding\n(12.6)\n\n\u03a0CB(Xi , Mn )/U \u2282 CB(X, Mn ).\n\nIf dim(Xi ) = d < \u221e for all i, then dim(X) = d and (12.6) becomes an equality because both sides\nhave the same dimension. Now assume u = u1 u2 with c.b. maps u2 : S1n \u2192 X and u2 : X \u2192 Mn .\nBy (12.5) we have maps u2 (i) : S1n \u2192 Xi corresponding to u2 with lim ku2 (i)kcb = ku2 kcb . Let\nU\n\nYi \u2282 Xi be the range of u2 (i) and let Y = \u03a0Yi /U . Clearly Y \u2282 X and dim Y \u2264 n. Consider the\nrestriction v1 = u1|Y : Y \u2192 Mn . We have kv1 kcb = ku1|Y kcb \u2264 ku1 kcb and by the remark following\n(12.6) there are maps v1 (i) : Yi \u2192 Mn corresponding to v1 such that lim kv1 (i)kcb = kv1 kcb . Let\nU\n\nu1 (i) : Xi \u2192 Mn be an extension of v1 (i) with ku1 (i)kcb = kv1 (i)kcb . Let ui = u1 (i)u2 (i). Clearly,\nwe have ui \u2212 u \u2192 0 and lim \u03b3Xi (ui ) \u2264 \u03b3X (u). By an elementary perturbation argument (see [66,\nU\n\np. 69]), since kui (x) \u2212 u(x)k \u2192 0 for all x, there is an isomorphism wi : ui (S1n ) \u2192 u(S1n ) such that\nlim kwi kcb = lim kwi\u22121 kcb = 1 and\nU\n\nU\n\nu = wi ui .\n\nLet w\nei : Mn \u2192 Mn be an extension of wi with kw\nei kcb = kwi kcb so that u = w\nei ui . Thus we obtain\nlim \u03b3Xi (u) \u2264 lim kw\nei kcb \u03b3Xi (ui ) \u2264 \u03b3X (u).\nU\n\nU\n\nThe converse inequality being trivial, this completes the proof of (12.4).\nLemma 12.1. Fix n \u2265 1 and 0 < \u03b8 < 1. Let E, F be n-dimensional operator spaces. Consider a\nlinear map u : E \u2192 F in the unit ball of (CB(E, F ), \u0393OH (E, F ))\u03b8 . Then\n\u03b3\u03b8OH (u) \u2264 1.\nMore precisely, if u is a linear isomorphism, then u admits a factorization u = u1 u2 with ku2 : E \u2192\nXkcb \u2264 1 and ku1 : X \u2192 F kcb \u2264 1 where X = X(0) and X = Y (0) where {X(z)} an {Y (z)} are\ncompatible families of operator spaces such that Y (z) = X(z) \u2243 OHn \u2200z \u2208 J\u03b8 and\nX(z) \u2243 F,\n\nY (z) \u2243 E\n49\n\n\u2200z \u2208\n/ J\u03b8 .\n\n\fProof. The argument for Lemma 6.1 extends without difficulty. We leave the details to the reader.\nTheorem 12.2. Fix n \u2265 1 and 0 < \u03b8 < 1. We have an isometric identity\n(CB(S1n , Mn ), \u0393OH (S1n , Mn ))\u03b8 = \u0393\u03b8OH (S1n , Mn ).\nProof. Consider u : S1n \u2192 Mn with \u03b3\u03b8OH (u) < 1. By (12.4) we may assume that u = u1 u2 with\nu2 : X \u2192 Mn , u1 : S1n \u2192 X satisfying ku1 kcb ku2 kcb < 1 with X a (finite dimensional) \u03b8-OEuclidean space. Assume X = X(0) with X(z) as in the definition of \u03b8-O-Euclidean. Let us define\nCB(S1n , X)(z) and CB(X, Mn )(z) by setting\nCB(S1n , X)(z) = CB(S1n , X(z)) and CB(X, Mn )(z) = CB(X(z), Mn ).\nUsing (12.2), (12.3), and (12.1) we obtain isometric identities\nCB(S1n , X) = CB(S1n , X)(0)\nCB(X, Mn ) = CB(X, Mn )(0)\nfrom which it is easy to derive bounded analytic functions z \u2192 u1 (z) : X(z) \u2192 Mn and z \u2192\nu2 (z) : S1n \u2192 X(z) on S such that u = u1 (0)u2 (0) with\ness sup ku1 (z)kcb ku2 (z)kcb < 1.\nz\u2208\u2202D\n\nBy 5.1, this clearly implies by (12.2) and (12.3), that the norm of u in (CB(S1n , Mn ), \u0393OH (S1n , Mn ))\u03b8\nis < 1. Since the converse direction is a particular case of Lemma 12.1, the proof is complete.\nAs before, if we are given a norm \u03b3 on B(E, F ) (with E, F finite dimensional) we define \u03b3 \u2217 (v)\nfor any v : F \u2192 E by setting\n\u03b3 \u2217 (v) = sup{|tr(uv)| | u : E \u2192 F, \u03b3(u) \u2264 1}.\nWe denote by N0 (v) the operator space version of the nuclear norm of v.\nWe first need to extend Proposition 1.2 to the operator space setting.\nProposition. Consider v : Mn \u2192 S1n .\n\u2217 (v) \u2264 1 iff there are \u03bb , \u03bb , \u03bc , \u03bc in the unit ball of S n and a : S n \u2192 S n in the unit ball\n(i) \u03b3OH\n1 2\n1\n2\n4\n2\n2\nof CB(S2n ) (which, as a Banach space, coincides with B(S2n )) such that\n\n\u2200x \u2208 Mn\n\nv(x) = \u03bc1 a(\u03bb1 x\u03bb2 )\u03bc2 .\n\n(ii) N0 (v) \u2264 1 iff there are \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 in the unit ball of S4n and a : S2n \u2192 S2n in the unit ball\nof Br (S2n ) such that\n\u2200x \u2208 Mn\nProof.\n\nv(x) = \u03bc1 a(\u03bb1 x\u03bb2 )\u03bc2 .\n\n(i) This follows from [63, Th 6.1] and [64, Th 6.8].\n\n50\n\n\f(ii) By [62, Cor. 3.3] we have an isometric identity\n(CB(Mn , Mn ), CB(S1n , S1n )) 1 = Br (S2n , S2n ).\n2\n\nNow consider v such that N0 (v) < 1. Then there are a, b in the open unit ball of S2n such that\nv(x) = \u1e7d(axb) for some \u1e7d : S1n 7\u2192 S1n with k\u1e7dkcb < 1 (see e.g. [64, Th. 5.9 and Rem 5.10]). We\nmay as well assume, by perturbation, that a, b are invertible and positive. Since N0 (v \u2217 ) = N0 (v),\napplying the same argument to v \u2217 : Mn \u2192 S1n and taking adjoints again, we obtain c, d invertible\nand positive in the unit ball of S2n such that\nv(x) = cv\u0302(x)d\nfor some v\u0302 : Mn \u2192 Mn with kv\u0302kcb \u2264 1. Let A(x) = axb, B(x) = cxd. Then, B \u22121 v = v\u0302 and\n\u1e7d = vA\u22121 and hence\nkB \u22121 v : Mn \u2192 Mn kcb < 1 and kvA\u22121 : S1n \u2192 S1n kcb < 1.\nConsider then, again on the strip S, the analytic function f : S \u2192 B(Mn , Mn ) defined by f (z) =\nB z\u22121 vA\u2212z . Since for any real t, B it and Ait are isometric both on Mn and S1n , we have\nkf (z) : Mn \u2192 Mn kcb < 1\n\nfor any\n\nz\n\nin\n\n\u22020\n\nand kf (z) : S1n \u2192 S1n kcb < 1 for any z in \u22021 . This implies kf (1/2) : S2n \u2192 S2n kreg < 1. Thus if we\nset a = f (1/2), we obtain\nv = B 1/2 a(A1/2 x) = \u03bc1 a(\u03bb1 x\u03bb2 )\u03bc2\nwhere \u03bc1 = c1/2 , \u03bc2 = d1/2 , \u03bb1 = a1/2 , \u03bb2 = b1/2 . Conversely assume v(x) = \u03bc1 a(\u03bb1 x\u03bb2 )\u03bc2 with\n\u03bb1 \u03bb2 , \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 as in (ii) and kakreg \u2264 1. The mapping x \u2192 \u03bb1 x\u03bb2 from Mn to S2n corresponds to a\ntensor T in the unit ball of S2n [Mn\u2217 ] (see e.g. [64, Th. 1.5]); the mapping x \u2192 a(\u03bb1 x\u03bb2 ) corresponds\nto (a \u2297 id)(T ) and hence is also in the unit ball of S2n [Mn\u2217 ] (this follows from [62, (2.1) and (2.2)]\nwhich can be checked easily using [64, Lemma 5.4]), therefore the mapping x \u2192 \u03bc1 a(\u03bb1 x\u03bb2 )\u03bc2 is\nalso in the latter ball (cf. e.g. [64, Th. 1.5]). So we conclude that the tensor associated to v is in\nthe unit ball of S1n [Mn\u2217 ] = S1n [S1n ] = S1n \u2297\u2227 S1n = N0 (Mn , S1n ).\nProposition 12.3. Fix n \u2265 1 and 0 < \u03b8 < 1. Consider v : Mn \u2192 S1n . Then v belongs to\nthe unit ball of (N0 (Mn , S1n ), \u0393\u2217OH (Mn , S1n ))\u03b8 iff there are \u03bb1 , \u03bb1 , \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 in the unit ball of S4n and\na : S2n \u2192 S2n in the unit ball of (Br (S2n ), CB(S2n ))\u03b8 such that\n\u2200x \u2208 Mn\n\nv(x) = \u03bc1 a(\u03bb1 x\u03bb2 )\u03bc2 .\n\nProof. The proof of Proposition 6.3 can be easily generalized to the operator space case. We merely\ngive a hint and let the reader check the details. Given v in the open unit ball of (N0 (Mn , S1n ),\n\u0393\u2217OH (Mn , S1n ))\u03b8 , by the preceding Proposition and a measurable selection (see 1.9), we can find an\nanalytic function z \u2192 v(z) such that v(\u03b8) = v that is bounded on S together with measurable\nfunctions on \u2202S z \u2192 \u03bbj (z), z \u2192 \u03bcj (z) (j = 1, 2) with values in the unit ball of S4n , and z \u2192 a(z)\nsuch that a|\u2202j takes its values in the unit ball of Br (S2n ) for j = 0 and in that of B(S2n ) for j = 1,\nsuch that if we define A(z)(x) = \u03bc1 (z)x\u03bc2 (z) and B(z)x = \u03bb1 (z)x\u03bb2 (z), we have for all z in \u2202\n(12.7)\n\nv(z) = B(z)a(z)A(z).\n\n51\n\n\fChoosing \u03b5 > 0 sufficiently small and replacing \u03bbj and \u03bcj (j = 1, 2) respectively by \u03b5I + |\u03bbj | and\n\u03b5I + |\u03bcj |, we may assume that \u03bbj \u2265 \u03b5I and \u03bcj \u2265 \u03b5I. By the matricial Szeg\u00f6 theorem, there are\nbounded Mn -valued analytic functions F1 , F2 , G1 , G2 such that |Fj | = \u03bbj and |Gj | = \u03bcj on \u2202S. We\nnow replace \u03bbj , \u03bcj by Fj , Gj and make the corresponding change of a so that (12.7) holds. Then\nsince z 7\u2192 B(z)\u22121 and z 7\u2192 A(z)\u22121 are analytic, the analyticity of z 7\u2192 v(z) guarantees that of\nz 7\u2192 a(z). It follows that ka(\u03b8)k(Br (S2n ),B(S2n ))\u03b8 \u2264 1. Since v = v(\u03b8), and since Fj (\u03b8), Gj (\u03b8) are (by\nthe maximum principle) in the unit ball of S4n , we conclude that v = v(\u03b8) = B(\u03b8)a(\u03b8)A(\u03b8) can be\nfactorized as stated in Proposition 6.3. This proves the \"only if part.\" The 'if part\" can also be\nchecked by a (simpler) adaptation of the corresponding part of the proof of Proposition 6.3.\nWe can now state the analogue of Theorem 6.4 (recall that CB(S2n ) = B(S2n ) isometrically) .\nTheorem 12.4. Let OH(\u03b8, n) be the set of n-dimensional arcwise \u03b8-0-Hilbertian operator spaces.\nLet 0 < \u03b8 < 1. Consider CB(\u03b8, n) = (Br (S2n ), B(S2n ))\u03b8 . Then, for any T : S2n \u2192 S2n we have\n(12.8)\n\nkT kCB(\u03b8,n) =\n\nsup\nX\u2208OH(\u03b8,n)\n\nkTX kB(S2n [X]) =\n\nsup\nX\u2208OH(\u03b8,n)\n\nkTX kCB(S2n [X]) .\n\nMoreover, the supremum is unchanged if we restrict it to those X = X(0) with X(z) \u2243 S2n \u2200z \u2208 J\u03b8\nand X(z) \u2243 Mn \u2200z \u2208\n/ J\u03b8 , where \u2243 means here completely isometric.\n\nProof. The proof of Theorem 6.4 can be adapted to the operator space framework in the style of\nthe preceding proof. This yields the first equality in (12.8). But on one hand, if X is OH of any\ndimension, the cb-norm of TX is equal to its norm on S2n [X] (cf. [63]), and on the other hand, if\nX is any operator space, the cb-norm of TX on S2n [X] is \u2264 kT kBr (S2n ) (cf. [62, (2.1)]), therefore by\ninterpolation, if X is \u03b8-O-Hilbertian, we have\nkTX kCB(S2n [X]) \u2264 kT kCB(\u03b8,n) .\nThis yields the other equality in (12.8). We leave the remaining details to the reader.\nProposition. In the situation of the preceding theorem, assume that T is a Schur multiplier, i.e.\nT = M\u03c6 , as in Corollary 8.3 above. Then (12.8) and (8.4) are equal.\nProof. Clearly, there is a simultaneously contractive projection on B(S2n ) and on Br (S2n ) onto the\nsubspace formed of all the Schur multipliers. Obviously, on one hand kM\u03c6 kB(S2n ) = k\u03c6kln2 , and on\n\u221e\nthe other hand we claim that\nkM\u03c6 kBr (S2n ) = k\u03c6kM[n] .\nFrom the latter claim, the result becomes clear by general interpolation arguments, so it remains\nonly to check this claim. We will actually show that, for any 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, we have\nkM\u03c6 kBr (Spn ) = k\u03c6kM[n] .\nTo verify this, recall from [62, Cor. 3.3], that, if p\u22121 = \u03b8,\nn\n(CB(S\u221e\n), CB(S1n ))\u03b8 = Br (Spn ).\n\nBut here again the Schur multipliers are simultaneously contractively complemented for the pair\nn ), CB(S n )), therefore the Schur multipliers in B (S n ) can be identified isometrically with\n(CB(S\u221e\nr p\n1\nn ) (resp. CB(S n )) formed by\nthe space (Y0 , Y1 )\u03b8 , where Y0 (resp. Y1 ) denotes the subspace of CB(S\u221e\n1\nthe Schur multipliers, equipped with the induced norm. The proof is then concluded by observing\nthat for all \u03c6 we have\nn ) = k\u03c6kM[n]\nkM\u03c6 kY0 = kM\u03c6 kCB(S\u221e\n\nand kM\u03c6 kY1 = kM\u03c6 kCB(S1n ) = k\u03c6kM[n] .\n\n52\n\n\fThe next three statements are parallel to those of Section 6 and the proofs there are easy to\nadapt.\nRemark 12.5. Consider \u03c6 in B(S2n ). We have\nk\u03c6kCB(\u03b8,n)\u2217 = inf{k\u03bb1 kS4n k\u03bb2 kS4n k\u03bc1 kS4n k\u03bc2 kS4n kvk(CB(S1n ,Mn ),\u0393OH (S1n ,Mn))\u03b8 }\nwhere the infimum runs over all factorizations of \u03c6 of the form \u03c6(x) = \u03bc1 v(\u03bb1 x\u03bb2 )\u03bc2 , \u2200x \u2208 S2n .\n\nLet (M, \u03c4 ), (M\u2032 , \u03c4 \u2032 ) be a pair of semifinite hyperfinite von Neumann algebras equipped with\nsemifinite, normal faithful traces. For any operator space E, the operator space Lp [\u03c4 ; E] was defined\nin [64, Chapter 3], and the regular operators from L2 (\u03c4 ) to L2 (\u03c4 \u2032 ) were introduced in [62]. We\ndenote by Br (L2 (\u03c4 ), L2 (\u03c4 \u2032 )) the normed space of regular maps T : L2 (\u03c4 ) \u2192 L2 (\u03c4 \u2032 ) (this is denoted\nby Br (L2 (\u03c4 ), L2 (\u03c4 \u2032 )) in [62]). We have then\nCorollary 12.6. Let Br = Br (L2 (\u03c4 ), L2 (\u03c4 \u2032 )) and B = B(L2 (\u03c4 ), L2 (\u03c4 \u2032 )). Then the space (Br , B)\u03b8\nconsists of those T in B such that TX is bounded for any \u03b8-O-Hilbertian operator space X. Moreover,\nkT k(Br ,B)\u03b8 =\n\nsup\nn,X\u2208OH(\u03b8,n)\n\nkTX k = sup kTX kcb = sup kTX k\n\nwhere the last two sup run over all arcwise \u03b8-O-Hilbertian operator spaces X.\nLet X be an operator space. For any \u03b5 > 0, we denote by \u22060X (\u03b5) the smallest number \u03b4 such\nthat for any n and any T : S2n \u2192 S2n with kT kreg \u2264 1 and kT k \u2264 \u03b5 we have kTX k \u2264 \u03b4.\nCorollary 12.7. Assume that an operator space X satisfies \u22060X (\u03b5) \u2208 O(\u03b5\u03b1 ) for some \u03b1 > 0. Then\nfor any 0 < \u03b8 < \u03b1, X is completely isomorphic to a subquotient of a \u03b8-O-Hilbertian space.\nTheorem 12.8. Let C \u2265 1 be a constant. The following properties of an operator space X are\nequivalent:\n(i) There is an operator space Y that is a quotient of a subspace of an arcwise \u03b8-O-Hilbertian\nspace and a complete isomorphism w : X \u2192 Y such that kwkcb kw\u22121 kcb \u2264 C.\n(ii) kTX k \u2264 C for any n and any T such that kT k(Br (S2n ),B(S2n ))\u03b8 \u2264 1.\nRemark. Let u : Z \u2192 Y be a linear map between operator spaces. Then\n\u03b3\u03b8OH (u) = sup sup{kT \u2297 u : S2n [Z] \u2192 S2n [Y ]k}\nn\n\nwhere the second sup runs over all T : S2n \u2192 S2n such that sup{kTX k | X \u03b8-O-Hilbertian} \u2264 1.\nThis is easy to check by a simple adaptation of [29].\nThe cb-distance dcb (E, F ) between two operator spaces is defined by:\ndcb (E, F ) = inf{kukcb ku\u22121 kcb }\nwhere the infimum runs over all complete isomorphisms u : E \u2192 F . If there exists no such u, we\nset dcb (E, F ) = \u221e.\n\nRemark. An operator space may be Hilbertian as a Banach space while being \u03b8-O-Hilbertian for no\n0 < \u03b8 < 1. The simplest examples are the spaces R = span[e1n ] \u2282 B(l2 ) and C = span[en1 ] \u2282 B(l2 ).\nThe fact that they are not \u03b8-O-Hilbertian follows from the observation any n-dimensional \u03b8-OEuclidean space En must satisfy\n\u221a\n(12.9)\ndcb (En , OHn ) \u2264 ( n)\u03b8\n53\n\n\fwhile it is known that\n(12.10)\n\ndcb (Rn , OHn ) = dcb (Cn , OHn ) =\n\n\u221a\n\nn.\n\nWe refer the reader [66, p. 219] for (12.10), and finally to [64, Th. 6.9] and a simple interpolation\nargument for (12.9)\nRemark. There is no significant difficulty to extend the results of \u00a710 to the operator space setting\nbut we choose to skip the details.\n\n13\n\nGeneralizations (Operator space case)\n\nIn this section, we briefly describe the extension of the results in \u00a711 to the operator space case. The\nextension of statement 11.n will be numbered 13.n. All the background for this extension can be\nfound in [64, chapter 7] to which we refer the reader. The main difference from the Banach space\ncase is the lack of local reflexity of (general) operator spaces: in the Banach case, any operator\nu : E \u2192 F such that \u03b3SQLp (u) < 1 can be factorized with constant < 1 through a subspace\nof quotient of lm\np for some m finite, but in the operator space analogue, for u : E \u2192 F with\n\u03b3SQOLp (u) < 1 we can only assert that there is a subquotient of an ultraproduct of the family\n{Spm | m \u2265 1}, through which u factors, with cb-norms < 1. However, if E = S1n (or merely a\nquotient of S1n ) and F = Mn (or merely a subspace of Mn ), then we can replace this ultraproduct\nby Spm for some finite m. See [64, pp. 81\u201382] (and also [35]) for clarifications.\nLet \u03b4cb (E, F ) = logdcb (E, F ). Let OSn denote the set of all n-dimensional operator spaces,\nwhere, by convention, we identify two spaces if they are completely isometric. Then (OS\nS n , \u03b4cb ) is a\ncomplete (non-separable) metric space, see e.g. [66, chapter 21]. For any subset B \u2282 n OSn and\nany linear mapping u : E \u2192 F between finite dimensional operator spaces, we set\n\u03b3cB (u) = inf{ku1 kcb ku2 kcb }\n\nu\n\nu\n\n2\n1\nwhere the infimum runs over all X in B and all possible factorizations E \u2212\u2192\nX \u2212\u2192\nF of u through\nX. We will say that B is an SQO(p) class if it contains all the subquotients of ultraproducts of\nspaces of the form lp ({Sp [Xi ] | i \u2208 I}) with Xi \u2208 B for all i in I, I being an arbitrary finite set.\nWe also always assume C \u2208 B. Then it is easy to check that u \u2192 \u03b3cB (u) is a norm on CB(E, F )\n(say with E, F finite dimensional). We denote by \u0393cB (E, F ) the resulting normed space. We will\ndenote by SQOLp the class of all subquotients of ultraproducts of {Spm | m \u2265 1}. Clearly this is\nan example of SQO(p)-class.\nFor any z in \u2202D, we give ourselves p(z) in [1, \u221e] and a subset B(z) \u2282 OSn . We will assume\nz \u2192 p(z) Borel measurable and z 7\u2192 B(z) \"measurable\" in the following sense: for any operator\nu : E \u2192 F between two finite dimensional operator spaces, the mapping z 7\u2192 \u03b3B(z) (u) is measurable\non \u2202D. We assume that B(z) is an SQO(p(z))-class for any z in \u2202D.\nWe then define p(\u03be) and B(\u03be), for \u03be in D, exactly as in \u00a711. Given 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e and an\nSQO(p)-class B \u2282 OSn2 , we denote by c\u03b2(p, B) the space CB(Spn ) equipped with the norm\n\n\u2200T \u2208 CB(Spn )\n\nkT kc\u03b2(p,B) = sup kTX : Spn [X] \u2192 Spn [X]kcb .\nX\u2208B\n\nWe prefer not to worry about measurability questions here, so we will assume that z 7\u2192 B(z) is\nchosen so that z 7\u2192 kT kc\u03b2(p(z),B(z)) is measurable for any T in CB(Spn ). Then if we set\nc\u03b2(z) = c\u03b2(p(z), B(z))\nthe family {c\u03b2(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} is compatible, and hence extends, by complex interpolation, to a family\n{c\u03b2(\u03be) | \u03be \u2208 D}. The next statement identifies c\u03b2(\u03be).\n54\n\n\fTheorem 13.1. For any \u03be in D we have a completely isometric identity c\u03b2(\u03be) = c\u03b2(p(\u03be), B(\u03be)).\n\u22121\nCorollary 13.2. Let 1 \u2264 p0 , p1 \u2264 \u221e and 0 < \u03b8 < 1. Define p by p\u22121 = (1 \u2212 \u03b8)p\u22121\n0 + \u03b8p1 . Then\nn\nn\nn\nthe space (CB(Sp0 ), CB(Sp1 ))\u03b8 coincides with the space CB(Sp ) equipped with the norm\n\nkT k = sup{kTX : Spn [X] \u2192 Spn [X]k\n\n\u2200T \u2208 CB(Spn )\n\nwhere the supremum runs over all X that can be written as X = X(0) for some compatible family of\nn2 -dimensional operator spaces {X(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} such that m({z \u2208 \u2202D | X(z) \u2208 SQOLp0 }) = 1 \u2212 \u03b8\nand m({z \u2208 \u2202D | X(z) \u2208 SQOLp1 }) = \u03b8. Let \u03a9o (n2 ) denote the class of all such spaces X. Then\nthe space (CB(Sp0 ), CB(Sp1 ))\u03b8 can be identified with the subspace of CB(Sp ) formed of all T such\nthat\n(13.1)\n\nT 7\u2192 sup{kTX : Sp [X] \u2192 Sp [X]k | X \u2208 \u03a9o (n2 ), n \u2265 1}\n\nis finite, equipped with the norm (13.1), provided we make the convention that if either p0 = \u221e or\np1 = \u221e, CB(Sp0 ) or CB(Sp1 ) are replaced by CB(S\u221e , B(l2 )).\nCorollary 13.3. Let 1 < p < \u221e and 0 < \u03b8 < 1. The unit ball of (Br (Spn ), CB(Spn ))\u03b8 consists of\nall operators T : Spn \u2192 Spn such that kTX : Spn [X] \u2192 Spn [X]k \u2264 1 for all operator spaces X that can\nbe written as X = X(0) where {X(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} is a compatible family of n2 -dimensional operator\nspaces such that X(z) is a subquotient of an ultraproduct of {Spm | m \u2265 1} for all z in a subarc of\nmeasure \u2265 \u03b8. Let SQOp (\u03b8, n2 ) be the class of all such spaces.\nLet (M, \u03c4 ) and (M \u2032 , \u03c4 \u2032 ) be hyperfinite von Neumann algebras equipped with semifinite, normal\nfaithful traces. Then the unit ball of\nBr (Lp (\u03c4 ), Lp (\u03c4 \u2032 )), CB(Lp (\u03c4 ), Lp (\u03c4 \u2032 )))\u03b8\nconsists of those T in CB(Lp (\u03c4 ), Lp (\u03c4 \u2032 )) such that\n(13.2)\n\nsup{kTX : Lp (\u03c4 ; X) \u2192 Lp (\u03c4 \u2032 ; X)k | X \u2208 SQOp (\u03b8, n) n \u2265 1} \u2264 1.\n\nCorollary 13.4. Fix 0 < \u03b8 < 1. Consider a measurable partition \u2202D = J0\u2032 \u222a J0\u2032 \u222a J1 with\n|J0\u2032 | = (1 \u2212 \u03b8)/2,\nWe set\n\nWe have then isometrically\n\n|J0\u2032\u2032 | = (1 \u2212 \u03b8)/2,\n\n\uf8f1\nn\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2CB(S1 )\nB(z) = CB(Mn )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nB(S2n )\n\n|J1 | = \u03b8.\n\nif z \u2208 J0\u2032\nif z \u2208 J0\u2032\u2032\nif z \u2208 J1 .\n\nB(0) \u2243 (Br (S2n ), B(S2n ))\u03b8 .\n\nThe proof of Lemma 10.4 extends with routine modifications and yields:\nLemma 13.5. Given n-dimensional operator spaces E, F . Let c\u03b3(z) = \u0393cB(z) (E, F ). Then for all\nw : E \u2192 F we have\n\u2200\u03be \u2208 D\n\nkwk\u0393cB(\u03be) (E,F ) \u2264 kwkc\u03b3(\u03be) .\n\n55\n\n\f14\n\nExamples with the Haagerup tensor product\n\nUsing Kouba's interpolation theorem ([39]) we will produce some interesting examples of compatible\nfamilies of operator spaces involving quite naturally more than 2 spaces. Let J(1), J(2), . . . , J(d)\nbe arbitrary measurable subsets of \u2202D.\nWe will denote for j = 1, 2, . . . , d\nJ0 (j) = J(j),\n\nJ1 (j) = \u2202D\\J(j).\n\nThen for any \u03b5 = (\u03b5(j)) in {0, 1}d we set\nJ\u03b5 = J\u03b5(1) (1) \u2229 * * * \u2229 J\u03b5(d) (d).\nNote that {J\u03b5 | \u03b5 \u2208 {0, 1}d } is a partition of \u2202D into 2d measurable subsets.\nNow let (A10 , A11 ), . . . , (Ad0 , Ad1 ) be d compatible pairs of finite dimensional operator spaces. We\ndefine a compatible family {X(z) | z \u2208 \u2202D} by setting\nX(z) = A1\u03b5(1) \u2297h * * * \u2297h Ad\u03b5(d) .\n\n\u2200z \u2208 J\u03b5\n\nTheorem 14.1. We have a completely isometric identification\nX(0) \u2243 (A10 , A11 )\u03b81 \u2297h * * * \u2297h (Ad0 , Ad1 )\u03b8d\nwhere \u03b8j = m(J1 (j)).\nProof. Kouba's theorem (cf. [39]) for the Haagerup tensor product implies the following (see [64]):\nLet {A(z)} and {B(z)} be two compatible families of finite dimensional operator spaces. Let\nT (z) = A(z) \u2297h B(z). Then {T (z)} is a compatible family such that\nT (0) \u2243 A(0) \u2297h B(0)\ncompletely isometrically.\nIn other words, the operations X \u2192 X(0) (interpolation) and X, Y \u2192 X \u2297h Y (Haagerup tensor\nproduct) are commuting. In the situation of Theorem 14.1, we may iterate the preceding and we\nobtain\nX(0) \u2243 X 1 (0) \u2297h * * * \u2297h X d (0)\nwhere X j (z) is defined by\n\n(\nAj0\nX j (z) =\nAj1\n\nBy [15, Cor. 5.1], we have then\n\nif z \u2208 J0 (j)\n.\nif z \u2208 J1 (j)\n\nX j (0) = (Aj0 , Aj1 )\u03b8j\n\nwhere \u03b8j = m(J1 (j)) (recall m is the normalized Lebesgue measure on \u2202D).\nIn operator space theory, the pair (R, C) of row and column Hilbert spaces plays a fundamental\nr\u00f4le. It was studied as an interpolation pair in [64] (see also [66]). We use transposition R \u2192 C (or\nC \u2192 R) to identify an element of R with one in C for the purposes of interpolation. This allows\nus to view (R, C) as a compatible pair. Let C[\u03b8] = (R, C)\u03b8 . Then C[\u03b8] can be identified with the\nsubspace of column vectors in the Schatten class Sp for p = (1 \u2212 \u03b8)\u22121 . So we set\n(14.1)\n\nC[p] = C[1 \u2212 1/p] = (R, C)1\u22121/p = (C, R)1/p .\n56\n\n\fLet \u03b8j \u2265 0 be such that \u03b80 + \u03b81 + * * * + \u03b8d = 1. Let \u22060 \u222a * * * \u222a \u2206d be a partition of \u2202D into arcs so\nthat m(\u2206j ) = \u03b8j . For any z in \u2206j we set\n(14.2)\n\nK(z) = C \u2297h * * * \u2297h C \u2297h R \u2297 * * * \u2297h R\n\nwhere the product has its j first factors equal to C and the following d \u2212 j equal to R. Let Kj be\nspace appearing on the right-hand side of (14.2). It is well known (see [18] or [66, p. 96]) that Kj\n\u2297(d\u2212j)\ncan be identified with the compact operators from l2\nto l\u2297j\n2 , and in the extreme case j = 0\n\u2297d\n(resp. j = d) we find l2 with its row (resp. column) operator space structure.\nThe space K0 \u2229 K1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Kd has already appeared in Harmonic Analysis over F\u221e , the free\ngroup with countably infinitely many generators {gi }. Indeed, it was shown in [7] (in [25] for the\nd = 1 case) that K0 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Kd can be identified with the closed span in C\u03bb\u2217 (F\u221e ) of {\u03bb(gi1 gi2 . . . gid ) |\ni1 , i2 , . . . , id \u2208 N}. For an extension of this to the non-commutative Lp -space over F\u221e , see [54].\nThese results motivated us to study the interpolation spaces associated to the family K(z) defined\nby (14.2). Curiously, one can identify them quite easily:\nCorollary 14.2. We have a completely isometric identity\nK(0) \u2243 C[p0 ] \u2297h C[p1] * * * \u2297h C[pd\u22121 ]\nwhere\npj = (\u03b80 + \u03b81 + * * * + \u03b8j )\u22121 .\nNote that p0 \u2265 p1 \u2265 * * * \u2265 pd\u22121 .\nProof. By routine arguments (particularly easy here because of the \"homogeneity\" of the spaces R\nand C), one can reduce to the case when R, C are replaced by their n-dimensional version Rn , Cn .\nTo lighten the notation, we ignore this and still denote them by R, C. Then the corollary follows\nfrom Theorem 14.1, once one observes that if we use\n(Aj0 , Aj1 ) = (C, R)\nand set\nJ1 (j) = \u22060 \u222a * * * \u222a \u2206j\u22121\nwe find that if z \u2208 \u2206j\n\n(1 \u2264 j \u2264 d),\n\nX 1 (z) \u2297h * * * \u2297h X d (z) = Kj .\n\nTherefore, to conclude it suffices to calculate m(J1 (j)) = \u03b80 + * * * + \u03b8j\u22121 = (pj\u22121 )\u22121 and to recall\n(14.1).\n\nReferences\n[1] Bergh, J.
