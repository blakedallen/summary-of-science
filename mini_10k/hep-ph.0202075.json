The Standard Model (SM) requires\nan extreme fine tuning to maintain this hierarchy and a lot of recent work has addressed this\n\"Hierarchy Problem\". Supersymmetry, Technicolor and recently, extra dimensions [1] [2],\nhave been considered to address this problem.\nOne of the frameworks that addresses the hierarchy problem was proposed by Randall\nand Sundrum [2]. They propose a 5-dimensional non-factorizable AdS geometry with the\nmetric given by:\nds2 = gM N dxM dxN = g\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + dy 2 = e\u22122k|y| \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 dx\u03b1 dx\u03b2 + dy 2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere, k is the AdS curvature, y is the co-ordinate in the extra dimension and \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 is\ndiag(\u22121, 1, 1, 1).\nThe extra dimension is compactified on S 1 /Z2 . The Z2 symmetry identifies y and \u2212y\nand fields are either even or odd with respect to this Z2 :\n\u03a6(x, \u2212y) = \u00b1\u03a6(x, y).\n\n(2)\n\nThe Lagrangian is constructed to be be Z2 invariant. In this setup there are two 3-branes at\nthe Z2 orbifold fixed points - the \"Planck Brane\" at y = 0, and the \"TeV Brane\" at y = \u03c0R.\nThe \"warp factor\", e\u22122k|y| , allows the possibility of generating an exponentially lower ElectroWeak scale, given a high Planck scale; MEW \u2248 e\u2212k\u03c0R Mpl , with R the radius of the compact\nextra dimension. To generate the required hierarchy we need kR \u2248 12 with k \u223c Mpl . In the\noriginal framework, to solve the hierarchy problem, matter was thought to reside on the TeV\nbrane; later authors have considered matter on the Planck brane also. A generic feature of\n\nRandall-Sundrum type theories is that it requires the cosmological constants in the bulk and\nthe two branes to be fine-tuned\u2217 .\n\u039b = \u22126M53 k 2\n\u039b\n(3)\n\u039b(0) = \u2212\u039b(\u03c0R) = \u2212\nk\nwhere M5 is the fundamental five-dimensional scale. The four dimensional Planck scale is:\nMpl2 =\n\u2217\n\nM53\n(1 \u2212 e\u22122\u03c0kR ).\nk\n\n(4)\n\nRef. [3] describes a mechanism to stabilize the radius of the compact extra dimension and reduce the\nnumber of fine-tunings to one.\n\n1\n\n\fIn this paper, we work in this framework of Randall and Sundrum.\nGrand Unified Theories (GUT) based on SU(5) have many compelling features[4]. The\nquantum numbers of particles in the SM can be neatly explained by considering them to\nbe in the 10 and 5\u0304 representations. Another motivation to consider GUTs is the apparent\nunification of gauge couplings at around MGU T \u223c 1016 GeV, in the Minimal Supersymmetric\nStandard Model (MSSM) [5].\nOur motivation for considering extra dimensional gauge fields is the possibility of bulk\ngauge fields mediating supersymmetry breaking through Gaugino Mediation [6]. In this\nscheme, a gauge supermultiplet in the bulk of a flat higher dimensional theory transmits\nsupersymmetry breaking at a TeV from the source brane to the MSSM fields on a second\nbrane. The realization of Gaugino Mediation in the context of the Randall-Sundrum scenario\nis left for future work.\nMotivated by these considerations we consider a setup with SU(5) gauge bosons in the\nbulk of the Randall-Sundrum setup. We consider matter in the 10 and 5\u0304 representations of\nSU(5) to be localized on a brane. Pomarol [11] has considered breaking SU(5) by a Higgs\nmechanism on the matter brane in the Randall-Sundrum scenario. In this paper we calculate\nthe proton decay rate due to terms with an X boson and also due to non-renormalizable\ninteraction terms containing \u2202y X.\n\n2\n\nThe SU(5) Lagrangian\n\nIn the following, only terms relevant for proton decay will be shown. The SU(5) generators\nare denoted as T a , normalized as {T a , T b} = 12 \u03b4 ab and y0 is the position of the matter brane.\nThe field strength for the bulk gauge field AaM (of mass dimension 3/2) is defined as:\nFM N = \u2202M AN \u2212 \u2202N AM \u2212 ig [AM , AN ]\na\na\na\na\nFM N = FM\nN T ; AM = AM T , etc.\nand the covariant derivatives for the usual GUT matter multiplets, T the 10 of SU(5) and\nF\u0304 the 5\u0304 of SU(5) is given by:\nD\u03bc T = \u2202\u03bc T \u2212 i \u221a e (A\u03bc T + T AT\u03bc )\n2Mpl\n\nD\u03bc F = \u2202\u03bc F \u2212 i \u221a e\n\n2Mpl\n\nA\u03bc F .\n\nThe SU(5) invariant lagrangian is:\nL = LBulk + LBrane\n\n(5)\n2\n\n\fLBulk =\nLBrane \u2283\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\n\u2212g\n\n\u0014\n\n1\nT r(F M N FM N )\n2\n\uf8ee\n\n\u0015\n\n(6)\n\n\u2212g \u03b4(y \u2212 y0 ) \uf8f0T r(T\u0304 iDT\n/ )+\n\n+ F\u0304 iDF\n/ +\n\nig2\n\nq\n\nMCO Mpl\n\n\u0010\n\nig1\nq\n\nMCO Mpl\n\nh\n\ni\n\nF\u0304 \u03b3 M , \u03b3 N FM N\n\n\u0010\n\nh\n\ni\n\nT r T\u0304 \u03b3 M , \u03b3 N FM N T\n\uf8f9\n\u0011\nF \uf8fb\n\n\u0011\n\n(7)\n\nwhere, g is the determinant of the 5-dimensional metric \u2020 , \u03b3M = e\u03b1M \u03b3\u03b1 (e\u03b1M is the vierbein\nand \u03b3\u03b1 are the flat space Dirac matrices) and the second and fourth terms above are nonrenormalizable interaction terms that are Lorentz and SU(5) invariant, suppressed by the\ncutoff scale MCO , and e, g1 and g2 are O(1) coupling constants .\nFor the Lagrangian to be Z2 invariant, AaM should have the property:\nAa\u03bc (x, \u2212y) = +Aa\u03bc (x, y)\n\n(8)\n\nAa5 (x, \u2212y) = \u2212Aa5 (x, y)\n\n(9)\n\ni.e., Aa\u03bc is Z2 even and Aa5 is Z2 odd.\nThe equations of motion for the AaM are:\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2202\u03b1 \u2202 \u03b1 Aa5 \u2212 \u2202y \u2202\u03b1 Aa\u03b1 = 0\n\n\u0010\n\ne2k|y| \u2202y e\u22122k|y| \u2202y Aa\u03b2 \u2212 \u2202 \u03b2 Aa5\n\n\u0011\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n(10)\n\u0011\n\n+ e2k|y| \u2202\u03b1 \u2202 \u03b1 Aa\u03b2 \u2212 \u2202 \u03b2 Aa\u03b1 = 0.\n\n(11)\n\nUsing the gauge freedom, we can always set \u2202\u03bc Aa\u03bc = 0.

There are various ways of breaking SU(5) and one of them is by a Higgs confined to\nthe matter brane. Let us consider a Higgs in the adjoint of SU(5) localized on the matter\nbrane [11] and that it gets a VEV, breaking SU(5) down to SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) in the\nusual manner [4].\n\nThe Higgs mechanism results in a mass term for the X and Y bosons which effectively\ncan be parametrized as:\nLBrane \u2283\n\n\u221a\n\nv2\nM\n\u2212g \u03b4(y \u2212 y0 )\nA\u00e2M A\u00e2\nMpl\n\n(24)\n\nwhere, v is the VEV of the Higgs that breaks SU(5) to SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1). We will not\nshow terms containing the physical Higgs since we are interested in calculating the proton\ndecay contribution due to the gauge bosons. We will work in the Unitary gauge where we\nonly deal with physical particles.\nThe equation of motion for gauge bosons (eq.

The matter content on the Planck\nBrane is that of the MSSM and the gauge couplings apparently unify [11] [12] in the usual\nmanner\u2217\u2217 , at around MGU T \u223c 1016 GeV.\nEquating eqs.

The corresponding limit for the wavefunction\nfrom eq. (17) is fn (y) = constant.\n\nNow we ask whether this \"zero-mode\" becomes massive due to a non-zero v. For u \u226a 1,\n\nthe right hand side of eq. (32) can be approximated using eq.

[13] point out that there may be large threshold corrections that upset gauge\ncoupling unification, but there is still the possibility that the threshold corrections are universal and preserve\nunification.\n\n6\n\n\for equivalently,\n\nv\n.\nm0 = q\n\u03c0Mpl R\n\n(35)\n\nIt should be stressed that this solution for the lowest mode is valid in the limit u \u226a 1, i.e.,\nv \u226a 103 GeV. Thus the mode that was massless is now lifted to the value given by eq. (35)\ndue to a non-zero v. We are actually interested in the case when v \u223c MGU T for which we\n\ncannot use the above solution obtained for u \u226a 1. A numerical computation of eq. (32)\nshows that as v becomes larger than about 104 GeV the lowest mode gets fixed at around\nthe first zero of Y0 , u0 \u2248 0.9, or equivalently m0 \u2248 0.9ke\u2212k\u03c0R \u223c TeV. Thus we see that the\nzero mode is lifted to a mass of \u223c TeV due to a VEV v \u223c MGU T . The wavefunction of this\n\n\"zero-mode\" is similar to the wavefunction of the first KK mode since their masses are close.\n\nWe can see from eq. (32) that the low lying KK modes, un , are close to the zero's of the\n\u0011\n\u0010\nBessel function J0 , namely, un \u2248 n \u2212 41 \u03c0 which translates to:\n\n1\n\u03c0ke\u2212k\u03c0R .\n(36)\n4\nThus, a non-zero v doesn't significantly change the mass spectrum from the v = 0 case (see\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nmn \u2248 n \u2212\n\nfor example ref. [10]). We will estimate the wavefunctions at y = 0 in the next section and\nwe will see that it changes drastically when a VEV is turned on.\n\n3.2\n\nMatter on the TeV brane\n\nWe will show in the next section that having matter on the TeV brane violates the experimental limit on the proton decay. Phenomenological disadvantages of having matter on the\nTeV brane with gauge fields in the bulk are discussed in ref. [9].\n\n4\n\nProton Decay due to Gauge Bosons\n\nThe dominant contribution to proton decay comes from tree level exchange of the X and Y\n \u0304 It should be noted that X5 and Y5 do not induce proton\nbosons such as uu \u2192 X\u03bc \u2192 e+ d.\ndecay, since, being Z2 odd, they vanish at the fixed points (where matter is localized).\n\nThe proton decay rate due to the tree level exchange of the nth KK mode of X\u03bc given\nby the first term in eq. (23) is:\n\u0393(n) \u2248\n\n(efn (y0 ))4 m5p\n4 (2\u03c0Mpl R)2 MX(n)4\n7\n\n(37)\n\n\fwhere, mp is the Proton mass, \u223c 1 GeV. The tree level contribution due to the nth KK\nmode of \u2202y X\u03bc given by the second term in eq. (23) is:\n\u0393(n) \u223c\n\nm5p\n(2g1 \u2202y fn (y0 ))4\n.\n(2\u03c0Mpl R)2 (MCO )4 MX(n)4\n\n(38)\n\nSumming over the KK modes gives the total decay rate,\nv\n1X\nT eV\n1\n\u0393(n) .\n\u0393=\n\u223c\n\u03c4p\nn=1\n\n(39)\n\nThe sum is over the modes that are of mass less than v and since the spacing of modes is\napproximately a TeV, we have cut the sum off at\n\nv\n1 T eV\n\nabove.\n\nIf matter is on the TeV brane, eq. (17) implies that fn (\u03c0R) \u223c O(1) with mn \u223c n TeV.\nEq. (37) implies \u0393(1) \u223c 10\u221212 GeV, i.e. \u03c4p(1) \u223c 10\u221220 yr, and the experimental bound on the\nproton decay rate\u2020\u2020 is clearly violated. Thus, in agreement with ref. [11] we conclude that\nwe cannot have matter on the TeV brane.\n\nFor matter on the Planck brane, we estimate the value of the wavefunction and its\nderivative along the extra dimension at y = 0. From eqs. (29) and (17) with mkn \u226a 1\u2021\u2021 ,\n\nv > mn , y0 = 0 and Nn from eq.

(37) gives the proton decay rate due to the nth KK mode: \u0393(n) \u223c 10\u2212114 n2 and thus\nthe total decay rate given by eq. (39) due to the first term in eq. (23) is \u0393 \u223c 10\u221275 GeV, i.e.\n\u03c4p \u223c 1043 yr.\nWe calculate next the contribution due to the term with the derivative on the X boson\nalong the extra dimension given by the second term in eq. (23). Using eq. (42) in eq. (38)\n\u221261 2\n\ngives \u0393(n) \u223c 10M 4 n . With MCO \u223c 1016 GeV and summing over the KK modes, the total\nCO\nrate due to the second term in eq. (23) is: \u0393 \u223c 10\u221286 GeV i.e. \u03c4p \u223c 1054 yr.\n\u2020\u2020\n\nThe experimental limit on the proton lifetime is (mode dependent) \u03c4p > 1031 \u2212 5 \u00d7 1032 years [7] which\ntranslates to \u03c4p \u223c 1064 (GeV)\u22121 .\n\u2021\u2021\nFrom eq. (36) this means that all these estimates are valid for n \u226a 1016 and not for arbitrarily large n.\n\n8\n\n\fThus the lifetime is far greater than the experimental limit and we conclude that it is\nacceptable to have matter on the Planck brane.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nWe considered a setup based on the Randall-Sundrum scenario which addresses the hierarchy\nproblem. This consists of having a warped geometry compactified on S 1 /Z2, with the\nMSSM matter fields localized on one of the fixed points of the orbifold. We considered\nthe implications to proton decay due to SU(5) gauge bosons in the bulk.\nWe considered the situation when SU(5) is broken by an adjoint Higgs on the matter\nbrane breaking it down to SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1). We calculated the proton decay rate due\nto exchange of X bosons and considered the effect of a non-renormalizable interaction term\non the brane having a derivative in the y direction. Another way of breaking SU(5) is by\n\nOrbifold breaking which was not considered here. It is possible that the contributions to\nproton decay can be different in Orbifold breaking due to the different Z2 parity properties\nof the gauge bosons, although we expect the results to be qualitatively similar.\nWe found that the experimental limit on the proton decay rate does not allow matter\nto be on the TeV brane. We then calculated the proton decay rate if the 10 and 5\u0304 matter\nmultiplets of SU(5) was on the Planck brane. We showed that this does not violate the\nexperimental limit and thus is a viable setup.\nHaving matter on the Planck brane implies the hierarchy problem and thus requires\nSupersymmetry to stabilize the Higgs at the Weak scale. Though it might seem that we\nlost the original motivation of solving the hierarchy problem, we note here that there is\nstill the attractive feature of generating the Weak scale due to the warped geometry, given\nthe Planck scale. One realization of this is that some dynamics on the TeV brane might\nbreak supersymmetry at the TeV scale and then be communicated by the Gauginos in the\nbulk to the MSSM on the Planck brane. We have not considered the Higgs and Higgsino\ncontributions to Proton Decay here. It would also be interesting to consider if it is possible\nto have the Higgs in the bulk while satisfying proton decay constraints.\nAcknowledgments: I would like to thank J.
