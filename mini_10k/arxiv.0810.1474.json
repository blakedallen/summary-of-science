Introduction\nIn one-dimensional real and complex dynamics, there are several conditions which guarantee some form of non-uniform hyperbolicity, which in turn gives a reasonable understanding on statistical and geometric properties of the dynamics. Classical examples include\nthe Misiurewicz condition [12], semi-hyperbolicity [5] and the Collet-Eckmann condition\n(CE) [6, 10, 2, 13, 15, 14, 17, 18, 9, 19]. More recent examples include the Topological\nCollet-Eckmann condition (T CE) [14, 19, 20], summability conditions [16, 8, 3] and the\nCollet-Eckmann condition for recurrent critical orbits (RCE) [22, 11].\nIn the setting of rational dynamics, CE implies T CE [9, 20], but there are T CE polynomials which do not verify the CE condition [20]. Graczyk asked whether RCE is equivalent\nto T CE. In a previous paper, the author showed that RCE implies T CE [11]. Here, we\nshow that the converse is not true.\nTheorem A. There exists a T CE rational map that is not RCE.\nOn the interval, T CE is equivalent to CE in the S-unimodal setting [15, 14], thus CE\nis a topological invariant. However, with more than one critical point this is no longer\ntrue. \u015awia\u0327tek conjectured that RCE is topologically invariant for multimodal analytic\nmaps with negative Schwarzian derivative [22]. We show this conjecture to be false.\nTheorem B. In interval dynamics, the RCE condition for S-multimodal analytic maps is\nnot topologically invariant.\n1.1. History. In one-dimensional dynamics, the orbits of critical points (zeros of the derivative in the smooth case) play a special role. Conditions on critical orbits and their\nconsequences for the dynamics were first studied in the context of interval dynamics.\nTwo important results in this direction were published in 1981. Misiurewicz showed that\nS-unimodal maps with non-recurrent critical orbit have an absolutely continuous invariant\n1\n\n\f2\n\nNICOLAE MIHALACHE\n\nprobability measure [12], see Definitions 2.9 and 2.18. Jakobson proved that real quadratic\nmaps which have such invariant measures are abundant, that is, the set of their parameters\nis of positive measure [10]. Collet and Eckmann introduced the CE condition and showed\nthat S-unimodal CE maps have absolutely continuous invariant probability measures [6].\nBenedicks and Carleson showed that CE maps are abundant in the quadratic family [2].\nNowicki and Sands showed that CE is equivalent to several non-uniform hyperbolicity\nconditions for S-unimodal maps [13, 15]. One of them is Uniform Hyperbolicity on repelling Periodic orbits (U HP ), see Definition 2.5. Shortly after, it was noticed by Nowicki\nand Przytycki that CE is also equivalent to T CE in this setting [14], see Definition 2.7.\nTherefore CE becomes a topological invariant for S-unimodal maps. This is no longer true\nfor S-multimodal maps [14, 22]. \u015awia\u0327tek conjectured that RCE (see Definition 2.10) is\ntopologically invariant for multimodal analytic maps with negative Schwarzian derivative,\nsee Conjecture 1 in [22]. We provide a counterexample to this conjecture, Theorem B.\nA generalization of the Misiurewicz condition, semi-hyperbolicity, was studied in complex polynomial dynamics by Carleson, Jones and Yoccoz [5], see Definition 2.2. They\nshow that semi-hyperbolicity is equivalent to T CE with P = 1 (see Definition 2.7), but\nalso to John regularity of Fatou components. They also prove that such polynomials satisfy the Exponential Shrinking of components condition (ExpShrink), using a telescopic\nconstruction, see Definition 2.4.\nCE rational were initially studied by Przytycki [17, 18]. Later, he showed that T CE\nimplies CE if the Julia set contains only one critical point (unicritical case) [19]. Graczyk\nand Smirnov show that CE implies the backward or second Collet-Eckmann condition\n(CE2(z0 )), which in turn implies the H\u00f6lder regularity of Fatou components [9], see Definition 2.6. The first implication is obtained using a telescopic construction along the\nbackward orbit of z0 . Przytycki and Rohde proved that CE implies T CE [21]. Therefore,\nin the unicritical case they are equivalent and CE is topologically invariant. Recently,\nAspenberg showed that CE rational maps are abundant [1].\nPrzytycki, Rivera-Letelier and Smirnov establish the equivalence of several non-uniform\nhyperbolicity conditions, as T CE, CE2(z0 ), U HP , ExpShrink and the existence of a positive lower bound for the Lyapunov exponent of invariant measures [20]. A semi-hyperbolic\ncounterexample shows that T CE does not imply CE. Another counterexample, involving\nsemi-hyperbolic maps, shows that CE is not a quasi-conformal invariant.\nIn an attempt to characterize T CE in terms of properties of critical orbits, the author\nstudied RCE for rational maps (see Definition 2.3). In [11] it is shown that RCE implies\nT CE. We provide a counterexample to the converse, Theorem A.\n1.2. A short overview. In the following section we present some definitions and basic\nresults and lemmas necessary for our study.\nIn Section 3, we describe a technique of building real polynomials with prescribed topological and analytical properties by specifying their combinatorial properties. The critical\norbits of the polynomials we shall construct will be on the interval [0, 1]. Therefore, we\ncan restrict our attention to the dynamics on the unit interval. We shall make use of the\ntheory of kneading sequences to construct our maps.\n\n\fTWO COUNTEREXAMPLES IN RATIONAL AND INTERVAL DYNAMICS\n\n3\n\nA kneading sequence is a sequence of symbols associated to the points of a critical orbit.\nThe critical points of an interval map define a partition of the interval. To each element of\nthe partition we associate a symbol. The orbit of a critical point will thus generate a symbol\nsequence which describes the itinerary of the point through the various partition elements.\nKnowledge of the kneading sequences is enough to fully describe the combinatorics of a\nmap. Moreover, in the absence of homtervals (Definition 2.14), two maps with the same\nkneading sequences are topologically conjugate.\nWe shall consider one-parameter families of bimodal maps (i.e. with two critical points)\nof the interval, see Definition 2.9. While the theory of multimodal maps and kneading\nsequences is generally well understood [7], for the most part it is related to topological\nproperties of the dynamics. We develop new tools to obtain a prescribed growth (or lack\nthereof) of the derivative on the critical orbits.\nIn Section 4 we prove Theorem A, constructing an ExpShrink polynomial (thus T CE)\nwhich is not RCE. In the vicinity of critical points the diameter of a small domain decreases\nat most in the power rate, while the derivative can approach 0 as fast as one wants (in\ncomparison with the diameter of the domain). This important difference in the behaviour\nof derivative and diameter is the main idea of the (rather technical) proof.\nIn Section 5 we prove Theorem B, a counterexample to the conjecture of \u015awia\u0327tek. Using\ncareful estimates of the derivative on the critical orbits we construct two polynomials with\nnegative Schwarzian derivative with the same combinatorics, thus topologically conjugate\non the interval, such that only one is RCE. This situation is in sharp contrast with the\nunimodal case, where the Collet-Eckmann condition is topologically invariant [15, 14]. An\nimportant feature of our counterexample is that the corresponding critical points of this\ntwo polynomials are of different degree. One should be aware that considered as maps of\nthe complex plane they are not conjugate.\n2. Preliminaries\nLet R be a rational map, J its Julia set and Crit the set of critical points.\nDefinition 2.1. We say that c \u2208 Crit satisfies the Collet-Eckmann condition (c \u2208 CE)\nif |(Rn )0 (R(c))| > C\u03bbn for all n > 0 and some constants C > 0, \u03bb > 1. We say that R is\nCollet-Eckmann if all critical points in J are CE.\nDefinition 2.2. Given c \u2208 Crit we say that it is non-recurrent (c \u2208 N R) if c \u2208\n/ \u03c9(c),\nwhere \u03c9(c) is the \u03c9-limit set, the set of accumulation points of the orbit (Rn (c))n>0 . We\ncall R semi-hyperbolic if all critical points in J are non-recurrent and R has no parabolic\nperiodic orbits.\nRecurrent Collet-Eckmann condition is weaker than Collet-Eckmann or semi-hyperbolicity alone. Indeed, in [9] it is shown that a Collet-Eckmann rational map cannot have\nparabolic cycles.\nDefinition 2.3. We say that R satisfies the Recurrent Collet-Eckmann (RCE) condition\nif every recurrent critical point in the Julia set is Collet-Eckmann and R has no parabolic\nperiodic orbits.\n\n\f4\n\nNICOLAE MIHALACHE\n\nLet us remark that a RCE rational map may have critical points in J that are ColletEckmann and non-recurrent in the same time. Moreover any critical orbit may accumulate\non other critical points.\nSeveral weak hyperbolicity standard conditions are shown to be equivalent in [20].\nAmong these conditions we recall Topological Collet-Eckmann condition (T CE), Uniform\nHyperbolicity on Periodic orbits (U HP ), Exponential Shrinking of components (ExpShrink)\nand Backward Collet-Eckmann condition at some z0 \u2208 C (CE2(z0 )).\nLet us define these conditions.\nDefinition 2.4. R satisfies the Exponential Shrinking of components condition (ExpShrink)\nif there are \u03bb > 1, r > 0 such that for all z \u2208 J, n > 0 and every connected component W\nof R\u2212n (B(z, r))\ndiam W < \u03bb\u2212n .\nHere we use the spherical distance as \u221e may be contained in the Julia set.\nDefinition 2.5. R satisfies Uniform Hyperbolicity on Periodic orbits (U HP ) if there is\n\u03bb > 1 such that for all periodic points z \u2208 J with Rn (z) = z for some n > 0\n|(Rn )0 (z)| > \u03bbn .\nDefinition 2.6. R satisfies the Backward Collet-Eckmann condition at some z0 \u2208 C\n(CE2(z0 )) if there are \u03bb > 1, C > 0 and z0 \u2208 C such that for any preimage z \u2208 C of z0\nwith Rn (z) = z0 for some n > 0\n|(Rn )0 (z)| > C\u03bbn .\nThe definition of T CE is technical but it is stated exclusively in topological terms,\ntherefore it is invariant under topological conjugacy.\nDefinition 2.7. R satisfies the Topological Collet-Eckmann condition (T CE) if there are\nM \u2265 0, P \u2265 1 and r > 0 such that for all z \u2208 J there exists a strictly increasing sequence\nof integers (nj )j\u22651 such that for all j \u2265 1, nj \u2264 P * j and\n\b\n# i : 0 \u2264 i < nj , CompRi (z) R\u2212(nj \u2212i) B(Rnj (x), r) \u2229 Crit 6= \u2205 \u2264 M,\nwhere Compy means the connected component containing y.\nUsing the equivalence of these conditions, we may formulate the main result in [11] as\nfollows.\nTheorem 2.8. The RCE condition implies T CE for rational maps.\nTo produce our counterexamples we restrict to dynamics of real polynomials on the\ninterval with all critical points real. This is a particular case of multimodal dynamics.\nIn the sequel all distances and derivatives are considered with respect to the Euclidean\nmetric if not specified otherwise.\nLet us define multimodal maps and state some classical results about their dynamics.\n\n\fTWO COUNTEREXAMPLES IN RATIONAL AND INTERVAL DYNAMICS\n\n5\n\nDefinition 2.9. Let I be the compact interval [0, 1] and f : I \u2192 I a piecewise strictly\nmonotone continuous map. This means that f has a finite number of turning points 0 <\nc1 < . . . < cl < 1, points where f has a local extremum, and f is strictly monotone on\neach of the l + 1 intervals I1 = [0, c1 ), I2 = (c1 , c2 ), . . . , Il+1 = (cl , 1]. Such a map is called\nl-modal if f (\u2202I) \u2286 \u2202I. If l = 1 then f is called unimodal. If f is C 1+r with r \u2265 0 it is\ncalled a smooth l-modal map if f 0 has no zeros outside {c1 , . . . , cl }.\nIf f is a l-modal map, let us denote by Critf the set of turning points - or critical points\nCritf = {c1 , . . . , cl } .\nLet us define the Recurrent Collet-Eckmann condition (RCE) in the context of multimodal dynamics. Remark that it is similar to Definition 2.3.\nDefinition 2.10. We say that f satisfies RCE if every recurrent critical point c \u2208 Critf ,\nc \u2208 \u03c9(c) is Collet-Eckmann, that is, there exist C > 0, \u03bb > 1 such that for all n \u2265 0\n|(f n )0 (f (c))| > C\u03bbn .\nOur counterexamples are polynomials which have all critical points in I = [0, 1] which\nis included in the Julia set, as they do not have attracting or neutral periodic orbits\nand I is forward invariant. Therefore in this case the previous definition is equivalent\nto Definition 2.3. Analogously, semi-hyperbolicity, U HP , CE2(x) and T CE admit very\nsimilar definitions to the rational case.\nFor all x \u2208 I we denote by O(x) or O+ (x) its forward orbit\nO(x) = (f n (x))n\u22650 .\nAnalogously, let O\u2212 (x) = {y \u2208 f \u2212n (x) : n \u2265 0} and O\u00b1 (x) = {y \u2208 f n (x) : n \u2208 Z}. We\nalso extend these notations to orbits of sets. For S \u2286 I let O+ (S) = {f n (x) : x \u2208 S, n \u2265 0},\nO\u2212 (S) = {y \u2208 f \u2212n (x) : x \u2208 S, n \u2265 0} and O\u00b1 (S) = O+ (S) \u222a O\u2212 (S).\nOne of the most important questions in all areas of dynamics is when two systems\nhave similar underlaying dynamics. A natural equivalence relation for multimodal maps is\ntopological conjugacy.\nDefinition 2.11. We say that two multimodal maps f, g : I \u2192 I are topologically conjugate or simply conjugate if there is a homeomorphism h : I \u2192 I such that\nh \u25e6 f = g \u25e6 h.\nOne may remark that if f and g are conjugate by h then h(f n (x)) = g n (h(x)) for all\nx \u2208 I and n \u2265 0 so h maps orbits of f onto orbits of g. It is easy to check that h is a\nmonotone bijection form the critical set of f to the critical set of g. We may also consider\ncombinatorial properties of orbits and use the order of the points of critical orbits to define\nanother equivalence relation between multimodal maps. Theorem II.3.1 in [7] shows that\nit is enough to consider only the forward orbit of the critical set.\nTheorem 2.12. Let f, g be two l-modal maps with turning points c1 < . . . < cl respectively\nc\u03031 < . . . < c\u0303l . The following properties are equivalent.\n\n\f6\n\nNICOLAE MIHALACHE\n\n(1) There exists an order preserving bijection h from O+ (Critf ) to O+ (Critg ) such that\nh(f (x)) = g(h(x)) for all x \u2208 O+ (Critf ).\n(2) There exists an order preserving bijection h\u0303 from O\u00b1 (Critf ) to O\u00b1 (Critg ) such that\nh\u0303(f (x)) = g(h\u0303(x)) for all x \u2208 O\u00b1 (Critf ).\nIf f and g satisfy the properties of the previous theorem we say that they are combinatorially equivalent. Note that if f and g are conjugate by an order preserving homeomorphism\nh then the restriction of h to O+ (Critf ) is an order preserving bijection onto O+ (Critg )\nso f and g are combinatorially equivalent. The converse is true only in the absence of\nhomtervals. It is the case of all the examples in this chapter. There is a very convenient\nway to describe the combinatorial type of a multimodal map using symbolic dynamics.\nWe associate to every point x \u2208 I a sequence of symbols i(x) that we call the itinerary of\nx. The itineraries k 1 , . . . , k l of the critical values f (c1 ), . . . , f (cl ) are called the kneading\nsequences of f and the ordered set of kneading sequences the kneading invariant. Combinatorially equivalent multimodal maps have the same kneading invariants but the converse\nis true only in the absence of homtervals. We use the kneading invariant to describe the\ndynamics of multimodal maps in one-dimensional families. We build sequences (Fn )n\u22650 of\ncompact families of C 1 multimodal maps with Fn+1 \u2286 Fn for all n \u2265 0 and obtain our\nexamples as the intersection of such sequences.\nWhen not specified otherwise, we assume f to be a multimodal map.\nDefinition 2.13. Let O(p) be a periodic orbit of f . This orbit is called attracting if its\nbasin\n\b\nB(p) = x \u2208 I : f k (x) \u2192 O(p) as k \u2192 \u221e\ncontains an open set. The immediate basin B0 (p) of O(p) is the union of connected components of B(p) which contain points from O(p). If B0 (p) is a neighborhood of O(p) then\nthis orbit is called a two-sided attractor and otherwise a one-sided attractor. Suppose f\nis C 1 and let m(p) = |(f n )0 (p)| where n is the period of p. If m(p) < 1 we say that O(p) is\nattracting respectively super-attracting if m(p) = 0. We call O(p) neutral if m(p) = 1 and\nwe say it is repelling if m(p) > 1.\nLet us denote by B(f ) the union of the basins of periodic attracting orbits and by B0 (f )\nthe union of immediate basins of periodic attractors. The basins of attracting periodic\ncontain intervals on which all iterates of f are monotone. Such intervals do not intersect\nO\u2212 (Critf ) and they do not carry too much combinatorial information.\nDefinition 2.14. Let us define a homterval to be an interval on which f n is monotone for\nall n \u2265 0.\nHomtervals are related to wandering intervals and they play an important role in the\nstudy of the relation between conjugacy and combinatorial equivalence.\nDefinition 2.15. An interval J \u2286 I is wandering if all its iterates J, f (J), f 2 (J), . . . are\ndisjoint and if (f n (J))n\u22650 does not tend to a periodic orbit.\n\n\fTWO COUNTEREXAMPLES IN RATIONAL AND INTERVAL DYNAMICS\n\n7\n\nHomtervals have simple dynamics described by the following lemma, Lemma II.3.1 in\n[7].\nLemma 2.16. Let J be a homterval of f . Then there are two possibilities:\n(1) J is a wandering interval;\n(2) J \u2286 B(f ) and some iterate of J is mapped into an interval L such that f p maps L\nmonotonically into itself for some p \u2265 0.\nMultimodal maps satisfying some regularity conditions have no wandering intervals. Let\nus say that f is non-flat at a critical point c if there exists a C 2 diffeomorphism \u03c6 : R \u2192 I\nwith \u03c6(0) = c such that f \u25e6 \u03c6 is a polynomial near the origin.\nThe following theorem is Theorem II.6.2 in [7].\nTheorem 2.17. Let f be a C 2 map that is non-flat at each critical point. Then f has no\nwandering intervals.\nGuckenheimer proved this theorem in 1979 for unimodal maps with negative Schwarzian\nderivative with non-degenerate critical point, that is with |f 00 (c)| 6= 0. The Schwarzian\nderivative was first used by Singer to study the dynamics of quadratic unimodal maps\nx \u2192 ax(1 \u2212 x) with a \u2208 [0, 4]. He observed that this property is preserved under iteration\nand that is has important consequences in unimodal and multimodal dynamics.\nDefinition 2.18. Let f : I \u2192 I be a C 3 l-modal map. The Schwarzian derivative of f at\nx is defined as\n\u0012\n\u00132\nf 000 (x) 3 f 00 (x)\nSf (x) = 0\n\u2212\n,\nf (x)\n2 f (x)\nfor all x \u2208 I \\ {c1 , . . . , cl }.\nWe may compute the Schwarzian derivate of a composition\n(1)\n\nS(g \u25e6 f )(x) = Sg(f (x)) * |f 0 (x)|2 + Sf (x),\n\ntherefore if Sf < 0 and Sg < 0 then S(f \u25e6 g) < 0 so negative Schwarzian derivative is\npreserved under iteration. Let us state an important consequence of this property for C 3\nmaps of the interval proved by Singer (see Theorem II.6.1 in [7]).\nTheorem 2.19 (Singer). If f : I \u2192 I is a C 3 map with negative Schwarzian derivative\nthen\n(1) the immediate basin of any attracting periodic orbit contains either a critical point\nof f or a boundary point of the interval I;\n(2) each neutral periodic point is attracting;\n(3) there are no intervals of periodic points.\nCombining this result with Theorem 2.17 and Lemma 2.16 we obtain the following\nCorollary 2.20. If f is C 3 multimodal map with negative Schwarzian derivative that is\nnon-flat at each critical point and which has no attracting periodic orbits then it has no\nhomterval. Therefore O\u2212 (Critf ) is dense in I.\n\n\f8\n\nNICOLAE MIHALACHE\n\nThe following corollary is a particular case of the corollary of Theorem II.3.1 in [7].\nCorollary 2.21. Let f, g and h be as in Theorem 2.12. If f and g have no homtervals\nthen they are topologically conjugate.\nAll our examples of multimodal maps in this chapter are polynomials with negative\nSchwarzian derivative and without attracting periodic orbits. We prefer however to use\nslightly more general classes of multimodal maps, as suggested by the previous two corollaries. As combinatorially equivalent multimodal maps have the same monotonicity type\nwe only use maps that are increasing on the leftmost lap I1 , that is exactly the multimodal\nmaps f with f (0) = 0. Let us define some classes of multimodal maps\n\b\nSl = f : I \u2192 I : f is a C 1 l-modal map with f (0) = 0 ,\n\b\nSl0 = f \u2208 Sl : f is C 3 and Sf < 0 ,\nPl = {f \u2208 Sl0 : f non-flat at each critical point} and\nPl0 = {f \u2208 Pl : all periodic points of f are repelling} .\nWe have seen that in the absence of homtervals combinatorially equivalent multimodal\nmaps are topologically conjugate. Using symbolic dynamics is a more convenient way to\ndescribe the combinatorial properties of forward critical orbits. Let AI = {I1 , . . . , Il+1 }\nand Ac = {c1 , . . . , cl } be two alphabets and A = AI \u222a Ac . Let\n[\n\u03a3 = ANI \u222a\n(AnI \u00d7 Ac )\nn\u22650\n\nbe the space of sequences of symbols of A with the following property. If i \u2208 \u03a3 and\nm = |i| \u2208 N is its length then m = \u221e if and only if i consists only of symbols of AI .\nMoreover, if m < \u221e then i contains exactly one symbol of Ac on the rightmost position.\nLet \u03a30 = \u03a3 \\ Ac be the space of sequences i \u2208 \u03a3 with |i| > 1. Let us define the shift\ntransformation \u03c3 : \u03a30 \u2192 \u03a3 by\n\u03c3(i0 i1 . . .) = i1 i2 . . . .\nIf f \u2208 Sl let i : I \u2192 \u03a3 be defined by i(x) = i0 (x)i1 (x) . . . where in (x) = Ik if f n (x) \u2208 Ik\nand in (x) = ck if f n (x) = ck for all n \u2265 0. The map i relates the dynamics of f on\nI \\ {c1 , . . . , cl } with the shift transformation \u03c3 on \u03a30\ni(f (x)) = \u03c3(i(x)) for all x \u2208 I \\ {c1 , . . . , cl } .\nMoreover, we may define a signed lexicographic ordering on \u03a3 that makes i increasing. It\nbecomes strictly increasing in the absence of homtervals.\nDefinition 2.22. A signed lexicographic ordering \u227a on \u03a3 is defined as follows. Let us\ndefine a sign \u000f : A \u2192 {\u22121, 0, 1} where \u000f(Ij ) = (\u22121)j+1 for all j = 1, . . . , l + 1 and \u000f(cj ) = 0\nfor all j = 1, . . . , l. Using the natural ordering on A we say that x \u227a y if there exists n \u2265 0\nsuch that xi = yi for all i = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1 and\nxn *\n\nn\u22121\nY\ni=0\n\n\u000f(xi ) < yn *\n\nn\u22121\nY\ni=0\n\n\u000f(yi ).\n\n\fTWO COUNTEREXAMPLES IN RATIONAL AND INTERVAL DYNAMICS\n\n9\n\nLet us observe that \u227a is a complete ordering and that\n\u000f * f 0 > 0 on I \\ {c1 , . . . , cl }, that\nQn\u22121\nis \u000f represents the monotonicity of f . The product i=0 \u000f(xi ) represents therefore the\nmonotonicity of f n . This is the main reason for the monotonicity of i with respect to \u227a.\nProposition 2.23. Let f \u2208 Sl for some l \u2265 0.\n(1) If x < y then i(x) \u0016 i(y).\n(2) If i(x) \u227a i(y) then x < y.\n(3) If f \u2208 Pl0 then x < y if and only if i(x) \u227a i(y).\nProof. The first two points are Lemma II.3.1 in [7]. If f \u2208 Pl0 then by Corollary 2.20\nO\u2212 (Critf ) is dense in I. Let us note that\nO\u2212 (Critf ) = {x \u2208 I : |i(x)| < \u221e} .\nMoreover, O\u2212 (Critf ) is countable as f \u22121 (x) is finite for all x \u2208 I, therefore i is strictly\nincreasing.\n\u0003\nLet us define the kneading sequences of f \u2208 Sl by k i = i(f (ci )) for i = 1, . . . , l, the\nitineraries of the critical values. The kneading invariant of f is K(f ) = (k 1 , . . . , k l ). The\nlast point of the previous lemma shows that if f, g \u2208 Pl0 and K(f ) = K(g) then there is an\norder preserving bijection h : O+ (Critf ) \u2192 O+ (Critg ). Therefore, by Corollaries 2.20 and\n2.21, f and g are topologically conjugate.\nLet us define one-dimensional smooth families of multimodal maps. They are the central\nobject of this paper.\nDefinition 2.24. We say that F : [\u03b1, \u03b2] \u2192 Sl is a family of l-modal maps if F is\ncontinuous with respect to the C 1 topology of Sl .\nNote that we do not assume the continuity of critical points in such a family - as in the\ngeneral definition of a family of multimodal maps in [7] - as it is a direct consequence of\nthe smoothness conditions we impose.\nWhen not stated otherwise we suppose F : [\u03b1, \u03b2] \u2192 Sl is a family of l-modal maps and\ndenote f\u03b3 = F(\u03b3).\nLemma 2.25. The critical points ci : [\u03b1, \u03b2] \u2192 I of f\u03b3 are continuous maps for all i =\n1, . . . , l.\nProof. Fix \u03b30 \u2208 [\u03b1, \u03b2] and\n1\nmin |ci (\u03b30 ) \u2212 cj (\u03b30 )|.\n2 i6=j\nLet A = {x \u2208 [0, 1] : \u03b5 \u2264 mini |x \u2212 ci (\u03b30 )|}, a finite union of compact intervals and\n0<\u03b5<\n\n\u03b8 = min |f\u03b30 0 (x)| > 0\nx\u2208A\n\nby Definition 2.9.

First let us remark that the condition \u000f(S 0 ) = 1 guarantees that\ni1 \u227a SI2\u221e \u227a i2 .\nUsing for example convergences (10) and the bijective map i(g\u03b1 ) defined by (7) there exists\nN0 > 0 such that for all k \u2265 N0 , k(\u03b10 ) \u227a i1 \u227a i2 \u227a k(\u03b20 ). Moreover, if k \u2265 n then i1 and\ni2 are minimal, using Lemma 3.6.\nTherefore for k \u2265 max(N0 , n) we may apply Proposition 3.5 to show that there exist\n\u03b31 \u2208 k \u22121 (i1 ) \u2229 (\u03b10 , \u03b20 ) and \u03b32 \u2208 k \u22121 (i2 ) \u2229 (\u03b31 , \u03b20 ). As i1 and i2 are finite and the family G\nis natural, k \u22121 (i1 ) and k \u22121 (i2 ) are finite.\nWe may apply again Proposition 3.5 to see that \u03b31 is increasing to a limit \u03b3 \u2212 as k\u2192\u221e.\nAgain by Proposition 3.5 and by the finiteness of k \u22121 (SI2\u221e ) there exists\n\u0001\n\u03b3\u221e = max k \u22121 (SI2\u221e ) \u2229 (\u03b10 , \u03b20 ) < \u03b20 and \u03b3 \u2212 \u2264 \u03b3\u221e .\nFor the same reasons there is N > 0 such that \u03b32 > \u03b3\u221e for all k \u2265 N , therefore \u03b32 becomes\ndecreasing and converges to some \u03b3 + \u2265 \u03b3\u221e .\nSuppose that the statement does not hold, that is\n\u03b3 \u2212 < \u03b3 +.\nThe map i(g\u03b1 ) : I \u2192 \u03a30 is bijective and order preserving and pi \u2192r, qi \u2192r as i\u2192\u221e therefore\n{i \u2208 \u03a30 : i1 \u0016 i \u0016 i2 for all k > 0} = {SI2\u221e }.\nThen the definitions of \u03b3 \u2212 and \u03b3 + imply that\nk(\u03b3) = SI2\u221e for all \u03b3 \u2208 [\u03b3 \u2212 , \u03b3 + ],\nwhich contradicts the hypothesis.\n\n\u0003\n\nFrom the previous proof we may also retain the following Corollary.\nCorollary 3.8. Assume the hypothesis of the previous proposition. Then\nlim \u03b31 = lim \u03b32 = \u03b3\u221e\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nand k(\u03b3\u221e ) =\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nSI2\u221e .\n\nWe may also control the growth of the derivative on the second critical orbit in the\nsetting of the last proposition. In fact, letting k\u2192\u221e, the second critical orbit spends most\nof its time very close to the fixed repelling point r. Therefore the growth of the derivative\nalong this orbit is exponential.\nLet us also compute some bounds for the derivative along two types of orbits.\nLemma 3.9.

Therefore the continuity of (\u03b3, x)\u2192 g\u03b3j (x) for all j = 1, . . . , n implies the\nexistence of \u03b8.\n\u0003\nThe previous lemma helps us estimate the derivative of g\u03b3n (x) on a compact interval of\nparameters if i(x) \u2208 Ijn \u00d7 \u03a3 and n is sufficiently large.

As S(P\u03b3 ) = S(Q\u03b3 ) = 0 for all \u03b3 \u2208 [0, h], using equality\n(1), one may check that\nS(g\u03b3 ) < 0 on I \\ {c1 (\u03b3), c2 (\u03b3)} for all \u03b3 \u2208 [0, h].\nIf we write\n(14)\n\ng\u03b3 (x) =\n\n3\nX\n\nak (\u03b3)xk\n\nk=0\n\nit is not hard to check that \u03b3 \u2192 ak (\u03b3) is continuous on [0, h] for k = 0, . . . , 3 therefore\n\u03b3 \u2192 g\u03b3 is continuous with respect to the C 1 topology on I. By the definition of P2 (see\npage 8), as g\u03b3 (0) = 0 for all \u03b3 \u2208 [0, h], G : [0, h] \u2192 P2 with G(\u03b3) = g\u03b3 for all \u03b3 \u2208 [0, h] is\na family of bimodal maps with negative Schwarzian derivative.

Moreover, g\u03b3 (c1 ) = 1 for all \u03b3 \u2208 [0, h] thus G satisfies also (4).\nObserve that if \u03b3 \u2208 [0, h] then Q\u03b3 (\u22122) = 0 if and only if \u03b3 = 0, therefore condition (5) is\nalso satisfied by G.

Its first critical point is non-recurrent as g\u03b3 (c1 ) = 1\nand 1 is fixed for all \u03b3 \u2208 [\u03b10 , \u03b20 ]. Therefore the second critical point c2 should be recurrent\nand not Collet-Eckmann. We let c2 accumulate on c1 also to control the growth of the\nderivative along its orbit. We build g\u03b3 such that its second critical orbit spends most of\nthe time near r or 1 so its derivative accumulates sufficient expansion. We show that g\u03b3 is\nExpShrink (thus T CE) using a telescopic construction, in an analogous way to the proof\nof Theorem 2.8.\n4.1. A construction.

Therefore the backward orbit of c1 in I1\nconverges to 0 and by compactness the convergence is uniform.

If g\u03b3 \u2208 G0 and its second critical orbit (vn )n\u22650 accumulates on a repelling\nperiodic orbit then g\u03b3 satisfies the hypothesis of Lemma 4.4. Moreover, if (vn )n\u22650 is preperiodic then g\u03b3 has ExpShrink.\nProof. By Theorems III.2.2 and III.2.3 in [4], the immediate basin of attraction of an\nattracting or parabolic periodic point contains a critical point. But c1 is strictly preperiodic\nand (vn )n\u22650 accumulates on a repelling periodic orbit thus it cannot converge to some\nattracting or parabolic periodic point. Using Theorem V.1.1 in [4] we rule out Siegel disks\nand Herman rings as their boundary should be contained in the closure of the critical\norbits which is contained in [0, 1] for all g\u03b3 \u2208 G0 . Using Sullivan's classification of Fatou\ncomponents, Theorem IV.2.1 in [4], the Fatou set equals the basin of attraction of infinity\nwhich is connected for all polynomials by the maximum principle.\nIf (vn )n\u22650 is preperiodic then g\u03b3 is semi-hyperbolic therefore by the main result in [5] or\nby Theorem 2.8 it has ExpShrink.\n\u0003\nLet us recall some general distortion properties of rational maps. The following result is\na classical distortion estimate due to Koebe, see for example Lemma 2.5 in [8].\n\n\fTWO COUNTEREXAMPLES IN RATIONAL AND INTERVAL DYNAMICS\n\n31\n\nLemma 4.8 (Koebe). Let g : B \u2192 C be a univalent map from the\u0001 unit disk into the\ncomplex plane. Then the image g(B) contains the ball B g(0), 14 |g 0 (0)| . Moreover, for all\nz \u2208 B we have that\n(1 \u2212 |z|)\n|g 0 (z)|\n(1 + |z|)\n\u2264\n\u2264\n,\n3\n|g 0 (0)|\n(1 + |z|)\n(1 \u2212 |z|)3\nand\n|z|(1 + |z|)\n.\n|g(z) \u2212 g(0)| \u2264 |g 0 (z)|\n1 \u2212 |z|\nFor the remainder of this section, let f be any rational map and Crit the set of critical\npoints of f .\nDistortion.: This is a reformulation of the previous lemma. For all D > 1 there\nexists \u03b5 > 0 such that if the open W satisfies\n(30)\n\ndiam W \u2264 \u03b5 dist (W, Crit) ,\nthen the distortion of f in W is bounded by D.\nPullback.: Once a sufficiently small r > 0 is fixed, there exists M \u2265 1 such that for\nany open U with diam U \u2264 r and for all W \u2208 Comp f \u22121 (U ) and all z \u2208 W\n\n(31)\n\ndiam W \u2264 M |f 0 (z)|\u22121 diam U.\nWe shall use this estimate for W close to Crit.\n\n4.3. A counterexample. Using Propositions 4.1 and 4.2 we build a sequence of families\n(Gn )n\u22651 which converge to a bimodal polynomial g that has ExpShrink. Its first critical\npoint c1 is non-recurrent as g(c1 ) = 1 and 1 is a repelling fixed point. The second critical\npoint c2 is recurrent and it does not satisfy the Collet-Eckmann condition. Therefore g\ndoes not satisfy RCE.\nWe obtain the following theorem which states that the converse of Theorem 2.8 does not\nhold. We use the equivalence of T CE and ExpShrink [20].\nTheorem A. There exists an ExpShrink polynomial that is not RCE.\nThe proof that g has ExpShrink is analogous to that of Theorem 2.8. This paper\ncontains a complete proof of Theorem A. However, remarks about the proof of Theorem\n2.8 are present for the convenience of the reader. As g is not RCE we have to modify some\nof the tools like Propositions 9, 10 and 11 in [11]. The polynomial g0 is Collet-Eckmann\nand semi-hyperbolic thus RCE. By the main result of [5] or by Theorem 2.8, g0 has\nExpShrink. Choosing the family G1 in a sufficiently small neighborhood of g0 we show\ntwo contraction results similar to Propositions 9 and 10 in [11] that hold on G1 , Corollary\n4.9 and Proposition 4.13 below. As g \u2208 G1 we may choose constants \u03bc, \u03b8, \u03b5, R and N0 - as\ndescribed in the sequel - that do not depend on g.\nThe main idea of the proof of Theorem A is that in inequality (31) the right term may\nbe much larger than the left term, see also Lemma 4.12. This means that when pulling\nback a ball B to B \u22121 near a degree two critical point, the diameter of B \u22121 is comparable\n\n\f32\n\nNICOLAE MIHALACHE\n\nto the square root of the radius of B but |f 0 (z)|\u22121 may be as large as one wants for some\nz \u2208 B \u22121 . This is the main difference between growth conditions in terms of the derivative\nor in terms of the diameter of pullbacks.\nCorollary 4.10, an immediate consequence of Corollary 4.6, replaces Proposition 11 in\n[11] in the proof of Theorem A.\nCorollary 4.9. There exists \u03b4 > 0 such that for all 0 < r < R \u2264 \u03b4 there exist \u03b2 > \u03b10 and\nN > 0 such that for all \u03b3 \u2208 [\u03b10 , \u03b2] and z \u2208 J the Julia set of g\u03b3\ndiam Comp g\u03b3\u2212N (B(z, R)) < r.\nProof. Using Lemma 4.7, g0 satisfies the hypothesis of Proposition 4.5. Using the continuity\nof coefficients of g\u03b3 (14) there exists \u03b2 > \u03b10 such that\n|g0 \u2212 g\u03b3 | < d for all \u03b3 \u2208 [\u03b10 , \u03b2].\n\u0003\nThe following consequence of Corollary 4.6 is a weaker version of uniform Backward\nStability. The proof is analogous to the proof of the previous proposition.\nCorollary 4.10.

Using Lemma 3.10,\ninequalities (15) and Lemma 3.9 for i1 = I3 c1 , i2 = I3 c2 if I\u2217 = I2 and i1 = I3 c2 , i2 = I3\u221e if\nI\u2217 = I3 there exists N0 > 0 that does not depend on \u03b3 such that if N \u2265 N0 then\n\u00010\nk\ng\u03b3k (x) > (\u03bb0 ) .\n0\u0001\nLet D \u2208 1, \u03bb\u03bb and \u03b5 > 0 given by inequality (30). Using Lemma 4.11 it is enough to\nshow that B(xi , 2\u03b4) satisfies inequality (30) for all i = 0, . . . , k \u2212 1.\nLet us recall that g\u03b3 (y) < y for all y \u2208 (c2 , 1) = I3 \\{1}. Therefore for all i = 0, . . . , k \u2212 1\ndist (xi , {c1 , c2 }) \u2265 dist (xk\u22121 , {c1 , c2 }) > dist (x(I3 c1 ), {c1 , c2 }) .\nLet\nd = min dist (x(I3 c1 ), {c1 , c2 })\n\u03b3\u2208[\u03b10 ,\u03b21 ]\n\nand recall that \u03b5 does not depend on \u03b3. Therefore there exists\n\u03b4=\n\nd\n>0\n2(1 + 2\u03b5\u22121 )\n\nsuch that if dist (y, {c1 , c2 }) \u2265 d then B(y, 2\u03b4) satisfies inequality (30).\nThe following corollary admits a very similar proof.\n\n\u0003\n\n\f36\n\nNICOLAE MIHALACHE\n\nCorollary 4.16.

We set\n(39)\n\n\u03b5 = min (\u03b50 , \u03b4 0 , \u03b4 00 , rM ) .\n\nCorollary 4.10 provides \u03b210 > \u03b10 and \u03b42 > 0 such that for all \u03b3 \u2208 [\u03b10 , \u03b210 ] the diameter\nof any pullback of a ball of radius at most \u03b42 centered on J\u03b3 is smaller than \u03b5.

We define\n\u03b2 = min(\u03b220 , \u03b230 ).\n\n\fTWO COUNTEREXAMPLES IN RATIONAL AND INTERVAL DYNAMICS\n\n37\n\nLet f be a rational map and Crit its critical set.

For all \u03b3 \u2208 [\u03b10 , \u03b2], z \u2208 J\u03b3 , 0 < r \u2264 R and (Wk )k\u22650 a backward orbit of\n6 \u2205\nB (z, r) = W0 , if degWk g\u03b3k > \u03bc then there exist 0 < k1 < k2 \u2264 n such that Wk1 \u2229{c1 , c2 } =\nand c2 \u2208 Wk2 .\nProof. By the definition of R, diam Wk < \u03b5 \u2264 \u03b50 < |c1 \u2212 c2 | therefore Wk contains at most\none critical point for all k \u2265 0. As \u03bc = \u03bcc1 = \u03bcc2 there exist 0 < k1 < k2 \u2264 n such that\nWk1 and Wk2 contain exactly one critical point each. Suppose c1 \u2208 Wk2 therefore 1 \u2208 Wk\nfor all 0 \u2264 k < k2 which contradicts diam Wk1 < \u03b5 \u2264 \u03b50 .\n\u0003\nLet us prove the main result of this section.\nProof of Theorem A. This proof has two parts. The first part describes the construction of\na convergent sequence of families (Gn )n\u22650 of bimodal polynomials with negative Schwarzian\nderivative. Its limit g does not satisfy RCE. The second part shows that g has ExpShrink\nand it is similar to the proof of Theorem 2.8.\nLet us recall the construction of the family G1 . It is described by the common prefix\nS1 of its kneading\nsequences k(\u03b3) for all \u03b3 \u2208 [\u03b11 , \u03b21 ]. We defined S1 = I1k0 +1 I2k1 so \u03b21 <\n\u0001\nk \u22121 I1k0 c1 which converges to \u03b10 = 0 as k0 \u2192\u221e. Using this convergence, inequalities (15),\nLemma 3.10 applied to v = g\u03b3 (c2 ) and Lemma 3.9 applied to i1 = I1 c1 , i2 = I1 c2 to bound\ng\u03b30 (vk0 ) there exists k0 > 0 such that the following inequalities hold\n\u0001\n\u03b21 < max k \u22121 I1k0 c1 < \u03b2,\nd\u03b3 (k) > \u03bbk for all \u03b3 \u2208 [\u03b10 , \u03b21 ] and k = 1, . . . , k0 + 1.\nAgain by Lemma 3.10, property (17) and inequalities (15), if k1 is sufficiently large then\n(40)\n\nd\u03b3 (k) > \u03bbk for all \u03b3 \u2208 [\u03b11 , \u03b21 ] and k = 1, . . . , t1 ,\n\nwhere t1 = k0 + 1 + k1 = |S1 |. Let us choose k1 such that the previous inequality holds\nand such that t1 > N1 and\n\u0001\n(41)\nmax \u03b5R\u22121 , 2M4 (\u03b8R)\u22121 , \u03b52 (\u03b8R)\u22122 , 2M1 < \u03bbt1 \u22121 ,\nwhere M1 and M4 are defined by inequalities (32) respectively (33). This achieves the\nconstruction of the family G1 .\nFor all k \u2265 1 we construct G2k using Proposition 4.1 with\n\u03bb\u22121 < \u03bb1 < \u03bb2 < 1,\n\n\f38\n\nNICOLAE MIHALACHE\n\nand G2k+1 using Proposition 4.2 with\n\u2206k = 2\u2212k .\nUsing inequality (19) the sequence (Gn )n\u22651 converges to a map g = g\u03b3 . Let us denote\nd(n) = dn (\u03b3) = (g n )0 (v) and d(n, p) = dn,p (\u03b3) = (g p )0 (vn ) for all n, p \u2265 0, where v\nis the second critical value and vn = g n (v). For all n \u2265 2 let pn = p be provided by\nProposition 4.1 or Proposition 4.2 used to construct Gn . Therefore for all n \u2265 1\ntn < pn+1 < tn+1 ,\nwhere tn = |Sn | the length of the common prefix Sn of kneading sequences in Gn . As\n\u03b3 \u2208 [\u03b1n , \u03b2n ] for all n \u2265 1,\nk = k(\u03b3) \u2208 Sn \u00d7 \u03a3 for all n \u2265 1.\nLet us also recall that for all k \u2265 1\nS2k = S2k\u22121 I2k1 +1 I3k2 I2k3 ,\nand that we may choose k1 , k2 and k3 as large as we need. We impose therefore for all\nk\u22651\n(42)\n\nk1 > N3 , k2 > N2 and k3 > N3 .\n\nLet us remark that g(c1 ) = 1, g(1) = 1 and |g 0 (1)| > 1 therefore c1 \u2208 J the Julia set\nof g and c1 is non-recurrent and Collet-Eckmann. Let us remark that \u2206k \u21920 as k\u2192\u221e\nand \u03b3 \u2208 [\u03b12k+1 , \u03b22k+1 ] for all k \u2265 1 therefore the second critical orbit is recurrent. By\nconstruction and inequality (12) the second critical orbit accumulates on r and on 1.\nTherefore c2 \u2208 J using for example a similar argument to the proof of Lemma 4.7. Let us\nshow that c2 is not Collet-Eckmann. Indeed, by Proposition 4.1 for all k \u2265 1\nd(p2k ) < \u03bbp22k < 1,\nand p2k \u2192\u221e as k\u2192\u221e. Therefore by Definition 2.3\ng is not RCE.\nCombining inequalities (40) and (16), the third claim of Proposition 4.1 and the second\nclaim of Proposition 4.2\n[\n(43)\nd(n) > \u03bbn for all n \u2208\n{t2k , . . . , p2k+2 \u2212 1} .\nk\u22650\n\nLet us check that for all m > 0 such that |g m (c2 ) \u2212 c2 | < \u03b5\n(44)\n\nd(m) > \u03bbm .\n\nLet us recall that \u03b5 \u2264 \u03b50 by its definition (39) so |g m (c2 ) \u2212 c2 | < \u03b5 implies that vm =\ng m+1 (c2 ) \u2208 I1 therefore k(m) = I1 so there exists k \u2265 1 such that\nt2k < m < t2k+1 ,\n\n\fTWO COUNTEREXAMPLES IN RATIONAL AND INTERVAL DYNAMICS\n\n39\n\nas Proposition 4.1 extends S2n\u22121 to S2n using only the symbols I2 and I3 for all n \u2265 1.\nTherefore m \u2208 {t2k , . . . , p2k+2 \u2212 1} thus inequality (44) is a direct consequence of inequality\n(43).\nLet us show that g has ExpShrink. We use a telescope that is very similar to the one\nused in the proof of Theorem 2.8. Loosely speaking, the strategy is the following. We\nconsider pullbacks of a small ball centered on the Julia set J of g. We show that after\nsome time, the pullbacks are contracted. We include such a component in another ball\ncentered on J. The construction is achieved inductively and contractions at each step are\nused to show uniform contraction, thus ExpShrink. We call blocks of the telescope the\nsequences of pullbacks associated to each step. In order to deal with various configurations\nof critical points inside the telescope, we need three types of blocks.\nLet us introduce additional notation and rigorously define the telescope.\nFor B \u2286 C connected and n \u2265 0, we write B \u2212n or g \u2212n (B) for some connected component\nof g \u2212n (B). When z \u2208 B and some backward orbit zn \u2208 g \u2212n (z) are fixed, B \u2212n is the\nconnected component of g \u2212n (B) that contains zn .\nWe consider a pullback of an arbitrary ball B (z, R) with z \u2208 J, of length N > 0. We\nshow that there are constants C1 > 0 and \u03bb3 > 1 that do not depend on z nor on N such\nthat\ndiam B (z, R)\u2212N \u2264 C1 \u03bb\u2212n\n3 .\nIt is easy to check that the previous inequality for all z \u2208 J and N > 0 implies the\nExpShrink condition.\nLet (zn )n\u22650 \u2286J be a backward orbit of z, that is z0 = z and g(zn+1 ) = zn for all\nn \u2265 0. We consider preimages of B(z, R00 ) := B(z, R) up to time N . We show that\n0\nthere is some moment N00 when the pullback B(z, R00 )\u2212N0 observes a strong contraction.\n0\nThen B(z, R00 )\u2212N0 can be nested inside some ball B(zN00 , R10 ) where R10 \u2264 R. This new\nball is pulled back and the construction is achieved inductively. The pullbacks B(z, R00 ),\n0\nB(z, R00 )\u22121 . . . B(z, R00 )\u2212N0 form the first block of the telescope. The pullbacks B(zN00 , R10 ),\n0\nB(zN00 , R10 )\u22121 . . . B(zN00 , R10 )\u2212N1 form the second block and so on. Lemma 4.17 is essential to\nmanage the passage between two such consecutive telescope blocks. We show contraction\nfor every block using either Corollary 4.10 or Proposition 4.13. This leads to a classification\nof blocks depending on the presence and on the type of critical points inside them.\nLet R0 be the radius of the initial ball of some block and N 0 be its length. We introduce\na new parameter r0 < R for each block, a lower bound for R0 . It is an upper bound\nof the diameter of the last pullback of the previous block. This choice guarantees that\nconsecutive blocks are nested. A block that starts at time n is defined by the choice of\nR0 with r0 \u2264 R0 \u2264 R and of N 0 with 1 \u2264 N 0 \u2264 N \u2212 n. It is the pullback of length N 0 of\nB(zn , R0 ).\nFor all n, t \u2265 0 and r > 0 we denote\nd(n, r, t) = degB(zn ,r)\u2212t (g t ) and\nd(n, r, t) = degB(zn ,r)\u2212t (g t ) .\n\n\f40\n\nNICOLAE MIHALACHE\n\nFix n \u2265 0 and t \u2265 1 and consider the maps d and d defined on [r0 , R]. They are increasing\nand d \u2264 d. Moreover, for all n \u2265 0, r > 0, t \u2265 0 and s > 0,\nd(n, r, t) \u2264 d(n, r + s, t).\nThe set r \u2208 [r0 , R] | d(n, r, t) < d(n, r, t) is the common set of discontinuities of d and d.\nNote also that d is lower semi-continuous and d is upper semi-continuous.\nFor transparency, we also denote\n\b\n\nWk = B(zn , R0 )\u2212k .\nLet us define the three types of blocks. For convenience, we keep the same notations as\nin the proof of Theorem 2.8 in [11].\nType 1: Blocks with R0 = r0 and N 0 such that d(n, R0 , N 0 ) > 1 and c2 \u2208 WN 0 +1 .\nType 2: Blocks with R0 = R, N 0 = min(N0 , N \u2212 n) and d(n, R, N \u2212 n) \u2264 \u03bc.\nType 3: Blocks with d(n, R0 , N 0 ) > 1, c2 \u2208 WN 0 +1 and d(n, R0 , N \u2212 n) \u2264 \u03bc.\nLet us define r0 . It is the diameter of the last pullback of the previous block of type 1\nor 3. It is r = \u03b8R if the previous block is of type 2 and r0 = R for the first block.\nLet us first show that for all z \u2208 J and N > 0 we may define a telescope using the three\ntypes of blocks. The construction is inductive and we show that given 0 \u2264 n < N and\n0 < r0 \u2264 R we can find R0 \u2208 [r0 , R] and 0 < N 0 \u2264 N \u2212 n that define a block of one of the\nthree types. We also show contraction along every block so r0 defined as above is smaller\nthan R, thus completing the proof of the existence of the telescope.\nIf d(n, r0 , N \u2212 n + 1) > \u03bc = 2 then by Corollary 4.18 there is 1 \u2264 N 0 \u2264 N \u2212 n that\ndefines a type 1 pullback for R0 = r0 . If d(n, R, N \u2212 n) \u2264 \u03bc then we define a type 2\nblock, as d \u2264 d. Note that the first block of the telescope is already constructed as\nr0 = R. In all other cases r0 < R. If d(n, R, N \u2212 n + 1) > \u03bc there is a smallest R0 , with\nr0 < R0 \u2264 R, such that d(n, R0 , N \u2212 n + 1) > \u03bc. Thus R0 is a point of discontinuity of d so\nd(n, R0 , N \u2212n+1) < d(n, R0 , N \u2212n+1), therefore d(n, R0 , N \u2212n) \u2264 d(n, R0 , N \u2212n+1) \u2264 \u03bc.\nThen by Corollary 4.18 there is 1 \u2264 N 0 \u2264 N \u2212 n that defines a type 3 pullback.\nLet us be more precise with our notations. We denote by n0i , Ni0 , ri0 and Ri0 the parameters\nn, N 0 , r0 and R0 of the i-th block. Let also Wi,k be Wk in the context of the i-th block with\ni \u2208 {0, . . . , b}, where b + 1 is the number of blocks of the telescope. So n00 = 0, r00 = R and\nn01 = N00 .

The type 20 is a particular\ncase of the second type, when N 0 < N0 . This could only happen for the last block, when\nN \u2212 n0b < N0 . So Ti \u2208 {1, 2, 3} for all 0 \u2264 i < b.

Let h be the limit of (Hn )n\u22651 and h\u0303 be the limit of (H\u0303n )n\u22651 .\nThen h is CE therefore RCE and the second critical point c\u03032 of h\u0303 is recurrent but not\nCE therefore h\u0303 is not RCE. Both h and h\u0303 have negative Schwarzian derivative and their\nsecond critical orbits accumulate on r and 1 respectively on r\u0303 and 1. Moreover, using\nLemma 4.7, h and h\u0303 do not have attracting or neutral periodic points on [0, 1]. We may\ntherefore apply Corollaries 2.20 and 2.21 to obtain the following theorem that contradicts\nConjecture 1 in [22].\nTheorem B. The RCE condition for S-multimodal maps is not topologically invariant.\nAcknowledgments. The author would like to thank Jacek Graczyk who ask the question wether RCE is equivalent to T CE. He also suggested that the construction developed\nfor the proof of Theorem A could also be employed to prove Theorem B.
