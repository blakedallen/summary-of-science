Even for Earth, it is necessary\nto infer the internal structure of the planet from limited\ndata. The situation is much more difficult for other bodies, where seismic data is at best extremely limited and\nmore usually absent.\nFor planetary structures, we are usually interested in\npressures from zero to a few hundred gigapascals. In\nthis range, EOS were originally deduced empirically from\nshock wave measurements [1]. Shock experiments typically explore states along the principal Hugoniot of a\nmaterial, which may be significantly hotter than the corresponding compression or pressure occurring in a selfgravitating body, and corrections are made to estimate\nthe pressure away from the Hugoniot [1]. More recently,\nmechanical presses such as diamond anvil cells have provided a source for isothermal compression in this regime,\nalthough the pressure calibration is made with respect\nto shock measurements on reference materials [2]. Samples may also be heated within presses, allowing a wide\nrange of states to be explored. In parallel with the evolution of experimental methods, theoretical techniques\nhave been developed to predict the EOS from first principles, typically with an a priori accuracy of a few percent\nin mass density, and better if adjusted to reproduce the\nSTP state [3]. Theoretical EOS are particularly useful as\nthermodynamically complete states can be calculated for\narbitrary loading conditions that may be experimentally\ndifficult either to induce or to measure. Theoretical EOS\ncan also be constructed fairly readily for different material compositions [4]. The prediction of phase diagrams is\nhowever typically less certain than the EOS for a single,\nknown phase.\nThe strength, failure, and plastic flow behaviors of materials are also important in planetary physics. The effects of strength must be taken into account when deducing the EOS from dynamic loading measurements, as\n\nthese are at high strain rates and non-hydrostatic conditions in contrast to the quasistatic conditions prevailing\nwithin self-gravitating bodies. Conversely, these properties are important for understanding dynamical processes\nincluding the formation of the body, the effect of impacts,\ncooling, volcanism, mantle convection, and plate tectonics. These constitutive properties are very challenging\nto predict theoretically, and models rely heavily on experimental measurements. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of strength in the heating induced\nby shocks and other dynamic loading [5]. Strength and\nflow stress can also change greatly with pressure and temperature. Recent advances in the measurement and modeling of plastic flow under extreme conditions has implications for astrophysical impacts, such as the interpretation of previous simulation studies using simpler material models. An example is the widely-quoted study that\na liquid interior allow impact energy to be transported\nmore efficiently to the antipode of an impact than would\nsolid components [6]. This conclusion relies strongly on\nthe assumptions used for material strength. If the flow\nstress increases sufficiently with compression, solid components can transport compression waves more efficiently\nthan can liquids.\nWe are constructing theoretical EOS for planetary materials of different composition, for use in simulations of\nastrophysical impacts, focusing on systematic differences\nin the shape and location of impact-produced structures\nbetween the rocky bodies. As a baseline for trial simulations, we report here the construction of structure models for the rocky planets using existing EOS of different sophistication. There is significant uncertainty over\nthe composition and temperature profile of all planetary\nbodies; here we use EOS for representative substances\nrather than for the current best estimates of composition, because a wider variety of EOS of different degrees\nof sophistication exist for our chosen materials. We optimize a single structure parameter \u2013 the core radius \u2013\nfor each combination of EOS. This approach is different\nfrom the commonly-used solution of the Emden equation\n[7, 8] where the compressibility of the planetary material\n\n\f2\nis assumed to vary linearly with pressure, and the parameters in this relation \u2013 i.e., the material properties \u2013 are\ndeduced from the observable properties of the planet.\nII.\n\nISOSTATIC STRUCTURES\n\nConsider a spherical body comprising compressible\nmaterial, of mass density \u03c1(r). Knowing or assuming\nin addition the distribution of composition and temperature, \u03c1(r) implies a pressure distribution p(r). The condition for isostatic equilibrium is that the stress induced\nby pressure variations is balanced by the gravitational\nacceleration g(r) and centripetal force:\ngrad p(r) = \u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c1(r)g(r)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the angular speed.\nFor Newtonian gravitation, by Gauss' theorem, g(r)\ncan be expressed in terms of the mass enclosed within a\ngiven radius m(r):\ng(r) =\n\nGm(r)\nr2\n\n(2)\n\nso\ndg(r)\n=G\ndr\n\n\u0012\n\nm(r)\n1 dm(r)\n\u22122 3\nr2 dr\nr\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nm(r) can be calculated simply from the distribution of\nmass density,\nm(r) = 4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nr\u2032\n\nr\u20322 \u03c1(r\u2032 ) dr\u2032\n\n(4)\n\n0\n\nor\ndm(r)\n= 4\u03c0r2 \u03c1(r).\ndr\n\n(5)\n\nIn the isostatic equilibrium structure, Eq. 5 can be\nintegrated from either the center or the surface r = R to\nobtain the complete structure. In practice, the material\nstate at the center depends on the material models used,\nso it is more useful to integrate from the surface, where\np = 0 and \u03c1 can be worked out simply for the outermost\nmaterial.\nUsually, the total mass M and outer radius R of the\nbody are known fairly well from observation of orbits\nand size respectively, and the problem is to establish the\ninternal structure. Starting with the assumption of a\nlayered structure, i.e. an ordering of composition, and\nthe p(\u03c1) relation for each layer, any unknown parameter\nin the structure can be fitted to give the desired total\nmass.\nFor example, consider a layered structure where the radius of one layer is unknown. For a stable configuration,\ninner layers have a higher density. Consider integration\ndownward from the surface as above, assuming a trial\nvalue for the unknown radius. If too large, the total mass\n\nM will be reached at some r > 0; if too small, m(0) > 0.\nThese two conditions can be used for a solution of this\nshooting problem by bracketing followed by bisection.\nAnother remotely observable structural parameter is\nthe moment of inertia I, which can be inferred from the\nrate of precession of the rotational pole about the normal\nto the orbit [9]. In the absence of seismic data, I is\na useful constraint on the structure of the body. The\nmoment of inertia for a sphere is\nZ\n8\u03c0 R\nI=\n\u03c1(r)r4 dr,\n(6)\n3 0\nand for self-gravitating bodies is conveniently expressed\nas the dimensionless moment of inertia ratio, I/M R2 .\nSimilar approaches assuming the EOS and deducing\nisostatic planetary structures have been reported previously. Kerley has calculated structures for Jupiter and\nSaturn, including rotational flattening, using the theory\nof figures and very detailed EOS [10]. Seager et al have\npredicted mass-radius relationships for solid exoplanets,\nusing EOS which are less suited to subsequent impact\nstudies and a different solution approach involving integration outward from the center of the planet [11].\nGrasset et al have similarly predicted mass-radius relationships for rocky and icy exoplanets, again using EOS\nwhich are less suited to impact studies [12].\nIII. COMPRESSIBILITY CURVES FOR\nDIFFERENT EQUATIONS OF STATE\n\nTwo types of EOS were considered: linear Gr\u00fcneisen\nEOS using a representative part of the principal shock\nHugoniot as reference, and more elaborate EOS constructions incorporating phase transitions and reproducing detailed features of the shock Hugoniot. The shock Hugoniot data used to calibrate the Gr\u00fcneisen EOS are reliable\nin the sense of being absolute, mechanical measurements,\nbut require the additional assumption of a thermal correction model to calculate states off the principal Hugoniot, as are required here.\nThere is considerable uncertainty in the composition\nof planetary interiors, and detailed EOS are not available for all compositions of interest. In order to calculate\nstructures for all the rocky planets without introducing\nadditional degrees of freedom in the individual compositions, the compositions were taken to be pure Fe in\nthe core, and basalt in the mantle. At zero pressure,\nbasalt typically comprises \u223c70% plagioclase (often andesite) and \u223c30% olivine, and is thus reasonably representative of the composition thought to occur through\nthe mantle. Further subdivision of layers was not considered; the structure chosen allowed the core radius to be\nused as a parameter to ensure the correct total mass for\neach body. Similar structure calculations using detailed\nEOS for other compositions will be reported separately.\nFor both Fe and basalt, the shock speed-particle speed\nrelation does not follow a straight line over the full pres-\n\n\f3\n\nsure range of interest. For basalt, a straight line was chosen that reproduced the principal Hugoniot at pressures\nof a few tens of gigapascals [13], as a representative range\nfor planetary mantles. Similarly, the fit to Fe shock data\nwas for pressures \u223c50-500 GPa [13]. The more detailed\nEOS for basalt was a tabulated Gr\u00fcneisen form using\nthree piecewise linear fits to the principal Hugoniot [14].\nThe detailed Fe EOS was an equilibrium construction\ncomprising four solid phases and the fluid, with mixedphase regions [15], and should be much more accurate\naway from the principal Hugoniot.\nIn the absence of accurately-known composition profiles, the use of simple EOS is desirable as it allows planetary structures to be optimized via the EOS parameters,\nthough this optimization was not done here. It is much\nmore cumbersome to optimize detailed EOS in this was,\nparticularly when presented in tabular form.\nThe compression curve used was the principal isentrope. This is a reasonable approach for large, selfgravitating objects. One would expect p(\u03c1) to be close to\nan isentrope on initial formation, as accretion proceeds\nby multiple small impacts followed by some stratification\nas dense components sink toward the center of the body.\nAfter formation, the decay of radionuclides (and possibly\nother processes such as tidal deformation and ohmic heating) may supply additional heat, but the surface of the\nbody cools by radiation. In the adiabatic compression of\nnon-porous condensed matter, the thermal contribution\nto pressure is usually much smaller than the repulsion\nbetween atoms, so the difference between the isentrope\nand the isotherm as extreme limits is small compared\nwith the other uncertainties in planetary structure such\nas the composition.\nEach EOS was used in the form p(\u03c1, e), and integrated\nnumerically starting at STP conditions to obtain p(\u03c1)\nalong the principal isentrope. The use of the principal\nisentrope for each constituent gives a discontinuity in\ntemperature where different layers meet, but the effect on\npressure is small compared with the uncertainties in composition and temperature. It would be straightforward,\nthough less efficient, to calculate the isentrope starting at\nthe temperature outside each layer. The isentropes for Fe\nagreed quite closely up to \u223c120 GPa; at higher pressures,\nthe linear Gr\u00fcneisen EOS was significantly stiffer. The\nlinear Gr\u00fcneisen EOS for basalt was much softer than\nthe tabular EOS at low pressures, and much stiffer at\nhigh pressures, with a crossover at 100 GPa.

The effect\nof rotation was ignored as it depends on latitude; rotation found to be a negligible effect in a trial equatorial\nintegration. The core radius was adjusted to give a density profile consistent with the specified total mass of the\nbody. The step size was chosen such that core radius was\nconverged numerically to 1 km. The resulting moment of\ninertia ratio was converged to 0.1%, which is better than\nmeasured values. The density near the center of the body\nwas very sensitive to small variations in the core radius\nor any other parameters, often giving unphysical variations for the innermost couple of tens of kilometers. The\nvolume and mass affected were negligible in comparison\nwith the overall body.\nUsing the linear Gr\u00fcneisen EOS for core and mantle,\nthe numerical scheme was very robust, and the core radius converged reliably for very wide ranges of the initial bracket. Using the tabular EOS, the initial bracket\nhad to be chosen much more carefully for a physical core\nradius to be found, because of the increased compressibility of the core. compressibility of core. Converged\nsolutions were however found for all the bodies considered and compared with observations of the moment of\ninertia ratio [16] and the usually-quoted values of the\ncore radius (Table II). We also summarize pressures calculated at the key locations of the mantle-core boundary\nand the center (Table III) as an indication of the regimes\ndesirable to explore experimentally, for each body.\nGiven that the EOS used were not for the most likely\nindividual core compositions that have been postulated\n(Fe-Ni, or Fe-S for Mars), and the planetary structures\nwere simplified, it is interesting to note that the core radius inferred for Earth \u2013 the only body for which it can be\n\n\f4\nTABLE II: Structure parameters for rocky bodies.\nbody\nreference\nlinear\ntabular\nGr\u00fcneisen\nrc I/M R2\nrc I/M R2\nrc I/M R2\n(km)\n(km)\n(km)\nMercury\n1600\n0.33 1740 0.3196 1802 0.3140\nVenus\n3000\n0.33 3014 0.3348 3167 0.3146\nEarth\n3481\n0.33 3361 0.3290 3405 0.3118\nMoon\n350 0.393 620 0.3647 752 0.3572\nMars\n1700\u00b1500\n0.366 1188 0.3621 1706 0.3316\n\nTABLE III: Key pressures in rocky bodies.\nbody\nlinear Gr\u00fcneisen\ntabular\ncenter\nboundary center boundary\n(GPa)\n(GPa) (GPa)\n(GPa)\nMercury 46.5\n9.6 47.5\n9.6\nVenus\n318\n121\n365\n120\nEarth\n390\n137\n448\n143\nMoon\n8.8\n5.0 10.0\n4.4\nMars\n45.2\n27.2 60.0\n20.7\n\nestimated using multiple techniques including seismology\n\u2013 is too small by only 2% for the tabular EOS and 3% for\nthe linear Gr\u00fcneisen. The core radius for the other bodies did not agree very well with the nominal values in the\nliterature, with the exception of Venus, but the difference\nwas commensurate with the uncertainty in radius. The\nexceptions were Venus, where the agreement was good at\n0.5-2% (the linear Gr\u00fcneisen EOS being the better), and\nthe Moon, where the present calculations were larger by\na factor \u223c2.\nFor the linear Gr\u00fcneisen EOS, the moment of inertia\nratios were within 3% except for the Moon, for which it\nwas too small by 7%. For the tabular EOS, the ratio\nwas systematically smaller: 4-5% except for the Moon\nand Mars (9 and 10% respectively). Too small a ratio\nimplies that the body is stiffer than the EOS used in the\ncalculation, in the sense that p would be greater for a\ngiven \u03c1. Such an increase in stiffness could reflect a difference in composition rather than too low a stiffness for\nthe material used. Thus the discrepancy for Mars could\nbe attributed to a significant proportion of S, reducing\nthe mass density for a given compression.\nThe linear Gr\u00fcneisen EOS gives pressures at the center\nof the Earth that are within the range of values in the\nliterature (360-390 GPa).\nWe next compare in more detail the structures predicted for each body by the different EOS.\n\n\f5\nMercury\n\n5\n\nFor Mercury, the EOS gave very similar pressure distributions. The core radius from each EOS was similar. The density distribution differed somewhat, particularly in the mantle. The pressure to induce the \u03b1-\u01eb\nphase change occurred just within the core, and showed\nup clearly in the density distribution. The gravitational\nacceleration from each EOS was similar. At the level of\ndetail considered here, the EOS were equivalent.

Two pairs of EOS were considered for Fe and basalt, either linear Gr\u00fcneisen fits to\nsubsets of published shock data, or more detailed EOS\nconstructions including phase changes and nonlinearities\nin the shock data. The core radius of Earth, which is\nby far the best known, was reproduced reasonably well\nusing both types of EOS. The other radii, and structures\nfor all the bodies, varied significantly between the EOS,\nthough to a varying degree. The structures were used to\ncalculate the moment of inertia ratio for each body, as\nan independent test of the accuracy of each structure.\nBetter overall agreement with the observed proper-\n\n[1] For instance, R.G.

This does not imply that the linear Gr\u00fcneisen EOS are more accurate models of Fe and\nbasalt, but that the properties of the bodies are represented more closely by the simpler EOS, presumably because the compositions deviate significantly from Fe and\nbasalt in the core and mantle respectively. The simpler\nEOS do not reproduce the moment of inertia ratios perfectly, and deviate particularly for the Moon and Mars.\nThe linear Gr\u00fcneisen EOS seem to be a reasonable\nstarting point for simulations of large-scale impacts on\nthese bodies, more so than the tabular EOS.
