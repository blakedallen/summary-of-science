In fact,\nspin density wave (SDW), charge density wave (CDW),\nreduced magnetic moment, and unconventional superconducting orderings occur in Ce-, Yb-, and U-based\ncompounds.1 The hybridization of the localized f electrons with conduction electrons (c-f hybridization) plays\nan important role in these transitions as well as a heavyfermion and intermediate-valence behaviors. The socalled hidden order in the heavy-fermion superconductor URu2 Si2 has attracted much attention.2\u20134 A \u03bb-type\nanomaly in the specific heat3,4 indicated a second order transition occurring at T0 = 17.5 K. The BCS-type\nspecific heat jump suggested an occurrence of SDW or\nCDW transition. The temperature dependence of specific\nheat below T0 revealed the formation of an energy gap\n(\u2206 \u223c 120 K) over a part of Fermi surface. A striking feature is the very small magnetic moment (0.03 \u03bcB /U) observed by neutron scattering experiments in the ordered\nstate5 which is inconsistent with a significant amount of\nmagnetic entropy of 0.2R ln 2 at T0 . Various models have\nbeen proposed to explain the hidden order parameter for\nthe phase transition in URu2 Si2 , but it remains undefined\nyet.6\nRecently, several research groups reported unusual\nproperties of CeT2 Al10 (T=Fe, Ru, and Os),7\u201310 whose\nphase transitions for T = Ru and Os resemble that in\nURu2 Si2 . These compounds crystallize in the orthorhombic YbFe2 Al10 -type structure (space group Cmcm, No.\n63).11,12 As shown in Fig. 1, the Ce atom is surrounded\n\nby 4 T and 16 Al atoms which form a polyhedron. The\nnearest-neighbor Ce atoms (dCe\u2212Ce = 5.25 \u00c5 for T =\nOs) construct a zigzag chain along the orthorhombic c\naxis. For T = Fe, a broad maximum at 70 K in the magnetic susceptibility is a characteristic of a valence fluctuation compound with the Kondo temperature TK = 360\nK.7 The thermal activation-type behaviors in both the\nelectrical resistivity and Hall coefficient below 20 K was\nattributed to the formation of a hybridization gap. The\ngap formation in CeFe2 Al10 has been confirmed by the\nstrong decrease of the 27 Al NMR Knight shift on cooling\nbelow 70 K.13\nOn the other hand, CeRu2 Al10 undergoes a phase\ntransition at T0 = 27 K as indicated by the \u03bb-type\nanomaly in the specific heat.8,10 The magnetic entropy\n\nFIG. 1. Crystal structure of CeOs2 Al10 . Large, middle, and\nsmall circles denote Ce, Os, and Al atoms, respectively. The\nCe atoms form a zigzag chain along the c axis.\n\n\f2\nup to T0 was estimated to be 0.75R ln 2. By the transition, the Sommerfeld coefficient \u03b3 is decreased from\n246 to 24.5 mJ/K2 mol.10 The electrical resistivity shows\na thermal activation-type behavior below 40 K, then\ndisplays a rapid increase below T0 and a peak at 23\nK. On further cooling, the resistivity decreases gradually. Similar anomalies have been observed for singlecrystal samples.10 The magnetic susceptibility is highly\nanisotropic \u03c7a > \u03c7c > \u03c7b , and \u03c7a (T ) follows the CurieWeiss law expected for the trivalent Ce ions. On cooling\nbelow T0 , \u03c7a (T ) suddenly decreases to a constant value.\nThe 27 Al-NQR signals for Al(1)-(4) sites split into two\nsignals, respectively, whereas no broadening was observed\nbelow T0 .14 The gap formation over a portion of Fermi\nsurface is deduced from the temperature dependence of\nspin-lattice relaxation rate. These results indicate that\nthe transition is not an antiferromagnetic or SDW one,\nbut is a structural transition which breaks the twofold\nsymmetry along the a axis. If no structural transition\noccurred, CeRu2 Al10 should be a good metal according\nto a band structure calculation assuming the space group\nCmcm.15\nCeOs2 Al10 also exhibits a phase transition at T0 = 29\nK,10 being very close to T0 in CeRu2 Al10 . However,\nabove T0 , the susceptibility of CeOs2 Al10 shows a pronounced maximum at 45 K which indicates stronger c-f\nhybridization than in CeRu2 Al10 . Another difference between the two systems appears in the resistivity in the\nordered state; the resistivity for T = Os displays a thermal activation-type temperature dependence below 15 K\nwhile that for T = Ru shows \"metallic\" behavior. Therefore, systematic investigations of CeT2 Al10 (T = Fe, Ru,\nand Os) with different values of TK is necessary to reveal the role of the c-f hybridization in the mysterious\nphase transition and gap formation. In this paper, we\nreport the results of structural and magnetic study via\nelectron diffraction experiments and the measurements\nof specific heat, magnetization, and magnetoresistance\non single crystals of CeOs2 Al10 .\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\nSingle crystals of CeOs2 Al10 were grown using an Al\nself-flux method in alumina crucible which was sealed in\nquartz tube under an Ar atmosphere of 1/3 atm. The\ncrucible was heated to 1100 \u25e6 C for 5 h and then cooled\nslowly to 750 \u25e6 C at which point the Al flux was spun off\nin a centrifuge. The obtained polyhedral single crystals\nhave typical dimensions of 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 mm3 . Electron-probe\nmicroanalyses indicated the composition of Ce : Os : Al\n= 1 : 1.9(5) : 10.0(5). Powder x-ray patterns confirmed\nthe orthorhombic YbFe2 Al10 -type structure with lattice\nparameters a = 9.1386, b = 10.2662, and c = 9.1852\n\u00c5. It should be noted that the previous report took the\nopposite notation for a and c axes.10\nTransmission electron microscopy observations were\nperformed at the acceleration voltage of 200 kV us-\n\nFIG. 2.\n[011] zone-axis electron diffraction pattern of\nCeOs2 Al10 obtained at 15 K. Superlattice reflections along\nthe [0\u221211] direction are indicated by arrows.\n\ning JEM2010F equipped with a liquid He cooling stage.\nMagnetization M (B) measurements up to 9.5 T were carried out by a capacitive Faraday technique with a field\ngradient of 10 T/m in the temperature range from 0.3 to\n30 K. The absolute value of M (B) was calibrated using\nthe data obtained by a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS). The electrical resistivity \u03c1(T ) and\nmagnetoresistance \u03c1(B) up to 14 T was measured in a\nlongitudinal configuration by an ac four-probe method.\nThe specific heat C(T ) under magnetic fields up to 14 T\nwas measured by a relaxation method. Measurements of\n\u03c1(B) and C(T ) were performed using a Quantum Design\nPPMS.\nIII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nA.\n\nElectron diffraction\n\nFigure 2 shows an selected area electron diffraction\npattern of CeOs2 Al10 at 15 K along [011] zone-axis.\nThe main reflections are indexed with the orthorhombic\nCmcm structure. In addition to the fundamental reflections, there exist weak superlattice reflections which are\ncharacterized by a wave vector q = (0, \u22122/3, 2/3). This\nresult suggests that the structure at temperatures below\nT0 is modulated with a threefold periodicity along the\n[01\u03041] direction.\nThe structural distortion in CeRu2 Al10 was found by\nthe observation of splitting of the 27 Al-NQR spectra. The\nbreakdown of the twofold symmetry along the a axis indicated lowering of the space group from Cmcm to either\nCm2m(Amm2) or P mnm(P mmn).14 In CeOs2 Al10 , on\nthe other hand, the modulation wave vector q maintains\nthe twofold symmetry along the a axis as well as the\nmirror symmetry perpendicular to the a axis because\nthe q vector is normal to the a axis. However, the q\nvector breaks both the twofold and mirror symmetry for\n\n\f3\n\nFigure 3(a) shows the magnetic susceptibility M/B(T )\nof CeOs2 Al10 single crystals and LaOs2 Al10 polycrystal.\nThe nearly T independent behavior and very small magnitude for LaOs2 Al10 indicate that the contribution of\nOs 5d electrons is negligible on the magnetic property of\nCeOs2 Al10 . In the whole measured T range, the relation\nMa > Mc > Mb holds, that is, the a axis is the easy\nmagnetization axis. Between 300 and 100 K, Ma /B(T )\nobeys the Curie-Weiss law, with the effective magnetic\nmoment \u03bcef f of 2.7 \u03bcB /Ce and paramagnetic Curie temperature \u03b8P of \u221230 K. These values are consistent with\nthose reported.10 A broad peak is depicted in Ma /B at\n45 K. At the transition temperature T0 = 29 K, M/B's\nfor all axes sharply decrease. The nearly T independent\nbehavior below 20 K is unlike the continuous decrease in\n\u03c7(T ) along the easy direction of an antiferromagnet.\nThe electrical resistivity is also anisotropic as shown in\nFig. 3(b). At high temperatures the \u2212 ln T dependence\nwith a maximum at 140 K is a characteristic of a Kondolattice compound. Both \u03c1a and \u03c1b exhibit a thermally\nactivation-type behavior \u03c1 = \u03c10 exp(\u2206/2kB T ) as shown\nby the dotted line in Fig. 3(b). The values of \u2206/kB are\nobtained as 30 and 50 K for a and b axes, respectively.\nThis behavior indicates the formation of a pseudo-gap\nat the Fermi level EF as in CeFe2 Al10 .7 Below T0 , \u03c1i\nshows further upturn and then a peak. Another activation behavior appears on cooling below 14 K, in contrast\nto the metallic behavior in CeRu2 Al10 . The semiconducting ground state in CeOs2 Al10 is consistent with the\nlow value of the Sommerfeld coefficient of 14 mJ/K2 mol,\nwhich is approximately half of that of CeRu2 Al10 .10\n\nC.\n\nIsothermal magnetization\n\nFigure 4 shows the result of Mi (B) measurement for\nB parallel to the orthorhombic principal axes at various\nconstant temperatures. Although Ma increases linearly\nwith increasing B up to 9.5 T, Mc exhibits a metamagnetic anomaly near 6 T at 0.3 K. The critical field B \u2217 ,\nwhich was determined as the peak position in the plot of\ndM/dB versus B, increases from 6.1 T at 0.3 K to 8.0\nT at 20 K. The metamagnetic anomaly disappears at 30\nK> T0 . This temperature dependence suggests that the\nmetamagnetic anomaly is not due to the crossing of Ce 4f\nlevels in the orthorhombic crystal field (CF).

This means that the crystal symmetry of CeOs2 Al10 is distorted to the monoclinic (possibly\nC2/m) structure by the phase transition. Preliminary\nx-ray diffraction experiments at low temperatures failed\nto detect any superlattice diffraction peak. To determine\nthe crystal symmetry in the ordered state, not only detailed electron diffraction experiments but also neutron\ndiffraction study are necessary.\n\nI || b\n\n200\n\n100\n\nI || c\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\nT (K)\n\nFIG. 3.

This indicates that dM/dB\nfor B > B \u2217 is almost independent of temperature. This\nbehavior becomes obvious in the dM/dB versus T plot\nin the inset of Fig. 4. At 5 T, dMc /dB decreases sharply\non cooling below T0 , in contrast with the very weak decrease in dMc /dB(T ) at 9.2 T.

For B||a, easy magnetization axis, \u2206\u03c1/\u03c10 exhibits a\nbroad peak at 4 T and then changes to negative at 6 T.\nThis behavior is similar to that observed in hybridization-\n\n\f4\n\nBc\n||\n\n1\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\nT (K)\n\n30\n\n0.3K\n\n20K\n\n0.04\n\nB*\n\nMc\nMb, 5K\n4\n\n6\n\nB (T)\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFIG. 4.

The step in \u2206\u03c1/\u03c10 disappears at 30\nK, that is consistent with the disappearance of metamagnetic anomaly at T > T0 .\n\nE.\n\nB || a,2 K\n-40\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nB (T)\n\nFIG. 5.\n(Color online) Longitudinal magnetoresistance\n[\u03c1(B) \u2212 \u03c1(0)]/\u03c1(0) of CeOs2 Al10 for B||a, B||b, and B||c at 2\nand 30 K.\n\n0.02\n\n2\n\nB || c,30 K\n\n-20\n\n30 K\n\n10K\n\n0\n\nB || b,2 K\n20\n\n0\n\nMa\n\n0.06\n\n0\n\n40\n\n(%)\n\n5T\n\nB || c,2 K\n\nCeOs2Al10\n\n0.3K\n10K\n\n2\n\nM (\n\nB\n\n/Ce)\n\n0.08\n\n9.2T\n\n0\n\ndM/dB (10\n\n-3\n\n0.10\n\n60\n\n3\n\n/\n\nemu/mol)\n\n0.12\n\nSpecific heat and B-T phase diagram\n\nIn order to examine the anisotropic dependence of T0\non magnetic field, we measured C(T ) under various constant fields for B||a and B||c. For B||c, the result of\nC/T of CeOs2 Al10 is plotted versus T in Fig. 6. As\nfor a reference, the data of the nonmagnetic counterpart LaOs2 Al10 is shown by the solid line, which has\nno anomaly above 2 K. From the C/T versus T 2 plot\nshown in the inset of Fig. 6, we obtained the values\nof Sommerfeld coefficient \u03b3 as 10 and 12 mJ/K2 mol for\nCeOs2 Al10 and LaOs2 Al10 , respectively. The smaller\n\nvalue of \u03b3 for CeOs2 Al10 relative to that of La counterpart supports the existence of pseudo-gap at EF . At 29\nK, CeOs2 Al10 displays a sharp \u03bb-type anomaly indicative\nof second-order phase transition. The transition temperature determined by the midpoint of jump in C(T ) is\nT0 = 28.6 K at B = 0. The magnitude of magnetic entropy Sm (T0 ) was calculated to be 0.3R ln 2 by the integration of [CCeOs2 Al10 \u2212CLaOs2 Al10 ]/T , whose value agrees\nwith the reported one.10 With increasing B, T0 decreases\nslowly to 28.2 K at 14 T. The robustness of the transition\nagainst magnetic field suggests that the phase transition\nin CeOs2 Al10 is not an antiferromagnetic order.\nFrom the results of C(T, B) and \u03c1(T, B), we constructed magnetic phase diagrams for B||a and B||c as\nshown in Fig. 7. The magnetic field dependence of T0\nfor B||a coincides with that for B||c. Thus, T0 hardly\nchanges under magnetic field up to 14 T, irrespective of\nthe field direction. Measurements of C(T, B) and \u03c1(T, B)\nat higher fields are necessary to determine the critical\nfield where the line of T0 (B) terminates.\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe absence of phase transition in LaOs2 Al10 indicates\nthe significant role of the Ce 4f electrons in the phase\ntransition of CeOs2 Al10 . However, the magnetic entropy\nSm (T0 ) is only 30% of R ln 2 that is expected for the\ndoublet ground state of localized Ce 4f state under the\northorhombic CF. In the ordered state of CeOs2 Al10 , we\nobserved the superlattice reflections at q = (0, \u22122/3, 2/3)\nin the transmission electron diffraction patterns. As for\nsuch a transition accompanying a structure modulation,\none can enumerate quadrupole, chage/spin Peierls, and\nCDW transitions. Conventional magnetic transitions are\nat variance with the absence of internal field at Al sites.\nThe quadrupole order of Ce 4f electrons is obviously\n\n\f0.8\n\nBc\n||\n\nCeOs2Al10\nC/T (J/K mol)\n\n0.6\n\n14 T\n\n20\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n10\n\n0\n0\n\nCeOs2Al10\n\n12\n\n2\n\n2\n\nC/T (J/K mol)\n\n5\n\n10\n\nT\n\n2\n\n20\n\nB a\n||\n\nB=0\n\n8 T\n\n8\n\n30\n\n2\n\n(K )\n\nM\nC\n\n4\n\n0\n\nB (T)\n\n5 T\n\n0\n\n0 T\n\n0\n\nT\n\nB c\n||\n\n12\n\n0\n\n8\n0\n\nB*\n\n4\nLaOs2Al10\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nT (K)\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nFIG. 6.

The inset shows the C/T versus T 2\nplot at B = 0.\n\nruled out because the doublet ground state possesses no\nquadrupole moment in the orthorhombic crystal structure. For the Peierls transition, one-dimensional instability associated with the dimerization is the prerequisite. Indeed, the Ce atoms form a zigzag chain along\nthe c axis, and the possibility of spin Peierls transition\nin CeRu2 Al10 induced by the dimerization of Ce moments along the zigzag chain has been proposed in recent\narticles.19,20 However, the dimerization, if it occurred on\nthe Ce chain, is incompatible with the three-fold periodicity along [01\u03041] direction observed as superlattice spots\nin CeOs2 Al10 . On the other hand, a CDW transition\nmay be possible in analogy with a Kondo semiconductor CeRhAs. CeRhAs has been considered as a system\nexhibiting CDW transitions originating from the fluctuating f electrons.21 This compound with the orthorhombic \u03b5-TiNiSi-type structure at 300 K is an intermediatevalence compound with the characteristic Kondo temperature TK = 1200 K.21 It undergoes successive phase\ntransitions at T1 = 370 K, T2 = 235 K, and T3 = 165\nK. The superlattice modulations with the wave vectors\nq1 = (0, 1/2, 1/2), q2 = (0, 1/3, 1/3), and q3 = (1/3, 0, 0)\nare observed at T1 , T2 , and T3 , respectively, and the gap\nsize is enlarged by the transition at T3 .22 It was pointed\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nT (K)\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nFIG. 7. (Color online) Magnetic phase diagram of CeOs2 Al10\nfor B||a and B||c constructed from the measurements of magnetization, resistivity, and specific heat.\n\nout that the transition at T3 is CDW one originating from\nthe charge modulation of Ce ions. In CeRhAs, there is\na zigzag chain of Ce ions along the orthorhombic a axis.\nThis chain is expected to play an important role in the\ntransition because of the large lattice contraction in the\na-direction relative to the other directions. In order to\nclarify the role of the Ce valence instability and the Ce\nzigzag chain for the transition in CeOs2 Al10 , a high resolution electron diffraction and neutron scattering study\non single crystals are needed.\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe electron diffraction experiments and the measurements of specific heat, magnetization, and magnetoresistance were performed to study the novel phase transition at T0 = 28.6 K in CeOs2 Al10 using single crystals.\nThe electron diffraction at 15 K revealed the structural\nmodification in the ordered state. The modulation wave\nvector indicates a three-fold periodicity along [01\u03041] direction. On cooling below 50 K, a transport gap of 30-50 K\nwas suggested by the activation-type behavior in the electrical resistivity along the three principal axes. Further\ndevelopment of the pseudo-gap in the density of states\nassociated with the phase transition was confirmed by\n\n\f6\nthe sharp decrease in the magnetic susceptibility along\nthe three axes. The magnetization and magnetoresistance display a metamagnetic anomaly and a step-like\nincrease, respectively, only when the field was applied\nalong the c axis at temperatures below T0 . The negative magnetoresistance in the longitudinal configuration\nfor B||a > 6 T indicates that the quasi-gap at the Fermi\nenergy is suppressed by the application of magnetic field\nalong the easy-magnetization axis. The three-fold periodicity as well as the sharp rise in the resistivity anomaly\nbelow T0 favors a CDW for the phase transition. On the\nother hand, the very weak decrease in T0 in magnetic\n\n\u2217\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\nymuro@hiroshima-u.ac.jp\nJ.
