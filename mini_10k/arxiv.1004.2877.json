On the one hand, the success of these\nmethods is related to the high quality of the phenomenological effective interactions used\n-Skyrme, Gogny or Relativistic Mean Field (RMF). On the other hand, the mean field\nmethod allows the inclusion of many correlations within a very simple intrinsic product\nwave function. Hence, bulk properties such as masses and radii are very well described at\nthe mean field level. However, in some cases this picture fails to take into account important\ncorrelations and methods beyond the mean field approach have to be applied. Furthermore,\nbecause the mean field is defined in the intrinsic frame it is mandatory to go beyond this\napproximation to evaluate excitation energies or transition probabilities in the laboratory\nsystem.\nThere are several methods to incorporate the correlations missing at the mean field level.\nNormally, the intrinsic wave functions are allowed to break relevant symmetries of the system, for example, particle number, rotational and translational invariance, parity, timereversal, etc. to enlarge the variational space and incorporate, for instance, deformation or\nsuperfluidity in the mean field picture. This leads to a degeneracy of the wave functions\nrotated in the gauge space associated to the broken symmetry. An appropriated superposition of these wave functions provides a symmetry conserving many-body wave function and\nan additional lowering of the energy of the system. In this way, using projection techniques\n[2], many correlations are obtained by restoring some or all of these symmetries . Furthermore, the mixing of different mean field configurations within the general framework of the\nGenerator Coordinate Method (GCM) [2] allows the inclusion of quantum fluctuations along\nsome relevant collective variables such as the multipole moments.\nMost of the currently used beyond mean field calculations with effective forces include two\nsymmetry restoration, i.e., particle number (PN) and angular momentum projection (AMP)\nand configuration mixing along the axial quadrupole deformation [1, 3, 4]. This approach\n(axial GCM-PNAMP) has been successfully applied to study many phenomena like, for example, the appearance or degradation of shell closures in neutron rich nuclei [3, 5\u20137], shape\n\n2\n\n\fcoexistence in proton rich Kr [8] or Pb [9, 10] isotopes or shape transitions in the A \u223c 150\nregion [11, 12]. However, the intrinsic wave functions used there were restricted to have\naxial symmetry, with K = 0, because this assumption simplifies considerably the angular\nmomentum projection and lightens the computational burden significantly. This restriction\nis one of the major drawbacks of the method because it limits its applicability to systems\nwhere triaxiality does not play an important role. However, many exciting experimental and\ntheoretical phenomena are closely related to the triaxial degree of freedom, for instance: the\npresence of \u03b3-bands in the low lying energy spectra and \u03b3-softness, shape coexistence and\nshape transitions in transitional regions [13, 15\u201320]; the lowering of fission barriers along the\ntriaxial path [21\u201323]; the influence of triaxial deformation in the ground state for the mass\nmodels [24, 25]; triaxiality at high spin [26\u201328]; the observation of K-bands and isomeric\nstates in the Os region [29\u201331]; or some other exotic excitation modes such as wobbling\nmotion and chiral bands [32\u201334].\nFrom the theoretical point of view some approaches beyond mean field have been proposed\nto study the triaxial effects. In particular, one of the most widely used is the collective\nHamiltonian [2] given in different versions depending on the underlying nucleon-nucleon\ninteraction used to define the collective potential, namely Pairing-plus-Quadrupole [35], Interacting Boson Model [36], Nilsson Woods-Saxon [26], Gogny [37\u201339] or RMF [40]. This\nmodel has been applied successfully to describe some of the experimental features mentioned above. However, the collective Hamiltonian can be understood as a gaussian overlap\napproach (GOA) of the triaxial GCM and this description should be improved including\nproperly the effects of the symmetry restoration and the full configuration mixing without\nany GOA approximation.\nIn the past, exact angular momentum projection with triaxial intrinsic wave functions\nwithout GCM have been carried out only for schematic forces and/or reduced configuration spaces. Examples are the projection of BCS [41] or Cranked Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov\n(CHFB) states [42] with the Pairing-plus-Quadrupole interaction, the projection of Cranked\nHartree-Fock (CHF) states (no pairing) with schematic [43] and full Skyrme interactions [44]\nor angular momentum projection before variation with particle number and parity restoration in limited shell model spaces [45, 46] .\nHowever, recent improvement of the computational capabilities enabled the first implementations of the angular momentum projection of triaxial intrinsic wave functions in the whole\n3\n\n\f(\u03b2, \u03b3) plane with effective forces. In particular, Bender and Heenen reported GCM calculations with particle number and triaxial angular momentum projection (PNAMP) with\nthe Skyrme SLy4 interaction [47]. In this work, the intrinsic wave functions were found by\nsolving the Lipkin-Nogami (LN) equations. On the other hand, Yao et al presented the\nimplementation of the triaxial angular momentum projection [48] and the extension to the\nGCM [49] for the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) framework. In the latter work no particle\nnumber projection has been performed and the mean field states are found by solving the\nRMF+BCS instead of the full HFB or LN equations. These approximations could lead to\na poor description of important pairing correlations, especially in the weak pairing regime\nwhere even spurious phase transitions appear [3, 50].\nIn this paper we present the first implementation of the Generator Coordinate Method with\nParticle Number and Angular Momentum Projected (GCM-PNAMP) triaxial HFB wave\nfunctions with the finite range density dependent Gogny force [51]. The finite range of the\nGogny force provides excellent pairing properties and is often used as a benchmark in this\nrespect. Furthermore it is able to provide at the same time both good global as well as spectroscopic properties [52, 53]. The intrinsic HFB states are found by solving the Variation\nAfter Particle Number Projection (VAP-PN) equations [54]. This fact constitutes the main\nmethodological difference with respect to the calculations reported in Ref. [47]. This is a\nvery important difference because VAP-PN allows the inclusion of the pairing correlations\nin a very efficient way yielding a significant improvement of the final results with respect to\nother approaches [3, 54].\nIn nuclei without strong mixing the so called Variation After Mean-field Projection In Realistic model spaces (VAMPIR) [45] approach has been very successful. In this approach only\none HFB wave function is considered which is determined by minimization of the projected\nenergy, i.e. the VAP approach for both the AM and the PN projections. A full VAMPIR\napproach with the Gogny force and large configuration spaces is not feasible yet. Instead we\nuse an approximation to it, which we call RVAMPIR and which as we shall see, in the case\nnucleus studied in this article, provides very reasonable results for the ground and \u03b3 bands\nwith much less effort than in the GCM approach.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we will give an overview of the theoretical\nframework. Then, we will focus our analysis on the nucleus\n\n24\n\nMg which has been studied\n\nas a test case in earlier implementations of the GCM-PNAMP method with Skyrme and\n4\n\n\fRelativistic interactions. In particular, in Sec. III we will show a standard axially symmetric\ncalculation which allows to make an educated guess for some relevant parameters needed in\nthe full calculation such as the number of major oscillator shells or the relevant deformations ranges. In Sec. IV we will analyze in detail the simpler PNAMP method, studying the\nconvergence of the integrals in the Euler angles, giving some consistency requirements and\nshowing the role of having an adequate mesh in the (\u03b2, \u03b3) plane. In Sec. V we will show\nthe final results for the calculated spectrum and B(E2) transitions strengths of\n\n24\n\nMg and a\n\ncomparison with experimental data. Finally, a brief summary and outlook on future work\nwill be addressed in Sec. VI.\n\nII.\n\nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK\nA.\n\nGenerator Coordinate Method with Particle Number and Angular Momentum\n\nProjected states (GCM-PNAMP)\n\nIn the present approach, the final many-body wave functions that describe the different\nstates of an even-even nucleus with Z(N ) number of protons (neutrons) are written as:\n|IM ; N Z\u03c3i =\n\nX\n\nI;N Z,\u03c3\n|IM K; N Z; \u03b2\u03b3i\nfK\u03b2\u03b3\n\n(1)\n\nK\u03b2\u03b3\n\nwhere (\u03b2, \u03b3) are quadrupole deformation parameters (see below), \u03c3 = 1, 2, ... labels the\nlevels for a given value of the angular momentum I and M, K are the projections of I~\nI;N Z,\u03c3\non the laboratory and intrinsic z\u2212axes respectively. The coefficients fK\u03b2\u03b3\nof the linear\n\ncombination are found by minimizing the energy within the non-orthogonal set of wave\nfunctions {|IM K; N Z; \u03b2\u03b3i}. These states are obtained by projecting the intrinsic meanfield states |\u03a6(\u03b2, \u03b3)i onto good particle number and angular momentum:\n|IM K; N Z; \u03b2\u03b3i =\nwith P\u0302 N =\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\nR 2\u03c0 i\u03c6(N\u0302 \u2212N )\ne\nd\u03c6\n0\n\n2I + 1 Z I\u2217\nDM K (\u03a9)R\u0302(\u03a9)P\u0302 N P\u0302 Z |\u03a6(\u03b2, \u03b3)id\u03a9\n8\u03c0 2\n\n(2)\n\nthe neutron number projector ( \u03c6 the associated gauge angle\n\nI\u2217\nand P\u0302 Z protons the proton number projector), R\u0302(\u03a9) and DM\nK (\u03a9) are the rotation operator\n\nand the Wigner matrices [55] in the Euler angles \u03a9 = (a, b, c) [69], respectively. In principle,\nthe ranges for these angles are (0 \u2264 a \u2264 2\u03c0, 0 \u2264 b \u2264 \u03c0, 0 \u2264 c \u2264 2\u03c0). However, for intrinsic\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) states (|\u03a6(\u03b2, \u03b3)i) which are symmetric under time-reversal\n5\n\n\fand simplex symmetries, the intervals for both gauge and Euler angles can be reduced to\n(0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c0/2) and (0 \u2264 a \u2264 \u03c0/2, 0 \u2264 b \u2264 \u03c0/2, 0 \u2264 c \u2264 \u03c0), respectively [47].\nThe wave functions (Eq. 2) are eigenstates of the particle number and angular momentum\noperators:\nN\u0302 |IM K; N Z; \u03b2\u03b3i = N |IM K; N Z; \u03b2\u03b3i,\n\n(3)\n\n\u1e90|IM K; N Z; \u03b2\u03b3i = Z|IM K; N Z; \u03b2\u03b3i,\n\n(4)\n\nI\u02c62 |IM K; N Z; \u03b2\u03b3i = h\u03042 I(I + 1)|IM K; N Z; \u03b2\u03b3i\n\n(5)\n\nI\u02c6z |IM K; N Z; \u03b2\u03b3i = h\u0304M |IM K; N Z; \u03b2\u03b3i,\n\n(6)\n\nI\u02c63 |IM K; N Z; \u03b2\u03b3i = h\u0304K|IM K; N Z; \u03b2\u03b3i\n\n(7)\n\nThe intrinsic HFB states (|\u03a6(\u03b2, \u03b3)i) are obtained by minimizing the particle-number proh\n\ni\n\njected energy functional E N,Z \u03a6\u0304(\u03b2, \u03b3) (variation after projection, VAP)[54]. This is one of\nthe most relevant parts in the calculation because the quality of the result largely depends\non the structure of the intrinsic HFB-type wave functions used. In contrast to other methods\nlike plain HFB or Projected Lipkin-Nogami (PLN), the VAP-PN performs the restoration\nof the particle number symmetry in an optimal way, including pairing correlations both in\nthe weak and strong pairing regimes [3]. This is especially relevant in GCM-like theories\nwhere a large grid of (\u03b2, \u03b3) points is needed. The strength of the pairing correlations has\na strong dependence on the single particle level density and the latter one itself with the\ndeformation parameters. This implies that a strongly (\u03b2, \u03b3) dependent oscillating pairing\nregime appears in the calculations and consequently theories like plain HFB (BCS) or PLN\n(LN) are unable to cope with this challenge providing wave functions of oscillating goodness.\nOnly a VAP-PN approach warrants high quality solutions independently of the (\u03b2, \u03b3) values.\nDealing with effective forces like Skyrme, Relativistic and Gogny, a natural separation of the\ninteraction into the two-body Hamiltonian \u01242b on the one hand and the density-dependent\npart, \u03b5N,Z\nDD [\u03a6] on the other emerges. In our case, we are using the Gogny D1S interaction\n[51] and \u01242b corresponds to the kinetic energy (the two-body part from the center of mass\ncorrection included) plus the spin-orbit, Coulomb and the finite range central potentials.\nIn the calculations, all direct, exchange and pairing terms are included [56]. The VAP-PN\n\n6\n\n\fprinciple, provides\nh\n\ni\n\n\u03b4E N,Z \u03a6\u0304(\u03b2, \u03b3)\n\n=0\n\n(8)\n\n\u03a6\u0304=\u03a6\n\nwhere:\nE N,Z [\u03a6] =\n\nh\u03a6|\u01242b P\u0302 N P\u0302 Z |\u03a6i\n+ \u03b5N,Z\nDD [\u03a6] \u2212 \u03bbq20 h\u03a6|Q\u030220 |\u03a6i \u2212 \u03bbq22 h\u03a6|Q\u030222 |\u03a6i\nN\nZ\nh\u03a6|P\u0302 P\u0302 |\u03a6i\n\n(9)\n\nIn a beyond mean field method, and in particular for the particle number projection, we\nneed a reasonable prescription for the spatial density, which we shall call \u03c1int (~r), that enters\nin \u03b5N,Z\nDD [\u03a6], the density dependent term of the interaction. In this work, assuming the\nphenomenological nature of these interactions and considering that the restoration of the\nparticle number symmetry is performed not in the coordinate but in the gauge space, we\nhave chosen the number projected spatial density prescription that has proven to be free\nof divergences [54] and to give very good results for describing many phenomena along the\nnuclear chart:\nh\u03a6|\u03c1\u0302(~r)P N P Z |\u03a6i\n(10)\nh\u03a6|P N P Z |\u03a6i\nR\nwith \u03c1\u0302(~r) \u2261 d~r0 \u03b4(~r \u2212 ~r0 ). As shown in [54] for the PNP and in [57] for the Lipkin-Nogami\nZ\n\u03c1N\nr) \u2261\nint (~\n\napproach, the use of the projected density or the so-called mixed prescription (in the case\nwhen the latter is free of potential divergences) provide very similar results. Furthermore,\nwe see in Eq. 9 that the minimization is performed under constraints on the quadrupole deformation operators Q\u03022\u03bc . The Lagrange multipliers \u03bbq2\u03bc ensure that the following conditions\nare fulfilled in the intrinsic state:\n\u03bbq20 \u2192 h\u03a6|Q\u030220 |\u03a6i = q20\n\u03bbq22 \u2192 h\u03a6|Q\u030222 |\u03a6i = q22\n\n(11)\n\nIn addition, the deformation parameters (\u03b2, \u03b3) are directly related to (q20 , q22 ) by:\ns\n\n\u03b2 cos \u03b3\n\u03b2 sin \u03b3\n5\n4\u03c0\n; q22 = \u221a\n; C=\n(12)\nq20 =\n2 5/3\nC\n4\u03c0 3r0 A\n2C\nbeing r0 = 1.2 fm and A the mass number. These constraints allow to explore the (\u03b2, \u03b3)\nplane to generate the wave functions to be used in the configuration mixing calculations.\nWe now describe the Generator Coordinate Method (GCM) to obtain the final spectrum\nI;N Z,\u03c3\n(E I;N Z;\u03c3 ) and the coefficients fK\u03b2\u03b3\ngiven in Eq. 1. Minimization of the energy with respect\nI;N Z,\u03c3\nto the coefficients fK\u03b2\u03b3\nleads to the Hill-Wheeler-Griffin (HWG) equation\n\nX \u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nI;N Z\nI;N Z\nI;N Z;\u03c3\nI;N Z;\u03c3\nHK\u03b2\u03b3K\nNK\u03b2\u03b3K\n0\u03b20\u03b30 \u2212 E\n0 \u03b2 0 \u03b3 0 fK 0 \u03b2 0 \u03b3 0 = 0,\n\nK 0\u03b20\u03b30\n\n7\n\n(13)\n\n\fwhich has to be solved for each value of the angular momentum.

In the latter, we have used the particle number projected spatial density combined with the mixed\nprescription for the angular momentum projection and GCM part, namely:\nZ\n\u03c1N\nr) \u2261\nint (\u03a9, ~\n\nh\u03a6|\u03c1\u0302(~r)R\u0302(\u03a9)P N P Z |\u03a60 i\n.\nh\u03a6|R\u0302(\u03a9)P N P Z |\u03a60 i\n\n(15)\n\nThis prescription is suitable for dealing with the restoration of broken symmetries in the\ncoordinate space such as the rotational invariance or the spatial parity.\nOnce we have calculated the corresponding GCM overlaps, the next step consists in solving\nthe HWG equations (Eq. 13).

Detailed expressions for calculating these reduced matrix elements for B(E2) transitions and spectroscopic quadrupole\nmoments within this framework can be found elsewhere [5, 47, 49].\n\nB.\n\nSimpler approaches: Particle Number and Angular Momentum Projection\n\n(PNAMP) and the RVAMPIR approximation\n\nThe expressions given above constitute the most general framework that we are using for\nsolving the nuclear many body problem. Nevertheless, there are some limiting cases with a\nrelevant physical meaning that can be deduced in a straightforward manner from them. The\nfirst one is the particle number projection (PNP) that has been discussed above (Eq. 9).\nThe second approach is the particle number and angular momentum projection (PNAMP)\nof a single point in the (\u03b2, \u03b3) plane. Here, the wave function is of the form of Eq. 1 but\nwithout the mixing in the deformation parameters:\n|IM ; N Z; \u03bd; \u03b2, \u03b3i =\n\nX I;N Z,\u03bd\n\nhK\n\n(\u03b2\u03b3)|IM K; N Z; \u03b2\u03b3i,\n\n(22)\n\nK\n\nwhere the label \u03bd stands for the (2I + 1) different states that can be obtained with the\nangular momentum projection. However, due to the time reversal and simplex symmetries\nimposed on the intrinsic wave functions, this number is reduced to (I/2 + 1) and ((I \u2212 1)/2)\nstates for even and odd values of I, respectively. Moreover, if we furthermore have axial\nsymmetry, only one state can be obtained and only for even values of I.\n9\n\n\fZ,\u03bd\nThe coefficients hI;N\n(\u03b2\u03b3) and the PNAMP energies E I;N Z;\u03bd (\u03b2, \u03b3) are found by solving the\nK\n\nsimplified version of the HWG equation (see Eq. 13):\nX\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nI;N Z\nI;N Z\nI;N Z;\u03bd\nI;N Z;\u03bd\nHK\u03b2\u03b3K\n(\u03b2, \u03b3)NK\u03b2\u03b3K\n(\u03b2, \u03b3) = 0.\n0 \u03b2\u03b3 \u2212 E\n0 \u03b2\u03b3 hK 0\n\n(23)\n\nK\n\nThe remaining expressions used to solve the HWG equations are simplified in the same\nmanner, i.e., removing the sum over (\u03b2, \u03b3) from the equations and evaluating only the\ndiagonal part. In addition, the collective wave functions FKI;N Z;\u03bd (\u03b2, \u03b3) (Eq. 19), which in\nI;N Z;\u03bd\nanalogy we shall call HK\n(\u03b2, \u03b3), now give the spectral distribution in the K space of the\n\ncorresponding PNAMP state.\nA full variation of the HFB wave function in the VAP approach, in the spirit of VAMPIR,\nfor the PN and the AM with large configuration spaces and the Gogny interaction is not yet\nfeasible. However we can use an approximation to VAMPIR, which we shall call from now\non RVAMPIR, in which the PN is handled in the VAP approach and the AM in a Restricted\nVAP (RVAP) one. The RVAP approximation has been thoroughly studied in [58]-[59].\nIn the VAP method the whole Hilbert space associated with the HFB transformation is\nscanned in the variational procedure. In the RVAP method, however, only a restricted\nvariational space of highly correlated wave-functions is allowed in the minimization process.\nMonopole (pairing) and quadrupole (\u03b2 and \u03b3) correlations are believed to be the most\nrelevant degrees of freedom of atomic nuclei and are related to the particle number and the\nangular momentum symmetries, respectively. Since we are considering the PN symmetry in\nthe VAP theory it seems reasonable in our case to consider the restricted Hilbert space to\ncontain a whole set of quadrupole deformed wave-functions |\u03a6(\u03b2, \u03b3)i which parametrically\ndepend on (\u03b2, \u03b3). This procedure is justified by theoretical arguments [2] which establish\nthat a VAP approach is needed for systems with weakly broken symmetries, like in the\nPN case where only a few Cooper pairs participate, but it can be approximated in case\nof strongly broken symmetries, such as deformation, where a large number of nucleons\nparticipate. Concerning the differences of this approximation as compared to VAMPIR it is\nclear [58] that if, besides of considering the quadrupole moments Q\u030220 and Q\u030222 in Eq. 9, we\nwill include higher multipole moments Q\u0302LM to increase the variational space, our solution\nwould get very close to the one of the genuine VAMPIR. With respect of the quality of our\napproach (again with respect to the full VAMPIR) we expect that in general it will be very\nsimilar and only in very soft nuclei, where higher modes (hexadecupole for example) are\n10\n\n\fvery relevant, differences may arise. But for very soft nuclei we have to question also the full\nVAMPIR since a GCM-like approach will be more appropriate. That means, RVAMPIR is\nnot as \"restricted\" as its name might imply.\nSpecifically the basic RVAMPIR approach consist of the following steps:\nA.- At each (\u03b2i , \u03b3i ) value of a given set of points in the (\u03b2, \u03b3) plane the following items\nare performed:\nA1.- Solve the VAP-PN equations, Eqs.8-9, to determine the \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 constrained HFB\nwave function |\u03a6(\u03b2, \u03b3)i.\nA2.- Carry out simultaneous particle number and angular momentum projection on\nthe wave function |\u03a6(\u03b2, \u03b3)i, what we have called |IM K; N Z; \u03b2\u03b3i, see Eq. 2, to\nform the linear combination of the state |IM ; N Z; \u03bd; \u03b2\u03b3i in Eq. 22.\nA3.- Solve the HWG equation, Eq.23, for different angular momenta.\nB.- For each value of the angular momentum sort out the energies E I;N Z;\u03bd (\u03b2, \u03b3) of Eq. 23\nI;N Z;\u03bd\nI\nI\nI\nI\n)\n, \u03b3min\n) providing the energy minimum Emin\n(\u03b2min\n, \u03b3min\nand find out the point (\u03b2min\nI\nI\n) provide I/2+1((I \u22121)/2)\n, \u03b3min\nC.- The solutions of the HWG equation at the points (\u03b2min\n\nstates for even (odd) I values, which allow to build a partial spectrum and to calculate\nthe transition probabilities among the different states or any other observable.\nOne has to notice that all RVAMPIR states are orthogonal, those with different AM\nin an obvious way and those with the same AM because they are solution of the same\neigenvalue equation.\nIn the following sections we will give some examples of the convergence, consistency and\nperformance of the methods described above. All the many body intrinsic wave functions\nand operators have been expanded in a cartesian harmonic oscillator single particle basis\nclosed under rotations [60]. In particular, the rotation operator R\u0302(\u03a9) has been evaluated\nfollowing the expressions given in Ref. [61] and the Neergard method [62] has been used\nin the calculation of the norm overlaps in order to determine the correct sign of the\nOnishi formula [63\u201365]. The overlaps of a generic operator have been calculated using the\ngeneralized Wick theorem [64].\n\n11\n\n\fIII.\n\nAXIAL CALCULATIONS FOR\n\n24 MG\n\nDue to the huge computational cost of the full triaxial calculation, it is important to\nstudy first the axial case (with K = 0) in order to fix some relevant quantities. The most\nimportant ones are the region of \u03b2 deformation to be included in the calculation and the\nnumber of major oscillator shells in which the mean field wave functions are expanded. The\ncomputational effort depends critically on these quantities and it is important to ensure the\nconvergence of the results, at least in the axial case, to have a reasonable choice which then\nlater allows to perform the full triaxial calculation.\nThe main advantage of considering only axial symmetric (K = 0) intrinsic wave functions\n|\u03a6(\u03b2, \u03b3 = 0\u25e6 , 180\u25e6 )i \u2261 |\u03a6(\u03b2)i is that the integration over the Euler angles (a, c) can be\ndone analytically and this fact reduces drastically the computational time. The simplified\nexpressions of the axial GCM-PNAMP method can be found in detail in Ref. [5]. We first\nanalyze the results obtained for the nucleus\n\n24\n\nMg using Nshells = 7 oscillator shells and\n\nNpoints = 31 intrinsic wave functions distributed in the interval (\u22121.5 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 1.5) with positive and negative values of \u03b2 corresponding to prolate \u03b3 = 0\u25e6 and oblate \u03b3 = 180\u25e6 shapes.\nThe integration over the gauge angle \u03c6 for the particle number projection part has been\nperformed using the Fomenko expansion [66] while for the integration over the Euler angle b\na Gaussian-Legendre quadrature has been used. We have chosen NF om = 9 and Nb = 16 as\nthe number of integration points for the particle number and the angular momentum parts\nof the projection, respectively. With these assumptions the expectation values for the N\u0302 , \u1e90,\nN\u0302 2 , \u1e90 2 and I\u02c62 operators differ by less than 10\u22128 from the corresponding eigenvalues. In Fig.\n1(a) we plot the potential energy surfaces (PES) along the \u03b2 direction for the VAP-PN and\nPNAMP approaches. The VAP-PN curve shows two differentiated minima separated by a\nbarrier of \u223c 7.7 MeV, the lowest one at prolate deformation (\u03b2 = 0.5) and the other one in\nthe oblate part (\u03b2 = \u22120.2) . These minima are shifted towards larger deformations when the\nangular momentum projection is performed. In particular, a well defined prolate minimum\nappears at \u03b2 = 0.6 for I = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 showing that a rotational band will develop from this\nintrinsic state. For the ground state the gain in correlation energy due to the restoration of\nthe rotational symmetry amounts to \u223c 3.9 MeV. In the oblate part, we observe a minimum\nat \u03b2 = \u22120.4 for I = 0, 2 while for higher values of the angular momentum the minimum\nvanishes.

Hence,\nonce the HWG equations are solved, we select as the final solutions those that belong to a\nplateau in the energy as a function of the number of states in the natural basis (Eq. 17) and\nfulfill the orthonormality condition. To avoid duplications a detailed discussion on these\nissues is postponed to the triaxial case.

In these figures we can see\nthat the \u03c3 = 1 states are members of a rotational band, with most of the intensity of the\ncollective wave functions concentrated around \u03b2 = 0.6. This deformation corresponds to\nthe location of the prolate minima of the different potential wells. The ground state 0+\n1 also\nhas a small mixing with the oblate minimum at \u03b2 = \u22120.5. The situation is rather different\nfor the \u03c3 = 2 states. The second 0+ state is a mixing of oblate and prolate configurations,\nwhile wave function of the 2+\n2 state peaks in the oblate minimum of the corresponding PES\nand the 4+\n2 state could be considered as a vibration built on the I = 4 prolate well with\na small contribution of slightly oblate states. In the 2+\n3 state the prolate deformations are\nagain favored. Remembering that the purpose of this axial calculation is to determine the\nrange of values of \u03b2 needed to obtain converged results in the low-lying energy spectrum,\nwe observe in Fig. 1(b)-(c) that all the collective wave functions studied here drop to zero\nat the boundaries. A smaller interval, however, could not be sufficient for describing correctly the collective states. In addition, we have checked the convergence of the results as a\nfunction of the number of the points included in the GCM-PNAMP. Increasing this number\nto Npoints = 61 still yields very similar results for the PES, GCM-PNAMP energies and the\ncollective wave functions as compared to the ones obtained for Npoints = 31.\nFinally, in order to test the convergence with the number of oscillator shells, we have performed a calculation with Nshells = 11 and Npoints = 31. It is noteworthy that for a triaxial\ncalculation, the computational time for Nshells = 11 is \u223c30 times larger than the one used\nfor Nshells = 7. Although this fact complicates the applicability of this method for heavy\nnuclei, for lighter systems the calculation with a smaller number of oscillator shells could\n\n14\n\n\fstill be sufficient. This is the case for 24 Mg, where the PES and the collective wave functions\ncalculated with Nshells = 11 (not shown) are very similar to the Nshells = 7 results. In Fig. 2\nwe compare the spectra obtained in the two calculations and observe a relative error of less\nthan 10% for all the levels. While the members of the \u03c3 = 1 bands almost match each other,\nsmall differences are found in the \u03c3 = 2 band. This comparison justifies that all further\ncalculations are performed withNshells = 7.\n\nIV.\n\nCONVERGENCE AND CONSISTENCY OF THE TRIAXIAL PNAMP\n\nIn this section we will study some aspects of the simultaneous particle number and angular momentum projection with triaxial shapes. Firstly, it is important to note that the\nparametrization of the quadrupole deformation in terms of (\u03b2, \u03b3) variables gives a triple degeneracy in the range 0\u25e6 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 360\u25e6 if we consider time-reversal conserving wave functions\n[2]. This degeneracy corresponds to the three possible orientations of the intrinsic axis I3\nwith respect to the z\u2212axis (see Fig. 3). Therefore, the interval 0\u25e6 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 60\u25e6 covers all the\npossible quadrupole deformations. However, we can take advantage of this symmetry first\nto improve the convergence of the integral in the Euler angles that must be carried out in\nthe PNAMP calculation (Eq. 2) and second to perform consistency checks of the results.\nWe now study the convergence of the integral in the Euler angles with respect to the number\nof integration points in \u03a9 = (a, b, c). We have considered the symmetries of the intrinsic\nwave function reducing the integration interval to (0 \u2264 a \u2264 \u03c0/2, 0 \u2264 b \u2264 \u03c0/2, 0 \u2264 c \u2264 \u03c0)\n(see Refs. [42, 47, 48]) and we have used Gaussian-Legendre quadratures for the numerical\nintegration. As in the axial case, the number of integration points for the particle number\nprojection is kept to NF om = 9, which is sufficient to get eigenstates of the particle number\noperators. Naturally, the best candidate to check the convergence of the angular momentum projection is the expectation value of the total angular momentum operator I\u02c62 that,\nconsidering Eq. 5, must be:\nI\u2217\nDKK\n(\u03a9)h\u03a6|I\u02c62 R\u0302(\u03a9)P N P Z |\u03a6id\u03a9\n2\n\u02c6\n= h\u03042 I(I + 1).\nhI iIK = R I\u2217\nN\nZ\nDKK (\u03a9)h\u03a6|R\u0302(\u03a9)P P |\u03a6id\u03a9\n\nR\n\n(24)\n\nThe convergence in the number of integration points depends on three factors, namely the\norientation of the intrinsic axes, the values of (I, K) and the deformation \u03b2. Let us start\nwith the two latter factors. In Fig. 4 we plot the mean value of the total angular momentum\n15\n\n\fFIG. 3: (Color online) Orientations of the intrinsic deformation as a function of the \u03b3 parameter.\n\u03b3 = 0\u25e6 , 120\u25e6 , 240\u25e6 and \u03b3 = 60\u25e6 , 180\u25e6 , 300\u25e6 correspond to axial symmetric prolate and oblate shapes,\nrespectively.\n\noperator as a function of \u03b2 for projected wave functions with I = 2, 6 and a fixed value of\n\u03b3 = 50\u25e6 . The integration has been performed with two sets of integration points in (a, b, c),\nS1 = (6, 16, 12) and S2 = (16, 16, 32). Here, we can observe that for the set S2 the correct\nresult of the eigenvalue is obtained for all \u03b2 and I, K. However, the set S1 fails both for\nlarge values of \u03b2 for all I, K and also for smaller deformations with high K = 4, 6. The\npoor performance of this choice is clearly seen in the latter case where substantial deviations\nfrom the correct number are observed. Therefore, as a rule of thumb, the larger the values\nof (I, K) and \u03b2 the more integration points are needed to have good results. The final\nchoice will be the one that is able to provide converged results for all (I, K, \u03b2, \u03b3) values.\nTaking into account that the symmetry axis corresponds to pure K = 0 states, one may\nassume that close to the symmetry axis only small K-components are present. We therefore\nexamine the role of the orientation of the intrinsic axes in the PNAMP method. First, we\nexplore the convergence of the angular momentum projection using the property given in\n\n16\n\n\f8\n\n_\n\n<I 2> / h 2\n\n7.5\n\n!=50 :\n\n7\n\nS1\nS2\n\nI=2;K=2\n\nI=2;K=0\n\n6.5\n6\n5.5\n5\n44\n\n_\n\n<I 2> / h 2\n\n43.5\nI=6;K=0\n\nI=6;K=2\n\nI=6;K=4\n\nI=6;K=6\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\"\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\"\n\n43\n42.5\n42\n41.5\n41\n44\n\n_\n\n<I 2> / h 2\n\n43.5\n43\n42.5\n42\n41.5\n41\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Expectation values of the total angular momentum operator calculated with\nangular momentum projected states |IKi as a function of the \u03b2 deformation (\u03b3 = 50\u25e6 ) and for\ndifferent sets of integration points in the Euler angles (a, b, c) (red circles S2 = (16, 16, 32), black\nfilled boxes S1 = (6, 16, 12).

If\nour assumption is right, we could reduce the number of integration points using instead a\ngiven wave function an equivalent intrinsic wave function with an orientation closer to the\nK = 0 case. In Fig. 5 we plot as a function of \u03b2 the expectation values of the angular\nmomentum operator for intrinsic states with \u03b3 = 50\u25e6 and also with \u03b3 0 = 170\u25e6 . The sets of\nintegration points are the same as in Fig. 4. For the set S1 with \u03b3 = 50\u25e6 we observe again\nthe loss of convergence whenever \u03b2 and I increase. However, very much improved results are\nobtained for the same set of integration points, S1 , but projecting the wave functions with\nthe \u03b3 = 170\u25e6 orientation. In addition, the calculation with the set S2 reveals the numerical\norigin of the lack of convergence for the set S1 with \u03b3 = 50\u25e6 . Therefore, we will use this\nproperty to define the mesh in the (\u03b2, \u03b3) plane for performing GCM-PNAMP calculations\n17\n\n\f2\n\n1\n0.5\n\n!=50 :\n\n7.5\n\n!=170 :\n\nS1\n\n7\n\nI=0;K=0\n\nI=2;K=0\n\n6.5\n\n0\n\n6\n\n14\n\n22\n\n13.5\n\n21.5\n\n13\n\n21\n\nI=3;K=2\n\n12.5\n\n20.5\n\n12\n\n20\n\n44\n\n74\n\n43.5\n\n73.5\n\nI=4;K=0\n\n_\n\n<I 2> / h 2\n\n_\n\n<I 2> / h 2\n\n_\n\n<I 2> / h 2\n\n1.5\n\n8\nS1\nS2\n\n43\n\n73\n\nI=6;K=0\n\n42.5\n\n72.5\n\n42\n\n72\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\"\n\nI=8;K=0\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\"\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Expectation values of the total angular momentum operator between angular\nmomentum projected states I = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8; K = 0 and I = 3; K = 2 as a function of the \u03b2\ndeformation and for different sets of integration points in the Euler angles and orientation of the\nintrinsic axes, red circles S2 = (16, 16, 32), black filled boxes S1 = (6, 16, 12) with \u03b3 = 50\u25e6 and blue\nfilled diamonds with \u03b3 = 170\u25e6 .\n\nas we will see below.\nThe analysis shown in Figs. 4 and 5 has been performed with diagonal matrix elements.\nSince in the GCM calculations we have to consider also non-diagonal matrix elements, we\nhave extended our study to this case.

We can also exploit the degeneracy illustrated in Fig. 3\nto perform a consistency test of the implementation of the PNAMP method [47].

A similar relation applies for the transition probabilities. In Fig. 6 we show\nthe excitation energies and reduced transition probabilities B(E2) calculated with the same\noblate axially symmetric wave function (\u03b2 = 0.625) but oriented differently in space with\n\u03b3 = 60\u25e6 (left panel) and \u03b3 = 180\u25e6 (right panel). As expected, we find that the \u03b3 = 60\u25e6\nexcitation spectrum and transition probabilities are K-independent and therefore identical\nto the mixed ones. A look to the right panel corroborates also that these quantities coincide with the ones generated with the \u03b3 = 180\u25e6 intrinsic wave function. Once we have\nanalyzed the convergence and consistency of the PNAMP method for a given point in the\n(\u03b2, \u03b3) plane we can study the potential energy surfaces (PES) for the different approaches\n(VAP-PN, PNAMP with and without K-mixing). We explore first the role of the mesh of\npoints needed to cover all different triaxial shapes. Given the better convergence properties\nfor wave functions with a large K = 0 component (compare Fig. 5), we divide the calculation\ninto two regions, \u03b3 \u2208 [0\u25e6 , 30\u25e6 ] and \u03b3 \u2208 [150\u25e6 , 180\u25e6 ] (see Fig.7). The last interval is equivalent\nto \u03b3 \u2208 [30\u25e6 , 60\u25e6 ] and we will transform the results to it whenever we plot the different PES\nthroughout this paper. Furthermore, the resolution of the PES is affected by the way we\nperform the discretization of the plane.

The number of points is Npoints = 99\nin both cases. We observe that the distribution of the points in constant steps is not the\nbest choice neither for small \u03b2, where for many points almost degenerated states are obtained, nor for large \u03b2, where a loss of resolution in \u03b3 is observed for increasing values of \u03b2.\nIt is precisely in this region where the interpolation between distant points produces artifacts or wrong results in the PES such as spurious oscillations, as for example in the region\n(\u03b2 \u2208 [1.0, 1.2], \u03b3 \u2208 [20\u25e6 , 40\u25e6 ]) or softening of the contour plots (\u03b2 \u2208 [0.6, 1.1], \u03b3 \u2208 [50\u25e6 , 60\u25e6 ]).\nThis is rectified with a discretization based on triangles and the results presented hereafter\nare calculated with this mesh. Nevertheless, although only small differences around the minimum of the PES are obtained in the case of\n\n24\n\nMg, these effects will be enhanced for rather\n\n\u03b3-soft and moderate \u03b2 deformed nuclei. In those cases, the division based on triangles will\ngive much better results for the same number of total points included in the calculation and\nwill save computing time with respect to the other mesh.\n\n20\n\n\fV.\n\nTRIAXIAL CALCULATIONS FOR\n\n24 MG\n\nIn the previous sections we have studied several aspects needed to ensure a good performance of the full generator coordinate method with the particle number and triaxial angular\nmomentum projected wave functions. This previous research is important because the full\nGCM-PNAMP calculation is very demanding in CPU-time and both convergence tests and\nthe choice of the relevant parameters should be performed in advance, but nonetheless also\nchecked afterwards. In this section the final results for 24 Mg are presented, their calculation\nas mentioned above, have been done with the set of integration points in the Euler angles\n(Na = 8, Nb = 16, Nc = 16). We choose the triangular mesh with Npoints = 99 shown in\nFig. 7 to solve the constrained particle number projection before the variation (VAP-PN)\nequations. The intrinsic many body wave functions |\u03a6(\u03b2, \u03b3)i are expanded in a cartesian harmonic oscillator basis and the number of spherical shells included in this basis is Nshells = 7\nwith an oscillator length of b = 1.01A1/6 . In Fig. 7 the VAP-PN energy landscape is plotted\nshowing a single and well defined minimum at \u03b2 = 0.5, \u03b3 = 0\u25e6 separated by \u223c 7.7 MeV\nfrom the spherical point and \u223c 6.1 MeV from the oblate saddle point at \u03b2 = 0.25. These\nresults are consistent with the ones obtained in the axial calculation (see Fig. 1) with the\ndifference of having a saddle point in the (\u03b2, \u03b3) plane instead of a minimum on the oblate\nside. Similar PES are obtained for Skyrme (HFB with particle number projection after\nvariation (PN-PAV) included) [47] and Relativistic (BCS without PNP) [48] interactions\nalthough a softer surface between the spherical point and the minimum is obtained for the\nSkyrme interaction.\n\nA.\n\nTriaxial PNAMP potential energy surfaces and the RVAMPIR approach for\n\n24 Mg\n\nThe solution of the triaxial HWG equation, Eq. 13, does not require to perform a separate\nangular momentum projection in the laboratory system for each component of the GCM\nbasis states in the sense of Eq. 22. However, as in the axial case, we expect the PNAMP\npotential energy surfaces to provide insight and a better interpretation of the configuration\nmixing calculations.

The HWG eigenstates, Eq. 22, provide real eigenstates of the symmetry operators\n\n22\n\n\fthat can be used, as we shall see below, to generate energy spectra and to calculate transition\nprobabilities.\nIn Fig. 8 we plot the normalized PNAMP energy landscapes in the (\u03b2, \u03b3) plane for the\n+\nlowest eigenvalue in the K-space for each angular momentum I = 0+\n1 \u2212 81 (see Eq.23).\n\nIn addition, all the points close to the spherical one, and those close to axiality for odd\nvalues of I, have been removed for I 6= 0 because their norm is very small.

For I = 0+\n1 , 21 the minima are located in (\u03b2 \u223c 0.7, \u03b3 \u223c 10 )\n\nwhile with increasing value of the angular momentum we observe a softening of the PES and\na displacement of the minimum to larger \u03b3 and smaller \u03b2 deformation, (\u03b2 \u223c 0.65, \u03b3 \u223c 15\u25e6 )\n+\n+ + +\n\u25e6\nfor I = 4+\n1 , 51 and (\u03b2 \u223c 0.55, \u03b3 \u223c 17 ) for I = 61 , 71 , 81 . We also note that in the case of\n\nodd-I values the softening of the PES is in the \u03b3 direction towards the oblate saddle point.\nThe energy difference between the VAP-PN and the I = 0+\n1 minima is \u223c 4.6 MeV while\nthe gain in energy due to the inclusion of the triaxial degree of freedom, i.e, the difference\nbetween the triaxial minimum and the axial saddle point, is \u223c 0.7 MeV. Similar results\nhave been reported with Skyrme and Relativistic interactions although these studies of the\nPNAMP-PES only extend to I = 0, 2 and the effect of increasing triaxiality with growing\nangular momentum has not been analyzed.\nFor an interpretation of the configuration mixing calculations it has become customary to\nplot the diagonal matrix elements of the normalized Hamiltonian overlap, see Eq. 14, i.e.,\nthe IK-projected energy\nI;N Z\nEK\n(\u03b2\u03b3)\n\n=\n\nI;N Z\nHK\u03b2\u03b3K\u03b2\u03b3\nI;N Z\nNK\u03b2\u03b3K\u03b2\u03b3\n\n,\n\n(26)\n\nin the (\u03b2, \u03b3) plane for the different K-values. Since the states |IM K; N Z; \u03b2\u03b3i are not\neigenstates of the angular momentum in the laboratory frame their energies do not have a\nphysical meaning. Furthermore the IK-projected energy PES and wave functions depend\non the orientation of the axis in Fig. 3. To illustrate this point we present in Fig. 9 PES's\ncalculated in three approaches for different orientations of the nucleus according to Fig. 3.\nWe observe that, as expected, one sixth of the circle (for instance \u03b3 = 0\u25e6 \u2212 60\u25e6 ) is enough\nto describe the PES corresponding to the VAP-PN and the PNAMP ones (corresponding to\n\n23\n\n\f0\n\nVAP-PN\nVAP\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n120\n\n20\n\n25\n\nMeV\n\n30\n\n60\n\n0\n\nI=2\nJ=2 K=0\nK=0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n120\n\n20\n\n25\n\nJ=0\nI=0\n\n0\n\nI=2\nJ=21\n\n180\n\n1\n\n240\n\n300\n\n120\n\n60\n\n0\n\n240\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n240\n\n300\n\n120\n\n60\n\n0\n-1\n\nJ=222\nI=2\n\n180\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n240\n\n300\n\n120\n\n60\n\n300\n\n!\n\n0\n-1\n\n0\n\n240\n\n1\n\n180\n\n0\n-1\n\n300\n\nFIG. 9: (Color online) Potential energy contour plots for\n\n30\n\n60\n\n!\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n120\n\n180\n\n1\n\n!\n\n-1\n\n5\n\n!\n\n0\n-1\n\nJ=2\nI=2 K=2\n\n180\n\n0\n\n!\n\n0\n-1\n\nMeV\n\n60\n\n!\n\n180\n\n30\n\n240\n\n24 Mg\n\n0\n\n1\n\n300\n\nin the (\u03b2, \u03b3) plane for \u03b3 = 0\u25e6 \u2212\n\n360\u25e6 in different approaches and angular momenta normalized to the corresponding minima.

The values of (\u03b2, \u03b3)min may not coincide exactly with those of Fig. 8 because of the finite size\nof the grid used in the calculations. The quoted values are the actual ones used in the K-mixing\ncalculation. The K = \u00b16, \u00b18 components, not shown, are exactly zero.\n\n\u03b3 = 0\u25e6 . For I = 2, K = 2, the collective AM is parallel to the z-axis and in this case the\nminima will be around \u03b3 = 120\u25e6 and \u03b3 = 240\u25e6 . Specially for the latter case we see that\nit can be dangerous to make interpretations based on the \u03b3 = 0\u25e6 \u2212 60\u25e6 sector. For nuclei\nwith more mixing one should also care about the interpretation of the I = 2, K = 0 surface.\nIn any case, it is important to note that the K value is not a good quantum number in\nthe laboratory frame and therefore it is not an observable. In addition, the distribution\nof K and the corresponding PES can change depending on the orientation of the intrinsic\nwave function (see Fig. 3). Nevertheless, in cases where the K-mixing is not very large this\nquantum number can be useful to give an interpretation of the different bands that could\nappear in the spectrum. As we will see below,\n\n24\n\nMg is a very good example of rather pure\n\n|K| bands. One should be aware, however, that even with rather pure |K| = 2 bands, a\nmixing of K = 2 and K = \u22122 takes place and since these states are not orthonormal pitfalls\nmay appear.\n25\n\n\f24\n\n18\n16\n\nMg\n\n8+\n7+\n\n14\n138\n\n106\n\n39\n\n6+\n\nEx (MeV)\n\n12\n72 124\n4\n\n10\n6+\n\n116\n\n8\n\n4\n\n102\n\n4+\n\n1\n147\n132\n\n6\n\n213\n\n1\n\n5+\n\n70\n\n3+\n2+\n\n10\n\n4+\n164\n\n6\n6\n\n2\n0\n\n2+\n0+\n\n119\n\nFIG. 10: RVAMPIR spectrum and transition probabilities.\n\nAs discussed in Sect. II B, the minima of the PNAMP potential energy surfaces provide an\napproximation to an angular momentum projection in a variation after projection approach,\nwhich we have called RVAMPIR. In Table I we present the (\u03b2, \u03b3) of the minima of the two\nlowest eigenstates together with the K-distribution of the corresponding wave functions.\n+ + + +\nAs we observe there is almost no mixing, the 0+\n1 , 21 , 41 , 61 , 81 states are K = 0 and the\n+ + + +\n2+\n2 , 31 , 42 , 51 , 71 , K = 2. Only at the highest angular momentum we observe very small\n\nK-mixing. This is not the general rule. The amount of K-mixing depends strongly on the\nnucleus and on the (\u03b2, \u03b3) point. As mentioned 24 Mg seems to be a nucleus with rather small\nI\nI\n) provides\nK-mixing.

In Fig.10 we present\nthe energy spectrum and the calculated transition probabilities. Though we will discuss this\nfigure in relation with the full GCM results we can compare with the Axial PNAMP-GCM\nexcitation spectrum of Fig.2. The clear difference is the presence of a well developed gamma\nband in the RVAMPIR calculations.\n\nB.\n\nThe configuration mixing calculations for\n\n24 Mg\n\nThe final step in the calculation of the spectrum is the GCM-PNAMP method, in which\nsimultaneous mixing of the different deformations (\u03b2, \u03b3) and K components is performed\n\n26\n\n\f-185\n2 +3\n2 +2\n2 +1\n\nE (MeV)\n\n-190\n-195\n-200\n\n-205 -6\n10\n10-5 10-4 10-3 10-2 10-1\n!\n\n1\n\nFIG. 11: (Color online) GCM-PNAMP energies (I = 2) as a function of the corresponding norm\neigenvalue, normalized to the highest value, used as cutoff in the definition of the natural basis\n(Eq. 17).\n\n(see Eq. 1). As we mentioned in Sec. II A, we have to solve the HWG equations separately\nfor each value of the angular momentum. These generalized eigenvalue problems are solved\nremoving the linear dependence of the states with the definition of the orthonormal natural\nbasis (Eq. 17). In order to avoid spurious states in this basis, we have to define a cutoff\nparameter, \u03b6, to determine the states in the natural basis, see Eq. 17 and text below. The\nconvergence of the triaxial PNAMP-GCM method is showed in Fig. 11 where the lowest\nthree energy values obtained for I = 2 are represented as a function of the parameter \u03b6.\nHere we distinguish a region of large \u03b6 in which the energies are decreasing followed by a\nrange of values where the energies are nearly constant. The appearance of these plateaus is\nthe signature of the convergence of the GCM method [67]. We observe that this plateau is\n+\n+\nbetter defined for the 2+\n1 and 22 states as compared to the 23 . Finally, for small values of \u03b6\n\nthe linear dependence shows up and we obtain meaningless values for the energy. The final\nchoice for \u03b6 is a value around which we observe a wide plateau for all the levels of interest.\nThis value must be kept constant for a given angular momentum in order to guarantee the\northogonality of the corresponding wave functions. This analysis has been performed for\ndifferent values of the angular momentum showing in all cases a behavior similar to the one\npresented in Fig. 11. Eventually, we have chosen \u03b6 = 10\u22123 as the final value, similar to the\none found in Ref. [49]. This procedure can be complemented by an inspection of the shape\nof the collective wave function as a function of \u03b6.\nIn the central panel of Fig. 12 we now plot the spectrum of\n27\n\n24\n\nMg extracted from the\n\n\f18\n16\n\n8+\n4+\n\n0+\n58\n\n14\n\n8+\n\n8\n\n2+\n164\n\nEx (MeV)\n\n6\n\n2+\n\n118\n\n50\n\n2\n\n44\n\n+\n\n81\n\n6+\n\n0+\n\n40\n\nMg\n\n70\n\n162\n\n12\n\n24\n\n4+\n\n7+\n\n109\n\n0+\n\n14\n71 115\n\n10\n\n0\n\n5+\n\n6+\n\n8\n\n6\n\n1\n\n97\n\n+\n\n19\n\n6\n4\n\n2\n\n10\n\n142\n\n+\n\n199\n\n65\n\n6\n\n0+\n\n0+\n\n1\n\n6+\n\n2\n\n140\n\n+ 2\n\n155\n64\n\n9\n\n160\n\n2\n105\n\nTriaxial\n\n239\n\n4+\n3+\n\n2+\n0+\n7\n\n2+\n\n10 15\n8\n\n+\n\n0+\n\nAxial\n\n5\n\n4+\n9\n\n4+\n\n5+\n\n3+\n\n2+\n\n105\n\n0\n\n10\n\n+\n\n15\n\n4+\n145\n\n2\n\n143\n\n4+\n\n4\n\n1\n144\n\n150\n\n2\n\n100\n\n88\n\nExperiment\n\nFIG. 12: Calculated excitation energies and reduced transition probabilities B(E2) (in e2 f m4 )\nin\n\n24 Mg\n\nobtained using axially symmetric (left) and triaxial (middle) GCM-PNAMP approaches\n\ncompared to the experimental values (right). The widths of the arrows are proportional to the\ncorresponding B values . The experimental values are taken from [68]\n\ntriaxial GCM calculations. We classify the different levels in three bands according to the\ncorresponding B(E2) values. The ground state band is formed by a sequence of even angular\nmomentum states with a level spacing very similar to that of a rotational band. The first\nexcited band consists of states with I = 2, 3, 4, 5, ... as expected for a \u03b3 band. The third band\nis built of even-I states on top of the second 0+\n2 state. We can also compare the absolute\nvalue of the ground state energy calculated with different approaches. Evidently, the lowest\nvalue is obtained with the triaxial GCM-PNAMP method (-201.36 MeV) while -200.74 MeV\nand -200.67 MeV are the results for RVAMPIR and axial GCM-PNAMP approximations\nrespectively. Comparing the first two values we observe that the energy gained by mixing\ndifferent shapes is \u22480.5 MeV, much less than the correlation provided by PN and/or AM\nrestoration. On the other hand, the inclusion of the triaxial degree of freedom within the\nGCM framework gives a similar energy gain (\u22480.5 MeV) due to the fact that the ground\nstate -and also the whole band built on top of it- is already well described by an axial\ncalculation in this particular nucleus. Major changes, as we will see below, are however\nfound for the excited bands. Concerning the transition probabilities, we observe strong electric quadrupole intraband transitions while the interband E2 transitions are much weaker.\n28\n\n\fI\u03c3+ E(MeV) K = 0 K = \u00b12 K = \u00b14 K = \u00b16 K = \u00b18\n0+\n1\n\n0.000\n\n1.000\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n2+\n1\n\n1.202\n\n0.922\n\n0.039\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n4+\n1\n\n3.875\n\n0.904\n\n0.016\n\n0.032\n\n-\n\n-\n\n6+\n1\n\n8.256\n\n0.882\n\n0.011\n\n0.015\n\n0.033\n\n-\n\n8+\n1 15.198 0.834\n\n0.040\n\n0.017\n\n0.016\n\n0.010\n\n2+\n2\n\n5.616\n\n0.188\n\n0.406\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n3+\n1\n\n6.564\n\n0.000\n\n0.500\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n4+\n2\n\n7.990\n\n0.081\n\n0.413\n\n0.046\n\n-\n\n-\n\n5+\n1\n\n9.718\n\n0.000\n\n0.407\n\n0.093\n\n-\n\n-\n\n6+\n2 11.688\n\n0.078\n\n0.398\n\n0.007\n\n0.056\n\n-\n\n7+\n1 14.349\n\n0.000\n\n0.379\n\n0.036\n\n0.085\n\n-\n\n0+\n2 11.265 1.000\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n2+\n3 12.686 0.958\n\n0.021\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n4+\n3 14.363 0.795\n\n0.048\n\n0.055\n\n-\n\n-\n\nTABLE II: Decomposition of the norm of GCM-PNAMP collective wave functions into K compoP\n\nnents (\n\n\u03b2,\u03b3\n\nI;N Z;\u03c3\n(\u03b2, \u03b3)|2 ) for the first, second and third bands. The highest values are printed\n|FK\n\nin boldface. The excitation energies of the corresponding states are also provided.\n\nThis fact indicates different underlying structures of the bands and the absence of mixing\nbetween them. We can study the nature of these bands decomposing the collective wave\nfunctions |F I;N Z;\u03c3 (\u03b2, \u03b3)|2 (Eq. 19) into their K components, |FKI;N Z;\u03c3 (\u03b2, \u03b3)|2 , summing the\ncontribution of all deformations (\u03b2, \u03b3) for each K. The result is shown in Table II , where\nwe clearly observe that the first and third bands are rather pure K = 0 while the second\nband corresponds mainly to |K| = 2 states. Furthermore, we see that for each level the \u00b1K\ncomponents have the same values, as a direct consequence of the time-reversal conservation\nof the intrinsic wave functions.\nThe distribution of the states within these bands is supported by the values of the spectro-\n\n29\n\n\f1.5\n\nQ(I)/Q(2)\n\n1\n0.5\n1st\n2nd\n3rd\nK=0\nK=2\n\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n-1.5\n0\n\n2\n\n4_\nIh\n\n6\n\n8\n\nFIG. 13: (Color online) Spectroscopic quadrupole moments as a function of the angular momentum\nI calculated for the states in the first (black bullets), second (blue diamonds) and third (magenta\ntriangles) bands and for the vibrational-rotational collective model with K = 0 (red boxes) and\nK = 2 (black circles).\n\nscopic quadrupole moments:\ns\n\nQ(I\u03c3) =\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n16\u03c0 \uf8ec I I I \uf8f7\nelec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8 hI; N Z\u03c3||M\u03022 ||I; N Z\u03c3i\n5\nI 0 \u2212I\n\n(27)\n\nelec\n= er2 Y2\u03bc (\u03b8, \u03c6) are the electrical quadrupole moment operators.

In Fig. 13 we compare\nthe triaxial results with the values given for the collective rotational model with K = 0\nand K = 2 -normalized to I = 2. Here we can clearly observe that the ground state band\ncorresponds to a rotational band (K = 0) while the second band matches to a \u03b3-band\n(K = 2) and the third band cannot be described in this simple picture.\nWe also plot the probability distribution |F I;N Z;\u03c3 (\u03b2, \u03b3)|2 of each GCM state in the (\u03b2, \u03b3)\nsurface (Fig. 14) summing all the possible K components. The most noticeable aspect is\nthat all the states belonging to the same band have a very similar probability distribution in\n30\n\n\fthe (\u03b2, \u03b3) plane and that the overlap between states of different bands is small. One could\nassume that these facts will lead to the intraband and interband B(E2) values shown in Fig.\n12. However, as we shall see below, the reason for the small interband transitions seems to\nbe more related to a K-hindrance aspect based on the fact that the ground band is a pure\nK = 0 and the \u03b3-band a rather pure |K| = 2 band. In particular, all the states in the first\nband have a well defined maximum at (\u03b2 \u223c 0.58, \u03b3 = 0\u25e6 ) and the probability drops rather\nsymmetrically in the \u03b2 and \u03b3 directions. For the second band, the probability distribution\nis concentrated in a region of the plane with (\u03b2 \u2208 [0.4 \u2212 1.0], \u03b3 \u2208 [0\u25e6 , 35\u25e6 ]) with maxima\naround (\u03b2 \u223c 0.7, \u03b3 \u223c 18\u25e6 ). Finally, the states belonging to the third band show a high\n+ + +\nprobability of having spherical shape (0+\n2 ) or slightly prolate (23 , 43 , 63 ) combined with a\n\nnon-negligible mixing of strongly deformed states in the range of \u03b2 \u2208 [0.8, 1.3], \u03b3 \u2208 [0\u25e6 , 30\u25e6 ].\nThe PNAMP-PES of Fig. 8 can help to understand the probability distribution of the HWG\n+ + + +\nequation. Looking at the ground band panels (0+\n1 , 21 , 41 , 61 , 81 ) of Fig. 8 we find that all\n\nshow soft triaxial minima close to the axial axis, the contour lines being elongated along the\nradial direction and rather steep along the \u03b3 angle. These states will mix with the mirrored\nones at \u03b3 = 0\u25e6 , see Fig. 9, and as a result distributions with a peak at \u03b3 = 0\u25e6 similar to\nthe ones in the left panels of Fig. 14 are expected. If we now concentrate on the panels\n+ +\n(3+\n1 , 51 , 71 ), representative of the \u03b3 band, we observe contour lines centered around a soft\n\nslightly triaxial minimum. These contours, at variance with the ones of the ground band,\nare softer in the \u03b3 angle. We found that the members of the \u03b3 band are rather pure K = 2\nstates, that means, the norms of the states along the symmetry axis (\u03b3 = 0) are zero. This\naxis acts as a barrier between the states above \u03b3 = 0\u25e6 and the mirrored ones hindering the\nmechanism described for the ground band. As a result distributions similar to the ones in\nthe middle panels of Fig. 14 will be obtained.\nIn Fig. 12 we have also compared the triaxial results with axial calculations. In order\nto better understand the results of this comparison, we investigate first the relationship\nbetween the axial and triaxial collective wave functions. The axial states emerge from the\n\u03b3 = 0\u25e6 \u2212180\u25e6 path of the K = 0 component of the corresponding triaxial states. In particular,\n+ +\nwe can relate the ground state bands in both approaches and also the axial 0+\n2 , 23 , 42 with\n+ +\nthe triaxial 0+\n2 , 23 , 43 states (see Figs. 1 and 14). Hence, the comparison between the triaxial\n\nand axial calculations reveals that both the energies and reduced transition probabilities of\nthe ground state band are very similar in both cases, as expected.

Contour lines are separated in\n0.01 units.\n\nmixing for I 6= 0 lowers the excitation energies of higher angular momentum and therefore,\nthe triaxial ground state band is slightly compressed with respect to the axial band. This\neffect, although small, helps to improve the description of the moments of inertia within the\nGCM-PNAMP framework. Larger differences between the axial and triaxial calculations\nappear for the second and third bands. Obviously, the axial calculations are unable to\ndescribe the \u03b3-band but also the energies and B(E2) for the third triaxial band (K = 0\nmainly) are modified with respect to the corresponding ones in the axial case. This difference\nis due to both the small K-mixing and the triaxial configuration around \u03b2 \u223c 1.0 that appears\nalready for I = 0 (see Fig. 14).\nIn Table III we present the average intrinsic deformation parameters and the spectroscopic\nquadrupole moments obtained for the axial and triaxial calculations. In general the average\n\u03b2 deformation is larger in the triaxial than in the axial calculations. The largest differences\ncorrespond, obviously, to the states that compose the \u03b3 band in the triaxial case and to the\n\n32\n\n\f0+\n2 state due to the fake minimum on the oblate side of Fig. 1. Also interesting to notice\nis that though the most probable \u03b3-value in the first band is zero, the average \u03b3 values are\naround 15\u25e6 . Also the average \u03b3 values for the \u03b3-band are larger than the most probable\nones. For completeness we also include the values of the spectroscopic quadrupole moments.\nAt this point we would like to discuss the bands obtained in the RVAMPIR approach and\nplotted in Fig. 10. At first glance both bands look similar to the corresponding ones of the\nfull GCM calculations. A more careful analysis shows that the GCM bands are slightly more\ncompressed than the RVAMPIR ones in a better agreement with the experimental results.\nThe transition probabilities are also very similar in both approaches. It is really surprising\nthat the RVAMPIR is able to provide spectra and transition probabilities comparable to\nthe full GCM approach. There are several reasons which explain this behavior. A look to\nFig. 14 shows that all states of the first and second band, respectively, do have a similar\nprobability distribution consisting of one maximum -practically at the same (\u03b2, \u03b3) point\nfor all I-values- and a homogeneous spread around this point. Such distributions can be\nvery well approximated by a delta function at the given point. Furthermore since there is\nno K-mixing neither in the GCM nor in the RVAMPIR there is no chance that the two\napproaches can differ in this respect. The maxima of band 2 are located practically at the\nsame (\u03b2, \u03b3) point in both approaches while for band 1 the GCM maximum appears closer to\nthe symmetry axis. However since the surfaces are rather flat around these points this does\nnot matter too much. With respect to the B(E2) transition probabilities we observe that\nthey are rather similar to the ones of the GCM calculations, i.e., they are large for intraband\n+\n+\nand small for interband transitions. Interestingly the 2+\n1 , the 22 and the 31 RVAMPIR states\n\ndo have the same deformation parameters, see Table I, i.e., we cannot argue, as in the GCM\ncase, that the small interband transition probabilities are due to the poor overlap of the\ncorresponding wave functions. The reason is that the ground band is a pure K = 0 and\nthe \u03b3-band a pure |K| = 2 band. As a matter of fact, in this case, if we look at Eq. 21,\nwe observe that if the factors sandwiched between the collective wave functions do not mix\nstrongly the K quantum number, then the transition probabilities are very small.\nFinally we compare the triaxial results with the available experimental data for\n\n24\n\nMg\n\n(see Fig. 12). We find a remarkable qualitative agreement between theory and experiment\nboth in energies and reduced transition probabilities. In both cases we observe a rotational\nground state band, a second band associated to a \u03b3-band and a third band with \u2206I = 2. In\n33\n\n\ffact, the theoretical description of the experimentally observed \u03b3-band is one of the major\nachievements of the present model compared to previous implementations. Furthermore,\nin the particular case of\n\n24\n\nMg, the excitation energies within the ground band are very\n\nwell described even quantitatively with the present calculations as we see in Fig. 12. In\naddition, it is important to emphasize the quality of the theoretical results for the intraband\nand interband reduced transition probabilities which reflect the small K mixing between the\ncorresponding bands. Although the improvement of the results with respect to the axial case\nis evident, the band heads of the \u03b3- and, especially, the third band are still calculated too high\nin excitation energy. This is probably due to the lack of the correlations associated to the\nangular momentum restoration before the variation and time-reversal symmetry breaking\nthat are not included in this calculation. Additionally, the inclusion of two-quasiparticle\nstates would further lower the excitation energies for these band heads. These effects could\nalso be present in the ground state bands. However, all these potential improvements are\nbeyond the scope of the present work. They would probably lead to a better quantitative\ndescription of the experimental results although we do not expect qualitative changes in the\ngeneral picture. Research in this direction is in progress.\n\nVI.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn summary, we have presented the first implementation of the GCM-PNAMP method\nwith fully triaxial intrinsic wave functions found by solving the VAP-PN equations with the\nGogny interaction. Furthermore, due to the huge computational effort demanded by this\ntype of calculations, we have established a protocol for a good performance of the method,\nnamely:\n1. Perform first a GCM-PNAMP with only axial K = 0 wave functions in order to choose\nthe number of oscillator shells, the relevant interval of \u03b2 deformation and the density\nof points in the collective variable.\n2. Study the convergence of the triaxial angular momentum projection with the number\nof integration points in the Euler angles by looking at the expectation value of I\u02c62 in\nthe (\u03b2, \u03b3) plane and exploit the symmetries of the intrinsic states.\n34\n\n\fI \u03c3 \u03b2\u0304tr\n\n\u25e6\n\u03b3\u0304tr\n\n\u25e6 Qspec\nQspec\n\u03b2\u0304ax \u03b3ax\nax\ntr\n\n0 1 0.644 14.81 0.00 0.510 0\n\n0.00\n\n0 2 0.515 25.98 0.00 0.221 0\n\n0.00\n\n2 1 0.658 13.58 -20.80 0.606 0 -19.94\n2 2 0.709 23.16 21.59 0.346 60 12.70\n2 3 0.642 16.02 -19.66 0.451 0 -19.33\n3 1 0.717 22.05 -0.18\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n4 1 0.661 13.65 -26.33 0.623 0 -25.04\n4 2 0.714 22.60 -10.96 0.495 0 -20.33\n4 3 0.541 19.95 -18.51\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n5 1 0.720 22.67 -17.51\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n6 1 0.657 14.51 -28.42 0.622 0 -26.52\n6 2 0.702 22.92 -20.97\n\n-\n\n- -18.08\n\n6 3 0.535 17.24 -23.16\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n7 1 0.730 24.07 -24.49\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n8 1 0.701 15.36 -25.96 0.648 0 -28.18\nTABLE III: Average intrinsic deformation parameters and spectroscopic quadrupole moments (in\ne fm) in the triaxial and axial approximations.\n\n3. Choose a triangular mesh in the (\u03b2, \u03b3) plane in order to avoid both redundancy near\nthe spherical shape and spurious effects due to a loss of resolution for increasing \u03b2.\n4. Select the converged states as the ones whose energy belongs to a plateau and ensure\nthe orthogonality with the other states with the same angular momentum.\n5. Check the convergence of the results in the full triaxial calculation.\nThe method has been applied to the study of\n\n24\n\nMg which has been chosen as a test case\n\nin previous studies with different interactions. The comparison between axial and triaxial\nresults shows minor changes in the ground state band which is predicted to be an axial\nrotational band with K = 0. Only for angular momentum I \u2265 4 some K-mixing is observed\ngiving rise to a small level compression. This result supports the use of axial calculations\n\n35\n\n\fin these cases. However, the triaxial calculation is also able to reproduce the second band\nassociated to a \u03b3-band (K = 2) observed experimentally.\nWe have also introduced the RVAMPIR method which provides a more affordable alternative to the full GCM procedure for the calculation of ground and \u03b3 bands. We find\nthat this approach provides a good description of the energy levels and the intraband and\ninterband transition probabilities for the nucleus\n\n24\n\nMg.\n\nFurthermore, the agreement between the theoretical and experimental results is in general\ngood although some improvements beyond the scope of this work must be performed in\norder to give a better quantitative description. Some work is in progress in order to take\ninto account these effects. In any case,\n\n24\n\nMg is not a very good example for studying strong\n\ntriaxial effects like the ones mentioned in the introduction and the method will be applied\nin the near future to other systems where both triaxiality and K-mixing play a crucial role\nin describing the experimental data.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors acknowledge financial support from the Spanish Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n\ny Ciencia under contracts FPA2007-66069 and FPA2009-13377-C02-01, by the Spanish\nConsolider-Ingenio 2010 Programme CPAN (CSD2007-00042) and within the Programa de\nAyudas para Estancias de Movilidad Posdoctoral 2008 (T.R.R).\n\n[1] M.
