It is known that macroscopic properties of ferroelectrics strongly depend on domain walls, which are extended two-dimensional defects.\nAny fundamental understanding of ferroelectricity in perovskites requires a detailed understanding of domain walls\nin the nanoscale (see [2] and references therein). Theoretical studies of domain walls have revealed many of their\ninteresting features. From both theoretical calculations\nand experimental works, it has been observed that the\nthickness of domain walls can vary from thin walls, which\nconsist of only a few atomic spaces to thick walls, which\nare in the order of a few micrometers. There have been\nstudies using ab inito calculations [3\u20135] and anaharmonic\nlattice statics calculations [6] suggesting that ferroelectric\ndomain walls are atomically sharp. Hlinka and Marton\n[7] analyzed 90\u25e6 domain walls in BaTiO3 -like crystals in\nthe framework of the phenomenological Ginzburg-LandauDevonshire (GLD) model and obtained domain wall thickness of 3.6 nm at room temperature. Chrosch and Salje\n[8] measured the domain wall thickness in LaAlO3 in the\ntemperature range 295 \u2212 900 K by x-ray diffraction. They\nobserved that domain wall thickness increases from about\n20 \u00c5 to 200 \u00c5 and that the variation of domain wall thickness with temperature is linear at low temperatures. Using\nscanning probe microscopy, Iwata et al [9] found complex\n180\u25e6 domain walls with thicknesses 1 \u2212 2 \u03bcm in PZN20%PT. Lehnen et al [10] investigated 180\u25e6 domain walls\n\nin PbTiO3 using electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) and\npiezoelectric force microscopy (PFM) and observed thick\n180\u25e6 domain walls at room temperature with thickness of\nabout 5 \u03bcm. Shilo et al [11] studied the structure of 90\u25e6\ndomain walls in PbTiO3 by measuring the surface profile close to emerging domain walls and then fitting it\nto the soliton-type solution of GLD theory. Using this\ntechnique they observed that the domain wall thickness is\nabout 1.5 nm but with a wide scatter. They suggested\nthat the presence of point defects within the domain wall\nis responsible for such variations. Lee et al [12] provided\na model to investigate the effect of point defects on the\ndomain wall thickness. See also [13] for a similar study.\nDomain walls have been studied using different techniques in the atomic scale at T = 0K. However, one\nwould be interested to know how different the structure\nand thickness of a 180\u25e6 domain wall at room temperature\nare compared to those at T = 0K. In this letter, we study\nthe structure of Pb and Ti-centered 180\u25e6 domain walls in\nPbTiO3 as a function of temperature in some detail. We\nfirst start with the static configuration of domain walls\nand iteratively optimize the free energy for a small temperature, e.g. T1 = 5K. The optimized structure at T1\nwill be the reference configuration for a higher temperature T2 = T1 + \u2206T . Continuing in this way we optimize\nthe structure of the domain wall up to T = 300K. This\ntemperature range is where quantum effects are important and hence molecular dynamics simulations can not\nbe used. This is also the temperature range where quasiharmonic approximation is reasonable.\n\np-1\n\n\fArzhang Angoshtari1 Arash Yavari 1\n\nFig. 1: Reference configuration of a Ti-centered 180\u25e6 domain wall shown in both the TiO2 and PbO planes. Note that cores\nand shells on the domain wall have no relative shifts and cores and shells on the left and right sides of the wall have opposite\nrelative shifts.\n\nMethod of Calculation. \u2013 The geometry of a Ticentered 180\u25e6 domain wall is shown in Fig. 1. The domain wall is in a (100)-plane and the polarization vector\nis in the y-direction and changes by 180 degrees across\nthe domain wall. In this geometry, depending on which\ncations are placed on the domain wall, two types of domain walls are possible: Pb-centered and Ti-centered. In\nthis work, we consider both types and calculate their finite temperature structures. For our calculations, we use\nthe shell potential developed by Asthagiri et al [14] for\nPbTiO3 . In this potential, each ion is described by a core\nand a massless shell. The short range interactions between Pb-O, Ti-O and O-O shells are described by the\nRydberg potential Vsr (r) = (A + Br) exp(\u2212r/C), where\nA, B and C are potential parameters. The cores and\nshells of each ion have Coulombic interactions with cores\nand shells of all the other ions. The core and shell of\nan atom interact by an anharmonic spring of the form\nVcs (r) = (1/2)k2 r2 + (1/24)k4 r4 , where k2 and k4 are constants.\nThe structure of a domain wall is calculated by an analytical free energy optimization method. This method was\ndeveloped by Kantorovich [15] and has been applied to various different systems, e.g. in [16\u201318]. We refer the reader\nto these references for the complete details of the method.\nA domain wall is an example of a defective lattice with a\n1-D symmetry reduction [19, 20]. Here we briefly explain\nthe free energy optimization method exploiting symmetry\nreduction. For more details see [21].\nThe multi-lattice of PbTiO3 can be partitioned into the\n\nunion of some 2-D equivalence classes that are parallel\nto the domain wall. Therefore, we reduce the dimension of\nF the\nF problem from three to one, i.e., we can write\nL = I \u03b1\u2208Z LI\u03b1 , where L, LI\u03b1 , and Z are the lattice,\n2-D equivalence classes, and the set of integers, respectively. Note that j = J\u03b2 means that the atom j is in the\n\u03b2th equivalence class of the Jth sublattice [19]. As an approximation similar to that of [22], we assume only a finite\nnumber of neighboring equivalence classes, N , on each side\nof the domain wall and assume the temperature-dependent\nbulk configuration outside this region. Therefore, the size\nof the effective dynamical matrix would be 15 \u00d7 2N . To\nobtain the lattice structure around the domain wall at a\nfinite temperature, we minimize the Helmholtz free energy\nF , calculated based on the quasi-harmonic\napproximation\n\b\nwith respect to the configuration Xj j\u2208L at a finite temperature T . Note that away from the domain wall the two\nhalf lattices approach their temperature-dependent configurations. We can write the\n\u0001 free energy of the defective\nlattice F \u2261 F {Xj }j\u2208L , T , as\n\u0001\nF = E {Xj }j\u2208L\n\u0013\u0015\u001b\n\u0014\n\u0012\nX X\u001a 1\nh\u0304\u03c9i (k)\n+\n,\nh\u0304\u03c9i (k)+kB T ln 1 \u2212 exp \u2212\n2\nkB T\ni\nk\n\n(1)\nwhere E is the total static energy of the lattice and \u03c9(k)\nis the frequency at wave number k \u2208 B with B the first\nBrillouin zone of the sublattices. Note that for calculating\n\np-2\n\n\fFinite-Temperature Atomic Structure of 180\u25e6 Ferroelectric Domain Walls in PbTiO3\n\nFig. 2: The y-coordinates of Pb and Ti cores in the Pb-centered 180\u25e6 domain wall as a function of temperature. LS denotes\nthe lattice statics solution.\n\nFig. 3: The y-coordinates of Pb and Ti cores in the Ti-centered 180\u25e6 domain wall as a function of temperature. LS denotes the\nlattice statics solution.\n\nthe derivatives of the frequencies, we exploit the analytical\nmethod of Kantorovich [15].\nFor optimization of the free energy, we use the quasiNewton method with the Broyden-Fletcher-GoldfurbShanno update for calculating the approximate inverse\nHessian in each step [23]. We should mention that to converge to the optimized configuration, one should select an\ninitial configuration close to the solution. Thus, for calculating a finite temperature configuration, we start with\na nominal configuration (see Fig. 1), which is obtained\nby relaxing the bulk at temperature T = 0K, and then\nusing this bulk configuration with opposite directions of\ncore-shell shifts on the two sides of the 180\u25e6 domain wall.\nThen, we relax the nominal configuration and obtain the\nlattice statics solution. Next, using the lattice statics solution, we obtain the lattice configuration at zero temperature and then we use temperature steps of \u2206T = 25K,\nand obtain the optimized configuration at a given finite\ntemperature. This way we observe that the quasi-Newton\nmethod converges relatively fast. Assuming force tolerance of 0.05 eV/\u00c5, our solutions converged after about\n\n20 to 40 iterations depending on the temperature. Note\nthat we only assume periodicity of unit cells in the y- and\nz-directions. In the x-direction we assume N unit cells\nin each side of the domain wall and use the temperaturedependent bulk configurations as the far field boundary\nconditions. Our numerical experiments show that N = 12\nwould be enough to capture the atomic structure near the\ndomain walls up to T = 300K as we do not see changes in\nthe structure by choosing larger N . In our calculations,\nwe used a 1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 k -point Monkhorst-Pack mesh [24].\nAlso for calculating the classical Coulombic potential and\nforce, we used the damped Wolf method [25].\nNumerical Results for 180\u25e6 Domain Walls. \u2013 Because displacements of core and shell of the same atom\nare close, we only report the core displacements. Figure\n2 shows the y-coordinates (tetragonal coordinates) of the\nPb and Ti cores relative to a Pb core on the Pb-centered\ndomain wall. Figure 3 shows the y-coordinates of the Pb\nand Ti cores relative to a Ti core on the Ti-centered domain wall. In these figures \u0233 = y \u2212 (c/2), where c is the\n\np-3\n\n\fArzhang Angoshtari1 and Arash Yavari 1\n\n\u22125.760\n\n\u22125.765\n\n\u22125.770\n\n2\n\nF\u0304 (eV/\u00c5 )\n\ntemperature-dependent lattice parameter in the tetragonal direction. The lattice parameters change with temperature such that by increasing temperature, unit cells\ntransform from tetragonal to cubic [26]. Here to calculate\nlattice parameters at a finite temperature, we separately\noptimized the bulk lattice at that temperature. Note that\nfar from the domain wall, each half lattice approaches its\ncorresponding temperature-dependent bulk configuration.\nIn these figures, LS denotes the lattice statics solution\n(static energy minimization). We observe that the lattice statics solution and the configuration obtained by the\nfree energy minimization at zero temperature although\npredicting nearly the same domain wall thicknesses, are\ndifferent due to the zero-point motions; the lattice statics method ignores the quantum effects. It is known that\nzero-point motions can have significant effects in some systems [27]. Here we observe that zero-point motions affect\nthe Ti-centered domain wall more than the Pb-centered\ndomain wall; zero-point motions change the lattice statics\nsolutions by about 15% in the Pb-centered domain wall\nand by about 50% in the Ti-centered domain wall. Since\nthe atomic displacements normal to the domain wall are\nsmall (they are of order 10\u22122 \u00c5) we do not report them\nhere. However, we will comment on them in the sequel.\nIncreasing the temperature from 0 to 300K, we observe\nthat the domain wall thickness increases from 1nm to\nabout 3nm. This qualitatively agrees with experimental\nobservations for 90\u25e6 domain walls in PbTiO3 by Foeth\net al [29] and domain walls in LaAlO3 by Chrosch and\nSalje [8] who observed that domain wall thickness increases\nwith temperature. They measured an average domain wall\nthickness from room temperature up to the Curie temperature. It is worth mentioning that from Ginzburg-LandauDevonshire theory, domain wall thickness is proportional\nto |T \u2212 Tc|\u22121 [8], where Tc is the Curie temperature. This\nmeans that for low temperatures domain wall thickness is\nlinear in temperature. We observe this linear behavior in\nour numerical simulations. We should also mention that\na similar trend was observed in a lattice of dipoles [21].\nNote also that domain wall thickness cannot be defined\nuniquely very much like boundary layer thickness in fluid\nmechanics. Here, domain wall thickness is by definition\nthe region that is affected by the domain wall, i.e. those\nlayers of atoms that are distorted. One can use definitions\nlike the 99%-thickness in fluid mechanics and define the\ndomain wall thickness as the length of the region that\nhas 99% of the far field rigid translation displacement.\nWhat is important is that no matter what definition is\nchosen, domain wall \"thickness\" increases by increasing\ntemperature.\nRecently, it has been observed that there may be local\nnormal and transverse polarizations near domain walls.\nFor example, Goncalves-Ferreira et al [30] observed local\npolarizations near domain wall of CaTiO3 (nonpolar material) parallel and perpendicular to the wall plane. In our\nsimulations, for both Pb and Ti-centered domain walls we\nobserve that polarization in c-direction switches within a\n\n\u22125.775\n\n\u22125.780\n\nPb-centered\nTi-centered\n\n\u22125.785\n\n\u22125.790\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nT (K)\nFig. 4: Free energy of the domain walls as a function of temperature.\n\nfew lattice spacings in the vicinity of the domain wall and\nthe polarization normal to the domain wall is about 2%\nof the polarization in the c-direction. In particular, we\nsee that normal displacements are 5.0% and 8.0% of their\ncorresponding c-displacements in the Pb and Ti-centered\ndomain walls, respectively. This agrees with the results of\nLee, et al. [28] who observed non-zero displacements normal to the domain wall. In their calculations, polarization\nnormal to the domain wall in the Pb and Ti-centered 180\u25e6\ndomain walls are 2.5% and 1.75%, respectively, of the bulk\npolarization.\nIn Fig. 4, we have plotted the free energy per unit\ncell, F\u0304 = F/(N \u00d7 a \u00d7 c), where N is the number of relaxed unit cells and a and c are temperature-dependent\nlattice parameters, for the two types of domain walls. In\nagreement with Meyer and Vanderbilt [3], we observe that\nTi-centered domain walls have a higher static energy, however we see that they have a lower free energy and hence\nare the preferred domain wall configuration at finite temperatures.\nConcluding Remarks. \u2013 In this work we obtained\nthe finite-temperature structure of Pb and Ti-centered\n180\u25e6 domain walls in PbTiO3 using a quasi-harmonic lattice dynamics method. Our numerical results are in good\nagreement with experimental measurements. We observed\na strong dependence of structure on temperature. In particular, 180\u25e6 domain walls at T = 300K are three times\nthicker than those at T = 0K. We also observed that free\nenergy is a decreasing function of temperature and free\nenergy of a Ti-centered domain wall is always lower than\nthat of a Pb-centered domain wall and hence Ti-centered\ndomain walls are more likely to be seen at finite temperatures.\n\np-4\n\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\nWe thank an anonymous referee for useful comments.\n\n\fFinite-Temperature Atomic Structure of 180\u25e6 Ferroelectric Domain Walls in PbTiO3\n097602.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] Bhattacharya K. and Ravichandran G., Acta Mater.,\n51 (2003) 5941.\n[2] Dawber M., Rabe K.M. and Scott J.F., Rev. of Modern\nPhys., 77 (2005) 1083.\n[3] Meyer B. and Vanderbilt D., Phys.
