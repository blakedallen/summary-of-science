One of the most important\nprogress has been made with the experimental observation of the Mott insulator transition from the superfluid phase of interacting bosonic atoms in optical lattices with a harmonic trapping potential[2]. The bosonic\nMott insulator mimics the conventional Mott insulator with electron correlations, which has been challenging condensed matter physicists for several decades. It\nwas shown theoretically that bosons are uniformly distributed and the Mott insulator transition occurs only\nat sufficiently strong interactions[7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In\nexperiments[2, 12, 13], when a trapping potential is introduced to confine ultracold atoms, a shell structure for\nthe local density shows up with a phase separation of\nMott insulating and superfluid atoms[14].\nExperimentally, the Mott insulating state is exhibited\nby the vanishing of the interference pattern and the appearance of resonances in the excitation spectrum. The\nMott transition occurs when the visibility of interference pattern and its derivatives changes sharply with respect to the lattice depth. The larger quantum fluctuations in one dimension (1D) than those in 3D are shown\nfrom the Bragg spectroscopy[15]. Most recently, the microwave spectroscopy with atomic clock shifts which precisely measures the fluctuation of the atomic number\nat each site allows to identify the superfluid layers between the Mott shells[14], while the formation of a distinct shell structure and its incompressibility are shown\nfor the in-trap density distribution by spatial selective\nmicrowave transitions and spin flip collisions. Numerical simulations, while verifying the shell structure of the\nlocal density[16], show additionally a kink structure of\nthe visibility[17]. All these findings raise an interesting\n\nissue whether and how the critical behavior of the Mott\ntransition of the homogenous case is affected by the trapping potential. It seems that the single critical point for\nthe homogenous case is expanded into an intermediate\nregime owing to the trapping potential. In this regime,\nwe will show that those bosons in the central superfluid\nregion are compressed one by one into the Mott insulating\nplateau with increasing the interaction such that a series\nof successive quantum transitions take place due to the\ninterplay of the trapping potential with the competition\nbetween the kinetic energy and interaction.\nIn this study, we focus on exploring the nature of the\nintermediate states between the perfect superfluid and\nMott insulating states. For this purpose, we investigate\nthe one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with a harmonic trapping potential, which can be realized properly\nby interacting bosons trapped in an optical lattice with\none dominant recoil energy in experiments. The Hamiltonian can be generally written as[7, 8]\n\u0011 UX\nn\u0302i (n\u0302i \u2212 1)\n\u00e2\u2020i \u00e2i+1 + \u00e2\u2020i+1 \u00e2i +\n2 i\ni\nX\nn\u0302i [i \u2212 (L + 1)/2]2\n(1)\n+VT\n\n\u0124 = \u2212t\n\nX\u0010\n\ni\n\nwhere the lattice spacing has been set to one, t a hopping integral set as the energy unit, VT the strength of the\ntrapping potential with a center at xc = (L + 1)/2, and\nU the on-site interaction. Here we employ density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method[18, 19, 20]\nwhich has proved very successful for studying several\nkinds of physical properties in quasi-1D strongly correlated systems. For the present system, we modify the\nfinite-size algorithm in order to obtain a given accuracy\nfor low-lying energy states and recover the spatial inversion symmetry with the trapping potential under open\nboundary conditions. The sweeping is conducted from\n\n\f2\nthe middle to the two ends gradually rather than immediately and the convergence is reached for each sweeping\nlength l \u2208 [4, L] and three lowest eigenstates are targeted\nsimultaneously. Accuracies were examined for different\nsizes L, bare states per site ns , the number of states kept\nin the blocks m, and the total number of bosons N and\nU . We found that ns = 8 and m = 100 are sufficiently\nlarge for U \u2208 [4, 14], whereas ns = 32 and m = 400\nare necessary for U < 4 so that systematic errors due\nto truncations could be smaller than the symbol size (see\nbelow). While systematical studies were made for several\nproperties with N \u2208 [20, 70], novel effects in a crossover\nregime explicitly show up when N >\n\u223c 50 at VT = 0.01. In\nthe following, our discussions focus on results for N = 60\nwith VT = 0.01, for which L = 80 is long enough to\nremove the boundary effects.\nLet us first discuss the low energy properties. For the\nhomogenous case, it is well-known that the Mott transition from the superfluid phase takes place at Uc =\n3.61 \u00b1 0.13[9] and a gap opens monotonically with respect to U in the Mott insulator phase. Fig. 1 shows\ngaps \u22061,2 = E1,2 \u2212 E0 for the two lowest excitations at\nVT = 0.01 with E0,1,2 being the three lowest energies.\nThe phase diagram of the ground state now consists of\nthree parts instead of two for VT = 0. The first part\nis a weak coupling regime for U < Uw including U = 0\nwith Uw \u2248 Uc . In this regime (see inset), \u22061 slowly\ndecreases until the emergence of oscillation at U = Uw ,\nwhile \u22062 behaves similarly except for a sharper change\naround U = 0. Since one has N = 60 harmonic oscillators with the center at xc for U = 0, all low-energy\nproperties can also be obtained from numerical exact diagonalization and perturbation calculations for small-U .\n\nthe interaction. The peaks and dips for sawtooth result from the level crossing. With further increasing of\nU , the ground state becomes degenerate for those small\nintervals of subpeaks, while E2 can be equal to either\nE1 or higher excitation energies in the intervals of main\npeaks. The dips indicate successive quantum transitions\nin the ground state. One has two kinds of excitations\nfor two sides of each sawtooth (for both main and sub\npeaks). The left excitation is given by creating one double occupancy from the ground state, while the right one\ncorresponds to the destruction of a double occupancy.\nFurthermore, the large-U regime, the third part with\nU > Us , is characterized by a unique ground state and\nis related to the fixed point of the large-U limit. At this\nfixed point, E0 is simply determined from the trapping\npotential and the local density ni , since no double occupancy is allowed and ni is simply divided into an inner\npart of ni = 1, an outer part of ni = 0 and an intervenient\npart with ni < 1. One therefore can consider this regime\ncorresponding to the Mott insulator phase of VT = 0. In\nthe large-U regime, two lowest excitations are degenerate. Due to the level crossing at U = 12.75, however,\none has \u22061,2 = U \u2212 12.12 + O(1/U 2 ) at first and then a\n\u22061,2 (= 0.597) almost independent of U . The excitations\nare generated by creating a double occupancy from the\nground state for 12.75 \u2265 U > Us and modifying the intervenient part of the configuration of the ground state for\nU > 12.75. In addition, we have checked the low-energy\nbehavior for odd and sufficiently large N , e.g. N = 59\nand found essentially the same features for U < Us but\na two-fold degenerate ground state for U \u2265 Us . The degeneracy can be understood from the even-odd effect of\nthe number of bosons in the large-U limit.\n\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n\n\u2206\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nU\nFIG. 1: (color online).

A\nstaircase structure develops with increasing U and the upper\npart with ni > 1 is eventually suppressed into a Mott plateau\nwith ni = 1, i.e. a green interface.\n\nTo interpret the above results, we show in Fig. 2 for\nU \u2208 [4, 14] how the profile of ni changes from a nearly\nglobal bell-shape at U = 4 into a complete plateau (green\ninterface) that characterizes a Mott insulator with ni = 1\n\n\f3\nfor both i \u2208 (18, 63) and the large-U regime. While the\nupper part (with red and yellow colors) of the bell-shape\nwith ni > 1 gradually squeezes, a Mott plateau (green)\ngrows from two flanks of ni horizontally at the height\nni = 1 in the intermediate-U regime. We found very\nsurprisingly that the squeezing is discontinuous for sufficiently large U with accompanying staircase structure for\nni . Each staircase involves regularly an oscillation with\nrespect to i but has different numbers of peaks. One can\nclearly see that the last three staircases have one, two\nand three peaks, respectively. We note that when U is\nincreased, ni is first reluctant to squeeze by forming a\nbundle and then suddenly changes into its next bundle\nwith one less peak at a critical value of U ; The area of\nthe upper part for each U is found precisely equal to the\nnumber of bosons involved in the upper part and the area\nbetween two-successive bundles is one within 5 digits accuracy. It turns out that each peak essentially reflects the\ncontribution of one extra boson to the central superfluid\nregion. Therefore we can conclude that the superfluid\nbosons are squeezed one by one into the Mott plateau in\nthe two flanks of ni when U is increased.\n\nsince the quantum fluctuation is not fully eliminated until the size of the Mott plateau \u03beM is sufficiently large,\none has nsi = 1\u2212\u03b4(\u03beM ) < 1 and ndi = \u03b4(\u03beM ) for the largeU regime and i \u2208 (18, 63), although all superfluid bosons\nin this regime are squeezed such that ni = 1 precisely.\nFor U <\n\u223c 12.12 and the curves with the same number of\npeaks, we found that the area between ndi and \u03b4(\u03beM ) in\nFig. 3(a) is twice of the corresponding area in Fig. 3(b)\nbetween 1 \u2212 \u03b4(\u03beM ) and nsi such that the area between\nni and the Mott plateau precisely equals to the number of superfluid bosons.

Bundles for single nsi and double ndi\noccupancies with an increment 0.1 for successive curves.\n\nTo further elucidate the intrinsic physics for the\nsqueezing process, we analyzed the contributions from\ndifferent\nsite i, i.e.\nP number occupancies to ni fors each\nd\nwhere\n\u03b1\n=\ns,\nd,\nt,\netc.\nn\n,\nn\nand\nnti deni = \u03b1 n\u03b1\ni\ni\ni\nnote single and double, triple occupancies of bosons at\nsite i, respectively. n\u03b1\ni can be obtained directly from the\neigenvalues of the reduced density matrix \u03c1i at i. For\nU \u2208 [4, 14], we found that nsi and ndi are larger than\nthe rest by two orders of magnitude at least. Figure. 3\nshows nsi and ndi only with U \u2208 [7.6, 14] for clearness.\nOne can see that an oscillating structure similar to ni\noccurs for both nsi and ndi , but valleys in nsi correspond\nto peaks in ndi one by one. This implies the correlation\nbetween the single and double occupancies. Moreover,\n\nFigure 4 shows, for the intermediate and large-U\nregimes, the average double occupancy nd , the visibility V, and the maximum value Smax and the fullwide half-maximum(FWHM) for the momentum distribution, which were used to study the Mott insulator\ntransition[17]. In the large-U regime, nd and Smax\nchange much slower than V and FWHM. When U is\nsufficiently large in the intermediate regime, a series of\nstaircases develop for all four quantities as those shown\nsimilarly for ni in Fig. 2. One can easily see that long\nand short staircases show up alternatively and correspond to even and odd number of superfluid bosons in\nthe central region of ni , respectively. Comparing this to\nFig. 1, one can also see that the shorter staircases correspond to those degenerate ground states with smaller\nintervals. The longer red and shorter green staircases in\nFig. 4 correspond to the red and green curves in Fig.\n3 as well as the last main and sub-peaks in Fig. 1. In\nfact, once the Mott plateau of ni emerges at ni = 1 in\nthe squeezing process, the number of bosons involved in\nthe intervenient as well as inner parts is even and is no\nlonger changed. It turns out that squeezing one superfluid boson enlarges the size of the Mott plateau by one.\nThis implies that the degeneracy of the ground state, i.e.\n\n\f4\nthe alternating nature, depends crucially on whether the\nnumber of superfluid bosons is even or odd. Moreover,\nwhen the ground state is non-degenerate, it would evoke\nlarger quantum fluctuation to squeeze a superfluid boson into the Mott plateau since a two-fold degenerate\nground state is subsequently generated. Therefore, the\nalternating nature reflects different quantum fluctuations\nin the squeezing process and a quantum transition in the\nground state occurs at the edge of each staircase.\n1.2 U=6.5\n0.6\n0.0\n1.2 U=7.5\n+\n\u03c1i,j 0.6\n0.0\n1.2 U=9.6\n+\n\u03c1i,j 0.6\n0.0\n- 1.2 U=9.6\n\u03c1i,j 0.6\n0.0\n1.2 U=9.8\n+\n\u03c1i,j 0.6\n0.0\n0\n\n(a)\n\n\u03c1i,j\n\n+\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nteracting bosons in one-dimensional optical lattice with\na harmonic trapping potential. Those transitions reflect\nthe quantized squeezing process of the interacting bosons\ninto the Mott insulator phase, revealing novel many-body\neffects resulting from the interplay of the trapping potential with the competition between the kinetic energy and\nthe many-body interaction. These induced effects are relevant for the interpretation of the Mott transition to the\ntrapped atomic systems in all dimensions, in principle,\nsince the trapping potential introduces an independent\nadditional physical parameter, calling for further experimental explorations.\nWe are grateful to Jingyu Gan, Tao Li, Xiancong Lu,\nBruce Normand, Shaojing Qin, Shijie Yang, Li You, Lu\nYu, Fuchuan Zhang and Jize Zhao for fruitful discussions.\nThis work was supported in part by NFC2005CB32170X,\nand NSFC10425417, C10674142 & 90503004.\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\ni\nFIG. 5: (color online).

There is always\nan even-parity ground state with the present trapping\npotential. The odd parity ground state occurs only when\nthe ground state is degenerate for those small intervals\nof U with sub-peaks as seen from Fig. 1 corresponding\nto the shorter staircases in Fig. 4. One can see the significantly different behavior of \u03c1\u00b1\ni,j for different U and\nj as well. As expected, \u03c1\u00b1\ndecay\nfaster for j in the\ni,j\nMott plateau than in the other regions. The correlation\nrange extends over a regime with a non-zero occupancy\nof bosons as seen from (a) and (b), but is substantially\nsuppressed when the size of the Mott plateau is sufficiently large as shown in (c)-(e). Moreover, for those U at\nwhich \u22061 reaches its local minima (see Fig.1), \u03c1\u00b1\ni,15 (red\ncurves) for j = 15 show that the correlation is greatly enhanced with i in the right side of the intervenient regime\nas shown in (a)-(d). The enhancement is the largest when\nthe ground state is degenerate as seen in (c) and (d).\nIn summary, we have shown that a series of successive\nquantum transitions exist in the intermediate regime between the superfluid and Mott insulator phases for in-\n\n[1] C.
