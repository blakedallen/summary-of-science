During the early photospheric\nphase, for example, SN Ia spectra lack conspicuous lines of hydrogen and contain a strong\nabsorption feature at about 6150 \u00c5 due to blueshifted Si II \u03bb6355. The inferred expansion\nvelocity of the ejecta is more than 10,000 km s\u22121 , implying a violent explosion.\nA striking characteristic of SNe Ia is that they display a remarkable degree of similarity,\nmore than any other subclass of SNe, and their spectral evolution follows a reproducible\npattern (e.g., Kirshner et al. 1973; Branch & Tammann 1992; Wells et al. 1994; Filippenko\n1997). The light curves of SNe Ia are also impressively homogeneous (e.g., Leibundgut et\nal. 1992; Branch & Tammann 1992). At maximum brightness the color is strongly peaked\nnear B \u2212 V = 0 mag (Patat et al. 1997), and the absolute magnitude has a much smaller\ndispersion than in other subclasses of SNe. For example, the dispersion of the Cal\u00e1n/Tololo\nSurvey is only \u223c 0.2 mag when a few observationally red SNe Ia are excluded (Hamuy et\nal. 1996). Thus, SNe Ia have been considered homogeneous and used as \"standard candles\"\n(see Branch & Tammann 1992 for a review).\nAs summarized by Filippenko (1997) and in Section 2, however, the existence of the\npeculiar SN Ia 1986G and the appearance of two very peculiar SNe Ia (1991T and 1991bg)\nin the same year have drawn attention to diversity among SNe Ia. These variations have\nraised concerns about the cosmological utility of SNe Ia. In an attempt to quantify the\nrate of spectroscopically peculiar SNe Ia in the existing observed sample, Branch, Fisher, &\nNugent (1993, hereafter BFN) compiled a set of 84 SNe Ia, and subclassified them as either\nnormal or like one of the known peculiar SNe Ia: SN 1986G, SN 1991T, or SN 1991bg.\nThey found that their sample is affected by the Malmquist bias; nevertheless, about 83%\nto 89% of their sample is normal. Even among the relatively normal SNe Ia, however,\nthere are observed differences in spectra and light curves (e.g., Filippenko 1997; Hamuy et\nal. 1996; Riess et al. 1999a). Fortunately, the variation in luminosity is correlated with\nlight-curve shape, providing a means to calibrate the peak luminosity of SNe Ia [e.g., the\n\u2206m15 (B) method \u2013 Phillips 1993, Hamuy et al. 1996, Phillips et al. 1999; the multi-color\nlight-curve shape method \u2013 Riess, Press, & Kirshner 1996, Riess et al. 1998; the stretch\nmethod \u2013 Perlmutter et al. 1997]. Moreover, the photometric sequence exhibited by SNe Ia\nrepresents a spectroscopic sequence, from overluminous (by \u223c0.4 mag in V ) SN 1991T-like\nobjects to subluminous (by \u223c2 mag in V ) SN 1991bg-like objects (Nugent et al. 1995).\nThe intrinsic peculiarity rate of SNe Ia has implications for our understanding of SNe\nIa, especially their progenitor systems. SNe Ia are thought to come from thermonuclear\nexplosions of mass-accreting white dwarfs in binary systems, when their masses reach the\ncritical Chandrasekhar mass (\u223c 1.4 M\u2299 ; for a review see Branch et al. 1995). The exact\nnature of the progenitors, however, is still controversial, and many scenarios have been\nproposed. If the majority of SNe Ia are normal, we might expect SNe Ia to come from one\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nclass of progenitor system, and the peculiar SNe Ia to come from some variation of the same\nsystem; on the other hand, if a significant fraction of SNe Ia are peculiar, additional classes\nof progenitor systems might be warranted.\nIn the past several years, many SNe Ia have been discovered in the course of two\nsuccessful nearby SN surveys \u2013 the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS; Treffers et\nal. 1997; Li et al. 2000a; Filippenko et al. 2000) with the Katzman Automatic Imaging\nTelescope (KAIT), and the Beijing Astronomical Observatory Supernova Survey (BAOSS;\nLi et al. 1996) with a 0.6-m telescope. Here we study the peculiarity rate of SNe Ia from\nthese two surveys. In Sec. 2 we discuss the sample of SNe Ia used in the statistics, which\nconsists of 45 SNe Ia discovered by LOSS and BAOSS (up through SN 2000A). Sec. 3\nreports the observed and intrinsic peculiarity rate and luminosity function. The implications\nof our statistics are discussed in Sec. 4, and Sec. 5 summarizes our conclusions.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nThe Sample of Type Ia SNe\nDefinition of Peculiar SNe Ia\n\nAs we attempt to compare our results to those of BFN, we follow their definition of\nnormal and peculiar SNe Ia. A summary of this definition is given here; see also Filippenko\n(1997).\nA \"normal\" SN Ia is defined as one whose optical spectra resemble those of SNe 1981B\n(Branch et al. 1983), 1989B (Barbon et al. 1990), 1992A (Kirshner et al. 1993), and 1972E\n(Kirshner et al. 1973). Normal SNe Ia near maximum light show conspicuous absorption\nfeatures near 6150 \u00c5 due to Si II and near 3750 \u00c5 due to Ca II. Other absorption features\ninclude those of Co II, S II, O I, and Mg II, as well as additional lines of Si II and Ca II.\nTwo weeks after maximum the Si II 6150 \u00c5 and the Ca II 3750, 8300 \u00c5 lines are strong,\nseveral Fe II lines develop at the blue end of the spectrum, and the absorption near 5700 \u00c5\nis usually attributed to Na I. Blends of forbidden emission lines of iron and cobalt dominate\nthe nebular phase, starting about a month past maximum brightness.\nA \"spectroscopically peculiar\" SN Ia is defined as one that has feature strengths (not\njust expansion velocities) that differ significantly from those of the normal ones at a given\nphase. Three well-observed examples, SNe 1991T, 1991bg, and 1986G, serve as prototypes\nof peculiar SNe Ia.\nSpectra of SN 1991T (Filippenko et al. 1992a; Phillips et al. 1992; Ruiz-Lapuente\net al. 1992; Jeffery et al. 1992; Mazzali et al. 1995) before maximum brightness are\nstrikingly peculiar in having unusually weak lines of Si II, S II, and Ca II, yet prominent\nhigh-excitation features of Fe III. The usual Si II, S II, and Ca II lines develop in the\npost-maximum spectra, and by a few weeks past maximum the spectra look nearly normal.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nHowever, as Filippenko et al. (1992a) and Li et al. (1999) pointed out, at late times subtle\ndifferences still exist between high-quality spectra of SN 1991T-like objects and those of\nnormal SNe Ia. SN 1999aa (Filippenko, Li, & Leonard 1999) is similar to SN 1991T (Figure\n1) in having very weak Si II 6150 \u00c5 absorption and prominent Fe III lines near 4300 \u00c5 and\n5000 \u00c5, but it also shows strong absorption centered at 3750 \u00c5 that is probably due to Ca\nII H&K, which is very weak in SN 1991T. Whether objects like SN 1999aa (to be discussed\nin more detail by Li et al. 2000c) are of an intermediate type between SN 1991T-like events\nand normal SNe Ia remains to be determined. Not to complicate the classification scheme,\nhowever, here we still classify SN 1999aa-like objects as \"SN 1991T-like,\" even though most\nSN 1991T-like objects seem to actually be like SN 1999aa. At this time there is widespread\nfamiliarity with SN 1991T subclass, whereas SN 1999aa-like objects were only recently\nrecognized and are unknown to most researchers. See Section 4.1 for further discussion of\nthis issue.\nThe main spectral peculiarities of SN 1991bg (Filippenko et al. 1992b; Leibundgut et\nal. 1993; Turatto et al. 1996; Mazzali et al. 1997), when at maximum brightness, are the\npresence of a broad absorption trough extending from about 4100 to 4400 \u00c5 due to Ti II\nlines, and enhanced Si II 5800 \u00c5 absorption relative to Si II 6150 \u00c5.\nSN 1986G (Phillips et al. 1987; Cristiani et al. 1992) is similar to SN 1991bg but less\nextreme. The Ti II 4100-4400 \u00c5 absorption trough is present in the spectra of SN 1986G,\nyet is weaker than that of SN 1991bg. Since it is difficult to differentiate SN 1986G-like\nobjects from SN 1991bg-like ones without having excellent data, we have combined the two\nclasses together, and call them SN 1991bg-like objects hereafter, unless otherwise noted.\nVarious authors have shown that the spectroscopic behavior of SNe Ia is correlated\nwith their photometric behavior, which in turn is related to their absolute magnitudes (e.g.,\nNugent et al. 1995; Filippenko 1997, and references therein). SN 1991T-like objects rise\nto their maximum more slowly and decline more slowly, and are overluminous relative to\nnormal SNe Ia; SN 1991bg-like objects rise to their maximum and decline more quickly, and\nare subluminous relative to normal SNe Ia. Thus light curves, if available, can often serve\nas an independent check of the peculiarities of SNe Ia, though exceptions do exist (e.g., SN\n1992bc, Maza et al. 1994; SN 1999ee, Hamuy 2000, private communication).\n\n2.2.\n\nThe Sample of SNe Ia\n\nWe have compiled a set of 45 nearby SNe Ia discovered in the sample galaxies of LOSS\nand BAOSS. This includes 38 SNe Ia discovered by LOSS and BAOSS, and 7 SNe Ia that\nwere initially discovered by other groups, but were subsequently rediscovered in the course\nof LOSS or BAOSS. Table 1 lists the information for all these SNe in the following format:\nColumn (1): SN name. Column (2): host galaxy of the SN. Column (3): the Hubble type\nof the host galaxy. A classification followed by a \":\" means it is uncertain. Column (4):\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nthe number of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) Circular that contains the\nspectroscopic classification of the SN. Column (5): the age of the SN at the time of the\nspectroscopic classification, relative to the time of B-band maximum brightness. This is\ngenerally not the age of the SN at discovery, as it takes severals days (sometimes longer)\nfor the spectroscopic classification of a SN to be made. The quoted ages are derived either\nfrom the IAU Circular listed in Column (4), which are marked with a colon and generally\nhave uncertainties of about \u00b15 days, or from our own light-curve database and/or spectral\nanalysis, which usually have uncertainties of about \u00b12 days. Column (6): discoverer of\nthe SN. \"L\" means LOSS, \"B\" means BAOSS, and \"O\" means other groups. Column (7):\nwhether the SN is peculiar. If it is, the type of peculiarity is listed. Objects marked as\npeculiar type \"91Taa \" are those that are similar to SN 1999aa as discussed earlier. For SNe\n1997cw and 1999gp, no spectroscopic information are available to us to determine whether\nthey are SN 1999aa-like, and they are classified as \"91T/91Taa \". Columns (8) to (11):\nevidence of the peculiarity of the SN. Specifically, Ti II absorption (Col. 8), a relatively\nstrong Si II 5800 \u00c5 absorption (Col. 9), prominent Fe III absorption lines (Col. 10), and\nweak or no Si II 6150 \u00c5 absorption (Col. 11). Our major source of information for the host\ngalaxies of the SNe is NED1 , and that for the SNe is the IAU Circulars.\nOne danger of using the information in the IAUCs to subclassify a SN Ia is that it\nwas most likely derived by the observer during, or shortly after the observations. This\n\"on-the-fly\" classification might result in quick-look reduction errors and approximations.\nThe subclassification also depends on the observer's ability to recognize the peculiarities in\nthe spectra of SNe Ia and the willingness to include the information in the report to the\nIAUC. Sometimes classifications of SNe in the IAUCs are revised because of subsequent\nobservations or reductions. For this reason, we count a SN Ia as peculiar only when there\nis direct evidence of peculiarity included in the classification of the SN in IAUCs, or we\nhave our own spectra to support the classification. Columns (8) to (11) in Table 1 list\nthe evidence reported in the relevant IAUCs. A SN is classified as SN 1999bg/1986G-like\nonly when there is evidence in the IAUC that its spectrum shows Ti II absorption and a\nrelatively strong Si II 5800 \u00c5 line, while a SN 1991T-like object must show evidence of Fe\nIII absorption lines and weak (or absent) Si II lines.\nWe have classified two SNe as peculiar even though they were not listed as such in the\nIAUCs. SN 1999bh was discovered by LOSS (Li 1999). Aldering et al. (1999) reported that\nthe spectrum was of a SN Ia within one week after maximum brightness. Nugent (1999)\ncommunicated that Aldering's spectrum of SN 1999bh resembled SN 1986G at 3 days past\nmaximum. In addition, comparisons of its spectrum at a month past maximum to that of\na normal SN Ia (SN 1998bu; Jha et al. 1999) and a SN 1991bg-like SN Ia (SN 1997cn;\n1\n\nThe NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) is operated by the Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics\nand Space Administration.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nTuratto et al. 1998) at comparable epochs (Figure 2) reveal that SN 1999bh is similar to\nSN 1997cn at this phase. We thus classify SN 1999bh as a SN 1986G/1991bg-like object.\nSN 1999dg was also discovered by LOSS (Modjaz & Li 1999). Filippenko, Metzger, &\nSmall (1999) classified it as a SN Ia within a week past maximum brightness. A spectrum\nof the SN is shown in Figure 1. Apparent Ti II absorption is seen at around 4100-4300 \u00c5,\nand the Si II absorption at 5800 \u00c5 is relatively strong. We classify SN 1999dg as a SN\n1986G/1991bg-like object.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nStatistics\n\nThe Observed Peculiarity Rate\n\nOut of the 45 SNe in our sample, 9 are SN 1991T-like and 7 are SN 1991bg-like. The\ntotal peculiarity rate is 36\u00b19%. The rate for SN 1991T-like objects is 20\u00b17%, and for\nSN 1991bg-like objects it is 16\u00b16%. The uncertainties quoted here are derived only from\nPoisson statistics. Our total peculiarity rate is substantially higher than the BFN result\n(less than 17%); details are presented in Sec. 4.2.\n\n3.2.\n\nThe Intrinsic Peculiarity Rate\n\nBecause of the variations among the luminosities, light-curve shapes, and spectral\nevolution of different kinds of SNe Ia, there are several possible observational biases in the\nobserved SN sample, and the observed peculiarity rate could be either an overestimate or\nan underestimate of the intrinsic peculiarity rate. The relationship between the observed\nand the intrinsic peculiarity rates largely depends on the way the SNe are discovered \u2013 that\nis, on the survey methods.\nSN surveys can be generally divided into two categories, magnitude-limited and\ndistance-limited. In a magnitude-limited SN survey, the target fields are usually random\nregions on the sky that contain many galaxies at different redshifts. The number of SNe\ndiscovered depends on the detection limit of the images (hence magnitude-limited). Target\nfields for a distance-limited SN survey, on the other hand, are individual galaxies or clusters\nof galaxies. The limiting magnitude of the survey images may be much deeper than all the\npossible SNe in the sample galaxies or clusters (as long as they aren't heavily extinguished),\nso the number of SNe discovered largely depends on the number and distances of the sample\ngalaxies or clusters (hence distance-limited). A few SN surveys can be best described as a\nhybrid of these two categories. They are distance-limited, but many of the discovered SNe\nare in the background of the target galaxies and some of them have magnitudes close to the\ndetection limit of the survey images.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nLi et al. (2000b; hereafter Paper I) have used Monte Carlo simulations to study\nvarious observational biases of SN Ia observations in SN surveys. They found that there\nare four main observational biases. The \"age bias,\" which is caused by the fact that SN\n1991T-like objects can only be easily identified with spectra taken prior to or near maximum\nbrightness; the Malmquist bias, which is caused by the difference in luminosity among\nSNe Ia; the \"light-curve shape bias,\" which is caused by the difference in the light-curve\nshapes of SNe Ia; and the \"extinction bias,\" which is caused by the fact that SN 1991T-like\nobjects often occur in dusty, star-forming regions and may suffer more extinction than the\nother objects. They also found that the effect of these biases depends on the characteristics\nof the SN survey, such as distance-limited or magnitude-limited, baseline, and limiting\nmagnitude. The adopted cutoff for the age bias and the assumed extra extinction applied to\nSN 1991T-like objects for the extinction bias also play important roles in determining the\nresults of the observations. One result from the simulations (Figures 11 and 15 in Paper I) is\nthat for a distance-limited survey conducted in the R band with (a) the limiting distance set\nto where normal SNe Ia have a peak apparent magnitude of 16.0, (b) a limiting magnitude\nof 19.0, and (c) a baseline of \u2264 10 days, all the observational biases play negligible roles\n(even for extreme cases such as a cutoff of 1 day before maximum light for the age bias, and\nan extra extinction of 0.8 mag for SN 1991T-like objects) and all SNe Ia are found in the\nsurvey, yielding the intrinsic peculiarity rate and the luminosity function of SNe Ia.\nLOSS searches about 5000 fields containing 6000 galaxies, most of which have radial\nvelocities less than 8,000 km s\u22121 . BAOSS searches about 3000 fields containing some\n4,000 target galaxies (BAOSS has a larger field of view than LOSS), most of which have\nradial velocities less than 6,000 km s\u22121 . For the period of this study, most galaxies in the\ntwo searches overlapped, but whereas BAOSS searches more galaxies in the winter season\nwhen it has good weather, LOSS searches more galaxies in the summer season for the\nsame reason. Both surveys are condutcted in unfiltered mode, whose closest match to the\nstandard passbands is R. Using a Hubble constant of 65 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , and an absolute\nmagnitude of normal SNe Ia of M(B) = \u221219.5, we derive that the limiting distances for\nLOSS and BAOSS are where normal SNe Ia have apparent peak magnitudes of 16.0 and\n15.3, respectively. Figure 3 shows the number of galaxies in the LOSS sample versus the\nexpected peak apparent magnitude of normal SNe Ia. We see that more than 96% of the\nexpected SNe Ia in the sample galaxies have peak apparent magnitudes brighter than 16\n(the dashed vertical line). The usual survey images of LOSS and BAOSS have a limiting\nmagnitude of about 19.0, much fainter than the faintest normal, unextinguished SNe Ia in\nthe samples. The two surveys are thus limited by the distances of their sample galaxies and\nbelong to the distance-limited SN surveys.\nBecause of the high observation efficiencies (80 images per hour for LOSS and 60 for\nBAOSS), the two surveys have short baselines. Depending on the right ascension of the\ngalaxies, LOSS has baselines of about 4 to 8 days and BAOSS has baselines of 4 to 10 days.\nSometimes, because of spells of poor weather, the intervals between observations are longer\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nthan 10 days for either LOSS or BAOSS, but fortunately the weather in the two surveys is\nlargely complementary as noted above. Since most sample galaxies are in both surveys, the\ncombined result is a baseline <\n\u223c 10 days.\nThe Monte Carlo simulations in Paper I indicate that for the characteristics of LOSS\nand BAOSS, essentially all SNe Ia in the LOSS and BAOSS sample galaxies should have\nbeen discovered (Figure 9 in Paper I), and the observed rates for the peculiar SNe Ia should\nequal their intrinsic values (Figures 11 and 15 in Paper I). [The only rare exceptions are\nSNe that occurred in the host galaxy nuclei that are very bright and star-like, as in the case\nof Seyfert galaxies, and SNe that occurred in galaxies that are well past the meridian at the\nbeginning of the night, which the two surveys don't monitor much (Filippenko et al. 2000;\nLi et al. 2000a).] This means that (1) the observed peculiarity rate (36%) in our sample is\nclose to the intrinsic one, and the 1\u03c3 uncertainty of the rate is \u00b19% according to Poisson\nstatistics; and (2) the observed luminosity function of SNe Ia is intrinsic: SN 1991bg-like\nobjects are 16\u00b16%, normal objects are 64\u00b112%, and SN 1991T-like objects are 20\u00b17% of\nthe total SN Ia sample.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nCaveats Concerning the High Peculiarity Rate\n\nIn discussing the high peculiarity rate of SNe Ia found by LOSS and BAOSS, it is\nrelevant to ask whether this galaxy sample is representative of the general population of\ngalaxies. For example, the sample would be biased if the galaxies were selected to be\npredominantly spirals rather than ellipticals, since the former have a higher SN rate than the\nlatter. It is not entirely clear how such a selection bias would affect the resulting peculiarity\nrate and luminosity function of SNe Ia, because the relation between the distribution of\npeculiar SNe Ia and Hubble types of the host galaxies is still uncertain. This bias, however,\nis only present in the BAOSS sample during its first year of operation (1996, not included\nin the current study), when there were few elliptical galaxies in the sample. The situation\nwas corrected at the beginning of 1997, when a totally new sample was constructed without\nany selection bias against particular Hubble types of galaxies (except, perhaps, the Ir\nand dwarf galaxies, which are under-represented in all galaxy catalogs). A comparison of\nthe Hubble-type distribution of the galaxies in the LOSS sample, which is constructed in\nthe same way as the BAOSS sample but extends to larger redshifts, with that of about\n9,800 galaxies having cz \u2264 8,000 km s\u22121 in the catalog of de Vaucouleurs et al. (1991), is\ndisplayed in Figure 4. In the LOSS sample there seems to be relatively more galaxies of\nHubble type Sc than other types, but the galaxies that are somewhat under-represented\nare actually the very late-type spirals Scd, Sd, and Sdm. The relative fraction of elliptical\ngalaxies in the LOSS sample is about 90% of that in the de Vaucouleurs et al. (1991)\ncatalog, so discrimination against them is not significant.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nAnother concern is whether the high apparent peculiarity rate of SNe Ia in the LOSS\nand BAOSS sample is partly caused by the fact that most of the SNe were discovered before\nmaximum brightness, and more than half of them were discovered at least a week before\nmaximum. At those early times, the spectrum of a SN Ia reveals the physical conditions of\nthe outermost parts of the ejecta, where differences among individual SNe (e.g., metallicity)\nare most likely to reside. The high peculiarity rate found in our sample may thus be\npartly caused by the inhomogeneity of normal SNe Ia at early times. In particular, we are\nconcerned with the SN 1999aa-like objects. Although we classified them as SN 1991T-like\nobjects in the calculations of the peculiarity rates because their spectra show prominent\nhigh-excitation Fe III lines as does SN 1991T, we note the existence of prominent Ca II\nH&K lines in their spectra, which are weak in SN 1991T. Whether these objects are SN\n1991T-like ones, or intermediate ones between SN 1991T-like and normal, or normal ones\ncaught at very early times, remains to be determined. One way to investigate this is by\nstudying their photometric and spectroscopic behavior (Li et al. 2000c).\nTo make our point more clearly, Figure 5 shows the near-maximum spectra of three SN\n1999aa-like objects (SNe 1999aa, 1998es, 1999ac, all at age 1 day before maximum) and one\nnormal object (SN 1994D at age 3 days before maximum). The overall similarity among\nthe spectra is striking. Had the three SN 1999aa-like objects been initially observed at this\nphase or later, they would have been classified as normal SNe Ia. Unfortunately, there are\nno published spectra for genuine SN 1991T-like objects at this phase (e.g., SN 1991T \u2013\nFilippenko et al. 1992a, Phillips et al. 1992; SN 1997br \u2013 Li et al. 1999), so it is not clear\nwhether they showed the same spectral evolution. This comparison raises two possibilities:\n(1) The SN 1999aa-like objects may be (photometrically) normal objects caught at very\nearly phases. In other words, there may be two classes of SNe Ia that are photometrically\nnormal, but spectroscopically distinct at very early times: those like SN 1999aa, which\nshowed Fe III lines, Ca II H&K lines and no Si II 6150 \u00c5 line; and those like SN 1994D (e.g.,\nPatat et al. 1996; Filippenko 1997) and SN 1990N (Leibundgut et al. 1991), which showed\na strong Si II 6150 \u00c5 line and looked normal. If the SN 1999aa-like objects (including\nuncertain objects such as SN 1997cw and SN 1999gp) are counted as normal SNe Ia, the\npeculiarity rate in the LOSS and BAOSS sample becomes only 18\u00b14% instead of 36\u00b19%,\nin agreement with the rate reported by BFN (less than 17%).\n(2) The cutoff of the age bias could be as early as 1 day before peak brightness if the\nSN 1999aa-like objects indeed belong to the class of SN 1991T-like objects. If this is true,\nthe simulations in Paper I indicate that LOSS and BAOSS should still discover all the SNe\nIa early enough and yield the intrinsic peculiarity rate and luminosity function (Figure\n15 in Paper I). Inspection of Table 1, however, shows that this may not be the case. 21\nout of the 45 SNe Ia in our sample were classified later than one day before maximum,\nso the age bias would be significant if the cutoff were one day before maximum and our\nrate of SN 1991T-like objects would be only a lower limit. There are two possible reasons\nfor this discrepency between the observations and the simulations: (i) the age estimates\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nin Table 1 are quite uncertain, especially those with \"0:\" which were reported in the IAU\nCirculars as \"near maximum\"; and (ii) the gap between the time of discovery and the time\nof spectroscopic classification is simulated as a random number between 2 and 5 days in\nPaper I, whereas in real observations, the gap could be much larger. For example, 6 out\nof the 45 SNe Ia in Table 1 were spectroscopically classified more than 10 days after their\ndiscovery; the observations will therefore have a more serious age bias than the simulations\ndone in Paper I.\nAn earlier cutoff for the age bias also has a direct impact on explaining the null\ndiscovery of SN 1991T-like objects in the Cal\u00e1n/Tololo SN survey and the SN surveys done\nat high redshifts (see discussions below).\nThe third concern is that the LOSS and BAOSS sample may suffer from uncertainties\ncaused by small-number statistics \u2013 there are only 45 SNe Ia. While this is not a much\nsmaller sample than the 84 SNe Ia considered by BFN, a more accurate peculiarity rate\nand a more precise luminosity function for SNe Ia will be obtained when more SNe are\ndiscovered by the two surveys.\nThe high intrinsic rate of SN 1986G/1991bg-like and SN 1991T/1999aa-like objects also\nsuggests that they are not uncommon among observed SNe Ia, and raises the question of\nwhether it is appropriate to categorize them as \"peculiar SNe Ia.\" We call them \"peculiar\"\nfor historical reasons \u2013 they were rare until the past two years, and they show distinct\nfeatures in their spectra. Moreover, in comparing our results with those of BFN, it is\nappropriate to adopt the same terminology. With such a high peculiarity rate, however,\nthese events become an important part of the whole SN Ia sample, and they may be\npart of a spectroscopic/photometric sequence of SNe Ia. For example, the SN 1999aa-like\nobjects may be the \"missing link\" between SN 1991T-like objects and normal events. More\nspectroscopic and photometric observations are needed to test these suggestions.\n\n4.2.\n\nComparison with the BFN Results\n\nAn advantage of the LOSS and BAOSS sample is that the SNe Ia came from\nwell-defined SN surveys, which enables the observational biases to be well studied. In\naddition, the assumed extinction of SN 1991T-like objects and the adopted cutoff of the\nage bias, which are at present poorly constrained by observations, play negligible roles in\ndetermining the observed peculiarity rate (Paper I) \u2013 for example, all SNe are discovered\nregardless of the extinction used for SN 1991T-like objects (within reasonable limits). Even\nif SN 1991T-like objects had the apparent brightness of SN 1991bg-like objects (which\nmeans an extra R-band extinction of A=1.4 mag), all of them would still be discovered in\nthe LOSS and BAOSS surveys (just as all SN 1991bg-like objects are discovered).\nThe situation for the SN sample used by BFN, however, is very different. The SNe\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nwere discovered by many different groups using various survey methods. A large fraction\nof the SNe were discovered before 1985 when there were no systematic distance-limited SN\nsurveys and few opportunities for rapid spectral classification. Most of the SNe in the BFN\nsample were discovered after maximum brightness and the spectra used to classify them\nwere obtained even later. It is thus very difficult to disentangle the various observational\nbiases in the sample, many of which were indeed mentioned by BFN. Moreover, since\nmany of BFN's SNe came from magnitude-limited surveys, the uncertain extinction of SN\n1991T-like objects makes it difficult to derive the intrinsic peculiarity rate from the observed\none. The observed peculiarity rate as derived by BFN (less than 17%) is thus a very rough\nestimate of the intrinsic one. The relatively small number for the peculiarity rate quoted\nby BFN can be understood primarily in the following way: (1) the sample underestimates\nthe rate of SN 1991bg-like objects because of the light-curve shape bias and the Malmquist\nbias; and (2) the sample underestimates the rate of SN 1991T-like objects because of the\nage bias. These two reasons also probably explain why SN 1991T-like and SN 1991bg-like\nobjects were not recognized before 1990.\n\n4.3.\n\nComparison with the High-Redshift Results\n\nDuring the past few years, two groups have presented strong evidence that the\nexpansion of the Universe is accelerating rather than decelerating (Riess et al. 1998;\nPerlmutter et al. 1999). This surprising result comes from distance measurements to about\nfifty SNe Ia in the redshift range z = 0.1 to 1, and is based on the assumption that there\nare no significant differences between the SNe Ia at high redshift and their low-redshift\ncounterparts. Although this assumption is supported to first order by comparisons of\nthe photometric and spectroscopic properties of SNe Ia at high and low redshifts (e.g.,\nRiess et al. 1998, 2000; Coil et al. 2000), there is also some evidence for differences\nbetween SNe Ia at different redshifts. In particular, Riess et al. (1999c) tentatively point\nout that the risetime (from explosion to maximum brightness) of low-redshift SNe Ia as\ndetermined by Riess et al. (1999b) differs from that of their high-redshift counterparts as\ndetermined by Groom (1998) and Goldhaber (1998), although a new measurement of the\nhigh-redshift risetime by Aldering, Knop, & Nugent (2000) diminishes the significance of\nthis difference. Also, we note that Howell, Wang, & Wheeler (2000) point out a difference in\nthe low-redshift and high-redshift radial distributions of SNe Ia in their host galaxies. There\nmay additionally be systematic differences in the colors of low-redshift and high-redshift\nSNe Ia (Falco et al. 1999).\nThe peculiarity rate of SNe Ia at different redshifts, if taken at face value, may be\nanother preliminary indication that the high-redshift SNe Ia differ to some extent from their\nlow-redshift counterparts. Our study shows that the peculiarity rate for the nearby SNe Ia\nis \u223c 36%. For the high-redshift SNe Ia, however, there has not been a single peculiar SN\nIa reported among the \u223c 50 spectroscopically classified SNe (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\net al. 1999; Adam Riess 1999, private communication; Peter Nugent 1999, private\ncommunication). The high-redshift SN searches are magnitude-limited surveys conducted in\napproximately the rest-frame B band with a baseline of \u223c 20 days in the rest frame. With\nthe intrinsic luminosity function for SNe Ia derived in Section 3, the rates of SN 1991bg-like\nand SN 1991T-like objects can be correctly derived for the magnitude-limited surveys using\nthe Monte Carlo simulations in Paper I. The results are shown in Figure 6 for six cases,\nwith SN 1991T having different amounts of adopted extra extinction in the B band and two\ncutoffs (7 days after and 1 day before peak brightness) for the age bias. We see that the\nrate for SN 1991bg-like objects is less than 2%, regardless of the adopted extra extinction\nfor SN 1991T-like objects and the cutoff of the age bias, so it is not a surprise that there\nhave been few or no such objects discovered at high redshifts. However, if a cutoff of +7\ndays is used to simulate the age bias (the left panels in Figure 6), the rate for SN 1991T-like\nobjects should be 27.3%, 18.6%, and 12.0% for the cases when SN 1991T-like objects have\nno extra extinction, 0.4 mag of extra extinction, and 0.8 mag of extra extinction, which\nmeans that there should be about 14\u00b13, 9\u00b13, and 6\u00b12 SN 1991T-like objects among the\n50 high-redshift SNe Ia, respectively. The fact that there may be no clear SN 1991T-like\nobjects in the high-redshift sample is thus surprising. A natural explanation is that there\nmay be evolution in the characteristics of SN Ia explosions at different redshifts. The\ndisappearance of SN 1991T-like objects at high redshift may result from the loss of certain\nprogenitor channels at high redshift due to a possibly redshift-dependent variation in the\nmass, composition, and metallicity of SN Ia progenitors (e.g., Ruiz-Lapuente & Canal 1998;\nLivio 2000).\nOn the other hand, there are several other possible explanations for the null discovery\nof SN 1991T-like objects at high redshift. These include the following.\n(1) The SNe Ia at high redshifts are very faint, and spectroscopy of them is challenging\neven with the world's largest optical telescopes. Given the fact that it is often not possible\neven to classify SNe at high redshift, it is far more difficult to detect peculiarities in their\nspectra. This problem is exacerbated by the inability to view the region around redshifted\nSi II 6150 \u00c5 in most of the objects; it is at wavelengths inaccessible to optical spectrgraphs,\nand the near-infrared sky is bright. This leaves mainly the Ca II H&K lines as discriminants\nof peculiarity, and makes it difficult to rule out SN 1999aa-like objects (which, recall, we\ninclude here in the SN 1991T subclass). Since most of the spectra of high-redshift SNe Ia\nhave not yet been published, we cannot assess whether the absence of reported peculiarity\nis significant.\n(2) The SN 1991T-like objects may be extinguished by more than the maximum\nextinction of A=0.8 mag displayed in Figure 6. This higher extinction can easily make the\napparent difference in the peculiarity rate at low and high redshifts statistically insignificant.\nTo investigate this possibility we have repeated the Monte Carlo simulations in Paper I\nfor a wide range of assumed extinctions for the SN 1991T-like objects, and the results\nare shown in Figure 7. As expected, the observed rate of SN 1991T-like objects drops\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\ndramatically with an increasing adopted extinction. However, to make the null discovery of\nSN 1991T-like objects among the 50 high-redshift SNe Ia (assuming all have good spectra)\nbe within the 3\u03c3, 2\u03c3, and 1\u03c3 confidence levels of the nearby rate, extinctions of A=0.9,\n1.4, and 2.1 mag must be adopted for the SN 1991T-like objects. Although four known SN\n1991T-like objects showed a significant amount of reddening E(B \u2212 V ) [SN 1991T has 0.13\nmag (Filippenko et al. 1992a), SN 1995ac has 0.17 mag (Riess et al. 1999a), SN 1995bd has\n0.5 mag (Riess et al. 1999a), and SN 1997br has 0.35 mag (Li et al. 1999)], the intrinsic\nreddening due to the SN environment is only E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.11 mag for SN 1991T, 0.13 for\nSN 1995ac, 0.00 for SN 1995bd, and 0.24 for SN 1997br, when the Galactic component of\nthe extinction is subtracted according to the map of Schlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis (1998).\nThus, the average intrinsic reddening for the four known SN 1991T-like objects is only\nE(B \u2212 V ) = 0.12 mag. Assuming a normal extinction curve, the extinction in the B band\nwould be about 0.5 mag. The requisite large extinction (A \u22651.1 mag) to account for the\ndifference between the observed rate of SN 1991T-like objects at different redshifts therefore\nmight not be plausible.\n(3) There may be a more serious age bias \u2013 that is, a cutoff earlier than +7 days for the\nage bias. In the discussions of Figure 5 we pointed out that the cutoff for the age bias could\nbe as early as 1 day before peak brightness. The results for such an early cutoff are shown\nin the right panels of Figure 6. For a baseline of 20 days, the rate of SN 1991T-like objects\nis only 10%, 6%, and 4% for the case when SN 1991T-like objects have 0, 0.4 mag, and 0.8\nmag of extra extinction, which means that there should be about 5\u00b12, 3\u00b12, and 2\u00b11 SN\n1991T-like objects among the 50 high-redshift SNe Ia, respectively. The results with an\nearly cutoff for the age bias indicate that the null discovery of SN 1991T-like objects in the\nhigh-redshift SN Ia sample is not significantly different from the cases when SN 1991T-like\nobjects have extra extinction (A=0.4 or 0.8 mag).\nThe results from the Cal\u00e1n/Tololo SN Survey (CTSS) provide another compelling\nreason to believe that the difference between the peculiarity rate of SNe Ia at high and low\nredshifts is caused by the above three reasons rather than by the evolution of SNe Ia at\ndifferent redshifts. The SNe Ia discovered in CTSS have redshifts of about 0.05, which is\nintermediate to those found at high redshift (z \u2248 0.5) and those found by LOSS and BAOSS\n(z < 0.03). If the difference in the peculiarity rate of SNe Ia at high and low redshifts\nwere caused by the evolution of SNe Ia, we would expect the rate of SN 1991T-like objects\nin CTSS to be in between these two rates. But the fact is that there are no apparent\nSN 1991T-like objects among the 31 SNe Ia discovered in the course of CTSS. CTSS and\nthe high-redshift SN surveys have very similar characteristics: all of them are magnitude\nlimited with a baseline of about 20 days, and all of them are done in the rest-frame B band.\nThe null discovery of SN 1991T-like objects in these surveys at different redshifts strongly\nimplicates the survey characteristics rather than the evolution of SNe Ia.\nThere is also evidence from the CTSS data that indicates serious observational biases\nand further supports this explanation. Mark Phillips (2000, private communication) reports\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nthat only 23% of the SNe Ia discovered in CTSS have spectra at maximum or earlier,\nindicating the existence of a serious age bias. In contrast, 78% of the SNe in Table 1 were\nobserved spectroscopically at or before maximum. Just on the basis of these numbers,\none might expect that 2 of every 3 SN 1991T-like events would be classified as normal in\nCTSS. Hence, for the 31 SNe discovered, only 1.8\u00b11 SN 1991T-like objects would have been\nexpected if the intrinsic rate of SN 1991T-like events were 20%. This small number is not\nsignificantly inconsistent with the fact that none of these events were found.\n\n4.4.\n\nThe Progenitor Systems of SNe Ia\n\nAs discussed in Section 1, the exact nature of the progenitor systems of SNe Ia is still\nunknown. Until this problem is solved, one cannot be fully confident in the use of SNe Ia\nfor cosmological distance determinations. The favored models (for reviews see Branch et al.\n1995, and Livio 2000) include the double-degenerate models which involve the coalescence\nof C-O white dwarf pairs, and the single-degenerate models which involve a single white\ndwarf accreting material from a subgiant or giant companion (systems like supersoft X-ray\nsources, and symbiotics).\nSo far the homogeneity of SNe Ia has provided a very strong restriction to the models.\nBecause it was thought that nearly 90% of all SNe Ia form a homogeneous class in terms\nof their spectra, light curves, and luminosities (the BFN results), researchers have been\nworking hard to choose a single model over all others. It has been proposed that SNe Ia in\nlate-type and early-type galaxies may have different progenitors (e.g., Della Valle & Livio\n1994; Ruiz-Lapuente, Burkert, & Canal 1995), but the homogeneity constraints of SNe Ia\nhave served as an argument against this.\nThe high peculiarity rate found in our study suggests that homogeneity is no longer\nsuch a strong constraint for the progenitor systems of SNe Ia. The high peculiarity rate\nactually may favor the existence of different progenitor systems; with more than one\nclass of progenitor system, SNe Ia are more likely to have different types of photometric\nand spectroscopic properties. For example, perhaps SN 1991bg-like objects come from\ndouble-degenerate progenitor systems, while SN 1991T-like objects have single-degenerate\nprogenitors, or vice versa. A full discussion, however, is beyond the scope of this paper.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have compiled a set of 45 SNe Ia discovered in the LOSS and BAOSS galaxy\nsamples (up through SN 2000A). We find that the total observed peculiarity rate is 36\u00b19%;\nthe rates are 16\u00b17% and 20\u00b17% for SN 1991bg-like and SN 1991T-like objects, respectively.\nOnly 64\u00b112% of observed SNe Ia are normal. Our peculiarity rate is substantially higher\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nthan that reported by Branch, Fisher, & Nugent (1993).\nLOSS and BAOSS are distance-limited SN surveys with a limiting distance where\nnormal SNe Ia have a peak apparent magnitude of about 16.0 and 15.3, respectively. The\nlimiting magnitude of the two surveys is about 19.0 and the baseline is \u2264 10 days. Monte\nCarlo simulations done by Li et al. (2000b) indicate that essentially all SNe Ia should have\nbeen found in the LOSS and BAOSS galaxies. This implies that the peculiarity rate in our\nsample is very close to the intrinsic one, within the uncertainties of small-number statistics.\nMoreover, the luminosity function of SNe Ia in our sample is also intrinsic.\nWe have discussed some other selection effects that may affect our results. In particular,\nwe find that our galaxy samples are representative of the general population of bright\ngalaxies, and that the SN 1999aa-like objects (which are similar in some ways to SN 1991T\nand are included here in the SN 1991T subclass) play an important role in determining the\npeculiarity rates.\nThe high rate of peculiar low-redshift SNe Ia is very different from the preliminary\nresult found at high redshift, which is zero. However, it may be adequate to explain the\ndifference in terms of insufficient observation quality at high redshift, extinction, and/or a\nserious age bias for SN 1991T-like objects. If so, it is not necessary to invoke the evolution\nof SNe Ia with redshift.\nThe high peculiarity rate at low redshifts also suggests that homogeneity is no longer\nsuch a strong argument against the existence of different progenitor systems for SNe Ia.\nWe acknowledge the referee, Mark Phillips, for his very useful comments on the\nmanuscript.
