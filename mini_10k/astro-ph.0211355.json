A new theory of thermal radio emission\nof non-uniform gas basing on the induced origin of emission and its astrophysical applications are considered.\nThe nature of emission from various astrophysical objects is discussed.\n\nPACS numbers: 95.30.Gv, 42.52.+x.\nThe analysis of observational data on thermal radio emission from various\nastrophysical objects leads to the condition of emission implying the induced emission of\nradiation [5]. Here we show that the stimulated character of thermal radio emission follows\nfrom the relations between Einstein's coefficients for spontaneous and induced emission of\nradiation.\nConsider two level system (atom or molecule) with energy levels E1 and E 2 > E 1\nwhich is in equilibrium with thermal blackbody radiation. We denote as \u03bd s = A21 the number\nof transitions from the upper energy level to the lower one per unit time caused by a\nspontaneous emission of radiation with the frequency \u03c9 = (E2 \u2212 E1 ) / h , where h is the\nPlanck constant. The number of transitions from the energy level E2 to the energy level E1\nper unit time caused by a stimulated emission of radiation may be written in the form\n\u03bd i = B21B\u03bd \u2206\u03bd ,\n\n(1)\n\nB\u03bd = h\u03c9 3 / ( 2\u03c0 2 c2 )(exp(h\u03c9 / kT ) \u2212 1)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\n\nis a blackbody emissivity (Planck's function), T is the temperature, k is the Boltzmann\nconstant, c is the speed of light, and \u2206\u03bd is the line width.\nThe number of transitions from the lower level to the upper one per unit time may be\nwritten in the form\n\n\f\u03bd 12 = B12 B\u03bd \u2206\u03bd ,\n\n(3)\n\nHere A21, B21 and B12 are the coefficients introduced by Einstein [1,2], the coefficients\nB12 and B21 being modified to account for the line width \u2206\u03bd .\nWe denote as N1 and N 2 the number of atoms occupying the energy levels E1 and\nE2 , respectively. The levels E1 and E2 are suggested for simplicity to be non-degenerated.\nIn the equilibrium state the full number of transitions from the lower level to the upper\none is equal to the number of reverse transitions:\nN1\u03bd 12 = N 1B12 B\u03bd \u2206\u03bd = N 2\u03bd 21 = N 2 ( A21 + B21B\u03bd \u2206\u03bd ).\n\n(4)\n\nFrom the last equation we obtain\nN 2 / N 1 = B12 B\u03bd \u2206\u03bd / ( A21 + B21B\u03bd \u2206\u03bd ).\n\n(5)\n\nThe line width \u2206\u03bd is suggested to be equal to the natural line width [3,4]:\n\u2206\u03bd = A21 + B21B\u03bd \u2206\u03bd .\n\n(6)\n\nIt follows from the last equation that\n\u2206\u03bd = A21 / (1 \u2212 B21B\u03bd ).\n\n(7)\n\nSubstituting this expression in the equation (5) , we obtain\nN 2 / N 1 = B12 B\u03bd .\n\n(8)\n\nIn the limit of higher temperatures T \u2192 \u221e , corresponding to the range of frequencies\nh\u03c9 < kT , the function B\u03bd ( T ) is given by the Rayleigh-Jeans formula\nB\u03bd = 2 kT\u03bd 2 / c2 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03bd is the frequency of radiation, \u03bd = \u03c9 / 2\u03c0 .\nSince B\u03bd \u2192 \u221e when T \u2192 \u221e , it follows from the equation (7) that the coefficient B21\nis depending on the temperature T in such a manner that B21B\u03bd < 1 . It is clear that B21B\u03bd \u2192 1\nwhen T \u2192 \u221e . The ratio of frequencies of transitions caused by spontaneous and induced\nemission of radiation is given by the expression\n\u03bd s / \u03bd i = A21 / ( B21B\u03bd \u2206\u03bd ) = (1 \u2212 B21B\u03bd ) / ( B21B\u03bd ) .\n\n(10)\n\nThis ratio is approaching zero when T \u2192 \u221e , since B21B\u03bd \u2192 1 . It means that in the\nrange of frequencies h\u03c9 < kT thermal radiation is produced by the stimulated emission,\nwhereas the contribution of a spontaneous emission may be neglected.\nThe quantum of radio emission has the energy h\u03c9 < 10\u22123 eV . In the same time the\ntemperature of radio emitting gas in the case of astrophysical objects usually exceeds 102 K,\n\n2\n\n\fso the condition h\u03c9 < kT is valid. Thus thermal radio emission from gas nebulae and other\nastrophysical objects has the induced origin.\nThermal radio emission of non-uniform gas is produced by the ensemble of individual\nemitters. Each of these emitters is a molecular resonator the size of which has an order of\nmagnitude of mean free path of photons\nl=\n\n1\nn\u03c3\n\n(11),\n\nwhere n is the number density of particles of gas , and \u03c3 is the absorption cross-section.\nThe absorption cross-section has an order of magnitude of atomic cross-section \u03c3=10-15 cm2.\nBecause of a stimulated emission, the attenuation of radio emission will be sufficiently small,\nalthough the value of absorption cross-section is relatively great. In the range of frequencies\nh\u03c9 < kT\n\nB12 B\u03bd = N 2 / N1 \u2248 1 and therefore B12 B\u03bd \u2248 B21B\u03bd . It means that the number of\n\ntransitions from the lower energy level to the upper one caused by the absorption of photon\nwill be approximately equal to the number of reverse transitions from the upper level to the\nlower one caused by the stimulated emission of quantum of the same character as the original\none.\nNote that owing to the induced absorption of light described above Kirchhoff's law [1]\nis not valid in the range of frequencies h\u03c9 < kT , where the induced emission of radiation\ndominates and B12 B\u03bd \u2248 B21B\u03bd .\nThe emission of each molecular resonator is coherent , with the wavelength\n\u03bb = l,\n\n(12)\n\nand thermal radio emission of gaseous layer is incoherent sum of radiation produced by\nindividual emitters.\nThe condition (12) implies that the radiation with the wavelength \u03bb is produced by the\ngaseous layer with the definite number density of particles n.\nIn the gaseous disk model , describing radio emitting gas nebulae [5], the number\ndensity of particles decreases reciprocally with respect to the distance r from the energy\ncenter\nn \u221d r \u22121 .\n\n(13)\n\nTogether with the condition of emission (12) the last equation leads to the wavelength\ndependence of radio source size:\nr\u03bb \u221d \u03bb .\n\n(14)\n\n3\n\n\fThe relation (14) is indeed observed for sufficiently extended\n\nradio sources\n\n[6,7,8].For example, the size of radio core of galaxy M31 is 3.5 arcmin at the frequency 408\nMHz and 1 arcmin at the frequency 1407 MHz [8].\nIn the case of some compact radio sources instead of the relation (14) the relation\nr\u03bb \u221d \u03bb2\n\n(15)\n\nis observed [9]. This relation may be explained by the effect of a gravitational field on the\ndistribution of gas density which changes the equation (13) for the equation\nn \u221d r-1/2 .\n\n(16)\n\nThe spectral density of flux from an extended radio source is given by the formula\nr\n\n1 \u03bb\nF\u03bd = 2 \u222b B\u03bd ( T ) \u00d7 2\u03c0rdr ,\na 0\n\n(17)\n\nwhere a is a distance from radio source to the detector of radiation.\nThe extended radio sources may be divided in two classes. Type 1 radio sources are\ncharacterized by a stationary convection in the gaseous disk with an approximately uniform\ndistribution of the temperature T\u2248const giving the spectrum\nF\u03bd \u2248 const .\n\n(18)\n\nType 2 radio sources are characterized by outflows of gas with an approximately\nuniform distribution of gas pressure P=nkT\u2248const .In this case the equation (13) gives\nT \u221d r,\n\n(19)\n\nso the radio spectrum , according to the equation (17) , has the form\nF\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22121 .\n\n(20)\n\nBoth classes include numerous galactic and extragalactic objects. In particular, edgebrightened supernova remnants [10] belong to the type 2 radio sources in accordance with the\nrelation (19), whereas center-brightened supernova remnants belong to the type 1 radio\nsources. Steep spectrum radio quasars [15] belong to type 2 radio sources , and flat spectrum\nradio quasars [15] belong to type 1 radio sources.\n\n4\n\n\fThere is a direct observational evidence that the outflows of gas have radio spectra\ndescribing by the equation (20). This evidence was obtained for the bright radio\ncondensations emerging in opposite directions from a compact core of the radio counterpart\nof GRS1915+105 [11].\nNote that the synchrotron interpretation of radio emission from various astrophysical\nobjects [16] encounters the essential difficulties. The synchrotron theory is unable to explain\nthe correlation between the spectral index and the radial distribution of brightness for\nsupernova remnants [10], as well as the wavelength dependence of radio source size , since a\nspectral index according to the synchrotron theory has a local origin [16]. The constancy of\nthe spectral index for a jet [17] also cannot be explained by the synchrotron theory predicting\nthe evolution of a radio spectrum to the steeper one.\nPlanetary atmospheres are similar to type 1 radio sources , since the temperature of\nradio emitting atmosphere layers is approximately constant , whereas the gas pressure is\nexponentially decreasing with the increase of height. Since the total thickness of radio\nemitting layers is small with respect to the radius of a planet , the spectrum of thermal radio\nemission of planetary atmosphere is similar to the radio spectra of planetary nebulae in the\nlong wavelengths range [12]. Notice that at the higher frequencies radio emission of planetary\nnebulae is described by the law (18).\nThe induced origin of thermal radio emission is consistent with the existence of maser\nsources associated with gas nebulae and nuclei of galaxies [13,14].\nThe higher brightness temperatures of compact extragalactic radio sources [6] are\nexplained by maser amplification of thermal radio emission. This conclusion is supported by\nthe constancy of the brightness temperature of the radio core of quasar NRAO 530 in the\nwavelength range of 0.3 cm to 2 cm , the flux density obeying the law (18) in the wavelength\nrange of 0.35 cm to 6.25 cm [6]. It is quite possible that the higher brightness temperatures of\nradio pulsars are also connected with maser amplification of thermal radio emission.\nIt is worthwhile to notice that the original Einstein's theory [1] which does not take\ninto account a line width also predicts the induced character of thermal radio emission.\nHowever the account for the natural line width essentially affects the form of relation (8).\n\n5\n\n\fIn the limit of T \u2192 0 , corresponding to the range of frequencies h\u03c9 > kT , the\nfunction B\u03bd ( T ) is given by the formula\nB\u03bd = (h\u03c9 3 / 2\u03c0 2 c2 ) exp(\u2212 h\u03c9 / kT )\n\n(21)\n\nand the relation (8) gives Boltzmann's law\n( N 2 / N 1 ) = exp(\u2212h\u03c9 / kT )\n\n(22)\n\nif we take\nB12 = 2\u03c0 2 c2 / h\u03c9 3 .\n\n(23)\n\nIf we suggest in addition that B12 = B21 , then the line width will be given by the\nformula\n\u2206\u03bd = A21 / (1 \u2212 exp(\u2212 h\u03c9 / kT )) .\n\n(24)\n\nThe ratio of frequencies of transitions caused by induced and spontaneous emission of\nradiation respectively is given by the expression\n\u03bd i / \u03bd s = B21B\u03bd / (1 \u2212 B21B\u03bd ) \u2248 exp(\u2212 h\u03c9 / kT ) .\n\n(25)\n\nIn this range of frequencies the contribution of spontaneous emission dominates.\nNotice that the relation B12 = B21 is no more than hypothesis which cannot be justified\nby thermodynamical approach . In fact this hypothesis might not be valid and then the ratio\n\u03bd i / \u03bd s may exceed the unit. It is quite possible since the coefficients B12 , and B21 are\ndepending on the temperature.\nThe strong argument in favor of induced character of thermal blackbody emission is\nthat the whole range of spectrum is described by a single Planck's function. So if thermal\nradio emission is stimulated one then thermal emission in other spectral ranges also should\nhave the induced character.\nSince the existence of maser sources is closely related with the induced character of\nthermal radio emission , one may expect that laser sources in other spectral ranges also can\nexist.\nOne possible example of laser source is gamma-laser at the Galactic Center emitting in\nthe line 0.511 MeV [18].\n\n6\n\n\fAnother effect presumably related with laser sources is the large fluctuations in widths\nof solar EUV lines [19]. Note that the Sun as an aggregate of small cells with random phases\n[19] may be compared with an aggregate of molecular resonators described above.\nRapid variations of [OIII] line profiles in a Seyfert 2 galaxy [17] is similar effect. The\npolarization of optical emission lines in the spectra of radio galaxies [7] and of rapidly\nvarying continuum in the spectra of BL Lacertae objects [15] also may be explained by a laser\nmechanism of emission.\nMolecular resonator can emit second and higher harmonics. Such thermal harmonics\nare likely to be observed in infrared spectrum of planetary nebula NGC 7027 [12]. There is a\nclear indication of second thermal harmonic in the optical spectrum of the Sun. This effect\nmay determine partially or in whole the deviation of the spectral energy distribution of the\nSun from Planck's function.\nThus it follows from the relations between Einstein's coefficients that thermal radio\nemission has a stimulated character, and it is quite possible that thermal blackbody radiation\nin other spectral ranges also has an induced origin. The induced origin of thermal radiation\nleads to a new theory of thermal radio emission of non-uniform gas having broad\nastrophysical applications and suggests the existence of laser sources in optical and other\nspectral ranges.\nThe author is grateful to V.V.Ovcharov and A.V.Postnikov for useful discussions.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] M.Jammer, The Conceptual Development of Quantum Mechanics (McGraw-Hill, New\nYork, 1967).\n[2] J.R.Singer, Masers (Wiley, New York, 1959), Ch.II.\n[3] L.D.Landau, and E.M.Lifshitz, Quantum Mechanics, Non-Relativistic Theory\n(Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1958).\n[4] V.B.Berestetskii, E.M.Lifshitz, and L.P.Pitaevskii, Quantum Electrodynamics (Nauka,\nMoscow, 1989).\n[5] F.V.Prigara, astro-ph/0110399 (2001).\n\n7\n\n\f[6] G.C.Bower, and D.C.Backer.
