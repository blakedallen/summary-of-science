[1]:\n0.092 \u2264 \u03a9CDM h2 \u2264 0.124\n\n(1)\n\nfor the cold dark matter (CDM) component, responsible\nof structure formations and galactic and extragalactic dynamics, and:\n0.30 \u2264 \u03a9DE h2 \u2264 0.46\n\n(2)\n\nfor the unclustered dark energy component, which is responsible of the current accelerated expansion of the Universe. (As usual \u03a9 denotes the ratio between the mean\ndensity and the critical density and h is the Hubble constant in units of 100 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .)\n\n\f2\nThe nature of both components is unknown. A common and appealing possibility is that dark matter is composed by elementary particles which decoupled from the\nthermal plasma in the early Universe. The dark energy\ncomponent poses more serious problems: a possibility is\nthat it is due to the presence of a scalar field, whose\ncosmological dynamics allows it to become the dominant\ncomponent of the Universe just recently in the evolutionary history of the Universe. Most of the dark energy\nmodels predict that the expansion rate of the Universe\nmay have been different from the one predicted by the\nstandard Friedman\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker (FRW) model at\nvery early stages. Not only dark energy models, but also\nother cosmological models, can predict an enhancement\nof the Hubble rate [2]. If this occurs around the time\nwhen the dark matter particles decouple from the thermal bath, the change in the Hubble rate may leave its\nimprint on the relic abundance of the dark matter. This\nhas been discussed in details in dark energy models based\non scalar\u2013tensor gravity [4] and in quintessence models\nwith a kination phase [5, 6, 7, 8] and for anisotropic expansion and other models of modified expansion [9, 10].\nThis effect implies that the basic CDM properties may\ndepend on the specific cosmological model. Thus, information on the CDM particles may be used to constrain\ncosmological models and vice versa. In this paper we will\nexploit this connection between the dark matter and the\nexpansion rate in order to derive bounds on cosmological\nmodels from observational data related to the dark matter particles. We emphasize that the effects we are going\nto study do not arise because of a direct coupling between\ndark energy and dark matter: they are instead due to the\neffect induced by the dark energy model (or other models\nwith enhanced expansion) on the decoupling of the dark\nmatter particle.\nWe will consider a generic Weakly Interacting Massive\nParticle (WIMP) as candidate of cold dark matter. For\nthe cosmological model we consider models that lead to\nan enhancement of the Hubble expansion rate in the early\nUniverse as compared to the rate in standard cosmology, like those in Refs. [4, 5, 11]. In order to be general\nin our analysis, we will consider a suitable parametrization of the enhancement of the Hubble rate in the early\nUniverse. As specific examples we will then relate our\nparametrization to scalar\u2013tensor gravity (ST) models [4],\nto models with a kination phase [5] and to a Randall\u2013\nSundrum D\u2013brane model [11].\nThe enhancement of the Hubble expansion rate in the\nearly Universe can affect phenomena that are sensitive\nto the exact time at which they occur. This is the case\nfor the freeze\u2013out of a WIMP. The enhanced Hubble rate\ncauses an enhanced WIMP dilution. The WIMP annihilation rate therefore cannot keep up with the expansion\n\nas long as in the standard case. Consequently, the WIMP\nfreezes out earlier in this kind of non\u2013standard cosmologies, leading to a higher relic abundance. The enhancement of the WIMP relic abundance can be very dramatic,\nup to a few orders of magnitude [4, 5]. The requirement\nthat the WIMP is the dominant dark matter component,\ni.e. that its relic abundance satisfies the bound of Eq. (1),\nimplies that the properties of the successful WIMP are\ndramatically changed with respect to the standard FRW\ncase. Since the dark matter relic abundance, apart from\nthe expansion, mainly depends on the WIMP mass and\nannihilation cross section, we can say that the cosmological model has left its fingerprint on the dark matter. A\nfingerprint which could turn out to be one of the most\nimportant signatures of these dark energy and other cosmological models.\nIn fact the WIMPs that in the modified scenario have\nthe correct relic density possess a higher annihilation\ncross section than do WIMPs selected by standard cosmology. This means that indirect detection signals are\nfavoured in the modified scenario. In particular, it has\nbeen shown that the antiproton component in cosmic\nrays is a powerfull tool to constrain dark matter properties, even though it is affected by large astrophysical\nuncertainties [12]. In Ref. [13] combined limits in the\nastrophysical\u2013WIMP parameter space have been derived\nand it has been shown that antiprotons can powerfully set\nbounds on WIMPs in the tens\u2013hundreds of GeV range.\nWe are going to apply the same argument here, from\nwhich we will be able to derive constraints on the cosmological models with enhanced Hubble expansion. We\nwill show that the constraints on dark matter coming\nfrom antiproton indirect searches strongly constrain the\ncosmological models with enhanced Hubble rate in the\nearly Universe. When one studies a specific cosmological model, the model can be constrained by a number\nof relevant observables, related to e.g. Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) [14], Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB), Large Scale structure and Supernovae [15, 16],\nweak lensing [17] and General Relativity tests [18]. We\nwill show that the antiproton bound, under suitable condition, may result in even stronger limits.\nIn Section II we discuss our parametrization of the enhanced Hubble rate, and in Section III we show its connection to specific cosmological models. In Section IV we\ndiscuss the relic density calculation in modified cosmology, for which some useful analytical approximations are\ngiven in Appendix A. Section V deals with the cosmic\nantiproton signal and the bounds on the dark matter. In\nSection VI we then derive the constraints on the cosmological models. Section VII translates our bounds to some\nspecific cosmological models, namely scalar\u2013tensor cosmology, kination models and Randal\u2013Sundrum D\u2013brane\n\n\fA(T)\n\n3\n\n\u03b7=10\n-2\nTre=10 GeV\nTf=17.3 GeV\n2\n\n10 6\n10 5\n10\n\n\u03bd=-1\n\n4\n\n10 3\n\u03bd=0\n\n10 2\n10\n\n\u03bd=1\n\n1\n\n\u03bd=2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\nT (GeV)\n\nFIG. 1: The Hubble rate enhancement function A(T ) as a\nfunction of the temperature. Notice that time is running from\nright to left. The solid red line has a slope parameter \u03bd = \u22121,\nthe dashed green line \u03bd = 0, the dash-dotted blue \u03bd = 1\nand the dotted purple line has \u03bd = 2. For all the curves we\nhave chosen \u03b7 = 102 and Tre = 10\u22122 GeV. The freeze out\ntemperature of the relic WIMP has been fixed to Tf = 17.3\nGeV (a case which refers, e.g., to a particle with mass of 500\nGeV and annihilation cross section h\u03c3ann vi = 10\u22127 GeV\u22122 ).\n\nrate \"re\u2013enters\" the standard rate and by Tf a reference\ntemperature, which we specify below. Clearly the Hubble\nparameter has to approach the General Relativity (GR)\ncase at some epoch Tre & 1 MeV, in order not to spoil\nthe successful predictions of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis\nand the formation of the Cosmic Microwave Background\nRadiation (CMB). These two key events in the history of\nthe Universe are typically among the major constraints\non DE theories.\nIn fig. 1 we show A(T ) for \u03b7 = 100, Tre = 10\u22122 GeV\nand four different values of the exponent \u03bd, which we\nwill use throughout the paper as reference points in our\nanalysis. The figure shows that at the temperature Tf\n(which here is Tf \u226b Tre ) all curves take the same value\n\u03b7 (since \u03b7 \u226b 1). In our analysis, we will take Tf as the\ntemperature at which the WIMP freezes out in standard\ncosmology. In a situation like the one shown in the figure,\nthe parameter \u03b7 gets the meaning of enhancement factor\nof the Hubble rate at the time of WIMP freeze\u2013out.\nThe slope of the curve around Tf is mostly determined\nby the exponent \u03bd. We arbitrarily use in Eq. (5) a hyperbolic tangent to assure that all curves approach unity\nas a continuos function when the temperature of the Universe approaches Tre . However, for analytic approximations that may help to understand our numerical results,\na sharp jump to the standard case at T = Tre is appropriate. Changes in the slope of the re\u2013entering phase will\nbe briefly discussed in Sect. VI C.\n\ncosmology. Finally, in Section VIII we summarize our\nmain results.\nIII.\nII.\n\nTHE HUBBLE ENHANCEMENT FUNCTION\n\nLet us consider a class of cosmological models that\nposses a Hubble rate H in the early Universe enhanced\nwith respect to its value in standard cosmology Hstd . We\nparametrize this enhancement by means of a function\nA(T ):\nH = A(T )Hstd\n\nat early times\n\n(3)\n\nH = Hstd\n\nat later times\n\n(4)\n\nThis situation occurs e.g. in scalar-tensor gravity models\nand in models with a kination phase. Also some models\nwith extra dimensions lead to an enhanced Hubble rate.\nWe will review some of these examples in the next Section\nto show that they can all be covered by the following\nparametrization of the enhancement function A(T ):\n\u0012 \u0013\u03bd\n\u0013\n\u0012\nT\nT \u2212 Tre\nA(T ) = 1 + \u03b7\n(5)\ntanh\nTf\nTre\nfor temperatures T > Tre and A(T ) = 1 for T \u2264 Tre .\nBy Tre we denote the temperature at which the Hubble\n\nCOSMOLOGICAL MODELS WITH A\nMODIFIED EXPANSION RATE\n\nIn this section we present a short list of interesting cosmological models which lead to an enhanced expansion\nrate as compared to the standard Friedman\u2013Robertson\u2013\nWalker (FRW) model based on General Relativity.\n\nA.\n\nScalar\u2013tensor theories\n\nIn a scalar\u2013tensor theory of gravity both a metrical\ntensor g\u03bc\u03bd and a scalar field \u03c6 are involved in the description of the gravitational interaction [19]. Because of\nthis additional scalar degree of freedom, the Universe expands differently compared to a standard FRW solution\nof the Einstein gravity equations [4]. This class of theories can be formulated in different frames related to each\nother by a Weyl re\u2013scaling of the metric [20]. As pointed\nout in Ref. [21], a frame transformation amounts in a\nchange of units and therefore the physical results cannot\ndepend on the frame. A frame-independent formulation\nof the scalar\u2013tensor cosmology is given in [22]. In order to\n\n\f4\ndeal with scalar field-independent masses and couplings,\nin the language of scalar\u2013tensor theories this means that\nwe stay in the Jordan frame. This was our approach\nin the calculation of the effects induced on the WIMP\ndecoupling in scalar\u2013tensor theories in Ref. [4].\nThe ratio between the Jordan frame expansion rate\nand the standard General Relativity expansion rate is\ngiven by [4]:\n[1 + \u03b1(\u03c6)\u03c6\u2032 ]2\nH2\n2\n=\nA\n(\u03c6)\n2\nHstd\n1 \u2212 (\u03c6\u2032 )2 /6\n\ntion to try to set additional limits on these cosmologies\nby means of observables related to the dark matter sector, namely the antiproton indirect\u2013detection signal, as\nit will be described in the next Sections. However, our\ndiscussion may be applied also to other cosmological scenarios with enhanced early Hubble rate, like the following\ntwo relevant cases.\nB.\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03b1(\u03c6) = d log A(\u03c6)/d\u03c6, A(\u03c6) is the Weyl factor\nrelating the Jordan and Einstein frame and a prime denotes derivation with respect to the logarithm of the scale\nfactor.\nTo find a general correspondence between our parametrization in Eq. (5) and a scalar\u2013tensor behaviour of\nthe expansion rate is quite difficult. This is due to the\nfact that the scaling of the ratio in Eq. (6) is deeply related with the cosmological dynamics of the scalar field.\nHowever, as shown in a specific example in Ref. [4], a\nnumerical solution of the scaling behavior of Eq. (6) can\nbe translated in terms of our parametrization. In the\nsimplest case of a slowly varying scalar field (\u03c6\u2032 \u2243 0)\nwe have H = A(\u03c6)Hstd , and in the specific example of\n[4] we have A(\u03c6) = A(\u03c6(Tf ))(T /Tf )\u22120.82 . In terms of\nour parametrization, this example has \u03b7 = A(\u03c6(Tf )) and\n\u03bd = \u22120.82. Fig. 6 of Ref. [4] shows that the enhancement of the Hubble rate around the WIMP freeze\u2013out\nmay be quite sizeable, up to factors of 104 . We remind\nthat the model studied in Ref. [4] was a perfectly viable\nscalar\u2013tensor model, since it evaded all experimental constraints from BBN, CMB and gravitational probe limits,\nlike the Cassini mission [18]. The enhanced Hubble rate\nreflects in an anticipated WIMP decoupling, with an ensuing larger relic abundance. Ref. [4] showed that for\nsuch a fast re\u2013entering of the Hubble rate on its GR behaviour, it may be possible that the already\u2013decoupled\nWIMPs start a brief phase of re\u2013annihilation, due to the\nfact that they are still over\u2013abundant and therefore their\nannihilation rate is larger than the GR Hubble rate. This\nphenomenon has the consequence of reducing the WIMP\nrelic abundance with respect to the value it would have\nhad without re\u2013annihilation. Nevertheless, the outcome\nof this scalar\u2013tensor model is that the WIMP current\nabundance may be larger that the GR one by up to 23 orders of magnitude. This result would then be even\nstronger if a re\u2013annihilation phase does not occur, due to\na slower re\u2013entering of the Hubble rate to GR. Summarizing: perfectly viable scalar\u2013tensor models from the\npoint of view of cosmological and astrophysical observations, may predict a strongly enhanced WIMP relic abundance for a give candidate. This was our original motiva-\n\nKination\n\nA kination is a period in which the total energy density\nof the Universe is dominated by the kinetic term of a\nscalar field. A phase of kination is generically expected in\nquintessence models based on tracking solutions for the\nscalar field, Ref. [23]. When the scalar potential V (\u03a6)\nis negligible compared to the kinetic energy of the scalar\nfield, the total energy density in the scalar field, \u03c1\u03a6 , scales\nlike \u223c a\u22126 (where a is the scale factor of the Universe).\nThis means that during kination H 2 \u221d \u03c1tot \u2243 \u03c1\u03a6 \u221d a\u22126 .\nMore precisely, the ratio between the expansion rate H\nduring a kination period and the standard expansion rate\nHstd is given by:\nH2\n\u03c1\u03a6\n,\n=1+\n2\nHstd\n\u03c1r\nwhere \u03c1\u03a6 /\u03c1r can be written as [5]\n\u0014\n\u00152\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0012 \u00132\nh(T ) g(Tf ) T\nT\n\u03c1\u03a6\n= \u03b7\u03a6\n\u2243 \u03b7\u03a6\n\u03c1r\nh(Tf ) g(T ) Tf\nTf\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nwith \u03b7\u03a6 = \u03c1\u03a6 (Tf )/\u03c1r (Tf ) and heff and geff respectively\nthe entropy\u2013density and energy\u2013density effective degrees\nof freedom. The approximation in Eq. (8) is justified\nonly in a range of temperatures where heff and geff do\nnot change considerably with respect to their value at\nTf .\nFrom Eq. (7) and (8) we see that a kination model\ncan be approximated by our parametrization once the\nfollowing values for the parameters are chosen: \u03bd = 1\n\u221a\nand \u03b7 = \u03b7\u03a6 .\nC.\n\nExtra Dimensions\n\nWe refer to the RSII model [11]. In this model a single\n3\u2013brane is embedded in a five dimensional bulk with a\nnegative five dimensional cosmological constant. Unlike\nother Extra Dimension models, here the fifth dimension\nis not compact and no orbifold boundary conditions are\nimposed. Moreover, the five\u2013dimensional metric is not\nfactorizable and an exponential function of the fifth coordinate multiplies the four dimensional metric. With\nthis set up, a Kaluza Klein (KK) reduction of the five\n\n\f5\ndimensional gravitational excitations gives rise to a spectrum with a zero mode (the standard four\u2013dimensional\ngraviton) localized in the extra dimension and a continuum of massive KK modes weakly coupled to the low\nenergy states on the brane. Due to the fact that the four\u2013\ndimensional gravitons can propagate in a confined region\nof the fifth dimension and since at low energy the massive\nKK modes are only weakly coupled, the theory is not in\ncontrast with experimental gravity even if the volume of\nthe extra dimension is infinite. The Einstein equation on\nthe 3-brane are studied in Ref. [24] and the cosmology\nof such a model is carefully investigated in Ref. [25]. In\nparticular it has been shown that the ratio between the\nexpansion rate H of such a model and the expansion rate\nHstd of standard cosmology is given by:\n\u03c1\nH2\n=1+\n2\nHstd\n2\u03bb\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the tension on the brane and \u03c1 the energy\ndensity on the brane. When the total energy density \u03c1\nequals the radiation energy density \u03c1r we have:\nr\n\u0012 \u00132\nH\n\u03c1r (Tf ) T\n\u2243\n(10)\nHstd\n2\u03bb\nTf\nComparing this expression with Eq. (5), we see that such\na model is described by our parametrization\nwith the\np\nvalues of the parameters \u03bd = 2 and \u03b7 = \u03c1r (Tf )/(2\u03bb).\nIV.\n\nTHE RELIC DENSITY CALCULATION\n\nIn this section we will briefly discuss how a cosmological model with enhanced Hubble rate affects the relic\nabundance of WIMP dark matter. This effect was studied in details in Ref. [4] for the scalar\u2013tensor case and in\nRefs. [5, 6, 7, 8] for the kination case. See also Refs. [9, 10]\nfor anisotropic expansion and other models of modified\nexpansion.\nThe evolution of the WIMP number density n as a\nfunction of cosmological time t is described by the standard Boltzmann equation, the only difference being that\nthe standard Hubble parameter Hstd (T ) is now replaced\nby the modified Hubble rate, H(T ) = A(T )Hstd (T ):\ndn\n= \u22123Hn \u2212 h\u03c3ann vi(n2 \u2212 n2eq )\ndt\n\n(11)\n\nwhere h\u03c3ann vi is the usual thermally averaged value of\nthe WIMP annihilation cross section times the relative\nvelocity. The modification of the Hubble rate can be\nrephrased as a change in the effective number of degrees\nof freedom from geff (T ) to A2 (T )geff (T ). The Boltzmann\nequation is more conveniently solved by rewriting it in\n\nterms of the comoving abundance Y = n/s where s is\nthe entropy density s = (2\u03c0 2 /45)h(T )T 3 and studying\nthe evolution as a function of the temperature T :\ndY\n1 s\n2\n=\u2212\nh\u03c3ann vi(Y 2 \u2212 Yeq\n)\ndx\nxH\n\n(12)\n\nwhere x = m\u03c7 /T . In our analysis we solve the Boltzmann equation Eq. (12) numerically down to the current\nvalue of the comoving abundance Y0 . The WIMP relic\nabundance is then simply:\n\u03a9\u03c7 h 2 =\n\nm\u03c7 s0 Y0\n\u03c1c\n\n(13)\n\nwhere s0 and \u03c1c are the current values for the entropy\ndensity and the critical mass\u2013density of the Universe. In\norder to get some insight in our numerical results, we\nreport in Appendix A some useful analytical approximations which are valid for large enhancements and re\u2013\nentering temperature (much) lower than the temperature\nat which decoupling occurs. Notice that in our definition\nof the function A(T ) in Eq. (5), we use as a normalization temperature the freeze\u2013out temperature obtained in\nstandard cosmology and defined in Appendix A. We report it here for convenience:\nh\ni\n\u22121/2 \u22121/2\nxf = ln 0.038 mpl g m\u03c7 h\u03c3ann viTf xf\ngeff (xf ) (14)\nThe effect of the enhanced Hubble rate on the WIMP\nrelic density can be very important. As was found in Ref.\n[4], and as we are also going to see later in this paper,\nthe relic density can be up to few orders of magnitude\nlarger in the modified scenario as compared to the standard case. From combined cosmological observations we\nhave the very stringent bound of Eq. (1) for the cold dark\nmatter density. This means that the WIMP candidates\nselected in the case of enhanced Hubble rate will be vastly\ndifferent (i.e. have different values of their relevant parameters, like mass and couplings) from the WIMPs that\nfit into the standard cosmology picture. The cosmological model has, in other words, left its signature on the\ndark matter. A signature which might turn out to give\nvaluable clues.\nNot only can we say that the WIMPs selected in the\nstandard and modified cases are different, we are also\nable to say something general about the difference of\ntheir phenomenology. This builds on the fact that the\nstandard WIMP relic abundance in general is approximately inversely proportional to the WIMP annihilation\ncross section. Analytically one finds (see Appendix A)\nthe well\u2013known behaviour:\n\u03a9\u03c7 h 2 \u223c\n\n1\nh\u03c3ann viint\n\n(15)\n\n\f6\nwhere h\u03c3ann viint is the following integration of the thermal annihilation cross\u2013section:\nh\u03c3ann viint\n\n1\n\u2261\nG(xf )\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nxf\n\nG(x) h\u03c3ann vi\ndx\nA(x) x2\n\n(16)\n\nThe WIMPs that fulfill the relic density constraint of\nEq. (1) when calculated with the enhanced Hubble rate,\nwould have a much lower density when recalculated in\nstandard cosmology. From Eqs. (15,16) this then means\nthat these WIMPs have a higher annihilation cross section than WIMPs that satisfy the relic density constraints when calculated with the standard Hubble expansion. A high WIMP annihilation cross section in the\nearly Universe does in general mean that also the current\nWIMP annihilation rate in the Galaxy is high [41]. The\nWIMP candidates selected by the models of enhanced expansion rate are therefore in general more suitable for indirect detection than are the WIMP candidates selected\nin the standard scenario. At the same time this means\nthat the bounds on the WIMP annihilation cross section\ncoming from searches for indirect WIMP signals can be\nused to constrain the expansion rate in the early Universe. In this paper we are going to analyze the constraints coming from the cosmic antiproton signal, which\nis the only indirect probe for which strong constraints\ncan be determined [13].\n\nV. THE COSMIC ANTIPROTON SIGNAL AND\nTHE BOUND ON THE ANNIHILATION CROSS\nSECTION\n\nThe antiproton component of cosmic rays has been\nmeasured by many detectors in space and the most recent\nresults come from BESS, AMS and CAPRICE experiments. The standard production of cosmic antiprotons\nfrom spallation of nuclei on the diffuse Milky\u2013Way gas\nis enough to explain the data [26, 27], but the error\u2013\nbars leave a small room also for an exotic antiproton\nsignal. Such a signal could come from the annihilation of\nWIMPs in the Galaxy (see e.g. Ref. [12]). This situation\nis shown in Fig. 2, where the experimental data are plotted together with the background component and some\nexamples of a signal coming from WIMP annihilation, as\ncalculated in Ref. [12].\nThe antiproton flux produced in a point of cylindrical\ncoordinates (r, z) in the galactic halo, where the dark\nmatter density is \u03c1(r, z), depends on the annihilation\ncross section of the WIMPs averaged over their velocity distribution in the galactic halo h\u03c3ann vi0 and on the\nfinal\u2013state branching\u2013ratios into the different possible fi-\n\nFIG. 2: Primary TOA antiproton fluxes as a function of the\nantiproton kinetic energy. The dashed line denotes the secondary component, due to spallation of cosmic rays (i.e. the\nbackground) taken from Refs. [26, 27]. The other lines are\nrepresentative fluxes from neutralino annihilation of different masses [12]: the solid line refers to m\u03c7 = 60 GeV, the\nlong\u2013dashed line to m\u03c7 = 100 GeV, the short\u2013dashed line to\nm\u03c7 = 300 GeV and the dotted line to m\u03c7 = 500 GeV. The\nastrophysical parameters for galactic propagation assume the\nbest\u2013fit values according to the analysis of Refs. [12, 28].\nSolar modulation is calculated for a period of minimal solar\nactivity. Full circles show the bess 1995\u201397 data [29]; the\nopen squares show the bess 1998 data [30]; the stars show\nthe ams data [31] and the empty circles show the caprice\ndata [32].\n\nnal sates F [12]:\n!\ndNp\u0304F\ndTp\u0304\nF\n(17)\nwhere Tp\u0304 is the antiproton kinetic energy.

[12], where it has been shown that, contrary to the\ncase of the spallation antiprotons [28], a large uncertainty\nin the low\u2013energy tail of the antiproton signal is present,\ndue to the current uncertainties on the astrophysical parameters which describe the diffusion and propagation\nprocesses [12, 28].

The upper bound is shown as a function of\nthe WIMP mass m\u03c7 and has been derived using a median set\nof astrophysical parameters for the antiproton propagation.\nThe upper and lower dotted lines show the uncertainty in the\ndetermination of the upper limit on h\u03c3ann vi0 coming from the\nastrophysical uncertainties. The horizontal solid line shows\nthe lower bound on h\u03c3ann vi0 coming from the relic density\nof cold dark matter in standard cosmology, under the hypothesis that the WIMP annihilation cross\u2013section in the early\nUniverse h\u03c3ann vi equals h\u03c3ann vi0 (like in the case of s\u2013wave\ndominance).\n\nfor antiproton kinetic energies below 1 GeV where a signal may be more promisingly approached for WIMPs in\nthe tens\u2013hundreds of GeV mass range, and without the\nneed of boosted enhancements on the dark matter density [12, 33]. The additional solar modulation effect introduces another source of uncertainty which is expected\nto be less important than the one due to galactic diffusion. Also the uncertainty coming from the dark matter\nprofile is not very relevant, since antiprotons which reach\nthe Earth are produced relatively close in the Galaxy, due\nto diffusion, and therefore they do not strongly feel the\nquite uncertain galactic\u2013center mass distribution. Differences in the galactic halo shape affect the antiproton\nsignal at most 20% [12]. For a thorough discussion of\nall these topics and of the calculation of the antiproton\nsignal which we also use in the present analysis, we refer\nto Ref. [12].\nThe antiproton signal is a powerful tool for constrai-\n\nning WIMP dark matter, since the amount of antiprotons\nproduced by typical WIMPs which can account for the\ndark matter abundance of Eq. (1) is at the level of the\nbackground and may even exceed it sizably [12, 13]. The\nastrophysical uncertainties limit somehow the capabilities of this type of signal, but nevertheless combined limits in the astrophysical\u2013particle physics parameter space\nmay be set, especially for relatively light WIMPs. Ref.\n[13] showed how WIMPs in the mass range from few GeV\nto hundreds of GeV are currently constrained by antiprotons searches. The possibility to set bounds mainly relies on the fact that the low\u2013energy tail of the predicted\nantiproton signal may exceed the room left in the experimental uncertainty of the data over the calculated\nbackground. We make use of the same argument in the\npresent discussion to use the antiproton signal to set limits on h\u03c3ann vi0 and to transform these limits on bounds\non the enhancement of the Hubble rate around WIMP\nfreeze\u2013out under the condition that the WIMPs satisfy\nthe cosmological bound on the amount of cold dark matter.\nA few comments are in order here before we proceed to\ndiscuss our strategy. First of all, we explain why we do\nnot use also other indirect detection signals other than\nantiprotons. WIMP annihilation may obviously also produce gamma rays and positrons. However, contrary to\nthe case of antiprotons which, almost independently of\nthe halo density profile, are naturally at the level of the\nbackground and experimental data for cosmologically relevant WIMPs, both positrons and gamma rays usually\nrequire sizeable boosts in the dark matter density in order to reach detectable levels. This introduces a strong\nmodel\u2013dependent variable which does not allow us to use\nthese indirect signals as reliable tools for setting limits.\nFor instance, a limit obtained from gamma\u2013rays would\nfade out completely unless a very steep density profile\nis present at the galactic center. The same occurs for\npositrons, which need strongly clumped structures very\nclose to our position in the Galaxy. Even though these\nindirect signals are very appealing for dark matter studies, they do not prove to be useful in the analysis we\nwant to carry on in this paper. Very promising will potentially be antideuterons [34], but for that we have to\nwait for the foreseen experimental set\u2013ups able to access\nthe required sensitivities [35, 36].\nFor similar reasons, we are concentrating our analysis on the low\u2013energy tail of the antiproton flux: also\nat energies in the tens of GeV range (where CAPRICE\ndata are available) a signal could manifest itself above\nthe background, which is here fast decaying. Moreover,\nastrophysical uncertainties are less relevant at these energies. However, in order to have large signals in this range\nof energies, we need a suitable WIMP number density,\n\n\f8\nwhich can be likely obtained only with some degree of\nover\u2013density (due to the fact that we need here heavier\nWIMPs, whose number density is damped by the m\u22122\nfactor) [12, 37]. Again, since we do not want to add additional arbitrary inputs in our analysis (the boost factor),\nwe focus on the low\u2013energy tail.\nFinally, we must remind that the antiproton signal\ndepends on (and therefore can be constrained to set\nbounds on) h\u03c3ann vi0 , while the relic abundance depends\non h\u03c3ann vi, i.e. on the thermal average on the annihilation cross section at a different (larger) temperature.\nA constraint on h\u03c3ann vi0 is not therefore directly transferable to a bound on the WIMP relic abundance, and\nvice\u2013versa. The usual expansion of the thermal average:\n\nh\u03c3ann vi = a +\n\nb\n+***\nx\n\n(19)\n\nholds in most of the cases, noticeable differences are\nwhen co\u2013annihilation effects are present [38, 39] or when\nannihilation occurs close to a resonance or a threshold\n[40]. However, in most of the typical cases, the thermal average of the annihilation cross section is mildly\ntemperature\u2013dependent. We will first discuss through\nthe paper the case of temperature\u2013independence, i.e.:\nh\u03c3ann vi = h\u03c3ann vi0 = a. We will then discuss how our\nresults are changed when the first\u2013order expansion of Eq.\n(19) is relevant. The most important effect on our results\nbasically comes from the difference between the freeze\u2013\nout and current value of h\u03c3ann vi, i.e. on the ratio:\nR=\n\nh\u03c3ann viTf\nh\u03c3ann vi0\n\n(20)\n\nTherefore, an estimate of how our results would change,\nfor instance when the relic abundance is determined by\nco\u2013annihilation effects, is to assume a given value for R\nin relating h\u03c3ann vi at freeze\u2013out and h\u03c3ann vi0 . We also\nneed to comment that, in order to apply the antiproton\nbound, the WIMP annihilation must proceed sizably to\nnon-leptonic final states. In fact, for annihilation into\nleptons, antiprotons are not produced and our bounds\nare loosened by a factor given by the branching ratio\ninto non-leptonic final states.\nLet us now determine the upper limit on the WIMP\nannihilation cross section derived from the observational\nupper limit on the exotic cosmic antiproton flux. We do\nnot attempt here a statistical analysis of the data as was\ndone in Ref. [13]. We instead use a simpler approach\nwhich uses the most relevant information coming from\nthe antiproton data and at the same time allows us to\nhave an insight on the results, which could instead be\nmore difficult to obtain by a statistical treatment of the\ndata. This approach was the one also adopted in Ref.\n\n[12]. We consider the experimental result in the lowest\u2013\nenergy bin at Tp\u0304TOA = 0.23 GeV. By subtracting the\nbackground [26], we are left with a 90% C.L. upper limit\nfor the exotic antiproton component at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) of: \u03a6TOA\n= 2 * 10\u22123 m\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 GeV\u22121\np\u0304\n[12]. In order to find the corresponding upper bound on\nthe WIMP annihilation cross section we must specify our\nassumptions in the calculation of Eq. (17,18) of the expected antiproton flux for any given mass m\u03c7 and cross\nsection h\u03c3ann vi0 .\nWe assume an isothermal halo model with core radius\n3.5 kpc and local dark matter density 0.3 GeV cm\u22123 .\nWhen nothing else is mentioned we use the mean values\nfor the set of astrophysical parameters of the propagation\nand diffusion models given in Ref.[12], but we discuss\nalso the set of parameters which provide the maximal\nand minimal antiproton flux, in order to properly take\ninto account this intrinsic and dominant source of uncertainty. As for the antiproton spectrum, we assume for\ndefiniteness that the WIMP annihilate only into a b\u0304b pair,\nand we therefore use the corresponding spectra given in\nRef. [12]. A more generic annihilation final state would\nonly mildly change our results (except for the already\u2013\nmentioned leptonic final state).\nThe result on the upper bound on h\u03c3ann vi0 is shown in\nFig. 3 as a function of the WIMP mass and for the median, as well as maximal and minimal set of astrophysical\nparameters. We notice that the astrophysical uncertainty\nis severe, but nevertheless allows us to set limits on the\nmaximal amount of h\u03c3ann vi0 which is allowed in order not\nto go in conflict with the experimental data. The horizontal solid line instead shows the lower limit on h\u03c3ann vi\ncoming from the cosmological bound on the WIMP relic\nabundance of Eq. (1), in the case of temperature independent thermal average and standard cosmology. The\nfigure clearly shows that there is tension between the cosmological bound and the antiproton limit: in the case of\nthe median bound from antiproton, we see that WIMPs\nlighter than about 50\u201360 GeV lead to an antiproton signal which is in excess of the experimental bound. This\ntension is released if we consider the minimal set of astrophysical parameters (upper dotted curve), but the figure\nclearly shows that antiprotons are a powerful tool for\nsetting limits. Ref. [13] already discussed in details this\ntensions and the corresponding limits. We instead here\nuse this argument to set bounds on cosmological models:\nsince the cosmological models we are discussing predict\nlarger lower\u2013bounds on h\u03c3ann vi, we see that the tension\nwith antiproton data is enhanced and limits can be set\non the maximal amount of enhancement of the Hubble\nrate at the time of WIMP freeze\u2013out.\n\n\fVI.\n\nCONSTRAINING THE HUBBLE RATE\nWITH DARK MATTER\n\n\u03bd\n\n9\n1\n0.8\n\nIn this Section we show how the combined constraints\non the WIMP relic density and antiproton signal can\nstrongly constrain the Hubble rate in the early Universe.\nLet us first recall our assumptions about the Hubble rate\nand the WIMPs. We assume that the Hubble rate is enhanced by a temperature\u2013dependent factor A(T ) in the\nearly Universe, for which we consider the parametrization\nof Eq. (5). At the temperature Tf at which the WIMP\nwould freeze out in the standard case, the enhancement\nfactor is equal to the parameter \u03b7, A(Tf ) = \u03b7 (for \u03b7 \u226b 1).\nThe slope of A(T ) is set by the parameter \u03bd. At a temperature T = Tre , the expansion rate \"re\u2013enters\" the\nstandard one. We consider a general WIMP model characterized solely by a mass, m\u03c7 , and an annihilation cross\nsection. We assume first that h\u03c3ann vi = h\u03c3ann vi0 is temperature independent, and therefore it determines both\nthe relic abundance and the antiproton signal directly.\nThe WIMP should explain the observational amount of\ncold dark matter of Eq. (1), i.e. it must be the dominant\nCDM component.\nIn the following we combine the relic density and antiproton constraints on the WIMP to obtain the upper\nbound on the enhancement of the Hubble rate. As we\nhave discussed, this is possible because the Hubble rate\ntogether with the WIMP mass and cross section determines the WIMP abundance, and at the same time the\nWIMP cross section is bounded from above by the cosmic antiproton data. In Section VI A we find the mass\ndependent upper bound on \u03b7, i.e. the enhancement factor at the time of the WIMP freeze out. In Section VI B\nwe determine the corresponding upper bound on the enhancement of the relic WIMP density as compared to\nstandard cosmology. Finally, in Section VI C we analyze\nwhat happens to the bound on \u03b7 when some of our assumptions about the Hubble rate and the WIMP model\nare changed.\n\nA.\n\nConstraining the expansion rate\n\nLet us in this section show our numerical results on\nthe Hubble rate constraints derived from the relic density and antiproton bound. Our parametrization of the\nHubble enhancement function Eq. (5) has three free parameters: \u03b7, \u03bd and Tre (while Tf is set by the WIMP\nmass and cross section through Eq. (14)). As we shall\nsee at the end of this section, the enhancement is basically independent of Tre , as long as Tre \u226a Tf . This can be\nunderstood also by means of the analytical approximations given in Appendix A. We choose to set Tre = 10\u22123\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n-0.8\n-1\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n\u03b7\n\nFIG. 4: Exclusion plot in the (\u03b7, \u03bd) plane for a WIMP mass\nof m\u03c7 = 500 GeV. \u03b7 and \u03bd are two of the parameters of the\nHubble enhancement function. \u03b7 is the enhancement factor at\nthe freeze\u2013out temperature of the WIMP. The \"re\u2013entering\"\ntemperature has been fixed at Tre = 10\u22123 GeV. The WIMP\nannihilation cross section h\u03c3ann vi is chosen for each point in\norder to fulfill the relic density constraint. This cross section\nhas then been compared to the antiproton upper bound on the\ncross section. The central almost vertical band denotes points\nwhich have exactly the limiting value of the cross section; the\npoints on the left of the band refer to cross sections below the\nantiproton upper bound; the points on the right of the band\nrefer to cross section in excess of the antiproton upper bound.\n\nGeV throughout the paper as a reference value. This corresponds to the lowest value which can be safely assumed\nto be compatible with big bang nucleosynthesis [4]. The\nenhancement of the Hubble rate is then studied in the\ntwo-dimensional parameter space (\u03b7, \u03bd).\nLet us now construct an exclusion plot in the (\u03b7, \u03bd)\nplane. We first fix the WIMP mass at m\u03c7 = 500 GeV as\na reference value. Then, for each point in the (\u03b7, \u03bd) plane\nwe make a scan in the WIMP annihilation cross section\nh\u03c3ann vi. The cross section together with the mass fixes\nTf , which is the temperature at which the WIMP would\nfreeze out in the standard cosmology scenario. We then\nsolve the Boltzmann equation with the enhanced Hubble rate. We can now apply the first bound, namely\nthe constraint Eq. (1) on the relic dark matter density.\nThis constraint selects a small interval in h\u03c3ann vi for each\n(\u03b7, \u03bd). Finally we apply the constraint coming from the\ncosmic antiproton data on h\u03c3ann vi0 , by means of the result shown in Fig.3, which gives us the upper bound on\nthe annihilation cross section for any given mass.\nIn fig. 4 we show the exclusion plot in the (\u03b7, \u03bd) plane.\n\n\fThe points in the central almost\u2013vertical band refer to\nannihilation cross sections h\u03c3ann vi equal to the maximum\nvalue allowed by the antiproton data (using the median\nset of astrophysical parameters) as shown in Fig. 3. The\npoints on the left of the vertical band all refer to smaller\nvalues of the cross section and thus satisfy the antiproton\nbound. On the contrary, the points on the right are in\ndisagreement with the antiproton data as they require a\nhigh cross section in order to fulfill the density constraint.\nNotice that the cross section is not uniquely determined\nby the density constraint, since for fixed values of \u03b7, \u03bd\nand m\u03c7 we can slightly vary the annihilation cross section to move around in the allowed density interval of\nEq. (1). Similarly, points next to each other can have\nidentical cross section and fulfill the density constraints\nwith just slightly different values of the relic abundance\n[42]. Thus, the width of the vertical band, that marks\nthe antiproton bound, is due to the allowed interval of\nthe relic abundance. Also, in the vertical band we do\nnot only have models with a cross section equal to the\nantiproton limit, but also models with a slightly lower or\nhigher cross section.\nFrom fig. 4 we conclude that the constraint coming\nfrom the cosmic antiprotons produced by dark matter\nannihilation can be used to put constraints on the Hubble rate in the very early Universe. The figure shows\nthat, for m\u03c7 = 500 GeV, we get an upper bound on the\nenhancement factor \u03b7 of the Hubble rate at the WIMP\nfreeze\u2013out of around 102 (with some dependence on the\nactual values of the slope parameter \u03bd). This bound on\n\u03b7 may be considered as significant: in Ref. [4] we found\nperfectly viable scalar\u2013tensor models with enhancement\nfactors of up to 104 at the WIMP freeze\u2013out temperature, once the BBN, CMB and gravitational probe limits\nwere satisfied. Our results shows that alternative, and\neven stronger, bounds on dark energy models can therefore be obtained also by looking at the imprints left on\nthe dark matter properties by these modified cosmologies\nat the time dark matter formed in the early Universe, if\nwe assume that dark matter is provided by a thermal\nrelic.\nThe results in fig. 4 were calculated for a fixed WIMP\nmass of 500 GeV. Let us now explore how the bound on \u03b7\ndepends on the WIMP mass. The result is shown in fig. 5.\nEach vertical band corresponds to the maximum allowed\ncross section for any given mass according to fig. 3. Going\nfrom left to right in fig. 5, the vertical bands corresponds\nto the masses 60 GeV, 100 GeV, 200 GeV, 400 GeV, 600\nGeV and 1000 GeV respectively. For any given mass,\nthe part of the (\u03b7, \u03bd) plane to the right of the vertical\nband is excluded by the antiproton data while the part\nto the left is allowed. The constraint on \u03b7 is very strong,\nespecially for low WIMP masses. In particular, the figure\n\n\u03bd\n\n10\n1\n0.8\n\nm\u03c7=60\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\nm\u03c7=100\n\n0.2\n200\n\n0\n-0.2\n\n400\n\n-0.4\n600\n\n-0.6\n\nm\u03c7=1000 GeV\n\n-0.8\n-3\n\nTre=10 GeV\n\n-1\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n\u03b7\n\nFIG. 5: The same as Fig. 4 but including the result for\ndifferent WIMP masses. Going from left to right the vertical bands correspond to the antiproton bound for WIMP\nmasses of 60 GeV, 100 GeV, 200 GeV, 400 GeV, 600 GeV\nand 1000 GeV respectively. For any given mass, the vertical band marks the limit between the excluded part of the\nparameter space to the right and the part to the left which\nis in agreement with the antiproton data. The \"re\u2013entering\"\ntemperature is Tre = 10\u22123 GeV.\n\nshows that WIMPs lighter than about 60 GeV are close\nto being excluded. A word of caution is in order here:\nto make a precise claim on a lower bound on the WIMP\nmass would require a more thorough analysis, since we\nshould include the uncertainty on the propagation and\ndiffusion parameters for the calculation of the antiproton\nflux and also apply a more refined statistical analysis\non the antiproton data. We will show the effect coming\nfrom the astrophysical parameters in Sect. VI C, and we\nanticipate that for the less stringent set of parameters,\nWIMPs lighter than 60 GeV are perfectly viable. These\nresults are in agreement with what is found in Ref. [13]\nwhere a careful analysis of the bounds that can be set\nto the WIMP parameters by antiproton data in standard\ncosmology has been performed.\nFrom fig. 5 we see that the upper bound on \u03b7 increases\nless than an order of magnitude when the parameter \u03bd\nis varied from \u22121 to +1 for any given mass. For large\nmasses, the increase can be two orders of magnitude when\nwe continue to \u03bd = 2. This can be seen in fig. 6, which\ndisplays the mass dependence of the upper bound on \u03b7,\nas derived for four different values of \u03bd.\nThe behaviour of the upper bound on \u03b7 can be understood also by means of the analytic approximations of\nAppendix A.

The bound on \u03b7 is shown as a function of the\nWIMP mass for the slope parameter of the enhancement function \u03bd = \u22121, 0, 1, 2. The parameter Tre has been set to 10\u22123\nGeV. Tf is determined by the WIMP mass and cross section\nby means of the freeze\u2013out condition of Eq. (14).

The\nupper bound on \u03b7 is derived from the combination of the constraint on the WIMP relic density and antiproton signal. The\nnumerical derivation is done for two different WIMP masses\nand four different values of the parameter \u03bd. The masses are\nm\u03c7 = 200 GeV and m\u03c7 = 1 TeV corresponding to Tf \u223c 7.46\nGeV respectively Tf \u223c 31.86 GeV for the limiting cross section.

These behaviours are confirmed by\nour numerical calculations, where we approximately find\n\u03b7max \u221d m2.1\nfor \u03bd = \u22121, 0, 1 (with a slight depen\u03c7\ndence on which masses are used for the calculation) and\n\u03b7max \u221d m3.5\n\u03c7 for \u03bd = 2.\nWe have shown in this Section that we can use the combined constraints on the WIMP relic density and antiproton production to put an upper limit on \u03b7, i.e. we can\nconstrain the Hubble expansion at a very early time in\nthe history of the Universe, as \u03b7 = A(Tf ). The exact temperature at which we constrain the expansion in our discussion, i.e. the standard freeze out temperature Tf , does\nhowever depend on the WIMP mass. Approximately, xf\nis always of the order of 25 (xf = m\u03c7 /Tf ). Some numerical examples are: Tf (m\u03c7 = 60 GeV) \u2243 2.6 GeV,\nTf (m\u03c7 = 200 GeV) \u2243 7.5 GeV, Tf (m\u03c7 = 600 GeV) \u2243 20\nGeV and Tf (m\u03c7 = 1000 GeV) \u2243 32 GeV, where we have\nused the upper antiproton bound for the value of the\nWIMP annihilation cross section.\nFig. 7 shows the upper bound on \u03b7 as a function of\nTre for two different values of the WIMP mass and four\n\n\fThe constraint on \u03b7 = A(Tf ) immediately constrains\nthe Hubble enhancement function A(T ) given in Eq. (5)\nat any temperature once we know the WIMP mass and\nthe cosmological model (i.e. the parameters \u03bd and Tre ).\nIn Figs. 8, 9, 10 and 11 we show the maximum allowed\nenhancement function for different values of the WIMP\nmass and the \u03bd parameter. The curves are derived for\nTre = 10\u22123 GeV. As we just saw, the upper bound on \u03b7\ndoes not depend on Tre when Tre \u226a Tf . Thus, a change\nof the re-entering temperature would solely change the\ntemperature at which A(T ) \u2192 1. Figure 8, 9, 10 and 11\nmay be directly applied to constrain cosmological models\nwith enhanced Hubble rate. For instance, for a scalar\u2013\ntensor model like the one studied in Ref. [4], which refers\nto a situation close to \u03bd = \u22121 (the actual value was\n\u03bd = \u22120.82) and Tre = 0.1 GeV, by comparing Fig. 8 here\n\n\u03bd=-1\n-3\nTre=10 GeV\n\n10 6\n10 5\n10\n\neV\neV\neV\neV\nG\nG\nG\nG\n0\n00\n00\n00\n00\n=1\n=1\n=4\n=6\nm\u03c7\nm\u03c7\nm\u03c7\nm\u03c7\n\ndifferent values of the parameter \u03bd. Models that stay\nbelow the upper bound of \u03b7 would give WIMPs that\neither are under-abundant or produce less antiprotons\nthan the maximally allowed flux. Fig. 7 shows that the\nupper bound on \u03b7 is independent of Tre as long as the\nlatter is much smaller than the freeze out temperature.\nWhen the \"re\u2013entering\" temperature is around one or\ntwo order of magnitudes below the standard freeze out\ntemperature, \u03b7max starts to increase and then becomes\npractically unbounded from above. In other words, one\ncan increase the Hubble rate arbitrarily if this is done\nfor a short amount of time. We see from fig. 7 that the\n\"re\u2013entering\" temperature at which \u03b7 starts to get unbounded is lower for the higher mass case despite the fact\nthat the freeze out temperature is higher for m\u03c7 = 1000\nGeV than for m\u03c7 = 200 GeV. This can be understood\nfrom the analytic solution of the modified Boltzmann\nequation. We compare the contribution from the integration from the modified freeze out until the \"re\u2013entering\"\ntemperature (i.e. the time where we still have enhanced\nexpansion) with the contribution from the integration\nfrom the \"re-entering\" temperature untill today. The\nfirst contribution dominates when the \"re\u2013entering\" temperature is very low. The analytic analysis shows that\nthe two contributions becomes\nwhen\np equal approximately\np\n(T\u0302f \u2212 Tre )/Tre = \u03b7[heff (xre ) geff (x\u0302f )]/[heff (x\u0302f ) geff (xre )],\nwhere T\u0302f is the freeze out temperature in the modified\nscenario and where we have set \u03bd = 0 for definiteness. If\n\u03b7 stays constant then \u03a9h2 \u2192 (\u03a9h2 )std when (T\u0302f \u2212 Tre )\nshrinks to zero. Alternatively, to avoid the WIMP to\nbecome under\u2013abundant we have to increase \u03b7 indefinitely. Since T\u0302 grows approximately linearly with mass\n(T\u0302f = m\u03c7 /x\u0302f and x\u0302f depends logarithmically on the mass\nand the cross section) while the upper bound on \u03b7 (fig.\n6) is approximately proportional to the mass squared,\nit follows that \u03b7 becomes unbounded at lower Tre for\nm\u03c7 = 1000 GeV compared to m\u03c7 = 200 GeV.\n\nA(T)\n\n12\n\n4\n\n10 3\n10 2\n10\n1\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\nT (GeV)\n\nFIG. 8: Maximum allowed values of the enhancement function\nA(T ) as a function of the temperature for our parametrization\nwith \u03bd = \u22121 (close to a scalar\u2013tensor cosmology).

The standard\nWIMP freeze\u2013out temperature is given by the WIMP mass\nand the antiproton bound for the WIMP annihilation cross\nsection.\n\nand Fig. 6 of Ref. [4] we can conclude that the model\nof Ref. [4] is compatible with antiproton data only if the\ndark matter is composed by a WIMP with mass larger\nthan 1 TeV. This example shows how constraining the\nantiproton data may be on otherwise viable dark energy\nmodels.\n\nB.\n\nThe enhancement of the relic density\n\nIn this section we derive upper limits on the enhancement of the WIMP relic abundance in modified cosmologies as compared to the standard case, under the constraint that \u03a9h2 in the modified scenario satisfies the\nbound of Eq. (1). This constraint alone is not actually\nenough to constrain the enhancement of the density, as\nwe shall see. When the antiproton bound for the WIMPs\nis applied we find an upper bound on the density enhancement which is practically independent of the parameter\n\u03bd, but that is of the same order of magnitude as the upper\nbound on \u03b7.\nAs in the previous section we start by making a study\nin the (\u03b7, \u03bd) plane for a WIMP mass m\u03c7 = 500 GeV.

If we had\ncontinued to higher values of \u03b7 we would have obtained\n\nFIG. 11: Same as figure 8 but for \u03bd = 2 (RSII model [11] of\nextra\u2013dimension cosmology)\n\neven larger enhancements of the WIMP density. From\nthe previous section we know that \u03b7 can be bounded from\nabove by requiring that the WIMP fulfills the constraint\ncoming from the cosmic antiproton data. For m\u03c7 = 500\nGeV the bound on \u03b7 was found in Fig. 4. When we\ncompare this figure with the contours of R in fig. 12,\nwe conclude that the antiproton data leads to the upper\nlimit R \u223c 100 for m\u03c7 = 500 GeV. We also see that\nthe shape of the contours of R are very similar to the\nband in Fig. 4 which marks the limiting cross section.\nWe therefore expect the upper bound on R to be almost\nindependent of \u03bd. The final thing to note is that the\nnumerical value of the upper bound on R and \u03b7 are of\nthe same order of magnitude.\nThe upper bound on the relic density enhancement R\nas a function of the WIMP mass is shown in fig. 13, for\nthe four representative values of the parameter \u03bd. The\napproximate behaviour R \u221d m1.9\n\u03c7 can be understood by\nmeans of the analytical approximation we already discussed.\n\nC.\n\nChanging the assumptions\n\nIn this Section we show how the upper bound on\nthe Hubble enhancement \u03b7 moves when some of our assumptions are changed. We are going to consider three\nkinds of modifications: we shall consider a temperature\u2013\ndependent annihilation thermal cross section, by adding\na p-wave contribution; we change the parametrization of\nthe Hubble enhancement A(T ); finally we take into ac-\n\n\f1\n\n((\u03a9h2)/(\u03a9h2)GR)max\n\n\u03bd\n\n14\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n\n10 3\n\n0.2\n10 2\n\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n\n10\n-0.6\n-0.8\n-3\n\n-1\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\nTre=10 GeV\n\n1\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n\u03b7\n\nFIG. 12:\nContour plot of the enhancement R =\n(\u03a9h2 )/(\u03a9h2 )GR of the WIMP relic abundance in a scenario\nwith enhanced Hubble rate compared to the standard GR\ncosmology. The different bands refer to (from left to right):\n1 \u2264 R \u2264 10, 10 < R \u2264 100, 100 < R \u2264 1000, 1000 < R. The\nhighest value of R is around 7.5*103 . We have fixed m\u03c7 = 500\nGeV and Tre = 10\u22123 GeV. For all points, the WIMP relic\u2013\ndensity, as calculated in the modified cosmology, satisfies the\ndark matter density constraint.\n\ncount the uncertainty of the propagation and diffusion of\nthe cosmic antiproton signal.\nLet us first consider what happens if our assumption about pure s-wave annihilation does not hold. In\nthis case h\u03c3ann vi, relevant for the relic abundance, and\nh\u03c3ann vi0 , relevant for the antiproton calculation, are no\nlonger equal. By adding a p-wave term b/x in the temperature expansion of Eq. (19), h\u03c3ann vi turns out to be\nlarger (or smaller, depending on the sign of b) in the early\nUniverse than it is today where the p-wave contribution\nis negligible. The ensuing limit we obtain is less (more)\nstringent than the one we would obtain for pure s\u2013wave\nannihilation, depending whether b is positive or negative. Fig. 14 shows the effect for two representative cases\nin terms of rp = b/(a xf ): rp = 0.5 (lower dash\u2013dotted\npurple line) and rp = 10 (upper dash\u2013dotted green line).\nThe last value is actually extreme and it has been considered to make an example.\nWe notice that the results we obtain for a non negligible p\u2013wave case are similar to what we would obtain by\nassuming a value for the ratio R in Eq. (20) of the order\nof R = (1 + \u03c9 rp ), where \u03c9 \u223c O(1) depends on details of\nthe integrals given in Eq. (16), and therefore also on the\ncosmological model (simple analytical expressions may\nbe derived by means of the approximations of Appendix\n\n3\n\nm\u03c7 (GeV)\n\nFIG. 13: Upper limit of R = (\u03a9h2 )/(\u03a9h2 )GR as a function of\nthe WIMP mass. The bound comes from the combination of\nthe WIMP relic density constraint and the antiproton bound.\nThe lines, which practically fall on top of each-other, refer to:\n\u03bd = \u22121, \u03bd = 0, \u03bd = 1 and \u03bd = 2. The mass lower limit depend on \u03bd (and it depends on the assumption of astrophysical\nparameters, which have been fixed to their median set in the\nfigure). In the figure we have fixed Tre = 10\u22123 GeV.\n\nA). The cases shown in Fig. 14 refer to R \u2243 1.2 \u2212 1.5 for\nrp = 0.5 and R \u2243 6 \u2212 10 for rp = 10. The figure therefore\nshows that the bound on \u03b7max is sensitive to large values\nof the ratio R, as expected. In the case, for instance, of\ncoannihilations, for which R may be a large number (even\nsome orders of magnitude) we see that the bounds from\nantiprotons are much less stringent. Approximately, the\nchange in the upper bound on \u03b7 obtained in Eqs. (25) for\nthe case of time\u2013independent cross section, can now be\nrephrased as:\n\u03b7max =\n\u03b7max =\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0014\n\nR h\u03c3ann vip\u03040 (\u03a9h2 )CDM\nC(\u03bd \u2212 1) xf\n\nR h\u03c3ann vip\u03040 (\u03a9h2 )CDM\nC(1 \u2212 \u03bd) xf\n\n\u0015\u03bd\n\n\u0015\n\nfor \u03bd > 1\nfor \u03bd < 1\n\nwith, again, a slightly more complicated expression for\n\u03bd = 1.\nNow, let us go back to the situation where we have only\na temperature\u2013independent thermal cross section but instead we modify the enhancement of the Hubble rate.\nLet us assume, instead of the enhancement A(T ) defined\nin Eq.

The reference\ncase is the red solid curve which is identical to our previous\nresult in Fig. 6. The uppermost and lowermost dotted lines\ndelimit the band due to the uncertainty on the astrophysical parameters for the antiproton propagation and diffusion.\nThe uppermost curve is for the minimal set of astrophysical parameters while the lowermost is for the maximal set of\nparameters. The two dash\u2013dotted lines, instead, include a pwave contribution for the annihilation in the early Universe.\nFor the upper green curve the p-wave factor is rp = 10 (see\ntext) and for the lower purple curve we have rp = 0.5. The\ndotted line which falls on top of the red solid (mean) line is\ncalculated with the Hubble enhancement function A2 (T ) with\na change in the post-freeze\u2013out temperature behaviour given\nby the parameter \u03b1 = 100.\n\nThe difference between A(T ) and A2 (T ) is that in the\nlatter case the tanh is squared and in its argument we\nhave introduced a factor \u03b1. This modification aims at\nobtaining (for large values of \u03b1) a \"re\u2013entering\" into the\nstandard regime less steep than in the previous case. This\nis illustrated in fig. 15.\nA comparison between the upper bound on \u03b7 in the\ncase of a Hubble enhancement A(T ) and A2 (T ) is shown\nagain in Fig. 14. The central blue dotted line is for A2 (T )\nwith \u03b1 = 100, Tre = 10\u22123 and \u03bd = \u22121. It can be seen\nthat this line practically falls on top of the limit (red solid\nline) derived for A(T ) (and Tre = 10\u22123 , \u03bd = \u22121). This\nresult shows that the actual shape of the enhancement\nfunction around \"re\u2013entering\" is not of major importance\nas long as the \"re\u2013entering\" occurs long after the WIMP\nfreeze out.\nLet us finally consider how the upper bound on \u03b7 is\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\nT (GeV)\n\nFIG. 15: Enhancement function A2 (T ) of Eq. (26) as a function of the temperature. Notice that time runs from right to\nleft. The solid red line has \u03bd = \u22121, the dashed green line\n\u03bd = 0, the dash-dotted blue \u03bd = 1 and the dotted purple line\nhas \u03bd = 2. We have chosen \u03b1 = 100. All other parameters are\nidentical to those of A(T ) in Fig. 1, i.e. \u03b7 = 102 , Tre = 10\u22122\nGeV and Tf = 17.3 GeV.\n\naffected by the uncertainty in the astrophysical parameters of the propagation and diffusion of the antiproton\nflux. We refer for this uncertainty to Ref. [12]. Up\nto now, we have used a set of astrophysical parameters\nwhich provides the median value of the antiproton flux\n[12]. This set of parameters is the one which best fits cosmic ray observations, mainly the B/C ratio [26]. We now\nshow in Fig. 14 the results obtained for the allowed range\nof astrophysical parameters, which give a maximal and\nminimal antiproton flux. The uppermost dotted curve in\nFig. 14 shows the result obtained using the \"minimal\"\nset of astrophysical parameters for the propagation and\ndiffusion, while the lowermost dotted curve shows the result as calculated using the \"maximal\" set. These curves\nshould be compared to the central solid curve, which is\nour previous result obtained with the best\u2013fit parameters. For all the curves we have Tre = 10\u22123 GeV and\n\u03bd = \u22121. We see that the uncertainty in the propagation function causes an uncertainty of almost one order\nof magnitude in both direction for the upper limit of \u03b7,\nas expected from the discussion in Sec. V and from the\nanalytical approximations of Eq. (25).\nFrom Fig. 14 we also see that a different choice on the\nastrophysical parameters may lead to a different lower\nlimit on the WIMP mass, as a consequence of the fact\nthat lowering the bound on the cross section (for the\nmaximal set of astrophysical parameters) causes the up-\n\n\f16\nper bound on \u03b7 to decrease. This can be seen from the\nplot of the (\u03b7, \u03bd) plane in Fig. 5. For a selection of masses\nthis shows the bound as calculated with the median propagation function. For a given mass, the region to the left\n(i.e. at smaller \u03b7) is allowed by the antiproton data as the\ncross section here is lower. Thus, when we decrease the\nupper bound on the cross section, i.e. increase the effect\nof the propagation parameters, all the bounds in Fig. 5\nwill move to smaller \u03b7 (in particular the lower masses\nwill move outside the plot). This is consistent with the\nresults of Ref. [13].\n\nVII.\n\nANTIPROTON FLUX CONSTRAINTS ON\nSOME SPECIFIC MODELS\n\nAs we discussed in the previous sections, the maximum allowed antiproton flux gives interesting model\u2013\nindependent constraints on the maximum allowed enhancement of the expansion rate at dark matter freeze\nout. Let us now discuss these constraints in connection\nto the specific cosmological models we shortly introduced\nin Section III.\n\nA.\n\nScalar-tensor theories\n\nAs mentioned in section III A, we do not have a general\nanalytical correspondence between the Hubble expansion\nrate in the scalar\u2013tensor model and our parametrization\n(5). However, the numeric example of reference [4], which\nassumes a slowly varying scalar field, can be described by\nour parametrization with \u03bd = \u22120.82 and \u03b7 = A(\u03c6(Tf )),\nwhere A(\u03c6) is the Weyl factor, which in this case gives\nthe Hubble enhancement function A(T ). From figure 6\nwe get the upper bound:\nA (\u03c6(Tf )) < O(102 )\n\nfor m\u03c7 \u2264 O(500GeV)\n\n(27)\n\nand Tf = O(10GeV). From figure 8 we can also find\nthe upper bound on A(T ) = A(\u03c6) at earlier times. We\nsee that A(\u03c6) < 10 for T > O(102 GeV) and m\u03c7 \u2264\nO(500GeV). It is interesting to observe that our results strongly constrain Fig. 5 of [4] in which it could\nseem that properly choosing the initial conditions for the\nscalar field, each enhancement for the expansion rate is\nallowed. Antiproton data limit this possibility.\n\nB.\n\nKination\n\n\u221a\nIn sec. III B we found that \u03bd = 1 and \u03b7 = \u03b7\u03a6 =\np\n\u03c1\u03a6 (Tf ) /\u03c1r (Tf ) can be used to describe the enhanced\nexpansion rate during a kination phase.\n\nWe know from Sec. VI B that \u03b7 is approximately equal\nto the WIMP density enhancement. This is in agreement\nwith the conclusions of the earlier references on kination\nand enhanced WIMP density; see e.g. Ref. [5] and Ref.\n[7]. In Ref. [7] they found that the maximal density\nenhancement compatible with the BBN bounds is of the\norder of 106 (for WIMP masses smaller than 1 TeV), i.e.\n\u03b7\u03a6 < 1012 . With our argument based on the maximum\nallowed antiproton flux we can derive a much stronger\nconstraint on this scenario. The most conservative bound\nis found for large masses. For m\u03c7 < 1TeV (and \u03bd =\n1) we have \u03b7 < O(103 ) and so \u03b7\u03a6 < 106 . While for\nlight WIMPs (m\u03c7 < O(102 GeV)) we have the much more\nstringent bound \u03b7 < 10 and so \u03b7\u03a6 < 102 .\n\nC.\n\nExtra Dimensions\n\nAs mentioned in section III C, the RSII model [11]\ngives rise to an enhanced expansion rate which can be\ndescribed by our parametrization\nwith the values of the\np\nparameters \u03bd = 2 and \u03b7 = \u03c1r (Tf ) /(2\u03bb). Where \u03bb is\nthe tension on the brane and \u03c1r is the radiation energy density. The upper bound on \u03b7 therefore gives us\na lower bound on the brane tension. The upper bound\non \u03b7 for \u03bd = 2 is shown in Fig. 6. For \u03b7 < O(102 ),\nwhich is true for WIMP masses m\u03c7 < O(102 GeV), we\nget the most stringent bound. With Tf \u2243 5 GeV and\ngeff (Tf ) \u2243 92 we find the bound \u03bb > O(1GeV4 ). A\nmore conservative bound is found for higher masses. For\nm\u03c7 = O(500 GeV) we have \u03b7 < O(104 ) and Tf \u2243 20 GeV,\nleading to \u03bb > O(10\u22122 GeV4 ). Finally, using the relation\n[25]\n\u03bb=\n\n3 M56\n2\n4\u03c0 Mpl\n\n(28)\n\nwhere Mpl is the four dimensional Plank mass and M5\nthe five dimensional one, we can derive a lower bound\non M5 . For the most stringent bound on \u03bb we get\nM5 > 3*103 TeV, while the more conservative bound just\ngive a small change, M5 > 103 TeV. We observe that the\nBBN bound is \u03bb > 1 MeV4 and so M5 > 30 TeV, [25].\nTherefore in this context, our analysis based on the antiproton flux is much more stringent than the one coming\nform the BBN constraint.\n\nVIII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe expansion rate of the Universe in the era before\nBBN is predicted to be different from the one of standard\nFRW cosmology in a host of cosmological models which\n\n\f17\nare derived either from modification of General Relativity, or from brane physics, or from attempts to provide a\nconsistent explanation to dark energy. In the present paper we concentrated on models which predict an enhancement of the expansion rate, like e.g. those discussed in\nRef. [4] where the dark energy problem finds a solution\nin a scalar\u2013tensor theory of gravity with an exponential\nrun\u2013away behaviour of a scalar field, in kination models\nlike those of Ref. [5, 6, 7, 8], in D\u2013brane models like the\nRSII model of Ref. [11] or models of modified cosmology like those in Ref. [9, 10]. These enhancements may\nbe sizeable, without evading the post\u2013BBN bounds (light\nprimordial element production, CMB anisotropies, gravitational tests) which may be applied to these cosmological models: the enhancements may reach up to four [4] or\neven six [5, 7] orders of magnitude. However, an imprint\nof this enhancement may be left on the properties of the\nparticles responsible of the dark matter. This happens\nif the enhancement of the expansion rate occurs close to\nthe time when the dark matter particles decouples from\nthe thermal bath: this possibility relies on the fact that\nthe cosmological bound on the amount of dark matter\ncan be fulfilled by particles with larger annihilation cross\nsection, as compared to standard cosmology [4, 5], due\nto an anticipated freeze\u2013out. In this situations, indirect\ndetection signals are typically enhanced, as long as the\nthermal cross section responsible of the relic abundance is\nclose to the one which determines the indirect detection\nsignals (like e.g. when the typical temperature expansion\nof the thermal cross section is applicable).\nCosmic antiprotons produced by WIMPs in the Galaxy\nare currently the best option for constraining particle\ndark matter annihilation cross sections [12, 13], since\nthey are not strongly dependent on assumptions on the\ndark matter density profile, like instead is the case of the\ngamma\u2013ray signal. Also, cosmic antiprotons produced by\nWIMPs are naturally predicted to be at the level of the\nbackground and of the data, when the WIMP accounts\nfor the CDM content of the Universe, and without invoking high degrees of over\u2013densities in the galactic neighbourhood [12]. Since the experimental data are in good\nagreement with the expected background [26, 27], not\nmuch room is left for an exotic component and therefore\nantiprotons may be used to set constraints [12, 13].\nIn this paper we exploited the effect induced on the\nantiproton signal by an increased expansion rate, to set\nbounds on the maximal enhancement of the expansion\nrate which can be allowed in the early Universe in a pre\u2013\nBBN epoch [2]. These limits apply to an evolutionary\nphase close to dark matter decoupling (i.e. at temperatures of the Universe in the range of 1\u201330 GeV, for dark\nmatter of about 10\u20131000 GeV mass) and are subject to\nthe (quite reasonable) hypothesis that dark matter is a\n\nthermal relic. The bounds we have obtained are quite\nstrong, especially for light dark matter. Our main result\nis summarized by Fig. 6. For WIMP masses lighter than\n100 GeV, the bound on the Hubble\u2013rate enhancement\nranges from a factor of a few to a factor of 30, depending\non the actual cosmological model, while for a mass of 500\nGeV the bound falls in the range 50\u2013500. These bounds\nare affected by the still large astrophysical uncertainties\nin the calculation of the antiproton signal [12], which reflects in a factor of 5 more stringent, or a factor of 10\nmore loose bounds. Nevertheless, the limits we obtain\nare much more stringent than the possible enhancement\nof these cosmological models.\n\nA caveat is in order here: whenever the effective thermal annihilation cross section in the early Universe (responsible for the relic abundance) is sizably larger than\nthe one in the galactic halo (which determines the antiproton signal) the bounds we determine are necessarily\nloosened. This occurs when coannihilation effects are\nrelevant in determining the relic abundance. In this case\nthe annihilation cross section in the Galaxy is typically\nmuch smaller than the effective one which sets the decoupling: in this case our limits still apply, but they are\nless constraining, approximately by the ratio of the two\ncross sections. We nevertheless notice that the occurrence of coannihilation is usually an accidental feature.\nAnother case where our limits are less severe is when\nWIMP annihilation occurs mostly into leptons: in this\ncase antiprotons are not produced and our bounds are\nloosened by a factor given by the branching ratio into\nnon-leptonic final states. In all other situations, which\nrepresent the most typical cases, the limits we quote are\nactually necessarily present.\n\nFinally, we applied our bounds to set constraints on\nsome specific models. In the case of the scalar\u2013tensor\ndark energy models of Ref. [4], we constrain the enhancement to be less than a factor 100 for dark matter\nlighter than 500 GeV. In the case of kination models, the\nmaximal enhancement is 1000 for WIMPs lighter than\n1 TeV, while for dark matter lighter than 100 GeV the\nenhancement must be below 10. Finally, for the Randall\u2013\nSundrum D\u2013brane model of Ref. [11], our limit may\nbe used to set bounds on the tension on the brane: for\nWIMPs lighter than 100 GeV, the string tension must be\nlarger than 1 GeV4 ; for heavier dark matter, the bound\nis 10\u22122 GeV4 . These limits reflect in a lower bound of\nabout 103 TeV on the 5\u2013dimensional Planck mass and\nare much more severe than the usual constraints derived\nfrom BBN physics.\n\n\f18\nAPPENDIX A: APPROXIMATE\nBOLTZMANN\u2013EQUATION SOLUTIONS FOR\nTHE MODIFIED HUBBLE RATE\n\nThe Boltzmann equation Eq. (12) may be easily solved\nfor a modified Hubble rate as defined in Eq. (5) by suitable approximations. We first make explicit the temperature (or x = m\u03c7 /T ) dependence in Eq. (12) by rewriting\nthe equation in the usual form:\nr\n\u03c0\ndY\nheff (x)\nm\u03c7\n2\np\nh\u03c3ann vi(Y 2 \u2212 Yeq\n)\n=\u2212\n2\ndx\n45G A (x)geff (x) x2\n(A1)\nwhere G is the Newton constant. The standard cosmology case is recovered for A(T ) = 1.\nWe first define the temperature of particle freeze\u2013out\nas the temperature Tf when:\nY (xf ) = (1 + c)Yeq (xf )\n\n(A2)\n\nwith c a constant of order 1 and Yeq (x) = 45 \u00d7\n\u22123/2\n2\u22125/2 \u03c0 \u22127/2 g h\u22121\nexp(\u2212x) is the equilibrium\neff (x) x\nabundance of a non\u2013relativistic particle with internal degree of freedom g. Condition (A2) and Eq. (A1) lead to\nthe following implicit expression for the freeze\u2013out temperature:\n#\n\"\nh\u03c3ann vixf\n2c\n(A3)\n0.038 mpl g m\u03c7 1/2\nxf = ln\n1/2\n1+c\nx A(xf ) g (xf )\nf\n\neff\n\nwhere mpl is the Planck mass. For definiteness, we use\nc = 1 throughout the paper. The standard freeze\u2013out\ntemperature is obtained when A(T ) = 1 around the time\nof particle decoupling. The models we are considering,\nwhere A(T ) > 1 at that epoch, imply a smaller xf , i.e. a\nlarger freeze\u2013out temperature Tf .\nThe current value Y0 of the comoving abundance is\nthen obtained by integrating Eq. (A1) from xf down to\nx0 \u2192 \u221e, neglecting the WIMP production term:\nr\ndY\n\u03c0\nh (x)\nm\u03c7\np eff\nh\u03c3ann viY 2\n(A4)\n=\u2212\ndx\n45G A2 (x)geff (x) x2\n\nWhen \u03bd > 0 the above approximation may not be used\nup to xre , because A(x) approaches unity as the Universe\ncools down (see Fig. 1) and therefore we cannot neglect\nthe 1 in Eq. (5). We define as x1 the temperature when\n(\u03b7 x\u03bdf ) x\u2212\u03bd \u2243 1, i.e. x1 = xf \u03b7 1/\u03bd . In this case we approximate:\n\u001a\n< x1\n(\u03b7 x\u03bdf ) x\u2212\u03bd\nx\u223c\nA(T ) \u2243\n(A7)\n1\nBelow xre , in any case A(T ) = 1 by definition.\nWith these approximations, the solution of Eq. (A5)\nfor a temperature\u2013independent annihilation cross section\nh\u03c3ann vi = a is:\n1\n1\n=\nY0\nYeq (xf )\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n+ B m\u03c7 a G(xf ) I(xf , x\u0302, \u03b7, \u03bd) + rG\nx\u0302\nwhere x\u0302 = min[x1 , xre ] and rG = G(x\u0302)/G(xf ) is typically\naround 0.5\u20131 for WIMPs masses in the range GeV\u2013TeV.\nFor large enhancements (\u03b7 \u226b 1) and a low re\u2013entering\ntemperature, typically: x\u0302 = x1 for \u03bd > 0 and x\u0302 = xre for\n\u03bd < 0. In Eq. (A8) we have assumed a slowly\u2013varying\nG(x) in the integrals.\nIn our discussion in the text, typically the relevant\nterm in Eq. (A8) is the one which contains the function I(xf , x\u0302, \u03b7, \u03bd): the other two terms may be usually\nneglected to a few percent level of approximation. This\nrelevant function is easily found to be:\nI=\n\n1\n1\n=\n+ B m\u03c7\nY0\nYeq (xf )\n\n(A9)\n\n1\n1\n1 \u2212 \u03bd xf \u03b7\n\n(A10)\n\n1 ln(\u03b7)\nxf \u03b7\n\n(A11)\n\nI=\nfor \u03bd < 1 and finally\n\nI=\n\n\u221e\n\nG(x) h\u03c3ann vi\ndx\n(A5)\nA(x) x2\nxf\np\nwhere B = (\u03c0/45G)1/2 and G(x) = heff (x)/ geff (x).\nThe WIMP relic abundance is then obtained by means\nof Eq. (13).\nFor large enhancements of the Hubble rate around the\nWIMP freeze\u2013out, i.e. for large values of the parameter\n\u03b7, we may approximate A(T ) as a power\u2013law function\nwith exponent \u03bd. If \u03bd < 0, we may assume this behaviour\nall the way down to the re\u2013entering temperature xre :\n\u0012 \u0013\u03bd\nT\nA(T ) \u2243 \u03b7\n= (\u03b7 x\u03bdf ) x\u2212\u03bd\n(A6)\nTf\n\n1\n1\n\u03bd \u2212 1 xf \u03b7 1/\u03bd\n\nfor \u03bd > 1, then\n\nwhich gives the solution:\n\nZ\n\n(A8)\n\nfor \u03bd = 1 (kination).\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe acknowledge Research Grants funded jointly by the\nItalian Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universit\u00e0 e della\nRicerca (MIUR), by the University of Torino and by the\nIstituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN) within the\nAstroparticle Physics Project.

This\nis the case we shall focus on mainly in this paper. In\nSec.VI C we study a temperature dependent cross section.\n[42] Note that models that have the same WIMP mass and\ncross section would have identical relic abundance in\nstandard cosmology. Here, however, we are interested in\nthe relic abundance in a cosmology with enhanced Hubble rate, and this abundance does depend also on the\nparameters \u03b7 and \u03bd.\n\n\f"}
