The contribution of ordered rotation to the observed tilt and thickness of the Fundamental Plane of\nelliptical galaxies is studied by means of oblate, two-integrals cuspy galaxy models with adjustable flattening,\nvariable amount of ordered rotational support, and possible presence of a dark matter halo and of a central supermassive black hole. We find that, when restricting the measure of the velocity dispersion to the central galactic\nregions, rotation has a negligible effect, and so cannot be responsible of the observed tilt. However, streaming\nvelocity effect can be significant when observing small and rotationally supported galaxies through large (relative)\naperture (as for example in Fundamental Plane studies at high redshift), and can lead to unrealistically low massto-light ratios. The effect of a central supermassive black hole on the kinematical fields, and the models position\nin the v/\u03c3-ellipticity plane are also discussed.\nKey words.

Introduction\nIn the observational three-dimensional space of central\nvelocity dispersion \u03c30 , (circularized) effective radius Re ,\nand mean surface brightness within the effective radius\nIe = L/(2\u03c0Re2 ) (where L is the total galaxy luminosity),\nearly-type galaxies approximately locate on a plane, called\nthe Fundamental Plane (hereafter FP; Dressler et al. 1987;\nDjorgovski & Davis 1987), and represented by the best-fit\nrelation:\nlog Re = a log \u03c30 + b log Ie + c.\n\n(1)\n\nThe coefficients a, b, and c depend slightly on the considered photometric band (e.g., Pahre, de Carvalho, &\nDjorgovski, 1998; Scodeggio et al. 1998): for example, by\nmeasuring Re in kpc, \u03c30 in km/s, and Ie in L\u2299 /pc2 , reported values in the Gunn r band are a = 1.24 \u00b1 0.07,\nb = \u22120.82 \u00b1 0.02, c = 0.1821 (J\u00f8rgensen, Franx, &\nKjaergaard 1996, hereafter JFK). One of the most striking\nobservational properties of the FP is its small and nearly\nSend offprint requests to: andrea.riciputi@bo.astro.it\n1\nThis value of c refers to the Coma cluster and to H0 = 50\nkm s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . Note that \u03c30 is usually corrected to a circular\naperture with diameter 1.19 h\u22121 kpc, corresponding to a radial\nrange \u223c 0.05 Re \u2013Re for h = 0.5, and for typical values of Re\n(e.g., J\u00f8rgensen, Franx, & Kjaergaard 1995).\n\nconstant thickness: the distribution of log Re around the\nbest-fit FP (at fixed \u03c30 and Ie ) has a measured rms (hereafter \u03c3int ) corresponding to a scatter in Re \u223c 15% \u00f7 20%\n(after correction for measurement errors, see, e.g., Faber\net al. 1987; JFK).\nIn addition, for a stationary stellar system the scalar\nvirial theorem can be written as\nG\u03a5\u2217 L\n= KV \u03c302 ,\n(2)\nRe\nwhere \u03a5\u2217 is the stellar mass-to-light ratio in the photometric band used for the determination of L and Re , while\nthe coefficient KV takes into account projection effects,\nthe galaxy stellar density distribution, the stellar orbital\ndistribution (such as velocity dispersion anisotropy and\nrotational support), and the effects related to the presence of dark matter. Equations (1) and (2) imply that\nin real galaxies, no matter how complex their structure\nis, \u03a5\u2217 /KV is a well-defined function of any two of the\nthree observables (L, Re , \u03c30 ) and this dependence is commonly referred as the \"FP tilt\". In other words, the FP\ntilt indicates that structural/dynamical (KV ) and stellar\npopulation (\u03a5\u2217 ) properties in real galaxies are strictly\nconnected, possibly as a consequence of their formation\nprocess. Overall, the interpretation of the FP cannot be\nlimited to the study of its tilt only, but requires to take\n\n\f2\n\nRiciputi et al.: Rotational effects on the FP thickness\n\nconsistently into account also its thinness (as done, for\nexample, in the \"orthogonal exploration\" approach, see\nRenzini & Ciotti 1993, Ciotti, Lanzoni & Renzini 1996,\nCiotti & Lanzoni 1997). A step forward in the study\nof the structural and dynamical implications of the tilt\nand thinness of the FP was made by Bertin, Ciotti &\nDel Principe (2002), who introduced, although limited\nto spherical models, the more general Monte-Carlo approach. The Monte-Carlo approach was successively applied by Lanzoni & Ciotti (2003, hereafter LC) to the\ninvestigation of projection effects on the FP thickness,\nby adopting fully analytical axisymmetric one-component\nFerrers galaxy models (Ferrers 1877). In particular, LC\nfound that while projection effects do contribute to the\nobserved FP scatter, nonetheless the FP physical scatter\n(as determined by variations of the physical properties\nfrom galaxy to galaxy), sums up to 90% of the intrinsic\nFP scatter. In addition, LC found that the contribution\nof ordered streaming motions to the observed velocity dispersion is negligible when small/medium apertures (<\n\u223c Re )\nare used for the spectroscopic observations. Unfortunately,\nwhile fully reliable about projection effects on Re (which\nare independent of the specific homeoidal density profile\nadopted), the central regions of Ferrers models are unrealistically flat, so that doubts can be risen about the use\nof their central velocity dispersion to estimate streaming\nvelocity effects. Moreover, what is the additional effect of\na central super-massive black hole (SMBH) or of a dark\nmatter halo? An attempt to answer the questions above\nwas made by Ciotti & Bertin (2005, hereafter CB) by using fully analytical cuspy galaxy models obtained from a\nhomeoidal expansion, qualitatively confirming the results\nof LC. Here, in order to extend the results of LC and CB,\nwe numerically solve the Jeans and projected dynamics\nequations for more realistic, oblate galaxy models with a\ncentral cusp, and variable amount of internal streaming\nvelocity, allowing for the presence of a central SMBH and\na dark matter halo.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we derive the relevant intrinsic and projected properties of the\nadopted models, while in Sects. 3, 4 and 5 we present the\nmain results of our analysis together with some observationally related consequences, such as the model position\nin the v/\u03c3-ellipticity plane. In Sect. 6 we summarize the\nresults, while in the Appendix we present the fully analytical model adopted to test the numerical code.\n\n1993; Dehnen & Gerhard 1994, hereafter DG; Tremaine\net al. 1994; Qian et al. 1995). Their density profile is\n\u03c1\u2217 =\n\n2.1. 3D quantities\nAt variance with LC, who adopted the centrally flat\nand spatially truncated Ferrers model, we now use cuspy\noblate galaxy models with homeoidal density distribution,\nbelonging to the family of the so-called \u03b3-models (Dehnen\n\n(0 \u2264 \u03b3 < 3),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere M\u2217 is the total mass, Rc the characteristic\nscale,\nq\n2\n2\n2\n2\nand in cylindrical coordinates m \u2261 R\u0303 + z\u0303 /q , with\n\nR\u0303 \u2261 R/Rc and z\u0303 \u2261 z/Rc ; the parameter 0 < q \u2264 1 measures the intrinsic model flattening. Note that these models for \u03b3 \u2243 0.75 and \u03b3 \u2243 1 provide a good representation\n(in the central regions) of the de Vaucouleurs (1948) and\nof the Navarro, Frenk, & White (1997) profiles, respectively. In two-component models the dark matter halo is\nalso described by a density profile as in Eq. (3), in general\nwith a different total mass, scale-radius, density slope and\nflattening; a SMBH of mass MBH can be also added at the\nmodel center. In all cases, the stellar mass-to-light ratio\n\u03a5\u2217 is assumed to be constant within each model.\nWe assume that the density profile in Eq. (3) is supported by a two-integrals distribution function f (E, Lz )3\n(where E and Lz are the energy and the z-component\nof the angular momentum of stars per unit mass, respectively), and the Jeans equations are\n2\n\u2202\u03c1\u2217 \u03c3R\n\u2202\u03c6\n= \u2212\u03c1\u2217 ,\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c1\n(v\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c1\u2217 \u03c3R\n\u2217 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c3R )\n\u2212\n= \u2212\u03c1\u2217\n,\n\u2202R\nR\n\u2202R\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the total gravitational potential, vR = vz = 0,\nthe off-diagonal elements of the velocity dispersion tensor\n2\nvanish, and \u03c3R\n= \u03c3z2 (see, e.g., Binney & Tremaine 1987,\nhereafter BT).\n2 is splitted into streaming motion v 2 \u2261 v2\nAs in LC, v\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n2\u2212\nand azimuthal velocity dispersion \u03c3\u03c62 \u2261 (v\u03c6 \u2212 v\u03c6 )2 = v\u03c6\nv\u03c62 with the Satoh (1980) k-decomposition:\n2 \u2212 \u03c3 2 ),\nv\u03c62 = k 2 (v\u03c6\nR\n\n(6)\n\nand\n2\n2 \u2212 \u03c3 2 ),\n\u03c3\u03c62 = \u03c3R\n+ (1 \u2212 k 2 )(v\u03c6\nR\n\n(7)\n\nwith 0 \u2264 k \u2264 1. For k = 0 no ordered motions are present,\nand the velocity dispersion tensor is maximally tangentially anisotropic, while for k = 1 the velocity dispersion\ntensor is isotropic, and the galaxy flattening is due to azimuthal streaming velocity (the so-called \"isotropic rotator\" case).\n2\n\n2.

(3) cannot be expressed in terms\nof elementary functions, and so we compute it by using\nan expansion in orthogonal function: Eqs. (4) and (5) are\nthen integrated numerically (Sect. 2.3).\n\n2.2. Projected quantities\nIn order to project the model properties on the plane of\nthe sky (the projection plane), we define the observer system as a Cartesian coordinate system (x\u2032, y\u2032, z\u2032) with the\nline-of-sight (los) parallel to the z\u2032 axis, and with the x\u2032\naxis coincident with the x axis of the natural Cartesian\nsystem introduced in Sect. 2.1. The angle between z and\nz\u2032 is 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0/2: \u03b8 = 0 corresponds to the face-on\nview of the galaxy, while \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 to the edge-on view.\nWith this choice, the projection plane is (x\u2032, y\u2032) and the\nlos direction in the natural coordinate system is given by\nn = (0, \u2212 sin \u03b8, cos \u03b8)4 . Following LC we indicate with \u03a3(l)\nthe projected (mass or light) density distribution, where\n\u001a 2\nl \u2261 x\u20322 + y\u20322 /q(\u03b8)2 ,\n(8)\nq(\u03b8)2 \u2261 cos2 \u03b8 + q 2 sin2 \u03b8.\nThe quantity l determines the size of the elliptic isophotes,\nand their ellipticity is given by \u03b5 = 1 \u2212 q(\u03b8). For fixed l\nthe major and minor isophotal semi-axes are a = l and\nb = q(\u03b8)l, and the associated p\ncircularized radius is defined as \u03c0Rl2 = \u03c0ab, i.e., Rl = q(\u03b8)l. In particular, the\ncircularized effective radius is\np\n(9)\nRe = q(\u03b8)le ,\nwhere Mp (le ) = M/2, with Mp (l) being\np the projected\nmass within l. Thus the identity Re = q(\u03b8)Re0 (where\nRe0 the effective radius of the model when seen face\u2013on or\nin case of spherical symmetry) is a common property of\nall axisymmetric homeoidal distributions, independently\nof their specific density profile, and so the dependence on\n\u03b8 of the circularized effective radius of the present models\nand those in LC is identical.\nThe projected velocity fields at (x\u2032, y\u2032) are obtained\nby numerical integration of the projection along n of their\nspatial counterpart. This is done by transforming the corresponding spatial velocity moments from cylindrical to\nCartesian coordinates (LC, Eqs. [21]-[27]). Note that, in\npresence of a non-zero projected streaming velocity field\nvp , the velocity dispersion accessible to observation is\nZ \u221e\n1\n2\n\u03c3los (x\u2032, y\u2032) \u2261\n\u03c1 (hv, ni \u2212 vp )2 dz\u2032 =\n\u03a3(l) \u2212\u221e\n= \u03c3p2 + Vp2 \u2212 vp2 ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere h, i is the standard inner product, and for the definition of Vp2 (the los integration of vn2 , i.e. the squared\n4\n\nThe los vector points toward the observer, and so positive\nvelocities correspond to a blue\u2013shift; the general framework for\nthe projection is given in LC.\n\n3\n\ncomponent along n of the streaming velocity field) and of\n\u03c3p2 we again refer to LC. Note also that, independently of\nthe los orientation, vn = 0 on the isophotal minor axis y\u2032,\n2\n2\nand thus \u03c3los\n= \u03c3p2 there. In addition, \u03c3los\n= \u03c3p2 everywhere when observing the galaxy face-on (\u03b8 = 0), or in\nthe case k = 0 (no rotation). Finally, since the observed\nvelocity dispersion is always measured within the aper2\nture of the spectrograph, we integrate \u03c3los\nover circular\napertures of radius Ra :\nZ\n2\n2\n\u03a3(x\u2032, y\u2032)\u03c3los\n(x\u2032, y\u2032) dx\u2032 dy\u2032.

The numerical code\nThe solution of the Jeans equations and the projection of\nthe density and of the various kinematical quantities are\ncalculated with a grid-based numerical code developed by\none of us (A.R.). The gravitational potential is obtained\nby solving the Poisson equation \u22072 \u03c6 = 4\u03c0G\u03c1 in spherical\ncoordinates (r, \u03b8, \u03c6), specializing the Londrillo & Messina\n(1990) spectral method to axisymmetric systems. The \u03b8\n(co-latitude) dependence of \u03c1 and \u03c6 is described with standard Legendre polynomials, while the spherical radius is\nmapped as\nr \u2261 tan2 (u/2) ,\n\n(0 \u2264 u \u2264 \u03c0).\n\n(12)\n\nThe resulting radial u-Laplace operator, when acting on\nChebyshev polynomials Tn (cos u), originates a finite linear\ncombination of such orthogonal functions, used to expand\nthe density and the gravitational potential. Equations (4)\nand (5) are then integrated with a cubic spline algorithm\non a logarithmic (R, z) grid, in order to sample the model\ncentral regions at high resolution (as required by the density cusp and by the possible presence of a SMBH). Since\nthe projection coordinate system is tilted with respect to\nthe natural coordinate system by an angle \u03b8, the grid\npoints of the two systems in general do not coincide, and\nso an interpolation and the los integrations are performed\nwith a cubic spline algorithm. For obvious symmetry reasons, the computations are restricted to the first quadrant.\nThe double precision C code is organized in a library of\nfunctions, and all the relevant intrinsic and projected fields\nof each model are computed in \u223c 100 s on a 1.33GHz processor, for a 5123 grid. The code accuracy has been tested\nby solving the Poisson, Jeans, and projected equations\nfor the Miyamoto-Nagai (1975) models (see also Ciotti\n& Pellegrini 1996), for the spherical \u03b3-models, and for the\nFerrers ellipsoids: for these models all the relevant dynamical properties and, to some extent, even the projected\nfields are known analytically. In addition, we also compared our numerical results with the analytical (asymptotic) models presented in the Appendix and in CB, ob\u22123\ntaining relative errors <\n\u223c 10 for the intrinsic dynamical\n\u22122\n<\nproperties and \u223c10 for the projected fields (also in the\n\n\f4\n\nRiciputi et al.: Rotational effects on the FP thickness\n\ncentral regions and in presence of a SMBH). Finally, for\nall models presented in the following section we verify numerically the projected virial theorem\n2\n2\n2\n\u2212 n22 W22\n\u2212 n23 W33\n,\n2ni nj Kij = \u2212n21 W11\n\n(13)\n\nwith Kij and Wij being the kinetic and potential energy\ntensors (e.g. Ciotti 2000, see also Eqs. [31], [A.8], [A.11],\n[A.12] in LC).\n\n3. General results\nBefore studying in detail the effect of ordered rotation on\nthe measured velocity dispersion in elliptical galaxies and\nits consequences on the FP, we present a few representative models in order to illustrate the general properties of\ntheir projected kinematical fields (see also DG). In particular, since ordered rotation enters in the definition of\n\u03c3 2 through the quantities vp and Vp (Eq. [10] and [11]),\nand since these quantities are maximized for isotropic rotators seen edge-on, we restrict to this configuration in the\nfollowing discussion.\nIn Fig. 1 (top left panel) we show vp along the major axis for three different values of the galaxy density\ninner slope (\u03b3 = 0, 1, 1.5) and two different flattenings\n(q = 0.3, 0.8) in one-component isotropic models without central SMBH. Consistently with Eqs. (A.5) and (6),\nand with CB (Eq. [C.8]), in central regions vp vanishes in\nall the considered cases. The projected streaming velocity\nalso vanishes independently of \u03b3, as R \u2192 \u221e, where the\ndensity profile \u221d m\u22124 . The major axis projected streaming velocity thus presents a rapid increase up to a maximum, placed very near to the model circularized effective radius, followed by a mild decrease for increasing radial coordinate (note the logarithmic scale of the x-axis).\nApparently, at fixed galaxy mass and scale-length, the\nmain parameters determining the projected velocity vp\nare the galaxy flattening q, and the slope \u03b3 of the central\ncusp. In Fig. 1 (top right panel) we show the aperture velocity dispersion \u03c3a for the same models (with q = 0.3) in\nthe left panel, either supported by tangential anisotropy\n(k = 0, solid line), or by ordered rotation (k = 1, dashed\nline). In general, \u03c3a is larger for k = 0 than for k = 1\nat any fixed aperture, and this is so because tangential\nanisotropy is maximal when k = 0, while the streaming\nmotions (that are maximal for k = 1) contribute to \u03c3los\nwith the term Vp2 \u2212 vp2 which is small (see Eq. [10]). This\ndependence of \u03c3a on k is explicit in Eq. (29) in CB. In\nany case, also \u03c3a presents a maximum, which is near Re /8\nfor the isotropic rotators, and near Re for non-rotating\nmodels.\nAn important quantitative result of our models is that\n\u03c3a differs less than 15% between the non-rotating and\nmaximally rotating cases, when Ra <\n\u223cRe /8 since vp and\nVp vanish near the galaxy center. When integrating \u03c3los\nover a larger area (Ra \u223c Re ), however, the differences\nbetween \u03c3a of the anisotropy-supported and the rotationsupported models increase for increasing \u03b3, attaining a\nvalue of about 30% in the most extreme case (\u03b3 = 1.5).\n\nIn Fig. 1 (bottom panels) we show the same quantities\nof the corresponding upper panels, for identical galaxy\nmodels at which we added a spherically symmetric (qh =\n1) dark matter halo with Mh = 5M\u2217 and Rh = 2Rc .\nFor the halo central cusp we adopted \u03b3 = 1, in order to\nmimic the central behavior of the NFW density profile.\nQualitatively the results are similar to those of the onecomponent models, the main effect being the substantial\nincrease of \u03c3a for large apertures in the k = 0 case. Note\nalso that in the central regions the effect of the adopted\ndark matter halo is negligible, as revealed by Eqs. (A.4)(A.5) with MBH = 0. Analogous results are obtained also\nwith halos with different mass or scale radius.\nCompared to the observations (e.g., Mehlert et al.\n2000), while the model rotational velocity profiles are\nquite realistic, the aperture velocity dispersion presents\na central dip that seems at odd with what empirically inferred from the data (e.g., J\u00f8rgensen et al. 1995; Mehlert\net al. 2003; Cappellari et al. 2005). This is an unrealistic,\nbut very well known, feature of several dynamical models with cuspy density distributions, which produce centrally vanishing velocity dispersion profiles (see Eq.[A.4];\ne.g., Bailey & MacDonald 1981; Dehnen 1993; Tremaine\net al. 1994; and Bertin et al. 2002 for a general discussion in the case of spherical symmetry). Such a central\ndip in the models often occurs at small radii, so that it\nis undetectable in the data or it nicely agrees with few\nobserved cases (e.g., Graham et al. 1998; Emsellem et al.\n2004; Cappellari et al. 2005). This is also what we find\nfor our isotropic rotators, but cannot apply to the case of\nnon-rotating models, which show a peak in the los velocity\ndispersion profile well far from the galaxy center, near the\neffective radius. However, we stress again that here we are\nconsidering the most extreme (thus also possibly unrealistic) cases, in order to maximize the effects of ordered rotation, while these unobserved features become much weaker\nfor milder flattenings, intermediate los inclinations, and\nnon-zero rotational support. We therefore consider our results reliable and conclude that the contribution of the\nrotational velocity to the observed central velocity dispersion (Ra <\n\u223cRe /8) is usually negligible for elliptical galaxies\nin the local Universe, also in presence of a cuspy dark matter halo. This implies, that a systematic increase of rotational support with decreasing galaxy luminosity is not at\nthe origin of the tilt of the FP of elliptical galaxies (see also\nBusarello et al. 1997, LC). However, our results also suggest that particular care should be used when constructing\nthe FP of galaxies at high redshift (where spectroscopic\napertures usually enclose a large fraction of the galaxy). In\nfact, the increasing difference of \u03c3a between rotating and\nnon rotating galaxies, with increasing Ra (dashed line in\nFig. 1) would lead, if not properly taken into account, to\nunderestimate the galaxy mass (when interpreting \u03c3a by\nmeans of virial estimators based on spherical, not rotating\nmodels) up to 70% for low-mass and rotating objects (see\nalso Bender, Burstein & Faber 1992, van Albada, Bertin &\nStiavelli 1995). These aperture effects might so contribute\n(in part) to the observed decrease of the mass-to-light ra-\n\n\fRiciputi et al.: Rotational effects on the FP thickness\n\n5\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b3 = 1.5\n\u03b3 = 1.0\n\u03b3 = 0.0\n\n0.4\n\nq = 0.3\n\nk = 0.0\nk = 1.0\n\n0.3\nq = 0.3\n0.2\n\np\n\u03c3a / GM\u2217 /Rc\n\np\nvp / GM\u2217 /Rc\n\n\u03b3 = 1.5\n0.3\n\u03b3 = 1.0\n0.2\n0.1\n\n\u03b3 = 0.0\nq = 0.8\n\n0\n\n0.1\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\nR/Rc\n\n1\n\n10\n\nRa /Rc\n\n0.8\n\u03b3\u2217 = 1.5\n\u03b3\u2217 = 1.0\n\u03b3\u2217 = 0.0\n\n0.6\n\nq\u2217 = 0.3\n\nk = 0.0\nk = 1.0\n\n0.6\np\n\u03c3a / GM\u2217 /Rc\n\np\nvp / GM\u2217 /Rc\n\nq\u2217 = 0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\u03b3\u2217 = 1.5\n\n0.2\nq\u2217 = 0.8\n0\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\nR/Rc\n\n0.3 \u03b3\u2217 = 0.0\n\u03b3\u2217 = 1.0\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\nRa /Rc\n\nFig. 1.

Effects of a central super-massive black hole\nIt is now commonly accepted that SMBHs reside in the\ncenter of stellar spheroids, and that their mass MBH scales\nalmost linearly with the stellar mass of the parent galaxy,\nwith MBH /M\u2217 \u2248 10\u22123 (Magorrian et al. 1998). An order-\n\nof-magnitude estimate of the radius rBH of the \"sphere of\ninfluence\" (i.e., the region within which the gravitational\neffects of the SMBH on the stellar orbits are significant) is\nusually obtained as GMBH /rBH = 3 \u03c3\u22172 /2 \u2248 GM\u2217 /(2 rvir ),\ni.e., rBH /Re \u2248 6 \u00d7 10\u22123 (where \u03c3\u2217 is the one-dimensional\nstellar velocity dispersion, and rvir /Re \u2243 2.97 for a R1/4\ngalaxy; see Ciotti 1991). Thus, SMBH effects should be detectable on scales of few parsecs or tens of parsecs only, in\nany case well within the standard central aperture of Re /8.\nHowever, while in galaxy models without SMBH v\u03c6 and\n\n\f6\n\nRiciputi et al.: Rotational effects on the FP thickness\n\n6\n\n2.2\n\nv\u03c6BH /v\u03c6\nvpBH /vp\n\n2\nVelocity dispersion ratio\n\nVelocity ratio\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n\u03c3RBH /\u03c3R\nBH\n\u03c3los\n/\u03c3los\n\u03c3aBH /\u03c3a\n\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n\n1\n0.01\n\n0.1\nR/Rc\n\n1\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\nR/Rc\n\n1\n\nFig. 2.

The results obtained\nwith our models are illustrated in Fig. 2 (left panel), where\nwe show the spatial and projected streaming velocity along\nthe major axis of an isotropic \u03b3 = 1 model with q = 0.3\nand with a central SMBH having MBH /M\u2217 = 10\u22123 . It\ncan be seen that while v\u03c6 increases by nearly one order\nof magnitude in the innermost regions, vp (the only one\ndirectly accessible to observations) is much less affected\nby the presence of the SMBH. Note that from Eq. (A.5),\nand CB (Eq. [C.8]), v\u03c6BH /v\u03c6 \u221d vpBH /vp \u221d R(\u03b3\u22123)/2 . In\nall explored models we found that the SMBH influence is\nnegligible for R>\n\u223cRe /8.\nIn Fig. 2 (right panel) we show for the same model\nthe intrinsic one-dimensional and los velocity dispersions along the major axis, and the aperture velocity dispersion as a function of Ra . Note that from Eq. (A.4)\nBH\nand Eqs. (C.3), (29)-(30) of CB we expect \u03c3R\n/\u03c3R \u221d\nBH\nBH\n(\u03b3\u22123)/2\n\u03c3los /\u03c3los \u221d \u03c3a /\u03c3a \u221d R\n. In fact, our numerical\nresults confirm this radial trend, and also show that the\nSMBH influence decreases along the sequence \u03c3z , \u03c3los and\n\u03c3a at fixed radial coordinate. A comparison of the two\npanels in Fig. 2 shows that velocity dispersions are less\naffected than rotational velocities by the presence of a\ncentral SMBH. We thus conclude, that, in general, the\npresence of a SMBH can be neglected when using the\nmeasured \"central\" (Ra \u2243 Re /8) velocity dispersion, for\nthe construction of the Faber-Jackson (1976), FP, and\nMBH -\u03c3 relations (Ferrarese & Merritt 2000, Gebhardt et\n\nal. 2000), as well as the v/\u03c3-ellipticity plane (Illingworth\n1977, Binney 1978). Accordingly, in the following Sections\nwe will not consider a central black hole in the models.\n\n4. Contribution of rotational velocity to the FP\nthickness\nIn a follow-up of LC we now investigate the contribution of\nprojection and ordered rotation on the observed FP thickness. As anticipated in the Introduction, the only differences with respect to the results of LC are possibly due to\nthe new value of \u03c30 , since the variations of the circularized\neffective radius Re (and of Ie ) are independent of the specific stellar density profile adopted (provided it is stratified\non similar ellipsoids). We start by illustrating how models\n\"move\" in the edge-on view of the FP as a function of\ntheir intrinsic (\u03b3, q, k) and observational (\u03b8) parameters.\nIn Fig. 3 (left panel) we show the edge-on view of the FP\nof Coma cluster ellipticals as given by Eq. (1) (solid line),\nand its rms scatter \u2243 0.057 (dashed line, as obtained by\nJFK for galaxies with \u03c30 \u2265 100 km/s, and after correction for measurement errors). The three families of models superimposed are determined (from top to bottom)\nby (q, k) = (0.3, 0), (0.3, 1), and (0.6, 1). For simplicity,\n\u03b3 = 1 in all models, while three different aperture radii\nRa are considered to measure \u03c30 = \u03c3a , namely Ra = Re /8\n(dots), Re (squares), 10 Re (triangles). The cases corresponding to \u03b8 = 0 and Ra = Re are arbitrarily placed on\nthe FP best-fit line, and the displacements correspond to\n\u03b8 increasing from 0 to \u03c0/2. According to Eq. (8), when\nthe los inclination changes from 0 to \u03c0/2, Re decreases\n\n\fRiciputi et al.: Rotational effects on the FP thickness\n\n(and Ie increases), thus producing a vertical down-shifts\ntowards the left of the representative models; as expected,\ndisplacements are smaller for rounder systems. The additional effect of rotational velocity produces horizontal\ndisplacements which depend mainly on the adopted Ra .\nFor k = 1 (isotropic rotators), the variation of \u03c3a with the\nviewing angle \u03b8 is only slightly dependent on the considered spectroscopic aperture, so that the model displacements are almost parallel to each other, but not to the\nFP. On the contrary, the displacements of non-rotating\nanisotropic galaxies change considerably both in magnitude and direction as function of Ra . We have verified\nthat these results are almost independent of the model\ncentral cusp \u03b3. Thus, due to projection effects, galaxies\nmove in directions which are not exactly parallel to the\nedge-on FP, but the entity of these displacements is small\nenough to always maintain the models within the observed\nFP thickness. A comparison with Fig. 5 in LC reveals remarkably similar behaviors.\nWe now restrict the analysis to rotational effects as\na function of density slope and galaxy flattening, and in\nFig. 3 (right panel) we plot a selection of representative\nmodels. As in the left panel, we consider the edge-on view\nof the FP, and we describe how models \"move\" when varying the relative amount of rotational and anisotropy support. In particular we show the behavior of three families\nof models seen edge-on, with different central cusp slopes\n(\u03b3 = 0, 1, 1.5), and with different flattening q. Isotropic\nmodels (k = 1) are arbitrarily placed on the FP best-fit\nline. A reduction of the amount of rotational support to\nzero \"moves\" models toward the right, placing them at the\nintermediate points, corresponding to k = 0 and q = 0.6.\nMore flattened models move even further, until the rightmost points, that represent models with k = 0 and q = 0.3.\nThese displacements are due to the increasing values of\nthe central velocity dispersion \u03c30 as the rotational support becomes negligible, and their amount increases with\nboth the aperture radius and the galaxy flattening, while\nit is almost independent of the shape of the central cusp \u03b3,\nin agreement with Fig. 1. Note that a preliminary analysis\nof this problem was given by CB, who adopted homeoidal\nexpansion to investigate the behavior of the projected velocity dispersion in cuspy oblate models with a central\nSMBH. A comparison of our results with Fig. 2 of CB\nand results discussed therein, reveals very similar behaviors. Note that the models showed in Fig. 3 (right panel)\nare all observed edge-on, in order to maximize the rotation\neffect; when all the possible line-of-sight and the distribution of intrinsic ellipticities are taken into account (as in\nthe Monte-Carlo approach in LC) the statistical displacements would be essentially negligible.\nFrom the study of the models presented in this Section,\nand from their comparison with models in LC and CB we\nthen confirm and extend the conclusions of LC to cuspy\ngalaxies, i.e. that projection effects only marginally contribute to the FP thickness, 90% of it being due to variations, from galaxy to galaxy, of their intrinsic physical\nproperties. In particular, we proved that variations of ro-\n\n7\n\ntational support from galaxy to galaxy only marginally\ncontribute to the FP thickness.\n\n5. The v/\u03c3-ellipticity plane\nWith the aid of the developed models we finally study\nhow the v/\u03c3-ellipticity plane (an important tool used to\ninvestigate to what extent the galaxy flattening is due to\nvelocity dispersion anisotropy, e.g. see Illingworth 1977,\nBinney 1978) is populated by galaxies as a function of\nthe adopted aperture Ra and of their streaming velocity support. Traditionally, observational data are the peak\nprojected streaming velocity vp,max a \"central\" aperture\nvelocity dispersion \u03c30 , and galaxy ellipticity. Data points\nare then compared with the family of curves obtained from\nthe tensor virial theorem, where v 2 and \u03c3 2 are the mass\nweighted square streaming velocity and velocity dispersion computed over the whole galaxy. As well known, the\ntensor virial theorem predictions are independent of the\nspecific galaxy density profile as far as it is homeoidally\nstratified (Roberts 1962). For example, the thick solid line\nI in Fig. 4 is obtained from Eq. (4.95) of BT (see also\nEq. [9] of Binney 2005), and corresponds to isotropic rotators seen edge-on. Galaxies whose representative points\nlie significantly below this curve are considered anisotropy\nsupported. Unfortunately it is not straightforward to connect the virial quantities to the observable ones. For this\nreason, the tensor virial theorem curves are often \"corrected\" to take into account projection effects, and in\ngeneral these corrections makes curve I flatter (e.g., see\nEq. [4.5] and Figs. [8]-[9] in Evans & de Zeeuw 1994, and\nFigs. [4.5]-[4.6] in BT). The situation became even more\ncomplicate when Evans & de Zeeuw (1994) showed that\nv/\u03c3 for their nearly isotropic \"power-law\" galaxy models, not only was systematically below curve I of classical\nspheroids (and significantly so at large ellipticities), but\nalso below the \"corrected\" locus. Of course, this behavior is not unexpected because, as discussed by Evans &\nde Zeeuw (1994), the density of their model is not stratified on ellipsoidal surfaces. In addition, their projected\nstreaming velocity does not have a maximum, and its fiducial value must therefore be taken at some arbitrary distance from the center. Interestingly, a very similar behavior is also shown by the isotropic models described in CB\n(Fig. [2]): in this case, due to the models scale-free nature, vp and \u03c3a adopted to construct v/\u03c3 were taken at\nthe same radius.\nFortunately, it is now possible to observationally map\nthe rotation speed and the velocity dispersion over a substantial fraction of a galaxy's image (e.g. the SAURON\nproject, see de Zeeuw et al. 2002, Cappellari et al. 2005).\nThus, one can use the sky-averaged quantities to define\nv/\u03c3, and predict its trend from the projected virial theorem (e.g. Binney 2005, see also Ciotti 1994, 2000). Curve\nII in Fig. 4 shows the corresponding locus of the edge-on\nisotropic rotators, as given by Binney (2005).\nHere we use our (isotropic, edge-on, and homeoidally\nstratified) models to study the effects of light profile cen-\n\n\f8\n\nRiciputi et al.: Rotational effects on the FP thickness\n\n1.4\nedge-on models\n\n1.4\n1.2\nq = 0.3, k = 0.0\n\n1.2\n\n\u03b3 = 1.5\n\n1\n\nq = 0.3, k = 1.0\n0.6\n\nlog Re\n\nlog Re\n\n1\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n\u03b3 = 1.0\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\nq = 0.6, k = 1.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\nRe /8\nRe\n10Re\n\n\u03b3 = 0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\nRe /8\nRe\n10 Re\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n1.24 log \u03c30 \u2212 0.82 log Ie + 0.182\n\n1.4\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4 0.6 0.8\n1\n1.2 1.4\n1.24 log \u03c30 \u2212 0.82 log Ie + 0.182\n\nFig. 3.

For each model three spectroscopic apertures for \u03c3a = \u03c30 are considered (Re /8: dots, Re :\nsquare, 10Re : triangles). The los inclination increases from \u03b8 = 0 (face-on) to \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 (edge-on) along the arrows, and\nthe cases \u03b8 = 0, Ra = Re are arbitrarily placed on the FP best-fit line.

In particular, we consider the cases v = vp,max (the maximum\nprojected velocity) and v = vp (Re /8), as representative\nof the measured rotation. The resulting trends are shown\nin Fig. 4, and it is clear how all the resulting curves lie\nbelow the (uncorrected) locus of isotropic, classical ellipsoids obtained from the tensor virial theorem (solid line I).\nDeviations with respect to the \"classical\" expectation are\nlarger when v = vp (Re /8), a case analogous to those considered by CB. Remarkably, our analysis shows that curve\nII (derived from the sky-averaged virial theorem) provides\na much better estimate of v/\u03c3 (and so, of anisotropy) than\nthe original one based on the (unprojected) tensor virial\ntheorem, when \u03c3 = \u03c3a (Re /8) and v = vp,max . Note also\nhow the central cusp slope can be important, especially\nwhen using small aperture to determine v.\nThus we conclude that particular care should be placed\non the choice of the theoretical v/\u03c3 locus to be used for\ncomparison with the data, as a function of the quality and\nextension of the data themselves (see also DG).\n\n6. Discussion and conclusions\nIn this paper we have quantified the contribution of ordered rotation to the FP tilt and thickness. We adopted\na class of oblate galaxy models with central cusp and ad-\n\njustable flattening and amount of rotational support. We\nalso considered models with a dark matter halo and with\na central super-massive black hole. The associated Jeans\nequations have been (numerically) solved under the assumption of an underlying two-integrals distribution function. The main results can be summarized as follow:\n1. For the adopted family of models the effect of a central\nSMBH is stronger on streaming velocities than on velocity dispersions. However, for mass ratios of the order\nof those predicted by the Magorrian relation, the effect\nis in general negligible, and the presence of a central\nSMBH can be neglected when studying relations such\nas the FP.\n2. In agreement with previous results of LC and CB, also\nfor the adopted class of cuspy models the contribution\nof streaming motions to the observed velocity dispersion is negligible when small/medium apertures (<\n\u223c Re )\nare used for the spectroscopic observations. This implies that a systematic decrease of rotational support\nwith increasing luminosity is not at the origin of the\ntilt of the FP of elliptical galaxies at low-redshift.\n3. In general, the aperture velocity dispersion measured\nat Ra >\n\u223cRe is larger for not rotating models than\nfor rotationally supported models (and the difference\nincreases significantly when a dark matter halo is\npresent). This must be taken properly into account\nwhen studying the FP, or estimating the mass-to-light\nratios at high redshift.\n\n\fRiciputi et al.: Rotational effects on the FP thickness\n\n1.6\n\u03b3 = 0.0\n\u03b3 = 1.0\n\u03b3 = 1.5\n\n1.4\n\nI\n\nII\n\nv/\u03c3\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0.2\n\nand L.C. by the Italian Cofin \"Collective phenomena in the\ndynamics of galaxies\".\n\nAppendix A: A simple, analytical, cuspy and\naxisymmetric galaxy model with dark matter\nhalo and central SMBH\n\n1.2\n\n0\n\n9\n\n0.4\n\u01eb\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nFig. 4. Rotational parameter for isotropic, edge-on models\nas a function of their ellipticity. The solid thick curve I is\nthe locus of isotropic, classical ellipsoids as obtained from\nthe tensor virial theorem (Binney 1978; see also Eq.[4.95]\nin BT), while solid line II is derived from the sky-averaged\ntensor virial theorem (Eq. [26] of Binney 2005, with \u03b4 = 0\nand \u03b1 = 0) . The upper set of curves represents our models\nwhen vp = vp,max , while the lower set of curves represents\nour models when v = vp (Re /8). In all cases we adopt\n\u03c3 = \u03c3a (Re /8).\n4. When observed from different los inclinations, models move in the (log Re , log Ie , log \u03c30 ) space along directions that are not parallel to the edge-on view of\nthe FP, thus confirming that projection effects do\ncontribute to the observed FP scatter. The models\ndisplacement depends mainly on their intrinsic flattening (being larger for more flattened systems), on\nthe amount of rotational support, and on the aperture used to measure \u03c30 . These effects however, when\nweighted over the distribution of ellipticities and los\ninclinations, would produce statistical displacements\nwell within the FP thickness, in agreement with the\nconclusions of LC.\n5. Finally, as a by-product of the present investigation\nwe studied the position of the models in the v/\u03c3ellipticity plane, a tool used to discriminate between\nrotationally and velocity dispersion supported galaxies. We found that, while our models remain well below\nthe (uncorrected) locus of classical ellipsoids as determined from the tensor virial theorem, their position\nis well predicted by sky-averaged projected virial theorem (Binney 2005) if the peak rotational velocity is\nused.\nAcknowledgements.
