In other words,\nthe QDA functions as a spin filter, which may be\nused to detect and manipulate spin states.

The third and fourth\nterms describe the coupling between the quantum\ndot (QD) and the two leads. The fifth and sixth\nterms describe the energy level of the quantum dot\nand interdot coupling. The last term describes the\nintradot Coulomb interaction. We take into account\nonly one energy level for each dot and the nearestneighbor coupling between dots (ti,j = \u2212t for nearest -neightbor i, j). For small size QDs, the energy\ndifference between the ground state and the first excited state is much larger than t and the Coulomb\ninteraction U . Therefore, it is a good approximation\nto consider just one energy level in each dot.\nUsing Keldysh's Green function method[12] , we\nobtain the spin-dependent tunneling current\neX\nJ\u03c3 = \u2212\n[fL \u2212 fR ]|Vk |2 ImGk|| ,\u03c3 (\u03c9k ),\n(1)\nh\u0304\n\nWe show theoretically that a strongly spin-polarized\ncurrent can be generated in semiconductors by taking\nadvantage of the ferromagnetic phase of a quantum dot\narray (QDA). A Hubbard model with coupling to leads is\nused to study the tunneling current of the QDA system\nas a function of gate voltage. Due to the weak interdot\ncoupling and strong Coulomb repulsion, it is found that\na ferromagnetic phase exists in QDA within a window of\ngate voltage. Therefore QDA can be used as a spin filter\nto detect and control spin states in quantum information\ndevices.\n\nRecently, spintronics and quantum information\n(QI) processing have attracted a great deal of\nattention.[1] A good QI system should provide\nwell defined quantum computational space, precise quantum-state preparation, coherent quantum\nmanipulation, and state detection[2]. Solid state\ndevices based on modern advanced semiconductor\ntechniques opened up the possibility of fabricating\nlarge integrated networks which would be required\nfor the realization of quantum computation[3,4].\nBoth charged states[5] and spin states[6] of electrons have been proposed to carry the quantum information. Because the decoherence time of spin is\nmuch longer than that of charge[6], using the spin\nis more promising for quantum information processing. Kane has proposed to use the nuclear spin as\nthe quantum bit, since its decoherence time is much\nlonger than that of the electron spin[7]. Nevertheless, its manipulation is difficult due to the weak\ncoupling between nuclear spin and electron spin (hyperfine interaction). Thus, the use of spin states of\nelectrons in semiconductors remains a viable option.\nOne of the challenging problems is the preparation\nof electrons in semiconductors with well defined spin\nstate.\nControlling electron spin states, such as coherent\nmanipulation and filtering, becomes crucial in the\nimplementation of quantum computer. DiVincenzo\n[8] has suggested to use the spin filter effect to manipulate spin states. Semiconductor quantum dots\nwith local magnetic field can be used as spin filter\nand momory (read out) device [9]. Ferromagnetic\nsemiconductor materials can also be used as spin filters[10,11]. EuO and EuS have been suggested as\nspin filters by DiVincenzo[8], but the compatibitity\nof these magnetic materials with conventional semiconductors like GaAs or Si or Ge is unclear. The\nspin polarization in tunneling current has exceeded\n\nk\n\nwhere \u03c9k denotes the energy of the electron in the\nleads with wave vector k. fL = f (\u03c9k \u2212 \u03bcL ) and\nfR = f (\u03c9k \u2212 \u03bcR ) are the Fermi distribution function of the left lead and right lead, respectively. \u03bcL\nand \u03bcR are the chemical potentials in the left and\nright leads, respectively. They are related to the applied bias, Va by \u03bcL \u2212 \u03bcR = eVa . For simplicity,\nwe assume that the QD couples with the left and\nright leads symmetrically, although it is straightforward to extend\nP to the case with asymmetric coupling. Vk = j Vj,k e\u2212ik|| *Rj where k|| is the projection of electron wave vector k in the QDA plane\nand Rj is the position of the j-th QD. We propose\n1\n\n\fa setup in which a small bias Va (eVa is comparable\nto t) is applied, and scan the gate voltage Vg (which\nserves the purpose of tuning the QD energy level E0\nrelative to the Fermi level in the leads) in order to\nobserve the spin-dependent current.\nThe calculation of tunneling current is entirely\ndetermined by the retarded Green function for the\nQDA. Finding the spin-polarized Green function for\nthe Hubbard model was considered a challenging\nproblem [13]. It is well known that the retarded\nGreen function obtained within the Hubbard approximation does not support any magnetic ordering[14]. However, Harris and Lange[15] showed that\nferromagnetic ordering can be a stable state in the\n3D Hubbard model by introducing the spin dependent band shift. This mechanism plays the crucial\nrole for determining the ferromagnetic state[15-18].\nBeenen and Edwards[13] used the approach developed by Roth[16] to study the 2D Hubbard model for\nthe normal and superconducting state of CuO2 . The\nquasi-particle excitation energy they obtained is in\nvery good agreement with quantum Monte Carlo calculations[19]. Therefore we adopt Roth's procedure\nto calculate the retarded Green function Gk|| ,\u03c3 (\u03c9),\nwhile taking into account the coupling between QDA\nand leads. In the weak-coupling limit (t \u226a U ), we\nobtain\n\nstate in 3D. Nevertheless, w1,\u03c3 is kept in the present\ncalculation in order to obtain more accurate result.\nWhen the chemical potential in the left lead is\nlower than E0 + U and U \u226b t, the effect due to\nthe high energy pole of the Green function can be\nignored. Consequently, the infinite U limit can be\nused in the calculation of Wk|| ,\u2212\u03c3 [16] which yields\nn\u03c3 Wk|| ,\u03c3 =\nwith\nn1,\u03c3 =\n\nn21,\u03c3 (1 \u2212 n\u03c3 ) + n1,\u03c3 n1,\u2212\u03c3\n\u22124tn1,\u03c3\n\u2212 \u01eb(k|| )\n1 \u2212 n\u03c3\n(1 \u2212 n\u03c3 )(1 \u2212 n\u03c3 \u2212 n\u2212\u03c3 )\n\nZ\n\u22121 X \u01eb(k)\nd\u03c9[fL (\u03c9) + fR (\u03c9)]ImGk|| ,\u03c3 (\u03c9).\n2\u03c0\n4t\nk||\n\nThe number of electron per dot is calculated by\nXZ\nn\u03c3 =\n\n\u22121\n2\u03c0\n\nd\u03c9[fL (\u03c9) + fR (\u03c9)]ImGk|| ,\u03c3 (\u03c9).\n\n(2)\n\nk||\n\nAt zero temperature, the integral over \u03c9 can be\ncarried out analytically.

We treat \u0393 as a constant\n0.5t, and t, respectively, where the system becomes\nparameter, even though it can be determined via\nspin polarized. The system remains ferromagnetic\na numerical method [20]. This approximation is\nfor n within a small window and reverts to the paravalid for the small range of applied bais, because\nmagnetic state at n \u2248 0.4, beyond which the pseudothe potential barrier between leads and QDA is\nequilibrium condition[16] can no longer be satisfied\nhigh.

As the applied bias is increased, the\nquate to consider the coupling between the QDA\nspin polarization and the domain that maintains the\nand the leads within the Hatree-Fock approximaspin polarization are reduced. Eventually, the aption[21](leading order). Here we consider a square\nplied bias will totally destroy the spin polarization\nlattice with lattice constant a.

The\nspin dependent tunneling current shown in Fig. 2\nimplies that we can readily manipulate the spin polarization of the tunneling current by the gate voltage without introducing magnetic field or magnetic\ndopants. Although the value of the spin polarization (Ps ) obtained here is not very high, we believe\nthat Ps can be enhanced by using coupled multiple\nlayers of QDAs, since in the 3D Hubbard model the\nferromagnetic phase is stable over a wider range of\nn and n\u2191 (for majority carrier) can approach 1.[16]\nAccording to Eq. (1), the tunneling current J\u2193 (for\nminority carrier) can be reduced to zero as a result\nof the factor (1 \u2212 n\u2191 ), and Ps can approach 1.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by DARPA DAAD1901-1-0324.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n8\n9\n\n10\n11\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\nC.
