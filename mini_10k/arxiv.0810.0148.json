In contrast to the standard\nparadigm of quantum computation [3], which is implemented through gates embedded in a quantum circuit,\ncontinuous-time algorithms [4], and in particular adiabatic ones [1, 2, 5] proceed through the controlled evolution of some Hamiltonians designed to solve the specified\nproblem. The adiabatic Grover algorithm, for instance,\ninvolves a time-dependent Hamiltonian which smoothly\ndrives the system, in a time exhibiting a quadratic\nspeedup, from one of its eigenstates |wi that is easily prepared to a connected eigenstate that coincides with the\nmarked entry |mi of the database. This can be achieved\nwith the two-parameter Hamiltonian\nH = a(t)Hi + b(t)Hf ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Hi = |wihw| and Hf = |mihm| are simply projectors on the appropriate states while a and b are timedependent parameters which vanish at the final and initial times, respectively, to ensure that the prepared and\ntarget states are eigenstates.\nThe eigenstates of H form in general an avoided crossing as a function of time. The search is achieved when the\ndynamics follows adiabatically the instantaneous eigenstate connected initially to the prepared state |wi and\nfinally to the marked state |mi. The way the parameters\na and b vary around the avoided crossing is key to making the search exhibit or not a quadratic speedup. It has\nbeen shown that achieving a quadratic speedup requires\na non-linear dynamics of the parameters: The dynamics\nhas to slow down when approaching the smallest gap of\nthe avoided crossing and has to accelerate afterwards [5].\nThis strategy will be referred to as local strategy.\nIn this paper we apply the strategy of optimal adiabatic passage developed in Refs. [6, 7] for two-level\n\nmodels of the form (with real couplings)\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u2206(t) \u03a9(t)\n.\nH=\n\u03a9(t) \u2212\u2206(t)\n\nIt has been shown that, for a given smooth pulsed-shape\ncoupling of the form \u03a9(t) = \u03a90 \u039b(t) (with \u039b(\u00b1\u221e) = 0)\nand for the parametrization \u2206(t)/\u22060 + \u03a9(t)/\u03a90 = 1, the\npopulation transfer is the most efficient, in the adiabatic\nregime, when the instantaneous eigenvalues are parallel.\nThis corresponds to \u22060 = \u03a90 , i.e. to level lines (corresponding to circles of equation \u03a9(t)2 + \u2206(t)2 = \u220620 ) in\nthe diagram of the difference of the eigenvalue surfaces\nas a function of the two parameters \u03a9(t) and \u2206(t).\nWe show that this strategy, referred to as parallel strategy, applied to the problem of quantum search using the\ntwo-parameter Hamiltonian (1) leads\n\u221a to a Grover type\nsearch, i.e. scaling with time as N . It is moreover\nmore efficient than the local strategy proposed in Ref.\n[5] since it allows one to increase the success rate to hit\nthe searched state.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we describe the model and the strategies to achieve the quantum search. In particular, the local and parallel strategies\nare presented. Section III is devoted to the definition of a\ncost and the calculation of the non-adiabatic losses which\nare used to define the optimality and to compare the local and parallel strategies.

For the\nsearch problem, the initial state is the uniform superpoPN\nsition |wi = \u221a1N i=1 |ii which gives no particular role\nto any state of the computational basis. Since |wi is the\neigenvector of unit eigenvalue of Hi , taking b(ti ) = 0 implies that the instantaneous eigenvector |+i is connected\nto |wi at the initial time ti :\nb(ti ) = 0 \u2192 |+i(ti ) = |wi.\n\n(8)\n\nAt the final time tf , we require this eigenvector of higher\neigenvalue to coincide with the marked target state,\nwhich is satisfied for a(tf ) = 0,\na(tf ) = 0 \u2192 |+i(tf ) = |mi.\n\n\u03bb+ \u2212 \u03bb\u2212\n.\n2\n\n(10)\n\n(12)\n\nB.\n\nLocal strategy\n\nThe strategy proposed by Roland and Cerf [5] consists in applying the adiabaticity condition locally in time\nrather than on the whole interval as in (10) and correspondingly adapting the rate \u03b8\u0307 at which the gap \u03bb+ \u2212 \u03bb\u2212\nis crossed,\n\u03b8\u0307 = \u03b5\n\n\u03bb+ \u2212 \u03bb\u2212\n.\n2\n\n(13)\n\nThis is equivalent to fixing instantaneously the nonadiabatic losses to \u03b52 at any time applying timedependent perturbation theory on the Hamiltonian (6).\nWith the parametrization a + b = \u03b1, (4) becomes\nr\n\u03b1 \u03b1\nN \u22121\n\u03bb\u00b1 = \u00b1\n1\u22124\na(1 \u2212 a).\n(14)\n2\n2\nN\nHence, (13) yields a differential equation for a,\n\nLinear strategy\n\n\u0227 = \u2212\n\nA naive algorithm would interpolate linearly between\nthe values of a and b at the initial and final times,\ntf \u2212 t\nTlinear\nt \u2212 ti\nb(t) = \u03b1\n,\nTlinear\n\nN\n.\n\u03b5\n\nA quantum algorithm with such a linear dynamics therefore does not perform better than a classical search. As\nnoted in Ref. [5], this stems from the fact that by applying (10) globally, i. e., to the entire time interval, one imposes a constraint on the evolution rate during the whole\ncomputation while the constraint is only severe where\nthe gap is close to the minimum. In the next section,\nwe recall the strategy proposed by Roland and Cerf [5]\nwhich amounts to applying locally the adiabatic theorem\nfor infinitesimal time intervals and adapting the rate at\nwhich the gap in eigenvalues is crossed. Our approach,\nwhich is presented afterwards in Sec. II C, consists in\nfollowing level lines on the surface of eigenvalues difference corresponding to parallel eigenvalues, i. e., instead\nof following a given path at a varying speed, we follow\na different path at a constant speed. This approach has\nbeen shown [6, 7], in a different context, to both be robust and strongly reduce the nonadiabatic losses.\n\n(9)\n\nThe adiabatic theorem [1] can be recovered from (6):\nstarting from an instantaneous eigenvector, its population remains larger than 1 \u2212 \u03b52 provided the ratio of the\noff-diagonal coupling and the gap between the eigenvalues is at least \u03b5,\n\nA.\n\n\u03b1Tlinear > 2\n\n\u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2[\n\nIn the adiabatic representation, the Hamiltonian becomes\n\nmaxt\u2208[ti ,tf ] \u03b8\u0307 < \u03b5 mint\u2208[ti ,tf ]\n\nwith \u03b1 some multiplicative constant which fixes the energy levels and Tlinear \u2261 tf \u2212 ti the total duration of the\nprocess.\nFrom (4) one deduces that\n\u221a the smallest gap is\n\u221a\n\u03b1/ N while (7) yields maxt \u03b8\u0307 = N /Tlinear.

In\nthe numerics, we have truncated the time interval from\nt = \u22124Tk to t = 4Tk . We have checked that taking a\nlarger interval does not change significantly the result.\nWe have chosen a situation leading to the same efficiency\nas the local strategy example shown in Fig. 1.\nComparing Figs. 1 and 2, one also notices that the\nsearch is achieved in an oscillatory manner for the local\nstrategy whereas it is achieved in a monotonic manner\nfor the parallel strategy. This feature, as well as the enhancement of the success rate for the parallel strategy,\ncan be interpreted using superadiabatic basis that are\nbetter adapted to describe the dynamics [8, 9]. In general, for a strategy using analytic coupling parameters (as\nconsidered in the parallel strategy), in the adiabatic limit,\nthe non-adiabatic losses are exponentially small, i.e. of\nthe form \u223c e\u2212|const.|Tk and thus beyond any power of\n1/Tk while the corresponding history of the dynamics is\nsmooth and monotonic. For the local strategy, the condition (13) prevents the analyticity of the parameters. The\ndiscontinuity of the coupling gives rise to losses which\nare of order 2 in the off-diagonal elements of (6). More\ngenerally, a discontinuity of the nth derivative of the couplings corresponds to polynomial non-adiabatic losses of\nthe order of (1/T n+1 )2 , and the corresponding dynamics\nexhibits oscillations. Indeed, the transformation leading\nto (6) can be iterated, that is one may further diagonalize\n(6), which yields higher order derivatives [9, 10].\nAs we show more precisely in the next section, for an\nidentical search cost, the parallel strategy generally enhances the success rate, i. e. reduces the non-adiabatic\nlosses, with respect to the local strategy, or equivalently\nreduces the cost for an identical success rate.\nIII.\n\nCOMPARISON: COST AND LOSSES\n\nIn order to compare the local and parallel strategies,\nwe shall take into account both the computational cost\nand the success rate of the search.\n\nSearch cost\n\nIn actual implementations, the time-dependent coupling parameters a(t) and b(t) can be achieved, for instance, by laser fields [11]. As a measure of the cost\nneeded to achieve the Grover search we can consider a\nquantity which is the equivalent of the total laser power.\nNote that the coupling parameters can either vary significantly during the whole duration of the process (e.\ng. in the local strategy) or during a small fraction only\n(e. g. in the parallel strategy). In order to account for\nboth situations, we define the cost C as the product of\nthe peak value apeak of the coupling parameter a(t) and\nthe effective duration of the search Teff\nC = apeak Teff ,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere Teff is directly related to the characteristic time T\nof variation of a(t) and is typically a few repetitions of\nit, Teff = rT . Indeed, considering a(t) as a pulse, T is its\ncharacteristic width whereas Teff is the full duration for\nwhich a(t) is significantly different from its asymptotic\nt \u2192 \u00b1\u221e values (hence it can be defined rigorously given\nsome tolerance level). Note that one could define the cost\nas the area under a(t) for this effective duration. The\nresult would generally differ only by a numerical factor\nclose to one whereas (24) is usually more convenient to\ncompute.\nFor the local strategy, one deduces from (18) that the\neffective duration Teff corresponds to the whole duration\nTlocal = tf \u2212 ti given in (17). The cost reads thus\n\u221a\n2 N \u22121\nClocal = \u03b1Tlocal =\n.\n(25)\n\u03b5\nFor the parallel strategy, we consider analytical functions such as F (t) = tanh(t/Tk ), which approach their\nasymptotic values for times t with |t| >\n\u223c rTk /2. From\n(22), one obtains the peak value apeak = \u221a\u03b2(N \u22122) .\nHence, we have\n\u03b2(N \u2212 2)\nCk = p\nrTk \u223c \u03b2rTk .\nN (N \u2212 1)\n\nN (N \u22121)\n\n(26)\n\nNote that this relation seems to imply that Tk can be\nchoosen arbitrarily (for instance of order N 0 ); However,\nthe non-adiabatic losses, studied below, would then increase dramatically.\nWe shall compare the two strategies at identical costs\nand then focus our attention below on the success rate of\nthe search. Requiring an identical cost for both strategies\nyields\n\u221a\n2(N \u2212 1) N\n\u03b2rTk =\n\u223c \u03b1Tlocal .\n(27)\n(N \u2212 2)\u03b5\nFor large N , the characteristic time of the squared hyperbolic secant, associated with the same cost for both\n\n\f5\nstrategies, is thus just (\u03b1/\u03b2r) \u00d7 Tlocal . Moreover, we can\nrequire the effective duration of the search to be equal for\nboth strategies which simply amounts to having \u03b1 = \u03b2.\nNote that if one chooses \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 1, then the search cost\nis directly equal to the effective search duration. Since\nthere is no loss of generality, we shall assume \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 1\nthroughout.\nB.\n\nthe final time. This is given by 1 \u2212 Ploss where Ploss\ncorresponds to the probability of the non-adiabatic losses\nfrom the instantaneous eigenstate initially populated to\nthe other states. These losses arise because the adiabatic\nstate connected to the initial state is not strictly followed\nas \u03b8\u0307 is not strictly zero. For the local strategy, the loss\nat the final time can be calculated exactly for any N .\nIndeed, the Hamiltonian (6) can be rewritten as\n\nNon-adiabatic losses\n\nThe success rate of the search is determined by the\nprobability to find the system in the marked state at\n\nHad = |+ih+| + |\u2212ih\u2212| +\n\n\u03bb+ \u2212 \u03bb\u2212\n{|+ih+| \u2212 |\u2212ih\u2212| + i\u03b5 (|\u2212ih+| \u2212 |+ih\u2212|)} ,\n2\n\n(28)\n\nwhere \u03bb+ \u2212 \u03bb\u2212 depends on time according to (19), and use was made of (14) to get \u03bb+ + \u03bb\u2212 = \u03b1 = 1. Upon\nR t \u03bb+ \u2212\u03bb\u2212\nextracting the first term which gives rise to a phase and defining a new time \u03c4 (t) =\ndt one obtains a\n2\nstationary Hamiltonian.

However these choices of specific and thus non-robust values\nwill not be considered here since they are outside the adiabatic scope. A good measure of the losses is the upper\nboundary \u03b52 . The adiabatic regime for the local strategy\nis thus reached when \u03b5 \u226a 1, i.e., using (17), when\nTlocal\n2\n\u221a\n= \u226b1\n\u03b5\nN\n\nN \u226b 1.\n\n(32)\n\nFor the level line optimization, it has been shown in\nRef.

In Fig.\n3 we plot the non-adiabatic losses obtained\nnumerically\n\u221a\nas a function of 1/\u03b3 defined as Tk / N . The case N =\n20 (oscillating full line) is close to the asymptotic result\n(non-oscillating one) which, as expected from (33), shows\na strong exponential decay. The search is efficient for\n1/\u03b3 \u2265 1, with for instance Ploss, k \u223c 10\u22122 for \u03b3 = 1.\nSimilar results hold for other values of N .\n\nIn contrast to the local strategy, the parallel strategy uses analytical couplings on an unbounded domain.\nHence, in practice one has to truncate this domain to\nlimit the time of search. This truncation of the couplings,\nbreaking the continuity, leads in general to additional\nnon-adiabatic losses. In Sec. III A we defined the finite\ndomain through the quantity r as Teff = rTk . Figure 3\nshows the losses for r = 8 and r = 12. As expected, the\nloss becomes larger for smaller r when decreasing \u03b3. For\nr = 12, the range of validity of the asymptotic formula\n(35) is approximately 1/\u03b3 <\n\u223c 3. This means that up to\n1/\u03b3 \u223c 3 the additional losses due to the truncation can\nbe neglected (otherwise, one could take a larger value for\nr).\n\nFigure 4 depicts the losses as a function of N for a\ngiven value of \u03b5 and the corresponding value of \u03b3 given\nby (36) with two truncations r = 8 and r = 12.

(36) to have the same cost.\n\n(36), despite the truncation of the time interval which\nbreaks the analyticity of the coupling. Note, however,\nthat a truncation with too small a value for r can lead\nto a significant dependance of the losses with N .\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have proposed a strategy to achieve the Grover\nsearch by adiabatic passage using parallel eigenvalues.\nWe have compared this parallel strategy with the known\nlocal strategy which requires an adaptation of the speed\nof the dynamics with respect to the given dynamical gap\nbetween the eigenvalues. We have shown the superiority\nof the parallel strategy: for an identical search cost, the\nparallel strategy enhances the success rate with respect\nto the local strategy, i. e. reduces the non-adiabatic\nlosses, or equivalently reduces the cost for an identical\nsuccess rate.\nSmooth analytic coupling parameters are in principle required for the parallel strategy. We have however\nshown numerically that a truncation of the time domain,\nwhich is necessary in practice, preserves the higher efficiency of the success rate of the search at identical cost.\nWe have here used an hyperbolic tangent for F (t) since\nit allows one to determine analytically the population\ndynamics for large N . We have checked that other similar shapes for F (t), for instance associated to Gaussians\nwhich are easily performed in the laboratory, preserves\nthe advantage of the parallel strategy over the local one.\n\n\f7\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors are grateful to H.-R.
