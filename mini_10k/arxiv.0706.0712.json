For static, spherically symmetric black holes, the\nfixed values of the scalars at the horizon are determined in terms of the quantized electric and magnetic charges characterizing the solution, as extrema of\nan effective potential VBH [5]. This induces to expect the radial dependence\nof the scalar fields in each extremal solution to admit a description in terms\nof a system of first order equations:\n\u03a6\u0307r \u221d \u2202 r W (\u03a6) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhich implies the second order field equations, provided VBH has a definite\nexpression in terms of W and its derivatives. In this description, the attractor point \u03a6\u0307 = 0 is given by the singular point \u2202r W (\u03a60 ) = 0 which is also an\nextremum of VBH . We will call W the prepotential of the extremal solution.\nThis is indeed the case for BPS black holes, whose associated first-order differential equations are implied by the Killing-spinor equations. For the N = 2\ncase one finds W = |Z| where Z is the central charge of the supersymmetry algebra. Therefore, the problem has raised of finding the analogous first\norder differential equations, with the associated prepotential, describing the\nnon-BPS extremal solutions. Another motivation for developing a first order\nformulation is that it provides a natural framework for defining a c-function\nassociated with the radial flow of the fields in these solutions [19]. In fact,\nas we will show, the squared prepotential is a viable candidate for such a\nfunction, sharing with it the monotonicity properties along a solution and\nthe value taken at the horizon 2 .\nThis problem was first addressed in [14] where, by exploiting the formal\nanalogy between extremal black holes and domain wall solutions, explicit\nexamples of W corresponding to certain N = 2 non-BPS extremal solutions\nwere found.\n2\n\nWe thank Sandip Trivedi for drawing this to our attention.\n\n2\n\n\fIt is the aim of the present paper to give a general form of the prepotential\nin extended supergravity which will allow to reproduce the attractor behavior\nof all the known extremal black-hole solutions for N \u2265 3. W will be given\nas a function of the U-duality invariants of the theory built in terms of the\ndressed charges. Different attractors will correspond to different choices of\nthe coefficients in W . Let us notice, however, that the general ansatz we\ngive for W can be considered as a minimal one reproducing correctly all\nthe attractor points of static extremal black-hole solutions in extended four\ndimensional supergravity. However, if we consider the full black-hole solution\noutside the horizon, it turns out that our ansatz requires a restriction, in the\nN-even cases, on the duality invariants characterizing the non-BPS Z 6= 0\nattractors. More precisely, for these solutions the above restriction amounts\nto fixing an invariant overall phase of the complex dressed charges at radial\ninfinity to the value it takes on the horizon. We argue that a refined ansatz\ncould relax this restriction.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section two we recall the main facts\nabout static, spherically symmetric black holes and introduce the prepotential W , proving, in the extremal case, that it is monotonic. In section 3,\nwhich contains the main results of the paper, the general expression for W in\nthe extremal case is given for N \u2265 3 extended supergravity, and also some examples of N = 2 solutions. Section 4, which includes the concluding remarks,\ncontains a speculative discussion where the issue of a possible extension of\nthe definition of the prepotential to the non extremal case is addressed. For\na class of non extremal black holes we show that a first order formulation in\nterms of a prepotential W may exist and we find the corresponding description in terms of first order differential equations. This generalizes the results\nin [18] to the case of scalar-matter coupled gravity.\n\n2\n\nBlack holes as solutions to first order differential equations\n\nWe will consider the class of theories described by the bosonic action [3]:\n\u0012\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n1\n4\n\u039b\n\u039b\n\u0393\nS =\n\u2212g d x \u2212 R + ImN\u039b\u0393 F\u03bc\u03bd\nF \u0393|\u03bc\u03bd + \u221a\nReN\u039b\u0393 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 F\u03bc\u03bd\nF\u03c1\u03c3\n+\n2\n2 \u2212g\n\u0013\n1\nr \u03bc s\n(2)\ngrs (\u03a6)\u2202\u03bc \u03a6 \u2202 \u03a6 ,\n+\n2\n3\n\n\fwhere R is the scalar curvature, \u03a6r are a set of scalar fields and F \u039b gauge\nfield strengths. grs (\u03a6), N\u039b\u03a3 (\u03a6) (r, s, * * * = 1, * * * , m) are matrices depending\non the scalar fields.\nThe most general Ansatz for a spherically symmetric and stationary metric is\n\u0012\n\u0013\nc4\nc2\n2\n2U\n2\n\u22122U\n2\n2\nds = e dt \u2212 e\n(3)\nd\u03c4 +\nd\u03a9 .\nsinh4 (c\u03c4 )\nsinh2 (c\u03c4 )\nThe evolution coordinate \u03c4 is related to the radial coordinate r by the following relation:\n\u0012 \u00132\ndr\nc2\n= (r \u2212 r0 )2 \u2212 c2 = (r \u2212 r \u2212 ) (r \u2212 r + ) .\n(4)\n=\n2\nd\u03c4\nsinh (c\u03c4 )\nr\u00b1 being the radii of the two event horizons, with r+ > r\u2212 .

(4) reduces\nto \u03c4 = \u2212 r\u2212r1 H , where rH denotes the radius of the horizon.\nIt is known [5] that by eliminating the vector fields via their equations of\nmotion this system may be reduced to the following set of field equations for\nthe metric function U(\u03c4 ) and the scalar fields \u03a6r (\u03c4 ) in terms of the evolution\nparameter \u03c4 :\nd2 U\n\u2261 \u00dc = VBH (\u03a6, p, q)e2U ,\nd\u03c4 2\nD 2 \u03a6r\n\u2202V (\u03a6, p, q) 2U\n\u2261 \u03a6\u0308r + \u0393r st \u03a6\u0307s \u03a6\u0307t = g rs (\u03a6) BH s\ne ,\n2\nD\u03c4\n\u2202\u03a6\ntogether with the constraint\n\u0012 \u00132\nd\u03a6r d\u03a6s\ndU\n1\n\u2212 VBH (\u03a6, p, q)e2U = c2 ,\n+ grs (\u03a6)\nd\u03c4\n2\nd\u03c4 d\u03c4\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere VBH (\u03a6, p, q) is a function of the scalars and of the electric and magnetic\ncharges of the theory defined by:\n1\nVBH = \u2212 Qt M(N )Q ,\n2\n\n4\n\n(8)\n\n\fand Q is the symplectic vector of quantized magnetic and electric charges\nQt = (p\u039b , q\u039b ).

We argue that the extremal case corresponds to\n\u2202\u03c4 W = 0\n\n\u21d2\n\nW = W (\u03a6) ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhile for non extremal black holes, in those cases which admit a first order\ndescription, an explicit dependence of W on \u03c4 should be included.\n\n2.1\n\nExtremal case\n\nLet us consider in detail the extremal case c = 0. In this case eq. (11)\nbecomes\nU\u0307 = W (\u03a6) eU .\n\n(13)\n\nDifferentiating (13) with respect to \u03c4 gives\n\u00dc = (U\u0307)2 + \u1e86 eU \u2261 W 2 e2U + \u1e86 eU ,\n5\n\n(14)\n\n\fwhere\n\u1e86 = \u03a6\u0307r \u2202r W .\n\n(15)\n\nComparing eq. (14) with (5) we find the following expression for VBH :\nVBH = W 2 + e\u2212U \u1e86 .\n\n(16)\n\nMoreover from eqs. (5) and (7) one finds:\n1\n\u00dc \u2212 (U\u0307)2 = grs \u03a6\u0307r \u03a6\u0307s = \u03a6\u0307r \u2202r W eU ,\n2\n\n(17)\n\nwhile eq. (14) can be recast in the form:\n\u00dc \u2212 (U\u0307)2 = \u1e86 eU = \u03a6\u0307r \u2202r W eU .\n\n(18)\n\nIt follows that, for \u03a6\u0307r 6= 0, is solved for 3 :\n\u03a6\u0307r = 2 eU g rs \u2202s W .\n\n(22)\n\nEq. (22) is reminiscent of the BPS condition; for a given W it relates the\nevolution of the scalar fields on the corresponding configuration to the partial\nderivative of the prepotential W with respect to the scalar fields. Note in\nparticular that the fixed points for \u03a6r are in direct relation with the extrema\n3\n\nTo be precise, the most general solution to the constraint (17) would be:\n\u03a6\u0307r\n\n2 eU g rs \u2202s W + \u03b1r (\u03a6, \u03c4 ) ,\n(19)\n\u0010\n\u0011\nr\n\u03a6\u0307s\nwhere \u03b1r = P rs hs and P r s \u2261 \u03b4sr \u2212 \u03a6\u0307\nis a projector orthogonal to \u03a6\u0307r . In this more\n\u03a6\u0307l \u03a6\u0307l\ngeneral case the effective potential would include one additional term:\nVBH\n\n=\n\n1\n= W 2 + 2\u2202r W \u2202 r W \u2212 e\u22122U \u03b1r \u03b1r .\n2\n\n(20)\n\nFor \u03b1r 6= 0, however, the attractor condition at the horizon becomes\n1\nlim \u2202r W = \u2212 e\u2212U \u03b1r (\u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e) 6= 0 .\n2\n\n\u03c4 \u2192\u2212\u221e\n\n(21)\n\nAs we will see in the following (see eq. (25)), such deformation is immaterial since it gives\nfor the entropy the same value V |extr = W 2 |extr as for the case with \u03b1r = 0. It could\ninstead play a role in more general situations, for example when considering black-holes\nout of extremality, where the effect of \u03b1r would be to effectively deform the constant\nnon-extremality parameter c2 into a function C 2 (\u03a6, \u03c4 ) = c2 + 21 \u03b1r \u03b1r .\n\n6\n\n\fof W . Together with (11) and (15), (22) allows to express the field-equations\nin terms of a first order system. Indeed, using (22) the effective potential\nreads [14]\nVBH = W 2 + 2 g rs \u2202r W \u2202s W .\n\n(23)\n\nBy inserting eq.s (22) and (23) in the second order evolution equation for\nthe scalars, eq. (6), we find that it is identically satisfied. This shows that, as\nfar as the scalar sector is concerned, the system of second order differential\nequations (6) is in fact a first order system once expressed in terms of the\nprepotential W . Moreover, given any explicit expression for W , also the\nspace-time metric may be found as solution of a first-order equation (13).\nFurthermore, the effective potential (23) is extremized for\n\u0001\n\u2202VBH\ns\nsl\n\u2261\n\u2202\nV\n=\n2\n\u2202\nW\nW\n\u03b4\n+\n2g\n\u2207\n\u2202\nW\n= 0,\nr\nBH\ns\nr\nl\nr\n\u2202\u03a6r\n\n(24)\n\nthat is the fixed points for the scalars (corresponding to extrema of W ) are\nalso extrema of the potential VBH . Since the black-hole horizon is identified\nas the fixed point of the scalars, in this formulation it is directly related to\nthe extrema of W (that are in particular also extrema for VBH . The BH\nentropy then reads, in terms of W , as\nSBH = VBH |extr = W 2 |extr\n\n(25)\n\nFurthermore, let us observe that from the evolution equations above, together\nwith the boundary condition on U at spatial infinity (U(\u03c4 = 0) = 0), it is\neasy to deduce that W and W 2 are monotonic functions, both decreasing\nalong the evolution from spatial infinity towards the horizon. Indeed, if we\ndefine the function b(\u03c4 ) = \u2212 \u03c41 e\u2212U , as in [7], the conditions of regularity of\nthe solution at the horizon and of flatness of space-time at radial infinity,\nimply the following limiting behaviors:\n\u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e : b(\u03c4 ) \u2212\u2192 rH + O(\u03c4 \u22121 )\n1\n\u03c4 \u2192 0\u2212 : b(\u03c4 ) \u2212\u2192 \u2212 + MADM + O(\u03c4 ) .\n\u03c4\n\n(26)\n(27)\n\nSince e\u2212U = \u2212\u03c4 b, using the first order equations we may write\nW =\u2212\n\nd \u2212U\nd\ne =\n(\u03c4 b) = b + \u03c4 \u1e03 ,\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\n7\n\n(28)\n\n\fwhich implies the following asymptotic limits for W :\nlim W = rH = MBR ,\n\n\u03c4 \u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nlim W = MADM \u2265 MBR ,\n\n\u03c4 \u21920\u2212\n\n(29)\n\nwhere MBR denotes the Bertotti-Robinson mass parameter associated with\nthe near-horizon geometry. Let us now show that W is monotonic:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\ndW\n2\n= \u00dc \u2212 (U\u0307) e\u2212U = V \u2212 W 2 eU = 2 g rs \u2202r W \u2202s W eU \u2265 0 ,(30)\nd\u03c4\n\nwhere we have used eq. (23) and the first order equations. We conclude\nthat W is a positive monotonic function decreasing from the value MADM at\nradial infinity, towards the value MBR \u2264 MADM at the horizon. In [19] it was\nshown that for static, spherically symmetric black holes a monotone function\nA(r) always exists such that A(rH ) = SBH , with A(r) decreasing towards the\nhorizon. For the extremal case, W 2 then appears as the appropriate quantity\nto play the role of the c-function.\n\n3\n\nThe prepotential for extremal solutions of\nextended supergravity\n\nIt is our purpose to show that when the extremal black hole is a solution of\nan N > 2 extended supersymmetric theory, where the scalar manifold is a\ncoset G/H, it is possible to find a general expression for W which reproduces\nall the known results concerning the BPS and non-BPS attractor points of\nthe theory (see [2] for a review collecting all the solutions in four dimensions).\nOur results may be extended to the N = 2 case when the special geometry\nis described by homogeneous spaces. For more general models a case by case\ninspection is necessary. Some N = 2 examples have been given in [14].\nWe propose the following:\nX\nW =\n\u03b1M eM .\n(31)\nM\n\nwhere eM \u2208 IR are related to the invariants of the isotropy subgroup H\nbuilt in terms of the complex central and matter charges. Such invariants\nindeed can be expressed in terms of the skew eigenvalues of the matrix of\n8\n\n\fcentral charges ZAB and of the norm of the matter charge vectors ZI that\nwe collectively call {eM }.\nThe real coefficients \u03b1M can be computed by requiring that the potential\n(23), with W given by (31), reproduces the general form taken by the effective\nscalar potential for any extended supersymmetric theory:\n1\nAB\nI\nVBH = ZAB Z + ZI Z .\n2\n\n(32)\n\nHere and in the following A, B are SU(N) R\u2013symmetry group indices while\nthe indices I, J label the fundamental representation of the matter group\nwhen present (namely U(3) for N = 3 and SO(6) in the N = 4 case).\nSince (23) involves the gradient of the prepotential W , the evaluation of VBH\nrequires the knowledge of the differential relations among central and matter\ncharges, for which we refer to [15, 2]. In general, since the equations in the\n\u03b1M are quadratic, their sign is not fixed in principle, but it can be fixed by\nrequiring that the prepotential W is extremized on the black-hole horizon\n\u2202r W |hor = 0.\nIt was observed in [14] that for any VBH it should exist a multiple choice\nof W . Here, using the ansatz (31) we give the explicit expression and the\nprecise number of independent prepotentials for any given extended theory.\nIndeed, as we are going to show by a case by case analysis, there are in\ngeneral up to three independent choices of {\u03b1M } all reproducing the same\nVBH . The various independent solutions for W will reproduce the known\ndifferent BPS and non-BPS solutions for any given theory. Any independent\nchoice of {\u03b1M } would then parametrize a different black-hole solution.\nWe may then adopt two equivalent points of view to find the different\nextremal black-hole attractors: either we study the extrema of VBH , or alternatively we consider the possible inequivalent choices of W compatible with\nthe expression (32) for VBH .\nWe first analyze the N-odd cases, which are easier because the central and\nmatter charges in normal form can all be made real. The cases with N even,\nwhich in general also include a solution with complex charges (corresponding\nto a negative fourth-order invariant of the duality group G) will be analyzed\nafterwords.\n\n9\n\n\f3.1\n\nThe N -odd cases\n\nSince these are the simplest cases, we shall describe the calculations in detail.\nIn the N\u2013even cases the relevant results will be given.\n3.1.1\n\nThe N = 3 case\n\nIn the N = 3 theory the scalar manifold is U(3, n)/[U(3) \u00d7 U(n)] and the\ncentral charge matrix ZAB = \u2212ZBA , A = 1, 2, 3, and matter charges ZI ,\nI = 1, * * * , n; the central and matter charges obey the differential relations\n\u001a\nI\n\u2207ZAB =\nPIAB Z\n(33)\nAB\n\u2207ZI = 21 PIAB Z ,\nwhere PIAB = PIAB,i dz i (i = 1, * * * 3n) is the holomorphic vielbein of U(3, n)/[U(3)\u00d7\nU(n)], \u2207 denotes the U(1)\u2013K\u00e4hler covariant and H\u2013covariant derivative,\nwhere H is the isotropy group of the symmetric spaces G/H repres4nting\nthe scalar manifold of the various N \u2265 3 theories (see [2, 15]).

This in particular implies that eq. (24) cannot have further\nsolutions coming from the vanishing of the second factor, as it can be easily\nshown by an explicit calculation.\n\n11\n\n\f3.1.2\n\nThe prepotential for the N = 5 case\n\nIn this case there are no matter multiplets and the scalar manifold is the\nK\u00e4hler manifold SU(1, 5)/U(5), spanned by the holomorphic vielbein PABCD =\nPABCD,i dz i = \u01ebABCDE P E (with A, i =, * * * 5) and its complex conjugate\nP ABCD = P,\u0131ABCD dz \u0131 .

It may be easily shown by explicit calculation\nthat there are no other solutions to \u2202i VBH = 0 besides \u2202i W = 0 from which\nwe conclude that also in this case the extrema of W give all the extrema of\nVBH .\n\n3.2\n\nThe N -even cases\n\nIn the cases with N = 3 and N = 5 supercharges the central and matter\ncharges ZM \u2261 {ZAB , ZI } in normal form may be chosen all real and non\nnegative. On the other hand, in the N-even cases the normal form of the\nZM contains in general an unfixed overall phase. Since our choice (31) of the\nprepotential is given only in terms of the moduli of the charges, the solution\nfor the coefficents \u03b1M in (31) which reconstruct the effective potential VBH\nimplies in particular that the phase must be fixed at certain values all over the\n13\n\n\fmoduli space. This value is actually the one corresponding to the attractor\ncondition at the horizon.\nOur general ansatz (31) can then be considered as the minimal one reproducing correctly all the attractor points of static extremal black-hole solutions\nin extended four dimensional supergravity. We argue that a refined ansatz\ncould relax the fixing of the phase before extremization.\n3.2.1\n\nThe prepotential for the N = 4 attractors\n\nIn this case the scalar manifold is the coset space\nG/H =\n\nSU(1, 1)\nSO(6, n)\n\u00d7\nU(1)\nSO(6) \u00d7 SO(n)\n\nand the relations among central and matter charges are:\n(\nI\nCD\nDZAB = Z PABI + 12 Z \u01ebABCD P ,\nAB\nDZI = 12 Z PABI + Z I P .\n\n(55)\n\n(56)\n\nWe recall that for this theory the vielbein PABI satisfies the reality condition\nABI\nI\n.\nP\n\u2261 (PABI )\u22c6 = 12 \u01ebABCD PCD\nUsing the U(1) \u00d7 SO(6) \u223c U(4) symmetry of the theory we can bring the\ncentral charges into their normal form [16]\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0\nZ1\n0\n0\n\uf8ec \u2212Z1 0\n0\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nZAB = \uf8ec\n(57)\n\uf8ed 0\n0\n0\nZ2 \uf8f8\n0\n0 \u2212Z2 0\n\nwhere the graviphoton skew-eigenvalues Z1 , Z2 can be chosen real and nonnegative, thus coinciding with their modulus Z1,2 = |Z1,2 | = e1,2 . Further,\nusing an SO(n) transformation it is also possible to reduce the vector of\nmatter charges in such a way that only one real and one complex matter\ncharge are different from zero. Let us call them ZI = \u03c1I ei\u03b8I , I = 1, 2 (with\nthe proviso that one of the phases may be always put to zero).\nWe consider a prepotential W of the form:\nW = a1 e1 + a2 e2 +\n\n2\nX\nI=1\n\n14\n\nbI \u03c1I .\n\n(58)\n\n\fIt encodes the H and G (moduli-dependent) invariants:\n\uf8f1\nAB\n1\n\uf8f4\nI\n\u2261\nZ\nZ\n= (e1 )2 + (e2 )2 ,\n1\nAB\n\uf8f4\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nBC\nDA\n= (e1 )4 + (e2 )4 ,\nI2 \u2261 12 ZAB Z ZCD Z\n\uf8f4\nI \u2261 ZI Z I = \u03c1I \u03c1I ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 3\nI4 \u2261 Re (ZI ZI ) .\n\n(59)\n\nThe potential is related to W by eq.

However, we know that\nthe scalar manifold is embedded in the coset MSK \u2282 Sp(2n + 2)/U(n + 1)\ndue to the symplectic embedding. The n + 1 dressed charges (Z, Zi ) = ZA\ncompose a vector of U(n + 1). For a general special manifold there are many\n(U(n + 1)) invariants (the only request is to build coordinate invariants of\nK\u00e4hler weight zero) which can be constructed in terms of Z and Zi out of\ngi\uf6be , Cijk , and their derivatives and products.\nFor special manifolds which are coset spaces G/H, the invariants are built\nin terms of the invariant tensors of H, and the result is found by a case by\ncase inspection.\nIn the minimal case SU(1, n)/U(n), where the Cijk \u2261 0, the procedure\nto find the prepotential is straightforward.

In this case the flat index I is identified with\nthe antisymmetric couple AB, and the C-tensor, with flat indices is identified\nwith the invariant tensor \u01ebABCDEF [15]. We expect the following invariants\nI\nJ K\nto be involved: ZZ, ZI Z , Z Z ZL ZM CIJK C ILM , |ZI ZJ ZK C IJK |2 .

In this more general situation, we may argue\nthat a possible generalization of the expression for the prepotential W might\ninclude an explicit dependence on the evolution parameter \u03c4 , that is:\nU\u0307 = W (\u03a6, \u03c4 ) eU .\n\n(106)\n\nIndeed, differentiating (13) with respect to \u03c4 , we find:\n\u00dc = (U\u0307)2 + \u1e86 eU ,\n\n(107)\n\n\u1e86 = \u03a6\u0307r \u2202r W + \u2202\u03c4 W .\n\n(108)\n\nwhere now:\nThe (on-shell) expression for VBH is still formally the same as for the extremal\ncase:\nVBH = W 2 + e\u2212U \u1e86 .\n(109)\nHowever, when inserted in (7) the above expression now gives (using (5)):\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n\u00dc \u2212 (U\u0307 )2 = \u03a6\u0307r \u2202r W + \u2202\u03c4 W eU = grs \u03a6\u0307r \u03a6\u0307s \u2212 c2 .\n(110)\n2\nFor \u03a6\u0307r 6= 0, eq.

Indeed, given the general form (3) for the space-time\nmetric, for \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e the first order correction to a generic charged black-hole\nsolution is\n\u0012\n\u00132\nA sinh(c\u03c4 )\n\u22122U\ne\n\u223c\n(113)\n4\u03c0\nc\n\nso that\n\nd\nW = \u2212 e\u2212U = \u2212 cosh(c\u03c4 )\nd\u03c4\n25\n\nr\n\nA\n4\u03c0\n\n(114)\n\n\fgiving\n\u2202\u03c4 W = \u2212c sinh(c\u03c4 )\n\nr\n\nA\n= \u2212c2 e\u2212U .\n4\u03c0\n\n(115)\n\nNote that (114) may also be written as\nW2 =\n\n\u0001\nA\nA\n1 + sinh2 (c\u03c4 ) =\n+ c2 e\u22122U\n4\u03c0\n4\u03c0\n\n(116)\n\nA\nwhich coincides with (112) for W02 = 4\u03c0\n.\nFor the non-extremal cases where eq.s (111) hold, the field equations for\nthe scalar sector are in fact still first order as for the extremal case. To show\nthis, it is however necessary to make a slight modification to the effective\npotential. Indeed, using (111) the effective potential reads\n\nVBH = W 2 + 2 g rs \u2202r W \u2202s W \u2212 c2 e\u22122U .\n\n(117)\n\nBy inserting eq.s (111) in the second order evolution equation for the scalars,\neq. (6), we actually find an inconsistency. However, since the expression\n(109) for the black-hole potential is an on-shell relation, any expression for\nVBH given by\nVBH = W 2 + 2 g rs \u2202r W \u2202s W \u2212 c2 e\u22122U + \u03b1 e\u2212U (\u2202\u03c4 W + c2 e\u2212U ) (118)\nis equivalent to (117). If we redo the calculation of the field equations for the\nscalars (6) with the parametric expression (118), we find that for \u03b1 = 2 it is\nautomatically solved when we use the Ansatz (111) for \u03a6\u0307r . For all the cases\nwhere eq.s (111) hold, we then have the following expression for the effective\npotential in terms of W :\nVBH = W 2 + 2 g rs \u2202r W \u2202s W + 2\u2202\u03c4 W e\u2212U + c2 e\u22122U\n\n(119)\n\nBy inserting the explicit expression (112) in (119) we find\nVBH = W02 + 2 g rs \u2202r W0 \u2202s W0 \u2212\n\nc2 e\u22122U\n2 g rs \u2202r W0 \u2202s W0 . (120)\nW02 + c2 e\u22122U\n\nNote that the extrema of the prepotential W do not extremize VBH , corresponding to the fact that for non-extremal black holes, the attractor mechanism is not expected to be at work nor the horizon to be a fixed point for\nthe scalar fields.\n26\n\n\fHowever, the expression (120) for the effective potential has the feature\nof containing an explicit dependence on the evolution parameter \u03c4 . Such\nbehavior could be acceptable for purely bosonic theories such as fake supergravity [17, 18]. For black holes in supersymmetric theories this clashes with\nthe request that the effective potential be identified with the general expression (8), where it depends on \u03c4 only through the scalars fields. We then have\nto assume that, in the supersymmetric case, (120) is rigorously valid only\nfor the \"double non-extremal\" cases of constant scalars. For more general\nsolutions, at a finite distance from the black-hole horizon we then expect eq.\n(111) to receive corrections. For completely general non-extremal cases, we\ndo not expect to have a first-order description in terms of a prepotential.\nAs a final remark, let us recall that in the BPS case the effective lagrangian\n(10) may be written in terms of a sum of squares, as discussed in [4, 14]. We\nwant to give a similar treatment for general extremal black holes and for all\nthe cases where (111) hold and the effective potential takes the form (119).\nTo this aim, we consider the following quantity:\n1\nK = (U\u0307 \u2212 W eU )2 + grs (\u03a6\u0307r \u2212 2g rl \u2202l W )(\u03a6\u0307s \u2212 2g sm \u2202m W ) \u2265 0 (121)\n2\nUsing (119) we find:\n\nK = Lef f \u2212 R ,\n\n(122)\n\nwhere\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\nd\nd\nU\n2\nR=\u2212\n(2e W ) + c = \u2212 (2eU W + c2 \u03c4 ) .\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\n\n(123)\n\nEq. (122) implies that the effective lagrangian Lef f is bounded from below:\nLef f \u2265 \u2212\n\nd\n(2eU W + c2 \u03c4 )\nd\u03c4\n\nThe extremum value Lef f = R is\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 U\u0307\n\u03a6\u0307r\n\uf8f3\n\u2202\u03c4 W\n\n(124)\n\nrealized on-shell for\n= W eU\n= 2g rl \u2202l W\n= \u2212c2 e\u2212U\n27\n\n(125)\n\n\fUnder our hypothesis, (111), eq.s (125) are always verified and (124) then\nimplies, on-shell, that\nLef f = \u2212\n\nd\n(2eU W + c2 \u03c4 )\nd\u03c4\n\n(126)\n\nis a topological quantity characterizing the extremal solution\nZ 0\n2\nSon\u2212shell =\nd\u03c4 Lef f = \u2212[2U\u0307 + c2 \u03c4 ]\u03c4\u03c4 =0\n\u2192\u2212\u221e = \u22122(MADM \u2212 c) + 2c \u03c4 |\u2212\u221e .\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(127)\n\nThe non extremal infinite contribution from c2 may be understood as a \"vacuum energy\" contribution to the action.\nOur result generalizes the argument for \"non-extremal but BPS solutions\"\ndiscussed in [18] to cases where the scalar fields have a non trivial radial evolution. In [18], it is shown that the effective two dimensional model describing the non-extremal but BPS black hole has a supersymmetric completion\nwhere the first order equations play the role of Killing spinor equations, even\nif there is an obstruction to the four dimensional uplift of this effective supersymmetric model. It would be interesting to perform the same analysis\nfor the class of non-extremal black holes defined by the first order equations\n(111). This is left to a future investigation.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Anna Ceresole, Gianguido Dall'Agata, Sergio Ferrara and Sandip\nTrivedi for interesting discussions.\nWork supported in part by the European Community's Human Potential\nProgram under contract MRTN-CT-2004-005104 'Constituents, fundamental\nforces and symmetries of the universe', in which the authors are associated\nto Torino University, and from MIUR PRIN project 2005.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
