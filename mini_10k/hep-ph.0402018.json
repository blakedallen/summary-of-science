This is due to the real photon in the final state\nbeing an elementary (point-like) particle rather than a\nbound state like a meson or more complicated configurations. The skewed parton distributions are generally\ndefined via the Fourier transform of matrix elements of\nrenormalized, non-local twist-two operators (for a pedagogical view, see Refs. [4, 5]). These composite operators\ncontain only two elementary fields of the theory, which\nare placed at different positions becoming then non-local\nand operating in unequal momentum nucleon states.\nHence skewedness takes into account dynamical correlations between partons with different momenta. The\nhigh energy situation at HERA gives the important opportunity to constrain them as well as to study the evolution with virtuality of the resulting quark and gluon distributions. There are several representations for skewed\nparton distributions [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], which can be used\nto compute the relevant observables in DVCS (or other\nexclusive processes) through a factorization theorem [11].\nThey are input in numerical solutions of the renormalization group or evolution equations (see e.g. [12]), producing very reliable predictions up to NLO level [13]\nOn the other hand, the color dipole models have\nalso been successful in describing DVCS observables\n[14, 15, 16]. There, the main degrees of freedom are\nthe color dipoles, which interact with the nucleon target via gluonic exchange. This interaction is modeled\nthrough the dipole-nucleon cross section, which can include QCD dynamical effects given by DGLAP, BFKL or\nnon-linear high energy evolution equations (parton sat-\n\n1 E-mail:lfavart@ulb.ac.be\n2 E-mail:magnus@if.ufrgs.br,\n\nmagnus@ufpel.edu.br\n\nuration). Skewedness effects are not considered in the\ncurrent dipole models and this is one of the goals of the\npresent analysis, making use of a simple phenomenological parametrisation to estimate them. Moreover, the\nQCD DGLAP evolution can be introduced, which improves the data description in the large Q2 kinematic region accessible in the recent ZEUS DVCS measurements\n[3].\nThis note is organized as follows. In the next section,\nwe recall the main formulas for the color dipole formalism applied to DVCS. For the dipole cross section we have\nconsidered the saturation model [17], which produces a\nunified and intuitive description of DIS [17], diffractive\nDIS [18], vector meson production [19], Drell-Yan [20, 21]\nand DVCS [16]. In particular, the restriction to the transverse part of the photon wave function, due to the real\nfinal state photon in DVCS, enhances the contribution of\nlarger dipole configurations and therefore the sensitivity\nto soft content and to the transition between hard/soft\nregimes. Such a feature provides a particularly relevant\ntest of saturation models. Moreover, the approach includes all twist resummation, in contrast with the leading twist approximations. In the Sec. 3, we discuss the\nrole played by the QCD evolution and skewedness in the\nhigh virtuality kinematic region. We also perform a systematic analysis in order to investigate to what extent\nthe distinct models improve the data description. These\nissues have implications in the correct determination of\nthe t slope parameter B, whose value has never been\nmeasured for DVCS. Finally, the last section summarizes\nour main results.\n\nII.\n\nDVCS CROSS SECTION IN DIPOLE\nPICTURE\n\nIn the proton rest frame, the DVCS process can be\nseen as a succession in time of three factorisable subprocesses: i) the photon fluctuates in a quark-antiquark\npair, ii) this color dipole interacts with the proton target, iii) the quark pair annihilates in a real photon.\n\n\f2\n\nIm A (s, t = 0) =\n\nZ1\n0\n\ndz\n\nZ\u221e\n\nd2 r H(z, r, Q2 ) \u03c3dip (x\u0303, r 2 ) (1)\n\n0\n\n6\u03b1em X 2 \b 2\nH=\nef [z + (1 \u2212 z)2 ] \u03b51 K1 (\u03b51 r) \u03b52 K1 (\u03b52 r)\n4 \u03c02\n\n10\n+\n\nZEUS 96\u221200 e p\n\u2212\nZEUS 98\u221299 e p\n\u22122\nSAT\u2212MOD (B = 4 GeV )\n\n8\n\n*\n\n\u03c3 (\u03b3 p \u2212> \u03b3p) [nb]\n\nThe usual kinematic variables are the \u03b3 \u2217 p c.m.s. energy squared s = W 2 = (p + q)2 , where p and q are the\nproton and the photon momenta respectively, the photon virtuality squared Q2 = \u2212q 2 and the Bjorken scale\nxBj = Q2 /(W 2 + Q2 ).\nThe imaginary part of the DVCS amplitude at zero\nmomentum transfer in the color dipole formalism is expressed in the simple way [16],\n\n2\n\n2\n\nQ =9.6 GeV\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\nW [GeV]\n\nf\n\n+\n\nm2f\n\nK0 (\u03b51 r) K0 (\u03b52 r) ,\n\n(2) FIG. 1: The DVCS cross section as a function of c.m.s. energy,\n\nwhere H(z, r, Q21,2 ) = \u03a8\u2217T (z, r, Q21 = Q2 ) \u03a8T (z, r, Q22 =\n0), with \u03a8T being the light cone photon wave function\nfor transverse photons . Here, Q1 = Q is the virtuality of\nthe incoming photon, whereas Q2 is the virtuality of the\noutgoing real photon. The longitudinal piece does not\ncontribute at Q22 = 0. The relative transverse separation\nof the pair (dipole) is labeled by r and z, (1 \u2212 z), are\nthe longitudinal momentum fractions of the quark (antiquark).

The K0,1 are the McDonald functions and summation is taken over the quark\nflavors.\nLet us summarize the main features and expressions\nfrom the saturation model, which will be used here to\nestimate the DVCS cross section. A previous analysis\ncompared to H1 data can be found in Ref. [16]. The saturation model reproduces color transparency behavior,\n\u03c3dip \u223c r2 , for small dipoles, whereas it gives a constant\nbehavior for large ones. This is rendered by a dipole cross\nsection having an eikonal-like form,\nh\n\u0010\n\u0011i\nQ2 (x\u0303) r 2\n\u03c3dip (x\u0303, r2 ) = \u03c30 1 \u2212 exp \u2212 sat 4\n, (3)\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0001\u03bb\n4 m2\nQ2sat (x\u0303) = xx\u03030 GeV2 , x\u0303 = xBj 1 + Q2f , (4)\n\nW\u03b3p . The curve is the result for the saturation model for fixed\nslope B = 4 GeV\u22122 .\n\nwhere the energy scale is defined as \u03bc2 = C/r2 + \u03bc20 .\nThe parameters are determined from a fit to DIS data,\nwith the following initial condition for LO DGLAP evolution, x G(x, \u03bc2 = 1 GeV2 ) = Ag x\u2212\u03bbg (1 \u2212 x)5.6 . The\nflavor number is taken to be equal to 3. The overall normalization \u03c30 = 23.03 mb is kept fixed (labeled fit 1 in\nRef. [22]). The DGLAP evolution improves the data description in large Q2 regime and brings the model close to\nthe theoretical high energy non-linear QCD approaches.\nHaving a suitable model for the dipole cross section,\nas in Eq. (3) or Eq. (5), we can use Eq. (1) and then\ncompute the final expression for the DVCS cross section\nas,\n\u03c3(\u03b3 \u2217 p \u2192 \u03b3 p) =\n\n\u0001\n1 [ Im A(s, 0) ]2\n1 + \u03c12 , (6)\nB\n16 \u03c0\n\nwhere B is the t slope parameter (the behavior in |t| is\nsupposed to obey a simple exponential parametrisation).\nIn our further calculations, the real part is included\nvia the usual estimate \u03c1 = tan(\u03c0\u03bb/2), where \u03bb = \u03bb(Q2 )\nis the effective power of the imaginary part of the amplitude. We have fitted it for 1 \u2264 Q2 \u2264 100 GeV2 in\nthe form \u03bbeff (Q2 ) = 0.2 + 0.0107 ln2 (Q2 /2.48). It can be\nverified that when it rises to \u223c 0.3 at high virtualities\nthe contribution of the real part can reach 20% of the\ntotal cross section. In the next section we compute the\ncross section above using the two versions for the saturation model and contrast them with the recent DVCS\nZEUS data, which includes data points with larger Q2\nvalues than the previous H1 data. Moreover, we present\na simple way to introduce skewedness effects into the calculation.\n\nwhere the saturation scale Qsat (x) (energy dependent)\ndefines the onset of the saturation phenomenon and sets\nthe interface between soft/hard domains. The parameters were obtained from a fit to the HERA data producing \u03c30 = 23.03 (29.12) mb, \u03bb = 0.288 (0.277) and\nx0 = 3.04 * 10\u22124 (0.41 * 10\u22124) for a 3-flavor (4-flavor) analysis [17]. An additional parameter is the effective light\nquark mass, mf = 0.14 GeV. For the 4-flavor analysis,\nthe charm quark mass is considered to be mc = 1.5 GeV.\nThe QCD evolution to the original saturation model\nwas implemented recently [22] (BGBK), where the dipole\ncross section now depends on the gluon distribution in a\nIII.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nGlauber-Gribov inspired way,\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u03c0 2 r 2 \u03b1s (\u03bc2 ) x\u0303 G(x\u0303, \u03bc2 )\nIn Fig. 1 is shown the result for the saturation model,\n2\n\u03c3dip (x\u0303, r ) = \u03c30 1 \u2212 exp \u2212\n,(5)\nEq.

The\nparameters of the 4-flavor fit have been used, producing\ngood agreement with a fixed value for the slope, B = 4\nGeV\u22122 .\nIn Fig. 2-a, we show the result of the saturation model\nfor the behavior with Q2 at fixed energy, W\u03b3p = 89\nGeV. In order to illustrate the sensitivity on the slope\nvalue, both values B = 4 GeV\u22122 (solid line) and B = 6.5\nGeV\u22122 (dot-dashed line) are shown1 . Although the sta2\ntistical errors are large, it seems that for Q2>\n\u223c40 GeV ,\nthe model underestimates the experimental data. This\ncan indicate two things: (a) the slope diminishes as the\nvirtuality increases or, (b) some additional effect appears\nat higher Q2 . In order to investigate the first hypothesis, we compute the cross section using a Q2 dependent\nslope, proposed in Ref. [23]. That is, B(Q2 ) = B0 [1 \u2212\n0.15 ln(Q2 /2)] GeV\u22122 which is based on the diffractive\nelectroproduction of \u03c1. Such a slope dependence allows a\ngood description of the Q2 dependence of the cross section up to the highest measured values and gives a good\nnormalisation for B0 = 5 GeV\u22122 .\nIn order to investigate whether a QCD evolution improves the description, we show in Fig. 2-b the estimate\nusing the BGBK dipole cross section, Eq. (5) as a function of Q2 using fixed slope values. There is an effect in\nthe overall normalization and a slower decrease at large\nQ2 in contrast with the model without QCD evolution reproducing well the ZEUS measurement for all Q2 . This\nsuggests that DGLAP evolution starts to be important\n\n[1] It is worth mentioning that a slope B = 6.5 GeV\u22122 (4-flavor) was\nable to describe correctly the H1 experimental data for Q2 \u2264 40\nGeV2 [16].\n\nfor the large Q2 points measured by ZEUS. A comparison\nof the different Q2 behavior independently of the normalisation question is presented at the end of this section.\nFurthermore, we are motivated to investigate the importance of the skewedness effects in the DVCS process\nusing the previous results. Here, we follow the approximation proposed in Ref. [24], where the ratio of offforward to forward parton distributions are obtained relying on simple arguments. The behavior of those ratios\nare given explicitly by [24],\n\u0001\n22\u03bb+3 \u0393 \u03bb + 25\n2\nRq,g (Q ) = \u221a\n,\n(7)\n\u03c0 \u0393 (\u03bb + 3 + p)\nwhere p = 0 for quarks and p = 1 for gluons, and where\n\u03bb is the exponent of the x\u2212\u03bb behavior of the input diagonal parton distribution. It should be noticed that the\nskewed effect is much larger for singlet quarks than gluons. In the following, it will be assumed that the DVCS\ncross section is lead by a two gluon exchange. In our\nfurther computations, we use \u03bb = \u03bb(Q2 ) as discussed in\nthe previous section and the skewedness effect is given by\nmultiplying the total cross section by the factor Rg2 (Q2 ).\nOnce the effective power increases as a function of Q2 ,\nthe skewedness effects could enhance the cross section by\na factor two if values of \u03bbef f \u2243 0.4 are reached at larger\nvirtualities. In Fig. 3-a we show the result using the\nsaturation model (4-flavor) and the skewedness correction, Eq. (7). The same analysis is shown for the BGBK\nmodel in Fig. 3-b. The main effect is to increase the\noverall normalization of the cross section by about 40%\nand only slightly modify the large Q2 behaviour. Again,\nthis will be shown more clearly and independently of the\nnormalisation at the end of this section.\nFor completeness, we have investigated two additional\nversions of the implementation of the skewedness correction factor.

First, we have imposed skewedness correction only for small dipoles by introducing Rg (\u03bbGBW =\n0.277) in the exponent of Eq. (3) (dotted line). This\nis to prevent correction to the nonperturbative (large\ndipoles) piece of the dipole cross section. Further, we\nalso test the rough approximation x\u0303 = 0.41 xBj (dashed\nline), which comes from a simplified hypothesis \u03c3dip \u223c\n\u2212\u03bb\nRg (\u03bb) (xBj ) . The conclusion is that these two different implementation of the skewedness correction do not\nmake sensible changes w.r.t. the first skewedness correction neither in normalisation nor in Q2 dependence for\nthe presently covered kinematic range and precision of\nthe measurement.\nAt this stage, some comments are probably needed.\nThe estimate for skewedness taken into account above\nis an approximation as currently we have no accurate\ntheoretical arguments how to compute it from first principles within the color dipole formalism. A consistent\n\napproach would be to compute the scattering amplitude\nin the non-forward case (the non-forward photon wave\nfunction has been recently obtained in Ref. [25]). In\n~\nthis case, the dipole cross section, \u03c3dip (x1 , x2 , r, \u2206),\ndepends on the light cone momenta x1 and x2 carried\nby the exchanged gluons, respectively, and on the total\n~ ( additional informatransverse momentum transfer \u2206\n~ is needed for the QCD\ntion about the behavior on \u2206\nPomeron and proton impact factor). The forward dipole\n~ = 0. In the\ncross section is recovered at x1 = x2 and \u2206\nfuture, an experimental constraint for the nonforward\ndipole cross section should be feasible with increasing\nstatistics on DVCS and exclusive (diffractive) vector\nmeson production.\nTo close this section, as the slope parameter B has\nnever been measured for DVCS, we compare the different estimates presented in a systematic way separately\nfor the effect on the Q2 dependence and the effect on the\noverall normalisation. To compare the Q2 dependences,\nwe normalize all models to describe the ZEUS data point\nat the lowest Q2 value, i.e. Q2 = 7.5 GeV2 . Further, we\nplot the ratio of each model to our baseline model SATMOD as a function of Q2 . Such a procedure allows a Q2\ndependence comparison independently of the normalization effect. These ratios are shown in Fig. 5-a, where the\npoints (triangles-up) are the ratio of the ZEUS data to\nSAT-MOD including the error bars for the statistical (inner) and sum in quadrature of statistical and systematic\n(outer) uncertainties.\nOn the other hand, to compare the effect on the normalisation we show the slope value needed to describe the\nlowest Q2 value of the ZEUS data points B0 = B(Q2 =\n7.5 GeV2 ). They are shown in Fig. 5-b. For completeness, we also present the measured slope values for vector\nmeson production at that virtuality, both for \u03c10 and J/\u03a8\nmesons as indications of typical values for respectively\n\n\f5\n8\nZEUS DATA/SAT\u2212MOD\nSAT\u2212MOD + SKEW\n2\nSAT\u2212MOD + B(Q )\nBGBK\nBGBK + SKEW\n\n2.5\n\n7\n\nBGBK + SKEWED\n2\n\nB0 = B(Q =7.5 GeV )\n\n2\n\n6\n\nSAT\u2212MOD + SKEWED\n5\n\nBGBK\n\n2\n\nRATIO (MODELS/SAT\u2212MOD)\n\n3\n\n1.5\n\n4\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n0.5\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n2\n\n2\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nQ [GeV ]\n\na)\n\n1\n\n2\n\nSAT\u2212MOD, SAT\u2212MOD + B(Q )\n2\n\n2\n\nB\u03c1 (Q =7.5 GeV )\n2\n2\nBJ /\u03a8 (Q =7.5 GeV )\n\n00.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.811.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.822.2\n2.4\n2.6\n2.833.2\n3.4\n3.6\n3.844.2\n4.4\n4.6\n4.855.2\n5.4\n5.6\n5.866.2\n6.4\n6.6\n6.877.2\n7.4\n7.6\n7.88\nx\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 5: The ratio (a) MODELS/SAT-MOD as a function of Q2 (models normalized to ZEUS data at Q2 = 7.5 GeV2 ), and (b)\nslope values of the models at Q2 = 7.5 GeV2 and slopes of heavy and light vector mesons.\n\nlight and heavy mesons using the simple parametrisation:\n!\n14\nB = 0.60\n,\n(8)\n0.26 + 1\n(Q2 + MV2 )\nwhere MV is the meson mass.\nFrom these comparisons, we conclude that several\nmodels can account for the measured Q2 dependence\n(SAT-MOD+B(Q2 ), SAT-MOD+SKEW and BGBK, as\nwell as combination of several of those effects) which\nare not distinguishable with the present experimental\nprecision. The difference between the models is much\nmore pronounced in the prediction of the cross section\nvalue, or in other terms, in the B value needed to describe the integrated cross section over the available Q2\nrange. If the change in normalisation is small for the inclusion of a Q2 dependence in B, the effect is of the order\nof 12% for BGBK with respect to the basic SAT-MOD\nand of 40% for the skewedness effect (SKEW) and still\nlarger when the different effect are combined (60% for\nBGBK+SKEW).\nIn summary, these issues show clearly the importance\nof a measurement of the t slope parameter B.\n\nby the color dipoles formalism. In particular, the saturation model does an excellent job in the current experimental kinematic domain. To achieve a good description\nof the data up the the highest Q2 , the original saturation\nmodel can be supplemented by QCD evolution, an additional dependence of B on Q2 and skewedness effects.\nThese effects modify in a sensitive way the absolute cross\nsection (10-60%). Measurement of the t slope parameter B would already allow to discriminate among the\ndifferent theoretical predictions with an amount of data\ncomparable to the present ZEUS measurement.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nIt has been shown that the DVCS cross section at\nHERA can be described by the simple picture rendered\n\nM.V.T.M. thanks the CERN Theory Division, where\npart of this work was performed, for the hospitality and\nfinancial support.
