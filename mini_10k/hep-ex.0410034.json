Measurements of Rb have been made at\nthe Z peak and at higher energies [2]. At the Z resonance, where fermion-pair production\nis dominated by Z decays, measurements of Rb provide a precise determination of the\nratio of the Z \u2192 bb partial width to the hadronic width1 Rb0 = \u0393bb /\u0393had . This quantity is\nof particular interest because of its unique sensitivity to electroweak radiative corrections;\nwhile sensitive to the top-quark mass, its dependence on other parameters, for example\nthe Higgs boson mass and the strong coupling constant, is negligible [2]. Above the Z\npeak, the pure Z cross-section decreases and the contributions of photon exchange and\n\u03b3\u2013Z interference become important. Possible new physics at a high energy scale might\nmanifest itself as a deviation from the Standard Model prediction.\nIn this paper, measurements of Rb at energies above the Z resonance are presented.\nThe data \u221a\nwere taken by the OPAL detector at the LEP e+ e\u2212 collider, at centre-of-mass\nenergies, s, ranging from 182 GeV to 209 GeV, during the LEP2 programme.\nAbove the Z peak a significant fraction of the observed fermion-pair events comes\nfrom radiative return to the Z through initial-state photon radiation. Only non-radiative\nevents are considered here, according to the definition used by OPAL in the analysis of\nfermion-pair production at LEP2 [3]:\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2022 An effective centre-of-mass energy s\u2032 > 0.85 s, where s\u2032 is defined as the square\nof the mass of the \u03b3/Z propagator.\n1\n\nRb0 is the partial width ratio for Z decays and not the cross-section ratio measured in this paper. It\nis smaller than the cross-section ratio at the peak of the Z resonance by 0.0002.\n\n3\n\n\f\u2022 The predicted contribution of interference between initial- and final-state photon\nradiation is removed.\nAt high energies, additional background sources also arise, mainly from W+ W\u2212 and\nZZ decaying to four-fermion final states.\nBecause of the limited statistics due to the low cross-section at LEP2, the double-tag\ntechnique as used at the Z resonance [4] is not optimal. Instead the measurement reported\nhere relies on a single-tag method, and uses a sophisticated tagging algorithm based on\nlepton, lifetime and event-shape information to identify bb events. This algorithm is more\nefficient and has a higher purity than the one used in our previous measurement [5], where\nRb was measured up to 189 GeV. Hence the 183 GeV and 189 GeV results reported here\nsupersede the previous values, while the measurements at higher energy are reported here\nby OPAL for the first time.\n\n2\n\nThe OPAL detector, data sample and simulation\n\nA detailed description of the OPAL detector can be found elsewhere [6]. For this analysis,\nthe most relevant parts of the detector are the silicon micro-vertex detector, the tracking chambers, the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and the muon chambers.\nThe micro-vertex detector is essential for the reconstruction of secondary vertices. The\ncentral detector provides precise measurements of the momenta of charged particles from\nthe curvature of their trajectories in a magnetic field of 0.435 T. In addition, it allows\nthe identification of charged particles through a combination of the measurement of the\nspecific energy loss dE/dx and the momentum. The electromagnetic calorimeter consists\nof 11 704 lead glass blocks, which completely cover the azimuthal2 range up to polar angles of | cos \u03b8| < 0.98. Almost the entire detector is surrounded with four layers of muon\nchambers, after approximately one metre of iron from the magnet return yoke, which is instrumented as a hadron calorimeter. Luminosity is determined using small-angle Bhabha\nscattering in the forward calorimeter [3].\n\n2.1\n\nData sample\n\nThe data used in this analysis were collected by the OPAL detector at LEP during 19972000, at centre-of-mass energies between 182 GeV and 209 GeV. They are grouped into\neight energy points. The centre-of-mass energies and integrated luminosities of the data\nsamples are summarized in Table 1.\n2\n\nThe OPAL coordinate system is defined as a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system, with the x\naxis pointing in the plane of the LEP collider toward the centre of the ring, the z axis in the direction of\nthe electron beam, and \u03b8 and \u03c6 defined as the usual spherical polar coordinates.\n\n4\n\n\fNominal Energy Energy Range (GeV)\n183\n181.7 - 184.0\n189\n188.5 - 189.1\n191.4 - 191.7\n192\n196\n195.4 - 195.8\n200\n199.3 - 199.9\n202\n201.5 - 202.0\n205\n204.5 - 205.5\n207\n205.5 - 208.6\n\n\u221a\nh si (GeV) Integrated Luminosity (pb\u22121 )\n182.7\n56\n188.6\n185\n191.6\n29\n195.5\n77\n199.5\n78\n201.6\n36\n205.3\n74\n206.8\n137\n\nTable 1: The nominal energy, energy range, luminosity-weighted mean centre-of-mass\nenergy and integrated luminosity of the data used in the analysis.\n\n2.2\n\nSimulation\n\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulation is used to estimate the selection efficiency for bb events\nand to evaluate backgrounds. MC samples are generated at the nominal centre-of-mass\nenergies given in Table 1. The KK2F program [7] is used to simulate e+ e\u2212 \u2192 qq(\u03b3) events.\nFour-fermion background events are simulated with the grc4f generator [8] or with the\nKoralW [9] program with the grc4f matrix elements. The hadronization is performed by\nthe Pythia 6.150 [10] string model, and heavy quark fragmentation is modelled according\nto the Peterson fragmentation scheme [11] with parameters tuned according to [12]. All\nthe MC samples are passed through a detailed simulation of the OPAL detector [13].\nThe Standard Model cross-section predictions are calculated using Zfitter 6.36 [14].\nZfitter is used to calculate the Standard Model value of Rc , the ratio of the cross-section\nfor charm-quark pair production to the hadronic cross-section, at which the resulting Rb\nis quoted, and to calculate Rb for comparison of the theoretical predictions with the\nmeasured values. Zfitter is also used for estimating the effects of interference between\ninitial- and final-state photon radiation, as described in Section 3.4.\n\n3\n\nAnalysis procedure\n\nThe measurement of Rb starts by selecting non-radiative hadronic events, applying fiducial\ncuts and rejecting four-fermion background events. The number of selected events, Nhad ,\nis corrected for background and for the efficiency of the selection cuts to yield a corrected\nnumber of non-radiative hadronic events, Nqq . The background includes the residual\nfour-fermion\nbackground and feedthrough of events with lower effective centre-of-mass\n\u221a\nenergy, s\u2032 . The contribution from interference between initial- and final-state radiation\nis also removed. A b-tagging algorithm is applied to the selected events, and the number\nof tagged events, Ntag , is similarly corrected for the same background contributions and\ninterference to obtain Nbb , which still contains contributions from cc and light-quark-pair\n\n5\n\n\fevents. Rb is then calculated using:\nRb =\n\nNbb /Nqq \u2212 \u01ebc Rc \u2212 (1 \u2212 Rc )\u01ebuds\n,\n\u01ebb \u2212 \u01ebuds\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u01ebb,c,uds are the efficiencies for non-radiative bb, cc and light-quark-pair events to\npass the selection criteria and the b-tagging algorithm.\nIn the following sections, we describe the selection of high quality non-radiative hadronic\nevents, the rejection of four fermion background (Section 3.1), and the tagging algorithm\nused to select events originating from e+ e\u2212 \u2192 bb (Section 3.2). This is followed by the\ndescription of the residual background estimation (Section 3.3). The correction for interference is discussed in Section 3.4, and finally the calculation of Rb is presented (Section\n3.5). The systematic uncertainties are described in Section 4, and the final results and\nconclusion are given in Section 5.\n\n3.1\n\nHadronic event selection\n\nHadronic events, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3/Z \u2192 qq, are selected based on the number of reconstructed\ncharged particle tracks and the energy deposited in the calorimeters [15]. Further requirements follow, demanding at least seven tracks and that the polar angle of the thrust axis,\n\u03b8thr , satisfy | cos \u03b8thr | < 0.9; the thrust axis is calculated from all tracks and clusters\nand\n\u221a\ncorrected for double-counting as in [16]. The effective centre-of-mass energy, s\u2032 , of the\ne+ e\u2212 collision\nq is estimated as described in Ref. [3], and non-radiative hadronic events are\nselected if s\u2032 /s > 0.85. For the centre-of-mass energies analysed in this paper, the production cross-section of W+ W\u2212 events is comparable to that of non-radiative qq events.\nThe production cross-section of ZZ events is about an order of magnitude smaller. Using\nthe same techniques as in [17], events are rejected if they are identified as W+ W\u2212 events.\nThe number of events at each energy selected by the above cuts (Nhad ) is given in\nTable 2. Typical efficiencies, including the \u2248 90% efficiency of the cos \u03b8thr cut, are 77%\nfor bb and 80% for lighter (u, d, s and c) qq events. About 14% of the Nhad sample are\nexpected to be bb events. The selection of non-radiative events is less efficient for bb final\nstates than for other flavours because of the generally larger missing energy due to the\nneutrinos in semileptonic b and c hadron decays. The remaining four-fermion background\nis estimated to be about 6% of the selected hadronic events.\n\n3.2\n\nb-tagging\n\nIn e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3/Z \u2192 bb events, the quark and the anti-quark are typically boosted in\nopposite directions, and the subsequent hadronization is largely independent. In this\nanalysis, each event is divided into two hemispheres defined by a plane that is orthogonal\nto the thrust direction.\nWe use a hemisphere-based b-tagger designed for LEP2 Higgs searches [18], where the\ntagging of bb events is based on three nearly independent properties of the b-hadron and\n6\n\n\fits decay products: a lepton from a semileptonic b-hadron decay, the long lifetime, and\nkinematic differences between b-hadron decays and fragmentation in uu, dd, ss events, due\nto the hard fragmentation of the b-hadron and the high multiplicity of its decay products.\nFor the lepton tag, semileptonic b-hadron decays are identified from their resultant\nelectron or muon and the lepton momentum is used as the b-tag variable. Electrons are\nidentified using an artificial neural network (ANN) [4] while muons are identified using\ninformation from the muon chambers in association with the tracking chambers, as in [19].\nElectrons from photon conversions are rejected using an additional ANN described in [20].\nFor the lifetime tag, secondary vertices are reconstructed. Variables based on the\nvertex significance (the distance between the reconstructed primary and secondary vertices divided by the corresponding uncertainty) and the impact parameters of the tracks\nassociated with the vertex are combined using an ANN scheme as in [18].\nFor the kinematic tag, three variables are combined using another ANN: the number of\ndetected particles in the central part of the hemisphere, the angle between the hemisphere\naxis and its boosted sphericity axis, and the C parameter [21], the latter two being\ncalculated in the rest frame of all the particles associated with the hemisphere.\nIn each hemisphere, the output of the lepton tag, the lifetime ANN and the kinematic ANN are combined with an unbinned likelihood calculation [22], and the likelihoods\nb\nc\nuds\nb\nLbhemi1 , Lchemi1 , Luds\nhemi1 , Lhemi2 , Lhemi2 , Lhemi2 are obtained. The likelihood Lhemi1 is the probability for the first hemisphere to contain a b quark. Lbhemi2 is the same probability for\nc(uds)\nthe second hemisphere, and Lhemi1(2) are the corresponding probabilities for c-quark (light\nquarks). The two hemispheres' outputs are then combined into a single event b-tagging\nlikelihood variable Levent , using\nLevent =\n\nrb Lbhemi1 Lbhemi2\n.\nuds\nrb Lbhemi1 Lbhemi2 + rc Lchemi1 Lchemi2 + ruds Luds\nhemi1 Lhemi2\n\nThe normalization parameters are set to rb = 0.165, rc = 0.253 and ruds = 0.582, which\nare the Zfitter theoretical predictions for Rb , Rc and Ruds at about 190 GeV. The\nsame values are used for all data sets. The number of events, Ntag , satisfying a b-tagging\ncut of Levent > 0.3 is determined; this cut value minimizes the total uncertainty in the\nmeasurement of Rb . Typical efficiencies for the b-tagger in the hadronic event sample are\n65%, 6.3% and 1.5% for bb, cc and light-quark pair events respectively; for the residual\nfour-fermion events the tagging efficiency is about 5%. On average, 77% of the tagged\nsample is expected to be bb events. The distribution of Levent for the 182\u2013209 GeV data is\nshown in Figure 1, together with the expectation from the Monte Carlo. Good agreement\nbetween the data and the Monte Carlo is observed.\n\n3.3\n\nBackground estimation\n\nThe residual four-fermion background is estimated from Monte Carlo simulation and\nsubtracted from the number of selected hadronic (Nhad ) and b-tagged (Ntag ) events. It\nis 6.5% for the hadronic event sample and 2.5% for the b-tagged sample.

The arrow indicates the cut used.\n\n8\n\n\fcontribution to the four-fermion background originates from W+ W\u2212 and ZZ final states,\nwith only 5% coming from non-W+ W\u2212 and non-ZZ events.\nBackgrounds from two-photon collisions and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 events were found to be\nnegligible. Theqselected event sample has a small contamination from radiative hadronic\nevents where s\u2032 /s was overestimated. This contamination is estimated using Monte\nCarlo simulation and subtracted from Nhad and Ntag when calculating Nqq and Nbb .\nSince both the b-tagged and the hadronic samples include such contamination, the effect\non the measured value of Rb is small. About\nevents and 4%\n\u221a 3% of the selected hadronic\n\u221a\nof the b-tagged events have a true value of s\u2032 smaller than 0.85 s.\nThe contributions from non-radiative cc and light-quark-pair events that are b-tagged\nare taken into account by the two negative terms in the numerator of equation 1. The\nsecondary production of heavy quarks, commonly referred to as gluon splitting, can also\nlead to primary light-quark-pair events being selected by the b-tagging algorithm. This\ncontribution is fully accounted for by the efficiencies in equation 1 if the rates of this\nproduction in the Monte Carlo are correct. These rates were measured at LEP1 [23\u201325].\nWe extrapolate the measured values to the higher energies using theoretical predictions\ngiven in [10,26,27]. We obtain\nproduction rates per hadronic event, gcc = 0.064\u00b10.010 and\n\u221a\ngbb = 0.0065\u00b10.0015 at s = 200 GeV where the uncertainties include the uncertainty on\nthe measurements and the variation of the theoretical models used for the extrapolation\nto higher energy. The default Monte Carlo values are gcc = 0.032 and gbb = 0.0053. We\ncorrect the value of gcc in the Monte Carlo according to the extrapolated value. Since\nthe Monte Carlo value of gbb agrees with the data we do not correct the Monte Carlo for\ngbb but take the difference between the Monte Carlo value and the maximal extrapolated\nrate (0.0053 \u2212 0.0080) as the corresponding systematic uncertainty.\n\n3.4\n\nSubtraction of interference between initial- and final-state\nphoton radiation\n\nThe interference cross-section is defined as the difference between the cross-section including interference between initial- and final-state photon radiation and the cross-section\nexcluding interference. It is calculated using Zfitter with the Standard Model value of\nthe forward backward asymmetry, for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 bb, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 cc and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 uu, dd, ss, in\nbins of cos \u03b8 where \u03b8 is the angle between the fermion direction and the direction of the e\u2212\nbeam. The interference cross-section can be positive or negative, depending on the value\nof \u03b8. The thrust axis gives a good estimate of the fermion direction, so we assume that\nthe interference correction estimated in bins of cos \u03b8 can be applied in bins of cos \u03b8thr . The\nfractions of b, c and uds events in the hadronic and b-tagged samples are estimated from\nMonte Carlo samples generated excluding interference. The interference cross-section for\neach flavour is then weighted according to the estimated flavour composition, and the\nresulting numbers of events are subtracted from the number of b-tagged events and from\nthe number of qq events to obtain Nbb and Nqq , which appear in equation 1. These corrections are typically 0.3% for the hadronic sample and \u22120.5% for the b-tagged sample.\nThe uncertainty on the above procedure is discussed in Section 4.1.3 and given in Table 3.\n\n9\n\n\fData set\n183\n189\n192\n196\n200\n202\n205\n207\n\nNhad Ntag\n1172 185\n3496 447\n573\n80\n1343 182\n1312 166\n591\n72\n1124 136\n2046 251\n\nNqq\n1199.8\n3561.1\n584.7\n1370.6\n1333.9\n604.6\n1140.6\n2078.5\n\nNbb\n176.1\n422.7\n76.4\n172.7\n157.3\n68.3\n128.0\n237.5\n\n\u01ebb\n0.60\n0.58\n0.58\n0.56\n0.58\n0.56\n0.55\n0.54\n\n\u01ebc\n0.062\n0.059\n0.064\n0.060\n0.061\n0.062\n0.061\n0.057\n\n\u01ebuds\n0.012\n0.012\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n\nRcSM\n0.2532\n0.2551\n0.2560\n0.2570\n0.2581\n0.2585\n0.2592\n0.2597\n\nRb \u00b1 stat\n0.207 \u00b1 0.018\n0.165 \u00b1 0.010\n0.174 \u00b1 0.025\n0.181 \u00b1 0.017\n0.164 \u00b1 0.016\n0.154 \u00b1 0.024\n0.158 \u00b1 0.018\n0.169 \u00b1 0.014\n\nTable 2: Number of selected (Nhad , Ntag ) and corrected (Nqq , Nbb ) events; average (over\nall | cos \u03b8thr | < 0.9 bins) selection (including b-tagging) efficiencies; the Standard Model\nprediction for Rc and the resulting value of Rb (with statistical uncertainties only) for the\neight energies.

In each | cos \u03b8thr | bin, the efficiencies and corrected numbers of qq\nand bb events are determined. The efficiencies, \u01ebb,c,uds , are defined as the number of MC\nevents of the specific flavour b-tagged in the | cos \u03b8thr | bin, divided by the number of events\nof that specific flavour that were generated in that bin.\nRb is then calculated in each bin in the range | cos \u03b8thr | < 0.9. Figure 2 shows the\nvalue of Rb versus | cos \u03b8thr | for the 189 GeV and 207 GeV samples. The final value of Rb\nis determined by taking the average over all bins. The total numbers of selected hadronic\nand tagged events, the values of the variables in equation 1, as well as the resulting Rb\nvalue with its statistical uncertainty, are summarized in Table 2.\nThe resulting Rb values are quoted for the case where Rc is set to its Standard Model\nvalue, RcSM , given in Table 2.

The variation of parameters is realized by reweighting Monte Carlo events to the\nmodified distribution.\n\u221a\n\u2022 b fragmentation: Although the mean scaled energy 2hEb i/ s of weakly decaying\nb hadrons is expected to change from LEP1 to LEP2 energies, the free parameter\n\u01ebbP of the Peterson fragmentation function [11] used in the default MC for heavy\nflavour events is assumed not to vary with energy. The value in bb events is varied\nin the range 0.0030 <\u221a\u01ebbP < 0.0048, which corresponds to a variation of the mean\nscaled energy\n2hEb i/ s of weakly decaying b hadrons in Z decays in the range of\n\u221a\n2hEb i/ s = 0.702 \u00b1 0.008 [12]. In addition, the heavy-quark fragmentation model\nis changed to that suggested by Collins and Spiller [28] and to that of Kartvelishvili\n[29]. The largest difference in all the above tests is from the Peterson parameter\nvariation and is taken as the systematic uncertainty.\n\n12\n\n\f\u2022 b decay multiplicity: The multiplicity of the charged decay products of hadrons\ncontaining a b quark is varied in the Monte Carlo simulation according to [12].\n\u2022 b hadron composition: The tagging efficiency differs for the various b hadron\nspecies. The fractions of b hadrons and their uncertainties have been taken from [30].\nThe fractions f (B0s ) and f (bbaryon ) are varied independently within ranges of the\nexperimental measurements, and their variation is compensated by the fraction of\nB0 and B\u00b1 mesons.\n\u2022 b hadron lifetimes: The lifetimes of the different b hadrons are varied in the\nMonte Carlo by their uncertainties according to [30].\n\u2022 c fragmentation: Simulated cc events have their Peterson fragmentation paramec\nter \u01ebcP varied in the range of 0.022\n\u221a < \u01ebP < 0.039. This corresponds to a variation of\nthe mean scaled energy 2hEc i/ s of weakly decaying c hadrons in Z decays in the\n\u221a\nrange of 2hEc i/ s = 0.484 \u00b1 0.010 [12].\n\u2022 c decay multiplicity: The average charged particle multiplicities of D+ , D0 and\nD+\ns decays are varied in the Monte Carlo within the ranges of the experimental\nmeasurements [31].\n\n\u2022 c hadron composition: The D0 fraction is written as f (D0 ) = 1\u2212f (D+ )\u2212f (D+\ns )\u2212\nf (cbaryon ). The last three parameters are varied independently by their uncertainties\naccording to [32] to evaluate the uncertainty on the charm efficiency.\n\u2022 c hadron lifetimes: Charmed hadron lifetimes are varied within their experimental\nuncertainties according to [30].\n\u2022 semileptonic decay modelling and branching ratios: The semileptonic branching ratios of bottom- and charm-hadrons are varied within their experimental uncertainties [12]. The uncertainty due to the semileptonic decay model used in the\nsimulation is estimated as in [24].\n\n4.1.2\n\nInclusive K0 and \u039b production rate\n\nThe total production rates of K0 and \u039b in the Monte Carlo are varied by 4% and 7%\nrespectively according to [4]. This variation contributes an uncertainty of 0.18%.\n\n4.1.3\n\nInitial-final state interference\n\nTo asses the uncertainty on the correction for interference, we used the results of a study\nmade in [3] by replacing the Zfitter predictions with those of the KK2f program [7].\nWe assign the difference between the two predictions as a systematic uncertainty.\n\n4.1.4\n\nFour-fermion background\n\nThe uncertainties on the measured W+ W\u2212 and ZZ cross-sections [2] and the uncertainty\non the luminosity are found to have a negligible systematic effect on Rb . The background\n13\n\n\ffrom W- and Z-pairs has the highest probability to be accepted in the tagged sample when\none or both bosons decay into a final state containing a charm- or bottom-quark. The\nsystematic uncertainty on the W- and Z-pair tagging efficiency is estimated by varying\nthe tagging efficiency by 5%. This variation introduces an uncertainty of 0.15%. The\neffect of the detector resolution is also taken into account, as described in Section 4.2.1.\n\n4.1.5\n\nSecondary heavy-quark production\n\nAs discussed in Section 3.3, the difference between the Monte Carlo rate for secondary\nbb production and the highest expected value is taken as an uncertainty. Typically, this\nprocess contributes a relative uncertainty of about 0.1%. The secondary cc production\nrate is taken from [23, 24] and weighted according to [26] as described in Section 3.3. The\nuncertainty on this estimation contributes a relative uncertainty of 0.13%.\n\n4.1.6\n\nMonte Carlo bb production\n\nThe transition Nhad \u2192 Nqq has a small dependence on the Monte Carlo value of Rb . The\ndefault Monte Carlo value of Rb is varied within the measured uncertainty (Table 2). The\neffect on Rb is negligible.\n\n4.2\n4.2.1\n\nDetector effects\nTrack reconstruction\n\nThe detector performance in the Monte Carlo is varied as in [4, 18]. The effect of the\ndetector resolution on the track parameters is estimated by degrading the resolution of\nall tracks in the Monte Carlo simulation. This is done by applying a single multiplicative\nscale factor to the difference between the reconstructed and true track parameters. A 5%\nvariation is applied independently to the r\u03c6 and rz track parameters. These variations\ntogether contribute an uncertainty of 1.8%. In addition, the efficiency for assigning measurement points in the silicon microvertex detector to the tracks is varied by 1% in r\u03c6\nand 3% in rz. Each of these variations contributes an uncertainty of 1.3%. The track\nreconstruction efficiency is varied by 1%. This is done by randomly discarding 1% of the\ntracks, and contributes an uncertainty of 1.8%. The alignment of the silicon microvertex\ndetector is changed in the Monte Carlo as in [4]. This variation gives an uncertainty of\n0.4%. The systematic uncertainties resulting from the individual variations are summed\nin quadrature.\nSince the largest part of this uncertainty is due to the effect on \u01ebuds , we verify the\nvalidity of the 5% variation in the r\u03c6 track parameters by using events that are rejected\nby the b-tagger. We look at the 182\u2013209 GeV sample as well as at data collected in the\nsame years at the Z peak for detector calibration. Events with a low value of Lhemi in\none hemisphere are selected, giving a sample dominated by light-quark pairs. The value\nof the vertex significance in the opposite hemisphere is then examined. Figure 3 shows\n14\n\n\f1.3\na)\n\n1.25\n\ndata/MC\n\nRatio of fractions of events with L/\u03c3L \u2039 cut\n\nRatio of fractions of events with L/\u03c3L \u2039 cut\n\nthe fraction of events with vertex significance less than a negative cut value in the data\nand in the Monte Carlo with 5% variation in the r\u03c6 track parameters, normalised to the\nfraction in Monte Carlo. This study suggests that the difference between the data and\nthe Monte Carlo is smaller than the variation on the Monte Carlo and we conclude that\nthe 5% variation is adequate.\n\n1.2\n\n1.15\n\n5% r\u03c6 smear MC/MC\n1.2\n\n1.15\n\n1.05\n\n1.1\n\n1\n\n0.95\n\n1\n\n0.9\n\n0.95\n\n0.85\n\n0.85\n\nb)\n\n1.05\n\n1.1\n\n0.9\n\nOPAL\n\n0.8\n\n182-209 GeV\n\n-10\n-5\n0\nVertex significance (L/\u03c3L) cut\n\n0.75\n\n91 GeV\n\n-10\n-5\n0\nVertex significance (L/\u03c3L) cut\n\nFigure 3: Ratios of fractions of hemispheres with vertex significance smaller than the cut\nvalue on the abscissa. The data (open squares) and the Monte Carlo with 5% deterioration\nof the tracking parameters resolution in r\u03c6 (solid triangles) are normalised to the default\nMonte Carlo. The uncertainties are a combination of the data and Monte Carlo statistical\nuncertainties. Hemispheres are selected if the opposite hemisphere in the event has a low\nvalue of Lhemi , giving a sample 75% pure in uds events. The 182\u2013209 GeV sample is\nshown in a) and the 91 GeV sample in b).\n\n15\n\n\f4.2.2\n\nLepton ID\n\nThe electron identification efficiency is varied by 15% and the electron fake rate by 30%.\nThese values are 50% larger than those used in [5] following a later comparison of OPAL's\ndata and Monte Carlo. The muon identification efficiency is varied by 2% and the fake\nrate by 14%. This source contributes typically an uncertainty of 0.45% on Rb which is\npredominantly from the variation on the electron identification efficiency.\n\n4.2.3\n\nNon-radiative event selection\n\nWe repeated the analysis using a different method for estimating s\u2032 , described in [33].\nThe resulting Rb was found to be different by less than 0.1%. This comparison is almost\nfree of statistical uncertainties; thus we take this difference as an uncertainty.\n\n4.2.4\n\nMonte Carlo statistics\n\nThe finite size of the Monte Carlo samples contributes between 0.6% and 0.8% uncertainty\nto the systematic error.\n\n4.3\n\nCross-checks\n\nAs a cross-check, the analysis is repeated\u221aon data collected in the same years at the Z peak\nfor detector calibration. A value of Rb ( s = mZ ) = 0.210 \u00b1 0.001(stat.) \u00b1 0.006(syst.) is\nobtained. The systematic uncertainty is determined as for the high-energy data samples.\nThis result is consistent with the LEP1 average value of Rb0 = 0.21643 \u00b1 0.00073 [2].\nAnother cross-check is made by comparing the likelihood of the hemisphere to contain\na b-quark in Monte Carlo and data. This comparison is done for both the 182\u2013209 GeV\ndata and the calibration data at the Z peak. We select hemispheres where the b-tagger\noutput in one hemisphere indicates a high probability for the event to be a bb event, and\nlook at the opposite hemisphere. The samples are 60% and 88% pure in bb events for the\nhigh energy and the Z peak data respectively. We also look at hemispheres in events that\nare rejected by the b-tagger in the opposite hemisphere, giving samples with only 6% bb\nevents. The results of this cross-check for the 182\u2013209 GeV data and for the calibration\ndata at the Z peak are shown in Figure 4. The small excess of data with respect to the\nMonte Carlo for Lhemi > 0.85 in the anti-b-tagged plot of the 182\u2013209 GeV sample (Figure\n4 (b)) is covered by the detector resolution uncertainty. It is consistent with the result\nof the study shown in Figure 3 (a). The difference between the Monte Carlo and the\ndata in the b-tagged 91 GeV plot (Figure 4 (c)) is also covered by the detector resolution\nuncertainty.\n\n16\n\n\f10\n\n3\n\nEvents\n\nEvents\n\nb-tag, 182-209 GeV\n\na)\n\nOPAL data\n\n10 4\n\nanti-b-tag, 182-209 GeV\n\nb)\n\n- MC\n\n2\n\nEvents\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nb-tag, 91 GeV\n\n10\n\n10\n\nc)\n\n4\n\n10\n\n2\n\n0\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nanti-b-tag, 91 GeV\n\n0.8\n1\nLhemi\nd)\n\n10 4\n\n3\n\n0\n\n3\n\n0.8\n1\nLhemi\nEvents\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n1\nLhemi\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n1\nLhemi\n\nFigure 4: b-tagger output from one hemisphere for events selected by the opposite hemisphere.

The results are summarized in Table 4, together with earlier OPAL\nresults from 130-172 GeV [5]. The measurements are shown in Figure 5, where they\n17\n\n\fare compared with the predictions of the Standard Model, calculated using Zfitter.\nGood agreement between the Standard Model and the measurements is observed. A\ncomparison of the eight measurements reported here to the Standard Model prediction\ngives: \u03c72 = 5.0, or 76% probability of obtaining a larger difference than observed. Since\nthe \u03c72 test only uses the absolute difference between the prediction and measurement, we\nalso made another test assuming that the ratio of the measurement to the prediction is\nconstant. We perform a \u03c72 fit for the ratio using only the statistical uncertainties and\nadd the systematic uncertainties, which are assumed to be fully correlated, to the result.\nWe obtain a ratio of 1.055 \u00b1 0.031 (stat.) \u00b1 0.037 (sys.). Both tests suggest that these\nmeasurements are consistent with the Standard Model.\n\nRb\n\nThe measurement technique presented here has a larger selection efficiency and purity\nand thus yields a smaller statistical uncertainty and a smaller dependence on Rc than the\none used previously. The 183 GeV and 189 GeV results are in agreement with [5] and\nsupersede the previous measurements.\n\n0.3\n\nOPAL\n\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n\nThis measurement\nPrevious measurement\n\n0.05\n0\n\n120\n\n130\n\n140\n\n150\n\n160\n\n170\n\n180\n\n190\n\n200 210\n\u221as (GeV)\n\nFigure 5: The measured Rb values (points with error bars) and the Standard Model\nprediction (solid line).\n\n6\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe particularly wish to thank the SL Division for the efficient operation of the LEP accelerator at all energies and for their close cooperation with our experimental group.
