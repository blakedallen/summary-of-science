Conscious experience is filtered not just through innate categories to give rise to stimulusresponse reflexes, but also learned categories, including concepts such as 'container', 'democracy', 'truth'\nand 'falsehood'. The meanings of these concepts are not rigid or static but shift fluidly depending on\ncontext, increasing dramatically our potential to both inform and be informed by the world. As Edelman\nand Tonini (2000, p. 101) put it: \"Every act of perception is, to some extent, an act of creation, and\nevery act of memory is, to some degree, an act of imagination.\"\nElements of conscious experience, such as perceived stimuli, retrieved memories, and concepts are\nconsidered entities of the personal cognitive sphere, referred to collectively as 'conceptual entities'. These\ncan be modelled by considering them as configurations of properties, which are consistently testable\nthrough personal and interpersonal cognitive processes such as perception, reflection, and social interactions. Specifically, we are concerned with the interface between the conceptual entity and its extraneous\nsurroundings: the context. The interrelation and concatenation of concepts consciously experienced as a\nstream of thought is particularly affected by context, being influenced not only by the ever-fluctuating\nassociative structure of the conceptual network but also by drives and emotion, as well as environmental\naffordances including the social milieu.\nOne of the characteristic aspects of quantum mechanics is the measurement context provoking an\nindeterministic influence on the physical entity under consideration. The mathematical formalism of\nquantum mechanics describes precisely this influence and its corresponding probabilities. The situation\nof contextual influence in cognition is more complex than the one encountered in the micro-world, but\ngeneralizations of the mathematical formalisms of quantum mechanics are transferable to the modeling\nof the creative, contextual manner in which concepts are formed, evoked, and often merged together in\ncognition (Gabora 2001, Gabora and Aerts 2002a, Gabora and Aerts 2002b). Of course, the nature of\nthe conceptual entity differs essentially from that of a physical entity in its transience and subjectivity,\nand in its ontological status. The operational formulation of 'generalized' quantum mechanics, however,\nallows a description of contextuality that does not specifically depend on the physical nature of the\nentities and contexts involved (Aerts 1982, Aerts 1983, Aerts 1986, Aerts 1998, Aerts 2002, Aerts and\nAerts 1994, Aerts and Aerts 1997, Aerts et al. 1999a, Aerts et al. 1999b).\nFor clarity, we emphasize that it is the abstracted formalism which is 'borrowed' from quantum theory,\nnot in any way its microphysical ontology of particles and fields. Our approach thus concerns the formal\nstructure of models that are able to describe cognitive entities and processes with contextuality, not the\nsubstrate that implements them in the brain.\n\n1\n\nFormalization of Contextual Change\n\nIn this section we explain why the mathematical modeling of a certain kind of contextuality requires\nabstracted 'quantum' structures. Let us consider an entity-a conceptual entity in our case-and a\n\u2217 Published as: Aerts, D., Broekaert, J. and Gabora, L. (2003), A case for applying an abstracted quantum formalism to\ncognition, in Mind in Interaction, ed. Campbell, R., John Benjamins, Amsterdam.\n\n1\n\n\fcontext- e.g. some situation or social framework. The entity, denoted S, can be in different states. We\nrepresent the set of relevant states of S as the set \u03a3, and denote individual states by symbols p, q, r, . . . \u2208 \u03a3.\nThe effect of the context, which we denote by e, on the entity S is, in its most general form, that it changes\nthe state p of the entity to another state q of the entity. In general this change of state under influence of\nthe context is not deterministic, which means that a probability of change is involved. Let us denote by\n\u03bc(q, p, e) the probability that the context e changes state p of S to state q. Of course, for a modelling of\nthe complete situation, not one but several different possible contexts must be considered. Let is denote\nthe set of all relevant contexts M, and specific contexts by the symbols e, f, g, . . . \u2208 M. This means\nthat the abstract form of the mathematical formalism we consider is determined by the triplet (\u03a3, M, \u03bc),\nwhere \u03a3 is the set of states of the entity S, M is the set of contexts for S, and \u03bc : \u03a3 \u00d7 \u03a3 \u00d7 M \u2192 [0, 1],\nthe probability function that describes the transition probability between different states of S under the\ninfluence of a specific context.\n\n1.1\n\nClassical and Quantum Contextuality\n\nThe abstracted formalism gives us qualitative indications and quantitative measures of contextuality, tools\nwith which we can evaluate and describe contextuality in various cognitive processes. As in quantum\nmechanics, there are two kinds of contextuality in cognition. In order to elaborate them, however, it is\nnecessary to present a few more details-albeit a strict minimum-of the generalized quantum formalism.\nWithin the standard quantum mechanical formalism, two kinds of change under the influence of\ncontext are distinguished. First there is a nondeterministic change of state under influence of the measurement context. For this change, each state pu of the quantum entity S under consideration is described\nby a unit vector u of a complex Hilbert space H. Let us denote this set of states by \u03a3H . Each (measurement) context eH is described by a self-adjoint operator H on this Hilbert space H. Let us denote the\nset of contexts by MH . The probability function \u03bc is given as follows. Suppose the quantum entity is in\nstate pu under the influence of context eH . The state pu is then changed to one of the eigenstates pv of\nthe self-adjoint operator H, and the probability of change is given by:\n\u03bc(pv , pu , eH ) = |hu, vi|2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere hu, vi is the scalar product of vectors u and v in the Hilbert space H.\nSecond there is a deterministic change, which is the 'mechanic' evolution. It is described by the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation, governing continuous change over time. For clarity, we mention that, within a\nclassical mechanical formalism, only deterministic change under the influence of context is possible, and\nit is described by the equations of Newton.\nTo a first approximation we can say that the term classical contextuality refers only to situations\nwhere context works in a deterministic way on the state of the entity under consideration, while quantum\ncontextuality includes nondeterministic change for measurement contexts and deterministic change for\ndynamical contexts.\n\n1.2\n\nThe Statistical Situation\n\nOf course in classical physics, models are built that include indeterminism, namely statistical mechanical\nmodels. This indeterminism, however, is of a specific and limited nature: it describes a lack of knowledge\nabout the exact (pure) state of the physical entity under consideration. Thus, the notion of statistical\nstate (or mixed state) is introduced. In our formalism it is similarly possible to describe entities (even\nconceptual entities) in statistical states. In this statistical case, the distinction between classical and\nquantum is subtle and depends on the structure of the probability model involved. If the probability\nmodel is Kolmogorovian-meaning that it satisfies Kolmogorov's axioms, and hence the event space is a\n\u03c3-algebra-only the classical statistical situation can be described.\nIt is known that the quantum probability model is not Kolmogorovian (Accardi 1982, Accardi and\nFedullo 1982, Pitowsky 1989). It is possible to prove that the nonKolmogorovian nature of the quantum\nprobability model is due to a lack of knowledge concerning how context interacts with the entity under\nconsideration, i.e. by the presence of fluctuations in the interaction between context and entity. Even if\nwe were to suppose that at the ontological level the interaction between context and entity engenders a\nchange of state that is deterministic, a lack of knowledge about this interaction gives rise to a probability\n\n2\n\n\fmodel that does not satisfy Kolmogorov's axioms. Hence a quantum-like probability model is needed to\nmodel this situation (Aerts 1986, Aerts 1987, Aerts 1995).\nBecause of the confusion often created by this subtility, we will elaborate it a little further. If a\nmodel contains only one state of an entity and one context influencing this state, as is often the case\nin an isolated problem where no attempt is made to deliver a full model description of the entity, the\ndistinction between classical and quantum described above vanishes. Consider the situation of 'casting\na die'. In probability theory, only one state and one context are given. Indeed, suppose we do not know\nexactly how the die is cast-as is the case in the standard probability model of this situation-then this\nlack of knowledge gives rise to one state, a statistical state that describes the situation \"the die is cast\",\nwithout any further specification of how it is cast. There is just one context, for example the physical\nstate of the table on which the die is cast. But we can inverse the description, and for example consider\nthe state \"the die is located within a cup that stands on the table\", which is a 'pure' state as compared\nto the former statistical state that we considered. Then the context becomes more intricate: \"we, who\ntake the cup, move it around, and cast the die on the table, plus the situation of the table\". Here the\nlack of knowledge concerns the context, not the state of the die. Obviously both situations give rise to\nthe same mathematical model, and Kolmogorovian probability theory can be applied.\nThe die example shows that for a very simple situation that can be modeled using only one state\nand one context, the mathematical structure of the probability model cannot give us the information\nneeded to distinguish between the two ontologically different situations: lack of knowledge about the\nstate, and lack of knowledge about the context. Moreover, the situation can always be captured within a\nKolmogorovian probability model. We note this explicitly because in cognition as well as in other fields\nwhere probability theory is used, the more complex situation is often cut down to a sample of fragmented\nsimple situations, where only one state and one context are considered. Then each simple situation\ncan be modeled by standard probability theory within a Kolmogorovian structure. It is only when the\nmore complex situation of an entity changing and evolving over a range of different states is considered\nthat the ontological difference between lack of knowledge of the state giving rise to a Kolmogorovian\nstructure, and lack of knowledge of the context giving rise to a quantum structure, is revealed. This\nphenomenon is well known in axiomatics. Indeed, the Kolmogorovian structure of a probability model\nis an axiomatic structure, and often ontological differences are only revealed by means of the axiomatic\nstructure if the situations considered are not too simple (not too small). Often in cognition and other\nfields of science, a complex situation is cut into fragmented simple situations without paying attention\nafterwards to how these fragmented situations are pasted back again into a complex model that still\ncorresponds to reality. We believe that this at the origin of the fact that the quantum nature-or at\nleast nonKolmogorovian nature-of such complex situations was not identified much earlier. It has been\nproven that in the case of an entity with simple dual contexts (contexts that allow only two possible\neffects of change), at least three contexts are needed for the resulting quantum structure to be revealed\nmathematically (Accardi 1982, Accardi and Fedullo 1982).\n\n2\n\nContextuality in Cognition\n\nIn cognition, we will always lack knowledge concerning the interaction between the context and the\nconceptual entity. Hence the situation of the presence of uncontrollable fluctuations on this interaction\nis the standard one that we have to consider. This is the strongest argument we put forward for the\nnecessity of applying the mathematical structures developed for generalized quantum mechanics to the\ncognition. Again we remark that the quantum structure of the mathematical model will only be revealed\nif more than one state and one context are considered. A detailed analysis of this situation, taken into\naccount the effect of the presence of fluctuations on the interaction between context and entity, giving rise\nto a generalized quantum structure and nonKolmogorovian probability model, can be found in Gabora\n(2001), and Gabora and Aerts (2002b). Prior to this general approach, specific abstracted quantum\nmodels had been worked out for various cognitive situations by our group. Indeed, it was already obvious\nto us that quantum structures had to account for the phenomenon of contextualization.\nAt present, we are far from a generally applicable quantum-like approach to describing what happens\nin the mind. However, the effectiveness of applying appropriate adaptations of the quantum formalism\nto specific problems in the field is considerable. In the next few sections, we illustrate how some of\nperplexing problems in the formal description of human conscious experience can be handled in this way.\nIn each case, we explain how non-classical features arise with respect to the relevant cognitive entities\n3\n\n\fand processes and how their contextual aspects are described through the introduction of quantum-like\nformalisms.\n\n2.1\n\nViolation of Bell Inequalities by Entangled Concepts\n\nThe presence of entanglement-i.e.genuine quantum structure-can be tested for by determining whether\ncorrelation experiments on a joint entity violate Bell inequalities (Bell 1964). Pitowsky (1989) proved\nthat if Bell inequalities are satisfied in an experiment, it follows a classical Kolmogorovian probability\nscheme. The probability can then be explained as being due to a lack of knowledge about the precise\nstate of the system in a classical manner. If, however, Bell inequalities are violated, Pitowsky proved\nthat no such classical Kolmogorovian probability model exists. In that case the interwoven nature of the\ncompound entity is exposed.\nBell inequalities have been successfully applied to an elementary cognitive setting (Aerts et al. 2000),\nwith the inequalities functioning as a quantitative indicator of entanglement. The application in cognition\nrequires a brief presentation of basic elements of the formalism. We need to introduce four experiments ei\neach having only two possible outcomes, with i running from 1 to 4. Furthermore, we need the expectation\nvalues Eij , with i, j each running from 1 to 4, for coincidence experiments, i.e.joint experiments of the\ntype ei ej . The expectation values are defined as:\nEij = P (oi (u), oj (u)) + P (oi (d), oj (d)) \u2212 P (oi (u), oj (d)) \u2212 P (oi (d), oj (u))\n\n(2)\n\nwhere originally u stands for 'up' and d for 'down', but actually they can stand for any outcomes out of\nthe two possibilities. So 'yes' and 'no' are valid as well. We assume that the associated outcome values\no are either +1 (for o(u)) or -1 (for o(d)) , the correlation outcome function P are then +1 or -1 as well.\nFinally, from the assumption that the correlation Eij is local, Bell derived his inequalities:\n|E13 \u2212 E14 | + |E23 + E24 | \u2264 2\n\n(3)\n\nThe essential point here is that when this inequality holds it indicates that the entity is not entangled;\nthat is, the aspects of the entity exposed by the different experiments are not interdependent.\nWe illustrate its cognitive application as follows. Let there be a person-the respondent in our\nexperiment-who is very acquainted with two cats Glimmer and Inkling which sometimes sport tinkling\nbells on their necklaces. Suppose now that we submit our respondent to some basic experiments, which\nare nothing more than asking for a reply to one of the questions,\nD : \"Think of one of the cats, which one?\" (Directive question)\nS : \"Do you hear its bell ring?\" (Sensory question)\nwhile at the same time one of the cats-which first were out of sight-can jump on the scene. In the\ncoincidence experiments we consider combinations of the basic ones just mentioned, with of course the\npossibility here that both cats appear in front of the respondent.\nWe can summarize the basic experiments and outcomes as follows:\n\ne1\ne2\ne3\ne4\n\nExperiments\nD + \"Glimmer appears\"\nS + \"Inkling appears\"\nD + \"Inkling appears\"\nS + \"Glimmer appears\"\n\nOutcome up\n\"Glimmer!\"\n\"ring\"\n\"Inkling!\"\n\"ring\"\n\nOutcome down\n\"Inkling!\"\n\"silence\"\n\"Glimmer!\"\n\"silence\"\n\nThe necessary conditions such that Bell inequalities are violated in this experiment are as follows. As a\nfact we must have i) both cats are wearing bells around their necks that day. We require the respondent\nii) to abide the question experiments, iii) to have an activated categorical concept 'cat'. Most crucially\nis however the feature of yielding to the coercive nature of internalized context iv) when Glimmer is seen,\nthere is a change of mind state and the instance 'Glimmer' is reported, and when Inkling is seen 'Inkling'\nis reported. Then the outcome table for joint experiments in this configuration can be immediately\nobtained:\n\n4\n\n\fExperiments\nD + \"Glimmer&Inkling\"\nD + S + \"Glimmer\"\nD + S + \"Inkling\"\nS + \"Glimmer&Inkling\"\n\ne13\ne14\ne23\ne24\n\noi (u)oj (d)\n\"Glimmer!\"\n-\n\noi (d)oj (u)\n\"Inkling!\"\n-\n\noi (u)oj (u)\n\"Glimmer!+ring\"\n\"Inkling!+ring\"\n\"rings\"\n\noi (d)oj (d)\n-\n\nThis leads the to the correlation values: E13 = \u22121. E14 = +1, E23 = +1, E24 = +1. As a consequence\nwe have the violation of the Bell inequality:\n|E13 \u2212 E14 | + |E23 + E24 | = +4\n\n(4)\n\nThe reason that Bell inequalities are violated is that the respondent's state of mind changes from activation of the abstract categorical concept 'cat', to activation of either 'Glimmer' or 'Inkling'. We can thus\nview the state 'cat' as an entangled state of these two instances of it. The relationship between a concept\nand specific instances of it with a coercive context lead to the violation of the Bell inequality (Aerts et\nal. 2000). Thus we have evidence that this formalism reflects the underlying structure of concepts. In\nAerts et al. (2000) we show that this result is obtained because of the presence of EPR-type correlations\namongst the features or properties of concepts. The EPR nature of these correlations arises because of\nhow concepts exist in states of potentiality, with the presence or absence of particular properties being\ndetermined in the process of the evoking or actualizing of the concept. In such situations, the mind\nhandles concept combination in a quantum manner.\n\n2.2\n\nThe Opinion Poll\n\nWe extend the foregoing analysis of entangled states of concepts to a cognitive setting where an individuals\nopinions are probed. Opinions may appear to be more stable than other sorts of conceptual entities that\nmanifest as fleeting contents of conscious experience, such as impressions and ideas. However, even\nopinions can exhibit quantum-like contextuality. The formalism employed here for the identification and\ndescription of nonclassical contextuality in cognition can be applied experimentally, for instance, to the\nanalysis of opinion poles (Aerts and Aerts 1994, Aerts and Aerts 1997). To explain this we first have to\nintroduce the sphere-elastic model, which is a quantum model for the spin of a spin 1/2 quantum entity\n(Aerts 1986, Aerts 1987, Aerts 1993, Aerts 1995).\nThe states of the sphere-elastic model correspond to the points P of the surface of a sphere, denoted\nsurf , with center O and radius 1. This means that we can denote a state pv by indicating the unitvector v corresponding to a point of surf (see Fig. 1,a), and the collection of all possible states is\n\u03a3 = {pv | v \u2208 surf }. For each point u \u2208 surf , we introduce the context eu in the following way. We\nconsider the diametrically opposite point \u2212u, and install an elastic band of length 2, such that it is fixed\nwith one of its end-points in u and the other end-point in \u2212u. The influence of the context eu is the\nfollowing. Once the elastic is installed, the particle P falls from its original place v orthogonally onto the\nelastic, and sticks to it (Fig. 1,b). The elastic then breaks and the particle P , attached to one of the two\npieces of the elastic (Fig. 1,c), moves to one of the two end-points u or \u2212u (Fig. 1,d).\nv P\n\nu\n\nv\n\nu\n\n\u03b8\n\nP \u03b8\n-u\n\n(a)\n\n-u\n(b)\n\nu\n\nu\nP\n\nFig. 1 : A representation the sphere model. In (a) P\nindicates a state pv in the point v, and the elastic corresponding to the context eu is installed between the two\ndiametrically opposed points u and \u2212u. In (b) P falls\northogonally onto the elastic and sticks to it. In (c) the\nelastic breaks and P is pulled towards the point u, such\nthat (d) it arrives at the point u.\n\nP\n-u\n(c)\n\n-u\n(d)\n\n5\n\n\fThe state pv is changed by the context eu into one of the two states pu or p\u2212u . We make the hypothesis\nthat the elastic band breaks uniformly, which means that the probabilities of state transition under\ninfluence of the contexts are:\n\u03b8\n1 + cos\u03b8\n= cos2\n2\n2\n1 \u2212 cos\u03b8\n2\u03b8\n= sin\n2\n2\n\n\u03bc(pu , pv , eu ) =\n\u03bc(p\u2212u , pv , eu ) =\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nWe can easily show that the sphere-elastic model is an entity of which the description is isomorphic to\nthe quantum description of the spin of a spin 1/2 particle. Hence, speaking in the quantum jargon, the\nsphere-elastic model is a model for the spin of a spin 1/2 quantum particle. This means that we can\ndescribe it using the ordinary quantum formalism with a two-dimensional complex Hilbert space as the\ncarrier for the set of states of the entity. It is easy to see on the sphere-elastic model the effect of the lack\nof knowledge on the contexts: this corresponds to the lack of knowledge of where the elastic will break\nduring the interaction of the context with the state of the entity.\nWhile in quantum mechanics the effect of context on the outcome is complete, or coercive, in cognition\nit is intermediate, or tempered. The tempered quantum-like contextuality can be described using the\n\u01eb-model (Aerts et al. 1993, Aerts and Durt 1994a, Aerts and Durt 1994b, Aerts e al. 1999d), which is\nan obvious generalization of the sphere elastic model. For the \u01eb-model we introduce for each context\neu a parameter \u01eb \u2208 [0, 1], and make the hypothesis that the elastic corresponding to the context eu can\nnow only break in an interval of length 2\u01eb around the middle point of the elastic. This means that for\n\u01eb = 1, the \u01eb-model reduces to the original sphere-elastic model, hence a pure quantum model, while for\n\u01eb = 0, each elastic can only break in its middle point, which means that we have a classical situation, of\ncontexts that have a deterministic effect on the state of the entity under consideration (with exception\nof what happens in the middle point, but this is a classical type of indeterminism, as in the case of a\nclassical unstable equilibrium position). For intermediate values of \u01eb, smaller than 1 and greater than 0,\nthe \u01eb-model describes the tempered situation of quantum-like contextuality.\nLet us describe shortly how the \u01eb-model can be used to model the quantum-like contextuality that\nappears in a opinion poll situation. We consider three different questions for the opinion poll.\nu1 : \"Are you in favor of the use of nuclear energy?\"\nu2 : \"Do you think it would be a good idea to legalize soft-drugs?\"\nu3 : \"Do you think capitalism is better than social-democracy?\"\nWe have chosen typical questions on which many respondents will not have predetermined opinions. Since\nthe respondent has to respond with 'yes' or 'no', she or he, not having an opinion before the questioning\nwill 'form' an opinion during the process of questioning itself. The \u01eb- model can be applied to fingerprint\nthis effect of creation in the opinion+context interaction.\n\nu1\nfraction of people with\npredetermined answer 'yes'\nfraction of people without\npredetermined answer\nfraction of people with\npredetermined answer 'no'\n\nFig. 2: representation of the\nquestion u1 by means of the\n\u01eb-model. We have indicated\nthe three regions corresponding to predetermined answer\n'yes', without predetermined\nanswer, and predetermined answer 'no'.\n\n-u1\nTo simplify the situation, but without touching the essence, we make the following assumptions about\nthe probabilities that are involved. We suppose that in all cases 50% of the persons have answered the\nquestion u1 with 'yes', but only 15% of the persons had a predetermined opinion. This means that 70%\nof the persons formed their answer during the process of questioning. For simplicity we make the same\nassumptions for u2 and u3 . We can represent this situation in the \u01eb-model as shown in Figure 2. We\nalso make some assumptions of the way in which the different opinions related to the three questions\ninfluence each other. One can see how a person can be a strong proponent for the use of nuclear energy,\n6\n\n\fwhile having no predetermined opinion about the legalization of soft drugs (area 1 in Figure 3). Area (4)\ncorresponds to a sample of persons that have predetermined opinion in favor of legalization of soft drugs\nand in favor of capitalism. For area (10) we have persons that have predetermined opinion against the\nlegalization of soft drugs and against capitalism. All the 13 areas of Figure 3 can be described in such a\nsimple way.\nu1\n12\n\n1\n\n2\n\n-u3\n3\n\n11\n\nu2\n\n13\n4\n\n10\n\n9\n\n5\n\n-u2\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\nu3\n\nFig. 3: representation of the three questions u1 , u2 , and u3 by means of\nthe \u01eb-model. We have numbered the 13 different regions. For example:\n(1) corresponds to a sample of persons that have predetermined opinion in\nfavor of nuclear energy, but have no predetermined opinion for both other\nquestions, (4) corresponds to a sample of persons that have predetermined\nopinion in favor of legalization of soft drugs and in favor of capitalism,\n(10) corresponds to a sample of persons that have predetermined opinion\nagainst the legalization of soft drugs and against capitalism, (13) corresponds to the sample of persons that have no predetermined opinion about\nnon of the three questions, etc...\n\n-u1\n\nDeliberately we have chosen the different fractions\nof people in such a way that the conditional proba\u221a\nbilities fit into the \u01eb-model for a value of \u01eb = 22 . It can be proven mathematically that these values of\nconditional probabilities corresponding to these questions u1 , u2 and u3 can neither be fitted into a Kolmogorovian probability model nor into a pure quantum probability model (Aerts and Aerts 1994, Aerts\nand Aerts 1997, Aerts 1995). This indicates that only part of the properties are created during the\nprocess of testing, and that the contextual influence is therefore not fully coercive. If the respondents\nalready had a fixed opinion about the question asked, the relevant probability model is Kolmogorovian\nand contextual influence is nihil.\nThis purely technical development of 'interactive' statics does imply, with the prerequisite of feasibility\nof standardized experimental set up as described here, the classical analysis of the opinion pole could be\nmodified in order to identify opinion-context created effects.\n\n2.3\n\nThe Generalized Liar Paradox\n\nThe abstracted quantum formalism is applied next to the modeling of a compound conceptual entity: in\ncasu the generalized Liar Paradox. When one reasons logically over a Liar Paradox - e.g. \"this sentence\nis false\"-, with an initial conceptualization of it as 'true', then one experiences a build-up of cognitive\ndissonance as one recognizes by inference the inconsistency, which is followed by its conceptualization as\n'false'. After which the logical oscillatory process can be reiterated incessantly. We treat the conceptual\nentity of the Liar Paradox as a consistently testable configuration of truth properties expressed by sentences, and subject to our capacity of logical inference, which figures here as a coercive internal context.\nThese conceptual entities have the advantage of simplicity through their autonomy relative to extraneous\ninput other than the personal dispositions of logical inference, e.g. contingent mind frame, emotional\nstate, environment. And still the reflection on these entities is non-trivial with respect to the dynamics\nof self-reference.\nThe complete quantum formal description of the logical properties of the Liar Paradox conceptual\nentity contrasts with the description of the more generally encountered non-classical contextuality in the\nprevious subsections. Next to the non-deterministic contextual collapse evolution, this model of the Liar\nParadox allows the introduction of the continuous deterministic evolution by reasoning at any subsequent\ninstance of time as well. We detail the coincidence of the effect of 'inner' logical context and reasoning\nin our concluding remarks.\nNot only the simpler forms of the double Liar Paradox (Aerts et al. 1999a, Aerts et al. 1999b) but also\nm-sentence generalizations (Aerts et al. 2002a) allow a 'complete' quantum description. These particular\nentities-the generalized m-sentence Liar Paradoxes-are e.g. with m = 5:\n1 sentence 3 is false\n2 sentence 5 is false\n3 sentence 2 is true\n7\n\n(7)\n\n\f4\n\nsentence 1 is true\n\n5 sentence 4 is false\nThe first number is the sentence pointer, then follows the corresponding proposition. The sentence-pointer\nnumbers onto proposition-content numbers, and vice versa, link together the sentences in a closed 'daisy\nchain' configuration.\nIn the present context we merely expose the basic components of the formal model, while deleting most\nof the technical details (Aerts et al. 2002a). The model represents the state of the Liar Paradox entity by\ntensor products of state vectors of the sentence sub-spaces. Initially when the conceptual entity is in its\npotential state no truth value of the entity should be explicited. The truth and falsehood measurements\non each sentence correspond to appropriately chosen projectors, while each next step of the dynamics is\nachieved by endorsing the inferred truth value resulting in the ensuing projection.\nWe have shown the model needs to be constructed in a (2m)m dimensional Hilbert space. However,\nthe evolution of the given paradox constrains the dynamics to a mere 2m-dimensional subspace. Given\nthe choice of the truth and falsehood by hypothesis operators, for sentence i:\nTi\n\n= 11 \u2297 ...1i\u22121 \u2297 T \u2297 1i+1 ... \u2297 1m\n\nFi\n\n= 11 \u2297 ...1i\u22121 \u2297 F \u2297 1i+1 ... \u2297 1m\n\n0\n...\n1\n0\n\n0\n...\n0\n0\n\n(8)\n\nwith\nT =\n\n0\n...\n0\n0\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n!\n\nand F =\n\n2m\u00d72m\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n0\n...\n0\n0\n\n0\n...\n0\n0\n\n0\n...\n0\n1\n\n!\n\n(9)\n2m\u00d72m\n\nand given a particular m-sentence configuration, the corresponding reasoning sequence of 2m vectors\ncan be constructed. All residual entries of the state vector are unequivocally fixed by a 'filling' procedure. With respect to this procedure, we obtained consistently interpretable state functions in terms of\n\"truth/falsehood by reference\" and \"truth/falsehood by hypothesis\".\nThe first step of the reasoning on the Liar Paradox is represented by letting a projector (9), corresponding to the chosen logical hypothesis, act on the initial superposition state \u03a80 , an equiponderate\nexpression of all possible truth and falsehood states of component sentences. All subsequent steps of\ninferences-hypothesis when reasoning through the generalized Liar Paradox are discrete in their effect\nand can therefore be conceived as the operation of a step matrix. In the 5-Liar Paradox example (7),\nthis discrete evolution submatrix is given by;\n\uf8eb 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \uf8f6\nUD |sub\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n= \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(10)\n\nThe discreteness in the temporal process features explicitly in the logical reasoning. In the present\nmodel, the formalism of quantum mechanics on the other hand allows a continuous time parameter of\nevolution, allowing 'intermediate' states of reasoning on the Liar Paradox. This is done by extracting the\nphenomenological Hamiltonian-the infinitesimal time propagator of the system-through the application\nof Stone's Theorem (see Figure 4).\nIn the full quantum model an initial hypothesis about one sentence engenders a time evolution of build\nup and collapse of logical states without end. Evidently any real world reasoning on the Liar paradox\ndoes not expose this compulsory machine-like continuation of the process.\nThen what does the complete quantum description reflect? The autonomy of dynamics does not\nnecessarily intend an ontological reality of the isolated conceptual entity. The latter could be inferred from\ntoo literal interpretation of the physical analogy with the obtained complete quantum description. On\nthe other hand, the construction procedure of the step evolution reflects the cognitive person's motivation\nby reasoning. The obtained dynamical model extends the 'entity + context' configuration which is static.\nWe have therefore been able in this case to introduce a time-propagator characterizing the concatenation of states of thought, albeit restricted to a non-evolving coercive logical context of logical inference.\n8\n\n\fIt is to be expected that more general conceptual entity with variable internal context and environmental\ncontext will not fit a complete quantum model, a fortiori one with a permanent propagator. We can\ninterpret the descriptive coincidence of the 'autonomous evolution of an ontological state' and 'coercion\nby inner logical context' as the mechanism that lends the conceptual entity its intentionality. The conceptual entity 'liar paradox' refers over time and consistently to the inner context of logical inference,\nwhich is indeed, in this particular case, sufficient ground for recognizing its intentionality.\n\n5.F\n5.T\n4.F\n4.T\n3.F\n3.T\n2.F\n2.T\n1.F\n1.T\n\n1\nP 0.5\n0\n\nFig. 4: Time evolution of outcome probabilities for\nreasoning the 5-Liar Paradox (7), with at t = 0, a\n'true'-measurement of sentence 1 on the initial state\n\u03a80 . The 'time' t is an arbitrary continuous ordering parameter without physical interpretation. Logical\ncontradiction is apparent after each interval \u2206t = 5 \u03c02 .\nThe probability for a given outcome \"sentence i is\nT /F at time t\" is obtained by taking the modulus\nsquared of the scalar product of sentence of substate\n\"i is T /F \" and the initial state evolved till time t, i.e:\n2\nP (i.T /F , 1.T, t) = \u03c8i.T /F |U (t)P1.T \u03a80 .\n\n0\n5\nFinally, does the quantum\nmodel 'solve' the liar paradox? The feature of the non-classical contextuality\n10\nreflects a distinct ontological status of the 15\nLiar Paradox as a highly contextual entity when compared\nto conceptual entities with fixed classical truth or falsehood. The model therefore suggests that entities\nexist which are not subject to classical logical categories. When we try to understand the paradox\nthrough these classical categories, we are caught in a contradiction which, in this model, can be avoided\nby separation of incompatible values over time.\n\n2.4\n\nThought as a Cognitive Form of Context-driven Actualization of Potential\n\nAs we mentioned in section 1.1, in quantum mechanics there are two fundamental forms of change: (1)\ncontinuous dynamical evolution in the absence of a measurement as described by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation,\nand (2) quantum collapse when a measurement takes place. We propose that conscious experience\nsimilarly consists of two phases: (1) a continuous, predictable unfolding of states when the situation does\nnot require a decision to be made and presents no outstanding ambiguity, and (2) context-driven collapse\nof the conceptual network when a decision must be made, or an ambiguous stimulus or situation resolved\n(Gabora 2001). In this second situation, we say that prior to the decision or resolution of ambiguity,\nthe mind is in a state of potentiality. This is demonstrated schematically in Figure 5, which shows the\npotentiality state of the concept 'diamond' and the various different contexts that actualize to differing\ndegrees the various different properties of 'diamond'. Thus, for example, in the context of wanting to cut\nmetal, the property 'strength' would be actualized, whereas in the context of wanting to marry someone,\nthe property of being a symbol of love would be actualized. In the context of wanting to make money, the\nproperty 'valuable' is actualized. This context might pull in properties that are not generally associated\nwith diamond, such as that a fake diamond can be constructed from plastic.\ncontext:\nwant to make money\ncontext:\ncut metal\nstrong\n\nvaluable\nsymbol\nof love\n\nFigure 5. The potentiality state associated with the\nconcept 'diamond' showing some of the many features that could potentially be present in various different context-driven actualizations of this concept.\n.\n\nsparkly\nFAKE IT\ncontext:\nexpress love\nconcept of diamond\n\n9\n\n\fWe can view situations as 'testing' or measuring the state of the conceptual network, revealing something\nof its hidden structure by showing how it collapses in response to a certain kind of context.\ncontext:\nwant to make money\ncontext:\ncut metal\nstrong\n\nvaluable\nsymbol\nof love\n\nFigure 6. The collapsed state of the concept 'diamond' in the context of wanting to make money.\nSome of the features that were previously potential\nare no longer potential, whereas others are now actualized.\n\nsparkly\nFAKE IT\ncontext:\nexpress love\nconcept of diamond\n\nThe collapse is demonstrated schematically in Figure 6. In this case, the context is that of wanting to\nmake money. This context causes the concept 'diamond' to collapse from a superposition type state\nwhere many elements are potentially relevant to an 'eigenstate' (end state) where specific elements are\nactually relevant.\nMore broadly, both the continuous and discontinuous aspects of both conscious experience and quantum mechanics can be viewed as different means of instantiating Context Driven Actualization of Potential\nor CAP (Gabora 2001). Both of the continuous forms of change can be seen as the degenerate case of the\ndiscontinuous; with respect to the present context there is only one possible outcome, thus the outcome\nis determined. Since the potentiality is limited to one outcome there is no need for collapse; this one\nalternative just plays itself out.\nIt is interesting to note that two of the greatest stumbling blocks we now face in the formalization of\nconscious processes are extremely similar to the two main problems that have been identified in quantum\nmechanics. These problems can be referred to as the measurement problem and the entanglement problem.\n\u2022 The measurement problem: Classical mechanics cannot describe situations where the measurement\naffects the state of an entity. For quantum mechanics the effect of change provoked by the measurement context on the state of the quantum entity is an essential ingredient of the theory. Similarly,\nwhen a concept (e.g. 'diamond') is evoked, it is evoked in some context, which affects its state.\nTherefore we need a formalism that incorporates context into description of entity.\n\u2022 The entanglement problem: If in classical mechanics the composed entity consisting of two entities\nis described, this composed entity does not contain'new' states, that cannot be reduced to product\nstates. In quantum mechanics this is essentially the case, the composed entity consisting of two\nquantum entities, always contains 'new' states, the so called entangled states. Similarly, in creative\nprocess, concepts merge to generate something new with properties not reducible to the given\nconstituents. Again, we need a formalism for describing how two entities combine into one and how\nnew states are formed during this combination.\nThe similarity of the problems faced in the two domains should make it clear that the application of\nformalisms from one to the other was not pulled out of a hat. In fact, it is part of an effort to gather\ndifferent forms of change-physical, chemical, geological, biological, cognitive, cultural, social, economic,\nand so forth-under one umbrella that identifies and formalizes their similarities and differences with\nrespect to: (1) Degree of contextuality, (2) Degree of indeterminism due to context, (3) Degree of context\ndependence, and (4) Degree to which context-driven change is retained in future lineage(s). For present\npurposes it would not be appropriate to go into this general framework in detail. Our point is merely\nto show that the application of quantum formalisms to cognition is part of an interdisciplinary effort to\ndevelop a general framework for comparing and contrasting processes of change.\n\n10\n\n\f3\n\nThe Ontology of Cognition and Consciousness\n\nWe now outline the relationship of the developments of abstracted quantum formalism in cognition\ndescribed here to the general question of the ontology of cognition and consciousness. This approach\nprovides possibly a sufficient framework for a process of consciousness in systems with the capacity of\nconceptualization. We will juxtapose this with an amplification process model of consciousness (Gabora\n2002), which is also consistent with the presented intrinsic contextuality formalism, but extends it with\nthe additional assumption the consciousness is a fundamental primitive.\n\n3.1\n\nThe 'Reflected' Internal Context Model of Consciousness\n\nThe abstracted quantum formalism we apply to cognition sustains a view of consciousness as an emergent,\nintegrated process involving reflection of the entity via the context. We now reiterate the underlying\narguments for and expand upon this view.\nFirst we mention that the presence of quantum-like probability structure is not a sufficient indication\nfor emergent processes in the conceptual entity-context interaction, i.e. with genuine new states resulting.\nThe quantitative tool of statistics discerns classical and quantum-like probability structure, given the\nconstraints of multiple states and multiple contexts, and does so depending on contextual uncertainty\nor interaction uncertainty. This leaves open a number of ontologically very different decisive factors\nfor the quantum-like probability structure: 'fuzzy' context, fluctuating interaction, and indeed entityintegration. An interaction process giving rise to a nonKolmogorovian probability structure can still\nhave an underlying deterministic mechanics. Potentially this type of dynamics provides emergence but\nfails to procure the new state properties in terms of the created entity, and shunts the typical features of\nthe quantum approach in which it is embedded (cf below). On the other hand an emergent integration\nprocess of conceptual entity+context will provide the necessary supplementary variability-it has new\nfeatures-in the interaction to certainly break the Kolmogorovian axioms, and thus lead to the quantumlike probability structures. But this effect is not unequivocally expressed since the quantum-like structure\ncould already have been accounted for by mere contextual uncertainty. So we find in quantum-like\nprobability structure no decisive indication of emergence.\nMore potent arguments come from the various examples of quantum-like features in cognitive processes using different quantum approaches (Bell, Schr\u00f6dinger, \u01eb-model, CAP evolution); these do strongly\nsuggest an emergent process. In quantum physics the non-deterministic change , i.e. the measurement\ncollapse, has an extra-ordinary function: it relates the single individual entity to the coercive superstructure of the measuring context. The measurement collapse thus integrates hybrid components, formally\nit subjects the individual entities state function to the projection operator of the context. Physically\nalthough we understand that a connection between both is possible; the superstructure of the context is\nin fact a highly structured and organized compound system of elementary entities. The architecture and\norganization of the superstructure supplies it with supplementary functionality, the acquired 'new' properties. These emergent features can be understood in the manner of complex dynamics (a process widely\naccounted for in the literature, e.g. Scott (1995)). The von Neumann measurement collapse is therefore\na generic procedure and formalism for the interaction of an entity and its relative superstructure. In\ncognition exactly the same relation is present between the conceptual entity and the cognitive context.\nThe effective context in the cognitive scheme refers to a vast network of related concepts, memories,\ndrives, stimuli and supplemented by the induced effects of the external environment, which constitute\nfinally the present mind frame. The cognitive context shows to some extent the same hybrid relation\nwith conceptual entities and has to some extent the same hybrid coercive effect. Only on these grounds\nwe can identify the quantum-like features in our model with emergent processing.\nFinally we try to relate parsimoniously the 'intrinsic contextuality approach to cognition' to a model\nof consciousness. From a conservative point of view, consciousness indicates a capacity 'to perceive\nthe being in the world', as such reducing it to a cognitive state be it a centric one. To analyze this\nprocess in terms of the intrinsic contextuality approach. As a prerequisite, we let conceptualization be\nan acquired functionality of a context stimulated, feedback regulated, consistently referent, activity of\nthe neural network. Attention is directed by a number of factors which are expressed in the internal\ncontext and the shift of this context, and provides the present cognitive experience. Their relatively\nhybrid nature integrates and procures the cognitive experience. To extend cognition to consciousness is\nthen to direct the mental context to this proper context itself as subject. In common cognitive tasks, the\n\n11\n\n\fmental context is in an emergent relation to the conceptual entities, the refocusing in consciousness does\nnot fit that common configuration. The practical 'impossibility' to subject the mental context to itself\nin an act of thought, indicates to some extent the evanescent nature of consciousness. In effect such an\nattempt probably converts to experiencing these components of the internal context that relate to proper\nexistence.\nThe present elementary and speculative account for the process of consciousness is based directly on\nthe intrinsic contextuality model in cognition and its translation of 'proper reflection'. Its merit lies in\nthe consistency with the ontology of precedent concept+context analysis and its parsimonious plainness.\nThis account puts the essential dynamics of cognition and consciousness in the context directing capacity\nof the mind, a process not accounted for here.\n\n3.2\n\nThe Amplification Model of Consciousness\n\nFundamental approaches bypass the problem of getting consciousness from non-conscious components by\npositing that consciousness is a universal primitive (Chalmers 1996, Dyson 1979, Feigl 1958/1979, Edelman and Tonini 2000, Foster 1989, Ghose and Aurobindo 1998, Griffin 1998, Hartshorne 1968, Lockwood\n1989, Montero 2001, Nagel 1979, Russel 1926, Scott 1995, Stoljar 2001, Strawson 2000, Whitehead 1929).\nThe double aspect theory of information, for example, holds that information has a phenomenal aspect\n(Chalmers 1996). How then do you get from phenomenal information to human consciousness? Our\nemphasis here on the interface between cognitive state and context might appear to suggest we believe\nthat consciousness is uniquely associated with a particular kind of cognitive, or perhaps organic, structure. Our position, however, is consistent with the view that subjectivity of some very primitive form\nis ubiquitous, and that these structures merely locally amplify this subjectivity to give rise to what we\ngenerally view as full-fledged consciousness (Gabora 2000, Gabora 2002). It has been proposes that an\nentity is conscious to the extent it amplifies information, first by trapping and integrating it through\nclosure, and second by maintaining dynamics at the edge of chaos through simultaneous processes of\ndivergence and convergence. The origin of life through autocatalytic closure induced phase transitions in\nthe degree to which information, and thus consciousness, is locally amplified. Another such phase transition may have taken place with the origin of an interconnected worldview through conceptual closure\n(Gabora 1998, Gabora 1999, Gabora 2002, Gabora and Deses 2002).\nConceptual closure is a process whereby memories become increasingly able to evoke one another\nmediated by the formation of abstract concepts, and eventually form an interconnected internal model of\nthe world. It has been proposed that the capacity for conceptual closure came about approximately two\nmillion years ago when the human memory became large enough that episodes could afford to be more\nwidely distributed, leading to the formation of a hierarchical network of abstract concepts. It has also\nbeen proposed that the capacity to alternate between focused and defocused modes of thought led to the\ncapacity for conceptual closure at multiple hierarchical levels spanning different domains, and that this\nis what gave rise to the creative revolution of the Upper Paleolithic. Such a conceptual structure is able\nto creatively fine-tune plans, predictions, ideas and fantasies by evaluating situations in terms of past\nexperiences, stories, and schemas, update opinions by considering them from different perspectives, and\nmerge concepts to generate new concepts (which, liked quantum entities, often have properties not present\nin the constituents). All of these involve contextuality, revising one thing by viewing it in the context\nof another. Thus we move toward a picture in which closure, quantum structure, and contextuality are\nthree intimately connected aspects of the process through which consciousness has become amplified.\nAt the deep level of formal theories, there is in fact a tight connection between quantum structure, and\nclosure, which we discuss here briefly to give the reader a flavor of what this could imply for cognition. We\nframe this explanation using the lattice theoretic generalized quantum formalism, because it is here that\nthis connection is revealed most clearly, though since the generalized quantum formalisms are translatable\none into the other, the connection between closure and quantum structure could be analyzed using any\none of them. In the lattice approach, the basic mathematical concepts for describing a physical entity,\nwhether it be purely classical, purely quantum, or of the more general sort of structure referred to as\nquantum-like, are (1) a state space and (2) a set of properties. Axioms are defined on the state space and\nthe set of properties, thus turning the whole into a state-property system (Aerts 1998, Aerts 2002). The\nentity under consideration is a classical entity if the lattice is Boolean, and pure quantum if the lattice\nis irreducible. It can be shown that if all the axioms are satisfied, the state-property system can be\nrepresented as the direct union over a set \u03a9 of lattices formed out of the closed subspaces of a generalized\n\n12\n\n\fHilbert space (Aerts 1983, Aerts at al. 2001, Aerts and Deses 2002).\nThe pure classical situation corresponds to the case where all these generalized Hilbert spaces have\ndimension one, hence this direct union reduces to the set \u03a9 itself, which represents the phase space of the\nclassical entity. So the general theory reduces to a pure classical mechanical theory over phase space. The\npure quantum situation corresponds to the case where the set \u03a9 is a singleton, hence the direct union\nreduces to one generalized Hilbert space, which for the case wherein the division ring is the complex\nnumber field, reduces to the Hilbert space of pure quantum mechanics. So the general theory reduces\nto a pure quantum mechanical theory over Hilbert space. The general quantum entity is described by a\ndirect union over a phase space \u03a9 of closed subspaces of generalized Hilbert spaces. It is \u03a9 that enables\none to describe the classical aspects of the entity, and the closed subspaces of generalized Hilbert spaces\nthat allow for description of the quantum aspects.\nIt was recently proven that a state property system in the general quantum situation is categorically\nisomorphic with a closure structure on the state space (Aerts et al. 1999c, Van der Voorde 2000, Van\nSteirteghem 2000, Aerts et al. 2002b). The connected components of this closure structure are the pure\nquantum components of the generalized Hilbert spaces in the direct union, while the disconnected components are distributions over the phase space \u03a9 that represents the classical aspects of the considered\nentity (Aerts at al. 2001, Aerts and Deses 2002). Thus it appears that, at a deep formal level, the connected components of a closure system are the quantum components of that system, and the disconnected\ncomponents are the classical aspects. With respect to cognition, this tentatively suggests that closure of\nthe conceptual network which causes it to become interconnected by hierarchical levels of increasingly\nabstract concepts, causes the mind to acquire more quantum-like structure.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nThe contextual nature of conscious experience suggests that in order to formally model it we should look\nto the domain of science where contextuality has been most seriously addressed: quantum mechanics. We\nknow that conceptual entities always get evoked in some context. However the incorporation of context\ninto the formal description of a conceptual entity is one of the biggest unsolved problems in cognitive\nscience. Our formalism lends itself precisely to this problem.\nAn abstracted quantum mechanical representation of the entity-context interaction, with its hidden\ncreation of new states, was adapted to the description of the conceptualization process for various different kinds of cognitive situations. We showed that Bell inequalities-the definitive test for quantum\nstructure-are violated in the relationship between an abstract concept and instances or exemplars of\nthat concept.\nA formal \u01eb-model derived from quantum mechanics was adapted to the setting of an opinion pole,\nand identifies possible effects of intrinsic integration of opinion and questioning context, i.e. contextuallyelicited opinions.\nThe full quantum model of the specific conceptual entity the 'liar paradox' provided a case for complete\ncoercive contextuality and time evolution of a contextually subjected entity.\nAs in quantum mechanics, conscious experience consists of segments of dynamical evolution, which\nare not contextual and do not involve resolution of ambiguity or decision, and collapse events, which are\ncontext-dependent and involve a decision or the resolution of ambiguity. In both the quantum and the\ncognitive situation, both dynamical evolution and collapse are instances of context-driven actualization of\npotential. We believe that this actualizing of potential through contact with a context is the fundamental\nbasis of evolution and change.\nOur application of the general formalism still needs to be worked out in greater detail, and the\npredictions of the resulting 'contextualized' theory of cognition need to be empirically tested against\nother theories (such as prototype and exemplar theories of concepts), both through experiments with\nhuman subjects, and through simulations. We are also working on a description of the process by\nwhich pre-existing concepts or ideas merge to form new ones using the mathematics of entanglement and\ncollapse.\nIn conclusion, we believe consciousness to be an emergent, integrated process involving reflection of\nthe entity via the context, which can be fully described using an abstracted quantum formalism, and that\namplification through closure may also be involved.\n\n13\n\n\fReferences\nAccardi, L.
