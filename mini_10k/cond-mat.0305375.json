Among them,\nthe effect of randomness in one-dimensional quantum\nspin systems has been extensively studied theoretically\nand experimentally.1\u201313)\nThe real space renormalization group (RSRG) analysis\nof the S = 1/2 random bond antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain1\u20133) has shown that the ground state of the\nS = 1/2 uniform antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain\nis unstable against the bond randomness of infinitesimal strength and the random singlet phase is realized\nin which the spins form singlet pairs randomly with distant partners.3) In this phase, the spin-spin correlation\ndecays by the power law with exponent \u22122\n\u221a and logaveraged energy gap scales as < ln\u2206 >\u2243 \u2212\u03b1 N +const.,\nwhere N is the system size and \u03b1 is a constant. This has\nbeen confirmed numerically4) by means of the density\nmatrix renormalization group (DMRG) method.14)\nOn the other hand, the effect of randomness on the\nspin gap state of one-dimensional quantum spin systems\nhas been extensively studied5\u201311) related with the doping effect in bond-alternating chains8, 9) and spin ladders.10) Hyman and coworkers5, 6) have applied the\nRSRG method to the spin-1/2 random dimerized antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain and have shown that\nthe dimerization is a releveant perturbation to the random singlet phase.5, 6) This implies that the ground\nstate of the spin-1/2 dimerized antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain is stable against infinitesimal randomness.\nThey also argued that the ground state of this model\nis the random dimer phase which belongs to the quantum Griffiths phase in which the spin-spin correlation\nlength is finite and log-averaged energy gap scales as\n< ln\u2206 >\u223c \u2212zlnN + const. with finite dynamical exponent z. This is also verified by the DMRG calculation\nby the present author.7)\nMotivated by the quite distinct nature of the uniform\n\nchain and bond-alternating chain against randomness,\nAjiro and coworkers experimentally investigated the\nmagnetic properties of the compound CuCl2x Br2(1\u2212x) (\u03b3pic)2 12, 13) which is the mixed compound of S = 1/2\nuniform and bond-alternating antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chains. The x = 1 compound CuCl2 (\u03b3-pic)2 is an\nS = 1/2 bond-alternating antiferromagnetic Heisenberg\nchain15) and the x = 0 compound CuBr2 (\u03b3-pic)2 is an\nS = 1/2 uniform antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain.12)\nIn order to understand the low temperature magnetic\nproperties of these compounds, we theoretically investigate the ground state and low energy properties of the\nmixture of bond-alternating and uniform S = 1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chains using DMRG method\nin the present work.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In the next section,\nthe thoretical model which describes the mixed compound CuCl2x Br2(1\u2212x) (\u03b3-pic)2 is presented. In section 3,\nthe magnetization curve is calculated and the exchange\nparameters are determined from overall behavior of the\nmagnetization curve. The numerical results of the low\nenergy magnetic excitation spectrum is presented in section 4. Based on the finite size scaling analysis of the\nlog-averaged energy gap, the low temperature singularity of the magnetic suscsptibility is predicted and the\nexplanation of the experimentally observed temperature\ndependence of susceptibility data is given. The last section is devoted to summary and discussion.\n2.\n\nTheoretical Model of CuCl2x Br2(1\u2212x) (\u03b3-pic)2\n\nIn the compound CuCl2x Br2(1\u2212x) (\u03b3-pic)2 , the Cu-Cu\nbond is bibridged by Cl and/or Br ions, so that there exBr\nBr\nist Cu <Cl\nCl > Cu , Cu <Cl > Cu and Cu <Br > Cu bonds\nin this compound. In the pure compound CuCl2 (\u03b3-pic)2\n, two kinds of Cu <Cl\nCl > Cu bonds alternate along the\nchain, although this material appears to be a uniform\nchain from chemical formula. This bond alternation is\ninduced by the freezing transition of rotational motion\nof methyl-group at 50K.15) For finite Br-concentration\n\n\f2\n\nKazuo Hida\n\n(0 < x < 1), this compound can be regarded as an assembly of the finite length clusters connected only by the\nCu <Cl\nCl > Cu bonds (hereafter called 'bond-alternating\ncluster'; abbrivaiated as BAC) with Cu <Br\nBr > Cu and/or\nBr\nCu <Cl > Cu bonds in between. However, it is not obvious whether the rotational order of methyl-group remains long ranged even in the mixed compound. If this\norder is long ranged, the bond alternation pattern is common among different BAC's even though they are sepBr\narated by Cu <Br\nBr > Cu or Cu <Cl > Cu bonds. In\nwhat follows, this case is called fixed parity case. On the\nother hand, if the rotational order of methyl-group is\nalso cut into short range order by Br-substitution on Cl\nsites, the bond alternation patterns of the Cu <Cl\nCl > Cu\nbonds are uncorrelated among different BAC's once they\nBr\nare separated by Cu <Br\nCl > Cu or Cu <Br > Cu bonds.\nThis case is called random parity case. For the moment,\nthere is no experimental evidence which case is realized\nin CuCl2x Br2(1\u2212x) (\u03b3-pic)2 . In the following, we therefore investigate both cases theoretically.\nThe strength of these bonds are denoted by J (strong\nCl\nCu <Cl\nCl > Cu bond), \u03b1J (weak Cu <Cl > Cu bond),\n\u2032\u2032\nBr\nJ \u2032 (Cu <Br\nCl > Cu bond) and J (Cu <Br > Cu bond),\nrespectively in the following Hamiltonian which describes\nthe mixed chain.\n\nH=\n\nN\nX\n\nJ\n\u03b1J\nJi =\nJ\u2032\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nJ \u2032\u2032\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\nFixed\nParity\n\nA\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nin phase\n\nB\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n2Ji S i S i+1 ,\n\n(1)\n\nfor i + ip = even\nfor i + ip = odd\n\n\u001b\n\np = x2 ,\n\np = 2x(1 \u2212 x),\np = (1 \u2212 x)2 ,\n(2)\nwhere p is the probability of realization of each type of\nbonds. We define the integer 'parity' ip for each BAC.\nCorresponding to the fixed and random parity cases explained above, the parity ip takes the following values in\neach cases.\n(1) Random parity case : ip takes the values 0 or 1\nrandomly in different BAC's.\n(2) Fixed parity case : ip = 0 for all BAC's.\nThe possible local bond configurations realized in each\ncase can be visually explained using Fig. 1. The uppermost configuration R shows the regular bond-alternating\nchain corresponding to CuCl2 (\u03b3-pic)2 . The local configurations of type-A and B can occur in the mixed chain\nCuCl2x Br2(1\u2212x) (\u03b3-pic)2 . The two BAC's in type-A configuration are in phase with regular chain R. On the other\nhand, in type-B configuration, the left BAC in the solid\nrectangle is in phase with R while the right BAC in the\ndotted rectangle is out of phase from R. The local configurations of type-A and B (with its mirror inversion)\noccur with the same weight in the random parity case\nbut only type-A configuration occurs in the fixed parity\ncase.\n\nRandom\nParity\n\n100%\n\n50%\n\n0%\n\n50%\n\nin phase\n\n\u2212\n\nin phase\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nout of phase\n\nFig. 1.

The thick\nlines denote the Cu <Br > Cu or Cu <Br > Cu bonds and the\nBr\nCl\nthin single and double lines, the alternating Cu <Cl > Cu bonds.\nCl\nThe uppermost configuration R corrsponds to the regular bondalternating chain (CuCl2 (\u03b3-pic)2 ). Two possible local bond\nconfigurations in the mixed chain CuCl2x Br2(1\u2212x) (\u03b3-pic)2 are\nshown as A and B. The clusters in the rectangles are bondalternating clusters (BAC's). In the random parity case, the\ntype-A and type-B configurations occur with the same weight.\nIn the fixed parity case, only type-A configuration occurs.\n\n3.\n\nMagnetizaton Process\n\nFrom the measurement for the pure systems (x =\n0, 1), the coupling constants J, \u03b1 and J \u2032\u2032 are determined\nas,12, 13)\nJ = 13.2K, J \u2032\u2032 = 20.3K, \u03b1 = 0.6.\n\ni=1\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\nRegular bond alternating chain\nR\n\n(3)\n\nUsing these parameters, we have calculated the magnetization curve of the mixed chain using DMRG method\nfor various choices of J \u2032 and determined J \u2032 /J = 1.3\nso as to reproduce the overall magnetization curve of\nCuCl2x Br2(1\u2212x) (\u03b3-pic)2 . The chain length N is fixed\nto 100 and the average is taken over 100 samples. The\nmaximum number of the states kept in each subsystem\nin the course of DMRG calculation is 300. It should be\nnoted that the overall magnetization curve does not depend whether the parity is fixed or random, except for\nthe low field part where the magnetization curve is more\nconvex in the random parity model as shown in Fig. 2.\nThe low field part of the magnetization curve reported in\nrefs. 12 and 13 seems to be consistent with the random\nparity model. However, due to the finite temperature effect in the experimental data and finite size effect in the\nnumerical calculation, the direct quantitative comparison is difficult. Actually, the most significant difference\nbetween the two models is the low field singularity of the\nmagnetization determined by the low energy singularity\nof the magnetic excitation spectrum. At finite temperatures, however, this singularity is rounded to yield finite\nmagnetic susceptibility which diverges or vanishes as the\ntemperature is lowered. Therefore, for the quantitative\ncomparison with experiment, we concentrate on the low\ntemperature singularity of the susceptibility which can\nbe deduced from the finite size scaling analysis of the low\nenergy magnetic excitation spectrum in the next section.\n\n\fMixture of Bond-Alternating and Uniform S = 1/2 Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Chains\n\n0.6\nrandom parity\nfixed parity\n\nM\n\nx=1\n\n0.4\n\nx=0.6\n\nx=0\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nH\n\n3\n\nFig. 2. Magnetization curves of the fixed parity model (solid line)\nand random parity model (dotted line) with x = 0.6. The stepwise lines are the magnetization processes of pure systems (x = 0\nand x = 1). For x = 0.6, the error bars are comparable with the\nwidth of the lines.\n\n4.\n\n3\n\nIn the experiment, it is found that the low temperature susceptibility of CuCl2x Br2(1\u2212x) (\u03b3-pic)2 shows a\ndivergent behavior as \u03c7 \u223c T \u03b2\u22121 with an exponent\n\u03b2 \u223c 0.67.12, 13, 16) The value of \u03b2 slightly depends on\nthe concentration x. At first sight, the above result appears to be consistent with the prediction of the fixed\nparity model, if we identify z = 1/\u03b2 as proposed in ref.\n12. Based on this idea, we determine the exponent z by\nfitting < ln\u2206 > in Fig. 3 by Eq. (4). The result is shown\nin Fig. 4 in terms of \u03b2 = 1/z. Although the value of \u03b2\nfor small x is difficult to determine from the numerical\ndata, we may expect it would roughly behave as shown\nby the dotted line considering that \u03b2 = 1 for x = 0\n(Luttinger liquid). The exponent \u03b2 is, however, always\nlarger than or around unity as shown in Fig. 4 within\nthe regime x \u2265 0.4. Therefore the fixed parity model\ndoes not explain the experimentally observed exponent\n\u03b2 \u223c 0.67. Actually, if we look into the experimental\ndata closely, the exponent \u03b2 turns out to decrease with\nx, although the temperature of the experiment is not low\nenough to exclude the contribution of higher energy excitations. On the contrary, in the fixed parity model, \u03b2\n> 0.4 as shown in Fig.\nincreases rapidly with x for x \u223c\n4. The physical reason of the sharp increase of \u03b2 is obvious. In the limit x \u2192 1, the system is gapped, so that\nz should tend to zero.\n\nLow energy magnetic excitation spectrum\n\n4.1 Fixed parity case\nThe lowest excitation gaps with total magnetization\nSztot = 1 for each sample is calculated using the infinite\nsize DMRG method4) for 10 \u2264 N \u2264 80 (x \u2264 0.5) and for\n10 \u2264 N \u2264 160 (x \u2265 0.6). The average is taken over 200\nsamples. The number of the states kept in each subsystem during the course of the DMRG calculation is 60.\nThe accuracy is confirmed by checking the coincidence\nz\nof the energy gap with (Stot , Stot\n) = (1, 0) and that with\nz\n(Stot , Stot ) = (1, 1) taking into account the SU (2) symmetry of the present system.\nThe log-averaged energy gap < ln\u2206 > is plotted\nagainst lnN in Fig. 3 which show a fairly good linear\nbehavior\n< ln\u2206 >= ln\u22060 \u2212 zlnN,\n\n(4)\n\nfor large N and x \u2265 0.4. For x \u2264 0.3, the data are\nnot well fitted by (4). Presumably, in this regime, the\nconcentration of the alternating bond x2 is too small\nand true asymptotic behavior is not observable for the\npresent system sizes. This result implies that the ground\nstate of this model is the quantum Griffiths phase characterized by the finite dynamical exponent z at least for\nx \u2265 0.4. In the quantum Griffiths phase, the low temperature susceptibility \u03c7(T ) and low field magnetization at\nzero temperature M (H) should behave as \u03c7(T ) \u223c T 1/z\u22121\nand M (H) \u223c H 1/z .5, 6)\nPhysically, this result is reasonable. In this model, the\ndimerization pattern is fixed over the whole system. As\npointed out by Hyman and coworkers,5) the dimerization\nis a relevant perturbation to the random singlet phase\nand drives the system into the random dimer phase which\nbelongs to the quantum Griffiths phase.\n\n<ln\u2206>\n\n0\n\n\u22121\nx\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22123\n\n0\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n\nuniform\n\nalternating chain\n3\n\n4\n\nln N\n\n5\n\nFig. 3. System size dpendence of < ln\u2206 > in the fixed parity case.\nThe gap is measured in units of J.\n\n4.2 Random parity case\nIn this case also, the lowest excitation gaps with total\nmagnetization Sztot = 1 for each sample is calculated\nusing the DMRG method for N \u2264 80 in the same way\nas in the preceding subsection. The maximum number\nm of the state kept in the course of DMRG calculation\nis m = 200.\nThe log-averaged\n\u221a magnetic energy gap < ln\u2206 > is\nplotted against N in Fig. 5 which show a fairly good\nlinear behavior\n\u221a\n< ln\u2206 >= ln\u22060 \u2212 \u03b1 N .\n(5)\n\n\f4\n\nKazuo Hida\n\n\u03b2\n\nTherefore, in the temperature range around T , we can\ndefine the temperature dependent effective value of z by\n\n2\n\nzeff (T ) =\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\nx 1\n\nFig. 4. The exponent \u03b2 plotted against x in the fixed parity case.\n\nThis implies that the ground state is the random singlet state in which the low temperature susceptibility \u03c7(T ) and low field magnetization at zero temperature M (H) should behave as \u03c7(T ) \u223c 1/(T (lnT )2 ) and\nM (H) \u223c (ln(1/H))\u22122 .3) In this case, the dimerization\npattern is not long ranged. Therefore the translational\nsymmetry is preserved on average and the random singlet\nphase remains stable.\nHowever, it should be noted that this asymptotic form\nfor \u03c7 is only valid in the true low temperature limit.\nAt finite temperatures, we may define the temperature\ndependent effective value of z even in the random parity\ncase in the following way.\n<ln\u2206>0\n\nx=1\nalternating\nchain\nuniform\nchain\nx=0\n\n\u22122\n\n1\n\u22060\nln(\n)\n2 kB T\n\n(8)\n\nby setting < ln\u2206 >= ln(kB T ) in (7).\nFrom the fit to (5) we have determined the value of\n\u22060 . Around the temperature range where the measure> 2K), the values of the effective\nment is made (T \u223c\nexponent \u03b2eff (T ) \u2261 1/zeff (T ) are plotted against T in\nFig. 6 for avrious values of x. They are also plotted\nagainst x for T = 2K and 4K in Fig. 7. It is clearly\nseen that \u03b2eff ranges from 0.4 to 0.7 for 0.8 \u2265 x \u2265 0.2 .\nThis explains why the measured susceptibility exponent\nis around these values. Especially, at the fixed temperature, the exponent \u03b2 decreases with x in accordance with\nthe experimental tendency.\nPhysically, the x-dependence of \u03b2eff is understood as\nfollows. The quantity \u22060 is essentially the bare energy\nscale of the system. In the spirit of RSRG method for\nrandom quantum spin chains,1\u20133) it is of the order of the\nlargest exchange coupling 2J \u2032\u2032 \u223c 40.6K which is decimated in the first step renormalization. Therefore we\nmay roughly estimate as \u03b2eff \u223c 2/ln(2J \u2032\u2032 /kB T ) \u223c 0.66\nat T = 2K and this value is insensitive to x. However, as\nx appraoches zero, the ground state should tend to the\nLuttinger liquid characterized by z = \u03b2 = 1. Therefore\n\u03b2eff increases to approach this value with the decrease\nof x. Actually, for small x, there exist many large uniform clusters coupled with the strongest bond J \u2032\u2032 so that\nthe first step renormalization cannot start with the single bond. Therefore, the effective value of \u22060 is reduced\nfrom J \u2032\u2032 and \u03b2eff is enhanced.\n\n\u03b2eff x=0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n1\n\nx=0.2\n\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n\n0.7\n0.8\n\nx=0.4\nx=0.6\n\nx=0.8\n\n\u22124\n4\n\n0.5\n6\n\n8 N1/2\n\nFig. 5.

The effective exponent \u03b2eff plotted against Cl concentration x.\n\nand fixed parity cases are similar to each other except\nfor the low field singularity which reflects the low energy\nspectrum. Comparing with the experimental magnetization curve for CuCl2x Br2(1\u2212x) (\u03b3-pic)2 the exchange parameters are determined. The low field magnetization\ncurve of CuCl2x Br2(1\u2212x) (\u03b3-pic)2 looks similar to that of\nthe random parity case although the direct comparison\nis difficult due to the finite temperature effect in experiment and finite size effect in numerical calculation.\nFor the quantitative analysis of the low field limit,\nthe low energy energy spectrum obtained by the DMRG\nmethod is analyzed using the finite size scaling method.\nThe ground state is the random singlet phase for the\nrandom parity model and it is the quantum Griffiths\nphase in the fixed parity model. The low temperature\nsingularity of the experimentally observed susceptibility\nof CuCl2x Br2(1\u2212x) (\u03b3-pic)2 is consistent with the theoretical results for the random parity model assuming the\ntemperature dependent effective exponent \u03b2eff .\nIt should be noted that our calculation predicts that\nthe effective value of \u03b2 decreases with the Cl concentra< 0.5. Although this seems to be compatible\ntion for x \u223c\nwith the experimental data, more precise measurement\nof susceptibility at lower temperatures is hoped in the\n\n1) S.-k. Ma, C.
