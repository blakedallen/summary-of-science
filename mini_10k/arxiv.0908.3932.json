Parity-state encoding is used at the lowest level of code concatenation in order to efficiently\ncorrect errors arising from the inherent nondeterminism of two-qubit linear-optical gates. When\ncombined with teleported error-correction (using either a Steane or Golay code) at higher levels of\nconcatenation, the parity-state scheme is found to achieve a saving of approximately three orders\nof magnitude in resources when compared to a previous scheme, at a cost of a somewhat reduced\nnoise threshold.\nPACS numbers: 42.50Dv\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIt was shown by Knill, Laflame, and Milburn (KLM)\n[1] that, in principle, scalable optical quantum computing could be achieved using only passive linear elements, single-photon sources, measurement and feedforward. Non-deterministic gates were developed that failed\nthrough the accidental measurement of qubit value. Parity state error codes were developed to protect against\nsuch accidental measurement. KLM showed that, by\nconcatenating the parity codes, gate failures could be reduced to arbitrarily small levels, thus justifying the claim\nof scalibility. However, because of the massive complexity of the scheme, it has not been practical to couple it to\na higher level error correction protocol capable of correcting environmental errors, and hence evaluate its resource\nrequirements and fault tolerant threshold.\nA major simplification of the KLM circuit approach\nwas achieved by the introduction of incremental parity\ncodes [2] and fusion gate techniques [3, 4]. We refer to\nthis modification of KLM as parity state quantum computing. These techniques reduce the complexity of the\nscheme sufficiently that it becomes possible to make a\nfull fault tolerant analysis, thus completing the original\nKLM program.\nIn this paper, we derive the resource usage and error thresholds achievable when a concatenated errorcorrecting code such as the Steane code [5] is used to\nto handle environmental and residual gate errors in the\nparity-state optical quantum computing scheme. This\ntype of analysis has previously been done for cluster state\n[6] and coherent state [7] schemes. It is important to establish these thresholds for the parity-state implementation both as a target for technological development, and\nfor comparison with the other proposals. Our results\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: ahayes@physics.uq.edu.au\n\nshow that the parity-state protocol may offer a useful\ntrade-off between the higher resource usage of clusterstate schemes and the lower noise threshold of coherent\nstate schemes.\nSignificant progress has been made in optical quantum\ncomputing experiments in the last decade [8].In particular the basic principles of optical parity state production\nand their ability to correct Z-measurement errors has\nbeen demonstrated [9, 10, 11]. These promising experiments indicate that effective use of such error-correcting\ncodes in future designs is viable.\nThe layout of the paper as follows. Section II gives a\nbrief review and introduction of parity encoding and the\noperations that may be done on parity-encoded states.\nSection III describes the physical noise model that we\nconsider, and gives expressions for the effective noise\nrates on various parity-encoded operations. In Section IV\nthese error-rate expressions are used as the basis of simulations of higher levels of encoding. The results of the\nsimulations are presented in the form of noise-threshold\ncurves. Finally, Section V considers the resources required by this scheme, and provides a comparison with\nthe thresholds and resource requirements of some other\nschemes for fault-tolerant optical quantum computation.\n\nII.\n\nUNIVERSAL GATE SET\n\nThis section describes the states and operations used\nin the two lowest levels of encoding in our scheme: the\nphysical qubits in the dual-rail nondeterministic linearoptical architecture, and the first level of logical qubits\nwhich use parity-state encoding. These designs lead to\nthe central focus of this paper, a discussion of the effects\nof noise on the parity-state encoding and the effects of\nhigher levels of encoding (fault-tolerant Steane and Golay\nencoding), which is covered in Sections III\u2013V.\n\n\f2\nA.\n\nPhysical Encoding and Operations\n\nAt the physical level, qubits in our scheme are encoded\nand manipulated according to the techniques of nondeterministic dual-rail linear optics. Although other implementations, such as spatial encoding, are possible, we\nwill explicitly consider polarisation qubits, encoded in\nthe horizontal and vertical polarisation modes of single\nphotons. This entails a series of physical and technological assumptions including: that single-photon states can\nbe produced on-demand in a desired mode, such modes\ncan be made to interact using mode-matched linear optics, modes can be stored in a quantum memory, and, the\nnumber of photons in a mode can be measured and the results used in the fast control of optical switching. Singlequbit operations in this scheme are relatively straightforward, but two-qubit gates are inherently nondeterministic even in the absence of noise.\nAs in reference [3], our scheme utilises two particularly simple nondeterministic two-qubit gates, the socalled type-I (fI ) and type-II (fII ) fusion gates (Fig 1). A\ntype-II fusion gate performs a two-qubit destructive measurement in the basis {|00i + |11i, |00i \u2212 |11i, |01i, |10i}.\nThe first two outcomes (corresponding to maximallyentangled basis elements) are considered \"successful\",\nwhereas the second two outcomes are considered to be\nfailures of the gate. A type-I fusion gate is a partial\nBell measurement on two qubits. Two outcomes, considered successful, project the input state into the space\nspanned by {|00i, |11i} and outputs a single qubit according to the operator |0ih00| \u00b1 |1ih11|. Again, there\nare two failure outcomes which correspond to a destructive measurement in the basis {|01i, |10i}.\nFor the type of input states we will consider, both the\ntype-I and type-II fusion gates are successful with 50%\nprobability (in the absence of noise).\nB.\n\nParity Encoding\n\nA length-n parity code encodes one logical qubit into\nn physical qubits. The logical basis states of the code,\ndenoted |0i(n) and |1i(n) , are defined to be:\n\u221a\n\u2297n\n\u2297n\n|0i(n) \u2261 (|+i + |\u2212i )/ 2\n\u221a\n|1i(n) \u2261 (|+i\u2297n \u2212 |\u2212i\u2297n )/ 2,\n(1)\n\u221a\nwhere |\u00b1i = (|0i \u00b1 |1i)/ 2. Note that |0i(n) is the equal\nsuperposition of all even-parity n-bit strings, and |1i(n) is\nthe equal superposition of all odd-parity strings. A useful\nproperty of the parity code basis states is that they have\na simple expansion in terms of smaller code states:\n\u221a\n|0i(n) = (|0i(n\u2212j) |0i(j) + |1i(n\u2212j) |1i(j) )/ 2, (2)\n\u221a\n|1i(n) = (|1i(n\u2212j) |0i(j) + |0i(n\u2212j) |1i(j) )/ 2, (3)\nwhere 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 1. For j = 1 this expansion shows\nthat a computational basis measurement (such as occurs\n\nFIG. 1: a) The type-I fusion gate. b) The type-II fusion gate. Here the gates are shown being performed on\ntwo polarization-encoded photonic input qubits, Q1 and Q2 .\nThese input qubits are typically part of larger entangled\nstates. The gates are constructed from photon-counting detectors, polarising beam-splitters, and half-wave plates, where\nthe half-wave plates act as Hadamard operations on the polarization qubits.\n\nwith a failed fusion gate) of one of the physical qubits will\nnot destroy a parity-encoded qubit, but will only reduce\nthe length of encoding by one (and possibly introduce\na known logical Pauli X operation, depending on the\nmeasurement outcome).\n\nC.\n\nGenerating Parity States\n\nThe production of parity-encoded states is a necessary\nprocedure both for the preparation of encoded qubits as\nsources, and as part of the resource generation required\nby some of the non-deterministic logical gates in our universal gate set for parity-encoded qubits.\nThe state |0i(n) is locally equivalent to a star shaped\ncluster state (by a Hadamard operation applied to the\ncentral node of the star). Consequently, given a supply\nof Bell states (|0i(2) ), the resource |0i(n) can be built up\nusing essentially the same techniques as used in [3] to\nbuild up star-shaped cluster states.\nParity states |0i(n) and |0i(m) can be fused using the\nfI gate as follows:\n\u001a\n|0i(m+n\u22121)\n(success)\nHfI (H\u2297H)|0i(n) |0i(m) \u2192\n|+i\u2297n\u22121 |\u2212i\u2297m\u22121 (failure)\n(4)\n(where we have omitted other possible locally equivalent\noutcomes for both success and failure). The operator\nHfI (H \u2297 H) should be understood as a Hadamard gate\nacting on one of the physical qubits from each of the\nencoded states, followed by the fI gate applied to the\n\n\f3\nsame pair, followed by a Hadamard gate applied to the\noutput of fI in the case of success. Alternatively the fII\ngate can be used to carry out fusion, as follows:\nfII |0i(n) |0i(m) \u2192\n\n\u001a\n\n|0i(m+n\u22122)\n(success)\n|0i(m\u22121) |0i(n\u22121) (failure)\n\n(5)\n\n(again, some additional locally-equivalent outcomes have\nbeen omitted).\nThe first alternative, where fI is used with Hadamard\ngates to perform fusion, has the advantage of losing only\na single physical qubit from the input states, but the\ndisadvantage of completely destroying the entanglement\nin both input states in the event of failure. In the second\ncase, fII is used to join the input states at the expense of\nlosing two of the initial physical qubits. There are three\nadvantages to the second scheme - in the case of failure\nwe do not destroy the entanglement of the input states,\njust reduce their encoding by one; we do not need photon\nnumber discriminating detectors to operate fII ; and it\nis failsafe with respect to loss, in the sense that a lost\nphoton will not cause a failed fII gate to appear to have\noperated successfully.\nThus, to create the state |0i(3) , two |0i(2) are fused\ntogether using the fI gate. Since fI functions with a\nprobability of 1/2, on average two attempts are necessary\nso on average each |0i(3) consumes 4|0i(2) . Once there is\na supply of |0i(3) states, either fI or fII can be used to\nprogressively build up larger resource states.\n\nD.\n\nSimple Single-Qubit Gates\n\nFor the parity code, encoded single-qubit unitaries can\nbe divided into those which have a particulary simple deterministic implementation, and those which have a more\ncomplicated nondeterministic implementation involving\nthe consumption of resource states.\nWe can deterministically perform encoded versions of\nany of the gates in the set {X\u03b8 , Z}. Here, X\u03b8 refers to an\narbitrary rotation about the X-axis of the Bloch sphere,\nX\u03b8 = cos(\u03b8/2)I + i sin(\u03b8/2)X. An encoded X\u03b8 operation\nis achieved by applying X\u03b8 to just one physical qubit\nin the code state. The encoded Z gate is achieved by\napplying a Z gate transversally to all physical qubits in\nthe code state.\n\nthe following generalization of Equation 5:\n\u001a\n|\u03a8i(m+n\u22122)\n(success)\n(n)\n(m)\nfII |\u03a8i |0i\n\u2192\n, (6)\n(m\u22121)\n(n\u22121)\n|\u03a8i\n|0i\n(failure)\nwhere |\u03a8i(n) \u2261 \u03b1|0i(n) + \u03b2|1i(n) is an arbitrary parityencoded input state, and like Equation 5 we have omitted\nother locally-equivalent outcomes.\nTo re-encode a logical qubit |\u03a8i(n) , a type-II fusion\ngate is first performed between the logical qubit and another ancillary parity state |0i(n+1) . Then, each of the\nremaining n \u2212 1 qubits that belonged to the original encoded input state are measured in the computational basis, leaving the new ancilla qubits in the same state as\nthe original input, |\u03a8i(n) . A logical X operation may be\nrequired as a correction depending on the total parity of\nthe measurements made.\nA slight modification of this procedure yields the encoded Z90 gate. Let\n|\u03a8i(n) = \u03b1(|0i(n\u22121) |0iI + |1i(n\u22121) |1iI ) +\n(n\u22121)\n\n\u03b2(|0i\n\nZ90 Gate\n\nTo make our set of encoded single-qubit gates universal, we add the Z90 operation. Similar to the notation\nintroduced in the previous subsection, Z90 refers to a\nrotation by 90 degrees around the Z-axis of the Bloch\nsphere.\nThe logical Z90 operation is based on the process of reencoding. Re-encoding can be understood by considering\n\n|1iI + |1i\n\n(7)\n\n|0iI )\n\nbe the logical qubit on which we wish to perform an encoded Z90 operation. One of the component physical\nqubits (here denoted by the subscript I) is chosen to represent the input for the type-II fusion in the re-encoding\nprocedure. To achieve an encoded Z90 gate on |\u03a8i(n) , we\nsimply apply the un-encoded Z90 gate to qubit I, then\ncarry out the re-encoding procedure detailed above. The\nfinal logical state following a successful fusion is Z90 |\u03a8i.\nIn this case, a correction corresponding to a logical Y\noperation may need to be applied to the output state\ndepending on the parity of the measurements made. In\nthe event that the fusion gate fails, the size of the input\nstate is reduced, and the operation may be re-attempted\nif there are enough remaining qubits. If all qubits in the\ninput state are depleted, then the logical gate is considered to have failed.\nTo implement a logical Hadamard operation in this\ngate set we use the decomposition H = X90 Z90 X90 .\nSince operations of the form X\u03b8 are relatively easy to\nperform, the logical Hadamard is essentially equivalent\nto the Z90 gate in terms of difficulty, time taken, and\nerror emergence.\n\nF.\nE.\n\n(n\u22121)\n\n\u2032\nXX90\nGate\n\nWe define two maximally-entangling two-qubit gates\n\u2032\nXX90 and XX90\nas follows:\n1\nXX90 \u2261 \u221a (I1 I2 \u2212 iX1 X2 ),\n2\n\u2032\nXX90 \u2261 (X\u221290 \u2297 X\u221290 )XX90 .\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\n\u2032\nThe relationship between the XX90 , XX90\nand controlled\nnot (cnot) gates is shown in Figure 2 in circuit form.\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 2: The relationship between the XX90 gate and the cnot\ngate. The combined operation inside the dotted area defines\n\u2032\nthe XX90\ngate.\n\ntempt the fII gates between the inputs and the resource\nstate. If both of the fII gates fail, the corresponding encoded input qubits will be reduced in size by one and the\ngate can be re-attempted. Note that if one of the fII gates\nfails and the other succeeds, then one of the input states\nwill be reduced in size by one but the other input effectively retains its size, if we consider one of the remaining\nqubits in the resource state to now belong to the particular encoded input that corresponds to the fusion gate\nthat succeeded.\nThe procedure described above provides an encoded\n\u2032\nXX90\ngate which on average decreases the size of its\ninputs by one. A simple modification can be made to\nthe resource-state generation circuit so that the resulting gate will instead on average preserve the size of its\ninputs. The modification involves treating the first and\nfourth qubits in Figure 3 as length-2 parity qubits instead of physical qubits, meaning that the resource state\nis now a state of 6 physical qubits. We will make use\n\u2032\nof this version of the XX90\ngate in the remainder of the\npaper.\n\nIII.\n\nANALYSIS OF ERRORS\nA.\n\nFIG. 3: The circuit used to create the resource state |RXXi\n\u2032\nused in implementing the XX90\ngate. The circuit can be modified by treating the top and bottom qubits as length-2 parity\nencoded qubits in order to improve the nondeterministic behaviour of the gate.\n\n\u2032\nXX90 and XX90\nhave the useful property that the parityencoded versions of these gates can be achieved by applying just one copy of the unencoded gate to a pair of\nphysical qubits (where one physical qubit is selected from\neach of the encoded input blocks).\n\u2032\nAn unencoded XX90\ncan be achieved nondeterministically as follows. First, a four-qubit resource state is\ncreated using the circuit shown in Figure 3. If the three\nfusion gates are successful, the resulting state is\n\n|RXXi =\n\n1\n[| + +i(|00i+|11i)+| \u2212 \u2212i(|01i+|10i)]. (10)\n2\n\nNext, two fII gates are applied between the input qubits\nand the resource state in the following manner: a fII gate\nis applied between a qubit of the first input and the first\nqubit of the resource state, and a fII gate is applied between a qubit of the second input and the fourth qubit of\nthe resource state. If both are successful, the remaining\n\u2032\ntwo qubits will be in the state XX90\n|\u03c8i, where |\u03c8i was\nthe input state (subject to possible known Pauli corrections).\nFor parity-encoded inputs the procedure is almost\nidentical, except that one has more opportunities to at-\n\nError Modelling\n\nThe theory of error correction in general requires that\nsome assumptions be made concerning the nature of errors that may occur in a system. The set of possible\nerrors that are considered, and their probability, form\nan error model on which the conclusions of a theory are\nbased. In developing error correction methods, the aim\nis to choose error models which closely match the physical reality. Typically, this involves focussing on the most\ncommon types of error found in the corresponding experimental systems. However, it is not always possible to\nmake the error model a detailed fit to the requirements\nof a particular system, especially when the technology is\nstill in development.\nIn optical quantum computing systems with single\nphotons, the greatest source of error is normally photon loss. This can occur in many different ways, including tunnelling, detection failure, imperfect coupling and\nunreliable sources. Another important type of error in\noptical systems is dephasing. It is expected that dephasing errors will typically be less frequent than loss errors\nin future optical computer components, but still likely to\nhave a significant effect in any large-scale quantum circuit. These errors can also be caused by imperfect coupling, or indeed any misalignment or flaw in the optical\nelements that can affect the polarization of the photon.\nWe use a simple error model for the noise on physical\nqubits. Each gate operation is divided into timesteps,\nwith a single timestep being roughly the time required to\nmake a measurement or set of measurements and perform\nfeedforward based on the results. Each physical qubit is\nconsidered to experience loss at a rate of \u03b3 per qubit per\n\n\f5\ntimestep, and Pauli errors at a rate of \u03b7 per qubit per\ntimestep. The Pauli error is selected randomly from the\nset {X, Y , Z} with equal probability. This corresponds\nto a depolarization error of rate 34 \u03b7, and to a marginal\nprobability of a bit-flip of 23 \u03b7. Depolarization errors are a\ngeneric way of representing the effects of dephasing noise,\nas well as other errors which act locally on each qubit and\ndo not cause leakage from the qubit state space.\nThe physical error model described above is used as the\nbasis for estimating the effective error rates on encoded\nqubits at higher levels of encoding. The relationship between the levels of encoding are summarised in Figure 4.\nAt each encoding level, the aim is to estimate the rates\nof two different error types: located errors, which are\nthose errors which are heralded (in a way analogous to\nthe failure of fusion gates at the physical encoding level),\nand unlocated errors, which are Pauli errors that are not\ndirectly heralded and must be found indirectly via syndrome measurement. The remainder of this section is devoted to deriving expressions approximating the effective\nerror rates of the various parity-encoded operations, i.e.,\noperations at the first level of encoding above the physical\nlevel. Then in the following section, these expressions are\nused as the error model for simulations of concatenated\nfault-tolerant teleported error correction (telecorrection),\nusing Steane and Golay coding.\nIn deriving expressions for the effective error rates at\nlevel 1, we use approximations which are correct only to\nfirst order in the physical error rate. In particular, we find\nthe probability that a qubit remains error-free after multiple timesteps by taking the product of the individual\nprobabilities of an error not occurring for each timestep.\nIn general, this is correct only to first order, since in reality multiple errors of the same type occurring on the\nsame qubit can cancel. For bit- or sign-flip errors of the\ntype included in our error model, an even number of errors has no overall effect on the qubit. However, since we\nare only considering very small values of physical error\nrate, and since each parity-encoded gate consists of only\na relatively small number of optical components, these\nhigher order error terms are insignificant.\nIt is important to note that this model assigns the same\nerror probability to a timestep regardless of whether a\nqubit was involved in operations during that time. Hence\nthis model takes into account errors that arise while a\nqubit is kept in memory, and assumes that such error\nrates are similar to those for a qubit actively involved in\ncomputation. This aspect of the model may be unduly\npessimistic, but we have chosen to consider the worst case\nin this regard.\nHaving defined the error model, it is also necessary\nto consider how these errors propagate through the elements of an optical system. First, it should be noted\nthat measurement in the Z basis renders any X errors\non that qubit irrelevant (likewise for Z errors and Xbasis measurements). Measurement also serves to locate\nloss errors. Due to the regular measurements that occur\nin our protocol (either directly or via a fusion gate), it\n\ncan be seen that loss errors will always be quickly transformed into located errors.\nThe properties of parity state encoding are such that\nany X errors on physical qubits immediately become X\nerrors on the logical, parity-encoded qubit. Hence the\nprobability of a logical X error will depend simply upon\nthe rate of such errors at the physical level, the number of\nqubits and the duration of the computation. Z errors on\nindividual photonic qubits do not automatically become\nlogical, however if a photonic qubit on which a Z error\nhas occurred is used as an input for a fusion gate, the\nerror is then applied to all the qubits forming the parity\nstate of which the input qubit was a member. We will use\n\u03b7X = \u03b7Z = 32 \u03b7 to denote the marginal error probabilities\nof X and Z errors (where Y is considered to be \"both\nan X and a Z error\"). This notation allows one at a\nglance to see which physical error type contributes to\na particular logical error rate in the expressions of the\nfollowing subsections.\n\nB.\n\nSize of the Parity Code\n\nThere is a trade-off in the located error rate for the\nnon-deterministic gates between the errors due to gate\nfailure and those due to loss (Figure 5). This occurs\nas each additional qubit in the encoding increases the\npossibility of a loss occurring. However, a certain level\nof encoding is necessary in order to reduce the probability of gate failure. We can optimise the size of the\nparity states by calculating the located error rates for\nthe non-deterministic operations examining how these errors vary with code size. Fortunately, the optimal parity\ncode size to minimize the trade-off is found to be similar\nfor both non-deterministic operations, with a seven qubit\ncode proving to offer the best threshold. All error rate\ncalculations will therefore assume a code of this size.\n\nC.\n\nSource Production\n\nWe assume that copies of the state |0i(7) are prepared\nas needed by massively parallel production in order to\nhave them ready when required by the circuit.\n\u221a We begin\nwith Bell pairs in the state (|00i + |11i)/ 2, and link\nthese by means of type-I and -II fusion gates. For a parity\nstate of size 7, 7 Bell pairs and 6 fusion gates are required\nto build the resource. As each gate has a 50% failure rate,\nparallel production of each resource requires an average\nof 7 \u00d7 26 Bell pairs, and takes 3 timesteps. The resulting\nstate has an unlocated X error rate of 1\u2212(1\u2212\u03b7X )41 and a\nlocated error rate of 1\u2212(1\u2212\u03b3)21 . (There are 41 locations\nin the optical circuit which can contribute errors to the\noutput state. For 20 of these locations, photon loss will\nbe immediately heralded, and so we post-select on no loss\noccurring at those locations).\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 4: The teleported error-corrector (telecorrector) circuit shown at different scales. This diagram demonstrates the manner\nin which logical operations are broken down into a series of operations at the lower layers of encoding. Box 1 shows the circuit\nfor the production of the resource required for one round of telecorrection. Box 2 demonstrates how a cnot gate on the\n\u2032\nSteane-encoded qubits can be performed using 7 XX90\ngates and 14 Hadamards at the parity encoding layer. Box 3 shows the\n\u2032\nprocess of using resource preparation plus teleportation to implement an XX90\ngate, and Box 4 provides the circuit used to\nprepare the required resource.\n\nD.\n\ninclude the factor\n\nZ90 Error Rates\n\nThis gate occurs in two steps: the first step is the attempt to fuse the encoded state with a resource state, and\nthe second step is measuring the remaining component\nqubits from the original state once a successful fusion has\nbeen performed. The probability of a failure at the first\nstep is:\n1\u2212\n\n7\nX\nj=1\n\n2\n\n\u2212j\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b3)\n\n1\n2 j(1+j)\n\n(11)\n\nwhich combines the possibility of a loss during fusion with\nthe fusion failure rate to get the total located error rate\nduring the fusion attempts. To cover the possibility of\nloss occurring on any of the other component qubits, we\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b3)3j+(1+j)(7\u2212j)\n\n(12)\n\nin the sum, which depends on the number of qubits remaining and the time they have been in memory.\nHence the Z90 gate has a combined located error rate\nper parity qubit of\nPLE = 1\u2212\n\n7\nX\n\n1\n\n2\u2212j (1\u2212\u03b3) 2 j(1+j) (1\u2212\u03b3)3j+(1+j)(7\u2212j) . (13)\n\nj=1\n\nFor unlocated errors, the average rate can be found by\ncombining the error rates for memory and for producing\nan ancillary parity state, due to the re-encoding process\nused to implement the gate. The average time required to\nimplement this gate would be 2 timesteps. However, for\n\n\f7\ninclude a scaling factor in the number of paths:\nNscaled (n, t) = 2\u2212\n\nt\u2212n\n2\n\nN (n, t).\n\n(15)\n\nThe number of first passage paths for this type of walk\nis\nn\n(16)\nF (n, t) = Nscaled(n, t).\nt\nTherefore, total probability of success per parity qubit in\nthe absence of loss is:\nPS = 1 \u2212\n\nFIG. 5: The probability of success for the XX90 gate as a\nfunction of the photon loss rate (1 \u2212 \u03b7) and code size n.\n\nall error types, it is assumed that the average time spent\nis 4 timesteps (this corresponds to the average time re\u2032\nquired for the slowest gate, XX90\n). This is done so that\nall encoded operation types can be treated as taking an\nequal amount of time. By counting the number of locations that may contribute to logical errors on the output,\nwe obtain overall effective rates of unlocated X and Z errors of 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b7X )69 and 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b7Z )10 respectively, for\nthe Z90 gate.\nE.\n\nXX90 Error Rates\n\nThe propagation of errors through this gate is fairly\nsimple: a Z-error on either input qubit will cause an Xerror on the opposite qubit. X-errors on an input qubit\npropagate to the output without having an effect on the\nother qubit.\nAs described in Section II F, the gate is achieved by\nperforming fusion gates between qubits from the encoded\ninput state and a 6-qubit resource state. As we are interested in an error rate per parity qubit, we model the\nsuccess or failure of the fusion gates applied to an input parity qubit using a random walk on a semi-infinite\n1-dimensional lattice with 1 absorbing boundary at \u2212n\n[12]. Here the lattice represents the size of the parity\nstate, with failure occurring either due to a loss or when\nall component qubits are measured due to repeated teleportation failures.\nThe number of paths that reach the boundary at time\nt is\nN (n, t) =\n\nt!\nt\u2212n\n( t+n\n2 !)( 2 !)\n\nN (n, t) = 0\n\nfor (t \u2212 n) mod 2 = 0 (14)\nfor (t \u2212 n) mod 2 = 1\n\nwhere n is the initial size of the parity code. To incorporate the possibility of a successful gate operation, we\n\n\u221e\nX\nF (n, t)\nt=n\n\n2t\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\nFor a parity qubit of size 7, this evaluates to PS = 0.9763.\nAs the average size of the state and the rate of loss per\ntimestep is constant, the average loss per parity qubit\nduring this operation can be simplified to:\nPL = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b3)t(n+3) .\n\n(18)\n\nThe average time taken for this operation is 4 timesteps.\nThus, the approximate located error rate per parityencoded input is 1 \u2212 0.9763(1 \u2212 \u03b3)40 . The unlocated X\nand Z error rates, obtained by counting error locations in\nthe average-time case, are 1\u2212(1\u2212\u03b7X )28 and 1\u2212(1\u2212\u03b7Z )4\nrespectively.\nF.\n\nMemory and Measurement\n\nThe memory or identity operation on an encoded qubit\nsimply entails keeping the constituent physical qubits in\nmemory while other operations are performed. We treat\nthe encoded memory operation as taking 4 time steps,\nequal to the average time taken to perform the slowest\n\u2032\n. This yields approximate rates of X,\nencoded gate, XX90\nZ, and located errors of 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b7X )28 , 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b7Z )4 ,\nand 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b3)28 respectively.\nAn encoded computational-basis measurement involves measuring each physical qubit in the computational basis and finding the parity of the measurement\nresults. Thus, the rates of located and unlocated errors in\nthe measurement outcome are 1\u2212(1\u2212\u03b3)7 and 1\u2212(1\u2212\u03b7X )7\nrespectively.\nIV.\n\nFAULT TOLERANCE THRESHOLD\n\nHaving analysed the emergence of logical errors at the\nparity code layer, we used numerical simulation to calculate the error rates at higher levels of concatenation,\nand from this, the value of the noise threshold for optical\nparity-state quantum computation.\nThe simulations were performed using similar techniques to those described in Sec V.D of [6]. In particular, we simulate one level of the telecorrector protocol, for both the 7-qubit (Steane) and 23-qubit (Golay) codes. Our simulation differs from [6] in the noise\n\n\f8\n\u22125\n\nx 10\nUnlocated error parameter, \u03b7\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n\nFIG. 8: Process for generating a 6 qubit parity state, beginning with 6 Bell states and performing two rounds of fusion\ngates.\n\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n1.5\nLocated error rate, \u03b3\n\n2\n\u22123\n\nx 10\n\nFIG. 6: The threshold curve for optical parity-state computing using the 7-qubit Steane code.

The telecorrector circuit in\n[6] uses the following gate set: preparation of |0i and\n|+i states, cnot, cphase, and X-basis measurement.\nWe converted this circuit to our gate set in the following way. First the circuit was expressed solely in\nterms of cphase gates, Hadamard gates, |+i creation\nand X-basis measurements, by making appropriate substitutions of each cnot gate, |0i creation, and computational basis measurements in the circuit, and simplifying the resulting circuit where possible. Then a simple\nchange of basis |0i \u2194 |+i, |1i \u2194 |\u2212i yielded a circuit in\n\u2032\nour gate set (XX90\ngates, Hadamard gates, |0i creation,\nand computational-basis measurement).\nWe carried out a series of Monte Carlo simulations for\na range of values of the physical error rates (\u03b3, \u03b7), in\neach case measuring the resulting rate of unlocated and\nlocated errors at the next highest level of encoding. For a\nparticular choice of the physical noise rates, Pauli errors\n(both unlocated and located) are introduced by each gate\nwith a probability that is governed by the noise model\nderived in the previous section. In the case of unlocated\nerrors, X and Z errors are introduced independently. For\n\n\u2032\nthe XX90\ngate, errors are introduced independently on\neach of the two output qubits.\nThe results of the simulations were used to characterise\nthe mapping of error rates from the physical level to the\nsecond level of encoding (i.e., the parity encoding plus\none level of telecorrection encoding) by way of a polynomial fit to the measured values. Our characterization\nof the mapping for all levels of encoding above this was\nobtained by simply using the particular polynomial that\nwas obtained in [6]. Thus, by applying the appropriate\nsequence of polynomials to a particular setting (\u03b3, \u03b7), we\nare able to estimate effective error rates at any level of\nencoding.\nThe threshold curve is defined to be the curve in the\n\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b7 plane below which effective error rates tend to zero\nfor many levels of encoding. Our calculated threshold\ncurves are shown in Figures 6-7 (the small circles show\nthe values of (\u03b3, \u03b7) for which a Monte Carlo simulation\nwas run). Like previous schemes for optical quantum\ncomputing, the results demonstrate a trade-off between\na tolerance of photon loss and depolarization errors. It\nis worth noting that the code is always required to deal\nwith some probability of located errors due to the nondeterministic gates and the finite size of the underlying\nparity encoding. These errors are taken into account\nwhen calculating the threshold for the loss and depolarizing rates plotted here.\n\nV.\n\nRESOURCES\n\nFor a useful comparison with other schemes for errorcorrecting quantum computing, it is necessary to also\nconsider the resources that would be required to implement this scheme. As noted previously, the method considered here for the creation of resources involves parallel production of many copies of a resource to ensure\nit is available on demand. This is a simple approach\nthat leads to a higher cost in terms of entangled photon\ngeneration, and avoids more complicated resource-saving\ntechniques such as storing previously prepared resources\nand \"recycling\" entangled states from unsuccessful attempts. Such techniques tend to require more intricate\ndesign and photon-switching, as well as potentially introducing more errors due to the longer photon storage\n\n\f9\ntime.\nWe calculate the resources required in terms of the\nnumber of Bell states used. This a useful unit to consider\nas it is a common starting point for building entangled\nstates across many optical schemes. It is also handy for\ncomparisons with current optical quantum computation\nexperiments as most use the entangled output of optical\nparametric down-conversion systems as photon sources.\nAs no recycling is used, the resource production has\na 50% chance of failing for every fusion gate performed,\nmeaning that the number of parallel attempts required\ndoubles with each fusion gate. This exponential growth\ncan be tolerated as it only occurs on a small scale \u2013 in\nour case none of the resource states need to be larger\nthan 8 qubits. To estimate the resources we calculate\nthe average number of Bell states required to produce\nthe appropriate resources using this parallel production\nmethod and implement a parity-encoded operation.\nMuch of this resource production simply involves the\ncreation of ancillary parity states, which is done by linking the initial Bell states together using type-I and -II\nfusion gates (Figure 8). State preparation at the parity\nlayer requires a 7-qubit parity state, which would take\nan average of 448 Bell pairs to produce. Re-encoding,\nand hence the Z90 operation, would require an 8-qubit\nparity state for each attempt, and an average of two attempts to implement the operation. Hence we estimate\nthe resources for the Z90 operation at 2048 Bell pairs on\n\u2032\nreaverage. The circuit for the preparation of the XX90\nsource was shown previously in Figure 3. This resource\nrequires an average of 128 Bell pairs to produce.\nAs a basis for comparison, we will consider the requirements for producing the telecorrector state needed for\none round of correction. Using the gate costs described\nabove, it can be calculated that the state requires approximately 177670 Bell pairs to generate. In Table I\nresource usage and threshold values are compared between parity-state and cluster-state schemes for optical\nquantum computing. Due to its greater difference from\nthe other two schemes, we did not include in the table\na scheme for quantum computing using \"cat\" states [7].\nCat states are in general more difficult to generate than\nBell states, so this makes a direct comparison of resource\nusage difficult. We note that on average 103 cat states\nare needed to create a telecorrector state in that scheme.\nThe loss threshold for the cat states is 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 , and\na threshold for depolarization was not specified in that\nwork.\nThus, our scheme for fault-tolerant parity-state quan-\n\n[1] E.

The parity scheme\nhas a higher error threshold than that found for coherent states, but also significantly larger resource requirements. Conversely, it is two orders of magnitude cheaper\nin resources than a cluster-state implementation, but also\nhas lower thresholds for both located and unlocated error\nrates. Together, these results suggest a necessary tradeoff between resources and achievable threshold, which indicates that the preferred encoding method in any experimental attempt to demonstrate optical quantum error\ncorrection will depend on the capabilities and limitations\nof the physical system and its components.\nIt is worth noting the general principle demonstrated\nhere, that concatenation can be used to tailor error correction to suit the relative error rates. In this case, some\nparity encoding is used to reduce the rate of failures due\nto non-deterministic gates to a level at which the remaining errors can be handled by the general error correction\ncode. However, the same principle could be applied to\nother errors. For example, a system with a very high loss\nrate in comparison with other errors could use concatenation with a dedicated loss-correction code [13] to allow\na higher threshold for loss at the cost of lower thresholds\nfor other errors.\n\n[4] A.
