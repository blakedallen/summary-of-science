It is known that there are specific examples of ergodic transformations on measure spaces for which the calculation of the outer measure of transformation invariant sets leads to a condition closely resembling Carath\u00e9odory's\ncondition for sets to be measurable.

We further show that the previously found specific examples of functions generating\nCarath\u00e9odory's definition fall into this family of transformations.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn the theory of measure and integration the definition given by Carath\u00e9odory\n[2] in 1914 is a crucial point in the relationship between an outer measure defined\non the set of all subsets of some given set, and a measure defined on some \u03c3-algebra\nof subsets for which additional convenient properties with respect to the measure\nhold ( [1, pp.101-103] or [4, pp.44-46]). Carath\u00e9odory's definition is that a subset\nA of some set X on which an outer measure \u03bc\u2217 is defined is called measurable if for\nall subsets B of X\n\u03bc\u2217 (B) = \u03bc\u2217 (B \u2229 A) + \u03bc\u2217 (B \u2229 Ac )\n(1)\nc\n(where from here on A denotes the complement of the set A).\nThe apparent lack of sufficient motivation for this definition has been commented\nupon by several mathematicians (see, for example, the discussion in [10]). In [10],\nhowever, it was shown that the definition of Carath\u00e9odory can be seen to naturally\narise by calculating the outer measure of the invariant sets of an irrational rotation\non the unit circle. Specifically, let T denote the set of complex numbers of modulus\n1, and note that an irrational rotation on T is an ergodic, but not weakly mixing,\ntransformation of the form z 7\u2192 \u03c1z. Letting \u03bc denote the usual Borel measure on\nT and \u03bc\u2217 be the associated outer measure, it was proven in [10] that if \u03c1 is an\nirrational rotation, A is a \u03c1-invariant subset of T, and there is a \u03b8 < 2 such that\nfor all arcs J of T,\n\u03bc\u2217 (A \u2229 J) + \u03bc\u2217 (Ac \u2229 J) \u2264 \u03b8\u03bc(J)\n(2)\nc\nthen either \u03bc\u2217 (A) = 0 or \u03bc\u2217 (A ) = 0. The simplest way for (2) to hold is for the set\nA to satisfy the Carath\u00e9odory condition, and in this sense, as motivated more fully\nin [10], the problem has motivated Carath\u00e9odory's definition of measurable sets.\nHaving shown that Carath\u00e9odor's definition can be generated by some transformations, we ask whether this is a coincidence, or whether this is a property of some\nlarge class of transformations for which such a connection makes sense.

KOELLER\n\nfor such a class should be sufficiently measure preserving and should take any test\nset of positive measure to any other. That is, the obvious class of transformations\nwould be the class of measure preserving transformations. In [10] it was conjectured\nthat the class may be the set of measure preserving ergodic transformations that\nare not strongly mixing. The later clarification due to the additional conjecture\nthat the transformation z 7\u2192 z 2 on T does not generate Carath\u00e9odory's definition\nin this way.\nIn [8] it was shown that a weakly, but not strongly, mixing ergodic transformation\ndue to Kakutani [6] generates Carath\u00e9odory's definition in the same sense as in [10],\nwhich appeared to support the conjecture in [10].\nIn this paper, however, we show that the family of transformations generating\nCarath\u00e9odory's definition in the sense described above is the more general class of\nall outer measure preserving ergodic transformations. We go on to show that each\nof the previously individually treated examples fall into this class, including the\ntransformation z 7\u2192 z 2 on T. We therefore answer the conjectures raised in [10]\nand find the desired large, heuristically expected class that can be considered to\ngenerate Carath\u00e9odory's definition.\n2. Definitions and the analytic principles of generating\nCarath\u00e9odory's definition\nThe idea in both the irrational rotations and Kakutani's transformation cases\nwas to take basic sets of measure estimation (in the former case arcs and in the\nlatter case dyadic intervals, see [9]), say J1 and J2 , of the same measure to find\nareas of density of the invariant set A and its complement Ac . It was shown that\nJ1 and J2 could be found such that\n\u03bc\u2217 (A \u2229 J1 ) > (1 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03bc(J1 ) and \u03bc\u2217 (Ac \u2229 J2 ) > (1 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03bc(J2 )\n\n(1)\n\nfor \u03b5 as small as desired. It was then shown (using the properties of the transformation in question) that either J1 or J2 could, under negative iterations of the\ntransformations, be 'rotated' onto the other (in the irrational rotations case not\nexactly onto the other, but as nearly as required). Using the measure preserving\nproperties of the transformations and (1), a contradiction to (2) would then arise.\nWe now extend these ideas to a general measure space (X, B, \u03bc) equipped with\nan outer measure preserving transformation T (together forming the dynamical\nsystem (X, B, \u03bc, T )).\nIn order to give more general results, we need first to establish what it means,\nin general, to generate Carath\u00e9odory's definition. We consider firstly the role of\nthe arcs or intervals in the previous works, which was to be a simple family of\nmeasurable sets from which, for any subset of A \u2282 X, an element could be found\nwhich locally represented the measure of A well. We call such a family, which is\nsomewhat like a topological subbasis, a measure basis. A Definition of a measure\nbasis is given below in Definition 2.2 after the concept of representing the measure\nof a set well is defined as a set of density in Definition 2.1.\nDefinition 2.1. - If (X, B, \u03bc) is a measure space, B \u2282 X has positive outer\nmeasure and \u03b5 > 0, then J \u2208 B is called a set of density to within \u03b5 for B if\n\u03bc\u2217 (B \u2229 J) > (1 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03bc(J).\nDefinition 2.2. - Let (X, B, \u03bc) be a measure space. A collection J \u2282 B will\nbe called a measure basis if for each pair of sets of positive measure A1 , A2 \u2282 X\nand each \u03b5 > 0 there exist sets J1 , J2 \u2208 J of equal measure such that Ji is a set of\ndensity to within \u03b5 for Ai for each i \u2208 {1, 2}.\n\n\fERGODIC TRANSFORMATIONS GENERATE CARATH\u00c9ODORY'S DEFINITION\n\n3\n\nRemark 2.3. -\n(1) We note that in any non-atomic measure space we will\nin fact be able to find a set in B, say J, for which \u03bc\u2217 (B \u2229 J) = \u03bc(J). We\ndo not dwell on this fact though, as we wish to allow for the selection of as\nsmall a measure basis as possible.\n(2) Note that every dynamical system will have at least one measure basis as\nB itself is a measure basis. Note also that the set of arcs in T and the set\nof dyadic intervals in [0, 1) as considered in [10] and [8] respectively are\nmeasure bases.\nHaving defined the basic objects to be considered in this work, we can now\ndefine how a transformation is considered to generate the Carath\u00e9odory definition\nanalogously to the interpretations of [8] and [10].\nDefinition 2.4. - Let T be a \u03bc-outer measure preserving transformation on\na measure space (X, B, \u03bc). That is, a transformation T : X \u2192 X such that\n\u03bc\u2217 (T \u22121 (A)) = \u03bc\u2217 (A) for all A \u2282 X. Furthermore, let J be a measure basis for\n(X, B, \u03bc). Then, if whenever A is a T -invariant subset of X for which there is a\n\u03b8 = \u03b8(A) < 2 such that for all J \u2208 J\n\u03bc\u2217 (A \u2229 J) + \u03bc\u2217 (Ac \u2229 J) \u2264 \u03b8\u03bc(J),\neither A or Ac is a set of outer measure zero, T is said to generate the Carath\u00e9odory\ndefinition of measurable sets relative to J or simply to generate Carath\u00e9odory's\ndefinition.\n3. Transformations generating Carath\u00e9odory's definition\nIt is under the above understanding of generating Carath\u00e9odory's definition that\nwe ask which transformations generate the definition. Clearly, for the concept of\ngeneration to make sense, any transformation capable of comparing any two sets\nin X should generate the definition. This is also, in fact, the case, as we show\nin our main theorem, Theorem 3.4, that all ergodic \u03bc-outer measure preserving\ntransformations generate the Carath\u00e9odory definition.\nWe immediately simplify the task of showing that a transformation generates\nCarath\u00e9odory's definition by reducing the conditions to be satisfied to properties\neasier to demonstrate.\nTheorem 3.1. - Suppose that (X, B, \u03bc, T ) is a dynamical system on a measurable\nspace and let J be a measure basis. Suppose that for any T -invariant B \u2282 X and\nfor any J \u2208 J , \u03bc\u2217 (B \u2229 K) \u2265 \u03bc\u2217 (B \u2229 J) for each K \u2208 J with \u03bc(K) = \u03bc(J). Then\nT generates the Carath\u00e9odory definition relative to J .\nProof. Let B be a T -invariant set for which there is a \u03b8 = \u03b8(B) < 2 for which\n\u03bc\u2217 (B \u2229 J) + \u03bc\u2217 (B c \u2229 J) < \u03b8\u03bc(J) for each J \u2208 J . Suppose that \u03bc\u2217 (B), \u03bc\u2217 (B c ) > 0\nand set \u03b5 = (2 \u2212 \u03b8)/2. Since J is a measure basis there exist J1 , J2 \u2208 J such that\n\u03bc\u2217 (B \u2229 J1 ) > (1 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03bc(J1 ) and \u03bc\u2217 (B c \u2229 J2 ) > (1 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03bc(J2 ),\nfor which, by hypothesis,\n\u03bc\u2217 (B \u2229 J2 ) \u2265 \u03bc\u2217 (B \u2229 J1 ) > (1 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03bc(J1 ) = (1 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03bc(J2 ).\nThat \u03bc\u2217 (B \u2229 J2 ) + \u03bc\u2217 (B c \u2229 J2 ) > 2(1 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03bc(J2 ) = \u03b8\u03bc(J2 ) follows. This contradiction shows that either \u03bc\u2217 (B) or \u03bc\u2217 (B c ) equals zero, and thus by definition that T\ngenerates Carath\u00e9odory's definition.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.2. - Clearly for any K \u2208 J we can use K as our original set to get\n\u03bc\u2217 (B \u2229 J) \u2265 \u03bc\u2217 (B \u2229 K) and thus have \u03bc\u2217 (B \u2229 K) = \u03bc\u2217 (B \u2229 J). However, while\n\n\f4\n\nAMOS N. KOELLER\n\nusing '=' or '\u2264' has little effect on the proof of this theorem, the phrasing allows\nfor a simpler proof of the main theorem.\nWe show the hypothesis of Theorem 3.1 and thus the main Theorem, Theorem\n3.4, by showing that B \u2229 K can be controllably transported to B \u2229 J.\nIn the irrational rotation case and the case of Kakutani's transformation, it was\npossible to track the elements of the measure basis, whose structure and connectedness are sufficiently preserved under the action of the transformations. This is\nof course not true of a general dynamical system. The difficulty in our main theorem, Theorem 3.4, is allowing for the first element chosen out of the measure basis\nto break up under iterations of the transformation and arrive in the second over a\nrange of differing 'times' (differing iterations of the transformation). Before proving\nTheorem 3.4 we require a simple lemma, whose proof can be found, for e.g., in [7]\nor [11].\nLemma 3.3. - Suppose that (X, B, \u03bc) is a measure space, B \u2282 X and {An }n\u2208N\nis a sequence of disjoint sets in B such that limn\u2192\u221e \u03bc(\u222a\u221e\ni=n Ai ) = 0. Then\n!\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\n[\n\u03bc\u2217 (Ai \u2229 B).\n(Ai \u2229 B) =\n\u03bc\u2217\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nTheorem 3.4. - Suppose T is an outer measure preserving ergodic transformation on the measure space (X, B, \u03bc). Then, for any measure basis, J , T generates\nthe Carath\u00e9odory definition relative to J .\nProof. We show that the hypotheses of Theorem 3.1 hold. Take J1 , J2 \u2208 J with\n\u03bc(J1 ) = \u03bc(J2 ). We construct splinters of J1 with respect to J2 as follows. Let\nA1 := T \u22121 (J1 ) \u2229 J2 \u2208 B\n\nand\n\nB1 := T \u22121 (J1 ) \u223c A1 = T \u22121 (J1 ) \u223c J2 \u2208 B,\n(where here, and in the remainder of the work, \u223c denotes set subtraction).

Then for any measure basis J , T generates\nthe Carath\u00e9odory definition relative to J if and only if T is ergodic.\nProof. That the ergodicity of T ensures that T generates Carath\u00e9odory's definition\nfollows from Theorem 3.4. Now suppose that T is not ergodic. Then there is a\nT -invariant set B \u2208 B such that 0 < \u03bc(B) < \u03bc(X). As B is measurable \u03bc(B \u2229\nJ) + \u03bc(B c \u2229 J) \u2264 \u03b8\u03bc(J) with \u03b8 = 1 for each J \u2208 J . However, \u03bc(B) 6= 0 and\n\u03bc(B c ) = \u03bc(X) \u2212 \u03bc(B) 6= 0. It follows that T does not generate Carath\u00e9odory's\ndefinition relative to J .\n\u0003\nSimilar results hold for families of transformations with ergodic countable subfamilies of transformations with the sacrifice that the transformations (at least of the\nergodic subfamily) must be invertible, which is not the case in Theorem 3.4. For\ndetails see [7].\nWe consider briefly some properties of the unusual requirement that a transformation be outer measure preserving.\n4. Outer measure preserving transformations\nThe properties of outer measure preserving transformations shown below are\nchosen on the basis of being sufficient to show that irrational rotations and Kakutani's transformation are outer measure preserving. We show first that measure\npreserving transformations with measurable images of measurable sets are outer\nmeasure preserving. This transfers the interest to images of measurable sets. In\nthis direction we make an adjustment to a theorem of Federer [3] from which it is\npossible to show the appropriate properties of the irrational rotations and Kakutani's transformation.\nTheorem 4.1. - If T is a measure preserving transformation on (X, B, \u03bc) such\nthat T (A) \u2208 B for each A \u2208 B, then T is outer measure preserving.\nProof. Let B \u2282 X. Then\n\u03bc\u2217 (B)\n\n= inf{\u03bc(A) : B \u2282 A, A \u2208 B}\n= inf{\u03bc(A) : T \u22121 (B) \u2282 T \u22121 (A), A \u2208 B}\n= inf{\u03bc(T \u22121 (A)) : T \u22121 (B) \u2282 T \u22121 (A), A \u2208 B}\n= inf{\u03bc(T \u22121 (A)) : T \u22121 (B) \u2282 T \u22121 (A), T \u22121 (A) \u2208 B}\n= \u03bc\u2217 (T \u22121 (B)).\n\u0003\n\n\fERGODIC TRANSFORMATIONS GENERATE CARATH\u00c9ODORY'S DEFINITION\n\n7\n\nThe result we adjust to show that the images of measurable sets are measurable\nunder the specific transformations we consider can be stated as in the following\ntheorem. A proof can be found in Federer [3].\nTheorem 4.2. - Let (X, B, \u03bd) and (Y, D, \u03bc) be two measure spaces. Let X be a\ncomplete separable metric space and Y be a Hausdorff space in which every closed\nset is \u03bc-measurable. Then, if f : X \u2192 Y is continuous the f -image of Borel sets is\n\u03bc-measurable.\nThe necessary adjustment to Theorem 4.2 required for our results is given below.\nCorollary 4.3. - Let (X, B, \u03bd) and (Y, D, \u03bc) be two measure spaces. Let X be a\ncomplete separable metric space and Y be a Hausdorff space in which every closed\nset is \u03bc-measurable. Then, if f : X \u2192 Y has a discrete set of discontinuities, the\nf -image of Borel sets is \u03bc-measurable.\nProof. Let D be the set of discontinuities. As D is discrete, there exists a countable\ncollection of disjoint balls {Bd = Brd (d) : d \u2208 D} where rd > 0 for each d \u2208 D. For\nany ball Bd in this collection let Cd,n = Bd \u223c Brd /n (d).\nFor each n \u2208 N and d \u2208 D the restriction of (X, B, \u03bd) to Cd,n is a measure\nspace on a complete separable metric space and f is continuous on Cd,n so that, by\nTheorem 4.2, f (B \u2229 Cd,n ) is \u03bc-measurable for each B \u2208 B. Additionally, since, for\neach d \u2208 D, f (d) is a point in Y it is closed and thus \u03bc-measurable.\nMoreover, for X1 = X \u223c \u222ad\u2208D Brd (d), the restriction of (X, B, \u03bd) to X1 is a\nmeasure space on a complete separable metric space on which f is continuous so\nthat, by Theorem 4.2, f (B \u2229 X1 ) is \u03bc-measurable for each B \u2208 B. Thus for each\nB\u2208B\n!\n!\n[\n[\nf (B) = f (B \u2229 X1 ) \u222a\nf B\u2229\nCd,n \u222a f (B \u2229 {d})\nd\u2208D\n\n=\n\nf (B \u2229 X1 ) \u222a\n\n[\n\nn\u2208N\n\nf (B \u2229 {d}) \u222a\n\nd\u2208D\n\n[ [\n\nf (B \u2229 Cd,n ),\n\nd\u2208D n\u2208N\n\nwhich is a countable union of \u03bc-measurable sets and thus \u03bc-measurable.\n\n\u0003\n\nFinally we show that both irrational rotations and Kakutani's transformation are\nergodic outer measure preserving transformations. We first give a precise definition\nof Kakutani's transformation.\nLet X := [0, 1) be equipped with the Lebesgue measure, \u03bc, and the usual Borel\nsets B to form the measure space (X, B, \u03bc). We define the primitive transformation\non X, \u03c8 : X \u2192 X by\n\u03c8(x) = x \u2212 1 +\n\n1\n1\n+ n+1 x \u2208 In\n2n\n2\n\n\u2032\nwhere In := [1\u22122\u2212n , 1\u22122n+1 ). Define A := \u222a\u221e\nn=0 I2n and let A be a set disjoint from\n\u2032\n\u2032\nX for which there exists a bijection \u03c4 : A \u2192 A . A is then the first (and in this case\nonly) floor of a so called tower construction (see [7] or [13] for further explanation).\nWe then extend the primitive dynamical system (X, B, \u03bc, T ) as follows: We define\nthe measure space (X\u0303, B\u0303, \u03bc\u0303) by\n\nX\u0303 := X \u222a A\u2032 ,\nB\u0303 := {B : B \u2282 X\u0303, B \u2229 X \u2208 B and \u03c4 \u22121 (B \u2229 A\u2032 ) \u2208 B}, and\n\u03bc\u0303(B) := \u03bc(B \u2229 X) + \u03bc(\u03c4 \u22121 (B \u2229 A\u2032 )), for all B \u2208 B\u0303.\n\n\f8\n\nAMOS N.

Since \u03c1 : T \u2192 T is continuous it follows directly from Theorem 4.2 that \u03c1 has\nmeasurable images of measurable sets and thus, by Theorem 4.1, is outer measure\npreserving. As mentioned previously, it was shown in [10] that \u03c1 is ergodic.\nIt has been shown in, for example [5],[6], and [7] that \u03c8 is ergodic and thus\nmeasure preserving. Furthermore, we see that the set of points D = {1 \u2212 1/2n :\nn \u2208 Z, n \u2265 0} is discrete in the usual measure space on [0, 1). It follows from the\ndefinition of \u03c8 that D is the set of discontinuities of \u03c8 and thus, from Corollary\n4.3, that \u03c8 is outer measure preserving.\nWe now show that if a primitive transformation is outer measure preserving,\nthen so to is any 1 level tower extension (indeed, the same is true for any tower\nextension, see [7], but is not here necessary to show).\nLet B \u2282 X\u0303. By the definition of a tower extension, (1), we see that \u03c8\u0303 \u22121 (B\u2229X) \u2282\nX\u0303 \u223c A and \u03c8\u0303 \u22121 (B \u2229 A\u2032 ) \u2282 A so that by the measurability of A\n \u0303 \u03c8\u0303 \u22121 ) = \u03bc \u0303\u2217 (\u03c8\u0303 \u22121 (B) \u2229 (X\u0303 \u223c A)) + \u03bc \u0303\u2217 (\u03c8\u0303 \u22121 (B) \u2229 A)\n\u03bc\u2217 (B)(\n=\n\n\u03bc \u0303\u2217 (\u03c8\u0303 \u22121 (B \u2229 X)) + \u03bc \u0303\u2217 (\u03c8\u0303 \u22121 (B \u2229 A\u2032 ))\n\nand\n\u03bc \u0303\u2217 (\u03c8\u0303 \u22121 (B \u2229 X)) = \u03bc \u0303\u2217 (\u03c4 (\u03c8 \u22121 (B \u2229 X) \u2229 A)) + \u03bc\u2217 (\u03c8 \u22121 (B \u2229 X) \u223c A).\nBy definition \u03bc \u0303\u2217 (\u03c4 (\u03c8 \u22121 (B \u2229 X) \u2229 A)) = \u03bc\u2217 (\u03c8 \u22121 (B \u2229 X) \u2229 A)) so that, since \u03c8 is\nouter measure preserving and A is measurable,\n\u03bc \u0303\u2217 (\u03c8\u0303 \u22121 (B \u2229 X)) =\n=\n\n\u03bc\u2217 (\u03c8 \u22121 (B \u2229 X) \u2229 A)) + \u03bc\u2217 (\u03c8 \u22121 (B \u2229 X) \u223c A)\n\u03bc\u2217 (\u03c8 \u22121 (B \u2229 X)) = \u03bc\u2217 (B \u2229 X).\n\nAlso by definition \u03bc \u0303\u2217 (\u03c8\u0303 \u22121 (B \u2229 A\u2032 )) = \u03bc\u2217 (\u03c4 \u22121 (B \u2229 A\u2032 )) = \u03bc\u2217 (B \u2229 A\u2032 ). Thus\n\u03bc\u2217 (\u03c8\u0303 \u22121 (B)) = \u03bc\u2217 (B \u2229 X) + \u03bc\u2217 (B \u2229 A\u2032 ) = \u03bc\u2217 (B),\nand therefore \u03c8\u0303 is outer measure preserving. The proof is completed by noting that\nit is known that \u03c8\u0303 is ergodic (see [5], [6] or [7]).\n\u0003\nRemark 4.5. - Note that the ergodic (and thus measure preserving) transformation on the unit circle, z 7\u2192 z 2 is a continuous function. It follows that the\nimages of measurable sets under this transformation are measurable, and thus that\nthe transformation is outer measure preserving. Theorem 3.4 then shows that this\ntransformation does indeed generate the Carath\u00e9odory definition. The difference\nhere from the analysis in [10] is that, in [10], the structure of an arc needed to\nbe preserved under negative iterations of the transformation, which is not the case\nfor z 7\u2192 z 2 , whereas in the present analysis, by allowing splinters to develop, such\nstructure preservation is not necessary.\nReferences\n[1] R.
