In some way similarly to high-Tc cuprates, the borocarbides\nhave a layered crystal structure, even if band-structure calculations have shown\nthe presence of a three-dimensional electronic structure (see Ref. [1] for a short\noverview of selected properties). Initially, a conventional BCS description of the\nsuperconducting properties in these materials has been supported by many of the\nexperimental and theoretical results. More recently some particular features of the\nelectronic specific heat (as a function of temperature and magnetic field) and of the\nupper critical field in the non-magnetic borocarbides LuNi2 B2 C and YNi2 B2 C have\nbeen interpreted as signs of an unconventional pairing, possibly of d-wave type 2 .\nOn the other hand, Shulga et al. have recently explained the positive curvature\nof the upper critical field of YNi2 B2 C as a function of the temperature near Tc ,\nits magnitude and shape in the framework of s-wave Migdal-Eliashberg theory by\n\n\f35\nResistivity (\u03bc\u03a9 cm)\n\n4\n\nResistivity (\u03bc\u03a9 cm)\n\n30\n25\n20\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nYNi2B2C\nTc = 15.5 K\n\u2206 Tc=0.5 K\n\nTemperature (K)\n\n15\n10\n\nexperimental data\nBloch-Gr\u00fcneisen fit\n\n5\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nFigure 1: A few points of the typical resistivity of one of our YNi2 B2 C single crystals (open circles)\nand the fit using the Bloch-Gr\u00fcneisen model (solid line). The inset shows the low temperature\npart of the resistivity and the fit with all the measured points.\n\nconsidering the presence of two bands, one of them being more deeply involved in\nthe transport properties of the compound 3 .\nIn the present work we demonstrate the complete agreement of the experimental\nresistivity data obtained in YNi2 B2 C with the predictions of the classic singleband theory for the electron-phonon (e-p) interaction (Bloch-Gr\u00fcneisen theory). We\nobtain a value of the transport e-p coupling constant that well agrees with previous\nexperimental and theoretical results. The transport e-p spectral function \u03b12tr F (\u03a9)\nis also obtained by the fit of the experimental data in the whole temperature range\nand used for the calculation of the normalized tunneling conductance by directly\nsolving the real-axis Eliashberg equations.\n2\n\nExperiment\n\nHigh-quality YNi2 B2 C single crystals were grown by using the rf - zone melting\nprocess 4 . The critical temperature of the crystals, measured by AC susceptibility\nand perfectly confirmed by resistivity measurements, is Tc = 15.5 K with \u2206Tc (10 \u2212\n90%) = 0.5 K. The imaginary part of the susceptibility shows a single, very high\nand narrow peak at T \u2248 Tc which confirms the purity and crystallographic quality\nof the samples.\nWe measured the resistivity of these crystals as a function of the temperature,\non cooling from 300 K down to 4.2 K, by using the AC version of the standard fourprobe technique. The current leads were directly soldered to the opposite sides of\nthe samples, which have parallelepipedal shape. The voltage leads, made from very\nthin gold wires, were glued with a conducting paste to the surface of the crystals.\nWe improved the sensitivity of the measurement by injecting in the crystals an AC\ncurrent of typically 10 mA at 133 and detecting the voltage by the standard lockin technique. Due to a very slow cooling-down procedure, we were able to collect\n\n\f0.05\n0.04\n0.03\n\n(\u03c1 - \u03c1FIT ) / \u03c1\n\n0.02\n0.01\n0.00\n-0.01\n-0.02\n-0.03\n-0.04\n-0.05\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nFigure 2: The relative deviations (\u03c1\u2212\u03c1FIT )/\u03c1 of the experimental data from the fit.\n\nnearly three thousand resistivity values for every curve between 4.2 and 300 K.\nIn Figure 1 the resistivity \u03c1(T ) of one of the YNi2 B2 C crystals is shown (open\ncircles). For clarity, only a reduced number of points is reported. In the inset of the\nsame figure we show an enlargement of the low-temperature part of the resistivity\ncurve that contains all the measured points at T < 30 K (open circles).\nThe resistivity of Fig. 1 shows a perfect Bloch-Gr\u00fcneisen (BG) behavior that\nhas already been observed in previous experiments 5 . The small residual value of\nthe resistivity \u03c1(0)= 3 \u03bc\u03a9*cm and its perfectly linear high-temperature part (with\na slope d\u03c1/dT = 0.12 \u03bc\u03a9*cm/K) indicate the high quality and low impurity content\nof the samples. Quite similar results were obtained in various YNi2 B2 C samples.\n3\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe resistivity of a normal Fermi-liquid metal follows the well known Matthiessen's\nrule: \u03c1(T )=\u03c10 +\u03c1ph (T ), where \u03c10 and \u03c1ph (T ) are the residual and the phonon resistivities, respectively.\nAccording to the BG theory, the high-temperature part of the \u03c1ph (T ) shows a\nlinear behavior given by the following expression:\n\u03c1ph (T ) = (2\u03c0\u03b50 kB /~\u03c9p2 )\u03bbtr T\n\nR\u221e\nwhere \u03c9p is the plasma frequency, \u03bbtr =2 0 [\u03b12tr F (\u03a9)/\u03a9]d\u03a9 is the transport e-p coupling constant, and \u03b12tr F (\u03a9) is the transport e-p spectral function. Once known the\nexperimental value of the plasma energy ~\u03c9p and the temperature coefficient of the\nlinear part of the resistivity at T>100 K (see Fig. 1), we can determine the transport\ncoupling constant \u03bbtr = (~\u03c9p2 /2\u03c0\u03b50 kB )d\u03c1ph /dT = (~\u03c9p2 /2\u03c0\u03b50 kB )d\u03c1/dT . The values\n\u03c9p = 4.25 eV determined in Ref. [6] by reflectance and EELS measurements and\nd\u03c1/dT = 0.12 \u03bc\u03a9*cm/K from Fig. 1 lead to the result \u03bbtr = 0.53.\nFull information on the e-p coupling in YNi2 B2 C can be obtained by fitting the\nresistivity of Fig. 1 in the whole temperature range.

Actually, as a first\napproximation, for the \u03b12tr F (\u03a9) we use the phonon spectral density G(\u03a9) obtained\nin inelastic neutron scattering experiments 7 multiplied by a two-step weighting\nfunction, whose constant values for \u03a9 < 37.5 meV and 37.5 < \u03a9 < 70 meV are to be\ndetermined by the fit. These energy ranges are chosen because they correspond to\nthe two most-distinguishable structures of the G(\u03a9) which shows peaks at about 20\nand 50 meV and a value close to zero just at 37.5 meV. We neglected in the fit the\npresence of high energy phonons at about 100 meV.\nThe results of the fit are shown as a solid line in Fig. 1. The experimental \u03c1(T )\nis perfectly fitted by the theoretical BG curve in the whole temperature range. Fig. 2\nshows the relative deviations of the experimental curve from the fit (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1FIT )/\u03c1 as\nfunction of temperature. They never exceed \u00b15%.\nFig. 3 shows the spectral function \u03b12tr F (\u03a9) obtained as the product of the G(\u03a9)\nby the two-step weighting function \u03b12tr determined from the fit. The latter function\nis shown in the inset of Fig. 3. Of course, the \u03bbtr calculated from the \u03b12tr F (\u03a9)\nperfectly coincides with the value previously obtained from the linear part of \u03c1(T ).\nIt is well known that, to a first approximation, \u03bbtr \u2248 \u03bb, where \u03bb is the e-p\ncoupling factor involved in the BCS coupling of the Cooper's pairs. In the hypothesis\nof an e-p coupling origin of the superconductivity in YNi2 B2 C we calculate the\nquasiparticle density of states in this compound in both s- and d-wave symmetry by\nsolving in direct way the real-axis Eliashberg equations for the strong e-p coupling 8\nand using as \u03b12tr F (\u03a9) the function shown in Fig. 3.\nFig. 4 shows the SIN tunneling conductances in s- and d-wave symmetry calculated at 4.2 K from the density of states (solid and dash lines, respectively).

This fact is consistent with the conventional\nrelation between \u03bb and \u03bbtr . From the curves of Fig. 4 and the tunneling experimental data in STM configuration 10,11 it is very difficult to determine the possible\nsymmetry of the order parameter in YNi2 B2 C due to the appreciable broadening\nof the SIN data.\nA more clear indication can be obtained by the comparison of the calculated\nSIS tunneling conductance with the break-junction experimental data present in\nliterature. This comparison is shown in Fig. 5 where the theoretical SIS curves\nat 4 K determined from the solution of Eliashberg equation for pure d-wave (dash\nline), pure s-wave (dot line) and s-wave plus magnetic impurities in quasi nonunitary limit 12 (solid line) are presented together with the break-junction data of\nEkino et al 9 (inset). The s-wave curve in presence of a small amount of magnetic\nimpurities (for details see the caption of the figure and Ref. [12]) reproduces all the\nmain features of the experimental data including the well pronounced dip at about\ntwice the energy of the gap. On the other hand, the d-wave tunneling conductance\nis quite different from the experimental curve. These results suggest a possible swave symmetry (or, at least, a dominant s-wave component) in YNi2 B2 C and give\nevidence for the essential role played by the electron-phonon coupling in the pairing\nmechanism in this compound.\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have demonstrated that the resistivity of YNi2 B2 C has a temperature dependence perfectly described by the standard BG theory for the e-p coupling in conventional metals. The value of \u03bbtr here determined from the resistivity is representative\nof an intermediate e-p coupling strength and is consistent with the value used in\nRef.
