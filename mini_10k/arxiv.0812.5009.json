It is the basis of\na lot of quantum protocols, such as quantum computation [1], quantum cryptography [2], quantum teleportation [3], quantum dense coding [4] and so on. It has\nbeen an important physical resource. Recently, many efforts have been made on the quantification of the resource\n[5,6,7,8], however, the good understanding is only limited\nin low-dimensional systems. The quantification of entanglement for higher dimensional systems and multipartite\nquantum systems remains to be an open question.\nSince the remarkable concurrence was presented [5],\nit has been shown to be a useful entanglement measure\nfor the systems of qubit. More interestingly, based on\nthe concurrence, Valerie Coffman et al [9] introduced the\nso called residual entanglement for tripartite systems of\nqubits. The residual entanglement is independent on the\npermutation of the qubits, hence can be employed to\nmeasure genuine three-party entanglement, i.e. the tripartite entanglement, which opens the path to studying\nmultipartite entanglement. Based on the motivation of\ngeneralizing the definition of the residual entanglement\nto higher dimensional systems and multipartite quantum\nsystems, Alexander Wong et al [10] introduced the definition of the n-tangle for n qubits with n even, however,\nthe n-tangle itself is not a measure of the n-partite entanglement. Later, hyperdeterminant in Ref. [11] has\nbeen shown to be an entanglement monotone and represent the genuine multipartite entanglement. However,\nit is easy to find that the hyperdeterminant for higher\ndimensional systems and multipartite system can not be\nexplicitly given conveniently. In particular, so far the\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: hssong@dlut.edu.cn\n\nhyperdeterminant as an entanglement measure has not\nbeen able to be extended to mixed systems. Furthermore, a new method by constructing N -qubit entanglement monotones was introduced by Andreas Osterloh et\nal [12] for pure states to measure the n-partite entanglement, however, it is only confined to the systems of\nqubits and seems to be very difficult to extend to the\ncase of mixed states analogously to Ref. [11].\nIn this paper, we introduce a new approach to generalize the residual entanglement for tripartite systems\nof qubits to the tripartite systems in higher dimension.\nOne knows that the key to obtaining the explicit \u03c4ABC\nin Ref. [9] is the analytic expression of the concurrence\nin mixed systems of qubits. However, so far no one has\nbeen able to obtain an analytic expression of concurrence\n(or concurrence vector) for higher dimensional mixed systems, which means that the expectable results for higher\ndimensional systems seems not to be obtained from the\nsimilar method to that in Ref. [9]. Hence, we provide\nan intuitive mathematical formulation to generalize the\nresidual entanglement according to the tensor treatment\nof tripartite pure states presented in Ref. [13]. A distinct\ncharacteristic of the present generalization is that the\nformulation for higher dimensional systems is invariant\nunder permutation of the subsystems (i.e. the qudits),\nhence can be employed as a criterion to test existence of\nthe genuine tripartite entanglement (also called tripartite entanglement for convenience in the paper). Furthermore, the formulation for pure states can be conveniently\nextended to the case of mixed states by utilizing the kronecker product approximate technique [14,15]. However,\nit should be noted that the formulation is not an entanglement measure except that for tripartite systems of\nqubits due to the variance under local unitary operations.\nAs applications, we give the analytic approximation of\nthe criterion for weakly mixed tripartite quantum states\n(quasi pure states) and consider the existence of tripartite\nentanglement of some quasi pure states, which shows that\nour criterion can be conveniently applied in these cases.\n\n\f2\nThe paper is organized as follows. Firstly, we give the\nintuitive generalization of the residual entanglement for\npure states; secondly, we extend it to mixed states and\ndiscuss the existence of tripartite entanglement of some\nquasi pure states; the conclusions are drawn in the end.\n\nII.\n\nEXISTENCE CRITERION OF TRIPARTITE\nENTANGLEMENT FOR PURE STATES\n\na\n\n\u221a\ndet R = |d1 \u2212 2d2 + 4d3 | ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere a constant factor is neglected and the element Rij\nof the 2 \u00d7 2 matrix R is defined by\nX\nRij =\naklj a\u2217mni \u01ebmp \u01ebnq a\u2217pqr astr \u01ebsk \u01ebtl ,\n(2)\nwith the sum being over all the repeated indices, \u01eb01 =\n\u2212\u01eb10 = 1 and \u01eb00 = \u2212\u01eb11 = 1;\nd1 = a2000 a2111 + a2001 a2110 + a2010 a2101 + a2100 a2011 ;\nd2 = a000 a111 a011 a100 + a000 a111 a101 a010\n+a000 a111 a110 a001 + a011 a100 a101 a010\n+a011 a100 a110 a001 + a101 a010 a110 a001 ;\nd3 = a000 a110 a101 a011 + a111 a001 a010 a100 .\n\n(3)\n\nWhat's more, the a terms in above equations are the\ncoefficients in the standard basis defined by |\u03c8ABC i =\nP1\ni,j,k=0 aijk |ijkiABC . As mentioned in Ref. [9], the expression of \u03c4 (|\u03c8ABC i) can be mentally pictured by imagining the eight coefficients aijk attached to the corners\nof a cube. The picture yields that \u03c4 is invariant under permutations of the qubits, because a permutation\nof qubits corresponds to a reflection or rotation of the\ncube. It happens that the picture is consistent to the\ntensor cube introduced in Ref. [13]. In other words, a\ntensor cube of |\u03c8ABC i corresponds to a tripartite entanglement measure \u03c4 (|\u03c8ABC i). For convenience, we employ\n2\nf (|\u03c8ABC i) = |\u03c4 (|\u03c8ABC i)| to measure tripartite entanglement, which is equivalent to \u03c4 (|\u03c8ABC i) from the viewpoint of entanglement measure. Obviously, f (|\u03c8ABC i)\nhas the same properties to \u03c4 (|\u03c8ABC i).\nAccording to Ref. [13], a tripartite pure state in\nany dimension can be regarded as the tensor grid\nwhich includes tensor cubes. E.g. let |\u03c6ABC i =\nP2\nP1\nk=0 aijk |ijkiABC , the tensor grid of |\u03c6ABC i can\ni,j=0\nbe pictured as figure 1, which includes three tensor cubes.\nIn this sense, one can draw a conclusion that tensor cube\nis the unit of tensor grid. Since every tensor cube in a\n\n002\n\na\n\n011\n\n010\n\n012\n\na\n\na101\n\n100\n\na110\n\na\n\n001\n\na\n\na\n\nThe residual entanglement for tripartite systems of\nqubits or \u03c4ABC (i.e. the tripartite entanglement measure) is given by\n\u03c4 (|\u03c8ABC i) =\n\na\n\n000\n\na102\na\n\na111\n\n112\n\nFIG. 1: The tensor grid of the coefficients of a tripartite pure\nstate in 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 dimension.\n\ntensor grid can be considered as an non-normalized tripartite pure state of qubits, one can get that every unit\ncorresponds to the tripartite entanglement measure of\nthe non-normalized pure state. Namely, the tensor cube\ncorresponds to the minimal unit of describing the tripartite entanglement. Therefore, whether there exist some\ngenuine tripartite entanglement can be determined by all\nthe minimal units.\nTheorem 1:-For any a tripartite pure state |\u03a8i which\nincludes M minimal units mentioned above, let the\nthe non-normalized tripartite pure state of qubits corresponding to the ith unit be denoted by |\u03c6i i, then the\ncorresponding tripartite entanglement can be given by\nf (|\u03c6i i). Define\nv\nuM\nuX\n4\nf (|\u03c6i i),\nF (|\u03a8i) = t\n\n(4)\n\ni=1\n\nfor the state |\u03a8i, then if there does not exist genuine\ntripartite entanglement in |\u03a8i, F (|\u03a8i) = 0.\nProof. It is obvious that F (|\u03a8i) = 0 means that\nf (|\u03c6i i) = 0 holds for all \u03c6i , vice versa. Since the tensor cube corresponds to the minimal unit of describing\nthe tripartite entanglement, F (|\u03a8i) = 0 shows that there\ndoes not exist genuine three-party entanglement in |\u03a8i.\nThat is to say, F (|\u03a8i) can effectively test the existence of\ntripartite entanglement in |\u03a8i. Furthermore, a permutation of qudits corresponds to a reflection or rotation of\nthe tensor grid, which is similar to that in Ref. [9], hence\nall the tensor cubes in the tensor grid are invariant except the relative positions in the grid. Namely, F (|\u03a8i) is\ninvariant under permutations of the qudits.\nConsidering the matrix notation of |\u03a8i\n=\nPn1 \u22121 Pn2 \u22121 Pn3 \u22121\na\n|ijki,\nF\n(|\u03a8i)\ncan\nbe\nexijk\ni=0\nj=0\nk=0\n\n\f3\nentries mij , defined in Cd1 \u2297 Cd2 , M\u0303 can be defined [16]\nby\n\npressed as the function of |\u03a8i, i.e.\nv\nu N1 N2 N3\nuX X X\n4\nf ((s\u03b1 \u2297 s\u03b2 \u2297 s\u03b3 ) |\u03a8i),\nF (|\u03a8i) = t\n\u03b1=1 \u03b2=1 \u03b3=1\n\nn (n \u22121)\n\nwhere Np = p 2p\nwith p = 1, 2, 3; sq , q = \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3,\ndenotes 2 \u00d7 np matrix with p corresponding to q.

A distinct characteristic of the present generalization is that the formulation for higher dimensional systems is invariant under permutation of the qudits. When\nthe formulation is reduced to tripartite systems of qubits,\nthere exists an exponent 12 different from the original\none, but the change of exponent provides convenience for\nthe generalization to mixed states.

However, because the dimension of A\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 is much higher than\nthat corresponding to bipartite entanglement, it seems\nto be a bit difficult to directly apply to test the existence of tripartite entanglement of a general quantum\nmixed state. Fortunately, for the weakly mixed states,\ni.e. quasi pure states, one can find that our criterion can\nbe conveniently applied and is even a sufficient condition\nfor the existence of tripartite entanglement. In particular, our criterion can provide an analytic approximation.\nSince the 3-tangle is an entanglement measure, Fa (\u03c1) is\nnot only an existence criterion, but also an effective tripartite entanglement indicator. Even though there exist\nsome questions left open, the intuitive mathematical formulation of tripartite entanglement and the convenient\nextension to mixed states will play an important role in\nthe further understanding of multipartite entanglement\nmeasure.\n\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, under Grant No. 60472017.\n\n[12] Andreas Osterloh, Jens Siewert, Phys.
