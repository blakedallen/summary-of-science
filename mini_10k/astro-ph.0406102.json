They are\nobserved frequently in binary systems, with normal stellar\ncompanions, as cataclysmic variable stars and, less often,\nwith compact object companions, WDCO systems. Many of\nthese systems are produced naturally in binary star evolution and, as a consequence, have circular orbits. However, it\nis also possible to form eccentric, WDCO binaries following\nstellar capture or exchange in a dense stellar environment.\nIn the present paper, we do not consider the formation of\nsuch binaries in detail; we list some possible formation mechanisms, but our detailed considerations are restricted to the\nevolution of such systems after they form.\nThere are three possible types of WDCO systems.\nPerhaps the most common are double degenerates (e.g.\n\n\u22c6\n\nyasser@caltech.edu\n\nMaxted et al. 2002), which have been observed to have periods as short as \u223c 5 min (Ramsay et al. 2002). A second\nclass is white dwarf-neutron star binaries, of which there\nare over 50 known or suspected (Lorimer 2001), with orbital periods as short as 3 hr (Edwards & Bailes 2000). The\nthird class are white dwarf-black hole binaries. For black hole\ncompanions in the stellar mass range, there are no known\nexamples\u2013they would be extremely hard to find. There is,\nhowever, growing theoretical evidence for, and observational\nevidence consistent with, the existence of intermediate mass\nblack holes (IMBHs). X-ray observations of nearby galaxies\nhint at the possibility of a large population of black holes in\nthe \u223c 102 \u2013104 M\u2299 mass range (Colbert & Mushotzky 1999;\nColbert & Ptak 2002). The interpretation of these observations is the source of some debate, but accreting IMBHs are\ncertainly a plausible explanation. These IMBHs may have\nbeen formed in the early universe from 102 \u2013103 M\u2299 stars\n(Bromm et al. 1999). Also, recent dynamical simulations of\ndense stellar clusters have demonstrated that runaway collisions can lead rapidly to the formation of black holes with\n\n\f2\n\nYasser Rathore, Roger D. Blandford and Avery E. Broderick\n\nmasses in the \u223c 102 \u2013103 M\u2299 range (Portegies Zwart et al.\n2004). More generally, the population of IMBHs could span\nthe entire interval between stellar and massive black holes\n(\u223c 102 \u2013106 M\u2299 ). They could either tidally capture white\ndwarfs from the field (Fabian et al. 1975; Press & Teukolsky\n1977), or participate in three-body processes in stellar clusters and end up in bound orbits with white dwarf companions (Hills 1977).\nThe tidal capture mechanism is simple in principle.\nWhen the radius of periastron is no more than a few times\nthe Roche limit, the normal modes of the white dwarf can\nbe excited non-resonantly. On egress, the energy of the\noscillation is taken out of the orbit, which can become\nbound. The energy transfer need be no more than \u223c(30\u2013\n100 km s\u22121 )2 \u2261 1013\u221214 erg g\u22121 \u2261 10\u2013100 eV per nucleon for\ncapture to ensue. Subsequent periastron passages can lead\nto additional mode excitation and the possibility of heating\nthe star if the oscillation energy is thermalised. For a black\nhole companion, this mechanism requires that the Roche\nlimit lie not too far inside the event horizon, which sets an\nupper limit of \u223c 106 M\u2299 on the black hole mass. (When the\nblack hole mass exceeds \u223c 3 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 , it turns out that\ngravitational bremsstrahlung is more important than tidal\ncapture and contributes a larger capture cross-section.)\nWhatever their detailed nature and origin, WDCO binaries evolve dynamically under the action of gravitational\nradiation. The orbital periods and eccentricities will decrease until the former reaches the Roche period, \u223c 10\u2212100 s\ndepending upon mass, when the star will be torn apart\nby tidal forces. During inspiral, a WDCO system will pass\nthrough a series of resonances between harmonics of the orbital frequency and the white dwarf normal mode eigenfrequencies. Typically, the system will spend many orbits\nnear each resonance, and consecutive resonances for a given\nmode will be separated by a much larger number of orbits\nassociated with the gravitational inspiral time-scale. Passage\nthrough a sequence of such resonances will result in transfer\nof energy from the orbit to the oscillations and may drive\nthe amplitudes of the oscillations non-linear, with possibly\nobservable consequences.\nIf the energy transfer from the orbit to the stellar oscillation is as large as \u223c 10 keV per nucleon and the mode\nenergy is thermalised, then it is possible to detonate the\nstar, releasing more nuclear energy (\u223c 1 MeV per nucleon)\nthan the gravitational binding energy (\u223c 0.1\u20130.3 MeV per\nnucleon). Typically, for a black hole companion, the orbital\nbinding energy will be greater than the nuclear energy released, so most of the ejecta will be trapped. However, for\na white dwarf or neutron star companion, the ejecta can\nbecome unbound.\nWe note that WDCO binaries also constitute one of\nthe prime potential sources for LISA (e.g. Finn & Thorne\n2000). The considerations presented below may be relevant\nto gravitational wave observations of these systems.\nIn order to understand how much energy is transferred\nfrom the orbit to the white dwarf during inspiral, it is necessary to consider the evolution of the system after it has lost\nmuch of its initial eccentricity. We present a general formalism for handling tidal resonances in WDCO binaries in the\nlinear normal mode approximation. We restrict ourselves to\nnon-rotating stars because white dwarfs are observed generally to be slowly rotating, and they are not expected to\n\nmaintain corotation during inspiral (c.f. Bildsten & Cutler\n1992). However, this needs further investigation. In addition,\nwe mostly confine our attention to the l = m = 2 f -mode\nbecause it is expected to be the dominantly excited one.\nNonetheless, our formalism may be applied to other modes\nas well. Of particular interest may be g-modes, as these have\nlower frequencies than the f -modes, and can therefore be excited at fundamental resonance in circular orbits before tidal\ndisruption.\nWe begin with a description of the general formalism\nin \u00a72. This includes a brief description of the resonant excitation of a simple harmonic oscillator (\u00a72.1), a summary of\nthe structure and normal modes of cold white dwarfs (\u00a72.2),\nan overview of gravitational radiation reaction (\u00a72.3), and\nour formalism for tidal excitation (\u00a72.4). In \u00a73, we discuss\nsome physical aspects of the dynamical problem, including\nmode damping and time-scales. We also discuss the physical\nregimes where various effects are important. In \u00a74, we apply\nthe general formalism to calculate the energy transfer for a\nresonance in an eccentric orbit, ignoring back reaction. In\n\u00a75, we discuss the regime where this result is expected to be\nvalid, and describe the qualitative effects of back reaction.\nThis is followed by a description of the long term evolution of\nWDCO binaries in the absence of back reaction. We present\nour conclusions in \u00a76.\n2\n\nGENERAL FORMALISM\n\n2.1\n\nSimple harmonic oscillator\n\nConsider an undamped simple harmonic oscillator with natural frequency \u03c90 and displacement x(t) subject to an external force per unit mass F (t). The equation of motion,\n\u1e8d + \u03c902 x = F (t) ,\n\n(1)\n\ncan be easily solved to get\n\u1e8b(t) = R [\u03b6(t)] ,\n1\nx(t) =\nI [\u03b6(t)] ,\n\u03c90\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nwhere\n\u03b6(t) = \u03b60 ei\u03c90 t + \u03b61 (t) ,\n\n(4)\n\nand\n\u03b61 (t) \u2261 ei\u03c90 t\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n\u2032\n\ndt\u2032 e\u2212i\u03c90 t F (t\u2032 ) .\n\n(5)\n\nt0\n\nIt follows from the expressions for x and \u1e8b in terms of \u03b6 that\nthe total energy per unit mass of the oscillator as a function\nof time is given by\n1\n|\u03b6(t)|2 .\n(6)\n2\nLet the external force per unit mass now be of the form\n\nE(t) =\n\nF (t) = F0 (t) cos [\u03c6(t)] ,\nwith the amplitude F0 and frequency \u03c6\u0307 being slowly varying functions of time, and \u03c6\u0308 > 0. Resonance occurs when the\nrelative phase of the driver and the oscillator becomes stationary. This gives us the condition \u03c6\u0307(t) = \u03c90 . We assume\nthat there is only one passage through resonance, and since\n\n\fResonant Excitation of White Dwarf Oscillations in Compact Object Binaries: 1. The No Back Reaction Approxim\nthere will be little average energy transfer away from resonance, we need only consider the form of the forcing function\nnear resonance. Let tR be the time when the resonance condition is satisfied, and expand the driver in a Taylor series\naround this point:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03c42\nF (tR + \u03c4 ) \u2243 F0 (tR ) cos \u03c6(tR ) + \u03c90 \u03c4 + \u03c6\u0308(tR )\n.\n(7)\n2\n(Since the amplitude varies slowly with time, to lowest order, we can take the amplitude as constant through the resonance.)

The requirement that the\nfrequency of the driver is varying slowly therefore implies\n\u03b1 \u226a 1. In other words, the driver can be considered harmonic with a well-defined frequency over several periods of\nthe oscillator. We can also view \u03b1 as a measure of the phase\n\"drift\"\u2013i.e. a measure of how fast the driver accumulates\nadditional phase. With this interpretation, it is easy to see\nthat the time spent near resonance is given by (\u03b1\u03c902 )\u22121/2 ,\napproximately.\nThe problem of solving for the motion of the oscillator is now mathematically similar to the theory of Fresnel\ndiffraction, and the solution can be expressed in terms of\nFresnel integrals. We relegate the detailed calculation to Appendix A and simply summarise the result:\n(\nFR i\u03c90 \u03c4\n\u03b61 =\ne\nI1 (\u03c4 ) exp (i\u03c6R )\n2\n\u0013\u0015 )\n\u0014 \u0012\n2\n,\n+ I2 (\u03c4 ) exp \u2212i \u03c6R \u2212\n\u03b1\nwhere I1 and I2 are given by expressions involving Fresnel\nintegrals. The time-averaged energy per unit mass changes\nasymptotically by\ns\n!\n\u03c0FR2\nE0\n1+2\ncos \u03c8 ,\n(9)\n\u2206E =\n4\u03b1\u03c902\n\u03c0FR2 /4\u03b1\u03c902\nwhere E0 = |\u03b60 |2 /2 is the initial energy, and \u03c8 is an initial\nphase. Qualitatively, the velocity is in quadrature with the\nforce well away from resonance, but the relative phase of the\ntwo becomes approximately stationary near resonance for a\ntime interval \u223c (\u03b1\u03c902 )\u22121/2 , and there is a velocity change\n\u223c FR (\u03b1\u03c902 )\u22121/2 . The presence of the \u03c8 dependent term reflects the fact that the oscillator may gain or lose energy,\ndepending upon its initial energy and the relative phasing\nwith the driver near resonance. If we perform an ensemble\naverage over initial phases (assuming a uniform distribution), we find that the average energy transfer is given by\n\u03b5 \u2261 h\u2206Ei =\n\n\u03c0FR2\n.\n4\u03b1\u03c902\n\n(10)\n\nFrom (9) it is then obvious that, for E0 \u226a \u03b5, the initial\n\nphase is unimportant and the actual energy transfer will be\nvery close to the average. The possibility of negative energy\ntransfer only exists when\nE0 >\n\n\u03b5\n,\n4C 2\n\nwhere C \u2261 cos \u03c8. Note that, since the energy of the oscillator\ncannot be negative, it must be true that \u2206E > \u2212E0 . It can\nbe shown that (9) complies with this constraint.\nSimple, linear damping is conventionally treated by\nadding a term 2\u03b3 \u1e8b to the left side of (1). When \u03b3 \u226a\n(\u03b1\u03c902 )1/2 , the development of the oscillation will be uninfluenced by damping, although the energy of the oscillation will\nbe converted steadily into heat. However, when the damping\nis effective on the time-scale of energy transfer, the amplitude of the oscillation will be reduced. Nonetheless, it can\nbe shown that the energy that appears ultimately as heat is\nstill given by (9), independent of \u03b3, as long as \u03b3 \u226a \u03c90 (see,\nfor example, Landau & Lifshitz 1969).\n\n2.2\n\nWhite dwarf oscillations\n\nIn this paper, we confine our attention to homogeneous,\nnon-rotating white dwarfs where the pressure is contributed\nsolely by cold, degenerate electrons. Thermal corrections,\nCoulomb effects, as well as compositional discontinuities are\nignored. The relevant equations of stellar structure are described in Kippenhahn & Weigert (1990). We consider three\ncases with masses 0.6, 1.0, 1.4 M\u2299 for \u03bce = 2. Some relevant\nproperties are given in Table 1.\nThe linear theory of normal modes for a cold\nwhite dwarf has been given by several authors (e.g.\nKippenhahn & Weigert 1990). We briefly review it to establish notation and to resolve some ambiguities. It is convenient to use Eulerian perturbations and to choose four\n\u03c3\nindependent variables which we write as \u03b7(r)Ylm\n(\u03b8, \u03c6)ei\u03c9t ,\nwhere\n\u03b7=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03ber \u03b4P + \u03c1\u03b4\u03a8 \u03b4\u03a8 \u03b4\u03a8\u2032\n,\n,\n,\nr\n\u03c1gr\ngr g\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\n\u03a8 is the Newtonian potential, g \u2261 \u03a8\u2032 is the gravitational\nacceleration, primes denote differentiation with respect to r,\n\u03c3\nand Ylm\nare the real spherical harmonics defined for m > 0\nby\ne\nYlm\n\u2261\no\nYlm\n\u2261\n\n\u001a\n\n\u001a\n\nYl0\n\u221a\n\u2217\n(Ylm + Ylm\n)/ 2\n0\n\u221a\n\u2217\n(Ylm \u2212 Ylm\n) /i 2\n\n, m=0\n, m>0\n, m=0\n, m>0.\n\nOur choice to use real rather than complex spherical harmonics allows us to avoid complications that would arise\nfrom the expansion of a real vector field in terms of complex basis vectors. Note that the Cowling approximation,\nwhich ignores the potential variation, is commonly used to\ndescribe stellar pulsations, but it is inadequate for our calculations. We denote the spatial displacement field for a mode\n\n\f4\n\nYasser Rathore, Roger D. Blandford and Avery E.

However, we make the nonstandard choice \u03b71 (R\u2217 ) = 1, where R\u2217 is the radius of the\nwhite dwarf. This ensures that the coefficient of a mode in\nan eigenfunction expansion is a measure of the relative surface displacement and, consequently, a measure of the mode\nnon-linearity.

In such places, j should be understood to mean the set of all other labels. Occasionally, we use\nthe index \u03c3 which can take on the values e or o.\n\nFigure 1. Radial eigenfunctions of quadrupolar f -modes for the\n0.6 M\u2299 model from Table 1.\n\nThe most important modes for our purpose are the\nquadrupolar f -modes. For a non-rotating star, the five f modes with l = 2 are degenerate in frequency. The eigenfrequencies for our three white dwarf models are given in\nTable 1.

A straightforward, Newtonian \"push-pull\" approach to the excitation of tides and the\nresulting perturbations to the orbit is perhaps the most intuitive. However, it is not transparently self-consistent in terms\nof conserving energy and angular momentum. A variational\napproach has the advantage of maintaining self-consistency\nexplicitly, and also has the potential for exposing underlying symmetries (Gingold & Monaghan 1980; Rathore et al.\n2003).\nWe expand the physical displacement, \u03be, of fluid elements within the white dwarf in terms of normal modes,\n\u03be(r, t) =\n\nj\n\nAj (t)\u03bej (r) .\n\nX\n\nLj ,\n\n(22)\n\nj\n\nAs the orbit shrinks, it circularises, eventually according to\ne \u221d n\u22121 , approximately.\nFor a more accurate treatment of gravitational radiation (especially for high eccentricities), and for the inclusion\nof other general relativistic effects, corrections to the orbital acceleration can be added directly to the equations of\nmotion. Detailed derivations and discussions of these corrections can be found in the literature (e.g. Iyer & Will 1995),\nand we shall not reproduce them here.\nIt should be noted that it is not necessary to worry\nabout relativistic apsidal precession as it will only affect neglected higher-order terms.\n\nX\n\nj\n\nand\n\n19 F3 (e)\n.\n18 F1 (e)\n\nFinally, we can integrate the above equation to get\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121305/2299\n(1 \u2212 e2 )3/2\n121 2\nn(e)\n=\n1\n+\ne\n.\nn(0.54101)\ne18/19\n304\n\n2.4\n\nNote that, as mentioned in \u00a72.2, we are not using the conventional normalisation for the normal modes.

We therefore\nsee that the Hamiltonian is comprised of three pieces: the\nKeplerian terms for the orbit, a sum of independent harmonic oscillators for the normal modes, and a sum of terms\nof the form xj fj which couple the modes and the orbit. The\noverlap integral fj therefore plays a dual role as a driving\nfunction for the excitation of tides, and in the disturbing\nfunction for the orbit. This is not surprising since the system\nis conservative. Hence, any energy and angular momentum\ntransferred to tides must be extracted necessarily from the\norbit.\nFrom Hamilton's equations for (24), we obtain the following equations of motion:\nfj\n,\n(25)\n\u1e8dj + \u03c9j2 xj =\nMj\np2u\nGM0 M\u2217\n\u2202fj\n\u2212\n+ xj\n,\n\u03bcR3\nR2\n\u2202R\n\u2202fj\n.\n\u1e57u = xj\n\u2202u\n\n\u1e57R =\n\n(26)\n(27)\n\n\f6\n\nYasser Rathore, Roger D.

It should be understood in the expression\n+\nfor fjk that, for k = 0, only the Xjk\nterms are present.\n\u00b1\nFor k > 0, the Xjk terms can be combined using trigonometric identities. However, it is simpler to note that, since\n\u2212\nXkp,m \u221d e|k\u2212m| , to lowest order in eccentricity, the Xjk\nterms\nwill be suppressed by 2m powers of eccentricity relative to\n+\nthe Xjk\nterms. Therefore, for low to moderate eccentricities\n\u2212\n(. 0.6) and m > 0, the Xjk\nterms can be neglected to a\n\u00b1\ngood approximation. For the case m = 0, the Xjk\nterms\nare identical. Hence, in all that follows, for m = 0 one only\n+\n+\nneeds to make the change Xjk\n\u2192 2Xjk\n.\nFrom the preceding discussion, we know that the driving function fj for the excitation of a particular mode is\nan infinite sum of fjk terms. The phases that appear in the\nexpression (31) for fjk are all of the form kl \u00b1 m\u031f. Thus,\n\nthere exists the possibility of resonance whenever the relative phase of the mode and one of these terms is stationary:\n\u1e87j = kl \u0307 \u00b1 m\u031f,\n \u0307 where wj is the phase of the mode. As\nmentioned previously, the kl \u2212 m\u031f terms will be suppressed\nby 2m powers of eccentricity relative to the kl + m\u031f terms.\nThus, the dominant resonances will occur for \u1e87j = kl \u0307 +m\u031f.\n \u0307\nIt might be thought that the above condition is equivalent\nto \u03c9j = kn, but, in general, this is not the case. As the\nevolution of the orbit is dependent upon the tides via the\nback reaction terms in the equations of motion, there are\ncomplicated, non-linear dependencies implicit in each of the\nvariables in the resonance condition. However, since we expect the orbital corrections to be relatively small, it should\nbe true that, at resonance, \u03c9j \u2243 kn.\n3\n3.1\n\nPHYSICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nThe tidal limit\n\nClearly, our formalism for treating the evolution of a WDCO\nbinary as a dynamical interaction between the orbit and the\ntides is only valid if the white dwarf is not tidally disrupted.\nIn other words, we require that the white dwarf does not fill\nits Roche lobe. This requirement constrains the harmonics\nof the orbital frequency that a given mode can interact resonantly with. To quantify the constraint, we use the following\napproximation to the radius of the Roche lobe:\nrR\n0.49q \u22122/3\n=\n\u22122/3\nR\n0.6q\n+ ln(1 + q \u22121/3 )\n(Eggleton 1983). It then follows that we require\nh\ni3/2\n0.6 + q 2/3 ln(1 + q \u22121/3 )\n2.92\u03c3j\nk&\n,\n(1 \u2212 e)3/2\n(1 + q)1/2\n\n(32)\n\nwhere we have made use of the facts that the orbital separation at periapse is a(1 \u2212 e), and that \u03c9j \u2243 kn at resonance.\nNote that we have implicitly assumed that the companion\nis more compact than the white dwarf, and hence is not\ndisrupted. This is certainly true when the companion is a\nneutron star or a black hole. However, for the white dwarfwhite dwarf case, the actual constraint is provided by the\nstar that is disrupted first, which may be the companion.\nIt should also be mentioned that the above approximation for the radius of the Roche lobe is for circular, synchronous orbits. A more general treatment of the Roche\nproblem may modify the tidal disruption regime. This is\na possibility for future investigation.\n3.2\n\nImportance of the l = m = 2 f -mode\n\nThe lowest l modes that can be excited tidally are l = 2.\nModes with higher values of l will have smaller overlap integrals, since fj \u221d R\u2212(l+1) . We may therefore infer that the\nprimary modes that are excited outside the Roche limit are\nthe l = 2 modes. It is also the case that, with our choice of\ncoordinates, the m = 1 modes will not be excited. This is\neasily seen by remembering that \u03b7j \u221d Plm (0), and\n\uf8f1\n(l + m \u2212 1)!!\n\uf8f2\n(\u22121)(l\u2212m)/2\n, l + m even\nm\nPl (0) =\n(l \u2212 m)!!\n\uf8f3\n0,\nl + m odd\n\n\fResonant Excitation of White Dwarf Oscillations in Compact Object Binaries: 1. The No Back Reaction Approxim\n(see, for example, Arfken & Weber 1995). Therefore, the\nonly l = 2 modes that are excited have m = 0, 2. Furthermore, since Xkp,m \u221d e|k\u2212m| , the m = 0 modes will be suppressed by two powers of eccentricity relative to the m = 2\nmodes. Hence, we deduce that the dominant modes for low\nto moderate eccentricities will have l = m = 2. Also, since\nthe p-mode frequencies increase monotonically with the radial order, we can access (before tidal disruption) the lowest\nharmonic resonances for the modes with lowest radial order\u2013\nthe f -modes.\nPutting together the above considerations, we conclude\nthat the mode excited with the largest amplitude in a cold\nwhite dwarf will be the l = m = 2 f -mode. Note that in\na warm star, g-modes can also be excited. These will have\nlower frequencies than the f -modes, and their frequencies\nwill decrease monotonically with the radial order. However,\nthe structure of g-modes is sensitive to assumptions about\nthe stellar model. If the modes are confined to surface layers,\nthen the overlap integrals will be essentially zero, and the\nmodes will not be excited tidally.\n\n3.3\n\nMode damping\n\nThe formalism that we have presented in \u00a72 does not include\nany mode damping. In a realistic scenario, white dwarf oscillations will damp out over sufficiently long periods of time.\nWhile we shall mention some possible mechanisms through\nwhich this might occur, we make no attempt to provide an\nexhaustive analysis as there is an extensive literature that\nexists for this problem.\nSome possible mechanisms that have been considered\nfor the damping of nonradial white dwarf oscillations include\ngravitational radiation, neutrino losses due to pycnonuclear reactions, and radiative heat leakage (Osaki & Hansen\n1973). The relative importance of each mechanism depends\non the type of mode under consideration, but it was demonstrated by Osaki & Hansen (1973) that the dominant damping mechanism for quadrupolar f - and p-modes, in the linear\nregime, is gravitational radiation. However, their calculation\ncontains a numerical error. We present a corrected derivation in Appendix C.\nAnother possible mechanism for the damping of modes\nwith large amplitudes is by non-linear coupling to other\nmodes. This has been explored extensively in various contexts (e.g. Dziembowski 1982; Kumar & Goodman 1996;\nWu & Goldreich 2001), and it has been shown that nonlinear mode interactions can be important amplitude limiting effects. In this paper, we ignore this complication because it is, in fact, one of our goals to study whether such\nnon-linear amplitudes can be excited by passage through a\nsequence of tidal resonances in a WDCO binary.\nIn stars with compositional discontinuities or solid interiors, turbulence may be excited at boundaries, which can\nlead to additional dissipation.\n\n3.4\n\norbit, is given by\nTGR\n\n5 (1 + q)1/3 \u22125\n=\n\u03b2\u2217\n256\u03c9\u2217\nq\n\n\u0012\n\nn\n\u03c9\u2217\n\n\u0013\u22128/3\n\n.\n\n(Peters 1964). For an eccentric orbit, the inspiral time has to\nbe calculated numerically. In general, for an eccentric orbit\nwith a given period, this time is shorter by up to a factor\nof 1000 for eccentricities up to 0.9, relative to the circular\norbit time. For eccentricities . 0.5, however, the circular\norbit inspiral time is a fair approximation.\nThe second relevant time-scale is the mode damping\ntime. In general, the damping times for quadrupolar f modes depend upon the white dwarf mass. Assuming gravitational radiation as the mechanism, the damping time (as\nderived in Appendix C) is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n6\u03c0 \u22125 \u22122\nMj\nTj =\n\u03c3j\u22124 .\n\u03b2\u2217 \u03b73j (R\u2217 )\n\u03c9\u2217\nM\u2217\n\nFor our 0.6 M\u2299 and 1.0 M\u2299 models, this gives \u223c 3000\nand \u223c 100 years, respectively. Note that these are necessarily underestimates since our cold white dwarf models are\nhighly centrally condensed. In contrast, the damping times\nfor \"moderately realistic\" 0.4 M\u2299 and 1.0 M\u2299 models used\nby Osaki & Hansen (1973) are about 2.8\u00d7105 and 500 years,\nrespectively. The damping times are therefore quite sensitive\nto the stellar model.\nFinally, the third time-scale of interest is the white\ndwarf cooling time. A rough estimate for this is provided\nby\n\u00135/7\n\u0012\n4.7 \u00d7 107 years M\u2217 /M\u2299\nTcool =\nA\nL\u2217 /L\u2299\n(Kippenhahn & Weigert 1990), where A is the atomic mass,\nand L\u2217 is the white dwarf luminosity. For typical parameters,\nthis gives a cooling time of \u223c 109 years, which is much longer\nthan any other relevant time-scale. We can therefore ignore\nthe thermal evolution of the white dwarf.\nIn order for mode damping via gravitational radiation\nto be physically unimportant during the long-term evolution\nof a WDCO system, it is necessary that Tj > TGR . In other\nwords, we require that the damping between resonances is\nnegligible during the gravitational inspiral. This gives us the\nfollowing constraint on the harmonics that we can consider\nfor a particular mode:\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u00153/8\n\u0012\n1536\u03c0\nq\nMj\n\u22124/3\n\u22122\nk.\n\u03c3j\n\u03b7 (R\u2217 )\n,\n(33)\n5 (1 + q)1/3 3j\nM\u2217\n\nwhere we have used the expressions for Tj and TGR given\nabove, and have also made use of \u03c9j \u2243 kn at resonance. For\nour 0.6 M\u2299 white dwarf model and mass ratios greater than\na few, this constraint evaluates to\n\u0012\n\u00131/4\nM0\nk . 11\n.\nM\u2299\nNote that, for moderate to high eccentricities, this is overly\nrestrictive, and the actual limit obtained from an evaluation\nof the inspiral time for eccentric orbits is higher.\n\nTime-scales\n\nFor the long term evolution of a WDCO binary, there are\nseveral time-scales of interest to us. The first of these is the\ngravitational radiation inspiral time, which, for a circular\n\n4\n\nRESONANT ENERGY TRANSFER\n\nLet us now consider a mode being excited resonantly on a\nwhite dwarf in an eccentric orbit around a compact compan-\n\n\f8\n\nYasser Rathore, Roger D. Blandford and Avery E. Broderick\n\nion. We shall neglect the back reaction terms in the equations of motion, and hence the orbit can be taken to be Keplerian with corrections due to gravitational radiation (the\nvalidity of the no back reaction approximation will be discussed in \u00a75.1). We assume that we start exciting the mode\nresonantly at t = 0, and limit our analysis to the regime\n\u1e45t/n \u226a 1, where \u1e45 is given by (16). This is not particularly\nrestrictive since the gravitational radiation time-scale is typically much longer than the resonance time-scale. Finally, we\nshall also assume low to moderate eccentricities (\u223c 0 \u2212 0.5),\n\u2212\nand hence neglect the Xjk\nterms in (31).\nWith the above assumptions, we can expand the orbital elements and phases in (31) in Taylor series around\nresonance (retaining only the zeroth-order term in the amplitude) to obtain\n\u0012 \u00132(l+1)/3\nq\u03b7j M\u2217 \u03c9\u22172 R\u2217\nn\n+\nfjk = \u2212\nXjk\n(1 + q)(l+1)/3 \u03c9\u2217\n(34)\n\u0001\n\u001a\ncos \u03c6jk + \u03c9j t + k\u1e45t2\u0001\n,\n\u00d7\nsin \u03c6jk + \u03c9j t + k\u1e45t2\n\nwhere \u03c6jk is an initial phase. We now note that (34) is exactly of the form of (8), with the identifications\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012 \u00132(l+1)/3\nM\u2217\nq\u03b7j \u03c9\u22172 R\u2217\nn\n+\nFR = \u2212\nXjk\n,\n\u03c9\u2217\n(1 + q)(l+1)/3 Mj\n\u03c90 = \u03c9j ,\n\n\u03b1\u03c902 = 2k\u1e45\n\n(the division by Mj in FR is necessary since it is fj /Mj that\nappears on the right hand side of (25)).

The values of the parameter \u0398j for our 0.6 M\u2299 ,\n1.0 M\u2299 , and 1.4 M\u2299 white dwarf models are given in Table 1. We see that the energy transfer decreases monotonically (relative to the star's binding energy) with the mass.\nAs \u039ejk (e) \u221d e2(k\u2212m) , to lowest order in eccentricity, the\nenergy transfer is typically a very sensitive function of the\neccentricity. Also, for a circular orbit, it is clear that only\nthe fundamental resonance, k = m, exists (as would be expected on physical grounds). We remind the reader that, for\nm 6= 0, the energy transfer given by (35) is for a particular\nchoice of even or odd mode. It should therefore be multiplied\nby a factor of two to obtain the total energy transfer to the\neven-odd mode pair.\n\n5\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n5.1\n\nRegime of validity\n\nWe now consider in what regime, if any, the no back reaction\napproximation is valid. Qualitatively, we expect back reaction to change the orbital frequency as a mode is excited\nresonantly, which will tend to push the system away from\nresonance. Clearly, this will modulate the energy transfer\nat some level. However, if the change in orbital frequency\nis small compared to the resonance width, then we expect\nthat the modulation of energy transfer will not be significant. On the other hand, if the change in orbital frequency\nis comparable to or larger than the resonance width, then\nback reaction will play a significant role. Another way of\nsaying this is that the modulation of the energy transfer by\nback reaction is a second-order effect. Therefore, as long as\nthe energy transfer is small enough, we are justified in ignoring back reaction. We can quantify this criterion by defining\na resonance parameter\n\u03c7jk \u2261\n\n\u2206njk\n,\n\u2206nres\nk\n\n(38)\n\nwhere \u2206njk is what the change in kn would be if the energy\ngiven by (35) were to be taken out of the orbit, and \u2206nres\nk is\nthe resonance width. In general, we expect that for \u03c7jk \u226a 1\nback reaction will not play a significant role in modulating\nthe energy transfer, where as for \u03c7jk & 1 back reaction will\n1/2\nbe important. Using the estimate \u2206nres\n, we find\nk \u2248 (2k \u1e45)\n\u03c7jk =\n\nr\n\n\u221215/2\n\n(8l\u221223)/6\n\n\u03b7j2 \u03c3j\n5 5\u03c0 \u03b2\u2217\n1/2\n3 2048 q (1 + q)(4l\u22121)/6\n\u00d7\n\nk\u2212(4l\u22127)/3\n3/2\n\nF1\n\n+\nXjk\n\n\u0012\n\u00012\n\nM\u2217\nMj\n\n\u0013\n\n(39)\n\n.\n\nFigure 2 shows the numerical integration across a particular\nresonance for various values of \u03c7jk , both with and without\nback reaction. The first qualitative feature that stands out\nis that the energy transfer with back reaction tends to be\nsmaller than that without back reaction. This is not surprising since the system with back reaction is expected to spend\nless time near resonance. Quantitatively, we see that for this\nparticular resonance with \u03c7jk . 0.1 we obtain nearly identical numerical results with and without back reaction, with\n\u03c7jk \u223c 0.1 the results differ by a factor of order unity (about\n2), and with \u03c7jk \u223c 1 the energy transfers differ by an order\nof magnitude.\nThe delineation of the back reaction and no back reaction regimes in the eccentricity-harmonic plane obtained\nwith the above criterion for a quadrupolar f -mode on a\n0.6 M\u2299 white dwarf and various companion masses is shown\nin Figure 3. It is seen that the region of parameter space\nwhere back reaction may be neglected, according to the \u03c7jk\ncriterion, grows with the companion mass. There is, however, a reason to think that back reaction might actually\nplay an important role in some regions of the parameter\nspace where the \u03c7jk criterion indicates otherwise.\nConsider the following thought experiment. Imagine\nthat we are approaching a resonance with an initial phase\nthat would lead to a net negative energy transfer in the no\nback reaction approximation. As we start removing energy\nfrom the mode and depositing it into the orbit, the orbital\n\n\fResonant Excitation of White Dwarf Oscillations in Compact Object Binaries: 1. The No Back Reaction Approxim\n\nFigure 2. The energy in the l = m = 2 f -mode on a 0.6 M\u2299 white dwarf is shown for a passage through the k = 15 resonance\nwith different values of the parameter \u03c7jk obtained by varying the eccentricity, and with q = 10, 000. In each plot, the dashed curve\nis the system without back reaction, and the solid curve is the system with back reaction. The curves have been smoothed to remove\nhigh-frequency components.\n\nfrequency will necessarily decrease (i.e. the semi-major axis\nwill increase) and the system will get pushed off resonance.\nIt will then have another chance to approach the same resonance. Then, if the phase is such that energy is transferred\nto the mode, then the system will once again get pushed\noff resonance, but this time in the opposite direction (since\nthe orbital frequency will increase). Gravitational radiation\nwill then evolve the system away from this resonance and\ntowards the next one. This scenario hints at the possibility\nthat back reaction may force the resonant energy transfer\nto be always positive. However, this is not necessarily the\ncase. For instance, we have assumed that there is sufficient\ninitial energy in the mode to be able to change the orbital\nfrequency significantly. Also, we have neglected the fact that\ngravitational radiation will be removing energy from the orbit as we are transferring energy to the orbit from the mode.\nIf the rate of dissipation by gravitational radiation is high\nenough, then back reaction may not matter. The system will\nevolve through resonance regardless, on a time-scale determined by the rate of dissipation. Hence, we can still get a\nnet negative energy transfer to the mode.\nIn summary, back reaction may be important in determining both the magnitude and the direction of resonant\nenergy transfer. The \u03c7jk criterion provides, in some sense,\nonly a measure of the correction to the magnitude. In the\n\nregime where \u03c7jk & 1, the implication is unambiguous: back\nreaction will be essential in determining the energy transfer.\nHowever, when \u03c7jk < 1, things are somewhat uncertain for\nreasons stated above. A solution of the problem including\nback reaction is required to determine conclusively whether\nback reaction is important in that regime.\n\n5.2\n\nLong term evolution\n\nIn \u00a74, we calculated the energy transfer for an individual\nresonance in the absence of back reaction. In general, as the\nbinary shrinks under gravitational radiation, the system will\npass through a sequence of resonances for each mode. However, this is only a possibility for an eccentric orbit because,\nas demonstrated previously, only the fundamental resonance\nexists for a circular orbit. We note that, in the no back reaction approximation, the energy transfer at a resonance can\nbe negative as well as positive, depending on the relative\nphase of the mode and the driver, and the initial amplitude. Also, there will be negligible average energy transfer\nbetween resonances, as long as we are well outside the tidal\nlimit. If we assume (as seems reasonable) that the system\nhas no long term phase memory, then the relative phasing\nat each resonance will be essentially random, with a uniform\ndistribution. It then follows that, on average, the mode will\n\n\f10\n\nYasser Rathore, Roger D. Blandford and Avery E. Broderick\n\nFigure 3.

It then follows from (9) and our assumptions of\nrandom phases and negligible energy transfer between resonances that, for a sequence of resonances in the no back\nreaction approximation, the evolution of the mode energy\nwill be given by the discrete random walk (with a drift)\n!\nr\nEk\n(40)\nCk ,\nEk\u22121 = Ek + \u03b5k 1 + 2\n\u03b5k\nwhere Ck is a random variable drawn from the distribution\n1\np(x) = \u221a\n, x \u2208 [\u22121, 1] .\n\u03c0 1 \u2212 x2\n\nFor a derivation of elementary statistical properties of this\nrandom walk, see Appendix D.\nFigure 4 shows the results from calculations of passage\nthrough a sequence of resonances performed using the above\nrandom walk model for several sets of initial conditions.

(An amplitude of unity for a l = m = 2\nmode corresponds to a maximum physical displacement of\nthe stellar surface of about 55% relative to the unperturbed\nradius.) We therefore expect that the linear normal mode\nanalysis might not be valid in those cases, and that nonlinear effects may in fact determine the actual outcome.\nIt should be noted that, even if back reaction plays a role\nin determining the direction of energy transfer, our result\nthat non-linear amplitudes for a l = m = 2 f -mode can\nbe attained by passage through a sequence of resonances\nis unlikely to be affected. This is due to the fact that the\nresult depends chiefly upon the allowed magnitude of energy\ntransfer, and as we restricted our calculations to the regime\nwhere \u03c7jk \u226a 1, back reaction is not expected to change\nthings.\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we have discussed a specific dynamical problem: what is the energy transfer to the normal modes of a\nwhite dwarf due to tidal resonances in a compact object binary inspiralling under gravitational radiation? For simplicity, we have considered only non-rotating, completely degenerate stellar models. We have provided a semi-analytical\nanswer for the case when the perturbation of the orbit by\nthe modes may be neglected (the no back reaction approximation). It has been shown that, ignoring back reaction, and\nassuming that the relative phase of the mode and the orbit\nis randomised between successive resonances, the energy in\na mode executes a discrete random walk, with a drift, during\n\npassage through a sequence of resonances. In addition, we\nhave found that the amplitude of a l = m = 2 f -mode can\nbe driven into the non-linear regime as a result of passage\nthrough such a sequence. We have also demonstrated that\nback reaction can modulate the amount of energy transferred significantly, depending upon the parameters of the\nsystem. Our attempt to delineate the regime in parameter\nspace where the no back reaction approximation is valid has\nhad mixed success: we can predict when back reaction will\nbe definitely important, but a clear delineation of the regime\nwhere it will be unimportant has not been found. Despite\nthis ambiguity, our result that non-linear amplitudes can be\nattained for a l = m = 2 f -mode is expected to be robust.\nA treatment of the problem including back reaction will be\nthe subject of a future publication.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nRDB would like to thank J.

Blandford and Avery E. Broderick\n\nIt can be shown that the power radiated by a quadrupolar mode is independent of m (this is a consequence of\nthe Wigner-Eckart theorem). Hence, we can restrict ourselves to the m = 0 case for simplicity. It then follows\nthat Q11 = Q22 = \u2212Q33 /2, and that the off-diagonal terms\nvanish. Therefore, noting that the time dependence is sinusoidal, we have\ndEjGW\nG 6 ...2\n=\u2212\n\u03c9 Q ,\ndt\n60c5 j 33\n\n(C1)\n\nwhere Q33 should now be understood to mean the timeindependent amplitude of the mass quadrupole moment.\nWriting the mass density as\n\nSince Ek will only depend upon C\u03b1 , for \u03b1 > k, Zk is linear\nin Ck . As all the Ck are independent random variables (by\nassumption), it follows that\nhZk i = 0 ,\n\nThe above integral can be simplified by using the linearised\nPoisson equation, integrating by parts twice, and using the\nsurface boundary condition \u03b74 = \u2212(l + 1)\u03b73 .

From (D1), we have\n\n\u03c1(x) = \u03c10 (r) + Bj \u03b4\u03c1j (r)Y20 (r\u0302) ,\nwhere Bj is the amplitude of the mode and \u03b4\u03c1j is the normalised density perturbation associated with the mode, we\nfind\nr\nZ R\u2217\n\u03c0\nQ33 = 4\ndr r 4 \u03b4\u03c1(r) .\nBj\n5\n0\n\nhZk2 i = 2\u03b5k hEk i .\n\n(D5)\n\nas all the terms linear in \u2206p will vanish when averaged. To\ncalculate h\u22062p i, we write\n\u22062p =\n\nk\nX\n\nZ\u03b12 + 2\n\n\u03b1=k\u2212p+1\n\nk\u22121\nX\n\nk\nX\n\nZ\u03b1 Z\u03b2 ,\n\n\u03b1=k\u2212p+1 \u03b2=\u03b1+1\n\nand note that, since \u03b2 > \u03b1 in the above double sum, each\nterm of the double sum will be linear in C\u03b1 , and will, hence,\nvanish upon averaging. Therefore, we have\nh\u22062p i = 2\n\nk\nX\n\n\u03b1=k\u2212p+1\n\n\u03b5\u03b1 hE\u03b1 i .\n\nSubstituting into (D5), and then using (D4), we find\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nk\nk\nX\nX\n2\n\u03b5\u03b2 \uf8f8 .\n(D6)\n\u03b5\u03b1 \uf8ed E k +\n\u03c3p = 2\n\u03b1=k\u2212p+1\n\n\u03b2=\u03b1+1\n\nIt should be noted that (D1) is not Gaussian, nor will\nit become Gaussian after many resonances. That the process is not Gaussian is clear from the fact that the random\nwalk is bounded from below. Furthermore, the central limit\ntheorem is not applicable because, typically, the probability\ndistribution of \u2206p is dominated by the most recent few harmonics, and hence the effective number of variables never\nbecomes large.\n\nThis paper has been typeset from a TEX/ LATEX file prepared\nby the author.\n\n\f"}
