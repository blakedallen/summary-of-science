MONDRAGON AND R. E. ALLEN\nDepartment of Physics, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 77843, USA\ne-mail: mondragon@tamu.edu\nA new theory yields unconventional results for the angular distribution of products\nlike b \u2212 b\u0304 jets in Higgs decays.\n\nAccording to a new fundamental theory,1,2 Higgs fields have an unconventional equation of motion\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2212 (g \u03bc\u03bd D\u03bc D\u03bd + ime\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c3 \u03b1 D\u03bc ) \u03a6h \u2212 \u03bc2h \u03a6h + b \u03a6\u2020h \u03a6h \u03a6h = 0.\n(1)\n(See (13) of Ref. 2.) At very high energies and field strengths, this goes over\nto the usual form\n\u0011i\nh\n\u0010\n(2)\n\u2212g \u03bc\u03bd D\u03bc D\u03bd \u2212 \u03bc2h + b \u03a6\u2020h \u03a6h \u03a6h = 0.\nAt low energies and field strengths, however, it becomes\n\u0011i\nh\n\u0010\nie\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c3 \u03b1 D\u03bc + \u03bc\ne \u2212 eb \u03a6\u2020h \u03a6h \u03a6h = 0\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03bc\ne = \u03bc2h /m and eb = b/m.\n\nIn flat spacetime (e\u03bc\u03b1 = \u03b4\u03b1\u03bc ), and with gauge couplings ignored, (3) reduces\n\nto\n\n\u0011i\nh\n\u0010\ni\u03c3 k \u2202k \u03a6h = \u2212i\u22020 \u2212 \u03bc\ne + eb \u03a6\u2020h \u03a6h \u03a6h\n\n(4)\n\nfor the original Higgs fields. For the physical Higgs boson \u03c6h , on the other\nhand, a standard treatment gives the above equation of motion with \u2212e\n\u03bc\u2192\n\u03bc\u0304 = 2e\n\u03bc and different self-interaction terms.3 If these self-interactions are also\nneglected, we obtain\n2\n\n\u2212 \u2202 k \u2202k \u03c6h = (i\u22020 \u2212 \u03bc\u0304) \u03c6h\n\n(5)\n\nso that\n2\n\np2 = (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03bc\u0304)\n\n(6)\n\n\u03c9 = p + \u03bc\u0304\n\n(7)\n\nand\n\npascos: submitted to World Scientific on October 25, 2018\n\n1\n\n\ffor the physical branch, where p is the magnitude of the 3-momentum. Because the present picture involves (physically acceptable) violations of Lorentz\ninvariance,1,2,4 the energy-momentum relation of the Higgs is quite different\nfrom\nq\n\u03c9 = p2 + m2h\n(8)\nand observable properties like angular distributions in decays are consequently\npredicted to be different.\nA simple illustration is the kinematics of the h0 \u2192 q q\u0304 decay, with q\nrepresenting a light particle like the bottom quark.5,6 Conservation of energy\nimplies that\nph + mh = pq + pq\u0304\n\n(9)\n\np2h = p2q + p2q\u0304 + 2pq pq\u0304 + m2h \u2212 2mh (pq + pq\u0304 )\n\n(10)\n\nor\nif the mass of q is neglected. (We now write mh for \u03bc\u0304.) Conservation of\n3-momentum gives\np2h = p2q + p2q\u0304 + 2 pq *pq\u0304\n\n(11)\n\nor, in terms of the opening angle \u03b8,\np2h = p2q + p2q\u0304 + 2 pq pq\u0304 cos \u03b8.\n\n(12)\n\nThe predicted angular distribution\ncos \u03b8 = 1 +\n\npq + pq\u0304\nm2h\n\u2212 mh\n2pq pq\u0304\npq pq\u0304\n\n(13)\n\nis then quite different from the standard result\ncos \u03b8 = 1 \u2212\n\nm2h\n2pq pq\u0304\n\n(14)\n\nfor energies significantly above threshold. For example, if the emerging particles or jets have equal energy, and the total energy is twice the threshold\nfor Higgs production, the opening angle is 120\u25e6 in the present picture, rather\nthan 60\u25e6 .\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was supported by the Robert A.
