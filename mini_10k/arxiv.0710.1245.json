Phys.\n\n\fSpectroscopy of strontium Rydberg states using EIT\n\n2\n\nLaser-cooled atoms can be excited into high-lying electronic states to form a\n\"frozen\" gas of Rydberg atoms [1], where the energy scale associated with the\nstrong dipole-dipole interactions between the atoms is much larger than their thermal\nenergy. This system exhibits rich many-body quantum behaviour, such as the \"dipole\nblockade\" effect [2, 3, 4, 5], where a single Rydberg excitation can be shared by several\nentangled atoms [6]. This effect could be used to realise fast two-qubit quantum logic\ngates between trapped neutral atoms [7]. By exciting the atoms above the ionization\nthreshold, an ultra-cold plasma can be created [8]. These plasmas can reach a strongly\ncoupled regime, where the Coulomb interaction between the ions dominates their\nkinetic energy, and spatial correlations become important [9]. Rydberg atoms form\nin these plasmas due to three-body recombination [10], and spectroscopy of Rydberg\natoms inside the plasma could be used to obtain information on the electric field [11].\nAtoms with two valence electrons such as strontium offer several advantages for\nexperiments on ultra-cold Rydberg gases and plasmas. Narrow intercombination lines\nallow laser cooling to temperatures below 1 \u03bcK [12], and extremely high spectroscopic\nresolution [13]. In addition, their singly-charged ions have a strong optical transition in\nthe visible, unlike those of alkali metals which have a closed-shell electronic structure.\nThis allows the ions in the plasma to be imaged, yielding spatially resolved information\non the ion density and temperature [14, 15].\nIn most experiments on ultra-cold Rydberg gases the Rydberg atoms are detected\nindirectly by using field ionization and subsequent detection of the electrons and\nions [16]. This technique is efficient and widely applicable, but is destructive.\nRecently [17] , it was shown that electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) can\nbe used to probe Rydberg states of rubidium atoms in a vapour cell non-destructively\nand with high resolution. In combination with strong Rydberg-Rydberg interactions,\nthis could also be used to realise a phase gate between single photons [18].\nIn this paper we extend this technique to Rydberg states of strontium atoms in a\neffusive atomic beam. This technique could be used to make high-resolution, real time\nmeasurements of the properties of ultracold Rydberg gases and plasmas. Although\nEIT was first observed in strontium [19], most subsequent work has focussed on the\nalkali metals. Recently, an ultra-precise optical lattice clock based on EIT with bosonic\n88\nSr atoms was proposed [20]. This work is the first observation of EIT in strontium\nusing narrow-linewidth CW lasers.\nThe ladder system studied in these experiments and the experimental setup are\nshown in figure 1. The probe beam is resonant with the 5s2 1 S0 \u2192 5s5p 1 P1 transition\nat 460.7 nm, and the coupling beam at 420 nm is resonant with transitions from the\n5s5p 1 P1 intermediate state to a 5sns 1 S0 or 5snd 1 D2 Rydberg state. Both the probe\nand the coupling beams are generated using commercial frequency-doubled diode laser\nsystems, and are tuned using a commerical wavemeter and data on the Rydberg\nenergy levels taken from [21]. The probe and coupling beams are overlapped and\ncounter-propagate perpendicularly to the effusive atomic beam of strontium atoms. A\nphotodiode monitors the transmission of the probe beam as its frequency is scanned\nacross the transition. A second probe laser beam allows real-time measurement of the\nprobe transmission without the coupling laser present. Each probe laser beam has a\npower of 150 \u03bcW and a waist of 1 mm (1/e2 radius), and the two beams are separated\nby 4 mm. The coupling beam power is typically 12 mW. The probe laser beams\nare linearly polarized in the vertical direction, and the coupling laser is circularly\npolarized. This combination was chosen empirically as giving the largest EIT signals\nunder our experimental conditions. To produce the atomic beam, strontium metal is\n\n\f3\n\nSpectroscopy of strontium Rydberg states using EIT\n\n\\\u0013 \u0304\n\n\u0018VQV\u0003\u00146\u0013\n\n\u0018VQG\u0003\u0014'\n\nSUREH $\nEHDPV\n\n%\n\n\u0015\n\nDWRPLF\nEHDP\n\nFRXSOLQJ\n\u0017\u0015\u0013QP\n\\\u0012 \u0304\n\n\u0018V\u0018S\u0003\u00143\u0014\n%6\n\nSUREH\n\u0017\u0019\u0014QP\n\nD\n\\\u0011 \u0304\n\nFRXSOLQJ\nEHDP\n\nE\n\n\u0018V\u0015\u0003\u00146\u0013\n\nFigure 1. (a) Energy level diagram showing the two ladder systems available.\n(b) Schematic of the experiment. Probe and coupling beams overlap on a glass\nplate (BS) and counter-propagate at right angles to the atomic beam. Two\nspatially separate probe beams allow simultaneous measurement of the probe\nbeam transmission with and without the coupling light.\n\nheated in an oven, and the beam is collimated by a bundle of stainless steel capillaries\nthat restrict the geometric divergence to 43 mrad full width.\nTo calibrate the probe laser frequency scan, we use saturated absorption\nspectroscopy and the measured isotope shifts of the 5s2 1 S0 \u2192 5s5p 1 P1 transition.\nThe saturated absorption spectrum is obtained by replacing the coupling beam with\na pump beam at 461 nm derived from the probe laser. An example spectrum is shown\nin figure 2. The spectrum is fitted using the sum of six Lorentzian components (one\nfor each isotope and hyperfine component), with the shift and weighting of each\ncomponent taken from table 1, and the width constrained to the natural linewidth\nof the transition (\u03b32 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 16 MHz). The free parameters are a linear frequency axis\nscaling and offset, and the peak absorption. The scaling factor and offset are used to\ncalibrate the frequency axis of EIT data obtained with the same probe laser scan. The\naccuracy of the scaling factor determines the accuracy of frequency intervals obtained\nfrom the EIT data. By examining the residuals from this fit we estimate that the\nuncertainty in the scaling factor is 3 %.\nIf the coupling laser is tuned close to the 5s5p 1 P1 \u2192 5s18d 1 D2 transition in the\ndominant 88 Sr isotope, then we obtain the spectrum shown in figure 3a. A narrow EIT\nresonance feature enhances the transmission in a narrow spectral window within the\nDoppler-broadened absorption profile. The position and amplitude of the resonance\ndepends on the detuning of the coupling laser. The difference between the transmission\nof the two probe beams is shown in figure 3b. The width of the EIT peak is 5 MHz\n(FWHM), which is considerably narrower than the natural width of the intermediate\n1\nP1 state (\u03b32 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 16 MHz), and the maximum reduction in absorption is 8%. With\nthe coupling laser tuned exactly on resonance, we observe a change in absorption of\nup to 12%.\nIn order to understand these data in more detail, we have compared them to a\n\n\f4\n\nSpectroscopy of strontium Rydberg states using EIT\n\nFigure 2.

This includes\nthe lifetime of the Rydberg state as well as other line-broadening mechanisms, and is\ntreated as a fit parameter.\nThe lineshape is obtained by summing the contribution to \u03c7(v) from all four\nisotopes and integrating the imaginary part of (1) over the transverse velocity\ndistribution of the atomic beam. In figure 3b, the coupling laser is tuned such that\nonly the 88 Sr isotope contributes to the EIT resonance part of the signal, and so we\nset \u03a9c = 0 for the other isotopes to simplify the numerical integration.\nA standard treatment of the transverse velocity distribution of an effusive\n\n\fSpectroscopy of strontium Rydberg states using EIT\n\n5\n\nFigure 3.

The thin blue line is the difference between the fit in (a)\nand the same curve with \u03a9c = 0 (all other parameters as in (a)).\n\natomic beam [25] assumes that the velocity distribution inside the oven follows a\nMaxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and that the divergence angle \u01eb of the beam is\nfixed geometrically by an aperture some distance from the exit slit of the oven.\nCollisions with the walls of the exit slit or the collimation aperture are neglected.\nThe result is a Gaussian transverse velocity distribution, with a Doppler width that\nis reduced by a factor sin \u01eb from that obtained in a vapour at thermal equilibrium\nat the same temperature. We find that using a Gaussian velocity distribution, we\nare unable to describe the shape of the Doppler broadened absorption profile. This\nis almost certainly due to collisions with the walls of the capillaries (length=8mm,\ndiameter = 0.17 mm) used to collimate the atomic beam, which modify the transverse\nvelocity distribution. Empirically, we find that a Lorentzian distribution N (v) \u221d\nnat /(1 + v 2 /\u2206v 2 ) for the transverse velocity gives good agreement with our data.\nAs a result, there are five adjustable parameters in our model: the half-width of\nthe Lorentzian velocity distribution \u2206v, the density of the atomic beam nat , the\nparameters \u2206c , \u03a9c of the coupling laser and the rate \u03b33 .\nThe results of this model are compared with our data in figures 3a and 3b.

By looking at the behaviour of the\nmodel in more detail, we see that the latter effect arises from the combination of\nthe wavelength mismatch between the probe and coupling beams and the velocity\naveraging. However, we do not observe the increase in absorption that is predicted to\noccur on both sides of the EIT peak, and which was observed in similar experiments\nin rubidium [17].\nBy varying the coupling laser detuning, we are also able to observe EIT signals\ndue to the other isotopes. Figure 4a shows EIT signals due to both the 86 Sr and 88 Sr\nisotopes. We do not observe a signal due to the 87 Sr isotope. The hyperfine interaction\nsplits the 87 Sr line into nine components, and for 15 \u2264 n \u2264 25 the hyperfine splitting of\nthe 5snd 1 D2 Rydberg states is very large (\u223c 1 GHz) due to strong mixing with nearby\ntriplet states [26, 27]. As a result of this it is difficult to observe an EIT signal due\nto this isotope. In contrast, no hyperfine splitting occurs for the 5sns 1S0 states. The\nEIT signal that we obtain with the coupling laser tuned to the 5s5p 1 P1 \u2192 5s19s 1S0\ntransition is shown in figure 4b. In this experiment, the amplitude of the coupling\nlaser was modulated using a chopper, and with lock-in detection we observed the\nsignal from the 86 Sr, 87 Sr and 88 Sr isotopes.

This results in a separation\nbetween the EIT signals for each hyperfine component of less than 5 MHz, which is\nnot resolved in figure 4b.\nThe frequency intervals measured in figure 3 and the isotope shifts given in\ntable 1 can be used to obtain the isotope shifts of the Rydberg states relative to\nthe 5s2 1 S0 ground state. In addition to the scaling in the intermediate state, the\nwavelength mismatch also results in frequency separations in the Rydberg state being\nscaled by \u03bbc /\u03bbp . The results are given in table 2. Our measurement of the 88 Sr - 86 Sr\nisotope shift on the 5s2 1 S0 \u2192 5s18d 1D2 transition is in agreement with a previous\nvalue of 229\u00b15 MHz reported in [28]. The uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty\nin the frequency axis calibration. This could be substantially improved by scanning\nthe laser with an acousto-optic modulator, or by using a well-characterised etalon to\ncalibrate the scan. The narrow linewidth of the EIT features would then allow isotope\nshifts and hyperfine splitting to be determined with better than 1 MHz resolution.\nIn summary we have shown that electromagnetically induced transparency can\nbe used to probe the Rydberg states of strontium atoms with high resolution. As\nan illustration, isotope shifts were measured for transitions from the ground state to\nthe 5s18d 1D2 and 5s19s 1S0 states. This technique could have important applications\nas a non-destructive, high-resolution probe of strongly interacting Rydberg gases and\nplasmas.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to C. S. Adams, I.
