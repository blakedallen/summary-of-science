For a\nwide range of relevant temperatures and angular velocities of newly born, hot, rapidly-rotating stars, bulk and\nshear viscosity do not suppress the exponential growth of\nthe energy of the r-mode [2, 3].\nIn the above-mentioned investigations [2, 3], the linearized hydrodynamics equations with the GR force were\nused to obtain an expression for the time evolution of the\nphysical energy of the r-mode perturbation, dE/dt, from\nwhich the gravitational radiation and viscous timescales\nwere determined. In this work, in which the main results\nof Ref. [4] are reported, we present an explicit expression\nfor the r-mode velocity perturbations that solves the linearized hydrodynamics equations with the GR force. Our\nconclusions are that (i) these velocity perturbations are\nsinusoidal with the same frequency as the well-known GR\nforce-free linear r-mode solution, (ii) the GR force drives\nthe r-modes unstable with a growth timescale that agrees\nwith the expression found in Refs. [2, 3], and (iii) the\namplitude of these velocity perturbations is corrected,\nrelatively to the GR force-free case, by a term of order\n\u03a96 .\n\n\u2217 Also\n\nat Centro Multidisciplinar de Astrof\u0131\u0301sica \u2013 CENTRA.\n\nHYDRODYNAMIC EQUATIONS WITH GR\nREACTION FORCE\n\nThe Newtonian hydrodynamic equations for a uniformly rotating, barotropic, non-magnetized, perfectfluid star in the presence of the gravitational radiation\n(GR) reaction force are the Euler, continuity, and Poisson equations given, respectively, by\n~ v = \u2212\u03c1\u22121 \u2207P\n~ \u2212 \u2207\u03a6\n~ + F~ GR ,\n\u2202t~v + (~v * \u2207)~\n~ * (\u03c1~v ) = 0,\n\u2202t \u03c1 + \u2207\n2\n\n\u2207 \u03a6 = 4\u03c0G\u03c1,\n\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c1, P and ~v are, respectively, the density, the pressure and the velocity of the fluid, \u03a6 is the Newtonian\npotential, and the GR reaction force,\n~ + ~v \u00d7 (\u2207\n~\n~ \u00d7 \u03b2),\nF~ GR = \u2212\u2202t \u03b2\n\n(5)\n\nis assumed to be given by the 3.5 post-Newtonian order\nexpansion that includes the contribution of the current\nquadrupole moment, which is the main responsible for\n~ is\nthe GR instability that sets in [5, 6].

(18) and\n(19), we recover the GR force-free linear r-mode solution.\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS AND\nFUTURE DIRECTIONS\n\nIn this work we have presented the analytical r-mode\nsolution to the linearized Newtonian hydrodynamic equations with the GR reaction force. The velocity perturbations \u03b4 (1)~v are proportional to ei(2\u03c6+\u03c90 t) , with \u03c90 =\n\u22124\u03a9/3. Thus, they have the same sinusoidal behavior\nand the same frequency \u03c90 as the GR force-free velocity perturbations given by Eq. (11). The amplitude of\nthe velocity perturbations is proportional to exp{\u2212\u031ft}.\nSince \u031f < 0, the GR force induces then an exponential\ngrowth in the r-mode amplitude. The e-folding growth\ntimescale \u03c4GR = 1/\u031f agrees with the GR timescale (1)\nfound in Refs. [2, 3]. The velocity perturbations \u03b4 (1)~v\ncontain also a piece proportional to \u03b1\u03b3(A \u2212 1)\u03a96 , where\nA is an arbitrary constant fixed by the choice of initial\ndata. If we choose this constant A to be of order unity,\nthen this part of the solution could be neglected [4].\nA quite interesting feature that has emerged from recent investigations on r-modes is the presence of differential rotation induced by the r-mode oscillation in a back-\n\n[1] N.

That\ndifferential rotation drifts of kinematical nature could be\ninduced by r-mode oscillations of the stellar fluid was first\nsuggested in Ref. [7]. The existence of these drifts was\nconfirmed in numerical simulations of nonlinear r-modes\ncarried out both in general relativistic hydrodynamics\n[8] and in Newtonian hydrodynamics [9]. Differential rotation was also reported in a model of a thin spherical\nshell of a rotating incompressible fluid [10]. Recently, an\nanalytical solution, representing differential rotation of\nr-modes that produce large scale drifts of fluid elements\nalong stellar latitudes, was found within the nonlinear\nNewtonian theory up to second order in the mode amplitude and in the absence of GR reaction [11]. This differential rotation plays a relevant role in the nonlinear evolution of the r-mode instability [12]. Two questions could\nbe then naturally raised, namely, is differential rotation\nalso induced by the gravitational radiation reaction and\ndoes this differential rotation play a relevant role in the\nnonlinear evolution of the r-mode instability? One of the\naims of the investigation carried out in Ref. [4] is to initiate a programme that hopefully will allow to answer this\nquestion. The natural continuation of this investigation\nis then to try to find an analytical r-mode solution of the\nnonlinear hydrodynamic equations with the GR reaction\nforce. This work is in progress [13].\nAcknowledgments\n\nIt is a pleasure to thank Kostas Kokkotas and Luciano\nRezzolla for interesting discussions.
