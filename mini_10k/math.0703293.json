Introduction\nThere has been recent interest in developing a non-commutative version of differential geometry based on Kontsevich's philosophy [10, 12] that for a property of a\nnon-commutative k-algebra A to have geometric meaning it should induce standard\ngeometric properties on all representation spaces Rep(A, N ) = Hom(A, MN (k)).\nNon-commutative symplectic geometry was developed in [3, 6, 8, 11] and a noncommutative version of (quasi-)Poisson geometry was introduced in [14].\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 53D30.\nKey words and phrases. Non-commutative geometry, poly-vector fields, Schouten bracket.\nThe author is a director of Research at the FWO.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMICHEL VAN DEN BERGH\n\nIn this paper we introduce so-called quasi-bisymplectic algebras (see \u00a76). These\nare a multiplicative analogue of algebras equipped with a bisymplectic form (see [6]).\nOur definition is such that the representation spaces of quasi-bisymplectic algebras\nare quasi-Hamiltonian G-spaces, as introduced in [2]. We develop non-commutative\nanalogues for some aspects of the commutative theory [1, 2]. In particular we\nshow that there is a one-one correspondence between quasi-bisymplectic algebras\nand Hamiltonian double quasi-Poisson algebras (introduced in [14]) which satisfy a\nsuitable non-degeneracy condition (see Theorem 7.1 below).\nAs a side result we show that double quasi-Poisson algebras give rise to something we call a \"double Lie algebroid\" (see Theorem 5.3 below). This is a noncommutative version of [4, Thm. 2.5].\nIn the final section of the paper we show that the Hamiltonian double quasiPoisson algebras derived from quivers which were introduced in [14] are non-degenerate.\nHence these algebras are also in a natural way quasi-bisymplectic.\nThe main result of this paper was announced in [14, App A] where we discussed\nthe relation between ordinary double Poisson brackets and bisymplectic forms (i.e.\nthe \"non-quasi\"case). It should be said however that our proof for the equivalence\nbetween integrability of double quasi-Poisson brackets and quasi-bisymplectic forms\nis based on a brute force computation and is less satisfactory than the corresponding\nproof in [14, App A].\nThis paper depends rather heavily on [6, 14]. For the convenience of the reader\nwe have included some preliminary sections explaining the relevant concepts and\nresults. To simplify the exposition we have chosen to write out all our computations\nover a base ring which is a field, although that is not sufficient for the application to\nquivers. Therefore in the short section \u00a78.1 we outline the modifications necessary\nto handle more general situations.\nA change in presentation with respect to [14] is that throughout the paper we\nhave emphasized a certain functor\n(\u2212)N : Bimod(A) \u2192 Mod(O(Rep(A, N )))\nwhich connect an algebra with its N 'th representation space. When applied to a\nnon-commutative object this functor yields the corresponding classical object. For\nexample if L is a double Lie algebroid over A (see above) then LN is a classical Lie\nalgebroid on Rep(A.N ).\nThe author wished to thank Victor Ginzburg for explaining some aspects of [7].\n2. Preliminaries\n2.1. Representation spaces. We assume that k is a field of characteristic zero\nalthough this hypotheses is often too strong. Throughout A is a finitely generated\nk-algebra. For N \u2208 N the associated representation space of A is defined as\nRep(A, N ) = Hom(A, MN (k))\nThe group GlN acts on Rep(A, N ) by conjugation on MN (k).\nA natural point of view in non-commutative algebraic geometry is that for a\nproperty of a non-commutative ring A to have geometric meaning it should induce\nstandard geometric properties on all Rep(A, N ).\nIt is easy to see that Rep(A, N ) is an affine variety and its coordinate ring has\ndef\n\na very convenient description. It is easy to see that the ring AN = O(Rep(A, N ))\n\n\fNON-COMMUTATIVE QUASI-HAMILTONIAN SPACES\n\n3\n\nis generated by the symbols (aij )ij=1,...,N , subject to the relations\n(ab)ij = ail blj\ntogether with additivity in a and 1ij = \u03b4ij . Here and below we sum over repeated\nindices. While this description is very convenient it is of course also very uneconomical. For example if A = kh(xl )l=1,...,n i then O(Rep(A, N )) = k[(xl,ij )l=1,...,n,i,j=1,...,N ].\nIt is easy to verify that our assumption that A is finitely generated implies that\nO(Rep(A, N )) is finitely generated.\nIf a \u2208 A then aij defines a matrix values function on Rep(A, N ) which we\nsometimes denote by X(a). Concretely this is the function which associates to\nevery \u03c6 : A \u2192 MN (k) \u2208 Rep(A, N ) the matrix (\u03c6(a))ij .\nWe define the trace tr(a) of a \u2208 A as aii . This defines a Gln -invariant function\non Rep(A, N ). As tr([A, A]) = 0 we see that elements of A/[A, A] correspond to\ninvariant functions on Rep(A, N ). In fact this will be true in all cases we consider\nbelow: the non-commutative version of working with GlN invariants objects is\nworking modulo commutators.\n2.2. Differential forms. We now consider differential forms. The bimodule \u03a9A\nof differentials is generated as an A-bimodule by the symbols da subject to the\nrelations d(ab) = a(db) + (da)b and linearity. As usual one puts \u03a9A = TA \u03a9A .\nDefining d(da) = 0, d(a) = da makes \u03a9A into a differential graded algebra. Every\nhomogeneous element \u03c9 in \u03a9A has a representations a0 da1 * * * dan . To such an\nelement one associate a matrix valued differential form:\n(2.1)\n\n\u03c9ij = a1,i1 da2,i1 i2 * * * dan,in\u22121 j\n\n(\u03c9ij )ij is a matrix valued differential form on Rep(Q, \u03b1). If we write it as X(\u03c9)\nthen (2.1) may be rewritten as\nX(\u03c9) = X(a1 )dX(a2 ) * * * dX(an )\nIt would be tempting to define the non-commutative de Rham complex of A as \u03a9A.\nHowever, quite remarkably (see [6, \u00a72.5]), \u03a9A is acyclic. That is\n(\nk m=0\nm\nH (\u03a9A) =\n0 otherwise\nNevertheless \u03a9A can be used as the basis for a new construction of the cyclic\nhomology of A (see [7]).\nA different non-commutative analogue of the de Rham complex is the Karoubi-de\nRham complex which is defined by\nDR(A) = \u03a9A/[\u03a9A, \u03a9A]\nThe de Rham cohomology of A is defined as the cohomology of the Karoubi complex.\nIt is closely related to cyclic homology and to equivariant de Rham cohomology of\nrepresentation spaces (see [7, Thm 4.2.3]). According to [13, 2.6.7] we have a short\nexact sequence of reduced (co)homology\n0 \u2192 H\u0304 n (DR(A)) \u2192 HCn (A) \u2192 HHn+1 (A) \u2192 0\nBelow we will mostly deal with smooth algebras, i.e. algebras whose category of\nbimodules has homological dimension one. In that case HHn (A) = 0 for n > 1 and\nhence H\u0304 n (DR(A)) = HCn (A) for n \u2265 1. The following lemma is instructive.\n\n\f4\n\nMICHEL VAN DEN BERGH\n\nTo any element \u03c9 we associate a Gln invariant differential form tr(\u03c9) = \u03c9ii . It\nthis way we obtain a map\ntr : DR(A) \u2192 \u03a9(Rep(A, N ))Gl(n)\nwhich descends to cohomology.\nExample 2.1. Let C = k[t, t\u22121 ]. Then\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2k\nH i (DR(C)) = k(t\u22121 dt)i\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0\n\nif i = 0\nif i is odd\notherwise\n\nThat the cohomology groups have the indicated dimension follows from [13, Cor\n3.4.15]. It is easy to see that the generators for the cohomology groups are as\nclaimed.\nWe have Rep(A, N ) = GlN . The elements tr(t\u22121 dt)2i+1 are precisely the generators of the de Rham cohomology of GlN .\n2.3. Vector fields. Now we discuss vector fields. Again there are two possible\npoints of view.\nIf we insist that a vector field on A induces vector fields on all Rep(A, N ) then a\nvector field on A should simply be a derivation \u2206 : A \u2192 A. The induced derivation\n\u03b4 on O(Rep(A, N )) is then given by\n\u03b4(aij ) = \u2206(a)ij\nA second point of view is that a vector field \u2206 on A should induce matrix valued\nvector fields (\u2206ij )i,j=1,...,n on all Rep(A, N ). Since now \u2206ij (auv ) depends on four\nindices \u2206(a) should be an element of A \u2297 A. It was first of observed by CrawleyBoevey that the second point of view is often more useful. Put\ndef\n\nDA = Der(A, A \u2297 A) = HomA\u2297A\u25e6 (\u03a9A , A \u2297 A)\nwhere as usual we put the outer bimodule structure on A \u2297 A. The corresponding\nmatrix valued vector fields on Rep(A, N ) are then given by\n(2.2)\n\n\u2206ij (auv ) = \u2206(a)\u2032uj \u2206(a)\u2032\u2032iv\n\nwhere by convention we write an element x of A \u2297 A as x\u2032 \u2297 x\u2032\u2032 (i.e. we drop the\nsummation sign). We will call the peculiar arrangement of indices in (2.2) the\nstandard index convention. It will reappear often below.\nStarting with DA we define the algebra of poly-vector fields DA on A as the\ntensor algebra TA DA of DA where we make DA into an A-bimodule by using the\ninner bimodule structure on A \u2297 A. Any homogeneous element \u03b4 of DA induces\npolyvector fields X(\u03b4) on all representation spaces using a formula similar to (2.1).\nThe counterpart to the differential on \u03a9A is the \"double Schouten Nijenhuys\"\nbracket on DA which was defined in [14]. A double bracket on an ordinary algebra\nA is a bilinear map\n{{\u2212, \u2212}} : A \u00d7 A \u2192 A \u2297 A\nwhich is a derivation in its second argument (for the outer bimodule structure on\nA) and which satisfies\n\u25e6\n{{a, b}} = \u2212{{b, a}}\n\n\fNON-COMMUTATIVE QUASI-HAMILTONIAN SPACES\n\n5\n\nwhere (u \u2297 v)\u25e6 = v \u2297 u. If {{\u2212, \u2212}} satisfies the following analogue of the Jacobi\nidentity\ndef\n\n0 = {{a, b, c}} = {{a, {{b, c}}}}L + \u03c4(123) {{b, {{c, a}}}}L + \u03c4(132) {{c, {{a, b}}}}L\nwhere for \u03c4 \u2208 Sn we define\n(2.3)\n\n\u03c4 (a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 an ) = a\u03c4 \u22121 (1) \u2297 * * * \u2297 a\u03c4 \u22121 (n)\n\n(with sign in the graded case) then we call {{\u2212, \u2212}} a double Poisson bracket. A\ndouble Poisson bracket induces a Lie bracket {\u2212, \u2212} on A/[A, A] via the formula\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n{a, b} = {{a, b}} {{a, b}}\n\nThe motivation for introducing double Poisson brackets is that they induce ordinary\nPoisson brackets on Rep(A, N ) via the standard index convention. The precise\nformula is\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n{aij , buv } = {{a, b}}uj {{a, b}}iv\nOne of the main results of [14] is the following.\nProposition 2.2. The graded algebra DA has the structure of a double Gerstenhaber algebra i.e. a (super) double Poisson algebra with a double Poisson bracket\n{{\u2212, \u2212}} of degree \u22121.\nFor the convenience of the reader we give the construction of the double SchoutenNijenhuys bracket on DA .\nIf \u03b4, \u2206 \u2208 DA then it is easy to see that\n{{\u03b4, \u2206}} \u0303l = (\u03b4 \u2297 1)\u2206 \u2212 (1 \u2297 \u2206)\u03b4\n{{\u03b4, \u2206}} \u0303r = (1 \u2297 \u03b4)\u2206 \u2212 (\u2206 \u2297 1)\u03b4 = \u2212{{\u2206, \u03b4}} \u0303l\ndefine derivations A \u2192 A\u22973 for the outer bimodule structure on A\u22973 .

The formula is obtained by linear extension from the following formula\nwith \u03b4, \u2206 \u2208 DA :\n(2.4)\n\n{{a, b}}\u03b4\u2206 = \u2206(b)\u2032 \u03b4(a)\u2032\u2032 \u2297 \u03b4(a)\u2032 \u2206(b)\u2032\u2032 \u2212 \u03b4(b)\u2032 \u2206(a)\u2032\u2032 \u2297 \u2206(a)\u2032 \u03b4(b)\u2032\u2032\n\nIf A is smooth then the double Jacobi identity for {{\u2212, \u2212}} is equivalent to {P, P } =\n0.\nThe algebra DA has a remarkable element E which has no commutative counter\npart. It is the double derivation which sends a to a \u2297 1 \u2212 1 \u2297 a. It is intimately\nconnected to the GlN action on Rep(A, N ). More precisely the following result was\nproved in [6, 14]\nProposition 2.3.1. Let fij \u2208 M\u03b1 = Lie(GlN ) be the elementary matrix which\nis 1 in the (i, j)-entry and zero everywhere else. Then (Ep )ij acts as fji on\nO(Rep(A, N )).\nThe element E appears in several pleasing formulas. For example for any polyvector field \u2206 in DA we have\n{{E, \u2206}} = \u2206 \u2297 1 \u2212 1 \u2297 \u2206\nA vector field of the form\nHa = {{a, \u2212}}\nis called Hamiltonian. An element \u03a6 \u2208 A is a moment map if it realizes E as a\nHamiltonian vector field, i.e. if E = H\u03a6 . We should think of \u03a6 as defining a matrix\nvalued map\n\u03a6ij : Rep(A, N ) \u2192 Rep(k[t], N ) = MN (k)\nIf \u03a6 is a moment map for {{\u2212, \u2212}} then \u03a6ij is a moment map for the induced Poisson\nbracket {\u2212, \u2212}.\n2.4. Bisymplectic geometry. In the commutative case symplectic geometry is\na special case of Poisson geometry. A first version of non-commutative symplectic\ngeometry was introduced by Kontsevich in [11]. See also [3, 8]. A version of Poisson\ngeometry following a similar philosophy was introduced by Crawley-Boevey in [5].\nA different version of non-commutative symplectic geometry which follows a\nsimilar philosophy as the Poisson geometry outlined in the previous sections was\nintroduced in [6] and baptized \"bisymplectic geometry\". We recall the definition.\nIf \u03b4 \u2208 DA then we may define a double derivation\ni\u03b4 : \u03a9A \u2192 \u03a9A \u2297 \u03a9A\nin the usual way. For a \u2208 A put\ni\u03b4 (a) = 0\n\ni\u03b4 (da) = \u03b4(a)\n\nIf C is a graded k-algebra and c = c1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 cn then we put\n(2.5)\n\n\u25e6\n\nc = \u03c4(1***n) (c) = (\u22121)|cn |(|c1 |+***+|cn\u22121 |) cn c1 * * * cn\u22121\n\n\fNON-COMMUTATIVE QUASI-HAMILTONIAN SPACES\n\n7\n\nand if \u03c6 : C \u2192 C \u22972 is a linear map then we define\n\u25e6\n\n\u03c6 : C/[C, C] \u2192 C : c 7\u2192 \u25e6 (\u03c6(c))\n\nWe apply this with C = \u03a9A. Following [6] we put\n\u0131\u03b4 = \u25e6i\u03b4\nAlso following [6] we say that an element \u03c9 \u2208 DR2 (A) is a bi-non-degenerate if the\nmap of A-bimodules\n\u0131(\u03c9) : DA \u2192 \u03a9A : \u03b4 7\u2192 \u0131\u03b4 \u03c9\nis an isomorphism (in fact it is sufficient to assume surjectivity, see Corollary 3.1.3\nbelow). If in addition \u03c9 is closed in DR(A) then we say that \u03c9 is bisymplectic.\nIt was shown in [6] that if \u03c9 is bisymplectic the tr(\u03c9) defines a symplectic form\non representation spaces.\n3. Generalities about bimodules\nIn the framework of this paper the non-commutative version of a coherent sheaf is\na bimodule. In this short section we discuss some elementary aspects of bimodules.\n3.1. Pairings. Let A be an arbitrary k-algebra. A pairing (or bilinear map) between A \u2212 A bimodules P, Q is a map\nh\u2212, \u2212i : P \u00d7 Q \u2192 A \u2297 A\nsuch that hp, \u2212i is linear for the outer bimodule structure on A \u2297 A and h\u2212, qi\nis linear for the inner bimodule structure on A \u2297 A. The obvious example is of\ncourse P = Q\u2217 and h\u2212, \u2212i is the evaluation pairing. We say that the pairing is\nnon-degenerate if P , Q are finitely generated projective bimodules and the pairing\ninduces an isomorphism Q \u223c\n= P \u2217.\nIf h\u2212, \u2212i is a pairing between P and Q then the opposite pairing between Q and\nP is given by\nhq, pi\u25e6 = hp, qi\u2032\u2032 \u2297 hp, qi\u2032\nIf we have pairings between P and Q and between P \u2032 and Q\u2032 the morphisms \u03b1 :\nP \u2192 P \u2032 , \u03b2 : Q\u2032 \u2192 Q are said to be adjoint if\nh\u03b1(p), q \u2032 i = hp, \u03b2(q \u2032 )i\nWe say that \u03b1 is left adjoint to \u03b2 and that \u03b2 is a right adjoint of \u03b1. Note that if\nwe change the pairings into the opposite ones then a left adjoint becomes a right\nadjoint and vice versa. Therefore we usually drop the left/right adjectives if what\nis meant is clear from the context. If the pairing are non-degenerate then we denote\nan adjoint often by (\u2212)\u2217 .\nIf we have a morphism \u03b1 : P \u2192 Q then then we say that \u03b1 is anti-symmetric (or\nanti-self adjoint) if \u2212\u03b1 is left adjoint to \u03b1 for the appropriate pairings, i.e. if\nhp, \u03b1(p\u2032 )i = \u2212h\u03b1(p), p\u2032 i\u25e6\nfor p, p\u2032 \u2208 P .\nOr written out explicitly\n(3.1)\n\nhp, \u03b1(p\u2032 )i\u2032 \u2297 hp, \u03b1(p\u2032 )i\u2032\u2032 = \u2212hp\u2032 , \u03b1(p)i\u2032\u2032 \u2297 hp\u2032 , \u03b1(p)i\u2032\n\nIf we have a pairing between P and Q as above then p \u2208 P defines a double\nderivation of degree \u22121\nip : TA (Q) \u2192 TA (Q) \u2297 TA (Q)\n\n\f8\n\nMICHEL VAN DEN BERGH\n\nsuch that ip (q) = hp, qi. Since Q and P are related by the opposite pairing we may\ndefine iq for q \u2208 Q in the same way. I.e.\niq : TA (P ) \u2192 TA (P ) \u2297 TA (P )\nis the double derivation of degree \u22121 such that iq (p) = hq, pi\u25e6 .\nWe define \u0131p = \u25e6 ip and \u0131q = \u25e6 iq as in \u00a72.4. If \u03c9 \u2208 TA2 Q then we put\n\u0131(\u03c9) : P \u2192 Q : p 7\u2192 \u0131p (\u03c9)\nThis is a bimodule morphism between P and Q. The following property of \u0131(\u03c9)\nwill be used below.\nProposition 3.1.1. The bimodule morphism \u0131(\u03c9) is anti-symmetric.\nProof. We need to prove that hp, \u0131(\u03c9)(p\u2032 )i = hp, \u0131p\u2032 \u03c9i satisfies (3.1). We write \u03c9 as\n\u03c9 \u2032 \u2297 \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 with \u03c9 \u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 \u2208 Q. Then we have\nip\u2032 (\u03c9) = ip\u2032 (\u03c9 \u2032 )\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2032 ip\u2032 (\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 )\nso that we get\n\u0131p\u2032 (\u03c9) = ip\u2032 (\u03c9 \u2032 )\u2032\u2032 \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 ip\u2032 (\u03c9 \u2032 )\u2032 \u2212 ip\u2032 (\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 )\u2032\u2032 \u03c9 \u2032 ip\u2032 (\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 )\u2032\n= hp\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032 i\u2032\u2032 \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 hp\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032 i\u2032 \u2212 hp\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 i\u2032\u2032 \u03c9 \u2032 hp\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 i\u2032\nand hence\nhp, \u0131p\u2032 \u03c9i = hp\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032 i\u2032\u2032 hp, \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 ihp\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032 i\u2032 \u2212 hp\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 i\u2032\u2032 hp, \u03c9 \u2032 ihp\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 i\u2032\n= hp\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032 i\u2032\u2032 hp, \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 i\u2032 \u2297 hp, \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 i\u2032\u2032 hp\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032 i\u2032 \u2212 hp\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 i\u2032\u2032 hp, \u03c9 \u2032 i\u2032 \u2297 hp, \u03c9 \u2032 i\u2032\u2032 hp\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 i\u2032\nwhich is clearly satisfies (3.1).\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 3.1.2. Assume that the pairing h\u2212, \u2212i is non-degenerate. If \u0131(\u03c9) is\nsurjective then it is an isomorphism.\nProof. Let \u03b1 = \u0131(\u03c9). If \u03b1 is surjective then its left adjoint \u03b1\u2217 : Q\u2217 \u2192 P \u2217 is\ninjective. Since the pairing is non-degenerate we have Q\u2217 = P and P \u2217 = Q. Hence\nwe may identify \u03b1\u2217 with \u2212\u03b1. So \u03b1 is both injective and surjective and hence it is\nan isomorphism.\n\u0003\nWe can now state the following corollary which was asserted in \u00a72.4.\nCorollary 3.1.3. Assume that \u03c9 \u2208 DR2 (A) is such that the map of bimodules\n\u0131(\u03c9) : DA \u2192 \u03a9A : \u03b4 7\u2192 \u0131\u03b4 \u03c9\nis surjective. Then \u03c9 is bi-non-degenerate.\nIf h\u2212, \u2212i : P \u00d7 Q \u2192 A \u2297 A then we call a dual bases sets of elements p\u03b1 \u2208 P ,\nq\u03b1 \u2208 Q such that hp\u03b1 , \u2212i\u2032 q\u03b1 hp\u03b1 , \u2212i\u2032\u2032 is the identity map on Q. It is easy to see that\nthis equivalent to h\u2212, q\u03b1 i\u2032\u2032 p\u03b1 h\u2212, q\u03b1 i\u2032 being the identity map on P .\nProposition 3.1.4. Assume that the pairing h\u2212, \u2212i : P \u00d7 Q \u2192 A \u2297 A is nondegenerate. Then the map\n\u0131 : TA2 Q \u2192 HomAe (P, Q)\ndefines an isomorphism between (TA Q/[TA Q, TA Q])2 and the anti-symmetric elements of HomAe (P, Q).\n\n\fNON-COMMUTATIVE QUASI-HAMILTONIAN SPACES\n\n9\n\nProof. It is easy to write down an explicit inverse to \u0131. Let p\u03b1 \u2208 P , q\u03b1 \u2208 Q be dual\nbases. Then the element of TA2 Q corresponding to \u03b1 \u2208 HomAe (P, Q)asym is given\n\u0003\nby \u2212 21 \u03b1(p\u03b1 )q\u03b1 .\nWe will also have occasion to use the following result\nProposition 3.1.5. Assume h\u2212, \u2212i is a non-degenerate pairing between P and Q.\n(1) Let \u03c9 \u2208 (TA Q/[TAQ, TA Q])n . If \u0131p (\u03c9) = 0 for all p \u2208 P then \u03c9 = 0.\n(2) Let \u03b7 \u2208 T n Q. If the projection of ip (\u03b7) on A \u2297 T n\u22122 Q is zero for al p \u2208 P\nthen \u03b7 = 0.\nProof. We select dual bases p\u03b1 , q\u03b1 . The following formulas are easily verified for\n\u03c9 \u2208 TAn Q\nmod[\u2212, \u2212]\nq\u03b1 \u0131p\u03b1 (\u03c9) = n\u03c9\n\u2032\n(pr1 (ip\u03b1 (\u03b7))) q\u03b1 (pr1 (ip\u03b1 (\u03b7)))\u2032\u2032 = \u03b7\nFrom this the stated results follow.\n\u0003\n3.2. Double Lie algebroids. It will be convenient to make the following definition.\nDefinition 3.2.1. A double Lie algebroid over A is an A-bimodule L together with\na (graded) double Poisson bracket of degree \u22121 on TA L.\nThe archetypical example of a double Lie algebroid is DA where we equip\nTA DA = DA with its double Schouten bracket (see \u00a72.3).\nAssume that L is a double Lie algebroid with double bracket {{\u2212, \u2212}}. As for\nDA we have associated operations {{\u2212, \u2212}}l , {{\u2212, \u2212}}r which are homomorphisms\nL \u00d7 L \u2192 L \u2297 A and L \u00d7 L \u2192 A \u2297 L respectively that are defined by\n{{l1 , l2 }} = {{l1 , l2 }}l + {{l1 , l2 }}r\n{{\u2212, \u2212}}l and {{\u2212, \u2212}}r determine each other via\n\u25e6\n\n{{l1 , l2 }}r = \u2212{{l2 , l1 }}l\n\nIt follows that the minimal data necessary to specify a double Lie algebroid is given\nby\n{{\u2212, \u2212}}l : L \u00d7 L \u2192 L \u2297 A\n{{\u2212, \u2212}} : L \u00d7 A \u2192 A\nOne can write down a minimal set of axioms these operations have to satisfy (see\n[14, (3.4-1)-(3.8-1)]). However it is often more straightforward to use Definition\n3.2.1 directly.\n3.3. Representation spaces. Let's now discuss how this plays out with representation spaces. if P is an A-bimodule then we define PN as the AN (cfr \u00a72.1)-module\ngenerated by symbols pij which are linear in p \u2208 P and which satisfy for a \u2208 A:\n(ap)ij = aiu puj\n(pa)ij = auj piu\nIn this way we obtain an additive functor\n(\u2212)N : Mod(Ae ) \u2192 Mod(AN )\nwhich sends finitely generated bimodules to finitely generated modules.\nThis functor has a more intrinsic description as follows.\n\n\f10\n\nMICHEL VAN DEN BERGH\n\nLemma 3.3.1. [6] Consider MN (AN ) as an A-bimodule via the k-algebra morphism A \u2192 MN (AN ) : a 7\u2192: aij . Consider MN (AN ) in addition as an AN -module\nvia the diagonal embedding AN \u2192 MN (AN ). Then there is a natural isomorphism\nPN \u223c\n= P \u2297Ae MN (AN )\nIn particular (\u2212)N is right exact and sends projective bimodules to projective modules.\nProof. We will content ourselves by giving the maps. Let fij be the usual elementary matrix in MN (AN ). Then one isomorphism is given by\nPN \u2192 P \u2297Ae MN (AN ) : pij \u2192 p \u2297 fji\nwith the obvious definition for the inverse isomorphism.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 3.3.2. We have (TA P )N = SAN PN .\nProof. It is easy to see that both sides have the same generators and relations. \u0003\nLemma 3.3.3. If h\u2212, \u2212i : P \u00d7Q \u2192 A\u2297A is non-degenerate then the corresponding\npairing between PN and QN (obtained by applying the standard index convention\nfrom \u00a72.3)\nh\u2212, \u2212i : PN \u2297 QN \u2192 A : (pij , quv ) 7\u2192 hp, qi\u2032uj hp, qi\u2032\u2032iv\nis non-degenerate as well.\nProof. It follows from non-degeneracy that we may select p\u03b1 \u2208 P , q\u03b1 \u2208 Q such that\nq = hp\u03b1 , qi\u2032 q\u03b1 hp\u03b1 , qi\u2032\u2032\nfor all q \u2208 Q. It follows\nhp\u03b1,ij , quv iq\u03b1,ji = hp\u03b1 , qi\u2032uj hp, q\u03b1 i\u2032\u2032iv q\u03b1,ji\n= (hp\u03b1 , qi\u2032 q\u03b1 hp\u03b1 , qi\u2032\u2032 )uv\n= quv\nand hence the induced map QN \u2192 PN\u2217 : quv 7\u2192 h\u2212, quv i is injective and split by \u03c6 7\u2192\nq\u03b1,ji \u03c6(p\u03b1,ij ). Employing the dual argument we find that it is an isomorphism. \u0003\nProposition 3.3.4. Assume that A is smooth. Then the map DA \u2192 Der(A)\ndefined by (2.2) yields an isomorphism (DA )N \u2192 Der(A). In particular the tangent\nspace to Rep(A, N ) is generated by the vector fields \u03b4ij for \u03b4 \u2208 Der(A, N ).\nProof. It is easy to see that (\u03a9A )N = \u03a9AN . By the previous lemma we find\nDer(AN ) \u223c\n= (DA )N\n= ((\u03a9A )N )\u2217 \u223c\n= \u03a9\u2217 \u223c\nAN\n\nIt is easy to check that that the actual isomorphism is the asserted one.\n\u0003\nV\nCorollary 3.3.5.

(B3) and (B3') are equivalent.\nProof. (Sketch) We first dualize (B3'). Let \u03b2 : Tx \u2192 g : \u03b4 7\u2192 i\u03b4 (\u03a6\u2217 (\u03b8)). Then (B3')\nis equivalent to the condition\n(B3\") The map (\u03c9x , \u03b2) : Tx \u2192 Tx\u2217 \u2295 g is injective.\nIt is a straightforward verification using (B2) that the following diagram\n\u03b1\n\ng \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nx\n\uf8e6\n\u03b2\uf8e6\n\n(4.1)\n\ng\nx\n\uf8e6\u03b3\n\uf8e6\n\nTx \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03a9x\n\u03c9x\n\n\u2212 12 (1\n\nwith \u03b1(\u03be) =\n+ Ad(\u03a6(x)))(\u03be) and (\u03b3(\u03b7), \u03be) = i\u03bex (\u03b7) is commutative, Furthermore using the properties of \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304 (see e.g [9, Ch II]) we find \u03b2(\u03bex ) = (1 \u2212\nAd(\u03a6(x))\u22121 )(\u03be).\nLet us show that (B3) implies (B3\"). Assume that \u03b4 is such that i\u03b4 (\u03c9x ) = 0 and\ni\u03b4 (\u03a6\u2217 (\u03b8)) = 0. By (B3) we have that \u03b4 = \u03bex where (1 + Ad(\u03a6(x)))(\u03be) = 0. Since\n\u03b2(\u03bex ) = 0 we also have (1 \u2212 Ad(\u03a6(x)))(\u03be) = 0 by diagram (4.1). These two facts\ntogether imply that \u03be = 0.\n1We follow the convention from [1, Def 10.1]. In [2] this formula is given with a minus sign\n\n\fNON-COMMUTATIVE QUASI-HAMILTONIAN SPACES\n\n13\n\nNow we prove the converse. Assume that \u03b4 \u2208 ker(\u03c9x ).

Hence by (B3\")\n\u03b4 = 21 \u03bex . (B3) now follows from (4.2).\n\u0003\n\u2217\nWe now state the main theorem of [1, \u00a710]. Write \u03b8 = f a \u03b8a where \u03b8a \u2208 TX\nand\nsimilarly for \u03b8\u0304.\n\nTheorem 4.2. [1, Thm 10.3] Every non-degenerate Hamiltonian quasi-Poisson\nspace (X, P, \u03a6) carries a unique 2-form \u03c9 such that (X, \u03c9, \u03a6) is a quasi-Hamiltonian\nG-space and such that \u03c9 and P satisfy the following compatibility condition\n1 a\n\u2297 \u03a6\u2217 (\u03b8a \u2212 \u03b8\u0304a )\n(4.3)\nP \u25e6 \u03c9 = 1 \u2212 fX\n4\n\u2217\n(as maps TX\n\u2192 TX ).

The same is also true for (P3) as the following proposition\nshows.\nProposition 5.2. Assume that (P1)(P3) hold. Then tr(P ) defines a non-degenerate\nquasi-Poisson bracket on Rep(A, N )\nProof. Applying the right exact functor (\u2212)N (lemma 3.3.1) and using Proposition\n2.3.1 together with Corollary 3.3.5 we find that the map\n\u03a9AN \u2295 AN \u2297 glN \u2192 Der(AN )\nis surjective.

Furthermore we regard the diagram as\nbeing doubly infinite with period (3, 2). The bimodules occur in pairs related by an\nobvious non-degenerate pairing: (DA , \u03a9A ), (AE \u2217 A, AEA) and (A(d\u03a6)\u2217 A, A(d\u03a6)A).\nWe now define the maps.\n(1) c stands for \"canonical map\".\n\n\fNON-COMMUTATIVE QUASI-HAMILTONIAN SPACES\n\n17\n\n(2) e is adjoint to c.

They are respectively\ngiven by the following formulas.\nS 0 ((d\u03a6)\u2217 ) = E\u03a6\u22121 \u2212 \u03a6\u22121 E\nT 0 (E \u2217 ) = \u03a6\u22121 d\u03a6 \u2212 d\u03a6\u03a6\u22121\nFrom the stated adjointness properties it follows that the (7.1) is self dual, up to\nsign.

To avoid confusion: statements in the above lemma which do not refer\nto \u0131(\u03c9) or \u0131(P ) remain true if these maps are not present in the diagram.\nProof. We leave the verification of (1) and (2) to the reader. For (3) will only\ngive an example. E.g. we need to check in particular that the following diagram is\nbicartesian\nec\nAd\u03a6A \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 AE \u2217 A\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\uf6be\n\uf8e6\n\u0131y\ny\nAEA \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 A(d\u03a6)\u2217 A\nec\n\ne\n\nPut R = A , \u03a61 = \u03a6 \u2297 1, \u03a62 = 1 \u2297 \u03a6. The latter are two commuting invertible\nelements of R. Removing all confusing decoration the above diagram basically looks\nlike\n\u03a61 \u2212\u03a62\n\u2212\u2212\u2192 R\nR \u2212\u2212\u2212\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u03a6 +\u03a6\n\u03a61 +\u03a62 y\ny 1 2\nR \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 R\n\u03a61 \u2212\u03a62\n\nIt is now clear that this diagram is bicartesian (using the fact that \u03a61 and \u03a62 are\ninvertible). The other 2 \u00d7 2-diagrams in (7.1) are similar.\n(4) and (5) are similar. To prove (4) we only need to consider the first diagram\nas the second follows by duality. Assume that there are \u03b4 \u2208 DA , \u03b7 \u2208 Ad\u03a6A such\nthat\n(7.3)\n\n\u0131(\u03c9)(\u03b4) = c(\u03b7)\n\nWe need to prove that there is a unique \u2206 \u2208 AEA such that c(\u2206) = \u03b4, \u0131(\u2206) = \u03b7.\nWe need to worry only about existence since (2) implies that\n(ec, \u0131) : AEA \u2192 A(d\u03a6)\u2217 A \u2295 Ad\u03a6A\nis injective and hence (c, \u0131) is also injective.\nApplying e to (7.3) we find \uf6bee(\u03b4) = e\u0131(\u03c9)(c) = ec(\u03b7). By (3) there is an element\n\u03b4 \u2032 \u2208 AEA such that \u0131(\u03b4 \u2032 ) = \u03b7, ec(\u03b4 \u2032 ) = e(\u03b4). Replacing \u03b7 by \u03b7 \u2212 \u0131(\u03b4 \u2032 ), \u03b4 by \u03b4 \u2212 c(\u03b4 \u2032 )\nwe reduce to the case \u03b7 = 0, e(\u03b4) = 0, \u0131(\u03c9)(\u03b4) = 0.\nNow we note that (B3) implies by duality that the following map is injective\n(\u0131(\u03c9), e) : DA \u2192 \u03a9A \u2295 A(d\u03a6)\u2217 A\nHence \u03b4 = 0 and we can take \u2206 = 0.\n\n\u0003\n\nUsing the maps in (7.1) the compatibility condition (C) can be reformulated as\n(7.4)\n\n1\n\u0131(P )\u0131(\u03c9) = 1 \u2212 S\n4\n\n\fNON-COMMUTATIVE QUASI-HAMILTONIAN SPACES\n\n19\n\nwhere S = cS 0 e. In fact it will be convenient to give some other equivalent formulations of (7.4).

It is now clear that (7.5) and (7.7) are equivalent.\nSimilarly (7.6) and (7.8) are equivalent.

It follows that (7.9) is equivalent to (7.5)(7.6)\nsimultaneously. The same holds for (7.9).\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 7.1(1). If \u0131(\u03c9) exists it will have the following two properties for\n\u03b7 \u2208 \u03a9A , \u03b4 \u2208 AEA\n1\n(7.11)\n\u0131(\u03c9)\u0131(P )(\u03b7) = \u03b7 \u2212 T (\u03b7)\n4\n(7.12)\n\u0131(\u03c9)c(\u03b4) = c\u0131(\u03b4)\n\nwhere we have used lemmas 7.2 and Prop. 7.4. Since we are assuming (P3) every\nelement of DA can be written as a sum \u0131(P )(\u03b7) + c(\u03b4) for \u03b7 \u2208 \u03a9A and \u03b4 \u2208 AEA.\nHence the properties (7.11)(7.12) characterize \u0131(\u03c9) uniquely (and \u03c9 as well by Prop.\n3.1.4).\nWe still need to prove two things.\n(1) The equations (7.11)(7.12) are non-contradictory.\n(2) The resulting \u0131(\u03c9) is actually anti-symmetric (so that it genuinely comes\nfrom an element \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a92A ).\n\n\u0013\n0\n1\n\n\f20\n\nMICHEL VAN DEN BERGH\n\n(3) \u0131(\u03c9) satisfies (B3).\nWe discuss (1) first. Suppose that \u0131(P )(\u03b7) = c(\u03b4). Then by lemma 7.1 there exist\n\u03b70 \u2208 Ad\u03a6p A such that \u03b7 = c(\u03b70 ), \u03b4 = \u0131(\u03b70 ).

To avoid confusion we write X for the map \u0131(\u03c9) we have\nconstructed. Thus we have\n1\nX\u0131(P ) = 1 \u2212 T\n4\n(7.13)\nXc = c\u0131\nDualizing these equations we get\n(7.14)\n\n1\n\u2212\u0131(P )X \u2217 = 1 \u2212 S\n4\neX \u2217 = \u2212\uf6bee\n\nWe write (7.13) in matrix form.\n1\nX(\u0131(P ) c) = (1 \u2212 T c\u0131)\n4\nt\nLeft multiplication by (i(P ) \u2212 e) yields\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\ni(P )\n\u0131(P )\nX(\u0131(P ) c) =\n(1 \u2212 T c\u0131)\n\u2212e\n\u2212e\n4\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u2212 14 S\n(\u0131(P ) c)\n=\n\u2212\uf6bee\n\nSince (\u0131(P ) c) is injective we conclude\n\n1\n\u0131(P )(X) = 1 \u2212 S\n4\n\u2212eX = \u2212\uf6bee\nComparing with (7.14), and using that (\u0131(P ) \u2212 e) is surjective we conclude that\nindeed X \u2217 = \u2212X.\nWe finish the proof by noting that (3) follows immediately from (7.6).\n\u0003\nRemark 7.5. Assume that P and \u03c9 are compatible. We have unearthed quite a bit\nof structure in the diagram (7.1). I have not seen this type of structure at other\nplaces.\n(1) The diagram is (3, 2) periodic.\n(2) Denote the horizontal and vertical maps by h and v respectively. h and v\nsatisfy the following equations:\nhv = vh\n1\nv 2 + h3 = 1\n4\n\n\fNON-COMMUTATIVE QUASI-HAMILTONIAN SPACES\n\n21\n\n(3) Every 2 \u00d7 2 subdiagram is bicartesian.\n(4) The diagram is self dual up to a sign which must be applied to the vertical\nmaps.\nRemark 7.6.

In other words \u03c9\u0303 is\na unitary transformation of DA \u2295 \u03a9A . This suggest a connection with a noncommutative version of Dirac geometry (yet to be created). In the commutative\ncase this connection is well understood [4].\nPart (2) or Theorem 7.1 is proved in the same way as (1). It remains to prove\n(3), i.e. the equivalence between the integrability conditions on P and \u03c9.\nTo do this we may follow a similar method as in [14, Appendix]. We start by\nexpressing the integrability condition in terms of Hamiltonian vector fields (see\n\u00a72.3).

By lemma 7.2 we have that (\u0131(\u03c9), e) : DA \u2192 \u03a9A \u2295 A(d\u03a6)\u2217 A is injective.\nHence to check that \u03b4 \u2208 DA is zero it is sufficient to verify that \u0131\u03b4 (\u03c9) = 0 and\ne(\u03b4) = \u03b4(\u03a6)\u2032\u2032 (d\u03a6)\u2217 \u03b4(\u03a6)\u2032 = 0. The latter holds if \u03b4(\u03a6) = 0. The lemma now follows\nby writing (7.15) as \u03b4 \u2032 \u2297 \u03b4 \u2032\u2032 = 0 with \u03b4 \u2032 \u2208 DA and using Lemma 7.8.\n\u0003\nTo compute the part of (7.16) involving {{Ha , Hb }}l we may use the formula [14,\n(A.6)].\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\niHa LHb \u2212 \u03c412 LHb \u0131Ha = \u0131{{Ha ,Hb }}\u2032l \u2297 {{Ha , Hb }}l + {{Ha , Hb }}r \u2297 \u0131{{Ha ,Hb }}\u2032\u2032r\nHere L\u03b4 = di\u03b4 + i\u03b4 d and L\u03b4 = \u25e6 L\u03b4 . Applying the left hand side of this formula\nto \u03c9 we see that everything is computable except the term iHa \u0131Hb d\u03c9 appearing as\npart of iHa LHb (\u03c9). After a long and tedious computation we arrive at the following\nlemma.\nLemma 7.10.

By [14, Lemma A.5.2] we have \u0131(da) = Ha . Hence by (P3)\nwe have a\u2208A AHa A + AEA = DA .

In this section we show that the double quasi-Poisson brackets\nconstructed on (localized) path algebras of double quivers are non-degenerate and\nhence Theorem 7.1 applies to them.\nHowever first we note that for quivers it is more natural to use as base ring not\na field but a direct sum of fields indexed by the vertices. In [6] it was shown how\nto set up the theory over an arbitrary semi-simple base ring B. In [14] we worked\nover the base ring B = ke1 + * * * + ken with ep idempotent. Since we rely on results\nfrom [14] we will do the same in this section.\nSo assume that B is as in the previous paragraph. We use differentials and\npolyvector fields relative to B (relevant notations:P\u03a9A/B , \u03a9B A, DA/B , DB A). In\nthis setting the canonical element E is defined as p Ep where\n\nEp (a) = aep \u2297 ep \u2212 ep \u2297 ep a\nP\nA (multiplicative) moment map \u03a6 is now of the form p \u03a6p with \u03a6 \u2208 ep Aep . With\nthese conventions the definitions and results in this paper go through verbatim.\nWe will accept this without further discussion. For use below we introduce the\nfollowing convention. If c = ep Aeq then, changing standard terminology, an inverse\nof c is an element c\u22121 of eq Aep such that c * c\u22121 = ep , c\u22121 c = eq . It is easy to see\nthat c\u22121 is uniquely determined.\n\n\f24\n\nMICHEL VAN DEN BERGH\n\n8.2. Fusion. As in [14] our application to quivers depends on a process called\nfusion (introduced in the commutative case in [1]). In the case of quivers fusion\namounts to gluing vertices but it is beneficial to work somewhat generally. We\nfirst construct and algebra \u0100 from A by formally adjoining two variables e12 , e21\nsatisfying the usual matrix relations euv ewt = \u03b4wv eut (with eii = ei ). The fusion\nalgebra of A along e1 , e2 is defined as\nAf = \u01eb\u0100\u01eb\nwhere \u01eb = 1 \u2212 e2. Clearly \u0100 is a B\u0304-algebra and Af is a B f -algebra. We will identify\nB f with ke1 + ke3 + * * * + ken .\nIf a \u2208 A then we consider it as an element of \u0100 and we write af for \u01eba\u01eb + e12 ae21 .\nWe extend this convention to forms and polyvector fields. Note that in [14, \u00a75.3]\n \u0304 and (\u2212)f are compatible with the formation\nit was shown than the operations (\u2212)\nof DB A and its Schouten bracket. A similar result is true for \u03a9B A. The following\nresult was proved in [14]\nTheorem 8.2.1. [14, Thm 5.3.1, 5.3.2] Assume that (A, P, \u03a6) is a Hamiltonian double quasi-Poisson algebra (smooth as always). Then the same is true for\n(Af , P ff , \u03a6ff ) where\n(\n\u03a6f1 \u03a6f2 if i = 1\n1\nand\n\u03a6fif =\nP ff = P f \u2212 E1f E2f\n2\n\u03a6fi\nif i > 2\nIn this section we prove the following result.\nProposition 8.2.2. Assume that (A, P, \u03a6) is a non-degenerate Hamiltonian double\nquasi-Poisson algebra. Then the same is true for (Af , P ff , \u03a6ff ).\nProof. In order to avoid confusing notations we define Fp \u2208 DB f (Af ) for p 6= 2 by\nFp (a) = aep \u2297 ep \u2212 ep \u2297 ep a. It follows from [14, (5.3)] that\n(\nE1f + E2f if p = 1\n(8.1)\nFp =\nEpf\notherwise\nSince A is non-degenerate the following map is surjective\nX\n(\u0131(P ), c) : \u03a9A/B \u2295\nAEp A \u2192 DA/B\np\n\nFrom this we deduce (by base extension) that the following map is also surjective.\nX\n(\u0131(P\u0304 ), c) : \u03a9\u0100/B\u0304 \u2295\n\u0100\u0112p \u0100 \u2192 D\u0100/B\u0304\np\n\nBy [14, Prop 4.2.1, lemma A.5.2] we have\n(8.2)\n\n\u0131(P )(db) = \u2212{P, b}\n\nCompatibility of fusion with Schouten brackets yields that\nX\n(\u0131(P f ), c) : \u03a9Af /B f \u2295\n\u01eb\u0100\u0112p \u0100\u01eb \u2192 DAf /B f\np\n\nis also surjective. In addition we have \u01eb\u0100\u0112p \u0100\u01eb = Af Epf Af .\nIt follows easily that\nX\n(\u0131(P ff ), c) : \u03a9Af /B f \u2295\nAf Epf Af \u2192 DAf /B f\np\n\n\fNON-COMMUTATIVE QUASI-HAMILTONIAN SPACES\n\n25\n\nis surjective as well. Using (8.1) we see that the current proposition is proved\nprovided we can show that E1f is in the image of \u0131(P ff ), modulo (Fp )p . We do this\nnext. We have\n1\n\u0131(P ff )(d\u03a6f2 ) = \u2212{P f \u2212 E1f E2f , \u03a6f2 }\n2\nWe use some formulas we have already proved. I.e. the formula before [14, (5.5)]\nyields\n1\n{P f , \u03a6f2 } = \u2212 (E2f \u03a6f2 + \u03a6f2 E2f )\n2\n1\n= \u2212 ((F1 \u2212 E1f )\u03a6f2 + \u03a6f2 (F1 \u2212 E1f ))\n2\n1\n1\n= \u2212 (F1 \u03a6f2 + \u03a6f2 F1 ) + (E1f \u03a6f2 + \u03a6f2 E1f )\n2\n2\nWe also have (using the formulas after [14, (5.5)])\n{{E1f E2f , \u03a6f2 }} = E1f \u2217 {{E2f , \u03a6f2 }} \u2212 {{E1f , \u03a6f2 }} \u2217 E2f\n= E1f \u2217 (\u03a6f2 \u2297 e1 \u2212 e1 \u2297 \u03a6f2 )\n= \u03a6f2 \u2297 E1f \u2212 E1f \u2297 \u03a6f2\n(\"\u2217\" represents the inner bimodule structure) so that we get\n{E1f E2f , \u03a6f2 } = \u03a6f2 E1f \u2212 E1f \u03a6f2\nHence\n1\n1\n1\n1\n{P f \u2212 E1f E2f , \u03a6f2 } = \u2212 (F1 \u03a6f2 + \u03a6f2 F1 ) + (E1f \u03a6f2 + \u03a6f2 E1f ) \u2212 (\u03a6f2 E1f \u2212 E1f \u03a6f2 )\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\nf\nf\nf f\n= \u2212 (F1 \u03a62 + \u03a62 F1 ) + E1 \u03a62\n2\nSo we are done.\n\u0003\n8.3. Quivers. Below we assume that Q is a finite quiver whose vertices are indexed\nfrom 1 to n. We also use Q to refer to the set of arrows of Q. The head and tail of\nan arrow a are denoted by h(a), t(a) respectively.\nAssociated to Q is the double quiver which has the same vertices as Q and arrows\n{a, a\u2217 | a \u2208 Q} where h(a\u2217 ) = t(a), t(a\u2217 ) = h(a). It will be convenient to write\n(a\u2217 )\u2217 = a and to define for a \u2208 Q\u0304, \u01eb(a) = 1 if a \u2208 Q and \u01eb(a) = \u22121 otherwise. We\nlet A be the path algebra of k Q\u0304 to which we adjoin the inverses of 1 + aa\u2217 for all\na \u2208 Q\u0304.\nFor a \u2208 Q\u0304 one has a corresponding \"partial derivative\" in DA/B defined by\n(\n\u2202b\net(a) \u2297 eh(a) if a = b\n=\n\u2202a\n0\notherwise\nIt is easy to see that DA/B is a projective A-bimodule with generators \u2202/\u2202a \u2208\neh(a) DA/B et(a) .
