Coefficient algebras and transfer operators\n\n1\n\n2 Non-degenerate and complete transfer operators\n\n3\n\n3 Coefficient algebras associated with given endomorphisms\n\n8\n\n1\n\nIntroduction.\nCoefficient algebras and transfer operators\n\nThe notion of a coefficient algebra was introduced in [1] in connection with the study of\nextensions of C \u2217 -algebras by partial isometries. In this paper the authors investigated\nthe C \u2217 -algebra C \u2217 (A, V ) generated by a C \u2217 -algebra A \u2282 L(H) and a partial isometry\nV \u2208 L(H) such that the mapping A \u220b a 7\u2192 V aV \u2217 is an endomorphism of A. It was\nuncovered that this investigation can be carried out successfully if A and V satisfy the\nfollowing three conditions\nV a = V aV \u2217 V,\n\na \u2208 A;\n\n(1.1)\n\nV aV \u2217 \u2208 A,\n\na\u2208A\n\n(1.2)\n\nV \u2217 aV \u2208 A,\n\na \u2208 A.\n\n(1.3)\n\nand\n\nIn [1] the algebras possessing these properties were called the coefficient algebras (for\nC \u2217 (A, V )). This term was justified by the observation that any element in C \u2217 (A, V ) can\nbe presented as a Fourier like series with coefficients from A ([1], Theorems 2.7, 2.13).\n1\n\n\fIt was also shown ([1], Proposition 2.2) that if A contains the identity of L(H) then the\ncoefficient algebra can be equivalently defined by conditions (1.2), (1.3) along with the\ncondition\nV \u2217 V \u2208 Z(A)\n(1.4)\nwhere Z(A) is the center of A (it is worth mentioning that if A contains the identity then\nconditions (1.1), (1.2) and (1.3) automatically imply that V is a partial isometry and the\nmapping A \u220b a 7\u2192 V aV \u2217 is an endomorphism ([1], Proposition 2.2)).\nIn [1] there was also presented a certain procedure of constructing the coefficient\nalgebras starting from certain initial algebras that are not coefficient ones. Following this\nconstruction in [2] the maximal ideal space of the arising commutative coefficient algebras\n(in the situation when the initial algebra is commutative) was described. The development\nof this and other constructions, ideas and methods led to the general construction of\ncovariance (crossed product type) C \u2217 -algebra for partial dynamical system [3].\nThe interrelation between the coefficient algebras and various crossed product type\nstructures is not incidental. This is due to the fact that these algebras can also be\ndescribed by means of the so-called transfer operators. Here is the description. Using\n(1.4) and recalling that V is a partial isometry one obtains for any a, b \u2208 A the following\nrelations\nV \u2217 V aV \u2217 bV = aV \u2217 V V \u2217 bV = aV \u2217 bV.\n(1.5)\nIf we introduce the mappings\n\u03b4 : A \u2192 A,\n\n\u03b4(a) = V aV \u2217\n\n(1.6)\n\n\u03b4\u2217 : A \u2192 A,\n\n\u03b4\u2217 (a) = V \u2217 aV\n\n(1.7)\n\nand\nthen as it has been already observed \u03b4 is an endomorphism of A and (1.5) means that \u03b4\u2217\nis a linear positive mapping satisfying the condition\n\u03b4\u2217 (\u03b4(a)b) = a\u03b4\u2217 (b),\n\na, b \u2208 A.\n\n(1.8)\n\nThe mappings \u03b4\u2217 possessing the latter property were called by R. Exel [4] the transfer\noperators (for a given endomorphism \u03b4). It was shown in [4] that these objects play a\nsignificant role (they belong to the key constructive elements) in the theory of crossed\nproducts of C \u2217 -algebras by endomorphisms.\nNote that if any operator V satisfies the condition\nV \u2217 V aV \u2217 bV = aV \u2217 bV,\n\na, b \u2208 A\n\n(1.9)\n\na, b \u2208 A.\n\n(1.10)\n\nthen by passage to the adjoint we also obtain\nV \u2217 bV aV \u2217 V = V \u2217 bV a,\nRelations (1.9) and (1.10) imply in particular that\naV \u2217 V = V \u2217 V aV \u2217 V = V \u2217 V a\n2\n\n(1.11)\n\n\fthat is (1.4) is true. Thus the coefficient algebra can also be defined as an algebra satisfying\nconditions (1.2), (1.3) and (1.9). In other words a C \u2217 -algebra A \u2282 L(H) containing the\nidentity of L(H) is the coefficient algebra for C \u2217 (A, V ) iff the mapping \u03b4 (1.6) is an\nendomorphism and the mapping \u03b4\u2217 (1.7) is a transfer operator for \u03b4.\nThe foregoing reasoning shows on the one hand the importance of coefficient algebras\nin a number of fields and on the other hand one arrives at the natural problem: when a\ngiven C \u2217 -algebra is a coefficient algebra? The precise formulation of the problem is the\nfollowing.\nLet A be an (abstract) C \u2217 -algebra containing an identity and \u03b4 be an (abstract) endomorphism of A. Does there exist a triple (H, \u03c0, U) consisting of a Hilbert space H,\nfaithful non-degenerate representation \u03c0 : A \u2192 L(H) and a linear continuous operator\nU : H \u2192 H such that for every a \u2208 A the following conditions are satisfied\n\u03c0(\u03b4(a)) = U\u03c0(a)U \u2217 ,\n\nU \u2217 \u03c0(a)U \u2208 \u03c0(A)\n\n(1.12)\n\nand\nU\u03c0(a) = \u03c0(\u03b4(a))U?\n\n(1.13)\n\nThat is \u03c0(A) is the coefficient algebra for C \u2217 (\u03c0(A), U) under the fixed endomorphism\nU * U \u2217.\nThe answer to this problem is the theme of the present article.\nSince \u03b4 is an endomorphism it follows that \u03b4(1) is a projection and so (1.12) implies\nthat UU \u2217 is a projection, so U is a partial isometry. The above discussion means also\nthat instead of condition (1.13) one can use equivalently condition (1.4) or (1.9) (for \u03c0(a)\nand U respectively).\nThe article is organized as follows. In Section 2 we study some properties of transfer\noperators and in particular we establish the conditions of existence of the so-called complete transfer operators. By means of these operators in Section 3 we give the answer to\nthe problem stated above.\n\n2\n\nNon-degenerate and complete transfer operators\n\nLet A be a C \u2217 -algebra with an identity 1 and \u03b4 : A \u2192 A be an endomorphism of this\nalgebra. We start with recalling some definitions and facts concerning transfer operators.\nEverything henceforth up to Proposition 2.3 is borrowed from [4].\nA linear map \u03b4\u2217 : A \u2192 A is called a transfer operator for the pair (A, \u03b4) if it is\ncontinuous and positive an such that\n\u03b4\u2217 (\u03b4(a)b) = a\u03b4\u2217 (b),\n\na, b \u2208 A.\n\n(2.1)\n\nSince \u03b4\u2217 is positive it is self-adjoint an hence we have the symmetrized version of (2.1)\n\u03b4\u2217 (b\u03b4(a)) = \u03b4\u2217 (b)a.\nIn particular (2.1) and (2.2) imply that \u03b4\u2217 (A) is a two-sided ideal.\n3\n\n(2.2)\n\n\fBy (2.1) and (2.2) we also have that\na\u03b4\u2217 (1) = \u03b4\u2217 (\u03b4(a)1) = \u03b4\u2217 (1\u03b4(a)) = \u03b4\u2217 (1)a\n\n(2.3)\n\nfor all a \u2208 A, so \u03b4\u2217 (1) is a positive central element in A and \u03b4\u2217 (1)A is a two-sided ideal.\nIt is also worth mentioning that (2.1) and (2.2) imply\n\u03b4\u2217 ( * ) = \u03b4\u2217 (\u03b4(1) * ) = \u03b4\u2217 ( * \u03b4(1)).\n\n(2.4)\n\nProposition 2.1 ([4], Proposition 2.3) Let \u03b4\u2217 be a transfer operator for the pair (A, \u03b4).\nThen the following are equivalent:\n(i) the composition E = \u03b4 \u25e6 \u03b4\u2217 is a conditional expectation onto \u03b4(A),\n(ii) \u03b4 \u25e6 \u03b4\u2217 \u25e6 \u03b4 = \u03b4,\n(iii) \u03b4(\u03b4\u2217 (1)) = \u03b4(1).\nIf the equivalent conditions of Proposition 2.1 hold then R. Exel calls \u03b4\u2217 a nondegenerate transfer operator.\nProposition 2.2 ([4], Proposition 2.5) Let \u03b4\u2217 be a non-degenerate transfer operator.\nThen A may be written as the direct sum of ideals\nA = Ker \u03b4 \u2295 Im \u03b4\u2217\nProposition 2.3 ([4], Proposition 4.1) \u03b4(A) is a hereditary subalgebra of A iff \u03b4(A) =\n\u03b4(1)A\u03b4(1).\nRemark 2.4 If \u03b4 is given then in general a non-degenerate transfer operator \u03b4\u2217 (if it\nexists) is not defined in a unique way.\nExample. Let A = C(X) where X = R (mod 1) and let \u03b4 : A \u2192 A be given by the\nformula\n\u03b4(a)(x) = a(2x (mod 1)).\nTake any continuous function \u03c1 on X having the properties\n0 \u2264 \u03c1(x) \u2264 1,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n= 1 \u2212 \u03c1(x),\n\u03c1 x+\n2\n\nx \u2208 X,\n1\n0\u2264x\u2264 .\n2\n\nLet us define the operator \u03b4\u2217 on C(X) by the formula\n\u0012\u0014\n\u0015\u0013 \u0012\u0014\n\u0015\u0013\n\u0010x\u0011 \u0010x\u0011\nx 1\nx 1\n\u03c1\n+a\n\u03c1\n,\n+\n+\n\u03b4\u2217 (a)(x) = a\n2\n2\n2 2\n2 2\nwhere [x] = x (mod 1). Clearly for any \u03c1 chosen \u03b4\u2217 is a transfer operator for \u03b4 and since\n\u03b4\u2217 (1) = 1 it is non-degenerate.\nNow we note that the non-degeneracy of transfer operators also implies some additional\nproperties.\n4\n\n\fProposition 2.5 Let \u03b4\u2217 be a non-degenerate transfer operator. Then\n1) \u03b4\u2217 (1) is an orthogonal projection lying in the center of A,\n2) \u03b4\u2217 (A) = \u03b4\u2217 (1)A.\n3) \u03b4\u2217 : \u03b4(A) \u2192 \u03b4\u2217 (A) is a \u2217 -isomorphism (the inverse to the \u2217 -isomorphism \u03b4 : \u03b4\u2217 (A) \u2192\n\u03b4(A)).\nProof. 1) It has been already observed that \u03b4\u2217 (1) is a central element in A so it is\nenough to show that it is a projection.\nBy Proposition 2.2 we have that\nA = Ker \u03b4 \u2295 Im \u03b4\u2217 .\nThus the mapping\n\u03b4 : Im \u03b4\u2217 \u2192 \u03b4(A)\n\n(2.5)\n\nis a \u2217 -isomorphism and so the mapping\n\u03b4 \u22121 : \u03b4(A) \u2192 Im \u03b4\u2217\n\n(2.6)\n\nis a \u2217 -isomorphism as well.\nSince \u03b4\u2217 is non-degenerate it follows from (iii) of Proposition 2.1 that\n\u03b4(\u03b4\u2217 (1)) = \u03b4(1).\n\n(2.7)\n\nNow (2.6) and (2.7) imply\n\u03b4\u2217 (1) = \u03b4 \u22121 (\u03b4(1)).\nSince \u03b4(1) is a projection (as \u03b4 is an endomorphism) and \u03b4 \u22121 is a morphism it follows that\n\u03b4 \u22121 (\u03b4(1)) is a projection as well. So 1) is proved.\n2) Using (2.2) we obtain\n\u03b4\u2217 (1)A = \u03b4\u2217 (1\u03b4(A)) \u2282 \u03b4\u2217 (A).\n\n(2.8)\n\nIn view of the non-degeneracy of \u03b4\u2217 and (iii) of Proposition 2.1 we have\n\u03b4(\u03b4\u2217 (1)A) = \u03b4(\u03b4\u2217 (1)) * \u03b4(A) = \u03b4(1)\u03b4(A) = \u03b4(A).\n\n(2.9)\n\nNow we conclude from (2.8), (2.5) and (2.9) that the mapping\n\u03b4 : \u03b4\u2217 (1)A \u2192 \u03b4(A)\n\n(2.10)\n\nis a \u2217 -isomorphism (we have already noticed that \u03b4\u2217 (1)A is an ideal (recall (2.3))). Therefore (2.10) and (2.5) imply the equality \u03b4\u2217 (1)A = \u03b4\u2217 (A) and the proof of 2) is finished.\n3) For any a \u2208 A we have that \u03b4(a) \u2208 \u03b4(A) and \u03b4\u2217 \u03b4(a) \u2208 \u03b4\u2217 (A), and \u03b4\u03b4\u2217 \u03b4(a) = \u03b4(a)\nby Proposition 2.1 (ii). Therefore \u03b4\u2217 : \u03b4(A) \u2192 \u03b4\u2217 (A) is a right inverse to \u03b4 : \u03b4\u2217 (A) \u2192 \u03b4(A).\nBut since it has been already observed that \u03b4 : \u03b4\u2217 (A) \u2192 \u03b4(A) is an isomorphism it follows\nthat \u03b4\u2217 is an isomorphism as well. \u0003\n\n5\n\n\fProposition 2.6 Let A be a C \u2217 -algebra with an identity 1, \u03b4 : A \u2192 A be an endomorphism of A and \u03b4\u2217i , i = 1, 2 be two non-degenerate transfer operators for (A, \u03b4). Then\n1) \u03b4\u22171 (1) = \u03b4\u22172 (1),\n2) \u03b4\u22171 (A) = \u03b4\u22172 (A).\nProof. By 1) of Proposition 2.5 we have that \u03b4\u2217i (1), i = 1, 2 are the orthogonal\nprojections belonging to the center of A. Set\nP = \u03b4\u22171 (1)\u03b4\u22172 (1).\nBy 1) of Proposition 2.5 we have\nP \u2208 \u03b4\u2217i (A),\n\ni = 1, 2,\n\n(2.11)\n\nand by the non-degeneracy of \u03b4\u2217i , i = 1, 2 (see (iii) of Proposition 2.1) we obtain\n\u03b4(P ) = \u03b4(\u03b4\u22171 (1)\u03b4\u22172 (1)) = \u03b4(\u03b4\u22171 (1))\u03b4(\u03b4\u22172 (1)) = \u03b4(1)\u03b4(1) = \u03b4(1).\n\n(2.12)\n\nBut in view of Proposition 2.2 the mappings\n\u03b4 : \u03b4\u2217i (A) \u2192 \u03b4(A),\n\ni = 1, 2\n\n(2.13)\n\nare \u2217 -isomorphisms. Now (2.11), (2.12) and (2.13) imply\nP = \u03b4\u22171 (1) = \u03b4\u22172 (1).\nSince by 1) \u03b4\u22171 (1) = \u03b4\u22172 (1) we conclude by 2) of Proposition 2.5 that \u03b4\u22171 (A) = \u03b4\u22172 (A).\nThe proof is complete. \u0003\nRemark 2.7 It has been observed that in general a non-degenerate transfer operator (for\na given pair (A, \u03b4)) is not unique. Part 2) of Proposition 2.6 and part 3) of Proposition\n2.5 tell us that nevertheless its restriction onto \u03b4(A) is unique.\nWe shall call the transfer operator \u03b4\u2217 complete, if\n\u03b4\u03b4\u2217 (a) = \u03b4(1)a\u03b4(1),\n\na \u2208 A.\n\n(2.14)\n\nObserve that a complete transfer operator is non-degenerate. Indeed, (2.14) implies\n\u03b4\u03b4\u2217 \u03b4(a) = \u03b4(1)\u03b4(a)\u03b4(1) = \u03b4(a)\nand so condition (ii) of Proposition 2.1 is satisfied.\nNote also that (2.14) implies\n\u03b4\u2217 \u03b4\u03b4\u2217 = \u03b4\u2217 .\n\n(2.15)\n\nThe next result presents the criteria for the existence of a complete transfer operator.\n\n6\n\n\fTheorem 2.8 Let A be a C \u2217 -algebra with an identity 1 and \u03b4 : A \u2192 A be an endomorphism of A. The following are equivalent:\n1) there exists a complete transfer operator \u03b4\u2217 (for (A, \u03b4)),\n2) (i) there exists a non-degenerate transfer operator \u03b4\u2217 and\n(ii) \u03b4(A) is a hereditary subalgebra of A;\n3) (i) there exists a central orthogonal projection P \u2208 A such that\na) \u03b4(P ) = \u03b4(1),\nb) the mapping \u03b4 : P A \u2192 \u03b4(A) is a \u2217 -isomorphism, and\n(ii) \u03b4(A) = \u03b4(1)A\u03b4(1).\nMoreover the objects in 1) \u2013 3) are defined in a unique way (i. e. the transfer operator \u03b4\u2217\nin 1) and 2) is unique and the projection P in 3) is unique as well) and\nP = \u03b4\u2217 (1)\n\n(2.16)\n\n\u03b4\u2217 (a) = \u03b4 \u22121 (\u03b4(1)a\u03b4(1)), a \u2208 A\n\n(2.17)\n\nand\nwhere \u03b4 \u22121 : \u03b4(A) \u2192 P A is the inverse mapping to \u03b4 : P A \u2192 \u03b4(A).\nProof. 1) \u21d2 2). By Proposition 2.3 2) (ii) and 3) (ii) are equivalent.\nWe have already noticed that if \u03b4\u2217 is complete then it is non-degenerate. Moreover\n(2.14) implies\n\u03b4(A) \u2283 \u03b4(1)A\u03b4(1)\nand on the other hand\n\u03b4(A) = \u03b4(1)\u03b4(A)\u03b4(1) \u2282 \u03b4(1)A\u03b4(1).\nThus 1) implies 2).\n2) \u21d2 3). We have already noticed that 2) (ii) and 3) (ii) are equivalent.\nSet P = \u03b4\u2217 (1). By 1) of Proposition 2.5 P is an orthogonal central projection, and by\n(iii) of Proposition 2.1 \u03b4(P ) = \u03b4(1). So 3) (i) (a) is true.\nBy 2) of Proposition 2.5 we have that \u03b4\u2217 (A) = P A and it follows from Proposition 2.2\nthat the mapping \u03b4 : P A \u2192 \u03b4(A) is a \u2217 -isomorphism. So 3) (i) (b) is true.\n3) \u21d2 1). Let \u03b4 \u22121 : \u03b4(A) \u2192 P A be the inverse mapping to \u03b4 : P A \u2192 \u03b4(A). Define\nthe operator \u03b4\u2217 by the formula \u03b4\u2217 (a) = \u03b4 \u22121 (\u03b4(1)a\u03b4(1)). Clearly \u03b4\u2217 is positive and satisfies\n(2.14). Note that\n\u0001\n\u03b4 \u03b4\u2217 (\u03b4(a)b) = \u03b4(1)\u03b4(a)b\u03b4(1) = \u03b4(a)\u03b4(1)b\u03b4(1) = \u03b4(a\u03b4\u2217 (b)).\n\nBut in view of the definition of \u03b4\u2217 the elements \u03b4\u2217 (\u03b4(a)b) and a\u03b4\u2217 (b) belong to the ideal\nP A where the endomorphism \u03b4 is injective. Therefore they coincide and thus (2.1) is\nproved. So \u03b4\u2217 is a complete transfer operator.\n\n7\n\n\fNow to finish the proof let us verify the uniqueness of the objects mentioned in 1) \u2013 3).\nThe uniqueness of the projection P in 3) is in fact established in 1) of Proposition 2.6\n(since here we have P = \u03b4\u2217 (1) for some non-degenerate \u03b4\u2217 which also proves (2.16)).\nRecalling (2.4) we obtain\n\u03b4\u2217 (a) = \u03b4\u2217 (\u03b4(1)a\u03b4(1)), a \u2208 A.\n\n(2.18)\n\nBut by 3) (ii) \u03b4(1)a\u03b4(1) \u2208 \u03b4(A). Therefore (2.18) and 3) of Proposition 2.5 imply the\nuniqueness of \u03b4\u2217 .\nFinally we note that formula (2.17) has been already proven in the course of the proof\nof 3) \u21d2 1).\nThe proof is complete. \u0003\nIn connection with Theorem 2.8 it makes sense to note the next useful observation\nwhich is given in Proposition 2.9. We recall that a partial automorphism of a C \u2217 -algebra\nA is a triple (\u03b8, I, J) where I and J are closed two-sided ideals of A and \u03b8 : I \u2192 J is a\n\u2217\n-isomorphism.\nProposition 2.9 Let \u03b4\u2217 be a complete transfer operator for (A, \u03b4) and \u03b4(1) \u2208 Z(A), then\n1) both the triples (\u03b4, \u03b4\u2217 (1)A, \u03b4(1)A) and (\u03b4\u2217 , \u03b4(1)A, \u03b4\u2217(1)A) are partial automorphisms (that are inverses to each other), and\n2) \u03b4\u2217 : A \u2192 A is an endomorphism.\nProof. 1) By Proposition 2.5 we have that \u03b4\u2217 (1) is a central projection. Since\nby the condition of the lemma \u03b4(1) is a central projection as well it follows that both\n\u03b4\u2217 (1)A and \u03b4(1)A are the ideals. In addition by 3) (ii) of Theorem 2.8 we have that\n\u03b4(A) = \u03b4(1)A\u03b4(1) = \u03b4(1)A. Now 1) follows from Proposition 2.5.\n2) Using (2.17) and the condition that \u03b4(1) \u2208 Z(A) and recalling that \u03b4\u2217 : \u03b4(A) \u2192\n\u03b4\u2217 (A) is a \u2217 -isomorphism we obtain for any a, b \u2208 A\n\u03b4\u2217 (ab) = \u03b4 \u22121 (\u03b4(1)ab\u03b4(1)) = \u03b4 \u22121 (\u03b4(1)a\u03b4(1)\u03b4(1)b\u03b4(1))\n= \u03b4 \u22121 (\u03b4(1)a\u03b4(1)) \u03b4 \u22121(\u03b4(1)b\u03b4(1)) = \u03b4\u2217 (a)\u03b4\u2217 (b).\nThus \u03b4\u2217 : A \u2192 A is an endomorphism. \u0003\n\n3\n\nCoefficient algebras associated with given\nendomorphisms\n\nNow we pass to the main result of the article.\nLet A be a C \u2217 -algebra containing an identity 1 and \u03b4 : A \u2192 A be an endomorphism.\nWe say that A is a coefficient algebra associated with \u03b4 if there exists a triple (H, \u03c0, U)\nconsisting of a Hilbert space H, faithful non-degenerate representation \u03c0 : A \u2192 L(H)\nand a linear continuous operator U : H \u2192 H such that conditions (1.12) and (1.13) are\nsatisfied.\nTheorem 3.1 A is a coefficient algebra associated with \u03b4 iff there exists a complete transfer operator \u03b4\u2217 for (A, \u03b4) (that is either of the equivalent conditions of Theorem 2.8 hold).\n8\n\n\fProof. Necessity.\nwith \u03c0(A)) one can set\n\nIf conditions (1.12) and (1.13) are satisfied then (identifying A\n\u03b4\u2217 (*) = U \u2217 (*)U\n\nand it is easy to verify that \u03b4\u2217 is a complete transfer operator.\nSufficiency. Let \u03b4\u2217 be a complete transfer operator. We shall construct the desired\nHilbert space H by means of the lements of the initial algebra A in the following way.\nLet h * , * i be a certain non-negative inner product on A (differing from a common inner\nproduct only in such a way that for certain non-zero elements v \u2208 A the expression hv, vi\nmay be equal to zero). For example this inner product may have the form hv, ui = f (u\u2217 v)\nwhere f is some positive linear functional on A. If one factorizes A by all the elements v\nsuch that hv, vi = 0 then he obtains a linear space with a strictly positive inner\np product.\nWe shall call the completion of this space with respect to the norm kvk = hv, vi the\nHilbert space generated by the inner product h * , * i.\nLet V be the set of all positive\nlinear functionals on A. The space H will be the\nL\nf\ncompletion of the direct sum\nH f . Every H f will in\nf \u2208V H of some Hilbert spaces\nL\nturn be the completion of the direct sum of Hilbert spaces n\u2208Z Hnf . The spaces Hnf are\ngenerated by non-negative inner products h * , * in on the initial algebra A that are given\nby the following formulae\nhv, ui0 = f (u\u2217 v);\n\n(3.1)\n\nhv, uin = f \u03b4\u2217n (u\u2217 v) ,\n\u0001\n\nn \u2265 0;\n\n\u0001\nhv, uin = f u\u2217 \u03b4 |n| (1)v ,\n\nn \u2264 0.\n\n(3.2)\n(3.3)\n\nThe properties of these inner products are described in the next\nLemma 3.2 For any v, u \u2208 A the following equalities are true\nh\u03b4(v), uin+1 = hv, \u03b4\u2217 (u)in ,\n\nn \u2265 0;\n\nh\u03b4 |n| (1)v, uin+1 = hv, \u03b4 |n| (1)uin ,\n\nn < 0.\n\n(3.4)\n(3.5)\n\nProof. Indeed, the proof of (3.4) reduces to the verification of the equality\n\u03b4\u2217n+1 (u\u2217 \u03b4(v)) = \u03b4\u2217n (\u03b4\u2217 (u\u2217 )v)\nwhich follows from (2.2), and the proof of (3.5) reduces to the verification of the equality\nu\u2217 \u03b4 |n|\u22121(1)\u03b4 |n| (1)v = u\u2217 \u03b4 |n| (1)\u03b4 |n|(1)v\nwhich follows from the equalities\n\u03b4 |n|\u22121(1)\u03b4 |n| (1) = \u03b4 |n|\u22121(1 * \u03b4(1)) = \u03b4 |n| (1) = (\u03b4 |n| (1))2 . \u0003\nNow let us define the operators U and U \u2217 on the space H constructed.

Then for\nn < 0 we have\nU \u2217 \u03c0(a)Uhn = \u03b4 |n| (1)\u03b4 |n|\u22121(a)\u03b4 |n| (1)hn ,\n\u03c0(\u03b4\u2217 (a))hn = \u03b4 |n| (\u03b4\u2217 (a))hn = \u03b4 |n| (1)\u03b4 |n|\u22121(a)\u03b4 |n| (1)hn\n(where the final equality follows from (2.14)); and for n \u2265 0 we have\n\u03c0(\u03b4\u2217 (a))hn = \u03b4\u2217 (a)hn ,\nU \u2217 \u03c0(a)Uhn = \u03b4\u2217 (a\u03b4(hn )) = \u03b4\u2217 (a)hn .\n\n10\n\n\fIn addition for n \u2264 0 one has\n\u03c0(\u03b4(a))hn = \u03b4 |n|+1(a)hn ,\nU\u03c0(a)U \u2217 hn = \u03b4 |n|+1(1)\u03b4 |n|+1(a)\u03b4 |n|+1(1)hn = \u03b4 |n|+1 (a)hn ;\nand for n > 0\n\u03c0(\u03b4(a))hn = \u03b4(a)hn ,\nU\u03c0(a)U \u2217 hn = \u03b4(a\u03b4\u2217 (hn )) = \u03b4(a)hn \u03b4(1),\nand moreover (3.2) and (2.2) imply that for n > 0 the element \u03b4(a)hn \u03b4(1) coincides with\n\u03b4(a)hn in the space Hnf .\nThus we have proved that U\u03c0(a)U \u2217 = \u03c0(\u03b4(a)) and U \u2217 \u03c0(a)U = \u03c0(\u03b4\u2217 (a)) for any a \u2208 A.\nTo finish the proof it is enough to observe the faithfulness of the representation \u03c0. But\nthis follows from the definition of the inner product in (3.1), the definition of \u03c0 (see the\nsecond line in the diagram) and the standard Gelfand-Naimark faithful representation of\na C \u2217 -algebra. The proof is complete. \u0003\nWe shall say that an endomorphism \u03b4 : A \u2192 A is generated by an isometry if\nthere exists a triple (H, \u03c0, U) consisting of a Hilbert space H, faithful non-degenerate\nrepresentation \u03c0 : A \u2192 L(H) and an isometry U : H \u2192 H such that for every a \u2208 A the\nfollowing conditions are satisfied\n\u03c0(\u03b4(a)) = U\u03c0(a)U \u2217 ,\n\nU \u2217 \u03c0(a)U \u2208 \u03c0(A).\n\n(3.9)\n\nTheorem 3.1 implies in particular an obvious\nCorollary 3.3 An endomorphism \u03b4 is generated by an isometry iff there exists a complete\ntransfer operator \u03b4\u2217 for (A, \u03b4) such that \u03b4\u2217 (1) = 1 or, equivalently iff \u03b4 is a monomorphism\nwith hereditary range.\nProof. Evidently \u03b4 is generated by an isometry iff A is a coefficient algebra associated\nwith \u03b4 and we have U \u2217 U = 1. So in this case \u03b4\u2217 (1) = 1 and the projection P mentioned\nin 3) of Theorem 2.8 is equal to 1. \u0003\n\nReferences\n[1] A. V. Lebedev, A.
