Wide ranging observations provide a wealth\nof information for examining the relation between dark\nand visible matter and their radial profiles. Unlike galaxies,\nwhere substantial cooling is predicted to have concentrated\nbaryons in the centres of DM halos, clusters are observed to\ncool relatively inefficiently via thermal emission so that the\ngas remains close to the virial temperature, making cluster\nmass profiles easy to interpret, as corrections for gas cooling\nare not significant (Blumenthal et al. 1986; Broadhurst &\nBarkana 2008).\nLensing work is now able to achieve measurements of\n\u22c6\n\nBased on data collected at Subaru Telescope and obtained from\nthe SMOKA, which is operated by the Astronomy Data Center,\nNational Astronomical Observatory of Japan.\n\u2020 elinor@wise.tau.ac.il\n\nprojected cluster mass profiles with unprecedented detail,\nsufficient to usefully address the distinctive prediction of\na relatively shallow mass profiles for CDM dominated halos (Navarro, Frenk & White, 1997, hereafter NFW; Duffy\net al., 2008). Combined weak and strong lensing measurements have shown that the continuously steepening form of\nthe NFW profile is a reasonable description for the mass\nprofiles of three careful, independent studies (Kneib et al.\n2003; Gavazzi 2005; Broadhurst et al. 2005), although with\nsurprisingly high values derived for the profile concentration parameter in each case (Broadhurst et al. 2005). More\nrecently, the concordance \u039bCDM cosmology has been examined critically with a somewhat larger sample of clusters,\nindicating that the concentrations derived are significantly\nhigher than predicted over a wide range of cluster mass, after\naccounting for statistical corrections for lensing-induced biases. This is seen both in terms of the size of the Einstein radius (Broadhurst & Barkana 2008; Oguri & Blandford 2009;\nZitrin et al. 2009) and the weak lensing (WL) mass profiles\nof several well known clusters (Broadhurst et al. 2008; Sadeh\n& Rephaeli 2008; Lapi & Cavaliere 2009).\n\n\f2\n\nE. Medezinski et al.\n\nCurrent detailed cluster mass and light profiles can now\nbe used to examine the ratio of M/L all the way out to the\nvirial radius. Comparisons of the general DM distribution\nwith the galaxy distribution are potentially of great interest\nas the distribution of galaxies is thought to be influenced by\nsignificant tidal forces which may substantially modify massive galaxy halos reducing their masses (Ghigna et al. 1998,\n2000; Col\u0131\u0301n et al. 1999; Springel et al. 2001; De Lucia et al.\n2004; Gao et al. 2004; Nagai & Kravtsov 2005; Limousin\net al. 2009). Mass loss calculated over Hubble time in \u039bCDM\npredict losses of \u223c 30% for orbits extending to the virial radius, with typically a loss of \u223c 70% near cluster centres, so\nthat the ratio of integrated galaxy mass to the general DM\ndistribution falls steadily towards the cluster centre (Nagai\n& Kravtsov 2005).\nStars are not expected to be stripped significantly in\nthese simulations because of their location deep in the central potential of a galaxy. Hence, for clusters the galaxy light\nshould simply trace mass, assuming both are collisionless, so\nthat a fairly constant M/L is expected (Gao et al. 2004; Nagai & Kravtsov 2005). The presence of high-mass galaxies in\nthe inner core, resulting from both higher merger rates and\nthe effect of dynamical friction, explains the reduced value\nof the integrated M/L ratio within a radius of 6 200h\u22121 kpc\nfor the highest mass clusters (Nagai & Kravtsov 2005; ElZant, Shlosman & Hoffman 2001).\nReliable M/L profiles of galaxy clusters have begun to\nemerge recently based on dynamical (Rines et al. 2000, 2004)\nand lensing based methods (Medezinski et al. 2007). For the\nlocal cluster A576, a careful dynamically-based M/L profile\nhas been obtained with caustic work by (Rines et al. 2000),\nwho note a puzzling declining behavior, with a peak around\nM/L \u223c 600M/LR at r \u223c 100h\u22121 kpc, declining to a limiting\n100M/LB , at r \u223c 1h\u22121 Mpc and beyond. Other dynamical\nestimates from stacking together samples of clusters also\nshow this overall behavior, where the M/L ratio may peak\naround 10% of the virial radius (Katgert, Biviano & Mazure\n2004) and declines thereafter (Rines et al. 2000, 2004).\nOur earlier lensing based determination of the M/L profile of A1689 (Medezinski et al. 2007) shows behaviour similar to the above dynamical work, with a peak of M/LB \u223c\n400(M/L)\u2299 at r \u223c 100h\u22121 kpc, and a steady decline to\n\u223c 100M/LB at the virial radius, r \u223c 2h\u22121 Mpc (Medezinski et al. 2007). In the case of A576 (Rines et al. 2000) and\nin our own work on A1689 (Medezinski et al. 2007), careful corrections are made for the trend of M/L of the stellar\npopulation with cluster radius, using the measured colours\nof cluster member galaxies which favour predominately redder, earlier-type galaxies in the central region. In both these\ndiffering analyses the colour trend was found to be weak and\nnot nearly sufficient to account for the measured variation of\nthe M/L profile, leaving a puzzling result which is generally\nat odds with the known result that M/L is an increasing\nfunction of scale. Clearly, it is important to extend the investigation of the M/L profile to more clusters to examine\nthe generality of our earlier work and to examine possible\ntrends with other observables in a more statistically robust\nway.\nOur previous work demonstrated the importance of\ncarefully selecting a background population to avoid contamination by the lensing cluster. It is not sufficient to simply exclude a narrow band containing the obvious E/S0 se-\n\nquence, following common practice, because the lensing signal of the remainder bluer objects is found to fall rapidly\ntowards the cluster centre relative to the background of red\nlensed galaxies indicating that unlensed cluster members are\npresent blueward of the sequence diluting the true lensing\nsignal (Broadhurst et al. 2005). Due to this effect, many WL\nstudies have underestimated the masses and concentrations\nof cluster mass profiles (Lu et al. 2009), a point now widely\nacknowledged (Limousin et al. 2007; Oguri et al. 2009; Okabe et al. 2009). This effect resolved the long standing discrepancy between the strong and WL effects, with the WL\nsignal underpredicting the observed Einstein radius by a factor of \u223c 2.5 (Clowe & Schneider 2001; Bardeau et al. 2005),\nbased only on a minimal rejection of obvious cluster members using one or two-band photometry. Red background\ngalaxies behind clusters have since been explored carefully\nwith deep wide-field spectroscopy by Rines & Geller (2008),\nwho emphasize that the red population in their cluster data\ncomprises exclusively background objects.\nThis lensing \"dilution\" effect may be turned to our advantage as a means of correcting the cluster population for\nbackground contamination, extending the work of Medezinski et al. (2007). Here we analyze very high quality Subaru\nimages of A1703, A370, & RXJ1347-11 for which we have accurate WL measurements. For these clusters, a wider range\nof colours is available than for A1689, which we make full use\nhere to improve the separation of cluster members from foreground and background populations using the colour-colour\n(CC) diagram and application of our dilution method. Using the dilution method has the advantage that it does not\nrequire the actual subtraction of background galaxies which\nintroduces the inherent uncertainty caused by the clustering\nof the background signal and the attendant requirement for\nthe accurate photometry of control fields.\nIn \u00a7 2 we present the cluster observations, the data reduction, and in \u00a7 3 we explain how we select cluster galaxies,\nbackground samples, and foreground samples. In \u00a7 4 we examine evolutionary tracks to reinforce the sample selection\ncriteria, and compare with blank-field surveys to determine\nredshift distributions in \u00a7 5. In \u00a7 6 we describe the WL analysis, and in \u00a7 7 we describe how the WL measurements are\nused to determine the cluster fraction using our WL dilution\nmethod. In \u00a7 8 we derive the light profile of each cluster, and\ncompare with the mass profile to obtain the M/L profile in\n\u00a7 9. In \u00a7 10 we investigate the shape and variation of the\ncluster luminosity functions (LF) and its radial dependence.\nFinally, we summarize our findings in \u00a7 11.\nThe \u039bCDM cosmological model is adopted, with \u03a9M =\n0.3, and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, but with h left in units of H0 /100 km\ns\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , for easier comparison with earlier work.\n\n2\n\nSUBARU DATA REDUCTION\n\nWe analyze deep images of three intermediate-redshift clusters, A1703 (z = 0.258), A370 (z = 0.375) and RXJ1347-11\n(z = 0.451), observed with the wide-field camera SuprimeCam (Miyazaki et al. 2002) in several optical bands, at the\nprime focus of the 8.3m Subaru telescope. The cluster A1703\nwas observed on 2007 June 15 and the WL signal analyzed\nby Broadhurst et al. (2008) and Oguri et al. (2009).

In the case of A1703\nand A370, no standard star observations were available, so\nzeropoints were derived independently in similar passbands\nby comparing to magnitudes of stars observed in SDSS fields\n(Oguri et al. 2009). Conversions from SDSS g, r bands to\nSubaru B, RC bands were done using the relations given\nin Lupton (2005) for the SDSS. For RXJ1347-11, standard\nstars observed during the observation nights were used to derive photometric zeropoints in the B, RC and z \u2032 bands. For\nthe z'-band only three Standard stars were unsaturated in\nthe Subaru image. To better constrain the z'-band, and as a\nconsistency check for the BJ & RC -bands, unsaturated stars\nwere compared with the HST /ACS images of RXJ1347-11\nin the F 475W, F 814W & F 850LP filters, finding good consistency to within \u00b10.05 mag.\nSAMPLE SELECTION FROM THE\nCOLOUR-COLOUR DIAGRAM\n\nFor each cluster we use Subaru observations in three broadbands, which differ in their choice of passbands between the\nclusters, though all observations are deep and taken in conditions of good seeing, representing some of the highest quality\n1\n\n26.5\n25.9\n27.4\n26.9\n26.1\n27.4\n26.9\n26.1\n26.5\n26.7\n25.5\n\non Broadhurst et al.

Using three bands in terms of\ntwo-colour space for object selection will help separate different populations and improve subsequent WL and light\nmeasurements of the cluster, as we now demonstrate.\n\n3.1\n\nCluster Members\n\nFor all three clusters we construct a CC diagram and first\nidentify in this space where the cluster lies. We do this by\ncalculating the mean distance of all objects from the cluster\ncentre in a given CC cell, as shown in Fig. 1. This turns out\nto be a very clear way of finding the cluster as the mean radius is markedly lower in a well defined region of CC space\nfor each cluster (region of bluer (darker) colours, the approximate boundary of which is marked in black). This small\nregion clearly corresponds to an overdensity of galaxies in\nCC space comprising the red sequence of each cluster and\na blue trail of later type cluster members (Fig. 2, dashed\nwhite curve). Of course, some background galaxies must also\nbe expected in this region of CC space, and the proportion\nof these will be established in \u00a7 7 by looking at their WL\nsignal \u2013 which should be consistent with zero in the case of\nno background contamination. In general, a positive signal\nwill be expected at some level, in proportion to the fraction\nof lensed background galaxies occupying that same region\nof CC space as the cluster. Indeed, it is clear that the level\nof the tangential distortion seen in Fig. 6 is consistent with\nzero almost to the outskirts of each cluster radial span, and\nonly rises to meet the background level at large radius where\nthe proportion of cluster members is small compared with\nthe background counts. In Fig. 1 (black curve), in Fig. 2\n(dashed white curve) and in Fig. 3 (left panels, green points)\nwe mark the boundaries of this region, selected relative to\nthe red sequence in this CC space, and conservatively to\nsafely encompass the region occupied by the cluster.\nThe above sample, which includes all cluster member\ngalaxies, we term the \"green\" sample, as distinct from the\nwell separated populations of red and bluer galaxies discussed below (Fig. 3, left panels). In defining this green\nsample we apply a magnitude limit of m \u2243 26.5 in the\n\n\fE.

Number density in CC space for A1703, A370 &\nRXJ1347-11 (Top to bottom). The four distinct density peaks\n(seen especially in the A370 plot) are shown to be different galaxy\npopulations - the reddest peak in the upper right corner of the\nplots (dashed white line) depicts the overdensity of cluster galaxies, whose colours are lying on the red sequence; the middle peak\nwith colours bluer than the cluster shows the overdensity of foreground galaxies; the two peaks in the bottom part (bluest in\nB \u2212 R) can be demonstrated to comprise of blue and red (left\nand right, respectively) background galaxies.\n\n\fMass and Light profiles of A1703, A370& RXJ1347-11\n3.2\n\nRed Background Galaxies\n\nThe mean radius used above is useful for locating the cluster in CC space but does not help in the definition of\nbackground or foreground galaxy populations, which are of\ncourse relatively uniform over the field of view, apart from\nthe relatively small magnification bias which tends to deplete the number of red background galaxies towards the\ncentre of mass, as described in Broadhurst et al. (2008) and\nis visible here in Fig. 3 (central panels, black squares) as a\ndecrease in number counts towards the centre.\nTo define the foreground and background populations\nwe look instead at the combination of the WL signal and the\ndistribution of galaxies in the CC plane. For each cluster, we\nsee a dense cloud of red objects (Fig. 2, lower right overdensity). This is particularly obvious for A370 where we have\nthe widest wavelength coverage, BJ , RC & z \u2032 . The cloud is\nrelatively red in RC \u2212 z \u2032 but blue in BJ \u2212 RC , so very well\nseparated from the cluster member region defined above.\nThis red cloud is known from wide-field survey work (Capak\net al. 2007) and established to comprise early- to mid-type\ngalaxies spanning a broad redshift range, 0.5 < z < 2, as\ndiscussed below (\u00a7 5).\nFor this red sample we define a conservative diagonal\nboundary relative to the red sequence as for the green sample (see Fig. 3, left panels, red points), to safely avoid contamination by cluster members and also foreground galaxies as discussed below (see \u00a7 3.3). We can check if there is\nany significant contamination of this red sample by unlensed\ngalaxies by measuring the WL amplitude of these red galaxies as a function of distance from this boundary. As shown in\nFig. 6 (red triangles), no evidence of dilution of the lensing\nsignal is visible. We also define a blue colour limit to separate this red population from what appears to be a distinct\ndensity maximum of very blue objects \u2013 the so called \"blue\ncloud\" (see Fig. 2, in the extreme blue corner of CC space\n(see below \u00a7 3.3). We further limit the red sample to m < 26\nAB mag in the reddest band for each cluster to avoid incompleteness and so that we can rely on good detections in all\nbands when defining our colour samples.\nThe boundaries of the red sample as defined above are\nmarked on Fig. 3 (red points), and can be seen to lie well\naway from the \"green\" cluster sample previously defined\n(green points). For this red sample a clearly rising WL signal\nis seen all the way to the smallest radius accessible (r . 1\u2032 )\nfor each cluster (Fig. 6, red triangles), with no sign of a central turnover which would indicate the presence of unlensed\ncluster members, as discussed fully in \u00a7 6.\n\n3.3\n\nBlue Background and Foreground Galaxies\n\nAbove we have been able to define the region of CC space\noccupied by cluster members by virtue of their clustered\ndistribution. We have also defined with confidence a sample\nof red background galaxies lying well separated from cluster\nmembers and for which there is a clear WL signal. For bluer\ngalaxies the situation is more complex as these may comprise\nblue cluster members, foreground objects and background\nblue galaxies. This is of particular concern where only one\ncolour is available, and which we have shown in our earlier\nwork can lead to a dilution of the WL signal of blue selected\nobjects relative to the red background galaxies by unlensed\n\n5\n\nforeground galaxies and cluster members (Broadhurst et al.\n2005; Medezinski et al. 2007).\nWe can see in the CC plane of each cluster that there\nare two regions lying blueward of the cluster within which\nmost blue objects lie. For A370, where we have the deepest\ndataset, these density peaks are located around RC \u2212 z \u2032 \u223c 0\nand BJ \u2212 RC \u223c 0.8, 1.5. The redder of these two blue peaks\nlies in the centre of the CC plane, relatively close to the blueend of the cluster sequence (see Fig. 3, left panels, magenta\npoints). The spatial distribution of objects in this CC region shows no significant clustering about the cluster centre\n(see Fig. 3, middle panels, magenta circles). In addition, the\nWL signal of these objects (see Fig. 3, right panels, magenta\ncircles) shows very little signal, indicating this is a predominately unlensed population, and together with the lack of\nclustering means this blue peak is dominated by galaxies lying in the foreground of the cluster. The lensing signal here\nis not strictly zero but marginally positive, implying a relatively low level of 10\u221220% lensed background galaxies. This\nregion of CC space is clearly of no use for our purposes as it\ndoes not contain cluster members and is mostly unlensed. It\nis convenient, however, that the foreground unlensed population is so well defined in CC space as a clear overdensity\nand therefore can be readily excluded from our analysis. The\nredshift distribution of this population using deep field surveys (discussed in \u00a7 5) supports our finding that the bulk of\nthis population lies at low redshift.\nThe bluer of the two peaks, in the extreme blue corner of\nCC space seen in Fig. 2 (lower left peak) is also unclustered\non the sky, indicating no significant cluster members lie in\nthis region (Fig. 3, middle panels, black squares). This blue\noverdensity is the well known \"blue cloud\" identified in deep\nfield images. For each cluster, a clear WL signal is found for\nobjects lying in this blue cloud (Fig. 6, blue circles), rising\ntoward the centre of each cluster with a radial trend very\nsimilar to that of the red population ((Fig. 6, red triangles),\nindicating minimal foreground or cluster dilution of the WL\nsignal. Objects lying in this region are expected to fall in the\nredshift range 1 < z < 2.5 (discussed below in \u00a7 5). Hence,\nwe can safely conclude that these objects lie in the background with negligible cluster or foreground contamination,\nwhich would otherwise drag down the central WL signal.\nThe boundaries we have chosen for this blue sample and\nplotted in Fig. 3 (left panels, blue points), are extended to\ninclude objects lying outside the main blue cloud but well\naway from the foreground and cluster populations defined\nabove, in order to maximise the size of the blue sample but\nsteering well clear of contamination by unlensed low redshift objects. We further limit the blue sample magnitude in\nthe range 22 < mAB < 26 to avoid contamination by very\nbright foreground galaxies, and to avoid incompleteness at\nthe faint end.\n\n4\n\nEVOLUTIONARY COLOUR TRACKS\n\nIn order to examine in more detail the sample selection technique, we overlay evolutionary and empirical tracks on the\nCC plane, for different classes of galaxies. We first calculate non-evolving magnitudes in Subaru filters BJ , RC , z \u2032\nas a function of redshift using different galaxy templates\nconstructed empirically for elliptical, Scd and starburst\n\n\f6\n\nE.

Sample selection and analysis. Left: CC diagrams, for A1703 (a), A370 (b) and RXJ1347-11 (c) (top to bottom), displaying\nthe green sample, comprising mostly cluster member galaxies, and the red and blue samples, comprising of background galaxies. The\ngalaxies that we identify as predominantly foreground lie in between the cluster and background galaxies are marked in magenta. Centre:\nSurface number density of galaxies vs. radius. Background (red+blue galaxies) density (black squares) is fairly constant with radius,\nexcept for a slight decrease in the central region (depletion due to lensing magnification effect). The green sample (green pentagrams) rises\nsteeply toward the centre as expected for cluster members. The magenta sample (magenta diamonds) has a flat density profile, meaning\nthese are not part of the cluster. Right: Tangential distortion vs. radius. The background (black squares) rises continuously toward the\ncentre, representing real WL signal. The green sample distortion (green pentagrams) is essentially in agreement with zero, as expected\nfrom unlensed cluster galaxies, and the magenta sample distortion (magenta diamonds) is significantly lower than the background WL\nsignal, indicating object selected in this CC range are mostly unlensed foreground galaxies. However, the magenta sample also contains\nto some extent background galaxies, therefore the WL signal is slightly higher than zero.\n\ntypes from the Kinney-Calzetti library (Calzetti, Kinney &\nStorchi-Bergmann 1994; Kinney et al. 1996). The resulting\ncolour tracks are overplotted in Fig. 4 (top) on the BJ \u2212 RC\nvs. RC \u2212 z \u2032 plane of A370. These templates show how the\nforeground population of galaxies in the centre of the CC\nplane quickly jumps above a redshift of \u223c 1 to the lower\nblue density peak. For the E/S0 it appears that even the noevolution track is a good fit to a distribution of red galaxies\nwhich fall on a well-defined loop visible in the CC plane with\na maximum red colour of BJ \u2212 RC = 2.5, RC \u2212 z \u2032 = 1.5 at\na redshift of z \u223c 0.8. The remainder of the loop is not well\n\nconstrained (and we therefore leave it out), likely where evolution kicks in making the SED of early-type objects bluer.\nTo generate evolving tracks representing the evolution\nof galaxy SED's, the Galev2 (Kotulla et al. 2009) code was\nused to represent galaxy types with different star-formation\nhistories \u2013 a short 3 Gyr starburst (Z\u2299 ), E-type (exponentially declining SFR with Z\u2299 ), S0 (gas-related SFR with\nZ\u2299 ), Sa (gas-related SFR with 2.5Z\u2299 ), Sb (gas-related SFR\nwith 0.4Z\u2299 ) and Sd (constant SFR with 0.2Z\u2299 ) (Fig. 4, bottom). It is evident that at low redshifts the modeled galaxies\n2\n\nhttp://www.galev.org/\n\n\fMass and Light profiles of A1703, A370& RXJ1347-11\n\n7\n\ncoincide with the high central peak we recognized above with\nour WL technique to be foreground, and as they are redshifted the colours of E/S0 galaxies agree at z \u223c 0.4 with the\ncluster colours. At higher redshifts the early types objects\nbecome bluer due to the effect of evolution, and also the latetype galaxies jump quickly across the valley and fall close\nto the observed trail of red and blue background galaxies at\n1 < z < 2. At even higher redshifts (z > 2.5), they fade out\nfrom the BJ -band and become redder in BJ \u2212 RC , agreeing\nwith observed colours of dropout galaxies. Accounting for\nevolution, the tracks follow more carefully the trend around\nthe lower-left blue corner (BJ \u2212 RC \u223c 0.1, RC \u2212 z \u2032 \u223c 0), seen\nclearly from the galaxy colour distribution.\nIn general, similar behaviour is seen for both methods,\ngiving compelling evidence that in this CC plane the foreground and cluster galaxies are rather well-separated from\nthe higher-redshift background galaxies, and support the\npicture we presented above for the safe selection of background galaxies for a WL study. The slight differences in\ncolour (offset seen from the Galev models to bluer BJ \u2212 RC\ncolours for example) is interesting and may arise from the\ninclusion of evolution, the presence of dust or minor model\nuncertainties. The shape of the early-type galaxy loop is\ncertainly worth exploring in greater detail and may help\nto constrain the general evolutionary history of early-type\ngalaxies.\n\n5\n\nDEPTH ESTIMATION FROM SDF/COSMOS\n\nThe lensing signal is dependent on the source distance, scaling linearly with Dls /Ds , the lensing distance ratio. We thus\nneed to estimate and correct for the respective depths of the\ndifferent samples. To this end we rely on accurate photometric redshifts derived for two deep, multi-band field surveys, the Subaru Deep Field (SDF; Kashikawa et al. 2004),\nand COSMOS (Capak et al. 2007). For the SDF, photometric redshifts are calculated with BPZ (Ben\u0131\u0301tez 2000),\nusing a new template library, generated using a set of PEGASE templates (Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange 1997) which\napproximates the library described in Ben\u0131\u0301tez et al. (2004)\nand Coe et al. (2006). This new library has an accuracy of\n\u03b4z/(1 + z) = 0.037 with the FIREWORKS catalog (Wuyts\net al. 2009) and a low catastrophic error rate. Using those\nphoto-z, and the spectral classification provided by BPZ,\nwe generate magnitudes in the required Subaru filters to\nmatch the cluster observations. We select samples according\nto CC/magnitude limits described above (Fig. 3) for A370\nand RXJ1347-11 (the SDF filters are not matched with the\nfilters used for A1703). The resulting redshift distributions of\nthe green (thin solid line), red (thick solid line), blue (dashed\nline) and foreground (dash-dotted line) samples selected to\nmatch A370 samples using SDF are displayed in Fig. 5 (top).\nFor COSMOS, photometric redshifts have been derived\nby Ilbert et al. (2009) using 30 bands in the UV to mid-IR.\nSince the COSMOS photometry does not cover the Subaru\nRC band, we need to estimate RC -band magnitudes for it.\nWe use the HyperZ (Bolzonella, Miralles & Pell\u00f3 2000) template fitting code to obtain the best-fitting spectral template\nfor each galaxy, from which the RC magnitude is derived\nwith the transmission curve of the Subaru RC -band filter\n(see Umetsu et al. 2009b). We then select samples by ap-\n\nFigure 4.

Bottom:\nSynthetic colour tracks including evolution, calculated with the\nGalev code for a single 3 Gyr burst, elliptical, S0, Sa, Sb and Sd\ntype models.\n\nplying the same CC/magnitude limits as for A1703, A370\nand RXJ1347-11. The resulting redshift distributions of the\ngreen (thin solid line), red (thick solid line), blue (dashed\nline) and foreground (dash-dotted line), samples selected to\nmatch A370 samples using COSMOS are displayed in Fig. 5\n(bottom). The results for each sample using SDF or COSMOS are summarized in table 2.\nAlthough SDF is deeper, COSMOS redshifts are based\non more bands over a wider spectral range. However, as\nstated in Ilbert et al. (2009), COSMOS photo-z's are reliable\nonly to a magnitude of i\u2032 < 25, which is below our magnitude\ncutoff for the sample selection. We therefore make sure to\nlimit our redshift estimation for the green sample to z < 3,\nto avoid mistakenly including high-z dropouts that lie above\nthe cluster in CC due to slight photometric offsets or unreliable photo-z's.

These depth values will\nbe used later to correct the lensing signal (see \u00a7 7).\nImportantly, this redshift analysis independently supports our assessment in both sections 3 & 4 that the various regions of the CC space correspond to differing populations. In particular the foreground population isolated in\nthe centre of the CC diagram (shown in Fig. 3, magenta\npoints, whose redshift distribution is shown in Fig. 5, magenta dotted-dashed curve) corresponds to predominantly\nlow redshift galaxies z\u0304 \u2243 0.4, most of which are in the foreground of the clusters examined here, or at such low redshift behind the cluster that the lensing signal is small by\nvirtue of the small separation, Dls , between the lens and\nthe source. In contrast, the red and blue populations are\nmuch more distant lying well behind our clusters, supporting our conclusion that the continuously rising WL signal of\nthese populations is not significantly contaminated by cluster members. This also indicates that the predicted level of\nunlensed foreground galaxies is negligible for the red sample,\nas expected, and with only a possible \u223c 10% dilution in the\nblue.\n\nN(z)\n\n0.2\n\n6\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\nz\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\nFigure 5.

Kaiser 3 to\nperform object detection and shape measurements, following the formalism outlined in Kaiser, Squires & Broadhurst\n(1995, hereafter KSB). Our analysis pipeline is described in\nUmetsu et al. (2009b). We have tested our shape measurement and object selection pipeline using STEP (Heymans\net al. 2006) data of mock ground-based observations (see\nUmetsu et al. 2009b, \u00a7 3.2). Full details of the methods are\npresented in Umetsu & Broadhurst (2008), Umetsu et al.\n(2009a) and Umetsu et al. (2009a).

The green pentagrams slightly rise to the\nbackground level at large radii, indicating the green sample still\ncontains some level of background galaxies at the outskirts of\nthe cluster, and is consistent with zero towards the cluster centre\nwhere cluster members dominate the green sample and dilute the\nlensing signal.\n\n\u03b8 [arcmin]\n\nFigure 7.

We emphasize that this level of calibration bias is sub-dominant compared to the statistical\nuncertainty (\u223c 15%) in the mass due to the intrinsic scatter\nin galaxy shapes. Rather, the most critical source of systematic uncertainty in cluster weak lensing is dilution of the\ndistortion signal due to the inclusion of unlensed foreground\nand cluster member galaxies, which can lead to an underestimation of the true signal for R < 400 kpc/h by a factor of\n\n\fE. Medezinski et al.\n\n2 \u2212 5, as demonstrated in Broadhurst et al. (2005), Medezinski et al. (2007) and here.\nThe shape distortion of an object is described by the\ncomplex reduced-shear, g = g1 + ig2 , where the reducedshear is defined as:\ng\u03b1 \u2261 \u03b3\u03b1 /(1 \u2212 \u03ba).\n\n(1)\n\nThe tangential component of the reduced-shear, gT , is used\nto obtain the azimuthally averaged distortion due to lensing,\nand computed from the distortion coefficients g1 , g2 :\ngT = \u2212(g1 cos 2\u03b8 + g2 sin 2\u03b8),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the position angle of an object with respect to the\ncluster centre,\n\u221a and the uncertainty in the gT measurement is\n\u03c3T = \u03c3g / 2 \u2261 \u03c3 in terms of the RMS error \u03c3g for the complex reduced-shear measurement. To improve the statistical\nsignificance of the distortion measurement, we calculate the\nweighted average of gT and its weighted error, as\nP\ni ug,i g+,i\nP\nhgT (\u03b8n )i =\n,\n(3)\ni ug,i\nvP\nu\nu\nu2g,i \u03c3i2\n\u03c3T (\u03b8n ) = t Pi\n(4)\n\u00012 ,\ni ug,i\nwhere the index i runs over all of the objects located within\nthe nth annulus with a median radius of \u03b8n , and ug,i is\n2\nthe inverse variance weight for ith object, ug,i = 1/(\u03c3g,i\n+\n\u03b12 ), softened with \u03b1. We choose \u03b1 = 0.4, which is a typical\nvalue of the mean RMS \u03c3\u0304g over the background sample.\nThe case with \u03b1 = 0 corresponds to an inverse-variance\nweighting. On the other hand, the limit \u03b1 \u226b \u03c3g,i yields\na uniform weighting. We have confirmed that our results\nare insensitive to the choice of \u03b1 (i.e., inverse-variance or\nuniform weighting) with the adopted smoothing parameters.\nIn Fig. 6 we plot the radial profile of gT of the green\n(pentagrams), red (triangles) and blue (circles) samples defined above. The black squares represent the red+blue combined sample, showing the best estimate of the lensing signal. The red and blue samples profiles rise continuously toward the centre for each of the clusters, and are in good\nagreement with each other, demonstrating that both are\ndominated by background galaxies and are not contaminated by the cluster at all radii. The gT profile of the green\nsample lies close to zero, especially at small radii, but shows\na small positive signal at large radius, close in amplitude\nto the background signal measured above, meaning at beyond \u223c 5\u2032 there are few cluster members in comparison to\n\"green\" background galaxies. Indeed, the virial radius derived from our best fitting NFW model lies at about 10\u2032 \u221215\u2032\nand so physically it is reasonable that the cluster population\nis small here. The measured zero level of tangential distortion interior to this radius for the green sample reinforces\nour CC selection.\n\n7\n\nWEAK LENSING DILUTION\n\nWe can now estimate the fraction of cluster galaxies by taking the ratio of the WL signal between the green sample\nand the background sample, with the background including\nboth red and blue galaxies as explained in \u00a7 3.\nFor a given radial bin (rn ) containing objects in the\n\nA1689: \u22121.5\u00b10.08\n\nLuminosity density [L\u03bf h2 Mpc\u22122]\n\n10\n\nA1703: \u22120.95\u00b10.1\nA370: \u22121.4\u00b10.06\n\n13\n\n10\n\nRXJ1347:\u22120.9\u00b10.1\n\n12\n\n10\n\n11\n\n10\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nr/rvir\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n2\n\nFigure 8. \"g-Weighted\" luminosity density vs. r/rvir for A1689\n(magenta circles), A1703 (cyan asterisks), A370 (red squares) and\nRXJ1347-11 (green diamonds). The flux Fi (green sample) of each\ngalaxy is weighted by its tangential distortion gT,i with respect\nto the background distortion signal. The dashed lines are the best\nfitting lines whose slopes are given in the legend. For clarity, the\nluminosity profiles have been shifted by a factor: A1703 shifted\nup by a factor of 2, A370 by a factor of 3, and RXJ1347-11 by a\nfactor of 1.2.\n\n(G)\n\ngreen sample (\u00a7 2), the mean value of gT (eq. 3) is an\naverage of the signal over cluster members and some back(G)\nground galaxies. Thus, its mean value hgT i will be lower\n(B)\nthan the true background level denoted by hgT i (Fig. 6)\nin proportion to the fraction of unlensed galaxies in the bin\nthat lie in the cluster (rather than in the background), since\nthe cluster members on average will add no net tangential\nsignal. Therefore,\nfcl (rn ) \u2261\n\nNcl\nNGreen\n\n=1\u2212\n\nhgT (rn )(G) i hD(B) i\nhgT (rn )(B) i hD(G) i\n\n(5)\n\nis the cluster membership fraction of the green sample,\nwhere hD(B) i and hD(G) i are the mean lensing depths,\nDls /Ds , of the background and green galaxy samples, respectively, derived in \u00a7 5 (see full derivation in the appendix\nof Medezinski et al. 2007).\nIn Fig. 7 we show this ratio for each of our new clusters. In our previous analysis of A1689, where only colourmagnitude selection was done, many background galaxies\nwere present in the green sample, so that only in the first\nradial bins the fraction of cluster galaxies was high, and\ngradually declined with radius (due to increasing fraction of\nbackground galaxies) at larger radii. Here, since we select a\ntight region around the cluster in CC and are able to better resolve it, our results show that the fraction is close to\nunity throughout the radial range of the cluster. Only in the\nouter bins, usually at r > 5\u2032 \u2212 10\u2032 does the fraction decline,\nand we see a smaller percentage of cluster members. Large\nerrorbars are introduced at outer radii since there are few\ncluster galaxies present, making it harder to use this effect\nin order to determine cluster membership.\n\n\fMass and Light profiles of A1703, A370& RXJ1347-11\n9\n\n600\n\n500\n\nM/L [ hMo/L\u03bf]\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nr/rvir\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n2\n\nFigure 9.

The profiles are similar to each other, peaking\naround 0.2rv ir, and declining continuously to the virial radius,\nwhich seems to be a general property of all well-studied clusters.\n\n8\n\nCLUSTER LIGHT PROFILES\n\nWe now turn to translate the deduced profile of membership\nfraction to a cluster luminosity profile. To account for the\nbackground contribution in the green sample and deduce\nonly the cluster luminosity, we firstX\nmeasure the flux of all\n(G)\nFi , and then subthe galaxies in the green sample,\ni\n\ntract the flux of the i-th galaxy weighted by it's tangential\ndistortion, gi , relative to the background sample distortion,\nhgT (rn )(B) i. When averaged over the entire green sample\nthis will have zero contribution from the unlensed cluster\nmembers, but will remove the contribution of background\ngalaxies present in the green sample. The total flux of the\ncluster in the nth radial bin is therefore,\nFcl (rn ) =\n\nX\ni\n\n(G)\n\nFi\n\n\u2212\n\nhD(B) i/hD(G) i X (G) (G)\nFi gT,i\nhgT (rn )(B) i\ni\n\n(6)\n\nand the flux is then translated to luminosity. First we calculate the absolute magnitude,\nM = m \u2212 5 log dL \u2212 K(z) + 5,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the K-correction is evaluated for each radial bin according to its colour. The luminosity is simply,\nL = 100.4(M\u2299 \u2212M ) L\u2299 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere M\u2299 is the absolute magnitude of the Sun (AB system)\nin the relevant band.\nThe results for all four clusters, including A1689, are\nshown in Fig. 8. As explained in \u00a7 3, the green sample comprises mostly of cluster galaxies, therefore the correction is\nnot big for r < 10\u2032 , and only present at large radii, increasing the error. The cluster luminosity profiles mostly\nhave a steady linear decline with radius, and are well described by a power-law fit, but with different slopes of\nd log(L)/d log(r) \u223c \u22120.95 \u00b1 0.1, \u22121.4 \u00b1 0.06, \u22120.9 \u00b1 0.1 for\nA1703, A370 and RXJ1347-11, respectively.\n\n11\n\nM/L PROFILES\n\nWe may now derive a radial profile of the differential massto-light ratio (often referred to as \u03b4M (r)/\u03b4L(r)) by dividing\nthe best-fit NFW projected mass density profile by the newly\nderived luminosity density profile obtained in \u00a7 8. The four\nM/L profiles are shown together in Fig. 9 to the limit of our\ndata, \u223c 3 Mpc/h. The mass profiles for these clusters and\ntheir NFW fits were derived in our earlier work, Broadhurst\net al. (2005) for A1689 and in Broadhurst et al. (2008) for\nA370, A1703 and RXJ1347 based on the sample selection\nscheme described in this paper.\nFor A1689, we found previously that the M/L ratio\npeaks at intermediate radius around r \u223c 100h\u22121 kpc and\nthen falls off to larger radius. Here we find a similar behavior for the other clusters, especially evident for A370,\nwhere M/L peaks at about r \u223c 350h\u22121 kpc with values\nof M/LR \u223c 300 \u2212 400 h(M/L)\u2299 , and declines to values\nof M/LR \u223c 100 h(M/L)\u2299 at the outskirts. A decline in\nM/L is also seen towards the centre of the cluster, reaching\nM/LR \u223c 200 h(M/L)\u2299 below r . 200h\u22121 kpc. The M/L\nprofile of A1703 also shows a similar trend, where it peaks\nat a radius of r \u223c 200 \u2212 300h\u22121 kpc with values of M/Lr\u2032 \u223c\n300 h(M/L)\u2299 and declines gradually to values of M/Lr\u2032 \u223c\n100 h(M/L)\u2299 at large radii. The profile of RXJ1347-11\ndeclines from values of M/LR \u223c 400 \u2212 500 h(M/L)\u2299 at\nr \u223c 200 \u2212 300h\u22121 kpc to values of M/LR \u223c 100 h(M/L)\u2299\nat large radius.\nThe decrease in M/L values toward the centre of the\ncluster is only really evident for two clusters, A1689 and\nA370. For these clusters the luminosity profiles are relatively\nsteep, and it this is continuation of a steep power-law towards the centre that causes M/L to decline, as the mass\nprofiles are not power-law but have a continuously declining\ngradient towards the cluster centres (NFW-like), so that the\nproportion of M/L declines markedly interior to the characteristic radius for these two clusters.\nThe decrease in M/L toward large radius seen for all\nfour clusters is possibly explained by the increasing proportion of later type galaxies at larger radii, a manifestation\nof the morphology-density relation (Dressler 1980). Similar\nresults have been shown by Rines et al. (2000) and Katgert\net al. (2004); in Rines et al. (2000) where the differential\nM/L profile is similar to ours, with a decreasing M/L with\nradius, and their outermost value of M/LR 100 h(M/L)\u2299\nis in good agreement with the values we get for all our four\nclusters. Katgert et al. (2004) show a decrease at small radius, and by removing the brightest cluster members this\ndecrease is shown to disappear.\nThe declining behavior is not simply accounted for by\nthe change of stellar population with distance from the cluster centre. The galaxy colours show a very moderate decline\nwith radius. In the case of A370, the radial colour gradient\nis d(B \u2212 z \u2032 )/d log(r) = \u22120.13 \u00b1 0.04, equivalent to a total\nchange of \u03b4(B \u2212 z \u2032 ) = 0.12 over the virial radius. This corresponds to a change in the mean stellar mass-to light ratio,\nM\u2217 /LR , of only \u223c 17%. Therefore, such a small correction\nalone cannot explain the declining trend of M/L with radius.\nWe now further examine the behaviour of M/L by separating cluster member galaxies by colour and by luminosity.\nThere is a clear distinction between the M/L profiles based\non colour selection as shown in Fig. 10.

Clearly the\nbehavior of the early and later types is not a strong function of\nluminosity.\n\nthe sequence galaxies (inside the white solid line marked in\nFig. 2) the M/L profiles are relatively flatter for all the\nclusters (Fig. 10, red circles), showing mild decline with radius, whereas the remaining non-sequence objects (the rest\nof the green population between the white dashed line and\nthe solid while line marked in Fig. 2) have a steep dependence (Fig. 10, blue hexagrams) which is clearly responsible\nfor the majority of the trend of M/L found above for the\n\n\fMass and Light profiles of A1703, A370& RXJ1347-11\n3\n\n10\n\naearly,bright=\u22121.2\u00b10.2\n\nn [Mpc\u22122]\n\naearly,faint=\u22120.79\u00b10.3\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n3\n10\n10\n\nr [Mpc]\n\nalate,bright=\u22120.42\u00b10.2\nalate,faint=\u22120.42\u00b10.1\n\nn [Mpc\u22122]\n\ncluster population as a whole (Fig. 10, black squares). If\nwe now further divide these subsamples by luminosity into\ntwo broad bins as shown in Fig. 11, we see that this difference between the sequence and non-sequence populations\nis not strongly dependent on luminosity. If we also look at\nthe number-density profile of each of these four subsamples\n(Fig. 12), we see that the early-type galaxies (red circles) are\nmore concentrated than the later types (blue hexagrams),\nindependently of luminosity.\nIt is evident from the above comparisons that later-type\ngalaxies are relatively rare in the cluster centre, an effect\nwhich most likely has its origins in tidal and/or stripping\nof infalling later-type galaxies and their transformation into\nredder and rounder galaxies predominating in cluster centres. We now explore tidal effects in this context and comment on other related work.\n\n13\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nr [Mpc]\n3\n\n10\n\naearly,faint=\u22121\u00b10.2\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n3\n\nn [Mpc\u22122]\n\n10\n\nr [Mpc]\n\nalate,bright=\u22120.65\u00b10.3\nalate,faint=\u22120.64\u00b10.2\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\nr [Mpc]\n\naearly,bright=\u22121.2\u00b10.2\naearly,faint=\u22120.89\u00b10.2\n\nn [Mpc\u22122]\n\nIn CDM-dominated cosmological models, the growth of\nstructure is hierarchical, with clusters evolving through\nmany merger events during which galaxies are dynamically\naffected to a varying degree based on their formation times\nand spatial locations in their parent systems. This process\ncan be described by the excursion set formalism (Lacey &\nCole 1993) with more detailed insight gained from hydrodynamical simulations. It has been clearly demonstrated that\nduring these merger events DM haloes suffer pronounced\ntidal stripping (e.g., Moore et al. 1996). Detailed N-body\nsimulations indicate that up to 70% of the mass may be\nstripped from halos orbiting close to the centre of massive\nclusters when integrated over the Hubble time, and with\n\u223c 20% loss even near the virial radius (Nagai & Kravtsov\n2005). Statistical evidence for halo truncation is claimed also\nfrom lensing based measurements (Natarajan et al. 2002,\n2009).\nAs can be expected, simulations show that despite the\nsubstantial effect of tidal forces in removing the outer DM\nfrom galaxy halos, the stellar content of early-type galaxies is only weakly affected by tidal interactions due to the\ncentralised location of most stars within the DM halos (Nagai & Kravtsov 2005; Reed et al. 2005). Hence, the ratio of\ntotal mass to galaxy luminosity is predicted to be approximately independent of radius in this context. In detail, the\nabove simulations show a mild radial decline of the ratio of\nthe total mass density over the number density of DM halos, M/n, as shown in Fig. 13 (dashed curve). The relatively\ngentle declining trend in this ratio is the result of tidal forces\n(Nagai & Kravtsov 2005; Reed et al. 2005), which act over\ntime to reduce the number of sub halos in the inner region\nas compared to the cluster outskirts.\nThis M/n ratio is a very useful prediction of the simulations which may be readily compared to our data. For each\ncluster we indeed find a gentle decline in the ratio of the\ntotal mass to the number of early type galaxies, the mean\nslope of which is in very good agreement with the prediction as shown in Fig. 13. The declining trend in this ratio is\nseen in the region 0.1 \u2212 1 rvir , in good agreement with the\nprediction by Nagai & Kravtsov (2005).\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\nr [Mpc]\nn [Mpc\u22122]\n\nTidal and Ram-Pressure Stripping\n\nn [Mpc\u22122]\n\naearly,bright=\u22121.3\u00b10.2\n\n9.1\n\nalate,bright=\u22120.31\u00b10.4\nalate,faint=\u22120.52\u00b10.3\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\nr [Mpc]\n\nFigure 12.

Dashed line shows\nthis ratio as calculated from the simulations of Nagai & Kravtsov\n(2005). The observed trend is similar to the theoretical prediction\nfor each of the clusters and can be attributed theoretically to tidal\neffects by the cluster acting on the galaxy DM halos.\n\nAs we showed in \u00a7 9 the ratio of the total mass density to bluer cluster members light density has a very steep\ndecline with radius \u2013 much greater than the mild trend observed above for early-type red sequence galaxies. The tendency towards an increasing proportion of early-type galaxies near cluster centres (also evident in Fig. 12) is of course\nwell known and is understood empirically to result from\nthe disruption of the gaseous disks of infalling galaxies. Radio continuum observations reveal that \"wide-angle tails\"\nof gaseous material appearing to trail behind disk galaxies\n(e.g., Marvel, Shukla & Rhee 1999). Recently spectacular\nlarge trails of H\u03b1 emission have been detected around disk\ngalaxies in the Coma and Virgo clusters (Bravo-Alfaro et al.\n2000; Vollmer et al. 2004; Kenney et al. 2008). The most\nimpressive object is a large spiral galaxy (NGC 4438) with\nobvious disrupted arms and a long trail (\u223c 120 kpc) of H\u03b1\nemission revealing the orbit of this galaxy has been bent\naround the massive central galaxy, M86, with a large relative velocity of \u223c 500 km/s (Kenney et al. 2008).\nRam-pressure stripping has long been calculated to be\nimportant (Gunn & Gott 1972) for disk galaxies (in clusters), removing preferentially the relatively low-density gas\nwithin a characteristic stripping radius, the scale of which\ncan be estimated from basic considerations, and which was\nverified by careful simulations (Abadi, Moore & Bower 1999;\nKronberger et al. 2008). The loss of gas has a transformative effect on both the morphology and the colours of such\nobjects, a process which is claimed as a natural explanation\nfor the cluster populations of S0 galaxies, (Homeier et al.\n2005; Postman et al. 2005; Poggianti et al. 2009; HuertasCompany et al. 2009) and which is also related to the evolution of cluster gas metallicity (Schindler et al. 2005; Arieli,\nRephaeli & Norman 2008).\n\nCLUSTER LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS\n\nThe data allow the LF to be usefully constructed in several independent radial and magnitude bins, and hence we\ncan examine the form of the LF of cluster members as a\nfunction of projected distance from the cluster centre. By\nmeasuring the degree of dilution separately in each magnitude bin we can construct LFs without resorting to uncertain\nbackground subtraction.\nHere, the dilution correction is evaluated as a function\nof magnitude and radius. Left panels of Fig. 14 show the tangential distortion of the green sample versus absolute magnitude bin, and the reference background distortion level is\nmarked in the black solid line; see (Medezinski et al. 2007)\nfor more details. To correct for this we apply equation (5)\nto each magnitude bin:\n(G)\n\n(B)\n\n\u03a6cl (Mk ) = \u03a6(Mk )[1 \u2212 hgT (Mk )i/hgT (r)i]\n\n(9)\n\n(Note that the background signal is averaged over the whole\nrange of magnitudes at that radius). The correction for background present in the green sample is in fact not large for the\nbrighter bins, but is more essential at the fainter bins, with\nmagnitude MR & \u221218. This is similar to the observation we\nmade in \u00a7 7 for the radial profile of the fraction correction,\nonly there the correction was a function of radius, and here\nit is a function of magnitude.\nWe construct LFs in three broad radial annuli, except\nfor RXJ1347-11 for which this is feasible \u2013 due to its small\nangular size \u2013 only in two bins. The results are shown in\nFig. 14 (centre panels). Each LF is well fitted by a Schechter\n(1976) function (dashed lines), and the confidence contours\nfor the Schechter function parameters M\u2217 and \u03b1 are shown\non the right-hand panels of Fig. 14. The Schechter fit parameters are also specified in table 3. Clearly there is no\nevidence for a distinct upturn, to the limits of the photometry of any of our clusters. The slope of the Schechter function is well defined in each case, lying in a tight range, from\n\u03b1 = \u22120.95 \u00b1 0.05 to \u03b1 = \u22121.24 \u00b1 0.2. Also, there is no\nsignificant radial dependence in the shape of the LFs with\ndistance from the cluster centre. There may however be some\nevidence that in the outer radial bin the LFs are somewhat\nsteeper than in the centre of the cluster for A1703, as can\nbe seen in Fig. 14, where the slope changes from \u03b1 \u223c \u22120.95\nto \u03b1 \u223c \u22121.1 to \u03b1 \u223c \u22121.25 at larger radius. The knee of the\nLFs, namely the bright-end break, is very distinct, and is\naround M\u2217r\u2032 \u223c \u221221.5 for A1703, M\u2217R \u223c \u221222.5 for A370,\nand M\u2217R \u223c \u221222 for RXJ1347-11.\nFor A1689 we also saw no upturn at the faint magnitude limit, with \u03b1 = \u22121.05 \u00b1 0.07 (Medezinski et al. 2007).\nThere has been some significant disagreement regarding the\nshapes and faint-end slopes of LFs in clusters. Popesso et al.\n(2006) analyzing 69 RASS-SDSS clusters found a steep upturn at the faint-end by fitting a composite of two Schechter\nfunctions, with the faint-end fit slope being \u03b1 \u223c \u22122. Rines\n& Geller (2008) made a comprehensive study of two local\ngalaxy clusters, using spectroscopic data to identify securely\nthe cluster galaxies, for a more reliable measurement of cluster LFs. They found no distinct upturn for either of the clusters, with \u03b1 = \u22121.13 for A2199 and \u03b1 = \u22121.28 for the Virgo\ncluster. When measuring the overall slope of the composite\ncluster LF, i.e., up to the virial radius, we find slopes of\n\u03b1 \u223c \u22121.1 \u00b1 0.1 for all three clusters, in good agreement with\n\n\fMass and Light profiles of A1703, A370& RXJ1347-11\n3\n\n10\n\ng\n\n0.2\n\n+\n\n\u22120.93\n\n\u03b1=\u22120.95\u00b10.05 M*=\u221221.4\u00b10.6\n\n0\u22120.3 Mpc/h\n0.3\u22120.8 Mpc/h\n0.8\u22122.5 Mpc/h\n\n15\n\n\u22120.94\n\u22120.95 \u03b1\n\n0.1\n2\n\n\u22120.96\n\n\u22121\n\nmag ]\n\n10\n\n\u22121.06\n\n\u03b1=\u22121.08\u00b10.08 M*=\u221221.7\u00b10.8\n\n\u22121.07\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n0.1\n\n\u03a6(M) [h Mpc\n\ng 0.05\n\n\u22121.08\n\n1\n\n\u22121.09 \u03b1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n+\n\n0\n\n\u03b1=\u22121.24\u00b10.2 M*=\u221221.8\u00b13\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\ng+\n\n\u22121.1\n\n\u22121.2\n\n10\n\n0.01\n\n\u22121.25 \u03b1\n\n0\n\u22120.01\n\u221224\n\n\u22121.3\n\n\u22121\n\n\u221222\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221218\n\nM\n\n\u221216\n\n10\n\u221224\n\n\u221214\n\n\u221222\n\n\u221220\n\nr'\n\n\u221218\n\n\u221216\n\nM\n\n\u221214 \u221224\n\n\u221223\n\n\u221222\n\nM\n\n\u221221\n\n*r'\n\nR\n\n3\n\n10\n\n0.6\n\ng 0.4\n+\n\n\u22121.03\n\n\u03b1=\u22121\u00b10.04 M*=\u221222.4\u00b10.6\n\n0\u22120.3 Mpc/h\n0.3\u22121 Mpc/h\n1\u22122.2 Mpc/h\n\n\u22121.035\n\u22121.04 \u03b1\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\n\u22121.045\n\n\u22121\n\nmag ]\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u22121.11\n\n\u03b1=\u22121.12\u00b10.05 M =\u221222.1\u00b10.7\n*\n\n\u22122\n\n0.15\n\n\u03a6(M) [h Mpc\n\ng 0.1\n+\n\n\u03b1\n\u22121.13\n\n2\n\n0.05\n\n\u22121.12\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n0.06\n\n\u22121.14\n\n\u03b1=\u22121.18\u00b10.09 M =\u221222.8\u00b11\n*\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22121.16\n\ng+0.04\n\n\u22121.18 \u03b1\n\n0.02\n\n\u22121.2\n0\n\u221225\n\n\u22121\n\n\u221220\n\nM\n\n10\n\n\u221215\n\n\u221224\n\n\u221222\n\nR\n\n\u221220\n\nM\n\n\u221218\n\n\u221216\n\n\u221214\n\n\u221223.5\n\n\u221223\n\nM\n\n\u221222.5\n\n\u221222\n\n*R\n\nR\n\n3\n\n10\n\n0.25\n\n\u22120.98\n\n\u03b1=\u22121\u00b10.06 M =\u221221.6\u00b10.5\n\n0\u22120.8 Mpc/h\n0.8\u22122 Mpc/h\n\n*\n\n\u22120.985\n\n0.2\n10\n\n\u03a6(M) [h2 Mpc\u22122 mag\u22121]\n\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n0.06\n0.04\n\ng\n\n+\n\n\u22120.99\n\n2\n\ng+0.15\n\n\u22121.22\n\n0.02\n\n\u22120.995 \u03b1\n\u22121\n1\n\n10\n\n\u22121.005\n\u22121.01\n\u03b1=\u22121.12\u00b10.1 M*=\u221222\u00b12\n\n\u22121.08\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22121.1\n\u22121.12 \u03b1\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n\u22121.14\n\n0\n\n\u22121.16\n\u22120.02\n\u221225\n\n\u22122\n\n\u221220\n\nMR\n\n\u221215\n\n10\n\n\u221224\n\n\u221222\n\n\u221220\n\nMR\n\n\u221218\n\n\u221216\n\n\u221214\n\n\u221223\n\n\u221222\n\nM*R\n\n\u221221\n\nFigure 14.

Our clusters all show\nrelatively flat LFs, with only a weak radial dependence.\n\n11\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have compared in detail the dark and luminous properties of three high mass galaxy clusters, A1703,\nA370 and RXJ1347-11, and examined the relation between\nmass and light all the way out to the virial radius. We have\nfurther applied the WL dilution approach previously developed for A1689 (Medezinski et al. 2007) as an alternative\nmeans of obtaining the LF and light profiles of galaxy clusters. This based on the dilution of the lensing distortion signal by unlensed cluster members, and has the advantage of\nbeing independent of density fluctuations in the background.\nWe have examined clusters A1703, A370 and RXJ134711 for which data of exceptional quality has been taken\nwith Subaru/Suprime-Cam in multiple passbands. We have\nshown how a careful separation of the cluster, foreground,\nand background galaxies can be achieved using weak lensing information galaxy colours. We also make use of the\nclustering of cluster members, finding the cluster members\nare confined to a distinct region of CC space with relatively\nsmall mean radial distances. We have constructed a reliable\nbackground sample for WL measurements, by selecting red\nbackground galaxies whose WL signal rises all the way to\nthe centre of the cluster, and adding to those the faint cloud\nof very blue galaxies, whose WL signal we have shown is\nin good agreement with the red galaxies. We have avoided\ndilution of the WL signal by identifying and excluding the\nforeground population in the CC diagram for which no clustering or WL signal is detected. Together, the red and blue\nsamples WL measurements can be used to reconstruct accurate mass maps of all four clusters (see Broadhurst et al.\n2008).\nBy applying this sample selection and WL dilution correction, the LFs are derived for each of the clusters, in several radial bins, without the need of statistical background\nsubtraction. The LFs extend to very faint magnitude limits, MR \u223c \u221214, and each shows a very flat faint-end slopes,\n\u22120.95 6 \u03b1 6 \u22121.24, in agreement with our previous study\nfor A1689. There are various claims in the literature regarding the shape of the faint end of the galaxy LF (Popesso et al.\n\n2006; Rines & Geller 2008; Adami et al. 2008; Crawford,\nBershady & Hoessel 2009), with relatively flat slopes measured and found consistent with a simple Schechter function,\nand other work claiming a distinctive upturn at faint magnitudes. Differences may conceivably represent intrinsic differences between clusters, but a worry here is the uncertain\nsubtraction of the steep background counts of faint galaxies\nwhen evaluating the background using control fields. Uncertainties may result from inherent clustering of the background galaxies and also variations in photometric incompleteness, or differential extinction between the cluster and\ncontrol fields.\nRedshift measurements may remove concerns about\nthe background for complete surveys, but in practice spectroscopy can only reach interestingly faint limiting luminosities for fairly local clusters, requiring multiplexing capability\nover a wide-fields of view on large telescopes. Rines & Geller\n(2008) recently provided the tightest constraints from spectroscopy out to a sizable fraction of the virial radius, finding\nno significant upturn for the clusters studied. Confidence\nis gaining in the use of photometric redshifts, from careful\ndeep multi-colour imaging, which in the work of Adami et al.\n(2008) a relatively steep LF is claimed for Coma, but flatter\nslopes are measured for a sample of intermediate-redshift\nclusters (Crawford et al. 2009). Clearly, it is essential that\nthere is no significant confusion of background galaxies with\ncluster members or foreground, as is achieved with our approach.\nThe radial light profiles of these clusters are well\ncharacterized by a power-law slope of approximately\nd log(L)/d log(r) \u2243 \u22121 over all radii. These are compared\nwith the mass profiles from WL to derive the radial profile\nof the M/L ratio, a quantity which has hitherto not been\nconstrained in much detail, due to the difficulty of measuring mass profiles with sufficient precision and light profiles\nfree of systematic effects. Interestingly, we find that all our\nclusters show a very similar radial trend of M/L, peaking\nin the range M/LR \u223c 500 h(M/L)\u2299 at intermediate radius\n\u2243 0.15Rvir , and declining to approximately a limiting level\nof M/LR \u223c 100 h(M/L)\u2299 toward the virial radius of each\ncluster.\nThe decline of M/L towards large radius is very interesting and seems to be a universal feature of clusters, or at\nleast it is clearly found in the clusters we have been able\nto study here in sufficient detail and for A1689 (Medezinski\net al. 2007). Additionally, in the careful dynamical-based\nstudy of Rines et al. (2000) a similar declining trend was\nfound for A576. We have shown that such behavior is not\nsimply accounted for by the change in the stellar content\nof galaxies with distance from the cluster centre. The radial\ntrend of galaxy colours found is very mild and when corrected for using standard stellar population synthesis falls\nwell short of explaining the marked trend of M/L with radius.\nThe variation of M/L is however seen to be almost entirely stemming from the much steeper density profile of\nblue cluster members compared to the red sequence galaxies. The higher relative abundance of blue galaxies in the\nouter region of rich clusters is well known from local morphological studies and deeper work with high resolution (Rines\net al. 2000; Katgert et al. 2004; Postman et al. 2005) and\nis part of the general morphology-density relation (Dressler\n\n\fMass and Light profiles of A1703, A370& RXJ1347-11\n1980). Such behaviour is commonly explained by the continued conversion of disk galaxies into S0 galaxies, via tidal and\ngas stripping processes (Abadi et al. 1999), and thought to\nbe consistent with the observed evolution of the numbers of\nS0 galaxies relative to other cluster populations measured\nin the accessible redshift range z < 1 (Dressler 1980; Ellis et al. 1997; Postman et al. 2005; Poggianti et al. 2009;\nSimard et al. 2009). Disk galaxies are expected to be relatively more affected than early-type objects as their stellar\ncontent is relatively less bound gravitationally and the gas\nis susceptible to ram pressure from the ICM.\nIn contrast, for early-type galaxies the M/L profile we\nobtained for each cluster is fairly flat, with only a shallow\nradial decline for r > 200h\u22121 kpc. Interestingly CDM based\nN-body simulations aimed at evaluating the tidal influence\nof the cluster potential do claim to predict a shallow radial\ndecline in the ratio of cluster mass to the number of subhalos (Nagai & Kravtsov 2005; Reed et al. 2005; Natarajan\net al. 2009), matching well our observed trend. The simulations indicate that although up to 70% of a galaxy halo\nmass can be stripped over a Hubble time for those objects\nwith orbits bringing them close to the cluster centre, the\nstellar content is not likely to be significantly affected, at\nleast for early-type galaxies, as the stars are more tightly\nbound. Hence, a relatively flat relation is expected reflecting the relatively collisionless behaviour of both galaxies and\nDM. Therefore, even though tidal effects are significant, the\nluminous component that we measure when examining the\nM/L profile of early-type galaxies is expected to be only\nslightly affected, in good agreement with the mild decline\nwe observe for each cluster.\nFurther work on the tidal evolution of clusters is obviously needed. This is particularly important in view of the\ninteresting tension that has now emerged between the relatively concentrated mass profiles measured for many high\nmass clusters, compared to the much shallower mass profiles\npredicted by standard \u039bCDM (Duffy et al. 2008; Broadhurst\net al. 2008; Oguri et al. 2009). Steeper mass profiles lead to\nstronger tidal effects and compounded with the greater ages\nimplied by the relatively high concentrations should lead to\nmore significant tidal effects. Measuring directly the tidal\ntruncation of luminous cluster member galaxies should be\nfeasible via lensing in favorable cases where multiple images\nare locally affected by individual halos. The statistical influence on the general lensing deflection field has been claimed\nto be detected for two clusters independently by Natarajan\net al. (2009) for Cl0024+16 and by Halkola, Seitz & Pannella (2007) for A1689. These first results encourage further\ndeeper work with an emphasis on the degree of correlation of\nthe lensing signal with cluster member galaxies, a formidable\nchallenge but one well worthy of pursuit.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to N.
