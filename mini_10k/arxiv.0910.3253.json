A result that exhibits a duality between preclusive and precluding coevents is given. Some simple examples are presented.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe study of anhomomorphic logics for quantum mechanics was initiated\nby R. Sorkin [13]. Since then, other investigations in the subject have been\ncarried out [5, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16]. This work has usually been conducted in\nrelation to the subject of quantum measure theory and is mainly motivated by\nthe histories approach to quantum mechanics and quantum gravity [4, 6, 14].\nOne of the objectives of this subject is to describe the possible physical\nrealities and to identify the actual physical reality.\n1\n\n\fThe basic structure is given by a set of outcomes \u03a9 together with an algebra A of subsets of \u03a9 whose elements are called events. It is generally agreed\nthat possible realities are described by 1-0 functions from A to Z2 called\ntruth functions. There are various schemes for choosing truth-functions that\ncorrespond to possible realities [5, 13]. Two of the most popular have been\nthe linear and multiplicative schemes [5, 14, 15]. We shall mainly concentrate\non the quadratic scheme which has been rejected in the past but which we\nbelieve should be reconsidered. The elements of the chosen scheme are called\ncoevents. Various methods have been devised for filtering out the unwanted\ncoevents and selecting the actual reality. Three of these are called unitality,\nminimality and preclusivity [5, 14, 15, 16].\nIn Section 2 we discuss the various schemes and give a reason for choosing\nthe quadratic scheme. We call quadratic truth functions (grade-2) coevents.\nSection 3 discusses properties of these coevents. In Section 4 we consider\nprojections on the space A\u2217 of coevents and observables. We show that the\nset of projections forms an orthomodular poset. We introduce the concept\nof the master observable and present its properties. Section 5 considers the\nconcept of preclusivity. Preclusive coevents have already been discussed in\nthe literature and we introduce a stronger notion that we call precluding\ncoevents. This notion is defined naturally in terms of the master observable.\nWe close this section with some simple examples and a result that exhibits\na duality between preclusive and precluding coevents. For simplicity, the\noutcomes space \u03a9 will be assumed to have finite cardinality.\n\n2\n\nTruth Functions\n\nLet \u03a9 = {\u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9n } be the sample space for some physical experiment or\nsituation. We call the elements of \u03a9 outcomes and for simplicity we take\n\u03a9 to be finite. The outcomes could correspond to particle locations or spin\noutcomes or particle trajectories, or fine-grained histories, etc. Subsets of\n\u03a9 are called events and we denote the set of all events 2\u03a9 by A. We use\nthe notation AB for the intersection A \u2229 B and if A \u2229 B = \u2205 we write\nA \u222a\u0005 B = A \u222a B. We also use the notation A + B for the symmetric difference\n(AB \u2032 ) \u222a\u0005 (A\u2032 B) where A\u2032 denotes the complement of A.\nThe logic for A gives the contact with reality; that is, the logic describes\nwhat actually happens. What actually happens may be determined by a\ntruth function or 1-0 function \u03c6 : A \u2192 Z2 . If \u03c6(A) = 1, then A happens\n2\n\n\for A is true and if \u03c6(A) = 0, then A does not happen or A is false. Other\nterminology that is used is that A occurs or does not occur. Now there are\nvarious admissible 1-0 functions depending on the situation or state of the\nsystem. For classical logic it is assumed that \u03c6 is a homomorphism. That is,\n(1) \u03c6(\u03a9) = 1 (unital )\n(2) \u03c6(A + B) = \u03c6(A) + \u03c6(B) (additive)\n(3) \u03c6(AB) = \u03c6(A)\u03c6(B) (multiplicative)\nOf course, in Z2 = {0, 1} addition is modulo 2. If \u03c6 is a homomorphism, it\ncan be shown that there exists an \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a9 such that \u03c6(A) = 1 if and only if\n\u03b1 \u2208 A. Defining the containment map \u03b1\u2217 : A \u2192 Z2 by\n(\n1 if \u03b1 \u2208 A\n\u2217\n\u03b1 (A) =\n0 if \u03b1 \u2208\n/A\nwe have that \u03c6 = \u03b1\u2217 . This is eminently reasonable for classical mechanics.\nFor example a classical particle is definitely at a specific location \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a9 at\nany given time.\nHowever, in quantum mechanics, assuming that \u03c6 must be a homomorphism can result in a contradiction. For example, consider a three-slit experiment where \u03a9 = {\u03c91 , \u03c92 , \u03c93 } and \u03c9i is the outcome that a quantum particle\nimpinges the detection screen at a fixed small region \u2206 after going through\nslit i, i = 1, 2, 3 [14, 15]. Then it is possible for\n\u03c6 ({\u03c91 , \u03c92 }) = \u03c6 ({\u03c92 , \u03c93}) = 0\nIf \u03c6 were a homomorphism, it follows that \u03c6 = 0; i.e., \u03c6(A) = 0 for all A \u2208 A.\nThus, nothing happens. Mathematically this gives a contradiction because\nby (1), \u03c6(\u03a9) = 1. This also gives a physical contradiction because there are\ncertainly circumstances in which the particle is observed in \u2206. We again\nhave that \u03c6(\u03a9) = 1.\nThe fundamental question becomes: What are the admissible 1-0 functions for quantum mechanics? We have seen that there are n different homomorphisms corresponding to the n classical states and we have argued that\n(1), (2) and (3) are too restrictive for quantum mechanics. On the other\nn\nhand, there are 22 possible 1-0 functions on A and if we allow all of them,\nthen the logic will have nothing to say. Thus, to have viable theory some\n3\n\n\frestrictions must be put into place. In past studies, (1) is usually retained\nand either (2) or (3) are assumed [5, 14, 15]. In this work we shall not assume (1), (2) or (3) but shall postulate a generalization of (2). We shall also\ngive an argument for the plausibility of this postulate. Since it would be\nunreasonable to consider a 1-0 function \u03c6 that satisfies \u03c6(\u2205) = 1 whenever\nwe write \u03c6 : A \u2192 Z2 we are assuming that \u03c6(\u2205) = 0.\nBut first it is instructive to examine the form of 1-0 functions that satisfy\n(2) or (3). If \u03c6, \u03c8 : A \u2192 Z2 we define their sum and product by (\u03c6 + \u03c8)(A) =\n\u03c6(A) + \u03c8(A) and \u03c6\u03c8(A) = \u03c6(A)\u03c8(A). Of course, \u03c6 + \u03c8 and \u03c6\u03c8 are again 1-0\nfunctions. We can form polynomials in the containment maps \u03b1\u2217 for \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a9.\nFor example\n\u03b1\u2217 + \u03b2 \u2217 + \u03b1\u2217 \u03b2 \u2217 + \u03b1\u2217 \u03b3 \u2217 + \u03b1\u2217 \u03b2 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2217\nn\n\nis a degree-3 polynomial. Since there are 22 different polynomials, we conclude that every \u03c6 : A \u2192 Z2 can be uniquely represented by a polynomial\n(up to an ordering of the terms). The proof of parts of the following theorem\nare contained in [5, 14, 15]. Also, this theorem and Theorems 3.1, 3.3 and\n3.6 are special cases of more general results in the field of combinatorial polarization ([2] and references therein). We include the proofs for the reader's\nconvenience because they are shorter and more direct than the proofs for the\nmore general results.\nTheorem 2.1. (a) A nonzero \u03c6 : A \u2192 Z2 satisfies (2) if and only if \u03c6 =\n\u2217\nfor some \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1m \u2208 \u03a9. (b) \u03c6 : A \u2192 Z2 with \u03c6 6= 0, 1 satisfies\n\u03b11\u2217 +* * *+\u03b1m\n\u2217\n(3) if and only if \u03c6 = \u03b11\u2217 * * * \u03b1m\nfor some \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1m \u2208 \u03a9.\nProof. (a) We first show that \u03c6 : \u03b1 \u2192 Z2 is additive if and only if \u03c6 satisfies\n(4) \u03c6(A \u222a\u0005 B) = \u03c6(A) + \u03c6(B) for all disjoint A, B \u2208 A.\nIf \u03c6 is additive, then clearly \u03c6 satisfies (4). Conversely, if \u03c6 satisfies (4) then\nfor any A, B \u2208 A we have\n\u03c6(A) = \u03c6(AB \u2032 \u222a\u0005 AB) = \u03c6(AB \u2032 ) + \u03c6(AB)\nTherefore,\n\u03c6(A + B) = \u03c6(AB \u2032 \u222a\u0005 A\u2032 B) = \u03c6(AB \u2032 ) + \u03c6(A\u2032 B)\n= \u03c6(AB \u2032 ) + \u03c6(AB) + \u03c6(AB) + \u03c6(A\u2032 B)\n= \u03c6(A) + \u03c6(B)\n4\n\n\fso \u03c6 is additive. Now suppose \u03c6 : A \u2192 Z2 is additive and nonzero. Then\nthere exist \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1m \u2208 \u03a9 such that \u03c6(\u03b1i ) = 1, i = 1, . . . , m and \u03c6(\u03c9) = 0\nfor \u03c9 \u2208 {\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1m }\u2032 where for simplicity we write \u03c6(\u03c9) = \u03c6 ({\u03c9}). By (4),\nfor an A \u2208 A we have\n\u03c6(A) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c9i \u2208A\n\n\u03c6(\u03c9i ) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c6(\u03b1i ) =\n\n\u03b1i \u2208A\n\nX\n\n1=\n\n\u03b1i \u2208A\n\nm\nX\n\n\u03b1i\u2217 (A)\n\ni=1\n\n\u2217\nHence, \u03c6 = \u03b11\u2217 + * * * + \u03b1m\nand the converse is clear.\n\u2217\n\u2217\n(b) If \u03c6 = \u03b11 * * * \u03b1m , then\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03c6(AB) = \u03b11\u2217 (AB) * * * \u03b1m\n(AB) = \u03b11\u2217 (A)\u03b11\u2217 (B) * * * \u03b1m\n(A)\u03b1m\n(B)\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n= \u03b11 (A) * * * \u03b1m (A)\u03b11 (B) * * * \u03b1m (B) = \u03c6(A)\u03c6(B)\n\nso \u03c6 is multiplicative. Conversely, suppose that \u03c6 is multiplicative and \u03c6 6=\n0, 1. If A \u2286 B we have AB = A so that\n\u03c6(A) = \u03c6(AB) = \u03c6(A)\u03c6(B) \u2264 \u03c6(B)\nSince \u03c6 6= 0 there exists an A \u2208 A with \u03c6(A) = 1. Let\nB = \u2229 {A \u2208 A : \u03c6(A) = 1}\nThen B is the smallest set with \u03c6(B) = 1; that is, \u03c6(A) = 1 if and only\nif B \u2286 A. Since \u03c6 6= 1, B 6= \u2205. Letting B = {\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1m } we have that\n\u03c6(A) = 1 if and only if \u03b1i \u2208 A, i = 1, . . . , m. Hence,\n\u2217\n\u03c6(A) = \u03b11\u2217 * * * \u03b1m\n(A)\n\nIt follows from Theorem 2.1 that \u03c6 : A \u2192 Z2 is a homomorphism if and\nonly if \u03c6 = \u03b1\u2217 for some \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a9. We now consider a generalization of the\nadditivity condition (2). For \u03c6 : A \u2192 Z2 we define the m-point interference\nI\u03c6m as the map from m-tuples of distinct elements of \u03a9 into Z2 given by\nI\u03c6m (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1m ) = \u03c6 ({\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1m }) + \u03c6(\u03b11 ) + * * * + \u03c6(\u03b1m )\nwhere m \u2208 N with m \u2265 2. Since it is clear that \u03c6 is additive if and only if\nI\u03c6m = 0 for all m with 2 \u2264 m \u2264 n, we see that I\u03c6m gives a measure of the\namount that \u03c6 deviates from being additive. An analogous definition is used\nto describe interference for quantum measures [8]. Our basic postulate is\n5\n\n\fthat m-point interference is governed by two-point interferences, in the sense\nthat\nm\nX\nm\nI\u03c6 (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1m ) =\nI\u03c62 (\u03b1i , \u03b1i )\n(2.1)\ni<j=1\n\nWe call (2.1) for all 2 \u2264 m \u2264 n the two-point interference condition.\nWe say that \u03c6 : A \u2192 Z2 is grade-2 additive if\n\n\u03c6(A \u222a\u0005 B \u222a\u0005 C) = \u03c6(A \u222a\u0005 B) + \u03c6(A \u222a\u0005 C) + \u03c6(B \u222a\u0005 C) + \u03c6(A) + \u03c6(B) + \u03c6(C)\nfor all mutually disjoint A, B, C \u2208 A. We also call (2) grade-1 additivity and\nclearly grade-1 additivity implies grade-2 additivity but we shall see that the\nconverse does not hold. One can also define higher grade additivities but\nthese shall not be considered here [12].\nTheorem 2.2. A function \u03c6 : A \u2192 Z2 is grade-2 additive if and only if \u03c6\nsatisfies the two-point interference condition.\nProof. We shall show in Corollary 3.2 that \u03c6 is grade-2 additive if and only\nif\n\u03c6 ({\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1m }) =\n\nm\nX\n\n\u03c6 ({\u03b1i , \u03b1j }) + 21 [1 \u2212 (\u22121)m ]\n\ni<j=1\n\nm\nX\n\n\u03c6(\u03b1i )\n\n(2.2)\n\ni=1\n\nfor all m \u2208 N with 2 \u2264 m \u2264 n.

It follows from Theorem 2.2 that the\nset of possible realities for a quantum system is described by the set A\u2217 of\ngrade-2 additive functions from A to Z2 . We call the elements of A\u2217 coevents.\nWe first give the result that was needed in the proof of Theorem 2.2.\nTheorem 3.1.

A map \u03c6 : A \u2192 Z2 is a coevent if and only if (2.2) holds for\nall 2 \u2264 m \u2264 n.\nProof. If \u03c6 is a coevent, then \u03c6 satisfies (2.2) by letting Ai = {\u03b1i } in (3.1).\nConversely, suppose \u03c6 satisfies (2.2) and let A, B, C \u2208 A be mutually disjoint\nwith A = {\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n }, B = {\u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2s }, C = {\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3t }.

Various schemes\nfor anhomomorphic logics have been developed in the literature [5, 14, 15].\nIn fact, the present scheme was rejected in [5] because in some examples\nthere were not enough coevents available. The reason for this is that only\nminimal (or primitive) and unital coevents were considered. We disagree with\nthis analysis and believe that these restrictions are completely unnecessary.\nHowever, we shall later consider another means for restricting coevents that\nhas already been used, called preclusivity. We now give further properties of\ncoevents.\nTheorem 3.3. A map \u03c6 : A \u2192 Z2 is a coevent for \u03a9 = {\u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9n } if and\nonly if \u03c6 is a first or second degree polynomial in the \u03c9i\u2217 , that is\n\u03c6=\n\nn\nX\n\nai \u03c9i\u2217\n\n+\n\ni=1\n\nn\nX\n\ni,j=1\n\n9\n\nbij \u03c9i\u2217\u03c9j\u2217\n\n(3.2)\n\n\fwhere ai , bij \u2208 Z2 .\nProof. It is easy to check that \u03c9i\u2217\u03c9j\u2217 are coevents and that the sum of coevents\nis a coevent. Hence, any map \u03c6 : A \u2192 Z2 of the form (3.2) is a coevent.\nConversely, suppose \u03c6 : A \u2192 Z2 is a coevent. Reorder the \u03c9i if necessary so\nthat\n\u03c6(\u03c91 ) = * * * = \u03c6(\u03c9r ) = 1, \u03c6 ({\u03c9i , \u03c9j }) = * * * = \u03c6 ({\u03c9i\u2032 , \u03c9j \u2032 }) = 1, i, j, i\u2032 , j \u2032 \u2264 r\n\u03c6 ({\u03c9s , \u03c9t }) = * * * = \u03c6 ({\u03c9s\u2032 , \u03c9t\u2032 }) = 1, s, s\u2032 \u2264 r, t, t\u2032 > r\n\u03c6 ({\u03c9u , \u03c9v }) = * * * = \u03c6 ({\u03c9u\u2032 , \u03c9v\u2032 }) = 1, u, v, u\u2032, v \u2032 > r\nand \u03c6 is 0 for all other singleton and doubleton sets. Define \u03c8 : A \u2192 Z2 by\n\u03c8=\n\nr\nX\n\n\u03c9k\u2217 + \u03c9i\u2217 \u03c9j\u2217 + * * * + \u03c9i\u2217\u2032 \u03c9j\u2217\u2032 + \u03c9u\u2217 \u03c9v\u2217 + * * * + \u03c9u\u2217\u2032 \u03c9v\u2217\u2032 +\n\nr X\nX\n\n\u03c9k\u2217\u03c9w\u2217\n\nk=1 w\u2208W\n\nk=1\n\nwhere W is the set of indices that are not represented above. Then \u03c6 and \u03c8\nare coevents that agree on singleton and doubleton sets. By (2.2) \u03c6 and \u03c8\ncoincide.\nWe now illustrate Theorem 3.3 with an example. Let \u03a9 = {\u03c91 , . . . , \u03c95 }\nand suppose \u03c6 \u2208 A\u2217 satisfies \u03c6(\u03c91 ) = \u03c6(\u03c92 ) = 1,\n\u03c6 ({\u03c91 , \u03c92 }) = \u03c6 ({\u03c92 , \u03c93 }) = \u03c6 ({\u03c94 , \u03c95 }) = 1\nand \u03c6 is 0 for all other singleton and doubleton sets. Define \u03c8 \u2208 A\u2217 by\n\u03c8 = \u03c91\u2217 + \u03c92\u2217 + \u03c91\u2217 \u03c92\u2217 + \u03c94\u2217\u03c95\u2217 + \u03c91\u2217 \u03c93\u2217 + \u03c91\u2217 \u03c94\u2217 + \u03c91\u2217\u03c95\u2217 + \u03c92\u2217 \u03c94\u2217 + \u03c92\u2217 \u03c95\u2217\nThen \u03c6 and \u03c8 are coevents that agree on singleton and doubleton sets so by\n(2.2) \u03c6 and \u03c8 coincide.\nThe next result follows from the proof of Theorem 3.3.\nCorollary 3.4. Given any assignment of zeros and ones to the singleton and\ndoubleton sets of \u03a9 = {\u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9n }, there exists a unique coevent \u03c6 : A \u2192 Z2\nthat has these values.\nIt follows from Theorem 3.3 that the anhomomorphic logic A\u2217 is a vector\nspace over Z2 with dimension\n\u0012 \u0013\nn(n + 1)\nn\n\u2217\n=\ndim(A ) = n +\n2\n2\nHence, the cardinality of A\u2217 is 2n(n+1)/2 which is much smaller than the\nn\ncardinality 22 of the set of all 1-0 functions on \u03a9.\n10\n\n\fLemma 3.5. (a) \u03c6 : A \u2192 Z2 is grade-1 additive if and only if \u03c6(A \u222a B) =\n\u03c6(A) + \u03c6(B) + \u03c6(AB) for all A, B \u2208 A and \u03c6(\u2205) = 0.

It is easy to see that the map \u03bb in this result is not unique.\nTheorem 3.6. \u03c6 : A \u2192 Z2 is a coevent if and only if there exists a grade-1\nadditive map \u03bb : A \u00d7 A \u2192 Z2 such that \u03c6(A) = \u03bb(A \u00d7 A) for all A \u2208 A.\nProof. If \u03c6 : A \u2192 Z2 is a coevent, then by Theorem 3.3, \u03c6 has the form\nX\nX\n\u03c6=\n\u03b1i\u2217 +\n\u03b2i\u2217 \u03b3i\u2217\n\nfor \u03b1i , \u03b2i , \u03b3i \u2208 \u03a9. Define \u03bb : A \u00d7 A \u2192 Z2 by\nX\nX\n\u03bb=\n(\u03b1i \u00d7 \u03b1i )\u2217 +\n(\u03b2i \u00d7 \u03b3j )\u2217\n\nThen by Theorem 2.1(a), \u03bb is grade-1 additive and by Lemma 3.5(a), \u03bb(A \u00d7\nA) = \u03c6(A) for all A \u2208 A. Conversely, suppose \u03bb : A \u00d7 A \u2192 Z2 is grade-1\nadditive. By Theorem 2.1(a), \u03bb has the form\nX\n\u03bb=\n(\u03b1i \u00d7 \u03b2j )\u2217\nIf \u03c6 : A \u2192 Z2 satisfies \u03c6(A) = \u03bb(A \u00d7 A), then\nX\nX\n\u03c6(A) =\n(\u03b1i \u00d7 \u03b2j )\u2217 (A \u00d7 A) =\n\u03b1i\u2217 (A)\u03b2j\u2217 (A)\nX\nX\n=\n\u03b1i\u2217 (A) +\n(\u03b1i\u2217 \u03b2j\u2217 )(A)\n\nwhere the first summation on the right side is when \u03b1i = \u03b2j . It follows from\nTheorem 2.1(b) that \u03c6 is a coevent.\nWe now briefly discuss the possible strange behavior of coevents. Taking\nthe particle location interpretation, the \"superposition\" \u03c91\u2217 + \u03c92\u2217 states that\nthe particle is at position 1 and at position 2 but not at 1 or 2. The \"entanglement\" \u03c91\u2217\u03c92\u2217 states that the particle is at position 1 or at position 2 but\nif we look closely, it is not at either 1 or 2.\n\n4\n\nProjections and Observables\n\nIn the sequel, \u03a9 = {\u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9n } is a finite set, A is the Boolean algebra\nof all subsets of \u03a9 and A\u2217 is the anhomomorphic logic. We have seen in\nSection 3 that A\u2217 is a n(n + 1)/2 dimensional vector space over Z2 with\n12\n\n\fbasis consisting of the additive terms \u03c9i\u2217 and the quadratic terms \u03c9i\u2217\u03c9j\u2217 . A\nprojection on A\u2217 is a linear (or additive) idempotent map P : A\u2217 \u2192 A\u2217 . That\nis, P (\u03c6 + \u03c8) = P \u03c6 + P \u03c8 for all \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 A\u2217 and P 2 = P P = P . We denote\nthe set of all projections on A\u2217 by P(A\u2217 ). If P, Q \u2208 P(A\u2217 ) with P Q = QP ,\nthen it is clear that P + Q and P Q are again projections. For P \u2208 P(A\u2217 )\nwe define P \u2032 \u2208 P(A\u2217 ) by P \u2032 = I + P . For P, Q \u2208 P(A\u2217 ) we define P \u2264 Q if\nP Q = QP = P . We call a partially ordered set a poset. The greatest lower\nbound and least upper bound (if they exist) in a poset are denoted by P \u2227 Q\nand P \u2228 Q, respectively. For related work we refer the reader to [17]\nTheorem 4.1. (a) (P(A\u2217 ), \u2264) is a poset. (b) For P, Q \u2208 P(A\u2217 ) we have\nthat P \u2032\u2032 = P , P \u2227 P \u2032 = 0 and P \u2264 Q implies Q\u2032 \u2264 P \u2032. (c) If P Q = QP then\nP \u2227 Q = P Q and P \u2228 Q = P + Q + P Q.\nProof. (a) Clearly, P \u2264 P for all P \u2208 P(A\u2217 ). If P \u2264 Q and Q \u2264 P , then\nP = P Q = QP = Q\nIf P \u2264 Q and Q \u2264 R then\nP R = P QR = P Q = P\nand\nRP = RQP = QP = P\nHence, P \u2264 R so (P(A\u2217 ), \u2264) is a poset. (b) Clearly P \u2032\u2032 = P . If P \u2264 Q, then\n(I + P )(I + Q) = I + P + Q + P Q = I + P + Q + P = I + Q\nSimilarly, (I + Q)(I + P ) = I + Q so Q\u2032 \u2264 P \u2032 . If Q \u2264 P, P \u2032, then\nQ = QP \u2032 = Q(I + P ) = Q + QP = Q + Q = 0\nHence, P \u2227 P \u2032 = 0. (c) Since\n(P Q)P = (QP )P = QP = P Q\nwe have that P Q \u2264 P and similarly P Q \u2264 Q. Suppose that R \u2208 P(A\u2217 ) with\nR \u2264 P, Q. Then\nRP Q = RQ = R\nso that R \u2264 P Q. Hence, P \u2227 Q = P Q. By DeMorgan's law we have that\nP \u2228 Q = (P \u2032 \u2227 Q\u2032 )\u2032 = (P \u2032Q\u2032 )\u2032 = I + (I + P )(I + Q)\n= I + I + P + Q + PQ = P + Q + PQ\n13\n\n\fA poset (P, \u2264) with a mapping \u2032 : P \u2192 P satisfying the conditions of\nTheorem 4.1(b) is called an orthocomplemented poset. If P \u2264 Q\u2032 we write\nP \u22a5 Q and say that P and Q are orthogonal. Of course, P \u22a5 Q if and only\nif Q \u22a5 P . An orthocomplemented poset (P, \u2264, \u2032 ) is called an orthomodular\nposet if for P, Q \u2208 P we have that P \u22a5 Q implies P \u2228 Q exists and P \u2264 Q\nimplies\nQ = P \u2228 (Q \u2227 P \u2032)\nTheorem 4.2. (a) For P, Q \u2208 P(A\u2217 ), P \u22a5 Q if and only if P Q = QP = 0.\n(b) (P(A\u2217 ), \u2264, \u2032 ) is an orthomodular poset.\nProof. (a) If P \u22a5 Q, then\nP = P (I + Q) = P + P Q\nAdding P to both sides gives P Q = 0. Similarly, QP = 0. If P Q = QP = 0,\nthen\nP (I + Q) = P + P Q = P\nSimilarly, (I + Q)P = P so P \u2264 Q\u2032 . (b) If P \u22a5 Q, then by (a) we have that\nP Q = QP = 0. Hence, by Theorem 4.1(c) we conclude that P \u2228 Q exists\nand P \u2228 Q = P + Q. Now assume that P \u2264 Q. Since Q\u2032 \u2264 P \u2032 we have that\nQ\u2032 \u22a5 P . Hence, as before P \u2228 Q\u2032 exists. It follows that Q \u2227 P \u2032 = (P \u2228 Q\u2032 )\u2032\nexists. Since\nP \u2264 P \u2228 Q\u2032 = (Q \u2227 P \u2032 )\u2032\nwe have that P \u22a5 Q \u2227 P \u2032 . Hence, P \u2228 (Q \u2227 P \u2032 ) = P + Q \u2227 P \u2032 exists. By\nTheorem 4.1(c) we have that\nQ \u2227 P \u2032 = QP \u2032 = Q(I + P ) = Q + P Q\nTherefore\nQ = P + (Q + P ) = P + Q + P Q = P + Q \u2227 P \u2032 = P \u2228 (Q \u2227 P \u2032)\nIt follows that (P(A\u2217 ), \u2264, \u2032 ) is an orthomodular poset.\nAn orthomodular poset is frequently called a \"quantum logic.\" Quantum\nlogics have been studied for over 45 years in the foundations of quantum\nmechanics [1, 3, 7, 9, 10, 11, 18]. It is interesting that the present formalism\nis related to this older approach. In the quantum logic approach the elements of P(A\u2217 ) are thought of as quantum propositions or events. When we\n14\n\n\flater consider observables we shall see that there is a natural correspondence\nbetween elements of A and some of the elements of P(A\u2217 ). These elements\nof P(A\u2217 ) then become quantum generalizations of the events in A. In accordance with the quantum logic approach we say that P, Q \u2208 P(A\u2217 ) are\ncompatible if there exist mutually orthogonal elements P1 , Q1 , R \u2208 P(A\u2217 )\nsuch that P = R1 \u2228 R and Q = Q1 \u2228 R. Compatible events describe events\nthat can occur in a single measurement [9, 10, 11].\nTheorem 4.3. P, Q \u2208 P(A\u2217 ) are compatible if and only if P Q = QP .\nProof. If P, Q are compatible, there exist P1 , Q1 and R \u2208 P(A\u2217 ) satisfying\nthe given conditions. Then P = P1 + R, Q = Q1 + R so by Theorem 4.2(a)\nwe have that\nP Q = (P1 + R)(Q1 + R) = P1 Q1 + P1 R + RQ1 + R = R\nSimilarly, QP = R. Conversely, suppose that P Q = QP . Define R = P Q,\nP1 = P + P Q, Q1 = Q + P Q. It is easy to check that P1 , Q1 and R\nare mutually orthogonal elements of P(A\u2217 ). Applying Theorem 4.1(c) we\nconclude that\nP = (P + P Q) + P Q = P1 + R = P1 \u2228 R\nand\nQ = (Q + P Q) + P Q = Q1 + R = Q1 \u2228 R\nHence, P and Q are compatible.\nIn the quantum logic approach, instead of P(A\u2217 ) we frequently have the\nprojective space P(H) of orthogonal (self-adjoint) projections on a complex\nHilbert space H. For P, Q \u2208 P(H) we define P \u2264 Q if P = P Q. It is\nwell-known that Theorems 4.2 and 4.3 hold for (P(H), \u2264). However, it does\nnot immediately follow that these theorems hold for (P(A\u2217 ), \u2264) because the\nstructure of the vector space A\u2217 over Z2 is quite different than that of an\ninner product space over the complex field C. Also, P(A\u2217 ) consists of all\nprojections on A\u2217 while P(H) consists of only orthogonal projections. This\nis illustrated in Example 1 at the end of this section.\nFor further emphasis we give some examples of the differences between\nP(A\u2217 ) and P(H). For commuting projections P, Q \u2208 P(A\u2217 ) we have P +\n15\n\n\fQ \u2208 P(A\u2217 ) which is not true in P(H). For P, Q \u2208 P(H) if P Q = 0 then\nP Q = QP which is not true in P(A\u2217 ) as is shown in Example 1 at the end\nof this section. Theorem 4.1(c) does not hold in (P(H), \u2264). Finally, it is\nknown that (P(H), \u2264) is a lattice (P \u2227 Q and P \u2228 Q always exist). However,\nit is not known whether P(A\u2217 ) is a lattice and this would be an interesting\nproblem to investigate.\b\nWe have seen that \u03c9i\u2217 , \u03c9i\u2217\u03c9j\u2217 : i, j = 1, . . . , n forms a basis for the vector\nspace A\u2217 . For \u03c9i \u2208 \u03a9 define the map P (\u03c9i ) : A\u2217 \u2192 A\u2217 by P (\u03c9i )\u03c9j\u2217 = \u03c9i\u2217\u03c9j\u2217 ,\nP (\u03c9i )\u03c9i\u2217 \u03c9j\u2217 = P (\u03c9i )\u03c9j\u2217 \u03c9i\u2217 = \u03c9i\u2217 \u03c9j\u2217\nand for i, j, k distinct P (\u03c9i )\u03c9j\u2217\u03c9k\u2217 = 0 and extended P (\u03c9i ) to A\u2217 by linearity.\nIt is easy to check that P (\u03c9i ) \u2208 P(A\u2217 ), i = 1, . . . , n. Moreover, one can check\nthat P (\u03c9i ) + P (\u03c9j ) \u2208 P(A\u2217 ) and that P (\u03c9i )P (\u03c9j ) = P (\u03c9j )P (\u03c9i ) \u2208 P(A\u2217 ).\nFor A \u2208 A define P (A) : A\u2217 \u2192 A\u2217 by\nX\nP (A) =\n{P (\u03c9i ) + P (\u03c9i )P (\u03c9j ) : \u03c9i , \u03c9j \u2208 A, i < j}\n\nIt follows that P (A) \u2208 P(A\u2217 ) for all A \u2208 A. For example,\n\nP ({\u03c91 , \u03c92 , \u03c93 })\n= P (\u03c91 ) + P (\u03c92) + P (\u03c93 ) + P (\u03c91)P (\u03c92 ) + P (\u03c91 )P (\u03c93) + P (\u03c92 )P (\u03c93)\nThe map P : A \u2192 P(A\u2217 ) given by A 7\u2192 P (A) is called the master observable.\nBy convention P (\u2205) = 0 and one can verify that P (A)P (B) = P (B)P (A) for\nall A, B \u2208 A.\nIn general, P (*) is not additive or multiplicative. For example letting\nA = {\u03c91 }, B = {\u03c92 } we have that\nP (AB) = 0 6= \u03c91\u2217 \u03c92\u2217 = P (A)P (B)\nand\nP (A + B) = P ({\u03c91 , \u03c92 }) = \u03c91\u2217 + \u03c92\u2217 + \u03c91\u2217\u03c92\u2217\n6= \u03c91\u2217 + \u03c92\u2217 = P (A) + P (B)\nAs usual, we call a function f : \u03a9 \u2192 R a random variable. A random variable\ncorresponds to a measurement applied to the physical system described by\n(\u03a9, A). Denoting the Borel algebra of subsets of R by B(R), for a random\nvariable f , we define P f : B(R) \u2192 P(A\u2217 ) by P f (B) = P [f \u22121 (B)]. Thus,\nP f = P \u25e6 f \u22121 and we call P f the observable corresponding to f . The next\nresult summarizes the properties of P (*).\n16\n\n\fTheorem 4.4. (a) P (A \u222a B) = P (A) \u2228 P (B) = P (A) + P (B) + P (A)P (B)\nfor all A, B \u2208 A. (b) P (*) is unital, that is, P (\u03a9) = I. (c) P (*) is strongly\nmonotone, that is, P (A) \u2264 P (B) if and only if A \u2286 B.

Hence, P (\u03a9)\u03c6 = \u03c6 for all \u03c6 \u2208 A\u2217 so P (\u03a9) = I. (c) If A \u2286 B, then\nby (a) we have\nP (B) = P (A \u222a B) = P (A) + P (B) + P (A)P (B)\nHence, P (A)P (B) = P (B)P (A) = P (A) so P (A) \u2264 P (B).

Our observable terminology is at odds with the usual\n\"intrinsic\" point of view which is observation (or measurement) independent\nand one can think of P (*) as a mathematical construct and not refer to it as\nan observable.\n\n5\n\nPreclusion\n\nFor a physical system described by (\u03a9, A) there are frequently theoretical or\nexperimental reasons for excluding certain sets A, B, . . . \u2208 A from consideration. Such sets are said to be precluded. For example, one may have an\nunderlying quantum measure \u03bc on A and sets of measure zero (\u03bc(A) = 0) or\nsets of small measure (\u03bc(A) \u2248 0) may be precluded [5, 13, 14, 15]. In a physically realistic situation, precluded events should not occur. By convention\nwe assume that \u2205 is precluded.\nLet Ap \u2286 A be the set of precluded events. We say that a coevent \u03c6 \u2208 A\u2217\nis preclusive if \u03c6(A) = 0 for all A \u2208 Ap . The set of preclusive coevents form a\nsubspace A\u2217p of A\u2217 and considering A\u2217p gives an important way of reducing the\npossible realities for a physical system [5, 14, 15]. We now present another\nway of reducing the possible realities. If Ap = {A1 , . . . , Am } we say that\n\u03c6 \u2208 A\u2217 is precluding if P (A1 \u222a * * * \u222a Am )\u03c6 = 0. Thus, \u03c6 is precluding if and\nonly if \u03c6 is in the null space of P (A1 \u222a * * * \u222a Am ). This is again a subspace of\nA\u2217 which we will later show is contained in A\u2217p . Applying Theorems 4.1(c)\nand 4.4(a) we have that\n\u2032\n\nP (A1 \u222a * * * \u222a Am ) = \u2228P (Ai ) = [\u2227P (Ai )\u2032 ] = [P (A1 )\u2032 * * * P (Am )\u2032 ]\n= I + [I + P (A1 )] * * * [I + P (Am )]\n\n\u2032\n\nIt follows that \u03c6 is precluding if and only if\nP (A1 )\u2032 * * * P (Am )\u2032 \u03c6 = \u03c6\nThus, the precluding coevents are precisely the coevents in the range of the\nprojection P (A1 )\u2032 * * * P (Am )\u2032 .\nTheorem 5.1. (a) If P (A)\u03c6 = 0, then \u03c6(A) = 0 for A \u2208 A, \u03c6 \u2208 A\u2217 .\n(b) If \u03c6 is precluding, the \u03c6 is preclusive.\n19\n\n\fProof. (a) Without loss of generality we can assume that A = {\u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9m }\nand that\n\u2217\n\u03c6 = a1 \u03c91\u2217 + * * * + an \u03c9n\u2217 + b12 \u03c91\u2217 \u03c92\u2217 + * * * + bn\u22121,n \u03c9n\u22121\n\u03c9n\u2217\n\nfor ai , bij \u2208 Z2 . Since\nP (A)\u03c6 = [P (\u03c91 ) + * * * + P (\u03c9m ) + P (\u03c91 )P (\u03c92) + * * * + P (\u03c9m\u22121)P (\u03c9m )] \u03c6 = 0\nwe have that a1 = * * * = am = 0, bij = 0 for i, j \u2264 m and aj + bij = 0 for\nj > m, i \u2264 m. We conclude that \u03c6 has the form\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03c6 = am+1 \u03c9m+1 + * * * + an \u03c9n\u2217 + am+1 \u03c9m+1\n\u03c91\u2217 + * * * + am+1 \u03c9m+1\n\u03c9m\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n+ am+2 \u03c9m+2\n\u03c91\u2217 + * * * + am+2 \u03c9m+2\n\u03c9m\n+ an \u03c9n\u2217 \u03c91\u2217 + * * * + an \u03c9n\u2217 \u03c9m\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n+ bm+1,m+2 \u03c9m+1\n\u03c9m+2\n+ * * * + bn\u22121,n \u03c9n\u22121\n\u03c9n\u2217\n\nIt follows that \u03c6(A) = 0. (b) Assume that Ap = {A1 , . . . , Am }. If \u03c6 is\nprecluding, then P (A1 \u222a* * *\u222aAm )\u03c6 = 0. By Theorem 4.4(c) P (*) is monotone\nso that\nP (Ai )\u03c6 = P (Ai )P (A1 \u222a * * * \u222a Am )\u03c6 = 0\nfor i = 1, . . . , m. By (a) we have that \u03c6(Ai ) = 0, i = 1, . . . , m. Hence,\n\u03c6 \u2208 A\u2217p .\nA precluding basis is a set S of precluding coevents such that every precluding coevent is a sum of elements of S. The definition of a preclusive basis\nis similar. Although such bases are not unique, they give an efficient way of\ndescribing all precluding (or preclusive) coevents.\nExample 2. Let \u03a9 = {\u03c91 , \u03c92 , \u03c93 } and Ap = {\u2205, {\u03c91 , \u03c92}}. It is easy to\ncheck that a preclusive basis consists of \u03c93\u2217, \u03c91\u2217 \u03c93\u2217 , \u03c92\u2217\u03c93\u2217 , \u03c91\u2217 + \u03c92\u2217 , \u03c91\u2217 + \u03c91\u2217\u03c92\u2217 .\nTo find the precluding coevents we let A = {\u03c91 , \u03c92 } and solve the equation\nP (A)\u03c6 = 0. Thus,\n[P (\u03c91) + P (\u03c92 ) + P (\u03c91 )P (\u03c92)] (a\u03c91\u2217 + b\u03c92\u2217 + c\u03c93\u2217 + d\u03c91\u2217\u03c92\u2217 + e\u03c91\u2217 \u03c93\u2217 + f \u03c92\u2217 \u03c93\u2217)\n= a\u03c91\u2217 + b\u03c91\u2217 \u03c92\u2217 + c\u03c91\u2217 \u03c93\u2217 + d\u03c91\u2217\u03c92\u2217 + e\u03c91\u2217 \u03c93\u2217 + a\u03c91\u2217 \u03c92\u2217 + b\u03c92\u2217\n+ c\u03c92\u2217 \u03c93\u2217 + d\u03c91\u2217\u03c92\u2217 + f \u03c92\u2217 \u03c93\u2217 + a\u03c91\u2217 \u03c92\u2217 + b\u03c91\u2217 \u03c92\u2217 + d\u03c91\u2217\u03c92\u2217 )\n=0\n\n20\n\n\fIt follows that a = b = d = 0, c + e = c + f = 0. Hence,\n\u03c6 = c\u03c93\u2217 + c\u03c91\u2217\u03c93\u2217 + c\u03c92\u2217 \u03c93\u2217\nso the only nonzero precluding coevent is\n\u03c6 = \u03c93\u2217 + \u03c91\u2217\u03c93\u2217 + \u03c92\u2217 \u03c93\u2217\nOf course, \u03c6 is a precluding basis. Notice that \u03c6 is unital. This example\nshows that preclusive coevents need not be precluding.\nExample 3. Let \u03a9 = {\u03c91 , \u03c92 , \u03c93 } and Ap = {\u2205, {\u03c91 } , {\u03c92 }}. A preclusive\nbasis consists of \u03c93\u2217, \u03c91\u2217 \u03c93\u2217 , \u03c92\u2217\u03c93\u2217 , \u03c91\u2217\u03c92\u2217 . The only nonzero precluding coevent\nis \u03c6 obtained in Example 2. This is because\nA = {\u03c91 , \u03c92 } = {\u03c91 } \u222a {\u03c92 }\nExample 4. Let \u03a9 = {\u03c9! , \u03c92 , \u03c93 } and let Ap = {\u2205, A} where A = {\u03c91 }.\nTo find the precluding coevents we solve the equation P (A)\u03c6 = 0. Thus,\nP (\u03c91 ) [a\u03c91\u2217 + b\u03c92\u2217 + c\u03c93\u2217 + d\u03c91\u2217\u03c92\u2217 + e\u03c91\u2217 \u03c93\u2217 + f \u03c92\u2217\u03c93\u2217 ]\n= a\u03c91\u2217 + b\u03c91\u2217 \u03c92\u2217 + c\u03c91\u2217\u03c93\u2217 + d\u03c91\u2217 \u03c92\u2217 + e\u03c91\u2217 \u03c93\u2217 = 0\nHence, a = b + d = c + e = 0. We conclude that \u03c6 has the form\n\u03c6 = b\u03c92\u2217 + c\u03c93\u2217 + b\u03c91\u2217 \u03c92\u2217 + c\u03c91\u2217 \u03c93\u2217 + f \u03c92\u2217 \u03c93\u2217\nThus, a precluding basis consists of \u03c92\u2217 \u03c93\u2217 , \u03c92\u2217 + \u03c91\u2217 \u03c92\u2217 and \u03c93\u2217 + \u03c91\u2217 \u03c93\u2217. The\nlast two are not unital but sums with \u03c92\u2217\u03c93\u2217 are unital.\nWe now discuss events B that can actually occur. That is there exists\na preclusive or precluding coevent \u03c6 such that \u03c6(B) = 1. It would be nice\nif whenever B is not precluded, then such a \u03c6 exists. But this is asking too\nmuch as simple examples show. However, we do have the following result\nwhich gives a kind of duality between preclusive and precluding coevents.\nTheorem 5.2. Let Ap = {A1 , . . . , Am }, A = A1 \u222a * * * \u222a Am and B \u2208 A.\n(a) If BA\u2032 6= \u2205 then there exists a preclusive coevent \u03c6 such that \u03c6(B) = 1.\n(b) If there exists a precluding coevent \u03c6 such that \u03c6(B) = 1, then BA\u2032 6= \u2205.\n\n21\n\n\fProof. (a) If \u03c9 \u2208 BA\u2032 , then \u03c9 \u2208 BA\u2032i , i = 1, . . . , m. Hence, \u03c9 \u2217 (B) = 1 and\n\u03c9 \u2217 (Ai ) = 0, i = 1, . . . , m. We conclude that \u03c9 \u2217 is preclusive. (b) Suppose\nBA\u2032 = \u2205. Then B \u2286 A and if \u03c6 is precluding, then P (A)\u03c6 = 0. Hence, by\nTheorem 4.4(c) we have\nP (B)\u03c6 = P (B)P (A)\u03c6 = 0\nApplying Theorem 5.1(a), we conclude that \u03c6(B) = 0. Hence, there is no\nprecluding coevent \u03c6 such that \u03c6(B) = 1. We have thus proved the contrapositive of (b) so (b) holds.\nCorollary 5.3. Let Ap = {A1 , . . . , Am }, A = A1 \u222a * * * Am and B \u2208 A.\n(a) If \u03c6(B) = 0 for every preclusive \u03c6, then B \u2286 A. (b) If B \u2286 A, then\n\u03c6(B) = 0 for every precluding \u03c6.\nThe result in Theorem 5.2(a) does not hold if preclusive is replaced by\nprecluding. In Example 4, A1 = {\u03c91 } is the only nonempty precluded event.\nLetting B = {\u03c91 , \u03c92 } we have that BA\u2032 = {\u03c92 } =\n6 \u2205. However, all the\nprecluding coevents listed in Example 4 vanish on B. Hence, \u03c6(B) = 0\nfor all precluding coevents. The result in Theorem 5.2(b) does not hold if\nprecluding is replaced by preclusive. In Example 2, letting A = {\u03c91 , \u03c92 } and\nB = {\u03c91 }, \u03c6 = \u03c91\u2217 + \u03c92\u2217 is preclusive and \u03c6(B) = 1. However, BA\u2032 = \u2205.\nExamples 2 and 3 have the pleasant feature that there is a unique nonzero\nprecluding coevent. However, the next example shows that there can be many\npreclusive coevents and no nonzero precluding coevent.\nExample 5. In the three-slit experiment \u03a9 = {\u03c91 , \u03c92 , \u03c93 } considered\npreviously, suppose {\u03c91 , \u03c92 } and {\u03c92 , \u03c93 } are the only nonempty precluded\nevents. Since\n\u03a9 = {\u03c91 , \u03c92} \u222a {\u03c92 , \u03c93 }\nwe have that \u03c6 is precluding if and only if \u03c6 = P (\u03a9)\u03c6 = 0 so the only\nprecluding coevent is 0. However, there are many preclusive coevents. For\nexample, \u03c91\u2217 + \u03c92\u2217 + \u03c93\u2217, \u03c91\u2217 + \u03c91\u2217\u03c92\u2217 , \u03c93\u2217 + \u03c92\u2217\u03c93\u2217 , \u03c91\u2217\u03c93\u2217 form a preclusive basis.\nIt should be mentioned that in previous works it has usually been assumed\nthat the union of mutually disjoint precluded events is precluded. However,\nwe did not make this assumption here.\n\nAcknowledgement. The author thanks R.
