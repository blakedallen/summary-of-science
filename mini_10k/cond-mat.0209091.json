In the polar semiconductor samples of the self-organized quantum dots, grown by the Stranski-Krastanow growth method, the lowest\nenergy extended states of the electronic excitations are assumed to be the\nwetting-layer states. The coupling between these extended states and the\nelectronic states localized in the individual quantum dots, may influence\nthe optical spectra of such samples in the sub-wetting layer region of energy. This effect is studied assuming the Fr\u00f6hlich's coupling between the\nelectrons and polar optical phonons. The contribution of this interaction to\nthe appearence of the sub-wetting layer continuum in the optical spectra\nand to the level broadening of the localized states, pointed out in some\nexperiments, is estimated.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe semiconductor nanoparticles are promissing from the point of view of\nboth basic science and applications [1]. One of their significant features is\nthat the charge carriers can be localized within these nanoparticles. The\nquantum dots are thus regarded as a realization of artificial atoms with\nthe nearly delta function-like spectral density of the electronic states. The\nquantum dot aggregates are prepared very often by the Stranski-Krastanow\ngrowth technique [1]. In the self-assembled quantum dot (SAQD) samples,\nprepared by this method, the quantum dots are grown on the top of the\nwetting layer (WL), with which the quantum dots interact. The optical\nabsorption spectra of nanoparticles dispersed in a polymer film, which also\nseem to display an absorption continuum background increasing with the\nenergy of the absorbed photon [2, 3], are not discussed here.\n\n\f2\nIn the type I quantum dots [1] in the undoped SAQD samples, the\nlowest energy excitations are the states with the electrons excited over\nthe semiconductor band gap to the conduction band electronic quantum\ndot localized states, leaving the holes in the valence-band states of the\nquantum dot. In the SAQD samples it is expected that the lowest energy\nelectronic excitations, which are not localized in the quantum dots, are the\nexcitations to the wetting layer states [4, 5]. The scheme of the electronic\nstates available to the electronic excitations in the SAQD samples is drawn\nin the Fig. 1.\nThe electronic system can also be excited to the extended states belonging to the substrate and to the electronic states in the cladding layers [6].\nWith a certain simplification, the electronic states localized in the quantum\ndots can be expected to have a delta function like density of states. This\nmay be seen in contrast with experiments [4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\nshowing that the spectral densities may be different from delta functions\nand that the width of them may depend on the intensity of laser light excitating the SAQD sample. Besides this observation, the experiments on\nluminescence and optical absorption suggest that in the sub-wetting layer\nenergy region, where we expect only bound electronic states, a continuum\nbackground is observed.\nThe continuous background, which seems characteristic of the SAQD\nsamples, occurs often in the measurements on samples with a rather high\ndensity of the quantum dots and a large density of electrons excited to the\nWL states [14]. The presence of high densities of charge carriers may lead us\nto consider the electrostatic coupling among the charge carriers [15, 16, 17].\nWe shall not consider this mechanism in the present work. Also, we shall\nneglect any direct coupling between quantum dots, like the electron tunneling [18], electrostatic coupling between the dots, or any other. Recently,\nthe Fr\u00f6hlich's coupling [19] between the electrons and dispersionless polar optical phonons has been applied to the interpretation of the energy\nrelaxation of electrons in quantum dots [20, 21] and to other properties\n[20, 22, 23]. The theory of the energy relaxation in the two level system\nwith the dispersionless phonons has recently been supported by an exact\ncalculation [24]. The purpose of this work is to show the possible contribution of the Fr\u00f6hlich's coupling to the origin of the sub-WL continuous\nbackground spectral density and to the electronic level broadening in the\nSAQD samples.\n2. The theoretical model of the SAQD system\nTrying to study the optical spectra in the rather complicated samples, as\nthe SAQD are, we are led to make a number of simplifications, which make\n\n\f3\n\n11111111111111111111111\n00000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000\n11111111111111111111111\n00000000000000000000000\n11111111111111111111111\n00000000000000000000000\n11111111111111111111111\n00000000000000000000000\n11111111111111111111111\nWL states\n00000000000000000000000\n11111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n00000000000000000000000\n11111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\nE=0\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\nE LO\n\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n\nEn\n\n111\n000\nFigure 1.

En is the energy of a selected bound state in the sub-wetting layer energy region,\nELO is optical phonon energy.\n\nthe problem tractable, but which hopefully do not influence principally the\nmain conclusions of the work. Dealing with the electron-phonon Fr\u00f6hlich's\ninteraction we shall neglect the influence of the interfaces in the SAQD\nheterostructure on the structure of the optical phonons. From the reasons\ngiven e. g. in the ref. [25] we shall simply assume that the charge carriers\ninteract with the dispersionless longitudinal phonons of the bulk crystal of\nGaAs. Neglecting the effect of the electrostatic interaction among electrons\nand holes, we neglect also the exciton effect. We shall assume the limit of\nvery heavy holes, in which their influence is reduced only to the static electrostatic field contributing to the effective potential in which the electrons\nmove in the quantum dot potential in the conduction band.\nIn order that the details of the present model Hamiltonian are better\nunderstood, let us remind the principal features of the structure of the\nSAQD sample. With a certain simplification, in the Stranski-Krastanow\nmethod the surface of a substrate is first covered by a thin layer of the material, called wetting-layer, from which the quantum dots are to be grown.\nAfter depositing this layer the sample is left to obey a spontaneous process.\n\n\f4\nIn this process the wetting layer changes its structure, namely, due to the\ndifference in the lattice constant between the substrate material and that\nof the wetting layer, the wetting layer starts to become thinner and the\nmaterial of the wetting layer forms small nanocrystals on the top of the\nwetting-layer. These small nanostructures may have sometimes a shape of\na pyramid. Because of the shape and the size these small structures are\ncalled quantum dots. The process stops at some size of the nanocrystals\nand at some remaining thickness of the wetting-layer. The final state is a\nresult of an enegretic equilibrium in the whole system of the interatomic\nforces of the system. In order to prevent the mutual transfer of the matterial between the wetting layer and the quantum dots after the growth\nis ended, all the structure is covered from the top by a capping layer of\na material, which can be similar to the substrate material. In this structure the electrons appear to be localized in the quantum dots. In order to\novercome this localization they either have to gain an energy to transfer to\nthe capping layer, or they need to get an energy sufficient for to transfer\nto the lowest energy states in the very thin weting layer. Because of the\nsmall thickness of the wetting layer, the lowest energies in this structure\nare rather large. Usually however, the lowest energetic barrier for the electron to leave the quantum dot is that to the wetting layer. The density of\nthe quantum dots, with which they are distributed on the surface of WL,\ndepends on the technological conditions of the Stranski-Krastanow process.\nThe wetting-layer is a quasi-two dimensional quantum well nanostructure. In the SAQD sample the electrons of the quantum dots are expected to\nbe coupled to electronic states of the wetting layer. The complete orthonormal set of the electronic states in the quantum dots and in the wetting layer\ndepend on the details of the geometry of the SAQD sample. Realizing that\nbesides the WL extended states there are also other extended states in the\nreal sample, namely those associated with the substrate and capping layers\n[4], which may be energetically not very far from the wetting-layer states,\nand in order to simplify the theory, we shall assume that the wetting layer is\na three-dimensional subsystem with the electronic states extended throughout the whole SAQD sample. The impact of this dimensionality assumption\ncan be verified by recalculating the present results with a two-dimensional\nwetting layer assumption. This will be postponed to a further work. Our\nmodel, using the three-dimensional wetting-layer continuum, may therefore correspond better to the vertically coupled three-dimensional stacks of\nthe quantum dots [26], or, to the Volmer-Weber island growth technology\nwithout the wetting layer (see e. g. [27]).\nWe shall approximate the electronic bound states in the individual dots\nby the electronic eigenstates in the three dimensional infinitely deep quantum wells. Although we shall assume that the density of the quantum dots\n\n\f5\nin the sample is rather high, namely 8\u00d71021 m\u22123 , which by the mean interdot distance corresponds to the usual two-dimensional density of quantum\ndots in the measured samples [13], we shall assume that the single electron states in the individual quantum dots are mutually orthogonal. In this\nwork, confining ourselves to the basic estimates, we shall need to consider\nonly one bound state per a single dot. In real samples, the individual quantum dots have only a finite potential depth. In our model we shall therefore\nassume that the single-electron spectrum in a quantum dot is shifted by a\ncertain energy, so that the energy of the bound state under consideration is\npositioned in the sub-wetting layer region of electronic energy and we shall\nneglect the other bound states in the dots.\nThe electronic motion in the WL states can be approximated by plane\nwaves, with the electronic energy Ek = h\u03042 | k |2 /(2m), m being the electron conduction band energy in GaAs. The plane waves together with the\nbound states would not make an orthogonal set of states. The problem of\nnonorthogonality of the basis can be approximately avoided upon restricting the magnitude k of the electron wave vectors k in the WL states to\nthe values k \u226a km . In this work we shall assume that the electronic wavelength corresponding to km is 1.5 \u2217 d, d being the lateral size of the cubic\nquantum dot. We assume d = 20 nm. In GaAs this assumption limits the\nWL electronic energy from above by about 24 meV.\nThe restriction put on the extent of the WL space of states will be\nutilized also in another context. We know little about the state of electronic\nstatistical distribution in the course of the experiment, so that we use a\nsimple assumption of the population of the WL states. Namely, we shall\nassume that the quantum mechanical electronic WL states are populated by\nelectrons with a homogeneous density Nk , independent of the electron wave\nvector. This homogeneity assumption simplifies the theoretical treatment in\na certain way. The overall density of of the WL electrons is then obviously\ndetermined by Nk and km .\nIn the above specified single-electron basis the full Hamiltonian consists\nof free electron Hamiltonian in the bound and WL states, He , free phonon\nHamiltonian, Hph , and the electron-phonon coupling H1 between them:\nH = He + Hph ,\nHe =\n\nX\n\nEn c+\ni,n ci,n +\n\nHph =\n\nX\n\nELO b+\nq bq ,\n\nH1 =\n\nX\n\ni,n\n\nX\n\nEk c+\nk ck ,\n\nk\n\nq\n\n\u03bb,\u03bc,q\n\n+\nAq \u03a6(\u03bb, \u03bc, q)(bq \u2212 b+\n\u2212q )c\u03bb c\u03bc ,\n\n(1)\n\n\f6\nHere \u03bb and \u03bc are the indexes of single electron states, either (i, n), or k,\nwhere i is the quantum dot number and n is the electron orbital number.\nc and b are, respectively, electron and phonon annihilation operators, ELO\nis phonon energy.

Because the\nFr\u00f6hlich's coupling does not change the electron spin, we treat the electronic\nsubsystems with the given spin separately. The functions \u03c8 are the single\nelectron orbitals in the SAQD sample. The terms of H1 corresponding the\nFr\u00f6hlich's coupling between two bound states localized in different quantum\ndots will be considered as zero.\n3. Spectral density\nWe shall calculate the electronic spectral density for the Hamiltonian specified above. This basic quantity will be used to compare the theoretical\nresults with some experimental data in photoluminescence, photoluminescence excitation and optical absorption experiments. The electronic spectral density \u03c3i,n (E), E being the energy variable, is related to the retarded\nGreen's function Gi,n (E) with help of the formula \u03c1i,n (E) = \u2212 \u03c01 ImGi,n (E).\nSimilarly, spectral densities and the corresponding Green's functions Gk (E)\nare introduced for the wetting layer electronic states.\nThe electronic Green's function can be determined by the corresponding\nelectronic self-energy, Mi,n (E). Only the diagonal terms, in the electronic\norbital quantum number n, of the Green's function and self-energies, will be\nconsidered. The reader is referred to the earlier works on the electron energy\nrelaxation in individual quantum dots [21, 28, 29, 30]. The bound states\nelectronic self-energy in the self-consistent Born approximation reads:\n1 \u2212 Ni,m + \u03bdLO\nE \u2212 Em \u2212 ELO \u2212 Mi,m (E \u2212 ELO )\nm\n\u001b\nNi,m + \u03bdLO\n+\nE \u2212 Em + ELO \u2212 Mi,m (E + ELO )\n\u001a\nX\n1 \u2212 Nk + \u03bdLO\n\u03b1n,k\n+\nE \u2212 Ek \u2212 ELO \u2212 Mk (E \u2212 ELO )\nk\n\nMi,n (E) =\n\nX\n\n\u03b1n,m\n\n\u001a\n\n\f7\n+\n\nNk + \u03bdLO\n,\nE \u2212 Ek + ELO \u2212 Mk (E + ELO )\n\u001b\n\n(4)\nwhile for the wetting layer electrons we have:\n1 \u2212 Nk\u2032 + \u03bdLO\nE \u2212 Ek\u2032 \u2212 ELO \u2212 Mk\u2032 (E \u2212 ELO )\nm\n\u001b\nNk\u2032 + \u03bdLO\n+\nE \u2212 Ek\u2032 + ELO \u2212 Mk\u2032 (E + ELO )\n\u001a\nX\n1 \u2212 Ni,s + \u03bdLO\n+\n\u03b1k,i,s\nE\n\u2212\nE\n\u2212\nELO \u2212 Mi,s (E \u2212 ELO )\ns\ni,s\n\nMk (E) =\n\n+\n\nX\n\n\u03b1k,k\u2032\n\n\u001a\n\nNi,s + \u03bdLO\n.\nE \u2212 Es + ELO \u2212 Mi,s (E + ELO )\n\u001b\n\n(5)\n\nHere i is the number of quantum dot, while n and s are the numbers of\nelectron bound state orbitals in the given dot. Ni,m is the number of electrons in the m-th state if i-th quantum dot, Nk is the number of electrons\nin the k-th state of the wetting-layer states and \u03bdLO is the population of\nthe optical phonon states of the sample, given here by the Bose-Einstein\ndistribution function. In these equations for the electronic self-energy, the\nconstants \u03b1 are generally given by\n\u03b1\u03bb,\u03bc =\n\nX\n\n| Aq |2 | \u03a6(\u03bc, \u03bb, q) |2 ,\n\n(6)\n\nq\n\nwhere the summation extends over all optical phonon wave vectors q. The\nabove equations for the electronic self-energy are self-consistent. Generally,\nthey correspond to including an infinite number of terms of the self-energy\nexpansion in the powers of H1 . The use of the self-consistency, corresponding to the inclusion of the multiple-phonon scattering, proved important in\nthe case of the electron-energy relaxation among the discrete energy levels\nof an electron in quantum dots [20, 21] and would be important when considering multiple bound states in a single dot, coupled via H1 . Those terms\nin the equations (4,5), corresponding to the scattering between one bound\nstate and one extended state, and those, corresponding to the scattering\nof the electron between two extended states, will be included in the bare\nBorn approximation only.\nLet us now specify the constants \u03b1 in the three specific cases of the\nchoice of the electronic states. In the case when both \u03bb and \u03bc denote the\nstates localized in the same quantum dot, \u03bb = (i, n), \u03bc = (i, m), we find\nthat the corresponding constant \u03b1n,m = \u03b1m,n in the equation (6) does not\n\n\f8\ndepend on the quantum dot site index i. This is because the form-factor\ndepends on the site index i in the following way:\n\u03a6((i, m), (i, n), q) = eiqr \u03a8(irr) (m, n, q),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the irreducible part of the form-factor is defined as\n\u03a8(irr) (m, n, q) =\n\nZ\n\n\u2217\nd3 r\u03c8(0,n)\n(r)eiqr \u03c8(0,m) (r).\n\n(8)\n\nHere the site index 0 means the position of the quantum dot at the origin\nof coordinates. We therefore drop out the site index i from the constant \u03b1\ncompletely for the coupling between the bound states, and we have:\n\u03b1nm =\n\nX\n\n| Aq |2 | \u03a8(irr) (m, n, q) |2 .\n\n(9)\n\nq\n\nThe constant \u03b1n,k = \u03b1k,n , which characterizes the mutual coupling of\nthe bound and extended states, is determined with help of the form-factor\n\u03a6((i, n), k, q) = V \u22121/2\n\nZ\n\nd3 reikr eiqr \u03c8m (r),\n\n(10)\n\nV is the volume of the sample. When the electron wave vector k is put zero,\nthe latter integral is the Fourier transform of the electronic wave function.\nBecause this wave function is localized in the cube of the lateral dimension\nd, the Fourier transform will be a function of q, the width of which in the\nq-space will be about \u03c0/d. Having confined our space of available extended\nstates to the plane waves the k-vectors of which fulfill the condition | k |\u226a\n\u03c0/d, we can expect that in the limit of k-vector going to zero, the magnitude\nof k in the form-factor \u03a6((i, n), k, q) will not have any important influence\non the value of the corresponding constant \u03b1. In practice we will assume\nthat | k |\u2264 km , 2\u03c0/km = 1.5 \u00d7 d. We get:\n\u03b1n,k \u2248 \u03b1n,k=0 =\n\nXX\n\n| Aq |2 | \u03a6(irr) (k = 0, n, q) |2 ,\n\n(11)\n\nq\n\nwhere\n\u03a6(irr) (k = 0, n, q) = V \u22121/2\n\nZ\n\nd3 reiqr \u03c80,n (r).\n\n(12)\n\nIt is then straightforward to get \u03b1n,k = Bn /V , where the constant Bn is\nBn =\n\n\u22121\ne2 ELO (\u03ba\u22121\n\u221e \u2212 \u03ba0 )\n|\n16\u03c0 3 \u03b50\n\nZ\n\nd3 qeiqr \u03c80n (r) |2 .\n\n(13)\n\n\f9\nIn the equation (5), the term which introduces the coupling between\nthe extended states, is (we just rewrite the original Fr\u00f6hlich's coupling)\n\u03b1k,k\u2032 \u2261\n\nX\n\n| Aq |2 | \u03a6(k, k\u2032 , q) |2 ,\n\n(14)\n\nq\n\nwith \u03a6(k, k\u2032 , q) = \u03b4k,k\u2032 ,+q .

The influence of the wetting layer states\nWe shall now consider the influence of the wetting layer states on the spectral density in the sub-wetting layer region of electronic energy. We have set\nthe bottom of the wetting layer states at the energy E = 0. The electronic\nstates localized in quantum dots are then at E < 0.\nInspecting the equations (4) and (5) we see that only some of the terms\nat the right hand side give singularities of the self-energy in the sub-wetting\nlayer region, in the lowest order of iteration of these equations. These terms\nare only the following ones: the term corresponding to the last fraction in\nequation (4) and similarly the term containing the second fraction in equation (5). These terms bring phonon satellites into the electronic spectral\ndensity at the sub-WL region. Also, these terms give a contribution, which is\nproportional to the electronic population of the wetting-layer states, which\nproperty appears to be connected with the presence of the discrete level\nbroadening in the sub-WL region [14].\nThe experiments, with which we wish to compare our results, are usually\nperformed at 10 K. Therefore, we take \u03bdLO = 0 for the population of the\nphonons. So that, unless the temperature of the lattice optical phonons is\nincreased substantially, the above self-energy terms are nonzero only when\nthere is a nonzero population of the wetting layer electron states. In the\npresent numerical estimates we shall assume a rather large population in\nthe wetting-layer states. The mechanism of achieving such a WL population\nis not discussed here in any detail. The large population of the WL states\ncorresponds to the numerical estimates in the experimental papers [14].\n4.1. A SINGLE BOUND STATE\n\nLet us see the influence of the wetting layer states on the spectral density of\na single bound electronic state. Let us assume the simple case, when there\nis only a single bound state in every quantum dot, which we denote as the\n\n\f10\n\nSpectral density (1/meV)\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\u221235\n\n\u221230\n\u221225\nEnergy (meV)\n\n\u221220\n\nFigure 2. Spectral density \u03c3n (E) of the bound state of a single quantum dot interacting\nwith the wetting-layer states at the WL polulation: Nk =0.25 (dotted line), 0.5 (dashed)\nand 0.75 (full).\n\nstate n = 2, the energy of which will be denoted as E2 and E2 = \u2212ELO + \u03b7.\nThe parameter \u03b7 determining the position of the bound state energy level\nis chosen to be 10 meV. In this work we use the material parameters of\nGallium Arsenide. Namely, the electron relative effective mass is 0.067, the\nstatic dielectric constant is \u03ba0 =12.91 (SI units) and the high frequency\ndielectric constant is \u03ba\u221e =10.91. The bulk crystal phonon energy in GaAs\nis 36.2 meV. The wave function of this state will be assumed to be that of\nan electron in one of the states of the triply degenerate first excited energy\nlevel of an infinitely deep cubic quantum dot with the lateral size d. Namely,\nthis wave function is\n\u03c802 (r) = (2/d)3/2 cos(\u03c0x/d)cos(\u03c0y/d)sin(2\u03c0z/d)\n\n(16)\n\n(reminding that the index 0 means the wave function placed at the origin of coordinates). The natural line width of the spectral density of the\nbound state is taken here to be \u2206 = 0.05 meV. The same natural line-width\nis assumed for the states in the wetting-layer. This means that the spectral density of the unperturbed bound state would be a Lorenzian, having\nthe halfwidth of 0.05 meV, being placed at the energy \u2212ELO + 10 meV.\nThe electronic self-energy term, expressed in the Born approximation to\nthe coupling between the bound state \u03c802 and the WL states, and being\n\n\f11\nproportional to the WL population at low temperatures, is simply\nMn (E) =\n\nX\nk\n\n\u03b1n,k\n\nNk\n.\nE \u2212 Ek + ELO + i\u2206\n\n(17)\n\nWe omit the index of the quantum dot here. As said above, we assume\nhere that the population of the WL states Nk is constant for all Nk . Under\nthe above made assumption, according to which the wetting-layer states\nk-vector magnitude is restricted to be not larger than km , this means that\nthe average density of the electrons (of both spins) is about 1.5\u00d71023 m\u22123\nfor Nk = 0.5. We assume that the electrons occupy only the WL states.\nReminding the above introduced approximation, according to which the\nwavevector dependence of the constant \u03b1n,k is neglected, the integral in the\nequation (17) can be integrated analytically [31]. The result of the numerical\nevaluation of the electronic spectral density \u03c3n (E) of the electronic state\nn = 2, bound in a quantum dot, is presented in Fig. 2 for three values of the\npopulation of the wetting layer states. The spectral peak of the bound state\nis broadened, from the unperturbed value of the full width at half maximum\nbeing 0.1 meV, to the value of about 2 meV. This spectral width is of the\nsame order of magnitude as it may be found in the experimental papers\n(see e. g. [14]. The Figure 2 shows the trend of the discrete state spectral\ndensity to broaden with the increase of the wetting layer states population.\nThis behaviour of the bound state line-width appears to be in accord with\nthe experiment [14]. The purpose of the present study is to pay attention\nto the main features of the effects under consideration. From this reason we\nuse the material parameters of GaAs, as a typical material among the polar\nsemiconductors. The quantum dot samples studied in experiment are often\nthe InGaAs quantum dots, and the corresponding weting layer, both grown\non the substrate of GaAs. Although the parameters characterizing InGaAs\nare rather similar to those of GaAs, we nevertheless do not compare our\nresults quantitatively with the experiment. In the case of the bound state\nenergy level broadenig, the reader is referred to the paper [14], namely to\nthe Figure 3 in that paper, for the experimental data on the level broadening\nas it depends indirectly on the WL electron density. Let us emphasize that\nin the experimental works, with which we compare our results, the optical\nspectra are obtained in such a way, that the they are measured in the limit\nof a single dot measurement and therefore the inhomogeneous broadening\nof the optical spectra is avoided. In this sense, we can therefore compare the\nexperimental data with our \"homogeneously\" broadened theoretical shape.\nBesides the broadening of the discrete electronic level, the coupling\nof the bound state to the WL states tends to give a weak continuous\nbackground. Quantitatively, this background appears rather weak at the\npresently used values of the input parameters of the material, quantum dot\n\n\f12\nsize and shape, and at the present assumption about the populated states\nin the wetting-layer continuum. We may conclude that, the interaction of\nthe bound state in the dot with the wetting layer states, under rather high\npopulation per quantum mechanical state, leads mainly to the bound state\nlevel broadening in the sub-wetting layer region.\n4.2. PHONON SATELLITE OF THE WETTING LAYER STATES\n\nWe do not pay attention to the changes of the spectral density in the WL\nregion, which come from the coupling of the WL states to the bound states.\nIn the absence of the quantum dots in the sample, the electron-phonon interaction between the wetting-layer states leads, as it is well known [32],\nto the formation of the polaron state of an electron, in which the electron\nis wrapped by the cloud of the optical phonons. The depth of the effective electronic polaron potential hole in the crystal of GaAs may be about\n2.5 meV [19]. In this case the spread of the polaron cloud may be estimated\nas several tens of nanometers. When the density of the quantum dots in\nthe sample is large enough, so that the inter-dot separation is comparable to the size of the polaron, the existence of the polaron states may be\nnot well established. In an overall agreement with the current experiments\n[4, 14] we shall assume the density of the quantum dots in the sample to\nbe 8\u00d71021 m\u22123 . Realizing that the polaronic spectral density peak would\nbe only about several meV below the low-energy edge of the wetting-layer\nstates in GaAs, and having in mind the intention to study a mechanism\nleading to the appearance of a broad continuous spectral density in the\nbroad range of energy from about E = \u2212ELO until the wetting-layer edge\nE = 0, we shall leave the question of the polaron effect of the carriers in\nthe WL states open and give our attention to that term in the equation (5),\nwhich is at T = 0 proportional to the electronic population of the wetting\nlayer Nk .\nThat term of the self-energy of the wetting-layer state k, which is proportional to the wetting-layer population, will be in the lowest order approximation:\nMk (E) =\n\nX\n\n\u03b1k,k\u2032\n\nk\u2032\n\nNk \u2032\n.\nE \u2212 Ek\u2032 + ELO + i\u2206\n\n(18)\n\nNk \u2032\np\n.\n2\n\u2212 k | E + ELO \u2212 Ek\u2032 + i\u2206\n\n(19)\n\nSubstituting for \u03b1k,k\u2032 we get\n1\nMk (E) =\n(2\u03c0)3\n\nZZZ\n\nd3 k\u2032\n\n|\n\nk\u2032\n\n\f13\n\nSpectral density (1/meV)\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\u221240\n\n\u221230\n\n\u221220\n\u221210\nEnergy (meV)\n\n0\n\nFigure 3. The full and the dash-dot lines give, respectively, the spectral densities of the\nphonon satellite of the wetting-layer states \u03c3tot (E), related to a single quantum dot, and\nthe spectral density \u03c3n (E) of the discrete state of a single dot, both computed for the\nwetting-layer population Nk = 0.75. The dashed line is the spectral density of the phonon\nsattelite of the WL states \u03c3tot (E) computed for the WL states population Nk = 0.5.\n\nThe integration is extended over the range of k < km . Changing the integration variable from k\u2032 to w = k\u2032 \u2212 k, we get\nMk (E) =\n\n1\n(2\u03c0)3\n\nZZZ\n\nd3 w\n\nNw+k\np\n.\n2\n| w | E + ELO \u2212 Ew+k + i\u2206\n\n(20)\n\nWhen going to the spherical coordinates, the factor | w |2 in the denominator cancels with the factor coming from the Jacobian of the transformation.\nIn the rest of the integrand we shall make the approximation of \"forward\nscattering\", which will consist in neglecting the scattering vector w in Nw+k\nand in Ew+k . The integration limits obviously must obey simultaneously\nthe complicated condition of | k |< km and | w + k |< km . We shall substitute this condition by the condition | w |< km which is obviously exact\nin the limit of k = 0. The preliminary detailed numerical evaluation of\nthe integral shows, that the simplified evaluation of the integral in (20) is\nplausible.\nThe above introduced approximations allow for obtaining the following\nsimple approximate analytical form of the self-energy, namely,\n\u03b3\n,\n(21)\nMk (E) =\nE + ELO \u2212 Ek + i\u2206\n\n\f14\nin which \u03b3 = pkm Nk /(2\u03c0 2 ). The distribution of the electrons in all the\nwetting-layer states k is constant and equal to Nk .\nThe Green's function of the state k in the wetting layer then is:\nGk (E) =\n\n1\nE \u2212 Ek \u2212\n\n\u03b3\nE+ELO \u2212Ek +i\u2206\n\n+ i\u2206\n\n.\n\n(22)\n\nLooking for the approximate single pole behaviour of this Green's function in the region of energy E \u2248 ELO , we find the following approximate\nexpression of the wetting-layer electron Green's function:\nGk (E) =\n\n2\n\u03b3/ELO\n.\nE + ELO \u2212 Ek + i\u2206\n\n(23)\n\nSumming up all the satellite spectral densities of the individual WL states\nk within the range of k < km gives the total spectral density \u03c3tot (E) of all\nthe extended states. The total spectral density of the phonon satellite of\nthe WL states, related to a single quantum dot, is displayed in the Fig. 3 for\nthe values 0.5 and 0.75 of the population Nk . In the same graph the single\ndot bound state spectral density for Nk = 0.75 is displayed for the purpose\nof comparing the spectral density of the single dot bound state spectral line\nwith the spectral density of the phonon satellite per one quantum dot.\nThe total spectral density of the WL satellite, \u03c3tot (E), is proportional to\nthe first power of the WL population Nk , while the integral of the discrete\nstate \u03c3n (E) is constant and equal one. Therefore, increasing the WL population leads to a relative weakening of the discrete state spectral density\nwith respect to the \u03c3tot (E). A similar trend is observed in the experimental\npaper [14], in which the discrete peaks in the sub-wetting layer region of\nthe spectra appear to weaken with respect to the continuous background\nsignal, when the WL population increases.\nIn the present model of the SAQD sample, the set of the WL states\nincluded in the theory is identical with the set of states which are populated\nwith nonzero Nk . Only these states contribute then to the formation of the\nphonon satellite of the WL states. This may lead us to expect, that the\nexperimental spectra of the sub-WL optical response might be influenced\nalso by the distribution function of the population of the WL states.\nIn the present approach the WL satellite continuum is found in the interval of energy (\u2212ELO , 0), while in the experiment the continuous background\nmay be observed even at the lower energy side of this energy interval. We\nexpect that our model may give the extended range of the continuum upon\ngoing to higher orders in the iterative solution of the equations (4,5).\n2 gives the\nThe numerical estimate of the dimensionless quantity \u03b3/ELO\n\u22122\nvalue of about 2.8\u00d710 . The spectral density of the wetting layer satellite\n\n\f15\nshould thus be about 36 times smaller than that of the WL spectral density\nitself. This number is not easy to compare with the available experimental\ndata, see e. g. [33], because, e. g., we have to be aware of the fact that the\noptical spectra may be not simply proportional to the spectral densities\nand also, because our model, assuming the three dimensional wetting layer,\nmay not allow for such a direct comparison of these spectral densities.\n5. Conclusions\nThe present numerical estimate shows that the Fr\u00f6hlich's mechanism of\nthe electron-phonon coupling in the self-assembled quantum dot samples\ncan contribute considerably to the spectral features observed in the PLE\nexperiments, providing that the population of the electrons in the wettinglayer states is sufficiently large. The optical signal in the sub-wetting layer\nregion of the excitation energy can be expected to have a twofold origin.\nFirst, the energy levels of the bound states are broadened by the coupling\nto the populated WL states. Second, there is a continuous background in\nthe sub-WL region, which is ascribed to the low-energy phonon sattelite of\nthe wetting-layer states and which intensity increases linearly with the WL\npopulation.\nThe present conclusions, saying that the electron-LO-phonon coupling\ncan provide the explanation of the continuous features in the optical spectra, do not mean an exclusion of other contributions, like the direct carriercarrier coupling. These effects remain to be considered in detail, together\nwith the influence of the polaron states and the dimensionality of the WL\nstates.\nAcknowledgements\nThe work was supported by the grants IAA1010113, OCP5.20, RN19982003014\nand by the project AVOZ1-010-914.\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n\n3.\n\nYoffe, A.
