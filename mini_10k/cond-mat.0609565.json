Many practical applications of these new compounds were envisioned, and at the same time an intense debate arose regarding\nthe origin and possible mechanisms leading to this new phenomenon. Enz recorded the often confusing\ndiscussions of the early days of high-Tc research in his beautiful textbook.[2] One of the most influential\ncontributions to the theory of these materials was provided by Anderson's \"dogmas\".[3] He stated that the\ncuprate high-Tc phase diagram arises from an inherent competition between a Mott insulator phase and\ns-wave BCS superconductivity in these materials. In order to model high-Tc superconductivity, he proposed a two-dimensional one-band Hubbard model in combination with a resonant valence bond (RVB)\nwave function. A great portion of the theoretical community in the field has since embraced these dogmas. However, unfortunately we still remain without a clear vision as to where these dogmas are leading\nus.[4] Around 1990, Scalapino and others[5] pointed out that a perturbative analysis of the 2D Hubbard\nmodel in the weak-coupling limit produces d-wave superconductivity. Indeed, a d-wave superconducting\norder parameter was experimentally established around 1994 for single crystal samples of optimally doped\nBi2212, YBCO and LSCO, using powerful angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)[6] and\nelegant Josephson interferometry[7, 8]. These observations motivated us to investigate d-wave superconductivity within the BCS framework.[9, 10, 11]\nBefore elaborating further, let us first examine the generic phase diagram of the hole doped high-Tc\ncuprate superconductors shown in Fig. 1. From the beginning, this phase diagram has been hotly debated.\nAround the year 2000, a few groups suggested that the pseudogap region can be described by a d-wave\ndensity wave (dDW) phase. Indeed, the giant Nernst effect observed in the underdoped Bi2212, YBCO and\nLSCO[17, 18, 19] and the angle dependent magnetoresistance in Y0.68 Pr0.32 CuO4 [20] have been found\nto be fully consistent with dDW.[21, 22] In past work, we have shown that these are consequences of the\nLandau quantization of the quasiparticle spectrum in a magnetic field, analogous to earlier considerations\npss data will be provided by the publisher\n\n\f2\n\nH.

PG is the pseudogap\nregion.\n\nby Nersesyan et al. [23, 24] Moreover, we note that the Fermi arcs (or pockets) in the (\u03c0, \u03c0) directions,\nobserved by ARPES, follow directly from dDW. [16, 25, 26] Furthermore, it is by now well established\nthat the overdoped regions of the cuprates can also be described in terms of a d-wave BCS model. [11, 15]\nRecently, Laughlin[27] pointed out that the Gutzwiller operator which is commonly used in the RVB\nwave function is not mathematically tractable, and proposed to replace it by a less constrained Jastrow\noperator. He named the resulting coexistence phase \"gossamer superconductivity\", i.e. a condensate with\na reduced superfluid density and reduced density of states near the Fermi surface. Such a reduction of the\nquasiparticle density of states has recently been observed by Tallon et al[28, 29] by means of a thermodynamic analysis and the effect of Zn impurities in YBCO over a wide doping range. In section 4 we will\nreturn to the characterization of gossamer superconductivity. Note also that gossamer superconductivity\nemerges naturally from the phase diagram in Fig. 1 as a coexistent phase of d-wave superconductivity\nin the presence of a d-wave density wave.[14, 15, 16] In the following we will explore this gossamer\nsuperconductivity phenomenon in detail.\n\n2 Effective Hamiltonian\nIn this section, we construct an effective low-energy Hamiltonian that constitutes the basis of the bottomup approach. This approach should be viewed as an alternative to the common top-down approaches\noriginating from higher-energy Hamiltonians, such as the t-J and Hubbard models. Considering the energy\nscales of these models, e.g. typically a Hubbard U of the order of 106 K, it turns out to be a rather difficult\ntask to arrive at superconducting phenomena that exist at scales of Tc\u223c 103 K. Based on the renormalization\ngroup analysis of 2D electron systems[30] we understand that the normal state is a Fermi liquid, i.e. not\na Luttinger liquid or bosonic liquid. Here we define the Fermi liquid via a quasiparticle Green function\nwhich has simple poles, a definition that is consistent with Shankar[30] and Landau[31]. Furthermore, we\nknow that at sufficiently low temperatures the normal state becomes unstable against infrared divergences\nin the 2-particle and/or 2-hole channels, implying superconductivity, or unstable against divergences in the\nparticle-hole channel, implying density wave phases.\nc 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Two self-consistent gap equations follow directly from this\nHamiltonian:\ng1 X\nk, \u03c3f (k)hc\u2020k+Q,\u03c3 ck,\u03c3 i,\n(2)\n\u2206\u22171 =\nhf 2 (k)i\nX\ng2\n\u2206\u22172 =\nk, \u03c3f (k)hc\u2020k,\u2191 c\u2020\u2212k,\u2193 i.\n(3)\nhf 2 (k)i\n\nHere \u22061 and \u22062 are the order parameters of dDW and dSC respectively. In the following, we use\nf (k) = cos(2\u03c6) as the angular dependence. A similar Hamiltonian has been considered in related work by\nThalmeier.[32] However this study was limited to conventional DW and conventional SC, and to the case\nof vanishing chemical potential \u03bc. As we shall see here, \u03bc is an important control parameter in the present\nmodel.[16] Moreover, when both DW and SC are conventional, there is little room for their coexistence; instead phase separation is the rule. [32] On the other hand, when both order parameters are unconventional,\nthere is ample opportunity for their coexistence.[33] This fact will be exploited in the following.\nThe Nambu-Gorkov Green function[34] of this model is given by\nG\u22121 (k, \u03c9n ) = i\u03c9n \u2212 \u01ebk \u03c13 \u03c33 + \u03bc\u03c33 + |\u22061 | exp(\u2212i\u03c61 \u03c13 )f (k)\u03c11 \u03c33 + |\u22062 | exp(\u2212i\u03c62 \u03c33 )f (k)\u03c31 , (4)\nand the corresponding spinor field is\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03a8k = c\u2020k,\u03c3 , c\u2212k,\u2212\u03c3 , c\u2020k+Q,\u03c3 , c\u2212k\u2212Q,\u2212\u03c3 .\n\n(5)\n\nOne notes that unlike in Ref. [14], the present G\u22121 (k, \u03c9n ) possesses two Abelian gauge transformations\nassociated with \u03c61 (sliding motion of dDW) and \u03c62 (supercurrent in dSC). The determinant of G\u22121 (k, \u03c9n )\nis given by\n\u0001\n\u00012\nD = det|G\u22121 (k, \u03c9n )| = \u03c9n2 + \u01eb2k + \u03bc2 + |\u22061 (k)|2 + |\u22062 (k)|2 \u2212 4\u03bc2 \u01eb2k + |\u22061 (k)|2 . (6)\n\nUsing this result, the quasiparticle energy is found to be\ns\n\u00132\n\u0012q\n\u01eb2k + |\u22061 (k)|2 \u2213 \u03bc + |\u22062 (k)|2 ,\nE=\u00b1\n\n(7)\n\nwhich agrees with earlier results.[12, 30] Finally, the quasiparticle density of states is given by\nN (E)\n=\nN0\n\n*\n\nE\n\nRe r\u0010\n\u00112\np\n\u01eb2k \u2212 \u220622 f (k)2 \u2213 \u03bc \u2212 \u220621 f (k)2\n\n\u03bc\n\n1\u2213 p\nE 2 \u2212 \u220622 f (k)2\n\n!+\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere + and - stand for the positive-energy and negative-energy solutions respectively.\nIn Fig. 2 the quasiparticle density of states is shown for a particular set of parameters. For these\nparameters, we observe clear dips in the vicinity of E=0 , as well as a quasi-linear dependence on energy.\nIn the regime \u22061 \u2212 \u03bc < \u22062 one of the peaks splits into two peaks. Although such a split peak has not yet\nbeen observed experimentally, except in the presence of Ni impurities,[35] the present result is consistent\nwith recent measurements on underdoped Bi2212.[36] Moreoever, this result is rather different from earlier\nwork by Zeyher and Greco [37] who assumed \u03bc = 0.\nc 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Finally, the dDW regime terminates\nwhen \u03bc/\u220610 = 0.824. We call these periodic dDW phases dDWII and dDWIII respectively.\n\n4 Gossamer Superconductivity\nNow we can ask how dSC appears on top of this dDW background. In the following, we shall limit\nourselves to the region \u22061 \u226b \u22062 , \u03bc. Then we can deduce in the vicinity of the superconducting transition\ntemperature, Tc2 , the quasiparticle density of states at the Fermi surface which is given by\ng(\u03bc, 0) = hg(0, k)i =\n\n2\nxK(x),\n\u03c0\n\n(13)\n\nwith x = \u03bc/\u22061 (\u03bc) and K(z) is the complete elliptic function of the first kind. g(\u03bc, 0) resembles the\nquasiparticle density of states deduced from the analysis of Zn-impurities[28]. The corresponding lowtemperature entropy is given by[29]\n27\u03b6(3)\nT\nS\n=\n\u03b3N g(\u03bc)\n,\nT\n2\u03c0 2\n\u22062 (\u03bc)\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03b3N = \u03c0 2 N0 /3. On the other hand, the superconducting transition temperature and free energy are\ncontrolled by\ng1 (\u03bc, 0) = 2hcos2 (2\u03c6)g(0, k)i =\n\n4x\n(K(x) \u2212 E(x)),\n\u03c0\n\n(15)\n\nas\nTc (\u03bc)\nU0\n\n\u22121 \u22121\n= 1.136\u22061 (\u03bc) exp[\u2212(\u03bb\u22121\n(\u03bc, 0)],\n1 \u2212 \u03bb2 )g\n1\n= \u2212 N0 g1 (\u03bc)[\u22062 (\u03bc, 0)]2 .\n4\n\n(16)\n(17)\nc 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

(16) appears to somewhat overestimate Tc (\u03bc), and hence a more detailed treatment needs to be developed in order to be more realistic. The functions \u22061 (\u03bc)/\u220610 , g(\u03bc, 0) and g1 (\u03bc, 0) are shown in Fig. 4. The\ndependence of the functions g(\u03bc, 0) and g1 (\u03bc, 0) on \u03bc/\u220610 is in agreement with available experimental\ndata.[28, 29]\n\n1.2\n1.0\n\n\u22061(\u03bc)/\u220610\ng(\u03bc)\ng1(\u03bc)\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u03bc/\u220610\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nFig. 4 Functions \u22061 (\u03bc)/\u220610 , g(\u03bc, 0) and g1 (\u03bc, 0), controlling the low-doping region of the high-Tc superconductors.\n\nBy solving the coupled gap equations in the regime \u22062 , \u03bc \u226a \u22061 we find[16]\n\u03c1s (0) =\nTc2\n\n=\n\n\u03bb\u22122 (\u03bc, 0) =\n\n\u220622 (\u03bc, 0)\n,\n\u22062 (0)\n1 \u220622 (\u03bc, 0)\n,\n2 ln 2 \u22062 (0)\n4\u03c0e2\np\u03c1s (0).\nm\u2217\n\n\u2243\n\n(18)\n(19)\n(20)\n\nThese are essentially the Uemura relations.[45] Therefore, if we limit ourselves to the deeply underdoped\nregion, many experimentally observed features of gossamer superconductivity follow naturally from the\npresent model.\n\n5 Concluding Remarks\nThe model treated here is based on an effective low-energy Hamiltonian which describes dDW and dSC\nstates with the chemical potential as a control parameter. This theory accounts for the following principle\nfeatures of high-temperature cuprate superconductors: (a) the normal state is a Fermi liquid, (b) the pseudogap phase is a dDW (more recently a d-wave spin density wave has also been suggested[46, 47]), (c) the\nsuperconductivity in the optimal to overdoped regime has a BCS d-wave order parameter, and (d) in the\nunderdoped regime there is gossamer superconductivity, i.e. dSC coexisting with dDW.\nRecent related studies on heavy fermion compounds, such as CeCoIn5 under pressure[48], and organic\nconductors, such as \u03b2\"-(BEDT-TTF)4 [N3 O)M(C2 O4 ]C5 H5 N with M = Ga and Cr [49, 50], have revealed\nc 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n\n\fpss header will be provided by the publisher\n\n7\n\nmany parallels between the high-Tc cuprates and these systems. These include (a) a layered structure or\nquasi-two-dimensionality, (b) d-wave superconductivity[51, 52], and (c) d-wave density wave phases[47,\n53, 54]. In the heavy fermion and organic conductors the horizontal axis in Fig. 3 needs to be replaced by\nthe external pressure P, but otherwise their phase diagrams look very similar. This suggest strongly that the\npresent model is rather universal and applies to many strongly correlated electron systems.\nLet us finally note that gossamer superconductivity is not necessarily restricted to dSC and dDW. For\nexample, recent experiments on the Bechgaard salts (TMTSF)2 PF6 at ambient pressure[55, 56, 57] and\nmeasurements of the angle dependent magnetothermal conductivity in URu2 Si2 [58] suggest that there are\nother kinds of gossamer superconductivity, e.g. f-wave superconductivity coexisting with a d-wave spin\ndensity wave. Hence it will not be surprising if similar coexistence states will soon be discovered in related\nstrongly correlated electron systems.\nAcknowledgements We are grateful for inspiring and stimulating discussions with Dionys Baeriswyl, Christian\nBernhard, Amalia Coldea, Balasz Dora, Jeff Tallon, Peter Thalmeier, Andras Vanyolos and Attila Virosztek.
