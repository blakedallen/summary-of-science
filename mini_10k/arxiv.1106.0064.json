Introduction\nThe existence of tiny neutrino masses is probably the first signal of physics beyond the\nStandard Model (SM). One can envision various possibilities for such new physics, but\nthe simplest is probably the addition of extra singlet fermions, that can play the role\nof the missing helicity partners of the SM neutrinos. Such models include very different\npossibilities ranging from Dirac neutrinos to the popular Type-I seesaw models [1, 2, 3, 4].\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fThe particle content is the same in both cases, but the couplings of the extra especies to\nthe SM fields and among themselves are different.\nIn the case of seesaw models, the most general couplings are assumed, in particular\nthose that break lepton number, such as Majorana masses for the singlet fermions. In order\nto recover naturally light neutrinos, those masses are assumed to be very large, above the\nelectroweak scale. There is however no reason why this scale should be so high, and\nseveral works have considered the phenomenological implications of a much lower seesaw\nscale [5, 6, 7, 8]. Dirac neutrinos can be recovered by imposing a global lepton number\nsymmetry. Such a lepton number symmetry can however be implemented in more than one\nway, since there is freedom in the lepton number charge assignments of the extra sterile\nspecies. Different choices of these charges led to different models besides Dirac neutrinos,\nsuch as the inverse seesaw [9, 10].\nThe purpose of this paper is a first step towards a systematic exploration of the phenomenology of such models, in increasing order of complexity, in order to quantify the\nconstraints imposed by data. The theoretical prejudice will be just the number of extra\nWeyl fermions, nR . We consider therefore the more general couplings, i.e. without imposing lepton number symmetries, although obviously the models with exact symmetries\ncan be recovered in appropriate limits. In this work we will consider just the simplest\npossibilities nR = 1, 2 and leave other cases for future investigations.\nThe simplest choice, which corresponds to adding just one additional singlet Weyl\nfermion, nR = 1, has in principle enough free parameters to fit the solar and atmospheric\noscillation data. A more detailed analysis however shows that it does not work, just\nconsidering long-baseline oscillation neutrino data. The next-to-minimal choice requires\ntwo Weyl fermions, nR = 2. Such a possibility is of course well known to be a viable\none (as long as the LSND/MinBoone signal is discarded), both in the Dirac limit and\nin the standard seesaw limit. In both cases, the physics spectrum contains one massless\nneutrino and two massive ones and, therefore, the two required splittings. The main goal\nof the paper will be the exploration of the parameter space in between these two limits, to\nsearch for other viable solutions that could accommodate at least the solar and atmospheric\noscillation. In order to analyse this model we discuss a convenient parametrization valid\nfor nR \u2264 3. In the mini-seesaw region, the Casas-Ibarra parametrization [11] is used to\nderive approximate oscilllation probabilities, accurate in this regime.\nMany works before have been devoted to study the implications of neutrino oscillation\ndata on models with extra sterile neutrinos (some recent analyses are [12, 13, 14, 15]),\nusually refered to as 3 + 1, 3 + 2, ...3 + Ns . Most of these studies have been done with\nthe motivation of trying to accommodate LSND [16], and MiniBooNe data [17, 18]. It is\nimportant to stress that these phenomenological models usually correspond to a generic\nmodel with 3+Ns mass eigenstates. The number of free parameters for Ns = nR is typically\nmuch larger than what we find, either because the number of Weyl fermions involved is\ndifferent (e.g. 3 + 1 Dirac fermions correspond in our context to nR = 5 and not to nR = 1)\nor because couplings that are forbidden by gauge invariance in our model, such as Majorana\nmass entries for the active neutrinos, are included effectively in the phenomenological\nmodels. It is obvious that our models for any nR will be contained as restricted cases in\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fthese phenomenological models for Ns = nR . However, the analyses performed in these\nworks do not take such limits and usually restrict the number of parameters by assuming\ninstead some hierarchies between neutrino masses that could accommodate LSND.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. We start by setting up the notation in sec. 2\nand the parametrization in sec. 3. In sec. 4 we consider the implication of oscillation\nexperiments on the 3+1 model. In sec. 5 we consider the 3+2 model in the degenerate\nlimit in the context of LBL, solar and atmospheric oscillations. In sec. 6 we discuss the\nimplications for LSND/MiniBoone, as well as for tritium and neutrinoless double beta\ndecay experiments. In sec. 7 we briefly consider the non-degenerate case in the miniseesaw regime. The very stringent bound on the quasi-Dirac region implied by solar data\nis discussed in detail in sec. 8.\n\n2. Models with extra singlet fermions\nThe leptonic part of the Standard Model Lagrangian is:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\n3\n3 \uf8f2\n\uf8fd\nX\nX\n \u0304l\u03b1 \u03b3 \u03bc D\u03bc l\u03b1 + \u0113\u03b1 \u03b3 \u03bc D\u03bc e\u03b1 \u2212\n \u0304l\u03b1 Y \u03b1\u03b2 \u03a6e\u03b2 + h.c.,\nLSM =\nL\nR\nR\nL e\nR\n\uf8f3L\n\uf8fe\n\u03b1=1\n\n(2.1)\n\n\u03b2=1\n\nwhere l\u03b1 is the lepton doublet. To simplify notation, from now on summation over repeated\nindices is understood.\nWe study the minimal extension of the Standard Model that can account for neutrino\nmasses, i.e. the inclusion of nR gauge singlet Weyl fermions (hereafter called \"right-handed\nneutrinos\", \u03bdR ):\n\u03b2\n\u03b1 \u03b1\u03b2\nL = LSM \u2212  \u0304lL\nY\u03bd \u03a6\u0303\u03bdR\n+ h.c.\n(2.2)\nIf lepton number is violated, gauge-invariant Majorana mass terms can be added to the\nminimal Lagrangian:\n1 \u03b1c \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b1 \u03b1\u03b2\n\u2212 \u03bd\u0304R\nL = LSM \u2212  \u0304lL\nY\u03bd \u03a6\u0303\u03bdR\nMN \u03bdR + h.c.\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\nThe new mass parameters in the matrix MN\nare unbounded. If they are very large\ncompared to the electro-weak symmetry breaking scale, v, the right-handed neutrinos decouple from the light spectrum. They can be integrated out giving mass to the light\nneutrinos through the effective dimension-5 operator [19],\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b2\n\u22121 T \u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b1\nO5 =  \u0304lL\nY\u03bd\nY\u03bd MN\n\u03a6\u0303 \u03a6 lL\n.\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhich induces, upon spontaneous symmetry breaking, a Majorana mass to the SM neutrinos of the form\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u22121 T\nY\u03bd .\nm\u03bd = v 2 Y\u03bd MN\n(2.5)\nThis is the famous seesaw mechanism [1, 2, 3, 4], that can lead to small neutrino masses,\neven if their Yukawa couplings are of O(1), provided there is a large hierarchy between v\nand MN .\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fIf the Yukawa coupling of \u03bdL and \u03bdR fermions with the Higgs field are, however, of the\nsize of the electron Yukawa coupling or smaller, MN = O(1) TeV or less and new interesting\nsignatures are possible. If MN = O(100) GeV, direct production of right-handed neutrinos\nthrough Higgs decay can take place at the LHC [20, 21, 22, 23]. For MN \u2208 [0.1, 10] GeV,\nright-handed Majorana neutrinos induce lepton-violating processes in meson decays (for a\nrecent study see [24]). In the keV range right-handed neutrinos can be interesting dark\nmatter candidates (for a recent revival see [25, 26]) or in the eV range, they could contribute\nto explain the LSND-MiniBooNE anomaly [12, 14] and affect cosmological observables, such\nas the abundance of light elements, the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background\nor the large scale structure (for recent analyses see [27, 28, 29]).\nIn this paper we concentrate only on the constraints imposed by oscillation data which\ncan be relevant for MN not much larger than a few eV.\n2.1 Physical parameters\nThe number of physical parameters can be determined in different ways. In the following\nwe use the method proposed in [30]. If R/I is the number of real/imaginary parameters in\nthe generic Yukawa matrices, Rs /I s is the number of real/imaginary parameters defining\nthe symmetry group elements of the lepton sector when the Yukawa matrices are switched\noff, and Rr /I r is the number of parameters describing the group elements that survive\nfor non-zero Yukawa matrices, the number of real/imaginary physical parameters should\nsatisfy the following relation:\nRphys = R \u2212 (Rs \u2212 Rr ),\nIphys = I \u2212 (I s \u2212 I r ).\n\n(2.6)\n\nWe have two separate equations for the real and imaginary parameters: the first ones\nbecome either masses or angles and the latter become phases.\nLet us do the counting in general for nL families of active and nR families of steriles.\nThe charged lepton Yukawa matrix is nL \u00d7 nL , while the charged-neutral one is rectangular\nnL \u00d7nR . The mass matrix of the Majorana neutrinos is a symmetric square matrix nR \u00d7nR .\nThe total number of real and imaginary parameters is, therefore:\nR = I = nL (nL + nR ) + nR\n\n(nR + 1)\n.\n2\n\n(2.7)\n\nIf all those matrices would vanish, the symmetry group of the lepton sector would be\nU (nL ) for the left doublets, U (nR ) for the Majorana neutrinos and U (nL ) for the righthanded charged fermions. Therefore the number of real and imaginary parameters of the\ncorresponding group elements is:\nnR (nR \u2212 1)\n,\n2\nnR (nR + 1)\nI s = nL (nL + 1) +\n.\n2\n\nRs = nL (nL \u2212 1) +\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n(2.8)\n\n\fThere is no remaining symmetry when the masses are non-zero Rr , I r = 0, and therefore\nthe number of physical parameters is:\nRphys = nL (nR + 1) + nR = nL nR + nR + nL ,\nIphys = nL (nR \u2212 1).\n\n(2.9)\n\nSince the number of zero modes in the mass matrix is generically nL \u2212 nR , the number\nof mass parameters is nL + nR + nR = nL + 2nR for nL \u2265 nR (which should be real\nparameters). Therefore:\nNangles = nR (nL \u2212 1) nL \u2265 nR\n\nNphases = nL (nR \u2212 1).\n\n(2.10)\n\nIt is important to stress here again the difference between the model we are considering\nand the phenomenological 3 + Ns models. For example the popular 3 + 1 model has six\nphysical angles and four mass eigenstates. In order to have that number of physical angles\nin our case we need to have at least nR = 3, but that choice would generically imply six\nmass eigenstates. In order to recover only four we would need to have some degeneracies,\nthat is, some Weyl fermions must pair up into Dirac neutrinos, which typically reduces also\nthe number of physical angles. For example, we could get the 3 + 1 model from nR = 5 and\nimposing a global lepton number symmetry (there are probably other choices to obtain the\nsame result).\nA more systematic way to constrain models with singlet fermions is to classify them in\nincreasing order of complexity, according to the number of extra fermionic field degrees of\nfreedom and the global symmetries, in contrast with the classification based on the physical\nspectrum that might represent different choices of the former type. In this work we will\nconcentrate on the two simplest cases: nR = 1 and 2. The number of physical parameters\nand the generic spectrum for the different choices of global symmetries are summarized in\nTable 2.1.\nIn the absence of global lepton number symmetries, the case nR = 1 gives a spectrum\nof two massive and two massless fermions. There are two physical angles and no CP\nviolation. If a lepton number symmetry is imposed, there is only one charge assignment\nfor the extra field that allows a renormalizable coupling to the SM neutrino fields (L = 1)\n1 . In this case, the two massive Majorana fermions are degenerate and form a massive\nDirac fermion, while two Weyl fermions remain massless. Clearly the model with nR = 1\nwith a global lepton number symmetry is ruled out, as it cannot accommodate the solar\nand atmospheric oscillations. On the other hand the model without the global symmetry\ncontains in principle sufficient parameters (two mass eigenstates and two angles) to explain\nboth oscillations lengths.\nThe model with nR = 2 and no lepton number symmetries, gives rise to a spectrum\nincluding four massive and one massless neutrino. There are also four physical angles and\nthree CP violating phases.\n1\n\nAny charge assignment that forbids couplings of the singlet fermions to the SM fields is of course\nuninteresting.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fnR\n1\n2\n\n3\n\nLi\n+1\n(+1,+1)\n(+1,-1)\n(+1,+1,+1)\n(+1,-1,+1)\n(+1,-1,-1)\n\n# zero modes\n2\n2\n1\n1\n3\n0\n0\n2\n4\n\n# masses\n2\n1\n4\n2\n1\n6\n3\n2\n1\n\n# angles\n2\n2\n4\n3\n3\n6\n3\n6\n4\n\n# CP phases\n0\n0\n3\n1\n1\n6\n1\n4\n1\n\nTable 1: Spectrum and number of independent angles and phases for the models with nR = 1, 2\nwithout and with global lepton number symmetries. The second column shows the lepton number,\nL, charge assignments of the extra singlets., Li Only charge assignments were none of the extra\nsinglets gets completely decoupled are considered.\n\nSimplifications also occur when lepton number symmetries are imposed. For nR = 2\nthere are two choices for the lepton number charge assignments that allow renormalizable\ncouplings between the extra singlet fermions and the SM neutrinos. One obvious choice\nis to give both of the sterile fields lepton number charge +1. In this case, the spectrum\ndegenerates into a massless neutrino and two massive Dirac neutrinos. The number of\nphysical angles gets reduced to three and there is only one physical CP phase. Obviously\nthis choice is as good as the standard three-neutrino mixing model to accommodate existing\noscillation data.\nThe other choice for the charge assignments is to give charge +1 only to one of the extra\nfields and -1 to the other. In this case, the spectrum consist of three massless neutrinos and\none massive Dirac one. The number of physical angles is reduced to two and there is no\nCP violation. This model with just one mass cannot explain oscillation data. However, a\nsmall perturbation that breaks the lepton number symmetry is again as rich as the generic\ncase of nR = 2, but with some strong hierarchies, naturally preserved by the approximate\nlepton number symmetry. This is the minimal flavour violating seesaw model considered\nin [31] (see also [32]). For nR = 3, there are many more possibilities, listed in Table 2.1.\n\n3. Parametrization\nConsider the generic mass matrix corresponding to the model with three left-handed neutrinos and nR right-handed Majorana neutrinos:\n!\n0 Y\u03bd \u221av2\n(3.1)\nM\u03bd =\nY\u03bdT \u221av2 MN\nwhere MN is a nR \u00d7 nR matrix and Y\u03bd is a 3 \u00d7 nR matrix. On the other hand, without\nloss of generality, the MN matrix can be chosen as a diagonal matrix.

This procedure can\nbe easily extended to the case nR = 3, in which case W would depend on three angles.\nNote that the number of real free parameters of M\u2032\u03bd in the new basis (the angles\nincluded in the matrices U and W and the mass parameters in m and MN ) complete\nthe expected total number and provide therefore a complete parametrization. For the CP\nphases, it can be shown that one of them can be absorbed in a \u03b4-type phase in U , and 2/5\nadditional phases can be absorbed in W for nR = 2/3 respectively. The latter disappear\nin the Dirac case, MN = 0.\nWe have not yet brought the full matrix to a diagonal form, but the necessary additional\nrotation angles must be calculable in terms of the elements of M\u2032\u03bd . We first note that the\nDirac case, MN = 0, is trivial for any nR , because the final diagonalization is just a trivial\nrotation of angle \u03c0/4 (i.e. Majorana to Dirac basis) in the subsectors 34 for nR = 1, in the\nsectors 34 and 25 for nR = 2 and 34, 25, 16 for nR \u2265 3.\nLet us consider the diagonalization in the remaining cases.\n3.1 3+1 Model\nFor the simplest case nR = 1, the final diagonalization requires a 2\u00d72 rotation on the 34\nsubspace:\nM\u03bd \u2032\u2032 = \u03a9\u2032T M\u03bd \u2032 \u03a9\u2032 = diag(0, 0, \u03bb\u2212 , \u03bb+ ),\n(3.7)\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fwhere\n\u03bb\u2212 \u2261\nand\n\uf8eb\n1\n\uf8ec0\n\uf8ec\n\u03a9\u2032 = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed0\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nM\u2212\n\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\nq\n1\nM 2 + 4m2D , \u03bb+ \u2261\nM + M 2 + 4m2D\n2\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f91/2\n\uf8f7\n1\nM\n1\n0\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f7 , sin \u03b834 = \u2212 \uf8f0 \u2212 q\n2 2 M 2 + 4m2\n0 cos \u03b834 sin \u03b834 \uf8f8\nD\n0 \u2212 sin \u03b834 cos \u03b834\n\n(3.8)\n\n(3.9)\n\nThe full diagonalization matrix is therefore \u03a9 \u03a9\u2032 , where the independent parameters are\nchosen to be (mD , M, \u03b813 , \u03b823 ).\nObviously we could also use the completely general phenomenological parametrization\nwith a 4 \u00d7 4 mixing matrix, which relates the mass and flavour eigenstates, Umix .

Notice that here the rotation through the matrix W is unphysical and consequently \u03b845 is not a physical parameter\nin the degenerate case.\nIt is easy to see how the Dirac and seesaw limits are obtained and how the parametrization reduces to the standard one in the three-neutrino mixing scenario. In the Dirac limit,\nthe square neutrino mass matrix is Y\u03bd Y\u03bdT v 2 /2 = U mmT U T = U Diag(0, m2D\u2212 , m2D+ )U T\nand therefore the matrix U is just the PMNS matrix. In the seesaw limit, the same is true,\n\u22121 T 2\nY\u03bd v /2 = M \u22121 U Diag(0, m2D\u2212 , m2D+ )U T for\nsince the light neutrino mass matrix is Y\u03bd MN\nMN = M I.\nThe completely general phenomenological parametrization with a 5 \u00d7 5 mixing matrix,\nwhere the relevant matrix elements will be U\u03b1i , with \u03b1 = e, \u03bc, \u03c4, .. and i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 would\nbe, again,\nUmix = \u03a9 \u03a9\u2032 .\n(3.14)\n3.3 3+2 general case\nThe final diagonalization of M\u2032\u03bd involves solving the eigensystem of a 2nR \u00d7 2nR matrix,\nwhich is not possible analytically in the general case for nR > 1.\nA simplification takes place in the seesaw limit (Y\u03bd v \u226a MN ), but in order for it to be\nsimple it is necessary to first block diagonalize M\u03bd to separate the light and heavy sectors.\nWe can do this by taking the orthogonal rotation\n!\n0 \u03b8\n\u03a9 = exp\n,\n(3.15)\n\u2212\u03b8 \u2020 0\nwhere the mixing \u03b8 is small in the seesaw limit.

In addition, we have the 3 standard angles in \u0168 (\u03b823 , \u03b813 , \u03b812 ) and the extra angle of\nW\u0303 (\u03b845 ). It is important to stress that for the CP conserving case eq. (3.20) is the usual\n\u22121/2\nwhile in the general case, it should be\ngeneric bidiagonalization of the matrix Y\u03bd MN\nunderstood as a definition of the orthogonal matrix W\u0303 . This parametrization turns out\nto be equivalent to that of Casas-Ibarra [11], where the matrix W\u0303 is what they call the\nmatrix R.\nNote that the matrix \u03a9 can now be reconstructed from these parameters since\n\u22121/2\n\n\u03b8 = \u0168 m1/2 W\u0303 T MN\n\n.\n\nThe phenomenological parametrization in this case is\n!\n\u0168\n\u03b8\nUmix = \u03a9 \u03a9\u2032 \u2243\n+ O(\u03b8 2 ),\n\u2212\u03b8 T \u0168 I\n\n(3.22)\n\n(3.23)\n\nand therefore (Umix )\u03b1i = \u03b8\u03b1i for \u03b1 = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 and i = 4, 5.\nObviously this parametrization is not the same as the one discussed before. However,\nnote that in the degenerate case the matrices U and \u0168 coincide. This parametrization\nhas the advantage to be more physical in the seesaw limit, but cannot be extrapolated\nto the quasi-Dirac limit. For a full exploration of the parameter space that works in the\nquasi-Dirac and seesaw limits, the general parametrization of eqs. (3.3) is more appropriate.\n\n4. Constraints from oscillations on 3+1 model\nWe start by considering the 3 + 1 model. Although the model is very constrained, it has in\nprinciple sufficient parameters to fit two mass splittings and two mixing angles. Therefore,\nit is interesting to understand to what extent the model can fit oscillation data.\nWe have explored the full parameter space trying to fit the data from long-baseline\naccelerator (MINOS [33]) and reactor experiments (KAMLAND [34], and CHOOZ[35]),\nsince they provide the most precise information on the oscillation frequencies. We carry\nout the analysis of these experiments as explained in [36, 37], and we refer to those papers\nfor details.\nOn the left plot of Fig. 1, we show the contours \u03c72exp = \u03c72SM + 9.21 on the plane of\nthe two mass parameters (mD , M ) after minimizing in the two angles. \u03c72SM corresponds to\nthe best fit of the standard three-neutrino oscillation scenario, while \u03c72exp corresponds to\nthe minimum in the fits of the nR = 1 model to the experiments (exp): KAMLAND (red),\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fMINOS (green) and CHOOZ (grey). As expected MINOS and KAMLAND allow a very\nconstrained region of parameter space that deviates very little from the lines where one of\nthe mass splittings equals \u2206m2atm and \u2206m2sol respectively. The two lines intersect only in\nthe two points indicated by circles, for the normal (NH) and inverted (IH) hierarchy. On\nthose points, the atmospheric and solar frequencies can be accommodated simultaneously,\nbut the values of the angles that are required to fit the data are nevertheless incompatible,\nas shown on the two right panels.\nThe conclusion is therefore that the 3 + 1 is excluded. Note however that the combination of the three experiments is essential. This is in agreement with the qualitative\nanalysis of ref. [38].\n0\n\n90\n\n10\n\n60\n\n\u03b823\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03bb 2=\n\n\u03bb 2=\n\n\u2206m 2\n\natm\n\n\u2206m 2\n\nsol\n\n75\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n30\n15\n\n2\nm\n\u03bb + = \u2206 atm\n\nNH\n0\n90\n\n2\n\n-2\n\n\u2212\n\u03bb+\n\n2\n\nChooz\n\nM [eV]\n\nNH\n\n10\n\n45\n\n2\n\n\u2206m\n\n2\nm\n\u03bb + = \u2206 sol\n\n2 =\n\u03bb\u2212\n\n75\nat\nm\n\n60\nos\nin\n\n45\n\nM\n\n\u03b823\n\nIH\n\nKamLand\n\n2\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n30\n\u2212\n\u03bb+\n\n2\n\n15\n\n=\n\u03bb\u2212\n\n2\n\nIH\n\nso\nl\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n2\n\n\u2206m\n\n[99% CL]\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\nmD [eV]\n\n0\n\n15\n\n30\n\n45\n\n60\n\n75\n\n90\n\n\u03b813\n\nFigure 1: Left: Contours corresponding to \u03c72exp = \u03c72 |SM\nexp + 9.21 from the fits of the 3+1 model to\nKAMLAND (Red), MINOS (Green) and CHOOZ (grey) on the plane (mD , M ) (after minimizing\nin the angles).

Constraints from oscillations on 3+2 model\nFor the case nR = 2, the number of parameters is quite large to do a full-fledged fit as has\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fbeen done in the 3 + 1 model. We will consider the simpler degenerate limit, where there\nare only three independent masses and three angles and furthermore consider the CP conserving case. In order to identify the allowed regions we will follow the strategy of looking\nfor solutions where at least one of the mass splittings corresponds to the atmospheric one\nand another one to the solar. Given that both splittings are well established by data, this\nmethod should be rather robust in pinning down local minima.\nMore concretely we consider all possible combinations ijkl such that\n\u03bb2i \u2212 \u03bb2j = \u2206m2atm = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 ,\n\n\u03bb2k \u2212 \u03bb2l = \u2206m2sol = 8 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 , i, j, k, l = 0, .., 4\n\n(5.1)\n\nThese two equations imply relations between M , m2D+ and m2D\u2212 that we solve numerically\n\u2212\nfor m+\nD and mD as a function of M . In principle there could be up to 90 combinations,\nbut we restrict to those that correspond to m2D+ > m2D\u2212 , since they have been ordered\nin this way. In the quasi-Dirac limit M \u226a mD+ , mD\u2212 , most combinations are possible,\nwhile in the opposite limit M \u226b mD\u00b1 two states decouple and therefore only the standard\nchoices of the 3\u03bd scenario survive (two for the normal hierarchy and two for the inverse\none). We can therefore classify all the possible solutions by the hierarchy they represent\nin the quasi-Dirac limit. We find the following, qualitatively distinct, spectral patterns\ndepicted in Fig. 2.\n\u2022 Type I: Quasi-Dirac Normal Hierarchy\nFor small M , we could have the solar splitting\nbetween eigenstates 0 and 1 or 0 and\nq\n2\n3, and it is therefore related to mD\u2212 \u223c \u2206msol . The atmospheric splitting could be\np\neither between 0 and the heavier states 2 or 4, ie. mD+ \u223c \u2206m2atm . But it could\nalso be between the states 1/3 and 2/4. There are in total 12 combinations that\ndiffer only by small perturbations of O(\u2206m2sol /\u2206m2atm ). Typically these solutions\nhave other mass splittings that are much smaller than both solar and atmospheric\nfor sufficiently small M . As M increases, most of these solutions disappear except\nthe two that involve only the states 0,1,2.\n\u2022 Type II: Quasi-Dirac Inverse Hierarchy\nThis case is like type I but representing an inverted hierarchy. This happens when\nthe atmospheric mass splitting occurs between states 0 and 1/3 or 2/4, while the\nsolar one does between states 1/3 and 2/4. In this case there\nq are 16 combinations\np\n2\n2\n2\nin total, which have mD\u2212 \u2243 \u2206matm and mD+ \u2212 mD\u2212 \u2243 \u2206m2sol . Again most of\nthese solutions do not survive for large M , only two do. All the additional splittings\nare not larger than those measured.\n\u2022 Type III: Quasi-Dirac Degenerate\nIn this case, the solar splitting is the one between states 1 and 3, while the atmospheric\none is the splitting between states 2 and 4. This solution is only possible for not too\nlarge M and it is rather peculiar because it has other splittings that are larger than\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fType I\n\nType II\n\u039b4\n\nm D+\n\n\u039b4\n\nm D+\n\n\u039b2\n\n\u039b2\n\nDm2atm\n\u039b3\n\nm D-\n\n\u039b1\n\nDm2sol\n\u039b3\n\nm D-\n\n\u039b0\n\n\u039b0\n\nType III\n\nType V\n\u039b4\n\nm D+\n\n\u039b2\n\u039b3\n\nm D-\n\n\u039b1\n\nDm2atm\n\nm D+\n\nDm2sol\n\nm D-\n\n\u039b4\n\nDm2atm\n\n\u039b2\n\u039b3\n\u039b1\n\n\u039b0\n\nDm2sol\n\n\u039b0\n\nType IV-a\n\nm D+\n\nDm2atm\n\n\u039b1\n\nDm2sol\n\nType IV-b\n\u039b4\n\n\u039b4\n\nm D+\n\n\u039b2\n\n\u039b2\n\n2\nDmsol\n\n2\nDmatm\n\nm D-\n\n\u039b3\n\u039b1\n\n\u039b3\n\nm D-\n\n2\nDmsol\n\n\u039b1\n\n\u039b0\n\n2\nDmatm\n\n\u039b0\n\nFigure 2: Spectral structures that contain the solar and atmospheric splitting in the quasi-Dirac\nregion.\n\nthose measured, since typically mD+ , mD\u2212 \u226b\ninteresting if it gives a good fit to the data.\n\np\n\n\u2206m2atm ,\n\nq\n\n\u2206m2sol . It is extremely\n\n\u2022 Type IV: Quasi-Dirac Solar Degenerate\nThis is a mixed situation between the quasi-Dirac and quasi-degenerate cases. There\nare two possibilities. In type IV-a, the solar splitting is the one between states 1 and\n3, while the atmospheric one is driven by mD+ , that is the splitting between states\n0 and 2 or 4 or alternatively 1 or 3 and 2 or 4. There are 6 possibilities of this type.\nType IV-b corresponds to a solar splitting associated to the states 2 and 4. Then the\natmospheric must be related to mD\u2212 , so it is the difference between states 0 and 1\nor 3. Two combinations exist of this type.\n\u2022 Type V: Quasi-Dirac Atmospheric Degenerate\nIn this case, the atmospheric splitting is the one between states 2 and 4, while the\nsolar one is between states 0 and 1 or 3. There are two possible combinations of this\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\ftype, which correspond to a situation with mD\u2212 \u223c\n\nq\n\n\u2206m2sol and mD+ \u226b mD\u2212 .\n\nThere are some more solutions that only occur in the intermediate region of M where no\nclear hierarchies can be established. These however give a very poor fit to the data, so we\nwill not discuss them further.\n5.1 Fits to reactor and accelerator experiments\nWe started by considering the fits to long-baseline reactor and accelerator experiments\n(LBL), that is including Chooz, KamLAND, MINOS appearance and disappearance for\nneutrinos and antineutrinos, that in principle have the most precise information about the\ntwo mass splittings. We find that solutions of all the types mentioned provide a good fit\nto the data, as good as the standard three neutrino scenario. That this holds is obvious in\ntwo limits: the Dirac limit M \u2192 0, where the spectrum matches a three-neutrino mixing\nscenario with one massless neutrino, and, for those solutions that survive, the seesaw limit\nM \u226b mD\u00b1 , where the spectrum also corresponds to a three-neutrino mixing scenario with\none massless neutrino, since the two heavier states decouple. The survival of other solutions\nwith M between the two limits is however non-trivial since they imply the presence of other\nmass splittings that could affect oscillations.\nIn Figs. 3 we show the minimum \u03c72 after minimization in all the angles, as a function\nof M . We only show those solutions that give a good fit for some value of M , which can\nbe classified according to the hierarchies above.\nThe left upper plot corresponds to the solutions of type I . As expected the \u03c72 increases\nsignificantly with respect to the Dirac-limit value for intermediate values of M . From the\npoint of view of LBL data we see that values in the range 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV . M . 1eV give\npoor fits to the data. There are however also some values of M in this range that give\nacceptable fits to the data for some of the solutions, that need further scrutiny.\nA slightly different situation is found for the solutions of type II, which for small/large\nenough M correspond to an inverse hierarchy. Here LBL data can exclude a slightly wider\nregion 10\u22124 eV . M . 1eV and we do not see any local minimum that provides a good fit\nwithin this range.\nThe quasi-degenerate and mixed solutions are shown in the lower plots. In this case\nthe solutions only exist for sufficiently small values of M . 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV, as shown. The plot\non the left corresponds to types III and V, while the one on the right corresponds to types\nIV. The type III gives a rather good fit to the LBL data in all the region, while solutions\nof type V only for M . 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV or for M \u2243 0.005 eV. Some of the solutions of type IV\ninstead give a good fit in most of the range where they exist: 10\u22125 eV . M . 10\u22123 eV.\nIn Figs. 4 we show the minimum \u03c72LBL on the planes defined by each pair of mixing\nangles for the solutions of type I and II as examples. Typically one minimum is found, but\nthere are octant degeneracies, as expected. The solutions can be easily identified by the\nvery different positions of their minima on these planes.\nNote that we consider the same ordering of states in all cases and therefore the solar and atmospheric mass splittings are labelled differently for the different cases. As a\nresult, only in the normal hierarchy cases the values of the angles \u03b812 , \u03b813 and \u03b823 are in\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\f250\n\n250\n\nType I\n\n200\n\nType II\n\n200\n\n\u03a72 LBL\n\n150\n\n\u03a72 LBL\n\n150\n\n100\n\n100\n\n50\n\n50\n\n0\n10-5\n\n0.001\n\n0.1\n\n10\n\n0\n10-5\n\n1000\n\n0.001\n\n0.1\n\nMHeVL\n140\n\n120\n\n10\n\n1000\n\nMHeVL\n250\n\nType III\nType V\n\nType IV\n\n200\n\n\u03a72 LBL\n\n150\n\n\u03a72 LBL\n\n100\n\n80\n\n100\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n1  \u0301 10-5\n\n5  \u0301 10-51  \u0301 10-4\n\n5  \u0301 10-4 0.001\n\n0.005\n\nMHeVL\n\n0\n1  \u0301 10-5\n\n5  \u0301 10-51  \u0301 10-4\n\n5  \u0301 10-4 0.001\n\n0.005\n\nMHeVL\n\nFigure 3: Minimum \u03c72LBL from the fits to KamLAND, MINOS and Chooz as a function of M (eV).\nThe solid(dashed) horizontal line corresponds to \u03c72SM (\u03c72SM + 9) of the standard 3\u03bd scenario.

In the inverse hierarchy case, the angles are quite different, although the\noscillation probabilities in vacuum will be equivalent. For example, the normal hierarchy\nfor the angles (\u03b812 = \u03b8sol , \u03b813 = 0, \u03b823 = \u03b8atm ) is equivalent for the inverse hierarchy to\n(\u03b812 = \u03c0/2, \u03b813 = \u03b8sol , \u03b823 = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8atm ), as can be seen in Figs. 4.\nIn summary, LBL data are able to exclude most solutions in an intermediate region\nof M , but some peculiar solutions do survive. As expected, the quasi-Dirac type I and II\nQD\nsolutions survive for all M \u2264 Mmax\n, and those involving only the lighter 012 states also\nSS\nsurvive in the seesaw limit, M \u2265 Mmin .\nIn the following we will further constrain the intermediate solutions using solar and\natmospheric data, and also refine the determination of the quasi-Dirac and seesaw boundQD\nSS .\naries: Mmax\nand Mmin\n5.2 Solutions for intermediate M\nSolar data give additional constraints on solutions in the intermediate region (we refer to\n[36] for details of the data analysis).

A possible explanation of such anomalies is the existence of extra sterile\nneutrinos in the eV range [13, 8, 14]. It is then an obvious question whether our 3+2 model\nSS can account for any of those anomalies.\nfor M > Mmin\nIn [14] a recent reanalysis of the 3+2 phenomenological scheme shows that there is a\nsignificant improvement in the goodness-of-fit with respect to the analysis previous to the\nreevaluation of the reactor fluxes, and to the publication of the MiniBoone antineutrino\ndata. Nevertheless, there is still a tension between the LSND/MiniBoone appearance and\nthe muon disappearence experiments.\nAccording to [14], a good fit to the data is obtained with:\n1. Two neutrino mass differences around 1 eV (more precisely around 0.5 eV and 0.9\neV).\n2. In the phenomenological parametrization, large enough |Ue4 |, |Ue5 |, |U\u03bc4 | and |U\u03bc5 |,\naround 10\u22121 .\n3. CP-violation.\nSince the parametrization for the phenomenological 3+2 model contains all the possible\nphysical parameters when there are 5 mass eigenstates, our model can be described by the\nsame parametrization although there are correlations between the parameters, in particular between the masses and angles. In particular for the degenerate case, according to\neq. (3.23), we have\n(Umix )e4 = s13 s34 ,\n(Umix )e5 = c13 s12 s25 ,\n(Umix )\u03bc4 = c13 s23 s34 ,\n(Umix )\u03bc5 = (c12 c23 \u2212 s12 s13 s23 )s25 ,\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n(6.1)\n\n\fwith\ns25 \u2248 mD\u2212 /M,\n\ns34 \u2248 \u2212mD+ /M,\n\n(6.2)\n\nfor M in the eV range.\nConcerning the massive states, their masses are: (\u223c m2D\u2212 /M, \u223c m2D+ /M, \u223c M, \u223c M ).\nTherefore, after taking into account the results from the above sections, the only parameter\nwe can play with is the Majorana mass M , and therefore in the degenerate case it is not\neasy to accommodate two distinct eV masses. On the other hand the matrix elements\nUe4/5 are intriguingly in the right ballpark.\nIn order to have a more explicit prediction we have evaluated the Pee and Pe\u03bc oscillation\nprobabilities in the mini-seesaw regime analytically via a perturbative expansion in the\nsmall parameters\n\u0010 m \u00112\n\u0010 m \u00112\nD\u2212\nD+\n\u01eb\u2212 =\n,\n\u01eb+ =\n.\n(6.3)\nM\nM\nAt second order in \u01eb\u00b1 we get for the ten mass differences:\n\u2206m2ij = O(\u01eb2 M 2 ), \u2206m24i \u223c \u2206m25i \u223c M 2 (1 + O(\u01eb2 )), \u2206m254 \u223c O(\u01ebM 2 ), i, j = 1, 3.(6.4)\nAt the same order in \u01eb\u00b1 the mixing angles are:\nsin2 \u03b825 = \u01eb\u2212 \u2212 3\u01eb2\u2212 , sin2 \u03b834 = \u01eb+ \u2212 3\u01eb2+ ,\nand finally the oscillation probability is\n\u0012 2 \u0013\n\u0001\nM L\nSS\n\u01eb2+ A44 + 2\u01eb+ \u01eb\u2212 A54 + \u01eb2\u2212 A55 + O(\u01eb3\u00b1 ),\nPe\u03bc\n= 4 sin2\n4E\u03bd\n\n(6.5)\n\nwhere\n\nA44 = cos2 \u03b813 sin2 \u03b813 sin2 \u03b823 ,\nA54 = cos2 \u03b813 sin \u03b812 sin \u03b813 sin \u03b823 (cos \u03b812 cos \u03b823 \u2212 sin \u03b812 sin \u03b813 sin \u03b823 ),\n2\n\n2\n\n(6.6)\n\n2\n\nA55 = cos \u03b813 sin \u03b812 (cos \u03b812 cos \u03b823 \u2212 sin \u03b812 sin \u03b813 sin \u03b823 ) .\n\nIn the normal hierarchy case, \u03b813 is small and will introduce a suppression of the A44 and\nA54 coefficients with respect to A55 . For vanishing \u03b813 we get:\n\u0012 2 \u0013\nSS,N H\n2 M L\nPe\u03bc\n= 4 sin\n\u01eb2\u2212 AN H + O(\u01eb3\u00b1 ),\n(6.7)\n4E\u03bd\nwith AN H = c212 c223 s212 = 14 sin2 2\u03b8sol cos2 \u03b8atm \u223c 0.1. On the other hand, in the inverted\nhierarchy case, \u03b812 \u223c \u03c0/2. In the limit \u03b812 = \u03c0/2 we get:\n\u0012 2 \u0013\nSS,IH\n2 M L\nPe\u03bc\n= 4 sin\n(\u01eb+ \u2212 \u01eb\u2212 )2 AIH + O(\u01eb3\u00b1 ),\n(6.8)\n4E\u03bd\nwith AIH = c213 s213 s223 = 14 sin2 2\u03b8sol sin2 \u03b8atm \u223c 0.1. The inverted hierarchy gets therefore\nan additional suppression with respect to the normal hierarchy case due to the partial\ncancellation between \u01eb+ and \u01eb\u2212 .

Unfortunately this accidental suppression for the IH is responsible for the fact that the leading-order\nresult of eq. (6.8) is not sufficiently precise and higher orders are relevant, but in any case\nthe effect is too small. The numerical expressions for Pe\u03bc for L = 541 m in the range of\nenergies relevant for MiniBooNE are shown in Fig. 10 for the NH and IH, compared with\nthe best fit result of [14]. The strong suppression for the IH case is clearly seen. The\ndegenerate case cannot accommodate the LSND anomaly.\nA different situation is found in reactors, which actually set stronger constrains on\nSS\nMmin . The reason is that the effects on disappearance are only linear in \u01eb and not quadratic.\nIn the same perturbative expansion as before we find:\n\u0002\n\u0003\nM 2L\nSS\nPee\n= 1 \u2212 4 \u01eb+ s213 + \u01eb\u2212 c213 s212 sin2\n,\n4E\n\u0002\n\u0003\nM 2L\nSS\n.\nP\u03bc\u03bc\n= 1 \u2212 4 \u01eb+ c213 s223 + \u01eb\u2212 (c12 c23 \u2212 s12 s13 s23 )2 sin2\n4E\n\n(6.10)\n\nThis is the origin of the well-known tension between the LSND appearance signal and the\ndisappearance constraints, in the electron channel by the Bugey-3 experiment [43] and in\nthe muon channel by the CDHSW experiment [44].\nIn Fig. 11 we compare the exclusion plot of Bugey-3 and CDHSW with the prediction\nfor the effective mixing angle and frequency in the disappearance channels in the degenerate\ncase (note that the two are related). We can see that there is a very small additional\nexclusion of the allowed region for the IH, which sets\nSS\nMmin\n\u223c 1.6 eV,\n\n(6.11)\n\nwhile there is no further constrain for the NH case. Note that these bounds would be\nrelaxed if the new computation of the reactor fluxes is taken into account.\n6.2 Other bounds\nIt is clear that important constraints on the mini-seesaw region could also come from\ntritium \u03b2-decay [45, 46], which is sensitive to the combination2\nsX\n|Uei |2 m2\u03bdi \u2264 2 eV,\n(6.12)\nme =\ni\n\nand from cosmology. The amplitude of the neutrinoless double \u03b2-decay process on the\nother hand approximately vanishes for M \u226a O(100) MeV and therefore cannot constrain\nfurther the mini-seesaw region (see [48]).\nNaively one would expect that such bounds will be in the form of a maximal value of\nSS\nMmax in the mini-seesaw region.\n2\n\nIt is assumed that all mi \u226a \u2206E, where \u2206E is the energy resolution near the end-point. When non\ndegenerate neutrinos are considered the analysis is more complicated [47] and cannot be cast as an upper\nbound on the combination me .\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\fKMS\n\n0.001\n\nNH; M=0.6 eV\n\nP\u039ce\n\n10-6\n\nIH; M=1.4 eV\n\n10-9\n10-12\n\nL = 541 m\n10-15\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nE\u039d\n\nFigure 10: The P\u0304\u03bce antineutrino oscillation probability at L = 541 m as a function of E\u03bd for the\nNH (red, M = 0.6 eV) and IH (blue, M = 1.4 eV).

These estimates are however too naive [6], because for such large values of\nM , the heavy states are far from the end-point and the sensitivity to the heavy states\ncannot be cast into the form of their contribution to me in eq. (6.12)[47] . In fact, a more\ncarefull analysis along the lines of [6] shows that there is no bound on M from the present\nmeasurements of tritium experiments, neither for the NH not for the IH.\nMore stringent bounds are expected from cosmology, that imposes stringent constraints\non the number of thermalized relativistic species at the time of nucleosynthesis (BBN), and\nat recombination (CMB) [49]. Furthermore the large scale structure is already sensitive to\nneutrino masses in the eV range. Although a detailed calculation is required, both sets of\nSS maybe closing the eV window\nmeasurements will very likely add new information on Mmax\nfor this model.\n\n7. Towards the non-degenerate case\nAlthough a systematic exploration of the parameter space in the non-degenerate case will be\nstudied elsewhere, in this section we want to point out the usefulness of the parametrization\nintroduced in sec. 3, which makes it easy to study analytically in the mini-seesaw region\nthe oscillation probabilities in the same perturbative expansion introduced before.

For the NH on the other hand, they are too small. In\nFig. 12 we compare the probability for the best fit of [14]. We find that for \u03b845 \u223c 20\u25e6 and\n\u03c6 = 1.62\u03c0 the results for the appearance probabilities are quite similar and therefore the\nmodel can also reproduce the LSND/MiniBoone anomaly with a similar level of agreement\nas [14]. The signal in disappearance shown in Fig. 13 is slightly larger so probably there is\nmore tension between appearance and disappearance.\nFinally and in the same expansion we obtain for the tritium \u03b2 decay effective mass of\neq.

Quasi-Dirac neutrinos in the sun\nIn this section, we do an analytical study of the flavour transitions of quasi-Dirac neutrinos\n(solutions of Types I and II) in the sun in order to understand the very stringent limits on\nthe value of M set by solar data. A similar study has been discussed in [50], see also [51].\nOlder studies of pseudo-Dirac neutrinos in the sun were done in [52, 53].\nIn order to understand the reason for the sensitivity of the sun to tiny splittings in the\nstandard three Dirac neutrino scenario, we consider the NH case with \u03b813 = 0, which is a\n\n\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n\fgood approximation. The IH works similarly, after the appropriate mapping in the angles\n(in particular, \u03b813 = 0 is equivalent to \u03b812 = \u03c0/2), so in order to simplify the discussion\nwe just consider the NH case in the intermediate results and indicate the differences in the\nfinal results for the IH.\nLet us first consider the case M = 0, where the standard scenario must be recovered.\nThe eigenvalues in matter are:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nq\n1\n(0)\n2\n4\n2\n2\n\u03bc0 =\nA + mD\u2212 \u2212 A + mD\u2212 \u2212 2AmD\u2212 cos 2\u03b812\n2\nB\n(0)\n+ m2D\u2212\n\u03bc1 =\n2\u0012\n\u0013\nq\n1\n(0)\n2\n4\n2\n2\n\u03bc2 =\nA + mD\u2212 + A + mD\u2212 \u2212 2AmD\u2212 cos 2\u03b812\n2\n(0)\n\n\u03bc3\n\n(0)\n\n\u03bc4\n\n= m2D+\nB\n+ m2D+\n=\n2\n\n(8.1)\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere A = 2 2GF Ne E\u03bd and B = 2 2GF Nn E\u03bd . Since we are interested in a rough\nestimate, we will neglect Nn in front of Ne , that is B in front of A, since in the sun this\n(0)\nis not too bad an approximation. The corresponding eigenvectors, vi (A), fall in three\ninvariant subspaces : the 1, the 4 and 023. The standard 3\u03bd result corresponds to the 023\nsector where the usual two-family MSW is found in the sector 02. The MSW resonance\n(0)\noccurs at AM SW = m2D\u2212 cos 2\u03b812 . However, the eigenvalue \u03bc1 becomes exactly degenerate\n(0)\n\nwith \u03bc2 at A = 0. For M = 0, there is an exact level crossing because the levels do not\nmix. When M is non-zero, no matter how small, there is mixing and therefore an additional\nMSW effect in the sector 12 takes place, where the mixing is controlled by M , as we will\nsee.\n(0)\nIt is found that only the states vi with i = 0, 2 have an electron component, and\ntherefore the electron flavour state produced at the center of the sun is a mixture of both\n(0)\nvi (A0 ), where A0 corresponds to the value of A close to the center of the sun. In the\nadiabatic approximation, therefore, the probability \u03bde \u2192 \u03bde (ignoring possible effects due\nto Earth matter) is:\ni2\ni2 h\ni2 h\ni2 h\nh\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\n(v2 (0))e\n(v0 (0))e + (v2 (A0 ))e\nPee = (v0 (A0 ))e\n=\n\nm2D\u2212 cos 2\u03b812 \u2212 A0\n1 cos 2\u03b812\nq\n+\n.\n2\n2\nA2 + m4 \u2212 2A m2 cos 2\u03b8\n0\n\nD\u2212\n\n0\n\nD\u2212\n\nWe recover the expected Dirac result:\n(\nsin2 \u03b812\nA0 \u226b AM SW ,\nPee \u2192\n1\n2\n1 \u2212 2 sin 2\u03b812 A0 \u226a AM SW .\n\n(8.2)\n\n12\n\n(8.3)\n\nThe result for the IH case is equivalent after exchanging m2D\u2212 \u2192 m2D+ \u2212m2D\u2212 and \u03b812 \u2192 \u03b813 .\nThe relevant mass scale is therefore in both cases \u2206m2sol .\n\n\u2013 26 \u2013\n\n\fLet us now consider a value of M \u226a mD\u2212 < mD+ . We can do perturbation theory to\ninclude the effects of M for any value of A, but for A \u2192 0, the pairs of states 12 and 34\nare degenerate, and therefore standard perturbation theory breaks down. Non-degenerate\nperturbation theory is necessary here, which amounts to diagonalizing the perturbation\nmatrix exactly in the corresponding 2 \u00d7 2 subspaces, treating the rest in standard pertur(M )\n(M )\nbation theory. The resulting eigenvalues and eigenvectors are denoted by \u03bci and vi . If\nwe neglect all effects of O(M/mD\u00b1 ), we have that, for large A, the eigenstates go smoothly\nto those at M = 0:\n(0)\n(M )\n(8.4)\nlim vi (A) = vi (A).\nM \u21920\n\nHowever, for small A, more concretely for A \u226a M mD\u00b1 , the M \u2192 0 limit does not coincide\nwith the M = 0 case:\n\u0011\n\u0010\nsin \u03b812\n(M )\nlim v1 (0) = \u2212 \u221a ,\nM \u21920\ne\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\nsin \u03b812\n(M )\n(8.5)\nlim v2 (0) = \u2212 \u221a ,\nM \u21920\ne\n2\n(0)\n\nwhile (v1 (0))e = 0.\nIn the adiabatic limit, we find\ni2\ni2 h\ni2 h\ni2 h\nh\n(M )\n(M )\n(M )\n(M )\n(v2 (0))e\n(v0 (0))e + (v2 (A0 ))e\nlim Pee = lim (v0 (A0 ))e\nM \u21920\nM \u21920\n\u0012 2\n\u0013 \u0012 2\n\u0013\nA0 \u2212 m2D\u2212 cos 2\u03b812\nsin \u03b812 cos2 \u03b812\nsin \u03b812 cos2 \u03b812\nq\n+\n\u2212\n=\n+\n.\n4\n2\n4\n2\nA2 + m4 \u2212 2A m2 cos 2\u03b8\n0\n\nD\u2212\n\n0\n\nD\u2212\n\n12\n\nTherefore\n\nPee |N H \u2192\n\n(\n\nsin2 \u03b812\n2\ncos4 \u03b812\n\n+\n\nsin4 \u03b812\n2\n\nA0 \u226b AM SW ,\nA0 \u226a AM SW .\n\n(8.6)\n\nNote that for energies above the MSW resonance Pee is 1/2 of the Dirac result, so, to the\nextent that the adiabatic approximation is valid, the result for M 6= 0 is physically very\ndifferent to the Dirac limit.\nA similar analysis in the IH case is a bit more complicated, because in this case the\nproblem involves the two pairs of degenerate states and not just one pair as before.

(8.8) is maximal at the point in the evolution where\nA2 cos4 \u03b812 \u223c 4M 2 m2D\u2212 .\n\n(8.11)\n\nAt this point the non-adiabaticity condition reads\nE\u03bd \u03b1\n.\nM\u2264 \u221a\n4 2R\u2299 mD\u2212\n\n(8.12)\n\nq\nThe result for the IH is the same with the change \u03b812 \u2192 \u03b813 , but since mD\u2212 \u223c \u2206m2sol\np\nfor NH and mD\u2212 \u223c \u2206m2atm for the IH, the value of M for which the adiabaticity limit is\nreached is lower for IH than for NH, by the ratio of solar to atmospheric mass splittings.\nThe rough estimates are\n(\n10\u22127 \u00d7 E\u03bd (MeV)\nNH,\nM (eV) <\n(8.13)\n\u22128\n2 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 E\u03bd (MeV) IH.\n8.2 Dirac Limit\nNow that we have established that adiabaticity is lost, we must still prove that the Dirac\nlimit is reached for such small M . An easy way to see how this happens is to consider the\nsudden approximation. The evolution of the eigenstates shows an abrupt change in the 12\nsector at the condition of eq. (8.11). For larger A the eigenstates evolve smoothly and are\n(0)\nclose to vi (A), but at this threshold, the eigenstates 1 and 2 change abruptly to be similar\n(M )\nto those in vi (0). The sudden approximation assumes that the physical states do not\nchange abruptly and therefore a physical state that is an eigenstate as it approaches the\ntransition for A > Ath does not remain in an eigenstate for A < Ath . Oscillations therefore\noccur.\n\n\u2013 28 \u2013\n\n\f(M )\n\n(0)\n\nAt the center of the sun the electron neutrino is a combination of v0 (A0 ) \u2243 v0 (A0 )\n(M )\n(0)\nand v2 (A0 ) \u2243 v2 (A0 ) eigenstates. The two very fast decohere and the two components\nevolve adiabatically until the transition where\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n1 (M ) \u2212\n1 (M )\n1 (M ) \u2212\n1 (M )\n(M )\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nv2 (A+\n)\n\u2243\nv\n(A\n)\n+\nv\n(A\n)\n\u2243\nv\n(0)\n+\nv\n(0)\n, (8.14)\n1\n2\n1\n2\nth\nth\nth\n2\n2\n2\n2\nwhere we have neglected effects of O(Ath /m2D\u00b1 , M/mD\u00b1 ). The evolution of the 0 state is\nadiabatic throughout (this is different for the IH case).\nThe time evolution of the state after the transition point at t0 is approximately\n(M )\n\n(M )\n\n\u03bc1\n(0)\n\u03bc2\n(0)\n1\n1\n\u221a v1(M ) (0)e\u2212i 2E\u03bd (t\u2212t0 ) + \u221a v2(M ) (0)e\u2212i 2E\u03bd (t\u2212t0 ) .\n2\n2\n\nUsing eq.

In order to recover Dirac we need\ntwo conditions: 1) non adiabaticity and 2) long enough baseline for unaveraged vacuum\noscillations with the splitting M mD\u2212 . At the adiabaticity limit (eq. (8.12)), the oscillation\nlength is roughly the solar radius for all energies, and therefore the vacuum oscillations\nare averaged out on Earth. Smaller values of M are necessary to increase the oscillation\nlength. These features are precisely found in the exact Pee and Pea shown in Fig. 14 for\nthe NH and in Fig. 15 for the IH. For M \u223c 10\u22125 eV, the adiabatic result of eq. (8.12) is\nfound for all the energies shown. For M \u223c 10\u22126 eV the vacuum oscillations are seen for\nlarger energies while there are averaged oscillations still for the lower energies. For smaller\nQD\nvalues of M , the vacuum oscillations are seen at all energies, and for M \u2264 Mmax\nthe Dirac\nlimit is obtained.\n\n9. Conclusions and Outlook\nProbably the simplest explanation of neutrino masses involves the addition of singlet\nfermions to the SM. Such is the case in very different models ranging from Dirac neutrinos, to type I seesaws, inverse seesaw, etc. All these possibilities, that have very different phenomenological implications for flavour physics, correspond to different numbers\n\n\u2013 29 \u2013\n\n\f1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\nPea\n\n0.6\n\nPea\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n-0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n-1.0\n\n1.0\n\nM=10-5 eV\n0.0\n\n-0.5\n\nLog@EHMeVLD\n\nPee\n\n0.2\n\nM=10-6 eV\n0.0\n\nPea\n\n0.4\n\nPee\n\n0.2\n\nM=10-9 eV\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\nPee\n\n0.2\n0.0\n-1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n-1.0\n\n1.0\n\n-0.5\n\nLog@EHMeVLD\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nLog@EHMeVLD\n\nFigure 14: For the NH, Pee (red), Pea = Pee +Pe\u03bc +Pe\u03c4 (blue) at day time as a function of neutrino\nenergy for solar neutrinos (B) in the quasi-Dirac region for three values of M = 10\u22129 , 10\u22126 , 10\u22125 eV\nand normal hierarchy.

It is important to study the present\nconstraints on models with singlet fermions in increasing order of complexity, where complexity is measured by the number of extra degrees of freedom (Weyl fermions), nR , and\nnot by the physical spectrum, because the latter can depend also on the global symmetries\nimposed. With this perspective in mind, we have considered in the present work the two\nsimplest possibilities, that of one or two extra Weyl fermions, nR = 1, 2. The first case has\nsufficient free parameters (two masses and two mixing angles) to fit in principle the two\nconfirmed oscillations (solar and atmospheric), but a complete scan of the parameter space\nshows that it cannot fit all the available data from long-baseline reactor and accelerator\nexperiments (LBL). The case nR = 2 is equivalent to the standard 3\u03bd-mixing scenario (with\none massless neutrino) in two limiting cases: the Dirac limit (vanishing Majorana masses\nfor the extra fields) and the seesaw limit (large Majorana masses for the extra fields), and\nas such it does provide a good fit to the data in both limits. What happens in between\nthese limiting cases is much more complicated. We have thoroughly studied the allowed parameter space in this model by requiring that at least one mass splitting corresponds to the\nsolar one and another to the atmospheric one, and considered the simplifying assumption\nof degenerate Majorana masses, M . Even though many exotic solutions for intermediate\nvalues of M can fit very well reactor and accelerator data, they are shown to fail to explain\n\n\u2013 30 \u2013\n\n\fsolar or atmospheric neutrino data. We exclude therefore all regions except the quasiQD\nSS = 0.6(1.6) eV\nDirac, M . Mmax\n= 10\u22129 (10\u221210 ) eV, and the mini-seesaw for M & Mmin\nQD\nfor the NH(IH) respectively. The upper bound, Mmax , is essentially constrained by solar\nSS is set by LBL and reactor disappearance data. A\ndata alone, while the lower bound Mmin\nrelevant upper bound to the mini-seesaw region could clearly be obtained from cosmology.\nWe have discussed in detail the very stringent constraint imposed by solar neutrino\nexperiments on quasi-Dirac neutrinos.\nThe relevance of the mini-seesaw solutions to explain some of the unsolved neutrino\nanomalies: reactors, LSND, MiniBoone is discussed and discarded in the degenerate case.\nSuch anomalies cannot be explained in the context of the degenerate nR = 2 model within\nthe parameter space allowed by other neutrino oscillation experiments. However, we have\nargued that in the non-degenerate case, it is possible to obtain the pattern favoured by\n[14], although the same tension between appearance and disappearance still remains. The\nparametrization of Casas-Ibarra [11] in the mini-seesaw region of the general model has\nbeen used to derive accurate approximations of the oscillation probabilities in this regime.\nThe detailed constraints for the non degenerate case including CP violation will be\nconsidered in future work. We have not explored the restricted parameter space implied\nby a possible approximate lepton number symmetry, that can induce technically natural\nhierarchies in the spectrum. Such approximate symmetry could imply cancellations that\ncould have been missed in our scan, and need to be searched for more carefully. Such\npossibility, as well as the model with increased level of complexity implied by an additional\nWeyl fermion, nR = 3, are interesting avenues to be explored.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank M.
