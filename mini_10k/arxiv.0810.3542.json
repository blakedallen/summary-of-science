[1], relies essentially on the assumptions that the background is described by pure classical General Relativity (GR), while the perturbations\nthereof stem from quantum fluctuations. It is a semiclassical approach, where the background is classical and\nthe perturbations are quantized, and the fact that the\nbackground satisfies Einstein's equations is heavily used\nin the simplification of the equations. In Refs. [3, 4, 5],\nwhich assume the validity of the Einstein-Hilbert action,\nit was shown that such simple equations for quantum linear cosmological perturbations can also be obtained without ever using any equations for the background. This\ncan be accomplished through a series of canonical transformations and redefinitions of the lapse function. These\nresults open the way to also quantise the background,\nand use these simple equations to evaluate the evolution\nof the quantum linear perturbations on it. Indeed, such\nresults were applied to quantum bouncing backgrounds,\nand spectral indices for tensor and scalar perturbations\nwere calculated in Refs. [6, 7].\nThe matter content used in these papers were assumed\nto be either a single perfect fluid or a single scalar field.\nIn the case of perfect fluids, the equations were simplified\nup to their simplest possible form, both for tensor and\nscalar perturbations. For the case of scalar fields, this\nsimplest form was achieved for tensor perturbations but\nnot for scalar perturbations. One ended in a intermediate\nstage that needed further simplifications in order to be\napplied to quantum backgrounds Refs. [2, 4].\nMeanwhile, a non-singular inflationary model was\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: ftovar@cbpf.br\naddress: nelsonpn@cbpf.br\n\nfound Ref. [9] containing a single scalar field without\npotential term, which starts at infinity past from flat\nspace-time with Planckian size spacelike hypersurfaces,\nand inflates, due to a quantum cosmological effect, until\nit makes an analytical graceful exit from this inflationary epoch to a decelerated classical stiff matter expansion phase. It should be interesting to investigate if this\nmodel could generate an almost scale invariant spectrum\nof scalar perturbations, as observed Ref. [8]. However,\nwithout simple equations governing the evolution of the\nperturbations, the investigation becomes rather cumbersome.\nThe aim of this paper is twofold: complete the simplification initiated in Refs. [2, 4], and apply it to the background described in Ref. [9]. In fact, after performing\nsome canonical transformations at the classical level, and\nunitary transformations at the quantum level, we were\nable to obtain the simple equations for linear scalar perturbations of Ref. [1] for the case of scalar fields without\npotential, without ever using any classical background\nequation. These perturbation equations were then used\nto calculate the spectrum index ns of the background\nmodel of Ref. [9] yielding ns = 3, incompatible with observations [8] (ns \u2248 1). Hence, even though the quantum background model has some attractive features, the\nmodel should be discarded.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in the next section,\nwe briefly summarize the results of Ref. [9]. In section III,\nthe simplification of the second order hamiltonian for the\nscalar perturbations is implemented, and the full quantization of the system, background and perturbations,\nis performed. The quantum background trajectories are\nthen used to induce a time evolution for the Heisenberg\noperators describing the perturbations, yielding simple\ndynamical equations for the quantum perturbations. In\nSection IV, we calculate the spectral index of scalar perturbations in the background presented in Section II,\nusing the equations obtained in Section III. Section V\n\n\f2\nwhere the momenta are related to the velocities in the\nusual way:\n\npresents our conclusions.\n\nII.\n\nBOHM-DE BROGLIE INTERPRETATION\nOF A QUANTUM NON-SINGULAR\nINFLATIONARY BACKGROUND MODEL\n\nIn this section, we first briefly highlight the main characteristics of the Bohm-de Broglie quantisation scheme,\nrestricting our discussion to the homogeneous minisuperspace models which have a finite number of degrees of\nfreedom. We then apply it to the quantisation of the\nbackground geometry with a massless scalar field without potential term.\nThe Wheeler-DeWitt equation of a minisuperspace\nmodel is obtained through the Dirac quantization procedure, where the wave function must be annihilated by\nthe operator version of the Hamiltonian constraint\nH(p\u0302\u03bc , q\u0302\u03bc )\u03a8(q) = 0 .\n\n(1)\n\nThe quantities p\u0302\u03bc , q\u0302\u03bc are the phase space operators related to the homogeneous degrees of freedom of the\nmodel. Usually this equation can be written as\n1\n\u2202\u03a8(q)\n\u2212 f\u03c1\u03c3 (q\u03bc )\n+ U (q\u03bc )\u03a8(q) = 0 ,\n2\n\u2202q\u03c1 \u2202q\u03c3\n\n(2)\n\nwhere f\u03c1\u03c3 (q\u03bc ) is the minisuperspace DeWitt metric of\nthe model, whose inverse is denoted by f \u03c1\u03c3 (q\u03bc ).\nWriting \u03a8 in polar form, \u03a8 = R exp(iS), and substituting it into (2), we obtain the following equations:\n\u2202S \u2202S\n1\nf\u03c1\u03c3 (q\u03bc )\n+ U (q\u03bc ) + Q(q\u03bc ) = 0\n2\n\u2202q\u03c1 \u2202q\u03c3\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n2 \u2202S\nf\u03c1\u03c3 (q\u03bc )\nR\n=0 ,\n\u2202q\u03c1\n\u2202q\u03c3\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere\n\nQ(q\u03bc ) \u2261 \u2212\n\n\u22022R\n1\nf\u03c1\u03c3\n2R\n\u2202q\u03c1 \u2202q\u03c3\n\n(5)\n\nis called the quantum potential.\nThe Bohm -de Broglie interpretation applied to quantum cosmology states that the trajectories q\u03bc (t) are real,\nindependently of any observations. Equation (3) represents their Hamilton-Jacobi equation, which is the classical one added with a quantum potential term Eq. (5)\nresponsible for the quantum effects. This suggests to define\n\n1 \u2202q\u03c3\n.\n(7)\nN \u2202t\nTo obtain the quantum trajectories we have to solve\nthe following system of first order differential equations,\ncalled the guidance relations:\np\u03c1 = f \u03c1\u03c3\n\n\u2202S(q\u03c1 )\n1\n= f \u03c1\u03c3 q\u0307\u03c3\n\u2202q\u03c1\nN\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nEqs. (8) are invariant under time reparametrization.\nHence, even at the quantum level, different choices of\nN (t) yield the same space-time geometry for a given\nnon-classical solution q\u03b1 (t). There is no problem of time\nin the Bohm-de Broglie interpretation of minisuperspace\nquantum cosmology Ref. [10]. We will return to this\npoint in the next section.\nWe now apply this interpretation to the situation\nwhere H in Eq. (1) is given by\n\u221a\n\u0001\n2V\n(0)\nH0 =\n\u2212P\u03b12 + P\u03c62\n,\n(9)\n3\u03b1\n2`P l e\nwhich was worked out in Ref. [9]. The variables are\ndimensionless with \u03c6 describing the scalar field degree\nof freedom and \u03b1 associated to the scale factor through\n\u03b1 \u2261 log(a). The main feature of this model is the possibility to obtain a non-singular inflationary model similar\nto the pre-big bang model Refs. [21]-[24], with a minimum volume spatial section in the infinity past, or the\nemergent model Ref. [25] for flat spatial sections, without\nany graceful exit problem.\nWe take as solution of the background Wheeler-DeWitt\n(0)\nequation, \u01240 \u03a8(a, \u03c6) = 0, a gaussian superposition of\nWKB solutions. The resulting wave function is (see\nRef. [9] for details)\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\np\nh\n\u03c0\n2\n\u03a8(\u03b1, \u03c6) = 2 \u03c0|h| exp i \u2212 (\u03b1 + \u03c6) + d (\u03b1 + \u03c6) +\n2\n4\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nh\n\u03c0\n2\n+ exp i \u2212 (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03c6) + d (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03c6) +\n, (10)\n2\n4\nwhere h and d are two positive free parameters associated\nto the variance and the displacement of the gaussian superposition, respectively.\nThe norm of the wave-function is given by R =\np\n4 \u03c0|h| cos[\u03c6(h\u03b1 \u2212 d)], yielding the quantum potential,\nEq. (5),\nQ = (h\u03b1 \u2212 d)2 \u2212 h2 \u03c62\n\n.\n\n(11)\n\nThe guidance relations, given by Eq. (8) with the\nchoice N = \u221a`P2Vl e3\u03b1 , reduce to\n\u2202S\n,\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u2202S\n\u03c6\u0307 =\n,\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u03b1\u0307 = \u2212\n\np\u03c1 =\n\n\u2202S\n,\n\u2202q\u03c1\n\n(6)\n\n(12)\n\n\f3\ndte3\u03b1(t) \u21d2 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40 = Ei(3\u03b10 eht )/h, where Ei(x) is the\nexponential-integral function.\nR\n\nyielding\n\u03b1\u0307 = h\u03b1 \u2212 d ,\n\u03c6\u0307 = \u2212h\u03c6 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhich can be directly integrated to give\na = e\u03b1 = ed/h exp(\u03b10 eht ) and \u03c6 = \u03b10 e\u2212ht\n\n,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03b10 is an integration constant. Recall that the time\nparameter t is related to cosmic time \u03c4 through \u03c4 =\n\nThese solutions represent ever expanding non-singular\nmodels (see Figure 1). For t << 0 the Universe expands accelerately from its minimum size a0 = ed/h\n(remember that for the physical scale factor one has\n= \u221a`P2Vl ed/h ), which occurs in the infinity past\naphys\n0\nt \u2192 \u2212\u221e. The scalar field is very large in that phase.\nIf |ht| \u2264 \u03b10 is not very large, one has\n\na \u2248 e\u03b10 +d/h [1 + \u03b10 ht + (1 + 1/\u03b10 )(\u03b10 ht)2 /2! + (1 + 3/\u03b10 + 1/\u03b102 )(\u03b10 ht)3 /3!...].\n(15)\nR\nTaking \u03b10 >> 1, one can write a \u2248 e\u03b10 +d/h exp(\u03b10 ht). In that case, from \u03c4 = dta3 (t), one obtains that a \u221d (\u03c4 \u2212\u03c40 )1/3\nand \u03c6 \u221d ln (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40 ), as in the classical regime. Figure 1 exhibits the bohmian trajectories and quantum potential for\nthe parameters h = 3/5, d = 2, and \u03b10 = 2.\nOne step further is to consider quantum corrections\nto the background evolution itself, as in minisuperspace\nmodels, Ref. [11]-[14]. In this case, the simplifications\nin the equations for the linear perturbations using the\nclassical background cannot be implemented. It is worth\nto remind that the original lagrangian is quite involved,\nand the use of the background equation is a key step to\nrewrite the system in a treatable form.\n\nFIG. 1: Time evolution of the background variables. The\nsolid line describe the accelerated expansion of the scale factor\nfrom a finite minimum size a0 = ed/h . The long-dashed line\npictures the exponential decrease of the scalar field and the\nshort-dashed line gives the decrease of the quantum potential\nuntil arriving in the classical region. The parameters were\nchosen to be h = 3/5, d = 2, and \u03b10 = 2.\n\nIII. SIMPLIFICATION OF THE SECOND\nORDER HAMILTONIAN AND CANONICAL\nQUANTISATION\n\nThe conventional approach to deal with quantum cosmological perturbations is to consider a semi-classical\ntreatment that quantise only the first order perturbations\nwhile the background is treated classically. Once the\nbackground dynamics has a classical evolution, one can\nuse these equations to significantly simplify the second\norder lagrangian before quantising the system Ref. [1]. In\nthis case, the background evolution induces a potential\nterm that modifies the quantum dynamics of the perturbations.\n\nRecent works using technics for hamiltonian's systems\nRefs. [3, 4, 5] showed that it is also possible to simplify\nthe full hamiltonian system by a series of canonical transformations. Their main results focus in the scalar and\ntensor perturbations considering the matter content of\nthe Universe described by a perfect fluid. Even though\nin Ref. [2] and in the Appendix A of Ref. [4] it is shown a\nlong development that significantly simplifies the hamiltonian for a scalar field with a generic potential U (\u03c6),\nthere were still some delicate issues to be addressed to\nconsistently quantise the scalar field case.\nWe will not reproduce the development made in these\nreferences but we will continue the development of the\nabove mentioned Appendix. The main point to acquaint\nfrom this reference is that their simplification procedure use only canonical transformations, that guarantees\nthe equivalence between the original and the simplified\nhamiltonians, independently of the background equations\nof motion.\nIn the present work we will focus in the case of a vanishing potential U (\u03c6) and show how it is possible to consistently quantise simultaneously both the background\nand the perturbations. The background system is composed of a free massless scalar field in a spatially flat\nFriedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre-Robertson-Walker metric (FLRW).\nSince we are only interested in scalar perturbations, the\n\n\f4\nperturbed metric can be written as\n2\n\nds\n\n2\n\n2\n\ni\n\n= N (1 + 2\u03c6)dt \u2212 N aB|i dtdx +\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2212a2 (1 + 2\u03c8)\u03b4ij \u2212 2E|i|j dxi dxj\n\n. (16)\n\nThe matter content is defined by a free massless scalar\nfield \u03c6 (t, x) = \u03c60 (t) + \u03b4\u03c6 (t, x), where \u03c60 is the background homogeneous scalar field.

In this case, one can write ST (\u03b1, \u03c6, v) as\nST (\u03b1, \u03c6, v) = S0 (\u03b1, \u03c6) + S2 (\u03b1, \u03c6, v),\n\n(28)\n\nwhere it is assumed that S2 (\u03b1, \u03c6, v) cannot be splitted\nagain into a sum involving a function of the background\nvariables alone (which would just impose a redefinition\nof S0 ). Noting that, in order to be a solution of the\nHamilton-Jacobi equation (26), S2 must be at least a second order functional of v (see Ref. [27]), then S2 << S0\nas well as their partial derivatives with respect to the\nbackground variables.

In the perfect fluid case, the\nWheeler- DeWitt's equation assumes a Schr\u00f6dinger-like\nform, due to a linear term in the momenta connected\nwith the fluid degree of freedom. However, the hamiltonian (24) does not possess such linear term, rendering ambiguous the choice of an intrinsic time variable.\nNotwithstanding, we still can define an evolutionary time\nfor the perturbations if we use the Bohm-de Broglie interpretation. The procedure is similar to what is done\nin a semiclassical approach, where a time evolution for\nthe quantum perturbations is induced from the classical\nbackground trajectory (see, e.g., Ref. [16] for details).\nLet us summarize it in the following paragraphs.\nFirst of all, take the hamiltonian N H0 , with H0 given\nin Eq.

Note that, due to the transformation\n(22), v is now the Mukhanov-Sasaki variable divided by\na.

(32), the symbol O(4) represents terms coming\nfrom high order corrections to the hamiltonian (24). As\nwe are interested only on linear perturbations, this equation will not be relevant. The first equation (30) is the\nHamilton-Jacobi equation of the background which solution yields, together with Eqs. (29), the background\nclassical trajectories. Once one obtains the classical trajectories \u03b1(t), \u03c6(t), the functional S2 (\u03b1, \u03c6, v) becomes\na functional of v and a function of t, S2 (\u03b1, \u03c6, v) \u2192\nS2 (\u03b1(t), \u03c6(t), v) = S\u03042 (t, v).

Whether this\nprocedure is unambiguously independent on the choice of\nthe lapse function is a delicate point. Indeed, in a general\nframework (the full superspace), the bohmian evolution\nof three-geometries may not even form a four-geometry (a\nspacetime) in the sense described in Refs. [17, 18, 19, 20],\nalthough the theory remains consistent (Refs. [18, 19]),\nand its geometrical properties depends on the choice of\nthe lapse function. However, in the case of homogeneous\nspacelike hypersurfaces, a preferred foliation of spacetime\nis selected, the one where the time direction is perpendicular to the Killing vectors of these hypersurfaces. In this\ncase, once one has chosen this preferred foliation, one can\nprove that the residual ambiguity in the lapse function\n\n\f7\n1\n\u2212\n2\n\n(which is now independent of space coordinates) is geometrically irrelevant for the Bohmian trajectories (see\nRef. [10]). This is also true when linear perturbations\nare present, where the hamiltonian constraints reduce to\na single one, and the super-momentum constraint can be\nsolved, as it was shown in Ref. [7]. Again, the lapse function is just a time function. In this case, the bohmian\nquantum background trajectories can be obtained without geometrical ambiguities [10], and they can be used to\ninduce a time dependence on the perturbation quantum\nstate, as we will see.\nLet us assume, as in the classical case, that we can\nsplit AT (\u03b1, \u03c6, v) = A0 (\u03b1, \u03c6) + A2 (\u03b1, \u03c6, v) implying that\nRT (\u03b1, \u03c6, v) = R0 (\u03b1, \u03c6)R2 (\u03b1, \u03c6, v), and ST (\u03b1, \u03c6, v) =\nS0 (\u03b1, \u03c6) + S2 (\u03b1, \u03c6, v), and that A2 << A0 , S2 << S0 ,\ntogether with their derivatives with respect to the background variables.

Note that, as G\nis an arbitrary functional of v and the real parameter \u03bb, the functional \u03c7\u0304(t, v) constructed from (51) via\n\u03c7\u0304(t, v) \u2261 \u03c7(\u03b1(t), \u03c6(t), v) is also an arbitrary functional\nof t and v (even though \u03c7(\u03b1, \u03c6, v) in (51) is not arbitrary\nin \u03b1 and \u03c6).\nDuring our procedure, we have supposed that the evolution of the background is independent of the perturbations. This no back-reaction assumption is based on\nthe fact that terms induced by the linear perturbations in\nthe zeroth order hamiltonian are negligible, which should\nbe the case when one assumes that quantum perturbations are initially in a vacuum quantum state, as it is\nargued in Ref. [15]. We will come back to this point in\nthe conclusion.\nOnce one obtains the quantum trajectories for the\nbackground variables, they can be used to define a time\ndependent unitary transformation for the perturbative\nsector. This unitary transformation takes the vector |\u03c7i\ninto |\u03bei = U |\u03c7i, i.e. |\u03c7i = U \u22121 |\u03bei. With respect to this\ntransformation the hamiltonian is taken into \u01242 \u2212\u2192 \u01242U\nwith\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\nd \u22121\n\u22121\n|\u03bei .

In these expressions, the scale factor a = a(t) should be understood\nas a function of time, instead of an operator, since we\nsuppose that the background quantum equations have\nalready been solved.

[1]. The crucial point is that we have\nnot used the background equations of motion. Thus we\nhave shown that Eq. (58) is well defined, independently\nof the background dynamics, and it is correct even if we\nconsider quantum background trajectories.\nNote, however, that this result was obtained using a\nspecific subclass of wave functionals which satisfies the\nextra condition Eq. (46). What are the physical assumptions behind this choice?\nWhen one approaches the classical limit, where R0 is a\nslowly varying function of \u03b1 and \u03c6, condition (46) reduces\nto\n\u22022F\n\u22022F\n\u2212\n\u2248 0.\n2\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u2202\u03c62\n\n(59)\n\nIf Eq. (59) were not satisfied, one would not obtain anymore the usual Schr\u00f6dinger equation for quantum perturbations in a classical background (which arises when\nR0 is a slowly varying function of \u03b1 and \u03c6), due to extra\nterms in Eqs. (47) and (48): there would be corrections\noriginated from some quantum entanglement between the\nbackground and the perturbations, even when the background is already classical, which would spoil the usual\nsemiclassical approximation. This could be a viable possibility driven by a different type of wave functional than\nthe one considered here, but it seems that our Universe\nis not so complicated. In fact, the observation that the\nsimple semiclassical model without this sort of entaglement works well in the real Universe indicates something\n\n\f9\nabout the wave functional of the Universe[28]1 . In other\nwords, the validity of the usual semiclassical approximation imposes Eq. (59).\nWhen R0 is not slowly varying and quantum effects on\nthe background become important causing the bounce,\nthe two last terms of condition (46) cannot be neglected.\nThey would also induce extra terms in Eqs. (47) and\n(48), again originated from some quantum entanglement\nbetween the background and the perturbations, but now\nin the background quantum domain, and the final quantum equation (58) for the perturbations we obtained\nwould not be valid around the bounce. In this case, there\nis no observation indicating which class of wave functionals one should take and our choice in this no man's land\nresides only on assumptions of simplicity: there is no\nquantum entaglement between the background and the\nperturbations in the entire history of the Universe. This\nis the physical hypothesis behind the choice of the specific\nclass os wave functionals satisfying condition (46).\nIn the next section we will apply the above formalism\nimplying Eq. (58) to the specific example described in\nsection II.\n\nIV.\n\nAPPLICATION OF THE FORMALISM\n\nWe will now use Eq.

At\nt \u2192 \u2212\u221e, when the scale factor becomes constant and\n\n1\n\nIn these references, it is pointed out how the features of our Universe we take for granted (classicality, separability) impose severe\nrestrictions on the initial wave function of the Universe.

In fact, since in this region the scale factor is\nalmost constant, the wave number is also logarithmically\nrelated to the conformal time. This dependence is drastically different from the slow roll scenario, where the\nconformal time of potential crossing is inversely proportional to the wave number, k \u221d 1/\u03b7M .\nPerforming the matching at this time and taking the\nleading order term in k, one obtains that\nA1 (k) = k \u22121 A2 (k) \u221d k \u22121/2 exp[i6k ln(k) exp(2d/h)/h].\n(68)\nNote that solution (65) is valid everywhere, hence we\ncan use it in the period when the scale factor evolution\nbecomes classical.

[1] for the case\nof a scalar field without potential. The simplification procedure was carried out without ever using any classical\nbackground equation. Instead, by a series of canonical\ntransformations and redefinitions of the lapse function\nwe are able to put the hamiltonian in a form susceptible\nto quantization.\nHowever, contrary to the perfect fluid case, the scalar\nfield minisuperspace model has no natural way to define\na time variable since its hamiltonian constraint does not\ncontain a linear term in the momenta. Nevertheless, if\none assumes there is no back-reaction, we have shown\nhow to bypass this problem using the quantum background bohmian trajectories. The quantum background\ndynamics in the Bohm-de Broglie interpretation naturally provides an evolutionary time to the perturbative\n\nsector, similarly to what is done at the semiclassical level\nthrough the classical background trajectories [16].\nThese perturbation equations were then used to calculate the spectrum index ns of the background model of\nRef. [9] yielding ns = 3, incompatible with observations\nRef. [8] (ns \u2248 1). This result is intimately related to the\nlogarithmically dependence of the wave number to the\npotential crossing time, see eq. (67). As a consequence,\nthe model should be discarded. This is an example of an\ninflationary model without (almost) scale invariant scalar\nperturbations.\nThe no back-reaction hypothesis we have used was justified through the assumption that the perturbations are\nin a quantum vacuum state initially [15]. One could\nverify the consistency of such hypothesis by checking\nwhether the perturbations calculated under this assumption never departs the linear regime in the region where\nthe background is influenced by quantum effects. This\ncheck was done in other frameworks (see Ref. [7]), where\nself-consistency was verified. This self-consistency check,\nhowever, was not implemented here because the model\nstudied in section IV does not present a scale invariant spectrum for long-wavelength perturbations, and the\nmodel should be discarded without the need of calculating the amplitude of perturbations.\nWe have also assumed that there is no quantum entanglement in such a way that the background disturbs\nthe quantum evolution of the perturbations. This is a\nrestriction on the possible wave functionals of the Universe, which should then satisfy condition (46). It should\nbe interesting to investigate situations where entaglement is allowed when the background is in the quantum\nregime, which would imply modifications of Eq. (58) at\nthe bounce. In this case, condition (46) reduces to condition (59) (no entaglement when the background becomes\nclassical).\nSome future investigations should be to apply the formalism to bouncing models obtained in the framework of\nquantum cosmology with scalar fields without potential\ndescribed in Ref. [26] in order to evaluate their spectral\nindex. We will also study the possibility to generalize\nthe simplification of the perturbation equations obtained\nhere to the case of scalar fields with an arbitrary potential\nterm.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank CNPq of Brazil for financial support.
