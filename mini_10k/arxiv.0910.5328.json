Introduction\nMulti wavelength studies of \u03b3-ray active galactic nuclei (AGNs) date back to the late '70s\nand the early '80s with the COS\u2013B detection of 3C 273 (Swanenburg et al. 1978;\nBignami et al. 1981). Nevertheless, the paucity\nof extragalactic \u03b3-ray source detected by SAS2 and COS-B prevented systematic multi frequency studies. It was during the '90s, with\nthe launch of CGRO, that EGRET allowed to\nestablish blazars as a class of \u03b3-ray emitters\nand to start multi wavelength studies of such\nsources. For a few sources, it was possible\nto study both the properties of the SEDs during different \u03b3-ray states, and the search for\ncorrelated variability at different bands, as for\n3C 279 (Hartman et al. 2001a,b).\nSend offprint requests to: S. Vercellone\n\nThe recent launches of the AGILE and\nFermi satellites allowed the blazar community\nto observe a large fraction of the sky above\n100 MeV, thanks to their wide (\u223c 3 sr) field of\nview (FoV), and to start a more effective multi\nwavelength approach in their spectral energy\ndistribution investigation.\n\nIn the following, I will briefly introduce\nthe AGILE satellite, and then I will focus on\nthe AGILE results on the studies of \u03b3-ray\nblazars. Particular emphasis will be given to\nthe importance of simultaneous (or at least, coordinated) multi wavelength observations, in\norder to study both the broad-band properties,\nand the correlations between the emission at\ndifferent frequencies.\n\n\f2\n\nVercellone: Multi-frequency behavior of blazars in the AGILE era\n\n2. The AGILE Mission\nThe launch of the AGILE satellite in April\n2007 (Tavani et al. 2009) allowed us to efficiently monitor, between 30 MeV and 30 GeV,\nseveral objects during the same pointing,\nthanks to the 3 sr FoV of the Gamma-Ray\nImaging Detector (GRID), and -for the first\ntime- to simultaneously monitor the central\nsteradian of the GRID FoV in the 18\u201360 keV\nenergy band, by means of the Super\u2013AGILE\ndetector.\nThe AGILE scientific instrument is very\ncompact and combines four active detectors\nyielding broad-band coverage from hard Xrays to gamma-rays: a Silicon Tracker (ST;\nPrest et al. 2003, 30 MeV\u201330 GeV), a coaligned coded-mask hard X-ray imager (SA;\nFeroci et al. 2007, 18\u201360 keV), a non-imaging\nCsI Mini\u2013Calorimeter (MCAL; Labanti et al.\n2009, 0.3\u2013100 MeV), and a segmented\nAnti-Coincidence System (ACS; Perotti et al.\n2006).\n\n3. The AGILE Multi wavelength\napproach\nMost of the AGILE campaigns were coordinated with other observatories at different\nwavelengths, such as Spitzer, Swift, Suzaku,\nINTEGRAL, RXTE, MAGIC, VERITAS, the\nWEBT Consortium, and REM.\nThis approach, based on pre-approved target of opportunity (ToO) guest investigator\n(GI) proposals, Director discretionary time\n(DDT) requests, monitoring programs, and bilateral agreements, allowed the AGILE Team\nto obtain truly simultaneous data on specific\nsources, covering the entire blazar spectral energy distribution, from 109 to 1026 Hz.\nIn particular, in order to obtain an as dense\nas possible optical coverage of \u03b3-ray sources\nduring the AGILE observations, we established a tight and fruitful collaboration with\nthe GLAST-AGILE Support Program (GASP)\norganized within the Whole Earth Blazar\nTelescope (WEBT), which provides radio-tooptical long-term continuous monitoring of a\nlist of selected \u03b3-ray -loud blazars.\n\nMoreover, in order to monitor the synchrotron to inverse Compton region of the\nSED, the most effective satellite in orbit is\nSwift, because of its rapid reaction to ToO requests (of the order of a few hours) and because of its broad-band coverage, from the\noptical-UV, the soft X-rays, up to the hard Xrays. Several GI programs and ToO observations were performed, for a total of a few hundreds ksec.\n\n4. AGILE blazar properties\nDuring the first two years of operations AGILE\ndetected several blazars in a high \u03b3-ray state.\nTable 1 lists the blazars detected so far with\ntheir main properties and references.\nAmong AGNs, blazars show intense and\nvariable \u03b3-ray emission above 100 MeV\n(Hartman et al. 1999). Variability timescale\ncan be as short as few days, or last a few weeks.\nThe peak of the \u03b3-ray emission can reach very\nhigh fluxes, comparable to the flux of the Vela\npulsar. Moreover, since they emit across several decades of energy, from the radio to the\nTeV energy band, they are the perfect candidates for simultaneous observations at different\nwavelengths.\nTherefore, thanks to the AGILE wide FoV,\nwe can monitor on a long time scale several objects at the same time, studying both\ntheir variability behavior and their emission at\ndifferent bands. We can study the properties\nof the AGILE sample addressing the following subjects: \u03b3-ray variability and flaring duration, SED modeling, and time lags between the\nemissions at different wavelengths.\n\n4.1. \u03b3-ray variability and flaring duration\nVariability is a common feature in blazars, especially at high energy, where a factor of 10 is\nnot uncommon, even at short time scale (e.g.\nPKS 1622\u2212297, Mattox et al. 1997).\nAGILE observations showed different behaviors among \u03b3-ray blazars. Some of them\nshow no degree of variability, independently of\ntheir \u03b3-ray flux level above 100 MeV. Among\nhigh (F\u03b3 > 200 \u00d7 10\u22128 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 )\n\u03b3-ray flux sources, 3C 279 (Giuliani et al.\n\n\fVercellone: Multi-frequency behavior of blazars in the AGILE era\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

Before the AGILE campaign during March 2009, this source\nwas detected twice: in August 2007\n(Pucella et al. 2008) at an average \u03b3-ray\nflux FE>100 MeV = (195 \u00b1 30) \u00d7 10\u22128\nphotons cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the period August\n23 - September 1; subsequently, in March\n2008, the source was clearly detected by\nAGILE at a significance level of about\n7\u2013\u03c3, and at an average flux level over the\nentire period of FE>100 MeV \u223c 130 \u00d7 10\u22128\nphotons cm\u22122 s\u22121 (D'Ammando et al. 2009a).\nThe AGILE March 2009 campaign caught\nthis source in a very active state, showing\nthree distinct \u03b3-ray flares reaching peak\nfluxes above FE>100 MeV \u223c 400 \u00d7 10\u22128\n\n\fVercellone: Multi-frequency behavior of blazars in the AGILE era\n\nphotons cm\u22122 s\u22121 (D'Ammando et al. 2009b;\nPucella et al. 2009b; Vercellone et al. 2009c).\nThis long-lasting highly-variable campaign\nwill be presented in a forthcoming paper\n(D'Ammando et al. 2009c).\n\n4.2. Time lags\nThe simultaneous multi wavelength monitoring of selected blazars, in particular in the optical R band by means of the GASP project, allowed us to study the correlations and the possible time lags between the emission in the two\nenergy bands. Two sources were studied in detail, S5 0716+714 and 3C 454.3.\nS5 0716+714 was monitored simultaneously by AGILE and by the GASP-WEBT during Fall 2007 (Chen et al. 2008). The discrete\ncorrelation function (DCF, Edelson & Krolik\n1988) was applied to the optical and \u03b3-ray data.\nA DCF peak at \u03c4 = \u22121 day shows a possible delay of the \u03b3-ray flux variations with\nrespect to the optical one. A possible interpretation, within the synchrotron self-Compton\n(SSC) model which fit the source data, is that\nthe 1-day time lag in the \u03b3-ray peak emission\ncould be due to the light travel time of the synchrotron seed photons that scatter the energetic\nelectrons.\nThe DCF method was applied to the\nNovember 2007 observing campaign of\n3C 454.3, during which simultaneous optical (GASP-WEBT and REM) and AGILE\n\u03b3-ray data were used to study the possible\ncorrelation in the two bands. As reported\nin Vercellone et al. (2009a), The DCF peak\noccurred at \u03c4 = 0, and its value is < 0.5.\nThis indicates a moderate correlation, with no\nsignificant time delay between the \u03b3-ray and\noptical flux variations.\nDuring the December 2007 campaign on\n3C 454.3, Donnarumma et al. (2009b) found\na possible time delay of the \u03b3-ray flux variations with respect to the optical one of less\nthan 1 day (\u03c4 = 0.5 \u00b1 0.6 day), by an accurate\nanalysis of the December 12 optical and \u03b3-ray\nflares. This result is consistent with the typical\nblob dimension and the corresponding crossing\ntime of the external seed photons in an external\nCompton (EC) model for the second peak in\n\n5\n\nthe source SED. Similar results were obtained\nby Bonning et al. (2009) by means of the analysis of the simultaneous optical (SMARTS)\nand \u03b3-ray (Fermi) data.\n\n4.3. SED modeling\nAccording to Fossati et al. (1998) and\nGhisellini et al. (1998) there should be a sequence between the average SEDs of different\nblazar categories, based on the different power\nof the sources, which increases from the\nhigh-peaked BL Lac objects (the less powerful\nones) to the flat-spectrum radio quasars (the\nmost powerful ones), and the power of the\nexternal radiation field (weakest in the former\nones, highest in the latter ones).\nAGILE detected at least one object for each\nblazar category: 3C 454.3 (flat-spectrum radio\nquasar, FSRQ), PKS 0537\u2212441 (low-peaked\nBL Lac object, LBL), S5 0716+714 (intermediate BL Lac object, IBL), and MKN 421\n(high-peaked BL Lac object, HBL). Therefore,\nwe were able to perform detailed studies of\nsimultaneous SEDs for blazars belonging to\ndifferent sub-classes, and to investigate their\nemission mechanisms.\n\n4.3.1. Flat-spectrum radio quasars\n3C 454.3 is the typical prototype the FSRQ\nclass. During the strong optical and X-ray flare\nwhich occurred on May 2005, its SED was\ninvestigated by several groups (Giommi et al.\n2006; Pian et al. 2006; Villata et al. 2006;\nRaiteri et al. 2007), but no \u03b3-ray satellite was\noperative at that time.\nAGILE detected 3C 454.3 during a dedicated ToO activated immediately after a bright\noptical flare, in mid July 2007. Following\na report by Vercellone et al. (2007) about\nthe preliminary analysis of the \u03b3-ray data,\nGhisellini et al. (2007) compared 3C 454.3\nSEDs obtained at three different epochs (2000,\n2005, and 2007), speculating that their difference could be due to the different location of\nthe dissipation site (larger in 2000 and 2007),\nand different values of the magnetic field and\nLorentz factor.\n\n\f6\n\nVercellone: Multi-frequency behavior of blazars in the AGILE era\n\nIn November 2007, Vercellone et al.\n(2009a) discussed the SEDs computed during two high (FE>100 MeV > 300 \u00d7 10\u22128\nphotons cm\u22122 s\u22121 ) \u03b3-ray states. Fig. 4 shows\n\nFig. 5. 3C 454.3 SED during the AGILE\ncampaign in December 2007 (Adapted from\nDonnarumma et al. 2009b).\n\nFig. 4. 3C 454.3 SED during the AGILE campaign\nin November 2007 (Adapted from Vercellone et al.\n2009a). The dotted, dashed, dot\u2013dashed, and the\ntriple\u2013dot dashed lines represent the accretion disk,\nthe external Compton on the disk radiation, the external Compton on the broad line region radiation,\nand the SSC contributions, respectively.\n\nthe almost simultaneous SED of the blazar\n3C 454.3 across 14 decades in energy, acquired during one of this periods, precisely\nbetween MJD 54423.5 and MJD 54426.5. The\nSED modeling indicates that the contribution\nof the external Compton scattering of direct\ndisk radiation (ECD) can account for the\nsoft and hard X-ray portion of the spectrum,\nwhich shows only a moderate time variability.\nHowever, we note that the ECD component\nalone cannot account for the hardness of the\n\u03b3-ray spectrum. We therefore argue that above\n100 MeV, a dominant contribution from the\nexternal Compton scattering from broad-line\nregion clouds (ECC) seems to provide a better\nfit of the data during the \u03b3-ray flaring states.\nDuring the December 2007 campaign,\nDonnarumma et al. (2009b) investigated the\nbroad-band characteristics of 3C 454.3 also\nby means of Spitzer and Suzaku observations.\nThe former ones are very important, since they\ncover the synchrotron peak, while the AGILE\ndata cover, simultaneously, the IC peak. Fig. 5\nshows the source SED on 2007 December\n\n13, when the source was at an intermediate\n(FE>100 MeV \u223c 200 \u00d7 10\u22128 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 ) \u03b3ray flux level. In order to account for the hard\n\u03b3-ray spectrum and the relative lower value (\u223c\n300) of the electron break Lorentz factor with\nrespect to the November 2007 one (\u223c 500), a\nhot corona component surrounding the jet is\nadded to the SED modeling, since this particular energetic regime seems to make the BLR\nphotons a too soft contributor at GeV energies.\nFurther important FSRQs detected\nby AGILE are 3C 273, 3C 279, and\nPKS 1510\u2212089.\nAGILE detected 3C 273 during a pre\u2013\nplanned 3-week campaign between December\n2007 and January 2008, with simultaneous\nINTEGRAL, RXTE, Swift, and REM coverage, and it was the first source detected simultaneously by the AGILE/GRID and by Super\u2013\nAGILE (Pacciani et al. 2009). The SED is consistent with a leptonic model where the soft Xray emission is originated from a combination\nof SSC and external Compton models, while\nthe hard X-ray and \u03b3-ray emission is compatible with external Compton from thermal photons of the disk.\n3C 279 is the first extragalactic source\never detected by AGILE in the \u03b3-ray energy band, in July 2007. The almost simultaneous observations of 3C 279 by means of\nSwift/XRT and REM, allowed us to investigate\nthe SED and to compare it to previous SEDs\nreported in Hartman et al. (2001a). As shown\n\n\fVercellone: Multi-frequency behavior of blazars in the AGILE era\n\n7\n\nin Giuliani et al. (2009), we note that a soft \u03b3ray spectrum (\u0393AGILE = 2.22 \u00b1 0.23) can be\nunderstood in terms of a low state of the accretion disk before the \u03b3-ray observations, suggesting a dominant contribution of the external\nCompton of direct disk radiation compared to\nthe external Compton scattering of the broad\u2013\nline region clouds.\n\nAGILE detected PKS 0537\u2212441 between\nOctober 10 and 17, 2008. We also activated a multi wavelength campaign involving Swift (between October 8 and 17), and\nREM (October 7, 8, and 9). The results of this\ncampaign will appear in a forthcoming paper\n(Pucella et al. 2009a).\n\nThe AGILE detection of PKS 1510\u2212089 is\na clear example of the importance of a wide\nfield of view for detecting \u03b3-ray transients.\nDuring the August 2007 observation, as reported in Pucella et al. (2008), a simultaneous\nWEBT monitoring of this source allowed us to\ninvestigate the SED, which results to be consistent with a leptonic model where the external Compton scattering of the broad\u2013line region clouds can account for the \u03b3-ray emission.\n\n4.3.3. Intermediate BL Lac objects\n\n4.3.2. Low-peaked BL Lac objects\nAccording to its spectral energy distribution\nPKS 0537\u2212441 belongs to the low peaked BL\nLac objects. Strong and broad emission lines\nof Ly \u03b1 and C IV were observed by means\nof HST, and allowed Pian et al. (2002) to derive the redshift of the source at z = 0.896 \u00b1\n0.001. At this redshift the inferred properties of\nPKS 0537\u2212441 place it among the most luminous LBL objects. Fig. 6 shows the historical\nSED collected by Pian et al. (2007).\n\nFig. 6. PKS 0537\u2212441 SED during the multi wavelength campaign in 2005 (From Pian et al. 2007).\n\nAmong this blazar sub-class, S5 0716+714\nwas a particularly successful target for AGILE.\nIts SED properties were discussed in detail\nin two recent papers. Chen et al. (2008) discussed the \u03b3-ray and optical data collected in\nthe period 2007 September 7\u201312, during which\nthe \u03b3-ray flux was very high (FE>100 MeV =\n(97 \u00b1 15) \u00d7 10\u22128 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 ), with a\npeak flux about twice as high. The time lag between the \u03b3-ray and the optical flux variations\n(discussed in Section 4.2), and the fact that\nthe \u03b3-ray variability appears to depend on the\nsquare of changes in optical flux density, seem\nto favour a SSC interpretation of the SED, in\nwhich the emission at the synchrotron and IC\npeaks is produced by the same electron population, which self-scatters the synchrotron photons, with the caveat that two SSC components\nare needed to account for the source variability.\nA similar modeling was used by\nGiommi et al. (2008) in order to reproduce the source SED in the period 2007\nOctober 23 - November 1. Fig. 7 shows the\nmulti wavelength SED obtained with AGILE\nand Swift data. The authors found that the\noptical and soft X-ray fluxes had different\nvariability behavior, and that the 4\u201310 keV\nemission remained almost constant during the\nobservations. The different variability behavior\nobserved in different parts of the SED may\nbe interpreted as due to the sum of two SSC\ncomponents, one of which is constant while\nthe other is variable.\nAnother very important result obtained by\nthe analysis of the \u03b3-ray data is discussed in\nVittorini et al. (2009) where, assuming the recently measured redshift of this source (z =\n0.31 \u00b1 0.08) by Nilsson et al. (2008), they conclude that this source is among the brightest BL Lacs ever detected at \u03b3-ray energies,\n\n\f8\n\nVercellone: Multi-frequency behavior of blazars in the AGILE era\n\n(2009a). Fig. 8 shows the MKN 421 SED\ncollected during the high-energy flare. For the\n\nFig. 7. S5 0716+714 SED during the multi\nwavelength campaign in October 2007 (From\nGiommi et al. 2008).\n\nwith negligible disk contribution. Because of\nits high power and lack of signs for ongoing accretion, they argue that during the\n2007 \u03b3-ray flares S5 0716+714 approached\n(or just exceeded) the maximum power that\ncan be extracted from a Kerr black hole by\nmeans of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism\n(Blandford & Znajek 1977).\n\n4.3.4. High-peaked BL Lac objects\nDue to their particular SEDs, this blazar subclass is less easy to be detected by \u03b3-ray telescopes optimized in the energy range 0.1\u2013\n1 GeV, such as EGRET and AGILE.\nAGILE detected two HBLs during a dedicated ToO towards W Comae, following a\nflare in the TeV energy band (Swordy 2008):\nW Comae and MKN 421.\nThe latter triggered an immediate multi\nwavelength campaign involving AGILE,\nSwift, RXTE, GASP-WEBT, MAGIC, and\nVERITAS. The Super\u2013AGILE monitor detected a fast flux increase from the source\n(Costa et al. 2008) up to 40 mCrab in the\n15\u201350 keV energy band, about a factor\nof 10 higher than its typical flux in quiescence. A Swift ToO was immediately\nobtained and the observed flux was as high\nas F2\u221210 keV = 2.56 \u00d7 10\u22129 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nThe results of an extensive multi wavelength\ncampaign are discussed in Donnarumma et al.\n\nFig. 8. MKN 421 SED during the multi wavelength\ncampaign in June 2008 (From Donnarumma et al.\n2009a).\n\nfirst time, simultaneous MeV\u2013GeV (AGILE)\nand TeV (MAGIC and VERITAS) data allow\nus to study in an unprecedented detail the\ninverse Compton region of the SED, while\nWEBT, Swift, and RXTE data provide coverage of the synchrotron region. The analysis\nof the SED shows that the \u03b3-ray flare can\nbe interpreted within the framework of the\nSSC model in terms of a rapid acceleration of\nleptons in the jet.\n\n5. Conclusions\nDuring its first year of sky monitoring, AGILE\ndemonstrated the importance of its wide (\u223c\n3 sr) field of view in detecting transient sources\nat high off-axis angles. Moreover, its unique\ncombination of a \u03b3-ray detector with a hard Xray monitor allowed us to study in detail the\nhigh energy portion of the blazar SEDs.\nThe synergy between the AGILE wide field\nof view, its fast response to external triggers,\nand the availability of a network of groundbased telescopes, allowed us to obtain a multi\nwavelength coverage for almost all the detected sources, and to investigate the physics\nof different classes of blazars.\n\n\fVercellone: Multi-frequency behavior of blazars in the AGILE era\n\nMoreover, by means of long-term studies\nof selected objects, we were able to monitor both high and low \u03b3-ray states of different\nsources.\nFinally, archival data analysis is in\nprogress, and we start detecting dim and\nsteady sources (Pittori et al. 2009).\nAcknowledgements.
