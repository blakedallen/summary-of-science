We also\nprove similar results for higher moments of the volume of a random\nsimplex, in particular for the second moment, which corresponds to\nthe determinant of the covariance matrix of the convex body. These\nquestions are motivated by the slicing conjecture.\n\nKeywords: random polytope, Sylvester's problem, random determinant,\nslicing conjecture\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nFor a d-dimensional convex body K, let VK denote the (random) volume of\nthe convex hull of d + 1 independent random points in K. In [14], Mark\nMeckes asked whether for any pair of convex bodies K, L \u2286 Rd , K \u2286 L\nimplies\nE(VK ) \u2264 E(VL ).\nPart of this work was done while the author was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the College\nof Computing of the Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\u2217\n\n1\n\n\fHis \"strong conjecture\" claims that this holds. He also stated the following\n\"weak conjecture\": there exists a universal constant c > 0 such that K \u2286 L\nimplies\nE(VK ) \u2264 cd E(VL ).\nClearly, the strong conjecture implies the weak conjecture. He also asked\nabout the natural generalization to more than d+1 points, random polytopes,\nand higher moments. Matthias Reitzner also discusses the problem later in\n[18]; he asked whether K \u2286 L implies\nEX0 ,...,Xn \u2208K (vol conv X0 , . . . , Xn ) \u2264 EX0 ,...,Xn \u2208L (vol conv X0 , . . . , Xn )\nfor arbitrary n.\nWhile these are natural questions in the understanding of random polytopes, one of their main motivations comes from their connection with the\nslicing conjecture (also known as the hyperplane conjecture or slicing problem): All d-dimensional convex bodies of volume 1 have a hyperplane section\nof (d\u22121)-dimensional volume at least a universal positive constant. Meckes's\nweak conjecture is equivalent to the slicing conjecture (see the Appendix).\nThe slicing conjecture [4, 2, 7] is one of the outstanding open problems in\nasymptotic convex geometry; one of the reasons is its connections with classical problems in convexity, like the Busemann-Petty problem and Sylvester's\nproblem [7].\nIn this work we show that Meckes's strong conjecture has a negative\nanswer if d \u2265 4 and a positive answer if d is 1 or 2. More precisely, we show:\nTheorem 1 (random simplex). If d is 1 or 2, and K, L are two d-dimensional\nconvex bodies, then K \u2286 L implies\nE(VK ) \u2264 E(VL ).\nIf d \u2265 4, then there exist two convex bodies K \u2286 L \u2286 Rd such that\nE(VK ) > E(VL ).\nFor the case d = 3, numerical integration suggests that the same counterexample used for d \u2265 4 works for d = 3. Certain approximations used in\nthose integrals in the proof for higher d fail to give a proof for d = 3, while\nan exact evaluation of the integrals looks somewhat involved and is left as\nan open question.\n2\n\n\fFrom the proof of Theorem 1 one can infer the following counterexample:\nIn d dimensions, let L be the convex hull of a half-ball (say, the unit ball\nwith the constraint x1 \u2265 0) and a point at distance \u01eb > 0 from the center of\nthe ball (say, the point (\u2212\u01eb, 0, . . . , 0)). That is, L is the union of a half-ball\nand a cone. Let K be L with the tip of the cone truncated at distance \u03b4 > 0\n(say, K = L \u2229 {x : x1 \u2265 \u2212\u01eb + \u03b4}). Then the proof of Theorem 1 shows that\nthe pair K, L is a counterexample to the monotonicity for d \u2265 4 and \u01eb, \u03b4\nsufficiently small. Numerical integration suggests the same for d = 3.\nThe same counterexample and analysis work for higher moments and all\ndimensions larger than 1 (it is easy to see that for dimension 1 the monotonicity holds for all moments). More precisely, we show:\nTheorem 2 (higher moments). If d is 2 or 3, then there exist an integer\nk0 \u2265 1 and two convex bodies K \u2286 L \u2286 Rd such that for any integer k \u2265 k0\nwe have\nE(VKk ) > E(VLk ).\nIf d \u2265 4, then there exist two convex bodies K \u2286 L \u2286 Rd such that for any\ninteger k \u2265 1 we have\nE(VKk ) > E(VLk ).\nThe intuition for our answer to Meckes's question came from our solution to another simpler but related question asked by Santosh Vempala: is\nthe determinant of the covariance matrix of a convex body monotone under\ninclusion? (The covariance matrix A(*) is defined in Section 2) Here we show:\nTheorem 3 (determinant of covariance). If d is 1 or 2 and K, L are two\nd-dimensional convex bodies, then K \u2286 L implies det A(K) \u2264 det A(L). If\nd \u2265 3, then there exist two convex bodies K \u2286 L \u2286 Rd such that det A(K) >\ndet A(L).\nThe question by Vempala was also motivated by the slicing conjecture.\nAs we show in the Appendix, the following weaker version of it is equivalent\nto the slicing conjecture: There exists a universal constant c1 > 0 such that\nfor any pair of convex bodies K, M \u2286 Rd we have\nK \u2286 M =\u21d2 det A(K) \u2264 cd1 det A(M).\nThe high level idea of the proof of Theorem 3 is the following: To understand the monotonicity it is enough to compute and understand the derivative of det A(*) as one intersects the convex body with a moving halfspace\n3\n\n\f(Proposition 15). We then find conditions under which this derivative has\nalways the right sign (Lemma 11 and the proof of Theorem 3). In the proof\nof Theorem 3 it is shown that understanding such a derivative is enough.\nThe following formula explains the connection between the determinant\nof the covariance matrix and the expected volume of a random simplex:\nLemma 4. Let K be a d-dimensional convex body. Let X1 , . . . , Xd be random\nin K. Let \u03bc(K) := E X1 be the centroid of K. Then\n\u0001\ndet A(K) = d! EXi \u2208K (vol conv \u03bc(K), X1 , . . . , Xd )2\nd!\n=\nE(VK2 ),\n(1)\nd+1\nThe first equality is known and easy to verify, see e.g. [7, Proposition\n1.3.3], the second equality is a slight extension, see Section 3 for a proof.\nIn view of Equation 1, one would think that if a pair of convex bodies is\nan example that the monotonicity of det A(*) does not hold, then it is also\nsuch an example for the functional\nK 7\u2192 E(VK ).\nGiven these similarities, it should be no surprise that techniques and examples similar to those for det A(*) also work for the expected volume of a\nrandom simplex and higher moments.\nFor the proof of Theorem 1 we use a special case of Crofton's theorem1\n[20, Chapter 5], [11, Chapter 2]. Our special case is Proposition 16, which\nwe prove here for completeness, partly because the proof of this version is\nelementary and because originally the formula was an informal statement\ninstead of a theorem. Crofton's theorem has been formalized at least twice,\nonce with differential geometry [1] and another time with conditional probability [6]. It is likely that using either of these two versions one could prove\nTheorem 1 in a simpler but less elementary way.\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nLet K \u2286 Rd be a convex body. Let X0 , . . . , Xd be random points in K. Let\nVK denote the random variable VK = vol(conv(X0 , . . . , Xd )). Let vol(*) be\n1\n\nSometimes called Crofton's differential equation. It gives an expression for the derivative of a symmetric function of random points from a domain as the domain is perturbed.\n\n4\n\n\fthe d-dimensional volume function. Let volk (*) be the k-dimensional volume\nfunction.\nLet X be random in K. Let \u03bc(K) denote the centroid of K: \u03bc(K) =\nE(X). Let A(K) be the covariance matrix of K:\n\u0010\n\u0001\n\u0001T \u0011\nA(K) = E X \u2212 \u03bc(K) X \u2212 \u03bc(K)\n.\n\nWe say that K is isotropic iff \u03bc(K) = 0 and A(K) is the identity matrix. It\nis easy to see that any convex body can be made isotropic by applying an\naffine transformation to it.\nGiven K and a hyperplane H, the Steiner symmetrization of K with\nrespect to H is the convex body that results from the following process: For\nevery line L orthogonal to H such that the segment L \u2229 K is non-empty,\nshift the segment along L so that its midpoint lies in H. Similarly, given\nK and a halfspace H, Blaschke's shaking (Sch\u00fcttelung) of K with respect\nto H is the convex body that results from the following process: For every\nline L orthogonal to H such that the segment L \u2229 K is non-empty, shift\nthe segment along L so that one endpoint lies on the boundary of H while\nthe whole segment stays inside H (See [17] for a discussion). If a given\nhyperplane H does not intersect the interior of K, then we define Blaschke's\nshaking of K with respect to H as the shaking defined before with respect\nto the halfspace containing K and having H as boundary.\nWhenever we have a function defined on an interval [a, b] and we write\nthe derivative of f at a we (implicitly) mean the one-sided derivative.\nWe will need the following known results:\nTheorem 5 (Blaschke, [19, Note 1 for Section 8.2.3]). For any 2-dimensional\nconvex body K:\nE(VK )\n1\n\u2264 ,\nvol(K)\n12\nwith equality iff K is a triangle.\nTheorem 6 (Blaschke-Groemer, [19, Theorem 8.6.3]). Let k \u2265 1 be an\ninteger.

Most of the work is in proving the following\ndimension-dependent condition:\nLemma 11. Monotonicity under inclusion of K 7\u2192 det A(K) holds\n\u221a for some\nd\ndimension d iff for any isotropic convex body K \u2286 R we have dBd \u2286 K.\nProof. For the \"if\" part, suppose for a contradiction that K, L \u2286 Rd are two\nconvex bodies for which the monotonicity does not hold: K \u2286 L but\ndet A(K) > det A(L).\nBy the continuity of det A(*) and the density of polytopes we can assume\nwithout loss of generality that K is a polytope satisfying the same properties.\nLet m be the number of facets of K. Label the facets of K arbitrarily with\nlabels 1, . . . , m. Let Fi \u2286 Rd , i = 0, . . . , m be the following non-increasing\nsequence of convex bodies: F0 = L, Fm = K, Fi = Fi\u22121 \u2229 Hi , where Hi is the\nunique halfspace containing K and containing facet i of K in its boundary.\nThen there exists i such that Fi , Fi\u22121 is also a counterexample to the monotonicity. Let v be the unit outer normal to facet i of K. Consider the path\nfrom Fi\u22121 to Fi induced by pushing Hi in, formally, the path is given by, for\nt \u2208 [a, b]:\nF (t) = Fi\u22121 \u2229 H(t)\nwhere H(t) = {x \u2208 Rd : v * x \u2264 t} and a = supx\u2208Fi\u22121 v * x, b = supx\u2208Fi v * x.\nThe function t 7\u2192 det A(F (t)) is continuous in [a, b] and differentiable in (a, b)\nand the lack of monotonicity implies that there exists t\u0304 \u2208 (a, b) such that its\nderivative is positive at t\u0304. Now, even though this derivative is not invariant\nunder affine transformations, its sign is invariant. Thus, we can assume\nwithout loss of generality that Ft\u0304 is in isotropic position and Proposition 15\nimplies\n\u0001\nEX\u2208St\u0304 kXk2 < d\n\nwhere St\u0304 = Ft\u0304 \u2229 bdry H(\n\u221a t\u0304). In particular, there exists x \u2208 St\u0304 such that\nkxk < d, which implies dBd * Ft\u0304 .\nFor the \"only if\" part, suppose that there is \u221a\nan isotropic convex body\nd\nK \u2286 R and a point x \u2208 bdry K such that kxk < d. By continuity and an\napproximation argument, we can replace K and x without loss of generality\n7\n\n\f\u221a\nso that x is an extreme point of K, while still satisfying kxk < d and\nisotropy.2 Let v \u2208 Rd \\ {0} and a < 0 determine a halfspace H = {x \u2208\nRn : v * x \u2265 a} containing K whose boundary intersects K only at x. Let\nHt = {x \u2208 Rn : v * x \u2265 t}. Let Lt be the convex body K \u2229 Ht . Then by\ncontinuity, Proposition 15 and the fact that kxk < d, we have that there\nexists \u01eb > 0 such that for all t \u2208 (a, a + \u01eb):\nd\ndet A(Lt ) > 0.\ndt\nThis implies det A(K) < det A(La+\u01eb ) while La+\u01eb \u2286 K.\nProof of Theorem 3. Immediate from Lemma 11 and the fact that\np any ddimensional isotropic convex body contains the ball of radius (d + 2)/d\ncentered at the origin and this is best possible [15, 21],[10, Theorem 4.1].\n\n3.2\n\nProof of Theorems 1 and 2\n\nWe will now prove Theorems 1 and 2. We begin with a dimension-dependent\ncondition similar to that of Lemma 11.\nLemma 12. For a given integer k \u2265 1 and dimension d, monotonicity under\ninclusion of\nK 7\u2192 E(VKk )\nholds when K ranges over d-dimensional convex bodies iff for any convex\nbody K \u2286 Rd and any x \u2208 bdry K and X1 , . . . , Xd random in K we have\n\u0001\n(2)\nE(VKk ) \u2264 E (vol conv x, X1 , . . . , Xd )k .\nProof. The proof essentially the same as the proof of Lemma 11, with Proposition 15 replaced by Proposition 16, with q = d + 1,\nf (x0 , . . . , xd ) = (vol conv x0 , . . . , xd )k ,\nand without using isotropy.\n2\n\nFor example, add a point x\u03b1 = \u03b1x for \u03b1 > 1 and take the convex hull between K and\nx\u03b1 to get a convex body K\u03b1 . We have that x\u03b1 is an extreme point of K\u03b1 . For some \u03b1\nsufficiently close to 1 and T\u03b1 = A(K\u03b1 )\u22121/2 , we have T\u03b1 K\u03b1 isotropic and kT\u03b1 x\u03b1 k < d.\n\n8\n\n\fThen we verify the dimension-dependent condition for k = 1 in R2 by\nmeans of the following lemma (which gives a lower bound to the right hand\nside of (2)) and Blaschke's maximality of the triangle for Sylvester's problem,\nTheorem 5 (which gives an upper bound to the left hand side).\nLemma 13. Let K \u2286 R2 be a convex body and let x \u2208 bdry K. Then\nEX1 ,X2 \u2208K (vol conv x, X1 , X2 )\n8\n\u2265 2.\nvol K\n9\u03c0\n\n(3)\n\nProof. The continuity and affine-invariance of the lhs. of (3) and a standard\ncompactness argument imply existence of a minimum K and x.\nTo show the inequality, we will show with a series of symmetrizations\nthat a half of a ball centered at x minimizes the lhs. The intuition needed to\nunderstand the effect of Steiner symmetrization and Blaschke's shaking (see\nSection 2 for a brief review) is the following [17, Section 3]: If one picks three\npoints at random from three vertical segments in the plane that are allowed\nto move vertically, picking one point from each segment, then the expected\narea of the convex hull of those 3 points is a strictly increasing function of the\narea of the triangle formed by the midpoints of the segments. For example,\nthis implies that Steiner symmetrization decreases the expected area of a\nrandom triangle: The area of the triangle of the midpoints is zero when the\nmidpoints lie on a common line.\nHere is the sequence of symmetrizations:\n1. Steiner symmetrization: Let L be any supporting line of K through\nx. Let L\u22a5 be a line orthogonal to L through x. Let K\u0304 be the Steiner\nsymmetrization of K with respect to L\u22a5 . If K\u0304 6= K, then K\u0304 has a\nstrictly smaller value than K of the lhs. of (3), see [9, follows from\nLemma 4] or [5].\n2. Blaschke's shaking (Sch\u00fcttelung) with respect to L: for every chord of\nK\u0304 perpendicular to L, shift it in the direction orthogonal to L so that\nits endpoint that is nearest to L lies on L. The union of the shifted\n \u0304 . Lemma 14 shows that this\nchords is a convex body that we denote K\u0304\noperation can only decrease the value of the lhs. of (3). So we know\nnow that the set of pairs that are invariant under the previous step\nand this step contains a minimizer. Denote by S the family of pairs\nsatisfying such invariance.\n9\n\n\f \u0304 with its symmetrization\n3. The lhs. of (3) just halves if one replaces K\u0304\naround x, and this symmetrization is a centrally symmetric convex\nbody given the previous two steps. Thus,\ninf\n\n(K,x)\u2208S\n\nEK vol conv x, X1 , X2\nEK \u2032 vol conv 0, X1 , X2\n\u2265 2 inf\u2032\nK\nvol K\nvol K \u2032\n\n(4)\n\nwhere K \u2032 ranges over all centrally symmetric convex bodies. Lemma 9\nimplies that ellipses are the only minimizers of the rhs. of 4, and, as a\nhalf of an ellipse around the origin with the origin form a pair in S, we\nconclude that half of a disk centered at x is a minimizer.\nTo get the rhs. in (3), we just need to evaluate the lhs. for x = 0 and K\na half of the unit disk. For the numerator, the symmetry of the problem\nimplies that the average for a half-disk and the origin is the same as the\naverage for the disk and the origin. Thus, Theorem 8 implies\nE vol conv x, X1 , X2 =\n\n4\n,\n9\u03c0\n\nwhile the denominator in (3) is the area of a half-disk, \u03c0/2.\nWe believe that a half of an ellipse centered at x is the only kind of\nminimizer.\nProof of Theorem 1. For the first part (d \u2264 2), it is clearly true for d = 1.\nFor d = 2, Theorem 5 (Blaschke's maximality of the triangle for Sylvester's\nproblem) and Lemmas 12 and 13 imply the desired conclusion.\nThe second part (d \u2265 4) is a special case of Theorem 2.\nNumerical experiments suggest that a simplex and the center point of\na facet work as a counterexample for the monotonicity as in Theorem 1 in\nR3 , and it should work in higher dimensions. Similar numerical experiments\nsuggest that half of the unit ball and the origin is also a counterexample in\nR3 .\nProof of Theorem 2. Let K be the half-ball with xd \u2265 0.\nFor L the ball of volume vol(K), Theorem 6 implies\nE(VKk ) \u2265 E(VLk ).\n10\n\n\fTheorem 7 implies\n\u0001\n1\nE(VBkd\nk\n2\n\u0013d+1\n\u0012\n\u03bad(d+k+1) \u03c91 * * * \u03c9k\n\u03bad+k\n1\n.\n= k\nk\n2 (d!)\n\u03bad\n\u03ba(d+1)(d+k) \u03c9d+1 * * * \u03c9d+k\n\nE(VLk ) =\n\nOn the other hand, symmetry and Theorem 8 imply\n\u0001\n\u0001\nEXi \u2208K (vol conv 0, X1 , . . . , Xd )k = EXi \u2208Bd (vol conv 0, X1 , . . . , Xd )k\n\u0013d\n\u0012\n1\n\u03c91 * * * \u03c9k\n\u03bad+k\n=\n.\nk\n(d!)\n\u03bad\n\u03c9d+1 * * * \u03c9d+k\nCombining the previous claims we get:\n\u0001\nEXi \u2208K (vol conv 0, X1 , . . . , Xd )k\nk \u03bad \u03ba(d+1)(d+k)\n\u2264\n2\n\u03bad+k \u03bad(d+k+1)\nE(VKk )\n\n(5)\n\nWhen d is 2 or 3, a tedious but straightforward use of Stirling's formula shows\nthat (5) goes to 0 as k goes to infinity.

Without loss of generality, translate and rotate everything so that x\nis at the origin and L is the \"x\" axis. Let t > 0 be half of the width of K\nalong the x axis.
