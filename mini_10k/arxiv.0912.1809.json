In this note, we prove that smooth self-shrinkers in Rn+1 , that\nare entire graphs, are hyperplanes. Previously Ecker and Huisken showed that\nsmooth self-shrinkers, that are entire graphs and have at most polynomial\ngrowth, are hyperplanes. The point of this note is that no growth assumption\nat infinity is needed.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn this note, we show that smooth self-shrinkers in Rn+1 , that are entire graphs,\nare hyperplanes. A smooth one-parameter family of hypersurfaces, F : (0, T ) \u00d7\nM n \u2212\u2192 Rn+1 , is moving by mean curvature, if\ndF\n(1.1)\n= \u2212Hn,\ndt\nwhere n is the unit normal of Mt = F (t, M ) and H = div(n). Self-shrinkers represent a special class of solutions of equation (1.1), which do not change shape under\nmean curvature flow. Namely, for self-shrinkers, a later time slice is a scaled down\ncopy of an earlier slice. Self-shrinkers play a crucial role in studying the singularities of mean curvature flow. For instance, in [11] and [12], Huisken discovered a\nmonotonicity formula for mean curvature flow and proved that, around the singular\npoint\n\u221a (x0 , t0 ), if the blow-up rate of curvature is bounded above by a multiple of\n1/ t0 \u2212 t, then the rescaled hypersurfaces moving by mean curvature converge to\na self-shrinker smoothly. In the recent work of Colding and Minicozzi, they showed\nthat the only smooth embedded entropy stable self-shrinkers with polynomial volume growth in Rn+1 are hyperplanes, n-spheres and cylinders Rk \u00d7S n\u2212k , 0 < k < n,\nand classified the generic singularities of mean curvature flow; see [2]. On the other\nhand, self-shrinkers are minimal hypersurfaces in Rn+1 under the conformal metric\n\u2192\ngij = exp(\u2212|\u2212\nx |2 /2n)\u03b4ij ; see [1], [2] and [3]. In minimal hypersurface theory, the\nBernstein Theorem is one of the most fundamental theorems, and has many important applications, such as uniqueness and regularity of minimal hypersurfaces.\nThus it is natural to ask whether there is a Bernstein type theorem for self-shrinkers.\nEcker and Huisken studied mean evolution of entire graphs in a series of papers beginning with [7] in 1989. In particular, they proved in the appendix of [7] that\nsmooth self-shrinkers in Rn+1 , that are entire graphs and have at most polynomial\ngrowth, are hyperplanes. Later, in [8], they derived various interior estimates for\nmean curvature flow and proved the existence of smooth mean envolution of graphs\nwith only locally Lipschitz initial data. Also, in [5], Colding and Minicozzi proved\nsharp gradient and area estimates for graphs moving by mean curvature. In this\nnote, we study self-shrinkers using the L-stability operator, which was introduced\nby Colding and Minicozzi in [2] and [3]. We give an elementary proof of a Berntein\n1\n\n\f2\n\nLU WANG\n\ntype theorem for self-shrinkers in Rn+1 without assumption of the growth at infinity and without using gradient or curvature estimates for mean curvature flow.1 In\ncontrast to the Bernstein theorem for minimal hypersurfaces, which is true only for\nn \u2264 6 (see [14], [9] and [10]), our Bernstein type theorem for self-shrinkers holds for\nany n. The proof in section 2 is very simple in any dimension, while the proof of\nthe Bernstein theorem for minimal hypersurfaces is complicated even in relative low\ndimension; see [13]. The reason behind this is that smooth self-shrinkers in Rn+1 ,\nthat are entire graphs, have polynomial volume growth as minimal hypersurfaces\n(although the orders of volume growth are different), and a weighted stability in\u2192\nequality (2.2) with weight exp(\u2212|\u2212\nx |2 /4), which makes the right hand side of (2.2)\ntending to zero in any dimension by choosing appropriate cut-off functions.\nThroughout we use the subscripts x1 , . . . , xn and t to denote derivatives of func\u2192\ntions with respect to x1 , . . . , xn and t; \u2212\nx is the position vector in Rn+1 ; \u03c9n is half\nof the volume of the unit n-sphere in Rn+1 ; we define\nvi\n\n= (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0),\nith\n\nwhere i is an integer and i \u2208 {1, . . . , n + 1}. The main result of this note is that:\n\nTheorem 1.1. Suppose that the smooth function u(x1 , . . . , xn ) : Rn \u2212\u2192 R satisfies\nthe self-shrinker equation:\n!\nx1 ux1 + * * * + xn uxn \u2212 u\nDu\np\n(1.2)\ndiv p\n=\n,\n1 + |Du|2\n2 1 + |Du|2\nwhere Du = (ux1 , . . . , uxn ) and |Du|2 = u2x1 +* * *+u2xn . Then u = a1 x1 +* * *+an xn\nfor some constants a1 , . . . , an \u2208 R.\n\nRemark 1.2. We say that the graph of u in Theorem 1.1 is an entire graphical selfshrinker in Rn+1 and denote Graphu by \u03a3. Note that the left hand side of equation\n(1.2) is minus the mean curvature H of \u03a3 and the right hand side of equation (1.2)\n\u2192\nis \u2212h\u2212\nx , ni/2, where n is the upward unit normal of \u03a3. Therefore equation (1.2) is\nequivalent to\n1 \u2192\nx , ni.\n(1.3)\nH = h\u2212\n2\n2. Proof of Theorem 1.1\nFirst, we prove a weighted stability inequality for smooth self-shrinkers in Rn+1\nthat are entire graphs. In [2] and [3], Colding and Minicozzi introduced the operator\n1\n1 \u2192\nx , \u2207\u03a3 i + |A|2 + ,\n(2.1)\nL = \u2206\u03a3 \u2212 h\u2212\n2\n2\nwhich is given by the linearization of the self-shrinker equation. The weighted\nstability inequality in Lemma 2.1 below is equivalent to that \u2212(L \u2212 12 ) \u2265 0. On the\nother hand, they showed that LH = H in Lemma 5.5 of [2]. Let \u03b7 be a smooth and\ncompactly supported function on Rn+1 . And suppose that \u03b7 is identically one on\nBR and cuts off linearly to zero on BR+1 \\ BR , where BR is the open ball in Rn+1\n1It follows from Lemma 2.3 in the next section and the interior gradient estimate in [8] and\n[5] that the gradient of entire graphical self-shrinkers is bounded. Thus the proposition in the\nappendix of [7] applies. However, the point of this note is to give an elementary proof of a Bernstein\ntype theorem for self-shrinkers, which parallels the Bernstein theorem for minimal hypersurfaces.\n\n\fA BERNSTEIN TYPE THEOREM FOR SELF-SIMILAR SHRINKERS\n\n3\n\ncentered at the origin with radius R > 0. Thus, similar to the computation in the\nappendix of [3], we get\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212 2\n\u2192\n\u2212 2\n\u2192\n\u2212 2\n|\u2192\nx |2\n1\n\u2212 | x4|\n2 \u2212 | x4|\n2 2 \u2212 | x4|\nH 2 e\u2212 4 .\n\u03b7HL(\u03b7H)e\nH e\n\u2264\u2212\n\u2264\u2212\n+\n\u03b7 H e\n\u2212\n2 \u03a3\n\u03a3\nBR \u2229\u03a3\n\u03a3\\BR\nHence, if self-shrinkers have polynomial volume growth and let R \u2212\u2192 \u221e, then it\nfollows from the monotone convergence theorem that H = 0. And the only smooth\nembedded minimal cones in Rn+1 are hyperplanes.\nLemma 2.1. Let \u03b7 be a smooth compactly supported function on Rn+1 .

Let f = hn, vn+1 i. Colding and Minicozzi showed that Lf = 12 f in Lemma\n5.5 of [2]. For self-containedness, we include the proof here.

Since \u03a3 is self-shrinker, i.e.\n\u2192\nH = 21 h\u2212\nx , ni, thus,\n(2.3)\n\n\u2207\u03a3 H =\n\nn\nn\n1 X\n1X \u2212\n\u2192\nh\u2192\nx , \u2207ei niei = \u2212\naij h\u2212\nx , ej iei .\n2 i=1\n2 i,j=1\n\nHence,\n(2.4)\n\n\u2206\u03a3 f =\n\n1 \u2212\nh\u2192\nx , \u2207\u03a3 f i \u2212 |A|2 f.\n2\n\nNote that the upward unit normal of \u03a3 is\n(2.5)\n\n(\u2212Du, 1)\n,\nn= p\n1 + |Du|2\n\np\nand thus f = hn, vn+1 i = 1/ 1 + |Du|2 > 0.

Note that \u2202BR \u2229 \u03a3 divides \u2202BR into two components and let \u2202BR\nbe the\n\n\fA BERNSTEIN TYPE THEOREM FOR SELF-SIMILAR SHRINKERS\n\n5\n\ncomponent which has volume at most equal to \u03c9n Rn . Let \u03a9 be the region enclosed\n1\nby \u2202BR\n\u222a \u03a3. Hence, by Stokes' Theorem,1\nZ\nZ\nZ\nd\u03c9\n\u03c9+\n\u03c9=\nVol(\u03a3 \u2229 BR ) \u2264\n\u03a3\u2229\u2202\u03a9\n\n1\n\u2202BR\n\n1\n1\n\u2264 Vol(\u2202BR\n)+\n2\n\n\u03a9\n\nZ q\nx21 + * * * + x2n + u2 .\n\u03a9\n\nSince \u03a9 is contained in the cylinder \u03a9\u0303 = BR \u00d7 [\u2212 max{R, MR }, max{R, MR }], we\nconclude that\nZ\n1\n(R + MR ) \u2264 \u03c9n Rn + \u03c9n Rn (R + MR )2 .\n(2.14)\nVol(\u03a3 \u2229 BR ) \u2264 \u03c9n Rn +\n2 \u03a9\u0303\nTherefore,\nVol(\u03a3 \u2229 BR ) \u2264 2\u03c9n Rn (1 + R2 + MR2 ),\n\n(2.15)\nand C0 = 2\u03c9n .\n\n\u0003\n\nThird, we use the maximum principle for the mean curvature flow to bound the\nL\u221e norm of u on BR .\nLemma 2.3. Suppose that R > 1. Then there exists a constant C1 > 0, depending\non n and M2\u221an , such that MR \u2264 C1 R. In particular, entire graphical self-shrinkers\nhave polynomial volume growth.\nProof. Define\n(2.16)\nw(x1 , . . . , xn , t) =\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\np\np\np\nR2 + 1 \u2212 t * u x1 / R2 + 1 \u2212 t, . . . , xn / R2 + 1 \u2212 t ,\n\nwhere t \u2208 [0, R2 ]. We derive the evolution equation of w:\n(2.17)\n\ndw p\n= 1 + |Dw|2 * div\ndt\n\nDw\np\n1 + |Dw|2\n\n!\n\n.\n\nThus {\u03a3t = Graphw(*,t) }t>0 is a smooth family of hypersurfaces in Rn+1 moving by mean curvature (after composing with appropriate tangential diffeomorphisms). Similar to the arguments of Lemma 3 in [5] and [6], we construct suitable open balls as barriers. Let \u03c1 > 0 be some constant to be chosen later\nand a+ = supB\u03c1R w(x1 , . . . , xn , 0) + \u03c1R + 1. Consider the open ball B0+ centered at (0, . . . , 0, a+ ) with radius \u03c1R. It is easy to check that x21 + * * * + x2n +\n(w(x1 , . . . , xn , 0) \u2212 a+ )2 > \u03c1R, for any (x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 Rn . Thus B0+ and \u03a30 are\ndisjoint.p Let Bt+ be the open ball in Rn+1 centered at (0, . . . , 0, a+ ) with radius\nR1+ = \u03c12 R2 \u2212 2nt. Thus {\u2202Bt+ }t>0 is a smooth family of hypersurfaces moving by mean curvature and it shrinks to its center at T = \u03c12 R2 /2n. We choose\n\u03c12 > 2n + 1 to guarantee that \u2202Bt+ is not contained in the cylinder BR \u00d7 R, for\nt \u2208 [0, R2 ]. By the maximum principle for the mean curvature flow, \u03a3t and \u2202Bt+\nare always disjoint for t \u2208 [0, R2 ]. Indeed, assume that T0 is the first time that\n\u03a3T0 and \u2202BT+0 are not disjoint. Note that at every time t, the distance between \u03a3t\nand \u2202Bt+ can be achieved by a straight line segment perpendicular to both \u03a3t and\n1we choose the orientation of \u03a3 to be compatible with the upward unit normal and the orientation of \u2202BR to be compatible with the inward unit normal. Thus the orientation of \u03a9 is chosen\nsuch that the orientation of \u2202\u03a9 induced from \u03a9 coincides with that we just defined above.\n\n\f6\n\nLU WANG\n\n\u2202Bt+ . And outside B2\u03c1R \u00d7 R, the distance between \u03a3t and \u2202Bt+ is larger than \u03c1R.\n\u2192 \u2208 Rn+1 , and for t close to T , \u03a3\nThus at T0 , \u03a3T0 touches \u2202BT+0 at some point \u2212\nx\n0\n0\nt\n\u2192 in a\n+\nx\nand \u2202Bt can be written as graphs over the tangent hyperplane of \u03a3T0 at \u2212\n0\n\u2192. Thus for t close to T , the evolution equations of the\nsmall neighborhood of \u2212\nx\n0\n0\ncorresponding graphs are locally uniformly parabolic. Hence, the assumption violates the maximum principle for uniformly parabolic partial differential equations.\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore, we get the upper bound for w at time t = R2 :\np\nsup w(x1 , . . . , xn , R2 ) \u2264 a+ \u2212 \u03c12 \u2212 2n \u2212 1 * R\nBR\n\n\u2264 sup w(x1 , . . . , xn , 0) + \u03c1R + 1 \u2212\nB\u03c1R\n\n\u2264 sup w(x1 , . . . , xn , 0) +\n\np\n\u03c12 \u2212 2n \u2212 1 * R\n\n\u221a\n2n + 1R + 1.\n\nB\u03c1R\n\nSimilarly, define a = inf B\u03c1R w(x1 , . . . , xn , 0) \u2212 \u03c1R \u2212 1 and compare \u03a3t with \u2202Bt\u2212 ,\np\nwhich is centered at (0, . . . , 0, a\u2212 ) with radius R1\u2212 = \u03c12 R2 \u2212 2nt. Therefore,\n\u221a\n(2.18)\ninf w(x1 , . . . , xn , R2 ) \u2265 inf w(x1 , . . . , xn , 0) \u2212 2n + 1R \u2212 1.\n\u2212\n\nBR\n\nB\u03c1R\n\nIn sum,\n(2.19)\n\nsup |w|(x1 , . . . , xn , R2 ) \u2264 sup |w|(x1 , . . . , xn , 0) +\n\n\u221a\n2n + 1R + 1.\n\nB\u03c1R\n\nBR\n\nNote that w(x1 , . . . , xn , R2 ) = u(x1 , . . . , xn ) and\np\np\np\n(2.20)\nw(x1 , . . . , xn , 0) = R2 + 1 * u(x1 / R2 + 1, . . . , xn / R2 + 1).\n\nThus, by inequality (2.19) and the assumption that R > 1, we conclude that\n\u221a\n(2.21)\nsup |u| \u2264 2(sup |u| + 2n + 1)R.\nB\u03c1\n\nBR\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nHence, choosing \u03c1 = 2 n and C1 = 2(supB\u03c1 |u| + 2n + 1), gives MR \u2264 C1 R . \u0003\nFinally, we choose a sequence of Rj \u2192 \u221e and a sequence of smooth cut-off\nfunctions \u03b7j , which satisfies that 0 \u2264 \u03b7j \u2264 1, \u03b7j is 1 inside BRj and vanishes\noutside BRj +1 , and |\u2207\u03a3 \u03b7j | \u2264 |D\u03b7j | \u2264 2.
