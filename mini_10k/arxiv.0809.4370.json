This has led to the\ndevelopment of new concepts, such as the coordinate-transform design paradigm [2].\nMetamaterials consist of sub-wavelength-size wave-optical elements, namely resonant\n(for a particular frequency) electro-magnetic circuits, filling a volume. This structure\ngives them the wave-optical properties of a homogeneous material with macroscopic\nparameters, namely the permittivity, \u000f, and the permeability, \u03bc [1].\nMotivated by the desire to build optical elements that have some of the visual\nproperties of metamaterials on an everyday size scale and across the entire visible\nwavelength spectrum, we recently started to investigate sheets formed by miniaturized\noptical elements that change the direction of transmitted light rays (Fig. 1). In\nthe simplest case (which we consider here), these sheets are constructed to work in\nair, such that each light ray enters and exits the sheet on opposite sides with the\nsame intensity and without being offset, and that the change in light-ray direction is\nindependent of the position where the ray hits the sheet. In reality, the sheets introduce\na number of imperfections. They do, for example, offset transmitted light rays, but\nthe offsets are limited to the size of the individual elements' aperture diameter, which\ncan be miniaturized, in principle until ray optics breaks down (10s of wavelengths).\nNevertheless, a sheet's visual properties, and generally its ray-optical behavior, is well\ndescribed by macroscopic parameters that characterize the ray-direction change.

(a) An array of stacked, miniaturized, Dove\nprisms forms a Dove-prism sheet [3]. For illustration purposes, the Dove-prism\nsheet shown here contains only very few (10) Dove prisms. In our simulations\n(see Fig. 2(b) and (c)), the number of Dove prisms per Dove-prism sheet typically\nvaries between 100 and 1000. (b) Transmission through a Dove-prism sheet flips\none ray-direction component, in the case shown here the vertical component. As\nfar as this flipped ray-direction component is concerned, the effect is negative\nrefraction at the interface between media with opposite refractive indices (c).\n(d) Two parallel arrays of miniaturized lenses (\"lenslet arrays\") that share the\nsame focal plane, F , (that is, they are confocal) refract light rays approximately\nlike the interface between transparent media whose refractive indices, n1 and n2 ,\nhave a ratio n2 /n1 \u2248 \u03b7 = \u2212f2 /f1 , where f1 and f2 are the respective focal lengths\nof the two lenslet arrays [4].\n\nmetamaterials, such sheets \"are materials with designed properties that stem from\nstructure, not substance\" [5], so we call them metamaterials for rays (METATOYs)\u2021.\nBecause the ray-direction change in METATOYs is a generalization of refraction, we\ncall it meta-refraction.\nMeta-refraction can be familiar, like in confocal lenslet arrays that act\napproximately like the interface between optical media with different positive or\nnegative refractive indices (Fig. 2(a)) [4, 3]. It can also be very unfamiliar, like\nin Dove-prism structures (Fig. 2(b)) [8], especially those that rotate the light-ray\ndirection around the local sheet normal (Fig. 2(c)) [9]. Combinations of such rayrotation sheets can have unusual imaging properties [11], and a Fermat's-principle\ntreatment of light-ray rotation around the local sheet normal leads to a formulation\nin terms of an interface between complex refractive indices [12].\nHere we begin to investigate the wave optics of METATOYs. We investigate\nwhether every light-ray field that has been transformed by a METATOY has a\nsimplified wave-optical analog: a complex scalar field whose intensity is that of\nthe light-ray field, and whose phase gradient points in the light-ray direction. Our\ndefinition uses two approximations: the description of light by a single scalar field,\n\u2021 Note that different structured surfaces have previously been described as metamaterials [6].\n\n\fMetamaterials for light rays\n\n3\n\n\bA\n\nH\u001d\u0012\n\bB\n\nH\u001d \u0011\n\bC\n\nFigure 2. Example of views through METATOYs. (a) When an object is\nseen through confocal lenslet arrays (Fig. 1(d)), the distance between the arrays\nand the object appears to be stretched by a factor \u03b7. The two examples show a\nstationary chess piece (see inset) seen through confocal lenslet arrays with \u03b7 = 2\nand \u03b7 = \u22121, respectively making the chess piece appear further away and in\nfront of the arrays. (The latter case is the imaging case discussed by Pendry\n[7] for negative refraction between media with opposite refractive indices, but\nwithout restoration of the evanescent-wave components). (b) When seen through\na Dove-prism sheet (Fig. 1(a)), a straight line perpendicular to the sheet appears\nbent into a hyperbola [8]. Here the straight line is approximated by a thin green\ncuboid, shown on its own for comparison in the inset. (c) When seen through a\nray-rotation sheet [9], a cuboid appears twisted. Part of the cuboids in (b) and (c)\nextend in front of the sheet so that each cuboid's geometry can be appreciated. All\nviews are ray-tracing simulations through the detailed sheet structure, performed\nwith the free software POV-Ray [10]. Details of the simulations shown in (a) and\n(b) can be found in the references given. The ray-rotation sheet in (c) comprises\ntwo Dove-prism sheets [8], each containing 100 Dove prisms, that are rotated\nwith respect to each other through 60\u25e6 , together forming a sheet that rotates the\ndirection of transmitted light rays through 120\u25e6 around the local sheet normal.\n\nwhich is customary in a number of areas of optics (e.g. [13]), and the (arguably\nappropriate) ray-optics limit [14].\nNote that we are not calculating the light-wave field behind a METATOY, which\nis, of course, always possible. Instead, we ask the question if a simplified \u2013 but,\nwithin the scope of the simplifications, perfect (in the sense explained in section 2) \u2013\nwave-optical analog of METATOYs can exist, even in principle.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we define the wave-optical\nanalog of a light-ray field, and we find a requirement for this analog to exist. By\nstudying a simple example in section 3, we then construct light-ray fields without\nwave-optical analog. This allows us to formulate the condition for the existence of\n\n\fMetamaterials for light rays\n\n4\n\na wave-optical analog in terms of topological-charge density (section 4). Section 5\noutlines the relationship between our work and geometric transformations that cannot\nbe implemented exactly with continuous holograms. In section 6 we then study briefly\nthe conditions for particular types of meta-refraction to turn any light-ray field with\nwave-optical analog into another such field, which is the condition for the type of\nmeta-refraction to have a wave-optical analog. Finally, we provide conclusions.\n2. Wave-optical analog of light-ray fields\nA light-ray field is fully described by a three-dimensional field of normalized threedimensional direction vectors and an intensity field. For our purposes it is sufficient\nto consider the transverse (x and y) direction components in the z = 0 plane, which\nwe describe by the vector field\n\u0012\n\u0013\nrx (x, y)\nr(x, y) =\n.\n(1)\nry (x, y)\nWe restrict ourselves here to fields in which, wherever the intensity is non-zero, the\nlight-ray directions vary smoothly, by which we mean that the partial derivatives \u2202x rx ,\n\u2202y rx , \u2202x ry , \u2202y ry exist (we use the notation \u2202a b \u2261 \u2202b/\u2202a).\nWe define the wave-optical analog of such a light-ray field as follows. The\nanalogous monochromatic light wave, if it exists, is a complex field with a cross-section\nin the transverse plane of the form\np\n(2)\nu(x, y) = I(x, y) exp (i\u03c6(x, y)) .\nWe want this field to be \"non-pathological\"; we ask for it to be continuous and\ndifferentiable everywhere \u2013 the usual properties asked from a physical field. Wherever\nthe intensity I is non-zero, the phase \u03c6 then has to be continuous and differentiable.\nWe translate the ray field's brightness and direction into the complex field's intensity\nand three-dimensional phase gradient, \u2207\u03c6, respectively. The latter choice follows the\nusual ray-optics limit [14].\nWe have not yet specified the magnitude of the phase gradient.\nIn a\nmonochromatic plane wave of wavelength \u03bb, the magnitude of the phase gradient\nis 2\u03c0/\u03bb, so the relationship between the phase gradient and the (normalized) ray\ndirection is\n2\u03c0\n\u2207\u03c6(x, y) =\nr(x, y).\n(3)\n\u03bb\n(Note that \u03c6(x, y) and r(x, y) are defined such that this equation describes the x\nand y components of the three-dimensional phase gradient and normalized light-ray\ndirection, multiplied by 2\u03c0/\u03bb, in the z = 0 plane.) This is also generally the case in\nthe ray-optics limit, in which the wavelength is so short that, on the scale of a few\nwavelengths, any wave locally looks planar. This is the main scenario we consider\nhere.\nSometimes we also venture slightly further from the ray-optics limit by considering\na scenario in which the magnitude of the phase gradient is not 2\u03c0/\u03bb. This occurs\nroutinely in general monochromatic waves: in optical superoscillations, for example,\nthe magnitude of the phase gradient can be greater, even arbitrarily large, but\nconventional wisdom has it that this can only happen when the intensity gets very\nclose to zero \u00a7, and in special cases such as standing waves the phase gradient can be\n\u00a7 This particular \"conventional wisdom\" is a generalisation of special cases such as Ref. [15], and is\ncorrect in a statistical sense [16].\n\n\fMetamaterials for light rays\n\n5\n\nzero. In this \"less ray-optical scenario\" we therefore allow the phase gradient to be of\nany length, as long as it has a direction (i.e. length 6= 0), is finite, and does not point\nin the opposite direction from the light-ray direction k:\n2\u03c0\n(4)\n\u2207\u03c6(x, y) = f (x, y) r(x, y),\n\u03bb\nwhere 0 < f (x, y) < \u221e.\nWe now consider a METATOY immediately in front of the z = 0 plane, and\nconcentrate on the field immediately behind the METATOY. The existence of the\npartial derivatives of the components of r(x, y), specifically \u2202y rx and \u2202x ry , implies\nthat the mixed partial derivatives of \u03c6(x, y), \u2202x \u2202y \u03c6 and \u2202y \u2202x \u03c6, exist. Under these\n(and, indeed, less strict) conditions the theorem on the order of differentiation [17]\nholds, stating that\n\u2202y \u2202x \u03c6 = \u2202x \u2202y \u03c6.\n\n(5)\n\nUsing Eqn (3), this can be translated into the following condition on the transverse\nray directions, rx and ry :\n\u2202x ry = \u2202y rx .\n\n(6)\n\nIn the less ray-optical scenario, the corresponding condition is\n\u2202y [f (x, y)rx (x, y)] = \u2202x [f (x, y)ry (x, y)] .\n\n(7)\n\nIf a light-ray field does not satisfy Eqn (6) (or, in the case of the less ray-optical\nscenario, Eqn (7) for at least one function f (x, y) > 0) wherever the intensity is nonzero, then the phase \u03c6(x, y), and with it the complex field u(x, y) that corresponds to\nthe ray directions rx (x, y) and ry (x, y), cannot exist there. In this sense, Eqns (6) and\n(7) are therefore in the different scenarios necessary conditions for the existence of a\nlight-ray field's wave-optical analog.\n3. Example\nAs an example, we consider here a specific light beam passing through a METATOY\nimmediately in front of the z = 0 plane that rotates the light-ray direction through\n90\u25e6 around the z direction without offsetting the ray position. Such local ray rotation\ncan be achieved with combinations of Dove-prism sheets [9].\nWe consider a light-ray field which has, in the plane immediately in front of the\nray-rotating METATOY, the following properties. In the neighbourhood of the point\n(x, y) = (0, 0), the brightness is uniform and the light-ray directions are given by the\ngradient of the quadratic phase function\n\u03c60 (x, y) = x2 ,\nso the x and y components of the ray-direction field are\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2x\nr0 (x, y) = \u2207\u03c60 (x, y) =\n.\n0\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\nk In negative-refractive-index materials, the wave vector points in the opposite direction of the\n\"propagation direction\" [1]. We consider here only METATOYs embedded in a positive-refractiveindex material. We also restrict ourselves to homogeneous materials.\n\n\fMetamaterials for light rays\n\n6\n\nAfter passage through the METATOY, all ray directions have been rotated through\n90\u25e6 around the z axis, so in the plane immediately behind the METATOY the raydirection components are\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0\nr(x, y) =\n.\n(10)\n2x\nCan such a light-ray-direction field have a wave-optical analog? The x and y\ncomponents of r clearly violate the condition for the existence of a wave-optical analog\nin the ray-optics limit: substitution into Eqn (6) gives \"2 = 0\". In the less-rayoptical scenario, the situation is slightly more complicated: substituting the x and y\ncomponents of r into Eqn (7), we get\n0 = \u2202x (f (x, y)2x) .\n\n(11)\n\nThis condition can only be satisfied if\ng(y)\n,\n(12)\nx\nwhere g(y) is function of y that is greater than zero (as f (x, y) > 0). It is clear that, at\nx = 0, f (x, y) diverges to infinity and changes sign at x = 0, contrary to the conditions\nof the less ray-optical scenario. In either scenario the light-ray field given by Eqn (10)\ntherefore has no wave-optical analog.\nTo illustrate the lack of a wave-optical analog in the ray-optics limit in this\nexample, we consider a piecewise rotation of the phase. Figure 3(a) shows the\nquadratic phase function \u03c60 (x, y) described by Eqn (8). Figure 3(b) shows the result\nof dividing the z = 0 plane, and with it \u03c60 (x, y), into squares of equal size and\nrotating each square through 90\u25e6 around its center. Such piecewise phase rotation is\nan approximation to truly local light-ray rotation and an idealization \u00b6 of the effect\nof passage through local-light-ray rotators based on Dove-prism sheets [9].\nThe question then is whether or not it is possible to construct a continuous phase\nfunction from the rotated pieces of \u03c6(x, y) by moving the rotated pieces individually up\nor down. (We are not concerned here with the mechanism by which such a spatiallyvarying phase shift might happen; all we want to know is whether or not a phase\nfunction with the derivatives corresponding to the locally rotated ray-direction field\ncan exist.) Figure 3(c) shows the phase after all the pieces have been vertically shifted\nsuch that they fit together along the dashed lines. It is immediately clear that the\nresulting phase function is still full of discontinuities along at least two of each piece's\nedges, irrespective of the size of the pieces.\nIf we consider the case of rotation of the phase gradient at every point as a\nsimilar kind of piecewise rotation in the limit of infinitely small pieces, we find\nthat discontinuities along at least one edge of each piece of the phase translate into\ndiscontinuities which are infinitely small (they scale linearly with the size of the pieces),\nbut which exist at every point of the resulting phase function. Such a phase function\ncan be continuous everywhere, but it is not differentiable anywhere, and therefore it\ndoes not have an associated ray direction according to Eqn (3).\nMathematically, an effect of the pieces not fitting together like in Fig. 3(c) is that\nthe path integral of the phase gradient along closed paths, for example the path shown\nf (x, y) =\n\n\u00b6 Dove-prism ray-rotation sheets do not rotate the ray direction in square pieces, but they mirror\nthe ray direction in stripes, twice, whereby the stripes have a different orientation; they do not even\nmirror the phase in the stripes perfectly; and they change not only the phase, but the entire complex\nfield.\n\n\fMetamaterials for light rays\n\n7\n\n\bA\n\nPHASE\n\nPHASE\n\n\bB\n\nY\n\nY\n\nX\n\nX\n\bD\n\nPHASE\n\n\bC\n\nY\nX\n\nFigure 3.

(d) The thick solid arrow (red online) indicates a non-zero path integral\nalong a closed loop in the z = 0 plane.\n\nin Fig. 3(d), is non-zero. The closed-loop path integral around an infinitesimally small\nsquare of side length \u03b4, centred at (x0 , y0 ), can be written in the form\n\u0010\n\u2206\u03c6 = \u03b4 \u2202x \u03c6|(x0 ,y0 \u2212\u03b4/2) + \u2202y \u03c6|(x0 +\u03b4/2,y0 ) \u2212\n\u0011\n\u2202x \u03c6|(x0 ,y0 +\u03b4/2) \u2212 \u2202y \u03c6|(x0 \u2212\u03b4/2,y0 ) ;\n(13)\nthe condition for the path integral to be zero is\n\u2206\u03c6 = 0.\n\n(14)\n\nThe partial derivatives in equation (13) can be linearized to become\n\u2202x \u03c6|(x0 ,y0 +\u03b4/2) = \u2202x \u03c6|(x0 ,y0 \u2212\u03b4/2) + \u03b4 \u2202x \u2202y \u03c6|(x0 ,y0 )\n\n(15)\n\n\u2202y \u03c6|(x0 +\u03b4/2,y0 ) = \u2202y \u03c6|(x0 \u2212\u03b4/2,y0 ) + \u03b4 \u2202y \u2202x \u03c6|(x0 ,y0 ) ;\n\n(16)\n\nand\n\nEqn (14) then becomes\n\u2202y \u2202x \u03c6|(x0 ,y0 ) = \u2202x \u2202y \u03c6|(x0 ,y0 ) .\n\n(17)\n\n\fMetamaterials for light rays\n\n8\n\nWe have therefore derived Eqn (5) as a necessary condition for the existence of a\nfunction \u03c6(x, y) which is continuous and differentiable at position (x0 , y0 ). As we\nwant \u03c6(x, y) to have these properties wherever the intensity is non-zero, Eqn (5) has\nto hold wherever this is the case.\n4. Formulation in terms of topological-charge density\nThe closed-loop path integral (13) can be interpreted as enclosing a topological charge\n(phase change divided by 2\u03c0) of\n\u2206\u03c6\n\u03b42\n=\n(\u2202x ry \u2212 \u2202y rx ) .\n(18)\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nAs the area enclosed by the path is \u03b4 2 , we can define the topological charge density\n(topological charge per area):\n\u2206m =\n\n\u2202x ry \u2212 \u2202y rx\n\u2206m\n=\n.\n(19)\n\u03b42\n2\u03c0\nThe condition on light-ray fields to have a wave-optical analog can then be formulated\nin terms of this topological-charge density: Eqn (6), which has to hold wherever the\nintensity is non-zero, becomes \u03bc = 0. At those points where the topological-charge\ndensity is not zero, the light intensity has to be zero. This means that the product\nof topological-charge density and intensity, a quantity closely related to the density of\noptical orbital angular momentum [18], has to be zero everywhere:\n\u03bc=\n\n\u03bcI = 0.\n\n(20)\n\n5. Relationship with holographic geometric mappings\nOur work is closely related to work on phase holograms that map the intensity\ncross-section in the hologram plane of a collimated light beam into the hologram's\nFourier plane [19, 20]. Interesting mappings include rotation of the entire intensity\npattern around a point, which requires an everywhere-discontinuous phase pattern\nthat contradicts Eqn (5).\nIn practice, such transformations have been approximated with holograms that\nconcentrate the discontinuities. One approach [20] concentrates the discontinuities\nin points with integer topological charge (optical vortices). A similar approach could\nperhaps be applied to metarefraction, leading to an alternative type of METATOYs. In\nan alternative approach [19], the phase is piecewise continuous, and the discontinuities\nare concentrated in lines (the edges of the pieces). This latter approach is analogous\nto the piecewise phase rotation discussed in section 3.\n6. Wave-optical analog of meta-refraction\nThe conditions for which a type of meta-refraction has a wave-optical analog are those\nunder which Eqn (6) is satisfied by any light-ray field resulting from meta-refraction\nof an incident light-ray field that satisfies Eqn (6).\nAs our example we use ray rotation again. The incident light-ray field\n\u0012\n\u0013\nrx\nr(x, y) =\n(21)\nry\n\n\fMetamaterials for light rays\n\n9\n\ncorresponds to a wave-optical field, so it satisfies Eqn (6). The rotated light-ray field\nis\n! \u0012\n\u0013\n(\u03b1)\nrx\nrx cos \u03b1 \u2212 ry sin \u03b1\n=\n.\n(22)\n(\u03b1)\nrx sin \u03b1 + ry cos \u03b1\nry\n(\u03b1)\n\nIt has a wave-optical analog if it satisfies Eqn (6) with rx and ry replaced by rx\n(\u03b1)\nry , respectively:\n\u2202x rx sin \u03b1 + \u2202x ry cos \u03b1 = \u2202y rx cos \u03b1 \u2212 \u2202y ry sin \u03b1.\n\nand\n(23)\n\nBecause the incident light-ray field satisfies Eqn (6), all terms proportional to cos \u03b1\ncancel, so the condition becomes\n(\u2202x rx + \u2202y ry ) sin \u03b1 = 0.\n\n(24)\n\nThis means local ray rotation through an angle \u03b1 can have a wave-optical analog that\nworks for any input field, and therefore any arbitrary functions rx (x, y) and ry (x, y),\nonly if sin \u03b1 = 0, which is the case for rotation angles 0\u25e6 and 180\u25e6 . The rotation angle\n0\u25e6 trivially corresponds to no refraction at all, and the rotation angle 180\u25e6 formally\ncorresponds to negative refraction in which the refractive index changes sign, but not\nmagnitude (n1 = \u2212n2 ) + . For other angles, the rotated light-ray field can still have a\nwave-optical analog, provided it satisfies Eqn (24).\n7. Conclusions\nWe argue here that METATOYs are ray-optical analogs of metamaterials, and that\nthey can produce visual effects best described by ray-optical transformations that have\nno simple wave-optical analog. This might be the reason why such transformation have\nnever before been considered, let alone realized.\nWe have restricted ourselves here to the ray-optics limit of wave optics, as this\nis easiest to tackle. A natural continuation of this work would be a full, non-scalar,\nwave-optics treatment that translates light-ray direction into a suitable quantity like\nthe Poynting vector.\nAcknowledgments\nThanks to Stephen Barnett, Mark Dennis, Kevin O'Holleran and Carl Paterson for\nvery helpful discussions.
