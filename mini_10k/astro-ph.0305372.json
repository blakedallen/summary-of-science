On the other hand, the core to core variation of the [DNC]/[HNC] ratio, which range an order of magnitude, is more remarkable than the variation\nwithin each core. These results are interpreted qualitatively by a combination\nof three competing time-dependent processes; gas-phase deuterium fractionation, depletion of molecules onto grain surface, and dynamical evolution of a\ncore.\nSubject headings: ISM:abundances - ISM:clouds: - ISM:molecules: - radio\nlines:ISM\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt has been recognized that the deuterium atom is fractionated into various molecules\nin cold interstellar clouds and the isotopic abundance ratios of the deuterated molecules\nrelative to their normal species are as high as 10%, although the cosmic [D]/[H] ratio is\nonly an order of 10\u22125 (Wilson & Rood 1994). Deuterium fractionation is thought to be\ncaused by the following exothermic isotope-exchange reaction:\nHX+ + HD \u2192 DX+ + H2 + \u2206E,\n\n(1)\n\n+\nwhere HX+ represents a molecular ion such as H+\n3 and H3 O (Millar, Bennet, & Herbst\n1989; Howe & Millar 1993).\n\nSince the deuterium fractionation processes are sensitive to the physical conditions\nsuch as temperature, ionization degree, and depletion factor of molecules, deuterated\nmolecules can be used as unique tracers to investigate physics and chemistry of dense\ncores in dark clouds. Survey observations of various deuterated molecules such as DCO+\n(Butner, Lada, & Loren 1995), C3 HD (Gerin et al. 1987; Bell et al. 1988), DC3 N (Howe\net al. 1994), NH2 D (Saito et al. 2000; Shah & Wootten 2001), and DNC (Hirota, Ikeda,\n& Yamamoto 2001, hereafter Paper I) have been carried out toward a number of dense\ncores. Furthermore, various model calculations have been presented in order to account for\nthe observed deuterium fractionation (Millar et al. 1989; Howe & Millar 1993; Roberts &\nMillar 2000). A detailed study on chemistry of deuterated molecules has recently been carried out with sensitive observations of 10 deuterated molecules as well as chemical model\ncalculations (Turner 2001). According to these observations, deuterium fractionation of\nvarious molecules significantly varies from core to core, and also within each core, which\nis interpreted in terms of the difference in degree of depletion, ionization fraction, chemical bistability, and/or chemical evolution (Turner 2001 and references therein). However,\ndetailed observations are still limited to a small number of sources such as TMC-1, L1544,\nand L183, and also to a few specific molecular species such as DCO+ , N2 D+ , and NH2 D.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nIn order to study an origin of the variation of deuterium fractionation, it is important\nto investigate a possible relation between deuterium fractionation and abundances of other\nmolecules. Such a comprehensive study would constrain mechanisms of the variation\nmore strongly. On the basis of this motivation, we carried out survey observations of\nDNC and HN13 C toward 29 dark cloud cores, and found that deuterium fractionation of\n[DNC]/[HNC] (hereafter we just call DNC/HNC ratio) has a rough correlation with the\nNH3 /CCS ratio (Paper I). Since the NH3 /CCS ratio is regarded as an indicator of chemical\nevolution (Suzuki et al. 1992), this result suggests that deuterium fractionation reflects,\nat least to some extent, the chemical evolutionary stage of dark cloud cores. Particularly,\na significant gradient in the DNC/HNC ratio is seen along the ridge of TMC-1, which also\nshows the correlation with the NH3 /CCS ratio. Saito et al. (2002) also pointed out the\ngradient in the DCO+ /HCO+ ratio along the TMC-1 ridge, suggesting that it originates\nfrom the chemical evolutionary effect on the basis of chemical model calculations.\nNow it is of particular importance to study whether deuterium fractionation varies\nwithin a dense core, as observed in TMC-1, or not. With this in mind, we have carried out\nmapping observations of the J=1-0 lines of DNC, HN13 C, and H13 CO+ toward 4 nearby\ndark cloud cores, TMC-1, L1512, L1544, and L63. Furthermore, we have also conducted\nobservations of the J=2-1 lines of DNC and HN13 C toward selected positions to derive\ntheir column densities and H2 densities accurately. A related study for another dark cloud\ncore, L1521E, has already been reported by Hirota, Ito, & Yamamoto (2002).\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nMapping observations of the DNC, HN13 C, and H13 CO+ lines (J=1-0) were made in\nseveral observing sessions from 1997 to 1999 with the 45 m radio telescope at Nobeyama\nRadio Observatory2 . Their rest frequencies, dipole moments, and intrinsic line strengths\nare summarized in Table 1. The beam sizes (HPBW) were 20\u2032\u2032 and 17\u2032\u2032 for the 76 GHz and\n87 GHz regions, respectively. We used SIS mixer receivers whose system temperatures\nwere typically 300 K (SSB) including atmospheric attenuation. Toward L1512 and L63,\nthe spectra of DNC, HN13 C, and H13 CO+ were simultaneously observed with two different\nreceivers by using a polarization beam splitter; one receiver was used for DNC (76 GHz),\nand the other for HN13 C and H13 CO+ (87 GHz). The relative pointing error between these\ntwo receivers was less than 1\u2032\u2032 . Toward TMC-1 and L1544, the HN13 C and H13 CO+ lines\nwere observed simultaneously with the two receivers, while the DNC line was observed\n2\n\nNobeyama Radio Observatory (NRO) is a branch of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan,\nan interuniversity research institute operated by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and\nTechnology of Japan\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nseparately with only one receiver. The main beam brightness temperature is determined\nby dividing the observed antenna temperature by the main beam efficiency, \u03b7mb , which\nwas provided by the observatory to be 0.5 in the 76-87 GHz region. Acousto-optical radio\nspectrometers were used for the backend. The spectral resolution was 37 kHz, which\ncorresponds to velocity resolutions of 0.15 km s\u22121 and 0.13 km s\u22121 in the 76 GHz and 87\nGHz regions, respectively. Pointing was checked by observing nearby SiO maser sources\nevery 1-2 hours, and the pointing accuracy was estimated to be better than 5\u2032\u2032 (rms). All\nthe observations were performed with the position-switching mode, in which a typical off\nposition was 10\u2032 away from the source position.\nWe observed 4 dark cloud cores, TMC-1, L1512, and L1544 in the Taurus region and\nL63 in the Ophiuchus region, as summarized in Table 2. The reference positions were\ntaken from Suzuki et al. (1992) and Benson & Myers (1989) for TMC-1 and other cores,\nrespectively. Note that the reference position for L1544 listed in Table 2 is shifted by (27\u2032\u2032 ,64\u2032\u2032 ) from that commonly used, which is determined by the high-resolution observation\nof dust continuum emission (e.g. Ward-Thompson et al. 1994). The grid spacing (20\u2032\u2032 60\u2032\u2032 ) in the mapping observations was larger than the beam size, and hence, maps are\nundersampled. The on-source integration time ranged from 120 to 360 seconds for each\nposition, and the rms noise temperature ranged from 0.14 to 0.25 K in the Tmb scale.\nIn addition, the J=2-1 lines of DNC and HN13 C were observed toward selected positions with the NRAO 12 m telescope3 at Kitt Peak in 1999 December. The beam sizes\nwere 40\u2032\u2032 and 35\u2032\u2032 (HPBW) for the DNC and HN13 C observations, respectively. We used\ntwo SIS mixer receivers and observed the DNC and HN13 C lines simultaneously. The\nsystem temperatures were typically 400-500 K (SSB), although those for the HN13 C lines\nwere systematically higher because of the heavier atmospheric absorption due to the water line (183 GHz). Since the temperature scale is given as TR\u2217 in the observations with\nthe NRAO 12 m telescope, we converted these values to the main beam brightness tem\u2217\nperature by the following equation; Tmb = TR\u2217 /\u03b7m\n. The corrected main beam efficiency\n\u2217\n(\u03b7m ) of the NRAO 12 m telescope was 0.7 for the DNC and HN13 C lines (J=2-1), which\nwas derived from observations of planets. The hybrid spectrometers with the frequency\nresolution of 48.8 kHz were used for the backend. The velocity resolutions were 0.096 km\ns\u22121 and 0.084 km s\u22121 in the 152 GHz and 174 GHz regions, respectively. We employed\nthe position-switching mode as in the observations with the NRO 45 m telescope. On\nsource integration time was from 20 to 70 minutes and the rms noise temperature was\nfrom 0.04 to 0.15 K in the Tmb scale.\n3\n\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) is a facility of the National Science Foundation,\noperated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n3.\n\nLine Parameter\n\nWe observed both the J=1-0 and 2-1 lines of DNC and HN13 C toward selected 10\npositions. The DNC lines were detected toward all the positions, while the J=1-0 and\n2-1 lines of HN13 C were detected toward 9 and 8 positions, respectively. Examples of\nthe observed spectra are shown in Figure 1. It is known that the DNC and HN13 C lines\nhave complex hyperfine structure due to the deuterium and nitrogen nuclei (Frerking,\nLanger, & Wilson 1979; Paper I; Turner 2001). Since the hyperfine splittings in the\nDNC and HN13 C lines were not resolved completely due to the small nuclear quadrupole\ncoupling constants, eQq (Paper I; Turner 2001), a single Gaussian profile was fitted to\neach spectrum to determine the peak antenna temperature, line width, and LSR velocity.\nResults are summarized in Table 3.\nAs shown in Table 3, broadening due to an unresolved hyperfine structure pattern\nis larger for the DNC lines than for the HN13 C lines, and is larger for the J=1-0 lines\nthan for the J=2-1 lines. In addition, the LSR velocities of the J=1-0 and 2-1 lines of\nDNC and HN13 C seem to be slightly different even toward the same position, which are\nalso due to the hyperfine structure of the lines. Therefore, the line parameters derived\nfrom the single Gaussian fitting do not exactly represent the velocity width of the core.\nAlthough it is, in principle, possible to determine the velocity width by the Gaussian\nfitting including hyperfine structure, it is almost impossible to do this because of the\nlimited spectral resolution of the spectrometers used in our observations. In practice,\nthe derived column densities are consistent with those derived by including the hyperfine\nsplittings, as shown in Paper I and Turner (2001). Thus, we analyzed our data using the\nresults of the single Gaussian fitting.\nWe found a double-peaked line profile in the H13 CO+ spectrum toward L1544, indicating that there are two velocity components in L1544 (Tafalla et al. 1998; Caselli et al.\n2002a). On the other hand, the DNC and HN13 C lines do not show apparent evidence for\ntwo velocity components or a self-absorption dip, indicating the difference in distributions\nbetween HCO+ and HNC; HNC resides in an inner part of the core while HCO+ tend to\nbe depleted at the core center.\n\n4.\n\nLVG Analysis\n\nWe analyzed the J=2-1 and 1-0 data of DNC and HN13 C by statistical equilibrium\ncalculations based on the large velocity gradient (LVG) model (Goldreich & Kwan 1974).\nWe simultaneously fitted the DNC and HN13 C data to derive the H2 density and the\ncolumn densities of DNC and HN13 C. Since the hyperfine structure was not resolved for\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nmost of the observed lines, we ignored the hyperfine splitting. Collisional excitation rates\nfor the DNC-H2 system and the HN13 C-H2 system were calculated from those of the HCNHe system (Green & Thaddeus 1974). We multiplied by a factor of 1.37 to the HCN-He\ncollision rates to correct the difference in the reduced mass. The dipole moment is 3.05\ndebye both for DNC and HN13 C (Blackman et al. 1976).\nThe mean FWHM line width of the J=2-1 and 1-0 lines was used to estimate the\nvelocity gradient in the LVG calculations. This assumption would affect the derived\ncolumn density, because the J=2-1 lines have systematically narrower line widths than\nthe J=1-0 lines due to a difference in the unresolved hyperfine structure. However, we\nconfirmed that the systematic errors in the column density caused by this assumption\nwould be less than 25%. The kinetic temperature was assumed to be 10 K for all the\ncores (Benson & Myers 1989). If we assume the kinetic temperature of 8-12 K, the\nderived column densities of DNC and HN13 C vary only 10-20 %, and hence, a change in\nthe DNC/HN13 C ratios is confirmed to be less than 20 %, while the H2 densities typically\nvary by a factor of 2.\nThe H2 densities and the column densities of DNC and HN13 C obtained by the above\nmethod are summarized in Table 4, and the derived DNC/HN13 C ratios are summarized\nin Table 5. In this analysis, we noticed that the intensities of the J=2-1 lines relative\nto the J=1-0 lines of DNC observed in TMC-1(cyanopolyyne peak, hereafter CP), L63(30\u2032\u2032 , 90\u2032\u2032 ), and L63(0\u2032\u2032 , 60\u2032\u2032 ) are slightly smaller than those allowed by the LVG model.\nThis is in part due to the limited signal-to-noise ratio of the data, but may also reflect a\nsystematic error such that the DNC lines are more affected by the beam dilution effect\nthan the HN13 C lines because of a systematically larger beam size for DNC. Therefore,\nwe assumed the H2 density derived from the HN13 C data in the analysis for TMC-1 (CP).\nSimilarly, we employed the H2 density derived from the DNC and HN13 C data toward the\n(0\u2032\u2032 , 0\u2032\u2032 ) position of L63 in the analysis for the other 2 positions in L63.\nFor comparison, we analyzed the DNC and HN13 C data individually. We found that\nthe H2 densities derived from the HN13 C data are larger by a factor of 1.3-4.5 than those\nfrom the DNC data. As a result, the DNC/HN13 C ratios systematically increased by a\nfactor of 1.2-2.6. The largest change in the DNC/HN13 C ratios were found for the (0\u2032\u2032 ,\n0\u2032\u2032 ) position of L63 and TMC-1 (core C), where the change in the DNC/HN13 C ratios are\nfactor of 2.6 and 2.4, respectively. Except for these two positions, the uncertainty in the\nDNC/HN13 C ratio due to the assumed H2 density is estimated to be less than a factor of\n1.6. In total, the typical uncertainty in the DNC/HN13 C ratio is estimated to be a factor\nof 2.\nThe H2 densities determined by the LVG analysis range from 1.4\u00d7105 cm\u22123 to\n5.5\u00d7105 cm\u22123 . These values indicate that the DNC and HN13 C molecules seem to be\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\ndistributed in similar density regions traced by DCO+ (Butner et al. 1995), C34 S (Hirota\net al. 1998), NH3 (Benson & Myers 1989), and N2 H+ (Caselli et al. 2002c). The density\nvariation is not very large among the observed positions. We compared our results with\nthose of Paper I, in which the H2 densities determined from the C34 S lines were used\n(Hirota et al. 1998). For three positions, TMC-1(CP), TMC-1(NH3 ), and L63 (0\u2032\u2032 , 0\u2032\u2032 ),\nwe found that the H2 densities derived from the DNC and HN13 C lines are comparable\nto those derived from the C34 S lines (Hirota et al. 1998). On the other hand, the H2\ndensity determined from the C34 S lines for L1544 (0\u2032\u2032 , 0\u2032\u2032 ) is lower by a factor of 5 than\nthat from the DNC and HN13 C lines. Since the (0\u2032\u2032 , 0\u2032\u2032 ) position of L1544 is not the core\ncenter but rather close to the edge, the H2 density derived from the C34 S data would be\nreduced. Nevertheless, the DNC/HN13 C ratios reported for these positions in Paper I are\ncomparable to those derived in the present study.\nThe derived DNC/HN13 C ratios range from 1.25 to 5.44. The DNC/HN13 C ratio\nfor TMC-1(CP), 1.25, agrees well with that of Turner (2001), 0.99-1.24. Assuming that\nthe 12 C/13 C ratio is 60 (Mangum et al. 1988; Langer & Penzias 1993; Ikeda, Hirota, &\nYamamoto 2002), the DNC/HNC ratios are derived to be 0.02-0.09. These values are\nconsistent with our previous estimates (Paper I).\n\n5.\n\nDistributions of DNC and HN13 C\n\nThe integrated intensity maps of DNC (J=1-0), HN13 C (J=1-0), and H13 CO+ (J=10) along with the integrated intensity ratio maps of DNC/HN13 C (J=1-0) are shown\nin Figures 2-5. As shown in Table 4, the optical depths of the J=1-0 lines of DNC\nand HN13 C are less than 1.7. Therefore, the integrated intensity distributions of the\nJ=1-0 lines approximately represent the column density distributions, and the integrated\nintensity ratio of DNC/HN13 C in the J=1-0 lines approximately represents the column\ndensity ratio of DNC/HN13 C. In fact, the integrated intensity ratios of DNC/HN13 C well\ncorrelate with the column density ratios, as shown in Table 5.\nIn general, the distributions of DNC and HN13 C resemble that of N2 H+ for L1512,\nL1544, and L63 (Caselli et al. 2002c). On the other hand, the distributions of H13 CO+ is\nmore extended than those of DNC and HN13 C. These differences would reflect the chemical\nabundance variation within the core. Although these molecular lines trace similar density\nregions (105 -106 cm\u22123 ), DNC and HN13 C reside in an inner part of the core as N2 H+ and\nNH3 (Bergin & Langer 1997; Caselli et al. 2002b).\nThe distributions of DNC and HN13 C are also quite similar to each other. As a\nresult, the variation of the integrated intensity ratio of DNC/HN13 C in each core is less\nthan a factor of 2. We should emphasize that the variation of the DNC/HN13 C ratios\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nfrom core to core, ranging from 0.50 to 7.3 (Paper I), is much larger than that within\neach core. Nevertheless, a small but systematic variation of the DNC/HN13 C ratios are\nfound in TMC-1 and L63. These cores are larger in size than L1512 and L1544, and have\nmultiple peak positions in the maps. First, we discuss these two cores.\n\n5.1.\n\nTMC-1 and L63\n\nTMC-1 is one of the most well studied dark cloud cores, and various molecular lines\nhave been detected with radio telescopes. The maps of the DNC, HN13 C, and H13 CO+\nlines in TMC-1 are shown in Figure 2. As suggested in Paper I, a gradient can be seen in\nthe DNC/HN13 C intensity ratio along the ridge; the DNC/HN13 C intensity ratio around\nthe ammonia peak in the northwest part of the ridge is systematically larger than that\naround the cyanopolyyne peak in the southeast part of the ridge. This is confirmed by our\nLVG analysis, as shown in Table 5. A similar trend can also be seen in other deuterated\nmolecules such as DCO+ (Gu\u00e9lin, Langer, & Wilson 1982; Saito et al. 2002), CH2 DCCH\n(Markwick, Millar, & Charnley 2002), DC3 N (Howe et al. 1994), and C3 HD (Bell et\nal. 1988). Although the H2 density is higher in the core C, the density gradient is not\nsignificant between the cyanoplyyne peak and the ammonia peak.\nAs mentioned in Section 1, it is well known that the abundances of carbon-chain\nmolecules show anti-correlation with those of NH3 , N2 H+ , and SO along the TMC-1\nridge (Hirahara et al. 1992; 1995). Thus, the DNC/HNC ratio well correlates with the\nNH3 /CCS ratio along the ridge. This correlation seems to be understood naturally in\nterms of chemical evolution; the southern part of the ridge is younger than the northern\npart (Paper I; Saito et al. 2002), although the other mechanism considering protostellar\nactivities in the northern region is also presented (Markwick, Millar, & Charnley 2000;\nMarkwick, Charnley, & Millar 2001)\nA gradient in the ratio is marginally seen in L63. L63 is one of the cores with the\nhighest deuterium fractionation in DNC (Paper I), DCO+ (Butner et al. 1995), and NH2 D\n(Saito et al. 2000). The maps of the DNC, HN13 C, and H13 CO+ lines in L63 are shown\nin Figure 5. There are a few emission peaks in each map, and their positions are slightly\ndifferent from one another. The overall distributions of DNC and HN13 C are similar to\nthat of N2 H+ (Caselli et al. 2002c). Millimeter and submillimeter continuum emissions\nwere also observed by Ward-Thompson et al. (1994, 1999) and they presented the maps\nin the 1.3 mm and 800 \u03bcm emissions, although they only observed the southern part of\nthe core. The DNC/HN13 C ratio is higher along the north-south ridge of the core and the\n(-30\u2032\u2032, 90\u2032\u2032 ) position, which corresponds to one of the H13 CO+ peak. Especially, the (-30\u2032\u2032,\n90\u2032\u2032 ) position is remarkable because the HN13 C line is only marginally detected. In this\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nposition, it is possible that the fractionation of DNC is as high as 0.1-0.2. However, the\nphysical and chemical conditions toward northern part of L63 are unclear in the present\nstage because of the lack of detailed observational data.\n\n5.2.\n\nL1512 and L1544\n\nThe maps of the DNC, HN13 C, and H13 CO+ lines in L1512 and L1544 are shown\nin Figures 3 and 4, respectively. In these cores, we cannot find apparent systematic\ngradients in the DNC/HN13 C ratio maps. Even when we obtained the column densities\nfor two representative positions, (0\u2032\u2032 , 0\u2032\u2032 ) and (20\u2032\u2032 , -60\u2032\u2032), in L1544 by the LVG analysis,\nthe DNC/HNC ratio is higher only by a factor of 1.5 toward the core center (20\u2032\u2032 , -60\u2032\u2032 )\nthan toward the edge (0\u2032\u2032 , 0\u2032\u2032 ). On the other hand, Caselli et al. (2002b) reported that\nthe DCO+ /HCO+ ratio in L1544 is enhanced almost by an order of magnitude from the\nedge to the center of the core. In addition, they also reported that the N2 D+ /N2 H+\nratio is enhanced at the core center although the gradient is smaller than that of the\nDCO+ /HCO+ ratio (Caselli et al. 2002b). Therefore, our result is a contrast to theirs.\nAs for L1512, no mapping observations of deuterated molecules has been reported as far\nas we know.\nIt has been reported that the CO molecule is significantly depleted in the central\npart of L1544 and L1512 (Caselli et al. 2002b; Lee et al. 2003). Particularly, Caselli et\nal. (2002b) presented a map of the depletion factor of CO in L1544, indicating that the\ndepletion factor increases at least by a factor of about 3 from the edge to the center of the\ncore. A heavier depletion of CO would make the life time of H2 D+ longer, resulting high\nH2 D+ /H+\n3 ratio (e.g. Roberts & Millar 2000; Turner 2001). Therefore, the DNC/HNC\nratio would also be enhanced through the deuteron transfer reaction from H2 D+ followed\nby the electron recombination reaction. However, the present results suggest that the\nDNC/HNC ratio is not very sensitive to the depletion factor unlike DCO+ /HCO+ and\nN2 D+ /N2 H+ ratios.\n\n6.\n\nOrigin of the Variation of the DNC/HNC Ratio\n\nAs discussed in Section 4, the DNC/HNC ratio is derived to be 0.02-0.09 for the\nobserved cores. These values are significantly higher than those predicted by pure gasphase chemical models in cold (10 K) dark cloud cores, ranging from 0.015 to 0.03 (Howe\n& Millar 1993; Roberts & Millar 2000; Turner 2001). Hence the model including the\neffect of depletion of molecules onto grain surface is invoked to explain the observed ratio.\nAccording to Turner (2001), the DNC/HNC ratio increases by a factor of 2-2.5, as the\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\ndepletion factor of C and O increases from 1 to 3. In order to confirm this effect further,\nwe have investigated the spatial distribution of the DNC/HNC ratio in the L1544 core,\nwhere a positive gradient of the depletion factor from the edge to the center of the core is\nreported (Caselli et al. 2002b). However, no significant enhancement in the DNC/HNC\nratio has been observed, although Caselli et al. (2002b) reported that the DCO+ /HCO+\nratio is much enhanced toward the center of the core.\nOne possibility for a lack of enhancement in the DNC/HNC ratio at the core center\nis a relatively small distribution of HNC. As noted in Section 5, the distribution of HNC\nis slightly smaller than that of HCO+ , which implies that DNC and HNC reside only in\nan inner part of the core than DCO+ and HCO+ . If so, a variation of the depletion factor\nin such a restricted part might be small, which results in a relatively small variation of\nthe DNC/HNC ratio. However, the large core-to-core variation of the DNC/HNC ratio\ncannot be explained in this way, unless the core-to-core variation of the depletion factor\nis introduced a priori.\nAnother possibility is related to the time scale of the deuterium fractionation. The\ntime scale for deuterium fractionation via the gas-phase reactions is roughly estimated to\nbe 105 yr for the H2 density of 105 cm\u22123 , according to the chemical model calculations\n(Turner 2001). This would mainly be determined by the mean collision time of a molecule\n5\nwith the H+\n3 ion. This time scale is comparable to the dynamical time scale (\u223c10 yr)\nand the depletion time scale (\u223c105 yr). Therefore, there is a possibility that deuterium\nfractionation does not follow the change in depletion in a dynamically evolving core. This\nmay be a reason why we observed no significant enhancement of the DNC/HNC ratio at\nthe center of the core. The time scale can, of course, be different from species to species.\nAccording to Turner (2001), the time dependence of deuterium fractionation strongly\ndepends on species. If the protonated species such as HCO+ and N2 H+ would have faster\ntime scale for the deuterium fractionation, the DCO+ /HCO+ ratio can be enhanced at\nthe center of the core, as observed by Caselli et al. (2002b).\nThe latter explanation can also account for the core-to-core variation of the DNC/HNC\nratio. If a core contracts very slowly in comparison with the dynamical time scale,\nmolecules are subject to heavy depletion. As a result, high deuterium fractionation would\nbe expected. In fact, Aikawa et al. (2001) constructed a chemical model for a dynamically\nevolving core, and showed that the DCO+ /HCO+ ratio would increase if the time scale of\ncollapse is relatively longer than those of gas-phase chemistry and depletion of molecules\nonto grain surface. Probably the L63 core corresponds to this case. If the core is in a\nvery early stage of collapse, deuterium fractionation has not well proceeded. Furthermore,\nmolecules have not been depleted onto dust grains yet, which also gives an unfavorable\ncondition for deuterium fractionation. Probably TMC-1 (CP) corresponds to this case,\nwhere the chemical age of the core seems to be young judging from the low NH3 /CCS\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nratio (Suzuki et al. 1992; Hirahara et al. 1992). In addition, the L1521E core also corresponds to this case, where an extremely low DNC/HNC ratio is reported (Hirota et al.\n2002). From these considerations, the observed variation of the DNC/HNC ratio seems to\noriginate from a combination of the three competing time-dependent processes; gas-phase\ndeuterium fractionation, depletion of molecules onto grain surface, and dynamical evolution of a core (e.g. Aikawa et al. 2001). Therefore, the DNC/HNC ratio becomes higher\nfor more chemically evolved cores, and shows a correlation with the NH3 /CCS ratio (Paper I). For quantitative discussions, systematic chemical model calculations of collapsing\ncores would be necessary. Such an effort has recently been carried out by Aikawa, Ohashi,\n& Herbst (2003).\n\n7.\n\nSummary\n\nIn this paper, we report the results of mapping observations of the J=1-0 lines of\nDNC, HN13 C, and H13 CO+ toward 4 nearby dark cloud cores; TMC-1, L1512, L1544, and\nL63. Along with the mapping observations, we have observed the J=2-1 lines of DNC\nand HN13 C toward selected positions, which enables us to determine the H2 densities\nof the emission regions and the column densities of DNC and HN13 C by the statistical\nequilibrium calculations based on the LVG model. The main results of this paper are as\nfollows:\n1. We calculated the column densities of DNC and HN13 C by the LVG calculations\nassuming that the DNC and HN13 C lines trace the same volume of gas. The\nDNC/HN13 C ratios range from 1.25 to 5.44, with a typical uncertainties of a factor\nof 2. The H2 densities ranges from 1.4\u00d7105 cm\u22123 to 5.5\u00d7105 cm\u22123 .\n2. Assuming the 12 C/13 C ratio of 60, the DNC/HNC ratios are estimated to be 0.020.09. Some of the observed DNC/HN13 C ratios exceed values predicted by gas-phase\nchemical models in cold (10 K) dark cloud cores, 0.015-0.03.\n3. The distributions of DNC and HN13 C resemble that of N2 H+ for L1512, L1544, and\nL63. On the other hand, the distributions of H13 CO+ is more extended than those\nof DNC and HN13 C. These difference would reflect chemical abundance variation\nwithin the core; DNC and HN13 C would reside in an inner part of the core as well\nas the other nitrogen-bearing molecules such as N2 H+ and NH3 while H13 CO+ in\nan outer envelope.\n4. The distributions of DNC and HN13 C are quite similar to each other, and the\nvariation of the DNC/HN13 C ratio within each core is less than a factor of 2. The\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nvariation of the DNC/HN13 C ratios from core to core, ranging an order of magnitude\n(0.50-7.3), is rather remarkable than those within each core.\n5. While the systematic variation of the DNC/HN13 C ratio can be seen in TMC-1\nand L63, a similar gradient cannot be found in L1512 and L1544. Particularly, the\nDNC/HNC ratio does not show enhancement at the center of the core of L1544\nunlike the DCO+ /HCO+ ratio. This indicates that the DNC/HNC ratio is not very\nsensitive to depletion factor. Since the time scale of gas-phase deuterium fractionation, depletion of molecules onto grain surface, and dynamical evolution of a cloud\ncore are comparable to one another, a combination of these competing processes\nwould be responsible for the variation of the DNC/HNC ratio. The DNC/HNC\nratio tends to be higher for more chemically evolved cores.\n\nWe are grateful to the staff of Nobeyama Radio Observatory and the NRAO 12 m\ntelescope for their assistance in observations.
