We will\npresent detailed studies of the approach guided by two many-body models.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe solution of large, sparse eigenvalue problems is an\nimportant task in engineering, mathematics, and physics,\nparticularly in the field of strongly correlated quantum\nmany-body systems, such as the high-TC superconductors, and more recently cold atoms on optical lattices and\ncoupled light-matter systems. The treatment of strong\ncorrelations between particles leads to exponentially large\neigenvalue problems as a function of the system size.\nTo begin with, algebraic eigensolvers like the Lanczos\nand Arnoldi methods [1, 2] play an important role in\nmany body-physics as well as in many other research areas, mainly due to the fact that they are widely applicable,\nsimple, effective and they yield numerically exact results.\nImplementations of the methods can be obtained from the\nInternet, e.g. the well-known ARPACK1 routine which includes an implicitly restarting Arnoldi algorithm. On the\ndownside, only comparably small systems can be treated\nby these techniques. For most problems in quantum manybody physics, the corresponding geometric sizes are much\ntoo small.\nA couple of sophisticated numerical methods have been\ndeveloped for such systems in recent years. The density\nmatrix renormalization group (DMRG) [3] is a powerful\nalgorithm for the determination of ground state properties\nof large systems, which are not algebraically feasible. Recently the approach has been embedded into a wider mathematical framework, the matrix product states (MPS, [4]).\nThe approach is limited to 1D or quasi-1D systems. Another method is the cluster perturbation theory (CPT, [5]),\nEmail address: ralf.gamillscheg@tugraz.at (Ralf\nGamillscheg)\n1 http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\nwhich constructs approximations to the Green's function\nof infinite systems in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions by exact treatment of small clusters and combining them by perturbation theory. An extension of CPT represents the variational cluster approach (VCA, [6]) which improves the results by introducing variational parameters. An approach\nwithout systematic errors is given by the family of quantum Monte-Carlo techniques (QMC, [7]). QMC simulations, which are based on high dimensional random samples of some suitable probability-density function have an\nstatistical error which declines with the sample size. They\nare applicable to fairly large systems and to finite temperatures. The drawback of these methods is the so-called\nsign-problem, that shows up especially in fermionic models and which makes certain models or parameter regimes\ninaccessible [8]. The methods discussed so far are particularly tailored for quantum many-body problems and\ncannot be applied easily, if at all, to matrices of other applications.\nThe methods for strongly correlated quantum manybody systems rely on the assumption that the model has\nonly a few rather local degrees of freedom. Real ab-initio\nmodels for strongly correlated quantum many-body systems are out of reach in any case, and it is inevitable to\nreduce the complexity of the system upon describing the\nkey physical properties by a few effective degrees of freedom, like in the multi band Hubbard model [9]. In many\ncases, these models are still too complicated and cannot\nbe solved reliably neither analytically nor numerically. For\nthese cases it has been proven very useful to construct\neffective Hamiltonians like the Heisenberg- or tJ-model.\nThey are obtained via the projection technique [9, 10]\nupon integrating out such basis vectors which correspond\nto high energy excitations, or rather which have very large\nOctober 31, 2018\n\n\fdiagonal matrix elements in a suitable basis. Of course,\nit is desirable that the quantitative results of the effective\nmodel are close to those of the original model. But more\nthan that, it is the qualitative generic physics of strongly\ncorrelated fermions at low energies, which one wants to understand. Since the original model itself is tailored for that\npurpose and is already a crude approximation of the underlying ab-initio Hamiltonian, it suffices to have an effective\nmodel that still includes the key physical ingredients in\norder to describe competing effects of strongly correlated\nquantum many-body systems. The standard projection\ntechnique defines the space of dynamical variables (basis\nvectors) which are of crucial importance for the low lying\neigenvalues, which are marked by small interaction energy\n(small diagonal matrix elements). The residual dynamical\nvariables (basis vectors) are treated in second order perturbation theory. If the model contains too complicated\nterms, such as the density assisted next-nearest neighbor\nhopping in the tJ-model, they are omitted. The resulting\nmodel has a significantly reduced configuration space and\nis solved by one of the above mentioned techniques.\nHere we present a numerical scheme, that represents a\nthreefold generalization of the projection technique: a) it\ncombines the two steps of the construction of the effective\nmodel and exact diagonalization, b) no approximations are\nmade as far as the effective model is concerned and c) it\nallows a systemic inclusion of higher order terms up to\nthe convergence to the exact result. The projection step is\nbased on the Schur complement and results in a non-linear\neigenvalue problem, which is solved exactly.\nThe numerical projection technique (NPT), that shall\nbe discussed in this paper, has several advantages. First\nof all, it is not necessary to formulate an explicit effective\nHamiltonian, which is not trivial in more complex models\ninvolving several bands and other degrees of freedom than\njust charge carriers [11]. And last but not least, NPT allows to systematically go to higher orders, which becomes\nnecessary if the coupling strength is merely moderate.\nNPT is applicable to other large scale eigenvalue problems as well. The underlying matrix has to be sparse and\nthe diagonal elements, after suitable spectral shift, have\nto fulfill the following criterion: a few diagonal elements\nare zero or small and the vast majority of the diagonal\nelements is (much) greater than the sum of the respective\noff-diagonal elements.\nThe method is demonstrated by application to two\nrepresentative problems of strongly-correlated quantum\nmany-body physics, the spinless fermion model with nearest neighbor repulsion and the drosophila of solid state\nphysicists: the Hubbard model with a local Coulomb repulsion. These models are used for benchmark purposes\nonly and it is not the goal of the present paper to provide\na detailed discussion of the fascinating physics described\nby these models.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In the second\nsection we present the two benchmark models. The numerical projection technique is introduced in detail in the\n\nthird section and analyzed in the ensuing sections.\n2. Model systems and basic idea\nThe approach that we present below is generally applicable if the matrix, for which the lowest eigenvalues shall\nbe determined, can be split into parts of increasing diagonal dominance. What this means in detail will be clarified\nusing two examples of the realm of many-body physics,\nthe spinless fermion model with strong nearest neighbor\ninteraction and the Hubbard model for fermions. Both\nmodels are tailored to study effects of strong correlations\nof electronic systems, such as the Mott-insulators [12], high\ntemperature superconductors [13], manganites [14], just to\nname a few of the very many novel materials with fascinating many-body effects. The Hamiltonian of the spinless\nfermion model reads\nX \u2020\nX\n\u0124 = \u2212t\n\u00e2i \u00e2j + V\nn\u0302i n\u0302j ,\nhiji\n\nhiji\n\nwhere \u00e2\u2020i (\u00e2i ) denotes the creation (annihilation) operator\nfor fermions at site i. These operators have the common\nfermionic anti-commutator relations (for details see [15]).\nThe operator n\u0302i = \u00e2\u2020i \u00e2i is the particle number operator for\nsite i. The bracket hiji indicates that the sum is restricted\nto nearest-neighbor sites xi and xj . There is a total of L\nlattice sites xi , which are placed on a simple cubic lattice\nin one dimension in the present work.\nIn the case of the Hubbard model, the spin degree of\nfreedom is also taken into account and the Hamiltonian\nreads\nX \u2020\nX\n\u0124 = \u2212t\n\u00e2i\u03c3 \u00e2j\u03c3 + U\nn\u0302i\u2191 n\u0302j\u2193 .\nhiji\u03c3\n\ni\n\nThe creation- (annihilation-) operators \u00e2\u2020i\u03c3 (\u00e2i\u03c3 ) obtain\na spin index \u03c3 with two possible orientations \u2191, \u2193. The\noperator n\u0302i\u03c3 = \u00e2\u2020i\u03c3 \u00e2i\u03c3 is the particle number operator for\nspin \u03c3 at site i and theP\noperator for the particle density at\nsite i is given by n\u0302i = \u03c3 n\u0302i\u03c3 .\nThe physical behavior of both models is determined by\nthe relative strength of the hopping parameter t and the\ntwo interaction parameters U , which stands for the onsite Coulomb repulsion between fermions of opposite spin,\nand V , which represents the repulsive nearest-neighbor interaction. In order to simplify the discussion we denote\nboth parameters by V . In both cases the most interesting\ncase is that of (almost) half-filling. That is, the number\nof particles in the system is half the maximum capacity,\nwhich is L in the spinless fermion model and 2L in the\nHubbard model. Both models are particularly interesting\nin the strong coupling case, i.e. for V > |t|.\nFor both models we use the occupation number basis in\nreal space in which the interaction part is diagonal and has\na value N\u03ba V , where N\u03ba is either the number of occupied\nnearest-neighbor sites (Nnn ) in case of the spinless fermion\nmodel, or the number of double-occupancies (Nd ) in case\n2\n\n\f3.1. Projection Step\nWe start out with a general projection based idea for\nsolving an eigenvalue problem of a 2 \u00d7 2 block matrix\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\nA E\nx1\nx1\nA0 x =\n=\n\u03bb\n.\n(1)\nx2\nx2\nE\u2020 B\nThe blocks correspond to some suitable partitions of the\nvector space under consideration. The sizes of the two\npartitions shall be denoted by p1 and p2 , respectively. It\nis not necessary that the two partitions cover the entire\nvector space of the original problem.\nWe assume that A and E are 'small' compared to B,\nsuch that the lowest eigenvalue of A0 is predominated by\nthe corresponding eigenvalue of A and the perturbation\ndue to E and B can be included perturbatively. In order to\nquantify this idea, we will map the influence of the second\npartition into the first partition by a Schur transformation,\nsimilar to the projection technique [9, 10]. I.e. we multiply\nEq. 1 from the left with the matrix\n\u0012\n\u0013\nI \u2212EB \u22121\n0\nI\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of the Hamilton matrix of a V-ordered occupation number basis. The blue parts contain the hopping terms inside\na partition and the potential on the diagonal and the green parts\ncontain the hopping terms between the partitions.\n\nof the Hubbard model. In strong coupling, states with\nincreasing values of N\u03ba are decreasingly important. In\nthe projection technique [9, 10] effective strong coupling\nmodels are derived, in which the configuration space is\nrestricted to the sector N\u03ba = 0, i.e. Nnn = 0 (Nd = 0) and\nthe influence of the higher sectors are taken into account\nup to second order in t/V . A prominent example is the\nthe spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model which is\nobtained in the half-filled case of the Hubbard model or\nthe tJ-model, which is the generalization away from halffilling. Already in the tJ-model terms are neglected which\nbelong to the same order in t/V and to the same Nd -sector.\nIn models with more bands and degrees of freedom, the\nderivation of an effective strong coupling model can be\nvery demanding, like e.g. in the spin-orbital model for the\nmanganites [11].\nIn this paper, we exploit this idea numerically and generalize it in such a way, that the influence of high sectors\nis taken into account recursively without the need of leaving terms out that in standard projection technique would\ncomplicate the resulting effective Hamiltonian. For obvious reasons we will refer to this approach as numerical\nprojection technique (NPT).\n\nresulting in\n\u0012\nS\nE\u2020\n\n0\nB\n\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\nx1\nI\n=\u03bb\nx2\n0\n\n\u2212EB \u22121\nI\n\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\nx1\n,\nx2\n\nwith S = A \u2212 EB \u22121 E \u2020 being the Schur-complement. The\nsecond line of the eigenvalue equation yields\nx2 = \u2212(B \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 E \u2020 x1 .\n\n(2)\n\nInserting x2 into the first line leads to\nS\u03bb x1 := (A \u2212 E(B \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 E \u2020 )x1 = \u03bbx1 .\n\n(3)\n\nNote that this equation is in principle exact, no approximations have been made so far. The original problem\n(Eq. 1) has thus been projected into the subspace of the\nfirst partition which is of smaller size, but at the prize\nof a non-linear eigenvalue problem. By the above procedure we obtain only those eigenvectors x = (x1 , x2 ) of the\n2 \u00d7 2 block matrix with non-vanishing x1 , i.e. those vectors which evolve perturbatively from those of A. There\nare additional eigenvectors of the form x = (0, x2 ), which\ncan, however, be omitted, since their eigenvalues are of\norder O(V ) instead of O(t).\n\n3. Numerical Projection Technique\n3.2. Solution of the non-linear eigenvalue problem\nIn order to exploit the NPT, we reorder the basis vectors\naccording to N\u03ba . The corresponding Hamiltonian matrix\nhas a natural block structure (see Fig. 1) corresponding\nto the sectors with N\u03ba = 0, 1, 2, . . ..\nNote, that the hopping of a particle can only change the\nnumber N\u03ba by one. Therefore, only neighboring sectors are\ncoupled and the matrix has a tridiagonal block-structure.\n\nIn the numerical projection technique, to be outlined\nbelow, the second partition will consist of a single sector.\nHence B will be the sub-matrix of the Hamiltonian corresponding to basis vectors of that particular sector and\nit will consist of a kinetic term and an interaction term,\nB = B\u0303 +BV , with BV = N\u03ba V I, where a I is a unit matrix.\nBy virtue of this structure and the fact that |V | \u001d |t|, the\n3\n\n\fnumerical solution of the non-linear problem can be simplified significantly. We can expand the inverse in powers\nof BV\u22121 or rather (BV \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 . The latter step is justified,\nsince the lowest eigenvalues are of order t plus corrections\nof order V \u22121 , hence BV \u2212\u03bb = O(V ). The expansion yields\n1\nB\u2212\u03bb\n\nThe derivative of S\u03bb (Eq. 3) with respect to \u03bb therefore\nreads\nS\u03bb0 = \u2212E(B \u2212 \u03bb)\u22122 E \u2020 ,\n(5)\nwhich, like Eq. 4, can be expressed in a Taylor expansion\nE 0 (\u03bb) = \u2212\n\n1\n=\nBV \u2212 \u03bb + B\u0303\n1\n1\nB\u0303 + . . .\n=\n\u2212\nBV \u2212 \u03bb (BV \u2212 \u03bb)2\n\u221e\nX\n1\n=\n(\u2212B\u0303)\u03bd ,\n\u03bd+1\n(B\n\u2212\n\u03bb)\nV\n\u03bd=0\n\nS\u03bb = A +\n\n(\u03bb \u2212 BV )\u2212(\u03bd+1) E B\u0303 \u03bd E \u2020 .\n\n3.3. Iterative inclusion of higher sectors\nNow we are in the position to describe the numerical\nprojection technique. To begin with, we consider the following two partitions: the first partition may contain the\nlowest sectors N\u03ba = 0, 1, . . . , N 0 . The second partition\nconsists of merely one sector, namely N\u03ba = N 0 + 1. The\nsizes of the partitions are p1 and p2 , respectively. The\nprojection step, discussed before, is used to combine the\ntwo partitions. This step can now be invoked repeatedly\nin order to include increasingly higher sectors.\n\n(4)\n\nNote that the expressions (\u03bb \u2212 BV )\u2212(\u03bd+1) are only numbers. For an iterative solution of the non-linear eigenvalue\nproblem, S\u03bb has to be computed repeatedly for different\nvalues of \u03bb, but only the pre-factors (\u03bb \u2212 BV )\u2212(\u03bd+1) are\nmodified. The matrices E B\u0303 \u03bd E \u2020 , however, are independent\nof \u03bb. Therefore, they can be calculated once and stored,\nsince they are in general of moderate size, as will be discussed later on.\nThis expansion can also be used in Eq. 2 in order to\nevaluate the second part of the eigenvector, i.e.\nx2 = \u2212(B \u2212 \u03bb)\n\n\u2020\n\nE =\u2212\n\n\u221e\nX\n\na) We begin with the first partition, solve the eigenvalue\nproblem for A1 and determine the corresponding unitary matrix V1 containing the corresponding p1 eigenvectors.\nb) The matrix for the first two partitions has the following block structure\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA1 E1\nA2 =\n.\n\u2020\nE1 B1\n\n(\u03bb \u2212 BV )\u2212(\u03bd+1) B\u0303 \u03bd E \u2020 .\n\nc) Next we perform a unitary transformation on A2 provided by the unitary matrix diag(V1 , I) resulting in\n\u0012\n\u0013\nD1\nV1\u2020 E1\n\u00c32 :=\n(7)\nE1\u2020 V1\nB1\n\n\u03bd=0\n\nThe non-linear eigenvalue problem can now be solved\niteratively, by using an initial approximation for \u03bb to build\nS\u03bb , then solve the eigenvalue problem by suitable means\nand use the resulting eigenvalue as a new approximation\nfor \u03bb. Let x\u03bb be the normalized eigenvector of S\u03bb to the\nlowest eigenvalue E(\u03bb). In the next recursion \u03bb(new) =\nE(\u03bb) is used as new value for the parameter \u03bb.\nA more sophisticated approach to obtain an improved\nvalue for \u03bb is provided by the Newton-Raphson method.\nWe are actually seeking the roots of \u03a6(\u03bb) = E(\u03bb) \u2212 \u03bb. The\nNewton-Raphson approach yields\n\u03bb(new) = \u03bb \u2212\n\nwith D1 := V1\u2020 A1 V1 being a p1 -dimensional diagonal\nmatrix.\nd) Now we solve the eigenvalue problem for\n\u00c32 \u1e7c2 = \u1e7c2 D2 as outlined in the previous section and construct the eigenvector matrix for the\nentire matrix A2 :\n\u0012\n\u0013\nV1\nV2 =\n\u1e7c2 ,\nI\n\n1\nE 0 (\u03bb)\n\u03a6(\u03bb)\n=\n\u2212\nE(\u03bb)\n+\n\u03bb.\n\u03a60 (\u03bb)\nE 0 (\u03bb) \u2212 1\nE 0 (\u03bb) \u2212 1\n\nwith I being a identity matrix of appropriate size. As\ndiscussed before \u1e7c2 only contains the lowest p1 eigenvectors. Consequently, D2 is again a p1 -dimensional\ndiagonal matrix.\ne) Finally we include the blocks E2 and B2 of the next\nsector and perform again a unitary transformation\nwith diag(V2 , I) as in Eq. 7 leading to\n\u0012\n\u0013\nD2\nV2\u2020 E2\n\u00c33 =\n.\nE2\u2020 V2\nB2\n\nThe expression shows that this can be transformed to an\nequation of form \u03bb(new) = \u03b1E(\u03bb) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u03bb with\n\u03b1=\u2212\n\n(6)\n\nAs before, the stored matrices E B\u0303 \u03bd E \u2020 can be reused.\n\n\u03bd=0\n\n\u22121\n\n(\u03bd + 1)(\u03bb \u2212 BV )\u2212(\u03bd+2) x\u2020\u03bb E B\u0303 \u03bd E \u2020 x\u03bb .\n\n\u03bd=0\n\nand the calculation of S\u03bb becomes\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n1\n.\nE 0 (\u03bb) \u2212 1\n\nNote that in the simple iteration scheme \u03b1 = 1. In order to\ncalculate E 0 (\u03bb) we can use the Hellmann-Feynman theorem\nresulting in\n\nThe recursion steps (d) and (e) are continued until the\ndesired accuracy is reached.\n\nE 0 (\u03bb) = x\u2020\u03bb S\u03bb0 x\u03bb .\n4\n\n\f\u2192\n\n\u2192\n\n...\n\nFigure 2: Truncation procedure for the scheme presented in the text.\nEach partition is consecutively projected onto the original effective\nmatrix and diagonalized.\n\n3.4. Truncation of the first partition\nThe advantage of the numerical projection technique so\nfar is the fact that (non-linear) eigenvalue problems have to\nbe solved for matrices of a size given by the first partition\np1 , which is obviously smaller then the original size.\nIt may happen that the first partition, even if it covers\nmerely the first sector, is still very large. This is the case\nin the Hubbard model, where\nalready\nthe lowest sector for\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2191\n, which at half-filling beN\u03ba = 0 yields p1 = NL\u2191 L\u2212N\nN\u2193\n\u0001\nL\ncomes p1 = L/2\n. Next we will try and reduce the size\nof the first partition. Firstly, we can exploit translational\ninvariance and solve the eigenvalue problem in the individual k-space sectors. We can furthermore restrict the number of vectors, which are retained in the first partition,\nbased on some suitable criterion as to there importance\nfor the lowest eigenvalue. We will use only the most obvious and simple criterion, namely to keep those vectors,\nwhich belong to the lowest eigenvalues D2 of A1 . More\nsophisticated criteria as in DMRG are also conceivable.\nWe will use a predefined value p\u03031 \u2264 p1 for the truncation size of the first partition. That means, we solve the\neigenvalue problem of A1 of size p1 \u00d7 p1 and retain only\nthose p\u03031 eigenvectors in V1 which correspond to the lowest eigenvalues. According to the recursion procedure, in\nthe following recursion steps the diagonal matrices entering the left-upper block Dn will all have the size p\u03031 and\nhenceforth only (non-linear) eigenvalue problems of this\nsize occur.\n\nL\n\nM\n\ntNPT [s]\n\n16\n18\n20\n22\n24\n\n12870\n48620\n184756\n705432\n2704156\n\n0.0\n0.0\n0.1\n0.3\n0.6\n\ntAR [s]\n\nENPT\n\nENPT \u2212E0\nE0\n\n0.2\n0.8\n4.1\n10.4\n87.1\n\n-1.57\n-1.76\n-1.95\n-2.14\n-2.33\n\n0.007\n0.010\n0.012\n0.014\n0.014\n\nTable 1: Run-time and accuracy comparison between NPT (tNPT ,\nENPT ) and traditional Arnoldi eigensolver (ARPACK, tAR , E0 ) for\nthe spinless fermion model (|V /t| = 10) at half-filling for different\nsystem sizes and pbc. The recursion was stopped at an absolute\naccuracy of 10\u22124 . The matrices have size M \u00d7 M . All computations\nin this paper have been performed on a computer with Intel Core 2\nDuo 3GHz, 2GB RAM.\n\nTab. 1 exhibits a comparison of the run time for various\nsystem sizes. It can be seen that NPT is significantly faster\nthan the highly optimized ARPACK routine (Arnoldi implementation) for increasing system size. We observe that\neven for 106 \u00d7 106 -matrices the CPU time is less than 1\nsec. and more than a hundred times faster than the highly\noptimized ARPACK code.\n4.1. Dependence on the size of the initial partition\nIn Fig. 3 the upper curve (green squares) corresponds to\nthe case that the initial partition consists of the first sector\n(N\u03ba = 0) only, with p\u03031 = p1 = 2 and shows the dependence of the lowest eigenvalue on the maximum number of\nsectors, specified by N\u03bamax , included in the recursion. We\nobserve that the recursion rapidly levels off at a moderate\nrelative accuracy of 1 percent. The reason is due to the\nfact, that the vectors that are omitted during the recursion\nprocedure, are relevant for a higher accuracy.\nOne way to increase the accuracy is to choose a greater\ninitial partition upon including all sectors up to N\u03baini , but\nstill using a truncation size of the first partition p\u03031 = 2.\nThe results are also depicted in Fig. 3. The turquoise\nupward triangles, e.g., depict the results for N\u03baini = 2, i.e.\nthe initial partition contains sectors up to N\u03ba = 2 and\nthe subsequent recursions mix in N\u03ba = 3, . . . , N\u03bamax . The\nrelative accuracy increases by one order of magnitude but\nis still restricted. In all curves we observe that the result\nis converged when two more sectors are included beyond\nthe ones present in the initial partition, which is obviously\na consequence of the small truncation size p\u03031 = 2. The\nblue solid line indicates the result of the lowest eigenvalue\nobtained in the subspace spanned by the vectors of the\nsectors N\u03ba = 0, . . . , N\u03bamax .\n\n4. Numerical experiments\nWe begin with the spinless fermion model with periodic\nboundary condition (pbc) at half-filling. Due to the conservation of the total momentum k only those basis vectors\nwith the same k need to be taken into account. For the\nspinless fermion model at half-filling the ground state is\ndegenerate and has k = \u00b1 \u03c02 . We will therefore only take\nbasis vectors into account, that have a total momentum\nk = \u00b1 \u03c02 .2 The selection of the total momentum leads to a\nsignificant reduction of the computational effort. On the\none hand, the size p1 of the initial partition is reduced\nroughly by L and on the other hand it can be avoided\n2 We\n\nthat in the truncation step vectors are retained, that are\nirrelevant for the ground state of the original system.\nTo begin with, we choose as first partition the first sector with N\u03ba = 0, which consists of merely 2 states with\nparticles on every other site (charge density wave), i.e.\np\u03031 = p1 = 2. These two vectors are the real valued linear\ncombinations of the \u00b1 \u03c02 basis vectors.\n\nkeep both, to allow real valued matrices and eigenvectors.\n\n5\n\n\f5. Three-partition Projection\nAs discussed in the introduction, the central goal of the\nprojection techniques is to describe the low-lying generic\nphysics of the original quantum many-body system. We\nhave seen, that NPT as opposed to standard projection\ntechniques resulting in effective models, even yields quantitatively good agreement with the result of the the original model. If still higher accuracy is the ultimate goal,\nthen one can do even better then what has been discussed\nso far. It is possible to include in each recursion step two\nsectors at a time with little more CPU effort. To this end\nwe consider a matrix which has 3 \u00d7 3 tridiagonal block\nstructure, that results, if we add in each recursion (projection) step two additional sectors to the first partition.\nThe matrix has the structure\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nA E 0\n\uf8edE \u2020 B F \uf8f8 .\n0 F\u2020 C\n\nFigure 3: Convergence of the lowest eigenvalue with the largest sector\n(N\u03bamax ) included in the recursion, depending on the initial partition.\nIn all cases, p\u03031 = 2 was used, i.e. the 2 lowest eigenvectors of the\ninitial partition where kept. The blue solid line indicates the exact\nvalues corresponding the various subspaces (see text). The results\nare compared with the exact eigenvalue E0 of the original matrix on\na logarithmic scale. System parameters are L = 20, N = 10, |V /t| =\n10.\n\n4.2. Dependence on the truncation size\nSo far we have seen that the accuracy is limited when\nthe truncation size is restricted to 2, even if the size of the\ninitial partition is increased and all sectors are iteratively\nincluded. One is therefore driven to study the dependence\non the truncation size. To this end we consider one particular system (L = 20, N = 10, |V /t| = 10) and choose as\ninitial partition the lowest two sectors with N\u03ba = 0 and\nN\u03ba = 1. The size of the initial partition is p1 = 182. In\nTab. 2 the energies are listed for different truncation sizes\np\u03031 . In all cases NPT is iterated until an absolute accuracy\nof \u000f\u03bb = 10\u22124 is reached. We observe a clear improvement\nas compared to the case p\u03031 = 2, although the accuracy is\ncertainly limited by the fact, that only the first two sectors\nare included in the initial partition. We find that the accuracy achieved by using three sectors can never be reached.\n\np\u03031\n2\n4\n6\n10\n14\n16\n3 sectors\nexact\n\nENPT\n\nENPT \u2212E0\nE0\n\n-1.9565\n-1.9573\n-1.9594\n-1.9629\n-1.9713\n-1.9749\n-1.9793\n-1.9800\n\n0.012\n0.011\n0.010\n0.008\n0.004\n0.003\n0.001\n\nFigure 4: Comparison of the 2-partition and 3-partition approach\nfor two different system sizes.

The standard projection technique corresponds to an approximate evaluation of second order perturbation theory in the inverse\ninteraction parameter.\nNPT on the one hand a systematic application of the\nprojection techniques to any many-body Hamiltonian, irrespective of the complexity of the original model, also in\ncases where the analytic approach would lead to unmanageable effective models. On the other hand it is also applicable for moderate coupling parameters, where second\norder perturbation theory is not reliable enough.\nWe have demonstrated that NPT yields fairly accurate\nresults with little CPU-effort as compared to state-of-theart exact diagonalization. Furthermore, by solving the\nnon-linear eigenvalue problem and including higher order\nterms the approach yields significantly better results than\ntraditional projection technique.\n\n\u00d7\n\nE(\u2212B\u0303)\u03bd F (\u2212C\u0303)\u03c1 F \u2020 (\u2212B\u0303)\u03bc E \u2020 .
