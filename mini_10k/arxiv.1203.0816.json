In lieu of an explicit H2 flow, hydrogen\nspecies are produced during methane decomposition process into their active species\n(CHx<4), assisted by the plasma. Notably, the early stage of growth depends strongly on\nthe plasma power. The resulting grain size (the nucleation density) has a maximum\n(minimum) at 50 W and saturates when the plasma power is higher than 120 W because\nhydrogen partial pressures are effectively tuned by a simple control of the plasma power.\nRaman spectroscopy and transport measurements show that decomposed methane alone\ncan provide sufficient amount of hydrogen species for high-quality graphene synthesis by\nPECVD.\n\n2\n\n\fGraphene is a two-dimensional carbon material that has been attracting a great interest\nbecause of its unique electrical properties and high potential for applications.1-4 Singlelayer graphene has been made by a number of methods, including mechanical\nexfoliation,5 epitaxial growth on silicon carbide (SiC) at high temperature,6,\n\n7\n\nand\n\nchemical vapor deposition on catalytic metal substrates.8-12 The most common way of\nproducing single layer graphene is mechanical exfoliation from highly oriented pyrolytic\ngraphite (HOPG).5 Although the quality of exfoliated graphene is better than others, the\ndimension of graphene is limited to tens of microns. On the other hand, large-area\ngraphene can be grown epitaxially on single crystalline silicon carbide (SiC) by thermal\ndesorption of Si at the surface.\n\nDue to the strong interaction at the graphene/SiC\n\ninterface, however, the properties of graphene are changed, resulting in band-gap opening\nat Dirac point.13 Also, non-uniformity at step edges and high growth temperature (>\n1300 \u00b0C) limit the application of graphene produced by this method.\nThe chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is the most promising approach for\nproducing graphene for large-scale electronic device applications because of its\ncomparative low cost and high efficiency. As the quality of CVD-grown graphene\nstrongly depends on the growth conditions, the underlying growth mechanism of CVD\ngraphene has been studied intensively.14, 15 One of the notable findings is the prominent\nrole of hydrogen in the graphene synthesis revealed by Vlassiouk et al.14 The hydrogen\nappears to be indispensable as a co-catalyst of the metal in graphene synthesis and as an\netching reagent that controls the size and shape of domains. While Gao et al. reported the\nsynthesis of graphene on Cu foil in the absence of H2 flow by using extremely elevated\n\n3\n\n\fmethane concentrations,\n\n16\n\nthe growth is not self-limited to single-layer graphene in this\n\ncase.\nIn contrast, it was recently reported that plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD) could\nproduce single-layer graphene without H2 flow and the quality of graphene was high\nenough for innovative device applications such as barristor.17-19 However, the details of\ngrowth kinetics are still unknown, and the study on the role of plasma is timely. Here, we\npresent how the plasma affects the nucleation and subsequent growth in the absence of H2\nflow. It is found that the plasma plays an important role in the graphene growth by\ngenerating hydrogen species during the decomposition process of methane into active\nspecies. The amount of hydrogen species increases with the plasma power, resulting in a\ndrastic change of grain size. These behaviors are well explained by the dual role of\nhydrogen in the graphene growth. When the plasma power is high enough, good-quality\ngraphene with the carrier mobility of ~3,200 cm2V-1s-1 can be produced at 830 \u00b0C by\nusing methane as both carbon and hydrogen sources.\nThe graphene films studied in this work were grown on 25 \u03bcm-thick Cu foils (Alfa\nAesar, 99.8 %, #13382) by PECVD. The chamber is equipped with an inductively\ncoupled plasma reactor (a schematic diagram of the system is shown in the ESI). The RF\ncoil, having a diameter of ~25 cm, is located 35 cm above the top surface of the graphite\nsubstrate holder. In this geometry, the heating effect of substrate by plasma was\nnegligible (see ESI). A residual gas analyzer (RGA 100, Stanford Research System) is\nattached at the side wall of chamber to investigate the density of discharged species. A\ndifferential pumping technique is employed to meet the required working pressure of\nRGA (detailed information can be found in the ESI). The system is pumped with a\n\n4\n\n\fturbomolecular pump (Osaka Vacuum LTD, TG1003), keeping the base pressure as low\nas ~10-7 Torr. Polycrystalline Cu foil was cut into 7x7 cm2 pieces and mounted in the\nchamber without any pre-cleaning treatment. Five different stages were employed to\nsynthesize graphene films on Cu foil using methane (CH4) as a carbon source. The Cu\nsubstrate was heated to the growth temperature (700 ~ 830 \u00b0C) at the heating rate of\n3 \u00b0C/s. When it reached the target temperature, H2 gas was introduced into the chamber\nat the flow rate of 40 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm). Hydrogen gas was\ndischarged by an RF power of 50 W for 2 minutes to eliminate surface oxides on the\ncopper foil. Then, the chamber was purged with Ar at the flow rate of 100 sccm for 2\nminutes to remove residual hydrogen gas. During the graphene growth stage, radiofrequency (RF) plasma was generated for a specified growth time under a continuous\nflow of argon (or hydrogen, 40 sccm) and methane (1 sccm), while the pressure was kept\nat 10 mTorr. The plasma power was varied from 10 to 200 W and the growth time from\n0.2 to 4 minutes.\n\nSubsequently, the sample was cooled down rapidly to room\n\ntemperature at a cooling rate of 3 \u00b0C/s by turning off the heating power, and then it was\ntaken out for characterization.\nAll the synthesized graphene films were transferred onto SiO2/Si substrates by etching\nthe Cu foil in an aqueous solution of iron chloride (FeCl3).8 Prior to wet-etching, the\nsurface of graphene/Cu was spin-coated with poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA: 950\nA2), followed by baking at 150 \u00b0C for 3 minutes. The purpose of the PMMA coating is\nto protect graphene films from cracks and tears during the transfer process.9, 12 When Cu\nfoil was dissolved completely, the PMMA/graphene membrane was washed with\n\n5\n\n\fdeionized water and placed on the SiO2/Si substrate. Finally the PMMA film was\ndissolved and removed by acetone.\nThe surface morphologies of graphene films on Cu substrates are analyzed by scanning\nelectron microscope (SEM: Tescan, VEGA-3) and optical microscopy (Leica,\nDM2500M). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) studies were\nconducted by JEOL JEM-2100F. The crystallinity and the structural information of\nsynthesized graphene are obtained by micro-Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw, inVia\nsystem) using a 514.5 nm laser. In order to estimate the uniformity of synthesized\ngraphene, Raman spectra are measured at three different points in each graphene film.\nThe averaged data of these points are presented in the plots of intensity ratios and the full\nwidth at half maximum (FWHM). The point-to-point variation of the Raman spectra is\ndisplayed as an error-bar. A minimal laser power of 0.75 mW is used carefully during\nthe measurements to avoid any damage or heating of the graphene films. Electrical\nproperties were measured using the two-probe method.\nMethane (CH4) provides hydrogen species during its dissociation process into active\nspecies. In thermal CVD, only ~0.0002 % of incoming methane dissociates to active\nspecies in the gas phase at a temperature of 900 \u00b0C.20 In PECVD, however, more than\n80 % of methane dissociates to other species such as H, H2, CH3, CH2, C2H4, etc. due to\nthe advantage of inductively coupled plasma (ICP).20-23\n\nThe density of discharged\n\nspecies measured by RGA is shown in Fig. 1a. By controlling the plasma power, the\ndensity of hydrogen species (H2, H) is tuned effectively; it increases with plasma power\nand saturates when the plasma power is higher than 100 W (Fig. 1b). Considering the\nrole of hydrogen in graphene growth, it is expected that the early stage of graphene\n\n6\n\n\fgrowth will be affected by the hydrogen density. Fig. 2a-c shows SEM images of\ngraphene grains synthesized at plasma powers of 10, 50, and 170 W in Ar/CH4 mixtures.\nThe average grain size is ~0.4 \u03bcm when the plasma power is 10 W, but it sharply\nincreases to ~3 \u03bcm when the plasma power is increased to 50 W. It also sharply\ndecreased to ~0.8 \u03bcm at a plasma power of 170 W. The plots of the grain size and the\nnucleation density as a function of plasma power in Fig. 2e show that the grain size (the\nnucleation density) has a maximum (minimum) at 50 W and saturates to ~0.8 \u03bcm (~1.8\n\u03bcm-2) when the plasma power is higher than 120 W. This result is due to the increased\namount of hydrogen species at higher plasma power. It is well known that the hydrogen\nstrongly affects the resulting grain size because of its dual role in graphene synthesis; an\nactivator of CHx radicals into more active species (CHx + H \u2194 CHx-1 + H2) and an\netching reagent of graphene (H + graphene \u2194 (graphene - C) + CHx).14 These two\nprocesses compete and affect the growth of graphene depending on the partial pressure of\nhydrogen. The increase of grain size at low plasma power (10\u201350 W) is due to the cocatalytic role of hydrogen in graphene growth. On the other hand, the reduced grain size\nat higher plasma power (> 50 W) can be attributed to the etching effect of the graphene\nby hydrogen. As a control experiment with H2 flow, we synthesized graphene with\nH2/CH4 mixtures to compare the resulting grain sizes under various plasma powers. A\nSEM image of the graphene grains synthesized at plasma power of 50 W is shown in Fig.\n2d. The resulting grain size and nucleation density is plotted in Fig. 2f as a function of\nplasma powers from 20 to 200 W. Interestingly, unlike the graphene synthesis in Ar/CH4\nmixtures, the grain size and nucleation density of graphene is not affected by plasma\npower in H2/CH4 mixtures which show ~0.9 \u03bcm and ~1.7 \u03bcm-2, respectively. This\n\n7\n\n\fobservation implies that enormous amount of hydrogen lead to saturated grain size and\nnucleation density even at low plasma power. Note that these saturation behaviors are\nidentical to those of graphene synthesized with Ar/CH4 mixtures at higher plasma power\n(> 120 W), indicating that methane provides sufficient amount of hydrogen species in\nAr/CH4 mixtures by the assistance of plasma.\nSuch plasma power dependent behaviors are also seen in the time required for a full\ncoverage. As the growth time increases, graphene grains continue to grow laterally and\ncoalesce into larger ones, resulting in a fully covering monolayer of graphene on the Cu\nsurface. Fig. 3a shows the SEM image of a continuous graphene film grown under\nAr/CH4 condition having wrinkles and non-uniform dark flakes similar to those in thermal\nCVD-grown graphene.9,\n\n10\n\nMonolayer graphene is identified by high-resolution TEM\n\nmeasurement on the folded edges of the film (Fig. 3b). When the plasma power is 50 W,\n\nthe Cu surface is fully covered by graphene in 3 minutes in Ar/CH4 condition and in 1\nminute in H2/CH4 condition as shown in Fig. 3c. When the plasma power is increased to\n170 W, the full coverage time reduces to 2 minutes in Ar/CH4 condition while no\ndifference is observed in H2/CH4 condition at a plasma power of 150 W. To discuss in\ndetail, we define the coverage rate (vcov) and the area growth rate per grain (vgrain) as the\nincrease of graphene coverage and the increase of individual grain area within unit time t,\nrespectively. Since the vcov is related to the vgrain and the nucleation density (ng) as vcov =\nng \u00d7 vgrain,24 we extracted vgrain from the results of graphene coverage and nucleation\ndensity. Fig. 3d shows the vgrain as a function of surface coverage under various plasma\npowers and gas mixtures. Overall, the vgrain decreased when the surface coverage of\ngraphene increased because of the decreased area of the exposed Cu surface which act as\na catalyst for the synthesis of graphene.24 In Ar/CH4 mixtures, the vgrain decreased with\n8\n\n\fplasma power and became comparable to that of graphene grown with H2/CH4 mixtures,\nindicating that the increased amount of hydrogen species reduces vgrain because they etch\nthe graphene. Considering the reduced vgrain at higher plasma power, the coverage rate\n(vcov) of graphene on Cu is expected to decrease.\n\nHowever, as the plasma power\n\nincreased from 50 to 170 W, the vcov increased (Fig. 3c) because the ng increased to ten\ntimes (Fig. 2e) while the vgrain reduced to one-third (Fig. 3d).\nWe further investigated the Raman spectra of graphene synthesized under various\nplasma powers as shown in Fig. 4a. The three most prominent peaks are the D peak at\n~1350 cm-1, the G peak at ~1580 cm-1, and the 2D peak at ~2680 cm-1. The D peak is a\ndefect-induced Raman feature observed in the disordered sample or at the edge of the\ngraphene.25-28 The G peak is known to be associated with the doubly degenerate phonon\nmode at the Brillouin zone center, indicating sp2 carbon networks in the sample.25-28 The\nlow intensity ratio of the D peak to the G peak (ID/IG) in Fig. 4b indicates a low defect\ndensity in synthesized graphene, but slightly increased ID/IG at a plasma power of 170 W\nimplies that some structural defects are induced when the plasma power is too high. The\n2D peak, which originates from a second-order Raman process, is widely used to\ndetermine the thickness of graphene.25-28 For single-layer graphene, it is well-known that\nthe intensity ratio of the 2D peak to the G peak (I2D/IG) is higher than 2, and the FWHM\nof the 2D band is close to 30 cm-1.9,\n\n25, 27-30\n\nIn our samples synthesized in Ar/CH4\n\nmixtures, the ratio of I2D/IG and the FWHM of the 2D band are 2.1 and 43 cm-1,\nrespectively, when the plasma power is 10 W. But they are highly enhanced to ~3.8 and\n~31 cm-1 when the plasma power is higher than 30 W (Fig. 4b, c). This enhanced Raman\nspectra of graphene synthesized at higher plasma power supports that decomposed\n\n9\n\n\fmethane alone can provide sufficient amount of hydrogen species for high-quality\ngraphene synthesis by PECVD. Note that these Raman spectra are close to those of\ngraphene synthesized in H2/CH4 condition (I2D/IG ~3.8, FWHM ~29 cm-1).\nThe electrical property of synthesized graphene is evaluated by transport measurement.\nGraphene films were transferred onto SiO2/Si substrate and fabricated into back\u2013gated\ntransistors by e-beam lithography and O2 plasma etching. The optical image of the\ndevice is shown in the inset of Fig. 5. The channel width is 3 \u03bcm and the channel lengths\nare varied from 8 to 50 \u03bcm. The electrical resistances of graphene are measured at room\ntemperature by using low-frequency (~17 Hz) lock-in technique. The back gate voltage\nof \u00b130 V is applied through the highly doped Si substrate using 300 nm-thick SiO2 layer\nas the gate dielectric. The dependence of sheet conductance on the applied gate voltages\nis shown in Fig. 5. The shifted charge neutral Dirac point (VDirac) at ~2 V indicates that\nthere are some extrinsic hole-doping in the graphene film, most likely by residues from\netching solutions or PMMA. The carrier mobilities (\u03bc) were extracted by assuming a\nsimple Drude model, \u03bc = (ne\u03c1)-1, where n is the carrier density, e is the electric charge\nand \u03c1 is the resistivity.31 The tunable carrier density (n) corresponds to induced charges\nby the gate voltage, n = Cg(Vgate - VDirac)/e, where Cg is the gate capacitance of 115 aF\u03bcm2\n\nobtained from geometrical considerations.31 For this sample, we calculated an electron\n\nmobility of ~3,200 cm2V-1s-1 at n = -1\u00d71012 cm-2. When it was measured from multiple\ndevices, there were no specific dependence on the channel length (L = 8\u201350 \u03bcm) or the\nnumber of grain boundaries crossed. The mobility of graphene could be affected not only\nby the grain boundaries which act as scattering centers32 but also by other scattering\ndefects that may arise from the transfer and the fabrication processes.24, 32 Also, the\n\n10\n\n\flargest grain size does not guarantee the largest mobility.33 For comparison, we prepared\na single-domain graphene device with mechanically exfoliated graphene from highly\nordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and measured its transport properties (the gate\nvoltages dependence of sheet conductance is shown in ESI). The mobility of singledomain graphene with a channel length of 1 \u03bcm was found to be ~3,640 cm2V-1s-1, which\nwas comparable to that of our CVD graphene having multiple grain boundaries in the\nchannel. These results suggest that, at least in our works, extra defects other than grain\nboundaries are more dominant scattering centers limiting the mobility.\nThe effect of substrate temperature on graphene synthesis in Ar/CH4 condition is\ninvestigated in a temperature range from 700 to 830 \u00b0C while the plasma power and the\nsynthesis time were maintained at 50 W and 3 minutes, respectively. Fig. 6a shows\nRaman spectra of graphene film grown at different substrate temperatures.\n\nAs the\n\ntemperature decreases, the ratio of ID/IG increases from 0.2 to 0.7 and I2D/IG decreases\nfrom 4.0 to 2.2 (Fig. 6b). The higher intensity of the D peak and the broader FWHM of\nthe 2D band (Fig. 6c) at lower growth temperatures suggest that there are gradual\nincrements of disorder for graphene synthesized at lower temperatures. Even at the\nsubstrate temperature of 700 \u00b0C, however, the ratio of I2D/IG is higher than 2 and a singleLorentzian 2D peak is observed, indicating that a monolayer graphene was synthesized\nwith some defects.\nIn summary, we demonstrated that methane alone can provide sufficient amount of\nhydrogen species for single-layer graphene synthesis on Cu foil without explicit H2 flow\nby PECVD. The amount of hydrogen species dissociated from methane can be controlled\nby the plasma power and affects the nucleation and the grain size of graphene. As the\n11\n\n\fplasma power is increased, the grain size increases at low plasma power (10\u201350 W) and\ndecreases at higher plasma power (> 50 W), showing a saturation behavior when the\nplasma power is higher than 120 W. Such plasma power dependent behavior is also seen\nin the time required for a full coverage which decreases from 3 minutes to 2 minutes\nwhen the plasma power is increased from 50 to 170 W. In Raman spectra, the ratio of\nI2D/IG and the FWHM of the 2D band are highly enhanced and saturated to ~3.8 and ~31\ncm-1, respectively, when the plasma power is higher than 30 W. Our work clarifying the\ndual role of methane (as a hydrogen source as well as a carbon source) helps the\nunderstanding of graphene growth mechanism by PECVD and guides further\nimprovements.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported by the Priority Research Centers Program (2012-0005859),\nthe Basic Science Research Program (2012-0007298, 2012-040278), Nanomaterial\nTechnology Development Program (2012M3A7B4049888), and the Center for\nTopological Matter in POSTECH (2011-0030786) through the National Research\nFoundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and\nTechnology (MEST).

ICP-CVD system\n1.1 Detailed geometry\nFig. S1a shows a schematic diagram of the inductively coupled plasma chemical vapor\ndeposition (ICP-CVD) system. At the top of the chamber, RF coil is mounted below the\ninlet ports which allow gas flow into the chamber. The diameter of RF coil is about 25\ncm and the center of the coil is located 35 cm above the top surface of the graphite\nsubstrate holder. Plasma is generated by applying 13.56 MHz RF bias power to the RF\ncoil. No bias voltage is applied to the substrate stage, because it is known that the\nelectric field aligned perpendicular to the surface prevents planar growth of graphene and\nresults in vertically standing graphene sheets.1, 2\n\n1.2 Substrate heating by plasma\n\n24\n\n\fTo investigate the heating effect of substrate by RF plasma, the substrate temperature\nis monitored under different plasma powers of 50 and 400 W. It is conducted without\nfilament heating of substrate and the temperature is measured by a K-type thermocouple\nwhich is attached to substrate. When the plasma power is 400 W, the temperature\nincreases only about 3 \u00b0C after 12 minutes (Fig. S1b). When the plasma power is\nreduced to 50 W, the temperature does not change even after 14 minutes. Considering\nthe plasma powers (< 200 W) and the growth times (\u2264 3 minutes) used in the graphene\ngrowth, we conclude that the substrate heating effect by RF plasma is negligible in our\nsystem.\n\nFig. S1 (a) Schematic diagram of ICP-CVD system. Remote plasma is generated above\nthe substrate. (b) Substrate heating effect by plasma under different plasma powers of 50\nand 400 W.\n\n2. Differential-pumping technique for mass spectra measurement\n\n25\n\n\fA residual gas analyzer (RGA 100, Stanford Research Systems) is attached at the main\nchamber to investigate the mass spectra of discharged species. The high pressure of ~102\n\nTorr during the graphene growth is not suitable for the measurement because the RGA\n\nsystem requires a high vacuum (<10-4 Torr) environment. While the pressure could be\nlowered to the desired level by reducing the gas flow, plasma could not be generated in\nthis case; the pressure should be higher than 10-3 Torr to generate plasma. To overcome\nthese two conflicting issues, we employed a differential pumping technique3 in our ICPCVD system by mounting an aluminum aperture (inner hole diameter ~5 mm) underneath\nthe plasma reactor as shown in Fig. S2. Due to the highly reduced pumping conductance\nbetween the plasma reactor and the main chamber, we are able to keep ~10-2 Torr in the\nplasma reactor and ~10-4 Torr in the main chamber under proper gas flows (Ar/CH4 = 5:5\nsccm). We investigated the mass spectra of discharged species in this configuration.\n\nFig. S2 Illustration of ICP-CVD system with an aluminum aperture mounted underneath\nthe plasma reactor for differential pumping.\n\n26\n\n\f3.
