We recover the\nresults by Mathisson-Papapetrou, hence establishing a fundamental correspondence between the\ncoupling of classical and quantum spinning particles with the gravitational field.\n\nI- Introduction. \u2013 Mathisson [1] and Papapetrou [2]\ndescribed the behaviour of a spinning particle in general\nrelativity (GR). The work of Papapetrou is particularly\nworth noting. He performed a multipole expansion around\nthe worldline. The motion turns out to be non-geodesic,\nbecause of the interaction between spin and curvature,\nwhile the evolution of the spin consists in a precession\naround the generalized momentum.\nSince the Mathisson-Papapetrou system does not reproduce the classical force for the spin-orbit interaction [3],\nPomeransky and Khriplovich [4] adopted a different procedure. Given a distribution of energy momentum T\u03bc\u03bd in\na background metric g\u03bc\u03bd , they imposed the conservation\nof the spin tensor along the trajectory and a coupling term\nof the form h\u03bc\u03bd T\u03bc\u03bd , h\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd , \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd being Minkowsky\nmetric.\nThe dynamical equations obtained within these two frameworks are different.\n\nthe equations describing the evolution of the spin and of\nthe momentum associated to a semi-classical spinor in a\nweak gravitational field coincide with the PomeranskyKhriplovich equations.\nIn this work, the classical-quantum spinning particles\ncomparison is made only when a proper classical description is inferred from quantum theory. This implies that\nthe quantum field must be localized, such that a trajectory\ncan be properly defined. In this respect, we face a second\norder approach to the semi-classical limit of Dirac particles moving on a curved space-time by an eikonal approximation and a localization hypothesis along the world-line.\nThe latter is obtained to the lowest order of a multi-pole\nexpansion la Papapetrou (single-pole), such that by spatial integration one deals with quantities having support\non the world-line. Within this scheme we are able to derive a dispersion relation from the squared Dirac equation\nsuch that general covariance is manifest. No restriction to\nweak gravitational fields is imposed. Finally we retain the\nleading order in the semi-classical expansion, which means\nthe first order in the spin, and we get a set of equations\nwhich coincide with the Mathisson-Papapetrou ones.\nFor a different approach to recover Papapetrou-like equations from the semi-classical dynamics of Dirac particles,\nin the context of using Grassmanian variables, see [9].\n\nOn the quantum level, Audrescht [5] constructed the\nsemi-classical limit of the Dirac equation on a curved\nspace-time using the eikonal approximation (the case with\na non-vanishing torsion is presented in [6]). If the classical\n4-momentum was identified with the convection current,\nthe equations dexribing the trajectory and spin evolution\nturned out to be the Papapetrou equations. However, the\ntransition to the classical picture in terms of a localised\nII- Papapetrou formulation. \u2013 In GR a moving\nworldline was not discussed.\nbody is described by an energy-momentum tensor having\nRecently, Silenko and Teryaev [7] found, applying a Foldy- support on the world-tube \u03c4 . In order to determine the\nWouthuysen transformation [8] on the Hamiltonian, that dynamics of the body and of the gravitational field, one\np-1\n\n\fF. Cianfrani et al.\nshould solve the corresponding set of Einstein equations.\nHowever, the solution of this system of partial differential\nequations is a rather difficult task, therefore a very useful\napproximation consists in neglecting the back-reaction of\nthe body, by assigning a fixed space-time geometry.\nThis way the full dynamical information is encoded in the\nenergy-momentum conservation \u2207\u03bc T \u03bc\u03bd = 0. Inside \u03c4 one\nidentifies a curve X \u03bc (s) and calculates momenta of the\nbody [2].\nThe multi-pole expansion consists in an expansion around\nX \u03bc (s). At the zero-order one retains only the first moment, which means that the gradients of the gravitational\nfield are neglected over the whole spatial extension of the\nbody. This way, X \u03bc (s) results in a geodesic curve, as\nexpected. At the next order of approximation (the poledipole case) gradients of the Christoffel connections are\nno longer neglected. Hence the following quantity (spin\ntensor)\nZ\nZ\nS \u03bc\u03bd =\n\u03b4x\u03bc T \u03bd0 d\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b4x\u03bd T \u03bc0 d\u03c4\n(1)\n\u03c4\n\n\u03c4\n\ninitial conditions.\nThe key point of our treatment consists in the existence\nof two length scales. The first one gives the initial wave\npacket spread and we denote this scale with \u03bb = \u03b1\u03bbc ,\n\u03bbc being the Compton scale, while \u03b1 > 1. The second\nlength scale we deal with is the radius of curvature of the\nspace-time manifold, \u0131.e. the one associated with the gravitational field. We indicate it by L. In view of applying\nthe theory of quantum fields on a curved space-time, we\nrequire L >> \u03b1\u03bbc . This condition is necessary to recover\na proper notion of particle and when violated we enter into\nthe quantum gravity regime.\nGiven a time-like Killing vector, the energy of the particle q\ncan be defined by a dispersion relation of the form\n2\n\n\u03c9 = \u03bc~2 + g ij ki kj .\nStarting with a wave-packet centered around the wave vector ~k0 = (k0 , 0, 0), the corresponding wave function reads\nas follows\nZ\n2\n2\n2\n2 (k1 \u2212k0 ) +k2 +k3\n~\n2\n\u03c6(x, t) \u221d d3 ke\u2212\u03bb\neik*~x\u2212i\u03c9(k)t , (4)\n\nis non-vanishing and it enters into equations of motion\n1/\u03bb being the spread in the momentum space (we take\ngiving\n\uf8f1 D \u03bc\nit as isotropic).

Although by passing from firstto second-order equations the set of solutions is enlarged,\nnevertheless in this semi-classical context this procedure\nhas to be regarded as a correct one. In fact, it allows us to\ntreat spinor particles as scalar ones with an ~ correction\nt*\nt\ndue to the spinor structure.\nNevertheless, it is worth noting that differences exist beFigure 1: The solid line gives the expectation value of the positween\nour method and the one carried on in [7], where the\ntion, while the dotted, dash-dotted and dashed ones correspond\nsemi-classical\nlimit is performed by a Foldy-Wouthuysen\nto the variation of the spread, i.e. \u03c3(t) \u2212 \u03bb, in cases \u03b1v < 1,\ntransformation.\n\u03b1v = 1 and \u03b1v > 1, respectively.

However, in view of the great difference between the Compton\nscale and that one characteristic of macroscopic phenomena, there is a large set of velocities available, without\naffecting the notion of particle at the initial time.\nWe emphasize that this sort of localization allows us to\ntreat particles as being point-like and to neglect spatial\ngradients in a proper reference frame (see next section)\nup to the notion of a trajectory is lost. In this approximation scheme the time variation of the spread can be\nneglected too and in what follows we will treat it as constant.

As far as particles coming from extra-galactic\nsources are concerned, even though we are supposed to\ndeal with beams having a proper energy (no pair production), the semiclassical description is not more available\nfor observers on the Earth. Another possible experimental confirmation could come from COW-like [19,20] experiments. Since the spin couples to the curvature, trajectories at different height are characterized by a different time\nof flight, which add a further contribution to the quantum\ninterference. However, such an additional term is well below experimental uncertainty [23].\nA different way of detecting the interaction between the\nspin and the gravitation field is the appearance of an effective polarization. Given a source emitting a beam of Dirac\nparticles whose polarization oscillates with a certain frequency \u03a9, the different time of flight for particles with\ndifferent spins gives a correction to the polarization measured by a distant observer.

The main point\nis the way this limit has been taken. While the eikonal\napproximation is the standard tool to derive classical mechanics from quantum mechanics, the hypothesis of localization is proper of our treatment, since other approaches\ndo not consider it [5, 15]. But we want to stress that to\nmake a comparison with the behavior of classical objects,\na classical trajectory must come out from the quantum\ndescription.\nWe obtain such a feature by a multi-pole expansion and,\nsince we are describing an intrinsic spin, we have to retain\nonly the monopole term when taking the classical limit.\nThe best we can do is to localize wave functions at the\nCompton scale order, but we were able to define quantities on their mean values by a spatial integration. Such a\nkind of integration is proper of the Papapetrou approach\nand this way a trajectory is well-defined.\n\nThis formulation provided with a notion of spin tensor,\nwhose quantum character is manifest, because it arises\nas a first order correction in the semi-classical approximation, and whose physical interpretation is clear as the\nexpectation value of the spin density. Furthermore, general covariance is manifest during all calculations, while no\nweak-field approximation takes place for the gravitational\nfield.\nThe dynamics reproduces the results by Mathisson and\nPapapetrou at the first order in the spin. Hence, there is\nno agreement with the papers [7], where the semi-classical\nlimit is performed by a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation\non the Hamiltonian and the Pomeransky-Kriplovich formulation is obtained. These two different procedures allow us to infer a semi-classical picture, but they provide\ndifferent results for the classical dynamics.\nTherefore, it is possible to infer from a quantum description both the two compelling formulations for spinning\nparticles in GR. Only the experimental detection of deviations from geodesic motion would tell us what is the appropriate semi-classical procedure for Dirac fields in curved\nspace-time.\nAcknowledgment. \u2013 We thank Claus Laemmerzahl\nfor having called our attention on [5, 6].\nReferences\n[1] Mathisson M., Acta Phys.
