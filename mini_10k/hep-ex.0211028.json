With extensive\nupgrades on both detectors and electronics the CDF II began to collect data. This paper\nreviews early Run II physics results obtained by analyzing data collected before the middle of\njune 2002. At the present the understanding of the detector performances is rather high so\nmany analysis are already underway.\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Run II Tevatron upgrades\nThe Fermilab Tevatron Collider has undergone, in the past few years, a whole series of\nupgrades to increase the instantaneous luminosity and to improve the collider bunch structure.\nDuring the first phase of the Run II (Run IIA) the machine is expected to deliver to each of\nthe two collider experiments: CDF and D\u2205, a goal luminosity of up to 5\u00f78\u00d71031 cm2*s-1 with\na center of mass energy of 1.96 TeV that is a bit larger than the 1.8 TeV of the Run I.\nDuring the present Run IIA the Tevatron is operating much like in the previous Run IB with a\nhigher integrated luminosity mostly coming from an increase in the number of bunches and\nslightly higher proton and antiproton bunch intensities. The planned integrated luminosity\nexpected by the end of Run IIA is fixed to \u2248 2 fb \u22121 .\nThe bunch structure of the Tevatron Collider have been changed. Indeed, we passed from the\n6\u00d76 proton-antiproton bunches of the Run I to the present 36\u00d736. The replacement of the\nMain Ring with the Main Injector as the injection source for the Tevatron collider, leaded to\nan increased number of protons per store and at the same time eliminated a source of\nbackground for the detectors. Several upgrades also increased the number of antiprotons per\nstore. New Main Injector creates antiproton beam with higher intensity and energy than in the\nRun I. In addition, the plan is to recycle 'unused' antiprotons at the end of a collider store\nrather than dump them. When the Recycler will be fully operational we expect to reach\ninstantaneous luminosity up to 2\u00d71032 cm2*s-1.\n\n\fSilicon tracking\n\nCMX\nIMU\n\nb)\n\nCMX Mini skirt\n\nCOT\n\nCMP\n\na)\n\nc)\n\nFIG. 1. a) 3-Dimensional view of the CDF II detector configuration; the cutaway view of\nhalf section of the inner portion of the CDF II detector shows the inner tracking region\nsurrounded by solenoid, endcap calorimeters and, in the most external part, by the muon\nsystem (CMP, CMX and IMU); b) view of the SVX detector; c) view of ISL detector.\n\n2. The CDF II Detector Improvements\nBoth Tevatron Collider Detectors have been improved in order to operate with the new\nmachine performances that means mainly with an increased instantaneous luminosity as well\nas the critical bunch spacing structure. In addition, there have been several upgrades to\nincrease the sensitivity of the detector to specific physics tasks such as heavy flavor physics,\nHiggs boson searches and many others. A detailed description of the CDF detector upgrades\nmay be found in the following documents [1], [2]. Figure 1.a shows a 3D cutaway view of the\nfinal configuration of the CDF II experiment. The central tracking volume of the CDF II\nexperiment has been replaced entirely with new detectors, the central calorimeters has not\nbeen changed, the muon system has been mainly increased in coverage. These upgrades can\nbe summarized as follow:\n1.

It consists of doublesided silicon sensors with a combination of both 90-degree and small-angle stereo layers.\nThe SVX II is nearly twice as long as the original SVX and SVX' (96 cm instead of 51\ncm), which were constrained to fit within a previous gas-based track detector (VTX), used\nto locate the position of interactions along the beam line. SVX II has 5 layers instead of 4\nof the two previous silicon vertex detectors and it is able to give 3-dimensional\ninformation on the tracks.\nIntermediate Silicon Layer (ISL) is a large radius ( RMin = 22.6 cm , RMax = 29.0 cm )\nsilicon tracker with a total active area of \u2248 3.5 m 2 . It is composed of 296 basic units,\ncalled ladders, made of three silicon sensors bonded together in order to form one electric\nunit. Figure 1.c gives a schematic representation of the ISL detector. It is located between\nthe Silicon Vertex Detector and the Central Outer Chamber. Being at a distance of\n22.6 \u00f7 29.0 cm in the central part, from the beam-line, it covers a pseudo-rapidity region\nup to \u03b7 < 2 .\n2. Central Outer Tracker (COT): that is the new CDF II central tracking chamber. It is an\nopen cell drift chamber able to operate at a beam crossing time of \u2248 132 ns with a\nmaximum drift time of \u2248 100 ns . The COT consists of 96 layers arranged in four axial\nand four stereo superlayers. It also provides dE / dx information for particle\nidentification.\n3. Time-of-Flight Detector (TOF): New scintillator based Time-Of-Flight detector has\nbeen added using the small space available between the COT and the solenoid. With 110\nps time-of-flight resolution, the TOF system enhances the capability to tag charged kaons\nin the PT range from \u2248 0.6 to few GeV / c as requested from the B physics searches\nunderway.

Figure 3.c and 3.d demonstrate how significantly change signal and\nbackground separation by adding TOF information in the \u03a6(1020) reconstruction.\n4. Plug Calorimeter: A new scintillating tile plug calorimeter has been realized in order to\nhave a good electron identification up to a pseudorapidity range of \u03b7 < 2 .\n5. Muon system has also been upgraded. The coverage in the central region has been almost\ndoubled compared to Run I situation. And a new forward detector, the (IMU) have been\nadded.\n6. Trigger The CDF II trigger is organized in 3 different levels. The Level 1 trigger (L1) is a\ndead-timeless trigger with a 42 stage pipeline and can make a trigger decision every 132\nns with a total latency time of 5544 ns. A new online processor reconstruct COT tracks\n(eXtremely Fast Tracker). L2 trigger adds information within \u2248 20 \u03bcs , to the objects\nfound by L1 trigger (electromagnetic or hadronic parts of the calorimeters, missing\ntransverse energy, stubs in the muon system).\n7.

RUN II Early Physics Results\n3.1 B Physics\nB physics is an extraordinary laboratory to test several fundamental aspects of the Standard\nModel (SM). During the Run I, 1992-1996, 110 pb-1 of data had been collected and used to\nperform important B physics measurements [3] including the first sin(2 \u03b2 ) measurement on\nunitary triangle. The Tevatron collider, as mater of fact, is an excellent place for B physics\nstudies both because it is possible to produce the full spectrum of mesons and baryons with b\nquarks, and also because the b hadrons production cross section is large (compare 100 mb\nwith few nb of e+e- colliders). Many of the described detector upgrades have been done\nindeed with a large emphasis on heavy quark physics (c, b, t). CDF Run II physics program\ncan be synthesized as follow. CP violation measurements using modes such as B \u2192 J / \u03c8K s ,\nB \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 , Bs \u2192 KK and Bs \u2192 Ds K , Bs Mixing, searches for rare B decays, measurement of\nlifetimes, masses and branching ratios. At present, the B physics program is going through the\nrefining of triggers strategies and performing various high rate measurements. Later on, we\nplan to measure the sin(2 \u03b2 ) along with a measurement of Bs0 flavour oscillations by fully\nreconstructing Bs0 decays ( Bs0 \u2192 Ds\u2212\u03c0 + and Bs0 \u2192 Ds\u2212\u03c0 +\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 + with Ds\u2212 reconstructed as\n\n\u03c6\u03c0 \u2212 , K *0 K \u2212 , K s0 K \u2212 ) and then, after more than 200 \u00f7 300 pb \u22121 will be available, the study\nof rare decays, together with the refining of the previously performed measurements, will take\nover. Preliminary CDF Run II results are shown in Fig. 5 and in Table I.\n\n\fBs\n\nBd\n\nBu\n\na)\n\nc)\n\nb)\n\nFIG. 5.

B hadrons are then selected by using three general trigger strategies:\n1. Hadronic Trigger;\n2. Lepton plus displaced track Trigger;\n3. Di-lepton Trigger:\nThe first trigger strategy take advantage of the long B hadrons lifetime to discriminate fully\nhadronic B decays from background. For the Run II CDF have been equipped with a\nSecondary Vertex Trigger (SVT) that selects events that pass at Level 1 the loose request of\nhaving two tracks with PTtrk > 2 GeV / c in the event and, at Level 2, a displaced vertex,\nsearched by requiring a large impact parameter: D0 > 100\u03bcm . This trigger is extremely useful\nas it is able to selects both rare two body decays such as: B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 (KK ) , relevant for CP\nviolation measurement, as well as hadronic B \u00b1 decays. The lepton plus displaced track\ntrigger is a trigger that selects events containing electron or muons with PTtrk > 4 GeV / c with\nthe further request of an additional track with large impact parameter. Di-lepton Trigger looks\nfor the presence of two opposite sign muons with PT\u03bc >1.5 GeV / c or two opposite sign\nelectrons with PTe > 2.0 GeV / c . This trigger is relevant in selecting events as B \u2192 J / \u03c8K S\nthat will be used for measuring both sin 2 \u03b2 and the exclusive B meson lifetimes and also to\nsearch for EWK penguin decays such as B \u2192 K (*) l + l \u2212 and other rare decays such as:\nB(s ) \u2192 l + l \u2212 .\n\nMass(MeV/c2)\n\nB Meson\nBu+\n\n\u2192\n\nJ / \u03c8K +\n\nB\n\n\u2192 J / \u03c8K\n\nB\n\n\u2192\n\n0\nd\n0\ns\n\n0*\n\nJ / \u03c8\u03c6\n\n\u2206PDG/\u03c3\nPDG/\u03c3 (CDF)\n\n\u03c3 (CDF)/\u03c3\n(CDF)/\u03c3 (PDG)\n\n5280.6 \u00b1 1.7 \u00b1 1.1\n\n+ 0.77\n\n4.05\n\n5279.8 \u00b1 1.9 \u00b1 1.4\n5360.3 \u00b1 3.8 \u00b1 22..19\n\n+ 0.17\n\u2212 1.81\n\n4.72\n1.90\n\nTABLE I.

Large amounts of Cabibbo suppressed D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 decays and\nD 0 \u2192 \u03c0 +\u03c0 \u2212 are also observed. Other D species are also observed as shown in Fig. 6. Direct\ncharm production is separated from charm coming for B meson decays by looking at the\nimpact parameter. CDF II is at present measuring the differential production cross section for:\nD 0 , D + , D *+ , Ds and \u039b c hadrons. Charged modes such as D + \u2192 K + K \u2212\u03c0 + and neutral\nmodes such as D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 +\u03c0 \u2212 will be both used in order to search for direct CP violation.\n\nDecay Channel\n\nEvents\n\nD0\nD0\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\nK\u03c0\nKK\n\n6 \u00d7105\n4 \u00d710 4\n\nD0\n\n\u2192\n\n2 \u00d710 4\n\nD+\nDs\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\n\u03c0\u03c0\nK\u03c0\u03c0\nKK\u03c0\n\nD *+\n\u039bc\n\n\u2192 D 0\u03c0 ( D 0 \u2192 K\u03c0 )\n\u2192\npK\u03c0\n\n4 \u00d7105\n2 \u00d710 4\n1.6 \u00d710 4\n600\n\nTABLE II.

During the Run I CDF measured the W\nboson mass with a precision of about 80 MeV / c 2 leading to a combined CDF and D\u2205 results\nof M W = 80.447 \u00b1 0.042 GeV / c 2 that is the world's most precise measurement [4]. CDF II is\n\nexpecting to measure the W mass with a precision of \u03b4M W \u2248 30 MeV / c 2 on an integrated\nluminosity of 2 fb \u22121 . We started to look to all 3 leptonic decay channels of the W:\nW \u2192 l\u03bd l (l = e, \u03bc ,\u03c4 ) using the data collected till now. The W boson mass is extracted from\nfitting, with appropriate invariant mass, the transverse mass distribution defined as:\n2\nr\nr\nM T \u2261 (ETl + ET\u03bd ) \u2212( pTl \u2212 pT\u03bd ) .

In figure 7.c we\ncompare the number of tracks expected in the \u03c4 \u2212 jet for W \u2192\u03c4\u03bd \u03c4 signal and for the QCD\nbackground (MC) with the W \u2192\u03c4\u03bd \u03c4 from the data. Events are selected by requiring an\nisolated electron or muon with PT > 25 GeV / c 2 and the presence of a consistent amount of\nmissing transverse energy E/ T > 25 GeV . By analyzing 10 pb \u22121 we found 5547 W.\nThe W signal is quite clean indeed we expect the background fraction not to exceed \u2248 7 % .\nThis sample have been used also to estimate the production cross section:\n\u03c3 W \u00d7 BR(W \u2192 e\u03bd e ) = 2.60 \u00b1 0.03 ( Stat ) \u00b1 0.26 ( Lu min osity ) nb and found to be consistent\nwith the Run I measurement.\nWe have already clean Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 and Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 samples. Figure 8.a, 8.b, 8.c show the\nZ \u2192 e + e \u2212 invariant mass as reconstructed for central-central electrons, central-plug electrons\nand using electrons having both the legs into the plug detector.

Run II dielectron Top candidate as displayed using the CD II event display.\n\nchannel is underway and, also for this analysis, preliminary results will viable for the winter\nconferences.\n\n3.4 Top Quark Physics\nAt Tevatron, top quarks are predominantly pair-produced, with each top quark decaying to a\nW and to a b quark: tt \u2192 WbWb . The increase in the center of mass energy from 1.8 TeV to\n1.96 TeV was mainly motivated by the consistent rise of the top quark production cross\nsection of \u2248 30 \u00f7 35 % . CDF II is expecting to collect a top quark sample \u2248 30 times bigger\nthan in run I, assuming an integrated luminosity of \u2248 2 fb \u22121 . At present we are finalizing\nimportant tools such as the b-tagging based both on jet probability and on b hadron vertex\ndisplacement and the jet corrections. CDF II can expect to measure, using the first 2 fb \u22121 the\ntop quark mass with a precision of \u03b4M t \u2248 3 GeV / c 2 . During the Run I the combined CDF\nand D\u2205 top quark mass measurement was: M t = 174.3 \u00b1 5.1 GeV / c 2 [5]. Combined\nknowledge of M t and M W will allow us to set a more stringent limit on the Standard Model\nHiggs mass [6]. In figure 9 we show one of the Run II di-electron top candidates\n( tt \u2192 W +W \u2212 bb \u2192 e +\u03bd e e \u2212\u03bd e bb ). Both in the central cutaway and lego plot is possible to see\nthe two candidate electron and jets present in the final state.\n\n\fFIG 10. Integrated luminosity required per experiment to either exclude at 95% C.L. or\ndiscover with a 3\u03c3 or 5\u03c3 significance a SM Higgs boson.\n\n4.\n\nHiggs Potential\n\nAt Tevatron the Higgs boson is expected to be produced mainly via gluon fusion or in\nassociation with W or Z bosons. Although the gluon fusion mode gives the most important\ncontribution to the Higgs production, it will be overwhelmed by the large QCD background.\nTherefore, given sufficient luminosity, the most promising SM Higgs discovery mechanism\nfor m H < 130 GeV / c 2 consists of qq annihilation into a virtual V * ( V = W , Z ), where the\nvirtual V * \u2192 VhSM followed by hSM \u2192 bb and the leptonic decay of the V that will serve as a\ntrigger. The main background for this mode will be Wbb and WZ processes. For\n120 GeV / c 2 < m H < 190 GeV / c 2 , where the Higgs is produced with a vector bosons, it will\nmainly decay into W *W * states with subsequent decay (W ,Z )W *W * \u2192 l \u00b1\u03bdl \u00b1\u03bdjj . For this\ncase selection criteria requires two leptons with PT > 10 GeV / c having the same charge and\ntwo separate jets with ETjet > 15 GeV / c and the presence of missing transverse energy. The\nmain background in this case is WZjj production. Among various analyses underway some\ninteresting result could also come from the use of neural networks techniques. The integrated\nluminosity required per each Tevatron experiment, to exclude a 115 GeV / c 2 SM Higgs\nboson at 95% C.L. is 2 fb \u22121 .\n\n\f5.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we reviewed recent CDF II results reporting on the status of the detector and its\nupgrades. The CDF II detector is presently performing very well and has collected until the\nmiddle of June 50 pb-1 of data. We expect by the end of this year to reach an integrated\nluminosity of \u2248 200 pb \u22121 . The understanding of the detector performances is very advanced\nso many physics analysis are in progress. With the new detector capabilities a broad physics\nprogram is within our reach. We expect to present new interesting results by the winter 2003.\n\n6.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI wish to thank the Organizers of the SUSY02 Conference for the excellent conference and\ntheir kind hospitality.\n\n7.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] F.
