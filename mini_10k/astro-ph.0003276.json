They\ncontain over a solar mass of matter within a radius of \u223c 10 km at densities of order\n1015 g/cc. They probe the properties of cold matter at extremely high densities,\nand have proven to be fantastic test bodies for theories of general relativity.\nIn a broader perspective, neutron stars and heavy ion collisions provide access\nto the phase diagram of matter at extreme densities and temperatures, that is\nbasic for understanding the very early Universe and several other astrophysical\nphenomena.\nThe discovery of the neutron by Chadwick in 1932 prompted Landau [1] to\npredict the existence of neutron stars. The first theoretical calculations of neutron\nstars were performed by Oppenheimer and Volkoff [2] in 1939 assuming that they\nare gravitationally bound states of neutron Fermi gas. The calculated stars had\na maximum mass of \u223c 0.7 M\u2299 , central densities up to \u223c 6 \u00d7 1015 g/cm3 and\nradii \u223c 10 km. For comparison the density of nuclear matter inside a large\nnucleus like 208 Pb is \u223c 0.16 nucleons/fm3 , i.e. \u2243 2.7 \u00d71014 g/cm3 [3]. Their\npredicted maximum mass was less than the Chandrasekhar mass limit of \u223c 1.4\nM\u2299 for white dwarfs made up of iron group nuclei, and having densities up to\n\u223c 109 g/cm3 [4]. The pressure to balance the gravitational attraction in white\ndwarfs and Oppenheimer-Volkoff neutron stars is supplied by degenerate electron\nand neutron Fermi gases respectively.\nIn 1934 Baade and Zwicky [5] suggested that neutron stars may be formed in\nsupernovae in which the iron core of a massive star exceeds the Chandrasekhar\nlimit and collapses. The large amount of energy released in the collapse blows\naway the rest of the star and the collapsed core may form a neutron star. For\nefficient production of neutron stars with this mechanism, the maximum mass\nof neutron stars should exceed 1.4 M\u2299 . In the 60's, using schematic models of\nnuclear forces, Tsuruta and Cameron [6] showed that they could increase the\nneutron star masses beyond 1.4 M\u2299 .\nBell and Hewish discovered radio pulsars in 1967, and they were soon identified\nas rotating neutron stars by Gold [7]. The subsequent detection of the Crab pulsar\nin the remnant of the Crab supernova, observed in China in 1054 A.D., confirmed\nthe link to supernovae, and initiated the present efforts to better understand\nneutron stars.\n\n1.1 A Brief Overview of Observations\nAlmost 1200 pulsars have been discovered by the turn of this millennium. In these\nstars the magnetic and rotational axes are misaligned, thus they emit dipole radiation in the form of radio waves that appear to pulse on and off like a lighthouse\nbeacon as the pulsar beam sweeps across the Earth. The rotational energy loss\ndue to dipole radiation is\n\u0116 = I\u03a9\u03a9\u0307 = \u2212\n\nB 2 R6 \u03a94 sin2 \u03b8\n,\n6c3\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the moment of inertia for a typical neutron star is I \u223c 1045 g cm2 . Pulsars\nhave magnetic fields B of \u223c 1012 G, deduced from the observed \u03a9\u0307, and independently confirmed by cyclotron absorption lines found in X-ray spectra. Their\nperiods, P = 2\u03c0/\u03a9, ranging from 1.5 ms to 8.5 s, are increasing with derivatives\n\n\f3\n\u1e56 \u223c 10\u221212 \u2212 10\u221221 . The pulsar age is approximately given by P/2\u1e56 [8]; most\npulsars are old and slowly rotating with relatively small period derivatives, except\nfor a few young pulsars, e.g., those found in the Crab and Vela nebulae.\nIn 1969 the Crab and the Vela pulsars were observed to \"glitch\", i.e. to suddenly speedup with period changes \u2206P/P of the order of 10\u22128 and 10\u22126 respectively [9]. In post-glitch relaxation most of the period increase \u2206P decays.\nThese pulsars have glitched several times since then. The glitches suggest that\nthe neutron stars have a solid crust containing superfluid neutrons. The interesting structure of their crust has been recently reviewed [10], and we discuss it\nrather briefly in this report.\nThe first binary of two pulsars was found by Hulse and Taylor in 1973 and they\ncould determine many of its parameters including both masses, orbital period\nand period derivative, orbital distance and inclination. General relativity could\nbe tested to an unprecedented accuracy by measuring the inward spiralling of\nthe neutron stars in the Hulse-Taylor binary PSR 1913+16 [11]. The periastron\nadvance in PSR 1913+16 is 4.2\u25e6 per year as compared to 43\" per century for\nMercury, which originally was used by Einstein to test his theory of general\nrelativity. Six double neutron star binaries are known so far, and neutron stars\nin all of them have masses in the range 1.36 \u00b1 0.08M\u2299 [12]. They confirm that\nnuclear forces have a large effect on the structure of neutron stars and increase\ntheir maximum mass beyond 1.4 M\u2299 . Neutron stars are estimated to have a\nbinding energy of \u223c 10% of their mass. Thus \u223c 1.5 M\u2299 of nuclei are needed to\nobtain a 1.35 M\u2299 star.\n< 100\nA distinct subclass of radio pulsars are millisecond pulsars with periods \u223c\nms. The fastest pulsar known has a period of 1.56 ms [13]. The period derivatives\nof millisecond pulsars are very small corresponding to low magnetic fields \u223c\n108 \u2212 1010 G. They are believed to be recycled pulsars, i.e. old pulsars that have\nbeen spun up by mass accretion whereby the magnetic fields have decayed. About\n80% of the millisecond pulsars are in binaries whereas less than 1% of normal\nradio pulsars are in binaries. About 20 - almost half of the millisecond pulsars are found in binaries where the companion is either a white dwarf or a neutron\nstar.\nWith X-ray detectors on board satellites since the early 1970's about two hundred X-ray pulsars and bursters have been found of which the rotational period\nhas been determined for about sixty. The X-ray pulsars and bursters [14] are\n> 10M ) and low\nbelieved to be neutron stars accreting matter from high (M \u223c\n\u2299\n<\nmass (M \u223c1.2M\u2299 ) companions respectively. The X-ray pulses are attributed to\nstrong accretion on the magnetic poles emitting X-rays (as northern lights). The\nobserved radiation is pulsed with the rotational frequency of the accreting star.\nX-ray bursts are thermonuclear explosions of accreted matter on the surface of\nneutron stars. After accumulating hydrogen on the surface for hours, pressure\nand temperature become sufficient to trigger a runaway thermonuclear explosion\nseen as an X-ray burst that lasts a few seconds [14]. Masses of these stars are\nless accurately measured than for binary pulsars. We mention recent mass determinations for the X-ray pulsar Vela X-1: M = 1.87+0.23\n\u22120.17 M\u2299 [15], and the\nburster Cygnus X-2: M = 1.8 \u00b1 0.4)M\u2299 [16]. They are larger than the typical 1.36 \u00b1 0.08M\u2299 masses found in pulsars binaries, presumably due to accreted\nmatter.\nA subclass of half a dozen anomalous X-ray pulsars has been discovered. They\nare slowly rotating, P \u223c 10 sec, but rapidly slowing down. This requires huge\n\n\f4\nmagnetic fields of B \u223c 1014 G and they have appropriately been named \"magnetars\" [17]. Four gamma ray repeaters discovered so far are also believed to\nbe slowly rotating neutron stars. The magnetars and likely also the gamma ray\nrepeaters reside inside supernova remnants.\nRecently, quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) have been found in 12 binaries\nof neutron stars with low mass companions. If the QPO originate from the\ninnermost stable orbit [18, 19] of the accreting matter, their observed values\nimply that the accreting neutron stars have masses up to \u2243 2.3M\u2299 . In this case\nthe QPO's also constrain the radii of the accreting star.\nNon-rotating and non-accreting neutron stars are virtually undetectable but\nthe Hubble space telescope has observed one thermally radiating neutron star\n[20]. Its surface temperature is T \u2243 6 \u00d7 105 K\u2243 50 eV and its distance is\nless than 120 pc from Earth. Circumstantial evidence indicate a distance of\n\u223c 80 pc which leads to a radius of 12-13 km for this star. In recent years much\neffort has been devoted to measuring pulsar temperatures, especially with the\nEinstein Observatory and ROSAT. Surface temperatures of a few pulsars have\nbeen measured, and upper limits have been set for many [21].\n\u00bfFrom the human point of view supernova explosions are rare in our and neighboring galaxies. The predicted rate is 1-3 per century in our galaxy and the most\nrecent one was 1987A in LMC. No neutron star associated with this explosion\nhas been detected; however, 19 neutrinos were detected on earth from 1987A\n[22], indicating the formation of a \"proto-neutron star\". It has been suggested\nby Bethe and Brown [23] that an upper limit to the mass of neutron stars can be\nobtained assuming that the remnant of SN 1987A collapsed into a black hole.\nAstrophysicists expect a large abundance of \u223c 108 neutron stars in our galaxy.\nAt least as many supernova explosions, responsible for all heavier elements present\nin our Universe today, have occurred. The scarcity of neutron stars in the solar\nneighborhood may be due to production of black holes or other remnants in\nsupernovae, or due to a high initial velocity (asymmetric \"kick\") received during\ntheir birth in supernovae. Recently, many neutron stars have been found far\naway from their supernova remnants; and of the \u223c 1200 discovered radio pulsars\nonly about \u223c 10 can be associated with the 220 known supernova remnants.\nNeutron stars thrown out of the galactic plane may be detected by gravitational\nmicrolensing experiments [24] designed to search for dark massive objects in the\ngalactic halo.\nThe recent discovery of afterglow in Gamma Ray Bursters (GRB) allows determination of their very high redshifts (z \u2265 1). They imply that GRB occur at\nenormous distances. Evidence for beaming has been observed [25], and the estimated energy output is \u223c 1053 ergs. Such enormous energies can be produced in\nneutron star mergers eventually forming black holes. From abundance of binary\npulsars one can estimate the rate of neutron star mergers; it is compatible with\nthe rate of GRB of approximately one per day. Another possible mechanism, is\na special class of type Ic supernova (hypernovae) where cores collapse to black\nholes [26].\nThe future of neutron star observations looks bright as new windows are about\nto open. A new fleet of X- and Gamma-ray satellites have and will be launched.\nWith upgraded ground based observatories and detectors for neutrinos and gravitational waves [27] our knowledge of neutron star properties will be greatly improved.\n\n\f5\n\n1.2 Theory of Neutron Star Matter\nNeutron stars are made up of relatively cold, charge neutral matter with densities\nup to \u223c 7 times the equilibrium density \u03c10 = 0.16 nucleons/fm3 of charged nuclear\nmatter in nuclei. The matter density is > \u03c10 over most of the star, apart from the\nrelatively thin crust [10]. The Fermi energy of neutron star matter is in excess of\n< KeV, thermal effects are a\ntens of MeV, and hence, at typical temperatures of \u223c\nminor perturbation on the gross structure of the star.\nMatter at such densities has not yet been produced in the laboratory, its properties must be theoretically deduced from the available terrestrial data with guidance from observed neutron star properties. The quantities of interest are the\nphase and composition of cold catalyzed neutral dense matter, its energy density\n\u01eb(\u03c1) and pressure P (\u03c1), where \u03c1 denotes the baryon number density. The baryon\nnumber is conserved in all known interactions, therefore it is convenient to find\nthe composition by minimizing the total energy ET (\u03c1) per baryon, including rest\nmass contributions. This gives:\nP (\u03c1) = \u03c12\n\n\u01eb(\u03c1) = \u03c1ET (\u03c1),\n\n\u2202ET (\u03c1)\n.\n\u2202\u03c1\n\n(2)\n\nThe equation of state (EOS) P (\u01eb) is found by eliminating \u03c1 from the above two.\nThe gravitational equilibrium of a nonrotating star is described by the TolmanOppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) [4] Eq:\nG(\u01eb(r) + P (r)/c2 )(m(r) + 4\u03c0r 3 P (r)/c2 )\ndP (r)\n=\u2212\n,\ndr\nr 2 (1 \u2212 2Gm(r)/rc2 )\n\n(3)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, P (r) and \u01eb(r) are the pressure and mass\ndensity at radius r in the star, and\nm(r) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nr\n\n4\u03c0r \u20322 \u01eb(r \u2032 )dr \u2032 ,\n\n(4)\n\nis the mass inside r. If we neglect the general relativistic corrections of order 1/c2\nthe TOV Eq. reduces to the Newtonian hydrodynamic equation. The TOV Eq.\ncan be easily integrated starting from the central density \u01ebc ar r = 0 to find the\ndensity profile \u01eb(r). At the radius R of the star P (R) = 0, and m(R) = M is the\nmass of the star as seen from outside. The stability of the star can be deduced\nfrom the M (\u01ebc ) as discussed in [4], and the equations for rotating stars are given\nby [28]. The effect of rotation on the structure of most observed neutron stars\nseems to be rather small, however, it could be significant at periods less than a\nmillisecond [29].\nAt densities < 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u03c10 matter is believed to have the form of a lattice of\nnuclei in a relativistic degenerate electron gas [10], qualitatively similar to that of\nmetals. The main focus of the theory reviewed here has been on determining the\nproperties and EOS of matter in the density range 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u03c10 < \u03c1 < 10\u03c10 from\nterrestrial data. In the lower part of this range we expect to find nucleon matter\n(NM) composed of nucleons and electrons. In contrast to matter in nuclei, it has\nmostly neutrons with a small fraction of protons and equal number of electrons\nto maintain charge neutrality. The large Fermi energy, \u03bce \u223c 100 MeV, of the\nelectron gas limits the fraction of protons in NM.\nAt higher densities there are several possibilities including condensation of\nnegatively charged pions and kaons, occurrence of hyperons, and the transition\n\n\f6\nfrom hadronic to quark matter. All these possibilities exploit the large electron\nFermi energy of NM, therefore only one of these, if any, may occur and lower the\n\u03bce . In addition, neutron star matter can have interesting mixed phase regions in\nwhich the mixing phases are charged but the matter is overall neutral [10].\nWe begin with a review of NM, and later consider the more exotic possibilities.\nIn the last sections the range of neutron star structures predicted by theory is\npresented along with a comparison with the observational data.\n\n2\n\nEnergy-Density Functionals of Nucleon Matter\n\nThe simplest description of nuclei is obtained within the mean field approximation. It assumes, following the nuclear shell model, that nucleons occupy single\nparticle orbitals in an average potential well produced by nuclear forces. The\nenergy of the nucleus is assumed to be a functional of the orbitals occupied by\nthe nucleons, and the orbitals are determined variationally as in the HartreeFock approximation. In reality the mean field approximation is not exactly valid\nfor nuclei. The observed proton knockout reaction rates [30] indicate that the\nshell model orbitals are occupied with a probability of \u223c 70% in the simplest\nclosed shell nuclei like 208 Pb. The differences between the real and the mean field\nwave-functions, due to correlations induced by nuclear forces, are subsumed in\nthe energy functional as suggested by Kohn [31] in the context of atomic and\nmolecular physics.\nThe energy density of hypothetical, uniform NM at zero temperature is the\nmain term in the energy functionals. The nucleon orbitals in uniform matter\nare simple plane waves, and the ground state in mean field approximation is\nobtained by filling the proton and neutron states up to their Fermi momenta\nkF,N = (3\u03c0 2 \u03c1N )1/3 , where N = n, p for neutrons and protons. The energy density,\ndenoted by E(\u03c1n , \u03c1p ), includes kinetic and strong interaction contributions, but\nexcludes rest masses and the Coulomb interaction, which destabilizes uniform\ncharged matter. The total density is denoted by \u03c1 = \u03c1n + \u03c1p , the asymmetry of\nthe matter is defined as \u03b2 = (\u03c1n \u2212 \u03c1p )/\u03c1, and the energy per nucleon, E(\u03c1, \u03b2), is\ngiven by E(\u03c1, \u03b2)/\u03c1.\nAnalysis of nuclear properties with the liquid drop model [3] reveals that,\nin the absence of electromagnetic forces, the ground state of NM is symmetric (i.e. \u03b2 = 0), has total equilibrium density \u03c10 = 0.16 \u00b1 0.01 fm\u22123 , and binding\nenergy E0 = \u221216\u00b10.5 MeV per nucleon. The symmetry energy Esym (\u03c10 ) = 34\u00b16\nMeV, is defined as 21 \u2202 2 E/\u2202\u03b2 2 at equilibrium. The NM energy E(\u03c1, \u03b2) can\nbe expanded about its minimum value at \u03b2 = 0 in powers of \u03b2 2 , assuming\ncharge symmetry of nuclear forces. In variational [32] as well as Brueckner\n[33] theories the coefficients of terms with \u03b2 n\u22654 are estimated to be small, and\nE(\u03c1, \u03b2) \u2248 (1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )E(\u03c1, 0) + \u03b2 2 E(\u03c1, 1). In this approximation the symmetry energy is the difference between the energy of pure neutron matter and symmetric\nnuclear matter. The incompressibility K0 = 240 \u00b1 30 MeV [34] of symmetric\nnuclear matter is defined as K0 = kF2 \u2202 2 E/\u2202kF2 at equilibrium. The energies of\nthe collective breathing mode vibrations of nuclei are sensitive to K0 ; however,\nin all stable nuclei the surface effects are significant. It is difficult to extract the\ndensity and \u03b2-dependence of the incompressibility, and the density-dependence\nof the symmetry energy from available nuclear data.\nAnalysis of elastic scattering of nucleons by nuclei shows that the nuclear mean\n\n\f7\nfield has a dependence on the energy of the moving nucleon [3]. Over a wide\nenergy range this dependence is approximately linear, suggesting that nucleons\nin equilibrium nuclear matter have an effective mass m\u22c6 \u223c 0.7m, where m is the\nfree nucleon mass. This effective mass should not be identified with the Landau\neffective mass which describes the density of single particle states in a narrow\nenergy interval about the Fermi energy [35, 36]. The Landau m\u22c6 in uniform\nmatter is difficult to extract from nuclear data, since nucleons at the Fermi energy\nare strongly coupled to nuclear surface dynamics. Some of the phenomenological\nenergy functionals are chosen to fit the observed nuclear level densities at the\nFermi energy, while others fit the value of m\u22c6 (\u03c10 , 0) obtained from the energy\ndependence of the optical model potential [37].\nThe nonrelativistic functionals based on Skyrme effective interactions [37] generally contain the following terms:\nE(\u03c1n , \u03c1p ) = \u03c4 (1+x5 \u03c1)+x1 \u03c12 (1+x2 \u03c1\u03b1 )+\n\nX h\n\ni\n\nx6 \u03c4N \u03c1N + x3 \u03c12N (1 + x4 \u03c1\u03b1 ) . (5)\n\nN =n,p\n\n2 \u03c1 /m are the kinetic energy densities, and \u03c4 = \u03c4 + \u03c4 . The\nHere \u03c4N = 0.6kF,N\nN\nn\np\nparameters x1 to x4 and \u03b1 describe the \u03c1 and \u03b2 dependence of the volume integral\nof the static part of the effective interaction between nucleons in matter, while\nthe x5 and x6 describe effective masses produced by the momentum dependence\nof the effective interaction. In principle the values of the seven parameters in\na typical Skyrme functional are constrained by the empirically known values of\n\u03c10 , E0 , Esym (\u03c10 ) and K and the choice made for m\u22c6 (\u03c10 , 0). However, since\nthe constraints are insufficient, there are many Skyrme models of the energy\nfunctional.\nThe simple form of the functional (Eq.5) chosen by most Skyrme models is\nconvenient, but the real functional can be much more complex. The analytic\nform of the energy density predicted by realistic models of nuclear forces, as\ndiscussed in the next chapter, has been studied by Ravenhall [38]. A much more\nelaborate function of the type:\n\np10\n2\n+ p11 e(p9 \u03c1)\nE(\u03c1n , \u03c1p ) = \u2212\u03c1 p1 e\n+ p2 (1 \u2212 e\n)+\n\u03c1\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n1\np12\n(p9 \u03c1)2\n2\n\u2212p6 \u03c1\n\u2212p6 \u03c1\n\u2212 (\u03c1n \u2212 \u03c1p ) p7 e\n+ p13 e\n+ p8 (1 \u2212 e\n)+\n4\n\u03c1\n2\n\n\u0014\n\n\u2212p6 \u03c1\n\n\u2212p6 \u03c1\n\n+\n\nX\n\nN =n,p\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0015\n\n\u03c4N 1 + (p3 \u03c1 + p5 \u03c1N )e\u2212p4 \u03c1 ,\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n\n(6)\n\nis required to reproduce the predicted E(\u03c1n , \u03c1p ) up to \u03b2 = 1 and \u03c1 \u223c 1 fm\u22123 . This\nfunctional also explains the nuclear binding energies and the empirically known\nvalues for symmetric nuclear matter [39], however, it is unlikely that the values\nof all of its thirteen parameters can be obtained by fitting nuclear data.\nThe energy of NM can be easily calculated from a covariant effective Lagrangian\nin the mean field approximation, as shown by Walecka [40], and in the past\ndecade many properties of medium and heavy nuclei have been studied with this\napproach [41]. The effective Lagrangian used in the recent work has the form:\n1\n1\n1\nL = \u03c8\u0304 [\u03b3 \u03bc (i\u2202\u03bc \u2212 g\u03c9 \u03c9\u03bc \u2212 g\u03c1~\u03c4 * \u03c1\n~\u03bc ) \u2212 m \u2212 g\u03c3 \u03c3] \u03c8 \u2212 m2\u03c3 \u03c3 2 + g2 \u03c3 3 + g3 \u03c3 4\n2\n3\n4\n1 2 \u03bc\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\n1 ~ \u03bc\u03bd ~\n1 2 \u03bc\n~\u03bc \u2212 \u03a9 \u03a9\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 R * R\u03bc\u03bd , (7)\n+ m\u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9\u03bc + m\u03c1 \u03c1~ * \u03c1\n2\n2\n4\n4\n\n\f8\nHear \u03c8, \u03c9\u03bc and \u03c1~\u03bc are respectively the nucleon and \u03c9 and \u03c1 vector-meson fields.\nOverhead arrows are used to denote isospin vectors, and \u03a9\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202 \u03bc \u03c9 \u03bd \u2212 \u2202 \u03bd \u03c9 \u03bc etc.\nThe effective scalar field \u03c3 is responsible for nuclear binding, and the \u03c3 3 and \u03c3 4\nterms are necessary to obtain the empirical incompressibility of nuclear matter\n[42]. The isovector \u03c1~ field is required to obtain the empirical symmetry energy.\nThe observed values of the masses m, m\u03c9 and m\u03c1 are used, and the coupling\nconstants g\u03c9 , g\u03c1 , g\u03c3 , g2 and g3 , as well as the mass m\u03c3 of the effective scalar\nfield are adjusted to fit the nuclear data. The above Lagrangian, without the \u03c3 3\nand \u03c3 4 terms but including pion fields and their coupling to the nucleon, is also\nused to model the two-nucleon interaction discussed in the next section.\nThe relativistic mean field theory of nuclei is very elegant and often used to\nstudy properties of neutron star matter [43]. It has provided important insights\ninto relativistic effects in nuclei and NM. However, the effective mean-field Lagrangian (Eq.7) is unlikely to have a simple physical meaning. The inverse masses\nof the vector and scalar fields correspond to lengths of \u223c 0.25 and 0.4 fm, which\nare much smaller than the unit radius r0 = (4\u03c0\u03c1/3)\u22121/3 \u223c 1.2 fm for equilibrium\nnuclear matter. The naive condition for the validity of the mean field approximation, that r0 be much less than the inverse masses of the fields is totally violated\nin nuclei as well as in neutron stars. Pions are omitted from the effective Lagrangian because they do not contribute to the energy of matter in the mean field\napproximation. Their higher order contributions are subsumed in the effective\nscalar field. Therefore, the effective mean-field Lagrangian must be interpreted\nas a relativistic generalization of Kohn's energy functional. Eq. (7) assumes the\nsimplest form necessary to fit nuclear data. A more general form, necessary to\nexplain the properties of NM over the wide density-asymmetry range in neutron\nstars, can have additional fields, isovector scalar for example, density dependent\ncoupling constants to take into account the changes in correlations with density,\nand field energies containing high powers of the fields, etc.\nThe energy of low density neutron matter is well determined by realistic models\nof two-nucleon interaction obtained by fitting the nucleon-nucleon (NN) scattering data. Different models and methods of calculation give very similar results\nup to \u03c1 \u223c \u03c10 , beyond which three-nucleon interactions and relativistic effects, as\nwell as computational difficulties may become appreciable. These energies thus\nprovide a test of the ability of the Skyrme and relativistic mean field theories to\nfind neutron matter properties by extrapolating data on nuclear binding energies,\nsizes, vibrations, etc. As shown in Fig.1, the neutron matter energies predicted\nby the various functionals are widely different, and not in agreement with the\nresults of many-body calculations at \u03c1 < \u03c10 . It thus appears likely that the\nsimple forms of effective interactions or Lagrangians used in the present mean\nfield theories are inadequate to predict the properties of neutron star matter by\nextrapolating the observed nuclear properties. Nevertheless, effective mean-field\nLagrangians have been widely used in neutron star studies due to their simplicity\n[43, 51].\n\n\f9\n\n3\n\nMany-Body Theory of Nucleon Matter\n\nMany properties of nuclei and nuclear matter can be understood from the Hamiltonian:\nX\nX\nX 1\n\u22072i +\nVijk + * * * ,\n(8)\nvij +\nH=\u2212\n2m\ni<j\ni\ni<j<k\nwhich includes the kinetic energy, two-nucleon interactions denoted by lower case\nv and three-nucleon interactions by capital V . The ellipsis denote neglected four\nand higher body interactions. In this section we review the present status of this\napproach and its limitations.\n\n3.1 Models of Two Nucleon Interaction\nOur understanding of QCD has not yet progressed enough to predict the twonucleon interaction vij ab initio. The long range part of vij is known to be\nmediated by pions, the lightest of all the mesons, and it is denoted by the one\npion exchange potential (OPEP) given by:\n2\nf\u03c0N\nN m\u03c0\nXij \u03c4 i * \u03c4 j ,\n4\u03c0\n3\n= Y\u03c0 (rij ) \u03c3 i * \u03c3 j + T\u03c0 (rij ) Sij .\n\n\u03c0\nvij\n=\n\nXij\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\n2\nThe pion-nucleon coupling constant f\u03c0N\nN /4\u03c0 = 0.075 \u00b1 0.002 [52], and the radial\nfunctions associated with the spin-spin and the tensor parts are:\n\nY\u03c0 (r) =\n\ne\u2212x\n\u03beY (r) ,\nx\n\n\u0012\n\nT\u03c0 (r) = 1 +\n\n3\n3\n+ 2 Y\u03c0 (r) \u03beT (r) ,\nx x\n\u0013\n\n(11)\n\nwhere x = m\u03c0 r. The tensor operator, Sij = 3 \u03c3 i * r\u0302ij \u03c3 j * r\u0302ij \u2212 \u03c3 i * \u03c3j , and since\n< 1 region, the OPEP is dominated by its tensor\nT\u03c0 (r) \u226b Y\u03c0 (r) in the important x\u223c\n\u03c0 + v R , where v R contains all the other,\npart. The complete vij is expressed as vij\nij\nij\nheavy meson, multiple meson and quark exchange parts. It has to be obtained\nalong with the short range cutoffs \u03beY (r) and \u03beT (r) in the OPEP by fitting NN\nscattering data. In boson-exchange models the v R is approximated by a sum of\nattractive scalar meson, and repulsive vector meson exchange potentials, while\nother models use attractive two-pion exchange and repulsive core potentials. The\nOPEP contains a \u03b4\u2212function term omitted from Eq.(10). Due to the finite size\nof nucleons this term acquires a finite range, and is difficult to separate from v R .\nIn the early 1990's the Nijmegen group [48] carefully examined all the data\non elastic NN scattering, at energies below the pion production threshold of\n\u223c 350 MeV, published between 1955 and 1992. They extracted 1787 protonproton and 2514 proton-neutron \"reliable\" data, and showed that these could\ndetermine all NN scattering phase shifts and mixing parameters quite accurately,\nthus claiming that the experimental information on elastic NN scattering is now\ncomplete. Additional measurements are being carried out at several laboratories\nincluding the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility, and the CELCIUS facility in\nUppsala, Sweden, to test the accuracy of the claim and improve on the quality\nof the data base. Nevertheless the Nijmegen analysis has been a major step.\nNN interaction models which fit the Nijmegen data base with a \u03c72 /Ndata \u223c 1\nare called \"modern\". These include the Nijmegen models [49] called Nijmegen I,\nII and Reid 93, the Argonne v18 [53] (A18) and CD-Bonn [54]. In order to fit\n\n\f10\nboth the proton-proton and neutron-proton scattering data simultaneously and\naccurately, these models include a detailed description of the electromagnetic\ninteractions and terms that violate the isospin symmetry of the strong interaction\nvia the differences in the masses of the charged and neutral pions, etc.\nR , and the Nijmegen-I\nThese five models use different parameterizations of the vij\nand CD-Bonn also include nonlocalities suggested by boson-exchange representations. Thus, like the older models, they make different predictions for the manybody systems. However, the differences in their predictions are much smaller\nthan those between older models, and can be partly understood.\nThe interaction in the spin-isospin T, S = 0, 1 has the largest model dependence, which gets carried over to the estimates of the energy of symmetric nuclear\nmatter (sec. 3.4). Fortunately the deuteron structure provides significant information on this interaction. Fig.2 shows the deuteron wave functions obtained\nwith the five modern potentials [55]. The three potentials, Reid 93, Nijmegen\nII and A18, which are local in each NN partial wave, give essentially the same\ndeuteron wave function. We expect that they will give rather similar matter\nproperties. The Nijmegen I and CD-Bonn potentials have momentum dependent terms associated with heavy meson exchange. These two potentials give\nlarger 3 S1 wave functions at r < 0.8 fm, because they have softer repulsive cores\nthan the local models; however, this effect is not very large as can be seen from\nFig.2. At r > 0.8 fm only the CD-Bonn predictions differ from the rest. This is\nbecause CD-Bonn has a strongly nonlocal OPEP as suggested by pseudoscalar\npion-nucleon coupling, which suppresses the 3 D1 wave function.\nThese results indicate that the main difference between the preset models of\nvij is from the assumed nonlocality in OPEP. However, relativistic field theories permit use of OPEP with different nonlocalities [56] related with the Dyson\ntransformation. The three-nucleon interaction, Vijk , depends upon the choice of\nOPEP [57], and the final results obtained after including it should be independent of the choice. Therefore, if relativistic field theories can be used to describe\npion exchange forces, one can use either the local OPEP in A18, or the nonlocal\none in CD-Bonn. In this case it may be better to use the local representation\nbecause it is simpler, and more accurate many-body calculations can be carried\nout with it.\nRealistic models of nuclear forces, the modern as well as the older, predict\nthe existence of a dense toroidal inner core in the deuteron [58]. The density\ndistribution, \u03c1(r\u2032 ), of the deuteron in spin projection M = 0 state, in the center\nof mass frame is shown in Fig.3. Here r\u2032 = \u00b1r/2 are the nucleon coordinates\nin the center of mass frame, and r is the internucleon distance. This density\ndistribution is symmetric under rotations about the Z \u2032 -axis, and the top part\nshows its cross section in the X \u2032 \u2212 Z \u2032 plane as predicted by the A18 model.\nThe bottom part shows the toroidal shape of the equi-density surface for half\nmaximum density. The density peaks on a ring of diameter of \u223c 1.0 fm inside\nthis torus having thickness of \u223c 0.8 fm. The shape is produced by constructive\n(destructive) interference between the S- and the D-wave functions shown in Fig.2\nalong the X \u2032 (Z \u2032 ) axis of the deuteron in the M = 0 state.\nThe dominant, static part of the vij in the deuteron, obtained by omitting the\nterms dependent on the angular momentum, is anisotropic due to the tensor part\nof the OPEP. It strongly depends upon the angle between the unit vector rij and\nthe spin directions. The expectation value of the interaction in the S = 1, MS = 0\n\n\f11\nstate, \u221a12 | \u2191\u2193 + \u2193\u2191i, is shown in Fig.4 as a function of rij for \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = \u03c0/2.\nThe interaction is attractive for \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 and repulsive for \u03b8 = 0, like that between\ntwo magnetic dipoles. The OPEP is also shown in Fig.4 by dashed lines. The\nNN interaction in all states except those with T, S = 1, 0 is dominated by the\nOPEP at rij > 1 fm. The OPEP is weakest in the T, S = 1, 0 states. At small\nR dominates in all states.\nrij the repulsive core of vij\nMost of the M = 0 deuteron wave function has also MS = 0. Thus it is possible\nto understand the density distribution of the deuteron from the potential shown\nin Fig.4. The two peaks in the density shown in Fig.3 correspond to the twonucleons in the deuteron being \u223c 1 fm apart at \u03b8 \u223c \u03c0/2 where the potential has\nits minimum value of \u223c \u2212200 MeV in the A18 model. Other models also have\na deep minimum at this position. The smallness of the density along the Z-axis\nis due to the repulsive potential at \u03b8 = 0. Even though these features existed\nin the potential models of the sixties their experimental confirmation came via\na series of measurements of the electromagnetic form factors of the deuteron up\nto momentum transfers of \u223c 8 fm\u22121 conducted since the mid eighties at SLAC\nand Bates. These and the more recent, high precision measurements [59, 60, 61]\ncarried out at the Jefferson Lab are in good agreement with the predictions of\nthe A18 model, and verify the predicted deuteron structure beyond r \u223c 0.7, or\nequivalently r \u2032 \u2265 0.35 fm.\nThe T, S = 1, 0 two-proton distribution functions, believed to be similar to\nthe two-neutron distribution functions due to isospin symmetry, are predicted\n[58] to have a dip at r \u223c 0 and a peak at r \u223c 1 fm, due to the repulsive core\nand the minima of vN N respectively. The experimental information on these\nspherically symmetric distribution functions is less direct. It comes from sums\nof longitudinal response functions of light nuclei [62]. The sums observed in 3 He\nand 4 He are in fair agreement with theory, and show evidence of the predicted\nstructure, however, the relativistic and other corrections to the observed sums\nare significant.\nThe observed deuteron form factors and, to a lesser extent, the sums of longitudinal response of light nuclei indicate that the modern two-nucleon potentials\nand the wave functions they predict have validity at internucleon distances larger\nthan \u223c 0.7 fm. This may appear surprising because the rms charge radius of the\nproton is known to be 0.8 fm. However, the nucleons seem to have a small and\ndense core. The charge form factor of the proton, as well as the magnetic form factors of the proton and neutron are well approximated by the dipole (1 + q 2 /q02 )\u22122\nwith q0 = 840 MeV/c. Inverting this form factor gives the proton charge density\nas \u03c1pch (r) = 3.3 e\u2212r/0.23f m fm\u22123 . The charge densities of two protons, one fm\napart are shown in Fig.5. It should be noted that the charge densities shown\ncan have corrections due to the neglect of relativistic effects in inverting the form\n< 1/m \u223c 0.21 fm, and that recent measurements of the proton form\nfactor at r \u223c\n> 4 fm\u22121 . They\nfactor [63] show deviations from the dipole form at momenta \u223c\nsuggest that proton charge density flattens out at r < 0.3 fm. Nevertheless Fig.\n5 indicates that nucleons a fm apart can retain their identities. The NN interaction includes the change in the energy due to their overlap, and it has minima\nnear r \u223c 1 fm. In absence of the quantum kinetic energy term (\u2212\u22072 /2m) in the\nHamiltonian (Eq.8) the deuteron will shrink to a ring of radius \u223c 0.5 fm, and the\nequilibrium density of nuclear matter will be \u223c 1 fm\u22123 . The density of matter\nin most neutron stars is less than that.\n\n\f12\n\n3.2 Models of Three Nucleon Interaction\nAll realistic models of vij , the modern and the older, underbind the triton and\nother light nuclei and predict too high equilibrium density for symmetric nuclear\nmatter. In both cases the deviation from experiment is not too large, particularly\nwhen compared with the expectation values of vij . For example, the expectation\nvalue hvi<j i in 3 H is about \u223c \u221250 MeV, while the underbinding is by < 1 MeV.\nIt is likely that these differences are due to three-nucleon interactions expected\nand predicted since the fifties [64].\nHigh precision modeling of the two-nucleon interaction is possible because scattering cross sections can be easily and exactly calculated from the assumed vij ,\nand a complete set of \u223c 4000 cross sections has been measured. Such an approach is not practical at present for the three-nucleon interaction Vijk . In principle deuteron-nucleon scattering and reactions can be used to study Vijk in the\nisospin T = 1/2 state. However, this scattering is dominated by the two-nucleon\ninteraction [65], and very high precision data is necessary to extract the effects\nof Vijk , as is being attempted in new experiments at the Indiana University cyclotron, focused on spin observables.\nThe large hvi<j i is cancelled to a large extent by the kinetic energy in nuclear\nbinding energies. Thus hVi<j<k i in nuclei is expected to be of the order of 10\n% of their binding energy. Hence we can construct realistic models of Vijk by\nfitting binding energies of light nuclei, which can now be calculated with an accuracy of the order of 1 % using Greens Function Monte Carlo (GFMC) methods\n[66, 67] and the estimated equilibrium properties of nuclear matter. As will be\ndiscussed in sec. 3.7, it is not yet possible to calculate the EOS of symmetric\nnuclear matter with comparable accuracy. The models depend upon the vij used\nin the Hamiltonian. This is inevitable, because unitary transformations make\ncorrelated changes in vij and Vijk [57]. Only the combinations of vij and Vijk in\nthe Hamiltonian (8) are meaningful.\nThe information contained in nuclear binding energies and equilibrium properties of nuclear matter is limited. Therefore the realistic models of Vijk rely\non theory to a much larger extent than the models of vij , and contain very few\nparameters. The Urbana models of Vijk contain two isoscalar terms:\n2\u03c0\nR\nVijk = Vijk\n+ Vijk\n.\n\n(12)\n\nThe first term represents the Fujita-Miyazawa [64] two-pion exchange interaction:\n1\nA2\u03c0 {\u03c4 i * \u03c4 j , \u03c4 i * \u03c4 k } {Xij , Xik } + [\u03c4 i * \u03c4 j , \u03c4 i * \u03c4 k ][Xij , Xik ] ,\n4\ncyc\n(13)\nwith strength denoted by A2\u03c0 . The functions T\u03c0 (rij ) and Y\u03c0 (rij ) in Xij , Eq.(10),\nare taken from the A18 model of vij . This interaction is due to the pion exchanged\nby nucleons j and k being scattered by the nucleon i via the \u2206 resonance in \u03c0N scattering. In classical terms it is due to the polarization of the quark spins\nin nucleon i, due to the pion field of j (k), interacting with k (j); and it is\nsimilar to the three-body earth-moon-satellite gravitational interaction due to\nthe polarization of the ocean water on earth by the moon's gravity.\nR is purely phenomenological, and has the form:\nThe Vijk\n2\u03c0\nVijk\n=\n\nX\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\nR\nVijk\n= U0\n\nX\ncyc\n\nT\u03c02 (rij )T\u03c02 (rik ).\n\n(14)\n\n\f13\nTable 1: Results of Quantum Monte Carlo Calculations in MeV\nAZ\n2H\n3H\n4 He\n6 He\n6 Li\n7 He\n7 Li\n8 He\n8 Li\n8 Be\n\n(J \u03c0 ; T )\n(1+ ; 0)\n+\n( 12 ; 21 )\n(0+ ; 0)\n(0+ ; 1)\n(1+ ; 0)\n\u2212\n( 23 ; 23 )\n\u2212\n( 23 ; 21 )\n(0+ ; 2)\n(2+ ; 1)\n(0+ ; 0)\n\n\u03c0\nvij\n-21.3\n-43.8\n-99.4\n-109\n-129\n-110\n-153\n-121\n-157\n-224\n\n2\u03c0\nVijk\n0\n-2.2\n-11.7\n-13.6\n-13.5\n-14.1\n-17.1\n-15.8\n-22.2\n-28.1\n\nR\nvij\n-0.8\n-14.6\n-36.0\n-56\n-50\n-61\n-68\n-74\n-104\n-72\n\nR\nVijk\n0\n1.0\n5.3\n6.4\n6.3\n6.7\n8.2\n7.5\n11.0\n13.3\n\nEGF M C\n-2.22\n-8.47\n-28.30\n-27.64\n-31.25\n-25.2\n-37.4\n-25.8\n-38.3\n-54.7\n\n\u2206Eexpt.\n0\n-0.01(1)\n0.00(2)\n-1.63(14)\n-0.74(11)\n-3.7(2)\n-1.8(3)\n-5.6(6)\n-3.0(6)\n-1.8(6)\n\n\u2206EV M C\n0\n0.15\n0.52\n2.8\n3.2\n4.7\n4.7\n6.1\n8.6\n6.6\n\nIt was meant to represent the modification of the two-pion exchange part of\nvij by other particles in matter, however, \u223c 40 % of it is due to relativistic\neffects discussed in the next subsection. The parameters of the present model\nU-IX, A2\u03c0 = \u22120.0293 MeV and U0 = 0.0048 MeV, have been determined from\nexact GFMC calculations of 3 H and approximate variational calculations of the\nequilibrium density of nuclear matter with the A18 NN interaction [68].\nThe results of essentially exact GFMC calculations [66, 67] with the A18 and\nU-IX interactions are shown in Table-1. We note that the better known pion\nexchange parts of these interactions give the largest contributions, but the conR and V R , are significant. The column\ntributions of the phenomenological parts, vij\nijk\n\u2206Eexpt gives the difference between the experimental energies and the calculated,\nwhile \u2206EV M C is that between the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) upper bounds\nand the exact GFMC energies.\nTable-1 shows that the U-IX interaction underbinds A = 8 nuclei, and since\n8 He is more underbound than 8 Be, it misrepresents the isospin dependence of\nVijk . The new Illinois models of Vijk [69] resolve this problem by including the\n3\u03c0 , that is attractive in triplets having isospin\nleading three-pion exchange term, Vijk\nT = 3/2, but has little effect on the T = 1/2 triplets in 3 H and 4 He. A much\nimproved fit, with errors < 2%, to the observed energies is obtained as shown in\n2\u03c0 ,\nFig.6. The three parameters in Pieper's model IL-2R are the strengths of the Vijk\nR and V 3\u03c0 . Calculations of NM properties with this more accurate V\nVijk\nijk are in\nijk\nprogress; the preliminary results are similar to those with U-IX since the V 3\u03c0 is\n2\u03c0 ,\nmuch weaker than the V 2\u03c0 and V R . For example, the expectation values of Vijk\nR\n3\u03c0\n8\n8\nVijk and Vijk of IL-2R model, in Be ( He) are respectively \u223c \u221238 (\u221227), +19\n(+14) and \u22122 (\u22125) MeV. In the following sections we will review the properties\nof neutron star matter calculated with A18 and U-IX interactions.\nIn principle there can be four-nucleon interactions (FNI) neglected in the\nHamiltonian (Eq.8). It seems that they are very weak in nuclei. All the models\nof Vijk studied so far reproduce the energy of 4 He with an error < 0.5%, after\nfitting the observed energy of 3 H. Since this error is close to the accuracy of the\n4 He calculation, there is no indication of FNI in that nucleus. The IL-2R model\nalso gives the experimental energies of A = 8 nuclei within \u223c 1 MeV. In 8 Be, for\nexample, the expectation values of vij and Vijk are respectively \u2212308 and \u221221\nMeV respectively. By comparison with experiment we estimate that the possi-\n\n\f14\nble contribution of FNI in this nucleus is < 1 MeV. The Vijk presumably has\nadditional smaller terms neglected in IL-2R, but it is difficult to determine their\nstrengths from the nuclear spectra that can be calculated accurately from bare\nforces at present.\n\n3.3 Relativistic Boost Interaction\nIn all models, the NN scattering data is reduced to the center of mass frame and\nfitted using phase shifts calculated from the NN interaction, vij , in that frame.\nThe vij obtained by this procedure describes the interaction between nucleons\nhaving total momentum Pij = pi + pj = 0. In general, the interaction between\nparticles depends on their momenta pi and pj . For example the electromagnetic\ninteraction [70] between two particles of mass m and charge Q, contains a term\nwith the factor \u2212pi *pj /2m2 = p2ij /2m2 \u2212 Pij2 /8m2 , where pij = (pi \u2212 pj )/2 is the\nrelative momentum. The terms containing pij are included in the momentumdependent parts of vij , while the boost interaction \u03b4v(Pij ) contains parts dependent on the total Pij . Even though contributions of the boost interaction to the\nbinding energy of SNM and 3 H were estimated by Coester and coworkers in the\nseventies and eighties [71, 72], they were first included in studies of dense matter\nrather recently [73]. Walecka's relativistic mean field theory naturally contains\nthe boost interactions [74].\nFollowing the work of Krajcik and Foldy, Friar [75] obtained the following\nequation relating the boost interaction of order P 2 to the interaction in the center\nof mass frame:\n\u03b4v(P) = \u2212\n\n1\n1\nP2\nv+\n[P * r P * \u2207, v] +\n[(\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3j ) \u00d7 P * \u2207, v].\n2\n2\n8m\n8m\n8m2\n\n(15)\n\nThe general validity of this equation in relativistic mechanics and field theory\nwas recently demonstrated [74]. Including boost interaction, the nonrelativistic\nHamiltonian assumes the form:\nH\u2217 =\n\nX p2\ni\n\n2m\n\n+\n\nX\n\n(vij + \u03b4v(Pij )) +\n\nX\n\n\u2217\nVijk\n+ ***,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere the ellipsis denotes the three-body boost, and four and higher body interactions. This H \u2217 contains all terms quadratic in the particle velocities, and is\ntherefore suitable for complete studies in the nonrelativistic limit.\nStudies of light nuclei using the VMC method [76, 77] find that the contribution\nof the two-body boost interaction to the energy is repulsive, with a magnitude\nR in the UIX model. The boost interaction thus acwhich is \u223c 37% of that of Vijk\nR in Hamiltonians which fit nuclear energies\ncounts for a significant part of the Vijk\n\u2217 in Eq.(16) has a V R of appropriately smaller strength\nneglecting \u03b4v. The Vijk\nthan that in the Vijk in Hamiltonian H given by Eq.(8).\nWe should expect additional relativistic corrections to the Hamiltonian (16).\nHowever, when nonrelativistic potentials are fit to the experimental data, relativistic effects present in the data are automatically buried in these potentials. In\norder to study the magnitude of a chosen relativistic correction, such as that due\nto the approximation of the kinetic energy or the boost interaction, or the nonlocalities of OPEP, it is necessary to refit the same data set, fitted to obtain the\nnonrelativistic Hamiltonian, and then study the differences. Such comparisons\n[77] indicate that the relativistic corrections associated with kinetic energies and\n\n\f15\nnonlocalities of OPEP are small, whereas the boost corrections are significant.\nThis is not surprising since the boost interaction was totally omitted from the\nconventional nonrelativistic nuclear Hamiltonian (Eq.8).\n\n3.4 Brueckner Calculations of Nucleon Matter\nCalculating the properties of matter from the interaction vij between pairs of its\nconstituents is a well known problem in many-body theory. It is particularly challenging for NM due to the strong spin-isospin dependence of vij . In the method\ndeveloped by Brueckner, Bethe and Goldstone the perturbation expansion of the\nenergy of NM is cast into a series ordered according to the number of independent hole lines (HL). This method has been used extensively since the sixties [78]\nto study symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) and nuclei. It was also used then to\npredict properties of pure neutron matter (PNM) [79] soon after the discovery\nof pulsars. The convergence of the expansion depends upon the choice of the\nsingle-particle energies in the assumed unperturbed Hamiltonian. For the hole\nstates with momenta less than kF , they are chosen self consistently as suggested\nby Brueckner and Gammel [80] via the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) procedure. The older calculations by Day [81] used kinetic energies for particle states.\nSince this leads to a discontinuity in the unperturbed single-particle energies at\nkF , Day's choice is called \"discontinuous\". In 1976 the Li\u00e8ge group [36] advocated the \"continuous\" choice by extending the definition of BHF single-particle\nenergies to particle states. If all the higher order terms of the HL expansion are\ncomputed the final results should be independent of the choice.\nDetailed calculations of SNM have been carried out with the older Argonne\nv14 interaction by the Catania group [82] using both choices. The results of the\nlowest order 2-HL calculation depend significantly on the choice, however, those\nincluding 2+3-HL terms are almost the same for the two choices. They find that\nthe 2-HL results with the continuous (discontinuous) choice are \u223c 15 % below (30\n% above) those of the 2+3. Day's calculations [81], with the same interaction,\ninclude additional 4-HL terms, and give energies below the 2+3 Catania results,\ncloser to the 2-HL continuous. For example, the energies of SNM at \u03c1 = 0.28 fm\u22123\nare \u221211.3, \u221216.1, \u221218.3 and \u221217.8\u00b11.3 for the Catania 2-HL discontinuous, 2+3HL, 2-HL continuous, and Day's calculations respectively, while the variational\nupper bound at this density is \u221216.2 \u00b1 0.4 [81] with the methods described in\nthe next subsection. The size of the error due to truncation of the expansion is\nestimated in Day's and variational calculations.\nA significant advantage of Brueckner's method is that it can be easily applied\nto local as well as nonlocal modern interactions. The present calculations, called\nlowest-order BHF (LOBHF), include only the 2-HL terms and use the continuous\nchoice [83]. Their results for PNM and SNM are shown in Fig.7; those for matter\nwith intermediate values of proton fraction can be estimated from these by interpolating with \u03b2 2 as metioned in sec. 2. These results provide an estimate of the\nuncertainty in the predicted matter energy due to that in the NN interaction.\nThe LOBHF energies for neutron matter are essentially model independent up\nto \u223c 0.3 fm\u22123 (Fig.7); at higher densities they deviate partly for the following\nreason. All the models fit the NN scattering data up to 350 MeV lab energy, i.e.\nup to maximum relative momenta k = 2.05 fm\u22121 . The maximum value of the\nrelative momentum of two hole states in matter is kF , and the density of PNM\n(SNM) at kF = 2.05 is 0.29 (0.58) fm\u22123 . In PNM at \u03c1 > 0.29 the interactions\n\n\f16\nare being used at relative momenta larger than in the fitted data. Baldo et al\n[84] have shown that the 3 P2 phase shifts predicted by the five modern potentials\n\u22121\nvary from 8 (A18)\naverage\np to 19 (Nijmegen II) degrees at k = 3 fm . The\nvalue, krms = 3/10 kF , is smaller than kF , and exceeds 2.05 fm\u22121 at much\nlarger densities of 1.77 (3.54) fm\u22123 of PNM (SNM). Presumably, this helps to\nkeep down the model dependence.\nThe LOBHF energies of SNM have a larger model dependence starting at lower\ndensities (Fig.7). Here the main cause seems to be the assumed nonlocality of\nvij discussed in sec. 3.1. The local interactions, Nijmegen II, Ried 93 and A18\ngive similar results, while the most nonlocal CD-Bonn gives the lowest energies.\nThe predicted values of equilibrium \u03c10 and E0 of SNM are respectively 0.31, 0.27,\n0.28, 0.27 and 0.37 fm\u22123 and \u221220.3, \u221217.6, \u221218.7, \u221218.1 and \u221222.9 MeV with\nNijmegen I, II, Reid93, A18 and CD Bonn interactions; while the empirical values\nare 0.16 fm\u22123 and \u221216 MeV. Obviously, the empirical properties of P\nSNM can not\nbe obtained by approximating the nuclear interaction energy by\nvi<j . TNI,\nadded to the Hamiltonian to obtain the observed properties, naturally depend\nupon the choice of vij . For example, those to be added to CD Bonn have to\nhave stronger repulsive parts, which dominate at large \u03c1. The combinations of\nvij +Vijk , constrained with experimental data, will have smaller model dependence\nthan seen in Fig.7.\nBaldo, Bombaci and Burgio [85] have carried out LOBHF calculations with\nthe older Paris and Argonne interactions including Urbana TNI. Like the modern\nmodels, these older models give too large \u03c10 (\u223c 0.26 fm\u22123 ) and E0 (\u223c \u221218 MeV)\nin LOBHF without TNI. By averaging over the position of the third nucleon the\nTNI is expressed as a density dependent NN interaction to be added to the vij .\nThe parameters A2\u03c0 and U0 were chosen to get closer to the empirical values of\n\u03c10 and E0 ; their values of \u22120.0329 and 0.00361 MeV are not too far from those\nof U-IX (\u22120.0293 and 0.0048). With the Paris + Urbana model they obtain\n\u03c10 = 0.176 fm\u22123 , E0 = \u221216.0 MeV, K = 281 MeV, and Esym = 33 MeV. These\nvalues, as well as those obtained using the Argonne interaction instead of Paris,\ncompare rather well with the empirical values given in sec. 2.\nRelativistic effects are included in the LOBHF calculations via Dirac-Brueckner\napproximation suggested by Celenza and Shakin [86]. The calculations include\ncontributions of the boost interactions as well as TNI [87], and many nucleon\ninteractions generated via the Z-graphs containing anti-nucleon lines. However,\nthey do not contain contributions of the Fujita-Miyazawa and other TNI due to\ninternal structure of nucleons. Results have been reported by Brockmann and\nMachleidt [88] for the older Bonn meson exchange NN interaction models; those\nwith the Bonn-A model come close to reproducing the empirical properties of\nSNM at \u03c10 .\n\n3.5 Variational Calculations of Nucleon Matter\nVariational calculations of NM with realistic interactions have been carried out\nsince 1970 [89]. The present calculations [68, 73] use variational wave-functions,\n\u03a8v , consisting of a symmetrized product of pair correlation operators, Fij , operating on the Fermi gas wave-function. In PNM, the Fij include four terms\ngenerating spatial, \u03c3 i * \u03c3 j , tensor and spin orbit correlations. The SNM Fij have\neight terms; the additional four have \u03c4 i * \u03c4 j factors.\nThis wave-function is clearly too simple to accurately describe the ground state\n\n\f17\nof nuclear matter. Monte Carlo studies of few-body nuclei use additional threebody correlations induced by both vij and Vijk , in the variational wave-function;\nthey reduce the energy of 16 O by \u223c 1 MeV/nucleon. The results shown in Table.1 indicate that the VMC energies of A = 8 nuclei, obtained after including three-body correlation operators, are above the exact GFMC values by \u223c 1\nMeV/nucleon. From these we estimate that the present \u03a8v may underbind SNM\nby a few MeV. In contrast, the three-body correlations have a smaller effect on\nthe energy of pure neutron drops [90]. The variational energy of a drop with\neight neutrons, calculated with the simple \u03a8v , is greater than the exact value\nby \u223c 0.5 MeV/nucleon. Thus the variational energies are relatively more accurate for PNM than for SNM. This is as expected, since SNM has much stronger\ntensor correlations. Despite the aforementioned shortcomings, the simple \u03a8v\nhaving only pair correlation operators describes the gross features of the nuclear\nwave-function rather well. For example, the spin-isospin dependent two-nucleon\ndistribution functions calculated in this approximation are close to the exact\ndistribution functions [66].\nThe correlation operators Fij are determined from Euler-Lagrange equations\nthat minimize the two-body cluster contribution of an interaction v\u0304ij \u2212 \u03bbij . The\ninteraction v\u0304ij is related to the vij via a parameter \u03b1 meant to simulate the\nquenching of the spin-isospin interaction between particles i and j, via their interaction with other particles in matter. The operator \u03bbij simulates screening\neffects in matter; it is determined from the ranges dt of tensor correlations, and\ndc of all the other correlations. The \u03a8v thus depend on three variational parameters: \u03b1, dc and dt , determined by minimizing the energy. Two additional\nparameters are used in Ref.[91] to further lower the variational upper bound by\nsmall amounts.\nThe energy expectation value is evaluated using cluster expansion. The onebody term is just the Fermi gas kinetic energy, and the large two-body (2B)\nterm, analogous to the interaction energy in LOBHF, is calculated exactly. The\nmost important of the many-body (MB) cluster contributions are summed using\nFermi-hypernetted chain (FHNC) and single operator chain equations [68, 73],\nand constrains are imposed to satisfy the fundamental identities of pair distribution functions. The kinetic energy can be calculated using different expressions related by integration by parts. If all MB contributions are calculated,\nthese expressions yield the same result. However, they yield different results\nwhen only selected parts of the MB clusters are summed using chain equations.\nStudies of atomic helium liquids with FHNC summation methods find the exact\nresult to be between the energies obtained using the Jackson-Feenberg (JF) and\nPandharipande-Bethe (PB) expressions. The average of these two is used as the\nresult with half the difference as an estimate of the error.\nMore general pair correlations can be calculated by separately minimizing the\ntwo-body cluster contribution to each partial wave, specified by l, S, J and the\nrelative momentum k [92]. These correlations f (l, S, J, k) depend on all the quantum numbers, and yield a lower 2B energy than the Fij operator with the same\n\u03b1, dc and dt . The MB contributions cannot be easily calculated with the general\nf (l, S, J, k), however. The differences between optimum f (l, S, J, k) and Fij can\nbe included via the second order two-particle, two-hole contribution, \u2206E2 , in\ncorrelated basis perturbation theory [35, 93]. In recent calculations [68, 73] the\n\u2206E2 is approximated by the difference \u03b4E2B between the 2B cluster energies calculated using f (l, S, J, k) and Fij . However, the values of \u03b1, dc , dt are determined\n\n\f18\nby minimizing the energy calculated from the Fij .\nThe variational [73] and LOBHF energies obtained with the A18 interaction\nare compared in Fig.8. At densities below 0.6 fm\u22123 there is fairly close agreement\nbetween them, however, we expect the true results to be a few MeV below the\nvariational upper bound. At higher densities the SNM LOBHF energy is significantly below the variational bound. The convergence of the HL expansion is\nexpected to deteriorate at higher densities, and it may be the cause of the large\ndifference.\n\n3.6 Neutral Pion Condensation\nVariational calculations with the Hamiltonian (16) with A18+\u03b4v+UIX\u2217 interactions, indicate the occurrence of a phase transition in both PNM and SNM; the\nenergies of the two phases are shown in Fig.9. The tensor correlations have a\nlonger range in the higher density phase (HDP) than in the low density phase\n(LDP). Detailed studies of the pion fields in the two phases [68] indicate that\nthe HDP has a large enhancement of virtual neutral pions with momenta \u223c 1.5\nfm\u22121 , and therefore this transition is believed to be due to neutral pion condensation in matter. Although the effect of this type of transition on the EOS is\nrelatively small, it can have important consequences for the cooling and evolution\nof neutron stars [21].\nSince the pioneering work of Migdal [94] and of Sawyer and Scallapino [95],\nmany investigators have used effective interactions to study the possibility of\npion condensation in SNM and PNM. These efforts were recently reviewed by\nKunihiro et al [96]. Neutral pion condensation occurs when PNM (SNM) becomes unstable towards the development of a spin (spin-isospin) density wave as\ndiscussed in sec. 4.2. The variational wave functions used in the Urbana calculations [68] are not adequate to describe the long range order expected with \u03c0 0 condensation; better calculations may be possible with the quantum Monte Carlo\nmethod described in the next subsection. NM with spin or spin-isospin density\nwave naturally has a pion field of the same wavelength; it causes N \u21c0\n\u21bd \u2206 transitions, which help lower the energy of this phase. The effects of the \u2206-resonance\nare absorbed into the interactions in the Hamiltonian (16). In particular, the\n2\u03c0 has a large effect on \u03c0 0 condensation. Without it there is\nFujita-Miyazawa Vijk\nno condensation predicted in SNM, while that in PNM occurs at a higher density\nof \u223c 0.5 fm\u22123 .\nThis transition was found by Wiringa, Fiks and Fabrocini to occur with the\nolder Argonne v14 for PNM but not for SNM [91], while it does not occur in either\nPNM or SNM with the Urbana v14 interaction of 1981. In Migdal's approach [94],\nthe transition of SNM to the pion condensed phase is inhibited by a positive,\nshort-range \u03c3 i * \u03c3 j \u03c4 i * \u03c4 j NN interaction whose strength is represented by the\nLandau parameter g \u2032 . In the case of PNM the sum of the \u03c3 i * \u03c3 j and \u03c3 i * \u03c3 j \u03c4 i * \u03c4 j\ninteractions occurs since \u03c4 i * \u03c4 j = 1. The contact part of OPEP gives a negative\n\u03c3i * \u03c3 j \u03c4 i * \u03c4 j potential at small r, and thus favors pion condensation. The \u03c3i *\n\u03c3j \u03c4 i * \u03c4 j part of the modern A18 NN interaction does become negative at small\nr, however, it is positive in the older Urbana-Argonne models which do not fit\nthe NN scattering data as well as the A18.\nThe energies of \u03b2-stable LDP and HDP phases have been calculated by interpolation between PNM and SNM [73]. The LDP phase with \u03c1 = 0.204 fm\u22123\nand proton fraction xp = 0.073 is found to be in equilibrium with the HDP at\n\n\f19\n\u03c1 = 0.237 and xp = 0.057. In between there will be mixed phase regions as\ndiscussed in sec. 5.\n\n3.7 Quantum Monte Carlo Calculations\nThe variational energy of the ground state of SNM, calculated with the A18+\u03b4v+UIX\u2217\nmodel is \u223c \u221212 MeV, against the empirical value of \u221216 MeV. As mentioned earlier, this difference is believed to be mostly due to the inadequacy of the present\nvariational wave functions. Accurate calculations of the energies of many-body\nsystems in which the interactions do not depend upon the spins of the particles have been carried out using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods [97].\nIn these systems one can work with a wave function \u03a6(R) that depends only\nupon the positions of all the particles represented by the configuration vector\nR = r1 , r2 , ...rA . A VMC calculation is used to obtain a good approximation\n\u03a6v (R), and in the GFMC method one operates on \u03a6v (R) with the imaginary\ntime evolution operator exp(\u2212[H \u2212 E0 ]\u03c4 ) to project out the exact ground state\n\u03a60 (R).\nThe main difficulty in applying QMC methods to nuclear problems is that\nnuclear forces change spins and isospins of the interacting nucleons, and thus\nnuclear wave functions contain superpositions of all possible spin-isospin states\nof A-nucleons. Their number, \u223c 2A A!/[Z!(A \u2212 Z)!], increases very rapidly with\nA. For this reason exact QMC calculations have been carried out only for nuclei\nhaving up to 8 nucleons [67, 69], and attempts to calculate A = 9 nuclei are in\nprogress. Carlson [98] has also calculated the ground states of 14 neutrons in a\nperiodic box. Calculations of pure neutron systems are simpler because there is\nonly one isospin state, and all \u03c4 i * \u03c4 j can be replaced by the unit operator.\nIn addition, GFMC calculations of Fermion systems suffer from the \"Fermion\nsign problem\". The real wave functions of simple Fermi systems have nodal surfaces because the \u03a6(R) must equal \u2212\u03a6(R\u2032 ) when the configurations R and R\u2032 are\nrelated by the exchange of a pair of particles. GFMC configurations which diffuse\nacross nodal surfaces, as the system evolves in imaginary time, increase the variance of the calculated quantity, making unconstrained propagation impractical\nfor large systems. In the fixed node method [99] for simple systems this growth\nof variance is eliminated by restricting the configurations to domains enclosed by\nthe nodal surfaces of the variational wave function. Such calculations generally\nhave an error due to imperfections in that structure, but it is much smaller than\nthat in variational.\nA similar problem comes in nuclear GFMC with the additional complexity\ndue to nuclear wave functions having many spin-isospin components, each with\na different nodal structure. The growth of the variance is tolerable for A \u2264\n7, but when A \u2265 8 it is necessary to use constrained path methods [67] to\ncontrol the variance. The constraint can be removed at large \u03c4 to test if it\ninfluenced the calculated energy significantly. It appears that calculations with\n\u223c 2% accuracy in the binding energy are possible in this way for systems having\nup to 14 neutrons.\nAuxiliary field diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC) [100] seems to be the longsought breakthrough needed to eliminate the exponential (2A ) growth of spin\nstates in GFMC calculations of neutron matter. This method combines two major\nthemes in QMC. Auxiliary-field methods are used in the shell model Monte Carlo\ncalculations [101], and several condensed matter systems in which the continuous\n\n\f20\nspatial degrees of freedom have been eliminated, while diffusion Monte Carlo is\nanother name for GFMC.\nIn the approach developed by Schmidt and Fantoni [100], the spatial parts,\n(i.e. kinetic energy and spin-independent interactions), of the Hamiltonian are\npropagated as in GFMC and the spin-dependent interactions between neutrons\nare replaced by interactions of neutrons with auxiliary fields. Integrating over the\nauxiliary fields reproduces the original spin-dependent interaction. In addition, a\nconstraint analogous to the fixed-node approximation in GFMC is introduced, by\nrequiring that the real part of the overlap with a trial function remains positive.\nMore recently, Schmidt and Fantoni [102] have carried out calculations with a\nrealistic Hamiltonian consisting of Argonne v8\u2032 NN interaction used in the GFMC\ncalculations [66], and the UIX TNI. The v8\u2032 contains the main parts of A18, and\nthe difference between the two is treated perturbatively. Results of calculations\nwith 38 neutrons in a periodic box with finite size corrections have been obtained. They are \u223c 5% below the variational energies obtained with the methods\ndescribed above. For example, the AFDMC and variational energies for Argonne\nv8\u2032 and UIX interactions are 21.8 \u00b10.1 (65.5 \u00b10.1) and 23.2 (68.6) MeV per neutron at \u03c1 = 0.2 (0.4) fm\u22123 .\nThe trial functions used to constrain the present AFDMC calculations are\nrather simple without any spin correlations. In contrast it is possible to use\nmore accurate variational wave functions with spin correlations to constrain the\nGFMC calculations. Carlson [98] has compared AFDMC and GFMC results for\n14 neutrons in a periodic box. At \u03c1 = 0.15 fm\u22123 the GFMC energy (220 \u00b1\n1) is about 7 % below the AFDMC result of 236.4 \u00b1 1.5 MeV. From these we\nconclude that the variational PNM energies given in the last section may be \u223c 12\n% above the exact values for the A18 and UIX interactions. The error in SNM\nE(\u03c1) is probably twice as large. As mentioned in the conclusions (sect.7), an\noverestimation of the E(\u03c1) of neutron matter by 12 % has a rather small effect\non the predictions of neutron star properties.\nThe AFDMC is more accurate than the present variational method, and it is\nalso more versatile. For example, it can be used to study matter with long range\nspin-isospin order induced by \u03c0 0 -condensation discussed in sect 4.2.\n\n4\n\nHadronic and Quark Matter\n\nIt is likely that at high densities more general form of matter containing hadrons\nbesides the nucleons, called hadronic matter (HM), has lower energy. The possibilities are that it contains negatively charged mesons like pions or kaons, or\nother hyperons such as \u03a3\u2212 or \u039b. Finally, it is expected that at a high enough\ndensity there will be a transition to quark matter (QM) in which the quarks are\nnot clustered into nucleons or hadrons.\nThe interactions between hyperons and nucleons, and between kaons and nucleons are not as well known as those between nucleons, and the energy of quark\nmatter is difficult to calculate realistically. Therefore the transition densities from\nNM to HM or QM are rather difficult to calculate reliably. We review the recent\nestimates.\n\n\f21\n\n4.1 Kaon Condensation\nKaon condensation in dense matter was suggested by Kaplan and Nelson [103],\nand has been discussed in many recent publications [104, 105]. Due to the attraction between K \u2212 and nucleons the kaon energy decreases with increasing density,\nand eventually if it drops below the electron chemical potential in NM, a Bose\ncondensate of K \u2212 will appear. The key quantities of interest are the electron and\nkaon chemical potentials in NM. The former is obtained from the \u03b2-equilibrium\ncondition, \u03bce = \u03bcn \u2212 \u03bcp relating electron, neutron and proton chemical potentials. The \u03bce obtained from the A18+\u03b4v+UIX\u2217 interactions with variational\ncalculations is shown in Fig.10.\nIn neutron matter at very low densities, the interparticle spacing is much larger\nthan the range of the K \u2212 n interaction, and the kaon interacts many times with\nthe same nucleon before it encounters and interacts with another nucleon. Therefore one can use the scattering length, aK \u2212 n , as the \"effective\" kaon-nucleon interaction. In this low density limit the kaon energy deviates from its rest mass\nby the Lenz potential, and is given by [106] :\n\u03c9Lenz = mK +\n\n2\u03c0\na \u2212 \u03c1,\nmR K n\n\n(17)\n\nwhere mR = mK mn /(mK + mn ) is the kaon-neutron reduced mass. The scattering length extracted from data is (\u22120.37 \u2212 i0.57) fm; its imaginary part is due\nto the open \u039b \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 channel in vacuum. In the density region of interest to kaon\ncondensation the kaon energy is too small for the K \u2212 + n \u2192 \u039b + \u03c0 \u2212 reaction to\noccur. Using effective lagrangians based on chiral perturbation theory Brown et.\nal. [104] estimate aK \u2212 n to be \u22120.41 fm in absence of reaction channels.\nThere are two corrections to the Lenz energy at small densities. Including\nthese, the kaon energy \u03c9 obtains the form [105, 106]:\n\u03c9 = mK +\n\n\u0012\n\n2mK\nmK + \u03c9\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n1\n1 \u2212 aK \u2212 n \u03be\u03c1\n\n\u0013\n\n2\u03c0\na \u2212 \u03c1,\nmR K n\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03be\u03c1 is the inverse correlation length. The first correction factor is a relativistic effect obtained from the Klein-Gordon equation, while the second factor\nis from the theory developed by Ericson and Ericson for propagation of mesons\nin nuclear matter. The relativistic correction decreases the kaon energy, while\nthe correlation correction increases it.\nAs the density increases further, and the interparticle spacing becomes of the\norder of the range of the interaction, the kaon will simultaneously interact with\ntwo or more nucleons and the Lenz approximation will break down. In the high\ndensity limit the kaon energy deviates from its rest mass by the Hartree potential:\n\u03c9Hartree = mK + \u03c1\n\nZ\n\nvK \u2212 n (r)d3 r ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere vK \u2212 n is the K \u2212 n interaction potential. As shown in Ref. [107], the\nHartree potential is considerably less attractive than the Lenz potential and thus\n\u03c9Hartree > \u03c9Lenz . The transition from the Lenz to Hartree limits has been recently studied [106] with a variety of methods including exact calculations for\nsimple cubic crystal model of neutron matter. For reasonable interaction range\nthe transition begins at very low densities (< 0.1\u03c10 ), and the Hartree limit is\nessentially reached by \u223c 3\u03c10 . There are no relativistic corrections to the Hartree\n\n\f22\nenergy of kaons condensed in the state with zero momentum [106] provided the\nK \u2212 n interaction is dominated by the Weinberg-Tomozawa vector potential.\nThe typical resent results for kaon energy in neutron star matter are shown in\nFig.10. The top solid line is obtained with a Wigner-Seitz [106] calculation for\npure neutron matter; it is exact in both the low and high density limits, and gives\nessentially the Hartree energy at \u03c1 > 3\u03c10 . The next curve shows the estimated\nHartree results for NM containing \u223c 15 % protons, below that is the \u03c9Lenz for\nneutron matter, while the lowest curves uses K \u2212 N scattering amplitude calculated in matter including relativistic, correlation and proton fraction corrections\n[105]. The recent [73] estimate for the central density of a 2.0 M\u2299 star is \u223c 5\u03c10 ,\nand the results shown in Fig.10 indicate that kaon condensation is unlikely at\ndensities lower than that. The heaviest stars (M = 2.2M\u2299 ) made up of NM are\npredicted to have central densities of \u223c 7\u03c10 , and the possibility of kaon condensation in their cores can not be ruled out. However, presence of \u03c0 \u2212 , or \u03a3\u2212 or\nquark drops will decrease \u03bce as discussed in the following subsections and may\nmake kaon condensation unlikely in even the most massive stars.\n\n4.2 Charged Pion Condensation\nNegatively charged \u03c0 \u2212 -mesons will condense in matter when their chemical potential becomes lower than \u03bce , as suggested by Migdal [94] and by Sawyer and\nScallapino [95]. In the seventies and eighties this possibility was studied by many\nresearchers. Their work has been reviewed in Ref. [96], and we discuss it rather\nbriefly.\nFig. 10 suggests that, in absence of interactions \u03c0 \u2212 with zero momentum will\ncondense in matter at a rather low density of \u223c 1.5\u03c10 when \u03bce exceeds their rest\nmass of 139 MeV. However, the \u03c0 \u2212 n S-wave interaction is repulsive, and raises\nthe energy of zero momentum pions sufficiently above the estimated \u03bce . The\nrecently found [108], deeply bound \u03c0 \u2212 -nucleus atomic states, are influenced by\nthis repulsion. The K \u2212 n S-wave interaction, on the other hand is attractive,\nleading to the possibility of kaon condensation discussed in the last section.\nThe energy of \u03c0 \u2212 , having momenta of the order of 2 fm\u22121 , \u223c 400 MeV without interactions, is reduced in matter by the \u03c0 \u2212 n P-wave interaction due to the\ncoupling of the \u03c0 \u2212 to p-n and N -\u2206 particle-hole states. Their energies and couplings to \u03c0 \u2212 are calculated with effective forces described with Landau parameters\nwhose density dependence is not well established. With plausible values for the\nLandau parameters a second order transition with \u03c0 \u2212 condensation is predicted\nat \u223c 2\u03c10 ; however it is not expected to have a large effect on the EOS [96].\nThe Japan group also predicts a first order transition to an interesting phase\nwith both \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 0 condensation at a density of \u223c 4.5\u03c10 . It has a significant\neffect on the EOS. Matter in this phase has spin aligned layers as discussed\nearlier in sec. 3.6 and illustrated in Fig. 11. The condensed \u03c0 0 -mesons have\nmomenta in the Z-direction, perpendicular to the layers, while that of \u03c0 \u2212 is in\nthe X-direction in the plane of the layers. This way, when a proton absorbs a \u03c0 \u2212\nform the condensate and becomes a neutron its spin direction also gets flipped\nmaintaining the attractive interaction with the \u03c0 0 field. It is a challenge to\ncalculate the energy of matter in this interesting phase from bare nuclear forces.\nThe Illinois group, working with bare nuclear forces, predicts the first order\n\u03c0 0 -condensation at a much lower density of \u223c 1.5\u03c10 (sec. 3.6). However, the total\ndecrease in energy of matter at \u223c 5\u03c10 due to pion condensation, estimated by\n\n\f23\nthe two groups: \u223c 80 by the Japan and \u223c 60 MeV/nucleon by Illinois, are not\ntoo different. The recent EOS of the Illinois group [73] contains this energy gain.\n\n4.3 Hyperonic Matter\nThe possibility of hyperons contributing to the ground state of dense matter\nhas been considered since 1959 [6, 89]. The negatively charged \u03a3\u2212 and \u2206\u2212 will\noccur when their chemical potential becomes less than \u03bcn + \u03bce in matter. With\nA18+\u03b4v+UIX\u2217 (A18+\u03b4v) interactions, the \u03bcn + \u03bce exceeds the rest mass (1197\nMeV) of \u03a3\u2212 hyperon at density of \u223c 2.2 (2.6) \u03c10 . If the \u03a3\u2212 -nucleon interactions\nare negligible, they will occur in matter via the weak interaction e\u2212 +n \u2192 \u03a3\u2212 +\u03bde\nat these densities mainly on account of the large \u03bce \u223c 170 MeV. Similarly the\nneutral hyperons such as the \u039b will occur when their chemical potentials become\nless than \u03bcn . For the above interaction models the \u03bcn exceeds the \u039b rest mass\n(1116 MeV) at densities of 2.9 and 3.7 \u03c10 , while the predicted central densities\nof 1.4 M\u2299 stars are 3.4 and 5.1 \u03c10 .\nMuch less data exist on hyperon-nucleon (YN) interactions than on the NN,\nand therefore their models are less constrained. LOBHF calculations [109] using\nthe older Nijmegen soft core YN [110] and either Paris or Argonne v14 NN interactions show that the thresholds for \u03a3\u2212 and \u039b to appear are not much moved\nby YN interactions. For example, with the Paris NN interaction the threshold\ndensities with (without) YN interactions are 3.0 (2.7) and 3.6 (3.7) \u03c10 for \u03a3\u2212\nand \u039b respectively. The Nijmegen group [111, 112] has recently constructed boson exchange interaction models based on YN and NN data base using SU(3)\nsymmetry. LOBHF calculations [113] using these models for NN as well as YN\ninteractions give 2.2 \u03c10 for the threshold density of \u03a3\u2212 , however for \u039b it is pushed\nbeyond 7 \u03c10 .\nThe above LOBHF calculations use only two-body interactions without boost\ncorrections and TNI, and fail to explain the saturation density of SNM as mentioned in sec. 3.4. Both the BHF groups [109, 113] find that the threshold densities\nare lowered after including TNI effects. For example, the Catania group predicts\nthem to be \u223c 2.1 and 2.4 \u03c10 with models including TNI and also with DiracBrueckner calculations. However, \u03a3\u2212 N N and \u039bN N three body forces should\nalso be included along with the TNI for consistency. The binding energies of\n\u039b-hypernuclei [114] suggest that the \u039bN N interaction is as strong as the TNI,\nwhile there is no data on the \u03a3\u2212 N N .\nIgnoring three-body forces and boost interactions in both nucleon and hyperon\nmatter, the LOBHF calculations with the unified NN, YN and YY interaction\nmodel [113] indicate that admixtures of \u03a3\u2212 lower the NM energy by only \u223c 25\nMeV per nucleon at 5 \u03c10 . At this density the A18+\u03b4v+UIX\u2217 model gives an\nenergy of \u223c 200 for \u03b2-stable NM. If the energy gain due to \u03a3\u2212 , is not much\nchanged by three-body interactions, we should expect \u223c 10 % effects on the EOS\nof neutron star matter at \u03c1 > 2\u03c10 due to hyperons; however, if present they would\nlower the \u03bce and increase the proton fraction xp significantly.\n\n4.4 Quark Matter\nWhen matter is compressed to densities so high that the quark cores of nucleons\noverlap substantially, one expects the nucleons to merge and undergo a phase\ntransition to quark matter (QM). The EOS of both HM and QM are necessary\n\n\f24\nto calculate effects of this transition in neutron stars. The interface properties\nare also needed to study the important mixed phase regions.\nAt present, lattice QCD can only treat the case of zero baryon chemical potential and is therefore not useful for neutron stars. Lacking a full theory, the\nsimple Bag model is used to estimate the QM EOS. In this model the QM energy\nhas a volume term denoted by the bag constant B; it represents the difference\nin the energies of the vacua occupied by hadron and QM, and is responsible for\nthe confinement of quarks within nucleons in nuclei. The term dominating at\nhigh densities is the energy of noninteracting u, d and s-quarks; it is calculated\nneglecting the mass of u, and d-quarks, and using a typical value of \u223c 150 MeV\nfor that of the s-quark. Since the quark Fermi energies are much larger than\ntheir masses, the QM properties are not too sensitive to the chosen mass for the\ns-quark. There is no one-gluon exchange interaction energy between quarks of\ndifferent flavor, while that between quarks of of the same flavor i is given by\n(2\u03b1/3\u03c0)Ei per quark of flavor i [115]. Here Ei is the average kinetic energy per\nquark, and \u03b1 is the strong interaction coupling constant, assumed to have a value\nof \u223c 0.5. All higher order gluon-exchange interactions are neglected; their contribution is presumably subsumed in the bag constant whose value is poorly known.\nTwo representative values are B = 122 [116] and 200 MeV fm\u22123 [117].\nThe equilibrium conditions for uniform QM containing u, d, s-quarks, electrons\nand muons are:\n\u03bcu + \u03bce = \u03bcd = \u03bcs ,\n\u03bc\u03bc = \u03bce .\n(20)\nThe energy densities of charge neutral QM and NM are compared in Fig.12. In\nthe interesting region of \u03c1 \u223c 1 fm\u22123 the total energy density of quark matter is\nabout 1200 MeV fm\u22123 , of which only 122 or 200 MeV fm\u22123 comes from the bag.\nAssuming the A18+\u03b4v+UIX\u2217 EOS for NM the first order phase transition to QM\nis indicated at \u223c 1 baryon/fm3 .\nIt has been recently suggested that at high densities QM may have color superconductivity resulting from non-perturbative attraction between quarks. In\nQM with only u and d-quarks this invariably leads to the possibility of a diquark\ncondensate which breaks global color invariance [118]. The associated color gap\nis estimated to be of the order of 100 MeV. When the s-quarks are included there\nare many possible phases [119].\n\n5\n\nMixtures of Phases in Dense Matter\n\nThe phases of matter considered in the past sections are uniform and locally\ncharge neutral, whereas bulk matter needs only to be charge neutral on average.\nFor example, iron metal has positively charged regions occupied by iron nuclei,\nand the space in between is negatively charged by electrons. Generally the ground\nstate of matter can have a mixture of regions occupied by different phases with\nthe constrain of overall charge neutrality.\nMatter in the outer crust of neutron stars, at \u03c1 \u2264 0.002\u03c10 , is believed to be\nlike terrestrial matter made up of neutron rich nuclei in electron gas. The inner\ncrust, on the other hand, is believed to have a mixture of regions with positively\ncharged NM composed of neutrons and protons and PNM with only neutrons\n[10], both immersed in a nearly uniform electron gas. These mixtures occur in\nthe density range of \u223c 0.002 to 0.6 \u03c10 , beyond which uniform NM is believed to\nbe the ground state. More recently mixed phases of NM and QM [120, 121], and\n\n\f25\ncondensates of pions, kaons [122], or hyperons in NM have also been considered.\nThe Coulomb energy of a single phase uniform matter, due to fluctuations in the\nelectron and hadron or quark densities, is negligible; however that of matter with\nmixed phases is not. For example, matter at \u03c1 = 0.3\u03c10 has drops of NM in PNM.\nTheir size is determined by a competition between Coulomb and surface energies;\nlarge drops have too much Coulomb energy and small drops to much surface\nenergy per nucleon. It is necessary to know the energy of the interface to predict\nthe nature of the mixed phase region quantitatively. Those for the interface\nbetween NM and PNM have been calculated from energy-density functionals of\nNM [10]; while those for interfaces of NM and QM are not well estimated. In this\nsection we discuss QM and NM mixed phases, to avoid duplicating the review\nby Pethick and Ravenhall [10], and because they can influence the mass limit of\nneutron stars.\n\n5.1 Equilibrium Conditions for Coexistence of QM and NM\nNeglecting surface and Coulomb effects, the equilibrium conditions for the coexistence of of QM and NM at zero temperature are that they have equal pressures,\nand it costs no energy to convert a neutron or a proton in NM into quarks in\nQM. The last condition amounts to\n\u03bcn = 2\u03bcd + \u03bcu\n\nand\n\n\u03bcp = \u03bcd + 2\u03bcu .\n\n(21)\n\nThe electron density, and hence the \u03bce , is assumed to be the same in QM and\nNM, therefore the \u03b2-equilibrium conditions are:\n\u03bcn = \u03bcp + \u03bce\n\nand \u03bcd = \u03bcs = \u03bcu + \u03bce .\n\n(22)\n\nAnd finally, the charge neutrality condition is given by:\nch\nf \u03c1ch\nQM + (1 \u2212 f )\u03c1N M = e(\u03c1e + \u03c1\u03bc ) .\n\n(23)\n\nHere \u03c1ch\nQM,N M are the charge densities of QM and NM, \u03c1e,\u03bc are the electron\nand muon densities, and f is the fraction of space filled by QM. A graphical\nrepresentation of these equilibrium conditions is given in ref. [73].\nAs was first pointed out by Glendenning [120], the QM and NM mixed phases\ncan span a wide density region. For example, with the A18+\u03b4v+UIX\u2217 NM EOS,\nthe mixed phases begin at 4.6 (3.4) and end at 11.3 (9.1) \u03c10 for B = 200 (122)\nMeV fm\u22123 (Fig.12). At lower densities we have uniform NM and QM at higher.\nThe QM fractional volume increases almost linearly from 0 to 1 in this transition\nrange over which \u03bce \u2192 0. The uniform QM has almost equal number of u, d,\nand s-quarks, and is essentially charge neutral without electrons. An important\nconsequence of \u03b2-equilibrium is that the QM is negatively charged at the beginning\nof the transition, where \u03bce is large. By immersing negatively charged drops of QM\nin the positively charged NM we can remove some of the high energy electrons\nand increase the proton fraction in NM. Both of these lower the energy density\nof matter.\n\n5.2 Structure of Mixed Phase Matter\nMatter with mixed phases has additional structure due to interfaces dividing the\nregions occupied by the two phases. The surface and Coulomb energies associated\n\n\f26\nwith these interfaces, neglected in above section, raise the energy of the mixed\nphase matter as well as determine the topology and structural length scales. The\nsurface energy can presumably be estimated from the surface tension, \u03c3. For NM\n\u03c3 \u2243 1MeV/fm2 whereas for QM it poorly known; typical values are in the range\n10-100 MeV/fm2 [121]).\nDenoting the dimensionality of the structures by D (D = 3 for droplets and\nbubbles, D = 2 for rods and D = 1 for plates) the surface energies are generally\n[10]\n4\u03c0\n(24)\nES = D\u03c3 R2 ,\n3\nand, for D = 3 the Coulomb energy, EC = (3/5)Z 2 e2 /R, where R the size of the\nstructure and\n4\u03c0 3\nch\nZe = (\u03c1ch\nR ,\n(25)\nQM \u2212 \u03c1N M )\n3\nis the excess charge of the droplet compared with the surrounding medium. General equations for EC (R, D) are given in ref. [10]. Minimizing the energy density\nwith respect to R we obtain the usual result that ES = 2EC at equilibrium. Minimizing with respect to the continuous dimensionality as well thus determines\nboth R and D. For droplets (D = 3) the equilibrium radius is found to be:\nR \u2243 4.0 fm\n\n\u03c3\n1MeV/fm2\n\n!1/3\n\nch\n\u03c1ch\nQM \u2212 \u03c1N M\ne\u03c10 /2\n\n!\u22122/3\n\n.\n\n(26)\n\nA droplet of symmetric NM in vacuum has a surface tension \u03c3 = 1 MeV*fm\u22122 for\nwhich (26) gives R \u2243 4 fm, which agrees with the fact that nuclei like 56 Fe are\nthe most stable form of matter at low density. For QM droplets both the surface\ntension and charge densities are larger but the estimates of R are similar.\nAt the beginning of the mixed phase region we expect that spherical droplets\nof QM, with R \u223c 5 fm, will form a BCC lattice in uniform NM. They would have\nbaryon number of the order of few hundred, and a negative charge of similar\nmagnitude. As density increases and f approaches 0.5, the drops would merge\nand form rods, which merge further on to form sheats. When f > 0.5 the NM\nsheats break up into rods, and then into drops and eventually disappear when\nf = 1. This scenario is similar to that in the inner crust; at low densities there\nare drops of NM occupying a small fraction of space. By \u03c1 \u223c 0.6\u03c10 NM occupies\nall space via a similar set of mixed phases.\nAn other effect of the Coulomb and surface energies is that they decrease the\ndensity range covered by the mixed phase region. In particular, the lower density\nedge of this interesting region may be pushed up by almost \u03c10 if \u03c3 is in the 10 to\n50 MeV fm\u22122 range [121]. The energy density of the mixed phase matter is also\n> 70 MeV\nraised by a few MeV fm\u22123 in this case. Finally, if \u03c3 were to be large (\u223c\n\u22122\nfm ) the mixed phases may not be energetically favorable, and there will be a\nsimple first order phase transition from NM to QM with a density discontinuity.\nOne should bear in mind that even if the droplet phase were favored energetically,\nit may not be realized in practice if the time required to nucleate QM drops is\ntoo long compared to pulsar ages.\n\n\f27\nTable 2: Properties of maximum mass (Mm ) and 1.4 M\u2299 neutron stars in M\u2299 ,\n\u03c10 and km.\nInteractions\nA18\nA18+\u03b4v\nA18+\u03b4v+UIX\u2217\nA18+UIX\nParis+TNI\nBonn A\n\n6\n\nCalc.\nVar.\nVar.\nVar.\nVar.\nBHF\nDBHF\n\nRef.\n[73]\n[73]\n[73]\n[73]\n[85]\n[85]\n\nMm\n1.67\n1.80\n2.20\n2.38\n1.94\n2.10\n\n\u03c1c (Mm )\n11.1\n9.4\n7.2\n6.0\n8.3\n6.7\n\nR(Mm )\n8.1\n8.7\n10.1\n10.8\n9.5\n10.6\n\n\u03c1c (1.4)\n7.0\n5.1\n3.4\n2.9\n4.0\n3.1\n\nR(1.4)\n8.2\n10.1\n11.5\n12.1\n11.1\n11.7\n\nNeutron Star Observations and Predictions\n\nThe gross structure of neutron stars has been predicted using very many EOS,\nphenomenological as well as based on realistic models of nuclear forces [43, 51]. Of\nthese we consider only those based on realistic models primarily because one can\nalways find phenomenological energy density functionals or Lagrangians which\nreproduce their EOS.\nTypical results for nonrotating stars with maximum mass, and with M =\n1.4M\u2299 , obtained by recent calculations, are listed in Table 2. The results for A18\nwithout boost correction \u03b4v are listed primarily for reference. This correction\nis unambiguous [74], and must be added to obtain reliable results. Those for\nA18+\u03b4v are also to be taken less seriously, because it gives too large value for\n\u03c10 . The TNI used with the Paris NN interaction [85] is of the Urbana form\nwith parameters determined by reproducing the empirical SNM properties (see\nsec. 3.4). In A18+UIX and Paris+TNI models the \u03b4v is not considered explicitly;\nit is approximately subsumed in the TNI fitted to data. Of the three Bonn\nmodels, Bonn A comes closest to reproduce the empirical properties of SNM [88]\nwith Dirac-Brueckner (DBHF) method. These calculations include the \u03b4v as well\nas many-body forces generated via Z-diagrams.\nThe A18+\u03b4v+UIX\u2217 , A18+UIX, Paris+TNI and Bonn-A (DBHF) models come\nclose to reproducing the empirical \u03c10 ; the later two fit the SNM binding energy;\nwhile the former models fit binding energies of light nuclei via exact calculations,\nsince the energy of SNM can not yet be calculated reliably. Nevertheless these four\n\"realistic\" models of NM give rather similar results which are not too different\nfrom those of the 1988 calculations of Wiringa, Fiks and Fabrocini [91] with the\nolder Urbana-Argonne interactions now replaced with A18 and UIX.\nThe effect of the possible appearance of QM drops in high density matter has\nbeen studied with the A18+\u03b4v+UIX\u2217 model. The Mm is reduced to 2.02 and\n1.91 M\u2299 for bag-constant values B = 200 and 122 MeV Fm\u22123 respectively, while\nthe predictions for 1.4 M\u2299 stars remain unchanged. Presence of either kaons or\nhyperons in dense matter is unlikely to have much of an effect on the 1.4 M\u2299\nstars due to their low central density, while that on the mass limit is difficult\nto estimate quantitatively. For example, if kaons were to condense in matter at\n\u03c1 = 5\u03c10 and limit \u03c1c to < 5 \u03c10 , the Mm of the four realistic models will drop to \u223c\n2.0, 2.3, 1.7 and 2.0 M\u2299 respectively; while if hyperons were to lower the energy\nof matter at \u03c1 = 5\u03c10 by 25 MeV per baryon, the Mm would be reduced by \u223c 0.2\nM\u2299 .\nThe mass radius relation obtained with models based on the A18 interaction\n\n\f28\nare shown in Fig.13. Results of A18 and A18+\u03b4v models are given primerily\nfor comparison. As expected the harder EOS give larger Mm and predict larger\nradii. The differences between the radii predicted by the realistic models is only\n\u223c 10 %.\n\n6.1 The Mass Limit\nThe observed mass of Hulse-Taylor pulsar B1913+16 of 1.4411 \u00b1 0.00035 [12]\nshows that Mm > 1.44M\u2299 . All the radio pulsars in known neutron star, and\nneutron star-white dwarf binaries have masses with lower limits less than 1.44M\u2299 .\nThe X-ray pulsar Vela X-1, which orbits a supergiant, however is consistently\nestimated to have a larger mass of \u223c 1.9. The motion of this star is perturbed\nfrom being pure Keplerian, presumably by tidal forces exerted by the neutron\nstar, and its present mass estimate, 1.87+0.23\n\u22120.17 [15], indicates that Mm > 1.7M\u2299 at\n95 % confidance level. Finally, if the QPO's indeed originate from the innermost\nstable orbit [18, 19], then Mm > 2M\u2299 . These mass limits are compatible with\npredictions of realistic NM models.\nOn the other hand there is no evidence that SN 1987A produced a neutron\nstar. Its observed luminosity is now well below the 1038 ergs/s Eddington limit,\nsuggesting that no neutron star was produced in this supernovae [123]. If we\nassume that the total mass, MT ot , of the collapsed core plus the matter that fell\nback on to the core after the explosion, went into a black hole, then neutron\nstar Mm must be less than \u223c 0.9MT ot . The factor 0.9 takes into account the\n\u223c 10 % gravitational binding energy of the neutron star. Bethe and Brown [23]\nestimate MT ot \u223c 1.73M\u2299 using supernovae calculations by Wilson and Mayle,\nand conclude that Mm < 1.56M\u2299 . Uncertainties in these arguments have been\ndiscussed by Zampieri et. al. [124]. If the conclusion is found to be valid, then\nthere must be other explanations for the Vela X-1 observations and the QPO,\nand the NM prediction for the Mm is too large.\n\n6.2 Temperatures, Cooling and Radii\nNeutron stars are born with interior temperatures of the order 1012 K, but cool\nrapidly via neutrino emission to temperatures of the order 1010 K within minutes\n< 106 K in 105 yr. Spectra observed in X-ray or UV bands for nearby pulsars\nand \u223c\nhave in some cases black-body components from which surface temperatures of\norder T \u223c 106 K are extracted for pulsars of age 103 \u2212 106 years. It is, however,\nunclear how much of the observed radiation is due to pulsar phenomena, to a\nsynchrotron-emitting nebula or to the neutron star itself. In other cases upper\nlimits have been set from the absence of X-rays. The surface temperatures are\ncompatible with predictions from standard modified URCA cooling processes\n[125]\nn + n \u2192 n + p + e\u2212 + \u03bd\u0304e , n + p + e\u2212 \u2192 n + n + \u03bde .\n(27)\nFaster cooling processes as direct URCA or due to quark matter, kaon or hyperon\ncondensates generally lead to considerably lower temperatures [126]. To be consistent with observed surface temperatures the exotic coolant can only exist in a\nminor portion of the neutron star or it is superfluid whereby cooling is suppressed\nby factors of \u221d exp(\u2212\u2206/T ), where \u2206 is the pairing gap.\nThe Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has observed one thermally radiating neutron star RX J185635-3754 with surface temperature T \u2243 6 \u00d7 105 K\u2243 50 eV [20].\n\n\f29\nIts distance is less than 120 pc from Earth and should soon be determined more\naccurately by HST parallax measurements. Circumstancial evidence indicate a\ndistance of \u223c80 pc [51] which leads to a black-body radius of \u223c 12 \u2212 13 km from\nits luminosity and temperature. Such radii would agree well with predictions of\nrealistic NM EOS (Fig.13) for M \u2243 1 \u2212 2M\u2299 .\n\n6.3 Glitches and Superfluidity\nSudden spin jumps, called glitches, superimposed upon otherwise gradual spin\ndown have been observed in most of the younger isolated pulsars [127]. Since\ntheir discovery the Crab and Vela pulsars have each produced about a dozen\nglitches with period changes \u2206P/P of the order of 10\u22128 and 10\u22126 respectively.\nIn post-glitch relaxation most of the period increase \u2206P decays.\nMany mechanisms have been proposed to explain the glitches [128]. The most\nplausible of these attributes glitches to the angular momentum stored in the\nrotating superfluid neutrons in the inner crust [129, 10]. The magnetic torque\nslows down the crust and most of the star except for these superfluid neutrons.\nTheir angular momentum is stored in vortices pinned to nuclei in the inner core,\nuntil an instability occurs that leads to vortex depinning and sudden angular\nmomentum transfer to the crust, leading to the glitch. At subnuclear densities\nin the crust, 1 S0 pairing between neutrons leads to gaps of order \u223c1 MeV [128].\nIn NM at \u03c1 > \u03c10 this pairing gap vanishes, but 3 P2 pairing of neutrons and 1 S0\npairing of protons may occur [128, 84].\nThe size of the glitches sets a lower limit on the moment of inertia of the\nsuperfluid in the inner crust which in turn sets a lower limit on the neutron star\nradius for a given mass [127]. Assuming that the mass of Vela pulsar is 1.4M\u2299 ,\na conservative limit on its radius is R \u2265 9 km; it is compatible with predictions\nof most EOS.\n\n7\n\nConclusions\n\nSince the discovery of pulsars a significant effort has been devoted to accurately\ncalculate properties of dense NM from realistic models of nuclear forces. Exact\ncalculations of NM are still out or reach, however the new AFDMC methods\n(sect. 3.7) may eventually succeed. The present variational upper bounds seem\nto be above the true energies by \u223c 12 %. Such an error does not have serious\nconsequences on the predicted properties of neutron stars. For example, an EOS\nobtained by reducing the variational energies, without rest mass terms, by 12 %\nreduces the maximum mass of A18+\u03b4v+UIX\u2217 model by 2.3 % to 2.14 M\u2299 , and\nthe radius of 1.4 M\u2299 star by 2.9 % to 11.2 km. Larger uncertainties stem from\nthe fact that the double \u03c0 0 and \u03c0 \u2212 condensation scenario illustrated in Fig.11\nhas not yet been calculated with realistic interactions, though it appears unlikely\nthat it will influence the NM EOS by much more than 10 %.\nLocal models of two-nucleon interaction seem to be now converging. The predictions based on the 1988 calculations with Argonne 14 interaction are not too\ndifferent from those of the 1998 calculations with the more accurate A18. It also\nseems likely that the local models give a fairly accurate description of two-nucleon\ninteraction. A concern is that the present models of TNI are based on fits to a\nrather limited set of data, and are not as precise as the NN-interaction models.\nHowever, addition of the UIX\u2217 TNI to the A18+\u03b4v increases the maximum mass\n\n\f30\nby \u223c 20 % and R(1.4) by 13 % (Table 2). These changes may be important but\nthey are not very large.\nThe present models of kaon-nucleon and hyperon-nucleon interactions are based\non very limited data, and we have none on K \u2212 N N and \u03a3\u2212 N N three-body forces.\nThese could have significant effect on the threshold densities for kaons and hyperons to appear in dense matter. Hopefully advances in QCD and quark-models\nwill provide a more rigorous framework to describe these interactions, and calculate properties of quark matter. The bag model estimates of QM EOS may have\nsignificant corrections at densities of interest in neutron stars.\n\u00bfFrom present observations there seem to be three possible scenarios for the\nlimiting mass of neutron stars. If QPO's are indeed due to accretion from the\ninnermost stable orbit, then the NM predictions of Mm \u223c 2.2M\u2299 are reasonable,\nand strange baryons and quark drops do not soften the EOS of matter at \u03c1 < 7\u03c10\nsignificantly. If the Vela X-1 mass measurement is correct, but QPO's have some\nother origin, then Mm could be \u223c 1.8 M\u2299 , indicating some softening of the\nNM EOS. However, if the present interpretation of QPO's and Vela X-1 mass\nmeasurements are both faulty, and Mm is as small as 1.56 Mm as estimated from\nthe absence of a neutron star in SN 1987A, then a significant softening of the NM\nEOS by phase transitions is indicated. Further observations will hopefully clear\nthis situation.\nPhase transitions such as NM to QM, can soften the EOS significantly. Fortunately these can have a measurable effect on the spin down of a rapidly rotating\nstar in favorable cases, as has been recently pointed out [130, 131]. Consider the\ncase of a rapidly rotating star whose central density is close to a first order phase\ntransition. As the star slows and the central pressure increases due to decrease\nof the centrifugal force, the core matter will change its phase and become more\ndense at a critical angular velocity \u03a9c . This decreases the moment of inertia,\nwhich assumes the characteristic form:\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nI = I0 1 + c1 \u03a92 \u2212 c2 (\u03a92c \u2212 \u03a92 )3/2 + ... .\n\n(28)\n\nfor \u03a9 < \u03a9c . Here, c1 and c2 are small parameters proportional to the density\ndifference between the two phases, and c2 = 0 for \u03a9 > \u03a9c .\nIn order to make contact with observation, the temporal behavior of angular\nvelocities must be considered. The pulsars slow down at a rate given by the loss\nof rotational energy, believed to be given by: d( 12 I\u03a92 )/dt \u221d \u2212\u03a9n+1 , where n = 3\nfor dipole radiation, Eq. (1) and n = 5 for gravitational radiation. With the\nmoment of inertia given by Eq. (28) the angular velocity can be calculated. The\ncorresponding braking index, n(\u03a9) = \u03a9\u0308\u03a9/\u03a9\u03072 , depends on the second derivative\nof the moment of inertia, I \u2032\u2032 = dI/d2 \u03a9. Using Eq. (28) we obtain:\n\u03a94\n.\nn(\u03a9) \u2243 n \u2212 c1 \u03a92 + c2 p 2\n\u03a9c \u2212 \u03a92\n\n(29)\n\nwhich exhibits a characteristic (\u03a9c \u2212 \u03a9)\u22121/2 singularity as \u03a9 approaches \u03a9c from\nbelow. Observations of the braking index of a rapidly rotating, new born pulsar\nwould be very interesting.\nAll realistic NM EOS predict that the radius of neutron stars with a mass of\n1 to 1.5 M\u2299 is \u223c 11 to 12 km. Future high resolution Chandra and XMM space\nobservatories will hopefully be able to measure black-body spectra and detect\ngravitationally redshifted spectral lines from several stars. Such observations will\n\n\f31\nhelp determine masses, radii and temperatures uniquely if the distance of the\nstar is known. It is important to know the radius of a 1.4 M\u2299 star, because that\n< 3\u03c1 region in which large modifications of NM EOS\nwould test the EOS in the \u03c1\u223c\n0\nare not expected on the basis of our present, naive estimates of kaon-nucleon and\n\u03a3\u2212 -nucleon interactions.\n\n8\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to thank J.
