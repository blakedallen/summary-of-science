We show that, this theory can\nbe conformally symmetrized using an appropriate conformal transformation. The\nresulting theory allows a particle interpretation, and suggests that the quantum\naspects of matter may be geometrized.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nConformal invariance is one of the desirable symmetries in modern theories of physics. The\nprinciple of conformal invariance states that all of the fundamental equations of physics should\nbe fully invariant under local transformations of the units of length and time 1 . In principle, such\ntransformations correspond to stretching all lengths and durations by the space-time dependent\nconversion factors \u03a9. Conformal transformation techniques have been widely used in scalartensor theories as alternative theories of gravity.\nIn this paper, we shall show that these techniques can be used to conformally symmetrize a\nnon-conformally invariant theory. The resulting conformally invariant theory may be interpreted\nfrom different viewpoints with respect to the first one. As a model, we shall take the nonconformally invariant Brans-Dicke theory and show that this theory transforms to a conformally\ninvariant one for which a particle interpretation can be derived. We shall use units in which\nh\u0304=c=1.\n\u2217\n\ne-mail address: m7412926@cic.aku.ac.ir\ne-mail address: h-salehi@cc.sbu.ac.ir\n\u2021\ne-mail address: golshani@ihcs.ac.ir\n\u2020\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDuality Transformation\n\nWe start with the vacuum part of the Brans-Dicke theory described by the action\n1\nS[\u03a6] =\n2k\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nln \u03b2 \u03bc\u03bd\ng \u2207\u03bc \u03a6\u2207\u03bd \u03a6}\nd4 x \u2212g{\u03a6R \u2212\n\u03a6\n\n(1)\n\nwhere k = 8\u03c0G, R is the curvature scalar, \u03a6 denotes a real scalar field nonminimally coupled\nto the gravity, and ln \u03b2 represents Brans-Dicke parameter. One can easily check that the action\n(1) is not invariant under the conformal transformation\ng\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\u2192 \u03a92 (x)g\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u03a6 \u2212\u2192 \u03a9\u22122 (x)\u03a6\n\n,\n\nunless ln \u03b2 = \u22123/2. This action is invariant under what we call the duality transformation\n(\u03a6) \u2212\u2192 (\u03a6)D\n\n(2)\n\nwhere we have used the abbreviations\n(\u03a6) = (g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a6, \u03b2)\n\nand\n\n(\u03a6)D = (\u03a92 g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a9\u22122 \u03a6, \u03b2 \u22121 )\n\nq\n\nln \u03b2\nwith \u03a9 = (G\u03a6)\u03b1 in which \u03b1 = 12 [1 \u00b1 3\u22122\n3+2 ln \u03b2 ]. The duality transformation (2) is a special\ncase of general transformations introduced in Ref. 2. This transformation tells us that, in\nthe vacuum sector there is no distinction between large and small values of \u03b2, or equivalently\nbetween positive and negative values of Brans-Dicke parameter ln \u03b2. Thus, one can not estimate\nthis parameter definitely, unless matter field is present. In principle, there is no distinction\nbetween (\u03a6) and its dual (\u03a6)D , and one may take these as equivalent configurations in the\nvacuum. However, a distinction between (\u03a6) and (\u03a6)D can be made if the sign of the BransDicke parameter ln \u03b2 is important. Typically, if the action (1) is coupled to the matter field,\nthe observational constraint implies ln \u03b2 > 500. While in the model which we present in a later\nsection, particle interpretation requires ln \u03b2 < \u2212 23 .\n\n3\n\nThe Conformally Transformed Action\n\nTo conformally symmetrize the action (1), first we put (1), with redefinitions \u03a6 = G\u03c62 and\nln \u03b2 = \u2212 23 (1 + \u03be), into the form\n3\nS[\u03c6] =\n8\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n1\n1\nd4 x \u2212g{ \u03c62 R + (1 + \u03be)g \u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc \u03c6\u2207\u03bd \u03c6 + \u03bb\u03c64 }\n6\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere 21 \u03bb\u03c64 is a cosmological function which is added for later usage, \u03bb being a dimensionless\nparameter. This action is not invariant under the conformal transformation\ng\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\u2192 \u03a92 (x)g\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u03c6 \u2212\u2192 \u03a9\u22121 (x)\u03c6\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nunless \u03be = 0. Thus, one may consider \u03be as the deformation parameter which characterizes the\nconformal invariance breaking.\nApplying the conformal transformation (4) to the action (3) one sees that all terms are\n\u221a\ninvariant, except the term \u2212g\u03beg \u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc \u03c6\u2207\u03bd \u03c6 which transforms as\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2212g\u03beg\u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc \u03c6\u2207\u03bd \u03c6 \u2212\u2192 \u2212g\u03c62 g\u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc S\u2207\u03bd S\n\n2\n\n\fwhere we have used the definition\nS=\n\np\n\n\u03be ln(\u03c6l/\u03a9)\n\n(5)\n\nin which l is a fundamental length. The introduction of this length is necessary to make the\nargument of the logarithm dimensionless. The point now is that S as a dimensionless field does\nnot transform under a subsequent conformal transformation.\nTherefore, applying the conformal transformation (4) and using the definition (5), the action\n(3) transforms to\n3\nS[\u03c6] =\n8\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n1\n1\nd4 x \u2212g{g \u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc \u03c6\u2207\u03bd \u03c6 + (g \u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc S\u2207\u03bd S + R)\u03c62 + \u03bb\u03c64 }\n6\n2\n\n(6)\n\nwhich is exactly conformally invariant.\nVariations of S[\u03c6] with respect to \u03c6 and S lead, respectively, to\n1\n\u2737g \u03c6 \u2212 (g\u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc S\u2207\u03bd S + R)\u03c6 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c63 = 0\n6\n\n(7)\n\n\u2207\u03bc (\u03c62 \u2207\u03bc S) = 0\n\n(8)\n\nand\n\nwhere \u2737g = g \u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd .\nVariation of S[\u03c6] with respect to g\u03bc\u03bd gives the gravitational equation, but we shall use here\na non-variational technique to derive this equation. For this purpose we multiply the field Eq.\n(7) by \u2207\u03bc \u03c6\n1\n\u2737g \u03c6\u2207\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 (\u2207\u03b1 S\u2207\u03b1 S + R)\u03c6\u2207\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c63 \u2207\u03bc \u03c6 = 0.\n6\nThe first term can be rewritten as\n1\n\u2737g \u03c6\u2207\u03bc \u03c6 = \u2207\u03bd (\u2207\u03bc \u03c6\u2207\u03bd \u03c6 \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03b1 \u03c6\u2207\u03b1 \u03c6).\n2\nThe term \u03c6\u2207\u03bc \u03c6\u2207\u03b1 S\u2207\u03b1 S may be rewritten in the form\n\u03c6\u2207\u03bc \u03c6\u2207\u03b1 S\u2207\u03b1 S =\n=\n\n1\n(\u2207\u03bc \u03c62 )\u2207\u03b1 S\u2207\u03b1 S\n2\n1\n\u2207\u03bd (\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u03c62 \u2207\u03b1 S\u2207\u03b1 S \u2212 2\u03c62 \u2207\u03bc S\u2207\u03bd S)\n2\n\nwhere we have used Eq.

(9). A varying configuration of \u03c6 leads, in general, to non conserved tensor T\u03bc\u03bd\nNow, if we want to couple the action (6) to the free gravitational action, we obtain\n\nG\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212kT\u03bc\u03bd .\nSince the conformal invariant action (6) has no free gravitational part in the vacuum sector, we\nhave T\u03bc\u03bd = 0. Thus, one finds\n\u03c62 G\u03bc\u03bd + (g\u03bc\u03bd \u2737g \u2212 \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd )\u03c62 + 6(\u2207\u03bc \u03c6\u2207\u03bd \u03c6 + \u03c62 \u2207\u03bc S\u2207\u03bd S)\n3\n\u22123g\u03bc\u03bd (\u2207\u03b1 \u03c6\u2207\u03b1 \u03c6 + \u03c62 \u2207\u03b1 S\u2207\u03b1 S) \u2212 \u03bb\u03c64 g\u03bc\u03bd = 0\n2\n\n(10)\n\nwhich is the gravitational equation. This equation can be derived in the standard way from the\nvariation of the action (6) with respect to g\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n4\n\nParticle Interpretation\n\nThe action (6) and the corresponding Eqs. (7), (8) and (10) are exactly conformally invariant\nunder the conformal transformation (4). This implies that the non-conformally invariant theory\n(3) which is introduced with symmetry breaking parameter \u03be, may be symmetrized using the\nconformal transformation (4) and definition (5). This definition constraints \u03be to positive values,\nor equivalently ln \u03b2 < \u2212 23 .\nNow, we study a particular way to arrive at a particle interpretation of the theory given by\nthe action (6). Let us rewrite Eq. (7) as\ng \u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc S\u2207\u03bd S = \u2212\u03bb\u03c62 +\n\n\u2737g \u03c6 1\n\u2212 R.\n\u03c6\n6\n\n(11)\n\nConformal invariance of this equation, or equivalently conformal symmetry of the action (6)\nimplies that various frames can be assigned to the theory given by this action, depending on the\nparticular configuration which one chooses for the scalar field \u03c6.\nWe first study a frame by the condition \u03c6 = \u03c60 = const. In this frame Eqs. (8) and (11)\ntake, respectively, the forms\n\u2737g S = 0\n\n4\n\n(12)\n\n\fand\n1\ng\u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc S\u2207\u03bd S = \u2212M0 2 \u2212 R\n6\n\n(13)\n\nwhere M02 = \u03bb\u03c620 .\nIn the limit g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\u2192 \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd , in which \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd is the Minkowski metric, the last equation takes the\nform of Hamilton-Jacobi equation characterizing an ensemble of relativistic particle. At every\npoint a particle has a four-momentum \u2207\u03bc S, and mass M0 . We may call this frame the classical\nframe.\nTo define another frame, we can apply the conformal transformation\ng\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\u2192 \u03a92 (x)g\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u03c60 \u2212\u2192 \u03a9\u22121 (x)\u03c60\n\n,\n\n(14)\n\nto the classical frame. In the new frame, Eq. (13) takes the form\ng\u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc S\u2207\u03bd S = \u2212M0 2 +\n\n\u2737g \u03a9 1\n\u2212 R\n\u03a9\n6\n\n(15)\n\nwhere we have used the transformation law of the Ricci curvature R under (14)\nR \u2212\u2192 \u03a9\u22122 (R \u2212 6\n\n\u2737g \u03a9\n).\n\u03a9\n\nComparison of Eqs. (13) and (15) indicates that, the new frame is equivalent to the classical\ng\nframe, except for the particle mass which is modified by an extra term \u2737\u03a9\u03a9 . The physical\ninterpretation of the extra term is postponed to the next section.\nIn the new frame, Eq. (12) does not change, however, it is convenient to rewrite it in the\nfollowing form\n\u2207\u03bc (\u03a92 \u2207\u03bc S) = M\n\nd 2\n\u03a9\nd\u03c4\n\n(16)\n\nwhere we have used\n\u2207 \u03bc S = M U\u03bc\n\nand\n\nU\u03bc \u2207\u03bc =\n\nd\nd\u03c4\n\nin which \u03c4 is a parameter along the particle trajectory and U\u03bc is the four-velocity of the particle.\n\n5\n\nRelativistic Motion of the Particle\n\nIn the new frame, the equation of motion of a particle in the ensemble may be described in\nterms of a pilot wave\n\u03c8 = \u03a9 eiS .\nThis wave satisfies the equation\n1\nd\n\u2737g \u03c8 \u2212 M0 2 \u03c8 = ( R + 2iM\nln |\u03c8|)\u03c8\n6\nd\u03c4\nwhich is obtained from the combination of Eqs. (15) and (16).\n\n5\n\n\fUnder the assumption that the amplitude \u03a9 is independent of the parameter \u03c4 along the\nparticle trajectory, we get\n\u2737g \u03c8 \u2212 M02 \u03c8 =\n\n1\nR\u03c8\n6\n\nwhich in the background approximation g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\u2192 \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd leads to the Klein-Gordon equation with\nthe mass M0 .\nThe merit of introducing the wave \u03c8 is that it acts as a sort of a pilot wave in the sense of\ng\ncausal interpretation of quantum mechanics,4,5 the term \u2737\u03a9\u03a9 on the right hand side of Eq. (15)\nbeing the associated quantum potential. Therefore, we may call the new frame, the quantum\none. The appearance of quantum potential is a consequence of transition from the classical frame\nto the quantum one by the application of the conformal transformation. This supports the idea\nthat quantum effects may be contained in the conformal degree of freedom of the space-time\nmetric, and that the quantum aspects of matter may be geometrized.6,7\n\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\nJ.
