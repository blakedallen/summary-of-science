The measured elliptic flow is not only large but also shows a constituent\nquark number scaling, especially at intermediate transverse momenta, i.e., the dependence of the elliptic flows\nof identified hadrons on their transverse momenta becomes similar if both are divided by the number of constituent quarks in a hadron. This scaling behavior of\nhadron elliptic flows is well described by the quark coalescence model for hadron production from the quarkgluon plasma (QGP) formed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Also, the measured elliptic flows\nof identified hadrons follow a mass ordering at low transverse momenta, namely, the strength of the elliptic flow\nbecomes smaller as the hadron mass increases. This has\nalso been well described by the transport model [9] as\nwell as by the ideal hydrodynamics [10, 11].\nRecently, the elliptic flow of deuterons has been\n\u221a\nmeasured in Au+Au collisions at energy\nsN N =\n200 GeV [12, 13]. The data from the PHENIX Collaboration covers the intermediate transverse momentum\n(pT ) region [12], while the STAR Collaboration has made\nmeasurements in a wider range of pT including the low\npT region [13]. The two measurements agree well at\nintermediate pT region (pT > 1.5 GeV/c) except that\nthe STAR data show a negative elliptic flow at low pT\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: yoh@kisti.re.kr\naddress: linz@ecu.edu\n\u2021 Electronic address: ko@comp.tamu.edu\n\u2020 Electronic\n\n(pT < 1 GeV/c). A negative elliptic flow has also been\nseen in the preliminary data from the PHENIX Collaboration for J/\u03c8's at pT \u223c 1.5 GeV/c [14, 15]. Negative\nvalues of deuteron elliptic flow cannot be explained by\nthe coalescence model unless nucleons have negative elliptic flows [16], while negative J/\u03c8 flows may [17] or may\nnot [18] require negative charm quark elliptic flows. Since\nmeasured nucleon elliptic flow does not show any negative value in small transverse momentum region [12, 19],\nobserved negative values of deuteron elliptic flow raise an\ninteresting question on the mechanism for their production and interactions in relativistic heavy ion collisions.\nIn Ref. [16], two of us have studied deuteron production at RHIC in a dynamical model which is based on\nthe time-dependent perturbation theory. Using the elementary reactions of N N \u2192 d\u03c0, N N N \u2192 dN , and\nN N \u03c0 \u2192 d\u03c0, we have computed the production rate of\ndeuterons using the measured nucleon transverse momentum distribution that is parameterized by an effective\ntemperature and a momentum-dependent elliptic flow.\nAlthough the energy is conserved in this approach, in\ncontrast with the coalescence model, it needs the introduction of the reaction time and volume as parameters to\nfix the multiplicity of deuterons. The resulting deuteron\npT spectrum and elliptic flow are found to be similar to\nthose of the coalescence model based on the same nucleon\nmomentum distribution. Compared to the experimental\ndata [12, 13], the calculated deuteron pT spectrum is,\nhowever, too soft. As discussed in Ref. [16], this is due\nto the use of an effective temperature to model the effect\nof radial flow, resulting in the absence of correlations between nucleon positions and momenta. For the elliptic\nflow of deuterons, this approach describes reasonably the\nexperimental data except at small pT , where it gives positive values while the data show negative values [13].\nTo overcome the shortcomings of the model in Ref. [16],\nwe use in the present work a transport model to study\ndeuteron production and elliptic flow in relativistic heavy\nion collisions. We assume that the particles produced\n\n\f2\nfrom hadronization of the created quark-gluon plasma\nare in thermal and chemical equilibrium and undergo collective motions, similar to those described by the blast\nwave model [20], and they then interact with each other\nvia hadronic rescattering. For the latter, we use a relativistic transport model (art) [21, 22, 23] code embedded in a multiphase transport model (ampt) [24]. We\nalso carry out a coalescence model calculation using the\nfreeze-out nucleons to form deuterons. This approach is\ndifferent from the coalescence model used in Ref. [16] as\nit includes the position and momentum correlations of final nucleons through their collective motions introduced\nin the initial blast wave model and further generated by\nfinal hadronic rescattering.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In the next section,\nwe describe the blast wave model used for generating the\nhadrons produced at hadronization that are taken as the\ninitial conditions in the transport model for describing\nhadronic rescattering. Section III gives the results for the\ntransverse momentum distributions and elliptic flows of\npions and protons after hadronic scattering. The results\nfor the deuteron transverse momentum distribution and\nelliptic flow are presented and discussed in Sec. IV. These\nresults are further compared in Section V with those from\nthe dynamical coalescence model. We also compare in\nSection VI the deuteron emission time distributions from\nthese two models and discuss in Section VII the nucleon\nnumber of scaling of deuteron elliptic flow. Section VIII\ncontains a summary and discussions. The elementary\nproduction and annihilation processes for deuterons that\nare included in the transport model are described in the\nAppendix.\nII.\n\nINITIAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF HADRONS\n\nIn relativistic heavy ion collisions, where a quark-gluon\nplasma is produced, hadrons are initially formed during hadronization of the QGP. To describe the distribution of these hadrons, we use the blast-wave model which\nassumes that they are in thermal and chemical equilibrium and undergo a collective expansion. As in the art\nmodel, we include in the present work mesons such as\n\u03c0, \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03b7, K, K \u2217 , and \u03c6 and baryons such as N , \u2206,\n\u039b, and \u03a3 as well as their anti-particles. We also include\nboth deuterons and anti-deuterons in the initial distributions. The Lorentz-invariant thermal distribution f (x, p)\nof these particles at temperature TC is then given by\nf (x, p) \u221d exp{\u2212p\u03bc u\u03bc /TC },\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the four-momentum p\u03bc is\np\u03bc = (p0 , p) = (mT cosh y, pT cos \u03c6p , pT sin \u03c6p , mT sinh y)\n(2)\nand the flow four-velocity u\u03bc (x) is\nu\u03bc = cosh \u03c1(cosh \u03b7, tanh \u03c1 cos \u03c6, tanh \u03c1 sin \u03c6, sinh \u03b7)\n= \u03b3T (cosh \u03b7, \u03b2, sinh \u03b7).\n(3)\n\nIn the\np above, y is the energy-momentum rapidity, mT\n(= m2 + p2T ) is the transverse mass withpm being the\nmass of the considered particle, \u03b3T = 1/ 1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 , and\n\u03b7 (\u03c1) is the longitudinal (transverse) flow rapidity. We\nhave followed the usual convention to define the z-axis\nalong the beam direction and the x-axis in the reaction\nplane of the collision. The angles \u03c6p and \u03c6 in the above\nare the azimuthal angles of the momentum and position\nvectors of a particle with respect to the x-axis. For the\nlongitudinal flow, it is assumed to be boost invariant so\nthat the longitudinal flow rapidity is equal to the energymomentum rapidity, i.e., \u03b7 = y. We further assume that\nthe distribution in the energy-momentum rapidity is uniform in the midrapidity.\nBecause of non-vanishing elliptic flow v2 in non-central\nheavy ion collisions, which is defined as\n*\n+\np2x \u2212 p2y\nv2 =\n(4)\np2x + p2y\nwith px and py being, respectively, the projections of the\nparticle transverse momentum along the x and y axes\nin the transverse plane, the transverse flow velocity is\nanisotropic with respect to the azimuthal angle \u03c6. We\nthus parameterize the transverse flow velocity as\n\u03b2 = \u03b2(r) [1 + \u03b5(pT ) cos(2\u03c6)] n\u0302,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere n\u0302 is the unit vector in the direction of their transverse flow velocity \u03b2, which is taken to be normal to\nthe surface of the hadronic system to be defined below.\nWe have also introduced a pT -dependent coefficient \u03b5 to\nmodel the saturation of the resulting v2 at large pT as\nobserved in experiments. Specifically, we parameterize \u03b5\nas\n\u03b5(pT ) = c1 exp(\u2212pT /c2 ).\nWe further parameterize the radial flow velocity as\n\u0012 \u0013\nr\n,\n\u03b2(r) = \u03b20\nR0\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere R0 is a parameter related to the transverse size\nof the initial hadron distribution in space and r is the\ndistance of the particle from the origin of the coordinate\nsystem in the transverse plane.\nFor the spatial distribution of the particles produced\nat hadronization, it is assumed to be inside a cylinder\nwith its axis along the longitudinal direction and having\nan elliptic shape in the transverse plane, as only minimum biased collisions are considered in the present study.\nThese particles are further assumed to be uniformly distributed in the transverse plane. This means that the\ninitial hadrons are uniformly distributed in the spatial\nregion of\n\u0010 x \u00112\nA\n\n+\n\n\u0010 y \u00112\nB\n\n\u2264 1.\n\n(8)\n\n\f3\nIn terms of the spatial elliptic anisotropy [9]\n\n+\n\n\u03c0 , expt\n\n2\n\n\u001d\n\n10\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\n\u22121\n\np, initial (\u00d7 10 )\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\np, final (\u00d7 10 )\n\n2\n\nthe spatial region as given by Eq. (8) can be rewritten as\nr \u2264 R0 [1 + s2 cos(2\u03c6)] ,\n\n(10)\n\nleading to\nA = R0 (1 + s2 ),\n\nB = R0 (1 \u2212 s2 ).\n\n(11)\n\nFor the coordinate system defined above, the initial shape\nof the hadronic system in non-central collisions then has\ns2 \u2264 0.\nWe further introduce a formation time \u03c40 for hadrons\nproduced from hadronization as in Ref. [24]. Because of\nboost invariance, the time and the position in z-direction\nof an initial hadron are given by t = \u03c40 cosh y and z =\n\u03c40 sinh y, where y stands for rapidity.\nSince we do not consider the dynamics of partons in\nQGP before hadronization, the number of hadrons in the\ninitial state cannot be determined a priori. We thus treat\nthe initial number of positively charged pions N\u03c0+ as a\nfree parameter so that its number after hadronic rescattering is fitted to the measured pion multiplicity. The\nnumber of other hadrons after hadronization is then determined from the assumption that they are in thermal\nand relative chemical equilibrium with respect to pions.\nFor Au+Au collisions at center of mass energy\n\u221a\nsN N = 200 GeV, the parameters for the initial conditions are taken as follows. For the spatial distribution\nof initial hadrons, we use the parameters\nR0 = 5.0 fm,\n\ns2 = \u22120.05,\n\n\u03c40 = 2.5 fm/c,\n\n(12)\n\nsimilar to the quark distributions obtained in the ampt\nmodel at hadronization. For the transverse momentum distribution, we use the critical temperature TC =\n175 MeV and\n\u03b20 = 0.55,\n\nc1 = 0.43,\n\nc2 = 0.85 GeV/c\n\n(13)\n\nfor the flow velocity parameterized in Eq. (5). The number of initial positively charged pions is taken to be\nN\u03c0+ = 100. This then leads to a proton number of\nNp = 2.5 in the thermal model with zero charge and\nbaryon chemical potentials. These pions and protons as\nwell as other hadrons are then uniformly distributed in\nthe rapidity region |y| < 2.0. The resulting initial transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flows of midrapidity\n(|y| \u2264 0.5) \u03c0 + 's and protons, whose numbers are 71 and\n6.4, respectively after including those from decays of meson and baryon resonances, are shown in Figs. 1 and 2.\nThese results will be compared in the next section with\nthose of the freeze-out pions and protons after hadronic\nscattering.\n\n\u22121\n\np, expt (\u00d7 10 )\n+\n\u03c0 , initial\n+\n\u03c0 , final\n\n2\n\nx2 \u2212 y 2\nx2 + y 2\n\ndN/(2\u03c0pTdpT ) (c /GeV )\n\ns2 =\n\n\u001c\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10 0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\npT (GeV/c)\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Transverse momentum spectra of pions\nand protons in midrapidity |y| < 0.5.

The results\nin the midrapidity region |y| < 0.5 are shown in Fig. 1\nby the dashed and solid lines for pions and protons, respectively, and they are comparable to the experimental\ndata measured by the PHENIX Collaboration [26]. It is\nseen that the final pion and proton transverse momentum spectra are not very different from the initial ones\nshown by the dotted and dash-dotted lines, respectively.\nThis can be understood from the fact that the effect of\ndecreasing temperature of the hadronic matter due to\nexpansion is compensated by an increase in the collective flow velocity. A similar conclusion was drawn in\nRef. [27], where the effect of hadronic rescattering was\nstudied through the hadronic transport model jam [28].\nWe note that the number of pions and protons in midrapidity after hadronic rescattering are N (\u03c0 + ) \u2248 74 and\nN (p) \u2248 5.4, respectively, including those from decays of\nbaryon and meson resonances, and are only slightly different from their initial values.\nIn Fig. 2, the elliptic flow v2 of pions and protons are\nshown by solid lines as functions of transverse momentum. It is seen that our model describes reasonably the\nexperimental data from the PHENIX Collaboration except for pT > 2 GeV/c, where it overestimates the measured pion elliptic flow. We have found that it is very\ndifficult to find the parameters used for the elliptic flow\nin Eq. (5) that would describe both the pion and proton v2 in all pT region. This may not be surprising as\nthe pion and proton elliptic flow at high pT follow the\nquark number scaling and are thus unlikely to be de-\n\n\f4\n0.3\n+\n\n\u03c0 (expt)\n+\n\u03c0 (initial)\n+\n\u03c0 (final)\n\np (expt)\np (initial)\np (final)\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n2\n\nv2\n\nv2\n\n2\n\ndN/(2\u03c0pTdpT) (c /GeV )\n\n0.2\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\npT (GeV/c)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\npT (GeV/c)\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Elliptic flow v2 of pions and protons\nfor rapidities |y| < 0.5.

To overcome this may\nrequire the use of the blast wave model for the quark distributions and the quark coalescence model to generate\nthe initial meson and baryon distributions. In contrast to\nthe transverse momentum spectra, the final pion and proton elliptic flows are different from the initial ones shown\nby dashed lines. One sees that the pion elliptic flow is\nincreased by scattering. For protons, their elliptic flow\nafter scattering also increases at large pT but becomes\nsmaller at low pT , reflecting an enhanced mass-ordering\neffect as a result of increasing radial flow.\n\nIV.\n\nDEUTERON TRANSVERSE MOMENTUM\nSPECTRUM AND ELLIPTIC FLOW\n\nIn this section, we study the pT spectrum of deuterons\nand their elliptic flow. As for other hadrons, we have\nassumed that they are initially produced at hadronization and then undergo hadronic scattering through which\nthey can be annihilated and also reproduced. To include\nthese effects, we have modified the art code embedded in\nthe ampt model as described in detail in the Appendix.\nThe resulting deuteron pT spectrum is given in Fig. 3 by\nthe solid line and is seen in relatively good agreement\nwith the PHENIX data [29]. The calculated deuteron\nnumber of about 0.046 in the midrapidity is, however,\nsomewhat larger than the measured one. Compared with\nthe deuteron initial pT spectrum shown by the dashed\nline, the final one has a larger inverse slope reflecting the\nfurther development of the radial flow of deuterons by\nhadronic rescattering.\nShown in Fig. 4 by the solid line is the calculated final deuteron elliptic flow, which is seen to describe reasonably the experimental data. The negative values of\ndeuteron elliptic flow at low pT (< 1 GeV/c) reported\nby the STAR Collaboration [13] are, however, not reproduced by the present model. We first note that the\ndeuteron elliptic flow from the initial blast wave model\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\nd expt\nd (initial)\nd (transport)\nd (coalescence)\n\n-6\n\n10 0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\npT (GeV/c)\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Transverse momentum spectrum of\ndeuterons in midrapidity |y| < 0.5. Dashed and solid lines\nare for initial and final deuterons, while the dash-dotted line\nis from the coalescence model. Data are from Ref. [29].\n\nshown by the dashed line does have small negative values at very low pT . This is due to following combined\neffects. Because of the larger flow velocity in the reaction plane than out of the reaction plane, deuterons of a\ngiven transverse momentum pT in the fire-cylinder frame\nhave a smaller transverse momentum in the local frame\nif they move in the reaction plane than if they move out\nof the reaction plane. Since the number of deuterons\nwith transverse momentum p\u2032T in the local frame is prois an increasing\u221aor deportional to p\u2032T exp(\u2212m\u2032T /T ), it \u221a\ncreasing function of p\u2032T for p\u2032T . md T or p\u2032T & md T .\nWhile the resulting deuteron v2 is positive in the latter\ncase as there are more deuterons of transverse momentum pT moving in the reaction plane than moving out of\nthe reaction plane, it is negative in the former case. This\neffect is, however, reduced during subsequent hadronic\nscattering as a result of increasing radial flow velocity\nand additional production of deuterons. Indeed, the final deuteron v2 at low pT is close to zero. Similarly,\nthe deuteron elliptic flow at larger pT is reduced after\nhadronic evolution as shown in Fig. 4.\nIn Fig. 5, we show the numbers of protons and\ndeuterons in the midrapidity |y| \u2264 0.5 as functions of\ntime. Both are seen to decrease gradually with time and\nthis is partially due to scattering into larger rapidity regions.\n\nV.\n\nTHE DYNAMICAL COALESCENCE MODEL\n\nIt is of interest to compare the results from the transport model with those from the coalescence model.

The oscillator frequency\nis determined by\np the charge root-mean-square radius of\nthe deuteron,\nhr2 id = 1.96 fm [30], which leads to\n\u22123\n\u03c9 = 8.06 \u00d7 10 GeV. We note that the above deuteron\nWigner function reproduces very well that obtained in\nRef. [30] using a more realistic deuteron wave function.\nThe calculated results for the pT spectrum and elliptic\nflow of midrapidity (|y| \u2264 0.5) deuterons from the coalescence model are shown by dash-dotted lines in Fig. 3\nand Fig. 4, respectively. It is seen that except for small\npT the deuteron pT spectrum in the coalescence model\nagrees almost perfectly with that in the transport model.\nThe total deuteron number in this case is about 0.051\nand is only slightly larger than that from the transport\nmodel. For the deuteron elliptic flow v2 , although the\ntwo models give similar values in the small pT region,\nthe one from the coalescence model is larger at higher pT\nand the deviation between the two becomes larger as pT\nincreases. As a result, the coalescence model does not\ndescribe the experimental data as well as the transport\nmodel. However, neither model could give a negative v2\nfor deuterons with pT < 1.0 GeV/c, contrary to that seen\nin the experimental data from the STAR Collaboration.\n\n0.03\n\n0.02\n\nVI.\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nDEUTERON EMISSION TIME\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nt (fm/c)\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Proton (scaled by a factor of 1/150)\nand deuteron numbers versus time in midrapidity |y| < 0.5.\n\nthe coalescence model, deuterons are produced by recombination of nucleons at freeze-out using the sudden approximation.

The freeze-out times of nucleons are defined in\nthe same way and their distribution is also given in Fig. 6\nfor comparison. In the coalescence model, a deuteron is\nformed from a pair of freeze-out or emitted proton and\nneutron, so its emission time is given by the latest time of\nthe two emitted nucleons. Results given in Fig. 6 show\nthat the distribution of deuteron emission times in the\ntransport model is rather similar to that of nucleons. In\nthe coalescence model, although the deuteron emission\ntime distribution peaks at t \u223c 10 fm/c, similar to that of\nnucleons, the two are otherwise quite different. In particular, there are more deuterons emitted at later times in\nthe transport model than in the coalescence model. We\nnote that the non-smooth deuteron early emission time\ndistribution in the transport model is due to the incomplete destruction of initial deuterons, particularly those\nproduced near the surface of the fire cylinder.

This\nis carried out by modifying the art code in the ampt\nmodel to include the production and annihilation of\ndeuterons via the reactions BB \u2194 dM involving baryons\nand mesons as well as their elastic interactions with\nthese hadrons. For the initial hadron distributions after hadronization of the quark-gluon plasma, we use the\nthermal distribution based on a blast wave model.\nThe initial hadrons are uniformly distributed in an elliptic shape with a spatial elliptic anisotropy of \u22120.05.\nWith the parameters such as the initial temperature as\nwell as the transverse flow velocity and anisotropy fitted to reproduce the measured pT spectra and elliptic\nflows of protons, we have examined the production of\ndeuterons in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The calculated deuteron pT spectrum is comparable to, although\nsomewhat softer than, the experimental data measured\nby the PHENIX Collaboration. The deuteron elliptic\nflow from the transport model also agrees reasonably\nwith that measured by the PHENIX Collaboration. However, the deuteron elliptic flow was found to be positive\nat small pT in contrary to the negative elliptic flow of\ndeuterons observed by the STAR Collaboration.\nWe have also compared our transport model results\nwith those of the coalescence model. While the two give\nvery similar deuteron pT spectra, the elliptic flows obtained in the two model are quite different, particularly\nat high pT . In addition, the coalescence model is found to\ngive almost exact nucleon number scaling of the elliptic\nflow, while the transport model causes a deviation of the\nelliptic flow from the exact nucleon number scaling, which\nis, however, closer to the measured data. These results,\nincluding the non-negative values of the elliptic flow at\nvery small pT , are not much changed if the cross sections\nfor deuteron production and scattering are changed by a\nfactor of two.\nOur study has raised two interesting questions on\ndeuteron production in relativistic heavy ion collisions.\nOne is the relation between the transport model and\nthe coalescence model for deuteron production, and the\nother concerns the negative deuteron elliptic flow at\nlow pT . Since the binding energy of deuteron is small\n(\u223c 2.2 MeV), the coalescence model has been considered\nan appropriate approach to describe deuteron production\nin nuclear reactions [32]. This is indeed the case in our\nstudy for the deuteron transverse momentum spectrum\nas the two models give very similar results. However, the\ndeuteron elliptic flows from these two models are quite\n\n\f7\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grant No. PHY-0758115 and the\nWelch Foundation under Grant No. A-1358.\n\nAPPENDIX: REACTIONS FOR DEUTERON\nPRODUCTION, ANNIHILATION, AND ELASTIC\nSCATTERING\n\nThe art code [21, 22, 23] implemented in the ampt\ncode includes the interactions of \u03c0, K, \u03b7, \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c6, K \u2217 , N ,\n\u2206(1232), S11 (1535), P11 (1440) as well as their antiparticles. To extend the model to include deuteron production\nand annihilation, we modify the art code to incorporate\nfollowing reactions,\nBB \u2032 \u2192 M d,\n\nM d \u2192 BB \u2032 ,\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere M = \u03c0, \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03b7, and B and B \u2032 stand for baryons\nN , \u2206, P11 (1440), and S11 (1535). For the cross sections\nof the reactions BB \u2032 \u2192 M d, we assume that their angular integrated mean squared matrix elements that are\naveraged over initial and summed over final spins and\nisospins are the same as that for the reaction N N \u2192 d\u03c0\nat same center of mass energies. The cross sections for\nthe inverse reactions M d \u2192 BB \u2032 are then determined\nfrom the detailed balance. Experimentally, the cross sections for both the reaction pp \u2192 d\u03c0 + [33, 34] and the\n\n2\n\n10\n\n+\n\n\u03c3(d\u03c0 \u2192 pp) expt\n+\n\u03c3(pp \u2192 d\u03c0 ) expt\n\n1\n\n10\n\n\u03c3 (mb)\n\ndifferent, with the transport model giving a better description of the experimental data in comparison with\nthe coalescence model. Part of this difference may be due\nto the neglect of rescattering of deuterons produced in\nthe coalescence model. Although deuterons are produced\nfrom freeze-out nucleons in the coalescence model, they\nmay undergo additional scattering in the hadronic matte,\nleading to a later emission time as results from the transport model have shown. As to the negative deuteron elliptic flow observed in the preliminary experimental data,\nit is not seen in either the transport model or the coalescence model. The lack of negative deuteron elliptic\nflow in the coalescence model is expected as a negative\ndeuteron elliptic flow requires a negative nucleon elliptic\nflow, which is not observed in the experimental data. In\nthe transport model, a negative deuteron elliptic flow is\npossible if the final radial flow velocity is smaller than\nthat reached in the present study, following the discussions in the end of Section IV. Whether this can still lead\nto a good description of the measured deuteron transverse momentum spectrum needs to be checked. Further\ninvestigations both in theory and experiment are thus\nrequired to understand the elliptic flow of deuterons at\nlow pT and to shed more light on the mechanisms for the\nproduction of low pT hadrons in relativistic heavy ion\ncollisions.\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n\u221as (GeV)\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\nFIG. 8: (Color online) Experimental data on the total cross\nsections for pp \u2192 d\u03c0 + [33, 34] and for d\u03c0 + \u2192 pp [35, 36, 37].\nThe solid and dashed lines are the parametrization given in\nthe text.\n\nreaction \u03c0 + d \u2192 pp [35, 36, 37] have been measured, and\nthe former can be parameterized as\n\u03c3(pp \u2192 d\u03c0 + ) =\n\n1 p\u03c0\nf (s),\n4 pN\n\n(A.2)\n\nwhere pN and p\u03c0 are, respectively, the magnitude of the\nthree-momenta of initial and final particles in the center\nof mass frame.
