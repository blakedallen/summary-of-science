We\npresent a realistic model for exciton dynamics in InGaAs/GaAs QDMs under intense laser excitation and applied\nelectric fields. The dynamics is obtained by solutions of the Lindblad master equation. A map of the dressed ground\nstate as function of laser energy and applied electric field exhibits rich structure that includes excitonic anticrossings\nthat permit the identification of the relevant couplings. The optical signatures of the dipole-dipole F\u00f6rster energy\ntransfer mechanism show as splittings of several (spatially) indirect excitonic lines. Moreover, we construct a model\nfor exciton qubit rotations by adiabatic electric field cyclic sweeps into a F\u00f6rster-tunneling regime which induces level\nanticrossings. The proposed qubit exhibits Rabi oscillations among two well-defined exciton pairs as function of the\nresidence time at the anticrossing.\nKey words: Quantum dot molecules, Excitons, Rabi oscillations, F\u00f6rster energy transfer\nPACS: 73.21.La, 78.67.Hc, 71.35.-y, 42.50.-p\n\nAn interesting proposal for solid state quantum\ngate realization is a quantum dot molecule (QDM),\na device that may be fabricated by vertically coupled pairs of self-assembled quantum dots [1]. QDMs\nare promising candidates for quantum information\ndevices due to their ability to allow coherent control\nof spin and charge degrees of freedom of optically\npumped excitons within the constituent dots [2].\nIn this paper we model the exciton dynamics and\ninvestigate the optical signatures of quantum dot\nmolecules consisting of two InGaAs/GaAs quantum\ndots under strong laser excitation and applied electric fields. We devote special attention to the optical\nsignatures arising from the interplay of interdot tunneling and interdot dipole-dipole interactions that\ngive origin to the F\u00f6rster energy transfer mechanism\n[3]. We incorporate realistic Coulomb energies that\n1\n\nalready include effects consistent with the experimental finding that strain effects break the symmetry of the two dots [4].\nThe Hamiltonian of the system is projected in\nthe excitonic basis constructed from direct products of single particle electron and hole states,\n|eT (B) i,|hT (B) i. The subscripts T and B indicate\nsingle particles localized at the top and bottom\ndot respectively and |0i indicates the vacuum. The\nHamiltonian can be simplified in the rotating wave\napproximation, and by performing a unitary transformation that removes the fast oscillating matrix\nelements [5]. We consider exciton states with up to\nfour particles, including single excitons and biexcitons. In the case of a large biexciton detuning, the\nHamiltonian can be written in terms of \u03a9T (B) (t) =\nh\u03bcT (B) * E(t)i, where \u03bcT (B) are the electric dipole\nmoments for the top (bottom) dots, describing the\n\nE-mail: rolon@helios.phy.ohiou.edu\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\n19 May 2019\n\n\fd\u03c1\u0302\ni\n= \u2212 [\u0124, \u03c1\u0302] + L\u0302relax (\u03c1\u0302) ,\ndt\n~\n\ncoupling of direct excitons transitions to the light\nelectric field E(t), whereas th and te describe the\nhole and electron tunnelings.

With the solution of (4) we\nconstructed a map of the Hamiltonian \"dressed\"\nground state occupation as a function of laser excitation energy and applied electric field, see Fig. 1.\n\nThe Hamiltonian diagonal elements contain the detuning of the exciton energies with respect to the\npumping laser energy; in particular for excitons with\nindirect character,\nBT\nBT\n\u03b4eh\n= EeB \u2212 EhT + Ueh\n+ \u2206Es \u2212 ~\u03c9\nTB\nTB\n\u03b4eh\n= EeT \u2212 EhB + Ueh\n\u2212 \u2206Es \u2212 ~\u03c9 ,\n(2)\nwhere we have included the Stark shift \u2206Es = pF ,\nfor a given applied electric field F and exciton dipole\nmoment p \u223c ed, d being the interdot distance (in\nwhat follows, we use d = 6nm ). We assume the direct exciton confined Stark shift to be vanishingly\nsmall, so that only Stark shifts on the indirect excitons are visible [6].\nFor typical self-assembled quantum dots, the\nexciton transition dipole moments \u03bcT and \u03bcB\nare parallel to each other, normal to the growth\ndirection, and found theoretically and experimentally to be \u03bcT (B) \u223c 30Debye (= 6.2 e\u00c5) [7]. As a\nconsequence of these values and geometry, strong\nexciton-radiation coupling and dipole-dipole interaction may take place for direct excitons. The latter\ngives origin to the F\u00f6rster resonant energy transfer\nmechanism, in which a donor quantum dot transfers\nits exciton energy to the neighboring dot, allowing\nfor non-radiative interdot exciton hoping [8]. The\nF\u00f6rster coupling VF takes then the form\n\nFig. 1. Ground state occupation map including biexcitonic\nsignatures. Red color indicates maximum occupation, while\ngreen-blue color, minimum occupation. The arrows at S indicate the indirect biexcitonic splitting due to the F\u00f6rster\nenergy transfer coupling VF , while \u2206 = 2.5meV indicates\nsplitting at the main anticrossing between excitons |eB hB i\nand |eT hB i and between |eT hT i and |eB hT i. We have assumed an interband dipole moment of 30Debye.\n\nWe find rich structure in this map that includes\nexcitonic molecular level anticrossings. The molecular hybridization-like behavior comes via first order\nprocesses like single particle tunneling and second\norder processes like the F\u00f6rster interaction, such\nthat the anticrossing behavior in the map shows\nthe mixing of indirect excitons and direct excitons.\nInterestingly, the F\u00f6rster coupling is found to split\nseveral four-particle (spatially) indirect excitonic\nlines, in addition to the expected splitting of single\ndirect excitons. This signature, indicated by \u2206 in\nFig. 1, has not been predicted before. We propose\nthat a detailed experimental set up could look for\nthis signature, in spite of having possibly a smaller\nvalue due to a weaker spectral overlap between the\ndonor/acceptor excitons. Clearly the effect is larger\nfor larger transition dipole moments.\n\ne2\nOT B \u03bcT * \u03bcB ,\n(3)\n4\u03c0\u000f0 \u000fr d3\nwhere \u000fr is the dielectric constant of the QD and\nhost material. Assuming unity interdot overlap integrals between T and B excitons, OT B \u223c 1, and\nd = 6nm, one obtains VF \u223c 2.5meV , while the interdot tunnelings assume values of th = 1meV and\nte = 14.5meV , respectively. The similarity of these\nvalues suggests one can look for an experimentally\ndetectable signature of the F\u00f6rster interaction.\nTo obtain the dynamics of the full system including decoherence processes we use the Lindblad master equation [9]\nVF = \u2212\n\n2\n\n\f(with period ' 1/\u2206) signal that one can in principle initialize and rotate at will the set of excitons\nstates that define suitable qubits. As the initialization and rotation is done by optoelectronic means,\nthe desirable last step of qubit readout is also in\nprinciple possible by monitoring the Stark-shifted\nluminescence of the system.\n\nTo investigate the possible realization of a quantum gate, we exploit the fact that it is possible to\nidentify which excitons mix at a given anticrossing.\n[As the splitting at the main anticrossing does not\nchange appreciably by the presence of the biexciton\nstate, we ignore the latter in the following for numerical simplicity.] We prepared an input state consisting of selectively excited excitons |eT hT i,|eT hB i\nplus the vacuum state |00i. The dynamics starts at\nt = 0, with an empty molecule state, |00i, as the\nradiation turns on. We integrate the dynamics until the transients disappear, and define an starting\nconfiguration (ti > 0), so that the input state is prepared as superposition\n|\u03a8I i = c00 |00i + ceT hB |eT hB i + ceB hB |eB hB i . (5)\nFor ta > ti , we then turn on an adiabatic ramp of the\nelectric field, F (t) until t = tac , see Fig. 2. The electric field sweep correspond to a change from F0 =\n\u221222.5kV /cm, far away from the level anticrossing\n(see Fig. 1), to a final value F (tac ) = 7kV /cm at the\nanticrossing.\n\nFig. 3. Rabi oscillations of two qubit candidates, the pair\nof excitons, |00i, |eT hB i (green,black) and |eT hT i, |eB hT i\n(blue,red). In the background, the exciton |eB hB i (pink)\nmay lead to a noisy manipulation of the desired qubits\n\nWe have investigated a model for a quantum dot\nmolecule under strong laser illumination and applied\nelectric fields. We have used realistic parameters and\nhave found interesting optical signatures deriving\nfrom a competition between single particle tunneling and the exciton F\u00f6rster energy transfer mechanism, with possible means to identify its signature.\nWe have found that with careful sweep cycles of the\nelectric field, it is possible to achieve a basic quantum gate that rotates the proposed qubit consisting\nof two pairs of exciton states.\n\nFig. 2. Electric field sweep cycle, at fixed laser energy\n~\u03c9 = 1300meV , drives the system away from the anticrossing point at F0 = F (ti ) = \u221222.5kV /cm to the anticrossing\nat F (tac ) = 7kV /cm. The QDM evolves by itself at the anticrossing for a residence time tR . This cycle is repeated for\nseveral different tR values.\n\nAt t = tac we fix the electric field (stop the gate\npulse) and let the system evolve during a \"residence\"\ntime, tR . Finally, after t > tR + tac we drive the system back to the original configuration (initial electric field) and perform time averages of the resulting\noutput superposition. We repeated the mentioned\ncycle for several distinct residence times tR and obtained the average probability of having recovered\nthe different components in |\u03a8I i. We observe clear\nRabi oscillations vs tR , predominantly among two\npairs of exciton states: |00i, |eT hB i (logic 0) and\n|eT hT i, |eB hT i (logic 1) with a weak background signal given by the optical population of the |eB hB i exciton state, thus resembling the evolution of a noisy\nquasi-two level system, see Fig. 3.
