Searching for structural reasons behind old results and conjectures of Chudnovksy\nregarding the least degree of a nonzero form in an ideal of fat points in PN , we make conjectures\nwhich explain them, and we prove the conjectures in certain cases, including the case of general\npoints in P2 . Our conjectures were also partly motivated by the Eisenbud-Mazur Conjecture on\nevolutions, which concerns symbolic squares of prime ideals in local rings, but in contrast we consider\nhigher symbolic powers of homogeneous ideals in polynomial rings.\n\n1. Introduction\nBoth authors of this paper have been interested for many years in the behavior of symbolic\npowers of ideals in regular rings, especially in polynomial rings. In the case of defining ideals of\npoints, symbolic powers are special cases of ideals of so-called fat points, and their study provides a\nmeeting ground of geometry and algebra. Hereafter R will denote the ring K[x0 , . . . , xN ] = K[PN ]\nwhere K is a field and I \u2286 R will be a homogeneous ideal, with M = (x0 , . . . , xN ) being the\nmaximal homogeneous ideal in R. Many of our arguments hold for arbitrary fields, but in some\ncases the field K must be infinite. By symbolic power we mean I (m) = R \u2229 (\u2229P (I m )P ) where the\nintersections take place in the field of fractions of K[PN ], and the second intersection is over all\nassociated primes P of I. An important special case is that of ideals of fat points; i.e., I = \u2229i I(pi )mi\nfor non-negative integers mi and a finite set of distinct points pi \u2208 PN , where I(pi ) is the ideal\ngenerated by all forms that vanish at pi . In this case I (m) is just \u2229i I(pi )mmi . When PN is clear,\nwe denote the subscheme defined by I by Z = m1 p1 + * * * + mn pn , and denote its ideal I by I(Z).\nIn this case, I (m) becomes I(mZ).\nIf J is a homogeneous ideal, we let \u03b1(J) be the least degree of a polynomial in J. Let I be the\nradical ideal of a finite set of points in PN . Using complex analytic techniques, Waldschmidt and\nSkoda [W1, Sk] showed that\n\u03b1(I (m) )/m \u2265 \u03b1(I)/N\n(\u25e6 )\nfor every m > 0. Interestingly, this result also follows for any homogeneous ideal I \u2286 R = K[PN ]\nbecause I (N m) \u2286 I m by [ELS], [HH1] and clearly (I (m) )N \u2286 I (mN ) . These containments imply\nthat N \u03b1(I (m) ) = \u03b1((I (m) )N ) \u2265 \u03b1(I (N m) ) \u2265 \u03b1(I m ) = m\u03b1(I), so \u03b1(I (m) )/m \u2265 \u03b1(I (N m) )/(N m) \u2265\n\u03b1(I)/N .\nWhen N = 2, Chudnovsky [Ch] improved the bound of Waldschmidt and Skoda [W1, Sk]. Since\nonly a sketch of Chudnovksy's proof is given in [Ch], we later give a proof (see Proposition 3.1).\nChudnovsky's improvement is the following: Let p1 , . . . , pn \u2208 P2 be distinct points. Let I =\n\u2229i I(pi ) \u2282 K[P2 ]. Then \u03b1(I (m) )/m \u2265 (\u03b1(I) + 1)/2 for all m > 0.\n\nDate: September 8, 2011.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

This led us to our first conjecture,\nwhich gives a structural reason for the result of Chudnovsky. Namely, we conjecture that I (2r) \u2286\nM r I r for an ideal I of points in P2 . This conjecture, which we prove for general points (see\nProposition 3.10), easily implies the result of Chudnovsky. We generalize this conjecture in a natural\nway to arbitrary dimension. As it turns out, a positive answer to our more general conjecture also\ngives a positive answer to a conjecture of Chudnovsky, that if I is the ideal of a finite set of points\nin K[PN ], then \u03b1(I (m) )/m \u2265 (\u03b1(I) + N \u2212 1)/N .\nOur conjecture relates to evolutions. Evolutions are certain kinds of ring homomorphisms that\narose in proving Fermat's Last Theorem [F, TW, Wi]; see [B] for an exposition. An important step\nin the proof was to show in certain cases only trivial evolutions occurred. Eisenbud and Mazur\n[EM] showed the question of triviality (which for the work of Wiles was in mixed characteristic)\ncould be translated into a statement involving symbolic powers. They then made the following\nconjecture in characteristic 0:\nConjecture 1.1 (Eisenbud-Mazur). Let P \u2282 C[[x1 , . . . , xd ]] be a prime ideal. Then P (2) \u2286 M P ,\nwhere M = (x1 , . . . , xd ).\nOur main conjecture can at least heuristically be thought of as a generalization of the conjecture\nof Eisenbud-Mazur to higher symbolic powers. The homogeneous version of Conjecture 1.1 for\nsymbolic squares is easy to verify:\nFact 1.2. Let I \u2286 K[x0 , . . . , xN ] be a proper homogeneous ideal where char(K) = 0. Then I (2) \u2286\nM I.\nProof. For any F \u2208 I (2) we have \u2202F/\u2202xi \u2208 I; if char(K) = 0, then by the Euler identity we have\nP\ndeg(F )F = i xi \u2202F/\u2202xi \u2208 M I, so I (2) \u2286 M I.\n\u0003\nThe general question we wish to raise is:\n\nQuestion 1.3. Let I \u2282 R be a homogeneous ideal. For which m, i and j do we have I (m) \u2286 M j I i ?\nA complete answer will typically depend on I, but it is also of interest to ask what holds for\nall I, knowing only N . Since M j I i \u2286 I i , we see that whenever I (m) \u2286 M j I i is true we also have\nI (m) \u2286 I i . It is known that I (m) \u2286 I i holds whenever m/i \u2265 N [ELS], also [HH1], and that\nwhenever m/i < N , there exist ideals I for which I (mt) \u2286 I it fails for t \u226b 0 [BH1].\nThus an interesting starting point is:\nQuestion 1.4. Let I \u2282 R be a homogeneous ideal. For which j does I (rN ) \u2286 M j I r hold for all I\nand all r?\nThe best known general results concerning this question are found in [HH2] and [TY].\nIn Section 2 we state our main conjecture, and prove it in a very special case. Section 3 gives the\nproof of the result of Chudnovsky, which we then slightly generalize and relate to the Noetherian\nproperty for symbolic power algebras. We prove our conjecture for general points in P2 . The\nlast section relates our work to a conjecture of the first author, and has further speculations and\nexamples.\n\n2. An optimistic conjecture\nNote that I (rN ) \u2286 M j I r fails in general if j > r(N \u2212 1), even for I = M . So the best we can\nhope for is:\n\n\fARE SYMBOLIC POWERS HIGHLY EVOLVED?\n\n3\n\nConjecture 2.1. Let I = \u2229i I(pi )mi \u2282 K[PN ] be any fat points ideal. Then I (rN ) \u2286 M r(N \u22121) I r\nholds for all r > 0.\nIn fact, as far we know, there is no reason not to raise this question for arbitrary homogeneous\nideals in a polynomial ring, or even for arbitrary ideals in a regular local ring. In this paper, all our\nmain arguments are for the case of points, so we have chosen not to make the general conjecture\nunless more evidence can be found that supports it.\nIn fact, Proposition 3.3 shows that the conjecture is true for N = 2 for fat point ideals arising as\nsymbolic powers of radical ideals generated in a single degree. Examples of point sets whose ideals\u0001\nare generated in a single degree include star configurations (see Definition 3.8) and any set of 2s\ngeneral points in P2 .\nMost of our progress on this conjecture relates to the minimal degrees of elements in symbolic\npowers. We need the following definition.\nDefinition 2.2. Let R be a polynomial ring over a field, and let J be a homogeneous ideal. We set\n\u03b1(J) equal to the smallest integer l such that Jl 6= 0, and set \u03b2(J) equal to the smallest integer n\nsuch that Jn contains a regular sequence of length two.\nWe first note that the conjecture holds provided we know some information about the symbolic\npowers.\nProposition 2.3. Let J = \u2229i I(pi ) \u2282 R = K[PN ] and let I = J (m) \u2282 R be a fat points ideal. If\nfor some s, J is generated by a set of homogeneous elements each having degree at most s, and if\n\u03b1(I (N r) ) \u2265 rms + rm(N \u2212 1), then I (N r) \u2286 M r(N \u22121) I r .\n\nProof. We use that J (N mr) \u2286 J mr by [ELS] (also see [HH1]). Since J is generated in degree\ns and less, so J mr is generated in degree at most mrs, and hence Jtmr = (M mr(N \u22121) J mr )t for\n(N mr)\n\u2286 (M mr(N \u22121) J mr )t for t < \u03b1(J (N mr) ), while for\nt \u2265 mrs + mr(N \u2212 1). Of course, 0 = Jt\n(N\nmr)\n(N\nr)\nt \u2265 \u03b1(J\n) = \u03b1(I\n) \u2265 rms + rm(N \u2212 1) we have (J (N mr) )t \u2286 (J mr )t = (M mr(N \u22121) J mr )t and\nso I (N r) = J (N mr) \u2286 M mr(N \u22121) J mr \u2286 M r(N \u22121) I r .\n\u0003\n3. Points in projective space\nAs discussed in the introduction, if I is the radical ideal of a finite set of points in PN , Waldschmidt and Skoda [W1, Sk] showed that \u03b1(I (m) )/m \u2265 \u03b1(I)/N for every m > 0, using complex\nanalysis, but it also follows for any homogeneous ideal I \u2286 R = K[PN ] using the result I (N m) \u2286 I m\nof [ELS], [HH1]. Among other things, the algebraic argument suggests that Conjecture 2.1 is closely\nrelated to the study of \u03b1(I (m) ).\nWhen N = 2, Chudnovsky improved the bound of Waldschmidt and Skoda [W1, Sk]. Since only\na sketch of Chudnovksy's proof is given in [Ch], we give both the statement and proof here. We\nwill give a small improvement of this result in Proposition 3.5.\nProposition 3.1 (Chudnovsky). Let p1 , . . . , pn \u2208 P2 be distinct points. Let I = \u2229i I(pi ) \u2282 K[P2 ].\nThen\n\u03b1(I (m) )\n\u03b1(I) + 1\n\u2265\nm\n2\nfor all m > 0.\nProof. Let b = \u03b1(I). Choose distinct points q1 , . . . , qt \u2208 {p1 , . . . , pn } with t as small as possible\nsuch that \u03b1(J) = b, where J = \u2229\u0001i I(qi ). By minimality, the points qi impose independent conditions\nin degree b \u2212 1, hence t = b+1\n(since this is the dimension of the space of all forms of degree\n2\nb \u2212 1) and \u03b1(J) = reg(J). Thus J is generated in degree b and hence the only base points of Jb\nare the points qi ; in particular, Jb is fixed component free (i.e., there is no nonconstant common\n(m)\nfactor for the homogeneous elements of J of degree b). Now let A be a nonzero form in Ia , where\n\n\f4\n\nBRIAN HARBOURNE & CRAIG HUNEKE\n\na = \u03b1(I (m) ). Since Jb is fixed component free, we can choose an element B \u2208 Jb with no factor\nin\nb+1\u0001\ncommon with A. By B\u00e9zout's Theorem, it follows that ab = deg(A) deg(B) \u2265 mt = m 2 , and\nhence that \u03b1(I (m) ) = a \u2265 (b + 1)/2 = (\u03b1(I) + 1)/2.\n\u0003\nOur original motivation for Conjecture 2.1 was exactly this result of Chudnovsky. Just as the\ncontainment result I (rN ) \u2286 I r of [HH1] implies the bound \u03b1(I (m) )/m \u2265 \u03b1(I)/N of Waldschmidt\nand Skoda, we looked for a new containment which in a similar way would imply the bound in\nProposition 3.1. In addition to the result of Proposition 3.1, Chudnovsky [Ch] has conjectured for\nN > 2 that \u03b1(I (m) )/m \u2265 (\u03b1(I) + N \u2212 1)/N (actually his conjecture was stated for K = C for\npoints in affine N -space). We now show that Conjecture 2.1 implies not only Proposition 3.1 but\nalso \u03b1(I (m) )/m \u2265 (\u03b1(I) + N \u2212 1)/N .\nLemma 3.2. Let p1 , . . . , pn \u2208 PN be distinct points, and let I = \u2229i I(pi ) \u2282 K[PN ]. If I (N r) \u2286\nM r(N \u22121) I r holds for all r \u2265 1, then \u03b1(I (m) )/m \u2265 (\u03b1(I) + N \u2212 1)/N holds for all m \u2265 1.\nWe pause to recall a numerical quantity introduced by Waldschmidt [W1] for sets of points, but\nwhich extends to homogeneous ideals 0 6= I \u2282 K[PN ]. Define\n\u03b1(I (m) )\n.\nm\u2192\u221e\nm\n\n\u03b3(I) = lim\nThe limit exists and satisfies \u03b3(I) \u2264\nWe now prove Lemma 3.2.\n\n\u03b1(I (m) )\nm\n\nfor all m \u2265 1; see [BH1, Lemma 2.3.1] and its proof.\n\nProof. Since I (N r) \u2286 M r(N \u22121) I r , we have \u03b1(I (N r) ) \u2265 \u03b1(M r(N \u22121) I r ) = r\u03b1(I) + r(N \u2212 1). Now\ndivide by rN and take limits as r \u2192 \u221e to get \u03b1(I (m) )/m \u2265 \u03b3(I) = (\u03b1(I) + N \u2212 1)/N .\n\u0003\nConversely, we can also use Proposition 3.1 to prove certain cases of Conjecture 2.1.\nProposition 3.3. Let J = \u2229i I(pi ) \u2282 K[PN ] and let I = J (m) \u2282 R be a fat points ideal. If N = 2\nand if J is generated in degree \u03b1(J), then I (N r) \u2286 M r(N \u22121) I r for all r.\nProof. Let s = \u03b1(J); then \u03b1(J (N mr) ) \u2265 mrs+mr(N \u22121) by Proposition 3.1. Now apply Proposition\n2.3.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.4. Given I = \u2229i I(pi ) for any distinct points p1 , . . . , pn \u2208 PN for N > 2, if Chudnovsky's\nconjecture [Ch] \u03b1(I (m) )/m \u2265 (\u03b1(I) + N \u2212 1)/N holds, then the proof of Proposition 3.3 would work\nfor any N , not just N = 2.\nWe next refine Proposition 3.1 by bringing into play \u03b2(I (m) ).\nProposition 3.5. Let Let p1 , . . . , pn \u2208 P2 be distinct points. Let I = \u2229i I(pi ) \u2282 K[P2 ] = R. Set\n\u03b1m = \u03b1(I (m) ), and \u03b2m = \u03b2(I (m) ). Then we have:\n(i) \u03b1m \u03b2m \u2265 m2 n, and\n(ii)\n\n\u03b1m \u0010 \u03b11 + 1 \u0011\u0010 m\u03b11 \u0011\n\u2265\n.\nm\n2\n\u03b2m\n\nMoreover, if \u03b1m \u03b2m = m2 n, then (I (m) )k = I (mk) for all k \u2265 1.\nProof. We first prove that \u03b1m \u03b2m \u2265 m2 n, which is basically by B\u00e9zout's theorem. Let l be a general\n(m) which form a regular sequence.\nlinear form. Choose f of degree\nP\u03b1m and g of degree \u03b2m in I\nThen \u03b1m \u03b2m = l(R/(f, g, l)) = P l(P /(f, g)P )l(R/(P, l)), where the sum is over all prime ideals\nminimal over the ideal (f, g). Since such P include all the ideals corresponding to the points\np1 , . . . , pn , we can restrict the sum to P1 , . . . , Pn , where Pi = I(pi ). In this case, l((R/(Pi , l)) = 1\n\n\fARE SYMBOLIC POWERS HIGHLY EVOLVED?\n\n5\n\nfor each i, and l(RPi /(f, g)Pi ) \u2265 m2 since RPi is a regular local ring and by assumption, the images\nof f and g are in (Pim )Pi 1 . This gives the first inequality.\nTo prove the second inequality, we use the idea from the proof of Proposition 3.1. As in that proof,\nchoose distinct points q1 , . . . , qt \u2208 {p1 , . . . , pn } with t as small as possible such that \u03b1(J) = \u03b1(I),\n\u0001\nwhere J = \u2229i I(qi ). As above, t = \u03b1(I)+1\n, and \u03b1(J) = reg(J). Thus J is generated in degree \u03b1(I).\n2\n\u0001\n(m)\n(m)\nNote that I\n\u2282 J , and so \u03b1m \u03b2m \u2265 \u03b1(J (m)) )\u03b2(J (m) ) \u2265 m2 \u03b1(I)+1\n, using the first inequality of\n2\nthis theorem. This proves the second inequality.\nFinally we prove the last part. Suppose that \u03b1m \u03b2m = m2 n. Choose f and g as in the first part\nof this theorem. We use the ideas of Theorem 3.1 of [Hu], which cannot be used directly since it\ndeals with the local case of a prime ideal.\nTo show I (mk) = (I (m) )k for all k \u2265 1, since (f, g)k\u22121 I (m) \u2286 (I (m) )k \u2286 I (mk) , it's enough to show\n(mk)\nI\n= (f, g)k\u22121 I (m) . To prove this note that (f, g)k\u22121 I (m) \u2282 I (mk) , so it suffices to prove the\nequality locally at each associated prime of (f, g)k\u22121 I (m) . We prove that the associated primes of\nthis ideal are exactly the primes ideals Pi = Ipi . Clearly each of these are associated since they\nare minimal over the ideal. To prove they are all the associated primes, we use induction on k.\nIf k = 0, this is clear by the definition of symbolic powers. For k \u2265 1, (f, g)k\u22121 /(f, g)k\u22121 I (m) \u223c\n=\n(f, g)k\u22121 /(f, g)k \u2297 R/I (m) since (f, g)k \u2282 (f, g)k\u22121 I (m) , and the tensor product is isomorphic to\na free R/I (m) -module as (f, g)k\u22121 /(f, g)k is a free R/(f, g)-module because f, g form a regular\nsequence. Hence the only associated primes of (f, g)k\u22121 /(f, g)k\u22121 I (m) are P1 , . . . , Pn . Now the\nexact sequence\n0 \u2192 (f, g)k\u22121 /(f, g)k\u22121 I (m) \u2192 R/(f, g)k\u22121 I (m) \u2192 R/(f, g)k\u22121 \u2192 0\n\nshows that the associated primes of R/(f, g)k\u22121 I (m) are contained in the union of the associated\nprimes of (f, g)k\u22121 /(f, g)k\u22121 I (m) together with the associated primes of R/(f, g)k\u22121 . Since the\nassociated primes of R/(f, g)k\u22121 are exactly those of R/(f, g), to finish the proof of our claim we\nneed to prove that all the associated primes of (f, g) are P1 , . . . , Pn . As this ideal is unmixed,\nthis is equivalent to proving that the only points\nboth f and g vanish at are P1 , . . . , Pn . Recall\nP\nfrom above that \u03b1m \u03b2m = l(R/(f, g, l)) =\nP l(RP /(f, g)P )l(R/(P, l)), where the sum is over\nall prime\nideals\nminimal\nover\nthe\nideal\n(f,\ng).\nSince we are assuming that \u03b1m \u03b2m = m2 n, and\nP\n2\nsince Pi l(RPi /(f, g)Pi )l(R/(Pi , l)) \u2265 m n, we see that the only primes minimal over (f, g) are\nP1 , . . . , Pn .\nTo finish the proof, we need to prove that (I (mk) )Pi = ((f, g)k\u22121 I (m) )Pi for every i. We know\nfrom the fact equality holds that l(RPi /(f, g)Pi ) = m2 . However the multiplicity of (Pi )m\nPi is exactly\nm\n2\nm , and since (f, g)Pi \u2282 (Pi )Pi , it follows from Rees's theorem [SH, Theorem 11.3.1] that (f, g)Pi\nis a minimal reduction of (Pim )Pi . Moreover, (I (m) )Pi = (Pim )Pi is integrally closed. By the result\nof Lipman and Teissier [LT], the result follows.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.6. The second inequality of Proposition 3.5 can be thought of as an improvement of\nProposition 3.1 in the case in which \u03b2(I (m) ) < \u03b1(I)m. However, the proof actually shows that\n!\n\u03b1(I (m) ) \u0010 \u03b1(I) + 1 \u0011 \u03b1(I)m\n,\n(\u2217 )\n\u2265\nm\n2\n\u03b2(J (m) )\nwhere J is as in the proof. Moreover, \u03b2(J (m) ) \u2264 \u03b1(I)m, since J is generated in degree \u03b1(J) = \u03b1(I),\nand J m \u2282 J (m) . Thus (\u2217 ) does represent a small improvement on the orginal result of Chudnovsky.\nIn fact, suppose that equality occurs in Chudnovksy's bound, so that\n\n\u03b1(I (m) )\nm\n\n=\n\n\u03b1(I)+1\n.\n2\n\nThen\n\n1In general, if (R, M ) is a regular local ring and if x , . . . , x \u2208 M n form a maximal regular sequence, then\n1\nd\nl(R/(x1 , . . . , xd )) \u2265 nd . This can be seen, for example, as follows. If I denotes the integral closure of the\nideal (x1 , . . . , xd ), then I \u2282 M n as the latter ideal is integrally closed. Hence the multiplicity of I, which is\nl(R/(x1 , . . . , xd )), is at least the multiplicity of M n , which is nd .\n\n\f6\n\nBRIAN HARBOURNE & CRAIG HUNEKE\n\n)m, so that equality must\nnecessarily \u03b1(I)m = \u03b2(J (m) ) by (\u2217 ). But \u03b1(I (m) ) \u2265 \u03b1(J (m) ) \u2265 ( \u03b1(J)+1\n2\n\u0001\n\u03b1(I)+1\n(m)\n(m)\n2\nhold and we obtain that \u03b1(J )\u03b2(J ) = m\n. Therefore by Proposition 3.5, it follows\n2\nthat (J (m) )k = J (mk) for all k \u2265 1.\nRemark 3.7. The last conclusion in Theorem 3.5 implies that the symbolic power algebra, \u2295I (n)\nis a Noetherian ring. (This is a homogeneous version of [Sc, Theorem 1.3].)\nDefinition 3.8. Let H1 , . . . , Hs \u2208 PN\u0001 be s \u2265 N hyperplanes such that no N + 1 meet at a single\npoint, and let p1 , . . . , pn be the n = Ns points such that each point is the intersection of a subset of\nN of the s hyperplanes; following a suggestion of Geramita, we refer to such a set of points pi as a\nstar configuration for s hyperplanes in PN (since 5 general lines in the plane if drawn appropriately\ngive a 5 pointed star).\nWe now show that Conjecture 2.1 and the conjecture of Chudnovsky mentioned in Remark 3.4\nboth hold for star configurations. In fact, we show more.\n\u0001\nCorollary 3.9. Let I = \u2229i I(pi ) where the n = Ns points pi \u2208 PN give a star configuration coming\n(r)\n\n\u22121\nand I (N r) \u2286 M r(N \u22121) I r hold for all r \u2265 1,\nfrom s \u2265 N hyperplanes in PN . Then \u03b1(Ir ) \u2265 \u03b1(I)+N\nN\nwith equality in the former when r is a multiple of N . If moreover N = 2 and m > 0 is an even\ninteger, then: equality holds in (\u2217 ) of Remark 3.6; \u03b1(I (m) )\u03b2(I (m) ) = m2 n; and \u03b1(I)k = \u03b2(I (k) ) and\n(I (m) )k = I (mk) hold for all k \u2265 1.\n\nProof. We have \u03b1(I (N r) ) = sr by [BH1, Lemma 2.4.1], so \u03b3(I) = limr\u2192\u221e \u03b1(I (rN ) )/(rN ) = s/N ,\nbut we also have reg(J) = \u03b1(I) = s \u2212 N + 1 by [BH1, Lemma 2.4.2], so we have the equality\n\u03b1(I (N r) )/(rN ) = \u03b3(I) = s/N = (\u03b1(I) + N \u2212 1)/N , as claimed. Since as pointed out above\n(r)\n\n\u22121\n\u03b1(I (r) )/r \u2265 \u03b3(I) holds for all r, we also have \u03b1(Ir ) \u2265 \u03b1(I)+N\n.\nN\nSince \u03b1(I) = reg(I), we see I is generated in degree \u03b1(I) = s \u2212 (N \u2212 1) and since \u03b1(I (mrN ) ) =\nmrs \u2265 mr(s \u2212 (N \u2212 1)) + mr(N \u2212 1), it follows by Proposition 2.3 that I (N r) \u2286 M r(N \u22121) I r .\n(m)\n\nfrom above, so (\u2217 ) will be an equality\nNow assume N = 2. Then we have \u03b1(Im ) \u2265 \u03b1(I)+1\n2\nif we verify that \u03b2(I (m) ) = m\u03b1(I). \u0001Note that each of the s lines defining the star configuration\ncontain exactly s \u2212 1 of the n = 2s points pi . Let L be the linear form defining one of these\nlines. If F \u2208 (I (k) )t is a form of degree t < k(s \u2212 1), then L divides F by B\u00e9zout's Theorem.\nThus k(s \u2212 1) \u2264 \u03b2(I (k) ), but \u03b2(I (k) ) \u2264 reg(I (k) ), and, by [GGP, Theorem 1.1], reg(I (k) ) \u2264 kreg(I).\nSince reg(I) = s \u2212 1, we see \u03b2(I (k) ) = k(s \u2212 1) = k\u03b1(I), as we wanted to show. Moreover,\n\u0003\n\u03b1(I (m) )\u03b2(I (m) ) = (sm/2)m(s \u2212 1) = m2 n, so (I (m) )k = I (mk) holds by Proposition 3.5.\nOf course, star\n\u0001 configurations are very special sets of points, but if one takes the ideal J of a\ngeneral set of 2s points of P2 , then \u03b1(J) = reg(J) so J is generated in degree \u03b1(J) and Conjecture\n2.1 holds for I = J (m) by Proposition 3.3. More generally, we now show that Conjecture 2.1 holds\nfor the radical ideal I of any set of n general points of P2 .\nProposition 3.10. Let I = \u2229i I(pi ) \u2282 R for n general points pi \u2208 P2 . Then I (2r) \u2286 M r I r holds\nfor all r.\n\nProof. For n = 1, 3, 6, n is a binomial coefficient, so I (2r) \u2286 M r I r holds as we observed immediately\nabove. For n = 2, 4, the points are a complete intersection, and so I (2r) = I 2r \u2286 M r I r holds. By\nProposition 2.3 it is enough to show that I is generated in degrees s and less for some s such that\n\u03b1(I (2r) )/(2r) \u2265 (s + 1)/2 for all r. Thus it is enough to show that \u03b3(I) \u2265 (s + 1)/2.\nConsider the case n = 5. By [BH2, Lemma 3.1], \u03b1(I (2r) ) = 4r and hence \u03b3(I) = 2. Since the 5\npoints impose independent conditions on forms of degree s for any s \u2265 2, we see reg(I) = 3 (so I\nis generated in degree s = 3 and less). Thus \u03b3(I) = 2 \u2265 (s + 1)/2 as we wanted to show.\n\n\fARE SYMBOLIC POWERS HIGHLY EVOLVED?\n\n7\n\nFor n = 7, I is generated in degrees 3 and less [Ha1] and \u03b3(I) = 21/8 (see the proof of [BH2,\nProposition 4.3]); for n = 8, 9, I is generated in degrees 4 and less since reg(I) = 4, \u03b3(I) = 48/17\n(see the proof of [BH2, Proposition 4.4]) when n = 8 and (it is easy to see) \u03b3(I) = 3 when n \u0001= 9.\nThus I (2r) \u2286 M r I r holds for 7 \u2264 n \u2264 9. Now say n > 9. If n is a binomial coefficient 2s we\n\u0001\n\u0001\nsaw above that I (2r) \u2286 M r I r holds, so assume that 2s < n < s+1\nfor some s \u2265 5. It is known\n2\n\u221a\nthat \u03b3(I) \u2265 n \u2212 1 (see [PSC, Remark 8.3.5] and the proof of [BH1, Theorem\n\u221a 4.2]) and that I is\ngenerated in degree at most s (since reg(I)\n=\ns).\nSo\nwe\nwant\nto\ncheck\nthat\nn \u2212 1 \u2265 (s + 1)/2, or\n\u0001\n\u0001\nthat n \u2212 1 \u2265 (s + 1)2 /4, but n \u2212 1 \u2265 2s and 2s > (s + 1)2 /4 for s \u2265 5.\n\u0003\nFor later use we have the following results regarding the ideal of 5 general points of P2 .\n\nLemma 3.11. Let I be the ideal of 5 general points of P2 . Then I (2r) = (I (2) )r and I (2r+1) = I (2r) I\nfor all r \u2265 1.\n\nProof. We saw in the proof of Proposition 3.10 that \u03b1(I (m) ) = 2m. Also, by B\u00e9zout's Theorem we must have 2\u03b2(I (m) ) \u2265 5m, and by [Ha2, Remark I.5.5] (or by [Ha3, Theorem III.1(a)]),\n(I (m) )t has no non-constant common factors for 2t \u2265 5m. Thus \u03b2(I (m) ) = \u2308 5m\n2 \u2309. In particular,\n\u03b1(I (2r) )\u03b2(I (2r) ) = 5(2r)2 , so I (2r) = (I (2) )r by Proposition 3.5.\nNow consider I (2r+1) . Clearly, I (2r) I = I 2r I = I 2r+1 \u2286 I (2r+1) , so consider the reverse inclusion.\nBy B\u00e9zout's Theorem, since \u03b2(I (2) ) = 5, we have 5\u03b1(I (2r+1) ) \u2265 2\u22175(2r +1), and hence \u03b1(I (2r+1) ) \u2265\n2(2r + 1), but \u03b1(I (2r+1) ) \u2264 \u03b1(I 2r+1 ) = 2(2r + 1), so we have \u03b1(I (2r+1) ) = 2(2r + 1). Thus\n0 = (I (2r+1) )t \u2286 (I (2r) I)t for t < 2(2r + 1). If 2(2r + 1) \u2264 t < 5(2r + 1)/2, then Q is a common\nfactor for (I (2r+1) )t , by B\u00e9zout's Theorem, where Q is a homogeneous form of degree 2 defining\nthe unique conic through the five general points. Thus (I (2r+1) )t = Q(I (2r) )t\u22122 , but Q \u2208 I2 , so\n(I (2r+1) )t \u2286 (I (2r) )t\u22122 I2 \u2286 ((I (2r) )I)t . Finally, assume t \u2265 5(2r + 1)/2 = 5r + 3. Then (I (2r+1) )t =\n\u0003\n(I (2r) )5r I3+(t\u22125r) \u2286 ((I (2r) )I)t by [BH2, Proposition 2.4], and hence I (2r+1) \u2286 I (2r) I.\nRemark 3.12. We close this section with a discussion of issues raised by Proposition 3.5. For\nexample, the bound in Proposition 3.5(ii) improves on Chudnovsky's bound in Proposition 3.1 only\nwhen m\u03b1(I) > \u03b2(I (m) ), but it certainly can happen that m\u03b1(I) < \u03b2(I (m) ). For example, consider\nthe ideal I of n > d2 points on a smooth plane curve of degree d. Then (by B\u00e9zout's Theorem) we\nhave both \u03b1(I) = d and \u03b2(I (m) )d \u2265 nm, so \u03b2(I (m) ) \u2265 nm/d > \u03b1(I)m. There also are cases with\nm\u03b1(I) > \u03b2(I (m) ). For example,\ngiven m\n> 0, let a = (2m + 1)2 \u2212 1 and let n = 2(2m + 1). It is\n\u0001\n\u0001\na+1\nm+1\neasy now to check that 2 = n2 2 . Let I be the ideal of the union Z of n2 general points in\nP2 . By [CM, E, R], the fat point scheme iZ imposes independent conditions on forms of degree t\n\u221a\n\u0001\n2 , so m\u03b1(I) > m( 2n \u2212 2).\nfor any t such that (I (i) )t 6= 0. In particular, it follows that \u03b1(I)+2\n>\nn\n2\n\u0001\n\u0001\nSince a+1\n= n2 m+1\n, it also follows that \u03b2(I (m) ) \u2264 reg(I (m) ) = a = (2m + 1)2 \u2212 1, hence for\n2\n2\n\u221a\n\u221a\nm \u226b 0 we have \u03b2(I (m) ) < (2m + 1)2 < 4 2m2 < m( 2n \u2212 2) < m\u03b1(I).\nAnother issue raised by Proposition 3.5 is whether there are cases of n points in the plane and\nintegers m > 0 where the ideal I of the points satisfies \u03b1(I (m) )\u03b2(I (m) ) = m2 n. This holds for the\nideal I of a star configuration by Corollary 3.9, hence I (2k) = (I (2) )k for all k \u2265 1. For additional\nexamples, consider the scheme Z consisting of n general points of the plane. For n \u2264 8 points, we\ncan assume the points lie on a smooth cubic curve, in which case the results of [Ha3, GuH, GHM]\ncan be used to determine \u03b1(I (m) ) and \u03b2(I (m) ). For n = 1, \u03b1(I (m) ) = \u03b2(I (m) ) = m for all m \u2265 1,\nhence by Proposition 3.5 we have I (k) = I k for all k \u2265 1. Of course, in this case Z is a complete\nintersection. For n = 2, \u03b1(I (m) ) = m and \u03b2(I (m) ) = 2m for all m \u2265 1, hence we have I (k) = I k for\nall k \u2265 1. Of course, in this case Z is again a complete intersection. For n = 3, \u03b1(I (m) ) = \u23083m/2\u2309\nand \u03b2(I (m) ) = 2m for all m \u2265 1, hence we have I (2k) = (I (2) )k for all k \u2265 1. In this case Z is a\nstar configuration. For n = 4, \u03b1(I (m) ) = \u03b2(I (m) ) = 2m for all m \u2265 1, hence we have I (k) = I k\nfor all k \u2265 1. Of course, in this case Z is yet again a complete intersection. For n = 5, we\n\n\f8\n\nBRIAN HARBOURNE & CRAIG HUNEKE\n\nhave I (2k) = (I (2) )k for all k \u2265 1; see Lemma 3.11 and its proof. For n = 6, \u03b1(I (m) ) = \u230812m/5\u2309\nand \u03b2(I (m) ) = \u23085m/2\u2309 for all m \u2265 1, hence we have I (10k) = (I (10) )k for all k \u2265 1. For n = 7,\n\u03b1(I (m) ) = \u230821m/8\u2309 and \u03b2(I (m) ) = \u23088m/3\u2309 for all m \u2265 1, hence we have I (24k) = (I (24) )k for all\nk \u2265 1. For n = 8, \u03b1(I (m) ) = \u230848m/17\u2309 and \u03b2(I (m) ) = \u230817m/6\u2309 for all m \u2265 1, hence we have\nI (102k) = (I (102) )k for all k \u2265 1.\nAgain applying the results of [Ha3], for n = 9 general points (which we may assume therefore\nlie on a smooth cubic curve), we have \u03b1(I (m) ) = 3m and \u03b2(I (m) ) = 3m + 1, so we never have\n\u03b1(I (m) )\u03b2(I (m) ) = m2 n, but if the 9 points pi are chosen to be points on a smooth plane cubic curve\nsuch that p1 + * * * + p9 \u2212 p has order r in the divisor class group of the cubic (where p is a flex\npoint), then \u03b1(I (m) ) = 3m and \u03b2(I (m) ) is 3m if r|m, and 3m + 1 if r does not divide m. Thus\n\u03b1(I (r) )\u03b2(I (r) ) = 9r 2 , so I (rk) = (I (r) )k for all k \u2265 0.\nRemark 3.13. Finally, we raise two questions. Given distinct points pi in the plane and positive\nintegers mi , consider the ideal I = \u2229i I(pi )mi . Is it true that I (mk) = (I (m) )k for k \u2265 1 (and hence\nP\nthat the symbolic Rees algebra \u2295I (n) is Noetherian) if \u03b1(I (m) )\u03b2(I (m) ) = m2 i m2i ? See [BH2,\nP\nExample 5.1] for examples with \u03b1(I)\u03b2(I) = i m2i for which I (k) = I k for all k \u2265 1. Conversely, if\nP\n\u2295I (n) is Noetherian, must \u03b1(I (m) )\u03b2(I (m) ) = m2 i m2i hold for some m?\n4. Additional questions and conjectures\n\nIf for some ideal I there is a d such that one has I (m) \u2286 I r for all m \u2265 dr, one can next ask\nfor what constants c does m \u2265 dr \u2212 c guarantee I (m) \u2286 I r . We discuss questions and conjectures\nrelated to this problem of subtracting a constant in Section 4.1. In Section 4.2 we discuss questions\nand conjectures arising out of refinements of the Waldschmidt-Skoda bound (\u25e6 ) of the Introduction.\n4.1. Subtracting a constant. The second named author has raised the question whether a radical\nideal I of a finite set of points in P2 always satisfies I (3) \u2286 I 2 . Examples suggested to the first\nnamed author the following conjectural generalization [PSC, Conjecture 8.4.2]:\nConjecture 4.1.1. Let I \u2286 K[PN ] be a homogeneous ideal. Then I (rN \u2212(N \u22121)) \u2286 I r holds for all\nr.\nConjecture 4.1.1 holds for star configurations [PSC, Example 8.4.8]; examples of star configurations also show I (rN \u2212N ) \u2286 I r fails in general. When N = 2, Conjecture 4.1.1 is true for any finite\nset of general points in P2 by [BH1, Remark 4.3]. Thus, while Conjecture 4.1.1 is open in general,\nit is plausible (at least for ideals of points). In fact, the second named author observed that the\nprinciple underlying the main result of [HH1] shows that Conjecture 4.1.1 is true for radical ideals\nof any finite set of points if char(K) = p > 0 when r is a power of p [PSC, Remark 8.4.4]. The\nsame basic argument also verifies Conjecture 4.1.1 for monomial ideals (with no restriction on the\ncharacteristic) [PSC, Remark 8.4.5].\nThe key in both cases is the use of nice behavior of Frobenius powers. If I \u2286 R is an ideal,\ndefine its qth Frobenius power I [q] to be the ideal generated by all v q for v \u2208 I. If I is a monomial\nideal, then I [q] is generated by the qth powers of any set of monomial generators of I. And if\nchar(K) = p > 0 and q is a power of p, then I [q] is generated by qth powers of any set of generators\n[q]\nof I. A fundamental fact for ideals J1 , . . . , Js \u2286 R is that (\u2229i Ji )[q] = \u2229i (Ji ) if either Ji is monomial\nfor each i (see [PSC, Remark 8.4.5]) or if p = char(K) > 0 and q is a power of p (by flatness of\nFrobenius; see [SH, Lemma 13.1.3, p. 247] and [K]). As a direct consequence we obtain:\nLemma 4.1.2. Let g > 0 be an integer and let J1 , . . . , Js \u2286 R be ideals, each generated by at most\ng elements. Assume either that each Ji is monomial, or that p = char(K) > 0 and r is a power of\np. Then \u2229i (Jim ) \u2286 (\u2229i Ji )r as long as m \u2265 gr \u2212 g + 1.\n\n\fARE SYMBOLIC POWERS HIGHLY EVOLVED?\n\n9\n\nProof. Because Ji has at most g generators, any product of a choice of gr \u2212 g + 1 of these generators\n[r]\nis divisible by the rth power of one of the generators. Thus Jim \u2286 Jigr\u2212g+1 \u2286 Ji , so we have\n[r]\n\u2229i (Jim ) \u2286 \u2229i (Ji ) = (\u2229i Ji )[r] \u2286 (\u2229i Ji )r .\n\u0003\nRemark 4.1.3. We now see that Conjecture 4.1.1 holds for any monomial ideal I \u2282 K[PN ]. If\nI is not saturated, then I (rN \u2212(N \u22121)) = I rN \u2212(N \u22121) \u2286 I r , and if I is saturated then there is a\n(not necessarily irredundant) primary decomposition I = \u2229i Ji where each Ji is monomial, primary\nand generated by positive powers of the variables in some proper subset (depending on i) of the\nN + 1 variables (and hence Ji has at most N generators). Moreover, it is not hard to show that\nI (m) \u2286 \u2229i (Jim ) (see [PSC, Remark 8.4.5]). Lemma 4.1.2 now applies, and we have I (m) \u2286 I r\nwhenever m \u2265 rN \u2212 N + 1. Similarly, if p = char(K) > 0 and r is a power of p, then for\nthe ideal I = \u2229i I(pi ) of any finite set of distinct points pi \u2208 PN , by Lemma 4.1.2 we have\nI (m) = \u2229i (I(pi )m ) \u2286 (\u2229i I(pi ))r = I r as long as m \u2265 rN \u2212 N + 1.\nWhen N = 2 Chudnovsky's bound \u03b3(I) \u2265 (\u03b1(I) + 1)/2 suggests another conjecture (in the\nperhaps weak sense that Conjecture 4.1.4 implies the bound):\nConjecture 4.1.4. Let I \u2286 K[P2 ] be the homogeneous radical ideal of a finite set of points. Then\nI (m) \u2286 I r holds whenever m/r \u2265 2\u03b1(I)/(\u03b1(I) + 1).\nThis conjecture does indeed imply Chudnovsky's bound \u03b3(I) \u2265 (\u03b1(I) + 1)/2. To see this, let\nm = 2\u03b1(I)t and let r = (\u03b1(I) + 1)t for integers t \u2265 1. Conjecture 4.1.4 then implies that I (m) \u2286 I r\nwhich in turn implies \u03b1(I (m) ) \u2265 \u03b1(I r ) and hence \u03b1(I (m) )/m \u2265 (r/m)\u03b1(I). Taking limits as t \u2192 \u221e\ngives \u03b3(I) \u2265 (\u03b1(I) + 1)/2.\nConjecture 4.1.4 is asymptotically stronger than Conjecture 4.1.1 since 2r\u22121 > 2r\u03b1(I)/(\u03b1(I)+1)\nfor r \u226b 0. But as with Conjecture 4.1.1, Conjecture 4.1.4 holds for star configurations: if I is the\nideal of a star configuration, then \u03b1(I) = reg(I) and \u03b3(I) = (\u03b1(I) + 1)/2, hence we have I (m) \u2286 I r\nby [BH1, Theorem 1.2.1(b)] (since m/r \u2265 2\u03b1(I)/(\u03b1(I) + 1) = reg(I)/\u03b3(I)).\nIt is easy to see that Conjecture 4.1.4 holds if I is a complete intersection, since then I (m) = I m .\nConjecture 4.1.4 also holds for general sets of n points (use [BH1, Remark 4.3] in case n \u2265 6, since\nthen \u03b1(I) \u2265 3 and so 2\u03b1(I)/(\u03b1(I) + 1) \u2265 3/2, use [BH2, Theorem 3.4(b)] for n = 5, and for n < 5\nnote that n general points give either a star or a complete intersection or both).\nGiving Conjecture 4.1.1 an evolutionary twist, we obtain another possibility:\nConjecture 4.1.5. Let I \u2286 K[PN ] be the ideal of a finite set of points pi \u2208 PN . Then I (rN \u2212(N \u22121)) \u2286\nM (r\u22121)(N \u22121) I r holds for all r \u2265 1.\nLemma 4.1.6. Let I \u2286 K[PN ] be the ideal of a finite set of points pi \u2208 PN . If I (N r\u2212(N \u22121)) \u2286 I r\nand \u03b1(I (N r\u2212(N \u22121)) ) \u2265 rs + (r \u2212 1)(N \u2212 1) for some s such that I is generated in degrees s and less,\nthen I (rN \u2212(N \u22121)) \u2286 M (r\u22121)(N \u22121) I r .\nProof. The same argument (with m = 1) used in the proof of Proposition 2.3 works here.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 4.1.7. Let I \u2286 K[PN ] be the ideal of a finite set of points pi \u2208 PN , comprising either\na star configuration or a complete intersection. Then I (rN \u2212(N \u22121)) \u2286 M (r\u22121)(N \u22121) I r holds for all\nr \u2265 1.\nProof. Since for star configurations \u03b1(I (N r\u2212(N \u22121)) ) = rreg(I) + (r \u2212 1)(N \u2212 1) by [PSC, Lemma\n8.4.7], Lemma 4.1.6 applies with s = reg(I) both conditions of Lemma 4.1.6, so the result follows.\nFor complete intersections we have I (rN \u2212(N \u22121)) = I rN \u2212(N \u22121) = I rN \u2212r\u2212(N \u22121) I r = I (r\u22121)(N \u22121) I r \u2286\nM (r\u22121)(N \u22121) I r .\n\u0003\nOf course, if Conjecture 4.1.5 is true, then so must be the following:\n\n\f10\n\nBRIAN HARBOURNE & CRAIG HUNEKE\n\nConjecture 4.1.8. Let I \u2286 K[PN ] be the ideal of a finite set of points pi \u2208 PN . Then\nfor every r > 0.\n\n\u03b1(I (rN \u2212(N \u22121)) ) \u2265 r\u03b1(I) + (r \u2212 1)(N \u2212 1)\n\nRemark 4.1.9. Conjecture 4.1.8 is clearly true if \u03b1(I) = 1 or if r = 1. It also holds if \u03b3(I) \u2265\n(r\u03b1(I) + (r \u2212 1)(N \u2212 1))/(rN \u2212 (N \u2212 1)), since \u03b1(I (rN \u2212(N \u22121)) )/(rN \u2212 (N \u2212 1)) \u2265 \u03b3(I). But if\n\u03b1(I) > 1, then (r\u03b1(I) + (r \u2212 1)(N \u2212 1))/(rN \u2212 (N \u2212 1)) is biggest when r is least, so Conjecture\n4.1.8 will hold for all r if \u03b3(I) \u2265 (r\u03b1(I) + (r \u2212 1)(N \u2212 1))/(rN \u2212 (N \u2212 1)) holds for r = 2.\nRemark 4.1.10. As mentioned in Remark 3.4, if I is the radical ideal of a finite set of points\npi \u2208 PN , Chudnovsky conjectured that \u03b3(I) \u2265 (\u03b1(I) + N \u2212 1)/N . It seems plausible in fact that\n\u03b3(I) > (\u03b1(I)+N \u22121)/N unless either the points lie on a hyperplane or give a star configuration. This\nis however open, even for N = 2. The best current result is: if N = 2 and if \u03b1(I (2) )/2 = (\u03b1(I)+1)/2,\nthen the points pi either lie on a line or give a star configuration [BC]. If it were true that\n\u03b3(I) > (\u03b1(I) + N \u2212 1)/N unless either the points were contained in a hyperplane or formed a star\nconfiguration, then Conjecture 4.1.8 would at least hold for all r \u226b 0, as the next result shows.\nCorollary 4.1.11. For the radical ideal I of a finite set of points p1 , . . . , pn \u2208 PN we have\n\u03b1(I (N r\u2212N +1) ) \u2265 r\u03b1(I) + (r \u2212 1)(N \u2212 1)\n\nfor all r \u226b 0 if either \u03b1(I) = 1 or the points pi form a star configuration or \u03b3(I) > (\u03b1(I)+N \u22121)/N .\n\nProof. If \u03b1(I) = 1, then \u03b1(I (rN \u2212(N \u22121)) ) = rN \u2212 (N \u2212 1) = r\u03b1(I) + (r \u2212 1)(N \u2212 1). By [PSC,\nLemma 8.4.7 ], if the points form a star configuration on s lines, then \u03b1(I) = s \u2212 N + 1 and\n\u03b1(I (rN \u2212(N \u22121)) ) = (r \u2212 1)s + s \u2212 N + 1 = r\u03b1(I) + (r \u2212 1)(N \u2212 1). If \u03b3(I) > (\u03b1(I) + N \u2212 1)/N ,\nthen \u03b3(I) = \u03b4 + (g + N \u2212 1)/N for some \u03b4 > 0 where g = \u03b1(I). Hence for r \u226b 0 we have\n\u03b1(I (N r\u2212(N \u22121)) ) \u2265 rg + (r \u2212 1)(N \u2212 1), since \u03b1(I (N r\u2212(N \u22121)) ) \u2265 (N r \u2212 (N \u2212 1))\u03b3(I) = (N r \u2212 (N \u2212\n1))\u03b4 + (N r \u2212 (N \u2212 1))(g + N \u2212 1)/N = rg + (r \u2212 1)(N \u2212 1) + (N (N r \u2212 (N \u2212 1))\u03b4 \u2212 (g \u2212 1)(N \u2212 1))/N\nand the last term is positive for r \u226b 0.\n\u0003\n\nExample 4.1.12. We now check that Conjecture 4.1.8 holds for every set of n \u2264 8 points of P2 .\nBy Remark 4.1.9, it is enough to check \u03b3(I) \u2265 (2\u03b1(I) + 1)/3. When N = 2, \u03b3(I) can be found for\neach set of n \u2264 8 points of P2 using the results of [GuH, GHM]\n(see http://www.math.unl.edu/~bharbourne1/GammaFile.html). It turns out that\n\u03b3(I) \u2265 (2\u03b1(I) + 1)/3 holds for every configuration of n \u2264 8 points except for four cases: the 3\npoints coming from the star for 3 lines; the 6 points coming from the star for 4 lines; 6 points where\n3 of them are a star for 3 lines and an additional point is chosen on each of those 3 lines but such\nthat these three additional points are not collinear; and 7 points where 6 of them form the star on\n4 lines and an additional point is placed on one of those 4 lines. In each of these cases except for\nthe star configuration of 6 points, \u03b3(I) \u2265 (r\u03b1(I) + r \u2212 1)/(2r \u2212 1) holds for r = 3 (and hence by\nRemark 4.1.9 for r \u2265 3) and \u03b1(I (2r\u22121) ) \u2265 (r\u03b1(I) + r \u2212 1)/(2r \u2212 1) holds for r = 2. This leaves the\n6 point star configuration, but Corollary 4.1.11 shows that Conjecture 4.1.8 holds for stars.\nNow we show Conjecture 4.1.5 holds in the case of n general points when N = 2. (We use\nthe characteristic 0 hypothesis only for some values of r and n where we apply [D]; see the last\nparagraph of the proof.)\nCorollary 4.1.13. Let I be the ideal of n general points of P2 ; assume the ground field K has\nchar(K) = 0. Then I (2r\u22121) I \u2286 M r\u22121 I r .\n\nProof. As noted in Corollary 4.1.7, I (2r\u22121) I \u2286 M r\u22121 I r holds for complete intersections and for star\nconfigurations. Thus it holds for n = 1, 2, 4 since in these cases we have a complete intersection,\nand it holds for n = 3 since this is a star configuration. It holds for n = 5 by Proposition 3.10\n\n\fARE SYMBOLIC POWERS HIGHLY EVOLVED?\n\n11\n\nand Lemma 3.11, since I (2r\u22121) = I (2(r\u22121)) I \u2286 M r\u22121 I r\u22121 I = M r\u22121 I r . For larger n, note that\nI (2r\u22121) \u2286 I r holds for general points by [PSC, Example 8.4.9], so I (2r\u22121) I \u2286 M r\u22121 I r also holds (by\nLemma 4.1.6) if \u03b3(I) \u2265 (rreg(I) + r \u2212 1)/(2r \u2212 1). Therefore I (2r\u22121) I \u2286 M r\u22121 I r holds for n = 6\nsince then \u03b1(I) = reg(I) and in Example 4.1.12 we verified that \u03b3(I) \u2265 (r\u03b1(I) + r \u2212 1)/(2r \u2212 1)\nholds for r \u2265 2 for every configuration of 3 6= n \u2264 8 general points. Similarly, I (2r\u22121) I \u2286 M r\u22121 I r\nholds for n = 7 since (as noted in the proof of Proposition 3.10) I is generated in degree \u03b1(I); now\nargue as in the case n = 6. For n = 8, reg(I) = 4 and (as in the proof of Proposition 3.10) we have\n\u03b3(I) = 48/17 \u2265 (rreg(I) + r \u2212 1)/(2r \u2212 1) for r = 3 (and hence for all r \u2265 3), while for r = 2, we\nhave \u03b1(I (2r\u22121) ) = 9 = rreg(I) + r \u2212 1, so I (2r\u22121) I \u2286 M r\u22121 I r holds for n = 8. And for n = 9 general\n(2r\u22121) I \u2286 M r\u22121 I r holds.\npoints of P2 , \u03b3(I) = 3 = (rreg(I) + r \u2212 1)/(2r \u2212 1) for r = 2, so again\n\u0001\n\u221a I\nfor some\nNow let n \u2265 10; as in the proof of Proposition 3.10, \u03b3(I) \u2265 n \u2212 1.

So now assume 2 < n < 2 for some s \u2265 5. Then reg(I) = s, \u0001so we\n\u221a\nwant\nto\ncheck\nthat\nn \u2212 1 \u2265 (2s + 1)/3, or that n \u2212 1 \u2265 (2s + 1)2 /9, but n \u2212 1 \u2265 2s and\n\u0001\ns\n(2s + 1)2 /9 for s \u2265 18. So we need to check s \u2264 17; i.e., 10 < n < 153. By direct check we\n2 \u2265\u221a\nhave n \u2212 1 \u2265 (rreg(I) + r \u2212 1)/(2r \u2212 1) for r = 7 for 10 < n < 153. So now we just need to check\nthat \u03b1(I (2r\u22121) ) \u2265 r\u03b1(I) + (r \u2212 1) holds for 2 \u2264 r \u2264 6 for 10 < n < 153. We verified this using [D]\n\u0003\nto determine \u03b1(I (2r\u22121) ); note that [D] assumes characteristic 0.\nRemark 4.1.14. It may be worthwhile to consider the maximum height of the associated primes.\nIf e is the maximum of the heights of the associated primes of a given homogeneous ideal I, then\nfrom [HH1] we know I (re) \u2286 I r , and it is conjectured in [PSC] that I (re\u2212(e\u22121)) \u2286 I r . This raises\nthe question of whether I (re) \u2286 M r(e\u22121) I r and I (re\u2212(e\u22121)) \u2286 M (r\u22121)(e\u22121) I r are also true.\n\nRemark 4.1.15. As a minor remark, we show how classical methods can be used to show I (2m) \u2286\nI m in some cases of ideals of points p1 , . . . , pn \u2208 P2 . Assume I is a radical ideal for a finite set of\npoints in P2 . Assume the characteristic is 0, and that \u03b1(I) = reg(I). Using the Euler identity as\nin the proof of Fact 1.2, we have I (2m) \u2286 M m I (m) . But \u03b1(I) = reg(I) implies that I m = M j \u2229 I (m)\nfor j = m\u03b1(I) = \u03b1(I m ), since the saturation degree of I m is bounded above by mreg(I) which by\nour hypothesis is equal to \u03b1(I m ), so truncating I (m) at degree \u03b1(I m ) gives I m (see [BH2, Remark\n4.2]).\nSince M m I (m) \u2286 I (m) , we now see that M m I (m) \u2286 M j \u2229 I (m) = I m if M m I (m) \u2286 M j ; i.e.,\nif \u03b1(M m I (m) ) \u2265 j. But \u03b1(M m I (m) ) = \u03b1(I (m) ) + m \u2265 m\u03b3(I) + m so \u03b1(M m I (m) ) \u2265 j holds if\nm\u03b3(I) + m \u2265 j = m\u03b1(I); i.e., if \u03b3(I) \u2265 \u03b1(I) \u2212 1. This holds if (\u03b1(I) + 1)/2 \u2265 \u03b1(I) \u2212 1 (i.e., if\n\u03b1(I) \u2264 3) since \u03b3(I) \u2265 (\u03b1(I) + 1)/2.\nThis shows that I (2m) \u2286 I m holds in characteristic 0 if \u03b1(I) = reg(I) and 3 \u2265 \u03b1(I). We note\nthat \u03b1(I) = reg(I) implies that n is a binomial coefficient, so we have either n = 6 and p1 , . . . , p6\nlie on a cubic but not on a conic (there are five essentially different such configurations [GuH]), or\nn = 3 and p1 , p2 , p3 lie on a conic but not on a line, or n = 1.\nAdditional cases follow from \u03b3(I) \u2265 \u03b1(I) \u2212 1. For example, for any 10 points which do not lie on\na cubic, we have \u03b1(I) = reg(I). If some 9 of the points lie on a smooth cubic, then 3\u03b1(I (m) ) \u2265 9m\nholds by B\u00e9zout's Theorem, so we have \u03b3(I) \u2265 3 = \u03b1(I) \u2212 1 and thus I (2m) \u2286 I m .\n\n4.2. Further refinements. A refinement of (\u25e6 ) of the Introduction is given in [W2, Lemme 7.5.2].\nIn our terms, this refinement is that\n\n\u03b1(I (m) )\n\u2264 \u03b3(I).\n(\u2217\u2217 )\nm+N \u22121\nfor the radical ideal I for a finite set of points in the complex projective space PN . The proof\ngiven in [W2] uses complex analytic techniques; for an easy proof using multiplier ideals, see [La,\nProposition 10.1.1 and Example 10.1.3].\n\n\f12\n\nBRIAN HARBOURNE & CRAIG HUNEKE\n\nIn fact, by a variation of the proof given in the introduction for the case m = 1, (\u2217\u2217 ) holds for any\nhomogeneous ideal 0 6= I \u2286 K[PN ] over any field K. In particular, we have I (t(m+N \u22121)) \u2286 (I (m) )t\nfor m \u2265 1 by [HH2], so t\u03b1(I (m) ) \u2264 \u03b1(I (t(m+N \u22121)) ). Dividing by t(m + N \u2212 1) and taking limits as\nt \u2192 \u221e gives (\u2217\u2217 ).\nAgain let I be the radical ideal I for a finite set of points in the projective space PN but over\nthe complex numbers. A further refinement, proved using complex projective techniques, is given\nin [EV] for the case that N \u2265 2:\n\u03b1(I (m) ) + 1\n\u2264 \u03b3(I).\n(\u2217\u2217\u2217 )\nm+N \u22121\nThis is just Proposition 3.1 when m = 1 and N = 2. Comparing (\u2217\u2217\u2217 ) with Chudnovsky's conjecture\n(\u03b1(I) + N \u2212 1)/N \u2264 \u03b3(I) raises the question:\nQuestion 4.2.1. Let I be the radical ideal I for a finite set of points in PN . Is it true for all\nm \u2265 1 that\n\u03b1(I (m) ) + N \u2212 1\n\u2264 \u03b3(I)?\nm+N \u22121\n\nUsing the fact that for the ideal I of a star configuration defined by s hyperplanes in PN with\nm = N i + j for 0 \u2264 i and 0 < i \u2264 N we have \u03b1(I (m) ) = (i + 1)s \u2212 N + j, one can check that\nQuestion 4.2.1 has an affirmative answer for star configurations.\nThese speculations and observations raise two additional questions for the radical ideal I of a\nfinite set of points in PN :\nQuestion 4.2.2. Is it true for all positive integers m and t that I (t(m+N \u22121)) \u2286 M t (I (m) )t , where\nM \u2282 K[PN ] is the ideal generated by the variables?\nIf Question 4.2.2 has an affirmative answer, then we obtain an alternate proof of (\u2217\u2217\u2217 ) in the\nusual way.\nFinally we ask:\nQuestion 4.2.3. Is it true for all positive integers m and t that I (t(m+N \u22121)) \u2286 M t(N \u22121) (I (m) )t ?\nIf so, then Question 4.2.1 must also have an affirmative answer.\nReferences\n[BC]\n[BH1]\n[BH2]\n[B]\n[Ch]\n\n[CM]\n[D]\n[ELS]\n[EM]\n[EV]\n\nC.
