Field and Killing-spinor equations\nThe bosonic fields of the ten-dimensional supergravity which arises as low energy effective theory of the\nheterotic string are the spacetime metric g, the NS three-form field strength H, the dilaton \u03c6 and the gauge\nconnection A with curvature F A . The bosonic geometry is of the form R1,9\u2212d \u00d7 M d where the bosonic\nfields are non-trivial only on M d , d \u2264 8. We consider the two connections\n1\n\u2207\u00b1 = \u2207g \u00b1 H,\n2\nwhere \u2207g is the Levi-Civita connection of the Riemannian metric g. Both connections preserve the metric,\n\u2207\u00b1 g = 0 and have totally skew-symmetric torsion \u00b1H, respectively.\nThe Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism requires that the three-form Bianchi identity receive an \u03b1\u2032 correction of the form\n\u0011\n\u03b1\u2032 \u0010\n\u03b1\u2032\nT r(R \u2227 R) \u2212 T r(F A \u2227 F A ) ,\n(1.1)\ndH = 8\u03c0 2 (p1 (M p ) \u2212 p1 (E)) =\n4\n4\nDate: November 2, 2018.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMARISA FERN\u00c1NDEZ, STEFAN IVANOV, LUIS UGARTE, AND RAQUEL VILLACAMPA\n\nwhere p1 (M p ), p1 (E) are the first Pontrjagin forms of M p with respect to a connection \u2207 with curvature\nR and the vector bundle E with connection A, respectively.\nA class of heterotic-string backgrounds for which the Bianchi identity of the three-form H receives a\ncorrection of type (1.1) are those with (2,0) world-volume supersymmetry. Such models were considered in\n[31]. The target-space geometry of (2,0)-supersymmetric sigma models has been extensively investigated\nin [31, 39, 28]. Recently, there is revived interest in these models [21, 9, 22, 23, 24] as string backgrounds\nand in connection to heterotic-string compactifications with fluxes [8, 2, 3, 4, 36, 19, 20, 5].\nIn writing (1.1) there is a subtlety to the choice of connection \u2207 on M p since anomalies can be cancelled\nindependently of the choice [29]. Different connections correspond to different regularization schemes in the\ntwo-dimensional worldsheet non-linear sigma model. Hence the background fields given for the particular\nchoice of \u2207 must be related to those for a different choice by a field redefinition [38]. Connections on M d\nproposed to investigate the anomaly cancellation (1.1) are \u2207g [39, 23], \u2207+ [9] and very recently [14], \u2207\u2212\n[29, 6, 8, 24, 32, 35], Chern connection \u2207c when d = 6 [39, 36, 19, 20, 5].\nA heterotic geometry will preserve supersymmetry if and only if, in 10 dimensions, there exists at least\none Majorana-Weyl spinor \u01eb such that the supersymmetry variations of the fermionic fields vanish, i.e. the\nnext Killing-spinor equations hold [39]\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n\u03b4\u03bb = \u2207m \u01eb = \u2207gm + Hmnp \u0393np \u01eb = \u2207+ \u01eb = 0\n4\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n\u03b4\u03a8 = \u0393m \u2202m \u03c6 \u2212 Hmnp \u0393mnp \u01eb = (d\u03c6 \u2212 H) * \u01eb = 0\n(1.2)\n12\n2\nA\n\u03b4\u03be = Fmn\n\u0393mn \u01eb = F A * \u01eb = 0,\n\nwhere \u03bb, \u03a8, \u03be are the gravitino, the dilatino and the gaugino, fields, respectively and * means Clifford action\nof forms on spinors.\nThe bosonic part of the ten-dimensional supergravity action in the string frame is ([6], R = R\u2212 )\nZ\n\u0011i\nh\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u2032 \u0010\n1\n1\n(1.3)\nT r|F A |2 ) \u2212 T r|R|2 .\nS = 2 d10 x \u2212ge\u22122\u03c6 Scalg + 4(\u2207g \u03c6)2 \u2212 |H|2 \u2212\n2k\n2\n4\n\nThe string frame field equations (the equations of motion induced from the action (1.3)) of the heterotic\nstring up to two-loops [30] in sigma model perturbation theory are (we use the notations in [24])\ni\n1\n\u03b1\u2032 h A\nRicgij \u2212 Himn Hjmn + 2\u2207gi \u2207gj \u03c6 \u2212\n(F )imab (F A )mab\n\u2212 Rimnq Rjmnq = 0;\nj\n4\n4\ni\n(1.4)\n\u2207gi (e\u22122\u03c6 Hjk\n) = 0;\n\u22122\u03c6\n\u2207+\n(F A )ij ) = 0.\ni (e\n\nThe field equation of the dilaton \u03c6 is implied from the first two equations above.\nThe first compact torsional solutions for the heterotic/type I string were obtained via duality from Mtheory compactifications on K3 \u00d7 K3 proposed in [13]. The metric was first written down on the orientifold\nlimit in [13] and such backgrounds have since been studied (see [2, 3] and references therein). The metric\nand the H-flux are derived by applying a chain of supergravity dualities and the resulting geometry in the\nheterotic theory is a T2 bundle over a K3.\nCompact example solving (1.2) and (1.1) with nonzero field strength, constant dilaton and taking R =\nR+ , is constructed in [9] on the Iwasawa nilmanifold which is a T2 bundle over T4 . However, it has been\npointed out in [23] that this example is not a valid solution due to a sign error in the torsional equation\nderived from the first two equations in (1.2) which leads to the opposite sign in the left hand side of (1.1).\nCompact example of a balanced 6-manifold with constant dilaton non-trivial warped factor and torsion\ngenerated by the Chern-Simons term only is presented very recently in [14].\nCompact examples in dimension six solving (1.2) and (1.1) with non-zero flux H and non-constant\ndilaton were constructed by Li and Yau [36] for U(4) and U(5) principal bundles taking R = Rc -the\ncurvature of the Chern connection in (1.1). Non-Kaehler compact solutions of (1.2) and (1.1) on some\ntorus bundles over Calabi-Yau 4-manifold (K3 surfaces or complex torus) provided in [25] are presented by\nFu and Yau [19, 20] using the Chern connection in (1.1). It is confirmed in [5] that the examples of torus\n\n\fHETEROTIC STRING COMPACTIFICATIONS WITH NON-ZERO FLUXES AND CONSTANT DILATON\n\n3\n\nbundles over the complex torus can not be solutions to (1.2) and (1.1) taking with respect to the curvature\nof the Chern connection R = Rc with \u03b1\u2032 > 0 while some torus bundles over K3 surfaces are valid solutions.\nIt is known [15, 22] ([24] for dimension 6) that the equations of motion of type I supergravity are\nautomatically satisfied with R = 0 if one imposes, in addition to the preserving supersymmetry equations\n(1.2), the three-form Bianchi identity (1.1) taking with respect to a flat connection on T M , R = 0.\nAccording to no-go (vanishing) theorems (a consequence of the equations of motion [17, 15]; a consequence of the supersymmetry [34, 33] for SU(n)-case and [23] for the general case) there are no compact\nsolutions with non-zero flux and non-constant dilaton satisfying simultaneously the supersymmetry equations (1.2) and the three-form Bianchi identity (1.1) with T r(R \u2227 R) = 0.\nHowever, in the presence of a curvature term R the solution of the supersymmetry equations (1.2) and\nthe anomaly cancellation condition (1.1) obey the second and the third equations of motion but do not\nalways satisfy the gravitino equation of motion (the first equation in (1.4)). If R is an SU(3)-instanton\nthen (1.2) and (1.1) imply (1.4). This can be seen from the considerations in the Appendix of [22]. We\ngive a quadratic expression for R which is necessary and sufficient condition in order that (1.2) and (1.1)\nimply (1.4) based on the properties of the special geometric structure induced from the first two equations\nin (1.2). More precisely, we prove in Section 2.2 the following\nTheorem 1.1. Let (M, J, g, F A , R) be a conformally balanced Hermitian manifold with Kaehler form F\nwhich solves the heterotic Killing spinor equations (1.2) and the anomaly cancellation (1.1).\na): The gravitino equation of motion is a consequence of the heterotic Killing spinor equations (1.2)\nand the anomaly cancellation (1.1) if and only if the next identity holds\ni\n1h\nRmsab Rpqab + Rmpab Rqsab + Rmqab Rspab F pq Jns = Rmpqr Rnpqr .\n(1.5)\n2\ns p\n\u2022 If R is (1, 1)-form, Jm\nJn Rspab = Rmnab then (1.5) is equivalent to\n(1.6)\n\nRmjab Rklab F kl = 0.\n\nIn particular, the gravitino equation of motion with respect to either the Chern connection\nor the (\u2013)-connection is a consequence of the heterotic Killing spinor equations (1.2) and the\nanomaly cancellation (1.1) if and only if (1.6) holds.\n\u2022 If R is an SU(3)-instanton then (1.5) holds.\nb): If R\u2212 is an SU(3)-instanton, Hol(\u2207+ ) \u2282 su(3) and the manifold is compact then the flux H\nvanishes, the dilaton is constant and the manifold is a Calabi-Yau space.\nAs a consequence of Theorem 1.1, considering solutions involving Chern connection, one may study\nstability of the tangent bundle.\nThe main goal of this paper is to construct explicit compact valid solutions with non-zero field strength,\nnon-flat instanton and constant dilaton to the heterotic equations of motion (1.4) in dimension six. We\npresent compact nilmanifolds in dimension six satisfying the heterotic supersymmetry equations (1.2) with\nnon-zero flux H 6= 0, non-flat instanton F A 6= 0 and constant dilaton obeying the three-form Bianchi\nidentity (1.1) with curvature term R = Rg , R = R+ or R = Rc . Some of them are torus bundles over the\ncomplex torus but this does not violate the non-existence result in [5] since we use different curvature term\n(Rg or R+ ) in (1.1). In particular, we present a valid solution on the Iwasawa manifold but with respect\nto a non-standard complex structure. We find compact valid solutions to (1.2) with non-zero flux, non-flat\ninstanton and constant dilaton satisfying anomaly cancellation condition (1.1) using the curvature Rc of\nthe Chern connection on an S 1 bundle over a 5-manifold which is a T2 bundle over T3 . All manifolds do\nnot admit any Kaehler metric and seem to be the first explicit compact valid supersymmetric heterotic\nsolutions to (1.2) and (1.1) with non-zero flux, non-flat instanton and constant dilaton in dimension six.\nHowever, because of Theorem 1.1, the gravitino equation of motion is not satisfied in most cases.\nOnly the solutions constructed in Theorem 5.1 b), Theorem 5.2 b) on the compact nilmanifold M3 =\n\u0393\\H(2, 1) \u00d7 S 1 , where H(2, 1) is the 5-dimensional Heisenberg group and \u0393 is a lattice, solve in addition\nthe heterotic equations of motion (1.4) with non-zero fluxes and constant dilaton. It seems that these are\nthe first compact supersymmetric solutions to the heterotic equations of motion with non-zero flux H 6= 0,\nnon-flat instanton F A 6= 0 and constant dilaton in dimension six.\n\n\f4\n\nMARISA FERN\u00c1NDEZ, STEFAN IVANOV, LUIS UGARTE, AND RAQUEL VILLACAMPA\n\nOur convention for the curvature is given in Section 3.\n2.

The subgroup of SO(6) fixing the forms F and \u03a8 simultaneously is SU(3).\nThe Lie algebra of SU(3) is denoted su(3).\nThe failure of the holonomy group of the Levi-Civita connection to reduce to SU(3) can be measured by\nthe intrinsic torsion \u03c4 , which is identified with \u2207g F or \u2207g J and can be decomposed into five classes [10],\n\u03c4 \u2208 W1 \u2295* * *\u2295W5 . The intrinsic torsion of an U (n)-structure belongs to the first four components described\nby Gray-Hervella [27]. The five components of an SU(3)-structure are first described by Chiossi-Salamon\n[10] (for interpretation in physics see [9]) and are determined by dF, d\u03a8+ , d\u03a8\u2212 as well as by dF and N .\nThe Hermitian manifolds belong to W3 \u2295 W4 . In the paper we are interested in the class W3 of balanced\nHermitian manifolds [37] characterized by the conditions N = 0, \u03b8 = 0 or, equivalently, N = 0, d \u2217 F = 0.\nNecessary conditions to solve the gravitino equation are given in [18]. The presence of a parallel spinor\nin dimension 6 leads firstly to the reduction to U (3), i.e. the existence of an almost Hermitian structure,\nsecondly to the existence of a linear connection preserving the almost Hermitian structure with torsion\n3-form and thirdly to the reduction of the holonomy group of the torsion connection to SU(3), i.e. its Ricci\n2-form has to be identically zero. It is shown in [18] that there exists a unique linear connection preserving\nan almost Hermitian structure having totally skew-symmetric torsion if and only if the Nijenhuis tensor\nis a 3-form, i.e. the intrinsic torsion \u03c4 \u2208 W1 \u2295 W3 \u2295 W4 . The torsion connection \u2207+ with torsion T is\ndetermined by\n1\nT = JdF + N = \u2212dF (J*, J*, J*) + N.\n\u2207+ = \u2207g + T,\n2\nNecessary and sufficient conditions to solve the gravitino equation in dimension 6 are given in [32].\nNamely, there exists a unique linear connection with torsion 3-form which preserves the almost Hermitian\nstructure whose holonomy is contained in SU(3) if and only if the first Chern class vanishes, c1 (M, J) = 0\nand the SU(3)-structure (M, g, F, \u03a8+ , \u03a8\u2212 ) satisfies the differential equations [32]\n1\n1\nd\u03a8\u2212 = \u03b8 \u2227 \u03a8\u2212 \u2212 (N, \u03a8\u2212 ) \u2217 F.\nd\u03a8+ = \u03b8 \u2227 \u03a8+ \u2212 (N, \u03a8+ ) \u2217 F,\n4\n4\nThe torsion T is given by T = \u2212 \u2217 dF + \u2217(\u03b8 \u2227 F ) + 14 (N, \u03a8+ )\u03a8+ + 14 (N, \u03a8\u2212 )\u03a8\u2212 .\nNecessary and sufficient conditions to solve the gravitino and dilatino equations are presented in [39].\nThe dilatino equation forces the almost complex structure to be integrable (N = 0) and the Lee form\nto be closed (for applications in physics the Lee form has to be exact) determined by the dilaton due to\n\u03b8 = 2d\u03c6 [39]. The three-form field strength H = T = \u2212dF (J*, J*, J*) = \u2212 \u2217 dF + \u2217(2d\u03c6 \u2227 F ). Solutions\nwith constant dilaton are those with zero Lee form, dF n\u22121 = 0, i.e. balanced Hermitian manifolds.\nWhen the almost complex structure is integrable, N = 0, the torsion connection \u2207+ is also known as\nthe Bismut connection (we shall call it Bismut-Strominger (B-S) connection) and was used by Bismut to\nprove local index theorem for the Dolbeault operator on non-Kaehler Hermitian manifolds [7]. This formula\nwas recently applied in string theory [3]. Vanishing theorems for the Dolbeault cohomology on compact\nnon-Kaehler Hermitian manifolds were found in terms of the B-S connection [1, 33, 34].\nIn addition to these equations, the vanishing of the gaugino variation requires the non-zero 2-form F A\nto be of instanton type ([12, 39, 23]).

Proof of Theorem 1.1. A consequence of the gravitino and dilatino Killing equation is the expression\n+\nij\nof the Ricci tensor Ric+\nof the (+)-connection established in [34], Proposition 3.1:\nmn = Rimnj g\n(2.2)\n\n1\n1\n+\ns pq\ns\nRic+\n= \u22122\u2207gm d\u03c6n + d\u03c6s Tmn\n\u2212 dTmspq Jns F pq .\nmn = \u22122\u2207m d\u03c6n \u2212 dTmspq Jn F\n4\n4\n\nThe four-form dT = dJdF is a (2,2)-form with respect to the complex structure J. Therefore, the last\nterm in (2.2) is symmetric.\nOn the other hand, the Ricci tensors of \u2207g and \u2207+ are connected by (see e.g. [18])\n(2.3)\n(2.4)\n\n1 + s\n1\npq\n+\n+ s\ng s\nRic+\nRicgmn = Ric+\nmn \u2212 Ricnm = \u2207s Tmn = \u2207s Tmn ,\nmn + Tmpq Tn \u2212 \u2207s Tmn ,\n4\n2\n1\n1\n+\npq\nRicgmn = (Ric+\nmn + Ricnm ) + Tmpq Tn .\n2\n4\n\nSubstitute (2.2) into (2.4), insert the result into the first equation of (1.4) and use the anomaly cancellation\n(1.1) to conclude (1.5). If R is a (1,1)-form then (1.6) is a consequence of (1.5). It is well known that the\ncurvature of the Chern connection Rc is always a (1,1)-form. When Hol(\u2207+ ) \u2282 su(3) the curvature R\u2212 of\nthe (\u2013)-connection is also an (1,1)-form. This follows from the well known identity\n+\n\u2212\ndTijkl = 2Rijkl\n\u2212 2Rklij\n\n(2.5)\n\nand the fact that dT is a (2,2)-form. This completes the proof of a).\nThe proof of b) is essentially contained in [34, 33]. Indeed, if Hol(\u2207+ ) \u2282 su(3) and R\u2212 is an SU(3)instanton, (2.5) yields dTispq F pq = 0, i.e. the manifold is almost strong in the terminology of [34]. Then\nCorollary 4.2 a) in [34] asserts that there are no holomorphic (3,0) forms which contradicts the result in\n[39] except T = d\u03c6 = 0. This completes the proof of Theorem 1.1.\n2.3.

Six-dimensional balanced Hermitian nilmanifolds. Next we review the main results given in [40]\nconcerning balanced J-Hermitian metrics on M in order to apply them to the construction of solutions to\nthe equations (2.6)-(2.8) above. First of all, if (M, J) admits a balanced J-Hermitian metric (not necessarily\ninvariant) then the Lie algebra g of G is isomorphic to h1 , . . . , h6 or h\u2212\n19 , where h1 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) is the\nabelian Lie algebra and\nh5 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 13 + 42, 14 + 23),\nh6 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 13),\nh\u2212\n19 = (0, 0, 0, 12, 23, 14 \u2212 35).\n\nh2 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 34),\nh3 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12 + 34),\nh4 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 14 + 23),\n\nHere h5 is the Lie algebra underlying the Iwasawa manifold. For the canonical complex structure J0 on\nh5 there exists a complex basis {\u03c9 j }3j=1 of 1-forms of type (1,0) satisfying d\u03c9 1 = d\u03c9 2 = 0 and d\u03c9 3 = \u03c9 12 .\nSince the Lie algebras h2 , . . . , h6 are 2-step nilpotent, for any complex structure J (6= J0 for h5 ) there is\na basis {\u03c9 j }3j=1 of (1,0)-forms such that\n(3.5)\n\nd\u03c9 1 = d\u03c9 2 = 0,\n\nd\u03c9 3 = \u03c1 \u03c9 12 + \u03c9 11\u0304 + B \u03c9 12\u0304 + D \u03c9 22\u0304 ,\n\nwhere B, D \u2208 C, and \u03c1 = 0, 1. In particular, J is a nilpotent complex structure on h2 , . . . , h6 in the sense\n[11]. Recall that a complex structure J on a 2n-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra g is called nilpotent if\nthere is a basis {\u03c9 j }nj=1 of (1,0)-forms satisfying d\u03c9 1 = 0 and\n^2\n(\u03c9 1 , . . . , \u03c9 j\u22121 , \u03c9 1 , . . . , \u03c9 j\u22121 ),\nd\u03c9 j \u2208\nfor j = 2, * * * , n.\nj 3\nAny complex structure on the Lie algebra h\u2212\n19 is not nilpotent and there is a (1,0)-basis {\u03c9 }j=1 satisfying\n\n(3.6)\n\nd\u03c9 1 = 0,\n\nd\u03c9 2 = E \u03c9 13 + \u03c9 13\u0304 ,\n\nd\u03c9 3 = C \u03c9 11\u0304 + ia \u03c9 12\u0304 \u2212 ia\u0112 \u03c9 21\u0304 ,\n\nwhere E \u2208 C with |E| = 1, C\u0304 = CE and a \u2208 R \u2212 {0}.\nNow, the fundamental form F of any invariant J-Hermitian structure is given in terms of the basis\n{\u03c9 j }3j=1 by\n(3.7)\n\n2 F = i(r2 \u03c9 11\u0304 + s2 \u03c9 22\u0304 + t2 \u03c9 33\u0304 ) + u \u03c9 12\u0304 \u2212 \u016b \u03c9 21\u0304 + v \u03c9 23\u0304 \u2212 v\u0304 \u03c9 32\u0304 + z \u03c9 13\u0304 \u2212 z\u0304 \u03c9 31\u0304 ,\n\nwhere r, s, t \u2208 R\u2212{0} and u, v, z \u2208 C must satisfy those restrictions coming from the positive definiteness of\nthe associated metric g(X, Y ) = \u2212F (X, JY ). The following result gives necessary and suficient conditions,\nin terms of the different coefficients involved, in order the Hermitian structure to be balanced.\nProposition 3.1. [40] In the notation above, we have:\n(i) If J is a nonnilpotent complex structure defined by (3.6), then (J, F ) is balanced if and only if\nz = \u2212iuv/s2\n\nand\n\nCs2 + a\u0112u + a\u016b = 0.\n\n(ii) If J is a nilpotent complex structure defined by (3.5), then (J, F ) is balanced if and only if\ns2 t2 \u2212 |v|2 + D(r2 t2 \u2212 |z|2 ) = B(it2 \u016b \u2212 vz\u0304).\n4. The Iwasawa manifold revisited\nApart from the abelian Lie algebra, h5 is the only 6-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra which can be given\na complex Lie algebra structure. The corresponding complex parallelizable nilmanifold is the well-known\nIwasawa manifold. This manifold is studied in [9]; however, as it is pointed out in the introduction, this\nexample is not a valid solution due to a sign error in the torsional equation. Here we show that there are no\nvalid solutions on the Iwasawa manifold, a fact which leads us to study more general complex nilmanifolds\nin the subsequent sections.\nThe standard complex structure J0 on h5 is defined by the following complex structure equations:\nd\u03c9 1 = d\u03c9 2 = 0,\nFor any t 6= 0, let us consider F given by\nF =\n\nd\u03c9 3 = \u03c9 12 .\n\ni 11\u0304\n(\u03c9 + \u03c9 22\u0304 + t2 \u03c9 33\u0304 ).\n2\n\n\f8\n\nMARISA FERN\u00c1NDEZ, STEFAN IVANOV, LUIS UGARTE, AND RAQUEL VILLACAMPA\n\nIt is easy to see that the Hermitian structure (J0 , F ) is balanced for any value of the parameter.\nNotice that the Iwasawa manifold is a T2 bundle over T4 , where the parameter t scales the fiber.\nFrom a real point of view, let us consider the real basis of 1-forms {e1 , . . . , e6 } given by\ne1 + i e2 = \u03c9 1 ,\n\ne3 + i e4 = \u03c9 2 ,\n\ne5 + i e6 = t \u03c9 3 .\n\nNow, in terms of this basis, we have that the structure equations are\n\uf8f1 1\nde = de2 = de3 = de4 = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nde5 = t e13 \u2212 t e24 ,\n(4.1)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 6\nde = t e14 + t e23 ,\n\nthe complex structure J0 is given by J0 e1 = \u2212e2 , J0 e3 = \u2212e4 , J0 e5 = \u2212e6 , the J0 -Hermitian metric\ng = e1 \u2297 e1 + * * * + e6 \u2297 e6 has the associated fundamental form F = e12 + e34 + e56 .

Moreover, the whole space of complex structures\ncompatible with the canonical metric obtained when t = 1 in (4.1) is studied in [9] where the authors proved\nthat the behavior is the same as in (4.3).\nRemark 4.1. It is not difficult to prove that any J0 -Hermitian metric is equivalent to one in the 1parameter family given above. Since dT \u2212 4t2 e1234 , in view of (4.2) there is no way to find a satisfactory\nsolution with J0 as the underlying complex structure. In fact, it is proved in [5] that torus bundles over\nthe complex torus can not be solutions to (1.2) and (1.1) taking with respect to the curvature of the Chern\nconnection R = Rc with \u03b1\u2032 > 0, which implies that p1 (A) cannot be a positive multiple of e1234 for any\nSU(3)-instanton A on the Iwasawa manifold, so (1.1) cannot be satisfied neither for R = Rg nor for\nR = R\u00b1 .\nTherefore, in order to find solutions we need to consider other compact nilmanifolds or metrics and/or\ncomplex structures different from the canonical ones on the nilmanifold underlying the Iwasawa manifold.\nIn the following sections we show many explicit solutions.\n5. A family of balanced Hermitian structures on the Lie algebra h3\nIn this section we construct explicit solutions on compact nilmanifold corresponding to the Lie algebra\nh3 . First we recall [40] that, up to equivalence, there exist two complex structures J \u00b1 on h3 , namely\nJ \u00b1 : d\u03c9 1 = d\u03c9 2 = 0,\n\nd\u03c9 3 = \u03c9 11\u0304 \u00b1 \u03c9 22\u0304 ,\n\nbut only J \u2212 admits compatible balanced structures. Notice that the balanced condition for J \u2212 given in\nProposition 3.1 (ii) reduces to\n(r2 \u2212 s2 )t2 = |z|2 \u2212 |v|2 .\nFor any t 6= 0, let us consider the balanced structure F given by\ni\nF = (\u03c9 11\u0304 + \u03c9 22\u0304 + t2 \u03c9 33\u0304 ),\n2\nwhich corresponds to r = s = 1 and u = v = z = 0.\nFrom a real point of view, let us consider the basis of 1-forms {e1 , . . . , e6 } given by\ne1 + i e2 = \u03c9 1 ,\n\ne3 + i e4 = \u03c9 2 ,\n\ne5 + i e6 = t \u03c9 3 .\n\nNow, in terms of this basis, we have the structure equations\n( 1\nde = de2 = de3 = de4 = de5 = 0,\n(5.1)\nde6 = \u22122t e12 + 2t e34 ,\n\nand the complex structure J = J \u2212 is given by Je1 = \u2212e2 , Je3 = \u2212e4 , Je5 = \u2212e6 . The balanced JHermitian metric g = e1 \u2297 e1 + * * * + e6 \u2297 e6 has the associated fundamental form F = e12 + e34 + e56 .\nThe structure equations (5.1) yield dF = 2t(e12 \u2212 e34 )e5 . For the torsion T of \u2207+ we calculate using (3.1),\n(3.2) and (3.3) that\nT = \u22122t(e12 \u2212 e34 )e6 ,\n\ndT = \u22128t2 e1234 ,\n\n\u2207+ T = 0.\n\nA direct calculation applying (3.2) and (3.3) shows that the non-zero curvature forms (\u03a9g )ij of the\nLevi-Civita connection \u2207g are given by\n(\u03a9g )12 = \u2212t2 (3 e12 \u2212 2 e34 ),\n\n(\u03a9g )24 = t2 e13 ,\n\n(\u03a9g )13 = t2 e24 ,\n\n(\u03a9g )26 = t2 e26 ,\n\n(\u03a9g )14 = \u2212t2 e23 ,\n\n(\u03a9g )34 = t2 (2 e12 \u2212 3 e34 ),\n\n(\u03a9g )16 = t2 e16 ,\n\n(\u03a9g )36 t2 e36 ,\n\nand the non-zero curvature forms (\u03a9+ )ij of the connection \u2207+ are\n(5.2)\n\n(\u03a9+ )12 = \u2212(\u03a9+ )34 = \u22124t2 (e12 \u2212 e34 ).\n\nTherefore, (2.6) is satisfied and the Pontrjagin classes are represented by\np1 (\u2207g ) =\n\n\u22123t4 1234\ne\n,\n\u03c02\n\np1 (\u2207+ ) =\n\n\u22128t4 1234\ne\n.\n\u03c02\n\n(\u03a9g )23 = \u2212t2 e14 ,\n\n(\u03a9g )46 = t2 e46 ,\n\n\f10\n\nMARISA FERN\u00c1NDEZ, STEFAN IVANOV, LUIS UGARTE, AND RAQUEL VILLACAMPA\n\nNow, let us consider the new basis {f 1 , . . . , f 6 } given by f i = ei , for i = 1, . . . , 5, and f 6 =\nterms of this basis, the structure equations (5.1) become\ndf 1 = df 2 = df 3 = df 4 = df 5 = 0,\n\n1 6\nte .\n\nIn\n\ndf 6 = \u22122 f 12 + 2 f 34 ,\n\nand the family (Jt , gt ) of balanced Hermitian SU(3)-structures on h3 is given by\nJt f 1 = \u2212f 2 ,\n\nJt f 2 = f 1 ,\n\nJt f 3 = \u2212f 4 ,\n\nJt f 4 = f 3 ,\n\ng t = f 1 \u2297 f 1 + * * * + f 5 \u2297 f 5 + t2 f 6 \u2297 f 6 ,\n\nJt f 5 = \u2212t f 6 ,\n\nJt f 6 =\n\n1 5\nf ,\nt\n\nFt = f 12 + f 34 + t f 56 .\n\nLet us fix t\u2032 6= 0 and denote by \u2207+\nt\u2032 the connection corresponding to the balanced structure (Jt\u2032 , gt\u2032 ) in\n+\ni\nthe previous family.

The nilpotent Lie algebra h3 is the Lie algebra underlying the compact nilmanifold M3 = \u0393\\H(2, 1)\u00d7\nS1.\nTheorem 5.1. In the notation above, for each t\u2032 6= t, we consider the SU(3)-instanton \u2207+\nt\u2032 .

In\nfact, we can take dz1 and dz2 as (2,0)-forms at the level of the Lie group H(2, 1) \u00d7 R which descend to the\nforms \u03c9 1 and \u03c9 2 on the compact nilmanifold M3 .\nTheorem 5.2.

Let A\u03bb,\u03bc be the SU(3)-instanton above.\n4\n, then\n(i) If \u03bc2 = 15\ndT = 4\u03c0 2 (p1 (\u2207+ ) \u2212 p1 (A\u03bb,\u03bc )).\n(ii) If \u03bc = 0, then p1 (A\u03bb,0 ) = 0 and\ndT = 4\u03c0 2 (p1 (\u2207c ) \u2212 p1 (A\u03bb,0 )).\n\nHence, we obtain explicit valid solutions to the heterotic supersymmetry equations (1.2) with non-zero flux\nH = T and constant dilaton satisfying the three-form Bianchi identity (1.1) for the Chern connection and\nthe (+)-connection on the compact nilmanifold M19 .\nRemark 8.3. During the preparation of the paper we learned that a compact example solving (1.2) with\nnon-zero flux, constant dilaton satisfying (1.1) with respect to a metric connection on the tangent bundle,\nand trivial instanton (A = 0) on M3 is announced [26].\nAcknowledgments.
