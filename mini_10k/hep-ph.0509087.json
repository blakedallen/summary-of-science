One\nmay also take a broader view of string theory as a description of string-like excitations\nthat arise in many different physical systems, such as the superconducting flux tubes,\ncosmic strings, and of course the chromoelectric flux tubes in non-Abelian gauge theories, which are the subject of my talk. You\ncould object that these string-like excitations\nare \"emergent\" rather than fundamental phenomena. We will see, however, that there\nis no sharp distinction between \"emergent\"\nand fundamental strings. We will exhibit\nexamples, stemming from the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence3,4,5, where the \"emergent\"\nand fundamental strings are dual descriptions\nof the same theory. Besides being of great\ntheoretical interest, such gauge/string dualities are becoming a useful tool for studying\nstrongly coupled gauge theories. A developing connection that is highlighted in this\ntalk is with the new results at RHIC:6 there\nare indications that a rather strongly coupled\nQuark-Gluon Plasma (sQGP) has been oba Due\n\nto a strict length limit, I did not include figures\nin this manuscript. The figures are included in the\nPowerPoint version of this talk, available at the 2005\nLepton-Photon Symposium web site.\n\nserved.\n2\n\nSome early history\n\nString Theory was born out of attempts to\nunderstand the Strong Interactions. Empirical evidence for a string-like structure of\nhadrons comes from arranging mesons and\nbaryons into approximately linear Regge trajectories. Studies of \u03c0N scattering prompted\nDolen, Horn and Schmid7 to make a duality conjecture stating that the sum over schannel exchanges equals the sum over tchannel ones. This posed the problem of finding the analytic form of such dual amplitudes.\nVeneziano8 found the first, and very simple,\nexpression for a manifestly dual 4-point amplitude:\nA(s, t) \u223c\n\n\u0393(\u2212\u03b1(s))\u0393(\u2212\u03b1(t))\n\u0393(\u2212\u03b1(s) \u2212 \u03b1(t))\n\n(1)\n\nwith an exactly linear Regge trajectory\n\u03b1(s) = \u03b1(0) + \u03b1\u2032 s. Soon after, Nambu9 ,\nNielsen10 and Susskind11 independently proposed its open string interpretation. This led\nto an explosion of interest in the early 70's in\nstring theory as a description of strongly interacting particles. The basic idea is to think\nof a meson as an open string with a quark at\none end-point and an anti-quark at another.\nThen various meson states arise as different\nexcitations of such an open string. The split-\n\n\fFor Publisher's use\nting of a string describes the decay of a meson\ninto two mesons, for example.\nThe string world sheet dynamics is governed by the Nambu-Goto area action\nZ\np\nSNG = \u2212T d\u03c3d\u03c4 \u2212det \u2202a X \u03bc \u2202b X\u03bc , (2)\n\nwhere the indexes a, b take two values ranging over the \u03c3 and \u03c4 directions on the world\nsheet. The string tension is related to the\n1\nRegge slope through T = 2\u03c0\u03b1\n\u2032 . The quantum\nconsistency of the Veneziano model requires\nthat the Regge intercept is \u03b1(0) = 1, so that\nthe spin 1 state is massless but the spin 0 is\na tachyon. But the \u03c1 meson is certainly not\nmassless, and there are no tachyons in the\nreal world. This is how the string theory of\nstrong interactions started to run into problems.\nCalculation of the string zero-point energy gives\nd\u22122\n.\n(3)\n24\nHence the model has to be defined in 26\nspace-time dimensions. Attempts to quantize such a string model directly in 3+1 dimensions led to tachyons and problems with\nunitarity. Consistent supersymmetric string\ntheories were discovered in 10 dimensions,\nbut their relation to the strong interactions\nwas initially completely unclear. Most importantly, the Asymptotic Freedom of strong\ninteractions was discovered12, singling out\nQuantum Chromodynamics (QCD) as the exact field theory of strong interactions. At this\npoint most physicists gave up on strings as a\ndescription of strong interactions. Instead,\nsince the graviton appears naturally in the\nclosed string spectrum, string theory emerged\nas the leading hope for unifying quantum\ngravity with other forces13 .\n\u03b1(0) =\n\n3\n\nQCD gives strings a chance\n\nNow that we know that a non-Abelian gauge\ntheory is an exact description of strong interactions, is there any room left for string\n\ntheory in this field? Luckily, the answer is\npositive. At short distances, much smaller\nthan 1 fermi, the quark anti-quark potential\nis Coulombic, due to Asymptotic Freedom.\nAt large distances the potential should be\nlinear due to formation of a confining flux\ntube14 . When these tubes are much longer\nthan their thickness, one can hope to describe them, at least approximately, by semiclassical Nambu strings15 . This appears to\nexplain the existence of approximately linear\nRegge trajectories: a linear relation between\nangular momentum and mass-squared\nJ = \u03b1\u2032 m2 + \u03b1(0) ,\n\n(4)\n\nis provided by a semi-classical spinning relativistic string with massless quark and antiquark at its endpoints. A semi-classical\nstring approach to the QCD flux tubes is\nwidely used, for example, in jet hadronization algorithms based on the Lund String\nModel16 .\nSemi-classical quantization around a long\nstraight Nambu string predicts the quark\nanti-quark potential17\n\u03b3\nV (r) = T r + \u03bc + + O(1/r2 ) .\n(5)\nr\nThe coefficient \u03b3 of the universal L\u00fcscher\nterm depends only on the space-time dimension d and is proportional to the Regge intercept: \u03b3 = \u2212\u03c0(d \u2212 2)/24. Recent lattice calculations of the force vs. distance for\nprobe quarks and anti-quarks18 produce good\nagreement with this value in d = 3 and d = 4\nfor r > 0.7f m. Thus, long QCD strings appear to be well described by the Nambu-Goto\narea action. But quantization of short, highly\nquantum QCD strings, that could lead to a\ncalculation of light meson and glueball spectra, is a much harder problem.\nThe connection of gauge theory with\nstring theory is strengthened by 't Hooft's\ngeneralization of QCD from 3 colors (SU (3)\ngauge group) to N colors (SU (N ) gauge\ngroup)19 . The idea is to make N large, while\n2\nkeeping the 't Hooft coupling \u03bb = gYM\nN\n\n\fFor Publisher's use\nfixed. In this limit each Feynman graph carries a topological factor N \u03c7 , where \u03c7 is the\nEuler characteristic of the graph. Thus, the\nsum over graphs of a given topology can perhaps be thought of as a sum over world sheets\nof a hypothetical \"QCD string.\" Since the\nspheres (string tree diagrams) are weighted\nby N 2 , the tori (string one-loop diagrams) \u2013\nby N 0 , etc., we find that the closed string\ncoupling constant is of order N \u22121 . Thus, the\nadvantage of taking N to be large is that\nwe find a weakly coupled string theory. In\nthe large N limit the gauge theory simplifies in that only the planar diagrams contribute. But directly summing even this subclass of diagrams seems to be an impossible\ntask. From the dual QCD string point of\nview, it is not clear how to describe this string\ntheory in elementary terms.\nBecause of the difficulty of these problems, between the late 70's and the mid-90's\nmany theorists gave up hope of finding an\nexact gauge/string duality. One notable exception is Polyakov who already in 1981 proposed that the string theory dual to a 4d gauge theory should have a 5-th hidden\ndimension20 . In later work21 he refined this\nproposal, suggesting that the 5-d metric must\nbe \"warped.\"\n4\n\nThe Geometry of Dirichlet\nBranes\n\nIn the mid-nineties the Dirichlet branes, or\nD-branes for short, brought string theory\nback to gauge theory. The D-branes are\nsoliton-like \"membranes\" of various internal dimensionalities contained in theories of\nclosed superstrings2 . A Dirichlet p-brane (or\nDp-brane) is a p + 1 dimensional hyperplane\nin 9 + 1 dimensional space-time where strings\nare allowed to end. A D-brane is much like a\ntopological defect: upon touching a D-brane,\na closed string can open up and turn into an\nopen string whose ends are free to move along\nthe D-brane. For the end-points of such a\n\nstring the p + 1 longitudinal coordinates satisfy the conventional free (Neumann) boundary conditions, while the 9 \u2212 p coordinates\ntransverse to the Dp-brane have the fixed\n(Dirichlet) boundary conditions; hence the\norigin of the term \"Dirichlet brane.\" In a\nseminal paper22 Polchinski showed that a Dpbrane preserves 1/2 of the bulk supersymmetries and carries an elementary unit of charge\nwith respect to the p+1 form gauge potential\nfrom the Ramond-Ramond sector of type II\nsuperstring.\nFor our purposes, the most important\nproperty of D-branes is that they realize\ngauge theories on their world volume. The\nmassless spectrum of open strings living on\na Dp-brane is that of a maximally supersymmetric U (1) gauge theory in p+1 dimensions.\nThe 9 \u2212 p massless scalar fields present in\nthis supermultiplet are the expected Goldstone modes associated with the transverse\noscillations of the Dp-brane, while the photons and fermions provide the unique supersymmetric completion. If we consider N parallel D-branes, then there are N 2 different\nspecies of open strings because they can begin and end on any of the D-branes. N 2 is\nthe dimension of the adjoint representation\nof U (N ), and indeed we find the maximally\nsupersymmetric U (N ) gauge theory in this\nsetting.\nThe relative separations of the Dp-branes\nin the 9 \u2212 p transverse dimensions are determined by the expectation values of the\nscalar fields. We will be interested in the\ncase where all scalar expectation values vanish, so that the N Dp-branes are stacked on\ntop of each other. If N is large, then this\nstack is a heavy object embedded into a theory of closed strings which contains gravity.\nNaturally, this macroscopic object will curve\nspace: it may be described by some classical\nmetric and other background fields. Thus,\nwe have two very different descriptions of the\nstack of Dp-branes: one in terms of the U (N )\nsupersymmetric gauge theory on its world\n\n\fFor Publisher's use\nvolume, and the other in terms of the classical charged p-brane background of the type\nII closed superstring theory. The relation between these two descriptions is at the heart\nof the connections between gauge fields and\nstrings that are the subject of this talk.\n4.1\n\nCoincident D3-branes\n\nParallel D3-branes realize a 3 + 1 dimensional\nU (N ) gauge theory, which is a maximally supersymmetric \"cousin\" of QCD. Let us compare a stack of D3-branes with the RamondRamond charged black 3-brane classical solution whose metric assumes the form23 :\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds2 = H \u22121/2 (r) \u2212f (r)(dx0 )2 + (dxi )2\n\u0003\n\u0002\n+ H 1/2 (r) f \u22121 (r)dr2 + r2 d\u03a925 , (6)\n\nwhere i = 1, 2, 3 and\nH(r) = 1 +\n\nL4\n,\nr4\n\nf (r) = 1 \u2212\n\nr04\n.\nr4\n\nHere d\u03a925 is the metric of a unit 5 dimensional\nsphere, S5 .\nIn general, a d-dimensional sphere of radius L may be defined by a constraint\nd+1\nX\n(X i )2 = L2\n\n(7)\n\ni=1\n\non d+1 real coordinates X i . It is a positively\ncurved maximally symmetric space with symmetry group SO(d + 1). Similarly, the ddimensional Anti-de Sitter space, AdSd , is\ndefined by a constraint\nd\u22121\nX\n(X i )2 = L2 ,\n(X 0 )2 + (X d )2 \u2212\n\nwhere z \u2208 [0, \u221e). In these coordinates the\nboundary of AdSd is at z = 0.\nThe event horizon of the black 3-brane\nmetric (6) is located at r = r0 .

Introducing z = Lr , one notes\nthat the limiting form of (10) as r \u2192 0 factorizes into the direct product of two smooth\nspaces, the Poincar\u00e9 wedge (9) of AdS5 , and\nS5 , with equal radii of curvature L. The\n3-brane geometry may be thus viewed as a\nsemi-infinite throat of radius L which for\nr \u226b L opens up into flat 9 + 1 dimensional\nspace. Thus, for L\u221amuch larger than the\nstring length scale, \u03b1\u2032 , the entire 3-brane\ngeometry has small curvatures everywhere\nand is appropriately described by the supergravity approximation to type IIB string theory.\n\u221a\nThe relation between L and \u03b1\u2032 may be\nfound by equating the gravitational tension\nof the extremal 3-brane classical solution to\nN times the tension of a single D3-brane, and\none finds\n2\nL4 = gYM\nN \u03b1\u20322 .\n\n(11)\n\n(8)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere L is its curvature radius. AdSd is\na negatively curved maximally symmetric\nspace with symmetry group SO(2, d \u2212 2).\nThere exists a subspace of AdSd called the\nPoincar\u00e9 wedge, with the metric\n!\nd\u22122\n2\nX\nL\n(dxi )2 ,\nds2 = 2 dz 2 \u2212 (dx0 )2 +\nz\ni=1\n(9)\n\nThus, the size of the throat in string units\nis \u03bb1/4 . This remarkable emergence of the\n't Hooft coupling from gravitational considerations is at the heart of the success of the\nAdS/CFT correspondence.\nMoreover, the re\u221a\nquirement L \u226b \u03b1\u2032 translates into \u03bb \u226b 1:\nthe gravitational approach is valid when the\n't Hooft coupling is very strong and the perturbative field theoretic methods are not applicable.\n\n\fFor Publisher's use\n5\n\nThe AdS/CFT Correspondence\n\nConsideration of low-energy processes in the\n3-brane background24 indicates that, in the\nlow-energy limit, the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 throat region (r \u226a L) decouples from the asymptotically flat large r region. Similarly, the\nN = 4 supersymmetric SU (N ) gauge theory on the stack of N D3-branes decouples in the low-energy limit from the bulk\nclosed string theory. Such considerations\nprompted Maldacena3 to conjecture that\ntype IIB string theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S5 , of radius L given in (11), is dual to the N = 4\nSYM theory. The number of colors in the\ngauge theory, N , is dual to the number of flux\nunits of the 5-form Ramond-Ramond field\nstrength.\nIt was further conjectured in 4,5 that\nthere exists a one-to-one map between gauge\ninvariant operators in the CFT and fields\n(or extended objects) in AdS5 . The dimension \u2206 of an operator is determined by the\nmass of the dual field in AdS5 . For example, for scalar operators one finds that\n\u2206(\u2206\u22124) = m2 L2 . Precise methods for calculating correlation functions of various operators in a CFT using its dual formulation were\nalso formulated4,5 . They involve calculating\nthe string theory path integral as a function\nof the boundary conditions in AdS5 , which\nare imposed near z = 0.\nIf the number of colors N is sent to in2\nfinity while gYM\nN is held fixed and large,\nthen there are small string scale corrections\nto the supergravity limit3,4,5 which proceed\n\u0001\u22121/2\n\u2032\n2\nN\n. If we wish\nin powers of L\u03b12 = gYM\nto study finite N , then there are also string\n\u03ba2\n\u22122\n. As\nloop corrections in powers of L\n8 \u223c N\nexpected, taking N to infinity enables us to\ntake the classical limit of the string theory on\nAdS5 \u00d7 S5 .\nImmediate\nsupport for the AdS/CFT correspondence comes\nfrom symmetry considerations3. The isometry group of AdS5 is SO(2, 4), and this is also\n\nthe conformal group in 3 + 1 dimensions. In\naddition we have the isometries of S5 which\nform SU (4) \u223c SO(6). This group is identical\nto the R-symmetry of the N = 4 SYM theory. After including the fermionic generators\nrequired by supersymmetry, the full isometry\nsupergroup of the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 background is\nSU (2, 2|4), which is identical to the N = 4\nsuperconformal symmetry.\nTo formulate an AdS/CFT duality with\na reduced amount of supersymmetry, we may\nplace the stack of D3-branes at the tip of a\n6-dimensional Ricci flat cone,25,26,27 whose\nbase is a 5-dimensional compact Einstein\nspace Y5 . The metric of such a cone is\ndr2 + r2 ds2Y ; therefore, the 10-d metric produced by the D3-branes is obtained from (10)\nby replacing d\u03a925 , the metric on S5 , by ds2Y ,\nthe metric on Y5 . In the r \u2192 0 limit we then\nfind the space AdS5 \u00d7 Y5 as the candidate\ndual of the CFT on the D3-branes placed at\nthe tip of the cone. The isometry group of Y5\nis smaller than SO(6), but AdS5 is the \"universal\" factor present in the dual description\nof any large N CFT, making the SO(2, 4)\nconformal symmetry geometric.\nThe fact that after the compactification\non Y5 the string theory is 5-dimensional supports earlier ideas on the necessity of the 5-th\ndimension to describe 4-d gauge theories20 .\nThe z-direction is dual to the energy scale of\nthe gauge theory: small z corresponds to the\nUV domain of the gauge theory, while large\nz to the IR.\nIn the AdS/CFT duality, type IIB strings\nare dual to the chromo-electric flux lines in\nthe gauge theory, providing a string theoretic set-up for calculating the quark antiquark potential28 . The quark and anti-quark\nare placed near the boundary of Anti-de Sitter space (z = 0), and the fundamental\nstring connecting them is required to obey\nthe equations of motion following from the\nNambu action. The string bends into the interior (z > 0), and the maximum value of\nthe z-coordinate increases with the separa-\n\n\fFor Publisher's use\ntion r between quarks. An explicit calculation of the string action gives an attractive\nq q\u0304 potential28 :\n\u221a\n4\u03c0 2 \u03bb\n(12)\nV (r) = \u2212\n\u00014 .\n\u0393 41 r\n\nIts Coulombic 1/r dependence is required by\nthe conformal invariance of the theory. Historically, a dual string description was hoped\nfor mainly in the cases of confining gauge theories, where long confining flux tubes have\nstring-like properties. In a pleasant surprise,\nwe have seen that a string description can be\napplicable to non-confining theories too, due\nto the presence of extra dimensions in the\nstring theory.\n5.1\n\nSpinning Strings vs. Long\nOperators\n\nA few years ago it was noted that the\nAdS/CFT duality becomes particularly powerful when applied to operators with large\nquantum numbers.\nOne class of such\nsingle-trace \"long operators\" are the BMN\noperators29 that carry a large R-charge in the\nSYM theory and contain a finite number of\nimpurity insertions. The R-charge is dual to\na string angular momentum on the compact\nspace Y5 . So, in the BMN limit the relevant\nstates are short closed strings with a large\nangular momentum, and a small amount of\nvibrational excitation. Furthermore, by increasing the number of impurities the string\ncan be turned into a large semi-classical object moving in AdS5 \u00d7 Y5 . Comparing such\nobjects with their dual long operators has become a very fruitful area of research30 . Work\nin this direction has also produced a great\ndeal of evidence that the N = 4 SYM theory is exactly integrable (see 31,32 for recent\nreviews).\nA familiar example of a gauge theory\noperator with a large quantum number is\na twist-2 operator carrying a large spin J,\nJ\u22122\nTr F+\u03bc D+\nF+ \u03bc . In QCD, such operators\n\nplay an important role in studies of deep inelastic scattering33 . In the N = 4 SYM theory, the dual of such a high-spin operator is\na folded string spinning around the center\nof AdS5 .34 In general, for a high spin, the\nanomalous dimension of such an operator is\n35\n\n\u2206 \u2212 (J + 2) \u2192 f (\u03bb) ln J .\n\n(13)\n\nCalculating the energy of the spinning folded\nstring, we find that the AdS/CFT prediction\nis34\n\u221a\n\u03bb\nf (\u03bb) \u2192\n,\n(14)\n\u03c0\nin the limit of large 't Hooft coupling.

Thus, the series has a finite radius of convergence, in accord with general\narguments about planar gauge theory given\nby 't Hooft. The fact that the branch point\nis at a negative \u03bb suggests that in the N = 4\nSYM theory the perturbative series is alternating, and that there is no problem in extrapolating from small to large \u03bb along the\npositive real axis. It is, of course, highly desirable to find an exact formula for f (\u03bb). Recent work37 raises hopes that a solution of\nthis problem is within reach.\n6\n\n6.1\n\nThermal Gauge Theory from\nNear-extremal D3-branes\nEntropy\n\nAn important black hole observable is the\nBekenstein-Hawking (BH) entropy, which is\n\n\fFor Publisher's use\nproportional to the area of the event horizon,\nSBH = Ah /(4G). For the 3-brane solution\n(6), the horizon is located at r = r0 . For r0 >\n0 the 3-brane carries some excess energy E\nabove its extremal value, and the BH entropy\nis also non-vanishing. The Hawking temperature is then defined by T \u22121 = \u2202SBH /\u2202E.\nSetting r0 \u226a L in (10), we obtain a nearextremal 3-brane geometry, whose Hawking\ntemperature is found to be T = r0 /(\u03c0L2 ).\nThe small r limit of this geometry is S5\ntimes a certain black hole in AdS5 . The 8dimensional \"area\" of the event horizon is\nAh = \u03c0 6 L8 T 3 V3 , where V3 is the spatial volume of the D3-brane (i.e. the volume of the\nx1 , x2 , x3 coordinates). Therefore, the BH\nentropy is38\nSBH =\n\n\u03c02 2\nN V3 T 3 .\n2\n\n(17)\n\nThis gravitational entropy of a near-extremal\n3-brane of Hawking temperature T is to be\nidentified with the entropy of N = 4 supersymmetric U (N ) gauge theory (which lives\non N coincident D3-branes) heated up to the\nsame temperature.\nThe entropy of a free U (N ) N = 4 supermultiplet, which consists of the gauge field,\n6N 2 massless scalars and 4N 2 Weyl fermions,\ncan be calculated using the standard statistical mechanics of a massless gas (the black\nbody problem), and the answer is\nS0 =\n\n2\u03c0 2 2\nN V3 T 3 .\n3\n\n(18)\n\nIt is remarkable that the 3-brane geometry\ncaptures the T 3 scaling characteristic of a\nconformal field theory (in a CFT this scaling is guaranteed by the extensivity of the\nentropy and the absence of dimensionful parameters). Also, the N 2 scaling indicates the\npresence of O(N 2 ) unconfined degrees of freedom, which is exactly what we expect in the\nN = 4 supersymmetric U (N ) gauge theory.\nBut what is the explanation of the relative\nfactor of 3/4 between SBH and S0 ? In fact,\nthis factor is not a contradiction but rather a\n\nprediction about the strongly coupled N = 4\nSYM theory at finite temperature. As we\nargued above, the supergravity calculation\nof the BH entropy, (17), is relevant to the\n\u03bb \u2192 \u221e limit of the N = 4 SU (N ) gauge\ntheory, while the free field calculation, (18),\napplies to the \u03bb \u2192 0 limit. Thus, the relative\nfactor of 3/4 is not a discrepancy: it relates\ntwo different limits of the theory. Indeed, on\ngeneral field theoretic grounds, in the 't Hooft\nlarge N limit the entropy is given by39\n2\u03c0 2 2\nN f (\u03bb)V3 T 3 .\n(19)\n3\nThe function f is certainly not constant:\nFeynman graph calculations valid for small\n2\n\u03bb = gYM\nN give40\n\u221a\n3 + 2 3/2\n3\n\u03bb + . . .

The 1/4 deficit\ncompared to the free field value is a strong\ncoupling effect predicted by the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence.\nIt is interesting that similar deficits\nhave been observed in lattice simulations\nof deconfined non-supersymmetric gauge\ntheories41,42,43 . The ratio of entropy to its\nfree field value, calculated as a function of\nthe temperature, is found to level off at values around 0.8 for T beyond 3 times the deconfinement temperature Tc . This is often\ninterpreted as the effect of a sizable coupling.\nIndeed, for T = 3Tc , the lattice estimates in2\ndicate that gYM\nN \u2248 7.42 This challenges an\nold prejudice that the QGP is inherently very\nweakly coupled. We now turn to calculations\nlim f (\u03bb) =\n\n\u03bb\u2192\u221e\n\n\fFor Publisher's use\nof the shear viscosity where strong coupling\neffects are even more pronounced.\n6.2\n\nShear Viscosity\n\nThe shear viscosity \u03b7 may be read off from\nthe form of the stress-energy tensor in the\nlocal rest frame of the fluid where T0i = 0:\n2\nTij = p\u03b4ij \u2212 \u03b7(\u2202i uj + \u2202j ui \u2212 \u03b4ij \u2202k uk ) , (23)\n3\nwhere ui is the 3-velocity field. The viscosity\ncan be also determined44 through the Kubo\nformula\nZ\n1\ndtd3 xei\u03c9t h[Txy (t, ~x), Txy (0, 0)]i\n\u03b7 = lim\n\u03c9\u21920 2\u03c9\n(24)\nFor the N = 4 supersymmetric YM theory\nthis 2-point function may be computed from\nabsorption of a low-energy graviton hxy by\nthe 3-brane metric24 . Using this method, it\nwas found44 that at very strong coupling\n\u03c0\n(25)\n\u03b7 = N 2T 3 ,\n8\nwhich implies\nh\u0304\n\u03b7\n=\n(26)\ns\n4\u03c0\nafter h\u0304 is restored in the calculation (here\ns = S/V3 is the entropy density). It has\nbeen proposed45 that this value is the universal lower bound on \u03b7/s. Indeed, at weak\n1\ncoupling \u03b7/s is very large, \u223c \u03bb2 ln(1/\u03bb)\n, and\nthere is evidence that it decreases monotonically as the coupling is increased46 .\nThe appearance of h\u0304 in (26) is reasonable\non general physical grounds45 . The shear viscosity \u03b7 is of order the energy density times\nquasi-particle mean free time \u03c4 . So, \u03b7/s is of\norder of the energy of a quasi-particle times\nits mean free time, which is bounded from below by the uncertainty principle to be some\nconstant times h\u0304. The AdS/CFT correspondence fixes this constant to be 1/(4\u03c0), which\nis not far from some earlier estimates47 .\nFor known fluids (e.g. helium, nitrogen, water) \u03b7/s is considerably higher than\nthe proposed lower bound45 . On the other\n\nhand, the Quark-Gluon Plasma produced at\nRHIC is believed to have a very low \u03b7/s,\nwithin a factor of 2 of the bound (26)48,47 .\nThis suggests that it is rather strongly coupled. Recently a new term, sQGP, which\nstands for \"strongly coupled Quark-Gluon\nPlasma,\" has been coined to describe the\ndeconfined state observed at RHIC49,50 (a\nsomewhat different term, \"Non-perturbative\nQuark-Gluon Plasma,\" was proposed in 51 ).\nAs we have reviewed, the AdS/CFT correspondence is a theoretical laboratory which\nallows one to study analytically an extreme\nexample of such a new state of matter: the\nthermal N = 4 SYM theory at very strong 't\nHooft coupling.\nIn a CFT, the pressure is related to the\nenergy density by p = 3e. Hence, the speed\nof sound satisfies c2s = dp/de = 13 . Recent\nlattice QCD calculations indicate that, while\nc2s is much lower for temperatures slightly\nabove Tc , it gets close to 1/3 for T \u2265 2Tc.42\nThus, for some range of temperatures starting around 2Tc , QCD may perhaps be treated\nas an approximately conformal, yet nonperturbative, gauge theory. This suggests\nthat AdS/CFT methods could indeed be useful in studying the physics of sQGP, and certainly gives strong motivation for continued\nexperimental and lattice research.\nLattice calculations indicate that the\ndeconfinement temperature Tc is around\n175 M eV , and the energy density is \u2248\n0.7 GeV /f m3 , around 6 times the nuclear energy density. RHIC has reached energy densities around 14 GeV /f m3 , corresponding to\nT \u2248 2Tc. Furthermore, in a few years, heavy\nion collisions at the LHC are expected to\nreach temperatures up to 5Tc . Thus, RHIC\nand LHC should provide a great deal of useful information about the conjectured quasiconformal temperature range of QCD.\n\n\fFor Publisher's use\n7\n\nString Duals of Confining\nTheories\n\nIt is possible to generalize the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence in such a way that the\nquark anti-quark potential is linear at large\ndistance.\nIn an effective 5-dimensional\napproach21 the necessary metric is\nds2 =\n\n\u0001\ndz 2\n+ a2 (z) \u2212 (dx0 )2 + (dxi )2 (27)\n2\nz\n\nand the space must end at a maximum value\nof z where the \"warp factor\" a2 (zmax ) is finite.b Placing widely separated probe quark\nand anti-quark near z = 0, we find that the\nstring connecting them bends toward larger\nz until it stabilizes at zmax where its tension\n2\n(zmax )\n. Thus, the\nis minimized at the value a 2\u03c0\u03b1\n\u2032\nconfining flux tube is described by a fundamental string placed at z = zmax parallel to\none of the xi -directions. This establishes a\nduality between \"emergent\" chromo-electric\nflux tubes and fundamental strings in certain\ncurved string theory backgrounds.\nSeveral 10-dimensional supergravity\nbackgrounds dual to confining gauge theories\nare now known, but they are somewhat more\ncomplicated than (27) in that the compact\ndirections are \"mixed\" with the 5-d (x\u03bc , z)\nspace. Witten56 constructed a background in\nthe universality class of non-supersymmetric\npure glue gauge theory. While in this background there is no asymptotic freedom in the\nUV, hence no dimensional transmutation, the\nbackground has served as a simple model of\nconfinement where many infrared observables\nhave been calculated using the classical supergravity. For example, the lightest glueball masses have been found from normalizable fluctuations around the supergravity\nsolution57 . Their spectrum is discrete, and\nresembles qualitatively the results of lattice\nsimulations in the pure glue theory.\nbA\n\nconfinement52\n\nsimple model of\nis obtained for\na(z) = 1/z in (27), i.e. the metric is a slice of AdS5\ncut off at zmax . Hadron spectra in models of this\ntype were studied in 53,54,55 .\n\nIntroduction of a minimal (N = 1)\nsupersymmetry facilitates construction of\ngauge/string dualities. As discussed earlier, a\nuseful method is to place a stack of D-branes\nat the tip of a six-dimensional cone, whose\nbase is Y5 . For N D3-branes, one finds the\nbackground AdS5 \u00d7 Y5 dual to a superconformal gauge theory. Furthermore, there exists\nan interesting way of breaking the conformal\ninvariance for spaces Y5 whose topology includes an S2 factor. At the tip of the cone\nover Y one may add M wrapped D5-branes\nto the N D3-branes. The gauge theory on\nsuch a combined stack is no longer conformal;\nit exhibits a novel pattern of quasi-periodic\nrenormalization group flow, called a duality\ncascade58,59 (for reviews, see 60,61 ).\nTo date, the most extensive study of\na theory of this type has been carried out\nfor a simple 6-d cone called the conifold,\nwhere one finds a N = 1 supersymmetric\nSU (N )\u00d7SU (N +M ) theory coupled to chiral\nsuperfields A1 , A2 in the (N, N + M) representation, and B1 , B2 in the (N, N + M) representation. In type IIB string theory, D5branes source the 7-form field strength from\nthe Ramond-Ramond sector, which is Hodge\ndual to the 3-form field strength. Therefore, the M wrapped D5-branes create M flux\nunits of this field strength through the 3-cycle\nin the conifold; this number is dual to the difference between the numbers of colors in the\ntwo gauge groups. An exact non-singular supergravity solution dual to this gauge theory,\nincorporating the 3-form and the 5-form RR field strengths, and their back-reaction on\nthe geometry, has been found59 . This backreaction creates a \"geometric transition\" to\nthe deformed conifold\n4\nX\n\nza2 = \u01eb2 ,\n\n(28)\n\na=1\n\nand introduces a \"warp factor\" so that the\nfull 10-d geometry has the form\n\u0001\nds2 = h\u22121/2 (\u03c4 ) \u2212(dx0 )2 + (dxi )2 +h1/2 (\u03c4 )ds\u030326 ,\n(29)\n\n\fFor Publisher's use\nwhere ds\u030326 is the Calabi-Yau metric of the deformed conifold, which is known explicitly.\nThe field theoretic interpretation of this\nsolution is unconventional.\nAfter a finite amount of RG flow, the SU (N +\nM ) group undergoes a Seiberg duality\ntransformation62. After this transformation,\nand an interchange of the two gauge groups,\nthe new gauge theory is SU (\u00d1 ) \u00d7 SU (\u00d1 +\nM ) with the same matter and superpotential, and with \u00d1 = N \u2212 M . The selfsimilar structure of the gauge theory under\nthe Seiberg duality is the crucial fact that allows this pattern to repeat many times. If\nN = (k + 1)M , where k is an integer, then\nthe duality cascade stops after k steps, and\nwe find a SU (M ) \u00d7 SU (2M ) gauge theory.\nThis IR gauge theory exhibits a multitude\nof interesting effects visible in the dual supergravity background. One of them is confinement, which follows from the fact that\nthe warp factor h is finite and non-vanishing\nat the smallest radial coordinate, \u03c4 = 0,\nwhich roughly corresponds to z = zmax in\nan effective 5-d approach (27). This implies\nthat the quark anti-quark potential grows linearly at large distances. Other notable IR effects are chiral symmetry breaking, and the\nGoldstone mechanism63 . Particularly interesting is the appearance of an entire \"baryonic branch\" of the moduli space in the gauge\ntheory, whose existence has been recently\ndemonstrated also in the dual supergravity\nlanguage64.\nBesides providing various new insights\ninto the IR physics of confining gauge theories, the availability of their string duals enables one to study Deep-Inelastic and hadronhadron scattering in this new language52 .\n8\n\nSummary\n\nThroughout\nits\nhistory, string theory has been intertwined\nwith the theory of strong interactions. The\nAdS/CFT correspondence3,4,5 succeeded in\n\nmaking precise connections between conformal 4-dimensional gauge theories and superstring theories in 10 dimensions. This duality\nleads to a multitude of dynamical predictions\nabout strongly coupled gauge theories. When\nextended to theories at finite temperature, it\nserves as a theoretical laboratory for studying\na novel state of matter: a gluonic plasma at\nvery strong coupling. This appears to have\nsurprising connections to the new state of\nmatter, sQGP, observed at RHIC6 .\nExtensions of the AdS/CFT correspondence to confining gauge theories provide\nnew geometrical viewpoints on such important phenomena as chiral symmetry breaking\nand dimensional transmutation. They allow\nfor studying meson and glueball spectra, and\nhigh-energy scattering, in model gauge theories.\nThis recent progress offers new tantalizing hopes that an analytic approximation to\nQCD will be achieved along this route, at\nleast for a large number of colors. But there\nis much work that remains to be done if this\nhope is to become reality: understanding the\nstring duals of weakly coupled gauge theories\nremains an important open problem.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI am grateful to the organizers of the 2005\nLepton-Photon Symposium in Uppsala for\ngiving me an opportunity to present this\ntalk in a pleasant and stimulating environment.
