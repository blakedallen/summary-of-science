We indicate how the measurement problem and the emergence of the macroscopic sub-regime can be understood in this framework.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn preceding work we have started to develop a radically discrete mathematical\nand physical framework aimed at reconstructing, beginning at the Planck scale\nand working \"bottom-up\" (so to speak), our present day continuum physics and\ncorresponding mathematics (cf. [1] to [5]). Our main intention is it however to\nderive both quantum theory and general relativity, i.e. gravitation (and in the\nlast consequence (semi)classical space-time), as emergent and low energy effective\ntheories by a coarse graining process from a more primordial discrete substratum.\nWhile papers [1] to [4] deal mostly with the development of the necessary\nmathematical and physical concepts and tools (typically discrete protoforms of\ntheir continuum counterparts), some concrete steps towards a realisation of the\nmore ambitious latter goal were taken in paper [5] as far as the emergence and\nreconstruction of a protoform of continuum space-time as, what we call, an order\nparameter manifold is concerned. By this we mean an extended coarse-grained\nsuperstructure displaying a certain collective order on a larger and smoother\nscale. As in the case of ordinary order parameters in, say, condensed matter\nphysics, this emergence of order is usually the result of a phase transition and\nis accompanied by a shrinking of microscopic phase space being occupied by the\nsystem. Whereas this programme is far from being completed, its core result (or\nrather: hypothesis, as not every step in the corresponding analysis is, up to now,\nrigorously proved) can be summarized as follows.\nThe physical vacuum or (semiclassical) space-time has to be considered on\na certain level of resolution as a two-story structure. It consists of a relatively\nsmooth \"surface layer\" formed by an intricate web of overlaping lumps (the physical points) and representing the quasi-continuous medium we experience as ordinary space-time. Beneath this surface there exists a more irregular and wildly\nfluctuating \"underworld\" of a distinctly discrete and stochastic nature (stochastic\ncompared to our ordinary level of resolution; at the very bottom the underlying\ndynamics may well be deterministic!). Its perhaps most characteristic feature is a\npeculiar non-local dynamical behavior observed in [5] and further analyzed below\nas it plays a decisive role in the understanding of quantum theory. Each of these\ntwo stories has its own physical or dynamical distance function or metric and,\ntypically, there will exist a certain amount of direct interactions or exchange of\ninformation in this mentioned underground between regions (or lumps) lying a\ncertain distance apart with respect to the distance concept holding sway in the\ncoarse grained surface structure (i.e. our classical space-time).\nOur whole approach is technically based on what we call a cellular network,\ndubbed QX for short (\"quantum space\"), as the most primordial substratum in\nour framework. This network is assumed to have been evolved in the distant past\n(\"big bang\") from a certain chaotic initial phase denoted by QX0 (and which is\ncharacterized, among other things, by the complete absence of stable patterns)\nthrough a regime of geometric change (called a geometric phase transition zone)\n1\n\n\finto a new phase QX/ST . This latter phase represents the above described two\nstory superstructure, i.e. the underlying primordial network superposed by a\ncoarser network consisting of a web of lumps, that is, certain subgraphs with a\nparticularly dense internal connectivity among the respective nodes (and playing\nthe role of the \"physical points\"). These physical points are considered to be\nthe constituents of the relatively smooth surface structure, ST . This new phase,\nQX/ST , is the epoch our universe is roaming in since the moment when spacetime emerged from this mentioned underground as an approximately separate\nentity.\nIt is a peculiar feature of this kind of geometric phase transition (described in\nmuch more detail in [5]) that it equips the mentioned surface- or superstructure\nof lumps with a so-called Nahwirkungsprinzip, while on a finer level of resolution\nthere remain a lot of additional non-local interactions among distant lumps of,\nhowever, a more subtle nature. We will argue in the following that this almost\nhidden non-local web of exchange of information, which arises quite naturally\nin our approach, plays a decisive role in the formation of quantum theory as an\neffective continuum theory incorporating certain non-local gross features of the\ndepth structure of space-time (about such a possibility was already speculated in\n[6] \u2013 and possibly also elsewhere \u2013 as a way out of the so-called EPR-paradoxon).\nIt goes without saying that, given the complexity of the task and the long\nand entangled history of the subject, such things cannot simply be proved in a\nrigorous sense of the word as there does not even exist a universally accepted\nframework from which to start, not even in ordinary (non)orthodox quantum\ntheory. By necessity our approach has to be, at least in this preparatory stage,\nspeculative to some extent and has to be based on a more or less loose (or strong,\ndepending on the point of view) web of arguments mixed with a certain amount\nof \"educated guesswork\".\nFurthermore, as the interpretation or epistemology of quantum theory has\nsuch a long and involved history of its own we have to refrain from recapitulating\ntoo much of this nightmarish and mind boggling subject. That is, lack of space\nprevents us from giving full credit to many researchers in this field. This would\nafford a full monograph and would give the paper a perhaps too \"philosophical\"\ntouch. We therefore concentrate in the rest of this introductory section on mentioning and quoting in loose order those approaches and points of view which\nappear to be similar (at least to some extent) in spirit to our own working philosophy and make some comments and anotations. In the next section we discuss\ntwo approaches in slightly more detail as they are related a little bit closer to our\nown one in several technical respects.\nWe begin this brief historical part with two general remarks by von Weizs\u00e4cker\n([7], similar ideas were also entertained by Wheeler, see e.g. [8]) which strike the\nkey of our paper.\n. . . space-time is not the background but a surface aspect of reality . . .\n\n2\n\n\fIt is extremely improbable that this reality (i.e. quantum reality) will be\ndescribable as consisting of events which are localized in space and time.\nThe translocal phase relations are \"surplus information\" not lack of information. Quantum theory knows more, not less, than local classical physics.\n\nA well known critic of the orthodox Copenhagen interpretation was Einstein.\nHere are some illuminating utterances which are in our view very much to the\npoint. More about his original scientific attitude can be found in the beautiful\nessay of Stachel in [9] or [10]\nIt is . . . to be expected that behind quantum mechanics there lies a lawfulness and a description that refer to the individual system. That it is not\nattainable within the bounds or concepts taken from classical mechanics is\nclear.\nI do not at all doubt that the contemporary quantum theory (more exactly\n\"quantum mechanics\") is the most complete theory compatible with experience, as long as one bases the description on the concepts of material\npoint and potential energy as fundamental concepts.\n\n(The latter remark is taken from [10]). We want to stress the fundamental importance of the underlying insight being conveyed in these remarks. It is a crucial\nobservation that quantum mechanics (as we know it) happens to be just the\ndescription of the \"quantum world\" if one starts from the core concepts of classical mechanics like e.g. position, momentum etc. Following this line one may\nget a very specific and biased class of observables while excluding other possible elementary concepts. This contextual and historical dependence of theories,\nframeworks and whole working philosophies is frequently overlooked or, at least,\nnot sufficiently appreciated. The problems we still have with quantum theory\nmay just result from a too selective choice we have made in the past.\nIn other words, while quantum theory has made the first steps away from the\nmechanistic particle picture, it has still retained many of its conceptual ingredients and has molded it into the hybrid of the so-called wave-particle duality. A\nsimilar point of view was hold by e.g. Schr\u00f6dinger (see his beautiful and extensive\nbiography, [12]).\nA further point worth of mentioning is Einsteins open attitude towards the\ndiscrete and the continuum. Many quotations can again be found in ([9] p.27ff).\nAnother source (mentioned already in [5]) is his commentary in [11] on the contribution of Menger (geometry of lumps and statistical metrical space).\nHaeretic views were also hold by Dirac, a fact which is perhaps not so widely\nknown (cf. e.g. his biography, [13] p.201ff). He in fact tried for many years\nto revive a modern aether concept as a common receptacle for all the physical\nprocesses (see also [14]). Similar ideas were uttered by Bell ([15]) or T.D.Lee\n([16]), to mention a few.\n3\n\n\fThe arguments for the absence of such an underlying substrate are in our view\nfar from being convincing and are rather typical for what is called a paradigm,\ni.e. an adopted working philosophy which, when accepted, tends to become very\nrigid and constellates and frames our whole attitude towards the occurring phenomena and their codification in the form of theoretical concepts. We think that\nthis paradigm is responsible to some extent for the interpretational difficulties\nand seemingly paradoxical language of orthodox quantum mechanics. We are\nconvinced that quantum mechanics would become considerably less paradoxical\nif we were prepared to realize the ubiquituous interference phenomena (which are\nin fact the pivotal point of quantum theory) and the complex structure as part\nof the quantum information conveyed by extended excitation patterns roaming\nthis largely hidden \"underground\".\nOne of the consequences of taking the possibility of such a hidden and subtly\norganized substructure not taking into account and regarding, instead of that,\nspace-time as the primordial receptacle is the attitude to consider e.g. wave functions and their seeming breakdown as mere subjective artifacts. This becomes\nparticularly apparent in the usual discussion of the double slit experiment. In our\nview it is difficult to deny that there is \"something\" passing \"through\" both slits\nin the undisturbed situation in each individual experiment. But this \"something\"\ncannot be so easily detected as long as the intricate substructure of space-time\nis not realized.\nIt is no question that the old (mechanical) aether concept is almost empty,\nbut its emptyness resulted from another even older paradigmatic preoccupation\nof that time, i.e. the fiction of an empty, a priori and independently existing\ngeometric background space which is then permeated by some medium called\naether. One should rather regard (background) space-time as only a part of an\nunderlying more complex substrate in the way we have indicated above.\nThis whole bundle of problems and ideas belongs in fact to a much wider topic,\nwhich originated already with Leibniz and Mach (see e.g. the lively debate in\n[17]) and has been lucidly clarified by Einstein. It is the almost universal topic of\nthe role of so-called ideal elements in scientific theories. As their role in quantum\ntheory will be a central theme of our paper we give it a closer inspection in the\nnext section and close the introduction with some (as we think) deep remarks\nand reservations uttered by Scrooge in [18] to which we fully subscribe.\nWave functions are real for the same reason that quarks and symmetries\nare . . . Any system is in a definite state whether any humans are observing\nit or not; the state is not described by a position or a momentum but by\na wave function.\nIt seems to me that none of this forces us to stop thinking of the wave\nfunctions as real, it just behaves in ways that we are not used to, including\ninstantaneous changes.\n(Weinbergs own utterance on p.143): The positivist concentration on ob-\n\n4\n\n\fservables like particle positions and momenta has stood in the way of a\nrealist interpretation of quantum mechanics in which the wave function is\nthe representation of physical reality.\n\nThe following sections, 2 to 4, are of a preparatory nature, that is, they provide\nthe necessary background, motivations and concepts, thus paving the ground for\nthe central sections, 5 and 6, of the paper in which quantum theory is derived as\na low-energy effective theory of a more primordial theory, living on the Planck\nscale. In a short aside we speculate about the possibility that this fundamental\ntheory may also underly string theory (near the end of section 5). In section 7\nwe briefly indicate in what directions our appoach has to be further developed\nin order to address the so-called measurement problem and/or the emergence of\nmacroscopic behavior.\n\n2\n\nThe Description of our own Working Philosophy\n\nIn this section we want to discuss the pieces of our own working philosophy in\nmore detail and relate it to two other approaches presented in the more recent\npast, which seem to be developed in a similar spirit. The one of the mentioned\napproaches is expounded in two longer papers by Smolin ([19],[20]) and stems\nfrom the period before he embarked on the loop quantum gravity program. The\nother is the work of 't Hooft about a presumed cellular automaton substrate\nunderlying quantum theory (see [21] to [23]). While these two frameworks differ\nin several respects from each other, each of them shares, on the other side, a\nbundle of ideas with a certain particular strand in our own approach.\n\n2.1\n\nA short Review of Smolin's Ideas, the Role of Ideal\nElements and our own Point of View\n\nIn this subsection we concentrate mainly on the epistemological and foundational\naspects of Smolin's work as they are of particular importance for the understanding of the (sub)structure of quantum theory. The more technical aspects and the\nconcrete implementation are postponed to the following sections. The greater\npart of the epistemological ideas can be found in [19].\nCentral in this respect is the notion and role of ideal elements in physical\nmodel theories. Smolin argues that practically all our theories contain - by necessity - so-called ideal elements as they typically deal only with a portion of our\nuniverse. He describes them as absolute or background structures which are not\nthemselves determined by solving any dynamical equations or, put differently, elements of the mathematical structure whose interpretation requires the existence\nof things outside of the dynamical system described by the theory. He argues\n5\n\n\fthat both Mach's Princicple and the quantum mechanical measurement problem\nare cases in point, both of which are crucial parts of the even greater problem of\nconstructing a sensible quantum cosmology. To give another but related definition, we can say with Einstein that something that acts but is not acted upon\nserves as an ideal element like e.g. inertial systems in special relativity (cf. [24]).\nThe reason why this theme is so carefully discussed by Smolin is the necessity\nto formulate a theory of quantum gravity that does not depend on an absolute\nbackground space. This is the place where the Machian Philosophy comes into\nthe play in form of a sceptical attitude towards the existence of space-time as\na metaphysical and a priori substratum. The reader who is interested in the\nactual content of this (a little bit poetic) principle should consult [17] or e.g.\n[25]. Another illuminating characterisation, stemming from Westpfahl ([27]), is\nquoted in [26].\n. . . all tendencies which try to reduce all the phenomena which cannot be\ndescribed by laws of nature (viz. field equations) to cosmological causes\n\nAs our primary concern in this paper is the creation of an underlying more primordial theory which contains ordinary quantum theory as an effective and derived\nstochastic theory, we will henceforth concentrate more on the role of ideal elements in quantum theory. Perhaps a little bit surprisingly, we will show later\nthat in a certain way such a Machian strategy, i.e. explaining seemingly local\nfeatures of a theory by a nonlocal influence of the (distant) environment, will also\nwork in quantum theory.\nNow, what are the ideal elements in quantum theory? Deviating slightly\nfrom the analysis of Smolin we concentrate at the moment not so much on the\ninfameous measurement problem but on another (in our view) central structural\nelement of quantum theory, i.e. the superposition principle together with the\ngenuine complex structure of the theory.\nConjecture 2.1 (Ideal Elements in Quantum Theory)\n1. In a similar sense as Smolin did, we conjecture that the complex Hilbert\nspace structure of ordinary quantum theory (and in particular the superposition principle) are playing the role of ideal elements in quantum theory.\nThey encode in a local way a nonlocal stochastic interaction between the\nlumps of the surface structure ST .\n2. Furthermore we claim that a good deal of the observed local quantum fluctuations and randomness has its origin in the fact that ordinary quantum\ntheory is, by necessity, that is, by its very definition, a theory of only a small\nportion of the universe, with this portion being open to permanent nonlocal\ninteraction with the (distant) regions of the quantum environment.\n\n6\n\n\f3. Put differently, as in the Machian concept of inertia, we assume that the\nmentioned ideal structural elements of quantum theory encode in a, on the\nsurface, local way nonlocal effects which originate on a more primordiallevel\nand which make the local version of the theory, formulated in macroscopic\nspace-time, a stochastic one. The deeper reason for this is that this local\nformulation describes (while being unaware of it) a, in some sense, open\nsystem.\nThe last remark leads to another central theme of a realistic approach towards\nquantum theory, viz. the nature and origin of statistics in the quantum realm.\nSmolin remarks in [20] by referring to various recent observations in quantum\ncosmology (e.g. [28]) that there seems to be no local coordinate invariant distinction between real statistical fluctuations (in the \"ordinary\" sense) and virtual\nquantum fluctuations. The lesson we learned from Einstein is then the following.\nObservation 2.2 If the distinction of two phenomena depends on the system of\nreference then these, superficially different, phenomena are actually of the same\nkin.\nConsequently our program can be described as follows.\nProgramme 2.3 Find an underlying more primordial model theory in which\nvirtual quantum fluctuations are ordinary statistical fluctuations.\nThis is now the point where the various strategies bifurcate from each other.\nIn [20] Smolin chose to further develop the Nelson progamme of stochastic (quantum) mechanics, which is based on the picture of a particle moving in a quasibrownian environment with, however, a quite peculiar diffusion behavior not observed in the classical regime (as to this programme see e.g. [29] or [30]). Smolin\nthen embeds the system in a background gravitational field and argues that this\nstrategy shows that and how the Hilbert space framework has to be transcended.\nAt the end of the paper he discusses certain models dealing with nonlocal hidden\nvariables.\nWe should say that this was, at least to some extent, a strategy we also persued in earlier times. In [31] we argued for example that the Nelson approach has\nto be developed further in the direction of nonmarkovian mechanics and made\nsome tentative steps along these lines. Our main argument was that the fluctuating but passive background in the Nelson-approach (viz. an ideal element par\nexcellence) has to become dynamical due to the (back)reaction of the randomly\nmoving quantum particle, which, in our view, can no longer be neglected in the\nquantum regime. If one now averages over this dynamical background one would\nget an evolution equation for the particle itself which contains now a memory\nkernel (as the averaging process will collect retardation effects), i.e. which becomes nonmarkovian. The technical implementation of this programme, however,\n7\n\n\fturned out to be extraordinarily ambitious and we hesitated at that time to push\nthe work beyond the preprint status.\nWhat all these and related approaches are having in common is that they\nstick to a particle concept as fundamental building block, i.e. it is assumed that\nthere exists a discrete entity which moves in a fluctuating background. This is,\nhowever, exactly the concept we choose to abandon in our more recent approach\nin which quantum objects are, on the contrary, assumed to be extended excitation\npatterns roaming our two story network environment but carrying certain discrete\nparticle properties which are observed in suitable measurement set-ups. On the\nother hand, it may well be that the older ansatz turns out to be a certain useful\napproximation to this more complex picture.\n\n2.2\n\n't Hooft's Framework plus some Comments\n\nThe starting point for 't Hooft is a little bit different from the preceding approach.\nHis emphasis lies on the discreteness of physics at the Planck scale and is thus\nrelated to the other strand of ideas on which our own framework is based. It is\nhis aim to derive quantum behavior on a large scale (i.e. also by a kind of coarse\ngraining) from suitable deterministic cellular automaton laws holding sway on a\nmore primordial scale (see [21] to [23]). There exist earlier related ideas scattered\nin the literature which were inspired by the concept of cellular automata (e.g. [32]\nor [33]). In his most recent contribution ([23]) he argues that certain versions\nof hidden variable theories must be revived in the face of problems in quantum\ngravity and that space, time and matter all have to be discrete at bottom.\nAnother point he rightly emphasizes is that (obviously) the primordial degrees\nof freedom are not describing electrons or any other particles, but microscopic\nvariables at scales comparable to the Planck scale. This is exactly in line with\nwhat we said above and with our own framework. We will readdress this particular aspect in the next subsection under the catchword of the problem of scales.\nOf particular relevance for our enterprise is the following somewhat related\nargument against the many critics of such deterministic approaches in the quantum realm. 't Hofft reasons that quantum theory provides a completely adequate\nframework on its natural scale of resolution and that there is no chance to replace\nit on this scale by some classical or deterministic model theory. But it may well\nbe that a model theory being deterministic on the Planck scale generates the statistical quantum laws via coarse graining on their natural scale, thus invalidating\nthe consequences of, say, the Bell inequalities.\nWhile we are very sympathetic with this programme we would like to comment\non some differences as compared to our own framework. The main difference, we\nthink, is that we do not base our analysis on a rigid a priori fixed lattice structure\nbut, instead of that, regard the geometric wiring diagram underlying the cellular\nnetwork as a full fledged dynamical system of its own which interacts with the\nnode states (which, on the other side, are the only variables in a cellular au8\n\n\ftomaton). Thus geometry, dimension,metrical properties, near- and far-order all\nbecome dynamical collective quantities which are assumed to coevolve. The underlying philosphy is of course that ultimately both quantum theory and gravity\nemerge as two seemingly different but in fact related large scale aspects of one\nand the same underlying theory.\nAnother important aspect of our programme is that we will show in the following that quantum theory encodes in a at first glance local way on its own natural\nscale hidden nonlocal long-range interactions among the really microscopic degrees of freedom, living on a more primordial level.\n\n2.3\n\nThe Problem of Scales\n\nIt is frequently argued that the attempt to relate e.g. quantum physics on its\npresently accessible middle energy scales to some underlying and largely hidden\nprimordial theory, living on, say, the Planck scale, is virtually impossible due\nto the huge difference in orders of magnitude between the two regimes. This is\ncalled the problem of scales. There is certainly more than a grain of truth in this\ncriticism but we think one can turn this seeming difficulty into an advantage by\npursuing the following strategy.\nAs in the physics of the critical point (in, say, statistical mechanics or lattice\nquantum field theory), any continuum theory which is nontrivial, that is, which\nhas correlations and patterns extending over non-zero scales, must necessarily be\nin a critical or at least near-critical state on the microscopic scale, as all finite\nlength scales will shrink to zero in the continuum limit. That is, it must have\nvery long range correlations on that scale, which is typically only the case near\nor at the critical point.\nBy the same token, to a given continuum theory will belong a whole universality class of microscopic theories which lead to the same macroscopic consequences. Applied to e.g. general relativity such a point of view is expressed\nin [34]. A perhaps even more radical opinion is expressed in [35] (there are in\nfact quite a few other interesting ideas to be found in this book), running under\nthe catchword random dynamics. The central hypothesis is that the structure\nof the theories on the low- or middle-energy side of the energy spectrum is to a\nlarge extent independent of the form of the hypothesized fundamental theories\non the ultra-high energy side and that the structure of the former ones is rather\na consequence of the way how the coarse graining is performed.\nThis point of view is partly corroborated by the observations we make below\nwhen we attempt to derive quantum theory from our network model. On the other\nside this does not mean (at least in our view) that a particular fundamental theory\ndoes not exist or that we shall be unable to discriminate between different model\ntheories in the future (note that a similar standpoint could have been adopted\nwith respect to quantum theory as the underlying theory of classical mechanics).\nThe correct conclusion to draw is that it is not reasonable (in the beginning) to\n9\n\n\fconcentrate too much on certain (possibly wrong or unimportant) microscopic\ndetails but better have the gross features right. That is, the real task may rather\nconsist of extracting the possibly few crucial characteristics which the primordial\ntheory must contain and which, in the end, survive the coarse graining limit.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nA brief R\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the Properties of the TwoStory Network Substratum\nSome General Remarks\n\nAs the technical details and underlying working philosophy can to a large part\nbe found in refs. [1] to [5] with special emphasis on [5], we will be very brief.\nWe emulate the underlying substratum of our world, or, more specifically, of our\nspace-time (quantum) vacuum (containing however in addition all the existing\nquantum and macro objects as extended excitation patterns!) by what we call a\ncellular network.\nThis discrete structure consists of elementary nodes, ni , which interact (or\nexchange information) with each other via bonds, bik , playing the role of (in this\ncontext) not further reducible (abstract) elements. The possible internal structure\nof the nodes (modules) or bonds (interaction chanels) is emulated by discrete\ninternal state spaces carried by the nodes/bonds. The node set is assumed to be\nlarge but finite or countable. The bond bik is assumed to connect the nodes ni , nk .\nThe internal states of the nodes/bonds are denoted by si , Jik respectively. As our\nphilosophy is, to generate complex behavior out of simple models we, typically,\nmake simple choices for them, one being e.g.\nsi \u2208 q * Z ,\n\nJik \u2208 {\u22121, 0, +1}\n\n(1)\n\nwith q an elementary quantum of information.\nAs in our approach the bond states are dynamical degrees of freedom which,\na fortiori, can be switched off or on, the wiring, that is the pure geometry of the\nnetwork is also an emergent, dynamical property and is not given in advance.\nConsequently the nodes, bonds are typically not ordered in a more or less regular\narray, a lattice say, with a fixed nea-/far-order. This implies that geometry will\nbecome to some extent a relational (Machian) concept and is no longer an ideal\nelement (cf. the discussion in sect. 2).\nOn the other side, as in cellular automata, the node and bond states are\nupdated (for convenience) in discrete clock time steps, t = z * \u03c4 , z \u2208 Z and \u03c4\nbeing an elementary clock time interval. This updating is given by some local\ndynamical law (examples given below). In this context local means that the\nnode/bond states are changed at each clock time step according to a prescription\nwith input the overall state of a certain neighborhood (in some topology) of the\n10\n\n\fnode/bond under discussion. We want however to emphasize that t is not to\nbe confounded with some physical time, which, for its part, is also considered to\nbe an emergent coarse grained quantity. The well known problem of time is, for\nthe time being, not treated in detail in the following, as it is a big problem of\nits own, needing a careful and separate analysis of its own (see however [36] or\n[37]). That is, at the moment the above clock time is neither considered to be\ndynamical nor observer dependent. There is however a brief discussion of the\npresumed emergence of a new primordial time scale which sets the scale for the\nregime where quantum fluctuations hold sway (see below).\nIn [5] we gave examples of local dynamical laws which, we presume, are capable of encoding the kind of geometric unfolding we are expecting. An important\ningredient is what we call a hysteresis dynamics, that is, the bonds, or more\nproperly the interactions Jik , are switched off under appropriate conditions of\nthe local network environment. An example of such a local law is the following:\nDefinition 3.1 (Example of a Local Law) At each clock time step a certain\nquantum q is exchanged between, say, the nodes ni , nk , connected by the bond bik\nsuch that\nX\nsi (t + \u03c4 ) \u2212 si (t) = q *\nJki (t)\n(2)\nk\n\n(i.e. if Jki = +1 a quantum q flows from nk to ni etc.)\nThe second part of the law describes the back reaction on the bonds (and is,\ntypically, more subtle). This is the place where the so-called hysteresis interval\nenters the stage. We assume the existence of two critical parameters 0 \u2264 \u03bb1 \u2264 \u03bb2\nwith:\nJik (t + \u03c4 ) = 0 if\n\n|si (t) \u2212 sk (t)| =: |sik (t)| > \u03bb2\n\nJik (t + \u03c4 ) = \u00b11\n\nif\n\n0 < \u00b1sik (t) < \u03bb1\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwith the special proviso that\nJik (t + \u03c4 ) = Jik (t) if\n\nsik (t) = 0\n\n(5)\n\n\u001a\n\nif \u03bb1 \u2264 \u00b1sik (t) \u2264 \u03bb2\n\n(6)\n\nOn the other side\nJik (t + \u03c4 ) =\n\n\u00b11\n0\n\nJik (t) 6= 0\nJik (t) = 0\n\nIn other words, bonds are switched off if local spatial charge fluctuations are too\nlarge, switched on again if they are too small, their orientation following the sign\nof local charge differences, or remain inactive.\n11\n\n\fRemark: Another interesting law arises if one exchanges the role of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2\nin the above law, that is, bonds are switched off if the local node fluctuations\nare too small and are switched on again if they exceed \u03bb2 . We emulated all\nthese laws on a computer and studied a lot of network properties. The latter law\nhas the peculiar feature that it turned out to have very short transients in the\nsimulations, i.e. it reaches an attractor in a very short clock time. Furthermore\nthis attractor turned out to be very regular, that is, it had a very short period\nof typically six, the whole network returned in a previous state after only six\nclock time steps, which is quite remarkable, given the seeming complexity of the\nevolution and the huge phase space ([38]).\nSome characteristic features of these class of laws are the following.\nObservation 3.2 (Gauge Invariance)\n1. The dynamics depends only on the local charge differences, si \u2212 sk and\nnowhere on the absolute values si itself, i.e. it is to some extent relational.\nP\n2. The total charge, Q := ni si , is conserved under the evolution. One could\ne.g. choose a boundary condition like Q = 0, which may be considered as a\nkind of gauge fixing.\nThe following point we consider to be of central importance, irrepective of the\nconcrete network law under discussion.\nObservation 3.3 We expect that really interesting fundamental laws display the\nfollowing generic patterns. They typically consist of more or less two parts, encoding the interaction of two primordial substructures, described a little bit sloppily\nby the catchwords geometry and matter.\n1. geometry acting on matter\n2. matter acting on geometry\nUsually the first part of the dynamical law seems to be relatively simple and transparent, while the second part is typically much more involved.\nRemark: Note that these criteria are fulfilled by our above example, where the\nfirst part is more or less a conservation law. The geometric structure is the wiring\nof the network, i.e. the global bond state. A classical case in point is general\nrelativity, where the first part consists of the geodesic motion of matter, the latter\npart of the Einstein equations. We will later show that even quantum theory is\nalready of this type if understood or looked upon in a certain (new?) way.\nIn [5] we chose to concentrate on the geometric structure of the network,\nthus neglecting most of the details of the microscopic network state and the\n12\n\n\fdynamics. In the corresponding reduced graphical representation a bond, bik\nwas drawn between the nodes ni , nk in the time-dependent graph, G(V, E(t)),\niff the bond-state, Jik (t), was different from zero (V, E the set of nodes, edges\n(bonds) respectively). In a next step these graphs were considered as members\nof a certain probability space, G(n, p), of random graphs over n nodes and with\nthe edge probability 0 \u2264 p \u2264 1.\nRemark 3.4 One can as well choose a slightly higher resolution by keeping trace\nof the sign of the bond-interaction, that is Jik = +/ \u2212 1, and identify Jik = +1\nwith a directed bond, dik , pointing from ni to nk or vice versa for Jik = \u22121. This\nwould lead to a so-called directed graph.\nIn [5] we were particularly interested in certain subgraphs of a typical random\ngraph taken from G(n, p), their size, number, degree of overlap and entanglement.\nThese particular subgraphs are called cliques in graph theory and are (in a technical sense) maximal complete subgraphs or subsimplices, that is, all the pairs\nof nodes belonging to a clique are connected by a bond and the cliques are the\nmaximal elements in the respective chains of subsimplices (ordered by inclusion).\nIn more physical terms we also called them lumps or physical points.\nFor later purposes we note that a graph carries a natural metric:\nDefinition 3.5 The (natural) distance, d(ni , nk ), between two nodes, ni , nk , is\nthe length of a minimal path (a geodesic) connecting them, its length given by the\nnumber of bonds of the path. This distance defines a metric on G (d := \u221e if the\nnodes are lying in different components).\nRemark: There are other interesting notions of distance one can envisage on a\ngraph. One is studied in [3] and is related to similar concepts in non-commutative\ngeometry. Another is discussed at the end of [19].\n\n3.2\n\nThe Web of Lumps\n\nWe argued in [5] that what we experience as (quasi)classical space-time and\n(on a higher resolution) as quantum vacuum, consists roughly of two or rather\nthree regimes. At the very bottom we have the level of the primordial network with its corresponding primordial length- and (clock) time scales, correlation lengths/times etc. On the next level we have the web of lumps or physical\npoints, i.e. the web of overlapping cliques. this level defines a new group of corresponding (length) scales, as it is usually the case if a new phase emerges. We\nconjecture that these emerging scales are the infameous Planck-units, e.g. lP , tP\netc. On the macroscopic surface level, which is the regime directly accessible to\nus, the internal structure of the physical points is no longer visible, we observe a\n(quasi) continuum as background space which, on a slightly finer scale, is roamed\nby quantum fluctuations, representing the residual low-energy effects of what is\nhappening on the deeper levels.\n13\n\n\fIn [5] we made a relatively detailed analysis of this web of lumps within the\nframework of random graphs. We calculated the typical size of these lumps, their\nnumber, mutual overlap, expected size of the infinitesimal neighborhood of a\ntypical lump etc. On the other side, some problems remained open for which we\nhave, at the moment, only partial answers (which is however no wonder, given\nthe enormous complexity of the behavior of the undrlying network). Note that in\nthe random graph approach we concentrated solely on the wiring diagram of the\nnetwork and studied its properties in a purely statistical way. It became apparent\nthat in order to follow its dynamical evolution in more detail, something like a\nnon-equilibrium statitical mechanics for such systems is called for. Furthermore,\nthe pure random graph picture is possibly (or rather: probably) not sufficient to\nexplain every aspect of the unfolding process of the network towards the expected\nnew phase, QX/ST . This, however, has to be expected since we have learned that\nthe unfolding towards a level both of higher order and diversity may need some\nfine-tuning and is not the expected to be the ordinary situation (a catchword\nbeing \"complexity at the edge of chaos\"; see[39] to [41]).\nAs far as the derivation of quantum theory as an effective theory is concerned\nwe therefore will assume that our network has made a transition into this new\nphase, QX/ST , consisting, on a limit scale of magnification, of a web of lumps,\nfluctuating around some stabel positions and/or average shape with their degree\nof overlap and their mutual (macroscopic) distance also fluctuating around some\naverage value. Some aspects of this picture are then very reminiscent of model\nsystems studied in the past (investigations initiated by Menger et al; see e.g. [42]\nand further references given there). We sum up what we have said so far in the\nfollowing brief r\u00e9sum\u00e9e. (Note that in the following, in contrast to [5], we denote\nlumps or physical points by Pi for notational convenience).\nObservation 3.6 (The Two-Story Concept of QX/ST)\n1. Given a network or graph, G, of the above kind, we can construct its associated clique graph CG (vertices being the lumps or cliques, the bonds given by\noverlap of cliques, see [5]), and thus establish the two story concept, mentioned already in the introduction. We hence have two kinds of distances\nand metric (causal) relations in the network, the one defined by the original\nnode distance in G, the other by the distance between lumps (defined by\noverlap) in CG .\n2. It is important that two lumps, P1 , P2 , which are some distance apart in CG ,\nmay nevertheless be connected by a certain (possibly substantial) number of\ninterbonds or short paths, extending from nodes in P1 to nodes in P2 (see\nthe construction of the cliques described in the preceding sections).\n3. That is, there may exist two types of information transport or correlation\nbeing exchanged in the network. A relatively coherent (and presumably\n14\n\n\fquasi-classical) one, exchanged among the lumps, obeying a so-called Nahwirkungsprinzip and a more stochastic and less organized one (of quantum\nnature) between individual groups of nodes lying in lumps, which may be\na certain distance apart, and which, nevertheless, can be almost instantaneous.\nAs we are in the following mainly concerned with the information flow between\nthe various lumps, Pi , making up the orderparameter manifold, ST , we develop\nbelow a couple of useful concepts and tools which are adapted this new emergent\nlevel of description. Particularly impotant for the near-/far-order in ST (which\nis related to its causal structure) are the various degrees of connectedness among\nthe physical points, Pi . The following abbreviation is useful. For ni , nk (not\nbeing) connected by a bond we write\nni \u223c nk\n\n(ni 6\u223c nk )\n\n(7)\n\nWe then have\nObservation 3.7 From the definition of the cliques it follows\n1. ni 6\u223c nk implies that they are lying in different P\u03bd 's.\n2. P\u03bd , P\u03bc are disjoint, i.e. P\u03bd \u2229 P\u03bc = \u2205 iff\n\u2200n\u03bd \u2208 P\u03bd \u2203 n\u03bc \u2208 P\u03bc with n\u03bd 6\u223c n\u03bc or vice versa\n\n(8)\n\nThis shows that it may well be that P\u03bd \u2229 P\u03bc = \u2205 while the two lumps have still a\nlot of interbonds, i.e. bonds connecting the one with the other. The guiding idea\nis however that the respective vertesx sets VP\u03bd and VP\u03bc , as a whole, will typically\nbe weaker entangled with each other than the nodes within P\u03bd or P\u03bc when the\nunfolding process is fully developed.\nObservation/Definition 3.8 With respect to the above clique graph or web of\nlumps we can speak of an\n1. interior bond of a given P\u03bd , i.e:\nbik with ni , nk \u2208 P\u03bd\n\n(9)\n\n2. exterior bond with respect to a given P\u03bd , i.e:\nbik with ni , nk \u2208\n/ P\u03bd\n\n(10)\n\nbik with ni \u2208 P\u03bd , nk \u2208 P\u03bc , \u03bd 6= \u03bc\n\n(11)\n\n3. an interbond, i.e:\n\n15\n\n\f4. a common bond of P\u03bd ,P\u03bc if bik is an interior bond both of P\u03bd and P\u03bc .\n5. a true interbond bik if for \u03bd 6= \u03bc:\nni \u2208 P\u03bd , nk \u2208 P\u03bc , nk \u2208\n/ P\u03bd\n\n(12)\n\n6. We then have the relation for given P\u03bd , P\u03bc :\n{interbonds} \u2212 {common bonds} = {true interbonds}\n\n(13)\n\nWe noted above that we now have two (metric) structures on the network or\ngraph, the original one with its neighborhood structure and distance function,\nd(ni , nj ), and the superstructure given by the clique graph and its coarse grained\nneighborhood structure of physical points and coarse grained distance function,\ndcl (Si , Sj ), which we regard as a protoform of our ordinary macroscopic distance.\nNote that there may still exist a substantial number of interbonds on the lower\nlevel between supernodes Pi , Pj with dcl (Si , Sj ) \u226b 1.\nIn the physics of many degrees of freedom what really matters, or gives \"distance\" a physical content, is not so much some abstract notion of distance but\nthe strength of interaction or correlation between the various constituents. Given\ntwo node sets A, B or the respective subgraphs we can count the number of bonds\nconnecting them and regard this as a measure of their direct mutual dynamical\ncoupling.\nDefinition 3.9 (Connectivity of Subgraphs) With A, B being two node sets\nin a given graph, we denote by |A \u223c B| the actual number of bonds connecting the\nnodes of A with the nodes of B and by |A \u223c B|m the maximal possible number.\nThen we call\n0 \u2264 cAB := |A \u223c B|/|A \u223c B|m \u2264 1\n\n(14)\n\nthe connectivity of the pair A, B. It represents the probability that a randomly\nchosen pair of nodes nA \u2208 A, nB \u2208 B is connected by a bond. |A \u223c B|m depends\nhowever on their relative position in G.\nObservation 3.10 We have the following relations\nA \u2229 B = \u2205 \u2192 |A \u223c B|m = |A| * |B|\n\n(15)\n\n(|A|, |B| the respective number of nodes), hence\ncAB = |A \u223c B|/|A| * |B|\n\n(16)\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n|A|\nA = B \u2192 |A \u223c B|m =\n2\n\n(17)\n\n16\n\n\fFor their intersection we have in general\nA \u2229 B 6= \u2205 \u2192 |A \u223c B|m = |(A \u2212 B) \u223c (B \u2212 A)|m\n+ |(A\u2206B) \u223c (A \u2229 B)|m + |(A \u2229 B) \u223c (A \u2229 B)|m (18)\ni.e:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n|A \u2229 B|\n|A \u223c B|m = |A \u2212 B| * |B \u2212 A| + |A \u2229 B * (|A \u2212 B| + |B \u2212 A|) +\n2\n(19)\nwith A\u2206B being the symmetric difference of A and B.\nIn our papers, cited above, we argued that it is reasonable to treat certain\n(bulk) aspects of the network properties and its evolution in a statistical way.\nThis is particularly necessary if we want to extract some coarse-grained information from it which depends on the collective behavior of many nodes and bonds.\nThat is, we have to take averages over certain portions of the network and/or\n(possibly appreciable) clock-time intervals (which may, nevertheless, correspond\nto infinitesimal intervals on a more macroscopic scale). In the folowing we introduce and describe only those collective variables which may become relevant in\nthe further analysis.\nWe will deal with our network mainly on the level of the web of lumps or the\nclique graph, abbreviated by ST . At each clock-time step or whole clock-time\ninterval, QX/ST consists of a certain overlapping web of lumps or cliques, Pi ,\nhaving some average size (in graph theory usually called order ), that is, number\nof nodes\nhr(P )i := horder of cliquei\n\n(20)\n\nwhere the statistical average is taken over the network and/or an appropriate\nclock-time interval. We assume of course that the phase, QX/ST , the network\nor clique graph is occupying, is sufficiently stable or slowly varying, so that the\nactual clique size, hr(Pi )(t)i is assumed to fluctuate not too much around this\naverage value, hr(P )i. In other words, the lumps are assumed to be fuzzy.\nIn the same sense the average vertex degree can be defined\nhv(P )i := hvertex degreei\n\n(21)\n\nthe average number of active bonds per clique\nhN(P )i := hnumber of active bonds per cliquei\n\n(22)\n\nand the respective averages over the bonds pointing inward or outward, that is,\nconnecting two nodes, the one lying inside, the other outside the lump under\ndiscussion.\nhNin,out(P )i := hnumber of in\u2212 , out \u2212 bondsi\n17\n\n(23)\n\n\fNote that the bond is counted as in if the orientation is Jik = +1 with ni lying\noutside the lump.\nWe consider these latter variables (averaged or non-averaged) as being particularly relevant as they tell us something about the charge fluctuations inside\nthe lumps and through the (fuzzy) boundary. At each clock-time step we have\nan internal charge, Q(t; P ), of the respective lump, P , and due to our dynamical\nnetwork law it holds\nX\nX\nQ(t + \u03c4 ; P ) \u2212 Q(t; P ) =: \u2206Q(t; P ) =\nsi (t + \u03c4 ) \u2212\nsi (t)\nni \u2208P\n\n= q(Nin (t; P ) \u2212 Nout (t; P )) = q(\n\nni \u2208P\n\nX\nin\n\nJik (t; P ) \u2212\n\nX\n\nJik (t; P )) (24)\n\nout\n\nand the corresponding equations when taken with the respective averages.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nAn Alternative Look upon Quantum Theory\nIsolating the Pure \"Quantum Phenomenon\"\n\nAfter this series of preparatory steps we now enter the central part of the paper.\nWe have our model system QX/ST and want to derive quantum theory from it as\nan effective theory living near the continuous \"surface\" of this structure. In doing\nthis we have first to clarify two points. What do we actually mean by quantum\ntheory (understood as a general conceptual framework) and, second, what are the\nlarge-scale phenomena we expect to emerge or survive in this low-energy limit\n(comparedd to the primordial Planck scale).\nAs to the first question, typical models of, say, quantum field theory are usually inspired by their classical counterparts which are then \"quantized\" (following\na certain, one may venture to say heuristic, scheme). Furthermore, covariance,\nspectrum condition etc. are usually imposed. In a first step we think it is easier to\nconcentrate on, what we regard as the essential and model-independent quantum\nphenomena, leaving, for the moment, aside all the additional complications. Take\ne.g. special relativity. To derive it as a macroscopic phenomenon from our underlying QX/ST )-network we need a more detailed understanding of the emergence\nof macroscopic time, which is a veritable problem of its own and will not be dealt\nwith here (this does not mean that it cannot be done; it means rather it has do\nbe done in a separate investigation due to natural limits of space), for reviews\nsee e.g. [36] and [37].\nConjecture 4.1 We conjecture that the model-independent content of \"the\" quantum phenomenon is mainly encoded in the generically complex structure together\nwith the superposition principle, both making up the complex Hilbert-space structure of ordinary quantum theory and leading to the seemingly paradoxical entanglement phenomena.\n18\n\n\fRemark: The soundness of this conjecture will be further illuminated below and\nis perhaps underpinned by the following citations taken from [12] p.216, 218 (see\nalso [43]):\n(Schr\u00f6dinger) . . . the complex structure as carrier of the unobservable\nphase information . . .\n(Dirac) . . . the phase quantity was very well hidden in nature . . .\n\nThese model-independent ingredients can, in a first step, best be studied in\nthe non-relativistic regime by investigating the (hidden) structure of e.g. the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation.\nIn this context it is sometimes argued that some of the peculiar quantum phenomena displayed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, e.g. its instantaneous spreading,\nis an artefact of its lack of relativistic covariance. We think, this is beside the\npoint to some extent. We carefully analyzed this issue in [44] and [45] and showed\nthat exactly the same processes are at work in both the relativistic and the nonrelativistic regime, pointing to a kind of underlying entanglement or non-locality\nof quantum phenomena, being ubiquituous in the whole field. Put sloppily one\nmay say:\nConjecture 4.2 Only observables behave locally or causally while states do, typically, not. This is also the case in the relativistic regime. On the other side, the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation describes the evolution of a state!, not of a quantum field.\nThe underlying reason for this is the following. The energy-momentum content\nor transfer of an observable is typically two-sided, that is, the Fourier-support or\nspectrum (in fact an operator-valued distribution as long as the operator is not\nsmeared with a testfunction)\nZ\n\u22122\neipx A(x)d4 x\n(25)\n\u00c2(p) := (2\u03c0)\np = (p0 , p), x = (x0 , x) four-vectors, px the Minkowski-scalar-product\nA(x) = eiP x * A * e\u2212iP x\n\nP = (H, P)\n\n(26)\n\nhas the following property:\nLemma 4.3 With p belonging to the energy-momentum support of A = A\u2217 , put\nsloppily \u00c2(p) 6= 0 at p in a distributional sense, \u2212p belongs also to the support\nof A or \u00c2.\nProof:\n\u2217\n\n(\u00c2)(p) = (\n\nZ\n\nipx\n\ne\n\n4\n\n\u2217\n\nA(x)d x) =\n19\n\nZ\n\ne\u2212ipx A(x)d4 x = \u00c2(\u2212p)\n\n(27)\n\n\fthat is, \u00c2(p) 6= 0 at p as operator-valued distribution implies the same for its\nadjoint at \u2212p\n\u2737\nRemark: In the theory of operator algebras the above spectrum is usually called\nthe Arveson-spectrum (see e.g. [46] or [47]).\nStates, on the other side, are prepared by applying such local observables (or field\noperators) to the ground state or vacuum, \u03a9. As this is the state with lowest\nenergy (usually set to zero), the negative energy support of A, when applied to\n\u03a9, is by definition cut off, that is,\nsupp(A * \u03a9) \u2282 V +\n\n(28)\n\n(V + the closed forward cone). This inevitable asymmetry in the support of\nstates compared to observables leads to their different (causal) behavior as has\nbeen analysed in our above mentioned papers and has nothing to do with Lorentzcovariance. It is rather a pure quantum phenomenon.\n\n4.2\n\nA Different Look at Schr\u00f6dingers Equation\n\nIn standard quantum theory the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is considered to be only one\nof a couple of possible representations of quantum dynamics, i.e. the configurationspace version. We want to argue in this subsection that one should perhaps change\nones point of view in at least two respects. For one, as we learned from general\nrelativity, space and time seem to have a very peculiar significance of their own\nand do not seem to be a mere mode of representation of physics among many\nother ones being posible (in contrast to the point of view, suggested by e.g. ordinary quantum theory). For another, Schr\u00f6dingers equation is at first glance linear\n(which was severely criticized by Einstein), but it is only linear with respect to\nits complex structure which makes a big difference as we will show.\nIn our (perhaps heretic) view, shared however by quite a few others, it rather\nrepresents an intricate dynamical entanglement of two underlying and in the\nordinary approach largely hidden quantities, which have survived the coarsegraining process if one goes \"bottom-up\", starting from the Planck-scale. If one\ndisentangles this single complex-linear equation it becomes the non-linear coupled\nevolution of two real equations. This fact has long been known, we think however\nthat our interpretation of this phenomenon is a different one.\nThe two perhaps most widely known fields where this has also been done are\nthe stochastic mechanics developed by Nelson and several precursors, and the\nso-called Bohmian mechanics of Bohm et al. To keep the length of our paper\nreasonable we will mention only very few sources, where the interested reader can\nlook up more references, and make up his own mind concerning the pros and cons\nof the various contributions. We mentioned already [20] and [29] to [31] which\n20\n\n\fdeal primarily with stochastic mechanics. From the many papers about Bohmian\nmechanics we cite the following, as we think, quite readable accounts [48] to\n[50] with reference [49] being perhaps particularly interesting as in it Nelson's\napproach has been compared with Bohm's own approach.\nIn more recent times so-called stochastic collapse models have also become\nfashionable (a small selcetion being [51] to [53]). As far as the randomly fluctuating environment, employed in some of these models, can be viewed as a coarsegrained epiphenomenon deriving from a more fundamental layer of microphysics,\nthey may considered to be phenomenological or effective theories, describing a\nmore complex underlying dynamics. Note however that in our approach the fluctuating environment is a dynamical agens of its own which acts but is also acted\nupon by \"matter\".Furthermore we do not employ a particle picture in the form\nof, say, small objects immersed in a random medium. It may however has its\nvalue as a certain approximation.\nIn disentangling the Schr\u00f6dinger equation we follow a traditional line of nonorthodox quantum theory but with a to some extent diffferent working philosophy\nin mind, formulated in observation 3.3. That is, we conjecture that a really\nfundamental law consists always of two parts, i) \"geometry\" acting on \"matter\"\nand ii) \"matter\" acting on \"geometry\", with the first equation being typically\nsignificantly simpler than the latter one. With\n\u03c8 = \u03c11/2 * eiS/~\n\n(29)\n\ni~\u2202t \u03c8 = \u2212~2 /2m * \u2206\u03c8 + V \u03c8\n\n(30)\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger's equation\n\ndecomposes into the conservation equation\n\u2202t \u03c1 = \u2212\u2207 * (\u03c1 * v) with v = 1/m * \u2207S\n\n(31)\n\nand the dynamical equation\n\u221a \u221a\n\u2212\u2202t S = 1/2m * (\u2207S)2 + V \u2212 ~2 /2m * \u2206 \u03c1/ \u03c1\n\n(32)\n\nwhich may be considered as a quantum deformation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, the deformation being the so-called quantum potential (Bohm)\n\u221a \u221a\n(33)\nVq := \u2212~2 /2m * \u2206 \u03c1/ \u03c1\nObservation 4.4 The quantum potential, Vq , is the only place where the \"quantum\" openly enters. Thus, any attempt to explain quantum mechanics as arising\nfrom a more primordial level has to give an explanation for the emergence of this\nterm.\n21\n\n\fWe will show that, in fact, this term encodes in our framework the non-local\nentanglement between the various lumps making up ST in our network QX/ST .\nRemark 4.5 Note that in the conservation equation the quantity \u03c1 enters, while\n\u221a\nin the second equation it is \u03c1, the peculiar statistical nature of which will play\na considerable role in the following sections.\nThere exist corresponding equations for several particles. For two particles we\nhave e.g.\n\u2202t \u03c1 = \u2212(\u22071 * (\u03c1\u22071 S/m1 ) + \u22072 * (\u03c1\u22072 S/m2 ))\n\n(34)\n\n\u2212 \u2202t S = (2m1 )\u22121 (\u22071 S)2 + (2m2 )\u22121 (\u22072 S)2 + V (x1 , x2 )\n\u221a \u221a\n\u221a \u221a\n\u2212 (~2 /2m1 )\u22061 ( \u03c1)/ \u03c1 \u2212 (~2 /2m2 )\u22062 ( \u03c1)/ \u03c1 (35)\nIn the following conjecture we indicate how this disentangled Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation fits in our general picture.\nConjecture 4.6 The conservation equation encodes the action of \"geometry\"\non \"matter\", the deformed Hamilton-Jacobi equation the action of \"matter\" on\n\"geometry\", where \u03c1 is supposed to relate to \"matter\", the phase-function S to\n\"geometry\". These structural elements survive the huge gap between the Planckscale and the middle-energy regime of, say, quantum theory in the form of large\nscale excitation patterns.\nThe role of the above quantities in ordinary quantum theory is the following.\nWe have\nZ\nZ\nZ\n3\n3\n\u03c8i\u2202t \u03c8d x = \u2212 \u03c1\u2202t Sd x + i \u03c11/2 \u2202t \u03c11/2 d3 x\n(36)\nR\nThe latter term on the rhs equals (i/2)\u2202t \u03c1d3 x = 0. Hence \u2212\u03c1 * \u2202t S may be\ninterpreted as an energy density. Correspondingly we have for the momentum:\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u22121\n3\n3\n\u22121\n\u2202j \u03c1d3 x\n(37)\n\u03c8i \u2202j \u03c8d x = \u03c1\u2202j Sd x + (2i)\nThe last term on the rhs is a surface term and hence vanishes; thus \u03c1 * \u2202x S can\nbe regarded as a momentum density.\nBefore we go on we want to address again the longstanding question of the\nreality of, say, the wave function \u03c8 or of its constituents \u03c1 and S. This issue was\nalready discussed in subsection 2.2 and we now want to add a few more facets.\nOne of the most prominent scientists in favor of an undulatory ontological nature\nof \u03c8 was Schr\u00f6dinger (see e.g. his contribution in the de Broglie volume, which\n22\n\n\fcontains quite a few remarkable observations supporting his point of view). One\nargument against this interpretation is the so-called problem of polydimensions,\ni.e. the structure of \u03c8 in the case of several particles, which is in that context\ndefined over the cartesian product of, say, R3 and hence can, at first glance, no\nlonger be interpreted as an extended excitation living in R3 . This point was\nalready raised by Heisenberg at the 1927-Solvay conference (seee [12] p.240f).\n. . . I see nothing in the calculations of Mr. Schr\u00f6dinger that justifies his\nhope that it will be possible to explain or understand in three dimensions\nthe results from polydimensions\n\nWhile Schr\u00f6dinger did not seem to have a coherent underlying theory supporting\nhis own point of view, he evidently envisioned excitations in R3 interpenetrating\neach other (perhaps in a soliton-like manner). We will sketch our own ideas concerning this important question in a preliminary form in the following conjecture.\nConjecture 4.7 [N-Particle Wave Functions]\n1. We think the system-theoretic task, solved by \"Nature\" with the \"invention\" of quantum theory, consists of storing effectively and stably a certain\namount of information in a noisy background, represented by QX/ST .\n2. As the individual grains, Pi , i.e. the physical points, comprise in our picture\nstill a lot of internal degrees or freedom (the nodes and bonds belonging to\nPi ), there should be ample internal space to store the local pieces of different\nexcitation patterns, living and interpenetrating each other in one and the\nsame emvironment (by the way, a task also solved by the human brain).\n3. One possible method consists of letting only a small fraction of internal\ndegrees of freedom contribute to each extended wave pattern. This appears\nto be reasonable anyhow, as quantum theory as we understand it is actually\na weak, low-energy excitation of QX/ST as compared to, say, the Planck\nenergy.\n4. An interesting situation is expected to emerge when the number of particles,\nN, becomes appreciable or macroscopic. There should exist a critical local\noccupation rate above which this weak-field-approximation breaks down. By\nthe same token, the picture of interpenetrating (and to a certain extent\nindividual) particle excitations will become problematical. This impossibility\nto store a too large amount of information in a finite space and the respective\nthreshold are in our view the interface region where quantum mechanical\nmany-body systems start to behave macroscopically. This picture has to be\nworked out in much more detail and will be treated elsewhere as it draws on\na huge corpus of material of its own which has accumulated in the past (for\na cursory discussion see however section 7).\n23\n\n\f5\n\nThe Collective Dynamics of the Web of Lumps\n\nIn the preceding sections we described how a certain extended structure of lumps\nmay emerge within the network as the consequence of a geometric phase transition\nor geometric reorganisation of the underlying network. In this section we want to\nargue that this new phase, dubbed QX/ST , is accompanied by the emergence of\na new class of characteristic collective variables and their respective cooperative\nbehavior which does not yet exist on the more primordial level and which is the\nreason why this new geometric phase may be rightly called an orderparameter\nmanifold.\nRemark: It is not accidental that such a point of view and/or language is a little\nbit in the spirit of the physics of self-organisation or synergetics (see e.g. [54]\nor [55]) as it is in our view pretty much to the point. After all, our underlying\nmedium is a complex dynamical system consisting of a huge number of elementary\nconstituents. It is hence reasonable to employ the corresponding arsenal of tools\nand concepts. We will, due to limits of space, however only introduce a limited\namount of the technical machinery below.\nThe above described superstructure, ST , overlying the primordial network,\nQX, is the deepest of, presumably, a whole hierarchy of increasingly coarsegrained and smooth levels, each of which typically supporting and generating\nits own emergent set of natural variables and laws. In a sense ST functions as\na shell which decouples and shields the upper stories of the hierarchy from the\nmost primordial one. The crucial question to answer is the following.\nProgramme 5.1 Find the modes in which the system operates on a given scale\nof resolution!\nThis is the characteristic question, emerging also in the physics of self-organisation,\nthe Landau-picture of elementary excitations in, say, quantum fluids, or the theory of renormalisation in high-energy physics, to mention a few fields.\nConjecture 5.2 As to the cooperative behavior of our web of lumps we assume\nthe following: The orderparameter manifold, ST , overlying the primordial network, QX, enslaves (a notion taken also from synergetics, see [54]) the more primordial degrees of freedom, that means in our context the node- and bond-variables\nand forces them into a specific cooperative undulatory behavior, put differently,\nthe geometric phase transition manifest itself, among other things, by means of a\nnew collective excitation mode. In brief, order parameters are collective variables\nwhich enslave subsystems.\nThis new collective mode is a spatio-temporal undulation pattern of the Q(P )and the Nin,out (P )-field (see the end of section 3.2) being entangled with it via\nthe underlying dynamical law. The emergent characteristic parameters of this\n24\n\n\fexcitation mode are an oscillation- or correlation time, tpl , and a characteristic (correlation- or oscillation-) length, lpl , supposed to characterize the Planckregime.\nWhile we cannot prove this conjecture at the moment, as we are presently unable\nto solve the very complicated dynamical behavior of our network in greater detail\nand follow it through its presumed phase transition regime into the new phase,\nQX/ST , we will at least try to transform it into an educated guess by providing\na row of more or less coherent arguments supporting this hypothesis.\n1. We mentioned in section 3 in the remark after the definition of a, as we\nthink, typical model of a dynamical network law (definition 3.1) that a\nslight variation of the law yields a new model having very short transients\nand reaches periodic state cycles or (attractors) having only period six, i.e.\nthe whole network state returns into exactly the same state after only four\ntime steps. For sufficiently small networks (only a few nodes) one can do the\ncalculations by hand and follow the evolution and oscillation in detail. For\nnetworks up to several thousand nodes the evolution has been implemented\non a computer (see [38]). Note that such a behavior is quite remarkable,\ngiven the huge acccessible phase space and the relatively complicated evolution law.\nRemark: Such puzzling and still quite mysterious phenomena were also\nmentioned by S.Kauffman in his study of so-called switching nets (cf. e.g.\n[39] p.112 ff or [40]). Such oscillating media are also observed in synergetics\n(cf. e.g. section 4 in [56]).\nThis shows that such things may already happen on the level of the primordial network. In other respects however,such a peculiar law is too regular as\nit does not allow for a diversified pattern creation on the higher levels. The\ninteresting evolution laws are sitting, according to the working philosophy\nexpounded e.g. in the above cited literature (see also [41]) and which we\nare largely sharing, at the edge between chaos and order.\n2. On the other side, the evolution law given in definition (3.1) itself, i.e. with\nthe other rule of switching-on and -off of interaction, Jik , does not show\nthese short transients and periodic state cycles already on the level of its\nprimordial nodes and bonds and therefore seems to behave more erratically\nat least on the most fundamental level (as we learned from a numerical\ninvestigation of its characteristics which were also studied in quite some\ndetail in [38]). It evidently behaves more stochastically and may be nearer\nto this mentioned edge between order and chaos (sitting supposedly on the\nother side). Unfortunately our computer capacities were not large enough\nto study it on the higher level of the web of lumps., which would have\nimplied, among other things, a permanent calculation of these cliques and\n25\n\n\ftheir dynamics (as to such analytical techniques cf. [5]). It may, however, be\npossible that it supports such oszillating modes in its fluctuation spectrum\non this more advanced level of lumps.\n3. On can however try to get some qualitative glimpses how such networks\nmay behave by concentrating on a fixed given lump, P , say. Let us assume that at a certain clock-time, t0 , its charge, Q(t0 ; P ), happens to be\nsomewhat below the average of the charges of the surrounding lumps directly interacting with it (i.e. more or less the so-called local group, see\n[5]). While we cannot make an exact prediction about the corresponding\nstates of the bonds in the immediate environment of P , the laws which we\nintroduced above suggest however that a deficiency of charge in P will induce after some clock-time cycles a reorientation of bonds in favor of more\nbonds pointing inward (with, and this is important, a certain tendency of\novercompensating!). In other words, after a certain lapse of time the charge\nin P will be above average with the excess charge now being presumably\ngreater than the deficiency of charge in the cycle before. Again this surplus charge induces an even more pronounced reorientation of neighboring\nbonds, leading to an even greater deficiency of charge within P , and so on.\nThis process will not stop until it has reached a characteristic excitation\nlevel being typical for both the network (law) under discussion and the\nspecific phase, QX/ST it is occupying.\nThe above qualitative analysis shows that there may well be such a spatiotemporal undulation pattern within the excitation spectrum of the network, extending over the whole web of lumps and being perhaps similar to an array of\ncoupled self-oscillating subunits. The characteristic oscillation period of these\nsubunits (which are assumed to comprise more or less the individual lumps and\nthere immediate neighborhoods) is the Planck-time, tP , the characteristic waveor coherence length is the Planck-length, lP , being, on the other side, a measure\nof the typical diameter of a lump or its local neighborhood. These emergent\nand autonomously generated quantities figure then as the elementary building\nblocks of the corresponding continuum concepts, length, time, energy etc. on the\nsmoother, that is, more coarse-grained scales and show how a complex system\nis capable of generating its own intrinsic scales by a process of self-organisation.\nThat is, these elementary units need not be put in by hand! That is, our subclass\nof networks seem to belong to the class of oscillating media described in e.g. [56].\nIt seems now worthwhile to introduce a limited amount of machinery, being\nemployed in the theory of self-organization or dynamical systems (see e.g. [54]\nto [58]), in order to make the following analysis more concise. Our networks are,\namong other things, complex dynamical systems. On the most fundamental level\ntheir dynamics is assumed to be deterministic (whereas this is not neccessarily\na crucial point due to the shielding phenomenon which decouples the various\nlevels from each other to some extent). In contrast to most of the dynamical\n26\n\n\fsystems, discussed in the literature, the number of their constituents is, on the\none side, very large. On the other side, both the evolution and the phase space is\ndiscrete. This prevents the immediate application of the usual tools of continuum\nmathematics in the analysis of the geometry of, say, attracting sets and the like.\nOn the other side, after a certain coarse-graining, when dealing e.g. with the\nweb of lumps, the dynamics and the medium may be considered, in a good\napproximation, to be quasi-continuous. On the other side, on the higher levels\nthe dynamics is no longer deterministic due to the \"integrating out\" of degrees\nof freedom and corrsponding loss of information. Instead of that we may get\ncertain phenomenological dynamical field equations superposed by a stochastic\ncomponent implementing the additional noise in the network. This then is the\ntypical scenario of synergetics. It is our aim to show that low-energy quantum\ntheory is exactly of this sort, that is, certain emergent dynamical field laws plus\na non-local stochastic component.\nTo exhibit the interplay of statistical averaging and the underlying microscopic\nevolution, we introduce the folowing concepts. We take a particular initial state,\nx0 , say, which lies in the basin of attraction of an attracting set of states, X, say,\nor already in X itself. We assume a discrete evolution law, i.e. an iterated map,\nM. In general, M is not invertible but only an endomorphism. For technical\nreasons it is usually assumed that it is onto. Then we can follow the path the\nsystem takes with starting point x0 , i.e:\nxn := M n x0\n\n,\n\nM n := M * * * M (n-times)\n\n(38)\n\nFor n \u2192 \u221e the states, xn , wander through the attractor, X. With f an observable, defined on the microstate x, we can define its time average (provided it\nexists):\nf := lim 1/T\nT \u2192\u221e\n\nT\nX\n\nf (M n x0 )\n\n(39)\n\nn=0\n\nUnder certain conditions there exists an invariant measure, \u03bc, on X so that\ntime averages become ensemble averages with respect to \u03bc, the averages being\nindependent of the starting point, x0 . Systems with this property are called\nergodic (cf. [59]). How this may come about can be seen as follows. Instead of\nx0 we take a full initial probability distribution, \u03c10 . Under the map M it goes\nover in a new distribution, \u03c11 :\nM : \u03c10 (x) \u2192 \u03c11 (x)\n\n(40)\n\nand in general\n\u03c1n+1 =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1n (y) * \u03b4(x \u2212 My)dy\n27\n\n(41)\n\n\f(called for whatever reason the Frobenius-Perron-equation).\nWe arrive at an invariant density if we have a fixed point, that is:\n\u03c1n+1 (x) = \u03c1n (x) = \u03c1(x)\n\n(42)\n\nIn general it is reasonable to switch to a slightly more general point of view and\nconsider invariant measures instead of densities (or to allow for distributional\ndensities), that is \u03c1(x) \u2192 \u03bc(A) with A some measurable set. The notion of\ninvariance is now expressed as\n\u03bc(A) = \u03bc(M \u22121 A) for all measurable sets\n\n(43)\n\nWe then have\nhf i = f := lim 1/T\n\nT\nX\nn=0\n\nn\n\nf (M x0 ) =\n\nZ\n\nf (x)d\u03bc independent of x0\n\n(44)\n\nX\n\nWhile M is not necessarily invertible, invariance of \u03bc implies that it induces\nan isometric map on the function space (Hilbert space) L2 (\u03bc), thai is, it holds\nZ\nZ\n2\n|UM f | d\u03bc = |f |2d\u03bc with (UM f )(x) := f (Mx)\n(45)\nFor this to make sense the above mentioned technical property that M is onto is\nneeded.\nObservation 5.3 Note that \u03bc(A) measures in effect the average time the system\noccupies states belonging to A.\nAnother useful tool in the analysis of such complex dynamical systems is\nthe method of the correlation functions and their spectral representation. Suppose again that f (x) is an observable defined on our state space. Its timeautocorrelation function is defined by\nhf (t1 ) * f (t2 )iC := hf (t1 ) * f (t2 )i \u2212 hf i2 = lim 1/T\n\nT\nX\nt=0\n\n(f (t + t1 ) \u2212 f ) * (f (t + t2 ) \u2212 f )\n(46)\n\n(provided that such limits do exist). Fourier transformation leads to\nZ\nC\n\u22121/2\nhf (t1 ) * f (t2 )i = (2\u03c0)\n* e\u2212i(t1 \u2212t2 ) * c(\u03c9)d\u03c9\n\n(47)\n\nwith c(\u03c9)d\u03c9 a positive measure, the so-called power spectrum of the respective\nobservable. If we have an invariant measure these correlations can alternatively\n28\n\n\fbe calculated in the ensemble approach (note that, as the evolution is usually\ndissipative, that is, one-sided or not-invertible, t1 , t2 have to be chosen positive).\nThe power spectrum can be used to characterize the type of evolution or/and\nattractor. If there are e.g. sharp peaks in the spectrum they signal the existence\nof extended oscillating modes, buried in the (possibly continuous) background\nnoise. This is exactly the situation we are speculating about in the case of\nour networks and the particular phase, QX/ST , which is, in the language of\ndynamical systems, an attractor. What we will say in the following about the\nqualitative dynamics of our network or the web of lumps overlying it, should be\nconsidered within this wider context which we only briefly sketched above. One\nshould however note that our networks are far more complex than the dynamical\nsystems usually considered in the corresponding literature. For the time being we\nsimply have to assume that our phase QX/ST corresponds to an attracting set,\nthat long-time averages are practically independent of the initial configuration\nand that an invariant measure exists on the attractor, corresponding to QX/ST ,\nso that time averages can be expressed by averages with respect to this measure.\nThis lays the basis for a statistical treatment of the problems to be discussed in\nthe following.\nOur qualitative discussion of the propensity for an oscillating behavior of our\nmedium (the web of lumps) suggests that we will find a sharp peak (actually\ntwo as the spectrum is symmetric) in the Fourier spectrum of the (clock-)time\nautocorrelation function of the charge, Q(P, t), of a given fixed lump, P . That\nis, we conjecture\nZ\nC\nhQ(P, t) * Q(P, t + t1 )i = mode(\u03c9pl ) + remainder\n(48)\nThe spatio-temporal excitation pattern, resulting from the cooperation of these\nindividual resonating lumps, will presumably be much more complex. It could\nbe tested via the correlation among different lumps, i.e:\nhQ(P \u2032 , t\u2032 ) * Q(P, t)i\n\n(49)\n\nAs we want to concentrate in this investigation on the derivation of low-energy\nquantum theory, we will postpone a more detailed discussion of the leading collective modes being prevalent in the vacuum on the Planck-scale. We will only\nbriefly indicate what kind of excitation patterns we are having in mind, as it\nshows that our web of lumps may already contain the so-called string-bits, i.e the\nprerequisites to allow for string-like excitations as cooperative patterns made of\nlocal clusters of lumps ([60]).\nOne possible excitation pattern may have the structure of densely entangled\nchain mail, built from elementary loops (the chain-links) consisting on their side\nof lumps which resonate in a cooperative manner so that a certain amount of\ncharge is pulsating around the respective loop. It is therefore perhaps not too\n29\n\n\ffar-fetched to tentatively associate the lumps with the notorious D0\u2212branes and\ntheir entangled interaction being modelled by a matrix-model (see e.g. [61],[62]).\nRemark: We denote in the following these presumed local clusters of cooperating\nlumps by Ci .\nWhat is important for our further discussion is that the wave-number, kpl ,\nthe pendant of \u03c9pl , should not be associated with some plane-wave excitations.\nThe relevant normal modes are rather such entangled collective excitations as,\nsay, the above mentioned chain mail. The characteristic parameter, kpl , is then\njust the dual of lpl , which, on its side, characterizes the diameter of the local\nresonating lumps or the elementary patterns being built from them, that is the,\nthe local clusters Ci .\nThe characteristic parameters of our web of lumps are related to each other as\nfollows. We assume that the characteristic frequency is the Planck-frequency, the\ncharacteristic wave-number, kpl , the Planck-wave-number etc. These variables\nare related with each other via:\nEpl = ~ * \u03c9pl\nEpl * tpl = ~\ntpl = lpl /c\n\nppl = ~ * kpl\nppl * lpl = ~\n\nlpl = (G~/c3 )1/2\n\n(50)\n(51)\n(52)\n\nwith Epl , ppl , tpl , lpl Planck-energy, -momentum, -time, -length respectively. The\nremaining contributions in the spectrum we assume to be a cetain amount of\npatternless noise plus longer wave-length modulations of this ground oscillation\nwith typical wave-length lpl and oscillation-time tpl (see the next section).\nTo simplify the following discussion and to exhibit the red thread, we neglect,\nin a first step, all the stochastic fluctuations and possible modulations of this\nground wave and concentrate on the leading mode contribution. That is, we\nwrite for a fixed but arbitrary lump (suppressing for the moment an additional\nphase factor)\nQ(P, t) \u2248 Qav + Q0 * cos(\u03c9pl * t)\n\n(53)\n\nQav is the average charge of the lump under discussion, which we assume to be\nthe same over the web of lumps, Q0 is the amplitude of the oscillation. In the\nfollowing section we have to deal with our network and/or the overlying web\nof lumps on several clearly separated scales. The same holds for the respective\nnatural observables emerging on the various scales. The scale of our web of\nlumps we assume to be associated with the Planck-scale, abbreviated by [Lpl ].\nWe further introduce the scale of ordinary quantum theory, denoted by [Lqm ],\nwith the property\n[Lqm ] \u226b [Lpl ]\n30\n\n(54)\n\n\fOn the scale [Lpl ] we can incorporate the additional spatio-temporal fine structure, induced by the resonating local clusters, Ci , of the above described ground\nmode by introducing a space-time dependent phase-factor, \u03c6(x, t), which varies\nover the local clusters of lumps forming the elementary building blocks of, say,\nthe above mentioned chain mail. As it varies spatially on these very short scales,\nthat is, lpl , it is almost invariant on average on larger scales as e.g. [Lqm ] and can\npractically be ignored on this larger scale. Furthermore, it should not change the\nimposed frequency, \u03c9pl in an appreciable way. We hence expect:\n\u2202t \u03c6 \u226a \u03c9pl\n\n,\n\n|\u2202x \u03c6| = O(kpl )\n\n(55)\n\nAssumption 5.4 (Fine Structure of the Physical Vacuum)\nQ(x, t) = Qav + Q0 * cos(\u03c9pl t + \u03c6(x, t)) + noise\n\n6\n6.1\n\n(56)\n\nQuantum Theory as a Low-Energy Limit of\nthe Dynamics of the Web of Lumps\nThe Building Blocks\n\nWe now embark on the derivation of the building blocks of low-energy quantum\ntheory as coarse-grained quantities from our web of lumps. Most important are\nthe two quantities \u03c1 and S. From the quantum-Hamilton-Jacobi equation of\nsection 4 we surmise that S will play a particularly significant role as a unifying\nconcept, mediating between the Planck-, the quantum- and the classical regime.\nWe begin with some heuristic considerations concerning the supposed role of S\nas mediator between these very different scales. Adopting so-called natural units\nwith c and ~ chosen dimensionless, the phase function S becomes a dimensionless\nquantity which should be considered as a sort of generalized action. On the one\nside our working philosophy is that physics is discrete on the fundamental level.\nOn the other side we want to interprete quantities like S, occurring in ordinary\nquantum theory, as something which really exists. This leads to the following\nconjecture.\nConjecture 6.1 The phase function S describes the coarse-grained effect of an\nundulation phenomenon on the level of the web of lumps. More precisely, it counts\nthe (dimensionless) number of oscillations or switches of or within the underlying\nfundamental medium with respect to a fixed but arbitrary reference point. \u2212\u2202t S\nand \u2207S have the dimensions of energy and momentum in natural units, that is,\ninverse time and inverse length or frequency and wave number characterizing the\nundulations in this presumed substratum.\n31\n\n\fObservation 6.2 Note that \u03c1 is intrinsically positive in ordinary quantum theory\nwhile the phase function S can be positive or negative. This makes no problems in\nthe ordinary interpretation where \u03c1 is a probability density and S has a relatively\nfictitious meaning. If we want to attribute some ontological meaning to them the\nsituation is different (see below). It turns out that this \"problem of signs\" may be\nused as a guiding principle in isolating the relevant quantities which survive the\ncoarse-graining process (cf. the related \"problem of scales\", discussed in section\n2.3)\nThe collective excitation pattern, we have described so far, will now serve as\nthe carrier wave of smooth long-wave-length undulations, which modulate the\nground excitation pattern and which vary on their natural scale, [Lqm ] . In\nother words, we will relate the objects of, say, low-energy quantum theory to\ncertain low-frequency/long-wave-length modulations of this underlying very-highfrequency oscillation mode.\nAssumption 6.3 (Quantum Theory) Staying within our approximative picture, we expect the following modulation of the dominant mode in the carrier\nwave if there are low-energy quantum objects around. These quantum objects\nare assumed to be implemented by modulations of small amplitude and frequency\n(compared to the Planck-characteristics, Q0 and \u03c9pl ). That is\nQ(P, t) \u2248 Qav + (Q0 + a(P, t)) * cos(\u03c9pl * t + \u03c6(P, t) + \u03b5(P, t))\n\n(57)\n\na(x, t) , \u03b5(x, t) varying on scale [Lqm ] \u226b [Lpl ]\n\n(58)\n\n|a(P, t)| \u226a Q0 , \u2202t \u03b5(P, t) \u226a \u03c9pl\n\n(59)\n\nwith\n\nand\n\nIn other words, a quantum object is assumed to consist of some extended information pattern, being impressed on the high-frequency carrier wave, representing\non its side the physical vaccum. This impressed information consists of both a\ncomponent implemented as amplitude modulation (i.e., a(P, t)) and a component\nbeing realized as phase-modulation (that is, \u03b5(P, t)).\nWe interprete this modulation pattern in the following way on the level of\nlumps. A space-time dependent tiny fraction, a(P, t), of the nodes within the\ngiven lump, P , joins the number of nodes (is slaved!), Q0 , oscillating collectively\n(in the case a > 0) or leaves this set, i.e. falls out of phase (for a < 0). At the\nsame time the momentary frequency is also changed by a tiny amount, \u2202t \u03b5.\nObservation/Definition 6.4 We now relate |a(x, t)| with \u03c1(x, t) and \u03b5(x, t)\nwith \u2212S(x, t). (\u03c9pl * t) counts, as kind of a generalized action, the (dimensionless) number of oscillations or switches with respect to some arbitrary reference\n32\n\n\ftime (or -point). \u03b5(x, t) or \u2212S(x, t) is the local deviation from this global quantity\n(measured on scale [Lqm ]), induced by the presence of quantum objects. It is satisfying that a(x, t) can be both positive or negative in contrast to \u03c1(x, t). We assume\nhowever that it is either (in this low-energy approximation) positive or! negative,\nas we should expect both particle- and hole-excitations in our medium. These\nmay correspond (in the old but perhaps not outdated Dirac-picture) to particles\nand anti-particles. The detection of the presence of an excitation (or particle) in\nlow-energy quantum theory should, on the other side, not depend on the sign of\na(x, t).\nWith the help of the above formula (57) we can now give \u2212\u2202t S and \u2207S a\nprecise microscopic meaning.\nObservation 6.5 \u2212\u2202t S describes the local deviation of the momentary frequency\nof the undulation pattern from the vacuum value, \u03c9pl , on scale [Lqm ]. \u2212\u2207S * dx\nmeasures on the one side the differential change of the number of periods of\noscillation with respect to the reference point, \u03c9pl * t. On the other side, in order\nto be a physical observable, it must also have a meaning which can be locally\nmeasured in the medium. \u03c6(x, t) varies spatially on scale lpl , i.e. it yields a wave\nnumber of order kpl . \u2212\u2207S * (dx/|dx|) is the local deviation of the wave number\nfrom kpl in direction dx, measured on scale [Lqm ]. \u2207S itself points in the direction\nof the maximal decrease.\nProof of the latter statement: Take a change of phase of 2\u03c0 on scale Lqm in\ndirection dx. We have\n2\u03c0 = \u2207S * dx = \u2207S * (dx/|dx|)|dx|\n\n(60)\n\n\u03bb = |dx| = 2\u03c0(\u2207S * dx/|dx|)\u22121 \u21d2 k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb = \u2207S * dx/|dx|\n\n(61)\n\nHence\n\n6.2\n\nThe Quantum Mechanical Continuity Equation\n\nWe now come to the derivation of the two defining equations making up quantum\ntheory in e.g. the Schroedinger picture. For one particle we have\n\u2202t \u03c1 = \u2212\u2207(\u03c1 * \u2207S/m)\n\n(62)\n\nFor a particle excitation we assume \u03c1(x, t) = a(x, t) \u2265 0. Gauss-law yields\nZ\nZ\n3\n\u2202t\na(x, t)d x = \u2212\n(a(x, t) * \u2207S/m)do\n(63)\nV\n\n\u2202V\n\nThe amount of surplus charge, a(x, t)d3 x, activated by the presence of the\nquantum excitation in the vacuum and participating in the collective motion, is\nR\n\n33\n\n\fconserved in time. \u03c1 * \u2207S is a momentum density, \u03c1 * \u2207S/m a \"velocity density\".\nWe want to understand the above first law microscopically.\nThe above equation, interpreted on the level of the web of lumps, tells us that\nthe surplus charge in V has the tendency to move in the direction of decreasing\nwave number, \u2207S, or longer wavelength, with a prefactor, m\u22121 , which may be\nconsidered as a measure of the stiffness of the excitation against change. This\nseems to be a reasonable behavior.\nRemark 6.6 m was already detected in classical mechanics as a measure of resistance of particle motion in the background medium called vacuum. The above\nmicroscopic interpretation seems to be consistent with this observation.\nIncrease of wave number means shorter wave length, i.e. smaller extension of the\nlocal clusters, Ci , in the direction of \u2207S. This may imply a more intense coupling\namong the lumps cooperating in the respective Ci 's, which may have the effect\nthat more elementaryRcharges, q, are participating in the cooperative movement,\nhence, an increase of V a(x, t)d3 x in the volume V . That is, the first equation of\nlow-energy quantum theory may be a reasonable formula also on the microscopic\nscale.\nWe want to add at this place a comment about the normalisation condition of\nordinary quantum mechanics as a probabilistic theory. In our realistic approach,\nin which \u03c1 is not considered as some probability density but as kind of an (abstract) amount of charge or information perR lump, participating in a collective\nundulating motion, a conservation law like \u03c1d3 x = const may be reasonable.\nOn the other hand, a normalisation to, say, const = 1 does not make physical\nsense in this more general non-probabilistic framework. What may, however, be\nreasonable is a (projective) ray-interpretation as it is sometimes employed anyhow\nin quantum theory (as to this more geometric aspect cf. the interesting paper by\nAshtekar and Schilling; [63]).\nIn the same sense as mentioned before (cf. section 3.1), physics on this primordial scale may be independent of the absolute values of node-charges in this\nweak-field regime. What may rather matter is the relational information content\nbeing stored in the shape of the excitation pattern. This idea does however not\ncontradict the strong probabilistic flavor of ordinary quantum theory. In this\nlatter framework probabilities are closely linked with observations and measurements. There outcomes, on the other side, are of course related to the information content of the excitation patterns under discussion but this relation may be\na subtle one (see section 7).\n\n6.3\n\nThe Quantum-Hamilton-Jacobi Equation, the Local\nContribution\n\nMore demanding is the interpretation of the second equation of low-energy quantum theory. This applies in particular to a microscopic understanding of the\n34\n\n\fso-called quantum potential, which contains the core of quantum behavior. We\nbegin with the first (drift-)term on the rhs of equation (32). Our working philosophy is that the quantum potential contains the non-local stochastic effects while\nthe other terms encode the local and more coherent contributions.\nOur analysis in the preceding sections shows that a local change (on scale\n[Lqm ]) of the action, S(x, t) relative to\nS0 (x, t) := \u03c9pl t or (\u03c9pl t + \u03c6(x, t))\n\n(64)\n\nis accompanied by a change of local wave-number, k(x, t). As we have a coherent\nweb of elementary oscillating circuits, a variation of k(x, t), that is, \u2207S(x, t), will,\nby the same token, induce a local change of frequency, \u2212\u2202t S(x, t). Hence there\nmust exist a dispersion law\n\u2202t S = F (\u2207S)\n\n(65)\n\n(we neglect, for the moment, the other contributions in (32)).\nIn the non-relativistic regime we can relate d\u03c9/dk to a velocity. The role of\nvelocity in our context is played by \u2207S/m. Hence, relating \u2212partialt S with \u03c9\nand assuming a power-law behavior, we can infer\nObservation 6.7\n\u2212\u2202t S = (2m)\u22121 (\u2207S)2\n\n(66)\n\nOn the other side, the potential term, V (x), encodes some external, effective force\nand is model dependent. The really crucial contribution is however the quantum\npotential, Vq .\n\n6.4\n\nThe Quantum Potential\n\nWe now come to the most mysterious term in the (re)interpretation of the equations of low-energy quantum mechanics, that is, the quantum potential\nVq = \u2212(~2 /2m) * \u2206(\u03c11/2 ) * \u03c1\u22121/2\n\n(67)\n\nWe will argue that Vq , as non-relativistic quantum theory is still relatively near\nto the classical regime, being perhaps only a small deformation (compared to the\nPlanck scale), is the only component comprising truely stochastic elements in the\nabove representation. By the same token, it is the term being responsible for the\nseemingly non-local phenomena, being almost ubiquituous in quantum theory.\nWe will phrase it that way:\nConjecture 6.8 The quantum potential, Vq , encodes the non-local aspects of\nquantum theory in a, superficially, local way.\n35\n\n\fRemark 6.9 This non-locality is more hidden in the one-particle situation or\nthe self-interaction among the terms within the excitation pattern belonging to a\nspecific quantum object. It becomes more apparent when several quantum objects\nare involved. On the other hand, the interpretation of the meaning of the physical quantities becomes much more subtle in the latter case (polydimensions); cf.\nsecction 7.\nIf we ignore this term, we have sort of a classical field theory (as is of course\nwell-known). In the free case (V = 0) a solution of\n\u2202t \u03c1 = \u2212\u2207 * (\u03c1\u2207S/m) , \u2212\u2202t S = (2m)\u22121 (\u2207S)2\n\n(68)\n\n\u03c1(x, t) = f (x \u2212 vt) , S(x, t) = mvx \u2212 mv 2 t/2\n\n(69)\n\nis\n\nwith \u2207S = v, that is, \u03c1 spreads \"causally\"; with \u03c1(x, 0) of compact support\nit remains so for all t, being merely shifted with velocity v. This is in sharp\ncontrast to the quantum case, i.e. after addition of Vq . We remarked in section 4.1\nthat we typically observe an instantaneous spreading of (quantum) information\nirrespectively of the details of the model (for the non-relativistic regime see in\nparticular [45]). We emphasize again that this ha, in our view, nothing to do\nwith the relativistic non-covariance of ordinary quantum theory but represents\nrather a (the) pure \"quantum phenomenon\".\nWhen scrutinizing the structure of Vq and having a stochastic interpretation\nin the back of ones mind, two intriguing features strike the eye.\nObservation 6.10 First, the prefactor, ~2 /2m, has the dimension of a diffusion\ncoefficient, i.e. [l]2 /[t], when energy is identified with frequency.\nSecond, if \u03c1 is some statistical sum (or average) over a relatively large number of more primordial degrees of freedom, \u03c11/2 may just describe the standard\ndeviation or typical fluctuation of the additive quantity, \u03c1, about its average.\nThen, the occurrence of the quantum potential in the quantum-Hamilton-Jacobi\nequation tells us that the local momentary frequency of the undulation pattern is\ninfluenced by a diffusive and/or fluctuation contribution. We undertake to clarify\nthe nature of this term in two steps. First, we try to explain its very existence. In\na second step we try to provide an argument why it changes the local frequency.\nWe argued in the preceding sections that, in our view, the apparent nonlocality of quantum theory has its origin in the two-storey structure of the medium\nQX/ST , that is, the physical vacuum and expresses itself in the (as yet not very\nwell understood) complex superposition principle of ordinary quantum theory.\nThe terms we have discussed so far were of a local nature and can be understood already on the level of the web of overlapping lumps, forming the \"surface\nstructure\", ST , of our network QX/ST .\n36\n\n\fWe noted however, that the lumps (that is, on a level of lesser resolution,\nthe physical points), even if they are non-overlapping (in other words, being\nsome distance apart in macroscopic space), may nevertheless be connected in the\nunderlying network by some (perhaps even appreciable) number of interbonds\n(cf. section 3.2). Via these interbonds information may be exchanged almost\ninstantaneously. We expect however that this type of information exchange is\nless coherent and less organized, that is, more stochastic than the information\nexchange taking place among directly overlapping lumps, i.e between infinitesimally neighboring regions of macroscopic space. Our central conjecture is now\nthat the mysterious quantum potential is just the remnant on scale [Lqm ] of this\nkind of non-local coupling between non-neighboring lumps or points!\nWe may consider each given lump or the respective local cluster, C, as an open\nstatistical subsystem, being embedded in the ambient space, QX, acting as kind\nof a reservoir. Each of these lumps or local clusters oscillates in its respective\nlocal coherent mode, described above, having an amplitude, Q0 + \u03c1(x, t) with the\ndeviation, \u03c1(x, t) varying on the larger scale [Lqm ]. Being a sum over a relatively\nlarge number of more elementary degrees of fredom we expect this deviation of\nthe ground oscillation, \u03c1, to fluctuate due to the above described correlations\nbetween the different lumps like\n|\u03b4\u03c1| \u2248 \u03c11/2\n\n(70)\n\nThe reason why we expect this kind of fluctuations to be more coherent than\nthe permanent ground fluctuations, due to almost randomly changing bondorientations among the elementary nodes, is the following. In each lump or local\ncluster a certain fraction of the nodes/bonds is slaved by the collective mode and\nbehaves relatively coherently. By the same token, interbonds between nodes, belonging to these respective sets in the various lumps, are also expected to change\ntheir orientations more coherently than bonds, not belonging to these particular\nsets. The same applies then to the blobs of charge, exchanged via these particular bundles of interbonds connecting the different lumps or local clusters. On\nthe other side, there are a great number of other lumps, our particular lump is\nconnected with via such bundles of interbonds. That is, the incoming or outgoing\nblobs of charge have different phase relations as the local states in the distant\nlumps or local clusters, our given lump is conneted with, are different. We hence\nexpect these fluctuations neither to be completely correlated nor uncorrelated.\nWe therefore arrive at the following conclusion\nConclusion 6.11 The charge fluctuations in a given lump, arising from the\nabove described mechanism, are on the one side expected to be more coherent\nthan the almost patternless groundfluctuations. On the other side, they should\nbe sufficiently random on scale Lqm to justify the above standard fluctuation formula. We answer our first question by claiming that the quantum potential arises\n37\n\n\fjust from this particular kind of non-local information exchange between distant\nlumps.\nGiven that there exists such a type of fluctuation, with |\u03b4\u03c1| \u2248 \u03c11/2 , the next\nquestion is, how does this fluctuation pattern effect a change of local frequency\n\u03b4(\u2212\u2202t S(x, t)) = \u2212(~2 /2m) * \u2206(\u03c11/2 ) * \u03c1\u22121/2\n\n(71)\n\nOne may at first make up ones mind about how a mechanism can change at all\nthe local frequency with the corresponding amplitude, Q0 + \u03c6(x, t) being more or\nless kept fixed. The period of the ground cycle is of order tpl . This time interval\nconsists of a consecutive number of clock-time intervals, \u03c4 ,\ntpl = N * \u03c4\n\n(72)\n\nIn each clock-time interval, \u03c4 , the charge in a given lump, P , is changed by the\namount\nX\nX\nJik (t; P ) \u2212\nJik (t; P )) (73)\n\u2206Q(t, P ) = q(Nin (t; P ) \u2212 Nout (t; P )) = q(\nin\n\nout\n\n(cf. section 3.2). If this change per clock-time interval is increased locally by\nsome dynamical mechanism which results in a local change of the network state\nin and around the lump under discussion, more specifically, bigger positive \u2206Q\nin the ascending part of the cycle, bigger negative jumps in the descending part,\nwith Qmax kept essentially fixed by some other stabilizing mechanism, the local\nfrequency will increase and vice versa, since the necessary Q0 is filled up in\na shorter or longer clock-time interval. In this sense one may envisage how\namplitude and frequency can vary more or less independently.\nThe quantum potential, and by the same token, its effect on the local frequency, would vanish locally if \u2206\u03c11/2 = 0. On the other side, we still expect the\nlocal amplitude to fluctuate on average by the amount \u03c11/2 . A locally constant\n\u03c1 means, according to our interpretation, that the neigboring grains experience\nthe same amount of avergage fluctuation. We have now to remember that both\nthe ground frequency, \u03c9pl or the modulated frequency, \u03c9pl + \u2202t S(x, t), and the\ncorresponding amplitudes are considered to be emergent quantities, being created\nby an autonomous process of self-organisation within the network QX/ST . In\nother words, these particular values within or around some lump or local cluster,\nC, are the result of the local network state as a whole. If this local environment\nis changed, we have to expect the same for the local values of these collective\nquantities.\nIf \u2206\u03c11/2 \u2276 0 around a given lump, the charge fluctuation within the lump is\ngreater/smaller on avergage compared to the surrounding lumps (which can be\ninferred from Gauss-law). According to our primordial network laws discussed in\nsection 3.1 and its implications on the level of the web of lumps, described in section 3.2, higher charge fluctuation in a lump means a higher level of reorientation\nof so-called interbonds during a cycle of the collective undulation.\n38\n\n\fObservation/Definition 6.12\n\u2206\u03c11/2 \u2276 0\n\n(74)\n\nleads to a higher/lower bond-fluctuation rate in the lump or the local cluster under\ndiscussion compared to the neighborhood. We call this bond-fluctuation rate the\nbond-volatility. It is another example of an emergent collective quantity.\nWe conjecture now that such a higher/lower bond-volatility (relative to the surrounding lumps or local clusters) will enhance or diminish the hight of the jumps\nwe were talking about above and thus increase or reduce the local frequency.\nWe frankly agree that this is, so far, only a qualitative analysis, but we know of\nrelated effects in other fields of physics. See e.g. [64] for a stochastic triggering or\nenhancement of various resonance phenomena. We expect a similar mechanism\nto be at work in our complex dynamical system.\nA last point to mention is the physical meaning of the \"normalisation\" of the\nterm by \u03c11/2 in the denominator. Such small deviations from the huge vacuum\nvalues, we are talking about, are so-called \"weak-field phenomena\". We therefore expect that there exists a linear relation between the fluctuation of local\ncharge, \u03c11/2 , and the number of nodes, being involved in this fluctuation. One\nwould hence get the change of frequency by following the charge variation at a\ngeneric node over one cycle. One has hence to divide by the amount of total\ncharge fluctuation in the lump to get the change in frequency. This explains the\noccurrence of the denominator in the quantum potential. The proportionality of\nthe respective quantities is, on the other side, encoded in the prefactor, ~2 /2m.\n\n7\n\nA Brief Commentary on Several-Particle Systems, the Transition towards Macroscopic Systems and State Vector Reduction\n\nIn the preceding sections we have mainly discussed the one-particle quantum theory. We have omitted so far several- and many-body systems, the transition to\nthe macroscopic regime and the notorious and highly facetted quantum mechanical measurement problem. One reason for this restriction was to keep the paper\nwithin reasonable length, since some of the above mentioned topics have a long\nand venerable history of their own and need a separate treatment. We want in\nthe following to only briefly indicate how we plan to procede in future work,in\norder to cope with these problems.\nIn a first step we have to discuss the necessary changes which occur in connection with several quantum objects, roaming through our network. As to this\nset of questions we made already some preliminary remarks in 4.7. Note also the\ncritical attitude of Heisenberg expressed in the utterance preceding our own conjecture about the so-called problem of polydimensions. What we try to accomplish\n39\n\n\fbelow is exactly to supply an interpretation of the results from polydimensions in\nthree dimensions, the possibility which Schroedinger had in his mind and which\nHeisenberg considered to be impossible. It becomes however apparent that the\nsituation is much more subtle than Schroedinger probably expected and that this\ntask cannot be accomplished in a naive sense (which Heisenberg rightly criticized). It again turns out, that our concept of the two storeys of space-time or\nthe vacuum is crucial for solving this puzzle, a concept, which Schroedinger did\nnot yet have at his disposal!\nBefore going into the more technical details, we want to scrutinize the above\ncited critical dictum of Heisenberg. Is it really impossible to envisage the quantum mechanical several-particle situation in the ordinary 3-dimensional cordinate\nspace we are living in? Let us take a classical N-particle system with N sufficiently large and describe it within the framework of classical statistical mechanics. It has, on the one hand, several features which are similar to the quantum\nmechanical wave-function representation, as both systems have many elementary\ndegrees of freedom. On the other hand, it has the advantage that it can be\ncompletely understood!\nAgain, the so-called one-particle distribution function, \u03c11 (x) is both a local\nprobability and (as a particle density) a local classical observable, that is, it has an\nimmediate interpretation in 3-dimensional coordinate space. The meaning of the\npair distribution function or (modulo appropriate normalisation) the two-particle\ncorrelation, \u03c12 (x1 , x2 ) is a little bit more abstract. In some loose sense it may be\ncompared with the \u03c1(x1 , x2 ) of two-particle Schroedinger theory. On the one side,\nit figures as a function over abstract R3 \u00d7 R3 . On the other hand, it describes a\nconcrete feature of our compound system as a whole, that is, a global property\nof our aggregate of N particles, living in the ordinary 3-dimensional coordinate\nspace. More specifically, it encodes the mutual influence of the relative positions\nof the elementary constituents of our system on each other. To put it succinctly:\nWhile formally being a function over R3 \u00d7 R3 , it nevertheless encodes a concrete\nproperty of our system living in three dimensions.\nWe now come to quantum theory. In the situation of a single quantum excitation it was not necessary to go into the possible details of the fine-structure of e.g.\nthe charge modulations within or among the lumps or local clusters, as only the\ntotal charge modulation, \u03b4Q0 (P, t) = a(P, t), entered in the coarse-grained equations of low-energy quantum theory. In the several-particle theory (we discuss in\nthe following for convenience only the two-particel case) (\u03c1, S) depend now on two\ncoordinates (see equations (34),(35) ), in other words, they are now of an openly\nnon-local nature in contrast to the one-particle case, where the non-locality is\nmore hidden, as has been described above.\nWe may now envisage that we have in general two (or several) entangled excitation patterns, consisting of two more or less distinguishable modulations of the\nhigh-frequency ground-wave. These modulations are, as was already explained\nabove, weak-field excitations on the comparatively large scale [Lqm ] \u226b [Lpl ]. As\n40\n\n\fonly a small fraction of the elementary charges or nodes is involved in these weak\ndeformation patterns, there is ample space in the lumps (or local clusters) for\napproximately individual pulse patterns to coexist and interact or influence each\nother only weakly. They are however entangled in general unless the two-particle\nstate is a product-state, that is\n\u03c6(x1 , x2 ) 6= \u03c61 (x1 ) * \u03c62 (x2 )\n\n(75)\n\nWe now try to understand the mysterious phenomenon of entanglement.\nConjecture 7.1 (Entanglement) What is called entanglement in ordinary quantum theory, is the non-local interaction (respectively, exchange of elementary\ncharges) among the different excitation modes (describing the different quantum objects) via the bundles of interbonds connecting the different lumps or local clusters. That is, as in the above example of classical statistical mechanics,\n\u03c1(x1 , x2 ), S(x1 , x2 ) describe no longer completely local properties of the system\nbut express a complex non-local entanglement-pattern, permeating through our\ncomplicated two-storey substrate, QX/ST .\nZ\n(76)\n\u03c11 (x1 ) := \u03c1(x1 , x2 )d3 x2\ncollects e.g. all the different contributions, resulting both from the entanglement\nwith the components of the second excitation in the other lumps and coming\nfrom the first excitation itself (as in the one-particle situation). In the particular\ncase of a free Hamiltonian and a product initial-state both excitations move\nindependently of each other and remain non-entangled, that is\n\u03c1(x1 , x2 ) = \u03c11 (x1 ) * \u03c12 (x2 )\n\n(77)\n\nIn this case each particle receives non-local information only from its own distant\ncomponents in the other lumps as described above.\nRemark: We assume, for reasons of simplicity (as this section is only of a cursory\nand preparatory nature), that the particles are distinguishable.\nNote however that a non-product state, \u03c1(x1 , . . . , xn ), cannot be uniquely decomposed into a product state and a contribution encoding the entanglement with the\nother particle-excitations in the distant lumps. In any case for fixed (x1 , . . . , xn ),\nin the entangled situation, a certain fraction of the elementary charges belongs,\nso to say, to all the involved lumps at the same time as they oscillate between\nthem via the bundles of respective interbonds. These and related phenomena\nhave to be analyzed more carefully in future work.\nConclusion 7.2 The above cursory analysis shows, that \"the results from polydimensions\" can be understood in a satisfactory way in three dimensions under\nthe proviso that we accept the two-storey structure of space-time or the physical\nvacuum.\n41\n\n\fIn a next step one can envisage what happens if the number of these coexisting\nexcitations become too large in a given volume of space. In a many-body wavefunction\n\u03c8(x1 , . . . , xN ) N \u226b 1\n\n(78)\n\neach of the approximately individual excitation modes has to be entangled nonlocally with the other modes and/or with its own components in the distant\nlumps. If N exceeds a certain critical range of values, a complete quantumentanglement may not longer be possible. The weak-field picture may begin to\nbreak down as all the available information channels (that is, the interbonds\namong the different lumps) are occupied or overcrowded. The wave-function will\nstart to decay and goes over into a (partial mixture), that is, an incompletely\nentangled state.\nA last point to mention is the infamous measurement problem. The seemingly\ninstantaneous state-reduction by a measurement interference (in fact the contact with a peculiarly tuned macroscopic apparatus), while being on the surface\nof a quasi-local nature, will nevertheless spread its corresponding (decoherence)information all over the microsystem almost instantaneously via the network of\nexisting interbonds. It is thus yet another manifestation of the peculiar non-local\ncharacter of the vacuum, described in the preceding sections.\nRemark: An, in our view, quite up to date discussion of some of the impending\nproblems may be found in section 2 of [65].\n\nReferences\n[1] M.Requardt:\n\"Cellular Networks as Models for Planck-Scale Physics\",\nJ.Phys.A:Math.Gen. 31(1998)7997, hep-th/980613\n[2] T.Nowotny, M.Requardt: \"Dimension Theory on Graphs and Networks\",\nJ.Phys.A:Math.Gen. 31(1998)2447, hep-th/9707082\n[3] T.Nowotny, M.Requardt: \"Pregeometric Concepts on Graphs and Cellular Networks\", invited paper J.Chaos, Solitons and Fractals 10(1999)469, hep-th/9801199\n[4] M.Requardt: \"Spectral Analysis and Operator Theory on (Infinite) Graphs . . . \",\nmath-ph/0001026, under consideration by JPA\n[5] M.Requardt: \"(Quantum) Space-Time as a Statistical Geometry of Lumps in\nRandom Networks\", Class.Quant.Grav. 17(2000)2029, gr-qc/9912059\n[6] N.Rosen:\"Kann man die quantenmechanische Beschreibung der Wirkichkeit als\nvollstaendig betrachten?\", in P.C.Aichelburg,R.U.Sexl (eds.) \"Albert Einstein, . . .\n\", Vieweg, Braunschweig 1979\n\n42\n\n\f[7] C.F.v.Weizs\u00e4cker:\"Quantum Theory and Space-Time\" in Symposium on the Foundations of Modern Physics, eds.
