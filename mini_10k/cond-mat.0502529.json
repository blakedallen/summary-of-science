These present\nneither defects nor phonons, offering a powerful tool for\ninvestigating the quantum behavior of periodic systems\nunder unique control possibilities. Thus, ultracold atoms\ntrapped in OLs show fascinating resemblances with solidstate physics, which range from Bloch oscillations [1, 2]\nand Wannier-Stark ladders [3], to Josephson arrays of\nBose-Einstein condensates (BECs) [4], or to the superfluid to Mott-insulator transition [5].\nThese remarkable experiments have been performed in\nregular cubic OLs. However, these lattices do not exhaust\nthe rich possibilities offered by optical potentials. More\nsophisticated lattice geometries have been proposed, as\nhoney-comb [6] or Kagom\u00e9 and triangular [7] lattices. Beyond, controlled defects may be introduced to generate\nrandom or pseudorandom potentials [8], allowing for the\nrealization of Kondo-like physics [9], Anderson localization and Bose-Glass phases [10]. Exploiting this possibility, laser speckle fields have been employed very recently\nto produce BECs in random potentials [11, 12, 13] opening very exciting new experimental possibilities.\nBridging between ordered and disordered structures,\nquasicrystals (QC) have attracted a wide interest since\ntheir discovery in 1984 [14]. QCs are a long-range ordered\nmaterials but without translational invariance, and consequently they share properties with both ordered crystals and amorphous solids [15]. In particular, QCs show\nintriguing structure [16] as well as electronic conduction\nproperties [17] at the border between ordered and disordered systems.\nSurprisingly, up to now, only few works have been devoted to optical analogues of QCs, despite of the fact\nthat OLs offer dramatic possibilities for designing a wide\nrange of geometries [18]. Optical QCs have been first\nstudied in laser cooling experiments [19], in which the\natomic gas, far from quantum degeneracy, was confined\nin a dissipative OL where quantum coherence was lost\ndue to spontaneous emission. In these systems, the temperature and spatial diffusion were found to behave simi-\n\nlarly as in periodic OLs. The physics of 1D quasiperiodic\nOLs has also been subject of recent research in the context of cold atomic gases, including a proposal for the\natom-optical realization of Harper's model [20], and the\nanalysis of Fibonacci potentials [21].\nIn this Letter, we study the dynamics of a BEC in a\n2D optical QC. First, we show that the BEC wavefunction displays quasi-periodic long-range order, a property\nthat may be easily probed via matter-wave interferometry. Second, we show that macroscopic quantum coherence dramatically modifies the transport on the lattice\ncompared with the dissipative case. On the one hand,\ndue to quasi-disorder in optical QC, spatial localization\noccurs, in contrast to ballistic expansion in periodic lattices. The crossover between ballistic expansion and localization is analyzed when the quasi-periodicity of the\nlattices is continuously increased. On the other hand, we\nshow that due to extended character of the BEC wavefunction, Bloch oscillations take place. These oscillations\nare however quasi-periodic rather than periodic. Additionally, we briefly discuss the effects of the interatomic\ninteractions in the BEC diffusion.\n\nFIG. 1: Left: laser arrangement (see text for details). Right:\nQuasi-periodic lattice potential for Nb = 5, V0 < 0 and \u03b1j =\n0. White points correspond to potential minima.\n\nIn the following we consider a dilute Bose gas trapped\nin the combination of a smooth\nharmonic potential\n\u0001\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n2\u2212\n2\n2 2\nVho (\u2212\nr) = M\n\u03c9\nr\n+\n\u03c9\nz\nplus\nan OL Vlatt (\u2212\nr \u22a5 ).\nz\n\u22a5 \u22a5\n2\n\n\f2\nIn the previous expression, M is the atomic mass, \u03c9j are\n\u2192\nthe harmonic trap frequencies, and \u2212\nr \u22a5 = (x, y) is the\nposition vector on the lattice plane. We assume \u03c9z to be\nlarge enough to keep a 2D physics on the xy plane. We\nconsider a laser configuration [19] consisting on Nb laser\nbeams arranged on the xy plane with Nb -fold symmetry\n\u2192\nrotation (Fig. 1). The polarization \u2212\n\u01eb j of laser j with\n\u2192\n\u2212\nwavevector k j is linear and makes an angle \u03b1j with the\nxy plane. The optical potential is thus [22]:\nNb\nX\n\u2192\n\u2212 \u2192\n\u2212\nV0\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u01eb j e\u2212i( k j * r \u22a5 +\u03c6j )\nEj \u2212\nVlatt (\u2212\nr \u22a5) = P\n2\n| j Ej | j=0\n\n2\n\n, (1)\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 Ej \u2264 1 stand for eventually different laser\nintensities and \u03c6j are the corresponding phases. In the\nfollowing, we are mostly interested in the fivefold symmetric configuration (Nb = 5, Ej = 1), similar to the\nPenrose tiling [23], which supports no translational invariance (see Fig. 1). The lattice displays potential wells\nwhich are clearly not periodically arranged. We also consider the configuration obtained by switching off lasers 1\nand 4, which results in an anisotropic periodic lattice.\n1) Equilibrium properties The stationary BEC\nwavefunction \u03c80 is obtained from evolution in imaginary\ntime of the 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE):\ni\nh\n\u2192\n\u2212\ni~\u2202t \u03c8 = \u2212~2 \u2207 2 /2M + Vho + Vlatt + g2D |\u03c8|2 \u03c8 , (2)\np\nwhere g2D = 8\u03c0~3 \u03c9z /M asc , with asc the s-wave scattering length. In order to elucidate the long-range order\nproperties of the BEC, we compute the momentum distribution of \u03c80 . In the periodic case (Fig. 2a), as expected,\nthe momentum distribution displays discrete peaks corresponding to combinations of elementary basis vectors\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u03ba 2 with integer co\u03ba 1 + n2 \u2212\nof the reciprocal lattice, n1 \u2212\nefficients n1 and n2 . As obtained in previous experimental works [24, 25], this confirms the periodic long-range\norder of \u03c80 . The quasi-periodic case (Fig. 2b) is more\nintriguing, resulting in a more complex structure. The\nmomentum distribution also displays sharp peaks, being\nthe signature of a long-range order which is quasiperiodic rather than periodic [26]. As in the periodic case,\nthe positions of the peaks are linear combinations of intePNb \u22121 \u2212\n\u03ba j where\nnj \u2192\nger numbers of Nb = 5 wavevectors: j=0\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u03ba 0 = k 1 \u2212 k 0 and \u03ba j = R[\u03c6j ] \u03ba 0 is the wavevector\n\u2192\nobtained by a rotation of angle \u03c6 = 2\u03c0j/N of \u2212\n\u03ba . The\nj\n\nb\n\nmeasurements, standard in periodic OLs [24, 25], can be\neasily extended to quasi-periodic ones.\n\n0\n\nreciprocal lattice thus clearly shows a five-fold rotation\nsymmetry incompatible with any translation invariance\n[27]. This resembles the Penrose tiling [23] and the first\nsolide state QCs observed via Bragg diffraction [14].\nThe discussed momentum distribution can be directly\nimaged via matter-wave interferometry after a time-offlight expansion [28]. Indeed, although the interactions\nare crucial for determining local populations of each potential well, they do not contribute significantly to the\nfree BEC expansion after release from the trap [24]. Such\n\nFIG. 2: Matterwave interference pattern of a BEC released\nfrom a combined OL and harmonic trap: a) periodic case;\nb) quasi-periodic case. Both correspond to 87 Rb and V0 =\n\u221210ER , where ER = ~2 k2 /2M is the recoil energy.\n\n2) Quantum transport - Certainly, not all physical\nproperties of optical QCs can be directly interpolated\nfrom the behavior of periodic lattices. Indeed, solid QCs\nshow intriguing dynamical properties that are not yet\ncompletely understood [15]. In the following, we investigate dynamical properties of quasi-periodic lattices.\nCoherent diffusion - Starting from the equilibrium\nwavefunction \u03c80 , we consider the situation in which the\nharmonic trap is switched-off at t = 0, letting the BEC\nevolve in the OL. The BEC expansion is then computed\nusing a Crank-Nicholson algorithm for the real timedependent GPE (2). Figure 3 (inset) shows the time\nevolution of hx2 i and hy 2 i of the interacting BEC along\nx and y respectively. In the periodic case, the condensate expands coherently as one expects from tunnel couplings between adjacent lattice sites. In order to infer\na convenient fitting functional for the expansion of the\ninteracting BEC, let us recall that in free space for large\ntimes hrj2 (t)i \u221d vj2 t2 with vj \u221d 1/M [28]. In periodic\nlattices, the inertia is enhanced, and the expansion is expected to be as in free space but substituting the atomic\nmass M by an effective mass M \u2217 > M . We thus expect\nvj \u221d 1/M \u2217 and M/M \u2217 \u221d J where J is the site-to-site\ntunneling rate [29]. Numerical computations for various\ndepths of the lattice potential V0 show that vj2 decreases\nexponentially with V0 as expected from the well-known\nexponential decay of J. Anisotropic ballistic expansion\nof the BEC reflects the anisotropy of our periodic lattice.\nThe behavior of the BEC in the quasiperiodic lattice\nis dramatically different, since after a short transient\nthe BEC localizes [30] (inset of Fig. 3). This behavior\nstrongly contrasts with results obtained in the context\nof laser cooling where similar classical normal expansion\n(hrj2 (t)i \u223c 2D\u0303j t) was found for both periodic and quasiperiodic OLs [19]. Here, spatial localization is a coherent\neffect induced by quasi-disorder due to the lack of periodicity. Indeed, the BEC populates localized (Wannier-like)\nstates centered on each lattice site. In the periodic case\nthese states have all the same energy and are strongly\ncoupled through quantum tunneling. On the contrary,\nin the quasi-periodic lattice, the sites have different energies. In particular, the typical difference of depths of\n\n\f3\nadjacent sites (denoted \u2206 below) can be of the order of\nmagnitude of (but smaller than) the potential depth. The\ntunneling is not resonant and the BEC localizes.\nThe remarkable flexibility of OLs [18] allows for the accurate study of the competition between tunneling and\nquasi-disorder. By ramping up gradually the intensity\nof lasers 1 and 4 while keeping constant 0, 2 and 3, one\nturns continuously from an anisotropic periodic lattice to\na five-fold symmetric quasiperiodic one, and hence from\nballistic expansion to spatial localization. For small intensity of the control lasers 1 and 4, the quasiperiodicity\nis mainly compositional (the sites are still periodically\ndisplaced but the on-site energies are different from site\nto site). We define the quasi-disorder \u2206 parameter as the\nvariance of the differences of on-site energies in adjacent\nsites. From the previous discussion and to compare to\nthe results of the non-degenerate case [19] we fit\n2\nhrj2 (t)i = hrj0\ni + 2Dj t + vj2 t2 .\n\n(3)\n\nIn the considered range of parameters, all calculations\nfit well with Eq. (3) with a negligible diffusive term\n2Dj t. We characterize the expansion along the xdirection through the ballistic velocity vj . The behavior of vx versus the quasi-disorder parameter \u2206 is shown\nin Fig. 3 for the interacting BEC and it is compared\nto the non-interacting case. For the latter, we simultaneously switched off the interactions at t = 0 [32]. In\nboth cases, as expected, coherent diffusion dramatically\ndecreases when quasi-disorder increases. Spatial localization occurs for \u2206 & Jx , with Jx the tunneling rate\nbetween adjacent sites along the x-direction [33]. This\nsupports the interpretation that competition between coherent tunneling and inhomogeneities turns into localization as soon as tunneling becomes non-resonant.\n0.005\n10\n\n4\n\n0.004\n\n10\n\n3\n\n0.003\n\n10\n\n2\n\n2\n\nx perio\ny perio\n\n(4\u03c0M vx / hk)\n\n2\n\n<(k [x,y]) >\n\nx,y quasi\n0\n\n500\n\n0.002\n\n1000 1500\n\u03c9R t\n\n0.001\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\u2206/Jx\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\nFIG. 3: Crossover from ballistic to localization regimes with\n(squares) and without (circles) interactions, for V0 = \u22127.5ER .\nInset: Coherent diffusion in periodic and quasi-periodic lat2\ntices for V0 = \u22125ER . Fits to hrj2 (t)i = rj0\n+ 2Dj t + vj2 t2 in\nthe periodic case are also shown.\n\nTo understand the effect of interactions that can help\n(\u2206 . 0.2Jx in Fig.3) or hinder (\u2206 & 0.2Jx in Fig.3)\ndiffusion, note first that two phenomena contribute to\nlocalization: (i) initial inhomogeneities (due to disorder\n\nand harmonic confinement) that appear in the dynamics\nthrough the interaction term g2D |\u03c80 |2 [see Eq.(2)] and\n(ii) inhomogeneities associated to quasi-disorder. Because of these inhomogeneities, quantum tunneling is\nnot resonant and thus less efficient. However, during\ndiffusion, the interaction energy is converted into kinetic energy and this tends to fasten the expansion. For\nsmall quasi-disorder, the second phenomenon dominates\nso that interactions contribute to expansion whereas\nfor larger quasi-disorder, the inhomogenities significantly\nhinder tunneling so that interactions contribute to localization. The non-trivial interplay between disorder and\ninteractions will be the subject of further research.\nQuasiperiodic Bloch oscillations - One of the most\nappealing predictions of the quantum theory of solids\n[27] is that homogeneous static forces induce oscillatory\nrather than constant motion in periodic structures [34].\nThe corresponding Bloch oscillations have already been\nobserved in superlattice superconductors [35] and on cold\natoms in OLs [1, 2]. It is a fundamental question whether\nsuch a phenomenon also exists in less ordered systems like\nQCs. Arguments based on general spectral properties of\nQCs [36] and numerical simulations of 1D Fibonacci lattices [37] support the existence of Bloch oscillations in\nquasiperiodic lattices. However, to the best of our knowledge, this effect has never been observed experimentally.\nUsing accelerated lattices [1, 2] or gravity [38] (we consider the latter), this question can be addressed experimentally in the discussed arrangement (Fig. 1). Starting\nfrom \u03c80 we switched-off the harmonic trap and the interactions at time t = 0 and tilt the quasiperiodic lattice in\nthe x direction [39]. The latter evolution of the quantum\ngas is shown in the inset of Fig. 4. We find noisy-like\noscillatory motion in the (tilted) x direction and no motion in the (non-tilted) y direction. The oscillations in\nthe x direction are clearly not periodic [40]. However,\nthey definitely have an ordered structure, which is evidenced by the appearance of discrete sharp peaks in the\ntime Fourier transform of the BEC mean position hx(t)i\n(Fig. 4), corresponding to a quasiperiodic motion [26].\nThe Bloch-like quasiperiodic oscillations can be interpreted as follows. Both in periodic and quasiperiodic\nlattices, the BEC wavefunction extends over many lattice wells, and can be decomposed into a sum of localized\n(Wannier-like) states. Due to the applied external force,\nthese energy states are arranged in a Wannier-Stark ladder. In periodic lattices, the energy separation \u2206E between the ladder states is fixed, leading to periodic Bloch\noscillations of period \u221d ~/\u2206E. However, for quasiperiodic lattices, a discrete set of different (non commensurate) differences of on-site energies in adjacent wells\noccurs (i.e. a non-equally spaced Wannier-Stark ladder)\nleading to quasiperiodic (instead of periodic) oscillations.\nPurely random potentials would result in a continuous set\nof differences of on-site energies leading, as expected, to\nthe disapearance of any sort of Bloch-oscillations.\nSummarizing, we have investigated the physics of\nBECs trapped in optical QCs. We have shown that\n\n\f4\n\n(i) the equilibrium BEC wavefunction displays longrange quasiperiodic order and that (ii) quantum trans-\n\nport shares properties with both ordered and disordered\nsystems. On the one hand, because of quasi-disordered\ninhomogeneities, diffusion turns from ballistic to localization when quasi-periodicity is switched on. On the other\nhand, because of coherence extending over several lattice\nsites, quasiperiodic Bloch oscillations occur in quasiperiodic BECs.\nThe discussed arrangement can be easily generated\nusing standard techniques, offering an exciting tool\nfor controlled studies of the transition between periodic, quasiperiodic and fully disordered systems in cold\ngases, a major topic of current experimental research\n[11, 12, 13]. In addition, the system can be used to address experimentally some unsolved issues on QCs, as e.g.\nthe application of the renormalization theory to the 2D\ncase [15].\nWe thank P. Verkerk, M.

However, this could turn out to be relevant in experiments, since the presence of interactions may smear out\n\nthe discrete spectrum and hence lead to damping or even\nsupression of the quasiperiodic Bloch oscillations.\n[40] The amplitude of the quasiperiodic oscillations may be\nenhanced by reducing the intensity of beams 1 and 4.\nThis would increase the extension of the localized wavefunctions.
