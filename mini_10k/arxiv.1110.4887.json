The power of observations in cosmology is clear\nfrom the observations of supernovae of Ia (SN Ia) which dramatically changed,\nabout a decade ago, the then standard picture of cosmology - of an expanding\nuniverse evolving under the rules of general relativity such that the expansion\nrate should slow down as cosmic time unfolds. Surveys of cosmologically distant\nSN Ia (Riess et al. 1998; Permutter et al. 1999) indicated the presence of new,\nunaccounted - for dark energy that opposes the self-attraction of matter and\ncauses the expansion of the universe to accelerate. When combined with indirect\nmeasurements using cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, cosmic\nshear and studies of galaxy clusters, a cosmological world model has emerged\nthat describes the universe at flat, with about 70% of it's energy contained in\nthe form of this cosmic dark energy (Seljak et al. 2005).

This violation gives a reverse gravitational effect. Due\nto this effect, the universe gets a jerk and the transition from the earlier deceleration phase to the recent acceleration phase take place (Caldwell et al 2002).\nThe cause of this sudden transition and the source of accelerated expansion is\nstill unknown. In physical cosmology and astronomy, the simplest candidate\nfor the DE is the cosmological constant (\u039b), but it needs to be extremely finetuned to satisfy the current value of the DE density, which is a serious problem.\nAlternatively, to explain the decay of the density, the different forms of dynamically changing DE with an effective equation of state (EoS), \u03c9 = p/\u03c1 < \u22121/3,\nwere proposed instead of the constant vacuum energy density. Other possible\nforms of DE include quintessence (\u03c9 > \u22121) (Steinhardt et al. 1999), phantom\n(\u03c9 < \u22121) (Caldwell 2002) etc. While the the possibility \u03c9 << \u22121 is ruled out\nby current cosmological data from SN Ia (Supernovae Legacy Survey, Gold sample of Hubble Space Telescope) (Riess et al. 2006; Astier et al. 2006), CMBR\n(WMAP, BOOMERANG) (Eisentein et al. 2005; MacTavish et al. 2006) and\nlarge scale structure (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) data (Komatsu et al. 2009),\nthe dynamically evolving DE crossing the phantom divide line (PDL) (\u03c9 = \u22121)\nis mildly favored. Some other limits obtained from observational results coming from SNe Ia data (Knop et al 2003) and combination of SNe Ia data with\nCMBR anisotropy and galaxy clustering statistics (Tegmark et al. 2004) are\n\u22121.67 < \u03c9 < \u22120.62 and \u22121.33 < \u03c9 < \u22120.79, respectively. The latest results\nin 2009, obtained after a combination of cosmological data-sets coming from\nCMB anisotropies, luminosity distances of high red-shift type Ia supernovae\nand galaxy clustering, constrain the dark energy EoS to \u22121.44 < \u03c9 < \u22120.92 at\n68% confidence level (Komatsu et al. 2009; Hinshaw et al. 2009)\nMoreover, in recent years Bianchi universes have been gaining an increasing interest of observational cosmology, since the WMAP data (Hinshaw et al.\n2003, 2007; Jaffe et al. 2005) seem to require an addition to the standard cosmological model with positive cosmological constant that resembles the Bianchi\nmorphology (Jaffe et al. 2006a, 2006b; Campanelli et al. 2006, 2007; Hoftuft et\nal. 2009). According to this, the universe should achieve a slightly anisotropic\nspecial geometry in spite of the inflation, contrary to generic inflationary models\nand that might be indicating a nontrivial isotropization history of universe due\nto the presence of an anisotropic energy source. The Bianchi models isotropize\nat late times even for ordinary matter, and the possible anisotropy of the Bianchi\nmetrics necessarily dies away during the inflationary era (Ellis 2006). In fact\nthis isotropization of the Bianchi metrics is due to the implicit assumption that\nthe DE is isotropic in nature. Therefore, the CMB anisotropy can also be fine\ntuned, since the Bianchi universe anisotropies determine the CMB anisotropies.\nThe price of this property of DE is a voilation of null energy condition (NEC)\nsince the DE crosses the phantom divide line (PDL), in particular depending\non the direction.\nThe anomalies found in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large\n2\n\n\fscale structure observations stimulated a growing interest in anisotropic cosmological model of universe. Here we confine ourselves to models of Bianchi-type\nII. Bianchi type-II space-time has a fundamental role in constructing cosmological models suitable for describing the early stages of evolution of universe.\nAsseo and Sol (1987) emphasized the importance of Bianchi type-II Universe.\nRecently Pradhan et al (2011) and Kumar and Akarsu (2011) have dealt with\nBianchi-II DE models by considering the spatial law of variation of Hubble's parameter which yields the constant value of deceleration parameter (DP). Some\nauthors (Akarsu and Kilinc 2010a, 2010b; Yadav et al. 2011; Yadav and Yadav\n2011; Kumar and Yadav 2011; Yadav 2011; Adhav et al. 2011 and recently\nYadav and Saha 2011) have studied DE models with variable EoS parameter.\nIn this paper, we presented general relativistic cosmological model with time dependent DP in LRS Bianchi-II space-time which can be described by isotropic\nand variable EoS parameter. The paper is organized as follows: The metric and\nfield equation are presented in section 2. Section 3 deals with the solution of\nfield equations and physical behavior of the model. Finally the findings of paper\nare discussed in section 4.\n\n2\n\nThe metric and field equations\n\nThe gravitational field in our case is given by a Bianchi type-II (BII) metric\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a21 (dx1 \u2212 x3 dx2 )2 + a22 dx22 + a23 dx23 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwith a1 , a2 , a3 being the functions of time only. In what follows, we consider\nthe LRS BII model setting a2 = a3 .\nGiven the fact that the dark energy is isotropically distributed, it is enough to\nconsider only three Einstein equations (Saha 2011) corresponding to the metric\n(1), namely\n\u00e42 \u0010 \u02272 \u00112\n+\n\u2212\na2\na2\n\u00e41\n\u00e42\n\u02271 \u02272\n+\n+\n+\na1\na2\na1 a2\n\u02271 \u02272 \u0010 \u02272 \u00112\n+\n\u2212\n2\na1 a2\na2\n2\n\n3 a21\n4 a42\n1 a21\n4 a42\n1 a21\n4 a42\n\n= \u2212\u03c9\u03c1,\n\n(2a)\n\n= \u2212\u03c9\u03c1,\n\n(2b)\n\n= \u03c1.\n\n(2c)\n\nHere over dots denote differentiation with respect to time (t).\nLet us introduce a new function\n\u221a\nV = a1 a22 = \u2212g.\n\n(3)\n\nThe expressions for expansion and shear for BII metric given by (1) read:\n\u03b8 = u\u03bc;\u03bc = \u0393\u03bc\u03bc0 =\n3\n\na \u03072\nV\u0307\na \u03071\n+2 = ,\na1\na2\nV\n\n(4)\n\n\fand\n\u03c311 =\n\n\u02271\n1\n\u2212 \u03b8,\na1\n3\n\n\u03c322 = \u03c333 =\n\n1\n\u02272\n\u2212 \u03b8,\na2\n3\n\n\u03c321 = z\n\nh \u0227\n\n1\n\na1\n\n\u2212\n\n\u02272\nz 2 a1 \u02271 i\n.\n+\na2\na22\n\n(5)\n\nLet us now define the generalized and directional Hubble parameters. As in\nknow, the Hubble parameter was defined by E. Hubble for the FRW model\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a2 (dx21 + dx22 + dx23 ),\n(6)\n\u221a\n. Taking into account that \u2212g = a3 it can be defined as H =\nas H = a1 da\n\u221a dt\n\u221a\nd gii\n\u2212g\nd\n1 \u221a1\n\u221a1\nor Hi =\n3 \u2212g dt , and the directional Hubble parameters as Hi =\ngii dt\n1 1 dgii\n2 gii dt .\n\n\u221a\nTaking into account that for BII metric (1) \u2212g = a1 a2 a3 = a1 a22 = V and\ng11 = a21 , g22 = x23 a21 + a22 and g33 = a23 , analogically we define\nH1 =\n\n\u02271\n,\na1\n\nx23 a1 \u02271 + a2 \u02272\n,\nx23 a21 + a22\n\nH2 =\n\nH3 =\n\n\u02272\na2\n\n(7)\n\nand\n\u02272 \u0001\n1 \u02271\n1 V\u0307\n+2\n=\n.\n(8)\n3V\n3 a1\na2\nIt should be noted that though for a2 = a1 we have H1 = H2 = H3 as in isotropic\ncase, the present definition does not lead to H = (H1 + H2 + H3 )/3. For this\nequality to held, one must set H2 = a\u022722 . Unfortunately, there is no unique\ndefinition for directional Hubble parameters. Finally we define the deceleration\nparameter (DP) as\nV V\u0308\n.\n(9)\nq=\u2212\nV\u0307 2\nImposing the proportionality condition, i.e., assuming that the expansion \u03b8\nis proportional to say \u03c311 :\n\u03b8 \u221d \u03c311 ,\n(10)\nH=\n\none finds the following relations between the metric functions\na2 = an1 ,\n\n(11)\n\nwith n being some constant. Inserting (11) into (3) we obtain\na1 = V 1/(2n+1) ,\n\na2 = V n/(2n+1) ,\n\n(12)\n\nSubtraction of (2b) from (2a) gives\n\u00e41\n\u02272 \u00012 \u02271 \u02272\na2\n\u00e42\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212 14 = 0.\n\u2212\na2\na1\na2\na1 a2\na2\n\n(13)\n\nInserting a1 and a2 from (12) into (13) we find equation for defining V :\nV\u0308 =\n\n2n + 1 (3\u22122n)/(1+2n)\nV\n,\nn\u22121\n4\n\n(14)\n\n\fwith the solution in quadrature\nZ\ndV\n2n + 1\n\u221a\nt.\n=p\n4/(2n+1)\n2(n \u2212 1)\nV\n+C\n\n(15)\n\nEq. (15) imposes some restriction on the choice of n, namely, n > 1. Thus we see\nthat the proportionality condition (10) in our case does not allow isotropization\nof the initially anisotropic space-time.\nOnce V is defined, we can define DP from (9) and EoS parameter from\n\u03c9\n\n4(n + 1)(2n + 1)V V\u0308 \u2212 4(n2 + 2n)V\u0307 2 + (2n + 1)2 V 4/(2n+1)\n4(n2 + 2n)V\u0307 2 \u2212 (2n + 1)2 V 4/(2n+1)\n\n=\n\n\u2212\n\n=\n\n1\u2212\n\n4(n2\n\n4(n + 1)(2n + 1)V V\u0308\n+ 2n)V\u0307 2 \u2212 (2n + 1)2 V 4/(2n+1)\n\n(16)\n\nThus we see that V plays central role here in defining all physical quantities. In\nwhat follows we find V from (14) or (15) for some concrete values of n or C.\n\n3\n\nSolution of field equations\n\nOne can not solve equation (15) in general. So, in order to solve the problem\ncompletely, we have to choose either C or n in such a manner that equation\n(15) be integrable. The easiest way is to set C = 0 in (15). In that case one\ndully obtains\nV = C0 t(2n+1)/(2n\u22121) ,\n\nC0 =\n\nh\n\ni(2n+1)/(2n\u22121)\n(2n + 1)2\np\n.\n(2n \u2212 1) 2(n \u2212 1)\n\n(17)\n\nAs one sees, in this case V is an increasing function of time, but this solution\nleads to the constant DP.\nSince, we are looking for a model explaining an expanding universe with\nacceleration, we consider the case for nontrivial C, which for a suitable choice\nof n gives the time dependent DP. The motivation for time dependent DP is\nbehind the fact that the universe is accelerated expansion at present as observed\nin recent observations of Type Ia supernova (Riess et al. 1998, 2004; Perlmutter\net al. 1999; Tonry et al. 2003; Clocchiatti et al. 2006) and CMB anisotropies\n(Bennett et al. 2003; de Bernardis et al. 2000; Hanany et al. 2000) and decelerated expansion in the past. Also, the transition redshift from deceleration\nexpansion to accelerated expansion is about 0.5. Now for a Universe which\nwas decelerating in past and accelerating at the present time, the DP must\nshow signature flipping (see Padmanabhan and Roychowdhury 2003; Amendola\n2003; Riess et al. 2001). So, there is no scope for a constant DP at present\nepoch. So, in general, the DP is not a constant but time variable.\nThus we consider the Eq. (15) with a nontrivial C. For C 6= 0 Eq. (15)\nallows exact solution only when 4/(2n + 1) = N , where N is an integer number.\n5\n\n\fIn this case N can be integer only for n = 1/2 and n = 3/2. Since n > 1 we\nhave only one option left, it is to choose n = 3/2. In this case Eq. (15) reduces\nto\nZ\ndV\n\u221a\n= 4t\n(18)\nV +C\nwhich after integration leads\nV = 4t2 + 2\u03b2t + \u03b3\nwhere \u03b2 is the integrating constant and \u03b3 =\nInserting equation (20) into (12), we obtain\n\n\u03b22\n4\n\n(19)\n\n\u2212C\n1\n\na1 = (4t2 + 2\u03b2t + \u03b3) 4\n\n(20)\n\n3\n\na2 = (4t2 + 2\u03b2t + \u03b3) 8\n\n(21)\n\nThe physical parameters such as directional Hubble's parameters (H1 , H2 , H3 ),\naverage Hubble parameter (H), expansion scalar (\u03b8) and scale factor (a) are,\nrespectively given by\n4t + \u03b2\nH1 =\n(22)\n2\n2(4t + 2\u03b2t + \u03b3)\nH2 =\n\n(4t + \u03b2)(x23 + 12t2 + 6\u03b2t + 3\u03b3)\n2(4t2 + 2\u03b2t + \u03b3)(x23 + 4t2 + 2\u03b2t + \u03b3)\n\n(23)\n\nH3 =\n\n3(4t + \u03b2)\n4(4t2 + 2\u03b2t + \u03b3)\n\n(24)\n\nH=\n\n2(4t + \u03b2)\n3(4t2 + 2\u03b2 + \u03b3)\n\n(25)\n\n\u03b8=\n\n2(4t + \u03b2)\n(4t2 + 2\u03b2 + \u03b3)\n\n(26)\n\n1\n\na = (4t2 + 2\u03b2t + \u03b3) 3\n\n(27)\n\nThe components of shear scalar are given by\n4t + \u03b2\n,\n+ 2\u03b2t + \u03b3)\n4t + \u03b2\n\u03c322 = \u03c333 =\n,\n2\n12(4t + 2\u03b2t + \u03b3)\nx33 (4t + \u03b2)\nx3 (4t + \u03b2)\n\u03c321 =\n5 \u2212\n2\n4(4t2 + 2\u03b2t + \u03b3)\n4(4t + 2\u03b2t + \u03b3) 4\n\u03c311 = \u2212\n\n6(4t2\n\n(28)\n(29)\n(30)\n\nThe value of DP (q) is found to be\nq=\u2212 h\n2 1+\n\n1\nC\n4t2 +2\u03b2t+\u03b3\n\n6\n\n1\ni =\u2212 \u0002\n2 1+\n\nC\na3\n\n\u0003\n\n(31)\n\n\f0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\nq\n\n0\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.3\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nt\nFigure 1: Plot of deceleration parameter (q) versus time (t).\n\n0\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.6\n\n\u03c9\n\n\u22120.8\n\u22121\n\u22121.2\n\u22121.4\n\u22121.6\n\u22121.8\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5 6 6.5 7 7.5 8 8.5 9 9.5 10\n\nt\nFigure 2: Plot of EoS parameter (\u03c9) versus time (t).\n\n7\n\n\fThe sign of q indicates whether the model inflates or not. A positive sign of\nq corresponds to the standard decelerating model whereas the negative sign of\nq indicates indicates inflation. The recent observations of SN Ia (Riess et al.\n1998, Perlmutter et al. 1999) reveal that the present universe is accelerating\nand the value of DP lies somewhere in the range \u22121 < q < 0. Figure 1 depicts\nthe variation of DP versus cosmic time as representative case with appropriate\nchoice of constants of integration and other physical parameters.\nThe energy density of the cosmic fluid (\u03c1), EoS parameter (\u03c9) and density\nparameter (\u03a9) are found to be\n\u03c1=\n\n21(4t + \u03b2)2\n1\n\u2212\n16(4t2 + 2\u03b2t + \u03b3)2\n4(4t2 + 2\u03b2t + \u03b3)\n\n(32)\n\n320(4t2 + 2\u03b2t + \u03b3)\n21(8t + 2\u03b2)2 \u2212 16(4t2 + 2\u03b2t + \u03b3)\n\n(33)\n\n\u03c9 =1\u2212\n\n\u03a9=\n\n63 3(4t2 + 2\u03b2t + \u03b3)\n\u2212\n64\n16(4t + \u03b2)2\n\n(34)\n\nFrom Eq.

This singularity is point type because the directional scale factors a1 (t) and a2 (t) vanish\nat initial moment. The components of shear scalar vanish at t \u2192 \u221e. Thus in\nderived model the initial anisotropy dies out at later time.\n\nFigure 2 depicts the variation EoS parameter (\u03c9) versus cosmic time as representative case with appropriate choice of constants of integration and other\nphysical parameters. It is shown that the growth of \u03c9 takes place with negative\nsign. It should be emphasized that there is a number of models for dark energy\n(quintessence, Chaplygin gas, phantom and many more) and quest for the right\none is still going on. The main idea for the DE is a negative pressure, so one can\ntry with a negative EoS parameter. It should be noted that the quintessence is\ngiven by a barotropic EoS only with negative parameter. We don't call fluid a\nDE, we just construct DE in analogy with fluid.

Under some specific choice of problem parameters the present\nconsideration yields the variable DP and EoS parameter. It is to be noted that\nour procedure of solving the field equations are altogether different from what\nPradhan et al (2011) have adapted. Pradhan et al (2011) have solved the field\nequations by considering the variation law for generalized Hubble's parameter\nwhich gives the constant value of DP and only the evolution takes place either\nin accelerating or decelerating phase whereas we have considered the proportionality condition \u03b8 \u221d \u03c311 in such a way that gives variable DP which evolves\nfrom decelerating phase to current accelerating phase (see Fig. 1). Thus the\npresent DE model has transition of universe from the early deceleration phase to\ncurrent acceleration phase which is in good agreement with recent observations\n(2006). The model has singular origin and the universe is ultimately filled with\ndust only at remote future.\nThe theoretical arguments suggest and observational data show, the universe\n\n9\n\n\fwas anisotropic at the early stage. Here we are dealing not only with the present\nstate of the universe, but drawing a picture of the universe from the remote past\nto present day. We use the Bianchi model as one of many models able to describe\ninitial anisotropy that dies away as the universe evolves. So though the model\nis anisotropic in the past for small t but it becomes isotropic as t \u2192 \u221e. In the\nderived model, the EoS parameter (\u03c9) is evolving with negative sign which may\nbe attributed to the current accelerated expansion of universe. Hence from the\ntheoretical perspective, the present model can be a viable model to explain the\nlate time acceleration of the universe. In other words, the solution presented\nhere can be one of the potential candidates to describe the present universe as\nwell as the early universe.\n\nAcknowledgments\nOne of authors (AKY) is thankful to The Institute of Mathematical Science\n(IMSc), Chennai, India for providing facility and support where part of this\nwork was carried out.
