Why is the Four Vertex Theorem true?\n1. A simple construction.\nA counter-example would be a simple closed curve in the plane whose curvature\nis nonconstant, has one minimum and one maximum, and is weakly monotonic\non the two arcs between them. We will try to build such a curve from a few arcs\nof circles, fail, and see why. Consider the figure below.\n\nThink of the circles above as train tracks. Our curve will be traced out by a train\nwhich travels along these circular tracks, switching from one to another at the\nlabeled junction points.\nLet the train start at point 1 on the bottom of the largest circle, giving the minimum\ncurvature there. It then moves off to the right along this large circle, comes to the\npoint 2, and switches there to a smaller circle, increasing its curvature.\nThe important thing to note is that the vertical diameter of this smaller circle is\ndisplaced to the right of the vertical diameter of the original circle.\nTo keep things brief, we let the train stay on this second circle until it comes to the\ntop at the point 3, which is to the right of the vertical diameter of the original circle.\n\n2\n\n\fThen we go back to the beginning, start the train once again at the bottom of the\noriginal circle, relabel this point 1' , and now let the train move off to the left. It\nswitches to a smaller circle at point 2', and comes to the top of this circle at 3',\nwhich is now to the left of the vertical diameter of the original circle.\nIf the curved path of the train is to form a convex simple closed curve, then the top\npoints 3 and 3' should coincide...but they don't. So the curve does not exist.\nNo matter how many circles we use, we get the same contradiction: the curve\ncan not close up while staying simple, and therefore does not exist.\nBut if we permit a self-intersection, then it's easy to get just one maximum and one\nminimum for the curvature.\n\nThe equation of the above curve in polar coordinates is r = - 1 - 2 sin \u03b8 .\nThe curvature takes its minimum value of 5/9 at the bottom of the big loop, its\nmaximum value of 3 at the bottom of the small loop, and is monotonic in between.\n\n3\n\n\fII. Osserman's proof of the Four Vertex Theorem.\n2. Consider the circumscribed circle.\nIn 1985, Robert Osserman gave a simple proof of the Four Vertex Theorem in\nwhich all cases, strictly positive or mixed positive and negative curvature, are\ntreated on an equal footing. At the beginning of his paper, Osserman says,\n\"The essence of the proof may be distilled in a single phrase:\nconsider the circumscribed circle.\"\nLet E be a fixed nonempty compact set in the plane. Among all circles C which\nenclose E , there is a unique smallest one, the circumscribed circle.\n\nWhat can C \u2229 E look like ?\n(1) C must meet E , otherwise C could be made smaller and still enclose E .\n(2) C \u2229 E can not lie in an open semi-circle. Otherwise we could shift C a bit,\nwithout changing its size, so that the new C still encloses E but does not meet it.\nBut this would contradict (1).\n(3) Thus C \u2229 E has at least two points, and if only these, then they must be\nantipodal. This happens when E is an ellipse.\n\n4\n\n\f3. An overview of Osserman's proof.\nOSSERMAN'S THEOREM. Let \u03b1 be a simple closed curve of class C2 in the\nplane, and C the circumscribed circle. If \u03b1 \u2229 C has at least n components,\nthen \u03b1 has at least 2n vertices.\nHere are the major steps in the proof.\n(1) Let R be the radius of the circumscribed circle C , and K = 1/R its curvature.\nIf \u03b1 \u2229 C has at least n components, then \u03b1 has at least n vertices where the\ncurvature \u03ba satisfies \u03ba \u2265 K , and at least n more vertices where \u03ba < K .\nCaution. We do not claim that the six points shown in the figure below are vertices.\nBut if you find six consecutive points on the curve \u03b1 where the curvature goes up\nand down as shown, then you can replace them by six vertices of \u03b1 , three of them\nlocal maxima and three local minima. We leave it to the reader to check this simple\nassertion.\n\nIt is clear from this picture how we get the n points where \u03ba \u2265 K .\nTo get the ones inbetween, where \u03ba < K , we proceed as follows.\n5\n\n\fLet P1 , P2 , ..., Pn be n points in counterclockwise order on the circle C ,\none from each component of C \u2229 \u03b1 . Since C \u2229 \u03b1 cannot lie in an open\nsemi-circle, we can choose these points so that the arc of C from each point\nto the next is no larger than a semi-circle.\nNow focus on the arc C1 of C from P1 to P2 , and on the corresponding arc \u03b11\nof the curve \u03b1 . We have arranged for the convenience of description that the\nline connecting P1 and P2 is vertical.\nThe arc \u03b11 of \u03b1 is tangent to C at P1 and P2 , and does not lie entirely along C .\nIt therefore contains a point Q which is not on C1 , yet lies to the right of the\nvertical line connecting P1 and P2 . Consider the circle C' through P1 , Q and P2 .\n\nSince Q is in the interior of C , and since C1 is no larger than a semicircle, it\nfollows that the circle C' is larger than C . Hence its curvature K' < K .\n\n6\n\n\fNow gradually translate the circle C' to the left, until it last touches \u03b11 at the\npoint Q1 .\n\nAt Q1 , the curvature \u03ba of \u03b1 must satisfy \u03ba(Q1) \u2264 K' < K , which is exactly\nwhat we wanted to show.\n\n7\n\n\f(2) Bonus clause. The components of \u03b1 \u2229 C are either single points or closed\narcs. For each component which is an arc rather than a single point, we can get\ntwo extra vertices, over and above the 2n vertices promised by Osserman's\ntheorem.\nThe picture of \u03b1 below is roughly the same as before, but we have distorted it\nso that an entire arc of \u03b1 about the point P2 coincides with an arc of the circle C .\nThe curvature of \u03b1 at P2 is now exactly \u03ba . But in addition, there must be points\nof \u03b1 to either side of this arc, arbitrarily close to it, where the curvature \u03ba of \u03b1\nis > K . Two such points are shown in the figure, and marked R2 and R2' .\nAs a result, the point P2 , where the curvature of \u03b1 used to be larger than the\ncurvature at the two neighboring marked points, has been demoted, and the\ncurvature of \u03b1 at P2 is now less than that at the two neighboring marked points.\nIn this way, we have gained two extra vertices for \u03b1 .\n\n(3) It can happen that \u03b1 \u2229 C has only one component, which must then be a\nclosed arc on C greater than or equal to a semi-circle. Osserman's theorem\npromises that \u03b1 has at least two vertices, and the bonus clause promises two\nmore.\n(4) Thus Osserman's theorem, together with the bonus clause, yields the Four\nVertex Theorem.\n8\n\n\fIII. The converse in the case of strictly positive curvature.\nFULL CONVERSE TO THE FOUR VERTEX THEOREM. Let \u03ba: S1 \u2192 R\nbe a continuous function which is either a nonzero constant or else has at least\ntwo local maxima and two local minima. Then there is an embedding \u03b1: S1 \u2192 R2\nwhose curvature at the point \u03b1(t) is \u03ba(t) for all t \u220a S1 .\n\n4. Basic idea of the proof for strictly positive curvature.\nWe use a winding number argument in the group of diffeomorphisms of the circle,\nas follows.\nLet \u03ba: S1 \u2192 R be any continuous strictly positive curvature function, and for the\nmoment think of the parameter along S1 as the angle of inclination \u03b8 of the\ndesired curve. Since this curve will usually not close up, it is better to cut S1 open\ninto the interval [0, 2\u03c0] .\nThere is a unique map \u03b1: [0, 2\u03c0] \u2192 R2 which begins at the origin and has unit\ntangent vector (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8) and curvature \u03ba(\u03b8) at the point \u03b1(\u03b8) . In fact, if s\nis arc length along this curve, then the equations\nd\u03b1/ds = (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8)\n\nand\n\nd\u03b8/ds = \u03ba(\u03b8)\n\nquickly lead to the explicit formula\n\u03b8\n\n\u03b1(\u03b8) = \u222b0 (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8) d\u03b8 / \u03ba(\u03b8) .\n\n9\n\n\fThe error vector E = \u03b1(2\u03c0) - \u03b1(0) measures the failure of our curve to\nclose up.\n\nIf the curvature function \u03ba has at least two local maxima and two local minima,\nwe will show how to find a loop of diffeomorphisms h of the circle so that when\nwe construct, as above, curves \u03b1h: [0, 2\u03c0] \u2192 R2 whose curvature at the point \u03b1h(\u03b8)\nis \u03ba \u25e6 h(\u03b8) , the corresponding error vectors E(h) will wind once around the origin.\nFurthermore, we will do this so that the loop is contractible in the group Diff(S 1) of\ndiffeomorphisms of the circle, and conclude that for some h \"inside\" this loop, the\ncurve \u03b1h will have error vector E(h) = 0 , and hence close up to form a smooth\nsimple closed curve.\nIts curvature at the point \u03b1h(\u03b8) is \u03ba \u25e6 h(\u03b8) , so if we write \u03b1h(\u03b8) = \u03b1h \u25e6 h-1 \u25e6 h(\u03b8) ,\nand let h(\u03b8) = t , then its curvature at the point \u03b1h \u25e6 h-1(t) is \u03ba(t) . Therefore\n\u03b1 = \u03b1h \u25e6 h-1 is a reparametrization of the same curve, whose curvature at the\npoint \u03b1(t) is \u03ba(t) .\n\n10\n\n\f5. How do we find such a loop of diffeomorphisms?\nThe first step is to replace \u03ba by a simpler curvature function.\nUsing the hypothesis that \u03ba has at least two local maxima and two local minima,\nwe find positive numbers 0 < a < b such that \u03ba takes the values a , b , a , b at\nfour points in order around the circle. We then find a preliminary diffeomorphism\nh1 of the circle so that the function \u03ba \u25e6 h1 is \u03b5-close in measure to a step function\n\u03ba0 with values a , b , a , b on four successive arcs of length \u03c0/2 each, in the sense\nthat \u03ba \u25e6 h1 is within \u03b5 of \u03ba0 on almost all of S1 , except on a set of measure < \u03b5 .\n\nIf the curvature functions \u03ba \u25e6 h1 and \u03ba0 are \u03b5-close in measure, then the corresponding curves are easily seen to be C1-close. With this in mind, we will focus\nattention on the curvature step function \u03ba0 and ignore the original curvature\nfunction \u03ba until almost the end of the argument.\nGiven this shift of attention, we next find a contractible loop of diffeomorphisms h\nof the circle so that the error vectors E(h) for the curvature step functions \u03ba0 \u25e6 h\nwind once around the origin, as in the picture below.\n\n11\n\n\fA curve tries unsuccessfully to close up\n\n12\n\n\f6. How do we read this picture?\nThe picture has eight portions, located at the eight points of the compass.\nEach contains a small circle which shows a curvature step function \u03ba0 \u25e6 h , and a\nlarger curve which realizes it, with common parameter the angle of inclination \u03b8 .\nThis larger curve is built from four circular arcs, two cut from a circle of curvature a\nand two from a circle of curvature b . Heavier markings indicate the larger circle.\nThe curves fail to close up, and we show their error vectors. The figures are arranged\nso that the one in the east has an error vector pointing east, the one in the northeast\nhas an error vector pointing northeast, and so on.\nThe eight diffeomorphisms h are samples from a loop of diffeomorphisms of the\ncircle, and the corresponding error vectors E(h) wind once around the origin. The\nloop is contractible in Diff(S1) because each diffeomorphism leaves the bottom point\nof the circle fixcd. The precise description of such a family of diffeomorphisms of the\ncircle is given in Gluck (1971), but we think there is enough information in the above\npicture for the reader to work out the details. This picture can be seen in animated\nform at our website, www.math.upenn.edu/~deturck/fourvertex.\nSince the loop of diffeomorphisms is contractible in Diff(S1) , it follows that for\nsome other diffeomorphism h of the circle, the corresponding curve with curvature\n\u03ba0 \u25e6 h has error vector zero, and therefore closes up. This is hardly news: if h is the\nidentity, then the curve with curvature \u03ba0 closes up, as shown below.\n\nPreassign \u03ba0\n\nGet this \"bicircle\"\n\nBut the point is that the above argument is robust, and hence applies equally well to\nthe curvature function \u03ba \u25e6 h1 which is \u03b5-close in measure to \u03ba0 , since the corresponding curves are C1-close. Hence there must also be a diffeomorphism h of the\ncircle so that the curve with curvature \u03ba \u25e6 h1 \u25e6 h has error vector zero, and therefore\ncloses up to form a strictly convex simple closed curve. Reparametrizing this curve as\nin section 4 shows that it realizes the preassigned curvature function \u03ba , completing\nthe proof of the converse to the Four Vertex Theorem for strictly positive curvature.\n13\n\n\f7. Why does this argument sound familiar?\nProving something that is obvious by using a robust argument reminds us of the\nproof that the polynomial p0(z) = an zn has a zero by noting that it takes any circle\nin the complex plane to a curve which winds n times around the origin. After all,\nit is obvious that p0(z) has a zero at the origin.\nBut this argument is also robust, and applies equally well to the polynomial\np(z) = an zn + an-1 zn-1 + ... + a1 z + a0 ,\nwhen z moves around a suitably large circle, giving us the usual topological proof\nof the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.\n\n8. Where does our winding number argument come from?\nHere is a higher-dimensional result proved in Gluck (1972).\nGENERALIZED MINKOWSKI THEOREM. Let K: Sn \u2192 R , for n \u2265 2 ,\nbe a continuous, strictly positive function. Then there exists an embedding\n\u03b1: Sn \u2192 Rn+1 onto a closed convex hypersurface whose Gaussian curvature\nat the point \u03b1(p) is K(p) for all p \u220a Sn .\nThe proof of this theorem is by a degree argument in the diffeomorphism group\nof the n-sphere Sn . The hypothesis that n \u2265 2 is used to guarantee the existence\nof a diffeomorphism which arbitrarily permutes any finite number of points. This\nhypothesis fails for n = 1 , but when we rewrite the argument in this case, we get\nthe winding number proof of the converse to the Four Vertex Theorem for strictly\npositive curvature described above.\n\n14\n\n\f9. Building curves from arcs of circles.\nBefore we leave this section, we record the following observation of Dahlberg, and\nsave it for later use.\nPROPOSITION 9.1. A plane curve, built with four arcs cut in alternation from\ntwo different size circles, and assembled so that the tangent line turns continuously\nthrough an angle of 2\u03c0 , will close up if and only if opposite arcs are equal in length.\nEvidence for this proposition is provided by the preceding figure of a bicircle,\nand the large figure before that, containing eight separate curves which fail to\nclose up.\nProof. We parametrize such a curve by the angle of inclination \u03b8 of its tangent line,\nsuppose that 0 < a < b are the curvatures of the two circles to be used, and record\nthe curvature function \u03ba(\u03b8) in the figure below.\n\n15\n\n\fIf \u03b1(\u03b8) is the resulting curve, then its error vector is given by\nE = \u03b1(2\u03c0) - \u03b1(0) = \u222b02\u03c0 ei\u03b8 ds = \u222b02\u03c0 ei\u03b8 ds/d\u03b8 d\u03b8 = \u222b02\u03c0 ei\u03b8 / \u03ba(\u03b8) d\u03b8 .\nWe evaluate this explicitly as a sum of four integrals, and get\nE = (1/ia - 1/ib) ( [exp(i\u03b82) - exp(i\u03b81)] + [exp(i\u03b84) - exp(i\u03b83)] ) .\nWe are left with the question of whether the two vectors shown below add up to\nzero.\n\nThe picture makes the answer obvious and proves the proposition.\n\n16\n\n\fIV. Dahlberg's proof of the Full Converse to the Four Vertex Theorem.\n10. Dahlberg's key idea.\nWhen asked to draw a simple closed curve in the plane with strictly positive\ncurvature, and another one with mixed positive and negative curvature,\na typical response might be...\n\nBut for mixed positive and negative curvature, Dahlberg envisioned the following\ncurve.\n\nIts four major subarcs are almost circular. They are connected by four small wiggly\narcs, each of which has an almost constant tangent direction, but largely varying\ncurvature, including negative curvature. This curve \"marginalizes\" its negative\ncurvature and emphasizes its positive curvature, and from a distance looks like a\nbicircle.\nDahlberg's Key Idea. You can construct such a curve with any preassigned\ncurvature which has at least two local maxima and two local minima. You can\nuse the winding number argument to get it to close up smoothly, and you can\nalso make it C1 close to a fixed convex curve, which will imply that it is simple.\n\n17\n\n\f11. Dahlberg's proof plan.\nThe overall plan is to follow the winding number line of argument from the strictly\npositive curvature case, preserving the prominent role played by two-valued curvature step functions, but mindful of the need for the following changes.\n(1) A smooth simple closed curve with strictly positive curvature has a distinguished\nparametrization by the angle of inclination of its tangent line. This doesn't work in\ngeneral, so another parametrization scheme is needed.\n(2) A smooth closed curve with strictly positive curvature whose tangent line turns\nthrough an angle of 2\u03c0 is automatically simple. This is false in general, and part\nof Dahlberg's Key Idea is to force the curve to be C1 close to a fixed convex curve\nin order to make it simple.\nTo accomplish this, he exhibits a 2-cell D in Diff(S1) , centered at the identity,\nand satisfying a certain transversality condition which guarantees that the winding\nnumber argument will work using arbitrarily small loops in D about its center.\n\n18\n\n\f12. Finding the right parametrization.\nChoose, as common domain for all our curves, the unit circle S1 with arc length s\nas parameter. Since most of the curves will fail to close up, cut the circle open at\nthe point (1,0) and think of the interval [0, 2\u03c0] as the domain. All the curves will\nhave length 2\u03c0 , and at the end will be scaled up or down to modify their curvature.\nWe make sure the total curvature is always 2\u03c0 as follows. Given a preassigned\ncurvature function \u03ba: S1 \u2192 R which is not identically zero, evaluate \u222b02\u03c0 \u03ba(s) ds .\nIf this is zero, precede \u03ba by a preliminary diffeomorphism of S1 so as to make the\nintegral nonzero, but still call the composition \u03ba . Then rescale this new \u03ba by a\nconstant c so that\n\u222b02\u03c0 c \u03ba(s) ds = 2\u03c0 .\nWhen we later modify this curvature function by another diffeomorphism\nh: S1 \u2192 S1 , we will rescale the new curvature function \u03ba \u25e6 h by a constant ch\nso that the total curvature is again 2\u03c0 :\n\u222b02\u03c0 ch \u03ba \u25e6 h(s) ds = 2\u03c0 .\nWe then build a curve \u03b1h: [0, 2\u03c0] \u2192 R2 parametrized by arc length which begins\nat the origin, \u03b1h(0) = (0, 0) , starts off in the direction of the positive x-axis,\n\u03b1h'(0) = (1, 0) , and whose curvature at the point \u03b1h(s) is ch \u03ba \u25e6 h(s) .\nThe curve \u03b1h is uniquely determined by these requirements.\nThe effect of these arrangements is that all our curves begin and end up pointing\nhorizontally to the right. If any such curve closes up, it does so smoothly. Thus,\njust as in the positive curvature case, the emphasis is on getting the curve to close up.\nAt the end, using ideas expressed above, we will make sure the final curve is simple.\n\n19\n\n\f13. Configuration space.\nDefining a configuration space of four ordered points on a circle will help us\nvisualize the arguments to come, and aid us in carrying out the transversality\narguments mentioned in the proof plan.\nAs in the positive curvature case, we use the hypothesis that \u03ba has at least two\nlocal maxima and two local minima to find positive numbers 0 < a < b so that\n\u03ba takes the values a , b , a , b at four points in order around the circle. The only\ndifference here is that we might first have to change the sign of \u03ba to accomplish this.\nThen we find a preliminary diffeomorphism h1 of the circle so that the function\n\u03ba \u25e6 h1 is \u03b5-close in measure to the step function \u03ba0 with values a , b , a , b on the\narcs [0 , \u03c0/2) , [\u03c0/2 , \u03c0) , [\u03c0 , 3\u03c0/2) , [3\u03c0/2 , 2\u03c0) .\nAs before, we focus on the step function \u03ba0 and its compositions \u03ba0 \u25e6 h as h\nranges over Diff(S1) . These are all step functions with the values a , b , a , b\non the four arcs determined by some four points p1 , p2 , p3 , p4 in order on S1 .\nFor each such step function, we follow Dahlberg's parametrization scheme from\nthe previous section to construct a curve from circular arcs with curvatures\nproportional to a , b , a , b , scaled up or down to make the total curvature 2\u03c0 .\nLet E(p1 , p2 , p3 , p4) denote the error vector for this curve.\nTo think visually about all this, let CS denote the configuration space of ordered\n4-tuples (p1 , p2 , p3 , p4) of distinct points on the unit circle S1 , arranged in\ncounterclockwise order, as shown below.\n\nThe configuration space CS is diffeomorphic to S1 \u00d7 R3 .\n20\n\n\fThe error vector E(p1 , p2 , p3 , p4) defines an error map E: CS \u2192 R2 . The\nvanishing of the error vector is the signal that the curve closes up. We will call the\nset of such points the core of the configuration space CS , and denote it by CS0 .\nWe noted in Proposition 9.1 that a curve built with four arcs cut in alternation from\ntwo different size circles will close up if and only if opposite arcs are equal in\nlength.\nThus a point (p1 , p2 , p3 , p4) of CS lies in the core if and only if p1 and p3 are\nantipodal, and also p2 and p4 are antipodal. A nice exercise for the reader is to\ncheck that this condition holds if and only if the equation p1 - p2 + p3 - p4 = 0\nholds in the complex plane.\nThe core CS0 is diffeomorphic to S1 \u00d7 R1 .\n\n21\n\n\f14. Reduced configuration space.\nTo aid in visualization, and also to help with our proof of the required transversality\nresults, we define the reduced configuration space RCS \u2282 CS to be the subset\nwhere p1 = (1, 0) = 1 + 0 i = 1 . Then RCS is homeomorphic to R3 and we\nuse the group structure on S1 to express the homeomorphism S1 \u00d7 RCS \u2192 CS\nby\n\n(ei\u03b8, (1 , p , q , r)) \u2192 (ei\u03b8, ei\u03b8p , ei\u03b8q, ei\u03b8r) .\nFor the purpose of drawing pictures, we change coordinates by writing\np = e2\u03c0ix , q = e2\u03c0iy and r = e2\u03c0iz .\nThen RCS \u2245 {(x, y, z) : 0 < x < y < z < 1}.\n\nThe reduced configuration space appears as an open solid tetrahedron\n\n22\n\n\fA point (1, p, q, r) in RCS is in the core if and only if 1 and q are antipodal, and\nalso p and r are antipodal. We let RCS0 = RCS \u2229 CS0 denote the core of the\nreduced configuration space.\nIn the x, y, z coordinates for RCS , the core RCS0 is given by\n0 < x < y = 1\u20442 < z = x + 1\u20442 < 1,\nand appears as the open line segment connecting (0, 1\u20442, 1\u20442) to (1\u20442, 1\u20442, 1) .\n\nThe core of the reduced configuration space.\nThe reduced configuration space has an added advantage which derives from the\nfact that when we build curves in the plane by cutting the unit circle open at the\npoint 1 , this is already one of the four division points for an element (1, p, q, r)\nin RCS. This simplifies the construction of the curve, and the computation of its\nerror vector E(1, p, q, r) , and we make use of this in the following section.\n\n23\n\n\f15. The topology of the error map.\nThe error map E: CS \u2192 R2 takes the core CS0 to the origin, and the\ncomplement of the core to the complement of the origin.\nLet \u03bb be a loop in CS - CS0 which is null-homologous in CS but links\nthe core CS0 once. For convenience, we go down one dimension and show\nthis loop in RCS - RCS0 .\n\nAny two such loops in CS - CS0 are homotopic to one another, up to sign.\nPROPOSITION 15.1. The image of the loop \u03bb under the error map E has\nwinding number \u00b11 about the origin in R2 .\nWhat this proposition says in effect is that plane curves, built with four arcs cut in\nalternation from two different size circles, are capable of exhibiting the winding\nnumber phenomenon which makes the proof of the converse to the Four Vertex\nTheorem actually work.\n\n24\n\n\fProposition 15.1 is an immediate consequence of the transversality result below.\nPROPOSITION 15.2. The differential of the error map E: RCS \u2192 R2 is\nsurjective at each point of the core.\nProof. We are given distinct positive numbers 0 < a < b and a point\nP = (1 , p2 , p3 , p4) in RCS. Let L1 , L2 , L3 , L4 denote the lengths of the\nfour arcs 1p1 , p1p2 , p2p3 , p31 on the unit circle. Scale a and b up or down to\nnew values a(P) and b(P) , preserving their ratio, to achieve total curvature 2\u03c0 :\na(P) L1 + b(P) L2 + a(P) L3 + b(P) L4 = 2\u03c0 .\nThen construct a curve \u03b1: [0, 2\u03c0] \u2192 R2 according to Dahlberg's plan: begin\nat the origin and head in the direction of the positive x-axis along circles of\ncurvatures a(P) , b(P) , a(P) , b(P) for lengths L1 , L2 , L3 , L4 . The error vector\nE(P) = \u03b1(2\u03c0) - \u03b1(0) indicates the failure to close up.\nConsider the figure below, which shows the points 1 , p2 , p3 , p4 on the unit circle\nparametrized by arc length s , and the corresponding division points 1 , q2 , q3 , q4\non the unit circle parametrized by angle of inclination \u03b8 .\n\nangle of inclination \u03b8\n\narc length s\n\nThis momentary switch in loyalty from the arc length parameter s to the angle of\ninclination parameter \u03b8 will be rewarded by an explicit formula for the error map\nwhich makes the proof of the current proposition easy.\n\n25\n\n\fThe map\nP = (1 , p2 , p3 , p4) \u2192 Q = (1 , q2 , q3 , q4)\nis a diffeomorphism from the s-parametrized version of RCS to a \u03b8-parametrized\nversion, taking the core 1 - p2 + p3 - p4 to the core 1 - q2 + q3 - q4 .\nThis alternative version of RCS helps us to calculate the error map. First note that\nE(P) = \u222b02\u03c0 ei \u03b8(s) ds = \u222b02\u03c0 ei \u03b8 (ds/d\u03b8) d\u03b8 = \u222b02\u03c0 ei \u03b8 / \u03ba(\u03b8) d\u03b8 .\nThis can be computed explicitly as a sum of four integrals, and we get\nE(P) = (1 / i b(P) - 1 / i a(P)) (1 - q2 + q3 - q4) .\nThe differential of this map is particularly easy to compute along the core, since\nthe vanishing of the expression 1 - q2 + q3 - q4 = 0 there frees us from the\nneed to consider the rate of change of the factor (1 / i b(P) - 1 / i a(P)).\nIf we move q2 counterclockwise at unit speed along the circle, we have\ndq2/dt = i q2 , and hence\ndE/dq2 = (1 / i b(P) - 1 / i a(P)) (- i q2) .\nLikewise,\n\ndE/dq3 = (1 / i b(P) - 1 / i a(P)) ( i q3) .\n\nThese two rates of change are independent because q2 and q3 are always distinct,\nand along the core they can not be antipodal. It follows that the differential of the\nerror map is surjective at each point of the core of the \u03b8-parametrized version of\nRCS. Since the map between the two versions of RCS is a diffeomorphism\ntaking core to core, the same result holds for our original s-parametrized version of\nRCS, completing the proof of the proposition.\n\n26\n\n\f16. Dahlberg's disk D .\nDahlberg's choice of 2-cell D \u2282 Diff(S1) consists of the special M\u00f6bius\ntransformations\ng\u03b2(z) = (z - \u03b2) / (1 -\uf8e5\u03b2 z) ,\nwhere |\u03b2| < 1 and \uf8e5\u03b2 is the complex conjugate of \u03b2 .\n\nThe action of g\u03b2 on the unit disk in the complex plane\nThese special M\u00f6bius transformations are all isometries of the Poincar\u00e9 disk model\nof the hyperbolic plane. The transformation g0 is the identity, and if \u03b2 \u2260 0 , then\ng\u03b2 is a hyperbolic translation of the line through 0 and \u03b2 which takes \u03b2 to 0 and\n0 to -\u03b2 . The point \u03b2/|\u03b2| and its antipode -\u03b2/|\u03b2| on S1 (the circle at infinity) are\nthe only fixed points of g\u03b2 .\nA unit complex number ei\u03b8 acts by multiplication on the Poincar\u00e9 disk model\nof the hyperbolic plane, and as such is a hyperbolic isometry which rotates the disk\nby angle \u03b8 about its center. These rotations interact with Dahlberg's transformations\ng\u03b2 by the intertwining formula\ngei\u03b8\u03b2 (ei\u03b8 z) = ei\u03b8 g\u03b2 (z) .\n\n27\n\n\f17. The second transversality result.\nLet g\u03b2 be a point in Dahlberg's disk D , and P = (p1 , p2 , p3 , p4) a point in\nthe configuration space CS . We define\ng\u03b2(P) = (g\u03b2(p1) , g\u03b2(p2) , g\u03b2(p3) , g\u03b2(p4)) ,\nso that now D acts on CS .\nPROPOSITION 17.1. The evaluation map CS0 \u00d7 D \u2192 CS defined by\n(P, g\u03b2) \u2192 g\u03b2(P) is a diffeomorphism.\nProof. The evaluation map CS0 \u00d7 D \u2192 CS is smooth. To visualize it, start with\na point P = (p1 , p2 , p3 , p4) in the core CS0 and a transformation g\u03b2 in D\nwhich takes P to Q = (q1 , q2 , q3 , q4) . In the Poincar\u00e9 disk, the geodesic with\nends at p1 and p3 is a straight line through the origin, and likewise for the geodesic\nwith ends at p2 and p4 . The isometry g\u03b2 takes them to geodesics with ends at\nq1 and q3 , respectively q2 and q4 , which appear to the Euclidean eye as circular\narcs meeting the unit circle orthogonally, and intersecting one another at the point\ng\u03b2(0) = -\u03b2 .\n\n28\n\n\fVice versa, suppose we start with the point Q = (q1 , q2 , q3 , q4) in CS . Draw\nthe hyperbolic lines, that is, circles orthogonal to the boundary of the disk, with\nends at q1 and q3 , likewise q2 and q4 . The intersection point of these two\ncircular arcs varies smoothly with the four end points.\nCall this intersection point -\u03b2 . The transformation g-\u03b2 takes the point -\u03b2 to\nthe origin, and hence takes the two hyperbolic lines through -\u03b2 to lines through\nthe origin. It follows that P = g-\u03b2(Q) lies in the core CS0 , and that g\u03b2(P) = Q .\nThe association Q \u2192 (P, g\u03b2) provides a smooth inverse to the evaluation map\nCS0 \u00d7 D \u2192 CS , showing it to be a diffeomorphism.\nCOROLLARY 17.2. For each fixed point P in the core CS0 , the evaluation\nmap g\u03b2 \u2192 g\u03b2(P) is a smooth embedding of Dahlberg's disk D into CS which\nmeets the core transversally at the point P and nowhere else.\nThis follows directly from Proposition 17.1.\n\n29\n\n\f18. The image of Dahlberg's disk in the reduced configuration space.\nWe seek a concrete picture of Dahlberg's disk D in action. Recall from the preceding section that for any point P = (p1 , p2 , p3 , p4) in CS , the correspondence\ng\u03b2 \u2192 (g\u03b2(p1) , g\u03b2(p2) , g\u03b2(p3) , g\u03b2(p4))\nmaps D into CS . If we start with the point P0 = (1 , i, -1 , -i) , and then follow\nthe above map by the projection of CS to RCS , we get the correspondence\ng\u03b2 \u2192 (1, g\u03b2(1)-1g\u03b2(i) , g\u03b2(1)-1g\u03b2(-1) , g\u03b2(1)-1g\u03b2(-i))\n\n.\n\nIf we convert to xyz-coordinates so that RCS is the open solid tetrahedron introduced in section 14, then the image of D is shown below. In the picture on the left,\nthe tetrahedron has its usual position; on the right, it is rotated so as to clearly display\nthe negative curvature of the image disk.\n\nDahlberg's disk D mapped into the tetrahedron - two views\nThese computer drawn pictures of the image of D clearly show that its boundary\nlies along four of the six edges of the tetrahedron. This is a reflection of the fact\nthat as \u03b2 approaches the boundary of the unit disk, the special M\u00f6bius transformation g\u03b2 leaves the point \u03b2/|\u03b2| on the boundary circle fixed, but moves all other\npoints on the boundary circle towards the antipodal point -\u03b2/|\u03b2| . Hence the four\npoints 1, g\u03b2(1)-1g\u03b2(i) , g\u03b2(1)-1g\u03b2(-1) , g\u03b2(1)-1g\u03b2(-i) limit to at most two points.\nThis \"double degeneracy\" corresponds to edges (rather than faces) of the tetrahedron.\n\n30\n\n\f19. Dahlberg's proof.\nWe are given a continuous curvature function \u03ba: S1 \u2192 R which has at least two\nlocal maxima and two local minima, and must find an embedding \u03b1: S1 \u2192 R2\nwhose curvature at the point \u03b1(t) is \u03ba(t) for all t \u220a S1 .\nStep 1. We temporarily replace \u03ba by a curvature step function \u03ba0 ,\nto which we apply the winding number argument.\nChanging the sign of \u03ba if necessary, there are constants 0 < a < b so that\n\u03ba takes the values a , b , a , b at four points in succession along S1 . Let \u03ba0\ndenote the curvature step function which takes these same values along the four\nquarter-circles with end points at 1 , i , -1 , -i .\nGiven any \u03b5 > 0 , we can find a preliminary diffeomorphism h1 of the circle so\nthat the curvature function \u03ba \u25e6 h1 is \u03b5-close in measure to \u03ba0 . We then rescale\nboth \u03ba0 and \u03ba \u25e6 h1 to have total curvature 2\u03c0 . They will again be \u03b5-close in\nmeasure, for some new small \u03b5 .\nWe apply the winding number argument to the curvature step function \u03ba0 as follows.\nConsider the point P0 = (1, i , -1 , -i) in the core CS0 of the configuration\nspace CS , and map Dahlberg's disk D into CS by sending g\u03b2 \u2192 g\u03b2(P0) .\nBy Corollary 17.2, this evaluation map is a smooth embedding of D into CS\nwhich meets the core CS0 transversally at the point P0 and nowhere else.\nBy Proposition 15.1, each loop |\u03b2| = constant in D is sent by the composition\nD -evaluation map\u2192 CS -error map\u2192 R2\ninto a loop in R2 - origin with winding number \u00b11 about the origin.\nWe translate this conclusion into more concrete terms as follows.\nLet c(\u03b2) \u03ba0 \u25e6 g\u03b2 be the rescaling of the curvature step function \u03ba0 \u25e6 g\u03b2 which has\ntotal curvature 2\u03c0 , and let \u03b1(\u03b2) : [0, 2\u03c0] \u2192 R2 be the corresponding arc-length\nparametrized curve with this curvature function. As \u03b2 circles once around the\norigin, the corresponding loop of error vectors E(\u03b1(\u03b2)) has winding number \u00b11\nabout the origin.\n\n31\n\n\fStep 2. We transfer this winding number argument to the curvature function \u03ba .\nLet c(h1, \u03b2) \u03ba \u25e6 h1 \u25e6 g\u03b2 be the rescaling of the curvature function \u03ba \u25e6 h1 \u25e6 g\u03b2\nwhich has total curvature 2\u03c0 , and let \u03b1(h1, \u03b2) : [0, 2\u03c0] \u2192 R2 be the corresponding arc-length parametrized curve with this curvature function.\nFixing |\u03b2| , we can choose \u03b5 sufficiently small so that each curve \u03b1(h1, \u03b2) is\nC1-close to the curve \u03b1(\u03b2) constructed in Step 1. Then as \u03b2 circles once around\nthe origin, the corresponding loop of error vectors E(\u03b1(h1, \u03b2)) will also have\nwinding number \u00b11 about the origin. Note that we only need C0-close for this step.\nIt follows that there is a diffeomorphism g\u03b2' with |\u03b2'| \u2264 |\u03b2| so that E(\u03b1(h1, \u03b2')) = 0 ,\nwhich tells us that the curve \u03b1(h1, \u03b2') closes up smoothly. If |\u03b2| and \u03b5 are sufficiently small, then the closed curve \u03b1(h1, \u03b2') will be as C1-close as we like to the\nfixed bicircle with curvature c0 \u03ba0 , and will hence be simple.\nThe simple closed curve \u03b1(h1, \u03b2') realizes the curvature function c(h1, \u03b2') \u03ba \u25e6 h1 \u25e6 g\u03b2' .\nRescaling it realizes the curvature function \u03ba \u25e6 h1 \u25e6 g\u03b2' , and then reparametrizing it\nrealizes the curvature function \u03ba .\nThis completes Dahlberg's proof of the Converse to the Four Vertex Theorem.\n\n32\n\n\f20. Extensions and generalizations of the Four Vertex Theorem.\nThe Four Vertex Theorem for planar curves may be generalized in the following\nways:\n(1) by considering more general surfaces than just the Euclidean plane;\n(2) by relaxing the condition that the curve be simple;\n(3) by considering space curves; and\n(4) by seeking conditions which would ensure the existence of more than\nfour vertices.\nSome generalizations go in several of these directions at the same time.\n(1) The consideration of more general surfaces was initiated by Jackson (1945),\nwho showed that any simple closed curve which lies on a surface of constant\ncurvature in Euclidean space, and is null-homotopic on that surface, has at least\nfour vertices, meaning local maxima or local minima of the geodesic curvature.\nSee also Thorbergsson (1976).\n(2) The generalization to nonsimple curves was initiated by Pinkall (1987), who\nshowed that if a closed planar curve bounds an immersed surface in the plane, then\nit must have at least four vertices. He also pointed out that there exist closed curves\nof any rotation index which have only two vertices.\nThe generalizations of Jackson and Pinkall may be combined to show that any closed\ncurve on a complete orientable 2-manifold of constant curvature, which bounds an\nimmersed disk, has at least four vertices. See Maeda (1998) and Costa and Firer\n(2000).\n\n33\n\n\f(3) The generalization to space curves stems from the observation that stereographic\nprojection maps the vertices of a planar curve to vertices (with respect to geodesic\ncurvature) of its image on the sphere. This is a special case of the more general\nphenomenon that any conformal transformation of a surface preserves the vertices.\nOn a sphere, however, the points where the geodesic curvature vanishes correspond\nto points of vanishing torsion. Thus the fact that a spherical curve has at least four\npoints of vanishing torsion may be considered a generalization of the Four Vertex\nTheorem in the plane. Sedykh (1994) showed that this result holds for all space\ncurves which lie on the boundary of their convex hull, thus proving a conjecture of\nScherk.\n(4) The first result seeking more than four vertices is that of Osserman (1985)\ndiscussed earlier in this paper. Another generalization was initiated by Pinkall, who\nhad conjectured that if a planar curve bounds an immersed surface of genus g ,\nthen it must have 4g + 2 vertices. This was disproved by Cairns, Ozdemir and\nTjaden (1992), where the authors constructed for any genus g \u2265 1 a planar\ncurve bounding an immersed surface of genus g which has only 6 vertices.\nLater, Umehara (1994) showed that this result is optimal.\nThe comments in this section were taken, with almost no changes, from a letter\nwritten by Mohammad Ghomi.\n\n34\n\n\f21. History.\nSyamadas Mukhopadhyaya was born on June 22, 1866 at Haripal in the district\nof Hooghly. After graduating from Hooghly College, he took his M.A. degree\nfrom the Presidency College, Calcutta, and was later awarded the first Doctor\nof Philosophy in Mathematics from the Calcutta University, with a thesis titled,\n\"Parametric Coefficients in the Differential Geometry of Curves in an N-space\",\nwhich earned for its author the Griffith Memorial Prize for 1910.\n\nSyamadas Mukhopadhyaya (1866 - 1937)\nMukhopadhyaya began work as a Professor in the Bangabasi College, and some\nyears later moved to the Bethune College, both in Calcutta. There he lectured\nnot only on Mathematics, but also on Philosophy and English Literature. He was\nlater transferred to the Presidency College as Professor of Mathematics. When the\nCalcutta Mathematical Society was started in 1909, he was a founding member,\nand in 1917 became Vice-President of the Society.\n\n35\n\n\fAll of Mukhopadhyaya's mathematical works had a strong geometric flavor.\nHe wrote many papers on the geometry of curves in the plane, and his proof of\nthe Four Vertex Theorem in the case of strictly positive curvature came at the\nvery beginning of his research career. His work on the geometry of curves in\nn-space, the early parts of which were submitted for his doctoral thesis, continued\nafterwards, and was published in six parts in the Bulletin of the Calcutta Mathematical Society over a period of years.\nAfter his retirement in 1932, Mukhopadhyaya went to Europe to study methods of\neducation, and on returning to India wrote a series of memoirs about this. He was\nelected President of the Calcutta Mathematical Society, and served in this capacity\nuntil his death from heart failure on May 8, 1937.\n\"His death has removed from the world of science a man of outstanding genius;\nbut the intimate circle of his friends, admirers and pupils will remember him not\nonly as an able Professor and a successful researcher with a deep insight into the\nfundamental principals of synthetic geometry but also as a sincere guide,\nphilosopher, and friend, ever ready to help the poor in distress.\"\nMukhopadhyaya's obituary appeared in the Bulletin of the Calcutta Mathematical\nSociety, Vol. 29 (1937), pages 115-120. The comments above were taken from\nthis obituary, and the final sentence was copied verbatim.\n\n36\n\n\fAdolf Kneser was born on March 19, 1862 in Gr\u00fcssow, Germany. He received\nhis Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Berlin in 1884, with a thesis\n\"Irreduktibilit\u00e4t und Monodromiegruppe algebraischer Gleichungen\" written\nunder the direction of Leopold Kronecker and Ernst Kummer, and influenced by\nWeierstrass. Kneser was appointed to the chair of mathematics in Dorpat, and then\nlater to the University of Breslau, where he spent the rest of his career.\n\nAdolf Kneser (1862 \u2013 1930)\nAfter his initial interest in algebraic functions and equations, Kneser turned his\nattention to the geometry of space curves, and in 1912 proved the Four Vertex\nTheorem in the general case of mixed positive and negative curvatures.\n\n37\n\n\fAdolf's son Hellmuth, born in 1898 while the family was still in Dorpat, followed\nin his father's mathematical footsteps, and obtained his doctorate from Gottingen\nin 1921 under the direction of David Hilbert, with a thesis titled, \"Untersuchungen\nzur Quantentheorie\". The next year, in 1922, Hellmuth published a new proof of\nthe Four Vertex Theorem. Hellmuth helped Wilhelm S\u00fcss to found the\nMathematical Research Institute at Oberwolfach in 1944, and provided crucial\nsupport over the years to help maintain this world famous institution.\nHellmuth's son Martin continued in the family business, receiving his Ph.D. from\nthe Humboldt University in Berlin in 1950 under the direction of Erhard Schmidt,\nwith a thesis titled, \"\u00dcber den Rand von Parallelkorpern\". He spent the early\npart of his mathematical career in Munich, and then moved to Gottingen.\nAdolf died on January 24, 1930 in Breslau, Germany (now Wroclaw, Poland).\nHellmuth died on August 23 1973 in Tubingen, Germany.\nMartin died on February 16, 2004.\nThe comments above were taken from the online mathematical biographies\nat the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, www.history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk .\n\n38\n\n\fBj\u00f6rn E. J. Dahlberg was born on November 3, 1949 in Sunne, Sweden. He\nreceived his Ph.D. in mathematics from G\u00f6teborg University in 1971 with a thesis,\n\"Growth properties of subharmonic functions\", and with Tord Ganelius as advisor.\nDahlberg was 21 at the time, the youngest mathematics Ph.D. in Sweden.\n\nBj\u00f6rn E. J. Dahlberg (1949 \u2013 1998)\nDahlberg's mathematical interests were shaped during his postdoctoral fellowship\nyear at the Mittag-Leffler Institute in Stockholm, which Lennart Carleson had\nrecently revitalized. Dahlberg was deeply influenced by Carleson, and participated\nin the programs of harmonic analysis and quasi-conformal mappings at the Institute,\nwhile learning about partial differential equations.\nOne issue of great importance to the mathematical community at that time was to\nextend known results in these areas to domains with complicated boundaries. In\n1977 Dahlberg showed that, for bounded Lipschitz domains, surface measure on\nthe boundary and harmonic measure are mutually absolutely continuous, which\nimplies the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the Laplacian on such domains.\n\n39\n\n\fFor this work, Dahlberg was awarded the Salem Prize (Paris) in harmonic analysis\nin 1978, the Edlund's prize from the Royal Academy of Science in Stockholm in\n1979, and was invited to give a 45 minute address at the International Congress of\nMathematicians in Warsaw, Poland in 1982.\nIn 1980 Dahlberg was appointed to a full professorship at Uppsala University, and\nthree years later to a full professorship at G\u00f6teborg, which remained his home base\nfor the rest of his life. He traveled a lot, and held visiting faculty positions at the\nUniversities of Minnesota, Michigan and Texas, at Purdue University and Washington University in St. Louis, at the Universite Paris-Sud, as well as at ETH (Zurich),\nYale, Cal Tech, Chicago and South Carolina.\nWhile in G\u00f6teborg, Dahlberg started a project with Volvo on computer aided\ngeometric design of the surfaces of a car, leading to new theoretical results and a\nnew design system. In his last years, Dahlberg worked on questions of discrete\ngeometry connected to his work with Volvo and other companies, as well as to his\nolder interest in non-smooth domains.\nDahlberg died suddenly on January 30, 1998 from meningitis, an inflammation of\nthe lining that protects the brain and spinal cord.\nThe comments above were taken mainly from a letter written by Vilhelm Adolfsson,\none of Dahlberg's Ph.D. students who, along with Peter Kumlin, found Dahlberg's\nmanuscript on the Converse to the Four Vertex Theorem after his death, edited it,\nand submitted it for publication. Ville went on to add some personal notes.\n\"Bj\u00f6rn was a very inspiring and charismatic person. Where other mathematicians\ntended to see difficulties, Bj\u00f6rn saw possibilities: nothing was impossible! I\nremember leaving his office after discussing current problems, I always felt\nencouraged and full of enthusiasm. He often cheerfully exclaimed: The sky is the\nlimit! One might then think that he was overly optimistic, but he was well aware\nof the difficulties and the uncertainties. One of his favorite sayings was 'Hindsight\nis the only certain science.' \"\n\n40\n\n\f22.
