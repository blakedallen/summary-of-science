Introduction\nIn this paper, we study the Dirichlet boundary value problem of the classical semilinear parabolic equation\n(1)\n\nut \u2212 \u2206u = |u|p\u22121 u,\n\nin \u03a9 \u00d7 (0, T )\n\nwith u = 0 on the boundary \u2202\u03a9 \u00d7 [0, T ) and u = \u03c6 at t = 0, where T > 0,\n\u03a9 \u2282 Rn is a compact C 1 domain, p > 1 is a fixed constant, and \u03c6 \u2208 C02 (\u03a9)\nn+2\nis a given smooth function. Assume that p \u2264 pS = n\u22122\nfor n \u2265 3 and\np < \u221e for n = 1, 2. By the standard theory we know that there is a local\ntime positive solution to (1). With the help of Nehari functional, one may\nfind the threshold of the initial datum such that the solution either exists\nglobally or blows up in finite time. More interesting results about (1) can be\nfound in the recent work [1]. Since the equation (1) is a model problem, it\ndeserves to have more understanding. Introducing new idea, we show in this\npaper that there are two new sets W\u0303 and Z\u0303 such that for \u03c6 \u2208 W\u0303 , there is a\nglobal positive solution in W\u0303 with the H 1 omega limit 0 and for \u03c6 \u2208 Z\u0303, the\nsolution blows up at finite time. We may extend the method used in this\npaper to treat Neumann boundary value problem of semilinear parabolic\nequation with negative power in [4]. To define the invariant set Z\u0303, we shall\nuse the fact that the cones\nC+ = {u \u2208 C01 (\u03a9); u \u2265 0, u 6= 0}\nThe research is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of\nChina 10631020 and SRFDP 20090002110019.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nLI MA\n\nand\n\nC\u2212 = {u \u2208 C01 (\u03a9); u \u2264 0, u 6= 0}\nare invariant sets of (1). This fact can be proved by applying the maximum\nprinciple.\nWe now recall the standard way to construct the invariant sets for (1).\nFormally, (1) has a Lyapunov functional; namely,\nZ\n1\n1\n|\u2207u|2 \u2212\nup+1 .\nJ(u) =\n2\n1+p\nR\nHere and after, we use to denote the integration over \u03a9. In fact, we may\nconsider (1) as the negative L2-gradient flow of the functional J(*). That is,\nabstractly, (1) can be written as\nut = \u2212J \u2032 (u).\nHence, we have\nd\nJ(u(t)) =< J \u2032 (u), ut >= \u2212|ut |22 = \u2212|J \u2032 (u)|2L2 .\ndt\nLet f (u) = up and its primitive\nF (u) =\n\nup+1\n.\np+1\n\nIntroduce the working space\n\u03a3 = {u \u2208 H01 ; u 6= 0,\n\nZ\n\nF (u) < \u221e}.\n\nR\nThe condition F (u) < \u221e is always true by using the Sobolev inequality.\nDefine on \u03a3, the functional\nZ\n1\n|u|2\nM (u) =\n2 \u03a9\nand the Nehari functional\nZ\nZ\n2\nI(u) = |\u2207u| \u2212 uf (u) = |\u2207u|2 \u2212 |u|p+1 .\nNote that these two functionals are well-defined on \u03a3.\nAlong the flow (1) we can see that\nZ\nd\n(2)\nM (u) = uut = \u2212I(u).\ndt\nLet\nd = inf{J(u); u \u2208 \u03a3; I(u) = 0}.\nDefine\n[\nW = {u \u2208 \u03a3; J(u) < d, I(u) > 0} {0}\nand\n\nZ = {u \u2208 \u03a3; J(u) < d, I(u) < 0}.\nThe classical result says that W and Z are invariant sets of (1); furthermore,\nfor 1 < p < pS and for any initial data \u03c6 \u2208 W , the solution exists globally;\n\n\fCLASSICAL SEMILINEAR PARABOLIC EQUATION\n\n3\n\nfor 1 < p \u2264 pS and for any initial data \u03c6 \u2208 Z, the solution blows up at finite\ntime. One may see [5] for more results and references.\nWe now introduce new functionals. For \u03bb \u2208 R+ , define\nE\u03bb (u) = J(u) + \u03bbM (u).\nThen along the flow (1), we have\nd\nE\u03bb (u) = \u2212|J \u2032 (u)|22 \u2212 \u03bbI(u).\n(3)\ndt\nFrom this, it is clear that for \u03bb \u2265 0, we have\nd\nE\u03bb (u) > 0\ndt\nexcept |J \u2032 (u)| = 0.\nIntroduce\nd\u03bb = inf{E\u03bb (u); u \u2208 \u03a3; I(u) = 0}.\nAs in the case for the quantity d, we can give it the mountain-pass characterization.\nAssume it is finite at this moment. Define\n[\nW\u03bb = {u \u2208 \u03a3; E\u03bb (u) < d\u03bb , I(u) > 0} {0}.\n\nFor convenient we set W0 = W . Arguing as in W , one can see that W\u03bb with\n\u03bb > 0 is non-empty.\nThen by (3) and the standard argument we know that for \u03bb \u2265 0, W\u03bb is a\ninvariant set of the flow (1).\nOne of our main results for (1) is to show the the following conclusion.\nTheorem 1. Fix any power 1 < p < pS , we have for \u03bb > 0 that\n(1). d\u03bb is finite, and d\u03bb > d for \u03bb > 0;\n(2). for \u03c6 \u2208 W\u03bb with \u03bb \u2265 0, the flow exists globally and its omega limit\nis {0}. Hence\n[\nW\u0303 :=\nW\u03bb\n\u03bb\u22650\n\nis invariant set of (1).\nWe remark that since d\u03bb > d, we know that the set W\u03bb is different from\nthe set W .\nTo find the set for blow-up solutions to (1), we need to use the comparison\nargument. We shall restrict the initial data being positive. Let \u03b4 \u2265 0.\nConsider the boundary value problem of the following semilinear parabolic\nequation\n(4)\n\nvt \u2212 \u2206v + \u03b4v = v p , u > 0, in \u03a9 \u00d7 (0, T )\n\nwith u = 0 on the boundary \u2202\u03a9 \u00d7 [0, T ) and u = \u03c6 at t = 0, where T :=\nTmax (\u03c6) T\n> 0 is the maximal existence time of the solution v(t).

We remark\nthat one may make similar construction on \u03a3\u2212 = \u03a3 C\u2212 .\n\nTheorem 2. Fix 1 < p \u2264 pS . (1). For \u03c6 \u2208 Z\u03b4 and \u03c6 \u2265 v\u03b4 , the flow (v(t))\nto (4) blows up in finite time.\n(2). Let u(t) be the flow to (1) with the initial data \u03c6 as (1) above. Then\nu(t) \u2265 v(t) and u(t) blows up at some t < \u221e.\nAs a consequence of Theorem 2, we have\nS\nCorollary 3. Set Z\u0303 = \u03b4\u22650 Z\u03b4 . Then for any \u03c6 \u2208 Z\u0303, the solution for (1)\nblows up at finite time.\nThe results above will be proved in next section.\n2. Global solution and finite time blow-up solution\n\nWe now prove Theorem 1.\n(1). The finiteness of d\u03bb can be obtained in the similar way as in [5].\nSince 1 < p < pS , we know that d\u03bb can also be achieved by some function\nu\u03bb (see [2] [3], or [6]). By this we know that d\u03bb is different from d for \u03bb > 0.\nHence, we have d\u03bb > d for \u03bb > 0.\n(2). Since I(\u03c6) > 0, we have I(u(t)) > 0 for all t \u2208 [0, T ). For otherwise,\nfor some t > 0, I(u(t)) = 0. Using the definition of d\u03bb , we have E\u03bb (u(t)) \u2265\nd\u03bb . This is a contradiction to the fact that\nd\nE\u03bb (u(t)) < 0, and E\u03bb (u(t)) < E\u03bb (\u03c6) < d\u03bb .\ndt\nUsing (2), we know that M (u(t)) < M (\u03c6). With the help of the condition\nE\u03bb (u(t)) < d and 1 < p < pS , we know that u(t) \u2208 H 1 is uniformly bounded\nand bounding constant depends only on d, p, |\u03a9|, and M (\u03c6).\nThe H 1 omega limit at t = \u221e can be determined below. It is a classical\nfact ([5]) that the H 1 omega limit set \u03c9(\u03c6) consists of classical equilibria. If\nv \u2208 \u03c9(\u03c6), we have I(v) = 0. If v is nontrivial, we have\nE\u03bb (v) \u2265 d\u03bb .\nImpossible. Hence v = 0, that is, \u03c9(\u03c6) = {0}.\n\n\fCLASSICAL SEMILINEAR PARABOLIC EQUATION\n\n5\n\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 1.\nThe remaining part of this section we give the proof of Theorem 2.\nProof.

Since I\u03b4 (\u03c6) < \u2212\u01eb, by using the definition of d\u03b4,\u01eb and the\ncontinuity, we know that\nI\u03b4 (v(t)) < \u2212\u01eb.\nNote that\n\nZ\n2\n) |v|p+1 .\nI\u03b4 (v) = 2J\u03b4 (v) \u2212 (1 \u2212\np+1\nAssume that T = Tmax > 0 be the maximal time of the flow (v(t)).

Let Tmax < \u221e be the blow-up time of the flow (v(t)). Recall\nthat v(t) > 0 for t \u2208 (0, Tmax ). Let w(t) = u(t) \u2212 v(t), t < Tmax .

Let w\u2212 (t) be the negative part\nof w(t). Multiplying both sides of (7) by w\u2212 (t) and integrating over \u03a9 by\nw\u2212 (t), we get\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nd\n2\n2\n\u2212p\u22121\n2\n|w\u2212 (t)| = \u2212 |\u2207w\u2212 (t)| + p \u03be\n|w\u2212 (t)| + \u03b4 vw\u2212 (t).\ndt\nWe remark that the last term is non-positive.
