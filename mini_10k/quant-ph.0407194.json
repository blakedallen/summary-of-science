INTRODUCTION\nQuantum information processing (QIP) is a very active area of research in physics,\nchemistry, and computer science. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of several\ntechniques that have been applied to test the principles and algorithms of QIP; it has utilized\nmore qubits and realized more algorithms than other approaches.1-5 For example, the use of a 7qubit NMR system to implement the Shor quantum algorithm for factorization has been\nreported.6\nAt or near room temperature, a nuclear spin system at thermal equilibrium composes of a\nmixture of many quantum states. It has been shown that some quantum algorithms, such as the\nDeutsch-Jozsa algorithm, can be implemented starting with the thermal equilibrium state,7-9 but\nthis situation is far from universal. A more general approach is to use a pseudopure (effective\npure) quantum state of a spin system as the basis for NMR QIP, because a pseudopure state\ntransforms similarly to a pure quantum state in the process of unitary evolution.10,11 A\n\n1\n\n\fpseudopure state is defined as a state whose density matrix differs from that of a pure state by a\nscalar multiple of the unity matrix:10\n\u03c1=\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1 )1 + 2\u03b1 | \u03c8 >< \u03c8 |\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) \u22c5 2 N + 2\u03b1\n\n(\u22121 < \u03b1 < 1) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere |\u03c8> is a unit spinor, and N is the number of qubits. In other words, a pseudopure state is a\nstate for which all but one of the energy levels in the spin system are equally populated.\nThere are several methods for preparing pseudopure states, including spatial averaging,10\nlogical labeling,11,12 temporal averaging,13 and selective saturation.14,15 For multi-qubit spin\nsystems, the procedures usually involve very elaborate pulse sequences. For example, 9\nexperiments were combined to prepare one of the 32 pseudopure states in a 5-qubit system,16 and\n48 pulses were used to prepare one of the 128 pseudopure states in a 7-qubit system.17 To\ncircumvent the difficulty in preparing individual pseudopure spin states, we have proposed the\nuse of pairs of pseudopure states (POPS) as the basis of QIP because of the experimental\nsimplicity.18,19 Each POPS involves two pseudopure states i and k, one positive and one\nnegative, and the population on the jth level is expressed by\nNj(i\u2212k) = N\u00b0 + N\u03b5 \u22c5 (\u03b4ij \u2212 \u03b4kj),\n(2)\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\nwhere N\u00b0 and N are constants (N\u00b0 >> N ), and \u03b4ij is the Kronecker symbol. Applications of\nPOPS to implement a quantum logic gate19 and the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm9 have been\ndemonstrated.\nIn this report, we show a simple method to manipulate the spectra corresponding to two\nproperly chosen POPS to obtain a spectrum that is representative of a single pseudopure state. In\nthis process, the auxiliary (and unwanted) pseudopure states are eliminated, and an equivalence\nof the pseudopure state of interest is produced.\nII. EXPERIMENT\nThe compound 2,4,5-trifluorobenzonitrile was purchased from Aldrich Chemicals and\nused without further purification. It was dissolved in a liquid crystal mixture, which contained\nequal amounts of S1409, ZLI1495, and ZLI1496 (all purchased from EM Chemicals), to make a\n5% solution.19\nThe 19F and 1H NMR experiments were carried out at 376.3 and 400.0 MHz, respectively,\nat 21 oC, using a Varian UNITY/INOVA 400 NMR spectrometer. Every spectrum was acquired\nusing 64 scans and processed without line broadening. All the selective \u03c0 pulses were Gaussian,\nlasting 100 ms each.\n2\n\n\fIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe normal 1H and 19F NMR spectra of 2,4,5-trifluorobenzonitrile in the liquid crystalline\nsolution studied are first order and well resolved, consisting of 32 and 48 peaks, respectively. It\nis a good example of a 5-qubit system, for which each spin gives rise to 16 resolved peaks. The\nspectra of the thermal equilibrium state are shown in Fig. 1(a); corresponding spectra displaying\nthe resolved peaks in expanded scales and analyses of the spectra can be found in ref. 19. For this\n5-qubit system, the 32 pseudopure states and the corresponding expected spectral patterns are\nlisted in Table I. When the signs of the peaks are taken into account, the sub-spectrum of any one\nspin can be used to identify all the pseudopure states and any of their linear combinations\nprovided that there is 100% spectral fidelity. This principle is, of course, applicable to spin 1\u20442\nsystems with any number of qubits.\nTo use POPS as the basis to carry out a given set of unitary operations, two experiments\nstarting from the thermal equilibrium state are combined:\nI. Selective \u03c0 pulse \u2013 unitary operations \u2013 non-selective small-angle pulse \u2013 FID(I);\nII. Delay without pulse \u2013 unitary operations \u2013 non-selective small-angle pulse \u2013 FID(II);\nwhere FID refers to the free induction decay of the NMR signal, and the width of the detection\n(non-selective small-angle) pulse is set to about \u03c0/10 to meet the condition of linear response. In\nthe second experiment, the duration of the first delay is set to be the same as the length of the\ntransition-selective \u03c0 pulse in the first experiment. When the FID from the first experiment is\nsubtracted from that of the second, the result is the same as that obtained from a state at which\nthe populations of all but two of the energy levels are equal. Thus, the algebraic sum of two\npseudopure states, one positive and one negative, is created before the unitary operations are\napplied, and the output spectrum is obtained form the Fourier transform of [FID(II) \u2013 FID(I)]. In\npractice, the two experiments are combined into one by setting up the two pulse sequences in\nsuccessive scans, and phase-shifting the receiver by 180\u00b0 for the first sequence; the unwanted\ntransverse components are removed by either using phase cycling or applying a field gradient. In\na similar vein, the application of a hard \u03c0/2 pulse on one subsystem (e. g. 1H) followed by a\nselective \u03c0 pulse on another subsystem (e. g. 19F) has also been suggested;20 the resulting\nspectrum of the first subsystem is the same as that obtained by using the POPS method, but the\nspectrum of the second subsystem contains far more peaks.\nFor spin 1\u20442 systems with N qubits, there are 2N\u20131\u22c5(2N \u20131) possible POPS, but only N\u22c52N\u22121\nPOPS can be created experimentally. The spectra of one sub-set of POPS (16 out of 80) of the 5qubit system studied are shown in ref. 19. As a further development, a method using the POPS\n\n3\n\n\ftechnique to obtain spectra having the correct frequencies and signs of single pseudopure states\nis presented in the following.\nUsing the definition given in Eq. 1 and labeling the density matrix of the ith pseudopure\nstate by a superscript i, the density matrix of a POPS can be denoted by \u03c1i \u2212 \u03c1j. If the density\nmatrices of two POPS containing a common pseudopure state are multiplied with each other, the\nresult is\n(\u03c1i \u2212 \u03c1j )\u22c5(\u03c1i \u2212 \u03c1k ) = (\u03c1i)2\n(3)\nbecause the basis spin functions \u03c8i are orthogonal. Here we would not go into the details of the\nrelation between the density matrices of pseudopure states and the corresponding spectra, but\nwould only consider a result pertinent to this study: the peak frequencies in the product of the\nspectra for two sets of POPS sharing a common pseudopure state, as expressed by Eq. (3), are\nexactly the same as those in the spectrum representing this common (single) pseudopure state. In\nother words, the peaks in the spectra corresponding to (\u03c1i)2 and \u03c1i have the same frequencies (but\nnot necessarily the same intensity ratios). As an example, the 1H and 19F spectra for two\nappropriate POPS are shown in Fig. 1(b) and 1(c), respectively. The POPS [(vi) \u2013 (xiv)] was\ncreated by applying a selective \u03c0 pulse at the 1H transition B8 in step I, and the POPS [(vi) \u2013\n(xxii)] was created by applying a selective \u03c0 pulse at A8. The product of the spectra for these\ntwo POPS is displayed in Fig. 1d. A careful examination of the spectral positions shows that the\npeak frequencies are exactly the same as those expected for the common pseudopure state (vi), as\nlisted in Table I, but all peaks are positive.\nTo obtain peaks with correct signs matching those in the spectrum for the pseudopure state\ni\n\u03c1 , spectral multiplication corresponding to the matrix product\n|\u03c1i \u2212 \u03c1j|\u22c5(\u03c1i \u2212 \u03c1k) = |\u03c1i |\u22c5\u03c1i\n(4a)\ni\nj\ni\nk\ni\ni\nor\n(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1 )\u22c5| \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1 | = \u03c1 \u22c5|\u03c1 |\n(4b)\ncan be used. The spectrum obtained by such a manipulation is shown in Fig. 1e; the frequencies\nand signs of the peaks now exactly match those of the pseudopure state (vi), the expected values\nof which are shown in Table I. To reiterate the results, Figs. 1b displays the spectra for one\nPOPS, [(vi) \u2013 (xiv)], and Fig. 1c displays the spectra for another POPS, [(vi) \u2013 (xxii)]. The\nproduct of |spectrum (1b)| and spectrum (1c) is displayed in Fig. 1e, and it shows that the peaks\nfor the auxiliary pseudopure states (xiv) and (xxii) are eliminated, yielding a spectrum\ncharacteristic of a single pseudopure state (vi). For a 5-qubit system, this is by far the simplest\nmethod to achieve such a result, and the operation represented by Eq. 4 cannot be accomplished\nby linear operations such as addition or subtraction.\nThe method of spectral multiplication21,22 leads to an apparent enhancement in the signalto-noise ratio, S/N (Table II), but this does not truly increase the sensitivity by picking up signals\nhidden within the noise. It is rarely used in normal NMR spectroscopy because the intensities of\n4\n\n\fthe peaks are distorted. However, this may not be a problem for QIP because the reading of\nbinary codes depends on only the presence or absence of a peak at a given frequency and the sign\nof the peak; the relative amplitudes are often of secondary concern except for some special\nstudies such as tomography.\nThe preparation and reading of pseudopure states are, of course, important not only for\nthe input stage, but also for the output stage after a series of unitary operations is carried out.\nSince multiplication is in general not a linear operation, the procedure cannot be applied in the\nbeginning or middle of an algorithm, which would generally transform a pseudopure state into\nthe linear combination of a number of pseudopure states:\n(\u03c1i )input \u21d2 (\u03a3 ct \u03c1t )output .\n(5)\nHowever, if the algorithm has a one-to-one correspondence, yielding only one pseudopure state\nin the output stage:\n(\u03c1I )input \u21d2 (\u03c1t )output ,\n(6)\nthe input of a POPS would give another POPS as the output:\n(\u03c1i \u2212 \u03c1j )input \u21d2 (\u03c1t \u2212 \u03c1u )output\n(7a)\ni\nk\nt\nv\nand\n(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1 )input \u21d2 (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1 )output .\n(7b)\nIn Eq. 7, it is assumed that i \u2260 j \u2260 k, t \u2260 u \u2260 v, and i \u2260 t, but does not exclude j = u and k = v. In\nthe case of one-to-one correspondence, two output POPS spectra obtained from applying the\nsame sequence in two different experiments can be multiplied to remove contributions from the\nauxiliary pseudopure states, as expressed by a matrix formula similar to Eq. 4:\n|\u03c1t \u2212 \u03c1u |\u22c5(\u03c1t \u2212 \u03c1v ) = |\u03c1t |\u22c5\u03c1t .\n(8)\nThen, the product spectrum shows all the characteristics of the spectrum of the expected (correct)\noutput of a single pseudopure state. To verify this argument, experiments for implementing two\ndifferent logic gates operating on the two same sets of POPS have been performed.\nControl-NOT (C-NOT) gates are a basic category of logic gates for binary information\nprocessing. A CN\u20131-NOT gate is defined as an operation which flips one qubit conditional upon\nthe state of the other N \u2013 1 qubits.1 It can be implemented by applying a selective \u03c0 pulse at the\nproper transition frequency.24 The C4-NOT gate used in our example is defined as such that the\nfirst four control qubits have the values 0010 and the last qubit is flipped in the operation (in a\nmore restrictive definition, the control qubits all have the value 1). This C4-NOT gate was\napplied to the POPS [(vi) \u2013 (xiv)] and [(vi) \u2013 (xxii)] by employing a selective \u03c0 pulse at the 19F\ntransition E13. The corresponding output POPS are [(v) \u2013 (xiv)] and [(v) \u2013 (xxii)], and the\ncorresponding spectra are shown in Fig. 2(a) and 2(b), respectively. By comparing the two sets\nof POPS spectra in Figs. 1 and 2 and the data in Table II, it can be seen that the C4-NOT\noperation causes the S/N to decrease. Fig. 2(c) shows the product of |spectrum (2a)| and spectrum\n(2b), yielding a spectrum representing |(v)|\u22c5(v). The peaks in this spectrum have the same\n5\n\n\ffrequencies and signs as those for the single pseudopure state (v), which would be the output of\napplying the same C4-NOT gate to the pseudopure state (vi). For comparison, the product of two\nother POPS without applying any gate, |(v) \u2013 (xiii)|\u22c5[(v) \u2013 (xxi)], also yields |(v)|\u22c5(v), and the\ncorresponding 19F spectrum is shown in Fig. 2(d). The spectral pattern is, of course, the same as\nthat in Fig. 2(c), but the distortion in spectral amplitudes is less. Because it is sufficient to study\nthe spectra of either the 1H or the 19F nucleus of the 5-qubit system to obtain all information\nneeded for QIP, the 1H spectra are not examined.\nSWAP gates exchange the values of two qubits. A CN\u20132-SWAP gate is defined as an\noperation which swaps two qubits conditional upon the values of the other N \u2013 2 qubits.1 It can\nbe implemented by applying three consecutive selective \u03c0 pulse at two proper transition\nfrequencies (\u03c0r\u2212\u03c0s\u2212\u03c0r). The subscripts refer to the peaks being irradiated; r connects the initial\nstate with an intermediate state, and s connects the intermediate state with the final state. The C3SWAP gate we studied was chosen so that the first three control qubits have the values 001, and\nthe last two qubits are swapped in the operation (again, in a more restrictive definition, the\ncontrol qubits all have the value 1). The spectra in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b) show the results of applying\nthis C3-SWAP gate on the POPS [(vi) \u2013 (xiv)] and [(vi) \u2013 (xxii)], respectively, to obtain the\ncorresponding POPS [(vii) \u2013 (xiv)] and [(vii) \u2013 (xxii)], by using the same pulse sequence\n(\u03c0D11\u2212\u03c0E9\u2212\u03c0D11). The spectrum shown in Fig. 3(c) is the product of |spectrum (3a)| and spectrum\n(3b), yielding a spectrum for |(vii)|\u22c5(vii), which has the same spectral pattern as the single\npseudopure state (vii). Fig. 3(d) shows the spectrum for the product POPS |(vii) \u2013 (xv)|\u22c5[(vii) \u2013\n(xxiii)] = |(vii)|\u22c5(vii) without applying any gate. Just like the previous case, the frequencies and\nspectral pattern are identical to those shown in Fig. 3(c), but the distortion in spectral amplitudes\nis less.\nIt is to be noted that the C3-SWAP gate is three times as long as the C4-NOT gate, and the\ndecrease in S/N is much larger for the output POPS as well as their products (Table II). This is\nmainly due to the effect of relaxation (quantum decoherence), which causes the S/N of individual\nspectrum to decrease rapidly as the duration of the logic gate is lengthened. For different\ntransitions in the 19F spectrum of the sample studied, T1 ranges from 0.483\u00b10.005 s to\n0.854\u00b10.010 s; T2 could not be determined because the system is strongly coupled; T2*, as\ndetermined from the linewidths, ranges from 0.086 s to 0.145 s. However, it is difficult to relate\nthe differences in S/N to the relaxation times quantitatively.\nIn summary, we have shown that the method of spectral multiplication, which\ncorresponds to the operations expressed in Eqs. (4) and (7), produces a spectrum that has the\nsame peak frequencies and signs as that of a single pseduopure state. In other words, because the\nspectrum corresponding to the product |\u03c1i|\u22c5\u03c1i (or |\u03c1t |\u22c5\u03c1t) has the same characteristics as those for\n\u03c1i (or |\u03c1t |\u22c5\u03c1t), the method is equivalent to the preparation of a pseudopure state in either the input\n6\n\n\for the output stage by eliminating the unwanted pseudopure states in the POPS approach. Its\nadvantage is the simplicity of the experimental method compared to other existing techniques; its\nlimitation is that there must be a one-to-one correspondence for the method to be successful. A\nsecondary result of spectral multiplication is to increase the S/N of the spectrum. However, this\nis a superficial improvement that neither increases the sensitivity nor corrects quantum error. An\nunderstanding of the origin of various sources of quantum error and devising methods of error\ncorrection are important tasks in QIP,25 but they are beyond the scope of the present work.\nReferences\n1.
