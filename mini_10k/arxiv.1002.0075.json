The proposed mechanism offers a time oscillating decay with the frequency up to 0.1\nHz. The experiment to observe the modulation is proposed for ions stored in a Penning trap. An\nattempt to understand the GSI anomaly with multiple photon transitions is made.\nPACS numbers: 23.40.-s, 32.30.Dx, 32.80.Rm\n\nLongstanding attempts have been made to change artificially the decay of radioactive nuclei using different\nexternal factors. It was suggested by Segr\u00e9 [1] that the\norbital electron capture (EC) decay rates depend on the\ndensity of atomic electrons within a nucleus. Thus, environmental conditions may alter electron densities and\naffect EC decay rates. However this effect is small and\ndoes not exceed the fractions of percentage point.\nThe introduction of Penning traps and storage rings\ninto nuclear physics has allowed to study radioactive\nhydrogen-like (H-like) ions. Recently the single ion spectroscopy technique with time resolution less than 1 s has\nbeen developed at GSI Darmstadt. With this elegant\nmethod, the oscillatory modulation of the exponential\nEC decay for the 140 Pr58+ and 142 Pm60+ ions was found\nin [2]. The modulation period of 7.1 s is incommensurable\nwith all the energy intervals involved in the experiment\nwith exclusion of the neutrino mass difference. Perhaps\nthis is the main motivation of the Letter [3] which relates\nthe anomaly to neutrino mixing.\nOur motivation for this work is to show that there\nis a mechanism related to Rabi oscillations which offers\nsuch a small period. To observe the time modulation of\nthe EC decay, we propose to apply Penning trap mass\nspectrometry with ions in the intermediate mass region\nhaving the \"sterile\" relative to the EC decay hyperfine\nstate. We analyze also the effect of the magnetic fields\nof dipole and quadrupole magnets in the Experimental\nStorage Ring (ESR) on the GSI oscillations.\nThe 1s1/2 state of a H-like ion has two hyperfine levels\nwith the total angular momentum F = I \u00b1 1/2, where\nI is the nuclear spin. In the case of a positive nuclear\nmagnetic moment \u03bc, the ground state of an ion has F =\nI \u2212 1/2, whereas for negative \u03bc, the order of these energy\nlevels is reversed. When I = 1, the hyperfine splitting of\nthe 1s1/2 state is given by [4]\n\u2206E =\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\n2\u03b1(\u03b1Z)3 (\u03bc/\u03bcN )m2 c\np\np\n,\nM (2 1 \u2212 (\u03b1Z)2 \u2212 1) 1 \u2212 (\u03b1Z)2\n\naddress: pavi@mbslab.kiae.ru\n\n(1)\n\nwhere m, M , \u03bcN , and \u03b1 are the masses of electron and\nproton, nuclear magneton, and the fine-structure constant, respectively. For nuclei with I \u03c0 = 1+ , the EC\ndecay from the F = 3/2 state is forbidden because fully\nionized daughter nuclei have I \u03c0 = 0+ . This feature of\nsuch ions may be used for observing the time modulation of the EC decay.\nThe oscillatory behavior of the EC decay of such ions\ncan be obtained with the Rabi resonance method used in\nnuclear magnetic spectroscopy. We consider an ion in a\nstatic magnetic field in the z direction, resulting in the\nZeeman splitting of both hyperfine levels. Transitions\nbetween the Zeeman components of these two states are\ndriven by the transverse oscillating field along the x direction with frequency \u03c9. When the frequency \u03c9 is tuned\nto \u2206E/h\u0304, the oscillation of populations for the states\nF = 1/2, M and F = 3/2, \u2212M , where M = 1/2 or \u22121/2,\nis modulated with the Rabi frequency, which is proportional to the amplitude of the driving field. Because the\nEC decay probability is proportional to the occupation\nof the F = 1/2 state, the Rabi frequency may be observed as the time modulation of the EC decay rates.\nThe time modulation of EC-decay is also possible with\nthe resonance transitions involving several field quanta.\nPenning trap.- A single H-like ion in a Penning trap\nis an ideal object for observing the modulation of the\nEC decay. The ion having a charge-to-mass ratio q/M is\nconfined in a strong magnetic field B(0, 0, B0 ) superimposed with a weak electrostatic quadrupole field [5]. The\nsolution of the motion equations yields the cyclotron, axial and magnetron harmonic oscillations. The ion mass\nis determined via the determination of the free-space cyclotron frequency \u03c9c = qBz /M c which derived from three\nmeasured harmonic frequencies. The single ion spectroscopy developed in the ESR experiments can be installed at a Penning trap [6]. In this technique, it is possible to realize the fully controllable experiment on the\ntime modulation of the EC decay by single- and multiphoton resonance.\nWe are interested in the time evolution of the two hyperfine states of an ion exposed by the trap magnetic\nfield B and irradiated by the in-plane elliptically polarized driving field b(bx sin \u03c9t, 0, bz cos \u03c9t). The strength\n\n\f2\nof the latter is restricted by the frequency resolution of\nthe single ion spectroscopy. It is necessary for a shift in\nthe cyclotron frequency \u03c9c caused by the influence of the\nfield b to be small compared to the change in \u03c9c due to\nthe transition from a parent ion to a daughter nucleus.\nAs a rough approximation, this gives b < B0 QEC /(M c2 ),\nwhere QEC is the decay energy.\nThe total Hamiltonian is H = H0 + U (t) + V (t),\nwhere H0 = HD + (e/2)[\u03b1r]*B describes the 1s1/2 state\nof a H-like ion in the Penning trap. Here HD is the\nDirac Hamiltonian with hyperfine interaction and \u03b1 is\nthe Dirac matrix. The eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of\nH0 are |+i = |3/2, M+ i, E3/2 + (1/3)g\u03bcB B0 M+ = h\u0304\u03c93\nand |\u2212i = |1/2, M i, E1/2 \u2212(1/3)g\u03bcB B0 M = h\u0304\u03c91 . Here\n\u03bcB is the Bohr magneton and g is the gyromagnetic ratio of the bound electron in a H-like ion. The terms\nU (t) = (e/2)[\u03b1r]z bz cos \u03c9t and V (t) = (e/2)[\u03b1r]x bx sin \u03c9t\nrepresent the diagonal and off-diagonal parts of the interaction between an ion and the driving field.\nThere are three independent transitions between the\nlower and upper Zeeman sub-states which can be used\nfor the modulation of the EC decay:\n(i) The transitions between the states |3/2, +1/2i and\n|1/2, \u22121/2i or |3/2, \u22121/2i and |1/2, +1/2i with the energy \u2206E = E3/2 \u2212E1/2 = h\u0304\u03c90 regardless of the sign of \u03bc.\n(ii) The transitions between the states |3/2, \u22133/2i and\n|1/2, \u22131/2i for \u03bc > 0 (upper sign) and \u03bc < 0 (lower\nsign) with the energy \u2206E \u2212 (2/3)g\u03bcB B0 .\n(iii) The transitions between the states |3/2, \u00b13/2i and\n|1/2, \u00b11/2i for \u03bc > 0 (upper sign) and \u03bc < 0 (lower sign)\nwith the energy \u2206E + (2/3)g\u03bcB B0 .\nThus, we have the two discrete states |+i and |\u2212i with\nthe energies \u01eb3 = h\u0304\u03c93 and \u01eb1 = h\u0304(\u03c91 \u2212 i\u03bb/2), where \u03bb is\nthe EC decay constant. Let the amplitudes for an ion to\nbe in these states are a+ (t) and a\u2212 (t). Then the system\nevolves according to the equations\nih\u0304\u0227\u2212 = (\u01eb1 + U\u2212 cos \u03c9t)a\u2212 + V\u2212+ a+ sin \u03c9t,\nih\u0304\u0227+ = (\u01eb3 + U+ cos \u03c9t)a+ + V+\u2212 a\u2212 sin \u03c9t,\nwhere U+== g\u03bcB bz M+ /3, U\u2212== \u2212g\u03bcB bz M\u2212 /3,\n(\n1\nfor (i),\nh\u0304V = 3\u221a\n2 g\u03bcB bx\nV+\u2212=\nM\n+\nh\u0304\u1e7c = \u2212 \u221a3|M+ | g\u03bcB bx for (ii) and (iii).\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nTo eliminate the diagonal oscillating terms in (2), we\nperform the transformation\na\u00b1 = A\u00b1 exp [\u2212i(\u03c91 + \u03c93 )t/2 \u2212 i(U\u00b1 /h\u0304\u03c9) sin \u03c9t],\n\n(4)\n\nwhich reduces the equations for the transitions (i) to the\nform\ni\u0226\u2212 = \u2212 21 (\u03c90 + i\u03bb)A\u2212 + V A+ sin \u03c9t,\ni\u0226+ = 21 \u03c90 A+ + V A\u2212 sin \u03c9t,\n\n(5)\n\nThe two other transitions are described by the equations\n\u0001\ni\u0226\u2212 = \u2212 21 (\u03c9\u03030 +i\u03bb)A\u2212 + \u1e7c A+ exp i U\n\u03c9 sin \u03c9t sin \u03c9t,\n\u0001\n(6)\ni\u0226+ = 12 \u03c9\u03030 A+ + \u1e7c A\u2212 exp \u2212i U\u03c9 sin \u03c9t sin \u03c9t,\n\nwhere \u03c9\u03030 = \u03c93 \u2212 \u03c91 , U = (U\u2212 \u2212 U+ )/h\u0304. Through the use\nof the expansion of an exponent in the Bessel functions,\nthese equations are converted to\ni\u0226\u2212 = \u2212 12 (\u03c9\u03030 +i\u03bb)A\u2212 \u2212 i\u1e7c A+\n\n\u221e\nP\n\n\u2032\nJm\n\nm=\u2212\u221e\n\ni\u0226+ = 12 \u03c9\u03030 A+ + i\u1e7c A\u2212\n\n\u221e\nP\n\n\u2032\nJm\n\nm=\u2212\u221e\n\nU\n\u03c9\n\n\u0001\n\nU\n\u03c9\n\n\u0001\n\neim\u03c9t ,\n\ne\u2212im\u03c9t ,\n\n(7)\n\n\u2032\nwhere Jm\nis the derivative of the Bessel function. The\nequations (5) and (7) describe an ion with a positive nuclear magnetic moment \u03bc. When \u03bc < 0, it is necessary\nto change the sign of \u03c90 and \u03c9\u03030 . Up to this point all of\nthe equations are exact.\nThe equations (5) for \u03bb = 0 are the basic ones in the\ntheory of the resonance interaction of the two level system with a periodic field. When \u03c9 \u2248 \u03c90 , we get the usual\nRabi formula for amplitudes replacing the sine by one exponent [7]. For the K-photon resonance when \u03c90 \u2248 K\u03c9,\nShirley [8] found the approximate solution for a weak\ndriving field.

The probability depends on\nthe lower state angular momentum F = F\u00b1 . Expression\n(13) describes damped oscillations with the frequency \u03a9\ndecaying on the scale of half the EC decay constant \u03bb.\nNevertheless, the total number of decays for infinite time\ncalculated with (13) is equal to the number of radioactive\nions at t = 0.\nTo elucidate the time modulation of EC decay, we utilize the concept of the dressed atom introduced by Shirley\n[8] as the quantum limit of the semiclassical theory. The\nion with \u03bc > 0 coasted in a trap and exposed to a resonance field is described by the quantum wave function\n\u03a8(t) = a+ (t)|+i|N \u2212Ki + a\u2212 (t)|\u2212i|N i,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere |N i and |N \u2212Ki are the wave functions with the\nfixed number of photons having the energy h\u0304\u03c9. Thus,\nthe dressed ion has the two hyperfine states entangled\nwith photons. The EC decay at the time t disentangles\nthe state (14) by projecting \u03a8(t) on the state |\u2212i with\nthe probability PF\u2212 (t) (13), to which the decay rate is\nproportional.\nTo observe the time modulation, the H-like radioactive\nion has to have the following properties:\n(1) Its half-life T1/2 should be longer than its preparation\nand cooling time.\n(2) It should have a large fraction of the EC decay, implying large Z.\n(3) The life time \u03c4 of the upper hyperfine state should\nbe longer than T1/2 , implying small Z.\n(4) The frequency \u03a9 of the time modulation of the EC\ndecay should be greater than the EC decay constant \u03bb.\nTable I shows H-like ions which may be considered as\ncandidates for the experimental observation of time modulation. The hyperfine splitting \u2206E is calculated by Eq.\n(1).

It should be emphasized, however, that this problem is a more complicated one owing to the extremely\ncomplex configuration of the ring magnetic field designed\nto store ions. Moreover, the available experimental information is yet incomplete.\nThe ESR lattice has periodic structure with the spatial\nperiod L = C/2, where C = 108.36 m is the circumference of the ring. Thus, an ion circulating in the ESR is\nexposed to the periodic magnetic fields of bending dipole\nand quadrupole magnets. We consider the two fields,\nwhich are in the direction of the x-axis tangent to the\nmain orbit and the z-axis perpendicular to its plane. In\nthe reference frame of a moving ion they can be expressed\nby the Fourier series\nbx (t) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nbxn sin (2\u03c0n\u03b3vt/L) ,\n\nn=1\n\nBz (t) = Bz0 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=1\n\nbzn cos (2\u03c0n\u03b3vt/L) ,\n\n(16)\n\n\f4\nwhere t is the proper time. For the ions in consideration\nthe Lorentz factor is \u03b3 = 1.43. The frequency \u03c9n of n-th\nharmonic is equal to n\u03c9, where \u03c9/2\u03c0 = \u03b3v/L = 5.65\nMHz is the frequency of the first harmonic and the interval between nearby harmonics. The latter is much greater\nthat the width of the multiphoton resonance at the frequency \u03c9n . Therefore, the resonances with different n do\nnot overlap, and may be considered as independent.\nAt first we consider the transition, induced by the fields\nof n-th harmonic, between the hyperfine states F = 1/2\nand F = 3/2 with the energy \u2206E \u223c 1 eV. In principle,\nthe resonance transitions with the Rabi frequency of 0.1\nHz is possible for very high n and small K. However,\nthis is a fallacious result, because the mean life time of\nthe upper F = 3/2 state, \u03c4 = 0, 03 s, is much shorter\nthan the modulation period. Hence, the \"sterile\" state\ncan not be the source of observed oscillations.\nLet us next consider the transitions between the Zeeman components of the lower hyperfine state. For the\nmodulation to be possible, the weak interaction operator\nof the EC decay has to have the different matrix elements for the states with different M . We assume that\nthis is the case. Then the two quasi-stationary states\nexposed to the fields of n-th harmonic evolve according\nto (2), where a+ and a\u2212 are the amplitudes of the lower\n|1/2, +1/2i and upper |1/2, \u22121/2i states with energies\n\u01eb1 = h\u0304(\u03c9+ \u2212 i\u03bb/2) and \u01eb3 = h\u0304(\u03c9\u2212 \u2212 i\u03bb/2), respectively.\nSuppose the ion 140 Pr58+ (or 142 Pm60+ ) circulating in\nthe ESR moves along the main orbit. Then it is exposed to the periodic magnetic field of dipole magnets\nonly. One period L contains three identical dipoles arranged symmetrically around the center of the central\ndipole magnet. The dipole magnet of length d = 6.5 m\ninvolves the strong bending field B(0, 0, B0 ), B0 = 1, 197\nT, and the fringe field b(bx , by , bz ). The latter is calculated by the code OPERA [14]. It is localized in the\nsmall region \u2206x = 29 cm on the two sides of each dipole.\nThe component bz decreases monotonically from B0 to\nzero. The component bx has a pulse shaped form with\nthe maximal value b0 = 36 mT, and the component by is\ntoo small to be taken into account. The Fourier coefficients in (16) are easily found for these components and\nthe matrix elements in (2) are U+ = U\u2212 = pfn /n, V+\u2212 =\nV\u2212+ = \u2212qgn /n, where\np=\n\ng\u03bcB \u03b3B0\ng\u03bcB b0\ng\u03bcB \u03b3B0 d\n, q=\n, and \u031f =\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nh\u0304L0\n\n(17)\n\nis the Zeeman splitting \u031f = \u03c9\u2212 \u2212 \u03c9+ . The periodic\nin n functions fn \u223c gn <\n\u223c 1 depend on the lattice parameters. The splitting \u031f/2\u03c0 = 5.65 GHz is well above\nthe frequency of the first harmonic. This means that\nthe harmonics with high n are involved in the resonance\ntransitions. Hence, the driving field is weak and we can\nuse the approximate solution of (7). In Table III we show\nthe half width and detuning for the K-photon resonance\ncalculated according to the formulas\n\u0012\n\u0013\nqgn \u2032\n2pfn\n\u0393K =\nJ\n, \u2206 = \u031f \u2212 K\u03c9n ,\n(18)\n\u03c0h\u0304n K nh\u0304\u03c9n\n\nfor the harmonics, which are closest to the resonance.\nTABLE III: Half width and detuning for the harmonics close\nto the K-photon resonance for the ion 140 Pr58+ or 142 Pm60+\nmoving along the main orbit.

In a storage ring,\nperiodic motion of an ion in the axial direction (rotation)\nis coupled with its periodic motion in the transverse direction (betatron oscillations). The latter leads to an ion\nbeing exposed to the magnetic field of quadrupole lenses\nwhich change \u0393K and \u2206. However, for the resonance\ncondition \u2206 \u223c \u0393K to be realized an ion has to move\nalong a particular, \"resonance\" orbit. The decays of ions\nstored on non-resonance orbits generate the background\nwith the conventional exponential law.\nThe plausible explanation of the observed oscillation\namplitude is related to the coupling of the F = 1/2 and\nF = 3/2 states. The Hamiltonian corresponding to Eqs.\n(7) offers the coupling due to virtual transitions in the\nstates F=1/2 and 3/2 with different M and nonzero photon numbers. The transitions change the energy (like\nthe Lamb shift) and the wave functions of the states\n|1/2, \u00b11/2i. However, these changes are small due to\nthe weak driving field of the n-th harmonic and cannot\nexplain the observed amplitude.\nIt is not inconceivable also that the coupling of these\nstates is effected by the static or periodic potential W\nassociated with the ESR fields. The solution of the\nSchr\u00f6diger equation for the two hyperfine states gives\n1/2,\u00b11/2\nin the limit W3/2,M /\u2206E \u226a 1 (the matrix elements W\nis assumed to be real) the new eigenfunctions\n1 1\n\" #\n!\"\n#\n2,2\n2(W*W\n)\n1 1\n1\n1\n|1i\ncos \u03b82 sin \u03b82\n|2, 2i\n2 ,\u2212 2\n=\n, tan \u03b8 =\n.\n\u03b8\n1\n1\n\u03b8\nh\u031f\u0304\u2206E\n|2i\n|2, \u22122i\n\u2212 sin 2 cos 2\n(19)\nWith this basis, we find, following the method of [11],\nthe quasienergy function\n\u0001 i\n\u03a8(t) = b1 |1i + b2 |2ie\u2212iK\u03c9n t e\u2212 2 (\u03c9\u2212 +\u03c9+ \u2212i\u03bb)t ,\n(20)\n\nsatisfying the initial condition \u03a8(0) = |1i.

Comparing the latter with observed amplitude 0.2, we find W \u223c 0, 001 eV. The electric quadrupole field required to achieve this value is of\nthe order of atomic fields and cannot exist in the ESR.\nThe required magnetic field B(0, By , Bz ) should be of the\norder of 20 T, which is greater by a factor 20 than the\nESR fields.\nConclusion.-The effect of atomic electron on the EC\ndecay of H-like ions is very important. We have shown\nfor the first time that the EC-decay rates of such ions can\nbe modulated by using the Rabi resonance method with\nsingle or multiphoton transitions. For a long time the\nmultiphoton resonance has been subject of intense experimental and theoretical studies in different fields except\nnuclear physics. We have proposed the experiment with\nintermediate mass ions stored in a Penning trap which\ncan demonstrate this phenomenon.\n\n[1] E. Segr\u00e9, Phys. Rev. 71, 274 (1947).\n[2] Y.

The mechanism includes\nthe coupling of F = 1/2 and F = 3/2 hyperfine states to\nexplain the oscillation amplitude. The important point of\nthis scenario is that the predicted EC decay constant does\nnot violate experimentally and theoretically established\nratio \u03bbH\u2212like\n/\u03bbHe\u2212like\n\u2248 3/2 [15]. We find that the peEC\nEC\nriodic magnetic field of the ESR can generate the oscillations with the frequency of about 0.1 Hz in the transitions\ninvolving several photons. However, the field required to\nexplain the observed amplitude should be many times\nhigher than that of the ESR. Moreover, to tune to the\nresonance a stored ion should move along specific, \"resonance\" orbits. This cast some doubts upon the involvement of the hyperfine structure in the observed oscillations. Therefore, it is necessary to perform the single-ion\nexperiment with the ions 123,5 Cs54+ having the ground\nstate 1s1/2 F = 0 or with the He-like ions without a hyperfine structure. From these experiments definite conclusions may be drawn regarding competing hypotheses\nfor the GSI oscillations.\nAcknowledgments.- The author is grateful to A.\nDolinski for helpful information concerning storage ring\nphysics, and to A.
