This class includes, for instance, the\nwell known Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model [3, 4] and Derrida's p-spin\nmodel [5, 6, 7], for even p. Moreover, we proved almost sure convergence,\nwith respect to the quenched disorder, without taking the average. Subsequently, this strategy has been developed in [8] to include, among the others,\nthe REM [5] and GREM [9], and in [10], where finite connectivity models\nare considered. In the present paper, we generalize the strategy of [1] in a\ndifferent direction. The class of models for which we provide a proof of the\nexistence of the thermodynamic limit embraces, for instance, models where\nthe spin degrees of freedom \u03c3i have several components, which are not necessarily two-valued Ising variables. In the same way, we show how to treat the\ncase where a Curie-Weiss interaction term is added to the mean field spin\nglass Hamiltonian. Finally, the same results hold for a system composed of\nseveral replicas (i.e., identical copies with the same disorder realization) of\nthe mean field spin glass model, where replicas are coupled together by an\ninteraction term, which depends on their mutual overlaps. In all of these\ncases, when the method of [1] is naively applied, there appear terms which\nspoil the simple subadditivity argument which works for the SK and p-spin\nmodels. The main purpose of this paper is to show that the effect of these\npotentially dangerous terms can be eliminated, by suitably decomposing the\nconfiguration space. This idea was introduced by Michel Talagrand in [11],\nand developed in a series of important applications. Among these, Talagrand\nproposed a very interesting generalization of the broken replica bounds [12]\nto the case of systems made of two coupled replicas.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we introduce\nsome basic definitions concerning mean field spin glass models. In Section 3,\nwe state the main results of the paper, and we give some physically meaningful examples of models to which they can be applied. Section 4 contains\nthe proof of the results. Finally, Section 5 is dedicated to conclusions.\n\n2\n\nBasic definitions\n\nIn this Section, we recall some basic definitions concerning mean field spin\nglasses, without making reference to any specific model.\nThe generic configuration \u03c3 of the system is defined by N spin degrees\n2\n\n\fof freedom \u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . .. We suppose each \u03c3i to belong to a set S\u2208 Rn , n \u2208 N,\nequipped with an a priori measure \u03bd. For instance, the case S ={\u22121, +1}\nand \u03bd = 1/2(\u03b4\u22121 + \u03b4+1 ) corresponds to the usual Ising two-valued variables.\nThe Hamiltonian of the model, HN (\u03c3, J), depends on the spin configuration,\non the system size N and on some quenched disorder, which we denote as\nJ. Of course, the Hamiltonian can also depend on some additional external\nfields, e.g., on the magnetic field h. The mean field character of the model\nconsists in the condition that, if two configurations \u03c3 and \u03c3 \u2032 are connected\nby a permutation of the site indices, the random variables HN (\u03c3, J) and\nHN (\u03c3 \u2032 , J) have the same distribution.\nFor a given inverse temperature \u03b2, we introduce the disorder dependent\npartition function ZN (\u03b2, J), the quenched average of the free energy per site\nfN (\u03b2), and the Boltzmann-Gibbs state \u03c9J , according to the definitions\nZ\nZN (\u03b2, J) =\nd\u03bd(\u03c31 ) . . . d\u03bd(\u03c3N ) exp(\u2212\u03b2HN (\u03c3, J)),\n(1)\nSN\n\u22121\n\n\u2212\u03b2fN (\u03b2) = N\n\nE log ZN (\u03b2, J),\n(2)\nZ\nd\u03bd(\u03c31 ) . . . d\u03bd(\u03c3N )A(\u03c3) exp(\u2212\u03b2HN (\u03c3, J)), (3)\n\u03c9J (A) = ZN (\u03b2, J)\u22121\nSN\n\nwhere A is a generic function of the \u03c3's.\nLet us now introduce the important concept of replicas. Consider a\ngeneric number n of independent copies of the system, characterized by\n(1)\n(2)\nthe spin variables \u03c3i , \u03c3i , . . ., distributed according to the product of\nBoltzmann-Gibbs states\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(n)\n\n\u03a9J = \u03c9J \u03c9J . . . \u03c9J ,\n(\u03b1)\n\n(\u03b1)\n\nwhere each \u03c9J acts on the corresponding set of \u03c3i 's, and all replicas are\nsubject to the same sample J of the quenched disorder. For a generic smooth\nfunction F of the configuration of s replicas, we define the h.i averages as\nhF (\u03c3 (1) , \u03c3 (2) , . . .)i = E\u03a9J (F (\u03c3 (1) , \u03c3 (2) , . . .)),\nwhere the Boltzmann-Gibbs averages \u03a9J acts on the replicated \u03c3 variables,\nand E is the average with respect to the disorder J.\n\n3\n\nThe existence of the thermodynamic limit\n\nThe main object of interest in the theory is the quenched free energy fN (\u03b2).\nFirst of all, one would like to prove that it admits a well defined limit, for\nN \u2192 \u221e, independently from the explicit calculation of the limit itself.\n3\n\n\fWe restrict our analysis to the case of Gaussian models, i.e., models for\nwhich the HN (\u03c3, J) are (correlated) Gaussian random variables. Of course,\nthese random variables are fully characterized by their mean values\nbN (\u03c3) = EHN (\u03c3, J)\nand covariance matrix\ncN (\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 ) = E(HN (\u03c3, J)HN (\u03c3 \u2032 , J)) \u2212 E(HN (\u03c3, J))E(HN (\u03c3 \u2032 , J)).\nIn order to prove the existence of the thermodynamic limit, we suppose that\nthe following conditions are satisfied. First of all, we require that\nbN (\u03c3)\n(1)\n(k)\n= g(mN (\u03c3), . . . , mN (\u03c3)) + O(N \u22121 ).\nN\n\n(4)\n\n(i)\n\nHere, k \u2208 N, g is a smooth function of class C 1 and the mN (\u03c3) are bounded\n(i)\nfunctions, with NmN additive in the system size. In other words,\n(i)\n\n|mN (\u03c3)| \u2264 M\n\n\u2200i, N, \u03c3\n\n(5)\n\nand\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\nNmN (\u03c3) = N1 mN1 (\u03c3 (1) ) + N2 mN2 (\u03c3 (2) ),\n\n(6)\n\nif N = N1 + N2 and if the configuration \u03c3 can be decomposed as\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c3 = (\u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3N1 , \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3N2 ).\nAs for the covariance matrix, we require that\ncN (\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 )\n(1)\n(k)\n= f (QN (\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 ), . . . , QN (\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 )) + O(N \u22121 ),\nN\n\n(7)\n(i)\n\nwhere f is a convex function with continuous derivatives. The variables QN\nmust satisfy properties analogous to (5)-(6), i.e.,\n(i)\n\n|QN (\u03c3, \u03c3)| \u2264 M\n\n\u2200i, N, \u03c3\n\n(8)\n\nand\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\nNQN (\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 ) = N1 QN1 (\u03c3 (1) , \u03c3 \u2032(1) ) + N2 QN2 (\u03c3 (2) , \u03c3 \u2032(2) ).\n\n(9)\n\nIt is interesting to notice that the models considered in [1] have the additional properties that cN (\u03c3, \u03c3) does not depend on the configuration \u03c3, and\nthat g is a linear function.\nNow, we can state our result:\n4\n\n\fTheorem 1. If conditions (4) to (9) are satisfied, then the thermodynamic\nlimit of the quenched free energy exists:\nlim \u2212\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\n1\nE ln ZN (\u03b2) = f (\u03b2).\nN\u03b2\n\n(10)\n\nMoreover, the disorder dependent free energy converges almost surely, with\nrespect to the disorder realization:\nlim \u2212\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\n1\nln ZN (\u03b2) = f (\u03b2)\nN\u03b2\n\nJ \u2212 almost surely,\n\nand its disorder fluctuations can be estimated as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nNu2\nP \u2212\n,\nln ZN (\u03b2) \u2212 fN (\u03b2) \u2265 u \u2264 2 exp \u2212\nN\u03b2\n2L\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\nwhere\nL = max |f (x1 , . . . , xk )|,\n\n(13)\n\n|xi |\u2264M \u2200i\n\nand M is the same constant as in (8).\nRemark As explained in [1], from Eqs. (10)-(12) follows also the convergence, both under quenched average and J-almost surely, of the ground\nstate energy per site.\nBefore we turn to the proof of the Theorem, we give a few examples of\nphysically meaningful systems to which it applies.\n1. The SK model with non-Ising type spins, defined as\n1\nHN (\u03c3, J) = \u2212 \u221a\nN\n\nX\n\n1\u2264i<j\u2264N\n\nJij \u03c3i \u03c3j \u2212 h\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03c3i .\n\n(14)\n\ni=1\n\nHere, and in the following examples, the couplings Jij are independent identically distributed Gaussian random variables, with mean zero and unit variance, while h is the magnetic field. As for the spin degrees of freedom, we\nsuppose that \u03c3i \u2208 S = [\u2212a, a], while the measure \u03bd on S, which appears in\nthe definition of the partition function, is arbitrary. In this case,\nN\nbN (\u03c3)\nh X\n\u03c3i\n= \u2212h mN (\u03c3) = \u2212\nN\nN i=1\n\nand conditions P\n(4) to (6) are clearly satisfied, since |mN (\u03c3)| \u2264 a and the total\nmagnetization i \u03c3i is linear in the system size.

For simplicity, we assume that\nN \u22121 bN (\u03c3) = g(mN (\u03c3)) + O(N \u22121 ),\n8\n\n\fand\nN \u22121 cN (\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 ) = f (QN (\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 )) + O(N \u22121 ),\ncorresponding to the case k = 1 in Eqs. (4), (7), and that L = 1 in (13).\nThe general case can be obtained as a simple extension.\nFirst of all, we prove the existence of the limit along sequences of the\ntype {NK } = {N0 nK }, with n, N0 \u2208 N. As in [1], the idea is to find a\nsuitable interpolation between the original system, of size NK , and a system\ncomposed of n non interacting subsystems, of size NK\u22121 each. However, in\nthe present case, it is also necessary to divide the configuration space into\nsets, such that mN (\u03c3) and QN (\u03c3, \u03c3) are approximately constant within each\nset. The idea of restricting to the set of configurations with given overlap was\nintroduced by Michel Talagrand [11], and exploited in a series of important\napplications. For any 0 < \u03b5 < 1, we can write\n[1/\u03b5]\nX\n\nZNK (\u03b2) =\n\n(ij)\nZNK (\u03b2)\n\ni,j=0\n\n\u2261\n\n[1/\u03b5] Z\nX\n\ni,j=0\n\nd\u03bd\u0303(\u03c3) exp(\u2212\u03b2HNK (\u03c3, J)),\n\n(27)\n\nCij\n\nwhere\nCij = {\u03c3 \u2208 S NK : i\u03b5 \u2264 QNK (\u03c3, \u03c3), < (i+ 1)\u03b5, j\u03b5 \u2264 mNK (\u03c3), < (j + 1)\u03b5} (28)\nand [x] denotes the integer part of x. Since NK = nNK\u22121 , we can divide the\nsystem into n subsystems of NK\u22121 spins each, and we denote the configuration of the l-th subsystem as \u03c3 (l) , l = 1, 2, . . . , n. Of course, the following\ninequality holds\nZ\n(ij)\n(ij)\nZNK (\u03b2) \u2265 Z\u0303NK (\u03b2) =\nd\u03bd\u0303(\u03c3) exp(\u2212\u03b2HNK (\u03c3, J)),\n(29)\nC\u0303ij\n\nwhere\nCij \u2287 C\u0303ij = {\u03c3 \u2208 S NK : i\u03b5 \u2264 QNK\u22121 (\u03c3 (l) , \u03c3 (l) ) < (i + 1)\u03b5,\n\n(30)\n\nj\u03b5 \u2264 mNK\u22121 (\u03c3 (l) ) < (j + 1)\u03b5, \u2200l}.\n\nNow, we introduce an interpolating parameter 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1, and the auxiliary\npartition function\n(ij)\nZ\u0303NK (t, \u03b2)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nd\u03bd\u0303(\u03c3) exp \u03b2\n\nC\u0303ij\n\n\u2212(1 \u2212 t)\n\nn\nX\n\u221a\n\u221a\nl\n\u2212 t\u03beNK (\u03c3) \u2212 tbNK (\u03c3) \u2212 1 \u2212 t\n\u03beN\n(\u03c3 (l) )\nK\u22121\nl=1\n\nn\nX\n\n!\n\nbNK\u22121 (\u03c3 (l) ) ,\n\nl=1\n\n9\n\n\fl\nwhere the \u03beN\n(\u03c3) are n independent copies of the random variable \u03beN (\u03c3).\nClearly, for the boundary values of the parameter t one has\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n\n1\n\n(ij)\n\nNK \u03b2\n\nE ln Z\u0303NK (0, \u03b2) = \u2212\n\nNK\u22121 \u03b2\n\n(ij)\n\nE ln ZNK\u22121 (\u03b2)\n\n(31)\n\nand\n\u2212\n\n1\nNK \u03b2\n\n(ij)\n\nE ln Z\u0303NK (1, \u03b2) = \u2212\n\n1\nNK \u03b2\n\n(ij)\n\nE ln Z\u0303NK (\u03b2) \u2265 \u2212\n\n1\nNK \u03b2\n\n(ij)\n\nE ln ZNK (\u03b2).

Since QNK is a convex combination of the QNK\u22121 and f is a convex\nfunction, the term (34) is not positive. On the other hand, since f is a\nfunction of class C 1 , and QNK\u22121 (\u03c3 (l) , \u03c3 (l) ) and are constrained to belong to\nthe interval [i\u03b5, (i + 1)\u03b5) for each l, the term (33) is of order \u03b5.

Notice that, with respect to (37), the above inequality\ninvolves the original free energy, where the sum over over configuration has\nno restrictions. From (43), it follows that the thermodynamic limit exists,\n\u22121/4\nJ-almost surely, the term NK\nbeing inessential. On the other hand, the\nexponential estimate (12), together with Borel-Cantelli Lemma, implies that\nthe limit has a non random value f (\u03b2), for almost every disorder realization\nJ.\nOnce the almost sure convergence is proved, the convergence of the quenched\naverage can be obtained easily, provided that the probability that 1/N ln ZN\nassumes large values is sufficiently small. For instance, one has the following\n11\n\n\fcriterion [16]: given random variables XK and X, if XK \u2212\u2192 X almost surely\nfor K \u2192 \u221e, and if\nlim sup E (|XK | X ({|XK | \u2265 \u03bb})) = 0,\n\n\u03bb\u2192\u221e K\n\n(44)\n\nwhere X (A) denotes the characteristic function of the set A, then\nEXK \u2192 EX.\n\nIn the present case, XK = \u2212(1/NK \u03b2) ln ZNK (\u03b2), X = f (\u03b2), and the condition (44) can be easily checked, by employing the exponential bound (12).\nIn conclusion, we have proved almost sure convergence for the free energy,\nand convergence of its quenched average, for any subsequence of the form\n{N0 nK }. It is not difficult to show, by standard methods, that this implies\nconvergence along any increasing subsequence {NK }, and the uniqueness of\nthe limit. \u2737\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper, we have extended the class of mean field spin glass models for\nwhich the existence of the thermodynamic limit can be proved, independently\nof an explicit calculation of the limit itself. Essentially, with respect to the\nmodels considered in [1], one abandons the assumption that the variance of\nthe Hamiltonian is independent of the configuration, and that its mean value\nis additive in the size of the system. Some of the hypotheses of the Theorem,\nlike the uniform bounds (5), (8), are required only for technical reasons, but\ncan be dispensed with, at the expense of some extra work. On the other\nhand, the condition of convexity for the covariance function is essential, so\nthat our result does not extend directly, for instance, to the p-spin model,\nwith p odd.\nAcknowledgments\nWe gratefully acknowledge useful conversations with Pierluigi Contucci,\nSandro Graffi, Giorgio Parisi and Michel Talagrand.\nThis work was supported in part by MIUR (Italian Minister of Instruction, University and Research), and by INFN (Italian National Institute for\nNuclear Physics).\n\nReferences\n[1] F.
