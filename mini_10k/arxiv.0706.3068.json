Infrared: galaxies - Galaxies: photometry\n\n1. Introduction\nDeep infrared surveys performed with ISOCAM\n(Cesarsky et al. 1996) aboard ESA's ISO satellite\n(Kessler et al. 1996) have greatly increased our knowledge of the faint IR background (e.g. Aussel et al. 1999).\nFrom dust emission, the mid-infrared (MIR) is an ideal\nwavelength domain to study the fundamental process\nof star formation at cosmological distances. There is\nalso evidence for strong evolution of sources in the MIR\nincluding recent results from ISO and Spitzer satellites (Appleton et al. 2004; Pozzi et al. 2004). However,\nprogress in this area has been complicated by technical\nSend offprint requests to: Nick Seymour, email: seymour@ipac.caltech.edu\n\u22c6\nBased on observations collected at the European Southern\nObservatory (ESO), La Silla, Chile, and on observations with\nISO, an ESA project with instruments funded by ESA Member\nStates (especially the PI countries: France, Germany, the\nNetherlands and the United Kingdom) and with the participation of ISAS and NASA.\n\u22c6\u22c6\nTable 4 is only available in electronic form at the CDS\nvia anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via\nhttp://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/\n\ndifficulties in reducing the ISOCAM data. Despite the\nrecent advances of Spitzer, there is still a great deal of\ninformation to be extracted from the ISOCAM data.\nWhen examining faint sources with ISOCAM, to be\nconfident in the reliability of a source, one must be sure\nto have removed all sources of flux variation above the\nbackground noise which are not due to astronomical objects. Principle amongst these are 'glitches' caused by cosmic ray impacts on the SiGa detector. There is additional\ntransient behavior comprising long term transients which\nare effectively slow variations in the background, and short\nterm transients which occur when a pixel moves on and\noff a source causing an upward or downward transient respectively. This memory effect is an unfortunate property\nof the type of detectors available at the time of ISOCAM's\ndevelopment. The temporal shape of this lagged response\nafter a flux step has been corrected by a technique developed by Abergel et al. (1996) which successfully removes transients due to strong sources or changes in illumination. Then the software developed by Starck et al.\n(1999) known as PRETI (Pattern REcognition Technique\nfor ISOCAM data) was designed to identify and remove\n\n\f2\n\nSeymour, Rocca-Volmerange and de Lapparent: 12\u03bcm ISOCAM of the ESS\n\nthe other artifacts due to cosmic rays effects and residual\nlow frequency variations.\nThe ultimate flux density calibration of ISOCAM has\nalso been subject of much research. Great care is not\nonly needed to distinguish real astronomical sources from\nother transient effects in the detectors, but also in calculating the true flux density of these objects. A detailed analysis of the behavior of the detector was applied to ISO observations of the Hubble Deep Field (HDF)\nwhich used the LW2 (6.75\u03bcm) and LW3 (15\u03bcm) filters\n(Aussel et al. 1999) and was found to be successful at removing most types of transients significantly above the\nnoise. The results of this analysis, although largely consistent at bright flux densities, are considerably different\nat fainter flux densities from those previously derived by\nSerjeant et al. (1997) from the same observations (there\nis however reasonable consistency with a further analysis\nof D\u00e9sert et al. 1999). The method of Aussel et al. (1999)\ninvolved PRETI to identify and correct the cosmic rays\neffects as well as to removing the low frequency variation\nof the background left after applying the Abergel method;\nmany simulations were performed to test the completeness and flux density calibration of these data. Another\napproach, which is empirical and does not depend on simulations, is that of Efstathiou et al. (2000) who used stars\nto calibrate their ISOPHOT 90\u03bcm survey. V\u00e4is\u00e4nen et al.\n(2002) and Oliver et al. (2002) also used stars to calibrate\ntheir ISOCAM LW2 and LW3 observations. Furthermore\nClements et al. (1999) used observations of stars to verify\ntheir flux density calibration.\nOver the last few years, the Lari method (Lari et al.\n2001) has been successfully applied to other surveys\n(Gruppioni et al. 2002; Pozzi et al. 2003; Vaccari et al.\n2005). This technique involves a full analysis of the history of each pixel and much simulation. We did not use\nthis method in our desire to avoid simulations, but we\nnote that several of these papers (Gruppioni et al. 2002;\nVaccari et al. 2005), as well as the more recent work of\nRodighiero et al. (2004), use the well known IR properties of normal stars to verify their flux density calibration.\nHere, we present ISOCAM observations which were\ndesigned to cover the portion of the ESO-Sculptor faint\ngalaxy redshift survey (ESS; Arnouts et al. 1997) which is\nleast affected by the cirrus confusion noise. The ISOCAM\narea was selected using the IPAC/IRSKY software which\nmeasured a mean sky flux density of 18.78 mJy/arcmin2\nat 12 \u03bcm and a rms of 5.42 mJy/arcmin2 ; these values\nwere measured in 1.5 arcmin pixels in a large field of view\nof 90\u2032 \u00d790\u2032 centered on the ESS field. We also estimate the\ncolour excess as 0.014 < EB\u2212V < 0.022 on the survey area\n(Schlegel et al. 1998). The ESO-Sculptor Survey is located\nclose to the South Galactic Pole, and covers a strip of approximately 0.24 \u00d7 1.53 deg = 0.37 deg2 with CCD photometry complete to Johnson-Cousins B = 24.5, V = 24.0\nand Rc = 23.5. The ESS also provides a nearly complete\nredshift sample to Rc = 20.5 (de Lapparent et al. 2003,\n2004) over a sub-region of 0.24 \u00d7 1.02 deg = 0.25 deg2 .\nISOCAM-ESS thus provides a unique complement to the\n\nother existing surveys in its combination of i) \u223c 700 square\narcminute sky area, ii) BV Rc CCD photometry and NIR\n(DENIS and 2MASS) photometry, and iii) spectroscopic\ncompleteness to Rc = 20.5.\nIn the following, we present the data reduction and\ncalibration of ISOCAM-ESS. The observations were performed with the \u223c 12 \u03bcm LW10 ISOCAM filter which was\ndesigned to have a similar passband as the IRAS 12 \u03bcm\nband. This similarity allows us to take advantage of the\nflux density calibration of the IRAS data. In Sect. 2, we\nfirst describe the adopted procedure for source extraction\n(Sect. 2.1) and astrometry (Sect. 2.2). This analysis is followed by the flux density re-calibration in the Sect. 3. We\nprovide the complete source catalogue in Sect. 4.\n\n2. Observations and Data Reduction\nThe ISOCAM observations consist of 10 overlapping\nraster observations arranged in a 5 \u00d7 2 configuration centered on RA (J2000) 00h 22m 23.06s and Dec (J2000) \u221230\u25e6\n04\u2032 55.65\u2032\u2032. Each of the 10 rasters (see Table 1) is composed of M \u00d7 N pointings (with M = N = 8) of the\nlong wavelength (LW) detector of ISOCAM, each offset by\ndM = dN = 60\u2032\u2032 along the axis of the detector. Table 2\nshows the parameters which were constant for all observations. Each pointing of the 32 \u00d7 32 pixel detector used the\n6\u2032\u2032 pixel field of view (PFOV) mirror so that the detector's\nview at each pointing was a 192\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 192\u2032\u2032 area of the sky.\nThe total field of view of the ISOCAM survey is therefore\napproximately 0.3\u00d70.8 deg2 intersecting over \u223c 80% of the\nESS spectroscopic area. For ISO observations it was not\npossible to request a particular orientation of the camera.\nIn the event our observations were performed at \u223c 45 deg\nto the axes of the 5 \u00d7 2 arrangement of the observations\n(see Fig. 1).\nThis arrangement left four very small patches of \u223c 20\u2032\u2032\ndiameter unobserved by ISOCAM, which are aligned at\nthe middle declination of the ISO pointings Dec(J2000)\n\u221230\u25e6 04\u2032 50\u2032\u2032 and have the following values of RA(J2000):\n0h 23m 15.4s , 0h 22m 40.2s , 0h 22m 5.2s , 0h 22m 30.2s (these 4\npatches are barely visible in Fig. 1).\nWe used the latest version of the original raw data\nfiles obtained from the ISO Data Archive1 , corresponding\nto the 10 raster pointings with the most up-to-date FITS\nheader information. The data reduction was largely done\nwith the ISOCAM Interactive Users Analysis System,\ncalled CIA (Ott et al. 1997).\nAt this stage, PRETI (Starck et al. 1999) was run\nwithin the CIA/IDL environment to remove the cosmic\nrays effects and residual variation of the background, after\nsubtracting the transients, to perform the flat correction\nand to suppress the time-varying baseline. We used the\ntransient correction for the on-source detector response\nas described in Abergel et al. (1996).

The two horizontal lines mark the region covered by the ESS.\nare given in Sect. 3 on the flux density calibration). The 64\nindependent pointings of each raster were then projected\nonto the sky allowing for the known distortion of the sky\ndue to the optics of ISOCAM.\nAlthough the original pixel size of the individual exposures was 6\u2032\u2032 , each raster image was finely re-sampled\nto 2\u2032\u2032 in order to increase the accuracy of the sky projection. Finally, the 10 raster pointing images were combined\non the sky plane producing an image map and a map of\nthe associated rms error at each pixel (henceforth referred\nto as the \"noise\" map). The final pixel size of these maps,\nfrom the re-projection of the ten raster images, was chosen\nto be 3\u2032\u2032 as a compromise between retaining the accurate\nhigh resolution of the sky projection and possible lightly\n\nover-sampling the PSF whose FWHM is of order of the\noriginal 6\u2032\u2032 pixels. We note that some additional correlated noise and potential small positional errors maybe\nintroduced by a second re-sampling of the image.\n\n2.1. Source Extraction\nISOCAM observations require specifically designed source\nextraction algorithms, as the noise in raster data is correlated and varies across the field. This effect is especially\nnoticeable near the edge of a raster where there are fewer\nreadouts per sky position; as a result, the border regions\nof the survey are noisier than the central part. One must\ntherefore use the corresponding \"noise\" map to determine\n\n\f4\n\nSeymour, Rocca-Volmerange and de Lapparent: 12\u03bcm ISOCAM of the ESS\n\nTable 2.

(1999), and which\nis implemented in their Multi-Resolution (MR) software.\nThis method searches for objects on different scales in\nwavelet space using the so called '\u00e0 trous' algorithm (we\nrefer the reader to Starck et al. 1999 for full details).\nWe apply the Multi-Resolution software with a detection threshold of 5\u03c4w where \u03c4w is the noise level in wavelet\nspace. \u03c4w is not directly equivalent to the dispersion of\nGaussian data but gives a qualitative idea of the significance of our detection. The ultimate limit to the detection\nof sources is the rate at which false detections occur due\nto residual glitches in the noise which are too faint to be\nremoved by PRETI. Starck et al. (1999) performed simulations to assess the reliability of their data and obtained\na 2% false detection rate at the completeness limit (5\u03c4w ).\nHere we choose to perform the simple test of applying\nthe source extraction to the negative of our sky image for\ndifferent thresholds. We detect no sources in the negative\nimages above 4.5\u03c4w . Hence we believe our detections to be\nquite robust, although we cannot quantify our false detection rate. We note, though, that we find optical counterparts to all our 12 \u03bcm sources covered by the ESS within\n6\u2032\u2032 and with R < 25 (see Sect. 3). If randomly distributed\nwe would have expected only 30% to have had optical\ncounterparts within 6\u2032\u2032 .\nUsing the mrdetect task from MR with a PSF model\nsampled at 3\u2032\u2032 , and a detection threshold of 5\u03c4w , we search\nfor objects down to the 4th wavelet scale and obtain 142\nsources to a detection limit of \u223c 0.24 mJy. This limit corresponds to the integrated flux density, reconstructed by\nthe wavelet detection program, of the faintest object detected. The final source catalogue, after astrometry and\nflux density re-calibration, is presented in Sect. 4.\nWith the final goal of validating the adopted extraction\nmethod suited to raster data with ISO, we also investigate\nthe application of SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996)\nto our field. For a high, approximately equivalent detection\nthreshold of \u223c 5\u03c3, SExtractor finds far fewer sources\nthan MR. Of those sources found by SExtractor, only\n\n90% are also found by MR. This percentage then decreases rapidly with lower thresholds (i.e. 75% at \u223c 3\u03c3).\nAdditionally, the consistent sources in both catalogues are\nfound to have a random rms offset of \u223c 1.5\u2032\u2032 in their position. These offsets are most likely due to the different\nstrategies of the two different codes, as MR searches for\nstructure in wavelet space and SExtractor searches the\nstandard sky-plane. When compared to the list of ESS\noptical sources, we find that the SExtractor positions\nare marginally more accurate than those measured by MR\n(rms of 2.0\u2032\u2032 instead of 2.75\u2032\u2032 ). This comparison thus confirms that a standard source extraction algorithm such as\nSExtractor cannot compete with an extraction technique specifically designed for ISOCAM data, such as MR.\n\n2.2. Astrometry\nA first check of the astrometry is obtained by crosscorrelation of our ISOCAM source list with the ESS bright\nobjects (Rc < 21) located within 6\u2032\u2032 . We obtain an rms\noffset of 2\u2032\u2032 with no systematic offset, thus indicating that\nthe absolute astrometry for both ISOCAM and ESS catalogues are reliable.\nTo obtain an independent astrometric calibration, we\nalso searched for another infrared catalogue. The closest available data in wavelength is the 2 Micron All Sky\nSurvey (2MASS) which includes J, H and crucially K\u2013\nband at 2\u03bcm. As the 2MASS and ISOCAM observations\nwere taken within a few years of each other, the proper\nmotion of stars (which make up most of the sources used\nfor the astrometry) is unlikely to be a problem. We crosscorrelate our ISOCAM list with the 2MASS Point Source\nCatalogue to search for objects within 3\u2032\u2032 of each other.\nThis correlation yields 34 ISOCAM objects with firm detections and provisional flux densities above 0.6 mJy which\nwere also detected in the Ks -band. We then use these\nsources with the xtran task in aips to modify the header\nof the FITS file of the image and rms map. This modification leads to a maximum change of 0.3\u2032\u2032 to the positions\nof the 142 final catalogue objects across the field and a\n0.1\u2032\u2032 improvement in the rms offset with respect to the\nESS catalogue.\n\n3. Flux Density Calibration\nAlthough selected to be far from the galactic plane, the\nrelatively large area of the ESS field provides a sample\nof stars of various types sufficient to estimate the empirical flux density calibration of the ISOCAM observations. This areal size is a significant advantage compared\nto most other medium/deep ISOCAM surveys (e.g. the\nISO Hubble Deep Field North which covers only \u223c 27\nsquare arcminutes of the sky and thus contains only a few\ncalibrating stars2 ).\n2\n\nWe note that the HDF South (Oliver et al. 2002), which is\nof a similar size, was calibrated using seven stars due to it's\nlow galactic latitude.\n\n\fSeymour, Rocca-Volmerange and de Lapparent: 12\u03bcm ISOCAM of the ESS\n\nTable 3.

Due to the high galactic latitude of our survey,\nthe low extinction E(B \u2212 V ) \u223c 0.02 affects very little\nthese colour-colour relations. For example, the B to R\u2013\nband flux density ratio varies by less than 5%, and this\npercentage is lower for flux density ratios of longer wavelength bands.\nIn the following sub-sections, we describe the various\nstages of our calibration procedure. We first obtain for\nthe detected ISOCAM sources optical and NIR magnitudes by cross-identification with the ESS and various\nother existing catalogues (Sect. 3.1). We then use colourcolour diagrams to identify stars among the ISOCAM\nsources (Sect. 3.2). The core of the calibration strategy\nuses a fitting procedure (D. Le Borgne, private communication) to search for the best fit stellar template from\nthe P\u00c9GASE library (Sect. 3.3). We use the colours of\nthe best fit templates to predict 12 \u03bcm flux densities from\nknown IRAS colour-colour relations Waters et al. 1987,\n(hereafter WCA) and then convert to an ISO flux density.\n\n3.1. Optical and NIR cross-identification\nThe optical and NIR magnitudes are taken from a variety\nof sources:\n1. Deep B, V and Rc -band data from ESS (including\nthe Sextractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) stellarity\nindex - an indication of how similar a source is to the\n\n5\n\npoint-spread function, i.e. star-like or extended like a\ngalaxy (see Arnouts et al. 1997 for more details).\n2. B, R and I\u2013 band data from the USNO B catalogue\n(when B and R\u2013 band data are unavailable due to either saturation in the ESS, or masking of ESS diffraction spikes, or because the object is outside the ESS\nfield). It should be noted that USNO magnitudes are\nphotographic, but for convenience we use them later\nwith the labels B, R and I\u2013 band .\n3. I\u2013 band data from the DENIS Survey3 Extended\nSource Catalogue (ESC). We use the ESC as DENIS\nis deep enough to detect more galaxies than stars.\n4. J, H and Ks -band from the 2MASS Point Source\nCatalogue (PSC). We use the PSC as only the brighter\nISOCAM sources will be detected and will mainly be\nstars.\nWe first correlate the 12 \u03bcm source list with the ESS\ncatalogue using a 6\u2032\u2032 search radius which gives 111 objects\nout of 142 with one or more potential optical counterparts.\nFor sources with one or more optical counterpart we took\nthe nearer the counterpart which in 11 out of 12 times was\nthe brighter of two. The other source with two counterparts seemed to be an interacting pair of equal brightness\nin the optical images.\nThe remaining 31 objects are correlated with the\nUSNO B catalogue in a similar fashion. This correlation\nleads to 23 further optical counterparts which include objects either outside the ESS field, or cut out of the ESS due\nto saturation or masking. This list of 134 optical sources\nis then correlated with the 2MASS data using the optical position and a 1\u2032\u2032 search radius, yielding 41 crossidentifications. I\u2013 band magnitudes from DENIS are also\nfound for 79 sources with the same search radius. The\nmore accurate DENIS I\u2013 band is used in preference to\nthe USNO photographic I\u2013 band when available. There remains 7 objects which are too faint to be detected in either\nUSNO, 2MASS or DENIS catalogues: sources 100 & 110\nare masked by diffraction spikes in the ESS and sources\n12, 51, 81, 114 & 137 are not coincident with the ESS\narea. One source (source 44) is only detected in 2MASS.\nHence all ISOCAM sources covered by ESS have optical\ncounterparts with R < 25.\n\n3.2. Star/galaxy separation and normal star selection\n3.2.1. H \u2212 Ks versus J \u2212 Ks\nWe use the following colour/colour diagrams to separate\nstars from galaxies. For all 41 objects with 2MASS counterpart, we select stars by examining their NIR colours\nusing the criteria\nH \u2212 Ks < 0.30\n\n(1)\n\nJ \u2212 Ks < 1.0\n\n(2)\n\n3\n\nhttp://www-denis.iap.fr/\n\n\f6\n\nSeymour, Rocca-Volmerange and de Lapparent: 12\u03bcm ISOCAM of the ESS\n\nfor normal stars from Bessell & Brett (1988). This selection is illustrated in Fig. 2 and yields a separated subgroup of 22 objects. Note the ESS misidentified galaxy\nwith H \u2212 Ks \u223c 0.1 in this plot and others (object 13 in\nTable 4). In Fig. 4 this object has a quite extreme position\nand is likely a very cool star with a large MIR excess.\n\n3.2.2. H \u2212 Ks versus Ks \u2212 [12]\nTo check for MIR excess due to dust and circumstellar\nmaterial, we examine H \u2212 Ks versus Ks \u2212 [12]. The IRAS\nExplanatory Supplement4 provides a zero magnitude flux\ndensity of 28.3 Jy for the 12 \u03bcm magnitude. However, this\nvalue is not technically correct as it was obtained by assuming that Vega is a blackbody from 10.6 \u03bcm to 12 \u03bcm,\nwhereas Vega has quite a large IR excess which affects\nboth the 10.6 \u03bcm flux density and the spectrum. Here\nwe adopt a value of 40.141 Jy from Cohen et al. (1992).\nTherefore:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nF Jy\n(3)\n[12] = \u22122.5 \u00d7 log\n40.141\n\nFig. 2. NIR colour-colour diagram of 40/41 objects with\n2MASS counterparts (minus one objects with extreme\nH \u2212 K colour, \u223c 2, which lies off the plot). The symbols refer to the stellarity index from the ESS (see text):\ncircles are galaxies, open stars are stars and crosses are\nobjects without counterpart in the ESS. The solid lines\nrepresent the selection criteria of stars from Eqs. 1 & 2.\n\nAmong the 41 2MASS counterparts, 19 of the 22 stars\nselected previously are in a cloud defined by 0 < H \u2212Ks <\n0.3 and \u22120.5 < Ks \u2212 [12] < 0.5 (see Fig. 3) and are unambiguously detected with a single optical/NIR counterpart\nwithin 3\u2032\u2032 . The other 5 objects with H \u2212 K < 0.4, but\nK \u2212 [12] > 1.5 are stars from the group of 22 with MIR\nexcess.\n\n3.2.3. log(f12 /fR ) versus log(fB /fR )\nTo extend the analysis to objects too faint to be detected\nby 2MASS (for which we have no NIR data) we examine\nthe positions of all objects in a optical-MIR colour-colour\ndiagram, shown in Fig. 4. On this diagram is marked\nthe loci of blackbodies with a temperature ranging from\n3000K (upper right) to 104 K (lower left). The 14 objects\nnear the blackbody line are normal stars without IR excess; they define the subsample that we analyse with the\nfitting procedure. All the 14 objects belong to the subset\nof 19 objects with Ks \u2212 [12] \u223c 0 and H \u2212 Ks \u223c 0 \u2212 0.25\nin Fig. 3. The remaining 5 objects are: i) 4 of the 5\nSextractor stars identified in the ESS which lie immediately above the blackbody line and ii) the misidentified\ngalaxy to the right of the graph with log(fB /fR ) \u223c 3.\nThe fifth star in the row above the blackbody line (with\nlog(fB /fR ) = 0.1) has Ks \u2212 [12] \u223c 1.5 and hence does not\nsatisfy the NIR/MIR colour selection criteria. Note that\nthere are no objects previously not identified as stars in\nthe lower part of Fig. 4. Therefore, among all the objects\nwith optical counterparts, we identify from the colourcolour diagrams only 22 stars (i.e. all and only those selected in Fig. 2). With no further information available\nthe 7 ISOCAM sources without either an optical or NIR\ncounterpart are assumed to be galaxies.\n4\n\nhttp://spider.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/tchester/exp.sup/\n\nFig. 3.

The symbols are the same as in\nFig. 2\n\nAt this stage we change the DENIS i\u2212 band magnitudes from the ESC to the PSC for all 22 sources found\nto be stars.\n\n3.3. Template fitting\nFor the template fitting we use the stellar library from\nthe P\u00c9GASE.2 (http://www2.iap.fr/pegase) code. This\nlibrary has a significant coverage of the HR diagram. It is\nbased on the Kurucz library rearranged by Lejeune et al.\n(1997): BaSel-2.0 (see Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange 1987, for\ndetails). The chi-squared fitting routine is applied to the\n14 objects of the selected subsample, all have BRIJHKs\nmagnitudes with the B, R and I\u2013 band magnitudes from\nthe USNO catalogue, not the ESS catalogue, as they were\n\n\fSeymour, Rocca-Volmerange and de Lapparent: 12\u03bcm ISOCAM of the ESS\n\nFig. 4. Optical-MIR colour-colour diagram of all objects\nwith optical (ESS/USNO) counterparts. The symbols are\nthe same as in Figs. 2 & 3, but with the caveat that R\nand B\u2013 band magnitudes with no stellarity index are from\nthe USNO catalogue (i.e. the crosses). The solid line represents the loci of blackbodies with a temperature ranging from 3000K to 10000K for the Johnson-Cousins system. We note this line would vary by < 0.1dex for the\nUSNO filter system. Furthermore, there are 7 ISOCAM\nsources (three misidentified, open stars, and four unknown, crosses) not in the ESS with log f12 /fR \u223c 10 which\nare assumed to be galaxies.\n\nall saturated or off the ESS field. The 2MASS pass-bands\ncome from the 2MASS web-page5. The USNO pass-bands\n(from the Palomar Sky Survey and approximately equivalent to Johnson B, R and I\u2013 band) were taken from\nReid et al. (1991). We remind the reader that the extinction is low enough in this area of sky that its effect on the\ncurrent analysis is small, <\n\u223c 5% in the optical and less at\nlonger wavelengths.\nThe chi-squared fitting of the sample of 14 normal stars\nis carried out in a 3 dimensional parameter space: effective temperature (Teff ), surface gravity (g) and metallicity\n(Z/Z0 ). The fits are constrained by the errors of each magnitude: 0.05 mag for 2MASS, \u223c 0.05 mag for DENIS, and\n0.25 mag for USNO. The \u03c72 exhibit a sharp minimum as a\nfunction of Teff and with a reasonable dependence on the\nsurface gravity. For 13 out of the 14 stars, best-fit templates have \u03c72 < 1.7 (the 14th star has \u03c72 = 4.0 so we\nexclude it from our sample). We show in Fig. 5 the stellar\nfit with the largest \u03c72 (\u03c72 = 1.68). The input magnitudes\nof the 13 stars are listed in Tables 3 and 4, along with the\nbest fit values of the gravity, the metallicity, the effective\ntemperature, and corresponding value of \u03c72 .\nFigure 5 illustrates that the NIR region of the SED\nis more constrained due the higher accuracies of the NIR\nmagnitudes (IJHKs ). This wavelength range corresponds\nto the region in which the effective temperature is essentially defined, as it is the Wien-tail of the blackbody spec5\n\nwww.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/releases/allsky/index.html\n\n7\n\nFig. 5. Result of the stellar fitting to ISOCAM source\n20 from Table 4. The open diamonds with error bars are\nthe observation magnitudes (BRIJHKs bands) whilst the\nsolid circles are the magnitudes of the best fit template\n(line) with \u03c72 = 1.68. Details of this fit are given in the\npanel below the plot. Although the fit is less constrained at\nshorter wavelengths due to the larger photometric errors\nin the USNO survey, it depends only weakly on this part\nof the spectrum (see text).\n\ntrum. From Fig. 5, one might expect that there would\nbe many other stellar templates consistent with this fit,\nbut with a different SED below 0.8\u03bcm. Although these\ndifferent optical SEDs would probably not change the effective temperature by much it could considerably affect\nthe optical colours, B \u2212 V and R \u2212 I, which the WCA\ncolour-colour relations use (see Sects. 3.4). To investigate\nthis effect, we reran the fitting procedure to all 14 stars\nwithout using the B and R\u2013 band magnitudes (i.e. without constraining the fit below I\u2013 band wavelengths). In all\ncases but one, the effective temperatures changes by only\none step in parameter space (200 \u2212 250K) and the SEDs\nbelow I\u2013 band are generally consistent with those derived\nusing the B and R\u2013 band magnitudes; similar values of\nB \u2212 V and R \u2212 I colours are also obtained. The one case\nwhich has a considerably different effective temperature\nand SED is found to be almost degenerate with 2 sharp\ntroughs in \u03c72 parameter space, the slightly higher of the\n\u03c72 corresponding to the original 6 band fit; the other fit\ncan easily be discarded as it is inconsistent with the observed B and R\u2013 band magnitudes. Therefore, we conclude\nthat the large errors of the B and R\u2013 band magnitudes do\nnot significantly deteriorate the quality of the fits.\n\n3.4. Predicted Flux\nAlthough the BaSeL-2.0 stellar libraries do extend to MIR\nwavelengths they have not be widely tested, and then only\nat brighter flux densities (e.g. Cohen et al. 2003, using the\nKurucz templates for certain A0-AV5 stars). We decide\nto use empirical stellar colours to verify the calibration\n\n\f8\n\nSeymour, Rocca-Volmerange and de Lapparent: 12\u03bcm ISOCAM of the ESS\n\nof our flux densities and use the long-wavelength part of\nthe stellar template as a consistency check. We use the\ntwo colour-colour relationships of WCA to derive 12 \u03bcm\nflux densities. These WCA relations are for IRAS 12 \u03bcm\nflux densities of stars which specifically relate the V \u2212 [12]\ncolour with B \u2212 V and R \u2212 I:\nV \u2212 [12] = 0.05 + 3.13(B \u2212 V )\n+ 0.29(B \u2212 V )3\n\n\u2212 1.26(B \u2212 V )2\n(4)\n+ 0.16(B \u2212 V )4\n\nand\nV \u2212 [12] = 4.33(R \u2212 I) + 0.14 for (R \u2212 I) < 0.72\n\n(5)\n\nV \u2212 [12] = 2.69(R \u2212 I) + 1.40 for (R \u2212 I) > 0.72\n\n(6)\n\nThese relationships were derived from IRAS observations of bright normal stars. We convert from magnitudes\nto flux density using the 40.141 Jy IRAS 12 \u03bcm zero point\nof Cohen et al. (1992). This zero point is very similar\nto the value used in Cohen et al. (1987) who obtained\nV \u2212 [12] colours in agreement with the WCA colours.\nThe ISOCAM LW10 filter was designed to have a similar wavelength-dependent response as the IRAS 12 \u03bcm\nband6 , but they are not identical. The ISO 12 \u03bcm filter\nhas a redder blue cutoff than the the IRAS 12 \u03bcm filter.\nUsing these relationships we obtain predicted IRAS flux\ndensities and which we can then convert to ISO flux densities, by the ratios of the colour corrections for the stars.\nISO\nIRAS\nThe ratio of colour corrections, K12\n\u03bcm /K12\u03bcm , as defined\nin the respective handbooks7 is computed by the authors\nto be 1.11 for stars of temperatures 2000-10000 K. Hence\nwe convert the IRAS to ISO flux densities by dividing the\npredicted WCA flux densities by this factor.\nThe V magnitudes and B \u2212 V , R \u2212 I colours which\nwe use when applying Eqs. 4, 5 and 6 to the 13 stars\nlisted in Table 3, are those derived directly from best-fit\ntemplate spectra. We apply for each star both relationships, thus yielding 2 estimates of the 12 \u03bcm magnitude.\nEq. 3 subsequently gives us 2 estimates of the flux density,\nfrom which we derive an average flux density. The ratio of\nthis predicted ISOCAM flux density to the initially measured ISOCAM flux density, i.e. the observed flux density,\nis plotted in Fig. 6. We find a mean value of 1.01 \u00b1 0.17\nwhich we also mark in Fig. 6. This mean value of the flux\ndensity ratios includes the factor of 1.11 due to the colour\ncorrections. The ratios presented in Fig. 6 indicate that,\nfor our observational setup at least, the flux densities are\nsystematically overestimated for the normal stars, with\nno apparent systematic variation in the offset value with\n12 \u03bcm flux density. Due to the large PSF of these ISOCAM\nobservations, 6\u2032\u2032 , slightly extended sources (galaxies) have\na similar response to the detector as unresolved (stars)\nand hence we apply this correction to our entire catalogue\n6\n\nsee http://www.iso.vilspa.esa.es/users/handbook/\n7\nIRAS: irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/IRASdocs/exp.sup/ and\nISO: www.iso.esac.esa.int/manuals/HANDBOOK/.\n\nFig. 6. Ratio of predicted ISOCAM 12 \u03bcm flux density\n(from template fitting and the relationships of WCA) to\n\"observed\" ISOCAM flux density plotted against observed\n12 \u03bcm magnitude. The mean ratio is indicated by the horizontal solid line.\n(see Table 4). Furthermore, the 1.01 correction factor is\nnot too dissimilar to the combined flux density correction\nfound by Rodighiero et al. (2004) of 0.84 (from the combination of their projection bias, mosaic bias and stellar\nflux density correction: 0.84 \u00d7 0.915 \u00d7 1.097 = 0.84).\nWe are confident we have successfully excluded all stars\nwhich exhibit unusual properties (e.g. Be-stars or those\nwith dust around them). As a test, we also calculate the\nratio of predicted to observed flux density using using the\n12 \u03bcm flux density derived from the Kurucz stellar template. The ratio for the Kurucz template flux density is\n1.05 \u00b1 0.18. We note that the Kurucz value is within good\nagreement with the value from our template fitting procedure, given the error bars, suggesting that the Kurucz\nmodels are not too far off at MIR wavelengths.\n\n4. The 12 \u03bcm Source Catalogue\nTable 4 lists the full flux density-calibrated 12 \u03bcm catalogue of 142 sources detected by ISOCAM above the minimum integrated flux density of 0.24 mJy. All available\noptical and NIR data are also given as well as classification (star/galaxy) and the source of the optical data. This\ncatalogue is used to compute the faint galaxy counts at\n12\u03bcm in the companion paper (Rocca-Volmerange et al.\n2007). A complementary paper on the luminosity function\nat 12 \u03bcm is in preparation.\nThe uncertainties in the 12 \u03bcm flux density in Table 4\n(column [16]) are obtained using:\ns\u0012 \u0013\n\u00132\n\u0012\n2\n0.047\ndS\n\u03b4S12\n\u2243\n+\n(7)\nS12\nS\n1.01\nThe first term in the quadratic sum is the original relative\nuncertainty in flux density provided by the source count\nextraction with the MR software. The second term results\nfrom the uncertainty in the 1.01 mean correction factor\n\n\fSeymour, Rocca-Volmerange and de Lapparent: 12\u03bcm ISOCAM of the ESS\n\napplied to the MR flux density (see Sect. 3.4): as the 1.01\nfactor is measured over 13 data points (see Fig. 6) with an\nrms dispersion of 0.17 around\nthe mean, we approximate\n\u221a\nits uncertainty to 0.17/ 13 = 0.047.\nOnly the first 10 lines of the catalogue are presented\nhere. The full catalogue is available on the online version\nof this article.\n\n5. Survey completeness\nIn order to use our ISOCAM source catalogue to derive\ngalaxy numbers counts, one needs to evaluate the completeness of the catalogue as a function of flux density.\nWe use two independent empirical methods. Firstly, we\nuse the same method as used in the previous section to\ndetermine the flux density of stars (Sect. 3), which we extend to those stars not detected by ISOCAM. The second\nmethod is based on the optical counterparts to galaxies associated with ISOCAM sources, but detected with lower\nsignificance, in the interval 3\u03c4w to 5\u03c4w .\n\n5.1. Completeness from stars\nThe method is based on the following stages: i) selecting\nstars from the 2MASS catalogue using their NIR colours,\nii) confirming that they are stars by template fitting (as in\nSect. 3.3) and iii) using the results of the fitting to predict\nthe 12 \u03bcm flux density from the optical colours.\nWe select stars from the 2MASS catalogue as all objects with H \u2212 K < 0.3, J \u2212 K < 1 and K < 14 within\nthe area of the ISOCAM field. The two colour criteria are\nthe same as were used earlier (Eqs. 1 & 2) and are typical\nof normal stars (Bessell & Brett 1988; Allen 1976). The\nlimiting magnitude criterion is intended to avoid selecting objects significantly fainter than the detection limit of\nthe ISOCAM survey (F12\u03bcm \u223c 0.2 mJy is approximately\nequivalent to K \u223c 13 mag), but is faint enough to allow\nfor stars with some MIR excess to be included. The resulting catalogue contains 51 stars. We discuss possible\nselection effects at the end of this section, especially the\nimpact of stars with infrared excess.\nUsing all available magnitudes from ESS, 2MASS,\nDENIS and USNO for each of the 51 stars, we find the best\nfit template spectrum from the library of Lejeune et al.\n(1997), in the same fashion as in Sect. 3.3 for the 22 stars\ndetected by ISOCAM . We then use the optical-12 \u03bcm relations of WCA in Eqs. 5 and 6 to estimate the 12 \u03bcm\nflux density. Three of the 51 stars which have predicted\nF12 \u03bcm > 0.2 mJy have fits with 3 < \u03c72 < 10. For these 3\nstars, we use instead the relation:\nK \u2212 [12] = 0.03 \u00b1 0.1\n\n(8)\n\nderived from the 13 well fitted stars of Sect. 3.3. For all\nother stars, we find a well fit spectrum with low \u03c72 (< 3).\nOf the 51 stars, 18 (including the 3 stars with \u03c72 > 3)\nhave predicted 12 \u03bcm flux density above the detection\nlimit, but were not found by the MR source extraction\n\n9\n\nsoftware. This sample, including the 22 flux density calibrated, ISOCAM-detected stars is then used to determine the fraction of 2MASS stars detected by ISOCAM\nat 12 \u03bcm as a function of flux density. This result provides\nus with a first estimate of the completeness, presented in\nFig. 7 (red dotted line). The bins in Fig. 7 have equal sizes\nin log flux density space and the errors for each bin are\nassumed to be Poisson.\nWe now consider the possible selection effects. It is\nunlikely that we have missed stars due to the colour criteria (Eqs. 1 & 2) which are robust for normal stars, even\nthose with a MIR excess. It is also unlikely that we have\nincluded any galaxies as they would be poorly fitted by\nthe stellar templates. But it is possible that some of the\nselected stars have infrared excess and hence their true\n12 \u03bcm flux density is larger than that predicted. An excess of K \u2212 [12] \u223c 1 \u2212 4 would be equivalent to an increase\nof flux density equivalent to \u2206 log(F12 \u03bcm ) \u223c 0.4 \u2212 1.6.\nHence if our field contains stars with infrared excesses,\nthen the completeness estimated here represents an upper\nlimit. We note however that only 3 out of the 22 stars\ndetected by ISOCAM have 12 \u03bcm excesses. Therefore, we\nestimate that the completeness may be overestimated by\n15% at most, which is well inside the Poisson error bars.\nBecause the pixels are relatively large, 6\u2032\u2032 , most galaxies appear unresolved to ISOCAM. We can then assume\nthat the sensitivity of the detector is the same for unresolved objects, i.e. stars, as for resolved objects like galaxies. Hence the completeness in galaxies is likely similar to\nthat of stars and can be used as such. If the completeness for galaxies is however affected by the non-detection\nof low surface brightness objects, then again the estimate\nplotted in Fig. 7 is an upper limit. We also suspect that\nthis effect is smaller than the plotted Poisson errors.\n\n5.2. Completeness from low significance sources\nThe second method provides an independent correction\nto the source counts. It is based on the association of\nISOCAM sources detected at low significance with optically detected galaxies. A priori, some of the ISOCAM\nsources detected with a detection threshold located in the\ninterval 3\u03c4w to 5\u03c4w may be real. By examining their association with the ESS optical sources, we can evaluate their\nreality in a statistical way. We use PRETI as in Sect. 2,\nbut with a detection threshold in wavelet space of 3\u03c4w .\nThis threshold leads to detection of 328 sources, to be\ncompared with the 5\u03c4w list of 142 objects presented in\nTable 4. After correcting the flux density of each object\nby the correction found in section 3.4, and removing the\nsources with a flux density below the detection limit of\n0.24 mJy, we end up with 292 potential sources (i.e. the\n142 sources of the original catalogue and 150 new sources\nof lower significance).\nWe then cross-correlate the 150 new 3\u03c4w ISOCAM\nsources with the ESS catalogue. Using a 3\u2032\u2032 (6\u2032\u2032 ) search\nradius we find 74 (110) optical counterparts.

As some of these matches are by\nchance, due to the size of our search radius and the space\ndensity of optical sources, we evaluate the excess matches\nby offsetting the positions of the 2 data sets by increasing\nmultiples of half an arcsecond in RA and Dec. At large\n\u2032\u2032\noffsets (>\n\u223c 6 ), the number of matches becomes roughly\nconstant with a value around 20 (55) for the 3\u2032\u2032 (6\u2032\u2032 ) search\nradius. These numbers are comparable with the theoretical numbers of 17 (70) sources expected within the 3\u2032\u2032\n(6\u2032\u2032 ) search radius if one uses the sky density of objects\nand assumes a random distribution.\nWe now assume that adding the sources from either the 3\u2032\u2032 or 6\u2032\u2032 list to the high-significance list of 142\nsources, yields a nearly 'complete' source catalogue. This\nassumption is reasonable because there is a large excess\nof ISOCAM coincidences with the ESS above the theoretical and empirical random values. A 'real' object, detected with [12] < 13 (corresponding to the 12 \u03bcm detection limit), must have V < 22.5 if it is a star-forming\ngalaxy at z <\n\u223c 1. This selection is derived from typical, maximum Ks \u2212 [12] colours (\u223c 5, see Fig. 3) and\ntypical, maximum V \u2212 Ks colour (\u223c 4.5). The possibility that some sources are not real is taken into account\nin the errors on the source counts which are derived in\nRocca-Volmerange et al. (2007).\nThe resulting completeness, defined as the ratio of the\nuncorrected number counts from the 5\u03c4w list to the counts\nfrom the 'complete' list, is plotted as a function of flux\ndensity in Fig. 7 (solid line). The bins again have equal\nsizes in log flux density space, albeit smaller than before,\nand the errors are simply Poisson. Note that the curve\ncorresponding to a search radius of 3\u2032\u2032 is indistinguishable\nfrom that with 6\u2032\u2032 plotted in Fig. 7.\nThe sources counts extended to 3\u03c4w are subject to several biases: they probably include some sources which are\nfalse and might still miss some real sources which would\nbe above our 0.24 mJy detection threshold. The former\nwould lead to an over-estimation of the source counts (although we include it in our error), and the latter, to an\n\nB\n\nV\n\nRU\n\nR\n\n10.81\n23.24\n\n17.92\n13.10\n11.53\n13.19\n\n22.86\n16.99\n\n22.34\n16.42\n12.12\n10.79\n12.31\n\n17.46\n20.75\n19.49\n\n16.36\n19.57\n18.67\n\n20.42\n\n15.82\n18.92\n18.27\n18.98\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nH\n\nKs\n\nS12\n\n10.61\n\n09.88\n\n09.63\n\n09.55\n\n15.69\n11.58\n10.48\n11.54\n\n16.05\n10.69\n10.15\n10.79\n15.73\n17.29\n\n15.23\n10.16\n09.89\n10.28\n15.05\n16.20\n\n14.90\n10.00\n09.82\n10.16\n14.67\n15.29\n\n5.31 \u00b1 0.28\n4.95 \u00b1 0.30\n4.63 \u00b1 0.27\n3.73 \u00b1 0.21\n3.22 \u00b1 0.23\n3.18 \u00b1 0.52\n3.14 \u00b1 0.19\n2.31 \u00b1 0.15\n2.24 \u00b1 0.15\n2.08 \u00b1 0.15\n\n18.39\n17.95\n18.45\n\nunder-estimation. It is nevertheless significant that the\nsource counts from both the low-significance lists (with\n3\u2032\u2032 and 6\u2032\u2032 search radii) yield a consistent incompleteness\nwith that derived from stars in the previous section (see\nFig. 7). Although difficult to quantify, the agreement of\nthese 2 independent methods for estimating the completeness indicates that these 2 selection effects affecting the\nlow-significance sources cancel out to a certain extent.\nTherefore both the full and dotted lines on Figs. 7 show\nthat our ISOCAM catalogue is complete to \u223c 1mJy, with\na linearly decreasing completeness in log flux density down\nto the our flux density detection limit of 0.24mJy. A complete analysis of the ISOCAM-ESS galaxy number-counts\nalong with the fitting of theoretical models are presented\nin the companion paper (Rocca-Volmerange et al. 2007).\n\n6. Conclusions\nWe present the data reduction of ISOCAM observations\nperformed with the LW10 filter centered near 12 \u03bcm,\nmostly in the field of the optical ESO-Sculptor survey\n(Arnouts et al. 1997; de Lapparent et al. 2003). The data\nreduction of the ISOCAM rasters is performed as by\nAussel et al. (1999): we use the multi-scale vision model\nof Ru\u00e9 & Bijaoui (1996) implemented into the MR software (Starck et al. 1999), along with the PRETI algorithm aimed at removing all image artifacts above the\nnoise level. Using a detection threshold of 5\u03c4w where \u03c4w is\nthe noise level in wavelet space, we reach a detection limit\nof \u223c 0.24 mJy.\nThe final catalogue contains 142 ISOCAM sources\nwith optical counterparts in the ESO-Sculptor survey,\nwhich we complement by optical and NIR magnitudes\nfrom the USNO B catalogue, and the 2MASS and DENIS\nsurveys. Optical, near-infrared and mid-infrared colourcolour diagrams subsequently allow us to identify 22\nsources as stars and 120 as galaxies, which dominate at\nfaint flux densities. By template fitting of 13 of these stars,\nwe derive their predicted 12 \u03bcm flux density using the\ntemplate optical colours combined with the optical-mid-\n\n\fSeymour, Rocca-Volmerange and de Lapparent: 12\u03bcm ISOCAM of the ESS\n\nFig. 7.

(1987). By comparison with the observed ISOCAM flux densities normalized using the IRAS 12 \u03bcm zero-point, we measure that\nthe observed flux densities systematically overestimate the\ntheoretical flux densities by a factor of 1.16 (1/0.86). We\nuse this offset to correct all flux densities (i.e. stars and\ngalaxies). We use a similar method (predicting the 12 \u03bcm\nflux density of stars) to determine the completeness of our\nsurvey as a function of flux density. This completeness\nfunction is found to be in good agreement with that from\na statistical study of the coincidence of low significance\nISOCAM sources with the ESO-Sculptor optical sources.\nThe\nISOCAM-ESO-Sculptor-Survey\ncatalogue\nobtained here is used to analyse the mid-infrared\ngalaxy number counts in Rocca-Volmerange et al.\n(2007). By using the available ESO-Sculptor redshifts\n(de Lapparent et al. 2003), we will also derive the 12 \u03bcm\nluminosity function, which is a valuable tool for interpreting the deep mid-infrared source counts and performing\na detailed study of the evolution of galaxies at 12 \u03bcm,\na wavelength range unavailable to the MIPS and IRAC\ninstruments aboard it Spitzer (Gallagher et al. 2003).\nAcknowledgements.
