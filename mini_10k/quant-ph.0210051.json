[Phys. Rev. A 58 (1998) 883].\nPacs: 03.67.-a; 89.70.+c; 03.65.Bz\n\nKeywords: Quantum Entanglement; Unitary Operations; Quantum Information\nTheory\n\n1\n\n\fEntanglement is one of the most fundamental phenomena of quantum mechanics [1].\nIt is a physical resource, like energy, associated with the peculiar non-classical correlations\nthat are possible between separated quantum systems. One needs entanglement so as to implement quantum information processes [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] such as quantum cryptographic key\ndistribution [10], quantum teleportation [11], superdense coding [12], and quantum computation [13,14,15]. Production of entanglement is the elementary prerequisite for any quantum\ncomputation. This basic task is accomplished by unitary transformations \u00db (quantum gates)\nrepresenting quantum evolution acting on the space state of multipartite systems. \u00db should\ndescribe nontrivial interactions among the degrees of freedom of its subsystems.\nOne of the fundamental questions about quantum computation is then how to construct\nan adequate set of quantum gates, and a nice answer can be given: any generic two-qubits\ngate suffices for universal computation [16]. One would then be legitimately interested in\nascertaining just how efficient distinct \u00db's are as entanglers. In this respect, much exciting\nwork has recently been performed (see, for instance, [17,18,19,20,21,22,23]).\nA state of a composite quantum system is called \"entangled\" if it can not be represented\nas a mixture of factorizable pure states. Otherwise, the state is called separable. The\nabove definition is physically meaningful because entangled states (unlike separable states)\ncannot be prepared locally by acting on each subsystem individually [24,25]. A physically\nmotivated measure of entanglement is provided by the entanglement of formation E[\u03c1] [26].\nThis measure quantifies the resources needed to create a given entangled state \u03c1. That is,\nE[\u03c1] is equal to the asymptotic limit (for large n) of the quotient m/n, where m is the number\nof singlet states needed to create n copies of the state \u03c1 when the optimum procedure based\non local operations is employed. The entanglement of formation for two-qubits systems is\ngiven by Wootters' expression [27],\nE[\u03c1] = h\n\n1+\n\n\u221a\n\n!\n\n1 \u2212 C2\n,\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nh(x) = \u2212x log2 x \u2212 (1 \u2212 x) log2 (1 \u2212 x),\n2\n\n(2)\n\n\fand C stands for the concurrence of the two-qubits state \u03c1. The concurrence is given by\nC = max(0, \u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb3 \u2212 \u03bb4 ),\n\n(3)\n\n\u03bbi , (i = 1, . . . 4) being the square roots, in decreasing order, of the eigenvalues of the matrix\n\u03c1\u03c1\u0303, with\n\u03c1\u0303 = (\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y )\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y ).\n\n(4)\n\nThe above expression has to be evaluated by recourse to the matrix elements of \u03c1 computed\nwith respect to the product basis.\nIn the present effort we will concern ourselves with one particular quantum circuit: the\nHadamard-CNOT circuit, that combines two gates: a single-qubit one (Hadamard's) with\na two-qubits gate (CNOT). Quantum logic gates are unitary evolution operators \u00db that\nact on the states of a certain number of qubits. If the number of such qubits is m, the\nquantum gate is represented by a 2m x2m matrix in the unitary group U(2m ). These gates\nare reversible: one can reverse the action, thereby recovering an initial quantum state from\na final one. We shall work here with m = 2. The simplest nontrivial 2-qubits operation\nis the quantum controlled-NOT, or CNOT (equivalently, the exclusive OR, or XOR). Its\nclassical counterpart is a reversible logic gate operating on two bits: e1 , the control bit, and\ne2 , the target bit. If e1 = 1, the value of e2 is negated. Otherwise, it is left untouched.\nThe quantum CNOT gate C12 (the first subscript denotes the control bit, the second the\ntarget one) plays a paramount role in both experimental and theoretical efforts that revolve\naround the quantum computer concept. In a given orthonormal basis {|0i, |1i}, and if we\ndenote addition modulo 2 by the symbol \u2295, we have [28]\n|e1 i |e2 i \u2192 C12 \u2192 |e1 i |e1 \u2295 e2 i.\n\n(5)\n\nIn conjunction with simple single-qubit operations, the CNOT gate constitutes a set of gates\nout of which any quantum gate may be built [16]. In other words, single qubit and CNOT\ngates are universal for quantum computation [16].\n3\n\n\fAs stated, the CNOT gate operates on quantum states of two qubits and is represented\nby a 4x4-matrix. This matrix has a diagonal block form. The upper diagonal block is just\nthe unit 2x2 matrix. The lower diagonal 2x2 block is the representation of the one-qubit\nNOT gate UN OT , of the form\n0 1\n1 0\n\n(6)\n\n2\nNote that, of course, C12\n= 1. This gate is able to transform factorizable pure states into\n\nentangled ones, i.e.,\nC12 : [c1 |0i + c2 |1i]|0i \u2194 c1 |0i|0i + c2 |1i|1i,\n\n(7)\n\nand this transformation can be reversed by applying the same CNOT operation once more\n[28].\nThe Hadamard transform TH (TH2 = 1) is given by\n1\nTH = \u221a [\u03c31 + \u03c33 ],\n2\n\n(8)\n\nand acts on the single qubit basis {|0 >, |1 >} in the following fashion\n1\nTH |0 > = \u221a [|1 > \u2212|0 >]\n2\n1\nTH |1 > = \u221a [|0 > +|1 >].\n2\n\n(9)\n\nConsider now the two-qubits uncorrelated basis {|00 >, |01 >, |10 >, |11 >}. If we act with\nTH on the members of this basis we obtain\n1\n\u221a\n2\n1\n\u221a\n2\n1\n\u221a\n2\n1\n\u221a\n2\n\n[|1 > \u2212|0 > ]\n\n|0 >\n\n[|1 > \u2212|0 > ]\n\n|1 >\n\n[|0 > +|1 > ]\n\n|0 >\n\n[|0 > +|1 > ]\n\n|1 >,\n\nso that the posterior action of the CNOT gate yields\n4\n\n(10)\n\n\f1\n\u221a [|1 > |1 > \u2212|0 > |0 >]\n2\n1\n\u221a [|1 > |0 > \u2212|0 > |1 >]\n2\n1\n\u221a [|0 > |0 > +|1 > |1 >]\n2\n1\n\u221a [|0 > |1 > +|1 > |0 >],\n2\n\n(11)\n\ni.e., save for an irrelevant overall phase factor in two of the kets, the maximally correlated Bell\nbasis |\u03c6\u00b1 i, |\u03c8 \u00b1 i. We see then that the TH -CNOT combination transforms an uncorrelated\nbasis in the maximally correlated one.\nNow, the two-qubits systems with which we are going to be concerned here are the\nsimplest quantum mechanical systems exhibiting the entanglement phenomenon and play a\nfundamental role in quantum information theory. The concomitant space H of mixed states\nis 15-dimensional and its properties are not of a trivial character. While the entanglement\nof pure states can be regarded as well understood, the entanglement of mixed states still\nhas many properties that deserve further investigation. The reason for this state of affairs\nlies in the fact the quantum content of the associated correlations is somewhat obscured by\nthe classical correlations in a mixed state. A mixed state which does not violate any Bell\ninequality can nonetheless exhibit quantum mechanical correlations, as one can distill from\nit pure maximally entangled states that violate Bell inequalities [6].\nThere are still then H-features, related to the phenomenon of entanglement, that have not\nyet been characterized in full detail. One such characterization problem will occupy us here.\nWe shall perform a systematic numerical survey of the action of the TH -CNOT circuit on our\n15-dimensional space in order to ascertain the manner in which P (\u2206E) is distributed in H,\nwith P the probability of generating a change \u2206E associated to the action of this reversible\nquantum circuit. This kind of exploratory work is in line with recent efforts towards the\nsystematic exploration of the space of arbitrary (pure or mixed) states of composite quantum\nsystems [29,30,31] in order to determine the typical features exhibited by these states with\nregards to the phenomenon of quantum entanglement [29,30,31,32,33,34,35]. It is important\n5\n\n\fto stress the fact that we are exploring a space in which the majority of states are mixed.\nThe exciting investigations reported in [17,18,19,20,21] address mainly pure states. We will\ntry to answer the question: given an initial degree of entanglement of formation E, what\nis the probability P (\u2206E) of encountering a change in entanglement \u2206E upon the action of\nthis circuit?\nOur answer will arise from a Monte Carlo exploration of H. To do this we need to define\na proper measure on H. The space of all (pure and mixed) states \u03c1 of a quantum system\ndescribed by an N-dimensional Hilbert space can be regarded as a product space S = P \u00d7 \u2206\n[29,30]. Here P stands for the family of all complete sets of orthonormal projectors {P\u0302i }N\ni=1 ,\nP\n\ni\n\nP\u0302i = I (I being the identity matrix). \u2206 is the set of all real N-uples {\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbN }, with\n\n0 \u2264 \u03bbi \u2264 1, and\n\nP\n\ni\n\n\u03bbi = 1. The general state in S is of the form \u03c1 =\n\nP\n\ni\n\n\u03bbi Pi . The Haar\n\nmeasure on the group of unitary matrices U(N) induces a unique, uniform measure \u03bd on the\nset P [29,30,36]. On the other hand, since the simplex \u2206 is a subset of a (N \u22121)-dimensional\nhyperplane of RN , the standard normalized Lebesgue measure LN \u22121 on RN \u22121 provides a\nmeasure for \u2206. The aforementioned measures on P and \u2206 lead to a measure \u03bc on the set\nS of quantum states [29,30],\n\u03bc = \u03bd \u00d7 LN \u22121 .\n\n(12)\n\nWe are going to consider the set of states of a two-qubits system. Consequently, our\nsystem will have N = 4 and, for such an N, S \u2261 H. All our present considerations are\nbased on the assumption that the uniform distribution of states of a two-qubit system is the\none determined by the measure (12). Thus, in our numerical computations we are going to\nrandomly generate states of a two-qubits system according to the measure (12) and study the\nentanglement evolution of these states upon the action of our TH -CNOT quantum circuit.\nAs a first step, we suggest that the reader take a look at Fig. 4a of Ref. [34]. There\none finds a plot of the probability P (E) of finding two-qubits states of H endowed with a\ngiven amount of entanglement E. In this graphs, the solid line corresponds to all states\n(pure and mixed), while the dashed curve depicts pure state behaviour only. We clearly see\n6\n\n\fthat our probabilities are of a quite different character when they refer to of pure states\nthan when they correspond to mixed ones. Most mixed states have null entanglement, or a\nrather small amount of it (see the enlightening discussion in [29]). For pure states it is more\nlikely to encounter them endowed with an intermediate (between null and total) amount\nof entanglement. It is then important to ascertain how much entanglement the TH -CNOT\nquantum circuit is able to generate on our 15-dimensional two-qubits space.\nWe deal with pure states only in Fig. 1. Fig. 1a plots the probability P (\u2206E) of obtaining\nvia the TH -CNOT quantum circuit a final state with entanglement change \u2206E = EF \u2212 E0 .\nIn 1b we are concerned with the average value hEF i pertaining to final states that result\nfrom the gate-operation on initial ones of a given (fixed) entanglement E0 (solid line). The\nhorizontal line is plotted for the sake of reference. It corresponds to the average entanglement\nof two-qubits pure states, equal to 1/(3 ln 2). The diagonal line hEF i = E0 is also shown\n(dashed line). EF is a decreasing function of E0 although the quantum circuit considered\nincreases the mean final entanglement approximately up to 0.5 for states with E0 lying in\nthe interval [0, 0.5].\nThe same analysis, but involving now all states (pure and mixed), is summarized in Fig.\n2. The graph 2a is the counterpart of 1a, while 2b is that of 2a. The dashed line of 2b,\ngiven for the sake of visual reference, if just the line hEF i = E0 . The two Figs. allow one\nto appreciate the fact that it is quite unlikely that we may generate, via the TH -CNOT\nquantum circuit, a significant amount of entanglement if the initial state is separable. In\nFig 2 we see that the mean final entanglement hEF i rises rapidly near the origin, from zero,\nwith E0 . The rate of entanglement-growth decreases steadily with E0 and the interval in\nwhich hEF i is greater than E0 is significantly smaller that the one corresponding to pure\nstates (Fig. 1b).\nThe P (\u2206E) vs. \u2206E plots exhibit a nitid peak at \u2206E = 0. The peak is enormously\nexaggerated if mixed states enter the picture (2a). Thus, if the initial state has null entanglement, our survey indicates that the most probable circumstance is that the circuit will\nleave its entanglement unchanged.\n7\n\n\fWe performed a systematic survey, in the space of all two-qubits states, concerning the\nentanglement changes associated with the action of the TH -CNOT circuit. We found that\nthe probability distribution of entanglement changes obtained when the circuit acts on pure\nstates is quite different from the distribution obtained when the circuit acts on general mixed\nstates. The probability of entangling mixed states turns out to be rather small. On average,\nthe TH -CNOT transformation is more efficient, as entangler, when acting upon states with\nsmall initial entanglement, specially in the case of pure states.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was partially supported by the DGES grant PB98-0124 (Spain), and by CONICET (Argentine Agency).\n\n8\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] Lo, H.-K., Popescu, S., Spiller, T.
