A typical example is\ntheir integration as important components of chemical\nand biological sensors.1 A micromixer is a microfluidic\ndevice used for effective mixing of different fluid constituents. It can be used to efficiently mix for example a variety of bio-reactants such as bacteria cells, large\nDNA molecules, enzymes and proteins in portable integrated microsystems with minimum energy consumption. It is also used in mixing of solutions in chemical\nreactions,2 sequencing of nucleic acids or drug solution\ndilution. Hence, the design of practical and efficient micromixers is a major research topic in microfluidics,3,4\nespecially in the development of micro total analysis systems. Over the years various methods of efficient mixing\nhave been developed and many of those have been successfully applied in industry.5\nThe small length scales of the micromixers has a negative impact on mixing as it results in laminar flows inside\nthe channels. In this flow regime, mixing is influenced\nmainly by the process of molecular inter-diffusion.6 Experiments with channels with complex surface topology\nincluding grooved walls have revealed that microscale\nmixing is enhanced by \"chaotic advection\", a process\nwhich was first reviewed by Aref in 1984.7 He describes\nhow mixing is still possible even at low Reynolds number\nby repeated stretching and folding of fluid elements.8 If\nproperly applied, this mechanism causes the interfacial\narea between the fluids to increase exponentially, which\ncan then lead to an enhanced intermaterial transport,\nhence mixing. A comprehensive mathematical descrip-\n\ntion of the exponential growth of interfacial surfaces can\nbe found in the book by Ottino.9 Mixers were designed in\nthe following years, which utilize the principle of \"chaotic\nadvection\".10 However, it is important to note that the\nterm \"chaotic\" is used strictly in a Lagrangian sense.11\nDepending on the working principle, micromixers can\nbe categorized into two important types: if energy from\nan external source is used to drive the mixing process,\nthen it is termed as \"active mixer\". These external energy sources can be acoustic bubble induced vibrations,\nperiodic variation of the flow rate, piezoelectric vibrating\nmembranes, valves, etc. The external sources are often\nmoving components such as micropumps and they require advanced fabrication steps.12 The second category\nof micromixers is based on restructuring the flow profile\nusing static but sophisticated mixer geometries. These\nare termed as \"passive mixer\". Passive micromixers have\nthe advantage of simple fabrication, easy operation and\nno elements which can generate heat. The absence of\nheating is an important factor for applications to biological studies where temperature is a sensitive parameter.\nThe mixing length and mixing time are defined as the distance and time span the fluid constituents have to flow inside the mixer in order to obtain a homogeneous mixture.\nAn effective micromixer should reduce the mixing length\nand mixing time substantially in order to achieve rapid\nmixing. A common practice to design passive micromixers is to create alternating thin fluid lamellae. These\nresult in an interfacial area that increases with the number of lamellae rendering the diffusion process more effective and hence allowing fast mixing.13 There are many\nexamples of bi-lamellation14,15 and multi-lamellation5 in\nthe literature on micromixers. However, the drawback\n\n\f2\nof such devices is that the number of lamellae is generally limited due to the negative impact on the applied\npressure drop caused by the required microstructures inside the channel. Other examples of passive micromixers include the twisted pipe mixer,16 the superfocus micromixer, where several jets are made to collide at the\nfocal point of the jets and the three dimensional serpentine model.5\nThe recently developed so-called \"chaotic micromixer\"\nhas gained substantial interest in the literature since it\novercomes some of the drawbacks of conventional mixers based on muti-lamellation. Such a device consists\nof microstructured objects such as \"herringbones\" (see\nFig. 1). The staggered herringbone mixer (SHM) was\nintroduced as one of the first experimental implementations of chaotic micromixers in 2002 by Stroock et al.17\nThe half cycles of the SHM consist of grooves with two\narms which are asymmetric and unequal in length. These\narms are inclined at an angle of 45\u25e6 to the wall and 90\u25e6\nagainst each other, while the pattern interchanges every\nhalf cycle of the herringbone. The peculiar arrangement\nof the herringbone structure enhances the mixing process\nby \"chaotic advection\" where the interfacial area between\nthe fluids grows exponentially in time \u2013 another important advantage over mixers using the concept of multilamellation. The SHM was used by several authors for\nstudies related to mixing and analysis of mixing quality.\nTo characterize the mixing quality of the SHM, Aubin et\nal.18 implemented particle tracking techniques using the\nvariance of tracer dispersion. Li and Chen report on an\noptimization of the SHM using the standard deviation\nof particle concentrations. As in the current paper, they\nused the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method to model the\nflow field.19 Further, the SHM was used by Kirtland et\nal.20 to study the mass transfer to reactive boundaries\nfrom three-dimensional micro-channels.\nFor the development of micromixers it is important to\nhave reliable tools at hand to quantify their performance.\nEfficiency and mixing quality have been studied by various methods in the past. These include the analysis\nof the probability density function of the flow profiles,\nstudying the stretching of the flow field, the Poincar\u00e9\nsection analysis, or the intensity of segregation as introduced by Danckwerts in 1952.21 In this paper an alternative numerical procedure is presented which is tailored\nfor the optimization of chaotic micromixers. It is based\non LB simulations to describe the flow inside complex\nmixer geometries together with a measurement of finite\ntime Lyapunov exponents (FTLE) as obtained from trajectories of massless tracer particles immersed in the flow.\nThe LB method can easily handle flows in complex geometries, which makes this method convenient for flows\nin advanced microstructures such as the micromixers the\ncurrent paper focuses on. The Lyapunov exponent provides a quantitative measure of long term average growth\nrates of small initial flow perturbations and thus allows a\nquantification of the efficiency of chaotic advection.22,23\nSince the systems of interest are finite and simulations are\n\nlimited to a finite time span, the proposed method utilizes Wolf's method to calculate the FTLE.13 While LB\nsimulations of flows in micromixers and FTLE computations to quantify the degree of chaotic advection have\nbeen reported in the literature before, their combination\nfor 3D performance quantification of realistic chaotic micromixers has to our knowledge not been published before. The numerical scheme has the potential to assist\nan experimental optimization since geometrical parameters or fluid properties can easily be changed without\nrequiring a new experiment. To demonstrate its applicability, the scheme is applied to evaluate the parameters\nof the staggered herringbone mixer that lead to improved\nperformance.\nIn the following sections the lattice Boltzmann method\nwhich is applied to simulate the fluid flow and the Wolf's\nalgorithm from which the finite time Lyapunov exponents\nare obtained are described. Finally, the numerical results\nand conclusions are given.\n\nII.\n\nSIMULATION METHOD\n\nThe lattice Boltzmann method is used to describe the\nfluid flow. The LB method is a simplified approach to\nsolve the Boltzmann equation in discrete space, time and\nwith a limited set of discrete velocities.24 The Boltzmann\nequation, given as\n\u2202t f + ~c * \u2207f = \u03a9(f ),\n\n(1)\n\nrepresents the evolution of the velocity distribution function by molecular transport and binary intermolecular\ncollisions. f (~r, ~c, t) represents the distribution of velocities in continuous position and velocity space, ~r and\n~c respectively. In the LB approach the position ~x at\nwhich f (~x, ~ck , t) is defined, is restricted to a discrete set\nof points on a regular lattice with lattice constant \u2206x,\nimplying that space is discretized. The velocity is restricted to a set of velocities ~ck implying that velocity is\ndiscretized along specific directions. \u2206t denotes the discrete time step. The model we adopt is a D3Q19 model\nwhich is a 3 dimensional model with 19 different velocity\ndirections, k = 0, 1, ..., 18.25 The right hand side of the\nabove equation represents the collision operator which is\nsimplified to the linear Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK)\nform.26 In a discretized form the BGK operator is written as\n\u03a9k = \u03c9(fkeq (~x, t) \u2212 fk (~x, t)).\n\n(2)\n\nHere, \u03c9 is the reciprocal of the relaxation time of the\nsystem controlling the relaxation towards the MaxwellBoltzmann equilibrium distribution fkeq (~x, t). By considering small velocities and constant temperature, a discretized third order Taylor expansion of the above equi-\n\n\f3\n\nH\n\nw\n\nh\nx CO\n\u0003\u000f\n\n@@\n@@ d\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n\nW\n\nC z\u0003y\nD\n\nFIG. 1.\nA typical example of a SHM geometry as it is used for the simulations. The dimensions of this channel are\n32\u00d764\u00d7D/\u2206x lattice units, where D depends on the distance between the grooves d and the number of grooves per half cycle\nn. H is the height of the channel and w is the horizontal length of the long arm. We define the height fraction as \u03b1 = h/H,\nwidth fraction as \u03b2 = w/W , and the distance fraction as \u03b3 = d/D. The wall at x = 32 is not shown in the figure, in order to\nview the inside of the channel.\n\nlibrium distribution function can be written as\n(~ck * ~u eq )2 ~u eq * ~u eq\n\u03c1\n~ck * ~u eq\n+\n\u2212\n1+\n2\n\u03c1\u25e6\ncs\n2cs 4\n2cs 2\n!\n(~ck * ~u eq )3\n(~ck * ~u eq )(~u eq * ~u eq )\n+\n\u2212\n,\n6cs 6\n2cs 4\n(3)\n\nfkeq (~x, t) =\u03b6k\n\nwhere fkeq denotes the equilibrium distribution function\ncorresponding to the velocity vector ~ck , \u03b6k are the lattice weights,\n\u221a \u03c1 is the density, \u03c1\u25e6 a reference density, and\ncs = (1/ 3)\u2206x/\u2206t is the speed of sound. ~u eq is the\nequilibrium velocity of the fluid, which is shifted from\nthe mean velocity by an amount ~g /\u03c9 under the influence\nof a constant acceleration ~g . The evolution of the LB\nprocess takes place in two steps: the collision step where\nthe velocities are redistributed along the directions of the\nlattice and the propagation step by which they are displaced along these directions. These discrete LB steps\nare implemented by the equation\nfk (~x+\u2206t~ck , t+\u2206t)\u2212fk (~x, t) = \u2212\u03c9\u2206t(fkeq (~x, t)\u2212fk (~x, t)),\n(4)\nwhich gives the dynamic evolution of the distribution\nfunction and is referred to as a discretized Boltzmann\nkinetic equation. The macroscopic fluid density is given\nby\nX\n\u03c1(~x, t) = \u03c1\u25e6\nfk (~x, t)\n(5)\nk\n\nand the macroscopic fluid velocity in the presence of external forcing is given by27\n\u03c1\u25e6 X\n\u2206t\n~u(~x, t) =\nfk (~x, t)~ck \u2212\n~g .\n(6)\n\u03c1(~x, t)\n2\nk\n\nIt can be shown by a Chapman-Enskog expansion that\nthe macroscopic fields ~u and \u03c1 from the above equations\n\nfulfill the Navier Stokes equation in the low Mach number\nlimit and for isothermal systems.24 In order to simulate\na fluid flow through microchannels, periodic boundary\nconditions are implemented along the z direction (see\nFig. 1) and no-slip bounce back boundary conditions are\nimposed at the channel walls. The experimental setup\nof Stroock et al. consists of a number of repeated cycles (\u223c15) consisting of two asymmetric half cycles each.\nBy simulating one full cycle only and applying periodic\nboundary conditions we can reduce the required computational effort substantially. If the system is in steady\nstate, we do not expect any substantial differences in the\nflow field in different cycles. Therefore, this approach is\nvalid. If, however, the experimental system would not be\nperiodic, such a simplification would not be allowed and\nthe full geometry would have to be simulated.\nWe simulate a fluid which is hydrodynamically similar to water, flowing inside a SHM with a cross section of 96 \u03bcm \u00d7 192 \u03bcm. The length of the channel is\n1536\u03bcm, but can be varied in order to always accommodate a full cycle of the herringbone structure. For\ncomputational efficiency we have chosen a lattice resolution of \u2206x = 3 \u03bcm resulting in a fixed cross section of 32\u2206x \u00d7 64\u2206x and system lengths of the order\nof 512\u2206x. Such a relatively low resolution is sufficient to\nproperly resolve the flow field as can be observed from\nFig. 2, where the velocity field perpendicular to the flow\nis shown at positions within different half cycles (a,b).\nFig. 2c) shows the profile in flow direction. While the\nfirst two subfigures nicely demonstrate the swirling motion of the flow, the third one depicts how the flow penetrates between the grooves and stays mostly unaffected\nclose to the upper boundary of the channel. Previously,\nwe have shown that a well resolved velocity field with less\nthan 4 percent error as compared to the analytical solution can be obtained even for a resolution of 6-8 lattice\nnodes in the case of a 3D rectangular Poiseuille flow.27\n\n\f4\nWe further demonstrated that flow over random rough\nsurfaces can be well resolved even if the smallest obstacles are only described by 2-4 lattice units.33,34 In the LB\nmethod, the kinematic viscosity is related to the discrete\ntime step through the expression \u03bd = cs 2 (1/\u03c9 \u2212 \u2206t/2).\nSince \u03c9\u2206t is chosen to be 1 to minimize artefacts due\nto the mid-grid bounce back boundary conditions and\nthe simulated fluid has the kinematic viscosity of water,\n\u03bd = 10\u22126 m2 s\u22121 , this implies for the current choice of\n\u2206x that \u2206t = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 s and cs = 1.15 m s\u22121 . When\nthe magnitude of ~g is 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 m s\u22122 along the z direction, the average steady state velocity of the system\nis u \u2248 6.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 m s\u22121 which corresponds to a subsonic\nflow. The Reynolds\n\u221a number Re = u L/\u03bd of the flow is\n\u2248 1.3, where L = H 2 + W 2 is the characteristic length\nof the channel. One set of simulations is obtained for ~g\nbeing 0.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 m s\u22122 which corresponds to Re \u2248 0.4.\nWhen the flow simulation has reached its steady state,\nP = 1000 massless and non-interacting tracer particles\nare introduced at fluid nodes in the z = 0 plane and\nthen their velocities are integrated at each time step. To\ncalculate the FTLE from particle trajectories a group of\nfive particles forms four pairs, with every 5th particle\nplaced at the center and the remaining ones being placed\nat the four nearest off-diagonal neighboring LB lattice\nsites. The particle at the center traces a fiducial orbit.\nWith this arrangement we are able to follow 800 particle\npairs by using only 1000 particles.\nThe trajectories are obtained by integrating the vector\nequation of motion\n~j\ndR\n~ j ),\n= ~u(R\ndt\n\nj = 1, ..., P\n\n(7)\n\n~ j denotes the position vector of an individual\nwhere R\n~ j ) is obtained from the\ntracer particle. The velocity ~u(R\ndiscrete LB velocity field through a trilinear interpolation\nscheme.\n\"Chaotic\" systems in general have the important feature that two nearby trajectories diverge exponentially\nin time. The rate at which these trajectories diverge can\nbe related to the ability of the flow field to create conditions for chaotic mixing. The Lyapunov exponent is a\npossible measure of the performance of a micromixer as\nit is related to the rate of stretching of the fluid elements.\nIt is defined by\n\u03bb\u221e = lim\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n1 D(t)\nln\n,\nt D(0)\n\n(8)\n\nwhere D(t) is the distance between two trajectories at\ntime t which evolve from an initial separation D(0). \u03bb\u221e\ngives the value of the Lyapunov exponent as t tends to\ninfinity. Due to the finite size of any microfluidic system\nit is not possible to implement this definition in a simulation code to study the performance of a micromixer\nAlso, when two trajectories separate from each other,\nthis definition does not allow to understand the ongoing\n\nstretching and folding dynamics of the flow. A quantitative measure of the mixer performance based on the\nLyapunov exponent can be obtained by using the FTLE\ninstead of the previous expression.28,29 The FTLE takes\nthe dynamical process more completely into account and\nprovides a numerically implementable scheme for quantification of the performance of mixers. The FTLE is\ndefined as30\n\u03bbFTLE =\n\n1\nD(t + \u03b4t)\nln\n,\n\u03b4t\nD(t)\n\n(9)\n\nwhere t is any particular instant of time and \u03b4t is a finite\ntime after which the FTLE is measured. The same process is repeated over N times, where N is a large number\ndenoting the number of times the FTLE is evaluated from\ntrajectories of particle pairs. Amon et al. named the\nFTLE as finite time Lagrangian Lyapunov exponent.11\nThe convergence of the average FTLE to the Lyapunov\nexponent for large N is discussed in the paper by Tang\nand Boozer,29\nlim h\u03bbFTLE iN = \u03bb\u221e .\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\n(10)\n\nWolf et al. suggested a method to calculate the FTLE\nfrom a set of experimental data which is well applicable\nto our simulations.13,31 The key idea of the method is\nto monitor the distance between particles forming a pair\nand to renormalize it by moving back one of the two particles towards the other one in case they have separated\nmore than a given threshold distance. The FTLE is then\ncomputed from the sum of individual Lyapunov exponents measured between replacements. The method has\nbeen verified on systems with known Lyapunov spectra\nand exact results have been achieved. Following Wolf's\napproach, we implement the following equation to quantify the mixer performance on the basis of the average\nFTLE as\nh\u03bbiN\n\nN \u22121\n1 X 1\nD(ti + \u03c4i )\n=\n,\nln\nN i=0 \u03c4i\nD(ti )\n\n(11)\n\nwhere ti is the ith time when a FTLE is evaluated,\nD(ti + \u03c4i ) and D(ti ) are the distance between particle\npairs at time step ti + \u03c4i and ti , respectively. \u03c4i is the\nnumber of time steps which a pair of particles take until\nthe next replacement and its magnitude could be different for each measure. N is the total number of replacements made until time t when h\u03bbiN is evaluated. If h\u03bbiN\nhas a positive and non-zero value the particles separate\nfrom each other at an exponential rate. These particle\npairs are initially very close to each other and evolve in\ntime. If the separation between the pair is greater than\na maximum distance, the distance between the particles\nis re-adjusted to the initial distance D(t0 ). For the implementation of the scheme, for every particle pair one\nof the trajectories is chosen as the fiducial path, while\nthe position of the other particle is replaced if the distance becomes larger than the threshold value.

The velocity field perpendicular to the flow direction at z = 30 and z = 460 is shown in insets a) and b). The figures\ndepict the circulating motion of the flow which is triggered by the asymmetry of the herringbone shaped surface structures.\nInset c) shows the velocity field in flow direction at y = 21. Due to the choice of \u03b2 = 0.66 this value corresponds to a position\nclose to the tips of the herringbones in case of the first half cycle and to a case in the center of the long arm in the case of the\nsecond half cycle. As can be observed the velocity vectors point strongly downwards within the first half of the channel, but\nmostly upwards in the second half.\n\nschematically represented in Fig. 3. The choice of the\nmaximum distance is based on a variation of it together\nwith a comparison of the obtained FTLE: if it is chosen\ntoo large, many tracer particles hit the channel walls and\ndo not separate any further resulting in a too low value\nof the FTLE. If it is chosen too small, the tracers do not\nhave a sufficient amount of time to separate sufficiently\nso that an exponential increase of the distance cannot be\ndetected. The chosen value H/2 has been found to be a\ngood compromise between the two extreme cases. In order to avoid errors due to orientation one of the particles\nof a pair is placed along the line of separation. In case\na replacement point cannot be found due to a wall node\npresent at the location, a nearby fluid node is selected\nas the replacement point. If even such points cannot be\nfound since all surrounding nodes are surface nodes, the\nreplacement is postponed until a suitable replacement is\npossible.\nThe following section presents how FTLE can be utilized for an optimization strategy for chaotic micromixers. As an example, the influence of different parameters\nwhich directly affect the performance of the SHM is evaluated.

Fig. 1 provides a pictorial representation of\nthese parameters.\n\n\f6\n\n0.44\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe performance of the SHM is studied by varying four\ngeometrical parameters. While keeping all other parameters fixed (\u03b3 =0.089, \u03b1 =0.2, n=10), the width fraction\n(\u03b2 = w/W ) is varied within the range of 0.5 and 0.82\nand the distance fraction (\u03b3 = d/D) from 0.04 to 0.11.\nThen, the number of grooves per half cycle (n) is varied\nfrom 2 to 10 and the height fraction (\u03b1 = h/H) from\n0.125 to 0.343. The optimization of the SHM as presented here is meant to demonstrate the feasibility of the\nalgorithm only since several optimization studies of the\nSHM are already available in the literature. Therefore\nour optimization is reduced to a limited variation of the\nfour dimensional parameter space. This surely leads to\na local optimum of the geometrical parameters, but it\nis not assured that the global optimum has been found.\nHowever, as shown below, our parameters corespond to\nthe optimal ones found by other groups suggesting that\nour local optimum coincides with the global optimum.\nFig. 4 depicts simulated h\u03bbiN (t) for different width\nfractions \u03b2 = 0.66, 0.71, and 0.82. The Reynolds number is kept fixed at Re = 1.3 and h\u03bbiN (t) is obtained\nfrom tracing the trajectories of 1000 particles. From\nFig. 4 it can be observed that in each case h\u03bbiN fluctuates before finally converging to a particular value after\n\u223c 6.0 \u00d7 105 time steps. All further simulations are run\nuntil the FTLE have thoroughly converged. The effect of\nthe geometry can be measured by comparing the average\nof the converged FTLE which is denoted by \u03bb. The error\nbars in Figs. 5 to 8 are given by the standard deviation\nof the data from the point where it has converged.\n\n1.0\n0.9\n\n\u03b2 = 0.66\n\u03b2 = 0.71\n\u03b2 = 0.82\n\n0.8\nh\u03bbiN\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.0\n\n0.42\n0.40\n\u03bb\n\nIII.\n\n0.38\n0.36\n\nRe = 0.4\nRe = 1.3\n\n0.34\n0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85\nwidth fraction \u03b2\nFIG. 5. The variation of the maximum averaged finite time\nLyapunov exponent \u03bb with different width fraction \u03b2, for two\ndifferent Reynolds numbers. The data indicates that the maximum \u03bb can be obtained for a width fraction of \u03b2 = 2/3. Error\nbars are given by the standard deviation of the mean value of\nh\u03bbiN .\n\nwe are interested in the dependence of the individual parameters on the performance of the SHM. Fig. 5 shows\nthe variance of \u03bb and as such the performance of the\nSHM with respect to the parameter \u03b2 for two different\nReynolds numbers, Re = 0.4 and 1.3. Larger values are\ndifficult to obtain due to the limits of the LB method or\nwould include a substantial increase in computing time.\nDue to the symmetry of the mixer geometry, only values\nfor \u03b2 \u2265 0.5 are shown. The datasets peak at \u03b2 = 2/3,\nwhich implies that the degree of chaotic advection is maximized for this particular value of the width fraction \u03b2.\nAccording to the units chosen above this corresponds to\nw = 130 \u03bcm. The curves for the different Reynolds numbers depict that changing the driving force of the fluid\ndoes influence the absolute value of \u03bb, but has no influence on the general shape of the curve. Similar studies\nof the Re dependence for other geometrical parameters\nand various different driving forces confirm this behavior.\nOur findings are consistent with the original experimental work of Stroock et al.17 as well as 2D numerical optimizations by Stroock and McGraw.32 The\n\u221a latter study\nh(C\u2212hCi)2 i\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nnumber of time steps t [10 ]\n6\n\nFIG. 4.\nThe average FTLE for 1,000 particles is shown\nversus the time steps for Re = 1.3. After 6.0 \u00d7 105 time steps,\nh\u03bbiN is converged and the average of this converged value is\ndenoted by \u03bb. The value of \u03bb depends on the width fraction\n\u03b2 as it is further investigated below.\n\nWhen one of the parameters is varied it is taken care\nthat the other parameters remain unchanged, because\n\nhow the so-called heterogeneity factor I =\nof\nhCi\na dye concentration C varies with the number of cycles in\nthe mixer. In both publications it is found that \u03b2 = 2/3\ngenerates a maximum swirling motion of the fluid.\nFor the next set of simulations \u03b2 is fixed at the optimized value of 2/3 and the distance fraction \u03b3 is varied\nfrom 0.04 to 0.11. Since it is observed from the previous results that the optimal value is independent of\nthe Reynolds number, the following simulations are performed at a constant Re = 1.3. The average value of\nconverged FTLE for different distance fractions is shown\nin Fig. 6. It can be observed that after a moderate in-\n\n\f7\ncrease of \u03bb with \u03b3, the curve has a sharp peak at \u03b3 = 0.07,\nwhich corresponds to a value of d = 105 \u03bcm for the current choice of \u2206x. Afterwards, \u03bb decreases in a similar\nfashion as for small \u03b3, but still at higher absolute values.\nA possible explanation is as follows: when the grooves\nare very close to each other, they create \"dead spaces\",\ni.e. regions in the micro-channel where the fluid gets\ntrapped and cannot move freely. With increasing the\ndistance between the grooves, the transverse component\nof the velocity increases, hence \"chaotic advection\" is enhanced resulting a large value for \u03bb. On the other hand,\nif the distance between grooves is too large, the mixer\nbehaves like a plain channel without any chaotic advection component. The maximum in Fig. 6 is then given\nby the optimal interplay of these two effects.\n\n0.50\n0.45\n\n0.44\n\n0.40\n\n0.42\n\n0.35\n\n\u03bb\n\n0.46\n\n0.40\n\u03bb\n\nrotations and come back to its original position before\nentering the next half cycle. An optimized value for n\ntherefore depends on the ratio of optimum rotation to\nthe frequency at which the distortions at the end of a half\ncycle occur. Similar to the work presented in the current\npaper, Li and Chen performed LB simulations and used\ntracers to follow the flow field.19 They, however, quantify\nmixing by computing the standard deviation of the local\ntracer concentration and conclude that SHM with n = 5\nor n = 6 perform best. Even though this result is in\nagreement with our finding, the FTLE analysis clearly\nshows that the channel with n = 5 performs better than\nthe one with n = 6.\n\n0.30\n\n0.38\n\n0.25\n\n0.36\n\n0.20\n\n0.34\n0.32\n0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11\ndistance fraction \u03b3\nFIG. 6. The variation of \u03bb versus the distance fraction \u03b3 for\nRe = 1.3 and \u03b2 = 2/3. The FTLE rises with the increase of\n\u03b3 until it reaches a distinct peak. After that the data shows\na decrease, indicating that the optimized performance of the\nmicromixer is at a groove distance \u03b3 = 0.07. The error bars\nare given by the standard deviation from the mean.\n\nAfter having optimized the values for \u03b2 and \u03b3, the\nnumber of grooves per half-cycle n is varied from 2 to\n10. It can be understood from Fig. 7 that a variation\nof n has the largest impact on the performance of the\nmixer as compared to \u03b2 or \u03b3. For the current setup, by\nvariation of n it is possible to change the value of \u03bb by\na factor of 2.3 as compared to 1.2 for \u03b2 and 1.3 for \u03b3.\nFig. 7 clearly shows that a staggered herringbone mixer\nwith n = 5 performs best. The existence of a maximum\nperformance in dependence on the number of grooves can\nbe explained by the fact that interplay between advection\nin flow direction and the swirling motion needs to be\noptimized for a well performing mixer. If the number\nof grooves is too small, the flow field is not sufficiently\nrotated when flowing through a half cycle. The change of\ndirection of the swirling motion at the beginning of the\nfollowing half cycle does not result in a relevant distortion\nof the trajectories then. If the number of grooves is too\nlarge, however, the fluid might perform one or more full\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9 10 11\n\nnumber of grooves per half cycle n\nFIG. 7. The variation of \u03bb with the number of grooves per\nhalf cycle (n) is shown. It can be observed that the SHM\nwith n = 5 performs best. Error bars indicate the standard\ndeviation from the mean values.\n\nThe final parameter to be varied is the ratio of the half\ndepth of the grooves to the height of the channel \u03b1. Fig. 8\nshows the average value of the converged Lyapunov exponents for different \u03b1 between 0.125 and 0.343. After\na strong increase of \u03bb(\u03b1), the data shows a maximum at\n\u03b1 = 0.25. For the units chosen above this corresponds\nto a groove depth of 24 \u03bcm. For larger \u03b1 the value of\n\u03bb decreases again. Our result is similar to the original\nexperimental analysis of Stroock et al.17 Again, an argument can be found for the existence of an optimal value\nfor the ratio between groove depth and system height: if\nthe grooves are too shallow, they are not able to generate\nthe swirling motion required for chaotic advection. On\nthe contrary, if the grooves are too deep the flow is not\nable to fully penetrate the grooves. Further, the volume\nbetween grooves and top surface becomes so small that\nthe swirling motion cannot develop anymore.\nIn this section we have demonstrated that a numerical\nscheme based on the LB method for the flow in complex mixer geometries together with Wolf's method to\ncalculate FTLE from trajectories of passive tracers are\na powerful tool for the quantification of chaotic mixing.\nWithout loosing generality, a limited optimization study\n\n\f8\ntion of other chaotic micromixer geometries and the introduction of multiple fluids to the problem.

This can be obtained\nby passive chaotic micromixers utilizing repeated stretching and folding of the fluid interfaces. The performance\nof such mixers depends on the rate at which \"chaotic advection\" of the fluid takes place. For the development of\nefficient chaotic micromixers it is mandatory to understand the underlying transport processes as well as their\ndependence on the geometric structure of the microfluidic\ndevice. In this paper we have demonstrated an efficient\nnumerical scheme which allows the quantification of the\nperformance of a micromixer. The scheme is based on\na LB solver to describe the time dependent flow field in\ncomplex mixer geometries combined with Wolf's method\nto compute FTLE from passive tracer trajectories. We\nhave demonstrated the applicability of the quantification\nmethod by applying it to find an optimal geometrical\nconfiguration of the SHM, but the scheme should be generally applicable to any chaotic mixer. By performing a\nsystematic variation of the relevant geometrical parameters we obtained a set of optimal values which is consistent with literature data published by others. However,\nthose data was obtained from experiments or numerical\nsimulations not taking the chaotic nature of the tracer\ntrajectories into account. The method presented here,\nhowever allows a quantification and optimization of the\nmixing performance by investigation of the underlying\nflow profiles.
