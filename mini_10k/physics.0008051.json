Special attention is paid to the interpretation of the hfs measurements in terms of variations\nof the fundamental constants.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere is no physical reason to expect that the \"fundamental constants\" are really constant quantities. Indeed,\ntheir variations have to have a cosmological scale. Since the publishing of a famous Dirac paper [1] a number\nof different hypotheses on their possible variations have been suggested as well as a number of trial to search\nfor these. A review of old models and searches could be found e. g. in Ref. [2]. We live in an expanding\nuniverse and an accepted contemporary picture of the history of our universe assumes that there were a few\nphase transitions with spontaneous breaking of some symmetries during the early stages of evolution (inflation\nmodel) [3].\nWe consider here only atomic and nuclear properties and the variations of the fundamental constants that\ncan be determined from changes in such properties. We do not discuss variation of the gravitational constant (a\nreview on that can be found in Refs. [2, 4]). There are two reasons for that. First of all, in looking for variations\nof nuclear and atomic properties (magnetic moments, masses, decay rates) it is not possible to consider strong,\nweak and electromagnetic effects independently. Next, from a theoretical point of view, we have to expect that\nthe variations of strong, weak and electromagnetic coupling constants are strongly correlated. In contrast to\nthat, any investigation for possible variations of the gravitational interaction can be done separately.\n\n1.1\n\nVariation of the constants and atomic spectroscopy\n\nAny search for a possible variation of the fundamental constants can be actually performed measuring some\natomic, molecular and nuclear properties and it is necessary to discuss relations between them. There are three\nvery different kinds of atomic and molecular transitions, available for precision spectroscopy:\n\u2217 E-mail:\n\u2020 The\n\nsek@mpq.mpg.de; ksg@hm.csa.ru\nsummer address\n\n1\n\n\f\u2022 Gross structure is associated with transitions between levels with different values of the principal number\nn. They have a scaling behaviour as \u03b12 me c2 /h or Ry. It has to be remembered that for any atom with\ntwo or more electrons, one has to introduce an effective quantum number n\u2217 , which is a function of the\norbital momentum (l). The nonrelativistic behaviour \u03b12 me c2 /h is actually associated with n\u2217 (l) and,\nhence, in non-hydrogen-like atoms, transitions between levels with different value of l are also a part of\nthe gross structure.\n\u2022 Atomic fine structure, or separations of levels with the same n\u2217 (l) and different spin-orbit coupling (e. g.\ndifferent j or different sum of spin of valence electrons), has a scaling behaviour \u03b14 m c2 /h or \u03b12 Ry. That\nis part of relativistic corrections, which have the same order of magnitude.\n\u2022 Atomic hyperfine structure is a splitting due to a magnetic moment of the nucleus (\u03bc) and it is proportional\nto \u03b14 m c2 /h (\u03bc/\u03bcb ) or \u03b12 (\u03bc/\u03bcb ) Ry.\nComparing frequencies with different scaling behaviour, one can look for variations of the fundamental\nconstants and nuclear magnetic moments. An important part of those comparisons is the so-called absolute\nfrequency measurements. An absolute measurement of a frequency is actually its comparison to the hfs of Cs,\nbecause of the definition of second via the Cs hfs interval\n\u03bdhfs (133 Cs) = 9 9192 631.770 kHz\n\n(exactly) .\n\n(1)\n\nAnother possibility is to study some corrections. E. g. the study of relativistic corrections to the atomic gross\nstructure or hfs can yield to detection of possible variations of the fine structure constants, while investigations\nof the electronic-vibrational-rotational lines can give limitations for the variation of the proton-to-nuclear mass\nratio. Due to the importance of the value in Eq.(1) let us to discuss corrections to the hfs in some detail. The\nvalue of the hyperfine splitting in an atomic state can be presented in the form\n\u03bdhfs = c0 \u03b12\n\n\u03bc\nRy Frel (\u03b1) ,\n\u03bcb\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bc stands for the nuclear magnetic moment, c0 is a constant specific for the atomic state and all dependence\non \u03b1 is contained in a function Frel (\u03b1), which is also specific for the state. The function is associated with the\nrelativistic corrections and Frel (0) = 1. The corrections are more important for high Z and in the case of low\nZ (e. g. for the hydrogen hfs) they are negligible.\n\n1.2\n\nVariable particle, atomic and nuclear properties\n\nThere are three possibilities for the variation of fundamental properties, which can be studied within spectroscopic methods:\n\u2022 effects due to electromagnetic interactions and value of electromagnetic coupling constant \u03b1 (study of\n1s \u2212 2s, comparison of the gross and fine structure, study of relativistic corrections);\n\u2022 effects of quark-quark and quark-gluon strong interactions and nucleon properties like \u03bcp , \u03bcn , mp etc\n(study of the hfs of hydrogen and light nuclei, or molecular electronic-vibrational-rotational lines);\n\u2022 nuclear properties (moments and masses) due to the structure of heavy nuclei. Some of those properties\n(like magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments) can be studied by means of atomic and molecular\nspectroscopy. Nuclear decay rates and scattering cross sections of nuclear collisions can be investigated\nby other methods.\nWe mainly consider here applications of the precision spectroscopy. Experiments with the hfs of heavy\natoms (e. g. Cs, Rb, Yb+ or Hg+ ) cannot have any clear interpretation: any of the values are proportional to\na non-relativistic matrix element, but with significant relativistic corrections (see Eq.(2)). The non-relativistic\nvalue is proportional to a magnetic moment of the nucleus, which includes the moments of one or two valence\nprotons and neutrons and some contribution of an internal nuclear motion. The last is not a pure effect of the\nstrong interactions and an influence of electromagnetic interactions can be estimated from the proton-neutron\nasymmetry.\nIf we keep in mind a general picture, we have to expect a kind of \"grand unification\" theory and there has\nto be some direct relations between coupling constants for weak, electromagnetic and strong interactions (see\ne. g. [5, 3]). Hence, all fundamental constants (i. e. \u03b1, \u03b1s and \u03b1w ) are expected to vary within about the same\n2\n\n\frate. Indeed, different atomic, molecular or nuclear properties can have quite different sensitivities to variations\nof the coupling constants.\nIt is necessary to emphasise that it is incorrect to think that some values like proton-electron mass ratio or\nnuclear g-factor are expected to be relatively constant, while the electromagnetic coupling constant \u03b1 varies,\nas is expected in the interpretation of some papers. The bare electron mass is a result of the interaction with\nthe Higgs field [6] and it has significant quantum electrodynamical corrections due to the renormalization. The\nbare u- and d-quark masses also appear from the Standard model as a result of interaction with the Higgs sector\nand are a few Mev. However, the actual masses of the proton and neutron are determined by the masses of the\nconstituent quarks, which are about 300 Mev and those values are completely a result of the dynamic effects of\nthe QCD in a strong coupling range. The same is true with the proton and neutron magnetic moments. Such\na value, appearing as a result of the strong interactions, is definitely a function of the strong coupling constant,\nwhich is expected to vary together with the electromagnetic and weak coupling constants.\nLet us consider the electron mass in more detail. A standard interpretation of quantum electrodynamics\n(QED) is that it has to be possible to explain all low-energy (with respect to the Planck mass Mp ) physical\nphenomena, using only few effective low-energy parameters (like renormalized electron mass and charge etc).\nThe origin of those values is not important. However, in the case of the search for variations of the constants\nit is necessary to study the origin of the low-energy parameters, like the electron mass. The bare electron mass\nm0 is to be renormalized due to the QED effects. In the one-loop approximation on can find\n\"\n\u00132 #\n\u0012\n3 \u03b1\n\u039b\nme = m0 1 +\n,\n(3)\nln\n4 \u03c0\nm0\nwhere the \u039b is an effective cut-off of the ultraviolet divergence. If the cut-off is associated with the Planck scale\n\u039b = Mp \u223c 1.2 * 1019 Gev \u223c 2.4 * 1021 me , the logarithmic correction is about 20% of the leading term. One can\nsee that, even in the case of a constant value of m0 , the actual electron mass me has to vary with \u03b1.\nFrom a theoretical point of view we can rather expect a primary variation of some parameters which are\nnot visible directly in our low-energy world and this forces some secondary variations of the coupling constants.\nE. g. in the inflatory universe (see Ref. [3] for detail), some effective Higgs potentials depend on the average\ntemperature, which is a function of the time. That have led to some phase transition in the past, when the\nhot universe was cooling. We think that even in our \"cool\" universe we can expect some slow time variation of\nthose Higgs potentials and perhaps their long-scale space variation. The variations of the constants is to be a\ndirect consequence of that.\nAnother and more sophisticated idea [7] was proposed due to the so-called Kaluza-Klein theories, which are\nassociated with a world of 4 + N dimensions. In contrast to \"our\" 4 dimensions, the extra spatial N dimensions\nform a compact manifold with a radius Rkk about Planck length (\u223c 10\u221233 cm). While our four dimensional\nuniverse is expanding, Marciano suggested that value of Rkk is also not constant. However, in the Kaluza-Klein\ntheory this value is associated with the coupling constants of our world.\nSo, we expect that the variation of different coupling constants has to have the same scale. However, it\nis necessary to remember that due to the strong coupling any effective parameters coming from the strong\ninteractions, can have a kind of random variation. We cannot often know which quantity is varied more (or less)\nrapidly than the fundamental constants. That is why we have to try with several ways as different as possible.\nNo model on a possible dependence of the values of the fundamental constants has not been assumed in\nour paper. However, we must underline, that we consider a picture of simultaneous variations of all coupling\nconstants, which particularly determine all property of particles, nuclei, atoms and molecules.\nWe have not yet specified a term \"variations\". To our mind there are actually two possibilities for those:\n\u2022 A time and/or space variation over all the universe with a cosmological scale (T \u223c 1010 yr and L \u223c c * 1010\nyr).\n\u2022 Time and/or space fluctuations over some less, but significantly cosmological, scale (T \u223c 108 \u2212 109 yr and\nL \u223c c * (108 \u2212 109 ) yr).\nSuch a fluctuation of the gravitation interaction was considered [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] due to a periodicity in the\ngalaxies distributions in the direction of the Galactic north and south poles [14]. The fluctuations of gravitation\nis also one of the explanations of possible variations to the solar year [12].\nThe variation can be induced e. g. by cooling of the universe and a variation of some effective Higgs\npotentials. We have no a priori estimation for the speed of the variations. We expect the cosmological time\nand space scale (T and L), but we have no idea on the amplitude of the possible variations. The expected\n3\n\n\famplitude particularly depends on our assumption if we expect some kind of a primary direct variation of the\nconstants, or their variations are a consequence of variations of some other parameters. E. g. let us pretend\nthat the primary variation is due to the compactification radius Rkk and there is no variation of the coupling\nconstants on the unperturbed level. Nevertheless, the variations have to appear due to the renormalization and\nthe time-dependence is to be of the relative order \u03b1 ln Rkk (t). Particularly, following QED one can find in the\none-loop approximation an expression for the fine structure constant\n\u03b1=\n\n\u03b10\n1\u2212\n\n1 \u03b10\n3 \u03c0\n\nP\n\nj cj\n\nqj2 ln \u039b/mj\n\n\u00012 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u039b \u2243 h\u0304/cRkk , the sum is over all fundamental charged particles (leptons, quarks, W -bosons, Higgs\nparticles etc), mj stands for their masses, qj is for their charges. The coefficient cj is dependent on their spin\nand particularly for 1/2 it is equal to one. A significant variation of Rkk (e. g. 1%) can induce a variation of\n\u03b1 only on a level between 10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22125 . The extra \u03b1 and the logarithm reduce the amplitude of the variation\ndramatically. However, it is important to note, that the variation of the mass in Eq.(3) with \u039b = Rkk (t) and\nof the charge in Eq.(4) are to be of the same origin and of about the same order. That example shows that the\nvariation \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 can be small and that the mass variation \u2206m/m and the coupling constant variation can be of\nthe same order and vary simultaneously. Actually comparing Eqs.(3) and (4) one can note that the variation\nof the mass can be larger, smaller or of the same order of magnitude as the variation of the coupling constant.\nMass variations smaller or of the same order as the coupling constant have been discussed above. The larger\nmass variation can appear if we suggest that there is no direct variation of the coupling constants, but the\nmasses vary e. g. due to some variation of the effective Higgs potential of the Standard Model. The \u03b1-variation\nhas to appear from Eq.(4) because of the m-variation in the logarithm. We conclude that a priori it is not\nfeasible to dismiss the mass variation and to consider only varying coupling constants.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nNon-laboratory search for variations of the fundamental constants\nGeochemical data and nuclear properties\n\nNuclear reactions (collisions, decay etc) often involve some relatively small differences of large contributions.\nE. g. to understand if any isotope is stable for a particular channel of decay, one has to compare the initial\nand final binding energy. A problem of the stability is a problem of this difference, which is sometimes quite\nsmall. Relatively small shifts in particle masses or coupling constants can make the decay of a stable isotope\npossible, or disturb an allowed decay. The variation of the coupling constant of strong, electromagnetic or weak\ninteractions can be weakly limited, but the geochemical estimations take advantage of long term comparisons.\nThe study of the abundance of some isotopes allows one to make a comparisons over a geophysical scale of 109\nyr.\n2.1.1\n\nGeochemical data\n\nSome estimations of possible variations of the coupling constants of strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions from geophysical, or rather, geochemical data were performed in Refs. [15, 16, 18, 17, 19, 2, 21, 22, 23]\n(see review in Refs. [2, 4] for more references). Some examinations also include data on the abundance of some\nisotopes in the meteorites, and so the results are, in part, astrochemical ones.\nThe typical limits are\n1 \u2202\u03b1\n< 5 * 10\u221213 \u2212 3 * 10\u221215 yr\u22121 ,\n\u03b1 \u2202t\n1 \u2202\u03b1s\n< 5 * 10\u221211 \u2212 2 * 10\u221211 yr\u22121\n\u03b1s \u2202t\nand\n1 \u2202\u03b1w\n< 10\u221210 yr\u22121 .\n(5)\n\u03b1w \u2202t\nOne problem with the interpretation of those data is the authors assumed of Refs. [2, 18, 20, 21, 22] that only\ncoupling constants vary, while the masses of the proton, the neutron and the electron are constant. Conversely,\nwe expect those to vary as well, and some nuclear effects are sensitive to that variation. Particularly, the \u03b2-decay\nmust be very sensitive to their difference\nmn \u2212 mp \u2212 me .\n4\n\n\fWe should remember that often the violation of the isotopic invariance and particularly the small difference of\nthe proton and neutron masses\nmn \u2212 mp\n\u223c 0.14%\n(6)\nmp\nis associated with electromagnetic effects.\nNext, it was assumed that it is possible to look for a variation of some particular constant (e. g. \u03b1) while\nothers are really constant. We cannot accept such an evaluation, but nevertheless we would like to underline,\nthat the nuclear property can be very sensitive to a variation of the constants, because the decay rates are\nstrongly dependent on the transition energy, which is actually a small difference of two larger energies of initial\nand final states. Both include contributions of the electromagnetic interactions and the difference can be quite\nsensitive to these.\nAnother important problem is timing. Geochemical clocks are based on the study of the abundance of some\nlong-living isotopes and others associated with them. A long lifetime is a result of a small value of the transition\neither matrix element or energy. Both, being small, are sensitive to the same variation of the constants. To the\nbest of our knowledge there have been no discussions on a correlation between the clock and the variation.\n2.1.2\n\nGeochemical data from Oklo reactor\n\nShlyakhter [24] introduced two important elements in the study of nuclear reactions. First, he pointed out\nthat laboratory investigations of nuclear property can also give reasonable limitations (see section 3.1). His\nother idea was due to the recently discovered Oklo Fossil reactor in Gabon (West Africa). That is a natural\nfission reactor (see review in Refs. [25, 26]), and conditions for its existence are very narrow. Investigating\nthose conditions and the local abundance of different isotopes (particularly Sm) it is possible to derive some\nlimitations such that it had operated 1.7 billions years ago for a period from 0.6 to 1.5 millions years. The\nlimits from Ref. [24] are\n1 \u2202\u03b1\n< 1 * 10\u221217 yr\u22121 ,\n\u03b1 \u2202t\n1 \u2202\u03b1s\n< 1 * 10\u221218 yr\u22121\n\u03b1s \u2202t\nand\n\n1 \u2202\u03b1w\n< 4 * 10\u221212 yr\u22121 .\n\u03b1w \u2202t\n\n(7)\n\nOne evidence of the operation of the nuclear reactor in the past was isotope compositions of some elements\nlike samarium, europium and gadolinium. Some of their isotopes (149 Sm, 151 Eu, 155 Gd and 157 Gd) are strong\nneutron absorbers and they have been found in very small quantities with respect to the natural abundance.\nThey have simply been burned by the flux of thermal neutrons. A study of such isotopes can give information\non the fundamental constants at a time when the fossil reactor was operating. Particularly, the limitations in\nEqs.(7) have appeared because of the resonance\n149\n\nSm + n \u2192 150 Sm + \u03b3 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhich has an energy of only 97.3 meV. Two isotopes of samarium (147 and 149) have been studied. The halftime\nof the isotopes is presented in Table 11 . The cross sections of reaction in Eq.(8) and a similar one for\n147\n\nSm + n \u2192 148 Sm + \u03b3 ,\n\n(9)\n\ndiffer by about two orders of magnitude because of the resonance. Studying the 147 Sm/149 Sm ratio one can\ndeduce a possible variation of the position of the resonance from when the reactor was operating to the present\nday. The strength of the limitations in Eqs.(7) has three reasons:\n\u2022 the sensitivity of the abundance of samarium isotopes to the position of the resonance;\n\u2022 the fact that the resonance energy (\u223c 100 meV) has to be compared with a well of the nuclear potential\n(\u223c 50 Mev) i. e. it is 5 * 108 times larger then the energy;\n\u2022 large time separation (\u223c 2 * 109 yr).\n5\n\n\fIsotopes\n\n147\n148\n149\n150\n\nHalftime\n\n1.06 * 1011 yr\n7 * 10\n\n13\n\n> 2 * 10\n\nyr\n\n15\n\nstable\n\nyr\n\nNatural\n\nNeutron separation\n\nabundance\n\nenergy Sn [keV]\n\n15.0%\n\n6342(3)\n\n11.3%\n\n8141.5(6)\n\n13.8%\n\n5871.6(9)\n\n7.4%\n\n7985.7(7)\n\nTable 1: Properties of some samarium isotopes.\n\nAfter publication of Ref. [24] the Oklo data have been re-evaluated by a number of authors [26, 28, 4, 29, 30].\nThe evaluations were concentrated on the samarium abundance. Particularly, it was pointed out in Ref. [30]\nthat for the limitations for the strong coupling constant it is unlikely to be appropriate to compare the position\nof the resonance to the well of the nucleon-nucleon potential, which is essentially of use only in the few-body\nproblem. In the case of many-body effect (like the resonance) it was suggested to consider a neutron separation\nenergy Sn (see Table 1) as a characteristic reference value. The latter is 6\u20138 Mev and significantly smaller than\nthe well (\u223c 50 Mev).\nInvestigations of other isotopes were not as effective in setting limits. Some estimations due to europium\nwere presented by Shlyakhter, while gadolinium was studied in Ref. [30]. But the studies did not yield such\nstrong limitations as the investigations of the samarium isotopes.\nResults for the variation of the fine structure constant from the Oklo reactor study are collected in Table 2.\nThe most recent estimates are [29]\n1 \u2202\u03b1\n= \u22121.4(54) * 10\u221217 yr\u22121 ,\n\u03b1 \u2202t\n1 \u2202\u03b1w\n< 1 * 10\u221211 yr\u22121 ,\n(10)\n\u03b1w \u2202t\nand [30]\n1\n\u03b1\n1\n\u03b1s\n\n\u2202\u03b1\n< 1.0 * 10\u221217 yr\u22121 ,\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03b1s\n< 1.3 * 10\u221218 yr\u22121 .\n\u2202t\n\n(11)\n\nThose results cannot be used directly, because of the same reasons as those for other geochemical data. Particularly, the timing was based on the abundance of strong absorbers of thermal neutrons and any influence of the\nvariation of the constants on utilized cross sections was not investigated. Variation of the fine structure constant\nwas analyzed only with respect to the static Coulomb interaction energy of the proton in the nucleus. However,\nwe have to expect that a small part of the proton and neutron masses is a result of electromagnetic interactions\nand hence any variations of \u03b1 lead to a shift in these masses and of the kinetic energy. Indeed only a small part\nof the kinetic energy is of this electromagnetic origin. However the entire kinetic energy is much larger than the\nstatic Coulomb interaction and eventually both electromagnetic contributions can be compatible.\nConcerning two different recent results on the fine structure constant we note that in Ref. [30] more recent\nand accurate data on the samarium isotopic composition were used, while in Ref. [29] the estimation of the\ntemperature was more secure. We also have to point out that it is unclear how much the neutron flux during\nthe operation time of the reactor used in Refs. [29, 30] is sensitive to the possible variation of the constants.\nWe think a proper way is to determine the flux and a possible variation simultaneously.\n2.1.3\n\nNucleosynthesis\n\nSome estimations due to Big Bang nucleosynthesis have also been performed [31, 32] in a similar way to the\ngeochemical study. A possible variation of the fine structure constant is not larger than (1 \u2212 2) * 10\u221212 yr\u22121 .\n1 Nuclear\n\ndata (and particularly in Tables 1, 7 and 11) have been taken from Ref. [27], when the reference is not specified.\n\n6\n\n\f\u2202ln\u03b1/\u2202t\n\nRef.\n\n< 1 * 10\u221217 yr\u22121\n< 2 * 10\n\n\u22121.4(54) * 10\n< 1.0 * 10\n\n[24]\n\nyr\n\n\u22121\n\n\u221217\n\nyr\n\n\u221218\n\n\u221217\n\n[28]\n\u22121\n\nyr\n\n\u22121\n\n[29]\n[30]\n\nTable 2: Limits for the \u03b1 variation from Oklo.\n\nThis cosmological estimate takes an advantage of a large time separation between the epoch of nucleosynthesis\nand the present day which is about the lifetime of the universe, i. e. about 1010 yr.\n\n2.2\n\nAstrophysical data\n\n2.2.1\n\nAbsorption lines in quasar spectra\n\nAn advantage of astrophysical studies is a possibility of a long term comparison. A typical astrophysical time\nassociated with extragalactic sources (quasars) is up to 1010 yr. Due to the long reference time the accuracy\nof spectroscopic measurements need not be high. It is also possible to look for corrections (like me /mp terms\nin H2 spectrum). A key point of any astrophysical study is a comparison of observed lines with a data base of\nlines collected under laboratory conditions in order to determine a value of the redshift\n\u0001\n\u03bbobs = \u03bb0 1 + z\n(12)\nand, hence, a time separation between the epoch of the absorption and the epoch of the observation t(z). This\ndepends on the choice of evolution parameters of the universe and can vary by a factor two for the same z.\nWhen the lines are identified, one can try to interpret spectroscopic data in terms of variations of transition\nfrequencies. It is quite important to determine the redshift and look for the variation simultaneously. When\none does this separately it is equivalent to an assumption on the stability of particular transitions. E. g. in Ref.\n[33], the authors used the redshift from the observation of some astrophysical data on the hydrogen hfs line,\nand so they actually assumed within the evaluation that the \u03b12 \u03bcp /\u03bcb Ry is a stable value2 and this led to some\nmisinterpretation.\nA comparison of frequencies with different scaling behaviours is described in Sect. 1.2. Particularly, Savedoff\n[35] pointed out this application for the comparison of atomic lines. Thompson first noted that molecular spectra\ncould be used to examine the variation of the nuclear masses [36]. An analysis of absorption lines of molecular\nhydrogen in a quasar spectrum can possibly provide a limit for the variation of the proton-to-electron mass\nratio. Such an evaluation is based on the Born-Oppenheimer approximation of the molecular spectrum\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0010 m \u00111/2\n\u0010m \u0011\ne\ne\n\u03bdmol = Ry ce + cv\n+ ... ,\n(13)\n+ cr\nM\nM\n\nwhere ci are dimensionless parameters of order O(1). The dominate term ce is determined by the electronic\nstructure, the second is due to the vibrational excitations, while the third one is associated with the rotational\nlevels. Comparing levels with the same electronic structure (the same a), it is possible to study two other terms\nand to limit the variation of the electron-to-proton mass ratio from the H2 spectrum. Value M is associated\nwith some nuclear mass, particularly in the case of diatomic molecules it is the reduced mass of two nuclei. It\nis important for applications that the coefficients ci can be found both theoretically and experimentally. The\nlatter is possible by studying different isotopes, particularly the reduced mass M for H2 , HD, D2 etc varies\nenough to allow this (see e. g. Ref. [33]).\nAn examination of the molecular lines, or a comparison of the rotational and vibrational transitions with\nthe gross structure yields a variation of me /mp . In contrast to this a comparison of the rotational terms to the\n2 That\n\nwas pointed out in Ref. [34].\n\n7\n\n\fhfs in the hydrogen atom yields a limit for the \u03b12 gp variation. Analysis of the molecular lines was performed in\nRef. [37, 38], while in Refs. [39, 40, 33, 41, 34] the authors preferred to compare the rotational and vibrational\ntransitions with the hfs of the hydrogen atom. The most accurate results are collected in Table 3.\nA comparison of the gross structure to the fine structure of some ions presented in Refs. [42, 43, 44, 45, 46,\n40, 33, 47, 38, 48, 49] gave limitations on the variations of \u03b12 . Variations of the same value can be found after\nstudying the relativistic corrections. The most recent results were obtained in [50], where an evaluation of data\nfor some of Fe+ and Mg+ lines was performed. The variation of the fine structure constant was obtained from\na study of relativistic corrections, calculations for which were presented separately in Ref. [51, 52].\nThe hfs of atomic hydrogen was examined with respect to the gross structure in Refs. [43, 40] and with\nrespect to the fine structure in Refs. [43, 33]. The former of those examinations is for possible variations of\n\u03b12 (\u03bcp /\u03bcb ), while the latter is for \u03bcp /\u03bcb . The strongest astrophysical limitations are summarized in Table 3,\nwhere we give variations for actually measured values. References to previous, less precise results can be found\nin quoted articles and in Ref. [44].\n\nValue\n\nRef.\n\n\u2202 ln(< value >)/\u2202t\n[yr\u22121 ]\n\nme /mp\n\n[37]\n\nme /mp\n\n[40]\n\nme /mp\n\n[47]\n\nme /mp\n\n[38]\n\n\u03b12\n\n[46]\n\n\u03b12\n\n[45]\n\n\u03b12\n\n[40]\n\n\u03b12\n\n[33]\n\n\u03b12\n\n[38]\n\n\u03b12\n\n[50, 51]\n\n\u03b12\n\n[48]\n\n\u03b12 gp\n\n[33]\n\n\u03b12 gp\n\n[34, 41]\n\n\u03b12 \u03bcp /\u03bcb\n\n[43]\n\n\u03b12 \u03bcp /\u03bcb\n\n[40]\n\n< 3 * 10\u221213\n\n\u22120.8(35) * 10\u221214\n< 2 * 10\u221214\n\n9(6) * 10\u221215\n< 6 * 10\u221214\n< 4 * 10\u221214\n\n1.0(35) * 10\u221214\n< 3 * 10\u221214\n< 5 * 10\u221215\n\n0.4(51) * 10\u221215\n< 5 * 10\u221215\n< 2 * 10\u221214\n< 2 * 10\u221215\n< 2 * 10\u221214\n\n\u22121.0(13) * 10\u221215\n\nTable 3: Possible variations of the constants from astrophysics.\n\n2.2.2\n\nBackground radiation\n\nAn analysis of microwave background radiation data to be obtained in the near future is expected to give a\nlimitation for a variation of the fine structure constant of 10\u221212 \u2212 10\u221213 yr \u22121 [53, 54].\n\n3\n\nLaboratory search\n\nThe limitations from Eq.(10) and Table 3 are stronger than possible in any laboratory experiments. However,\nto our mind, the most reliable limitations can be achieved only under laboratory conditions and there are a few\nvery different ways to determine limits for possible variations of the fundamental constants.\n8\n\n\f3.1\n\nLaboratory nuclear data\n\nAs has been mentioned, Shlyakhter noted that the laboratory study of some nuclear properties can give reasonable limitations for variations of the constants [24]. He considered some very low-lying resonances, the energies\nof which are extremely small differences of large quantities and those must be sensitive to small variations of\nparameters. The positions of some of these resonances had been known with enough accuracy for about 10\nyears and an estimate\n1 \u2202\u03b1s\n< 4 * 10\u221212 yr\u22121\n(14)\n\u03b1s \u2202t\nwas obtained [24]. The difference between this approach and others was that the most sensitive values were\nstudied, whereas others investigated easily available data from geochemistry. Such a test is free of the timing\nproblem, although, Schlyakhter's analysis has been performed under the assumption of particle masses stability.\nUnfortunately, to the best of our knowledge this idea has not been developed further. Actually the estimations\n[24] from laboratory data were competitive with ordinary geochemical data examined that time. However, that\nis not ture in the case of the Oklo reactor.\nWe think that it is necessary to examine the data base of low-lying resonances. Even, if there is no progress\nin measurement, the limitation in Eq.(14) is reduced by a factor of about 3.5. That is a result of adjustment of\nanalysis by Shlyakhter, who claimed in 1976, that the positions of the resonances had not been shifted for 10\nyears.\n\n3.2\n\nClock comparison\n\nAnother example for a laboratory search would be a comparison of different clocks looking for any variation\nduring a relatively short time (\u2264 1 year) [55, 57]. Ref. [55] presented a one-year comparison of hyperfine structure\nof Cs to the fine structure of 24 Mg. Another limit on a possible variation of the ratio of the frequencies from\nthe same authors [56] is 2.6 * 10\u221213 yr\u22121 , though, the data seems to be the same. They neglected relativistic\ncorrections in their evaluation and gave some interpretation based on that.\nAnother recent comparison of the Hg+ clock (based on the hfs transition) and hydrogen clock for 140\ndays [57] led to a limit of 1.7 * 10\u221214 yr\u22121 . The original result was presented in terms of the fine structure\nconstant which was derived from relativistic corrections to the nonrelativistic formula. The authors of Ref. [57]\nunderlined the importance of relativistic effects. We would like to point out that the treatment of the Cs hfs\nin Ref. [55] is just the opposite: while here the relativistic corrections were neglected [55], the others believe\nthat the corrections are crucially important [57]. The results from different clock comparisons are collected in\nTable 4. We give here the limits for possible variations of the ratio of the frequencies and dismiss any original\ninterpretations. We include also an H\u2013Cs comparison for 1 year at the PTB [60] with a result 5.5 * 10\u221214 yr\u22121\nand at U. S. Navy Observatory [61], as has been interpreted in Ref. [57]. We would also like to mention a\nresult of Ref. [62] because the clock was quite different from others. A 12-days comparison of a Cs clock to\na new standard based on and SCSO (superconductivity-cavity stabilized oscillator [63]) was performed. The\nfrequency of the standard depends on its size, which is taken as proportional to the Bohr radius. This is correct\nin a nonrelativistic approximation, and it is not quite clear how to estimate the relativistic corrections.\n\nTransitions\n\nRef.\n\n\u2202 ln(< value >)/\u2202t\n[yr\u22121 ]\n\nhfs of Cs to SCSO\nfs of\n\n24\n\nMg to hfs of Cs\n\n[62]\n[55]\n\nhfs of H to hfs of Cs\n\n[60]\n\nhfs of H to hfs of Cs\n\n[61]\n\nhfs of Hg+ to hfs of H\n\n[57]\n\n< 1.5 * 10\u221212\n\n\u22122.5(23) * 10\u221213\n< 5 * 10\u221214\n< 5 * 10\u221214\n\n< 2.7 * 10\u221214\n\nTable 4: Clock comparisons and possible variations in frequencies of the standards.\n\n9\n\n\fRef. [57] in the most important one in the table, because the hydrogen-to-cesium comparisons are taken\nfrom there and because of discussions on the relativistic effects. We discuss the interpretation of the hyperfine\nseparation in Sect. 5, but here we comment on some statements of Ref. [57].\n\u2022 The correcting function for the relativistic effects Frel (Z\u03b1) used there was not quite correct. The authors\ndid not give enough explanations and to briefly discuss their evaluation we would like to mention a few\npoints:\n- The relativistic correcting function Frel (Z\u03b1) was given with some analytic expression, while the nonrelativistic term was possible to find only within an empirical formulae. Indeed, that is inconsistent.\nThe function was expected to be valid for any alkali atoms including hydrogen-like and Li-like atoms.\nThe result for Frel (Z\u03b1) is n-independent and it was claimed to be valid for S1/2 levels, while rather\nit should be n-dependent (see e. g. Ref. [58]). Particularly, the result used in Ref. [57] is in disagreement with both 1s and 2s results for a hydrogen-like atom with a nuclear charge Z [58]. In the\ncase of low-Z the results for a hydrogen-like atom are\nFrel (Z\u03b1) \u2243 1 +\n\n11\n(Z\u03b1)2 + . . . ,\n6\n\nF1s (Z\u03b1) \u2243 1 +\n\n3\n(Z\u03b1)2 + . . . ,\n2\n\n[58] ,\n\n(16)\n\nF2s (Z\u03b1) \u2243 1 +\n\n17\n(Z\u03b1)2 + . . . ,\n8\n\n[58] .\n\n(17)\n\nand\n\n[57] ,\n\n(15)\n\n- Actually, the calculation of the Casimir correction\n3\n1\nFrel (Z\u03b1) = p\n2\n2\n3\n\u2212\n4(Z\u03b1)\n1 \u2212 (Z\u03b1)\n\n(18)\n\nhas been performed under the condition that the relativistic corrections can appear only when the\nelectron is close to the nucleus and hence they are proportional to a squared value of the wave function\nat the origin [59]. That is correct for heavy (Z \u226b 1) and slightly charged (z \u226a Z, where z is an\neffective charge for a valence electron) alkali atoms. Indeed that is incorrect for hydrogen. Actually,\nthe corrections for hydrogen are small, and it is enough to reproduce a correct order of magnitude.\n- Recalculation in Ref. [52] gave results for \u2202 ln(Frel (Z\u03b1))/\u2202\u03b1, which are different from the Casimir\ncalculation\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2202 ln Frel (Z\u03b1)\n(Z\u03b1)2 11 \u2212 12(Z\u03b1)2\n\u0011\n\u0011\u0010\n(19)\n= \u0010\n\u2202 ln \u03b1\n1 \u2212 (Z\u03b1)2 3 \u2212 4(Z\u03b1)2\n\nwithin about 10%. The results are 2.30 for Hg+ and 0.83 for Cs [52] instead of 2.2 and 0.74 [57]. Actually the mercury ion is not an alkali one, but since all subshells are closed the Casimir approximation\nhas to work and that has been confirmed by the many-body calculation [52].\n\n\u2022 The authors assumed that there are no corrections to the nuclear g-factor which depend on the strong\ncoupling constant. Actually that means that the magnetic moment of any nucleus is to be understood\nin terms of a pure kinematic description (spin and orbital contributions) with high accuracy. That is\ndefinitely not the case (see Sect. 5 for detail). The corrections do not grow with increase of the nuclear\ncharge Z, but nevertheless they are large enough for a number of values of Z in a broad range. Particularly,\nfor tritium (Z = 1) such effects shift a value of the nuclear magnetic moment by 7% (cf. Eq.(18) with\nZ = 26). Even in the case of a pure kinematic model, it is incorrect to neglect variations of gp and gn ,\nwhich contribute differently to magnetic moments of hydrogen, rubidium, cesium and mercury (see Sect.\n5 for detail).\n\u2022 The hydrogen maser was tried intensively as a candidate for the primary frequency standard about 30\nyears ago. A crucial problem was low long-time stability and it has not been improved up-to-now. That\nmeans that the maser frequency can disagree with the transition frequency and varies with the time\nbecause of different effects, particularly, a wall-shift. Comparison of anything with the hydrogen maser\nitself makes no sense. Actually, the authors of Refs. [60, 61] make no statement on a possible variation of\nany transition frequency, and the interpretation in Table 4 is from Ref. [57].\n10\n\n\fThe best limits for the annual variations of the constants from the clock (see Table 4) are on the level of a\nfew units in 1014 but it is not quite clear if any direct interpretation of such a comparison is actually possible.\nA clock is a device designed to maintain some frequency in the most stable way. An equality of the maintained\nfrequency to any atomic transition frequency is not necessary, and, actually, it is not quite clear, if any clock\nfrequency agrees with the transition one within an accuracy on the level of its reproducibility. We expect that,\nif it were to agree it would be no problem to have better limitations by just searching for a longer time.\nIn particular, we expect that variations of a frequency of any maser standards should also be determined by\nthe cavity size (cf. SCSO standard [62]). The frequency of the hydrogen hfs transition is not itself important\nin some sense for the hydrogen maser. When the hfs frequency and the size of the resonator are inconsistent\nthe standard cannot work, and when they are consistent (within the line width) everything is determined by\nthe cavity. That is indeed a reason why there are a lot of possibilities of drifts for the frequency from the maser\nstandard. Such a maser, without any tuning of the cavity size is called a passive maser . On the other hand in\nthe case of active maser there is an adjustment of the cavity size to the hydrogen hfs studying the efficiency of\nthe maser. In this case the dependence on the variation of the constants is more complicated.\nIt is known that hydrogen masers can have high short-time stability. But there is no a priori statement\napplicable to any particular hydrogen maser, after a rather preliminary study of these. The study assumes some\ncomparisons with either another known standard, or a wide representative ensemble of masers. In both cases,\nany later comparison with that maser assumes that is consistent with some other standard and that the stability\nproperty (e. g. short-term stability) does not vary with time. This is an indirect comparison with something\nelse via the maser. In the case of a 140 day comparison the maser stability and agreement between the maser\nfrequency and the hydrogen hfs are questionable and the stability may only be a result of preliminary study of\nthe maser frequency with respect to some other standard.\nWe think that the clock comparison can give reliable limits only in two cases:\n\u2022 The clock frequency is expressed in terms of the transition frequency. But that means, that with the clock\ncomparison one can measure the transition frequency as well. We consider some of possibility for search\nwith the precise frequency measurements below (see Sect. 3.3).\n\u2022 There are a number of different standards with the same transition (like in the case of Cs). They should\nfirst be compared with each others and then we can estimate possible deviations from some effective\nfrequency that depends on the transition rather than on the clock. This is not as secure as a direct\ndetermination of the transition frequency, but it is more or less reliable.\nIn the case where some particular transition is applied in only a single clock, it is absolutely unclear, which\ndrifts or fluctuations are properties of the clock and which are properties of the transition.\n\n3.3\n\nPrecise frequency measurements\n\nPrecision spectroscopy provides us with other ways to search for the variation of the fundamental constants.\nThe most straightforward method is to obtain a high accuracy and to compare two results (let us say, one\ntaken a year after the other). It is also possible to make a comparison of results obtained now with some\nrelatively old ones for the frequency of atomic or molecular transitions measured better than 10\u221211 . Tables of\nthe most accurately measured values of any transition frequencies are presented below. Table 5 contains the\nbest radiofrequency results, while Table 6 is for the optical transitions. The tables contain the results obtained\nfrom 1967 to the present with a fractional uncertainty below 10\u221211 . One can see that some older results are\ncompetitive with the newer ones. In the tables we give a possible limit of variation of the frequency if the new\nexperimental value is to be obtained in the year 2000 and with some higher accuracy. If the precision is about\nthe same, one should also take into consideration an uncertainty in\n\u221a the newer measurement. So, the final limit\nhas to be larger than that given in the tables by a factor between 2 (if the uncertainties are independent) and\n2 (when they are strongly correlated). In our evaluation we consider the date of publication as the date of the\nmeasurement, whereas they are slightly different and some shifts may arise from this.\nThe hydrogen hfs is presented in Table 5 with a value from review [64]. We discuss the original results in\nSect. 6.2. The tables mainly indicates some opportunities for experiments in the near future. Except for the\nhydrogen hfs only one value in Table 5 has been accurately and independently measured twice (namely, the hfs\nintervals in the 171 Yb+ atom).

Values for \u2202 ln \u03bd/\u2202t have been calculated under the condition that\nthe frequency will be re-measured in the year 2000 with a better accuracy. The variation of the frequencies is\nassumed with respect to the cesium hfs.\n\nif we suppose that the time separation is 4 years.\nIt is important to note, that even a single laboratory study can give a relatively secure result. In some\nexperiments several traps were used and so they contain an independent measurement in part. Since most of\nthe recent precision investigations have the building of a new standard as a target, some long-term monitoring\nof the measured frequency was often performed. Unfortunately, the published data are rather incomplete, but\nwe expect that some limits on a level between 10\u221212 and 10\u221213 yr\u22121 will be available after complete publications\nof studies giving most of the recent results in Tables 5 and 6.\nThe most precise comparison with one of the results that is already known for some time can be performed\nfor the hydrogen ground state hyperfine structure interval. The possibility to reach a good result has almost\nbeen missed. However, in the case of new experiments, like for rubidium or mercury, it may easily be a shift\nof 1\u20132 sigma afterwards. On the other hand, some new results are going to be presented soon: for the Rb hfs\n(better than 10\u221214 ) and for the 1s \u2212 2s transition in hydrogen (a few units in 1014 ). That means that in the\ncase of any delay the measurement could be not compatible.\nIt is also important to underline that so-called variation-of-constants experiments check different possibilities\nassociated with drifts of primary and secondary standards. A one-year comparison, which can usually be realized\nin a laboratory, is not the same as a kind of \"world wide\" comparison over years. The hydrogen hfs interval is a\nvalue which can be measured in a number of different laboratories now and which was in the past also studied\nin a few different places.\nTwo radio-frequency measurements (namely for tritium and barium) were performed for unstable isotopes\n(T1/2 (T) = 12.3 yr and T1/2 (Ba) = 10.5 yr) and this indicates that the search for appropriate transitions should\nnot be limited to stable isotopes only. We do not mention the radioactivity of rubidium-87 which has a halftime\nof 4.8 * 1010 yr, comparable with the age of the universe.\nWe also have to mention an experiment with the ground state hyperfine structure of 9 Be+ in a strong\nmagnetic field. A splitting between (MI = \u22123/2, MJ = +1/2) and (\u22121/2, +1/2) was determined [81]\n\u03bd = 303 016.377 265 070(57) kHz .\n\n(21)\n\nThe measurement was performed at a field of about 0.8194 T and the splitting was found at its magnetic-fieldindependent point. The fractional uncertainty is 1.9 * 10\u221213 and it was believed [82] that this may be reduced\nto about 1 * 10\u221213 . A further measurement of the splitting in the year 2000 is to give a limit of the variation of\nthe Be-frequency with respect to the cesium standard on level of 1.3 * 10\u221214 .\n12\n\n\fTransition\n\nFrequency (\u03bd)\n\nRef.\n\n[kHz]\nH, 1s \u2212 2s\n\n2 466 061 413 187.34(84)\n\n[74], 1997\n\n799 191 727.402 8(67)\n\n[75], 1999\n\nD, 2s \u2212 12d\n\n799 409 184.967 6(65)\n\n[75], 1999\n\n455 986 240 493.95(43)\n\n[76], 1996\n\n455 986 240 494.13(10)\n\n[77], 1999\n\n444 779 044 095.4(2)\n\n[78], 1999\n\nH, 2s \u2212 12d\n\n40\n\nCa, 3 P1 \u2212 1 S0\n\n88\n\nSr+ , 5S \u2212 4D\n\nCH4 , E-line\n\n88 373 149 028.53(20)\n\nRelative\n\n\u2202 ln \u03bd/\u2202t\n\nuncertainty\n\n[yr\u22121 ]\n\n3.4 * 10\u221213\n\n1.1 * 10\u221213\n\n8.1 * 10\u221212\n\n8.1 * 10\u221212\n\n[79], 1998\n\n8.4 * 10\u221212\n\n9.4 * 10\u221213\n2.5 * 10\u221213\n4.5 * 10\u221213\n\n2.3 * 10\u221212\n\n8.4 * 10\u221212\n2.4 * 10\u221213\n2.5 * 10\u221213\n4.5 * 10\u221213\n1.1 * 10\u221212\n\nTable 6: The most accurate optical measurements and a possible level of limit for the variation of the frequency.\nValues for \u2202 ln \u03bd/\u2202t have been found under the condition that a measurement of the frequency will be repeated\nin the year 2000 with a higher precision.\n\nIn Tables 5 and 6 and Eq.(21) in Fig. 1 we collect all limits of the variations of frequency available in 2000\nin the case of a repetition of the measurements.\n\n4\n\nSome new options for precise comparison of frequencies\n\n4.1\n\nHyperfine structure\n\nFor a while the hyperfine splitting of atomic levels has been a quantity available for the most precise measurements. Comparison of hfs in different atoms can give us precise information on the variation of the nuclear\nmagnetic moment rather than on the fine structure constant.\n\u2022 We start with the hydrogen hfs project. The hyperfine structure interval in the ground state of the\nhydrogen atom was frequently measured (see Sects. 6.1 and 6.2). For a preliminary estimation we accept\na value\n\u03bdhfs (H) = 1420 405.751 766 7(9) kHz ,\n(22)\nwhich used to be presented in reviews (see e. g. Ref. [64]) as a final result for the hfs separation. The\n\u221214\nfractional uncertainty is about 6 parts in 1014 and on being divided by\nyr\u22121 .\n\u221a 30 years that gives 2 * 10\nIf the accuracy is now the same this should rather be multiplied by 2.\n\u2022 Let us consider briefly a possible variation of the deuterium hyperfine separation, which was measured in\n1972 [65] with an uncertainty of 5.2 * 10\u221212. The relative accuracy is much worse than for H (cf. Eq.(22)).\nHowever, the magnetic moment of a deutron (see Table 11) includes a large cancellation\n\u03bc(D) \u2243 \u03bcp + \u03bcn = |\u03bcp | \u2212 |\u03bcn |\n\n(23)\n\nbetween the proton (\u03bcp = 2.793 \u03bcn) and neutron (\u03bcn = \u22121.913 \u03bcn) contributions and this hfs value might\nbe very sensitive to the variation of effective parameters of the strong interactions.\n\u2022 The hfs of the ground state in the 171 Yb+ ion can also provide a limit for the variation per year on a level\nof a few units in 1014 . The most precise measurements are presented in Fig. 2, where the open circles are\nfor preliminary results [83, 84], while the full ones are for final values [70, 71].\nThe disadvantages (in comparison to the hydrogen case) are: a less strong limit for the variation with less\nreliability (the result was reached with a high accuracy in two laboratories, but the precision was different\nby a factor 3).\n13\n\n\f20\n\nLimitation \u03b4/\u2206t [ 10-14 yr-1 ]\n\nD\nT\n\nYb+\n\nH\n\n10\n\nYb+\n\nCa\n\nH\n\nCa\n\nBe+\nHg+\n0\n\n1965\n\n1970\n\n1975\n\n1980\n\n1985\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\nRb\n2000\n\nYear of publication\n\nFigure 1: Strongest possible limits on the variation of the frequencies available in 2000. The limit is defined\nas a fractional uncertainty of the frequency divided by the time from the publication to 2000.\n\u2022 Generally, study of nuclei with small magnetic moments are expected to lead to sensitive tests for possible\nvariations of the proton or neutron magnetic moment. We give a list of stable nuclei with small magnetic\n17\nmoments in Table 7. The tungsten 183\nyr and we include it in the table.\n74 W has a halftime of 1.1 * 10\n\nUp to now, there is no way to measure the nuclear magnetic moment with an accuracy on the level 1011 or\nbetter. For nuclei with spin 1/2, our proposal is to measure the hfs of a neutral atom or ion and to search\nfor a variation of that value. In the case of spin 3/2, a value of the hfs interval is essentially affected by\nthe nuclear quadrupole moment. An exception is 41 K, where the quadrupole term is also small and it is\nworthwhile studying the hfs. Fortunately, the stable nuclei with the smallest magnetic moments (namely,\n57\nFe, 103 Rh and 187 Os) have spin 1/2 and we hope that the accurate study of the hfs of the nuclei with a\nsmall magnetic moment is possible.\n\n\u22123\nThe nuclear magnetic moment of radionuclides can be even smaller, for example, for 198\n\u03bcn ,\n81 Tl (|\u03bc| < 10\n\u2212\n192\n\u2212\n153\nI = 2 , T1/2 = 5.3(5) h), 62 Sm (\u03bc = \u22120.022 \u03bcn, I = 3/2 , T1/2 = 46 h) and 79 Au (\u03bc = \u22120.009(2) \u03bcn,\nI = 1\u2212 , T1/2 = 4.9 h). Our proposal for such isotopes is to measure a value of the shielded magnetic\nmoment of the nucleus, investigating ions with coupled electrons only (Hg-, Os-, W-, Hf-, Ba-, Xe-like etc).\nParticularly, Hg-, Ba- and Xe-like ions have complete subshells and this is an advantage for the study of\n198\nTl. We hope that a method developed in Ref. [85] to study a bound electron g-factor in H-like ions can\nbe applied here. By achieving an uncertainty of about 10\u22129 for the magnetic moment, the limit for the\nvariation of gp is expected to be on the level of 3 * 10\u221213 yr\u22121 . We should mention that not all magnetic\nmoments of radionuclides with a halftime longer than 10 days are known [27] and it might happen, that\nsome of them are even smaller than 10\u22123 \u03bcn .\n\n4.2\n\nFine structure\n\nWhen the fine structure (proportional to \u03b12 Ry) is determined, it can be compared with the gross structure\n(proportional to Ry) and thus yielding a direct limit for a variation of the fine structure constant \u03b1. The gross\nstructure can be taken from measurements with neutral hydrogen and calcium atoms, and with strontium and\nindium ions and, maybe, in the future with other atoms.\n\u2022 To date there are no competitive results on the fs. The best result for the atomic fine structure has been\n14\n\n\fFrequency \u03bd HFS - 12 648 812 124 Hz\n\n0.485 Hz\n0.480 Hz\n0.475 Hz\n0.470 Hz\n0.465 Hz\n0.460 Hz\n1993\n\n1995\n\n1997\n\nYear of publication\n\nFigure 2: Precise study of the hfs interval in the ground state of\n\n171\n\nY b.\n\nreached for the Ba+ ion [86]3\n\u03bdfs (138 Ba+ , 5d2 D3/2 \u2212 5d2 D5/2 ) = 24 012 048 317.17(44) kHz.\n\n(24)\n\nNote that this is for the fs of excited states. We think that some higher accuracy can be achieved by\nstudying the fine structure associated with the ground state. If the subshell with valence p-electrons (or\nd) is open, the lowest excited states are due to the fine structure. The frequency can lie in radio-frequency\nrange and the lines are very narrow. That is because of two reason: the E1 transition is not allowed for\nP \u2212 P transitions and the decay rate is proportional to some power of the low transition frequency. Thus\nthe lowest levels are split due to relativistic effects only and they can be measured accurately. This is\nanother way of measuring the fine structure precisely. In combination with the gross structure, one can\nreach a limit for \u03b1. The interpretation of such a comparison is simpler than in the case of hfs. A similar\nway is to study the relativistic correction for the gross structure is of use for astrophysical data [35]. In\nTable 84 we give a list of the rf transition of the low-lying fine structure in some neutral atoms, while\nthose for different ions are collected in Table 9.\nUnfortunately, there are no systems in the tables which can be easily studied. In the case of neutral atoms\nin Table 8, laser cooling is hard to apply because of the metastable fine structure levels. Finding levels\nwhich are insensitive to the magnetic field is a problem for ions. These are (23 P0 ) in N+ and (3d4 \u2212 5 D0 )\nin V+ . Finding proper means of detection of the fs transition can be another problem for a few-ions trap\nexperiments.\n\u2022 It is also possible to find an optical or infrared transition for the low-lying fine structure. Let us mention\na transition\n\u03bdfs (Pb, 63 P0 \u2212 63 P2 ) \u2243 1.32 eV\n(25)\nin neutral lead, which can be studied by means of two-photon Doppler-free spectroscopy (the wave length\nof each photon is 1.88 \u03bcm). The excited level 3 P2 lives for 2.6 s and it is narrow enough to reach an\naccurate result. It has to be mentioned that in the case of neutral lead, calculations using jj coupling\nare competitive with those using LS one. Actually, a clear separation of non-relativistic and relativistic\nphysics is only possible for LS coupling. LS coupling means that one must first find a non-relativistic\nenergy level with n\u2217 (L) and next to take into account the (relativistic) spin effects. For jj coupling the\n(relativistic) spin effects for individual electrons are more important than a (non-relativistic) interaction\nof their orbital momenta. We expect large relativistic corrections to the fine structure.\nOne possible experiment is presented in Fig. 3. The ground state (6p2 3P0 ) of one of the spinless isotopes of\nlead (204 Pb, natural abundance 1.4%; 206 Pb, 24%; or 208 Pb, 52%) is excited by two photons (\u03bb = 1.878 \u03bcm)\n3 In Refs. [55, 56] a clock, based on fine structure in Mg, was compared with a cesium clock. However, the authors gave no result\nof the fs transition frequency. As I was informed by A. Godone it was expected that the corrections to the fs were well understood\nat least on level of 10\u221212 .\n4 Atomic data (and particularly that in Tables 8, 9 and 10) have been taken from Ref.

The line is narrow because of the metastability and of\nDoppler-free excitation. Detection of the 3 P2 level can be done using an additional one-photon excitation\n(\u03bb = 0.283 \u03bcm) to a 6p7s3 P0 state and measuring the fluorenscence (\u03bb = 0.406 \u03bcm).\n\u2022 Alkali atoms have simple spectra and that is an advantage for both experiment [55, 76, 78, 86, 88] and\ntheory [59, 52]. Measurement of the fine structure of such a system as a test for the variations of \u03b1 was\nproposed by Jungmann [87] (cf. Ref. [35]) particularly for Ca+ and Sr+ ions. Similar measurement can be\nperformed for In+ . All these atoms are now a subject of some investigations as a part of efforts to design\nnew optical standards. Let us discuss shortly the indium case. An accurate result for the fine structure\nmay be obtained by considering the 5s5p \u2212 3 PJ levels in the 115 In+ ion. The fs interval of excited levels\ncannot usually be measured precisely. For an indium ion it may however be determined as the difference\nbetween two gross transitions (5s2 \u22121 S0 \u2212 5s5p\u22123PJ )ith different J. Indeed, since the fs interval is about\n1% of the transition frequency for the gross structure, one can expect that the fractional accuracy is not\nvery high. The advantage is that in the case of very accurate measurements of 5s2 \u2212 1 S0 \u2212 5s5p \u2212 3 P0\nfor different PJ -states, it may be possible to go beyond the accuracy of standards. As an example, let\nus recall the results on the 1s \u2212 2s transition in the hydrogen atom [74] and on the hydrogen-deuterium\nisotopic shift of the 1s \u2212 2s frequency [90]. By comparing the two frequencies, it was possible to detect a\ndrift of the standard used and to reduce the absolute uncertainty to 150 Hz for the isotopic shift, while\nfor hydrogen this was 850 Hz. The absolute measurement in the indium ion (5S \u2212 5P0 transition) now\ngives [88] 1 267 402 452 914(41) kHz (uncertainty is 3.2 * 10\u221211 ) and the result is soon to be improved.\n\u2022 Another approach to compare the gross and fine structure may possibly be realized in an atomic system,\nwhere the levels with different n and l lie close each to other. This may be in the case of an accidental\ncancellation of the Ry and \u03b12 Ry terms. An example of such a cancellation can be seen in the spectrum\nof the Ag atom. Two excited multiplets, 4d10 5p and 4d9 5s2 (one of the 4d9 5s2 lines is quite narrow \u223c 1\nHz), are split slightly. The splitting comes from the gross structure.

For such\na cancellation, a value of energy splitting between levels from different multiplets is quite sensitive to a\nvariation of \u03b1. Measuring the splitting with relatively low accuracy, it is possible to reach a strong limit.\nA similar idea for the 4f 10 5d6s \u2212 4f 9 5d2 6s lines in the Dy atom was proposed in Ref. [51, 52]. In some\nsense, the search for the accidental degeneration is quite close to approaches using nuclear data, in which\nthe smallness of some differences is widely utilized (see e. g. Ref. [24]).\nLet us discuss conditions needed for success in such an experiment. We consider the spectrum of the Ag\natom as an example and some properties of low-lying levels in that atom are presented in Fig. 4 and Table\n10.\nThe conditions for a precise measurement of a transition sensitive to possible variations of the constants\nare:\n\u2013 The fine structure terms should be of the same order of magnitude as the gross structure contributions.\nIn the silver ion this is true: the splitting of the two 5p2 PJ0 levels is about the same value as the\n0\nseparation between one of them (5p2 P3/2\n) and one of the 4d9 5s22 DJ levels (4d9 5s22 D5/2 ). The other\nfine structure splitting (between D levels) is larger than the P \u2212 D interval.\n\u2013 The non-relativistic (Ry) and relativistic terms \u03b12 Ry have to have a different sign. This is very\nlikely because of the sandwich sequence of levels P \u2212 D \u2212 P \u2212 D with the center of gravity of the\nD level lying above that for the P states. That means that the non-relativistic contribution for the\nD states is likely higher than for the P states. As far as we are interested in the lower D level, we\n17\n\n\f4.50.104\n4.00.104\n6p7s 3 P1 0 (\u03c4 = 6 ns)\n\nEnergy of levels [cm-1]\n\n3.50.104\n\n6p7s 3 P0 0\n6p2 1 S0\n\n3.00.104\n2.50.104\n\n\u03bb = 0.406 \u03bcm\n\n\u03bb = 0.283 \u03bcm\n6p2 1 D2\n\n2.00.104\n1.50.104\n6p2 3 P2 (\u03c4 = 2.6 s)\n\n1.00.104\n\n6p2 3 P1\n5.00.103\n\u03bb = 1.878 \u03bcm\n6p2 3 P0\n\n0.00.100\n\nFigure 3: The energy levels and a scheme of the experiment on the fine structure of neutral lead.\ncan expect that the relativistic contribution to that is negative. Indeed, if silver qualified for other\nconditions it would be studied theoretically before performing the experiment. The relativistic effects\nshift and split levels. We can estimate an enhancement of the sensitivity assuming that there are no\nshifts, but only splittings. We expect this should work for a preliminary estimation. In such a case\na non-relativistic correction can be found from the separation of the centers of gravitation of the P\nand D lines:\n0\n\u2206NR (2 P1/2\n\u2212 2 D5/2 ) = \u221255.89 THz = A Ry ,\n(26)\nwhile the relativistic corrections are obtained from the shift of the energy level from the position of\nthe center of gravity\n0\n\u2206Rel (2 P3/2\n\u2212 2 D5/2 ) = 62.82 THz = B \u03b12 Ry .\n(27)\nThe separation eventually is equal to\n0\n\u2206(2 P3/2\n\u2212 2 D5/2 ) = 62.82 THz \u2212 55.89 THz = 6.93 THz .\n\n(28)\n\nA variation of the Rydberg constant can be neglected and one can find\n\u2202 ln(\u2206/Ry)\nB \u03b12 Ry\n\u22432\n\u2248 2 * 10 .\n\u2202 ln \u03b1\n\u2206\n\n(29)\n\nThe factor 2 is the common factor because any relativistic correction depends on \u03b12 and 10 is an\nestimation of the enhancement due to the accidental degenerations.\n18\n\n\f2D\n\nEnergy from ground state [ THz ]\n\n1050\n\n3/2\n\n1025\n1000\n975\n950\n925\n\n2P\n\n3/2\n\n900\n2D\n\n875\n\n5/2\n\n2P\n1/2\n\nGround state 2S1/2\nFigure 4: Scheme of low-lying levels of the neutral Ag atom. The hyperfine structure is not shown.\n\u2013 For accurate measurement it may be important to use laser cooling. An important conditions for\nthis is lack of the hyperfine structure. Unfortunately both stable isotopes (107 Ag and 109 Ag) have\nsome magnetic moment and the ground state of any stable isotope is usually split into two states.\nThe laser cooling is possible but rather complicated.\n\u2013 It may also be important to apply two-photon Doppler-free excitation to produce one of the two\nlevels, splitting of which contains a cancellation between relativistic and non-relativistic term. This\nis necessary because it is somehow possible to cool the ground state, but not excited states. We have\nto eliminate Doppler effects due to excitation. The D states in the silver atom can be excited by\nmeans of the two-photon transitions.\n\u2013 Both levels have to be narrow. The D level (4d9 5s22 D5/2 ) is very narrow with a width of about 1\nHz, but both P states are very broad.\n\u2013 A precise measurement of the small splitting due to the cancellation must be possible. Generally this\nmeans that one must be to induce a single-photon transition. The one-photon transition between\n0\nstates 4d9 5s22 D5/2 and 5p2 P3/2\nlies at 7 THz. It can be induced but it is hard to measure such a\ntransition frequency precisely.\nOne can see that the conditions can be realized in some atomic systems and it is necessary to search for\nthem. One should note that in the case of ions the condition for choice of nuclear spin is different. It may\nbe more important to have some states that are insensitive to a magnetic field (the whole moment F of a\nsystem of electrons plus nucleus must be integer and states with mF = 0 are alowed).\nOur suggestion is to look for a relatively small enhancement but with an appropriate possibility for precise\nmeasurements. The proposal with Dy in Refs. [51, 52] is rather for a great enhancement without any\naccurate spectroscopy.\n\n5\n\nNuclear magnetic moments and interpretation of the frequency\ncomparisons\n\nA frequency comparison involves atoms that are very differentin nature and one must be prepared to interpret\nresults. Most precise results are for the hfs (see Table 5) and we mainly discuss the hfs transitions.

The hfs is neglected.\n\nany absolute measurements assume a comparison to the cesium hyperfine separation this is also important for\ninterpreting the absolute optical measurements (see Table 6).\n\n5.1\n\nMagnetic moments\n\nTo the leading order the hfs interval can be presented in the form of Eq.(2). There are two different factors\nimportant for the comparison: magnetic moments and the relativistic corrections. The magnetic moments\nand some other nuclear properties are collected in Table 11. Some atoms, hyperfine separation in which was\nmeasured accurately, but less precisely than one part in 1011 , are also included:\n\u2022 \u03bdhfs (43 Ca+ ) = 15 199 862.858(2) kHz [91];\n\u2022 \u03bdhfs (113 Cd+ ) = 3 225 608.286 4(3) kHz [92];\n\u2022 \u03bdhfs (131 Ba+ ) = 9 107 913.699 0(5) kHz [69];\n\u2022 \u03bdhfs (135 Ba+ ) = 7 183 340.234 9(6) kHz [93];\n\u2022 \u03bdhfs (137 Ba+ ) = 8 037 741.667 7(4) kHz [94].\nMost of these are stable, expect cadmium (T1/2 (113 Cd) = 9 * 1015 yr) and the lightest barium (T1/2 (131 Ba) = 12\nd). The sign of the magnetic moment of 131 Ba was presented in Ref. [27] as unknown and we follow Ref. [69].\nA discussion on the value of the nuclear magnetic moments is also important because of our proposal to look\nfor variations of small moments.\nAll nuclei in Table 11 and 7 have an odd value of A, while Z is even for iron, gadolinium, osmium and\ntungsten (Table 7) and calcium, cadmium, barium, ytterbium and mercury (Table 11) and odd for all others.\nAn even value of Z indicates that the nuclear magnetic moment is associated with the neutron magnetic moment\nand in the case of odd Z the moment is due to the proton one. Let us start with small moments. Some of these\ncan be understood using a simple model (the Schmidt model), while assuming that the magnetic moment of\nthe nucleus-like a moment of an electron in a hydrogen-like atom-includes a spin part and an orbital part\n\u03bca (I) = \u03bc I/I = \u03bcsa S + \u03bcla L ,\n20\n\n(30)\n\n\fZ\n\nNucleus\n\nH\nD\n\nNuclear\n\nMagnetic\n\nspin and\n\nmoment\n\nparity\n\n[\u03bcn ]\n\n1/2+\n\n2.793\n\n1\n\n+\n\n0.857\n\nT\n\n1/2\n\n+\n\nBe\n\n3/2\n\n\u2212\n\n-1.178\n-1.318\n\n2.979\n\n4\n\n9\n\n20\n\n43\n\nCa\n\n7/2\n\n\u2212\n\n37\n\n87\n\nRb\n\n3/2\n\n\u2212\n\n2.751\n\n48\n\n113\n\n1/2\n\n+\n\n-0.622\n\n55\n\n133\n\nCs\n\n7/2\n\n+\n\n2.582\n\n56\n\n131\n\nBa\n\n1/2+\n\n-0.708\n\n133\n\nBa\n\n1/2+\n\n-0.772\n\n135\n\nBa\n\n3/2+\n\n0.838\n0.938\n\nCd\n\nBa\n\n3/2\n\n+\n\n171\n\nYb\n\n1/2\n\n\u2212\n\n0.494\n\n173\n\nYb\n\n5/2\n\n\u2212\n\n-0.680\n\n199\n\nHg\n\n1/2\n\n\u2212\n\n0.506\n\n137\n\n70\n80\n\nTable 11: Properties of some nuclei important for precise microwave spectroscopy.\n\nwhere I = S + L, \u03bcsp = 2\u03bcp , \u03bcsn = 2\u03bcn , \u03bclp = \u03bcn and \u03bcln = 0. We should remember that the values of the spin\nterms (\u03bcsa ) originate from dynamic effects of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the strong coupling regime\nand so they sensitive to a variation of the QCD coupling constant (\u03b1s ). The Schmidt model leads to some\nrelatively small values in a few cases:\n\u2022 for odd Z, I = 1/2, L = 1, in particular, N, Y, Rh and Ag in Table 7 (a cancellation between spin and\norbit contributions)\n4 \u2212 gp\n\u03bc=\n\u03bcn \u223c \u22120.26 \u03bcn ,\n(31)\n6\nwhere gp = 2 * 2.793 . . .;\n\u2022 for odd Z, I = 3/2, L = 2, particularly, K, Ir and Au in Table 7 (a cancellation between spin and orbit\ncontributions):\n\u0011\n3 \u0010\n(32)\n6 \u2212 gp \u03bcn \u223c 0.12 \u03bcn ;\n\u03bc=\n10\n\u2022 for even Z, I = 1/2, L = 1, in particular, iron, osmium and tungsten in Table 7, ytterbium\u2013171 and\nmercury in Table 11 and 153\n62 Sm, discussed in Sect. 4.1 (the result is relatively small because of the\ncoefficient 1/3):\ngn\n(33)\n\u03bc = \u2212 \u03bcn \u223c 0.64 \u03bcn ,\n6\nwhere gn = \u22122 * 1.913 . . ..\n\nIn all other cases presented in Tables 11 and 7 the value of the magnetic moment is not smaller than one in\nunits of the nuclear magneton \u03bcn . In some cases the agreement between the Schmidt values and the actual ones\nis a 10% level, but in other cases the actual values are significantly smaller and that is a result of the nuclear\n21\n\n\feffects and, hence, small magnetic moments are sensitive to these. Comparison of Eqs.(31), (32) and (33) shows\nthat the nuclei with odd Z and odd A can be more interesting because the magnetic moment is small partly\ndue to cancellations between the spin and orbit contributions, which are sensitive to variation of gp .\nWe collect the Schmidt values for different nuclear spin\n\u0012\n\u0013\ngs \u2212 gl\n\u03bcs (I = L \u00b1 1/2) = I g l \u00b1\n\u03bcn ,\n(34)\n2l + 1\nwhere g b = \u03bcb /\u03bcn and \u03bcb for a proton and neutron are defined above, in Table 12.\n\nSpin (I) and Schmidt value of the magnetic moment (\u03bcS ) of odd-A nuclei\nl\n\nI = l + 1/2\nI\n\nI = l \u2212 1/2\n\nMagnetic moment [\u03bcn ]\nOdd Z\n\n0\n\n1/2+\n\ngp /2\n\n\u2243 2.793\n\nI\n\nEven Z\ngn /2 \u2243 \u22121.913\n\n-\n\n1\n\n3/2\u2212\n\ngp /2 + 1 \u2243 3.793\n\ngn /2 \u2243 \u22121.913\n\n1/2\u2212\n\n2\n\n5/2+\n\ngp /2 + 2 \u2243 4.793\n\ngn /2 \u2243 \u22121.913\n\n3/2+\n\n3\n\n7/2\u2212\n\ngp /2 + 3 \u2243 5.793\n\ngn /2 \u2243 \u22121.913\n\n5/2\u2212\n\n4\n\n9/2+\n\ngp /2 + 4 \u2243 6.793\n\ngn /2 \u2243 \u22121.913\n\n7/2+\n\nMagnetic moment [\u03bcn ]\nOdd Z\n\nEven Z\n\n-\n\n\u0001\n\n1/3 2 \u2212 gp /2 \u2243 \u22120.264\n\u0001\n3/5 3 \u2212 gp /2 \u2243 0.124\n\u0001\n5/7 4 \u2212 gp /2 \u2243 0.862\n\u0001\n7/9 5 \u2212 gp /2 \u2243 1.717\n\n\u0001\n1/3 \u2212 gn /2 \u2243 0.638\n\u0001\n3/5 \u2212 gn /2 \u2243 1.148\n\u0001\n5/7 \u2212 gn /2 \u2243 1.366\n\u0001\n7/9 \u2212 gn /2 \u2243 1.488\n\nTable 12: Magnetic moment, spin and parity of nuclei in the Schmidt model (Eqs.(30) and (34)).\nComparison of the Schmidt model with the most important isotopes for precision measurements and variations of the constants is presented in Fig. 5. Here we collect the Schmidt values (two lines) and actual\nvalues of the magnetic moments of the isotopes from Table 11 (filled circles), other stable or long-lived isotopes associated with simple atomic spectra of neutral or single-charged ions (open circles), and the isotopes\nfrom Table 7 with small magnetic moments (triangles). One nucleus of this kind (87 Sr, 9/2+ , \u03bc = \u22121.094\u03bcn,\n\u03bcs (9/2+) = \u22121.931\u03bcn)) is not included in the figure because of its large spin.\nFrom the figure one sees that the agreement between real values and the simple Schmidt model is not\nperfect. This means that nature of nuclear spin are more complicated and the effects of nuclear interaction are\nsignificant. However, the model contains some important physics: e. g. the model predicts simple relations\nbetween the nuclear parity and magnetic moment. Only one isotope in Fig. 5 has inconsistent values of the\nparity and spin (169 Tm, 1/2+ , \u03bc = \u22120.23\u03bcn).\nThere is no simple model for even A, when there are two valence particles-a proton and neutron-and a\ncontribution of orbital motion. For deuterium the proton and neutron contributions have different signs (23).\n192\nTwo radionuclides discussed in Sect. 4.1, 198\n81 Tl, 79 Au, have even A.\n\n5.2\n\nRelativistic corrections\n\nNow let us discuss the hfs intervals in Table 5. First, we consider the relativistic corrections, which have been in\npart discussed in Sect 3.2. They can be calculated within using many-body perturbation theory (see e. g. Ref.\n[52]). An approximation of Eqs.(18) and (19) is a good one for alkali atoms (all but ytterbium and mercury in\nTable 5) under the conditions:\n\u2022 High nuclear charge: Z \u226b 1.\n\u2022 Atoms are neutral or slightly charged: Z \u226b z, where z is an effective charge of a compound nucleus for\nthe valentce electron, i. e. z = 1 for neutral atoms and z = 2 for single-charged ones. Note that, Eq.(18)\nis incorrect for hydrogen and its isotopes and for the Li-like ion of beryllium presented in Table 5.\n22\n\n\fa: odd Z\n\nb: even Z\n\n6.5\n\n2.00\n1.50\n\nNuclear magnetic moment \u03bc [\u03bc N]\n\n5.5\n\nI = l - 1/2\n\n4.5\n\n7 Li\n\nT\nH\n\n87 Rb\n\n2.5\n\n133 Cs\n\n23 K\n\n1.5\n\nsmall moments\n\n-0.50 113 Cd\n-1.00\n\n85 Rb\n\n0.5\n\n171 Yb\n\n0.00\n\n137 Cs\n\n133 Ba\n\n111 Cd\n131 Ba\n\n173 Yb\n201 Hg\n25 Mg\n9 Be\n\n-1.50\n\n39 K\n\n67 Zn\n\n135 Ba\n\n199 Hg\n\n0.50\n3.5\n\n137 Ba\n\n1.00\n\nI = l + 1/2\n\n43 Ca\n41 Ca\n\nI = l - 1/2\n-2.00\n\n-0.5\n\n3 He\n\nsmall moments\n1/2\n\n3/2\n\n5/2\n\n-2.50\n\n7/2\n\n172\n\nI = l + 1/2\n3/2\n\n5/2\n\n7/2\n\nNuclear spin I\n\nFigure 5: Magnetic moment of some isotopes: actual values and the Schmidt model. Nuclei with small magnetic\nmoments are listed in Table 7.\n\u2022 Accuracy is expected to be on a 5\u221215% level and a comparison of two atoms with a small charge difference\n(Z1,2 \u226b |Z1 \u2212 Z2 |) will not give accurate results.\nAs already mentioned, due to a discussion on the interpretation of results in Ref. [57], any atom with a closed\nsubshell and one valence electron satisfies the above conditions. Alkali atoms actually form only one example\nof such atomic systems.\nRelativistic corrections are also important for the gross and fine structure. They have a relative order of\n(Z\u03b1)2 . In the simplest case, namely for alkali atoms, they were discussed in Ref. [52], where some results were\nobtained for Ca and Sr+ and in Ref. [95] for In+ . It seems that relativistic effects are less important for the\noptical transitions than for the hfs because of relatively small numerical coefficients and an extra 1/n\u2217 factor.\nIn the hydrogen atom for both hfs and 1s \u2212 2s transitions the corrections are negligible.\n\n5.3\n\nHyperfine structure\n\nThe hfs of atoms with nuclei with even Z and odd A is sensitive to the neutron magnetic moment. In particular\nthe Schmidt model predicts the magnetic moment of mercury and ytterbium\u2013171 (see Eq.(33)) within 15%\nuncertainty. In contrast the hfs of atoms with odd Z and odd A depends on a value of the proton magnetic\nmoment. An important point however is the size of nuclear effects of the strong and electromagnetic interactions.\nThey can be estimated by a deviation from the Schmidt value. In the case of Cs the nuclear effects increase the\nvalue by a factor of about 1.5. This means that any interpretation of comparisons with Cs cannot neglect the\nstrong interactions.\nIn the case of even-to-even or odd-to-odd comparisons, in particular for H\u2013Rb, and Be\u2013Yb\u2013Hg, we expect\nan information on the variation of the constants due to the nuclear effects and the relativistic corrections.\nComparison of odd-to-even hfs yields to variation of gn with respect to gp . This is important, because there\nis no reason to expect that a value of gn /gp is relatively stable, while the constants are varying. Our point of\n23\n\n\fview is different from that in Ref. [57], where the H\u2013Hg+ comparison was examined assuming that a variation\nof the nuclear g-factors can be neglected.\nWe have not mentioned the Cs hfs because here the interpretation is slightly different. Although 133 Cs is an\nisotope with odd Z, its comparison with H or Rb is sensitive to a variation of gp , because the gp contribution\nto the nuclear g factor has a negative sign in contrast to H and Rb. For example, the sensitivity of the H-to-Cs\ncomparison to the gp variation is determined by the value of\n\u2202\n\u03bcs (Cs)\n10\nln\n\u2243 \u22122.3 ,\n=\u2212\n\u2202 ln gp\n\u03bcs (H)\n10 \u2212 gp\n\n(35)\n\nand for the Rb-to-Cs comparison one can find\n\u2202\n\u03bcs (Cs)\n12 gp\n\u0001 \u2243 \u22122.0 .\n\u0001\nln\n=\u2212\n\u2202 ln gp\n\u03bcs (Rb)\n2 + gp 10 \u2212 gp\n\n(36)\n\nIn contrast, the H-to-Rb comparison is actually insensitive to any variations of the proton g-factor:\n\u03bcs (Rb)\n2\n\u2202\nln\n\u2243 \u22120.26 .\n=\u2212\n\u2202 ln gp\n\u03bcs (H)\n2 + gp\n\nMagnetic moment\nAtom\n\nH\nD\n9\n\nBe\n\n87\n\n+\n\nRb\n\n133\n\nCs\n\n171\n\nYb+\n\n199\n\nHg+\n\nNaive (\u03bcs )\n\n(37)\n\nRelativistic\n\nActual (\u03bc)\n\ncorrection\n\nEq. for \u03bcs [\u03bcn ]\n\n[\u03bcn ]\n\n[\u03bcn ]\n\n\u03bc/\u03bcs\n\nF (\u03b1)\n\n\u2202 ln F/\u2202 ln \u03b1\n\ngp /2\n\n2.79\n\n2.79\n\n1.00\n\n1.00\n\n0.00\n\n(gp \u2212 |gn |)/2\n\n0.88\n\n0.86\n\n0.98\n\n1.00\n\n0.00\n\ngn /2\n\n-1.18\n\n-1.91\n\n0.62\n\n1.00\n\n0.00\n\ngp /2 + 1\n\n3.73\n\n2.75\n\n0.74\n\n1.15(10)\n\n0.30(6)\n\n1.72\n\n2.58\n\n1.50\n\n1.39(7)\n\n0.83, [52]\n\n0.64\n\n0.49\n\n0.77\n\n1.78 (9)\n\n1.42(15)\n\n0.64\n\n0.51\n\n0.80\n\n2.26(12)\n\n2.30, [52]\n\n7\n18 (10\n\n\u2212 gp )\n\n\u2212gn /6\n\u2212gn /6\n\nTable 13: Hyperfine structure properties. Relativistic corrections, if not specified, are calculated from Eqs.(18)\nand (19). We estimate the uncertainty for F as 5% and for the derivative as 10% by comparison with Ref. [52].\nIn the case of hydrogen and beryllium, the Casimir correction is not appropriate, but Eqs.(15), (16) and (17)\nlead to negligible shifts.\nWe summarize some properties of hfs intervals of some atoms in Table 13. The naive value (\u03bcs ) is the\nSchmidt one ((see Table 12) for any atom, except deuterium. The deuterium naive value is determined from\nEq.(23). It is not quite clear if the Schmidt model works, but we expect it to be appropriate for preliminary\nestimations and we consider deviations from the naive value \u03bc/\u03bcs \u2212 1 as a correction due to nuclear interactions.\nFor Cs, the corrections shift the value by 50% and unsurprisingly that is the largest contribution in Table 13.\nCesium has only one stable isotope and this indicates that the nuclear configuration is not strongly bounded\nand so different nuclear core polarization effects or an admixture of excited states can be significant. We have\nincluded the beryllium ion in the Table mainly due to the measurement [81] in the magnetic field. In the\nleading non-relativistic approximation this value is proportional to the hfs interval at zero field. The relativistic\ncorrections are different, but they are small enough.\nRelativistic corrections are calculated using Casimir approach of Eqs.(18) and (19), except for derivatives\nfor Cs and Hg, taken from Ref. [52]. One reason, why derivatives are relatively large is that the function F\nis always a function of \u03b12 . However, one can expect the same for the strong interactions. One can see that\n24\n\n\fthe relativistic corrections for alkali atoms are of the same sign and it must be a partial cancellation for the\ncomparison of two different hfs. In contrast, the nuclear effects shift a value of the nuclear magnetic moment\nin different directions for different atoms and an enhancement (e. g. for the Rb\u2013Cs hfs) is possible. We can\nhowever hope that for a representative enough set of atoms they can be considered rather as statistical errors.\nClearly if we would like to have a clear interpretation of some frequency comparisons, we have to choose one\nof two options:\n\u2022 We can measure only the gross and fine structure with understandable relativistic effects and reach a limit\nfor the variation of \u03b1.\n\u2022 We can involve the hfs in the comparison. In this case we must be able to estimate nuclear effects and their\nvariations. The magnetic moment can be close to the Schmidt value accidently due to some cancellation\nof contributions with different nature and it can be quite sensitive to the variations of the constants. So it\nis necessary to have small and understandable corrections due to the nuclear effects. It is also necessary to\ndo a few comparisons in order to be able to transform variations of the frequencies to variations of \u03b1, gp ,\ngn and \u03bcn /\u03bcb . One should emphasize a significant difference between the study of atoms with odd A and\neither odd or even Z. The even Z nuclear magnetic moments are mainly proportional to the same value\n(gn ), which can be corrected by nuclear effects. A comparison between two even Z hfs is insensitive to\nany variations gn . Conversely investigation of only odd Z atoms should provide enough information on gp\nbecause they contain spin and orbit contributions which diferently depend on nuclear quantum numbers\n(L, S and J).\nIn principle, there is one more option search available. One can look for two isotopes (with odd Z and odd\nA, but different nuclear spins or parity) of one element with magnetic moments close to their Schmidt values.\nThe ratio of the hfs intervals should be free off any relativistic and many-body atomic corrections and could be\nnot too sensitive to nuclear effects. In this case the ratio of the hfs should be close to a ratio of their respective\nSchmidt values, i. e. a simple function of gp . Unfortunately we have been not able to find an appropriate pair\nof the isotopes for this study.\n\n5.4\n\nTime structure of the measurements\n\nWe should point out a timing problem in the absolute frequency measurements. Some results have been obtained\nvia a direct comparison to the primary cesium clock, i. e. directly compared to the Cs hfs. Others have been\ncompared indirectly and the \"time structure\" of such an experiment can be quite complicated and includes some\nintermediate steps with comparisons between different secondary standards. An example is a measurement of\nthe 2s\u2212 8s and 2s\u2212 8d transitions in hydrogen and deuterium atoms by the Paris group. The measurements [96]\ninvolved a comparison in 1997 of the hydrogen and deuterium lines with some secondary standard, gauged in\n1985 [97]. The standard was recalibrated in 1999 [98]. Such a time structure is reasonable for a determination\nof the Rydberg constant and the hydrogen Lamb shift, but it is not appropriate to search for a variation of\nthe constants. In Tables 5 and 6 we assume that publication time is the time for a direct comparison with a\nprimary Cs standard. For the hydrogen and deuterium hyperfine structure that is approximately correct. In\nsome cases that is not so.\nThe other time structure problem is in a comparison with secondary standards, like a hydrogen maser.\nSome preliminary studies estimated possible deviations of its frequency with respect to some known standards\nor with respect to some average value of an ensemble of masers. In both case it is not clear how to interpret\nany comparison with a specific maser at some particular time.\n\n6\n6.1\n\nThe hyperfine separation in the hydrogen atom\nHistorical remarks\n\nThe hydrogen hfs was studied for a few generations of experiments. The first results with an accuracy of\nabout 1012 were reached about 35 years ago and some of them are presented in Table 14. Most experiments\n[99, 100, 101, 102] were devoted to a measurement of the maser frequency, while previously measured value for\nthe wall-shift using another maser in Ref. [112] was accepted. In Ref. [101] no explicit value of uncertainty was\nclaimed. From discussions in that paper we estimate it as 3 * 10\u221212 for the NRC cesium standard and 1.7 * 10\u221212\nfor the maser.\n25\n\n\fFrequency (\u03bd)\n\nRef. to\n\nYear\n\n[kHz]\n\nfrequency\n\n1 420 405.751 786(2)\n\n[99], 1966\n\n1965\n\n1 420 405.751 756(3)\n\n[100], 1968\n\n1966\n\n1 420 405.751 758(2)\n\n[100], 1969\n\n1967\n\n1 420 405.751 776(5)\n\n[101], 1968\n\n1968\n\n1 420 405.751 777(3)\n\n[102], 1970\n\n1968\n\nRelative\n\nRef. to\n\nuncertainty\n\nwall-shift\n\n1.4 * 10\u221212\n\n[103]\n\n2.1 * 10\n\n\u221212\n\n[103]\n\n1.4 * 10\n\n\u221212\n\n[103]\n\n3.5 * 10\n\n\u221212\n\n[103]\n\n2.1 * 10\n\n\u221212\n\n[103]\n\nTable 14: Some early precise measurements of the hydrogen hyperfine separation. The references are given with\nthe year of publication, while the year of the experiment is given additionally.\n\nOne of the first really accurate experiments was performed by NBS [104] and in part by Harvard University\nteam [105]. It was pointed out [104] that the wall-shift and the frequency have to be determined in the\nexperiments for the same masers. This generation of experiments [106, 104, 105, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112]\nis discussed in the next section. When we speak about two generations we refer to an ideology, rather than to\na time-frame. Some other experiments [115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120] performed in that time or slightly earlier\nwere not so precise (see Fig. 6). Let us mention Ref. [115] wherein an experiment that measured both the\nfrequency and the wall-shift was described. However, only two bulbs were used. As was noted in Ref. [104]\nanother important condition for appropriate results is the use of a large number of bulbs of different size (e. g.\nin Ref. [104] 11 bulbs were and in Ref. [105] the number was 18).\n\nFrequency \u03bd HFS - 1 420 405 751 Hz\n\n0.850 Hz\n\n0.825 Hz\n\n0.800 Hz\n\n0.775 Hz\n\n0.750 Hz\n\n0.725 Hz\n\n1960\n\n1970\n\n1980\n\nTime of measurement\n\nFigure 6: Precise experimental results on the hydrogen hyperfine separation.

That was due to a trial to use the hydrogen\nmaser as a primary frequency standard. The results are collected in Table 15. Until the publication of results\nEq.(21) of experiment on the hfs of the beryllium ion fifteen years ago [81], the value of the hyperfine separation\nin the hydrogen atom had been the most precisely measured physical quantity.\n\n#\n\nFrequency (\u03bd)\n\nRef.\n\nYear\n\nRelative\n\n[kHz]\n\nCs standard\n\nComment\n\nuncertainty\n\n1\n\n1 420 405.751 778(4)\n\n[106], 1969\n\n1969\n\n2\n\n1 420 405.751 769(2)\n\n[104], 1970\n\n1969\u20131970\n\n3\n\n1 420 405.751 767(2)\n\n[104], 1970\n\n1969\u20131970\n\n4\n\n1 420 405.751 768(2)\n\n[104], 1970\n\n1969\u20131970\n\n5\n\n1 420 405.751 767(1)\n\n[107], 1971\n\n1970\n\n6\n\n1 420 405.751 770(3)\n\n[108], 1971\n\n1970\u20131971\n\n7\n\n1 420 405.751 767(3)\n\n[109], 1973\n\n1970\n\n8\n\n1 420 405.751 768(2)\n\n[110], 1974\n\n1974\n\n9\n\n1 420 405.751 770(3)\n\n[111], 1974\n\n1972\n\n10\n\n1 420 405.751 771(6)\n\n[112], 1978\n\n1975\u20131976\n\n11\n\n1 420 405.751 768(2)\n\n[113], 1980\n\n1979\n\n12\n\n1 420 405.751 768(3)\n\n[113], 1980\n\n1979\n\n13\n\n1 420 405.751 773(1)\n\n[114], 1980\n\n1978\n\n28 * 10\u221213\n\nLSRH commerc.\n\n2 bulbs\n\n14 * 10\n\n\u221213\n\nNBS primary\n\nExp. 1, 12 bulbs [105]\n\n\u221213\n\nNBS primary\n\nExp. 2, 18 bulbs\n\n14 * 10\n\n\u221213\n\nNBS primary\n\nExp. 1 & 2\n\n\u221213\n\nNPL primary\n\n6 bulbs\n\n21 * 10\n\n\u221213\n\nNRC primary\n\n5 bulbs\n\n21 * 10\u221213\n\nNPL primary\n\n6 bulbs\n\n14 * 10\n\n7.0 * 10\n\n14 * 10\u221213\n\nLORAN C, USNO\n\nFlexible bulb\n\n21 * 10\n\n\u221213\n\nTOP, TAF\n\nWall-shift [105]\n\n41 * 10\n\n\u221213\n\nLORAN C\n\n6 bulbs\n\n14 * 10\n\n\u221213\n\nLORAN C\n\n5 bulbs\n\n21 * 10\n\n\u221213\n\nLORAN C\n\n5 bulbs\n\n\u221213\n\nTAF\n\nFlexible bulb,\n\n7 * 10\n\nzero wall-shift\n\nTable 15: The most precise measurements of the hydrogen hyperfine structure interval.

S. Naval Observatory, TOP-cesium clock from the Paris Observatory, TAF-the French atomic\ntime.\nThe experiments were performed using hydrogen masers and two key values were measured simultaneously:\nthe frequency of the maser and the wall-shift. Result #9 is an exception: the authors utilized a value of the\nwall-shift from Ref. [105]. Result #5 of Ref. [107] with the smallest uncertainty was actually a preliminary\npresentation. The final value of the NPL experiment (result #5) had an accuracy [109] three times lower.\nOne of the papers contains a report on two independent measurements [104], quoted as experiment 1 and\nexperiment 2, and we give both results in the table, as well as an average value presented by the authors of\nRef. [104]. Experiment 2 is a pure NBS experiment. In experiment 1 the maser frequency of a maser from\nHarvard university was measured with respect to the NBS primary cesium standard [104], while the wall-shift\nof the same maser was measured by the Harvard people [105]. The same result for the wall-shift [105] was\naccepted by the authors of Ref. [111] for another maser, the frequency of which they measured. Values #11\nand #12 were presented in Ref. [113]. That paper is devoted to a measurement of the wall-shift and the\nunperturbed maser frequency (result #11) at the Shanghai Bureau of Metrology. It also contains a reference\nto an unpublished result (#12) for the unperturbed hydrogen frequency of two hydrogen maser by the Shaanxi\nAsrtonomical Observatory. In this two bulbs from the SBM were used. The last result in Table (# 13) is based\non a different idea. Authors studied the temperature dependence of the wall-shift and they found the the shift\n27\n\n\fvanished at some temperature T0 . The hfs interval was afterwards determined from a maser frequency at T0 .\nThe value in Table 5 (Eq.(22)) calculated by Ramsey [64] is an average of results #4 and #5, and so cannot\nbe actually accepted. However, the results in Table 15 are consistent (apart from the earliest one) and one can\ncalculate some average values. For instance the average values can be calculated over results ##1\u20133, 6\u201313 (a\nwide set) or over ##4, 6, 7, 10 and 11 (a conservative set). The wide set includes all original results, while\nthe conservative one contains only values published in refereed journals. We consider results #1 and #7 as\npreliminary and also exclude result #8 because the wall-shift and the frequency werenot measured during the\nsame experiment.\nAs a preliminary estimation, one can assume that the uncertainties are independent and one finds:\n\u03bdwide = 1 420 405.751 770 4(6) kHz\n\n(38)\n\n\u03bdcons = 1 420 405.751 768 3(12) kHz .\n\n(39)\n\nand\nThe fractional uncertainty of the average value is (4\u20139)*10\u221213 and that is approximately as in Table 5. In fact\nthere has to be some correlation between the systematic errors. However since most of the results are consistent,\nany averaging cannot yield a value that is less precise than one of the results, namely\n\u03bd(#4) = 1420 405.751 768(2) kHz .\n\n(40)\n\nWe think this result should be used for comparisons because it is the most accurate and reliable result in Table\n15. Result #4 was published in a refereed journal [104] (in contrast to result #8 [110]) and it was based on two\nindependent measurements of the unperturbated hydrogen hfs frequency with respect to the NBS primary Cs\nstandard. The largest number of bulbs was used to determine the wall-shift using two independent experiments\n[105, 104]. The result is in fair agreement with other results in Table 15, apart from results #1 and # 13. The\ndiscrepancy with the former is not important, because result #1 does not agree with others on a one-sigma\nlevel, but rather within three sigma. We also should mention that Ref. [108] refers to a private communication\nby one of the authors of Ref. [106] (Menoud, 1971) wherein a new LSRH value of hydrogen hfs\n\u03bd(LSRH ) = 1 420 405.751 764(10) kHz ,\n\n(41)\n\nis quoted. This is less precise than result #1 but agrees with other results. Two results in Table 15 are more\nprecise than the value in Eq.(40). One of them (# 5) [107] was later corrected by the authors [109]. The other\n(result # 13) was obtained using very different methods. We do not include it in the conservative set since it is\ninconsistent with most other results of this set. To conclude, we present in Fig. 7 an overview of experiments\ndone about 30 years ago. Most experimental results measured the wall-shift together with the frequency. Some\ndetails on the crucial results can be found in the Appendix.\nOne should note that 30 years ago the accuracy of the primary cesium standards was not so high as now and\nthis was an important source of uncertainty. The results in Table 15 are presented together with the name of the\nprimary cesium standard used. We expect that it is possible to study variations of those standards which were\nfrequently discussed due to international comparisons. We also expect that the reference set for comparison\nwith experiments possible in the year 2000 will to be between the conservative and wide ones. Particularly, the\nmain sources of uncertainty in experiments 1 and 2 in Ref. [104] are, in part, independent.\n\n6.3\n\nWhy it is important to do experiment with hydrogen now\n\nThe hydrogen atom can now be used in the search for a limit for the variations of fundamental constants on\na level that is comparable with most other possible projects. If the Paris group have really reached a level of\naccuracy (\u03b4\u03bd/\u03bd \u2243 2.4 * 10\u221215 ) reported [121] as a preliminary result\n\u03bdhfs (87 Rb) = 6 834 682.610 904 333(17) kHz ,\n\n(42)\n\nthen only the work on the Rb clock and the Rb hfs can provide a significantly more precise test for the variations.\nUsually, it takes some time to really remove all sources of systematic errors after the first announcement of a\nperformed measurement with a significantly better accuracy. The ratio of Rb and Cs hfs may also be less\nsensitive to the variations, and therefore it is not enough to compare two hfs transitions only. It is necessary to\nhave several different data sets.\nIn any case, the study of the hydrogen hfs has a number of advantages, as are listed below:\n28\n\n\fFrequency \u03bd HFS - 1 420 405 751 Hz\n\n0.780 Hz\n\n0.775 Hz\n\n?\n?\n\n0.770 Hz\n\n0.765 Hz\n\n0.760 Hz\n\n0.755 Hz\n1970\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\nTime of measurement\n\nFigure 7: Hydrogen hyperfine structure as measured thirty years ago. Result with measurement of the wall-shift\nand the frequency for the same masers. Open circles are for preliminary results (conference proceedings, private\ncommunications) and results, corrected after publications. Full circles are for the final results. The question\nmarks are for the possible 2000 measurements.\n\u2022 This is the only accurate comparison over a long interval (30 yr). Only the 171 Yb+ hfs and the 9 Be+ in\nthe magnetic field (with a shorter time separation) is comparable to this. The other results obtained five\nor more years ago cannot provide a search for a variation of the constants on a level below 10\u221213 yr\u22121 .\n\u2022 The result was obtained 30 years ago independently in a few different laboratories (see Table 15) after\nlong studies over a number of years. Only ytterbium\u2013171 was measured in two laboratories, whereas other\ntransitions from Tables 5 and 6 have been studied in only one place for each atom.\n\u2022 Most of the measurements of the hydrogen hfs were performed by direct comparisons with primary Cs\nclocks and thus they have simple time structures.\n\u2022 Nowadays, this measurement can be also done in a number of laboratories.\n\u2022 There is no direct problem due to the accuracy of any primary frequency standard because of the relatively\nlow accuracy needed for the measurement.\n\u2022 The measurement should be as precise as possible. If a level better than 10\u221214 is achieved, a repetition in\na few years can yield another strict limit for the variation of the constant. Thus the measurement in the\nyear 2000 can be the \"second\" measurement of a 30-years test and the \"first\" measurement of a few-years\ntest of the variation.\n\u2022 Combining the variation of the H\u2013Cs hfs with a variation of 1s \u2212 2s in the hydrogen atom with respect to\nthe Cs hfs, one can achieve an estimation for a variation of the hydrogen hfs with respect to the Rydberg\nconstant. The former limit is going to be about (2 \u2212 5) * 10\u221214 yr\u22121 . The accuracy of a determination\nof the 1s \u2212 2s frequency in the hydrogen atom with respect to the Cs hfs has been improved and the\nuncertainty in 1999 [122] is about 6 * 10\u221214 yr\u22121 . This indirect comparison between the hfs and the 1s \u2212 2s\nfrequency in hydrogen can be interpreted without any difficulties arising from the relativistic corrections\nor unclear nuclear effects. Only properties of fundamental particles are to be compared: \u03b1 and \u03bcp /\u03bcb .\nThe hydrogen experiment must have systematic errors, which are quite different from the short-term comparisons. The value of \u03bcp is on for the simplest for interpreting. The result can be reproduced in different laboratories. The expected limit for the variation of the hydrogen hfs lies between 2 * 10\u221214 yr\u22121 and\n29\n\n\f5 * 10\u221214 yr\u22121 . This depends on the possibility of averaging the values from Table 15. Some additional analysis of the old data [106, 104, 108, 109, 110, 111, 105, 112] is needed. This would include the more recent\ndata of international comparisons on the national primary standards utilized in the hydrogen experiments\n[106, 104, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112]. In 2000 only the Rb hfs can provide a significantly better result. From published values, we estimate the limits from possible experiments to approximately 1.3 * 10\u221214 yr\u22121 (for Rb) and\n1.1 * 10\u221214 yr\u22121 (for Hg+ ). The latter is different from that presented in Table 5 because we expect significant\ncorrelations between the uncertainties of the original measurement and the repetition.\n\n7\n\nConclusions\n\nThe strongest published limits (better than 10\u221216 yr\u22121 ) on the variation of fundamental constants arise from\ngeophysical data. However, any direct use of such estimations is not possible because of a incorrect interpretation\nof the data. The best astrophysical data gives limits between 10\u221214 and 10\u221215 yr\u22121 and they are only slightly\nbetter than laboratory limits. Cosmological methods (such as investigation of nucleosynthesis and microwave\nbackground radiation) are far less precise, but they may be important if the variations at the beginning of the\nevolution of the universe were faster. The clock comparisons lead to limit on a level between 10\u221213 and 10\u221214\nyr\u22121 , although, their interpretation is not quite clear. We summarize the different methods used to search for\nthe variations in Table 16. The data contain the amplitude and velocity of the variations and the time and\nspace separations where appropriate. The scale of the space variations due to geochemical studies is estimated\nfrom the absolute motion of the Earth (i. e. a motion with respect to the frame of the microwave background\nradiation frame).\n\nMethod\n\n\u2206 ln \u03b1/\u2206t\n\n\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1\n\n\u2206t\n\n\u2206l/c\n\nGeochemical (Oklo)\n\n10\u221217 yr\u22121\n\n10\u22128\n\n106 yr\n\nAstrophysical\n\n10\u221215 yr\u22121\n\n10\u22125\n\n2 * 109 yr\n\nCosmological\n\n10\u221213 yr\u22121\n\n10\u22123\n\nLaboratory\n\n10\u221214 yr\u22121\n\n10\u221214\n\n1 yr\n\nH/Cs hfs\n\n(2 \u2212 5) * 10\u221214 yr\u22121\n\n(6 \u2212 15) * 10\u221213\n\n30 yr\n\n109 \u2212 1010 yr\n1010 yr\n\n109 \u2212 1010 yr\n1010 yr\n\nTable 16: Comparison of different search for the variations.\nWe believe that the most reliable limits can be reached under laboratory conditions by comparing two results\nfor the same transition, each result obtained in different time. In 2000, there are a number of possibilities to\nreach results a limit of a few units of 10\u221214 yr\u22121 . The most secure one will be that involving the hydrogen\nhyperfine splitting. The limit for a possible variation of the ratio of \u03bcCs /\u03bcp is expected to be about (1\u22122)*10\u221214\nyr\u22121 . The \u03b1-variation due to the relativistic corrections is to be limited by (2 \u2212 5) * 10\u221214 yr\u22121 . The ytterbium\nlimit for the variation of gn /gp is expected to be 6.5 * 10\u221214 yr\u22121 . We need to mention, that the preliminary\nresults on the second ytterbium experiment were in fact published in 1995, but these were later corrected [71].\nA significant part of the measurements was performed by the end of 1995, while the remainder was done in\nmid 1996. If we accept that the experiment was done in 1995, the potential limit is 4 * 10\u221214 yr\u22121 . For the\ndeuterium hfs, if we assume a variation of gp only, the limit is about 5.5 * 10\u221214 yr\u22121 , whereas if we only consider\ngn -variations it is 8.1 * 10\u221214 yr\u22121 . The motivation to study the deuterium hfs is that it is the only value is\nsensitive to gp \u2212 |gn |, amongst those known for a while in Table 5.\nIn Table 16 one can note that the astrophysical, cosmological and geochemical data are not quite sensitive\nto any fluctuations of the constants in T \u223c 108 yr and/or L \u223c c * 108 yr. Astrophysical data yield good limits\nfor the value of \u2206 ln \u03b1/\u2206z, but any interpretation of the redshift z in terms of the time separation such as e. g.\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n,\n(43)\n\u2206t = t0 1 \u2212\n(1 + z)3/2\nwhere t0 = 1.5 * 1010 yr, is actually only an estimation. It is known that the Hubble velocity-distance law is\nnot a strong one and this means that for any particular case, there is no well-established connection between\n30\n\n\fthe redshift (associated with the velocity) and the time t(z) (associated with the distance). This also means\nthat would even be hard to detect a fluctuation with T \u2264 109 yr. Since the interpretation is actually based\non a lack of such fluctuations the astrophysical and geochemical limits are actually weaker than presented in\nthe table. Another problem is the correlation between space and time variations. If we suppose e. g. that the\nconstants increase with time and distance, we have to expect a significant cancellation between the time and\nspace variations (actually we only study some distant objects from the past at a distance \u2206l = c \u2206t). Thence\nthe astrophysical data can be insensitive to some of thse correlations. It must also be mentioned that some\nparticular astrophysical data rather indicate in existence of some variations of the constants. E. g. a few points\nin Fig. 1 of Ref. [50] confirm a variation in \u03b1. However, there are a lot of data points plotted and, statistically,\nperhaps those few are not important. nevertheless, the fit assumes that there is only a slow drift in time and\nthat there are neither space variations and nor fluctuations on a scale shorter than 1010 yr. We think these\npoints need to be re-examined in order to understand if the effect is purely statistical.\nIn contrast to examinations of the astrophysical and geochemical data, a laboratory experiment can determine the derivatives of the constants and is also sensitive to the fluctuations. There should also be no\ncancellation between space and time deviations: no space variation is involved because of the small absolute\nvelocity of Earth.\nThere are four basic dimensionless constants which determine any atomic spectra (in unit of Ry): \u03b1, me /mp ,\ngp and gn . When the frequency is measured in units of the Rydberg constant, the nuclear magnetic moment\ncomes in units of the Bohr magneton \u03bcb . Some of these constants enter into the equations for the energy levels\nwith nuclear magnetic moments constructed of the proton spin contribution \u03bcp = gp me /mp \u03bcb , the neutron\n(spin) contribution \u03bcn = gn me /mp \u03bcb and the proton orbital contribution me /mp \u03bcb . The last combination\ncan also appear as a Dirac part of the proton spin contribution for relativistic corrections. These are known to\nsplit the Dirac part and the anomalous part of the magnetic moment. This simple, four-constant description is\nperturbed by nuclear effects.\nWe would also like to underline that there are two kinds of searches for the variations. One is for clear\ninterpretation and it involves transitions without the influence of nuclear effects or with only a small influence.\nThis is valid for secure limits on the possible variations of the constants. The other kind involves studying\ntransitions which may be expected to be extremely sensitive to some variations, but for which there in no\nclear interpretation. Particularly, the search for sensitive values includes some geochemical study (positions of\nlow-lying resonances) and some laboratory investigations.\nAstrophysical studies are appropriate in the search for variations of \u03b1, me /mp and gp . The limits for gn\ncannot be obtained from astrophysics. If nuclear effects for some magnetic moments calculated, the laboratory\ninvestigation can give some limits for a variation of me /mp and gn . A precision laboratory study of transitions\nwhich are not perturbed by nuclear effects, can give a limit for the fine structure constant and for the ratio\ngp me /mp \u03bcn . The neutron magnetic moment cannot be studied successfully in this way, because of the relatively\nlow accuracy of the deutron hfs and the influence of the nuclear effects on most magnetic moments of heavier\nnuclei. The proton magnetic moment can only be investigated by using the hfs of atomic hydrogen, otherwise\nthe nuclear effects are involved. We hope that a measurement of the hyperfine separation in the hydrogen atom\nwill be performed and that a reliable limit on the possible variation of the fundamental constant will be reached.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe idea of studying the fine structure in order to search for a variation of the fine structure constant was learnt\nby me from Klaus Jungmann [87] and all related possibilities arise from discussions with him. Opportunity,\nprovided with the hydrogen hyperfine structure have been frequently discussed with Ted H\u00e4nsch. Possibilities\nof studying the fine structure of different neutral atoms were discussed with Martin Weitz, while for ions the\nproblem was discussed with Ekkehard Peik. I was happy to learn from them that some search for the fine\nstructure associated with the ground state suggested in the paper can be really performed. I am very grateful\nto all of them.

The wall-shift was\nmeasured in early 1969 [105] and the frequency at the end of 1969.\n\u2013 The result is 1 420 405.751 769 1(24) kHz. Three sources of uncertainty were considered important.\n\u2013 The most significant of these is the wall-shift, because the properties of the bulb could vary with\ntime: \u03b4 = 1.9 * 10\u22126 kHz.\n\u2013 The accuracy capability of the NBS cesium standard gave \u03b4 = 0.7 * 10\u22126 kHz.\n\n\u2013 The frequency dispersion of the standard since it was calibrated was obtained as \u03b4 = 1.3 * 10\u22126 kHz.\n\n\u2022 Value #3 (another result from the same paper [104]) had a different budget of errors. This is a pure NBS\nexperiment, with simultaneous measurements of the wall-shift and the frequency.\n\u2013 The result for the frequency was found to be 1 420 405.751 766 7(18) kHz. The uncertainty due to\nthe cesium standard was the same:\n\u2013 the accuracy capability of the standard led to \u03b4 = 0.7 * 10\u22126 kHz;\n\n\u2013 The frequency dispersion since the calibration was \u03b4 = 1.3 * 10\u22126 kHz.\n\n\u2013 The largest contribution to the uncertainty other than those mentioned was due to a comparison of\nthe maser to the cesium standard: \u03b4 = 1.0 * 10\u22126 kHz.\n\u2022 Value #6 [108] was an NRC experiment.\n\u2013 The result was 1 420 405.751 770(3) kHz.\n\u2013 The uncertainty of the comparison properly was only \u03b4 = 0.7 * 10\u22126 kHz.\n\n\u2013 The variation of the maser frequency during the experiment led to \u03b4 = 2.1 * 10\u22127 kHz.\n\u2013 The instability of the cesium standard frequency gave \u03b4 = 1.4 * 10\u22126 kHz.\n\n\u2022 An NPL experimental result (#5) has been frequently quoted as the most precise one [107]. However, the\nfinal NPL value (#7) has not been the best one.\n\u2013 The result is 1 420 405.751 766 2(30) kHz and there are three sources of uncertainties.\n\u2013 The measurement itself gave a statistical error \u03b4 = 1.4 * 10\u22126 kHz.\n\n\u2013 The accuracy of the cesium standard itself gave \u03b4 = 1.4 * 10\u22126 kHz.\n\n\u2013 Due to the same problem a comparison of the NPL cesium standard with the international time\ncannot be perfect and the uncertainty was \u03b4 = 1.4 * 10\u22126 kHz.\n\u2022 The result (#8) of an experiment in Ref. [110] has been never published in a refereed journal to the best\nof our knowledge, so we cannot consider this as a final result. However, it is important because they used\na very different approach. In contrast to the other experiments the wall-shift was measured by using of a\nflexible bulb.\n\u2013 The result was found to be 1 420 405.751 768 0(20) kHz.\n\u2013 The maser uncertainty was \u03b4 = 1.4 * 10\u22126 kHz.\n\n\u2013 The comparison itself was a little more accurate: \u03b4 = 1.2 * 10\u22126 kHz.\n\n\u2013 The uncertainty due to the wall-shift was estimated as \u03b4 = 0.4 * 10\u22126 kHz.\n\u2022 Result #11 (1 420 405.751 768(2) kHz) is an average over 5 hydrogen masers with a dispersion of their\nfrequencies between 1 420 405.751 765 9(17) kHz and 1 420 405.751 769 3(16) kHz. The budgets of errors\nfor particular masers have not been presented.\n32\n\n\f\u2022 Result #13 (1 420 405.751 773(1) kHz) is not in fair agreement with most other precise values. The\nmethod was also quite different from others as well. First, a new maser was a developed using a flexible\nbulb. Next, the dependence of the wall-shift on the temperature was studied and it was found that the\nwall-shift vanished at a temperature T0 . The result was found by interpolating the maser frequency to T0 .\n\u2022 We do not consider result #10 (1 420 405.751 771(6) kHz) in detail, because the accuracy is slightly\nlower than for forementioned results and the statistical weight for any evaluations is small enough. The\nuncertainty of a measured value of 1 420 405.751 771 0(58) kHz was mainly due to the comparisons of the\nmaser frequency to the local rubidium standard and the standard to the international time scale.\n\n33\n\n\fReferences\n[1] P.
