A proper understanding of SF and the mechanisms regulating it are necessary to reliably predict galaxy evolution. In\nrecent years there has been a growing interest in modeling SF\nwith sub-grid physics in cosmological scenarios, in which an\naccurate description of the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies is needed (e.g. Springel & Hernquist 2003; Schaye 2004;\nDutton et al. 2010; Narayanan et al. 2009; Schaye et al. 2010;\nCook et al. 2010; Lagos et al. 2011; Fu et al. 2010).\nIt has been shown observationally that SF takes place in\nmolecular clouds (see Solomon & Vanden Bout 2005 for a review).\nMoreover, the surface density of the star formation rate (SFR)\ncorrelates with the surface density of molecular hydrogen, H2 , in\nan approximately linear fashion, \u03a3SFR \u221d \u03a3H2 (e.g. Bigiel et al.\n2008; Schruba et al. 2010). On the other hand, the correlation\nbetween \u03a3SFR and the surface density of atomic hydrogen, HI,\n\nis much weaker. Low SFRs have been measured in low stellar\nmass, HI-dominated dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies (e.g.\nRoychowdhury et al. 2009; Wyder et al. 2009), and larger SFRs in\nmore massive galaxies with more abundant H2 , such as normal\nspiral and starburst galaxies (e.g. Kennicutt 1998; Wong & Blitz\n2002).\nObservational constraints on the HI and H2 content of galaxies are now available for increasingly large samples. For HI, accurate measurements of the 21 cm emission in large surveys of local\ngalaxies have been presented by Zwaan et al. (2005) using the HI\nParkes All-Sky Survey (HIPASS; Meyer et al. 2004) and more recently by Martin et al. (2010) using the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA\nSurvey (ALFALFA; Giovanelli et al. 2005). From these surveys it\nhas been possible to probe the HI mass function (MF) down to HI\nmasses of MHI \u2248 106 M\u2299 and to estimate the global HI mass density at z = 0, \u03a9HI = 3.6 \u2212 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 in units of the present day\ncritical density. These HI selected galaxies are also characterised\nby weaker clustering (e.g. Basilakos et al. 2007; Meyer et al. 2007)\n\n\f2\n\nClaudia del P. Lagos\n\nthan optically selected samples (e.g. Norberg et al. 2001), indicating that local HI selected galaxies are preferentially found in lower\nmass haloes than their optical counterparts. At high redshift information about HI is very limited since it is based mostly on\nabsorption-line measurements in the spectra of quasi-stellar object (QSO; e.g. P\u00e9roux et al. 2003; Prochaska et al. 2005; Rao et al.\n2006; Guimar\u00e3es et al. 2009; Noterdaeme et al. 2009; see Rauch\n1998 for a review of this technique). These observations suggest\nvery little evolution of \u03a9HI up to z \u2248 5. Intensity mapping of the\n21 cm emission line is one of the most promising techniques to\nestimate HI mass abundances at high redshifts. This technique has\nrecently been applied to estimate global HI densities at intermediate redshifts (z . 0.8), and has given estimates in agreement\nwith the ones inferred from absorption-line measurements (e.g.\nVerheijen et al. 2007; Lah et al. 2007, 2009; Chang et al. 2010).\nTo study H2 , it is generally necessary to use emission from\nother molecules as tracers, since H2 lacks a dipole moment, making emission from this molecule extremely weak and hard to detect in interstellar gas, which is typically cold. The most commonly\nused proxy for H2 is the 12 CO molecule (hereafter 'CO'), which is\nthe second most abundant molecule in the Universe. Keres et al.\n(2003) reported the first attempt to derive the local luminosity\nfunction (LF) of CO(1 \u2212 0) (the lowest energy transition of the\nCO molecule) from which they inferred the H2 MF and the local\n\u03a9H2 = 1.1 \u00b1 0.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 h\u22121 , assuming a constant CO(1 \u2212 0)H2 conversion factor. It has not yet been possible to estimate the\ncosmic H2 abundance at high redshift. However, a few detections\nof H2 absorption in the lines-of-sight to QSOs have been reported\n(e.g. Noterdaeme et al. 2008; Tumlinson et al. 2010; Srianand et al.\n2010), as well as CO detections in a large number of luminous\nstar-forming galaxies (e.g. Greve et al. 2005; Geach et al. 2009;\nDaddi et al. 2010; Tacconi et al. 2010).\nMeasurements of the HI and H2 mass content, as well as other\ngalaxy properties, are available in relatively large samples of local\ngalaxies (running into a few hundreds), allowing the characterisation of scaling relations between the cold gas and the stellar mass\ncontent. From these samples it has been possible to determine that\nthe molecular-to-atomic gas ratio correlates with stellar mass, and\nthat there is an anti-correlation between the HI-to-stellar mass ratio\nand stellar mass (e.g. Bothwell et al. 2009; Catinella et al. 2010;\nSaintonge et al. 2011). However, these correlations exhibit large\nscatter and are either subject to biases in the construction of observational samples, such as inhomogeneity in the selection criteria,\nor sample a very narrow range of galaxy properties.\nThe observational constraints on HI and H2 at higher redshifts\nwill improve dramatically over the next decade with the next generation of radio and sub-millimeter telescopes such as the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP; Johnston et al. 2008), the Karoo Array Telescope (MeerKAT; Booth et al. 2009) and the Square\nKilometre Array (SKA; Schilizzi et al. 2008) which aim to detect 21 cm emission from HI, and the Atacama Large Millimeter\nArray (ALMA; Wootten & Thompson 2009) and the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT; Hughes et al. 2010) which are designed\nto detect emission from molecules. Here we investigate the predictions of galaxy formation models for the evolution of the HI\nand H2 gas content of galaxies, taking advantage of the development of realistic SF models (e.g. Mac Low & Klessen 2004;\nPelupessy et al. 2006; Blitz & Rosolowsky 2006; Krumholz et al.\n2009; Pelupessy & Papadopoulos 2009; see McKee & Ostriker\n2007 for a review). In our approach, a successful model is one that,\nat the same time, reproduces the observed stellar masses, luminosities, morphologies and the atomic and molecular gas contents of\n\ngalaxies at the present day. Using such a model, it is reasonable to\nextend the predictions to follow the evolution of the gas contents of\ngalaxies towards high redshift.\nUntil recently, the ISM of galaxies in semi-analytic models was treated as a single star-forming phase (e.g. Cole et al.\n2000; Springel et al. 2001; Cattaneo et al. 2008; Lagos et al. 2008;\nSomerville et al. 2008). The first attempts to predict the separate HI\nand H2 contents of galaxies in semi-analytic models postprocessed\nthe output of single phase ISM treatments to add this information\na posteriori (e.g. Obreschkow et al. 2009a; Power et al. 2010). It\nwas only very recently that a proper fully self-consistent treatment\nof the ISM and SF in galaxies throughout the cosmological calculation was made (Cook et al. 2010; Fu et al. 2010; Lagos et al. 2011).\nWe show in this work that this consistent treatment is necessary to\nmake progress in understanding the gas contents of galaxies.\nWe use the semi-analytical model GALFORM (Cole et al.\n2000) in a \u039b cold dark matter (\u039bCDM) cosmology with the improved treatment of SF implemented by Lagos et al. (2011), which\nexplicitly splits the hydrogen content in the ISM of galaxies into\nHI and H2 . Our aims are (i) to study whether the models are able\nto predict HI and H2 MFs in agreement with the observed ones at\nz = 0, (ii) to follow the evolution of the MFs towards high-redshift,\n(iii) to compare with the observational results described above and\n(iv) to study scaling relations of H2 /HI with galaxy properties. By\ndoing so, it is possible to establish which physical processes are\nresponsible for the evolution of HI and H2 in galaxies.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72 we describe the main\ncharacteristics of the GALFORM model. In \u00a73 we present local universe scaling relations and compare with available observations. In\n\u00a74 we present the local HI and H2 MFs, and the Infrared (IR)-CO\nluminosity relation. We also investigate which galaxies dominate\nthe HI and H2 MFs and predict their evolution up to z = 8, and\nstudy the HI mass density measured in stacked samples of galaxies.\nIn \u00a75, we present predictions for the scaling relations of the H2 /HI\nratio with galaxy properties and analyse the mechanisms which underly these relations. \u00a76 presents the evolution of the cosmic densities of HI and H2 , and compares with observations. We also determine which range of halo mass dominates these densities. Finally,\nwe discuss our results and present our conclusions in \u00a77.\n\n2 MODELLING THE TWO-PHASE COLD GAS IN\nGALAXIES\nWe study the evolution of the cold gas content of galaxies by\nsplitting the ISM into atomic and molecular hydrogen components in the GALFORM semi-analytical model of galaxy formation (Cole et al. 2000; Benson et al. 2003; Baugh et al. 2005;\nBower et al. 2006; Benson & Bower 2010; Lagos et al. 2011).\nThe model takes into account the main physical processes that\nshape the formation and evolution of galaxies. These are: (i) the\ncollapse and merging of dark matter (DM) halos, (ii) the shockheating and radiative cooling of gas inside DM halos, leading to\nthe formation of galactic disks, (iii) quiescent star formation in\ngalaxy disks, (iv) feedback from supernovae (SNe), from active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN) heating and from photo-ionization of the\ninter-galactic medium (IGM), (v) chemical enrichment of stars and\ngas, and (vi) galaxy mergers driven by dynamical friction within\ncommon DM halos which can trigger bursts of SF, and lead to the\nformation of spheroids (for a review of these ingredients see Baugh\n2006; Benson 2010). Galaxy luminosities are computed from the\npredicted star formation and chemical enrichment histories using\n\n\fEvolution of the HI and H2 gas content\na stellar population synthesis model. Dust extinction at different\nwavelengths is calculated self-consistently from the gas and metal\ncontents of each galaxy and the predicted scale lengths of the\ndisk and bulge components using a radiative transfer model (see\nCole et al. 2000 and Lacey et al. 2011b).\nWe base our study on the scheme of Lagos et al. (2011; hereafter L11) in which parameter-free SF laws were implemented in\nGALFORM. In the next four subsections we briefly describe the dark\nmatter (DM) merger trees, the GALFORM models considered, the\nmain features introduced by L11 into GALFORM, and the importance of the treatment of the ISM made in this work.\n\n2.1 Dark matter halo merger trees\nGALFORM requires the formation histories of DM halos to model\ngalaxy formation (see Cole et al. 2000). To generate these histories we use an improved version of the Monte-Carlo scheme of\nCole et al. (2000), which was derived by Parkinson et al. (2008).\nThe Parkinson et al. scheme is tuned to match merger trees extracted from the Millennium simulation of Springel et al. (2005). In\nthis approach, realizations of the merger histories of halos are generated over a range of halo masses. The range of masses simulated\nchanges with redshift in order to follow a representative sample of\nhalos, which cover a similar range of abundances at each epoch.\nBy using Monte-Carlo generated merger histories, we can extend the range of halo masses considered beyond the resolution\nlimit of the Millennium simulation, in which the smallest resolved\nhalo mass is \u2248 1010 h\u22121 M\u2299 at all redshifts. This is necessary to\nmake an accurate census of the global cold gas density of the universe which is dominated by low mass galaxies in low mass haloes\n(Kim et al. 2011; Power et al. 2010; L11).\nWe adopt a minimum halo mass of Mhalo = 5 \u00d7 108 h\u22121 M\u2299\nat z = 0 to enable us to predict cold gas mass structures down\nto the current observed limits (i.e. MHI \u2248 106 M\u2299 , Martin et al.\n2010). At higher redshifts, this lower limit is scaled with redshift\nto roughly track the evolution of the break in the halo mass function, so that we simulate objects with a comparable range of space\ndensities at each redshift. This allows us to follow a representative\nsample of dark matter halos, ensuring that we resolve the structures\nrich in cold gas at every redshift. Power et al. (2010) showed that\nusing a fixed tree resolution, as imposed by N -body simulations,\ncan lead to a substantial underestimate of the gas content of the\nuniverse at z & 3.\nThe cosmological parameters are input parameters for the\ngalaxy formation model and influence the parameter values adopted\nto describe the galaxy formation physics. The two models used in\nthis paper have somewhat different cosmological parameters for\nhistorical reasons; these cannot be homogenized without revisiting the choice of the galaxy formation parameters. The parameters used in Baugh et al. (2005) are a present-day matter density\nof \u03a9m = 0.3, a cosmological constant \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, a baryon density of \u03a9baryons = 0.04, a Hubble constant h = 0.7 and a power\nspectrum normalization of \u03c38 = 0.93. In the case of Bower et al.\n(2006), \u03a9m = 0.25, \u03a9\u039b = 0.75, \u03a9baryons = 0.045, h = 0.73 and\n\u03c38 = 0.9.\n\n2.2 Galaxy formation models\nWe use as starting points the Baugh et al. (2005) and Bower et al.\n(2006) models, hereafter referred to as Bau05 and Bow06 respectively. The most important differences between these models reside\n\n3\n\nin the mechanism used to suppress SF in massive galaxies and the\nform of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) adopted in starbursts.\nThe Bau05 model invokes superwinds driven by SNe, which expel\ngas from the halo with a mass ejection rate proportional to the SFR.\nThe Bow06 model includes a treatment of the heating of halo gas by\nAGN, that suppresses gas cooling in haloes where the central black\nhole (BH) has an Eddington luminosity which exceeds the cooling\nluminosity by a specified factor. The Bau05 model assumes that\nthe IMF is top-heavy during starbursts (driven by galaxy mergers)\nand has a Kennicutt (1983) form during quiescent SF in galactic\ndisks. The Bow06 model assumes a universal Kennicutt IMF (see\nAlmeida et al. 2007, Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2009 and Lacey et al. 2011b\nfor a detailed comparison between the two models). Both models give good agreement with the observed bJ - and K-band LFs\nat z = 0, but only the Bow06 model agrees with the K-band LF at\nz > 0.5, regardless of the SF law used (see L11). The insensitivity of the LF of galaxies in optical and near-infrared (IR) bands to\nthe choice of the SF law was already noted by L11 and interpreted\nas the result of an interplay between the different channels of SF\nactivity in the model (i.e. burst and quiescent modes).\nAn important modification made in this work with respect to\nthe original assumptions of the Bau05 and Bow06 models resides\nin the parameters for the reionisation model, following Lacey et al.\n(2011b). It is assumed that no gas is allowed to cool in haloes with a\ncircular velocity below Vcrit at redshifts below zreion (Benson et al.\n2003). Taking into account recent simulations by Okamoto et al.\n(2008) and observational constraints on the reionisation redshift\n(Spergel et al. 2003), we adopt Vcrit = 30 km s\u22121 and zreion = 10,\nin contrast with the values adopted by Baugh et al. (2005) and\nBower et al. (2006) (Vcrit = 50\u221260 km s\u22121 and zreion = 6). Even\nthough this affects the gas content of low mass halos, the changes\nare not significant for the results shown in this paper.\n2.3 The interstellar medium and star formation in galaxies\nWe use the SF scheme implemented in GALFORM by L11. L11\ntested different SF laws in which the neutral hydrogen in the ISM\nis split into HI and H2 . Two of the most promising are: (i) the\nBlitz & Rosolowsky (2006) empirical SF law and (ii) the theoretical SF law of Krumholz et al. (2009). We briefly describe these\nbelow.\n(i) The empirical SF law of Blitz & Rosolowsky is of the form,\n\u03a3SFR = \u03bdSF fmol \u03a3gas ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03a3SFR and \u03a3gas are the surface densities of SFR and total\ncold gas mass, respectively, \u03bdSF is the inverse of the SF timescale\nfor the molecular gas and fmol = \u03a3mol /\u03a3gas is the molecular to\ntotal gas mass surface density ratio. The molecular and total gas\ncontents include the contribution from helium, while HI and H2\nonly include hydrogen (which in total corresponds to a fraction\nXH = 0.74 of the overall cold gas mass). The ratio fmol depends on\nthe internal hydrostatic pressure as \u03a3H2 /\u03a3HI = fmol /(fmol \u2212 1) =\n(Pext /P0 )\u03b1 . Here kB is Boltzmann's constant and the values of\n\u03bdSF = 5.25 \u00b1 2.5 \u00d7 10\u221210 yr\u22121 (Leroy et al. 2008; Bigiel et al.\n2011), \u03b1 = 0.92 \u00b1 0.07 and log(P0 /kB [cm\u22123 K]) = 4.54 \u00b1 0.07\n(Blitz & Rosolowsky 2006) are derived from fits to the observational data. To calculate Pext , we use the approximation from\nElmegreen (1993),\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0015\n\u03c0\n\u03c3g\nPext \u2248 G\u03a3gas \u03a3gas +\n(2)\n\u03a3\u22c6 ,\n2\n\u03c3\u22c6\nwhere \u03a3gas and \u03a3\u22c6 are the total surface densities of the gas\n\n\fClaudia del P. Lagos\n\nand stars, respectively, and \u03c3g and \u03c3\u22c6 are their respective vertical velocity dispersions. We assume a constant gas velocity dispersion, \u03c3g = 10 km s\u22121 , following recent observational results\n(Leroy et al. 2008). In the case of \u03c3\u22c6 , we assume\nself-gravity of the\n\u221a\nstellar disk in the vertical direction, \u03c3\u22c6 = \u03c0G h\u22c6 \u03a3\u22c6 , where h\u22c6 is\nthe disk height (see L11 for details). We estimate h\u22c6 by assuming\nthat it is proportional to the radial exponential scale length of the\ndisk, as observed in local spiral galaxies, with Reff /h\u22c6 \u2248 7.3 \u00b1 1.2\n(Kregel et al. 2002). Hereafter, we will refer to the version of the\nmodel in which the Blitz & Rosolowsky empirical SF law is applied by appending BR to the model name.\n(ii) In the theoretical SF law of Krumholz et al. (2009), fmol in\nEq. 1 depends on the balance between the dissociation of molecules\ndue to the far-UV interstellar radiation, and their formation on the\nsurfaces of dust grains, and \u03bdSF the inverse of the time required to\nconvert all of the gas in a cloud into stars. In their prescription, fmol\ndepends on the metallicity of the gas and the surface density of a\nmolecular cloud, \u03a3complex . Krumholz et al. relate \u03a3complex to the\nsmooth gas surface density, \u03a3gas , through a clumping factor that is\nset to c = 5 to reproduce the observed \u03a3SFR \u2212 \u03a3gas relation. In\nsummary, the Krumholz et al. SF law is,\n\u03a3SFR = \u03bdSF (\u03a3gas ) fmol \u03a3gas ,\n\n(3)\n\n3\n2\n\nKMT\n\n1\n\nHI\nH2\n\n0\nlog(\u03a3H / h-1 MO\u2022 pc-2)\n\n4\n\n-1\n-2\n3\n2\n\nBR\n\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nr/r50\nFigure 1.

Hereafter,\nwe will denote the version of the model where the Krumholz, McKee & Tumlinson theoretical SF law is applied by KMT.\nWe split the total hydrogen mass component into its atomic\nand molecular forms and calculate the SFR based on the molecular\ngas mass. It is important to note that in the BR SF law the inverse of\nthe SF timescale for the molecular gas, \u03bdSF (Eq. 1), is constant, and\ntherefore the SFR directly depends only on the molecular content,\nand only indirectly on the total cold gas content through the disk\npressure. However, in the KMT SF law, \u03bdSF is a function of cold\ngas surface density (Eq. 4), and therefore the SFR does not only\ndepend on the H2 content, but also on the cold gas surface density\nin a non-linear fashion.\nFor starbursts the situation is less clear. Observational uncertainties, such as the conversion factor between CO and H2\nin starbursts, and the intrinsic compactness of star-forming regions, have not allowed a good characterisation of the SF law (e.g.\nKennicutt 1998; Genzel et al. 2010; Combes et al. 2011). Theoretically, it has been suggested that the SF law in starbursts is different from that in normal star-forming galaxies: the relation between\n\u03a3H2 /\u03a3HI and gas pressure is expected to be dramatically different in environments of very high gas densities typical of starbursts\n(Pelupessy et al. 2006, Pelupessy & Papadopoulos 2009), where\nthe ISM is predicted to be always dominated by H2 independently\nof the gas pressure. For these reasons we choose to apply the BR\nand KMT laws only during quiescent SF (fuelled by cooled gas accretion into galactic disks) and retain the original SF prescription\nfor starbursts (see Cole et al. 2000 and L11 for details). In the latter,\nthe SF timescale is proportional to the bulge dynamical timescale\nabove a minimum floor value and involves the whole cold gas content of the galaxy, SFR = M cold /\u03c4SF (see Granato et al. 2000\nand Lacey et al. 2008 for details). Throughout this work we assume\n\nthat in starbursts, the cold gas content is fully molecular, fmol = 1.\nNote that this is similar to assuming that the BR pressure-law holds\nin starbursts (except with a different \u03bdSF ) given that large gas and\nstellar densities lead to fmol \u2248 1.\n2.3.1 Radial profiles of atomic and molecular hydrogen\nIn order to visualize the behaviour of the HI and H2 components\nof the ISM of galaxies predicted in the models, we have taken the\noutput of the original Bow06 model and postprocessed it to calculate the HI and H2 surface density profiles based on the expressions\nabove. Fig. 1 shows the surface density profiles of HI and H2 for\nrandomly chosen model spiral galaxies on applying the KMT (top\npanel) or the BR (bottom panel) laws. The HI extends to much\nlarger radii than the H2 . This is a consequence of the total gas surface density dependence of the H2 /HI ratio in both SF laws. Note\nthat the KMT SF law gives a steeper decrease in the radial profile\nof H2 compared to the BR SF law. The BR SF law depends on the\nsurface density of gas and stars, through the disk pressure, while\nthe KMT SF law depends on the surface density and metallicity of\nthe gas.\nWe have compared our predictions for the size of the HI and\nH2 disks with observations. The models predict a correlation between the HI isophotal radius, lHI , defined at a HI surface density of\n1M\u2299 pc\u22122 , and the enclosed HI mass, MHI (lHI ), which is in very\ngood agreement with observations, irrespective of the SF law applied. Both models predict MHI (lHI )/M\u2299 \u2248 2\u00d7107 (lHI /kpc)1.9 ,\nwhile the observed relation for Ursa Major is MHI (lHI )/M\u2299 \u2248\n1.8 \u00d7 107 (lHI /kpc)1.86 (e.g. Verheijen & Sancisi 2001). On the\nother hand, the median of the relation between the exponential\nscale length of the H2 and HI disks predicted by the model is\nRH2 \u2248 0.4 RHI , while the relation inferred by combining the observational results of Regan et al. (2001) and Verheijen & Sancisi\n(2001) is RH2 = (0.44 \u00b1 0.12) RHI . The model agrees well with\nthe observed relations indicating that, in general terms, the ISM of\nmodelled galaxies looks realistic.\n\n\fEvolution of the HI and H2 gas content\n\ngas mass is the main driver of the strong dip at low HI masses in\nthe original model. Remarkably, our new modelling helps reproduce the observed number density even down to the current limits,\nMHI \u2248 106 h\u22122 M\u2299 .\nThe new SF scheme to model the ISM of galaxies represents\na step forward in understanding the gas content of galaxies. In the\nrest of the paper we make use of the models where the parameterfree SF laws are applied throughout the full calculation.\n\n0\n\nz=0\n-1\nlog(dn/dlnMHI/h3Mpc-3)\n\n5\n\n-2\n-3\nZwaan etal.

Symbols show observational results at z = 0 from Zwaan et al. (2005) using HIPASS and\nMartin et al. (2010) using ALFALFA, as labelled.\n\n2.4 Consistent calculation or postprocessing?\nPrevious attempts to calculate the separate HI and H2 contents\nof galaxies in a cosmological scenario have been made by postprocessing the output of existing semi-analytic models using\nspecifically the BR SF prescription (e.g. Obreschkow et al. 2009a;\nPower et al. 2010). Here we show that a self-consistent calculation\nof the ISM of galaxies, in which the new SF laws are included in\nthe model, is necessary throughout in order to explain the observed\ngas properties of galaxies. To do this we choose as an example the\nBow06 model and the BR SF law.\nFig. 2 shows the HI MF in the original Bow06 model when\na fixed conversion ratio of Mmol /Mcold = 0.27 is assumed (dotted line; Baugh et al. 2004), when a variable conversion factor is\ncalculated based on the BR pressure law (dashed line) and in the\nBow06.BR model (solid line), where the BR SF law is applied\nconsistently throughout the calculation. Symbols show a compilation of observational data. The original Bow06 model with a fixed\nH2 /HI conversion gives a poor match to the observed HI MF. Postprocessing the output of this model to implement a variable H2 /HI\nratio gives a different prediction which still disagrees with the observations. If we consistently apply the BR SF law throughout the\nwhole galaxy formation model, there is a substantial change in\nthe model prediction which is also in much better agreement with\nthe observations. These differences are mainly due to the fact that\nthe SFR in the prescription of Bow06 scales linearly with the total cold gas mass (as in starbursts, see \u00a72.3), while in the case of\nthe BR SF law this dependence is non-linear. Note that a threshold in gas surface density below which galaxies are not allowed\nto form stars, as originally proposed by Kennicutt (1989) and as\nassumed in several other semi-analytic models (e.g. Croton et al.\n2006; Tecce et al. 2010), produces a much less pronounced, but\nstill present dip (see L11). Thus, the linearity of the SFR with cold\n\nHere we present the model predictions for various scaling relations\nbetween H2 and HI and other galaxy properties and compare with\nobservations. In \u00a73.1 we show how the H2 /HI ratio scales with stellar and cold gas mass. In \u00a73.2 we present predictions for this ratio\nas a function of galaxy morphology, and in \u00a73.3, we study dependence of the HI and H2 masses on stellar mass.\n\n3.1 The dependence of H2 /HI on galaxy mass\nThe prescriptions described in \u00a72 that split the ISM into its atomic\nand molecular components enable the model to directly predict correlations between the H2 /HI ratio and galaxy properties. Fig. 3\nshows the H2 /HI ratio as a function of stellar mass (top panels)\nand total cold gas mass (bottom panels) at z = 0 for the Bow06\n(solid lines) and the Bau05 (dashed lines) models using the BR and\nthe KMT SF laws. The model predictions are compared to local\nobservational estimates from Leroy et al. (2008). The errorbars on\nthe model show the 10 and 90 percentiles of the model distribution\nin different mass bins. In the case of the observations, indicative errorbars on the H2 /HI estimate due to the uncertainty in the CO-H2\nconversion factor are shown at the top of the top-left panel (i.e. the\ndifference in the value inferred for starbursts and the Milky-Way,\n\u2248 0.6dex; see \u00a74.2). Note that in this and subsequent figures where\nwe compare with observations, we plot masses in units of h\u22122 M\u2299\nto match observational units. For other plots we use the simulation\nunits, h\u22121 M\u2299 .\nLeroy et al. estimated stellar masses from 3.6\u03bcm luminosities, which were transformed into K-band luminosities using an\nempirical conversion. Stellar masses were then calculated from the\nrelation of Bell et al. (2003) between the stellar mass-to-light ratio\nin the K\u2212band and B \u2212 V colour1 . Thus the error on the stellar\nmass might be as large as a factor of 1.5 (considering the dispersion\nof 0.15 dex in the B \u2212 V vs. K-band relation).\nThe Bow06 model with the BR SF law predicts H2 /HI ratios\nwhich are in very good agreement with the observed ones. The\nBow06.KMT model fails to match the observed H2 /HI ratios at\nall stellar and cold gas masses. This is due to the sharp decline of\nthe radial profile of H2 (see Fig. 1), which results in lower global\nH2 /HI ratios in disagreement with the observed ones. In the case of\nthe Bow06.BR model, it might appear unsurprising that this model\nis in good agreement with the observed correlation given that it is\nbased on the empirical correlation between H2 /HI and the hydrostatic pressure in the disk (see \u00a72). However, it is only because we\n1 Given that Leroy et al. adopt a Kroupa (2001) IMF, we apply a small\ncorrection of 1.02 to adapt their stellar masses to account for our choice of\na Kennicutt (1983) IMF.\n\n\f6\n\nClaudia del P.

The success of the\nBau05.KMT model, in contrast with the Bow06.KMT model, is\nmainly due to the higher gas masses and metallicites predicted in\nthe former model. However, the Bau05.BR and Bau05.KMT models fail to reproduce the evolution of the K-band LF and the z = 0\ngas-to-luminosity ratios (see L11 for a complete discussion of the\nimpact of each SF law on the two models).\n3.2 The dependence of H2 /HI on galaxy morphology\nIt has been shown observationally that the ratio of H2 /HI masses\ncorrelates strongly with morphological type, with early-type galaxies characterised by higher H2 /HI ratios than late-type galaxies (e.g.\nYoung & Knezek 1989; Bettoni et al. 2003; Lisenfeld et al. 2011).\nFig. 4 shows the H2 /HI mass ratio as a function of the bulge-to-total\nluminosity ratio in the B-band, B/T , for different B-band absolute\nmagnitude ranges for the Bow06.BR model. The right hand panel\nof Fig. 4, which shows the brightest galaxies, compares the model\npredictions with observations. All observational data have morphological types derived from a visual classification of the B-band\nimages (de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991), and have also been selected\nin blue bands (e.g. Simien & de Vaucouleurs 1986; Weinzirl et al.\n2009). The comparison with observational data is shown for galaxies in the model with MB \u2212 5 log(h) < \u221219, which roughly corresponds to the selection criteria applied in the observational data.\n\nNote that we have plotted only galaxies in the model that have\nMHI /M\u22c6 > 10\u22123 and MH2 /M\u22c6 > 10\u22123 , which correspond to\nthe lowest HI and H2 gas fractions detected in the observational\ndata shown. The Bow06.BR model predicts a relation between the\nH2 /HI ratio and B/T that is in good agreement with the observations. Note that, for the last bin, B/T < 0.2, the model predicts slightly higher median H2 /HI ratios than the values inferred\nfrom observations. However, in all cases a constant CO(1 \u2212 0)-H2\nconversion factor was assumed in the observational sample to infer the H2 mass. This might not be a good approximation in the\nlow-metallicity environments typical of irregular or late-type spirals, where the H2 mass might be underestimated if a conversion\nfactor typical of normal spiral galaxies is applied (e.g. Boselli et al.\n2002; see \u00a74.2.1 for a discussion).\nThe higher H2 /HI ratios in early-type galaxies can be understood in the context of the dependence of the H2 /HI ratio on gas\npressure built into the BR SF law. Even though gas fractions in\nearly-type galaxies are in general lower than in late-type galaxies,\nthey are also systematically more compact than a late-type counterpart of the same mass (see Lagos et al. 2011), resulting in higher\ngas pressure, and consequently a higher H2 /HI ratio. Also note that\nthere is a dependence on galaxy luminosity: faint galaxies typically\nhave lower H2 /HI ratios than their bright counterparts. This is due\nto the contribution of the stellar surface density to the pressure,\nwhich increases in massive galaxies (see Eq 2).\n\n3.3 The relation between HI, H2 and stellar mass\nAnother form of scaling relation often studied observationally is\nthe atomic or molecular hydrogen-to-stellar mass ratio as a function of stellar mass. Recently, these relations have been reported\nfor the atomic and molecular gas contents in a homogeneous sample of relatively massive galaxies by Catinella et al. (2010) and\nSaintonge et al. (2011), respectively, with the aim of establishing\nfundamental relations between the stellar content of galaxies and\ntheir cold gas mass. Fig. 5 shows these relations for the Bow06.BR\nmodel at z = 0 compared to values reported for individual galaxies\nin these surveys with detected H2 or HI, respectively2 . Also shown\nin the top panel are a data compilation from the literature presented\nin Bothwell et al. (2009) and individual galaxies from the HERA\nCO Line Extragalactic Survey (HERACLES; Leroy et al. 2009).\nMeasurements of MH2 /Mstellar are subject to large errors (up to\n0.25 dex) given the uncertainty in the CO-H2 conversion factor (see\ndiscussion in \u00a74.2.1). Observed MHI /Mstellar ratios are more accurate given the direct detection of HI. Horizontal lines in Fig. 5\nshow representative observational sensitivity limits (which are not\nexactly the same in all samples). Contours show the regions where\ndifferent fractions of galaxies in the model lie, normalized in bins\nof stellar mass. The contours are not very sensitive to the location\nof the sensitivity limits. The model predicts the right location and\nscatter of galaxies in these planes in contrast to previous models\n(see Saintonge et al. 2011 for a discussion). Note that the literature\ncompilation of Bothwell et al. shows larger scatter than the HERACLES, GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey (GASS) and CO Legacy\nDatabase for the GASS survey (COLD GASS).

Contours show the regions within which\ndifferent volume-weighted percentages of the galaxies lie for a given (B/T )B , with the scale shown by the key. For reference, the dashed line shows the\nmedian of the model distribution. Observational results from Young & Knezek (1989), Bettoni et al. (2003), Leroy et al. (2008) and Lisenfeld et al. (2011) are\nshown as symbols in the right-hand panel, and we combine them so that B/T < 0.2 corresponds to Irr, Sm, Sd galaxies; 0.2 < B/T < 0.5 corresponds to\nSc, Sb, Sa galaxies; B/T > 0.5 corresponds to E and S0 galaxies (see de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991 for a description of each morphological type).\n\nThe MH2 /Mstellar ratio in the model is only weakly correlated with stellar mass, in contrast to the MHI /Mstellar ratio which\nis strongly dependent on stellar mass, in agreement with the observations. The decrease in the MHI /Mstellar ratio with increasing\nstellar mass is the dominant factor in determining the positive relation between H2 /HI and stellar mass in Fig. 3 given the small\nvariations of the MH2 /Mstellar ratio with stellar mass.\nThe predicted relation between MH2 and M\u22c6 (top-panel of\nFig. 5) is close to linear for galaxies with MH2 /M\u22c6 & 0.05. These\ngalaxies lie on the active star-forming sequence in the M\u22c6 \u2212 SFR\nplane (see L11), due to an approximately linear relation between\nMH2 and SFR, although characterised by a large scatter (see\n\u00a74.2.3). What drives the approximately constant SFR/M\u22c6 and\nMH2 /M\u22c6 ratios for galaxies on the active star-forming sequence\nis the balance between accretion and outflows, mainly regulated by\nthe timescale for gas to be reincorporated into the host halo after\nejection by SNe (see L11 for details). In the case of HI, the model\npredicts that, for galaxies plotted in the bottom-panel of Fig. 5, the\nHI weakly correlates with stellar mass, MHI \u221d M\u22c60.15 , as a result\nof the feedback mechanisms included in the model.\n\n4 ATOMIC AND MOLECULAR HYDROGEN MASS\nFUNCTIONS\nThe two-phase ISM scheme implemented in GALFORM (see \u00a72)\nallows us to study the evolution of the HI and H2 in galaxies in\nterms of the MFs and their evolution. In the next two subsections\nwe analyse the main mechanisms which shape the HI and H2 MFs\nand investigate how these interplay to determine the model predictions.\n\n4.1 Atomic hydrogen mass function\nFig. 6 shows the z = 0 HI mass functions (HI MF) for the Bow06\nand Bau05 models using the BR and the KMT SF laws, and observational results from Zwaan et al. (2005) and Martin et al. (2010).\n\nWith the BR SF law, both the Bow06 and Bau05 models give\npredictions which are in reasonable agreement with the observed\nHI MF. However, when applying the KMT SF law both models\ngive a poor match to the observed HI MF, with the Bau05 model\nunderpredicting the number density of massive HI galaxies, whilst\nthe Bow06 model greatly overpredicts the abundance of galaxies\naround MHI \u223c 109 h\u22122 M\u2299 . The latter is expected from the poor\nagreement between the H2 /HI-stellar mass scaling relation predicted by Bow06.KMT and the observed one (Fig. 3). In the case\nof Bau05.KMT, the poor agreement is expected from the low gasto-luminosity ratios reported by L11.\nCook et al. (2010) showed that, by including the BR SF law\nself-consistently in their semi-analytic model, the number density\nof low HI mass galaxies is substantially increased, in agreement\nwith our results. However, in their model this effect is still not\nenough to bring the predictions into agreement with the observed\nHI MF. The overproduction of low mass galaxies is also seen in\ntheir predicted optical LFs, suggesting that the difference resides\nin the treatment of SN feedback and reionisation (see Bower et al.\n2006; Benson & Bower 2010). In the case of the KMT SF law, there\nare no published results using the full SF law in semi-analytical\nmodels. Fu et al. (2010) implemented the H2 /HI metallicity- and\ngas surface density-dependence of the KMT SF law, but assumed a\nconstant SF timescale for the molecular gas, instead of the original\ndependence on gas surface density (see Eq. 4). Furthermore, these\nauthors compared their predictions to the observations of the HI\nMF only over the restricted range 109 . MHI /h\u22122 M\u2299 . 1010 ,\none decade in mass compared to the five decades plotted in Fig. 6,\nso that it is hard to judge how well this KMT-like model really performs.\nGiven that neither of the models using the KMT SF law predict\nthe right HI MF or H2 /HI scaling relations, and that the Bau05\nmodel fails to predict the right K-band LF at z > 0.5, we now\nfocus on the Bow06.BR model when presenting the predictions for\nthe gas contents of galaxies at low and high redshifts.\n\n\fClaudia del P.

Central galaxies contribute less to the number density in\nthis mass range due to reionisation. Hot gas in halos with circular velocity Vcirc < 30 km s\u22121 is not allowed to cool at z < 10,\nthereby suppressing the accretion of cold gas onto central galaxies hosted by these halos. These haloes have masses typically\nMhalo < 1011 h\u22121 M\u2299 (Benson 2010). This suggests that the HI\ncontent of galaxies in isolation may lead to constraints on reionisation (Kim et al. in prep.). The HI MF of satellite galaxies does not\nshow the dip at low HI masses observed in the HI MF of central\n\ngalaxies because the satellites were mainly formed before reionisation. Galaxies of intermediate and high HI mass mainly correspond\nto central galaxies. The predominance in the HI MF of central and\nsatellite galaxies in the high and low mass ends, respectively, is\nindependent of the model adopted.\nThe Bow06.BR model slightly overpredicts the number density of galaxies in the mass range 3 \u00d7 107 h\u22122 M\u2299 < MHI <\n3\u00d7108 h\u22122 M\u2299 . This is mainly due to the slightly larger radii of the\nmodel galaxies compared to observations (see L11), which leads\nto lower pressure within the galactic disk and therefore to a slight\noverestimate of the atomic hydrogen content.\nThe bottom panel of Fig. 7 shows the contribution to the HI\nMF from galaxies hosted by halos of different masses. The HI MF\nat intermediate and high HI masses, i.e. MHI & 5 \u00d7 107 h\u22122 M\u2299 ,\nis dominated by galaxies hosted by low and intermediate mass DM\nhalos, Mhalo . 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 , while lower HI mass galaxies are\nprimarily satellites in higher mass halos. This scale in the DM halo\nmass (Mhalo \u2248 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 ) has been shown to be set by the efficient suppression of SF in higher mass DM haloes, mainly driven\nby AGN feedback which shuts down gas cooling (Kim et al. 2011).\nIn lower mass halos, in which AGN feedback does not suppress\ngas cooling, the cold gas content scales with the stellar mass of the\ngalaxy and with the mass of the host DM halo.\n4.1.2 Evolution of the HI mass function\nFig. 8 shows the evolution of the HI MF from z = 8 to z = 0. There\nis a high abundance of low HI mass galaxies at high redshift. This\nreduces with declining redshift as gas is depleted mainly through\nquiescent SF and starbursts. The number density of galaxies with\nlow HI masses, MHI . 107 h\u22122 M\u2299 , increases with redshift, being\na factor 4 larger at z = 6 than at z = 0. The number density of HI\ngalaxies with masses 107 h\u22122 M\u2299 . MHI . 108 h \u22122 M\u2299 increases\nby a factor of 2 from z = 0 to z = 1, with little evolution to z = 4.\nAt z > 4, the number density of galaxies in this mass range drops\n\n\fEvolution of the HI and H2 gas content\n0\n\n0\n\nBow06.BR\n\nz=0\n\nBow06.BR\n-1\nlog(dn/dlnMHI/h3Mpc-3)\n\nlog(dn/dlnMHI/h3Mpc-3)\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\nZwaan etal.

The high-mass end of the HI MF, MHI & 5 \u00d7 108 h\u22122 M\u2299 ,\ngrows hierarchically until z \u2248 1, increasing in number density by\nmore than two orders of magnitude. The evolution of the high-mass\nend tracks the formation of more massive haloes in which gas can\ncool, until AGN heating becomes important (at z \u2248 1). At z < 1\nthe high-mass end does not show appreciable evolution. The HI\nMF from the break upwards in mass is dominated by galaxies in\nintermediate mass halos. These are less affected by AGN feedback,\ndriving the hierarchical growth in the number density in the high\nHI mass range. Higher mass halos, Mhalo & 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 , are\nsubject to AGN feedback, which suppresses the cooling flow and\nreduces the cold gas reservoir in the central galaxies of these haloes.\nLower mass haloes, Mhalo . 1011 h\u22121 M\u2299 , are susceptible to SNe\n\nfeedback, which depletes the cold gas supply by heating the gas and\nreturning it to the hot halo.\nNote that our choice of parameters for reionisation affects\nmainly the low mass end of the MF at high redshifts. At z = 0 the\nabundance of galaxies with MHI . 108 h\u22122 M\u2299 would be lower by\na factor of 2 if a lower photoionisation redshift cut of zreion = 6\nwas assumed.\nThe characterisation of the HI MF at redshifts higher than\nz \u2248 0 will be a difficult task in future observations. The first\nmeasurements will come from stacking of stellar mass- or SFRselected galaxy samples, as has been done in the local Universe\n(e.g. Verheijen et al. 2007; Lah et al. 2007, 2009). Fig. 9 shows the\ncumulative HI mass per unit volume, \u03c1HI , at different redshifts\nfor samples of galaxies in the Bow06.BR model that have stellar\nmasses or SFRs larger than Mstellar or SFR, respectively. The estimated \u03c1HI from source stacking can be directly compared to our\npredictions for the same lower stellar mass or SFR limit. The median HI mass of galaxies as a function of stellar mass and SFR, is\nshown in the bottom-panels of Fig. 9. Errorbars represent the 10\nand 90 percentiles of the distributions, and are shown for three different redshifts. The HI mass-stellar mass relation becomes shallower with increasing redshift, but the scatter around the median\ndepends only weakly on redshift. The turnover of the median HI\nmass at Mstellar & 109 h\u22122 M\u2299 is produced by AGN feedback that\nefficiently suppresses any further gas cooling onto massive galaxies and, consequently, their cold gas content is reduced. The HI\nmass is weakly correlated with SFR, particularly at high redshift.\nThe median HI mass of galaxies spanning SFRs in the range plotted decreases with increasing redshift. This suggests that in order\nto detect low HI masses in observations at z \u2248 0.5 \u2212 2, stellar\nmass selected samples should be more effective than SFR selected\nsamples. However, it would still be necessary to sample down to\nvery low stellar masses (Mstellar > 108 h\u22121 M\u2299 ). Upcoming HI\nsurveys using telescopes such as ASKAP and MeerKAT, will be\nable to probe down to these HI masses.\n\n\fClaudia del P.

Our aim is to disentangle\nwhich processes primarily determine the evolution of H2 in galaxies.\n4.2.1 The present-day CO(1 \u2212 0) luminosity function\nObservationally, the most commonly used tracer of the H2\nmolecule is the CO molecule, and in particular, the CO(1\u22120) transition which is emitted in the densest, coldest regions of the ISM,\nwhere the H2 is locked up. Given that in the model we estimate the\nH2 content, we use a conversion factor to estimate the CO(1 \u2212 0)\nemission for a given abundance of H2 ,\nICO /K km s\u22121 =\n\nNH2 /cm\u22122\n.\nX \u00d7 10\u221220\n\n(5)\n\nHere NH2 is the column density of H2 and ICO is the integrated\nCO(1 \u2212 0) line intensity per unit surface area. The value of X\nhas been inferred observationally in a few galaxies, mainly through\nvirial estimations. Typical estimates for normal spiral galaxies\nrange between X \u2248 2.0 \u2212 3.5 (e.g. Young & Scoville 1991;\n\nFigure 10. The CO(1 \u2212 0) luminosity function at z = 0 for the Bow06.BR\nmodel compared to the observational estimates of Keres et al. (2003) for Bband (triangles) and a 60 \u03bcm (filled circles) selected samples of galaxies. To\ncalculate the CO(1 \u2212 0) luminosities we assume a H2 -to-CO conversion\nfactor, X, where NH2 /cm\u22122 = X \u00d7 10\u221220 ICO /K km s\u22121 . In the top\npanel, solid lines show the model predictions using fixed values of X, as\nlabelled, and the dashed line shows the LF using the metallicity-dependent\nconversion factor, X(Z), of Boselli et al. (2002). In the bottom panel, the\nsolid line shows the LF resulting from a conversion factor X = 3.5 and\nthe different lines show the contribution of galaxies in different metallicity\nranges, as labelled, for this choice of X.\n\nBoselli et al. 2002; Blitz et al. 2007). However, systematic variations in the value of X are both, theoretically predicted and inferred\nobservationally. For instance, theoretical calculations predict that\nlow metallicities, characteristic of dwarf galaxies, or high densities\nand large optical depths of molecular clumps in starburst galaxies,\nshould change X by a factor of up to 5 \u2212 10 in either direction\n(e.g. Bell et al. 2007; Meijerink et al. 2007; Bayet et al. 2009). Observations of dwarf galaxies favour larger conversion factors (e.g.\nX \u2248 7; e.g. Boselli et al. 2002), while the opposite holds in starburst galaxies (e.g. X \u2248 0.5; e.g. Meier & Turner 2004). This\nsuggests a metallicity-dependent conversion factor X. However,\n\n\fEvolution of the HI and H2 gas content\n0\n\nBow06.BR\nlog(dn/dlogMH2/h3Mpc-3)\n\n-1\n\nH2\n\n-2\n\n-3\nz=0\nz=0.5\nz=1\nz=2\nz=4\nz=6\nz=8\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n7\n\n8\n9\nlog(MH2/h-2 MO\u2022)\n\n10\n\n11\n\nBow06.BR\n\n-1\nlog(dn/dlog(LCO)/h3Mpc-3)\n\nestimates of the correlation between X and metallicity in nearby\ngalaxies vary significantly, from finding no correlation, when virial\nequilibrium of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) is assumed (e.g.\nYoung & Scoville 1991; Blitz et al. 2007), to correlations as strong\nas X \u221d (Z/Z\u2299 )\u22121 , when the total gas content is inferred from the\ndust content on assuming metallicity dependent dust-to-gas ratios\n(e.g. Guelin et al. 1993; Boselli et al. 2002).\nWe estimate the CO(1 \u2212 0) LF by using different conversion\nfactors favoured by the observational estimates described above.\nThe top panel of Fig. 10 shows the CO(1 \u2212 0) LF at z = 0 when\ndifferent constant conversion factors are assumed (i.e. independent\nof galaxy properties; solid lines). Observational estimates of the\nCO(1 \u2212 0) LF, made using a B-band and a 60 \u03bcm selected sample,\nare plotted using symbols (Keres et al. 2003). The model slightly\nunderestimates the number density at L\u22c6 for X > 1, but gives good\nagreement at fainter and at brighter luminosities for sufficiently\nlarge values of X (such as the ones inferred in normal spiral galaxies). In the predicted CO(1 \u2212 0) LF we include all galaxies with a\nLCO > 103 Jy km/s Mpc2 , while the LFs from Keres et al. were\ninferred from samples of galaxies selected using 60 \u03bcm or B-band\nfluxes. These criteria might bias the LF towards galaxies with large\namounts of dust or large recent SF. More data is needed from blind\nCO surveys in order to characterise the CO LF in non-biased samples of galaxies. This will be possible with new instruments such\nas the LMT.\nIn order to illustrate how much our predictions for the CO(1\u2212\n0) LF at z = 0 vary when adopting a metallicity-dependent\nconversion factor, X(Z), inferred independently from observations, we also plot in the top panel of Fig. 10 the LF when the\nX(Z) relation from Boselli et al. (2002) is adopted (dashed line),\n+0.05\nlog(X ) = 0.5+0.2\n\u22120.2 \u2212 1.02\u22120.05 log(Z/Z\u2299 ). Note that this correlation was determined using a sample of 12 galaxies with CO(1 \u2212 0)\nluminosities in quite a narrow range, LCO \u2248 5 \u00d7 105 \u2212 5 \u00d7\n106 Jy km/s Mpc2 . On adopting this conversion factor, the model\nlargely underestimates the break of the LF. This is due to the contribution of galaxies with different metallicities to the CO(1 \u2212 0) LF,\nas shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 10. The faint-end is dominated\nby low-metallicity galaxies (Z < Z\u2299 /3), while high-metallicity\ngalaxies (Z > Z\u2299 /3) dominate the bright-end. A smaller X\nfor low-metallicity galaxies combined with a larger X for highmetallicity galaxies would give better agreement with the observed\ndata. However, such a dependence of X on metallicity is opposite\nto that inferred by Boselli et al.\nBy considering a dependence of X on metallicity alone we\nare ignoring possible variations with other physical properties\nwhich could influence the state of GMCs, such as the interstellar far-UV radiation field and variations in the column density\nof gas (see for instance Pelupessy et al. 2006; Bayet et al. 2009;\nPelupessy & Papadopoulos 2009; Papadopoulos 2010). Recently,\nObreschkow et al. (2009b) showed that by using a simple phenomenological model to calculate the luminosity of different CO\ntransitions, which includes information about the ISM of galaxies,\nthe CO(1 \u2212 0) luminosity function of Fig. 10 can be reproduced.\nHowever, this modelling introduces several extra free parameters\ninto the model which, in most cases, are not well constrained by observations. A more detailed calculation of the CO LF which takes\ninto account the characteristics of the local ISM environment is beyond the scope of this paper and is addressed in a forthcoming paper (Lagos et al. 2011, in prep.).\nFor simplicity, in the next subsection we use a fixed CO(1 \u2212\n0)-H2 conversion factor of X = 3.5 for galaxies undergoing quiescent SF and X = 0.5 for those experiencing starbursts.

Two fixed CO(1\u2212\n0)-H2 conversion factors are assumed: X = 3.5 for quiescent SF and X =\n0.5 for burst SF. For reference, we show the CO(1 \u2212 0) LFs estimated\nat z = 0 by Keres et al. (2003) from B-band and 60 \u03bcm-selected galaxy\nsamples.\n\ncase of galaxies undergoing both SF modes, we use X = 3.5 and\nX = 0.5 for the quiescent and the burst components, respectively,\nfollowing the discussion above.\n\n4.2.2 Evolution of the H2 mass function\nAt high-redshift, measurements of the CO(J \u2192 J \u2212 1) LF are not\ncurrently available. ALMA will, however, provide measurements\nof molecular emission lines in high redshift galaxies with high accuracy. We therefore present in Fig. 11 predictions for the H2 MF\nand CO(1 \u2212 0) LF up to z = 8.\nThe high-mass end of the H2 MF shows strong evolution from\n\n\f12\n\nClaudia del P. Lagos\n\nz = 8 to z = 4, with the number density of galaxies increasing\nby an order of magnitude. In contrast, the number density of low\nH2 mass galaxies stays approximately constant over the same redshift range. From z = 4 to z = 2 the H2 MF hardly evolves, with\nthe number density of galaxies remaining the same over the whole\nmass range. From z = 2 to z = 0, the number density of massive\ngalaxies decreases by an order of magnitude, while the low-mass\nend decreases only by a factor \u2248 3. The peak in the number density of massive H2 galaxies at z = 2 \u2212 3 coincides with the peak\nof the SF activity (see L11; Fanidakis et al. 2010), in which huge\namounts of H2 are consumed forming new stars. The following decrease in the number density at z < 2 overlaps with strong galactic\nsize evolution, where galaxies at lower redshift are systematically\nlarger than their high redshift counterparts, reducing the gas surface density and therefore, the H2 fraction. We return to this point\nin \u00a75. The peak in the number density of high H2 mass galaxies at\nz = 2 \u2212 3 and the following decrease, contrasts with the monotonic increase in the number density of high HI mass galaxies with\ntime, suggesting a strong evolution of the H2 /HI global ratio with\nredshift. We come back to this point in \u00a76.\nThe evolution of the CO(1 \u2212 0) LF with redshift is shown in\nthe bottom panel of Fig. 11. Note that the z = 0 LF is very similar to the one shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 10, in which we\nassume a fixed CO-H2 conversion X = 3.5 for all galaxies. This\nis due to the low number of starburst events at z = 0. However,\nat higher redshifts, starbursts contribute more to the LF; the most\nluminous events at high redshift, in terms of CO luminosity, correspond to starbursts (see \u00a74.2.3).\nRecently Geach et al. (2011) compared the evolution of the\nobserved molecular-to-(stellar plus molecular mass) ratio (which\napproximates to the gas-to-baryonic ratio if the HI fraction is\nsmall), fgas = Mmol /(Mstellar + Mmol ), with predictions for the\nBow06.BR model at z 6 2, and found that the model gives a good\nmatch to the observed fgas evolution after applying the same observational selection cuts.\n4.2.3 The IR-CO luminosity relation\nOne way to study the global relation between the SFR and the\nmolecular gas mass in galaxies, and hence to constrain the SF law,\nis through the relation between the total IR luminosity, LIR , and the\nCO(1 \u2212 0) luminosity, LCO . We here define the total IR luminosity\nto be the integral over the rest-frame wavelength range 8\u22121000\u03bcm,\nwhich approximates the total luminosity emitted by interstellar\ndust, free from contamination by starlight. In dusty star-forming\ngalaxies, most of the UV radiation from young stars is absorbed by\ndust, and this dominates the heating of the dust, with only a small\ncontribution to the heating from older stars. Under these conditions,\nand if there is no significant heating of the dust by an AGN, we expect that LIR should be approximately proportional to the SFR,\nwith a proportionality factor that depends mainly on the IMF. On\nthe other hand, as already discussed, the CO(1 \u2212 0) luminosity has\nbeen found observationally to trace the molecular gas mass in local\ngalaxies, albeit with a proportionality factor that is different in starbursts from quiescently star-forming galaxies. Observations suggest that sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs) and QSOs at high redshift\nlie on a similar IR-CO luminosity relation to luminous IR galaxies\n(LIRGs) and ultra-luminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs) observed in the\nlocal Universe (see Solomon & Vanden Bout 2005 for a review).\nWe investigate here whether our model predictions are consistent\nwith these observational results.\nWe show in Fig. 12 the predicted IR-CO(1 \u2212 0) luminosity re-\n\nlation, LIR \u2212 L\u2032CO , for the Bow06.BR model at different redshifts,\ncompared to observational data for different types of galaxies. The\npredicted CO(1 \u2212 0) luminosities for the model galaxies are calculated from their H2 masses as in \u00a74.2.1, using conversion factors\nX = 3.5 for quiescent galaxies and X = 0.5 for bursts. To facilitate the comparison with observations, we here express the CO\nluminosities L\u2032CO in units of K km s\u22121 pc2 , which corresponds to\nexpressing the CO line intensity as a brightness temperature. We\npredict the IR luminosities of the model galaxies using the method\ndescribed in Lacey et al. (2011b) and Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2011) (see\nalso Lacey et al. (2011a)), which uses a physical model for the dust\nextinction at each wavelength to calculate the total amount of stellar radiation absorbed by dust in each galaxy, which is then equal\nto its total IR luminosity. The dust model assumes a two-phase interstellar medium, with star-forming clouds embedded in a diffuse\nmedium. The total mass of dust is predicted by GALFORM selfconsistently from the cold gas mass and metallicity, assuming a\ndust-to-gas ratio which is proportional to the gas metallicity, while\nthe radius of the diffuse dust component is assumed equal to that\nof the star-forming component, whether a quiescent disk or a burst,\nand is also predicted by GALFORM.\nWe show the model predictions in Fig. 12 separately for quiescent (left panel) and starburst galaxies (right panel), where quiescent galaxies are defined as those whose total SFR is dominated\nby SF taking place in the galactic disk (i.e. SFRdisk > SFRburst ).\nSolid lines show the median of the predicted IR-CO relation at different redshifts, while errorbars represent the 10 and 90 percentiles\nof the distributions. To facilitate the comparison between quiescent\nand starburst galaxies, the typical IR luminosity at a CO luminosity\nof 109 h\u22122 K km s\u22121 pc2 is shown as dotted lines in both panels. We see that the separate LIR \u2212 L\u2032CO relations for quiescent\nand starburst galaxies depend only slightly on redshift, but that the\nrelation for starbursts is offset to higher IR luminosities than for\nquiescent galaxies. There are two contributions to this offset in the\nmodel. The first is the different SF laws assumed in starbursts and\nin galaxy disks. By itself, this results in roughly 40 times larger\nIR luminosities at a given H2 mass for starbursts. However, as already described, we also assume a CO-to-H2 conversion factor X\nwhich is 7 times smaller in starbursts, which causes an offset in the\nLIR \u2212L\u2032CO relation in the opposite sense. The combination of these\ntwo effects results in a net offset of roughly a factor of 6 in LIR at\na given L\u2032CO .\nA similar bimodality in the IR-CO luminosity plane has\nalso been inferred observationally by Genzel et al. (2010) and\nCombes et al. (2011). However, these results rely on inferring the\nCO(1-0) luminosities from higher CO transitions when the lowest\ntransitions are not available, which could be significantly uncertain,\nas we discuss below (see also Ivison et al. 2011).\nFor comparison, we also plot in Fig. 12 a selection of observational data. We plot data for local LIRGs and for UV/opticallyselected star-forming galaxies at z \u223c 1 \u2212 2 in the left panel, to\ncompare with the model predictions for quiescent galaxies, and for\nlocal ULIRGs, SMGs at z \u223c 1 \u2212 3, and QSOs at z \u223c 0 \u2212 6 in the\nright panel, to compare with the model predictions for starbursts.\nWe note that there are important uncertainties in the observational\ndata plotted for high redshift (z > 1) objects. For these, the IR luminosities are actually inferred from observations at a single wavelength (24\u03bcm or 850\u03bcm), using an assumed shape for the SED of\ndust emission. (In addition, the Riechers (2011) data on z > 1\nQSOs are actually for FIR, i.e. 40 \u2212 120\u03bcm, luminosities, rather\nthan total IR luminosities.) Furthermore, the CO(1 \u2212 0) luminosities for z > 1 objects are in most cases also not direct measure-\n\n\fEvolution of the HI and H2 gas content\n14\n\nBow06.BR\n\n13\n\nlog(LIR/h-2LO\u2022)\n\n12\n\n11\n\nQSOs follow the same LIR -L\u2032CO relation as starburst galaxies (e.g.\nEvans et al. 2006; Riechers 2011). The model is thus able to explain\nthe LIR -L\u2032CO relation for all objects without needing to include any\nheating of dust by AGN. This also agrees with previous theoretical predictions which concluded that only higher CO transitions\nare affected by the presence of an AGN (e.g. Meijerink et al. 2007;\nObreschkow et al. 2009b).\n\nstarburst\n\nquiescent\nQSOs 1.4<z<3.2\nQSOs 3.2<z<6.4\nSMGs 1<z<3\nSF z=1.2,2.3\nQSOs z<0.15\nULIRGs z=0\nLIRGs z=0\n\nz=0\nz=2\nz=6\n\n5 EVOLUTION OF SCALING RELATIONS OF THE H2\nTO HI RATIO\n\n10\n\n9\n\n8\n6\n\n13\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n7\n-2\n\n8\n\n9\n-1\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n2\n\nlog(L'CO / h K km s pc )\nFigure 12.

To aid the comparison between the quiescent and starburst galaxies, dotted lines show the predicted median IR luminosity at z = 2 for a CO luminosity of 109 h\u22122 K km s\u22121 pc2 . We also\nshow the following observational data: local LIRGs from Gao & Solomon\n(2004) (triangles); local ULIRGs from Solomon et al. (1997) (squares);\nQSOs at z . 0.15 from Scoville et al. (2003), Evans et al. (2006) and\nBertram et al. (2007) (asterisks); star-forming galaxies at z \u2248 1.2 and\nz \u2248 2.3 from Tacconi et al. (2010) and Genzel et al.

Note that most of the observational data on\nthe CO(1\u22120) luminosity at high redshifts are inferred from the luminosities\nof higher CO transitions rather than being directly measured.\n\nments, but are instead inferred from measurements of higher CO\ntransitions J \u2192 J \u2212 1 (usually 4 \u2192 3 or 3 \u2192 2). The conversion\nfrom L\u2032CO (J \u2192 J \u2212 1) to L\u2032CO (1 \u2212 0) is usually done assuming\nthat the brightness temperature of the CO line is independent of the\ntransition J \u2192 J \u2212 1, as would be the case if the CO lines are\nemitted from an optically thick medium in thermal equilibrium at a\nsingle temperature (as appears to be the case in local spiral galaxies). In this case, the luminosity L\u2032CO is independent of the transition studied (Solomon & Vanden Bout 2005). However, recent observations have shown different brightness temperatures for different CO transitions in some high-redshift galaxies (Danielson et al.\n2010; Ivison et al. 2011). As a result, there could be large errors in\nthe CO(1 \u2212 0) luminosities of high-redshift galaxies when they are\ninferred from higher transitions.\nComparing the model predictions for the IR-CO relation with\nthe observational data, we see that the predictions for quiescent\ngalaxies at z = 0 are in broad agreement with the observations\nof nearby LIRGs, while at z = 2 the model predicts partially\nthe location of UV/optically-selected star-forming galaxies. In the\ncase of starburst galaxies, the predicted relation agrees with the observations of low-redshift ULIRGs and high-redshift SMGs, and\nalso with the observations of QSOs at both low and high redshift.\nThe latter is consistent with the suggestion from observations that\n\nOur model predicts that the HI and H2 MFs are characterised by\nradically different evolution with redshift. This implies strong evolution of the H2 /HI ratio. In this section we analyse scaling relations\nof the H2 /HI ratio with galaxy properties and track the evolution of\nthese relations towards high redshift with the aim of understanding\nwhat drives them.\nFig. 13 shows the median H2 /HI ratio as a function of stellar\nmass, cold gas mass and halo mass at different redshifts for the\nBow06.BR model. Errorbars indicate the 10 and 90 percentiles of\nthe model distribution in different mass bins. In the right panel, the\npredictions for satellite and central galaxies are shown separately as\ndashed and solid lines, respectively. For clarity, percentile ranges\nare only shown for central galaxies in this panel. In the case of\nsatellites, the spread around the median is usually larger than it is\nfor central galaxies.\nFig. 13 shows that the H2 /HI ratio correlates strongly with\nstellar and cold gas mass in an approximately power-law fashion.\nThe normalisation of the correlation between H2 /HI and stellar\nmass (left panel of Fig. 13) evolves by two to three orders of magnitude from z = 8 to z = 0 towards smaller values. The evolution\nis milder (only \u2248 1.5 dex) if one focuses instead on the correlation\nwith cold gas mass. Interestingly, the slope of the correlation between the H2 /HI ratio and stellar or cold gas mass hardly evolves.\nThe approximate scalings of the H2 /HI mass ratio against stellar\nand cold gas mass are:\n\nH2 /HI\n\n\u2248\n\n0.01\n\n\u0012\n\nMstellar\n1010 h \u22121 M\u2299\n\n\u00130.8\n\n(1 + z)3.3 ,\n\n(6)\n\nH2 /HI\n\n\u2248\n\n0.09\n\n\u0012\n\nMcold\n1010 h \u22121 M\u2299\n\n\u00130.9\n\n(1 + z)2.4 .\n\n(7)\n\nNote that the relation with Mstellar is only valid up to z = 4. At\nhigher redshifts, the slope of the correlation becomes shallower.\nThe relation with Mcold , however, has the same slope up to z =\n8. The normalisation of the relation of H2 /HI with Mstellar has\na stronger dependence on redshift compared to the relation with\nMcold . However, note that the distribution around the median is\nquite broad, as can be seen from the percentile range plotted in\nFig. 13, so these expressions have be taken just as an illustration of\nthe evolution of the model predictions.\nThe trend between the H2 /HI ratio of galaxies and host halo\nmass depends strongly on whether central or satellite galaxies are\nconsidered. In the case of central galaxies (solid lines in the right\npanel of Fig. 13), there is a correlation between the H2 /HI ratio\nand halo mass that becomes shallower with decreasing redshift in\nintermediate and high mass halos (Mhalo > 5 \u00d7 1011 h\u22121 M\u2299 ).\nThis change in slope is mainly due to the fact that at lower redshift\n(z . 1.5), AGN feedback strongly suppresses SF in central galaxies hosted by halos in this mass range, so that the stellar mass-halo\nmass correlation also becomes shallower and with an increasing\n\n\f14\n\nClaudia del P.

In the right panel, central and satellite galaxies are shown separately as solid and dashed\nlines, respectively. Errorbars are only shown for central galaxies in this panel.\n\nscatter. At high redshift, the stellar mass-halo mass correlation is\ntighter and steeper. In the case of satellite galaxies, the H2 /HI ratio does not vary with host halo mass, but exhibits a characteristic\nvalue that depends on redshift. The lower the redshift, the lower\nthe characteristic H2 /HI ratio for satellites. Nonetheless, the spread\naround the median, in the case of satellite galaxies, is very large, i.e.\nof 1.5 dex at z = 0. The lack of correlation between the H2 /HI ratio and halo mass and the large scatter are due to the dependence of\nthe H2 /HI ratio on galaxy properties (such as stellar and cold gas\nmass) rather than on the host halo mass.\nIn order to disentangle what causes the strong evolution of\nthe H2 /HI ratio with redshift, we study the evolution of the galaxy\nproperties that are directly involved in the calculation of the H2 /HI\nratio. These are the disk size, cold gas mass and stellar mass, which\ntogether determine the hydrostatic pressure of the disk. Fig. 14\nshows the H2 /HI ratio, the half-mass radius (r50 ), the cold gas\nmass, the stellar mass and the midplane hydrostatic pressure of the\ndisk at r50 , as functions of the cold baryonic mass of the galaxy,\nMbar = Mstellar +Mcold . These predictions are for the Bow06.BR\nmodel. Note that we only plot late-type galaxies (selected as those\nwith a bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio B/T < 0.5) as these dominate the cold gas density at any redshift.\nIn general, galaxies display strong evolution in size, moving towards larger radii at lower redshifts. However, this evolution\ntakes place independently of galaxy morphology, implying that the\ngalactic size evolution is caused by size evolution of the host DM\nhalos (i.e. driven by mergers with other DM halos and accretion of\ndark matter onto halos). Note that the evolution in radius is about an\norder of magnitude from z = 6 to z = 0, which easily explains the\nevolution by two order of magnitudes in the H2 /HI ratio (which is\n0.92\n\u221d Pext\n\u221d r\u22121.84 ). By increasing the disk size, the gas density and\npressure decrease and therefore the molecular fraction decreases.\nThe evolution in cold gas mass is mild enough so as not to significantly affect the H2 /HI ratio. Observationally, galaxies of the same\nrest-frame UV luminosity seem to be a factor \u2248 2 \u2212 3 smaller at\nz \u2248 6 than at z \u2248 2 (e.g. Bouwens et al. 2004; Oesch et al. 2010),\nin good agreement with the factor of \u2248 2 \u2212 3 evolution in size\npredicted by the Bow06.BR model (see Lacey et al. 2011b for a\n\ndetailed comparison of sizes predicted by the model with the observed galaxy population).\nFig. 14 shows that the stellar mass of galaxies, at a given\nbaryonic mass, increases with decreasing redshift and, therefore,\nthe corresponding cold gas mass decreases. This drives the hydrostatic pressure to be reduced even further. The midplane hydrostatic pressure evaluated at r50 , Pext (r50 )/kB (bottom panel of\nFig. 14), evolves by more than two orders of magnitude at a given\nMbar over the redshift range plotted. Note that the typical values of\nPext (r50 )/kB predicted at z = 0 are comparable to those reported\nin observations of nearby galaxies, Pext /kB = 103 \u2212 107 cm\u22123 K\n(e.g. Blitz & Rosolowsky 2006; Leroy et al. 2008). At higher redshifts, the values of Pext (r50 ) also overlap with the range in which\nthe \u03a3H2 /\u03a3HI -Pext correlation has been constrained observationally at z = 0.\nThe evolution in galactic size is therefore the main factor responsible for the predicted evolution in the H2 /HI ratio at fixed\nbaryonic mass in the model, with a minor contribution from other\nproperties which also contribute to determining this quantity (i.e.\ncold gas and stellar mass).\n\n6 COSMIC EVOLUTION OF THE ATOMIC AND\nMOLECULAR GAS DENSITIES\nThe H2 /HI ratio depends strongly on galaxy properties and redshift.\nIn this section we present predictions for the evolution of the global\ndensity of HI and H2 .\nThe top panel of Fig. 15 shows the evolution of the global\ncomoving mean density of all forms of hydrogen (solid line), HI\n(dashed line) and H2 (dot-dashed line), in units of the critical density at z = 0, \u03c1/\u03c1c,z=0 .

If the reported values of \u03c1HI and \u03c1H2 include the contribution from helium, then we\nsubtract this when plotting the data.\nThe model predicts local universe gas densities in good agreement with the observed ones, which is expected from the good\nagreement with the HI MF and CO(1 \u2212 0) LF.

Solid\nlines show the medians of the distributions, while errorbars show the 10 and\n90 percentiles, and for clarity are plotted only for three different redshifts.\n\nthe model predicts \u03c1HI in good agreement with the observed density of HI inferred from damped-Ly\u03b1 systems (DLAs). Note that\nin our model, by definition, the HI is attached to galaxies (see \u00a72).\nHowever, recent simulations by Faucher-Gigu\u00e8re & Kere\u0161 (2011),\nAltay et al. (2010) and Fumagalli et al. (2011) suggest that DLAs\nmight not correspond exclusively to HI gas attached to galaxies,\nbut also to HI clumps formed during the rapid accretion of cold\ngas (e.g. Binney 1977; Haehnelt et al. 1998). Thus, the comparison\nbetween our predictions of \u03c1HI and the values inferred from observations from DLAs has to be considered with caution in mind.\nAt z = 0 the HI mass density is much larger than that in H2 ,\ndue to the low molecular fractions in extended, low pressure galactic disks. At z \u2248 2, where galactic disks are characterised by larger\npressure and therefore, higher molecular fractions, the density of\nH2 slightly exceeds that of HI. This H2 domination extends up to\nz \u2248 5, above which HI again becomes the principle form of neutral\nhydrogen. These transitions are clearly seen in the bottom panel of\nFig. 15, where the evolution of the HI/H, H2 /H and H2 /HI global\nratios are shown.

This is in better agreement with the value predicted by Obreschkow & Rawlings (2009), but is still \u223c 1.5 times\nlower. We interpret this difference as being due to the postprocessing applied by Obreschkow et al. rather than the self-consistent calculation adopted here. We have already showed that postprocessing\ncan lead to answers which differ substantially from the self consistent approach (see Fig 2). We can summarise the predicted evolution of the H2 /HI global ratio, \u03c1H2 /\u03c1HI , as being characterised by\nthree stages,\n\n-4.0\n\n\u03c1H2 /\u03c1HI\n\n-4.5\n\n\u2248\n\n\u2248\n\n\u2248\n\n-5.0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\nz\n\n6\n\n-2.5\ntotal H2\nlog(Mhalo)<10.0\n10<log(Mhalo)<11\n11<log(Mhalo)<12\nlog(Mhalo)>12\n\nlog(\u03c1/\u03c1c,z=0)\n\n-3.0\n\n-3.5\n\n-4.0\n\n-4.5\n\n-5.0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\nz\n\n6\n\nFigure 16.

Symbols\ncorrespond to different observations as labelled in Fig. 15.\n\nat z \u2248 3.5. The predicted evolution of the H2 /HI global ratio differs greatly from the theoretical predictions reported previously by\nObreschkow & Rawlings (2009, dotted line in the bottom panel of\nFig. 15) and Power et al. (2010), which were obtained from postprocessed semi-analytic models (see \u00a72.4). These authors reported\na monotonic increase of the H2 /HI ratio with redshift, even up to\nglobal ratios of H2 /HI\u2248 10. This difference with our results is due\nin part to resolution effects, since these papers used DM halos extracted from the Millennium simulation (see \u00a72.1), and therefore\nonly sample haloes with Mhalo > 1010 h\u22121 M\u2299 at all redshifts.\nConsequently, these calculations were not able to resolve the galaxies that dominate the HI global density at high redshift, inferring\nan artificially high global H2 /HI ratio. We can confirm this assertion if we fix the halo mass resolution in the Bow06.BR model at\nMhalo = 1010 h\u22121 M\u2299 , whereupon a global ratio of H2 /HI\u2248 7 is\n\n0.13 (1 + z)1.7\n\nfor\n\nz.2\n\n0.6\n\nfor\n\n2.z.4\n\n3.7 (1 + z)\u22120.7\n\nfor\n\nz & 4.\n\n0.45 (1 + z)\n\n(8)\n\nFig. 16 shows the contribution to \u03c1HI (top panel) and \u03c1H2 (bottom panel) from halos of different mass. The overall evolution of\n\u03c1HI is always dominated by low and intermediate mass halos with\nMhalo < 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 . At z > 1, the contribution from halos\nwith masses of 1011 h\u22121 M\u2299 < Mhalo < 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 quickly\ndrops, and at z > 4 the same happens with halos in the mass range\n1010 h\u22121 M\u2299 < Mhalo < 1011 h\u22121 M\u2299 . At higher redshifts, low\nmass halos become the primary hosts of HI mass. In contrast, the\nevolution of \u03c1H2 is always dominated by intermediate and high\nmass halos with MDM > 1011 h\u22121 M\u2299 , supporting our interpretation of the evolution of the HI and H2 MFs. This suggests that\nthe weak clustering of HI galaxies reported by Meyer et al. (2007)\nand Basilakos et al. (2007) is mainly due to the fact that HI-selected\ngalaxies are preferentially found in low mass halos, while in more\nmassive halos the hydrogen content of galaxies has a larger contribution from H2 .\nNote that the evolution of \u03c1HI and \u03c1H2 with redshift is weaker\nthan the evolution of the SFR density, \u03c1SFR . As L11 reported, \u03c1SFR\nincreases by a factor of \u2248 15 from z = 0 to z = 3 (the predicted\npeak of the SF activity). On the other hand, \u03c1H2 evolves by a factor\nof \u2248 7 from z = 0 to z = 3 (where the H2 density peaks), while\n\u03c1HI evolves weakly, decreasing by a factor only of 1.5 from z = 0\nto z = 5. The difference in the redshift evolution between \u03c1H2 and\n\u03c1SFR is due to the contribution from starbursts to the latter at z > 2,\nthat drops quickly at lower redshifts. This leads to a larger decrease\nin the global \u03c1SFR compared to \u03c1H2 . We remind the reader that\nwe assume different SF laws for starbursts and quiescent SF, and\ntherefore, by construction, different gas depletion timescales (see\n\u00a72.3).\nIn order to gain an impression of how much the predicted\nglobal density evolution can change with the modelling of SF,\nFig. 17 shows the global density evolution of the neutral H, HI and\nH2 for the Bau05.BR, Bau05.KMT, Bow06.BR and Bow06.KMT\nmodels. The former three models predict very similar global density evolution of HI at z < 4, while at higher redshifts the\nBau05.KMT model predicts larger global densities mainly due to\nthe metallicity dependence of the H2 /HI ratio in the KMT SF law\n(see Eq. 4) and the typically lower gas metallicities in high redshift\ngalaxies. However, the Bow06.KMT model predicts a global density of HI offset by a factor of 4 with respect to the observational\nestimates and the other models over the whole redshift range. This\nis caused by the large overprediction of the number density of intermediate HI mass galaxies by this model (Fig. 6). In the case of the\nglobal density of H2 , all the models predict a similar redshift peak\nat z \u2248 3 \u2212 4, but with an offset in the maximum density attained.\n\n\fEvolution of the HI and H2 gas content\n-2.5\n\nlog(\u03c1H/\u03c1c,z=0)\n\n-3.0\n\n-3.5\nBow06.BR\nBow06.KMT\n-4.0\n\nBau05.BR\nBau05.KMT\n\nH\n\n-2.5\n\nlog(\u03c1HI/\u03c1c,z=0)\n\n-3.0\n\n-3.5\n\n-4.0\n\nHI\n-2.5\n\nlog(\u03c1H2/\u03c1c,z=0)\n\n-3.0\n\n-3.5\n\n-4.0\n\nH2\n\n-4.5\n0\n\n2\n\n4\nz\n\n6\n\n8\n\nFigure 17.

We use the extension of the GALFORM\nsemi-analytic model implemented by Lagos et al. (2010, L11), in\nwhich the neutral hydrogen in the ISM of galaxies is split into its\natomic and molecular components. To do that we have used either the empirical correlation of Blitz & Roslowsky (2006, BR),\nbetween the H2 /HI ratio and the hydrostatic pressure of the disk\nor the formalism of Krumholz et al. (2009, KMT) of molecule\nformation on dust grains balanced by UV dissociation. We assume that the SFR depends directly on the H2 content of galax-\n\n17\n\nies, as suggested by observational results for nearby galaxies (e.g.\nWong & Blitz 2002; Solomon & Vanden Bout 2005; Bigiel et al.\n2008; Schruba et al. 2010). We do not change any other model parameter, so as to isolate the consequences of changing the SF law\non the model predictions.\nWe study the evolution of HI and H2 predicted by two models, those of Baugh et al. (2005, Bau05) and Bower et al. (2006,\nBow06), after applying the BR or the KMT SF law prescriptions.\nWhen applying the BR SF law, we find that the Bau05 and the\nBow06 models predict a present-day HI MF in broad agreement\nwith observations by Zwaan et al. (2005) and Martin et al. (2010),\nand a relation between the H2 /HI ratio and stellar and cold gas mass\nin broad agreement with Leroy et al. (2008). When applying the\nKMT SF law, the two models fail to predict the observed HI MF at\nz = 0. Moreover, L11 find that the Bau05 model fails to predict the\nobserved K-band LF at z > 0.5, regardless of the SF law assumed.\nHence, we select as our best model that of Bow06 with the BR\nSF law applied (Bow06.BR). This model predicts local Universe\nestimates of the HI and H2 MFs, scaling relations of the H2 /HI,\nMH2 /Mstellar and MHI /Mstellar ratios with galaxy properties, and\nalso the IR-CO luminosity relation in reasonable agreement with\nobservations, but also gives good agreement with stellar masses,\noptical LFs, gas-to-luminosity ratios, among others (see L11 for a\nfull description of the predictions of the GALFORM model when\nchanging the SF law and Fanidakis et al. 2010 for predictions of\nthis model for the AGN population). We show that the new SF law\napplied is a key model component to reproduce the local HI MF at\nintermediate and low HI masses given that it reduces SF and, therefore, SNe feedback, allowing the survival of larger gas reservoirs.\nUsing the Bow06.BR model, we can predict the evolution of\nthe HI and H2 MFs. We find that the evolution of HI is characterised by a monotonic increase in the number density of massive\ngalaxies with decreasing redshift. For H2 , the number density of\nmassive galaxies increases from z = 8 to z = 4, followed by very\nmild evolution down to z = 2. At z < 2, the number density in\nthis range drops quickly. These radical differences in the HI and\nH2 MF evolution are due to the strong evolution in the H2 /HI ratio with redshift, due to the dependence on galaxy properties. We\nalso present predictions for the HI mass-stellar mass and HI massSFR relations, and for the cumulative HI mass density of stacked\nsamples of galaxies selected by stellar mass or SFR at different redshifts, which is relevant to the first observations of HI expected at\nhigh redshift.\nAt a given redshift, the H2 /HI ratio strongly depends on the\nstellar and cold gas masses. The normalisation of the correlation\nevolves strongly with redshift, increasing by two orders of magnitude from z = 0 up to z = 8, in contrast with the very mild evolution in the slope of the correlations. We also find that the H2 /HI\nratio correlates with halo mass only for central galaxies, where the\nslope and normalization of the correlation depends on redshift. For\nsatellite galaxies, no correlation with the host halo mass is found,\nwhich is a result of the weak correlation between satellite galaxy\nproperties and their host halo mass. We find that the main mechanism driving the evolution of the amplitude of the correlation between the H2 /HI ratio and stellar and cold gas mass, and with halo\nmass in the case of central galaxies, is the size evolution of galactic\ndisks. Lower-redshift galaxies are roughly an order of magnitude\nlarger than z = 8 galaxies with the same baryonic mass (cold gas\nand stellar mass).\nFinally, we studied the cosmic density evolution of HI and H2 ,\nand find that the former is characterised by very mild evolution with\nredshift, in agreement with observations of DLAs (e.g. P\u00e9roux et al.\n\n\f18\n\nClaudia del P. Lagos\n\n2003; Noterdaeme et al. 2009), while the density of H2 increases\nby a factor of 7 from z \u2248 0 to z \u2248 3. We also predict that H2\nslightly dominates over the HI content of the universe between z \u2248\n2 \u2212 4 (with a peak of \u03c1H2 /\u03c1HI \u2248 1.2 at z \u2248 3.5), and that it is\npreferentially found in intermediate mass DM halos. On the other\nhand, we find that the HI is mainly contained in low mass halos. The\nglobal H2 /HI density ratio evolution with redshift is characterised\nby a rapid increase from z = 0 to z = 2 as \u03c1H2 /\u03c1HI \u221d (1 + z)1.7 ,\nfollowed by a slow increase at 2 < z < 4 as \u03c1H2 /\u03c1HI \u221d (1 +\nz)0.6 , to finally decrease slowly with increasing redshift at z > 4\nas \u03c1H2 /\u03c1HI \u221d (1 + z)\u22120.7 . We conclude that previous studies\n(Obreschkow & Rawlings 2009; Power et al. 2010) overestimated\nthis evolution due in part to halo mass resolution effects, as the\ngalaxies which dominate the HI density at z & 2 were not resolved\nin these calculations.\nThe results of this paper suggest radically different evolution\nof the cosmic densities of HI and H2 , as well as a strong evolution in the H2 /HI ratio in galaxies. The next generation of radio\nand submm telescopes (such as ASKAP, MeerKAT, SKA, LMT\nand ALMA) will reveal the neutral gas content of the Universe and\ngalaxies up to very high-redshifts, and will be able to test the predictions made here.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Richard Bower, Ian Smail, Houjun Mo, Nicolas Tejos,\nGabriel Altay, Estelle Bayet and Padeli Papadopoulos for useful\ncomments and discussions, and Rachael Livermore and Matthew\nBothwell for providing the observational data of the IR-CO relation and the HI and H2 scaling relations, respectively.
