In the usual scenario where sparticles around the weak scale keep it naturally small,\nthis process implies an important constraint on the maximal reheating temperature, possibly\nsaturated if such gravitinos are all observed Dark Matter (DM). If instead sparticles exist much\nabove the weak scale, gravitino production is one of their very few experimental implications\nthat survive.\nThe gravitino production thermal rate was previously computed in [1, 2] at leading order\nin the gauge couplings g3 (and g2 , gY in [3]; we will add effects due the top Yukawa coupling,\nwhich also has a sizeable value). This roughly amounts to compute 2 \u2192 2 scatterings (like\ngluon + gluon \u2192 gluon \u2192 gluino + gravitino), with thermal effects ignored everywhere expect\nin the propagator of the virtual intermediate gluon: a massless gluon exchanged in the t-channel\ngives an infinite cross-section because it mediates a long-range Coulomb-like force; the resulting\nlogarithmic divergence is cut off by the thermal mass of the gluon, m \u223c gT , leaving a ln T /m.\nThe explicit expression for the number of scatterings per space-time volume, at leading order\nin the dominant QCD gauge coupling, was found to be [2, 3]1\n!\nT6\nM32\n320.\n1.2\n\u03b3scattering = 3 2 1 +\nf (g3 ),\nf (g3) = 2 g32 ln\n(1.1)\n2\n3m3/2\n\u03c0\ng3\n2\u03c0 M\u0304Pl\nwhere M\u0304Pl = 2.4 1018 GeV is the reduced Planck mass, M3 is gluino mass and m3/2 is the\ngravitino mass. This production rate unphysically decreases for g3 >\n\u223c 0.7 becoming negative for\n>\ng3 \u223c 1.2. Fig. 1 shows that the physical value, g3 \u2248 0.85 at T \u223c 1010 GeV, lies in the region\nwhere the leading-order rate function f (g3 ) (dashed line) is unreliable. Fig. 1 also illustrates\nour final result (to be precisely described in section 4.2): f will be replaced by the continuous\nlines, which agree with the leading order result at g \u223c m/T \u226a 1 and differ at g \u223c 1.\nLet us now explain why the leading-order approximation in (1.1) starts to be inadequate\nalready at g \u223c 0.7. In thermal field theory higher order corrections are usually suppressed by\ng/\u03c0: somewhat worse than the usual expansion coefficient (g/\u03c0)2 at T = 0, but still typically\ngood enough at g \u223c 0.7. Na\u0131\u0308ve power counting fails (without signaling a breaking of the\nperturbative expansion) when some new phenomenon only starts entering at higher orders, and\nthis is what happens in the case of gravitino production: a new simpler process gives corrections\nof relative order (g\u03c0)2 . The gravitino couples to two particles with different thermal masses:\ngluon/gluino, and quark/squark. Since thermal masses grow like T , this gives rise to a new\nprocess with a rate growing like T 6 : gravitino production via decays, such as gluon \u2192 gluino\n+ gravitino, whose rate can be crudely estimated as\n\u03b3decay\n\nm4 T 2\ng4 T 6\nm T 3\u0393\n\u223c 3 2 \u223c 3 2\n\u223c\nT \u03c02\n\u03c0 M\u0304Pl\n\u03c0 M\u0304Pl\n\n(1.2)\n\n2\nIndeed \u03b3decay is of course proportional to the decay rate at rest \u0393 \u223c m3 /\u03c0 M\u0304Pl\n; which is slowed\n3\ndown by the Lorentz dilatation m/T factor; the T takes care of dimensions, and less \u03c0 are\npresent at the denominator because a 1 \u2192 2 decay involves less particles than a 2 \u2192 2 scattering. So, despite being higher order in g, the decay rate can be enhanced by a phase space factor\n1\n\nSince we will adopt a different technique, we cannot resolve the minor disagreement between the results\nof [2] and [3]. Notice also that, for later convenience, in eq. (1.1) we explicitly show the power \u03c0 5 (following\nfrom the phase space for scattering processes, and dictated by na\u0131\u0308ve dimensional analysis), which is explicitly\npresent in [1] and partially hidden in numerical coefficients in [2].\n\n2\n\n\f25\n\nRate functions\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\nsmall g\n5\nU(1)\n\nSU(2)\n\nSU(3)\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n1.5\nThermal vector mass, m / T\n\n2\n\nFigure 1: Functions f3 , f2 and f1 that, as summarized in section 4.2, describe our result for\nthe gravitino production rate from SU(3)c (upper continuous curve, in red), SU(2)L (middle\ncontinuous curve, in blue), U(1)Y (lower continuous curve, in green) gauge interactions. The\narrows indicate the MSSM values of the thermal mass at T \u223c 109 GeV. The lower dashed curve\nshows the result from [2], which agrees with our result in the limit of small gauge coupling, and\nbehaves unphysically for relevant O(1) values of the MSSM gauge couplings.\n\u03c0 2 . Subsequent higher order corrections should be suppressed by the usual g/\u03c0 factors. Our\ngoal is including such enhanced higher order terms, and this finite-temperature computation is\npractically feasible because a decay is a simple enough process.\nSo far we explained the physical picture in a simple intuitive way. A more precise technical\nlanguage is necessary to present how we will proceed. To get the gravitino production rate\nwe actually compute the imaginary part of the gravitino propagator in the thermal plasma.\nThermal effects distort the dispersion relations E(k) of gluons, gluinos, quarks, squarks by i)\nadding a thermal mass E 2 = k 2 + m2 (k) to the modes already existing at zero temperature; ii)\nby introducing new collective excitations (gluons with longitudinal polarization, gluinos with\n'wrong' helicity, ...) with their own dispersion relation; iii) beyond the two poles mentioned\nabove, the spectral densities of particles in a thermal plasma also develop a 'continuum' contribution, that can be thought of as a parton-like distribution, with a continuum range of masses.\nPhysically it arises because particles can exchange energy with the plasma.\nIn previous works [2, 3] the gluon thermal mass was taken into account to regulate infrared divergences encountered in scattering rates, and the contribution of the gluon 'continuum'\nwas computed using a standard technique introduced in axion computations [4], that allows to\nextract the rate at leading order in g. This was achieved by introducing an arbitrary splitting\nscale k that obeys gT \u226a k \u226a T .\nWe will not use this technique: because its validity is doubtful for g3 \u2248 0.85, and because we\nactually want to include the enhanced higher order terms, taking into account that a gravitino\n(unlike an axion) couples to two particles with different thermal masses. We will instead\ncompute the decay diagram (D in fig. 2) using resummed finite-temperature propagators for\n3\n\n\fD\n\nS1\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u03a8\n\n\u03a8\n\nS2\n\nS3\n\u03bb\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u03a8\n\n\u03a8\n\n\u03a8\n\ng\n\u03a8\n\n\u03bb\n\ng\n\ng\n\n\u03a8\n\n\u03bb\n\ng\ng\n\n\u03a8\n\ng\n\ng\n\nFigure 2: Some Feynman diagrams that contribute to the imaginary part of the gravitino propagator.

The perturbative expansion of this diagram D contains the\ntwo-loop diagrams in fig. 3: their imaginary parts correspond to well-defined combinations of\nscattering processes, as dictated by cutting rules. This fixes how scatterings must be subtracted\nin order to avoid overcountings of effects already described by thermal masses via diagram D.\nIn section 2 we compute the subtracted scattering rates, in section 4 we compute the gravitino\nproduction rate via 'decay', and in section 5 we add the rate due to the top quark Yukawa\ncoupling.\nIn section 6 we sum these effects and compute the gravitino abundance writing a set of\nBoltzmann equations that describe the reheating process, previously approximated assuming a\nmaximal temperature equal to the reheating temperature TRH . Our results are summarized in\nthe conclusions, section 7.\nIn the passing we address some issues related to finite-temperature and to supersymmetry.\nIn section 3 we list explicit values for thermal masses for all particles and sparticles, noticing\nthat they obey some supersymmetric relation.

The visible sector is thermalized, while the gravitino is not, since its coupling to\nthe MSSM plasma is weak. According to the general formalism of thermal field theory [5],\nthe production rate of such a weakly interacting fermion is related to the imaginary part of its\npropagator \u03a0 as\nZ\nZ\nd3 p\ndN\n~\n= \u22122 dP fF (E) Im \u03a0 = dP~ \u03a0< (P ),\ndP~ \u2261\n.\n(2.1)\n\u03b3=\ndV dt\n2E(2\u03c0)3\nHere \u03a0< is the non time-ordered gravitino propagator summed over its polarizations i.e. traced\nwith the gravitino polarization tensor \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd (appendix A gives explicit expressions):\n\u03a0< (P ) =\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\n\u03bd\n\u03bc\nTr\n\u03a0\n(P\n)hS\n(P\n)\nS\u0304\n(\u2212P\n)i\n\u03bc\u03bd\nT\n2\n4M\u0304Pl\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere h* * * iT denotes thermal average. We employ \u03a0< because it gives slightly cleaner formulae\n\u22121\n, and to all orders\nthan Im \u03a0. Eq. (2.1) is valid at leading order in the gravitino coupling M\u0304Pl\nin the MSSM couplings, gY,2,3 and \u03bbt . Extracting predictions from (2.1) is limited only by our\nability to evaluate (2.2).\nThermal field theory cutting rules allow to see that, at leading order in the MSSM couplings,\neq. (2.1) is equivalent to summing rates for the various tree-level processes that lead to gravitino\nproduction. At tree level this formalism is more cumbersome than a direct computation of\nproduction rates. However, in this paper we want to take into account finite temperature\ncorrections to the MSSM particle propagators arising at one loop level: eq. (2.1) becomes\n5\n\n\fmore convenient because it cleanly dictates how one must resolve ambiguities encountered in\nscattering computations that arise because Lorentz invariance is broken by the thermal plasma.\nFig. 2 shows some main Feynman diagrams that contribute to Im \u03a0. What we actually\ncompute in this paper is the first one-loop diagram 'D', using the Feynman gauge resummed\nfinite-temperature propagators for the gluon and gluino in the loop. Therefore it describes a\nsum of an infinite number of multi-loop diagrams: the lowest-order ones are shown in fig. 3.\nResummation is needed because thermal effect drastically change the gluon and gluino propagators, in particular opening a phase space for decays, such as g \u2192 \u03bb\u03a8 and/or \u03bb \u2192 g\u03a8. Clearly\ndiagram D contains this decay process. However, by cutting fig. 3, one sees that diagram D\nalso describes some of the 2 \u2192 2 scattering processes computed in previous analyses [2]. Therefore, before starting the computation, we clarify this issue showing how the total gravitino\nproduction rate is obtained.\nThe total scattering rate is the sum of various 2 \u2192 2 processes A, B, C,. . . , listed in table 1.\nEach process is the modulus squared of the sum of a few amplitudes, corresponding to the\nsingle Feynman diagrams, that we label as s, t, u, x:\n\u03b3scattering = |As + At + Au + Ax |2 + |Bs + Bt + Bu + Bx |2 + * * * .\nThis notation indicates that often 4 diagrams contribute to a given process: 3 diagrams are\ngenerated by s, t and u-channel exchange of some particle among two vertices (g3 and 1/MPl ),\nand a fourth diagram arises from a quartic supergravity vertex with coupling g/MPl. Fig. 4\nand 5 show concrete examples of the 4 diagrams that contribute to gg \u2192 \u03a8\u03bb and to g\u03bb \u2192 \u03a8g\nscatterings, respectively. The latter rate is logarithmically infra-red (IR) divergent, because\ndiagram Bt is mediated by t-channel gluon exchange, that describes a Coulomb-like scattering.\nThe main result can be obtained by careful visual inspection of cutting rules: diagram D\ndescribes the sum |As |2 + |At |2 + |Au |2 + |Bs |2 + |Bt |2 + |Bu |2 + * * * of the modulus squared\nof all 2 \u2192 2 diagrams that contain the gauge coupling g3 . 2 \u2192 2 scattering rates generated\nby supergravity quartic vertices are instead described by diagrams like S3 in fig. 2. Some cuts\nof the two loop diagrams like S1 and S2 describe the interference terms among the various\nFeynman diagrams. (Notice that the imaginary part of a single two-loop diagram can describe\ncontributions to different scattering processes). Other cuts of these diagrams describe one loop\ncorrections to the gravitino vertices, that do not give any leading order contribution if thermal\nmasses are neglected. Thermal masses open a phase space for 1 \u2192 2 processes (we can neglect\nthe decay rate generated by zero-temperature masses m, since we are interested in T \u226b m),\nand we will later argue that we can still neglect thermal corrections to the gravitino vertex.\nIn conclusion, the total gravitino production rate due to gauge couplings will be computed\nas\n\u03b3 = \u03b3D + \u03b3Ssub ,\n(2.3)\nthe sum of diagram D (that describes decay plus modulus squared of many single 2 \u2192 2\ndiagrams) plus the set of remaining 2 \u2192 2 rates, obtained by subtracting from the total\nscattering rate \u03b3S the effects already included in \u03b3D . Explicit results for \u03b3D and for \u03b3Ssub will be\ngiven in eq. (4.6) and eq. (2.6) respectively, and the conclusions will describe how to use them.\nBefore proceeding to actual computations, we have to clarify the issues of gravitino coupling\nand gravitino gauge invariance. We are interested in T \u226b m, where m denotes sparticle or\ngravitino masses: gravitino \u2194 Goldstino equivalence (appendix A) means that at leading order\nin m/T the massive gravitino field \u03a8\u03bc can be replaced with two massless field: a massless\ngravitino \u03c8 coupled to the supercurrent S\u03bc (given in eq.

While the total rate is\ngauge independent (vectors have SU(3)c \u2297 SU(2)L \u2297 U(1)Y gauge invariance; the computation\nof \u03b3(\u03c8\u03bc ) also involves gravitino gauge invariance), its splitting in resummed and not-resummed\ncontributions is not. We are resumming a well-defined class of effects, but we cannot systematically include all the effects up to a given order in g: therefore our result has a residual\ngauge-dependence, of relative order g 2 /\u03c0 2 , due to partial inclusion of higher-order terms. To\nmake the computation feasible, we choose for vectors the Feynman gauge, and for the massless\ngravitino \u03c8\u03bc the gauge where its propagator and polarization tensor does not involve terms\ncontaining P\u03bc or P\u03bd , eq.

Of course, the same gauge is used for computing both the\nresummed diagram D and the subtracted scattering rates.\nTable 1 gives explicit values for the subtracted massless gravitino and Goldstino scattering\nrates due to gauge interactions. It is important to notice that, unlike the total rate, the\nsubtracted rates are infra-red convergent: no 1/t factors appear because all divergent Coloumblike scatterings, like |Bt |2 , are included in diagram D, that we compute using thermal masses\nthat provide the physical cut-off. Unlike in the conventional technique [4] employed in [2, 3], our\ntechnique does not need to introduce an arbitrary splitting scale k\u2217 that satisfies the problematic\nconditions gT \u226a k\u2217 \u226a T in order to control infra-red divergences. Some contributions to\n7\n\n\fsubtracted scattering rates turn out to be negative, but the total rate will be positive and\ndominated by diagram D. In Feynman gauge, rates for the processes A and B (the ones that\ninvolve two vectors) actually are the sum of scatterings\nP \u2217involving two vectors (four diagrams,\ncomputed with the Feynman polarization tensor\n\u01eb\u03bc \u01eb\u03bd = \u2212\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd ) plus scatterings containing\ntwo ghosts (one diagram, negative |A |2 ).\nA curious fact happens. Despite the fact that the massless gravitino \u03c8 and the Goldstino\n\u03c7 have different couplings (in particular the Goldstino has no coupling to quark/squark, and\nconsequently a reduced set of Feynman diagrams), the differential production cross sections\nfor these two particles are the same, process by process, up to the universal factor MN2 /3m23/2 ,\nwhere M1,2,3 are the gaugino masses. We don't know if there is a simple generic reason behind\nthis equality. The second reason for choosing the gravitino projector of eq. (2.5) is that it\nrespects this equality also for subtracted scattering rates.\nSubtracted rates for processes C, D, E, G, I vanish, and looking at Goldstinos one can easily\nunderstand why: a single Goldstino diagram contributes, such that no interference terms exist.\nThis is not the case for scatterings H and J, where a second Goldstino diagram contributes,\ngenerated by the quartic Goldstino coupling in eq. (A.29). (This extra coupling is not present\nfor the ghost scatterings in A and B analogous to H and J, as we employ a non-supersymmetric\ngauge without ghostinos). In case of scattering F the subtracted rate vanishes because proportional to s + t + u = 0. A 1/2! factor must be included for the A and F processes that have\nequal initial state particles, and a factor 2 for C, D, G, H that can occur with particles and\nwith anti-particles.

It is performed analytically in the more explicit results in appendices B\nand C\nThe key parameters are 'thermal masses' of order m \u223c gT .

Squared thermal masses for gauginos,\nhiggsinos, quarks and leptons are a factor 2 smaller, as summarized in (3.2).\nWe followed the standard convention for thermal masses. Let us recall how they parameterize thermal dispersion relations \u03c9(k) where \u03c9 and k are the energy and momentum with respect\nto the plasma rest frame. Scalar thermal masses m2 correspond to the relativistic dispersion\nrelation \u03c9 2 = k 2 + m2 , see eq. (3.1). For fermions the thermal mass m tells the energy at rest of\nparticle and hole (or 'plasmon') excitations, \u03c9(k = 0) = m, while at large momentum the hole\ndisappears3 and particles have \u03c9 2 (k \u226b T ) \u2243 k 2 + 2m2 . For vectors the thermal mass m tells\nthe dispersion relation of transverse polarizations at large momentum, \u03c9 2 (k \u226b T ) \u2243 k 2 + m2 ,\nwhile at rest both transverse and longitudinal polarizations have energy \u03c9 2 (k = 0) = 2m2 /3.\nTherefore, despite the misleading conventional factors 2, eq. (3.2) means that within each\nmultiplet, vector or chiral, thermal effects at k \u226b T modify in the same way the dispersion\nrelation of its bosonic and of its fermionic components. This likely is a consequence of the\neikonal theorem, that tells that gauge interactions with soft vectors do not depend on the\nparticle spin but only on its gauge current (thermal masses physically describe the kinetic\nenergy that a particle acquires due to scatterings with the thermal plasma). Fig. 6 shows the\ndispersion relations \u03c9(k) of the particles within chiral and vector multiplets. Particles and\nsparticles have similar dispersion relations, reducing the phase space for gravitino production\nvia decays.\n\n3.2\n\nFull one loop thermal effects\n\nThe HTL approximation holds at momenta and energies k, \u03c9 \u226a T , correctly describing thermal effects that arise at k, \u03c9 \u223c gT if g \u226a 1. However, the physically relevant values of gauge\ncouplings (especially the strong coupling) are not small enough to justify the use of the HTL\napproximation. We therefore use the full one-loop thermal and quantum corrections to propagators of scalars, fermions and vectors. Explicit expressions are collected in appendices B and C\n3\n\nMore precisely, its residue at the pole is exponentially suppressed by k 2 /m2 . The fact that residues Z(k) are\nnot constant is one reason why computing the imaginary part of the gravitino propagator in terms of particle\nand sparticle spectral densities is a better formalism than directly computing the gravitino production rate: it\nprecisely dictates how all these non-relativistic factors must be taken into account.\n\n10\n\n\fHTL limit, m ` T\n4\n\nm = T\n4\n\nFermion\n\n2\n\n\u03a9/m\n\n\u03a9/m\n\n2\n\nFermion\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\nFermion hole\n\n-4\n0\n\n1\n\n2\nk /m\n\nFermion hole\n\n-4\n3\n\n4\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\nk /m\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFigure 7: Spectral density of a massless fermion in a thermal plasma, plotted in HTL approximation (g \u226a 1, i.e. thermal mass m \u223c gT \u226a T ) and beyond.

In the g \u2192 0 limit particles (and quasi-particles such as fermion 'holes')\nhave an infinitesimal width: their dispersion relations are plotted as thin lines in fig. 7a. For\nfinite g they get a finite width \u0393 (both from T = 0 quantum effects and from thermal effects),\nsuch that their spectral density gets smeared acquiring the usual bell-like shape. This is why\na continuum appears also above the light cone in fig. 7b. A well known problem encountered\nin thermal computations is that sometimes thermal effects give \u0393 < 0. We therefore included\nthe T = 0 contribution, finding that the total \u0393 is positive for scalars and fermions. This cure\ndoes not work for vectors, because the T = 0 contribution to their \u0393 can itself be negative\ndepending on the gauge choice, see eq. (B.3a). We therefore think that the negativity of \u0393 is\nnot related to higher-order subtleties in the thermal expansion, but just to gauge invariance.\nIt should not affect computations of physical gauge-invariant quantities, provided that one can\ndo an exact computation up to some order in the perturbative expansion. The only trouble\nis that in practice it is difficult to achieve this in finite temperature computations. In view of\nthis situation, since the would-be poles are anyhow reasonably narrow for the physical values\n\n11\n\n\fof the coupling that enter our computation, we use for them the HTL approximation4 . Notice\nthat the HTL approximation correctly describes the position of the poles (i.e. the dispersion\nrelations) even at large k >\n\u223c T : poles lie close to the light-cone, |\u03c9| \u2248 k, even if g \u223c 1 [10].\nThe new effect important for our purposes arises at |\u03c9| < k, i.e. 'below the light cone'.\nQuantum effects do not give any contribution to spectral densities here (and more generally\nbelow the threshold for zero-temperature decays), and the purely thermal contribution is not\nproblematic. Even in HTL approximation, thermal effects give non zero spectral densities below\nthe light cone: this describes 'Landau damping' i.e. the fact that particles exchange energy with\nthe thermal plasma. However the HTL approximation cannot be applied at k \u223c T (a region\nrelevant for us, since g \u223c 1), and indeed it misses one key physical fact: at k \u226b T spectral\ndensities get suppressed by an exponential Boltzmann factor. Indeed the thermally averaged\ncoupling of a particle with large momentum k \u226b T is small, since very few of the particles in the\nplasma have the large momentum demanded by energy-momentum conservation. This Boltzmann suppression of the spectral density below the light cone is the main difference between\nfig. 7a (HTL approximation) and fig. 7b (full one loop), and makes the gravitino production\nrate about 50% smaller than what one would find by applying the HTL approximation at all\nmomenta, outside its domain of validity p \u226a T .\n\n3.3\n\nVector and gaugino propagators\n\nWe are now going to present how spectral densities are practically used. We need the resummed propagators for the vector with four-momentum K = (k0 , k) and the gaugino with\nfour-momentum Q = (q0 , q) in the loop. We employ non-time ordered propagators (as they\nallow slightly cleaner formulae than imaginary parts of propagators), denoted with a < in the\nnotation of [5] that we follow. Thermally resummed propagators are denoted with a \u2217 : they\nare (see appendices B, C for more details)\n\u0014\n\u0015\nfF (q0 )\n\u2217 <\n(\u03b30 \u2212 \u03b3 * q\u0302)\u03c1+ (Q) + (\u03b30 + \u03b3 * q\u0302)\u03c1\u2212 (Q) ,\n(3.5a)\nS (Q) =\n2\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\nk\u03bc k\u03bd\n\u2217 <\nT\nL |k|\nD\u03bc\u03bd (K) = fB (k0 ) \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd \u03c1T (K) + \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd 2 \u03c1L (K) + \u03be 4 .\n(3.5b)\nK\nK\nSome explanations are in order. First, q0 > 0 or k0 > 0 describes a fermion or a vector in\nthe final state, and q0 < 0 or k0 < 0 describes a fermion or a vector in the initial state: this\nconvention allows to compactly describe all possible processes. Indeed the factors\n\u001a\n1\nnB\nif k0 > 0\nfB (k0 ) \u2261 k0 /T\n=\n(3.6a)\n\u2212(1 + nB ) if k0 < 0\ne\n\u22121\n\u001a\n1\nnF\nif q0 > 0\nfF (q0 ) \u2261 q0 /T\n=\n(3.6b)\n1\n\u2212\nn\nif\nq0 < 0\ne\n\u22121\nF\n4\n\nThis might be not an entirely satisfactory approximation for the pole-pole contribution to gravitino production, as particle and sparticles happen to have similar dispersion relations at k \u223c T , and what matters for\nthe phase space is their mass difference. Due to this reason, we will find that the pole-pole contribution is small,\nand it seems unlikely that adding a finite width can change this conclusion.\nFurthermore, one might compensate this approximation by not subtracting modulus squared of s-channel\ndiagrams when computing subtracted rates. Since these details have negligible numerical significance, we\nprefect to avoid them.\n\n12\n\n\fgive the usual statistical factors: \u2212n (number of particles in the initial state) or 1\u00b1n (stimulated\nemission or Pauli-blocking in the final state), where nB,F (E) \u2261 1/(e|E|/T \u22131) are the usual BoseEinstein and Fermi-Dirac distributions.\nSecond, \u03c1+ , \u03c1\u2212 , \u03c1T , \u03c1L are the spectral densities for the fermion, fermion pole, transverse\nvectors and longitudinal vectors respectively. As discussed in the previous section, we can keep\nthe HTL pole approximation outside the light cone, so that\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03c1\u00b1 (Q) = 2\u03c0 Z\u00b1 (q) \u03b4(q0 \u2212 \u03c9\u00b1 (q)) + Z\u2213 \u03b4(q0 + \u03c9\u2213 (q)) + \u03c1cont\n(3.7a)\n\u00b1 (Q),\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03c1L,T (K) = 2\u03c0 ZL,T (k) \u03b4(k0 \u2212 \u03c9L,T (k)) \u2212 ZL,T \u03b4(k0 + \u03c9L,T (k)) + \u03c1cont\n(3.7b)\nL,T (Q).\nIn HTL approximation the residues at the poles are given in terms of the pole positions \u03c9\u00b1 (q)\nand \u03c9L,T (k) as [9, 8, 5]\nZ\u00b1 =\n\n2\n\u03c9\u00b1\n\u2212 q2\n,\n2m2F\n\nZL =\n\n\u03c9L (\u03c9L \u2212 k 2 )\n,\nk 2 (k 2 + 2m2V \u2212 \u03c9L2 )\n\nZT =\n\n\u03c9T (\u03c9T2 \u2212 k 2 )\n.\n2m2V \u03c9T2 \u2212 (\u03c9T2 \u2212 k 2 )2\n\n(3.8)\n\nThese formulae tell that residues for longitudinal and hole excitations are exponentially suppressed at energies larger than gT : they are low-energy collective phenomena. The continua\n\u03c1cont only exist below the light cone, at |q0 | < q and |k0 | < k. The spectral densities satisfy\nsum rules such as\nZ +\u221e\nZ +\u221e\nZ +\u221e\n2m2V\ndk0\ndk0\ndq0\n\u03c1\u00b1 (Q) = 1,\n\u03c1T (K) = 1,\n\u03c1L (K) =\n(3.9)\n3k 2\n\u2212\u221e 2\u03c0\n\u2212\u221e 2\u03c0\n\u2212\u221e 2\u03c0\nand the continuum turns out to contribute \u223c (10 \u00f7 20)% less than the poles. Eq. (3.9) means\nthat the number density of longitudinal vectors diverges at k \u2192 0, but this leaves finite gravitino\nrates thanks to the d3 k integration factor. In the T = 0 limit \u03c9\u00b1 (q) = \u00b1q, \u03c9L,T (k) = k and one\ncan check that the standard expressions for the propagators are recovered. Notice that \u03c1L,T\nhave dimensions mass\u22122 , while \u03c1\u00b1 have dimensions mass\u22121 .\n\n4\n\nGravitino production rate due to decay effects\n\nWe can now compute the imaginary part of diagram D in fig. 2, and extract from it the gravitino\nproduction rate. Using the gravitino \u2194 Goldstino equivalence, eq. (2.4), diagram D is obtained\nfrom eq. (2.2) by inserting the quadratic parts of the MSSM supercurrent (A.28) and of its\ndivergence (A.29):\n\u03bc\nS(2)\n\n(\u2202 * S)(2)\n\n3\nX\n\u0003\n1 (N ) \u03bd \u03c1 \u03bc 5 (N ) \u221a \u0002 \u03bd \u2217 \u03bd \u03bc i\nF\u03bd\u03c1 [\u03b3 , \u03b3 ]\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03bb \u2212 2 (\u2202 \u03c6i ) (\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03beL ) + (\u2202 \u03bd \u03c6i )(\u03b3 \u03bd \u03b3 \u03bc \u03beRi ) ,\n=\u2212\n4\nN =1\n\n3\nX\nMN\n=\u2212\nON ,\n4\nN =1\n\n(N )\nON = F\u03bc\u03bd\n[\u03b3\u03bc , \u03b3\u03bd ]i\u03b3 5 \u03bb(N )\n(N )\n\nwhere N runs over the three factors of the MSSM gauge group, and F\u03bd\u03c1 here stands for the\nlinearized part of the corresponding field strength. We ignored soft-breaking squared masses of\n\n13\n\n\fscalars, as they have higher dimension than gaugino masses MN .

(4.2) is obtained. The Goldstino part, proportional to MN2 /3m23/2 ,\nis straightforward. We emphasize that the divergence of the supercurrent is evaluated before\nevaluating its thermal matrix element. Indeed, while thermal masses na\u0131\u0308vely look like SUSYbreaking terms of order g 2 T , they actually do not contribute to \u2202\u03bc S \u03bc , and a mistake about this\nissue would make the Goldstino rate qualitatively wrong [11, 12, 13] (see also appendix A).\nIndeed, despite the nice formalism employed to compute them (periodic and anti-periodic\nboundary conditions in imaginary time for bosons and fermions respectively), thermal effects\njust are one particular background: no background affects the operator equations of motion,\nsuch that a supercurrent which is conserved at T = 0 remains conserved at finite T .5\nFor the remaining massless gravitino part, we insert the explicit value of the gravitino\npolarization tensor (2.5) and get two terms of the form\n1\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n/ (2) P\n/S\n/ (2) iT\nTrhS\u0304(2)\nP\n/ S(2)\niT + TrhS\n2\n\n(4.3)\n\n\u03bc\nwhere S\n/ (2) \u2261 \u03b3\u03bc S(2)\n. We can now perform simplifications that only employ the known Dirac\u03bc\nmatrix structure of S(2)\n:\n\n\u2022 The vector/gaugino contributions obey S\n/ (2) = 0 (thanks to \u03b3\u03bc [\u03b3\u03b1 , \u03b3\u03b2 ]\u03b3 \u03bc = 0), such that\nonly the first term of eq. (4.3) contributes. It is reduced to the same operator ON using\nthe \u03b3\u03bc \u03b3\u03b1 \u03b3 \u03bc = \u22122\u03b3\u03b1 identity and taking into account that the thermally corrected gluino\npropagator has the same \u03b3-matrix structure as the massless propagator. This leads to\nthe 1 + MN2 /3m23/2 prefactor in eq. (4.2).\n\u2022 The quark/squark contributions vanish, thanks to a cancellation between the two terms\nin eq. (4.3). Indeed, by applying the \u03b3\u03bc \u03b3\u03b1 \u03b3 \u03bc = \u22122\u03b3\u03b1 identity (one time in the first\nterm, and two times in the second term) both terms reduce to the matrix element\nTrh\u03be \u0304R (\u2202/ \u03c6)P\n/ (\u2202/ \u03c6\u2217 )\u03beLi, with opposite coefficients.\nWe don't know if there is some deeper reason dictating these cancellations such that the\nfull result is controlled by the thermal matrix element of the operator ON times the prefactor\n1 + MN2 /3m23/2 . A general proof of this result would allow to get the full production rate from\nthe simple Goltstino rate according to eq. (4.2).\nFor completeness we mention that we have studied thermal corrections to the ON operators\nin HTL approximation. As well known gauge vertices g receive very large thermal corrections\n5\n\nAlthough this is not relevant for us, we can be more precise: thermal effects spontaneously break supersymmetry in the visible sector, and the associated thermal Goldstino mode was identified with a particular\ncollective excitation [14]. The conservation of the supercurrent at finite temperature is therefore analogous to\nhow electroweak gauge currents remain conserved despite the Higgs vev. However, since the thermal Goldstino\nis a low energy phenomenon, we don't know how to extend it to write an explicit conserved supercurrent that\nalso holds at energies E \u223c T .\n\n14\n\n\fof order g(1 + g 2T 2 /k 2 ) where k \u226a T (HTL approximation) is some external momentum: their\npresence would be problematic, as they seem to describe infra-red divergent effects (see e.g.\nsection 10.3 of [5]). In the case of gauge vertices these corrections are demanded by gauge invariance: different diagrams combine such that LHTL of eq. (3.1) contains the gauge-covariant\nderivative D. On the contrary Yukawa couplings do not receive these problematic HTL corrections. We verified that the Goldstino vertex \u03c7ON does not receive any HTL correction.6\nBeyond the HTL limit there will be corrections suppressed by powers of g/\u03c0, that we can ignore.\n\n4.1\n\nGravitino propagator\n\nWe now restart from eq.

The\nintegration range is restricted by momentum conservation, p + k + q = 0, i.e. |k \u2212 q| \u2264 p =\nk0 + q0 \u2264 k + q: any side of a triangle cannot be longer than the sum of the other two or shorter\nthan their difference.\nThe last two equations generalize eq. (38) of [2], who considered the vector/gaugino loop\nin the limit of hard gravitino and soft vector (small k0 \u226a p, T , such that fB (k0 ) \u2243 T /k0 ) and\nneglected the gaugino thermal mass (i.e. \u03c1\u2212 \u2243 0 and \u03c1+ \u2243 2\u03c0\u03b4(q0 \u2212q) such that q = q0 = p\u2212k0 ).\n\n4.2\n\nDecay contribution to the gravitino production rate\n\nIn conclusion, the decay contribution to the gravitino production rate per space-time volume is\ngiven by eq. (4.6). The coefficients fN have to be evaluated numerically. We approximate the\nspectral densities outside the light cone as \u03b4-function poles (using full expressions they would be\nnarrow bells, making numerical integration difficult for our limited computing power), such that\nwe have four types of contributions: pole-pole, continuum-continuum, (vector pole)-(gaugino\ncontinuum) and (vector continuum)-(gaugino pole). A vector can be either longitudinal or\ntransverse, in the initial state or in the final state, and similarly for the gaugino.\nThe resulting coefficients fN depend on the gauge couplings and on the content of matter\ncharged under the given gauge group; in the MSSM it is convenient to parametrize them as\nfunctions of the thermal vector masses mVN listed in eq. (3.3):\nfN \u2261 fN (\n\nmVN\n).\nT\n\n(4.8)\n\nFor example m3 \u2248 1.3T for the gluon at T \u2248 109 GeV. The functions fN are plotted in fig. 1.\nIn HTL approximation there would be a unique N-independent function f , and the functions\nfN turn out to be somewhat different, depending on the relative amount of vector and chiral\nmultiplets present within each group. In non-minimal models with more chiral multiplets than\nin the MSSM, one would have to add their extra contributions to vector thermal masses, and\nto slightly revise the functions fN .\nFinally, let us try to discuss the accuracy of our result. Thermal corrections to the pressure\nhave been computed up to high orders in g3 [15]: these computations can be used to see how\nconvergent the perturbative expansion is in practice. In the favorable limit Nf \u226b Nc (where\nNf is the number of flavors and Nc is the number of colors) the perturbative expansion for the\npressure remains accurate up to mV /T \u2248 1 (fig. 1 of [15]). This presumably also applies to our\ncase, as SUSY-QCD has a set of fermions and scalars that give the same contribution to the\ngluon thermal mass as Nf = 21 flavors in the fundamental.\n16\n\n\fQ\nH\nU\n\n\u03c8\n\nQ\n\n\u03c8\n\nQ\n\n~\nQ\n~\nH\n\n~\nU\n\n~\nH\n\nU\n\nU\n\nFigure 8: Top scatterings.

This could be done analogously to how [16] used AdS/CFT to compute the photon\nemission rate from strongly coupled N = 4 SYM in the large Nc limit. By analogy, we expect\nthat at strong coupling the gravitino rate functions fN will have a finite limit, Nc -independent\nup to 1/Nc corrections.\n\n5\n\nProduction of gravitinos due to the top Yukawa\n\nPrevious works considered gravitino production due to the g3 , g2 and gY gauge couplings;\nthe top quark Yukawa, \u03bbt QUH, also has a sizable coupling \u03bbt . There are two main kind of\nscattering processes:\na) Scatterings involving fermions only, such as QU \u2192 \u03a8H\u0303: fig. 8 shows the relevant Feynman diagrams. They would populate only the spin 3/2 component of the gravitino, as\nonly dimension-2 soft terms enter these diagrams, so that Goldstinos are not produced.\n2\nHowever, an explicit computation shows that the dominant contribution, of order T 6 /MPl\n,\nvanishes.\nb) Scatterings involving two fermions and two scalars, such as Q\u0303\u0168 \u2192 \u03a8H\u0303: fig. 9 shows the\nrelevant Feynman diagrams. The first diagram involves At , the dimension-1 A-term of\nthe top Yukawa coupling, and populates the spin 1/2 component of the gravitino. The\nother three diagrams populate the spin 3/2 component.\n\n17\n\n\f( n / s) / (\u0393 / HR s)TRH\n\n1\nNaive reheating\n\n0.8\n\nReheating\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n10-2\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n102\n\n103\n\nT RH / T\n\nFigure 10: Evolution of the gravitino abundancy n/s in units of \u03b3/HR s at T = TRH for na\u0131\u0308ve\ninstant reheating and for the conventional model of reheating.\nThe total result is:\nX\nall\n\n|A (top scatterings)|2 = 72\n\nA2t\n\u03bb2t\n)s\n(1\n+\n2\n3m23/2\nM\u0304Pl\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere s = (P1 + P2 )2 is the usual kinematical variable.

(5.2) is the scattering contribution. We now explain why it also is our total result. First, it happens to be infra-red convergent: the potentially\ndivergent contributions given by the modulus squared of the t-channel and u-channel diagrams\nin fig. 9 actually vanish. Therefore, unlike in the case of gauge scatterings, the inclusion of\nthermal masses is not necessary for obtaining a finite result. Furthermore, including thermal\neffects along the lines of the previous sections does not affect the final result. Indeed the top\nYukawa coupling gives a thermal mass for top, stops (and higgs and higgsinos): the resulting\nquark/squark/gravitino (and higgs/higgsino/gravitino) decay rates have been computed in section 4 for generic thermal masses, and vanish. Consistency requires that the subtracted top\nscattering rate equals the total scattering rate of eq. (5.2), and indeed the subtracted terms are\nthe modulus squared of the t-channel and u-channel diagrams in fig. 9, which vanish.\nAgain, all these cancellations have a simple interpretation: they are the ones needed such\nthat the production rate for the spin 3/2 components of the gravitino equals the production\nrate for the spin 1/2 Goldstino components, up to the prefactor in eq. (5.1). Indeed, using the\ngravitino/Goldstino equivalence, the Goldstino production rate can be equivalently computed\nfrom one single diagram that only involves the single quartic Goldstino coupling,\nAt \u03bbt Goldstino (higgsino squark squark\u2217 + quark squark\u2217 higgs + h.c.),\nsuch that decay contributions and subtracted scattering rates simply do not exist for the Goldstino.\n\n18\n\n\f6\n\nBoltzmann equations with reheating\n\nWe here compute the gravitino abundance by integrating the relevant Boltzmann equations.\nWhile previous works ignored the history of the universe prior to its reheating (from the point\nof view of computing gravitino production this in practice amounts to assuming that the Big\nBang started at the maximal temperature TRH ), we here follow the standard definition of the\nreheating temperature TRH , where MSSM particles are progressively reheated by the energy\nreleased by some non-relativistic energy density \u03c1\u03c6 , which could describe e.g. an oscillating\ninflaton field, or some non-relativistic particle decaying into MSSM particles.8 In both cases\nthe relevant Boltzmann equations are\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u03c1\u0307\u03c6 + 3H\u03c1\u03c6 = \u2212\u0393\u03c6 \u03c1\u03c6\n\u03c1\u0307R + 4H\u03c1R = \u0393\u03c6 \u03c1\u03c6\n(6.1)\n\uf8f3\n\u1e453/2 + 3Hn3/2 = \u03b3\n\nwhere n3/2 is the\na dot denotes d/dt,\np gravitino number density summed over its polarizations,\n2\nH = \u1e58/R = 8\u03c0(\u03c1\u03c6 + \u03c1R )/3/MPl is the expansion factor, \u03c1R = \u03c0 g\u2217 T 4 /30 is the energy\ndensity of MSSM radiation at temperature T (with g\u2217 = 228.75, up to O(g 2 ) corrections,\nand up to adding right-handed neutrinos), and \u0393\u03c6 parameterizes the decay width of \u03c1\u03c6 .

There is a debate in the literature whether such condensates can be sufficiently\nlong-lived to affect reheating [17]. For simplicity, we here do not consider these possible but model-depenent\nphenomena.\n\n19\n\n\fIn previous analyses \u03c1\u03c6 was ignored and the 'instantaneous reheating' approximation was\nused, which amounts to start the Big Bang from a maximal temperature T = TRH : this gives\na slightly larger gravitino abundance\nY (T \u226a TRH ) =\n\n\u03b3\nHR s\n\n.\n\n(6.6)\n\nT =TRH\n\nFig. 10 illustrates the different evolution of Y (in arbitrary units) between the two cases.\nWithin the standard \u039bCDM cosmological model, present data demand a DM energy density\n\u03a9DM h2 = 0.110\u00b10.006; if DM are non relativistic particles with mass M \u226b keV this corresponds\nto YDM = (0.40 \u00b1 0.02) eV/M [20].

This plot ignores all model dependent issues,\nincluding who is the LSP and the NLSP. Let us briefly summarize these issues [1, 21, 22, 23].\n\n\u2022 If the gravitino is the stable LSP then\n\u2013 if m3/2 \u226b keV the gravitino behaves as cold dark matter and its energy density can\nbe at most equal to the DM density.\n\u2013 a somewhat stronger constraint applies if the gravitino is lighter, T0 \u226a m3/2 <\n\u223c keV,\nand consequently behaves as warm dark matter or radiation. The Goldstino component of such a light gravitino thermalizes (unless TRH is as low as possible), so that\nthis scenario is severely constrained: assuming that the Goldstino was in thermal\nequilibrium when g\u2217 \u223c 100, present data demand m3/2 <\n\u223c 16 eV [22].\n\nAn additional contribution to the gravitino energy density, \u03a9extra\n3/2 \u2243 \u03a9NLSP m3/2 /mNLSP\n(having neglected entropy production, which typically is an excellent approximation) is\ngenerated by NLSP decays, with mass mNLSP and mass density \u03a9NLSP after their freezeout. Weak scale sparticles give \u03a9NLSP \u223c 1, such that this extra contribution is significant\nif m3/2 is not much smaller than mNLSP .\n\n\u2022 If heavier than the LSP (which possibly has mass mLSP \u223c 100 GeV), the gravitino gravitationally decays into the LSP and some SM particles:\n\u2013 If m3/2 \u226b 10 TeV the gravitino decays before BBN, generating a contribution to\nthe LSP energy density, \u03a9LSP \u2243 mLSP \u03a93/2 /m3/2 [1] (we neglected the entropy in\ngravitinos).\n\u2013 A lighter gravitino decays during or after BBN, damaging nucleosynthesis. The\nresulting bound on \u03a93/2 depends on which SM particles are produced by gravitino\ndecays, and typically is some orders of magnitude stronger than the DM bound\n\u03a93/2 h2 <\n\u223c 0.1 [21]. Very late gravitino decay into photons would also distort the\nCMB energy spectrum.\n20\n\n\f15\n0G\n\neV\n\nFigure 11: The bands show the region\nwhere the thermal gravitino abundance\nequals the DM abundance (3\u03c3 regions), assuming unified gaugino masses with m1/2 =\n150 GeV (roughly the minimal value allowed by present data) or m1/2 = 1 TeV\nat the unification scale, and negligible At .\nModel-dependent issues are here ignored,\nincluding who is the LSP and the NLSP.\nSuccessful thermal leptogenesis with zero\ninitial right-handed neutrino abundance is\nnot possible within the gray band [24, 19].\n\n1/\n\n2\n\n=\n\n109\n\n1T\n\neV\n\nm\n\n1/\n\n2\n\n=\n\n108\n\nm\n\nReheating temperature in GeV\n\n1010\n\nProblematic within\nthermal leptogenesis\n107\n\n1\n\n10\n102\nGravitino mass in GeV\n\n103\n\nWe recall that we computed thermal production of gravitinos from MSSM particles at temperatures TRH \u226b m3/2 , msoft . The true physics might be different. For example, the messenger fields\nwith mass MGM employed by gauge mediation models might be so light that they get thermalized (together with the hidden sector) and later decay back to MSSM particles, leaving a thermalized Goldstino. Eq. (6.3) shows that this phenomenon is dominant if MGM <\n\u223c (10 \u00f7 100)TRH ,\n5\nas the gravitino abundance gets washed-out as Y \u221d T during reheating at T >\n\u223c TRH .\n\n7\n\nConclusions\n\nPrevious computations of the thermal gravitino production rate [2, 3] were performed at leading order in small gauge couplings, finding a rate of the form \u03b3 \u221d g 2 ln 1/g, which behaves\nunphysically when extrapolated to the true MSSM values of the gauge couplings, g \u223c 1 (see\nfig. 1). We improved on these results in the following ways:\n1. We included gravitino production via gluon \u2192 gluino + gravitino and other decays: these\neffects first arise at higher order in g (the phase space is opened by thermal masses), but\nare enhanced with respect to scattering processes by a phase-space \u03c0 2 factor, typical of\n3-body vs 4-body rates. The gravitino production rate becomes about twice larger, or\nmore if M3 >\n\u223c M1,2 \u226b m3/2 .\n2. We added production processes induced by the top quark Yukawa coupling. This enhances\nthe gravitino production rate by almost 10% or more if At is bigger than gaugino masses.\n\n3. Finally, we computed the gravitino abundance replacing the instant reheating approximation with the standard definition of the reheating process, where TRH is not the maximal\ntemperature but defines the temperature at which inflaton decay ends, ceasing to release entropy. This improvement decreases the gravitino abundance by 25% and allows a\nprecise comparison with leptogenesis [24], where reheating was included in [19].\nOur result for the gravitino production rate is\n\u03b3 = \u03b3D + \u03b3Ssub + \u03b3top .\n21\n\n(7.1)\n\n\fGravitino production rate\n\n0.5\ntotal\n0.4\nSU(3)\n0.3\ntotal [Pradler, Steffen]\n\n0.2\n\nSU(3) [Bolz et al.]\n\n0.1\n\nSU(2)\nU(1)\n\n0\n4\n\n10\n\n10\n\n6\n\ntop\n8\n\n10\n\n10\n10\nTemperature in GeV\n\n1012\n\n1014\n\n2\nFigure 12: Production rate \u03b3 = dN/dV dt in units of T 6 /M\u0304Pl\nfor the spin-3/2 gravitino components in the MSSM.

In this plot we assumed \u03bbt = 0.7 and a unified \u03b1 = 1/24,\nrenormalized at the scale MGUT = 2 * 1016 GeV.\nAccessory results scattered through the paper include: a clean precise re-derivation of gravitino couplings; expressions for thermal masses in a generic supersymmetric theory; the observation that they respect supersymmetry at energy much larger than the temperature; a collection\nof formulae for thermal corrections to vectors (including correct imaginary parts) beyond the\nHard Thermal Loop (HTL) approximation; a possibly non-standard discussion of the physical\nmeaning of negative spectral densities; a technique that allows to deal with Coulomb-like infrared divergences without introducing an arbitrary splitting scale k\u2217 that satisfies the problematic\ncondition gT \u226a k\u2217 \u226a T .\n\nA curious result simplified our computation: the differential production rates for the spin\n3/2 and for the spin 1/2 (Goldstino) gravitino component are equal up to a universal prefactor,\ndespite that Goldstino couplings (to dimension-1 SUSY-breaking soft terms in the supercurrent)\napparently are much simpler than the spin-3/2 couplings (gravitational, to the supersymmetric\nsupercurrent). This equality holds thanks to various cancellations, such that various troubling\ncontributions automatically drop out from our computation.\nAcknowledgements We thank R. Barbieri, C. Scrucca, G. Giudice, A. Notari, G. Moore. A.S.\n\nthanks R. Rattazzi who suggested that we look into the higher-order corrections to the gravitino\nproduction rate because this problem involves conceptual issues of academic interest. On the contrary\nthe 100% enhancement with respect to previous results is relevant for phenomenology, and we could\n\n22\n\n\fcompute it without understanding why we don't need to understand how to write the supercurrent at\nfinite temperature.\n\nA\n\nGravitino propagator and couplings\n\nWe here derive the needed gravitino propagator and couplings, both generic and specialized for the\nMSSM. The results contained in this section are not new, but they are useful for two reasons. First,\nbecause all factors (i, \u03b35 , PL , etc) and subtleties should be right, and are relevant for satisfying the consistency checks that we performed in our subsequent computations. Second, because we recomputed\nrelevant gravitino properties in a way that we consider simpler than in previous literature: we proceed\ndirectly, without using Noether and supergravity techniques, which are unnecessarily cumbersome\nfor our purposes. We use the standard Weyl spinor and \u03b3-matrix conventions corresponding to the\nsignature (+ \u2212 \u2212\u2212), see e.g. [25]. The phase of the gauginos is chosen such that gaugino couplings to\nmatter are real. We assume a Minkowski background i.e. we neglect the small cosmological constant.\n\nA.1\n\nThe gravitino Lagrangian\n\nThe gravitino is the gauge field associated with local supersymmetry, and becomes massive by means of\na super-Higgs mechanism: 'eating' the massless Goldstino fermion arising when global supersymmetry\nis spontaneously broken. This is analogous to a gauge vector that becomes massive via the usual Higgs\nmechanism, so that we start recalling some general properties of this well known simpler case, and\nthis analogy will later allow us to derive gravitino properties following the same logic.\n\nParadigmatic digression\nWe thus consider a U(1) gauge symmetry broken by the vev of a charged scalar field H. In the limit of\nvanishing gauge coupling, a massless Goldstone \u03c7 appears in the expansion of H around the minimum,\nH = v + i\u03c7, and \u03c7 transforms (under a U(1) rotation with infinitesimal angle \u03b5) as \u03b4\u03c7 = v\u03b5. The total\nU(1) current is given by\nJ\u03bc = J\u03bcmat \u2212 v \u2202\u03bc \u03c7,\n(A.1)\n\nwhere J\u03bcmat is the U(1) current of the rest of the theory (e.g. fermionic matter). The total U(1) current\nis conserved:\n\u2202\u03bc J\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc J\u03bcmat \u2212 v \u2202 2 \u03c7 = 0.\n(A.2)\n\nThis is the case if and only if the Lagrangian contains the coupling\n1\nv\n\nL \u2283 \u03c7 * \u2202\u03bc J\u03bcmat .\n\n(A.3)\n\nThis is sometimes known as Goldberger-Treiman relation, and shows that Goldstone interactions are\npredicted in terms of nonconservation of the matter symmetry current induced in the process of\nsymmetry breaking.\nWhen the U(1) symmetry is gauged, the total gauge-invariant Lagrangian is\n1\n1\n1 2\n+ (\u2202\u03bc \u03c7 \u2212 vA\u03bc )2 + (A\u03bc \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u03c7)J\u03bcmat + Lmat .\nL = \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd\n4\n2\nv\n\n(A.4)\n\nWe can fix the unitary gauge by setting \u03c7 to zero or, equivalently, by redefining A\u2032\u03bc = A\u03bc \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u03c7/v.\nThe second term in (A.4) becomes a mass term for A\u2032\u03bc . Notice that while A\u03bc couples to the total\nconserved current J\u03bc given by eq. (A.1), the massive vector A\u2032\u03bc couples to J\u03bcmat .\n\n23\n\n\fThe last thing that we want to recall concerns production of massive gauge bosons at high energy\nE \u226b v. The effective Lagrangian appropriate for this situation is obtained from (A.4) by keeping\nterms with the highest number of derivatives in A\u03bc and \u03c7, and is given by\n1\n1\n1 2\n+ (\u2202\u03bc \u03c7)2 + A\u03bc J\u03bcmat + \u03c7 * \u2202\u03bc J\u03bcmat + Lmat .\nLHE = \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd\n4\n2\nv\n\n(A.5)\n\nWe thus see that the total cross section can be approximated (up to terms suppressed by v/E) by the\nsum of massless gauge boson production plus production of Goldstones with coupling (A.3):\n\u03c3(A\u2032\u03bc ) = \u03c3(A\u03bc ) + \u03c3(\u03c7).\n\n(A.6)\n\nThis statement is called the equivalence theorem. It can also be deduced (in a less transparent\nway) from the fact that the physical state projector for the gauge boson of mass m takes the form\n\u2212g\u03bc\u03bd + k\u03bc k\u03bc /m2 . Notice that, while to get the correct Goldstone production rate it is crucial to\ntake current nonconservation into account, in computing \u03c3(A\u03bc ) we can actually assume that J\u03bcmat is\nconserved.\nThe main points of the above discussion - the form of the total current, the Goldberger-Treiman\nrelation, the fact that the massive gauge boson couples to the same matter current, and the equivalence\ntheorem - will find their analogues in the gravitino case.\n\nGoldstino interaction\nWe now repeat the steps in the previous\nsection in the case of supersymmetry, under which the\n\u221a\nGoldstino \u03c7 transforms as \u03b4\u03c7 = 2F \u03b5, where F is a supersymmetry-breaking vev9 and \u03b5 is the\nsupersymmetric parameter. The supercurrent is\n\u221a\n\u03bc\n(A.7)\n+ i 2F \u03b3 \u03bc \u03c7\nS \u03bc = Svis\nwhere the apex 'vis' signals that we are interested in theories consisting of a visible and a hidden\nsector.

In the massive gauge boson case, the equivalence theorem\ncould also be derived from the form of the physical state projector of the massive gauge boson. Below\nwe will see that an analogous derivation can also be given for the massive gravitino case. Just as in\n\u03bc\nthe gauge boson case, we can assume that the supercurrent in the coupling S\u0304vis\n\u03c8\u03bc is conserved; in the\nGoldstino coupling the current nonconservation is of course crucial and has to be taken into account.\nA further simplification concerns the Goldstino coupling (A.15): as we explain below this coupling\nis irrelevant in MSSM at energies much above the \u03bc-term due to approximate scale-invariance.

Since the divergence of the supercurrent will be proportional to the soft-breaking\nmasses (see below), the effective coupling in the second term is msoft /F \u223c 1/Mmess . Thus the two\nterms are equally important if SUSY breaking is mediated by gravity, Mmess \u223c M\u0304Pl . If instead\nMmess \u226a M\u0304Pl , like in gauge-mediation models, the Goldstino term dominates [1].\n\nA.2\n\nThe gravitino propagator and polarization tensor\n\nMassless gravitino\nSince the Lagrangian is invariant under local supersymmetry, the same physics can be described by\ndifferent choices of gravitino propagators and polarization tensors.

Gauge-invariant observables do not depend on\nthe choice of U .\nAs usual, local gauge invariance allows to define more convenient gauge choices. For example,\none can impose the gauge-fixing condition F \u2261 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03a8\u03bc = 0 (in this gauge one also has \u2202\u03bc \u03a8\u03bc = 0 as a\nconsequence of the equations of motion). To derive the propagator, it is best to consider an analogue\nof the \u03be-gauge by adding to the Lagrangian the gauge-fixing term F\u0304 i\u2202/ F/\u03be.

One can check that (A.25) is consistent with (A.24).\n2\n2\nIn this paper we are interested in production of ultrarelativistic gravitinos.

In our case this 'discontinuity'\nis entirely expected and is consistent with the equivalence theorem as expressed by eq. (A.18): the\nextra spin 1/2 fermion is nothing but the Goldstino.\nWhen we take soft SUSY-breaking into account, the supercurrent is no longer conserved. The first\nterm in (A.26) can then be interpreted as corresponding to the Goldstino production due to the last\nterm in (A.18) (the coefficient agrees as one checks using (A.14)). In this derivation of the equivalence\ntheorem it is non-obvious that the terms in (A.25) proportional to m\u22121\n3/2 should cancel, as is required\nfor full agreement with (A.18). However this cancellation does happen, as verified in the explicit\ncomputations needed for this paper.\n\nA.3\n\nMSSM supercurrent at zero temperature\n\nGravitino couplings\nIn a generic renormalizable SUSY gauge theory with vector supermultiplets (Aa\u03bc , \u03bba ) and matter chiral\nsupermultiplets \u03a6i = (\u03c6i , \u03bei ) and superpotential W the Weyl part s\u03bc of the Majorana supercurrent\nS \u03bc = (s\u03bc ,s\u0304\u03bc ) is (see e.g. [31] or explicitly compute it)\n\u221a \u0002\n\u0003 1 a \u03bd \u03c1 \u03bc a\n(\u03c3 \u03c3\u0304 \u03c3 \u03bb\u0304 ) \u2212 ig(\u03c6\u2217i Tija \u03c6j )(\u03c3 \u03bc \u03bb\u0304a )\ns\u03bc = \u2212 2 (D\u03bd \u03c6i )\u2217 (\u03c3\u03bd \u03c3\u0304 \u03bc \u03bei ) + iWi\u2217 (\u03c6\u2217 )\u03c3 \u03bc \u03be\u0304i \u2212 F\u03bd\u03c1\n2\n\n(A.27)\n\n\u03bc\nwhere Dij\n= \u03b4ij \u2202\u03bc +igA\u03bca Tija is the gauge-covariant derivative.

Indeed the supercurrent divergence is\nno longer zero, however it is BRST exact (see e.g. [33]). Thus the amplitude for longitudinal gravitino\nemission still vanishes, and the gravitino gauge invariance is preserved.\nThe terms proportional to \u03b3 \u03bc are sometimes omitted from the supercurrent expression (A.28),\nbecause they do not contribute to the massive gravitino production due to the on-shell condition\n\u03b3 \u03bc \u03a8\u03bc = 0.

At quantum level the scale invariance and the R-symmetry are\n\u03bc-term, and this explains S\n\u03bc\nanomalous, e.g. \u2202\u03bc R is given by the triangle anomaly equation:\n\u2202\u03bc R\u03bc =\n\nX bN g2\n\nN\n\n48\u03c0 2\n\n(N ) (N )\nF\u03bc\u03bd\nF\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\n\nwhere the anomaly coefficients bN = {11, 1, \u22123} are the same as the one-loop \u03b2-function coefficients\nof the MSSM gauge groups, which is again related to the fact that \u2202\u03bc R\u03bc and T \u03bc\u03bc are in the same\n/ to \u2202\u03bc R\u03bc , one can show that (see [35])\nsupermultiplet.

(2.2). Supersymmetry is broken by finite temperature,\nbut this breaking is spontaneous, so the supercurrent remains conserved: \u2202\u03bc S\u03bc = 0 holds as an\noperator equation. This means that the production rate of longitudinal gravitinos vanishes also at\nfinite temperature. Equivalently, \u03a0< (P ) is invariant under gauge transformations of the gravitino\n3/2\npolarization tensor, \u03b4\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd = P\u03bc A\u03bd + P\u03bd B\u03bc , with arbitrary A, B. The statements of the previous\nparagraph should hold identically in any computation including all diagrams to a given order in the\nthermal bath coupling g. In practice, however, it may be difficult to see the vanishing of \u03b4\u03a0< explicitly.\nE.g. as explained in section 2 we are resumming a well-defined class of physical effects to order g4 :\nthose enhanced by a 1 \u2192 2 phase space factor, unlike a generic O(g4 ) correction. More precisely,\ndiagram D is computed including thermal corrections to the propagators of particles to which the\n\n29\n\n\fgravitino couples, while diagrams S1,2,3 are computed using tree-level propagators. In particular, we\ndo not include corrections to the gravitino vertex. For this reason we expect a residual gravitino gauge\ndependence, which we believe to be of relative order g2 /\u03c0 2 with respect to our result. The reason is\nthat in our calculation of the massless gravitino production rate, thermal masses act similar to soft\nSUSY-breaking terms, modifying equations of motion by terms of order g2 T , so that \u2202 *S \u223c g2 T rather\nthan being zero. This means that \u03b4\u03a0< \u223c O(g4 ). We see that this non-gauge invariance is of the right\norder of magnitude to be cancelled by vertex corrections. The above residual non-gauge invariance\ncan be tolerated when computing the massless gravitino production rate.\nWhen computing the Goldstino production rate, we have taken into account that, in absence of\nsoft-SUSY breaking, the Goldstino coupling to \u2202 * S vanishes at finite temperature by evaluating the\ndivergence of the supercurrent before computing the thermal matrix element, i.e. we start the finitetemperature computation from eq. (A.29). Since we do not evaluate vertex corrections, this procedure\nis expected to give a result with the same O(g2 /\u03c0 2 ) error as the gravitino production rate.\nFinally, the anomaly relation (A.33) valid at zero temperature also holds at finite temperature. The\nargument is the same as in case of the supercurrent conservation: the thermal bath is a background,\nand (A.33) is a dynamical property of the Hamiltonian valid for any background. In practice this\n/ can be neglected.\nmeans that the Goldstino coupling to S\n\nB\n\nVector propagator at finite temperature\n\nWe list the full one-loop expressions for thermal corrections to a vector with four-momentum K =\n(\u03c9, ~k) (K 2 = \u03c9 2 \u2212 k2 ) with respect to the rest frame of the thermal plasma.
