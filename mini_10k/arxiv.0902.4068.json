KGaA, Weinheim\n\n1 Introduction\nThe elliptical galaxy NGC 1052 with a LINER is the nearest object among radio-loud and broad megamaser sources\n(e.g. Gabel et al. 2000). The redshift of z = 0.0049 (Knapp\net al. 1978) corresponds to a distance of 20.3 Mpc and the\nangular scale is 98 pc arcsec\u22121 if we adopt the Hubble constant H0 = 72 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and q0 = 0.5. (Spergel et al.\n2003). This galaxy hosts a well defined double-sided radio\njet of a few pc with P.A. \u223c 65\u25e6 . The jet emanates from the\nnucleus and can be traced out to kilo-pc-scales (Cohen et\nal. 1971; Wrobel 1984; Jones 1984, Kellermann et al. 1998;\nKameno et al. 2001; Vermeulen et al. 2003; Kadler et al.\n2004b). The lower limit to the jet inclination of 57\u25e6 is estimated by Vermeulen et al. 2003. Radio observations of the\nlow-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN) of NGC 1052\nwith VLBI at multiple frequencies have revealed the presence of a dense circumnuclear structure, which obscures the\nvery center of this elliptical galaxy (Kellermann et al. 1998;\nKameno et al. 2001; Vermeulen et al. 2003; Kadler et al.\n2004b).\nThis object shows a convex radio spectrum peaked at\n10 GHz, to be classified as a GHz-Peaked Spectrum (GPS)\nsource (de Vries et al. 1997; O'Dea 1998). The convex\nspectum is explained as free-free absorption (FFA) due to\na dense plasma obscuring the nuclear torus (Kameno et al.\n2001, 2003; Kadler et al. 2004b; Vermeulen et al. 2003). Xray spectra also imply a high column density of 1022 cm\u22122\nto 1023 cm\u22122 toward the center, and support the presence of\n\u22c6 Corresponding author: e-mail: sss@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp\n\na dense gas torus (Guainazzi & Antonelli 1999; Weaver et\nal. 1999; Kadler et al. 2004a).\nThe center of NGC 1052 harbors a luminous H2 O megamaser, which is redshifted by 50\u2013350 km s\u22121 with respect to\nthe systemic velocity of the galaxy (1491 km s\u22121 ; de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991). The spectral profile typically shows\na broad velocity width of \u223c100 km s\u22121 (FWHM) (Braatz,\nWilson & Henkel, 1994, 1996, Braatz et al. 2003). Past\nVLBI images reveal that H2 O maser gas with the velocity\nrange of 1585\u20131685 km s\u22121 is distributed along the continuum ridge of the western jet, 0.05\u20130.1 pc shifted to the\nwest from the gap between the eastern and western jets in\nNovember 1995. Excitation by shocks into the dense molecular clump which lies in or around the radio jet, or amplification of the radio continuum emission of the jet by foreground molecular clouds, were suggested by Claussen et al.\n(1998). On the other hand, Kameno et al. (2005) presented\nthe circumnuclear torus model to explain the time variability of the H2 O maser emission. Relevant to the interpretation of the H2 O maser emission line, several absorption\nlines are also found toward the center of NGC 1052 (H I:\nvan Gorkom et al. 1986; OH : Omar et al. 2002; HCO+ ,\nHCN and CO : Liszt and Lucas 2004).\n\n2 Observations and Results\nIn order to confirm the positional relation between the H2 O\nmaser gas and the proposed circumnuclear torus, we observed the continuum and maser emissions in the nucleus\nof NGC 1052 with the VLBA. The continuum emissions\nwere measured at 15 and 43 GHz. At 22 GHz, the H2 O\n\nc 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n\n\f250\n\nS. Sawada-Satoh et al.: A Dense Plasma in NGC 1052\n\nFig. 2 Free-free absorption opacity along the jet axis (P.A.\n= 65\u25e6 ) which is shown as a solid line in Fig. 3. The fit in the\ninner edge has larger errors, because the continuum spectrum of the inner edge does not show the peak between 15\nand 43 GHz.\n\n3 Discussions\nFig. 1 The aligned images of NGC 1052 at 15, 22 and 43\nGHz with the VLBA. The synthesized beam sizes (FWHM)\nare 1.3\u00d70.49 mas in P.A.= \u22124.8\u25e6 , 0.86\u00d70.32 mas in P.A.=\n\u22127.1\u25e6 , 0.39\u00d70.17 mas in P.A.= \u22122.8\u25e6 , respectively, as\nshown in the left of each image. The contours start at 3\u03c3\nlevel, increasing by a factor of 2, where \u03c3 = 0.24, 1.07 and\n1.45 mJy beam\u22121 , respectively at 15, 22 and 43 GHz.\n\nmaser emission and the line-free continuum emission were\nobserved simultaneously. Channel maps of H2 O maser\nemission were made every 6.74 km s\u22121 , averaging every\n10 spectral channels.\nThe continuum images at 15, 22 and 43 GHz show the\ntwo-sided jet structure which consists of several components (Fig. 1). The extended structures of knots A, C1 and D\nbecome fainter at higher frequency bands. Knots B, C2 and\nC3 are resolved into several components at 22 and 43 GHz.\nThe central engine is supposed to lie between the eastern jet\n(knots A and B) and the western jet (knots C3, C2, C1 and\nD). The 43 GHz image reveals another knot (C4) located\nbetween B and C3. The knot C4 is similar to the component\nA15 by Kadler et al. (2004b), which is supposed to be the\ninnermost part of the eastern jet. In the 43 GHz image, knot\nA has poorly defined morphology, and knot C1 is split into\nseveral faint peaks. These images at different frequencies include uncertainty in absolute positional information through\nthe self-calibration process. For alignment of these images,\nwe used the relative positions of knots B, C1 and C2, which\nare clearly seen in the restored images with a 1.30\u00d70.49\nmas beam at 15, 22 and 43 GHz. Then we derived relative\noffsets to minimize the positional residuals (e.g. Kameno et\nal. 2001; Kameno et al. 2003; Sawada-Satoh et al. 2008).\nFinally, we could overlay the image at 15 GHz and 43 GHz\nwith the image at 22 GHz, with positional errors of (\u00b10.05,\n\u00b10.04) mas and (\u00b10.05, \u00b10.09) mas, in R.A. and DEC respectively.\n\nc 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n\n3.1 Free-Free Absorption Opacity Distribution\nAfter restoring with the same beam, we obtained spectral indices along the jets. The spectral indices indicate that most\nparts of the two-sided jet structure have optically thin synchrotron spectra at 15\u201343 GHz except at the inner edge of\nthe inner part of the both jets; a steeply rising spectrum\n43\n\u03b1\n(\u03b122\n15 = 3.2 \u00b1 0.1, \u03b122 = 3.1 \u00b1 0.1; S \u221d \u03bd ) at the western\nedge of knot B and at the eastern edge of knot C3 are revealed. The spectral index exceeds the theoretical limit for\nsynchrotron self-absorption (\u03b1 = 2.5). The highly rising\nspectrum of the inner edge of the both jets implies that the\nsynchrotron emission is obscured through the free-free absorption (FFA) by the foreground dense plasma, and this is\nconsistent with past multi-frequency observations (Kameno\net al. 2001; Vermeulen et al. 2003; Kadler et al. 2004b).\nFitting the continuum spectrum at 15\u201343 GHz to FFA\nmodel (S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 exp (\u2212\u03c4 \u03bd \u22122.1 )), we obtained FFA opacity (\u03c4 ) distributions along the jet axis (Fig. 2), which reveals\nthat high opacity (\u03c4 > 1000) is found in the inner edge of\nthe jets. It implies that the dense cold plasma cover \u223c2 mas\nin the inner edge, where the central engine is supposed to\nexist.\n3.2 H2 O maser emission\nSignificant H2 O maser emission within the velocity range\nof 1550\u20131850 km s\u22121 were detected, 50\u2013350 km s\u22121 redshifted from the systemic velocity of the galaxy, and it is\nconsistent with past single-dish observations (Braatz et al.\n1994, 1996; Braatz et al. 2003; Kameno et al. 2005). The\nmaser spots consist of two clusters; the eastern cluster and\nthe western cluster are located on knots B and C3, respectively. The H2 O masers projected on the approaching jet,\nor the eastern cluster were detected for the first time. In the\nwestern cluster, maser spots are distributed along the jet axis\ndirection that span \u223c1 mas (0.1 pc), and show some velocity\n\nwww.an-journal.org\n\n\fAstron. Nachr. / AN (2009)\n\nFig. 3 Relative distributions of H2 O maser spots (full circle) with respect to the continuum image at 22 GHz (contour). The inset box shows the detailed distributions of\nmaser spots.\nshift along the jet axis direction. Position-velocity diagrams\nof the H2 O maser spots along the jet axis (Fig. 4b) also reveal the trend of velocity gradient of \u223c 250 km s\u22121 mas\u22121\nin the western cluster. We note that Claussen et al. (1998)\nshowed a velocity gradient along the east-west direction of\nmagnitude \u223c 100 km s\u22121 mas\u22121 in the maser cluster on the\nwestern jet knot. A velocity gradient in the eastern cluster is\nnot obvious (Fig. 4a).\n3.3 Interpretation of the nuclear structure\nThe brightness temperature ratio between the approaching\nand receding jets is related to the viewing angle of the jet\naxis and the true jet speed. Assuming that knots A and C1\nform a symmetric pair of knots on either side of the nucleus,\ntheir intensity ratio R is given by\n\u00133\u2212\u03b1\n\u0012\nTbA\n1 + \u03b2 cos \u03b8\n(1)\nR = C1 =\n1 \u2212 \u03b2 cos \u03b8\nTb\nwhere TbA and TbC1 are the brightness temperature of knots\nA and C1, respectively, \u03b2 is the true jet velocity as a fraction\nof the speed of light (v/c), \u03b8 is the viewing angle of the jet\naxis, and \u03b1 is the spectral index. Adopting \u03b2 = 0.64 (Kadler\net al. 2004b) and \u03b1 = \u22121, the viewing angle is estimated to\nbe 79\u201380\u25e6 and 76\u201390\u25e6 using the flux density at 15 and 22\nGHz, respectively. Kadler et al. (2004b) obtained the minimum value of \u03b2 = 0.64 by taking the jet inclination derived\nby Vermeulen et al. (2003). The jet axis is considered to be\nnearly parallel to the sky plane.\nThere are two main ideas about what the H2 O masers\nof NGC 1052 are associated with, the jet or the circumnuclear torus (Claussen et al. 1998; Kameno et al. 2005). Here\nwe discuss the both ideas to account for the results from the\nobservations. One possible scenario is that the H2 O masers\nare associated with the circumnuclear torus with the X-ray\ndissociation region (XDR). The H2 O masers are distributed\nwhere the FFA opacity is large, and this suggests that the\nH2 O masers and the plasma exist close to each other.

A clear\nvelocity shift as a function of relative offset along the jet\naxis (P.A.=65\u25e6 in Fig. 2) is seen in the western cluster (b).\nOn the other hand, the eastern cluster seems to include several sub structures in velocity (a).\nthe case of the H2 O megamaser emission in NGC 4258,\nNeufeld & Maloney (1995) and Herrnstein et al. (1996) proposed that the molecular disk consists of several layers including a heated molecular layer where the H2 O masers reside.\nKameno et al. (2005) applied this idea to the circumnuclear torus model in NGC 1052. A hot (\u223c 8000 K) plasma\nlayer is created on the inner surface of the torus because of\nthe direct exposure to the X-ray radiation from the central\nsource. This layer is responsible for the free-free absorption. The XDR which lies immediately next to the plasma\nlayer inside the torus, is heated above \u223c 400 K as it is still\npartially irradiated by the X-ray radiation (Maloney 2002).\nExcited H2 O molecules in the XDR will amplify the continuum seed emission from the jet knots in the background and\nresult in maser emissions. The presence of masers on both\njets indicates the thickness of the torus along the orientation\nof the jet, covering at least knot B and C3. If the orientation\nof the jet axis is parallel to the sky plane, the thickness of\nthe torus should be therefore 0.2 pc at least. More dominant\nFFA and H2 O masers on the receding jet support the circumnuclear torus scenario, since the path length within the\ntorus toward the receding jet would be greater.\nThe FFA opacity \u03c4 is a function of the electron density\nne and temperature Te along the line of sight as\nZ\nn2e Te\u22121.5 dL\n(2)\n\u03c4 = 0.46\nLOS\n\nThe maximum opacity \u03c4 \u223c 1000 in the path length of \u223c\n1 pc gives n2e Te\u22121.5 = 2100. We can estimate the electron\ndensity ne \u2265 4.6 \u00d7 104 cm\u22123 using Ionization condition\nTe \u2265 104 K. The electron column density ne L would be\n1.4\u00d71023(Te /104 K)0.75 cm\u22122 , and the value is comparable\nto the atomic column density (\u223c 1023 cm\u22122 ) obtained by\nROSAT and ASCA X-day observations (Guainazzi &Antonelli 1999).\nIf the H2 O masers are associated with the torus, the redshifted spectrum of the H2 O maser emission would be accounted for by a contraction toward the central engine.

Sawada-Satoh et al.: A Dense Plasma in NGC 1052\n\nReferences\n\nFig. 5 A cartoon showing the possible environment in the\ncircumnuclear torus and jets in NGC 1052. Double-sided jet\naxis inclined by \u2265 76\u25e6 with respect to the line of sight. Inner surface of the torus is ionized by X-ray emission. XDR\nis formed on the inner layer of the torus and amplifies background continuum emission from the jet knot. On B and C3,\nwe can see the H2 O maser emission and FFA absorption as\nwell. On the other hand, only FFA appears on C2. Since\nthe gas inside the torus is falling toward the central engine,\nredshifted H2 O maser emission is detected.\npositional-velocity diagram along the jet axis for each maser\ncluster (figure 4) gives the appearance that the H2 O maser\ngas closer to the central engine is more redshifted. Such a\nvelocity shift as a function of positional offset could indicate the acceleration of the infalling gas toward the central\nengine. Thus, the circumnuclear torus scenario can explain\nthe observed characteristics.\nAlternatively, the H2 O masers could be excited by the\ninteraction between the jet and circumnuclear molecular gas\nas Claussen et al. (1998) proposed, and as interpreted in\nthe case of Mrk 348 (Peck et al. 2003). A weak point of\nthe jet excitation scenario is the difficulty to explain why\nthe eastern cluster of H2 O masers projected against the approaching jet is also redshifted. For the masers in the western cluster moving with the most redshifted velocity (\u223c\n400 km s\u22121 ) from the systemic velocity of the galaxy, the\nmaser gas should have moved 1.9\u00d710\u22123 pc eastward from\nNovember 1995 to July 2000, because the jet axis is close\nto the sky plane. This motion is too small to detect for the\nfive-year multi-epoch observations. Further VLBI observations are necessary in order to detect the proper motion of\nH2 O maser spots predicted by the jet excitation model, in\norder to support or refute this scenario.\n\nBraatz, J.A., Wilson, A.
