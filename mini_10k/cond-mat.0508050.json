Though a fluctuation mechanism could not\ninitially explain the high values of the observed transition\ntemperature for superconductivity, Tc [6] the phenomenology\nand self-consistent model used in the NMR data [7], showed\nthat a pairing mechanism with a constant interaction may lead\nto an order parameter of dx2-y2 symmetry with the values\nobserved for Tc. These predictions for the existence of dx2-y2\nsymmetry and the first direct experiments, confirming the\nexistence of such symmetry arose a great interest in carrying\nout the experiments [8] for determination of the symmetry of\norder parameter in HSTC.\nThe experimental method for determining the SOP is\na macroscopic one, based on the use of the dependence of\ntunnel current sensitivity in a Josephson contact on the phase\nof wave function of Cooper pair, which for a d-wave SOP\ndepends on the direction of k vector, though such a conclusion\nwas not immediately evident. In 1968 A.H. Silver and J.E.\nZimmerman [9] observed, for the first time, the half-value of\nquantum magnetic flow \u03c60, (\u03c60/2) in Josephson contact. Later,\nG.E. Volovik and V.P. Mineev [10] proposed for the first time,\nthat \u03c60/2 flow is connected with zeros of superfluid order\nparameter. Then B. Geshkenbein, A. Larkin and A. Barone\n[11] first noted that the tunnel current becomes zero, when the\nnormal to the surface is oriented along the direction, in which\nthe slit in the excitation spectrum is set to zero. Finally, M.\nSigrist and T. M. Rice in 1992 [12] suggested to use the\nsensitivity of Josephson effect to the jump of the SOP phase\nfor testing dx2-y2 symmetry in HTSC. Immediately after this,\nthe direct experiments were carried out to observe the d-wave\nSOP in the experiments of three types by using Jepheson\ncontacts. One type of experiments measured the interference\neffects [1-13], the second type measured the modulation of the\n\n1\n\ncritical current by magnetic fields [14] and the third type\nused the method of tri-crystal magnetometry of the rings\nof super-conducting epitaxial films, allowing to observe\nthe effect quantization of the magnetic flow with \u03c60/2 in\nthe YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 system (YBaCuO, GdBaCuO) Tl2201\nand Bi2212 films [15]. However, it should be noted that\neven now experiments are still carried out to investigate\nthe anisotropy of the super-conducting properties in\nHTSC, to ascertain whether the cause for the dx2-y2 SOP\nis determined by individual Cu atomic orbitals or the\nmacroscopic lattice effects [16]. Hartree Fock SCF\ncalculations of molecular orbitals also show that the\nhighest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) for Cu4O4\nextended states with continuous overlap of electron\nstates along the a/b diagonal direction in the CuO2 plane\ncan form Bose-Einstein pairs and that the O atoms are\nimportant in the superconducting wave function [16b,c].\nEXPERIMENTAL\nAmong the methods of the observation of the\nd-wave SOP in HTSC, the static mechanical method of\nmeasuring the magnetic moment, gave the first\nmacroscopic evidence for the possibility of of dx2-y2\nsymmetry, and for the measurements connected with\nthis anisotropy of internal pinning [17]. In the present\nwork we use the direct dynamic method of measuring\nthe energy losses, proposed earlier [18]. This method\ngives the possibility to investigate not only the\nanisotropy of internal pinning, but the anisotropy of\ndissipated energy in HTSC, caused by internal pinning.\nThe work deals just with the study of this anisotropy.\nThe method uses the oscillations of superconducting sample, suspended from the thin elastic\nthread in the magnetic field, which is perpendicular to\nits surface and creates the Abrikosov vortex lattice\n(AVL) [19]. The oscillation frequency of the sample is\nchanged when the vortex lines penetrate the sample. The\naction of the magnetic field on these vortices makes\ncontribution to the torque of suspended system [20,21].\nAt small oscillation amplitude, the main mass of vortices\n\n\fis fixed on pinning centers, thereby causing the change of the\noscillation frequency. As the oscillation amplitude increases,\nthe most weakly fixed vortices begin to separate from the\npinning centers, leading to an additional dissipation of energy,\nconnected with their following motion in the volume of\nsuperconductor.\nThe theoretical analysis of our experiments in 1973\nfor superconductors of the II type [20, 21], allowed V.P.\nGalaiko to predict that even at small values of oscillation\namplitudes there is a finite concentration of free, Cfr and\nlocked, Clc vortices, the interaction between which causes\nenergy dissipation [22]. Further, these experiments were\ncarried out on ceramic samples of high-temperature\nsuperconductors and the elastic-viscous properties of\nAbrikosov vortex structure were studied [23-24]. When a\nsingle crystal HTSC sample is suspended from a thin and\nelastic thread, with the c-axis parallel to the oscillation axis of\nthe suspended system and the external magnetic field, H0>Hcl\nis directed normal to c-axis in basal plane ab, the energy\ndissipation can be measured as a function of angle of rotation \u03b8\nin basal plane. The anisotropy of the dissipation energy\nmeasured is determined by the internal pinning of hightemperature superconductor. We describe experiments carried\nout on YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 single crystals of 2.1x1.75x0.2mm3\ndimensions, fabricated in the laboratory of Thomas Wolf in\nKarlsruhe (Germany). The apparatus for measuring the\nanisotropy of the dissipation energy processes in a singlecrystal HTSC (FIG. 1) consists of 1: a crystal holder that\nplaces its c-axis parallel to the axis of 2: an aligned glass rod\nwhich is a part of 3: a light disc made of duraluminum on its\nupper part with a moment of inertia I = 2.255 gr.cm2. Rod 2 is\nsuspended from 4: a thin elastic thread made of phosphor\nbronze (radius=50\u03bcm, length=170mm) that makes axialtorsional oscillations at time intervals registered by 5: a mirror\nreflecting light on: 6: two photo-sensors placed at a fixed\ndistance from each other [25]. The assembly 1 to 5 was\ncontained in a Dewar in at T= 90K. The logarithmic decrement\nof oscillation damping \u03b4ab is measured by the time interval\nfrom the oscillating mirror 5 reflections, between the photo\nsensors, located in the center, 6 was used for measuring the\noscillation frequency of suspended system. By means of\nelectronic unit the information from these sensors entered the\ncomputer, which processed the information and controlled the\nexperiment. The magnetic field perpendicular to oscillating\nsystem and to c-axis of the sample was created by 7: an\nelectromagnet which could be rotated about the vertical axis\nallowing us to study the anisotropy of dissipation processes in\nthe basal plane of single crystal HTSC. A small uniform\nmagnetic field could created in any direction by 8, 9, 10:\nadditional Helmholtz coils, placed in the lower part of\nsuspended system.\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic of the\napparatus used for the\ninvestigation of dissipation\nprocesses in superconductors:\n1: crystal holder, 2: aligned\nglass rod, 3: disc, 4: thread\nmade of phosphor bronze, 5:\nmirror, 6: photo sensors, 7:\nelectromagnet, 8, 9, 10:\nHelmholtz coils.\n\nFIG. 2: Dependence of logarithmic decrement of oscillation\ndamping \u03b4 on \u03b8ab angle in the basal plane of the single crystal.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe measurement of the anisotropy of the dissipation\nprocesses (FIG. 2, 3) connected with internal pinning in single\ncrystal high-temperature YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 superconductor is\ndescribed as follows:\n\n2\n\nFIG. 3: Dependence of the pinning force Fp on the \u03b8ab angle\nin the basal plane of single crystal.\n\n\fThe four minima in \u03b4ab in the basal plane: \u03c0/2, \u03c0, 3\u03c0/2\nand 2\u03c0 (FIG. 2) indicate that when vortices are oriented along\nthese directions, the energy dissipation is maximum when\nmeasurements are carried out at H=200Oe, T=90 K.\nSince the anisotropy of energy dissipation in the basal\nplane is caused by internal pinning, it is important to also\ndetermine the nature of the dependence of the internal pinning\nforce on the direction of external magnetic field with respect to\na and b axes in the basal plane. Due to the low magnitude of\npinning force in the small fields, the experiment was carried\nout at H=4200Oe, T=90K. In order to measure the pinning\nforce, we use a specially developed mechanical (currentless)\nmethod [26] for direct measurement of pinning force in\nsuperconductors. The method is based on the measurements of\ncounter moments of the forces acting on the superconducting\nsample from the side of magnetic field and torsion head. We\nmeasure the dependence of the angle of rotation of sample \u03c62\non the angle of rotation of torsion head \u03c61, rotation of which is\npassed to the super-conducting sample by the thread of\nsuspension. In order to avoid the phenomena of inertia, the\ntorsion head was rotated with low constant velocity \u03c9=4.7*10-3\nrad.sec-1. According to the dependence of \u03c62 on \u03c61, one can\ndetermine the torque \u03c4 acting on super-conducting sample,\nwhich appears as the deviation of vortex ensemble from the\ndirection of external magnetic field and at the rotation of upper\nhead \u03c4~K(\u03c61- \u03c62), where K is the stiffness factor of the\nsuspended system. By measuring the dependence of the torque\non the angle of rotation \u03b8ab between the direction of external\nmagnetic field with respect to a and b axes of the basal plane,\none can obtain the information on the character of the\nanisotropy of internal pinning in ab plane. The experiments\n(FIG. 3) show the dependence of internal pinning force on the\nangle between the external magnetic field H and the direction\nof basal axes in standard units, and clearly distinguish\ndirections \u03c0/2, \u03c0, 3\u03c0/2 and 2\u03c0, corresponding to the\norientations of vortices along a and b axes. In these directions\nthe internal pinning has maximum. The rectangular superconducting single crystal is not of disc shape, the lengths of\nvortices in different directions are not equal. Fp is greater along\none direction, \u03b8ab=\u03c0/4 over \u03b8ab=3\u03c0/4 by ~ 20 % which may be\nrelated to the sample dimensions, is much less than the\nmaximum difference in pinning force versus \u03b8ab (FIG. 3).\nCONCLUSION\nThe characteristic curves of energy dissipation (FIG.\n2) and pinning forces (FIG. 3) are consistent with dx2-y2 SOP.\n\n4\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n10\n11\n\n12\n13\n14\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nWork was supported by ISTC G-389 grant.\n\n24\n\nREFERENCES\n1\n\n2\n3\n\n(a) D.
