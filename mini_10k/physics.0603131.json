After a brief introduction to the NIST EBIT facility, we present the results of three\ndifferent types of experiments that have been carried out there recently: EUV and visible\nspectroscopy in support of the microelectronics industry, laboratory astrophysics using an x-ray\nmicrocalorimeter, and charge exchange studies using extracted beams of highly charged ions.\n\nTHE NIST EBIT FACILITY: HISTORY AND OVERVIEW\nElectron Beam Ion Traps (EBITs) emerged on the world scene in 1988 with the\npublication of the first results by the Livermore-LBL collaboration [1]. Results that\ndepended critically on high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy with an EBIT appeared in\nthe Physical Review in 1989 [2], using an NRL-NIST spectrometer at Livermore, in\ncollaboration with P. Beiersdorfer. This work followed some other important EBIT\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy work presented earlier in various conference\nproceedings. Two years later, construction of a new EBIT laboratory at NIST began,\nin collaboration with NRL, and two years after that (1993) we began trapping ions and\npublishing papers from the NIST facility. A compilation of the early Livermore EBIT\npapers was published in 1992 [3]. Recently, we published a bound collection of the\nNIST EBIT publications through 2001, which is available in hardcopy and CD from\nNIST [4]. The NIST compilation also contains some previously unpublished\nhistorical information about both the NIST and LLNL EBITs (written by the first\nauthor of the present paper, and by Ross Marrs of LLNL).\nThe NIST EBIT incorporates a number of design changes that are intended to allow\nit to reach higher beam energies than those obtained in the EBIT-I and EBIT-II at\n\n\fLLNL. The upper energy limit of the NIST machine has not yet been tested, although\nit has been run as high as 33 keV as well as below 100 eV. We have produced charge\nstates as high q=73+ in bismuth ions, and at 33 keV should be able to produce strong\nspectra from any Ne-like ion on the periodic table. The drift tube structure is not\nexpected to hold more than 40 keV, but the upper range of the beam energy might\nexceed 50 keV if the electron gun and cathode are floated to negative high voltages, as\nthey are in the LLNL SuperEBIT [5]. The NIST EBIT electron gun and collector rest\non small internal high voltage platforms to enable this mode of operation, although\nthere has been so much physics to explore below 30 keV to date that the platforms\nhave only been run at ground potentials. For reference, we note that 33 keV is equal\nto the threshold energy needed to produce He-like U90+ ions, although we would not\nexpect to produce many such ions near threshold, and have not tried to do so. A\nSuperEBIT of the sort available at LLNL [5], Tokyo [6], or Heidelberg [7], with\nenergies near 200 keV, is necessary in order to produce significant quantities of the\nhighest few percent of all the possible charge states on the periodic table.\nThe NIST EBIT facility is also equipped with an ion-extraction beamline for ionsolid and ion-gas collision studies. The general technique of extracting ions from an\nEBIT was pioneered at Livermore [8], but the design of the NIST beamline resulted in\non-target beam currents of Xe44+ ions that were 100 times higher than previously\nreported from an EBIT (1000x times higher in continuous beam mode) [9]. This\nsubstantial improvement (reaching 10's of pA) enabled new classes of experiments\nwith highly charged ion beams (see, e.g., the section on charge exchange below).\n\nEUV AND VISIBLE SPECTROSCOPY OF XENON\nIn support of the development of EUV Lithography (EUVL) [10] light sources for\nthe microelectronics industry, we have produced benchmark EUV spectra of Xe ions\nfor testing plasma models. Xe charge states around q=10+ emit strongly around 13.5\nnm wavelength, where highly efficient multilayer optics have been developed for\nlithography applications. The lines in this region of the spectrum appear densely\npacked, even when observed with the world's largest (10.7 m) grazing incidence\nspectrometer, located at NIST [11]. To study the intensity envelope of this group of\nlines (as well as the even stronger group around 11 nm) with the NIST EBIT, we have\nconstructed an ultrahigh vacuum EUV spectrometer, based on a variable line space\n(VLS) flat-field grating. Figure 1 shows an example of one of our early EUV spectra.\n\nFIGURE 1. EUV spectrum of Xe taken at 1.5 keV electron beam energy.\n\n\fTo complement these EUV studies, we have also observed Xe in the x-ray and, as\nshown in figure 2, the visible region of the spectrum. The two lines marked on the left\nside of this spectrum demonstrate the improvement in our spectroscopy system since\nour 1995 publication that reported the first visible/uv spectroscopy on an EBIT [12].\nIn comparison to figure 1 of our earlier work [12], we can now obtain spectra with\nmuch higher resolution, much higher signal-to-noise ratio, and much broader spectral\nrange, in a fraction of the time.\nWe note that the strongest line in figure 2 (near 598 nm) is particularly interesting\nin that it arises from the charge state q=9+ that is adjacent to the q=10+ charge state\nthat future EUVL systems might be based on in the microelectronics industry. We\npropose that this line might be useful for real-time diagnostics of EUVL light sources.\nFor completeness, we note that the Livermore EBIT group has previously reported\na line that is essentially at the same wavelength as the one we measure at 598 nm, but\nwhich they identify as arising from a much higher charge state (q=31+) [13]. We have\ntried to search for a possible coincidental line overlap by scanning the electron beam\nenergy and looking for a slight shift in measured wavelength or intensity, but we have\nfound no evidence for the existence of two lines at this location. The line position\nreported by the LLNL group is at 598.40(100) nm and is identified to be from a 3d5\n4\nG9/2- 4G11/2 transition in Xe31+, while our observed line position is at 597.98(50) nm\nand arises from the 4d9 2D3/2- 2D5/2 transition in Xe9+. We can be certain that the line\nwe see does not arise from q=31+ because it remains strong at 500 eV beam energy\n(fig 3a), nearly a factor of 4 below the 1.8 keV energy needed to produce Xe31+.\nFurther evidence supporting our identification of the charge state is provided by the\nfact that the line disappears when the beam energy is dropped below the 180 eV\nenergy needed to produce Xe9+ (fig. 3b). These measurements illustrate the power of\nan EBIT, when put to full use, to aid in the definitive identification of spectral lines.\n\nFIGURE 2. Spectrum of Xe taken at 3 keV electron beam energy.\n\n\fFIGURE 3. Portion of visible Xe spectrum, taken at beam energies of (A) 500 eV and (B) 100 eV.\n\nX-RAY MICROCALORIMETRY\nWith the award of the Nobel Prize in 2002 for the birth of x-ray astronomy, and the\nlaunch of the spectacular orbiting x-ray observatories Chandra and XMM Newton in\n1999, it is an exciting time to be involved in x-ray astronomy. The present era has\nbeen likened to the early days of optical spectroscopy, when spectral lines visible to\nthe eye were just being highly resolved for the first time. Future generations of x-ray\nobservatories are being planned that will use new types of high-resolution\nspectrometers that are based on photon calorimetry rather than diffraction from a\ngrating or crystal. Shortly before the launch of Chandra and XMM Newton, the\nHarvard-Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (Harvard-SAO) began a\ncollaboration with us to test the development of x-ray microcalorimeters, and to\ndeploy them for laboratory astrophysics using the NIST EBIT to simulate the hot\nplasmas that were soon to be studied by the orbiting observatories. The particular\nmicrocalorimeters and associated electronics deployed at NIST were built entirely at\nHarvard-SAO and Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in recent years (except for\ncommercial dewars) and have not been deployed previously at other EBIT facilities.\nSince the publication of our initial results on the astrophysically relevant Fe XVII\nspectrum [14], the Livermore EBIT group has also published some FeXVII results\nusing a NASA-GSFC microcalorimeter [15]. The experimental results have\nstimulated significant theoretical activity, including that of Chen and Pradhan [16]\nwho have carried out what is described as possibly the largest electron-ion scattering\ncalculation to date (a relativistic close-coupling calculation with Hamiltonian matrix\ndimension up to 10,286). Prior to this calculation, the astrophysical observations were\nnot comfortably reconcilable with either theory or our measurements (although some\nof the astrophysical line ratios did agree with the later results from the Livermore\nEBIT group [15]). The new calculations, however, show strong resonances along the\nenergy axis and suggest that our measurements are actually the ones in better\nagreement with both theory and astrophysical observations, once the\nenergy/temperature dependence is taken into account (figure 2 of reference [16]).\nIndependent of the astrophysical observations, we can say that while some of the line\nratios measured in the LLNL experiment are in relatively good agreement with our\nresults, other ratios disagree at the 2-sigma to 3-sigma level. We are presently starting\n\n\fa new set of measurements to investigate the significance of this discrepancy further,\nas well as to study other spectra of interest.\nRecently, both the LLNL and the NIST EBIT groups have deployed new (2nd\ngeneration) microcalorimeters in their labs. At the present conference, the LLNL\ngroup emphasized the performance improvements in their new microcalorimeter, as\ncompared to our old instrument, so we point out here the corresponding improvements\nin our instrument as well. During a recent set of first measurements on the NIST\nEBIT, our new microcalorimeter obtained a resolution improved slightly from 6 eV\n[17] to 5.5 eV (3.0 eV at 6 keV photon energy has been obtained under more optimal\nconditions at SAO). The microcalorimeter at LLNL has improved from 11.5 eV to 6.5\neV (at a photon energy of 6.7 eV, a temperature of 60 mk, and for 14 summed pixels\n[18]). The total number of active pixels is 32 at LLNL [18] and 4 at NIST. Some of\nthe early measurements at NIST used an x-ray lens that boosted the light intensity per\npixel by up to a factor of 100 [19], rather than using more pixels to collect the\nnaturally distributed light. The maximum count rate/pixel is limited by the pulse\ndecay time, which is 1 ms in both instruments used at NIST, and has improved to 3 ms\nin the new instrument used at LLNL [20]. The pixel size is 0.624x0.624 mm2 at\nLLNL [20] and 0.4x0.4 mm2 at NIST. Our \"hold time\" (amount of time that it can be\nrun continuously, before having to shut down and refresh the adiabatic\ndemagnetization refrigerator), has improved from 10 hours to >24 hours, while the\nLLNL hold time has improved from 5 hours to >12 hours [18].\nBecause of the apparent discrepancy between the NIST and the LLNL Fe XVII\nmeasurements, a number of remarks have been published [15] by the LLNL group that\nrequire clarification. The most substantive ones are discussed below (this discussion\nis by the first author of the present paper, and should not necessarily be attributed to\nall of the other coauthors, only some of whom participated in the relevant\nexperiments).\nContrary to the claim that the NIST EBIT suffers \"performance limitations\" and\nwill not operate below 700 eV [15], figure 3 above demonstrates that it indeed\noperates quite well at energies as low at 100 eV. In fact, the NIST EBIT has operated\nsignificantly below 100 eV since the first time it was attempted, in January 2000. Like\nall EBITs (including the LLNL EBIT [18]), however, ours does show an increase in\nsnout/anode current when operated at low beam energies [21]. This is typically\ncompensated for by lowering the beam current.\nIt has been suggested [15] that the NIST EBIT operates at higher beam\ntemperatures than the LLNL EBIT. There are two possible meanings of \"beam\ntemperature\": (1) overall beam temperature, or full energy spread, and (b) transverse\nbeam temperature. Regarding the first, the paper cited by LLNL in [15] concerning\nthis issue determined their beam temperature to be 50 eV [22], larger than the 45 eV\nvalue determined previously for the NIST EBIT [23]. The actual value for the NIST\nEBIT during the Fe XVII experiment is likely to have been even less since we\noperated at reduced beam currents (one component of the temperature is proportional\nto the space charge, which scales linearly with beam current).\nRegarding the second type of beam temperature, the relevant paper [24] referenced\nby the LLNL group in [15] quotes us [21] as saying that 700 eV is our estimate for the\ntransverse beam temperature of the NIST EBIT, whereas in fact we only proposed that\n\n\fthis was an upper bound. The LLNL group [24] specifies their own transverse beam\ntemperature to be 190(30) eV (revised upwards from their earlier estimate of 110 eV\n[25]), reported to be in agreement with a theoretical prediction of 194 eV. Their\ntheoretical prediction, however, is based on an imprecise value for one of the critical\nconstants in the theory (the beam radius at the cathode). When the actual value [21,\n26] for this constant is used, the theoretical prediction increases to 440 eV.\nFurthermore, the LLNL group obtained their experimental value of 190 eV from a set\nof determinations that ranged from \u201335 eV to +1920 eV (nearly 3 times our upper\nbound). They discarded half of these results, \"even if the residuals intimate an\nexcellent fit\" [24], and averaged the remaining 6 points, even though these remaining\npoints still showed a wide scatter (spanning 6-sigma of the final quoted uncertainty).\nIt is clear from the details of their analysis that the spread in the 6 determinations is\ndue primarily to a non-random systematic error arising from an improper form of the\nfitting function. It is therefore inappropriate that they quoted an uncertainty reduced\nbelow the standard deviation by the square root of the number of determinations [27].\nIf they had not discarded half of their determinations, they would have arrived at a\nmean value of 566 eV, in good agreement with the corrected theoretical prediction and\nmuch closer to our upper bound.\nIt has been claimed that the NIST EBIT does not operate under collisional\nequilibrium (citing evidence that Fe XVII lines do not appear in the LLNL\nmeasurements beyond 1.5 keV, whereas they do appear in the NIST measurements at\nthese energies) [15]. The rapid approach to collisional equilibrium (<15 ms) has been\ndemonstrated in figure 3 of our earlier work [28], for a range of charge states of Kr,\nfrom q=1 to q=22. In our Fe XVII experiment, the trapping time was 1.0 s [29],\nsignificantly longer than the time needed to reach collisional equilibrium in that\nsystem. The fact that Fe XVII lines do not appear in the LLNL measurements for\nbeam energies beyond 1.5 keV can be easily explained by the lack of ion cooling gas\nin their experiment. Using an EBIT simulation code developed at LLNL [30], we\nhave modeled the cases of no cooling gas, P<5x10-11 hPa (torr), and moderate amounts\nof cooling gas, P=5x10-9 hPa (torr), and found that in the former case the\nconcentration of Fe XVII is reduced to zero above 1.5 keV, while in the latter case it is\nonly rapidly reduced to a local minimum (still far above zero) around 4 keV, and then\ngrows modestly up to (and beyond) 10 keV. We conclude that the difference in\nobserved behavior between the LLNL and NIST EBIT is the normal result of charge\nexchange from the cooling gas, and does not imply a lack of collisional equilibrium in\neither one of the devices.\nIt was claimed in [15] that an earlier LLNL paper [31] proved that a substantial\nfraction of Fe XVI contaminated the NIST 3C/3D line ratio. In fact, the LLNL paper\n[31] showed only that Fe XVI contaminated some of their own work, not the NIST\nwork. The only way the LLNL group was able to obtain significant contamination in\ntheir spectra was to continuously inject neutral Fe in a gaseous form. When they used\npulsed MEVVA ion injection (as we did at NIST) the contamination was negligible.\nAs pointed out by Chen and Pradhan [16], both the published LLNL and the NIST\n3C/3D ratios are in good agreement with each other (and with theory) once the energy\ndependence is taken into account (at least at the energies calculated with resonances).\n\n\fIt was correctly pointed out [15] that the NIST Fe XVII data was not time-resolved.\nIndeed, we summed and reported every photon emitted during the normal course of\nthe experiment. Although not described explicitly in their paper [15], the LLNL group\ndiscarded photons that were detected in the period just after iron injection, and\nanalyzed only those that were detected after a certain delay time [18]. Although the\ndifference is significant in principle, in practice it will not affect the final results much\nif the trapping time is long compared to the time to reach collisional equilibrium.\nIt was pointed out that our \"calorimeter response was not calibrated or monitored\nin-situ\" [15]. The response of our calorimeter was determined initially (including\nwindow transmission) and observed to be stable during the experiment. Because of\nthe high overall stability, the much smaller differential changes in the response curve\nbetween nearby wavelengths should be entirely negligible. As calculated in our paper\n[14], it would take a huge window contamination layer, equal to twice our window\nthickness itself in the case calculated, to shift our most sensitive line ratios outside of\nour quoted error bars. We believe this is very unlikely.\nFinally, we note a significant difference in the adjustment (or lack thereof) of the\nline ratios that were actually observed in the NIST and LLNL EBITs-a difference\npreviously unappreciated by the LLNL group that appears to have led them to an\nincorrect comparison of one set of results to another in their figure 2 [15] and in their\ninvited talk at the present conference [18]. As described in our papers, we report line\nratios that are \"as observed\" (i.e. from a real EBIT under specified conditions)-there\nare no adjustments based on theory. The LLNL group, in contrast, adjusts their\nobserved values (using theory) to obtain results that would have been observed if their\nEBIT were more similar to some astrophysical sources (for example, not having an\nelectron beam that is unidirectional and oriented 90-degrees to the observation vector).\nIn our view, such adjustments should be a part of the theory that explains the\nexperimental data, not the other way around (compare our figure 3 [14], which shows\nthe effect of the anisotropic emission in the theory, for a range of allowed possibilities,\nrather than as a fixed offset in the experiment). Once the two sets of data are plotted\non equal footing, the apparent discrepancy is significantly reduced.\n\nCHARGE EXCHANGE STUDIES\nWith the surprising discovery of the emission of x-rays (typically corresponding to\nvery high temperatures) from comets (\"dirty snowballs\"), and the subsequent\nexplanation of this effect in terms of charge exchange with the solar wind, studies\nrelated to the capture of electrons from gasses by highly charged ions have become\npopular (for a review, see [32]). The LLNL EBIT was deployed to address the\ncometary x-ray problem using a technique in which the electron beam is switched off\nand low-level x-ray emission is observed to persist from the magnetically trapped ions\ndue to charge exchange with the background gas inside the EBIT [33]. Motivated not\nonly by the cometary x-ray problem, but also by the need for a better understanding of\ncharge exchange processes in research involving controlled thermonuclear fusion and\nEUV lithography, we have been engaged in charge exchange studies using a\n\n\fcomplementary technique, since the year 2000. In our experiments [34-35], the range\nof charge states present in the EBIT are extracted and passed through a q/m selecting\nmagnet, and then directed through an aperture into a differentially pumped chamber\nwhich contains a gas jet target. We observe the x rays emitted from the interaction of\nthe ion beam with the jet, using a high purity Ge detector. This method is also\ncomplementary to the LLNL method in that ours involves collision velocities that\ntypically are much higher (well-matched to those in the solar wind), although we can\nalso adjust our beams to span the range of velocities from above 800 km/s to below 30\nkm/s. The velocity dependence of the measured and calculated \"x-ray hardness\nfactor\" has been presented in figure 33 of a recent review article by Beiersdorfer [36].\nOur results for Ne projectiles that are fully stripped before electron capture agree well\nwith the experiment of Greenwood, et. al [37] shown in that plot [36].\nIn order to learn more about the details of the capture process, one can look at the\nfull spectral signature of the x-ray emission. In figure 4, we show this for the case of\nAr projectiles, now adding some complexity to the problem by leaving one electron on\nthe projectile (before electron capture and emission in the He-like state).\nWe have been working with several sets of theorists to model this spectrum and\ngain insight into the quantum state-specific (n, l) initial capture distribution. The\nresult of several single-electron capture distributions calculated for our argon\nprojectiles with the Classical Trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC) method, following\n[38], and a version of the Landau-Zener (MCLZ) method, following [39], are shown\nin figure 5 (both include capture only from the Ar 3p shell). These distributions are\nused as input to a separate calculation, following [40], of the photon emission that\noccurs as the excited ion cascades to the ground state. The final results is shown in\nthe curves plotted in figure 4. The discrepancy with the LZ model at the highest x-ray\nenergies might be due to the neglect of multiple electron capture, anisotropic emission\n(polarization effects), or variation in the triplet-singlet population ratio (among other\npossibilities). We are currently engaged in a dynamic interplay between experiment\nand theory in attempt to reduce the disagreements and improve the understanding of\nthe underlying physical processes in these and the other studies described in this\npaper.\nA variety of other experiments are under way at the NIST EBIT facility, including\ncontinued studies in the area of ion-surface interactions [41] and precision\nmeasurements of the effect of the quantum vacuum on atomic structure [42].\n\n\fFIGURE 4.
