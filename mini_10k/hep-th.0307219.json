Using the\nmodel assumption that the two-dimensional closed vortex world-surfaces can be regarded as\nrandom surfaces in four-dimensional (Euclidean) space-time, the principal phenomena characterizing low-energy strong interaction physics can be successfully described, i.e., confinement,\nthe spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and the axial UA (1) anomaly [2, 3, 4]. This picture was inspired and is corroborated by lattice experiments [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] in which the vortex\ncontent of lattice Yang-Mills configurations is extracted and subsequently used to assess the\nsignificance of the vortex degrees of freedom for the phenomenology of the strong interaction\nvacuum.\nIn particular, the gluonic topological charge entering the UA (1) anomaly can be understood in terms of the topology of the vortex world-surfaces [3, 4, 10, 11, 12]. Topological\ncharge associated with center vortex world-surfaces is generated in two different ways, selfintersections of the surfaces and writhe. In realistic random surface ensembles, the latter is\nstatistically by far the more important [3, 13].\nOn the other hand, the intuition gained hitherto from considering lattice-generated \"cubistic\" vortex surfaces [3, 4, 12] can be misleading when trying to understand the more\nsubtle writhe of continuum vortex surfaces. To understand why, consider as a simple twodimensional analogue the continuum and lattice versions of a \"figure 8\", i.e. a closed selfintersecting line in a plane, as shown in Fig. 1. As will be discussed below, in four dimensions,\nlattice topological charge appears where the set of tangent vectors to the vortex spans all four\ndimensions of space-time. In the two-dimensional analogue of Fig. 1, the tangent vectors to\nthe \"figure 8\" span both dimensions of the plane at the self-intersection point, where two\nbranches of the line provide two linear independent tangent vectors. In addition, this is true\nfor all the corners of the lattice \"figure 8\", since the line bends in an abrupt way, resulting\nin two linearly independent tangent vectors from one branch (as limits from \"before\" and\n\"after\" the point). Such a behaviour is the analogue of writhe in the case of four-dimensional\nthin lattice vortices. However, at first sight, it does not seem to be present for the continuum\n\"figure 8\", where the tangent space is of course one-dimensional everywhere except at the\nself-intersection point!\n2\n\n\fFIG. 1: Left: Continuum \"figure 8\" in a plane (e.g., a lemniscate); right: coarse-grained lattice\n\"figure 8\".\n\nThe purpose of the present note is to provide a simple, pedagogical, explicit example\nof a continuum vortex configuration illustrating how topological charge density arises. In\nparticular, the contribution from vortex writhe is elucidated. It turns out that continuum\nwrithe is spread smoothly over the surface and arises in connection with certain combinations\nof gradients of the tangent vectors.\nThe example to be discussed here is formulated within the framework of SU(2) gauge\ntheory. The gluonic fields of this particular example will, however, point into a fixed color\ndirection throughout space-time. Thus, the problem to be treated below is essentially an\nAbelian one.\n\nII.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE VORTEX WORLD-SURFACE\n\nConsider the vortex world-surface depicted in Fig. 2, which was first introduced in [3] and\nsubsequently also studied in [12]. It is composed of elementary squares on a (Euclidean)\nfour-dimensional hypercubic lattice. Due to the coarse-grained nature of the underlying\nlattice, changes in the vortex shape as time evolves can only take place abruptly, at the times\nt = \u22121, 0, 1, cf. Fig. 3.\n\nAs a first step towards finding a continuum analogue, make the time evolution gradual1 ,\n\nas depicted in Fig. 4.\nIn other words, open a planar loop and then pull and simultaneously twist the bottom of\nit in a corkscrew motion around a vertical axis by the angle \u03c0, while holding the top fixed\n1\n\nA similar, but not identical, smoothing of the time evolution was considered in [12].\n\n3\n\n\ft=1\nt=0\n\nr3\nr1\n\nt=-1\n\nr2\nFIG. 2: Example vortex world-surface configuration composed of elementary squares on a (Euclidean) four-dimensional hypercubic lattice, taken from [3]. At each lattice time slice, t \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1},\nshaded squares are part of the vortex surface. These squares are furthermore connected to squares\nrunning in the time direction; their location can be inferred most easily by keeping in mind that\neach edge (lattice link) of the configuration is connected to exactly two squares, i.e., the surface\nis closed. The surface possesses one isolated point at which its self-intersects, at the center of the\nconfiguration, and no self-intersection lines. Note that the two non-shaded squares at t = 0 are not\npart of the vortex; only the two sets of three links bounding them are. These are slices at t = 0\nof surface segments running in time direction from t = \u22121 through to t = 1; sliced at t = 0, these\nsurface segments show up as lines.\n\nt<-1\n\n-1<t<0\n\n0<t<1\n\n1<t\n\nFIG. 3: Viewing the vortex world-surface depicted in Fig. 2 in terms of the time evolution of a\nvortex line in three-dimensional space, there are only four distinct stages of the time evolution,\nduring which the vortex shape remains constant.\n\n4\n\n\ft=-0.9\n\nt=-0.6\n\nt=-0.3\n\nt=0-\n\nt=0+\n\nt=0.3\n\nt=0.6\n\nt=0.9\n\nFIG. 4: Continuous, gradual time dependence of a vortex loop going through the stages depicted in\nFig. 3, but without discontinuous changes in the shape of the loop as time evolves.\n\n(t = \u22120.9 through t = \u22120.3). Then let the vortex line intersect itself, as depicted by the\nimages at t = \u22120.3 through t = 0.3. Afterwards, twist again by the angle \u03c0 such that the\nshapes at the times t = 0.3 through t = 0.9 are mirror images of the shapes seen at the\ncorresponding times \u2212t, cf. Fig. 4. Thus, one arrives again at a simple planar loop which\nthen closes. Note that in the representation of Fig. 4, and also of Fig. 5, in the last stage of\nthe time evolution it is the top of the loop which is corkscrewed back into the (approximately\nfixed) bottom part. If one however considers the relative motion of the bottom with respect\nto the top, one sees that the bottom rotates with respect to the top by the angle \u03c0 in the\nsame direction as in the initial stage. The writhe in this configuration, to be discussed in\ndetail further below, comes from this 2\u03c0 rotation of the two ends of the loop with respect to\neach other; such a rotation of course is only possible if one concomitantly allows the loop to\nself-intersect once. As will be exhibited explicitly below, these two actions are each associated\nwith topological charge contributions of modulus 1/2, which cancel each other to give global\ntopological charge zero.\nAs the second step towards a smooth continuum surface, all that remains is to smoothen\nout the corners of the loops depicted in Fig. 4, cf. Fig. 5.\nThis completes the construction of a smooth continuum analogue of the lattice surface2\n2\n\nNote that the discussion of topological charge in [10] is in some respects too restricted in that it does not\nencompass the smooth continuum surface discussed here, which contains a single intersection point. In [10],\nit is assumed that intersection points of smooth surfaces occur in pairs. The formulation in the published\nversion of [10] is already sufficiently careful to take into account the lattice version, Fig. 2, by allowing for\nother singular points on surfaces besides intersection points (by that time, one of the authors had happened\nupon Fig. 2, cf. [3]). Singular points are those points where the tangent vectors to the vortex configuration\n\n5\n\n\ft=-0.9\n\nt=-0.6\n\nt=-0.3\n\nt=0-\n\nt=0+\n\nt=0.3\n\nt=0.6\n\nt=0.9\n\nFIG. 5: Spatial shape of the loop displayed in Fig. 4 smoothed out to yield an altogether smooth\nvortex world-surface.\n\nshown in Fig. 2. A convenient parametrization of the complete world-surface is the following\n(the source of this parametrization will be further commented upon below):\n\ny(s1 , s2 ) =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a \uf8f6\n\uf8ec \u2212 cos s1 (cos s2 + sin s2 )/ 2 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u221a \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u2212 cos s1 (cos s2 \u2212 sin s2 )/ 2 \uf8f7\n\uf8eb\n\nsin 2s2 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\u2212 sin s1 cos s2\nsin s1 sin s2\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n,\n\ns1 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0] , s2 \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2]\n\n(1)\n\nIn fact, Fig. 5 was generated using this parametrization; details on how to extract closed\nvortex loops in three-dimensional space from (1) at fixed times t \u2261 y1 (s1 , s2 ) are given in\nAppendix A. In plotting Fig. 5, the viewing angle of the observer at the different times\ndisplayed was adjusted such as to best match the viewing angle of Figs. 2-4. The worldsurface parametrized by eq. (1) will serve to illustrate how topological charge density arises\nfrom writhe of smooth continuum vortex surfaces, which is the central objective of the present\nwork.\nSpecifying the space-time location of the vortex world-surface does not completely determine a vortex configuration. It does determine the structure of the moduli of the gluonic\n2\nfield strength tensor components, Trcolor F\u03bc\u03bd\n, for each \u03bc, \u03bd, which are concentrated on the\n\nvortex surface in a way which will be described more explicitly in the next section; however,\na\nit still leaves the color direction of the field strength tensor components, F\u03bc\u03bd\n, free. Even if\n\none assumes F a to be aligned with the three-direction in color space3 , F a = F \u03b4 a3 , then there\n\n3\n\nspan all four dimensions of space-time.\nSince at generic points on a vortex surface, there is only one nonvanishing field strength tensor component\n(details follow further below), this can usually be achieved via a gauge transformation, which will be\nassumed to have been done within the present treatment. The field strength associated with the vortex\nworld-surface (1) constructed explicitly further below will indeed be of the form F a = F \u03b4 a3 .\n\n6\n\n\fstill remains a freedom in the sign of F , which can be viewed as a choice of the orientation\nof the vortex world-surface.\nOrientation can be assigned to a surface by locally associating a sense of curl with the\nsurface elements it is made up of. The reader is invited to do so with the surface of Fig. 2; for\neach elementary square making up the surface, define a curl in the sense of a definite order\nof running around the four edges of the square. If it is possible to define curls for all squares\nsuch that all pairs of squares sharing an edge (i.e. neighbors) display matching orientation,\nthen the surface is orientable. I.e., its global structure does not impose frustrations on the\nattempt to align all neighboring surface elements, or in other words, the attempt to orient\nthe surface. This can be verified for the surface shown in Fig. 2, and it is equally true for the\n(topologically equivalent) surface parametrized by eq. (1).\nIn terms of the associated vortex field strength, which will be constructed explicitly in\nthe next section, orienting the surface implies that the field strength behaves in a continuous\nmanner as one moves about the surface. By contrast, lines on the surface at which the\norientation flips would correspond to Dirac magnetic monopole singularities [10]. A nonorientable surface structure actually forces the presence of monopoles in the associated gauge\nfield; however, also orientable surfaces can carry monopoles (voluntarily, so to speak), if one\nchooses not to consistently orient the surface but instead allows for lines on the surface at\nwhich the orientation, i.e. the sign of the vortex field strength, flips.\nThe vortex surface parametrized by eq. (1) can also be arrived at directly in the continuum,\ncompletely independent of the above connection to a lattice surface. Namely, it results when\ncasting a perturbed instanton into the Laplacian Center Gauge, albeit with monopoles present\non the surface (which in fact is necessary in order to generate the unit topological charge of\nthe instanton). This is explained in more detail in Appendix B. In the treatment below, on\nthe other hand, no flips of orientation of the field strength will be present on the (orientable)\nvortex surface parametrized by eq. (1). The field strength will thus behave smoothly as one\nmoves about the surface. As a result of this simpler behavior of the gluonic color vector, the\nconfiguration will carry global topological charge zero. In fact, it is quite generally the case\nthat oriented vortex world-surfaces are associated with vanishing global topological charge\n[10]. One way of seeing this is to recast the global topological charge as an integral over\nthe boundary of the space-time manifold under consideration [14]. In [10], a construction\nof the vortex gauge field was given in which this gauge field has support on a three-volume\n7\n\n\fbounded by the vortex surface, and with no Dirac string singularities in the gauge field\nas long as the vortex surface is orientable. Thus, for orientable compact vortex surfaces\n(and correspondingly compact three-volumes spanning them), the gauge field vanishes at the\nboundary of space-time and there are no interior boundaries due to the absence of Dirac\nstrings; therefore, the global topological charge vanishes. By contrast, non-oriented vortex\nsurfaces force the presence of Dirac strings, thus providing the possibility of nonvanishing\ntopological charge via contributions from interior integration boundaries.\n\nIII.\n\nFIELD STRENGTH AND TOPOLOGICAL CHARGE\n\nChromomagnetic center vortices carry a field strength concentrated on the vortex, where\nthe nonvanishing field strength tensor component is the one associated with the two spacetime directions locally perpendicular to the vortex surface. Given a surface parametrization\ny(s) = y(s1 , s2 ) such as (1), a corresponding field strength can be constructed explicitly as\nF\u03bc\u03bd (x) =\n\n\u03c0\u03c3 3\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03ba\u03bb\n2\n\nZ\n\nd2 s \u03a3\u03ba\u03bb (s)f (x \u2212 y(s))\n\n(2)\n\nwith d2 s = ds1 ds2 and the (oriented) surface element\n\u03a3\u03ba\u03bb (s) \u2261 \u01ebab\n\n\u2202y\u03ba \u2202y\u03bb\n\u2202sa \u2202sb\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u01ebab represents the usual two-dimensional antisymmetric symbol with \u01eb12 = 1. Due to\nthe combination of the two tangent vectors to the surface, \u2202y/\u2202s1 and \u2202y/\u2202s2 in (3), with\nthe \u01eb-symbol in (2), the nonvanishing field strength tensor component is thus indeed the one\nassociated with the two space-time directions locally perpendicular to the vortex surface. For\ninstance, a surface locally running in the 1-2 directions carries \u03a312 and therefore F34 . On the\nother hand, \u03c3 3 denotes the third Pauli matrix, encoding the color structure of the vortex.\nNote thus that the field strength to be used here points into a constant direction in color\nspace, F a = F \u03b4 a3 , rendering the present problem essentially Abelian4 . Finally, the profile\nfunction f in (2) provides the freedom to vary the transverse structure of the vortex field\nstrength, since it controls the value of the field strength at finite distances |x \u2212 y(s)| from\n4\n\nIn particular, also the gauge field generating the vortex field strength (2) can be constructed to point into\nthe three-direction in color space [10].\n\n8\n\n\fthe surface parametrized by y(s). To preserve the total flux carried by the vortex when f is\nvaried, f must be normalized,\nZ\n\nd4 z f (z) = 1 .\n\n(4)\n\nTo be definite, below a (four-dimensional) Gaussian profile function\nf (z) =\n\n1\na4 \u03c0 2\n\ne\u2212z\n\n2 /a2\n\n(5)\n\nwill be used, with the variable a controlling the thickness of the vortex; in the limit a \u2192 0,\n(5) reduces to a four-dimensional delta function,\nlim f (z) = \u03b4 4 (z) .\n\n(6)\n\na\u21920\n\nThis corresponds to the limit of an infinitely thin vortex. For the moment, the vortices will\nin fact be taken to be infinitely thin, even though realistic, physically relevant vortices are\nnot infinitely thin, but thick in the sense that the field strength is smeared out to the vicinity\nof every point y(s). Further below, a thickening of the vortices will indeed play a crucial role\nin resolving the subtleties involved in evaluating the topological charge density arising from\nwrithe of a thin vortex world-surface.\nTwo more remarks about the field strength (2) are in order before proceeding. For one, a\nproper field strength must satisfy continuity of flux, i.e., the Bianchi identity,\n\u01eb\u03c1\u03c4 \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03c4 F\u03bc\u03bd = 0\n\n(7)\n\nwhere it has already been used that the problem is essentially an Abelian one. The field\nstrength (2) satisfies (7), for any profile function f , as sketched in Appendix C. Secondly,\nthe normalization of (2) has been adequately chosen such that the vortex indeed carries flux\ncorresponding to the center of the SU(2) gauge group [10], i.e., a Wilson loop circumscribing\nthe vortex yields the phase \u22121. This is demonstrated in Appendix D.\nThe topological charge Q and the corresponding topological charge density q(x) are defined\nas\nQ=\n\n1\n32\u03c0 2\n\nZ\n\nd4 x \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03ba\u03bb Tr F\u03bc\u03bd F\u03ba\u03bb \u2261\n\nZ\n\nd4 x q(x) .\n\n(8)\n\nIn view of this expression, topological charge density is generated at those points in space-time\nwhere there are nonvanishing field strength tensor components F\u03bc\u03bd , F\u03ba\u03bb such that the indices\n{\u03bc, \u03bd, \u03ba, \u03bb} span all four space-time directions. Translating this (naively) into the properties\n9\n\n\fof (thin) vortex surfaces, in view of the discussion so far, the same must hold for the surface\nelements \u03a3\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a3\u03ba\u03bb of the vortex. In other words (in analogy to the two-dimensional toy model\nof the introduction), topological charge is ostensibly generated at those points in space-time\nwhere the set of tangent vectors to a thin vortex surface configuration spans all space-time\ndirections [3].\nThis way of stating the characteristics of a vortex surface necessary for generating topological charge is quite adequate in some circumstances. For example, as will be seen in the example discussed below, for lattice surfaces it is entirely sufficient, and technically convenient,\nto consider idealized, infinitely thin surfaces for the purpose of evaluating the topological\ncharge5 , and to look for the points where the set of tangent vectors spans all four space-time\ndirections. Furthermore, even when considering general continuum vortex surfaces, intersection points are adequately described by this characterization. For instance, a surface locally\nrunning into the 1-2 directions carries F34 ; a surface locally running into the 3-4 directions\ncarries F12 . If the two happen to intersect at a point, the product F12 F34 is nonvanishing\nand topological charge is generated. Such intersection points will be present for lattice surfaces as well as thin and thick vortices in the continuum (where the surfaces need not cross\nperpendicularly). They always contribute \u00b11/2 to the topological charge (even when the\ncrossing is not perpendicular [10]), where the sign just depends on the relative orientation of\nthe surfaces.\nOn the other hand, one must not be too naive in applying the above characterization, in the\ncase of general continuum surfaces, to other contributions to the topological charge, which will\nbe subsumed under the term writhing contributions6 . The corresponding topological charge\ndensity is rather hidden in the singular nature of the field strength associated with a thin\ncontinuum vortex surface, as will be discussed in detail further below. As a result, it is easily\nmissed if one naively just looks for those points in the surface configuration where the set\nof tangent vectors spans all four space-time directions. It is the main objective of this work\nto elucidate the writhing contributions using the example surfaces which were introduced in\n5\n\n6\n\nNote also that the global topological charge can be recast as an integral over the boundary of the space-time\nmanifold under consideration [14]; therefore, it should be independent of any specific assumptions about\nthe vortex transverse profile, which, after all, merely corresponds to a local deformation of the gauge field\nin the vicinity of the vortex.\nWrithe is a property of loops in three dimensions which enters the topological charge in a 3+1 dimensional\npicture [10].\n\n10\n\n\fFIG. 6: Detailed view of the intersection point in Fig. 2.\n\nsection II.\n\nA.\n\nLattice surface\n\nAs already mentioned above, finding the set of points where the tangent vectors to the surface\nconfiguration span all four space-time directions is sufficient to capture all contributions to\nthe topological charge in the case of lattice surfaces made up of elementary squares. In\nthis case, the topological charge density is concentrated at lattice sites; each instance of two\nsquares sharing a lattice site and their combined tangent vectors spanning all four space-time\ndirections contributes a \"quantum\" \u00b11/32 to the topological charge [3]. As before, the sign\ndepends on the relative orientation of the squares.\nConsidering the lattice configuration of Fig. 2, one notices a self-intersection point at the\ncenter of the configuration with Q = 1/2. This contribution results from four elementary\nsquares connected to the intersection point extending into the 1-2 directions and four elementary squares connected to the intersection point extending into the 3-4 directions, cf. the\ndetailed view displayed in Fig. 6. This indeed amounts to 16 pairs of perpendicular squares,\ni.e., Q = 16/32 = 1/2.\nThe complete set of topological charge contributions associated with the surface depicted\nin Fig. 2 is shown in Fig. 7. Thus, apart from the intersection point at the center of the\nconfiguration, there are four writhing contributions concentrated at other lattice sites. At\nthose sites, the vortex surface bends in such a way that it generates the perpendicular squares\nneeded for a topological charge contribution within one single branch of the surface. A\ncloser look reveals that there are four pairs of perpendicular squares at each such point,\n11\n\n\fQ=1/2\nQ=-1/8\nQ=-1/8\n\nt=1\n\nQ=-1/8\nt=0\n\nQ=-1/8\nr3\n\nt=-1\nr1\nr2\n\nFIG. 7: Topological charge contributions from vortex self-intersection and writhe present in the\nworld-surface depicted in Fig. 2. To fully determine the signs of the contributions, the relative\norientations of the elementary squares making up the surface must be fixed; this was done (starting\nfrom an initial square of arbitrary orientation) in such a way as to completely orient the surface,\ni.e., there are no edges shared by two squares at which the orientation flips.\n\ni.e., topological charge contributions Q = 4 \u00d7 (\u22121/32) = \u22121/8. Together, these writhing\ncontributions exactly cancel the one from the intersection point, such that Qglobal = 1/2 \u2212\n4/8 = 0. This is in agreement with the general statement that oriented vortex world-surfaces\nare associated with vanishing global topological charge [10].\nNote thus that, on the lattice, writhe is concentrated at points on the vortex surface. For\nsmooth continuum surfaces, the topological charge density associated with writhe will be\nspread out smoothly on the surfaces corresponding to the more gradual way in which they\ntwist; this will become clear in the subsequent sections.\n\nB.\n\nContinuum surface\n\nHaving discussed the topological charge of the coarse-grained lattice surface displayed in\nFig. 2, one may ask how this treatment translates to the continuum analogue parametrized\n12\n\n\fby eq. (1). If one again starts from the statement that topological charge is generated where\nthe tangent vectors to the surface span all four space-time directions, the contribution from\nthe intersection point is as evident as before. However, one may be (mis-) led to conclude that\nthere are no further contributions; after all, in the case of a smooth continuum surface, away\nfrom self-intersection points, there is always a well-defined unique two-dimensional tangent\nplane at each point. Nowhere do the tangent vectors span all four space-time directions.\nWhere is the contribution from vortex writhe7 ?\nClearly, it would be too naive to declare it absent; for one, the smooth configuration shown\nin Fig. 5 is topologically equivalent to the lattice version depicted in Fig. 2. Also on general\ngrounds, an orientable surface such as the one of Fig. 5 must have global topological charge\nzero [10]; therefore, there must be writhing contributions canceling the contribution from the\nself-intersection point which is certainly there. The point is that the writhing contributions\nare rather hidden in the singular structure of the field strength corresponding to an infinitely\nthin vortex surface, which has been implicitly assumed in the above discussion.\nTo properly extract the writhing contributions, one must view the infinitely thin vortex\nsurfaces as an idealized limiting case of general thick vortices (in fact, physically relevant\nvortices have a finite thickness). When the vortex field strength is smeared out transversally,\nthere will of course in general be a certain overlap between field strengths originating from\nthe smearing of neighboring points on the original thin surface. This leads to a nonvanishing\ntopological density \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03ba\u03bb F\u03bc\u03bd F\u03ba\u03bb even if the underlying thin surface is smooth, as long as it\ncurves suitably, i.e. writhes, in the space-time region under consideration. If one now makes\nthe vortices thinner, then the overlap regions shrink, but at the same time, the modulus of\nthe field strength increases such that in the thin limit, a finite topological density remains on\nthe thin vortex surface. This in fact must happen such that the global topological charge is\nentirely independent of the vortex thickness, including the infinitely thin limit \u2013 after all, a\ntopological quantity should be independent of local deformations such as a thickening of the\nvortex. The main purpose of the present treatment lies in demonstrating all this explicitly\nusing the specific example vortex world-surface introduced in eq. (1). First, thick vortices\nwill be treated, in which the width of the profile functions a, cf. eq. (5), can still be varied.\n7\n\nThe authors acknowledge R. Bertle for insisting this question be answered, thus sparking the present\ninvestigation.\n\n13\n\n\fThen, the thin limit a \u2192 0 will be considered.\n1.\n\nThick vortex\n\nInserting the field strength (2) into the topological charge density (8), one obtains\n1 Z 2 Z 2 \u2032\nq(x) =\nd s d s \u01eb\u03c1\u03c4 \u03b2\u03b3 \u03a3\u03c1\u03c4 (s)\u03a3\u03b2\u03b3 (s\u2032 )f (x \u2212 y(s))f (x \u2212 y(s\u2032))\n16\n\n(9)\n\nafter having taken the color trace, Tr (\u03c3 3 \u03c3 3 ) = 2, and having simplified the Lorentz structure\nwith the help of\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03ba\u03bb \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c4 \u01eb\u03ba\u03bb\u03b2\u03b3 = 2(\u03b4\u03ba\u03c1 \u03b4\u03bb\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b4\u03ba\u03c4 \u03b4\u03bb\u03c1 )\u01eb\u03ba\u03bb\u03b2\u03b3 = 4\u01eb\u03c1\u03c4 \u03b2\u03b3 .\n\n(10)\n\nAppendix E contains the tedious, but straightforward, algebra involved in inserting the specific parametrization (1) into the surface elements and subsequently reducing (9) to\nq(x) =\n\n1\nd2 s d2 s\u2032 f (x \u2212 y(s))f (x \u2212 y(s\u2032)) *\n4\nh\ni\nsin 2s2 sin 2s\u20322 sin2 (s1 \u2212 s\u20321 ) \u2212 sin 3(s2 \u2212 s\u20322 ) sin(s2 \u2212 s\u20322 ) .\nZ\n\nZ\n\n(11)\n\nTo proceed from this simple form for the topological density, explicit profile functions f must\nbe inserted.

Therefore, by substituting p = s1 \u2212 s\u20321\n\nand q = s1 + s\u20321 , with the Jacobian dp dq = 2ds1 ds\u20321 , one can carry out one of the integrations\n\nvia the general identity\nZ\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\nds1\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n0\n\nds\u20321\n\ng(s1 \u2212\n\ns\u20321 )\n\n1\n=\n2\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\n\u22122\u03c0\n\ndp g(p)\n\nZ\n\n4\u03c0\u2212|p|\n\n|p|\n\ndq = 2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\ndp g(p)(2\u03c0 \u2212 p)\n\n(13)\n\nwhere in the last equality, the p-integration interval has been halved using the fact that in\nthe case considered here, g(p) \u2261 g(|p|).

Therefore, the integral must include writhing contributions\nwhich serve to cancel the contribution of the self-intersection point at the center of the surface\nconfiguration.\nIn order to exhibit the writhe in more detail, it is useful to evaluate the topological charge\ndensity q(x) numerically for a thick vortex profile and visualize the result. For this purpose,\nit is useful to rewrite eq. (11). Working with (11), one would need to evaluate a fourdimensional integral for each space-time point x; however, the task can be greatly simplified\nby decomposing the square brackets in (11) using\n1\n(1 \u2212 cos 2s1 cos 2s\u20321 \u2212 sin 2s1 sin 2s\u20321 )\n(15)\n2\nsin 3(s2 \u2212 s\u20322 ) sin(s2 \u2212 s\u20322 ) = (sin 3s2 cos 3s\u20322 \u2212 cos 3s2 sin 3s\u20322 ) (sin s2 cos s\u20322 \u2212 cos s2 sin s\u20322 ) .\nsin2 (s1 \u2212 s\u20321 ) =\n\nBy multiplying out all the terms which thus result in the square brackets and letting the\nintegrations act on them separately, the topological charge density reduces to a sum over\nterms in which the four-dimensional integrals factorize into pairs of two-dimensional integrals\nover the unprimed and the primed variables, respectively.\nUsing this numerically convenient form, the topological charge density was evaluated for\na grid of points in space at selected times t \u2261 x1 , where, to be definite, the value a = 1/5\nwas used in the profile functions f , cf. (5). In order to visualize the result, all points in space\nwere plotted at which the modulus of the topological charge density exceeds a certain value,\nnamely |q(x)| > 1, for each time t. The results are displayed in Figs. 8-10.\nAt the times t = \u22120.3, 0, 0.3, one finds a round lump of topological charge density q(x) > 1\nnear the center of the configuration; this is the contribution from the smeared-out intersection\npoint. Furthermore, there are peripheral kidney-shaped lumps with q(x) < \u22121. Also the\nlumps seen at t = \u22120.9, \u22120.6, 0.6, 0.9 are associated with q(x) < \u22121. These are all the\ntopological charge contributions induced by vortex writhe; they are evidently spread out\nsmoothly over much of the vortex world-surface (and its surroundings), corresponding to\n15\n\n\fFIG. 8: Time slices of the topological charge density induced by the vortex field strength (2) with\nthe vortex world-surface parametrization (1) and a vortex thickness of a = 1/5, cf. (5). At the\ntimes t = \u22120.9 (left) and t = \u22120.6 (right), all points in space are plotted at which the modulus of\nthe topological charge density |q(x)| exceeds unity. At the two times displayed, these are actually\nall points with q(x) < \u22121; in the companion figure Fig. 9 below, depicting further time slices, also\npoints with q(x) > 1 will be seen. To guide the eye, also the corresponding time slices of the thin\nvortex world-surface parametrization are plotted, identical to the plots in Fig. 5 at the corresponding\ntimes. Thus, the viewing angle of the observer matches the one adopted in Fig. 5.\n\nFIG. 9: As Fig. 8, at the times t = \u22120.3 (left), t = 0 (center) and t = 0.3 (right). At these times,\nboth points with q(x) > 1 (at the center of the configuration, induced by the vortex self-intersection),\nand points with q(x) < \u22121 (kidney-shaped lumps at the periphery of the configuration, induced by\nvortex writhe) are present.\n\nthe smooth, gradual way in which the surface writhes. Careful evaluation of the topological\ncharge density using thickened vortices thus allows one to recover all contributions to the\ntopological charge, consistent with the lattice analysis and general arguments. Smoothness\nof a vortex surface does not preclude writhing contributions, as may have been thought from\nnaively considering infinitely thin surfaces from the start, cf. the discussion at the beginning\nof section III B. Below, it will be shown that the writhing contributions persist for infinitely\n16\n\n\fFIG. 10: As Fig. 8, at the times t = 0.6 (left) and t = 0.9 (right).\n\nthin vortex surfaces, by explicitly taking the limit of a vanishing thickness, a \u2192 0.\n2.\n\nThin vortex\n\nInspecting the expressions (9) or (11) for the topological charge density, taking the thin\nvortex limit implies that contributions to q(x) can only come from points in the s, s\u2032 -integrals\nwhere y(s) = y(s\u2032 ), since the profile functions become \u03b4-distributions in this limit. In the\ncase of the surface parametrization (1), the condition y(s) = y(s\u2032) can be realized in two\nways; either s = s\u2032 , corresponding to writhing contributions, or (s2 , s\u20322 ) \u2208 {(0, \u03c0/2), (\u03c0/2, 0)}\n\ncorresponding to the intersection point at y = 0 (note that s2 = s\u20322 \u2208 {0, \u03c0/2} is already\nincluded in the former case). Thus, in the space of parameters s, s\u2032 , the self-intersection\n\ncontribution is conveniently isolated from the writhe, s = s\u2032 , and the corresponding regions\nin the integral over s, s\u2032 can be treated separately.\nConsider first the self-intersection point.

Note that, in the case of the\nintersection point, it was possible to work with thin vortices from the start and the application\nof the formalism was straightforward, yielding the correct result. In the case of the writhing\ncontributions, on the other hand, this is not the case; the formalism becomes ambiguous if\none naively uses thin vortices. To see this, consider again eq. (16). In the case s = s\u2032 , the\nterm in the square brackets vanishes, corresponding to the fact that the tangent space at any\n18\n\n\fpoint of a smooth surface is two-dimensional8 (away from self-intersection points). On the\nother hand, when s = s\u2032 , the argument of the second \u03b4-function, \u03b4 4 (y(s) \u2212 y(s\u2032 )), vanishes on\na whole two-dimensional sub-manifold of space-time. Two out of the four dimensions in this\n\u03b4-function suffice to enforce s = s\u2032 , while the remaining two stay as \u03b4 2 (0). This is precisely\nthe situation discussed in the initial remarks of section III B; the product of these two factors\nis ambiguous, and one has to work to higher order in the thickness of the vortex in order\nto obtain a well-defined limit and thus properly extract the writhing contributions. Starting\nagain from (11), one can write, in the limit a \u2192 0,\nq(x) =\n\n1\nZ4\n\nZ\n\nd2 s \u03b4 4 (x \u2212 y(s)) *\n\n(21)\n\nh\n\ni\n\nd2 s\u2032 f (y(s) \u2212 y(s\u2032)) sin 2s2 sin 2s\u20322 sin2 (s1 \u2212 s\u20321 ) \u2212 sin 3(s2 \u2212 s\u20322 ) sin(s2 \u2212 s\u20322 ) .\n\nNote thus that f (x \u2212 y(s)) in (11) has already been substituted by its thin limit, \u03b4 4 (x \u2212 y(s));\nthis will be justified a posteriori by the second line in (21) yielding a well-defined result.\nCorrespondingly, in the remaining profile function f in (21), x has again been substituted\nby y(s) due to the presence of \u03b4 4 (x \u2212 y(s)). Now, since the writhing contributions originate\nfrom the region around s = s\u2032 , it is useful to substitute\ns\u2032a = sa + ra\n\n(22)\n\nand to expand in the small quantities ra ; the profile function f will restrict the new ra integrations to small ra when the vortex thickness a becomes small. To second order in the\nra , the square bracket in (21) reads\nsin 2s2 sin 2(s2 + r2 ) sin2 r1 \u2212 sin 3r2 sin r2 = r12 sin2 2s2 \u2212 3r22 + O(r 3 ) .\n\n(23)\n\nFurthermore, the profile function f depends on (y(s) \u2212 y(s\u2032))2 , which to this order reads\n\u2032\n\n2\n\n(y(s) \u2212 y(s )) =\n\n\u2202y(s)\nra\n\u2202sa\n\n!2\n\n+ O(r 3 ) = r12 sin 2s2 +\n\nr22\n+ O(r 3)\nsin 2s2\n\n(24)\n\nas can be verified straightforwardly by computing the scalar products of the gradient vectors\n\u2202y(s)/\u2202sa , cf. eqs. (E3),(E4). As a consequence, the topological charge density reduces to\n1\nq(x) =\n4\n\nZ\n\nd2 s \u03b4 4 (x \u2212 y(s)) *\n\n1\na4 \u03c0 2\n8\n\nZ\n\ndr1 dr2 exp \u2212\n\n(25)\n1\nr22\n2\nr\nsin\n2s\n+\n2\na2 1\nsin 2s2\n\n!!\n\n\u0010\n\nr12 sin2 2s2 \u2212 3r22\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\nNote that, also in the general expression (9), the combination \u01eb\u03c1\u03c4 \u03b2\u03b3 \u03a3\u03c1\u03c4 (s)\u03a3\u03b2\u03b3 (s\u2032 ) is easily seen to vanish\nwhen s = s\u2032 .\n\n19\n\n\fIn the limit a \u2192 0, the Gaussian strongly suppresses the integrand for increasing r1 , r2 , so\nthat the integration ranges of r1 , r2 can be extended over the whole real axis without incurring\nan error (except possibly for the boundary values s2 = 0 and s2 = \u03c0/2, at which the integral\nwill be defined by continuity and will presently be seen to vanish). Furthermore, the higher\norder terms in the ra which have been neglected above only lead to corrections which vanish\nas a \u2192 0. Evaluating the Gaussian integrals in (25), one arrives at\nqwrithe (x) =\n\nZ\n\n\u0012\n\nd2 s \u03b4 4 (x \u2212 y(s)) \u2212\n\n1\nsin 2s2\n4\u03c0\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(26)\n\nThus, the topological charge density originating from vortex writhe persists in the thin limit;\nit is concentrated on the vortex surface and, in view of (y(s))2 = sin 2s2 , grows as the square\nof the distance from the origin, consistent with the visualization for thick vortices exhibited in\nFigs. 8-10. The authors checked that the same result is obtained using a (properly normalized)\nLorentzian for the profile function f .

The space-time integral over this expression is\nknown as a representation of (minus) the self-intersection number, which is thus given in\nterms of an integral over a smooth density [16]. In the context of the present work, this\nidentification corresponds to the observation that the \"smooth\" writhing contribution to the\ntopological charge cancels the \"discrete\" one from the self-intersection point. The validity of\n(31) has been corroborated in the present paper by considering the thick vortex explicitly.\nThere exists another intuitive formula for the self-intersection number in terms of normal\ngauge fields [17, 18], which is related to the fact that \u03a3\u0303 is normal to the vortex surface: Take\ntwo orthonormal normal vectors n1 and n2 , and define an SO(2) gauge field A = n1\u03bc dn2\u03bc and\nits field strength F = dA. Then the self-intersection number is given by\n\nR\n\nF/4\u03c0.\n\nAs is best seen from the appearance of h \u223c \u2202\u03a3\u2202 \u03a3\u0303 in the equations above, the writhe\nis distributed according to the gradients of the tangent space and of the normal space, respectively. The vortex example discussed in this work is planar at the self-intersection point\nsuch that the writhing contribution vanishes there, but this will not be the case for arbitrary\nvortex surfaces.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nUsing a specific simple example, it has been shown in this work how topological charge\narises through vortex writhe in the space-time continuum. The topological charge density\n21\n\n\fwas visualized for a thickened vortex and it was verified that the global topological charge is\nindependent of the vortex thickness. Topological charge through writhe persists in the limit\nof arbitrarily thin vortex world-surfaces, even though it is rather hidden in the singular nature\nof the vortex field strength in this limit. Smoothness of a vortex surface does not preclude\nthese writhing contributions, which were demonstrated to be proportional to a particular\ncombination of gradients of the surface elements10 , i.e., of the tangent space.\nIn the example discussed here, the appearance of writhe and the existence of the selfintersection point are intertwined; a closed vortex surface not extending to infinity has to\nbend and \"come back\" in order to display a lone self-intersection point. This need not be the\ncase when space-time possesses compact directions; the vortex surface can then be closed due\nto periodicity. Therefore, on the four-torus, one can have a (thin) vortex consisting of two\nbranches x1 = x2 = 0 and x3 = x4 = 0 which intersect at a point but otherwise are completely\nplanar. Then the contributions to the topological charge are Qint = 1/2 and Qwrithe = 0. This\ndoes not contradict general statements on the quantization of topological charge; half-integer\ntopological charges exist on the torus when accompanied by twisted boundary conditions11 .\nOn the four-torus a single self-intersection point can thus occur without writhe. Conversely,\nwrithe can obviously exist without a self-intersection point, a simple example being the time\nevolution of Fig. 5 from t = \u22120.9 to t = 0\u2212 followed by the time reversed process (i.e., the loop\nis unscrewed back in the direction it came from instead of being twisted further as in Fig. 5).\nGlobally, this leads to Qwrithe = 0. An example of a (non-orientable) surface with writhing\ncontribution Qwrithe = 1/2 and no intersection point is depicted in [4]. A smooth continuum\nanalogue of this surface (as well as the precise relation to twisted boundary conditions) has\nnot been given so far.\nTwo additional points became apparent in the course of this investigation which deserve\nmention. For one, comparing sections III A and III B, it is considerably simpler to evaluate\nthe topological charge of a surface made up of elementary squares on a hypercubic lattice than\nto evaluate it for a general continuum surface, in which writhe is rather hidden, as already\n10\n\n11\n\nNote that the mere existence of such gradients does not suffice; for instance, the 2-sphere embedded in R4\npossesses gradients of the surface elements, but the writhe vanishes.\nIndeed, the gauge fields corresponding to this configuration, A1 = \u03c0\u0398(x2 )\u03b4(x1 )\u03c3 3 , A3 = \u03c0\u0398(x4 )\u03b4(x3 )\u03c3 3 ,\nA2 = A4 = 0 obey transition functions similar to the charge 1/2 instanton solutions of constant field\nstrength [19, 20].\n\n22\n\n\fremarked further above. On the lattice, topological charge is concentrated at lattice sites\nas opposed to being smeared out over the surface; as a consequence, it is simply accessible\nby counting pairs of mutually orthogonal elementary squares meeting at the lattice sites,\ncf. also [3]. A viable and efficient procedure of determining the global topological charge of\na general continuum surface indeed would lie in latticizing it, i.e. finding a topologically\nequivalent lattice surface on a suitably fine lattice, and evaluating its global topological\ncharge instead12 . Note that this stands in marked contrast to the usual statement made for\nlattice Yang-Mills configurations; on the standard Yang-Mills lattice, carrying Yang-Mills link\nvariables, topological charge is much harder to define and detect than in the continuum, and\nindeed becomes an ambiguous quantity for generic Yang-Mills configurations. By contrast,\non a lattice carrying vortex fluxes such as used here, which is dual to the standard Yang-Mills\nlattice, topological charge actually is easier to evaluate than in the continuum.\nFinally, note that a standard way of capturing the topology of lines in three-dimensional\nspace lies in defining a framing. One constructs a second line displaced from the original\none by a small distance; the two lines define the edges of a ribbon which may twist and\nwrithe, with the two lines correspondingly entangled. With the help of such a framing, one\ncan define a (three-dimensional) writhing number; the topological charge associated with the\nwhole world-surface of a vortex line can then be related to the difference between the writhing\nnumbers at the initial and final times bounding the space-time region under consideration\n[10]. The procedure of defining a framing fits into the formalism used in the present work;\nit corresponds to one particular way of choosing the profile function f . Namely, the original\nthin vortex line at a given time, described by a \u03b4-function profile, is \"smeared\" into two thin\nlines, i.e. two \u03b4-functions displaced from one another by a small distance. For the purposes\nof the present investigation, it was however more appropriate to choose a smoother profile\nfunction, leading to a finite gluonic field strength; not only from a technical point of view,\nbut also from a physics point of view, this is a natural choice, since realistic physical vortices\nindeed possess thick, spread-out transverse profiles.\n12\n\nNote however that, as far as the local topological density is concerned, the (absolute values of) local\ncontributions to the topological charge on rectangular lattices are bounded from below by the \"quantum\"\n1/16 (not 1/32, because at the sites of a closed lattice surface, there cannot be a single pair of mutually\nperpendicular elementary squares). Therefore, to approximate continuum writhing contributions to the\ntopological density to any precision, one has to use non-rectangular polygonal surfaces, in the simplest case\njust a triangulation of the continuum surface.\n\n23\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nM.E. acknowledges the hospitality of P. van Baal and the Instituut-Lorentz at Leiden\nUniversity, where this work was initiated.

In the particular cases of the Laplacian Abelian Gauge [22] and\nthe Laplacian Center Gauge [7], monopoles and vortices are defined, respectively, to be the\nnodes of the ground state of the covariant Laplacian \u2212D2 [A] (in the adjoint representation)\nand the set of points where the two lowest-lying eigenvectors of this operator are parallel.\nThe ground state \u03c6 of \u2212D2 [A] in the background of a single instanton (in regular gauge) has\nbeen found [23] to be threefold degenerate and of the form (12 denoting the 2 \u00d7 2 unit matrix)\n\u03c6a = r 2 g \u2020 \u03c3a g,\n\ng = (x4 12 + ixa \u03c3a )/r\n\n(B1)\n\nnear the four-dimensional origin. There, both the monopole and the vortex are located,\ndegenerate to a pointlike defect.\nIn [24], it was shown that perturbing the instanton background A such that the ground\nstate is perturbed as \u03c63 \u2192 \u03c63 \u2212 R2 \u03c33 gives rise to a monopole loop of radius R in the\nx1 x2 -plane.\n\n25\n\n\fFor the center vortex, one considers in the same spirit the perturbation\n\u03c6pert\n= \u03c61 + \u03c33 ,\n1\n\n\u03c6pert\n= \u03c63\n3\n\n(B2)\n\nwhere the relevant scale has been put to 1. Straightforward algebra shows that \u03c6pert\nand \u03c6pert\n1\n3\nare parallel at\n\u03c612 \u2212 \u03c634 = \u03c0 mod 2\u03c0,\n\nr=\n\n\u221a\n\nsin 2\u03b8\n\n(B3)\n\nwhere double polar coordinates have been introduced,\nx\u03bc = r(cos \u03b8 cos \u03c612 , cos \u03b8 sin \u03c612 , sin \u03b8 cos \u03c634 , sin \u03b8 sin \u03c634 ) .\n\n(B4)\n\nThis leaves\ns2 \u2261 \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2],\n\ns1 \u2261 (\u03c612 + \u03c634 )/2 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0]\n\n(B5)\n\nas free parameters. Up to rotations and inversions in space-time, this corresponds to the\nvortex surface parametrization of eq. (1); namely, one must permute the 1-, 3- and 4components as (1, 3, 4) \u2192 (4, 1, 3), and then rotate the resulting 1- and 2-components as\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(x1 , x2 ) \u2192 ((x1 \u2212 x2 )/ 2, (\u2212x1 \u2212 x2 )/ 2). Note that, without the latter rotation, the\nparametrization would have a more symmetric form; however, for the purposes of visualization, the choice of coordinates (1) is more advantageous. This simply amounts to a change\nin the point of view of the observer, not an actual change in the form of the vortex surface.\nThe monopole defined by \u03c6pert\nhas to fulfil (B3) plus the condition \u03b8 = \u03c0/4, i.e. it is a\n1\nloop on the vortex which is as far away as possible from the origin. The monopole of \u03c6pert\n3\nis still degenerate to the origin (but adding a perturbation to it lifts also this degeneracy\nwhile leading to similar vortex surfaces). For the present purposes, the detailed form of the\nmonopole loops is not relevant; the monopole content of the configuration resulting from the\nabove construction is not adopted in the body of this work. Only the surface (1), which in\nitself is orientable and thus is not forced to carry monopoles, is used, and endowed with an\noriented, smooth field strength.\n\n26\n\n\fAPPENDIX C: BIANCHI IDENTITY\n\nThe field strength (2) satisfies the Abelian Bianchi identity (7) independent of the profile\nfunction f .

Now, one can partially integrate the\nfirst term over s2 and the second term over s1 without generating surface contributions, upon\nwhich the two terms are seen to cancel, as was to be shown. When partially integrating over\ns1 , there is no surface contribution because y(0, s2) = y(2\u03c0, s2) for any s2 . When partially\nintegrating over s2 , both y(s1 , 0) = 0 and y(s1 , \u03c0/2) = 0; therefore, also \u2202y\u03c1 /\u2202s1 = 0 for\ns2 = 0, \u03c0/2, i.e. the surface contribution already vanishes separately for these two values of\ns2 .\nNote that this argument does not particularly depend on the specifics of the vortex surface\nconsidered here. Quite generally, since vortex world-surfaces are closed, they can be viewed\nas \"time\" evolutions of closed loops. Therefore, one can choose13 \"time\" as one parameter\nof the vortex surface, and an angle parametrizing the closed loop at a given \"time\" as the\nother. As a result, partial integration over the aforementioned angle never generates a surface\ncontribution, since the two end points of the interval on which the angle is defined map to\nidentical space-time points for any given \"time\". On the other hand, at the initial and final\n\"times\", the surface parametrization reduces to a point; otherwise, the surface would not be\nclosed. In other words, at these two \"times\", the surface parametrization is a constant spacetime point independent of the angle variable. As a result, the derivative of the parametrization\n13\n\nThis \"time\" does not have to correspond to physical time; also in the case of the parametrization (1), the\nparameter s2 is not identical to physical time.\n\n27\n\n\fwith respect to the angle, which appears in the surface pieces under consideration (cf. the\nfirst term in (C3)), vanishes.\n\nAPPENDIX D: CENTER PHASE INDUCED BY VORTEX FLUX\n\nTo see that the normalization of (2) is adequately chosen such that vortices indeed carry flux\ncorresponding to the center of the SU(2) gauge group, consider for the sake of the argument\na planar vortex world-surface extending into the 1-2-directions in space-time,\n\u0233(s1 , s2 ) = (s1 , s2 , 0, 0) ,\n\ns1 , s2 \u2208 [\u2212\u221e, \u221e] .\n\n(D1)\n\nAny smooth vortex surface can be viewed as being locally planar, i.e. of the form (D1) on\nsufficiently small length scales (if the space-time axes are chosen suitably). Inserting (D1)\ninto (2), one obtains the field strength\nF34 (x) = \u03c0\u03c3\n\n3\n\nZ\n\nd2 s f (x \u2212 \u0233(s1 , s2 )) =\n\n\u03c3 3 \u2212(x23 +x24 )/a2\ne\na2\n\n(D2)\n\nwhere the explicit form (5) has been inserted. Now, consider a Wilson loop C located in the\n3-4-plane circumscribing the vortex (e.g. a circle centered at the origin with sufficiently large\nradius R to capture the entire vortex flux, which may be smeared out via the profile function\nf ; i.e., R2 /a2 \u226b 1),\nI\nZ\n1\n1\n1\n3\nW [C] = Tr exp i dx\u03bc A\u03bc = Tr exp i dx3 dx4 F34 = Tr ei\u03c0\u03c3 = \u22121 .\n2\n2\n2\nC\nS\n\u0012\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\n(D3)\n\nHere, for the second equality, Stokes' theorem has been used (in a fixed time slice, x1 = 0),\ni.e. S represents the area in the 3-4-plane bounded by C. For the third equality, the condition\nR2 /a2 \u226b 1 has been used, which permits extending the integral over S to the entire 3-4-plane\nwithout appreciably changing the result. Note also that no path ordering is necessary in the\nWilson loop due to the Abelian nature of the problem. Thus, one indeed has W [C] = \u22121,\ni.e. the total flux carried by the vortex corresponds to the nontrivial center element of the\nSU(2) gauge group. Continuity of flux, i.e. the Bianchi identity (7), guarantees that this\nresult extends to the entirety of any vortex world-surface given that it is true locally for a\nsmall vortex segment, as shown explicitly here.\n\n28\n\n\fAPPENDIX E: SIMPLIFYING THE TOPOLOGICAL CHARGE DENSITY\n\nThe topological charge density (9),\n1\nq(x) =\n16\n\nZ\n\n2\n\nds\n\nZ\n\nd2 s\u2032 \u01eb\u03c1\u03c4 \u03b2\u03b3 \u03a3\u03c1\u03c4 (s)\u03a3\u03b2\u03b3 (s\u2032 )f (x \u2212 y(s))f (x \u2212 y(s\u2032))\n\nwhere, cf.

Multiplying out the resulting\nterms in the square brackets in (E11), one finds\n1\nq(x) =\nd2 s d2 s\u2032 f (x \u2212 y(s))f (x \u2212 y(s\u2032 )) *\n8\n[\u2212 sin 2s2 sin 2s\u20322 sin 2s1 sin 2s\u20321\nZ\n\nZ\n\n(E14)\n\n+1 \u2212 (cos 2s2 \u2212 cos 2s\u20322 ) \u2212 cos 2s2 cos 2s\u20322 \u2212 2 cos2 2s2 \u2212 2 cos2 2s\u20322\n\u2212 2 cos 2s2 cos 2s\u20322 (cos 2s2 \u2212 cos 2s\u20322 ) + 4 cos2 2s2 cos2 2s\u20322\n\u2212 sin 2s2 sin 2s\u20322 cos 2s1 cos 2s\u20321 \u2212 2 sin 2s2 sin 2s\u20322 (cos 2s2 cos 2s\u20321 \u2212 cos 2s1 cos 2s\u20322 )\n+ 4 sin 2s2 sin 2s\u20322 cos 2s2 cos 2s\u20322 ]\nwhere a factor four has been extracted from the square brackets. Now, all the terms inside\nthe square brackets which are grouped into pairs by parentheses are seen to cancel if one uses\nthe freedom to exchange the names of the dummy integration variables s, s\u2032 on one of the\nmembers of each pair. Furthermore, by using\ncos 2s1 cos 2s\u20321 + sin 2s1 sin 2s\u20321 = cos 2(s1 \u2212 s\u20321 ) = 1 \u2212 2 sin2 (s1 \u2212 s\u20321 )\n\n(E15)\n\nto combine the first terms of the first and the fourth lines in the square brackets in (E14), and\nsupplementing this with the contribution \u2212 cos 2s2 cos 2s\u20322 from the second line, one obtains\nq(x) =\n\n1\nd2 s d2 s\u2032 f (x \u2212 y(s))f (x \u2212 y(s\u2032 )) *\n8\nh\n2 sin 2s2 sin 2s\u20322 sin2 (s1 \u2212 s\u20321 ) \u2212 cos 2(s2 \u2212 s\u20322 ) + sin 4s2 sin 4s\u20322\nZ\n\nZ\n\n+(1 \u2212 2 cos2 2s2 ) (1 \u2212 2 cos2 2s\u20322 )\n\n(E16)\n\ni\n\nafter having combined the remaining terms in the second and third lines in the square brackets\nin (E14) into the product in the last line of (E16). Again using (E12), this time with z =\n2s2 , 2s\u20322 , one finally arrives at the result aimed for, eq. (11),\n1\nd2 s d2 s\u2032 f (x \u2212 y(s))f (x \u2212 y(s\u2032)) *\nq(x) =\nh4\ni\nsin 2s2 sin 2s\u20322 sin2 (s1 \u2212 s\u20321 ) \u2212 sin 3(s2 \u2212 s\u20322 ) sin(s2 \u2212 s\u20322 )\nZ\n\nZ\n\nafter having used\ncos 4(s2 \u2212 s\u20322 ) \u2212 cos 2(s2 \u2212 s\u20322 ) = \u22122 sin 3(s2 \u2212 s\u20322 ) sin(s2 \u2212 s\u20322 )\n31\n\n(E17)\n\n\fand having extracted a factor two from the square brackets.\n\n[1] G.
