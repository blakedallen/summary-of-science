It is a rapidly\nrotating star, with one of the shortest rotational periods of this class (Prot \u2248 0.52d ).\nAccording to the Oblique Rotator Model (Babcock 1949), it is characterized by a magnetic\nfield with a mainly dipolar topology, with a strength of Bp = 3000 \u00b1 200 gauss at the pole,\nwhose axis is tilted of an angle \u03b2 = 74\u25e6 \u00b1 3\u25e6 with respect to the rotational one, which in\nturn subtends an angle i = 43\u25e6 \u00b1 7\u25e6 (Trigilio et al. 2000) to the direction of the Earth.\nThe magnetic field is also responsible for the inhomogeneous distribution of the chemical\nelements in the stellar photosphere, giving rise to photometric and spectroscopic variability.\nCU Vir shows continuum radio emission (Leone et al. 1994, 2004), explained as being\ndue to gyrosynchrotron process from electrons spiraling in a corotating magnetosphere.\nAccording the 3D model developed by Trigilio et al. (2004) for MCP stars, a radiativelydriven wind interacts with the magnetosphere, dividing it into three regions, namely the\n\"inner\", \"middle\" and \"outer\" magnetosphere. In the \"inner\" equatorial zone, the kinetic\nenergy density of the wind particle never exceeds the magnetic one, B 2 /8\u03c0 > (1/2)\u03c1v 2,\ngenerating a dense equatorial belt. In the outer region, the path of the ionized wind from\nthe polar cups is first traced by the dipolar field, then, where B 2 /8\u03c0 < (1/2)\u03c1v 2 , it is mainly\nradial. In the thin middle magnetosphere, particles evaporating from a ring around the\nmagnetic poles propagates along the dipolar field lines, breaking them at the Alfv\u00e9n radius\n(B 2 /8\u03c0 \u2248 (1/2)\u03c1v 2 ), generating current sheets where particle acceleration occurs. The\nenergetic particles spread into the middle magnetosphere, emitting by the gyrosynchrotron\nmechanism. For CU Vir, a weak wind with a mass-loss rate of the order of 10\u221212 M\u2299 year\u22121\ncan explain the almost flat spectra and rotational modulation.\nThe distinctive behaviour of CU Vir is the presence of pulses of coherent, 100%\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ncircularly polarized, highly directive radio emission at 1.4 GHz (Trigilio et al. 2000). Pulses\nare observed two times every stellar rotation, when the magnetic axis of the dipole is\nperpendicular to the line of sight. This process has been observed for over ten years\n(Trigilio et al. 2000, 2008; Ravi et al. 2010), and it is interpreted as Electron Cyclotron\nMaser Emission (ECME) originating above the magnetic pole (Trigilio et al. 2000, 2008).\nIn the framework of the previous model, the relativistic electrons in a converging flux tube\nreflect outwards when they arrive close to the star, some fraction of them falling into the\nstellar photosphere. This causes a loss cone anisotropy which is responsible for the maser\nemission.\nAnother important aspect of the two pulses is that, assuming the emission source is\nfixed, they represent an ideal marker of the stellar rotation. An abrupt variation of the\nrotational period of CU Vir has been claimed from optical photometric study by Pyper et al.\n(1998). A change of the period from the radio pulses study has been measured with great\naccuracy by Trigilio et al. (2008).\nIn order to study the spectral and temporal behaviour of the pulses, the magnetospheric\nplasma, the spin down of this star, we observed CU Vir with the EVLA with unprecedented\nspectral and temporal sensitivity in two bands around the wavelength of 18 cm.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Data Reduction\n\nThe observations were carried out with the EVLA (Perley et al. 2011) in D\nconfiguration, in two days, on April 23rd, from 03:36 to 10:35 UT, and on April 30th 2010,\nform 01:39 to 08:38 UT. The date of the observations have been coordinated in order\nto cover the whole rotational period of CU Vir (about 12 hours) with two 7-hours slots,\nwith a minimum overlap of rotational phase. We used all the 22 telescopes equipped with\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Dynamical spectra of the circular polarization (Stokes V) flux density of CU Vir;\nthe corresponding heliocentric rotational phase is also shown. Left panel) first day: a broad\npeak, labeled \"a\", centered at 8 UT is visible; Right panel) second day: two peaks, one at 3\nUT, \"b\", one at 7:30 UT, \"c\", are visible. Peak \"a\" and \"b\" appear at the same rotational\nphase (0.5-0.6); The peak \"c\" appears at phase 0.95-1. Vertical lines show that the peaks at\n\u03c6 \u2248 0.55 occur early at low frequency; conversely, the peak at \u03c6 \u2248 0.95 occurs early at high\nfrequency.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nthe L-band receivers, tuned in two bands centered at 1452 and 1860 MHz respectively,\neach one with a bandwidth of 128 MHz split into 64 channels, with a frequency resolution\nof 2 MHz, in full polarization mode. The acquisition on CU Vir was alternated with\nthose on the point-like source J1354-0206, used as phase calibrator, with a duty cycle of\n1m 30s \u2212 9m 30s \u2212 1m 30s . The amplitude scale was determined by observations of the primary\ncalibrator 3C286 (F1.4 = 14.58, F1.8 = 12.9 Jy). Data reduction and editing were performed\nby using the Common Astronomy Software Applications package (casa). Data\ninspection revealed much radio interference in both bands, occurring in certain blocks of\ntime and of channels. Bad data have been edited first in the scans of the two calibrators.\nBandpass correction has been eventually determined by using the visibilities of 3C286, then\nflux densities of J1354-0206 have been obtained (F1.4 = 774, F1.8 = 854 mJy). Complex\ngains have then been applied to the data of CU Vir which have been edited after calibration.\nStokes I and V maps of the regions around the phase calibrator and the target have been\nobtained for the two days.\nIn order to get dynamical spectra of our target, visibilities of CU Vir have been\nimported into the Astronomical Image Processing System (aips), where the task\ndftpl computes the direct Fourier Transform at a given position in the sky as a function\nof the time. Stokes V flux densities have been computed for all frequencies, with time and\nspectral resolution of 2 MHz and 4 min respectively, giving an rms of about 1 mJy, as\nexpected.\nNo Stokes I or V variability has been found for J1354-0206, neither for the several\nsources close to CU Vir.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\n25\n\nCU Vir \u2212 V Polarization \u2212 1450 MHz\nc\n\nV pol Flux (mJy)\n\n20\n15\n\nc\n\n23 Apr\n30 Apr\n\n10\n\na\n\na\nb\n\n5\n\nb\n\n0\n\u22125\n0.0\n\n25\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\nRotational Phase\n\n2.0\n\nCU Vir \u2212 V Polarization \u2212 1850 MHz\nc\n\n20\nV pol Flux (mJy)\n\n1.5\n\nc\n\n15\n10\n\na\n\na\nb\n\n5\n\nb\n\n0\n\u22125\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\nRotational Phase\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nFig. 2.- Frequency average of the polarized emission as a function of the rotational phase\nfor the two bands.\n3.\n\nThe Cyclotron Maser\n\nDynamical spectra are shown in Fig. 1. Heliocentric rotational phases, computed by\nusing the ephemeris by Pyper et al. (1998), indicate that the peak \"a\" of April 23rd and\nthe \"b\" of April 30th occur at the same phase (\u03c6 \u2248 0.55), when the star is oriented in space\nin the same way relatively to the Earth. Fig. 2 shows the polarized flux average in the two\nbands as a function of the rotational phase, stressing the coincidence in phase of \"a\" and\n\"b\" events and a significant level of variability between the two observations. All the three\nevents last approximately 1 hour each; \"c\" exhibits a single peak of flux levels of about 20\nmJy; \"a\" and \"b\" lower and broader emission, with two components in the \"b\" event. The\nphase difference between \"a\" (or \"b\") and \"c\" events is about 0.4. This allows to recognize\nthe same peaks of emission reported by Trigilio et al. (2000), Trigilio et al. (2008) and\nRavi et al. (2010). The difference with the previous observations is the rotational phase of\neach peak, not the difference of phase between them. The variability of the pulse shape, as\nwell as the amplitude, could be due to some instability of the emission region, as proposed\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nby Ravi et al. (2010). Many parameters enter in the growth rate \u03c9 of the cyclotron maser\n(Mutel et al. 2007) such as electron density, velocity distribution (f ) and its anisotropy\n(\u2202f /\u2202v\u22a5 ), plasma frequency (\u03bdp ) and others. Since the growth rate is a non linear function\nof them, and the intensity of an unsaturated maser is I \u221d exp(\u03c9), even a small variation of\none of the above parameters can result in a significant variation of the emerging flux.\n\n3.1.\n\nThe change of the rotational period\n\nAn abrupt period change of 2.18 seconds, occurring probably in 1985, has been claimed\nby Pyper et al. (1998) from the analysis of photometric data; a new spin down of about 1\nsecond has been inferred by (Trigilio et al. 2008) from the phase shift of the coherent radio\nemission between 1998 and 1999. Now, with a new set of points after 12 years, and with the\ninclusion of the Ravi et al. (2010) results, the spin down is confirmed and the increment of\nthe rotational period \u2206P is determined with great accuracy by fitting the midpoints of the\ntwo peaks (circles and line in Fig. 3): \u2206P = 1.12 \u00b1 0.03 s. If we plot the phase of the peaks\nas a function of the epoch (Fig. 3), we see that they appear with a regularly increasing\ndelay, indicating that the rotational period of CU Vir has changed. Assuming that the\nchange of period occurred close to the observations of 1998, we determine new ephemeris of\nCU Vir:\nHJD = 2450966.3601 + 0.52071601E\nfor JD > 2450966, nominally June 1998. It is worthwhile to stress that this method of\nperiod determination gives a relative error of 7 \u00d7 10\u22127 .\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n3.2.\n\nThe direction of the beams\n\nAfter computing the actual rotational phases \u03c6 with the new ephemeris, it is possible\nto get the orientation of the star and its magnetosphere, then the direction of emission with\nrespect to the dipole axis. Assuming an inclination i = 43\u25e6 of the rotational axis and an\nobliquity \u03b2 = 74\u25e6 of the magnetic axis (Trigilio et al. 2000), the angle \u03c8 between the line of\nsight and the axis of the dipole is given by:\nsin \u03c8 = sin \u03b2 sin i cos(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 ) + cos \u03b2 cos i;\nhere \u03c60 = 0.08 is the phase delay of the magnetic curve with respect to the light curve\n(Borra & Landstreet 1980). The maximum visibility of the North magnetic hemisphere is\nat \u03c6 = 0.58, while at \u03c6 = 0.38 and 0.78 the magnetic axis lies in the plane of the sky.\nBy looking at the radio emission as a function of the inclination of the magnetic axis,\nwe can see how it escapes from the emitting region, i.e. we can study its directivity. The\ndirection of the emission beams at 1450 and 1850 MHz relatively to the dipole axis are\nshown in Fig. 4, top panel. Beams at higher frequency are emitted at \u03c8 \u2248 4\u25e6 , while at lower\nfrequency at \u03c8 \u2248 0\u25e6 , as the visibility of the peaks in Fig. 1 indicates. The emitting beams\nsubtend an angle \u2206\u03c8 . 10\u25e6 HPBW.\nThe cyclotron maser hypothesis in CU Vir has already been proposed by Trigilio et al.\n(2000, 2008). To be possible, the emission must originate in a region of relatively strong\nmagnetic field (\u03bdB >> \u03bdP ), and the plasma density in region above the magnetic pole must\nbe relatively low. Following the ECME theory (Melrose & Dulk 1982), the direction of\nemission forms an angle \u03b8 . 90\u25e6 (cos \u03b8 \u2248 v/c, where v is the upward velocity of the emitting\nelectrons) to the magnetic field direction with an aperture \u2206\u03b8 \u2248 v/c), forming an hollow\ncone. The frequency of the radiation is \u03bd & s \u03bdB , where s is the harmonic number. It is\nprobably the second harmonic which is the most efficient one, since emission at the first\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nharmonic is subject to gyromagnetic absorption of nearby thermal plasma at s = 2, and for\na higher harmonic number the maser has less efficient amplification. Assuming s = 2, the\nemission occurs where \u03bd = 2 \u00d7 2.8B/G MHz. For our two observing frequencies of 1450\nand 1850 MHz, the corresponding magnetic field is respectively 259 and 330 G and, with\na polar field strength Bpol = 3000 G, the observed emission arises respectively at R = 2.26\nand 2.09 R\u2217 from the center of the star.\nThere are however some problems with the hollow cone beaming model. In fact, if the\nemission arises from a ring around the polar axis and if the emission is in direction \u03b8 . 90\u25e6 ,\nwe should observe much broader peaks, since the inclination of the magnetic field lines with\nrespect to the line of sight changes in the emitting rings (see Fig. 4 of Trigilio et al. (2008)).\nSo the open questions are:\n-why do we not observe broad peaks?\n-why does the angle of emission change with the frequency?\n\n4.\n\n\"Auroral\" emission\n\nThe cyclotron maser of CU Vir shares with the radio emission from planets some\ncharacteristics, suggesting a common scenario. There are five planets with magnetospheres\nin the Solar System (Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) known to show intense\nradio emission at low frequency (from 10 kHz up to few MHz), originating above the high\nmagnetic latitude auroral regions (Zarka 1998). This emission is non-thermal, with high\nbrightness temperature exceeding 1015 K, 100% circularly polarized, highly beamed. All\nthose characteristics indicate that the emission process is cyclotron maser. Except for\nthe case of the Jovian decametric emission (DAM) at 10 \u2212 40 MHz, which is due to the\nIo-magnetosphere interaction, the auroral emissions are controlled by the solar wind flowing\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\ninto the open field lines above the polar caps. The analogy with CU Vir is unexpected,\nincluding the \"pulsar like\" behaviour due to the rotation of an oblique dipole axis.\nRecent observations of the terrestrial Auroral Kilometric Radiation (AKR), performed\nwith the four-spacecraft Cluster array, have allowed the location of the sources from\nwhich the emission originates (Mutel et al. 2003) and the determination of its the angular\nbeaming characteristics (Mutel et al. 2008). The emission seems to be the sum of several\nelementary bursts of radiation generated at a height where the gyrofrequency of the\nelectrons corresponds to the magnetic field (at 0.5 \u2212 2R\u2295 ), in a ring around the magnetic\naxis where the density is very low (the so-called \"auroral cavity\"). Unlike the Jovian\nDAM, where the emission is beamed in a thin (\u2206\u03b8 \u2248 1\u25e6 ) hollow cone of half-angle \u03b8 . 90\u25e6\n(Dulk 1970), the AKR is radiated within \u00b115\u25e6 from the \"plane tangent to the source's\nmagnetic latitude circle and containing the local magnetic field vector\" (Mutel et al. 2008;\nLouarn & Le Qu\u00e9au 1996). The important point we want to stress is that the emission is\nemitted tangentially to the auroral ring.\nDuring the propagation in the close ambient medium, the AKR is deviated upwards\nbecause of the refractive index of the dense magnetospheric plasma.\n\n4.1.\n\nA new model for CU Vir\n\nThe results of AKR suggest that the ECME of CU Vir could come from the same\ngeometry. We propose a new scenario, where the masing emission does not follow the\n\"hollow cone model\", instead the \"tangent plane beaming model\". Fig. 4 shows a sketch of\nthe Cyclotron Maser emission from CU Vir. Electrons traveling back from the acceleration\nregion located at Alfv\u00e9n radius RAlf = 15 R\u2217 (Leto et al. 2006) emit at locations where the\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nmagnetic field strength corresponds to the first or second gyromagnetic harmonic (s = 1, 2).\nThese define annular rings above the magnetic pole. The amplification occurs tangentially,\nso that it is seen from Earth to came from the two extreme points of the rings. They would\nbe seen simultaneously at any frequency as the star rotates, in the absence of subsequent\nrefraction.\nOur 3-D model (Trigilio et al. 2004; Leto et al. 2006) foresees the existence of a cold\ntorus around the magnetic equator. The absorption of this optically thick material can\naccount for the rotational modulation of the continuous gyrosynchrotron emission, in\nparticularly at high frequency radiation (\u03bd > 15 GHz), emitted exactly in the same region\nwhere the cyclotron maser originates. From the results of the simulation, the number\ndensity of the cold torus is Ntorus \u2248 109 cm\u22123 , with a temperature Ttorus \u2248 104 K.\nWe now consider the case of s = 2, and will give some consideration for the case s = 1.\nDuring the propagation, the maser radiation crosses the torus. The plasma of the torus,\npermeated by a magnetic field B \u2248 260 and 330 G (the levels of the propagation of the two\nfrequency bands) has a refractive index in the extraordinary mode given by:\ns\n\u03bdP2\nnrefr \u2248 1 \u2212\n\u03bd(\u03bd \u2212 \u03bdB )\nIn the following, we will give an order of magnitude estimate of the deviation of the emission\n(angle \u03c8) with respect to the original, horizontal, ray path. The refractive index inside the\ntorus, assuming an average Ntorus as above, but with higher density in the inner part, and\nthe local field strength, can easily reach values of nrefr \u2248 0.98 and 0.95 for \u03bd = 1450 and\n1850 MHz respectively. This means that the maximum deviation toward high values of the\nangle \u03c8 occurs at 1850 MHz, in agreement with our observations. The actual angle \u03c8 can\nbe obtained in a simply way from the Snell law if the angle of incidence with the interface\nbetween the two media at different refractive index, i.e. the surface defined by the field lines\nconfining the cold torus, is known. In the case that this angle is 60\u25e6 , \u03c8 \u2248 10\u25e6 at 1850 MHz\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nand \u03c8 \u2248 5\u25e6 at 1450 MHz, accounting for the observed difference (see Fig. 4).\nIn the case s = 1, this simple computation foresees bigger deviations upwards, not\nin agreement with the observations. However, a more detailed numerical computation is\nneeded in order to better constrain the actual harmonic number s and get more precise\nindications on the physical conditions of the emitting plasma and of the surrounding region.\n\n5.\n\nConclusion and future perspective\n\nThe observations reported here of CU Vir confirm the presence of a steady cyclotron\nmaser operating over more than 10 years in the magnetosphere of this star. Our model\nproposes that the process is triggered by the continuous injection of high energy electrons\nflowing from the Alfv\u00e9n region, about 15 stellar radii from the star, to the inner parts of the\nmagnetosphere. Those electrons are also responsible for the gyrosynchrotron emission. The\noverall mechanism is powered by the radiation driven wind interacting with the magnetic\nfield.\nThe high temporal and spectral resolution of the current EVLA allowed us to get\ndynamical spectra over two broad spectral regions. The observations have been carried\nin two days, covering almost the whole rotational period of CU Vir. This allowed us to\nmeasure with great accuracy the delay of the peaks of emission, and so to determine with\nunprecedented precision (\u2248 10\u22127 ) the rotational period of the star, confirming the spin\ndown of this young star. Further observations are needed in order to monitor the rotation of\nCU Vir, since the emission peaks are believed to be \"perfect markers\" of this stellar clock.\nThere is an impressive similarity between the cyclotron maser of CU Vir and the\ncoherent radio emission from planets. The recent observations of the Auroral Kilometric\nRadiation from the terrestrial magnetosphere and the new interpretation on the basis of the\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\"tangent plane beaming model\" gave the opportunity to formulate a new model for CU Vir,\nwhere the emission is \"auroral-type\", emitted tangentially to the auroral circles.\nThe analysis of the dynamical spectra permitted us to clearly see that the pulses\noccurred at slightly different times inside the frequency band. In the framework of the new\nmodel, this could be due to refractive effects due to the propagation of the radiation inside\na denser magnetized plasma surrounding the star in the magnetic equatorial belt. This is a\nfurther indication of the existence of a \"cold torus\", which also acts as an absorber of the\ngyrosynchrotron continuous emission at centimeter wavelengths.\nIn the near future the EVLA will increase its maximum bandwidth up to 2 GHz.\nThis will allow us to extend the dynamical spectra in a broader spectral region and to\nbetter define the low and high limits of the cyclotron maser. The time visibility of the\npeaks as a function of the frequency will allow us to study and model with great precision\nthe propagation of the radiation in the magnetospheric plasma surrounding the star.\nCU Vir is an excellent astrophysical laboratory for plasma physics in stellar and planetary\nenvironment.\n\nWe thank the NRAO scheduler who coordinated the times of the two observations to\ncover almost the whole rotational period of CU Vir.
