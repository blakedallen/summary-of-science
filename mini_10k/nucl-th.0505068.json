Using different\nwave functions we fitted their parameters to the experimental data of the\npion form factor, obtainig great discrepancy at low momentum transfer.\nIntroducing the Vector Meson Dominance corrective factor, we obtained a\nbetter fit to the data.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn a previous work [1] we introduced a covariant impulse approximation method\nfor the study of scattering processes on composite systems. We briefly recall that\nin the impulse approximation one constituent interacts with the external field,\nwhile the others, the spectators, do not change their momenta in the interaction\nprocess. In the present paper we derive, by means of a gauge invariant procedure,\nthe specific form of the electromagnetic current operator for a system made up by\ntwo scalars constituents.\nAfter discussing some general properties of the obtained current operator, we study\na numerical application to reproduce the experimental behavior of the pion form\nfactor, being aware that in the present simplified \"scalar\" model all the spin effects are neglected. Also, we verify that the approximations of the procedure as\nsuch do not allow to reproduce the form factor at low momentum transfer. To\nremedy to this failure we introduce a suitable Vector Meson Dominance (VMD)\ncorrective factor, consistently with the other assumptions of the model. This VMD\nfactor takes into account, in a phenomenological way, all our \"ignorance\" about\nthe structure of the bound state explored at low momentum transfer.\n1\n\n\fWe point out that the main aim of the present work is to analyze in a clear way\nour procedure for deriving a conserved current with the simplest dynamical model,\nthat is two scalar interacting constituents.\nThe same procedure, applied to the much more complex case represented by the\nnucleon as a three-quark relativistic composite system, is currently under examination and gives very good results for the study of the electric and magnetic nucleon\nform factors [2]. Furthermore, in a subsequent work we shall study the pion form\nfactor by considering a model with two spin 1/2 -quark antiquark- particles.\nThe present work is organized as follows: In section 2, we analyze the dynamical relativistic model and extract from the wave equation the conserved current.\nFinally in section 3 we introduce the VMD factor and draw some conclusions.\n\n2\n\nThe dynamical model and the gauge current\n\nWe firstly introduce the relativistic wave-equation for the two-body system. In its\nrest frame (RF) it has the standard form of a positive energy relativistic integral\nequation [3]\nZ\n[M \u2212 2E(p)]\u03c6(~\np) = d3 p\u2032 W (~\np, p~\u2032 )\u03c6(p~\u2032 ),\n(2.1)\nwhere\n\np~ = p~\u22171 = \u2212p~\u22172\n\n(2.2)\n\nrepresents the relative momentum of the constituents; hereafter, the asterisk denotes the quantities referred to the RF;\np\n(2.3)\nE = E1\u2217 = E2\u2217 = m2 + p~2\n\nrepresents the kinetic energy of the constituents, being m their mass; finally,\nW (~\np, p~\u2032 ) denotes the interaction operator.\nIn a generic reference frame that is chosen for the observation of the scattering\nprocess, called Observation Reference Frame (ORF), the 4-momenta, on-shell, of\nthe two constituents p1 , p2 , are obtained with a Lorentz transformation on the corresponding quantities of the RF. Standard calculations give the following relation:\np1 + p2 =\n\nP\n\u0112,\nM\n\nwhere\n\n(2.4)\n\nP p1\n.\n(2.5)\nM\nIn the previous equations the total observable 4-momentum of the system P is introduced with P 2 = P\u03bc P \u03bc = M 2 . Equation (2.4) represents the main assumption\nof the present model that is based on the use of on-shell momenta as dynamical\nspatial variables.\n\u0112 = 2E(p) = 2\n\n2\n\n\fAlso, by means of the last two equations it is easily shown that in an ORF, the onshell 4-momentum p2 can be considered as a function of p1 and P . In consequence\nwe can make for the explicitly covariant wave-equation in an ORF the following\nhypothesis:\nZ\nd3 p\u20321\nP p1\n]F \u03c6 =\nV (p1 , p\u20321 , P )F \u2032 \u03c6\u2032 ,\n(2.6)\n[M \u2212 2\nM\nE(p\u20321 )\nbeing F an invariant function: F = F (p1 , P ). Calculating the previous equation\nin the RF, the requirement of hermiticity of the interaction leads to\n\u00131/2\n\u0012\np\np\nP p1\nF (p1 , P ) = E(p) = E1\u2217 =\n,\n(2.7)\nM\nand, comparing with equation (2.1), one finds that the interaction of the ORF\nequation is related to that of the RF by the following relation:\n\nAlso\n\n1\n1\n\u2032\np, p~\u2032 ).\nV (p1 , p\u20321 , P ) \u2032 = W (p~\u22171 , p~\u22171 ) = W (~\nF\nF\n\n(2.8)\n\n\u03c6(p1 , P ) = \u03c6(p~\u22171 (p1 , P )).\n\n(2.9)\n\nThe last equation shows that the rest frame momentum must be expressed as a\nfunction of the ORF momentum p1 and of the total 4-momentum P by means of\na standard Lorentz transformation.\nStarting from the covariant wave equation in the ORF of equation (2.6), we derive\nthe gauge invariant conserved current by means of the following procedure.\n1. We specialize equation (2.6) to the initial state, that is P = PI .\n2. To obtain the current related to the constituent 2, being the constituent 1\nthe spectator, one should multiply by its charge, e2 . However, in the example\nunder examination, due to the symmetries of the wave function, to derive\nthe total current one can directly multiply by the total charge of the system,\ndenoted by Q.\n3. We multiply by F (p1 , PF )\u03c6+ (p1 , PF ) and perform the covariant integration\nR d3 p1\n.\nover E(p\n1)\n\n4. We repeat this procedure for the h.c. wave function of the final state.\n\nSubtracting the two results we obtain\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0014 \u03bd\u0015\nZ\nd3 p1 +\nP\np1\u03bd F (p1 , PI )\u03c6(p1 , PI )\n\u03c6 (p1 , PF )F (p1 , PF ) \u2206[M ] \u2212 2\u2206\nQ\nE(p1 )\nM\n=Q\n\nZ\n\nd3 p1 d3 p\u20321 +\n\u03c6 (PF , p1 )F (PF , p1 )\u2206[V (p1 , p\u20321 , P )]F (PI , p1 )\u03c6(PI , p1 ),\nE(p1 ) E(p\u20321 )\n(2.10)\n3\n\n\fwhere the notation\n\u2206[O(P )] = O(PF ) \u2212 O(PI )\n\n(2.11)\n\nhas been introduced. In particular, we point out that in all the \u2206 quantities in\nequation (2.10) the momentum transfer q \u03bc = (PF\u03bc \u2212 PI\u03bc ) can be factorized. We\nhave\n2K \u03bc\n,\n(2.12)\n\u2206[M ] = q\u03bc\nMF + MI\n\u0014 \u03bd\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\nP\n1 MF + MI \u03bc\u03bd\n2K \u03bc K \u03bd\n\u2206\n= q\u03bc\n,\n(2.13)\ng \u2212\nM\n2 MF MI\nMF MI (MF + MI )\nwith\n\n1\n(PF + PI ).\n(2.14)\n2\nAlso, \u2206[V (p1 , p\u20321 , P )] can be expressed in a similar way as it will be shown in a\nsubsequent work. We obtain a current JF\u03bc I that satisfies the gauge condition\nK=\n\nq\u03bc JF\u03bc I = 0.\n\n(2.15)\n\nIn this paper we study the terms obtained from the LHS of equation (2.10) that\nrepresent the \"kinetic\" contributions. We have:\nZ\nd3 p1 +\n(k)\u03bc\n\u03c6 (PF , p1 )F (PF , p1 )\n(2.16)\nJF I = Q\nE(p1 )\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2K \u03bc\n2K \u03bc K \u03bd\n1 MF + MI \u03bc\u03bd\n\u00d7\np1\u03bd F (PI , p1 )\u03c6(PI , p1 ),\n+\ng \u2212\nMF + MI\n2 MF MI\nMF MI (MF + MI )\nnote that the matrix-element of the current of the last equation is of the same\nkind of that introduced in our previous work -see equation (3.8) of [1]-. In other\nwords, the contribution to the current coming from the kinetic energy of the covariant wave equation gives rise to a term of impulse approximation form, where\nthe spectator's 4-momentum p1 remains unchanged. The operator of the interacting particle that is represented in the present work by the term in the parenthesis\nof equation (2.16), was generically denoted as \u00d42 in equation (3.8) of [1]. Furthermore, standard but tedious calculations show that, in the present model, this\noperator, in the limit of free constituents, is proportional to p\u03bc2F + p\u03bc2I as it must be\nfor scalar particles. Finally, the factors E \u22121 (p1 ), F (PF , p1 ), F (PI , p1 ) represent\nthe covariant normalization factors of the wave function, also introduced in [1].\nIn the following we study the case of elastic scattering, that is, MF = MI ; the\nelastic form factor is related to the matrix-elements of the current by the following\nequation:\nK\u03bc\nJF\u03bc I =\nF (q 2 ),\n(2.17)\nM\n\n4\n\n\fthat will be used to determine F (q 2 ).\nFor the calculations the Breit reference frame will be used. In this frame, one has\n!\n\u0015\n\u0014\n2 1/2\n~\nq\nq\n(2.18)\n,\u00b1\nPF/I =\nM2 +\n4\n2\nq = (0, ~q)\n\u0014\n\u00151/2 !\nq2\n2\nK=\nM +\n, ~0 .\n4\n\n(2.19)\n(2.20)\n\nAlso, the momentum transfer ~\nq is taken along the \u1e91 axis. In consequence, for an\nelastic scattering, in the Breit Frame, the matrix elements of the current take the\nform\nZ\nd3 p1 \u2020\n(k,Breit)\u03bc\nJF I\n=Q\n\u03c6 (PF , p1 )F (PF , p1 )I \u03bc F (PI , p1 )\u03c6(PI , p1 ),\n(2.21)\nE(p1 )\nwhere, from equation (2.16), I \u03bc has the form\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 q2\nE\n1+\nE(p\n)\n,\nI0 =\n1\nM\n2 EM 2\n\n(2.22)\n\np~1\nI~ = \u22122 .\n(2.23)\nM\nNote that, even though equation (2.16) only represents the kinetic contribution to\nthe current, this current is conserved, in elastic scattering on a scalar composite\nsystem. This property can be proved by means of invariance under parity transformations.\nTo this aim let us consider the operator pz1 , which is the only one appearing in\nthe current conservation relations. It satisfies the following relation under parity\ntransformation:\n(2.24)\nP \u2020 pz1 P = \u2212pz1 .\nFurthermore, in this case, that is, elastic scattering on a scalar state in the Breit\nframe, the parity transformation interchanges the initial and final states:\nP F (PI , p1 )\u03c6(PI , p1 ) = F (PF , p1 )\u03c6(PF , p1 ).\n\n(2.25)\n\nThe last two equations are sufficient to prove current conservation, that, due to\nthe covariance of the model, holds in all the reference frames.\nConsidering the numerical results for the form factor, we found that with standard\nwave-functions as gaussian, Hulten, or the modified Hulten that will be introduced\nlater, this simple scalar model reproduces the high momentum transfer behavior of\nthe pion form factor, while the low momentum transfer region cannot be correctly\nreproduced. An example is shown in figure 1.

[5])\n\n6\n\n4\n\n\fhighly non perturbative character of the system when explored at low momentum\ntransfer, i.e. at large spatial distance.\nOn the other hand, the model, being essentially a relativistic impulse approximation, explains correctly the \"partonic\" behavior at high momentum transfer, i.e.\nat short spatial distance.\nA phenomenological way to improve the model is to introduce the so called Vector\nMeson Dominance, as it will be explained in the next section.\n\n3\n\nThe Vector Meson Dominance corrective factor\n\nThe Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) is an old model that has been extensively\nused for the study of the electro-weak interactions of hadronic systems. As for the\nelectron scattering processes, the initial photon interacts not only in a direct way\nwith the hadronic system, but also by means of an intermediate meson (\u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c6, ...)\nhaving the same (vector) quantum numbers as the photon. In consequence the\nbare electromagnetic vertex is multiplied by the following factor\n\u0013n\n\u0012\nm2V\n,\n(3.1)\nf V = 1 \u2212 \u03b2V + \u03b2V\n\u2212kV2 + m2V\nwhere mV and kV2 represent the mass and the 4-momentum transfer squared of\nthe virtual vector meson, respectively. Also, \u03b2V represents the \"intensity\" of the\nvector meson coupling. In the last term of the previous equation we recognize\nstraightforwardly the vector meson propagator. The expression of fV in (3.1) is\nconstructed in such way that, when the momentum transfer is vanishing, the charge\nnormalization of the electromagnetic current is not affected, being fV (kV2 = 0) = 1.\nFor the present example, unessential isospin operators are neglected.\nIn standard VMD models, a monopole form n = 1 is considered and kV2 is taken\nof the same magnitude as the virtual photon momentum transfer, that is\n2\nkV2 = q\u03bc q \u03bc = \u2212~q(Breit)\n.\n\n(3.2)\n\nOn the other hand, in the present work we assume that the state of the vector\nmeson is determined by the dynamics of the hadronic constituent to which the\nvector meson is coupled, that is the # 2. For this reason we take\nkV2 = (pF,2 \u2212 pI,2 )2 ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nthat is the difference squared of the on shell momenta of the interacting constituent\nin the initial and final state; their explicit expression is obtained by means of\nequations (2.4) and (2.5). The same implementation of the VMD has been used\nto study the weak current of the nucleon in a relativistic quark model [6].\nMultiplying I \u03bc by fV with the assumption of equation (3.3) and performing the\nintegration, we obtain the final result of the model.\n7\n\n\fFor the wave function we have taken a modified Hulten function given by the\nfollowing expression\nC\n(3.4)\n\u03c6(~\np) = \u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011b .\na\n2\n2\n1 + \u03b1p~ 2\n1 + \u03b2p~ 2\n\nThe values of the parameters a and b being C the normalization constant, are\nchosen to reproduce the pion form factor and are given in the figure 1.\n\nIn conclusion, this very simple scalar model has been used to study some good\nproperties of the covariant impulse approximation introduced in [1]. With the\nsame model we tried to reproduce the pion form factor also introducing the effects\nof the VMD consistently with the other assumptions of the model.\n\nReferences\n[1] M. De Sanctis, M. A.
