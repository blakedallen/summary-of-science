The new theory can\ndeal with a dislocation spreading at more than one slip planes. As an example, we study dislocation\ncross-slip and constriction process of two fcc metals, Al and Ag. The energetic parameters entering\nthe model are determined from ab initio calculations. We find that the screw dislocation in Al can\ncross-slip spontaneously in contrast with that in Ag, which splits into partials and cannot cross-slip\nwithout first being constricted. The dislocation response to an external stress is examined in detail.\nWe determine dislocation constriction energy and critical stress for cross-slip, and from the latter,\nwe estimate the cross-slip energy barrier for the straight screw dislocations.\n\n1\n\n\fThe cross-slip process by which a screw dislocation moves from one slip plane to another, plays an important role for plastic deformation in materials. For example, cross-slip\nis responsible for the onset of stage III of the stress-strain work-hardening curve; it is also\nresponsible for the anomalous high temperature yield stress peak observed in L12 intermetallic alloys. However cross-slip has been a tough problem to tackle because it contains\nboth long-ranged elastic interactions between dislocation segments and short-ranged atomic\ninteractions due to the constriction process, in which the two partial dislocations have to be\nrecombined into a screw dislocation before cross-slip takes place.\nThere are currently two theoretical approaches to study cross-slip. One is based on the\nline tension approximation which completely ignores atomic interactions [1, 2]. The other\napproach is direct atomistic simulations employing empirical potentials [3, 4]. Although the\nsecond approach is quite powerful in determining cross-slip transition path and estimating\nthe corresponding activation energy barrier, it is time-consuming and critically depends on\nthe accuracy and availability of the empirical potentials employed in the simulations. In\nthis Letter, we present an alternative approach to study cross-slip process based on the\nPeierls framework with ab initio calculations of relevant energetics. In fact, there has been\na resurgence of interest recently in applying the simple and tractable Peierls-Nabarro (P-N)\nmodel to study dislocation core structure and mobility in conjunction with ab initio \u03b3surface calculations [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. This approach represents a combination of atomistic\n(ab initio) treatment of interactions across the slip plane and elastic treatment for the\ncontinua that are away from the slip plane. Therefore this approach is particularly useful\nfor studying interactions of impurities and dislocations, when empirical potentials are either\nnot available or not reliable to deal with such multi-elements systems. However, to date\nall the models based on the Peierls framework are only applicable to single slip plane while\ncross-slip process requires at least two active intersecting slip planes, i.e., the primary and\ncross-slip planes. It is the purpose of this Letter to introduce a novel P-N model that involves\ntwo intersecting slip planes. This development represents the first effort to extend the P-N\nmodel, one of the central themes of dislocation theory, to more than one slip planes, which\nopens doors to many exciting applications. As an example, we shall apply this new model\nto study dislocation constriction and cross-slip process in Al and Ag. Not only can this\nmodel be used to study dislocation cross-slip, it can also be applied to examine dislocation\njunctions and other processes involved multiple slip planes.\n2\n\n\fWe begin by developing an appropriate energy functional for a Peierls dislocation at two\nintersecting slip planes. To facilitate presentation, we adopt the following conventions : In\nFig. 1, a screw dislocation placed at the intersection of the primary (plane I) and cross-slip\nplane (plane II) is allowed to spread into the two planes simultaneously. The X (X \u2032 ) axis\nrepresents the glide direction of the dislocation at the plane I (II). For an fcc lattice, the two\nslip planes are (111) and (1\u030411), forming an angle \u03b8 \u2248 71\u25e6 . The dislocation line is along the\n[101\u0304] (Z axis) direction and L represents the outer radius of the dislocation beyond which\nthe elastic energy is ignored. In the spirit of P-N model, the dislocation is represented as a\ncontinuous distribution of infinitesimal dislocations with densities of \u03c1I (x) and \u03c1II (x\u2032 ) on the\nprimary and cross slip planes respectively. Here x and x\u2032 are the coordinates of the atomic\nrows at the two planes. Following the semidiscrete Peierls framework developed earlier [7, 9],\nwe can write the total energy of the dislocation as Utot = UI + UII + \u0168 . Here UI and UII\nare the energies associated with the dislocation spread on the plane I and II, respectively\nand \u0168 represents the elastic interaction energy between the dislocation densities on planes I\nand II. UI and UII are essentially the same expression given earlier for the single plane case\n[7, 9], while \u0168 is a new term and can be derived from Nabarro's equation for general parallel\ndislocations [11],\nUI(II) =\n\nX\ni,j\n\n1\nI(II)\nI(II)\nI(II)\nI(II)\nI(II)\nI(II)\n\u03c7ij {Ke [\u03c11 (i)\u03c11 (j) + \u03c12 (i)\u03c12 (j)] + Ks \u03c13 (i)\u03c13 (j)}\n2\n\u0010\n\nI(II)\n\nI(II)\n\n+\n\nX\n\n\u2206x\u03b33 f1\n\n\u0168 = \u2212\n\nX\n\nKs \u03c1I3 (i)\u03c1p3 (j)Aij\n\n\u2212\n\nX\n\nKe [\u03c1I2 (i)\u03c1p2 (j)Bij\n\ni\n\n(i), f2\n\n\u2212\n\nI(II)\n\n(i), f3\n\nX\n\n\u0011\n\n(i) \u2212\n\nX\ni,l\n\nKe [\u03c1I1 (i)\u03c1p1 (j)\n\nx(i)2 \u2212 x(i \u2212 1)2 I(II)\nI(II)\n\u03c1l (i)\u03c4l\n+ Kb2 lnL,\n2\n\n+ \u03c1I2 (i)\u03c1p2 (j)]Aij\n\ni,j\n\ni,j\n\n+ \u03c1I1 (i)\u03c1p1 (j)Cij \u2212 \u03c1I2 (i)\u03c1p1 (j)Dij \u2212 \u03c1I1 (i)\u03c1p2 (j)Dij ] .\n\ni,j\n\nI(II)\n\nHere f1\n\nI(II)\n\n(i), f2\n\nI(II)\n\n(i) and f3\n\n(i) represent the edge, vertical and screw component of\n\nthe general dislocation displacement at the i-th nodal point in the plane I(II), respectively, while the corresponding component of dislocation density in plane I(II) is defined\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nas \u03c1I(II) (i) = f I(II) (i) \u2212 f I(II) (i \u2212 1) / (x(i) \u2212 x(i \u2212 1)). The projected dislocation density\n\u03c1p (i) is the projection of density \u03c1II (i) from plane II onto plane I in order to deal with nonparallel components of displacement. The \u03b3-surface, \u03b33 , which in general includes shearI(II)\n\ntension coupling can be determined from ab initio calculations. \u03c4l\nI(II)\n\ncomponents interacting with corresponding \u03c1l\n3\n\nis the external stress\n\n(i) (l = 1,2,3), which contributes to the to-\n\n\ftal energy as elastic work done by the stress [7].

The equilibrium structure of the dislocation\ncan be obtained by minimizing the total energy with respect to the dislocation density.\nTo contrast and understand different cross-slip behavior in Al and Ag, we have carried\nout ab initio calculations for the \u03b3-surface of Ag while the \u03b3-surface of Al has been published\nelsewhere [9]. A supercell containing six layers in the [111] direction is used to calculate the\n\u03b3-surface for Ag. The ab initio calculations are based on the pseudopotential plane-wave\nmethod [12] with a kinetic energy cutoff of 55 Ry for the plane-wave basis and a k-point grid\nconsisting of (16,16,4) divisions along the reciprocal lattice vectors. Owing to the planar nature of dislocation core structure of fcc metals, we disregard the displacement perpendicular\nto the slip planes and partially consider the shear-tension coupling by performing volume\nrelaxation along the [111] direction in the \u03b3-surface calculations. We present the complete\n\u03b3-surface for Ag in Fig. 2. The most striking difference between the \u03b3-surface of Ag and Al\nis the vast difference in intrinsic stacking fault energy, which is 165 mJ/m2 for Al and 14\nmJ/m2 for Ag. This dramatic difference in \u03b3-surface gives rise to very different dislocation\ncore structures and cross-slip behavior that we are going to explore.\n4\n\n\fThe model calculation is set up by introducing a screw dislocation at the intersection\nof the two slip planes without applying external stress to the system at first. The initial\nconfiguration of the dislocation is specified by a step function for the screw displacement\nf3I (x) = 0 for x < L and f3I (x) = b for x \u2265 L. All other displacement components including\nthose on the cross-slip plane are set to zero initially. This corresponds to a pure screw\ndislocation with a zero width \"spread\" on the primary plane. We then relax the dislocation\nstructure according to the energy functional. The Burgers vector of Ag, b = 2.84 \u00c5 is\ndetermined from ab initio calculations and elastic constants are chosen from experimental\nvalues [13]. The corresponding parameters of Al have been given elsewhere [9]. Having\ndetermined all the parameters entering the model, we obtain the equilibrium structure of\nthe dislocations, represented by their density \u03c1(x) shown in Fig. 3. The screw dislocation in\nAl which starts out at the primary plane spontaneously spreads into the cross-slip plane, as\nthe density peak at the cross-slip plane indicates. As expected, the edge component of the\ndensity is zero at the cross-slip plane because only screw displacement can cross-slip. On the\nother hand, the screw dislocation in Ag dissociates into two partials, separated by 7.8 b (\u2248\n22 \u00c5) distance. These partial dislocations cannot cross-slip, as the arrows indicate, without\nfirst annihilating their edge components, and the dislocation density on the cross-slip plane\nis essentially zero. The partial separation distance we obtained from the model calculation\nis in excellent agreement with the TEM measurement for that in Ag, which is about 20\n\u00c5 [14]. Apparently, the lack of obvious dissociation in Al stems from the fact that Al has\na much higher intrinsic stacking fault energy than that of Ag.\nIn order to examine the stress effect on dislocation core structure and cross-slip process, we\napply external Escaig stress to the dislocation. The Escaig stress with pure edge component\ninteracts only with the edge component of dislocation densities, extending or shrinking the\nstacking fault width depending on its sign. The results of the partial separation as a function\nof Escaig stress are summarized in Fig. 4. Without external stress, the partial separation is\n7.8 b for Ag and zero for Al. Under positive Escaig stress, the partial separation rises rapidly\nfor Ag whereas it remains zero in Al until the stress reaches the threshold to separate the\noverlapping partials. To activate cross-slip, however, one needs to apply a negative Escaig\nstress to annihilate the edge components of the partials' displacement, known as constriction\nprocess. Upon application of negative stress, the partials in Ag move towards each other and\nreduce the width of stacking fault. During this process, the edge components of displacement\n5\n\n\ffrom the two partials annihilate each other while the screw components are being built up.\nHowever there is a lower limit for the separation that one can achieve, which is 1.7 b for\nAg. This is in agreement with the atomistic simulations for Cu, reporting a corresponding\nvalue of 1.6 b [15]. In the wake of the (partial) constriction process, a pure screw dislocation\nsegment is formed at the intersection of the two planes, which can cross-slip. On the other\nhand, further increasing the negative stress does not complete the constriction but rather\nincreases the partial separation. This is due to the fact that the remaining edge components\nof the partials interact with the stress, and as a result the two partials exchange signs and\nmove away from each other until the lattice breaks down.\nWe have also estimated critical energetics that are relevant to cross-slip. For example, we\ncalculated constriction energy defined as the difference in dislocation core energy between\nthe normal and constricted states. By approximating the state with 1.7 b separation between\npartials as the constricted state, we were able to estimate the constriction energy for Ag to\nbe 0.05 eV/b. Obviously the constriction energy for Al is zero because its normal state is\nfully constricted. We have also calculated the critical stress for cross-slip which is defined as\nthe glide stress in the cross-slip plane to move a partially constricted dislocation from the\nprimary plane to the cross-slip plane [15]. The critical stress for cross-slip in Ag is found to\nbe 0.0105 eV/\u00c53 , comparing to 0.0020 eV/\u00c53 in Al. Finally we estimated cross-slip energy\nbarrier which in the context of our calculations is defined as the difference in dislocation core\nenergy before and after cross-slip takes place by applying the above mentioned critical stress\nfor cross-slip. In other words, we calculate the core energy difference for the dislocation\nbetween its normal state and the state that the dislocation just starts to cross-slip under\nthe critical cross-slip stress. Under this definition, we find the cross-slip energy barrier for\nAg as 0.31 eV/b, much greater than that of Al, which is 0.05 eV/b. Our result for the\ncross-slip energy barrier should not be compared directly to the corresponding experimental\nvalue because the dislocations are assumed to be straight in our current implementation of\nthe Peierls-Nabarro model. However it is possible to extend the present formalism to deal\nwith an arbitrarily curved dislocation where a more realistic cross-slip energy barrier can be\nobtained. Nevertheless the present model is still sufficient to provide reliable energetics for\nstraight dislocations.\nTo conclude, we have presented a novel model that can treat dislocation cross-slip and\nconstriction based on the Peierls-Nabarro framework. The \u03b3-surface entering the model is\n6\n\n\fdetermined from ab initio calculations which provide reliable atomic interactions across the\nslip plane. Using this model, we find that the screw dislocation in Al can spontaneously\nspread into cross-slip plane while the same dislocation in Ag splits into partials and cannot\ncross-slip. The dislocation response to external stresses is studied, and in particular negative\nEscaig stresses are applied to the dislocation to simulate constriction process. We find that\nit is impossible to achieve 100% constriction for straight partial dislocations. By computing\ndislocation core energy in different stress states, we are able to estimate dislocation constriction energy for Al and Ag. We have also calculated critical stress and energy barrier for\ndislocation cross-slip, and from which we confirm that dislocation cross-slip is much easier\nin Al than in Ag. Since our ab initio model calculation is much faster than direct ab initio\natomistic simulations, the model will be invaluable for alloy design where the goal is to select\n\"right\" elements with \"right\" composition for an alloy to have desired dislocation properties,\nsuch as cross-slip properties.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nTwo of us (G.L. and N.K.) acknowledge the support from Grant No. DAAD19-00-1-0049\nthrough the U.S. Army Research Office.
