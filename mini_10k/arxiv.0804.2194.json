Introduction\nOne way of exploring the quantum coherence properties of a nanomechanical resonator\nis to couple it to a qubit formed by a solid-state two-level system (TLS). Coupling to\nan isolated harmonic oscillator can initially cause an apparent loss of phase coherence\nin the qubit if the oscillator is driven into a superposition of orthogonal states, but\nsignatures of the overall coherence of the full system (i.e. oscillator and TLS together)\ncan be found in the subsequent dynamics of the TLS. However, if instead the qubit is\ncoupled to a harmonic oscillator which is in turn coupled to a bath, then the effective\ndynamics of the TLS and oscillator will now be different and the loss of the oscillator's\ncoherence due to the bath will be manifest in the dynamics of the TLS [1, 2, 3].\nFrom a theoretical point of view it is relatively straightforward to devise simple\nschemes based on these principles to probe the rate at which the environment causes\ndecoherence of an oscillator [4]. Indeed, exactly this kind of approach has been used\nvery successfully in the field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) to probe the\nquantum coherence of a mode of the electromagnetic field by examining its influence\non effectively two-level atoms [5, 6, 7]. Similar experiments have also been carried out\nsuccessfully on trapped ions with the internal electronic state of the ion playing the role\nof the two-level system and the ion's motional state the oscillator [8, 9, 10].\nThe development of relatively large and well controlled quantum coherent TLSs\nin the solid-state, such as superconducting circuits designed to act as qubits, seems to\noffer a way to perform analogous experiments with nanomechanical resonators [1, 2].\nFurthermore, recent experiments have demonstrated that it is possible to recreate many\nof the features of traditional optical cQED in the solid state using a superconducting\nqubit coupled to a superconducting resonator [11, 12]. Since nanomechanical resonators\nare typically a few microns in length and contain macroscopic numbers of atoms,\nproducing a quantum superposition of spatially separated states in such systems and\nmonitoring its progressive loss of coherence (due to interactions with its environment)\nwould represent an important increase in size of the system involved compared to\nsuperpositions of ions and light [13, 14]. However, performing quantum coherent\nexperiments using a nanomechanical resonator is likely to be more difficult than with\na superconducting one as nanomechanical resonators are generally much lower in\nfrequency.\nIn order to understand the practical difficulties entailed in using a superconducting\nqubit to probe the decoherence of a nanomechanical resonator we briefly review\nthe apparent constraints which any such scheme must satisfy. First of all, the\nsuperconducting qubit must remain sufficiently coherent that the influence of the\nmechanical resonator's environment can be clearly discerned in its dynamics. Secondly,\nit will be desirable to couple the TLS and resonator as strongly as possible since the\nsignal(s) of coherence and/or decoherence in the mechanical resonator measurable in\nthe TLS will become clearer the larger the coupling between the TLS and resonator.\nFinally, unless impressive cooling of the resonator can be achieved, the experiments will\n\n\fProbing the quantum coherence of a nanomechanical resonator: Echo scheme\n\n3\n\nalways have to contend with the competing effect of phase smearing arising from the\nrange of oscillator states (and their associated phases) in the thermal ensemble of the\noscillator. Again the relatively low frequencies of mechanical resonators make this more\nof a problem than it would be in the superconducting case. Note that in practice there\nis no simple way of designing a double clamped beam resonator to optimize all of these\nconstraints at once\u2021. For example, in most realizations the TLS-resonator coupling will\nincrease as the resonator is made larger, but enlargement of the resonator will inevitably\nreduce its fundamental frequency.\nIn this paper we describe how a dispersive interaction between a superconducting\nqubit and a nanomechanical resonator can be used to produce superpositions of the\nresonator state and how the coherence of this superposition can then be probed by\nmeasuring the state of the TLS. We identify the relatively short coherence times of the\nsuperconducting qubit as the most serious constraint on these types of scheme and hence\nassume that the TLS is tuned to operate at a point where its coherence is maximized;\nit is this choice of operating point which leads to a dispersive coupling between the\nTLS and the resonator. Although the dispersive interaction is relatively weak, we find\nthat the effect of the TLS on the resonator can be amplified by preparing the latter\nin a state with large amplitude. We explore in detail the quantum dynamics of the\nresonator and TLS including the effects of the inevitably mixed initial state of the\nresonator and the interaction with the environment. In assessing the extent to which\nthe schemes we propose can be carried out in practice we make use of the analysis in\nthe companion reference [16], which considers how sufficiently strong coupling between\na nanomechanical resonator and a superconducting qubit can be best achieved without\ndegrading the coherence of the qubit.\nOur work builds on and extends previous studies of similar systems [1, 2, 17, 3, 18].\nIn particular, we believe that the scheme outlined here represents an important\nimprovement on that proposed by us in Ref. [1] in a number of respects. Most\nimportantly, the scheme we propose here is more likely to be practicable as it is designed\nto be performed at the degeneracy point of the qubit where it remains coherent for\nat least an order of magnitude longer [19] than the operating point considered in [1].\nFurthermore, the scheme is much more flexible in the sense that it would be possible\nto vary several of the important parameters systematically (such as the phase space\nseparation of the resonator states involved and the duration of the superposition). This\nwould be an important advantage in interpreting the results of this type of experiment,\nsince the nature of the mechanical resonator's environment is not well understood [20]\nand in a sense the purpose of the experiment we propose would be to provide empirical\ninformation about it.\nThis paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we introduce the generic Hamiltonian\n\u2021 One interesting way to avoid the problems posed by the relatively low frequency of flexural-mode\nmechanical resonators is to use a different type of mechanical system, such as dilational disk resonators\nwhich can have frequencies well beyond 1 GHz [15]. Here, however, we will confine our attention to the\nconventional mechanical resonators formed by doubly clamped beams.\n\n\fProbing the quantum coherence of a nanomechanical resonator: Echo scheme\n\n4\n\nfor the superconducting qubit-resonator systems which we will work with here. We\ndiscuss the practical constraints which dictate our choice of operating regime and\nintroduce the effective (dispersive) Hamiltonian which is valid when the mechanical\nresonator is much slower than the superconducting circuit. Next in section 3 we describe\nhow the dispersive interaction can create states which involve superpositions of spatially\nseparated states of the mechanical resonator so that measurements on the TLS alone\nshow an apparent initial loss of coherence. We show that the TLS coherence can be\nrecovered (recoherence) in a controlled way using a particular choice of control pulses.\nIn section 4 we calculate how the presence of the environment of both the mechanical\nresonator and the qubit itself affects recoherence. We then consider the values of\nthe various parameters which are likely to be practicable in present or near future\nexperiments in section 5. Then in section 6, we present calculations of the behaviour of\nthe recoherences for a range of practicable parameter values. Finally, section 7 contains\na discussion of our results and our conclusions. The Appendix contains further details\non some of our calculations.\n2. Resonator-TLS Effective Hamiltonian\n2.1. Operating Regime\nThe generic Hamiltonian for the superconducting TLS and mechanical resonator which\nwe consider here is,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n\u01eb0\n\u2020\n\u2020\n(1)\nH = \u03c3z + \u2206\u03c3x + \u03bb(a + a)\u03c3z + ~\u03c9 a a +\n2\n2\n\nwhere the qubit energy scales \u01eb0 and \u2206 depend on the details of the specific\nsuperconducting system considered, \u03c9 is the resonator frequency, \u03bb is the strength of\nthe resonator-TLS coupling, and the operators \u03c3z(x) act on the TLS while a(\u2020) act on the\nresonator. The mechanical resonator is assumed to be the fundamental flexural mode of\na suspended doubly-clamped beam. The coupling between the TLS and the mechanical\nresonator is implicitly assumed to be weak in the sense that only linear (in the resonator\nposition coordinate) coupling needs to be considered. The TLS states are defined as |1i\nand |0i so that e.g. \u03c3x = |1ih0| + |0ih1|.\nThis Hamiltonian is derived in Ref. [16] for the specific cases of either a Cooper\npair box (CPB) with an island which is suspended to form the mechanical resonator, or\na flux qubit (again with suspended segment that forms the mechanical resonator). In\neach case the qubit is also assumed to be fabricated close to the centre electrode of a\nsuperconducting microwave coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator. The CPW resonator\nprovides a way to both measure and manipulate the qubit state, as well as a means\nto drive the mechanical resonator into an initial state which has a large amplitude.\nAlthough both the mechanical resonator and the qubit are also coupled to the CPW\nresonator in this system as just stated, we will not include the latter explicitly in this\narticle, assuming that it is unpopulated (i.e. it is at or close to the vacuum state), except\n\n\fProbing the quantum coherence of a nanomechanical resonator: Echo scheme\n\n5\n\ninitially when used to drive the mechanical resonator [16] and for the short periods when\nit is used to manipulate the state of the qubit. Population of the CPW resonator is\nrequired when measuring the qubit state, but at this stage disruption to the mechanical\nsystem and dephasing of the qubit are unimportant so long as the measurement can still\nbe performed with high fidelity, which we will assume is the case. For a CPB the states\n|0i, |1i correspond to different charge states and the coupling between the TLS and the\nresonator is capacitive. In contrast, when the Hamiltonian [equation (1)] is realized with\na flux qubit, the coupling between the TLS and the mechanical resonator is inductive\nand the relevant qubit states are of current circulating in opposite directions [2, 16, 21].\nThe best coherence times for both superconducting charge and flux based qubits\nare achieved at the degeneracy point where \u01eb0 = 0. Away from the degeneracy point,\nexperiments [19] have demonstrated that the coherence times of superconducting qubits\ndecrease by orders of magnitude. We regard the coherence of the superconducting TLS\nas the primary constraint and hence we choose to operate the TLS at its degeneracy\npoint when probing the resonator's coherence. Another important constraint arising\nfrom the use of the superconducting TLS is the need to avoid thermal mixing of the two\nstates involved. In practice, for experiments performed at temperatures of order 20 mK\nthis means that we will require energy separations between the two states (i.e. 2\u2206 when\nworking at the degeneracy point) in the superconducting TLS that are much larger than\nthe thermal energy scale. Experiments [22] using a CPB (coupled to a superconducting\nCPW resonator for state control and read-out) achieved coherence (T2 ) times of up to\n0.5 \u03bcs (operating at the degeneracy point) and relaxation times (T1 ) of about 7 \u03bcs with\n\u03bda = 2\u2206/h \u223c 5 GHz and we take these as indicative of the current practical limitations.\nNote that even longer coherence times of up to 2 \u03bcs have been reported for experiments\non CPBs using an echo technique in which the TLS state is inverted mid-way through\nthe experiment[23]\nIn terms of the mechanical resonator, we will consider beam structures which are\nfabricated by under-etching a bulk substrate or metallic film. The fundamental (flexural)\nmode frequencies of such devices can in practice be as high as 1 GHz [24], but because the\nelectro-mechanical coupling, \u03bb, (in equation 1) for such modes increases with the length\nof the beam, l, (for both capacitive and inductive couplings [16]) whereas the frequency\nclearly decreases with increasing l, it is clear that high frequencies can only be achieved\nat the expense of very weak couplings [16, 1, 2]. Nanomechanical resonators have\nalready been fabricated in close proximity to superconducting structures [25], but with\nmechanical frequencies \u223c 20 MHz. We therefore assume that the mechanical frequency\nwill be much lower than the energy scale of the qubit, i.e. \u2206 \u226b ~\u03c9. Having made this\nassumption of a wide separation of time-scales for the mechanical and superconducting\nelements we can proceed to derive a simpler effective Hamiltonian which is valid in this\nregime.\u00a7\n\u00a7 Note that the CPW resonator used to manipulate the CPB state will have a frequency which is close\nto \u03bda and hence is also very far from the mechanical frequency.\n\n\fProbing the quantum coherence of a nanomechanical resonator: Echo scheme\n\n6\n\n2.2. Adiabatic limit\nWhen \u01eb0 , is tuned to zero it is convenient to rewrite the Hamiltonian in terms of a new\nbasis for the qubit. Defining new basis states,\n1\n(2)\n|\u00b1i = \u221a (\u00b1|0i + |1i),\n2\nwe can write the Hamiltonian (1) for \u01eb = 0 as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u2020\n\u2020\nHdeg = \u2206\u03c3 z + \u03bb(a + a)\u03c3 x + ~\u03c9 a a +\n(3)\n2\n\nwhere the new spin operators are defined in terms of the new basis states.\nWe proceed by exploiting the separation in time-scales to make an adiabatic\napproximation [2, 26, 27, 28]. Since the mechanical resonator will generally be in a\nGaussian state of large amplitude, in what follows it is reasonable to take a semiclassical approach [26]. We initially assume that the mechanical resonator is at a fixed\nposition x and use this to calculate the eigenvalues of the TLS, these are then used to\ncalculate an effective Hamiltonian for the oscillator. With the resonator at position x\nthe Hamiltonian of the TLS is (using equation 3):\nHT LS = \u2206\u03c3 z + \u03bb(x/xzp )\u03c3 x ,\n\n(4)\np\nwhere xzp = (~/2m\u03c9)1/2 . The eigenvalues of the TLS are now \u01eb\u00b1 = \u00b1 \u22062 + (\u03bbx/xzp )2 .\nFor sufficiently weak coupling i.e. [\u03bbx/(xzp \u2206)]2 \u226a 1, we can expand the eigenvalues to\nlowest order\n\u0012\n\u00132 !\n1\n\u03bbx\n.\n(5)\n\u01eb\u00b1 = \u00b1\u2206 1 +\n2 xzp \u2206\nThe evolution of the mechanical system over time then causes a weak position dependent\n(and hence ultimately time dependent) perturbation to the eigenstates of the TLS.\nIn the adiabatic approximation the wide separation of time-scales and weak coupling\nmean that the TLS evolves smoothly within each eigenstate with its dynamics arising\nfrom changes in time of the eigenstates themselves, rather than any transitions between\ndifferent eigenstates.\nLabeling the instantaneous eigenstates of equation (4) as |+\u0303i and |\u2212\u0303i, we can write\ndown the effective Hamiltonian felt by the oscillator for the TLS confined to one of its\neigenstates as,\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03bb2 \u2020\n\u2020\n2\nH\u00b1\u0303 = ~\u03c9 a a +\n\u00b1 \u2206+\n(6)\n(a + a)\n2\n2\u2206\n\nTherefore within the framework of the adiabatic approximation we can write down the\nfollowing model Hamiltonian for the system,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n\u03bb2 \u2020\n\u2020\n2\n.\n(7)\n(a + a) \u03c3 z + ~\u03c9 a a +\nH =\u2206 1+\n2\u22062\n2\nWe have dropped the distinction between perturbed and unperturbed eigenstates as it\ndoes not play a role in what follows.\n\n\fProbing the quantum coherence of a nanomechanical resonator: Echo scheme\n\n7\n\nAssuming that the coupling term is a weak perturbation (i.e. assuming \u03bb2 /2\u2206 \u226a\n~\u03c9), we can also make the rotating wave approximation in which the terms a2 and (a\u2020 )2\nare dropped [2]. The final result of these approximations is the following dispersive\nHamiltonian for the TLS-resonator system,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n\u2020\n\u2020\n+ ~\u03c9 a a +\n(8)\nHd = \u2206\u03c3 z + ~\u03c91 \u03c3 z a a +\n2\n2\n\nwhere \u03c91 = \u03bb2 /(~\u2206). A key feature of this Hamiltonian is that the perturbation of the\noscillator commutes with the unperturbed Hamiltonian (i.e. it is a QND Hamiltonian).\nThis feature is exploited in schemes to measure the number state of a resonator using\na superconducting qubit [29, 30, 31] and it also plays an important role in what follows\nhere. Note that this Hamiltonian can also be obtained from equation (3) via a range of\nother approaches [7, 17, 32, 30, 33].\n3. Coherent oscillations and recoherences: simple description\nThe dispersive Hamiltonian shifts the mechanical frequency in a way that depends on\nthe state of the TLS. This interaction can be used to probe the quantum coherence of\nthe mechanical resonator. The idea is to perform a Ramsey interference [7] experiment\nin which the qubit is prepared in a superposition of its eigenstates states using a control\npulse, this superposition is then allowed to interact with the resonator for a time t\nbefore a second pulse is applied to the qubit and then a measurement of its state is\nperformed. For an isolated TLS the probability of finding the system in one or other\nof its eigenstates at the end of the experiment will oscillate between zero and unity as\na function of the time between the two control pulses. When the mechanical resonator\nis present the interaction with the superposition of TLS states leads to an overall\nsuperposition of states involving spatially separated mechanical states. For a sufficiently\nstrong interaction, the separation of the resonator states coupled to the qubit states leads\nto a strong suppression of the oscillations in the final qubit state measurements. The\ncoherence of the resonator can be inferred by inverting the state of the TLS midway\nbetween the two original control pulses. The scheme is illustrated schematically in figure\n1. In the absence of the resonator's environment, such an inversion should lead to a\nreversal of its dynamics and hence the recovery of the oscillations in the final TLS state\nmeasurement [6]. Very similar schemes have been demonstrated in optical systems [7].\nIn what follows, we will assume that it is possible to measure the state of the TLS\nwithin the |\u00b1i basis and to rotate its state by applying transformations of the form\nexp(\u2212i\u03b8\u03c3 x /2) with a parameter \u03b8 that can be controlled to a high degree of precision.\nThese requirements are readily met in the system of a charge or flux qubit (with\nsuspended segment forming a mechanical resonator) coupled to a superconducting CPW\nresonator described in Ref. [16], which we consider here. The TLS state is determined\nby measuring the transmission of an off-resonant pulse applied to the CPW resonator,\nwhile rotation of the TLS is performed by applying almost-resonant pulses to the CPW\nresonator and making use of the resulting Rabi oscillations [32, 22].\n\n\fProbing the quantum coherence of a nanomechanical resonator: Echo scheme\n\n8\n\nWe will begin by considering the simple though unrealistic case of an isolated\nresonator which is initially prepared in a coherent state, |\u03b10 i. The effects of the\nenvironment on the evolution of the coupled TLS-resonator device and the types of\ninitial (mixtures of) states of the oscillator that can be prepared in practice are addressed\nin later sections. We assume that the TLS system is in its ground state |\u2212i, hence the\ntotal initial state is |\u2212i \u2297 |\u03b10 i. Application of an appropriate control pulse to rotate\nthe state of the TLS by \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 produces a superposition of TLS states. Since the\nrotation of the TLS will in practice be very fast compared to the mechanical period we\ncan neglect any evolution of the mechanical resonator during the pulse and hence write\nthe total state of the system after the pulse as \u03c1(0) = |\u03c8(0)ih\u03c8(0)| with\n1\n(9)\n|\u03c8(0)i = \u221a (|\u2212i \u2212 i|+i) \u2297 |\u03b10 i,\n2\nStarting with this initial state at t = 0, the dispersive interaction [equation (8)] leads\nto the following joint state after time t,\n1\n(10)\n|\u03c8(t)i = \u221a (|\u2212i \u2297 |\u03b1\u2212 (t)i \u2212 i|+i \u2297 |\u03b1+ (t)i)\n2\nwhere\n\u2020 a+1/2)t\n\n|\u03b1\u00b1 (t)i = e\u2213i\u2206t/~e\u2212i(\u03c9\u00b1\u03c91 )(a\n\n|\u03b10 i\n\n= e\u2213i\u2206t/~e\u2212i(\u03c9\u00b1\u03c91 )t/2 |\u03b10 e\u2212i(\u03c9\u00b1\u03c91 )t i.\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nThe resonator evolution in phase space during this period is illustrated in figure 1b. The\nnext step is to perform a second \u03c0/2 rotation on the TLS, leading to the state\n1\n|\u03c8 (+) (t)i = [|\u2212i \u2297 (|\u03b1\u2212 (t)i \u2212 |\u03b1+ (t)i) \u2212 i|+i \u2297 (|\u03b1\u2212 (t)i + |\u03b1+ (t)i)] .(13)\n2\nFinally, the state of the TLS is measured in the |\u00b1i basis. The probability of finding\nthe TLS in state |+i for a period of evolution t between the two control pulses is\n1\nP|+i (t) = Tr[|+ih+|\u03c1(t)] = (1 + Re[h\u03b1\u2212 (t)|\u03b1+ (t)i]) .\n(14)\n2\nThe overlap is readily evaluated,\n\u22122i\u03c91 t\n2\n) e\u22122i\u2206t/~\u2212i\u03c91 t .\n(15)\nh\u03b1 (t)|\u03b1 (t)i = e\u2212|\u03b10 | (1\u2212e\n\u2212\n\n+\n\nThe final result for P|+i (t) is thus,\ni\n1 1 h\n\u22122i\u03c91 t\n2\n) e\u22122i\u2206t/~\u2212i\u03c91 t .\nP|+i (t) = + Re e\u2212|\u03b10 | (1\u2212e\n(16)\n2 2\nNote that this function depends only on the amplitude of the initial mechanical state,\nnot its phase.\nThe behaviour of P|+i (t) is easy to understand. Without any coupling to the\nresonator the coherent oscillations in the TLS state mean that the probability oscillates\nover time between zero and unity with a period \u03c4R = h/(2\u2206)k a key indicator of the\nk Note that in practice the pulses used to rotate the state of the TLS are chosen to be slightly offresonant. As a result a stroboscopic observation of the oscillations in P|+i can be made which replaces\nthe very fast oscillations at frequency 2\u2206/~ with much slower (and hence easier to observe) ones at the\nchosen de-tuning frequency [7, 34, 22], we neglect this detail here as our primary interest is not in the\nfrequency of the oscillations but in their amplitude.\n\n\fProbing the quantum coherence of a nanomechanical resonator: Echo scheme\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nX2\n1/2\n\nX2\n\n9\n\n\u2212\u03c91\n\nS(t)\nX1\n\nX1\n+\u03c91\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nX2\n\nX2\n\n+\u03c91\n\u2212\u03c91\n\nX1\n\nX1\n\nFigure 1. Schematic illustration of the evolution of the mechanical resonator in phase\nspace during the echo sequence. Initially (a) the resonator is prepared in a coherent\nstate and the qubit is prepared in a superposition of states. The two qubit states\ncouple to the resonator leading to different effective frequencies \u03c9 \u00b1 \u03c91 so that in the\nframe rotating at the resonator frequency the two mechanical states start to pull apart\n(b). A \u03c0 pulse inverts the qubit state and hence interchanges the relative frequencies\nof the two resonator states (c). When the periods of evolution before and after the\ninversion of the qubit are the same the resonator will return to its initial state (d) in\nthe absence of dissipation.\n\nquantum coherence of the TLS [22]. For sufficiently strong coupling, the resonator causes\na relatively rapid reduction in the amplitude of the oscillations as a function of time\nleading to a period where P|+i (t) = 0.5, implying that the resonator decoheres the\nTLS. However, because the resonator is a periodic system and is itself coherent, the\noscillations in P|+i (t) reappear, giving rise to so-called recoherence, for t \u223c \u03c0/\u03c91 [2].\nAlthough recoherence does occur naturally after a time t \u223c \u03c0/\u03c91 it is preferable to\nuse an approach where the time between coherences can be varied systematically. This\nis readily achieved using a spin echo technique to induce recoherence at a chosen time.\nThis type of approach was used with great success in optical cQED experiments [6] as\nwell as experiments on superconducting circuits [12, 23].\n3.1. Echo technique\nFor the spin echo sequence we again start with the system in the state |\u03c8(0)i (equation\n9) and allow it to evolve as before for a time t1 so that,\n1\n(17)\n|\u03c8(t1 )i = \u221a (|\u2212i \u2297 |\u03b1\u2212 (t1 )i \u2212 i|+i \u2297 |\u03b1+ (t1 )i) .\n2\nNext we apply a control pulse to the TLS which effectively inverts the populations of the\ntwo eigenstates [this corresponds to the unitary operation exp(\u2212i\u03b8\u03c3 x /2) with \u03b8 = \u03c0].\n\n\fProbing the quantum coherence of a nanomechanical resonator: Echo scheme\n\n10\n\nThus, just after the pulse we have\n\u22121\n(18)\n|\u03c8(t+\n1 )i = \u221a (i|+i \u2297 |\u03b1\u2212 (t1 )i + |\u2212i \u2297 |\u03b1+ (t1 )i) .\n2\nWe now allow the system to evolve for a further time t2 , after which the resulting state\nof the system will be\n\u22121\n(19)\n|\u03c8(t1 + t2 )i = \u221a (|\u2212i \u2297 |\u03b1\u2212+ (t2 , t1 )i + i|+i \u2297 |\u03b1+\u2212 (t2 , t1 )i) .\n2\nwhere now,\n\u2020 a+1/2)t\n2\n\n|\u03b1\u2212+ (t2 , t1 )i = e\u2212i\u2206(t1 \u2212t2 )/~e\u2212i(\u03c9\u2212\u03c91 )(a\n\n\u2020 a+1/2)t\n1\n\ne\u2212i(\u03c9+\u03c91 )(a\n\ni\u2206(t1 \u2212t2 )/~ \u2212i(\u03c9+\u03c91 )(a\u2020 a+1/2)t2 \u2212i(\u03c9\u2212\u03c91 )(a\u2020 a+1/2)t1\n\n|\u03b1+\u2212 (t2 , t1 )i = e\n\ne\n\ne\n\n|\u03b10 i\n\n|\u03b10 i.\n\n(20)\n(21)\n\nNote that the simplicity of this expression relies on the fact that the perturbed resonator\nHamiltonian commutes with the unperturbed one\u00b6, thus we find\n\u2020 a+1/2)(t \u2212t )\n1\n2\n\nh\u03b1\u2212+ (t2 , t1 )|\u03b1+\u2212 (t2 , t1 )i = e2i\u2206(t1 \u2212t2 )/~h\u03b10 |ei2\u03c91 (a\n\n|\u03b10 i.\n\n(22)\n\nCarrying out a final rotation of the TLS state (with \u03b8 = \u03c0/2) the final overall probability\nof finding it in state |+i is given by\ni\n1 1 h\n2i\u03c91 (t1 \u2212t2 )\n2\n) e2i\u2206(t1 \u2212t2 )/~+i\u03c91 (t1 \u2212t2 ) .

We note that this particular approach also has\nthe advantage that inverting the state of the TLS at t = t1 can lead to an increase in\nthe effective coherence of the TLS as measured at t2 \u2243 t1 as it eliminates dephasing\neffects arising from fluctuations in the TLS energy level spacings which occur between\ndifferent experimental runs [23].\nE[P|+i (t1 + t2 )] =\n\n3.2. State separation and entanglement\nAfter evolving for a time t (and without any inversion of the TLS states), the two\ncoherent states of the resonator that (together with the TLS states) form a superposition\n\u00b6 Note, however, that with an appropriate choice of control pulse at t = t1 the idea of an echo\nexperiment is not limited to systems with dispersive Hamiltonians. This type of experiment has been\nperformed for systems with a Jaynes-Cummings type interaction [6].\n\n\fProbing the quantum coherence of a nanomechanical resonator: Echo scheme\nare |\u03b1\u00b1 (t)i [equation (12)] and they have a separation in phase space given by\n\u0002\n\u00031/2\nS(t) = (hX1 i\u03b1+ \u2212 hX1 i\u03b1\u2212 )2 + (hX2 i\u03b1+ \u2212 hX2 i\u03b1\u2212 )2\n= 2|\u03b10 | sin \u03c91 t\n\n11\n\n(26)\n(27)\n\nwhere hX1 i\u03b1+ = h\u03b1+ |X1 |\u03b1+ i etc, and the phase space operators are defined by\nX1 = (a + a\u2020 )/2 and X2 = (a \u2212 a\u2020 )/(2i). Because we are dealing with a pure state\nof the TLS and resonator we can also obtain the entanglement of the system, E(t),\nby calculating the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix (of either the\nresonator or the TLS)+ . Evaluating this we find that it is entirely determined by the\nphase space separation of the resonator states [13],\n\u0002\n\u0003\nE(t) = 1 \u2212 log2 (1 + \u03c7)(1+\u03c7)/2 (1 \u2212 \u03c7)(1\u2212\u03c7)/2\n(28)\n\nwhere \u03c7(t) = exp(\u2212S(t)2 /2). The entanglement E(t) rapidly saturates at its maximum\nvalue of unity as the separation S is increased: it reaches about 0.75 for S = 1 and is\nalready very close to unity for S = 2. Note that the decay of the qubit oscillations also\ndepends on S alone: we can rewrite equation (16) as,\n1\n(29)\nP|+i (t) = (1 + \u03c7(t) cos \u03c6(t))\n2\nwhere the (real) phase is defined as \u03c6(t) = (2\u2206/~ + \u03c91 )t + |\u03b10 |2 sin(2\u03c91 t).\nThe aim of these simple calculations is just to show that the separation of the\nresonator states in phase space provides an important figure of merit for the kind of\nexperiment we have in mind. The diameter of the 'uncertainty circle' [33] for a coherent\nstate is 1/2 and so one basic (though somewhat arbitrary) criterion for producing a\ndistinguishable superposition of resonator states is to require S(t) & 1. Although\naccording to equation (27) the largest separation is achieved when \u03c91 t = \u03c0/2, in practice\nthe limited coherence times available for the TLS mean that the evolution times will\nbe such that \u03c91 t \u226a 1 and hence we can approximate S(t) \u2243 2|\u03b10 |\u03c91 t. If we use the\nspin echo approach then the maximum separation will be achieved at t = t1 just before\nthe TLS state is inverted and hence to achieve a meaningful superposition we would\nneed to have 2|\u03b10 |\u03c91 t1 & 1. The details of how a driven resonator state could be\nprepared in practice for the qubit-mechanical resonator system in which the mechanical\ncomponent is formed by suspending part of the qubit circuit is considered in reference\n[16]; we will make use of the results obtained there when considering what kind of initial\nmechanical state could be prepared in practice, but for now we point out the crucial\nrole played by the magnitude of the initial coherent state, |\u03b10 |. The size of resonator\nstate superposition produced depends through \u03b10 on the initial state of the oscillator.\nThis provides us with a way of overcoming the weak TLS-resonator coupling and the\nwide separation of their time scales: by preparing the resonator in a state with large\nenough |\u03b10 | we can overcome the very weak interaction with the qubit to nevertheless\nproduce relatively large superpositions over the relatively short times during which the\nTLS remains coherent. On the other hand, unless we start with a state with non-zero\n\u03b10 then S will be zero throughout (and no entanglement will be produced).\n+\n\nNote that the entanglement dynamics of this system was studied very recently for mixed states [35]\n\n\fProbing the quantum coherence of a nanomechanical resonator: Echo scheme\n\n12\n\n4. Role of the resonator's environment\nWe now consider the effect which the resonator's environment has on the recoherences\nin the qubit. The interaction between the resonator and its surroundings is typically\nmodelled by including a bath of oscillators that are weakly coupled to the resonator.\nThis approach is the one followed in quantum optics and although it is not clear to\nwhat extent it represents an actual nanomechanical resonator's environment [20], it can\nat least be justified in the idealised case where dissipation in the collective mechanical\nmode which forms the resonator is due only to coupling to the bulk phonon modes in\nthe supports of the resonator [36]. In this simplified description the effects of the bath\non the 'system' resonator can parameterized by a damping rate \u03b3 for the resonator and\na temperature Tr , which can be expressed in terms of the average number of the quanta\nthe resonator would have if it were in equilibrium with the bath,\n1\n.\n(30)\nn = ~\u03c9/kTr\n\u22121\ne\nFor sufficiently high temperatures (kB Tr \u226b ~\u03b3) the master equation for the mechanical\nresonator and qubit including the dissipative effects of the resonator's environment can\nbe modelled using the quantum optical damping kernel [37],\ni\n\u03c1\u0307 = L\u03c1 = \u2212 [Hd , \u03c1] + Ld \u03c1\n(31)\n~\nwhere\n\u03b3\nm\u03c9\u03b3(n + 1/2)\nLd \u03c1 = \u2212i [x, {p, \u03c1}] \u2212\n[x, [x, \u03c1]].\n(32)\n2~\n~\nAssuming that the oscillator damping is very weak (\u03b3 \u226a \u03c9) we can further simply the\ndissipative part of the master equation by using the rotating wave approximation,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03b3\nLd \u03c1 = \u2212 a\u2020 a\u03c1 + \u03c1a\u2020 a \u2212 2a\u03c1a\u2020 \u2212 \u03b3n a\u2020 a\u03c1 + \u03c1aa\u2020 \u2212 a\u03c1a\u2020 \u2212 a\u2020 \u03c1a . (33)\n2\nWe stress again that we use this damping kernel here to provide a simple illustrative\nestimate of the dissipative dynamics of the mechanical resonator. The true form of the\nmechanical damping kernel remains somewhat uncertain and one of the aims of the\nexperiments we propose would be to obtain empirical information about it.\nThe superconducting qubit is also subject to decoherence due to interactions with\nother degrees of freedom in the system apart from the mechanical resonator [19]. The\ndissipative dynamics of such systems can be characterised by the relaxation times in the\nequations of motion for the diagonal and off-diagonal components of the TLS density\noperator. The decay of the excited state population of the TLS is described by T1 , while\nthe decay of the TLS coherence is described by T2 . In practice, T1 times have been\ntypically an order of magnitude larger than T2 times [22]. Since we will only consider\ntotal evolution times t (before measurement) of the system that are shorter than T2 , we\ntherefore will always have t \u226a T1 and hence can neglect relaxation of the TLS in what\nfollows.

We have chosen to specify a temperature Ti for the initial\nstate of the mechanics resonator which can be different from that of the environment\nTr . Simply driving the resonator (assuming a noiseless drive) would ideally lead to a\ndisplaced thermal state with Ti = Tr . However, it is interesting conceptually to consider\nthe case where the mechanical resonator is somehow pre-cooled to a lower temperature\nthan its surroundings Ti < Tr . Alternatively a choice of Ti > Tr provides a simple model\nfor the case where there is no cooling and instead the drive adds noise to the resonator\nstate. Although the initial resonator state will be prepared by driving, we assume that\nthe drive is switched off before the first pulse is applied to the TLS.\nThe evolution of the component equations (34)-(36) can be calculated very\nconveniently using a phase space approach [39, 40, 29, 30, 41]. The method involves\nworking with the Wigner transform of the components defined as\nZ +\u221e\n1\ndyhx + y|\u03c1+\u2212 (t)|x \u2212 yie\u22122ipy/~\n(41)\nW+\u2212 (x, p; t) =\n~\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\netc, which evolve according to the set of (uncoupled) partial differential equations\nobtained by transforming equations (34)-(36). For our choice of an initial displaced\nthermal state, each of the initial Wigner functions is Gaussian and remains so during\nthe evolution. This means that the relevant partial differential equations for the Wigner\nfunction components can be solved via a Gaussian ansatz. Details of the calculation\n(which follows the approach used in reference [30]) are given in the Appendix.\n\n\fProbing the quantum coherence of a nanomechanical resonator: Echo scheme\n\n14\n\nUsing the phase space approach, we readily obtain the following expression for\nP|+i (t),\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1 1\n(42)\nP|+i (t) = + e\u2212t/T2 Re e\u2212i2\u2206t/~+i\u03b8(t) ,\n2 2\nwhere\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\u2212M\n(43)\n\u03b8(t) = \u2212 (i\u03b3/2 + \u03c91 \u03b2) t \u2212 i ln\n1 \u2212 Me\u22122i\u03c91 \u03b2t\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0001\n|\u03b102 | \u2212i2\u03c91 \u03b2t\n1\u2212M\n\u2212i\ne\n\u22121\n\u03b2\n1 \u2212 Me\u22122i\u03c91 \u03b2t\nwith\n\u00011/2\n(44)\n\u03b2 = [1 \u2212 i\u03b3/2\u03c91 ]2 \u2212 2i\u03b3n/\u03c91\n(2m + 1) \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 i\u03b3/2\u03c91\nM=\n.\n(45)\n(2m + 1) + \u03b2 \u2212 i\u03b3/2\u03c91\nNote that in the limit \u03b3 \u2192 0 we recover the much simpler expression [2]\n#\n\"\n\u2212\u03b7(t)|\u03b10 |2 /(1+m\u03b7(t)) \u2212i(2\u2206/~+\u03c91 )t\ne\n1\ne\n1\n(th)\n,\nP|+i (t) = + e\u2212t/T2 Re\n2 2\n1 + m\u03b7(t)\n\n(46)\n\nwith \u03b7(t) = 1 \u2212 e\u22122i\u03c91 t .\n4.1. Echo sequence\nWe now consider the case where an additional \u03c0 pulse is applied to the system at\ntime t = t1 after the first \u03c0/2 pulse, and then the final \u03c0/2 pulse is applied at time\nt = tf = t1 + t2 . The evolution of the density matrix between the two \u03c0/2 pulses can\nbe written as [42, 6]\n\u03c1(tf ) = eL(tf \u2212t1 ) ReLt1 \u03c1(0),\n\n(47)\n\nR\u03c1 = e\u2212i\u03c0\u03c3x /2 \u03c1ei\u03c0\u03c3 x /2 .\n\n(48)\n\nwhere\n\nIn order to calculate P|+i (tf ) we need the off-diagonal component of the density matrix\ngiven by,\n\u03c1+\u2212 (tf ) = eL+\u2212 t2 \u03c1\u2212+ (t1 ) = eL+\u2212 t2 \u03c1\u2020+\u2212 (t1 ).\n\n(49)\n\nThis evolution can again be calculated using a phase space approach (see the Appendix\nfor details).

It is important to note that even though the system is damped, the phase\nspace separation between the components of the mechanical resonator's density matrix\ncorresponding to the diagonal elements of the TLS still vanishes at t = t1 +t2 for t2 = t1 .\n\n\fProbing the quantum coherence of a nanomechanical resonator: Echo scheme\n\n15\n\nThe use of an echo technique allows us to filter out many of the effects that arise\njust because we start with a mixed state such as a decay in the oscillation amplitude\ndue to averaging over the different phases of oscillation associated with the different\nresonator states in the initial mixture. The recoherence 'signal' measured at the echo\ntime t = 2t1 is the irreversibility of the system's dynamics [42]. What we are in effect\nmeasuring is the dynamics due to the resonator's damping kernel. There is no simple\nway of partitioning the dissipation into a contribution from the decoherence of spatially\nseparated states and simple fluctuations in the resonator's energy during the experiment:\nboth contribute to what is measured. An important consequence of this is that a perfect\nrecoherence is not achieved for \u03b3 6= 0 even if \u03b10 = 0. However, when relatively large\nphase space separations of the resonator state are achieved (S \u2265 1) and the experiment\nis performed on a time-scale which is very short compared to the energy relaxation time\n1/\u03b3, we can expect the decoherence of the superposition of mechanical states to be the\ndominant contribution to the irreversibility of the dynamics.\n5. Practical considerations\nWe now turn to the question of what kinds of parameters might be achievable in practice\nand hence the prospects for using the approach we have been discussing to probe the\nquantum coherence of a nanomechanical resonator in the near future. A key quantity\nwhich we need to examine is the maximum phase space separation, S(t1 ), between\nresonator states that can be achieved at the mid-point of an echo experiment. As we\nhave seen, a large initial amplitude for the resonator |\u03b10 | will enhance the phase space\nseparation. However, for our theoretical approach to be valid we need to ensure not\njust that the parameters are achievable in practice, but also that the approximations\nwe made in deriving the dispersive Hamiltonian [equation (8)] remain valid.\nThe basic assumptions underlying our description are that the energy scales of the\nTLS and the resonator and the mechanical system are widely separated, ~\u03c9/\u2206 \u226a 1\nand that we can only expect to achieve rather weak electro-mechanical coupling,\n\u03ba = \u03bb/~\u03c9 \u226a 1. Furthermore, we assume that the coherence time of the TLS in\nthe absence of the resonator, T2 , is of order 0.5 \u03bcs, in line with recent experimental\nresults [22, 23] for a Cooper-pair box embedded in a superconducting cavity. In line with\nthis value, we assume a maximum value of t1 for the echo experiment of \u03c4c \u2243 0.2 \u03bcs.\nFor concreteness we assume a TLS energy separation 2\u2206/h = 5 GHz and a mechanical\nfrequency \u03c9/2\u03c0 = 50 MHz.\nWithin the regime where \u03c9 \u226a \u2206/~ the maximum amplitude of the mechanical\nmotion for which the dispersive Hamiltonian remains valid is set by the condition\n(\u03bbx/xzp \u2206)2 \u226a 1, which we can express as \u03b4 = (2\u03ba|\u03b10 |~\u03c9/\u2206)2 \u226a 1. We note in passing\nthat if |\u03b10 | is small enough to satisfy this condition then in practice it will also be\nsmall enough to ensure that non-linear effects are unimportant in the dynamics of the\nmechanical resonator [43].\nThe value of the electro-mechanical coupling constant, \u03ba, which can be achieved of\n\n\fProbing the quantum coherence of a nanomechanical resonator: Echo scheme\n\n16\n\ncourse depends on the actual system used in an experiment. For the specific system we\nhave considered here consisting of a mechanical resonator formed by suspending part\nof the qubit circuit [16], the beam is assumed to have a width and thickness \u2243 200 nm\nand will need to have a length of a few microns in order to have a frequency of 50 MHz.\nFor such a beam xzp \u223c 10\u221214 m and hence we estimate [16] that coupling strengths up\nto \u03ba \u2243 0.2 should be achievable.\nThe phase space separation which is achieved after a time \u03c4c is S(\u03c4c ) \u2243 2|\u03b10 |\u03c91 \u03c4c\n(neglecting damping of the mechanical resonator). Using the constraint on the\nmagnitude of |\u03b10 |, we obtain Smax \u2243 2\u03c0\u03b4 1/2 \u03ba(\u03bdm \u03c4c ). Assuming (somewhat arbitrarily) a\nvalue of \u03b4 = 0.04, we find that the maximum value of \u03b10 that can be achieved without\nviolating our assumptions will be \u2243 5/\u03ba. Thus for \u03c4c = 0.2 \u03bcs and \u03ba = 0.2, we find\nthat the maximum value of \u03b10 is 25 and Smax = 2.5. This value for the phase space\nseparation is encouragingly large, as the minimum uncertainty in phase space of an\noscillator state with n = 10 (which corresponds to a temperature of about 25 mK for a\nmechanical frequency of 50 MHz) is 2.3.\n6. Results\nWe now use the results of the previous section to explore the behaviour of the oscillations\nin P|+i during an echo experiment using practicable values of all the parameters. We\nstart by examining the envelope of the oscillations in P|+i during an echo experiment\nbefore and after an inversion pulse at t = t1 . The envelope of the oscillations is defined\nby\n1 1\n(51)\nE[P|+i (t)] = + e\u2212t/T2 e\u2212Im[\u03b8(t)] .\n2 2\nwhere \u03b8(t) is given by equation (42) for times t < t1 and by equation (A.36) for t > t1 .\nAn example of the expected behaviour as a function of t is shown in figure 2. We assume\nthroughout the parameter values discussed in the previous section (\u03c9/2\u03c0 = 50 MHz,\n\u03bda = 5 GHz and T2 = 0.5 \u03bcs) and consider the maximal coupling \u03ba = 0.2 and amplitude\n\u03b10 = 25. The strength of the mechanical dissipation is specified by the resonator's\nQ-factor, Q = \u03c9/\u03b3. We have taken n = 10 and as well as considering the case where\nm = n, we also (for theoretical interest) consider the extreme case where the resonator\nis somehow pre-cooled to its ground state, m = 0.\nFrom the curves in figure 2 we can see that the mechanical resonator is likely to\nhave a strong effect on the TLS. It is interesting to compare the curves with and without\nthe inclusion of a finite Q-factor for the mechanical resonator. In an echo experiment,\nonly mechanical dissipation leads to a deviation from the uncoupled value of E[P|+i ] at\nthe echo point, t = 2t1 (i.e., the recoherence). Although an initial mixture of resonator\nstates leads to an average over phases associated with each of the different states and\nhence a strong enhancement of the apparent dephasing of the TLS during the first part\nof the experiment (t \u2264 t1 ), after the echo each of these phases unwinds and hence they\n\n\fProbing the quantum coherence of a nanomechanical resonator: Echo scheme\n\n17\n\n1\n\n|+\u3009\n\nE[P ]\n\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\nt/\u03bcs\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nFigure 2.

The black curve is the result that would be obtained without any coupling\nto the mechanical resonator.\n\ndo not affect the behaviour at t = 2t1 . On the other hand, when dissipation is included\nwe see that the echo signal can be substantially reduced.\nIt is important to note that dissipation of the mechanical resonator has only a\nvery small effect on the behaviour of the signal E[P|+i ] before the \u03c0 pulse is applied.\nThis is because the decay of this signal is dominated by the separation of the resonator\nstates and the averaging over the different phases associated with each of the states\nin the thermal mixture. The decoherence of the mechanical resonator only starts to\noccur once a superposition has been produced and by the time it has started to develop,\nthe value of E[P|+i ] is already close to 0.5. Thus, the decoherence of the mechanical\nresonator can only really be measured by using the echo signal around t \u2243 2t1 .\nIt is interesting to note that pre-cooling the resonator does not affect the echo\nsignal by very much. This is again because the phase averaging that occurs for a\nmixed state is largely removed by the use of the echo sequence. However, in the\npresence of dissipation the states involved in a thermal mixture will have slightly different\namplitudes (compared to the average \u03b10 ) and hence will all be affected slightly differently\nby the coupling to the environment during the evolution: the mixed initial state curve\n(m = n) does not exactly match the pre-cooled (pure) one (m = 0) at t = 2t1 . This\nbehaviour can be seen more clearly in figure 3 which focusses on the echo signal at t = 2t1\nfor a range of \u03b10 values. Over the relatively short time of the echo t1 \u226a 1/\u03b3 = Q/\u03c9,\nenergy diffusion is a very weak effect and hence the evolution of the thermal state is very\nsimilar to an average over pure initial states with a range of \u03b10 values (\u223c m1/2 ). Thus\nthe results for the initially mixed (m = n) and pure states (m = 0) become very close\nfor larger \u03b10 values where the variation of the envelope signal with \u03b10 is approximately\nlinear (on a scale \u223c m1/2 ), and overall the curves are closer for lower n.\n\n\fProbing the quantum coherence of a nanomechanical resonator: Echo scheme\n\n18\n\n1\n\nE[P (t =2t )]\n\n0.72\n\n|+\u3009 f\n\n0.69\n\n0.66\n\n0.63\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n\u03b1\n\n20\n\n25\n\n0\n\nFigure 3.

An important part of any experiment would be\nto test this behaviour, something which could readily be done for \u03b10 by simply varying\nthe initial drive applied to the mechanical resonator to prepare it in states of different\namplitude.\n\n\fProbing the quantum coherence of a nanomechanical resonator: Echo scheme\n\n19\n\n1\n\n|+\u3009\n\n1\n\nE[P (t=2t )]\n\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\nt =2t /\u03bcs\nf\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n1\n\nFigure 5.

The black line is the result that would\nbe obtained without any dissipation to the mechanical resonator.\n\nFinally, in figure 5 we explore how changing the time between the pulses t1 (and\nhence the total time for the echo experiment tf = 2t1 ) affects the behaviour at the\necho point. This plot shows clearly the strong deviation from simple exponential decay\nthat the coupling to the resonator can lead to. As we have already discussed, the\nsuperposition of resonator states takes time to develop and hence it takes a while before\ndecoherence of the mechanical resonator can start to affect the dynamics of the TLS\nwhich is measured; all the curves in figure 5 initially lie very close to each other. However,\nat longer times the dissipative effect of the mechanical system's environment starts to\nhave an important influence. Furthermore, it is clear that for strong enough coupling\nthe decay of E[P|+i (t = 2t1 )] occurs on a much faster scale than the relaxation of the\nresonator's energy, \u03b3 = \u03c9/Q, a clear sign that it is the loss of the mechanical system's\nquantum coherence which drives the process.\nThe range of Q factors which we have used here, 103 \u2212 104 , is appropriate for a\nresonator formed by a suspended metal film [44]. However, where the resonator consists\nof a semiconductor beam which is then coated in a metal layer, somewhat higher Qfactors can occur [25] (up to \u223c 105 ). For very high Q-factor resonators the amplitude\nof the echo signal will be completely dominated by the qubit decoherence and the\ncontribution from the resonator's bath may eventually become too small to measure\nin practice. In this regime the measurement of the qubit recoherences would only allow\nan upper bound for the decoherence of the mechanical system to be established.\n7. Conclusions and Discussion\nIn this paper we have discussed how a superconducting qubit can be used to probe\nthe quantum coherence of a nanomechanical resonator using methods very similar to\n\n\fProbing the quantum coherence of a nanomechanical resonator: Echo scheme\n\n20\n\nthose applied in recent optical cQED experiments. In particular, we explored how an\necho experiment could be used to systematically explore the quantum dynamics of a\nmechanical resonator using a superconducting qubit tuned to the degeneracy point as a\nprobe.\nThe advantages of the echo approach go beyond the practicalities of the system.\nThe ability to control the duration of the experiment and to vary the separation of\nresonator states produced (by varying the initial amplitude \u03b10 ) will make it much easier\nto draw strong conclusions about the nature of the mechanical system's environment.\nInterestingly, we found that over a range of temperatures (corresponding to thermal\noccupation numbers of the resonator up to \u223c 20) the recoherences were likely to be\naffected only very weakly by the variance of the initial resonator state implying that it\nis by no means necessary to prepare the resonator in a pure state to obtain important\ninformation about its quantum dynamics. We expect the echo technique to be rather\nrobust in the sense that it should give useful information about the quantum coherence of\nthe resonator for a rather wide range of parameters. The larger the separation of states\nachieved during an echo experiment, the more the magnitude of the recoherences will\ntell us about the coherence properties of the mechanical system. However, there is no\nthreshold below which nothing is learnt: even if only a very small separation (S \u2264 1) is\nachieved then some information is nevertheless obtained about the dissipative dynamics\nof the mechanical resonator beyond just the energy relaxation rate.\nSince a great deal will be inferred from the deviations between the measured\ndynamics and the reversible dynamics calculated using the dispersive Hamiltonian, it\nwill in practice be necessary to be able to discriminate between contributions arising\nfrom the resonator's environment and those due to the inevitable corrections to the\nmodel Hamiltonian which is an approximate form. Therefore, an important future\nextension of the current work would be to carry out a systematic numerical study of the\ncoupled qubit-resonator dynamics using the full Hamiltonian of the system. Such an\napproach would not just allow us to calculate the effects of corrections to the dispersive\nHamiltonian, but also allow a more comprehensive modelling of the qubit's environment\nto include energy relaxation. As recent experiments [23] have begun to approach the\nregime where T2 > T1 , the inclusion of a finite T1 is becoming increasingly relevant.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank E. Buks and G.
