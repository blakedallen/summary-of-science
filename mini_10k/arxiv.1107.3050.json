When constructing a geometry over a ring, a majority of authors consider as\npoints of such a geometry only free cyclic submodules (FCSs) generated by unimodular\nvectors [5], whilst some authors consider all cyclic submodules [6, 7]. It has recently been\nshown [9] that there exists rings for which some vectors of the submodule are not contained\nin an FCS generated by a unimodular vector. These vectors have been called outliers.\nEven more interesting is that some outliers themselves generate FCSs. A geometry may be\nconstructed using all FCSs.\nAnalysing all finite associative rings with unity up to order 31 inclusive, only several\nrings are found to feature outliers. Out of these, only few non-commutative rings exhibit\nFCSs comprising solely non-unimodular vectors [8]; the smallest example being the ring of\nternions over the Galois field of order two [9]. These examples motivated a more systematic\nand general treatment of the questions of the existence of outliers and FCSs generated by\nthem. The outcomes of our explorations are not only interesting on their own, but they can\nalso have interesting physical bearings (like, e. g., those proposed in [10]).\n\n2\n\nDefinitions and Preliminaries\n\nAll rings considered are finite, associative and with unity (multiplicative identity). It is well\nknown that in such a ring, R, an element is either a unit or a (two-sided) zero-divisor (see,\nfor example, [11, \u00a72.1]); in what follows the group of units of R is denoted by R\u2217 and the\nset of zero divisors by R \\ R\u2217 . 1 is the unity element of R and the symbol \u2282 stands for strict\ninclusion.\n1\n\n\fDefinition 1. Let hR, *, +i be a ring. A left ideal, Il , is a subgroup of hR, +i such that\nrx \u2208 Il for all r \u2208 R and x \u2208 Il . A right ideal, Ir , is a subgroup of hR, +i such that xr \u2208 Ir\nfor all x \u2208 Ir and r \u2208 R. An ideal is principal if it is generated by a single element of R.\nFor a \u2208 R the principal left ideal generated by a is Ra, and a principal right ideal generated\nby a is aR.\nFor further background on rings see, for example, [12].\nDefinition 2. [5, Defi 2.9][13, p. 16] Let S \u2286 R. The left (right) annihilator of S, denoted\nS (S \u22a5 ), is defined as:\n\n\u22a5\n\n\u22a5\n\nS\nS\u22a5\n\n= {x \u2208 R : xa = 0, \u2200a \u2208 S},\n= {x \u2208 R : ax = 0, \u2200a \u2208 S}.\n\nFor sets containing a single element, the notation is simplified \u22a5{a} :=\n\n\u22a5\n\na.\n\nLemma 3. Let P, S \u2286 R, then \u22a5S is a left ideal, S \u22a5 is a right ideal and\n\u22a5\n\nP\u2229\n\n\u22a5\n\nS=\n\n\u22a5\n\n(P \u222a S).\n\nDefinitions below are given for left modules, the mirrored definitions can be given for\nright modules.\nDefinition 4. [5] Let R be a ring with unity, and 2R be a left module over R, and let\naR + bR = {ax + by : x, y \u2208 R}.\n\n(1)\n\n(a, b) \u2208 2R is unimodular if aR + bR = R.\nNote that aR and bR are principal right ideals of R. The following Lemma provides an\nalternate definition of unimodular.\nLemma 5. [5] Let R be a ring with unity, and 2R be a left module over R. (a, b) \u2208 2R is\nunimodular if and only if there exists x, y \u2208 R such that ax + by = 1.\nDefinition 6. R(a, b) is a cyclic subset of 2R generated by (a, b):\nR(a, b) = {(\u03b1a, \u03b1b) : \u03b1 \u2208 R}.\nIf (\u03b1a, \u03b1b) = (0, 0) only when \u03b1 = 0, then R(a, b) is a free cyclic submodule.\nReworking the definition of a free cyclic submodule using annihilators leads to the obvious\nlemma:\nLemma 7. Let R be a finite associative ring with unity. R(a, b) is a free cyclic submodule\nof 2R if and only if\n\u22a5\na \u2229 \u22a5 b = {0}.\n(2)\nProof. Let (a, b) be the generating vector, then by definition R(a, b) is free if \u03b1(a, b) = (0, 0)\nonly if \u03b1 = 0. This is equivalent to equation (2).\nLemma 8. [5, \u00a71] Let (a, b) be a unimodular vector in 2R, then R(a, b) is a free cyclic\nsubmodule.\nUnimodular vectors have other useful properties [5], and for many rings all free cyclic\nsubmodules are generated by unimodular vectors. However this is not always the case.\nCorollaries 21 and 24 show two classes of rings for which all free cyclic submodules are\ngenerated by unimodular vectors. The ring of ternions [9] is an example where some free\ncyclic submodules are generated by non-unimodular vectors.\n2\n\n\fDefinition 9. An outlier is a vector which is not contained in any free cyclic submodule\ngenerated by a unimodular vector.\nThe aim of this research is to get some insight into which rings contain outliers, and,\nmore specifically, which rings contain outliers that generate free cyclic submodules. This\nquestion is of interest for general nR, but we only treat the simplified case of 2R where R is\na finite associative ring.\n\n3\n\nResults\n\n3.1\n\nUnimodular vectors\n\nWe begin by collecting some important facts about unimodular vectors.\nIf a \u2208 R\u2217 , then aR = R, hence for all b \u2208 R, aR + bR = R. Thus any vector containing a\nunit as an entry is a unimodular vector. Unimodular vectors may be divided into two types:\n\u2022 Type I: vectors which contain at least one entry which is a unit;\n\u2022 Type II: vectors which contain no entries that are units.\nTheorem 10. Let R be a finite associative ring with unity. If a, b \u2208 R \\ R\u2217 , then (a, b) is\na unimodular vector in 2R if and only if there exist maximal right ideals, I1 , I2 , such that\na \u2208 I1 \\ I2 and b \u2208 I2 \\ I1 .\nProof. \u21d2 Assume (a, b) is unimodular. Since a, b \u2208 R \\ R\u2217 , aR and bR are right ideals\nstrictly contained in R. If there is some proper right ideal, I, that contains a and b, then\naR + bR \u2286 I \u2282 R. Hence, if (a, b) is unimodular, then a and b cannot be contained in the\nsame maximal ideal.\n\u21d0 Assume a \u2208 I1 \\ I2 and b \u2208 I2 \\ I1 , then aR and bR are right ideals for which aR \u2282 I1\nand bR \u2282 I2 . aR+bR is a right ideal not contained in either I1 or I2 . Therefore aR+bR must\nbe contained in a right ideal that contains both I1 and I2 . Since I1 and I2 are maximal, the\nonly right ideal containing them both is R. Hence aR + bR = R, and (a, b) is a unimodular\nvector of 2R.\nAll type II unimodular vectors of 2R conform to the conditions of Theorem 10.\nTheorem 11. Let R be a finite associative ring with unity. a, b, \u03b1 \u2208 R.\n1. R(\u03b1a, \u03b1b) \u2286 R(a, b).\n2. R(\u03b1a, \u03b1b) = R(a, b) if and only if \u03b1 \u2208 R\u2217 .\n3. If (a, b) is a unimodular vector in 2R, then (\u03b1a, \u03b1b) is also unimodular if and only if\n\u03b1 \u2208 R\u2217 .\nProof. 1, 2. Let R be a finite associative ring with unity. Then R(\u03b1a, \u03b1b) \u2286 R(a, b). If\n\u03b1 \u2208 R\u2217 , then R(\u03b1a, \u03b1b) = R(a, b). 3. [14, Prop 2.1].\nTheorems 10 and 11 give criteria for checking for unimodular vectors of 2R. More difficult\nis finding outliers.\n\n3\n\n\f3.2\n\nOutliers\n\nIn the light of Theorem 11 we can refine our notion of outlier.\nDefinition 12. Let R be a finite associative ring with unity. (a, b) is an outlier of 2R if\nthere does not exist \u03b1, c, d \u2208 R such that (a, b) = (\u03b1c, \u03b1d) and (c, d) is unimodular.\nTheorem 13. Let R be a finite associative ring with unity. (a, b) is an outlier of 2R if and\nonly if there exists a right ideal I \u2286 R, such that a, b \u2208 I and\n1. there are no principal right ideals which contain both a and b;\n2. for all principal right ideals \u03b1R such that a, b \u2208 \u03b1R, then aR + bR \u2282 \u03b1R.\nProof. \u21d2 Theorem 10 shows that if (a, b) is an outlier of 2R then a and b are contained\nin some maximal right ideal. Either a, b 6\u2208 \u03b1R for some \u03b1 \u2208 R \\ R\u2217 (showing part 2)\nor there exists \u03b1, c, d such that (\u03b1c, \u03b1d) = (a, b) only if (c, d) is not unimodular. Assume\nthat there exists (\u03b1c, \u03b1d) = (a, b) with (c, d) not unimodular. Let C = {c : \u03b1c = a} and\nD = {d : \u03b1d = b}. If \u03b1x = \u03b1y with x 6= y, then \u03b1(x \u2212 y) = 0, thus (x \u2212 y) \u2208 \u03b1\u22a5 . Since,\nC = {c} + \u03b1\u22a5\n\nand\n\nD = {d} + \u03b1\u22a5 ,\n\n(3)\n\none gets\naR + bR = \u03b1cR + \u03b1dR\n= \u03b1(cR + dR + \u03b1\u22a5 ).\nThus aR + bR = \u03b1R if and only if there exists c \u2208 C and d \u2208 D such that cR + dR + \u03b1\u22a5 = R.\nlet CR = {cr : c \u2208 C, r \u2208 R} and DR = {dr : d \u2208 D, r \u2208 R}. Since we can choose any c \u2208 C\nand d \u2208 D, we require that\nCR + DR + \u03b1\u22a5 = R.\nFrom equation (3) it follows:\nCR + DR + \u03b1\u22a5 = CR + DR.\nIf CR + DR = R, then there exists c \u2208 C and d \u2208 D and x, y \u2208 R such that cx + dy = 1,\nimplying that (c, d) is a unimodular vector. This contradicts that (a, b) is an outlier, and\nhence we find that aR + bR \u2282 \u03b1R (showing part 1).\n\u21d0 1. If all right ideals that contain a and b are non-principal, then there does not exist\n\u03b1 \u2208 R \\ R\u2217 such that a, b \u2208 \u03b1R. Hence (a, b) is an outlier of 2R.\n2. Let \u03b1R be a principal right ideal for which a, b \u2208 \u03b1R. Then there exists c, d such that\n\u03b1c = a and \u03b1d = b. If aR + bR \u2282 \u03b1R, then\n(\u03b1c)R + (\u03b1d)R \u2282 \u03b1R,\n\u03b1(cR + dR) \u2282 \u03b1R,\ncR + dR \u2282 R,\nand (c, d) is not unimodular. This holds for all principal right ideals containing a and b;\nhence (a, b) is an outlier.\nIf R is commutative then (a, b) is an outlier of the left module exactly when (a, b)T is\nan outlier of the right module. In a non-commutative ring, the set of left outliers may be\ndifferent to the set of right outliers (the smallest example is the ring of ternions of order 8\n[9]). The set of outliers is dependent on the structure of the ideals of the ring. If the left and\nright ideals of a ring have different structures, then a left outlier may be right unimodular.\nFrom Theorems 10 and 13 we get that:\n4\n\n\fLemma 14. If a and b are in some right ideal which is non principal, not both in any\nprincipal right ideal, and not both in the same maximal left ideal, then (a, b) is an outlier\nand (a, b)T is unimodular.\n\n3.3\n\nFree cyclic submodules and outliers\n\nWe have established that the structure of the ideals of a ring determines the set of outliers and\nunimodular vectors. The Jacobson radical is an important ideal and of crucial importance\nin the study of unimodular vectors.\nDefinition 15. [12, \u00a74] For a finite ring R, the Jacobson radical, rad(R), may be equivalently\ndefined as:\n\u2022 the intersection of all the maximal left ideals of R;\n\u2022 the largest left ideal J such that 1 + j \u2208 R\u2217 for all j \u2208 J.\nNote that the Jacobson radical is a left and right ideal.\nDefinition 16. [12, Defi 4.9] A one-sided or two-sided ideal, I, is nilpotent of nilpotency m\nif a1 .a2 . . . am = 0 for any set of elements a1 , a2 , . . . , am \u2208 I.\nLemma 17. [12, Thm 4.12] Let R be a finite associative ring. Then rad(R) is nilpotent.\nTheorem 18. Let R be a finite associative ring. Let J \u2261 rad(R). Then no vector from nJ\ngenerates a free cyclic submodule.\nProof. From Lemma 17 it readily follows that J has nilpotency m for some m \u2208 N. Let\n(a1 , a2 , . . . , an ) \u2208 nJ, x1 , x2 , . . . , xm\u22121 \u2208 J and \u03b1 = x1 .x2 . . . xm\u22121 . Then (\u03b1a1 , \u03b1a2 , . . . , \u03b1an )\n= (0, 0, . . . , 0). Hence R(a1 , a2 , . . . , an ) is not a free cyclic submodule.\nDefinition 19. [12, \u00a719] A local ring is an associative ring that has exactly one maximal\nleft (and also right) ideal.\nAs a side note we mention that geometries over local rings are called Hjelmslev geometries\n[5, \u00a79], and have applications in coding theory [1].\nTheorem 20. Let R be a local ring.\n1. No outliers of 2R generate free cyclic submodules.\n2. (a, b) is an outlier of 2R if and only if a 6\u2208 bR and b 6\u2208 aR.\nProof. 1. R has exactly one maximal ideal, which is therefore the Jacobson radical, J. All\nring elements not belonging to J are units. Hence any outlier of 2R has both entries as\nelements of J. Theorem 18 shows that no vectors with both entries from J can generate a\nfree cyclic submodule.\n2. J, the unique maximal ideal of R, cannot generate R. By Theorem 10, no unimodular\nvector of 2R can contain elements of the same maximal ideal. Since every element of R is\neither a unit or an element of J, all unimodular vectors have a unit entry; all unimodular\nvectors are of type I. So, the outliers of 2R are those vectors which are not contained in a\nfree cyclic submodule of 2R generated by (1, x) or (x, 1), x \u2208 R. A vector which is not an\noutlier is of the form\n(a, ax)\n\nor\n\n(ax, a), for some a, x \u2208 R.\n\nThus outliers are those vectors which do not fit this form. If (a, b) is contained in a free\ncyclic submodule then there exists x \u2208 R, such that ax = b or bx = a. Hence b \u2208 aR or\na \u2208 bR. If a 6\u2208 bR and b \u2208\n6 aR, then (a, b) is an outlier.\n5\n\n\fCorollary 21. If R is a finite local ring, then R(a, b) is a free cyclic submodule if and only\nif (a, b) is unimodular.\nThis is a class of rings for which all free cyclic submodules are generated by unimodular\nvectors (the reverse of Lemma 8). In particular, this means that Hjelmslev geometries (which\nare geometries over a local ring) cannot have non-unimodular points.\nNext we look at another property of ideals which precludes the existence of non-unimodular\nfree cyclic submodules.\nLemma 22. Let R be a finite associative ring with unity. Let a, b be elements of the same\nprincipal proper right ideal, \u03b1R, then R(a, b) is not a free cyclic submodule of 2R.\nProof. a = \u03b1c and b = \u03b1d. Then\n\u22a5\n\na = {x : xa = 0}\n= {x : x\u03b1c = 0}\n\u2287 {x : x\u03b1 = 0}\n=\n\nBy the same logic \u22a5b \u2287\n\n\u22a5\n\n\u03b1. Hence \u22a5a \u2229\n\n\u22a5\n\n\u03b1.\n\n\u22a5\n\nb\u2287\n\n\u22a5\n\n\u03b1 6= {0}.\n\nLemma 22 then gives the following important result.\nTheorem 23. Let R be a finite associative ring with unity. If every right ideal is a principal\nideal, then there are no free cyclic submodules of 2R generated by non-unimodular vectors.\nThis shows that a necessary condition for the existence of non-unimodular free cyclic\nsubmodules of 2R is the presence of non-principal right ideals.\nCorollary 24. Let R be a principal ideal ring, then R(a, b) is a free cyclic submodule if and\nonly if (a, b) is unimodular.\nThis is another class of rings (see Corollary 21) for which all free cyclic submodules are\ngenerated by unimodular vectors.\nWhen using associative rings, free cyclic submodules are generated by either unimodular\nvectors or outliers. If the assumption of associativity is removed, then this is no longer true.\nLemma 25. Let R be a finite ring with unity and let (a, b) be a unimodular vector in 2R. If\nthere exists \u03b1 such that (\u03b1a, \u03b1b) is a non-unimodular vector and R(\u03b1a, \u03b1b) is a free cyclic\nsubmodule of 2R, then R is non-associative.\nProof. Assume that R is associative. Then, by Theorem 3, if (\u03b1a, \u03b1b) is non-unimodular,\nthen \u03b1 \u2208 R \\ R\u2217 . If R(\u03b1a, \u03b1b) is free, then R(\u03b1a, \u03b1b) = R(a, b). Thus there exists \u03b2 \u2208 R\nsuch that\n(\u03b2\u03b1a, \u03b2\u03b1b) = (a, b),\nunder the assumption that R is associative, this requires that \u03b2\u03b1 = 1, contradicting that\n\u03b1 \u2208 R \\ R\u2217 .\nHence if there exists \u03b1 such that (\u03b1a, \u03b1b) is a non-unimodular vector and R(\u03b1a, \u03b1b) is a\nfree cyclic submodule, then R is non-associative.\nExamples have been calculated of non-associative rings of order 8, where (a, b) is unimodular, R(\u03b1a, \u03b1b) is free and R(\u03b1a, \u03b1b) 6\u2286 R(a, b).\n\n6\n\n\f4\n\nConclusion and Further Directions\n\nFor the existence of FCSs of 2R that are generated by non-unimodular vectors (\"nonunimodular FCSs\"), R must have at least two maximal right ideals, at least one of which\nis non-principal. This is a necessary condition. Calculated examples [8] show that this condition is not sufficient; other properties of a ring are required to guarantee the presence of\nFCSs generated by non-unimodular vectors.\nAs already mentioned in the introduction, in our worked examples [8] non-unimodular\nFCSs have been only found for non-commutative rings. One would be tempted to conjecture\nthat non-commutativity is essential in this respect. Yet, this is questionable because some\nrings feature non-unimodular FCSs in 2R, but not in R2 (and vice versa). Hence, it is\nhighly desirable to clarify to what extent the existence of non-unimodular FCSs depends\non the non-commutativity of the ring; in particular, what is the smallest commutative ring\nfeaturing non-unimodular FCSs?\nFurther, in all analysed examples, a non-unimodular FCS was found to share with any\nother FCS at least one vector apart from (0, 0); is this true in general, or just a feature of\nthe particular small-order rings? Finally, within our bank of examples, we found rings where\nall outliers generate FCSs (like the smallest ring of ternions [9]), as well as rings where only\nsome outliers have this property. What distinguishes the two kinds of rings? These are\nexciting open questions we would like to focus on in the near future.\n\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors wish to thank Andrea Blunk and Asha Rao for comments on early drafts.\nJLH gratefully acknowledges the support from the National Scholarship Programme of the\nSlovak Republic.
