In the present report we propose a lattice with a\nvariable momentum compaction factor and consider the\npossibility of using it in a high repetition rate proton\ndriver for a muon collider and neutrino factory.\n\nMuon Collider proton driver \u2013 200 \u03bcA or 1.25x1015 of 21\nGeV protons per second will be required. With a realistic\nnumber of ~2\u22c51013 ppp the RCS repetition rate has to be\nas high as 60 Hz.\nThe last Section of this Report presents some ideas on\nthe design of fast ramping magnets and their driving circuits which may help to achieve such a high repetition\nrate.\n\u03b2 (m)\n\n\u03b2x\n\nINTRODUCTION\nHigh power proton synchrotrons must avoid transition\nenergy crossing to reduce beam losses and high background radiation levels. The most radical solution is the\nimplementation of a lattice with negative momentum\ncompaction factor, \u03b1p < 0, so that the transition energy is\nimaginary.\nA possible drawback of this solution is correspondingly\nlarge values of the slippage factor \u03b7 at the earlier part of\nthe energy ramp. Here we define \u03b7 as:\n\n\u03b7=\n\n1\n\n\u03b3\n\n2\n\n\u03b2y\ns (m)\nDx (m)\n\n\u03b1p= 0.04\n\ns (m)\n\n\u03b1p= 0\n\u03b1p= -0.05\n\n\u2212\u03b1p\n\n(1)\n\nThe RF bucket area decreases with \u03b7 as 1/\u03b71/2, so a larger RF voltage is required with \u03b1p < 0, especially when\nthe energy gain per turn reaches its regular value but the\nbeam longitudinal emittance is still large. A possible solution to this problem is \u03b1p variation during the ramp as\ndiscussed in the following Section.\nAs an example we consider a Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) with variable momentum compaction (VMC)\nfor Fermilab Project X [1]. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide 2 MW proton beam from the Main Injector (MI) at 120 GeV for neutrino experiments and up to\n4 MW of proton beam power at 8 to 20 GeV for a future\nNeutrino Factory and Muon Collider [2].\nThe first stage of the project involves a 2.6 to 3 GeV\nproton linac. We take the lower bound - 2.6 GeV - for the\ninjection energy in our RCS. Following D. McGinnis [3],\nwe consider the possibility of injecting beam into the MI\nabove its transition energy of 20.4 GeV. Thus the RCS\nfinal energy should be at least 21 GeV.\nTo achieve the more distant Project X goal \u2013 a 4 MW\n___________________________________________\n\n* Work supported by Fermi Research Alliance, LLC under Contract\nDE-AC02-07CH11359 with the U.S. DOE and NSF Grant 757938.\n#\nalexahin@fnal.gov\n\nFigure 1: Optics functions in the VMC cell: \u03b2 -functions\nat \u03b1p = 0 (top); the dispersion function at indicated values\nof \u03b1p (bottom).\n\nVMC LATTICE\nWith \u03b1p < 0, the synchrotron tune initially can be very\nhigh, so it is advantageous to place RF cavities in dispersion-free sections, thus eliminating systematic synchrobetatron coupling. Since dispersion suppressors produce a\npositive contribution to \u03b1p, their number should be minimized to allow negative momentum compaction in the\nwhole lattice. Therefore, we choose a racetrack configuration for our RCS.\n\nArc Cell\nThe arc cell design (see Fig. 1) follows that proposed\nfor a muon collider [4]. It resembles the PS2 design [5]\nbut has some important differences: there is no free\nspaces (except those required for correctors) so the dipole\npacking is potentially higher; the maximum dispersion is\nreached at a location where both \u03b2 -functions are small\nfacilitating an independent control of \u03b1p and betatron\ntunes.\n\n\fThe number of cells per arc Ncell is a trade-off between\nthe desire to have as large an \u03b1p range as possible which\ncalls for a high dispersion (also beneficial for spacecharge tuneshift reduction) and limitations on the aperture\nand circumference. Assuming the horizontal aperture halfwidth 35 mm and the maximum momentum deviation in\nthe beam \u03b4p ~ 0.6% we may allow for dispersion values of\nup to 5 m. Limiting the bending field to 1.7 T and maximum quad gradient by 18 T/m (and inserting 0.4 m spaces\nbetween all elements) we find the optimum cell length\nLcell = 47.2 m and Ncell = 4.\nTo achieve intrinsic cancellation of the 3rd order resonances excited by chromaticity correction sextupoles\n(shown at the top of Fig. 1 with red) the phase advance\nper cell \u03bc = 270\u00b0 was chosen for both planes.\nAs already noted it is easy with this lattice to vary \u03b1p\nwhile keeping the phase advances fixed. With \u03b1p changing from -0.05 to 0.04 there is little change in the \u03b2 functions and all quad gradients remain within specified\nlimits. However, the dispersion function varies significantly (Fig. 1 bottom) crossing zero at sextupole locations\nat some values of \u03b1p. Additional study will show if extra\nsextupoles are necessary.\n\u03b2 (m)\nDx (dm)\n\u03b2x\n\u03b2y\nDx\n\ns (m)\n\nFigure 2: Optics functions in the dispersion suppressor\nand a half of straight section for \u03b1p = -0.002\n\nDispersion Suppressor & Straight Section\nA simple solution for the dispersion suppressor optics is\nshown in Fig. 2. A larger value of \u03b2 x at the bends was\nchosen deliberately to reduce the required bending angle.\nThis does not require more aperture than in the arcs since\nDx is already small at these bends. With dispersion suppressors added the bending angles and the dispersion\nfunction in the arcs are reduced by some 15% compared\nto that shown in Fig. 1.\nThe straight section length is determined by the RF system requirements. With the asymmetric rise/fall cycle and\nthe double frequency magnet power harmonic described\nin the next Section, the maximum energy gain is ~5\nMeV/turn in the 60 Hz case. Assuming the RF cavity design similar to that used in the Fermilab Booster and noting that now the lower frequency bound is 51 MHz instead of 30 MHz, we estimate the average accelerating\ngradient to be ~ 38 kV/m so that the total RF system\nlength is ~ 160 m. There are proposals which promise\neven higher gradients [6].\n\nWe set the RCS circumference at 663.835 m or 1/5 of\nthe MI circumference which gives us 188 m free space in\nthe straight sections for RF, injection and extraction kickers, and dampers.\nDue to a large contribution from the straights to the circumference the available \u03b1p range becomes smaller: from\n-0.02 to +0.018. Still, variation of \u03b1p during the ramp\nfrom negative at injection and bunching to positive and\nthen to again negative allows one to reduce the required\nRF voltage. If \u03b1p can be controlled with absolute precision of better than 0.005 this reduction can be as large as\n20% resulting in an RF voltage of 6 MV.\nThe straight section quadrupoles can be used to set the\ndesired values of betatron tunes. The optics shown in\nFig.2 correspond to Qx = 8.44, Qy = 8.46. The natural\nchromaticity of the lattice is Qx\u2032 = -17.4, Qy\u2032 = -12.0. It is\nworthwhile to note that no change is necessary in normalised strength of magnets in the dispersion suppressor and\nstraight section with varying \u03b1p. However, with different\nfrom the nominal value \u03b1p the dispersion function exhibits significant beat in the arcs.\n\nRCS MAGNET SYSTEM\nA 60 Hz ring with 1.7 T dipoles is challenging. The\nISIS ring at Rutherford Lab delivers an 800 MeV proton\nbeam of 2.5x1013 protons per pulse at 50 Hz, but the dipoles only run up to 0.7 T [7]. A 1250 Hz pulsed wiggler\nat Brookhaven Laboratory has achieved 2.1 T using a\nvanadium permendur lamination yoke and a 4mm gap [8].\nAmperage and voltage of dipole magnets are as follows\n[9]:\n(2)\nI = B h / \u03bc 0 N, V = \u03c0 B f N w l,\nwhere h, w, and l are the gap height, width, and length, N\nis the number of coil turns, and f is frequency. Using an\noffset White circuit [10] rather than an LC circuit halves\nthe voltage. With a 0.05m x 0.1m x 3m magnet gap, 1.7 T\nB field, 120 Hz fall frequency, and 18 coil turns, one gets\n3800 amps and 3500 volts, which is large but probably\ndoable. The voltage to ground can be halved to 1750 via a\ncenter tap.\nTo give more time for RF acceleration, an asymmetric\ncycle is used with a 40 Hz rise and a 120 Hz fall. A double frequency harmonic is added to the power supply so\nthat the RF cavities can deliver their maximum gradient\nduring a larger fraction of the rise cycle.\nSmall copper wire around a stainless steel cooling tube\nwith flowing water is used to reduce eddy currents in the\nmagnet conductor. The new ISIS choke at Rutherford Lab\nuses this method [11]. The cable is made by Trench Ltd.\nThe Japan Accelerator Research Complex uses thin aluminium wire around a stainless steel cooling tube [12].\nTo minimize stored energy (B2/2\u03bc) and hysteresis and\neddy current losses in the dipole yokes, thin 3% grain\noriented silicon steel laminations are used [13]. At 1.7 T\nin the grain direction \u03bc/\u03bc 0 has a value of 30000, but the\nvalue falls to 3000 at 10o away from the grain direction.\nAt 1.3 T in the grain direction \u03bc/\u03bc 0 has a value of 47000,\n\n\fbut the relative permeability falls to 14000, 540, and 2300\nat 10o, 55o, and 90o away from the grain direction, respectively [14]. The 55o minimum comes from the long diagonal (111) of the steel crystal. At 1.7 T, \u03bc/\u03bc 0 for\n0.0025% ultra low carbon steel is 600 [15] or 50 times\nless than high grade grain oriented silicon steel. If stored\nenergy density (B2/2\u03bc) in the dipole yoke is not minimized, power supply voltages and amperages will rise. To\ntake advantage of grain oriented steel, large 3-phase transformers are built with 45o mitred joints [16]. So magnet\nlaminations may need to be laid out as shown in Fig. 3.\nTests of fast ramping prototype dipole magnets with 3%\ngrain oriented silicon steel laminations are in progress at\nthe University of Mississipi-Oxford.\n\nTable 1: RCS Parameters\nEnergy\n\nGeV\n\n2.6 \u2192 21\n\nCircumference\n\nm\n\n663.835\n\nMaximum B field\n\nT\n\n1.7\n\nRepetition rate\n\nHz\n\n60\n\nRF frequency\n\nMHz\n\n50.9 \u2192 52.8\n\nMaximum RF voltage\n\nMV\n\n6\n\nRF bucket area\n\neV\u22c5s\n\n0.6\n\nProtons/bunch\n\n1011\n\n2\n\nBunch number\n\n-\n\n112\n\n95% Emittance\n\n\u03c0\u22c5mm\u22c5mrad\n\n20\n\nSpace charge tuneshift\n(Gaussian distribution)\n\n-\n\n0.2\n\nBeam power\n\nMW\n\n4.5\n\nREFERENCES\nFigure 3: Alternating dipole laminations of 3% grain\noriented silicon steel. The arrows show the B field direction and the grain direction. The B field and the grain\ndirections are parallel.\n\nPower Losses in Magnets\nThe mass of the magnets is about 600 metric tons and\nthe steel laminations consume 0.9 watts/kg with a 1.5 T\naverage field and 60 Hz due to eddy currents and hysteresis losses. This works out to a total of 540 kilowatts for all\nthe laminations. I2R losses for 18 turns of 3cm x 3cm\nstranded copper cables carrying 3800 amps of sinusoidal\ncurrent for 270 meters of magnets works out to 1300 kilowatts.\nThe power dissipated in a round wire by eddy currents\nper unit volume is (2\u03c0 f B d)2 / 24\u03c1, where f is frequency,\nB is magnetic field, d is diameter, and \u03c1 is resistivity [13].\nSo a copper volume of 9 m3, 0.002m diameter copper\nwire, an 0.2 T fringe field, and 60 Hz results in eddy current losses of 500 kilowatts. Total losses are approximately 2.3 megawatts for all magnets.\n\nSUMMARY\nThe basic parameters of the proposed machine are\nsummarized in Table 1.\nThe presented design is a preliminary one and leaves\nmany issues untouched, such as suppression of coherent\nbeam instabilities at the considered intensity. We plan to\naddress these issues in the future.\n\n[1] S. Holmes, \"Fermilab Project X\", this Conference.\n[2] C. Ankenbrandt et al., Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams 2\n(1999) 081001; D.
