O. Dzero\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0004454v3 [cond-mat.str-el] 11 Dec 2000\n\nNational High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, 32304, USA\n(November 16, 2018)\nWe have verified that the variational mean field theory approach suggested by Narimanov and\nVarma (preprint cond-mat/0002191) being applied to the realistic two-band model provides a good\nagreement with experimental data for the Curie temperature in doped manganites A1\u2212x Bx MnO3\n(x \u2243 0.3). We have also considered the problem of an interplay between the ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic interactions by using the same approach.\n\nThe problem of finding the value of the critical temperature for the paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition in\ndoped manganites has presented a lot of interest recently. An agreement of theoretical predictions with experimental results for the Curie temperature may shed some light on physical mechanisms driving the transition near the\nconcentration region, where the colossal magneto-resistance (CMR) effect takes place.\nAn interesting approach for obtaining the value for the transition temperature has been recently proposed by\nNarimanov and Varma1 (see also2 ) and is based on the variational mean field theory within the formalism of the\ndouble exchange (DE) model3\u20135 . The final result for the critical temperature dependence on concentration1,2 can be\napproximately written in the following form:\nTc \u2243 x (1 \u2212 x) W,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere W is a bandwidth. For W = 1.8 eV and 0.15 \u2264 x \u2264 0.3 Eq. (1) recovers the experimentally observed values for\nthe Curie temperature. This result can be generalized in such a way, that the DE model works well in order to describe\nthe physics near the CMR region6,7 and in principle one does not need to take into account other mechanisms8,9 which\nmight effect the transition.\nIn what follows we adopt the variational mean field theory scheme for the DE model via degenerate orbitals10 in\norder to verify the validity of the two-band approach11,12 near the CMR region. In the DE model within the two-band\nscheme, there is no electron-hole symmetry, which means that the Curie temperature is non-symmetric with respect\nto substitution x \u2192 1 \u2212 x. Since for the small concentrations percolation effects play an essential role11,13 , we will be\nprimarily concerned with obtaining the value for the Curie temperature near the CMR region (x \u223c 0.3). As we will\nsee, the approach we are using works well and recovers the right numerical value for the Curie temperature in units of\nhopping amplitude the value for which in the two-band model for manganites has been estimated in12 . The relative\nsimplicity of present approach also allows us to consider a problem of suppression of the ferromagnetic transition by\nthe superexchange interaction14\u201316 .\nWe consider three t2g electrons on a Mn ion as the localized classical spins. The Hamiltonian for the DE model on\nthe degenerate orbitals can be defined as:\nHDE = \u2212\n\nX\n\n\u2020\ntab\nij *cia\u03b1 cjb\u03b1 \u2212 JH\n\nX\n\nS~i *c\u2020ia\u03b1 ~\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 cia\u03b2 .\n\n(2)\n\ni\n\nhiji\n\nThe matrix elements tab\nij describe the electrons, hopping from one site to another, on two-fold degenerate eg orbitals.\nAs it was shown by Anderson and Hasegawa 4 , in the limit of strong Hund's coupling, the hopping amplitude of the\nelectrons between the sites i and j acquires an angular dependence tij = t(\u03b8ij ), where \u03b8ij is the angle between the core\n~i and S\n~j . In the DE model the hopping amplitude is the largest, when the spins are aligned, which means that\nspins S\na ferromagnetic state minimizes the kinetic energy. Thus, the effective Hamiltonian for our problem can be written\nas:\nX\n~ i *S\n~j .\nS\n(3)\nH = HDE + J\nhiji\n\nWe employ the variational mean field theory by introducing the spin orientation distribution function P (\u03a9) =\nIn the mean field approximation, the distribution function depends only on single spin orientation, which is\ndescribed by an angle \u03b8. The idea is to represent the free energy of our system as a functional of P (\u03b8) and, following\nthe standard mean field treatment, to find the self-consistent equation for the distribution function.\nThe free energy is defined as:\n1\n2\u03c0 P (\u03b8).\n\nF = Eel + Espin \u2212 T * Sspin ,\n1\n\n(4)\n\n\fwhere Sspin is the entropy of our system, Eel is electron energy, Espin is the spin energy.\nAs mentioned above, the distribution function for the system of spins is just the product of the distribution functions\nof the individual spins. Thus, in the semiclassical limit, the entropy can be written as:\nSspin = \u2212\n\nZ\u03c0\n\nd\u03b8 sin \u03b8P (\u03b8) log[P (\u03b8)].\n\n(5)\n\n0\n\nIn the absence of a magnetic field, the spin energy contribution, Espin , in the classical limit, is just the average of\nthe superexchange Hamiltonian:\nEspin\n\nJ\n=\n2\n\nZ2\u03c0\n\nd\u03c61\n2\u03c0\n\n0\n\nZ2\u03c0\n\nd\u03c62\n2\u03c0\n\n0\n\nZ\u03c0\n\nd\u03b81 sin \u03b81 P (\u03b81 )\n\nZ\u03c0\n\nd\u03b82 sin \u03b82 P (\u03b82 ) cos(\u03b8),\n\n(6)\n\n0\n\n0\n\nwhere cos(\u03b8) = cos \u03b81 cos \u03b82 + sin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 cos(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 ).\nThe electron energy is calculated as follows. First, we calculate the energy for a given spin distribution, E[t] and\nthen we just take the average of E[t] over all possible spin configurations:\nZ\nEel = dtP (t)E[t].\n(7)\nTo calculate E[t] we adopt the tight binding approximation. For the two-dimensional representation eg we choose\nthe normalized complex functions \u03c81 and \u03c82 , given by11 :\n\u03c81 \u221d z 2 + \u01ebx2 + \u01eb2 y 2 , \u03c82 \u2261 \u03c81\u2217 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u01eb = exp(2\u03c0i/3).\nThe cubic spectrum consists of two branches:\nq\nn\no\n\u03b51,2 (p) = \u2212t(\u03b8) * (cx + cy + cz ) \u00b1 c2x + c2y + c2z \u2212 cx cy \u2212 cy cz \u2212 cz cx\n\n(9)\n\n(we introduced the notations ci = cos(ki a), i = x, y, z). Since there is an interaction between the eg electrons and the\nmagnetic background,following the discussion by Anderson and Hasegawa, we have introduced the effective hopping\namplitude t(\u03b8) =| A | cos(\u03b8/2) (\u03b8 is the angle between the two neighboring spins and | A | is a hopping amplitude,\nwhose numerical value will be defined later).\nThus, the electron energy for a given spin configuration is:\nE[t] =\n\n2 Z\nX\ni=1\n\ndk\n\u03b5i (k, \u03b8)*nF [\u03b5i (k, \u03b8)],\n(2\u03c0)3\n\n(10)\n\nwhere nF is Fermi distribution function.\nUsing the expressions (5,6,10) and the Lagrange variational method, the free energy functional acquires the following\nform:\nF [P\u03b8 ; \u03bc, \u03be] =\n\nZ2\u03c0\n\nd\u03c61\n2\u03c0\n\n2 Z\nX\ni=1\n\nd\u03c62\n2\u03c0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n(\n\nZ2\u03c0\n\nZ\u03c0\n\nd\u03b81 sin \u03b81 P (\u03b81 )\n\nZ\u03c0\n\nd\u03b82 sin \u03b82 P (\u03b82 ) \u00d7\n\n0\n\n0\n\n)\nZ\u03c0\ndk\nJ\n(\u03b5i (k, \u03b8) \u2212 \u03bb)\u00d7nF [\u03b5i (k, \u03b8)] + cos(\u03b8) + T d\u03b8 sin \u03b8 \u00d7\n(2\u03c0)3\n2\n\nP (\u03b8) log[P (\u03b8)] + \u03be\n\n0\n\nZ\u03c0\n\nd\u03b8 sin \u03b8P (\u03b8) \u2212 \u03bcB SB\n\nZ2\u03c0\n0\n\n0\n\nsin \u03b81 cos \u03b81 P (\u03b81 ) + Fe[\u03bb, \u03be]\n\nd\u03c61\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\u03c0\n\nd\u03b81 \u00d7\n\n0\n\n(11)\n\n(\u03bb is a Lagrange multiplier, being a constraint to have a constant number of conduction electrons in our system, \u03be\nis a Lagrange multiplier, which provides the normalization for P (\u03b8) and Fe [\u03bb, \u03be] is a \u03b8 independent part of the free\n2\n\n\fenergy, B is a external magnetic field). Since the number of conduction electrons is conserved in our system, the free\nenergy functional acquires its minimal value for \u03bb being equal to the chemical potential \u03bc, which is defined, in our\ncase, by the following expression:\n1\u2212x=\n\n2 Z\nX\n\ndk\nnF [(\u03b5i (k, \u03b8 = 0) \u2212 \u03bc)/T ],\n(2\u03c0)3\n\ni=1\n\nwhere x is the hole concentration.\nNow, taking the functional derivative of (11) with respect to P (\u03b8), we obtain the following integral equation:\n\uf8ee\nZ2\u03c0\nZ\u03c0\nZ2\u03c0\nd\u03c6\nd\u03c6\n2\n1\nd\u03b81 sin \u03b81 P (\u03b81 ) \u00d7\nP (\u03b8) = exp \uf8f0\u22122\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n0\n0\n0\n( 2 Z\n)\nX\ndk (\u03b5i (k, \u03b8) \u2212 \u03bc)\nJ\nnF [\u03b5i (k, \u03b8)] +\ncos(\u03b8) \u2212\n(2\u03c0)3\nT\n2T\ni=1\n\u0015\n\u03bcB SB\ncos \u03b8 .\n(12)\n\u03be/T +\nT\nThe integral equation (12) is nothing but variational mean-field theory equation for the distribution function P (\u03b8),\nwhere P (\u03b8) plays the role of the order parameter. If the system is in the paramagnetic phase, P (\u03b8) is uniform.\nEquation (12) allows a numerical solution. Its results are shown on Fig. 1.\n\n1.2\n\nT=0.95TC , J=0\nT=0.95TC , J=0.05|A|\nT=0.95TC , J=0.1|A|\n\n1.0\n\nP(\u03b8)\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n\u03b8\n\nFIG. 1. The single spin orientation distribution function P (\u03b8) is shown as a function of \u03b8 for different values of the antiferromagnetic exchange constant J. The results are obtained for hole concentration x \u2243 0.3.\n\nAs soon as the temperature decreases (in the presence of a small magnetic field) and approaches the Curie temperature Tc , small deviations from the uniform distribution will appear in P (\u03b8):\nP (\u03b8)|T \u2192Tc =\n\n1\n+ \u2206(\u03b8), \u2206(\u03b8) \u226a 1.\n2\n\n(13)\n\nSince \u2206(\u03b8) is small, we can expand both sides of Eq.

The results can be written in the following form:\nB cos \u03b8\n,\nT \u2212 Tc\n( 2 Z\nZ\u03c0\nX\nTc = d\u03b8 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\n\n\u2206(\u03b8) \u221d\n\n0\n\ni=1\n\n)\ndk\nJ\n(\u03bc \u2212 \u03b5i (k))\u00d7nF [\u03b5i (k)] \u2212 cos(\u03b8) .\n(2\u03c0)3\n2\n\n(14)\n\nThus, as it is seen from (14), the ferromagnetic transition is linearly suppressed by the superexchange interaction,\nin agreement with previous results obtained in14 . The energy scale is defined in the units of the hopping amplitude,\n3\n\n\f| A |. The experimental results for the spin-wave stiffness coefficient provide | A |=0.16 eV (see e.g.12 and references\ntherein).\nAs we see in Fig. 2, Tc decreases as system is doped with holes. For concentrations, where the CMR effect is\nvery pronounced (x \u2243 0.3), the value we found for the critical temperature is equal to 390 K, which is in good\nagreement with the experimental data. Hence, the DE model via degenerate orbitals alone gives a good value for the\ncritical temperature. For small concentrations our result does not agree with experimental observations, in which Tc\nis increasing with doping. Such a behavior for small concentrations can be explained in terms of percolation theory\n(see11\u201313 and references therein) and can not be captured by using the present approach.\n\n0.45\n\n0.40\n\n0.35\n\nTC / |A|\n\n0.30\n\n0.25\n\n0.20\n\n0.15\n\n0.10\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nX (hole concentration)\n\nFIG. 2. Curie temperature is plotted as a function of hole concentration x.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown, that the variational mean field theory can successfully describe the paramagneticto-ferromagnetic transition for x \u223c 0.3 in the frame of the DE model when the two-fold degeneracy of the eg levels\nis taken into account. We have also discussed the competition between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic\nexchange interactions. Although the phonons might play an essential role in the high-temperature properties of the\nmanganites near the metallic region (isotope effect), the other mechanism for suppressing the ferromagnetic phase is\nthe superexchange interaction between the t2g core spins.\nWe thank L.
