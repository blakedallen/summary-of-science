China\n\narXiv:hep-ph/0112319v2 8 May 2002\n\nNovember 1, 2018\nAbstract\nWe estimate in this paper the errors in the zenith angle distribution for the charged current events of\nthe solar neutrinos caused by the uncertainty of the earth electron density. In the model of PREM with\na 5% uncertainty in the earth electron density we numerically calculate the corrections to the correlation\nbetween [N ]5 /[N ]2 and [N ]2 /[N ]3 , and find the errors notable.\n\nForthcoming results from SNO[1] include a measurement of the day-night asymmetry (ADN )[2, 3, 4, 5].\nThis measurement is crucial to confirming the matter conversion solution to the solar neutrino problem. And\nthe analysis on the zenith angle distribution of the events during the night may provide some insights to\ndistinguish the various MSW solutions, i.e. LMA, LOW and SMA[6]. In the calculation of the regenerated\n\u03bde flux, the electron density of the earth matter with which the neutrinos interact is a critical quantity. The\nuncertainty in Earth-matter density and chemical component can be a major cause of the error in ADN\nand the zenith angle distribution. So it will be interesting to estimate these errors. Furthermore since the\nexperimental value of the ADN is around \u223c 0.047[2] and the theoretical expectations on the zenith angle\ndistributions are small in magnitude[6], it is necessary to perform a quantitative estimation on these errors.\nIn this paper, we follow the procedure outlined in [7] and study the uncertainty in the earth matter\ndensity, then investigate its implications on the predictions of ADN and the zenith angle distributions. We\nquantify the uncertainties of the earth matter in terms of two parameters: one is \u03b4Ne /Ne , the variation\nin magnitude of the density which generally is expected to be around a few percent; the second one is \u03b4x\nwhich specifies the limitation on the spacial dimension by geophysics experiments and inverting calculations\nused in the fit of the earth density models. In general the scale \u03b4x is not much larger than the neutrino\noscillation length, e.g., in the case with the parameters of the favored LMA solution, so its effect might arise\nbeyond the linear order. We will show in this paper that this effect causes an sizable error in the zenith\nangle distributions.\nTo begin with we consider a two-neutrino mixing model for simplicity. As discussed in[8, 4] the neutrino\ncan be treated as a incoherent mixture of two mass eigenstates. In the day-time the survival probability for\n\u03bde is given by,\nP D = P1 cos2 \u03b8 + (1 \u2212 P1 ) sin2 \u03b8 ,\n(1)\nwhere the mixing angle is defined through,\n\n\u03bd1 = cos \u03b8 \u03bde \u2212 sin \u03b8 \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd2 = sin \u03b8 \u03bde + cos \u03b8 \u03bd\u03bc ,\n\n(2)\n\nand P1 is the probability of the \u03bde \u2192 \u03bd1 conversion inside the sun[9, 6]. During the night time, the presence\nof the earth matter leads to a zenith angle dependent regeneration of the \u03bde ,\nP N = P1 + (1 \u2212 2P1 )P2e = P D \u2212 2Xfreg ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere P2e is the probability of the \u03bd2 \u2192 \u03bde conversion inside the Earth, X = P1 \u2212 1/2.

If the\ndensity is known, the regeneration factor freg = P2e \u2212 sin2 \u03b8 can be calculated accurately. As an example\nwe take the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM)[10] and plot in Fig.1.(a) the regeneration factor as\na function of the zenith angle. In the numerical calculation we take the neutrino energy to be 11 MeV and\nthe oscillation parameters to be[11]\nLM A : \u2206m12 = 3.7 \u00d7 10\u22125 , tan2 \u03b8 = 0.37 ,\n\nLOW : \u2206m12 = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22127 , tan2 \u03b8 = 0.67\n\n(8)\n\nOne can see from this figure that the regeneration factors oscillate periodically with certain lengths. And\ndifferent oscillation lengths correspond to different MSW solutions.\nGiven the parameters in Eq.(8) and the standard solar density[12], we follow [6, 9] and obtain numerically\nthat cos 2\u03b8S \u2248 \u22121 and Pc \u2248 0, which can be used to get the \u03bde \u2192 \u03bd1 conversion in the Sun. Fluctuations\nin the solar density will affect P1 , consequently also influence the MSW solutions[13]. In that situation a\nvariance of P D has been defined to estimate the relevant error [14]. In this paper, however, we concentrate\non the errors caused by the uncertainty of EeD.\nThe EeD available today, is known only to some certain precision [15, 16]. As to PREM, significant\nuncertainties due to the local variation have been documented[17]. Quantitatively its precision is roughly\n5% averaged per spherical shell with thickness of 100 Km or so [18]. The uncertainties of the Earth matter\ndensity cause errors in the calculation of the \u03bde survival probability during the night time. In the following\nwe study numerically the uncertainties in the solar neutrino zenith angle distributions.\nAs described detailly in [7], we introduce a weighted average over the whole sample space of possible earth\ndensity profile. Denoting the\nR averaged earth density function, such as the widely used PREM by N\u0302e (x), we\nhave N\u0302e (x) =< Ne (x) >= [DNe ]F [Ne (x), x][DNe ] where F [Ne (x), x][DNe ] is the probability of obtaining\nthe EeD Ne (x) in the neighborhood of x,\nF [Ne (x), x] =\ns(x) =\n\n1\n\u221a\nexp{\u2212 ln2 \u230a Ne (x)/N0 (x) \u230b/\u23082s2 (x)\u2309},\nNe (x) 2\u03c0s(x)\n\np\nln\u23081 + r2 (x) \u2309, N0 (x) = N\u0302e (x)exp\u230a\u2212s2 (x)/2 \u230b,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere r(x) = \u03c3(x)/N\u0302e (x) characterizes the precision of the earth electron density.\nThe averaged value and the variance of the \u03bd2 \u2192 \u03bde conversion probability can be written now separately\nas,\nZ\n< P2e (E\u03bd , \u03b8z ) > \u2261\nP2e (\u03b8z )F [Ne\u03b8z (x)][DNe\u03b8z ]\n=\n\nlim\n\nI\u2192\u221e\n\nZ Y\nI\n\ni=1\n\nF [Ne\u03b8z (xi ), xi ]dNe\u03b8z (xi ) \u00d7\n\nP2e (\u03b8z )[{Ne\u03b8z (x1 ), ...Ne\u03b8z (xi ), ...Ne\u03b8z (xI )}]\n=\n\u03b4freg\n\nlim K \u22121\n\nK\u2192\u221e\n\nK\nX\n\nP\u0303k (Ne(k) ),\n\nk=1\n\nq\n2 (E , \u03b8 ) > \u2212< P (E , \u03b8 ) >2\n= \u03b4P2e (E\u03bd , \u03b8z ) \u2261 < P2e\n\u03bd z\n2e\n\u03bd z\n\u22121\n\n= [ lim (K \u2212 1)\nK\u2192\u221e\n\nK\nX\n\nk=1\n\n2\n\n1/2\n\nP\u0303k \u2212 < P2e >\n\n\u00012\n\n]\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\n\fWe evaluate the functional integrations in Eq.(10) using a method similar to that of the lattice gauge theory.\nIn the numerical calculation we discretize the neutrino path into I bins, \u03b4xi (i = 1, 2, ...I) and in the i-th\nbin the EeD function Ne (x) is given by Eq.(9). Furthermore we have replaced the functional integration\n(k)\nover the EeD by a sum over K arrays, Ne k=1, 2, ...K. In Eq.(10) P\u0303k is the conversion probability\n(k)\n(k)\n\u2032\nevaluated with the k th density profile Ne . As to PREM each point in the array Ne which consists of\nNe (x1 ), ....Ne (xi ), ....Ne (xI ) is generated from PREM weighted with a Gaussian-like logarithm distribution.\nSince the deviation from PREM due to local variation is roughly 5% and the deviation is averaged per\nspherical shell with thickness of 100 Km, we take r = 5% and choose the bin sizes \u03b4xi to be the distance the\nneutrino travels along the path of zenith angle \u03b8z within a spherical shell of thickness 100 Km. So in general\n\u03b4xi will not be equal except for \u03b8z = 0.\nd\u03c1\nWe note that the EeD uncertainty scale \u03b4x differs from the one, l\u03c1 = \u03c1/ dx\nconsidered in [6] to characterize\nthe flatness (adiabaticity) of the density profile. Both of these scales are important to the studies on the\nneutrino oscillations in matter. The effects of the l\u03c1 can be taken into account in the exact numerical\ncalculation, however to reduce the error caused by \u03b4x a more precise density profile is needed. Especially\nwhen \u03b4x is comparable to the neutrino oscillation length in matter, one has to be careful in estimating the\nerrors for oscillation probability.\nIn Fig.1.(b) we plot \u03b4freg and freg as a function of the zenith angle. One can see from this figure that\nLMA suffers a larger error. For LOW the error is roughly two percent and for SMA the error is much smaller.\nSo we have not shown them in the figure. Integrated over the zenith angle, it gives rise to a correction of\n20% roughly to the ADN for LMA, however the corrections are small for LOW and SMA. Combined with\nFig.1.(a), we see that the errors are small so that ALMA\nand ALOW\ncan be distinguished.\nDN\nDN\nTo see the effects on the solar neutrino observations, we now estimate the errors in the rate of the charged\ncurrent events during the night time. Following [6] we define the normalized rate of the charged current\nevents as,\n[CC](\u03b8z ) \u2261\n=\n=\n\nSSM\nNCC /NCC\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nN\nSSM\ndE\u03bd P (E\u03bd , \u03b8z )\u03a6(E\u03bd ) dT d cos \u03b8L \u03c3\u0302(E\u03bd , T , cos \u03b8L )R(Te , T )/NCC\ndTe\nEth\nE\u03bd\nZ\nSSM\n,\n(11)\ndE\u03bd \u03a6(E\u03bd )P N (E\u03bd , \u03b8z )\u03c3CC (E\u03bd )/NCC\nE\u03bd0\n\nwhere \u03a6(E\u03bd ) contains both the neutrino flux from the Boron decay and the He + P chain in the sun[19, 5],\nSSM\nand NCC\nis the normalization factor which equals to the integral in r.h.s. taken at P N = 1. From the 2'nd\nto the 3'rd line of Eq.(11), the integration of the differential cross section \u03c3\u0302 with respect to the recoil electron\nkinetics Te and the scatting angle \u03b8L has been replaced by a total charged current cross section \u03c3CC of the\nneutrino on the Deuteron, since the possible uncertainty from Te , \u03b8L can be canceled in the [CC] as a ratio\nSSM\nof NCC to NCC\n. The E\u03bd dependence in \u03c3CC is accessed by employing a quick function from interpolation\nin [20]. The starting point of the neutrino energy is set at E\u03bd0 \u2248 Q + Eth , with Q = 1.442M eV being the\ndeuterium threshold energy and Eth = 5M eV the electron threshold energy. In Fig.2, we plot the zenith\nangle distribution of the charged current events rate in Eq.(11). One can see that the SNO charged current\ndata lies in the middle between the LMA and LOW. This serves also as a check of our numerical calculation.\nFollowing the binning method of [6], we plot in Fig.3.(a) and Fig.3.(b) the charged current events v.s. bins\n(note for the fifth bin cos \u03b8z \u223c (0.83, 0.92) in the case of SNO), which shows that,\nLM A : [N ]1 < [N ]2 \u2264 [N ]3 \u2264 [N ]4 \u2264 [N ]5 ,\n\nLOW : [N ]2 \u2265 [N ]4 > [N ]1 \u223c [N ]3 > [D].\n\n(12)\n\nQuantitatively, it reads, [N ]5 /[N ]2 = 0.999 \u2248 1 and [N ]2 /[N ]3 = 0.995 \u2248 1 for LMA while [N ]5 /[N ]2 =\n0.982, [N ]2/[N ]3 = 1.053 for LOW, from which it might be possible to distinguish LMA from LOW. The\ncalculation for SMA can be easily worked out, however for simplicity we will not repeat it here.\nMaking use of Eqs.(11), (10), and (3) we estimate the errors in the charged current events rate caused\nby the uncertainties in the earth electron density\nZ\ndE\u03bd \u03a6(E\u03bd )(\u22122X\u03b4freg )\u03c3CC (E\u03bd ),\n(13)\n\u03b4[CC] \u221d\nE\u03bd0\n\nwhich we show in Fig.(4) by the error-bars. To avoid multi-fold integration which is a computer time consuming, we investigate \u03b4freg at neutrino energies of 8, 10, 11, 12 MeV and find the results almost unchanged.\nTo be conservative we have used the maximal value for \u03b4freg .\n3\n\n\fWe see from the figure that the errors become larger as the zenith angle increases in the case of LMA.\nAveraged over bins we have ([N ]5 \u2212 \u03b4[N ]5 )/[N ]2 \u2248 0.935 while ([N ]2 + \u03b4[N ]2 )/([N ]3 \u2212 \u03b4[N ]3 ) \u2248 1.043. As\nindicated in the figures 13-16 of [6] that the LMA sheet in their correlation figures mainly stretched along\nthe ADN direction, we study a correlation between [N ]5 /[N ]2 and [N ]2 /[N ]3 , which we show in Fig.5. One\nsees that the point (1, 1) for LMA is swollen into a rectangle close to the point ( 0.982, 1.053 ) for LOW. In\nthis figure we have not shown the error bars for LOW since they are small.\nSo far the precision of PREM which we assume is 5%. Certainly errors on the zenith angle distribution\nbecome larger if the uncertainty in the earth electron density is bigger. Sure a modern Earth's density model\nwith higher precision will reduce the errors considered in this paper. As an example we take density model\nAK135[21]. The precision of AK135 is widely considered to be about 1 \u223c 2%, and its uncertainty scale\nis roughly \u03b4x \u2248 50 Km since the model was presented in a data table. Taking a 2% uncertainty in the\nelectron density we show our results in Figure. 6. one finds ([N ]5 \u2212 \u03b4[N ]5 )/([N ]2 + \u03b4[N ]2 ) \u2248 1.033 while\n([N ]2 + \u03b4[N ]2 )/([N ]3 \u2212 \u03b4[N ]3 ) \u2248 1.017. From Fig.6.(b), we see the gap between LMA and LOW enlarged.\nThis makes it easier to distinguish the LMA from LOW than the prediction from PREM.\nIn summary, we have estimated in this paper the errors in the zenith angle distribution of the charged\ncurrent event rates of the solar neutrinos originated from the electron density uncertainty. Our results show\nthat the corrections are not significant in the case of LOW and SMA, however, error is notable for LMA.\nEven though our estimations are given for specific parameters and qualitatively, the results of this paper\nindicate that to observe the zenith angle distribution a precise knowledge on the Earth electron density is\nnecessary.\nThe work is supported in part by the NSF of China under Grant No 19925523 and also supported by the\nMinistry of Science and Technology of China under Grant No NKBRSF G19990754.\n\nReferences\n[1] Q.R.Ahmad et al., SNO Coll. , nucl-exp/0106015\n[2] Super-Kamiokande Collaborattion, hep-ex/9812009, or Phys.Rev.Lett. 82 (1999) 1810\n[3] A.J.Baltz and J.Weneser, Phys.Rew.D35(87) 528 ; 37(88) 3364 ; G.L.Fogli et.al., IASSNS-AST 96/21\n; J.N.Bachall, P.I.Krastev and A.Yu.Smirnov, Phys.Rev.D 60 (1999)093001\n[4] E.Lisi and D.
