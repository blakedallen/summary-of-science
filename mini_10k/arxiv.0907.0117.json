Due to the simple behaviour of\nthe weak effective hamiltonian under U -spin and the unique structure of the breaking terms such\na group theoretical analysis leads to a manageable number of parameters. Several applications are\ndiscussed, including the decays B \u2192 J/\u03c8K and B \u2192 DK.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nNon-leptonic decays of bottom hadrons play an important role in the investigation of CP violation.\nWhile this effect has been established in non-leptonic Kaon decays, and the CKM mechanism of CP\nviolation is consistent with what is seen in non-leptonic B meson decays, the observations cannot be\neasily linked with the fundamental parameters.\nThe reason for this is the lack of a reliable method to compute the amplitudes of non-leptonic decays, which are given by matrix elements of an effective interaction expressed in terms of a combination of four-quark operators between meson states. The QCD dynamics turn out to be so complicated,\nthat currently neither factorization based methods nor lattice calculations yield reliable and precise\npredictions.\nWhile non-leptonic decays are a nice laboratory for studying QCD methods, the road to precise\npredictions for CP violation in non-leptonic B decays seems to be the use of flavour symmetries,\nsupplemented by the enormous amount of data expected from LHC and the (Super) flavour factories.\nFrom the current perspective this will remain true for some time, until a qualitative breakthrough is\nachieved in the field of QCD methods.\nThere is a vast literature in the field of flavour symmetries and their applications to B decays.\nThe complete decomposition of the two-body B decay amplitudes in terms of irreducible flavour\nSU (3) matrix elements has been performed in [1, 2]. Applications to B decays have been considered\nin [3\u20138], and we shall use the notation of [9]. Furthermore, flavour-symmetry strategies related to the\nextraction of CP violating parameters have been discussed in [9\u201312].\nThe main problem with flavour symmetries is that they hold only approximately. The usual starting point is flavour SU (3), which suffers from a substantial breaking due to the sizable mass of the\nstrange quark [13]. On the other hand, the isospin subgroup is known to have a much smaller breaking, and can be safely assumed to be unbroken in this context. Hence one may consider the other two\npossibilities to identify SU (2) subgroups of flavour SU (3), which run under the names U -spin and\nV -spin. Among these two subgroups, the generators of U -spin, under which the d and the s quark\nform a fundamental doublet, commute with the charge operator, which makes this subgroup particularly interesting with respect to electroweak interactions. On the other hand, U -spin symmetry is\nbroken at the same level as the full flavour SU (3) due to the splitting ms \u2212 md .\nHowever, this breaking has a simple structure and can be readily included by a spurion analysis.\nIn the present paper we perform such an analysis and apply it to non-leptonic B decays. We make use\nof present data to extract the symmetry-breaking matrix elements and give relations which include\nU -spin breaking, which can be tested in the future, once more data are available.\n\n2\n\nFlavour Symmetries\n\nU -spin is an SU (2) subgroup of the full SU (3) flavour symmetry group, in which the d and the s\nquark form a doublet. A priori, U -spin is as badly broken as the full SU (3), since the masses of the\n\n1\n\n\ftwo quarks are substantially different:\n\u2206m \u2261 ms \u2212 md \u223c \u039bQCD ,\nwhere \u039bQCD denotes the nonperturbative QCD scale. Regarding the group structure of the breaking\nterm, we observe that the relevant mass term in the Lagrangian reads\n \u0304 + ms s\u0304s = 1 (ms + md )(dd\n \u0304 + s\u0304s) + 1 \u2206m(s\u0304s \u2212 dd)\n \u0304\nLs mass = md dd\n2\n2\n1\n1\n=\n(ms + md )q\u0304q \u2212 \u2206mq\u0304\u03c43 q ,\n2\n2\nwhere\nd\ns\n\nq=\n\n(2.1)\n\n!\n\nis the U -spin quark doublet. Thus we conclude that the breaking term can be described as a triplet\nspurion\n1\n(1)\n(2.2)\nHbreak = \u2206m\u03c43 = \u000fB0 ,\n2\n(1)\n\nwhere B0 is an irreducible tensor-operator with j = 1 and j3 = 0 of U -spin. Here we also introduce\nthe small quantity \u000f related to the symmetry breaking \u000f \u223c \u2206m/\u039b\u03c7SB where \u039b\u03c7SB is the chiral\nsymmetry breaking scale.\nIf we consider a matrix element of some operator O(x), which can be decomposed into irreducible\ntensor-operators of U -spin, we may consider U -spin breaking to leading order by evaluating\nZ\n \u0303\nhf |O(0)|\u0129i = hf |O(0)|ii + (\u2212i) d4 x hf |T [O(0)Hbreak (x)]|ii + . . . ,\n(2.3)\nwhere the states f \u0303 and \u0129 include the breaking term, while the states f and i are the U -spin symmetric\nstates. A general analysis of U -spin breaking can be perfomed by a group theory analysis of the\nbreaking term by decomposing the T product of the operator O with Hbreak into irreducible tensor\n(j)\noperators Tj3 of U -spin.\nThe simplest non-trivial case emerges if the operator O is an U -spin doublet, which we denote by\n(1/2)\nOj3 . In this case, the last term in (2.3) decomposes into\nZ\nZ\nh\ni\ni\nh\n(1/2)\n1/2\n(1)\n4\n4\n(\u2212i) d x T O\u00b11/2 (0)Hbreak (x) = (\u2212i\u000f) d x T O\u00b11/2 (0)B0 (x)\n#\nr \"\nr\n2\n1\n(3/2)\n(1/2)\n=\nK\u00b11/2 \u2213\nK\n.\n(2.4)\n3\n3 \u00b11/2\nAside from the trivial example of the currents j = \u016b\u0393q, q = d, s , also the effective weak hamiltonian for B decays is a pure U -spin doublet, even if electroweak penguins are included. The latter\nis true due to the fact that the s and the d quark carry the same electroweak quantum numbers. Thus\n\n2\n\n\ffrom the group theoretical point of view we may decompose the weak effective hamiltonian into its\nirreducible tensor components according to\n4GF\n\u221a\n2\n4GF\n= \u221a\n2\n\n\u2206C=\u00b11\nHeff\n=\n\u2206C=0\nHeff\n\n(1/2)\n\ni\nh\n(1/2)\n\u2217 (1/2)\n\u2217\nP\u22121/2 ,\nVcb Vud\nP1/2 + Vcb Vus\n\n(2.5)\n\nh\ni\n(1/2)\n(1/2)\n\u2217 (1/2)\n\u2217 (1/2)\nVcb Vcd\u2217 Q1/2 + Vub Vud\nR1/2 + Vcb Vcs\u2217 Q\u22121/2 + Vub Vus\nR\u22121/2 ,\n\n(2.6)\n\n(1/2)\n\n(1/2)\n\nwhere the operators Pj3 , Qj3 , and Rj3 are renormalization group invariant combinations of\nfour-quark operators.\nIn the following we shall use this group theoretical decomposition to discuss U -spin and its breaking in various B decays. To this end, we have to identify the U -spin multiplets of hadronic states.\nStarting from the definition of the fundamental quark doublets (we use the same sign convention as\nin [9]),\n\"\n# \"\n#\n\"\n# \"\n#\n|di\n| 12 + 12 i\n|s\u0304i\n| 21 + 21 i\n=\n,\n=\n,\n(2.7)\n \u0304\n|si\n| 12 \u2212 12 i\n\u2212| 12 \u2212 12 i\n|di\nwe obtain for the decaying B mesons\n\"\nB + = (ub\u0304) = |0, 0 i ,\n\n|B 0 i = (db\u0304)\n|Bs i = (sb\u0304)\n\nThe mesons in the final state are in terms of U -spin\n\"\n|K + i = |(us\u0304) i\n \u0304\n|\u03c0 + i = (ud)\n\"\n|\u03c0 \u2212 i = \u2212 |(\u016bd) i\n|K \u2212 i = \u2212 |(\u016bs) i\n\uf8ee\n|K 0 i = |(s\u0304d) i\n\uf8ef \u221a\n \u0304\n\uf8f0 3/2 |\u03b78 i \u2212 1/2 |\u03c0 0 i = (s\u0304s \u2212 dd)\n \u0304\nK\u0304 0 = (ds)\n\uf8ee\n|K \u22170 i = |(s\u0304d) i\n\uf8ef \u221a\n \u0304\n\uf8f0 1/ 2 |\u03c6 i \u2212 1/2 |\u03c10 i \u2212 1/2 |\u03c9 i = (s\u0304s \u2212 dd)\n \u0304\nK\u0304 \u22170 = (ds)\n\n#\n\n\"\n\n1\n, + 21\n2\n1\n, \u2212 21\n2\n\n=\n\n#\n\n#\n\n\"\n=\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\n.\n\n#\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n1\n, + 12\n2\n1\n, \u2212 12\n2\n\n#\n\n,\n\n(2.9)\n\n,\n\n(2.10)\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n|1, +1 i\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n= \uf8f0 |1, 0 i \uf8fb ,\n\u2212 |1, \u22121 i\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n|1, +1 i\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n= \uf8f0 |1, 0 i \uf8fb .\n\u2212 |1, \u22121 i\n\nFrom this we derive the decomposition of the neutral states\n\u221a\n1\n3\n0\n\u03c0\n= \u2212 |1, 0 i +\n|0, 0 i8 ,\nr2\n\u221a2\n1\n2\n2\n|\u03b7 i\n=\n|1, 0 i +\n|0, 0 i8 \u2212 |0, 0 i1 ,\n3\n3\n3\n\u221a\n1\n1\n2 2\n\u221a |1, 0 i + |0, 0 i8 +\n|\u03b7 0 i\n=\n|0, 0 i1 ,\n6\n3\n2 3\n\n3\n\n(2.8)\n\n1\n, + 12\n2\n1\n, \u2212 12\n2\n\n\"\n=\n\n#\n\n(2.11)\n\n(2.12)\n\n\f\u03c10\n\n=\n\n|\u03c9 i\n\n=\n\n|\u03c6 i\n\n=\n\n\u221a\n3\n1\n|0, 0 i8 ,\n\u2212 |1, 0 i +\n2\nr\n\u221a2\n1\n3\n2\n|0, 0 i8 +\n|0, 0 i1 ,\n\u2212 |1, 0 i \u2212\n2\n6\n3\n1\n1\n1\n\u221a |1, 0 i + \u221a |0, 0 i8 + \u221a |0, 0 i1 ,\n2\n6\n3\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere the subscript 1, 8 on the two U -spin singlet states refers to the SU (3) transformation properties\nof the corresponding state.\nIt is interesting to note that one may infer some relations in the U -spin limit. These have been\ndiscussed in the literatue [5, 14], but are rederived here in a different way. The key observation is that\ndue to CKM unitarity all CP violation in the standard model is proportional to the Jarlskog invariant\nIm\u2206 = Im(Vcb Vcd\u2217 Vub\u2217 Vud ) = \u2212Im(Vcb Vcs\u2217 Vub\u2217 Vus ) .\n\n(2.14)\n\nIn particular, all CP violating rate differences \u2206\u0393 = \u0393(B \u2192 f ) \u2212 \u0393(B \u2192 f ) are proportional to\nIm\u2206. Exchanging the roles of the d and the s quark will flip the sign of Im\u2206 in \u2206\u0393 as can bee seen\nin (2.14).\nThe relation (2.14) may be combined with the group theory of U -spin. We note that we have for\nthe operators in the effective hamiltonian\nh\ni\nh\ni\n(1/2)\n(1/2)\n(1/2)\n(1/2)\nU\u00b1 , Q\u22131/2 = Q\u00b11/2 ,\nU\u00b1 , P\u22131/2 = P\u00b11/2 ,\n(2.15)\nwhere U\u00b1 is the operator which raises or lowers the 3-component of the U -spin by one unit, respectively.\nFor the case of charged B mesons we have a U -spin singlet in the initial state, and hence the final\nstates may only have U = 1/2. Using (2.15) we see that\n(1/2)\n\n(1/2)\n\nhB + |Q\u22121/2 |f, 1/2i = hB + |Q+1/2 |f, \u22121/2i ,\n\n(2.16)\n\n(1/2)\n\nand the analogous relation for the matrix elements of PM . In the effective hamiltonian these matrix\nelements appear with CKM factors in which the role of the s and d quarks are interchanged and hence\nwe get in he U -spin limit\n\u2206\u0393(B + \u2192 (f, U3 = 1/2)) = \u2212\u2206\u0393(B + \u2192 (f, U3 = \u22121/2))\n\n(2.17)\n\nfor any state f .\nThe neutral B mesons form a U -spin doublet, and hence the possible final states can be either a\nsinglet or a triplet. Using the above reasoning, we infer the relation\n\u2206\u0393(Bd \u2192 (f, U = 0, U3 = 0)) = \u2212\u2206\u0393(Bs \u2192 (f, U = 0, U3 = 0)) .\n\n(2.18)\n\nFinally, the case of a triplet final state yields also similar relations for the U3 = \u00b11 components.\nUsing again (2.15) we get\n\u2206\u0393(Bd \u2192 (f, U = 1, U3 = 1)) = \u2212\u2206\u0393(Bs \u2192 (f, U = 1, U3 = \u22121)) .\n4\n\n(2.19)\n\n\fThese relations may serve as a test for the amount of U -spin breaking. In fact, rewriting the\nrelation for the rate differences into the usual observables we get\nACP (#1)\n\u0393(#2)\n=\u2212\n,\nACP (#2)\n\u0393(#1)\n\n(2.20)\n\nwhich we shall check once we will discuss applications. However, one has to keep in mind, that these\nrelations also reduce the number of independent observables.\nFinally we remark that we can supplement the U -spin relations by isospin symmetry. As pointed\nout above, we consider it safe to use isospin as an exact symmetry in this context and use this to\nconstrain the U -spin breaking parameters. The fundamental doublets are defined as\n\"\n# \"\n#\n\"\n# \"\n#\n \u0304\n|ui\n| 21 + 12 i\n|di\n| 21 + 12 i\n=\n,\n=\n,\n(2.21)\n|di\n| 12 \u2212 12 i\n|\u016bi\n\u2212| 12 \u2212 12 i\nI\n\nI\n\nwhich fixes our conventions.\nHowever, under isospin the effective hamiltonian decomposes in a more complicated way. The\n(1/2)\ntransformation properties of the operators defined in (2.5) are given in table 1. Note that for the Q\u00b11/2\noperators the only topology contributing with \u2206I = 1, 3/2 respectively is the electroweak penguin.\n\nOperator\n\n(\u2206I, \u2206Iz )\n\n\u2206C = 1 :\n(1/2)\nP+1/2\n(1/2)\nP\u22121/2\n\n(1, \u22121)\n(1/2, \u22121/2)\n\n\u2206C = 0, b \u2192 d\n(1/2)\nQ+1/2\n(1/2, \u22121/2) \u2295 (3/2, \u22121/2)\n(1/2)\nR+1/2\n(1/2, \u22121/2) \u2295 (3/2, \u22121/2)\n\u2206C = 0, b \u2192 s\n(1/2)\nQ\u22121/2\n(1/2)\nR\u22121/2\n\n(0, 0) \u2295 (1, 0)\n(0, 0) \u2295 (1, 0)\n\nTable 1: Classification of irreducible U -spin operators in terms of isospin.\n\n3\n\nApplications\n\nIn this section we apply the above formalism to non-leptonic two-body B decays. Clearly we shall\nnot discuss all possible decays here, rather we focus on two sample applications to check how far we\ncan get without any restrictive ad-hoc assumptions.\nAs stated above, the charged B mesons are U -spin singlets and hence - due to the simple U -spin\nstructure of the effective hamiltonian - the final state has to be a doublet or - including U -spin breaking\n5\n\n\f- a quadruplet. Considering two-body decays, this corresponds to having one final-state meson in a\nU -spin doublet, while the other has to be either U -spin singlet or triplet.\nIn the case where one of the final state mesons is in a triplet there is another complication. Since\nU -spin breaking is not that small, the mass eigenstates are quite different from the U -spin eigenstates,\ni.e. there is not even an approximate mass eigenstate corresponding to an ss\u0304 \u2212 dd \u0304 U -spin state. As\nalready described above (see (2.9) ff.), there are three mass eigenstates contributing to Uz = 0, which\nall have to be taken into account.\nThe two neutral B mesons form a doublet under U -spin. In the U -spin limit the contributing final\nstates have to form either a singlet or a triplet, while we can have also admixtures of U = 2 once\nwe include U -spin breaking. When considering two-body decays there are in total three possibilities.\nThe decays into two charged final states necessarily have either U = 0 or U = 1, since the charged\nmesons form U -spin doublets. The neutral mesons form either U -spin singlets or triplets, in which\ncase the two-body final states can have U = 0, 1 and 2. Clearly a final state with U = 2 can be\nreached only through U -spin breaking.\nIn the following we discuss the general possibilities to constrain U -spin breaking. Evidently the\ndata on Bs decays is needed which will be available in the near future from LHC data. However, based\non the current data one may already discuss U -spin breaking in some modes, e.g. B \u2192 J/\u03c8 (K or \u03c0)\n(charged and neutral) and in the decays B \u00b1 \u2192 D (K \u00b1 or \u03c0 \u00b1 ).\nAs will become apparent in these example analyses, the precision of the data does not yet suffice\nto draw strong conclusions. For some modes, this may change with LHCb, however, the modes\nincluding neutral light mesons in the final states will only be accessible with a sufficient precision at\na super flavour factory. In general, the parameters appearing in our expressions can be constrained\nmeaningfully in the relevant range with the expected precision from future experiments. We have\nchecked this by performing some sample fits within a simple \"future scenario\". The details, however,\ndepend strongly on the mode, and in some cases one still has to resolve discrete ambiguities.\n\n3.1\n\nU-Spin Breaking in B \u2192 M0 M0 and in B \u2192 CP-Eigenstates\n\nWhen considering decays of neutral B mesons into two neutral mesons, one has to deal with admixtures of U -spin multiplets.

Doing this in full generality\nleads to a large number of independent U -spin amplitudes for Uz = 0 final states already in the\nsymmetry limit, and does in general not allow for a determination of all breaking amplitudes. One\ntheoretical exception is given by decays B 0 \u2192 P 0 P 0 : when both final state particles belong to the\nsame multiplet, Bose symmetry forbids antisymmetric final states, leading to a reduction of possible\namplitudes1 . However, this possibility remains a theoretical one, because in order to perform this fit,\nall decays of this class would have to be measured time-dependently, which seems not possible in the\nnear future.\nChoosing the subset of decays formed by b \u2192 s transitions of Bd -mesons, combined with b \u2192 d\ntransitions of Bs -mesons [9] results in 19 parameters facing up to 18 observables, therefore in this\ncase one additional assumption is needed.\nIn any case, the current situation concerning the data is insufficient to perform such an analysis,\nsince the Bs system has not been fully explored yet. Clearly with the advent of LHC this situation\nwill change once LHCb measures the decay rates and the CP asymmetries of the corresponding Bs\ntransitions.\nDecays into CP eigenstates (or, more generally, states which are not flavour-specific) play an\nexceptional role, because of the additional information coming from time-dependent measurements.\nEach of these decays forms a subset with its U -spin partner formed by exchanging all down and\nstrange quarks in the process, because they have effectively only one amplitude. These subsets can\nbe discussed separately from the rest of the corresponding class, which allows for fits with a small\nnumber of parameters, even when other decays of that class have not been measured yet. This feature\nhas been extensively exploited in the U -spin limit, or including factorizable U -spin breaking only (see\ne.g. [5, 14]). In that case, the two decays in question have five independent observables (because of\nrelation (2.20)), but only three parameters, so a fit for up to two weak phases is possible. However,\nthese determinations suffer from the systematic uncertainty related to U -spin breaking.\nIncluding the breaking corrections to first order for these subsets, one observes that the breaking\namplitudes form only one effective breaking amplitude as well. However, again this does not suffice\nfor an analysis of the breaking which is completely free from additional assumptions: the number of\nparameters increases by four, while only one additional independent observable becomes available.\nIn these cases, for example the following two strategies may be used:\n\u2022 If one amplitude is clearly dominating (|A1 /A2 | \u223c \u03b4), one may consider the U -spin breaking\n1\n\nThis fact has been overlooked in [9], the corrections to the corresponding decompositions are straight forward.\n\n7\n\n\ffor the leading amplitude only, neglecting only terms of order (O(\u000f2 ), O(\u000f\u03b4)). This is for ex+\n\u2212\nample the case in B \u2192 Dd,s\nDd,s\ndecays, which are dominated by their colour allowed tree\ncontribution.\n\u2022 If one of the two parts in the leading amplitude is dominated by a colour allowed tree contribution, one may use the factorization assumption for that part only, as opposed to using it for the\nwhole amplitude, and fit for the breaking amplitude in the other part.\nIn both cases, the number of free parameters increases only by two, so in principle a fit becomes\npossible; in addition, as one additional observable is available, one may determine that way one of the\nweak phases with correspondingly smaller systematic uncertainty. If for one class of decays the whole\nset is measured, these strategies may be used with the whole set, so the decays into flavour-specific\nmodes can be included.\nFinally, let us comment on the phenomenologically important decays Bd,s \u2192 (\u03c0/K)+ (\u03c0/K)\u2212 ,\nof which a subsection are CP eigenstates. A priori, both strategies are not applicable in this case.\nHowever, there exists a small amplitude combination, corresponding to the fact that the amplitudes for\nBd \u2192 K + K \u2212 and Bs \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 are \"dynamically suppressed\", i.e. they proceed only via annihilation.\nThis fact might be used by setting to zero the corrections to this amplitude combination with \u2206I =\n1/2, thereby reducing the number of parameters to 15, while there are in principle 16 measurements\navailable from these decays. However, a fit still requires the time-dependent measurements of all\nthese decays. At the moment, there is no sign of large U -spin breaking in these decays [15].\n\n3.2\n\nThe decays B \u2192 J/\u03c8 (K or \u03c0)\n\nThe decays B \u2192 J/\u03c8 (K or \u03c0) are under the simplest cases of \u2206C = 0 from the group theoretical\npoint of view, because of J/\u03c8 and B \u2212 being U -spin singlets. Our analysis is based on the data shown\nin tables 2 and 3. As a first step, we check for U -spin violation by testing the U -spin relation (2.20).\n\nDecay\nB \u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8K \u2212\nB \u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 \u2212\n\nBR/10\u22124\n10.07 \u00b1 0.35\n0.49 \u00b1 0.06(\u2217)\n\nACP\n0.017 \u00b1 0.016(\u2217)\n0.09 \u00b1 0.08\n\nTable 2: Measurements for the decays B \u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8(K or \u03c0), data taken from the PDG [16].

This result is not significant and a real test may only be performed,\nif at least one of the asymmetries is measured significantly different from zero.\n8\n\n\fIn many applications naive factorization has been applied, which allows to include at least the\nfactorizable part of U -spin breaking. In this picture one expects the ratio of branching ratios to be\ngiven only in terms of CKM factors and the ratio of form factors. One gets the theoretical prediction\nBR(B \u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8K \u2212 )\n\u223c\nBR(B \u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 \u2212 )\n\n2\nF B\u2192K (MJ/\u03c8\n)\n2\n)\nF B\u2192\u03c0 (MJ/\u03c8\n\n!2\n\nVcb\u2217 Vcs\nVcb\u2217 Vcd\n\n2\n\n= 33.9 \u00b1 6.1 ,\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere the form factor ratio is taken from QCD sum rule calculations [17] and scaled to q 2 = m2J/\u03c8\nwith aid of a simple BK ansatz [18].

Hence some additional assumptions are necessary. We shall assume the following:\n\u2217\nis expected to be small compared to the one\n\u2022 The amplitude proportional to \u03bbud/s = Vub Vud/s\n\u2217\nproportional to \u03bbcd/s = Vcb Vcd/s , because its tree operator contribution has only penguin matrix\nelements. Hence we will not take into account U -spin breaking for this amplitude.\n\n\u2022 We shall also make use of isospin symmetry. This means that we have to take into account also\nthe decays of the neutral B modes, since they are the isospin partners of the charged B mesons.\nWhen making use of isospin, the matrix elements identified in the U -spin analysis are splitted\ninto their two isospin components as shown in table 1. Here we neglect the contribution with\n\u2206I = 1, 3/2 proportional to \u03bbcs/d , which receive contributions from penguin matrix elements of\nelectroweak penguin operators only; hence we assume the corresponding penguin contributions\nto be a pure \u2206I = 0, 1/2 amplitude for both the b \u2192 s and b \u2192 d transition.\n\nDecay\n0\nB\u0304 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K\u0304 0\nB\u0304 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 0\n\nBR/10\u22124\n8.71 \u00b1 0.32\n0.205 \u00b1 0.024\n\nACP\nSCP\n\u22120.002 \u00b1 0.020(\u2217)\n0.657 \u00b1 0.025\n0.10 \u00b1 0.13\n\u22120.93 \u00b1 0.29(\u2217\u2217)\n\nTable 3: Measurements for the decays B\u0304 \u2192 J/\u03c8(K or \u03c0).

As a consequence,\nthe corresponding ratios of lifetimes and phase space factors have to be taken into account when\ncomputing the branching ratios from (3.8) for the other decays. Furthermore, the ratios r0 , r1K and\n\u03c0\nare the penguin and u quark tree contributions (normalized to NJ/\u03c8K ) respectively, which contain\nr3/2\n\u2217\na factor Ru = |Vub Vud\n/Vcb Vcd\u2217 |. Finally, the complex parameter x\u000f represents the U -spin breaking part\nin the leading contribution, again normalized to NJ/\u03c8K . As inputs from the CKM fit we use, in\naddition to the ones described above, those from table 4.

The fit shows three\ndistinct solutions, two of which have \u03c60 \u223c 0, while the third one has \u03c60 \u223c \u03c0. As the solutions interfere\nin the fit and make it unstable, we perform two separate fits with the restrictions \u03c60 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2]\nand \u03c60 \u2208 [\u03c0/2, 3\u03c0/2], covering the whole parameter space.\nThe sizable difference between the branching ratios of the charged and the neutral B \u2192 J/\u03c8K\nmodes is somewhat surprising. The isospin analysis shows that it is driven by the \u2206I = 1 contribution of the effective hamiltonian, which is doubly CKM suppressed. Hence the ratio between these\nbranching ratios should be given by the ratio of lifetimes which is close to unity, modified only by\na doubly Cabbibo suppressed tree contribution and electroweak penguins. In our fit, this results in\nr1K \u223c 1(\u2265 0.78@1\u03c3), which is quite large, but on the other hand not conclusive at the moment.

Note that they are consistent\nwith zero at the 1- and 2-sigma level respectively.\nWe observe that the data are only roughly consistent with relations (3.14), within two standard\ndeviations. In addition, using relations (3.15), one observes that while the data for B \u2192 DK seems\nreasonable, the data for B \u2192 D\u03c0 prefer a vanishing colour-suppressed amplitude by giving a negative\ncentral values for it. While this is on one hand sensible, because this amplitude is expected to be\nsmall, it is at odds with the measured non-vanishing CP-asymmetries.

Data for B \u2192 D\u00b1 K is taken from the HFAG [19],\nthe rest from the PDG [16]. (\u2217): Error rescaled by the PDG, due to inconsistent measurements.\n\nChecking now in a next step for U -spin breaking by evaluating relations (3.16), we find good\n0\n0\nagreement in case of the data for B \u2192 D\u2212\n(K or \u03c0), while the relation for the D+\ndata shows significant U -spin violation, because both CP asymmetries are significantly different from zero and have\nthe same sign. Therefore we expect non-vanishing U -spin breaking parameters in the corresponding\nfit.\nIt is interesting to note that for the colour allowed tree decays one may check again naive factorization. In this case the U -spin breaking is given by the ratio of the decay constants, i.e.\n\u0012\n\u0013\nhB \u2212 |Hef f |D0 K \u2212 i\n\u03bb\n1 + y1,\u000f ei\u03b81\n\u03bb fK\n=\n'\n\u223c 0.28 .\n(3.20)\n2\n2\n\u2212\n0\n\u2212\ni\u03b8\n\u03bb\n1\nhB |Hef f |D \u03c0 i\n1 \u2212 2 1 \u2212 y1,\u000f e\n1 \u2212 \u03bb2 f\u03c0\n14\n\n\fIn this approach we obtain \u03b81 = 0 and y1,\u000f \u223c 0.1 from the ratio of the decay constants. The comparison with experiment (see table 6),\ns\nBR(B \u2212 \u2192 D0 K \u2212 )\n= 0.276 \u00b1 0.011 ,\n(3.21)\nBR(B \u2212 \u2192 D0 \u03c0 \u2212 )\nshows excellent agreement, indicating the well known fact that naive factorization works reasonably\nwell in colour-allowed tree decays.\nOne may use this observation to fix \u03b81 \u2261 0, thereby breaking the parametric invariances described\nabove. This results in \u03c72 /d.o.f. = 7.42/4, but mostly independent of the assumption concerning\nU -spin breaking, corresponding to the above discussion. While the results are therefore to be handled\nwith care, we note that the fit prefers large values U -spin breaking parameter r2 , and leads to the\npredictions BR(B \u2212 \u2192 D\u03040 K \u2212 ) \u2208 [0.02, 0.09] \u00d7 10\u22124 and BR(B \u2212 \u2192 D\u03040 \u03c0 \u2212 ) \u2264 0.03 \u00d7 10\u22124 at 1\u03c3.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nSince methods based on factorization do not seem to converge quickly to allow for a reliable prediction for non-leptonic decays, the method of flavour symmetries looks more promising. Clearly\nthe latter will allow us to perform precision calculations only if we get a reasonable control over\nsymmetry breaking.\nUsing the full SU (3) flavour symmetry becomes quite complicated once its complete breaking is\ntaken into account. However, the isospin subgroup of full SU (3) may be assumed to be a reasonably\ngood symmetry and hence only the breaking along the \"orthogonal\" directions in SU (3) space has to\nbe considered.\nWe have studied the U -spin subgroup of SU (3), which has the advantage that the charge operator\ncommutes with the symmetry generators and hence also the weak hamiltonian for B decays has a\nsimple structure under this symmetry. The breaking term is due to the mass difference between the\ndown and the strange quark and has a simple structure inferred from QCD.\nBased on this we have discussed how U -spin breaking can be incorporated on a purely group\ntheoretical basis. We have shown a few applications, in which the U -spin breaking tuns out roughly\nof the order implied by the difference in the decay constants f\u03c0 and fK .\nHowever, the full strength of this strategy can be exploited only in the future. Since the Bd and the\nBs form a U -spin doublet, the approach requires information on decay modes which will be gathered\nin the near future at the LHC. With a sufficient amount of data there will be a chance to obtain control\nover flavour SU (3) breaking and hence a possible road to precise predictions for non-leptonic decays\nmay be opened.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the german research foundation DFG under\ncontracts no.
