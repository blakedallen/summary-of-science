Introduction\nIn this note we prove that the q-Gaussian distribution introduced by\nBo\u017cejko and Speicher in [10] (see also the paper [9] of Bo\u017cejko, K\u00fcmmerer and\nSpeicher) is freely infinitely divisible when q \u2208 [0, 1].\nWe shall give a short outline for the context of this problem. In probability theory, the class of infinitely divisible distributions plays a crucial role, in\nthe study of limit theorems, L\u00e9vy processes etc. So it was a remarkable discovery\nof Bercovici and Voiculescu [6] that there exists a corresponding class of freely infinitely divisible distributions in free probability. These distributions are typically\nquite different from the classically infinitely divisible ones; for example, many of\nthem are compactly supported. Nevertheless, work of numerous authors culminating in the paper by [5] Bercovici and Pata showed that free ID distributions are in\na precise bijection with the classical ones, this bijection moreover having numerous strong properties. For example, the semicircular law is the free analog of the\nnormal distribution. From this bijection, one might get the intuition that, perhaps\nwith very rare exceptions such as the Cauchy and Dirac distributions, some measures belong to the \"classical\" world and some to the \"free\" world. However, [4,\nCorollary 3.9] indicates that this intuition may be misleading: the normal distribution, perhaps the most important among the classical ones, is also freely infinitely\ndivisible.\nOne approach towards understanding the relationship between the classical and free probability theories, and in particular the Bercovici-Pata bijection,\nhave been attempts to construct an interpolation between these two theories. The\noldest such construction, due to Bo\u017cejko and Speicher, is the construction of the\nq-Brownian motion. In particular, it provides a probabilistic interpretation for a\n(very classical) family of q-Gaussian distributions, which interpolate between the\nnormal (q = 1) and the semicircle (q = 0) laws. Probably the best known description of the q-Gaussian distributions is in terms of their orthogonal polynomials\nHn (x|q) - called the q-Hermite polynomials - defined by the 3-term recurrence relan\ntion xHn (x|q) = Hn+1 (x|q) + 1\u2212q\n1\u2212q Hn\u22121 (x|q), with initial conditions H0 (x|q) = 1,\nDate: October 27, 2018.\nWork of M.

LEHNER\n\nH1 (x|q) = x. These polynomials have been studied for a long time: probably\ntheir first appearance under this guise occurred in L. J. Rogers' 1893 paper [24].\nBo\u017cejko and Speicher construct their example of q-Brownian motion using creationannihilation operators on a \"twisted\" Fock space: given a separable Hilbert space\nH and f \u2208 H, we let c\u2217 (f ) be the left creation operator on the Fock space F(H)\nand c(f ) be its adjoint. The authors provide in [10] a scalar product ( * | * )q on (a\nquotient space of) F(H) for which the so-called q-canonical commutation relation\nholds:\nc(f )c\u2217 (g) \u2212 qc\u2217 (g)c(f ) = (f |g)q 1,\n\nf, g \u2208 H,\n\nwhere 1 is the identity operator on F(H). It is a fundamental result that, when\n(f |f )q = 1, the distribution of the self-adjoint operator c(f ) + c\u2217 (f ) with respect\nto the vacuum state on F(H) is the (centered) q-Gaussian distribution of variance one, having the q-Hermite polynomials as orthogonal polynomials (see [9,\nTheorem 1.10]). In this case, as mentioned before, when q = 1, c(f ) + c\u2217 (f ) is\ndistributed according to the classical normal distribution (2\u03c0)\u22121/2 exp(t2 /2)dt, and\nwhen q\u221a\n= 0 according to the free central limit - the Wigner distribution with density\n(2\u03c0)\u22121 4 \u2212 t2 \u03c7[\u22122,2] (t). A formula for the density fq of the q-Gaussian distribuQ\u221e\n\u221a\ntion is provided\nin [19]: fq (x) = \u03c0 \u22121 1 \u2212 q sin \u03b8 n=1 (1 \u2212 q)n |1 \u2212 q n e2i\u03b8 |2 , where\n\u221a\ncos \u03b8 = x2 1 \u2212 q. The interested reader might want to note [19, Section III] that,\nup to a multiplicative constant depending only on q, fq is a theta function. For\nnumerous details on properties and applications of q-Gaussian processes we refer\nto [9] and references therein.\nAs the construction described above suggests, q-Gaussians provide useful\nexamples in operator algebras. The von Neumann algebras generated by families of\nq-Gaussians are shown to exhibit several interesting properties, and we shall list a\nfew below; however, the structure of these algebras still remains largely mysterious.\nIt is shown in [21] that algebras generated by such families when f runs through H\nand dim(H) \u2265 2 are non-injective; the paper [23] proves that algebras generated by\nat least two q-Gaussians corresponding to orthogonal f s are always factors when\n|q| < 1 (see also [15, 9, 26]), and in [25] Shlyakhtenko provides estimates for the nonmicrostates free entropy of n-tuples of such q-Gaussians, estimates which guarantee\n\u221a\nthat the algebra they generate is solid in the sense of Ozawa whenever q < 2 \u2212 1.\nMoreover, recently Bo\u017cejko [8] proved that in von Neumann algebras generated by\ntwo q-Gaussians, the Bessis-Moussa-Villani conjecture holds.\nThere are several strictly probabilistic approaches to q-Gaussians: we\nwould like to mention the stochastic integration with respect to q-Brownian motion\nof Donati-Martin [14], the q-deformed cumulants, a q-convolution defined on a\nrestricted class of probability measures and q-Poisson processes studied in [2] and\na random matrix model provided in [18].\nHowever, classical or free probability aspects of q-Gaussians have been\nless studied. In this paper, we show that all of these distributions, for 0 \u2264 q \u2264 1, are\nfreely infinitely divisible. This may be an indication that the class of freely infinitely divisible distributions, despite the Bercovici-Pata bijection, is quite different\nfrom the classical one, and is yet to be understood completely. The conjecture\nthat q-Gaussian distributions are freely infinitely divisible when q \u2208 [0, 1], formulated initially by the two last named authors and R. Speicher, was motivated\namong others by the recently proved free infinite divisibility of the classical Gaussian (corresponding to q = 1). It has been shown in [4] that the Askey-Wimp-Kerov\n\n\fFREE INFINITE DIVISIBILITY FOR Q-GAUSSIANS\n\n3\n\ndistributions with parameter c \u2208 [\u22121, 0], and in particular the classical normal distribution (corresponding to c = 0) are \u0001-infinitely divisible. This provided free\ninfinite divisibility for distributions of several noncommutative Brownian motions\n(see for example [11, 12, 13]), interpolating between the classical central limit (the\nnormal distribution) and the free central limit (the Wigner semicircle law). However, until now it remained a mystery whether this first (and most famous) such\nexample of interpolation consists also of \u0001-infinitely divisible distributions. Several\nnumerical verifications performed by one of us seemed to indicate this is indeed the\ncase. Here we shall give an answer to this question:\nTheorem 1. The q-Gaussian distribution fq (x)dx is freely infinitely divisible for\nall q \u2208 [0, 1].\nOur method to prove this result will be the same as in [4], namely we will\nconstruct an inverse to the Cauchy transform Gfq of the q-Gaussian defined on the\nwhole lower half-plane. Then the Voiculescu transform \u03c6fq (1/z) = G\u22121\nfq (z) \u2212 (1/z)\n+\nclearly has an extension to the whole complex upper half-plane C . An application\nof the following theorem of Bercovici and Voiculescu from [6] yields the desired\nresult:\nTheorem 2. A Borel probability measure \u03bc on the real line is \u0001-infinitely divisible if and only if its Voiculescu transform \u03c6\u03bc (z) extends to an analytic function\n\u03c6 \u03bc : C+ \u2192 C \u2212 .\nThe paper is organized as follows: in the second section, we introduce\nseveral notions and preliminary results used in our proof, and in the third section\nwe give the proof of Theorem 1.\nAcknowledgements. We would like to thank Roland Speicher for many useful\ndiscussions regarding this paper.\n2. Preliminary results: the importance of an entire function\nIt is shown in the paper [27] of Pawel Szablowski (see also [17]) that the\ndensity of the q-Gaussian distribution of mean zero and variance one, with respect\nto the Lebesgue measure is given by the formula\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u221a\n\u221a\n\u221e\nX\nk(k\u22121)\n1 \u2212 qp\nx 1\u2212q\n4 \u2212 (1 \u2212 q)x2\n(\u22121)k\u22121 q 2 U2k\u22122\n,\nfq (x) =\n2\u03c0\n2\nk=1\n\u221a\nfor |x| \u2264 2/ 1 \u2212 q, where Uk is the k th Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind defined by the relation Uk (cos \u03b8) = sin((k+1)\u03b8)\n. In our present paper we will consider\nsin \u03b8\nthis as being the definition of the q-Gaussian distribution.For simplicity of notation,\nwe\u221awill re-normalize this density to being supported on [\u22122, 2], by replacing x with\nx/ 1 \u2212 q :\n\u221e\n\u0010x\u0011\nX\nk(k\u22121)\n1 p\nfq (x) =\n4 \u2212 x2\n(\u22121)k\u22121 q 2 U2k\u22122\n, \u22122 \u2264 x \u2264 2.\n2\u03c0\n2\nk=1\n\nRecall that the Cauchy (or Cauchy-Stieltjes) transform of a Borel probability measure \u03bc on R is by definition\nZ\n1\nG\u03bc (z) =\nd\u03bc(x), z \u2208 C \\ R.\nz\n\u2212\nx\nR\n\n\f4\n\nM.

Assume that an entire analytic function h has order zero. Then the\npreimage h\u22121 (l) of any piecewise smooth curve l with both ends at infinity has all\nits ends tend to infinity and for any component \u03b3 of h\u22121 (l), we have h(\u03b3) = l.\nProof. It is clear from Theorem 5 and the definition of an entire function that the\npreimage of any curve with both ends at infinity cannot have an end in the complex\nplane.\nOn the other hand, by the Denjoy-Carleman-Ahlfors Theorem (Theorem\n4), we know that there is no path \u03b3 going to infinity so that the limit of h along\n\u03b3 is finite. If we assume that there is a branch \u03b3 of h\u22121 (l) so that h(\u03b3) 6= l, then\nthere exists a complex number c \u2208 l which is an asymptotic value for h at infinity,\ncontradicting Theorem 4.\n\u0003\nLemma 8.\n(a) If \u03b3 is the boundary of a simply connected domain D in C, \u03b3\nhas both ends at infinity, and h(\u03b3) = R, then either h(D) is one of the\ndomains C+ , C\u2212 , or h(D) = C.\n(b) If h(\u2202D) is a half-line s in C, then h(D) \u2287 C \\ s.\nProof. As seen in Theorem 5, \u2202h(D) \u2286 h(\u03b3) = R. It is clear that if h(D) is not a\nhalf-plane, then its closure must be all of C. This proves (a). The proof of (b) is\nidentical: \u2202h(D) \u2286 h(\u2202D) = s, so h(D) \u2287 C \\ s.\n\u0003\nLemma 9. With the notations from the previous lemma, if \u03b3 is a rectifiable path,\nh(D) = C+ , and h is injective on \u03b3, then h maps D conformally onto C+ .\nProof. This lemma is a direct consequence of [22], Chapters 1 and 2.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fFREE INFINITE DIVISIBILITY FOR Q-GAUSSIANS\n\n7\n\n3. Proof of free infinite divisibility for fq (x)dx\nWe are now ready to prove the main result. For the comfort of the reader,\nwe restate our main Theorem 1 below.\nTheorem 1. The q-Gaussian distribution fq (x)dx is freely infinitely divisible for\nall q \u2208 [0, 1].\nProof. In our proof, we will follow the outline described in the introduction. Namely,\nwe will find a domain Xq in the lower half-plane containing the lower half of the\nunit disc D with the property that gq (Xq ) = C\u2212 and gq is injective on Xq . Since\nwe have shown that Gs maps C+ \u222a R injectively into the closure of the lower half\nof the unit disc and (when considering the correct extension through (\u22122, 2)) C\u2212\n\u22121\n\u22121\nextends to C\u2212 . Thus,\ninjectively into C\u2212 \\ D, it will follow that G\u22121\nfq = Gs \u25e6 gq\nFfq (*) =\n\n1\n+\n: G\u22121\ns (Xq ) 7\u2192 C\ngq (Gs (*))\n\nis the\nis a bijective correspondence. (The reader should keep in mind that G\u22121\ns\n+\n(X\n)\n\u2283\nC\n.)\nSince\nXq is\ninverse of the extension of Gs |C+ through (\u22122, 2), so G\u22121\nq\ns\nincluded in the lower half-plane, the choice of the extension of Gs guarantee that\n\u22121\nG\u22121\ns (Xq ) \u2229 R = (\u22122, 2). This implies the existence of \u03c6fq (z) = Ffq (z) \u2212 z for\nall z \u2208 C+ . Recalling now that =Ffq (w) > =w for all w \u2208 C+ , we obtain that\n\u22121\n=Ffq (w) > =w for all w \u2208 G\u22121\ns (Xq ), and hence =\u03c6fq (z) = =Ffq (z) \u2212 =z < 0 for\n+\nall z \u2208 C . An application of Theorem 2 yields the desired conclusion.\nFirst, remark that, since gq0 (0) = 1, for any fixed q \u2208 (0, 1) there exist\ntwo constants Kq , Mq > 0 so that gq is injective on Kq D and gq (Kq D) \u2283 Mq D.\nNext, we shall construct the domain Xq described in the first paragraph\nof the proof. Since gq (z) = \u2212gq (\u2212z) and gq (z) = gq (z), z \u2208 C, it will clearly be\nenough to find the right side of Xq , as Xq must be symmetric with respect to the\nimaginary axis. As suggested by the last lemma, we shall first find a continuous\nsimple path inside C\u2212 whose image via gq is the real line. We observe in addition\nthat, due to the symmetry noted in items (3), (4) and (5) in the above list of\nproperties of gq , it will be enough to determine the right half of such a path (see\nFigure 1.)\nWe start our path from zero. Let us now \"walk\" along the real axis, in\nthe positive direction (by item (3) above, it is enough if we cover the right half)\nuntil we encounter a zero of gq0 , call it dq . Clearly, gq ([0, dq ]) = [0, gq (dq )] is a\nbijective identification. Around dq , gq will be an n-to-one cover (where n is the\norder of the zero of gq (*) \u2212 gq (dq )), and we will choose the path \"first to the right\"\nwhich continues gq\u22121 ([0, gq (dq )]) beyond dq , to gq\u22121 ([0, +\u221e)). Observe that this\npath escapes now in the lower half-plane and, since gq (R) \u2286 R, it remains in the\nlower half-plane. Now whenever we meet another such critical point for gq on this\npath gq\u22121 ([0, +\u221e)), we turn again \"first to the right\", so that immediately to the\nright of this branch of gq\u22121 ([0, +\u221e)) of ours, gq is injective. Call this branch - which\nis a rectifiable, piecewise analytic path - \u03b3q . Observe moreover that, by item (5),\n\u03b3q is confined to the lower right quadrant of the complex plane (it cannot cut the\nimaginary axis, as the imaginary axis is mapped into itself).\nApriori it is not clear whether this branch of gq\u22121 ([0, +\u221e)) is in fact\nexisting, i.e. gq (\u03b3q ) = [0, +\u221e). However, as we have seen above, gq has order\n\n\f8\n\nM. ANSHELEVICH, S. T. BELINSCHI, M. BO\u017bEJKO, AND F. LEHNER\n\nzero, so by Lemma 7 (the application of the Denjoy-Carleman-Ahlfors Theorem),\ngq can have no finite asymptotic values at infinity, so indeed \u03b3q as above (i.e.\ngq (\u03b3q ) = [0, +\u221e)) exists. Thus \u03b3q \u222a (\u2212\u03b3q ) (here \u03b3 means complex conjugate,\nnot closure) forms the boundary of a unique simply connected domain Xq \u2286 C\u2212\nwhich contains the lower half of the imaginary axis and has a piecewise analytic,\neverywhere continuous, boundary. Clearly the lower half of the unit disc is included\nin Xq . Indeed, if \u03b3q \u2229 D 6= \u2205, then there exists z0 \u2208 C+ so that Gs (z0 ) \u2208 \u03b3q \u2229 D,\nand thus Gfq (z0 ) = gq (Gs (z0 )) \u2208 R, an obvious contradiction.\ngq\n\nGs\n\nD\n\nXq\n\n\u03b3q\n\nFigure 1. The curve \u03b3q is mapped by gq onto the real line. The\ndarker shadings correspond to each other via Gs , while gq maps\nthe entire shaded area (dark and light) onto the lower half-plane.\nFix now q \u2208 (0, 1). It is trivial that gq has a unique inverse, call it \u03a6,\ndefined around zero (more precise, at least on Mq D), which fixes zero. We would\nlike to extend this inverse to the whole lower half-plane; then it would easily follow\nthat \u03a6(C\u2212 ) = Xq . The lack of finite asymptotic values for gq guarantees that the\nonly impediment to such an analytic extension would be a finite critical value of\ngq . Thus, assume towards contradiction that there exists a c \u2208 Xq (for precision,\nassume <c > 0) so that gq0 (c) = 0. Without loss of generality we may assume\nthat gq (c) \u2208 C\u2212 and gq (c) is the point closest to the origin in the lower half-plane\nto which \u03a6 does not extend analytically. We consider a half-line r starting at\ngq (c) and going to infinity inside C\u2212 \u2229 iC\u2212 without cutting gq (c)D and so that no\nz \u2208 r \\ {gq (c)} is a critical value for gq (possible since the set of critical values of gq\nis at most countable). By the same Lemma 7, we conclude that r has a preimage\npq via gq inside Xq , right of the imaginary axis, with both ends at infinity, which\ndetermines a domain D \u2282 Xq that does not contain i(\u2212\u221e, 0) and having boundary\n\u2202D = pq . The choice for pq is made so that there is no other preimage in Xq \\ D\nof r which is in the same connected component of gq\u22121 (r) as pq .\nFor the sake of clarity, we group most of the rest of the proof in the\nfollowing lemma. The reader will probably find Figure 2 helpful in following it.\n1\n\nLemma 10.\n(1) There exists a point b \u2208 D, |b| > 1, so that gq (b) = 0.\n(2) For any m > |c| + |gq (c)| + 1 + |b|, there exists M \u2265 m and a path $ in D\nuniting the two points of pq \u2229 gq\u22121 (\u2202(M D)) so that gq ($) \u2229 mD = \u2205.\n(3) Let \u03a0m be the path obtained by concatenating $, the bounded part(s) of\npq \\ ($ \u222a D) and, if existing, the segments \u2202D \u2229 D. Then \u03a0m is a closed\ncurve containing b inside it and there exists m > 0 so that {gq (1/w) : w \u2208\n\u03a0m } \u2282 C+ and gq (\u03a0m ) \u2229 {gq (1/w) : w \u2208 \u03a0m } = \u2205.\n\n\fFREE INFINITE DIVISIBILITY FOR Q-GAUSSIANS\n\n9\n\n(4) In particular, w 7\u2192 gq (w) and w 7\u2192 gq (w) \u2212 gq (1/w) have the same number\nof zeros in the simply connected domain determined by the simple closed\ncurve \u03a0m .\nProof. Clearly, Lemma 8 guarantees that gq (D) \u2287 C \\ r, which contains zero.\nThus, there exists a point b \u2208 D so that gq (b) = 0. Moreover, let us recall that\nGfq = gq \u25e6 Gs is the Cauchy transform of a probability measure, and, as such, it\nmaps the upper half-plane into the lower one. Thus, as Gs (C+ \u222a [\u22122, 2]) = D \u2229 C\u2212 ,\nit follows that gq (w) 6= 0 for any w \u2208 D \u2229 C\u2212 , so b \u2208 C\u2212 \\ D, so in particular |b| > 1.\nThis proves (1).\nTo prove (2), recall that by Theorem 4 the set {z \u2208 C : |gq (z)| > m}\nis connected for any m \u2265 0 and in particular for m as in the statement of the\nlemma. Also, from the construction of r and pq , it is clear that pq \u2229 gq\u22121 (\u2202(M D))\ncontains exactly two points for any M \u2265 m. Assume now towards contradiction\nthat there is no path uniting those two points inside the set D \\ gq\u22121 (mD), and in\nparticular, of course, in D \\gq\u22121 (mD). Thus the open set gq\u22121 (mD)\u2229D must contain\nan unbounded smooth path. Choose such a path, and call it \u0393. Choose 0 < T =\n1+2 inf{|z| : z \u2208 \u0393} (so that \u0393\u2229T D 6= \u2205) and let M > 2 max{|gq (z)| : |z| \u2264 T }+m.\nSince gq (z) = gq (z), it follows that {z \u2208 C : |gq (z)| > M } does not intersect the\nset T D \u222a \u0393 \u222a \u0393 (here again \u0393 denotes complex conjugate, not closure). But this\nset disconnects C: for example, the set pq \u2229 {z \u2208 C : |gq (z)| > M } contains two\nnonempty connected components separated by T D\u222a\u0393\u222a\u0393. This contradicts Theorem\n4. Thus a path $ = $m as described in our lemma must exist.\nThe fact that \u03a0m exists and surrounds b exactly once is a trivial consequence of (1), (2) and the entireness of gq . Moreover, from \u03a0m 's construction,\nthe set {1/w : w \u2208 \u03a0m } \u2282 C+ \u2229 D. Thus, as noted in the proofs of (1) and (2),\n{gq (1/w) : w \u2208 \u03a0m } \u2282 gq (D \u2229 C+ ) \u2282 C+ (recall that gq (z) = gq (z)) is a bounded\nset for any m (one can choose the bound max gq (D), which is obviously independent\nof m and depends only on q). To finish the proof of (3) we only need to argue that\nfor m large enough, the set gq (\u03a0m ) does not intersect C+ \u2229 (max gq (D)D). Indeed,\nif we have a point z \u2208 pq , then gq (z) \u2208 r \u2282 C\u2212 , while if z \u2208 \u2202D \u2229 C\u2212 , then again\ngq (z) \u2208 C\u2212 . We only need to show that for m large enough $ = $m is mapped\nin the complement of max gq (D)D. However, this follows from part (2) by simply\nchoosing m \u2265 max gq (D). This proves (3).\nIn order to prove (4), we will apply Theorem 6 to f (z) = \u2212gq (z)+gq (1/z)\nand g(z) = gq (z). The relation |gq (z) + (\u2212gq (z) + gq (1/z))| < |gq (z) \u2212 gq (1/z)| +\n|gq (z)| is equivalent to\n\ngq (1/z)\ngq (z)\n\n<\n\ngq (z)\u2212gq (1/z)\ngq (z)\n\n+1 = 1\u2212\n\ngq (1/z)\ngq (z)\n\n+ 1, for z \u2208\n\n\u03a0m . Consider two cases: first, if z \u2208 $, then |gq (z)| > m > |gq (1/z)|, so that\ngq (1/z)\ngq (z)\n\n\u22121 < 0 < 1\u2212\n\ngq (1/z)\ngq (z)\n\n. Second case, if z \u2208 \u03a0m \\ $, then gq (z) \u2208 C\u2212 and\n\ngq (1/z) \u2208 C+ . Thus, gq (z) and gq (1/z) cannot be positive multiples of each other,\ng (1/z)\ni.e. qgq (z) 6\u2208 [0, +\u221e). Generally, for the relation |a| \u2212 1 = |a \u2212 1| to hold it is\ng (1/z)\n\nnecessary that a \u2265 1. Applying this observation to a = qgq (z) , we conclude that\nthe inequality must be strict also for z \u2208 \u03a0m \\ $.\nThus, we conclude that gq (z) and gq (z) \u2212 gq (1/z) have the same number\nof zeros in the domain delimited by \u03a0m . This completes the proof of (4) and of our\nlemma.\n\u0003\n\n\f10\n\nM. ANSHELEVICH, S. T. BELINSCHI, M. BO\u017bEJKO, AND F.

By part (4) of the same lemma, the map\nD 3 w 7\u2192 k\u0398(w) = gq (w)\u2212gq (1/w) must then have a zero in D. But D\u2229R = \u2205, and\nwe have seen in Equation (4) that the zeros of \u0398 are real. This is a contradiction.\nWe conclude that gq has no critical points in Xq , and so \u03a6 has an analytic\ncontinuation to the whole lower half-plane.
