However, the quantities we\nneed are closely related to observables, in particular in the limit of \u03bd\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd\u03c4 symmetry (\u03b8atm = 450\nand Ue3 = 0), in which all mass eigenstates contain equal fractions of \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 . In that limit,\nthe fluxes for \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 are always in the ratio 1\n: 1, with or without decay. This is useful since\nthe \u03bd\u03c4 flux is the hardest to measure.\nEven in the extreme case when one assumes\nthat tau events are not identifiable, something\nabout the flavor mix can be deduced. Let the\nonly experimental information available be the\nnumber of muon tracks and the number of showers.The relative number of shower events to track\nevents can be related to the most interesting\nquantity for testing decay scenarios, i.e., the \u03bde\nto \u03bd\u03bc ratio. The precision of the upcoming experiments should be good enough to test the extreme flavor ratios produced by decays. If electromagnetic and hadronic showers can be separated,\nthen the precision will be even better[45].\n\nThe flux ratios we discuss are energyindependent because we have assumed that the\nratios at production are energy-independent, that\nall oscillations are averaged out, and that all possible decays are complete. In the standard scenario with only oscillations, the final flux ratios\nare \u03c6\u03bde : \u03c6\u03bd\u03bc : \u03c6\u03bd\u03c4 = 1 : 1 : 1. In the cases with\ndecay, we have found rather different possible flux\nratios, for example 5 : 1 : 1 in the normal hierarchy and 0 : 1 : 1 in the inverted hierarchy. These\ndeviations from 1 : 1 : 1 are so extreme that they\nshould be readily measurable.\nIf we are very fortunate[47], we may be able\nto observe a reasonable number of events from\nseveral sources (of known distance) and/or over\na sufficient range in energy. Then the resulting\ndependence of the flux ratio (\u03bde /\u03bd\u03bc ) on L/E as\nit evolves from say 5 (or 0) to 1, can be clear\nevidence of decay and further can pin down the\nactual lifetime instead of just placing a bound.\nTo summarize, we suggest that if future measurements of the flavor mix at earth of high en-\n\n\f10\nergy astrophysical neutrinos find it to be\n\u03c6\u03bde /\u03c6\u03bd\u03bc /\u03c6\u03bd\u03c4 = \u03b1/1/1;\n\n11. Acknowledgements\n(20)\n\nthen\n(i) \u03b1 \u2248 1 (the most boring case) confirms our\nknowledge of the MNSP[2] matrix and our\nprejudice about the production mechanism;\n\nThis talk is based on published and ongoing\nwork in collaboration with John Beacom, Nicole\nBell, Dan Hooper, John Learned and Tom Weiler.\nI thank them for a most enjoyable collaboration; I\nalso thank them for a careful and critical reading\nof the manuscript. I would like to acknowledge\nthe splendid hospitality of the Fujihara founda-\n\n(ii) \u03b1 \u2248 1/2 indicates that the source emits pure\n\u03bd\u03bc\u2032 s and the mixing is conventional;\n\n(iii) \u03b1 \u2248 3 from a unique direction, e.g. the\nCygnus region, would be evidence in favour\nof a pure \u03bd\u0304e production as has been suggested recently[48];\n(iv) \u03b1 > 1 indicates that neutrinos are decaying\nwith normal hierarchy; and\n(v) \u03b1 \u226a 1 would mean that neutrino decays are\noccuring with inverted hierarchy;\n(vi) Values of \u03b1 which cover a broader range (3\nto 15) and deviation of the \u03bc/\u03c4 ratio from\n1(between 0.2 to 5) can yield valuable information about Ue3 and cos \u03b4. Deviations\nof \u03b1 which are less extreme(between 0.7 and\n1.5) can also probe very small pseudo-Dirac\n\u03b4m2 (smaller than 10\u221212 eV 2 ).\n\ntion and Yoji Totsuka and Kenzo Nakamura in\nTsukuba.
