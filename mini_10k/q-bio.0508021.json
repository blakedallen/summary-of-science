In particular, the protein-protein interaction network, combining\nmany different interactions of proteins within a cell, has\nbeen the subject of many studies (for a recent review see\n[1]). While this network shares many of the universal\nfeatures of natural networks such as the scale-free distribution of degrees [2], and the small world characteristics\n[3], it also has some unique features. One of the most\nimportant of these is arguably the fact that the protein\ninteractions underlying this network can be separated\ninto two roughly disjoint classes. One of them relates\nto transmission of information within the cell: protein\nA interacts with protein B and changes it, by a conformational or chemical transformation. The usual scenario\nafter such an interaction is that the two proteins disassociate shortly after the completion of the transformation.\nOn the other hand, many protein interactions are aimed\nat the formation of a protein complex. In this mode of\noperation the physical attachment of two or more proteins is needed in order to allow for the biological activity of the combined complex, and is typically stable over\nrelatively long time scales [4].\nThe yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae serves as the\nmodel organism for most of the analyses of proteinprotein interaction network. The complete set of genes\nand proteins with extensive data on gene expression are\navailable [5] for this unicellular organism, accompanied\nby large datasets of protein-protein interactions based on\na wide range of experimental and computational methods\n[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. In addition, the intracellular locations and the expression levels of most proteins\nof the yeast were recently reported [15]. The availability\nof such data enables us to study the relationship between\nnetwork topology and the expression levels of each protein.\nIn this work we demonstrate the importance of the distinction between different types of protein interaction,\n\nby highlighting one property which is unique to interactions of the protein complexes. Combining databases\nof yeast protein interactions with the recently reported\ninformation on the protein concentration, we find that\nproteins belonging to the same complex tend to have a\nmore uniform concentration distribution. We further explain this finding by a model of complex formation, showing that uneven concentrations of the complex members\nresult in inefficient complex formation. Surprisingly, in\nsome cases increasing the concentration of one of the\ncomplex ingredients decreases the absolute number of\ncomplexes formed. Thus, the experimental observation\nof uniform complex members concentrations can be explained in terms of selection for efficiency.\n\nII.\n\nCONCENTRATIONS OF INTERACTING\nPROTEINS\n\nWe start by studying the concentrations of pairs of interacting proteins, and demonstrate that different types\nof protein-protein interactions differ in their properties.\nFor this purpose we use the recently published database\nproviding the (average) concentration [15], as well as\nthe localization within the cell, for most of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) proteins [16]. The\nconcentrations ci (given in arbitrary units) are approximately distributed according to a log-normal distribution\nwith hlog(ci )i = 7.89 and standard deviation 1.53 (Fig.\n1).\nThe bakers' yeast serves as a model organism for most\nof the protein-protein interaction network studies. Thus\na set of many of its protein-protein interactions is also\nreadily available. Here we use a dataset of recorded\nyeast protein interactions, given with various levels of\nconfidence [14]. The dataset lists about 80000 interactions between approximately 5300 of the yeast proteins\n(or about 12000 interactions between 2600 proteins when\nexcluding interactions of the lowest confidence). These\ninteractions were deduced by many different experimental methods, and describe different biological relations\n\n\f2\n0.2\n\nProbability\n\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n0\n\n5\n10\nlog(concentration)\n\n15\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Distribution of the logarithm of the\nprotein concentration (in units of protein molecules per cell)\nfor all measured proteins within the yeast cell.\n\nbetween the proteins involved. The protein interaction\nnetwork exhibits a high level of clustering (clustering co-\n\nefficient \u2248 0.39). This is partly due to the existence of\nmany sets of proteins forming complexes, where each of\nthe complex members interacts with many other members.\nCombining these two databases, we study the correlation between the (logarithm of) concentrations of pairs\nof interacting proteins. In order to gain insight into the\ndifferent components of the network, we perform this calculation separately for the interactions deduced by different experimental methods. For simplicity, we report\nhere the results after excluding the interactions annotated as low-confidence (many of which are expected to\nbe false-positives). We have explicitly checked that their\ninclusion does not change the results qualitatively.

The mean correlation of the randomly permuted networks was zero, and the\nstandard deviation (STD) is given. The P-value was calculated assuming gaussian distribution of the correlation values for the randomized networks. We have verified that the\ndistributions of the 1,000 realizations calculated are roughly\nGuassian.\n\nThe strongest correlation is seen for the subset of protein interactions which were derived from synexpression,\ni.e. inferred from correlated mRNA expression. This result confirms the common expectation that genes with\ncorrelated mRNA expression would yield correlated protein levels as well[7]. However, our results show that\ninteracting protein pairs whose interaction was deduced\n\nby other methods exhibit significant positive correlation\nas well. The effect is weak for the yeast 2-Hybrid (Y2H)\nmethod[10] which includes all possible physical interactions between the proteins (and is also known to suffer\nfrom many artifacts and false-positives), but stronger for\nthe HMS (High-throughput Mass Spectrometry)[9] and\nTAP (Tandem-Affinity Purification)[13] interactions cor-\n\n\f3\nresponding to actual physical interactions (i.e., experimental evidence that the proteins actually bind together\nin-vivo). These experimental methods are specifically designed to detect cellular protein complexes. The above\nresults thus hint that the overall correlation between concentrations of interacting proteins is due to the tendency\nof proteins which are part of a stable complex to have\nsimilar concentrations.\nThe same picture emerges when one counts the number of interactions a protein has with other proteins of\nsimilar concentration, compared to the number of interactions with randomly chosen proteins. A protein interacts, on average, with 0.49% of the proteins with similar\nexpression level (i.e., |log-difference| < 1), as opposed\nto only 0.36 \u00b1 0.01 % of random proteins, in agreement\nwith the above observation of complex members having\nsimilar protein concentrations.\nIn order to directly test this hypothesis (i.e. that proteins in a complex have similar concentrations), we use\nexisting datasets of protein complexes and study the uniformity of concentrations of members of each complex.\nThe complexes data were taken from [17], and were found\nto have many TAP interactions within them. As a measure of the uniformity of the expression levels within each\ncomplex, we calculate the variance of the (logarithm of\nthe) concentrations among the members of each complex.\nThe average variance (over all complexes) is found to be\n2.35, compared to 2.88 \u00b1 0.07 and 2.74 \u00b1 0.11 for randomized complexes in two different randomization schemes\n(see figure), confirming that the concentrations of complex members tend to be more uniform than a random\nset of proteins.\n\n(a)\n\n3\nVariance\n\n(b)\n\nRandom (2)\n\nRandom (1)\n\nteraction network, the one from the DIP database [18].\nWe look for fully-connected sub-graphs of size 5, which\nare expected to represent complexes, sub-complexes or\ngroups of proteins working together. The network contains approximately 1600 (highly overlapping) such pentagons, made of about 300 different proteins. The variance of the logarithm of the concentrations of each pentagon members, averaged over the different pentagons, is\n1.234. As before, this is a significantly low variance compared with random sets of five proteins (average variance\n1.847 \u00b1 0.02 and 1.718 \u00b1 0.21), see figure 2.\nFinally, we have used mRNA expression data [7] and\nlooked for correlated expression patterns within complexes. We have calculated the correlation coefficient between the expression data of the two proteins for each\npair of proteins which are part of the same pentagon.\nThe average correlation coefficient between proteins belonging to the same fully-connected pentagon is 0.15 compared to 0.056 \u00b1 0.005 for a random pair.\nIn summary, combination of a number of yeast protein interaction networks with protein and mRNA expression data yields the conclusion that interacting proteins tend to have similar concentrations. The effect is\nstronger when focusing on interactions which represent\nstable physical interactions, i.e. complex formation, suggesting that the overall effect is largely due to the uniformity in the concentrations of proteins belonging to\nthe same complex. In the next Section we explain this\nfinding by a model of complex formation. We show, on\ngeneral grounds, that complex formation is more effective\nwhen the concentrations of its constituents is roughly the\nsame. Thus, the observation made in the present Section\ncan be explained by selection for efficiency of complex\nformation.\n\nRandom (2)\n\n2\nRandom (1)\n\nIII.\n2.5\n\nReal\n\n1.5\nReal\n\n2\n\nComplexes\n\n1\n\nPentagons\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) (a) Variance of the logarithm of the\nprotein expression levels (in units of mulecules per cell) for\nmembers of real complexes, averaged over all complexes,\ncomapred with the averaged variance of the complexes after randomization of their members, letting each protein participate on average in the same number of complexes (random(1)), as well as randomized complexes where the number\nof complexes each protein participates in is kept fixed (random(2)). Real complexes have a lower variance, indicating\nhigher uniformity in the expression levels of the underlying\nproteins. (b) Same as (a) for expression levels in pentagons\n(see text).\n\nAs another test, we study a different yeast protein in-\n\nMODEL\n\nHere we study a model of complex formation, and explore the effectiveness of complex production as a function of the relative abundances of its constituents. For\nsimplicity, we start by a detailed analysis of the threecomponents complex production, which already captures\nmost of the important effects.\nDenote the concentrations of the three components of\nthe complex by A, B and C, and the concentrations of the\ncomplexes they form by AB, AC, BC and ABC. The latter is the concentration of the full complex, which is the\ndesired outcome of the production, while the first three\ndescribe the different sub-complexes which are formed\n(in this case, each of which is composed of two components). Three-body processes, i.e., direct generation (or\ndecomposition) of ABC out of A B and C, can usually\nbe neglected [19], but their inclusion here does not complicate the analysis. The resulting set of reaction kinetic\nequations is given by\n\n\f4\n\nd(A)\n= kdA,B AB + kdA,C AC + (kdA,BC + kdA,B,C ) * ABC\ndt\n\u2212kaA,B A * B \u2212 kaA,C A * C \u2212 kaA,BC A * BC \u2212 kaA,B,C A * B * C\nd(B)\n= kdA,B AB + kdB,C BC + (kdB,AC + kdA,B,C ) * ABC\ndt\n\u2212kaA,B A * B \u2212 kaB,C B * C \u2212 kaB,AC B * AC \u2212 kaA,B,C A * B * C\nd(C)\n= kdA,C AC + kdB,C BC + (kdC,AB + kdA,B,C ) * ABC\ndt\n\u2212kaA,C A * C \u2212 kaB,C B * C \u2212 kaC,AB C * AB \u2212 kaA,B,C A * B * C\nd(AB)\n= kaA,B A * B + kdC,AB ABC \u2212 kdA,B AB \u2212 kaC,AB C * AB\ndt\nd(AC)\n= kaA,C A * C + kdB,AC ABC \u2212 kdA,C AC \u2212 kaB,AC B * AC\ndt\nd(BC)\n= kaB,C B * C + kdA,BC ABC \u2212 kdB,C BC \u2212 kaA,BC A * BC\ndt\nd(ABC)\n= kaA,BC A * BC + kaB,AC B * AC + kaC,AB C * AB + kaA,B,C A * B * C\ndt\n\u2212(kdA,BC + kdB,AC + kdC,AB + kdA,B,C ) * ABC\n\nwhere kax,y (kdx,y ) are the association (dissociation) rates\nof the subcomponents x and y to form the complex xy.\nDenoting the total number of type A, B and C particles\nby A0 , B0 , C0 , respectively, we may write the conservation of material equations:\nA + AB + AC + ABC = A0\nB + BC + AB + ABC = B0\nA + AC + BC + ABC = C0\n\n(8)\n(9)\n(10)\n\nWe look for the steady-state solution of these equations, where all time derivatives vanish. For simplicity,\nwe consider first the totally symmetric situation, where\nall the ratios of association coefficients to their corresponding dissociation coefficients are equal, i.e., the ratios kdx,y /kax,y are all equal to X0 and kdx,y,z /kax,y,z =\nX02 , where X0 is a constant with concentrations units.\nIn this case, measuring all concentrations in units of X0 ,\nall the reaction equations are solved by the substitutions\nAB = A*B, AC = A*C, BC = B*C and ABC = A*B*C,\nand one needs only to solve the material conservation\nequations, which take the form:\nA + A * B + A * C + A * B * C = A0\nB + B * C + A * B + A * B * C = B0\nA + A * C + B * C + A * B * C = C0\n\n(11)\n(12)\n(13)\n\nThese equations allow for an exact and straight-forward\n(albeit cumbersome) analytical solution. In the following, we explore the properties of this solution. The\nefficiency of the production of ABC, the desired complex, can be measured by the number of formed complexes relative to the maximal number of complexes possible given the initial concentrations of supplied particles\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\neff \u2261 ABC/ min (A0 , B0 , C0 ). This definition does not\ntake into account the obvious waste resulting from proteins of the more abundant species which are bound to be\nleftover due to shortage of proteins of the other species.\nIn the following we show that having unmatched concentrations of the different complex components result in\nlower efficiency beyond this obvious waste.\nIn the linear regime, A0 , B0 , C0 \u226a 1, the fraction of\nparticles forming complexes is small, and all concentrations are just proportional to the initial concentrations.\nThe overall efficiency of the process in this regime is extremely low, ABC = A*B *C \u223c A0 *B0 *C0 \u226a A0 , B0 , C0 .\nWe thus go beyond this trivial linear regime, and focus\non the region where all concentrations are greater than\nunity. Fig. 3 presents the efficiency as a function of\nA0 and B0 , for fixed C0 = 102 . The efficiency is maximized when the two more abundant components have\napproximately the same concentration, i.e., for A0 \u2248 B0\n(if C0 < A0 , B0 ), for A0 \u2248 C0 = 102 (if B0 < A0 , C0 )\nand for B0 \u2248 C0 = 102 (if A0 < B0 , C0 ).\nMoreover, looking at the absolute quantity of the complex product, one observes (fixing the concentrations of\ntwo of substances, e.g., B0 and C0 ) that ABC itself has\na maximum at some finite A0 , i.e., there is a finite optimal concentration for A particles (see Fig. 4). Adding\nmore molecules of type A beyond the optimal concentration decreases the amount of the desired complexes. The\nconcentration that maximizes the overall production of\nthe three-component complex is A0,max \u2248 max (B0 , C0 ).\nAn analytical solution is available for a somewhat\nmore general situation, allowing the ratios kdx,y /kax,y\nto take different values for the two-components association/dissociation (X0 ) and the three-components\n\n\f5\ncomplex is much more stable than the intermediate AB,\nAC, and BC states.\n\n4\n\nA0\n\n10\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n2\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10 0\n2\n4\n10 10 10\nB0\n\n4\n\n\u03b1 = 0.1\n\n4\n\n10\n\n\u03b1 = 10\n\n10\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) The efficiency of the synthesis eff \u2261\nABC/ min (A0 , B0 , C0 ) as a function of A0 and B0 , for C0 =\n102 .

In particular,\nthe synthesis is most efficient when the two highest concentrations are roughly equal, see Fig. 5. Note that our\nresults hold even for \u03b1 \u226b 1, where the three-component\n\nWe have explicitly checked that the same picture holds\nfor 4-component complexes as well: fixing the concentrations B0 , C0 , and D0 , the concentration of the target complex ABCD is again maximized for A0,max \u2248\nmax (B0 , C0 , D0 ). This behavior is expected to hold qualitatively for a general number of components and arbitrary reaction rates, due to the following argument:\nAssume a complex is to be produced from many constituents, one of which (A) is far more abundant than\nthe others (B, C, ...). Since A is in excess, almost all B\nparticles will bound to A and form AB complexes. Similarly, almost all C particles will bound to A to form an\nAC complex. Thus, there will be very few free C particles to bound to the AB complexes, and very few free\nB particles available for binding with the AC complexes.\nAs a result, one gets relatively many half-done AB and\nAC complexes, but not the desired ABC (note that AB\nand AC cannot bound together). Lowering the concentration of A particles allows more B and C particles to\nremain in an unbounded state, and thus increases the\ntotal production rate of ABC complexes (Fig. 6).\nMany proteins take part in more than one complex.\nOne might thus wonder what is the optimal concentration for these, and how it affects the general correlation\nobserved between the concentrations of members of the\nsame complex. In order to clarify this issue, we have studied a model in which four proteins A, B, C and D bind together to form two desired products: the ABC and BCD\ncomplexes. A and D do not interact, so that there are\nno complexes or sub-complexes of the type AD, ABD,\nACD and ABCD. Solution of this model (see appendix)\nreveals that the efficiency of the production of ABC and\nBCD is maximized when (for a fixed ratio of A0 and D0 )\n\n\fComplex Concentrations\n\n6\n1000\n800\n600\n\nABC\nAB\n10*C\n\n400\n200\n0 0\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\nA\n\n10\n\n4\n\n6\n\n10\n\n0\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) The dimensionless concentrations of\nthe complex ABC (solid line), partial complex AB (dashed\nline), and C (dotted line) as a function of the total concentration of A particles, A0 (C is multiplied by 10 for visibility).\nB0 and C0 are fixed B0 = C0 = 103 . The maximum of ABC\nfor finite A0 is a result of the balance between increase in the\nnumber of AB and AC complexes and the decrease in the\nnumber of available free B and C particles as A0 increases.\n\nA0 + D0 \u2248 B0 \u2248 C0 . One thus sees, as could have been\nexpected, that proteins that are involved in more than\none complex (like B and C in the above model) will tend\nto have higher concentrations than other members of the\nsame complex participating in only one complex. Nevertheless, since the protein-protein interaction network\nis scale-free, most proteins take part in a small-number\nof complexes, and only a very small fraction participate\nin many complexes. Moreover, given the three orders of\nmagnitude spread in protein concentrations (see figure\n1), only proteins participating in a very large number of\ncomplexes (relative to the avregae participation) or participating in two complexes of a very different concentrations (i.e., A0 \u226b D0 ) will result in order-of-magnitude\ndeviations from the equal concentration optimum. The\neffects of these relatively few proteins on the average over\nall interacting proteins is small enough not to destroy the\nconcentration correlation, as we observed in the experimental data.\nIn summary, the solution of our simplified complex formation model shows that the rate and efficiency of complex formation depends strongly, and in a non-obvious\nway, on the relative concentrations of the constituents\nof the complex. The efficiency is maximized when all\nconcentrations of the different complex constituents are\nroughly equal. Adding more of the ingredients beyond\nthis optimal point not only reduces the efficiency, but\nalso results in lower product yield. This unexpected behavior is qualitatively explained by a simple argument,\nand is expected to hold generally. Therefore, effective\nformation of complexes in a network puts constraints on\nthe concentrations on the underlying building blocks. Accordingly, one can understand the tendency of members\nof cellular protein-complexes to have uniform concentrations, as presented in the previous Section, as a selection\ntowards efficiency.\nAPPENDIX: TWO COUPLED COMPLEXES\n\nWe consider a model in which four proteins A, B, C\nand D bind together to form two desired products: the\n\nABC and BCD complexes. A and D do not interact,\nso that there are no complexes or sub-complexes of the\ntype AD, ABD, ACD and ABCD. For simplicity, we\nassume the totally symmetric situation, where all the ratios of association coefficients to their corresponding dissociation coefficients are equal, i.e., the ratios kdx,y /kax,y\nare all equal to X0 and kdx,y,z /kax,y,z = X02 , where X0 is\na constant with concentrations units. The extension to\nthe more general case discussed in the paper is straight\nforward. Using the same scaling as above, the reaction\nequations are solved by the substitutions AB = A * B,\nAC = A * C, BC = B * C, BD = B * D, CD = C * D,\nABC = A * B * C, and BCD = B * C * D, and one needs\nonly to solve the material conservation equations, which\ntake the form:\nA +A * B + A * C + A * B * C = A0\n(A.1)\nB +A * B + B * C + B * D + A * B * C + B * C * D = B0\n(A.2)\nC +A * C + B * C + C * D + A * B * C + B * C * D = C0\n(A.3)\nD +B * D + C * D + B * C * D = D0\n(A.4)\nDenoting \u03b3 \u2261\n\nD0\n\u2032\nA0 , D\n\n\u2261\n\nD\n\u03b3,\n\nEq (A.4) becomes\n\nD\u2032 + D\u2032 * B + D\u2032 * C + D\u2032 * B * C = A0\n\n(A.5)\n\nThis is exactly the equation we wrote for A (A.1), and\nthus D = \u03b3A. Substitutng this into equations (A.2) and\n(A.3), one gets\nB + B * C + (\u03b3 + 1)A * B + (\u03b3 + 1)A * B * C = B0(A.6)\nC + B * C + (\u03b3 + 1)A * C + (\u03b3 + 1)A * B * C = C0(A.7)\nWe now define A\u2032 \u2261 (\u03b3 + 1)A, A\u20320 \u2261 (\u03b3 + 1)A0 and obtain\nfrom (A.1,A.6,A.7)\nA\u2032 + A\u2032 * B + A\u2032 * C + A\u2032 * B * C = A\u20320\nB + A\u2032 * B + B * C + A\u2032 * B * C = B0\nC + A\u2032 * C + B * C + A\u2032 * B * C = C0\n\n(A.8)\n(A.9)\n(A.10)\n\nThese are the very same equations that we wrote for\nthe 3-particles case where the desired product was ABC.\nTheir solution showed that efficiency is maximized at\nA0 \u2248 B0 \u2248 C0 . We thus conclude that in the present\n4-component scenario, the efficiency of ABC and BCD\n(for fixed \u03b3) is maximized when (A0 + D0 ) \u2248 B0 \u2248 C0 .\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Ehud Schreiber for critical reading of the\nmanuscript and many helpful comments.
