A way to study the resources needed for\nuniversal quantum computation (UQC) is to analyze the transition from a system that can provide UQC to one that is classically efficiently simulable. A particularly useful example of\nsuch a system is given by the stabilizer operations, which are\nmade by a combination of: preparation of |0i states, unitary\nClifford gates, measurements in the {|0i, |1i} basis and classical control determined by the measurement outcomes. The\nGottesman-Knill theorem tells us that the such stabilizer operations can be efficiently simulated classically (see for example [1, Theorem 10.7]), while it also known that the addition\nof any other one-qubit gate outside the Clifford group will enable the system to perform UQC. This fact provides us with\na framework for testing tolerance to noise-one can examine\nhow noisy this additional non-Clifford gate can be before it\nbecomes classically simulable itself. If the non-Clifford operation has become a probabilistic combination of Clifford gates\ndue to the noise, then we know that we are unequivocally in\nthe classical computational regime. The noise rate where the\nextra gate becomes simulable (where it enters the \"Clifford\npolytope\" [11]) is an thus upper bound for fault tolerance. If\nthe converse is true-i.e. if any operation outside the Clifford\npolytope enables UQC then the threshold is tight. In this article we show that for single-qubit gates undergoing depolarizing such a tight noise threshold does indeed apply. We will do\nso by proving that any depolarized gate that lies outside the\nClifford polytope of single-qubit operations, in combination\nwith noiseless stabilizing operations, allows for UQC. This\nresult should be contrasted to the situation for non-stabilizer\nqubit states where the thresholds in that case are not currently\nknown to be tight.\nWe will consistently assume that Clifford gates can be implemented perfectly, motivated by the fact that these gates can\nbe implemented fault-tolerantly by applying them transver-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: vandam@cs.ucsb.edu;\naddress: mhoward@physics.ucsb.edu\n\nsally and to encoded states [2, 3, 4, 5]. The fault-tolerant\nimplementation of Clifford gates naturally carries with it a\nthreshold of its own, independent of the kind we discuss in\nthis paper. The current model is particulary relevant to the\nso-called Pfaffian quantum Hall state in topological quantum\ncomputation [12, 13], where the whole Clifford group (but\nonly the Clifford group) can be implemented using braiding\nmaking these operations naturally fault-tolerant. The additional resource required to perform UQC will likely be highly\nnoisy, and so we can see the parallels with our model.\nWe will begin by listing a couple of previously known results in this area. Next, we will discuss the connection between the geometry of the Clifford polytope and stabilizer\nmeasurements, and show that tightness of a magic-state distillation procedure for single-qubit states automatically ensures\ntight thresholds for non-Clifford gates undergoing any kind\nof unital noise. Finally we show that currently known magicstate distillation techniques are sufficient to prove tight thresholds for a non-Clifford gate undergoing depolarizing noise.\nPreviously known results. The idea of using perfect stabilizer operations in conjunction with imperfect non-stabilizer\nstates to perform UQC originates with Bravyi and Kitaev [6].\nThe conditions on the ancillary qubits to enable UQC is that\nthey are sufficiently close to being one of the 20 so-called\nmagic states that lie on the surface of the Bloch sphere. The\ntwo classes of magic state (see Figure 1) are the |Hi type and\n|T i type, where all |Hi type states can be derived by applying a Clifford operation to some canonical representative (and\nsimilarly for |T i states);\n\u0011\n\u0131\u03c0\n1 \u0010\n|Hi = \u221a |0i + e 4 |1i\n2\n\u0131\u03c0\n\n|T i = cos(\u03b8)|0i + e 4 sin(\u03b8)|1i,\n\n(1)\n1\ncos(2\u03b8) = \u221a\n3\n\n(2)\n\nThe routines used in [6] were unable to distill qubit states just\noutside the edges and faces of the octahedron of Figure 1. Reichardt [7] subsequently suggested an improved routine that\nclosed the gap in the |Hi direction (along the edges of the\n\n\f2\nci j = Tr (\u03c1(\u03c3i \u2297 \u03c3 j )) so that\n1\nci j (\u03c3i \u2297 \u03c3 j )\ni, j \u2208 {I, X,Y, Z}.\n(5)\n4\u2211\nSince we have applied a local unitary to a maximally entangled state, the coefficients (cIX , cIY , cIZ , cXI , cY I , cZI ) are always zero. Comparing the 9 coefficients {cXX , cXY , . . . , cZZ }\none can see that these are the same as the entries of the SO(3)\nmatrix R(\u03b8, \u03b3, \u03b4).

The octahedron defined by |x| + |y| +\n|z| \u2264 1 depicts the single qubit states that can be created by stabilizer\noperations. Reichardt [7] showed that distillation techniques work\nright up to the edges of the octahedron (i.e. tight in the |Hi direction).\nCurrent distillation techniques are unable to distill states just outside\nthe faces of the octahedron (i.e. not tight in the |T i direction).\n\nwhere the ci j are obviously also functions of (\u03b8, \u03b3, \u03b4).\nIf we represent the 24 single-qubit Clifford operations as\nSO(3) matrices, then they are simply signed permutation matrices with unit determinant (they are a matrix representation\nof the elements of the chiral octahedral symmetry group or,\nequivalently, the symmetry group S4 ). We label these operations Ci and so the convex hull of the Ci (the so-called Clifford\npolytope) is given by\n(\n)\n24\n\nP=\n\n24\n\n\u2211 piCi\n\nwith pi \u2265 0 and\n\ni=1\n\noctahedron). Virmani et al. [9] suggested using the convex\nhull of Clifford operations in order to find gates' robustness\nto various types of noise. In particular they considered gates\nthat are diagonal in the computational basis. Plenio and Virmani [10] subsequently extended this idea by analyzing cases\nwhere noise was allowed to affect the stabilizer operations too.\nBuhrman et al. [11] used a similar idea (that noise causes nonClifford gates to eventually become implementable via Clifford gates only) to find the non-Clifford gate that is most resistant to depolarizing noise-a \u03c0/8 rotation about the Z axis\n(or the same gate modulo some Clifford operation). Reichardt\n[8] showed that this particular gate enabled UQC right up to\nits threshold noise rate (about 45%), as well as considering\nin detail the process of reducing multi-qubit states to singlequbit states using postselected stabilizer operations. Our current result here generalizes this tightness result to all possible\nsingle-qubit gates.\nPreliminaries and Notation. Let us parameterize an arbitrary single-qubit SU(2) gate as follows\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0131\u03b3\ne cos(\u03b8) \u2212e\u0131\u03b4 sin(\u03b8)\n(3)\nU(\u03b8, \u03b3, \u03b4) =\ne\u2212\u0131\u03b4 sin(\u03b8) e\u2212\u0131\u03b3 cos(\u03b8)\nThe representation of this rotation in SO(3) is denoted by\nR(\u03b8, \u03b3, \u03b4). Implementing a rotation R while suffering depolarizing noise (with noise rate p), means that this noisy operation\nis represented by the rescaling M = (1 \u2212 p)R, a fact that we\nwill need later.\nOften we will apply the unitary U(\u03b8, \u03b3, \u03b4) to one half of an\nentangled Bell pair, |\u03a6i = \u221a12 (|00i + |11i), yielding\n\u03c1 = (I \u2297 U)|\u03a6ih\u03a6|(I \u2297 U)\n\n\u2020\n\n(4)\n\nIf we use the two-qubit Pauli operators as a basis for the\ndensity matrix \u03c1 then we can find the 16 real coefficients\n\n\u2211 pi = 1\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\ni=1\n\nGeometrically, the Clifford polytope is a closed polyhedron\nin R9 that has 24 vertices (each vertex representing one of\nthe Ci ). This polytope can also be defined by the bounding\ninequalities of its 120 facets. The concise description of these\nfacets used by Buhrman et al. [11] is given by the set\n\nF = {Ci FC j |i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , 24}, F \u2208 {A, AT , B}}\n\n(8)\n\nwhere\nA=\n\n1 0 0\n1 0 0\n1 0 0\n\n!\n\nand B =\n\n0 1 0\n1 0 \u22121\n1 0 1\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\nAt times we will have reason to refer to different subsets of\nthe set of facets F so we use the obvious notation\n\nF = FA \u222a FAT \u222a FB .\n\n(10)\n\nIt is useful to note that all the facets derived from A comprise a\nsingle column with \u00b11 entries and zeros elsewhere, and similarly for the row facets derived from AT , hence |FA | = |FAT | =\n3 * 23 = 24. There are |FB | = 72 \"B-type\" facets, which can\nbe constructed as follows: (i) Pick one position in the matrix\ne.g. Mi, j and put \u00b11 there (9 \u00d7 2 = 18 choices), (ii) Fill the\nremaining entries not in row i or column j with \u00b11 such that\ndet(M) = \u22122 (4 choices).\nTo determine whether or not an operation M is inside the\nClifford polytope P we take the elementwise inner product\n(or Frobenius inner product) between M and the facets F \u2208 F\nof the polytope\n3\n\nM*F =\n\n\u2211\n\nMi, j Fi, j = Tr(M T F).\n\n(11)\n\ni, j=1\n\nUsing the above notation, a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix M is inside the polytope P if and only if for all F \u2208 F we have M * F \u2264 1.\n\n\f3\nInterpreting the facets of the Clifford polytope. Our proof\nwill involve applying some non-Clifford gate to one half of\na Bell Pair (as in Eq. 4) and then postselecting on the outcomes of various stabilizer measurements. This has the effect\nof taking our two-qubit state \u03c1 to a single qubit state \u03c1\u2032 (times\nsome stabilizer state that we do not care about), which we\nthen distill using magic state distillation (see [8] for a more\ngeneral discussion of these kinds of techniques). For example, performing a Y X measurement on \u03c1 and postselecting on\na \"+1\" outcome (i.e. projecting with \u03a0 = 21 (II + Y X)) leads\nto a single-qubit state \u03c1\u2032 with a Bloch vector given by\n\u0010 c \u2212c\ncXY +cZZ \u0011\nXZ\nZY\n~r(\u03c1\u2032 ) = 0,\n.\n(12)\n,\u2212\ncII +cY X\ncII +cY X\n\nThe form of this vector means that it lies in the Y Z plane (see\nFigure 1), where we know that distillation techniques work\nright up to the edge |y| + |z| = 1 of the octahedron. We can\ncheck if ~r is outside the octahedron by simply comparing the\nL1 norm of ~r with 1. Rearranged, the condition ||~r||1 > 1 for\nbeing outside the octahedron is\n|cXZ \u2212 cZY | + | \u2212 (cXY + cZZ ) | \u2265 |cII + cY X |.\n\n(13)\n\nGiven the correspondence between the coefficients ci j and the\nelements of R (see Eq. 6) we can rewrite the above condition\n(dropping the absolute value operators) as a facet inequality\n!\n0 1 0\nR * F > 1 where F = \u22121 0 \u22121 .\n(14)\n1 0 \u22121\nThis facet is a legitimate \"B-type\" facet and a little thought\nshows that, had we applied the single qubit Pauli operations\n(as SO(3) rotations) X,Y or Z to~r(\u03c1\u2032 ) above, we would arrive\nat three other \"B-type\" facets\n!\n!\n!\n0 1 0\n0 1 0\n0 1 0\n1 0 1 , 1 0 \u22121 , or \u22121 0 1 . (15)\n\u22121 0 1\n1 0 1\n\u22121 0 \u22121\nrespectively. Note that all four facet inequalities combined\ncould be simplified to the form Eq. 13 above. We omit the\ndetails, but it should be easy to see that all 72 \"B-type\" facets\ncorrespond to postselecting on some (weight two) Pauli operator, and possibly performing a single qubit Pauli rotation on\nthe resulting \u03c1\u2032 .\nIt is somewhat more straightforward to see the geometrical interpretation of the \"A(T ) -type\" facets. For example, the\ncanonical A given in Eq. 9, merely returns the sum of the elements of the Bloch vector~r, arising from a rotation applied to\nthe X \"+1\" eigenstate.\n!\n1\n3\n(16)\nR * A = \u2211 ri where ~r = R 0 .\ni=1\n0\nIn general, an operation M having an inner product greater\nthan one with some \"A-type\" facet simply means that M, applied to some initial vector corresponding to a stabilizer state,\nbrings that vector to a final position outside the octahedron.\n\nThe preceding discussion shows us that if magic state distillation was possible everywhere outside the octahedron, then\nevery unital operation outside the Clifford polytope would be\ndistillable - either straightforwardly or by using postselection, depending on which facet it violated. Using current (not\ntight) distillation routines however, we would be unable to\ndeal with some operations violating an \"A-type\" facet by a\nfairly small amount. In the next section we show that, for\ndepolarizing noise, any noisy rotation violating an \"A-type\"\nfacet also violates a \"B-type\" facet. Since \"B-type\" facets correspond to |Hi state distillation, the results we obtain are tight.\nTight threshold for depolarizing noise. The claim we shall\nprove is that, anytime a matrix M = (1 \u2212 p)R, representing a\ndepolarized rotation, is outside some \"A-type\" facet then there\nexists a \"B-type\" facet that M also lies outside. In fact, we will\nprove the slightly stronger statement that for all R \u2208 SO(3)\n\u2200A \u2208 FA \u222a FAT , \u2203B \u2208 FB such that R * (B \u2212 A) \u2265 0.\n\n(17)\n\nTo simplify the proof we will repeatedly make use of the\nsymmetries of the problem (see Eq. 9). We will pick a canonical \"A-type\" facet and assume that this gives the largest inner\nproduct with R of all the F \u2208 FA . If there was a larger inner\nproduct with some F \u2208 FAT , then we could just relabel RT as\nR. We can assume that the facet with ones in the first column\n(the A in Eq. 9) gives the biggest inner product since\nTr(RT (Ci AC j )) = Tr(C j RT Ci A) = Tr((Ck RCl )T A).\n\n(18)\n\nThe proof will hinge on an entry of R, outside of the first\ncolumn, being larger than the rest of the elements outside the\nfirst column. As such, let us define 12 matrices closely related\nto A and call them A\u2032i :\nA\u20321 =\n\n1 \u22121 0\n1 0 0\n1 0 0\n\n!\n\nA\u20322 =\nA\u203212\n\n***\n\n=\n\n1 1 0\n1 0 0\n1 0 0\n\n!\n\n1 0 0\n1 0 0\n1 0 1\n\n!\n\nsuch that the index i largest inner product R * A\u2032i tells us the\nsign and location of the largest magnitude element outside the\nfirst column. Once again, symmetry allows us to assume that\nA\u20321 yields the largest inner product because the rest of the A\u2032i\ncan be derived from A\u20321 via Clifford rotations\n{A\u2032i }\n\n=\n\n(\n\n0 0 1\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n\n!j\n\nA\u20321\n\n1 0 0\n0 0 1\n0 \u22121 0\n\n!k\n\nj \u2208 {1, 2, 3}\nk \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\n)\n\n.\n\n(19)\nFor a matrix R to be an SO(3) rotation there are constraints\non the signs of the elements Ri, j i.e. there are 8 choices for the\nfirst column, 6 choices for the second column and 2 for the\nthird. Given that A is the maximum facet for R, we have fixed\nthe signs positively in the first column, reducing the number of\ntypes of rotation to 6 \u00d7 2 = 12. Since A\u20321 gives the maximum\ninner product with R of all A\u2032i we have that R1,2 < 0, which\nreduces the number of rotation types further to 3 \u00d7 2 = 6. It\n\n\f4\nUsing the relevant entries of R we define a pair of 2-vectors ~u\nand ~v as\n\n~u\n~u = (R1,1 , R1,2 ) ~v = (R2,3 , R3,3 )\n\n~v\n\n(22)\n\nthen we can rewrite the above inequality Eq. 21 as\nFIG. 2: Proof of Eq. 23: For any pair of 2-vectors ~u and ~v with the\nsame L2 norm, the vector with greater L\u221e norm has smaller L1 norm.\nA vector pointing towards the black dot has simultaneously minimal\nL\u221e norm and maximal L1 norm.\n\ncan be shown that R1,2 having larger magnitude than the rest\nof the elements Ri, j (i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, j \u2208 {2, 3}) restricts the type\nof rotation further to one the following four types\n(\uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6)\nR\u2208\n\n+ \u2212 +\n+ \u2212 \u2212\n+ \u2212 \u2212\n+ \u2212 +\n\uf8ed + + \u2212 \uf8f8,\uf8ed + + \u2212 \uf8f8,\uf8ed + + \u2212 \uf8f8,\uf8ed + \u2212 \u2212 \uf8f8\n+ + +\n+ + +\n+ \u2212 +\n+ + +\n\n.\n\nThis should not be surprising if one considers that\nR1,2 = \u2212(R2,1 R3,3 \u2212 R2,3R3,1 )\n\n(20)\n\nbecause of the structure of SO(3) matrices, and the sign patterns listed above ensure |R1,2 | is as large as possible.\nWe claim that the B \u2208 FB of Eq. 9 will suffice to prove the\ndesired inequality R * (B \u2212 A) \u2265 0, which reads in matrix form\n+ \u2212 *\n+ * \u2212\n+ * +\n\n!\n\n*\n\n\u22121 1 0\n0 0 \u22121\n0 0 1\n\n!\n\n\u2265 0.\n\n(21)\n\n[1] Michael A.

We showed that for any unitary 1-qubit gate\nundergoing depolarizing noise with rate p it holds that if its\nSO(3) representation M = (1 \u2212 p)R lies outside the Clifford\npolytope P , then it must be the case that there a facet B \u2208 FB\nsuch that M * B > 1. In turn, this means that if this noisy gate is\napplied to a Bell pair |\u03a6i = \u221a12 (|00i + |11i) and an appropriate stabilizer measurement is applied, then, conditionally on\nthe outcome of the measurement, one obtains a state that can\nbe transformed using Clifford gates into a single qubit state\nwith |y| + |z| > 1 in the Bloch ball representation. By the result of Reichardt [7] such states enable stabilizing operations\nto perform universal quantum computation.\nAcknowledgments.
