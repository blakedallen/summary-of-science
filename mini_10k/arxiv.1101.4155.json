The CDF definition of the underlying event is a simple tool in\norder to work, however detailed structure or information on off-jet particles cannot be\nobtained. On the other hand the definition is not capable to analyze more than 2-jet\nstructures. This motivate us to develop a new definition for the underlying event.\nTo enhance the information content to be extracted from underlying events, we modified the above CDF's definition introducing multiple surrounding belts (SB) around the\nidentified jets [2, 3]. This new definition is immediately leads a more detailed analysis\nof the underlying event, even in case of multiple jets. On the other hand, as a specific\ncase of our new method, one can get the originally extracted physical observables corresponding to the analysis based on the CDF-definition.\nIn this short contribution we present the basic properties of the two ways of defining\nunderlying event. We recall the original CDF-based and our new definition of the\nunderlying events, which will be compared. We used two physical quantities for our\ncomparison: (i) the average hadron multiplicity within the defined areas and (ii) the\nmean transverse momenta versus multiplicity in the given regions. Quantities were\ninvestigated for both definition in parallel.\nOur analysis is based on jet production and identification in proton-proton collisions\nat 7 TeV. We used the LHC10e14 jet-jet sample generated by PYTHIA6.2 [4] framework\nwith cone-based UA1 [5] jet finder.\n\n\fGENERALIZED DEFINITION OF THE UNDERLYING EVENT\nAny definition of underlying event should strongly depend on a jet-identification method\napplied in the analysis. There are various state-of-the-art development on this direction [7, 8], which are very promising. On the other hand there are still a problematics\nof these definitions \u2013 the strong process dependence. E.g. changing from proton-proton\nto nucleus-nucleus collisions need to re-tune the properties of the algorithms in order to\nfind and separate jets and the baseline/background of each event [9].\nThe CDF-based underlying event definition corresponds to the jet identification in\ncase of a one- (or two-) jet events. Near side jets easily define the toward and the opposite\naway regions of the event geometry. Our original concept was to improve the CDF-based\ndefinition on a two-folded way:\nto develope an underlying event definition which is capable to handle multijet\nevents.\n\u2022 to investigate the surrounding areas around identified jets, even without major\nchanges of the jet-findig parameters in a case of nucleus-nucleus collision.\n\u2022\n\nThese requirements are led us to the definition of surrounding belts on the basis of the\nevent-background such as 'underlying event', which completely satisfy our requirements\nabove.\nIn our method, we are using jet-finding algorithms also. We define jets, than based on\nthe physical properties of the concentrical surrounding belts and the remaining particle\nmultiplicities, a better background or baseline can be provided. On the other hand the\nanalysis of the surrounding area around the identified jets, can even give feedback on the\ngoodness of the jet finding parameters.\nOn Fig. 1 the visual comparison of the two definitions can be seen. Left side of\nthe figure is for the CDF-based definition, the right side displays the SB-based one.\nThe two definitions can be summarized in a following ways, using the azimuth, \u03a6 and\n(pseudo)rapidity, (\u03b7 or) y plane:\nCDF-based definition of the underlying event is based on the subtraction of two areas\nof the whole measured acceptance: one around the identified near jet (toward\nregion) and another to the opposite (away) direction. Both regions are \u2206\u03a6 \u00d7 \u2206\u03b7 slices of the measured acceptance around the near jet and to the opposite, with the\nfull \u2206\u03b7 range and \u2206\u03a6 = \u00b160o in azimuth.\nSB-based definition uses all identified jets of the event to subtract them from the background. Each jet can have an approximate dial-like area, p\naround which concentric\nbands (or rings) can be defined. If a jet cone angle, R = \u2206\u03a62 + \u2206\u03b7 2 is given, a\nfirst 'SB1 ' and a second 'SB2 ' surrounding belt can be defined for any jet with the\nthicknesses of \u03b4 RSB1 and \u03b4 RSB2 , respectively. Generally, \u03b4 RSBi = 0.1 with respect\nto the R \u2248 0.5 \u2212 1 values. It is easy to see our underlying event definition is no\nlonger jet-number dependent.\nFurthermore, increasing \u03b4 RSBi values, similar (but not the same) area can be covered as in the original CDF-based definition. In this way the two model can be\ncomparable too.\n\n\fFIGURE 1. The schematic view of the underlying event (UE) defined by the CDF (left panel) and the\nsurrounding belts (SB, right panel). Details are in the text. (Color online.)\n\nNow we investigate the basic properties of the areas and parallel the physical quantities for the selected regions.\n\nCOMPARISON OF UE DEFINITIONS\nHere we compare the details of the CDF- and surrounding belt (SB) based underlying\nevent definitions. For our test we used PYTHIA6-simulated [4] proton-proton collisions\n(Perugia-0 tune [6]), namely LHC10e14 jet-jet at 7 TeV center-of-mass energy with\n150, 000 events. This sample contains jets identified by UA1 method [5]. We restricted\nour analysis to the settings of pT HardMin = 10 GeV/c and pT HardMax = 20 GeV/c.\nPrimarily we investigated the multiplicities of various geometrical regions of the\ngenerated events based on the full sample. After applying UA1 jet finding algorithm to\nidentify jets, we compared the selected areas using both CDF- and SB-based definitions\nof the underlying events. On left panel of Fig. 2 we plotted the multiplicities, Ni of the\nCDF-selected areas versus the total event multiplicity. Here Ni refers for followings: the\nmultiplicities of the identified 'leading/near jet' (blue squares), the jet-excluded 'toward'\narea (green dots), the 'away' side area to the opposite direction (purple dots), and the\nCDF-defined underlying is event, 'transverse' (pink dots). The right side of the Fig. 2\nstands for the SB-based underlying event definition with more areas: the multiplicities of\nthe identified leading jet blue squares), the away side jet (blue dots), multiplicity for the\nsurrounding belts, SBlead,1 , SBlead,2 , SBaway,1 , and SBaway,2 are open red squares, open\npurple triangles, open red circles, open purple diamonds respectively.

More details are in the text. (Color online.)\n\ncrosses denote multiplicity for the newly defined underlying event U E2 outside all jets.\n(Note, all color in accordance with the areas of Fig 1 above.)\nFig. 2 shows multiplicity in almost all regions: Ni increases almost linearly with the\ntotal multiplicity, in the Ntot < 120 region of the event for both cases. In case of the CDFbased definition, the away region gives the biggest contribution, and the jet belongs to\nthe smallest one. The transverse (underlying event) area lies between the two extremal\ncontribution. Moreover, it is interesting to see, after excluding the jet from the toward\nregion, the remaining area has almost the same multiplicity as the underlying event.\nThis shows the goodness of the jet finding algorithms and the \"safety\" of the CDFbased underlying event definition (e.g. 1/3 of the whole acceptance far from any jetcontaminated areas).\nThe multiplicity relations of the SB-based definition differs from the CDF-based. The\nnear jet has the same contribution, away side jet and the SBi s have small fraction from\nthe Ntot \u2013 due to the small areas. On the other hand, the newly defined underlying event,\nU E2 dominates the event multiplicity since it has almost the whole acceptance.\nIn general the multiplicity fraction of the defined areas are almost proportional to the\ngeometrical surface, only the jet-content part violates this dependence, as Fig. 2 displays.\nThus, the SB-based U E2 has larger multiplicity comparing to the CDF-based one, which\nmight gives better statistics for an underlying event analysis.\nSecondly, the mean transverse momentum hpT i of the selected areas is investigated\nincluding especially the underlying event. We plotted the hpT i vs. the multiplicity of the\ntotal event, Ntot and the hpT i vs. multiplicity of the CDF-based and SB-based underlying\nevents.\nOn Fig. 3 we display the hpT i vs. the multiplicity of the total event, Ntot for both\nCDF-based (left panel) and SB-based (right panel) underlying event. We use the same\ncolor and mark encoding for the selected regions of the event as on Fig. 2 above.\nWe found the mean-pT distributions of the regions are similar in proton-proton collisions. The identified leading jet has the highest values hpT ileading jet \u223c 8 \u2212 9 GeV/c,\nwhich are decreasing to hpT ileading jet \u223c 5 \u2212 6 GeV/c as going to larger Ntot , for both\n\n\f<pT >i [GeV/c]\n\n<pT >i [GeV/c]\n\n10\n\nleading jet\ntowards\ntowards w/o jet\naway region (CDF)\ntransverse\n\n9\n8\n7\n\n10\n\n8\n7\n\n6\n\n6\n\n5\n\n5\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n0\n0\n\nleading jet\naway jet\nSBlead,1\nSBlead,2\nSBaway,1\nSBaway,2\nUE2\n\n9\n\n1\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n0\n0\n\n120\nNtot\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\nNtot\n\nFIGURE 3.

For the CDF-based definition this is similar to the\njet-excluded toward area also, and for the SB-based definition surrounding belts, SBi\nhave also similar, but a slightly higher hpT iSBi \u223c 1.0 GeV/c. Differences between the\nleft and the right panels are originating from the handling of the near and away side\njet. CDF-based definition contains the jet to the near (leading) direction, and fully or\npartially to the opposite away region: hpT itowards \u223c 2 \u2212 3 GeV/c and hpT iaway \u223c 1.5 \u2212 2\nGeV/c. SB-based case since away side jets were also identified, hpT iaway jet \u223c 2 \u2212 3\nGeV/c. We can state generally, both underlying-event definition give the same result and\nthey are differ only in the separation (or inclusion) of leading or away side jet to the\ngiven areas.\nleading jet\ntowards\ntowards w/o jet\naway region (CDF)\ntransverse\n\n9\n8\n7\n\n10\n\n8\n7\n\n6\n\n6\n\n5\n\n5\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\nNUE/CDF\n\nleading jet\naway jet\nSBlead,1\nSBlead,2\nSBaway,1\nSBaway,2\nUE2\n\n9\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\nNUE2\n\nFIGURE 4.

Here, the comparison shows slight\ndifference between the panels. A stronger decrease in the highest hpT i-content regions\npresent compared to Fig. 3. Furthermore, changing from Ntot to NUE/CDF and NUE2 the\nseparation of the curves are more clear in both cases, especially at the largest hpT i values. In parallel the mean-pT values for the underlying event are almost the same for the\naverage multiplicity events and slightly higher for the rare ones.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\u221a\nWe studied our new underlying event definition in s = 7 TeV proton-proton collisions\nwith 150,000 events. We investigated and compared the multiplicities and the mean-pT\nvs. multiplicities for the CDF-based and our SB-based definition.\nWe found the multiplicity fraction of the defined regions are almost proportional to the\ngeometrical surface, only the jet-content part differs, due to the separation (or inclusion)\nof the leading or away side jets. The SB-based underlying event, U E2 found to have\nlarger multiplicity comparing to the CDF-based, NUE/CDF one, which might gives better\nstatistics for the underlying event analysis.\nThe mean-pT vs. Ntot analysis led us to compare both definition on the same level.\nWe got the same dependence of the underlying event for both, CDF- and SB-based\ncases. On the other hand, the above mentioned jet and near/away-area handling leads to\ndifferences.\nFinally, we compared our definitions by the mean-pT vs. the self-defined underlying\nevent multiplicities, namely NUE/CDF and NUE2 . Our results have shown both definition\nis reliable, and \u2013 due to the generalized definition of the surrounding belt based underlying event \u2013 multiple jets and detailed analysis of the surrounding areas can be performed\nin the future.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by Hungarian OTKA NK77816, PD73596 and E\u00f6tv\u00f6s University.
