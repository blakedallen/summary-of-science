Gas remained neutral until the first luminous objects emerged at\nz \u223c 20\u221230, leading to the complete reionization of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at a later, yet unknown, epoch.\nThe investigation of the Dark Ages is one of the frontiers of modern cosmology and a new generation of radio\ninterferometers is currently in development to study the redshifted 21 cm hyperfine triplet-singlet level transition of the\nground state of neutral hydrogen. Instruments such as the\nLOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), the 21 Centimeter Array\n(21CMA), the Mileura Wide-field Array (MWA) and the\nSquare Kilometer Array (SKA), are expected to reach the\nsensitivity required to map the HI distribution at angular\nresolution of the order of a few arcminutes (e.g. Pen, Wu, &\nPeterson 2004; Bowman, Morales, & Hewitt 2005; Kassim\net al. 2004; Wyithe, Loeb, & Barnes 2005).\nThe main scientific goal of such instruments is to perform an accurate tomography of matter during these remote\ncosmic epochs, and reconstruct in detail the latest phases\nof the reionization history. However, this might not be the\nonly major achievement of such experiments. For example,\nc 0000 RAS\n\nan analysis of the features of HI 21 cm maps from the Dark\nAges could also allow to put constrains on the existence and\nnature of decaying and annihilating Dark Matter (DM). In\nfact, if DM actually decays or annihilates, the injection of\nhigh energy photons into the IGM would heat and ionize the\nneutral gas, leaving an imprint on the 21 cm background signal which could be directly observed (Shchekinov & Vasiliev\n2006; Furlanetto, Oh, & Pierpaoli 2006).\nThe importance of DM decays and annihilations on the\nreionization history has been analyzed in detail by several\nauthors. Most authors have come to the conclusion that the\neffects of DM on the overall reionization process are relatively small and they cannot compete with those induced\nby more conventional ionizing sources as stars and (mini-)\nquasars. However, as we will explain in detail later on, radiation from decaying/annihilating DM might change the\nthermal and ionization history of the gas to such an extent\nthat differences with the case in which DM is not considered\nare large enough to produce a clear signature in observable\n21 cm signal. Assessing the amplitude of these deviations\nfrom the standard scenario requires a careful study of complex physical processes, and in particular of the amount of\nenergy that can be transferred from the decay/annihilation\nproducts to the IGM. A recent study (Ripamonti, Mapelli,\n& Ferrara 2006a, hereafter RMF06a) finds that only a rela-\n\n\f2\n\nVald\u00e9s, Ferrara, Mapelli, Ripamonti\n\ntively small fraction of the injected energy is effectively absorbed by the IGM and goes into heating and reionization.\nAs a result, the effects on the 21 cm background signal might\nbe smaller than previously predicted (Shchekinov & Vasiliev\n2006; Furlanetto et al. 2006); hence, the question remains if\nthe DM signal can still be observed by next generation radio\ninterferometers. If so, this experiment would constitute a superb tool to distinguish among different DM candidates via\ntheir decaying/annihilating properties. In this paper we calculate the effects of DM decays/annihilations on the 21 cm\nbackground for some of the most popular DM candidates,\nsuch as decaying or annihilating Light Dark Matter (LDM)\nand decaying sterile neutrinos.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we\nbriefly introduce the DM candidates and their effect on the\nIGM; in Sec. 3 we provide the basic equations to study the\n21 cm radiation in presence of decaying/annihilating DM. In\nSec. 4 we present the results of our calculations, which are\nthen discussed in Sec. 5. Throughout the paper we assume,\nin agreement with the 3-yr WMAP data analysis (Spergel et\nal. 2006), a \u039bCDM cosmology with \u03a9m = 0.24, \u03a9\u039b = 0.76,\nh = 0.73, \u03a9b = 0.042, H0 = 100 h km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .\n\n2\n\nBASIC PHYSICS\n\nWe are interested in calculating the effects on HI 21 cm\nline signal produced by two among the most popular lowmass DM candidates, i.e. LDM (\u223c 1 \u2212 10 MeV) and sterile\nneutrinos (\u223c 2 \u2212 50 keV). In the case of sterile neutrinos\nonly the decay process is allowed; LDM particles instead\ncan both decay and annihilate. We neglect heavier DM candidates (with mass larger than \u223c 100 MeV) because previous studies (Mapelli, Ferrara & Pierpaoli 2006) have already\nshown that, even assuming that all the energy released following annihilations is immediately absorbed by the IGM,\nthey represent a negligible heating/ionization source for the\ngas.\nBoth in the case of sterile neutrinos and of LDM, the\nrate of energy transfer per baryon to the IGM can be written\nas (RMF06a; Ripamonti, Mapelli & Ferrara 2006b, hereafter\nRMF06b):\n\u0116x (z) = fabs (z) \u1e45DM (z) mDM c2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere mDM is the mass of the DM particle and c is the speed\nof light. The energy absorbed fraction, fabs (z), is discussed\nin detail in the following; \u1e45DM (z) is the decrease rate of the\nnumber of DM particles per baryon.\nIn the case of DM decays, \u1e45DM (z) is given by\n\u1e45DM (z) \u2243\n\nnDM,0\n,\n\u03c4DM\n\n(2)\n\nwhere nDM,0 and \u03c4DM are the current number of DM particles per baryon and the lifetime of DM particles, respectively.\nFor the annihilations:\n\u1e45DM (z) \u2243\n\n1 2\nNb (0) h\u03c3 vi(1 + z)3 ,\nn\n2 DM,0\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Nb (0) = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22127 cm\u22123 is the current baryon number density (Spergel et al. 2006), and h\u03c3vi is the thermallyaveraged DM annihilation cross section. The values of mDM ,\n\nnDM,0 , \u03c4DM and h\u03c3vi depend from the properties of the chosen DM candidate (see Secs. 2.1 and 2.3).\n\n2.1\n\nThe energy absorbed fraction\n\nThe most delicate term in eq. (1) is represented by fabs (z),\ni.e. the fraction of the DM particle rest mass that is absorbed by the gas at a given redshift z; fabs strongly depends on how the decay/annihilation products interact with\nthe IGM. Since accounting for the physical processes which\ngovern such interactions is quite complicated, most of previous studies assume that: (i) all the energy released by\nDM decays/annihilations is immediately absorbed (Hansen\n& Haiman 2004; Pierpaoli 2004; Biermann & Kusenko 2006;\nMapelli et al. 2006), (ii) leave fabs as a free parameter (Padmanabhan & Finkbeiner 2005; Zhang et al. 2006), or (iii)\nmake a partial treatment of the energy redistribution (Chen\n& Kamionkowski 2004; Mapelli & Ferrara 2005).\nRecently, RMF06a have calculated behaviour of fabs (z)\nin detail, for the most common case in which the decay/annihilation products are photons, active neutrinos or\nelectron-positron pairs. Photons are affected by Compton\nscattering and photo-ionization; for pairs, the relevant processes are inverse Compton scattering, collisional ionizations, and positron annihilations.\nRMF06a found that, if the decay/annihilation products\nare either photons and active neutrinos or pairs, fabs is close\nto the maximum allowed value (equal to 0.5 for sterile neutrinos, due to the active neutrino production, and equal to\n1 for LDM) only at very high redshift (z \u226b 100). At lower\nredshifts, fabs rapidly drops to values < 0.1; also, the higher\nis the mass of the progenitor DM particle, the faster is the\ndecrease of fabs . Thus, accounting for the correct fabs (z) determination dramatically reduces the possible effects of DM\ndecays and annihilations on the IGM heating and ionization\n(RMF06a) with respect to previous estimates.\nIn this paper, for the first time, we will adopt the correct\nestimate of fabs (z) (as given in RMF06a) in order to evaluate the impact of DM decays and annihilations on 21 cm\nemission. Previous papers (e.g. Furlanetto et al. 2006) have\nassumed a redshift-independent fabs (z), which appears to be\nquite unrealistic (for a discussion, see Sec. 4) and leads to\noptimistic upper limits for the contribution of DM-related\neffects to 21 cm maps.\nDifferently from Furlanetto et al. 2006, who do not select any specific DM candidate and leave the decay rate as a\nfree parameter, we chose to consider three specific DM candidates (sterile neutrinos, decaying LDM and annihilating\nLDM). This choice allows us to give predictions which can\nbe more easily related to other DM measurements, such as\nthe X-ray constraints on the sterile neutrino mass (Watson\net al. 2006; Boyarsky et al. 2006a) or the detection of the\n511-keV emission line from the Galactic center (Kn\u00f6dlseder\net al. 2005).\n\n2.2\n\nSterile neutrinos\n\nMany models of sterile neutrinos have been proposed, with\nmass ranging from eV to TeV. Here, we are interested in sterile neutrinos as warm DM (WDM) candidates, with masses\nof the order of a few keV (\u223c 2 \u2212 50 keV).

Other constraints come from the comparison between the unresolved X-ray background and the\nexpected contribution from sterile neutrino decays (Mapelli\n& Ferrara 2005; Boyarsky et al. 2006a).\nIn this paper we consider the representative case of\nm\u03bd = 25 keV sterile neutrinos, whose contribution to heating is maximum (RMF06a), due to the weakness of the\navailable constraints on lifetime for neutrinos of such mass.\nFor such particle the upper limits on the lifetime and the\npresent number density number per baryon are \u03c4 DM =\n9.67 \u00d7 1025 s and nDM,0 = 1.88 \u00d7 105 , respectively (see\nRMF06a, RMF06b). The contribution of other sterile neutrinos masses to the 21 cm line is expected to be comparable\nor smaller than for the case considered here.\n\n2.3\n\nLight dark matter\n\nWe define as LDM particles all the DM candidates whose\nmass is 1 \u2264 mLDM /MeV \u2264 100. Such particles have been\nsuggested as a possible source for the detected 511-keV excess from the Galactic centre (Kn\u00f6dlseder et al. 2005). According to this scenario, their maximum allowed mass mLDM\nshould be 20 MeV, not to overproduce detectable gamma\nrays via internal bremsstrahlung (Beacom, Bell & Bertone\n2004), or even \u223c 3 MeV, if we consider also the production of\ngamma rays for inflight annihilations of the positrons (Beacom & Y\u00fcksel 2006).\nLDM can decay or annihilate, producing photons, neutrinos and pairs. We will treat both channels in detail and\nassume that the only decay/annihilation products are pairs,\nan assumption leading to an upper limit in terms of IGM\nheating (RMF06a).\nWe consider, as a template, the case of 10-MeV LDM\nparticles, which again yields the most efficient heating case\n(see RMF06a). For such particles the upper limits of the\ncurrent number (per baryon), the lifetime and the crosssection are nDM,0 \u223c 446, \u03c4 DM = 4 \u00d7 1025 s, and h\u03c3vi \u223c\n2.4 \u00d7 10\u221228 cm3 s\u22121 , respectively (RMF06a).\n\n3\n\n0.068 K is the temperature corresponding to the transition\nenergy.\nIn the presence of the Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) alone, the spin temperature reaches thermal equilibrium with TCMB = 2.73(1 + z) K on a short time-scale,\nmaking the HI undetectable in emission or absorption.\nTwo mechanisms can decouple TS from TCMB : (i) collisions, which are effective mainly at z \u2265 70 due to the higher\nmean IGM density, and (ii) scattering by Ly\u03b1 photons \u2212 the\nso-called Wouthuysen-Field process or Ly\u03b1 pumping (e.g.\nWouthuysen 1952; Field 1959; Hirata 2005) \u2212 which couples TS to the kinetic gas temperature TK via the mixing of\nthe hyperfine levels of the HI ground state through intermediate transitions to the excited 2p state.\nThe spin temperature is then given by the equation:\nTS =\n\nTCM B + y\u03b1 Tk + yc Tk\n1 + y\u03b1 + yc\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Tk is the kinetic temperature, and the Ly\u03b1 and collisional coupling coefficients are given by the following expressions:\nP10 T\u2217\n,\nA10 Tk\nC10 T\u2217\nyc =\n,\nA10 Tk\nwhere\ny\u03b1 =\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nC10 = k10 nHI + ne \u03b3e ,\n\n(8)\n\nand\nP10 =\n\n16 \u03c0J\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1\n.\n27 hp \u03bd\u03b1\n\n(9)\n\nIn the above equations A10 = 2.85 \u00d7 10\u221215 s\u22121 is the spontaneous emission coefficient of the 21 cm line, P10 is the\nindirect de-excitation rate of the hyperfine structure levels.\nWe write P10 = 4P\u03b1 /27; in addition, P\u03b1 = (4\u03c0J\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1 )/(hp \u03bd\u03b1 )\nis the outcome of the equation for the Ly\u03b1 scattering rate,\nP\u03b1 = c\n\nZ\n\nd\u03bd n(\u03bd)\n\n\u03c3(\u03bd)\n4\u03c0\n=\n\u03bd\nh\n\nZ\n\nd\u03bd\n\nJ\u03bd \u03c3(\u03bd)\n,\n\u03bd\n\n(10)\n\nin the case that \u03c3(\u03bd) is a \u03b4 function.

If TS is higher than TCMB , the neutral IGM will\nbe visible in emission against the CMB; on the contrary, if\nTS < TCMB it will be visible in absorption.\n\n4\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn a Universe where DM does not decay or annihilate the\nspin temperature and the kinetic temperature of the gas\ntrack the CMB temperature down to z \u2248 300, when the\nkinetic temperature starts to decrease adiabatically, TK \u221d\n(1 + z)2 , while TCM B \u221d (1 + z). The collisions at this redshift are efficient at coupling TS and TK : the spin temperature subsequently tracks the kinetic temperature down to\nz \u223c 70. At lower redshifts radiative coupling to the CMB\nbecomes dominant and TS \u2192 TCM B again. As a result, for\n30 \u2264 z \u2264 300 HI is visible in absorption against the CMB at\nwavelength of 21 (1+z) cm. This scenario could change considerably if we allow for DM decay/annihilation, depressing\nor even erasing the absorption feature discussed above. Also,\nwe note that different DM candidates leave different traces\non the 21 cm background signal, and therefore it could be\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\npossible, in principle, to constrain directly the DM nature\nthrough 21 cm observations. To isolate the effect of DM,\nwe will assume in the following that the entire cosmic dark\nmatter content is constituted by particles of the considered\ntype (sterile neutrinos or LDM), i.e. \u03a9X = \u03a9m \u2212 \u03a9b .\n\n4.1\n\nWDM: 25-keV sterile neutrino decay\n\nIn Fig. 1 we compare the effects of 25-keV sterile neutrino\ndecays on TS assuming either the physically motivated value\nof fabs (left panel) or the commonly adopted value fabs = 0.5\n(right panel), i.e. the maximum allowed value for sterile neutrinos corresponding to complete absorption. In addition, in\neach of the panels we explore the differences between models with or without the energy injection term due to DM\ndecays. We will refer in the following to the latter as the\nstandard case, for brevity.\nWith respect to the case without DM energy injection,\nwe find, independently of the assumption made for fabs , a\nhigher kinetic temperature and hydrogen ionization fraction.\nHowever, such an enhancement produces only very modest\nTS differences with respect to the standard case, which has\nsome effect on the differential brightness temperature \u03b4Tb .\nThe difference TS \u2212 TCM B remains extremely small due to\nthe limited ability of the Ly\u03b1 pumping to decouple the two\ntemperatures.\nThe main difference between the results obtained from\nthe two fabs assumptions is the behavior of TK at z \u223c 10\u221270.\nWhen we use the realistic fabs value, the IGM kinetic temperature positively deviates at most by 50% from its standard\nevolution; if instead fabs = 0.5 is adopted (e.g. as assumed\nfor example by Furlanetto et al. 2006), the kinetic temperature overshoots the CMB one and reaches very large values\n(> 100 K) at low redshifts.\n\n\f6\n\nVald\u00e9s, Ferrara, Mapelli, Ripamonti\n\nFigure 3.

The lines are the same as in the left panel.\n\n4.2\n\nLDM: 10-MeV decay/annihilation\n\nWe now turn to the analysis of LDM candidates. Following\nthe same procedure as in the previous Section we compare\nthe results of the two different assumptions for fabs (note\nthat for LDM, the constant absorbed fraction case corresponds to fabs = 1, see Sec. 2.1), and also test the effects of\ndecays/annihilation against the standard case.\nWe start from the analysis of the realistic fabs case (Fig.\n2, left panel) for decaying LDM. The most striking feature\nis that the evolution of TK decouples from the adiabatic one\nalready at z \u2248 50, and starts to increase below z \u2248 20,\nreaching TK = 30 K at z = 10. Such thermal history forces\nTS to remain below TCM B for a much longer redshift interval\n(down to z = 10) than in the standard case, in which TS \u2248\nTCM B already at z \u2248 25. Interestingly, this effect extends\nthe frequency range in which the IGM can be observed in\nabsorption to higher values. The main physical reason for the\nlarger impact of LDM decays on TS with respect to sterile\nneutrinos analyzed above basically lies in the larger fabs\nvalue (approximately a factor of 10 below z = 30) of LDM\nparticles; this is on top of their larger rest mass. The higher\nheating rate increases both TK and the Ly\u03b1 background (i.e.\ny\u03b1 ), thus pushing TS away from TCM B .\nWhen fabs is instead artificially forced to be constant\nand equal to unity (Fig. 2, right panel), the physical arguments given above can still be used to interpret the results,\nbut the deviation from the standard case is much more dramatic, and results in an overestimate of the LDM decays impact. For example, TK becomes larger than TCM B already\nat z \u2248 50 and stays above it thereafter, reaching > 1000 K\nat z = 10. The increase is so strong that it essentially erases\nthe absorption feature expected in the standard case above\nz = 30. The IGM according to this prescription should be\nobserved in emission up to very high redshifts.\n\nFor comparison sake, we note that this case has nearly\nthe same decay rate, \u0393X = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u221226 s\u22121 , as that assumed\nin one of the cases explored by Furlanetto et al. (2006) (dotdashed line in Fig. 1 of that paper). Consistently, the evolution of TK from the two studies is essentially the same.\nFinally we turn to the case of annihilating LDM (Fig.\n3). As usual, the left panel of that figure reports the case\nin which the realistic, redshift dependent, values of fabs are\nassumed. In this case, the kinetic temperature deviates from\nthe standard adiabatic evolution at extremly high redshifts\n(z > 200): this is because the annihilation process depends\non the square of the baryon density. As a result, its contribution predominantly occurs at early epochs and progressively\nvanishes with time, as realized also from the fact that below z = 100 the TK curve is simply shifted to an higher\nadiabat. This fact causes the spin temperature to remain\ncloser to (although always lower than) TCM B , thus preserving the standard absorption feature. Quite remarkably the\nresults assuming the realistic fabs values do not differ appreciably from those obtained by imposing fabs = 1 (Fig.\n3, right panel). As pointed out before, the effects of annihilating DM are evident only at very high redshift, where\nthe detailed calculation gives fabs \u2248 1 (see RFM06a), thus\nmaking the non-evolving fabs approximation acceptable.\n\n4.3\n\nGlobal 21 cm background.\n\nHaving obtained the evolution of TS for the different DM\ncandidates, we are now ready to compute for each case the\nquantity that is most readily associated with observations,\ni.e. the differential brightness temperature, \u03b4Tb . These are\nshown in Fig. 4 for the realistic (left panel) and the constant fabs (right panel) cases, respectively. In addition, to\nfacilitate the comparison, we have also plotted in Fig. 5 the\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fConstraining DM through 21 cm observations\n\n7\n\nFigure 4. Left panel: 21 cm differential brightness temperature as a function of redshift. The solid line shows \u03b4Tb without decaying/annihilating DM; while the long dashed, short dashed and dotted lines refer to \u03b4Tb with 25-keV decaying WDM, 10-MeV decaying\nLDM and 10-MeV annihilating LDM, respectively. Calculations were performed assuming fabs as in RMF06a. Right: 21 cm differential\nbrightness temperature as a function of redshift as in the left panel. Calculations were performed assuming fabs = 0.5 for sterile neutrinos\nand fabs = 1 in the other cases.\n\nbrightness temperature deviation \u03b4Tb \u2212 \u03b4Tb,0 of the various\nmodels from the standard one, restricted to the realistic fabs\nevolution only.\nAs usual, we start our analysis from the realistic fabs\ncase. For sterile neutrinos (long-dashed curves) the characteristic absorption feature in the 21 cm background signal\nexpected at 30 \u2264 z \u2264 300 is only slightly modified from the\nstandard case (solid line): the maximum difference is found\nto be only \u2248 \u22122 mK in the range z \u223c10\u221240. Yet, such a\nsmall signature of WDM decays could still be in principle observable: even modest sized single-dish radio telescopes can\nreach the required mK sensitivity in an all sky observation.\nThe real challenge for the observation is represented by the\nability to disentangle this cosmological signal from the various foregrounds (particularly the Galactic synchrotron emission) which could be several orders of magnitude brighter.\nThe case of decaying 10-MeV LDM (short-dashed lines in\nFig.4) is more interesting, as the difference with the standard case are larger. For this case we find that the deviation\nis predicted to be \u2248 \u2212(5\u22128) mK in the range 20 < z < 40.\nSuch an amplitude could be detected by LOFAR or SKA\nafter a 1000 hour all sky integration and by most single\ndish radio telescopes, provide foreground contamination is\ntaken care of. Finally, when LDM annihilations are considered, a considerably different \u03b4Tb evolution is obtained with\nrespect to the standard case. Larger deviations are present\nin the entire range 40 < z < 200, where the energy input of LDM annihilations forces \u03b4Tb to values larger than\n\u221220 mK, about two times smaller (in absolute value) than\nfor the standard evolution. Such a large difference could in\nprinciple facilitate discriminating the annihilation scenario\nfrom the standard one. In practice, though, foregrounds and\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nionospheric contamination become more severe at the low\nobserving frequencies implied by these high redshifts.\nAlthough of academic interest only, it is instructive to\ncompare the constant fabs cases (Fig. 4, right panel) with\nthe previous results. As seen clearly form the Figure, considerably different conclusions would be drawn. First, sterile\nneutrino would drive \u03b4Tb to positive values, resulting in an\nemission signal below z = 20; a similar trend is also obtained\nfor LDM decays, whose effects are seen in 21 cm emission\nwith an amplitude of about 10 mK. The results for LDM\nannihilation instead do not show appreciable dependencies\non the fabs prescription, for the reasons discussed above.\n\n5\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nFrom the results obtained in this paper, we conclude that\nit is in principle possible to observe the HI 21 cm signal\nfrom the Dark Ages produced by the energy input due to\ndecays/annihilations of the most popular light/warm DM\ncandidates. If so, radio observations might represent one of\nthe most promising tools to study the nature of DM, as different particles are predicted to leave a specific signature\non the signal. The sensitivity required to measure the 21 cm\nbackground signal can be achieved not only by the next generation of radio interferometers, but also by existing radio\nobservatories.\nHowever, the various foregrounds (i.e. Galactic freefree and synchrotron emission, unresolved extra-galactic radio sources, free-free emission from ionizing sources, synchrotron emission from cluster radio halos and relics) are\nmuch stronger than the cosmological signal, and will cer-\n\n\f8\n\nVald\u00e9s, Ferrara, Mapelli, Ripamonti\n\ntainly prove extremely difficult to remove. Hence, a clear\ndetection could be challenging to achieve.\nIt is beyond the scope of this paper to deal in detail\nwith the problems of ionospheric scintillation and foreground\ncontamination. A number of studies have discussed the foregrounds complications in some detail (e.g. Shaver et al. 1999;\nOh & Mack 2003; Di Matteo, Ciardi & Miniati 2004) and\nwe refer the reader to those papers for more information.\nFor our aims it is sufficient to say that in general the sky\ntemperature can be roughly described as:\nTsky \u223c 180\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03bd\n180MHz\n\n\u0011\u22122.6\n\nK\n\n(20)\n\n(see e.g. Furlanetto, Oh & Briggs 2006) and is, at the frequencies of interest, several orders of magnitude higher than\nthe cosmological 21 cm background signal.\nThe success of the 21 cm background observations\nto constrain DM will depend on the capability of effectively removing the foregrounds and of correcting for ionospheric variations (e.g. Gnedin & Shaver 2004; Zaldarriaga,\nFurlanetto & Hernquist 2004; Santos, Cooray & Knox 2005;\nMorales, Bowman & Hewitt 2005).\nAn alternative method to study the 21 cm backgrounds\nis by separating its spectral features from the smooth foreground spectrum (e.g. Furlanetto 2006, Shaver et al. 1999).\nFig. 6 shows the gradient of \u03b4Tb for the DM candidates\nstudied here. It is clear from the figure that the gradients\nare higher and easier to constrain in the frequency range\n\u03bd = 1420/(1 + z)MHz \u223c 10\u221240 MHz. The foreground gradients however increase with decreasing frequency making\nit difficult to predict the best frequencies to get to for a\nsuccessful detection.\nDiscriminating among different DM cases would imply\nthe ability to distinguish the difference in brightness temperature and/or in its gradient with respect to the standard scenario. We define these two quantities as \u2206\u03b4Tb = \u03b4Tb \u2212 \u03b4Tb 0\nand \u2206\u03b4Tb /\u2206\u03bd = d\u03b4Tb /d\u03bd \u2212d\u03b4Tb 0 /d\u03bd, where the 0 stands for\nthe standard (i.e. non decaying/annihilating) DM scenario.\nFig. 7 shows \u2206\u03b4Tb versus \u2206\u03b4Tb /\u2206\u03bd for the three DM\nmodels: the blue triangles correspond to 10-MeV annihilations, the red squares to 10-MeV decays and the black stars\nto the 25-keV sterile neutrino decays. The points are separated by 1 MHz steps in a range that goes from 5 to 130\nMHz. As the sensitivity is somewhat uncertain for the different proposed 21 cm experiments, we assume as a guideline that a successful detection requires \u2206\u03b4Tb > 3 mK and\n\u2206\u03b4Tb /\u2206\u03bd > 0.6 mK/MHz, respectively. The adopted value\nfor \u2206\u03b4Tb is a conservative one given that mK sensitivities\nare already achievable in all sky observations even by existing single dish radio telescopes. It has been chosen so to\npartially take into consideration the difficulties associated\nwith foregrounds removal.\nThe shaded area covers the parameter space corresponding to likely non-detections. For the 25-keV sterile neutrinos case the points lie almost entirely within the shaded\narea, thus future observations would hardly be able to pin\ndown this scenario.\nIn the case of decaying or annihilating 10-MeV LDM\npositive detections could be achieved on different frequency\nranges. For the decays the ideal frequencies to study would\n>\n4 mK, and 80\u221290 MHz,\nbe 40\u221280 MHz, where \u2206\u03b4Tb \u223c\n>\nwhere \u2206\u03b4Tb \u223c 2 mK but \u2206\u03b4Tb /\u2206\u03bd \u223c\n0.6 mK/MHz. At\n\nFigure 5. 21 cm differential brightness temperature difference\nin mK between the three DM cases considered and a non\ndecaying\u2212annihilating DM scenario. The dashed, solid and dotted lines correspond to 25-kev sterile neutrino decays, 10-Mev\nLDM decays and 10-MeV annihilations case respectively.\n\n\u03bd \u2265 90 MHz, or z \u2264 15 the first luminous sources start\nhaving a dominant impact on the IGM and the small modifications from decaying/annihilating DM would not be visible.\nFor the 10-MeV LDM annihilations case the best observing frequencies seem to be 10\u221230 MHz. At these fre>\nquencies \u2206\u03b4Tb \u223c\n6 mK with a peak of over 20 mK at\n10\u221220 MHz. Observations at such low frequencies are particularly difficult and probably future radio interferometers\nwill not reach such large wavelengths. Probably 30 MHz is\nthe minimum frequency which will be achieved by next generation instruments, and the frequency at which it will then\nbe possible to constrain 10-MeV annihilating LDM.\nWe conclude then that it is likely that future observations of the 21 cm background radiation will allow us to effectively constrain among some of the DM candidates, which\nby decays or annihilations can influence deeply the properties of the IGM.\nNevertheless our study shows that accounting for the\nphysical evolution of fabs (z) strongly reduces the amplitude\nof DM effects on the IGM with respect to those predicted by\nprevious studies: for example we find that the effect of 25keV decaying sterile neutrinos would be hardly observable.\n\nREFERENCES\nAbazajian K., 2006, PhRvD, 73f, 3506\nAbazajian K., Fuller G.
