This\nis because the original growth problem has turned out\nto be equivalent to other important physical phenomena,\nsuch as the randomly stirred fluid (Burgers equation) [3],\ndirected polymers in random media (DPRM) [4], dissipative transport [5, 6] or magnetic flux lines in superconductors [7]. The KPZ equation has thus emerged as one\nof the fundamental theoretical models for the study of\nuniversality classes in non-equilibrium scaling phenomena and phase transitions [2].\nIt is a non-linear Langevin equation which describes\nthe large-distance, long-time dynamics of the growth process specified by a single-valued height function h(x, t) on\na d-dimensional substrate x \u2208 IRd :\n\u00012\n\u2202t h(x, t) = \u03bd \u22072 h(x, t) + \u03bb/2 \u2207h(x, t) + \u03b7(x, t), (1)\n\nwhere \u03b7(x, t) is a zero mean uncorrelated noise with variance h\u03b7(x, t)\u03b7(x\u2032 , t\u2032 )i = 2D\u03b4 d (x \u2212 x\u2032 ) \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ). This equation reflects the competition between the surface tension\nsmoothing force \u03bd\u22072 h, the preferential growth along the\nlocal normal to the surface represented by the non-linear\nterm and the Langevin noise \u03b7 which tends to roughen\nthe interface and mimics the stochastic nature of the\ngrowth.\nThe stationary interface is characterized by the twopoint correlation function C(|x \u2212 x\u2032 |, t \u2212 t\u2032 ) \u2261 h[h(x, t) \u2212\nh(x\u2032 , t\u2032 )]2 i and, in particular, its large-scale properties\nwhere C is expected to assume the scaling form C(d, \u03c4 ) =\nd2\u03c7 f ( d\u03c4z ), where d = |x \u2212 x\u2032 | , \u03c4 = |t \u2212 t\u2032 | and \u03c7 and\nz are the roughness and dynamical exponents respectively. These two exponents are not independent since\nthe Galilean symmetry [3] - the invariance of Eq. (1)\nunder an infinitesimal tilting of the interface - enforces\nthe scaling relation z + \u03c7 = 2 for solutions associated\nwith any fixed point at which \u03bb is non-zero.\nWhile some exact results are available in d = 1, yielding \u03c7 = 1/2 and z = 3/2 [2, 4, 8], the complete theoretical understanding of the KPZ equation in higher dimensions is still lacking. For d > 2, there exists a phase\n\ntransition between two different regimes, separated by a\ncritical value \u03bbc of the non-linear coefficient [1, 3]. In\nthe weak-coupling regime (\u03bb < \u03bbc ), the behavior is governed by the \u03bb = 0 fixed point - corresponding to the\nlinear Edwards-Wilkinson equation [2] - with exponents\n\u03c7 = (2 \u2212 d)/d and z = 2. In the strong-coupling (rough)\nregime (\u03bb > \u03bbc ), the non-linearity becomes relevant and\ndespite considerable efforts, the statistical properties of\nthe strong-coupling (rough) regime for d \u2265 2 remain controversial.\nThe existence of a finite upper critical dimension dc at\nwhich the dynamical exponent z of the strong-coupling\nphase becomes 2 is also much debated. Most of the analytical approaches support a finite dc , but their predictions are varied: one of the solutions of the modecoupling (MC) equations and other arguments indicate\ndc \u2243 4 [9, 10, 11, 12], whereas functional renormalization group to two-loop order suggests dc \u2243 2.5 [13]. A\nset of related theories such as replica symmetry breaking [14], variational studies [15] and Flory-Imry-Ma arguments [16] give dc = 2. On the other hand, numerical\nsimulations and real space calculations find no evidence\nat all for a finite dc [17, 18, 19]!\nWe re-examine in this paper MC theory. It is a selfconsistent approximation [5, 6], where in the diagrammatic expansion for the correlation and response functions only diagrams which do not renormalize the threepoint vertex \u03bb are retained. The MC approximation has\nbeen widely studied [8, 9, 11, 20, 21]. Furthermore the\nMC equations are exact for the large N -limit of a generalised N -component KPZ [20]. This allows in principle\nfor a systematic expansion in 1/N . We shall show that\nwithin the MC approximation there exists two solutions,\none of which had been previously overlooked. The new\nsolution (universality class) only exists when d < 2 and\nseems similar to the solution found in the analytical studies which give dc = 2 [14, 15, 16]. The other MC solution\nexists on the whole range 0 < d < 4 and has dc = 4.\nThis previously known solution gives in d = 2 a value for\nz close to that from numerical work, e.g. [18].\nThe correlation and response functions are defined\nin Fourier space by C(k, \u03c9) = hh(k, \u03c9)h\u2217 (k, \u03c9)i and\n\n\f2\nD \u2202h(k, \u03c9) E\n, where h*i in\u2202\u03b7(k \u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032 )\ndicates an average over \u03b7. In the MC approximation, the\ncorrelation and response functions are the solutions of\ntwo coupled equations,\nZ\nZ\ndd q\nd\u03a9\n2\nq * (k \u2212 q)\nG\u22121 (k, \u03c9) = G\u22121\n(k,\n\u03c9)\n+\n\u03bb\n0\n2\u03c0\n(2\u03c0)d\n\u00d7 (q * k) G(k \u2212 q, \u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9) C(q, \u03a9)\n(2)\nZ\nZ\nd\n\u03bb2\nd\nq\nd\u03a9\n2\nC(k, \u03c9) = C0 (k, \u03c9) +\nG(k, \u03c9)\n2\n2\u03c0\n(2\u03c0)d\nG(k, \u03c9)\u03b4 d (k \u2212 k \u2032 )\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2032 ) =\n\n\u00d7 (q * (k \u2212 q))2 C(k \u2212 q, \u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9) C(q, \u03a9) (3)\nwhere G0 (k, \u03c9) = (\u03bdk 2 \u2212 i\u03c9)\u22121 is the bare response\nfunction, and C0 (k, \u03c9) = 2D|G(k, \u03c9)|2 [9]. In the scaling limit, G(k, \u03c9) and C(k, \u03c9) take the forms G(k, \u03c9) =\nk \u2212z g (\u03c9/k z ) and C(k, \u03c9) = k \u2212(2\u03c7+d+z) n (\u03c9/k z ) and Eqs.\n(2) and (3) translate into coupled equations for the scaling functions n(x) and g(x):\ng \u22121 (x) = \u2212ix + I1 (x) ,\nn(x) = |g(x)|2 I2 (x) ,\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nwhere x = \u03c9/k z and I1 (x) and I2 (x) are given by [9]\nZ \u03c0\nZ \u221e\nd\u22122\nI1 (x) = P\nd\u03b8 sin\n\u03b8\ndq cos \u03b8(cos \u03b8 \u2212 q)\n0\n\u0013\nZ \u221e 0 \u0012\nx \u2212 qz y\n2z\u22123 \u2212z\nn(y),\n\u00d7q\nr\ndy g\nrz\n\u2212\u221e\nZ \u221e\nZ \u03c0\nP\ndq(cos \u03b8 \u2212 q)2\nd\u03b8 sind\u22122 \u03b8\nI2 (x) =\n2 0\n0\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\nx \u2212 qz y\n2z\u22123 \u2212(d+4\u2212z)\nn(y),\n\u00d7q\nr\ndy n\nrz\n\u2212\u221e\n(d+3)/2\nwith P = \u03bb2 /(2d \u0393( d\u22121\n), r2 = 1 + q 2 \u2212 2q cos \u03b8.\n2 )\u03c0\nNotice that the \"bare term\" C0 (k, \u03c9) has been dropped\nfrom these equations as it is negligible in the scaling limit\nprovided 2\u03c7 + d + z > 2z, i.e. 4 + d > 3z.\nAll the (necessarily approximate) solutions of the MC\nequations involve an ansatz on the form of the scaling\nfunctions n(x) and g(x). The relation z = z(d) is then\nobtained requiring consistency of Eqs. (4) and (5) on\nmatching both sides at an arbitrarily chosen value of x.\nDue to the non-locality of Eqs. (4) and (5), the matching condition depends on the form of the functions n and\ng for all x, so the ansatz needs to be reliable for all x,\nand in particular satisfy the large x asymptotic forms\nn(x) \u223c x\u22121\u2212\u03b2/z , gR (x) \u223c x\u22121\u22122/z and gI (x) \u2192 x\u22121\nwhere \u03b2 = d + 4 \u2212 2z and g(x) = gR (x) + igI (x). Colaiori and Moore [11, 12] proposed an ansatz which satisfies these large x constraints. It enabled the authors\nto provide numerical estimates of z when d = 2, 3 in reasonable agreement with exponents obtained from simulations [17, 18]. It also yielded an integer finite upper critical dimension dc = 4 [11]. Moreover, it led in d = 1 to\n\nthe discovery of a stretched exponential behavior for the\ntwo-point correlation function [12] similar to that found\nin the exact solution [22].\nUsing a similar ansatz, we next show that Eqs. (4)\nand (5) have an additional solution with dc = 2, before\ndiscussing its significance. The advocated ansatz is most\nconveniently expressed in Fourier space,\ngb(p) = \u03b8(p) exp(\u2212|p|2/z ) ,\n\nn\nb(p) = A exp(\u2212 Bp\n\n\u03b2/z\n\n),\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nwhere n\nb and gb are the Fourier transform of n(x) and g(x)\nrespectively, A is a (nonzero) parameter and B \u2261 B(d, z)\nan arbitrary function [11].

(4) and (5) at large x then yields:\nCd A B \u22121 = d (2 \u2212 z)/(z 2 I(B, d, z))\n\n(8)\n\nCd A B \u22122 = (\u03b2/z)2 (\u03b2 \u2212 z) 2\n\n(9)\n\n2z\u2212\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\n2z \u2212 \u03b2 \u0001\n/\u0393\n\u03b2\n\nd+1\n\nwhere Cd Z= \u03bb2 \u0393((d \u2212 1)/2)/(4 \u03c0 2 \u0393(d \u2212 1)) and\n\u221e\n\u0001\nI(B, d, z) =\nds B (1 \u2212 2s2 )s2z\u22123 exp \u2212 B \u03b2/z s\u03b2 \u2212 s2 .\n0\n\nCombining (8) and (9) then gives an implicit equation\nfor the curve z(d) depending on B only:\n\u03b2 2 (\u03b2 \u2212 z)\n\nd (2 \u2212 z)\n2(2z\u2212\u03b2)/\u03b2\n.\n\u0001 I(B, d, z) =\n2z\u2212\u03b2\nB\n\u0393 \u03b2\n\n(10)\n\nEq. (10) can be solved numerically once B(d, z) has been\nfixed. Prior to discussing the choice of B, we stress the\n(B-independent) intrinsic properties of the solutions Sd,z .\nFirst, as z \u2192 2, I(B, d, 2) is finite for any B > 0. One\ncan then infer from Eq. (10) that S2,2 and S4,2 are always solutions independent of B (provided B \u22121 is finite).\nThis singles out the two dimensions dc = 2 and dc = 4\nas critical ones since z \u2192 2 for d \u2192 dc . Second, as\nd \u2192 0, I(B, 0, z) is non-zero for any B > 0, and Eq.\n(10) yields the two solutions S0,4/3 and S0,1 (provided\nagain B \u22121 is finite). Lastly, as the MC equations satisfy\nthe fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) that exists in\nd = 1 [21] yielding the exact result z = 3/2, we expect\nthe ansatz to preserve this property, which is fulfilled\nfor B(1, 3/2) = 1 as can be checked on Eqs. (6) and\n(7). It follows that S1,3/2 is solution of (10). To summarize, Eq. (10) has five intrinsic solutions Sd,z which do\nnot depend on the choice of B (provided B \u22121 < \u221e and\nB(1, 3/2) = 1).\nFurthermore, Eq. (8) provides additional constraints\non B(d, z) in the two limits z \u2192 2 and d \u2192 0. As\nI(B, d, 2) is finite as z \u2192 2, the right-hand side of (8)\nvanishes identically, which forces B \u22121 \u223c (2 \u2212 z) on the\nleft-hand side. One can then derive the expansions of two\nsolutions, labelled zS and zF , about their critical dimensions:\nzF = 2 \u2212 (4 \u2212 d)/4 + O((4 \u2212 d)2 )\nzS = 2 \u2212 (2 \u2212 d)/3 + O((2 \u2212 d)2 ).\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\n\f3\nThe arguments of Ref. [11] can be used to show that\nthese expansions are very robust and more general than\nthe particular ansatz of Eqs. (6) and (7). Similarly, as\nI(B, 0, z) is finite for d \u2192 0 and z > 1, Eq. (8) imposes\nB \u22121 \u223c d. The expansions of the two solutions about\nd = 0 can also be worked out: zF = 4/3 + d/3 + O(d2 )\nand zS = 1 + d/4 + O(d2 ).\nWe emphasize that all these features do not depend\non the choice of B. Any ansatz would lead to the same\nqualitative picture as Fig. 1 provided B \u223c (d(2 \u2212 z))\u22121 .\nThe specific one used here further exploits the uniqueness\nof the solution in d = 1 which imposes additional constraints on B [26]. With this choice, we have solved Eq.\n(10) numerically in 0 < d < 4 and found that there exists\ntwo branches of solutions zS (d) and zF (d) lying in the interval d \u2208 (0, 2) but only one solution, the continuation\nof zF , in the interval d \u2208 (2, 4).\n\n2\n1.8\n\nz\n\n1.6\n1.4\nznum+exact\nzS\nzF\n\n1.2\n1\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4\nd\nFIG. 1: The two solutions zS (d) and zF (d) of the MC equations found in this work, compared with numerical [18] results\nfor d = 2, 3, 4 and the exact results in d = 0, 1, all represented\nby squares.\n\nThe branch zF , referred to as the F solution as it exists\nover the full dimensionality range d \u2208 (0, 4), is similar to\nthe solution analyzed in [11] [27]. It lies fairly close to\ntypical numerical results [18] with z = 1.632 for d = 2\nand z = 1.787 for d = 3, reproduces the exact results in\nd = 0 and d = 1 (see Fig. 1) and reaches z = 2 at dc = 4,\nwhich defines the upper critical dimension of this solution. The other branch, denoted S as it is associated with\nthe shorter dimensionality interval d \u2208 (0, 2), embodies\na new universality class with zS 6= zF for d 6= 1. For this\nsolution, z = 2 at dc = 2 and it does not exist for d \u2265 2,\nso that there remains a single strong-coupling solution in\nand above two dimensions \u2013 the F solution. We emphasise that both the F and S solutions are non-perturbative\nsince no (stable) perturbative fixed point can be found\nfor d < 2 within the standard perturbative expansion in\nthe coupling constant g = 2\u03bb2 D/\u03bd 3 , even to all orders\n[23]. MC theory involves resumming an infinite set of\ndiagrams and so is capable of going beyond standard RG\n\ntechniques.\nWe now comment on our findings. According to MC\ntheory, for d < 2 there are two possible strong-coupling\nuniversality classes, F and S. It is clear that for a given set\nof initial conditions and bare correlators, the time evolution would unambiguously steer the system towards one\nor other of the two solutions. Equivalently, in the mapping to the DPRM, the solution with lowest free energy\nwould be selected as the physical one. The apparent freedom to choose a solution arises because we have considered the scaling regime in which the bare correlators have\nbeen dropped as irrelevant, so we have lost track of their\nrole. However, a clue as to the form of bare correlator\nneeded for the S solution to emerge can be obtained by inspecting the zero-dimensional case. In d = 0, the DPRM\nanalogue is a directed walk along a chain of length L on\nwhich the site energies are random. A dynamical exponent z = 1 would correspond to free energy fluctuations\n\u221a\nof order L2/z\u22121 = L which is larger than the L (for\nz = 4/3) expected for independent random site energies.\nwith z = 1 could only exist with long-range correlations\nbetween the site energies and is therefore not the natural solution for the short-range problem in d = 0. We\nsuspect that the zS branch in the whole range 0 < d < 2\nwould only be realized if there were some long-range correlations in the noise for the KPZ problem or between\nthe site energies for the DPRM analogue.\nTo investigate this possibility further, suppose instead\nof starting out with noise with short-range correlations,\none introduces some long-ranged correlated noise, of the\nform h\u03b7(x, t)\u03b7(x\u2032 , t\u2032 )i = 2R(x \u2212 x\u2032 )\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) with some\npower law distribution R(x) \u221d x2\u03c1\u2212d , or equivalently in\nFourier space R(k) = D(1 + wk \u22122\u03c1 ). The MC equations would formally be the same with D replaced by\nthe 'generalized' noise correlator R(k) [21]. These longrange bare noise correlations will not affect the scaling behavior of the system as long as they decay sufficiently quickly, so that they become irrelevant after\nsome transient regime. The condition for this to happen can be worked out by substituting the scaling forms\nfor G and C into Eq. (3). The initial correlations decay as C0 (k, \u03c9) = 2R(k)|G(k, \u03c9)|2 \u223c k \u22122(z+\u03c1) whereas\nthe long-time correlation function is expected to behave\nas C(k, \u03c9) \u223c k \u2212(2\u03c7+d+z) \u2261 k \u2212(d+4\u2212z) using the identity\nz + \u03c7 = 2. Comparing these two expressions, one infers\nthat the long-range correlations will destabilize a shortrange solution with dynamical exponent z when\n\u03c1>\n\nd + 4 \u2212 3z\n,\n2\n\n(13)\n\nwhich is identical to the criterion obtained in [24] from\nRG arguments. The condition of Eq. (13) determines\nthe phase boundary \u03c1(d, z) between the short-range and\nlong-range stability domains for each of the two MC solutions zF and zS . In the long-range noise dominated\n[24]. The solutions F and S are staregion zLR = d+4\u22122\u03c1\n3\n\n\f4\nble against noise of range \u03c1 if their associated z satisfies\nz < zLR . For all 0 < d < 2, we believe that the S solution\nrequires for its existence the addition of long-range noise\nS\n, as in the\nof infinitesimal amplitude with \u03c1S = d+4\u22123z\n2\ncase d = 0 (where z = 1 would correspond to long-range\nnoise with \u03c1 = 0.5\u2212 ). For 0 < d < 1, the S solution\nlies at the stability limit of the long-range solution and\nin the interval 1 < d < 2, it will be the solution to the\nKPZ problem in the presence of infinitesimal amounts of\nsuch correlated noise if (say) the associated free energy in\nthe DPRM analogue is lower than that of the F solution\n(with the same correlated noise). This S solution could\nhence possibly be brought out by tuning the parameters.\nWe believe that in the absence of some long-range correlation, the F solution will be the appropriate solution or\nuniversality class for 0 < d < 4.\nOur S solution might appear to be of academic interest as it only exists when d < 2 and coincides with the\nF one in d = 1. However, it turns out to be strikingly\nsimilar to the solution found in several theoretical studies. We focus on three of them: the replica symmetry\nbreaking (RSB) calculation of M\u00e9zard and Parisi [14], a\nGaussian variational calculation [15] and Flory-Imry-Ma\n(FIM) arguments [16]. All three approaches result in a\nstrong-coupling solution with dc = 2. The RSB treatment yields a dynamical exponent equivalent to the FIM\nresult [14]: zFIM = (4+d)/3 \u2243 2\u2212(2\u2212d)/3+O((2\u2212d)2),\nwhich is identical to (12) and suggests that the MC solution S and the RSB \u2013 FIM solution are indeed different approximations to the same underlying universality\nclass. It is not apparent how the long-range correlations\nneeded for the S solution to exist enter these analytical\napproaches. However, it has been observed long ago that\nby the addition of a type of long-range force, the Flory\nformula in the conventional self-avoiding polymer problem becomes exact [25].\nTo summarize, we have found a new MC solution, S,\nwhich has an upper critical dimension dc = 2, in addition\nto the usual one, F, which has dc = 4. This new solution\nseems similar to that found by analytical treatments such\nas RSB and FIM arguments, but we believe will only\nexist in the presence of appropriate long-range correlated\nnoise. We acknowledge that the numerical value for z\nshown in Fig. 1 when d = 4 is not apparently consistent\nwith the upper critical dimension dc = 4 of the F solution,\nbut we attribute that to the inability of numerical studies\nin high dimensions to access the scaling regime.\nThe authors wish to thank A.
