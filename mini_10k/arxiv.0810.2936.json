Numerous processes relevant\nfor quantum computation, quantum cryptography [2]\nor quantum teleportation [3] rely on entangled qubit\nstates. Recently, Yu and Eberly [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] found that\nreservoir-induced decay of single-qubit coherence can be\nslower than the corresponding decay of qubit entanglement. Both, abrupt and asymptotically gradual disappearance of entanglement were predicted in amplitude [5]\nand phase damping channels [6]. Abrupt disappearance\nof entanglement in finite time was termed \"entanglement\nsudden death\" (ESD). Also recently, experimental evidence of ESD was reported for an optical setup [9] and\natomic ensembles [10]. Whereas first investigations on\nESD concentrated on entangled two-qubit states, later it\nwas also explored in a wider context and in higher dimensional Hilbert spaces [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19].\nClearly, ESD is a serious limiting factor for the use\nof entangled qubits in quantum information processing.\nIt would seem important to stabilize quantum systems\nagainst this unwanted phenomenon. First studies in this\ncontext concentrated on changing initial states to more\nrobust ones of the same degree of entanglement [20, 21].\nRecently, we have addressed the practically relevant question whether it is possible to delay or even avert ESD by\napplication of particularly chosen local unitary transformations for a given initial state and a given open-system\ndynamics [22]. We demonstrated that this is indeed possible for the special two-qubit system investigated first\nby Yu and Eberly [5] and have found similar effects in\nqubit-qutrit systems [23].\nIn this paper, we generalize our previous results and\ninvestigate ESD of two qubits which are interacting with\nstatistically independent (bosonic) reservoirs at finite\ntemperatures. It is demonstrated that based on the\nPeres-Horodecki criterion [24, 25] and on recent results\nof Huang and Zhu [26] it is possible to develop systematically a simple criterion capable of characterizing delay\nand avoidance of ESD of initially prepared two-qubit Xstates in this open quantum system. With the help of\n\nthis criterion it is proved that, in agreement with recent\nconjectures based on numerical case studies [14], all initially prepared two-qubit X-states exhibit ESD if at least\none of the statistically independent reservoirs is at finite\ntemperature. However, if both reservoirs are at zero temperature, there are always some X-states for which ESD\ndoes not occur. Based on this criterion, we demonstrate\nthat even at finite temperatures of the reservoirs it is possible to hasten or to delay ESD. The characteristic time\nof ESD can be controlled by the time when appropriate\nlocal unitary operations are applied. However, unlike in\nthe zero-temperature case, when at least one of the reservoirs is at finite temperature it is not possible to avoid\nESD completely by any choice of local unitary transformations.\n\nII. OPEN-SYSTEM DYNAMICS OF TWO\nQUBITS COUPLED TO STATISTICALLY\nINDEPENDENT THERMAL RESERVOIRS\n\nIn this section, we briefly summarize the basic equations of motion governing our open quantum system of\ninterest. In order to put the problem of ESD, its delay,\nand avoidance into perspective, let us consider two noninteracting qubits which are spatially well separated so\nthat each of them interacts with its own thermal reservoir. These two reservoirs are assumed to be statistically\nindependent and are possibly also at different temperatures. The coupling of these two qubits to the reservoirs\ncan originate physically from the coupling of two twolevel atoms to the (resonant) modes of the electromagnetic radiation field, for example, with the local radiation\nfield at thermal equilibrium.\nIn the interaction picture and in the dipole- and rotating wave approximation, the resulting equation of motion of these two qubits is given by the master equation\n\n\f2\nIII.

The spontaneous emission of atom i from its excited state |1i i to its\nground state |0i i is described by the spontaneous decay\ni\nrate \u03b3i and \u03c3\u00b1\nare the corresponding raising (+) and lowi\ni\nering (-) operators, i.e. \u03c3+\n= |1i ih0i | and \u03c3\u2212\n= |0i ih1i |.\nThe orthonormal atomic eigenstates |1i = |1iA \u2297 |1iB ,\n|2i = |1iA \u2297 |0iB , |3i = |0iA \u2297 |1iB , |4i = |0iA \u2297 |0iB\nform the (computational) basis of the four dimensional\nHilbert space of the two qubits. The derivation of Eq.(1)\nalso assumes the validity of the Born-Markov approximation. The general solution valid for an arbitrary initially prepared two-qubit state is given in Appendix A\nby Eq.(A1).\nThere is some numerical evidence [14] that the presence of non-zero mean thermal photon numbers in Eq.(1)\nmay be responsible for ESD. However, systematic exploration of these phenomena which is capable of proving the\nsufficiency of non-zero photon numbers for ESD and of\nproviding a systematic analytical understanding of ESD\nin zero-temperature reservoirs has been missing so far.\nOur main purpose is to close this gap. In particular, we\nshall develop a simple analytical criterion for ESD which\nallows a systematic understanding of ESD and its delay\nand avoidance for initially prepared entangled X-states.\n\nIn this section, we analyze conditions under which initially prepared entangled two-qubit states evolving according to Eq.(1) exhibit ESD. Starting from the general time dependent solution of these equations ESD is\nanalyzed with the help of the Peres-Horodecki criterion\n[24, 25] and with the help of all principal minors of the\npartially transposed time-dependent two-qubit quantum\nstate.\nTo check for separability of a quantum state, Peres [24]\nand Horodeckis [25] developed a powerful necessary and\nsufficient condition valid for 2 \u2297 2- and 2 \u2297 3-systems. It\nstates that in these systems a quantum state is separable\nif and only if its partially transposed density operator is\nalso a valid quantum state. Based on this observation, a\nmeasure of entanglement, called negativity, was proposed\n[28]. It is the sum of the absolute values of all the negative\neigenvalues of the partially transposed density operator.\nFor 2 \u2297 2 systems, there can be at most one such negative\neigenvalue [29].\nRecently, Huang and Zhu [26] studied the PeresHorodecki criterion by focussing on the principal minors of the partially transposed density matrix. The\nprincipal minor [\u03c1P T (ijkl...)] of the partially transposed\ndensity operator \u03c1P T is the determinant of the submatrix M(ijkl...) formed by the matrix elements of the\ni, j, k, l, ... rows and columns of the partial transpose \u03c1P T ,\nthat is,\nT\n\u03c1P\nii ,\nP\nT\n\uf8ec \u03c1ji ,\n\uf8ec PT\nM(ijkl...) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec \u03c1ki ,\n\uf8ed \u03c1P T ,\nli\n***\n\n\uf8eb\n\nT\n\u03c1P\nij ,\nPT\n\u03c1jj ,\nT\n\u03c1P\nkj ,\nPT\n\u03c1lj ,\n***\n\nT\n\u03c1P\nik ,\nPT\n\u03c1jk ,\nT\n\u03c1P\nkk ,\nPT\n\u03c1lk ,\n***\n\nT\n\u03c1P\nil ,\nPT\n\u03c1jl ,\nT\n\u03c1P\njl ,\nPT\n\u03c1ll ,\n***\n\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 . (2)\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nIn general, if a matrix is positive semidefinite, then\nall its principal minors are non-negative, and vice versa\n[30]. Therefore, for an entangled two-qubit state \u03c1, the\nsmallest principal minor of its partially transposed density operator must be negative. For two-qubit states the\nnon-negativity of the principal minors [\u03c1P T (1)], [\u03c1P T (2)],\n[\u03c1P T (3)], [\u03c1P T (4)], [\u03c1P T (12)], [\u03c1P T (13)], [\u03c1P T (24)], and\n[\u03c1P T (34)] is guaranteed already by the non-negativity of\nthe original density matrix \u03c1. As a consequence, a general\ntwo-qubit state is entangled if and only if the minimum\nvalue of the remaining seven principal minors P (\u03c1P T ) is\nnegative, that is,\n\nP (\u03c1P T ) \u2261 min{ [\u03c1P T (14)], [\u03c1P T (23)], [\u03c1P T (123)], [\u03c1P T (124)], [\u03c1P T (134)], [\u03c1P T (234)], [\u03c1P T (1234)] } < 0.\n\n(3)\n\n\f3\nTypically, the investigation of these seven principal minors for general solutions \u03c1(t) of the density operator\nequation (1) is cumbersome. However, significant simplifications are possible for identical zero-temperature reservoirs with m = n = 0, and \u03b31 = \u03b32 = \u03b3 in Eq.(1). Thus,\nHuang and Zhu [26] could demonstrate that for asymp\u2212\ntotically long times t\u2212\n\u221e with \u03b3t\u221e \u226b 1, the separability of\n\u2212\n\u03c1(t\u221e ) is determined by the initial state \u03c1. In particular,\nthese authors showed that the matrix\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03c111\n\u03c121\n\u03c113\n\u03c123\n\u03c114\n\u03c113 + \u03c124 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u03c1 \u03c1 + \u03c122\n\u03c1\u0303 = \uf8ed 12 11\n,\n(4)\n\u03c131\n\u03c141\n\u03c111 + \u03c133 \u03c121 + \u03c143 \uf8f8\n\u03c132 \u03c131 + \u03c142 \u03c112 + \u03c134\n1\nwhich is defined in terms of the matrix elements of the\ninitially prepared two-qubit quantum state \u03c1, determines\nthe asymptotic separability of the two qubits and thus\nthe presence or absence of ESD.\nIf P (\u03c1\u0303) < 0, the two-qubit state \u03c1(t\u2212\n\u221e ) is entangled and\nESD does not occur. If P (\u03c1\u0303) > 0, the asymptotic quantum state \u03c1(t\u2212\n\u221e ) is separable and ESD takes place. In\nsummary, Huang and Zhu [26] showed that for identical\nzero-temperature reservoirs the necessary and sufficient\ncondition for ESD is given by\nP (\u03c1\u0303) > 0,\n\n(5)\n\nand is determined by the initially prepared two-qubit\nquantum state.\nFor initially prepared X-states, that is, quantum states\nwith \u03c112 = \u03c113 = \u03c124 = \u03c134 = 0 in the basis of Sec.II, this\ncondition can be simplified considerably. In Appendix B,\nall relevant seven principal minors of a given quantum\nstate \u03c1\u0303 are evaluated. From these expressions it is apparent that for initially prepared X-states, all the seven\nrelevant principal minors of \u03c1\u0303 of Eq.(4) are positive if and\nonly if the two principal minors are positive, that is,\n[\u03c1\u0303(14)] , [\u03c1\u0303(23)] > 0.\n\n(6)\n\nThus, in the case of identical zero-temperature reservoirs\nand for initially prepared X-states, only these two principal minors determine whether the time evolution of\nEq.(1) causes ESD or not.\nEven more general properties can be deduced from the\nexplicit expressions for the principal minors of X-states as\ngiven in Appendix B. It is apparent from the general solution of the density operator Eq.(1) as given in Appendix\nA that an initially prepared two-qubit X-state remains\nan X-state for all times. Combining this observation with\nthe results of Appendix B leads to the general conclusion\nthat initially prepared two-qubit X-states exhibit ESD if\nand only if at asymptotic times t\u2212\n\u221e the principal minors\nare both positive, i.e.\n\u2212\n[\u03c1(14)](t\u2212\n\u221e ) , [\u03c1(23)](t\u221e ) > 0.\n\n(7)\n\nThis general result holds even if the two qubits interact\nwith statistically independent reservoirs at finite temperatures so that their dynamics are described by Eq.(1).\n\nIV.\n\nTWO-QUBIT X-STATES AND QUANTUM\nCONTROL OF ESD\n\nIn this section, we specialize our discussion of ESD\nto initially prepared arbitrary two-qubit X-states. Delay and avoidance of ESD of initially prepared twoqubit X-states coupled to statistically independent zerotemperature reservoirs is discussed in subsection A. In\nsubsection B these results are generalized to reservoirs at\nfinite temperatures. In particular, it is proved that if at\nleast one of the reservoirs has nonzero temperature, all\ninitially prepared X-states exhibit ESD.\nLet us first of all briefly summarize some basic properties of X-states. The density matrix of a two-qubit\nX-state is of the general form\n\n\u03c1X\n\n\uf8f6\n\u03c111 0 0 \u03c114\n\uf8ec 0 \u03c122 \u03c123 0 \uf8f7\n.\n=\uf8ed\n0 \u03c132 \u03c133 0 \uf8f8\n\u03c141 0 0 \u03c144\n\uf8eb\n\n(8)\n\ni.e. \u03c112 = \u03c113 = \u03c124 = \u03c134 = 0. In particular,\nWerner states [31] are special cases of such X-states\nand some aspects of their ESD have already been discussed [7, 21, 32, 33]. Eq. (8) describes a quantum\nstate\nP4 provided the unit trace2 and positivity conditions\n2\ni=1 \u03c1ii = 1, \u03c122 \u03c133 \u2265 |\u03c123 | , and \u03c111 \u03c144 \u2265 |\u03c114 | are\nfulfilled. X-states are entangled if and only if either\n\u03c122 \u03c133 < |\u03c114 |2 or \u03c111 \u03c144 < |\u03c123 |2 . Both conditions cannot hold simultaneously [29].\n\nA.\n\nDelaying and avoiding ESD in statistically\nindependent zero-temperature reservoirs\n\nAs discussed in the previous section, for zerotemperature reservoirs the criterion for ESD is given by\nEq.(6) which together with the results of Appendix B\nyields the necessary and sufficient conditions for ESD:\n[\u03c1\u0303(14)] =\n\n\u03c111 \u2212 |\u03c123 |2 > 0,\n[\u03c1\u0303(23)] = (\u03c111 + \u03c122 )(\u03c111 + \u03c133 ) \u2212 |\u03c114 |2 > 0.\n(9)\n\nDepending on the degree of entanglement of the initially\nprepared two-qubit state, two different cases can be distinguished.\nCase 1: For initially prepared entangled two-qubit\nstates fulfilling the condition,\n\u03c111 \u03c144 < |\u03c123 |2 ,\n\n(10)\n\nthe analytical expression for the negativity of the quantum state \u03c1(t) satisfying Eq.(1) for \u03b31 = \u03b32 = \u03b3 and\nm = n = 0 is given by\n\n\f4\n\nN1 (\u03c1X (t)) = max [ 0,\n\nq\nF (p, \u03c1ii )2 \u2212 4p2 (\u03c111 F (p, \u03c1ii ) \u2212 p2 \u03c1211 \u2212 |\u03c123 |2 ) \u2212 F (p, \u03c1ii ) ],\n\nwith F (p, \u03c1ii ) = (1 \u2212 2p + 2p2 )\u03c111 + (1 \u2212 p)(\u03c122 + \u03c133 ) +\n\u03c144 , p = exp(\u2212\u03b3t). For any initially entangled two-qubit\nstate \u03c1, Eq.(10) implies \u03c122 \u03c133 \u2265 |\u03c114 |2 so that one of\nthe conditions of Eq. (9) is satisfied. Thus, provided also\nthe other condition, namely \u03c111 > |\u03c123 |2 , is satisfied, an\ninitially prepared entangled two-qubit state exhibits ESD\nand its negativity becomes zero at a finite time, say t1 .\nProvided both conditions of Eq. (9) are fulfilled, ESD\ncan be delayed or even avoided by local unitary operations acting on the two qubits involved. In particular,\nlet us concentrate on local unitary operations which exchange the density matrix elements \u03c111 (t) and \u03c144 (t) of\nthe quantum state at a time t < t1 in such a way that\ntheir product, i.e. \u03c111 (t + 0)\u03c144 (t + 0), remains constant\nbut that the condition \u03c144 (t + 0) > |\u03c123 (t + 0)|2 is violated. According to Eq.(9), in such a case ESD will be\navoided. \u03c144 (t) is the probability of finding both qubits\nin their ground states. Thus, as a consequence of the\ndynamics of Eq.(1), the density matrix element \u03c144 (t)\nincreases monotonically. There will be a limiting time\ntsw for any possible switching of these matrix elements\nfor which ESD can still be avoided. If the local operation\nis applied after this limiting time, ESD may possibly be\ndelayed but it is unavoidable.\nThis simple consequence of the criterion of Eq.(9) explains recent numerical work on this problem [22]. In\nfact, operations of this type can avoid ESD for any initially prepared two-qubit X-state provided they are applied at a time t < tsw . In particular, this applies to the\nsubset of Werner states with \u03c114 = 0 which are mixtures\nof a singlet state with probability a and a completely unpolarized (chaotic) state. These Werner states \u221a\nexhibit\nESD in the parameter range a \u2208 [1/3, (\u22121 + 5)/2)\n[20] where \u03c111 (t) > |\u03c123 (t)|2 while entanglement decays asymptotically\nfor values of a in the range a \u2208\n\u221a\n((\u22121 + 5)/2, 1] which corresponds to \u03c111 (t) < |\u03c123 (t)|2 .\nLet us now deal with the question of which unitary\ntransformations can achieve such a switch between \u03c144 (t)\nand \u03c111 (t). The most general 2 \u00d7 2 unitary matrix acting\non a qubit is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\ncos(\u03b8)ei\u03b1 \u2212 sin(\u03b8)ei(\u03b1\u2212\u03c9)\n,\n(12)\nU (2) =\nsin(\u03b8)ei(\u03b2+\u03c9)\ncos(\u03b8)ei\u03b2\nwhich is a linear superposition of the Pauli matrices \u03c3x ,\n\u03c3y , \u03c3z , and the Identity matrix \u03c30 . Exchanging the matrix elements \u03c111 and \u03c144 can be achieved by applying two\nappropriately chosen unitaries UA and UB of the form of\nEq.(12) on qubits A and B at a suitably chosen time, say\nt, so that the X-state \u03c1X (t) is transformed into another\nX-state (UA \u2297 UB )\u03c1X (t)(UA\u2020 \u2297 UB\u2020 ), for example.\nThe most general local unitary operations transforming an arbitrary X-state into another one fulfill the con-\n\n(11)\n\nditions\nsin(2\u03b8A ) = sin(2\u03b8B ) = 0 \u2212\u2192\n\u03b8A = rA \u03c0/2, \u03b8B = rB \u03c0/2,\n\n(13)\n\nwith rA , rB \u2208 Z. X-state preserving local unitary transformations with even values of rA and rB do not have any\nsignificant effect on the density matrix elements except\nmultiplying \u03c114 (t) by a constant phase factor. Odd values of rA and rB serve the purpose of exchanging \u03c111 (t)\nand \u03c144 (t). For any odd value of rA = rB , for example,\nthe corresponding unitary two-qubit operator is given by\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0\n0\n0\ne2i(\u03b1\u2212\u03c9)\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n0\n0\n\u2212ei(\u03b1+\u03b2)\n0\n\uf8f7 . (14)\nU =\uf8ec\ni(\u03b1+\u03b2)\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n0\n\u2212e\n0\n0\n2i(\u03b2+\u03c9)\ne\n0\n0\n0\nA case in which such a X-state-preserving local unitary\ntransformation is applied only onto qubit B can be described by parameters \u03b8A = \u03b1A = \u03b2A = \u03c9A = 0, for example. They lead to the transformations \u03c111 (t) \u21d4 \u03c122 (t),\n\u03c133 (t) \u21d4 \u03c144 (t), and \u03c114 (t) \u21d4 \u03c123 (t). In view of the characteristic time evolution of \u03c122 (t) in zero-temperature\nreservoirs (compare with Appendix A) and the criterion\nof Eq.(9) this implies that such a switch of matrix elements may delay ESD but it cannot be avoided.\nCase 2: For initially prepared entangled two-qubit Xstates satisfying the alternative condition\n\u03c122 \u03c133 < |\u03c114 |2 ,\n\n(15)\n\nthe analytical expression for the negativity of the resulting quantum state \u03c1X (t) is given by\np\nN2 (\u03c1X (t)) = max [ 0, p ( (\u03c122 \u2212 \u03c133 )2 + 4|\u03c114 |2\n\u2212(\u03c122 + \u03c133 ) \u2212 (2 \u2212 2 p) \u03c111 ) ].\n(16)\nEq. (15) implies \u03c111 \u03c144 \u2265 |\u03c123 |2 . Thus, the first condition\nof Eq. (9) is always satisfied so that ESD occurs whenever\nalso the second condition is satisfied. The simplest case\narises for \u03c123 = 0 where the initially prepared state is\na Werner state, i.e. an incoherent mixture of a triplet\nstate with probability a and the completely unpolarized\nstate. ESD takes place in the parameter regime a \u2208\n[1/3, 1) where both conditions are satisfied during the\ntime evolution. In the case of an initially prepared Bell\nstate, i.e. for a = 1, the second condition of Eq. (9) fails\nand entanglement decays asymptotically.\nAs discussed above, the first condition of Eq. (9) is always fulfilled in the cases considered here so that ESD\ntakes place always except in the particular case of an\ninitially prepared Bell state which fulfills the condition\n\n\f5\n(\u03c111 (t) + \u03c122 (t))(\u03c111 (t) + \u03c133 (t)) = |\u03c114 (t)|2 . As a consequence any switch capable of exchanging \u03c123 (t) and\n\u03c114 (t) will be sufficient to avoid or delay ESD. Such a\nswitch can be implemented by a local unitary X-statepreserving transformation acting on qubit A or B only.\nAs a result the second condition of Eq. (9) remains always\ntrue, while the validity of the first condition depends on\nthe choice of the switching time t. If \u03c133 (t) > |\u03c114 (t)|2\nESD is unavoidable. However, for all switching times violating this condition ESD is averted completely. As an\nexample, let us consider Werner states\u221awith \u03c123 (0) = 0.\nIn the parameter range a \u2208 [1/3, (\u22121 + 5)/2) the condition \u03c133 (t) > |\u03c114 (t)|2 is fulfilled for all times so that\n\u221a ESD\ntakes place. In the parameter regime a \u2208 ((\u22121+ 5)/2, 1]\nthis condition is violated so that entanglement decays\nasymptotically.\n\n\u221a\nwith |\u03a8i = (|0, 1i \u00b1 |1, 0i)/ 2. It is known that this entangled state, while interacting with a vacuum reservoir,\nlooses its entanglement at \u03b3t \u2248 0.5348 [22]. However,\nwhile interacting with reservoirs at finite temperatures,\nthe time of sudden death for this initial state depends\non the values of m and n. The solution of Eq. (1) for\nthe input state of Eq. (18) can be obtained easily using the general solution given by Eq. (A1). After taking\nthe partial transpose of the resulting density operator\nit is possible to obtain an analytical expression for the\nnegativity of the quantum state at any time t. Setting\nm = n = 0.1, for example, we observe that ESD occurs at time tESD \u2248 0.4115/\u03b3. Depending on the time\nwhen local unitary transformations are applied to qubits\nA and B, ESD can be speeded up or delayed for some\nfinite time.\n\n1\nB.\n\nControlling ESD in statistically independent\nfinite-temperature reservoirs\n\nAccording to Eq.(6), ESD takes place if and only if the\ntwo principal minors\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\u0393tend\n0.4\n\n[\u03c1P T (14)] = m2 (m + 1)2 + e\u2212(2m+1)\u03b3t [F (1) ]\n\n0.2\n\n+e\u22122(2m+1)\u03b3t [F (2) ] + e\u22123(2m+1)\u03b3t [F (3) ]\n\n\u0393tB\n\n+e\u22124(2m+1)\u03b3t[F (4) ],\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n\u0393tA\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n\u0393tsw\n[\u03c1P T (23)] = m2 (m + 1)2 + e\u2212(2m+1)\u03b3t [G(1) ]\n+e\u22122(2m+1)\u03b3t [G(2) ] + e\u22123(2m+1)\u03b3t [G(3) ]\n+e\u22124(2m+1)\u03b3t [G(4) ],\n\n(17)\n\nare positive in the limit of very long interaction times.\nFor simplicity, we have taken m = n and \u03b31 = \u03b32 = \u03b3\nin Eq.(17). The quantities F (i) and G(i) are functions\nof m and of the initial matrix elements of the initially\nprepared quantum state. Their explicit forms are given\nin Appendix C. Furthermore, the general expressions for\n[\u03c1P T (14)] and [\u03c1P T (23)] are provided in Appendix B.\nFor sufficiently long times, say t \u2265 t\u2212\n\u221e and for m > 0,\n\u2212\nfactors of the form e\u2212(2m+1)\u03b3t\u221e are exponentially small\nand therefore both [\u03c1P T (14)] and [\u03c1P T (23)] are positive.\nAnalogously, one can show that for unequal values of the\nmean photon numbers m and n, both minors are positive\nif and only if at least one of these mean photon numbers\nis not equal to zero. Hence, we arrive at the central result that if one of the (photon) reservoirs is at nonzero\ntemperature all initially prepared X-states exhibit ESD.\nAs ESD is unavoidable in these cases, it may be useful at least to delay it. Indeed this can be achieved for\nall possible X-states [5, 22]. For the sake of demonstration let us consider the particular example of an initially\nprepared entangled state of the form\n\u03c1=\n\n1\n(|1, 1ih1, 1| + 2|\u03a8ih\u03a8|)\n3\n\n(18)\n\nFIG. 2: Dependence of the time tend of ESD on the switching\ntime tsw for m = n = 0.1: The X-state-preserving local unitary transformations switch the density matrix elements \u03c111\nand \u03c144 in Eq.

However, typically\nsuch a delay is possible only for a certain range of switching times tsw , such as tsw < tB = 0.279/\u03b3 in Fig.(2).\nEventually ESD is unavoidable. In the case considered\nin Fig.(2), it takes place at tend \u2248 0.9817/\u03b3.\nIn Fig.(3) the relation between tend and tsw is depicted\nfor mean thermal photon numbers m = n = 0.01. In this\ncase ESD occurs at tESD \u2248 0.5172/\u03b3. If the switch is\napplied before tA \u2248 0.5172/\u03b3, ESD is hastened. Any\nswitch made before tB \u2248 0.2877/\u03b3 delays ESD up to the\nmaximum possible time tend \u2248 2.7087/\u03b3. This larger\ndelay in comparison with the case considered in Fig.(2)\nis due to smaller values of the mean photon numbers.\nTwo recent papers that have appeared since completion of our work examine related topics.

Based on this criterion, we have presented an\nanalytical description of ESD of X-states and its delaying\nor its avoidance by local unitary actions. We have proved\nthat if at least one of the reservoirs is at finite temperature, all X-states exhibit ESD. Thus, in these cases ESD\ncan only be delayed but not averted.
