CHIPCHAKOV\nAbstract. Let E be a field satisfying the following conditions: (i)\nthe p-component of the Brauer group Br(E) is nontrivial whenever p\nis a prime number for which E is properly included in its maximal pextension; (ii) the relative Brauer group Br(L/E) equals the maximal\nsubgroup of Br(E) of exponent p, for every cyclic extension L/E of degree p. The paper proves that finite abelian extensions of E are uniquely\ndetermined by their norm groups and related essentially as in the classical local class field theory. This includes analogues to the fundamental\ncorrespondence, the local reciprocity law and the local Hasse symbol.\n\n1. Introduction and statements of the main results\nThis paper is concerned with finite abelian extensions of primarily quasilocal (abbr, PQL) fields, and can be viewed as a continuation of [9], I. When\nE is a strictly PQL-field, it shows that these extensions and their norm\ngroups are related as in the fundamental correspondence of the classical local class field theory (see [20], page 101). The paper proves that they are\nsubject to an exact analogue to the local reciprocity law (formulated, e.g.,\nin [45], Ch. 6, Theorem 8, and [20], Theorem 7.1), and to a partial analogue to the local Hasse symbol (as characterized in [25], Ch. 2, see also\n[55], and [20], Theorems 6.9 and 6.10) of form determined by invariants of\nthe Brauer group Br(E). It takes a step towards characterizing the fields\nwhose finite abelian extensions have the above properties. When E belongs\nto some special classes of traditional interest, the present research enables\none to achieve this aim and to find a fairly complete description of the norm\ngroups of arbitrary finite separable extensions of E (see Section 3, [8, 12]\nand the references in [13], Remark 3.9).\nThe basic notation, terminology and conventions kept in this paper are\nstandard and virtually the same as in [9], I, and [13]. Throughout, P denotes\nthe set of prime numbers and every algebra A is understood to be associative\nwith a unit lying in the considered subalgebras of A. Simple algebras are\nsupposed to be finite-dimensional over their centres, Brauer and value groups\nare written additively, Galois groups are viewed as profinite with respect to\nthe Krull topology, and the considered profinite group homomorphisms are\ncontinuous. For each field E, E \u2217 denotes its multiplicative group, Esep a\nseparable closure of E, GE = G(Esep /E) is the absolute Galois group of\nKey words and phrases.

As usual, E is said to be formally real, if \u22121\nis not presentable over E as a finite sum of squares; E is called nonreal,\notherwise. We say that E is Pythagorean, if it is formally real and the set\nE \u22172 = {\u03bb2 : \u03bb \u2208 E \u2217 } is additively closed. For any field extension F/E,\n\u03c1E/F denotes the scalar extension map of Br(E) into Br(F ), Br(F/E) the\nrelative Brauer group of F/E, and I(F/E) is the set of intermediate fields of\nF/E. When F/E is finite and separable, CorF/E stands for the corestriction\nmap of Br(F ) into Br(E) (see [50]). We say that E is p-quasilocal, for some\np \u2208 P, if it satisfies one of the following conditions: (i) every cyclic degree p\nextension of E is embeddable as a subalgebra in each \u2206 \u2208 d(E) of (Schur)\nindex p; (ii) the p-component Br(E)p of Br(E) is trivial or p \u2208\n/ P (E). The\nfield E is called PQL, if it is p-quasilocal for every p \u2208 P; when this holds,\nE is said to be strictly PQL in case Br(E)p 6= {0}, p \u2208 P (E). We say that\nE is quasilocal, if its finite extensions are PQL.\nLocal fields and p-adically closed fields are strictly quasilocal (abbr, SQL),\ni.e. their finite extensions are strictly PQL (cf. [47], Ch. XIII, Sect. 3, [42],\nTheorem 3.1 and Lemma 2.9, and [7], Sect. 3). The strictly PQL-property\nhas been fully characterized in the following two classes: (i) algebraic extensions of global fields [12]; (ii) Henselian discrete valued fields [7], Sect.\n2. These facts extend the arithmetic basis of this research which is further\nmotivated by results of [9], I, on Brauer groups of PQL-fields and on absolute Galois groups of quasilocal fields. For reasons clarified in the sequel,\nour approach to the main topic of this paper is purely algebraic. Our starting point is the fact that residue fields of Henselian valued stable fields are\nPQL in the case of totally indivisible value groups, in the sense of (2.1) (i).\nSpecifically, a Henselian discrete valued field (K, v) with a perfect residue\nb is stable if and only if K\nb is stable and PQL [44], Proposition 2\nfield K\n(cf. also [9], I, and [14], Proposition 2.3). These and other related results\nshow, with their proofs, that PQL-fields partly resemble local fields in a\nnumber of respects (see Propositions 2.2-2.3, [9], I, Lemma 4.3 and [9], II,\nb is p-quasilocal and\nLemma 2.3). For example, by [9], I, Lemma 4.3, if K\ne 1 and L\ne 2 are different extensions of K\nb in K(p)\nb\nL\nof degree p, then the inner\ne\nb\ne\nb\ne i /K),\nb i = 2, is equal to\nproduct N (L1 /K)N (L2 /K) of the norm groups N (L\nb \u2217 . This result and its key role in the proof of [9], I, Theorem 4.1, attract\nK\ninterest in the study of the PQL-property along the lines of the classical\nlocal class field theory, with the notion of a local field extended as follows:\nDefinition 1. Let E be a field, Nr(E) the set of norm groups of E, and\n\u03a9(E) the set of finite abelian extensions of E in Esep . We say that E admits\n1-dimensional local class field theory (abbr, LCFT), if the natural mapping\nof \u03a9(E) into Nr(E) (by the rule M \u2192 N (M/E), M \u2208 \u03a9(E)) is injective\nand the following condition holds, for each M1 , M2 \u2208 \u03a9(E):\n(1.1) The norm group (over E) of the compositum M1 M2 equals the intersection N (M1 /E) \u2229 N (M2 /E), and N (M1 \u2229 M2 /E) = N (M1 /E)N (M2 /E).\n2\n\n\fWe say that E is a field with 1-dimensional local p-class field theory (abbr,\nlocal p-CFT), for a given p \u2208 P, if the fields from the set \u03a9p (E) = {L \u2208\n\u03a9(E) : L \u2286 E(p)} are uniquely determined by their norm groups and satisfy\ncondition (1.1). When this is the case and p \u2208 P (E), we have Br(E)p 6= {0}\n(see Proposition 3.3). Observe that E admits LCFT if and only if it admits\nlocal p-CFT, for every p \u2208 P (E). This follows from Lemma 2.1 and shows\nthat PQL-fields with LCFT are strictly PQL.\nThe main purpose of this paper is to shed light on the place of strictly\nPQL-fields in LCFT by proving the following:\nTheorem 1.1. Strictly PQL-fields admit LCFT. Conversely, a field E admitting such a theory is strictly PQL, if each D \u2208 d(E) of prime exponent\np is similar to a tensor product of cyclic division E-algebras of index p.\nTheorem 1.2. Let E and M be fields, such that E is strictly PQL, P (E) 6=\n\u03c6 and M \u2208 \u03a9(E). For each p \u2208 P (E), let p Br(E) = {bp \u2208 Br(E) : pbp = 0},\nIp be a basis and d(p) the dimension of p Br(E) as a vector space over\nthe field Fp with p elements, G(M/E)p the Sylow p-subgroup of the Gad(p)\nlois group G(M/E), and G(M/E)p\nthe direct product, indexed by Ip , of\nisomorphic copies of G(M/E)p . Then the direct product G(M/E)Br(E) =\nQ\nd(p)\nand the quotient group E \u2217 /N (M/E) are isomorphic.\np\u2208P (E) G(M/E)p\nBefore stating \u221a\nour third main result, recall that a field F is Pythagorean\nwith F (2) = F ( \u22121) if and only if it is formally real and 2-quasilocal\n[9], I, Lemma 3.5. Note also that, by [56], Theorem 2, if p \u2208 P (F ), then\nF (p) contains as a subfield a Zp -extension Up of F (i.e. Up /F is Galois with\nG(Up /F ) isomorphic to the additive group Zp of p-adic integers) unless p = 2\nand F is Pythagorean. We retain notation as in Theorem 1.2.\nTheorem 1.3. Let E be a strictly PQL-field, such that P (E) 6= \u03c6, and let\nE\u221e \u2286 Esep be the compositum of fields Ep , p \u2208 P (E), where Ep /E is a Zp extension, if p > 2 or E is nonreal, and E2 = E(2) when E is formally real.\nThen there exists a set HE = {( , M/E) : E \u2217 \u2192 G(M/E)Br(E) , M \u2208 \u03a9(E)}\nof surjective group homomorphisms with the following properties:\n(i) The kernel of ( , M/E) coincides with N (M/E), for each M \u2208 \u03a9(E);\n(ii) If M \u2208 \u03a9(E) and K is an intermediate field of M/E, then ( , K/E)\nequals the composition \u03c0M/K \u25e6 ( , M/E), where \u03c0M/K : G(M/E)Br(E) \u2192\nG(K/E)Br(E) is the homomorphism mapping the ip -th component of\nd(p)\nd(p)\nG(M/E)p on the ip -th component of G(K/E)p as the natural projection\nG(M/E)p \u2192 G(K/E)p , for each pair (p, ip ) \u2208 P (E) \u00d7 Ip ;\n(iii) The set HE is uniquely determined by the mappings ( , \u0393/E), where\n\u0393 runs through the set of finite extensions of E in E\u221e of primary degrees.\nTheorems 1.1 and 1.2 show the strong influence of Br(E) on a number\nof algebraic properties of a PQL-field E. They are obtained from similar\nresults on finite abelian p-extensions of p-quasilocal fields, stated as Theorem\n3.1. This approach uses several properties of p-quasilocal fields without\n3\n\n\fgenerally valid analogues for PQL-fields (see Propositions 2.2 and 2.3, [9],\nI, Corollary 8.5, and [13], Proposition 6.3). As shown in [13, 14] and [9],\nII, Sect. 3, it enables one to describe the isomorphism classes of Brauer\ngroups of major types of PQL-fields, and of the reduced parts of Brauer\ngroups of equicharacteristic Henselian valued absolutely stable fields with\ntotally indivisible value groups. Thus it turns out that usually powerful\nmethods of valuation theory are virtually inapplicable to many PQL and\nmost presently known quasilocal fields (see (2.4) and (2.5) (iii), and compare\n(2.1) with (2.2) and Remark 2.4). At the same time, the proofs in [13] show\nat crucial points that the study of the PQL-property can effectively rely\non constructive methods based on properties (established in the 1990's, see\ne.g. [17], Proposition 2.6, and [46]) of relative Brauer groups of extensions\nobtained as transfers of function fields of Brauer-Severi and other varieties.\nThis makes it possible to apply Theorem 3.1 and other results about pquasilocal fields to Brauer groups of arbitrary fields, and so leads to a better\nunderstanding of the relations between Galois groups and norm groups of\nfinite Galois extensions of quasilocal fields (see Remark 4.3 and [13]).\nWhen E is a local field, the former assertion of Theorem 1.1 yields the\nfundamental correspondence of the classical local class field theory. If E\nis merely strictly PQL with d(p) = 1, for all p \u2208 P (E) (i.e. with Br(E)\nembeddable in Q/Z, the quotient group of the additive group of rational numbers by the subgroup of integers), then Theorem 1.2 states that\nE \u2217 /N (M/E) \u223c\n= G(M/E). This holds, for instance, in the following cases:\n\n(1.2) (i) E is an algebraic strictly PQL-extension of a global field E0 ; when\nBr(E)p 6= {0}, by [12], Theorem 2.1, p \u2208 P (E) and Br(E)p is isomorphic\nto the quasicyclic p-group Z(p\u221e ) unless p = 2 and E is formally real (big\nfamilies of such E can be constructed by applying [12], Theorem 2.2).\n\u2217 ), \u03a3 being the set of finite\n(ii) The triple AT(E) = (GE , {GF : F \u2208 \u03a3}, Esep\nextensions of E in Esep , is an Artin-Tate class formation (see [3], Ch. 14).\n\nIt is known that (1.2) (ii) holds, if E is p-adically closed or has a Henselian\ndiscrete valuation with a quasifinite residue field. Note further that the\nstatement of Theorem 1.2 coincides in case (1.2) (ii) with the local reciprocity\nlaw of the Artin-Tate abstract class field theory [3], Ch. 14, Sect. 5. As to\nTheorem 1.3, it can be viewed as a partial analogue to the local Hasse symbol\n(compare with Theorem 3.2, Remark 7.1 and [55], Theorem 3). The question\nof whether fields E with LCFT are strictly PQL is open. By Theorem 1.1,\nits answer depends on the solution to one of the leading unsolved problems\nin Brauer group theory (see Remark 3.4, [35], Sect. 16, and [34], Sect.\n5). This allows us to prove in Section 3 that SQL-fields are those whose\nfinite extensions admit LCFT. Note also that when p Br(E) is finite, for each\np \u2208 P (E), the answer is positive if and only if E \u2217 /N (M/E) \u223c\n= G(M/E)Br(E) ,\nM \u2208 \u03a9(E) (apply Theorem 1.2 and [41], Sect. 15.1, Proposition b).\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 includes generalities about\nPQL-fields. The former and the latter assertions of Theorem 1.1 are proved\nin Sections 4 and 3, respectively. Our main results on local p-CFT are stated\nin Section 3. Theorems 1.2, 1.3 and these results are proved in Sections 4,\n6 and 7. Section 5 contains an interpretation of a part of local p-CFT\n4\n\n\fin terms of Galois cohomology. It generalizes [31], Theorem 1, as well as\nknown relations between local fields and Demushkin groups (cf. [48], Ch.\nII, Theorem 4), and the sufficiency part of the main results of [36, 37].\n2. Preliminaries on PQL-fields\nThe present research is based on the possibility to reduce the study of\nnorm groups of finite abelian extensions to the special case of p-extensions.\nThe reduction is obtained by applying the following lemma (which can be\ndeduced from Galois theory (see e.g., [32], Ch. VIII) and [9], II, Lemma 2.2).\nLemma 2.1. Let E be a field, M \u2208 \u03a9(E), M 6= E, \u03a0 the set of prime\ndivisors of [M : E], and Mp = M \u2229 E(p), for each p \u2208 \u03a0. Then M coincides\nwith the compositum of the fields Mp : p \u2208 \u03a0, N (M/E)\nQ = \u2229p\u2208\u03a0 N (Mp /E)\nand E \u2217 /N (M/E) is isomorphic to the direct product p\u2208\u03a0 E \u2217 /N (Mp /E).\nThe main results of [9], I, used in this paper can be stated as follows:\nProposition 2.2. Let E be a p-quasilocal field with Br(E)p 6= {0}, for some\np \u2208 P (E). Suppose further that R is a finite extension of E in E(p) and\nD \u2208 d(E) is an algebra of p-primary dimension. Then:\n(i) R is p-quasilocal and D/E is a cyclic of exponent exp(D) = ind(D);\n(ii) Br(R)p is a divisible group unless \u221ap = 2, R = E and E is formally\nreal; when E is formally real, E(2) = E( \u22121) and Br(E)2 is of order 2;\n(iii) \u03c1E/R maps Br(E)p surjectively on Br(R)p and CorR/E maps Br(R)p\ninjectively in Br(E)p ; every E-automorphism \u03c8 of the field R is extendable\nto a ring automorphism on each DR \u2208 s(R) of p-primary index;\n(iv) R embeds in D as an E-subalgebra if and only if the degree [R : E]\ndivides ind(D); R is a splitting field of D if and only if ind(D) | [R : E].\nOur next result gives an equivalent form of Proposition 2.2 (iv), for\nPQL-fields, and shows its optimality in the class of algebraic strictly PQLextensions of the field Q of rational numbers. We refer the reader to [9], II,\nfor a proof of this result, which demonstrates the applicability of the arithmetic method of constructing such extensions, based on [12], Theorem 2.2.\nProposition 2.3. (i) Let E be a PQL-field, M/E a finite Galois extension\nand R an intermediate field of M/E. If G(M/E) is nilpotent, then R embeds\nas an E-subalgebra in each D \u2208 d(E) of index divisible by [R : E].\n(ii) For each nonnilpotent finite group G, there exists a strictly PQL-field\n\u03a8 = \u03a8(G), such that E/Q is an algebraic extension, Br(\u03a8) \u223c\n= Q/Z and there\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u223c\nis a Galois extension \u03a8 of \u03a8 with G(\u03a8 /\u03a8) = G, which does not embed as\na \u03a8-subalgebra in any \u2206 \u2208 d(\u03a8) of index ind(\u2206) = [\u03a8\u2032 : \u03a8].\nThe main results of [9], I, and [5], Sect. 3, show that Br(E) and GE are the\nmain algebraic structures associated with any quasilocal field E. Therefore,\nwe would like to point out that GE is prosolvable and Br(E) is embeddable\nin Q/Z in the following two cases:\n5\n\n\f(2.1) (i) E is an algebraic extension of a quasilocal field K with a Henselian\nvaluation v, such that v(K) is totally indivisible (i.e. v(K) 6= pv(K), for\n/ P (E) (conevery p \u2208 P); then Br(E) is divisible with Br(E)p\u2032 = {0}, p\u2032 \u2208\ncerning GE and Br(E), see [4], I, Lemma 1.2 and Proposition 3.1, and [14],\nCorollary 5.3 as well as [9], I, (1.3), respectively).\n(ii) E is formally real and quasilocal; then Br(E) is of order 2 and GE has\nan abelian open subgroup of index 2, which is either procyclic or 2-generated\nas a topological group (see [5], Sect. 3, and [13], Proposition 3.4).\nCondition (2.1) (i) holds, for example, when (K, v) is Henselian discrete\nvalued quasilocal or E is an algebraic quasilocal nonreal extension of a global\nfield, such that Br(E) 6= {0} (cf. [12], Sect. 3). The existence of a PQL-field\nF of essentially nonarithmetic nature, i.e. with Br(F ) not embeddable in\nQ/Z, has been established in [46], Sect. 3, by observing that every abelian\ntorsion group A embeds in Br(F (A)), for a suitably chosen strictly PQLfield F (A). This result and Proposition 2.2 (ii) are complemented by the\nfollowing statement which describes, in conjunction with [19], Theorem 23.1,\nthe isomorphism classes of Brauer groups of nonreal PQL-fields (see [13],\nTheorem 1.2 (i)-(ii), and for the formally real case, [13], Proposition 6.4).\nThis statement also shows that the absolute Galois groups of nonreal SQLfields need not be prosolvable and may have a very complex structure:\n(2.2) An abelian torsion group T is isomorphic to Br(E), for some nonreal\nPQL-field E = E(T ) if and only if T is divisible. If T is divisible, S is a\nset of finite groups, E0 is an arbitrary field, and T0 is a subgroup of Br(E0 )\nembeddable in T , then E can be chosen so as to satisfy the following:\n(i) E is quasilocal, P (E) = P and \u03c1E/L surjective, for any finite extension\nL/E (apply also the Albert-Hochschild theorem (cf. [48], Ch. II, 2.2)).\n(ii) E/E0 is an extension, such that E0 is algebraically closed in E, T0 \u2229\nBr(E/E0 ) = {0} and every G \u2208 S is realizable as a Galois group over E.\nWhen the set p T = {t \u2208 T : pt = 0} is infinite, for each p \u2208 P, (2.2)\nimplies the following result (combined with [14], Remark 6.6, it points up\nthe need for the restrictions on the ground fields considered in [27] and [43]):\n(2.3) In order that A, B \u2208 d(E) have a common set of splitting fields\namong the intermediate fields of Esep /E it is necessary and sufficient that\nind(A) = ind(B) [9], I, Corollary 8.5. For each n \u2208 N, d(E) contains infinitely many nonisomorphic E-algebras of index n.\nStatements (2.1) and (2.2) can be supplemented by the following partial\nconversion of the Koenigsmann-Neukirch theorem [26], Theorem B:\n(2.4) If (E, v) is a Henselian quasilocal field, such that all finite groups are\nisomorphic to subquotients of GE (by open normal subgroups), then v(E) is\ndivisible and every D \u2208 d(E) is inertial relative to v [14], Proposition 6.3.\nRemark 2.4. Let T be a divisible abelian torsion group and Supp(T ) the\nset of those p \u2208 P for which the p-component Tp of T is nontrivial. Fix\na field E with Br(E) \u223c\n= T as in (2.2) (i) and denote by Esol the maximal\nGalois extension of E in Esep with a prosolvable Galois group. Then Esol /E\npossesses an intermediate field E \u2032 that is strictly PQL with Br(E \u2032 ) \u223c\n= T (take\n6\n\n\fas E \u2032 , e.g., the fixed field of some Hall pro-Supp(T )-subgroup of G(Esol /E)).\nNote also that if Supp(T ) = P, then E is SQL.\nRemark 2.4 and statements (1.2) (i) and (2.1)\u00f7(2.4) draw interest in the\nfollowing open questions:\n(2.5) (i) Describe the isomorphism classes of Brauer groups of SQL-fields.\n(ii) Let E be an SQL-field with GE prosolvable. Find whether the nonzero\ngroups Br(E)p except, possibly, one are isomorphic to the quasicyclic pgroup Z(p\u221e ). Prove whether the Sylow pro-p-subgroups of GE are of rank\nrp \u2264 2, for all p \u2208 P, with at most 2 exceptions.\n(iii) Let (F, v) be a Henselian quasilocal field with Br(F )\u03c0 and Br(E)\u03c0\u2032\nnot embeddable in Q/Z, for some \u03c0, \u03c0 \u2032 \u2208 P. Is v(F ) divisible?\nThe questions in (2.5) (ii) are related by Galois cohomology (cf. [49], page\n265, [35], (11.5), [48], Ch. I, 4.2, and [53], Lemma 7) and the results of\nSection 5. Also, by [14], (1.4), the assumptions of (2.1) (i) require that\nb In view of [26], Theorem B, one can prove\nrp \u2264 2 whenever p 6= char(E).\nthat a negative answer to the latter question in (2.5) (ii) would imply the\nexistence of a field F with Br(F ) 6= {0} whose nontrivial valuations have\nHenselizations equal to Fsep . Moreover, if 3 \u2264 rp \u2264 rp\u2032 \u2208 N, for some\np, p\u2032 \u2208 P, p < p\u2032 , this would solve affirmatively Problem 11.5.9 (b) in [18].\n\nRemark 2.5. It is known (see [39]) that if E is a field, then the triple AT(E)\ndefined in (1.2) (ii) is an Artin-Tate class formation if and only if E is\nSQL, Br(E) is embeddable in Q/Z, and \u03c1E/R is surjective, for every finite\nextension R of E in Esep . Observing that (2.2) provides access to the richest\npresently known sources of such fields, we add to the examples given after\nthe statement of (1.2) that AT(E) is Artin-Tate when E is an algebraic\nSQL-extension of a global field (see [39] and [12], Sect. 3).\n3. Statements of the main results of local p-class field theory\nOur main results on local p-CFT are stated as the following two theorems:\nTheorem 3.1. Let E be a p-quasilocal field with Br(E)p 6= {0}, for some\np \u2208 P (E), and let \u03a9p (E) and d(p) be as in the Introduction. Then E admits\nlocal p-CFT and, for each M \u2208 \u03a9p (E), E \u2217 /N (M/E) is isomorphic to the\ngroup G(M/E)d(p) defined in Theorem 1.2.\nTheorem 3.1 plays a major role in the proof of the embeddability of Br(E)\ninto Q/Z in case (2.1) (i), which in turn enables one to characterize the\nquasilocal property in the class of Henselian valued fields with totally indivisible value groups (see [14], Sect. 6, and [7], II). Note also that Theorem\n3.1 and Lemma 2.1 imply Theorem 1.2 and the former assertion of Theorem\n1.1. In addition, Theorem 3.1 contains exact analogues to the fundamental\ncorrespondence and the local reciprocity law. Similarly, our next result can\nbe viewed as such an analogue to Hasse's symbol for local fields (see [25],\nCh. 2, as well as Remark 7.1 and Corollary 7.3 below).\n7\n\n\fTheorem 3.2. Under the hypotheses of Theorem 3.1, let E\u221e be a Zp extension of E in E(p), and for any n \u2208 N, let \u0393n be the intermediate\nfield of E\u221e /E of degree [\u0393n : E] = pn . Then there exist sets\nHp (E \u2032 ) = {( , M \u2032 /E \u2032 ) : E \u2032\u2217 \u2192 G(M \u2032 /E \u2032 )d(p) , M \u2032 \u2208 \u03a9p (E \u2032 )}, E \u2032 \u2208 \u03a9p (E),\nof surjective group homomorphisms satisfying the following:\n(i) The kernel of ( , M \u2032 /E \u2032 ) is equal to N (M \u2032 /E \u2032 ), for each E \u2032 \u2208 \u03a9p (E),\n\u2032\nM \u2208 \u03a9p (E \u2032 );\n(ii) If M \u2208 \u03a9p (E) and K is an intermediate field of M/E, then ( , K/E) =\n\u03c0M/K \u25e6( , M/E), where \u03c0M/K : G(M/E)d(p) \u2192 G(K/E)d(p) is the homomorphism acting componentwise as the natural mapping of G(M/E) on G(K/E);\n(iii) In the setting of (ii), (\u03bb, M/K) = (NEK (\u03bb), M/E), for each \u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 ;\n(iv) The maps ( , \u0393n /E), n \u2208 N, determine the sets Hp (E \u2032 ), E \u2032 \u2208 \u03a9p (E).\nThe rest of this Section concerns the open question of whether fields with\nLCFT are strictly PQL. Lemma 2.1 and first result in this direction imply\nthe latter assertion of Theorem 1.1.\nProposition 3.3. Let E be a field admitting local p-CFT, for some p \u2208\nP (E), and let L be a degree p extension of E in E(p). Then Br(L/E) 6= {0}\nand Br(L/E) does not depend on the choice of L. Furthermore, if each\nD \u2208 d(E) of exponent p is similar to tensor products of cyclic division Ealgebras of index p, then E is p-quasilocal.\nProof. Our assumptions ensure that L/E is cyclic, whence Br(L/E) \u223c\n=\nE \u2217 /N (L/E) (cf. [32], Ch. I, Sect. 6, and [41], Sect. 15.1, Proposition b).\nAs E admits local p-CFT and L 6= E, this yields N (L/E) 6= N (E/E) = E \u2217\nand Br(L/E) 6= {0}. In order to complete our proof, it suffices to show that\nL embeds as an E-subalgebra in each cyclic division E-algebra of index p.\nIf G(E(p)/E) is procyclic, this is evident, so we assume that \u03a9p (E) contains\na field F 6= L, such that [F : E] = p. It follows from Galois theory that\nLF \u2208 \u03a9(E), [LF : E] = p2 and G(LF/E) is noncyclic. Therefore, LF/E\npossesses p + 1 intermediate fields of degree p over E. Let F \u2032 be such a\nfield different from L and F . Then N (F/E)N (F \u2032 /E) = E \u2217 and LF \u2032 = LF .\n\u2032\nMoreover, the norm maps NEF and NEF are induced by NLLF , so it turns out\nthat E \u2217 \u2286 N (LF/L). Hence, by [41], Sect. 15.1, Proposition b, L embeds\nover E in each \u2206 \u2208 d(E) split by F , which proves Proposition 3.3.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.4. Let E be a field and p \u2208 P (E).\n(i) If G(E(p)/E) \u223c\n= Zp and L is the unique degree p extension of E in E(p),\nthen E admits local p-CFT if and only if Br(L/E) 6= {0} (apply Proposition\n3.3 and [41], Sect. 15.1, Corollary b).\n(ii) When Br(E)p 6= {0}, the concluding condition of Proposition 3.3 is\nsatisfied in the following cases: (a) E is an algebraic extension of a global or\nlocal field E0 ; (b) E contains a primitive p-th root of unity or char(E) = p;\n(c) p = 3, 5. In cases (b) and (c), this follows from the Merkur'ev-Suslin\ntheorem [35], (16.1), [2], Ch. VII, Theorem 28, [34], Sect. 4, Corollary, and\n[33]. In case (a), by class field theory, every A0 \u2208 s(E0 ) is cyclic (cf. [3], Ch.\n10, Theorem 5), which implies the same, for all A \u2208 s(E).\n8\n\n\f(iii) It is not known whether E is strictly PQL, if it admits LCFT and\nhas a Henselian discrete valuation (see [7], Sect. 2).\nCorollary 3.5. A finite purely inseparable extension K of a field E of characteristic p > 0 admits local p-CFT if and only if so does E.\nProof. By [9], I, Proposition 4.4, E is p-quasilocal if and only if K is pquasilocal, and by the Albert-Hochschild theorem, \u03c1E/K is surjective. Since\nthe exponent of Br(K/E) divides [K : E] (see [41], Sects. 13.4 and 14.4),\nand by Witt's theorem (cf. [16], page 110), Br(E)p and Br(K)p are divisible,\nthis implies that Br(E)p 6= {0} \u2194 Br(K)p 6= {0}, so Corollary 3.5 follows\nfrom Theorem 3.1 and Remark 3.4 (ii).\n\u0003\nThe concluding result of this Section clarifies the role of SQL-fields in\nLCFT. In view of (2.2), Remark 2.5 and the main results of [13], it also\ndetermines the place in the study of strictly PQL-fields of the NeukirchPerlis variant of the theory [39], built upon (1.2) (ii).\nProposition 3.6. A field E is SQL if and only if its finite extensions admit LCFT. When occurs, Br(Ep ) 6= {0}, provided that Ep is the fixed field\nof a Sylow pro-p-subgroup of GE , where p \u2208 P is chosen so that GE is of\ncohomological p-dimension cdp (GE ) 6= 0.\nProof. The left-to-right implication is contained in Theorem 1.1, so we prove\nthe converse one and the nontriviality of Br(Ep )p , for any p \u2208 P satisfying\ncdp (GE ) 6= 0. Suppose that every finite extension L of E admits LCFT, and\nBp is the extension of E generated by the p-th roots of unity in Esep . It\nis known (cf. [32], Ch. VIII, Sect. 3) that Bp \u2286 Ep , i.e. Ep contains a\nprimitive p-th root of unity unless p = char(E). Also, Proposition 3.3 and\nRemark 3.4 (ii) indicate that L is p-quasilocal, provided that Bp \u2286 L. As\np \u2020 [L\u2032 : E], for any finite extension L\u2032 of E in Ep , this enables one to obtain\nfrom general properties of scalar extension maps and Schur indices (cf. [41],\nSect. 13.4, and [9], I, (1.3)) that Ep is p-quasilocal. Moreover, it follows\nfrom [9], I, Lemma 8.3, and the choice of p that E is quasilocal. Since, by\nProposition 3.3, PQL-fields with LCFT are strictly PQL, the obtained result\nshows that E is SQL. Note further that the inequality cdp (GE ) 6= 0 ensures\nthe existence of finite Galois extensions of E in Esep of degrees divisible by p.\nTherefore, by Sylow's theorems and Galois theory, there is a finite extension\nL0 of E in Ep , such that p \u2208 P (L0 ). As in the proof of the statement that Ep\nis p-quasilocal, these observations imply p \u2208 P (Ep ) and Br(Ep ) 6= {0}. \u0003\nLet us note that the abstract approach to LCFT dates back to the early\n1950's (cf. [3], Sect. 14). It fits the character of the related class formation\ntheory, see [23], and accounts for the fact that the Neukirch-Perlis variant\nof LCFT goes substantially beyond the limits of (2.1). The fact itself is\nestablished by summing up Proposition 3.6, Remark 2.5, statements (2.1),\n(2.2) and (2.4), and the results on (2.5) (ii) mentioned in Section 2.\n9\n\n\f4. Proof of Theorem 3.1\nLet E be a p-quasilocal field, for a given p \u2208 P (E). By Proposition\n2.2 (iv), then Br(M/E) = {b \u2208 Br(E) : [M : E]b = 0}, for every cyclic pextension M/E. Hence, by the structure of divisible abelian torsion groups,\nand by the fact that Br(M/E) \u223c\n= E \u2217 /N (M/E) (cf. [19], Theorem 23.1, and\n[41], Sect. 15.1, Proposition b), E \u2217 /N (M/E) \u223c\n= G(M/E)d(p) . To prove the\nobtained isomorphism, for any M \u2208 \u03a9p (E), we need the following lemmas.\nLemma 4.1. Let E be a p-quasilocal field, for some p \u2208 P (E), and let\nE1 , . . . Et be cyclic extensions of E in E(p), for a given integer t \u2265 2. Assume that the compositum E \u2032 of the fields Ej : j = 1, . . . , t, satisfies the\nQ\nT\nequality [E \u2032 : E] = tj=1 [Ej : E]. Then N (E \u2032 /E) = tj=1 N (Ej /E).\nT\nProof. The inclusion N (E \u2032 /E) \u2286 tj=1 N (Ej /E) follows from the transitivity of norm maps in towers of finite separable extensions (cf. [32], Ch.\nT\nVIII, Sect. 5). Conversely, let c \u2208 tj=1 N (Ej /E) and \u03b2 \u2208 E1\u2217 be of norm\nQ\nNEE1 (\u03b2) = c. The equality [E \u2032 : E] = tj=1 [Ej : E], Galois theory and [6],\nT\nQ\nLemma 4.2, imply [E \u2032 : E1 ] = ti=2 [(E1 Ei ) : E1 ] and \u03b2 \u2208 ti=2 N (E1 Ei /E1 ).\nThis proves Lemma 4.1 in the case where t = 2. Since (E1 Ei )/E1 is cyclic,\nfor each i \u2265 2, and by Proposition 2.2 (i), E1 is p-quasilocal, the obtained\nresult makes it easy to complete our proof by induction on t.\n\u0003\nLemma 4.2. Assume that E, F and L are fields, such that E is p-quasilocal,\nL \u2208 \u03a9p (E), E \u2286 F \u2286 L and F/E is cyclic. Then \u03c8(\u03b1)\u03b1\u22121 \u2208 N (L/F ), for\neach \u03b1 \u2208 F \u2217 and \u03c8 \u2208 G(F/E).\nProof. As F is p-quasilocal and L \u2208 \u03a9p (F ), whence G(L/F ) decomposes into\na direct product of cyclic groups, Galois theory and Lemma 4.1 allow one to\nconsider only the case in which L/F is cyclic. Let \u03c8 \u2032 be an automorphism\nof L extending \u03c8. Fix a generator \u03c3 of G(L/F ), denote by A\u03b1 the cyclic\nF -algebra (L/F, \u03c3, \u03b1), for an arbitrary \u03b1 \u2208 F \u2217 , put m = [L : F ], and take\nan invertible element \u03b7 \u2208 A\u03b1 so that \u03b7 m = \u03b1 and \u03b7\u03bb\u03b7 \u22121 = \u03c3(\u03bb), for every\n\u03bb \u2208 L. Then Proposition 2.2 (iii) and the Skolem-Noether theorem (cf.\n[41], Sect. 12.6) imply that A\u03b1 has a ring automorphism \u03c8\u0303, such that \u03c8\u0303(\u03bb)\n= \u03c8 \u2032 (\u03bb), for any \u03bb \u2208 L. Since \u03c3\u03c8 \u2032 = \u03c8 \u2032 \u03c3, this ensures that the element\n\u03b7 \u22121 \u03c8\u0303(\u03b7) := \u03bc lies in the centralizer of L in A\u03b1 . Thereby, we have \u03bc \u2208 L\u2217\nand \u03c8\u0303(\u03b7)m = \u03c8(\u03b1) = \u03b7 m NFL (\u03bc) = \u03b1NFL (\u03bc), which proves Lemma 4.2.\n\u0003\nAssuming that E is a p-quasilocal field, Mu \u2208 \u03a9p (E), [Mu : E] = p\u03bcu : u =\n1, 2, and putting M \u2032 = M1 M2 , we prove the following assertions:\n(4.1) (i) If N (M1 /E) = N (M2 /E) and M1 \u2286 M2 , then M1 = M2 ;\n(ii) If M1 \u2229 M2 = E, then N (M1 /E) \u2229 N (M2 /E) = N (M \u2032 /E),\nN (M1 /E)N (M2 /E) = E \u2217 , each \u03c3 \u2208 G(M2 /E) has a unique prolongation\n\u03c3 \u2032 \u2208 G(M \u2032 /M1 ), and the mapping of G(M2 /E) on G(M \u2032 /M1 ) by the rule\n\u03c3 \u2192 \u03c3 \u2032 is an isomorphism;\n(iii) Under the hypotheses of (ii), if M2 /E is cyclic and G(M2 /E) = h\u03c3i,\nthen G(M \u2032 /M1 ) = h\u03c3 \u2032 i and CorM1 /E maps Br(M \u2032 /M1 ) into Br(M2 /E)\n10\n\n\fby the formula [(M \u2032 /M1 , \u03c3 \u2032 , \u03b8)] \u2192 [(M2 /E, \u03c3, NEM1 (\u03b8))], \u03b8 \u2208 M1\u2217 ; when\nBr(E)p is divisible, CorM1 /E induces isomorphisms Br(M1 )p \u223c\n= Br(E)p and\nBr(M \u2032 /M1 ) \u223c\n= Br(M2 /E).\nIt is sufficient to consider the special case where Mu 6= E : u = 1, 2,\nand M1 6= M2 . In view of Proposition 2.2 (ii), then Br(E)p is divisible.\nAt the same time, Galois theory and the assumptions on M1 /E imply the\nexistence of a cyclic degree p extension M0 of E in M1 . Suppose that\nM1 \u2286 M2 and d \u2208 N (Mu /E) : u = 1, 2, fix a generator \u03c8 of G(M0 /E)\nand elements \u03b7j \u2208 Mj\u2217 , j = 1, 2, so that NEM1 (\u03b71 ) = NEM2 (\u03b72 ) = d. It\nM1\nM2\n(\u03b71 ) = NM\n(\u03b72 )\u03c8(\u03b2)\u03b2 \u22121 , for\nfollows from Hilbert's Theorem 90 that NM\n0\n0\n\u2217\nsome \u03b2 \u2208 M0 . Hence, by Lemma 4.2, N (M1 /E) = N (M2 /E) if and only\nif N (M1 /M0 ) = N (M2 /M0 ). Observing also that M0 is p-quasilocal and\n[M1 : M0 ] = p\u03bc1 \u22121 , and proceeding by induction on \u03bc1 , one proves (4.1) (i).\nAssume now that M1 \u2229 M2 = E. Then the Galois-theoretic parts of (4.1)\n(ii) and (iii) are contained in [32], Ch. VIII, Theorem 4. The rest of the\nformer assertion of (4.1) (iii) is implied by Proposition 2.2 (iii), the basic\nrestriction-corestriction (abbr, RC) formula (cf. [50], Theorem 2.5) and the\nlemmas in [6], Sect. 4. The equality N (M \u2032 /E) = N (M1 /E) \u2229 N (M2 /E)\nfollows from the presentability of M1 and M2 as compositums of cyclic extensions of E satisfying the conditions of Lemma 4.1. It remains for us\nto show that N (M1 /E)N (M2 /E) = E \u2217 and to prove the latter part of\n(4.1) (iii). Suppose first that M2 /E is cyclic and the automorphisms \u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032\nare determined as in (4.1) (iii), fix an element c \u2208 E \u2217 out of N (M2 /E),\nand put Ac = (M2 /E, \u03c3, c). It is clear from [41], Sect. 15.1, Proposition b, and the choice of c that ind(Ac ) | p\u03bc2 and ind(Ac ) > 1. As\nBr(E)p is divisible, there exists \u2206c \u2208 d(E), such that p\u03bc1 [\u2206c ] = [Ac ]. In\naddition, it follows from Proposition 2.2 (i) that ind(\u2206c ) = p\u03bc1 .ind(Ac ).\nObserving also that [M \u2032 : E] = p\u03bc and ind(\u2206c ) | p\u03bc , where \u03bc = \u03bc1 +\n\u03bc2 , one obtains from Proposition 2.2 (iv) that [\u2206c ] \u2208 Br(M \u2032 /E). Since\n\u2206c \u2297 E M \u2032 \u223c\n= (\u2206c \u2297E M1 ) \u2297M1 M \u2032 as M \u2032 -algebras (cf. [41], Sect. 9.4,\nCorollary a), this means that [\u2206c \u2297E M1 ] \u2208 Br(M \u2032 /M1 ), or equivalently,\nthat [\u2206c \u2297E M1 ] = [(M \u2032 /M1 , \u03c3 \u2032 , \u03b1)], for some \u03b1 \u2208 M1\u2217 . Therefore, by\nProposition 2.2 (iii), the RC-formula and the former statement of (4.1)\n(iii), [Ac ] = [(M2 /E, \u03c3, NEM1 (\u03b1))]. As [Ac : E] = [(M2 /E, \u03c3, NEM1 (\u03b1)) : E]\n= [M2 : E]2 , this proves that Ac \u223c\n= (M2 /E, \u03c3, NEM1 (\u03b1)) over E. Hence,\nby [41], Sect. 15.1, Proposition b, c.NEM1 (\u03b1)\u22121 \u2208 N (M2 /E), which yields\nN (M1 /E)N (M2 /E) = E \u2217 in case M2 /E is cyclic. Our argument, combined\nwith Proposition 2.2 (ii)-(iii) and the RC-formula, also proves the latter part\nof (4.1) (iii). Henceforth, we assume that M2 /E is noncyclic, i.e. G(M2 /E)\nis an abelian p-group of rank r \u2265 2. Then it follows from Galois theory\nand the structure of finite abelian groups that there exist cyclic extensions\nF1 and F2 of E in M2 such that F1 \u2229 F2 = E and the p-groups G(M2 /F1 )\nand G(M2 /F2 ) are of rank r \u2212 1. As M1 \u2229 M2 = E, one also sees that\n(M1 Fu )\u2229M2 = Fu : u = 1, 2. Taking now into account that F1 and F2 are pquasilocal fields, and arguing by induction on r, one concludes that it suffices\nto deduce the equality N (M1 /E)N (M2 /E) = E \u2217 under the extra hypothesis\nthat N (M1 Fu /Fu )N (M2 /Fu ) = Fu\u2217 : u = 1, 2. Then, by norm transitivity in\n11\n\n\ftowers of finite extensions, N (F1 /E)N (F2 /E) \u2286 N (M1 /E)N (M2 /E), and\nsince N (F1 /E)N (F2 /E) = E \u2217 , this completes the proof of (4.1).\nRemark 4.3. Let E be a field and M1 , M2 be finite extensions of E in\nEsep , such that M2 /E is cyclic and M1 \u2229 M2 = E. It is known that then the\nformer statement of (4.1) (iii) remains valid. The assertions on G(M2 /E) and\nG(M \u2032 /M1 ) follow from [32], Ch. VIII, Theorem 4, and the formula for the\naction of CorM1 /E on Br(M \u2032 /M1 ) can be proved by a group-cohomological\ntechnique (cf. [54], Proposition 4.3.7). It is therefore worth noting that\n(4.1) (iii) plays a role in the proof not only of Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 but\nalso of Proposition 2.2 (i) (see [9], I, Sect. 7). This, combined with [13],\nTheorem 1.2 (i)-(ii), enables one to find alternative field-theoretic proofs\nof the formula in (4.1) (iii) and of other results on CorF/E , for any finite\nextension F of E in Esep (by reduction to the setting of (2.2) (i), see [10]).\nWe are now in a position to prove Theorem 3.1 (and thereby, Theorem 1.2\nand the former part of Theorem 1.1 as well). Assuming as above that Mu \u2208\n\u03a9p (E) : u = 1, 2, and M1 M2 = M \u2032 , put L\u2032 = M1 \u2229 M2 . We first show that\nN (L\u2032 /E) = N (M1 /E)N (M2 /E) and N (M \u2032 /E) = N (M1 /E) \u2229 N (M2 /E).\nIn view of (4.1) (ii), it suffices to consider the case where L\u2032 6= E. As L\u2032\nis p-quasilocal, (4.1) (ii) yields L\u2032\u2217 = N (M1 /L\u2032 )N (M2 /L\u2032 ), so the equality\nN (L\u2032 /E) = N (M1 /E)N (M2 /E) is obtained from norm transitivity in the\ntowers E \u2282 L\u2032 \u2286 Mu : u = 1, 2. Suppose further that [L\u2032 : E] = pm and fix\na degree p extension L of E in L\u2032 . As in the proof of (4.1) (i), it is seen\nthat an element \u03bb \u2208 L\u2217 lies in N (Mi /L), for some i \u2208 {1, 2}, if and only if\nNEL (\u03bb) \u2208 N (Mi /E). Since [L\u2032 : L] = pm\u22121 and L is p-quasilocal, this makes it\neasy to prove inductively that N (M \u2032 /E) = N (M1 /E)\u2229N (M2 /E). It follows\nfrom this result and (4.1) (i) that the natural mapping \u03a9p (E) \u2192 Nr(E) is\ninjective. Thus the statement that E admits local p-CFT is proved, which\nallows us to deduce Theorem 1.1 from Lemma 2.1 and Proposition 3.3.\nTo finish the proof of Theorem 3.1 (and Theorem 1.2) we show that\nE \u2217 /N (M/E) \u223c\n= G(M/E)d(p) , provided that M \u2208 \u03a9p (E) and G(M/E) is\nnoncyclic. Then G(M/E) is an abelian p-group of rank r(M ) \u2265 2, so it\nfollows from Galois theory that M/E has intermediate fields \u03a61 and \u03a62 , such\nthat \u03a61 \u03a62 = M , \u03a61 \u2229 \u03a62 = E and \u03a62 /E is cyclic. This means that G(M/E)\nis isomorphic to the direct product G(\u03a61 /E) \u00d7 G(\u03a62 /E), and G(\u03a61 /E) is of\nrank r(M ) \u2212 1 as a p-group. Since N (\u03a61 /E)N (\u03a62 /E) = E \u2217 and N (\u03a61 /E) \u2229\nN (\u03a62 /E) = N (M/E), the natural diagonal embedding of E \u2217 into E \u2217 \u00d7 E \u2217\ninduces a group isomorphism E \u2217 /N (M/E) \u223c\n= E \u2217 /N (\u03a61 /E) \u00d7 E \u2217 /N (\u03a62 /E).\nNow our proof is easily completed proceeding by induction on r(M ).\nRemark 4.4. Given a PQL-field E, denote by c(M ) the intersection of fields\nN \u2208 \u03a9(E) with N (N/E) = N (M/E), for each M \u2208 \u03a9(E). It follows from\nTheorem 3.1, Lemma 2.1 and [9], I, Lemma 4.2 (ii), that the natural map\n\u03bd of \u03a9(E) on the set Nab (E) = {N (M/E) : M \u2208 \u03a9(E)} satisfies (1.1).\nTherefore, Br(E)p 6= {0} and p \u2020 [M : c(M )] whenever M \u2208 \u03a9(E) and p \u2208 P\ndivides [c(M ) : E]. Note also that N (c(M )/E) = N (M/E) and N (M0 /E) 6=\nN (M/E) in case M0 \u2208 \u03a9(E), M0 \u2286 c(M ) and M0 6= c(M ). Since the set\nCl(E) = {c(\u039b) : \u039b \u2208 \u03a9(E)} is closed under taking subextensions of E and\n12\n\n\ffinite compositums, whence \u03bd induces a bijection of Cl(E) on Nab (E), these\nobservations allow us to view c(M ) as a class field of N (M/E).\n\n5. Galois cohomological interpretation of Theorem 3.1\nIn this Section we consider some Galois cohomological aspects of the problem of characterizing fields with LCFT. Let P an infinite pro-p-group, cd(P )\nthe cohomological dimension of P and Fp a field with p elements, for some\np \u2208 P. We say that P is a p-group of Demushkin type, if the (continuous) cohomology group homomorphism \u03c6h : H 1 (P, Fp ) \u2192 H 2 (P, Fp ) mapping each g \u2208 H 1 (P, Fp ) into the cup-product h \u222a g is surjective, for every\nh \u2208 H 1 (P, Fp ) \\ {0}. We call a degree of P the dimension of H 2 (P, Fp ) as an\nFp -vector space. The defined groups and local p-CFT are related as follows:\nProposition 5.1. Let E be a nonreal field containing a primitive p-th root\nof unity, for some p \u2208 P (E). Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) E admits local p-CFT;\n(ii) G(E(p)/E) is a p-group of Demushkin type of degree d \u2265 1;\n(iii) E is p-quasilocal with Br(E)p 6= {0};\n(iv) cd(G(E(p)/E)) = 2 and p Br(E \u2032 ) is a trivial module over the integral\ngroup ring Z[G(E \u2032 /E)], for every degree p extension E \u2032 of E in E(p).\nProof. The equivalence (i)\u2194(iii) is implied by Proposition 3.3, Remark 3.4\n(ii) and Theorem 3.1. Note also that Br(E)p = {0} if and only if G(E(p)/E)\nis a free pro-p-group, i.e. a p-group of Demushkin type of degree zero (cf.\n[52], Theorem 3.1, [53], page 725, and [48], Ch. I, 4.1 and 4.2). In particular, this holds when G(E(p)/E) is of rank 1 as a pro-p-group, since then\nG(E(p)/E) \u223c\n= Zp (see, e.g., [9], I, Remark 3.4 (ii)). These observations, [9],\nI, Lemma 3.8, and the end of Proposition 2.2 (ii) prove that (ii)\u2194(iii). It remains to be seen that (iii)\u2194(iv). As E is nonreal and p \u2208 P (E), one obtains\nfrom Galois theory and [56], Theorem 2, that G(E(p)/E) possesses a closed\nnormal subgroup H, such that G(E(p)/E)/H \u223c\n= Zp . Since Br(E)p 6= {0},\nthis means that H 6= {1}, so it follows from [9], I, Proposition 4.6 (ii), and\nGalois cohomology (see [48], Ch. I, 4.2 and Proposition 15) that cd(H) = 1\nand cd(G(E(p)/E)) = 2. Hence, by Teichm\u00fcller's theorem (cf. [16], Ch. 9,\nTheorem 4) and Proposition 2.2 (iii), (iii)\u2192(iv). To prove that (iv)\u2192(iii)\nwe need the following results (see [35], (11.5), and [24], Proposition 3.26):\n(5.1) If F is a field containing a primitive p-th root of unity, and M is\na finite Galois extension of F in F (p), then there exists an isomorphism\n\u03baM : H 2 (G(F (p)/M ), Fp ) \u223c\n= p Br(M ) as Z[G(M/F )]-modules, and the compositions CorM/F \u25e6 \u03baM and \u03baF \u25e6 corM/F coincide, where corM/F is the corestriction map H 2 (G(F (p)/M ), Fp ) \u2192 H 2 (G(F (p)/F ), Fp ). Hence, CorM/F\nis surjective if and only if so is corM/F .\nIt suffices to show that Br(E \u2032 /E) = p Br(E), for an arbitrary degree p extension E \u2032 of E in E(p). The equality cd(G(E(p)/E)) = 2 ensures that\nBr(E)p 6= {0} and it follows from (5.1) and [40], Proposition 3.3.8, that\n13\n\n\fCorE \u2032 /E maps p Br(E \u2032 ) surjectively on p Br(E). We show that p Br(E \u2032 ) includes the preimage \u03a0p (E) of p Br(E) in Br(E \u2032 )p under CorE \u2032 /E . Our assumptions guarantee (in conjunction with Galois theory and the normality\nof maximal subgroups of finite p-groups, see [32], Ch. VIII and Ch. I, Sect.\n6) that E \u2032 /E is cyclic. Observe also that Br(E \u2032 )p is a trivial Z[G(E \u2032 /E)]module. Indeed, let \u03c3 be a generator of G(E \u2032 /E), and let b \u2208 Br(E \u2032 ) be an\nelement of order pk , for some k \u2208 N. Proceeding by induction on k, one sees\nthat it suffices to prove that \u03c3(b) = b, provided that k \u2265 2 and \u03c3(b) = b + b0 ,\nfor some b0 \u2208p Br(E \u2032 ). The assumption on b0 indicates that CorE \u2032 /E (b0 ) = 0,\nso it follows from (5.1) and [31], Corollary, that b0 = a \u2212 \u03c3(a), for some a \u2208\n\u2032\np Br(E ). This yields \u03c3(b + a) = b + a, which implies \u03c3(b) = b and our assertion about Br(E \u2032 )p (because p Br(E \u2032 ) is a trivial Z[G(E \u2032 /E)]-module). By\nTeichm\u00fcller's theorem, the established property of Br(E \u2032 )p is equivalent to\nthe inclusion of Br(E \u2032 )p in the image of \u03c1E/E \u2032 . Since CorE \u2032 /E maps p Br(E \u2032 )\nsurjectively upon p Br(E), it is now easy to obtain from the RC-formula\nthat \u03a0p (E) \u2286 p Br(E \u2032 ). Moreover, it becomes clear that the implication\n(iv)\u2192(iii) will follow, if we show that p Br(E) is included in the subgroup\npBr(E)p = {p\u03b2 : \u03b2 \u2208 Br(E)p } of Br(E)p . Denote by B the extension of\nE in E(p) obtained by adjunction of a primitive p2 -th root of unity. It\nfollows from [35], (16.1), [41], Sect. 15.1, Corollary b, and Kummer theory that p Br(B) \u2286 pBr(B)p . Hence, the surjectivity of the homomorphism\np Br(B) \u2192 p Br(E) induced by CorB/E implies p Br(E) \u2286 pBr(E)p . Therefore, Br(E \u2032 /E) = p Br(E) and (iv)\u2192(iii), so Proposition 5.1 is proved.\n\u0003\nCorollary 5.2. Let E be an SQL-field, such that cdp (GE ) 6= 0, for a given\np \u2208 P. Then the Sylow pro-p-subgroups of GE are p-groups of Demushkin\ntype of degree dp \u2265 1, unless p = char(E) or E is formally real and p = 2.\nProof. One may consider only the special case of Esep = E(p) (see the proof\nof Proposition 3.6). Then Br(E)p 6= {0} and our conclusion follows from\nPropositions 5.1, 2.2 (ii) and [48], Ch. II, Proposition 3.\n\u0003\nIt is easily seen that the degrees of p-groups of Demushkin type are\nbounded by their ranks. The following conversion of this fact can be deduced\nfrom [35], (11.5), Proposition 5.1, [9], I, Theorem 8.1, and the sufficiency\npart of (2.2) (by specifying the cardinalities of the fields E0 and E in (2.2)\n(ii), see [13], Remark 5.4, for more details):\n(5.2) For any system d \u2265 \u05d00 and dp \u2264 d : p \u2208 P, of cardinal numbers,\nthere is a field E containing a primitive p-th root of unity, for every p \u2208 P,\nand such that G(E(p)/E) and the Sylow pro-p-subgroups of GE are of rank\nd, Demushkin type and degree dp .\nBy a Demushkin pro-p-group, we mean a p-group of Demushkin type of\ndegree 1. Demushkin pro-p-groups of rank r(P ) \u2264 \u05d00 have been classified\nby Demushkin, Labute and Serre (cf. [29, 30] and further references there).\nWhen r(P ) = \u05d00 , by [36] and [37], P has s-invariant zero if and only if\nP \u223c\n= G(F (p)/F ), for some field F . Hence, by applying Lemma 3.5 of [7]\n(in a modified form adjusted to the case singled out by [37], Proposition 3.1\n(iii)), and arguing as in the proof of (5.2), one supplements it as follows:\n14\n\n\f(5.3) For each sequence Gp : p \u2208 P, of Demushkin pro-p-groups of rank\n\u05d00 and s-invariant zero, there exists a field E such that G(E(p)/E) and the\nSylow pro-p-subgroups of GE are isomorphic to Gp when p ranges over P.\n\nNext we show that the inequality d \u2265 \u05d00 in (5.2) is essential. This result\nis a special case of [28], Corollary 5 (see also [31], Sects. 1 and 2). For\nconvenience of the reader, we present it here with a short proof based on\nTheorem 3.1 and Proposition 5.1.\nCorollary 5.3. Let E be a field containing a primitive p-th root of unity, for\nsome p \u2208 P (E), and with G(E(p)/E) a p-group of Demushkin type of finite\nrank r(p). Then G(E(p)/E) is a Demushkin group or a free pro-p-group.\n\nProof. In view of [53], Lemma 7, and Proposition 5.1 (with its proof), one\nmay consider only the case where r(p) \u2265 3 and Br(E)p 6= {0}. Take a field\nE \u2032 \u2208 \u03a9(E) so that G(E \u2032 /E) has exponent p and order pr(p)\u22121 . By Theorem\n3.1 and [35], (11.5), then E \u2217p \u2286 N (E \u2032 /E) and N (E \u2032 /E) is a subgroup of E \u2217\nof index p(r(p)\u22121).dp , so we have (r(p)\u22121).dp \u2264 r(p), where dp is the degree of\nG(E(p)/E). In our case, this implies dp = 1, which proves Corollary 5.3. \u0003\nRemark 5.4. Statement (5.1) and Corollary 5.3 show that the equivalence\n(ii)\u2194(iv) in Proposition 5.1 generalizes the concluding assertion of [31], Theorem 1 (independently of the elementary type conjecture formulated in [31]).\nCorollary 5.3 gives us the possibility to determine the structure of the continuous character group C(E(p)/E) of G(E(p)/E), for a p-quasilocal nonreal\nfield E containing a primitive p-th root of unity. Recall that C(E(p)/E)\nis an abelian torsion p-group, whence, it decomposes into the direct sum\nD(E(p)/E) \u2295 R(E(p)/E), where D(E(p)/E) is the maximal divisible subgroup of C(E(p)/E) and R(E(p)/E) is a (reduced) subgroup of C(E(p)/E)\nisomorphic to C(E(p)/E)/D(E(p)/E) (see [22], Ch. 7, Sect. 5, and [19],\nTheorem 24.5). With this notation, our next result can be stated as follows:\nProposition 5.5. Let E be a p-quasilocal nonreal field, \u03bcp (E) the group of\nroots of unity in E of p-primary degrees, and rp (E) the rank of G(E(p)/E)\nas a pro-p-group. Suppose that \u03bcp (E) 6= {1} and \u03b5p \u2208 E is a primitive p-th\nroot of unity. Then:\n(a) C(E(p)/E) = D(E(p)/E) if and only if \u03bcp (E) is infinite or Br(E)p =\n{0}; when Br(E)p 6= {0} and \u03bcp (E) is finite of order p\u03bd , the group R(E(p)/E)\nis isomorphic to the maximal subgroup of Br(E) of period p\u03bd ;\n(b) Br(E)p is embeddable as a subgroup of D(E(p)/E).\nProof. (a): It follows from Kummer theory that C(E(p)/E) = D(E(p)/E),\nprovided that \u03bcp (E) is infinite. We show that the same equality holds in the\ncase of Br(E)p = {0}. Then it follows from [41], Sect. 15.1, Proposition b,\nthat \u03b5p lies in the norm group N (L\u2032 /E), for every cyclic extension L\u2032 of E in\nE(p); hence, by Albert's height theorem (cf. [1], Ch. IX, Sect. 6, and [17],\nSect. 2), there is a cyclic extension L\u20321 of E in E(p), such that L\u2032 \u2208 I(L\u20321 /E)\nand [L\u20321 : L\u2032 ] = p. This implies L\u2032 \u2208 I(L1 /E), for some Zp -extension L1 of E\nin E(p), and so proves that C(E(p)/E) = D(E(p)/E). It remains to consider\n15\n\n\fthe case where Br(E)p 6= {0} and \u03bcp (E) has finite order p\u03bd . As \u03bcp (E) 6= {1},\nthen we have E(p) 6= E, so it follows from [56], Theorem 2, and the condition\nthat E is a nonreal field that E(p) contains as a subfield a Zp -extension\nof E. In view of Galois theory, this means that C(E(p)/E) possesses a\nquasicyclic p-subgroup, which proves that D(E(p)/E) 6= {0}. Note further\nthat Br(E)p is a divisible group, since E is nonreal and p-quasilocal (cf. [9],\nI, Theorem 3.1). Therefore, by [19], Theorem 23.1, Br(E)p decomposes into\nthe direct sum Z(p\u221e )d(p) of isomorphic copies of the quasicyclic p-group\nZ(p\u221e ), indexed by a set I of cardinality d(p) equal to the dimension of\n\u223c 2\np Br(E) = H (G(E(p)/E), Fp ) as an Fp -vector space. Moreover, it becomes\nclear that, for each m \u2208 N, the maximal subgroup of Br(E)p of period pm\ndecomposes into a direct sum of cyclic groups of order pm , indexed by I.\nThus the latter conclusion of Proposition 5.5 (a) is equivalent to the former\npart of the following assertions:\n(5.4) (a) C(E(p)/E) and the direct sum D(E(p)/E) \u2295 \u03bcp (E)d(p) are isomorphic, where \u03bcp (E)d(p) is a direct sum of isomorphic copies of \u03bcp (E),\nindexed by a set of cardinality d(p) (for a proof, see [4], II, Lemma 2.3).\n(b) A cyclic extension M of E in E(p) is a subfield of a Zp -extension of\nE in E(p) if and only if there is M \u2032 \u2208 I(E(p)/M ), such that M \u2032 /E is cyclic\nand [M \u2032 : M ] = p\u03bd ; this is the case if and only if \u03bcp (E) \u2282 N (M/E).\n\nThe former part of (5.4) (b) is implied by (5.4) (a) and Galois theory, and\nthe latter one follows from Albert's height theorem.\n(b): Proposition 5.5 (a) allows us to consider only the case where Br(E)p 6=\n{0} and \u03bcp (E) has order p\u03bd , for some \u03bd \u2208 N. Then it follows from (5.4) (a)\nand the nontriviality of D(E(p)/E) that rp (E) \u2265 2. Using the observations\npreceding the statement of (5.4), one also sees that it is sufficient to prove the\nembeddability of p Br(E) in D(E(p)/E). Let now \u03b4\u03bd be a primitive p\u03bd -th root\nof unity, and M\u03bb be an extension of E generated by a p-th root \u03b7\u03bb \u2208 E(p) of\nan element \u03bb \u2208 E \u2217 \\ E \u2217p . Then M\u03bb /E is cyclic, [M\u03bb : E] = p and G(M\u03bb /E)\ncontains a generator \u03c3\u03bb , such that the cyclic E-algebra (M\u03bb /E, \u03c3\u03bb , \u03b4\u03bd ) is\nisomorphic to the symbol E-algebra A\u03b5p (\u03bb, \u03b4\u03bd ; E). It is well-known that\nA\u03b5p (\u03bb, \u03b4\u03bd ; E) and A\u03b5p (\u03b4\u03bd , \u03bb; E) are inversely-isomorphic E-algebras. This,\ncombined with [41], Sect. 15.1, Proposition b, implies \u03b4\u03bd \u2208 N (M\u03bb /E) if\nand only if \u03bb \u2208 N (M\u03b4\u03bd /E). Hence, by (5.4) (b), the divisibility of Br(E)p ,\nand Theorem 23.1 of [19], Proposition 5.5 (b) and the latter assertion of\nProposition 5.5 (a) are equivalent to the statement that p Br(E) embeds as\na subgroup of N (M\u03b4\u03bd /E)/E \u2217p . Since N (M\u03b4\u03bd /E)/E \u2217p is an abelian group of\nperiod p, this amounts to proving that p Br(E) is its homomorphic image.\nWe show that p Br(E) is a homomorphic image of N (M\u03bc /E)/E \u2217p , for an\narbitrary element \u03bc \u2208 E \u2217 \\ E \u2217p . Fix \u03bc\u2032 \u2208 E \u2217 \\ E \u2217p so that M\u03bc\u2032 6= M\u03bc .\nThen E \u2217 /N (M\u03bc\u2032 /E) \u223c\n= p Br(E), by [41], Sect. 15.1, Proposition b (and the\np-quasilocality of E), and N (M\u03bc /E)N (M\u03bc\u2032 /E) = E \u2217 , by [9], I, Lemma 4.3.\nSince, by Theorem 3.1, N (M\u03bc /E) \u2229 N (M\u03bc\u2032 /E) = N (M\u03bc M\u03bc\u2032 /E), this yields\n\u223c N (M\u03bc /E)/N (M\u03bc M\u03bc\u2032 /E), E \u2217p \u2264 N (M\u03bc M\u03bc\u2032 /E) and\nE \u2217 /N (M\u03bc\u2032 /E) =\nN (M\u03bc /E)/N (M\u03bc M\u03bc\u2032 /E) \u223c\n= (N (M\u03bc /E)/E \u2217p )/(N (M\u03bc M\u03bc\u2032 /E)/E \u2217p );\nin particular, p Br(E) is a homomorphic image of N (M\u03bc /E)/E \u2217p , which\ncompletes the proof of Proposition 5.5 (b).\n\u0003\n16\n\n\fThe concluding results of this Section present applications of Proposition\n5.5 and Corollary 5.3 to the study of p-primary index-exponent K-pairs, for a\nb for some p \u2208 P. Recall first\nHenselian field (K, v) with a p-quasilocal field K,\nthat, for any field E and each D \u2208 d(E), exp(D) divides ind(D) and is divisible by any p \u2208 P dividing ind(D); in addition, (ind(D), exp(D))is obtained\nas a componentwise product of index-exponent l-pairs, where l runs across\nthe set of prime divisors of ind(D) (see [41], Sect. 14.4). Index-exponent relations of algebras from d(E) depend essentially on specific properties of E,\nand their description reduces to the special case of algebras Dp \u2208 d(E) of pprimary dimensions, for an arbitrary p \u2208 P. The study of index-exponent pprimary E-pairs relies on the knowledge of the Brauer p-dimension Brdp (E),\ndefined as the least integer b(p) \u2265 0, for which ind(Dp ) divides exp(Dp )b(p)\nwhenever Dp \u2208 d(E) and [Dp ] \u2208 Br(E)p ; when no such b(p) exists, we\nsay that Brdp (E) is infinite. Note that (pk , pn ) : k, n \u2208 N, k \u2265 n, are indexexponent L-pairs whenever (L, \u03bb) is a Henselian field, such that the quotient\nb is a nonreal field\ngroup \u03bb(L)/p\u03bb(L) of the value group \u03bb(L) is infinite, L\nb 6= {1}. This is demonstrated by the proof of [11], Corollary 4.5,\nand \u03bcp (L)\nb is\nwhich also shows that the result does not change, if the condition on \u03bcp (L)\nb of G(L(p)/\nb\nb is infinite. Therefore,\nreplaced by the one that the rank rp (L)\nL)\nb is a p-quasilocal nonwe restrict our considerations to the case where K\nb\nreal field, \u03bcp (K) 6= {1} and v(K)/pv(K) is a nontrivial finite group.

Let (K, v) be a Henselian field with K\nb < \u221e,\nditions of Proposition 5.5, for some p \u2208 P. Assume also that rp (K)\n\u03c4\n(p)\nv(K) 6= pv(K) and v(K)/pv(K) is finite of order p . Then:\nb has Galois extensions Un , U \u2032 in E(p), n \u2208 N, such that [Un : E] =\n(a) K\nn\np, [U1 . . .

It is therefore clear from (5.4) (a) that if p Br(K)\nb\nb is infinite, as required.\nis finite, then p D(K(p)/\nK)\n(b): It follows from Corollary 5.6 (a) and Galois theory that, for each\nfinite abelian p-group G, there exists a Galois extension UG of K in Kur\nwith G(UG /K) \u223c\n= G. When the rank of G is \u2264 \u03c4 (p), one obtains from\n17\n\n\f[38], Theorem 1 (or [21], Example 4.3), that there is a nicely semi-ramified\n(abbr, NSR) algebra NG \u2208 d(K), in the sense of [21], possessing a maximal\nsubfield K-isomorphic to UG ; this ensures that ind(NG ) and exp(NG ) equal\nthe order and the period of G, respectively. Thus it becomes clear that\nthere exist Nk,n \u2208 d(K) : k, n \u2208 N, n \u2264 k \u2264 \u03c4 (p)n, such that Nk,n /K is\nNSR, ind(Nk,n ) = pk and exp(Nk,n ) = pn . This proves Corollary 5.6 (b),\nb implies \u03c4 (p) = Brdp (K). \u0003\nsince by [15], Theorem 4.1, the infinity of rp (K)\nOur next result supplements Corollary 5.6 as follows:\nCorollary 5.7.

[45], Ch. 3, Theorem 2), one obtains that there is\nTH \u2208 d(K) with the following properties: TH /K is totally ramified, v(TH ) \u2282\nv(NG )\u2032 and v(TH )/v(K) is isomorphic to H \u2295 H; v(NG ) \u2229 v(TH ) = v(K)\nand TH \u2297K Kur \u2208 d(Kur ); TH is a tensor product of r(H) cyclic totally\nramified K-algebras; ind(TH ) and exp(TH ) equal the order and the period\nof H/v(K), respectively (see, e.g., [21], for more details). Note also that,\nby [38], Theorem 1, NG \u2297K TG \u2208 d(K). These observations indicate that,\nfor any n \u2208 N, there exist \u2206n \u2208 d(K) and Tn,\u03c1 \u2208 d(K) : \u03c1 = 1, . . . n\u03b8, where\nb\n\u03b8 = [(\u03c4 (p) \u2212 mp (K))/2],\nsatisfying the following conditions:\n(5.6) (a) \u2206n /K is NSR, exp(\u2206n ) = pn and ind(\u2206n ) = pn.m\u0304 ;\n(b) For each index \u03c1, Tn,\u03c1 /K is totally ramified, \u2206n \u2297K Tn,\u03c1 \u2208 d(K),\nexp(\u2206n \u2297K Tn,\u03c1 ) = pn , and ind(Tn,\u03c1 ) = p\u03c1 .\n18\n\n\fStatements (5.6) (b) show that ind(\u2206n \u2297K Tn,\u03c1 ) = pn+\u03c1 , \u03c1 = 1, . . . , \u03b8, which\ncompletes the proof of Corollary 5.7.\n\u0003\nSumming-up Corollaries 5.6, 5.7 and [15], Lemma 5.1, and combining the\nlatter with Corollary 5.3, one one fully describes p-primary index-exponent\nb is\nK-pairs, for a Henselian field (K, v), such that v(K) 6= pv(K) and K\nb\nnonreal and p-quasilocal with \u03bcp (K) 6= {1}. We refer the reader to [15],\nCorollary 2.2 and Remark 4.2, for an analogous description in the case where\nb is formally real 2-quasilocal.\n(K, v) is Henselian, p = 2, and K\n6. Preparation for the proof of Theorems 3.2 and 1.3\nLet E be a field, M \u2208 \u03a9(E), \u03a0 the set of prime divisors of [M : E], and\nMp = M \u2229 E(p), for each p \u2208 \u03a0. When M 6= E, the homomorphism\ngroup\nQ\nHom(E \u2217 , G(M/E)) is isomorphic to the direct group product p\u2208\u03a0 Hom(E \u2217 ,\nG(Mp /E)), so Theorem 1.3 can be deduced from Theorem 3.2, Lemma 2.1\nand the primary tensor decomposition of cyclic E-algebras (cf. [41], Sect.\n15.3). The results of this Section serve as a basis for the proof of Theorem\n3.2, presented in Section 7. Our starting point are the following two lemmas.\nLemma 6.1. Let E and M be fields, such that M \u2208 \u03a9p (E), for some\np \u2208 P (E). Suppose that G(M/E) has rank t \u2265 1 as a p-group, and F is\nan intermediate field of M/E of degree [F : E] = p. Then there exist cyclic\nQ\nextensions E1 , . . . , Et of E in M with E1 . . . Et = M , ti=1 [Ei : E] = [M : E]\nQ\nand ti=1 [(F Ei ) : F ] = [M : F ].\nProof. In view of Galois theory, this is equivalent to the following statement:\n(6.1) Let G be a finite abelian p-group of rank t \u2265 1 and H a maximal\nsubgroup of G. Then these exist cyclic subgroups G1 , . . . , Gt of G, such that\nthe (inner) products of Gi : i = 1, . . . , t, and H \u2229 Gi : i = 1, . . . , t, are direct\nand equal to G and H, respectively.\nTo prove (6.1) take a cyclic subgroup G1 \u2264 G of maximal order so that\nthe order of the group H1 = H \u2229 G1 equals the exponent of H. The choice of\nG1 ensures that G1 G0 = G whenever G0 is maximal among the subgroups\nof G, which trivially intersect G1 (cf. [19], Sects. 15 and 27). This implies\nthe existence of subgroups H1\u2032 \u2264 H and G\u20321 \u2264 G, such that H1 \u2229 H1\u2032 =\nG1 \u2229 G\u20321 = {1}, H1\u2032 \u2264 G\u20321 and the products H1 H1\u2032 and G1 G\u20321 are equal to H\nand G, respectively. Therefore, (6.1) can be proved by induction on t. \u0003\nLemma 6.2. Assume that E, M , p and t satisfy the conditions of Lemma\n6.1, and let F be a maximal subfield of M including\nQ E. Then there exist\ncyclic extensions E1 , . . . , Et of E in M , such that ti=1 [Ei : E] = [M : E],\nQt\ni=1 [(Ei \u2229 F ) : E] = [F : E], and the compositums E1 . . . Et and (Ei \u2229\nF ) . . . (Et \u2229 F ) are equal to M and F , respectively.\nProof. This is equivalent to the following statement:\n(6.2) Let G be a finite abelian p-group of rank t \u2265 1, H a subgroup of G of\norder p, and \u03c0 the natural homomorphism of G on G/H. Then G contains\n19\n\n\felements g1 , . . . , gt , for which the products of the cyclic groups hg1 i, . . . , hgt i\nand h\u03c0(g1 )i, . . . , h\u03c0(gt )i are direct and equal to G and G/H, respectively.\n\nFor the proof of (6.2), consider a cyclic subgroup C1 \u2264 G of maximal\norder, and such that C1 \u2229 H is of minimal possible order. Then one can find\nC1\u2032 \u2264 G so that C1 \u2229 C1\u2032 = {1}, C1 C1\u2032 = G and H \u2282 C1 \u222a C1\u2032 . This implies\nG/H is isomorphic to the direct product C1 H/H \u00d7 C1\u2032 H/H, which allows\none to prove (6.2) by induction on t.\n\u0003\nLet now G be a finite abelian p-group of rank t \u2265 2. A subset g =\n{g1 , . . . , gt } of G is called an ordered basis of G, if g is a basis of G (i.e.\nthe group product hg1 i . . . hgt i is direct and equal to G) and the orders of\nthe elements of g satisfy the inequalities o(g1 ) \u2265 * * * \u2265 o(gt ). It is known\nthat the automorphism group Aut(G) acts transitively on the set Ob(G) of\nordered bases of G. Arguing by induction on t, and using the fact that cyclic\nsubgroups of G of order o(g1 ) are direct summands in G (see [19], Sect. 27),\none obtains that Aut(G) has the following system of generators:\n(6.3) Aut(G) = hd(k, m; h), t(i, j, s; h) : h \u2208 Ob(G)i, where i, j, k, s and\nm are integers with 1 \u2264 k, i, j \u2264 t, i 6= j, 1 < m < o(hk ), 1 \u2264 s < o(hi ),\ngcd (m, o(hk )) = 1 and max{1, o(hi )/o(hj )} | s, and d(k, m; h), t(i, j, s; h)\n\u2032\nare defined by the data d(k, m; h)(hk ) = hm\nk , d(k, m; h)(hk \u2032 ) = hk \u2032 : k 6= k,\n\u2032\ns\nand t(i, j, s; h)(hj ) = hj hi , t(i, j, s; h) (hj \u2032 ) = hj \u2032 : j 6= j.\nThis allows us to prove the following two lemmas without serious technical\ndifficulties.\n\nLemma 6.3. Let E, M , p and t satisfy the conditions of Lemma 6.1, and let\nE be a p-quasilocal field. Suppose that B a cyclic subgroup of Br(E)p of order o(B) divisible by [M : E], b is a generator of B and B(M/E) is the group\nof those \u03b2 \u2208 E \u2217 , for which [(L/E, \u03c4, \u03b2)] \u2208 B whenever L/E is a cyclic extension, L \u2286 M and h\u03c4 i = G(L/E). Assume also that E1 , . . . , Et are cyclic\nQ\nextensions of E in M , such that E1 . . . Et = M and [M : E] = tj=1 [Ej : E],\nand for each index j \u2264 t, let Ej\u2032 be the compositum of the fields Ei : i 6= j, \u03c4j\na generator of G(Ej /E), and \u03c3j the unique Ej\u2032 -automorphism of M extending\n\u03c4j . Then there exist a group homomorphism \u03c9M/E,b : B(M/E) \u2192 G(M/E),\nand elements c1 , . . . , ct of E \u2217 with the following properties:\n(i) cj \u2208 N (Ej\u2032 /E) and [(Ej /E, \u03c4j , cj )] = [o(B)/[Ej : E]].b, for each index\nj; the co-set cj N (M/E) is uniquely determined by b and \u03c4j ;\n(ii) \u03c9M/E,b is the unique homomorphism of B(M/E) on G(M/E) mapping\ncj into \u03c3j : j = 1, . . . , t, and with a kernel equal to N (M/E);\n(iii) \u03c9M/E,b does not depend on the choice of the t-tuples (E1 , . . . , Et ) and\n(\u03c41 , . . . , \u03c4t ); it induces a group isomorphism B(M/E)/N (M/E) \u223c\n= G(M/E).\nProof. If t = 1, our assertions can be deduced from Theorem 3.1 and the\ngeneral theory of cyclic algebras (see [41], Sect. 15.1). Henceforth, we\nassume that t \u2265 2. Using consecutively Galois theory and Theorem 3.1,\none obtains that N (Ej /E)N (Ej\u2032 /E) = E \u2217 : j = 1, . . . , t, which implies\nthe existence of elements c1 , . . . , ct of E \u2217 with the properties required by\nLemma 6.3 (i). Denote by T (M/E) the subgroup of E \u2217 generated by\n20\n\n\fthe set N (M/E) \u222a {c1 , . . . , ct }. It is easily verified that \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3t and\nc1 N (M/E), . . . , ct N (M/E) form bases of the groups G(M/E) and T (M/E)/\nN (M/E), respectively. Therefore, there exists a unique homomorphism\n\u03c9M/E,b of T (M/E) on G(M/E), such that \u03c9M/E,b (cj ) = \u03c3j : j = 1, . . . , t,\nand Ker(\u03c9M/E,b ) = N (M/E). The mapping \u03c9M/E,b is surjective, so it induces canonically an isomorphism of T (M/E)/N (M/E) on G(M/E). We\naim at proving that T (M/E) = B(M/E). Assuming that [M : E] = pm ,\nand proceeding by induction on m, one obtains that this can be deduced\nfrom Lemma 6.2 and [41], Sect. 15.1, Corollary b, if \u03c9M/E,b has the property claimed by the former part of Lemma 6.3 (iii). In order to establish this property (the crucial point in our proof), consider another basis \u03c31\u2032 , . . . , \u03c3t\u2032 of G(M/E), and for each j \u2208 {1, . . . , t}, let Hj be the subgroup of G(M/E) generated by the elements \u03c3i\u2032 : i 6= j, Fj the fixed field\nof Hj , \u03c4j\u2032 the E-automorphism of Fj induced by \u03c3j\u2032 , and Fj\u2032 the compositum\n,\nQt of all Fi with i 6= j. It follows from Galois theory that F1 .\u2032 . . Ft = M\n\u2032 is\n[F\n:\nE]\n=\n[M\n:\nE],\nF\n/E\nis\na\ncyclic\nextension,\nG(F\n/E)\n=\nh\u03c4\ni,\nand\n\u03c3\nj\nj\nj\nj\ni=1 i\nthe unique Fj\u2032 -automorphism of M extending \u03c4j\u2032 (j = 1, . . . , t). Since \u03c9M/E,b\nis surjective, it maps some elements c\u20321 , . . . , c\u2032t of T (M/E) into \u03c31\u2032 , . . . , \u03c3t\u2032 ,\nrespectively. Applying Lemma 6.2 and [41], Sect. 15.1, Corollary b, one\nconcludes that the proof of Lemma 6.3 will be complete, if we show that\nc\u2032j \u2208 N (Fj\u2032 /E) and [(Fj /E, \u03c4j\u2032 , c\u2032j )] = [o(B)/[Fj : E]].b, for every index j.\nIt is clearly sufficient to consider the special case in which {\u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3t } and\n{\u03c31\u2032 , . . . , \u03c3t\u2032 } are ordered bases of G(M/E) (which implies [E\u03c1 : E] = [F\u03c1 : E],\n\u03c1 = 1, . . . , t). In view of [41], Sect. 15.1, Corollary a, and (6.3), one\nmay assume in addition that \u03c3j\u2032 = \u03c3j \u03c3is , c\u2032j = cj csi , \u03c3u\u2032 = \u03c3u and c\u2032u =\ncu : u 6= j, for some pair (i, j) of different indices, and some integer s satisfying the inequalities 1 \u2264 s < o(\u03c3i ) and divisible by max{1, o(\u03c3i )/o(\u03c3j )}.\nThen it follows from Galois theory that Fi Fj = Ei Ej , Fw = Ew , \u03c4w\u2032 =\n\u03c4w : w 6= i, and Fu\u2032 = Eu\u2032 : u 6= j. One also sees that if t \u2265 3 and\ny \u2208 ({1, . . . , t} \\ {i, j}), then c\u2032j \u2208 N (Ey /E). Since the cyclic E-algebras\n(Ej /E, \u03c4j , cj ) and (Ej /E, \u03c4j , c\u2032j ) are isomorphic (see [41], Sect. 15.1, Proposition b), and by Lemma 4.1, N (Fj\u2032 /E) = \u2229u6=j N (Fu /E), this reduces the\nproof of Lemma 6.3 (ii) to the one of the assertions that c\u2032j \u2208 N (Fi /E) and\nthere is an E-isomorphism (Ei /E, \u03c4i , ci ) \u223c\n= (Fi /E, \u03c4i\u2032 , ci ). We first show that\n\u2032\n\u223c\n(Ei /E, \u03c4i , ci ) = (Fi /E, \u03c4i , ci ). The assumptions on Ei , Fi and Ej = Fj guarantee that the field Ei Ej = Fi Ej is isomorphic as an E-algebra to Ei \u2297E Ej\nand Fi \u2297E Ej (cf. [41], Sect. 14.7, Lemma b). It is therefore easy to see from\nthe general properties of tensor products (cf. [41], Sect. 9.2, Proposition c)\n\u2032\nthat (Ei /E, \u03c4i , ci ) \u2297E (Ej /E, \u03c4j , cj ) \u223c\n= (Fi /E, \u03c4i\u2032 , ci ) \u2297E (Ej /E, \u03c4j , cj csi ) as\nE-algebras, where s\u2032 = s.[o(\u03c3j )/o(\u03c3i )]. Since s\u2032 \u2208 Z and ci \u2208 N (Ej /E),\n\u2032\nthere exists an E-isomorphism (Ej /E, \u03c4j , cj ) \u223c\n= (Ej /E, \u03c4j , cj csi ). The obtained results prove that (Ei /E, \u03c4i , ci ) and (Fi /E, \u03c4i\u2032 , ci ) are similar over E.\nAs [Ei : E] = [Fi : E], we also have [(Ei /E, \u03c4i , ci ) : E] = [(Fi /E, \u03c4i\u2032 , ci ) : E]\n= [Ei : E]2 , so it turns out that (Ei /E, \u03c4i , ci ) \u223c\n= (Fi /E, \u03c4i\u2032 , ci ), as claimed.\nIt remains to be seen that c\u2032j \u2208 N (Fi /E). Suppose first that Fi \u2229 Ei = E,\ntake elements \u03b2i \u2208 Ej , \u03b2j \u2208 Ei , \u03b4 \u2208 Br(E) and an algebra D \u2208 d(E) so\nE\nthat NE j (\u03b2i ) = ci , NEEi (\u03b2j ) = cj , ([Ei : E].[Ej : E])\u03b4 = b, and o(B)\u03b4 = [D],\n21\n\n\fand denote by \u03c6i and \u03c6j the automorphisms of Ei Ej induced by \u03c3i and\n\u03c3j , respectively. It is easily verified that [Ej : E].[D] = [(Ei /E, \u03c4i , ci )] and\nG(Ei Ej /Ej ) = h\u03c6i i. This, combined with the fact that Ei Ej = Fi Ej , Ei \u2229\nEj = E and \u03c6i extends \u03c4i , enables one to deduce from (4.1) (iii), Proposition\n2.2 and the RC-formula that D \u2297E Ej is similar to the cyclic Ej -algebra\n(Ei Ej /Ej , \u03c6i , \u03b2i ). Since [Ei : E].[D] = [(Ej /E, \u03c4j , cj )], G(Ei Ej /Ei ) = h\u03c6j i,\nand \u03c6j is a prolongation of \u03c4j , it is analogously proved that [D \u2297E Ei ] =\n[(Ei Ej /Ei , \u03c6j , \u03b2j )] in Br(Ei ). At the same time, it is clear from Galois theory\nand the condition Fi \u2229 Ei = E that G(Ei Ej /E) = h\u03c6j , \u03c6si i (i.e. g.c.d.(s, p) =\n1), [Ei : E] \u2264 [Ej : E], and Ei Fi = Ei \u03a6, where \u03a6 is the extension of E in Ej\nof degree [\u03a6 : E] = [Ei : E]. Note also that \u03c6j extends \u03c4i\u2032\u2212s , since \u03c3j\u2032 (\u03bb) = \u03bb,\nfor every \u03bb \u2208 Fi . Observing now that [(Ei /E, \u03c4i , ci )] = \u03c9.[(Ej /E, \u03c4j , cj )] and\n[(Ei Fi /Ei , \u03c8j , \u03b2j )] = \u03c9.[(Ei Ej /Ei , \u03c6j , \u03b2j )], where \u03c9 = [Ej : E]/[Ei : E] =\n[Ei Ej : Ei Fi ] and \u03c8j is the automorphism of Ei Fi induced by \u03c6j (cf. [41],\nSect. 15.1, Corollary b), one obtains from (4.1) (iii) that (Ei /E, \u03c4i , ci ) \u223c\n=\n(\u03a6/E, \u03c8\u0304j , cj ) \u223c\n= (Fi /E, \u03c4i\u2032\u2212s , cj ) over E (\u03c8\u0304j being the automorphism of \u03a6\ninduced by \u03c6j ). Since (Ei /E, \u03c4i , ci ) \u223c\n= (Fi /E, \u03c4i\u2032 , ci ), these results indicate\n\u2032\nthat (Fi /E, \u03c4i\u2032\u2212s , cj ) \u223c\n= (Fi /E, \u03c4i\u2032\u2212s , c\u2212s\ni ), which means that cj \u2208 N (Fi /E).\ne [E\ne : E] = \u03bc > 1, s/\u03bc = s\u0303 and Ei Ej = Ei,j . Then\nLet now Ei \u2229 Fi = E,\ne and G(Ei,j /E)\ne = G(Ei,j /Ei )G(Ei,j /Fi ), which implies s\u0303 \u2208 Z and\nEi,j \u2208 \u03a9(E)\nE\u2032\ng.c.d.(s\u0303, p) = 1. For each index u 6= i, take \u03b3u \u2208 Eu\u2032 so that NE u (\u03b3u ) = cu ,\nE\u2032\neu = Eu E\ne and Feu = Fu E.\ne Since Ei \u2229 Eu = E, it\nand put c\u0303u = N e u (\u03b3u ), E\nE\ne [E\neu : E]\ne = [Eu : E], \u03c4u uniquely\nfollows from (4.1) (ii) that Ei \u2229 \u1ebcu = E,\ne\neu , and G(E\neu /E)\ne = h\u03c4\u0303u i. Note also that\nextends to a E-automorphism\n\u03c4\u0303u of E\ne\neu /E).\ne Fix elements b\u03bc \u2208\nN Eu (\u03b8u ) = N Eu (\u03b8u ), \u03b8u \u2208 Eu , whence ci \u2208 N (E\nE\n\ne\nE\n\nBr(E) and \u2206u \u2208 d(E) so that \u03bc.b\u03bc = b and [\u2206u ] = [o(B)/[Eu : E]]b\u03bc , and put\nb\u2032 = \u03c1E/Ee (b\u03bc ). It is clear from the double centralizer theorem (cf. [41], Sects.\ne Applye = [(Ei /E,\ne \u03c4 \u03bc , ci )] in Br(E).\n12.7 and 13.3) that [(Ei /E, \u03c4i , ci ) \u2297E E]\ni\ning Proposition 2.2, (4.1) (iii) and the RC-formula, one obtains consecutively\ne [(Ei /E, \u03c4i , ci )] = [o(B)/[Ei : E]]b\ne \u03bc,\nthat o(B) equals the order of b\u2032 in Br(E),\n\u03bc\ne \u03c4 , ci )] = [o(B)/[Ei : E]].b\ne \u2032 , and for each u 6= i, [(Eu /E, \u03c4u , cu )] =\n[(Ei /E,\ni\neu /E,\ne \u03c4\u0303u , c\u0303u )] = [\u2206u \u2297E E]\ne = [o(B)/[E\neu : E]].b\ne \u2032 . Consider now\n\u03bc[\u2206u ] and [(E\ne s\u0303, b\u2032 , the fields Ei , Fi , E\neu , Feu : u 6= i, and the algebras (Ei /E,\ne \u03c4 \u03bc , ci ),\nM/E,\ni\n\u2032\u03bc\nej /E,\ne \u03c4\u0303j , c\u0303j ), instead of M/E, s, b, Eu\u2032 , Fu\u2032 : u\u2032 = 1, . . . , t,\ne \u03c4 , ci ), (E\n(Fi /E,\ni\nand (Ei /E, \u03c4i , ci ), (Fi /E, \u03c4i\u2032 , ci ), (Ej /E, \u03c4j , cj ), respectively. As in the proof\ne\nof our assertion in case g.c.d.(s, p) = 1, one concludes that c\u0303j cs\u0303i \u2208 N (Fi /E).\ne\nSince NEE (c\u0303j cs\u0303i ) = c\u2032j , this yields c\u2032j \u2208 N (Fi /E) (and T (M/E) = B(M/E)),\nwhich completes the proof of Lemma 6.3.\n\u0003\n\nLemma 6.4. In the setting of Lemma 6.3, let F be an extension of E in M ,\n\u03c0M/F the natural projection of G(M/E) on G(F/E), \u03c1E/F (b) = b\u2032 , B \u2032 = hb\u2032 i,\nand B\u03ba = hb\u03ba i, where b\u03ba = \u03ba.b, for some \u03ba \u2208 N dividing o(B)/[M : E]. Then\n[M : E] | o(B\u03ba ), [M : F ] | o(B \u2032 ), and the mappings \u03c9M/E,b , \u03c9M/E,b\u03ba , \u03c9F/E,b\nand \u03c9M/F,b\u2032 , determined as required by Lemma 6.3, are related as follows:\n(i) \u03c9M/E,b = \u03c9M/E,b\u03ba and \u03c9F/E,b = \u03c0M/F \u25e6 \u03c9M/E,b ;\n22\n\n\f(ii) \u03c9M/F,b\u2032 (\u03b3) = \u03c9M/E,b (NEF (\u03b3)), for every \u03b3 \u2208 F \u2217 .\nProof. Clearly, o(B\u03ba ) = o(B)/\u03ba, and Proposition 2.2 implies that o(B \u2032 ) =\no(B)/[F : E], so the assertions that [M : E] | o(B\u03ba ), [M : F ] | o(B \u2032 ) and\n\u03c9M/E,b = \u03c9M/E,b\u03ba are obvious. Note also that if t = 1, then the remaining\nstatements of the lemma can be deduced from the general properties of\ncyclic algebras. Suppose further that t \u2265 2. First we prove that \u03c9F/E,b =\n\u03c0M/F \u25e6 \u03c9M/E,b in case F is a maximal subfield of M . Let E1 , . . . , Et be\nextensions of E in M with the properties described by Lemma 6.2. Then\nthere exists an index j, such that Ej \u2229 F is a maximal subfield of Ej and\nEi \u2286 F , for any other index i. This allows us to prove our assertion by\napplying Lemma 6.3 and [41], Sect. 15.1, Corollary b.\nWe turn to the proof of Lemma 6.4 (ii) in the special case of [F : E] = p.\nIt is briefly presented, since we argue along the same lines as the concluding\npart of the proof of Lemma 6.3. Take E1 , E1\u2032 , . . . , Et , Et\u2032 , \u03c41 , \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c4t , \u03c3t\nand c1 , . . . , ct in accordance with Lemmas 6.1 and 6.3. Then F \u2286 Ej and\nEu \u2229 F = E : u 6= j, for some index j. This implies F \u2286 Eu\u2032 and \u03c4u uniquely\nextends to an F -automorphism \u03c4\u0303u of the field Eu F := \u1ebcu , when u runs across\nthe set Wj = {1, . . . , t} \\ {j}. Choose elements \u03b11 \u2208 E1\u2032 , . . . , \u03b1t \u2208 Et\u2032 so that\nE\u2032\n\nNE k (\u03b1k ) = ck : k = 1, . . . , t, and put \u1ebcj = Ej , c\u0303j = cj , \u03c4\u0303j = \u03c4jp , \u03c3\u0303j = \u03c3jp ,\nE\u2032\n\nand c\u0303u = NF u (\u03b1u ), \u03c3\u0303u = \u03c3u : u \u2208 Wj . It is easily verified that NEF (c\u0303j ) = cpj\nand NEF (c\u0303u ) = cu , u \u2208 Wj . Therefore, it follows from (4.1) (iii), [41], Sect.\n14.7, Lemma a, and the equality o(B \u2032 ) = o(B)/p that M/F , b\u2032 , and \u1ebc\u03c1 ,\n\u03c4\u0303\u03c1 , \u03c3\u0303\u03c1 , c\u0303\u03c1 , where \u03c1 runs through Wj or {1, . . . , t} depending on whether or\nnot F = Ej , are related as in Lemma 6.3. Since the RC-formula and [41],\nSect. 15.1, Proposition b, yield CorF/E ([(Ej /F, \u03c4jp , cj )]) = [(Ej /E, \u03c4j , cpj )],\nthis proves Lemma 6.4 (ii) when [F : E] = p.\nLet finally F be any proper extension of E in M different from M . By Galois theory and the structure of finite abelian groups, then M possesses subfields F0 and M0 , such that E \u2282 F0 \u2286 F \u2286 M0 and [F0 : E] = [M : M0 ] = p.\nIn view of the transitivity of norm mappings, canonical projections of Galois\ngroups and scalar extension maps of Brauer groups in towers of intermediate\nfields of M/E (cf. [41], Sect. 9.4, Corollary a), the considered special cases\nof Lemma 6.4 enable one to complete inductively its proof.\n\u0003\n7. Existence and form of Hasse symbols\nThe main purpose of this Section is to prove Theorem 3.2. Fix an Fp -basis\nIp of p Br(E) and a generator \u03c6\u221e of G(E\u221e /E) as a topological group.

By Proposition 2.2 and [41], Sect. 15.1, Proposition a, E \u2032\u2217 has a subset Cp (E \u2032 ) = {ci,n (E \u2032 ) : i \u2208 Ip , n \u2208 N}, such that\n[((\u0393n E \u2032 )/E \u2032 , \u03c6n (E \u2032 ), ci,n (E \u2032 ))] = bi,n (E \u2032 ), for each (i, n) \u2208 Ip \u00d7 N. Observe that, for any n \u2208 N, there is a unique surjective homomorphism\n( , (\u0393n E \u2032 )/E \u2032 ) : E \u2032\u2217 \u2192 G(\u0393n E \u2032 /E \u2032 )d(p) , whose kernel is N (\u0393n E \u2032 /E \u2032 ), and\nwhich maps ci,n (E \u2032 ) into gi,n (E \u2032 ), when i \u2208 Ip . Fix some M \u2032 \u2208 \u03a9p (E \u2032 )\nand \u03bc \u2208 Z so that p\u03bc \u2265 [M \u2032 : E], and for each i \u2208 Ip , let B(M \u2032 /E \u2032 )i =\n{\u03b2i \u2208 E \u2032\u2217 : [(L\u2032 /E \u2032 , \u03c3 \u2032 , \u03b2i )] \u2208 hbi,\u03bc (E \u2032 )i}, for every cyclic extension L\u2032 of\nE \u2032 in M \u2032 , where \u03c3 \u2032 is a generator of G(L\u2032 /E \u2032 ). It follows from Proposition 2.2 (ii)-(iii), the definition of \u039bp (E) and Lemma 6.3 that the groups\nB(M \u2032 /E \u2032 )i := B(M \u2032 /E \u2032 )i /N (M \u2032 /E \u2032 ), i \u2208 Ip , have the following property:\n\n\u223c G(M \u2032 /E \u2032 ), for each index i, and the inner product of\n(7.1) B(M \u2032 /E \u2032 ) =\nB(M \u2032 /E \u2032 )i : i \u2208 Ip , is direct and coincides with E \u2032\u2217 /N (M \u2032 /E \u2032 ).\n\nTherefore, there exists a unique homomorphism ( , M \u2032 /E \u2032 ) of E \u2032\u2217 into\nG(M \u2032 /E \u2032 )d(p) , mapping B(M \u2032 /E \u2032 )i into the i-th component of G(M \u2032 /E \u2032 )d(p)\nby the formula \u03b2i \u2192 \u03c9M \u2032 /E \u2032 ,bi,\u03bc (E \u2032 ) (\u03b2i ), for each i \u2208 Ip , where \u03c9M \u2032 /E \u2032 ,bi,\u03bc (E \u2032 )\nis defined as in Lemma 6.3. Hence, Ker( , M \u2032 /E \u2032 ) = N (M \u2032 /E \u2032 ), and by\nLemma 6.4, the sets H(E \u2032 ) = {( , M \u2032 /E \u2032 ) : M \u2032 \u2208 \u03a9p (E \u2032 )}, E \u2032 \u2208 \u03a9p (E),\nconsist of surjections related as required by Theorem 3.2 (ii)\u00f7(iii).\nSuppose now that \u0398p (E \u2032 ) = {\u03b8(M \u2032 /E \u2032 ) : E \u2032\u2217 \u2192 G(M \u2032 /E \u2032 )d(p) , M \u2032 \u2208\n\u03a9p (E \u2032 )}, E \u2032 \u2208 \u03a9p (E), is a system of surjective homomorphisms with the\nsame kernels and relations, and such that \u03b8(\u0393n /E) = ( , \u0393n /E), for every\nn \u2208 N. Then it follows from Proposition 2.2, the RC-formula and (4.1)\n(iii) that \u03b8(\u0393n E \u2032 /E \u2032 ) = ( , (\u0393n E \u2032 )/E \u2032 ), for each pair (E \u2032 , n) \u2208 \u03a9p (E) \u00d7 N.\nWe show that \u0398p (E \u2032 ) = Hp (E \u2032 ), for any E \u2032 \u2208 \u03a9p (E). This is obvious, if\nE\u221e = E(p), so we assume further that E(p) 6= E\u221e . In view of Proposition\n2.2 (i) and the already established part of Theorem 3.2, it is sufficient to\nprove that \u03b8(M/E) = ( , M/E), for an arbitrary fixed field M \u2208 \u03a9p (E).\nNote first that the compositum M E\u221e possesses a subfield M0 \u2208 \u03a9p (E),\nsuch that M0 \u2229 E\u221e = E and M0 E\u221e = M E\u221e . This follows from Galois\ntheory and the projectivity of Zp as a profinite group (cf. [48], Ch. I, 5.9).\nIn particular, M \u2286 M0 \u0393n , for every sufficiently large index n. We also have\n\u03b8(M/E) = \u03c0M0 \u0393n /M \u25e6 \u03b8(M0 \u0393n /E), which allows us to consider only the special case of M = M0 \u0393\u03ba and M0 6= E, where \u03ba is chosen so that [M0 : E] | p\u03ba .\nLet now t be theQrank of G(M/E), and E1 , . . . , Et be cyclic extensions of E\nin M , such that tu=1 [Eu : E] = [M : E], E1 = \u0393\u03ba and E2 . . . Et = M0 . Take\nE1\u2032 , . . . , Et\u2032 as in Lemma 6.3, denote for convenience by \u03c41 the automorphism\n\u03c6\u03ba (E) of E1 , and let \u03c4u be a generator of G(Eu /E), for every u \u2208 {2, . . . , t}.\nFix an index x \u2208 Ip , put bx,\u03ba (p) = bx , and identifying G(M/E) with the x-th\ncomponent of G(M/E)d(p) , consider elements x1 , . . . , xt of E \u2217 determined so\nthat \u03b8(M/E)(xu ) equals the Eu\u2032 -automorphism \u03c3u of M extending \u03c4u , for\neach positive integer u \u2264 t. The assumptions on \u0398p (E \u2032 ) : E \u2032 \u2208 \u03a9p (E), imply\nthat xu \u2208 N (Eu\u2032 /E) : u = 1, . . . , t, and [(E1 /E, \u03c41 , x1 )] = bx . We show as\nin the proof of Lemma 6.3 (iii) that [(Eu /E, \u03c4u , xu )] = (p\u03ba /[Eu : E])bx , for\n24\n\n\feach u. Fix an index u \u2265 2, put \u03c9u = p\u03ba /[Eu : E], \u03c31\u2032 = \u03c31 \u03c3u , x\u20321 = x1 xu ,\nand denote by Fu the fixed field of the subgroup of G(M/E) generated\n/ {1, u}. It is easily verified that F1 . . . Ft = M and\nby \u03c31\u2032 and \u03c3u\u2032 : u\u2032 \u2208\nQt\n\u2032\n:\nE]\n=\n[M\n: E], where Fu\u2032 = Eu\u2032 : u\u2032 6= u. As Ker(\u03b8(Fu /E)) =\n[F\n\u2032\nu =1 u\nN (Fu /E), \u03b8(M/E)(x\u20321 ) = \u03c31\u2032 and \u03c31\u2032 \u2208 G(M/Fu ), the equality \u03b8(F/E) =\n\u03c0M/E \u25e6 \u03b8(M/E) ensures that x\u20321 \u2208 N (Fu /E). Observe also that E1 Eu =\nE1 Fu and Eu \u2229Fu = E. This implies that (E1 /E, \u03c41 , x1 )\u2297E (Eu /E, \u03c4u , xu ) is\nE-isomorphic to (E1 /E, \u03c41\u2032 , x1 x\u03c9u u ) \u2297E (Fu /E, fu , xu ), where \u03c41\u2032 \u2208 G(E1 /E)\nand fu \u2208 G(Fu /E) are induced by \u03c31\u2032 and \u03c3u , respectively. Since \u03c3u \u2208\nG(M/E1 ) and xu \u2208 N (E1 /E), it thereby turns out that (Eu /E, \u03c4u , xu ) \u223c\n=\n(Fu /E, fu , xu ) \u223c\n= (Fu /E, fu\u22121 , x1 ) \u223c\n= (Fu /E, f1 , x1 ) over E, f1 being the automorphism of Fu induced by \u03c31 . Furthermore, if \u03a6u is the extension of E\nin E1 of degree [Eu : E], then Eu \u03a6u = Eu Fu and, because x1 \u2208 N (Eu /E), it\nfollows that [(Eu /E, \u03c4u , xu )] = [(Fu /E, f1 , x1 )] = \u03c9u [(E1 /E, \u03c41 , x1 )] = \u03c9u bx ,\nas claimed. The obtained result indicates that \u03b8(M/E)(\u03b1x ) = (\u03b1x , M/E),\nfor each \u03b1x \u2208 B(M/E)x . As x is an arbitrary element of Ip , this enables\none to complete the proof of Theorem 3.2 by applying (7.1).\nRemark 7.1. Theorem 1.1 and [7], Theorem 2.1, show that if (E, v) is a\nb\nb is a Zp -extension,\nHenselian discrete valued strictly PQL-field, then E(p)/\nE\nfor each p \u2208 P (E). Therefore, one can take as E\u221e the compositum of all\nI \u2208 \u03a9(E) that are inertial over E. Note also that if E is SQL, then Br(E)\nis isomorphic to the direct sum \u2295p\u2208P (E) Z(p\u221e ) (by (2.1) (i)), and for each\np \u2208 P (E), the set \u039bp (E) can be chosen so that one may put Cp (E) =\n{cn (p) = \u03c0 : n \u2208 N}, where \u03c0 is a uniformizer of (E, v). When E is a local\nfield, and for each (p, n) \u2208 P (E) \u00d7 N, \u03c6n (p) is the Frobenius automorphism\nof the inertial extension of E in Esep of degree pn , the sets Hp (E), p \u2208 P (E),\nfrom the proof of Theorem 3.2, define the Hasse (the norm residue) symbol,\nin the sense of [25], and give rise to the Artin map (cf. [20], Ch. 6).\nCorollary 7.2. In the setting of (2.2) (i), let M \u2208 \u03a9(E) and F be a finite\nextension of E in Esep . Then N (M F/F ) = {\u03bb \u2208 F \u2217 : NEF (\u03bb) \u2208 N (M/E)}.\n\nProof. It suffices to prove that N (M F/F ) includes the preimage of N (M/E)\nin F \u2217 under NEF . In view of Theorem 3.1, Lemma 2.1, [9], I, Lemma 4.2 (ii),\nand of the PQL-property of F , one may consider only the case where M/F0\nis cyclic, for F0 = M \u2229 F . Put \u03bc0 = NFF0 (\u03bc), for each \u03bc \u2208 F \u2217 . Theorem 3.2\n(iii), [9], I, Lemma 4.2 (ii), and norm transitivity in towers of intermediate\nfields of M F/E imply that if NEF (\u03bc) \u2208 N (M/E), then \u03bc0 \u2208 N (M/F0 ). At\nthe same time, it follows from Proposition 2.2 (ii), [9], I, Corollary 8.5, the\nRC-formula and the assumptions on E that CorF/F0 is injective. Therefore,\none deduces from the former part of (4.1) (iii) (in the general form pointed\nout in Remark 4.3) that \u03bc \u2208 N (M F/F ), which proves our assertion.\n\u0003\nCorollary 7.2 generalizes [20], Theorem 7.6. Applying the RC-formula,\nPropositions 2.2 (ii) and 2.3 (i), as well as Lemma 2.1, norm and corestriction\ntransitivity, and already used known relations between norms and cyclic\nalgebras, one obtains by the method of proving Theorem 3.2 the existence\nof an exact analogue to the local Hasse symbol in the following situation:\n25\n\n\fCorollary 7.3. Assume that E is a nonreal field, such that every L \u2208 \u03a9(E)\nis strictly PQL with \u03c1E/L surjective. Then the maps CorL/E : L \u2208 \u03a9(E), are\n\u2032\nbijective, and there are sets H(E \u2032 ) = {( , M \u2032 /E \u2032 ) : E \u2032\u2217 \u2192 G(M \u2032 /E \u2032 )Br(E ) ,\nM \u2032 \u2208 \u03a9(E \u2032 )}, E \u2032 \u2208 \u03a9(E), of group homomorphisms satisfying the following:\n(i) ( , M \u2032 /E \u2032 ) is surjective and its kernel equals N (M \u2032 /E \u2032 ), for each E \u2032 \u2208\n\u03a9(E), M \u2032 \u2208 \u03a9(E \u2032 );\n(ii) HE \u2032 has the properties required by Theorem 1.3 (ii), for every E \u2032 \u2208\n\u03a9(E); furthermore, if M \u2208 \u03a9(E) and K is an intermediate field of M/E,\nthen (\u03bb, M/K) = (NEK (\u03bb), M/E), for any \u03bb \u2208 K \u2217 ;\n(iii) The sets H(E \u2032 ), E \u2032 \u2208 \u03a9(E), are determined by the mappings ( , \u0393/E),\nwhen \u0393 ranges over finite extensions of E in E\u221e of primary degrees.\nCorollary 7.3 has a partial analogue for a formally real strictly PQLfield E and the sets \u03a9\u2032 (E \u2032 ) = {M \u2032 \u2208 \u03a9(E \u2032 ) : 2 \u2020 [M \u2032 : E \u2032 ]}, E \u2032 \u2208 \u03a9\u2032 (E).\nSpecifically, statements (i)\u00f7(iii) hold when every E \u2032 \u2208 \u03a9\u2032 (E) is p-quasilocal\nwith Br(E \u2032 )p included in the image of \u03c1E/E \u2032 , for each p \u2208 P \\ {2}; also, in\nthis case, CorE \u2032 /E induces isomorphisms Br(E \u2032 )p \u223c\n= Br(E)p , p > 2. This\nis proved in the same way as Corollary 7.3. On the other hand, it follows\nfrom the Artin-Schreier theory that if E \u2032 \u2208 \u03a9\u2032 (E) and E \u2032 6= E, then E \u2032 is\nformally real and the action of G(E \u2032 /E) induces [E \u2032 : E] orderings on E \u2032 .\nTherefore, E \u2032 is not 2-quasilocal, so it cannot admit LCFT.\nRemark 7.4. Under the hypotheses of Theorem 1.2, let Eab be the compositum of all M \u2208 \u03a9(E), Eab (p) = Eab \u2229 E(p), for each p \u2208 P (E), and\nN1 (E) = \u2229M \u2208\u03a9(E) N (M/E). Suppose that d(p) \u2208 N, for all p \u2208 P (E),\nand Prc (E \u2217 ) is the profinite completion of E \u2217 /N1 (E) (concerning its existence, see [24], Sect. 1.2). Using Theorems 1.1, 1.3 and Galois theory, and\narguing as in the proof of implication (iii)\u2192(i) of [24], Proposition 1.14,\n\u2217 ) is isomorphic to the topological group product\none\nQ obtains that Prc (E\nd(p)\n, and so generalizes a part of [20], Proposition 6.3.\np\u2208P (E) G(Eab (p)/E)\nNote finally that every abelian torsion group T admissible by Proposition\n2.2 (ii) is isomorphic to Br(E(T )), for some strictly PQL-field E(T ) satisfying the conditions of Corollary 7.3 or its analogue in the formally real case.\nThis follows from [13], Corollary 6.6 and (7.2) (when T is divisible - from\nRemark 2.4 as well). Hence, all forms of the local reciprocity law and Hasse\nsymbol admissible by Theorems 1.2, 1.3 and Corollary 7.3 can be realized.\nReferences\n[1] A.
