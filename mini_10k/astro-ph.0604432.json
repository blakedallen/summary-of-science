This supporting evidence\n1\n\nDepartment of Physics, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721\n\n2\n\nTheoretical Division, LANL, Los Alamos, NM 87545\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nincludes the association of long-duration GRBs with star-forming galaxies (Fruchter et al.\n2002; Vreeswijk et al. 2001) and the detection of 1998bw-like \"bumps\" found in GRB afterglows (Bloom 2003). The connection between long-duration GRBs and massive stars was\nsealed by the paired observation of SN 2003dh and GRB 030329 (Hjorth et al. 2003; Stanek\net al. 2003). This association tells us that the progenitors of long-duration GRBs are almost certainly massive stars. Both theory and observation further constrain the nature of\nthese massive star GRB progenitors. A successful GRB engine must produce beamed jets\nof relativistic matter with Lorentz factors in excess of 100 (Frail et al. 2001). To reach\nand maintain the high Lorentz factors observed in GRB ejecta, the jet must not sweep up\nmuch mass and the jet engine must be active for the entire time during which the jet pushes\nthrough the star, leading theorists to argue that the massive star must lose its hydrogen\nmantle before exploding (Woosley 1993; Zhang, Woosley, & McFadyen 2003). Such a star\nwould have been a Wolf-Rayet star before collapse and its resultant supernova explosion\nshould have matched type Ib/c supernovae. Spectral observations of SN 2003dh have confirmed that the progenitor was a Wolf-Rayet progenitor (Hjorth et al. 2003; Stanek et al.\n2003).\nWolf-Rayet stars are known to have strong winds with mass outflow rates beyond\n10 M\u2299 y\u22121 and wind velocities above 1000km s\u22121 . Stellar winds sweep out the environment surrounding the star and, depending upon the density of the ambient medium, these\nwind-blown bubbles can extend beyond 10 pc (Dwarkadas 2005). The density profile for\na free-streaming wind is simply determined by mass conservation: \u1e40wind = 4\u03c0r 2 \u1e59\u03c1(r) \u2192\n\u03c1(r) = \u1e40wind /4\u03c0r 2vwind \u221d r \u22122 where \u1e40wind is the mass loss rate of the wind (assumed to\nbe constant) and \u03c1, vwind are the density and velocity (or \u1e59) of the wind respectively. The\ndensity profile takes on a r \u22122 radial dependence when we assume a constant wind velocity.\n\u22125\n\nVery quickly, GRB fireball theorists (see Chevalier et al. 2004 for a review) realized\nthat this density profile, with its characteristic \u03c1 \u221d r \u22122 profile, would produce a different\nafterglow light curve than, for example, a constant density profile expected from alternate\nGRB models (e.g. the merger of a double neutron star system). With all of the evidence\npushing toward massive star progenitors for long-duration GRBs, we would expect to find\nthat GRB afterglows were better fit by \u03c1 \u221d r \u22122 density profiles than by constant density\nprofiles, but roughly half of all systems seem to be better fit by constant density profiles, with\ntypical densities between 0.1 and 100 cm\u22123 (Meszaros et al. 1998; Dai & Lu 1998; Chevalier\n& Li 1999; Panaitescu & Kumar 2002; Chevalier et al. 2004). The disagreement between our\npicture of massive star progenitors for GRBs and observations of the GRB afterglow remains\nan outstanding problem in our understanding of long-duration GRBs. In this paper, we will\nstudy predictions of the environments surrounding long-duration GRB progenitors in an\neffort to resolve the density-profile problem.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nA number of different approaches might resolve this particular discrepancy. On one\nextreme, one can ignore the observations, hoping that future data will show a different trend\nand negate the current results1 . On the other extreme, one can rule out the current paradigm\nfor long-duration gamma-ray bursts and search for a different, non-stellar progenitor. In\nbetween a number of options exist and we will pursue two of these: 1) our free-streaming\n\u03c1 \u221d r \u22122 profile estimate for the density in the wind-blown region is an oversimplification;\nor 2) the progenitor does not reside in its wind-blown bubble when the GRB is produced.\nWe further restrict our study to progenitors of the collapsar or collapsar-like GRB engine\n(Woosley 1993; Fryer & Woosley 1998; MacFadyen & Woosley 1999). This engine, which\ninvokes the collapse of a massive star down to a black hole and the formation of an accretion\ndisk around that black hole, only works for a small subset of massive star progenitors. We\nbelieve that by studying this small subset of progenitors, we may gain some insight into the\nenvironments surrounding GRB engines.\nThe first option, modifying the density profile in the wind-blown bubble, can be accomplished in a number of different ways and has already been studied at some level. Some\nobservations can be made to fit a wind profile if the density is decreased (Wu et al. 2003;\nDai & Wu 2003). Chevalier et al. (2004) have also, in a generic sense, studied the true\ntermination radius of the Wolf-Rayet wind. If the wind terminates at a small radius, the\nobservations are probing the constant density region beyond the termination shock, and not\nthe \u03c1 \u221d r \u22122 free-streaming wind region. In \u00a72 of this paper, we study the wind profiles of\nmassive stars designed to produce collapsars (\"massive star\" progenitor to the collapsar engine), using a combination of stellar evolution models and 1-dimensional and 3-dimensional\nwind models. The wind mass loss is time-dependent, and we study the effects of this time\ndependence. Most working collapsar models require binary interactions, and we also study\nthese binary effects.\nAlternatively, there is a collapsar progenitor scenario where, before the GRB explosion,\nthe progenitor moves out of its wind nebula: this is the helium-merger progenitor (Fryer &\nWoosley 1998; Zhang & Fryer 2001). In this progenitor, the more massive star in a binary\ncollapses to form a neutron star or black hole, providing a kick to its binary system. Not\nuntil its companion evolves off the main sequence and causes the stars to merge is a burst\nproduced. Although Fryer & Woosley (1998) already predicted that such a progenitor would\n1\n\nA number of assumptions go into the afterglow models needed to estimate the density profiles and it\ncould well be that these assumptions are incorrect. Although roughly half of all explosions are better fit\nby a wind density profile (\u03c1 \u221d r\u22122 ), constant density profiles can not be ruled out for any gamma-ray\nburst. But for Only 1 or 2 cases can a r\u22122 density profile be ruled out emphatically (Panaitescu - private\ncommunication). This observation is far from certain.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nmore likely yield a surrounding environment akin to a constant density interstellar medium\n(ISM) environment, no work to date has studied this claim in detail. In \u00a73, we show results\nof Monte Carlo calculations to study the positions of these bursts relative to the formation\nsite of their binary progenitor.\nWe ultimately find that the seeming discrepancy between simple wind models and GRB\nafterglow observations can play an important role in homing in on the true progenitor of\nthese long-duration bursts. Although we can not rule out the massive star progenitor GRB\nscenario, it is becoming increasingly difficult to match such a progenitor to observations.\nThe helium merger scenario is best able to fit current afterglow lightcurves, but it may have\nproblems matching other observational constraints. We conclude by discussing the issues\nremaining for the different long-duration GRB scenarios.\n\n2.\n\nStellar Winds from Collapsar Progenitors\n\nWeaver et al. (1977) first discussed the structure of wind-driven bubbles produced by\nmassive stars. Assuming that the wind profile varies with at most a linear dependence on\ntime and is spherically symmetric, the structure of these wind-blown bubbles is well known\n(Koo & McKee 1992a,1992b). However, as we shall see in this section, neither of these\nassumptions is strictly true. We study the bubble structure produced by the rapidly varying\nwinds from Wolf-Rayet stars, the likely progenitor star for collapsar GRBs.\n\n2.1.\n\nUnderstanding Wind Profiles\n\nBefore we study realistic wind profiles based on stellar mass-loss histories, we first build\nour intuition of bubbles from winds with constant mass-loss rates blowing into environments\nwith different densities. Such wind blown bubbles have been studied in detail analytically\n(Koo & McKee 1992a,1992b; see Dwarkadas 2005 for a review) and the wind environment\ncan be described by 4 separate regions: (1) the freely-flowing fast wind, (2) the shocked\nfast wind, (3) the shocked interstellar medium and (4) the unshocked interstellar medium.\nFor the purpose of comparing to the afterglow observations, the primary constraints come\nfrom the first region, where the free-flowing winds develop a \u03c1 \u221d r \u22122 density profile. To\novercome the observational constraints, we must either lower the density of this region or\nlimit its size. The free-flowing region is capped by a termination shock (rtermination ), and\nwe will focus on determining what conditions can drive down this termination shock to low\nradii: rtermination < 0.1 pc. At such small size scales, the GRB jet can pass through this\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nregion without seriously impacting the afterglow emission.\nTo understand the dependence of the termination shock radius on the uncertainties in\nwind parameters, we have modified the 1-D Lagrangian code developed by Fryer et al. (1999)\nto include the addition of mass from winds. Wind material is added in zones of constant\nmass. For constant mass loss from winds, this means that zones are added at constant\ntime intervals. The inner boundary of the simulation moves out with the wind velocity.\nWhen a particle is added, its outer radius is set to the inner boundary radius and the inner\nboundary is set to the initial inner boundary radius. By varying the time intervals according\nto individual wind velocities, this technique can be used to simulate winds with varying\nmass loss rates and varying velocities. We model a region from \u223c0.01 to 20-200 pc. For our\n1-dimensional, constant mass-loss studies, the interstellar medium is modeled with between\n\u223c50,000 and 100,000 zones. In 250,000 y, roughly 25,000 zones are added to the simulation.\nTable 1 summarizes all of the parameter study models.\nFigure 1 (top) shows the density profiles for four different wind bubble simulations\ndiffering only in the density of the ambient medium (roughly 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000\ncm\u22123 ). We have assumed a constant wind velocity (1000 km s\u22121 ) and constant mass loss\nrate (10\u22125M\u2299 y \u22121 ) which roughly corresponds to what we would expect from a Wolf-Rayet\nwind. A lot can be learned from these simulations, but we will focus on the radius of\nthe termination shock (rtermination ). 250,000 y of this strong wind produces a termination\nshock that is at a radius of 1 pc if the wind is blowing into an interstellar medium with a\ndensity of 100 cm\u22123 . Fitting to these simulations, we find that the radius of this termination\nshock is \u2248 1(nISM /100cm\u22123 )\u22121/2 pc. It would require very high densities indeed to place the\ntermination shock below 0.1 pc. We include a final simulation (dotted line) that includes a\ncooling routine outlined in Fryer et al. (2006) based on the cooling rates of Sutherland &\nDopita (1993). The primary effect of cooling is to alter the density profile near the shock\nwith the interstellar medium. Another effect is the fact that the UV photons from the star\nwill drive an ionizing front ahead of the wind. This has been recently studied by van Marle\net al. (2004). Although much more must be done to understand its effects, van Marle et al.\n(2004) found that the primary change from the ionization front was in the outer radius of\nthe wind shock. It does not significantly alter the radius of the free-streaming region and we\nwill not consider it further in this paper.\nFigure 1 (bottom) shows the dependence of the termination shock radius on the other\nfree parameters in a constant wind: the mass-loss rate (solid lines) and the wind velocity\n(dotted lines). Here we have assumed a low density interstellar medium (10 cm\u22123 ). The\ndark solid line assumes a mass-loss rate of 10\u22124 M\u2299 y \u22121 whereas the light solid line assumes a\nmass-loss rate of 10\u22126 M\u2299 y \u22121. The termination shock radius is also proportional to the mass\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nloss to the 1/3 power. The dark and light dotted lines assume wind velocities of 500 km s\u22121\nand 2000 km s\u22121 respectively. Although this changes the position of the outer shock of the\nwind-blown bubble, it does not significantly affect the radius of the termination shock.\nTo restrict the termination shock to a radius below 0.1 pc, either the ambient density\nsurrounding the GRB progenitor must be high (nISM > 10, 000cm\u22123) or the Wolf-Rayet wind\nmust have a mass-loss rate much lower than the canonical 10\u22125M\u2299 y \u22121 . Such constraints\nmay not be that extreme. Densities in excess of 10, 000cm\u22123 are common in molecular\nclouds, especially near massive star birthsites. For example, the shock producing the young\nsupernova remnant Cas A is impacting a 650 M\u2299 molecular cloud with densities of 107 cm\u22123 .\nUnfortunately, such a dense medium is ruled out already by afterglow observations (Berger\net al. 2003; Chevalier & Li 2000; Panaitescu & Kumar 2002; Kobayashi & Zhang 2003)2.\nHowever, the Wolf-Rayet mass-loss rate could be much lower than the canonical value\nfor the specific stars that make GRB progenitors. Such a low mass-loss rate might result\nfrom a helium star formed in a binary interaction that causes a 15-20 M\u2299 star to become a\nWolf-Rayet star. Such a star can have a Wolf-Rayet mass loss rate as low as 10\u22127 M\u2299 y \u22121 .\nThis is not entirely satisfactory, as we believe such a star is not likely to collapse to a black\nhole. Alternatively, because the Wolf-Rayet mass-loss rate depends upon the metallicity\n(\u1e40WolfRayet \u221d Z 0.5 \u2212 Z 0.9 ), GRB progenitors with observed surroundings matching constant\ndensity profiles could be limited to low metallicity stars (Yoon & Langer 2005). A low\nmetallicity star turned Wolf-Rayet via a binary common envelope phase could have a very low\nWolf-Rayet mass loss rate. For example, if \u1e40Wolf\u2212Rayet \u221d (Z)0.9 (where Z is the metallicity),\nthen a 25 M\u2299 star with a metallicity 1/100th that of solar could have mass loss rates below\n10\u22127 M\u2299 y \u22121. Not only will the free-streaming region of this wind be small, but its total\ndensity will also be low (a better fit to the observations). With such stars, ambient densities\nof a few hundred cm\u22123 would be sufficient to restrict the termination shock to less than\n0.1 pc.\nBefore we move onto the complexities arising from realistic wind models, we mention\na few other effects that may also limit the free-streaming wind profile in GRB progenitors.\nThese stars may only form in very dense clusters and, if so, the interaction of the winds\ncould limit the extent of the free-streaming profile. Rockefeller et al. (2005) studied the\nhydrodynamics of winds in the Arches and Quintuplet clusters. By analyzing their data, we\nfind that the free-streaming wind region of even the strongest winds can be capped at 0.5 pc\n2\n\nAlthough bear in mind that if we are observing the GRB shock as it progresses through shocked wind\nand ISM material, the observed density will be much less than the density of the interstellar medium. Thus,\nit is possible that large interstellar medium densities can exit.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nat the center of the cluster.\nIn addition, these massive stars may have large velocities with respect to their circumstellar environments. The ram pressure of the wind environment against this circumstellar\nenvironment limits the extent of the wind. This extent can easily be derived by setting the\n\u22122\n2\nfree-streaming wind pressure \u2261 0.5\u03c1wind vwind\n= \u1e40wind /(8\u03c0)rwind\nvwind to the ram pressure\n2\nof the motion through the circumstellar medium \u2261 0.5\u03c1ISM vstar . Here \u03c1wind , vwind , rwind and\n\u1e40wind are, respectively, the density, velocity and radial extent and mass-loss rate of the freestreaming wind; \u03c1ISM is the density of the interstellar medium, and vstar is the motion of the\nstar with respect to this circumstellar medium. Setting these two ram pressures equal, we\nderive an equation for the radial extent of the wind:\n!0.5 \u0012\n\u00130.5 \u0010\n\u1e40wind\n\u03c1ISM \u0011\u22120.5 \u0010 vstar \u0011\u22121\nvwind\nrwind = 0.56\npc. (1)\n10cm\u22123\n100 kms\u22121\n10\u22125 M\u2299 y\u22121\n1000 kms\u22121\nThe number of massive stars with velocities in excess of 100 kms\u22121 is very low (10 \u2212 30%:\nHoogerwerf et al. 2001) and unless something in the progenitor evolution requires these fast\nvelocities, it is unlikely that these motions can explain the environments.\n\n2.2.\n\nReal Stellar Mass Loss\n\nWith the intuition gained from our constant mass-loss winds, we are set to attack the\nmore realistic problem of stellar winds from GRB progenitors. In this paper, we use the\noutput from the Tycho stellar evolution code (Young & Arnett 2005) and we study three\ndifferent possible GRB progenitors: a 40 M\u2299 single star, a 23 M\u2299 binary system and a 16 M\u2299\nbinary system. In the binary systems, we assume that a common envelope phase removes the\nhydrogen envelope of the primary when the primary star expands off the main-sequence. The\nmass loss rate and wind velocities for the GRB progenitors are calculated at each timestep\nduring the evolution. Three prescriptions are used during steady mass loss phases. Mass\nloss for blue, hydrogen-rich stars (logTef f > 3.875) uses Kudritzki et al. (1989). At lower\neffective temperatures appropriate for the red giant/supergiant phases, the prescription of\nBl\u00f6cker (1995) is used. For Wolf-Rayet mass-loss rates, we use the Lamers & Nugis (2003)\nprescription.\nCatastrophic mass loss episodes are dealt with in a more schematic fashion. The 40 M\u2299\nstar is subject to luminous blue variable eruptions. The conditions for the instability (large\nradiative accelerations at temperatures coinciding with \"bumps\" in the continuum opacity)\nare idenitifiable in the stellar model. When these conditions are satisfied a large amount of\nmass is removed from the model to mimic an eruption. Limitations on the numerical stability\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nof the code prevent the mass from being removed as quickly as in a real luminous blue variable\n(LBV) eruption. Instead mass is lost at a high but steady rate dictated by code stability\nfor a period of order 100 years with exact duration dictated by the amount of mass loss\nnecessary. Such episodes can be identified in Figure 2. We choose a conservative approach,\nremoving only enough mass to stabilize the stellar structure, though it is possible that the\nenvelope could be removed to the depth of the instability generating region. Depending on\nthe stellar structure, this could represent several solar masses of ejection. In the first, large\neruption \u223c 1M\u2299 is removed. Subsequent eruptions are smaller, and the bulk of the mass\nloss occurs via steady winds.\nThe 16 and 20 M\u2299 models are intended to represent stars which lose their hydrogen\nenvelopes during the first ascent Red Giant Branch (RGB) to a binary interaction. As with\ncatastrophic eruptions, the physical processes cannot be captured realistically in a 1D stellar\nevolution code, so we must use an approximation. A similar procedure is used, which results\nin an ejection of the hydrogen-rich envelope (\u223c 10 M\u2299 , depending on stellar mass and mass\nloss history) in less than a thousand years. From an evolutionary standpoint, this is a good\napproximation, as the nuclear timescale of the star is much greater than a thousand years\nat this stage. This is not necessarily a good approximation to the mass loss, but it does\nprovide the correct qualitative behavior: a short period of very high density, low velocity\n(\u223c vescape ) mass loss which clears a cavity around the star into which a fast Wolf-Rayet\ntype wind expands. The star subsequently evolves as a WR towards a Type Ib supernova.\nThough the binary ejection of the hydrogen envelope is handled only in a very schematic\nway it does represent, along with the subsequent evolution, a significant improvement over\nconstant density or power law density profiles for the circumstellar medium.\nThe Wolf-Rayet mass loss is characterized by a high mass loss rate, high velocities, and\nan episodic history. The abrupt changes in mass loss occur when the main driver for the mass\nloss switches between opacity bumps at different temperatures and hence different radii in\nthe star (see Lamers & Nugis 2003 for a discussion of the Wolf-Rayet mass loss mechanism).\nEarly transient spikes may represent eruptions driven by high radiative accelerations in the\nstellar atmosphere akin to LBV or Ofpe (Massey et al. 2000) eruptions.\n\n2.3.\n\nWind-Blown Bubbles From Real Winds\n\nThe winds from our Tycho models have a number of characteristics that will complicate\nthe wind profile. Note that the ejection velocity is often low when the mass loss peaks (either\nfrom a LBV eruption or a common envelop mass ejection). The high-velocity wind ejecta\nthat follows these peaks will bounce against the slow-moving, dense, peak ejecta, causing a\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nshock to flow back down through the wind. Also, a similar shock will be produced when the\neruption hits the termination shock. With realistic winds, our free-streaming, \"unshocked\"\nwind region now has many shocks running through it. This will dramatically affect the\nentropy profile of this wind. But afterglow observations are not sensitive to the entropy, but\nrather the the density profile of the wind-blown bubble region.\nTo study the density profile, we first return to our 1-dimensional simulations. By allowing non-constant time intervals for the addition of zones, we can incorporate the variable\nmass-loss rate and time-dependent wind velocity profiles from our Tycho models. We assume\nan ambient interstellar density of 100cm\u22123 . Table 1 lists the simulations of these realistic\nmass-loss profiles; we give rough ranges for the mass loss rates and velocities instead of absolute values. We model the wind-driven bubble only during the last few hundred thousand\nyears of the star's life: 0.6, 0.5, 0.6 Myr for the 16,23,40 M\u2299 stars respectively. Although\nthis reduced time does not accurately model the outer extent of the winds, it does get the\nposition of the free-streaming region fairly accurately3 . Most of the explosive phases of mass\nloss occurs during this time, and it is this ejecta that dominates the density profile of the\nfree-streaming wind region. Figure 3 shows the density profiles of these models flowing in\nan ambient density of 100 cm\u22123 . For these models, it is difficult to pinpoint the termination\nshock of the free-streaming wind and there is no strict \u03c1 \u221d r \u22122 dependence to the density.\nBut the density does decrease roughly as r \u22122 well beyond 1 pc. Recall that the termination\nshock from our 10\u22125 M\u2299 y \u22121, nISM = 100 cm\u22123 calculation was at 1 pc (even for the 40 M\u2299\nstar where the mass loss exceeds this standard value). The ambient medium would have to\nexceed 104 cm\u22123 to reduce this region below 0.1 pc. This density is probably ruled out by\nthe timescale of the radio emission (see Section 2.1).\nWe find that episodic spikes in the mass loss produce a termination shock which causes a\nsignificant departure from an \u03c1 \u221d r \u22122 density profile. This does not help the situation much\nbecause the region of departure from a free-streaming profile propagates out from the star at\nroughly the velocity of the slow moving ejecta (\u223c a few 100km s\u22121 ). Thus the density profile\nis disturbed within the 0.1 pc limit for 1000 years or less, roughly 1% of the time between\neruptions. Although we cannot rule out such epsiodes within 1000 years of collapse unless\nthe stellar surface is hotter than \u223c 5 \u00d7 105 K (hotter than the continuum opacity bumps\nwhich drive the high mass loss rates), the odds of an ejection event occurring within 1000\nyears of collapse are too small to explain the distribution of afterglows unless the frequency\nof ejection events increases as the star approaches collapse. We do not observe this behavior,\n3\n\nVikram Dwarkadas is currently modeling the full wind profiles of our binary star in an effort to understand the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. The extent of the free-streaming region from his shock agrees\nwith ours at the 20% level.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nbut the uncertainties in the physics of mass loss do not allow us to eliminate the possibility.\nAnother wrinkle in this model is the fact that these winds are far from spherically\nsymmetric. As argued by Fryer et al. (1998), the idea that GRB progenitors most likely\narise from binary systems is gaining increasing acceptance (Petrovic et al. 2005, Fryer &\nHeger 2005). If the wind is not already asymmetric due to rotation (Maeder & Meynet\n2000), the binary interaction will ensure that it is. If the mass ejection arises from common\nenvelope evolution, then this mass outflow at least is highly asymmetric. LBV eruptions are\nalso observed to be strongly bipolar.\nWe have modified the three-dimensional SNSPH code (Fryer, Rockefeller & Warren\n2005) to model these winds and then study the effects of asymmetries on the density structure. We add particles in shells centered on the location of the wind source, after a time\n\u2206t \u2243 h/vwind has passed since the last addition of particles, where h is the SPH particle\nsmoothing length and vwind is the current value of the wind velocity. The mass of each particle is set according to m = \u1e40wind \u2206t/nshell , where \u1e40wind is the current value of the wind\nmass loss rate and nshell is the number of particles per shell. We remove particles from the\nsimulation when they pass beyond 3 pc from the wind source.\nFigure 4 shows the density profile of one such SPH simulation. A 23 M\u2299 binary system,\nlocated at the center of the simulated volume, ejects material during a common envelope\nphase at a rate of \u223c 0.1M\u2299 yr\u22121 . We assume that this material is not ejected isotropically;\ninstead, we place it in a 45\u25e6 wedge oriented perpendicular to the z axis. The subsequent\nwind from the binary system has a much higher velocity but represents a much lower rate\nof mass loss from the system, so the wind collides with the inner edge of the dense wedge\nand flows out of the system primarily along the z axis. In this calculation, each added shell\nof wind material contains 400 SPH particles, each shell is added at a radius of 0.01 pc from\nthe wind source, and the inner edge of the dense wedge is at r = 0.3 pc. The total number\nof particles in the simulated volume is \u223c 350, 000 but fluctuates slightly as the wind velocity\nchanges.\nDespite the modifications we have introduced to the wind profiles, we have not produced\nany conditions that cause the density profile of the wind-blown bubble to differ significantly\nfrom the \u03c1 \u221d r \u22122 dependence. With these results in mind, our proposed solution for a\nthe massive star progenitor for GRBs is a low-metallicity, 20-25 M\u2299 star turned into a WolfRayet star through a binary common envelope phase. A 23 M\u2299 progenitor with a metallicity\n1/100th that of solar would have a weak Wolf-Rayet wind, but also be massive enough to\ncollapse to form a black hole. A GRB in a high metallicity host would rule out such a\nscenario, forcing us to progenitor models like the He-merger scenario.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n3.\n\nHe-Merger GRB Progenitors\n\nBefore we study the environments surrounding He-merger GRB progenitors, we first\nreview the He-merger scenario itself. The He-merger progenitor for GRBs invokes a binary\nsystem where the most massive star collapses to either a neutron star or a black hole. If this\ncompact object merges with its companion, it will spiral into the center of the companion\nwhile spinning up the companion. In this merger, the binary has satisfied the three main\nrequirements behind the collapsar model: 1) the compact object accretes enough to collapse\nto a black hole, 2) the star surrounding the black hole has enough angular momentum\n(perhaps too much as we will discuss below) to form a disk around that black hole, and 3)\nthe hydrogen envelope is ejected in a common envelope excretion disk.\nThere are two main binary evolution scenarios that dominate the production of HeMerger progenitors of GRBs: common envelope mergers and kick-induced mergers of nearly\nequal mass stars. Figure 5 shows the basic evolutionary phases in the common envelope\nscenario. In this scenario, we generally begin with an initial binary in a fairly close orbit (.\n1 A.U.). The more massive star (\"primary\") evolves off the main sequence and, for most\nprogenitors, envelops its companion as it turns into a giant (or supergiant) star. This causes\nthe orbital separation of the binary to tighten in a common envelope phase. The primary\nthen collapses, forming either a neutron star or black hole. A fraction of these binary systems\nwill remain bound after the supernova explosion. When the companion star evolves off the\nmain sequence, it can envelop the compact remnant produced by the collapse of the primary.\nA fraction of these binaries will merge during this second common envelope phase, producing\na helium-merger GRB.\nThe second main scenario we loosely term the \"Brown\" He-merger scenario because it\nuses similar initial conditions (a binary system with nearly equal massed stars) to a double\nneutron star formation scenario proposed by Bethe & Brown (1998). The idea of Bethe &\nBrown (1998) was to consider binary systems where the two stellar components have masses\nthat are so close that the less massive star evolves off the main sequence before the more\nmassive star collapses to form a compact remnant (this corresponds to masses of the two\nstars that are within \u223c10% of each other). In their model, the two helium stars produced\nduring the mass transfer phase are pushed into a tight binary that remains bound through\nthe two subsequent supernova explosions, forming a system with two compact objects. In\nour scenario, we follow the Bethe & Brown (1998) evolution up to the point that we form\ntwo helium stars in a tight binary (Fig. 6). When the first helium core collapses, its kick\ncan drive it into its companion, producing a helium-merger GRB.\nThis \"Brown\" He-merger scenario uses supernova kicks to cause the compact object to\nmerge with its stellar companion. This begs the question of whether a kick imparted to the\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\ncompact object formed during the collapse of the primary can drive the neutron star or black\nhole into its main sequence companion (Fig. 7). Because main sequence stars are not quite\nas compact as helium stars, we expect lower accretion rates in these models, possibly making\nthis scenario less viable as a GRB progenitor. In addition, Fryer et al. (1999) pointed out\nthat this main-sequence star mechanism is rare. We will explicitly discuss the rates here,\nfinding that this mechanism accounts for less than \u223c5% of the total helium-merger GRB\npopulation for most simulations.\nThese three different progenitor scenarios produce very different environments through\nwhich the GRB jet will pass (Table 2). Both mechanisms 2 and 3 produce mergers very\nsoon after (generally within a few years of) the supernova explosion. GRB explosions for\nthese two scenarios will first pass through a young supernova remnant and then through the\nwind from the Wolf-Rayet progenitor. Scenario 1 does not produce a GRB until long after\n(\u223c 1\u221210 Myr) the collapse of the primary star. With the kick imparted to the system during\nthe collapse of the binary, most bursts from this progenitor occur beyond the edge of the\nsupernova remnant and the Wolf-Rayet wind termination shock. Hence, the environment\nsurrounding these bursts will not be the wind-swept structure characteristics we expect\nfrom Wolf-Rayet stars. The immediate environment surrounding these bursts will either be\ncharacterized by a constant density medium (if the companion is low-mass: < 15 \u2212 20 M\u2299 )\nor by the giant winds from the companion. In this section, we study the relative frequencies\nof occurrence of these different burst scenarios and their velocity, merger time, and position\ndistributions including a brief study of the uncertainties of all these values.\n\n3.1.\n\nPossible Constraints on the Helium merger\n\nIt is likely that only a subclass of He-mergers will produce GRBs. Currently we do not\nunderstand the progenitors or the collapsar mechanism well enough to definitively exclude\nsome progenitors. Perhaps observations of GRBs can provide some insight into the progenitor\nsubclass that truly makes GRBs. Here we discuss a variety of He-merger subclasses that\nmay make up the true set of GRB progenitors. We will then study each of these subclasses\nseparately when we present our population synthesis results. Table 3 summarizes these\ndifferent subclasses.\nOne of the sources of uncertainty in our population synthesis studies is that we don't\nknow exactly what conditions actually produce GRBs. For example, Fryer & Woosley (1998)\nassumed that the primary could collapse into either a neutron star or a black hole and still\nbe a candidate GRB progenitor. Their assumption, which has been borne out by current\nsimulations (Zhang & Fryer 2001), is that even if the compact remnant were a neutron star,\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nit would accrete so much in the inspiral phase that it would become a black hole quickly,\nsatisfying the \"black hole requirement\" producing collapsars. But if the accretion rate is not\nso extreme (angular momentum, for example, could drive outflows), then the neutron star\nmay not collapse to form a black hole and such a progenitor will not produce a collapsar.\nAlternatively, it may be that black holes accrete too much mass, making inefficient collapsars\nunable to drive strong GRB jets. We will look separately at systems whose primary collapses\nto a neutron star versus those systems whose primary collapses to form a black hole. This\ngives us two separate subclasses based on the initial status of the compact remnant: 1) a\nneutron star or 2) a black hole.\nAnother constraint on the progenitor may be the amount of angular momentum. When\nZhang & Fryer (2001) modeled their mergers, they focused on maximizing the angular momentum surrounding their collapsar black hole. They assumed that the stars were, if anything, spinning in the same direction as the orbital angular momentum. They also assumed\nthat very little orbital angular momentum was required to remove the hydrogen envelope\nand that all of the orbital angular momentum was deposited in the helium star. This produced very high angular momentum disks in the merged black hole accretion disk system,\nleading some to argue that this progenitor does not produce a viable GRB (Di Matteo et\nal. 2002). However, recall that Zhang & Fryer (2001) were trying to maximize the angular\nmomentum in the system. The angular momentum could be much lower if most of the orbital angular momentum is lost to the hydrogen envelope or if the star is spinning in the\nopposite direction with respect to the binary orbit. Mergers produced with kicks may also\nlead to lower angular momenta. In general, we assume that a star's spin direction in a binary\ncoincides with the direction of the orbit. This is almost certainly true prior to the supernova\nexplosion. But the kick imparted to the compact object during supernova explosion can (and\noften does for those binaries that remain bound) produce binaries where the spin angular\nmomentum direction is 180 degrees off from the orbital angular momentum of the binary.\nThis subclass is defined in our calculations by restricting our sample to those companion\nstars whose helium star moment of inertia (from the helium stars of Fryer & Heger 2005,\n2\nIHe\u2212Star \u2248 0.1MHe\u2212Star RHe\u2212Star\n) is greater than the moment of inertia of the merging compact\n2\nobject when it reaches the helium star radius (ICompactBinary = MCompactObject RHe\u2212Star\n).\nLastly, if the companion star is too massive, it too will blow a wind, leading to a\nsurrounding wind environment not too different from the Wolf-Rayet winds produced by the\nprimary star. We define this subclass of low-mass losing systems by restricting our sample\nto systems with companions whose total mass-loss is less than 1 M\u2299 . This essentially limits\nus to binaries where the initial mass of the companion is less than 15 M\u2299 .\nWith these four subclasses in mind, we can now analyze our population synthesis studies.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n3.2.\n\nPopulation Synthesis studies\n\nOur population synthesis calculations are based on the code described in Fryer et al.\n(1998,1999). The main alteration to this code has been to update the mass of the collapsed\ncore using the results of Fryer & Kalogera (2001). Fryer et al. (1999) set the remnant mass\nfor stars collapsing to neutron stars to 1.4 M\u2299 and the remnant mass for stars collapsing to\nblack holes to one third the mass of the star at collapse. In this paper, we have fit a function\nto the results of Fryer & Kalogera (2001), allowing a more continuous spread of neutron star\nand black hole masses. We refer the reader to Fryer et al. (1998,1999) for any other details\nabout the population synthesis technique or the specific code we use. We have run over a\ndozen models using a wide range of choices for the uncertain binary population synthesis\nparameters (Table 4).\nTable 4 shows a list of all the population synthesis models studied in this paper followed\nby the values of the population synthesis parameters used by each model. For a more\ndetailed description of each of these parameters, see Fryer et al. (1999). We focus on just\na few parameters: the power law of the initial mass function (\u03b1IMF ), the distribution of\nvelocities imparted to compact objects at collapse (kick), mass transfer parameters denoting\nthe fraction of overflowing matter in a binary accreted by the companion (\u03b2MT ) and the\nspecific angular momentum of the overflowing matter ejected, and hence lost, from the\nbinary (\u03b1MT ), and the efficiency with which the inspiralling star in a common envelope\nphase ejects the envelope (\u03b1CE ). We sample both our primary and secondary stars from the\nsame initial mass function, constraining the secondary to be less massive than the primary.\nAfter some argument about the distribution of kicks arising from stellar collapse, it is now\ngenerally accepted that a bimodal kick distribution like that proposed by Fryer, Burrows,\n& Benz (1998) is roughly correct (Arzoumanian et al. 2002). We term the kick distribution\nrepresented by two Maxwellians of 50 and 500 km s\u22121 the FBB kick distribution. We have\nalso used a set of single Maxwellian distributions covering a range of mean values to better\nunderstand the of the dependence on the kick magnitude. Finally, we have run a few tests\nof the dependencies on the stellar mass loss rates and radii. We model 50 million binaries in\neach simulation.\nFryer et al. (1999) presented very few results outlining the characteristics of the Helium\nMerger model, focusing mostly on the formation rate. Here we study the distribution of\nmerger velocities, merger times and distances traveled before GRB outburst for the various\nsubclasses of He-merger progenitor. The explosion and the supernova kick impart a velocity\nto the binary (if it remains bound). Figure 8a shows the distribution of the post-collapse\nvelocities of He-Mergers for our \"Standard\" model (Table 4). The dark solid line shows\nthe number of binaries per 1 km s\u22121 bin for all He-merger progenitors. Although for most\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nsubclasses, the bulk of the systems have velocities below 25 km s\u22121 (where the total number\npeaks), a second peak exists above 100 km s\u22121 . The two peaks arise because of the double\npeaked nature of the supernova kick distribution. The peak at low velocities is not present for\ntwo subclasses of He-merger models: those with initially black hole compact remnants and\nthose with high moments of inertia. Note that the peak in low-velocity systems is dominated\nby the NS Collapse and Low-Wind models. Because the kick must nearly exactly counter\nthe momentum lost in the supernova ejecta for our strong supernova models, the systems\nthat are more likely to remain bound for these NS binaries are those where the countering\neffects lead to small proper motions. None of the kick velocities are high enough to escape\ntheir host galaxy's gravitational potential unless the galaxy is extremely small.\nFigure 8b shows the merger times for the same model as Fig. 8a. The peaks below\n100 years arises from binaries following the \"Brown Merger\" scenario or the \"MS Merger\"\nscenario (Scenarios II and III)4 . For most of these systems, the stars merge within a few\nmonths of the collapse of the primary. For Scenario I, the merger rates are determined by\nthe remaining main-sequence lifetime of the companion. Note that the low wind (small mass)\nsubclass dominates the long merger times, but nearly all of the subclasses have the full range\nof merger times. Figure 8c shows the distribution in distance traveled before outburst for\nthe He-merger population. This distribution is determined by multiplying the velocity of the\nbinary times its merger time. Here again, the <1 pc bin is made up entirely of the \"Brown\"\nscenario and the main-sequence kick scenario.\nIn Figures 8d-f, we show the same set of data for the velocity, merger time, and distance\ndistributions as a function of fractions relative to the total number in a subclass instead of\ntotal number. Because the rate of these mergers is still very difficult to determine due to a\nnumber of uncertainties (e.g. binary mass fraction and initial mass function), such relative\nabundances are most appropriate for comparison to observations. From these plots we can\nsee that in the total He-merger population, less than 20% occur within 1 pc of their initial\nformation site. This is essentially a statement that less than 20% of He-merger systems are\nformed in the Brown and MS Merger scenarios. The moment of inertia subclass produces\nthe most extended distribution of mergers.\nTo demonstrate the effect of the kick distribution, we compare to a single Maxwellian\nkick distribution. Figure 9a-c shows the fractional distributions of velocity, merger time,\nand distance travelled for our Max300 mode. The scales have been kept identical to those\nused in figures 8d-f and these simulations can be compared directly. Note the lack of the\n4\n\nThe peak between 10-100 y is produced by the Brown scenario in systems where the helium cores do not\ngo through a common envelope phase but are kicked in such a manner to merger - very rare indeed\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\ndouble peak in the velocity distribution. Figures 10 and 11 show the velocity, merger time,\nand distance travelled distributions for a series of models, but focusing only on the total\nHe-merger population. Figure 10 focuses on different mass transfer and binary parameters the two most important being stellar radii and stellar mass loss. Figure 11 shows the results\nof a series of models using single Maxwellian kick distributions of varying strengths.\nTables 5,6 and 7 summarize the results of all of the simulations. Table 5 shows the\nmerger rates assuming that a massive binary is formed every 100y. In general, the standard\nHe-merger scenario dominates > 75% of all the He-mergers formed. We confirm the results of\nFryer et al. (1999) that the main sequence merger rate is very low (< 5\u221210% of all mergers).\nGiven the high uncertainty in the rate, we can not rule out any scenario or subclass, or claim\nany subclass as the sole formation scenario or subclass based on the GRB rate, but both\nthe main sequence merger scenario and the high moment of inertia subclass definitely have\nrates on the low end to be the sole path for GRB formation. Table 6 lists velocity and\nmerger time information. High velocity systems are rare, so any observations that argue\nfor a high velocity in the merging system would place strong constraints on some of the\npopulation synthesis uncertainties. The strongest constraint at the moment may well be the\nnumber of systems that merge within a wind background versus systems in a more constant\nmedium. The effective observational constraint on this is the distance these systems travel\nbefore merging (Table 7). Systems with stars that initially collapse to form black holes tend\nto move faster but merge quicker, and are likely to be closer to their formation sites. As the\nobservational implications get stronger, it is possible that we will be able to home in on the\ntrue GRB progenitor subclass.\nSome final summarizing comments on the nature of these populations:\n\u2022 Roughly 20% (15% if we exclude main-sequence mergers as they may not be dense\nenough to produce GRBs) of all He-mergers will occur with the wind-driven shroud\nproduced by the collapse of the star forming the compact remnant for the GRB. These\nBursts will not only occur within the wind, but also within a young supernova remnant\n(< 10 y old).\n\u2022 The rest of the systems produce bursts \u223c1-50 million years after the collapse of their\nmassive component, roughly 10-100 million years after the initial burst of star formation.\n\u2022 Although some bursts can occur 1 kpc away from their initial star formation, the bulk\noccur within 100 pc of their formation sites.\nWhat do these results tell us about the environments around He-Merger GRBs? Although\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nthe star forming the compact object in these systems may have had a Wolf-Rayet wind profile,\nbecause of the delay in the explosion, the environment surrounding the system during the\nGRB outburst need not have this r \u22122 density profile. If all of the progenitors we discussed\nhere make GRBs, 80% of He-mergers will not be characterized by a strong Wolf-Rayet wind\nenvironment. If the companion to the compact remnant exhibits strong winds, its wind profile\nwill dominate the surrounding medium. But, in our simulations, 60-90% of the companions\nhave masses below 15\u2299 and hence will not have winds that strongly affect the surrounding\nmedium. In comparing to GRB afterglows, the surrounding media of these systems (80%\n\u00d7 60-90% = 50-70% of all systems) will exhibit constant density profiles. But take these\nfractions with some caution - we do not know what subset of all He-mergers will actually\nproduce GRBs, and depending upon this subset, the relative rates will change.\n\n4.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have studied the environments around collapsar-like long-duration gamma-ray bursts.\nWe have focused on two classes of progenitors that have been proposed to explain these GRB\nexplosions with their associated supernovae: the collapse of a massive star and the merger\nof a compact object with its stellar companion. The progenitor class leading to massive star\ncollapse is characterized by progenitors whose mass loss prior to collapse is extremely high.\nThe environment surrounding these progenitors is defined by this mass loss rate. The general\nassumption (e.g. Chevalier et al. 2004) is that the density profile follows an r \u22122 profile with\na density proportional to a constant mass loss. But the mass loss for these massive stars is\nanything but constant. This variability leads to modifications to the r \u22122 profile. In addition,\nthe mass loss can be significantly asymmetric, leading to additional wrinkles in the profile of\nthe surrounding environment. In general, these modifications are not sufficient to resolve the\ndiscrepancies between predictions of this progenitor scenario and the observations. Recent\nwork studying mass loss in GRB progenitors has indicated that these environment observations contain a wealth of information about the bursts (van Marle et al. 2005, Eldridge et\nal. 2006).\nAlthough further study (both theoretical and observational) is required, we are now\npushed to some extreme predictions in order for the classic massive star progenitor scenario\nfor GRBs to produce roughly half of all GRB explosions within constant density environments. In addition, the low densities predicted by some GRB progenitors will be much\nharder to produce with massive star progenitors. This, in effect, is strike two for the massive star collapse progenitor for long-duration GRBs \u2013 the first strike being the difficulty in\ngetting enough angular momentum to form black hole accretion disks in these progenitors\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n(e.g. Petrovic et al. 2005, Fryer & Heger 2005). A possible solution may still exist if GRB\nprogenitors are low-mass (20-25 M\u2299 ), low-metallicity stars. The resultant Wolf-Rayet winds\nfor such stars could be less than 10\u22127 M\u2299 y \u22121.\nThe other class of progenitor, the He-merger model, invokes the merger of a compact\nremnant from a massive star with its companion. Although this progenitor model also\nbegins with a massive star with strong winds, the system can travel up to 1 kpc from this\nwind environment prior to the GRB explosion. We described 3 different formation scenarios:\nthe classic \"He-merger\" model produced when the companion envelops its compact remnant\ncompanion, the Brown merger scenario requiring nearly equal-massed binary stars, and the\nmain-sequence kick scenario. The relative rates of these three scenarios are roughly 80:15:5\nrespectively. Essentially all of the classic He-merger systems explode more than 10 pc from\ntheir initial formation site. For these models, the surrounding environments are not set\nby any wind profile (unless the companion star also has a strong wind). In contrast, the\nBrown and main-sequence merger scenarios occur within the wind profile of the compact\nremnant forming star. Indeed, the GRB from these scenarios will occur within 10-100 y\nof the collapse of the primary (and its possible explosion). Assuming that these scenarios\nproduce all long-duration GRBs, we predict at least 20% of all GRBs should have wind\nprofiles. The remaining 80% will exhibit weaker wind environments (not from Wolf-Rayet\nstars) of the NS/BH companion, 60-90% of which are stars with masses below 15 M\u2299 . This\nmeans that, if all He-mergers produce GRBs, we expect that 50-70% of all GRBs should\noccur in ISM-like surroundings. Roughly 20-30% of these bursts will occur more than 100 pc\nfrom their initial formation sites.\nIt appears that the He-merger class of long-duration progenitors fits the constant density\nsurroundings better than the stellar collapse progenitors. This is not surprising. Fryer &\nWoosley (1998) proposed this model, in part, to explain this observation. However, this\nmodel still has one strike against it: these mergers tend to have too much angular momentum.\nNote also that these progenitors predict significant hydrogen in an excretion disk not too\nfar from the collapsing star. Although one would not expect hydrogen lines to be strong in\nthe supernova explosion accompanying the GRB from this He-merger progenitor, ultimately\nevidence of the supernova shock interacting this disk may produce some hydrogen emission\nakin to the hydrogen line emission observed in the Type Ia supernova 1999ee (Mazzali et al.\n2005).\nIf He-merers are the only long-duration GRB progenitor, these constraints will probably\nrequire that only a subset of all the possible He-merger models actually produce GRBs, but\nmuch more detailed calculations (both of population synthesis and of common envelope\nmergers) are required to constrain this subset. Observations combined with population\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nsynthesis studies may provide clues to the true subclass of He-mergers responsible for the\nformation of GRBs.\nIf observations can constrain the subclass of He-mergers that produce GRBs, we may\nalso be able to constrain some of the uncertainties currently plaguing population synthesis\ncalculations. We can use these comparisons to help validate our population synthesis codes\nfor use in other binary calculations: e.g. the prediction of populations of X-ray binaries.\nThese calculations also ultimately teach us about stellar evolution. The most clear-cut\nexamples of uncertain parameters in this study are stellar radii and stellar winds. In this\nway, studying the environments around GRBs not only teach us about GRBs, but also the\nobjects that make GRBs.\nAlternatively, both progenitor scenarios may produce GRBS: the He-merger model\nwould be responsible for producing all \u03c1 =constant ambient medium bursts along with\nsome of the \u03c1 \u221d r \u22122 bursts; the classic massive star progenitor will account for a fraction of\nthe \u03c1 \u221d r \u22122 wind-blown bubble bursts.\nAcknowledgments This work was funded in part under the auspices of the U.S. Dept.\nof Energy, and supported by its contract W-7405-ENG-36 to Los Alamos National Laboratory, by a DOE SciDAC grant DE-FC02-01ER41176 and NASA Grant N5-SWIFT05-0014.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nArzoumanian, Z., Chernoff, D.F., Cordes, J.M.

The top panel shows models with\nmass loss rates of 10\u22125 M\u2299 y \u22121 and wind velocities of 1,000 km s\u22121 for a range of densities in\nthe ambient interstellar medium. The wind extends well into the interstellar medium (beyond\n10 pc for ambient densities of 10 cm\u22123 ). For afterglow observations, the most critical feature\nis the size of the free-streaming region. It is in this region that the density follows a \u03c1 \u221d r \u22122\ndependence on distance. This region is smaller for higher interstellar densities. Sound waves\nmove back and forth through the shocked wind/ISM region, causing density perturbations,\nboth real and numerical. The wiggles in the shocked region of our highest-density cases are\nnumerical in origin. The dotted line in this top panel shows the result from our simulation\nincluding cooling (see Table 1 for details). The bottom panel studies the dependencies on\nthe mass loss rate and the wind velocity around a model assuming a 10\u22125 M\u2299 y \u22121 mass\nloss rate, wind velocity of 1,000 km s\u22121 and ambient density of 10 cm\u22123 .

Note that the mass loss is\nfar from constant with some pulses lasting for less than 100,000 y. The largest mass outflows\noften are the lowest velocity flows and this can lead to shocks as the fast moving material\nfollowing the peak outflows catches these peaks.\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Density versus radius for the wind bubbles produced by our 3 stellar models: 40 M\u2299\nstar (solid line), 23 M\u2299 star (dotted), 16 M\u2299 star (dashed line). The effects of the variable\nmass loss can be seen (for instance, see the density peak in the 23 M\u2299 star at roughly 3 pc),\nbut the density profiles still follow a roughly \u03c1 \u221d r \u22122 profile even beyond the true termination\nshock of the free-streaming wind and far enough out that it should dominate what we see\nin the GRB afterglow observations. The points show the density profile along the z-axis in\nour 3-dimensional model. This model was for the 23 M\u2299 binary star assuming zero density\nambient medium except for a circumstellar disk caused by the binary interaction (see Fig.\n4).\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- A 3-D SPH model of wind from a massive star interacting with a wedge of dense\nmaterial ejected during the common envelope phase of a binary system. The location of each\nSPH particle is marked by a colored point, and the color indicates the number density of\ngas at that location. The wind-producing star is located at the center of the simulation box;\nthe wedge of material ejected during the common envelope phase is oriented perpendicular\nto the z (vertical) axis. Wind particles are injected at a radius of 0.01 pc, the inner edge of\nthe dense wedge is located at 0.3 pc, and particles are removed from the simulation when\nthey travel more than 3 pc from the origin. The density of gas in the wedge is much larger\nthan in the subsequently-ejected wind, so the wind is obstructed by the wedge and escapes\nprimarily along the z axis.\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\n\nScenario I: Standard (CE evolution)\nMS\n\nOrbital Separation<~ 1 AU\nMS\n\nPrimary Evolves off Main Sequence\nPrimary Expands\n\nRed Giant\n\nMS\n\nRoche Lobe Overflow\nMass Transfer, Possible\nCommon Envelope\n\nCollapse \u2212 Formation of BH or NS\nSecondary Evolves\nOff Main Sequence\nX\u2212ray Binary Phase\n\nRed Giant\n\nCommon Envelope Phase\nOrbital Separation Shrinks\nHypercritical Accretion\nStars\nMerge\nHe\n\nCompact object Accretes to become BH\nFig. 5.- Standard formation scenario for He-merger progenitors. Two stars in a close\nbinary undergo at least 1 common envelope phase, and often 2 such phases. The first, not\nrequired, occurs when the primary (more massive star) evolves off the main sequence. After\nthe common envelope phase, the primary collapses to form a neutron star or black hole. If\nthe system remains bound after this collapse and its orbit is close enough, the binary will\ngo through a second common envelope phase when the companion to the compact remnant\nevolves off the main sequence. If the compact object merges with its companion, a Heliummerger is formed.\n\n\f\u2013 35 \u2013\n\nScenario II: \"Brown\" Scenario\nInitial Conditions:\nMP > MSN\nMS >\n~ 0.95 MP\n\nMS\n\nOrbital Separation <\n~ 1 AU\n\nMS\n\nPrimary Evolves off Main Sequence\nPrimary Expands\nCommon Envelope Phase\nHe\n\nMS\n\nSecondary Evolves Off Main Sequence\n\nHe\n\nHe\n\nDouble Helium Star\nBinary\n\nEnvelope Ejected \u2212 Primary Collapse\nNS/BH Kicked into\nHelium Companion\nHe\n\nFig. 6.- Secondary formation scenario of helium-mergers.

The different curves denote different subclasses and have the\nsame definitions for each plot: dark solid - all systems, dark dotted - angular momentum,\nlight solid - BH Collapse, light dotted - NS Collapse, and dashed - Low-Wind (see Table\n3 for details). a) Number of binaries per 1 km s\u22121 bin. The peak in low velocity systems\nonly occurs in the neutron star compact object and small companion mass subclasses. The\nvelocities are only high enough to escape the host galaxy gravitational potential if the host is\nan extremely low-mass galaxy. Note that the peak in low-velocity systems is dominated by\nthe NS Collapse and Low-Wind models. It is difficult for those systems that form neutron\nstars to remain bound, requiring the kick to counter the momentum lost in the supernova\nejecta. The systems that are more likely to remain bound for these NS binaries are those\nwhere the countering effects lead to small proper motions. b) Number of binaries per log\nTime bin (900 bins in plot). The large spike in binaries with merger times . 10y arises from\nthe Brown and MS Merger formation scenarios. These scenarios only produce immediate\nmergers. The bulk of long merger times are produced by those mergers with low wind (and\nhence low-mass) companions. c) Number of binaries per 1 pc bin. The spike at low distances\ncorresponds to the Brown and MS-merger formation scenarios where the merger time is\nnearly immediate (see figure 8b). Even for the primary He-merger scenario, most mergers\noccur within 100 pc of ther formation site.
