The phonon-mediated,\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) pairing mechanism was identified by the boron isotope\neffect,2 as well as through other supporting experiments, including tunneling,3\u22125\nphotoemission spectroscopy,6,7 and nuclear magnetic resonance.8 Recent theoretical\nwork has predicted a two-band energy model for the MgB2 superconductor, with two\ndifferent BCS order parameters \u2206,9 closing at the same critical temperature value Tc: the\n2-dimensional \u03c3 band gap \u2206\u03c3 with 2\u2206\u03c3/kBTc \u2248 4 and the 3-dimensional \u03c0 band gap \u2206\u03c0\nwith 2\u2206\u03c0/kBTc \u2248 1.3. It was stressed by Liu et al.9 that these two different \u2206's could be\nobserved only in the clean limit, when the interband scattering is very weak. Indeed, the\nexperimental\n\ndata,\n\nobtained\n\nusing\n\nthe\n\npoint-contact\n\nand\n\nscanning-tunneling\n\nspectroscopies, are in good agreement with the \u2206\u03c3 and \u2206\u03c0 values predicted by the\ntheory.3\u22125 The anomalous behavior of the MgB2 specific heat temperature dependence\nhas also been explained within the two-gap model.10\nIn the dirty limit, due to strong interband and intraband scattering, one can\ntypically measure an isotropic energy gap \u2206dirty with the zero temperature value of about\n4 meV.11 The temperature dependence of \u2206dirty deviates considerably from the BCS \u2206(T)\ncurve,7,12 with a hump at temperatures below Tc.13 Although the existence of the hump\ncould be accounted for by introducing proximity-induced intergap coupling, the most\nnatural explanation was presented using the two-gap model with two different Tc values:\nTc,dirty corresponding to the BCS \u2206dirty(T) dependence and the specimen's Tc, related to\n2\n\n\fclosing of \u2206\u03c0.13 The detailed correlation between the Tc's and the interband and\nintraband scattering mechanisms has been studied in the framework of the two-gap model\nby Mazin et al,14 and this approach is most suitable for MgB2 thin films fabricated using\na post-annealing process, since they exhibit both the crystalline and amorphous features.\nIn this letter, we present time-resolved, pump-probe measurements of postannealed MgB2 thin films with very smooth surface morphology. The Mg-B precursor\nfilms were prepared by co-evaporation of Mg (purity 99.8%) and B (purity 99.9%)\ncomponents on unheated r-cut sapphire and mica substrates. The deposited precursors\nwere about 120 nm thick and were ex-situ annealed in a vacuum chamber, using a\ncomputer-controlled halogen-lamp heater.15 The annealing temperature was increased at\nthe rate of 40oC/s for mica and 60oC/s for sapphire substrates and was leveled at 720oC\nfor 300 s. Next, the halogen lamps were switched off and the chamber was filled with Ar\nto quench the samples to room temperature in 30 s. The resultant MgB2 films were\namorphous with nanocrystal inclusions16 and exhibited optically smooth surfaces. For\nboth mica and sapphire substrates, the onset of the superconducting transition Tc,on was\n~35 K and the transition width was approximately 3 K. The critical current density jc at\n4.2 K was about 107 Acm\u22122.\nOptical pump-probe measurements of transient reflectivity change \u2206R/R were\nperformed on MgB2 thin films in the temperature T range from 10 K to 300 K. The\nsamples were mounted on a cold finger in a T-controlled, liquid-helium continuous-flow\noptical cryostat. The light source was a commercial Ti:Sapphire laser, which produced\n100-fs-wide pulses at a repetition rate of 76 MHz. Since we did not observe any\n\n3\n\n\fwavelength dependence of the \u2206R/R signal within the tunable range (710 nm to 950 nm)\nof our laser, we chose 800-nm wavelength (1.5-eV photon energy) to be our working\noptical radiation. The pump and probe beams were cross-polarized to avoid the coherent\nartifact, with an energy ratio of at least 10:1. The spot sizes on the samples were <100 \u03bcm\nin diameter. The probe-beam reflected from the samples was collected by a photodetector\nand measured using a lock-in system. The pump energy was always smaller than 26 pJ\nper pulse (~2-mW average power) to avoid sample heating.\nFigure 1 shows a set of three MgB2 photoresponse \u2206R/R signals, each typical for\na different T range. In all cases, the \u2206R/R rise time is limited by the width of the\nexcitation pulses, while the relaxation processes change quite significantly with T. At\nhigh T's (300 K to approx. 70 K), the signal is dominated by a fast, single-exponential\ndecay with a time constant \u03c41 \u2248 160 fs, as the electron system loses its high excess energy\nthrough the electron-phonon (e-ph) interaction.17 This behavior is in good agreement\nwith previous pump-probe measurements, performed on various metallic thin films at\nroom temperature.18 The sub-ps relaxation is followed by a component with a decay time\n\n\u03c42 of the order of several picoseconds. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the amplitude of this\nfew-ps process is almost negligible at high temperatures. However, it becomes significant\nin the photoresponse below 70 K, so that the \u2206R/R signal is bi-exponential, as a\ncombination of \u03c41 and \u03c42 relaxations, with \u03c42 strongly dependent on T. Finally, below Tc,\na third process appears, in addition to the sub-ps and few-ps components existing above\nTc. This third process is characterized by a T-dependent negative amplitude and a\nrelaxation time \u03c43 on the order of hundreds of picoseconds, as shown in the inset in Fig.\n4\n\n\f1. The decay time \u03c43 is independent of the sample temperature, but it varies with different\nsubstrate materials.\nTo better understand the complex nature of the experimentally observed \u2206R/R\nresponses, we decomposed the total signals, using the nonlinear least squares fitting\nmethod into three separate single-exponential processes with different time constants of\n\n\u03c41, \u03c42, and \u03c43. Figure 2(a) shows that the bi-exponential \u2206R/R observed between Tc and\n70 K (solid squares) can be fitted as the sum of two processes: the sub-ps e-ph process\n(dotted line), the same as observed at high T's (see top curve in Fig. 1) and is\ncharacterized by the same \u03c41 \u2248 160 fs, and the few-ps e-ph process (dash-dotted line) with\nthe T-dependent \u03c42. For the completeness of simulations, we also added a small, very\nslow offset (dashed line), which is a signature of not studied here, long-lasting phonon\ncooling process.18 Figure 2(b) demonstrates that the experimental \u2206R/R at temperature\nfar below Tc (solid squares) consists of the two e-ph relaxation processes (dotted and\ndashed-dotted lines) observed above Tc, and the third process with a negative amplitude\nand a sub-nanosecond time constant \u03c43. The solid lines shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) are\nsuperpositions of the three individual, single-exponential relaxation fittings and\nreproduce the experimental data extremely well.\nIn this work, we focus on the relaxation processes characterized by the \u03c42 and \u03c43\ntime constants, as the fast (\u03c41) e-ph process represents the initial cooling of very hot\nelectrons and, as we stressed before, its nature is well understood.17,18 The slowest (\u03c43)\nprocess with the negative amplitude is clearly related to superconductivity in MgB2 since\nit only exists below Tc and represents the decrease in the total number of excited\n5\n\n\felectrons as they annihilate, forming Cooper pairs. The time evolution of the negative\n\u2206R/R component is T independent and is characterized by \u03c43 \u2248 400 ps for ~100-nm-thick\nMgB2-on-sapphire films, and by a somewhat shorter \u03c43 value for the MgB2-on-mica\nfilms. Thus, we can identify \u03c43 as the phonon escape time \u03c4es.19 We must stress that the\nnegative \u2206R/R component in the superconducting state was reported earlier in a lot of\nworks devoted to pump-probe studies of high-temperature superconductors (HTS).20,21\nIn our MgB2 films, this superconducting component could be seen only under a very\nweak pump perturbation. With high incident pump power (e.g., 5 mW of average power),\nthe \u2206R/R signal below Tc contained only the positive components22 [analogous to Fig.\n2(a)], as the optical energy transferred from the electron system to phonons was large\nenough to drive the phonon temperature above Tc during the early relaxation stage. The\nnegative component was also absent at T < Tc when our MgB2 films were driven into\ntheir resistive state by a dc bias.22\nThe T dependence of the amplitude of the negative \u2206R/R component (closed\nsquares) is shown in Fig. 3. The most striking is a hump-like behavior just below\nTc.13,23 As the negative component reflects the superconducting state of the material,\none can expect that it should follow the \u2206(T) dependence. The dashed line in Fig. 3\nrepresents the BCS \u2206(T) best fit. We note that at higher temperatures, our experimental\ndata points deviate quite significantly from the BCS dependence. Fits based on the strong\ncoupling formalism and the formula \u2206(T) = \u2206(0)[1 \u2013 (T/Tc)p]1/2 derived by Choi et al.24\nalso failed to fit the experimental data.\n\n6\n\n\fThe alternative approach is to fit the data with a combination of two BCS \u2206(T)\ndependences (solid lines): one representing the isotropic \u2206dirty(T), closing at Tc,dirty =\n30.5 K, and the other corresponding to the 3-dimensional \u2206\u03c0(T), closing at Tc = 34.7 K,\nequal to Tc,on earlier obtained from the resistance versus temperature measurement. The\nabove model should be applicable for the mixed clean/dirty case and is consistent with\nthe fabrication procedure of our MgB2 films.13,14,23 Our films are definitively not in the\nclean regime, as is reflected by their relatively high normal-state resistivity [\u03c1DC(T = 40\nK) > 10 \u03bc\u03a9cm],14 and there must exist an enhanced intraband \u03c0 scattering. The\n\"dirtiness\" of our films result in appearance of the isotropic \u2206dirty. On the other hand,\nTc,dirty is significantly larger than the 22-K value, predicted for the 100% dirty case.9\nThus, we also observe a contribution from the clean state, through the presence of \u2206\u03c0(T),\nclosing at Tc,on.\nThe picosecond (\u03c42) e-ph relaxation process exists both below and above Tc, and\nits time constant \u03c42 is strongly dependent on T below 70 K, as shown in Fig. 4. First, we\nnotice a divergence of \u03c42. The divergence of the relaxation time constant at Tc was\nreported previously in different HTS materials.25,26 It indicates an opening of the\nsuperconducting gap and is associated with the quasiparticle inelastic scattering and\nCooper-pair formation, as the excited carriers pile up at the edge of \u2206. In our case, \u03c42\nclearly diverges at Tc,on, but there is an anomaly in the \u03c42(T) behavior that indicates a\nsecond, lower temperature divergence at T corresponding to Tc,dirty. To confirm our\nfindings, the inset in Fig. 4 shows the same \u03c42(T) dependence measured in a different\n7\n\n\fexperimental run with more accurate temperature resolution\u2013the double divergence is\nclearly visible. At the same time, no hysteresis in \u03c42(T) with respect to ramping the\ntemperature up or down was observed. Since the two temperatures at which \u03c42 diverges\nin Fig. 4 are the same as the Tc values for the \u2206dirty and \u2206\u03c0 gaps in Fig. 3, the double\ndivergence in \u03c42(T) directly supports our earlier conclusion that in our post-annealed\nMgB2 films, the superconducting state is characterized by two superconducting gaps\nclosing at two different Tc's, with \u2206\u03c0 being the main gap corresponding to Tc,on.\nAbove Tc, \u03c42 decreases gradually over a wide T range from Tc to 70 K. Our fitting\nprocedure returns nonzero \u03c42 values even at temperatures above 90 K. But as we\ndiscussed in Fig. 1, the amplitude of this \u03c42 relaxation process above 70 K becomes very\nsmall and the dynamics of the \u2206R/R signal in the >70-K range is dominated by the sub-ps\ne-ph relaxation. However, the fact that this few-ps relaxation component with the Tdependent \u03c42 extends to so far above Tc,on is in direct contradiction with previous reports\non HTS materials, in which \u03c42 would vanish within a few kelvins above Tc.25,26 We\nhave no solid explanation of this effect and tentatively interpret this few-ps relaxation\nprocess as an additional e-ph interaction. The e-ph coupling in MgB2 is complicated, and\nthe phonon modes are highly inharmonic.9 Thus, the \u03c41 and \u03c42 relaxation processes could\nbe associated as electron interactions with different phonon modes.\nIn conclusion, we have found that at room temperature and down to\napproximately 70 K, MgB2 thin films respond to femtosecond optical photoexcitation as\nordinary metallic thin films with a dominant sub-ps e-ph relaxation process. Below 70 K,\n\n8\n\n\fa few-ps-long relaxation component becomes significant, indicating additional e-ph\ninteraction. Finally, below Tc, there is a third photoresponse component, which we\nassociate with the dynamics of the superconducting state and the recombination of\nquasiparticles into Cooper pairs. The time evolution of this latter component is sub-ns\nand corresponds to the phonon escape from the MgB2 films. The temperature dependence\nof the amplitude of this superconducting component follows the \u2206(T) anomalous\ntemperature dependence, which can be interpreted for our MgB2 films in the mixed\nclean/dirty limit as the two energy gaps, \u2206dirty and \u2206\u03c0 closing at two different values of\nTc, (Tc,dirty and Tc,on, respectively). The same two Tc's are also visible in the doubledivergence of the relaxation time constant of the few-ps e-ph photoresponse component.\nOur work confirms that the 3-dimensional, small \u03c0 band gap is the intrinsic, bulk\nproperty of MgB2 and can be observed even in the dirty case.\nThis work was supported by the US NSF grant DMR-0073366 and the NATO\nLinkage grant PST.CLG.978718 (Rochester), and by the Slovak Grant Agency for\nScience grants 2/7072/2000 and VEGA-1/9177/02 (Bratislava).
