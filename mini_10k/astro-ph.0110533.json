In this paper we examine constraints on\nthe RED (To be specific, we consider constraints on the\nenergy density of any particle that obeys an equation of\nstate P = \u03c1/3.) at various cosmological epochs and discuss how these bounds can be used to limit the mass and\nlifetime of an unstable big bang relic particle. We review the classic big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound\nand the bound from the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) anisotropy power spectrum. We present a new\nbound derived from the magnitude-redshift relation of\nType Ia supernovae (SNIa), and we update the bound\nfrom large scale structure (LSS). Although we will attempt to derive bounds that are independent of additional cosmological parameters, where necessary we will\nborrow constraints from other techniques in order to\nfurther limit the relativistic energy density of the Universe. For example, when needed we adopt the bound\n0.1 \u2264 \u03a9M \u2264 0.5 (\u03a9M is the matter density relative to\nthe critical density today, \u03c1crit \u2261 3H02 /8\u03c0G), consistent\nwith recent measurements of the contemporary matter\ndensity from lensing [1], the rich cluster baryon fraction\n[2], mass-to-light ratio estimates [3], and the power spectrum of the Ly\u03b1 forest [4]. We also adopt a hard limit\non the Hubble parameter (h \u2261 H0 /100 kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ) of\n0.56 \u2264 h \u2264 0.88 in accordance with the 2\u03c3 range of the\nHST Key Project [5].\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: zentner@pacific.mps.ohio-state.edu\naddress: twalker@pacific.mps.ohio-state.edu\n\nNucleosynthesis Constraint\n\nIt has long been known that an increase in the RED of\nthe Universe during BBN leads to an overproduction of\n4\nHe [6] (BBN reviews include [7]). Prior to freeze-out of\nthe weak interactions, the neutron-to-proton ratio (n/p)\ntracks its equilibrium value. As the Universe expands and\ncools, the weak interactions freeze-out and (n/p) freezes\nin. Freeze-out occurs when the weak interaction rates\nbecome comparable to the expansion rate H, given by\nH 2 = 8\u03c0G\u03c1/3, where \u03c1 is the mean cosmological energy\ndensity. Once deuterium can be synthesized nearly all\navailable neutrons are incorporated into 4 He. Increasing the energy density of the Universe during BBN increases the expansion rate, causing the weak interactions\nto freeze-out at a higher temperature and therefore, at a\nhigher value of (n/p). An increased expansion rate also\nallows less time for free neutron decay. Both effects make\nmore neutrons available for 4 He synthesis.\nIn addition, BBN production of 4 He slowly increases\nwith the baryon density or equivalently, the baryon-tophoton ratio, \u03b7 \u2261 nB /n\u03b3 . Since BBN production of deuterium is a rapidly decreasing function of \u03b7, the baryon\ndensity can be deduced from the D/H ratio observed in\nQSO absorption line systems. Furthermore, because 4 He\nhas been produced in stars since BBN, the observed 4 He\nabundance places an upper limit on its primordial abundance. Armed with this upper bound to primordial 4 He\nand an independent measure of \u03b7, we can place a bound\non the RED during the BBN epoch (z \u223c 109 ).\nWe illustrate the current status of the BBN bound\nto the RED as follows (see the recent analyses of [8]\nfor details). We adopt a liberal range for the primordial D/H ratio that accommodates recent observations\nof deuterium in several QSO absorption line systems [9]:\n1.75 \u2264 105 (D/H) \u2264 5.0. We then bound the RED by\ntaking a conservative bound on the 4 He mass fraction,\nYP \u2264 0.25.

First, although (2) is a rather stringent\nbound on the RED, corresponding to an increase of \u223c 5%\nover the standard \u03c1\u03b3\u03bd , it only applies during the epoch of\nnucleosynthesis. Relativistic energy injected after BBN\nis not subject to this bound (in Section III, we discuss a\ntoy model in which relativistic energy is injected into the\nUniverse after the light nuclide abundances have been\nfixed). Second, the BBN RED bound is flavor dependent in the sense that extra relativistic energy in the\n\nFIG. 2: Constraints on the RED. The horizontal lines denote\nthe maximum value of \u03b8(z) allowed by BBN, CMB, LSS and\nSNIa. Notice that the BBN constraint in the lower right-hand\ncorner is hardly noticeable (i.e., very strict). By extending\nthe limits to higher redshift, we have made the assumption\nthat after BBN relativistic energy is only injected and never\nremoved. The curved line shows \u03b8(z) in a scenario where\na massive big bang relic with MkeV Y = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 decays\nwith lifetime \u03c4yr = 2 \u00d7 109 . There are additional CMB and\nLSS constraints on relativistic energy injected after z \u223c 1000;\nhowever, they do not rule out the decay shown above (see\nsections III and IV).\n\nform of degenerate electron neutrinos changes the rates\nof the weak interactions that inter-convert protons and\nneutrons thereby changing theoretical BBN yields. Introducing an appropriate amount of electron neutrino\ndegeneracy can always compensate for excess relativistic\nenergy present during nucleosynthesis [14, 15], nullifying\nthe BBN RED constraint.\n\nB.\n\nCMB Constraint\n\nThe CMB anisotropy power spectrum is also sensitive\nto the RED of the Universe at recombination, primarily\nthrough the early Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect.\nThe erosion of gravitational potentials due to incomplete\nmatter domination at recombination leads to a boost in\npower, particularly near the first acoustic peak (for a review see [16]). CMB constraints on relativistic energy\ncomplement those from BBN in two ways. First, the\nCMB constraints are flavor independent; the power spectrum measures relativistic energy regardless of its form.\nSecond, the CMB constrains the RED at later epochs\nso that the CMB can be used to study the injection of\nrelativistic energy after the epoch of nucleosynthesis, for\nexample, by massive neutrino decays.\nWang, Tegmark & Zaldarriaga [17] have compiled a\ncombined CMB data set including the recent results from\n\n\f3\nthe BOOMERANG [18], MAXIMA [19] and DASI [20]\nexperiments. Hannestad [21] has performed a likelihood\nanalysis on this combined data set and found, with weak\npriors on the Hubble and tilt parameters and the baryon\ndensity, N\u03bd,ef f \u2264 19 with 95% confidence. In terms of\nthe RED present at recombination, \u03b8CMB \u2261 \u03b8(z \u2248 1100),\nthis bound is\n\u03b8CMB <\n\u223c 3.2\n\n(3)\n\nas depicted in Figure 2.\nA cautionary note is in order. Although the priors\nchosen by Hannestad are quite conservative, it must be\nborne in mind that the bound in (3) does depend upon\nthese priors. For example, by adopting tighter, yet reasonable, prior constraints on h and \u03b7, Hannestad shrinks\n\nthe above limit to N\u03bd,ef f \u2264 17.5 at 95% confidence [21]\n(see also [22]). Kneller et al., [15] have explored the prior\ndependence of these bounds in detail, showing that the\nbound on N\u03bd,ef f scales with the upper bound chosen for\n\u03a9M (i.e., interesting CMB bounds on the RED require a\nprior constraint on \u03a9M ).\n\nC.\n\nConstraints from Type Ia Supernovae\n\nGiven a distant population of so-called \"standard candles\", the magnitude-redshift relation is a powerful way\nto determine cosmological parameters directly [23]. In a\nstandard FRW cosmology, the apparent bolometric magnitude, m(z), of a standard candle is related to its absolute bolometric magnitude, M , and redshift by\n\nm(z) = M + 5 log(DL (z, \u03a9M , \u03a9\u039b , \u03a9R )) \u2212 5 log(H0 ) + 25,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere H0 is the Hubble parameter in kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .

We have re-analyzed the data\nof Perlmutter et al. [25] allowing for a non-negligible\ncontribution from \u03a9R . For simplicity, we have assumed\nflatness to be a robust result of CMB measurements\n[27] and have performed a maximum-likelihood analy2\nsis (we take L \u221d e\u2212\u03c7 /2 subject to the priors \u03a9M \u2265 0,\n\u03a9R \u2265 0) in order to derive constraints on \u03a9M and\n\u03a9R with \u03a9\u039b \u2261 1 \u2212 \u03a9M \u2212 \u03a9R 1 .\n\n1\n\nRelaxing flatness yields a less restrictive bound on \u03a9R but much\nof the favored region of parameter space would be ruled out by\n\nIn Figure 3, we show the constraints on \u03a9M and \u03a9R\nfrom SNIa. The projection \u03a9R = 0 is consistent with\nearlier analyses that found \u03a9M \u223c 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b \u223c 0.7 assuming the RED to be negligible. Allowing for relativistic\nenergy density, we find a degenerate set of \u03a9M and \u03a9R\nthat are consistent with the SNIa data: the high-mattercontent (i.e., 30% matter, 70% cosmological constant)\nflat Universe and the high-radiation-content (i.e., 20%\nradiation, 80% cosmological constant) flat Universe are\nequally good fits. Observe that regardless of whether relativistic energy is allowed or not, the SNIa data require\n<\na large cosmological constant (0.6<\n\u223c \u03a9\u039b \u223c 0.9).\nThe 95% confidence contour is approximately fit by the\nregion\n\u03a9R + 0.62\u03a9M \u2248 0.17 \u00b1 0.08.\n\n(5)\n\nIt is not surprising that the data pick out this degenerate\nvalley in the \u03a9M -\u03a9R plane because most of the SNIa data\nare from z \u223c 0.5 and our degenerate valley represents\nthe parameters with approximately constant luminosity\ndistance at this redshift.

For illustration, we show several labeled\nisochrones (dotted) and the elliptical 95% confidence contour\nobtained by adding an additional prior constraint of \u03a9M =\n0.3 \u00b1 0.1 (solid, heavy). Also shown are contours of constant\neffective mB for SNIa at redshifts of z = 0.5 (dashed at mB =\n23, 23.2) and z = 1.5 (dash-dot at mB = 26, 26.2).\n\ndot-dashed lines in Figure 3 depict contours of constant\napparent magnitude at redshifts z = 0.5 and z = 1.5\nrespectively. As most of the SNIa data lie near z \u223c 0.5,\nthe confidence region is nearly parallel to lines of constant\nmB at z = 0.5. At higher redshifts, lines of constant\napparent magnitude have a more shallow slope and are\ncloser together, thus observations of SNIa at z > 0.5 can\nbreak the matter-radiation degeneracy.\nFigure 4 further illustrates the large lever arm of highz SNIa for cosmological parameter estimation. Notice\nthat the magnitude-redshift relation in a high-mattercontent Universe (\u03a9M = 0.3, \u03a9R = 0) is quite similar\nto that in a high-radiation-content Universe (\u03a9R = 0.2,\n\u03a9M = 0) at z <\n\u223c 0.5. At higher redshift, one begins\nto probe the epoch prior to matter-\u039b and/or radiation\u039b equality; the cosmological constant becomes increasingly unimportant compared to radiation and/or matter and the two curves begin to diverge. The SCP\ndata only extend to z = 0.83, therefore they cannot be\nused to scrutinize this earlier phase and they cannot distinguish between a high-matter-content Universe and a\nhigh-radiation-content Universe. The proposed Supernova Acceleration Probe ([http://snap.lbl.gov]) may have\nthe ability to break this degeneracy by observing many\nmore SNIa at significantly higher redshift.\nMarginalizing over \u03a9M by integrating the likelihood,\nwe obtain a bound on the RED at low redshift \u03b8SNIa \u2261\n\u03b8(z <\n\u223c 0.5),\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nz\n\nFIG. 4: The high-redshift portion of the Hubble diagram for\nthe SCP data (with 1\u03c3 error bars) alongside the magnituderedshift relation in several flat cosmologies: \u03a9M = 0.3 and\n\u03a9R = 0 (heavy, solid), \u03a9M = 0 and \u03a9R = 0.2 (dashed),\n\u03a9\u039b = 1 (dotted), \u03a9M = 1 (dash-dot), \u03a9R = 1 (light, solid).\n\n2\n3\n2\n3\n\u03b8SNIa <\n\u223c 3.4h \u00d7 10 (68%) or 4.8h \u00d7 10 (95%).\n\n(6)\n\nIn terms of the RED today, the bound is \u03a9R \u2264 0.14\n(68%) and \u03a9R \u2264 0.20 (95%).\nThe SNIa constraint on the RED applies during recent epochs, namely, z <\n\u223c 0.5, as can be seen in Figure\n2. Of course, in light of other estimates of cosmological\nparameters, the allowed region in Fig. 3 is not equally\nprobable. Estimates of the contemporary matter density of the Universe favor the region \u03a9M = 0.3 \u00b1 0.1\nand would slightly reduce the SNIa upper bound on the\nRED. This is illustrated in Figure 3 where we also plot\nthe 95% confidence contour obtained with the additional\nprior constraint \u03a9M = 0.3 \u00b1 0.1. This prior constraint\non the matter density reduces the 95% bound on \u03a9R by\nabout 25%.\nNote also that the SNIa bound on the contemporary\nRED is more stringent than bounds that follow from the\nrequirement that the expansion age of the Universe be\nat least as large as the ages of the oldest objects in the\nUniverse. In Figure 3, the entire region delineated by\nSNIa data corresponds to an acceptable age. In particular, a high-radiation-content Universe with \u03a9M = 0.04,\n\u03a9R = 0.20, \u03a9\u039b = 0.76 and a Hubble parameter at the\nextreme lower limit, h = 0.56, is 13.8 Gyr old. Even with\nh = 0.72, t0 \u2243 10.7 Gyr, a value that is not grossly inconsistent with the ages of the oldest stars and globular\nclusters [28].\n\n\f5\nD.\n\nTaking the lower bound \u0393 > 0.06 we immediately come\nupon a generic constraint on the mean RED:\n\nLarge Scale Structure Constraints\n\nThe effect of additional relativistic energy on the\ngrowth of large scale structure (LSS) has been studied\nby numerous authors [29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. Typically,\nthe introduction of \"hot dark matter\" was considered a\nmeans to suppress power on small scales and thus reconcile an \u03a9M = 1, Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmology\nwith the observed power spectrum derived from galaxy\nsurveys [34]. Conversely, too much relativistic energy adversely affects the growth of structure and therefore LSS\ncan be used to constrain the RED. In light of mounting\nevidence, the CDM paradigm has given way to the socalled \u039bCDM paradigm with \u03a9M \u223c 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b \u223c 0.7.\nWith this in mind, we revise previous work in order to\nconstrain the relativistic energy content of the Universe\nusing LSS.\nThe most striking feature of a CDM or \u039bCDM\ntype power spectrum is a break in the power law at,\nroughly speaking, the co-moving horizon scale at matterradiation equality\n\u03bbEQ \u2243 16(\u03a9M h)\u22121 h\u22121 Mpc.\n\n(7)\n\nThis feature arises because the growth of sub-horizon\nsized perturbations is quelled by the cosmological expansion during radiation domination. Hence, perturbations\non scales smaller than \u03bbEQ are suppressed by a factor\n\u223c (\u03bb/\u03bbEQ )2 relative to scales that were super-horizon\nsized at matter radiation equality.\nIf the RED of the Universe is contained entirely in photons and three light neutrino species, and if the primordial power spectrum is nearly scale-invariant, the \u039bCDM\nmatter power spectrum can be expressed in terms of only\none quantity, the shape parameter \u0393 \u2243 \u03a9M h [35] (this\nneglects the effect of baryons, see [36]). Several authors\nhave used LSS observations on linear scales to infer acceptable values of the shape parameter [37]. One of the\nmore permissive of these determinations is the 95% range\n0.06 \u2264 \u0393 \u2264 0.46,\n\nq\n\n\u03a9R /\u03a9\u03b3\u03bd h\u22121 Mpc\n\n(9)\n\nand the effective shape parameter is therefore given by\n[31]\n\u0393 \u2243 \u03a9M h\u03b8\u22121/2 .\n\n(10)\n\n!2\n\n.\n\n(11)\n\nWith our conservative assumptions that \u03a9M \u2264 0.5 and\nh \u2264 0.88, the corresponding restriction on the RED during (and prior to) the epoch of matter-radiation equality,\n\u03b8LSS \u2261 \u03b8(z = zEQ ), is\n\u03b8LSS <\n\u223c 54\n\n(12)\n\nwhere 1 + zEQ \u2261 \u03a9M /\u03a9R . The relative weakness of\nthis bound is due to our conservative lower bound on\n\u0393. Taking the 95% band of Eisenstein & Zaldarriagga\n[37], 0.15 \u2264 \u0393 \u2264 0.58, results in \u03b8LSS <\n\u223c 9.\nNote that this constraint (12) allows the epoch of\nmatter-radiation equality to be at redshifts as low as\nzEQ \u2248 120. We can obtain a more stringent bound on\nthe RED by following an argument invoked by Turner,\nSteigman & Krauss [29], Steigman & Turner [30] and\nTurner & White [33]. Assuming a nearly scale-invariant\nprimordial power spectrum, data from the COBE DMR\nexperiment [39] indicate that the rms density contrast\nat horizon crossing is on the order of \u03b4H \u223c few \u00d7 10\u22125\n[40]. Meanwhile, measurements of the galaxy correlation function reveal nonlinear clustering on scales smaller\nthan a critical scale, \u03bbNL \u223c 5h\u22121 Mpc [41]. We adopt\nthe conservative constraint that perturbations on scales\nsmaller than \u03bbNL must have grown by at least a factor of \u03b3min \u2261 103 in order for the rms perturbation on\nthese scales to be nonlinear. In linear perturbation theory, density fluctuations grow as \u03b4 \u221d (1 + z)\u22121 during\nmatter domination and only logarithmically during radiation domination. This implies that the matter dominated epoch must span at least three orders of magnitude in redshift. With \u03a9M \u2264 0.5 this, in turn, imposes\nthe limitation\n\n(8)\n\nquoted by Efstathiou & Moody [38], which we will use to\nconstrain the RED.\nIn the presence of excess relativistic energy, the horizon\nscale at matter-radiation equality is no longer given by\n(7).

This constraint is shown\nin Figure 2 where we summarize the constraints on relativistic energy imposed by BBN, the CMB, LSS and the\nSNIa magnitude-redshift relation.\n\nIII.\n\nCONSTRAINING RELIC DECAYS\n\nIn the preceding section we reported limits on the RED\nat various epochs. In the absence of electron neutrino degeneracy, the BBN constraint on the RED is, by far, the\nmost stringent; it leaves little room for any non-standard\nrelativistic energy during the BBN epoch. One way to\n\n\f6\n\n\u03a9X h2 \u2243 274MkeV Y.\n\n(14)\n\nIn (14), MkeV is the mass of the particle in keV and\nY is the ratio of the number density of the particle to\nthe entropy density (Y \u2243 0.039 for a light neutrino,\nY \u2243 2\u00d710\u221210 for a 5 GeV, Dirac neutrino). Given a specific particle physics model in which X is produced in the\nearly Universe, Y is fixed (in the absence of subsequent\nentropy production); however, in order to make the constraints on heavy particle decays as generic as possible,\nwe have chosen to keep Y as an explicit, free parameter. Further, we assume that the daughter particles are\nweakly-interacting (constraints on radiative decays are\nquite severe [42]). In all analytic calculations we assume\nthat decays occur simultaneously at t = \u03c4 . Energy conservation during decay demands that the present energy\ndensity in decay products be \u03a9D = \u03a9X /(1 + zD ), where\nzD is the redshift at decay (i.e., z at t = \u03c4 ). Assuming\nthe Universe to be X-dominated prior to decay,\n4/3\n\n2/3\n\u03a9D h2 \u2243 5.1 \u00d7 10\u22124 MkeV Y 4/3 \u03c4yr\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03c4yr is the lifetime of X in years.\nA.\n\nCMB Constraints on Relic Properties\n\nOne constraint on relic properties follows from the requirement that the total energy density in relativistic\nparticles \u03a9R = \u03a9\u03b3\u03bd + \u03a9D , fall under the CMB bound\nin (3) during the epoch of recombination. If the particle\ndecays prior to recombination the CMB constraint (3),\nalong with the analytic approximation of (15), implies\nthat2\n\n2\n\nThe CMB constraint on relativistic energy is strict enough that\nthe assumption of X-domination prior to decay is untenable,\n\n10\n9\n8\n\nSNIa\n\n7\n6\n5\nyr\n\nlog(\u03c4 )\n\ncircumvent the BBN constraint is to inject relativistic energy after nucleosynthesis has ended, for instance, by the\ndecay of a particle that was non-relativistic during BBN\n(M \u226b 1 MeV) into relativistic products. As such, the\nstudy of relic particle decays comes part and parcel with\nconstraints on relativistic energy. We examine the simple\ncase of a massive, unstable big bang relic which may be\npertinent to physics \"beyond the Standard Model\" and\ndiscuss constraints on the relic's mass and lifetime that\nfollow from the bounds on the RED in Section II. It is\nimportant to note that, aside from the CMB constraint,\nthe assumption that the relic is very massive is not critical. In general, the particle must be non-relativistic at\ndecay in order for its decay product's energy density to\nbe comparable to or greater than \u03c1\u03b3\u03bd .\nConsider the decay of a massive relic particle X, with\nlifetime \u03c4 , into relativistic products. Had X not decayed,\nthe energy density in these particles today would be\n\n4\n\nCMB\n\n3\n\nLSS\n\n2\n1\n0\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\u22123\n\u22125\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\nlog(M\n\n0\nY)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nkeV\n\nFIG. 5: The regions of parameter space for a massive relic\ndecay that are excluded by CMB (heavily shaded), LSS (moderately shaded) and SNIa (lightly shaded) arguments.

It is possible to use this modification\nof the observed CMB anisotropy power spectrum to constrain post-recombination X decays [43], but these constraints would not be generic because the gravitational\ndynamics of the relic as well as its decay scheme can contribute to the ISW effect. Such constraints would have\nto be developed on a case-by-case basis considering the\nrelic mass and relic abundance separately; however, we\nmention a specific case that evades the CMB bound and\ncontributes a significant RED at the present epoch in section IV. In the following subsection, we show that the\ngrowth of LSS can place severe, yet generic, constraints\non post-recombination decays.\n\nB.\n\nLSS Constraints on Relic Decays\n\nLarge scale structure considerations also lead to\nbounds on decaying relics. Utilizing (15), \u03b8 can be ex-\n\nmaking it necessary to integrate the equations governing heavy\nWIMP decay in a flat, Friedmann cosmology. We have performed\nthe necessary integration and find that the above analytic bound\nis typically accurate to within 20%.\n\n\f7\n4/3\n\n2/3\n\npressed as \u03b8 \u2243 1 + 12.2MkeV Y 4/3 \u03c4yr .

In practice, however, much of\nthe interesting region of relic parameter space would correspond to nonlinear scales and such a constraint would\nrequire a better theoretical handle on nonlinear clustering and bias.\nWe can strengthen the bound in (19) by requiring that\nstructure grow sufficiently. As Steigman and Turner [30]\nhave noted, there are two ways in which this can occur.\nOne way was mentioned in Section II D, namely, that the\nrelic decay early enough so that the most recent epoch of\nmatter domination began at a redshift (1 + zEQ ) \u2265 103 .\nThe redshift of equality is (1 + zEQ ) \u2243 \u03a9M /\u03a9D and using\n(14) and (15) we find that this scenario requires\n2\nY 2 \u03c4yr <\nMkeV\n\u223c 0.66\n\nWith our aforementioned limits on \u03a9M and h, these scales\ngrow by a maximum of \u03b3 \u2243 9.3 \u00d7 103. Perturbations that\nenter the horizon after X domination begins, grow by a\nsmaller factor:\n\n(19)\n\nObserve that (19) restricts the combination\n2\nMkeV\nY 2 \u03c4yr . As has been underscored by McNally\n& Peacock and Bharadwaj & Sethi [32], the power\nspectrum will also exhibit a feature on small scales\ncorresponding to the transition between radiation domination and an early matter dominated (domination by X\nparticles) phase. As the co-moving horizon scale during\nthe first epoch of matter-radiation equality is given by\n\n\u03bbX \u2243\n\n(22)\n\n(18)\n\nAgain, taking \u03a9M \u2264 0.5, h \u2264 0.88 and \u0393 \u2265 0.06, we\ndeduce that\n2\nMkeV\nY 2 \u03c4yr <\n\u223c 16.\n\n(1 + zX )\n(1 + zEQ ) \u2243 2.4 \u00d7 104 \u03a9M h2 .\n(1 + zD )\n\n\u22122 <\n\u22122\nMkeV Y <\n\u223c 3.6h \u00d7 10 \u223c 3.2 \u00d7 10 .\n\n(24)\n\nCombining (19), (21) and (24), we summarize the LSS\nconstraints on early relic decays as\n2\nMkeV\nY 2 \u03c4yr <\n\u223c 0.66 or\n2\n2\n\u22122\n<\nMkeV Y \u03c4yr <\n\u223c 16 and MkeV Y \u223c 3.2 \u00d7 10 . (25)\n\nThe excluded region is shown in Figure 5.\nThe above constraints (25) are pertinent for lifetimes in\n< 6\nthe range 10\u22123 <\n\u223c \u03c4yr \u223c 10 because we assumed that the\nturnover in the power spectrum is indicative of \u03bbEQ , the\nhorizon scale at the epoch of matter-radiation equality after X decay. Alternatively, the X particles may have very\nlarge lifetimes, \u03c4yr \u226b 106 , in which case the turnover in\nthe power spectrum would be indicative of \u03bbX , the horizon scale at the first epoch of matter-radiation equality,\nprior to X decay. In this case, the effective shape parameter is simply\n\u0393 \u2243 (\u03a9X + \u03a9M )h.\n\n(26)\n\nIf we adopt our limiting case that \u03a9M \u2265 0.1 in order to\nbe consistent with various measures of the contemporary\nmatter density, we find that the restriction \u0393 \u2264 0.46 from\n(8) asserts that\n\n(21)\n\n< 5\nand is relevant for lifetimes in the range 10\u22123 <\n\u223c \u03c4yr \u223c 10 .\nIn the presence of a massive unstable relic however,\nthere can be two phases of matter domination, an early X\ndominated phase and a second matter dominated phase\nafter relic decay. It may be possible for perturbations on\nscales \u03bb < \u03bbNL to take advantage of both of these periods\nof growth and thereby grow by a factor greater than \u03b3min .\nX domination begins at redshift (1 + zX ) = \u03a9X /\u03a9\u03b3\u03bd ,\nfollowed by decay at redshift (1 + zD ) = \u03a9X /\u03a9D . Thus\nthe total growth factor for scales smaller than the horizon\nscale at X domination, \u03bbX , is\n\n\u22123\nMkeV Y <\n\u223c 1.2 \u00d7 10 .\n\n(27)\n\nWe illustrate this bound in Figure 5 by the vertical\n7\n4\nboundary for \u03c4yr >\n\u223c 10 . Lastly, because (1 + zEQ ) \u223c 10\nin this scenario and \u03a9X is not more than a factor of five\n3\nlarger than our lower bound on \u03a9M , requiring \u03b3min >\n\u223c 10\nprovides only a weak restriction on X lifetimes. It may\nbe more useful to take advantage of the large scale feature that would be present in the power spectrum due to\nthe injection of relativistic energy in order to limit relic\nproperties. We do not explore such bounds as this would\nrequire specifying MkeV and Y separately.\n\n\f8\nC.\n\nSNIa Constraint on Relic Decays\n\nWith the SNIa bound on relativistic energy from Section II C, it is now easy to obtain a SNIa bound on the\nrelic decay properties. Using (15) and the 95% upper\nlimit in (6), we have\n3\n2\nMkeV\nY 2 \u03c4yr <\n\u223c 5.3 \u00d7 10 ,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere we have once again assumed h \u2264 0.88. Notice\nthat this follows from a bound on the contemporary\nRED and, therefore, is most pertinent to late decays\n8\n(i.e., \u03c4yr >\n\u223c 10 ). Again, this constraint is shown in Figure\n5 where our bounds on the properties of decaying relics\nare summarized.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nConstraints on the cosmological RED can provide a\nfundamental probe of particle physics beyond the standard model. In this paper we have discussed constraints\non the RED during four distinct epochs arising from\nBBN, the CMB, LSS and SNIa (see Figure 2). Further, we have shown how these bounds constrain the\nmass and lifetime of a hypothetical big bang relic (see\nFigure 5). Somewhat surprisingly, the RED at the current epoch is relatively unconstrained: we have shown\nthat the magnitude-redshift relation for SNIa is consistent with a flat universe comprised of up to 20% relativistic energy. Conventional wisdom suggests that the\nRED today must be small to allow for sufficient growth of\nlarge scale structure and not appreciably alter the CMB\nanisotropy power spectrum. The LSS bound does, in\nfact, significantly limit the RED near the epoch of matterradiation equality. Any RED consistent with subsequent\n\n[1] L.

Turner,\n\ngrowth of LSS, redshifted to the current epoch, would be\nquite small. Conversely, a RED that is large yet acceptable with respect to the SNIa bound would clearly inhibit\nthe growth of LSS if it were redshifted to the past. However, a long-lived particle that decays sufficiently late as\nto avoid the LSS constraint could nevertheless contribute\nsubstantially to the RED today. In this case, the relevant\nconstraint would be the aforementioned CMB bound (see\nSection III A). Avoiding the CMB constraint requires the\nX particles to be very long-lived if they are to contribute\nappreciably to the RED today. Consider a big bang relic\nwith MkeV Y = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 (a 30 eV neutrino is an example of a particle with the necessary abundance) and\na very long lifetime, \u03c4yr = 2 \u00d7 109 . The decay products of this relic contribute \u03a9D h2 \u223c 0.1 and its properties are marginally consistent with the growth of LSS .\nIn addition, the decay products are produced sufficiently\nlate so as to contribute an unconstrained ISW perturbation at low multipole moments, peaking around l \u223c 10,\nand to change the angular diameter distance to the lastscattering surface by only \u223c 7% (see Figures 3 and 4 of\nKaplinghat et al., [43]). These effects cannot be ruled\nout by current CMB data. In Figure 2 we show the evolution of the RED including the decay products of this\nhypothetical, long-lived big bang relic.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Jim Kneller, Savvas Koushiappas, Bob Scherrer, and Gary Steigman for many insightful comments and helpful discussions.
