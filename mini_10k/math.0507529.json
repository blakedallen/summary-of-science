CARLINI AND F. RAPALLO\nAbstract. We study the geometric structure of the statistical models for\ntwo-by-two contingency tables. One or two odds ratios are fixed and the\ncorresponding models are shown to be a portion of a ruled quadratic surface\nor a segment. Some pointers to the general case of two-way contingency tables\nare also given and an application to case-control studies is presented.\n\n1. Introduction\nA two-way contingency table gives the joint distribution of two random variables\nwith a finite number of outcomes. If we denote by {0, . . . , I \u2212 1} and {0, . . . , J \u2212 1}\nthe outcomes of X1 and X2 respectively, the contingency table is represented by a\nmatrix P = (pij ), where pij is the probability that X1 = i and X2 = j. The table\nP is also called an I \u00d7 J contingency table, in order to emphasize that the variable\nX1 has I outcomes and the variable X2 has J outcomes.\nIn the analysis of contingency tables odds ratios, or cross-product ratios, are\nmajor parameters, and their use in the study of 2 \u00d7 2 tables goes back to the\n1970's. For an explicit discussion on this approach see, e.g., [Fie80].\nFor a 2 \u00d7 2 table of the form:\n\u0013\n\u0012\np00 p01\n(1)\np10 p11\nthere is only one cross-product ratio, namely:\np00 p11\n.\nr=\np01 p10\nIn the general I \u00d7 J case, there is one cross-product ratio for each 2 \u00d7 2 submatrix\nof the table. Thus, they have the form\npij pkh\npih pkj\n\nfor 0 \u2264 i < k \u2264 I \u2212 1 and 0 \u2264 j < h \u2264 J \u2212 1, see [Agr02, Chapter 2]. In this paper\nwe will consider the cross-product ratio and other ratios naturally defined.\nOdds ratios are used in a wide range of applications, and in particular in casecontrol studies in pharmaceutical and medical research. Following the theory of\nlog-linear models, the statistical inference for the odds ratios is made under asymptotic normality, see for example [BFH75]. More recently, some methods for exact\ninference have been introduced, see [Agr02] and [Agr01] for details and further\nreferences. For the theory about the Bayesian approach, see [Lin64].\nFrom the point of view of Probability and Mathematical Statistics, different\ndescriptions of the geometry of the statistical models for contingency tables are\npresented in [Col80, Chapter 2], and in [BFH75, Section 2.7], using vector space\n1\n\n\f2\n\nE. CARLINI AND F. RAPALLO\n\ntheory. An earlier approach to the geometry of contingency tables with fixed crossproduct ratio can be found in [FG70]. In the last few years, the introduction of\ntechniques from Commutative Algebra gave a new flavor to the geometrical representation of statistical models, as shown in, e.g., [PRW01a, Chapter 6], [PRW01b],\n[GHKM01] and [Sla04].\nIn this paper we use Algebraic and Geometric techniques in order to describe the\nstructure of some models for two-way contingency tables described through odds\nratios.\nWe first consider the case of 2 \u00d7 2 contingency tables of the form (1) with the\nconstraints pij > 0 for all i, j = 0, 1 and p00 + p01 + p10 + p11 = 1. If we allow some\nprobabilities to be zero, notice that the ratios are either zero or undefined. Thus\nwe restrict the analysis to the strictly positive case.\nIn a 2 \u00d7 2 table we consider the three odds ratios:\np00 p11\n,\nr\u00d7 =\np01 p10\np00 p10\nr|| =\n,\np01 p11\np00 p01\n.\nr= =\np10 p11\nThe meaning of the three odds ratios above will be fully explained in Section 4.\nLet r\u00d7 = \u03b12 , r|| = \u03b2 2 and r= = \u03b3 2 . For further use, it is useful to make explicit\nthe following identities. Considering r= and r|| , it is easy to check that:\np00\n(2)\n\u03b2\u03b3 =\n,\np11\nand\n\u03b2\np01\n(3)\n.\n=\n\u03b3\np10\nIn Section 2, we study the geometric properties of some statistical models for\n2 \u00d7 2 contingency tables. We consider models obtained by fixing two odds ratios,\nshowing that the model is represented by a segment in the probability simplex and\nstudying the behavior of the third ratio. In particular, an expression for tables with\nthree fixed ratios is derived. We also recover classical results about models with a\nfixed odds ratio. In Section 3, we give a glimpse of the general situation of I \u00d7 J\ncontingency tables. We focus our attention on 2 \u00d7 3 tables and we present some of\nthe difficulties arising in the general case. An application to case-control studies is\npresented in Section 4.\n2. Odds Ratios\nIn this section, we use basic geometric techniques to study the 2\u00d72 tables having\ntwo out of the three ratios r\u00d7 , r= and r|| fixed.\nWe consider a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix as a point in the real affine 4-space A4 . In particular,\nwith the notation of Equation (1), the pij 's are coordinates in A4 . A 2 \u00d7 2 table is\na matrix in the open probability simplex\nn\no\nX\n\u2206 = P = (pij ) \u2208 A4 :\npij = 1, pij > 0, i, j = 0, 1 .\nAs our goal is to describe odds ratios for tables, we may assume the ratios to be\nnon-zero positive numbers.\n\n\fGEOMETRY OF TWO-WAY CONTINGENCY TABLES\n\n3\n\nFixed the first two ratios\nr\u00d7 = \u03b12 and r|| = \u03b2 2 ,\nwe want to answer the following question:\nQ1: How can we describe the locus of tables having the assigned\ntwo ratios?\nand also\nQ2: What are the possible values of the third ratio?\nThese questions were posed in the AIM computational algebraic statistics plenary\nlecture by Stephen Fienberg in 2003. In this situation, some interesting comments\nabout treating questions Q1 and Q2 were also made.\nConsider the quadratic hypersurfaces of A4 :\nQ\u03b1 : \u03b12 p01 p10 = p00 p11\nand\nQ\u03b2 : \u03b2 2 p01 p11 = p00 p10 .\nNotice that a matrix in Q\u03b1 \u2229 Q\u03b2 is such that r\u00d7 = \u03b12 and r|| = \u03b2 2 as soon as\nthe ratios are defined. Hence, to answer the first question, it is enough to study\nQ\u03b1 \u2229 Q\u03b2 \\ Z ,\n\b\nwhere Z = P = (pij ) \u2208 A4 : p00 p01 p10 p11 = 0 .\nWe readily see that Q\u03b1 \u2229 Q\u03b2 contains the 2-dimensional skew linear spaces\np00 = p01 = 0 and p10 = p11 = 0\n\nand by general facts on quadrics (see [Har92, page 301]) we know that there exist\ntwo more 2-dimensional skew linear spaces, R and S, such that\nQ\u03b1 \u2229 Q\u03b2 = {p00 = p01 = 0} \u222a {p10 = p11 = 0} \u222a R \u222a S .\nManipulating equations we notice that a point in Q\u03b1 \u2229 Q\u03b2 \\ Z is such that\np00\np10\np11\n= \u03b12\n= \u03b22\np01\np11\np10\nand\np01\n1 p00\np10\n= \u03b22\n= 2\n.\np11\np00\n\u03b1 p01\nHence, R and S lie in the intersection of the two 3-dimensional spaces\n(\u03b1p10 \u2212 \u03b2p11 )(\u03b1p10 + \u03b2p11 ) = 0\nand\n\n1\n1\np00 )(\u03b2p01 + p00 ) = 0 ,\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are chosen to be positive. Only two out of the four resulting 2dimensional linear spaces lie in both Q\u03b1 and Q\u03b2 and these are R and S:\n1\nR : \u03b1p10 \u2212 \u03b2p11 = \u03b2p01 \u2212 p00 = 0 ,\n\u03b1\n1\nS : \u03b1p10 + \u03b2p11 = \u03b2p01 + p00 = 0 ,\n\u03b1\nwhich have parametric presentations\n1\nR = {(\u03b2u, u, \u03b2v, \u03b1v) : u, v \u2208 R} ,\n\u03b1\n(\u03b2p01 \u2212\n\n\f4\n\nE. CARLINI AND F. RAPALLO\n\n1\nS = {(\u03b2u, \u2212 u, \u03b2v, \u2212\u03b1v) : u, v \u2208 R} .\n\u03b1\nSumming all these facts up, we get\nProposition 2.1. Fix the ratios r\u00d7 = \u03b12 and r|| = \u03b2 2 . Then, a matrix has the\ngiven ratios if and only if it has the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b2u \u03b11 u\n\u03b2u \u2212 \u03b11 u\nor\n\u03b2v \u03b1v\n\u03b2v \u2212\u03b1v\nwith u, v non-zero real parameters.\n\nFinally, we have to intersect R and S with the probability simplex. As we can\nchoose \u03b1 and \u03b2 to be positive, we immediately see that S \u2229 \u2206 = \u2205 (there is always\na non-positive coordinate).\nP\nTo determine R \u2229 \u2206, notice that R \u2229 { pij = 1} is obtained by taking\nu=\n\n1 \u2212 (\u03b2 + \u03b1)v\n\u03b2 + \u03b11\n\nin the parametric presentation of R. Hence, we get\nProposition 2.2. Fix the ratios r\u00d7 = \u03b12 and r|| = \u03b2 2 . Then, a table has the\ngiven ratios if and only if it has the form\n!\n\u03b2\n1\n1 [1 \u2212 (\u03b2 + \u03b1)v]\n\u03b1\u03b2+1 [1 \u2212 (\u03b2 + \u03b1)v]\n\u03b2+ \u03b1\n\u03b2v\n\u03b1v\nwhere 0 < v <\n\n1\n\u03b1+\u03b2 .\n\nThis answers question Q1: fixed the two ratios, the tables with those ratios\ndescribe a segment in the probability simplex.\nRemark 2.3. In [BFH75, Section 2.7], a parametric description of the tables with\nr\u00d7 = 1 is written in the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nst\ns(1 \u2212 t)\n(4)\n.\n(1 \u2212 s)t (1 \u2212 s)(1 \u2212 t)\n\nLet us check that our parametrization contains this as a special case. In order to\ndo this, we will compute the marginal sums\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1\n1\n\u03b2[ \u03b2+1\n\u2212 v]\n[ \u03b2+1\n\u2212 v] 1 \u2212 (\u03b2 + 1)v\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7.\n(5)\n\uf8ed\n\u03b2v\nv\n(\u03b2 + 1)v \uf8f8\n\u03b2\n1\n1\n\u03b2+1\n\u03b2+1\n\nHence, the parametrizations in Equations (4) and (5) are just the same, simply let\n\u03b2\nt = \u03b2+1\nand s = 1 \u2212 (\u03b2 + 1)v.\n\nRemark 2.4. Suppose to fix r\u00d7 and to ask for a geometric description of the locus\nof tables with this ratio. Using Proposition 2.2 we can easily get an answer. For\neach value of r|| we get a segment of tables, and making r|| to vary this segment\ndescribes a portion of a ruled quadratic surface. Notice that, for r\u00d7 = 1, this is the\nresult contained in [BFH75, Section 2.7]. In particular, we recall that matrices such\nthat r\u00d7 is fixed form a so called Segre variety (i.e., in this case, a smooth quadric\nsurface in the projective three space). For more on this see, e.g., [GSS05].\n\n\fGEOMETRY OF TWO-WAY CONTINGENCY TABLES\n\n5\n\nAnswering question Q2 is just a computation, and we see that\n1 [1 \u2212 (\u03b2 + \u03b1)v]2\n,\n\u03b1\u03b2 + 1\nv\n\nr= =\n\nwhere r\u00d7 = \u03b12 and r|| = \u03b2 2 . Notice that, fixed r\u00d7 and r|| , the third ratio can freely\nvary in (0, +\u221e).\nRemark 2.5. We expressed r= as a function r= (\u03b1, \u03b2, v), and standard computations\nshow that this is an invertible function of v. In particular, we get\n1\np\nv=\n.\n\u03b1 + \u03b2 + (\u03b1\u03b2 + 1)r=\n\nThus, given r\u00d7 = \u03b12 , r|| = \u03b2 2 and r= , we have an explicit description of the unique\ntable with these ratios (use Proposition 2.2).\nClearly, completely analogous results hold if we fix the ratios r\u00d7 and r= .\nIf we fix the ratios r|| = \u03b2 2 , r= = \u03b3 2 and we argue as above, we get the following:\nProposition 2.6. Fix the ratios r|| = \u03b2 2 and r= = \u03b3 2 . Then, a table has the given\nratios if and only if it has the form\n!\n\u03b2\n[1 \u2212 (\u03b2 + \u03b3)v]\n\u03b3v\n\u03b2+ 1\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b2v\n\nwhere 0 < v <\n\n1\n\u03b2\u03b3+1 [1\n\n\u2212 (\u03b2 + \u03b3)v]\n\n1\n\u03b2+\u03b3 .\n\nAgain, a trivial computation yields:\n\u00132\n\u0012\n[1 \u2212 (\u03b2 + \u03b3)v]2\n\u03b2\n,\nr\u00d7 =\n\u03b2\u03b3 + 1\nv2\n\nand hence, fixed r= and r|| , the third ratio can freely vary in (0, +\u221e), see Remark\n2.5.\nRemark 2.7. In recent literature, there is an increasing attention to the geometrical\nstructure of probability models for contingency tables. In particular, in [Sla04,\nChapter 3] the author presents some results about the geometrical characterization\nof probability models for 2 \u00d7 2 contingency tables in terms of the cross-product\nratio and the conditional distributions. In the same work the connections between\nthe odds ratios and the classical log-linear and ANOVA-type representations of the\nprobability models are clearly stated. We remark that our notation slightly differs\nfrom the one used by A. Slavkovic in her Ph.D. dissertation.\nIn the same direction, in [LWJ04] the graphical visualization of joint, marginal\nand conditional distributions on the probability simplex for 2\u00d72 contingency tables\nis presented.\n3. The 2 \u00d7 3 case\nThe study of tables with more than two rows and columns would be of great\ninterest, but the complexity of the problem readily increases as we show in the 2 \u00d7 3\ncase.\nConsider the 2 \u00d7 3 matrix\n\u0013\n\u0012\np00 p01 p02\np10 p11 p12\n\n\f6\n\nE. CARLINI AND F. RAPALLO\n\nand define odds ratios as above for each 2 \u00d7 2 submatrix. We complete our previous\nnotation by adding a superscript to denote the deleted column, e.g.\np00 p02\n(1)\n.\nr=\n=\np10 p12\nAgain, we consider a matrix as a point in a real affine space, in this case A6 . Notice\nthat the ratios are well defined for matrices in A6 \\ Z, where Z denotes the set of\nmatrices with at least a zero entry.\nRelations among the ratios are the cause of the increased complexity of the\nhigher dimensional cases. For example, as we will see, two of the ratios can always\nbe freely fixed. But, as soon as three ratios are considered, constraints come in the\npicture.\nEasy calculations show that the following relations hold:\n(1)\n\n(0) (2)\n\nr|| r|| = r|| ,\n(0) (2)\n\n(1)\n\nr\u00d7 r\u00d7 = r\u00d7\nand also\n(0)\n\n(2) (1) \u22121\nr\u00d7 = r=\n(r= ) ,\n(1)\n\n(2) (0) \u22121\nr\u00d7 = r=\n(r= ) ,\n(2)\n\n(1) (0) \u22121\nr\u00d7 = r=\n(r= ) .\n\nThese relations, beside producing constraints on the numerical choice of the\nratios, lead to a much more complex geometric situation. We illustrate this by\nexhibiting some explicit examples (worked out with the Computer Algebra systems\nSingular and CoCoA). As references for the software, see [CoC04] and [GPS01].\nMore precisely, we fix some of the ratios and we describe the locus of matrices\nsatisfying these relations in\nX\n\u03a3\u25e6 = {P = (pij ) \u2208 A6 :\npij = 1} \\ Z ,\n\ni.e. the space of matrices with non-null entries of sum one. For the sake of simplicity,\nwe do not consider the positivity conditions defining the simplex.\nIn our geometric descriptions, we will slightly abuse terminology, e.g. we will\ncall a line in \u03a3\u25e6 a line in A6 not contained in Z; notice that our lines may have\nsome holes (i.e. the points of intersection with Z).\nWe start by considering the easiest case where two of the ratios are fixed. Already\nat this stage, a dichotomy arises and we have two different situations, as shown in\nthe following examples:\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(6)\n\nr\u00d7 = r\u00d7 = 1 ,\n\n(7)\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(2)\n(1)\n= r=\n= 1.\nr\u00d7 = r=\n= 1 or r=\n= r|| = 1 or r|| = r|| = 1 or r=\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nThe locus of matrices in \u03a3\u25e6 satisfying one of conditions (7) is a 3-dimensional\nvariety of degree 4, while condition (6) describes a 3-dimensional variety of degree\n3. Roughly speaking, the degree (see [Har92, page 16] and [Sha95, page 41]) is a\nmeasure of the complexity of the variety. For a surface in 3-space, for example,\nthe degree bounds the number of intersections with a line and, in a certain sense,\nmeasures how the surface is folded.\n\n\fGEOMETRY OF TWO-WAY CONTINGENCY TABLES\n\n7\n\nNext, we try to fix three of the ratios, for example:\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(8)\n\n(1)\nr\u00d7 = r=\n= r|| = 1 or r\u00d7 = r\u00d7 = r|| = 1 ,\n\n(9)\n\n(2)\nr\u00d7 = r\u00d7 = r=\n= 1,\n\n(10)\n\n(0)\n\n(1)\n\n(0)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\nr\u00d7 = 4, r\u00d7 = 3, r=\n= 2.\n\nThe locus of matrices in \u03a3\u25e6 satisfying one of conditions (8) is the union of two\nquadratic surfaces, while condition (9) gives a plane. Moreover, if we consider\nthe same ratios but we vary their values, as in (10), the locus of matrices is now\ndescribed by a single quadratic surface.\nFinally, a glimpse of the case of four fixed ratios:\n(0)\n\n(1)\n\n(0)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(11)\n\nr\u00d7 = r\u00d7 = r|| = r|| = 1 ,\n\n(12)\n\n(1)\n(2)\nr\u00d7 = r\u00d7 = r=\n= r=\n= 1,\n\nIn both cases, the locus is described by a curve as expected. But, condition (11)\nproduces the union of four lines, while condition (12) is satisfied by a single line in\n\u03a3\u25e6 .\nThe Computer Algebra systems Singular and CoCoA were used to compute\nprimary decompositions (giving the irreducible components of the loci) and Hilbert\nfunctions (giving the dimension and the degree of the loci).\n4. An application. The case-control studies\nTwo-by-two contingency tables are natural models for a large class of problems\nknown, in medical literature, as case-control studies. Let us consider a table coming,\ne.g., from the study of a new pharmaceutical product, or clinical test, designed for\nthe detection of a disease. This is an example of a case-control study.\nIn a case-control study there are two random variables. The first variable X1\nencodes the presence (level 1) or absence (level 0) of the disease. The second variable\nX2 encodes the result of the clinical test (level 1 if positive, level 0 if negative).\nThe joint variable (X1 , X2 ) has 4 outcomes, namely:\n(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) .\nIts probabilities form a 2 \u00d7 2 contingency table:\n\u0013\n\u0012\np00 p01\n.\np10 p11\n\nThe probabilities p00 and p11 are called the probability of true negative and of\ntrue positive, respectively. They correspond to the cases of correct answer of the\nclinical test. The probabilities p10 and p01 are called the probability of false positive\nand of false negative, respectively. They correspond to the two types of error which\ncan show in a case-control study. For example, the probability of false negative is\nthe probability that a diseased subject is incorrectly classified as not diseased.\nA perfect clinical test which correctly classifies all the subjects would have p01\nand p10 as low as possible, implying a large value of the odds ratio r\u00d7 . Therefore,\nthe odds ratio r\u00d7 measures the validity of the clinical test. In particular, when\n\n\f8\n\nE. CARLINI AND F. RAPALLO\n\nr\u00d7 = 1, the random variables are statistically independent. In our framework this\nmeans that, when r\u00d7 = 1, the result of the clinical test is independent from the\npresence or absence of the disease. Unless one obtains a large value of r\u00d7 , the\nclinical test is judged as non efficient. The odds ratio r\u00d7 is also called Diagnostic\nOdds Ratio (DOR) in medical literature.\nIn such a case-control study, two essential indices are the specificity and the\nsensitivity, defined as:\np00\nspecificity =\np00 + p01\nand\np11\nsensitivity =\n.\np10 + p11\nSpecificity is the proportion of true negative among the diseased subjects, while\nsensitivity is the proportion of true positive among the non-diseased subjects.\nStraightforward computations show that\nr\u00d7 =\n\nspecificity/(1 \u2212 specificity)\n.\n(1 \u2212 sensitivity)/sensitivity\n\nIn view of the definition above, it is easy to show that the relative magnitude\nof the sensitivity and specificity is measured by the odds ratio r|| . In fact one can\nshow that\n1\nsensitivity/(1 \u2212 sensitivity)\n=\n.\nspecificity/(1 \u2212 specificity)\nr||\nThe ratio above is called Error Odds Ratio (EOR).\nIn recent literature, the DOR and the EOR are relevant parameters for the\nassessment of the validity of a clinical test. They have received increasing attention\nin the last few years and a huge amount of literature has been produced. Hence,\nwe refrain from any tentative description and refer the interested reader to, for\nexample, [Kno01].\nThe meaning of the third ratio r= is not straightforward as explained in [BFH75,\nPage 21]. However its statistical meaning can be derived using Equations (2) and\n(3) shown in Section 1.\nFinally, we remark that the geometrical structure of the statistical models for\ncase-control studies is very simple. From the results in Section 2, one readily sees\nthat the models are segments or portions of ruled quadratic surfaces. Moreover,\nfrom a Bayesian point of view, Propositions 2.2 and 2.6 allow to compute the exact\nrange of the free odds ratio.\nAcknowledgement.
