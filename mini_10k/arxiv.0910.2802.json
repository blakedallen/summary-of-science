B. Lang\n\n1. Study with two dynamical CI fermions\nWe are presenting results of a hadron mass spectrum calculation with emphasis on possible\nidentification of excited states. The gauge configurations have been obtained with dynamical, mass\ndegenerate up and down quarks. For the fermions we used the chirally improved (CI) Dirac operator\nDCI [1, 2]. This is a parameterized fermion action of the form\n16\n\nDmn =\n\n\u2211 \u0393\u03b1 \u2211\n\n\u03b1 =1\n\n\u03b1\np\u2208Pm,n\n\nc\u03b1p \u220f Ul \u03b4n,m+p ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nl\u2208p\n\n\u03b1 symbolizes paths from site m to n. Inserting the ansatz in the Ginsparg-Wilson (GW)\nwhere Pm,n\nequation, truncating the length of the contributions (to, e.g., distance 4), and comparing the coefficients, leads to a set of algebraic equations, which can be solved (norm minimization). We used\na truncated action with terms involving coupling to neighboring sites within a 34 hypercube plus\nsome extra terms, giving rise to several hundred terms. Part of our definition of the Dirac action\nis one step of stout smearing [3] of the gauge configuration. The eigenvalues of DCI are closer\nto the unit circle (where the eigenvalues of exact GW-operators are located) than those of, e.g.,\nthe improved Wilson operator for the same lattice size (in lattice units). However, (lattice) chiral\nsymmetry is still violated, albeit to a smaller amount. The gauge action used is a tadpole-improved\nL\u00fcscher-Weisz action.\nThe dynamics was implemented with the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm with Hasenbusch mass preconditioning (with two pseudofermions) and a chronological inverter utilizing the\nmixed precision technique [4]. Details and parameters of the action and the methods of simulation\ncan be found in [5]. There one also finds a discussion of equilibration and determination of lattice\nspacing and AWI (PCAC) mass of the quarks.\nThe analysis presented here is based on three ensembles of gauge configurations for lattice\nsize 163 \u00d7 32, with parameters summarized in Table 1.\n\nset\nA\nB\nC\n\n\u03b2LW\n4.70\n4.65\n4.58\n\na m0\n-0.050\n-0.060\n-0.077\n\ntMD\n600\n1200\n1200\n\nconfigs.\n100\n200\n200\n\na[fm]\n0.151(2)\n0.150(1)\n0.144(1)\n\nm\u03c0 [MeV]\n525(7)\n470(4)\n322(5)\n\nmAWI [MeV]\n42.8(4)\n34.1(2)\n15.3(4)\n\nTable 1: Overview of the three ensembles of gauge configurations on which this analysis is based.

For further details see [5].\n\n2. Variational analysis and hadron interpolators\nIn the variational method [6] one studies the cross-correlation matrix of several lattice operators Oi with the correct quantum numbers. Inserting a complete set of states (and assuming a\n2\n\n\fExcited hadrons in n f = 2 QCD\n\nC. B. Lang\n\ndiscrete spectrum, which is always the case for finite lattices) one finds a superposition of exponentially decaying contributions,\nC(t)i j = hOi (t)O j (0)i = \u2211h0|Oi |nihn|O\u2020j |0ie\u2212t Mn .\n\n(2.1)\n\nn\n\nAssuming that we have a complete enough set of operators the solution of the generalized eigenvalue problem\nC(t)~vi = \u03bbi (t)C(t0 )~vi\n(2.2)\nallows one to disentangle the individual states and the corresponding energies,\n\n\u03bbi (t) \u221d e\u2212t Mi 1 + O e\u2212t \u2206Mi\n\n\u0001\u0001\n\n.\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe eigenvectors are \"fingerprints\" of the states which one may follow through several time slices\nin order to ensure that the state has been identified consistently (see also the discussion in [7].)\nIn order to increase the number of hadron operators and to improve the correlation signal\nquality we built interpolating fields with different smearing of the quark fields. We used Jacobi\nsmeared quark sources, e.g., us \u2261 Ss u, with an hermitian smearing operator Ss as discussed in [5],\nwith parameters adjusted to produce two different smearing widths, a wide source (s = w, radius\n0.55 fm) and a narrow source (s = n, radius 0.27 fm).\nWe also used derivative quark sources as discussed in [8], e.g., sources like u\u2202k = Dk Sw u,\nwhere k denotes the spatial direction of the covariant derivative\nDi (~x,~y) = Ui (~x, 0)\u03b4 (~x + \u00ee,~y) \u2212Ui (~x \u2212 \u00ee, 0)\u2020 \u03b4 (~x \u2212 \u00ee,~y) .\n\n(2.4)\n\nThe interpolating field operators are built on (in the 3D time slices) 3 times HYP smeared\ngauge configurations [9] with smeared valence quark sources us , ds (and the strange quark ss ). We\nregularly shift the center of the sources when passing from one configuration to the next in order to\nimprove decorrelation.\nFor the meson operators we use bilinears. Depending on the quantum numbers this allows for\nsets of operators with different Dirac structure and varying spatial extent. As an example, for the\npseudoscalar meson we have\nun \u03b35 dn , un \u03b35 dw , uw \u03b35 dw , un \u03b3t \u03b35 dn , un \u03b3t \u03b35 dw , uw \u03b3t \u03b35 dw ,\nu\u2202i \u03b3i \u03b35 dn , u\u2202i \u03b3i \u03b35 dw , u\u2202i \u03b3i \u03b3t \u03b35 dn , u\u2202i \u03b3i \u03b3t \u03b35 dw , u\u2202i \u03b35 d\u2202i , u\u2202i \u03b3t \u03b35 d\u2202i .\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe nucleon interpolators have the form\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(i)\n(i)\n(i)\nN (i) = \u03b5abc \u03931 ua uTb \u03932 dc \u2212 dbT \u03932 uc\n(i)\n\n(2.6)\n\n(i)\n\nwith the choices (\u03931 , \u03932 ) = (1, C\u03b35 ), (\u03b35 , C), and (i1, C\u03b34 \u03b35 ) for i = 1, 2, 3 respectively, where u,\nd denote again smeared quarks. The \u2206 interpolator is\n\u0001\nO\u2206,k = \u03b5abc ua uTb C \u03b3k uc ,\n\nk = 1, 2, 3 .\n\nprojected to spin 23 .

As discussed in [5], in the multi-operator (variational) analysis at\nsmall pion masses the backwards running (in time) pion limits the observation range for the excited\nstate. This can be cured by a larger time-size; however, for physical pion masses we expect that\none needs at least Nt = 64 for lattice spacing a = 0.15 fm or Nt = 128 for a = 0.075 fm.\nWe choose the fit interval of the exponential fit to the non-leading eigenvalues based on the\nwindow where the backwards running contribution is not yet dominant and get the excited pion\nsignal in Fig. 1 (left). We include in this plot (as in some of the other figures) the results for\npartially quenched data, i.e., where the valence quark masses are larger than the sea quark masses.\n0++ : a0 (980), a0 (1450). The isovector, scalar meson has led to controversial results in lattice\nsimulations [10, 11]. Most quenched studies found a ground state extrapolating towards the mass\nof the a0 (1450) for smaller valence quark masses. Results for (two) dynamical quarks seem to\nlead to smaller masses, compatible with an extrapolation towards the a0 (980). However, for these\nmasses the energy values are close to those of an expected \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b72 channel in s-wave (mass of \u03b72\nestimated [12]). Fig. 1 (r.h.s.) exhibits the situation.\nWhen also plotting partially quenched values, we find an interesting effect for the ensemble C\nwith the smallest sea quark mass. The partially quenched data do not smoothly extrapolate to the\ndynamical point. An explanation has been offered in [13]: the partially quenched states may couple\nto pairs of pseudoscalars (composed of valence and sea quarks), leading to unphysical contributions\nthat cancel in the fully dynamical case.\nAlso, we find a broad range of values for the extracted energy levels for different sets of\ncontributing interpolators. The issue, whether the a0 ground state is dominantly a tetraquark state,\nis still not settled (see [14]).\n1\u2212\u2212 : \u03c1 \u00b1 (770), \u03c1 \u00b1 (1450). In Fig. 2 (l.h.s.) we show the results for ground state and first excitation in the \u03c1 -channel. For a better signal we allow for different operator combinations for the\nexcited states.

The agreement with the experimental values is surprisingly good in view\nof the \u03c1 being a resonance; however, the decay pions are in relative p-wave and due to the given\nlattice size the necessary extra unit of momentum stabilizes the vector meson.\nWe find more admixtures of still higher excitations, and for some combinations of operators\nwe can identify a 3rd energy level compatible with the \u03c1 (1700).\nOur data in the exotic 1\u2212+ channel is too noisy to allow extraction of a ground state energy\nlevel.\n1++ : a1 (1260) and 1+\u2212 : b1 (1235). In both channels we see reliable signals only when including derivative interpolators (cf. the discussion for the quenched case in [8]). The error bars are\nsomewhat larger for 1+\u2212 than for 1++ , where they are roughly \u00b150 MeV. In both cases a linear extrapolation points towards the experimental value (within the errors). The mass difference\nmlatt,b1 \u2212 mlatt,a0 is approximately 200 MeV.\n2++ : a2 (1320). In this channel two representations of the cubic group couple: E and T2 . Again\ninterpolators involving derivative sources are necessary, e.g., \u03b5i jk u\u2202i \u03b3 j dn . We find good signals\nonly when we include several interpolators and thus this is a case where the variational method is\ncrucial. Fig. 2 (r.h.s.) demonstrates the situation. The results for the independent analysis of both\nrepresentations are compatible, although T2 appears to extrapolate better to the physical value.\n2\u2212+ : \u03c02 (1670) and 2\u2212\u2212 : \u03c12 (1940)?. Qualitatively the situation is like for the 2++ channel.

Only recently, and at this conference [16, 17], there\nare results showing an energy level extrapolating towards smaller masses. That study was based on\noptimizing combinations of interpolators with several widths, like in this and earlier work [18].\nThere was some hope that introducing the quark dynamics might improve the situation. Our\npresent analysis does not strengthen that hope (Fig. 3). Indeed our new results for dynamical\nfermions are similar to earlier quenched results [15]. We want to emphasize that it is important\nin this case to simultaneously find both excitations (the Roper and the state extrapolating to the\nN(1710)) in order to have a convincing identification. Both excited states are too high in our\nresults which might indicate that the given volume is too small for baryon excitations.\n1\u2212\n2\n\n: N(1535), N(1650). We clearly identify two states but cannot quantify their mass splitting\ndue to large errors.\n3+\n2\n\n\u2212\n\n: \u2206(1232), \u2206(1600) and 32 : \u2206(1700). In the positive parity sector (see Fig. 4) we find that\nthe ground state is closer to the experimental values, as compared to the quenched results. The\nexcited state is clearly seen, but again too high, maybe due to volume squeezing. The ground state\nin the negative parity sector is clearly identified and extrapolates towards the experimental mass.\n6\n\n\fExcited hadrons in n f = 2 QCD\n\nC. B. Lang\n\nThus, while our meson results look quite good, the excited baryons come out too high. Improvement of the signal might be obtained with larger lattices and possibly extending the set of\ninterpolator (see, e.g., [19]). Further results for the axial charge of baryons including baryons with\nstrangeness are discussed in [20].\nAcknowledgment: This work has been supported by Austrian FWF DK W1203-N08 and\nGerman DFG project SFB/TR-55.
