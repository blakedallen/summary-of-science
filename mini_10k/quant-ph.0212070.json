The first one relies on a controllable interaction between the electron\nspins (see, for example, [1, 2]). In such proposals a point contact gate switches interaction\nbetween the neighboring qubits. It was shown, in particular, that the switchable Heisenberg\ninteraction alone can provide the universal quantum computation. The main advantage\nof the controllable interaction proposals is the high clock speed in the GHz range. The\nmain technical challenge in such proposals is the precise control of the interaction. It was\nestimated that the interaction constant must be controllable with the accuracy 10\u22124 . Also\nthe time of turning on (off) the interaction must be about 10-100 fs. The other challenge is\n\n\f2\na possible decoherence caused by the point contact.\nThe second stream relies on the permanent interaction between spins (see, for example\n[3, 4]). In such proposals electromagnetic pulses provide implementation of quantum computation. The main advantage of these proposals is the use of well developed technique of\nelectromagnetic pulses, and the absence of the electro-static gates. The main technical challenge for these proposals is the creation of a large gradient of the magnetic field. The other\nchallenge is the decoherence caused by the sources of the magnetic field. The latest development of the micropattern wires technique provides the magnetic field gradients 105 \u2212 106\n\nT/m [5, 6]. Even greater gradients \u223c 107 T/m are expected if the micropattern wires will\n\nbe replaced by the ferromagnetic plates [7]. This development provides new ground for the\nelectromagnetic pulse proposals. The field gradient 106 T/m corresponds to the magnetic\nfield difference 0.03 T for the distance 30 nm. In turn, the difference between the electron\nspin resonance (ESR) frequencies \u2206\u03c9/2\u03c0 for this distance will be 840 MHz.\nFor the electromagnetic pulse proposals the most convenient interaction between qubits\nis, definitely, the Ising interaction [8, 9]. Normally, the Ising interaction is considered as\nnon-typical for solids. However, if the frequency difference between the neighboring spins\nis greater than the spin-spin interaction, the spin-spin interaction (Heisenberg or dipoledipole) becomes effectively the Ising interaction. This effect is well-known in liquid nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (NMR) where the scalar coupling, which is equivalent to the Heisenberg\ninteraction, becomes the Ising interaction due to the chemical shift of the NMR frequencies\n[10, 11]. The same effect takes place for the heteronuclear dipole-dipole interaction in\nsolids. We should note, that the long-range dipole-dipole interaction in a spin chain can be\neffectively suppressed if the angle between the chain and the external magnetic field equals\nto the magic angle [10, 12].\nWe believe that the large field gradients provide the resurgence of the interest to the Ising\nspin quantum computer. If the interaction between the neighboring paramagnetic spins is of\nthe order of 10MHz and the ESR frequency difference is \u2206\u03c9/2\u03c0 = 840 MHz, the spin-spin\ninteraction becomes effectively the Ising interaction. As an example, we consider phosphorus\nimpurity donors in silicon. In the first approximation, the exchange interaction constant for\nthe donor electrons separated by the distance r is given by [13]\nJ(r) = 0.8\n\ne2 \u0010 r \u00115/2\nexp(\u22122r/a0 ).\n\u01eba0 a 0\n\n\f3\nHere \u01eb is the dielectric constant of silicon, a0 is the effective radius of the impurity atom, and\ne is the electron charge. Taking \u01eb = 12, a0 = 3 nm, and r = 30 nm, we obtain J = 5 MHz.\nCurrently, there are three main approaches for implementation of quantum logic gates\nusing the electromagnetic pulses. The first approach is developed in experiments with liquid\nstate NMR quantum computer (see, for, example, [10]). To provide the conditional logic\nthis approach takes advantage of the spin-spin interaction during the time-interval between\nthe electromagnetic pulses. Thus, the Rabi frequency \u03a9 of the pulses [\u03a9 = \u03b3B1 , where \u03b3\nis the gyromagnetic ratio and B1 is the amplitude of the radio frequency (rf) field] is much\ngreater than the Ising interaction constant J, but the clock speed of the gate is J.\nThe second approach is intended to increase the clock speed by application of more\npowerful strongly modulated pulses which average to zero all undesired interactions between\nspins but drive the desired quantum transitions. The first experiments indicate the almost\ntenfold increase of the clock speed [14].\nThe third approach is based on the application of the selective electromagnetic pulses with\nthe Rabi frequency \u03a9 < J (see, for example, [12, 15, 16]). These pulses drive a resonant spin\ndepending on the states of its neighbors. The clock speed in this approach is determined by\nthe Rabi frequency, \u03a9. While the third approach has a clear disadvantage in the clock speed,\nits advantage is the small power of the pulses: for a given angle of the spin rotation the\npower of the pulse is inversely proportional to its duration. The small power of the pulses is\nnot important for the room temperature NMR quantum computer but can be important for\na scalable solid-state quantum computer, which is expected to operate at low temperature.\nBesides, the powerful pulses can contribute to the decoherence rate.\nBased on the above remarks, we believe that the development of the theoretical background for the quantum logic gate implementation using the selective electromagnetic pulses\nin the Ising spin quantum computer is an important task. In this paper, we present a scheme\nfor implementation of universal quantum gates on an arbitrary superposition of quantum\nstates in the Ising spin quantum computer.\nThe paper is organized as follows. The general problem to be solved is formulated in\nSec. II. The Ising spin quantum computer model is described in Sec. III. The probability\nerrors are minimized in Secs. IV and V. The phase errors are minimized in Secs. VI and VII.\nThe universal gates are tested numerically in Sec. VIII by the exact numerical modeling of\nquantum dynamics of the system. In Sec. IX we summarize our results.\n\n\f4\nII.\n\nFORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe most important quantum algorithms exploit the property of quantum interference.\nIn the result of implementation of these algorithms a small amount of \"useful\" states is\namplified while all other states are suppressed. Hence, in order to implement a quantum\nlogic a strict control over both moduli and phases of the amplitudes in superposition of states\nin the register of a quantum computer is necessary. For example, the quantum Control-Not\n(CN) gate CNi,k transforms a superpositional wave function as\nCNideal\ni,k\n\nL \u22121\n2X\n\nj=0\n\nBj |nL\u22121 . . . ni . . . nk . . . n0 i =\n\nL \u22121\n2X\n\nj=0\n\nBj |nL\u22121 . . . ni . . . ni \u2295 nk . . . n0 i,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u2295 means sum modulo 2, nm = 0, 1, and L is the number of qubits. The CN gate for\nremote qubits can be implemented using a series of CN gates for the neighboring qubits,\nCNi+1,i or CNi,i+1 . (See Sec. VIII of this paper or, for example, Ref. [17].) Moreover, any\nquantum logic operation between remote qubits can be divided into elementary logic gates\nbetween neighboring qubits. Hence, in order to implement the universal quantum logic, it\nis sufficient to construct only the universal quantum gates between adjacent qubits.\nUsually, in real quantum systems, instead of Eq. (1) one has\nCNreal\ni,k\n\nL \u22121\n2X\n\nj=0\n\nBj |nL\u22121 . . . ni . . . nk . . . n0 i =\n\nL \u22121\n2X\n\nj=0\n\nB \u2032 j |nL\u22121 . . . ni . . . ni \u2295 nk . . . n0 i,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the coefficients B \u2032 j in the right-hand side of Eq. (2) are slightly different from the\ncoefficients Bj in the right-hand side of Eq. (1). This introduces the error in the quantum\nalgorithm. A source of the error can be external, like noise, or internal, like unwanted\ntransitions driven by pulses of a protocol.\nIn this paper, we will consider only the latter errors. We will present protocols for\nimplementation of basic quantum logic operations between the neighboring qubits which\nwork for an arbitrary superposition of states in the Ising spin quantum computer. We use\nthese operations to implement the CN gate between the end qubits, CN0,L\u22121 of the spin\nchain, and estimate the phase and probability errors.\n\n\f5\nIII.\n\nISING SPIN QUANTUM COMPUTER\n\nThe simplest Hamiltonian for the Ising spin chain placed in an external magnetic field\ncan be represented as\nHn = \u2212\n\nL\u22121\nX\nk=0\n\n\u03c9k Ikz \u22122J\n\nL\u22122\nX\nk=0\n\nz\nIkz Ik+1\n\u2212\n\nL\u22121\n\u03a9n X \b \u2212\nIk exp [\u2212i (\u03bdn t + \u03c6n )] + h.c. = H0 + Vn (t). (3)\n2\nk=0\n\nHere ~ = 1, Ikz is the operator of the z component of kth spin 1/2, Ik\u00b1 = Ikx \u00b1 Iky , \u03c9k is\nthe Larmor frequency of the kth spin, J is the interaction constant between the neighboring\nspins, \u03a9n is the Rabi frequency (frequency of precession around the resonant transversal\nfield in the rotating frame), \u03bdn is the frequency of the pulse, and \u03c6n is the phase constant of\nthe nth pulse, below called \"phase\". The Hamiltonian (3) is written for one nth rectangular\nrf pulse. Below we omit the index n which indicates the pulse number.\nIn the interaction representation, the solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be written\nin the form\n\u03a8(t) =\n\nX\n\nCp (t)|pi exp(\u2212iEp t),\n\n(4)\n\np\n\nwhere Ep and |pi are, respectively, the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian\nH0 .\nUnder the condition \u03a9 < J \u226a \u03c9 the pulse effectively affects only one kth spin in the\nchain [17] whose frequency \u03c9k is close (near-resonant transition) or equal (resonant transition) to the frequency of the pulse, \u03bd. In this approximation, the system of coupled\ndifferential equations for the coefficients Cp (t) splits into 2L\u22121 independent groups.

(8). In order to organize, for example, the transition |4i \u2192 |6i,\nassociated with the flip of the first (middle) spin, we apply the \u03c0 pulse [\u03a9\u03c4 = \u03c0 in Eq.\n(6)] with the resonant frequency \u03bd = E6 \u2212 E4 = w + \u03b4\u03c9. We also have the near-resonant\ntransition (or transition with small detuning from the exact resonance condition) |0i \u2192 |2i\nwith the detuning \u22062,0 = E2 \u2212 E0 \u2212 \u03bd = 2J which creates the unwanted state with the\nprobability [see Eq. (6)]\nP2,0\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03a9\nsin\n=\n\u03bb2,0\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bb2,0 \u03c0\n2\u03a9\n\n\u0013\u00152\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\n\f7\nwhere \u03bb2,0 =\n\nq\n\n\u220622,0 + \u03a92 =\n\n\u221a\n\n4J 2 + \u03a92 . In order to suppress this transition we take the\n\nRabi frequency in the form\n\u03a9k = \u221a\n\n2J\n,\n4k 2 \u2212 1\n\nk = 1, 2, . . . .\n\n(10)\n\n(See the 2\u03c0k method in Ref. [12].) Then the argument of sinus in Eq. (9) turns to zero,\nand the unwanted near-resonant transition |0i \u2192 |2i is completely suppressed.\nV.\n\nGENERALIZED 2\u03c0k METHOD\n\nNext, we will show that one cannot suppress all possible near-resonant transitions using\nonly one pulse. Since detunings for different transitions are different, one \u03c0 pulse in general\ncase creates a relatively large error. In this section, we will demonstrate how to compensate this error using additional correcting pulse. This procedure can be characterized as a\ngeneralized 2\u03c0k method since this protocol suppresses all near-resonant transitions for all\nquantum states in a superposition.\nSuppose that we have three quantum states, |0i, |4i, and |5i in a register of a quantum\ncomputer. Using the resonant pulse we produce the resonant transition |0i \u2192 |2i by flipping\nthe first qubit. We also have two near-resonant transitions: |4i \u2192 |6i with the detuning\n\u22066,4 = \u22122J and |5i \u2192 |7i with \u22067,5 = \u22124J. In order to suppress both transitions the Rabi\nfrequency \u03a9 should satisfy the system of two equations\n\u221a\n\u22066,4\n= 4k 2 \u2212 1,\n\u03a9\n\n\u221a\n\u22067,5\n= 4K 2 \u2212 1,\n\u03a9\n\nwhere k and K must be integer numbers. Dividing the second equation over the first one\nand taking into consideration that |\u22067,5 /\u22066,4 | = 2 we obtain the relation K 2 = 4k 2 \u2212 3/4.\nFrom this equation one can see that if k is integer then K cannot be an integer number.\nHence, if we suppress, for example, the transition |4i \u2192 |6i, then we get an error for the\ntransition |5i \u2192 |7i, and vice versa.\n\nTo proceed, we introduce the following notations. The pulse Pi00 indicates the \u03c0 pulse\n\nwith the frequency \u03bdi00 which is resonant for the transition associated with the flip of ith spin\nwhen both its neighbors are in the states |0i. In a similar way, we define the pulses Pi10 and\n\nPi11 . The pulse P100 will be resonant, for example, for the transitions |0i \u2192 |2i and |2i \u2192 |0i\n[see Eq. (8)]. We define Ti00 as the transition (not necessarily resonant) associated with the\n\n\f8\nflip of ith spin when both its neighbors are in the states |0i. For example, the pulse P100\n\ngives rise to the resonant transitions T100 and two types of the near-resonant transitions, T110\n\nand T111 . In general case of an arbitrary number of qubits, one notation, for example, Ti00 ,\nmeans the transitions for all quantum states with the identical groups | . . . 0i+1 0i 0i\u22121 . . . i\nand | . . . 0i+1 1i 0i\u22121 . . . i. So, now we discuss the types of transitions, but not the transitions\n\nbetween definite states. We should note that \u03bdi10 = \u03bdi01 , so that we use the same notation,\nPi10 , for the pulses Pi10 and Pi01 .\nNow we continue the discussion on the 2\u03c0k method. All near-resonant transitions Ti00\nand Ti11 , caused by the pulse Pi10 , can be suppressed using only one pulse, since the moduli\nof detunings are the same and equal to \u2206 \u2261 2J. In this case, we take\n\u221a\n\u2206\n= 4k 2 \u2212 1,\n\u03a91\n\n(11)\n\nwhere k is the integer number.\nAs was shown above, pulses Pi00 and Pi11 generate errors because the detunings for transitions Ti00 , Ti10 and Ti11 are different. To correct this error, we suppress the unwanted\ntransition Ti11 for the pulse Pi00 and the unwanted transition Ti00 for the pulse Pi11 with\nthe moduli of detunings \u22062 \u2261 2\u2206 = 4J by the 2\u03c0k method with the Rabi frequency \u03a92\nsatisfying the expression\n\u22062\n=\n\u03a92\n\nq\n\n4k22 \u2212 1.\n\n(12)\n\nBelow we take k2 = k and \u03a92 = 2\u03a9, \u03a91 = \u03a9, where \u03a9 is a parameter. Thus, we choose the\nvalue of the Rabi frequency for the pulses Pi11 and Pi00 twice larger than the value of the\nRabi frequency for the pulse Pi10 .\nThe pulses Pi00 and Pi11 with the parameters (12) generate errors in the result of the\ntransitions Ti10 . In Appendix A, we demonstrate that the additional pulse with the frequency\n\u03bdi10 can be used to correct this error. The real and imaginary parts of the amplitude of the\ncreated unwanted state are corrected by the proper choice of the duration and the phase\nof the correcting pulse. The correcting pulse does not generate errors since the moduli of\ndetunings for unwanted transitions, Ti00 and Ti11 , are the same, so that these transitions can\nbe suppressed simultaneously.\n\n\f9\nVI.\n\nUNWANTED PHASES\n\nIn spite of the fact that all pulses described above are probability-corrected, they generate\nunwanted phases which should also be compensated by the protocol. In this section, we\ncalculate all unwanted phases which appear in the quantum computer in the result of action\nof the rf pulses.\nEven in the case when all unwanted near-resonant transitions are suppressed, the unwanted phases appear because for definite transitions \u2206pm 6= 0 in Eqs. (6) and (7). The\nproblem to compensate those phases becomes complicated, since each pulse generates different phases for different states. In this section we will show that the unwanted phases\ncan be compensated by choosing the proper phases of the pulses of the protocol. Each logic\noperation requires its own set of phases of the pulses. However, if one has a set of phasecompensated universal gates, introduced below, one can realize a quantum logic using these\ngates as building blocks.\nFurther analysis is conducted in terms of the probability-corrected pulses, Qmn\ni (\u03c6), where\nm, n = 0, 1, i = 0, 1, . . . L \u2212 1, and \u03c6 is the phase of the pulse. The pulse Q10\ni (\u03c6) indicates\n\none \u03c0 pulse. It coincides with the pulse Pi10 , introduced above. The combined probability11\n00\n11\ncorrected pulse, Q00\ni (\u03c6) [or Qi (\u03c6)], consists of one \u03c0 pulse Pi , (Pi ), and one correcting\n\npulse. The correcting pulse does not implement quantum logic, it only removes unwanted\nstates from the register of quantum computer.\nIn the Table I we present the phases (see Appendix B) acquired by different states (which\ncan be in a superposition in a register of quantum computer) generated in the result of the\ndifferent kinds of the probability-corrected pulses, Qmn\ni (\u03c6).\n\nVII.\n\nPHASE AND PROBABILITY-CORRECTED UNIVERSAL GATES\n\nIn the Ising spin quantum computer the parameters which allow one to compensate the\nunwanted phases are the phases of the rf pulses. From Eq. (6) one can see that the phase\n\u03c6 of the pulse changes the phase of the wave function. In this section we provide the phase\nand probability correct protocols for realization of universal quantum gates on arbitrary\nsuperposition of states in the Ising spin scalable quantum computer.\nOur task is to construct phase-corrected quantum gates from the elementary probability-\n\n\f10\nstate\n\nacquired phase\nQ01\ni (\u03c6)\n\nQ00\ni (\u03c6)\n\nQ11\ni (\u03c6)\n\n| . . . 0i+1 0i 0i\u22121 . . . i\n\n\u2212\u03b8\n\n\u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03c6 + \u03b3 \u2217\n\n\u2212\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b3\n\n| . . . 0i+1 1i 0i\u22121 . . . i\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u03c0/2 + \u03c6 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2217\n\n\u03b8+\u03b3\n\n| . . . 1i+1 0i 0i\u22121 . . . i \u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03c6\u2217 \u03c0 + \u03b8/2 + \u0398 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8/2 \u2212 \u0398\n| . . . 1i+1 1i 0i\u22121 . . . i \u03c0/2 + \u03c6\u2217 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8/2 \u2212 \u0398 \u03c0 + \u03b8/2 + \u0398\n| . . . 0i+1 0i 1i\u22121 . . . i \u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03c6\u2217 \u03c0 + \u03b8/2 + \u0398 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8/2 \u2212 \u0398\n| . . . 0i+1 1i 1i\u22121 . . . i \u03c0/2 + \u03c6\u2217 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8/2 \u2212 \u0398 \u03c0 + \u03b8/2 + \u0398\n| . . . 1i+1 0i 1i\u22121 . . . i\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u03b8+\u03b3\n\n\u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2217\n\n| . . . 1i+1 1i 1i\u22121 . . . i\n\n\u2212\u03b8\n\n\u2212\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b3\n\n\u03c0/2 + \u03c6 + \u03b3 \u2217\n\nTABLE I: Phases generated by the probability-corrected pulses, Qmn\ni (\u03c6).

These transitions are associated with the flip of the resonant kth\nspin whose the Larmor frequency, \u03c9k , is close to the frequency of the external field, \u03c9k \u2248 \u03bd.\nIn general case, the near-resonant transitions generate large errors. In the preceding sections\nthe procedure is described how to suppress all these transitions. However, since the external\nrf field affects all spins in the system, there are non-resonant transitions associated with\nflips of other non-resonant k \u2032 th spins. Because the non-resonant transitions |p\u2032 i \u2192 |m\u2032 i have\n\nlarge detuning, Ep\u2032 \u2212 Em\u2032 \u2212 \u03bd \u223c \u03b4\u03c9|k \u2212 k \u2032 |, their probabilities are small and proportional to\n\u03bc2 /|k \u2212 k \u2032 |2 , where [17, 18]\n\n\u03bc = (\u03a9/2\u03b4\u03c9).\n\n(27)\n\nFor typical parameters \u03bc \u223c 10\u22124 . Since in the system there are only non-resonant transitions\n(and all near-resonant transitions are suppressed), for a definite protocol \u03bc is the only\nparameter which defines the errors in our quantum computer. This is demonstrated in the\nnumerical simulations below.\nIn order to demonstrate the action of the logic gates on superpositional states, described\nin this paper, we simulated the exact quantum dynamics [17] of the system with the Hamiltonian (3) during implementation of the CN gate (1) between the edge qubits of the spin\nchain, CN0,L\u22121 , where the 0th qubit is the control qubit and the (L \u2212 1)th qubit is the target\nqubit. (In a similar way one can implement any other CN gate CNi,j , where i, j = 0, . . . , L\u22121\nand i 6= j, for example CNL\u22121,0 .)

From comparison of Fig. 1(a) with Fig. 1(b) one can see that decreasing twice\nthe value of \u03bc leads to decrease of the error in the phases of all states by the factor two.\nThis supports the fact, mentioned in the beginning of this section, that for our protocols \u03bc\nis the only parameter which defines the errors in the quantum computer. Physically, this\nmeans that only the non-resonant transitions contribute to the errors and all near-resonant\n\n\f17\n\nL=5\nL=7\nL=9\n\n0.1\n\nPhase error\n\n0.08\n\n0.06\n\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\n0\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nNumber of pulses\nFIG. 2: The phase error as a function of the number of pulses for four values of L. \u03b4\u03c9 = 104 , other\nparameters are the same as in Figs. 1(a,b).\n\ntransitions are completely suppressed.\nIn Fig. 2 we plot the phase error as a function of time. The phase error is defined as a\nthe maximum max|\u03c6j \u2212 \u03a6|, j = 0, . . . , 2L \u2212 1. In Figs. 1(a,b) the phase error is equal to\nthe distance between the two dashed lines. During implementation of each elementary CN\ngate between the neighboring qubits (using 12 pulses for intermediate qubits) the phases\nof different states of the superposition are different, but after implementation of each gate\nCNi,i+1 or CNi+1,i the phases are equalized, since our CN gates between the neighboring\nqubits are probability and phase-corrected. That is why in Fig. 2 the phase error is plotted\nwith the interval of 12 pulses for intermediate qubits and 9 or 10 pulses for the edge qubits.\nAs follows from the results of the calculations, the phase error is mostly generated by the\n11\npulses Q00\nj and Qj . From Fig. 2 one can see that the phase error grows linearly with the\n\nnumber of these pulses. For larger number of qubits in the chain the error is larger, because\nthe implementation of the protocol requires larger number of pulses.

Other parameters are the same as in Fig. 3.\n\nrelatively simple model with basic features common for many solid-state scalable quantum\ncomputer proposals.\nWe solved the general problems which one should face working with superpositional states\nin different types of quantum computers characterized by the constant (not switchable) interaction between qubits (for example in Kane's quantum computer [13]). Since the transition\nfrequencies required to flip the jth qubit in the states | . . . 0j+1 qj 0j\u22121 . . . i, | . . . 1j+1 qj 0j\u22121 . . . i\n(or | . . . 0j+1qj 1j\u22121 . . . i), and | . . . 1j+1qj 1j\u22121 . . . i (qj = 0, 1) are different, one inevitably will\ncreate an error by flipping the jth qubit. For an Ising spin quantum computer we corrected\nthis error using additional correcting pulse which removes unwanted states from the register\nof quantum computer, created in the result of the unwanted transitions.\nAnother important problem solved in this paper is a minimization of the phase errors.\nEven in the situation, when the probability errors are minimized, each pulse of the protocol\nproduces different phases for different quantum states of the superposition. In the Ising spin\n\n\f20\nquantum computer the phases can be equalized by proper choice of phases of the rf pulses.\nEach protocol (for CN gate, one-qubit rotation, and others) has its own set of phases.\nThe phase and probability errors studied in this paper, decrease when the Rabi frequency,\n\u03a9, decreases or the frequency difference between the neighboring qubits, \u03b4\u03c9, increases. In\nparticular, all errors tend to zero when \u03a9 \u2192 0 or \u03b4\u03c9 \u2192 \u221e.\nOur simulations show that the phase error less than 0.1 radians for the studied protocols\ncan be achieved for the ratio \u03b4\u03c9/J > 104 . In our example with phosphorus impurity donors\nin silicon (see Introduction) the ratio \u03b4\u03c9/J is about 170. We will mention three ways to\nincrease this ratio. The first way is to increase \u03b4\u03c9 using even greater gradients of the\nmagnetic field suggested in [7]. The second way is to decrease the interaction constant J.\nThis can be easily achieved by either increase of the distance between the impurity atoms\nor using the atoms with smaller effective radius. However decrease of J will reduce the\nclock speed of a quantum computer below MHz region. The third way is to develop more\nsophisticated sequences of electromagnetic pulses, which further suppress the phase error\ncaused by non-resonant transitions.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are thankful to T.

We\n\napply the pulse Pi11 with the frequency \u03bdi11 = \u03c9i \u2212 2J, where \u03c9i is the Larmor frequency\n\nof the ith qubit.

In this case\nthe quantities \u03b1, \u03b8, f , and g, defined below, are the functions of only one parameter k.

The second and third equations\nin (A10) define, respectively, the phase \u03c611\nc and the duration of the correcting pulse required\nto correct the error.\nIf one considers the transitions generated by the pulse Pi11 in the opposite direction\n| . . . 1i+1 1i 0i\u22121 . . . i \u2192 | . . . 1i+1 0i 0i\u22121 . . . i, one should just change the signs as [see Eqs.

After this transformation both sides of the second Eq. (A10) change their sign,\nso that the expressions for the parameters of the correcting pulse, \u03c611\nc and \u03b2, do not change.\nHence, one can suppress both unwanted transitions, | . . . 1i+1 0i 0i\u22121 . . . i \u2192 | . . . 1i+1 1i 0i\u22121 . . . i\nand | . . . 1i+1 1i 0i\u22121 . . . i \u2192 | . . . 1i+1 0i 0i\u22121 . . . i, simultaneously.\n\nFor the transitions generated by the pulse Pi00 one should change the sign of \u2206, so that\n\nthe expression for the phase \u03c600\nc of the correcting pulse takes the form\n\u03c600\nc = \u03b8 + \u03a6 + \u2206t0 + \u0398,\n\n(A12)\n\nwhere \u0398 is defined in the first equation (A10).\nFor k > 1 the value of \u03b2 is small and negative. We take the duration of the pulse\n\u03b2 \u2217 = \u03b2 + \u03c0, so that Cm (t) in Eq. (A8) changes its sign, and Cp (t) is again equal to zero.\nAfter the correcting pulse one has\nCm (t) = \u2212 exp(\u2212i\u03b8/2 \u2212 i\u0398),\n\nCp (t) = 0.\n\n(A13)\n\nOne can suppress the non-resonant transitions, Ti00 and Ti11 generated by the correcting\npulse with moduli of detunings \u2206, choosing the value of \u03a9c satisfying 2\u03c0k-condition,\np\n2\u03b2 \u2217\n\u03bbc \u03c4c\n\u03c4c =\n= \u03c0kc ,\n\u03bbc = \u22062 + \u03a92c ,\n,\n(A14)\n2\n\u03a9c\n\nwhere kc is the integer number.

The CN gate in a homogeneous spin chain without phase correction can\nbe implemented by the following sequence\n10\n00\n00\n11\n10\n00\n11\nQ11\na (\u03c68 )Qa (\u03c67 )Qa (\u03c66 )Qb (\u03c65 )Qa (\u03c64 )Qa (\u03c63 )Qa (\u03c62 )Qb (\u03c61 ).\n\n(C1)\n\n\f24\nThis sequence can be described as follows: (in terms of the transformations for the amplitudes, we note that the phases of the various states will not be equal) (i) a controlled flip of\nqb if both of its neighbors are in the \"1\" state, (ii) a Not operation on qa , (iii) a controlled\nflip of qb if both of it's neighbors are in the \"0\" state, and finally (iv) another Not operation\non qa which returns it to its initial state.\nThe transformation resulting from (C1) is (we indicate in this Appendix only four relevant\nqubits of the spin chain),\n\n|0000i \u2192 ei[\u2212\u03b3\u2212\u03b8/2+\u0398\u2212\u03c62 +\u03c66 ] |0000i,\n|0001i \u2192 ei[+\u03b3+\u03b8/2\u2212\u0398\u2212\u03c62 +\u03c66 ] |0001i,\n|0010i \u2192 ei[+\u03b3+\u03b8/2\u2212\u0398\u2212\u03c63 +\u03c67 ] |0010i,\n|0011i \u2192 ei[\u2212\u03b3\u2212\u03b8/2+\u0398\u2212\u03c63 +\u03c67 ] |0011i,\n|0100i \u2192 ei[\u03c0/2+\u03b3+3\u03b8/2\u2212\u0398+\u03c63 +\u03c65 \u2212\u03c66 ] |0110i,\n|0101i \u2192 ei[\u03c0/2+\u03b3+\u03b8/2+\u0398+\u03c61 +\u03c62 \u2212\u03c66 ] |0111i,\n|0110i \u2192 ei[\u03c0/2\u2212\u03b3\u22123\u03b8/2+\u0398+\u03c62 \u2212\u03c65 \u2212\u03c67 ] |0100i,\n|0111i \u2192 ei[\u03c0/2\u2212\u03b3\u2212\u03b8/2\u2212\u0398\u2212\u03c61 +\u03c63 \u2212\u03c67 ] |0101i,\n|1000i \u2192 ei[\u2212\u03b3\u2212\u03b8/2+\u0398\u2212\u03c63 +\u03c67 ] |1000i,\n|1001i \u2192 ei[+\u03b3+\u03b8/2\u2212\u0398\u2212\u03c63 +\u03c67 ] |1001i,\n|1010i \u2192 ei[+\u03b3+\u03b8/2\u2212\u0398\u2212\u03c64 +\u03c68 ] |1010i,\n|1011i \u2192 ei[\u2212\u03b3\u2212\u03b8/2+\u0398\u2212\u03c64 +\u03c68 ] |1011i,\n|1100i \u2192 ei[\u03c0/2\u2212\u03b3\u2212\u03b8/2+3\u0398+\u03c64 +\u03c65 \u2212\u03c67 ] |0110i,\n|1101i \u2192 ei[\u03c0/2+\u03b3+\u03b8/2+\u0398+\u03c61 +\u03c63 \u2212\u03c67 ] |1111i,\n|1110i \u2192 ei[\u03c0/2+\u03b3+\u03b8/2\u22123\u0398+\u03c63 \u2212\u03c65 \u2212\u03c68 ] |1100i,\n|1111i \u2192 ei[\u03c0/2\u2212\u03b3\u2212\u03b8/2\u2212\u0398\u2212\u03c61 +\u03c64 \u2212\u03c68 ] |1101i.\n\n(C2)\n\nHowever, when this sequence of gates is used, it is impossible to make the phases on\nall of the states equal.
