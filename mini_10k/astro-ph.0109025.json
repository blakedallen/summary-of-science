Complementing these tests by the observational data at larger (cosmic\nmicrowave backgroud anisortopy (CMBA)) and smaller (distribution of Ly\u03b1 clouds) scales\nopens the way to a straightforward determination of the cosmological parameters in simplest\ndark matter (DM) models. We argue that such a 'minimal data set' is free from systematic\neffects and can indicate quite precisely the parameters of spatially flat mixed DM model with\na positive cosmological constant and no cosmic gravitational waves.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThree lessons from the galaxy cluster physics are often implied in building-up the true cosmology\ndirectly from observations:\n\u2022 the cluster abundance test (the famous \u03c38 argument or cluster mass/temperature function\nfrom data at z \u223c 0),\n\u2022 the cluster power spectrum (the distribution of clusters in space),\n\u2022 the cluster evolution test (the cluster abundance vs redshift).\nWhile the latter still requires better statistics and cluster mass determination, the first two\nare considered today as the most precise cosmological tests related straightforwardly to the\nlinear density perturbation field which gave the birth to LSS in the Universe (see the review\npapers at this Conference).\nA good concordance of the power spectrum of galaxy clusters in the range k \u2208 (0.03, 0.2)h/Mpc\nreconstructed from different optical and X-ray data (e.g. the talk of P.Schuecker at this Conference and refs therein) evidences a low level of possible systematic uncertainties in cluster data\nand encourages to apply the \u03c72 minimization method for the restoration of the cosmological\nparameters in simplest DM models.\nCertainly, few additional tests have to be taken into account to cover a broader range of\nscales and, thus, to improve the stability of the method and perform a more comprehensive\nanalysis. However, the danger may arise here in possible introduction of the unclear systematics\nbrought by additional tests, that often makes the result of the analysis dependent on a set of\nthe selected data.\n\n\f2\n\nMinimal Data Set\n\nThe determination of cosmological parameters from some geometrical tests and numerous LSS\nobservations has been carried out in many papers. Though the results are always stable for the\nprediction of a small matter abundance (\u03a9m < 1), the concrete values of \u03a9m and other cosmic\nparameters leave something to be desired depending strongly on both a family of the theoretical\nmodels chosen (the number of free parameters) and a set of observations taken for the analysis.\nUnder such a situation it is tempting to form the current 'minimal data set' suffering less from\nthe systematic effects, and to see if the selected data are mutually in agreement implying the\nsame cosmological parameters.\nThe modern status of observational cosmology prompts to clearly indicate at least three\nscale regions which have to be taken into account for the problem to be solvable:\n\u2022 very large scales (\u223c 1000h\u22121 Mpc),\n\u2022 LSS scales (\u223c 10 \u2212 100h\u22121 Mpc), and\n\u2022 small (sub-megaparsec) scales.\nFortunately, all these three levels can be suggested today by the 'most trustable' available data\nrelated to the primordial density perturbation field throgh simple linear integrals:\n\u2022 the first group \u2013 by COBE 4-year data,\n\u2022 the second \u2013 by a group of LSS data selected below, and\n\u2022 the third \u2013 by data on the power and distribution of Ly\u03b1 clouds.\nIf the first and third groups are monopolic (few observational points in each group) destining\njust to stabilize the spectrum amplitudes in the asymptotic scale regions, then the central\n(second) group is the most important for the analysis allowing for a subtle 'fine tuning' of the\nresult. This group contains a bulk of observational points determining both the spectral slopes\nand amplitudes within the LSS scales. Novosyadlyj et al. 1 suggested the following seven data\npoints (in the second group) which meet common agreements in literature and can be thought\nof as 'most trustable' and accurate:\n\u2022 the \u03c38 \u2212 \u03a9m relation found by cluster abundance at z \u223c 0 (one point),\n\u2022 the mean peculiar velocity of galaxies in a sphear of radius 50h\u22121 Mpc (one point),\n\u2022 the Abell-ACO cluster power spectrum in scales k \u2208 (0.03, 0.2)h/Mpc (three effective\ndegrees of freedom),\n\u2022 the amplitude and position of the first acoustic peak in \u2206T /T spectrum (two points).\nThese data points have been shown to be self-consistent (excluding some points from the searching procedure results only in a change of the best-fit parameter values within the range of their\ncorresponding standard errors, see Sections 3,4). More of that, some other data (e.g. the evolution of cluster number density, see Section 4) can be added to these seven points with a no\nchange of the result.\nBelow we present the cosmological models and constrain the parameters using only this\n'minimal data set'. The reported analysis does not include observations of distant supernovae,\ngalaxy power spectra, a bulk of the CMB data (except the two mentioned points for the location\nand position of the first acoustic peak and the COBE normalization), the local measurements\nof Hubble constant, the age of globular clusters, the evolution tests and some other data. It is\ninteresting to see if and how our result confronts with these 'other' observational tests mentioned.\n\n\f3\n\nThe Model and Determination of Its Parameters\n\nThe usual cosmological paradigm \u2013 a scale free power spectrum of scalar primordial perturbations\nwhich evolve in a multicomponent medium to form the large scale structure of the Universe \u2013 is\ncompatible with the observed LSS and CMBA. Most inflationary scenarios predict a scale free\nprimordial power spectra of scalar density fluctuations (P (k) \u223c kn with arbitrary n) as well as\ngravity waves which contribute to the power spectrum of CMB temperature fluctuations ( \u2206T\nT )l\nat low spherical harmonics. But models with a minimal number of free parameters, such as the\nscale invariant (n = 1) standard cold DM model or the standard mixed (cold + hot) DM model\nare excluded by observational data.\nBetter agreement between theory and observations can be achieved in models with a larger\nnumber of parameters: cold dark matter (CDM) or mixed dark matter (MDM) with baryons,\na tilted primordial power spectra, spatial curvature, cosmological constant, and a tensor contribution to the CMB anisotropy power spectrum. However, to ensure a better stability and\nconvergence of the minimization method on the basis of the 'minimal data set', the total number\nof free parameters in the model should not be large (currently, not exceeding ten).\nOne way to improve the standand MDM is an introduction of cosmic gravity waves (CGW).\nHowever, the direct approach (just introducing the tensor mode while keeping the \u039b-term vanishing) is not effective (see Mikheeva et al. 2 ): the best-fit model normalized by \u03c38 and COBE\ndata requires too much hot matter (\u03a9\u03bd \u2265 0.2) and too low first acoustic peak (inconsistent\nwith Ly\u03b1 and CMBA observations). Another way \u2013 the introduction of cosmological constant\nwithout CGW \u2013 appears more powerful.\nNovosyadlyj et al.1 have performed such an analysis for \u039bMDM spatially flat cosmological model (\u03a9\u039b + \u03a9m = 1) without tensor mode, also neglecting a possible effect of the early\nreionization which could reduce the amplitude of the first acoustic peak in the CMB anisotropy\nspectrum. The reason for the restriction of flat models is strongly motivated by the results\nfrom the BOOMERANG experiment 3 , whereas neglecting the CGW and reionization is mainly\ntechnical: the extraction of these parameters in models with non-zero \u039b-term would require\nmore accurate experimental data than those available today.\nAmong the free cosmological parameters one is discrete (the number of species of massive\nneutrinos) and six are continuous within the following ranges:\n\u2022 N\u03bd = 1, 2, 3 , the number of massive neutrino species,\n\u2022 n \u2208 (0.7, 1.4), the tilt of primordial spectrum,\n\u2022 \u03a9m \u2208 (0, 1), the abundance of total matter,\n\u2022 \u03a9\u03bd \u2208 (0, 0.4), the abundance of hot matter,\n\u2022 \u03a9b \u2208 (0, 0.2), the abundance of baryons,\n\u2022 h \u2208 (0.4, 0.8), the Hubble constant in units 100kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ,\n\u2022 bCl \u2208 (1, 5), the bias of galaxy cluster distribution.\nThe abundance of cold dark matter and cosmological \u039b-term are found from the equations\n\u03a9c = \u03a9m \u2212 \u03a9\u03bd \u2212 \u03a9b and \u03a9\u039b = 1 \u2212 \u03a9m , respectively; the bias of the cluster power spectrum with\nrespect to the dark matter distribution is supposed to be linear and scale independent in the\nrange of scales considered.\nThe method for detecting cosmological parameters from the 'minimal data set' has been\ntested for the stability with help of the constructed mock sample of observational data. The\nonly pourly determined parameter (from the LSS data alone) turned out to be the baryonic\n\n\fabundance. To fix \u03a9b with better accuracy we have added a single geometrical test in our\nanalysis: the Big Bang nucleosysthesis constraint, \u03a9b h2 = 0.019\u00b10.0024. With such an addition\nthe method reveals as very stable and finds all the parameters of 'true' model whenever possible.\nThe best-fit model with the minimum of \u03c72 (when all parameters are free) is presented in\nthe first line of Table 1. The rest eleven lines display some other best-fit models (with some of\nthe seven parameters fixed) which have got within the 1\u03c3 contour (from the first-line model).\nIn all the models \u03c72min is in the range\nNF \u2212\n\n2NF \u2264 \u03c72min \u2264 NF +\n\np\n\np\n\n2NF\n\nwhich is expected for a Gaussian distribution with NF degrees of freedom (the number of observational points minus the number of free model parameters).\nTable 1: Cosmological parameters of \u039bMDM models without cosmic gravity waves (the free/fixed parameters are\ngiven with/without standard errors)\n\nNo\n\nN\u03bd\n\n\u03c72min\n\nn\n\n\u03a9m\n\n\u03a9\u03bd\n\n\u03a9b\n\nh\n\nbcl\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n4.63\n4.80\n5.07\n\n1.12\u00b10.10\n1.13\u00b10.10\n1.13\u00b10.10\n\n0.41\u00b10.11\n0.49\u00b10.13\n0.56\u00b10.14\n\n0.059\u00b10.028\n0.103\u00b10.042\n0.132\u00b10.053\n\n0.039\u00b10.014\n0.039\u00b10.014\n0.040\u00b10.015\n\n0.70\u00b10.12\n0.70\u00b10.13\n0.69\u00b10.13\n\n2.23\u00b10.33\n2.33\u00b10.36\n2.45\u00b10.37\n\n4\n5\n\n1\n1\n\n5.27\n4.65\n\n1.12\u00b10.09\n1.12\u00b10.10\n\n0.51\u00b10.07\n0.39\u00b10.05\n\n0.074\u00b10.041\n0.058\u00b10.026\n\n0.053\u00b10.003\n0.037\u00b10.002\n\n0.60\n0.72\n\n2.43\u00b10.26\n2.19\u00b10.23\n\n6\n7\n8\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n12.23\n10.17\n8.80\n\n1.07\u00b10.09\n1.10\u00b10.09\n1.12\u00b10.09\n\n1.00\n1.00\n1.00\n\n0.116\u00b10.086\n0.177\u00b10.086\n0.219\u00b10.084\n\n0.118\u00b10.027\n0.099\u00b10.022\n0.085\u00b10.019\n\n0.40\u00b10.05\n0.44\u00b10.05\n0.47\u00b10.05\n\n3.15\u00b10.39\n3.10\u00b10.38\n3.07\u00b10.38\n\n9\n\n1-3\n\n6.54\n\n1.04\u00b10.10\n\n0.30\n\n0.000\u00b10.005\n\n0.038\u00b10.013\n\n0.71\u00b10.12\n\n2.25\u00b10.19\n\n10\n11\n\n1\n3\n\n6.18\n10.43\n\n1.00\n1.00\n\n0.45\u00b10.12\n1.00\n\n0.042\u00b10.032\n0.159\u00b10.069\n\n0.038\u00b10.014\n0.075\u00b10.021\n\n0.71\u00b10.13\n0.51\u00b10.07\n\n2.44\u00b10.31\n3.23\u00b10.35\n\n12\n\n1-3\n\n6.92\n\n1.00\n\n0.30\n\n0.000\u00b10.010\n\n0.034\u00b10.009\n\n0.75\u00b10.10\n\n2.25\u00b10.20\n\n4\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nAs it is seen from Table 1, the considered observational data on LSS of the Universe can be\nexplained by a flat \u039bMDM inflationary model with a tilted spectrum of scalar perturbations\nand vanishing tensor contribution. The best fit parameters are: N\u03bd = 1, n = 1.12 \u00b1 0.10,\n\u03a9m = 0.41 \u00b1 0.11, \u03a9\u03bd = 0.059 \u00b1 0.028, \u03a9b = 0.039 \u00b1 0.014 and h = 0.70 \u00b1 0.12. The CDM\ndensity parameter is \u03a9c = 0.31 \u00b1 0.15 and \u03a9\u039b is considerable, \u03a9\u039b = 0.59 \u00b1 0.11.\nIf all parameters are free (line 1) the model with one sort of massive neutrino provides the\nbest fit to the data. However, there are only marginal differences in \u03c72min for N\u03bd = 1, 2, 3 (lines\n1,2,3, respectively), therefore, with the given accuracy of the data we cannot currently conclude\nwhether \u2013 if massive neutrinos are present at all \u2013 their number is one, two, or three.\nThe spectral index is close the Harrison-Zel'dovich and coincides with the COBE prediction.\nThe neutrino matter density is about the baryon abundance: \u03a9\u03bd \u223c \u03a9b \u223c 10% of \u03a9m .\nSurprisingly, the prediction of model parameters from the 'minimal data set' is consistent\nwith observations of the nearby and distant SNIa, the age of globular clusters, and the existence\n\n\fof rich galaxy clusters at z \u2265 0.5. However, the comparison with galactic power spectra creates\na problem since different systematics in galaxy catalogues and a scale-dependent bias because\nof non-linear clustering of galaxies at small scales.\nNotice, that the value of Hubble parameter found from the LSS tests is consistent with local\nmeasurements of Hubble constant. It is interesting to see that the value of Hubble constant\nunticorrelates with the total matter abundance (lines 4,5): roughly, the production of both\nfactors remains constant, \u0393 \u2261 \u03a9m h \u2243 0.3. Note, that without hot matter (\u039bCDM) \u0393 \u2243 0.22\n(see lines 9,12) in concordance with other results.\nFurthermore, increasing the number of massive neutrino species from 1 to 3 leads to an\nincrease of \u03a9\u03bd from 0.06 to 0.13 and to a decrease of \u03a9\u039b from 0.59 to 0.44 (lines 1,2,3). The\ncorrelation between \u03a9\u03bd and \u03a9m can be approximated at the 'maximum likelihood ringe' by the\nfollowing equation:\n\u03a9\u03bd \u2243 1.3\u03a92m \u2212 0.44\u03a9m + 0.023\nThere are some other interesting models staying within the 1\u03c3 range form the best-fit first\nline. Among them are the matter dominated models with zero \u039b-term (lines 6,7,8): all these\nmodels require rather high abundance of the hot matter (up to 22% for three sorts of massive neutrino) and extremely low value of the Hubble constant (h < 0.5) which is in obvious\ndisagreement with the local SNIa measurements.\nThe models with low \u03a9m \u223c 0.3 (lines 9,12) fit the observational data somewhat less good\nthan the best model (\u2206\u03c72min \u2243 2) but all predictions are still within the 1\u03c3 contour. Such model\nprefers a high Hubble parameter (h>\n\u223c 0.7) and no massive neutrinos. Obviosly, it is the standard\n\u039bCDM.\nConcerning the perfectly scale invariant primordial power spectrum (lines 10,11,12), these\nmodels prefer \u039bMDM (with a somewhat lower neutrino content than in the best-fit model in line\n1) if the remaining parameters are initially free (line 10), and the \u039bCDM if the matter content\nis initially fixed as low (line 12). As for the matter dominated model with n = 1 (line 11), it is\njust the standard MDM with a low Hubble parameter, h \u2243 0.5, practically coinciding with the\nline 8.\nIf the hot component is eliminated from the very\np beginning or \u03a9\u03bd is fixed at the small\nvalue defined by the lower limit of the neutrino mass \u03b4m2\u03bd = 0.07 from the Super-Kamiokande\nexperiment, \u03a9\u03bd = 7.4\u00d710\u22124 N\u03bd /h2 , we obtain the best-fit value for the matter density parameter\n\u03a9m \u2243 0.39 \u00b1 0.11 and the Hubble constant h = 0.62 \u00b1 0.12.\nThe errors in the best fit parameters presented in Table 1 are the square roots of the diagonal\nelements of the covariance matrix. More information about the accuracy of the determination of\nparameters and their sensitivity to the data used can be obtained from the contours of confidence\nlevels presented in Fig. 1. These contours show the confidence regions which contain 68.3%\n(solid line), 95.4% (dashed line) and 99.73% (dotted line) of the total probability distribution\nin the two dimensional sections of the six-dimensional parameter space of \u039bMDM models, if the\nprobability distribution is Gaussian.\nAs one can see in Fig.1a the iso-\u03c72 surface is rather prolate from the low-\u03a9m - high-n corner\nto high-\u03a9m - low-n. This indicates some degeneracy in n \u2212 \u03a9m parameter plane, which can be\nexpressed by the following equation which roughly describes the 'maximum likelihood ridge' in\nthis plane within the 1\u03c3:\np\nn \u03a9m \u2243 0.73\nA similar degeneracy in the \u03a9\u03bd \u2212 \u03a9m plane in the range 0 \u2264 \u03a9\u03bd \u2264 0.17, 0.25 \u2264 \u03a9m \u2264 0.6\n(Fig.1c) was already discussed above. The both degeneracies have clear physical explanation.\nThe rest contours are quasi-spherical and consistent with the Gaussian character of the errors.\nOne important question is how each point of the data influences the final result. To estimate\nthis we have excluded some data points from the searching procedure. Excluding any part of\n\n\fFigure 1: The likelihood contours (solid line - 68.3%, dashed - 95.4%, dotted - 99.73%) of the tilted \u039bMDM model\nwith N\u03bd = 1 and parameters from Table 1 (line 1) in the different planes of n \u2212 \u03a9m \u2212 \u03a9\u03bd \u2212 \u03a9b \u2212 h space. The\nparameters not shown in a given diagram are set to their best fit values.\n\n\fFigure 2: The observed Abell-ACO power spectrum (filled circles) and the theoretical spectra predicted by tilted\n\u039bMDM models with parameters taken from Table 1 (N\u03bd = 1).\n\nobservable data results only in a slight change of the best-fit values of n, \u03a9m , and h within\nthe ranges of their corresponding standard errors. This indicates that the data are mutually in\nagreement implying the same cosmological parameters (within the error-bars). Concerning the\nparameter \u03a9\u03bd , a very important is the small scale constraint: the Ly\u03b1 tests reduce the hot dark\nmatter content from \u03a9\u03bd \u223c 0.22 to \u223c 0.07. The rest tests stabilize the value of \u03a9\u03bd within its still\nconsiderable errorbars.\nThe most crucial test for the baryon content is of course the nucleosynthesis constraint (LSS\nalone does not determine \u03a9b ). Its \u223c 6% \u2212 1\u03c3-accuracy safely keeps \u03a9b h2 near its median value\n0.019. The parameter \u03a9b in turn is only known to \u223c 36% accuracy due to the large errors\nof other experimental data (reduced to the uncertainty in Hubble constant). The obtained\naccuracy of h (\u223c 17% from the 'minimal data set') is better than the one assumed from direct\nlocal measurements (\u223c 23% only).\nThus, all the data points used in the analysis are non-contradictory and mutually selfconsistent: all they are important for searching the best-fit cosmological parameters.\nFinally, let us emphasize an important spectrum property. The experimental Abell-ACO\npower spectrum and the theoretical predictions for some best-fit models are shown in Fig. 2.\nAs we see the best-fit spectra do not have any pecularity at the scale k \u223c 0.05h/Mpc. More\nof that, the theoretical spectra bend evidently at larger scale! This can create a problem for\n\u039bMDM: if better data on the spatial distribution of galaxy clusters will confirm the presence of\nthe bent/feature in the power spectrum the whole \u039bMDM paradigm will be in trouble. A way\nout could be that the real spectrum bent occurs at larger scale, kbent \u2264 0.05h/Mpc, as indicated\nby the \u039bMDM models. (Some observational data hint on such a possibility, e.g. Miller and\nBatuski 4 ). Then, what is the physical reason of the spectrum feature at k \u223c 0.05h/Mpc? Does\nit have a baryonic nature (the modulation of the power spectrum by the acoustic waves existing\nin the early Universe in the baryon-radiation plasma)? If so, then the fraction of baryons should\n\n\fbe higher than we think today, \u03a9\u03a9mb > 10 \u2212 15%. All these questions only stress the importance\nof further cluster investigations.\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nThe experimental data set with a minimal current level of systematic effects can be used to\nconstrain successfully the cosmological parameters of simple dark matter models.\nThe 'minimal data set' includes (i) the LSS constraints based on galaxy cluster observations\n(the Abell-ACO power spectrum 5 , the density fluctuation amplitude \u03c38 derived from the mass\nfunction of nearby 6 and distant 7 clusters, the mean peculiar velocity of galaxies in a sphere\nof radius 50h\u22121 Mpc 8 , the position and amplitude of the first acoustic peak in the angular\npower spectrum of CMBA 3 ), (ii) the small-scale constraints on the amplitude and tilt of the\npower spectrum obtained from Ly\u03b1 clouds at z=2-3 9,10 , (iii) the large-scale constraint on the\namplitude of the power spectrum obtained from the COBE data 11 , and (iv) the Big Bang\nnucleosynthesis constraint 12 .\nThe results of the determination of the cosmological parameters for spatially flat \u039bMDM\nmodel without cosmic gravity waves by the \u03c72 minimization method are listed as follows:\n\u2022 The \u039bMDM model with the best-fit parameters from the first line in Table 1 matches the\nobservational data set best:\n\u2217 one sort of massive neutrino is slightly preferable, however the data do not distiguish\nmodels with one, two or three massive neutrino species within 1\u03c3 c.l.;\n\u2217 the tilt of the power spectrum is consistent with the Harrison-Zel'dovich one;\n\u2217 the abundance of matter and cosmological constant is roughly half-to-half,\n\u2217 the abundance of hot matter is close to the abundance of baryons and consists 10 \u2212 15%\nof the total matter abundance,\n\u2217 the Hubble constant fits the local SNIa measurements.\n\u2022 Fixing a low \u03a9m = 0.3 the \u039bCDM model without hot matter and with high h>\n\u223c 0.7 matches\nthe observational data set best.\n\u2022 Fixing a high \u03a9m = 1 the standard MDM model with high abundance of hot matter (up\nto \u03a9\u03bd = 0.22) and extremely low h \u2264 0.5 matches the observational data set best. The\nstandard CDM/MDM models with h > 0.5 are ruled out at very high confidence level,\n99.99/95% c.l. respectively.\n\u2022 Raising fixed Hubble parameter decreases the total matter abundance keeping the production of both factors approximately constant: \u0393 \u2261 \u03a9m h \u2243 0.3. The same procedure for a\nfixed low \u03a9m universe (\u039bCDM) keeps the shape parameter at the level \u0393 \u2243 0.22.\n\u2022 Increasing the number of massive neutrino species raises the abundances of both the hot\nand total matter, the corresponding correlation between \u03a9\u03bd and \u03a9m (when the rest parameters are fixed to their best-fit values) is approximated by the equation:\n\u03a9\u03bd \u2243 1.3\u03a92m \u2212 0.44\u03a9m + 0.023.\n\u221a\n\u2022 Increasing the tilt of power spectrum raises the value of \u039b-term: n \u03a9m \u2243 0.73.\n\u2022 For all best-fit models\n\u2217 the biasing parameter of rich galaxy clusters remains in the range bCl \u2243 2.2 \u2212 3.3, the\n1\u03c3 confidence interval is 1.5 \u2264 bCl \u2264 3.5;\n\u2217 the power spectra of matter density perturbations do not have percularity at k \u223c\n0.05h/Mpc (a better understanding of the cluster power spectrum break or baryonic feature\nat k \u223c 0.05h/Mpc is required).\n\n\f\u2022 The best-fit models constrained by the 'minimal data set' are\n\u2217 consistent with the age of globular clusters, observations of nearby and distant SNIa,\nevolution of the comoving number density of clusters with redshift;\n\u2217 inconsistent with galactic power spectra (a better understanding of the non-linear biasing\nand different systematics of galaxy catalogues is required).\n\u2022 The \u039b-term is strongly indicated by the 'minimal data set' based on cluster observations.\nHowever, still a low accuracy of the present observational data does not allow\n\u2217 to constrain the set of cosmological parameters sufficiently,\n\u2217 to discriminate between the \u039bMDM and \u039bCDM models (even at 1\u03c3 c.l.).\nIt may well be that the DM nature is more complex than just the \u039bMDM without CGW.\nThe progress in both, the LSS theory and observations based on galaxy clusters helps to solve\nthe DM problem, the key problem of the cosmological model.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was partly supported by INTAS (97-1192) and RFBR (01-02-16274a).
