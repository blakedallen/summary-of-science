Physics of spin-1 hadron is an unexplored topic in the high-energy region\nalthough spin-1/2 physics has been well investigated in the last decade. It is important\nto test our knowledge of hadron spin structure in a quite different field of spin physics.\nWe discuss tensor structure functions, which do not exist for the spin-1/2 nucleon,\nin lepton scattering and in hadron reactions such as the polarized proton-deuteron\nDrell-Yan process.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nHigh-energy spin physics is entering into a new era in the sense that the difference\nbetween a naive quark-model prediction and experimental data is now roughly\nunderstood and that much detailed studies are in progress with the completion of\nthe RHIC facility. So far, spin-structure studies have been focused on the spin1/2 nucleon. For higher-spin hadrons, we know that different spin physics exists\nsuch as the tensor structure in the deuteron. In order to test our understanding\nof the hadron structure, it is important to investigate other spin quantities. In\nthis sense, spin-1 hadrons, for example the deuteron, should be suitable for future\ninvestigations.\nIn this paper, the present status is explained for the deuteron spin structure in\nthe high-energy region. First, polarized electron-deuteron scattering is discussed\nbriefly in connection with the deuteron spin physics. In particular, new polarized\nstructure functions are introduced. Then, as an alternative method, the polarized\nproton-deuteron Drell-Yan process is discussed for finding the new distributions.\n\nSPIN-1 STRUCTURE IN ELECTRON SCATTERING\nA general formalism of the deep inelastic electron-deuteron scattering is discussed\nin Ref. [1]. It suggests that there exist additional structure functions in comparison\nwith the electron-proton scattering due to the spin-1 nature of the deuteron. We\nfind that there are eight independent amplitudes for \u03b3(h1 ) + d(H1 ) \u2192 \u03b3(h2 ) +\nd(H2 ), where h1, 2 and H1, 2 are helicities, by using momentum conservation, parity\n\n\finvariance, and time-reversal invariance. Four of them are usual structure functions:\nF1 , F2 , g1 , and g2 , which exist in the spin-1/2 proton. In addition, there are four\nnew structure functions: b1 , b2 , b3 , and b4 . The b3 and b4 are higher-twist functions\nand b2 is related to b1 by the \"Callan-Gross type\" relation b2 = 2xb1 in the Bjorken\nscaling limit, so that the most\nR essential part of new physics is contained in b1 . A\nphenomenological sum rule dx b1 (x) = 0 was proposed [2] if there is no tensor\npolarization for antiquark distributions; however, it does not mean that b1 (x) itself\nvanishes. This sum rule is similar to the Gottfried sum rule in a way [3]. Because\nthere is no solid reason why the antiquark tensor polarization vanishes, the violation\nof the above sum rule could suggest a finite tensor polarization as the Gottfriedsum-rule violation indicated a finite \u016b/d \u0304 asymmetry.\nThere are three twist-2 structure functions: F1 , g1 , and b1 , and they are related\nto electron-deuteron scattering cross sections as\nF1 \u221d hd\u03c3i ,\ng1 \u221d d\u03c3(\u2191, +1) \u2212 d\u03c3(\u2191, \u22121) ,\nb1 \u221d d\u03c3(0) \u2212 [ d\u03c3(+1) + d\u03c3(\u22121) ]/2 .\n\n(1)\n\nHere, d\u03c3(\u2191, +1) and d\u03c3(\u2191, \u22121) indicate spin parallel and anti-parallel cross sections,\nrespectively. On the other hand, \u03c3(0) and d\u03c3(\u00b11) indicate cross sections with the\ndeuteron spin state 0 and \u00b11. This fact means that the electron does not have to be\npolarized for measuring b1 . There are a number of predictions on the x dependence\nof b1 , but we cannot discuss the model results because of the space limitation. The\ninterested reader may find a list of papers in the reference section of Ref. [4]. At\nthis stage, b1 is expected to be quite small, typically b1 /F1 \u223c a few percent or much\nless. However, our experience of g1 implies that the predictions could be wrong.\nIn particular, the tensor structure in the high-energy region is still an unexamined\ntopic experimentally. The HERMES experiment for measuring b1 is in progress\nand its results will be reported in the near future. Therefore, the b1 physics could\nbecome one of popular topics in hadron physics.\n\nPROTON-DEUTERON DRELL-YAN PROCESS\nIn addition to the lepton scattering studies, it is, in principle, possible to investigate the same spin physics in hadron facilities. However, there are only a few\ntheoretical studies on the spin-1 physics in hadron collisions. So far, the polarized\nproton-deuteron (pd) Drell-Yan reaction has been investigated in connection with\nthe tensor structure of the deuteron [4,5].\nImposing the conditions of Hermiticity, parity conservation, and time-reversal\ninvariance, we found many structure functions in the pd Drell-Yan. Even after\nintegrating the cross section over the transverse momentum of the virtual photon\n~ T or after taking the limit QT \u2192 0, there are 22 functions [4]:\nQ\n\n\funpolarized :\n\nW0,0 , W2,0\n\nL/T polarized :\n\nLL\nTT\nLL\nTT\nTU\nUT\nTL\nLT\nTT\nV0,0\n, V0,0\n, V2,0\n, V2,0\n, U2,1\n, U2,1\n, U2,1\n, U2,1\n, U2,2\n\nU Q0\nT Q1\nU Q0\nT Q1\nT Q0\nLQ1\nT Q2\nU Q1\ntensor polarized : V0,0\n, V0,0\n, V2,0\n, V2,0\n, U2,1\n, U2,1\n, U2,1\n, U2,1\n,\nU Q2\nT Q1\nLQ2\nU2,2\n, U2,2\n, U2,2\n.\n\n(2)\n\npol pol\n\nThe subscripts\nof FL,Mp d (F =W , V , or U) indicate that it is obtained by the inteR\ngration d\u03a9 YLM d\u03c3/(d4 Q d\u03a9). The superscripts indicate the polarization states of\nthe proton and deuteron. The notations U, L, and T indicate unpolarized, longitudinally polarized, and transversely polarized states. The quadrupole polarizations\nQ0 , Q1 , and Q2 are specific in the reactions with a spin-1 hadron, and they are\nassociated with the quadrupole terms: Q0 for the term 3 cos2\u03b2B \u2212 1 \u223c Y20 , Q1 for\nsin\u03b2B cos\u03b2B \u223c Y21 , and Q2 for sin2 \u03b2B \u223c Y22 with the polarization angle of the\ndeuteron \u03b2B . The structure functions in the categories \"unpolarized\" and \"L/T\npolarized\" exist in the proton-proton (pp) Drell-Yan. The new functions are listed\nas \"tensor polarized\" and they are associated with the spin-1 deuteron.\nIn defining the spin asymmetry, we should be careful about the tensor contributions. If it is defined in the usual way, for example Ausual\n= [\u03c3(\u2191, \u22121) \u2212 \u03c3(\u2191,\nLL\n+1)]/[\u03c3(\u2191, \u22121) + \u03c3(\u2191, +1)], the denominator is not equal to the unpolarized cross\nsection because of\n1\n2 < \u03c3 > = \u03c3(\u2191, +1) + \u03c3(\u2191, \u22121) + [ 2 \u03c3(\u2191, 0) \u2212 \u03c3(\u2191, +1) \u2212 \u03c3(\u2191, \u22121) ] .\n(3)\n3\nIn order to avoid the above tensor contribution, the unpolarized cross section is used\nfor the denominator in Ref. [4] as a \"theoretical\" definition of the spin asymmetry.\nUsing the obtained pd cross section with the structure functions in Eq.(2), we find\nthe following spin asymmetries:\n< \u03c3 >, ALL , AT T , ALT , AT L , AU T , AT U ,\nAU Q0 , AT Q0 , AU Q1 , ALQ1 , AT Q1 , AU Q2 , ALQ2 , AT Q2 .\n\n(4)\n\nThose in the first line exist in the pp reaction. However, the ones in the second line\nare specific for the pd Drell-Yan, and they are related to the tensor polarizations\nQ0 , Q1 , and Q2 . For example, AU Q0 , AU Q1 , and AU Q2 are given as\nAU Q0\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\nU Q0\nU Q0\n2 V0,0\n+ ( 13 \u2212 cos2 \u03b8) V2,0\n\u03c3(\u2022, +1L ) + \u03c3(\u2022, \u22121L )\n1\n\u03c3(\u2022, 0L ) \u2212\n=\n=\n,\n2 <\u03c3>\n2\n2 W0,0 + ( 13 \u2212 cos2 \u03b8) W2,0\nU Q1\nsin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 sin\u03c6 U2,1\n\u03c3(\u2022, I1 ) \u2212 \u03c3(\u2022, I3 )\n,\n=\n2 <\u03c3>\n2 W0,0 + ( 13 \u2212 cos2 \u03b8) W2,0\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n\u03c3(\u2022, \u03c6B = 0) + \u03c3(\u2022, \u03c6B = \u03c0) \u03c3(\u2022, \u03c6B = \u03c0/2) + \u03c3(\u2022, \u03c6B = 3\u03c0/2)\n=\n\u2212\n2 <\u03c3>\n2\n2\n\nAU Q1 =\nAU Q2\n\n=\n\nU Q2\nsin2 \u03b8 cos2\u03c6 U2,2\n\n2 W0,0 + ( 13 \u2212 cos2 \u03b8) W2,0\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\n\fHere, \u03b8 and \u03c6 are polar and azimuthal angles of the l+ momentum.

Q0 , Q1 , and Q2 polarizations [4].\n\nThe Q0 polarization asymmetry is in principle the same as the one in defining the\ntensor structure function b1 . On the other hand, Q2 is associated with the tensor\nasymmetry in the transverse plane. The Q1 polarization is very peculiar. The\ndeuteron is polarized with the angle 45\u25e6 or 135\u25e6 with respect to the longitudinal\naxis, and the cross section difference is taken. This kind of peculiar asymmetry\ndoes not exist, of course, for the proton. This \"intermediate\" (according to Ref.\n[4]) polarization asymmetry could lead to a new unique field of spin physics. A\nparton-model analysis suggests that the asymmetry Q0 should be related to b1\ntype tensor distributions as [4]\n\u0003\nP 2\u0002 a\na\na\n \u0304a\na ea f1 (x1 ) b\u03041 (x2 ) + f1 (x1 ) b1 (x2 )\n\u0003 ,\nAU Q0 = P 2 \u0002 a\n(6)\na\n \u0304a\n \u0304a\na ea f1 (x1 ) f1 (x2 ) + f1 (x1 ) f1 (x2 )\n\nwhere f1a and ba1 are unpolarized and tensor-polarized distributions for the quark a,\nand f \u03041a and b\u0304a1 are those for the antiquark. The momentum fractions are given by\na\na\nx1 and x2 in the proton and the deuteron. For example,\nR b1 is given by b1 = [qa (0) \u2212\n(qa (+1) + qa (\u22121))/2]/2. We mentioned the sum rule dxb1 (x) = 0. However, this\nrelation crucially depends on the antiquark tensor polarization b\u0304a1 , which cannot\nbe well probed in the electron scattering. One of the major advantages of using\nthe pd reaction is to find b\u0304a1 rather easily, at least according to the formalism. The\nsituation is similar to the case that the detailed x dependence of \u016b/d \u0304 was clarified\nby the Fermilab-E866 Drell-Yan experiment although the difference was originally\nindicated by the NMC data [3]. For example, in the large-xF region, Eq.(6) becomes\nP 2 a\ne f (x1 ) b\u0304a1 (x2 )\nAU Q0 (large xF ) \u2248 P a 2a 1a\n.\n(7)\n \u0304a\na ea f1 (x1 ) f1 (x2 )\n\nTherefore, the antiquark tensor distributions b\u0304a1 can be determined if the unpolarized distributions are well known in the proton and deuteron.\nAnother advantage of the pd Drell-Yan is that the \u016b/d \u0304 asymmetry can be investigated for the transversity distributions [5]. Because they have chiral-odd property,\n\n\fthey cannot be investigated in the inclusive electron scattering. The pd/pp DrellYan ratio is given by [5]\n\u0003\nP 2\u0002\nd\nd\n\u2206(T ) \u03c3pd\na ea \u2206(T ) qa (x1 ) \u2206(T ) q\u0304a (x2 ) + \u2206(T ) q\u0304a (x1 ) \u2206(T ) qa (x2 )\n\u0003\nRpd \u2261\n= P 2\u0002\n2 \u2206(T ) \u03c3pp\n2 a ea \u2206(T ) qa (x1 ) \u2206(T ) q\u0304a (x2 ) + \u2206(T ) q\u0304a (x1 ) \u2206(T ) qa (x2 )\n\u0014\n \u0304 2) \u0015\n\u2206(T ) d(x\n1\n1+\nfor xF \u2192 1 ,\n(8)\n\u2192\n2\n\u2206(T ) \u016b(x2 ) x2 \u21920\nwhere \u2206(T ) = \u2206 or \u2206T depending on\nr = 0.7\nthe longitudinal or transverse polarizar = 1.0\ntion, and \u2206(T ) \u03c3 indicates the polarized\ncross-section difference.

Because other studies of spin-1\nphysics are not discussed in this paper, the author hopes that the interested reader\nwill look at the papers in the extensive lists of Ref. [4,5].\n1.5\n\nq\n\nq\n\n1\n\nq\n\n0.5\n\n\u03bc\u03bc\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nF\n\nSUMMARY\nWe explained the possibilities of investigating the polarized deuteron. Exploring\na new field of hadron spin, namely the tensor structure, we should be able to test\nour knowledge of high-energy spin physics. Because it has not been well investigated yet, we may encounter an unexpected result. Depending on the HERMES\nmeasurement in the near future, this kind of topic could become an interesting\narea of hadron physics. We also expressed the importance of polarized protondeuteron reactions, which are possible not only in collider experiments but also in\nfixed-target ones.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\nP.
