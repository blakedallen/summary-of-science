Bolleddula, H.E. Dillon, A. Alliseda, P. Bhosale, J.C. Berg\nMechanical and Chemical Engineering,\nUniversity of Washington\nOctober 24, 2018\n\nAbstract\nThis is a fluid dynamics video illustrating the impact of ferrofluidic\ndroplets on surfaces of variable wettability. Surfaces studied include\nmica, teflon, and superhydrophobic. A magnet is placed beneath each\nsurface, which modifies the behavior of the ferrofluid by applying additional downward force apart from gravity resulting in reduced droplet\nsize and increased droplet velocity. For the superhydrophobic droplet\na jetting phenomena is shown which only occurs in a limited range\nof impact speeds, higher than observed before, followed by amplified\noscillation due to magnetic field as the drop stabilizes on the surface.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nFerrofluids have attracted attention in microfluidics as a novel method for\na passive transport mechanism. Recent studies [1] have shown water based\nferrofluid droplets can be driven magnetically on a superhydrophobic surfaces and liquid marbles (droplet encapsulated in superhydrophobic powder\ncoating) on hydrophilic surfaces. Here the effects of surface wetting and\nmagnetic actuation on the dynamics of droplet impact are illustrated briefly\nin the video as an introduction to the fluid dynamics of free surface flows.\nThis video explores the impact of ferrofluid droplets and liquid marbles on several surfaces including hydrophilic mica, hydrophobic teflon, and\nsuperhydrophobic treated fumed silica coating. The superhydrophobic surfaces were prepared by dip coating treated fumed silica powder (Cab-O-Sil\nTS530, Cabot Corp.) through acetone solution on a glass slide with a thin\n1\n\n\flayer of epoxy resin (5 Minute Epoxy, ITW Devcon Corp.). The liquid marbles were formed by coating droplets with TS 530 powder. The magnet\nis placed below the surface and the video was recorded with a high speed\ncamera system. Video.\nA summary of the surface impacts are shown in Figure 1. On the mica\nsurface (a), the droplet impacts the surface and spreads to equilibrium due to\nthe high surface energy. On the teflon surface (b), the droplet impacts, then\nspreads and recedes with several periods of damped oscillations amplified by\nthe magnetic field strength. On the superhydrophobic surface (c) the drop\nimpacts and creates an air cavity. The air cavity collapses and causes a jet\nto eject a small drop at 6 times the initial impact velocity.\n\n(a) mica\n\n(b) teflon\n\n(c) superhydrophobic\n\nFigure 1: Impact of a ferrofluidic droplet on mica, teflon, and a superhydrophobic surface.\n\n2\n\n\fFigure 2: High velocity jet leaving ferrofluid after impact on a superhydrophobic surface.\nThe jetting behavior is known to occur only in a narrow range of impact\nspeeds (W e \u223c 8-40) which is a larger range observed by [2]. In this case, the\njet phenomena is caused by the increased velocity induced by the magnet\nand ferrofluid. Figure 2 shows an image from the superhydrophobic impact\nwhere the high velocity ejected drops are shown more clearly.\n\nReferences\n[1] E. Bormashenko, R. Pogreb, Y. Bormashenko, A. Musin, and T.
