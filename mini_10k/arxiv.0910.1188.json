Favorable circumstances are the absence of fast equatorial solar wind streams and\na low CME velocity which allow us to relate the imaging and in-situ data in a straightforward\nway.

This is a first step in predicting both the direction of travel and the internal\nstructure of CMEs from complete remote observations between the Sun and 1 AU, which is one\nof the main requirements for forecasting the geo-effectiveness of CMEs.\nSubject headings:\nmedium\n\n1.\n\nSun:\n\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs)-solar-terrestrial relations-interplanetary\n\nIntroduction\n\n2008; Thernisien et al. 2009; Temmer et al. 2009;\nDavies et al. 2009). Using interplanetary observations by the STEREO Heliospheric Imagers (HIs,\nEyles et al. 2009; Harrison et al. 2009), Davis et al.\n(2009) were able to predict the CME direction of\npropagation and arrival time at Earth with good\naccuracy. However, a major issue in forecasting\nthe geo-effects of a given CME is its orientation\nand its internal magnetic field since long-duration\nsouthward fields lead to strong geomagnetic activity (e.g. Farrugia et al. 1993; Zhao & Hoeksema 1998). Thus the above-mentioned techniques\n\nCoronal mass ejections (CMEs) are violent expulsions of plasma and magnetic flux from the\nouter solar atmosphere.\nUnderstanding their\npropagation characteristics and their internal\nstructure is one of the main goals of the NASA\ntwin-spacecraft Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO, Kaiser et al. 2008). Recently,\nthere have been many efforts to obtain the direction of propagation of CMEs both close to the\nSun and in interplanetary space (e.g. Mierla et al.\n\n1\n\n\fneed to be compared with the magnetic field and\nplasma signatures of CMEs as measured in situ\nin the solar wind (interplanetary coronal mass\nejections, ICMEs). Those ICMEs containing a rotating magnetic field vector are particularly suited\nfor these comparisons. These are generally called\nmagnetic flux ropes (MFRs), and may be magnetic clouds (MCs) if they satisfy other criteria,\nnamely, above-average magnetic field strengths B,\nlow proton temperature (Tp ) and beta (\u03b2p ), and a\nlarge rotation of B (Burlaga et al. 1981).\nUsing SOHO/LASCO coronagraph images,\nCremades & Bothmer (2004) have shown that\nCMEs have a different morphology seen along or\nperpendicular to the axis of symmetry. In this\nLetter we relate, for the first time, both the morphology and direction of a CME seen with the\nSTEREO-HI instrument imaging the heliosphere\nto properties of the associated ICME measured\nin-situ. Our study thus extends previous efforts\nto predict the magnetic field orientation in MFRs\nfrom solar disk and coronagraph observations (e.g.\nBothmer & Schwenn 1998; Yurchyshyn et al. 2001;\nYurchyshyn 2008). The big advantage is that the\nCME can be seen in the HI images from a distant spacecraft (STEREO-Ahead) passing over\nthe other spacecraft (STEREO-Behind) at 1 AU,\nthus bridging the gap between remote and in-situ\nobservations which existed before the STEREO\nera.\nThe CME in question left the Sun \u223c 21:00 UT,\nJune 1, 2008 and its front boundary arrived at\nSTEREO-B at 22:39 UT on June 6, 2008. In previous work Robbrecht et al. (2009) used coronagraph and on-disk extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images to show that this CME was not accompanied\nby typical on-disk signatures (filament eruption,\nflare, dimming, EUV wave), the main reason being that the CME was of the streamer-blowout\ntype lifting off slowly from high in the corona\n(R \u2248 1.15 \u2212 1.4). This previously unrecognized\ntype of CME is a good candidate for causing socalled \"problem storms\", i.e., those without an obvious solar origin (e.g. Zhang et al. 2007). In this\nLetter, we complement and extend the study of\nRobbrecht et al. (2009) by modeling STEREO-B\nobservations to obtain a more complete view of\nthe MFR inside the ICME at 1 AU and discuss\nhow its structure and direction could have been\nforecast from remote observations. CME-ICME\n\nevents suitable for this kind of study are very rare\nduring this unusually quiet solar minimum (see\nDavis et al. 2009; M\u00f6stl et al. 2009a). This event\nis extraordinarily well suited for this kind of analysis because (i) the absence of equatorial coronal\nholes (and thus fast solar wind streams) allows\na straightforward interpretation of the HI images\n(Lugaz et al. 2008), and (ii) it is a slow CME, justifying partly an assumption of constant velocity\ninherent to one of the applied techniques.\n2.\n\nIn situ observations of the ICME at\nSTEREO-B\n\nAt 00:00 UT, June 7 2008, STEREO-B was\n25.38\u25e6 east of Earth at 1.0545 AU and STEREOA 29.26\u25e6 west at 0.9567 AU, with a separation\nof 54.64\u25e6 . Fig. 1 plots STEREO-B magnetic field\ndata in Radial-Tangential-Normal (RTN) coordinates and plasma bulk parameters at 1 min resolution, from the IMPACT/MAG (Acu\u00f1a et al.\n(2008); Luhmann et al. (2008)) and PLASTIC\n(Galvin et al. 2008) instruments, respectively.\nSTEREO-B encountered a MFR between 22:39\nUT, June 6 and 12:27 UT, June 7, 2008 (inner\ntwo vertical solid lines). This interval is partly an\noutcome of our reconstruction technique (see Hu\net al. 2004) and partly determined by eye so that\nit encompasses the smoothly rotating B-vector.\nThe two outer solid lines indicate a forward\n(ts =June 6 15:35 UT) and a very weak reverse\nshock tr = June 7 20:48 UT, see e.g. Gosling et al.\n(1998). There are two clear proton enhancements\nof Np \u2248 30 cm\u22123 on either side of the MFR, the\nfirst one being, in part, the sheath behind the forward shock. The front of the second density peak\narrives at tc \u2248 12:00 UT, June 7. For most of the\nMFR, Tp , is higher than that expected for normal\nsolar wind expansion (red trace, Lopez (1987)).\nThis precludes the MFR from being a magnetic\ncloud.\nWe modeled these data using Grad-Shafranov\nreconstruction (Hu & Sonnerup 2002) and forcefree fitting (the latter shown in parentheses, Lepping et al. 1990). (For recent multi-spacecraft validation of the GS method see Liu et al. (2008);\nM\u00f6stl et al. (2009a,b).) The MFR is right-handed\nwith an axis orientation of \u03b8 = 51(37)\u25e6 , \u03c6 =\n278(326)\u25e6 in RTN coordinates (\u03b8 is the inclination to the RT plane, \u03c6 is measured from R (0\u25e6 )\n\n2\n\n\ftowards T (90\u25e6 )). Thus the MFR axis points\nroughly north-east as shown in Fig. 2. The modeled axial field strength B0 =15.4 (20.3) nT, the\nradial scale size (diameter) D = 0.130(0.155) AU,\nand the impact parameter (the closest distance of\nthe spacecraft to the MFR axis) is p = 0.81(0.60)\u00d7\nD. The toroidal and poloidal magnetic fluxes are\n\u03a6t = 0.72(0.37) \u00d7 1021 Mx and \u03a6p = 1.19(1.47) \u00d7\n1021 Mx/AU. These values are rather typical for\nICMEs which are associated with medium-sized\nflares (Qiu et al. 2007).\nFigure 2 shows a 3D plot of the local MFR reconstruction in the heliosphere, in a coordinate\nsystem centered on STEREO-B, seen from north\nlooking down on the RT plane (close to the solar equatorial plane, top panel) and from another\nview point (bottom panel). Several field lines\nand its cross-section (color contour) are shown\nas well as its intersection (black contours) with\nthe RT plane. It emerges from the reconstruction that STEREO-B crossed the western flank\nof the MFR which intersected the RT plane between 24\u25e6 to 39\u25e6 east of Earth, while the MFR axis\ncrosses at 33\u25e6 . This is important when comparing the ICME structure at 1 AU to the results of\nthe CME direction\u2013finding techniques in Section\n4. Further, in Fig. 2 the spacecraft are indicated\nas STEREO-B (blue triangle), Wind (black diamond), STEREO-A (red X). The Thomson surface for STEREO-A is the blue sphere, the yellow\nsphere the size of the COR2 field of view (15 R ).\nThe CME directions from the method of triangulation (TR, yellow), forward modeling (FM, green),\nkinematic Fixed-\u03a6 (KP, black) and elongationfitting (EF, red) are indicated (see later sections\nand Table 1). The dashed (solid) black lines centered on STEREO-A indicate the boundaries of\nthe HI1 (HI2) field of views.\n\ntion process, which includes corrections for flatfielding, dark currents, background subtraction\nand the elimination of stars (Davies et al. 2009;\nBrown et al. 2009). Only then can intriguing details of the morphology and evolution of the CME\nbe seen. We strongly encourage the reader to look\nat the corrected running difference movies (see the\nelectronic supplements), of which we show some\nselected images in Fig. 3.\nIn HI1A and HI2A, both the CME leading edge\n(LE) and core clearly show an arc-like shape, typical of a CME viewed orthogonal to its axis of\nsymmetry (Cremades & Bothmer 2004), which is\nconsistent with the derived MFR inclination of\n\u03b8 \u2248 45\u25e6 \u001d 0\u25e6 . The intensity of the CME observed in the HI white-light images is determined\nby Thomson scattering of electrons (e.g. Vourlidas\n& Howard 2006). Shortly after the CME enters\nthe HI2A FoV it leaves the Thomson surface of\nstrongest scattering (Fig. 2) and the intensity declines. The northern part vanishes earlier (at \u223c50\u25e6\nelongation) than the southern part, which can be\ntracked all the way to STEREO-B. Assuming an\nevenly distributed density of the CME this effect\nis most likely caused by the CME and MFR inclination from which the angle \u03c6 might be inferred:\nthe northern part is tilted away from the observer,\nlooking to the east (west) this yields \u03c6 \u2248 270(90)\u25e6\nfor \u03b8 \u2248 +45\u25e6 . This is again consistent with the\nMFR's moderate inclination (\u03b8 \u2248 45\u25e6 ). The assumption made here that STEREO-B crosses the\nCME close to its apex or nose is supported by\ndirection\u2013finding techniques in section 4. In this\ncase \u03c6 is expected to be close to 270 or 90 degrees. Additionally, there is a 180\u25e6 ambiguity in\n\u03c6 depending on the sign of \u03b8; for a southward\u2013\npointing axial field, the opposite is obtained (see\nalso conclusions).\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\nRemote imaging of the CME by STEREOA\n\nRunning difference images of the CME obtained from both cameras (HI1A: pointing 4 \u2212 24\u25e6\naway from Sun center, 40 min cadence; HI2A,\n18.7 \u2212 88.7\u25e6 , 2 hours) of the Heliospheric Imagers\naboard STEREO-A are shown in Fig. 3, from\n15:29 UT, June 2, when the CME completely enters the HI1A FoV until 16:09 UT, June 6 (\u2248 ts ).\nThe data have been put through the full reduc-\n\nCME three\u2013part structure and heliospheric propagation\n\nWe now compare the results of direction\u2013\nfinding results applied close to the solar surface\n(2 \u2212 20R ) with those used in the interplanetary\nmedium (20 \u2212 220R ), and the ICME structure\nat 1 AU.\nFirst, the elongation \u000f(t) of the LE and core\nwere manually measured in the HI FoVs and fitted\nwith the Sheeley et al. (2008) formula (e.g. Rouil-\n\n3\n\n\ffrom an observer, negative means east of Earth).\nIn Fig. 2 the mean of the two directions is plotted. It is also seen in Fig. 4 that until r \u2248 140R\nor 0.62 AU, the Point-P and Fixed-\u03a6 methods\nyield quite similar values for r(t), with r(t) being slightly lower for Point-P close to the Sun (see\nalso Wood et al. 2009). After this, the unphysical\nassumption of Point-P that the CME cannot be\ntracked farther than d leads to a divergence from\nFixed-\u03a6 to smaller values of r(t).\nWe now compare the directions obtained from\nthe interplanetary techniques with direction\u2013\nfinding techniques derived from coronagraph observations. Fig. 4 (inset) shows the kinematics of\na distinct feature along the CME leading edge,\none that could be observed and measured from\nLASCO C2/C3 and COR2A images. As the feature is seen from different viewing angles, the\nde-projected propagation direction of the CME\nis derived by applying a geometrical triangulation method as described in Temmer et al. (2009).\nThe same feature has been tracked in the HI1A\nFoV (left yellow \u00d7 symbols in Fig. 3) which yields\n\u03a6 = \u221245 \u00b1 5\u25e6 . The applied technique is limited by the underlying assumptions (same CME\nfeature distinguished in used instruments, radial\noutward motion of CME). However, the results\nare consistent with those derived by Thernisien\net al. (2009), who use a forward modeling (FM)\ntechnique which presumes a particular shape of\nthe CME, and find \u03a6 = \u221237 \u00b1 10\u25e6 . Table 1 summarizes the various results of CME directions and\nde-projected velocities, and the direction vectors\nare plotted in Fig. 2. In summary, the methods yield roughly the same de\u2013projected direction\nwhen compared to the MFR reconstruction, with\na slight offset to the east by \u2248 10 \u2212 15\u25e6 of the\nmethods applied closer to the Sun. Concerning\nthe latitudinal direction, TR and FM yielded results to within \u00b15\u25e6 latitude of the solar equator,\nand the measurements for EF and KP were also\ntaken within that range. This also means that\nSTEREO-B encounters the apex or nose of the\nCME and not one of its \"legs\".\nThe CME velocities clearly show an acceleration between the coronagraphs and the heliospheric imagers as well as a consistency of the latter with the proton bulk velocities as measured in\nsitu. From EF a velocity difference of \u2206V \u2248 60\nkm s\u22121 between the leading edge (401 km s\u22121 ) and\n\nlard et al. 2008; Davies et al. 2009) to infer a constant velocity and direction (see Table 1) as well\nas the arrival times (18:34 UT, June 6 [LE] and\n13:08 UT, June 7 [core]). The technique assumes\nthat the CME is well represented by the features\ntracked in the white-light images which result from\nline-of-sight integration and Thomson scattering\neffects (Vourlidas & Howard 2006). The error bars\nfor the direction and velocity follow from an error\nin \u000f(t) of \u00b13\u25e6 . The arrival times correspond very\nwell with the arrival of the two density peaks on\neither side of the plasma void region (dashed vertical lines in Fig. 1). It thus becomes plausible\nhow, in this case, the classic CME features seen\nin coronagraphs (Illing & Hundhausen 1985) correspond to the ICME observations. The extended\nbright front, with the LE as its outermost edge,\ncorresponds to the interval of the first density enhancement reaching up to the MFR; the void or\ndark cavity is the MFR; and the core is the dense\nmaterial trailing the MFR. We speculate that each\ndouble density peak bracketing the MFR in Fig. 1\narises from material originating in the corona (innermost density peaks adjacent to the MFR) and\nsolar wind swept up by the CME in interplanetary\nspace (outermost peaks), i.e., the sheaths (see also\nRiley et al. 2008).\nFig. 4 presents the time-distance plot from Sun\nto Earth. To convert \u000f(t) to distance from the Sun\nr(t) in Fig. 4, two simple methods have been put\nforward: the \"Point-P\" and \"Fixed-\u03a6\" methods\n(Kahler & Webb 2007; Wood et al. 2009). Basically, Point-P assumes that the CME's LE is a\nspherical front centered on the Sun, which yields\n(Howard et al. 2007)\nr(t) = d sin \u000f(t)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere d is the distance of the observer from the\nSun. Fixed-\u03a6 assumes the CME to be point-like,\npropagating radially along a constant angle \u03a60 to\nthe observer,\nr(t) =\n\nd sin \u000f\n.\nsin (\u000f + \u03a60 )\n\n(2)\n\nThe results are shown in Fig. 4. Linking the observations with the timing ts (tc ) when the CME\nLE (core) hits STEREO-B located at 226 R , the\nangle \u03a6 can be derived with \u03a6 = \u221230(\u221226)\u25e6 . (Angle \u03a6 is measured from Earth while \u03a60 is measured\n4\n\n\fthe core (340 km s\u22121 ) is consistent with \u2206V = 49\nkm s\u22121 between the MFR front and back boundary. These are values typical of ICMEs at 1 AU\nduring solar minimum (\u2206V \u2248 60-70 km s\u22121 : Jian\net al. 2006); (cf. 45 km s\u22121 found by Burlaga &\nBehannon 1982). Note that both are larger than\n\u2206V = 19 km s\u22121 between the averaged velocities\nof the two in situ density peaks which correspond\nto the white-light features.\n5.\n\n3. What is the magnetic flux content of this\npre-existing magnetic flux rope on the Sun without reconnection signatures on the solar surface?\nWe find that it is surprisingly high, comparable to\nevents connected to C or even M-class flares (Qiu\net al. 2007). Thus, this can be seen as evidence for\na formation of the magnetic flux rope before the\neruption for this particular event.\nThe tools and concepts we developed allow a\nfirst comparison between 3D CME directions and\nmodeled in-situ data of those ICMEs which contain magnetic flux ropes or magnetic clouds. Modeling ICMEs is important in order to obtain good\nestimates of their orientations and impact parameters, and where the spacecraft intersects the\naxis (the eastern/western part of the central MFR\nsouth/north). Our results underline the need of\nhaving coronagraphs and instruments which image the heliosphere between the Sun and the Earth\nfrom a vantage view-point away from Earth so as\nto enhance our ability to forecast the geo-effects\nof coronal mass ejections.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe described observations of a CME as it propagates from the Sun to 1 AU and detailed the relationship to its modeled in-situ signatures. From\nthis we found various interesting clues useful for\nforecasting the geoeffects of CMEs:\n1. How can the internal structure of the MFR\nbe inferred from remote observations? The distinct arc-like morphology points to an inclined\nMFR axis and, from the intensity evolution perpendicular to the ecliptic plane (northern part\nvanishes earlier than the southern), we estimated\n\u03b8 \u2248 \u00b145\u25e6 . The MFR's axial and poloidal field directions are consistent with the global solar dipole\nfield (see the PFSS model in Robbrecht et al.\n2009) and indicated by black arrows in Fig. 2:\nThe poloidal field goes from south to north and\nthe eruption comes from the southern hemisphere,\nwhich yields a right-handed MFR (as observed),\nand thus an axial field to the east (away from the\nobserver, thus \u03b8 \u2248 +45\u25e6 , \u03c6 \u2248 270\u25e6 ). The MFR's\naxial field at the Sun is likely to be close to the\nsolar equator. This can be seen in an accompanying movie in Robbrecht et al. (2009), which shows\na more compact CME shape closer to the Sun in\naccordance with the Cremades & Bothmer (2004)\ninterpretation. A slight subsequent clockwise rotation (consistent with positive chirality for a twistto-writhe conversion) of roughly 45\u25e6 would then\nmatch the MFR observations.\n2. Is the direction of the CME obtained from\nvarious direction-finding techniques consistent\nwith the observations at 1 AU? Yes, within the\nerror bars all methods we use give a consistent\npicture. There seems to be a minor offset to the\nwest when techniques are applied closer to the\nSun. Whether this is due to a bias of the different\ntechniques or a slight non-radial CME propagation is the subject of further investigations.\n\nThe authors are grateful to the referee for\nmany helpful comments.
