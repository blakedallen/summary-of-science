Unfortunately this daunting possibility\nis increasingly likely as observations converge towards\nan equation of state of w = \u22121. Combining galaxy,\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) data, Seljak et al. [1] recently found\n<\n\u22121.1 <\n\u223c w \u223c \u22120.9 at 1\u03c3. On the one hand, a cosmological constant is theoretically simple as it involves only\none parameter. However, observations would offer no further guidance to explain its minuteness, whether due to\nsome physical mechanism or anthropic reasoning [2].\nA more fertile outcome is w 6= \u22121. This implies dynamics - the vacuum energy is changing in a Hubble\ntime - and hence, new physics. A well-studied candidate is quintessence [3, 4], a scalar field \u03c6 rolling down a\nself-interaction potential V (\u03c6). Its equation of state,\nw\u03c6 =\n\n\u03c6\u03072 /2 \u2212 V (\u03c6)\n\n\u03c6\u03072 /2 + V (\u03c6)\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\ncan be < \u22121/3 for sufficiently flat V (\u03c6) and thus lead to\ncosmic speed-up. Whether dark energy is quintessence or\nsomething else, this case offers hope that further observations, either cosmological or in the solar system, may\nunveil the underlying microphysics of the new sector.\nAn even more exciting possibility is w < \u22121. In fact\nthere are already indications of this [5, 6] from various\nindependent analyses of the \"Gold\" SNIa dataset [7].\nMoreover, by constraining redshift parameterizations of\nw(z) they also exclude that this could result from assuming a constant w [8, 9]. The w < \u22121 regime would rule\nout quintessence since w\u03c6 \u2265 \u22121 (see Eq. (1)), as well as\nmost dark energy models.\nDevising consistent models with w < \u22121 has proven\nto be challenging. Existing theories generally involves\nghosts, such as phantom models [10], resulting in instabilities and other pathologies [11]. Fields with non-minimal\ncouplings to gravity, such as Brans-Dicke theory, can\nmimic w < \u22121 [12]. However, solar-system constraints\nrender the Brans-Dicke scalar field nearly inert, thereby\n\ndriving w indistinguishably close to \u22121. Other proposals\nfor w < \u22121 include brane-world scenarios [13], quantum effects [14], quintessence-moduli interactions [15],\nand photon-axion conversion [16].\nIn this paper we show that w < \u22121 naturally arises\nif quintessence interacts with dark matter. The mechanism is simple. Due to the interaction, the mass of dark\nmatter particles depends on \u03c6. Consequently, in the recent past the dark matter energy density redshifts more\nslowly than the usual a\u22123 , which, for fixed present matter density, implies a smaller matter density in the past\ncompared to normal cold dark matter (CDM).\nAn observer unaware of the interaction and fitting the\ndata assuming normal CDM implicitly ascribes this dark\nmatter deficit to the dark energy. The effective dark\nenergy fluid thus secretly receives two contributions: the\nquintessence part and the deficit in dark matter. The\nlatter is growing in time, therefore causing the effective\ndark energy density to also increase with time, hence\nw < \u22121.\nTreating dark matter as non-interacting is a sine qua\nnon for inferring w < \u22121. There are no wrong-sign kinetic terms in our model - in fact the combined dark\nmatter plus dark energy fluid satisfies w > \u22121. Hence\nthe theory is well-defined and free of instabilities.\nInteracting dark matter/dark energy models have been\nstudied in various contexts [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23].\nHuey and Wandelt [24] realized that coupled dark matter/quintessence can yield an effective w < \u22121. (See\nalso [25] for similar ideas.) However, the dynamics in [24]\nare such that DM density becomes negligibly small for\nz >\n\u223c 1, thereby forcing the addition of a second noninteracting DM component. In contrast, our model involves a single (interacting) DM component.\nGiven the lack of competing consistent models, we advocate that measuring w < \u22121 would hint at an interaction in the dark sector. More accurate observations could\nthen search for direct evidence of this interaction. For instance, we show that the extra attractive force between\ndark matter particles enhances the growth of perturbations and leads to a few percent excess of power on small\nscales. Other possible signatures are discussed below.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nDARK SECTOR INTERACTION\n\nConsider a quintessence scalar field \u03c6 which couples to\nthe dark matter via, e.g., a Yukawa-like interaction\nf (\u03c6/MPl )\u03c8\u0304\u03c8 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere is f is an arbitrary function of \u03c6 and \u03c8 is a\ndark matter Dirac spinor. In order to avoid constraints\nfrom solar-system tests of gravity, we do not couple \u03c6 to\nbaryons. See [19], however, for an alternative approach.\nIn the presence of this dark-sector interaction, the energy density in the dark matter no longer redshifts as a\u22123\nbut instead scales as\n\u03c1DM \u223c\n\nf (\u03c6/MPl )\n.\na3\n\n(3)\n\nThis can be easily understood since the coupling in\nEq. (2) implies a \u03c6-dependent mass for the dark matter\nparticles scaling as f (\u03c6/MPl ). Since the number density\nredshifts as a\u22123 as usual, Eq. (3) follows.\nThus the Friedmann equation reads\n(0)\n\n2\n3H 2 MPl\n=\n\n\u03c1DM f (\u03c6/MPl )\n+ \u03c1\u03c6 ,\na3\nf0\n\n(4)\n\nwhere f0 = f (\u03c60 /MPl ) with \u03c60 the field value today, and\n1\n\u03c1\u03c6 = \u03c6\u03072 + V (\u03c6)\n2\n\n(5)\n(0)\n\u03c1DM\n\nis the scalar field energy density. With a = 1 today,\nis identified as the present dark matter density.\nMeanwhile, the scalar field evolution is governed by\n\nobtained by comparing Eqs. (4) and (8). The end result\nis to effectively ascribe part of the dark matter to dark\nenergy. Notice that today the first term vanishes, hence\nthe effective dark energy density coincides with \u03c1\u03c6 . In the\npast, however, \u03c6 6= \u03c60 , and the two differ. In particular,\nwe will find that the time-dependence of \u03c1eff\nDE can be such\nthat weff < \u22121.\nTo show this explicitly requires an expression for weff .\nTaking the time derivative of Eq. (9) and substituting\nthe scalar equation of motion, Eq. (6), we obtain\n)\n\u0015\n(0) \u0014\n\u03c1DM f (\u03c6/MPl )\n\u2212 1 + (1 + w\u03c6 )\u03c1\u03c6 .\na3 f (\u03c60 /MPl )\n(10)\nComparing with Eq. (7) allows us to read off weff :\nd\u03c1eff\nDE\n= \u22123H\ndt\n\n\u0015\n(0) \u0014\n\u03c1DM f (\u03c6/MPl )\n\u22121 \u22650\nx\u2261\u2212 3\na \u03c1\u03c6 f (\u03c60 /MPl )\n\n(7)\n\nMeanwhile, the dark matter is generally assumed to be\nnon-interacting CDM, resulting in the Friedmann equation\n(0)\n\n\u03c1\n+ \u03c1eff\n(8)\n3H\n= DM\nDE .\na3\nAn observer applying these assumptions to our model\nwould infer an effective dark energy fluid with\n\u0015\n(0) \u0014\n\u03c1DM f (\u03c6/MPl )\neff\n\u03c1DE \u2261 3\n\u2212 1 + \u03c1\u03c6 ,\n(9)\na\nf (\u03c60 /MPl )\n2\n\n2\nMPl\n\n(12)\n\nfor all times until today, with equality holding at the\npresent time. It is straightforward to show that weff takes\na very simple form when expressed in terms of x:\nweff =\n\n(6)\n\nThis differs from the usual Klein-Gordon equation for\nquintessence models by the last term on the right-hand\nside, arising from the interaction with dark matter.\nThe standard approach to constraining dark energy\nwith experimental data assumes that it is a noninteracting perfect fluid, fully described by its equation\nof state, weff . Given some weff (z), the evolution of the\ndark energy density is then determined by the energy\nconservation equation:\nd\u03c1eff\nDE\n= \u22123H(1 + weff )\u03c1eff\nDE .\ndt\n\n(\u0014\n\n)\n\u0015 (0)\n\u03c1DM\nf (\u03c6/MPl )\n1 + weff = eff\n+ (1 + w\u03c6 )\u03c1\u03c6 .\n\u22121\nf (\u03c60 /MPl )\na3\n\u03c1DE\n(11)\nNow suppose that the dynamics of \u03c6 are such that\nf (\u03c6/MPl ) increases in time. This occurs in a wide class\nof models, as we will see in Section III. In this case,\n1\n\n(0)\n\n\u03c1\nf,\u03c6\n\u03c6\u0308 + 3H \u03c6\u0307 = \u2212V,\u03c6 \u2212 DM\n.\n3\na f0\n\n(\n\nw\u03c6\n.\n1\u2212x\n\n(13)\n(0)\n\nThis is our main result. Since x = 0 today, one has weff =\n(0)\nw\u03c6 , which is greater than or equal to \u22121. In the past,\nhowever, x > 0. Moreover, for sufficiently flat potentials,\nw\u03c6 \u2248 \u22121. Hence it is possible to have weff < \u22121 in the\npast. This is shown explicitly in Fig. 1 for a fiducial case:\nf (\u03c6/MPl ) = exp(\u03b2\u03c6/MPl ) and V (\u03c6) = M 4 (MPl /\u03c6)\u03b1 .\n\nIII.\n\nQUINTESSENCE DYNAMICS\n\nWe now come back to the equation of motion for \u03c6,\nEq. (6), and demonstrate that its dynamics can lead to\nweff < \u22121. The scalar potential V (\u03c6) is assumed to satisfy the tracker condition [26],\n\u0393\u2261\n\nV,\u03c6\u03c6 V\n> 1.\n2\nV,\u03c6\n\n(14)\n\nFor an exponential potential, \u0393 = 1, while \u0393 = 1 + \u03b1\u22121\nfor V (\u03c6) \u223c \u03c6\u2212\u03b1 . Moreover, we take the coupling function\nf to be monotonically increasing.\nWithout coupling to dark matter, the scalar field would\nrun off to infinite values. Here, however, the interaction\n\n\f3\n2\nf,\u03c6\u03c6 /f >\nThe right hand side is greater than unity for MPl\n\u223c\n1. In addition, as we will see later, \u0393 \u226b 1 for consistency with observations of large-scale structure. These\nconditions guarantee that fluctuations about the minimum of the effective potential are small at the present\ntime. For concreteness, let us evaluate this in the case of\nf (\u03c6) = exp(\u03b2\u03c6/MPl ) and V (\u03c6) = M 4 (MPl /\u03c6)\u03b1 :\n!\n(0)\n\u03a9\nm20\n\u03b1\n+\n1\n(0)\nDM\n.\n(18)\n> 3\u03b2 2 \u03a9DM 1 +\nH02\n\u03b1 \u03a9(0)\nDE\n\n>\nThis is indeed larger than unity for \u03b1 <\n\u223c 1 and \u03b2 \u223c O(1),\nthe latter corresponding to a gravitational-strength interaction between dark matter and dark energy.\nNext we show that the field is slow-rolling along this\nattractor solution.

This is\nbecause the period of oscillations about the minimum,\nm\u22121 , is much shorter than a Hubble time, i.e., m \u226b H.\nWe show this for the present epoch, leaving the proof for\nall times as a straightforward exercise.\nThe mass of small fluctuations about the minimum is\ngiven as usual by\n(\n)\n(0)\n(0)\n2\nf,\u03c6\n\u03c1DM f,\u03c6\u03c6\n\u0393 \u03c1DM f\n2\neff\n1+\n, (16)\nm = V,\u03c6\u03c6 = 3\na\nf0\nf,\u03c6\u03c6 f V a3 f0\nwhere we have substituted \u0393 using its definition,\n(0)\nEq.

(20) implies that \u03c6 has negligible\nkinetic energy compared to potential energy, which is the\ndefinition of slow-roll.\nThe slow-roll property has many virtues. First of all, it\nimplies that our attractor solution is different than that\nderived by Amendola and collaborators [18]. In their\ncase, during the matter-dominated era, the scalar field\nkinetic energy dominates over the potential energy and\nremains a fixed fraction of the critical density. This significantly alters the growth rate of perturbations. Microwave background anisotropy then constrains the dark\nmatter-dark energy coupling to be less than gravitational\nstrength: \u03b2 < 0.1 for f (\u03c6) = exp(\u03b2\u03c6/MPl ). In our case,\nas we will see in Sec. V C, slow-roll implies a nearly identical growth rate to that in CDM models, even in the\ninteresting regime \u03b2 >\n\u223c 1.\nMore importantly, slow-roll means w\u03c6 \u2248 \u22121. As argued below Eq. (13), this facilitates obtaining weff < \u22121.\nIn essence, slow-roll is enhanced by the dark matter\ninteraction term in Eq. (6) which acts to slow down\nthe field. To see this explicitly, note that in usual\nquintessence models (without dark matter interaction),\nslow-roll is achieved in the large \u0393 limit, for which\n\u03c6\u03072\n1\n\u2248\n.\n2V\n4\u0393\n\n(21)\n\nComparison with Eq. (20) shows that this ratio is further\nsuppressed by H 2 /m2 \u226a 1 in our case.\nThe attractor solution described here has a large basin\nof attraction. The covariant form of Eq. (6) involves T\u03bc\u03bc ,\n\n\f4\nthe trace of the stress tensor of all fields coupled to \u03c6.\nThese do not exclusively consist of DM. For instance,\nin a supersymmetric model where the DM is the lightest supersymmetric particle, \u03c6 could conceivably couple to a host of superpartners. Deep in the radiationdominated era, the T\u03bc\u03bc source term is generally negligible compared to the Hubble damping term, 3H \u03c6\u0307. However, they become comparable for about a Hubble time\nwhenever a particle species coupled to \u03c6 becomes nonrelativistic [28], therefore driving \u03c6 towards the minimum\nof its effective potential. This provides an efficient mechanism for reaching the attractor [20].\n\nIV.\n\nAN EXPLICIT EXAMPLE\n\n(0)\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b1M 4 MPl\n\u03b2 \u03c1DM \u03b2(\u03c6\u2212\u03c60 )/MPl\n+\ne\n= 0.\n\u03b1+1\n\u03c6\nMPl a3\n\n(22)\n(0)\n\n2\nEvaluating this today, and noting that V0 \u2248 3H02 MPl\n\u03a9DE\nbecause of slow-roll, we obtain\n(0)\n\n\u03b1 \u03a9DE\n\u03c60\n\u2248\n.\nMPl\n\u03b2 \u03a9(0)\n\n(23)\n\nDM\n\nEquations (22) and (23) combine to provide a simple expression for the redshift-evolution of \u03c6 as it follows the\nminimum of the effective potential:\n\u0012\n\n\u03c6\n\u03c60\n\n\u0013\u03b1+1\n\n= (1 + z)\u22123 e\u03b2(\u03c60 \u2212\u03c6)/MPl .\n\n(0)\n\n\u03c1\u03c6 \u2248\n\n\u03b2 \u03c6 \u03c1DM \u03b2(\u03c6\u2212\u03c60 )/MPl\nV\nV,\u03c6 =\ne\n.\nV,\u03c6\n\u03b1 MPl a3\n\n(25)\n\nSubstituting this and Eq.

Moreover,\nsince the field is slow-rolling, we have w\u03c6 \u2248 \u22121. Therefore, Eq. (13) implies\n\nIn this Section we illustrate our mechanism within a\nspecific model. We consider an inverse power-law potential, V (\u03c6) = M 4 (MPl /\u03c6)\u03b1 , where the mass scale M is\ntuned to \u223c 10\u22123 eV in order for acceleration to occur\nat the present epoch. This potential is a prototypical\nexample of a tracker potential in quintessence scenarios.\nIts runaway form is in harmony with non-perturbative\npotentials for moduli in supergravity and string theories.\nThe coupling function is chosen to be f (\u03c6) =\nexp(\u03b2\u03c6/MPl ). The exponential form is generic in dimensional reduction in string theory where \u03c6 measures\nthe volume of extra dimensions. Moreover, \u03b2 is expected to be of order unity, corresponding to gravitational strength. While the coupling to matter exacerbates the fine-tuning of the quintessence potential [31],\nwe find the phenomenological consequences of our model\nsufficiently interesting to warrant sweeping naturalness\nissues under the rug.\nIn this example, the condition at the minimum reads\n\u2212\n\n\u03c1\u03c6 \u2248 const., since \u03c1\u03c6 does not obey the usual conservation equation. Using Eq. (22), we instead have\n\nweff \u2248 \u2212\n\n1\n\u2264 \u22121 ,\n1\u2212x\n\n(27)\n\nwith the approximate equality holding today. Hence this\nyields an effective dark energy fluid with w < \u22121 in the\nrecent past.\nNote from Eq. (26) that x = 1 at some time in the\npast, implying that |weff | momentarily diverges and then\nbecomes positive again at higher redshifts. This is because \u03c1eff\nDE eventually becomes negative, at which point\nthe effective dark energy fluid has both negative pressure\nand energy density. As z increases further and x becomes\nlarge, one has weff \u2248 0, and the fluid behaves like dust.\nIn Fig. 1 we plot the redshift evolution of weff and w\u03c6\n(0)\nfor \u03b1 = 0.2, \u03b2 = 1 and \u03a9DE = 0.7. (As will be discussed in the next Section, a small value for \u03b1 is required\nfor consistency with large-scale structure observations.)\nWhile w\u03c6 remains bounded from below by -1, weff is less\nthan -1 for z >\n\u223c 0.1, as claimed above.\nThe evolution of weff (z) shown in Fig. 1 is consistent\nwith the observational limits on redshift dependent parameterizations of the dark energy equation of state [6].\nOne way to see this is to consider the weighted average\nR\n\u03a9eff (a)weff (a)da\nR\n,\n(28)\nw\u0304eff \u2261\n\u03a9eff (a)da\n\nwhere the integral runs from z = 0 up to the maximum redshift of current SN Ia data, z \u223c 1.5. This gives\nw\u0304eff \u2248 \u22121.1, which lies within the allowed range of w\nfound in [1]. Note that while Fig. 1 was derived using\nthe above analytical expressions, we have checked these\nagainst numerical solutions of the equations of motion\nand found very good agreement.\n\n(24)\n\nNext we calculate the resulting effective equation of\nstate. To do so, we first need an expression for \u03c1\u03c6 as a\nfunction of redshift. Notice that in the slow-roll approximation, \u03c1\u03c6 \u2248 V (\u03c6). This does not imply, however, that\n\nV.\n\nOBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS AND\nCONSEQUENCES\n\nWe have shown that the interaction between\nquintessence and dark matter can mimic the cosmology\n\n\f5\nof a phantom fluid. In this Section we discuss some observational consequences of this scenario and argue that\nit is consistent with current observations. At the level\nof homogeneous cosmology this is certainly true, as long\nas parameters are chosen such that weff lies within the\nallowed range. We argue that this is also the case when\nconsidering inhomogeneities, at least at the linear level.\nThe main effect here is the fifth force between dark matter particles mediated by \u03c6, which enhances the growth\nrate of density perturbations.\nA rigorous comparison with observations would require\na full likelihood analysis including a host of cosmological probes, which is beyond the scope of this paper. We\ninstead contend ourselves with a simplified (and perhaps\nmore conservative) analysis to derive general constraints.\nAs in Sec. IV, we focus on an exponential coupling function and inverse power-law potential.\nA.\n\npotential studied in [24] has a very different attractor\nsolution. In this case, dark energy remains a constant\nfraction of the total energy density and modifies the DM\nequation of state at all redshift. This in turn renders\nthe matter density negligibly small for z >\n\u223c 1. Therefore,\n(0)\nin order to satisfy constraints on \u03a9DM (as well as zeq ),\none must introduce a second DM component, which is\nnon-interacting and dominates for most of the history.\nFinally, we note that while Eq. (30) is an extra tuning\non V (\u03c6), normal quintessence also suffers from the same\nconstraint. Indeed, \"tracker\" quintessence with V (\u03c6) =\nM 4 (MPl /\u03c6)\u03b1 leads to a dark energy equation of state\nw\u03c6 = \u2212\n\n2\n.\n\u03b1+2\n\n(31)\n\nImposing the current observational constraint w < \u22120.9\nresults in a bound on \u03b1 identical to Eq. (30).\n\nMass estimates from large-scale structure\nB.\n\nThe tightest constraint comes from various estimates\nof the dark matter density at different redshifts. Since\nthe dark matter redshifts more slowly than a\u22123 in our\nmodel, then for fixed present matter density this implies\na smaller matter density in the past compared to a CDM\nmodel. Indeed, at early times (\u03c6 \u226a \u03c60 ), the matter\ndensity differs from that of a usual dust CDM model by\n!\n(0)\n\u03a9DE\n\u03c1DM\n\u2212\u03b2\u03c60 /MPl\n\u2192e\n= exp \u2212\u03b1 (0)\n,\n(29)\n\u03c1CDM\n\u03a9\nDM\n\nwhere in the last step we have used Eq. (23).\nIt is reasonable to assume that this ratio cannot deviate too much from unity, for otherwise we risk running into conflict with estimates of the matter density at\nvarious redshifts, e.g. from galaxy counts, Lyman-\u03b1 forest, weak lensing etc. This is supported by the fact that\n(0)\nthe allowed range of \u03a9DM is almost independent of the\nspecifics of the dark energy, as derived from a general\nanalysis [6, 32] of the combined SNIa \"Gold\" data [7],\nWilkinson Anisotropy Microwave Probe (WMAP) power\nspectra [33] and Two-Degree Field (2dF) galaxy sur(0)\nvey [34]. In particular 0.23 <\n\u223c 0.33 at 2\u03c3 (see\n\u223c \u2206\u03a9DM <\n(0)\nalso [1, 35]). Substituting \u03a9DM = 0.33 in Eq. (29), we\nobtain\n\u03b1<\n\u223c 0.2 .\n\n(30)\n\nThus dark matter density estimates require the scalar\nfield potential to be sufficiently flat, thereby making the\nattractor behavior and slow-roll condition discussed in\nSec. III more easily satisfied.\nEquation (29) shows that \u03c1DM redshifts like normal\nCDM (i.e., \u03c1DM \u223c a\u22123 ) for most of the cosmological\nhistory, except in the recent past. This is crucial in satis(0)\nfying constraints on \u03a9DM and traces back to our choice of\ninverse power-law potential. In contrast, the exponential\n\nCMB and SNIa observables\n\nWe now focus on cosmological distance tests, in particular the SNIa luminosity-distance relation and the\nangular-diameter distance to the last scattering surface\nas inferred from the position of CMB acoustic peaks.\nWe wish to compare these observables for three different\nmodels, namely the interacting scalar field dark matter\nmodel with \u03b1 = 0.2 and \u03b2 = 1, a \u039bCDM model, and a\nphantom model with w = \u22121.2.\nThe position of Doppler peaks depends on the angulardiameter distance to the last scattering surface,\nZ zrec\ndz\n,\n(32)\ndA (zrec ) = (1 + zrec )\u22121\nH(z)\n0\nwhere zrec is the redshift at recombination. Observations\nof SNIa, on the other hand, probe the luminosity distance\nZ z\ndz\n.\n(33)\ndL (z) = (1 + z)\nH(z)\n0\nFigure 2a shows the luminosity distance for all three\n(0)\nmodels with \u03a9DM = 0.3, while Fig. 2b gives their percentage difference. The difference between our model and\n\u039bCDM is <\n\u223c 4% for z < 1.5; similarly the difference with\nrespect to the phantom model is within <\n\u223c 2%. Thus all\nthree models are degenerate within the uncertainties of\npresent SNIa data which determine dL (z) to no better\nthan \u223c 7%. Furthermore, this suggests that percentlevel accuracy from future SNIa experiments such as the\nSupernova Acceleration Probe (SNAP) [36], combined\nwith other cosmological probes, could distinguish between them.\n(0)\nSince \u03a9DM is kept fixed in this case, the matter density\nin the interacting dark energy model differs in the past\nfrom that in the \u039bCDM and phantom cases, as seen from\nEq. (29). This results in a 10% difference in dA (zrec ),\nwhich is again within current CMB uncertainties.\n\n\f6\nSuppose we instead keep dA (zrec ) fixed, which essentially amounts to fixing the matter density at high red(0)\nshift. With \u03a9DM = 0.3 for both the \u039bCDM and phantom\n(0)\nmodels, this is achieved by setting \u03a9DM = 0.4 for our\nmodel. These values are compatible with current limits,\nas mentioned earlier. The resulting luminosity distances\nand percentage differences are plotted in Fig. 3. In this\ncase we find that our model is more closely degenerate\nwith \u039bCDM than phantom.\n\n(0)\n\nFIG. 3: Same as in Figure 2, except \u03a9DM = 0.4 for the interacting scalar field dark matter model in this case.

Lower panel shows the percentage difference\nbetween our model and phantom (dash-dot), and between\nour model and \u039bCDM (dash), respectively.\n\nC.\n\nGrowth of density perturbations\n\nIn the slow-roll approximation the evolution equation\nfor dark matter inhomogeneities, \u03b4 = \u03b4\u03c1DM /\u03c1DM , is given\nin synchronous gauge by [20]\n\n\u22121/2\nV,\u03c6\u03c6\n\n=\n\ns\n\n\u03c6\u03b1+2\n\u03b1 .\n\u03b1(\u03b1 + 1)M 4 MPl\n\n(35)\n\nPerturbations with physical wavelength much larger\nthan \u03bb, i.e. a/k \u226b \u03bb, evolve as normal CDM. On the\nother hand, perturbations with a/k \u226a \u03bb, evolve as if\nNewton's constant were a factor of 1 + 2\u03b2 2 larger. Thus\nthe interaction with the quintessence field leads to an enhancement of power on small scales [37]. In particular,\nsmall-scale perturbations go non-linear at higher redshift\nthan in \u039bCDM, as shown recently in a closely related\ncontext of chameleon cosmology [38]. (Numerical simulations have also found that a similar attractive scalar\ninteraction for dark matter particles, albeit with a much\nsmaller range of 1 Mpc, results in emptier voids between\nconcentrations of large galaxies [39].)\nQuantitatively, from Eqs. (23) and (24) in the limit\n\u03b1 \u226a 1, we obtain\n(0)\n\n\u03b4 \u2032\u2032 + aH\u03b4 \u2032 =\n\n\u0014\n\n2\n\n\u0015\n\n3 2 2\n2\u03b2\n\u03b4,\na H 1+\n2\n1 + a2 V,\u03c6\u03c6 /k 2\n\n(34)\n\nwhere primes denote differentiation with respect to conformal time. This differs from the corresponding expression in CDM models only through the factor in square\nbrackets, normally equal to unity. Since this term accounts for the self-attractive force on the perturbation,\nthe extra contribution proportional to \u03b2 2 arises from the\nattractive fifth force mediated by the scalar field. This\nforce has a finite range, which for an inverse power-law\n\nV,\u03c6\u03c6 \u2248 H02 (1 + z)6 e2\u03b2(\u03c6\u2212\u03c60 )/MPl\n\n3\u03b2 2 (\u03a9DM )2\n,\n\u03b1 \u03a9(0)\n\n(36)\n\nDE\n\nwhere H0 is the present value of the Hubble parameter.\nThis implies, for instance, that at the present epoch\nv\nu\nu \u03b1\u03a9(0)\n\u22121 t\n(0)\nDE\n\u2248 0.7H0\u22121 ,\n(37)\n\u03bb = H0\n(0)\n3\u03b2 2 (\u03a9DM )2\n\nwhere in the last step we have taken \u03b1 = 0.2, \u03b2 = 1 and\n(0)\n\u03a9DM = 0.3. Hence the present range of this fifth force is\n\n\f7\ncomparable to the size of the observable universe. However, \u03bb varies with redshift, and it is easily seen that\n\u03bb \u226a H \u22121 in the past. In particular, we do not expect\nmeasurable effects in the CMB. This is in contrast with\nquintessence models [4], as well as the interacting dark\nmatter/dark energy model of Amendola and collaborators [18], where m \u223c H along the attractor solution,\nleading to imprints in the CMB.\nWe solve numerically Eq. (34) and compute the linear\nmatter power spectrum, \u22062 (k) \u221d k 3 P (k), normalized to\nWMAP [33], where P (k) = |\u03b4k |2 . In Fig. 4a we plot the\nresulting power spectrum for our model (solid line) and\n(0)\n\u039bCDM (dash line) with \u03a9DM = 0.4 and 0.3 respectively.\nThe two curves are essentially indistinguishable by eye.\nIn Fig. 4b we plot the fractional difference between\nthe two spectra. The discrepancy is < 2% on the\nscales probed by current large scale structure surveys\nand consistent with the experimental accuracy of 2dF\nGalaxy Redshift Survey [34] and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) [40]. On large scales the perturbations in the\ntwo models evolve in a similar way (k < 0.01 hMpc\u22121 ),\nwhile on intermediate scales (0.01 < k < 0.4 hMpc\u22121 )\nthe \u039bCDM shows a few percent excess of power which is\nmostly due to small difference in the expansion rate of\nthe two models after decoupling. Most importantly, on\nsmaller scales (k > 0.4 hMpc\u22121 ) the power spectrum of\n\u039bCDM is suppressed compared to our model. This is due\nto the fifth force which enhances the clustering of dark\nmatter perturbations compared to the uncoupled case.\nHowever, in this range perturbations become non-linear;\nhence a rigorous study of how this fifth force affects structure formation requires N-body simulations.\n\nD.\n\nGalaxy and cluster dynamics\n\nSince the \u03c6-mediated force is long-range today (see\nEq. (37)), our model is subject to constraints from galaxy\nand cluster dynamics [37]. For instance, a fifth force in\nthe dark sector leads to a discrepancy in mass estimates\nof a cluster acting as a strong lens for a high-redshift\ngalaxy. Lensing measurements probe the actual mass\nsince photons are oblivious to the fifth force, while dynamical observations are affected and would overestimate\nthe mass of the cluster.\nOther effects studied in [37] include mass-to-light ratios in the Local Group, rotation curves of galaxies in\nclusters, and dynamics of rich clusters. These combine to\nyield a constraint of \u03b2 <\n\u223c 0.8, consistent with our assumption of \u03b2 \u223c O(1). This is consistent with generic string\ncompactifications; if for instance \u03c6 is the radion field measuring the\n\u221a distance between two end-of-the-world branes,\n\u03b2 = 1/ 6 [20].\n\nFIG. 4: Upper panel shows the matter power spectrum\n(\u22062 (k)) over the relevant range of scales for our model (solid)\n(0)\nand \u039bCDM (dash) with \u03a9DM = 0.4 and 0.3, respectively.\nLower panel shows the percentage difference between the two\ncurves, which is well within current experimental accuracy.\n\nVI.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper we have shown that an interaction between dark matter and dark energy generically mimics\nw < \u22121 cosmology, provided that the observer treats the\ndark matter as non-interacting. Unlike phantom models,\nthe theory is well-defined and free of ghosts.\nOur model is consistent with current observations provided the scalar potential is sufficiently flat. For our\nfiducial V (\u03c6) = M 4 /\u03c6\u03b1 , this translates into \u03b1 <\n\u223c 0.2.\nThis is no worse than normal quintessence with tracker\npotential, where a nearly identical bound follows from\nobservational constraints on w\u03c6 .\nIn fact our scenario is less constrained than other interacting dark energy/dark matter models studied in the literature. There is no need to introduce a non-interacting\nDM component, as in [24]; nor does the coupling strength\nneed be much weaker than gravity, \u03b2 <\n\u223c 0.1, as in [18].\nInstead, our model allows for a single interacting DM\nspecies with gravitational strength coupling to dark energy - \u03b2 \u223c O(1). In both cases this traces back to a\ndifference in attractor solutions.\nAt the level of current uncertainties, the model is degenerate with both \u039bCDM and phantom models. However, our calculations of luminosity and angular-diameter\ndistances indicate that these models could be distinguished by the next generation of cosmological experiments devoted to the study of dark energy, such as SNAP,\nthe Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) [41], the\nJoint Efficient Dark-energy Investigation (JEDI) [42], the\n\n\f8\nAdvanced Liquid-mirror Probe for Astrophysics, Cosmology and Asteroids (ALPACA) [43], and others.\nA dark sector interaction may reveal itself in various\nways in the data. A strong hint would be a preference for\nw < \u22121 when fitting cosmological distance measurements\nassuming CDM. Another indication is a discrepancy between the clustering matter density at various redshifts\nand the expected (1 + z)3 dependence in normal CDM\nmodels, which could appear as a discrepancy in the in(0)\nferred value of \u03a9M .\nWe also uncovered modifications in the linear matter\npower spectrum and large-scale structure. These are primarily due to the attractive scalar-mediated force which\nenhances the growth of DM perturbations on small scales.\nNote that the opposite behavior obtains for a phantom\nscalar coupled to dark matter, resulting in a repulsive\nscalar force which damps perturbations [44]. As mentioned earlier, non-linear effects are important for the\nrelevant range of scales and would require N-body simulations.\nOther observational effects that could distinguish our\nmodel from \u039bCDM and phantom include the bias parameter. Since baryons are unaffected by the fifth\nforce, baryon fluctuations develop a constant large-scale\n\nbias [45] which could be observable. Similarly, comparison of the redshift dependence of the matter power spectrum, P (k, z), may be useful to constrain the scale \u03bb,\nwhich varies with z. Moreover, it has recently been argued that dark sector interactions could lead to oscillations in the redshift dependence of cluster counts [46].\nThe integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect is another mechanism\nworth studying. Since the present range of our scalar\nforce is comparable to the size of the observable universe,\nit might account for the observed lack of power on large\nscales in the CMB.\n\n[1] U.
