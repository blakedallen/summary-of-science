There has been a growing interest to\n\n1\n\n\finvestigate the solutions of subdiffusive equations and their properties for various reasons which include\nmodeling of anomalous diffusive and subdiffusive systems, description of fractional random walk, unification of\ndiffusion and wave propagation phenomenon, and simplification of the results. The common methods for\nsolving fractional-order equations are purely mathematical [13], even tough they are approximate in nature,\namong them: in terms of Mittag\u2013Leffler function [14] , similarity solutions [15] , Green's function [16,17]\n,operational calculus [18] , numerical methods [19] , variational iteration method [20,21], and differential\ntransformations [22,23] .\nThe present work refers to an integral solution commonly known as heat-balance integral [24] to the\nfractional subdiffusion equation expressed generally as\n\nDt \u03bc T ( x, t ) = b\n\n\u2202 \u03b2 T ( x, t )\n\u2202x \u03b2\n\n(1)\n\nThe solution was performed with Riemann \u2013Liouville time-fractional derivative since the integral approach\navoids the definition of the initial ( t = 0 ) value of the time-derivative in the Laplace transformed equation and\nconsequent transition to Caputo derivatives. The method is demonstrated by solutions to two simple fractional\nsubdiffusion equations (Dirichlet problems):\n1. Time-Fractional Drift Equation, with 0 < \u03bc < 1 , \u03b2 = 1 and b = \u2212V\u03bc < 0\n2. Time-Fractional Diffusion Equation, with 0 < \u03bc < 1 , \u03b2 = 2 and b = a\u03bc > 0\nThe integral solution suggests a prescribed profile with unknown coefficients satisfying the boundary\nconditions at the both ends of the penetration layer. The integral approach to the fractional equation suggests\nreplacement of the real function by an approximate profile and integration over the penetration depth. The\ntechnique was demonstrated recently [25] in a solution of a hall-time fractional equation resulting by splitting of\nthe normal (diffusion) parabolic equation and Riemann-Liouville time-derivative and to radial subdiffusion from\ncentral point source through a sphere [26]. Both of them have fundamental solutions expressed through the MWrite function [27,28] .The solutions demonstrate some basic issues of the suggested integral approach, among\nthem: a) Choice of the profile, b) Integration problem emerging when the distribution (profile) is replaced by a\nprescribed one with unknown coefficients; c) Optimization of the profile in view to minimize the average error\nof approximations; d) Numerical results allowing comparisons to the known solutions expressed to the M-Write\nfunction and error estimations.\n\n2. The integral method -mathematical formulation.\nIt is assumed that the temperature (concentration) T ( x, t ) in the semi-infinite subdiffusive material\nsatisfies the one-dimensional fractional equation (1) with \u03b2 = 2 and\n\n2\n\n\f\u2202 \u03bc T ( x, t )\n\u2202t \u03bc\n\nT ( 0, t ) = Ts\n\n, t\u22650 ;\n\n= a\u03bc\n\n\u2202 2T ( x , t )\n\nT ( x,0 ) = T\u221e , x > 0 ;\n\nd \u03bc T dt \u03bc =\n\n(2a)\n\n\u2202x 2\n\n\u2202T ( x,0 )\n\u2202t\n\n\u03bc\nRL Dt T ( x, t ) =\n\n=0, x>0\n\n(2b,c,d)\n\nt\n1\nd T ( x, u )\ndu\n\u0393 (1 \u2212 \u03bc ) dt \u222b0 ( t \u2212 u ) \u03bc\n\n(2e)\n\nAs it was mentioned at the beginning, the integral approach considers a finite depth of penetration \u03b4 of where\na\u03bc is a sort of fractional diffusion coefficient of dimensions \uf8ee\uf8f0 a\u03bc \uf8f9\uf8fb = \uf8ee\uf8f0 m 2 sec \u03bc \uf8f9\uf8fb\n\nand (2e) is the Riemann-\n\nLiouville fractional derivative of T ( x, t ) with respect to the time t [18].\nThe temperature (concentration) into the medium evolves in time, i.e. \u03b4 ( t ) . Beyond the point x = \u03b4 ( t ) ,\nthe medium is undisturbed and\n\n\u2202T (\u03b4 , t )\n\nT ( x, \u03b4 ) = T\u221e , x > \u03b4 ;\n\n\u2202x\n\n= 0 ; \u03b4 ( t ) = 0, t = 0\n\n(3a,b,c)\n\nThis approach is supported be experimental facts of almost sharp fronts of penetration of the diffusion\nsubstances [6, 7, 29, 30]. Moreover, the fractional diffusion equation referring sub-diffusion problems [6] the\nheat (mass) propagation (diffusion) is so slow [8, 30, 31] that the concept of the penetration layer becomes\nessential in view of the fact that it really exists [6,7,29, 30]. In accordance with the heat-balance concept at any\ntime t the integral of both sides (1a) along \u03b4 should be\n\u03b4\n\n\uf8ee \u2202\u03bc\n\uf8f9\n\u2202T\n\u222b0 \uf8ef\uf8f0 \u2202t \u03bc T ( x, t )\uf8fa\uf8fb dx = a\u03bc \u2202x\n\n\u03b4\n\n(4a)\nx =0\n\nThe integral of left-side in (4a) is termed hereafter \u2013 fractional-time Heat-balance Integral (FT-HBI)\n[25, 26]. If the distribution T ( x, t ) across the penetration is approximated by Ta ( x ) depending only on x ,\n0 < x < \u03b4 ( t ) and the boundary conditions (3a, b) and (2b) are applied , then we get a profile (distribution)\nexpressed as a function of x and coefficients depending on \u03b4 ( t ) . Replacing T ( x, t ) by Ta ( x, \u03b4 ) , in (4a) we get\n\n\u2202Ta ( x, \u03b4 ( t ) ) a\n\uf8ee \u2202\u03bc\n\uf8f9\n\u222b0 \uf8ef\uf8f0 \u2202t \u03bc Ta ( x, \u03b4 ( t ) )\uf8fa\uf8fb dx = a\u03bc\n\u2202x\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b4\n\n(4b)\nx =0\n\nNow, the main problem is the evaluation of the fractional heat-balance integral (4b) through particular\nexpression of Ta ( x, \u03b4 ) and the definition of the fractional-time derivative.\n\u03bc\nRL Dt Ta ( x, \u03b4 ( t ) ) =\n\n1\nd Ta ( x, \u03b4 ( t ) ,\u03c4 )\nd\u03c4\n\u0393 (1 \u2212 \u03bc ) dt \u222b0 ( t \u2212 \u03c4 ) \u03bc\nt\n\n(5)\n\n3\n\n\fThe crux of the fractional heat-balance integral is the left-hand side of (4a) since the distribution\nTa ( x, t ) should satisfy the integral in average, but not the original domain equation (2a). The second principle\npoint is the choice of the approximating profile Ta ( x ) , which is commonly expressed as a polynomial function\nof integer order: quadratic or cubic [24]. Here we will use a generalized parabolic profile\nTa ( x, t ) = b1 + b2 (1 + b3 x ) with unspecified exponent [25, 26, 32,33] and T ( 0, t ) = Ts as boundary condition at\nn\n\nx = 0 . Applying the boundary conditions (3a, b) and (2b) to the approximate profile we get\n\nx\uf8f6\nT \u2212 T\u221e \uf8eb\nx\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nTa ( x, t ) = T\u221e + (Ts \u2212 T\u221e ) \uf8ec1 \u2212 \uf8f7 \u21d2 \u0398a ( x, t ) =\n= \uf8ec1 \u2212 \uf8f7\nTs \u2212 T\u221e \uf8ed \u03b4 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed \u03b4\uf8f8\nn\n\nn\n\n(6)\n\nThe approximate parabolic profile satisfies the conditions imposed at the boundaries of the penetration\nlayer and the heat-balance integral at any value of exponent n as it was discussed in [25, 26, 32, 33]. The exact\nvalue of the exponent n should be defined through additional conditions addressing minimization of the\napproximation error over the entire domain [25,26] as it is discussed further is this article regarding the\nparticular problems at issue.\n\n3 Fractional-time Heat-balance Integral\n\nThe next important step is to evaluate the time-fractional derivative of (5) replacing T ( x, t ) by the\napproximate distribution Ta ( x, t ) , that is, the following integral has to be solved\n\u03b4\n\uf8ee \u2202\u03bc\n\uf8f9\nI fr = \u222b \uf8ef \u03bc Ta ( x, t ) \uf8fa dx\n\u2202t\n\uf8fb\n0\uf8f0\n\n(7)\n\nThe problems was conceived and developed in [25] and the solution of (7) with \u03bc = 1 2 was expressed as\nI afr (1 2) =\n\n2\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1 d\n\u03b4 t .

Fractional drift equation\n4.3.2.1 Mean-square error approach and fixed exponents\nThe condition, the fractional drift equation to satisfy the domain equation reads\nE\u03bc (t ) \u2261\nd\n\n\u03b4 (t )\n\n\u222b\n0\n\n2\n\n\uf8ee \u2202\u03bc d\n\u2202\u0398 da \uf8f9\nd\n\u0398\nx\n,\nt\n+\nV\n(\n)\n\u03bc\n\uf8ef \u03bc a\n\uf8fa dx \u2265 0, E \u03bc ( t ) \u2192 min\n\u2202\nt\n\u2202\nx\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n\n(18a)\n\nWith the dimensionless profile (14a) we have (see the expression (9) for \u2202 \u03bc \u2202 t \u03bc )\n\n\uf8ee 1\n\uf8f9\n\u2202\u03bc d\n1\n1 d\n\u0398 a ( x, t ) =\n\u03b4 t1\u2212 \u03bc ) \uf8fa = V\u03bc nd\n(\n\uf8ef\n\u03bc\n\u2202t\n\u0393 (1 \u2212 \u03bc ) \uf8f0\uf8ef (1 \u2212 \u03bc ) n + 1 dt\n\uf8fb\uf8fa\nBecause \u03b4 \u03bc = V\u03bc t \u03bc Fnd j\u03bcd ,\n\n(19a)\n\nj\u03bcd = \u0393 ( 2 \u2212 \u03bc ) and Fnd = nd ( nd + 1) we get\n\nFurther, the drift term is\n\n\u2202\u0398 da\nn \uf8eb\nx \uf8f6\n= \u2212V\u03bc d \uf8ec1 \u2212 \uf8f7\n\u2202x\n\u03b4d \uf8ed \u03b4d \uf8f8\n\nnd \u22121\n\n1 \uf8eb\nx \uf8f6\ne\u03bc ( x, t ) = V\u03bc nd \u2212 V\u03bc nd\n\uf8ec1 \u2212 \uf8f7\n\u03b4d \uf8ed \u03b4d \uf8f8\nd\n\n(19b)\nnd \u22121\n\nnd \u22121\n\uf8ee\n1 \uf8eb\nx \uf8f6 \uf8f9\n= V\u03bc nd \uf8ef1 \u2212 \uf8ec1 \u2212 \uf8f7 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\uf8f0 \u03b4 d \uf8ed \u03b4 d \uf8f8 \uf8fa\uf8fb\n\n(19c)\n\nHence, the error decreases as the penetration depth \u03b4 d evolves in time. This error is always positive because\n\n7\n\n\f1 \u2212 x \u03b4 d \u2265 0 , so the integration over the penetration depth of \uf8ee\uf8f0e\u03bcd ( x, t ) \uf8f9\uf8fb is\n2\n\nV\u03bc t \u03bc j\u03bc nd ( nd + 1) +\n\n1\n1\n\u2212\nV\u03bc t j\u03bc nd ( nd + 1)( 2nd \u2212 1) nd\n\u03bc\n\n(20)\n\nThe solution to (20) with respect to nd is hard to be developed in a general form because the first two\nterms depends on the time t \u03bc . The second term decreases in time, so we address the first term which becomes\n\n2V\u03bc t \u03bc j\u03bc with the minimal value of the exponent nd = 1 taking into account that exponents of the parabolic\nprofile should be n \u2265 1 . With nd = 1 , for example, we have a linear profile with respect to the similarity\nvariable \u03b7d =\n\nx\n. These results are shown in Fig. 5a. Obviously, the prediction by the linear profile is\nV\u03bc t \u03bc\n\nunsatisfactory. Simple numerical tests with \u03bc = 1 2 (see the other curves in Fig.5a reveals that with increase in\nthe value of nd the approximate profiles approaches the exact solution expressed through the M-Wright function\n[27]\n\nM 1 2 \u2261 exp\u2212 ( x 2 4V\u03bc2t ) ,\n\n(21)\n\nThe best fits where detected with nd = 1.75 in the range of . 2.25 \u2264 \u03b7d \u2264 5 as it is discussed in the next\nsection concerning numerical experiments. The calculations were performed with Maple 13.\nSimilar tests with \u03bc = 1 3 ( see Fig. 5b) show that the approximate profile with nd = 1.25 within the range\n\n0 \u2264 \u03b7 d \u2264 1.25 matches the exact solution [27]\n\uf8eb\u03b7 \uf8f6\nM 1 3 = 32 3 Ai \uf8ec 1d3 \uf8f7 ,\n\uf8ed3 \uf8f8\n\nAi ( 0 ) =\n\n1\n3 \u0393 ( 2 3)\n23\n\n(22)\n\nquite well Ai is the Airy function[27]. On the other hand, where 4 \u2264 \u03b7d \u2264 5.5 the best approximate solutions\nare provided by parabolic profiles with nd = 1.75 and nd = 2 .\nTherefore, these simple numerical tests indicate that the profile exponent should be of variable-order (or\ndistributed order) depending on the similarity variable. The numerical experiments reported in the next section\nclearly in show the effect of the fixed exponent on the accuracy of approximation.\n\n4.3.2.2. Fractional drift equation: numerical tests\nIn the context of the outcomes of the previous point a series of numerical test with \u03bc = 1 2 and\n\n\u03bc = 1 3 were performed to test the effect of the effect of the exponent nd on the accuracy of the approximation.\nThe results are summarized in Table 2 and Table 3 spanning variations of the similarity variable \u03b7d from 0.1 to\n\n8\n\n\f6 and 1 \u2264 nd \u2264 6 . The upper limit of nd shown in Table 2 and Table 3 is about nd = 2.25 and corresponds to\nan error of approximation 4.5% over the entire range of variations in the value of \u03b7d . Recall, the classical heatbalance integral method [24] provides solution with an average errors of 8 \u2212 9% . The results summarized in\nTable 2 reveal that varying the value of the exponent nd within the range 1.75 \u2264 nd \u2264 2.5 the mentioned above\naccuracy of approximation was attained (the values closest to the exact solution are highlighted). Increasing the\nvalue nd beyond nd = 2.5 up to nd = 5 reduces the error of approximation to 1.5% over the range\n\n0.1 \u2264 \u03b7 d \u2264 2 (these results are not shown in Table. 2. While the values of the optimal nd (1 2) decreases with\nincrease in the value of the similarity variable \u03b7d , the case of \u03bc = 1 3 (see Table 3) reveals that maintaining the\ndesired accuracy of approximation the exponent nd (1 3) should increase as the similarity variable increases. In\nthe sub- range 0.3 \u2264 \u03b7d \u2264 2 the best approximation was provided by a profile with nd (1 3) \u2248 1.25 as it is\nillustrated by the plots in Fig.5b, too. Similar results were observed with nd (1 2) \u2248 1.75 when \u03b7d > 2.5 and\n\nnd (1 2 ) \u2248 1.5 for \u03b7d < 1 . Obviously, these trial-error numerical tests reveal tendencies in the dependence\nnd (\u03b7 d ) in two particular cases where the exact solutions through the M-Wright function can be easily\nexpressed. Numerical tests with two suggested continuous function nd (\u03b7 d ) are discussed in the next section..\n\n4.3.2.32. Fractional drift equation: numerical tests with variable-order exponents\nThe idea raised by the numerical experiments with fixed exponents nd commented above led to two ad hoc\nsuggested forms of the functional relationship nd (\u03b7d , \u03bc ) tested with \u03bc = 1 2 and \u03bc = 1 3 , namely :\n\u2022\n\nHyperbolic relationship\n\nnd (\u03b7 d , \u03bc ) = nd 0 +\n\u2022\n\n\u03bc\n\u03b7d\n\n(25)\n\nInverse exponential relationship\n\nnd (\u03b7 d , \u03bc ) = nd 0 + \u03bc\n\n\u03b7d\nexp (\u03b7d )\n\n(26)\n\nThe plots of the approximate profiles with various initial values of the exponent nd 0 and the exact profiles are\nshown in Fig.6a-d demonstrating the more suitable approximations that those with fixed exponents. However,\nthe problem is still open because either the initial value nd 0 or the distributed order functions are still ad hoc\nchosen ones. However, this draws a future problem beyond the scope of the present work.\n\n9\n\n\fAdditional numerical text performed with the almost optimal fixed exponents and showing the effect of\nthe drift velocity V\u03bc (Fig.7a) and the time (Fig.7b) were performed, too. All these plots are physically adequate\nbut require further analysis of the approximation errors which is a matter beyond the scope of the present work.\n\n5. Final Comments\nThe approximate solutions of the fractional subdiffusion and drift equations performed by the fractionaltime Integral-balance method generate distributions approaching those expressed through the M-Wright\nfunction. The method is simple and easily applicable. However, the problem still open in its complete\napplication is the choice of the exponent of the approximate parabolic profile. In the case of the subdiffusion\nequation the problem was solved in average by the mean-square error approach even though the cumbersome\nexpressions of the functional relationship that has to be minimized. However, with the fractional drift equation\nthis approached failed but there are some grounds for optimism through the distributed-order exponent. This\nproblem is still undeveloped but some ideas could be taken from already developed solutions of the normal\n(Fickian) equation [32, 33] that draw future studies.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe work was supported by the grant N10751/2010 of Univ.
