EPSTEIN\nAbstract. Phantom depth, phantom nonzerodivisors, and phantom exact\nsequences are analogues of the non-\"phantom\" notions which have been useful\nin tackling the (very difficult) localization problem in tight closure theory.

Also,\nwe give alternate characterizations of the notion of phantom depth, including\none based on Koszul homology which we use to show that with very mild\nconditions on a finitely generated module M , any two maximal phantom M regular sequences in an ideal I have the same length. In order to do so, we\nprove a \"Nakayama lemma for tight closure\" which is of independent interest.\nWe strengthen the connection of phantom depth with minheight, we explore\nseveral analogues of \"associated prime\" in tight closure theory, and we discuss a\nconnection with the problem of when tight closure commutes with localization.\n\nContents\n1.

For general references on\ncommutative algebra for terms not explained, I recommend the excellent books by\nMatsumura [Mat86] and Bruns & Herzog [BH97].\nOne of the many good properties of the tight closure operation is colon capturing.\nThat is, for any system of parameters x1 , . . . , xd in a local ring (R, m) satisfying mild\nconditions, (x1 , . . . , xi\u22121 ) : xi \u2286 (x1 , . . . , xi\u22121 )\u2217 for i = 1, . . . , d.[Hun96, Theorems\n3.1 and 3.1A] In Mel Hochster's words, tight closure \"captures the failure\" of a\nsystem of parameters to be a regular sequence for R. Said another way, any system\nof parameters for R is an R-regular sequence \"up to tight closure\". It is natural\nto ask the question: For an R-module M , what sort of sequences in an ideal I are,\nsimilarly, M -regular \"up to tight closure\"?\nAberbach introduces this question in [Abe94] and assigns the description phantom M -regular to such a sequence, appropriately defined. In addition to basic\nproperties of phantom M -regular sequences and their companion invariant, phantom depth, Aberbach also connects the notion from the title of his paper (phantom\nprojective dimension) with phantom depth in an elegant formula. Namely, he proves\na phantom Auslander-Buchsbaum theorem, in which, with mild conditions on the\nring, the word \"phantom\" is placed in front of every occurrence of the word \"depth\"\nand the phrase \"projective dimension\" in the statement of Auslander and Buchsbaum's classical theorem. The phantom projective dimension of M is the length\nof the shortest stably phantom acyclic complex (i.e. a complex which is acyclic\nup to tight closure and Frobenius powers; see [HH90] and Section 2 of this paper) of finitely-generated projective modules whose zero'th homology module is M .\nAberbach, Hochster, and Huneke [AHH93] use Aberbach's phantom AuslanderBuchsbaum theorem to obtain some of the best results to date on the difficult\nlocalization problem in tight closure theory.\nIn this work, we investigate phantom depth and stable phantom properties of\ncomplexes further. Nearly all of the previously existing theorems that use phantom\ndepth rely on the phantom Auslander-Buchsbaum theorem, which means that they\nonly apply to modules of finite phantom projective dimension. In several cases (see\nSection 7), I have been able to remove this restriction. Also, I am able to give a\npositive answer (in Corollary 4.11) to a question posed by Aberbach: With mild\nconditions on the ring, all maximal phantom M -regular sequences in a proper ideal\nI have the same length.\nMy results rest on three fundamental tools. First, I develop a technique for\ntreating a short stably phantom exact sequence of complexes in a way analogous\nto the way one treats a short exact sequence of complexes. I do not obtain a long\nexact sequence, or even a long stably phantom exact sequence, but I can mimic the\nresults we would expect if we had such a long sequence. The minimal amount of\nthis technique necessary for the bulk of the paper is developed in Section 2. I give\na more detailed version, for both tight and Frobenius closures (in Sections 8 and\n10, respectively). Secondly, I prove tight closure versions of the Nakayama lemma\n(in Section 3). Thirdly, I define \"ghost M -regular sequences\", which coincide with\nphantom M -regular sequences in all cases of interest (see Proposition 4.4) but are\noften easier to use than the latter. With these tools, I obtain characterizations of\nphantom depth (Theorem 4.7) and phantom M -regular sequences (Theorem 5.4)\nin terms of stable phantomness, rather than vanishing, of Koszul homology. In\n\n\fPHANTOM DEPTH AND STABLE PHANTOM EXACTNESS.\n\n3\n\nSection 9, I give an analogue of right exactness and show that it interfaces with\nphantom regular sequences in the expected way.\n1.1. Tight closure background. In order to define tight closure, we first need\nto explain about Frobenius powers: For a finitely generated module M over such\na ring R with maximal ideal m, and for any nonnegative integer e \u2265 0, we denote\nthe following concept by the symbol F e (M ): Let e R be the additive abelian group\nR whose R-R bimodule structure is given by a * z * b = abq z, where a, b \u2208 R and\nz \u2208 e R. Then F e (M ) is the (left) R-module e R \u2297R M . Clearly this makes F e a\nright-exact functor on the category of R-modules. Now, let\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c0\n\nRn \u2192 Rm \u2192 M \u2192 0\nbe a finite free presentation of M . Let q = pe . If we fix bases for the free modules\nRn and Rm , we get a corresponding representation of \u03c6 as a matrix A = (aij ) with\nentries in m. Let A[q] be the matrix whose (i, j)'th entry is aqij , for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m, 1 \u2264\nj \u2264 n. Then F e (\u03c6) : Rn \u2192 Rm is the map of free modules represented by the matrix\nA[q] , so that, since F e is right-exact, F e (M ) = coker F e (\u03c6). Moreover, for any z \u2208\nM , there exists y \u2208 Rm such that \u03c0(y) = z. Let \u03c0 \u2032 : Rm \u2192 F e (M ) = coker F e (\u03c6)\nbe the natural surjection from Rm induced by F e (\u03c6). Then set z q := \u03c0 \u2032 (y). The\nq\nnotation would be more precise if we were to write zM\ninstead of z q . However, we\nq\nq\nshall use the convention that for any element z, z will denote zM\n, where M is the\nlargest module of those mentioned that contain z as an element. Other than that,\nall of the foregoing is functorial and independent of all choices. If N is a submodule\n[q]\nof M , let i : N \u2192 M be the inclusion. Then NM , the \"q'th Frobenius power of N\nin M ,\" is defined to be the image of the map F e (i) : F e (N ) \u2192 F e (M ).\nAs for tight closure: If N \u2286 M are finitely-generated R-modules, then we say\nthat an element z \u2208 M is in the tight closure of N with respect to M , and we\n\u2217\nwrite z \u2208 NM\n, if there exists some c \u2208 R, which is not in any minimal prime of\n[q]\nR, such that for all sufficiently large powers q of p, cz q \u2208 NM . For any e \u2265 0,\ne\ne\n\u2217\nwe let G (M ) = F (M )/0F e (M) , and we call it the q'th reduced Frobenius power of\nM . If there is some c \u2208 R, not in any minimal prime of R, and some power q0 of\np such that for all finitely-generated R-modules M and all submodules N \u2286 M ,\n[q]\n\u2217\nz \u2208 NM\nif and only if cz q \u2208 NM for all powers q of p such that q \u2265 q0 , then\nwe say that c is a q0 -weak test element for R. If c is a q0 -weak test element for\nRp for every p \u2208 Spec R, then it is called a locally stable q0 -weak test element for\nR. If there exists some power q0 of p for which c is a (locally stable) q0 -weak test\nelement, we say that c is a (locally stable) weak test element. One of the loveliest\naccomplishments of tight closure theory is the theorem of Hochster and Huneke\n[HH94, Theorem 7.32] which says among other things that if R is excellent and\nlocal (which is not a very restrictive condition; for instance any complete local ring\nis excellent, as is any algebra essentially of finite type over a field), then it has a\nlocally stable weak test element. Unless otherwise noted, all rings in this paper will\ncontain a q0 -weak test element c.\n2. Coping without authentic long exact sequences\nThe fact that a short exact sequence of complexes leads to a long exact sequence is\na central tool in the homological theory of modules over a ring. When investigating\nphantom regular sequences (as we begin to do in Section 4) we obtain sequences\n\n\f4\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN\n\nwhich are right-exact and \"stably phantom exact\" on the left. In this section we\nderive just the information (the content of Proposition 2.3) that we need from such\na sequence to prove Lemma 4.10, a key step in the proof of Theorem 4.7, a main\nresult of this paper. This information is similar to some of what we would obtain\nfrom a true long exact sequence. In Section 8, we present a more fully developed\ntheory.\nNotation and conventions: Throughout this paper, we shall use the following convention linking the letters e and q: any variation of the letter q will be understood\nto be p to the power of e with the corresponding variation. For example, q0 = pe0 ,\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nq1 = pe1 , q \u2032 = pe , and q \u2032\u2032 = pe .\nIn a notational abbreviation which we shall use throughout the paper, given q0\nand a fixed q0 -weak test element c, recursively define cn for integers n \u2265 \u22121 by the\nrules:\nc\u22121 = 1\nand\ncn+1 = c * cnq0 ,\n2\n\nIn particular, c0 = c, c1 = cq0 +1 , c2 = cq0 +q0 +1 , etc. This is useful because\nwhenever A \u2286 B are finitely generated R-modules and cn z \u2208 A\u2217B , it follows that\n[q ]\ncn+1 z q0 = c(cn z)q0 \u2208 AB0 .\nIf M. is a complex of R-modules, then the i'th differential is denoted dM\ni , the i'th\nmodule of cycles is Zi (M.) := ker dM\nand\nthe\ni'th\nboundary\nmodule\nis\nBi (M.) :=\ni\nim dM\n.\ni+1\nIn this section and in Section 8, to simplify notation, we will abuse it by assuming\nthe reader can keep track of the Frobenius powers on the maps. In particular,\nif g : X \u2192 Y is a map of R-modules, g will denote F e (g) for some e, and if\nM. is a complex of R-modules, dM\ni will denote some Frobenius power of the i'th\ndifferential of the complex M . Also in this section, we will mix homology with\nFrobenius powers: If \u03b1. : L. \u2192 M. is a map of complexes of R-modules and\ni \u2208 , then Hi (F e (\u03b1.)) denotes the map Hi (F e (L.)) \u2192 Hi (F e (M.)) induced by the\ncomposition of the i'th homology functor Hi with the Frobenius functor F e acting\non the map \u03b1. of complexes. An element of Hi (F e (\u03b1.)) will be denoted in brackets,\ne.g.: [x]. Combining all these conventions together, if x \u2208 ker F e (dL\ni ), then we\nwrite [x] \u2208 Hi (F e (L.)), and the symbols Hi (F e (\u03b1.))([x]) and [\u03b1i (x)] denote the\nsame element of Hi (F e (M.)).\n\nZ\n\nDefinition 2.1. [HH90] If M. is a complex of R-modules and i \u2208\nM. has stably phantom homology at the i'th spot (or at i) if\n\nZ, we say that\n\n\u2217\n\nZi (F e (M.)) \u2286 (Bi (F e (M.)))F e (Mi ) .\nfor all e \u2265 0. We say that a complex is stably phantom exact (resp. stably phantom\nacyclic) if it has stably phantom homology at every spot (resp. at every spot except\n0).\nWe say that an element [x] of Hi (M.) is phantom if for all e \u226b 0, cxq \u2208\nq\ne\nim F e (di+1\nM ) (i.e. [cx ] = 0 in Hi (F (M. ))).\nAt this point I collect together two easily proved Facts which will be used in the\nsequel without comment.\nFact 1: For any map \u03b2 : L \u2192 N of finitely generated R-modules and any e,\n[q]\nim F e (\u03b2) = (im \u03b2)N .\n\n\fPHANTOM DEPTH AND STABLE PHANTOM EXACTNESS.\n\n5\n[q]\n\nFact 2: For map \u03b2 : L \u2192 N of finitely generated R-modules and any e, (ker \u03b2)L \u2286\nker F e (\u03b2).\nNext, we have some characterizations of stably phantom homology:\nProposition 2.2. Let R be a Noetherian ring of prime characteristic p > 0 which\ncontains a q0 -weak test element c, let L. be a complex of finitely generated Rmodules. For any i \u2208 , the following are equivalent:\n\nZ\n\n(a) L. has stably phantom homology at i.\n(b) Hi (F e (L.)) \u2286 0\u2217\nF e (L.) for all e \u2265 0.\ncoker di+1\n\n[q ]\n\n0\n(c) For all e \u2265 0, c kills (Hi (F e (L.)))coker\nF e (dL\n\ni+1 )\n\n.\n\nProof. The equivalence of (a) and (b) is easy, so we prove the equivalence of (a)\nand (c).\nIf L. has stably phantom homology at i, then for any e and any [z] \u2208 Hi (F e (L.)),\nq0\nq0\nwe have that cz q0 \u2208 im F e+e0 (dL\ni+1 ), which means that c[z]coker F e (dL ) = [cz ] = 0.\ni+1\n\nConversely, suppose (c) is true. Take any [x] \u2208 Hi (F e (L.)). Then for all powers\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nq of p, [xq ] \u2208 Hi (F e+e (L.)), so that by (c), [cxq q0 ] = 0. Since this holds for all\n\u2032\nlarge q , it follows that [x] is a phantom element of Hi (F e (L.)).\n\u0003\nThe following is the main result of Section 2.\nProposition 2.3. Let R be a Noetherian ring of prime characteristic p > 0 which\ncontains a q0 -weak test element c, and let\n\u03b1.\n\n\u03b2.\n\n0 \u2192 L. \u2192 M. \u2192 N. \u2192 0\nbe a right-exact sequence of complexes of finitely generated R-modules, such that\nfor each degree i and every integer e \u2265 0, ker F e (\u03b1i ) \u2286 0\u2217F e (Li ) . (i.e. the sequence\nis both right exact and stably phantom exact)\nThen for any i \u2208 :\n\nZ\n\n(1) N. has stably phantom homology at i if and only if the following two conditions hold for all e \u2265 0:\n(a) Any element of Hi\u22121 (F e (L.)) which Hi\u22121 (F e (\u03b1.)) maps to a phantom\nelement of Hi\u22121 (F e (M.)) is itself a phantom element of Hi\u22121 (F e (L.)),\nand\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(b) For any [y] \u2208 Hi (F e (M.)) and any integer e\u2032 \u2265 e0 , [cy q ] \u2208 im Hi (F e+e )(\u03b1.).\n(2) If M. has stably phantom homology at i and L. has stably phantom homology\nat i \u2212 1, then N. has stably phantom homology at i.\nNote: Part (1) of the above Proposition is an analogue of the fact that in a five-term\nexact sequence, the middle term is zero if and only if the first map is surjective and\nthe last map is injective. Part (2) is an analogue of the fact that in a three-term\nexact sequence, if the outer two terms vanish, so does the middle term.\nAlso note that the result of applying the functor F e to the sequence given in the\nProposition preserves the hypotheses. For instance, the new sequence of complexes\nis right-exact because the old one was and F e is a right-exact functor.\nThese proofs arose as generalizations of proofs of their non-phantom analogues.\nProof (1).

Phantom depth, ghost depth, and lengths of phantom regular\nsequences\nIn this section I introduce Aberbach's phantom analogues from [Abe94] of depth,\nzerodivisors, and regular sequences. Then I give alternate characterizations (Propostion 4.4) of these concepts, and use these to give yet another characterization\n(Theorem 4.7) of phantom depth in terms of stable phantomness of Koszul homology. From this characterization, we get in Corollary 4.11 a positive answer to a\nquestion Aberbach asked in his paper.\nRecall [Abe94, 3.2.1-3.2.2]:\nDefinition 4.1. Let R be a Noetherian ring of characteristic p > 0 and M a finitely\ngenerated R-module. Then we say an element x \u2208 R is phantom M -regular (or a\nphantom nonzerodivisor of M ) if xM 6= M and 0 :F e (M) xt \u2286 0\u2217F e (M) for all e \u2265 0\nand all t \u2265 1.\nA phantom zerodivisor of M is an element of R which is not phantom M -regular.\n\n\fPHANTOM DEPTH AND STABLE PHANTOM EXACTNESS.\n\n9\n\nA sequence x = x1 , . . . , xn of elements of R is a phantom M -regular sequence if\nxM 6= M and if for all 0 \u2264 i < n, all i-tuples (u1 , . . . , ui ) of positive integers, and\nall integers t \u2265 1, xti+1 is phantom (M/(xu1 1 , . . . , xui i )M )-regular.\nRecall also that if p \u2208 Spec R and x = x1 , . . . , xn is a phantom M -regular\nsequence in p, then x1 /1, . . . , xn /1 is a phantom Mp regular sequence.\nThe following definition appears at first to be strictly weaker than Aberbach's\ndefinition. However, under very mild conditions on the ring (c.f. Proposition 4.4),\nthe two notions agree; I know of no instance where they disagree.\nDefinition 4.2. Let R be a Noetherian ring of characteristic p > 0 and M a finitely\ngenerated R-module. Then we say an element x \u2208 R is ghost M -regular if xM 6= M\nand 0 :F e (M) xq \u2286 0\u2217F e (M) for all e \u2265 0.\nA ghost zerodivisor of M is an element x \u2208 R which is not ghost M -regular.\nA sequence x = x1 , . . . , xn of elements of R is a ghost M -regular sequence if\nxM 6= M and xi+1 is ghost (M/(x1 , . . . , xi )M )-regular for 0 \u2264 i < n.\nNote that an element x \u2208 R with xM 6= M is ghost M -regular if and only if\nx\nthe sequence 0 \u2192 M \u2192 M is stably phantom exact. The analogy with M -regular\nelements is clear.\nThe first thing to note about ghost M -regular sequences is that those which sit\nin the maximal ideal of a local ring with a weak test element are permutable:\nProposition 4.3. Let (R, m) be a Noetherian local ring of characteristic p > 0\nwith a q0 -weak test element c, and let M be a finitely-generated R-module. Then\nfor any ghost M -regular sequence x contained in m, any permutation of x is also a\nghost M -regular sequence.\nProof. It is clear from the definition that for any 1 \u2264 i < n, x1 , . . . , xn is a ghost\nM -regular sequence if and only if x1 , . . . , xi is a ghost M -regular sequence and\nxi+1 , . . . , xn is a ghost (M/(x1 , . . . , xi )M )-regular sequence. Hence, since any permutation is a composition of transpositions of adjacent elements, it suffices to show\nthe result for ghost M -regular sequences of length two. That is, we assume that x, y\nis a ghost M -regular sequence, and we need to show that y, x is a ghost M -regular\nsequence.\nFirst we show that x is ghost (M/yM )-regular: Let e \u2265 0, and let z\u0304 \u2208 F e (M/yM ) =\ne\nF (M )/y q F e (M ) such that xq z\u0304 = 0\u0304. That is, z \u2208 F e (M ), and\nxq z = y q w\n\n(5)\n\nfor some w \u2208 F e (M ).

Let e \u2265 0 and z \u2208 F e (M ) such\nthat y q z = 0. Then y q z \u2208 xq F e (M ), so that by ghost (M/xM )-regularity of y,\n\u2032\n\u2217\nz \u2208 (xq F e (M ))F e (M) .

Let (R, m) be a Noetherian local ring of characteristic p > 0\nwhich contains a q0 -weak test element c, let M be a finitely generated R-module,\nand let x = x1 , . . . , xn be a sequence of elements of m. Then the following are\nequivalent:\n(a) M 6= xM , and for all 0 \u2264 i < n, all (i + 1)-tuples (t1 , . . . , ti+1 ) of positive\nintegers, and all integers e \u2265 0,\n(7)\n\nt\n\ni+1\n\u2286 0\u2217F e (M)/(xt1 ,...,xti )F e (M) .\n0 :F e (M)/(xt1 ,...,xti )F e (M) xi+1\n1\n\ni\n\n1\n\ni\n\n(b) x is a phantom M -regular sequence.\n(c) x is a ghost M -regular sequence.\n(d) M 6= xM , and for all 0 \u2264 i < n and all e \u2265 0, xqi+1 is Ge (M/(x1 , . . . , xi )M )regular.\n(e) M 6= xM , and for all 0 \u2264 i < n and all e \u226b 0, xqi+1 is Ge (M/(x1 , . . . , xi )M )regular.\nProof. We will show that (a) \u21d2 (b) \u21d2 (c) \u21d2 (d) \u21d2 (e) \u21d2 (c) \u21d2 (a).\nIt is easy to see that (a) \u21d2 (b) \u21d2 (c). For suppose x satisfies (a). Then for any\ni-tuple (u1 , . . . , ui ) of positive integers, and any integers e \u2265 0 and t \u2265 1, we have:\n0 :F e (M/(xu1 1 ,...,xui )M) xti+1 = 0 :F e (M)/(xu1 1 q ,...,xui q )F e (M) xti+1\ni\n\ni\n\n\u2286 0\u2217F e (M)/(xu1 q ,...,xui q )F e (M)\n1\n\ni\n\n= 0\u2217F e (M/(xu1 ,...,xui )M) .\n1\n\ni\n\nThe containment follows from setting tj = uj q for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 i and ti+1 = t in (7)\nabove. To see that (b) \u21d2 (c), for each i and e, simply set uj = 1 for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 i and\n\n\fPHANTOM DEPTH AND STABLE PHANTOM EXACTNESS.\n\n11\n\nt = pe in the definition of phantom M -regularity to obtain the defining containment\nfor ghost M -regularity.\nTo see that (c) \u21d2 (d), it suffices to show that if an element x is ghost M -regular,\nthen xq is Ge (M )-regular for all e. So fix e and let z \u2208 F e (M ) such that xq z\u0304 = 0\u0304\n\u2032\n\u2032\nin Ge (M ). That is, xq z \u2208 0\u2217F e (M) . Then for all q \u2032 \u226b 0, cxqq z q = 0, so that by\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nghost M -regularity of x, cz q \u2208 0\u2217F e+e\u2032 (M) , whence c1 z q q0 = 0 for all such q \u2032 , and\nhence z \u2208 0\u2217F e (M) , i.e., z\u0304 = 0\u0304. So xq is Ge (M )-regular for all e.\nThe implication (d) \u21d2 (e) is trivial.\nTo show (e) \u21d2 (c), it suffices to show that if an element x has the property\nthat xq is Ge (M )-regular for e \u226b 0, then x is ghost M -regular. So fix e and let\n\u2032\n\u2032\nz \u2208 F e (M ) such that xq z = 0. Then for all q \u2032 , xqq z q = 0, and for sufficiently large\n\u2032\n\u2032\nq \u2032 the hypothesis then shows that z q \u2208 0\u2217F e+e\u2032 (M) , and therefore cz q q0 = 0 for all\nsuch q \u2032 . Hence, z \u2208 0\u2217F e (M) , which completes the proof that x is ghost M -regular.\nIt remains to show that (c) \u21d2 (a). Accordingly, we assume x is a ghost M -regular\nsequence.\nIf e \u2265 0, n \u2265 1, and t1 , . . . , tn \u2265 1 are integers, then by the division algorithm,\nwe have t1 = dq + r, where 1 \u2264 r \u2264 q. We assume by induction on n that for any\nM , any ghost M -regular sequence of length n\u2212 1 satisfies (a), and then we prove by\ninduction on d that for any e and any n-tuple t1 , . . . , tn of positive integers where\nt1 = dq + r, where 1 \u2264 r \u2264 q, (7) holds.\nFirst take the case where n = 1 and d = 0.1 That is, xt11 z = 0, where t1 \u2264 q\nand z \u2208 F e (M ). Then xq1 z = x1q\u2212t1 xt11 z = 0, so that by ghost M -regularity of x1 ,\nz \u2208 0\u2217F e (M) . If d > 0, then t1 > q, and xt11 \u2212q xq1 z = xt11 z = 0, so that by induction\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nqq q\nq\non d, xq1 z \u2208 0\u2217F e (M) . Then for any e\u2032 \u2265 e0 , xqq\n= c(xq1 z)q = 0 in\n1 (cz ) = cx1 z\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nF e+e (M ).

Hence, c1 z q q0 =\n\u2032\n\nc(cz q )q0 = 0, and since this holds for all e\u2032 \u2265 e0 , it follows that z \u2208 0\u2217F e (M) .\nNow consider the case where n > 1.

Let R be a Noetherian ring of characteristic p > 0.

It may well be that every finitely generated module\nover any such R satisfies avoidance. Certainly it is known when the ring itself\nsatisfies countable prime avoidance 2 , which is the case if the ring is complete [Bur72,\nLemma 3] or if it contains an uncountable field [HH00, Remark 2.17, for instance].\nThe set \u222ae\u22650 AssR GeR (N ) has a tendency to be finite, and if all quotients of M\nhave the property that the corresponding union for the quotient is finite, then the\nusual prime avoidance property yields that M satisfies avoidance. However, Singh\nand Swanson [SS04] have given an example of a Noetherian normal ring R where\nevery ideal is tightly closed, along with an ideal in that ring where the union of the\nprimes associated to all the Frobenius powers (hence also all the tight closures of\nthe Frobenius powers) of the ideal is not a finite set. Hence, we cannot rely on the\nunion to be actually finite.\nThe following is the main theorem of this section, and will be proved after\nLemma 4.10. The corollary following its proof answers in the affirmative, at least\nfor modules satisfying avoidance, the question raised in [Abe94]: All phantom M regular sequences in an ideal I have the same length.\n2Countable prime avoidance is the condition that any ideal which is contained in countable\nunion of primes must be contained in one of the primes.\n\n\f14\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN\n\nTheorem 4.7. 3 Let R be a Noetherian local ring of characteristic p > 0 which\ncontains a weak test element c, and let M be a finitely generated R-module.

[Epsa, essentially Lemma 1.1] Let R be a Noetherian local ring of\ncharacteristic p > 0 and M a finitely\nR-module. Then the set of phantom\nS Sgenerated\ne\nzerodivisors for M is contained in\ne Ass G (M ). If R has a q0 -weak test element\nc, then every element of this union is a phantom zerodivisor for M .\nProof. For the first part, let x be a phantom zerodivisor for M . Then there is\nsome e \u2265 0 and t > 0 such that 0 :F e (M) xt 6\u2286 0\u2217F e (M) . That is, there is some\nz \u2208 F e (M ) \\ 0\u2217F e (M) with xt z = 0. Then xt z = 0 in Ge (M ), where z 6= 0\u0304, so there\nis some p \u2208 Ass Ge (M ) with xt \u2208 p. Since p is prime and thus radical, x \u2208 p.\nFor the second part, let x \u2208 p for some p \u2208 Ass Ge (M ) for some e. Then\nthere is some z \u2208 F e (M ), z 6\u2208 0\u2217F e (M) , with p = 0 :Ge (M) z, which means that\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nxz \u2208 0\u2217F e (M) . Then for all large powers q \u2032 \u226b 0 of p, cxq z q = 0. If x is phantom M \u2032\n\nregular, this together with the last equation implies that cz q \u2208 0\u2217F e+e\u2032 (M) . Hence,\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nc1 z q q0 = c(cz q )q0 = 0, from which we conclude that z \u2208 0\u2217F e (M) , contrary to\nassumption. Thus, x is a phantom zerodivisor for M .\n\u0003\nNext, we prove the case d = 1 of Theorem 4.7:\nLemma 4.9. Let R be a Noetherian local ring of characteristic p > 0 containing a\nq0 -weak test element c. Let M be a finitely generated R-module and x a sequence\nin m of length n. Consider the following conditions\n(a) The ideal (x) contains a phantom M -regular element.\n(b) K. (x; M ) has stably phantom homology at n.\nThen (a) \u21d2 (b), and if M satisfies avoidance then (b) \u21d2 (a) as well.\nProof. Note that an element of Hn (x[q] ; F e (M )) is precisely an element of F e (M )\nwhich is killed by each xqi ; i = 1, . . . , n, and we have that Bn (x[q] ; F e (M )) = 0.\nBy Proposition 2.2(b), we need to show that the existence of a phantom M -regular\nelement in (x) implies (and if M satisfies avoidance, is equivalent to) the assertion\nthat for any e \u2265 0, any element of F e (M ) which is killed by all of the xqi is an\nelement of 0\u2217F e (M) .\nFirst suppose that we have a phantom M -regular element y \u2208 (x). Take any\nnonnegative integer e, and let z \u2208 F e (M ) be an element annihilated by all of the\nxqi . Then since y q is a linear combination of the xqi , y q z = 0, so by definition of\nphantom (or ghost) M -regularity, z \u2208 0\u2217F e (M) . Hence K.(x; M ) has stably phantom\nhomology at n.\n3See also Corollary 5.3.\n\n\fPHANTOM DEPTH AND STABLE PHANTOM EXACTNESS.\n\n15\n\nFor the other direction, assume that M satisfies avoidance and that (x) has\nno phantom M -regular elements. By Lemma 4.8 and avoidance, there is some e\nand some z \u2208 F e (M ) \\ 0\u2217F e (M) such that p = 0\u2217F e (M) :F e (M) z is a prime ideal\ncontaining (x). Then for each i = 1, . . . , n, xi z \u2208 0\u2217F e (M) , so xqi z \u2208 0\u2217F e (M) , and\n\u2032\n\nq q\nq\nthus xqq\n= 0, for all e\u2032 \u2265 e0 and all i. If K.(x; M ) had stably\ni (cz ) = c(xi z)\n\u2032\n\u2032\nphantom homology at n, then since cz q is killed by all the xqq\ni , we would have\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\ncz q \u2208 0\u2217F e+e\u2032 (M) , hence c1 z q q0 = c(cz q )q0 = 0, for all e\u2032 . Thus, z \u2208 0\u2217F e (M) , which\nis a contradiction. Hence, K.(x; M ) does not have stably phantom homology at\nn.\n\u0003\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nThe final preparatory lemma provides the inductive step in Theorem 4.7. In\npreparation, note the easy fact that\ne\nF e (K.(x; M )) \u223c\n= K.(x[p ] ; F e (M ))\n\nas complexes of R-modules, for any e.\nLemma 4.10. Let R be a Noetherian local ring of characteristic p > 0 containing\na q0 -weak test element c, and let M be a finitely generated R-module. Let y1 , . . . , yu\nbe a phantom M -regular sequence in (x), where u \u2265 1 and x = x1 , . . . , xn . Then\nthe following are equivalent:\n(a) K.(x; M ) has stably phantom homology at n \u2212 i for i = 0, 1, . . . , u.\n(b) K.(x; M/y1 M ) has stably phantom homology at n\u2212 j for j = 0, 1, . . . , u \u2212 1.\n(c) K.(x; M/(y1 , . . . , yu )M ) has stably phantom homology at n.\nProof. For parts (a) and (b), note that the following sequence of complexes:\n\u03b1.\n\n\u03b2.\n\n0 \u2192 K.(x; M ) \u2192 K.(x; M ) \u2192 K.(x; M/y1 M ) \u2192 0\nsatisfies the conditions of Proposition 2.3, where for each i, \u03b1i is multiplication\nby y1 and \u03b2i is the canonical surjection associated to \u03b1i , since ker(y1q : F e (M ) \u2192\nF e (M )) \u2286 0\u2217F e (M) for all e \u2265 0. Also note that for this \u03b1., we have Hi (F e (\u03b1.)) = 0\nfor all i and all e \u2265 0, since y1q \u2208 (x[q] ) for all q. (see [BH97, Proposition 1.6.5])\nSuppose that (a) holds. Then for j = 0, . . . , u \u2212 1, K.(x; M ) has stably phantom\nhomology at n \u2212 j and n \u2212 (j + 1) = (n \u2212 j) \u2212 1, so that by Proposition 2.3(2),\nK.(x; M/y1 M ) has stably phantom homology at n \u2212 j.\nConversely, suppose that (b) holds. First take i \u2208 {0, . . . , u \u2212 1}, and [z] \u2208\n\u2032\n\u2032\nHn\u2212i (x[q] ; F e (M )). Then by Proposition 2.3(1b), [cz q ] \u2208 im Hn\u2212i (F e+e (\u03b1.)) =\n0 for all e\u2032 \u2265 e0 , since K.(x; M/y1 M ) has stably phantom homology at n \u2212 i.\nHence [z] is a phantom element of Hn\u2212i (x[q] ; F e (M )). On the other hand, take\n[w] \u2208 Hn\u2212u (x[q] ; F e (M )). Then since [\u03b1n\u2212u (w)] = 0 and K.(x; M/y1 M ) has stably\nphantom homology at n \u2212 u + 1, it follows from Proposition 2.3(1a), that [w] is a\nphantom element of Hn\u2212u (x[q] ; F e (M )). Hence, (a) holds.\nFinally, we prove that (b) \u21d4 (c): If u = 1, then the two expressions are identical. If u > 1, then since y2 , . . . , yu is a phantom (M/y1 M )-regular sequence,\nthe equivalence follows by induction on u and the fact that parts (a) and (b) are\nequivalent.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 4.7. We proceed by induction on d. The case d = 1 is Lemma 4.9,\nso we may assume that d \u2265 2 and that we've proved the theorem for smaller d.\n\n\f16\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN\n\nFirst suppose that (x) contains a phantom M -regular sequence y1 , . . . , yd . Then\nyd is phantom (M/(y1 , . . . , yd\u22121 )M )-regular, so by Lemma 4.9, K.(x; M/(y1 , . . . , yd\u22121 )M )\nhas stably phantom homology at n, whence by Lemma 4.10, K.(x; M ) has stably\nphantom homology at n \u2212 i for all i = 0, 1, . . . , d \u2212 1.\nFor the converse, suppose that K.(x; M ) has stably phantom homology at n \u2212 i\nfor i = 0, 1, . . . , d \u2212 1, and that M satisfies avoidance. By induction on d, there\nis a phantom M -regular sequence y1 , . . . , yd\u22121 in (x). Therefore, by Lemma 4.10,\nK.(x; M/(y1 , . . . , yd\u22121 )M ) has stably phantom homology at n, and then we use\nLemma 4.9 to guarantee the existence of a phantom (M/(y1 , . . . , yd\u22121 )M )-regular\nelement yd , giving the desired phantom M -regular sequence y1 , . . . , yd in (x). \u0003\nCorollary 4.11. Let R be a Noetherian local ring of characteristic p > 0 which contains a weak test element c, let M be a finitely generated R-module with avoidance,\nand let I be a proper ideal of R. Then all maximal phantom M -regular sequences\nin I have the same length: ph.depthI M .\nProof. Let y = y1 , . . . , yt , be a maximal phantom M -regular sequence in I, and let\nd = ph.depthI M . Let x = x1 , . . . , xn be a generating set for I. By Lemma 4.9,\nsince I does not contain any phantom (M/yM )-regular elements, K.(x; M/yM )\ndoes not have stably phantom homology at n. Then by Lemma 4.10, there is some\ni \u2208 {0, . . . , t} such that K.(x; M ) does not have stably phantom homology at n \u2212 i.\nOn the other hand, by Theorem 4.7, since I contains a phantom M -regular sequence\nof length d, K.(x; M ) has stably phantom homology at n \u2212 j for j = 0, . . . , d \u2212 1.\nHence, t \u2265 i \u2265 d, but we also know that d \u2265 t by definition of phantom depth, so\nd = t. Thus, all maximal phantom M -regular sequences in I have length d.\n\u0003\n5. Stable phantom rigidity of Koszul complexes and ghost\nM -regular sequences\nIn this section we show (Theorem 5.2) that over a prime characteristic Noetherian\nlocal ring with a weak test element, any Koszul complex is \"stably phantom rigid.\"\nAccording to Auslander [Aus61], a complex K. is called rigid if whenever L is\nfinitely generated and i > 0 an integer such that Tori (K., L) = 0, it follows that\nTorj (K., L) = 0 for all j > i. A module is called rigid if its minimal free resolution\nis a rigid complex.\nIn [AB58], Auslander and Buchsbaum showed that the Koszul complex on any\nfinite set of elements of a ring is rigid. Auslander then used this along with Serre's\ndiagonalization argument to show [Aus61, Theorem 2.1] that any finitely generated\nmodule over an equicharacteristic or unramified regular local ring is rigid. Lichtenbaum [Lic66] showed the same result for ramified regular local rings. If we pass to\nnon-regular local rings, examples of non-rigid modules of infinite projective dimension are easily constructed. However, Auslander's question in [Aus61], of whether\nmodules of finite projective dimension over a Noetherian local ring are always rigid,\nwas open for over 30 years. As Hochster noted in [Hoc75, Chapter 2], if it were\ntrue, it would yield several interesting results which were at that time conjectures.\nSince then, these consequences of rigidity were shown to be true, but Heitmann\nshowed Auslander's \"rigidity conjecture\" is false.[Hei93] The ring in Heitmann's\ncounterexample is not a complete intersection, and indeed the rigidity conjecture is\nopen for complete intersections. For work on rigidity over complete intersections,\nsee [Mur63], [HW94], [HW97], [Jor99], and [HJW01].\n\n\fPHANTOM DEPTH AND STABLE PHANTOM EXACTNESS.\n\n17\n\nIn this section, we provide an analogue in Theorem 5.2, in terms of stable phantomness of homology, of Auslander and Buchsbaum's result on rigidity of the Koszul\ncomplex.\nThe same method is used to obtain a Koszul homology criterion for a sequence\nof elements to be a ghost M -regular sequence (Theorem 5.4). Aberbach also gives\na Koszul homology criterion for a sequence to be phantom M -regular in [Abe94,\nTheorem 3.3.8], so by Proposition 4.4, we already have a Koszul homology criterion\nfor a sequence to be ghost M -regular. However, the criterion given here seems easier\nto check, and in any case the stable phantom rigidity result is interesting in its own\nright. First note the following\nLemma 5.1. Let (R, m) be a Noetherian local ring of characteristic p > 0 containing a q0 -weak test element c. Let x = x1 , . . . , xn be a sequence of elements of m,\nwhere n \u2265 1, and let x\u2032 = x1 , . . . , xn\u22121 . Then for any i > 0, if K.(x; M ) has stably\nphantom homology at i, so does K.(x\u2032 ; M ).\nProof. Let [y] \u2208 Hi (x\u2032[q] ; F e (M )) for some fixed e \u2265 0. Recall (e.g. [BH97, Corollary 1.6.13(a)]) that we have an exact sequence:\n(12)\n\n\u00b1xq\n\nge\n\nHi (x\u2032[q] ; F e (M )) \u2192n Hi (x\u2032[q] ; F e (M )) \u2192 Hi (x[q] ; F e (M )).\n\u2032\n\nThen ge ([y]) \u2208 Hi (x[q] ; F e (M )) is, of course, phantom, so that ge+e\u2032 ([cy q ]) is\n[0] for any e\u2032 \u2265 e0 . Fix some such e\u2032 . Then by exactness of (12) for e + e\u2032 ,\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032[qq\u2032 ]\n; F e+e (M )). That is, there exist v \u2208\n[cy q ] = xqq\nn [w] for some [w] \u2208 Hi (x\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nKi+1 (x\u2032[qq ] ; F e+e (M )) and w \u2208 Ki (x\u2032[qq ] ; F e+e (M )) such that \u2202(w) = 0 and\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ncy q = \u2202(v) + xqq\nn w.\nSince y \u2208 Zi (x\u2032[q] ; F e (M )) was arbitrarily chosen and since x \u2208 m, we have that\n[q\u2032 ]\n\n(13) cZi (x\u2032[q] ; F e (M ))Ki (x\u2032[q] ;F e (M))\n[q\u2032 ]\n\n\u2286 Bi (x\u2032[q] ; F e (M ))Ki (x\u2032[q] ;F e (M))\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n+ m[qq ] Zi (x\u2032[qq ] ; F e+e (M )).\nSince (13) holds for all e and all e\u2032 \u2265 0, Proposition 3.1 implies that Zi (x\u2032[q] ; F e (M )) \u2286\nBi (x\u2032[q] ; F e (M ))\u2217Ki (x\u2032[q] ;F e (M)) for all e \u2265 0. That is, K.(x; M ) has stably phantom\nhomology at i.\n\u0003\nTheorem 5.2 (Stable phantom rigidity of Koszul complexes).

If M = R we call it the minheight of I and denote it by mnht I. The\nfollowing Proposition connects minheight with phantom depth.\nProposition 6.1. Let (R, m) be a Noetherian local ring of characteristic p > 0,\nand J any proper ideal of R.\n(a) If R satisfies colon capturing (which holds, e.g., if R is either a quotient\nof a Cohen-Macaulay local ring [Hun96, Theorem 3.1] or a module-finite\nextension of a regular local ring [Hun96, Theorem 3.1A]), then mnht J \u2264\nph.depthJ R.\n\n\f20\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN\n\n(b) If R has a locally stable weak test element c and M is a finitely generated\nR-module such that for every p \u2208 Spec R, Mp is faithful as an Rp -module,\nthen mnhtJ M \u2265 ph.depthJ M .\nThe hypotheses of (b) hold when R has a locally stable weak test element and we\ntake M = R, so in this case, mnht J \u2265 ph.depthJ R. If, moreover, R satisfies colon\ncapturing, then mnht J = ph.depthJ R, as Aberbach notes in the proof of [Abe94,\nTheorem 3.2.7].\nWe need to prove the following Lemma:\nLemma 6.2. Let (R, m) be a Noetherian local ring of characteristic p > 0 with a\nq0 -weak test element c, and let M be a finitely generated faithful R-module. Suppose\nthat y1 , . . . , yd is a phantom M -regular sequence in m, and q is a minimal prime of\nM . Then m is not minimal over q + (y1 , . . . , yd\u22121 ).\nProof. Since M is a faithful R-module, q is a minimal prime of R. Then qRq is a\nnilpotent ideal in Rq , so there exists some a \u2208\n/ q and some positive integer t such\nthat for all q \u2265 t, aqq = 0.\nAssume that m is minimal over q + (y1 , . . . , yd\u22121 ). Then for some power q \u2032 of p,\nq\u2032\nm \u2286 q + (y1 , . . . , yd\u22121 ). Hence, for any e so large that q = pe \u2265 t,\n\u2032\n\nq\naydqq \u2208 am[qq ] \u2286 (y1q , . . . , yd\u22121\n).\n\u2032\n\nThen for any z \u2208 F e (M ),\n\u2032\n\n[q]\n\naydqq z \u2208 (y1 , . . . , yd\u22121 )[q] F e (M ) = ((y1 , . . . , yd\u22121 )M )M .\nBut since y1 , . . . , yd is a phantom M -regular sequence, it follows that\n\u0010\n\u0011\u2217\naz \u2208 (y1 , . . . , yd\u22121 )M )[q] e\n.\nF (M)\n\nHence, by the weak test element hypothesis,\n\n[qq ]\n\nc(az)q0 = caq0 z q0 \u2208 ((y1 , . . . , yd\u22121 )M )M 0 ,\nso that since z was an arbitrary element of F e (M ) and since F e+e0 (M ) is generated\nas an R-module by all the q0 'th \"powers\" of such elements, it follows that\n[qq ]\n\ncaq0 \u2208 ((y1 , . . . , yd\u22121 )M )M 0 :R F e+e0 (M ) = 0 :R F e+e0 (M/(y1 , . . . , yd\u22121 )M ).\nSince e can be taken to be arbitrarily large, and since 0 :R F e (N ) \u2286 m[q] for\nany finitely generated R-module N , and any e \u2265 0,4 it now follows from the Krull\n/ q and a \u2208\n/ q, which contradicts\nintersection theorem that caq0 = 0 \u2208 q. However, c \u2208\nof the fact that q is prime.\n\u0003\n4Here is a proof of that fact. Let\n\u03c6\n\nRt \u2192 Rs \u2192 N \u2192 0\nbe a minimal free presentation of N . Then if we fix bases of Rt and Rs , all the entries of the\nmatrix representing \u03c6 are in m. Moreover, \u03c6[q] is a minimal free presentation of F e (N ), and all\nits entries lie in m[q] . Now take any a \u2208 0 :R F e (N ). Then by exactness of the presentation, for\nthe first basis element (or any other basis element) e1 of Rs ,\n[q]\n\nae1 \u2208 im \u03c6[q] \u2286 m[q] Rs .\nHence, a \u2208 m[q] .\n\n\fPHANTOM DEPTH AND STABLE PHANTOM EXACTNESS.\n\n21\n\nProof of Proposition 6.1. For part (a), let n = mnht J. Then J contains a sequence\nx1 , . . . , xn of elements of R such that for all i = 1, . . . , n, mnht (x1 , . . . , xi ) = i. Fix\nsome integer i with 0 \u2264 i < n, and some sequence t1 , . . . , ti+1 \u2208 + . Suppose y \u2208 R\nti+1\ny \u2208 (xt11 , . . . , xtii ). Then by colon capturing, y \u2208 (xt11 , . . . , xtii )\u2217 .\nsuch that xi+1\nHence, x1 , . . . , xn is a phantom R-regular sequence, so ph.depthJ R \u2265 n = mnht J.\nFor part (b), let q be a minimal prime of M , let y1 , . . . , yd be a phantom R-regular\nsequence, where d = ph.depthJ M , and for some 0 \u2264 i < n let p be a minimal prime\nof q + (y1 , . . . , yi ). Then if yi+1 \u2208 p, we have that y1 /1, . . . , yi+1 /1 is a phantom\nMp -sequence, that qRp is a minimal prime of Mp , that Mp is a faithful Rp -module,\nand that pRp is a minimal prime of qRp +(y1 /1, . . . , yi /1). This set of circumstances\ncontradicts Lemma 6.2, so we conclude that yi+1 \u2208\n/ p. It follows from the criterion\nfor minheight in [HH93, Proposition 2.2(c)] that ph.depthJ M = d \u2264 mnhtJ M . \u0003\n\nN\n\nThus, when R has a weak test element and Mp is a faithful Rp -module for all p,\nwe have the following string of inequalities:\ndepthJ M \u2264 ph.depthJ M \u2264 mnhtJ M \u2264 htJ M,\nand if M = R, the middle inequality is always an equality. In particular, if J = m,\nwe have:\ndepth M \u2264 ph.depth M \u2264 mnhtm M \u2264 dim M.\n7. Phantom assassinators, stable primes, and the associated primes\nof reduced Frobenius powers\nThere are three analogues of associated primes of a finitely generated R-module\nM that I know of in tight closure theory. The first is the set\n[\nAss GeR (M ),\ne\u22650\n\nwhich we have already seen at work many times in this paper. The second is the\nphantom assassinator Ass Ph M . The latter notion is explored in [AHH93], but\nthere it is only defined for modules of finite phantom projective dimension, and\nis defined to consist of all primes p such that ppdRp Mp = mnht pRp . However, I\nsee no reason to restrict this notion to the case of finite ppd, and so I propose the\nfollowing definition, which is equivalent to the one given in [AHH93] under mild\nconditions on R5 when ppdR M < \u221e:\nAss Ph M := {p \u2208 Spec R | ph.depthpRp Mp = 0}.\nThe third analogue is a slight generalization of a construction given in [HH00].6 If\nN is a submodule of M and z \u2208 M , then q \u2208 Spec R is a stable prime associated\n5In particular, they are equivalent whenever Aberbach's phantom Auslander-Buchsbaum Theorem [Abe94, Theorem 3.2.7] holds, which in turn is true over nearly all rings of interest: see\n[AHH93, Proposition 5.4 and Discussion 5.5]. There such rings are said to have acceptable type.\n6Hochster and Huneke defined the invariants T and T (x) for ideals I \u2286 R and x \u2208 R. Their\nI\nI\nnotions are in fact a special case of what I define in this section. In my notation, one would write\nTIR and TIR (x), considering I to be a submodule of R. However, all of the results in [HH00] for\nM and T M (x) respectively. It may be puzzling at\nTI and TI (x) go through without change for TN\nN\nfirst what to do with the hypothesis that R is reduced. However, in all cases one can eliminate it,\nsometimes with slight changes in the statements. For example, one must replace \"square locally\nstable test element\" everywhere with \"(q0 + 1)-power of a locally stable q0 -weak test element,\"\nand in Proposition 3.3(d)-(g), we must constrain q to be \u2265 q0 . I encourage the reader to read\nsection 3 of [HH00] with these facts in mind.\n\n\f22\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN\n\nto N \u2286 M and z if z \u2208\n/ (Nq )\u2217Mq and for all primes p ( q, z \u2208 (Np )\u2217Mp . We write\nS\nq \u2208 TNM (z) in this case. Set TNM := z\u2208M TNM (z), the stable primes associated to\nN \u2286 M . Then our final tight closure theoretic notion of associated primes of M is\nT M := T0M ,\n\nthe set of stable primes associated to 0 \u2286 M .\nHow do we compare these three notions? First, we have the following\nProposition 7.1.\u0011 If R has a locally stable q0 -weak test element c, then T M \u2286\n\u0010\nS\ne\nPh\nM.\ne\u22650 Ass GR (M ) \u2229 Ass\n\nProof. Let q \u2208 T M . Then q \u2208 T0M (z) for some z \u2208 M . In particular, q is\n\u2032\n\u2032\nminimal over the ideal 0\u2217F e\u2032 (M) : cz q for all e\u2032 \u226b 0. Hence, q \u2208 Ass GeR (M ) \u2286\nS\ne\ne\u22650 Ass GR (M ).\nNow, suppose that cz q \u2208 0\u2217F e (Mq ) for all q \u226b 0. Then cq0 +1 z qq0 = 0 for all q \u226b 0,\nfrom which it follows that z \u2208 0\u2217Mq , contradicting the definition of T0M (z). Hence,\nthere are infinitely many powers q of p for which cz q \u2208\n/ 0\u2217F e (Mq ) . For all such q,\nthen, 0\u2217F e (Mq ) : cz q \u2286 qRq . On the other hand, for any p ( q, z \u2208 0\u2217Mp , so cz q = 0\nin Mp = (Mq )pRq for all q \u2265 q0 . For these choices of q, then, pRq + 0\u2217F e (Mq ) : cz q ,\nso qRq is minimal over 0\u2217F e (Mq ) : cz q . Therefore, qRq \u2208 AssRq GeRq (Mq ), which\n\u0003\nproves that ph.depthRq Mq = 0, i.e. q \u2208 Ass Ph M .\nFor further comparisons, we examine the notion of phantom assassinator more\nclosely:\nPhantom assassinators. Many properties of phantom assassinators were derived\nand used in [AHH93], although as mentioned before, it was assumed that the modules investigated had finite phantom projective dimension. It is natural to ask\nwhich of their results still hold in our more general case involving modules of possibly infinite phantom projective dimension:\nFirst of all, the equivalence of (a): (that ph.depthm M = 0) and (c): (that\nm \u2208 \u222ae Ass Ge (M )) for a finitely generated module M over a local ring (R, m) in\nProposition 5.9 of that paper has already been shown here in Lemma 4.8, assuming\nthat R has a weak test element. Part (b) (that ppdR M = mnht m) is of course\nfalse in the case of infinite phantom projective dimension, since the minheight of\nan ideal in a Noetherian ring is always finite, bounded as it is by the height, hence\nby the size of a generating set of the ideal\nNext we investigate [AHH93, Theorem 5.11]. The given proof of part (a) involves\nphantom resolutions, but in fact the first two statements of (a) can be proved\nwithout them, as we shall show by using the following easy\nLemma 7.2. [Epsa, Lemma 1.3] Let (R, m) be a Noetherian local ring of characteristic p > 0 and M a finitely generated R-module. Then for any e \u2265 0,\nAss Ge (M ) \u2286 Ass Ge+1 (M ).\nLemma 7.3 (Most of [AHH93, Theorem 5.11(a)], without assuming finite ppd or\nacceptable type). Let M be a finitely generated R-module, where R is a Noetherian\nlocal ring of characteristic p > 0 containing a locally stable weak test element. Every\nminimal prime of M is in Ass Ph M . For all e \u2208 , Ass Ph F e (M ) = Ass Ph M .\n\nN\n\n\fPHANTOM DEPTH AND STABLE PHANTOM EXACTNESS.\n\n23\n\nProof. For the first statement, first assume that m is itself a minimal prime of M .\nThen for some positive integer t, mt M = 0. Take any z \u2208 M \\ 0\u2217M . Then mt z = 0,\nso mt \u2286 0\u2217M : z \u2286 m. The set in the middle is the annihilator of z\u0304 in G0 (M ), so it\nmust be contained in some associated prime of G0 (M ). But the only prime ideal\ncontaining mt is m. Hence m \u2208 Ass G0 (M ). By Lemma 4.8, then, m consists of\nphantom zerodivisors of M , so that ph.depthm M = 0, i.e. m \u2208 Ass Ph M .\nNow take the general case where p is a minimal prime of M . Then pRp is a\nminimal prime of Mp , and so ph.depthpRp Mp = 0, which is the same as saying that\np \u2208 Ass Ph M .\nFor the second statement, note that for any e, Lemma 7.2 implies that\n[\n[\n\u2032\n\u2032\nAssRp Ge (Mp ) =\nAssRp Ge (Mp ).\ne\u2032 \u22650\n\n\u2032\n\ne\u2032 \u2265e\n\n\u2032\n\nMoreover, Ge (F e (Mp )) = Ge+e (Mp ) for any e, e\u2032 \u2265 0, so by Lemma 4.8, the union\nof the left hand side of the equation above consists of the phantom zerodivisors of\nMp , whereas the union of the right hand side consists of the phantom zerodivisors\nof F e (Mp ). Thus, Mp has phantom depth 0 if and only if F e (Mp ) = (F e (M ))p has\nphantom depth 0, which shows that Ass Ph M = Ass Ph F e (M ) for any e \u2265 0.\n\u0003\nPart (b) of [AHH93, Theorem 5.11] states that if M has finite phantom projective\ndimension, then Ass Ph M is a finite set. In particular, every element of Ass Ph M is\na minimal prime of some ideal of the form Ii + pj , where Ii = Iri (G.) for a given\nfinite phantom resolution G. of M and pj is a minimal prime of R. In general,\nthere will at least be non-local cases where Ass Ph M is an infinite set (see below),\nso I doubt that [AHH93, Theorem 5.11(b)] has any analogue at all in the case of\ninfinite ppd.\nNow consider [AHH93, Theorems 5.13-5.14]. The only results used in the proofs\nare ones which go through without assuming M to have finite ppd, as the reader\nmay check. So we state the results here (with the second one in slightly different\nform, for the sake of simplicity):\nProposition 7.4 ([AHH93, Theorem 5.13], without assuming finite ppd or acceptable type). Let R be a Noetherian local ring of characteristic p possessing a locally\nstable weak test element,\nS and let M be a finitely generated R-module. Then every\nmaximal element of e\u2208N Ass Ge (M ) is in the phantom assassinator of M .\nS\nBy the Singh-Swanson example mentioned in note 4.6, e\u2208N Ass Ge (M ) may\nhave infinitely many maximal elements, even for very nice rings R. Singh and\nSwanson's ring is not local, but if we could make it local, we would have an example\nof a finitely generated M over an otherwise well-behaved local ring where Ass Ph M\nwas an infinite set.\nDefinition 7.5 (See [AHH93, 5.8]). We say that M is phantom unmixed if every\nprime in Ass Ph M is a minimal prime of M .\nProposition 7.6 ([AHH93, Theorem 5.14], without assuming finite ppd or acceptable type). Let R be a Noetherian local ring of characteristic p > 0 possessing a\nlocally stable weak test element, and let M be a finitely generated R-module. Then\nM is phantom unmixed if and only if Ge (M ) is unmixed for all e \u2265 0.\nHence (because of [AHH93, Theorem 3.7]), if M is phantom unmixed then tight\nclosure commutes with localization for the pair 0 \u2286 M .\n\n\f24\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN\n\nThis last result is not new. As Craig Huneke pointed out to me, it is a consequence of the following theorem:\nTheorem 7.7. ([HH00, Theorem 3.5], in terms of modules) Let R be a Noetherian\nlocal ring, let c be the (q0 + 1)'th power of a locally stable q0 -weak test element, and\nlet M be a finitely generated R-module. The following are equivalent:\n(1) Tight closure commutes with localization for the pair 0 \u2286 M .\n(2) (a) T M is finite and\n(b) For every z \u2208 M and q \u2208 T M (z), there exists an\n\u0010 integer N ,\u0011possibly\nNq\ndepending on q, such that for all q \u226b 0, q \u2286 0\u2217F e (M) : cz q .\nq\n\nIn the case of a phantom unmixed module M , the set Ass Ph M is finite, so the\nsmaller set T M is certainly finite. Also, since any q \u2208 Ass Ph M is a minimal prime of\nM , the same is true for any q \u2208 T M , so for any such q there is some positive integer\nL with qL Mq = 0. Let N = L + \u03bc(q) \u2212 1. Then qN q \u2286 (q[q] )N \u2212\u03bc(q)+1 = (qL )[q] , so\n[q]\nthat qN q F e (Mq ) \u2286 (qL Mq )Mq = 0 for any power q of p, which certainly proves (b).\nThen by the theorem, tight closure commutes with localization for 0 \u2286 M .\n8. Diagram-chasing with exponents\nGiven a short exact sequence of complexes of modules, classical homological algebra shows us that there is an associated long exact sequence of homology modules,\nfrom which we can derive useful criteria for vanishing and other properties of the\nhomology modules in question. On the other hand, if we only have a short stably\nphantom exact sequence of complexes of finitely-generated R-modules, I do not\nknow how to obtain a useful long sequence of modules. However, in some important ways, we may act as if we had such a long sequence, as I make precise in the\nmain result of this section, Proposition 8.4. Along the way we will define \"phantom\nconnecting homomorphisms,\" and I hope that these along with Proposition 8.4 will\nbe useful additions to the ever-expanding toolbox of tight closure theory.\nThroughout this section, let R be a Noetherian ring of prime characteristic p > 0\nwhich contains a q0 -weak test element c, and let\n\u03b2.\n\n\u03b1.\n\n0 \u2192 L. \u2192 M. \u2192 N. \u2192 0\nbe a sequence of complexes of finitely generated R-modules, which is a complex in\neach degree, and such that for each i \u2208 and every positive integer e \u2265 0, we have:\n\nZ\n\n\u2022 \u03b2i is surjective,\n\u2022 ker F e (\u03b2i ) \u2286 (im F e (\u03b1i ))\u2217F e (Mi ) , and\n\u2022 ker F e (\u03b1i ) \u2286 0\u2217F e (Li ) .\nIn other words, we have a stably phantom exact complex in each degree. We call\nthis a short stably phantom exact sequence of complexes.\nThe point is that although there seems to be no long exact sequence which arises\nfrom this situation, we can get the same kind of benefits that we would get out of\na long exact sequence, \"up to tight closure.\"\nTo simplify notation, we will abuse it by assuming the reader can keep track of\nthe Frobenius powers on the maps, in the same manner as in Section 2.\n\n\fPHANTOM DEPTH AND STABLE PHANTOM EXACTNESS.\n\n25\n\n8.1.

A three-term complex A \u2192 B \u2192 C of finitely generated Rmodules is stably phantom exact if and only if for all e (equiv. for all e \u226b 0), the\ninduced maps Ge (B/im \u03b1) \u2192 Ge (C) are injective.\nProof. The first thing is to show that for any such 3-term complex, for every e there\nis an induced map Ge (B/im \u03b1) \u2192 Ge (C). It is enough to show it for e = 0, since\nthe tensor product of a complex with e R is still a complex. The map will be induced\nfrom \u03b2, so what needs to be shown is that \u03b2((im \u03b1)\u2217 ) \u2286 0\u2217C . But if y \u2208 (im \u03b1)\u2217 , then\ncy q \u2208 im F e (\u03b1) for all e \u226b 0, say cy q = \u03b1(xq ), so c\u03b2(y)q = \u03b2(\u03b1(xq )) = 0, which\nsince this holds for all q \u226b 0, \u03b2(y) \u2208 0\u2217C . Thus, the induced maps are well-defined.\nNow suppose that the complex is stably phantom exact, and take some e and\n\u2032\nsome y \u2208 F e (B) such that \u03b2(y) \u2208 0\u2217F e (C) . Then for all q \u2032 \u226b 0, \u03b2(cy q ) = 0, so\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ncy q \u2208 (im \u03b1)\u2217 , and thus c1 y q q0 \u2208 im \u03b1, whence y \u2208 (im \u03b1)\u2217 . This shows that the\ninduced maps are injective for all e.\nConversely, suppose the induced maps are injective for e \u226b 0. Then take any e\n\u2032\nand any y \u2208 F e (B) such that \u03b2(y) = 0. Then for any e\u2032 \u226b 0, the fact that \u03b2(y q ) =\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03b2(y)q = 0 implies by injectivity of the induced maps that y q \u2208 (im \u03b1)\u2217F e+e\u2032 (B) .\n\u2032\n\n[q\u2032 q ]\n\n\u2032\n\n0\nThus cy q q0 \u2208 im F e+e +e0 (\u03b1) = (im F e (\u03b1))F e (B)\n, so y \u2208 (im F e (\u03b1))\u2217F e (B) , showing\nthat the complex is stably phantom exact.\n\u0003\n\n9.

Then let\nF \u221e (M ) = lim F e (M ),\n\u2192\n\nwhere the maps in the direct limit system send z \u2208 F e (M ) to z p \u2208 F e+1 (M ). Let\nF \u221e (\u03b1) : F \u221e (M ) \u2192 F \u221e (N )\nsend the image of an element z \u2208 F e (M ) in F \u221e (M ) to the image of F e (\u03b1)(z) \u2208\nF e (N ) in F \u221e (N ). It is easy to show that not only is this well-defined, but it makes\nF \u221e into an endofunctor on the category of R-modules. If (C., d.) is a complex of\nR-modules, then (F \u221e (C)., F \u221e (d).) is defined by F \u221e (C)i = F \u221e (Ci ) and F \u221e (d)i =\nF \u221e (di ). The fact that F \u221e is a functor is enough to show that this new sequence\nis itself a complex.\nAny element of F \u221e (M ) can be represented as the image of an element z \u2208 F e (M )\nfor some e. Denote the corresponding element of F \u221e (M ) by hzie . Note that we\nalways have hzie = hz p ie+1 .\nLemma 10.2. Let (C., d.) be a complex of R-modules over a Noetherian ring of\ncharacteristic p > 0. Fix some integer i. Then F \u221e (C). is exact at i if and only if\nker F e (di ) \u2286 (im F e (di+1 ))F\nF e (Ci ) for all e \u2265 0.\nProof. First suppose that F \u221e (C). is exact at i. Let z \u2208 ker F e (di ). Then\nF \u221e (d)i (hzie ) = hF e (di )(z)ie = h0ie = 0.\n\u221e\n\u221e\nThus, by exactness, hziD\ne \u2208 im F (d)i+1 . SayEhzie = F (d)i+1 (hyin ). Without loss\nn\u2212e\nof generality n \u2265 e, so z p\n\u2212 F n (di+1 )(y) = 0. Then for some t \u2265 n,\nn\n\nt\u2212e\n\nzp\n\nt\u2212n\n\n\u2212 F t (di+1 )(y p\n\n\u0010 n\u2212e\n\u0011pt\u2212n\n) = zp\n\u2212 F n (di+1 )(y)\n= 0.\n[pt\u2212e ]\n\nt\u2212e\n\nThat is, z p\n\u2208 im F t (di+1 ) = (im F e (di+1 ))F e (Ci ) , so that z \u2208 (im F e (di+1 ))F\nF e (Ci ) .\ne\ne\nF\nConversely, suppose that ker F (di ) \u2286 (im F (di+1 ))F e (Ci ) for all e, and let\nhzin \u2208 ker F \u221e (d)i . Then hF n (di )(z)in = 0, which means that for some m \u2265 0,\nm\nF n+m (di )(z p ) = 0. So we have that\nm\n\nz p \u2208 ker F n+m (di ) \u2286 (im F n+m (di+1 ))F\nF n+m (Ci ) .\nm+t\n\nThus, for some t \u2265 0, z p\n\n[pt ]\n\n\u2208 (im F n+m (di+1 ))F n+m (Ci ) = im F n+m+t (di+1 ). Say\n\nm+t\n\nzp\n\n= F n+m+t (di+1 )(y). Then\nD m+t E\nhzin = z p\n= F n+m+t (di+1 )(y)\nn+m+t\n\nwhich proves exactness of F \u221e (C). at i.\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\nn+m+t\n\n= F \u221e (d)i+1 (hyin+m+t ),\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 10.3. Let 0 \u2192 L \u2192 M \u2192 N \u2192 0 be a complex of modules over a local\nNoetherian ring R of characteristic p > 0. Then the following are equivalent:\n(a) The following three conditions hold:\ni. \u03b2 is surjective,\n\n\f34\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN\n\nii. ker F e (\u03b2) \u2286 (im F e (\u03b1))F\nF e (M) for all e, and\ne\nF\niii. ker F (\u03b1) \u2286 0F e (L) for all e.\n(b) The sequence 0 \u2192 F \u221e (L)\n\nF \u221e (\u03b1)\n\n\u2192\n\nF \u221e (M )\n\nF \u221e (\u03b2)\n\n\u2192\n\nF \u221e (N ) \u2192 0 is exact.\n\nProof. This is a special case of Lemma 10.2. The only part that remains to be seen\nis the relationship of the surjectivity of \u03b2 to exactness at F \u221e (N ). If \u03b2 is surjective,\nthen so is F e (\u03b2) for all e because of the right-exactness of Frobenius, from which it\neasily follows that F \u221e (\u03b2) is surjective. On the other hand, if F \u221e (\u03b2) is surjective,\n\u2217\nthen by Lemma 10.2, N \u2286 (im \u03b2)F\nN . Hence N \u2286 (im \u03b2)N , which implies that\nN = im \u03b2.\n\u0003\nFrom these results, along with the fact that direct limits are exact and thus\ncommute with homology, one can show that analogues of Lemma 8.3 and Proposition 8.4 hold for Frobenius closure.\nRemark: The same kind of thing can be done with \"plus closure\", and it's even\neasier. Recall: if R is an integral domain and j : L \u0592\u2192 M is an inclusion of Rmodules, then by definition the plus closure of L in M , denoted L+\nM , is the set of\nall elements x \u2208 M such that for some module-finite extension S of R, 1 \u2297 x \u2208 LS ,\nwhere LS is the image of the map S \u2297 j : S \u2297R L \u2192 S \u2297R M . Equivalently, if we\nlet R+ denote a direct limit of all module-finite extensions of R (equivalently, R+\nis the integral closure of R in an algebraic closure of its fraction field), then L+\nM is\nthe preimage in M of the image of the map R+ \u2297 j in R+ \u2297R M . For a complex\nC. of R-modules, C + . is defined in the obvious way.\nIt should be clear to the reader that for a complex (C., d.) and an integer i, C + .\nis exact at i if and only if ker(S \u2297R di ) \u2286 (im (S \u2297R di+1 ))+\nS\u2297R Ci for all module-finite\nextensions S of R, which gives us a result analogous to Corollary 10.3 and hence\nvery easily versions of Lemma 8.3 and Proposition 8.4 for plus closure.\nOne would hope that there is a similarly straightforward way to prove Lemma 8.3\nand Proposition 8.4 as well.\nAcknowledgements\nI warmly thank my graduate advisor, Professor Craig Huneke, for his support,\nguidance, and ideas.
