Several\ngroups introduced their evolutionary synthesis codes, e.g.,\nBruzual & Charlot (1993) [b&c], Leitherer et al. (1999)\n[starburst99], Fioc & Rocca \u2013 Volmerange (1997) [pegase], Fritze \u2013 v. Alvensleben & Gerhard (1994) [galev] (all\nwith regular updates), with various input physics (evolutionary tracks vs. isochrones from various groups, different sets\nof stellar spectral libraries, extinction laws ...). The codes do\nnot only vary in terms of input physics but also regarding\ncomputational implementation, interpolation routines etc.\nA number of publications deals with the intercomparison\nof various evolutionary synthesis codes (e.g. Worthey 1994,\nCharlot et al. 1996). The impact of uncertainties in the var-\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: panders@uni-sw.gwdg.de\n\nc 2003 RAS\n\nious model parameters (such as in the descriptions of overshooting and mass loss, stellar spectral libraries etc.) on the\nresulting colours is challenged by Yi (2003). These publications find a good general agreement among the various models, and assign acceptable uncertainties to the model results.\nYi (2003) points out the importance of a proper choice of\nfilters for observing objects characterised by different age\nranges. This is justified by the light being dominated by\nstars in different evolutionary stages at different times. The\nage-metallicity degeneracy is a major drawback for accurate\nage determinations, especially for young ages \u2264 200 Myr.\nIn addition to the choice of the specific evolutionary synthesis model used another important\ncaveat merits discussion here. A common assumption\nin dealing with evolutionary synthesis is a well-populated\nstellar initial mass function (IMF), up to the model's upper\nmass limit. While this is probably a justifiable assumption\nfor galaxy-sized systems (although uncertainties regarding\nthe IMF slope persist), it certainly breaks down at levels\nof small (open) star clusters and OB associations, where\n\n\f2\n\nP. Anders et al.\n\nstars are formed purely stochastically (by consumption of\nthe available amount of gas), and these statistics dominate\nthe observed dispersion in cluster luminosities. A great deal\nof progress has been achieved already on this topic, in particular by Cervi\u00f1o and collaborators (e.g. Cervi\u00f1o et al. 2002,\nCervi\u00f1o & Valls-Gabaud 2003). The main conclusion is that\nfor systems more massive than \u2248 105 M\u2299 the impact of the\nstochasticity of the IMF on the results is \u2013 in general \u2013 low,\nand the UV continuum is least affected by stochastic dispersions.\nThe studies referred to before concentrated on\nthe models themselves. When comparing the model\nresults with observations, in order to constrain the\ncluster parameters age, metallicity, internal extinction, and mass, one does not only need to take into\naccount the model uncertainties, however. The final\nparameter uncertainties also depend on the observational errors, the choice of passbands used, their\nnumber, spectral coverage and individual filter properties, and the analysis algorithm applied to one's\ndata. The most common way of model-observation\ncomparison for astrophysical purposes is the chisquared minimisation technique, used e.g. for parameter determination of star clusters (e.g. Maoz\net al. 2001, de Grijs et al. 2003a,b), determination\nof star formation histories of galaxies (e.g. Gavazzi\net al. 2002), and photometric redshift determination (e.g. Massarotti et al. 2001). Slightly different,\nbut comparable algorithms, like the least-squares\nmethod (e.g. Ma et al. 2002) or maximum-likelihood\nestimation (e.g. Gil de Paz & Madore 2002, Bik et\nal. 2003), are used as well. However, see Bissantz\n& Munk (2001) for a critical discussion about the\napplicability of chi-squared versus least-squares criteria.\nThe aim of the present paper is a systematic\nevaluation of inherent uncertainties in the analysis\nof observed star cluster spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) using evolutionary synthesis models. We define an SED as an ensemble of (absolute) magnitudes in a given set of (broad-band) passbands. We\npay special attention to the most appropriate choice\nof passbands to improve future observation strategies. We will point out severe pitfalls, such as trends\ncaused by finite observational errors and unjustified\na priori assumptions.\n\n2\n\nMODEL DESCRIPTION\n\nIn section 2.1 we present the basic properties of\nour evolutionary synthesis models. Section 2.2 is a\ngeneral description of our cluster SED analysis algorithm, regardless of whether it is used to study\nthe parameters of observed star clusters or of simulated artificial clusters. In section 2.3 we present the\nspecific properties of the artificial clusters (clusters\nfor which SEDs are taken directly from our models) used to simulate observed clusters and study\nthe performance of our analysis tool. From section\n3 onwards only these artificial clusters are used.\n\n2.1\n\nInput Models\n\nWe use the single stellar population (SSP) models presented\nin Schulz et al. (2002), with important improvements regarding the treatment of gaseous emission in the early stages of\nthe cluster evolution, as presented in Anders & Fritze \u2013 v.\nAlvensleben (2003). These models include isochrones from\nthe Padova group including the TP-AGB phase, and model\natmosphere spectra from Lejeune et al. (1997; 1998). These\nextend from 90 \u00c5 through 160 \u03bcm for five different metallicities, Z = 0.0004, 0.004, 0.008, 0.02 = Z \u2299 and 0.05 or\n[Fe/H] = \u22121.7, \u22120.7, \u22120.4, 0 and +0.4 (i.e., matching the\nmetallicities of the Padova isochrones), and gaseous emission (both lines and continuum) due to the ionising flux\nfrom young massive stars. The models can be retrieved\nfrom http://www.uni-sw.gwdg.de/\u223cgalev/panders/. For a\ngeneral description of the stellar models see Bertelli et al.\n(1994) and Girardi et al. (2000), for details about the specific isochrones in our models see Schulz et al. (2002).\nAll calculations presented here are based on a Salpeter\nIMF in the mass range of 0.15 to approximately 70 M\u2299 (0.15\nto approx. 50 M\u2299 for super-solar metallicity; following from\nthe Padova isochrones). Stellar synthesis models for a Scalo\nIMF are presented in Schulz et al. (2002) and Anders &\nFritze \u2013 v. Alvensleben (2003), and are available from the\naforementioned WWW address.\n\n2.2\n\nGeneral description of the analysis algorithm\n\nIn order to analyse observed SEDs of star clusters in terms of\nthe individual cluster's age, metallicity, extinction, and mass\nwe calculate a grid of models for a large range of values for\neach of these parameters (except mass, which is a simple scaling of the model mass [Mmodel = 1.6 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 ]\nto the absolute observed cluster magnitudes). Input\nparameters for the analysis are the time evolution of the\nspectra of the SSP models, and the derived magnitude evolution in the various passbands.\nThe individual uncertainties contributing to the\noverall photometric uncertainties are: the observational uncertainties, an estimated model uncertainty of 0.1\nmag, and an uncertainty of an additional 0.1 mag for passbands bluewards of the B band due to known calibration\nand model problems in the UV. The total uncertainty is the\nsquare-root of the quadratic sum of these individual errors.\nThe observational and model uncertainties are expected to\nbe independent.\nGalactic extinction is taken into account by dereddening\nthe observations using the Galactic extinction values from\nSchlegel et al. (1998).\nFirst, we calculated dust-reddened spectra, using the\nstarburst galaxy extinction law by Calzetti et al. (2000),\nassuming a foreground screen geometry,\nk \u2032 (\u03bb) = 2.659 \u00d7 (\u22121.857 + 1.040/\u03bb) + 4.05\nfor 0.63 \u03bcm \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 2.20\u03bcm,\nk \u2032 (\u03bb) = 2.659 \u00d7 (\u22122.156 + 1.509/\u03bb \u2212 0.198/\u03bb2 + 0.011/\u03bb3 ) + 4.05\nfor 0.09 \u03bcm \u2264 \u03bb < 0.63\u03bcm\n\nwith a reddened flux\nFred (\u03bb) = F0 (\u03bb) \u00d7 100.4\u00d7Es (B\u2212V )\u00d7k\n\n\u2032\n\n(\u03bb)\n\nc 2003 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fSystematic uncertainties in SED analysis\nand a range of values for the colour excess of the stellar\ncontinuum Es (B \u2212V ). Since the gaseous emission is relevant\nonly for a short time and even then not the dominating\nterm, the difference between the colour excess of the stellar\ncontinuum and that from nebular gas emission lines (e.g.\nCalzetti et al. 2000), is neglected.\nWe emphasise that the Calzetti law is valid only for starburst galaxies, while for \"normal\" galaxies (i.e., undisturbed\nand quiescent spiral and elliptical galaxies) it is probably at\nleast marginally incorrect (due to the lower dust content\nin such galaxies). However, for our systematic uncertainty\nanalysis, the specific shape of the extinction law assumed is\nof minor importance.\nWe construct SEDs from these models by folding the\nspectra with a large number of filter response functions to\nobtain absolute magnitudes. The parameter resolutions\nare:\n\u2022 Age: 4 Myr resolution for ages from 4 Myr \u2013 2.36 Gyr,\n20 Myr resolution for ages from 2.36 Gyr \u2013 14 Gyr;\n\u2022 Extinction: the resolution is \u2206E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.05 mag,\nfor E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.0 \u2212 1.0 mag;\n\u2022 Metallicities: [Fe/H] = \u22121.7, \u22120.7, \u22120.4, 0 and +0.4, as\ngiven by the Padova isochrones;\n\u2022 Mass: an arbitrary model mass of Mmodel = 1.6 \u00d7\n109 M\u2299 is used.\nWhen comparing our observed SEDs with the\nmodel SEDs we first determine the mass of the cluster by shifting the model SED onto the observed\nSED.\nA number of these model SEDs (for Mcluster =\nMmodel ) are shown in Fig. 1, for the 5 available metallicities and for 5 representative ages used for the artificial clusters considered in this paper (see Section\n2.3).\nEach of the models in our grid is now assigned a certain probability to be the most appropriate one, given by\na likelihood estimator of the form p \u223c exp(\u2212\u03c72 ), where\nP (mobs \u2212mmodel )2\n\u03c72 =\n, where mobs and mmodel are the ob2\n\u03c3obs\nserved and the model magnitudes in each band, respectively,\nand \u03c3obs are the observational uncertainties. The summation\nis over all filters. Clusters with unusually large \"best\" \u03c72 are\nrejected, since this is an indication of calibration errors, features not included in the models (such as Wolf-Rayet star\ndominated spectra, objects younger than 4 Myr, etc.) or\nproblems due to the limited resolution of the parameters.\nThe cut-off level is set to a total probability \u2264 10\u221220 , corresponding to a \u03c72best \u2265 46. The total probability per cluster\nis then normalised.\nSubsequently, the model with the highest probability\nis chosen as the \"best-fit model\". Models with decreasing\nprobabilities are summed up until reaching 68.26 per cent\ntotal probability (= 1 \u03c3 confidence interval) to estimate the\nuncertainties in the best-fitting model. These uncertainties\nare in fact upper limits, since their determination does not\ntake into account effects like the existence of several solution\n\"islands\" for one cluster (such as e.g. the age-metallicity degeneracy, see below), and discretisation in parameter space.\nFor real observations, several passband combinations\n(containing at least 4 passbands) were used for the analysis,\nto minimise the impact of calibration errors and statistical\nc 2003 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n3\n\neffects. A minimum of 4 passbands is required to determine\nthe 4 free parameters age, metallicity, extinction and mass\nindependently (see also Anders et al. 2003, de Grijs et al.\n2003a,b).\nOnly clusters with observational errors \u2264 0.2 mag in all\npassbands of a particular combination are included to minimise the uncertainties in the results (except for some artificial clusters considered in this paper, for which we adopt\nerrors = 0.3 mag). For each combination, the best-fitting\nmodels and their associated parameter uncertainties are determined. For a given cluster all best-fitting models (and\nthe associated uncertainties) originating from the different\npassband combinations are compared. For each of these bestfitting models the product P of the relative uncertainties\nP=\n\nage+\nage\u2212\n\n\u00d7\n\nmass+\nmass\u2212\n\n\u00d7\n\nmetallicity Z+\nmetallicity Z\u2212\n\nis calculated (the superscripts indicate the 1\u03c3 upper (+ )\nand lower (\u2212 ) limits, respectively). The relative uncertainty\nin the extinction is not taken into account, since the lower\nextinction limit is often zero. The data set with the lowest\nvalue of this product is adopted as the most representative\nset of parameters (with its corresponding parameter uncertainties) for the particular cluster being analysed. In cases\nwhere the algorithm converges to a single model, a generic\nuncertainty of 30 per cent for all parameters is assumed, in\nlinear space, corresponding to an uncertainty of +0.1\n\u22120.15 dex in\nlogarithmic parameter space. See also Anders et al. (2003)\nfor an application to the star clusters in the dwarf starburst\ngalaxy NGC 1569, and de Grijs et al. (2003a,b) for applications of this algorithm to clusters in the interacting starburst\ngalaxies NGC 3310 and NGC 6745.\n\n2.3\n\nArtificial clusters\n\nIn this study we will use artificial clusters to investigate\nthe uncertainties related to our analysis on the basis of a\ncomparison with the model grid. The SED magnitudes\nof the \"ideal\" artificial clusters are taken directly\nfrom the models. Standard parameters of these clusters\nare: metallicity [Fe/H] = 0.0 = [Fe/H]\u2299 , internal extinction\nE(B \u2212 V ) = 0.1, and ages of 8 Myr (\"cluster 1\"), 60 Myr\n(\"cluster 2\"), 200 Myr (\"cluster 3\"), 1 Gyr (\"cluster 4\"),\nand 10 Gyr (\"cluster 5\"). In this standard set only a age\nvariations, and neither metallicity nor extinction variations\nare considered initially, for reasons of clarity. The impact\nof varying the metallicity and extinction values is treated\nseparately, see especially Sect. 3.3. The cluster mass is the\nmodel's mass 1.6\u00d7109 M\u2299 , the \"observational\" errors are set\nto be 0.1 mag in each filter. Unless otherwise indicated, the\nclusters in this paper will have these standard parameters.\nFor each of these 5 sets of artificial cluster parameters\n10,000 cluster SEDs were generated by adding statistical\nnoise to the magnitudes of the \"ideal\" cluster. The errors\nare drawn from a Gaussian distribution with the Gaussian\n\u03c3 corresponding to the \"observational\" uncertainty (= 0.1\nmag as standard value).\nAll clusters are analysed separately with our algorithm\nin order to assess under which conditions and to what accuracy their input parameters are recovered by our method.\nSubsequently, all clusters originating from a given \"ideal\"\ncluster are used to calculate median parameters and their as-\n\n\f4\n\n-24.5\n\n-24.5\n\n-24.5\n\n-24\n\n-24\n\n-24\n\n-24\n\n-24.5\n-24\n\n-23.5\n\n-23.5\n\n-23.5\n\n-23.5\n\n-23.5\n\n-23\n\n-23\n\n-23\n\n-23\n\n-23\n\n-22.5\n\n-22.5\n\n-22.5\n\n-22.5\n\n-22.5\n\n-22\n\n-22\n\n-22\n\n-22\n\n-22\n\n-21.5\n\n-21.5\n\n-21.5\n\n-21.5\n\n-21.5\n\nZ=0.0004, age=8 Myr\n\n-21\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nZ=0.004, age=8 Myr\n\n-21\nH\n\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nZ=0.008, age=8 Myr\n\n-21\nH\n\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nZ=0.02, age=8 Myr\n\n-21\nH\n\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n-23\n\n-23\n\n-23\n\n-23\n\n-23\n\n-22.5\n\n-22.5\n\n-22.5\n\n-22.5\n\n-22.5\n\n-22\n\n-22\n\n-22\n\n-22\n\n-22\n\n-21.5\n\n-21.5\n\n-21.5\n\n-21.5\n\n-21.5\n\n-21\n\n-21\n\n-21\n\n-21\n\n-21\n\n-20.5\n\n-20.5\n\n-20.5\n\n-20.5\n\n-20.5\n\n-20\n\n-20\nZ=0.0004, age=60 Myr\n\n-19.5\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n-20\nZ=0.004, age=60 Myr\n\n-19.5\nH\n\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n-20\nZ=0.008, age=60 Myr\n\n-19.5\nH\n\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nH\n\n-22\n\n-22\n\n-22\n\n-22\n\n-22\n\n-21.5\n\n-21.5\n\n-21.5\n\n-21.5\n\n-21\n\n-21\n\n-21\n\n-21\n\n-21\n\n-20.5\n\n-20.5\n\n-20.5\n\n-20.5\n\n-20.5\n\n-20\n\n-20\n\n-20\n\n-20\n\n-20\n\n-19.5\n\n-19.5\n\n-19.5\n\n-19.5\n\n-19.5\n\n-19\n\n-19\nZ=0.0004, age=200 Myr\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n-19\nZ=0.004, age=200 Myr\n\n-18.5\nH\n\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n-19\nZ=0.008, age=200 Myr\n\n-18.5\nH\n\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n-21\n\n-21\n\n-21\n\n-21\n\n-20\n\n-20\n\n-20\n\n-20\n\n-20\n\n-19\n\n-19\n\n-19\n\n-19\n\n-19\n\n-18\n\n-18\n\n-18\n\n-18\n\n-18\n\n-17\nZ=0.0004, age=1 Gyr\n\n-16\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n-17\nZ=0.004, age=1 Gyr\n\n-16\nH\n\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n-17\nZ=0.008, age=1 Gyr\n\n-16\nH\n\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n-20\n\n-20\n\n-20\n\n-20\n\n-19\n\n-19\n\n-19\n\n-19\n\n-19\n\n-18\n\n-18\n\n-18\n\n-18\n\n-18\n\n-17\n\n-17\n\n-17\n\n-17\n\n-17\n\n-16\n\n-16\n\n-16\n\n-16\n\n-16\n\n-15\n\n-15\n\n-15\n\n-15\n\n-15\n\n-14\n\n-14\n\n-14\n\n-14\n\n-13\nZ=0.0004, age=10 Gyr\n\n-12\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n-13\nZ=0.004, age=10 Gyr\n\n-12\nH\n\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n-12\nH\n\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nR\n\nZ=0.05, age=60 Myr\nJ\n\nH\n\nZ=0.05, age=200 Myr\nI\n\nJ\n\nH\n\nZ=0.05, age=1 Gyr\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nH\n\n-13\nZ=0.02, age=10 Gyr\n\n-12\nH\n\nU B V\n\nH\n\n-14\n\n-13\nZ=0.008, age=10 Gyr\n\nI\n\n-16\nH\n\n-20\n\n-13\n\nR\n\nJ\n\n-17\nZ=0.02, age=1 Gyr\n\n-16\nH\n\nU B V\n\n-18.5\nH\n\n-21\n\n-17\n\nI\n\n-19\nZ=0.02, age=200 Myr\n\n-18.5\nH\n\nR\n\n-19.5\n\n-21.5\n\n-18.5\n\nU B V\n\n-20\nZ=0.02, age=60 Myr\n\n-19.5\nH\n\nZ=0.05, age=8 Myr\n\n-21\nH\n\nU B V\n\nR\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nZ=0.05, age=10 Gyr\n\n-12\nH\n\nJ\n\nH\n\nP.

The uncertainties are centred around\nthe median solution; they serve as equivalents to the 1\u03c3 standard deviation around the average values. However, for our\nanalysis we chose to use the median instead of the average of\nthe distribution, since we believe the median to be physically\nmore relevant. We are interested in finding the most likely\nresult when comparing our model grid with observations.\nFree parameters are the metallicity [Fe/H], the extinction E(B \u2212 V ), log(age) and log(mass). [Fe/H] and log(age)\nare used instead of Z and age because the evolution of magnitudes is approximately linear in [Fe/H] and log(age).\n\n3\n\nSTUDY OF THE ACCURACY OF OUR\nANALYSIS\n\n3.1\n\nPassbands included in our analysis\n\nWe consider the following filters (the impact of only slightly\ndifferent filter response curves is small). All filters are taken\nfrom the set of available filters for observations of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/WFPC2, ACS, and NICMOS\ncameras.\nThe standard set of filters is: HST WFPC2 (and ACS)\nfilters F336W (\"U\"), F439W (\"B\"), F555W (\"V\"), F675W\n(\"R\"), F814W (\"I\"), NICMOS (NIC2 camera) F110W\n(\"J\"), F160W (\"H\"). This standard set will be referred to as\n\"UBVRIJH\". In addition the following filters are included\nin our study as well: the HST WFPC2 (and ACS where appropriate) wide filters F300W (\"wide U\"), F450W (\"wide\nB\"), F606W (\"wide V\"), F702W (\"wide R\") and the HST\nStr\u00f6mgren filters F336W (\"u\" \u2261 \"U\"), F410M (\"v\"), F467M\n(\"b\"), F547M (\"y\").\nIn this paper we will use the term \"UV passband\" essentially for the U band, and the term \"NIR\npassbands\" for the J and H bands.\nIn the relevant figures, the horizontal lines mark the\ninput values, and the symbols represent the median of the\nrecovered values with the associated uncertainties. The clusters with \"cluster number\" = 1 \u2264 x < 2 are clusters with the\nyoungest input age of 8 Myr, clusters with \"cluster number\"\n= 2 \u2264 x < 3 are clusters with an input age of 60 Myr, and\nso on (this offset is chosen for reasons of clarity).\n3.2\n\nChoice of passband combination\n\nFirst, we investigate which passbands contain the maximum\namount of information, and hence which passbands are preferred for observations, if one can obtain observations in only\na limited number of passbands. This aims at improving future observing strategies.\n3.2.1\n\nImportance of individual passbands\n\nIn Fig. 2 we present the dispersions in our recovered parameters using the standard input parameters, and SEDs covering the full wavelength range UBVRIJH, compared with\npassband combinations where one of the UBVRIJH passbands is left out.\nThis figure provides direct evidence of the importance\nof the U band (and to a lesser degree also of the B band)\nfor all stages of cluster evolution, while for ages > 1 Gyr\nc 2003 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n5\n\nalso a lack of the V band results in problems to recover the\nage. The systematic deviations from the input values for the\ncombinations without the U or B bands are caused by an\ninsufficiently accurate determination of the cluster metallicity. The resulting SED changes are therefore balanced by\nthe analysis algorithm by adjusting the extinction and/or\nage, and are also accompanied by higher-than-input median\nmasses in our fit results.\nSystematic biases are only apparent in the age determination of the oldest artificial cluster (with a slight bias\ntowards younger recovered ages), balanced by an overestimate of the internal extinction (which is a sign of the ageextinction degeneracy) and a minor bias towards smaller\nmedian masses. For the 60 Myr-old artificial cluster, the\nmetallicity determination leads to an underestimate (presumably due to the criss-crossing of the models and/or the\nnon-negligible impact of the age-metallicity degeneracy at\nthese ages) for all passband combinations, while for the oldest cluster the uncertainty in the metallicity determination\nencompasses almost the entire available range.\nIn general, the median values recovered by our code\nagree fairly well with the input parameters, with the exceptions mentioned above. The parameter dispersions are\nlargest for the young (ages \u2264 60 Myr) and the oldest (age =\n10 Gyr) clusters. This is caused by the criss-crossing of the\nmodels for young ages and the flat magnitude evolution for\nold ages.\nThe importance of the U and B band is immediately apparent from the overview of artificial SEDs presented in Fig.\n1. U and B are important for tracing the hook-like structure\nfor young ages, while there appears to be a kink in the SEDs\nat the V band for older ages.\n3.2.2\n\nCombinations of 4 passbands\n\nThe minimum number of passbands required to determine\nthe 4 free parameters age, metallicity, extinction and mass\nindependently is four.\nIn Figs. 3 and 4 we present the recovered parameters\nfor UBVRIJH compared with various passband combinations consisting of 4 passbands, for optical filters only and\nincluding one near-infrared (NIR) band, respectively.\nFor optical passbands only, the U band plays a major role once more, especially in determining the metallicity.\nMissing U-band information leads to underestimates of the\nmetallicity, thereby causing extinction values and ages to be\nadjusted improperly, and hence this also leads to incorrect\nmass estimates. Even in cases where the median is recovered correctly, such clusters show the largest uncertainties.\nIn some cases, missing B-band information has similar effects, especially for the youngest cluster, while for the oldest cluster the B band is vital to break the age-extinction\ndegeneracy. Only for the oldest cluster, the V band contains\nvital information, which is in accordance with our results in\nSect. 3.2.1.\nFor optical+NIR passbands, the situation is similar:\nThe U band (and to a lesser degree also the B band) is essential. Generally, the offsets from the input values and the\nuncertainty ranges are smaller than for optical passbands\nonly, thus proving the importance of NIR data. Choosing\na NIR band closely resembling the K band instead of J or\nH would give similar results, possibly restricting the values\n\n\f6\n\nP.

Cluster parameters are standard.\n\nslightly better. However, we concentrated on the H band\nsince there are more observations available in H in the HST\ndata archive than for filters with longer central wavelengths.\nIn Fig. 4 we also see the effect of a limited wavelength coverage: in all parameters, the RIJH combination gives the worst results (see also de Grijs et\nal. 2003a). Similar, but less pronounced is the effect\nfor the UBVR combination.\nFig. 5 compares the normal WFPC2 UBVR system with\nthe corresponding passband combination using the WFPC2\nwide filters. In addition, results based on the medium band\nStr\u00f6mgren filter system of WFPC2 are shown.\nIn most cases the wide filter system gives slightly worse\nresults than the standard system. However, driven by the\nwider filter response curves and the associated smaller observational errors thanks to the larger flux throughput, the\nwide system might be preferable, e.g., for faint objects.\nUsing the WFPC2 Str\u00f6mgren medium-band system\ndoes not result in significant improvements compared to\nwide-band systems. In conjunction with the lower flux\nthroughput (caused by the narrower bandwidth) this system seems less preferable for our purpose. We emphasise\nthat this only holds for our SED analysis.\nIn de Grijs et al. (2003a) we investigated the impact\nof the choice of passbands for the young cluster system\n(with ages of few \u00d710 \u2212 100 Myr) in NGC 3310 with HST\ndata from the UV through to the NIR. Starting with the\nfull set of available passbands, we studied the changes in\naccuracy of the recovered parameters if we repeated the\nanalysis using only a subset of our passbands. By comparing the results from our analyses using all passbands with\nc 2003 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nthose from smaller subsets we found severe biases in the age\ndistributions originating from different passband combinations, in particular for combinations biased towards longer\nwavelengths (VIJH), but also for UV-UBV (covering shorter\nwavelengths only) and BVIJH, consistent with the results\npresented here.\n\n3.2.3\n\nConclusions on the choice of passbands\n\nFrom these comparisons we conclude that the passband combinations for the most reliable parameter\ndetermination must include the U band, the B band,\nand use the maximum available wavelength range,\npreferably including at least one NIR band. If only\nobservations in 4 passbands can be obtained, the best combinations are UBIH or UBVH, especially for genuinely old objects, and UBVI, if NIR data cannot be acquired. We emphasise once again that tracing the kink around the B /V band\nin the SEDs (see Fig. 1) is vital. For improved metallicity determinations, and consequently for improved determinations\nof the other parameters as well, NIR data seem to be crucial (for young clusters the U /B bands are also important,\nin order to determine the metallicity correctly). However,\ndue to the limited metallicity resolution (and the numerous effects the metallicity has on the synthetic magnitudes),\nthe metallicity determination remains the weakest point in\nour cluster analysis algorithm, and presumably in any routine using synthetic magnitudes from stellar isochrones or\ntracks.\n\n\f8\n\nP.

Dispersion of recovered properties of artificial clusters, comparing various wide and medium-band HST filters, as indicated in\nthe legend. Cluster parameters are standard.\n\n3.3\n\nVarying the input parameters\n\nIn this section we investigate to which extent the input parameters can be recovered as a function of their respective\nvalues and observational errors.\n\n3.3.1\n\nUsing all 7 filters\n\nFig. 6 shows, for a range of observational uncertainties, the\nreliability of our recovered parameters if the standard set\nof filters (UBVRIJH) is available. We caution that we still\napply the model uncertainty of 0.1 mag (and an additional\nuncertainty of 0.1 mag for UV passbands).\nA slight trend towards an underestimate of the ages,\nbalanced by a slight overestimate of the internal extinction\nand an occasional underestimate of the metallicity, is seen.\nHowever, even for the largest observational errors of 0.3 mag\nthat we tested for, all recovered parameters are consistent\nwith the input parameters, within the uncertainties.\nWith increasing observational errors, there seems to be\na trend to underestimate the ages for the oldest cluster, balanced by an increasing overestimate of the internal extinction. For genuinely old cluster systems, this degeneracy can\nbe broken by restricting the extinction range. This is generally justified, since such systems are usually dust-poor, if\nnot dust-free, and show fairly homogeneous extinction distributions.\nFig. 7 shows that the degree to which our code recovers\nthe input parameters is largely independent of the input\nextinction value, with the exception of the ages recovered for\nthe oldest artificial clusters (in this latter case clear signs of\n\nthe age-extinction degeneracy are apparent). The remaining\ndeviations of the median recovered values from the input\nvalues are always less than 0.2 dex, and in most cases even\nsmaller. The deviations in metallicity and extinction are one\nstep in resolution (except for the extinction of the oldest\ncluster, which is, in most cases, 2 steps off). Small trends for\nincreasing age underestimates with lower input extinction\nare discernible.\nFig. 8 indicates good agreement between the input parameters and their recovered values for all 5 metallicities.\nMedian extinction values and metallicities match the input values very well. The age determination is correct to\n\u2206 log(age) <\n\u223c 0.25 dex. The mass is recovered very well, as\nis the extinction. The various metallicity input values are in\ngeneral correctly recovered, only in few cases a difference of\none resolution step is seen.\n3.3.2\n\nUsing the minimum of 4 filters\n\nThe following figures show the accuracy if observations in\nonly the minimum of 4 passbands are available (i.e., a\nmore realistic case). We discuss the best-suited 4-passbandcombination identified in Sect. 3.2.2, including the H band,\ni.e. the combination UBIH.\nFig. 9 shows significant trends caused by increasing observational errors, especially for the oldest clusters. For the\nother clusters, the trends are less severe, with deviations of\nless than a factor of 2, or one step in the metallicity resolution. For the oldest cluster, the deviations are up to 1 dex in\nage, 2 steps in metallicity, 0.35 mag in E(B \u2212 V ) and 0.5 dex\nin mass, for the largest observational errors, i.e. 0.3 mag.\nc 2003 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fSystematic uncertainties in SED analysis\nrecovered extinction E(B-V)\n\n10.5\n\nrecovered log(age)\n\n10\n9.5\n9\n8.5\n8\n\n9\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n1\n\n7.5\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\ncluster number\n7\n\n7mag, err=0.00\n7mag, err=0.01\n7mag, err=0.03\n7mag, err=0.05\n7mag, err=0.075\n\n6.5\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\ncluster number\n\n11\n\n0.5\nrecovered metallicity [Fe/H]\n\n10.5\nrecovered log(mass)\n\n7mag, err=0.10\n7mag, err=0.15\n7mag, err=0.20\n7mag, err=0.30\ninput values\n\n10\n9.5\n9\n8.5\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1\n\n-1.5\n\n8\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n1\n\n2\n\ncluster number\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\ncluster number\n\nFigure 6.

Dispersion of recovered properties of artificial clusters, assuming availability of UBIH magnitudes and varying internal\nextinction values, as indicated in the legend. Other parameters are standard.\n\nFig. 10 shows the recovered values for UBIH and various input extinction values. For all but the oldest cluster,\nthe recovered parameters reproduce the input values very\nwell. The offsets and uncertainties are slightly larger, but\ncomparable to the corresponding values for UBVRIJH.\nFor the oldest cluster there are pronounced trends: with\nincreasing input extinction, the recovered age, metallicity\nand mass estimates increase, while the offsets of the recovered extinction values from their input values decrease. We\nfind that the higher the input extinction, the better all input\nparameters are recovered.\nFig. 11 shows the recovered values for UBIH and various\ninput metallicities. The trends with increasing input metallicity are less obvious, except again for the oldest cluster\n(more significant metallicity underestimates and extinction\noverestimates with increasing input metallicity). This behaviour is also present, but less pronounced for the second\noldest (= 1 Gyr old) cluster. For the other, younger clusters,\nthe behaviour appears almost random. This is caused by the\nslow and steady evolution of magnitudes at large ages: with\nincreasing metallicity the magnitudes become fainter and\nthe colours redder. For younger ages the evolution of the\nmagnitudes is less linear, and they criss-cross several times.\n3.3.3\n\nConclusions on the impact of varying the input\nparameters\n\nWe have investigated the impact of varying the input parameters on the accuracy of our parameter recovery. We find\nvery good agreement, with generally small deviations, by either varying the input extinction or the input metallicity.\nc 2003 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nOnly for the oldest artificial clusters there are significant\ntrends in the recovered values with increasing input extinction and metallicity. This can be attributed to a number of\ndegeneracies. We remind the reader that the upper\nage limit of the evolutionary synthesis models is 14\nGyr.\nFor increasing observational uncertainties there are\nclear trends of increasing recovered extinction and decreasing ages (with a small increase for the youngest cluster only),\nmass (an increase for the youngest cluster only) and metallicity. The uncertainties increase as well, as expected.\nThe results using either UBVRIJH or UBIH are fairly\nsimilar. Using 4 passbands only slightly increases the offsets\nof the median recovered values from the input values, as well\nas the uncertainties. Some trends, especially for the oldest\ncluster, become more significant.\n\n3.4\n\nRestricting the parameter space to the\ncorrect ranges\n\nIn this section we investigate the consequences of a priori\nrestrictions of the parameter space. This might make sense\nin cases where, e.g., large observational errors may inhibit\nreasonable parameter constraints or where additional information is available, such as spectroscopic abundances, dynamical age estimates for the starburst event that induced\nthe cluster formation, a low-metallicity dwarf galaxy environment, etc. Here, we explore various cases where we restrict some of our free parameters to the (correct) range\nof input values, and use passband combinations UBVRIJH\n\n\f12\n\nP.

Dispersion of recovered properties of artificial clusters, assuming availability of UBVRIJH and passband combinations\nwithout one of the UBVRIJH passbands, as indicated in the legend. Solutions were sought with extinction fixed to the input value.\nCluster parameters are standard.\n\nand combinations lacking one of the UBVRIJH passbands\nto recover the input parameters.\nFig. 12 shows the results when we restrict the metallicity to the (input) solar metallicity. Apart from the oldest cluster (which shows a slight underestimate of the age,\nbalanced by a slight overestimate of the extinction) the recovered values agree almost perfectly with the input values,\nin any case much better than without metallicity restriction\n(cf. Fig. 2). The importance of the U and B bands, and of\nthe largest possible wavelength coverage are still reflected\nby the larger uncertainties for observations lacking those filters. The deviations for the oldest cluster are a result of the\nage-extinction degeneracy.\nIn Fig. 13 we investigate the consequences of restricting the analysis to the input extinction, allowing variations\nonly in metallicity and age. The deviations of the median\nsolutions from the input values, and the uncertainty ranges\nare significantly reduced compared to the unrestricted case\nshown in Fig. 2. Especially for the oldest cluster, some degeneracies are removed and the recovered values agree much\nbetter with the input values than in the unrestricted case.\nFor genuinely old cluster systems the assumption of a generic\nlow extinction may be justified, since such systems are common in old relaxed galaxies with generally low (and uniform)\ndust content.\nNevertheless, the importance of including the U and B\nbands is still apparent, especially in the age determination\nfor the youngest cluster. By comparison with Fig. 12 we can\nattribute this behaviour to the age-metallicity degeneracy.\nThe results from the restriction of both extinction and\nc 2003 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nmetallicity to their input values is presented in Fig. 14.\nClearly, all median values agree perfectly with the values of\nthe remaining input parameters. The few large uncertainty\nranges indicate passband combinations that still do not allow to determine the solutions unambiguously, because important information (passbands) are missing. Combinations\nwithout these passbands do not allow for a reasonable analysis. This includes combinations without the U or B band\n(and thus insufficient tracing of the kink in the SEDs) and\nwithout the U or H band (thereby restricting the wavelength\ncoverage). The R/I bands seem to be of some importance in\nthe early evolutionary stages to trace the curvature of the\nSEDs.\nRestricting the parameter space of our analysis to the\ninput values for some parameters clearly reproduces the input values of the others, and hence can be used as a sanity\ncheck for the reliability of the algorithm. We find the ageextinction degeneracy to be most important for old clusters;\nfor such systems a restriction in the allowed extinction range\nis usually possible. The age-metallicity degeneracy is responsible for some deviations for clusters younger than 200 Myr.\n\n3.5\n\nRestricting the parameter space to incorrect\nvalues\n\nIn this section we investigate the consequences of a priori\nassuming fixed, but incorrect generic values for the parameters.\nFirst, we investigate the results for various input metallicities, but using solar metallicity to recover the other input\n\n\f14\n\nP.

Solutions were sought with metallicity fixed to solar metallicity. Cluster parameters are standard.\n\nparameters (as often done in the literature in studies of interacting and/or merging galaxies). The results are shown\nin Figs. 15 and 16. There are significant trends in the age determination in the sense of decreasing ages with decreasing\ninput metallicity. These trends are in some cases accompanied by decreasing extinction. If the actual input metallicity\nis lower than the fixed metallicity assumed for the analysis,\nthe cluster colours will be too blue for the combined input\nage and extinction, and for the fixed incorrect metallicity.\nHence, either the recovered extinction is driven to lower values and/or the solution to younger ages than their respective\ninput values, since both adjustments result in bluer colours\nfor ages \u2265 200 Myr. The results for an actual super-solar\ninput metallicity can be understood the other way around.\nThe youngest clusters show rather randomly distributed recovered values, thereby reflecting the complex behaviour of\nthe magnitudes at such young ages. Applying solar metallicity models (as often seen in the literature) for clusters that\nintrinsically have sub-solar metallicity results in ages that\nare too low by up to 60 per cent, masses too low by up to\n56 per cent and similarly incorrect extinction values if observations in 7 passbands are available, and even more if the\nobservations were obtained in only 4 passbands.\nAn equivalent test was done for our cluster sample in\nNGC 3310, where we compared the results from assuming\na fixed, solar metallicity to leaving it as a free parameter\n(see de Grijs et al. 2003a). We found significantly different\nage distributions in either case, with the analysis in which\nthe metallicity was left as a free parameter resulting in more\nrealistic results in the context of what is known about the\nstarburst in NGC 3310 in general. However, since all clusters\nc 2003 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nare young in this cluster system (with ages of a few \u00d710\u2212100\nMyr), this test was limited to young ages.\nIn de Grijs et al. (2003b) we concentrated on the impact\nof restricting the allowed metallicity range for the analysis.\nBy assuming a generic, fixed subsolar metallicity (confirmed\nby spectroscopy), we found that the derived age distribution\nis fairly robust compared to the case where the metallicity is\nleft as a free parameter, but the peak of the age distribution\nis significantly broadened. Hence, there is a larger dispersion\nfor individual clusters. This is presumably caused by clusters\nthat do not have the generic metallicity value.\nIn Figs. 17 and 18 we show the results for UBVRIJH\nand UBIH, respectively, if clusters with various extinction\nvalues are analysed using a fixed value of E(B \u2212 V ). Shown\nare the results for clusters with input values E(B \u2212 V ) =\n0.0, 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5, but analysed assuming a fixed extinction E(B \u2212 V )fixed = 0.1. Considerable changes are observed\nin the resulting metallicities and ages. In many cases, the\ndeviations from the input values are much larger than the\nderived uncertainties. For clusters with ages >\n\u223c 200 Myr\nthere are significant trends of increasing recovered ages and\nmetallicities with increasing input extinction. If the actual\ninput extinction is smaller than the extinction fixed for the\nanalysis, the cluster will be too blue for the combination of\ninput age and metallicity, and for the fixed, incorrect extinction. Hence, either the recovered metallicity is driven to\nlower values and/or the age must be younger than the corresponding input values, since both result in bluer colours.\nThe results for an actual input extinction higher than the\nfixed value can be understood the other way around.

This is true in particular for systems where\nthe existence of two distinct cluster populations is already\nknown or suspected, such as in merging galaxies and galaxies\nwith known colour bimodality in their cluster system.\n\n4\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have presented a detailed study of the reliability and\nlimitations of our new algorithm to analyse observed SEDs\nof star clusters, based on broad-band imaging observations,\nby comparing these to a grid of model SEDs from our evolutionary synthesis code galev.\nWe have computed a large grid of star cluster SEDs on\nthe basis of our galev models for simple stellar populations\nincluding all relevant stellar evolutionary phases for ages\n\u2265 4 Myr. The models also include metallicity-dependent\ngaseous line and continuum emission shown to be an important contributor to broad-band fluxes in early evolutionary stages. Our grid covers ranges in metallicity of \u22121.7 \u2264\n[Fe/H] \u2264 +0.4, in extinction of 0 \u2264 E(B \u2212 V ) \u2264 1, and ages\nof 4 Myr \u2264 age \u2264 14 Gyr. The models produce spectra from\nwhich we derive absolute magnitudes, and hence broad-band\nSEDs, for any given filter system. Here, we present results\nfor HST broad-band filters widely used for observations and\nanalyses of star cluster systems in external galaxies.\nOur parameter analysis algorithm compares a given\ncluster SED (either observed or theoretical, as done in this\nstudy) with the model SEDs from our input parameter grid.\nEach parameter set is assigned a certain probability, based\non an \"observation\u2013model\" comparison using a chi\u2013squared\nalgorithm. The parameter set with the highest probability\nis adopted as the best model; the range of parameters from\nsets with the highest probabilities (up to a total probability of 68.26 per cent) determines the 1\u03c3 uncertainties in the\nparameters.\nWe constructed numerous artificial cluster SEDs, and\nvaried each of the input parameters in turn to assess their\neffects on the robustness of our parameter recovery. For each\nclean model artificial cluster SED we calculated 10,000 additional clusters, with errors distributed around the input\nmagnitudes in a Gaussian fashion.\nWe identified useful and less suitable passband combinations, with the aim to aid in the planning of observational campaigns. Although a large number of passbands is\nalways preferable, any realistic programme will more likely\nbe limited to observations in the minimum number of required passbands to successfully reach its goals. In order\nto successfully disentangle the three free parameters age, metallicity, and internal extinction based\non the shape of a broad-band SED, and to determine the mass of a star cluster by simple scaling of\nthe model magnitudes to the observed level, a minimum of four passbands are required.

In all cases, tracing the kink (or hook)\nin the SEDs around the B band (see Fig. 1) is of\nthe highest importance. The inclusion of at least\none NIR passband significantly improves the results,\nsince NIR wavelengths allow to efficiently restrict the metallicity range. For the youngest clusters, metallicity estimates\nare determined by the U and/or B bands. The poorest results are obtained if neither UV information nor B band\ndata are available, or if the available wavelength coverage is\nvery short or biased towards blue or red wavelengths (like\nRIJH).\nBy analysing artificial clusters, using a variety of input\nparameters (specifically age, metallicity, and internal extinction) with our new code, we find in general good agreement\nbetween the recovered and the input parameters. Only the\noldest, 10 Gyr-old artificial clusters show significant signs of\nthe well-known age-metallicity-extinction degeneracy.\nWe have considered several a priori restrictions of the\nparameter space, both to the (correct) input values and to\nsome commonly assumed values. We easily recover all remaining input values correctly if one of them is restricted,\na priori to its correct input value; this also provides a sanity check for the reliability of our code. We find the ageextinction degeneracy to be most important for old clusters.\nFor such systems, an a priori restriction of the allowed extinction range is often possible and shown to be very useful.\nThe age-metallicity degeneracy is responsible for some misinterpretations of clusters younger than 200 Myr.\nIf we, however, restrict one or more of our input parameters a priori to incorrect values (such as using, e.g., only\nsolar metallicity, as often found in the literature), large uncertainties result in the remaining parameters. While certain\nrestrictions might be justified in specific cases, we strongly\n\n\f18\n\nP. Anders et al.\n\nadvice caution in more complex cases, such as in interacting\ngalaxies or in galaxies with known colour bimodality in their\ncluster systems.\nFinally, we conclude that reliable determination\nof physical star cluster parameters is possible on the\nbasis of broad-band imaging, provided the availability of a useful set of observational passbands, containing at least four filters, a sufficiently long wavelength base line, and reasonable photometric accuracy. We show that a small, but suitably chosen filter\nset with deep observations (and the correspondingly\nsmall uncertainties) gives more reliable results than\na larger number of shallow exposures in inappropriate or redundant filters.\nThe method we have developed is a versatile and useful\ntool for the interpretation of large multi-colour data sets\nfor star clusters of different ages and in a large variety of\nenvironments, such as provided by, e.g., our ST-ECF/ESO\nastrovirtel1 project \"The Evolution and Environmental\nDependence of Star Cluster Luminosity Functions\" (PI R.\nde Grijs).\n\n5\n\nLejeune T., Cuisinier F., Buser R., 1997, A&AS 125, 229\nLejeune T., Cuisinier F., Buser R., 1998, A&AS 130, 65\nMa J., Zhou X., Chen J., Wu H., Jiang Z., Xue S., Zhu J., 2002,\nA&A 385, 404\nMaoz D., Barth A.
