When the action is free and ergodic, L\u221e (X) \u22ca \u0393 is a II1 factor containing\nL\u221e (X) as a Cartan subalgebra, i.e., a maximal abelian selfadjoint subalgebra with\nits normalizing group NL\u221e (X)\u22ca\u0393 (L\u221e (X)) generating L\u221e (X)\u22ca\u0393 as a von Neumann\nalgebra.\nTwo free, ergodic actions \u0393 y X and \u039b y Y are called W \u2217 -equivalent if the\ncorresponding group measure space von Neumann algebras are isomorphic. Also,\ntwo actions \u0393 y X and \u039b y Y are said to be conjugate if there is a measure space\nDate: November 15, 2018.\nThe first author's research is partially supported by NSF Grant 1001286.\nThe second author's research is partially supported by NSF Grant 0901510 and a grant from\nthe Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nIONUT CHIFAN AND JESSE PETERSON\n\nisomorphism \u03a6 : X \u2192 Y and a group isomorphism \u03b8 : \u0393 \u2192 \u039b such that for all\n\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 we have \u03a6(\u03b3x) = \u03b8(\u03b3)\u03a6(x) for almost every x \u2208 X.\nNaturally, a conjugacy between two actions implements an isomorphism between\nthe associated von Neumann algebras. Therefore the W \u2217 -equivalence class of an\naction always contains its conjugacy class. Moreover, when \u0393 is infinite amenable,\nthe W \u2217 -equivalence class of a free, ergodic action \u0393 y X contains all free, ergodic\nactions of all infinite amenable groups [Con76], thus being (much) larger than its\nconjugacy class. This is an instance when the von Neumann algebra arising from an\naction remembers little of the initial group/action data. The opposite phenomenon\n- when aspects of an action can be recovered from its von Neumann algebra - is\nlabeled a W \u2217 -rigidity phenomenon.\nAn extreme form of rigidity for actions is W \u2217 -superrigidity. A free, ergodic,\nmeasure preserving action \u0393 y X is called W \u2217 -superrigid if its W \u2217 -equivalence\nclass coincides with its conjugacy class. In other words, whenever \u039b y Y is a free,\nergodic, measure preserving action, any isomorphism between the von Neumann\nalgebras L\u221e (X)\u22ca\u0393 and L\u221e (Y )\u22ca\u039b entails a conjugacy between the actions \u0393 y X\nand \u039b y Y . Producing examples of W \u2217 -superrigid actions \u0393 y X is a difficult\nproblem as it incorporates two rigidity phenomena which, even individually, are\nusually hard to establish.\n(1) Orbit Equivalence (OE) superrigidity: If an arbitrary free, ergodic, p.m.p.\naction \u039b y Y is orbit equivalent with \u0393 y X, i.e., there is an isomorphism\n\u03a6 : X \u2192 Y such that \u03a6(\u0393x) = \u039b\u03a6(x) for almost every x \u2208 X, then the\nactions \u0393 y X and \u039b y Y are conjugated.\n(2) Uniqueness of group measure space Cartan subalgebras: If the von Neumann\nalgebra N = L\u221e (X)\u22ca\u0393 corresponding to the action \u0393 y X admits another\ngroup measure space decomposition N = L\u221e (Y ) \u22ca \u039b, the group measure\nspace Cartan subalgebras L\u221e (X) and L\u221e (Y ) are conjugated by a unitary\nin N .\nDue to a sustained effort over the last decade from both ergodic theory and\nPopa's deformations/rigidity theory we have now a number of examples of actions\nknown to be OE-superrigid. See, for instance [Fur99b], [Fur99a], [Kid06], [Pop07],\n[Pop08], [Ioa08], or [Kid09].\nHowever, the second problem was out of reach for an extended time. The breakthrough in this direction came only a few years ago with the seminal work of Ozawa\nand Popa [OP07]. Using techniques from deformation/rigidity theory, they showed\nthat the von Neumann algebras associated with profinite actions of products of\nnonamenable, free groups have unique Cartan subalgebras. Similar results covering\nmore general examples can be found in [OP10].\nDespite these important results, instances when an action simultaneously satisfies both forms of rigidity remained elusive. Recently, the second author managed\nto prove the existence of actions satisfying the second type of rigidity while simultaneously virtually satisfying the first type [Pet09c]. More precisely, by developing an\ninfinitesimal analysis for the resolvent deformations associated to closable derivations on von Neumann algebras, it was shown that the von Neumann algebras\narising from free, profinite actions of free products groups, \u03931 \u2217 \u03932 with \u03931 nonHaagerup, have unique group measure space Cartan subalgebra. Then, using a\nBaire category argument, results from [Ioa08] and [OP10] were combined to show\nthe existence of virtually W \u2217 -superrigid actions.\n\n\fUNIQUE GROUP-MEASURE SPACE DECOMPOSITION\n\n3\n\nShortly after, Popa and Vaes proved that arbitrary free, ergodic actions of groups\nbelonging to a large class of amalgamated free products give rise to von Neumann algebras with unique group measure space Cartan subalgebra [PV09]. When\ncombining this with either Kida's OE-superrigidity theorem in [Kid09] or with\nPopa's OE-superrigidity theorem in [Pop08] it led to concrete examples of W \u2217 superrigid actions, such an example being any free, mixing p.m.p. action of the\ngroup P SL(n, Z) \u2217Tn P SL(n, Z). The methods Popa and Vaes developed to prove\ntheir result brought a new insight to the deformation/rigidity technology through\nthe introduction of their \"transfer lemmas\". Outgrowths of these methods were\nused subsequently by Fima and Vaes to obtain examples of W \u2217 -superrigid actions\ncovering other classes of groups, e.g., HNN-extensions [FV10].\nRecently, Ioana was able to prove a striking result showing that the Bernoulli\nactions of any property (T) group is W \u2217 -superrigid [Ioa10]. While still heavily\nrelying on deformation/rigidity theory, his methods brought a considerable amount\nof innovation at the technical level. See also [IPV10] for further results in this\ndirection.\nOur paper focuses mainly on obtaining new examples of actions which give rise\nto von Neumann algebras with unique group measure space Cartan subalgebras.\nTo introduce the result we consider the class CR of all countable, infinite conjugacy\nclass groups \u0393 satisfying the following conditions:\n(1) There exists an unbounded cocycle c : \u0393 \u2192 K into a mixing representation;\n(2) There exists a non-amenable, infinite conjugacy class subgroup \u03a9 of \u0393 such\nthat the pair (\u0393, \u03a9) has relative property (T).\nUsing an approach which derives from the theory of closable derivations on von\nNeumann algebras we show that any free, ergodic p.m.p. action \u0393 y X of any\ngroup \u0393 belonging to CR gives rise to a von Neumann algebras with unique group\nmeasure space Cartan subalgebra, thus adding to the examples found in [PV09]\nand [FV10]. The reader may also consult Theorem 7.4 for a similar result covering\na class of groups larger than CR.\nMoreover, when considering products of groups belonging to class CR we obtain\nthe following:\nTheorem (Corollary 5.3 below). If 1 6 m 6 2 let \u0393 = \u03931 \u00d7* * *\u00d7\u0393m where \u0393i \u2208 CR\nfor all 1 6 i 6 2, and let \u0393 y X be a free, ergodic p.m.p. action on a probability\nspace X. If there exists another free, p.m.p. action \u039b y Y on a probability space Y\nsuch that N = L\u221e (X) \u22ca \u0393 = L\u221e (Y ) \u22ca \u039b then one can find a unitary u \u2208 N such\nthat uL\u221e (Y )u\u2217 = L\u221e (X).\n(2)\n\nIf \u0393 is a group with positive first l2 -Betti number (\u03b21 (\u0393) > 0) there exists an\nunbounded cocycle into the left regular representation [BV97, PT07], and hence \u0393\nsatisfies condition (1) above. Therefore CR contains all amalgamated free products\n\u03931 \u2217\u03a9 \u03932 which satisfy the following properties (Proposition 3.1 in [PT07]):\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n1\n> \u03b21 (\u03a9);\n\u2022 \u0393i are infinite groups such that \u03b21 (\u03931 ) + \u03b21 (\u03932 ) + |\u03a9|\n\u2022 \u03931 contains an infinite, i.c.c. group with property (T).\nSimilarly, CR contains all HNN extensions HN N (\u0393, \u03a9, \u03b8) which satisfy the following properties (Proposition 3.1 in [PT07]):\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n1\n> \u03b21 (\u03a9);\n\u2022 \u0393 is an infinite group such that \u03b21 (\u0393) + |\u03a9|\n\u2022 \u0393 contains an infinite group with property (T).\n\n\f4\n\nIONUT CHIFAN AND JESSE PETERSON\n\nIt also follows from Theorem 3.2 in [PT07] that CR contains all groups \u0393 which\nhave infinite subgroups \u03931 , \u03932 and a presentation \u0393 = h\u03931 , \u03932 | r1w1 , . . . , rkwk i for\nelements r1 , . . . , rk \u2208 \u03931 \u2217\u03932 and positive integers w1 , . . . , wk satisfying the following\nproperties:\n\u2022 ril 6= e \u2208 \u0393, for 1 < l < wi ;\n(2)\n(2)\n\u2022 1 + \u03b21 (\u03931 ) + \u03b21 (\u03932 ) \u2212 \u03a3kj=1 w1j > 0;\n\u2022 \u03931 contains an infinite, i.c.c. group with property (T).\nThe proof of the above theorem is obtained in several steps and it combines ideas\nfrom [Pet09c] and some transfer lemmas \u00e0 la Popa-Vaes (see Lemma 3.2 in [PV09]).\nWe briefly explain below the idea behind the proof in the case m = 1. First, a\nlemma similar to Lemma 3.2 in [PV09] is used to transfer, at the level of resolvent\ndeformations, the rigidity part of the group \u0393 to \"large\" subsets of the mysterious\ngroup \u039b. In turn, this mild form of rigidity is used through a refinement of the\ninfinitesimal analysis developed in [Pet09c] to show that the resolvent deformation\nconverges to zero, uniformly on the unit ball of the \"mysterious\" Cartan subalgebra\nL\u221e (Y ). Finally, this stronger \"rigid behavior\" of L\u221e (Y ) with respect to the the\nresolvent deformation is exploited in the same way as in [Pet09b] to completely\nlocate the position of L\u221e (Y ) inside N .\nWhile more technical, the proof of the product case follows the same general\nstrategy. The difficulty however is that if L\u221e (Y ) \u2282 L\u221e (X) \u22ca \u0393 is a group-measure\nspace Cartan subalgebra and L\u221e (Y ) \u2282 L\u221e (X) \u22ca \u03931 , then by [JP82] L\u221e (Y ) is\nalso a Cartan subalgebra of L\u221e (X) \u22ca \u03931 ; however, there is no obvious reason for\nL\u221e (Y ) to again be a group-measure space Cartan subalgebra of L\u221e (X) \u22ca \u03931 . This\ndifficulty is overcome by developing a transfer property (Lemma 4.6 below) which\nis applicable in the setting of products.\nWe do not know if the von Neumann algebras N considered in the theorem above\ndo have a unique, up to unitary conjugacy, Cartan subalgebra.\nUsing his deformation/rigidity theory, Popa discovered a natural class of OEsuperrigid actions of product groups, showing in [Pop08] the following: Given any\nproduct of nonamenable groups \u0393 = \u03931 \u00d7 \u03932 and any countable \u0393-set I such that\nfor every i \u2208 I, its \u03931 -orbit is infinite and its \u03932 -stabilizer is amenable, the corresponding generalized Bernoulli action \u0393 y (X, \u03bc)I , if free, is OE-superrigid. The\nreader may notice that even though the actions considered are somewhat particular\nthere is a large degree of generality at the level of acting groups \u0393i . Therefore, when\nletting the groups \u0393i to be in our class CR, and combining it with Theorem above\nleads to the following examples of W \u2217 -superrigid actions.\nCorollary. Consider \u0393 = \u03931 \u00d7 \u03932 where \u0393i \u2208 CR and let I be a countable \u0393-set\nsuch that for all i \u2208 I the orbit \u03931 i is infinite and the stabilizer {\u03b3 \u2208 \u03932 | \u03b3i = i}\nis amenable. Then the corresponding generalized Bernoulli action \u0393 y (X, \u03bc)I , if\nfree, is W \u2217 -superrigid.\nMonod and Shalom considered in [MS06] the class Creg of all groups with nonvanishing second bounded cohomology with coefficients in the left regular representation. In the same paper they proved, by using bounded cohomology methods,\nthat any free, irreducible, aperiodic, action of products of such groups is close to\nbeing OE-superrigid in the following sense: whenever this action is orbit equivalent\nto any other free, mildly mixing action then the two actions must be conjugated.\nFor a precise statement, as well as the definitions of mild mixing and aperiodicity,\n\n\fUNIQUE GROUP-MEASURE SPACE DECOMPOSITION\n\n5\n\nthe reader may consult Section 6 or Theorem 1.10 in [MS06]. Monod and Shalom\nproved the necessity of this condition for their statement; however it will be interesting to understand if their actions are OE-superrigid when one assumes, in\naddition, that they are mixing.\nThe class Creg is quite large (see Section 6 below or Example 1.1 in [MS06]) and\nit intersects nontrivially with our class CR. Basic examples of groups that belong to\nboth classes include all free products of a nontrivial group and an infinite property\n(T) group. For instance, if |\u0393| > 2 then we have \u0393 \u2217 SL(3, Z) \u2208 CR \u2229 Creg .\nConsequently, for such groups, Monod and Shalom's result together with our\nmain theorem imply the following W \u2217 -strong rigidity statement.\nCorollary. Let \u0393 = \u03931 \u00d7 \u03932 with \u0393i \u2208 CR \u2229 Creg for i = 1, 2, and let \u0393 y X be\na free, irreducible, aperiodic action. Suppose that \u039b y Y is mildly mixing action.\nIf the action \u0393 y X is W \u2217 -equivalent with \u039b y Y then \u0393 y X and \u039b y Y are\nconjugate.\nOrganization of the paper. This paper contains seven sections and one appendix. In the first section we review Popa's intertwining techniques and we prove a\nfew conjugacy results for actions of product groups. The first part of Section 2 collects important background on real, closable derivations along with their resolvent\ndeformations. We show in Lemma 2.6 that bimodules arising from mixing representations are mixing and, through an adaptation of technology from [Pet09c], we\nuse this to prove in Section 3 a criterion for the uniform convergence of the resolvent deformations on certain subalgebras (Theorem 3.2). In a similar fashion with\nLemma 3.2 in [PV09] we prove in Section 4 a transfer Lemma 4.6 for actions of\nproduct of groups in class CR. In turn, this transfer lemma is used in combination\nwith Theorem 3.2 to prove the unique group measure Cartan decomposition result\nin Corollary 5.3. In Section 6 we use Corollary 5.3 to derive our main applications to W \u2217 -superrigidity, Corollaries 6.1 and 6.2. In the last section we exhibit\nmore examples of von Neumann algebras with unique group measure space Cartan\nsubalgebras (Theorem 7.4).\nNotations. In this paper all finite von Neumann algebras N that we will be\nworking with are assumed to be endowed with a normal faithful tracial state, which\n1\nwe will denote by \u03c4 . The trace \u03c4 induces a norm on N by letting kxk2 = \u03c4 (x\u2217 x) 2 .\n2\nAs usual, L N denotes the k*k2 -completion of N . A Hilbert space H is a N -bimodule\nif it is equipped with commuting left and right Hilbert N -module structures.\nGiven a von Neumann subalgebra Q \u2282 N we denote by EQ : N \u2192 N the unique\n\u03c4 -preserving conditional expectation onto Q. If eQ is the orthogonal projection of\nL2 N onto L2 (Q) then hN, eQ i denotes the basic construction, i.e., the von Neumann\nalgebra generated by N and eQ in B(L2 N ). The span of {xeQ y | x, y \u2208 N } forms a\ndense \u2217-subalgebra of hN, eQ i and there exists a semifinite trace T r : hN, eQ i \u2192 C\ngiven by the formula T r(xeQ y) = \u03c4 (xy) for all x, y \u2208 N . We denote by L2 hN, EQ i\nthe Hilbert space obtained with respect to this trace.\nThe normalizer of Q inside N , denoted NN (Q), consists of all unitary elements\nu \u2208 U(N ) satisfying uQu\u2217 = Q. A maximal abelian selfadjoint subalgebra A of N ,\nabbreviated MASA, is called a Cartan subalgebra if the von Neumann algebra generated by its normalizer in N , NN (A)\u2032\u2032 is equal to N . Also, A is called semiregular\nif NN (A)\u2032\u2032 is a subfactor of N .\n\n\f6\n\nIONUT CHIFAN AND JESSE PETERSON\n\nIf \u0393 y\u03c3 A is a trace preserving action by automorphisms of a countable group \u0393\non a finite von Neumann algebra A we denote by N = A \u22ca\u03c3 \u0393 the crossed product\nvon Neumann algebra associated with the action. When no confusion will arise we\nwill drop the symbol \u03c3. Given a subset F \u2282 \u0393, we will denote by PF the orthogonal\nprojection on the closure of the span of {au\u03b3 | a \u2208 A; \u03b3 \u2208 F }.\nThroughout this paper \u03c9 denotes a free ultrafilter on N. Also given (N, \u03c4 ) a\nfinite von Neumann algebra we denote by (N \u03c9 , \u03c4 \u03c9 ) its ultrapower algebra, i.e.,\nN \u03c9 = l\u221e (N, N )/I where the trace is defined as \u03c4 \u03c9 ((xn )n ) = limn\u2192\u03c9 \u03c4 (xn ) and I\nis the ideal consisting of all x \u2208 l\u221e (N, N ) such that \u03c4 \u03c9 (x\u2217 x) = 0. Notice that N\nembeds naturally into N \u03c9 by considering constant sequences. Many times when\nworking with N = A \u22ca \u0393 we will consider the subalgebra A\u03c9 \u22ca \u0393 of N \u03c9 . For\nreader's convenience we remark that every element x = (xn )n \u2208 A\u03c9 \u22ca \u0393 satisfies\nthat inf F \u2282\u0393,finite limn\u2192\u03c9 kxn \u2212 PF (xn )k2 = 0.\nAcknowledgement. We are grateful to Stefaan Vaes for numerous useful comments and for pointing out an error in an early version of this paper.\n1. Intertwining techniques\nWe start this section by reviewing Popa's intertwining techniques from [Pop06b].\nGiven N a finite von Neumann algebra, let P \u2282 f N f , Q \u2282 N be diffuse subalgebras\nfor some projection f \u2208 N . One say that a corner of P can be embedded into Q\ninside N if there exist two nonzero projections p \u2208 P , q \u2208 Q, a nonzero partial\nisometry v \u2208 pN q, and a \u2217-homomorphism \u03c8 : pP p \u2192 qQq such that v\u03c8(x) = xv\nfor all x \u2208 pP p. Throughout this paper we denote by P \u227aN Q whenever this\nproperty holds and by P \u2280N Q otherwise.\nPopa established efficient criteria for the existence of such intertwiners (Theorems\n2.1-2.3 in [Pop06b]). Particularly useful in applications is the analytic criterion\ndescribed in Corollary 2.3 of [Pop06b]. Considering the case of crossed-products\nvon Neumann algebras, the next proposition is a reformulation of Popa's result\nusing the ultrapower algebras setting.\nProposition 1.1. Let \u0393 be a countable group, A a finite von Neumann algebra\nand \u0393 y A is a trace preserving action. Suppose that N = A \u22ca \u0393 and B \u2282 N is\na subalgebra which is either abelian or a II1 factor. If q \u2208 B \u2032 \u2229 N is a nonzero\nprojection then the following are equivalent:\n(1) Bq \u2280N A.\n(2) For any nonzero projection p \u2208 (B \u2032 \u2229N )\u03c9 with p 6 q we have B \u03c9 p * A\u03c9 \u22ca\u0393.\n(3) For any nonzero projection p \u2208 B \u2032 \u2229 N with p 6 q we have B \u03c9 p * A\u03c9 \u22ca \u0393.\nMoreover, if NN (B)\u2032 \u2229 N = C1 (for instance when B is a semiregular MASA) then\nthe following are equivalent:\n(1)\u2032 B \u227aN A.\n(2)\u2032 B \u03c9 \u2286 A\u03c9 \u22ca \u0393.\nProof. First we prove (1) \u21d2 (2). Assuming Bq \u2280N A, by Popa's intertwining result\n[Pop06b] there exists a sequence of unitaries un \u2208 U(B) such that for all x, y \u2208 N\nwe have kEA (xun qy)k2 \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e. This easily implies EA\u03c9 \u22ca\u0393 (uq) = 0, where\nu = (un )n \u2208 N \u03c9 . If p \u2208 (B \u2032 \u2229 N )\u03c9 \u2229 (A\u03c9 \u22ca \u0393) is a projection such that p 6 q, then\nEA\u03c9 \u22ca\u0393 (up) = EA\u03c9 \u22ca\u0393 (uqp) = EA\u03c9 \u22ca\u0393 (uq)p = 0 and hence B \u03c9 p * A\u03c9 \u22ca \u0393 unless\np = 0.\n\n\fUNIQUE GROUP-MEASURE SPACE DECOMPOSITION\n\n7\n\nThe implication (2) \u21d2 (3) is obvious and therefore to finish the proof it only\nremains to show (3) \u21d2 (1). We will prove this by contraposition. Assuming Bq \u227aN\nA one can find nonzero projections rq \u2208 Bq, p \u2208 A, an injective \u2217-homomorphism\n\u03c8 : rBrq \u2192 pAp and nonzero partial isometry v \u2208 rqN such that v\u03c8(x) = xv for\nall x \u2208 rBrq. The last equation implies that vv \u2217 \u2208 (rBrq)\u2032 \u2229 rqN rq and therefore\nwe have the following containment:\nrBrvv \u2217 = v\u03c8(rBr)v \u2217 \u2286 vAv \u2217 .\n\n(1)\n\nWe notice that there exists nonzero projection q \u2032 \u2208 B \u2032 \u2229 N with q \u2032 6 q such that\nvv = rq \u2032 and combining this with relation (1) we obtain that\n\u2217\n\n(rBr)\u03c9 q \u2032 \u2286 A\u03c9 \u22ca \u0393.\n\n(2)\n\nIf B is a II1 factor then by passing to a subprojection we may assume that\n\u03c4N (r) = k1 for some positive integer k. Also for every i, j \u2208 {1, ..., k} there exist\npartial isometries eij \u2208 B such that e11 = r, e\u2217ij = eji , eij eji = eii \u2208 P(B) and\nP\n\u03c9\nthen using the above relations in combination with\ni eii = 1. If (xn )n \u2208 B\n\u2032\n\u2032\nq \u2208 B \u2229 N we have that\nX\nX\n(ei1 e1i xn ej1 e1j q \u2032 )n\neii xn ejj q \u2032 )n =\n(xn )n (q \u2032 )n = (xn q \u2032 )n = (\ni,j\n\ni,j\n\n(3)\n\n=\n\nX\n\n\u2032\n\n(ei1 )n (e1i xn ej1 )n (q )n (e1j )n .\n\ni,j\n\nOne can easily see that (e1i xn ej1 )n \u2208 (rBr)\u03c9 and combining this with relations\n(2) and (3) we conclude that (xn )n (q \u2032 )n \u2208 A\u03c9 \u22ca\u0393, thus showing that B \u03c9 q \u2032 \u2286 A\u03c9 \u22ca\u0393.\nTherefore, in both cases (B abelian and B a II1 factor) we can assume that there\nexists a nonzero projection p \u2208 B \u2032 \u2229N with p 6 q such that B \u03c9 p \u2286 A\u03c9 \u22ca\u0393, finishing\nthe proof of implication (3) \u21d2 (1).\nIf B \u227aN A then by equivalence (1) \u21d4 (3) one can find a nonzero projection\np \u2208 B \u2032 \u2229 N such that B \u03c9 p \u2286 A\u03c9 \u22ca \u0393. Conjugating by u \u2208 NM (B) \u2282 NM (B \u2032 \u2229 N )\nwe obtain B \u03c9 upu\u2217 \u2286 A\u03c9 \u22ca \u0393, for all u \u2208 NM (B), hence B \u03c9 p0 \u2286 A\u03c9 \u22ca \u0393 where\np0 = \u2228u\u2208NM (B) upu\u2217 \u2208 B \u2032 \u2229 N . One easily sees that p0 commutes with NM (B) and\ntherefore it belongs to NM (B)\u2032 \u2229 N . By assumption we have NM (B)\u2032 \u2229 N = C1, we\nthen conclude that p0 = 1 and therefore B \u03c9 \u2286 A\u03c9 \u22ca\u03c3 \u0393. This shows (1)\u2032 \u21d2 (2)\u2032 and\nthe reversed implication follows immediately from the equivalence (1) \u21d4 (3).\n\u0003\nBefore stating the next intertwining result we introduce some notation. Given a\nproduct group \u0393 = \u03931 \u00d7 \u03932 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 \u0393m , for every 1 6 i 6 m, we denote by \u0393(i) the\nsubgroup of \u0393 consisting of all elements in \u0393 whose ith coordinate is trivial, so that\nwe have the natural identification \u0393 = \u0393i \u00d7 \u0393(i) for each 1 6 i 6 m.\nCorollary 1.2. Let \u0393 = \u03931 \u00d7 \u03932 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 \u0393m and let \u0393 y A be a trace preserving\naction on a finite von Neumann algebra A. Assume that B \u2286 A \u22ca \u0393 = N is a\nsubalgebra satisfying one of the following conditins:\n(1) B is a II1 factor such that Bq \u227aN A\u22ca\u0393(i) for all q \u2208 B \u2032 \u2229N and 1 6 i 6 m;\n(2) B is a semiregular MASA such that B \u227aN A \u22ca \u0393(i) for all 1 6 i 6 m.\nThen B \u227aN A.\nProof. Notice that for every 1 6 i 6 m the algebra N can be seen as (A \u22ca \u0393(i) ) \u22ca \u0393i\nwith \u0393i acting trivially on \u0393(i) . First we assume situation (1), i.e. B is a II1 factor\n\n\f8\n\nIONUT CHIFAN AND JESSE PETERSON\n\nsuch that for all q \u2208 B \u2032 \u2229 N we have Bq \u227aN A \u22ca \u0393(i) . Therefore, by Proposition\n1.1 there exists nonzero projection qi \u2208 B \u2032 \u2229 N such that\nB \u03c9 qi \u2282 (A \u22ca \u0393(i) )\u03c9 \u22ca \u0393i .\n\n(4)\n\nThen we let qi \u2208 B \u2032 \u2229N to be maximal such that B \u03c9 qi \u2282 (A\u22ca \u0393(i) )\u03c9 \u22ca \u0393i and below\nwe argue that qi = 1. Assuming the contrary, we have 0 6= 1 \u2212 qi \u2208 B \u2032 \u2229 N and\nsince by initial assumption B(1 \u2212 qi ) \u227aN A \u22ca \u0393(i) there exists a nonzero projection\npi \u2208 B \u2032 \u2229 N with pi 6 1 \u2212 qi such that\nB \u03c9 pi \u2282 (A \u22ca \u0393(i) )\u03c9 \u22ca \u0393i .\n\nCombining this with (4) we get that B \u03c9 (qi + pi ) \u2282 (A \u22ca \u0393(i) )\u03c9 \u22ca \u0393i which obviously\ncontradicts the maximality of qi .\nAltogether we obtained that for all 1 6 i 6 m we have B \u03c9 \u2282 (A \u22ca \u0393(i) )\u03c9 \u22ca \u0393i\nand hence we have\nm\n\\\n(A \u22ca \u0393(i) )\u03c9 \u22ca \u0393i .\nB\u03c9 \u2282\ni=1\n\nIf we let x = (xn )n \u2208\nthat\n\nTm\n\n\u03c9\ni=1 (A \u22ca \u0393(i) ) \u22ca \u0393i then for every 1 6 i 6 m we have\n\nlim kPFi (xn ) \u2212 xn k2 = 0.\n\ninf\n\nFi \u2282\u0393i , finite n\u2192\u03c9\n\nUsing these relations in combination with triangle inequality we obtain that\ninf\n\nlim kPF1 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 PFm (xn ) \u2212 xn k2 = 0,\n\nF1 \u00d7***\u00d7Fm \u2282\u0393, finite n\u2192\u03c9\n\nand since PF1 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 PF2 (xn ) = PF1 \u00d7***\u00d7Fm (xn ) we conclude that x \u2208 A\u03c9 \u22ca (\u03931 \u00d7\n* * * \u00d7 \u0393m ).\nTm\nHence B \u03c9 \u2282 i=1 (A \u22ca \u0393(i) )\u03c9 \u22ca \u0393i = A\u03c9 \u22ca \u0393 = A\u03c9 \u22ca \u0393 and by Proposition 1.1\nwe have that B \u227aN A.\nFor case (2) just notice that by the second part of Proposition 1.1 we have that\nB \u03c9 \u2282 (A \u22ca \u0393(i) )\u03c9 \u22ca \u0393i for all 1 6 i 6 m and therefore the conclusion follows from\nabove.\n\u0003\nWe end this section by recalling Popa's conjugacy criterion for Cartan subalgebras which will be used in the sequel.\nTheorem 1.3 (Appendix 1 in [Pop06a]).

In fact \u03b4\u0303 is nothing but the tensor\nproduct derivation \u03b4 \u2297 0 as defined in Section 4.2 of [PS09].\nAssociated to each closable, real derivation \u03b4 is the resolvent deformation given\nby\n\u03b1\n1\n(8)\n\u03c1\u03b1 =\n, \u03b6\u03b1 = (\u03c1\u03b1 ) 2 , for all \u03b1 > 0.\n\u03b1 + \u03b4\u2217\u03b4\nFrom [Sau90, Pet09b] it follows that \u03c1\u03b1 and \u03b6\u03b1 are two families of \u03c4 -symmetric,\nunital, completely positive maps on N such that for all x \u2208 N we have that kx \u2212\n\u03c1\u03b1 (x)k2 \u2192 0 and kx \u2212 \u03b6\u03b1 (x)k2 \u2192 0 as \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e.\nWe let (H\u03b1 , \u03be\u03b1 ) be the pointed N -bimodule corresponding to the map \u03b6\u03b1 (see,\nfor example, [Pop86])and define the map \u03b4\u03b1 : N \u2192 H\u03b1 \u2297N H\u03c0 \u2297N H\u03b1 by the formula\n(9)\n\n1\n\n\u03b4\u03b1 (x) = \u03b1\u2212 2 \u03be\u03b1 \u2297N (\u03b4 \u25e6 \u03b6\u03b1 )(x) \u2297N \u03be\u03b1 ,\n\nwhere \u2297N denotes Connes' fusion product of N -bimodules. After a closer examination the reader may observe that when \u03b4 is comes from a cocycle c as described\nabove then the N -bimodule H\u03b1 is nothing but H\u03c0\u03b1c , where \u03c0\u03b1c is the the represenq\n\u03b1\ntation of of \u0393 which corresponds to the positive definite function \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b1+kc(\u03b3)k\n2.\nLikewise, associated to \u03b4\u0303 are two families of \u03c4 -symmetric, unital, completely\npositive maps on N \u2297 N given by\n\u03b1\n1\n(10)\n\u03c1\u0303\u03b1 =\n= \u03c1\u03b1 \u2297 id, \u03b6\u0303\u03b1 = (\u03c1\u0303\u03b1 ) 2 = \u03b6\u03b1 \u2297 id, for all \u03b1 > 0.\n\u03b1 + \u03b4\u0303 \u2217 \u03b4\u0303\nDefine the Hilbert space H\u0303\u03c0\u03b1 = (H\u03b1 \u2297N H\u03c0 \u2297N H\u03b1 )\u2297L2 N which we endow with the\nnatural N \u2297 N -bimodule structure and consider \u03b4\u0303\u03b1 : N \u2297 N \u2192 H\u0303\u03c0\u03b1 the map given\nby the formula \u03b4\u0303\u03b1 = \u03b4\u03b1 \u2297 id.\nIn the next two propositions we summarize a few basic properties of \u03b4\u03b1 that will\nbe used extensively throughout this paper.

The same statement holds if we drop it.\nThe N -bimodules H\u03c0 coming from representations \u03c0 often inherits many useful\nproperties from \u03c0. For instance, as observed in [PS09, Pet09c], if \u03c0 is a mixing\nrepresentation, then H\u03c0 is mixing relative to A. More generally, this also holds in\nthe setting of groups that admit mixing representations with respect to subgroups.\nBelow, for reader's convenience, we include a proof of this fact. Given a group\n\u0393 with a subgroup \u03a3 < \u0393, and a representation \u03c0 : \u0393 \u2192 U(K), we say that \u03c0\nis mixing relative to \u03a3 if h\u03c0(\u03b3n )\u03be, \u03b7i \u2192 0 whenever the sequence \u03b3n escapes any\nleft-right coset of \u03a3 in \u0393.\nLemma 2.4. Let \u03a3 < \u0393 be groups and let \u03c0 : \u0393 \u2192 U(K) be a representation which\nis mixing relative to \u03a3.

A criterion for uniform convergence of resolvent deformations\nIn this section we exhibit a criterion for uniform convergence of the resolvent\ndeformations on certain subalgebras (Theorem 3.2). Roughly speaking, if the resolvent deformation arising from a derivation into a mixing bimodule is small on\n\"sufficiently large\" sets of elements normalizing a given abelian subalgebra B, then\n\u03b4\u03b1 converges uniformly on the unit ball of B. Our proof of the criterion is done in\n\n\f14\n\nIONUT CHIFAN AND JESSE PETERSON\n\ntwo steps; first, in a technical lemma (Lemma 3.1 below) we adapt the infinitesimal\nanalysis developed in [Pet09c] to show that there are infinitely many translations\nby large projections of the unit ball (B)1 on which \u03b4\u03b1 is uniformly small; then we\nuse a convexity argument to show this implies that \u03b4\u03b1 converges uniformly on the\nunit ball of B (Theorem 3.2 below).\nTo introduce the precise statements of the results we first establish the following\nnotation. Let \u03a3\u22b3\u0393 be a normal subgroup and let \u03c0 : \u0393 \u2192 U(K) be a representation\nwhich is mixing relative to \u03a3. Assume there exists an unbounded cocycle c : \u0393 \u2192 K\nwhich vanishes on \u03a3. Let \u0393 y A be a trace preserving action, denote by M = A\u22ca\u0393\nand consider \u03b4\u03b1 : M \u2192 H\u03b1 \u2297M H\u03c0 \u2297M H\u03b1 corresponding to c as above. Also, assume\nthat B \u2282 M = A \u22ca \u0393 is an abelian algebra.\nLemma 3.1. Using the above notation, assume there exist an infinite subset F \u2282\nNM (B) and a nonzero projection r \u2208 F \u2032 \u2229 M satisfying the following property:\nFor every k \u2208 N there exist \u03b1k > 0 and a sequence {vnk | n \u2208 N} \u2282 F such that\n1\nfor all \u03b1 > \u03b1k , k, n \u2208 N,\nk\nkEA\u22ca\u03a3 (xrvnk y)k2 \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e, for each k \u2208 N.\nk\u03b4\u03b1 (vnk )k2 6\n\n(26)\n(27)\n\nThen one can find a constant D > 0 such that for every s \u2208 N there exist\nrs \u2208 M with 0 < rs 6 1, and positive numbers \u03b5s , \u03b2s > 0, such that for all \u03b1 > \u03b2s\nand b \u2208 U(B), we have\nk\u03b4\u03b1 (rs b)k\n\n6\n\n\u03b5s ,\n\n\u03c4 (rrs ) > D,\n\u03b5s \u2192 0 as s \u2192 \u221e.\n\nProof.

Fix u \u2208\nNM (B), since \u03b4\u03b1 converges uniformly to zero on q(B)1 and u \u2208 NM (B) then for\nevery s \u2208 N there exists \u03b2s4 > 0 such that for all \u03b1 > \u03b2s4 and b \u2208 (B)1 we have\n(51)\n\nk\u03b4\u03b1 (p\u221e b)k\n\n1\n.\ns\nAlso, there exists \u03b2s5 > 0 such that for all \u03b1 > \u03b2s5 we have\n(52)\n\nk\u03b4\u03b1 (qu\u2217 bu)k 6\n\n1\n.\ns\nTherefore, using Proposition 2.2 in combination with (52) and (53), for every s \u2208 N,\n\u03b1 > max{\u03b2s5 , \u03b2s4 } and b \u2208 (B)1 we have the following\nk\u03b4\u03b1 (u)k\n\n(53)\n\nk\u03b4\u03b1 (uqu\u2217 b)k 6\n=\n6\n\n6\n\n1\n\nku\u03b4\u03b1 (qu\u2217 bu)u\u2217 k + 100k\u03b4\u03b1 (u)k 2\n1\n\nk\u03b4\u03b1 (qu\u2217 bu)k + 100k\u03b4\u03b1(u)k 2\n1 100\n+ 1 .\ns\ns2\n\nThis shows that \u03b4\u03b1 converges uniformly to zero on (uqu\u2217 )(B)1 and therefore \u03b4\u03b1\nconverges uniformly to zero on (uqu\u2217 + q)(B)1 . For any c > 0 denote by qc the\nspectral projection of uqu\u2217 + q corresponding to the interval [c, \u221e) and let rc be\nthe inverse of qc (uqu\u2217 + q) in qc M qc . Since \u03b4\u03b1 converges uniformly to zero on\n(uqu\u2217 + q)(B)1 then by using Proposition 2.2 again we obtain that \u03b4\u03b1 converges to\nzero uniformly on rc (uqu\u2217 + q)(B)1 = qc (B)1 . Since this holds for every c > 0 we\nconclude that \u03b4\u03b1 converges to zero uniformly on q0 (B)1 where q0 = supp(uqu\u2217 + q)\nSince supp(vuqu\u2217v \u2217 + q) = uqu\u2217 \u2228 q and since q was a maximal element of V we\nhave that q = uqu\u2217 \u2228q, or equivalently, q = uqu\u2217 . Since the above procedure can be\ndone for any u \u2208 NM (B) we have that q \u2208 NM (B)\u2032 \u2229 M and thus q \u2208 Z(NM (B)\u2032\u2032 ).\nAlso, notice that a similar argument as above shows that q is the unique maximal\nelement of V. Combining this with the first part of the proof we have that q > p\nand therefore qr 6= 0.\n\u0003\n\n\f20\n\nIONUT CHIFAN AND JESSE PETERSON\n\n4. A Transfer Lemma\nFor the transfer lemma that we cover in this section we need some preliminary\nresults on Hilbert bimodules. The following lemma is well known to the experts\nand we include a proof only for completeness.\nLemma 4.1. Suppose that B is a diffuse amenable von Neumann algebra, \u039b is a\ncountable discrete group, and \u039b y B is a trace preserving action such that N =\nB \u22ca\u039b. Let H P\nbe a Hilbert P\nN -bimodule. Let \u2206 : N \u2192 N \u2297N be the \u2217-homomorphism\ndefined by \u2206( b\u03bb v\u03bb ) =\nb\u03bb v\u03bb \u2297 v\u03bb where \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and b\u03bb \u2208 B, and consider the\nN -bimodule L2 N \u2297H where the left-right N -actions satisfy x * \u03be * y = \u2206(x)\u03be\u2206(y)\nfor all x, y \u2208 N, \u03be \u2208 L2 N \u2297H. If the N -bimodule H is weakly contained in the\ncoarse bimodule then the N -bimodule L2 N \u2297H is also weakly contained in the coarse\nbimodule.\nProof. Since, as N -bimodules, H is weakly contained in L2 N \u2297L2 N it follows that,\nas N \u2297N -bimodules, L2 N \u2297H is weakly contained in L2 N \u2297(L2 N \u2297L2 N ) and hence\nit is enough to consider the case when H = L2 N \u2297L2 N .\nIn this case if we consider an orthonormal basis {bi }i\u2208I for L2 B, and consider\nthe vectors \u03b7 = 1 \u2297 (bi vh \u2297 bj ) and \u03b6 = 1 \u2297 (bk vh\u2032 \u2297 bl ) then a routine calculation\nshows that\nhbv\u03bb * \u03b7 * b\u2032 v\u03bb\u2032 , \u03b6i = \u03b4\u03bb,e \u03b4\u03bb\u2032 ,e \u03b4j,l \u03b4h,h\u2032 \u03b4i,k \u03c4 (bb\u2032 ) = \u03c4 (EB (bv\u03bb )b\u2032 v\u03bb\u2032 )\n\nThis then establishes a Hilbert N -bimodule isomorphism between L2 N \u2297(L2 N \u2297L2 N )\nand L2 hN, eB i\u2295\u221e . Since B is amenable the previous bimodule is weakly contained\nin the coarse bimodule.\n\u0003\nFor the rest of this section we will use the following notation.\nNotation. For 1 6 i 6 2 let \u0393i \u2208 CR and let \u03a9i \u2282 \u0393i be an i.c.c. subgroup with\nrelative property (T). Denote by \u0393 = \u03931 \u00d7 \u03932 and \u03a9 = \u03a91 \u00d7 \u03a92 and assume that\n\u0393 y A is a trace preserving action on an abelian von Neumann algebra A such that\nN = A\u22ca\u0393 is a factor. Suppose that B is an abelian algebra, \u039b is an i.c.c. group and\n\u039b y\u03c1 B a free action such that N = A \u22ca \u0393 = B \u22ca\u03c1 \u039b. Let \u2206 : N \u2192 N \u2297N be the \u2217homomorphism from the previous lemma defined by \u2206(\u03a3\u03bb\u2208\u039b b\u03bb v\u03bb ) = \u03a3\u03bb\u2208\u039b b\u03bb v\u03bb \u2297v\u03bb\nfor \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, and b\u03bb \u2208 B. Also, as in Section 1, for every i we denote by \u0393(i) the\nsubgroup of \u0393 consisting of all elements in \u0393 whose ith coordinate is trivial.\nSince \u0393i \u2208 CR for all 1 6 i 6 2 there exists a corresponding unbounded cocycle\ninto a mixing representation which is weakly contained in the left-regular representation. As explained in Section 2, associated to such a cocycle is a closable\nreal derivation \u03b4 i : N \u2192 Hi , such that the N -bimodule Hi is mixing relative to\nA \u22ca \u0393(i) , and such that \u03b4\u03b1i does not converge uniformly on (N )1 . Also, we denote\nby \u03b4\u0302 i = 0 \u2297 \u03b4 i : N \u2297N \u2192 L2 N \u2297Hi the tensor product derivation as described in\nSection 2.\nNext we show two non-intertwining lemmas which will be very important in\nestablishing the main result of this section.\nLemma 4.2.

We will proceed by contradiction. So assume there exits 1 6 i 6 2 and\nqi \u2208 \u2206(L\u03a9i )\u2032 \u2229 (N \u2297N ) such that \u2206(L\u03a9i )qi \u227aN \u2297N N \u2297A.

Using the notation above, let 1 6 j 6 2 and p \u2208 \u2206(L\u03a9)\u2032 \u2229 (N \u2297N )\na nonzero projection such that \u2206(L\u03a9)\u03c9 p \u2282 (N \u2297(A \u22ca \u0393j ))\u03c9 \u22ca \u0393(j) . Then for every\n1 6 k 6 2 we have \u2206(L\u03a9k )p \u2280N \u2297N N \u2297(A \u22ca \u0393(j) ); in particular \u2206(L\u03a9)p \u2280N \u2297N\nN \u2297(A \u22ca \u0393(j) ).\nProof.

By proof of Corollary 1.2, to get our conclusion it suffices to prove that for\nevery q \u2208 (N \u2297L\u039b)\u2032 \u2229(N \u2297N ) = Z(N \u2297L\u039b) we have (N \u2297L\u039b)q \u227aN \u2297N N \u2297(A\u22ca\u0393(j) ).\nTo show this we proceed by contradiction so assume that there exists qo \u2208\nZ(N \u2297L\u039b) such that (N \u2297L\u039b)qo \u2280N \u2297N N \u2297(A \u22ca \u0393(j) ). Also since \u03b4\u0302\u03b1j converges\nto zero uniformly on (N \u2297L\u039b)1 then applying Corollary 2.3 in [Pop06b], for every\nk \u2208 N there exists \u03b1k > 0 and an infinite sequence of elements {ukn | n \u2208 N} \u2282\nU(N \u2297L\u039b) such that\n(1) k\u03b4\u0302\u03b1j (ukn )k 6 k1 for all \u03b1 > \u03b1k ;\n(2) kEN \u2297(A\u22ca\u0393(j) ) (xukn qo y)k2 \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e for all x, y \u2208 N \u2297N.\n\nThen applying Theorem 3.2 for \u0393 = \u0393j , \u03a3 trivial, M = N \u2297N = (N \u2297(A \u22ca \u0393(j) )) \u22ca\n\u0393j , B = 1\u2297B, and r = qo we obtain that \u03b4\u0302\u03b1j converges to zero uniformly on\n(1\u2297B)1 . Applying Proposition 2.2 we obtain that \u03b4\u0302\u03b1j converges to zero uniformly on\n(U(1\u2297B)U(N \u2297L\u039b)) and hence on (N \u2297N )1 which is obviously a contradiction. \u0003\nLemma 4.5.

This however would\ncontradict Lemma 4.2. Hence we can assume without loss of generality that p1 6= 1,\nor equivalently, 0 < 1 \u2212 p1 .\nNext, we proceed by contradiction to show that \u2206(L\u03a9)(1 \u2212 p1 ) \u2280N \u2297N N \u2297(A \u22ca\n\u03931 ). So assume that \u2206(L\u03a9)(1 \u2212 p1 ) \u227aN \u2297N N \u2297(A \u22ca \u03931 ) and by Proposition 1.1\nthere exists a non-zero projection r1 \u2208 \u2206(L\u03a9)\u2032 \u2229 N \u2297N with r1 6 1 \u2212 p1 such that\n\u2206(L\u03a9)\u03c9 r1 \u2282 (N \u2297(A \u22ca \u03931 ))\u03c9 \u22ca \u03932 .\n\nSince the pair (\u0393, \u03a9) has relative property (T) then the inclusion \u2206(L\u03a9) \u2282\nN \u2297N is rigid and therefore \u03b4\u0302\u03b11 converge uniformly to zero on (\u2206(L\u03a9))1 . Also by\nLemma 4.3 we have that \u2206(L\u03a9)r1 \u2280N \u2297N N \u2297(A \u22ca \u03932 ) and applying Corollary 2.3\nin [Pop06b], for every k \u2208 N there exists \u03b1k > 0 and an infinite sequence of elements\n{\u03bbkn |n \u2208 N} \u2282 \u03a9 such that\n(1) k\u03b4\u0302\u03b11 (\u2206(u\u03bbkn ))k 6 k1 for all \u03b1 > \u03b1k ;\n(2) kEN \u2297(A\u22ca\u03932 ) (x\u2206(u\u03bbkn )r1 y)k2 \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e for all x, y \u2208 N \u2297N.\n\nThen applying Theorem 3.2 for \u0393 = \u03931 , \u03a3 trivial, M = N \u2297N = (N \u2297(A\u22ca\u03932 ))\u22ca\u03931 ,\nB = \u2206(A), and r = r1 there exists a nonzero projection q1 \u2208 Z(NN \u2297N (\u2206(A))\u2032\u2032 )\nwith r1 q1 6= 0 such that \u03b4\u0302\u03b11 converges to zero uniformly on q1 (\u2206(A))1 .\nNext, we claim that \u03b4\u0302\u03b11 converges to zero uniformly on r1 (\u2206(L\u0393j ))1 for every\n1 6 j 6 2. For the proof just notice that since the pair (\u0393j , \u03a9j ) has relative property\n(T) the inclusion (\u2206(L\u03a9j ) \u2282 N \u2297N ) is rigid and \u03b4\u0302\u03b11 converges uniformly to zero\non (\u2206(L\u03a9j ))1 . Also, by Lemma 4.3 for all 1 6 j 6 2 we have \u2206(L\u03a9j )r1 \u2280N \u2297N\nN \u2297(A \u22ca \u03932 ) and therefore the conclusion follows from Theorem 2.5.\nMoreover, applying the same maximality argument as in the proof of Theorem\n3.2, one can find a projection r\u2032 \u2208 Z(\u2206(L\u0393)\u2032 \u2229 N \u2297N ) with r\u2032 q1 6= 0 such that \u03b4\u0302\u03b11\nconverges to zero uniformly on r\u2032 (\u2206(L\u0393j ))1 for every 1 6 j 6 2. Since r\u2032 commutes\nwith \u2206(L\u0393j ) for every 1 6 j 6 2, using Proposition 2.2 we obtain that \u03b4\u0302\u03b1i converges\nto zero uniformly on r\u2032 (U(\u2206(L\u03931 )U(\u2206(L\u03932 )) and therefore on r\u2032 ((\u2206(L\u0393))1 .\nSince \u03b4\u0302\u03b11 converges uniformly to zero on q(\u2206(A))1 and r\u2032 commutes with q1 then\napplying Proposition 2.2 one more time we obtain that \u03b4\u0302\u03b11 converges uniformly on\nr\u2032 q1 (U(\u2206(L\u0393))U(\u2206(A))) and hence on r\u2032 q1 (\u2206(N ))1 .\nAlso, by definition, we have that \u03b4\u0302\u03b11 converges uniformly to zero on (N \u22971)1\nand therefore by Proposition 2.2 we conclude that \u03b4\u0302\u03b11 converges to zero uniformly\non r\u2032 q1 (N \u2297L\u039b)1 . Since r\u2032 6 1 \u2212 p1 we have that 0 < r\u2032 q1 6 1 \u2212 p1 . Applying\nthe same maximality argument from the proof of Theorem 3.2 one can find a projection r\u2032\u2032 \u2208 (N \u2297L\u039b)\u2032 \u2229 N \u2297N with r\u2032\u2032 6 1 \u2212 p1 such that \u03b4\u0302\u03b11 converges to zero\nuniformly on r\u2032\u2032 (N \u2297L\u039b)1 . Altogether this gives that \u03b4\u0302\u03b11 converges to zero uniformly\non (p1 + r\u2032\u2032 )(N \u2297L\u039b)1 which contradicts the maximality of p1 . Therefore we have\nthat \u2206(L\u03a9)(1 \u2212 p1 ) \u2280N \u2297N N \u2297(A \u22ca \u03931 ).\nNotice that by Proposition 1.1 this implies that (\u2206(L\u03a9))\u03c9 (1 \u2212 p1 ) * (N \u2297(A \u22ca\n\u03931 ))\u03c9 \u22ca \u03932 and hence (N \u2297L\u039b)\u03c9 * (N \u2297(A \u22ca \u03931 ))\u03c9 \u22ca \u03932 . By Proposition 4.4\nthis further implies that \u03b4\u0302\u03b12 does not converge to zero uniformly on (N \u2297L\u039b)1 and\nhence p2 6= 1. Proceeding as above we then have that \u2206(L\u03a9)(1 \u2212 p2 ) \u2280N \u2297N\nN \u2297(A \u22ca \u03932 ).\n\u0003\nThese results on Hilbert bimodules and intertwining are used to prove a \"transfer lemma\" \u00e1 la Popa-Vaes (Lemma 3.2 in [PV09]) that will be of essential use in\n\n\fUNIQUE GROUP-MEASURE SPACE DECOMPOSITION\n\n23\n\nthe proof of this paper's main result. Roughly speaking, the lemma states that the\npresence of a rigid part on the source group can be transferred, at the level of resolvent deformations, to \"large\" subsets of the target group.

Fix 1 6 j 6 2 and k \u2208 N > 0. Since the pair (\u0393, \u03a9) has relative property\n(T) then we also have that the inclusion (L\u03a9 \u2282 L\u0393) is rigid, and hence so is the\ninclusion (\u2206(L\u03a9) \u2282 N \u2297N ).\nSince (\u2206(L\u03a9) \u2282 N \u2297N ) is rigid there exists \u03b1k > 0 such that for all \u03b1 > \u03b1k we\nhave\n1\n(56)\nk\u03b4\u0302\u03b1i \u25e6 \u2206(x)k 6 \u221a , for all x \u2208 (L\u03a9)1 and 1 6 i 6 2.\nk 8\nP\nFix w \u2208 L\u03a9 a unitary and let w =\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b w\u03bb v\u03bb with w\u03bb \u2208 B be its Fourier\nexpansion in B \u22ca \u039b = N .

Uniqueness of group measure space Cartan subalgebras\nIn this section we use the above transfer lemmas in combination with the criterion for uniform convergence of the resolvent deformations to prove unique groupmeasure space Cartan results. More precisely, our main result shows that any free,\nergodic action of any product groups belonging to CR gives rise to a von Neumann\nalgebra with a unique group measure space Cartan subalgebra.\nExploiting techniques from [Pet09c] we prove first the following key intertwining\nresult.\nTheorem 5.1. Let \u03931 , \u03932 \u2208 CR, \u0393 = \u03931 \u00d7 \u03932 and let \u0393 y A a trace preserving\naction on an abelian von Neumann algebra A. If we assume that B is an abelian\nvon Neumann algebra and \u039b y B a free, action such that N = A \u22ca \u0393 = B \u22ca \u039b then\nwe have B \u227aN A.\nProof. Fixing 1 6 i 6 2 notice that the algebra N can be seen as (A \u22ca \u0393(i) ) \u22ca \u0393i\nwith \u0393i acting trivially on \u0393(i) . Therefore applying the transfer Lemma 4.6 together\nwith Theorem 3.2 (for \u03a3 = {e}) we have that \u03b4\u03b1i converges to zero uniformly on\n(B)1 . Next, we proceed by contradiction to show that B \u227aN A \u22ca \u0393(i) . Assuming\nB \u2280N A \u22ca \u0393(i) , by Popa's intertwining techniques (see Corollary 2.3. in [Pop06b])\nthere exists a sequence of unitaries bn \u2208 U(B) such that kEA\u22ca\u0393(i) (xbn y)k2 \u2192 0 as\nn \u2192 \u221e. Since \u0393i \u2208 CR and \u03b4\u03b1i converges uniformly to zero on (B)1 , Theorem 2.5\nimplies that \u03b4\u03b1i converges to zero uniformly on the unit ball of NM (B)\u2032\u2032 = N which\nis obviously a contradiction. Hence for all 1 6 i 6 2 we have that B \u227aN A\u22ca\u0393(i) and\nsince B is a Cartan subalgebra of N then Corollary 1.2 implies that B \u227aN A. \u0003\nAn immediate consequence of the previous theorem is the following:\nCorollary 5.2. If \u03931 , \u03932 \u2208 CR and \u0393 = \u03931 \u00d7 \u03932 then the group von Neumann\nalgebra L\u0393 cannot be decomposed as a crossed product L\u0393 = B \u22ca \u039b, where \u039b y B\nis a free action on a diffuse, abelian von Neumann algebra B.\nProof. If we assume that L\u0393 = B \u22ca \u039b then applying the previous result for A = C1\nwe would have B \u227aN C1 which is obviously a contradiction because B is diffuse. \u0003\nTheorem 5.1 can also be used to obtain von Neumann algebras with unique\ngroup measure space Cartan subalgebra.\nCorollary 5.3. Let \u03931 , \u03932 \u2208 CR, \u0393 = \u03931 \u00d7 \u03932 and let \u0393 y X be a free measure\npreserving action on a standard probability space. If there exists \u039b y Y a free\n\n\fUNIQUE GROUP-MEASURE SPACE DECOMPOSITION\n\n25\n\nmeasure preserving action on a standard probability space such that N = L\u221e (X) \u22ca\n\u0393 = L\u221e (Y ) \u22ca \u039b then one can find a unitary u \u2208 N such that we have uL\u221e (Y )u\u2217 =\nL\u221e (X).\nProof. By Theorem 5.1 we have L\u221e (Y ) \u227aN L\u221e (X). Popa's conjugacy criterion\n(Theorem 1.3) for Cartan subalgebras then gives the desired conclusion.\n\u0003\n6. W \u2217 -superrigidity applications\nIn this section we use the technical results from previous section to manufacture\nnew examples of W \u2217 -superrigid actions. By definition, an action \u0393 y X is called\nW \u2217 -superrigid if, for every free, p.m.p. action \u039b y Y , an isomorphism between\nthe crossed products von Neumann algebras L\u221e (X) \u22ca \u0393 and L\u221e (Y ) \u22ca \u039b entails\nconjugacy of the actions \u0393 y X and \u039b y Y .\nAs explained in the introduction, the strategy to produce such actions is to\nfind OE-superrigid actions that give rise to von Neumann algebras with unique\ngroup measure space Cartan subalgebras. Using his influential deformation/rigidity\ntheory, Popa discovered the following class of OE-superrigid actions of product\ngroups.\nTheorem (Corollary 1.3 in [Pop08]). For i = 1, 2, let \u0393i be nonamenable groups\nsuch that \u0393 = \u03931 \u00d7 \u03932 has no normal finite subgroup and let \u0393 y\u03c3 X be a free,\np.m.p. s-malleable action (see [Pop07] for the definition of an s-malleable action). If\nwe assume that the restriction \u03931 y\u03c3|\u03931 (X, \u03bc) is weak mixing and \u03932 y\u03c3|\u03932 (X, \u03bc)\nhas stable spectral gap then \u0393 y\u03c3 X is OE-superrigid.\nWhen this result is combined with Corollary 5.3 we obtain the following W \u2217 superrigidity statement:\nCorollary 6.1. Let \u03931 , \u03932 \u2208 CR such that \u0393 = \u03931 \u00d7 \u03932 has no normal finite\nsubgroup and let \u0393 y\u03c3 X be a free, p.m.p. s-malleable action. If we assume that\nthe restricted action \u03931 y\u03c3|\u03931 (X, \u03bc) is weak mixing and \u03932 y\u03c3|\u03932 (X, \u03bc) has stable\nspectral gap then the action \u0393 y\u03c3 X is W \u2217 -superrigid.\nWe mention the following concrete examples of W \u2217 -superrigid actions arising\nfrom generalized Bernoulli actions. Consider \u0393 = \u03931 \u00d7 \u03932 where \u0393i \u2208 CR and \u0393 has\nno normal finite subgroups, let I be a countable, faithful \u0393-set such that for all i \u2208 I\nthe orbit (\u03931 )i is infinite and the stabilizer {\u03b3 \u2208 \u03932 |\u03b3i = i} is amenable. From the\nproof of Lemma 3.3 in [Pop08] the generalized Bernoulli action \u0393 y (T, \u03bb)I satisfies\nthe conditions in the hypothesis of the previous corollary and thus it follows W \u2217 superrigid.\nMonod and Shalom unveiled in [MS06] a family of actions of certain product\ngroups that are very close to being OE-superrigid (See also Theorem 44 in [Sak09]\nfor additional examples). For a better understanding of their result we need to\nintroduce some terminology.\nAn action \u0393 y (X, \u03bc) is called mildly mixing if whenever A \u2286 X and \u03b3n \u2208 \u0393\nthen \u03bc(\u03b3n A\u25b3A) \u2192 0 as \u03b3n \u2192 \u221e only when A is either null or conull. It is not hard\nto see that mixing implies mildly mixing, which in turn implies weak mixing. Also\nan action \u0393 y X is called aperiodic if its restriction to any finite index subgroup\nof \u0393 is ergodic.\nFollowing the notations in [MS06], one says that a group \u0393 belongs to Creg if it\nhas nonvanishing second bounded cohomology with coefficients in the left regular\n\n\f26\n\nIONUT CHIFAN AND JESSE PETERSON\n\nrepresentation, i.e., Hb2 (\u0393, l2 (\u0393)) 6= 0. The class Creg is fairly rich, including all\ngroups which admit a non-elementary nonsimplicial action on a simplicial tree,\nwhich is proper on the set of edges; and all groups which admit a non-elementary\nproper isometric action on some CAT(-1)-space (see [MS06] for more examples).\nIn particular, any non-elementary, amalgamated free product \u03931 \u2217\u03a9 \u03932 belongs to\nCreg if one assumes that the subgroup \u03a9 is almost malnormal in one of the factors\n(Corollary 7.10 in [MS04]).\nUsing second bounded cohomology methods, Monod and Shalom proved the\nfollowing OE-strong rigidity result:\nTheorem (Theorem 1.10 in [MS06]). Let \u0393 = \u03931 \u00d7 \u03932 where \u0393i \u2208 Creg and let\n\u0393 y X be a free, irreducible, aperiodic action. Suppose that \u039b y Y is mildly\nmixing action. If the action \u0393 y X is orbit equivalent with \u039b y Y then the two\nactions are conjugate.\nConsequently, when this theorem is combined with Corollary 5.3 above, we obtain the following W \u2217 -strong rigidity result:\nCorollary 6.2. Let \u0393 = \u03931 \u00d7 \u03932 with \u0393i \u2208 CR \u2229 Creg and let \u0393 y X be a free,\nirreducible, aperiodic action. Suppose that \u039b y Y is mildly mixing action. If the\naction \u0393 y X is W \u2217 -equivalent with \u039b y Y then the two actions are conjugate.\nEven though it is clear that the classes Creg and CR do not coincide there is still\na considerable overlap between them. Indeed, combining the examples discussed\nabove with the examples presented in the introduction, the intersection CR \u2229 Creg\ncontains all non-elementary amalgamated free products \u03931 \u2217\u03a9 \u03932 which satisfy the\nfollowing three properties:\n\u2022 \u0393i are infinite groups and the common subgroup \u03a9 is almost malnormal in\none of the factors;\n\u2022 \u03931 contains an infinite subgroup which has property (T);\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\n1\n> \u03b21 (\u03a9).\n\u2022 \u03b21 (\u03931 ) + \u03b21 (\u03932 ) + |\u03a9|\n\nIn particular, if \u03931 is an infinite group with property (T), then any non-elementary\nfree product \u03931 \u2217 \u03932 belongs to the class CR \u2229 Creg .\n7. Other unique group-measure space decomposition results\n\nIn this section we will consider a class of groups larger than CR by not requiring\ncocycles to be in mixing representations but rather in representations which are\nmixing relative to an amenable subgroup. Given a group \u0393 with a subgroup \u03a3 < \u0393,\nand a representation \u03c0 : \u0393 \u2192 U(H), we say that \u03c0 is mixing relative to \u03a3 if\nh\u03c0(\u03b3n )\u03be, \u03b7i \u2192 0 whenever \u03b3n \u2192 \u221e relative to \u03a3. One says that a group \u0393 belongs\nto ACR if it satisfies either condition (1) or (2) below:\n(1) (a) There exists an amenable normal subgroup \u03a3 \u22b3 \u0393 and a representation\n\u03c0 : \u0393 \u2192 U(H) which is mixing relative to \u03a3; There exists an unbounded\ncocycle c : \u0393 \u2192 H which vanishes on \u03a3;\n(b) There exists a non-amenable subgroup \u03a9 < \u0393 such that the pair (\u0393, \u03a9)\nhas relative property (T).\n(2) (a) There exists an amenable normal subgroup \u03a3 \u22b3 \u0393 and a representation\n\u03c0 : \u0393 \u2192 U(H) which is mixing relative to \u03a3 and weakly contained in\nthe left regular; There exists an unbounded cocycle c : \u0393 \u2192 H which\nvanishes on \u03a3;\n\n\fUNIQUE GROUP-MEASURE SPACE DECOMPOSITION\n\n27\n\n(b) There exists a non-amenable subgroup \u03a9 < \u0393 which is a product of\ntwo nonamenable groups.\nNotice that any nonamenable group with positive first l2 -Betti number admits\nan unbounded cocycle into the left regular representation. Therefore ACR contains\nevery group \u0393 with first positive l2 -Betti number that admits a nonamenable subgroup \u03a9 of \u0393, such that the pair (\u0393, \u03a9) has relative property (T) or \u03a9 is a product\nof two nonamenable groups.\nNatural classes of groups in ACR have already been considered in [PV09] and\n[FV10].\nExample 7.1. If \u03931 , \u03932 are two groups which contain a common finite subgroup \u03a3,\nand \u0393 = \u03931 \u2217\u03a3 \u03932 then we may consider the cocycle c : \u0393 \u2192 l2 (\u0393/\u03a3) which satisfies\nc(\u03b31 ) = \u03b4\u03a3 \u2212 \u03bb(\u03b31 )\u03b4\u03a3 for \u03b31 \u2208 \u03931 and c(\u03b32 ) = 0 for \u03b32 \u2208 \u03932 . By the universal\nproperty of amalgamated free products this cocycle extends to all of \u0393 and will be\nunbounded as long as \u03a3 6= \u03931 , \u03932 (if \u03b3i \u2208 \u0393i \\ \u03a3, then it is easy to see that c is\nunbounded on {(\u03b31 \u03b32 )n | n \u2208 N}).\nThis shows that \u0393 satisfies condition (1a) or (2a) above. Finding examples of\nthis type which also satisfy (1b) or (2b) is not difficult and we refer the reader to\n[PV09] for examples.\nExample 7.2. Suppose H is a group which contains a finite subgroup \u03a3, and\n\u03b8 : \u03a3 \u2192 H is an injective homomorphism. Let \u0393 = HNN(H, \u03a3, \u03b8) = hH, t | \u03b8(\u03c3) =\nt\u03c3t\u22121 , for all \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3i denote the HNN extension then consider the cocycle c : \u0393 \u2192\nl2 (\u0393/\u03a3) given by c(h) = 0, for all h \u2208 H, and c(t) = \u03bb(t)\u03b4\u03a3 . We leave it as an\nexercise to show that it extends to a well defined cocycle on \u0393, and we have that\nkc(tn )k2 = |n| for all n \u2208 Z, hence c is unbounded. In fact, for this example and\nthe previous one, the cocycle we consider is well known, and arrises naturally from\nthe action of \u0393 on its Bass-Serre tree.\nThen we have that \u0393 satisfies condition (1a) or (2a) above. Again, finding\nexamples of this type which also satisfy (1b) or (2b) is not difficult and we refer\nthe reader to [PV09] for examples.\nThe main theorem we prove in this section is an intertwining result (Theorem 7.4\nbelow) for trace preserving actions of groups in class ACR on amenable algebras.\nAs a consequence we obtain new von Neumann algebras with unique group measure\nspace Cartan subalgebras.\nOur proof follows the same general strategy used to prove Theorem 5.1 above\nand it will be rather sketchy. First, by similar arguments as in the proof of Lemma\n4.6 and Lemma 3.1 in [PV09], we show that a transfer lemma still holds for von\nNeumann algebras associated with actions of groups belonging to ACR.\nLemma 7.3. Let \u0393 \u2208 ACR and let \u0393 y A be a trace preserving action on an\namenable von Neumann algebra. Suppose also that B is an abelian von Neumann\nalgebra and \u039b y B a free, ergodic action such that N = A \u22ca \u0393 = B \u22ca \u039b. If P \u2282 N\nis any amenable von Neumann subalgebra then for every \u03b5 > 0, there exists \u03b1\u03b5 > 0,\nand an infinite set of elements S \u2282 \u039b, such that\n(59)\n(60)\n\nk\u03b4\u03b1 (v\u03bb )k\n\nkEP (xv\u03bb y)k2\n\n6 \u03b5 for all \u03bb \u2208 S, \u03b1 > \u03b1\u03b5\n\n\u2192 0 for all x, y \u2208 N as \u03bb \u2192 \u221e.\n\n\f28\n\nIONUT CHIFAN AND JESSE PETERSON\n\nProof. Fix \u03b5 > 0. Borrowing the same notations from the proof of Lemma 4.6 we\nbriefly argue that in both cases there exists \u03b1\u03b5 > 0 such that for all \u03b1 > \u03b1\u03b5 we have\n\u03b5\n(61)\nk\u03b4\u0302\u03b1 \u25e6 \u2206(x)k 6 , for all x \u2208 (L\u03a9)1 .\n2\nWhen the pair (\u0393, \u03a9) has relative property (T), this follows from the proof of\nLemma 4.6, so it only remains to prove it when \u03a9 is a product of nonamenable\ngroups. This case however follows by referencing the same proof from Theorem 4.3\nin [Pet09b] and using Lemma 4.1. We leave the details\nto the reader.\nP\nNext we fix w \u2208 L\u03a9 a unitary and let w =\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b w\u03bb v\u03bb with w\u03bb \u2208 B be its\nFourier expansion in B \u22ca \u039b = N . If we denote by S = {\u03bb \u2208 \u039b | k\u03b4\u03b1 (v\u03bb )k2 6 \u03b5},\nthen using (61) in the same manner as in the proof of Lemma 4.6 we obtain that\nfor all w \u2208 U(L\u03a9) we have\nX\n3\n(62)\nkw\u03bb k22 > .\n4\n\u03bb\u2208S\n\nSo to finish the proof it only remains to check (60) for the set S. However this\nfollows from using relation (62) above exactly as shown in the last part in the proof\nof Lemma 3.2 in [PV09].\n\u0003\nPairing the above transfer lemma with the criterion for uniform convergence of\nthe resolvent deformation described in Section 3 we obtain the following:\nTheorem 7.4. Suppose \u0393 \u2208 ACR, A is an abelian von Neumann algebra and\n\u0393 y A is a free, ergodic action. If B is an abelian von Neumann algebra and\n\u039b y B is a free action such that N = A \u22ca \u0393 = B \u22ca \u039b then B \u227aN A \u22ca \u03a3. Moreover\nif \u03a3 = {e} there exists a unitary u \u2208 U(N ) such that uBu\u2217 = A.\nProof. Since \u03a3 is amenable it follows that the von Neumann algebra A \u22ca \u03a3 is also\namenable. Applying Lemma 7.3 for P = A\u22ca \u03a3 we obtain that for every k \u2208 N there\nexists \u03b1k > 0 and an infinite sequence {v\u03bbkn | n \u2208 N} \u2282 \u039b satisfying the following:\n1\nfor all \u03b1 > \u03b1k , k, n \u2208 N;\nk\nkEA\u22ca\u03a3 (xv\u03bbkn y)k2 \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e, for each k \u2208 N.\nk\u03b4\u03b1 (v\u03bbkn )k 6\n\nSince \u0393 \u2208 ACR then it admits an unbounded 1-cocycle into a representation\nwhich is mixing relative to \u03a3 and hence Theorem 3.2 implies that \u03b4\u03b1 converges\nuniformly on (B)1 .\nNext we proceed by contradiction to show B \u227aN A \u22ca \u03a3. Assuming B \u2280N A \u22ca \u03a3,\nby Popa's intertwining techniques [Pop06b], there exists a sequence of unitaries\nbn \u2208 U(B) such that kEA (xbn y)k2 \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e. Therefore Theorem 4.3 in\n[Pet09b] implies that \u03b4\u03b1 converges to zero uniformly on the unit ball of NN (B)\u2032\u2032 = N\nwhich is obviously a contradiction.\nWhen \u03a3 = {e} we have B \u227aN A and by Theorem 1.3 there exists a unitary\nu \u2208 U(N ) such that uBu\u2217 = A.\n\u0003\nRemark 7.5. If one can remove the normality assumption on the subgroup \u03a3 < \u0393\nin the proof of Lemma 2.6 then the previous intertwining result holds for any \u03a3 and\ntherefore will allow one to completely recover the W \u2217 -superrigidity results obtained\nin [PV09, FV10].\n\n\fUNIQUE GROUP-MEASURE SPACE DECOMPOSITION\n\n29\n\nRemark 7.6. Taking \u03a3 = {e} in the previous theorem we have that any free,\nergodic action on a probability space \u0393 y X of a group \u0393 with positive first l2 Betti number that admit a nonamenable subgroup \u03a9 < \u0393 with relative property\n(T), gives rise to a von Neumann algebra with unique group measure space Cartan\nsubalgebra. This result may be interpreted as a positive evidence supporting the\nfollowing general conjecture of Ioana, Popa and the authors:\nConjecture 7.7. Any free, ergodic action on a probability space \u0393 y X of any\ngroup \u0393 with positive first l2 -Betti number gives rise to a von Neumann algebra\nwith unique Cartan subalgebra.\nEven though a positive answer to this conjecture in its full generality is still\nout of reach there are instances when it is known to be true. All known examples\nhowever assume some strong conditions on either the group or the action mostly\nto insure that, besides strong deformability, the von Neumann algebra L\u221e (X) \u22ca \u0393\nalso possesses a strong pole of rigidity. To enumerate a few examples:\n\u2022 Any profinite action \u0393 y X where \u0393 is a nonamenable free group [OP07,\nOP10] or more generally any group with positive first l2 -Betti number that\nhas the completely metric approximation property [Dab10, Sin10]. In this\ncase rigidity arises from the complete metric approximation property and\nprofiniteness of the action;\n\u2022 Any profinite action \u0393 y X where \u0393 is a group that admits an unbounded\n1-cocycle into a mixing representation and does not have the Haagerup\nproperty [Pet09c]. Here rigidity arises as a mix between profiniteness of\nthe action and the absence of Haagerup property for \u0393;\n\u2022 Any action \u0393 y X where \u0393 is any free product of a nontrivial group and\neither an infinite property (T) group or a product of two nonamenable\ngroups [PV09, FV10]. Obviously in this case rigidity is inherited from the\nacting group \u0393.\nNote that our result is mostly in the spirit of the second and third situation above.\nIt will be very interesting to investigate if the conjecture is true in cases where\napriori there is a lack of rigidity, for instance for any free, ergodic action of a\nnonamenable free group.\nAppendix A. On Popa's unique HT Cartan subalgebra Theorem\nWe end by mentioning that much of the difficulty in the previous theorems was to\nobtain uniform convergence of a deformation on the \"mystery\" Cartan subalgebra.\nIf we assume that we already have convergence (for instance if we assume the\ninclusion (B \u2282 N ) is rigid) then much of the difficulty diminishes. In this setting we\ncan weaken our assumptions on the group \u0393 and in this way obtain a generalization\nof Popa's unique HT Cartan subalgebra theorem (Theorem 6.2 in [Pop06a]). This\nresult was previously presented by the second author at the Workshop on von\nNeumann Algebras and Ergodic Theory held at UCLA in 2007.\nTheorem A.1. Let \u0393 be a group such that there exists an unbounded cocycle into a\nmixing representation. Suppose A is an abelian von Neumann algebra, and \u0393 y A\nis a free, ergodic action. Let N = A \u22ca \u0393 and suppose that (B0 \u2282 N ) is a rigid\ninclusion such that B = B0\u2032 \u2229 N is a Cartan subalgebra. Then there exists a unitary\nu \u2208 U(N ) such that uBu\u2217 = A.\n\n\f30\n\nIONUT CHIFAN AND JESSE PETERSON\n\nProof. Let \u03b4 : N \u2192 H be the corresponding derivation associated to \u0393. Since \u03b4\u03b1\nconverges uniformly on B0 , if B0 6\u227aN A then using Lemma 2.4 together with Popa's\nintertwining theorem [Pop06b] and the proof of Theorem 4.5 in [Pet09b] we have\nthat \u03b4\u03b1 converges uniformly on (B)1 \u2282 (NN (B0 )\u2032\u2032 )1 . The same argument then\nimplies that \u03b4\u03b1 converges uniformly on (N )1 = (NN (B)\u2032\u2032 )1 which would contradict\nthe original cocycle being unbounded.\nThus B0 \u227aN A and hence by Popa's conjugacy criterion for Cartan subalgebras\nwe obtain the result.\n\u0003\nRemark A.2. By [AW81] if a group \u0393 has the Haagerup property then there\nexists a proper cocycle into a mixing representation and so the previous result\napplies when \u0393 has the Haagerup property as in Theorem 6.2 in [Pop06a].\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nCorollary A.3. Let \u0393 be a group such that \u03b21 (\u0393) > 0, and suppose 0 < \u03b2n (\u0393) <\n\u221e for some n \u2208 N. Then there exists a free ergodic action \u0393 y A such that\nF (A \u22ca \u0393) = {1}.\nProof. By the results in [Eps07], [GL09], [Ioa07], and [GP05], (this appears explicitly as Theorem 4.3 in [Ioa07]), every non-amenable group \u0393 has a free ergodic\naction \u0393 y A such that there is a rigid inclusion (A0 \u2282 N ) with A = A\u20320 \u2229 N (in\n(2)\nfact they have uncountably non-orbit equivalent such actions). If \u03b21 (\u0393) > 0 then\nby the previous theorem A is the only Cartan subalgebra which contains such a\nrigid subalgebra. Therefore F (A \u22ca \u0393) = F (A \u2282 A \u22ca \u0393), and the result follows from\n[Gab02].\n\u0003\nReferences\n[AW81] Charles A. Akemann and Martin E. Walter.
