There is evidence for an I = 1, J P C = 2\u2212+ resonance in \u03b7\u03b7\u03c0 0 with mass M =\n1880 \u00b1 20 MeV and width 255 \u00b1 45 MeV, decaying strongly to a2 (1320)\u03b7; it is too strong\nto be explained as the high mass tail of \u03c02 (1670) \u2192 a2 (1320)\u03b7. There is tentative evidence\nalso for weak decays to f0 (1500)\u03c0. It makes a natural partner to the \u03b72 (1860).\n\u03b7\u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0\n\nIn earlier studies of p\u0304p \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 data in flight, we have presented evidence for I = 0\nJ P C = 2\u2212+ states with masses 1645, 1860 and 2030 MeV [1,2]. Here, we study the final state\n\u03b7\u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , with the objective of searching for corresponding I = 1 resonances decaying to \u03b7\u03b7\u03c0 0 .\nThe data were taken with the Crystal Barrel detector at LEAR [3]. The analysis techniques\nrun closely parallel to those used in studying \u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , so we shall refer to the earlier papers\nfor a description of the experimental set-up and details concerning amplitude analysis. Here we\nbegin by outlining the detector briefly.\nThe p\u0304 beam interacted in a liquid hydrogen target 4.4 cm long at the centre of the detector.\nThe beam was counted by a coincidence between a small proportional chamber P and a silicon\ncounter SiC of 5 mm diameter placed \u223c 5 cm upstream of the target. Two veto counters 20\ncm downstream of the target were used to select interactions. The beam intensity was typically\n2 \u00d7 105 p\u0304/s. A multiwire chamber and a silicon vertex detector close to the target and covering\n98% of the solid angle were used for a trigger on neutral final states. The data-taking rate\nsaturated at \u223c 60 events/s.\nThe essential element of the detector for present purposes was a barrel of 1380 CsI crystals,\neach of 16 radiation lengths, detecting photons with high efficiency down to < 20 MeV and with\nan angular resolution of \u00b120 mrad in both polar and azimuthal angles. The energy resolution\nis given by \u2206E/E = 0.025/E 1/4 , where E is in GeV. The angular coverage is 98% of 4\u03c0 solid\nangle. In order to filter out events which obviously fail to conserve energy, the total energy in\nthe CsI crystals was summed on-line [4]; a fast trigger rejected those events with total energy\nfalling \u223c 200 MeV or more below that for p\u0304p annihilation.\nThe off-line analysis follows the procedures of Ref. [1], with minor refinements in data selection based on a Monte Carlo simulation of cross-talk with background channels. Events containing exactly 8 photons are selected; the energy of each photon shower is summed over a block\nof 3 \u00d7 3 neighbouring CsI crystals. Kinematic 7C fits are first made to \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03b7\u03b3\u03b3 and \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3,\nthen 8C fits to 4\u03c0 0 , \u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and \u03b7\u03b7\u03c0 0\u03c0 0 . Events fitting \u03b7\u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 with confidence level CL > 10%\nare used. To eliminate backgrounds from 4\u03c0 0 and \u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , events with CL(3\u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3) > 10\u22123 are\nrejected. Any surviving events from these channels or from other rare channels are rejected if\nthey have CL > CL(\u03b7\u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ). The Monte Carlo simulation reproduces the observed confidence\nlevel distribution down to 10%.\n1\n\nNow at IHEP, Beijing 100039, China\n\n1\n\n\fSource\n4\u03c0 0\n\u03b73\u03c0 0\n\u03c93\u03c0 0\n\u03c9\u03b72\u03c0 0\n5\u03c0 0\n\u03b74\u03c0 0\nWrong combinations\n\nBackground (%)\n0.1\n1.8\n0.7\n6.0\n0.7\n4.0\n1.7\n\nTable 1: Background levels at 1800 MeV/c estimated by the Monte Carlo simulation using\nGEANT.\n\nThe normalisation of cross sections is derived from beam counts P.SiC , the length and density\nof the target, the observed number of events, and the Monte Carlo simulation of detection\nefficiency. A significant rate-dependence of the number of reconstructed events is observed,\nand is consistent with expected pile-up in the CsI crystals, where scintillations have a long time\nconstant, 100 \u03bcs. The correction of cross sections for this rate-dependence is described at length\nin Ref. [5].\nBackgrounds are estimated as follows. The Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate at\nleast 30,000 events in each of 43 exclusive channels containing 4\u201310\u03b3. The generated events are\nfitted both to the original channel (to estimate detection efficiency) and to all other channels (to\nestimate cross-talk). Data are fitted kinematically to all channels having the observed number\nof photons. Numbers of fitted events are then used in a set of 43 \u00d7 43 linear equations, which fit\ncross sections for each channel, with allowance for backgrounds from other channels; a constraint\nis applied that all cross sections are positive or zero. In practice, the background contributions\nto these equations are generally small.\nResulting background levels are illustrated in Table 1 at 1800 MeV/c. The background comes\nlargely from \u03b74\u03c0 0 after the loss of two photons (4.0%), from \u03b7\u03c9\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 after loss of one photon\n(6%) and from \u03b73\u03c0 0 (1.8%). Combinatorics are high in these channels and lead to a background\nwhich follows \u03b7\u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 phase space closely. The background is 14% within errors at all beam\nmomenta; it is included in the amplitude analysis, but results described here are not sensitive to\nthe precise background level. Numbers of accepted events are shown in Table 2, together with\nreconstruction efficiency \u01eb and cross sections.\nMass distributions are shown in Fig. 1 for one beam momentum, 1800 MeV/c. Full histograms\nshow the final fit and dotted histograms show phase space distributions. There is a strong peak\nat \u223c 1285 MeV in \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0, Fig. 1(a), due to either or both of f1 (1285) and \u03b7(1295). In \u03c0\u03b7, there are\npeaks due to a0 (980) and a2 (1320). In \u03b7\u03b7, there is a small enhancement from f0 (1500). The \u03c0\u03c0\nphase space is limited and this mass distribution shows little structure; deviations from phase\nspace arise mostly via reflections from other channels. The \u03c0\u03b7\u03b7 mass distribution shows little\nstructure, but peaks slightly above phase space at high masses.\nThe amplitude analysis fits the following channels to the data:\np\u0304p \u2192 a0 (980)a0 (980)\n\u2192 a0 (980)a2 (1320)\n2\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\n\fFigure 1: Mass distributions at a beam momentum of 1800 MeV/c for (a) \u03c0\u03c0\u03b7, (b) \u03c0\u03b7\u03b7, (c)\n\u03c0\u03b7, (d) \u03b7\u03b7 and (e) \u03c0\u03c0.

The\npeaks fitted to f1 (1285), a0 (980) and a2 (1320) in Figs. 1(a) and (c) slightly over-estimate the\ndata. Inclusion of mass resolution improves the fit to f1 (1285) marginally but has negligible\neffect for a0 (980) and a2 (1320). Altering the widths of the latter two states also has negligible\neffect; although the fits to peaks in Fig. 1(a) and (c) may be improved, the fit to other features\ngets correspondinly worse. Likewise, altering decay branching ratios in equations (6) and (7)\ncan improve the fit at one momentum, but the overall fit is made to all momenta simultaneously.\nIn reaction (3), \u03c3 is a shorthand for the broad f0 (400 \u2212 1200) of the PDG; it has been fitted\nwith the parametrisation of Zou and Bugg [7]. Further final states have been tried, but are\nnot required. As an example, \u03b7(1295)\u03b7 has been tried, replacing or supplementing f1 (1285)\u03b7;\nalso decays of both \u03b7(1295) and f1 (1285) to \u03c3\u03b7 have been tried. There is no significant change\nto the fit, but we cannot exclude some small component due to \u03b7(1295)\u03b7. The background\nunderneath the f1 (1285)/\u03b7(1295) is too large to allow the possibility of fitting this channel in\nterms of partial waves in the production process. Contributions have been tried from \u03c02 (1670)\ndecaying to a0 (980)\u03b7, f2 (1270)\u03c0, f0 (1370)\u03c0 and f2 (1565)\u03c0, but are not needed. In the last\nthree cases, this is hardly surprising; f2 (1270) has a very small decay branching ratio to \u03b7\u03b7,\nand decays of f0 (1370) and f2 (1565) to two-body channels are believed to be weak. The known\ndecay \u03c0(1800) \u2192 f0 (1370)\u03c0, f0 (1370) \u2192 \u03b7\u03b7 was also tried, but found to be negligible.\n4\n\n\fThere are not sufficient events for a full partial wave decomposition of both production and\ndecay. As an approximation, the production process has been ignored and only the decays of\nresonances have been fitted. The objective is to try to identify characteristic decay signatures\nfrom observed angular distributions. Taking reaction (7) as an example, it is assumed that the\n\u03c02 (1880) is produced through three helicity amplitudes, with components of spin along the beam\ndirection 0, \u00b11 and \u00b12. The decay angular distribution of each component is fitted in full, using\nthe method of Wick rotations described in Ref. [1]. In essence, this involves (i) a rotation of\naxes from the beam direction to that of the resonance in the overall centre of mass frame, (ii) a\nLorentz boost to the rest frame of the resonance, (iii) a rotation back through precisely the same\nangles as are used in step (i). In the Lorentz boost, helicity amplitudes are unchanged; in steps\n(i) and (iii), there is a cancellation of rotation matrices. As a result, decay amplitudes may be\nexpressed simply in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The Wick rotation essentially takes\ncare of the Lorentz transformation from the centre of mass to the rest frame of the resonance.\nA second Wick rotation is used for the subsequent decay of a2 (1320) to \u03b7\u03c0.\nBecause beam and target are unpolarised, there is no dependence of cross sections on the\nazimuthal angle around the beam. Consequently, it may be shown that there are no interferences\nbetween different helicities along the beam direction in the final state. Interferences between\nchannels for a given helicity are allowed. However, these occur only over those limited parts of\nphase space where both amplitudes are large; in practice, most of the interferences have negligible\neffect and are dropped. There is, however a large interference between the a0 (980)a2 (1320)\nchannel and \u03c02 (1880) \u2192 a2 (1320)\u03b7. This interference is phase sensitive and helps determine the\nmass and width of \u03c02 (1880) precisely. For a pair of channels such as (5) and (6), where a single\nresonance decays through two different modes, they must be fully coherent and this coherence\nis retained in the fit. Every channel is fitted with a coupling constant at each beam momentum,\nand a phase for those cases where interferences survive.\nChannel\na0 (980)a0 (980)\na0 (980)a2 (1320)\nf0 (1500)\u03c3\nf1 (1285)\u03b7\n\u03c0(1800) \u2192 f0 (1500)\u03b7\n\u03c0(1800) \u2192 a0 (980)\u03b7\n\u03c02 (1880) \u2192 a2 (1320)\u03b7\n\u03c02 (1880) \u2192 f0 (1500)\u03c0\nX(2200)\n\n900 1050 1200 1350 1525 1642 1800 1940\n10\n8\n12\n40\n23\n40\n44\n38\n7\n17\n33\n89\n158\n8\n4\n6\n15\n17\n24\n11\n14\n153 113 173 177 149 264 305 300\n0\n4\n8\n2\n3\n1\n2\n6\n25\n11\n21\n2\n7\n9\n1\n9\n169 152 246\n51\n28\n38\n56\n0\n3\n9\n16\n4\n2\n10\n3\n8\n12\n25\n31\n40\n\nTable 3: Changes in log likelihood when each channel is dropped from the fit and remaining\ncontributions are re-optimised; the top line of the table indicates beam momenta in MeV/c.\nWe now turn to the detailed features of the data. Initial fits were made with channels (1)\u2013\n(6). An additional contribution from \u03c3\u03c3 final states was tried, with one \u03c3 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and the\nsecond \u03c3 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b7; this had no significant effect. The contribution from \u03c0(1800) is small, but just\nsignificant. For example, it improves log likelihood by 29 at 1200 MeV/c in the final fit reported\nbelow (a 6.5\u03c3 effect statistically for 3 fitted parameters). Table 3 illustrates significance levels\n5\n\n\fFigure 2: Full histograms show fits at 1200 MeV/c compared with data; dotted histograms show\nfits without \u03c02 (1880); (a) the \u03c0\u03b7\u03b7 mass distribution, (b) the \u03c0\u03b7 mass distribution, (c) the \u03c0\u03b7\u03b7\nmass distribution for events with a \u03c0\u03b7 combination within \u00b165 MeV of a2 (1320), (d) and (e)\n\u03c0\u03b7 and \u03b7\u03b7 mass distributions for events with M(\u03c0\u03b7\u03b7) 1850-2050 MeV. Units of mass are MeV.\nby giving changes in log likelihood when each channel is dropped in turn from the final fit and\nall other components are re-optimised. Our definition of log likelihood is such that it changes\nby 0.5 for a one standard deviation change in one fitted parameter.\nAt this stage, it became obvious at beam momenta 900\u20131200 MeV/c that several features of\nthe data are fitted poorly, particularly the \u03c0\u03b7\u03b7 mass distribution. This is illustrated in Fig. 2\nwith several distributions at 1200 MeV/c. In each case, the absolute normalisation of histograms\nis taken from the fit. There is a clear requirement for something with \u03c0\u03b7\u03b7 mass around 1880\nMeV with decays to a2 (1320)\u03b7. It improves log likelihood by 246 at 1200 MeV/c and by similar\nlarge amounts at 900 and 1050 MeV/c. Its mass and width are best determined by the data\nat 1050 and 1200 MeV/c; at 900 MeV/c, the upper side of the resonance is cut off. A further\nmarginal improvement is obtained by adding channel (8), \u03c02 (1880) \u2192 [f0 (1500)\u03c0]L=2. The\npossible decay \u03c02 (1880) \u2192 f0 (1370)\u03c0, f0 (1370) \u2192 \u03b7\u03b7 was tried, but found negligible; in view of\n6\n\n\fFigure 3: (a) Variations of log likelihood with mass, summed over data at 1050 and 1200 MeV/c,\nfor quantum numbers J P C = 2\u2212+ , 1++ , 2++ or 3++ ; (b) variation of log likelihood with width\nfor J P C = 2\u2212+ .\nthe known weak decay of f0 (1370) to \u03b7\u03b7, this is not surprising.\nThe mass of the fitted a2 (1320)\u03b7 signal is so close to threshold that only decays with orbital\nangular momentum L = 0 are likely, i.e. quantum numbers J P C = 2\u2212+ . For L = 1 decays,\nalternative quantum numbers are 1++ , 2++ and 3++ . Fig. 3(a) shows the variation of log\nlikelihood with mass, summed over data at 1050 and 1200 MeV/c, for these quantum numbers;\nthe vertical scale is adjusted to zero at the optimum for 2\u2212+ . There is a well defined optimum\nfor these quantum numbers, giving M = 1880 \u00b1 16 MeV, \u0393 = 255 \u00b1 45 MeV. The errors cover\nthe variations over the four beam momenta 900-1350 MeV/c. For other quantum numbers,\ncurves of Fig. 3 use the optimum widths, including appropriate centrifugal barrier factors. Log\nlikelihood is worse by at least 109 for 1++ , 125 for 2++ and 112 for 3++ ; each of these differences\nfrom 2\u2212+ corresponds to at least a 14 standard deviation effect. For L = 1 decays, it is the\ncentrifugal barrier which prevents an adequate fit to the a2 (1320)\u03b7 threshold region. A second\npoint is that 1++ and 3++ states cannot be produced with orbital angular momentum l = 0 in\nthe production process, since this would require exotic quantum numbers 1\u2212+ and 3\u2212+ for the\ninitial state and these are forbidden for p\u0304p; a centrifugal barrier of at least l = 1 is required in\nthe production process and plays a significant role in ruling out these quantum numbers.\nFig. 3(b) shows the variation of log likelihood with the width fitted to \u03c02 (1880). Our\nexperience elsewhere is that 1/\u0393 follows an approximately normal distribution; we use this\nresult in determining an estimate of the optimum width, \u0393 = 255 \u00b1 45 MeV. The error is mostly\nstatistical, but includes a small systematic component.\nThe VES collaboration has also reported a threshold enhancement in a2 (1320)\u03b7 with J P = 2\u2212\nin their \u03b7\u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 data [8]. An even clearer threshold peak is observed in their \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 data, where\na2 (1320) \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ; there is also a strong peak at the same mass in the f2 (1270)\u03c0 D-wave in\ntheir 4\u03c0 data [9]. Daum et al. [10] also observed a peak at 1850 MeV in the f2 (1270)\u03c0 D-wave\nwith a width of \u223c 240 MeV. They interpreted it as arising from interference between \u03c02 (1670)\nand a higher \u03c02 (2100). That interpretation fails to fit the present data, since the peak at 1880\nMeV in a2 (1320)\u03b7 cannot be explained as the high mass tail of \u03c02 (1670), as we show below.\nFurthermore, the peak in the f2 (1270)\u03c0 D-wave cannot plausibly be explained as due only to\nthe high mass tail of \u03c02 (1670), since our calculations show that the L = 2 centrifugal barrier is\n7\n\n\fFigure 4: Cross sections fitted to individual channels; points with errors show the overall cross\nsection for \u03b7\u03b7\u03c0 0\u03c0 0 .\nnot strong enough to shift the peak position by \u223c 180 MeV.\nFitted cross sections are illustrated in Fig. 4. There is a strong contribution from \u03c02 (1880)\nat low beam momenta, falling at high momenta. The earlier analysis of \u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 found an\nanalogous peak due to \u03b72 (1860) at beam momenta 900\u20131200 MeV/c [2].\nIn initial fits to data, the decay branching ratio of \u03c02 (1880) between a2 (1320)\u03b7 and f0 (1500)\u03c0\nwas fitted freely for beam momenta 900\u20131350 MeV/c. The weighted average was then formed\nand the final fit is made with this weighted mean. The result, corrected for all charge states\nand the branching ratio of a2 (1320) \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0, is\nBR[\u03c02 (1880) \u2192 f0 (1500)\u03c0]/BR[\u03c02 (1880) \u2192 a2 (1320)\u03b7] = 0.28+0.20\n\u22120.15 .\n\n(10)\n\nThe significance level of the decay to f0 (1500)\u03c0 is \u223c 3\u03c3 because the errors are not symmetric\nabout the mean. If this decay is omitted, other components of the fit change very little.\nThe branching ratio of \u03c0(1800) between f0 (1500)\u03c0 and a0 (980)\u03b7 has been treated likewise,\nwith the result\nBR[\u03c0(1800) \u2192 a0 (980)\u03b7]/BR[\u03c0(1800) \u2192 f0 (1500)\u03c0] = 0.030+0.014\n\u22120.011 .\n\n(11)\n\nThe numerical value of this ratio is small because the f0 (1500) couples only weakly to \u03b7\u03b7. Our\nvalue is somewhat smaller than the value quoted by VES [8], namely 0.08 \u00b1 0.03, but the errors\nof both determinations are sizeable. The mass and width of the \u03c0(1800) are not determined\naccurately from the present data, and are therefore set to PDG values, namely M = 1801 MeV,\n\u0393 = 210 MeV.\nWe turn now to the higher beam momenta, 1525\u20131940 MeV/c. There, the a0 (980)a2 (1320)\nchannel makes a highly significant contribution. However, the fit to the a2 (1320) peak is not quite\n8\n\n\fFigure 5: Histograms show fits at 1800 MeV/c compared with data, (a) and (b) including\nchannel (9), (c) and (d) without it; (a) and (c) show the \u03c0\u03b7\u03b7 mass distribution, (b) and (d)\nshow this mass distribution for events with a \u03c0\u03b7 combination within \u00b165 MeV of a2 (1320).\nMasses are in MeV.\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 6: Variations of log likelihood with mass, summed over data from 1525 to 1940 MeV/c,\nfor quantum numbers J P C = 2\u2212+ , 1++ , 2++ or 3++ .\nperfect without some further small contribution from channel (9), i.e. something of mass 20502200 MeV decaying to a2 (1320)\u03b7. This is a mass region where many resonances are expected with\nJ P up to 4+ . At all beam momenta 1525-1940 MeV, the fitted mass for this extra component\noptimises close to the top of the available mass range. Taking these four momenta together, the\noptimum is at a mass M = 2200 \u00b1 40 MeV with width \u0393 = 225 \u00b1 50 MeV. Fig. 5 illustrates\nthe small improvement in the fit at a beam momentum of 1800 MeV/c from adding channel (9).\nAs one sees from Figs. 5(a) and (b), the fit including channel (9) makes some improvement,\nbut does not succeed in removing the discrepancy completely, possibly indicating the need for\nmore than one contribution, presently unresolved; a better fit may be improved by increasing\nthe mass of channel (9) above 2200 MeV, but appears unphysical.\nFig. 6 show the variation of log likelihood with the mass fitted to channel (9) for quantum\nnumbers 2\u2212+ , 1++ , 2++ and 3++ . For all J P C , the improvement in the fit is small, but significant.\nWe find that the quantum numbers giving the best fit are J P = 1+ or 2+ decaying to a2 (1320)\u03b7\nwith L = 1. Unfortunately, the distinction between these two possibilities is poor. Summing\nover data at the four momenta 1525-1940 MeV/c, log likelihood is better by 7 for J P = 1+ ,\nbut this is a barely significant difference; at two momenta 1++ gives slightly the better fit and\nat the other two momenta 2++ is preferred. Data for I = 0 channels [11,12] have located an\nf2 resonance at 2240 MeV and a 2\u2212+ resonance at 2267 MeV. Channel (9) could be due to the\nI = 1 analogues of either of these states.\nData on p\u0304p \u2192 \u03b73\u03c0 0 [2] at 1525-1940 MeV/c show features similar to the present data. There\nis an analogous high mass contribution in \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0 which peaks at the highest available mass at all\nmomenta. The statistics of those data are higher by a factor 10, and it is possible to identify the\npreferred quantum numbers of the high mass contribution as 2++ \u2192 f2 (1270)\u03b7 and a2 (1320)\u03c0 0 .\nThis is a hint that 2++ may contribute to present data. Final fits to present data are therefore\nmade with this J P C , but are almost indistinguishable from 1++ . We see the possibility that the\ncontribution from the 2050\u20132200 mass range could come from more than one state.\nAn obvious question is whether a wider \u03c02 alone could fit data at all momenta. This is not\nthe case. Data at 1642\u20131940 MeV/c can be fitted with a single broad resonance with mass\n10\n\n\f\u223c 2150 MeV and width 500 MeV. However, the data at 900\u20131200 MeV/c cannot be fitted with\nthe same broad resonance. If this attempted, log likelihood gets worse by typically 25 at each\nmomentum. The fit to the \u03c0\u03b7\u03b7 mass distribution then lies very close to phase space and the\npeaks of Fig. 2(a) and (c) are not reproduced. Another point is that data at 1525-1940 MeV/c\nprefer a contribution in the \u03c0\u03b7\u03b7 mass range 2050\u20132300 MeV with J P C = 2++ or 1++ rather\nthan 2\u2212+ .\nA second question is whether the signal fitted as \u03c02 (1880) could be due to the high mass\ntail of \u03c02 (1670) and the opening of the a2 (1320)\u03b7 channel. This possibility has been tried but\nfails. The effect of the extra channel is to add to the Breit-Wigner denominator of the \u03c02 (1670)\na width \u0393(a2 \u03b7); assuming ideal mixing between f2 (1270) and a2 (1320), this width is related to\nthe decay width to f2 \u03c0 by their relative phase space:\n\u0393(a2 \u03b7) = (0.8)2 (k\u03b7 /k\u03c0 )\u0393(f2 \u03c0);\n\n(12)\n\nhere values of k are average momenta for the two decay channels in the resonance rest frame,\nfolding in the line-shapes of f2 (1270) and a2 (1320). The factor (0.8)2 allows for the non-strange\ncontent of the \u03b7. The value of k\u03b7 /k\u03c0 rises rapidly from threshold and is 0.35 at 1880 MeV.\nHowever, the line-shape of \u03c02 (1670) suppresses high momenta. The mean value of k\u03b7 /k\u03c0 , averaged over the line-shape of \u03c02 (1670), is 0.22. So \u0393(a2 \u03b7) is small and can be neglected to a\ngood approximation in the Breit-Wigner amplitude for \u03c02 (1670). If the data are fitted with the\n\u03c02 (1670) (using the PDG mass and width) instead of \u03c02 (1880), there is an unacceptable increase\nin log likelihood: 108 at 1050 MeV/c and 97 at 1200 MeV/c. The \u03c02 (1670) is too narrow to\nreproduce the high mass side of the \u03c02 (1880). When \u0393(a2 \u03b7) is included in the denominator of\nthe Breit-Wigner amplitude for the \u03c02 (1670), it suppresses the amplitude above the a2 \u03b7 threshold, making the resonance appear narrower and making the discrepancy with present data even\nworse.\nThe explanation of \u03c02 (1880) as the high mass tail of \u03c02 (1670) is also ruled out by the large\nobserved cross section for production of \u03c02 (1880). We have earlier studied p\u0304p \u2192 4\u03c0 0 ; results at\none beam momentum were presented in Ref. [13]. In those data, there is a well defined signal\ndue to p\u0304p \u2192 \u03c02 (1670)\u03c0 0 , \u03c02 (1670) \u2192 f2 (1270)\u03c0 0. It contributes a fraction 15\u201320% of the 4\u03c0 0\ndata at all beam momenta and a cross section \u223c 20\u03bcb. The cross section for p\u0304p \u2192 \u03c02 (1670)\u03c0 0 ,\n\u03c02 (1670) \u2192 a2 (1320)\u03b7 may then be estimated using equn. (12). It is necessary to allow for the\n14.5% branching ratio of a2 (1320) \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 and the 28.2% branching ratio of f2 (1270) \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 .\nFolding in the line-shape of \u03c02 (1670), the predicted cross section in present data is \u223c 0.7\u03bcb.\nThis is a factor 5\u201310 lower than the observed cross section shown in Fig. 4(a). In our earlier\nwork on p\u0304p \u2192 \u03b73\u03c0 0 , the same argument ruled out the explanation of \u03b72 (1860) as the high mass\ntail of \u03b72 (1645) [1]; there, the \u03b72 (1860) \u2192 f2 (1270)\u03b7 signal is likewise a factor \u223c 11 \u2212 22 larger\nthan that predicted for \u03b72 (1645) \u2192 f2 (1270)\u03b7.\nWe have tried fitting present data with a Flatt\u00e9 formula for \u03c02 (1880) where \u0393(a2 \u03b7) is related\nto \u0393(f2 \u03c0) by equn. (12). This increases the fitted mass by 5 MeV, because of the suppression\nof the upper side of the resonance by the rising phase space for a2 \u03b7. However, the magnitude\nof possible contributions of the f2 (1270)\u03c0 D-wave and other channels are not known and could\nhave larger effects in the Flatt\u00e9 formula than a2 \u03b7. Hence we simply include the possible 5 MeV\nshift into an overall error of \u00b120 MeV for the mass.\nThe observed strong decay of \u03c02 (1880) to a2 (1320)\u03b7 makes it a natural partner for \u03b72 (1860),\nwhich decays strongly to f2 (1270)\u03b7 and a2 (1320)\u03c0 [2]. This makes it unlikely that the \u03b72 (1860)\n11\n\n\fis the nonet (dominantly ss\u0304) partner of \u03b72 (1645). Our earlier publication, Ref. [2], finds three \u03b72\nresonances at 1645, 1860 and 2030 MeV. There are too many 2\u2212+ states in a narrow mass range\nfor all to be accomodated as q q\u0304 states. We conjectured in Ref. [2] that \u03b72 (1860) is a candidate\nfor a hybrid expected at roughly this mass. Decays \u03b72 (1860) \u2192 f2 (1270)\u03b7 and a2 (1320)\u03c0 and\ndecays \u03c02 (1880) \u2192 a2 (1320)\u03b7 are favoured for a hybrid in the flux-tube model [14].\nIn summary, we find evidence for a new state having I = 1, J P C = 2\u2212+ , with M = 1880 \u00b1 20\nMeV, \u0393 = 255 \u00b1 45 MeV, decaying strongly to a2 (1320)\u03b7; there is also a possible weak decay\nmode to f0 (1500)\u03c0, but this is only a 3\u03c3 effect. There is some evidence for a further contribution\nwith mass \u223c 2200 decaying to a2 (1320)\u03b7, but it is weak and we are unable to distinguish clearly\nbetween quantum numbers 1++ and 2++ .\nWe thank the Crystal Barrel Collaboration for allowing use of the data.
