A widespread quantum mechanical\n1\n\n\fapplication of the theory is when an electron in a molecule slowly evolves\nsubject to a field due to (say) the host ions, such that the field varies periodically in time. In typical cases the electronic state changes sign after a full\nperiod [1]. It is entirely obvious that for a pair of electrons, which are independent except that both are subject to fields with the same period (though\nthe fields may have otherwise different characters) the total electronic wave\nfunction (being a product of two individual wave functions) will return to its\noriginal value after a period. Similarly, when the field on the second electron\nis a constant or has a period which is 12 or 41 (and so on) times the period for\nthe first field then, after one complete revolution, the total wave function\nwill again acquire a change of sign. It is of interest to consider next what\nhappens to the geometrical phase if one introduces an interaction between\nthe two electrons. One would expect that the geometrical phase would not\nbe altered by the interaction. This is indeed the case for the model studied in this work, with one notable exception: When the two-electron states\nbecome degenerate by some coincidence of the parameters in the Hamiltonian, then under suitable conditions the expected sign change becomes\nreversed. This phenomenon is studied in this work. Other aspects of states\nthat have degeneracies on or off the trajectories have been noted earlier in\n[8, 9]. The topological phase change after a full revolution has been interpreted in several previous publication as a surface integral in the parameter\nspace [1, 4]. We find the acquired phase by a different method: namely, by\nnumerical integration of the time dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which is\nthe appropriate method for circumstances that the surface integral is not\nreadily available. Moreover, this method, which was previously used for a\nsingle electron [10, 11, 12], gives the entire open path phase, rather then the\ngeometrical phase alone. Theoretical expressions and interpretations for the\nopen path phase were given in [13, 14]. The last section contains algebraic\nand numerically less convenient calculations.\n\n2\n\nThe physical model\n\nBrief descriptions of the model have been given previously [15, 16]. In\nessence, we consider a dimer consisting of two vibrating, planar and possibly dissimilar molecules lying upon each other. A simple instance is two\ntriatomic molecules A3 - B3 . In addition to several tightly bound electrons,\neach molecule contains one electron that is in an orbital doublet state, degenerate in the symmetric (equilateral triangle) configuration of its host.\n\n2\n\n\fThe molecules are sufficiently remote for the orbital doublets to be localized on the host molecule and also for overlap (and exchange) effects to\nbe negligible. There remain vibronic interactions between the electronic\nand the in-plane vibrational motions, as well as an inter-electronic coupling.\nThe former (Jahn-Teller) interaction [17] is conveniently treated by the formalism of Longuet-Higgins et al [18], which represents the two electronic\nstates by e\u00b1i\u03b8m , where \u03b8m an angular variable and m = 1, 2 for the two\nmolecules. In this work we shall modify this formalism by using as the basis the direct product of two real representations, namely cos \u03b81 cos \u03b82 , etc.\nThe non-totally symmetric vibrational mode coordinates of the molecules\nare denoted by qm cos \u03c6m and qm sin \u03c6m [17]. In terms of the electronic and\nvibrational coordinates, as given above, and the vibronic coupling strengths\nGm , the interaction may be simply expressed as\nHm = Gm cos(2\u03b8m \u2212 \u03c6m )\n\nm = 1, 2\n\n(1)\n\n\u00bfFrom elementary physical considerations, the vibronic constants Gm are\n(at least approximately) proportional to the mode amplitudes qm . The\ninteraction between electrons on the two molecular entities is familiar from\nenergy transfer and other subjects, and is expressed by terms that contain\njointly excitation and de-excitation operators on two molecules [19]. For\nsimplicity we assume for the interaction term the large U (t/U \u2192 0),\"antiferromagnetic Heisenberg\" limit of the well-known Hubbard Hamiltonian\n[20] , having the product form\nH12 = 2G cos(2\u03b81 \u2212 \u03c61 ) cos(2\u03b82 \u2212 \u03c62 )\n\n(2)\n\nThis is symmetric and even in the relative angular variables and is invariant under a full rotation of either mode angular variable \u03c6m . Analogously\nto Hubbard's U which gives the exchange splitting between like and unlike\nspins on the same site, G represents the electrostatic splitting between like\nand unlike vibronic states on the two molecules. G depends foremost on\nthe distance between the molecules and only weakly on the molecular displacement coordinates. In previous works [15, 16] the cases Gm larger and\nsmaller than G were studied separately.(To exhibit formally the weakness of\noverlap effects, one would introduce, both in the wave functions and in the\ncouplings, two more factors that depend on two further coordinates, (say) r1\nand r2 , such that the overlaps between the r1 and r2 factors are negligible.)\nThe total Hamiltonian H is the sum of equations(1) and (2).\nH = H1 + H2 + H12\n3\n\n(3)\n\n\fWe next represent the vibrations of the molecules as rotational motions\nin the (q, \u03c6) -planes. (The potential surfaces in Figure 3.3 of [17] admit\nof such motion.) Classically, this is equivalent to taking q1 = constant,\nq2 = constant, \u03c61 = \u03c91 t, \u03c62 = \u03c92 t, where t is time and \u03c91 and \u03c92 are the\nangular frequencies of the (small) molecular displacements.

With the choice of \u03c91 = 1 and \u03c92 a\nsimple multiple of \u03c91 , the periodicity is 2\u03c0 and the solutions exhibited in the\nfollowing figures stretch over a single period of the Hamiltonian, t = 0 \u2212 2\u03c0.\nBeyond this, the solutions can be obtained by symmetry. The initial value of\n\u03a8 at t = 0 was taken as (1, 0, 0, 0). This choice implies no loss of generality,\nsince any other solution can be derived from this through a change of the\nparameters, shift of the time scale and superposition of solutions. The analytic treatment of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation including the interaction, given\nin the last section , involves the solution of a quartic equation which is not\ndecomposable into two quadratic equations. This stands in contrast to the\none-electron two- state problem, whose Schr\u00f6dinger equation involves the\nsolution of a quadratic [21, 22, 12]. Thus the interaction introduces in the\nproblem a genuinely new element.\n(A) Non-adiabatic effects.\nWe first investigate the approach to the adiabatic limit, which is the\ncondition under which the results of [1] were derived. To achieve this limit,\nat least one of the coupling coefficients G1 , G2 and G has to be large.\n(Basically, their ratio to omega serves as the measure of adiabaticity [11].\n1\nWe define it by A = | G\n\u03c91 |) The approach to adiabaticity is exemplified in\nFigure 1, whose two curves have identical parameters except that all coupling\nstrengths are reduced by a factor 10 in the thinly drawn curve , thus not\nyet reaching the adiabatic limit.\nIn either curve there is a sign change in the wave function at full revolution, but the lack of adiabaticity shows up in two ways: First, in the state\namplitudes it induces oscillations, whose periods depend on the coupling\nstrength. These oscillations are the ionic-field analogues of the Rabi oscillations (that are due to excitations by an electro-magnetic field). The former\nhave been analyzed in detail in an earlier paper on a two-state model [12].\nSecondly, the state amplitude does not reach -1, but only approximately\n-.75. This reduction has already been quantitatively explained for the two\nstate model in [10] and will not be further discussed here. In the fully adiabatic limit, the solution can be read off from the analytic expressions given\nin equation (7) . Having started (by virtue of the initial conditions imposed)\nwith \u03c81AD , we see that the thick curve shown in Fig. 1 indeed approximates\n5\n\n\fRe Amplitude\n1\n0.5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\ntime\n\n-0.5\n-1\n\nFigure 1: Non-adiabaticity effects in the real part of the initially excited\ncomponent, as a function of time.

As is well known, this theorem is based on the noncrossing of energy levels [23]. In the absence of inter-electronic coupling, the\ntwo electrons move independently and, therefore, even if there was a degeneracy in the system through the combination of the levels, no effect would\nbe felt. For a coupled two-electron system, the degeneracy is expected to\nproduce new effects.\nThis was indeed found. Thus, when in equation (2) the inter-electron\ncoupling was so adjusted that\nG = \u2212G1\n\n(8)\n\nthen the first two levels in equation (7) become degenerate. The accompanying curves (a)-(c) in Figure 4 show the way the amplitude (of the first\ncomponent) changes as this degeneracy is traversed through subsequent sequence of changes in G. The results are similar when the changes are made\n6\n\n\fReAmplitude\n1\n0.75\n0.5\n0.25\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\ntime\n\n-0.25\n-0.5\n-0.75\n\nFigure 2: Two-electron state amplitudes in a dimer.

The curves are computed in\nthe near-adiabatic limit.\nOne observes that with degenerate parameters, the amplitude keeps its\nsign at a half period and achieves at full revolution a switched sign with\nrespect to that in the non-degenerate situation. The switch occurs abruptly\nas the coupling strength(s) is (are) varied. We now turn to a discussion of\nthis switch, regarding its dependence on adiabaticity and its stability, an\napplication and the algebraic treatment of the results.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe preceding figure (fig. 4) was plotted in the near adiabatic limit when\n1\nA = |G\n\u03c91 | is large(= 40).In the extreme adiabatic limit when A = \u221e only the\nsymmetric ( thin ) line (ending at +1) and the antisymmetric (thick) line\n(ending at \u22121) are possible, the latter occurring at exact degeneracy and\nthe former for any values of the parameters that do not cause exact degeneracy.When the adiabaticity parameter A is finite, though large, for large\ndeviation from degeneracy the computed curve approaches the symmetric\ncurve and for small values of the deviation , the antisymmetric curve. It is\npossible to describe this effect quantitatively, by finding a relation between\nthe adiabaticity A and that value of the deviation from precise degeneracy\n\n8\n\n\fat which the real part of the amplitude at full revolution (at time = 2\u03c0) is\nzero (i.e., just half way between the values far from and exactly at degeneracy). Attaching to this value of the deviation from degeneracy the subscript\n0, we find from our computation for the present model\n|(G + G1 )0 | = 0.54\n\n|G1 |\nA\n\n(9)\n\n(We recall that at G + G1 = 0 one has a strict degeneracy.) For a numerical\nillustration of this result, when the adiabaticity A = 40 (this being the absolute value of the ratio of the coupling strength G1 to the angular frequency\nof motion \u03c91 , as e.g. when G1 = \u221240, \u03c91 = 1), then a deviation from degeneracy less than 0.54 will cause in the phase a switch whose magnitude\nis at least \u03c02 .In fig. 4, the thin line is for a deviation 4 that is larger than\n0.54 and the phase switch is close to zero , the medium thick line is for a\ndeviation of .4, which is below the 0.54 limit and the phase switch is larger\nthan \u03c02 .Though equation (9) is derived from numerical fitting (of over one\nand a half orders of magnitude in A and to an average accuracy of about\nfive percent) for a specific model, we expect that a qualitatively similar relation would hold in other cases where the degeneracy causes a switch in the\nphase. A deviation from (or removal of) the degeneracy can also achieved\nby adding off-diagonal terms \u03b4H12 = \u03b4H21 in the (1, 2) and (2, 1) positions\nto he Hamiltonian matrix of equation(6).When these perturbation terms are\nconstants their effect on the switching is given very closely by equation (9)\n, when the deviation on the left hand side stands for \u03b4H12 , or the added\nmatrix element.This represents a test for the stability of the switch against\na small deviation from the special form of the interaction assumed in this\nwork. (It would be tempting to combine the two findings into a single formula, in which the left hand side of equation (9) is simply the splitting of\nthe two near degenerate levels, given by\n1\n\nsplitting = ((G + G1 )20 + 4(\u03b4H12 )2 ) 2\n\n(10)\n\nbut our numerical results indicate that the above formula holds without the\nfactor 4.)\nA further stability test was also made: When a constant was added to\neach of the terms in top-right to bottom-left diagonal, the computed curves\nwere not changed in a perceptible way, even when the constant reached .2\nof the (root mean square) value of the term.\n\n9\n\n\fA vibrating dimer, carrying one electron on either molecule, was used as\na model system to introduce the formalism. We now turn to an alternative\napplication.\nThe four state formalism in this paper can be naturally interpreted as a\ntwo-qubit system. \"Qubits\" are two-state building-blocks for quantum computing. (An introductory account is found in [24].)The two-qubit situation\nis the minimal one to describe logical operations between control and target\n[25, 26], and it has also been shown to be sufficient for that purpose [27].\nFor an identification of logical operations in a two-qubit scheme, one can\nrefer to [28]. The correspondence between the time dependent description\n(or the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (4), on which the present work is based) and\nquantum computing has been developed in [29]. One of the several possible\nimplementation is the use of trapped ions in doublet quantum states [30].\nas a control-no gate. This may be done as follows. We have seen that as\nthe first and second components in equation (7) are brought to degeneracy through the choice G \u2192 \u2212G1 , then (upon full revolution) there is a\nsign-switch in the first component in equation (7) . Likewise, in the second\n(co-degenerate) component. There is, however, no switch in the third or in\nthe fourth components (which are energetically distinct). Suitable combinations (e.g., sum and difference) of the first two components can thus be\nused for representation of \"Yes\" and \"No\" operations, with the choice of the\ncoupling parameters acting as control. One important result of this paper\nis the abrupt switching of the geometric phase through a slight change in\nthe coupling strength, as shown in Figure 4, and this can be conveniently\nused for manipulation on the target, or of the outcome, by external control.\nThe abruptness of the switching is of some additional interest, in that the\nchange in the total phase of the target, upon a slight change of the parameter, is more due to the geometric phase than to the change in the dynamic\nphase. This means that the dynamic phase need not necessarily be subtracted from the total phase. Abrupt switching of the Pancharatnam phase\nfor two polarized light beams was described and observed earlier [31].\nFurther extension of our results might involve consideration of several\n(more than two) qubit states. This may be applicable to quantum computation, in which an important issue is how to achieve reduction of decoherence\nof phases by random causes. It has thus been proposed that a possible way\nis the use of superposition states composed of several qubits [32, 24].\n\n10\n\n\f5\n\nAlgebraic treatment\n\nThe solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (4) and equation (6) , obtained in\nthe text numerically, can be exhibited through a sequence of(three) matrix\nmultiplications operating on a column (four) - vector \u03c7\n~ (t) which contains\nthe initial conditions.

Also (as the numerical solutions show), two components in the four-vector become vanishingly small\nthroughout the time-range. With the initial conditions chosen for our solution, the vanishing components are the second and the fourth. If we remove\nthe corresponding rows and columns from the Hamiltonian shown in equation (6) , the resulting two-by-two matrix becomes under the degeneracy\ncondition G1 = \u2212G,\nH =\n\u2212\n\n1 (G2 + G cos \u03c61 ) cos \u03c62 (G2 + G cos \u03c61 ) sin \u03c62\n(G2 + G cos \u03c61 ) sin \u03c62 \u2212(G2 + G cos \u03c61 ) cos \u03c62\n2\n1\nG cos \u03c61\n(a scalar)\n2\n12\n\n!\n\n(19)\n\n\fSince (G2 + G cos \u03c61 ) is a common factor for all elements in the matrix, it\ndoes not enter the component amplitudes and these contain only the angle\n\u03c62 . This represents a second algebraic justification for the phase switch\nupon degeneracy.\nThe relation in equation (8) represents a three dimensional surface of\ndegeneracy in the four dimensional displacement-manifold [15, 16]. Actually, the surface is (as expected) only two dimensional, for the following\nreason: The degeneracy involves states 1 and 2. An off-diagonal coupling\nbetween these states would lift the degeneracy, even if this coupling would\nbe so weak as not to affect the dynamic behavior. By our ignoring this coupling, we effectively put it equal to zero, which represents a further relation\nbetween some of the coordinates, say, between q1 and q2 .In summary, we\nhave investigated both the geometric phase (i.e., at full revolution) and the\ninterim open path phases for two interacting electrons, each in a doublet\nstate, when they move in cyclically varying potentials. With the choice of a\nproduct inter electron potential, the eigen energies are constants along the\nmotion. The dynamic phase (being the time integral of an eigen energy)\ncan thus be conveniently subtracted off from the total phase. With more\ngeneral interactions, one would need a more complicated procedure for subtraction. We have identified non-adiabatic effects (namely, high frequency\noscillations and the incomplete return to the initial state after a full revolution). We then elucidated a switch of the sign of the wave-function as the\nsystem develops a degeneracy in the two-electron energy levels. The switch\nwas shown to be quite sudden as the degeneracy situation was approached\nthrough varying the parameters in the Hamiltonian.\n\n6\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nThe authors thank Professor Alden Mead for critical readings of the manuscript\nand Dr. Tal Mor for discussing some computing aspects.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.V.
