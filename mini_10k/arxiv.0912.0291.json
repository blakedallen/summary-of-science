Szamotulski\nMszamot@gmail.com\nNovember 1, 2018\n\nAbstract\nWe introduce Galois Theory for Hopf\u2013Galois Extensions proving existence of a Galois connection between subalgebras of an H-comodule algebra and generalised quotients of the Hopf\nalgebra H. Moreover, we show that these quotients Q which define Q-Galois extension are\nthe closed elements of our Galois connection. We discus the important problem of existence\nof a bijective correspondence between right ideals coideals and right coideal subalgebras of a\nHopf algebra. For cleft extensions we characterise closed elements of the Galois connection\nas Hopf\u2013Galois extensions. We describe the relation of our results to the work of F. van Oystaeyen, Y. Zhang and also to the results of P. Schauenburg on biGalois extensions.\n\nWe present a construction of a Galois connection between the complete lattice of subalgebras\nof an H-comodule algebra A and the complete lattice of generalised quotients of a Hopf algebra\nH (quotients by coideals right ideals):\nTheorem (Galois Theory for H-comodule algebras). For an H-comodule algebra A over a field k\nthere exists a Galois connection (Definition 1.2):\nSubalg (A/Aco H )\n\nQuotgen (H)\nAco Q\n\n(1)\n\nQ\n\nwhere Quotgen (H) = {H/I : I - coideal right ideal of H}.\nFor short we will call this theorem 'Galois Theory'. It is a core of a Galois Theory and connects\ninteresting areas: classical Galois Theory for field extensions, Hopf\u2013Galois Theory, which can be now\nformulated as a Galois Theory, and Lattice Theory. First important conclusion of this result is a\nbijection between closed elements, i.e. elements which belong to the image of a Galois connection. On the left hand side, closed elements are the extensions of the form: A/Aco Q for some\nQ \u2208 Quotgen (H) (which we call H-subextensions). Our aim is to describe closed elements of the\nright hand side. This will answer the question: which quotients of H classifies the extensions\nof the form A/Aco Q ? In Proposition 4.2 we show that if Q is such that Aco Q \u2286 A is Q-Galois\n(Definition 3.4), then Q is closed. From both ?, Remark 1.2 and Proposition 4.2 it follows that if\nB \u2208 Subalg (A/Aco H ) and Q \u2208 Quotgen (H) are such that:\n1. B \u2286 Aco Q , and can : A \u2297B A\n\nA \u2297 Q is bijective,\n\n2. A is right or left faithfully flat over B,\n\n\fthen B and Q are the corresponding closed elements.\nWe note that, the above Theorem can be extended to the case of C-comodule algebras where\nC is a coalgebra with a group-like element.\nWe provide all the ingredients of the theory, namely: we prove that the inclusion relation\non the set of right ideals coideals defines a complete lattice structure. We show that the set\nof subobjects, i.e. sub-Hopf algebras and more generally subalgebras right coideals1 of a Hopf\nalgebra form a complete lattice. When the Hopf algebra is finite dimensional then all the lattices\nare algebraic and dually algebraic (Definition 1.5).\nFurthermore, we prove that in the case of the H-extension k \u2286 H and cleft extensions Q \u2208\nQuotgen (H) is closed if and only if A/AcoQ is Q-Galois (Proposition 6.7 and Theorem 7.4). Thus in this\ncase, the generalised quotients Q \u2208 Quotgen (H) which are Q-Galois classifies H-subextensions.\nThis subject was already investigated in ?? and ? but lack of explicit formulas in terms of\nHopf algebra structures led to difficulties to define the Galois connection for the generality that\nwe are dealing with. To overcome these difficulties we use a new approach. We use Lattice\nTheory which provides an explicit formula for a Galois connections between complete lattices in\nterms of the poset structures (see (11)).\nLet us briefly sketch other results that we prove. In finite dimensional case we show the\nfollowing\nTheorem (Finite Hopf\u2013Galois Theory). Let H be a finite dimensional Hopf algebra and A/AcoH an\nH-Hopf\u2013Galois extension. Then the Galois connection (1) restricts to an isomorphism:\nSubH-ext (A/AcoH ) \u2243 Quotgen (H)\nwhere the left hand side is the lattice of all H-extensions, i.e. the extensions of the form A/AcoQ for some\nQ \u2208 Quotgen (H).\nThus the lattice Quotgen (H) classifies intermediate H-extensions of an H-Galois extension A/AcoH .\nFrom our Galois Theory we derive the Chase\u2013Sweedler Theorem which lives on the crossroads of Galois Theory for field extensions and Hopf\u2013Galois Theory. Also generalisation of\nChase\u2013Sweedler Theorem by ?, Theorem 2.3 to the case of a noncommutative H-module algebra\nA such that A is H \u2217 -Hopf\u2013Galois over a finite dimensional Hopf algebra H follows from our\ntheorem for finite Hopf\u2013Galois extensions.\nNext we apply our Galois Theory to the H-extension k \u2286 H. In this case our Galois connection specifies to the following Galois correspondence (we present here the left comodule version\nrather than right one as above):\n(\n)\n(\n)\n\u03c8\n\nK \u2286 H : K - right coideal subalgebra\n\n\u03c6\n\nH/I : I - left ideal coideal\n\n\u03c8(K) = H/HK + , \u03c6(H/I) :=\n\nco H/I\n\n(2)\n\nH\n\nIt was shown by ?, Theorem 3 in commutative case and then proved by A. Masuoka in the noncommutative setting [?, Theorem 1.11] that there is the following bijective correspondence:\n)\n(\n(\n)\nleft ideal coideal,\nK \u2286 H : K-\n\nright coideal subalgebra,\nH faithfully flat over K\n\n\u03c8\n\n\u03c6\n\nH/I : I- H faithfully coflat\nover H/I\n\n(3)\n\nAdditionally H.-J. Schneider proved that the above bijection restricts to normal/conormal elements:\n(\n)\n(\n)\nK \u2286 H : K-\n\n\u03c8\n\nnormal sub-Hopf algebra,\nH faithfully flat over K\n\n\u03c6\n\nnormal Hopf ideal,\n\nH/I : I- H faithfully coflat\nover H/I\n\n(4)\n\n1 Provided lattice theoretic results can be easily extended to the case of subalgebras left coideals and other mixed\nsub/quotient structures.\n\n2\n\n\fIn this case we can sharpen our Galois Theory:\nTheorem. Let H be a Hopf algebra. Then Q \u2208 Quotgen (H) is closed element of the Galois connection (1)\nfor the H-extension H/k if and only if H/H co Q is Q-Galois.\nThere is the question of S. Montgomery if the bijective correspondences (3) and (4) still survive if we\ndon't assume faithfully flat/coflat conditions [see ?]. There is a positive answer to this question in\nthe case of finite dimensional Hopf algebras (Theorem 6.6) due to ?, Corollary 6.5, who showed\nthat H a free module over any right coideal subalgebra, extending the Nichols\u2013Zoeller Theorem.\nOur results allow for a reformulation of the infinite dimensional case:\nProposition. Let H be a Hopf algebra. Then there is a bijective correspondence:\n\u001b\n\u001a\nK \u2286 H : K \u2212 right coideal subalgebra\n\n\u2243\n\n\u001a\n\u001b\nH/I : I \u2212 left ideal coideal\n\n(5)\n\nif and only if\n1. for every its generalised quotient Q the extension co Q H \u2286 H is Q-Galois\n+\n2. co H/K HH \u2286 K for every right coideal subalgebra K of H.\n+\n\nNote that if H is faithfully flat over K then by [?, Remark 1.2] co H/K HH = K. The correspondence (5) can be intuitively understood as follows: let G = Spec(H) be an affine group scheme.\nThe set (of isomorphism classes) of transitive G sets is in bijection with subgroups of G. Right\ncoideal subalgebras generalises transitive G-sets (in commutative case these are affine quotients\nof Spec(H) which poses the natural action of Spec(H)). On the other side, subgroups correspond\nto quotients of the Hopf algebra H (but we go beyond affine quotients as a general quotient might\nnot be an algebra).\nF. van Oystaeyen and Y. Zhang in ? prove a noncommutative generalisation of the Chase\u2013Sweedler\ntheorem. In their paper for the first time appear a remarkable construction of an additional\nHopf algebra. They construct a Hopf algebra L(H, A) associated to a commutative faithfully flat\nH-Hopf\u2013Galois extension A/B (H is also assumed to be commutative). The extension A/B becomes L(H, A)-H-bicomodule algebra and a biGalois extension. This additional structure Hopf algebra L(H, A) classifies intermediate H-comodule subalgebras of A/B. Furthermore, when A/B = E/F\nis a field extension they prove the following Galois theorem:\nTheorem (?, Theorem 4.7). Let k \u2286 F be a field extension and let H be a commutative and cocommutative k-Hopf algebra. Let F \u2286 E be a field extension and an H-Hopf\u2013Galois extension. Then there is a\none-to-one correspondence:\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u001b\nHopf ideals of\nH-subcomodule\n\u2243\n(6)\nF \u2297k H\nsubfields of E\nif I \u2013 a Hopf ideal, and M \u2013 an intermediate field extension of E/F, correspond to each other then\nE/M is F \u2297k (H/I)-Hopf\u2013Galois.\nMoreover, there is the following bijection:\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u001b\nHopf subalgebras of\nH-subcomodule\n\u2243\nF \u2297k H\nsubfields of E\n\n(7)\n\nFurthermore, if H \u2032 and M correspond to each other then\nE/M is (F \u2297k H)/(F \u2297k H)H \u2032+ -Hopf\u2013Galois\n\u2032+\n\u2032\nwhere H := ker \u01eb \u2229 H .\nWhen H is commutative and cocommutative then the Hopf algebra L(H, A) is equal to F\u2297k H [?,\nCorollary 3.4]. The proof of the previous theorem is based on this fact, so that L(H, A) plays an\n3\n\n\fessential role. ? generalises the construction of L(H, A) to noncommutative extensions of rings\nk \u2286 A over noncommutative (and noncocommutative) Hopf algebras. In his work P. Schauenburg proves the following theorem which is an extension of the preceding result of F. van Oystaeyen and Y. Zhang.\nTheorem (?, Theorem 6.4). Let k \u2286 A be a faithfully flat H-Hopf\u2013Galois extension of a ring k. Then\nthere is the following Galois connection:\n\u001a\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u001b\ncoideals left ideals\nH-subcomodule\n(8)\nof L(H, A)\nalgebras of A\nIf B \u2208 SubalgH (A) is an H-subcomodule algebra such that AB is a faithfully projective then it is a\nclosed element of (8). The closed elements of the left hand side are the coideals left ideals which\nare k direct summands of L(H, A). Furthermore, if A is a skew field then the Galois connection (8)\nis an isomorphism. Another result of this type is given in [?, Theorem 3.6] where P. Schauenburg\nshows that the above Galois connection is a bijection on the set of (left, right) admissible objects.\nWhere (right, left) admissibility is the (right, left) faithfully flat/coflat condition (Definition 8.2).\nIn this paper we show a similar statement for the Galois connection (1). We show that the map\nQ\nAco Q of the Galois connection (1) is injective on the subset of (right, left) admissible objects\nprovided A/AcoH is a faithfully flat H-Hopf\u2013Galois extension. The main result of this section\nis Corollary 8.5 in which we conclude that (left, right) admissible quotients of L(A, H) and H\nclassifies the same subalgebras of a k-algebra A.\nWe shall remark, that the Galois correspondences between posets of generalised quotients of\nL(H, A) and subalgebras of A is a special case of our Galois Theory.\n\n1 Preliminaries\nDefinition 1.1. Partially ordered set, poset for short, is a set P together with an order relation \u0016 which\nis reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric.\nDefinition 1.2 (Galois connection). Let (P, \u0016) and (Q, \u2264) be two partially ordered sets. Antimonotonic\nQ and \u03c8 : Q\nP establishes a Galois connection if\nmorphisms of posets \u03c6 : P\n\u2200 p \u0016 \u03c8 \u25e6 \u03c6(p) and \u2200 q \u2264 \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c8(q)\n\np\u2208P\n\nq\u2208Q\n\n(9)\n\nWe refer to this property as the Galois property. An element of P (or Q) will be called closed if it is\ninvariant under \u03c8\u03c6 (\u03c6\u03c8 respectively). Sets of closed elements will be denoted by P and Q. Another name\nwhich appear in the literature for this notion is Galois correspondence.\n\u03c6\n\nProposition 1.3. Let P\n\n\u03c8\n\nQ be a Galois connection. Then the following holds:\n\n1. P = \u03c8(Q) and Q = \u03c6(P )\n2. The restrictions \u03c6|P and \u03c8|Q are inverse bijections of P and Q.\n3. Map \u03c6 is unique in the sense that there exists only one Galois connection of the form (\u03c6\u0303, \u03c8) for some\nmap \u03c6\u0303 : P\nQ, i.e. \u03c6\u0303 = \u03c6. A similar statement holds for \u03c8.\n4. The map \u03c6 is mono (onto) if and only if the map \u03c8 is onto (mono).\n5. If one of the two maps is an isomorphism then the second is its inverse.\nA lattice is a poset in which there exists supremum and infimum of any two elementary subset\nor equivalently of any finite subset. A lattice can also be defined as an algebraic structure which\nhas two binary operations: join (an abstract supremum of two elements) denoted by \u2228 and meet\n(an abstract infimum of two elements) denoted by \u2227. We refer the reader to ? for the theory of\nlattices.\n4\n\n\fDefinition. A lattice (L, \u2228, \u2227) is complete if for every B \u2286 L there exists supB and inf B.\nIn a lattice L there exists arbitrary infima if and only if there are arbitrary suprema.\nDefinition 1.4. An element z of a lattice L is called compact\nW if for any subset S \u2286 L such that z \u2264\nthere exists a finite subset Sf of S with the property z \u2264 Sf .\n\nW\n\nS\n\nDefinition 1.5. A lattice is algebraic if it is complete and every its element is a supremum of compact\nelements. A lattice is dually algebraic if its dual, i.e. the one with the dual order, is algebraic.\nIt is a well known theorem of Universal Algebra that lattices of subalgebras and lattices of\ncongruences (quotient structures) of any algebraic structure are algebraic. In particular, the lattices of sub-objects and quotient objects of classical algebraic structures like groups, semi-groups,\nrings, modules, etc. are algebraic.\n\n2 Lattices of substructures and quotient structures\nProposition 2.1. Let (C, \u2206, \u01eb) be a coalgebra, (B, m, u, \u2206, \u01eb) a bialgebra and (H, m, u, \u2206, \u01eb, S) a Hopf\nalgebra, all over a field k. Then subcoalgebras of C \u2013 (Sub(C), \u2286), subbialgebras of B \u2013 (Subbi (B), \u2286)\nand sub-Hopf algebras of a Hopf algebra H \u2013 (SubHopf (H), \u2286) are complete lattices which additionally are\nalgebraic and dually algebraic when C, B, H are finitely dimensional.\nThe proof is straightforward and will be omitted. In finite dimensional case the lattices are\nalgebraic and dually algebraic since every element of a lattice of subspaces of a finite dimensional\nvector space is compact.\nLet C be a coalgebra. Let us introduce standard notation: we let coId(C) denote the set of\ncoideals of C, and coIdl (C), coIdr (C) - the sets of left, respectively right, coideals of C. They\nform complete lattice with respect to the inclusion. If C is finite dimensional these lattices are\nalgebraic.\nOne can 'cogenerate' a coideal by a subset Y of a coalgebra C. This is defined as a join of all\nthe coideals contained in Y , i.e. it is the largest coideal contained in Y . We use this notion to\ndefine the meet operation in the poset of coideals. This is dual to the case of algebras where the\njoin is defined as the ideal generated by the set-theoretic sum.\nLemma 2.2. Let C be a coalgebra and I1 , I2 two coideals. Then we have the following formulas for meet\nand join in the lattice of coideals of a coalgebra C:\nI1 \u2228 I2 = I1 + I2 ,\n\nI1 \u2227 I2 = +{I \u2208 coId(C) : I \u2286 I1 \u2229 I2 }.\n\nThe proof is straightforward and is left to the reader. As a direct consequence we get that for\na bialgebra B be or a Hopf algebra H the posets (Idbi (B), \u2286), (IdHopf (H), \u2286) are complete lattices\nwhich in finite dimensional case are algebraic and dually algebraic.\nLet C be a coalgebra, B a bialgebra and H a Hopf algebra. Then we let use the following notation: Quot(C) = {C/I| I is a coideal}, Quot(B) = {B/I| I is a biideal}, Quot(H) =\n{H/I| I is a Hopf ideal}. We define Quotgen (H) as the set of all quotients of H by coideal right\nideal (quotient as a coalgebra and a right H-module).\nQuotgen (H) := {H/I : I coideal right ideal}\nAs a poset it is dually isomorphic to the poset of right ideals coideals of H.\nProposition 2.3. The poset (Quotgen (H), \u0017) is a complete lattice. When H is finite dimensional then\nthis lattice is algebraic and dually algebraic.\n\n5\n\n\f3 Galois connection in Hopf\u2013Galois theory\nIn this section we prove Galois Theory: existence of a Galois connection between lattice of\nsubalgebras and generalised quotients of a Hopf algebra in the case of comodule algebras. In\ngeneral we do not assume that H is finite dimensional.\nDefinition 3.1. Let B \u2286 A be an extension of algebras then by Subalg (B \u2286 A) we denote the lattice of all\nsubalgebras of A which contains B.\nThe defined lattice is an interval in the algebraic lattice of subalgebras of A.\nLemma 3.2. The lattice Subalg (B \u2286 A) is an algebraic lattice.\nThe shortest argument is that Subalg (B \u2286 A) is a lattice of algebras of suitably defined algebra\n(in the sense of Universal Algebra, which has operations of the algebra A and operations which\ncomes from B-module structure). Every lattice of subalgebra of an algebra (in the sense of Universal Algebra) is algebraic, thus the lemma follows.\nDefinition 3.3. Let H be a Hopf algebra, and A an algebra. A is said to be a comodule algebra if it\nis an H-comodule, which structure map is a map of algebras, i.e. there is a coassociative algebra map\n\u03b4:A\nA \u2297 H compatible with the counit of H:\nA\n\n\u03b4\n\nA\u2297H\n\n\u03b4\nA\u2297H\n\nA\n\n\u03b4\n\nA\u2297H\n\n\u03b4 \u2297 id\nid \u2297 \u2206\n\nid \u2297 \u01eb\n\nA\u2297H \u2297H\n\nA\n\nAbove, \u2206 stands for the comultiplication of H and \u01eb is the counit of H. The set\nAco H := {a \u2208 A : \u03b4(a) = a \u2297 1}\nis a subalgebra of A and is called subalgebra of coinvariants.\nDefinition 3.4 (H-extension and Q-Galois extension). Let H be a Hopf algebra, Q \u2208 Quotgen (H) and\nlet A be an H-comodule algebra with the subalgebra of coinvariants B. An intermediate extension of the\nform Aco Q \u2286 A will be called an intermediate H-extension. The poset of all intermediate H-extensions\nwill be denoted as SubH-ext (B \u2286 A). An intermediate H-extension Aco Q \u2286 A will be called Q-Galois if\nthe canonical map:\ncan Q : A \u2297Aco Q A\nA\u2297Q\nis a bijection. The subposet of SubH-ext (B \u2286 A) consisting of all Q-Galois extensions will be denoted by\nSubQ-Galois (B \u2286 A).\nTheorem 3.5 (Galois Theory for H-extensions). Let H be a Hopf algebra over a field k and A be an\nH-comodule algebra then there exists a Galois connection between complete lattices:\n\u03c6\n\nQuotgen (H)\n\nSubalg (A/Aco H )\n\n\u03c8\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03c6(Q) = Aco Q .\nThe map \u03c8 is unique what follows from general statement on Galois connections (Proposition 1.3 (3)).\nApplying Proposition 1.3 (2) we obtain that \u03c6(Quotgen (H)) and \u03c8(Subalg (Aco H \u2286 A)) are dually\nisomorphic posets. Note, that the above statement can be proved in more general context of\ncoactions of coalgebras.\nTo prove Galois Theory we will use the following existence theorem for Galois connections.\n6\n\n\fTheorem 3.6. Suppose that P, Q are posets and moreover P is complete. Then antimonotonic function\n\u03c6:P\nQ is part of a Galois connection if and only if it reflects all suprema into infima.\nThe above theorem is a special case of the P.J. Freyd characterisation theorem of adjoint funcQ is a Galois connection if an only\n\ntors [?, Theorem 2, p.121]. The pair of maps (\u03c6, \u03c8) : P\n\nQop is a covariant adjunction where the category structure is given by: the\nif (\u03c6, \u03c8) : P\nrelation p\u2032 \u2265 p is thought as a morphism from p\u2032 to p.\nFor more on Galois connections we refer to ?, where among other results the above theorem\nis proved2 . Now we are ready to prove Theorem 3.5.\nAco Q reverses suprema, i.e.\n\nProof.

We proceed\nin three steps, first we prove this for A = H, then for A\u2297H and then for any H-comodule algebra\nA. For\nof the Galois\n(2). The case A \u2297\nPnA = H this is equivalent to the existence\nPn\nPconnection\nTH: let\nn\nx = k=1 ak \u2297 hk \u2208 A \u2297 H be such that k=1 ak \u2297 \u2206(hk ) \u2212 k=1 ak \u2297 hk \u2297 1H \u2208 A \u2297 H \u2297 i\u2208I Ii .\nThen we can choose ai such that they are linearly independent.

Our main result of this section states that Q \u2208 Quotgen (H) is closed\nwhenever A/Aco Q is Q-Galois. It follows that if H is finite dimensional then every generalised\nquotient is closed provided A/Aco H has surjective (thus bijective) canonical map. As a corollary\nwe obtain a bijective correspondence between SubH-ext (A/B) and Quotgen (H) for finite dimensional Hopf algebras.\nProposition 4.1. 3 Let A be an H-comodule algebra (both A and H can be infinite dimensional) with\nsurjective canonical map and let A be a Q1 -Galois and a Q2 -Galois extension where Q1 , Q2 \u2208 Quotgen (H).\nThen the following implication holds:\nAco Q1 = Aco Q2 \u21d2 Q1 = Q2\nProof. Let B = Aco Q1 = Aco Q2 then we have the following commutative diagram:\nA \u2297 Q1\ncan Q1\nA \u2297B A\n\nA \u2297Aco H A\ncan Q2\n\nid \u2297 \u03c01\ncan\n\nA\u2297H\nid \u2297 \u03c02\nA \u2297 Q2\n\nThe maps can Q1 and can Q2 are isomorphisms. Let f := (can Q1 \u25e6 can \u22121\nQ2 ) \u25e6 (id \u2297 \u03c02 ), g := (id \u2297 \u03c01 ).\nBy commutativity of the above diagram, f \u25e6 can and g \u25e6 can are equal. Moreover, surjectivity\nof can yields the equality (can Q1 \u25e6 can \u22121\nQ2 ) \u25e6 (id \u2297 \u03c02 ) = (id \u2297 \u03c01 ). It follows that there exists\n\u22121\n\u03c0 : Q1\nQ2 such that can 1 \u25e6 can 2 = id \u2297 \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c02 = \u03c01 . Furthermore, \u03c0 is right H-linear\nand colinear, thus Q2 \u0017 Q1 . In the same way we prove that Q1 \u0017 Q2 (take can 2 \u25e6 can \u22121\n1 instead\nof can 1 \u25e6 can \u22121\n);\nbecause\n\u0017\nis\nan\norder\n(antisymmetry)\nwe\nget\nQ\n=\nQ\n.\n1\n2\n2\nProposition 4.2. If A is an H-comodule algebra with epimorphic canonical map (both A and H can be\ninfinite dimensional) then every Q \u2208 Quotgen (H) for which Aco Q \u2286 A is a Q-Galois extension is a closed\nelement of the Galois connection (10).\nProof. Fix AcoQ for some Q \u2208 Quotgen (H). Then \u03c6\u22121 (Aco Q ) is a non-empty upper-sublattice of\nQuotgen (H) (i.e. it is a subposet closed under finite suprema) which has the greatest element,\ne = \u03c8(Aco Q ). This follows from Theorem 3.5 and properties of Galois connections. The\nnamely Q\ne is the only closed element belonging to \u03c6\u22121 (Aco Q ). Both Q \u2264 \u03c8(Aco Q )\ngeneralised quotient Q\ne is also such. We have the commuand the observation that Aco Q \u2286 A is Q-Galois imply that Q\ntative diagram:\n3 We\n\nwould like to thank P.

It follows that B and Q\nare the corresponding closed elements.\n?, Corollary 3.3 give conditions under which an extension co Q A \u2286 A is a Q-Galois and thus\nwhen it is a closed element of the Galois connection (10). Let us cite it here:\nProposition 4.4 (?, Corollary 3.3). Let H be a Hopf algebra over a ring k with bijective antipode and let\nA be an H-comodule algebra with epimorphic canonical map. Let Q \u2208 Quotgen (H), then it follows that\nin each of the case A/Aco Q is Q-Galois and A is a projective left Aco Q -module:\n(1) k is a field and H is finite dimensional,\n(2) H is finitely generated projective over k, coflat as a right Q-comodule, and the surjection H\nsplits as a left Q-comodule map,\n(3) H has enough right integrals, is coflat as a right Q-comodule, and the surjection H\nas a left Q-comodule map,\n\nQ\nQ splits\n\n(4) k is a field, H is co-Frobenius, and faithfully coflat both as a left and a right Q-comodule,\n(5) H is Q-cleft and Q is finitely generated projective,\n(6) k is a field, H has cocommutative coradical, and Q is finite dimensional and of the form Q =\nH/K + H for a Hopf subalgebra K of H.\nLet us remark that due to ? finite dimensional Hopf algebras have bijective antipode and thus\nit is not needed to assume it in point (1) above. The following theorem is a generalisation of [?,\nTheorem 4.7] which we included in the introduction.\nTheorem 4.5. Let H be a finite dimensional Hopf algebra and let B \u2286 A be an H-Hopf\u2013Galois extension.\nThen every intermediate H-extension is a Q-Galois and there is an anti-isomorphism of posets:\nSubH-ext (B \u2286 A) \u2243 Quotgen (H)\nProof. It follows directly from Proposition 4.2 Proposition 4.4 (1) and Proposition 1.3.\n9\n\n\fRemark 4.6. It follows that intermediate H-extensions form a complete lattice. Moreover, the poset of\nHopf\u2013Galois subextensions is dually isomorphic to the lattice of Hopf algebra quotients of H:\nn\no\nAco H/I \u2286 A : I \u2212 Hopf ideal of H \u2243 Quot(H).\n\nThis corollary implies part of the Galois Theory for finite field extensions (the injectivity of\nthe map Fix : Sub(Gal(E/F))\nSub(E/F)). The main result in finite Hopf\u2013Galois theory \u2013\nTheorem 4.5, shows that there is bijective correspondence with all H-subextensions. The map\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c8 constructed as an adjunction of Q 7\u2192 AcoQ is not given by an explicit formula in terms of the\nHopf algebra structure (it can be expressed using the order structure, see (11)). However, in\nsome important cases: the finite Galois theory, the k \u2286 H H-Hopf\u2013Galois extension and cleft\nextensions we will see an explicit Hopf algebraic formula.\nIn [?, Theorem 2.3] there is proved an extension of Chase\u2013Sweedler theorem for commutative algebras which are comodule algebras over finite dimensional Hopf algebra. Theorem 4.5\nextends this result to non-commutative algebras.\n\n5 Chase\u2013Sweedler Theorem\nAs a direct consequence of Theorem 3.5 we get the Chase\u2013Sweedler Theorem for finite dimensional Hopf algebras.\nDefinition 5.1.

Let A/B be a Galois extension such that it is a Hopf\u2013Galois extension under an action of a finite cocommutative Hopf algebra H. Then the following map is injective and\ninclusion reversing:\nSubHopf (H)\nSubfield (A \u2286 B), H\nAH\nThis theorem follows from Theorem 4.5 and the bijective correspondence between right H-comodule\nstructures and left H \u2217 -module structures on A, assuming that H is finitely dimensional (see [?,\nProposition 6.2.4]). Note that Chase and Sweedler proved this for algebras over rings. Furthermore, they classified H-extensions.\nIn [?, Theorem 2.3] there is proved an extension of Chase\u2013Sweedler theorem for commutative\nalgebras which are comodule algebras over finite dimensional Hopf algebra. Theorem 4.5 also\nextends this result to non-commutative algebras.\n\n6 The H/k-H-extension\nIn the case of an H-Hopf\u2013Galois extension k \u2286 H we show that Theorem 3.5 generalises\nM.

We let Subgen (H) denote the poset of right coideals subalgebras of a Hopf algebra H.\nIf H is commutative then right coideal subalgebras over which H is faithfully flat correspond\nto quotients of Spec(H) by an affine closed subgroup scheme (thus the quotient is affine and a\ntransitive Spec(H)-set). The poset Subgen (H) has all infima, hence it has a unique structure of a\ncomplete lattice.\nProposition 6.3 (?, Proposition 1). Let H be a Hopf algebra and I its left ideal coideal. Then co H/I H\nis a right coideal subalgebra of H. Let K be a right coideal subalgebra of H. Then HK + is a left ideal\ncoideal of H.\nThe following example is known (with the exception of point 2), but the arguments are spread\nin the literature, thus we explain it more carefully.\nExample 6.4.

Furthermore, K = k1 + K + and both maps have the same value on 1 thus they are equal.\n+\nMoreover, K = co H/HK H in the following two cases:\n11\n\n\f1. H is left or right faithfully flat over K [see ?, Remark 1.2],\n2. H is finite dimensional: by [?, Thm. 6.1(ii)] H is free over K thus faithfully flat, now use (1).\n3. Moreover, in these two cases, if K is a normal Hopf subalgebra then HK + = K + H is a normal\nHopf ideal, and if I is a normal Hopf ideal then co H/IH = H co H/I is a normal Hopf subalgebra\nwhat was originally proved by H.-J. Schneider in [?, Lemma 1.3] to show (13).\nIn the second case flatness is necessary as it shows the following example which we cite after ?\n(but used rather for different purposes):\nExample 6.5. Let F1 be the free group with one generator g and M1 its free submonoid generated by\ng. Then the Hopf algebra H = k[F1 ] and its coideal subalgebra K = k[M1 ] are such that HK + =\nHH + , then the above implies that H = K which is false but k[F1 ] is not faithfully flat over k[M1 ]:\nk[Zn ] \u2297k[M1 ] k[F1 ] = 0, where Zn is the group of integers modulo n.\nThe two cases of the preceding Theorem lead us to two new results which positively answers\nthe question raised by ?: is correspondence (12) a bijection without extra assumptions? The above\nexample gives a negative answer to this question, however if H is finite dimensional over a field\nthen (12) is a bijection without faithful flat/coflat assumptions, because they are satisfied for\nevery subobject.\nTheorem 6.6. Let H be a Hopf algebra over a field k. Then k \u2286 H is an H-Hopf\u2013Galois extension and\nthere exists a Galois connection:\n\u001a\n\u001b\nK \u2286 H : K - right coideal subalgebra\n=: Subgen (H)\n\n\u03c8\n\u03c6\n\n\u001a\n\u001b\nH/I : I - left ideal coideal\n=: Quotgen (H)\n\n(15)\n\nwhere (\u03c6(Q) = co Q H, \u03c8(K) = H/HK + ) is the Galois connection4 obtained in Theorem 3.5. Moreover,\nthis Galois correspondence restricts to normal elements:\n\u001a\n\u001b\nK \u2286 H : K - normal Hopf subalgebra\n=: SubnHopf (H)\n\n\u03c8\n\u03c6\n\n\u001a\n\u001b\nH/I : I - normal Hopf ideal\n=: Quotnormal (H)\n\nWe claim that:\n(1) K \u2208 Subgen (H) such, that H is faithfully flat over K, is a closed element of the Galois connection (15).\n(2) Q \u2208 Quotgen (H) such that H is faithfully coflat over Q is a closed element of the Galois connection (15).\n(3) if H is finite dimensional then \u03c6 and \u03c8 are inverse bijections.\nThe above theorem we put it here for the sake of completeness. In the proof we use Proposition 4.1, which might be avoided using P.Schauenburg results (see [?, Theorem 3.10]). Point (1)\ngives an alternative proof of the A. Masuoka's part of Theorem 6.1 observing that H is faithfully flat over a right coideal subalgebra K if and only if H is faithfully coflat over H/HK + (for\nHopf algebra H over a field k). We refer to [?, Proposition 4.5] for the proof of this observation.\nPoint (3) uses the S. Skryabin result [?, Theorem 6.1]. We will also see that the presented method\nwill shed more light in the infinite dimensional case of S. Montgomery question.\n4 Here\n\nwe changed one side of the Galois connection comparing to Theorem 3.5 but it doesn't make a difference.\n\n12\n\n\fProof. Proposition 6.3 shows that both maps \u03c6 and \u03c8 are well defined. Equation (14) shows that\n+\nK \u2286 \u03c6\u03c8(K) = co H/HK H thus to obtain that (\u03c6, \u03c8) is a Galois connection it remains to prove\nthat H/I \u2264 \u03c8\u03c6(H/I) = H/H(co H/IH)+ , i.e. I \u2287 H(co H/IH)+ . Let x \u2208 (co H/IH)+ then\nX\n\u2206(x) = x(1 ) \u2297 x(2 ) = 1 \u2297 x +\nik \u2297 xk\nk\n\nwhere ik \u2208 I, xk \u2208 H, k = 1, . . . , n, thus\nX\nx = 1\u01eb(x) +\nik \u01eb(xk )\n=\n\nX\n\nk\n\nik \u01eb(xk ) \u2208 I\n\nsince x \u2208 ker \u01eb\n\nk\n\nThis Galois connection is the same as (10) in Theorem 3.5, because of the uniqueness of Galois\nmaps (Proposition 1.3 (3)). The minor difference is the codomain of \u03c6: here it is Subgen (H) rather\nthan Subalg (k \u2286 H) as in Theorem 3.5 according to the case A = H. The map \u03c6 restricts to normal elements as shown by ?. In the case of finite dimensional Hopf algebras every Q-extension\nH co Q \u2286 H is Q-Galois (Proposition 4.4). From Proposition 4.2 we get that \u03c6 is a monomorphism\nand so by general properties of Galois connections:\n\u03c8 \u25e6 \u03c6(Q) = H/H(co Q H)+ = Q\nMoreover, in any of the two cases: H is finite dimensional or faithfully flat over K, we have\n\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c8(K) =\n\nco H/HK +\n\nH =K\n\nThus in fact K is closed element of the Galois connection. Point (2) follows from Theorem 6.1.\nIn this setting we can prove inverse of Proposition 4.2, and thus obtain a full characterisation\nof closed elements of Quotgen (H).\nProposition 6.7. Let H be a Hopf algebra. Then Q \u2208 Quotgen (H) is a closed element of the Galois\nconnection (15) if and only if H/ co Q H is a Hopf\u2013Galois extension.\nProof. It is enough to show that if Q is closed then coQ H \u2286 H is an H-Hopf\u2013Galois. If Q is closed\nthen Q = H/H(coQ H)+ . One can show that for any K \u2208 Subgen (H) the following map is an\nisomorphism:\nH \u2297K H\nH/HK + \u2297 H, h \u2297 k\nh(1 ) \u2297 h(2 ) k\n(16)\nIts inverse is given by H/HK + \u2297 H \u220b h\u2297 k\nh(1 ) \u2297 S(h(2 ) )k \u2208 H \u2297K H which is well defined\nbecause \u2206(K) \u2286 K \u2297 H. Plugging K = co Q H to equation (16) we observe that this map is the\ncanonical map of Q. Thus H/ co Q H is a Q-Galois extension.\nCombining the above, Proposition 4.1 and Proposition 1.3(4) we get:\nCorollary 6.8. Let H be a finite Hopf algebra. Then every Q \u2208 Quotgen (H) is Q-Galois.\nFurthermore, the following proposition holds:\nProposition 6.9. Let H be a Hopf algebra. Then there is a bijective correspondence:\n\u001a\n\u001b\nK \u2286 H : K \u2212 right coideal subalgebra\nif and only if\n13\n\n\u2243\n\n\u001a\n\u001b\nH/I : I \u2212 left ideal coideal\n\n\f1. for every its generalised quotient Q the extension co Q H \u2286 H is Q-Galois\n+\n2. co H/K HH \u2286 K for every right coideal subalgebra K of H.\nProof. The pair of maps:\n\u03c8\nSubgen (H)\n\nco Q\n\nK\nH\n\nQuotgen (H)\n\u03c6\n\u03c8\n\u03c6\n\nH/HK +\nQ\n\nis a Galois connection. The Proposition 4.1 and the above result shows that \u03c6 is a monomorphism\nand thus by the Galois property \u03c8\u03c6 = id . In the presence of a Galois correspondence, the equality\n+\n\u03c6\u03c8 = id is equivalent to the inclusion co H/K H H \u2286 K.\n\n7 Cleft extensions\nLet us introduce cleft extensions:\nDefinition 7.1. An H-extension A/B is called cleft if there exists a convolution invertible H-comodule\nmap \u03b3 : H\nA.\nHere we give definition of the normal basis property for H-extensions.\nDefinition 7.2. Let B \u2286 A be an H-extension. Then it has the normal basis property if and only if A is\nisomorphic to B \u2297k H as left B-module and right H-comodule.\n?, Example 8.2.2 shows that an extension of fields has the classical normal basis property if\nand only if it has the above property. There is a characterisation of cleft extensions due to Y. Doi\nand M. Takeuchi ([see also ?]):\nTheorem 7.3 (?). Let B \u2286 A be an H-extension. Then it is cleft if and only if it is a Hopf\u2013Galois\nextension with normal basis property.\nTheorem 6.6 together with Proposition 6.7 yields the following result.\nTheorem 7.4. Let A/B be an H-cleft extension. Then an element Q of Quotgen (H) is closed in the Galois\nconnection (10) if and only if the extension A/AcoQ is Q-Galois. When H is finite dimensional then there\nis a bijective correspondence:\nSubH-ext (A) \u2243 Quotgen (H)\nThe normality condition can be added to both sides as it is done in Theorem 6.6. The first part is\na consequence of Takeuchi characterisation of cleft extensions, the formula \u03c8(B \u2297 K) = H/K + H\nfor B \u2297K \u2286 A = B \u2297H, where K is right ideal subalgebra of H and Proposition 6.7. The bijection\nis a direct consequence of properties of Galois connections and Theorem 6.6(3).\n\n8 BiGalois extensions\nIn this section we show that (left, right) admissible quotients of H and L(A, H) classifies the\nsame subextensions of A.\nIn ? there is constructed a Hopf algebra L(A, H) for a given k \u2286 A H-Hopf\u2013Galois extension\nwith the property that k \u2286 A is (L(A, H), H)-biGalois extension. This construction extends\nthe one given by ? to the non-commutative case. The Hopf algebra L(A, H) is unique up to\nisomorphism. Its underlying algebra is (A \u2297 A)co H (under the codiagonal coaction of H on A \u2297\nA), [see ?, Theorem 3.5] for more details. We only include here relevant parts of the whole Galois\ntheory based on this additional Hopf algebra. For closer acknowledgement we refer the reader\nto the papers of ??? and also the work of ?.\n14\n\n\fDefinition 8.1. We call A/k a L-H-biGalois extension if A is left L comodule algebra, A/k is a left\nL-Hopf\u2013Galois extension and A is a right H-comodule algebra such that A/k is a right H-Hopf\u2013Galois\nextension. Moreover, A is supposed to be L-H-bicomodule so that both coactions commute.\nLet us define notions which plays an important role in a Galois connection between Quotgen (L)\nand SubalgH (A) \u2013 the complete lattice of H-subcomodule algebras of A.\nDefinition 8.2. Fix a coalgebra C and its quotient coalgebra C/I where I is an coideal of C. The quotient\ncoalgebra C/I is right (left) admissible if it is flat over k (thus faithfully flat) and C is right (left) faithfully\ncoflat over C/I. We call a coideal I of C right (left) admissible if C/I is. A bialgebra or Hopf algebra\nquotient is admissible if it is admissible as a coalgebra.\nA subalgebra B of A is right (left) admissible if A is faithfully flat over B as right (left) module. In\nboth cases admissible will mean left and right admissible.\nWe refer to ? for more on admissibility of subalgebras and quotients.\nProposition 8.3 (?, Proposition 3.2 and Theorem 3.6). Let A/k be a faithfully flat L(H, A)-H-biGalois\nextension of a ring k. Then there exists a Galois connection:\nF\n\nQuotgen (L)\n\nI\n\nSubalgH (A)\n\nsuch that F (L/I) = co L/I A and I(B) = (A \u2297B A)co H . If in addition the antipodes of H and L(H, A)\nare bijective then admissible objects are closed elements of the Galois connection (F , I). The bijection\nbetween closed objects restricts to the admissible objects.\nIt is shown in [?, Corollary 3.6] that the antipode of L(A, H) is bijective if the antipode of H is\nbijective and A/k is faithfully flat.\nLet us denote by Aop the opposite algebra to an algebra A (the underlying vector space of Aop\nis the same as A but the multiplication is precomposed with the flip of tensor factors subsequently\ndenoted by \u03c4 ). An opposite bialgebra B op has opposite multiplication and comultiplication (i.e.\n\u2206op := \u03c4 \u25e6 \u2206, \u03bcop = \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c4 ). The opposite bialgebra of a Hopf algebra is a Hopf algebra if and only\nif the antipode is bijective. Then S op = S \u22121 .\nTheorem 8.4. Let H be a Hopf algebra over a field k with bijective antipode. Let A/Aco H be a faithfully flat\nH-Hopf\u2013Galois extension. Then the map of the Galois connection (1) \u03c6 : Quotgen (H)\nSubalg (A/Aco H )\nco Q\nQ 7\u2192 A\nis injective on the set of (right, left) admissible quotients of H and its image is in the set of\n(right, left) admissible subalgebras of A.\nProof. If Q is left admissible (H is faithfully coflat as left Q-comodule) then by [?, Remark 1.4 (2)] A\nis a Q-Galois extension. Moreover, A is faithfully flat as a left Aco Q -module by [?, Theorem 1.4(2)]\nand thus \u03c6(Q) = Aco Q is left admissible. Now if Q is right admissible then Qop is left admissible\nfor H op (Aop is a left H op -Galois extension) and by the same reasoning as in [?, Theorem 1.4\n(2)] we get that Aop is a left faithfully flat Qop -Galois extension. Then A is a right faithfully flat\nQ-Galois extension. Therefore, Aco Q is right admissible. By Proposition 4.1 the map \u03c6 is injective\non the set of (right, left) admissible quotients of H.\nCorollary 8.5. Let k \u2286 A be a L(H, A)-H-biGalois extension of a field k, where H is a Hopf algebra\nwith a bijective antipode. The last two results show:\n(left, right) admissible\nquotients of L(H, A)\n\n\u2243\n\n(left, right) admissible\nH-comodule subalgebras of A\n\u2286\n\n(left, right) admissible\nquotients of H\n\n(left, right) admissible\nsubalgebras of A\n\n15\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank T.
