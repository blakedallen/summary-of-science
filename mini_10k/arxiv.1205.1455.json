Hilali Conjecture predicts that for a simply-connected elliptic space, the total\ndimension of the rational homotopy does not exceed that of the rational homology. Here\nwe give a proof of this conjecture for a class of elliptic spaces known as hyperelliptic.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet X be a simply-connected CW-complex. Then X is said to be of elliptic type if both\ndim H \u2217 (X, Q) < \u221e and dim \u03c0\u2217 (X) \u2297 Q < \u221e. For these spaces, Hilali conjetured in [5] the\nfollowing:\nConjecture 1.1. If X is a simply-connected CW-complex of elliptic type, then\ndim \u03c0\u2217 (X) \u2297 Q \u2264 dim H \u2217 (X, Q) .\nBy the theory of minimal models of Sullivan [3], the rational homotopy type of X is\nencoded in a differential algebra (A, d) called the minimalL\nmodel of X. This is a free graded\nalgebra A = \u039bV , generated by a graded vector space V = k\u22652 V k , and with decomposable\ndifferential, i.e., d : V k \u2192 (\u039b\u22652 V )k+1 . It satisfies that:\nV k = (\u03c0k (X) \u2297 Q)\u2217 ,\n\nH k (\u039bV, d) = H k (X, Q) .\n\nTherefore the Hilali conjecture can be rewritten as follows: for a finite-dimensional graded\nvector space V (in degrees bigger or equal than two), we have\ndim V \u2264 dim H \u2217 (\u039bV, d)\n\nfor any decomposable differential d on \u039bV .\n\nAn elliptic space X is called of pure type if its minimal model (\u039bV, d) satisfies that\nV = V even \u2295 V odd , d(V even ) = 0 and d(V odd ) \u2282 \u039bV even . Also X is called hyperelliptic if\nd(V even ) = 0 and d(V odd ) \u2282 \u039b+ V even \u2297 \u039bV odd .\n\nIn his thesis [5] in 1990, Hilali proved Conjecture 1.1 for elliptic spaces of pure type. The\nconjecture is known to hold [6, 7] also in several cases: H-spaces, nilmanifolds, symplectic\nand cosymplectic manifolds, coformal spaces with only odd-degree generators, and formal\nspaces. Hilali and Mamouni [6, 7] have also proved Conjecture 1.1 for hyperelliptic spaces\nunder various conditions in the homotopical and homological Euler characteristics.\nThe main result of this paper is the following:\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification.

FRES\u00c1N, V. MU\u00d1OZ, AND A. MURILLO\n\nTheorem 1.2. Conjecture 1.1 holds for hyperelliptic spaces.\nWe shall start by proving it for elliptic spaces of pure type in section 3. This requires\nto reduce the question to a problem about Tor functors of certain modules of finite length\nover a polynomial ring. We solve it by using a semicontinuity result for the Tor functor.\nThen in section 4 we prove theorem 1.2 for hyperelliptic spaces. For this we have to prove a\nsemicontinuity result for the homology of elliptic spaces, and apply it to reduce the general\ncase to the case in which the minimal model only has generators of odd degree and zero\ndifferential. We give two different proofs of an inequality from which the result follows.\n2. Minimal models\nWe recall some definitions and results about minimal models [2]. Let (A, d) be a differential algebra, that is, A is a (positively) graded commutative algebra over the rational\nnumbers, with a differential d which is a derivation, i.e., d(a * b) = (da) * b + (\u22121)deg(a) a * (db),\nwhere deg(a) is the degree of a. We say that A is connected if A0 = Q, and simply-connected\nif moreover A1 = 0.\nA simply-connected differential algebra (A, d) is said to be minimal if:\n(1) A is free as an algebra, that is, A is the free algebra \u039bV over a graded vector space\nV = \u2295k\u22652 V k , and\n(2) For x \u2208 V k , dx \u2208 (\u039bV )k+1 has no linear term, i.e., it lives in \u039bV >0 * \u039bV >0 \u2282 \u039bV .\nLet (A, d) be a simply-connected differential algebra. A minimal model for (A, d) is a\nminimal algebra (\u039bV, d) together with a quasi-isomorphism \u03c1 : (\u039bV, d) \u2192 (A, d) (that is,\na map of differential algebras such that \u03c1\u2217 : H \u2217 (\u039bV, d) \u2192 H \u2217 (A, d) is an isomorphism). A\nminimal model for (A, d) exists and it is unique up to isomorphism.\nNow consider a simply-connected CW-complex X. There is an algebra of piecewise\npolynomial rational differential forms (\u03a9\u2217P L (X), d) defined in [3, Chap. VIII]. A minimal\nmodel of X is a minimal model (\u039bVX , d) for (\u03a9\u2217P L (X), d). We have that\nV k = (\u03c0k (X) \u2297 Q)\u2217 ,\n\nH k (\u039bV, d) = H k (X, Q) .\n\nP\nP\nA space X is elliptic [1] if both\ndim \u03c0k (X) \u2297 Q < \u221e and\ndim H k (X, Q) < \u221e.\nEquivalently, if (\u039bV, d) is the minimal model, we require that both V and H \u2217 (\u039bV, d) are\nfinite dimensional. For elliptic spaces, the Euler-Poincar\u00e9 and the homotopic characteristics\nare well defined:\nX\n\u03c7=\n(\u22121)i dim H i (\u039bV, Q),\ni\u22650\n\n\u03c7\u03c0 =\n\nX\ni\u22650\n\n(\u22121)i dim \u03c0i (X) \u2297 Q = dim V even \u2212 dim V odd .\n\nWe refer the reader to [2, Thm. 32.10] for the proof of the following:\nProposition 2.1. Let (\u039bV, d) be an elliptic minimal model. Then \u03c7 \u2265 0 and \u03c7\u03c0 \u2264 0.\nMoreover, \u03c7\u03c0 < 0 if and only if \u03c7 = 0.\n\n\fTHE HILALI CONJETURE\n\n3\n\nIn his thesis [5], M. Hilali conjectured that for elliptic spaces:\ndim \u03c0\u2217 (X) \u2297 Q \u2264 dim H \u2217 (X, Q) .\n\nIn algebraic terms, this is equivalent to\n\ndim V \u2264 dim H \u2217 (\u039bV, d) ,\n\nwhenever (\u039bV, d) is a minimal model with dim V < \u221e. Note that finiteness of both\ndim H \u2217 (X, Q) and dim \u03c0\u2217 (X) \u2297 Q is necessary. Otherwise, one can easily construct counterexamples such as X = S 3 \u2228 S 3 .\n3. Proof of the Hilali conjecture for elliptic spaces of pure type\nA minimal model (\u039bV, d) is of pure type if V = V even \u2295 V odd , with\nd(V even ) = 0,\n\nd(V odd ) \u2282 \u039bV even .\n\nAn elliptic space is of pure type if its minimal model is so. These spaces are widely studied\nin [2, \u00a732]. By proposition 2.1, we have that dim V even \u2212 dim V odd \u2264 0. Let n = dim V even\nand n + r = dim V odd , where r \u2265 0. Write x1 , . . . , xn for the generators of even degree,\nand y1 , . . . , yn+r for the generators of odd degree. Then dxi = 0, and dyj = Pj (x1 , . . . , xn ),\nwhere Pj are polynomials without linear terms.\nIn this section we prove the following:\nTheorem 3.1. The Hilali conjecture holds for elliptic spaces of pure type.\n3.1. Expressing the homology as a Tor functor. To work over nice modules we would\nlike to reorder the generators y1 , . . . , yn+r , so that P1 , . . . , Pn form a regular sequence in\n\u039b(x1 , . . . , xn ). Recall that this means that the image of Pi in \u039b(x1 , . . . , xn )/(P1 , . . . , Pi\u22121 )\nis not a zero divisor, for any i = 1, . . . , n. But this is not possible in general, as shown by\nthe following example.\nExample 3.2. Let V = Qhx1 , x2 , y1 , y2 , y3 i, where deg(x1 ) = 2 and deg(x2 ) = 6. Define a\ndifferential d on \u039bV by\ndy1 = x61 + x22 ,\n\ndy2 = x91 + x32 ,\n\ndy3 = x41 x2 + x1 x22 .\n\nThen (\u039bV, d) is a pure minimal model. It can be proved that is elliptic if and only if there\n4\nexist exact powers of x1 and x2 . This is the case, since 2x10\n1 = d(x1 y1 + x1 y2 \u2212 x2 y3 ) and\n2x42 = d(x22 y1 + x2 y2 \u2212 x51 y3 ). But for the same reason, models (\u039b(x1 , x2 , yi , yj ), d) are not\nelliptic for any choice of indices i, j. This amounts to say that dyi , dyj are not a regular\nsequence in \u039b(x1 , x2 ).\nHowever, Halperin showed in [4, Lemma 8] that pure models always admit a basis\nz1 , . . . , zn+r of V odd such that dz1 , . . . , dzn is a regular sequence in \u039b(x1 , . . . , xn ). This basis\nis not necessarily homogeneous but it is possible to preserve the lower grading induced by\nthe number of odd elements, that is\n(\u039bV )pq = (\u039bV even \u2297 \u039bq V odd )p .\n\nThis grading passes to cohomology and by taking into account the quasi-isomorphisms\n\u223c\n\n(\u039b(x1 , . . . , xn , y1 , . . . , yn+r ), d) \u2212\u2192 (\u039b(x1 , . . . , xn , z1 , . . . , zn+r ), d)\n\u223c\n\n(\u039b(x1 , . . . , xn , z1 , . . . , zn ), d) \u2212\u2192 (\u039b(x1 , . . . , xn )/(dz1 , . . . , dzn ), d)\n\n\f4\n\nJ. FERN\u00c1NDEZ-BOBADILLA, J. FRES\u00c1N, V. MU\u00d1OZ, AND A. MURILLO\n\nwith respect to the lower grading, one deduces that:\nH\u2217 (\u039bV, d) \u223c\n= H\u2217 (\u039b(x1 , . . . , xn )/(dz1 , . . . , dzn ) \u2297 \u039b(zn+1 , . . . , zn+r ), d).\nSo let z1 , . . . , zn+r be a basis such that dz1 , . . . , dzn form a regular sequence. Put Pj = dzj\nfor j = 1, . . . , n + r and consider the module\nM = Q[x1 , . . . , xn ]/(P1 , . . . , Pn )\nover the ring\nR = Q[x1 , . . . , xn ] .\nConsider the ring\nS = Q[\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr ]\nand the map f : S \u2192 R, \u03bbi 7\u2192 Pn+i . Then M becomes an S-module.\nConsider also the S-module\n\nQ0 = S/(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr ).\nThen we have the following:\nProposition 3.3. H\u2217 (\u039bV, d) \u223c\n= Tor\u2217S (M, Q0 ).\nProof. Let U = hz1 , . . . , zn i, W = hzn+1 , . . . , zn+r i so that V odd = U \u2295 W . Then the map\n(\u039bV even \u2295 U, d) \u2192 (M, 0) is a quasi-isomorphism. Actually, the Koszul complex\nR \u2297 \u039bn U \u2192 R \u2297 \u039bn\u22121 U \u2192 . . . \u2192 R \u2297 \u039b1 U \u2192 R \u2192 M\n\u223c\n\nis exact, which means that (R \u2297 \u039bU, d) \u2212\u2192 (M, 0).\nTherefore\n\n(1)\n\n\u223c\n\n(\u039bV, d) = (R \u2297 \u039bU \u2297 \u039bW, d) \u2212\u2192 (M \u2297 \u039bW, d\u2032 ) ,\n\nis an isomorphism, where the differential d\u2032 is defined as zero on M , and d\u2032 zn+i = P\u0304n+i \u2208 M .\nThis can be seen as follows: the map (1) is a map of differential algebras. Grading both\nalgebras in such a way that \u039bk W has degree k, we get two spectral sequences. The map\nbetween their E1 -terms is\nH \u2217 (R \u2297 \u039bU, d) \u2297 \u039bW \u2192 M \u2297 \u039bW .\nAs this is an isomorphism, it follows that the map in the E\u221e -terms is also an isomorphism.\nThe E\u221e -terms are the homology of both algebras in (1). So the map (1) is an isomorphism.\nFinally, we have to identify H \u2217 (M \u2297 \u039bW, d\u2032 ) \u223c\n= Tor\u2217S (M, Q0 ). Note that the homology of\n\u2032\n(M \u2297 \u039bW, d ) is computed as follows: take the Koszul complex\nS \u2297 \u039br W \u2192 S \u2297 \u039br\u22121 W \u2192 . . . \u2192 S \u2297 \u039b1 W \u2192 S \u2192 Q0 ,\n\nand tensor it with M over S (with the S-module structure given above), to get\n(M \u2297S (S \u2297 \u039bW ), d\u2032 ) = (M \u2297 \u039bW, d\u2032 ).\n\nThe homology of this computes Tor\u2217S (M, Q0 ).\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 3.4.

Semicontinuity theorem. We are going to prove a semicontinuity theorem for the\nTor functors TorkS (M, Q0 ) for flat families of modules M of finite length (i.e., finite-dimensional\nas Q-vector spaces).\nConsider a variable t. A family of S-modules is a module M over S[t] such that for each\nt0 , the S-module\nMt0 = M/(t \u2212 t0 )\n\nis of finite length. We say that M is flat over Q[t] if it is a flat Q[t]-module, under the\ninclusion Q[t] \u0592\u2192 S[t]. Consider M as a Q[t]-module.

The module is flat if and only if there is no torsion\nt\u2212t\npart, i.e., l = 0 (to see this, tensor the exact sequence 0 \u2192 Q[t] \u2212\u2192i Q[t] \u2192 Q[t]/(t \u2212 ti ) \u2192 0\nwith M). Note that for generic \u03be, length(M\u03be ) = N . Therefore the flatness is equivalent to\nM/(t \u2212 ti ) being of length N , i.e.,\nM is flat \u21d0\u21d2 length(Mt ) = N, \u2200t .\nLemma 3.5. For any flat family M,\ndim TorkS (M0 , Q0 ) \u2265 dim TorkS (M\u03be , Q0 ),\nfor generic \u03be \u2208 Q.\nProof. Let us resolve M as a S[t]-module:\n(3)\n\n0 \u2192 S[t]ar \u2192 . . . \u2192 S[t]a0 \u2192 M \u2192 0 .\n\n\f6\n\nJ. FERN\u00c1NDEZ-BOBADILLA, J. FRES\u00c1N, V. MU\u00d1OZ, AND A. MURILLO\nt\n\nAs M is flat as Q[t]-module, if we tensor the inclusion Q[t] \u0592\u2192 Q[t] by M over Q[t], we\nt\n\nhave that M \u0592\u2192 M is an inclusion. Hence the sequence\nt\n\n0 \u2192 M \u0592\u2192 M \u2192 M/(t) \u2192 0\nis exact. But this sequence is the sequence 0 \u2192 S[t] \u2192 S[t] \u2192 S[t]/(t) \u2192 0 tensored by\nM over S[t]. Hence Tor1S[t] (M, S[t]/(t)) = 0. Obviously TorjS[t] (M, S[t]/(t)) = 0 for j \u2265 2\n(since the resolution S[t]/(t) has two terms).\nUsing the above, we can tensor (3)\u2297S[t] S[t]/(t) to get an exact sequence:\n0 \u2192 S ar \u2192 . . . \u2192 S a0 \u2192 M0 \u2192 0 .\n\n(4)\n\nNow we tensor (4) by \u2297S Q0 and take homology to obtain Tor\u2217S (M0 , Q0 ). But\n(4) \u2297S Q0 = (3) \u2297S[t] Q0 = ((3) \u2297S[t] Q[t]) \u2297Q[t] Q[t]/(t) = (5) \u2297Q[t] Q[t]/(t) ,\nwhere Q0 = S[t]/(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr , t), and\n0 \u2192 Q[t]ar \u2192 . . . \u2192 Q[t]a0 \u2192 F = M/(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr ) \u2192 0.\n\n(5)\n\n(This is just a complex, maybe not exact.) Analogously,\nTor\u2217S (M0 , Q\u03be ) = H \u2217 ((5) \u2297Q[t] Q[t]/(t \u2212 \u03be)) .\nSo it remains to see that for a complex L\u2022 of free Q[t]-modules like (5), it holds that\ndim H k (L\u2022 \u2297 Q[t]/(t \u2212 \u03be)) \u2264 dim H k (L\u2022 \u2297 Q[t]/(t)),\nfor generic \u03be. (Tensor products are over Q[t], which we omit in the notation henceforth.)\nFor proving this, just split (5) as short exact sequences\n(6)\n\n0 \u2192 Zi \u2192 Li \u2192 Bi\u22121 \u2192 0,\n\nand note that Zi , Bi are free Q[t]-modules, being submodules of free modules. So Zi = Q[t]zi\nand Bi = Q[t]bi . Now 0 \u2192 Bi \u2192 Zi \u2192 H i (L\u2022 ) \u2192 0 gives that\nH i (L\u2022 ) = Q[t]zi \u2212bi \u2295 torsion.\n\nFor generic \u03be, we have dim H i (L\u2022 \u2297 Q[t]/(t \u2212 \u03be)) = zi \u2212 bi . Hence\n0 \u2192\n\nZi \u2297 Q[t]/(t)\n\u2192 Li \u2297 Q[t]/(t) \u2192\nBi\u22121 \u2297 Q[t]/(t)\n\u2192 0\n\u2193\n||\n\u2193\n0 \u2192 Zi (L\u2022 \u2297 Q[t]/(t)) \u2192 Li \u2297 Q[t]/(t) \u2192 Bi\u22121 (L\u2022 \u2297 Q[t]/(t)) \u2192 0 .\n\nThe first sequence is (6) tensored by Q[t]/(t). Thus the last vertical map is surjective, and\nthe first vertical map is injective.\nTherefore, we get:\ndim H i (L\u2022 \u2297 Q[t]/(t)) = dim Zi (L\u2022 \u2297 Q[t]/(t)) \u2212 dim Bi (L\u2022 \u2297 Q[t]/(t))\n\u2265 dim Zi \u2297 Q[t]/(t) \u2212 dim Bi \u2297 Q[t]/(t)\nQ[t]\n\n= dim H i (L\u2022 ) \u2297 Q[t]/(t) \u2212 dim Tor1 (H i (L\u2022 ), Q[t]/(t))\n= zi \u2212 bi ,\nwhere we have used in the third line that there is an exact sequence\nQ[t]\n\n0 \u2192 Tor1 (H i (L\u2022 ), Q[t]/(t)) \u2192 Bi \u2297 Q[t]/(t) \u2192 Zi \u2297 Q[t]/(t) \u2192 H i (L\u2022 ) \u2297 Q[t]/(t) \u2192 0,\n\n\fTHE HILALI CONJETURE\n\n7\n\nQ[t]\n\nand in the fourth line that dim(N \u2297 Q[t]/(t)) = dim Tor1 (N, Q[t]/(t)) for a torsion Q[t]module N .\n\u0003\n3.3. Proof of theorem 3.1. We proceed to the proof of the Hilali conjecture for elliptic\nspaces of pure type. We have to prove that\ndim H \u2217 (\u039bV, d) \u2265 2n + r.\n\nBy proposition 3.3, we need to prove that dim Tor\u2217S (M, Q0 ) \u2265 2n + r. Consider the family\nM=\n\nQ[t, x1 , . . . , xn ]\n.\n(P1 + tx1 , . . . , Pn + txn )\n\nFor small t, the hypersurfaces P1 + tx1 , . . . , Pn + txn intersect in N points near the origin\naccounted with multiplicity, where N = length(M ). Therefore M is a flat family. By lemma\n3.5, it is enough to bound below dim Tor\u2217S (M\u03be , Q0 ). But for generic t, the hypersurfaces\nP1 + tx1 , . . . , Pn + txn intersect in N distinct points (at least, it is clear that they intersect\nin several points and the origin is isolated of multiplicity one). Therefore\nTorkS (M\u03be , Q0 ) = TorkS (Q0 , Q0 ) .\n\u0001\nThis is easily computed to have dimension kr (using the Koszul complex). So, using also\nlemma 3.4,\ndim Tor\u2217S (M, Q0 )\n\n\u2265 (n + 1) +\n\u2265 2n + 2 +\n= 2n + 2 +\n\nr\u22121\nX\n\ndim TorkS (M, Q0 ) + (n + 1)\n\nk=1\nr\u22121\nX\n\ndim TorkS (M\u03be , Q0 )\n\nk=1\n\nr\u22121 \u0012 \u0013\nX\nr\nk=1\n\nk\n\n= 2n + 2r \u2265 2n + r .\n\nRemark 3.6. The above computation works for r \u2265 1. If r = 0 then we have to prove that\nlength(M ) \u2265 2n. But\u0001then computing the degree 2 non-zero elements in M , we have that\n\u2212 n.

Note that elliptic spaces of pure\ntype are in particular hyperelliptic.\nBy proposition 2.1 we have that dim V even \u2212dim V odd \u2264 0. Let n = dim V even and n+r =\ndim V odd , where r \u2265 0. Write x1 , . . . , xn for the generators of even degree, and y1 , . . . , yn+r\nfor the generators of odd degree. Then dxi = 0, and dyj = Pj (x1 , . . . , xn , y1 , . . . , yj\u22121 ),\nwhere Pj do not have linear terms.\nIn this section we prove the following:\n\n\f8\n\nJ. FERN\u00c1NDEZ-BOBADILLA, J.

Let (\u039bV, d) be a hyperelliptic minimal model. Then\ndim H(\u039bV, d) \u2265 2r .\nProof. Write as usual x1 , . . . , xn for generators of X = V even and y1 , . . . , yn+r for generators\nof Y = V odd . When we apply the previous lemma to morphisms Q\u2190\u2212\u039bX\u0592\u2192\u039bV we get a\nspectral sequence:\nE2 = H(\u039bV, d) \u2297 Tor\u2217\u039bX (Q, Q) \u21d2 Tor\u2217\u039bX (\u039bV, Q).\nOn the one hand,\nTor\u2217\u039bX (Q, Q) = H \u2217 (\u039b(x1 , ..., xn ), 0) = \u039b(x1 , . . . , xn ),\n\n\fTHE HILALI CONJETURE\n\n11\n\n\u223c\n\nwhere \u039b(x1 , ..., xn , x1 , ..., xn ) \u2212\u2192 Q is a semifree resolution of Q regarded as \u039bX-module.\nHence xi are all of odd degree.\nOn the other hand, \u039bV is already \u039bX-semifree, so:\nTor\u2217\u039bX (\u039bV, Q) = H(\u039bV \u2297\u039bX Q) = H \u2217 (\u039b(y1 , ..., yn+k ), 0) = \u039b(y1 , ..., yn+k ).\nThen the inequality\ndim H \u2217 (\u039bV, d) * dim Tor\u2217\u039bX (Q, Q) \u2265 dim Tor\u2217\u039bX (\u039bV, Q)\ncoming from the spectral sequence translates into\n2n dim H \u2217 (\u039bV, d) \u2265 2n+r ,\nso the result follows.\n\n\u0003\n\n4.4. Proof of theorem 4.1. Now we prove the inequality dim H(\u039bV, d) \u2265 2n + r, for the\nhyperelliptic minimal model.\nIf r = 0, then \u03c7\u03c0 = 0. So [2, Prop. 32.10] says that the model is pure, and this case is\nalready covered by remark 3.6.\nIf r > 0, then \u03c7\u03c0 < 0. So by proposition 2.1, \u03c7 = 0, and hence it is enough to prove that\ndim H even (\u039bV, d) \u2265 n + 2r .\nSuppose that r = 1, 2. As the degree 0 and degree 1 elements give always non-trivial\nhomology classes, then dim H even (\u039bV, d) \u2265 n + 1, and we are done.\n\nSo we can assume r \u2265 3. We use the following fact: if P (x) is a quadratic polynomial on\nthe x, and P (x) = d\u03b1, \u03b1 \u2208 \u039bV , then \u03b1 must be linear, \u03b1 \u2208 V odd and denoting by do the\ncomposition\nV odd \u2212\u2192 \u039b+ V even \u2297 \u039bV odd \u0589 \u039b+ V even ,\n\u0001\nwe have P (x) = do \u03b1. So there are at least n+1\n\u2212 (n + r) quadratic terms in the homology.\n2\nConjecture 1.1 is proved if\n\u001a\n\u0001\neither 1 + n + n+1\n\u2212 (n + r) \u2265 n + 2r ,\n2\n(10)\nr\nor 2 \u2265 2n + r .\nSo now assume that (10) does not hold. Then\n(11)\n\nand 1 +\n\nn+1\u0001\n2\n\n\u2212 n < 23 r, i.e.,\n\n2r \u2212 r \u2264 2n \u2212 1 ,\n\n(2n \u2212 1)2 \u2264 12r \u2212 11.\n\u221a\n\u221a\nPutting together (11) and (12), we get 2r \u2212 r \u2264 12r \u2212 11, i.e., 2r \u2264 r + 12r \u2212 11. This\nis easily seen to imply that r \u2264 3. So r = 3 and n = 3.\n(12)\n\nThere remains to deal with the case n = 3, r = 3, and do is an isomorphism of the\nodd degree elements onto \u039b2 V even . Let x1 , x2 , x3 be the even degree generators, of degrees\nd1 \u2264 d2 \u2264 d3 respectively. The degrees of x21 , x1 x2 , x22 , x1 x3 , x2 x3 , x23 are the six numbers\n2d1 \u2264 d1 + d2 \u2264 2d2 ,\nWe have two cases:\n\nd1 + d3 \u2264 d2 + d3 \u2264 2d3 .\n\n\f12\n\nJ. FERN\u00c1NDEZ-BOBADILLA, J. FRES\u00c1N, V. MU\u00d1OZ, AND A. MURILLO\n\n\u2022 Case 2d2 \u2264 d1 + d3 . We can arrange the odd generators y1 , . . . , y6 with increasing degree and so that do y1 = x21 , do y2 = x1 x2 , do y3 = x22 , do y4 = x1 x3 , do y5 =\nx2 x3 , do y6 = x23 . Clearly, dy1 = x21 . Then dy2 = x1 x2 + P (x1 ), where P (x1 ) is a\npolynomial on x1 , i.e., of the form cxn1 , n \u2265 2. But this can absorbed by a change\nof variables y2 7\u2192 y2 \u2212 cx1n\u22122 y1 . So we can write dy2 = x1 x2 . Now the even-degree\nclosed elements in \u039b(x1 , x2 , x3 , y1 , y2 ) are again polynomials on x1 , x2 , x3 . So we\ncan assume dy3 = x22 as before. Continuing the computation, the even-degree closed\nelements in \u039b(x1 , x2 , x3 , y1 , y2 , y3 ) are either polynomials on the xi 's or a multiple\nof the element x22 y1 y2 \u2212 x1 x2 y1 y3 + x21 y2 y3 = d(y1 y2 y3 ), which is exact. So we can\nagain manage to arrange that dy4 = x1 x3 .\n\u2022 Case 2d2 > d1 +d3 . Then we have that do y3 = x1 x3 and do y4 = x22 . As before, we can\narrange dy3 = x1 x3 . Now the even-degree closed elements in \u039b(x1 , x2 , x3 , y1 , y2 , y3 )\nare polynomials on the xi 's or a multiple of x3 y1 y2 \u2212 x2 y1 y3 + x1 y2 y3 . But this\nelement has degree 3d1 + d2 + d3 \u2212 2 > 2d2 , so it must be dy4 = x22 .\n\nIn either case, dy1 , dy2 , dy3 , dy4 are x21 , x1 x2 , x22 and x1 x3 . Let us assume that we are in\nthe first case to carry over the notation.\n\nNow we compute the even-degree closed elements in \u039b(x1 , x2 , x3 , y1 , y2 , y3 , y4 ). These are\npolinomials on xi 's or combinations of\nx22 y1 y2 \u2212 x1 x2 y1 y3 + x21 y2 y3 = d(y1 y2 y3 ),\nx3 y 1 y 2 \u2212 x2 y 1 y 4 + x1 y 2 y 4 ,\n\nx1 x3 y2 y3 \u2212 x22 y2 y4 + x1 x2 y3 y4 = d(y2 y3 y4 ), and\n\nx1 x3 y1 y3 + x21 y3 y4 \u2212 x22 y1 y4 = d(y1 y3 y4 ).\n\nOnly the second one is non-exact, but its degree is strictly bigger thatn d2 + d3 . So again\nwe can arrange that dy5 = x2 x3 .\nFinally, the minimal model is:\n\uf8f1\ndy1 = x21 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ndy = x1 x2 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 2\ndy3 = x22 ,\ndy4 = x1 x3 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ndy\n\uf8f4\n5 = x2 x3 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\ndy6 = x23 + P (xi , yj ).\n\nThe even-degree closed elements in \u039b(x1 , x2 , x3 , y1 , y2 , y3 , y4 , y5 ) contain at least\n\u03b11 = x3 y2 y3 + x1 y3 y5 \u2212 x2 y2 y5 ,\n\u03b12 = x3 y1 y2 \u2212 x2 y1 y4 + x1 y2 y4 .\n\nAt most one of them does not survive in H(\u039bV, d), so proving the existence of at least\nanother even-degree cohomology class. Hence dim H(\u039bV, d) \u2265 10 \u2265 9, as required.\nReferences\n[1] Y. F\u00e9lix, La dichotomie elliptique-hyperbollique en homotopie rationnelle, Ast\u00e9risque 176 (1989).\n[2] Y.
