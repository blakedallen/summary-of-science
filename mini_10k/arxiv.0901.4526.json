Motivated by a problem in complex dynamics, we examine the\nblock structure of the natural action of iterated monodromy groups on the\ntree of preimages of a generic point. We show that in many cases, including\nwhen the polynomial has prime power degree, there are no large blocks other\nthan those arising naturally from the tree structure.

This example settles a problem raised in a recent paper of the second author regarding\nconstant weighted sums of polynomials in the complex plane. We also show\nthat degree 6 is exceptional in another regard, as it is the lowest degree for\nwhich the monodromy group of a polynomial is not determined by the combinatorics of the post-critical set. These results give new applications of iterated\nmonodromy groups to complex dynamics.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet G be a subgroup of the permutation group of a finite set S. A subset E \u2282 S\nis called a G-block if for every permutation \u03c3 \u2208 G we have that \u03c3(E) \u2229 E is equal\nto either E or \u2205. Motivated by a problem in a recent paper [9] of the second author\nwe study G-blocks for monodromy groups of polynomial iterates. These groups are\nnatural finite quotients of the iterated monodromy group of the given polynomial.\nThe latter have attracted attention mainly for their group-theoretic interest (see\ne.g. [1], [2], [6], [4]), and to a lesser extent for the light they shed on the dynamics\nof the given polynomial (e.g. [5, Chapter 6]). The results of the present paper give\na new application of iterated monodromy groups to complex dynamics, as well as\nresults on their structure. We remark that little remains known in general about\niterated monodromy groups; see [7] for some general discussion and open questions.\nThe monodromy group M Gn (f ) of the nth iterate f \u25e6n of a complex polynomial\nf acts by definition on the set Rn of nth preimages of a generic point. Indeed, this\naction extends to one on the tree of preimages of all iterates up to n. The primary\ngoal of the present paper is to show that for many, indeed in some sense most, f\nthere are no large M Gn (f )-blocks other than those coming from the tree structure.\nHere is a special case of our main results in this vein (Theorems 4.1 and 4.3):\nTheorem 1.1. Let f \u2208 C[x] have degree d \u2265 2, f \u25e6n be the nth iterate of f , and\nlet the monodromy group M Gn (f ) of f \u25e6n act naturally on set Rn of nth preimages\nKey words and phrases.

Suppose that either d is prime or M G(f ) acts primitively (i.e.\nwithout non-trivial blocks) on R1 . If E \u2286 Rn is any set containing a, b such that\nf \u25e6n\u22121 (a) 6= f \u25e6n\u22121 (b), then the smallest M Gn (f )-block of Rn containing E is Rn\nitself.\nWe also prove a result on the structure of M Gn (f )-blocks in the case where d is\na power of a prime (Theorem 4.1).\nOur other primary goal is to find polynomials f whose monodromy groups have\nexceptional properties, such as Rn containing small M Gn (f )-blocks not coming\nfrom the tree structure. To do this, we give a method for constructing examples\nof critically finite f with specified critical portrait (and often even specified monodromy groups of all iterates). The method relies on building real graphs with\ncertain properties, and gives polynomials with real coefficients. For instance, in\nTheorem 4.6 we give a polynomial h of degree 6 such that R2 contains an M G2 (f )block of size 4 containing a and b with h(a) 6= h(b).\nA more detailed outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we discuss how\nthe monodromy group of a polynomial f depends on the critical portrait of f ,\nthat is, the orbits c \u2192 f (c) \u2192 f \u25e62 (c) \u2192 * * * of the critical points of f . There\nwe only look at the monodromy group of the first iterate and we show (Theorem\n2.1 and Theorem 2.2) that 6 is the smallest degree for which the critical portrait\nof a polynomial does not determine the monodromy group up to conjugacy. In\nfact we give two explicit polynomials of degree 6 with real coefficients and identical\ncritical orbit but whose monodromy groups are not isomorphic. The method of\nconstruction is used also in Section 4. In Section 3 we fix notation and give a few\ndefinitions.\nIn Section 4 we prove the main results of this paper. We first show (Theorem 4.1)\nthat if f is a polynomial whose degree is prime then the only M Gn (f )-blocks are\nbranches, and when the degree of f is a power of a prime then the only M Gn (f )blocks are unions of equal-height branches, contained in a branch of height one\nmore. Motivated by this result we call such blocks basic blocks; see Definition 3.1.\nWe then show (Theorem 4.3) that if M G1 (f ) acts primitively on R1 , then any\nM Gn (f )-block containing elements that map to distinct members of R1 must be\nall of Rn . We apply this to the case where f is a conservative polynomial, i.e. all\ncritical points are also fixed points, and f has at least two critical points (Corollary\n4.4).\nThen we show (Theorem 4.6) that there exist polynomials of non-prime-power\ndegree for which there are blocks that are not basic blocks. In fact, we give an\nexplicit example of a degree 6 polynomial which has M G2 (f )-blocks that are nonbasic. This polynomial is quite similar to the examples used in the proof of Theorem\n2.2.\nIn general it can be quite complicated to compute (iterated) monodromy groups\nof polynomials. However the polynomial examples presented in this paper have\ntwo properties in common that make it much easier to compute their monodromy\ngroups. Firstly the post-critical sets are finite, which means that only a finite\nnumber of generators have to be considered. Secondly, the post-critical sets are\nreal, which means that the action of the generators can be determined by looking\nonly at the real graph of the polynomials.\nLet us finish the introduction by discussing the motivation for this paper. In [9]\nthe following definition was introduced:\n\n\fBLOCKS OF MONODROMY GROUPS\n\n3\n\nDefinition 1.2. A polynomial f has a constant weighted sum of iterates (c.w.s.i.)\nnear z \u2208 C if there exist weights a0 , a1 , . . . \u2208 C and a constant c \u2208 C such that the\nfinite sums\nN\nX\nan f \u25e6n\nn=0\n\nconverge uniformly to the constant function c in a neighborhood of z as N \u2192 \u221e.\nPN\nThe requirement that the maps n=0 an f \u25e6n converge to the same constant for\nany point in the neighborhood of z is very strong and one would not expect convergence to a constant to be possible for many values of z. The only cases in which\nit is known that f has a constant weighted sum of iterates near z is when f is\naffine or when z lies in a Siegel disc of f . Indeed, it was shown in [9] that a generic\npolynomial f of degree at least 2 has a c.w.s.i. near z if and only if z lies in a Siegel\ndisc of f .\nThe proof of this result relies on the fact that the monodromy groups of the\niterates of a generic polynomial (a polynomial whose iterates f \u25e6n each have the\nmaximal number of distinct critical values) are equal to the entire group of tree\nautomorphisms. In general the monodromy groups of the iterates may be much\nsmaller but in many cases the monodromy groups can still be used to prove the\nsame result. In fact, if the following question can be answered affirmatively then it\nstill follows that a polynomial of degree at least 2 has a c.w.s.i near z if and only if\nz lies in a Siegel disc:\nQuestion 1.3. Let f be a polynomial of degree at least 2 and let V be a bounded\nFatou component of f that is eventually mapped onto a periodic (super-) attracting\nbasin or attracting petal. Let N \u2208 N.\nIn the case of an attracting basin or attracting petal, let p \u2208 F \u25e6N (V ) have dN\ndistinct pre-images and define the sets S = f \u25e6\u2212N ({p}) and E = S \u2229 V . In the case\nof a super-attracting basin, let U \u2282 f \u25e6N (V ) be an arbitrarily small neighborhood\nof the super-attracting periodic point in f \u25e6N (V ). Let p \u2208 U again have dN distinct\npre-images and define S = f \u25e6\u2212N (p) as before. Now E \u2282 S contains only points\nthat lie in one chosen connected component of f \u25e6\u2212N (U ) in V .\nIs it possible to choose N such that the smallest M G(f \u25e6N )-block of S that\ncontains E has more than dN \u22121 elements?\nThe orbit of a periodic Fatou component that is a (super-) attracting basin or an\nattracting petal must always contain a critical point. The integer N can be chosen\nsuch that f N (V ) contains the corresponding critical value. As was explained in\n[9], we may assume that the neighborhood U of z in Definition 1.2 is large enough\nso that f \u25e6N (U ) contains the critical value. It follows that when p is chosen close\nenough to this critical value, the set E will contain two points e1 , e2 with the\nproperty that f \u25e6N \u22121 (e1 ) 6= f \u25e6N \u22121 (e2 ). In the terminology of section 3, the points\ne1 and e2 belong to different major branches.\nTheorems 4.1 and 4.3 say that we can answer Question 1.3 affirmatively when\nthe degree of f is a power of a prime number or when M G(f ) acts primitively on\nthe roots of f , but negatively for certain polynomials of degree 6. We obtain the\nfollowing corollary.\nCorollary 1.4. Suppose that f is a polynomial with complex coefficients, and that\neither f has degree pk with p prime, or M G(f ) acts primitively on the f -preimages\n\n\f4\n\nJONES AND PETERS\n\nof a generic point. Then f has a constant weighted sum of iterates near z \u2208 C if\nand only if z is eventually mapped into a Siegel disc of f .\nThe negative answer to Question 1.3 only closes off one avenue of proof when\nf has degree 6. It does not imply that it is possible to have a constant weighted\nsum of iterates when z does not lie in a Siegel disc. Whether this can occur for a\npolynomial of degree at least 2 is still open.\n2. Combinatorics of the post-critical set\nLet f be a polynomial of degree d. Denote by C the set of critical points of\nf , and V the set of critical values of f , that is, V = {f (c) : c \u2208 C}. Then\nf : C r C \u2192 C r V is a covering, and if p \u2208 C has d distinct inverse images, then\nevery closed loop at p contained in C r V induces a permutation on the inverse\nimages of p. The subgroup of Sd thus obtained is independent of the point p and is\ncalled the monodromy group of f , denoted M G(f ). Let f \u25e6n denote the nth iterate\nof f (i.e. the n-fold composition of f with itself). We denote by M Gn (f ) the\nmonodromy group of f \u25e6n . It is not a general subgroup of Sdn , as it must respect\nthe natural tree structure on preimages of p under f (see Section 3 for details).\nThe critical portrait (namely the number and multiplicity of the critical values)\nof a polynomial f gives us a large amount of information about the monodromy\ngroups of f \u25e6n . For example, let v be a critical value of a polynomial f of degree d,\nand denote the inverse images of v by z1 , . . . zn . A small enough neighborhood U\nof v will have n disconnected inverse images V1 , . . . , Vn with zj \u2208 vj . Let \u03b3 \u2208 U be\na closed loop at p \u2208 U given by a circle centered at v. Then the inverse images of\n\u03b3 lie in the sets V1 , . . . , Vn . If zj is a critical point of f with order k then \u03b3 induces\na full cycle on the k preimages of p in Vj .\nIf \u03b3 is a closed loop given by a circle centered at the origin of large enough radius\nthen it induces a full cycle. Indeed, if the radius of \u03b3 is larger than the modulus\nof all the (finite) critical points then we can view it as a loop around the point at\ninfinity, a critical point of order equal to the degree of the map.\nTheorem 2.1. The monodromy group of a polynomial of degree at most 5 is completely determined by its critical portrait, that is, the number and multiplicity of its\ncritical values.\nProof. This is merely a case of checking all possibilities. We will do so for degree 5\nand leave the smaller degrees to the reader.\nSince the degree is prime and M G(f ) is transitive, it must be a primitive subgroup of S5 . It is well known (see e.g. [11]) that if G is a primitive subgroup of Sn\nthat contains a transposition, then G = Sn , while if G contains a 3-cycle, then G\ncontains An . Thus if f has a critical value that is the image of a single critical point\nof multiplicity 2, then M G(f ) = Sn . Otherwise, by the Riemann-Hurwitz formula,\nf must have either one or two critical values. In the former case, M G(f ) has only\none generator and thus M G(f ) \u223c\n= C5 . In the latter case, each critical value must\neither be the image of one critical point of multiplicity 3 or two critical points of\nmultiplicity 2. Thus M G(f ) may be generated by (i) two 3-cycles, (ii) one 3-cycle\nand one element of type (2, 2) or (iii) two elements of type (2, 2). In all three cases\nwe have M G(f ) \u2286 A5 , and for (i) and (ii) we have that M G(f ) contains a 3-cycle,\nand so M G(f ) = A5 . In case (iii) after conjugation we may assume the generators\nare (12)(34) and (23)(45) and we obtain M G(f ) \u223c\n\u0003\n= D5 .\n\n\fBLOCKS OF MONODROMY GROUPS\n\n5\n\nIn degree 6 the situation is more complicated:\nTheorem 2.2. There exist polynomials f, g of degree 6 with identical critical portraits but different monodromy groups. Moreover, one can choose f and g to have\nreal coefficients.\nRemark 2.3. One can provide a short proof of Theorem 2.2 using the Riemann Existence Theorem (see [3] for an exposition), which guarantees that there is f \u2208 C[z]\nof degree 6 with M G(f ) = h(23)(45), (34), (12)(56)i 6= S6 , and g \u2208 C[z] of degree\n6, with identical critical portrait to f and M G(g) = h(23)(45), (12), (34)(56)i = S6 .\nHowever, the Riemann Existence Theorem is non-constructive, and for our purposes\nit will be advantageous to have an explicit method to find such f and g, since in\nTheorem 4.6 we need to construct a polynomial whose second iterate has prescribed\nmonodromy. In addition, the Riemann Existence Theorem does not guarantee that\nf and g can be chosen to have real coefficients.\nProof. We construct f and g explicitly. Both have 5 distinct critical points that all\nlie on the real line. By choosing our base point also on the real line and choosing\nour generator loops close to the real line we can use the real graphs of f and g to\ndetermine the monodromy groups. For both f and g, two critical points map to\na third critical point, and this third critical point gets mapped to a fourth critical\npoint which is a fixed point. The fifth critical point is also fixed. Therefore the\ncritical portraits of f and g are identical.\n\np\n\nx1\n\nx2\n\nx4\n\nx3\n\n0\n!0\n\n1\n!1\n\nx5\n\nx6\n\n2\n\np\n\n!2\n\nFigure 1. Real graph of f and generators of the corresponding\nfundamental group.\nWe now describe f . Its critical points are 0, c1 , 1, c2 and 2, where 0 < c1 < 1 <\nc2 < 2, f (c1 ) = f (c2 ) = 2, f (0) = f (2) = 0 and f (1) = 1. This guarantees that\n\n\f6\n\nJONES AND PETERS\n\nf has the critical portrait described above. See Figure 1 for the real graph of f .\nThe existence of f can be proved by checking the degrees of freedom, but in fact\na formula for f can easily be found as follows. Start with an even polynomial h\nthat q\nhas critical points at 0, \u00b11 and \u00b1\u03b1, where h(0) = 0 and h(1) = \u2212h(\u03b1) (taking\n\u221a\n\u03b1 = (2 + 3) works). The function f is then given by f (z) = 1 + h(\u03b1(z\u22121))\n; note\nh(1)\nthat c1 = 1 \u2212 1/\u03b1, c2 = 1 + 1/\u03b1.\nThe critical points of g are c1 , c2 , 0, c3 and 1, where c1 < c2 < 0 < c3 < 1. Now\nwe require that g(c1 ) = c1 , g(c2 ) = g(c3 ) = 1 and g(1) = g(0) = 0. Again the\nexistence of g can be proved by counting degrees of freedom.\nNote that f is the composition of two polynomials of degree 3 and 2 respectively.\nTherefore one immediately sees that the monodromy group of f must have three\nblocks with 2 elements each. Once we determine the monodromy group of g, which\nhas no non-trivial blocks, this will be enough to prove the Theorem. However, since\nthe computations of M G(f ) and M G(g) are very similar, we will discuss them both.\nTo determine the monodromy group of f we choose a base point 1 < p < 2 and\nwe denote its (real) preimages by x1 < * * * < x6 . The critical values of f are 0, 1,\nand 2, and we define the corresponding generating loops \u03b30 , \u03b31 , and \u03b32 as follows\n(see Figure 1). The loop \u03b32 moves along the real axis from p to 2 \u2212 \u000f, for \u000f > 0 very\nsmall, then follows a full clockwise circle centered at 2 and goes back to p along\nthe real axis. When following the pre-images of this loop the points x2 and x3 first\nmove very close to c1 (thus moving upwards on the real graph of f ), then switch\nand move back to x3 and x2 , respectively. Similarly, x4 and x5 go very close to c2 ,\nthen switch and move back to respectively x5 and x4 . The preimages of \u03b32 starting\nat x1 and x6 form closed loops. Hence assigning to xi the number i, we have that\n\u03b32 induces (23)(45) \u2208 S6 .\nThe loop \u03b31 is similar: starting at p follow the real axis to 1+\u000f, then loop around\n1 and follow the real axis back to p. By checking the real graph of f one sees that\n\u03b31 induces (34). Finally, the loop \u03b30 starts at p, follows the real axis to 1+\u000f, follows\na small semi-circle centered at 1 and contained in the lower half plane, then follows\nthe real axis again until very close to 0, follows a full circle around 0 and then takes\nthe same path back to p. The graph of f shows that \u03b30 induces (12)(56).\nThus the monodromy group of f is generated by the elements (23)(45), (34),\nand (12)(56). Notice that the sets E1 = {1, 6}, E2 = {2, 5} and E3 = {3, 4} form\na partition of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 that is invariant under the action \u03b30 , \u03b31 , and \u03b32 , and\nhence for all of M G(f ). In other words E1 , E2 and E3 are M G(f )-blocks and\nM G(f ) 6= S6 .\nFor the monodromy group of g we take a base point 0 < p < 1 and we denote\nits preimages by x1 < * * * < x6 as before. The critical values of g are 0, 1 and\nc := c1 , so we define loops \u03b3c , \u03b30 and \u03b31 again following the real axis as much as\npossible as for f , and we obtain that \u03b30 induces (34)(56), \u03b31 induces (23)(45) and\n\u03b3c induces (12). Since the elements (34)(56), (23)(45) and (12) generate S6 we get\nM G(g) = S6 6= M G(f ) which completes the proof.\n\u0003\n\n\fBLOCKS OF MONODROMY GROUPS\n\n7\n\n3. Tree structure\nThe inverse images of p under f have a natural tree structure. Indeed, let\nRn = {x \u2208 C : f \u25e6n (x) = p}, and note that\nG\nRn =\nf \u22121 (x).\nx\u2208Rn\u22121\n\nThus Rn may be thought of as the top level of a tree Tn , where each vertex x is\nconnected to f (x) in the next level down, namely Rn\u22121 . Similarly, each element\nof Rn\u22121 is connected to an element of Rn\u22122 , and so on down to the level 0, which\nconsists only of p. Note that p connects to exactly d vertices, vertices in the top\nlevel connect to only one other vertex, and all vertices besides p and those not in\nthe top level connect to d + 1 other vertices. Setting R1 = {x1 , . . . , xd }, we refer\nto the d sets {f \u2212(n\u22121) (x1 )}, . . . , {f \u2212(n\u22121) (xd )} as the major branches of Rn . Note\nthat Rn is the disjoint union of the major branches. We call a branch of Rn any\nsubset of the form f \u2212m (x), where x \u2208 Rn\u2212m . We call m the height of such a branch.\nHence the major branches are simply the branches of height n \u2212 1 and we consider\nthe entire tree a branch of height n.\nBy definition, the group M Gn (f ) acts on Rn , and indeed we may think of it as\nacting on Tn since any \u03b3 \u2208 \u03c01 (C r {critical values of f \u25e6n }) may be lifted to any\nvertex of the tree. A key feature of this action is that it preserves the tree structure\nof Tn . Indeed, x, y \u2208 Tn are connected if and only if y = f (x) or x = f (y); assume\nwithout loss of generality that x = f (y). If \u03b3y is the lift of \u03b3 under f \u25e6n that starts\nat y, then f (\u03b3y ) is a (and hence the) lift of \u03b3 under f \u25e6n\u22121 starting at x. Since \u03b3(y)\nis the endpoint of \u03b3y and \u03b3(x) is the endpoint of f (\u03b3y ), we have \u03b3(x) = f (\u03b3(y)),\nimplying that \u03b3(x) and \u03b3(y) are connected. Thus the tree structure is preserved,\ngiving an injection M Gn (f ) ,\u2192 Aut(Tn ).\nThe preservation of the tree structure of Tn immediately gives that every branch\nof Rn is an M Gn (f )-block. It can also occur that an M Gn (f )-block is not a single\nbranch but a union of branches of equal height, contained in a single branch of\nheight one more. The easiest polynomial for which this can occur is f : z 7\u2192 z 4 .\nThen we have that M G(f ) is a cyclic group of order 4, so this group has two blocks\ncontaining two elements. From now on we will refer to such blocks as basic blocks:\nDefinition 3.1. Let G be a subgroup of Aut(Tn ) and let E \u2282 Rn be a G-block.\nIf E is either a single branch or is a union of equal-height branches that are all\ncontained in a single branch of height one more, then we say that E is a basic\nblock.\nSee Figure 2 for an illustration of a basic block and a non-basic block. The\nfollowing example shows that there are subgroups G < Aut(Tn ) with G-blocks that\nare not basic blocks.\nExample 3.2. Let G be the Klein 4-group acting on the complete binary tree of\nheight 2. It is generated by the elements (x00 x01 )(x10 x11 ) and (x00 x10 )(x01 x11 ).\nThen G is a subgroup of Aut(T2 ), yet {x00 , x10 } and {x01 , x11 } form an invariant\npartition. Both of these are unions of height 0 branches that are not contained in\na height 1 branch, and so are not basic.\nAs noted in Section 2, p. 4, the monodromy group of a polynomial always contains a full cycle. Hence the group in Example 3.2 cannot occur as the monodromy\n\n\f8\n\nJONES AND PETERS\n\nFigure 2. A basic block, left, consisting of branches of height 1\ncontained in a single branch of height 2. Right, a non-basic block.\ngroup of a polynomial. In the next section we see that for many polynomials f\nwe only need the existence of a full cycle to deduce strong consequences for the\npossible structures of M Gn (f )-blocks.\n4. G-blocks\nIn this section we prove results about automorphism groups of rooted trees (Theorems 4.1 and 4.3), and then derive Corollary 1.4. We also give a negative answer to\nQuestion 1.3 in Theorem 4.6. By slight abuse of notation we use the same notation\n(Tn , Rn , etc.) as the last section to refer to abstract trees.\nTheorem 4.1. Let Tn be the complete d-ary rooted tree of height n, and let Rn\ndenote the vertices of level n. Suppose that G \u2264 Aut(Tn ) contains a full dn -cycle\n\u03c3. If d is a prime power then every G-block of Rn is a basic block. If d is prime\nthen every G-block of Rn is a single branch.\nRemark 4.2. It follows that a G-block of Rn that contains points lying in distinct\nmajor branches must have at least 2dn\u22121 elements, which settles Question 1.3 for\npolynomials of prime-power degrees.\nProof. Let E be a G-block of Rn , and note that if g \u2208 G satisfies g(E) \u2229 E 6= \u2205,\nthen g(E) = E, and it follows that the orbit under g of any subset of E is contained\nin E. By choosing an ordering of the vertices at level 1 of Tn , one obtains a natural\nrepresentation of every element of Rn as a base-d string of length n. For elements\nv = v1 * * * vn and w = w1 * * * wn of Rn , define the distance between v and w to be\n(\nn\nif v1 6= w1\nD(v, w) =\nn\u2212m\nif m is such that vm+1 6= wm+1 but v1 * * * vm = w1 * * * wm\nChoose v, w \u2208 E such that D(v, w) is maximal. Then E is contained in a single\nbranch of height t := D(v, w). Let s \u2208 N be such that \u03c3 s (v) = w. Then E contains\nthe orbit of any element in V under \u03c3 s . Moreover, s is divisible by dn\u2212t (since \u03c3 s\nfixes a branch of height t) but not by dn\u2212t+1 (since \u03c3 s does not fix branches of\nheight t \u2212 1). This gives dt\u22121 \u2264 |\u03c3 s | \u2264 dt . But since d is a power of a prime it\nfollows that dt\u22121 divides the order of \u03c3 s . Thus a power of \u03c3 s is of order dt\u22121 and\ninduces a permutation of maximal order on each of the branches of height t \u2212 1.\nSince E is invariant under the action of \u03c3 it follows that E is a union of branches\nof height t \u2212 1, which completes the proof.\n\u0003\n\n\fBLOCKS OF MONODROMY GROUPS\n\n9\n\nBefore stating our next result, we recall a group G acts primitively on a set S\nwhen the only G-blocks of S consist of either one point or all of S. For instance, the\nsymmetric group on n letters acts primitively on {1, . . . , n}. Also, every doublytransitive action is primitive.\nTheorem 4.3. Let Tn be the complete d-ary rooted tree of height n, and let Rn\ndenote the vertices of height n. Let E \u2286 Rn be any set containing points in at least\ntwo major branches. Suppose that G \u2264 Aut(Tn ) contains a full dn -cycle \u03c3. Suppose\nalso that the restriction G1 of G to the height-1 vertices R1 acts primitively. Then\nthe smallest G-block containing E is all of Rn .\nProof. The idea of the proof is to use the presence of \u03c3 to show that any Gn -block\nof Rn restricts to a G1 -block of R1 , which by primitivity must be large. Again\nusing \u03c3 one shows the only lift of such a block is all of Rn .\nLet A be any G-block of Rn , and denote by A1 the restriction of A to R1 .\nLet g1 \u2208 G1 satisfy g1 (A1 ) \u2229 A1 6= \u2205, implying that for some \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 A1 we have\ng1 (\u03b1) = \u03b2. Let g \u2208 G be any lifting of g1 , and let B\u03b1 , B\u03b2 be the major branches of\nRn corresponding to \u03b1, \u03b2, whence g(B\u03b1 ) = B\u03b2 . Note also that there are elements\na \u2208 B\u03b1 , b \u2208 B\u03b2 belonging to A. Now \u03c3 d maps each major branch to itself, and\nacts on each as a dn\u22121 -cycle. Thus for some m we have \u03c3 dm g(a) = b. Since A is a\nblock, it follows that \u03c3 dm g maps A to itself. But \u03c3 dm restricts to the identity on\nR1 , meaning that \u03c3 dm g restricts to g1 . Thus g1 maps A1 to itself, proving that A1\nis a G1 -block.\nNow let E be as in the statement of the theorem, let M be the minimal G-block\nof Rn containing E, and let M1 be the restriction of M to R1 . By the previous\nparagraph, M1 is a G1 -block of R1 , and since E contains points in different major\nbranches, #M1 \u2265 2. By the primitivity of G1 , M1 = R1 . In particular, if B and\nB 0 are major branches of Rn with \u03c3(B) = B 0 then M contains some a \u2208 B and\nsome b \u2208 B 0 . Thus for some m, \u03c3 1+dm (a) = b. Hence the orbit of a under \u03c3 1+dm\nis contained in M . But since 1 + dm \u2261 1 mod d, \u03c3 1+dm acts on Rn as a dn -cycle.\nTherefore M = Rn .\n\u0003\nWe note that if G := M Gn (f ) is cyclic and f has non-prime power order, which\noccurs for instance when f is conjugate to xpq for primes p < q, then for every n \u2265 2\nthere are G-blocks that are not basic. Indeed, if \u03c3 generates G then an orbit of\nn\n\u03c3 q is a G-block consisting of pn elements. This cannot be a union of equal-height\nbranches that is contained in a branch of height one more, since each such branch\nhas a number of elements that is a power of pq. However, a polynomial for which\nthe groups G := M Gn (f ) are cyclic will have only a single critical point that is also\na fixed point. For such a map it is easy to see that the answer to Question 1.3 is\npositive, since all preimages of the point p will lie in the same Fatou component.\nTo give a negative answer we have to construct a more complicated map.\nAs noted above, polynomials conjugate to powers of x have the strong property\nof having a single critical point that is also a fixed point. As a first idea for making\nthe map somewhat more complicated, one could simply require that all critical\npoints of f also be fixed points. Such polynomials are called conservative, and they\nhave been studied in some detail [10, 8]. In particular, their conjugacy classes are\ndetermined by relatively simple combinatorial data, and there is a natural faithful\naction of Gal(Q/Q) on these conjugacy classes [8]. However, our next result shows\nthat to answer Question 1.3 in the negative, conservative polynomials will not do.\n\n\f10\n\nJONES AND PETERS\n\nIn Theorem 4.6 we give an example of a degree-6 polynomial that does provide a\nnegative answer to Question 1.3\nCorollary 4.4. Suppose that f \u2208 C[x] is conservative, and f has at least two\ncritical points. Let G = M Gn (f ) act naturally on the tree Tn of preimages of a\nsuitable point p, and let E \u2282 Rn contain points in at least two major branches of\nRn . Then the smallest G-block of Rn containing E is all of Rn .\nCorollary 4.4 is an immediate consequence of the following lemma. Recall that\na group G acts doubly transitively on a set S if for any a, b, c, d \u2208 S with a 6= c and\nb 6= d, there is g \u2208 G with g(a) = b and g(c) = d. It is straightforward to show that\na doubly-transitive action is primitive.\nLemma 4.5. Suppose that f \u2208 C[x] is conservative, and has at least two critical\npoints. Then M G(f ) acts doubly-transitively on the set R1 of preimages under f\nof a generic point.\nProof. It is enough to show that for a, b, c \u2208 R1 with a 6= b, c 6= b, there is g \u2208\nM G(f ) with g(b) = b and g(a) = c.\nBy assumption the set of critical points of f coincides with the set of critical\nvalues of f , which we write {v1 , . . . , vn }. Each vi gives an element of M G(f ) that\nacts as a single di -cycle, where di = 1 + (multiplicity of the critical value vi ). Call\nthis cycle Ci , and note that the Ci generate M G(f ). Note that\nn\nn\nX\nX\ndi = n +\nmultiplicity of vi = n + d \u2212 1.\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nConsider the graph \u0393 whose vertex set consists of R1 , and where u 6= v \u2208 R1 are\nconnected by one edge for each Ci with Ci (u) = v, and also by one edge for each\nCi with Ci (v) = u. There are no edges from any vertices to themselves. Since the\naction of M G(f ) on R1 must be transitive (e.g. since it contains a full cycle), \u0393 is\nconnected. Hence one may think of the action of M G(f ) on R1 as an interlinked\nsystem of circular conveyor belts, with the key property that each belt can be made\nto move independently of the others.\nNow obtain a new graph \u03930 by deleting one edge from each cycle, which preserves\nconnectedness.\nThe number of vertices of \u03930 is d, and the number of edges is\nPn\ni=1 (di \u2212 1), which is n + d \u2212 1 \u2212 n = d \u2212 1. Denoting by F the number of regions\nof the plane enclosed by the edges of the graph (including the region containing\ninfinity), by Euler's formula we have d \u2212 (d \u2212 1) + F = 2. Thus F = 1, whence \u03930\nis a tree. This implies that each cycle can have at most one point in common with\nany other cycle. Indeed, if Ci , Cj share two distinct points a and b, then Cir (a) = b\nand Cjs (a) = b with Cir and Cjs not the identity. This implies that in \u0393 there are\nfour distinct paths from a to b, namely those given by Cir , Ci\u2212r , Cjs , Cj\u2212s . Deleting\nany edge from Ci and any from Cj thus still leaves a cycle in \u03930 .\nNow let a, b, c \u2208 R1 be given, with a 6= b, c 6= b. In the graph \u03930 mentioned\nabove, consider a path from a to c. This path may be written as the action of\n(1)\n\ne\n\nt\u22121\nCiett Cit\u22121\n* * * Cie00\n\nwhere the action is on the left, each ej is a nonzero integer, and t \u2264 n. Choose the\npath to be non-self-intersecting, and so that t is minimized. This implies all the\ncycles in (1) are distinct, since a cycle C occurring twice violates the minimality\nof t, as all cycles between occurrences of C could be eliminated. Since any two\n\n\fBLOCKS OF MONODROMY GROUPS\n\n11\n\ncycles meet in at most one point and the path given by (1) is non-self-intersecting,\nit follows that any element of R1 may be moved by at most two of the cycles in (1).\nMoreover, these cycles must be consecutive. If b is left fixed by all the cycles in (1),\nthen we have moved a to c while fixing b and are done. If not, we let k be maximal\nso that Cik does not not fix b. Suppose that b is contained in two cycles, meaning\nit is the unique element moved by both Cik and Cik\u22121 We claim the product\n\u2212e\n\ne\n\ne\n\ne\n\nt\u22121\nk+1\nk\u22121\n* * * Cik+1\nCik\u22121k\u22121 Ciekk Cik\u22121\nCiett Cit\u22121\n* * * Cie00\n\n(2)\n\nmaps a to c and fixes b. To show (2) maps a to c, denote by a0 the image of a under\nek\u22122\nCik\u22122\n* * * Cie00 , and note it is enough to show\n\u2212e\n\ne\n\ne\n\nk\u22121\nk\u22121\nCik\u22121k\u22121 Ciekk Cik\u22121\n(a0 ) = Ciekk Cik\u22121\n(a0 )\n\ne\n\nk\u22121\nBut Ciekk Cik\u22121\n(a0 ) is a point moved by Cik , and thus cannot be moved by Cik\u22121\n0\nunless it is a , which violates the non-self-intersecting property of the path corresponding to (1). To show (2) fixes b, we need only show\n\n\u2212e\n\ne\n\nk\u22121\nCik\u22121k\u22121 Ciekk Cik\u22121\n\n(3)\n\ne\n\nk\u22121\nfixes b. To see this, note that Cik\u22121\ndoes not fix b, thus moving b away from the\nek\u22121\nunique element moved both by Cik\u22121 and Cik . Hence Ciekk fixes Cik\u22121\n(b), implying\nthat (3) fixes b.\nIn the case where b is contained in only one cycle Cik of (1) and k 6= 0, one\nverifies in a similar manner that\n\ne\n\ne\n\ne\n\nt\u22121\nk\u22121\nk\u22122\nk\n* * * Ciekk Cik\u22121\nCi\u2212e\nCiett Cit\u22121\nCik\u22122\n* * * Cie00\nk\n\nmoves a to c and fixes b. To see that b is fixed, let \u03b1 denote the unique point\ncontained in both Cik and Cik\u22121 , and note that Ciekk (\u03b1) is either c (if k = t)or\nk\nthe unique point contained in both Cik and Cik+1 . In either case, Ci\u2212e\n(b) 6= \u03b1,\nk\n\u2212ek\nimplying that Cik (b) is fixed by Cik\u22121 .

This is possible since n \u2265 2 by hypothesis. If j is such\nthat C0j (b) = \u03b1, then the element\nC0\u2212j C 0\u22121 C0e0 C 0 C0j\nmaps a to c and fixes b.\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 4.6. There exists a polynomial h of degree 6 such that R2 contains an\nM G2 (h)-block with only 4 elements, two each in two di?erent major branches of\nR2 . Moreover, h can be chosen so that it provides a negative answer to Question\n1.3.\nProof. The construction of the polynomial h is very similar to the constructions\nin the proof of Theorem 2.2. We will assume that the reader is familiar with the\npolynomial f from Theorem 2.2.\nHere the polynomial h will again have critical points at 0 < c1 < 1 < c2 < 2 and\nagain h(c1 ) = h(c2 ) = 2 and h(0) = h(2) = 0.

Real graph of h, generating loops of the corresponding\nfundamental group (all loops are counterclockwise), and computation of the action of \u03b1 on T (all connecting paths move away from\np).\n\nWe denote the generator loops encircling 0, a, 1, and 2, by \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4, respectively. The loops are again defined by paths that stay very close to the real axis\nas in the proof of Theorem 2.2 (see Figure 3). To determine the action of these\ngenerators on T , we use the method of [5, Chapter 5]. For instance, consider \u03b1.\nWe fix paths \u03c0i connecting the basepoint p to each xi , and then for each xi we\ncompute the lift `i of \u03b1 beginning at xi . Then given a vertex of T labeled with a\nword iw, \u03b1 returns the word jg(w), where xj is the endpoint of the lift of `i and\ng is the element corresponding to the loop \u03c0i `\u03c0j\u22121 . The bottom part of Figure 3\n\n\fBLOCKS OF MONODROMY GROUPS\n\n13\n\nillustrates this. We thus see that the action of \u03b1 on T is given by\n\u03b1*1\n\n=\n\n2 * id\n\n\u03b1*2\n\n=\n\n1*\u03b1\n\n\u03b1*3\n\u03b1*4\n\n=\n=\n\n3 * id\n4 * id\n\n\u03b1*5\n\n=\n\n6 * id\n\n\u03b1*6\n\n=\n\n5*\u03b4\n\nHence in wreath recursion notation, we have \u03b1 =< id, \u03b1, id, id, id, \u03b4 > (1 2)(5 6).\nIn many cases one can read the action of an element of the fundamental group\ndirectly from the real graph. For instance, to compute the action of \u03b3, note that\nfollowing preimages of \u03b3 is the same as moving the xi down along the real graph of\nh towards 1. Since none of the xi are near to each other when y = 1, the action of\n\u03b3 on the first level of T is trivial. When the y-values of these points reaches 1 + \u000f,\na counterclockwise loop is executed (in the complex plane, and so not visibly on\nthe real graph). One sees that since x2 is near a, this loop must encircle a. For the\nothers, the loops encircle no critical values, and so are homotopically trivial. Thus\n\u03b3 =< id, \u03b2, id, id, id, id > .\nSimilar computations yield\n\u03b2\n\n=\n\n< id, id, id, \u03b3, id, id > (3 4)\n\n\u03b4\n\n=\n\n< id, id, id, id, id, id > (2 3)(4 5)\n\nThe action of IM G(h) on the first two levels of T is pictured in Figure 4. Note\nthat the action of IM G(h) on the first level of the tree is the same as the action of\nthe monodromy group of f from Theorem 2.2.\nLabel a vertex on level two of T by xij , where i denotes the major branch and j\ndenotes the position within the ith major branch. Consider the partition consisting\nof\n{xij , xi(7\u2212j) , x(7\u2212i)(4\u2212j) , x(7\u2212i)(3+j) }\ni = 2, 3, j = 1, 2, 3\nas well as {x11 , x16 , x62 , x65 }, {x12 , x15 , x63 , x64 }, and {x13 , x14 , x61 , x66 }. One checks\nthat all of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4 respect this partition, and thus we have a set of G-blocks each\ncontaining four elements. Note that none of these blocks is basic.\nTo show that h provides a negative answer to question 1.3, note that a is a\nsuper-attracting periodic point so it is contained in a Fatou component V that is\na super-attracting basin. If N is chosen odd then p must be chosen in the Fatou\nset containing 1, which does not contain a critical value. One easily sees that all\npreimages h\u25e6\u2212N (p) in V lie in the same major branch which is a M GN (h)-block\nand contains 6N \u22121 elements.\nIf N = 2 and thus p \u2208 V then the preimages f \u25e6\u22122 (p) that lie in V correspond to\nthe points x32 , x42 which lie in the M G2 (h)-block E = {x32 , x35 , x42 , x45 }. So the\nsmallest M G2 (h)-block containing those two points must be contained in E (and\nis in fact equal to E). E has only 4 elements which is fewer than 61 + 1 = 7. If N\nis even but larger than 2 then again p must be chosen in V and all preimages of p\nin V are also preimages of points in E. That gives at most 4 * 6N \u22122 elements and\nthus fewer than 6N \u22121 + 1. This completes the proof.\n\u0003\n\n\f14\n\nJONES AND PETERS\n\n#\n3\n\n4\n$\n\n$\n!\n\"\n\n\"\n\n2\n\n5\n\"\n\n\"\n1\n\n6\n\n\"\n\n\"\n\nFigure 4.
