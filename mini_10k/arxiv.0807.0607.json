One aspect of it is the existence of an additional space-like\ndimension roughly corresponding to energy scale of given observables. This is plausible\nbecause the large N limit makes the theory of gauge invariant operators classical, due to large\nN factorization, while the concept of renormalization group survives in the limit. Holographic\nQCD is a theory of gauge invariant fields in 5 dimensions reconciling with these aspects.\nExperiences from the known correspondence between N = 4 SYM in 4 dimensions and\n\nType IIB string theory in AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 give us an expectation that the would-be 5-dimensional\n\nholographic dual theory of large N QCD becomes highly non-local in UV regime where the\ncorresponding large N QCD is asymptotically free, while we may expect an approximate\nlocal theory in IR region as large N QCD becomes strongly coupled. If our interest is\nonly on low-energy observables regarding strongly coupled QCD, it can be a worthwhile\napproximation to model large N QCD by a local theory in 5 dimensions, as the current\nmodels of holographic QCD do. Presumably, it is the UV asymptotic-free region where\nthese local models fail to describe large N QCD properly.\nThe existing holographic QCD models, like a top-down Sakai-Sugimoto model [1] or a\nbottom-up Hard/Soft Wall model [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], capture important aspects of low energy\nQCD such as chiral symmetry and confinement, and explain related experimental observables\nup to 20%, which one might expect from large N approximation. The previous calculations\nin the framework concern only pure QCD sector and its electromagnetic couplings (except\nRef.[7] whose method is however different from ours). As there are many important processes\nwhich involve both weak-interaction and strongly-coupled low energy QCD, it is pertinent\nto include effective weak-interactions in the framework of holographic QCD, which will allow\nus a new tool for estimating various hadronic weak processes.\nThe weak interactions are mediated by exchanges of heavy W \u00b1 or Z 0 bosons. The tree\nlevel weak interactions are thus proportional to the propagators of these bosons. In the\nlow energy limit, in which q \u226a MW \u00b1 ,Z 0 , the interactions become effective Fermi point-like\nvertices. We propose a simple prescription for introducing these effective Fermi vertices\nof weak-interaction in holographic QCD. In view of the original QCD, this corresponds to\n\n2\n\n\fperturbing the Lagrangian by the effective four-fermi operators\n\u0001 4GF \u0010 1 2\n\u00012 \u0011\n4GF\n\u2206Lweak = \u221a JW + JW \u2212 + cos2 \u03b8W (JZ 0 )2 = \u221a\n(JL ) + (JL2 )2 + JL3 \u2212 sin2 \u03b8W JQ (1)\n2\n2\nP\na\nwhere JLa = f \u03c8\u0304Lf \u03c32 \u03c8Lf and JQ are SU(2)L and electromagnetic currents respectively, and\n\n\u03b8W is the weak angle. When it is necessary, the currents in the above may include leptonic\npart as well, which should be treated as an external background.\n\nIn holographic QCD as a gauge/gravity correspondence, perturbing the QCD Lagrangian\nwould correspond to deforming boundary conditions of 5D fields near the UV boundary in a\nsuitable way. Note that there is a one-to-one map between single-trace[35] operators in QCD\nand elementary fields of holographic QCD in 5 dimensions. A 5D field \u03c6(x, r), where r is the\n5'th coordinate, behaves near the UV boundary r \u2192 \u221e as \u03c6(x, r) \u223c c1 r \u2212\u2206\u2212 + c2 r \u2212\u2206+ where\nc1 is non-normalizable and c2 is a normalizable mode. For the simplest case of perturbing\nwith a single-trace operator O,\n\u2206L =\n\nZ\n\nd4 x f (x)O(x) ,\n\n(2)\n\nit is well-known that in the holographic dual theory the boundary condition for the corresponding 5D field \u03c6O (x, r) is modified to be c1 (x) = f (x), while the normalizable mode\nencodes the expectation value of O, that is, c2 (x) = hO(x)i. However, the perturbation (1)\nthat we are interested in does not belong to this case; it consists of products of two singletrace operators J \u03bc 's. As the elementary fields in holographic 5 dimensions only map to\nsingle-trace operators, we can't simply introduce additional 5D fields for these double-trace\noperators and deform their boundary conditions as above.\nThere is an answer for this, first proposed for scalar operators [8], and generalized to\nglobal symmetry currents [9, 10]. Suppose we perturb by a general polynomial of a single\ntrace operator O,\n\u2206L =\n\nZ\n\nd4 x F (O) .\n\n(3)\n\nThe prescription is that this modifies the boundary condition for the 5D field \u03c6O to be\nc1 (x) =\n\n\u03b4F (O)\n\u03b4O\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nO\u2192c2 (x)\n\nwhere the normalization should be such that c2 is precisely equal to the expectation value,\nwhile c1 is the source for O. We will be more specific about precise normalization in our\nlater discussions of concrete examples.\n3\n\n\fAlthough the idea is general enough to be applicable to any model of holographic QCD\n(see Ref.[11] for a review), we take two prototype examples, the Sakai-Sugimoto model and\nthe Hard/Soft Wall model, to illustrate our proposal. In order to show its usefulness, we\nanalyze a few exemplar physical processes, including the charged pion decay, neutron beta\ndecay, and the leading order parity non-conserving interaction between pions and nucleons.\nWe stress that the prescription we propose should be valid to moderately higher energies\nbefore QCD asymptotic freedom sets in.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION\n\nSakai-Sugimoto model\nThe Sakai-Sugimoto model is based on a string theory set-up of probe NF D8 and D\u03048\nbranes in UV regime being joined at the IR boundary of the background of color Nc D4\nbranes, geometrically realizing spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking U(NF )L \u00d7 U(NF )R \u2192\nU(NF )I . The resulting configuration can also be viewed as NF D8 branes with two asymptotic UV regions, one for U(NF )L and the other for U(NF )R . A convenient choice of the\n5'th coordinate is Z ranging from one boundary Z = \u2212\u221e to the other Z = +\u221e, where\nthe IR regime corresponds to near Z = 0. Holographic dynamics of the chiral symmetry\nresides in the world volume U(NF ) gauge field A(x, Z) on the D8 branes, whose values near\ntwo UV boundaries Z \u2192 \u00b1\u221e couple to the global U(NF )L and U(NF )R currents of QCD\nrespectively. We will focus on the two-flavor NF = 2 case in the following, but its extension\nto NF > 2 is straightforward.\nThe part of the 5 dimensional action which is relevant for us is\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\nZ\n\u0001 1 2\n\u0001 2\n1\n2 \u22123\n4\n2\n1+Z\nSD8 = \u2212\u03ba d x dZ tr\nF\u03bc\u03bd + 1 + Z F\u03bcZ\n2\n\nwith \u03ba = \u03c04 f\u03c02 =\n\n\u03bbNc\n216\u03c0 3\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\n\u2243 7.45 \u00d7 10\u22123 to best fit the experiments for mesons, and the only\n\nscale in the model, MKK \u2243 0.95 GeV, is set to 1. Near the UV boundary Z \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, the\n\nsecond term dominates, from which the equation of motion asymptotes to \u2202Z (Z 2 \u2202Z A\u03bc ) = 0,\n\nand we have\n(1)\n\nA\u03bc (\u00b1\u221e)\n+***\nA\u03bc (Z) \u223c A\u03bc (\u00b1\u221e) \u00b1\nZ\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nnear Z \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. As usual, A\u03bc (+\u221e) \u2261 AL\u03bc couples to the U(2)L current JL\u03bc , and similarly\n\n\u03bc\n(1)\nfor A\u03bc (\u2212\u221e) \u2261 AR\n\u03bc and JR . The sub-leading coefficients A (\u00b1\u221e) are proportional to the\n\n4\n\n\fexpectation values of JL,R , and to find the precise normalization, we insert (6) in (5) and\ntake a variation with respect to sources AL,R to find the expectation values of JL,R . A quick\ncalculation gives us\n\u03bd\n2\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd hJL,R\ni = \u22122\u03baA(1)\n\u03bc (\u00b1\u221e) = \u22132\u03ba limZ\u2192\u00b1\u221e Z F\u03bcZ\n\nwhere the last expression is a gauge invariant statement.\n\n\u0001\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\nHaving identified the normalized sub-leading expansion of the holographic gauge field A,\nwe are ready to implement the effective weak interactions in the set-up. The perturbation\n(1) contains both quark and lepton currents, and the quark currents are nothing but of the\nchiral symmetry U(2)L \u00d7 U(2)R as the electro-weak interaction is a partial gauging of it.\nWe treat the lepton currents as external backgrounds in the present framework. Recalling\nU (1)\n\nthat JQ = JL3 + JR3 + 61 (JL\n\nU (1)\n\n+ JR\n\n) for quarks with U(1) charge matrix being simply 2 \u00d7 2\n\nidentity, the prescription (4) for our double-trace perturbation (1) gives us the boundary\na\n\nconditions for A = Aa \u03c32 + AU (1) 12\u00d72 near Z \u2192 \u00b1\u221e,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\n8GF\na,lepton\n2 a\na\n\u22122\u03ba Z F\u03bcZ\n+ JL\u03bc\nA\u03bc (+\u221e) = \u221a\nZ\u2192+\u221e\n2\nAa\u03bc (\u2212\u221e) = 0 , a = 1, 2 ,\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\nfrom the W \u00b1 vertices, and from the Z 0 vertex we have\n\u22121\n\u22126\n\u22126\n1\nA3\u03bc (+\u221e) =\nA3\u03bc (\u2212\u221e) =\nAU\u03bc (1) (+\u221e) =\nAU (1) (\u2212\u221e) = K\u03bc\n2\n2\n2\n1 \u2212 sin \u03b8W\nsin \u03b8W\nsin \u03b8W\nsin2 \u03b8W \u03bc\nwith\n8GF\nK\u03bc = \u221a\n2\n8GF\n+ \u221a\n2\n\n!\n\u0013\n2\nsin\n\u03b8\nW\nU (1)\n3\n\u2212\n\u22122\u03baZ 2 (1 \u2212 sin2 \u03b8W )F\u03bcZ\nF\u03bcZ\n6\nZ\u2192+\u221e\n!\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nU\n(1)\n3\n+ lepton currents\n+ F\u03bcZ\n\u22122\u03ba sin2 \u03b8W Z 2 F\u03bcZ\n6\n\u0012\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\nZ\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nNormally, we are interested in effects which are first order in GF , and for that purpose\nthe procedure of applying the above to concrete examples can be simplified in the following\nway; first solve the normalizable spectrum and wave-functions of the 4D particles of interest\nwithout GF , which has been done in the previous literature. They will contribute to the\nright-hand side of (8) and (9) and each mode then entails a non-normalizable piece of first\norder in GF , which enters the calculation of various amplitudes of hadronic weak processes.\n5\n\n,\n\n\fObserve that the non-normalizability issue of the GF -perturbed wave-functions is an order\n(GF )2 question.\nHard/Soft Wall model\nWe next implement our prescription in the Hard/Soft Wall model. The Hard/Soft Wall\nmodel is a more phenomenological attempt by taking simple AdS space-time with a hard/soft\nIR cutoff and introducing a minimal set of fields relevant for the chiral symmetry and its\nbreaking. The action takes a form\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nZ\n\u221a \u2212\u03a6\n1\n2\n4\n2\n2\nS5D = d x dz Ge tr \u2212 2 (FL,R ) + |DX| + 3|X|\n4g5\n\n,\n\n(10)\n\nwith U(2)L \u00d7 U(2)R gauge fields AL,R , a bi-fundamental scalar X, a dilaton \u03a6, and g52 =\n12\u03c0 2\nNc\n\n= 4\u03c0 2 . One virtue of the model is that a bare quark mass can be introduced via the non-\n\nnormalizable profile of X, while its normalizable mode parameterizes chiral condensate. A\npopular coordinate system often used is ds2 =\n\n1\nz2\n\n(\u2212dz 2 + dx\u03bc dx\u03bc ) where the UV boundary\n\nis z \u2192 0. As the dilaton in the Soft Wall model is \u03a6(z) = z 2 \u2192 0 near z \u2192 0, the UV\ndynamics of the Hard and Soft Wall models is identical, and so is our implementation of\nweak interactions via perturbed UV boundary conditions.\nDue to the expectation value hXi = 21 (mq z + \u03c3z 3 )12\u00d72 = v(z)12\u00d72 which breaks the axial\n\npart of the chiral symmetry A \u2261 21 (AL \u2212 AR ), there appear mixed kinetic terms between\n\nAM = (A\u03bc , Az ) and the phase part P of X = hXieiP , which is typical in a Higgs mechanism,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n2v 2\n1\n1\n\u03bc\n4\n\u03bc\n(\u2202z A\u03bc ) (\u2202 Az ) + 2 A\u03bc (\u2202 P )\nSmixing = \u22122 d xdz tr\n,\n(11)\nz\ng52\nz\nwhere the indices are contracted with flat metric \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd = diag(+1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121). This brings\na slight complication into the analysis of UV behavior of our 5D gauge fields, but not in\nan essential way as we will see shortly. Note that the isospin part of the chiral symmetry\nV = 21 (AL + AR ) remains intact, and the asymptotic UV expansion from equation of motion\n\nis easily found to be\nV\u03bc \u2192 V\u03bc (0) + V\u03bc(1) z 2 + * * *\n\n,\n\n(12)\n\nand the usual interpretation of source and expectation value goes as before.\nTo study the (A\u03bc , Az , P ) system clearly, it is convenient to work in a 5D analog of R\u03be gauge by adding the following gauge fixing term in the bulk [12, 13],\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u00152\n\u0012 \u0013\nZ\n2v 2\n1\n1\nAz\n1\n4\n\u03bc\n\u2212 2P\nd xdz tr \u2202\u03bc A \u2212 2\u03be\nz\u2202z\nSg.f. = \u2212\n2\u03be\nz\ng52\nz\nz\n6\n\n,\n\n(13)\n\n\fwhich removes the mixing terms between A\u03bc and (Az , P ), up to an important left-over\nboundary term,\nSbdry\n\n2\n= 2\ng5\n\nZ\n\n4\n\nd x tr\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nA\u03bc \u2202 \u03bc Az\nz\n\nz\u21920\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\nThis boundary term will be important later in discussing coupling of external sources to\nthe pions. The above gauge is especially useful in identifying physical degrees of freedom\nin a transparent way. Upon 4D reduction via KK mode expansion, one combination of Az\nand P gives longitudinal components of massive vector mesons from A\u03bc , while the other\ncontains the pions and the excited scalar mesons. To separate longitudinal components of\nvector mesons from the pions, we further take a unitary gauge \u03be \u2192 \u221e, upon which (Az , P )\nincludes only physical pions and its excitations, and allows us to replace P with Az via\n\u0012 \u0013\n2v 2\nAz\n1\n=\nP .\n(15)\nz\u2202\nz\ng52\nz\nz2\nThe resulting equation of motion for Az can be solved for the pions and excited scalar\nmesons, with the UV boundary condition Az \u223c O(z) for normalizability [13].\nThe action for A\u03bc in our gauge then becomes simply\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1\n1\n4v 2 (z)\n1\n4\n2\n2\n\u03bc\nSA = d xdz tr \u2212 2 (F\u03bc\u03bd ) + 2 (\u2202z A\u03bc ) +\nA\u03bc A + Sbdry\nz\n2g5\ng5\nz2\n\n,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere indices are contracted with the flat metric ds2 = \u2212dz 2 + dx2 , and its equation of\nmotion along z is\n\u2202z\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n1\n1\n4g 2v 2 (z)\n\u2202z A\u03bc \u2212 \u2202\u03bd F\u03bd\u03bc \u2212 5 3 A\u03bc = 0 ,\nz\nz\nz\n\n(17)\n\nwhose solution has a UV asymptotic\n(1) 2\nA\u03bc \u223c c1 zK1 (g5 mq z) + c2 zI1 (g5 mq z) \u223c A(0)\n\u03bc + A\u03bc z +\n\n\u0001 2\n1\n(0)\n\u2202\u03bd F\u03bd\u03bc\n+ g52 m2q A(0)\nz log z + * * *\n\u03bc\n2\n\nwhich is essentially same to the case without a Higgs breaking. We observe that the UV\nbehavior is not much affected by the symmetry breaking through hXi =\n6 0, and we can apply\n(0)\n\n(1)\n\nthe usual dictionary of source and expectation value to A\u03bc and A\u03bc respectively. It is also\npossible to prove this assertion more rigorously by the standard procedure of holographic\nrenormalization [14]. Observe that the previously identified boundary term (14) in our\nunitary gauge also contributes to the expectation value as it becomes\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\nZ\n1 \u03bc\n2\n4\n(0)\n\u2202 Az\n,\nSbdry = 2 d x tr A\u03bc\ng5\nz\nz\u21920\n7\n\n(18)\n\n\fand there is a similar term for V = 12 (AL + AR ) too.\nAs we find that the usual gauge/gravity dictionary holds for the U(2)L \u00d7 U(2)R bulk\ngauge fields, it is straightforward to implement our proposal for effective weak interactions.\n(1)\n\nThe precise relation between AL,R and hJL,R i from the above discussion is\n\u03bd\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd hJL,R\ni=\u2212\n\n1 1\n2 (1)L,R\nA\n+ 2 \u2202\u03bc AL,R\nz\n2 \u03bc\ng5\ng5 z\n\nz\u21920\n\n=\n\n1 1 L,R\nF\ng52 z \u03bcz\n\nz\u21920\n\n,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere the second contribution from (18) makes the final result gauge invariant, which is\nimportant to include the cases with the pions coming from Az \u223c O(z). Using this, the\nFermi-interaction via W \u00b1 exchange corresponds to the boundary condition\n\u0013\n\u0012\n8GF 1 1 La\na,leptons\na\nAL\u03bc (0) = \u221a\n, a = 1, 2 ,\n+ JL\u03bc\nF\u03bcz\nz\u21920\n2 g52 z\nAaR\u03bc (0) = 0 ,\n\n(20)\n\nand similarly for the Z 0 exchange as in (9).\nThe boundary conditions (8), (9) and (20) are our main points in the paper. To find\neffects which are lowest order in GF , we first solve normalizable modes dynamics without\nGF , and via (20) non-normalizable perturbations of linear order in GF are induced. We\npoint out that to leading order in GF , our prescription is equivalent to large N factorizing\nour effective JJ weak vertices and then calculating chiral form factors of hadrons.\n\nEXEMPLAR CALCULATIONS\n\n(1) Charged pion weak decay \u03c0 + \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bd\u03bc\nFor an illustrative purpose of showing how the prescription works, we compute via our\nmethod a few simple hadronic weak processes which involve only W \u00b1 exchange, while the\nanalysis of neutral current phenomena and fitting the weak angle \u03b8W are left to the future.\nOne of the cleanest observables from charged current exchange is the decay of charged\npions; more than 99% of \u03c0 + decay to \u03bc+ \u03bd\u03bc via W + -exchange, while the electron channel\nm2e\nm2\u03bc\nJL+, lepton\n\n\u03c0 + \u2192 e+ \u03bde is helicity suppressed by\nto the external leptonic current\n\n\u223c 10\u22125 . Computing the relevant pion coupling\n= (J 1 \u2212 iJ 2 )lepton =  \u0304lL \u03b3 \u03bc \u03bdL is in fact easy as\nL\n\nL\n\nthe lepton current simply acts as a source for the corresponding quark current through (8)\na\n\nin the Sakai-Sugimoto model, or (20) for the Hard/Soft Wall model. Expanding Aa \u03c32 =\n\n8\n\n\f\u221a1 (A+ \u03c3 \u2212\n2\n\n+ A\u2212 \u03c3 + ) for bulk fields [36], this is equivalent to having an external source\nA+ (+\u221e) = (4GF ) JL+, lepton = (4GF )  \u0304lL \u03b3 \u03bc \u03bdL\n \u0304 \u03bc\nA+\nL (0) = (4GF ) lL \u03b3 \u03bdL\n\n(Sakai \u2212 Sugimoto)\n\n(21)\n\n(Hard/Soft Wall) .\n\n(22)\n\nWe consider the case of Sakai-Sugimoto model first. To identify how pions interact with\nthe above external source for chiral currents, working in the R\u03be -gauge with unitary limit\n\u03be \u2192 \u221e again seems most convenient. By the similar procedure to reach (16) in the Hard/Soft\nWall models, the final action in our unitary gauge becomes\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\nZ\n1\n2 \u2212 13 2\n4\n2\n2\nS = \u2212\u03ba d x dZ tr (1 + Z ) F\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 (1 + Z )(\u2202Z A\u03bc )\n2\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n+\u221e\n2\n4\n\u03bc\n,\n+ d x tr (\u2202\u03bc \u03c0) \u2212 f\u03c0 tr (\u2202 \u03c0)A\u03bc\n\n(23)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere we used AZ =\n\n1\n\u221a1\n\u03c0\u03ba 1+Z 2\n\n\u03c0(x) in our unitary gauge with \u03ba = \u03c04 f\u03c02 . Note that the last\n\nterm comes from the remaining boundary term after adding the gauge fixing term as in\n(14). Mode expansion of A\u03bc contains (pseudo) vector mesons as normalizable modes plus\nexternal sources for the chiral currents as non-normalizable modes. These non-normalizable\nmodes then couple to the pions only through the last boundary term that we are looking\nfor. The result in fact agrees with the old current algebra expression. Expanding \u03c0 =\n\u221a1 (\u03c0 + \u03c3 \u2212 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c3 + ) and plugging in A(+\u221e) = \u221a1 A+ (+\u221e)\u03c3 \u2212 = 4G\n\u221a F ( \u0304\nlL \u03b3 \u03bc \u03bdL )\u03c3 \u2212 , we get the\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\ncoupling\nL\u03c0 \u0304l\u03bd = \u22122GF f\u03c0 (\u2202\u03bc \u03c0 \u2212 )( \u0304lL \u03b3 \u03bc \u03bdL ) .\n\n(24)\n\nWe expect the same result from the Hard/Soft Wall model as well. Since in our gauge the\npions reside in Az = \u03c0(x)f (z) with a normalized profile f (z) \u223c z, the previously identified\nboundary term (14) in the unitary gauge gives us the same type of coupling between \u03c0(x)\n1\n \u0304 \u03bc\nand A+\nL (0) = (4GF ) lL \u03b3 \u03bdL . To realize this, note that A = 2 (AL \u2212 AR ), thus the boundary\nterm (14) reproduces\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0010\n1\ntr (\u2202\u03bc \u03c0)(A\u03bcL \u2212 A\u03bcR )\nf (z)\ng52 z\nz\u21920\n\nz\u21920\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\u2261 \u2212f\u03c0 tr (\u2202\u03bc \u03c0)(A\u03bcL \u2212 A\u03bcR )\n\nz\u21920\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n(25)\n\nso that we have a near z \u2192 0 expansion of the pion profile Az = \u03c0(x)f (z),\nf (z) = \u2212(g52 f\u03c0 )z + * * *\n9\n\n,\n\n(26)\n\n\fwhich will be useful for later calculations involving the pions. Recall that the coupling\nstrength of the pions to external current sources, as appears in Eq. (24) is one of the definitions of f\u03c0 . Using standard kinematics [30], one uses the experimental decay rate to find\nf\u03c0 \u2248 92 MeV. Thus, in weak-interacting holographic QCD we successfully predict not only\nthe operator structure but also the value of the decay constant.\n(2) Neutron beta decay\nWe next analyze a more complicated weak-process involving nucleons; neutron beta decay\nto proton and the first generation of leptons, n \u2192 p+ e\u2212 \u03bd \u0304e , with \u223c 100% branching ratio.\nAs we treat the lepton current JL\u2212, lepton = \u03bd \u0304L \u03b3 \u03bc eL as external, the analysis is similar to the\nprevious example, that is, the lepton current will play a role of external source for the chiral\nsymmetry current\nA\u2212 (+\u221e) = (4GF ) \u03bd \u0304L \u03b3 \u03bc eL\n\u03bc\nA\u2212\nL (0) = (4GF ) \u03bd \u0304L \u03b3 eL\n\n(Sakai \u2212 Sugimoto)\n\n(27)\n\n(Hard/Soft Wall) ,\n\n(28)\n\nand we need how the nucleons couple to the above external source of chiral currents. As a\nmodel calculation, we proceed by adopting the recent effective field approach to holographic\nbaryons in Ref.[15, 16] for the Sakai-Sugimoto model, and in Ref.[12] for the Hard Wall\nmodel. See also Refs.[17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23] for other approaches to holographic baryons.\nOne difference from the previous example of the pions is that the resulting coupling would\nbe momentum-dependent on general grounds. In other words, the result should be phrased\nas a form factor [24, 25, 26, 27]. The resulting form factor in general can be rewritten as a\nsum over infinite number of intermediate excitations, similar in spirit to vector dominance\n[26]. The case of pions in the previous example is special in this respect as they couple to\nthe bulk gauge fields only at the boundary through Sbdry [37]. As the neutron beta decay is\na 3-body decay, the relevant momentum transfer is the invariant mass square q 2 of the e\u2212 \u03bd \u0304e\npair, which ranges m2e < q 2 < (mn \u2212 mp )2 . In practice however the relevant q 2 in our case\nis too small compared to the QCD scale to make any notable difference from simply using\nq 2 = 0 in numerical computations.\nWe work in the Sakai-Sugimoto model first. In our previous unitary gauge, we solve the\nequation of motion for A\u03bc of a specific 4-momentum q \u03bc with our prescribed boundary condition A\u03bc (+\u221e) =\n\n8G\n\u221aF\n2\n\nlepton\nJL\u03bc\nand A\u03bc (\u2212\u221e) = 0. Writing A\u03bc (x, Z) = A\u03bc (Z)e\u2212iq*x , the equation\n\nfor A\u03bc (Z) in fact splits into two parts, one for transverse and the other for longitudinal\n10\n\n\fpolarization, and the final form of the solution is\n\u0014\n\u0015\nq\u03bc q\u03bd\nq\u03bc\nT\nA\u03bc = A (q, Z) \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2 A\u03bd (+\u221e) + 2 (q * A(+\u221e))\u03c8+ (Z) ,\nq\nq\n\n(29)\n\nwith AT (q, Z) satisfying\n\u0001\n1\nq 2 (1 + Z 2 )\u2212 3 AT + \u2202Z (1 + Z 2 )\u2202Z AT = 0 ,\n\nwith the boundary condition AT (q, +\u221e) = 1, AT (q, \u2212\u221e) = 0, and \u03c8+ (Z) =\n2\n\u03c0\n\n(30)\n1\n(1\n2\n\n+\n\ntan\u22121 (Z)). By computing how holographic baryons couple to the above q 2 -dependent\n\nbulk gauge field, we read off nucleon interaction with an external source A\u03bc (+\u221e), which in\nour case is an external lepton current.\nThis is not the whole story however. There is an additional important contribution\ncoming from tree-level pion-exchange. This is because pions couple to external currents by\nthe last term in (23), and from the interaction of holographic baryons to AZ in the bulk,\nwe can also obtain an axial coupling of pions to the nucleons, and hence follows a coupling\nbetween external sources and the nucleons via tree-level pion-exchange.\nFor a practical computation in the following, we should be specific about a model of\nholographic baryons, for which we choose the model in Ref.[15] as an example. The effective\naction of a spin- 21 , SU(2) doublet holographic baryon B, as the lowest spin state of collective\nquantization of 5D instanton-baryon on the NF = 2 D8 branes, is most easily written in\nRZ\ndZ \u2032\nthe conformal coordinate system (x\u03bc , w) with w = 0\n2 , under which the 5D baryon\n\u20322\n(1+Z ) 3\n\naction doesn't involve spin connections,\nZ\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n4\nSbaryon = d x dw iB\u0304\u03b3 M (\u2202M \u2212 iAM )B \u2212 mB (w)B\u0304B + (0.90)i B\u0304\u03b3 M N FM N B + * * * ,(31)\n\nwhere the position dependent mass term mB (w) can be obtained from the energy of\n\nthe S 4 -wrapped D4 brane at the position w, whose explicit form is not essential in our\npresentation, and the last term is determined to reproduce the long-range tail of the\ninstanton-baryon solution [38]. We then perform usual KK reduction to 4D by expanding B(x, w) = fL (w)NL (x) + fR (w)NR (x), where (NL , NR ) \u2261 N(x) is the 4D baryon mode\nwe identify as the nucleons, and the profile functions fL,R (w) satisfy a suitable eigen-value\nequation with the eigenvalue mN being the mass of the nucleons. We have an important\nparity property fR (\u2212w) = fL (w). Once we find fL,R , we can insert our previous A\u03bc from\n(29) and AZ into the action (31) to find how external sources and the pions couple to the\nnucleons.\n11\n\n\fAfter a straightforward calculation, the result is summarized by [15, 29]\nLN \u2212external = N\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc V\u03bc N + N\u0304 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 5 A\u03bc N + N\u0304 \u03b3 \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd N\n\n,\n\n(32)\n\nwith\nZ\nZ\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n2\n2\nV\u03bc =\ndw |fL | + |fR | A\u03bc (w) + (0.90) dw |fL |2 \u2212 |fR |2 \u2202w A\u03bc (w) ,\n2\nZ\nZ\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n2\n2\nA\u03bc =\ndw |fL | \u2212 |fR | A\u03bc (w) + (0.90) dw |fL |2 + |fR |2 \u2202w A\u03bc (w) ,\n2\nZ\nF\u03bc\u03bd = (0.54)i dw fL fR F\u03bc\u03bd (w) ,\n(33)\nfor the nucleon couplings to external sources encoded in (29), and\nLN \u2212\u03c0 = \u2212\n\ngA\nN\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 5 (\u2202\u03bc \u03c0)N\nf\u03c0\n\n,\n\n(34)\n\nwith\ngA = 2\n\nZ\n\n2\n\ndw |fL | \u03c80 (w) + 4 * (0.90)\n\nZ\n\ndw |fL |\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nd\u03c80\ndw\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(35)\n\nfor the pion-nucleon axial coupling.

Note that the Sakai-Sugimoto model does\nnot have a bare quark mass by construction and the pions are massless [39]. In any realistic\napplication of the above result, we therefore should replace the q 2 -pole in the above with\nm2\u03c0 . This unsatisfactory feature will be absent in the Hard Wall model however, as we can\nintroduce a bare quark mass in the set-up.\nWe next turn to the analysis in the Hard Wall model. As the procedure is identical to the\nprevious one in the Sakai-Sugimoto model, we will be brief in explaining the intermediate\nsteps while showing the results. For our purpose we will work in the holographic baryon\nmodel of Ref.[12] for the Hard Wall model as it is most suitable to see how holographic\nbaryons couple to external chiral currents. The holographic baryon action for the Hard Wall\nmodel reads as\nZ\nZ\np \u0002\n\u0003\n4\nSN =\nd x dz G5 iN\u03041 \u0393M DM N1 + iN\u03042 \u0393M DM N2 \u2212 m5 N\u03041 N1 + m5 N\u03042 N2\nZ\nZ\np \u0002\n\u0003\n4\n+\nd x dz G5 \u2212g N\u03041 XN2 \u2212 g N\u03042 X \u2020 N1\nZ\nZ\np \u0002\n\u0003\nL\nMN R\n4\nN\n\u2212\nN\u0304\n\u0393\nF\nN\n)\n,\n+\nd x dz G5 (iD)(N\u03041 \u0393M N FM\n1\n2\n2\nN\nMN\n\n(41)\n\nwhere N1 (N2 ) is a doublet under SU(2)L (SU(2)R ). The 5D Dirac mass m5 is related\nto the scaling dimension \u2206 of the QCD 3-quark nucleon operator by m5 = (\u2206 \u2212 2), and\n\nfor simplicity we take \u2206 = 29 . The second line gives us the observed nucleon mass mN =\n0.94 GeV when the chiral symmetry is broken hXi 6= 0. For the popular values zm =\n(330 MeV)\u22121 , \u03c3 = (311 MeV)3 and mq = 2.34 MeV, this determines the coupling g to be\n\ng = 9.18. We leave the coefficient D as a free parameter. For these parameters, we have\nf\u03c0 = 0.084 GeV and the pion-nucleon axial coupling is numerically gA = (0.33 + 1.02D)\nwhere D is in units of (GeV)\u22121 .\nAs the tree-level pion-exchange contribution is given by (38) except the q 2 -pole replaced\nby m2\u03c0 , it is an order O(q 2 ) effect which is negligible. By essentially same procedures as\nin the Sakai-Sugimoto case, our final effective interaction for the neutron beta decay in the\nHard Wall model is found to be\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n4GF 1\n5\n\u03bd\n(n\u0304\u03b3\u03bc p) + (0.33 + 1.02D) (n\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03b3 p) \u2212 (0.48D) q (n\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd p) (\u03bd \u0304L \u03b3 \u03bc eL ).(42)\nLn\u0304pe\u2212 \u03bd\u0304e = \u221a\n2\n2\n2\n13\n\n\fThe neutron beta decay rate depends linearly on the axial form factor at zero energy, i.e.\ngA . In fact, gA is calibrated using this process. Since the Sagai-Sugimoto model overpredicts\ngA by about 2%, it would also underpredict the neutron half-life by the same ratio.\nIn order to estimate the prediction of the Hard/Soft Wall model, we need to fix D. In\nprinciple, this could be done by using the physical value of either the axial form factor or\nthe weak magnetism form factor. In the Sagai-Sugimoto model, these two form factors are\nsuccessfully predicted as can be seen in Eq. (40). In the case of Hard Wall model, we find\na tension between the two, that is if we choose to fit D \u2243 0.94 by gAexp = 1.27, then the\nmagnetic form factor is too small by 50%. There is however a chance for improving the\nbottom-up Hard Wall model, for which we hope to come back in the future [33].\n(3) Parity non-conserving (PNC) pion-nucleon coupling\nOur final example is something whose theoretical estimate has been difficult to obtain\nwith other conventional tools. It is also a first non-trivial example which does not involve\nexternal leptons, so that the full aspect of our proposal should be used for its calculation.\nWe are interested in the parity-violating couplings of mesons, especially the pions, to the\nnucleons induced by weak-interactions. For an illustrative purpose, we focus here only on\nthe charged pion-nucleon coupling from a W \u00b1 -exchange, and a more complete study of the\nproblem will be presented elsewhere [33].\nAs before, the procedure of applying (8) and (20) to first order in GF starts by first solving,\nwithout GF , the relevant normalizable modes for the particles involved in the process one\nis trying to study. Some of these normalizable modes, such as mesons, come from the bulk\ngauge fields of chiral symmetry, and the right-hand side of (8) or (20) is non-vanishing for\nthem in general. These modes are then accompanied by the induced boundary values in\nthe left-hand side of (8) or (20), which would act just like external sources for the chiral\ncurrents. From studying how external sources couple to the other particles of interest, we\ncan obtain the GF -induced interactions between the original modes and the other particles.\nIt is the pion in our case which carries an induced external source by (8) or (20), and\nhow this external source would couple to the nucleons is described in the previous sections.\nIn the Sakai-Sugimoto model, the pions are sitting in AZ as before and from (8), this entails\na source\n8GF\nA\u03bc (+\u221e) = \u2212 \u221a\n2\n\nr\n\n4\u03ba\n8GF\n(\u2202\u03bc \u03c0) = \u2212 \u221a f\u03c0 (\u2202\u03bc \u03c0)\n\u03c0\n2\n14\n\n.\n\n(43)\n\n\fWe have the same result in the Hard/Soft Wall model. Once we find the induced source, we\ncan come straight to our previous results of nucleon couplings to external sources; (32) and\n(33) for the Sakai-Sugimoto model and similar expressions for the Hard Wall model. As we\nmay need a general momentum transfer q \u03bc between the nucleons and the pions, we should\nsolve the necessary AT (q 2 ) profile function numerically for a given q 2 . For the q 2 \u2192 0 limit\nhowever, we have a simplification as before to get\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0001\n\u0001\nq\u03bc q\u03bd\nweak\n\u03bc\n+\n\u03bc 5\n\u03bd +\nLN \u2212\u03c0 = \u22122GF f\u03c0 (p\u0304\u03b3 n) \u2202\u03bc \u03c0 + gA \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2 (p\u0304\u03b3 \u03b3 n) \u2202 \u03c0\n+ h.c. , (44)\nq\nfor the Sakai-Sugimoto model, and similarly for the Hard Wall model except the pionexchange term. Note that F\u03bc\u03bd = 0 in our case as the source is purely longitudinal. Only\nthe first piece in the above corresponds to the parity non-conserving (PNC) coupling, while\nthe second term is a small correction to the usual gA . The first term is identical to the\ncontribution of pion exchange to the PNC coupling, as achieved by current algebra and\nchiral perturbation theory [34]. Although the above pion-nucleon coupling in q 2 \u2192 0 limit\n\nis largely dictated by chiral algebra alone, its non-trivial q 2 -dependence when we consider\n\nfinite q 2 is beyond the ability of the chiral algebra. Our framework can give predictions for\nthat. Our method can also provide predictions for the coupling of other excited mesons such\nas \u03c1, \u03c9, etc, whose details will be reported soon elsewhere [33].\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have outlined a proposal for including effective weak interactions in the framework\nof holographic QCD. By construction, this prescription should be applicable up to energies\nof a few GeV. In order to demonstrate the implementation of the prescription, we chose two\nspecific models, the Sagai-Sugimoto and Hard/Soft Wall models. The use of our method\nin three low- energy processes, namely charged pion decay, neutron beta decay, and PNC\nnuclear-meson couplings, showed the usefulness and strength of our prescription.\nContrary to other theoretical tools to calculate such reactions, e.g. chiral perturbation\ntheory, the current approach not only recovers the operator structure of previous methods,\nbut also gives a quantitative estimate, up to about 10-20%, of the coupling constants. In\naddition, our weak-interacting holographic QCD can be extended to energies higher than\nthe QCD scale, which is not assessable in other methods.\n15\n\n\fOf course, there are many things to be done to improve the model. We hope that our\nfirst step will stimulate further study and possible refinement of our present proposal.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Institute for Nuclear Theory (INT) at the University of Washington for the\nprogram \"From Strings to Things: String Theory Methods in QCD and Hadron Physics\",\nwhere this work was initiated, and H.U.Y. thanks the organizers for hospitality.
