One of the most crucial materials for spintronics is half-metal,\nwhere the electrons at the Fermi level are fully spin polarized. This property allows the spin\nto be effectively injected and detected. Half-metallicity is theoretically predicted in (half)Heusler compounds3 , diluted magnetic semiconductor4 , oxides and double perovskites4,5 .\nIn order to have this particular property, materials are required to have proper magnetic\nexchange splitting of the electronic state with different spins to push the Fermi level into\nthe gap of one spin channel. The gap may be developed because of crystal field or fully\noccupation of certain atomic orbitals. So most known half metals are either oxides, sulfides\nor Heusler alloys. Magnetism is commonly found in materials with localized d or f electrons.\nThe p-orbitals are generally believed to be delocalized and magnetism is usually not expected. However, recently magnetism is predicted in compounds where p-orbitals are found\nto host it6 . The main argument for this p-orbital magnetism is the localization of p-orbitals\ndue to the large interatomic distance. The p-orbital magnetism was intensively investigated in the compounds of (I,II)A-(IV,V,VI)A. Half-metallic ferromagnetism is predicted\nin compounds of CaC, SrC and BaC with zinc-blende structure9 , as well as with rocksalt\nstructures8 . The investigation is also extended to rocksalt and zinc-blende LiS, NaS, KS,10\nand NaN, KN,11 , alkaline earth selenides12 as well as mononitrides13 , pnictides14 . In this\nwork, electronic structures of alkaline earth carbides (MIIA C) are calculated. Compounds\nwith rocksalt structures are investigated as it was shown that this is more stable than those\nwith zincblende structure8 at T = 0. The feature of the electronic structure was mapped\nto p-orbitals where condition to have half metallicity was discussed based on the rigid band\nmodel. The calculations were then extended to alkali metal carbides (MIA C) where ferromagnetic semiconductor was found in three of these compounds. We also proposed that\ncarbides with mixing of IA and IIA group elements might also be fully spin polarized.\n2\n\n\fII.\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL METHOD\n\nThe calculations were performed with the full-potential local-orbital code15 in the version\nFPLO9.00-33 with the default basis settings. All calculations were done within the scalar\nrelativistic approximation. The GGA exchange-correlation functional was chosen to be\nPBE16 The number of k-points in the the Brillouin zone was set to 32 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 32 in order\nto get ensure the convergency of the calculated parameters. The number of k-points is\nsometimes crucial to the energy and magnetic states17 in these compounds. Convergency of\nthe total energy was set to be better than 10\u22128 Hartree together with that of the density\nbetter than 10\u22126 in the internal unit of the codes. FCC unit cell (space group Fm3m) was\nused to represent the rocksalt structure with Wyckoff positions assigned to metal (M) and\nC as M(0,0,0) and C(0.5,0.5,0.5), respectively.\n\nIII.\n\nELECTRON ORBITAL POPULATION\n\nAs shown by the previous works SrC and BaC show half metallic character in the equilibrium ferromagnetic state8 . The compounds crystalized into the rock-salt structure where\nthe alkaline earth and C atoms form simple cubic lattice, alternately positive and negative.\nThe lattice constants at equilibrium of the selected MIA C and MIIA C compounds are listed\nin Table I. The lattice constants are roughly proportional to the summation of the ionic\nradii of the cations and covalent radius of C as shown in Fig.1. This means that the atoms\nin the compounds can be treated as impenetrable charged spheres. The lattice constant\nLiC falls off the trend was because of the nonmagnetic nature which favors smaller volume.\nHowever, the half of the lattice constant are larger than the summation which means the\nmetal elements are not totally ionic.\nThe valance electrons are provided by the 2p orbitals of C and the outmost s electrons\nfrom the metals. Projection of the total valence electrons onto each atomic orbitals was\nshown in Table II. The electron population analyse is demonstrating. As the compounds\nfrom the same group are similar in electron population, we took BaC and KC as an example\nfor clarity.\nFrom Table II, we see that in BaC the total 6 valence electrons of Ba 6s2 and C 2s2 2p2 are\nredistributed where 0.86 electron per atom is transferred from Ba to C because of electroneg3\n\n\fativity and intermixing of the wave functions of the d-orbitals and carbon p-orbitals.. Two\n6s electrons of Ba are partially excited into the 6p and 5d orbitals. Only a small fraction\n(12%) is left. This situation is similar in KC. There are totally 0.69 electron transferred from\nK to C. At the same time one 4s electron is partially excited into the 4p and 3d orbitals.\nOnly 9% of the s-electrons remains. The 2s electrons of carbon did not participate bonding,\nwhich was contributed by the 2p-electrons.\n\nIV.\n\nDOS OF THE COMPOUNDS\n\nIn order to keep clarity, we begin with the total DOS and its atomic projection in the\nnonmagnetic state of BaC as shown in Fig. 2. There is a gap of 0.7 eV below and above\ncontributed mainly from C and Ba states respectively. The Fermi level is at the shoulder\nof the high peak (van Hove singularity) in DOS which is 0.1 eV above the Fermi level. The\nDOS at the Fermi level is as high as 5.4 1/eV per formula unit. This high DOS can lead to\nmagnetic instability according to the Stoner's criterion as will be discussed later on. Eighty\npercent of the total DOS at the Fermi level was contributed by the C atom. The band\nwidth is quite narrow, which is only about 2.5 eV. This is much narrower than the usual\nbandwidth of the p-electron, e.g., about 12 eV in diamond. It is due to the much larger\natomic separation of C which is 4.26 \u00c5 in BaC while in diamond it is only 1.55 \u00c5. It can be\nimaged that when the ferromagnetism sets in, the magnetic exchange splitting pushes the\nFermi level in the up spin channel upwards and that of the down spin channel downwards.\nBecause of the bandgap, the Fermi level can be set just inside the gap by suitable exchange\nsplitting. Thus the half metallicity is produced as shown in Fig. 3(c). The exchange splitting\nof the up and down spins, estimated from the difference of the maximum and minimum of\nthe spin up and spin down channels, is about 1.35 eV. The other three compounds show\nsimilar electronic structure as shown in Fig. 3. The main difference is the shrink of the\nbandwidth when going down the row of the Periodic Table. It is because of the increase\nof the cation radii and naturally the increase of the lattice constant as shown in Fig. 1.\nThe exchange splitting is hardly changed as indicating in the figure. The increase of the\nbandwidths destroys the half metallicity, and even makes spin polarization unstable as in\nBeC, where the bandwidth is as large as 9.6 eV (not shown in the figure).\n4\n\n\fV.\n\nTHE BAND STRUCTURE AND THE MODEL DOS\n\nIn order to understand the electronic structure more clearly, the so-called fat bands\ntogether with the normal bands are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the states around\nthe Fermi level are mostly from C 2p orbitals. The van Hove singularity in the DOS in Fig.\n2 about 0.1 eV above the Fermi level is from the non-dispersing bands along K \u2212 W \u2212 U\ndirections in the reciprocal space. There are some contributions to the states around the\nFermi level from the t2g states of Ba 5d because of unavoidable interactions between Ba and\nC. The states above the gap are mainly from 5d states of Ba. At the \u0393 point, the eg and\nt2g states are separated by 1.5 eV. The bonding states at X from t2g set an upper energy of\nthe gap. The nonmagnetic compound is an indirect bandgap semiconductor.\nFrom the analyse above, we can schematically draw the DOS of the compounds as shown\nin Fig. 5. In the nonmagnetic state the 2p states locate around the Fermi level. The d\nstates from the metal are split into eg and t2g bands. They are separated from the 2p states\nby an energy gap. The DOS of spin down and spin up are equally occupied as in Fig. 5(a).\nAccording to this model, six electrons can be hold in 2p orbitals at most. The magnetic\nmoment M (in \u03bcB ) and the total number of the valence electrons Nval are related by\nM = 3 \u2212 (Nval \u2212 3) = 6 \u2212 Nval .\n\n(1)\n\nThe total valence electrons include the outmost s-electrons in the metals and two 2p-electrons\nin C. The 2s electrons of C do not participate bonding because of its localization in these\ncompounds. In this rigid band model, the exchange splitting (Eex ), the spin flip bandgap\nEgsf which is defined by the difference of the lowest unoccupied down spin level and the\nhighest occupied up spin level and the bandwidth (Eb ) of the p-orbitals are related by\nEex = Egsf + Eb .\n\n(2)\n\nAccording to this model, there are two possibilities to obtain half metallicity: the spin up\nchannel is fully occupied and the spin down channel is partially occupied as in Fig. 5(b) or\nthe spin up channel is occupied and the spin down channel is empty as in Fig. 5(c). There is\na special case where the spin up channel is full and the spin down is empty, so that magnetic\nsemiconductor with different gaps can be obtained as shown in Fig. 5(d). The DOS model\nshown in (b) is the case of SrC, BaC, RaC as shown in Fig. 3. In the cases of (c) and (d),\n5\n\n\fthere should be less electrons in the system. Thus if we substitute IIA elements with IA\nones, we can have situation (d) because 3 electrons in the valence state can fully occupy the\nspin up channel. We can arrive (c) by partial substitution of IIA by IA elements.\n\nVI.\n\nDOS OF THE MIA C COMPOUNDS\n\nMotivated by the model DOS analysis above, we performed calculation to MIA C. The\nDOS of MC compounds where M = Na, K and Rb are shown in Fig. 6. LiC is nonmagnetic and the DOS is omitted here. From the figure, we see that KC, RbC and CsC are\nsemiconductors with fully spin polarized 2p states, and the spin flipping gap are 0.5 and\n0.8 eV, respectively. NaC is on the verge of being fully spin polarized. It is due to the\nlarge bandwidth compensating the enhancement of the exchange splitting. The spreading\nof the p-orbitals is largely depended on the atomic distances, scaling with d\u22122 according to\nHarrison18 where d is the atomic distance. In this case the exchange splitting is not large\nenough to push the down spin states to higher energy and transfer the down spin electrons\nto the up spin channel to make it fully occupied. In NaC, metallic state is induced because\nthe large spreading of the p-state which is more than 3.5 eV due to the small lattice constant\nof 5.52 \u00c5 compared with the other magnetic compounds in this row. C's in LiC are much\ntoo close so that the DOS at the Fermi level is only about 1.16 eV\u22121 which is far too low to\nintrigue magnetic instability as will be discussed below.\n\nVII.\n\nSTONER CRITERION ON P-ORBITAL MAGNETISM\n\nThe magnetism in the compounds originates from the relatively contracted wave functions\nof the p-orbitals and its unsaturation as discussed by Volnianska6,7 . The relative large atomic\nradii of the cations reduce the hopping of the p-electrons of the carbon. The bandwidth\nread from the DOS is 3.0 eV which is at the same scale and even smaller than that of 3d\nelements. This is an indication of the localization of the orbitals. This narrow spread of\nthe p-state results in the high DOS at the Fermi level, which induces magnetic instability\naccording to the Stoner criterion. In the simplified version of this theory the Stoner criterion\nfor spin polarization is IN0 > 1 where I is the exchange integral (Stoner parameter) and N0\n6\n\n\fis the DOS at the Fermi level at the ground state. The exchange integral determined from\n\u03c7=\n\nN0\n1 \u2212 IN0\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the susceptibility is calculated by\n1\n\u2202 2 E(m)\n=\n.\n\u03c7\n\u2202m2\n\n(4)\n\nThe E(m) curves in Equ. (4) are calculated by the fixed spin moment method. The DOS\nat the Fermi level (N0 ) and the exchange integrals (I) estimated from Equ. (3) and their\nproducts (IN0 ) of the compounds are listed in Table I. As shown in the Table, the products\n(IN0 ) are larger than 1, as it should be, in the compounds with magnetic ground state. In\nthese two groups of compounds the exchange integral are essentially not changed. However,\nthe exchange splitting in IA group is larger than that in IIA, which is the consequence of\nlarger magnetic moment, because the exchange splitting is proportional to Im2 . Larger\nexchange constants can generally lead to higher Curie temperature according to the mean\nfield consideration, which is favorable in applications.\n\nVIII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn summary we have used full potential density functional codes to study the electronic\nstructure of alkali and alkaline earth carbides with the rocksalt structure. It was found that\nSrC, BaC, RaC were halfmetals, while KC, RbC and CsC were semiconductors. It was also\npossible to have half-metallic electronic structure by doping alkali compounds with alkaline\nearth or vice versa according to our analysis. The spin polarization was mainly within the\nlocalized p-orbitals in C due to the large lattice constant determined by the large radii of the\ncations. The origin of the magnetism could be understood from the Stoner's itinerant theory\nwhere the exchange integrals of the compounds were calculated. The electronic structure\ncould be explained by a rigid band model. These compounds are similar to these with\nthe zincblende structure9 : The carbon atoms form fcc sublattice with the lattice constants\nonly about 10% smaller than those of the zincblende structure at equilibrium. The density\nof states of both show two humps mainly from the p-states due to the ligand field. The\nmain features determined by the carbon atoms gives an opportunity to tune the magnetic\nexchange splitting by applying pressure where spin gapless semiconductor may be realized,\n7\n\n\fwhich may have superior electronic properties. Although these compounds are predicted\nto show attractive properties for spintronics, they are hypothetical at present. It may be a\nchallenge to synthesize the compound, but it is highly recommended.\n\nIX.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nThis work was financially supported by International Science & Technology Cooperation\nProgram of China(2012DFA510430) and Excellence of Central Universities.\n\n\u2217\n\nxwzhang@uestc.edu.cn\n\n1\n\nS.
