In electromagnetic theory for\nexample the interaction between charged particles is described by the Maxwell field equations. Since they are linear, interactions add. However, more often than not, the\nfield equations are nonlinear as for example in the case of\nGeneral Relativity: even though the energy-momentum\ntensor couples linearly to the curvature, the latter depends in a nonlinear way on the spacetime metric and\nits derivatives [1, 2, 3]. The source of the nonlinearity\nlies in the geometric nature of the problem. Not only do\ninteractions fail to add up, even the humble two particle\nproblem poses challenges.\n\"Effective\" interactions between macroscopic degrees\nof freedom arise in statistical physics when a partial\ntrace is performed in the partition function over unobserved microscopic degrees of freedom [4, 5]. The Boltzmann factor invariably renders these interactions nonlinear. This time, the source of the nonlinearity is the\nentropy hidden in the degrees of freedom that have been\ntraced out. For example, the effective interaction between charged colloids in salty water is described (at a\nmean-field level) by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation [6].\nIn this paper we will discuss a classical example which\nbelongs to the class of effective interactions, while owing its nonlinearity to its geometric origin: the interaction between particles mediated by the deformation\nof a surface to which they are bound. This problem includes the capillary interactions between particles\nbound to liquid-fluid interfaces [7, 8, 9], or the membrane mediated interactions between colloids or proteins\nadhering to or embedded in lipid bilayer membranes\n\n[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. To approach the problem\nwe require two pieces of information. First, how does the\nenergy of the surface depend on its shape, or in other\nwords, what is the \"surface Hamiltonian\"? Second, how\ndoes a bound particle locally deform the surface? With\nthis information, we may (in principle) deduce the equilibrium shape minimizing the energy of the surface for\nany given placement of the bound particles. Knowing\nthe shape, the energy can be determined by integration,\nand the forces it implies follow by differentiating with\nrespect to appropriate placement variables. In general,\nhowever, the ground state of the surface is a solution of a\nnonlinear field equation (\"the shape equation\"), thereby\nthwarting progress by this route at a very early stage.\nSometimes the linearization of a nonlinear theory is\nadequate. Just as one recovers Newtonian gravitation\nas the weak-field limit of General Relativity [1, 2, 3], or\nDebye-H\u00fcckel theory as the weak-field limit of PoissonBoltzmann theory [6], a linear theory for surface mediated interactions is useful for certain simple geometries,\nnotably weakly perturbed flat surfaces. At this level,\nthe approach to interactions based on energy becomes\ntractable. Yet, linearization is also often inadequate. The\nfull theory may display qualitatively new effects which\nare absent in the linearized theory: strong gravitational\nfields give us black holes [1, 2, 3]; the bare charge of\na highly charged colloid gets strongly renormalized by\ncounterion condensation [17].\nThere is, however, an alternative approach to interactions which was outlined in [18]. By relating the interaction between particles to the equilibrium geometry of\nthe surface, a host of exact nonlinear results is provided.\nThe link is formed by the surface stress tensor, and it can\nbe established without solving the shape equation. Once\nwe know the Hamiltonian, we can express the stress at\n\n\f2\nany point in terms of the local geometry \u2013 covariantly\nand without any approximation. We will briefly revisit\nthe essentials of this construction in Sec. II. Knowing\nthe stresses, the force on a particle is then determined\nby a line integral of the stress tensor along any surface\ncontour enclosing the particle, as we will show in Sec. IV.\nSuch results might, at first sight, appear somewhat formal: without the equilibrium surface shape, they cannot\nbe translated into hard numbers. However, the close link\nbetween the force and the geometry, combined with a\nvery general knowledge one has about the surface shape\n(e. g., its symmetry) will turn out to provide valuable\nqualitative insight into the nature of the interaction (e. g.,\nits sign). Even on a completely practical level, this approach scores points against the traditional approach involving energy, providing a significantly more efficient\nway to extract forces from the surface shape determined\nnumerically (in whatever way).\nWe will illustrate this approach with a selection of examples involving different symmetries and surface Hamiltonians. In Sec. III we demonstrate how its scope extends\nin a very natural way to include internal degrees of freedom on the membrane \u2013 in particular: a vector order\nparameter which has for instance been used to describe\nlipid tilt [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. To make contact with\nthe energy based approach in the literature, and also in\norder to link the formalism to a more familiar setting,\nwe specialize in Sec. V to a Monge parametrization and\nits linearization. This will permit us in Sec. VI to derive force-distance curves for interactions mediated by\nsurface tension, membrane curvature, and lipid tilt. Various well-known linear results [7, 8, 11] then follow very\nnaturally using the stress tensor approach.\n\nII.\n\nENERGY FROM GEOMETRY\n\nIn this paper we want to study the physics of interfaces, which are characterized by a reparametrization invariant surface Hamiltonian. The appropriate language\nfor this is differential geometry, and in this section we\nwill outline how physical questions can be formulated\nvery efficiently in this language. We first summarize the\nnecessary mathematical basics and introduce our notation (the reader will find more background material in\nRefs. [25]). We then define the class of Hamiltonians we\nwill be considering. The corresponding Euler-Lagrange\nequations for the interface degrees of freedom will be cast\nas a conservation law. The most direct way to do this is\nto implement all geometrical constraints using Lagrange\nmulipliers; not only does this approach provide a quick\nderivation of the shape equation, it also provides a transparent physical identification of the surface stresses.\n\nA.\n\nDifferential Geometry and Notation\n\nWe consider a two-dimensional surface \u03a3 embedded in\nthree-dimensional Euclidean space R3 , which is described\nlocally by its position X(\u03be 1 , \u03be 2 ) \u2208 R3 , where the \u03be a are\na suitable set of local coordinates on the surface. The\nembedding functions X induce two geometrical tensors\nwhich completely describe the surface: the metric gab\nand the extrinsic curvature Kab , defined by\ngab = ea * eb\nand\nKab = ea * \u2202b n ,\n\n(1a)\n(1b)\n\nwhere a, b \u2208 {1, 2}. The local coordinate frame formed\nby the tangent vectors e1 and e2 extended by the normal\nvector n forms a local basis of R3 :\nea = \u2202X/\u2202\u03be a = \u2202a X ,\nea * n = 0 ,\nn2 = 1 .\n\n(2a)\n(2b)\n(2c)\n\nNote that unlike n, the ea are generally not normalized.\nIn the following, \u2207a denotes the metric-compatible covariant derivative [26] and \u2206 = \u2207a \u2207a the corresponding Laplacian. Surface indices are raised with the inverse metric g ab . The trace of the extrinsic curvature,\nK = g ab Kab , is twice the mean curvature. Using the\nabove sign conventions, a sphere of radius a with outward pointing unit normal has a positive K = 2/a.\nThe intrinsic and extrinsic geometries are related by\nthe Gauss-Codazzi-Mainardi equations\n\u2207a Kbc \u2212 \u2207b Kac = 0 ,\nKac Kbd \u2212 Kad Kbc = Rabcd ,\n\n(3a)\n(3b)\n\nwhere Rabcd is the Riemann tensor constructed with the\nmetric; its contraction over the first and third index is\nthe Ricci tensor, Rbd = g ac Rabcd , whose further contraction gives the Ricci scalar curvature, R = g bd Rbd .\nFrom Eqn. (3b) we see that the latter satisfies R =\nK 2 \u2212 K ab Kab . In particular in two dimensions we have\nthat R = 2 KG , where KG = det(Kab ) is the Gaussian\ncurvature (Gauss' Theorema Egregium [25]).\nB.\n\nSurface energy and its variation\n\nWe consider surfaces such as lipid membranes and soap\nfilms, characterized by the property that the associated\nenergy is completely determined by the surface geometry\nand described by a Hamiltonian which is an integral of a\nlocal Hamiltonian density H over the surface:\nZ\ndA H(gab , Kab , \u2207a Kbc , . . .) .\n(4)\nH[X] =\n\u03a3\n\n\u221a\nThe infinitesimal area element is dA = g d2 \u03be, where\ng = det(gab ) is the determinant of the metric. The density H depends only on scalars constructed from local\n\n\f3\nsurface tensors: the metric, the extrinsic curvature, and\nits covariant derivatives. In order to find the equilibrium\n(i. e., energy minimizing) shape, one is interested in how\nH responds to a deformation of the surface described by\na change in the embedding functions, X \u2192 X + \u03b4X.\nThe straightforward (but tedious) way to do this is to\ntrack the course of the deformation on X through gab ,\n\u221a\ng, Kab , and any appearing covariant derivatives using\nthe structural relationships (1) and (2).\nAlternatively, one can treat gab , Kab , ea and n\nas independent variables, enforcing the structural relations (1) and (2) using Lagrange multiplier functions [27]. One thus introduces the new functional\nHc [gab , Kab , . . . , X, ea , n, \u03bbab , \u039bab , f a , \u03bba\u22a5 , \u03bbn ] given by\nHc = H[gab , Kab , . . .]\nZ\n(1a)\n+\ndA \u03bbab (gab \u2212 ea * eb )\nZ\n(1b)\n+\ndA \u039bab (Kab \u2212 ea * \u2202b n)\nZ\n(2a)\n+\ndA f a * (ea \u2212 \u2202a X)\nZ\n(2b)\n+\ndA \u03bba\u22a5 (ea * n)\nZ\n(2c)\n+\ndA \u03bbn (n2 \u2212 1) .\n\n(5)\n\nThe original Hamiltonian H is now treated as a function of the independent variables gab , Kab and its covariant derivatives; \u03bbab , \u039bab , f a , \u03bba\u22a5 and \u03bbn are Lagrange\nmultipliers fixing the constraints (1) and (2). The introduction of auxiliary variables greatly simplifies the variational problem, because now we do not have to track\nexplicitly how the deformation \u03b4X propagates through\nto gab and Kab . As we will see in the following, this approach also provides a very simple and direct derivation\nof the shape equation in which the multiplier f a , which\npins the tangent vectors to the surface, is identified as\nthe surface stress tensor.\nNote that additional physical constraints can be enforced by introducing further Lagrange multipliers (such\nas a pressure P in the case that a fixed volume is enclosed\nby the surface).\n\nEuler-Lagrange equations for X, ea , n, gab and Kab :\n\u2207a f a\nfa\n0\n\u03bbab\n\n\u039bab = \u2212Hab .\n\nEuler-Lagrange equations and the existence of a\nconserved current\n\nThe Hamiltonian (4) is invariant under translations.\nAs explained in detail in Ref. [28], Noether's theorem\nthen guarantees the existence of an associated conserved\ncurrent, which we will identify as the surface stress tensor\nin Sec. II D. In order to see this, let us first work out the\n\n(6a)\n(6b)\n, (6c)\n(6d)\n(6e)\n\nNote that the Weingarten equations \u2202a n = Kab eb have\nbeen used in Eqn. (6b); the Gauss equations \u2207a eb =\n\u2212Kab n have been used in Eqn. (6c). We have also defined\n\u03b4H\nand\n\u03b4Kab\n\u221a\n2 \u03b4( gH)\n= \u2212\u221a\n.\ng \u03b4gab\n\nHab =\n\n(7a)\n\nT ab\n\n(7b)\n\nThe manifestly symmetric tensor T ab is the intrinsic\nstress tensor associated with the metric gab . If H does\nnot depend on derivatives of Kab , functional derivatives\nin the definition of Hab and T ab reduce to ordinary ones.\nEquation (6a) reveals the existence of a conservation\nlaw for the current f a . Using the other equations (6c),\n(6d) and (6e), it is straightforward to eliminate the Lagrange multipliers on the right hand side of Eqn. (6b)\nto obtain an explicit expression for f a in terms of the\noriginal geometrical variables. From Eqn. (6c) we find\n\u03bba\u22a5 = \u2212\u2207b \u039bab because ea and n are linearly independent; the Eqns. (6d) and (6e) determine \u03bbab and \u039bab .\nThus Eqn. (6b) can be recast as\nf a = (T ab \u2212 Hac Kcb )eb \u2212 (\u2207b Hab )n .\n\n(8)\n\nOnce the Hamiltonian density has been specified,\nEqn. (8) determines the conserved current f a completely\nin terms of the geometry. Several representative examples are treated in the Appendix.\nFinally, as pointed out in Refs. [27, 28], the normal projection of \u2207a f a is the Euler-Lagrange derivative E(H) of\nthe original Hamiltonian H which vanishes for an equilibrium shape [29]. Using the Gauss equations once more,\nwe obtain the remarkably succinct result\nn * \u2207a f a = E(H) = \u2212Kab T ab + (Kac Kbc \u2212 \u2207a \u2207b )Hab .\n(9)\nD.\n\nC.\n\n= 0,\n= (\u039bac Kcb + 2\u03bbab )eb \u2212 \u03bba\u22a5 n ,\n= (\u2207b \u039bab + \u03bba\u22a5 )ea + (2\u03bbn \u2212 \u039bab Kab )n\n= 12 T ab ,\n\nIdentification of the stress tensor\n\nWe will now show that f a can be identified with the\nsurface stress tensor. The variation of the Hamiltonian has a bulk part proportional to the Euler-Lagrange\nderivative (6) as well as boundary terms: under a change\nin the embedding functions X \u2192 X + \u03b4X one gets\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b4Hc = dA \u2207a f a * \u03b4X \u2212 \u2207a (f a * \u03b4X) .\n(10)\n\n\fSfrag replacements\n\n4\n\n\u2202\u03a30\n\n\u2202\u03a32\n\u03a31\n\nUsing the equations of Gauss and Weingarten [32], the\nrelation \u2207a f a = En can then be cast in the form\n\n\u03a32 l\u03a3\n\n\u2202\u03a31\n\nl\u03a3\n\n\u03a3\n\nl\u03a3\n\n\u03a30\n\n\u2207a f a = Kab f ab + E ,\n\u2207a f ab = \u2212Kab f a .\n\nl\n\u2202\u03a3out\n\nFIG. 1: Surface \u03a3 with 3 disjoint boundary components \u2202\u03a3i\nand an outer limiting boundary \u2202\u03a3out .\n\nAdditional boundary contributions stem from the variations with respect to n, gab and Kab , since these terms\ndo or may contain further derivatives which then need\nto be removed by partial integration. However, the one\nappearing in Eqn. (10) is the only one that is relevant\nfor identifying the stress tensor: As we will see below,\nfor this we are exclusively interested in translations, for\nwhich n, gab and Kab remain unchanged.\nConsider, in particular, a surface region \u03a3 in equilibrium (see Fig. 1): its boundary \u2202\u03a3 consists of n disjoint\nclosed components \u2202\u03a3i and an outer limiting boundary\n\u2202\u03a3out . Each of the \u2202\u03a3i is also the closed boundary of a\nsurface patch \u03a3i . Under a constant translation \u03b4X = a\nof \u2202\u03a3i the only non-zero term is\n\u03b4Hc = \u2212a *\n\nI\n\n\u2202\u03a3i\n\n(i)\n\nds la\u03a3 f a = \u2212a * F ext .\n\n(11)\n\nStokes' theorem has been used to convert the surface integral into a line integral. The vector l\u03a3 = la\u03a3 ea is the\noutward pointing unit normal to the boundary on the surface \u03a3; by construction it is tangential to \u03a3. The variable\ns measures the arc-length along \u2202\u03a3i . The boundary inte(i)\ngral is thus identified as the external force F ext acting on\n\u2202\u03a3i : dotted into any infinitesimal translation, it yields\n(minus) the corresponding change in energy [30].\nThe external force F ext on the surface patch \u03a30 is sim(0)\nply given by \u2212F ext due to Newton's third law\nF ext =\n\nI\n\nds la f a =\n\nZ\n\n\u03a30\n\n\u2202\u03a30\n\ndA \u2207a f a ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere l = \u2212l\u03a3 and Stokes' theorem was used again.\nRecall now that in classical elasticity theory [31] the\ndivergence of the stress tensor at any point in a strained\nmaterial equals the external force density. Or equivalently, the stress tensor contracted with the normal vector of a local fictitious area element yields the force per\nunit area transmitted through this area element. Comparing this with Eqn. (12) we see that f a is indeed the\nsurface analog of the stress tensor: la f a is the force per\nunit length acting on the boundary curve due to the action of surface stresses.\nIt proves instructive to look at the tangential and normal projection of the stress tensor by defining\na\n\nab\n\na\n\nf = f eb + f n .\n\n(13)\n\n(14a)\n(14b)\n\nTangential stress acts as a source of normal stress \u2013\nand vice versa. Both conditions hold irrespective of\nwhether the Euler-Lagrange derivative E actually vanishes. In fact, Eqn. (14a) shows that the shape equation\nE = 0 is equivalent to \u2207a f a = Kab f ab , while Eqn. (14b)\nmerely provides consistency conditions on the stress components. For instance, the Helfrich Hamiltonian H \u221d K 2\nyields f a \u221d \u2207a K, while f ab is a quadratic in the extrinsic curvature tensor (see Eqn. (A4)). Hence, Eqn. (14a)\nimmediately reproduces the characteristic form of the\nEuler-Lagrange derivative: \u2206K plus a cubic in the extrinsic curvature.\nIII.\n\nINTERNAL DEGREES OF FREEDOM\n\nSo far we have restricted the discussion to Hamiltonians which are exclusively constructed from the geometry\nof the underlying surface. However, the surface itself may\npossess internal degrees of freedom which can couple to\neach other and, more interestingly, also to the geometry. The simplest example would be a scalar field \u03c6 on\nthe membrane, which could describe a local variation in\nsurface tension or lipid composition, and it is readily incorporated into the present formalism [33].\nHere we will look a little more closely at the case of\nan additional tangential surface vector field ma . Such a\nfield has been introduced to describe the tilt degrees of\nfreedom of the molecules within a lipid bilayer, to accommodate the fact that the average orientation of the\nlipids themselves need not coincide with the local bilayer\nnormal (see for instance Refs. [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]).\nMany additional terms for the energy emerge in the presence of a new field ma (for a systematic classification see\nRef. [21]). However our aim here is not to treat the most\ngeneral case. Instead, we will focus on a simple representative example to illustrate how easily the present\nformalism generalizes to treat such situations.\nLet us define the properly symmetrized covariant tiltstrain tensors M ab and F ab according to\n\u0001\n1 a b\n\u2207 m + \u2207b ma ,\n2\n=\n\u2207a mb \u2212 \u2207b ma .\n\nM ab =\n\n(15a)\n\nab\n\n(15b)\n\nF\n\nIn the spirit of a harmonic theory we construct a Hamiltonian density Hm from the following quadratic invariants:\nHm =\n\n1\n1\n\u03bbM 2 + \u03bcMab M ab + \u03bdFab F ab + V (m2 ) , (16)\n2\n4\n\nwhere M = gab M ab = \u2207a ma is the tilt divergence. The\nfirst two terms coincide with the lowest order intrinsic\n\n\f5\nterms identified by Nelson and Powers [21], provided we\nrestrict to unit vectors ma [34]. These terms are multiplied by new elastic constants \u03bb and \u03bc, playing the analogous role to Lam\u00e9-coefficients [35]. If m2 6= 1 a third term\n(also absent in usual elasticity theory [31]) occurs, the\nquadratic scalar constructed from the antisymmetrized\ntilt gradient; its structure is completely analogous to the\nLagrangian in electromagnetism [36]. Finally, if the magnitude of ma is not fixed, we may also add a potential V\ndepending on the square m2 = ma ma of the vector field\nma . Without loss of generality we assume that V (0) = 0,\nbecause any nonvanishing constant is more appropriately\nabsorbed into the surface tension \u03c3. If V (x) is minimal\nfor x = 0, then ma \u2261 0 will minimize the energy, but\ndepending on physical conditions V may favor nonzero\nvalues of |ma |. This is why below the main phase transition temperature of lipid bilayers the lipids can acquire\na spontaneous tilt.\nThis particular choice for Hm is purely intrinsic.\nHence, Eqn. (8) shows that the corresponding material stress f am is also purely intrinsic, therefore tanab\nab\ngential, and given by f am = Tm\neb , where Tm\n=\n\u221a \u22121 \u221a\n\u22122 g \u03b4( gHm )/\u03b4gab is the metric material stress.\nPerforming the functional variation (see Appendix) we\nfind\nab\nTm\n=\n\n\u00012 i\n\u0001\n1h\n\u03bb M 2 + 2mc \u2207c M + \u03bd \u03b5cd \u2207c md g ab\n2 h\n\n+ \u03bc \u2212 McdM cd g ab + 2M M ab + 2mc \u2207c M ab\ni\n\u2212 (\u2207c ma )(\u2207c mb ) + (\u2207a mc )(\u2207b mc )\n\u2212 V (m2 )g ab \u2212 2V \u2032 (m2 )ma mb ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03b5ab = n * (ea \u00d7 eb ) is the antisymmetric epsilontensor [37]. Notice that the metric stress tensor is\nquadratic in the tilt-strain, not linear. Unlike the stress\ntensor in elasticity theory, this tensor is not obtained as\nthe derivative of the energy with respect to the strain\nbut rather with respect to the metric, which leaves it\nquadratic in the strain. The formal analogy alluded to\nearlier is therefore not complete.\nab\nAdding the material stress Tm\nto the tangential geometric stress f ab , we find with the help of Eqns. (14) the\nequilibrium conditions\nab\n0 = \u2212Kab Tm\n+E ,\n= 0.\n\nab\n\u2207a Tm\n\n(18a)\n(18b)\n\nThe first of these equations shows how the material degrees of freedom \"add\" to the geometric Euler-Lagrange\nderivative E of the geometric Hamiltonian H; this is the\nmodified shape equation. The second equation \u2013 which\nbefore provided consistency conditions on the geometrical stresses \u2013 tells us that the material stress tensor\nis conserved. The equilibrium of the material degrees\nof freedom involves the vanishing of the Euler-Lagrange\n\nderivative with respect to the field ma , which is given by\nEm a =\n\n\u03b4Hm\n= \u2212\u03bb\u2207a \u2207b mb \u2212 (\u03bc + \u03bd)\u2207b \u2207a mb\n\u03b4ma\n\u2212 (\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd)\u2206ma + 2V \u2032 (m2 )ma . (19)\n\nIn general, the equilibrium condition Em a \u2261 0 implies\nEqn. (18b). For a single vector field ma the converse also\nholds so that Eqn. (18b) may be used in place of the\nequilibrium condition [38].\nIn equilibrium, we have not only Em a \u2261 0, we also\nhave \u2207a Em a = 0. Using the commutation relations for\ncovariant derivatives [39], it is then easy to see that the\ntilt also satisfies the following equation on the surface:\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(\u03bb + 2\u03bc)\u2206M + \u03bc\u2207a (Rma ) \u2212 2 2V \u2032\u2032 m2 + V \u2032 M = 0 .\n(20)\nNotice that \u03bd has dropped out of this equation, which\nfollows from the fact that F ab is invariant under U (1)\ngauge transformations [40]. For small values of tilt, we\ncan expand the potential as\nV (m2 ) =\n\n1 2 1\ntm + um4 + * * *\n2\n4\n\n(21)\n\nIn the untilted phase we can terminate this expression\nafter the first term (since then t > 0). If we now restrict\nto a flat membrane (and thus R \u2261 0) Eqn. (20) simplifies\nto a Helmholtz equation for the tilt divergence:\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(\u03bb + 2\u03bc)\u2206 \u2212 t M = 0 ,\n(22)\n\nshowing that (in lowest order) any nonzero M is (essentially) exponentially damped with a decay length of\nr\n\u03bb + 2\u03bc\nlm =\n.\n(23)\nt\nIf t < 0 gets us into the tilted phase, the expansion (21)\nhas to be taken one order higher, leaving instead a nonlinear Ginzburg-Landau equation to be solved.\nWe finally remark that even though the system of\nEuler-Lagrange equations (18) is quite formidable, it still\nenjoys one nice nontrivial property: The material equation (18b) is purely intrinsic. This is the case because\nthe material stress is tangential, which itself derives from\nthe fact that the material Hamiltonian is intrinsic. If we\nwere to add a coupling between tilt and extrinsic curvature, such as the chiral term \u03b5ac Kbc ma mb , this decoupling\nwould no longer hold.\n\nIV.\n\nFORCES BETWEEN PARTICLES\n\nParticles bound to an interface can exert indirect forces\nonto each other. Since these are mediated by the interface, they must be encoded in its geometry. We have seen\nthat the \"coding\" is done by the surface stress tensor f a .\nThe problem is to decode this content.\n\n\f6\nIn this section we will solve this problem. The strong\nlink between stress and geometry can be easily turned\ninto exact expressions for mediated interactions. The\nmethod by which we obtain these results for various different Hamiltonians as well as the final formulas are one\nof the major results of this paper.\nA.\n\nThe stress tensor and external forces\n\nConsider a single simply-connected patch \u03a30 . The external force acting on it is given by Eqn. (12). If there\nare no external [41] forces acting on \u03a30 , the integrals\nappearing in Eqn. (12) will vanish; but even when F ext\ndoes not vanish, the stress tensor remains divergence free\n(Eqn. (6a)) on any part of the surface not externally\nacted upon. As a result, the contour integral appearing in Eqn. (12) will be independent of the particular\nclosed curve so long as it continues to enclose the source\nof stress and does not encroach on any other sources.\nObserve now that in general a multi-particle configuration can be stationary only if external forces constrain\nthe particle positions. These are the forces providing the\nsource of stress in Eqn. (12). The force F we are ultimately interested in is the force on a particle mediated by\nthe interface counteracting this external force; we therefore evidently have F = \u2212F ext .\nB.\n\nfor the surface stress tensor associated with this Hamiltonian. To facilitate the calculation of the force it is convenient to introduce an orthonormal basis of tangent vectors {t, l} adapted to the contour \u2202\u03a30 : t = ta ea points\nalong the integration contour and, as introduced previously, l = la ea points normally outward. The elements of\nthe extrinsic curvature tensor with respect to this basis\nare given by\n\nForce between particles on a fluid membrane\n\nLet us now focus on a symmetric fluid membrane, described by the surface Hamiltonian\nH=\n\n1\n\u03ba K2 + \u03c3 ,\n2\n\n(24)\n\nwhich, up to irrelevant boundary terms, is equivalent to\nthe Hamiltonians introduced by Canham [42] and Helfrich [43]. Here, \u03ba is the bending rigidity and \u03c3 is the\nlateral tension imposed on the boundary. For typical\nphospholipid membranes \u03ba is of the order of a few tens\nof kB T , where kB T is the thermal energy. Values for \u03c3\nare found to be in a broad range between 0 up to about\n10 mN/m [44]. The Hamiltonian (24) covers interesting\nspecial cases in various limits: soap films on setting \u03ba = 0\nand tensionless membranes on setting \u03c3 = 0. Note that\nthe two elastic constants provide a characteristic length\nr\n\u03ba\nl :=\n,\n(25)\n\u03c3\nseparating short length scales over which bending energy\ndominates from the large ones over which tension does.\nWe now need to determine the force (12) on a particle for the Hamiltonian described by Eqn. (24). Using\nEqns. (A3) and (A4) from the Appendix, we obtain\ni\nh\n\u0001\n1\nf a = \u03ba K ab \u2212 Kg ab K \u2212 \u03c3g ab eb \u2212 \u03ba(\u2207a K) n (26)\n2\n\nK\u22a5 = la lb Kab ,\nKk = ta tb Kab ,\n\n(27a)\n(27b)\n\nK\u22a5k = la tb Kab .\n\n(27c)\n\nWe obtain for the integrand appearing in the line integral\nin Eqn.

(30)\nNote that the integrand has been decomposed with respect to a (right-handed) orthonormal basis adapted to\nthe contour, {l, t, n}.\nC.\n\nTwo-particle configurations\n\nWe are interested in applying the general considerations of Sec. IV A to surface mediated interactions between colloidal particles. In particular, we will consider a\nsymmetrical configuration consisting of two identical particles bound to an asymptotically flat surface, as sketched\nschematically in Fig. 2.\nWe label by {x, y, z} the Cartesian basis vectors of\nthree-dimensional Euclidian space R3 . Remote from the\nparticles, the surface is parallel to the (x, y) plane.\nLet us agree that the constraining force fixes only the\nseparation between the particles; their height, as well as\ntheir orientation with respect to the (x, y) plane are free\nto adjust and thus to equilibrate. This is also true of the\ncontact line between surface and colloid when it is not\npinned. Indeed, Kim et al. [15] carefully argue that vertical forces and horizontal torques typically exceed horizontal forces and vertical torques by a significant amount.\n\n\f7\n2\n\n3\n\nz\n1\n\nl\n\ny\n\nt\n\n4\n\nx\n\nFIG. 2: Two identical particles bound to an interface. As described in the text, the contour of integration can be deformed\nin order to take advantage of available symmetries.\nn\n\n\u03c6\n\nFIG. 3: Cross-section of a symmetric (solid line) and an antisymmetric (dotted line) two-particle geometry.\n\nSince the former can thus be assumed to very quickly\nequilibrate, they generally do not contribute to the membrane mediated interaction.\nThere are two distinct manifestations of two-particle\nsymmetry in this situation: either a mirror symmetry in\nthe (y, z) plane (the symmetric case) or a twofold symmetry axis, coinciding with the y axis (the antisymmetric\ncase). The former is relevant if the two particles adhere\nto the same side of the surface, the latter applies if they\nadhere on opposite sides (see Fig. 3). In these two geometries the line joining corresponding points on the two\nparticles lies along the x-direction.\nIt is now possible to deform the contour of the line\nintegral (12) to our advantage: as indicated in Fig. 2, the\ncontour describing the force on the left hand particle may\nalways be pulled open so that the surface is flat on three\nof its four branches (2, 3 and 4). The contributions from\nbranch 2 will cancel that from 4; the only mathematically\ninvolved term stems from branch 1. The force on the\nparticle is then given by\n\u0014Z\nZ \u0015\nds la f a .\n(31)\nF =\u2212\n+\n1\n\n3\n\nLet us now apply this general approach to a surface\nwhose energetics can be described by the Hamiltonian\ndensity (24).\nD.\n\nThe force between particles with symmetry\n1.\n\nFluid membranes\n\nBoth mirror and two-fold axial symmetry of branch 1\nimply that in Eqn. (30) the tangential term proportional\n\nto t vanishes. In the first case this follows from the fact\nthat branch 1 becomes a line of curvature; hence, the\ncurvature tensor is diagonal in (l, t)-coordinates and thus\nK\u22a5k vanishes. In the second case two-fold axial symmetry forces both Kk as well as K\u22a5 to be zero, since branch\n1 becomes a straight line and the profile is antisymmetric. In consequence, K = K\u22a5 + Kk = 0. We thereby\nobtain the first important simplification of the force from\nEqn. (30) on that branch:\n\u001b\n\u001ah\nZ\ni\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n2\n\u03ba K\u22a5\n\u2212 Kk2 \u2212 \u03c3 l \u2212 \u03ba \u2207\u22a5 K n .\nF 1 = \u2212 ds\n2\n1\n(32)\nWe now examine separately the two symmetric geometries (see discussion in Sec. IV C).\na. Symmetric case. Tangent and normal vector on\nbranch 1 lie in the (y, z)-plane, hence l = x. The derivative of K in the direction of l along branch 1, \u2207\u22a5 K, is\nzero due to mirror symmetry. On branch 3 the surface is\nflat and thus the stress tensor is equal to f a,3 = \u2212\u03c3ea .\nWith this information we can calculate the total force\nF 1 + F 3 = Fsym x on the particle:\nZ\n\u0001\n1\n2\nFsym = \u03c3\u2206L \u2212 \u03ba ds K\u22a5\n(33)\n\u2212 Kk2 ,\n2 1\nwhere \u2206L \u2265 0 is the excess length of branch 1 compared\nto branch 3. If \u03ba = 0, we immediately have the important general result that the force is always attractive\nirrespective of the detailed nature of the source. Unfortunately, the curvature contribution has no evident sign\nin general. However, for two parallel cylinders adhering\nto the same side of the interface the overall sign becomes\nobvious, as long as the particles are long enough such\nthat end effects can be neglected: the contribution Kk2\nthen vanishes because branch 1 becomes a line. For the\nsame reason \u2206L = 0. This leads to the formula\n1\n2\nFsym,cyl /L = \u2212 \u03baK\u22a5\n,\n(34)\n2\nwhere L is the length of one cylinder. Thus, the two\ncylinders repel each other.\nb. Antisymmetric case. Here branch 1 is a twofold\nsymmetry axis and, as we have seen above, Kk = K\u22a5 =\n0. While the sign of \u2207\u22a5 Kk is not obvious, the derivative \u2207\u22a5 K\u22a5 is smaller than zero because K\u22a5 changes sign\nfrom positive to negative. The profile on the midline\nis always tilted by the angle \u03c6(s) in the direction indicated in Fig. 3, because any geometry with more than\none nodal point in the height function between the particles is expected to possess a higher energy. We fix the\nhorizontal separation of the particles and allow other degrees of freedom, such as height or tilt, to equilibrate (see\nSec. IV C). The force on the particle is therefore parallel\nto x, F antisym = Fantisym x, and given by\nZ\nh\n\u0001\nds \u03c3 cos \u03c6(s) \u2212 1\nFantisym =\n1\n\u0001i\n\u2212\u03ba sin \u03c6(s) \u2207\u22a5 K\u22a5 + Kk , (35)\n\n\f8\nwhere we have used x*l = cos \u03c6 and x*n = \u2212 sin \u03c6 at the\nmidpoint. Note that in this case the tension contribution\nis repulsive. As before, the sign of the curvature term is\nnot obvious.\nIf we restrict ourselves to the case of two parallel cylinders adhering to opposite sides of the interface, however, then \u2207\u22a5 Kk vanishes at the midpoint. Furthermore,\n|f a | is constant on each of the three free membrane segments (due to Eqn. (6a)). The stress tensor at branch 1,\nf \u22a5 := f a,1 , must be horizontal to the x axis because vertical components equilibrate to zero as mentioned above.\nLet us look at the projection of the stress tensor onto l:\nfl := f \u22a5 * l = (f \u22a5 * x)(x * l) .\n\n(36)\n\nIt follows that f \u22a5 * x = sign(fl /x * l) |f \u22a5 |. We know that\nx * l = cos \u03c6 > 0 and fl = \u2212\u03c3 < 0. Hence, f \u22a5 = \u2212|f \u22a5 |x\nat the midpoint. This reduces Eqn. (35) to\np\nFantisym,cyl /L = |f \u22a5 | \u2212 \u03c3 = \u03c3 2 + (\u03ba\u2207\u22a5 K\u22a5 )2 \u2212 \u03c3 \u2265 0 ,\n(37)\nwhich implies particle attraction. The length L is again\nthe length of one cylinder.\n\nFIG. 4: Two conical inclusions act as sources of a local membrane tilt (inset). The tilt-field-lines are illustrated qualitatively in this symmetric situation.\n\nperpendicular to branch 1, while m\u22a5 is an odd function\nand thus in particular zero everywhere on that branch.\nIt thus follows that both \u2207\u22a5 mk and \u2207k m\u22a5 vanish everywhere on branch 1. Thus we have\n1\n\nM = (\u2207\u22a5 m\u22a5 ) + (\u2207k mk ) ,\n1\n\nMab M ab = (\u2207\u22a5 m\u22a5 )2 + (\u2207k mk )2 ,\n1\n\nab\n\n2.\n\nk\n\n\u03b5 \u2207a mb = \u2207\u22a5 m \u2212 \u2207k m\n\nMembranes with tilt degree of freedom\na\n\nIn Sec. III we introduced a tangential vector field m\non the membrane, thereby modeling the degrees of freedom associated with the tilt of the lipids. The minimal\nintrinsic Hamiltonian density Eqn. (16) already gives rise\nto a quite formidable additional metric stress, Eqn. (17).\nYet, for sufficiently symmetric situations the expression\nfor the force simplifies quite dramatically, as we will now\nillustrate with another striking example.\nLet us consider two conical membrane inclusions which\nare inserted with the same orientation into a membrane\nat some fixed distance apart. Each inclusion will, due\nto its up-down-asymmetry, act as a local source of tilt.\nProvided the membrane is not in a spontaneously tilted\nphase, this tilt will decay with some characteristic decay\nlength as described at the end of Sec. III. A typical situation may then look like the one depicted in Fig. 4. What\ncan we say about the forces between the two inclusions\nmediated by the tilt field?\nFollowing the same reasoning as for the geometrical\nforces discussed above, and remembering that the tilt\nvanishes on branch 3 so that its contribution vanishes,\nwe find\nZ\nab\neb ,\n(38)\nF m = \u2212 ds la Tm\n1\n\nab\nwith Tm\ngiven by Eqn. (17). To simplify this expression,\nwe need to have a close look at the symmetry. For this\nit is very helpful to again expand vectors and tensors in\na local orthonormal frame (l, t), just as we have done in\nthe geometrical case above. Mirror symmetry then informs us that mk is an even function along the direction\n\n\u22a5\n\n= 0,\n\n(39a)\n(39b)\n(39c)\n\nwhere the \"1\" above the equation signs reminds us that\nthis only holds on branch 1. We next need to look at\nthe contractions of the individual terms in the metric\nmaterial stress with la eb . We find:\n1\n\nla (\u2207c ma )(\u2207c mb )eb = (\u2207\u22a5 m\u22a5 )2 l ,\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\n1\n\n\u22a5 2\n\nla (\u2207 mc )(\u2207 m )eb = (\u2207\u22a5 m ) l ,\n1\n\nla M M ab eb = M (\u2207\u22a5 m\u22a5 ) l .\n\n(40a)\n(40b)\n(40c)\n\nThe two terms involving the derivatives mc \u2207c can be\nrewritten by extracting a total derivative:\n1\n\nla mc (\u2207c M )g ab eb = l mk \u2207k M\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\n= l \u2207k (mk M ) \u2212 (\u2207k mk )M . (41a)\nThe total derivative will yield a boundary term once integrated along branch 1, and since we assume that we are\nnot in a spontaneously tilted phase, |ma | will go to zero\nat infinity and thus the boundary term vanishes. With\nthe same argument we find\n\u0002\n1\nla mc (\u2207c M ab )eb = l \u2207k (mk (\u2207\u22a5 m\u22a5 ))\n\n\u0003\n\u2212 (\u2207k mk )(\u2207\u22a5 m\u22a5 ) . (41b)\n\nAgain, the total derivative integrates to zero. Finally,\nthe potential terms simplify to\n1\n\n(42a)\n\n1\n\n(42b)\n\nla V (m2 )g ab eb = V (m2 ) l ,\nla V \u2032 (m2 )ma mb eb = 0 .\n\n\f9\nCollecting all results, we arrive at the remarkably simple\nexact force expression F m = Fm x, with\nZ\ni\nh\n\u0001\n1\nFm = \u2212 2 \u03bb + \u03bc\nds (\u2207\u22a5 m\u22a5 )2 \u2212 (\u2207k mk )2\n1\nZ\n+\nds V (m2 ) .\n(43)\n1\n\nThere are two contributions to the force, one stemming\nfrom gradients of the tilt, the other from the tilt potential\nV . Remarkably, the tilt gradient contribution from each\nof the first two quadratic invariants has the same structural form, thus the Lam\u00e9 coefficients \u03bb and \u03bc occur only\nas a combination in front of the integral. The modulus \u03bd\nhas dropped out since the corresponding stress vanishes\non the mid-curve (see Eqn. (39c)).\nThe structural similarity of Eqn. (43) to curvature\nmediated forces \u2013 Eqn. (33) \u2013 is very striking. Since\n1\n2 \u03bb + \u03bc > 0 [35], the first integral states that perpendicular gradients of the perpendicular tilt lead to repulsion,\nwhile parallel gradients of the parallel tilt imply attractions \u2013 the same \"\u22a52 \u2212k2 \" motif as found in Eqn. (33).\nSince in the untilted phase V (m2 ) \u2265 0, the second line\nshows that the integrated excess potential drives attraction, just as the excess length (something like an integrated \"surface tilt\") drives attraction in Eqn. (33). Unfortunately, the overall sign of the force is not obvious.\nLooking at the field lines in Fig. 4, the visual analogy\nwith electrostatic interactions between like charged particles would suggest a repulsion, but the above analysis\nadvises caution (in Sec. VI C we will see that this naive\nguess is at least borne out on the linearized level). Moreover, we should not forget that tilt does couple to geometry (namely, via the covariant derivative) and that the\nmembrane by no means needs to be flat; hence, the contribution due to tension and bending given by Eqn. (33)\nmust be added, the sign of which is equally unclear.\n3.\n\nFurther geometric Hamiltonians\n\nWithin the framework of reparametrization invariant\nHamiltonians providing a scalar energy density, a systematic power series in terms of all available scalars and their\ncovariant derivatives (each multiplying some phenomenological \"modulus\") is a formal (and in fact standard) way\nof obtaining an energy expression of a physical system. In\nthis respect the Hamiltonian (24) is no exception, being\nsimply the quadratic expansion for an up-down symmetric surface (notice that a term proportional to K would\nbreak this symmetry, giving rise to a spontaneous curvature). We hasten to add that a second quadratic term,\nproportional to the Gaussian (or Ricci) curvature, exists\nas well, but this usually plays no role since it only results\nin a topological invariant (see also the Appendix).\nThe fact that curvature (a \"generalized strain\") enters quadratically in the Hamiltonian (24) classifies this\nform of the bending energy as \"linear curvature elasticity\" (even though the resulting shape equations are\n\nhighly nonlinear). However, for sufficiently strong bending higher than quadratic terms will generally contribute\nto the energy density, giving rise to genuinely nonlinear\ncurvature elasticity [45]. Nevertheless, such effects pose\nno serious problem for the approach we have outlined so\nfar. In fact, they are incorporated very naturally. We\nwould like to illustrate this with two examples.\na. Quartic curvature. Sticking with up-down symmetric surfaces, the next curvature order would be quartic,\nand this gives rise to three more scalars: K 4 , K 2 R and\nR2 . Let us for simplicity only study the case of a quartic\ncontribution of the form\nH4 =\n\n1\n\u03ba4 K 4 .\n4\n\n(44)\n\nUsing the general expression of the stress tensor for the\nscalar K n as calculated in the Appendix (see Eqn. (A4))\nand going through the calculation from Sec. IV D we find\nfor instance\n3\n4\nFsym,cyl /L = \u2212 \u03ba4 K\u22a5\n,\n4\n\n(45)\n\nif two parallel cylinders adhere to the same side of the interface. This term increases the repulsion between cylinders found on the linear elastic level (see Eqn. (34)), provided \u03ba4 > 0, i. e., provided the quartic term further\nstiffens the membrane.\nAssuming that H4 perturbs the usual bending Hamiltonian 21 \u03baK 2 , we can use the two moduli to define a\np\ncharacteristic length scale l4 := |\u03ba4 |/\u03ba. The overall\nforce up to quartic order can then be written as\nh\ni\n3\n1\n2\n1 \u00b1 (l4 K\u22a5 )2 ,\n(46)\nFsym,cyl /L = \u2212 \u03baK\u22a5\n2\n2\nwhere the +-sign corresponds to stiffening. Notice that\nthe correction term becomes only noticeable once the curvature radius of the membrane is no longer large compared to the length scale l4 . It appears natural that l4\nis related to the membrane thickness, which for phospholipid bilayers is about 5 nm. Assuming a (quadratic\norder) bending stiffness of \u03ba \u2243 20 kB T , we thus expect\nvalues for the modulus \u03ba4 on the order of 103 kB T nm2 .\nb. Curvature gradients. In order length\u22124 it is possible to also generate scalars which depend on derivatives\nof the surface curvature. One such term is\nH\u2207 =\n\n1\n\u03ba\u2207 (\u2207a K)(\u2207a K) .\n2\n\n(47)\n\nUsing the expression for the stress tensor derived in the\nAppendix (see Eqn. (A14)) and again going through the\ncalculation in Sec. IV D, we find\nFsym,cyl /L =\n\n1\nd2 2\n1\n2\n\u03ba\u2207 \u22072\u22a5 K\u22a5\n= \u03ba\u2207 2 K \u22a5\n4\n4\ndl\n\n(48)\n\nfor the force between two symmetrically adhering cylinders. It depends on very subtle details of the membrane\nshape: the curvature is (roughly) a second derivative of\n\n\f10\nthe membrane position, and this we need to square and\ndifferentiate two more times. Unfortunately, the sign of\nthe interaction is not obvious here, as the second deriva2\ntive of K\u22a5\nwith respect to l may be either positive or negative. Finally, we can\np also define a characteristic length\nscale here, l\u2207 := |\u03ba\u2207 |/\u03ba. The importance of a perturbation H\u2207 of the usual bending Hamiltonian depends\non whether or not the curvature changes significantly on\nlength scales comparable to l\u2207 .\n\nV.\n\ntensor identities.

(1) the extrinsic curvature tensor\nis determined to be:\nhij\nKij = \u2212 \u221a ,\ng\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE SURFACE IN\nMONGE PARAMETRIZATION\n\nIn the previous section analytical expressions for the\nforce between two attached particles have been derived\nwhich link the force to the geometry of the surface at the\nmidplane between them. It is worthwhile reemphasizing\nthat they are exact, even in the nonlinear regime. In\nspecial cases, the sign of the interaction is also revealed.\nIf one is interested in quantitative results, however,\nshape equations need to be solved \u2013 numerically or analytically. Either way, one needs to pick a surface\nparametrization. The choice followed in essentially all\nexisting calculations in the literature is \"Monge gauge\",\nand for analytical tractability its linearized version. The\npurpose of this and the following section is to translate\nthe general covariant formalism developed so far into this\nmore familiar language. To this end we first remind the\nreader what the basic geometric objects look like in this\ngauge. We are then in a position to quantitatively study\nthree different examples of interface mediated interactions in Sec. VI.\n\nA.\n\nDefinition and properties\n\nAny surface free of \"overhangs\" can be described in\nterms of its height h(x, y) above some reference plane,\nwhich we take to be the (x, y) plane. Notice that x and y\nthus become the surface coordinates. The direction of the\nbasis vectors {x, y, z} \u2208 R3 is as described in Sec. IV C.\nThe tangent vectors on the surface are then given by\nex = (1, 0, hx)\u22a4 and ey = (0, 1, hy )\u22a4 , where hi = \u2202i h\n(i, j \u2208 {x, y}). The metric is given by\ngij = \u03b4ij + hi hj ,\n\n(49)\n\nwhere \u03b4ij is the Kronecker symbol. Observe that gij is\nnot diagonal; even though the coordinates {x, y} refer to\nan orthonormal coordinate system on the base plane, this\nproperty does not transfer to the surface they parameterize. We also define the gradient operator in the base\nplane, \u2207 := (\u2202x , \u2202y )\u22a4 . The metric determinant can then\nbe written as g = |gij | = 1 + (\u2207h)2 , and the inverse metric is given by g ij = \u03b4ij \u2212 hi hj /g. It is, perhaps, worth\nemphasizing that the latter, just as Eqn. (49), are not\n\n(51)\n\nwhere hij = \u2202i \u2202j h. Note that Eqn. (51) again is not a\ntensor equation; it provides the numerical values of the\ncomponents of Kij in Monge gauge.\nFinally, it is also possible to write the trace K of the\nextrinsic curvature tensor in Monge parametrization:\nK = \u2212\u2207 *\n\nB.\n\n\u0010 \u2207h \u0011\n.\n\u221a\ng\n\n(52)\n\nSmall gradient expansion\n\nIn Sec. VI we will be interested in surfaces that deviate only weakly from a flat plane. In this situation the\ngradient \u2207h is small, and it is sufficient to consider only\nthe lowest nontrivial order of a small gradient expansion.\nK and dA can then be written as\nK = \u2212\u22072 h + O[(\u2207h)2 ] ,\no\nn\n1\ndA = 1 + (\u2207h)2 + O[(\u2207h)4 ] dx dy .\n2\n\n(53)\n(54)\n\nTo evaluate the line integrals described in Sec. IV D we\nneed expressions for K\u22a5 and Kk as well as the derivatives\n\u2207\u22a5 K\u22a5 and \u2207\u22a5 Kk at branch 1 in Monge parametrization.\nIn the small gradient expansion, the result is simply\nK\u22a5 = \u2212hxx (0, y) ,\nKk = \u2212hyy (0, y) ,\n\n(55a)\n(55b)\n\n\u2207\u22a5 K\u22a5 = \u2212hxxx(0, y) ,\n\u2207\u22a5 Kk = \u2212hyyx(0, y) .\n\n(56a)\n(56b)\n\nas well as\n\nWe are now in a position to determine the forces between\ntwo particles in different situations.\n\nVI.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nIn this section we will illustrate the general framework\nof geometry-encoded forces by treating three important\nexamples in Monge gauge: capillary, curvature mediated,\n\n\f11\nand tilt-induced interactions. For the first two, forcedistance curves have previously been derived on the linearized level [7, 8, 11]. The route via the stress tensor\nreproduces these results with remarkable ease, thereby\nunderscoring its efficiency and also confirming its validity (at least on the linear level). To illustrate tiltmediated interactions we restrict to a simplified situation in which we neglect the coupling of membrane shape\nand tilt-order. Even if the geometry is \"trivial\" (a flat\nmembrane), the material stress tensor is not, and forces\nremain.\nBoth geometric examples are special cases of the\nHamiltonian density (24). When the gradients are small,\nthe surface energy is given by the quadratic expression:\nZ\ni\nh\n1\nH=\n(57)\ndx dy \u03ba(\u22072 h)2 + \u03c3(\u2207h)2 .\n2\nIf \u03ba = 0 this describes a soap film; if \u03ba 6= 0 it will describe\na fluid membrane.\nThe approach, traditionally followed in the literature,\nis to first determine the surface profile h(x, y) which minimizes the energy Eqn. (57). For this one must solve the\nlinear Euler-Lagrange equation\n\u0001\n(58)\n\u22072 \u22072 \u2212 l\u22122 h(x, y) = 0 ,\nwhere l is the length from Eqn. (25). In a next step,\nthe energy corresponding to this shape is evaluated by\nreinserting the solution of Eqn. (58) into the functional\n(57). This energy will depend on the relative positions\nof the bound objects. Appropriate derivatives of the energy with respect to these positions will yield the forces\nbetween the particles. By contrast our approach -\nsidestepping the need to evaluate the energy - will be to\ndetermine the force directly from the surface profile using\nthe line integral expressions for the force, Eqns. (33) and\n(35).\nA.\n\nSoap films\n\nFor a soap film, \u03ba = 0 and thus l = 0. The relevant\nEuler-Lagrange equation is therefore the Laplace equation, \u22072 h = 0.\nConsider first the symmetrical configuration consisting of two parallel cylindrical particles which adhere to\none side of the soap film. Eqn. (33) indicates that, if\nwe neglect end effects, the force between the cylinders is\nproportional to the excess length on branch 1. The excess length, however, is zero because the contact lines are\nstraight. Therefore, the force is also zero. Likewise, in\nthe antisymmetric configuration with adhesion on opposite sides, the soap film between the cylinders will be flat\nif the vertical particle displacements are allowed to equilibrate. Therefore, \u03c6(s) = 0 (see Fig. 3) and Eqn. (35)\nwill yield a zero force exactly as in the symmetric case.\nIn an analogous way one obtains the same result for the\ncase of two spheres.\n\n\u03c1\na\n\u03c60\n\n\u03c6\n\nFIG. 5: Definition of the coordinates for a single quadrupole\n(viewed from above).\n\nThe situation is less simple if the film is pinned to the\nparticle surface. Let us consider two spherical particles\nof radius a with a contact line that departs only weakly\nfrom a circle.\nStamou et al. [7] have studied this case by using a superposition ansatz in the spirit of Nicolson [46]: first,\nthe height function of one isolated particle is determined\nwith the correct boundary conditions. Then, the complete height function is assumed to be the sum of the two\nsingle-particle fields of each of the two colloids. Strictly\nspeaking, this approach destroys the boundary conditions\nat the particles' contact lines; it does, however, give the\ncorrect leading order result for large separation [47].\nUsing polar coordinates \u03c1 and \u03c6, the solution of the\nshape equation outside a single spherical particle can be\nwritten as [7]\n\u0010a\u0011\nhsphere (\u03c1, \u03c6) = A0 ln\n\u03c1\n\u221e\n\u0010 a \u0011m\nX\n, (59)\n+\nAm cos [m(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6m,0 )]\n\u03c1\nm=1\nwith multipole coefficients Am and phase angles \u03c6m,0 .\nThe former can be determined as follows: The monopole\nA0 vanishes because there is no external force such as\ngravity pulling on the particle. The dipole coefficient A1\ncharacterizes the tilt of the contact line relative to the z\naxis; it also vanishes if there is no external torque acting\non the sphere. All higher multipole coefficients can be\nread off from the Fourier expansion of the contact line\nat \u03c1 = a. It is intuitively obvious and indeed confirmed\nby a more careful calculation [7, 8] that the quadrupole\ndominates the energy at lowest order.\nOne can therefore restrict the calculation to the singleparticle height function [7]\nhsphere (\u03c1, \u03c6) = Q cos[2(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 )]\n\n\u0010 a \u00112\n\u03c1\n\n,\n\n(60)\n\nwhere \u03c60 := \u03c62,0 is the angle that represents the rotation\nof the particle about z (see Fig. 5).\nIf the complete height function is a superposition, as\ndescribed above, the force on the left particle in lowest\norder has been found to be [7, 8]\nF sym,soap = \u2212F antisym,soap = 48\u03c0\u03c3Q2\n\na4\nx,\nd5\n\n(61)\n\n\f12\ny\n\nThe height function between the particles is given by\nh(x, y) = Qa2 \u00d7\n\u001a cos [2(arctan y )]\nd\n+x\n\n\u03c6 0,A\n\n2\n\ny 2 + ( d2 + x)2\n\n\u03c6 0,B\nA\n\nhx (0, y) = \u2212\n\nx\n\nFIG. 6: Two quadrupoles on a soap film (viewed from above).\n\nfor the symmetric (\u03c60,A = \u2212\u03c60,B ) and the antisymmetric\n(\u03c60,A = 0, \u03c60,B = \u03c0/2) configurations (see Fig. 6).\nLet us now examine the same two configurations using\nthe line integral representation for the force.\na.

(65) yields a force which again\nagrees with the one obtained in Eqn. (61).\nAs an example, let us look at colloids with a radius of\n1 \u03bcm trapped at the air-water interface (\u03c3 \u2243 70 mN/m),\nwhich have a pinning quadrupole of 1% of their radius\n(Q \u2243 10 nm). At a separation of 3 \u03bcm they feel an (attractive or repulsive) force of 1 pN, and at a separation\nof about 16 \u03bcm their interaction energy is comparable\nto the thermal energy. These forces are not particularly\nstrong, but they act over an exceptionally long range.\nB.\n\nFluid Membranes\n\n\u2212L/2\n\nnZ\n\nL/2\n\ndy\n\n\u2212L/2\n\nh1\n2\n\nh2y (0, y) + O[(\u2207h)4 ]\n\nio\n\n.

Using the energy route, Weikl\n[11] shows that, at lowest order in the small gradient\nexpansion, the energy per unit length of the cylinder is\n[48]\nEsym,cyl (d) = \u2212\n\n(\u03ba + 2R2 U )2 (tanh\n\u221a\n4 \u03c3\u03baR2\n\nd\n2l\n\n\u2212 1)\n\n.\n\n(68)\n\nHere R is the cylinder radius, U is the adhesion energy\nper unit area, l is the characteristic length defined in\nEqn. (25), and d is the distance between the two centers\nof the cylinders. To obtain the force per unit length L of\nthe left cylinder, we differentiate Eqn. (68) with respect\nto d [49]:\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u03ba + 2R2 U\n1\n.\n(69)\nFsym,cyl /L = \u2212 \u03ba\nd\n2\n2\u03baR cosh 2l\nThe cylinders always repel.\nWe would now like to determine the force using the line\nintegral of the corresponding stress tensor. Rewriting the\nrelevant Eqn. (34) in small gradient expansion yields (see\nEqn. (55a)):\n1\nFsym,cyl /L = \u2212 \u03bah2xx (0) .\n2\n\n(70)\n\n\f13\nWe use the expression for h given in Ref.

(70) reproduces the force\ngiven by Eqn. (69).\nb. Antisymmetric case. For two cylinders on opposite\nsides of the membrane the energy is given by [11, 48]\nEantisym,cyl (d) = \u2212\n\nd\n(\u03ba + 2R2 U )2 (coth 2l\n\u2212 1)\n\u221a\n,\n2\n4 \u03c3\u03baR\n\nwhich gives a force on the left cylinder [49]\n\u00132\n\u0012\n1\n\u03ba + 2R2 U\n.\nFantisym,cyl /L = \u03ba\nd\n2\n2\u03baR sinh 2l\n\n(73)\n\n(74)\n\nThe small gradient expansion of Eqn.

III shows that lipid tilt order,\ndescribed by the surface vector field ma , influences the\nshape of the membrane, even if the Hamiltonian density does not contain an explicit coupling of ma to the\nextrinsic curvature. The coupled system of differential\nequations (18) poses a formidable task, clearly exceeding\nthe already substantial one for the undecorated shape\nequation alone.\nOur priority is to illustrate the workings of the general formalism, therefore we will limit the discussion to\na simple case where the analytical treatment is rather\ntransparent: we will assume that the membrane itself remains flat, such that the energy density stems exclusively\nfrom lipid tilt (as described by Hm from Eqn. (16)). This\nis not a self-consistent approximation, but should give a\ngood description in the limit in which the tilt moduli \u03bb\nand \u03bc are significantly \"softer\" than the bending modulus. In this case the inclusions we have talked about in\nSec. IV D 2 will predominantly excite tilt and not bend.\nMore sophisticated (analytical and numerical) studies of\nlipid tilt and mediated interactions exist, which provide\nbetter quantitative answers [24].\nFor flat membranes, the Euler-Lagrange equation (19)\nreduces to\n(\u03bb + \u03bc)\u2207\u2207 * m + \u03bc\u22072 m \u2212 2V \u2032 m = 0 ,\n\n(78)\n\nwhere m is the 2d tilt vector in the membrane plane. Focusing first on one inclusion, the situation acquires cylindrical symmetry. Writing m(r) = m(r)er and restricting\nto the untilted membrane phase, for which the tilt potential is sufficiently well represented by V (m2 ) = 12 tm2\nwith t > 0, Eqn. (78) reduces to a simple Bessel equation\n\n(77)\n\nInserting this into Eqn. (75) reproduces the result (74).\nHow big are these forces? As an example, let us look\nat an actin filament (R \u2243 4 nm) adsorbed onto a membrane with a typical bending stiffness \u03ba \u2243p\n20 kB T , where\nkB T is the thermal energy. Noting that 2U/\u03ba will be\nthe contact curvature at the point where the membrane\ndetaches from the adsorbing filament [50] and that this\nshould not be too much smaller than the bilayer thickness in order for a Helfrich treatment to be permissible,\nwe take 2U R2 /\u03ba \u2243 1 as an upper limit. We then find that\ntwo adsorbed actin filaments at a distance d \u2243 l (where\napproximately sinh \u2248 cosh \u2248 1) feel a force of about\n2 \u2212 3 pN/nm. Alternatively, we can calculate at what\ndistance the interaction energy per persistence length of\nthe filament (lp \u2248 15 \u03bcm) is of order kB T . Using a typical value for cell membranes of l \u2248 50 nm, we obtain a\nseparation of about 0.7 \u03bcm. This is huge, and should remind us of the fact that on this scale a lot of membrane\nfluctuations will occur which we have neglected. Still, it\nshows rather vividly that membrane mediated forces can\nbe very significant.\n\nx2 m\u2032\u2032 + xm\u2032 \u2212 (x2 + 1)m = 0 ,\n\n(79)\n\nwhere x = r/lm , lm is the length defined in Eqn. (23),\nand the prime denotes a derivative with respect to x. The\nsolution is\nm(r) = m0\n\nK1 (r/lm )\n,\nK1 (r0 /lm )\n\n(80)\n\nwhere r0 is the radius of the inclusion, m0 the value of\nthe tilt at this point, and K\u03bd a modified Bessel function\nof the second kind [51]. As anticipated, the tilt decays\nessentially exponentially with a decay length of lm .\nObtaining the exact tilt field for two inclusions is very\ndifficult, since satisfying the boundary conditions is troublesome. However, if we again use the Nicolson approximation [46] and assume that the total tilt distribution\nis given by the superposition of two solutions of the kind\n(80), things become manageable. The tilt-mediated force\nbetween two symmetric inclusions is then obtained by inserting the appropriate values and derivatives of the tilt\nfield m(x, y) on the mid-line into Eqn. (43). After some\n\n\f14\nstraightforward calculations we get the force [52]\nZ \u221e\n1\n\u00d7\nFm = 4tlm m\u22172\nd\u03be p\n0\n2\n\u03be \u03be \u2212 d\u22172\nd\u2217\nh\ni\n(\u03be 2 \u2212 2d\u22172 )K0 (\u03be)K2 (\u03be) + (\u03be 2 \u2212 d\u22172 )K12 (\u03be)\n= \u22122\u03c0tlm m\u22172\n0 K1 (d/lm ) .\n\n(81)\n\nwhere m\u22170 = m0 /K1 (r0 /lm ), d\u2217 = d/2lm, and d is the\nseparation between the inclusions. As we see, the force is\nrepulsive and decays essentially exponentially with distance over a decay length of lm . Integrating it, we get\nthe repulsive interaction potential\nUm (d) = 2\u03c0tl2m m\u22172\n0 K0 (d/lm ) .\n\n(82)\n\nLet us try to make a very rough estimate of how big\nsuch a force might be. For this we need to obtain some\nplausible values for the numbers entering into Eqn. (81).\nFor t we may use the equipartition theorem and argue\nthat 12 thm2 ia = 21 kB T , where a is the area per lipid and\nkB T the thermal energy. Assuming that the root-meansquare fluctuations of m are 10\u25e6 and using the typical\nvalue a \u2243 0.75 nm2 , we get t \u2243 40 kB T /nm2 . Assuming further a rather conservative tilt decay length of the\norder of the bilayer thickness, i. e. lm \u2243 5 nm, that the\ninclusion has a radius of r0 \u2243 3 nm and imposes there\na local tilt of m \u2243 0.2, we find that two inclusions at a\ndistance of 10 nm feel a significant force of about 17 pN.\nAnd at a distance of d \u2248 22 nm their mutual potential\nenergy is 1 kB T compared to the separated state. Notice\nthat this is much larger than the Debye length in physiological solution, which is typically only 1 nm. Hence,\ntilt-mediated forces can compete with more conventional\nforces, such as (screened) electrostatic interactions. It\nshould be kept in mind, however, that if we permit the\nmembrane to bend, some of the tilt strain can be relaxed,\nthereby lowering the energy.\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have shown how the stress tensor can be used to\nrelate the forces between particles bound to an interface directly to the interface geometry. In this approach,\nthe force on a particle is given by a line integral of the\nstress along any closed contour surrounding the particle.\nThe stress depends only on the local geometry; thus the\nforce is completely encoded in the surface geometry in\nthe neighborhood of the curve.\nThe relationship between the force and the geometry provided by the line integral is exact. In the linear regime, as we have shown for selected examples in\nthe previous section, the force determined by evaluating\nthis line integral reproduces the result obtained by the\nmore familiar energy based approach. Unlike the latter,\nhowever, our approach permits us to consider large deformations. The expression for the line-integral is fully\n\ncovariant, involving geometrical tensors; one is not limited to any one particular parametrization of the surface\nsuch as the Monge gauge. Indeed, as we have seen the\ngeometrical origins of the force can get lost in this gauge.\nAs we have emphasized previously, this approach is not\na substitute for solving the nonlinear field equations. To\nextract numbers, we do need to solve these equations.\nBut even before this is done, the line integral expression\ncan provide valuable qualitative information concerning\nthe nature of the interactions between particles. This is\nbecause the geometry along the contour is often insensitive to the precise conditions binding the particle to the\ninterface. This contrasts sharply with the energy based\napproach; there, one needs to know the entire distribution of energy on the interface before one can say anything about the nature of the interaction. As we have\nseen in the context of a symmetrical two-particle configuration, it is sometimes relatively easy to identify qualitative properties of the geometry; it is virtually impossible to make corresponding statements about the energy\noutside the linear regime.\nThe stress tensor approach also has the virtue of combining seamlessly with any approach we choose, be it\nanalytical or numerical, to determine the surface shape.\nThus, for instance, one can find surfaces that minimize\na prescribed surface energy functional using the program\n\"Surface Evolver\" [53]. The evaluation of the force via a\nline integral involving the geometry along the contour is\nstraightforward; in contrast, the evaluation of the energy\ninvolves a surface integral, and the forces then follow by\na subsequent numerical differentiation. In other words,\nthe route via the energy requires one more integration\nbut also one more differentiation. This appears neither\neconomical nor numerically robust.\nWe have illustrated how internal degrees of freedom on\nthe membrane can be incorporated within this approach\nusing a vector order parameter describing lipid tilt as an\nexample. It is indeed remarkable just how readily nongeometrical degrees of freedom can be accommodated\nwithin this geometrical framework. Here again, new exact non-linear expressions for the force between particles\nmediated by the tilt are obtained which are beyond the\nscope of the traditional approach to the problem. Various patterns emerge which could not have been guessed\nfrom inspection of the Hamiltonian, in particular the existence of a \"\u22a52 \u2212k2 \" motif common to the geometrical\nand tilt mediated forces between symmetrical particles.\nWe have considered the force between a pair of particles. However, the interaction between more than two\nparticles is generally not expressible as a sum over pairwise interactions; superposition does not hold if the theory is nonlinear (see Ref. [15] for a striking illustration).\nThis, however, poses no difficulty for the stress tensor\napproach, because the underlying relation between surface geometry and force is independent of whether or not\na pair-decomposition is possible (see Fig. 7). For certain symmetric situations a clever choice of the contour\nof integration may again yield expressions for the force\n\n\f15\nAPPENDIX A:\n\nIn Sec. II D we derived the general expression\nf a = (T ab \u2212 Hac Kcb )eb \u2212 \u2207b Hab n\n\nz\ny\nl\n\nt\n\nx\n\nFIG. 7: Three-body interactions. The force on one particle\ncan be obtained by integrating the surface stress tensor along\na line of integration enclosing that particle. (cf. Eqn. (12)).\n\nanalogous to those obtained in Sec. IV D.\nMulti-body effects become particularly relevant when\none considers 2D bulk phases as, for instance, in a system\nconsisting of a large number of mutually repulsive particles adhering to one side of an interface. In this case it\nis possible to identify expressions for state variables such\nas the lateral pressure by exploiting the approach which\nhas been introduced here.\nThe interfaces we have considered are asymptotically\nflat and thus support no pressure difference. At first\nglance it may appear that our approach fails if there is\npressure because the stress tensor is no longer divergence\nfree on the free surface (one has \u2207a f a = P n) which\nwould obstruct the deformation of the contour described\nin Sec. IV C. As we will show in a forthcoming publication, however, it is possible to adapt our approach to\naccommodate such a situation.\nThe interactions we have examined correspond to particles whose orientations are in equilibrium. The additional application of an external torque (e. g. on two\ndipoles via a magnetic field) will introduce a bending moment. It is, however, possible to treat such a situation\nwith the tools provided in Ref. [28]: Just as translational\ninvariance gives us the stress tensor, rotational invariance\ngives us a torque tensor. Its contour integrals provide us\nwith the torque acting on the patch one encircles.\nFinally, genuine capillary forces involve gravity. The\nassociated energy, however, depends not only on the geometry of the surface but also on that of the bulk (it is a\nvolume force). The results thus differ qualitatively from\nthose presented here. This will be the subject of future\nwork.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Riccardo Capovilla for interesting discussions.

In this appendix we will\nspecialize (A1) to a few important standard cases.\na. Area. The simplest case is the area, H = 1, which\nis (up to a constant prefactor) the Hamiltonian density\nof a soap film. We evaluate Hab and T ab appearing in\nEqn. (A1) using Eqn. (7): Hab = \u03b4H/\u03b4Kab = 0 and\nT ab = \u2212g ab ; for T ab we use the identity\n\u221a\n\u2202 g\n1 \u221a ab\n=\ngg .\n(A2)\n\u2202gab\n2\nThus we get\nf a = \u2212g ab eb .\n\n(A3)\n\nNote that the functional derivatives \u03b4 in this case are\nequal to partial derivatives \u2202 because H does not depend\non higher derivatives of gab or Kab .\nb. Powers of K. For the Hamiltonian density H =\nK n = (g ab Kab )n one derives [54]: Hab = nK n\u22121 g ab and\nT ab = 2nK n\u22121 K ab \u2212 K n g ab which gives\nf a = (nK n\u22121 K ab \u2212 K n g ab )eb \u2212 n(\u2207a K n\u22121 )n . (A4)\nThe case n = 2 is needed in Eqn. (24).\nc. Einstein-Hilbert action. Canham [42] originally\nused the quadratic Hamiltonian H = Kab K ab . For\nthis one we easily see that Hab = 2K ab and T ab =\n\u2212Hg ab + 4Kca K bc [54]. Using the contractions of both\nGauss-Codazzi-Mainardi equations (3) as well as the\nfact that the Euler-Lagrange derivative E(H) is linear\nin the Hamiltonian, we get with the help of Eqn. (9) the\nEuler-Lagrange derivative of the Einstein-Hilbert action,\nH = R:\nE(R) = E(K 2 ) \u2212 E(Kab K ab ) = \u22122K ab Gab .\n\n(A5)\n\nHere, Gab = Rab \u2212 12 Rgab is the Einstein tensor, which\nvanishes identically in two dimensions. Thus, surface\nvariations of K 2 and Kab K ab differ only by boundary\nterms (in accord with the Gauss-Bonnet theorem [25]).\nIn higher dimensions, however, E(R) \u221d Gab is a nontrivial result, and the above seemingly inelegant (since\nextrinsic) derivation is after all remarkably economical.\nd. Curvature gradient. The next example we consider is the Hamiltonian density H = 21 (\u2207c K)(\u2207c K) \u2261\n1\n2\nab\nand\n2 (\u2207K) . Now we need to keep in mind that H\nT ab are functional derivatives\n\u0010 \u2202H \u0011\n\u2202H\n\u03b4H\n,\n(A6)\n=\n\u2212 \u2207c\nHab =\n\u03b4Kab\n\u2202Kab\n\u2202\u2207c Kab\nbecause H depends on derivatives of Kab . We obtain\nHab = \u2212\u2207c (g ab \u2207c K) = \u2212g ab \u2206K .\n\n(A7)\n\n\f16\nThe determination of T ab is a little more difficult; to\navoid errors, let us proceed cautiouslyR and consider the\nvariation of the Hamiltonian H = 12 dA (\u2207K)2 with\nrespect to the metric gab and identify T ab at the end of\nthe calculation. The variation yields:\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n(A8)\nd2 \u03be \u03b4g [ g(\u2207K)2 ]\n\u03b4g H =\n2\nZ\no\nn \u03b4 \u221ag\n1\ng\n=\ndA\n\u221a (\u2207K)2 + \u03b4g [(\u2207K)2 ] .\n2\ng\nThe evaluation of the first term involves the reuse of\nEqn. (A2); we expand the second term [55]\n\u03b4g [(\u2207K)2 ] = \u03b4g [g ab ](\u2207a K)(\u2207b K)\nab\n\nThe first term is once more simplified via Eqn. (A2),\nwhile the second term calls for the Palatini identity [3]\n\ncd\n\n+2g (\u2207a K)\u03b4g [\u2207b (Kcd g )]\n= \u2212(\u2207a K)(\u2207b K)\u03b4gab\n+2g ab (\u2207a K)\u2207b (Kcd \u03b4g cd )\n= \u2212(\u2207a K)(\u2207b K)\u03b4gab\n\u22122g ab (\u2207a K)\u2207b (K cd \u03b4gcd ) ,\n\nfor instance look at the quadratic Hamiltonian density\nH = 21 (\u2207a ma )2 = 21 M 2 , where ma is the (contravariant) surface vector field and M = gab M ab . This term\nis purely intrinsic, hence Hab = 0. The difficult part is\nthe covariant differentiation, which acts on a vector field\nand is thus dressed with an additional Christoffel symbol. Since the latter depends on the metric and its first\npartial derivative [26], it will contribute to the variation:\nZ\n1\n\u221a\nd2 \u03be \u03b4g [ gM 2 ]\n\u03b4g H =\n2\nZ\no\nn \u03b4 \u221ag\n1\ng\n.\n=\ndA\n\u221a M 2 + \u03b4g (ma,a + \u0393aab mb )2 (A15)\n2\ng\n\n\u03b4g \u0393cab =\n\n(A9)\n\nwhere the identity \u03b4g g ab = \u2212g ac g bd \u03b4gcd is exploited\ntwice. We obtain\nZ\ni\nh1\n1\n\u03b4g H =\ndA g ab (\u2207K)2 \u2212 (\u2207a K)(\u2207b K) \u03b4gab\n2\n2\nZ\nab\n\u2212 dA g (\u2207a K)\u2207b (K cd \u03b4gcd ) .\n(A10)\nThe last term can be rewritten as\nZ\nZ\nab\ncd\ndA g (\u2207a K)\u2207b (K \u03b4gcd ) = \u2212 dA K ab \u2206K\u03b4gab\nZ\ni\nh\n(A11)\n+ dA \u2207b g ab (\u2207a K)K cd\u03b4gcd ;\nthe second term on the right hand side is a total divergence and can be cast as a boundary term. Therefore, it\ndoes not contribute to T ab . Collecting results, we find\nZ\n1\n(7b)\n\u03b4g H = \u2212\ndA T ab \u03b4gab + boundary terms , (A12)\n2\nwith\n1\nT ab = (\u2207a K) (\u2207b K) \u2212 g ab (\u2207K)2 \u2212 2K ab \u2206K . (A13)\n2\nThus, for H = 21 (\u2207K)2 we get for f a given by Eqn. (A1)\nthe remarkably compact expression\ni\nh\n1\nf a = (\u2207a K)(\u2207b K) \u2212 g ab (\u2207K)2 \u2212 K ab \u2206K eb\n2\n+ \u2207a \u2206K n .\n(A14)\ne. Vector field. As a final example let us consider\nHamiltonians of the kind introduced in Sec. III, which\nhave internal vector degrees of freedom. With the symmetric tilt-strain tensor M ab = 12 (\u2207a mb + \u2207b ma ) we can\n\n\u0003\n1 cd \u0002\ng \u2207b \u03b4gda + \u2207a \u03b4gbd \u2212 \u2207d \u03b4gab .\n2\n\n(A16)\n\nSince the \u03b4gab are the components of a tensor (they must\ndescribe a proper variation of the metric tensor), the variation \u03b4g \u0393cab is also a tensor, even though the Christoffel\nsymbol itself is not. Using Eqn. (A16), the second term\nin Eqn. (A15) can thus be rewritten as\n\u03b4g (ma,a + \u0393aab mb )2 = 2M mb \u03b4g \u0393aab\n= M mb g ad (\u2207b \u03b4gda + \u2207a \u03b4gbd \u2212 \u2207d \u03b4gab )\n= M md g ab (\u2207d \u03b4gab ) .\n(A17)\nThe derivative of \u03b4gab is removed by a final partial integration. Collecting everything, we thus find (up to irrelevant boundary terms)\nZ\nn1\n\u0002\n\u0003o\n1\n\u03b4g H =\nM 2 \u2212 \u2207d md M g ab \u03b4gab\ndA\n2\n2\nZ\no\nn 1\n1\ndA \u2212 M 2 \u2212 md \u2207d M g ab \u03b4gab . (A18)\n=\n2\n2\nThus, the metric stress tensor is\ni\n1h\nT ab = M 2 + 2mc \u2207c M g ab .\n2\n\n(A19)\n\nNotice that it is directly proportional to the metric; its\neffect in the stress tensor will thus be to renormalize the\nsurface tension.\nThe second quadratic invariant, H = Mab M ab , does\nnot provide any additional difficulties compared to 21 M 2 ,\neven though the calculation is a bit longer. One finds:\nT ab = \u2212Mcd M cd g ab + 2M M ab + 2mc \u2207c M ab\n\u2212 (\u2207c ma )(\u2207c mb ) + (\u2207a mc )(\u2207b mc ) . (A20)\nFinally, the third quadratic invariant H = 14 Fab F ab\n(with F ab = \u2207a mb \u2212 \u2207b ma ) can be treated rather easily\nby noting that Fab = \u2202a mb \u2212 \u2202b ma is independent of the\nconnection. A short calculation then shows that\n1\nT ab = F ac F bc \u2212 g ab Fcd F cd .\n4\n\n(A21)\n\n\f17\nThis is nothing but the energy-momentum tensor from\nelectrodynamics [36]. In two dimensions it can be further\nsimplified, since any antisymmetric tensor is then proportional to the epsilon-tensor: F ab = 21 \u03b5ab \u03b5cd F cd . Inserting\nthis into Eqn. (A21) and using the identity \u03b5ac \u03b5b c = g ab\n[37], we find\nT ab =\n\n\u00012\n1 ab\ng \u03b5cd \u2207c md ,\n2\n\nshowing that the stress is isotropic, just as in the case of\nthe Hamiltonian H = 21 M 2 . It will thus only renormalize\nthe surface tension and, in particular, not single out any\nspecific new directions on the membrane.\n\n(A22)\n\n[1] C. W. Misner, K. S. Thorne, and J. A.

However, further constraints imply additional\nterms. For instance, closed surfaces yield the equation\nE (H) = P , where depending on the situation P can be\nseen as the excess internal pressure or a Lagrange multiplier conjugate to a volume constraint. In either case, the\nsimple conservation law for the current f a breaks down.\n[30] Note that in equilibrium the total force acting on the\n(i)\nsurface \u03a3 is zero, whereas the different F ext do not have\nto vanish necessarily.\n[31] L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz, Theory of Elasticity,\n(Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford, 1999).\n[32] The equations of Gauss and Weingarten express changes\nof the normal and tangent vectors along the surface in\nterms of these vectors. They follow from Eqns. (1, 2) and\nread, respectively, \u2207a n = Kab eb and \u2207a eb = \u2212Kab n.\n[33] R. Capovilla and J. Guven, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter\n16, S2187 (2004).\n[34] Using the commutation relations for covariant derivatives\n[39] it is easy to see that (\u2207a mb )(\u2207b ma ) = (\u2207a ma )2 \u2212\n1\nRm2 . If m2 = 1, the Gauss-Bonnet-theorem renders the\n2\nlast term a boundary contribution, and it is then easy to\nsee that the \u03bb- and \u03bc-terms in Eqn. (16) are sufficient.\n[35] In order for the Hamiltonian density (16) to be positive\ndefinite in the strain gradient \u2207a mb , we need \u03bc > 0 and\n\u03bb + \u03bc > 0. The latter differs from the \"usual\" condition\n\u03bb + 23 \u03bc > 0 found in Ref. [31] because in the surface case\nwe only have two-dimensional tensors. The positivity of\nthe antisymmetric term requires \u03bd < 0, since the square\nof an antisymmetric matrix has negative eigenvalues.\n[36] L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz, The Classical Theory\n\n\f18\nof Fields, (Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford, 2000).\n\u221a\n[37] We may also write \u03b5ab = g \u01ebab with \u01eb12 = \u2212\u01eb21 = 1\n\u221a\nand \u01eb11 = \u01eb22 = 0. This implies \u03b5ab = g \u22121 \u01ebab . Another\nuseful identity is \u03b5ab \u03b5cd = gac gbd \u2212 gad gbc .\n[38] The converse is not always true. Had we considered two\nvector fields instead of one, ma1 and ma2 say, the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations Em1 a \u2261 0, and\nEm2 a \u2261 0 would not follow from the conservation law.\nThe two sets of Euler-Lagrange equations are required to\ndetermine the equilibrium. The conservation law alone is\nnot enough.\n[39] Given a contravariant vector V c , we have the commutation identity [\u2207a , \u2207b ]V c = Rab ce V e , for contravariant tensors of rank 2 a second Riemann tensor arises:\n[\u2207a , \u2207b ]T cd = Rab ce T ed +Rab de T ce . To obtain Eqn. (20),\nwe have also used the fact that for two-dimensional surfaces the Riemann tensor is given by Rabcd = 12 R \u03b5ab \u03b5cd =\n1\nR(gac gbd \u2212 gad gbc ).\n2\n[40] The Euler-Lagrange derivative of the F ab contribution in\nEqn. (16) is easily seen to be E\u03bd a = \u2207b Fab . Furthermore,\ndue to its asymmetry F ab is invariant under gauge transformations ma \u2192 ma + \u2207a \u039b with some arbitrary gauge\nfunction \u039b. Performing an infinitesimal transformation,\nwe get\nZ\nZ\n1\n\u03b4\u039b\ndA Fab F ab = \u2212 dA (\u2207a E\u03bd a )\u039b .\n4\n\n[41]\n\n[42]\n[43]\n[44]\n\nSince \u039b was arbitrary, \u2207a E\u03bd a must vanish identically. In\nthe corresponding electrodynamic situation E\u03bd a is proportional to the 4-current [36]; there, the same gauge\ninvariance is responsible for charge conservation.\nAny patch \u03a30 is connected via its boundary \u2202\u03a30 to its\nsurrounding surface, which will also exert forces onto \u03a30\ntransmitted through this boundary. This, however, is not\nwhat we mean by external forces. Rather, external forces\noriginate from outside the surface; an example would be\nexternal objects pushing or pulling on the patch \u03a30 .\nP. B. Canham, J. Theoret. Biol. 26, 61 (1970).\nW.

Therefore, the easier approach is presented here.\n[48] Compared to Ref. [11] we have shifted the potential such\nthat it goes to zero as d \u2192 \u221e.\n[49] The direction of the force is always opposite for the two\nparticles. Hence, if we want to encode this information\nin the sign, an additional minus sign is needed for the\nleft particle, since it moves to the negative x-direction\nupon repulsion and to the positive upon attraction, respectively.\n[50] U.

We first obtained the large-d-asymptotics of the integral and recognized this as the large-d-asymptotics of\nthe right hand side of Eqn. (81). However, Eqn. (81) indeed holds for all distances d, a fact we unfortunately\nwere only able to verify numerically.\n[53] K.\nBrakke,\nThe\nSurface\nEvolver,\n(http://www.susqu.edu/facstaff/b/brakke/evolver/evolver.html,\n2004).\n[54] One has to be careful when differentiating with respect\nto gab : the tensor Kab is an independent variable, hence\n\u2202Kab /\u2202gcd = 0; but K ab = Kcd g ac g bd depends on the\nmetric through its inverse and thus yields a nontrivial\nterm when differentiated, since \u2202g ab /\u2202gcd = \u2212 21 (g ac g bd +\ng ad g bc ).\n[55] One more warning when differentiating with respect to\ngab (cf. [54]): generally, \u2207a depends on (derivatives of)\nthe metric through the Christoffel symbols it contains\n[26]. Luckily, however, in the present situation \u2207a only\nacts on a scalar (K). It is then identical to the usual partial derivative \u2202a , i. e., it is not dressed with additional\nChristoffel symbols. On the other hand, \u2207a = g ab \u2207b always depends on the metric through its inverse.\n\n\f"}
