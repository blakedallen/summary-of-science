Introduction\nA precise measurement of gauge boson production cross-sections for pp scattering will be\ncrucial at the LHC. W and Z bosons will be produced copiously, and a careful measurement\nof their production cross-sections will be important in testing the Standard Model more\nrigorously than ever before, and uncovering signs of new physics which may appear through\nradiative corrections. In addition, these cross-sections have been proposed as a \"standard\ncandle\" for measuring the luminosity through a comparison of the measured rates to the\nbest theoretical calculations of the cross-section. Investigation of this means of measuring\nluminosity began at the Tevatron and will continue at the LHC [1, 2].\nIn a previous paper, [3] three of the authors analyzed the systematic errors in Z\nproduction using state-of-the-art computational tools. A comparable analysis of systematic\nuncertainties in W production appeared in Ref. [4]. Since that time, both the experimental\napproach to the measurements and the theoretical results needed to calculate them have\nboth been refined, so we will extend a similar analysis as in Ref. [3] to the case of the W . As\nin the case of the Z, NNLO QCD calculations of these processes, previously available only\nfor the total cross-section [5] and rapidity distribution [6], are now available in differential\nform [7], permitting an analysis of the effect of experimental cuts on the pseudorapidity and\ntransverse momentum of the final state charged lepton and missing energy of the neutrino.\nThe high luminosity (1033 \u2212 1034 cm2 s\u22121 ) at the LHC insures that systematic errors\nwill play a dominant role in determining the accuracy of the cross-section. Thus, we present\nan analysis of the effect of the theoretical uncertainty in the evaluation of the acceptance,\nand propose which among the various available MC generators and computational schemes\nshould be implemented to best simulate the events.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fThis paper is organized as follows. Sec. 2 will give an overview of the calculation and\nthe computational tools used in the analysis. The next four sections are each devoted to\nestimating a class of systematic errors: electroweak corrections in Sec. 3, NNLO QCD in\nSec. 4, QCD scale dependence in Sec. 5, and parton distribution function uncertainties in\nSec. 6. Finally, the results are compiled and summarized in Sec. 7.\n\n2. Theoretical Calculations and MC Generators\nThe dominant production mechanism for Z or W bosons is the Drell-Yan process [8], in\nwhich a quark and antiquark annihilate to form a vector boson, which subsequently decays\ninto a lepton pair. The W production process is actually observed through the charged\nlepton and missing energy of the neutrino produced in its decay. In general, the crossobs of observed events via the relation\nsection may be inferred from the number NW\nZ\nobs\ntot\n(2.1)\nNW = \u03c3 BR(W \u2192 l\u03bd)AW Ldt.\nAW is the acceptance obtained after applying the experimental selection criteria. For\nexample, if the cuts require pT > pTmin , 0 < \u03b7 l < \u03b7 max , and E\n/T > E\n/Tmin , then\nZ \u221as/2\nZ \u221as/2\n1\nl\ndp\ndpT \u03bd\nAW (pT min, \u03b7 max ) = tot\nmin\n\u03c3 BR(W \u2192 l\u03bd) p min T E\n/T\nT\nZ \u221e\nZ \u03b7\n4\nmax\nd \u03c3\nd\u03b7l\nd\u03b7\u03bd\n\u00d7\nBR(W \u2192 l\u03bd) ,\nl\ndpT dpT \u03bd d\u03b7l d\u03b7\u03bd\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2212\u03b7 max\n\n(2.2)\n\nAlternatively to the W production cross-section measurement, the corrected W yield\ncan be used as a standard candle for a luminosity monitor in LHC if one calculates the\nR\ncross-section and solves for Ldt. The theoretical cross-section may be constructed by\nconvoluting a parton-level cross-section \u03c3\nbab for partons a and b with the parton density\nfunctions (PDFs) fa , fb for these partons,\nXZ 1\nth\n\u03c3 BR(W \u2192 l\u03bd) =\ndx1 dx2 fa (x1 )fb (x2 ) \u03c3\nbab (x1 , x2 ),\n(2.3)\na,b\n\n0\n\nintegrating over the momentum fractions x1 , x2 , and applying cuts relevant to the experiment. Theoretical errors come from limitations in the order of the calculation of \u03c3ab , on\nits completeness (for example, on whether it includes electroweak corrections, on whether\nany phase space variables or spins have been averaged), and from errors in the PDFs.\nSince the final state may include additional partons which form a shower, the output\nfrom the hard QCD process must be fed to a shower generator to generate a realistic final\nstate seen in a detector. This is possible only if the cross-section is simulated in an event\ngenerator. Calculating the acceptance for all but the simplest cuts will normally require\nan event generator as well.\nThus, when constructing a simulation of an experiment, there is a range of choices\nwhich can be made among the tools currently available. An efficient calculation requires\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fselecting those adequate to meet the anticipated precision requirements, without performing unnecessarily complex calculations. For example, while NNLO calculations are now\navailable, the cross-sections are very complicated, do not always converge well, and require\nsubstantial time to calculate. For certain choices of cuts, it may be found that the effect of\nthe NNLO result can be minimized, or that it can be represented by a simplified function\nfor the parameters of interest. We will compare several possible schemes for calculating\nthe W production cross-section and acceptance, and consider the systematic errors arising\nfor these schemes.\nThe most basic way to generate events is through one of the showering programs, such\nas PYTHIA [9], HERWIG [10], ISAJET [11] or SHERPA [12]. These vary somewhat in\ntheir assumptions and range of effects included, but they all start with hard partons at a\nhigh energy scale and branch to form partons at lower scales, which permits a description\nof hadronization and realistic events. On their own, these programs typically rely on a\nleading order hard matrix element and include only a leading-log resummation of soft\nand collinear radiation in the shower, limiting their value in describing events with large\ntransverse momentum. In addition, ISAJET lacks color-coherence, which is important in\npredicting the correct distribution of soft jets [13].\nFully exclusive NLO QCD calculations are available for W and Z boson production [14].\nThe MC generator MC@NLO [15] combines a parton-level NLO QCD calculation with the\nHERWIG [10] parton shower, thus removing some of the limitations of a showering program\nalone.\nSince \u03b1 \u2248 \u03b12s at LHC energies, NLO electroweak (EWK) corrections should appear at\nthe same order as NNLO QCD. The MC@NLO package is missing EWK corrections, but\nthe contribution of final state radiation (FSR) can be obtained by combining MC@NLO\nwith PHOTOS [16], an add-on program which generates multi-photon emission from events\ncreated by the host program. In the case of Z exchange, FSR was expected to be the\ndominant contribution. [17] Another program, HORACE [18], is available which includes\nexact O(\u03b1) EWK corrections together with a final state QED parton shower. It was\nconfirmed [3] that PHOTOS and HORACE agree within 1% for Z production. However,\nfor W production, the W itself can radiate, so we should expect that the agreement may\nnot be so close in this case. Recent studies [19] have emphasized the importance of the\ninterplay between QCD and EWK corrections, particularly in the high pT tail important\nfor new physics searches.\nThe other available NLO and NNLO calculations are implemented as MC integrations, which can calculate a cross-section but do not provide unweighted events. Some of\nthese are more differential than others. For example, the NNLO rapidity distribution is\navailable in a program Vrap [6], but this distribution alone is not sufficient to calculate\nacceptances with cuts on the lepton pseudorapidities and transverse momenta. A differential version of this NNLO calculation is implemented in a program FEWZ [7], but this\nis not an event generator. Another available program is ResBos-A [20], which resums soft\nand collinear initial state QCD radiation to all orders and includes NLO final state QED\nradiation. Resummation is expected to have advantages in realistically describing the small\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fpT regime [20].\nOur analysis is conducted for di-lepton final states. The available calculations typically\nset the lepton masses to zero, so the lepton masses will be neglected throughout this paper\nand the choice of final state lepton has no effect on the calculations. In all results, l may be\ninterpreted as either an electron or muon, \u03bd the appropriate accompanying (anti)neutrino,\nand we consider the case of W \u00b1 production separately. We have chosen three sets of\nexperimental cuts to reflect detector capabilities and to demonstrate the impact of physics\neffects on the acceptances depending on the selection criteria.\n\n3. Electroweak Corrections\nAs noted above, both NNLO QCD corrections and NLO electroweak (EWK) corrections\nare expected to be needed to reach precisions on the order of 1% or better in W boson\nproduction. NLO electroweak[21] and QCD corrections[14] are known both for W boson\nproduction and Z boson production. However, current state-of-the-art MC generators\ndo not include both sets of corrections. The generator MC@NLO [15] combines a MC\nevent generator with NLO calculations of rates for QCD processes and uses the HERWIG\nevent generator for the parton showering, but it does not include EWK corrections. Final\nstate QED can be added using PHOTOS [16], a process-independent module for adding\nmulti-photon emission to events created by a host generator. However, some O(\u03b1) EWK\ncorrections are still missing, in particular radiation from the charged W itself, which was\nnot an issue in Z production.\nTo study the error arising from missing O(\u03b1) EWK corrections, we used HORACE [18],\na MC event generator that includes initial and final-state QED radiation in a photon shower\napproximation and exact O(\u03b1) EWK corrections matched to a leading-log QED shower.\nTo determine the magnitude of the error, we then compared the results from this generator\nto a Born-level calculation with final-state QED corrections added by PHOTOS.\nSpecifically, we compared pp \u2192 W \u2192 l\u03bd events generated by HORACE with the full\nO(\u03b1) corrections and parton-showered with HERWIG, to these events generated again by\nHORACE, but without EWK corrections (Born-level), showered with HERWIG+PHOTOS.\nCTEQ6.5M parton distribution functions [22] were used in the calculations. The results\nare shown in Tables 2 \u2013 3 and in Figs. 1 \u2013 3.\nFor Tables 2 \u2013 3, a standard set of cuts is used. We choose three sets of experimental\ncuts described in Table 1 to reflect detector capabilities and to demonstrate the impact of\nphysics effects on the acceptances depending on the selection criteria. Here, \u03b7 and pT are\nthe pseudorapidity and transverse momentum of the final state charged leptons, and E\n/T\nis the missing transverse energy carried by the neutrino.

In the following, we will evaluate the errors introduced by omitting\nthe NNLO corrections by using MC@NLO, and calculate K-factors which can be used to\nintroduce NNLO corrections to the MC@NLO calculation. We will also examine the effect\nof uncertainties in the PDFs. For these studies, we choose the same three sets of cuts as\ngiven previously in Table 1.\nWe begin by examining the NNLO corrections, using the state-of-the-art program\nFEWZ [7], which is differential in the and the lepton transverse momenta and pseudorapidities.

All results in the tables are calculated at scale MW . In the figures, the NLO\nresults are displayed as a band spanning the range of scales from MW /2 to 2MW . The\nscale dependence of the NNLO result is small enough to be comparable to the precision of\nthe MC evaluation of the integrals, so only the average of the high and low scales is plotted,\nwith error bars reflecting a combination of statistical and scale variation uncertainties.\nSince the NNLO matrix element has not yet been interfaced to a shower, we cannot\ndirectly compare FEWZ to MC@NLO. The best we can do at this time is to use MC@NLO\nto obtain the NLO showered result, and multiply this by a K-factor obtained by taking\nthe ratio of the NNLO to NLO results derived from FEWZ. This procedure is reasonable\nexcept in threshold regimes where the fixed-order NLO result in FEWZ would be unreliable.\nThis is similar to methods that have been used for calculating NNLO corrections to Higgs\nproduction [23]. The differences of these K-factors from unity are shown in Figs. 9 and 10\nfor both the cross-sections and acceptances, as a function of cuts on the lepton pT and \u03b7.\n\nCut\n\u03c3 tot\n1\n2\n3\nCut\n1\n2\n3\n\nNNLO Cross Sections \u03c3 (pb) for W \u2212 Production\nMC@NLO FEWZ NLO FEWZ NNLO\nK-factor\n9202.5 \u00b1 9.9 9450.5 \u00b1 9.2 9357.6 \u00b1 34.7 0.9902 \u00b1 0.0038\n1733.5 \u00b1 4.6 1794.0 \u00b1 1.8 1772.1 \u00b1 14.3 0.9878 \u00b1 0.0080\n1858.3 \u00b1 4.8 1950.7 \u00b1 1.9 1890.4 \u00b1 21.4 0.9691 \u00b1 0.0110\n1341.2 \u00b1 4.2 1404.1 \u00b1 1.4 1355.1 \u00b1 13.1 0.9651 \u00b1 0.0094\nNNLO Acceptances (%) for W \u2212 Production\nMC@NLO FEWZ NLO FEWZ NNLO\nK-factor\n18.84 \u00b1 0.05 18.98 \u00b1 0.03\n18.94 \u00b1 0.17\n0.9976 \u00b1 0.0090\n20.19 \u00b1 0.05 20.64 \u00b1 0.03\n20.20 \u00b1 0.24\n0.9787 \u00b1 0.0118\n14.58 \u00b1 0.05 14.86 \u00b1 0.02\n14.48 \u00b1 0.15\n0.9747 \u00b1 0.0102\n\nK\u00d7 MC@NLO\n9112.3 \u00b1 36.3\n1712.4 \u00b1 14.6\n1800.9 \u00b1 21.0\n1294.4 \u00b1 13.2\nK\u00d7 MC@NLO\n18.79 \u00b1 0.18\n19.76 \u00b1 0.24\n14.21 \u00b1 0.16\n\nTable 5: Calculation of the W \u2212 \u2192 l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304l (l = e or \u03bc) cross-section at NLO using MC@NLO, and\nat NLO and NNLO using FEWZ, for the cut region defined in Table 1.\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fLepton |\u03b7| Cut: (M > 20, pT > 25)\nT\n\n70\n\n9000\n\n7000\n\n60\nNNLO\n\nNNLO\n\n\u03c3 (pb)\n\n6000\n5000\n4000\n3000\n2000\n\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n\n1000\n0\n\nT\n\nNLO Error Band\n\nAcceptance (%)\n\n8000\n\nNLO Error Band\n\nLepton |\u03b7| Cut: (M > 20, pT > 25)\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n|\u03b7|max\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n|\u03b7|max\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6: Cross-section (a) and acceptance (b) versus cut on lepton |\u03b7| at NLO (hashed bands)\nand NNLO (points), as calculated using FEWZ for W + \u2192 l+ \u03bdl .\nLepton pT Cut: (M > 20, |\u03b7| < 1.0)\n\nLepton pT Cut: (M > 20, |\u03b7| < 1.0)\n\nT\n\nT\n\n2200\n\n22\n\nNLO Error Band\n\n2000\n\nNNLO\n\nAcceptance (%)\n\n\u03c3 (pb)\n\nNNLO\n\n18\n\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n\nNLO Error Band\n\n20\n\n1800\n\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n2\n0\n\n40\n\npT min (GeV/c)\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\npT min (GeV/c)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7: Cross-section (a) and acceptance (b) versus cut on lepton pT at NLO (hashed bands)\nand NNLO (points), as calculated using FEWZ for W \u2212 \u2192 l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304l .\n\nThe resulting accepted cross-section is shown in the K\u00d7 MC@NLO column of Tables 4 \u2013\n5 and in Figs. 11 and 12 as a function of the same cuts as in Figs. 9 and 10. The size of\nK \u2212 1 is a good indicator of the error due to missing NNLO if MC@NLO is used without\ncorrections.\nThe results in Tables 4 \u2013 5 show K-factors corresponding to an NNLO correction of\nabout 1% for the W \u00b1 cross-sections, or up to 3.5% for the Cut 3 cross-section.

Cut 1 acceptances had a 1% or less correction for both W \u00b1 .\nConvergence of he FEWZ W calculation appears better than for the Z calculation, giving\nmore rapid convergence and smaller Monte-Carlo errors in comparable run-times. Thus,\n1% evaluations were generally possible in the W calculation, but were not always practical\nin the corresponding Z calculations.[3]\nAs noted above, the CTEQ6.5M PDFs do not include NNLO corrections, it is important to check their compatibility with the NNLO calculation by repeating the calculation\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fLepton |\u03b7| Cut: (M > 20, pT > 25)\n\nLepton |\u03b7| Cut: (M > 20, pT > 25)\n\nT\n\n6000\n\nNLO Error Band\n\n60\nNNLO\n\nNNLO\n\nAcceptance (%)\n\n5000\n\n\u03c3 (pb)\n\nT\n\nNLO Error Band\n\n4000\n3000\n2000\n1000\n0\n\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n|\u03b7|max\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n|\u03b7|max\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 8: Cross-section (a) and acceptance (b) versus cut on lepton |\u03b7| at NLO (hashed bands)\nand NNLO (points), as calculated using FEWZ for W \u2212 \u2192 l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304l .\n\nCut\ncut\n\u2212\nW cut\nW + cut\nW \u2212 cut\nW + cut\nW \u2212 cut\nW+\n\n1\n1\n2\n2\n3\n3\n\nK-factors with CTEQ and\nCTEQ K(\u03c3)\nMRST K(\u03c3)\n0.9839 \u00b1 0.0069 0.9767 \u00b1 0.0081\n0.9878 \u00b1 0.0080 0.9538 \u00b1 0.0086\n0.9885 \u00b1 0.0079 0.9745 \u00b1 0.0100\n0.9691 \u00b1 0.0110 0.9712 \u00b1 0.0109\n0.9697 \u00b1 0.0080 0.9510 \u00b1 0.0097\n0.9651 \u00b1 0.0094 0.9430 \u00b1 0.0209\n\nMRST PDFs\nCTEQ K(A)\n0.9908 \u00b1 0.0079\n0.9976 \u00b1 0.0090\n0.9954 \u00b1 0.0089\n0.9787 \u00b1 0.0118\n0.9765 \u00b1 0.0089\n0.9747 \u00b1 0.0102\n\nMRST K(A)\n0.9988 \u00b1 0.0091\n0.9804 \u00b1 0.0097\n0.9966 \u00b1 0.0110\n0.9984 \u00b1 0.0119\n0.9725 \u00b1 0.0106\n0.9694 \u00b1 0.0218\n\nTable 6: Comparison of the K factors for cross-sections and acceptances calculated using\nCTEQ6.5M (NLO) and MRST 2002 (NNLO) PDFs for both W + and W \u2212 production. K(\u03c3)\nis the K-factor for the cross-section and K(A) is the K-factor for the acceptance, as displayed in\nTables 4 \u2013 5.\n\nwith MRST 2002 NNLO PDFs. It is not obvious that substituting NLO PDFs in this calculation is reasonable, but in fact, it turns out to be. The K-factors for the cross-section\nand acceptance for each of the three cuts is shown in Table 6 for both sets of PDFs. The\nK(\u03c3)-factors are ratios of NNLO to NLO cross-sections, and K(A) are ratios of NNLO\nto NLO acceptances relative to the total cross section. The agreement of the K factors\nfor the cross sections varies from less than 1% to 3.6%, with the maximum disagreement\nfor W \u2212 cut 1. The acceptances agree to within 1% except for W \u2212 cuts 1 and 2, where\nthe agreement is within 2%. There is a still some variation in the results due to the slow\nconvergence of the NNLO calculation, typically in the 1 \u2212 2% range. Only cut 1 for the\nW \u2212 has a PDF dependence outside that range, and this could still be primarily due to\nMonte Carlo errors.\n\n5.

In\na complete, all order calculation, or one completely resummed in the soft and collinear\nregimes and properly matched to the PDFs, there would be no dependence on these scales.\nHowever, in a fixed order calculation matched to PDFs, a dependence on the factorization\nscale \u03bcF and renormalization scale \u03bcR appear in the final results. The effect of scale choice\nis significant at NLO. Adding NNLO effects is found to reduce scale dependence considerably [6, 7], though it can remain significant near thresholds where NLO effectively becomes\nleading order.\nAs is customary, we will choose the renormalization and factorization scales to be\nidentical, and investigate the scale dependence by varying them by a factor of 2 or 1/2\nabout a central value of \u03bcF,R = MZ , which is typical of the scales in our acceptance, and\nwas the central value chosen in the previous section.\nTables 4 \u2013 5 included only the central scale MW .

For a measure of the size of the scale\ndependence, the final column of each table shows the maximum difference between the\nthree values divided by average, with an error calculated assuming the statistical errors in\nthe three MC runs in each row are independent.\nWe can see that the scale dependence of the cross-sections at NLO is typically of\norder \u00b16%. The scale dependence of NLO acceptances is dramatically reduced due to\ncorrelations in the scale dependence of the cut and uncut cross-sections used to compute\nit. Adding NNLO reduces the scale dependence of the cross-sections to less than 2% in\nmost cases. For some cuts, the convergence of the Monte-Carlo is a significant limitation\non the accuracy of this result, since the NNLO MC errors can be comparable to the scale\ndependence.\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fLepton pT Cut: (M > 20, |\u03b7| < 1.0)\n\nLepton |\u03b7| Cut: (M > 20, pT > 25)\n\nT\n\nT\n\n8000\n2500\n\n7000\n6000\n\n2000\n\n\u03c3NNLO\n\n\u03c3NNLO\n\n5000\n1500\n1000\n\n3000\n2000\n1000\n\n500\n0\n\n4000\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n0\n0\n\n40\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n|\u03b7|max\n\npT min (GeV/c)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 11: Accepted NNLO cross-section estimated from MC@NLO scaled by the K-factor versus\nthe lepton (a) pT , and (b) |\u03b7| cuts for W + \u2192 l+ \u03bdl .\nLepton pT Cut: (M > 20, |\u03b7| < 1.0)\n\nLepton |\u03b7| Cut: (M > 20, pT > 25)\n\nT\n\nT\n\n2200\n\n6000\n\n2000\n5000\n\n1800\n\n4000\n\n1400\n\n\u03c3NNLO\n\n\u03c3NNLO\n\n1600\n\n1200\n1000\n\n3000\n2000\n\n800\n600\n\n1000\n\n400\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n|\u03b7|max\n\npT min (GeV/c)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 12: Accepted NNLO cross-section estimated from MC@NLO scaled by the K-factor versus\nthe lepton (a) pT , and (b) |\u03b7| cuts for W \u2212 \u2192 l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304l .\n\n6. Uncertainties Due to the Parton Distribution Function\nPhenomenological parameterizations of the PDFs are taken from a global fit to data. Therefore, uncertainties on the PDFs arising from diverse experimental and theoretical sources\nwill propagate from the global analysis into the predictions for the W/Z cross-sections.\nFigure 13 and Figure 14 show the results of the inclusive W to di-lepton production crosssection using various CTEQ [22] and MRST [25] PDFs. The upward shift of about 7%\n(between CTEQ6.1 and 6.5 and MRST2004 and 2006) results from the inclusion of heavy\nquark effects in the latest PDF calculations. The acceptance due to the cuts in Table 1\nusing each of these PDFs is shown in Fig. 15 and Fig. 16.1\nThe uncertainties in the PDFs arising from the experimental statistical and systematic\nuncertainties, and the effect on the production cross-section of the W boson, have been\n1\n\nTheoretical issues which may affect the contribution of the PDFs to the NNLO K-factor are not included\nhere as we are concerned primarily with the error at NLO.

The fractional uncertainties,\nshown in in the same figures, demonstrate that the relative uncertainty in the cross-section\nis very flat as a function of the kinematic cuts, until the region of extreme cuts and low\nstatistics in the MC are reached. The corresponding uncertainty on the acceptance as a\nfunction of the kinematic cuts is shown in Figs 21 and 23 for W \u2212 and Figs 22 and 24\nfor W + . These show a similar dependence to the cross-section uncertainties, though the\nfractional errors are smaller.\n\n7. Conclusions\nTo evaluate the overall contribution from theoretical uncertainties to both the cross-section\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\fand acceptance calculations for the decay mode W \u00b1 \u2192 l\u00b1 \u03bdl (l = e or \u03bc) at the LHC we add\nthe uncertainties from each of the sources considered in the preceding sections. We compile\nthe errors assuming that the calculation is done with MC@NLO at scale \u03bcF = \u03bcR = MW\nand interfaced to PHOTOS to add final state QED radiation. The missing electroweak\ncontribution may then be inferred from HORACE as in Sec. 3. For these errors we take\nthose resulting from the tight cut set in Tables 2 \u2013 3; The cuts described in Table 1 are\nconsidered the most representative of likely analysis cuts for the LHC experiments.\nQCD uncertainties may be divided into two main classes. If the NNLO K-factor is set\nto 1, there is a missing NNLO contribution \u03b4 NNLO = K \u2212 1. Since K has residual NNLO\nscale dependence, we must also take this into account and write K = 1 + \u03b4 NNLO \u00b1 \u03b4 scale .\nThe factor \u03b4 NNLO can be inferred from Tables 4 \u2013 5 and \u03b4 scale can be inferred from half the\nscale variation of the NNLO entries in Tables 7 \u2013 9, as discussed in detail in the conclusions\nof Ref. [3].\nBoth classes of QCD errors are also associated with a \"technical precision\" due to\nlimitations of the computing tools used to evaluate them. Significant improvements in the\nNNLO precision could be obtained if a program with faster convergence were available. We\ntherefore include an \"error on the error\" for the QCD errors, and propagate these through\nin the usual fashion to derive a final accuracy for the total QCD uncertainty estimate.\nThis sets a limitation on how much the NLO calculation can realistically be improved\nusing currently available NNLO results.\nThese contributions to QCD errors are summarized in Table 12 for the total crosssection and the three cuts of Table 1. Results are shown both for the three cut cross-sections\nand their ratio for the total cross-section, and the errors are assumed to be uncorrelated.\nIf the K-factor had not been calculated at NNLO, the error of the NLO cross-sections\ncould have been roughly estimated from half the width of the scale-dependence band, or\nhalf the NLO results for \u2206\u03c3/\u03c3 in Tables 7 and 9 , giving uncertainties of 2.8 \u2212 3.2%. The\nerrors calculated from the K factors are in within the limits these expectations, up to the\ntechnical precision of the calculation. A similar error NLO estimate for the error in the\nacceptance based on Tables 8 and 10 would predict at most 0.4% missing NNLO.\nThe final contribution to the total error considered here is the uncertainty from the\nPDFs. This may be extracted from the results of Sec. 6 by taking the errors from the\nCTEQ6.5 results for Cut 1 (see Table 1). The errors are asymmetric, so we take the largest\nof the two (up or down) uncertainties as the total fractional error for the PDF calculation.\nWe choose the first cut set, since it is the most representative of likely analysis cuts at the\nLHC experiments. CTEQ errors, rather than the MRST errors, are used because they give\na more conservative estimate. The difference between the results obtained by the latest\nCTEQ and MRST PDFs is less than the maximum error quoted for CTEQ for all three\ncut regions.\nThe errors are added in quadrature, assuming no correlations, and the results are given\nin Table 13. There is, in fact, no concensus on the best way to combine these errors, so\nthe total error should be considered an estimate. The QCD error is taken for Cut 1 for the\nsame reasons as given above. In addition, as we have discussed above, we propagate the\n\"error on the error\" for each of the contributions in order to have some reasonable estimate\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\fof the accuracy of the quoted total theoretical uncertainty. The exception to this is the\nPDF error, which can be considered as an upper limit on the uncertainty, and therefore\ndoes not need an additional accuracy. We conclude that the event generator MC@NLO\ninterfaced to PHOTOS should be sufficient to guarantee an overall theoretical uncertainty\non the W production due to higher order calculation, PDFs, and renormalization scale at\nthe level of 5.5 \u2212 5.9% for the total cross-section of W \u2213 and at approximately 2.5% for the\nacceptance of W \u2213 .\nW production will provide a valuable tool for studying QCD, measuring precision\nelectroweak physics, and monitoring the luminosity. As the luminosity increases, the large\nstatistics will permit a further improvement in the systematic uncertainties due to the\nPDFs. Adding complete O(\u03b1) EWK corrections to the event generator would eliminate\nmost of the EWK uncertainty, and incorporating NNLO QCD corrections would substantially reduce the QCD uncertainties.\nReaching a combined precision of 1%, as desired in the later stages of analysis at high\nintegrated luminosity, will require new tools. In addition to improved PDFs, an event generator combining NNLO QCD with complete O(\u03b1) EWK corrections will be needed, with\nexponentiation in appropriate regimes, and adequate convergence properties to technically\nreach the required precision.[27] Measurement strategies have been proposed that may mitigate some of the effects of systematic errors on the precision of the W measurements.[2] A\ncombination of improved calculations and improved meaurements will be needed to permit\nthe desired precision to be reached as the integrated luminosity increases to a point where\nit is needed.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by US DOE grant DE-FG02-91ER40671.
