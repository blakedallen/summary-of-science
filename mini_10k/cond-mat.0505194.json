S. D. Beach, Ling Wang, and Anders W. Sandvik\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0505194v1 [cond-mat.stat-mech] 8 May 2005\n\nDepartment of Physics, Boston University, 590 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA 02215\n(Dated: May 8, 2005)\nWe propose a treatment of the subleading corrections to finite-size scaling that preserves the\nnotion of data collapse. This approach is used to extend and improve the usual Binder cumulant\nanalysis. As a demonstration, we present results for the two- and three-dimensional classical Ising\nmodels and the two-dimensional, double-layer quantum antiferromagnet.\n\nTrue phase transitions occur only in systems with an\ninfinite number of degrees of freedom. Nevertheless, it\nis possible to study critical phenomena by simulating finite systems of increasing size and extrapolating their\nbehaviour to the thermodynamic limit. The standard\nanalysis relies on Fisher's finite-size scaling (FSS) hypothesis [1, 2], which supposes that near a critical point\nevery thermodynamic property of the system scales as a\nuniversal function of the ratio L/\u03be, where L is the linear\nsize of the system and \u03be is the bulk correlation length.\nThe basic ansatz is that any property with critical exponent \u03ba obeys the relation A(T, L) = L\u03ba/\u03bd fA (L/\u03be(t)),\nwhich is valid for large L and small reduced temperature\nt = (T \u2212 Tc )/Tc . Here, Tc is the critical temperature of\nthe transition, and \u03bd is the critical exponent of the correlation length \u03be \u223c |t|\u2212\u03bd . The function fA (x) depends\nonly on the boundary conditions and the system geometry. Equivalently, one can write\nA(T, L)L\u2212\u03ba/\u03bd = gA (tL1/\u03bd ).\n\n(1)\n\nEquation (1) can be formally motivated [3, 4, 5] by\narguing that the diverging correlation length leaves the\nsystem scale invariant [6]. As t \u2192 0, fluctuations of the\ndynamical variables begin to look the same on all length\nscales (much greater than the lattice spacing). Consequently, any change in the system size L can be compensated by a corresponding change in temperature t. The\ntwo otherwise independent quantities become locked together in a single composite variable x = tL1/\u03bd .\nGraphically, this effect is undersood in terms of socalled data collapse [7, 8]. A plot of Eq. (1) in reduced\nvariables traces out the universal function gA (x). Such\na plot can be useful as a data analysis tool. Given some\nset of measurements {(Ti , Li , Ai )}, the critical behaviour\nof the system can be determined by constructing the co\u2212\u03ba/\u03bd\n1/\u03bd\nand\nordinates xi = Li (Ti \u2212 Tc )/Tc and yi = Ai Li\nchoosing the values of \u03bd, \u03ba, and Tc such that the graph\npoints {(xi , yi )} have the least amount of scatter [9].\nThe accuracy of such a fit depends not only on the\nquantity and quality of the data; it also depends sensitively on whether the data are sufficiently deep in the\nscaling limit (L \u2192 \u221e at fixed x). What constitutes\n\"deep enough,\" however, is model dependent and difficult to determine. For high-accuracy studies, it is best\nnot to put complete trust in Eq. (1). Since true scaling is\n\nrealized only asymptotically, data from all but the largest\nsystems can rarely be made to fall onto a single curve.\nWorse, the data can sometimes be shoehorned into collapse with incorrect parameters. For lattice sizes that\nare accessible to computer simulation, there are almost\nalways significant, non-universal corrections to FSS. To\nsimply ignore them can lead to subtle systematic errors,\nunreliable fits, and overly-optimistic error estimates.\nIn this Letter, we show how to incorporate subleading corrections into the minimal-scatter optimization described above. We argue that the correct approach is to\nmake small, size-dependent modifications to the prefactor and argument of gA (x) in Eq. (1):\nA(T, L)L\u2212\u03ba/\u03bd = N (L)gA (tL1/\u03bd \u2212 \u01eb(L)).\n\n(2)\n\nIn other words, the features of A are both renormalized\nand shifted. In the thermodynamic limit, N (L) \u2192 1\nand \u01eb(L) \u2192 0; we determine the precise asymptotic form\nof these functions by renormalization group arguments.\nThe key point is that \u1ef9 = A(T, L)L\u2212\u03ba/\u03bd N (L)\u22121 now\nbehaves as a universal function of x\u0303 = tL1/\u03bd \u2212 \u01eb(L).\nIn the special case where gA (x) is bounded and monotonic, A(T, L)L\u2212\u03ba/\u03bd becomes increasingly step-functionlike as L \u2192 \u221e. Thus, two such curves, plotted versus\ntemperature for different linear sizes L and L\u2032 , will intersect (except in unusual circumstances) at a unique point\nin the vicinity of the critical temperature Tc . Binder's\nspin-distribution cumulants [10] have this useful property (as does, e.g., the spin stiffness [11]). In the Binder\ncumulant case, \u03ba = 0 happens to be known a priori. We\nsolve formally for the point of intersection Ti (L, L\u2032 ) under the assumption of Eq. (2)-like scaling and determine\nits location as a function of L and n = L\u2032 /L. We prove\nthat a sequence of intersection points (n fixed, L \u2192 \u221e)\nconverges to Tc faster than L\u22121/\u03bd . Fitting the n dependence of a data set offers another way of estimating Tc\nand \u03bd.\nCorrections to finite-size scaling-FSS can be put on\na (somewhat) rigourous basis by invoking the renormalization group (RG) [3, 4, 5]. From the RG point of view,\nthe system is characterized by a set of scaling fields {\u03b6i }.\nThe singular part of the free energy behaves according to\nfs (\u03b61 , \u03b62 , \u03b63 , . . .) = L\u2212d F (\u03b61 Ly1 , \u03b62 Ly2 , \u03b63 Ly3 , . . .), (3)\n\n\f2\nwhere F (x1 , x2 , x3 , . . .) is a regular function of its arguments. The yi are eigenvalues of the RG transformation\nand characterize the flow of the fields under the rescaling\nL 7\u2192 L/b with b > 1; i.e., \u03b6i 7\u2192 \u03b6i byi .\nFor concreteness, suppose that there is only one relevant scaling field \u03b61 = t with a scaling exponent y1 =\n1/\u03bd > 0. Then fs admits a series expansion in the remaining fields (with \u03b6i = \u03b6i,0 fixed):\nfs = L\u2212d\n\n\u221e X\n\u221e\nn\nY\n\u03b6i,0\nL\u2212n|yi | \u2202 n\n1/\u03bd\n, x2 , x3 , . . .)\nn F (tL\nn!\n\u2202x\ni\ni=2 n=0\n\n.\nxi =0\n\n(4)\nIt follows that any thermodynamic quantity generated\nfrom Eq. (4) will have the form\nA(T, L) = L\u03ba/\u03bd gA (tL1/\u03bd ) + L(\u03ba\u2212\u03c6)/\u03bd pA (tL1/\u03bd ) + * * * (5)\nwhere \u03c6/\u03bd = min(|yi |). The functions gA (x) and pA (x)\nare partial derivatives of F . Their asymptotic behaviour,\ngA (x) \u223c |x|\u2212\u03ba and pA (x) \u223c |x|\u2212\u03ba+\u03c6 as x \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, leads\nto the thermodynamic limit\n\u0001\nA(T ) = lim A(T, L) \u223c |t|\u03ba 1 + (const)|t|\u03c6 + * * * . (6)\nL\u2192\u221e\n\nThe functions gA (x) and pA (x) are well-behaved and\nadmit series expansions gA (x) = g0 + g1 x + 21 g2 x2 + * * * ,\netc. Identifying Eqs. (2) and (5) up to O(x3 ), we find\nthat N (L) = 1 + C1 L\u2212\u03c6/\u03bd and \u01eb(L) = C2 L\u2212\u03c6/\u03bd , where\ng 0 p1 \u2212 g 1 p0\ng 2 p0 \u2212 g 1 p1\nand C2 =\n.\nC1 =\n2\ng2 g0 \u2212 g1\ng2 g0 \u2212 g12\n\n(7)\n\nThis analysis is flawed, however, in that scaling holds\nonly asymptotically. The \"equalities\" in Eqs. (3) and (4)\nare subject to corrections analytic in L\u22121 . This means\nthat, strictly speaking, N (L) = (1 + C1 L\u2212\u03c6/\u03bd + * * * )(1 +\na1 L\u22121 + a2 L\u22122 + * * * ). Over some range of L values, this\ncan be represented by N (L) = 1 + cL\u2212\u03c9 , where \u03c9 has\nsome effective value close to that of the true L \u2192 \u221e\nexponent, min(\u03c6/\u03bd, 1). Thus,\nA(T, L) = L\u03ba/\u03bd 1 + cL\u2212\u03c9 )gA (tL1/\u03bd \u2212 dL\u2212\u03c6/\u03bd )\n\n(8)\n\nis the appropriate generalization of Eq. (1). Most important, this scaling ansatz represents an improvement\nover Eq. (5) in that data collapse can still be engineered\nby plotting AL\u2212\u03ba/\u03bd (1 + cL\u2212\u03c9 )\u22121 versus tL1/\u03bd \u2212 dL\u2212\u03c6/\u03bd ,\nwith the addition of \u03c9, \u03c6, c, and d as fitting parameters.\nIntersection point analysis-In the vicinity of a magnetic phase transition, expectation values of powers of\nthe magnetization obey the scaling relation h|M |p iL =\nL\u2212p\u03b2/\u03bd g|M|p (tL1/\u03bd ) for integer p > 0. At large x, the scaling function g|M|p (x) exhibits power-law behaviour with\nexponents p\u03b2 as x \u2192 \u2212\u221e and p\u03b2\u0303 < p\u03b2 as x \u2192 \u221e, which\nensures that the magnetization has the correct form in\nthe thermodynamic limit: h|M |p i\u221e = (\u2212t)p\u03b2 \u03b8(\u2212t). One\ncan define a family of quotient functions [10]\nQp (T, L) =\n\nhM 2p iL\n= N (L)qp (tL1/\u03bd \u2212 \u01eb(L))\nhM 2 ipL\n\n(9)\n\n-let us call them Binder ratios-constructed in such a\nway that the leading-order L dependence outside the scaling function factors out. The temperature dependence\nappears only in the argument of the function qp (x) =\ngM 2p (x)/[gM 2 (x)]p . The subleading corrections enter as\nshown on the right-hand side of Eq. (9). The two lowest\norder Binder cumulants [Eqs. (11) and (12) of Ref. 10]\ncorrespond to the linear combinations U = 1 \u2212 13 Q2 and\n1\nV = 1 \u2212 21 Q2 + 30\nQ3 .\nIn the thermodynamic limit, the Binder ratios jump\ndiscontinuously between Qp (T < Tc ) = qp (\u2212\u221e) = 1 and\nQp (T > Tc ) = qp (\u221e). The value of qp (\u221e) 6= 1 is simply\na prefactor of the gaussian distribution of thermally randomize spins; the value Qp (Tc ) = qp (0) is a non-trivial,\nuniversal constant. The Binder cumulants are also step\nfunctions, taking the values U = 2/3 and V = 8/15 in the\nordered phase and U = V = 0 in the disordered phase.\nWe now consider the point of intersection Ti (L, L\u2032 ) between two Binder ratio curves for system sizes L 6= L\u2032 . To\nstart, let us assume that Ti (L, nL), for some fixed ratio\nn = L\u2032 /L, converges to Tc as a function of L faster than\nL\u22121/\u03bd .

(8)\nwhose scaling function is bounded and monotonic.\nNumerical results-We have applied these results\nto three numerical test cases: the two- (2D) and\nthree-dimensional (3D) nearest-neighbour Ising models,\nand the double-layer quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet [12]. Monte Carlo data were generated for the Ising\nmodels using the Swendsen-Wang cluster update algorithm [13] and for the quantum antiferromagnet using\nstochastic series expansion [14].\nThe Ising models exhibit classical, \u221a\nthermally-driven\nphase transitions at Tc,2D = 2/ log(1 + 2) \u2248 2.2691853\nand Tc,3D \u2248 4.511.

In the left-hand panel, the solid (green) lines are guides to the eye, connecting data points computed for equal\nsystem sizes; the curves grow steeper with increasing L. The oval inset presents a magnified view in which the individual data\npoints and their error bars (blue) are more clearly visible. The scaling plot in the right-hand panel shows the complete collapse\nof the data onto a single curve. This best fit gives Tc = 4.5114(2), \u03bd = 0.625(1), and q2 (0) = 1.60(1) [or U \u2217 = 1 \u2212 13 q2 (0) =\n0.467(3)]. The two inset panels are purely leading-order scaling plots (c = d = 0) based on (top-left) the best fit values just\nquoted and (bottom-right) the values Tc = 4.500(2), \u03bd = 0.60(1) obtained by fitting Q2 versus tL1/\u03bd .\n\nother hand, exhibits a zero-temperature, quantum phase\ntransition as the interlayer coupling strength \u03b1 is tuned\nthrough its critical value \u03b1c \u2248 2.5218 [11, 12]. For each\nof these cases, we computed the second Binder ratio over\na fine, uniform mesh of temperature (coupling) values in\na fixed interval containing Tc (\u03b1c ). (In practice, when\nrough estimates of Tc and \u03bd are available in advance,\nit makes more sense to take measurements in the range\n|x| = |t|L1/\u03bd . 1.) The simulations were performed for a\nrange of relatively small lattice sizes.\nThe data were fit to Eq. (8) (with \u03ba = 0) using the\nthe Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear optimization algorithm [15], which searched the space of parameters Tc\n(\u03b1c ), \u03bd, \u03c9, \u03c6, c, and d to produce the best collapse of\nthe data. Uncertainties in those values were computed\nby bootstrapping [16] the regression over the original\nMonte Carlo data. Comparison with the 2D Ising model,\nwhere the solution is known [17], serves as an important\nproof of concept: the fitted values Tc = 2.26917(2) and\n\u03bd = 0.99(1) with L = 4, 5, . . . , 32 agree within statistical\nuncertainties with the exact results. The same procedure\napplied to the quantum bilayer with L = 8, 10, 12, . . . , 42\nyields \u03b1c = 2.52181(4), the most accurate value to date,\nand \u03bd = 0.715(2), which is consistent with the 3D classical Heisenberg universality class, as expected [18].\nThe raw data for the 3D Ising model are shown in the\nleft-hand panel of Fig. 1. In the right-hand panel, the\n\nsame data are rescaled according to Eq. (8) and collapse\nconvincingly onto a single curve. The two inset panels on\nthe right illustrate the failure of naive FSS: plotted in the\nconventional reduced coordinates (c = d = 0), the data\nare clearly distinguishable as a series of separate curves\ncorresponding to different lattice sizes.\nThe fitted value of the critical temperature Tc =\n4.5114(2) is consistent with the Rosengren conjecture [19]\nand with other reliable estimates; cf. Ref. 20 and Table\n19 in Ref. 21. Note that our result is nearly as accurate\nas those of Pawley et al. and Garcia et al. (viz., Tc =\n4.5115(1) in Ref. 22 and Tc = 4.51152(12) in Ref. 23),\nwhich are based on simulations up to sizes L = 64 and\nL = 115, respectively. And while our value of \u03bd =\n0.625(1) is small with respect to some estimates [21, 22,\n24], it appears to be in very good agreement with more recent Monte Carlo (L = 90, 100, 115) [23] and Monte Carlo\nRenormalization Group (L = 64, 128, 256) [25, 26] calculations. As an additional check, we can read off the value\nq2 (0) = 1.60(1) (the \"y-intercept\" in the right-hand panel\nof Fig. 1), which agrees with the value q2 (0) = 1.604(1)\ncomputed by independent methods [21].\nFigure 2 plots the Binder ratio intersection points of\nthe 2D Ising model and the quantum bilayer for several\nsystem size ratios n = L\u2032 /L. In each case, the complete set of crossing points was computed by interpolating smooth curves between the measured Q2 values (as\n\n\f4\ning limit has an interesting implication: it may be more\nprofitable to collect a large quantity of easily-obtainable\nintermediate-L data [27] (so as to maximize the fit statistics) than to make a herculean effort to obtain data for\nthe very largest possible lattice sizes.\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) Binder ratio crossing points Ti (L, L\u2032 )\nplotted with respect to L (< L\u2032 ) for the (left) 2D Ising model\nand (right) double-layer quantum antiferromagnet. The solid\nlines depict the analytic result given in Eq. (12) for lines of\nconstant n = L\u2032 /L. From top (red) to bottom (blue), the\nratios shown are (left) n = 8/7, n = 3/2, 2, . . . , 11/2, 6 (by\nincrements of 1/2) and (right) n = 3/2, 2, . . . , 9/2, 5.\n\nin the left panel of Fig. 1, where the grid lines form a\nset of intersection points). The data were successfully fit\nto the scaling form given by Eqs. (11) and (12). The\nresulting estimates Tc = 2.2692(8), \u03bd = 0.99(2) and\n\u03b1c = 2.5218(2), \u03bd = 0.715(8) are somewhat less accurate than but consistent with the values determined by\nthe data collapse analysis.\nConclusions-Finite-size scaling describes how critical\nbehaviour emerges from finite systems in the limit of increasingly large system size. As L \u2192 \u221e, quantities in the\ncritical region become universal modulo a size-dependent\nrescaling of the variables, a property which, in principle,\ncan be exploited to measure unknown critical parameters\nby means of data collapse. In practice, such an analysis\nis likely to give misleading results. Still, we have shown\nthat data collapse can be made a viable, high-accuracy\nanalysis tool, so long as subleading corrections to finitesize scaling are properly taken into account. We have\nintroduced a new way of expressing those corrections,\nin which two kinds of deformation-the renormalization\ngA \u2192 N gA and the shift gA (x) \u2192 gA (x \u2212 \u01eb)-serve as\nthe fundamental deviations from leading-order FSS. The\ngreater expressiveness of the scaling form typically leads\nto larger but more meaningful and reliable statistical errors on the critical parameters.\nLarge simulations devour computing resources. With\nMonte Carlo, CPU time scales as Ld+z , where z is a\ncharacteristic dynamical exponent. For the Ising model\nin d = 3, Swendsen-Wang updates [13] give z \u2248 0.75.\nThis implies that it takes as much time to compute the\nsingle system size L = 16 as it does to compute all of\nL = 4, 5, . . . , 12. (Even worse, for models where specialized update schemes are not available, z \u2248 2.) The success of Eq. (8) as a fitting form well away from the scal-\n\n[1] M. E.
