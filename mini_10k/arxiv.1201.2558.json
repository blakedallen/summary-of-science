Previous studies have shown that the power spectra can be approximated as two power-laws,\na shallow one at large scale (larger than 500 pc) and a steeper one at small scale, with the break between the two corresponding to the\nline-of-sight thickness of the galaxy disk. The break separates the 3D behaviour of the interstellar medium at small scale, controlled\nby star formation and feedback, from the 2D behaviour at large scale, driven by density waves in the disk. The break between these\ntwo regimes depends on the thickness of the plane which is determined by the natural self-gravitating scale of the interstellar medium.\nWe present a thorough analysis of the power spectra of the dust and gas emission at several wavelengths in the nearby galaxy M33.\nIn particular, we use the recently obtained images at five wavelengths by PACS and SPIRE onboard Herschel. The large dynamical\nrange (2-3 dex in scale) of most images allows us to determine clearly the change in slopes from -1.5 to -4, with some variations with\nwavelength. The break scale is increasing with wavelength, from 100 pc at 24 and 100\u03bcm to 350 pc at 500\u03bcm, suggesting that the\ncool dust lies in a thicker disk than the warm dust, may be due to star formation more confined to the plane. The slope at small scale\ntends to be steeper at longer wavelength, meaning that the warmer dust is more concentrated in clumps. Numerical simulations of an\nisolated late-type galaxy, rich in gas and with no bulge, like M33, are carried out, in order to better interpret these observed results.\nVarying the star formation and feedback parameters, it is possible to obtain a range of power-spectra, with two power-law slopes and\nbreaks, which nicely bracket the data. The small-scale power-law is indeed reflecting the 3D behaviour of the gas layer, steepening\nstrongly while the feedback smoothes the structures, by increasing the gas turbulence. M33 appears to correspond to a fiducial model\nwith an SFR of \u223c 0.7 M\u2299 /yr, with 10% supernovae energy coupled to the gas kinematics.\nKey words. galaxies: individual: M33 \u2013 galaxies: spiral \u2013 galaxies: infrared \u2013 galaxies: star formation\n\n1. Introduction\nQuantifying the multi-scale structure of the interstellar medium\n(ISM) in galaxies is a difficult enterprise, but rewarding since it\nbetrays the underlying physical phenomena, controlling its dynamics. It has been known for a long time that the ISM reveals\nno preferential scale and is well represented by a fractal strucSend offprint requests to: F.

To study the atomic ISM,\nCrovisier & Dickey (1983) and Green (1993) studied the powerspectrum as a function of inverse scale of the 21cm emission,\nand found a power-law of slope between -2 and -3, independent of the distance and the velocity of the HI. This powerlaw slope was observed to be steeper from -3 to -4, when the\nbroadest velocities were averaged, thus including the warm gas,\nwith more turbulence (Dickey et al. 2001). Goldman (2000) and\nStanimirovic et al. (2000) extended the ISM studies in the Milky\nWay to the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), where a powerlaw of slope -3.1 to -3.4 was found for the dust and gas, and\n1\n\n\fF. Combes et al.: Dust power-spectrum in M33\n\ninterpreted as 3D turbulence, although the index is shallower\nthan the -3.7 Kolmogorov spectrum (Stanimirovic & Lazarian\n2001). A break in scale has been searched for in order to identify the energy injection mechanism, but none has been found at\nsmall scale (i.e. smaller than 500 pc). Instead a flattening towards\nlarger scales has been measured by Elmegreen et al. (2001) in\nthe atomic gas of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). They interpret this flattening as a change of dimensionality, from 3D\nat small scale to 2D at large scale, where the dynamics of the\ngalaxy plane is dominating, and identify the scale of the break\nas the thickness of the plane. This method to find the scale height\nof disks has been developed by Padoan et al. (2001), who found\n\u223c 180 pc in the LMC. Recently, Block et al. (2010) have analysed the dust maps of the LMC from Spitzer, and also confirm\nthis break scale at 100-200 pc. From high resolution numerical\nsimulations fitted to a late-type galaxy like the LMC, Bournaud\net al. (2010) were able to retrieve the characteristics of the observed dust power-spectrum. The source of turbulence could\nthen be due to large-scale differential rotation, cold gas accretion\nor galaxy interactions (Lazarian et al. 2001, Elmegreen & Scalo\n2004). Khalil et al. (2006), from a 2D wavelet analysis of HI in\nour own Galaxy, find a power-law slope of -3 everywhere over\nthe second quadrant, and do not detect the variations with velocity slices predicted by Lazarian & Pogosyan (2004). However\nthey discover an anisotropy linked to spiral arms. The fractal\napproach was widely developed for molecular clouds, which\nare more self-gravitating than the HI gas (Falgarone et al. 1991,\nPfenniger & Combes 1994, Stutzki et al. 1998).\nUp to now, the break scale in the HI distribution has not been\nidentified unambiguously in external galaxies other than the\nLMC, although it has been searched for. Dutta et al. (2008) studied the face-on galaxy NGC 628, and found an HI power spectrum with a single power-law slope of -1.6, over the scales 0.8 to\n8 kpc, their spatial resolution being insufficient to reach the scale\nheight of the gaseous plane. In DDO210, Begum et al. (2006)\nfound a power-law slope of -2.75 over the scales 80 to 500 pc.\nThis steep slope is compatible with what is found in the MW and\nLMC/SMC at small scales, driven by 3D-turbulence. In other\ndwarfs also (Dutta et al. 2009b) a single slope is found. The faceon galaxy NGC1058 is the first one for which the transition from\n3D to 2D turbulence has been claimed (Dutta et al. 2009a): the\nslope changes from -2.5 over 0.6 to 1.5 kpc, to -1 over 1.5-10 kpc\nscales. The scale height is then estimated at 490 pc, which is a\nrelatively large value for the HI layer. In the SMC, while a steep\npower-law is found consistently by several studies, no break\nscale has been found, and no transition to the 2D-turbulence\n(Roychowdhury et al. 2010). It is suggested that dwarf galaxies\nhave gas disks considerably thicker than normal spiral galaxies,\nwhich support previous studies from the thickness of dust lanes\nin edge-on galaxies (e.g. Dalcanton et al. 2004). The transition\nbetween thick and thin gas disks was found at a mass corresponding to a circular velocity of 120 km s\u22121 . For galaxies with\nlow inclination on the sky plane, the thickness of gas disks can be\nestimated through the ratio of gas velocity dispersion to rotation\n(Dalcanton & Stilp 2010). The case of M33 is exactly intermediate, having a rotational velocity of 120 km s\u22121 . Both thick and\nthin disks could be expected.\nAnother tool to explore the scale height of disks with higher\nspatial resolution, apart from studying edge-on galaxies (e.g.\nBianchi & Xilouris 2011), is to study young components related to the gas, as young stars just formed out of the ISM.\nElmegreen et al. (2003a) studied the power-spectrum of star formation maps in nearby galaxies, and found the same behaviour\nas for the LMC in HI: a steep power-law at small scales, typical\n2\n\nof 3D-turbulence, with a flattening at large scales, and a break\ncorresponding to several hundred parsecs, typical of the plane\nthickness. This is true for flocculent and density-wave galaxies, although the spiral arm wave dominates at very large scales.\nIn M33, Elmegreen et al. (2003b) analysed optical and H\u03b1 images and found a very shallow power-law of slope -0.7, which\nthey attribute to flattening due to contamination by strong point\nsources (foreground stars). For the face-on galaxy NGC 628, a\nshallow slope of -1.5 is found, with no break in spite of the very\nhigh spatial resolution obtained with HST (scale below 10 pc,\nElmegreen et al. 2006). Odekon (2008) however finds a transition scale of about 300 pc between a steep spectrum at small\nscale and flattening at large scale, in the stellar distribution of\nM33. This scale does not change much with the age of the stellar population considered, however the slope is steeper for the\nbluest and youngest stars. Sanchez et al. (2010) investigate all\nthe young components in M33, including young stars, HII regions and molecular clouds, and also find a clear transition region, but in the range 0.5-1 kpc. The fact that different results are\nobtained for the same galaxies calls for new studies to clarify the\nsituation.\nThe galaxy M33 has been observed with Herschel PACS\nand SPIRE at all wavelengths, by the Key Project HERM33ES,\nand the photometric maps have been presented in Kramer\net al. (2010), Boquien et al. (2010) and Verley et al. (2010). These\nprovide high signal-to-noise maps with a large dynamical range\nof scales of the dust emission at many wavelength, allowing to\nprobe warm and cool dust. The large and small scale structures\nof the gas and dust are studied through Fourier analysis. We\npresent in Section 2 the different maps used, and how they are\nprocessed, and deprojected to a face-on orientation. The results\nwill be compared to numerical models, which technique is described in Section 3. Results are presented for both observations\nand models in Section 4, and discussed in Section 5. We adopt a\ndistance of 840 kpc for M33 (Freedman et al. 1991).\n\nFig. 1.

(2010,\n2011). The SPIRE observations obtained at 250, 350 and\n500\u03bcm are displayed in Kramer et al. (2010) and Verley\net al. (2010).\nWe also use ground-based H\u03b1 observations presented in\nHoopes et al. (2001) in order to trace the current (\u223c 10 Myr)\nstar formation and GALEX data (Thilker et al. 2005, Gil de Paz\net al. 2007) to trace the recent (\u223c 100 Myr) star formation. To\ntrace the atomic gas, we use the HI 12\u2032\u2032 resolution map published in Gratier et al. (2010), and for the molecular gas, their\npartial CO(2-1) 12\u2032\u2032 resolution map (Gratier et al. 2010).\nAll useful characteristics of the images are summarized in\nTable 1. All maps have been deprojected, with the adopted inclination of 56\u25e6 and position angle of 22.5\u25e6, before Fourier analysis.\nThe data analysed in the present work are more appropriate\nthan earlier data (Elmegreen et al. 2003b, Odekon 2008, Sanchez\net al. 2010) to study the power spectra and the structure of the interstellar medium, since they refer directly to the gas and dust in\nM33, and they have the dynamical range (from 40 pc to 20 kpc)\nand spatial resolution to reveal the thickness of the gas layer.

Numerical model\nIn order to compare with what is expected from the dynamical\ninstabilities of the interstellar medium, we have run idealised\nsimulations, fitted for a late-type galaxy without bulge and rich\nin gas like M33.\n3.1. Technique\n\nThe numerical code is based on the TREE/SPH version developed by Semelin & Combes (2005) and di Matteo et al. (2007),\nwith star formation and feedback. The TREE gravitational part\nof the code deals with two collisionless components: the stars\nand the dark matter, which differ only by their initial conditions.\nIt deals also with the gas component, whose hydrodynamics is\n3\n\n\fF. Combes et al.: Dust power-spectrum in M33\n\nfeedback is not well known, and depends on the coupling of the\nsupernovae and the gas (whether the young stars have already\nleft their birth clouds when they explode, etc..). Some energy\nand supernova explosions are also due to the old population of\nstars (e.g. Dopita 1985).\n3.2. Initial conditions\n\nFig. 5. Same as Figure 3, for the power spectrum of the SPIRE350\u03bcm and 500\u03bcm cool dust map.\ntreated with the SPH (Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics) algorithm, using adaptive resolution. The softening parameter, or the\nspatial resolution of gravity, is taken to be 30 pc, and the average\nsize of a gaseous particle (the SPH kernel, or spatial resolution\nof the hydrodynamics) is also around 30 pc, although it can drop\ndown to 3 pc in overdense regions. The number of particles is\n1.2 million, with 0.6 million gas particles, 0.4 million dark matter particles, and 0.2 million \"stars\" at the beginning of the simulations. The gas particles are assumed to follow an isothermal\nequation of state, with pressure forces corresponding to a sound\nvelocity of 6 km s\u22121 , in the fiducial model. Shocks are treated\nwith a conventional form of artificial viscosity, with parameters\ngiven in di Matteo et al. (2007). All physical quantities (density\nand forces) are computed averaging over a number of 50 neighbours. The equations of motion are integrated using a leapfrog\nalgorithm with a fixed time step of 0.3 Myr.\nStar Formation is taken into account in most models, with\nan assumed Schmidt law, of exponent n=1.5, i.e. for each gas\nparticle of mass Mgas , and volumic density \u03c1gas computed over\nits neighbours:\ndMgas\n= C\u2217 \u03c11/2\ngas\nMgas dt\nwhere in most runs, the star formation constant C\u2217 is calibrated\nsuch that the gas consumption time-scale is of the order of 2Gyr\n(then C\u2217 = C0 ). C\u2217 is increased in some of the runs, to check\nits influence on the gas scale height. In most simulations, the\ndensity threshold for star formation is set very low, and is then\nincreased in a few runs. Star formation is then taken into account\nfor each gas particle, using the hybrid particles scheme (e.g. di\nMatteo et al. 2007), before sufficient stellar mass is accumulated\nand a star particle can be created. Continuous mass loss is also\nconsidered, with about 40% of the stellar mass loss by young\nmassive stars after 5 Gyr (Jungwiert et al. 2001).\nThe energy reinjected by supernovae into the interstellar\nmedium is assumed to be a kinematic feedback on neighboring\ngas particles: each neighbour of a SPH particle having formed\n\u03b4m of stars is given a radial kick in velocity away from the supernova formed. The energy available is computed from \u03b4m, assuming a Scalo IMF (about 0.5% of the stars formed have a mass\nlarger than 8 M\u2299 and explode as supernovae), the energy of a\nsupernova ES N = 1051 erg is distributed to the 50 neighbours\naccording to their weight (the SPH kernel), with an efficiency \u01eb,\nwhich has been varied from 10\u22124 to 1, with 10% being the fiducial value (see Table 2). For the fiducial feedback efficiency, a\nparticle might get a kick of \u223c 1 km s\u22121 at each time-step, for the\nextreme feedback, it can reach 5 km s\u22121 . The efficiency of the\n4\n\nThe initial stellar component of the galaxy is selected to be of\ntype Scd, similar to the M33 galaxy.\nThe stellar and gaseous disks are represented initially by\nMiyamoto-Nagai functions, with characteristic height parameters of 170 pc and 70 pc respectively. The stellar disk has a mass\nof 0.5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 , with a characteristic radius of 2 kpc, while the\ngas disk has a mass of 1.5 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 , with a radius 2.5 kpc. Both\nare embedded in a spherical halo of dark matter, represented by\na Plummer sphere of mass 4 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 within 18 kpc, with a\ncharacteristic radius of 9.5 kpc.\nThe initial stability of the gas and stellar disks is controlled\nby the Toomre parameter Q, ratio of the radial component of\nthe velocity dispersion to the critical one \u03c3crit = 3.36G\u03a3/\u03ba, \u03a3\nbeing the disk surface density of the component (gas or stars),\nand \u03ba the epicyclic frequency. We select equal Toomre parameters for gaseous and stellar disks. The azimuthal velocity dispersions verify initially the epicyclic ratio \u03c3\u03b8 /\u03c3r = \u03ba/2\u03a9, and\nthe z-components are fixed by the isothermal equilibrium of the\ndisks, in the vertical direction.\nThe gas is isothermal, but its equivalent velocity dispersion,\ngoverning the pressure, may be varied between 6 and 12 km s\u22121 .\nThe recipes for star formation: efficiency, density threshold, and\nfeedback, are also varied; they have a significant impact on the\ninterstellar gas structure.\nThe initial conditions of the runs described here are given\nin Table 2. The rotation curve corresponding to one of the runs\nis plotted in comparison to the data points in Figure 1. All runs\nhave similar rotation curves.

Results\n4.1. Power-spectrum of the data\n\nThe power spectra of the 2D projected maps were analysed\nthrough the 2D Fourier transform:\nZ Z\n\u2217\nF(x, y)e\u2212i(kx x+ky y) dxdy\nF (k x , ky ) =\nx\n\ny\n\n\fF. Combes et al.: Dust power-spectrum in M33\n\nwhere F(x, y) is the intensity of each pixel, and k x and ky are\nthe wave number, conjugate to x and y, varying as the inverse of\nscales. The full 2D power spectrum is given by\nP(k x , ky ) = (Re[F \u2217 ])2 + (Im[F \u2217 ])2\nAn example of 2D-power spectrum is given for the PACS100\u03bcm image, in Figure 2. The one-dimensional powerspectrum P(k) can be calculated through azimuthal averaging,\nin the (k x ,ky ) plane, using k2 = k2x + ky2 . The power spectra P(k)\nare plotted for the various maps in Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.\nTwo slopes have been fitted at small (ss) and large scales (LS),\nand the different values can be found in Table 3, together with\nthe break scale separating the two regimes. In most of the cases,\nthe power spectra show clearly two different regimes, with different slopes, and small and large-scales, for scales larger than the\nspatial resolution. A knee is apparent between the two regimes\n(ss and LS), and indicates the break scale. We have used a leastsquare-fit program to determine the slopes of the two powerlaws, and left open the position of the separation between the\ntwo straight lines. Varying the value of the separation, we select\nfor the break the value which minimises the sum of the \u03c72 of the\ntwo line fits (ss and LS). In general the minimum is quite clear.\nThere is one ambiguous case, however, which is the HI map,\nin Figure 8. The two slopes are close, and the determination less\ntrustworthy. Examples of the deprojected images of the Herschel\ndust emission are displayed in Figures 9 and 10. In addition to\nthe power spectra, the azimuthal large-scale structure develops\nspiral arms, that are quantified and studied in the Appendix A.\nThe determination of the break scale is obviously more secure\nwhen it is found significantly larger than the resolution scale\nof the observations. We have tested the effect of spatial resolution by smoothing the PACS-100\u03bcm map in Appendix B. In\nthe observed power spectra (e.g. Figures 3-7), the limit of the instrumental resolution is clearly seen, through the sudden change\nfrom a straight line to a dropping curve, at large k. We have indicated with two vertical dashed lines, the value of the resolution\nscale on the major axis, and also the geometric mean of the resolution on both minor and major axis, since the de-projection to a\nface-on galaxy implies a factor 1/cos(56\u25e6) = 1.79 larger beam on\nthe minor axis. We conclude from Appendix B that break scales\nat least twice larger than the beam scale are robust with respect\nto resolution effect.\nWe have also tested the robustness of our determinations by\ncomputing the power spectra using only one side of the galaxy.\nThe easiest way to compute that, with the same algorithm, was\nto remove in the map one half of the galaxy, say the southern\npart, and complete the map by extending the northern part by\npoint symmetry through the center. For all maps, the different\nslopes and break scales for the two sides of the galaxy are also\ndisplayed in Table 3: the last columns display the extreme values\nfound for the slopes and breaks. This procedure maximizes the\nerror bars, especially in the LS-slopes, since the Norhern part\nof M33 is quite different from the Southern part. The slopes are\ndetermined with an error bar of the order of \u00b10.2 in general, and\nthe break scales are even more robust, within 15%. We have also\nchecked the effect of smoothing on the maps. As expected, the\npower-spectrum at large-scale is unchanged, and only the power\nat the extreme of the small-scales of the spatial resolution drops.\nThe break scale also is enlarged by the resolution, when it is\ntoo close, and we can see for instance that the break at 70\u03bcm is\nlarger than at 24 and 100\u03bcm (Table 3) only because of the coarser\nresolution. The fact that some maps have a pixel size smaller\nthan the Nyquist size (half of the nominal resolution) does not\n\ninfluence the results. We have truncated the power spectra at the\nNyquist sampling, in the figures.\nLooking at Tables 1 and 3, it is ovious that the break scale\nis affected by the spatial resolution of the maps. Five maps have\na ratio between break and resolution scales lower or equal to\n3 (NUV, the 3 SPIRE, and CO), for the others, the ratio is 3.8\n(FUV), 12.5 (H\u03b1), 4.2 (MIPS-24\u03bcm), 3.9 (MIPS-70\u03bcm), 3.9\n(PACS-100\u03bcm), 3.6 (PACS-160\u03bcm) and 3.3 (HI). For those, the\ndetermination of the break appears significant. As for the slope\ndetermination, the large-scale ones are not affected, and their\nvariation is meaningful: the LS-slopes are flatter for the starformation tracers than for the dust and gas, and they are growing\nsteeper with wavelength.\n\nFig. 6. Same as Figure 3, for the power spectrum of the H\u03b1 and\nMIPS-24\u03bcm maps.\n\nFig. 7. Same as Figure 3, for the power spectrum of the GALEX\nNUV and FUV maps.\nIt is interesting to note that the H\u03b1 map, tracing gas ionized\nby the UV photons from massive stars and, indirectly, current\nstar formation, has power spectrum slopes significantly flatter\nthan the other power spectra of the ISM components. This might\nbe expected, since star formation gives more power to the small\nscales. Its break scale, related to the plane thickness is higher.\nThe GALEX FUV and NUV, tracing the recent, but past, star\nformation, have slopes more comparable to the other ISM slopes\nhowever, and have smaller break scales, implying thinner layers.\nThe break scale in H\u03b1 is larger than in the UV because H\u03b1 traces\nthe ionised gas, and only indirectly the young stars. The ionised\nlayer may be thicker, affected by bubbles, filaments, fountain\neffects associated to star formation.\n5\n\n\fF.

Their different break scales reflect the increasing beam size with wavelength. As for the gas, the molecular medium appears thinner than the atomic one, although spatial\nresolution might influence its break scale.\nIndependent of the spatial resolutions, the slope of the\npower-spectra at small scale are steeper at large wavelengths for\nthe dust emission. Between 250 and 500\u03bcm, the SPIRE maps\nhave slopes between -4.3 and -4.7, while the MIPS and PACS\nmaps between 24 and 100\u03bcm have slopes comprised within -2.7\nand -3.8. This is significant, and tends to show that the cool dust\n6\n\nThe various runs develop different gas structure and clumpiness,\nas can be seen in Figures 11 to 16, due to both initial conditions\nthat are selected more or less stable, or with different sub-grid\n\"temperature\" of the gas, and to the star formation rate and feedback. Some galaxies, which are launched with initial conditions\namong the most stable, can end up with a more perturbed morphology and larger turbulence than others started more unstable,\ndue to a larger supernovae feedback.\nWe computed the Fourier analysis in the same way on the\ngas maps obtained in the numerical simulations. The derived results are converging towards the same values at the middle of the\nruns, and we plot all of them for the final snapshots at T= 667\nMyr for the sake of simplicity (cf Figures 17, 18 and 19). For\ncomparison, we also plot the power-spectrum of some old stellar components, which have almost only one power-law (Figure\n20). These correspond to run 2 and run 7 at T= 667 Myr. There\nis structure until about 300 pc, and no small-scale component, as\nexpected for a collisionless component.\nThe first result which is obvious in Table 4 is that the predictions of the models bracket the values obtained in the observations, both in the slopes at large and small scales, and in the break\nscales. Those can be compared to the actual thickness of the gas\nlayer, in the simulations. This is done in Table 4, showing that\nthe break scale does not follow closely the thickness. Although\nboth should be of the same order when only the self-gravity of\nthe gas is taken into account, their close relation is blurred by\nother factors, and in particular the feedback efficiency. When the\nfeedback is too extreme, the small scale structure of the gas is\nsmoothed out, even towards larger scale than the vertical thickness. So the range of break scales is wider than that of possible\nplane heights.\nThe main parameters that control the turbulence and therefore the power-spectrum of the gas structure are the star formation rate, the amount of feedback, but also the assumed equivalent temperature of the gas, or sound speed, directly involved\nin the pressure forces. Increasing the turbulence by supernovae\nfeedback suppresses efficiently the small-scale structure (powerlaw slopes of \u223c -5.), and thickens substantially the gas layer, and\nthe corresponding break scale. Without star formation and feedback, it is only possible to have gas morphologies comparable to\nthe observed ones if a minimum sound speed of 12 km s\u22121 is injected. Figures 11 to 16 show the large variety of gas structures,\naccording to the variations of those parameters. It appears that\nour fiducial model (run4) is the one which corresponds the best\nto the M33 galaxy, both for its morphology, and for the typical\npower-law slopes and break scale. It has a star formation rate of\n\u223c 0.7 M\u2299 /yr, and a feedback such that 10% of supernovae energy\nis coupled to the kinematics of the gas. Verley et al. (2009) found\nfor M33 a star formation rate of 0.5 M\u2299 /yr.\n\n5. Discussion and conclusions\nWe have presented the Fourier analysis of dust and gas emission\nmaps of M33 at several wavelengths, and compared them with\nthe H\u03b1 and UV maps, tracers of recent star formation. We find\nthat all the power spectra can be decomposed into two regimes,\na large-scale (> 500 pc) power-law, of \u22121.5 < slopeLS < \u22121.0,\nand a steeper small-scale one, with \u22124.0 < slope ss < \u22123.0.\n\n\fF.

The H\u03b1 break scale is significantly higher (300 pc), implying a thicker layer for ionized\ngas, while the UV layers appears thinner (65 pc). This might\nbe understood considering that UV originates from stars that\nare concentrated in the disk whereas the ionised gas could be\npresent quite far from the plane of the disk: giant HII regions\nhave typically round shapes, and are not as confined to the disk.\nTabatabaei et al. (2007) have already shown with wavelets that\nthe H\u03b1 map is dominated by giant HII regions, which are bubblelike with sizes from 100 to 500 pc. By comparison the diffuse\ncomponent is weaker, which flattens the Fourier ss-slope, and\nenlarges the break scale. Although the warm dust in the MIPS8\n\n24\u03bcm map is also related to the young star formation, there are\nno such large bubbles: only the point sources are prominent inside the bubble, as can be seen in Figure 3 of Verley et al. (2010).\nThis explains the different break scales between H\u03b1 and MIPS24\u03bcm maps.\nIt is also possible that the large thickness suggested by the\nH\u03b1 analysis is related to the diffuse ionized gas (DIG) observed\nin several edge-on galaxies to follow a rather thick layer of about\n1 kpc height (see a review by Dettmar 1992). This extra-planar\nionized gas is thought to be due to star formation, it is present in\nabout 40% of 74 edge-on galaxies (Rossa & Dettmar 2003). It\ncan be widely diffuse, or take the shape of filaments, plumes and\nbubbles (Rand, 1997). These extra-planar extensions could be\ndue to UV ionizing photons escaping the star forming regions,\nsupernovae feedback, fountain effects, chimneys, and be part of\n\n\fF.

The vertical dash line represents the softening length of\nthe gravity.\n\ntermine the thickness of the gas plane, at any orientation on the\nplane of the sky, and the actual physical state of the gas, in its\nstar formation phase. Note however that the current models are\nnot devoid of shortcomings: they only partly allow to distinguish\nbetween the 12 different tracers of the gas phase observed here,\nas radiative transport, dust properties, etc. are not taken into account.\nComparison of power spectrum analysis between galaxies\nshould allow a determination of their relative star formation rate\nand feedback. This will need however high spatial resolution\nmaps, such as the ones that will be provided with ALMA.\nThe gas plane in M33 appears relatively thick and turbulent,\nwith respect to our closest fiducial model, which could be a consequence of its recent heating in particular through the M31 interaction (McConnachie et al. 2009).\nAcknowledgements. We warmly thank the anonymous referee for his/her constructive comments and suggestions. We have made use of the NASA/IPAC\nExtragalactic Database (NED).\n\nan active disk-halo interaction, with exchange of matter (Howk\n& Savage 2000).\nThe comparison with simulated models tells us that the observation of a break in the power-spectrum of observed gas distribution is not always related to the 2D/3D transition, and indicates the thickness of the gaseous disk only when the latter is not\nheated by a strong star formation rate and a strong supernovae\nfeedback. For a quiescent galaxy, the break should still be an\nindication of the gas layer thickness.\nBlock et al. (2010) found in the LMC that the small scale\nslopes of the power spectra were steeper at longer wavelengths,\ni.e. the cool dust was smoother than the hot emission. We find\na similar result. The slope of the SPIRE maps are around -4.5,\nwhile the warmer dust at 24-100\u03bcm has an average slope of -3.2.\nThis observation can be interpreted in terms of star formation\noccuring in the clumpy medium. Once the stars are formed, they\nheat the dust around, and this explains why the emission at shortest wavelength (warmer dust) is more clumpy. Also the break\nscale, and thus the thickness of the plane, is larger for the cold\ngas. This could be due in addition to the fact that the cold component is much more extended in radius (Kramer et al. 2010),\nand it is well known that the gas layer is flaring in the outer parts\nof galaxies. As for the gas emission, the molecular gas appears\nmore clumpy, but only slightly more so than the atomic gas. And\nthe break occurs at about the same scale. Since it is likely that\nin the relatively quiescent M33 galaxy, the break indicates the\nthickness of the gas layer, this situation is not alike the Milky\nWay, where the CO component is significantly thinner than the\nHI (Bronfman et al. 1988). A thick CO layer, 3 times as wide as\nthe dense molecular gas layer, and comparable to the HI layer,\nhas been observed (Dame & Thaddeus 1994), but it involves a\nsmall mass. M33 being a galaxy of intermediate mass, could\nhave indeed a thicker gas layer than the Milky Way (Dalcanton\net al. 2004).\nWe also showed that numerical models predict gas morphologies and small scale power-laws which bracket the observational data. It is possible to obtain a colder or a more turbulent\ninterstellar medium, by varying the star formation feedback and\nthe sound speed of the gas. The Fourier analysis of the models reveals that the break scale is a good indicator of the actual\nthickness of the gas layer, although it varies within a wider range\nwhen extreme feedback is used, and smoothes out the small scale\ngas structures. The power-law slopes obtained in the models at\nlarge and small scale reflect quite accurately the gas morphology\nand turbulence. Fourier analyses are therefore a good tool to de-\n\nReferences\nBegum, A., Chengalur, J. N., Bhardwaj, S.: 2006, MNRAS 372, L33\nBianchi S., Xilouris E. M.: 2011, A&A 531, L11\nBlock D.

The different tracers also reveal a contrasted spiral structure, that is interesting to present, at least in\ntwo representative deprojected maps, the Herschel 100\u03bcm image\n(dust and gas images show similar features), and the H\u03b1 image\n(star formation, similar to UV images).\nWe have computed the Fourier transform of the corresponding surface densities, decomposed as:\nX\n\u03bc(r, \u03c6) = \u03bc0 (r) +\nam (r) cos(m\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6m (r))\n\nFig. B.1. Power spectrum of the PACS 100\u03bcm map, at degraded\nresolutions of 11 and 18\u2032\u2032 . The vertical dash line at right represents the smoothed spatial resolution, on the major axis. Since\nthe de-projection to a face-on galaxy implies a factor 1/cos(56\u25e6)\n= 1.79 larger beam on the minor axis, we have also plotted a second dashed vertical line at left, indicating the geometric mean of\nthe resolution on both minor and major axis.\n\nm\n\nwhere the normalised strength of the Fourier component m\nis Am (r) = am (r)/\u03bc0 (r). Thus, A2 represents the normalized amplitude for a m = 2 distortion like a bar or spiral arm, at a given\nradius, and A1 represents the same for the disk lopsidedness. The\nquantity \u03c6m denotes the position angle or the phase of the Fourier\ncomponent m. Such a density analysis has been made for example by Bournaud et al. (2005), to study asymmetries and lopsidedness in galaxies, and correlate it with m = 2 features.\nFigure A.1 shows a plot of the amplitude Am (r) and the phase\n\u03c6m (r) versus radius r for M33, at 100\u03bcm and Figure A.2, the\nsame for H\u03b1. Both show a prominent spiral feature at radii \u223c 3-4\nkpc, with a phase decreasing slightly with radius, in the direct\nsense. The m = 2 distortions show accompanying m = 4 harmonics. The lopsidedness also increases with radius, while the\nthe corresponding phase is fairly constant.\nThese plots show that the spiral structure in M33 is mildly\ncontrasted, in both gas and SFR tracers. Indeed, the normalised\nm = 2 amplitude is between 0.4 and 0.8. There is also a significant asymmetry and lopsidedness, as testified by the strong\nm = 1 amplitude comparable with the m = 2. This explains why\nthe slopes at large-scale were more different between the two\nhalves of the galaxy than the small-scale ones. This large asymmetry could be due to the current interaction between M33 and\nM31 (McConnachie et al. 2009).\n\nAppendix B: The effect of resolution\nWe have explored the effect of spatial resolution in the determination of the various slopes and break scales, in smoothing\nthe PACS-100\u03bcm map at various resolutions, from the original\n7\u2032\u2032 to 11, 18, 26 and 36\u2032\u2032 , corresponding to 44, 72, 104 and 144\npc on the major axis. The resulting fits are shown in Figure B.1\nand B.2, to be compared with Figure 3. The break scales are respectively 97, 111, 135, 195 pc, instead of 93 pc for the original\n7\u2032\u2032 resolution.
