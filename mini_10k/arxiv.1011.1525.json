In many occasions, their time evolution is modeled by a system of\ncoupled differential equations, or by a high dimensional discrete time dynamical system.\nThose models take into account a proper individual dynamics for each unit and a coupling\nbetween units which may depend on the state of the whole system. Typical example of\nsuch models are coupled oscillators (continuous time) and coupled map lattices (discrete\ntime) [10]. They usually assume well mathematically characterized individual dynamics,\nthe main question under study being how the coupling of units can generate the collective\nbehaviors observed in physical and biological systems. Nevertheless, from a mathematical\npoint of view, these systems are a source of open problems and most mathematical results\nhave been proved under the assumption of weak coupling and/or focus on particular\nsolutions [28].\nPulse-coupled oscillators appear frequently in biological sciences, in particular in neuroscience to model neural networks [21]. In this context, the state of each oscillator\n1\n\nInstituto de Matem\u00e1tica, Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica, Montevideo, Uruguay, eleonora@fing.edu.uy\nCentro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Modelamiento de Fen\u00f3menos Aleatorios \u2013 Valpara\u0131\u0301so, Facultad de Ingeniera,\nUniversidad de Valpara\u0131\u0301so, Valpara\u0131\u0301so, Chile, pierre.guiraud@uv.cl\n2\n\n1\n\n\fdescribes the difference of electrical potential between the inside and the outside of a neuron's membrane. An archetype of pulse-coupled neural network appears in literature [19]\nin the following form:\nV\u0307i = fi (Vi ) +\n\nn\nX\nj=1\n\nhji (Vi )\u03b4(t \u2212 tj )\n\n\u2200 i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}.\n\n(1)\n\nThe solutions of the non-coupled equation V\u0307i = fi (Vi ) define the individual dynamics of\nthe membrane potential of the neuron i. The following additional rule is assumed: if\nthe potential Vi reaches the so called threshold potential \u03b8 > 0 at an instant denoted ti ,\nthen the neuron i is said to fire (or to emit a spike) and its potential is reset to zero.\nThe term hji (Vi )\u03b4(t \u2212 tj ) is a short hand notation meaning that at time tj the potential\nof the neuron i suffers a discontinuity jump of amplitude hji (Vi (t\u2212\nj )). This discontinuity\nhji is produced by the firing of the presynaptic neuron j on the potential Vi (t\u2212\nj ) of the\npostsynaptic neuron i. If the jump is negative (hji < 0) the interaction is said inhibitory\nand if it is positive (hji > 0) it is said excitatory.\nWhen weak interactions are assumed, and extra conditions on fi are imposed, it is\npossible to reduce (1), and also more realistic neural models, to a canonical system of\nphase coupled oscillators [17, 18]. This opens the possibility to get some insight in the\ndynamics of a huge class of weakly coupled neural networks by studying for example\nthe existence and the stability of synchronized states [13, 17, 19]. Further insight in\nthe dynamics of neural networks can be obtained by considering specific models. In this\nrespect (leaky) Integrate and Fire (IF) neural networks [15] are certainly the most popular.\nFor these networks fi is a real affine function. Many mathematical works on IF neural\nnetworks deal with the dependence of particular solutions on the parameters describing\nthe interactions (that are not necessarily impulsive). The effect of the velocity of the\ninteractions on the stability of synchronized and anti-synchronized states is detailed for\nweak excitatory and inhibitory interactions in the case of two [26, 11] or more neurons\n[27] and in presence of delay [11], [2]. Synchronized solutions and more generally phaselocked solutions are also studied in the case of strong coupling for different architectures\nof network [2].\nAlthough important results about the phenomenology of IF neural networks have been\nobtained, they principally focus on particular solutions, and there is still few mathematical\nresults about their global dynamics, possibly letting unknown important features of neural\nnetworks. The purpose of this paper is precisely to give a mathematical description,\ndeveloping analytical proofs, of the global dynamics of IF neural networks. In spite of IF\nneural networks being continuous time dynamical systems, as far as we know, previous\nstudies of their global dynamics develop methods of discrete time dynamical systems. In\ntheir seminal work [23] study a Poincar\u00e9 return map to prove that for the system (1)\nwith homogeneous constant excitatory interactions (hji = cte > 0) and homogeneous\nindividual dynamics (fi = f ), almost all orbits become synchronized. In [9] a discrete\ntime IF neural network, which may be seen as a discretization of (1) by a formal Euler\nscheme, is studied. The corresponding dynamical system is defined by the iterations of a\ngeneral piecewise affine map. It is proved that for generic values of the parameters, the\n2\n\n\fglobal asymptotic dynamics is supported on a finite number of stable periodic orbits. It is\nalso proved that for non generic values of the parameters, asymptotic dynamics is sensitive\nto initial conditions.\nMotivated by the rigorous results of [9], which are proved for discrete time system, the\nquestion we address in this paper is if they are also true for continuous time IF neural\nnetworks. Although elaborated integration schemes, especially designed for the simulation\nof neural networks have been developed [3], there is no way to completely eliminate numerical errors. Thus, the results of simulations can drastically depend on the used integration\nstrategy [25]. This motivates the interest of developing rigorous mathematical proofs also\nin the continuous time case. In this respect, the previous works [5, 7, 20] proved that\nperiodic orbits attract almost all initial conditions, but under the assumption that the\ninteractions are all inhibitory, while arbitrary interactions are considered in [9].\nThe main property allowing the proof of these results is that the (return) map is\npiecewise contractive in the whole phase space. In Section 2, we derive the return map of\n(1), assuming fi (Vi ) = \u2212\u03b3Vi +K, the independence of hji on Vi , and other hypothesis ((H1)\nand (H2), stated in the same section) giving a precise meaning to (1). In Section 3, we\ninvestigate the contraction properties of the return map. We prove that, unexpectedly, it\nis not piecewise contractive in the whole phase space for an open region of the interactions\nvalues, if some of them are excitatory (Theorem 2). Nevertheless, we find also an open\nsubset in the space of parameters such that this return map is piecewise contractive in\nthe whole phase space, with respect to an adapted metric (Theorem 3). This parameters\nsubset is defined by hypothesis (H3) and (H4) stated in Section 3.\nWe give now a short version of our results about the global dynamics of IF neural\nnetworks:\nTheorem 1. 1) Under Hypothesis (H1), if the neural network is completely excitatory\nand the number of neurons is sufficiently large, then all the orbits are eventually periodic\nand synchronized.\n2) Under the hypothesis (H1), (H2), (H3) and (H4), if the neural network contains inhibitory neurons, then the stable orbits are attracted by a countable number of limit cycles.\nThe part 1) of this theorem is reformulated in Theorem 4, which is proved in Section\n4. Its proof is done only under hypothesis (H1), but the hypothesis of existence of a large\nnumber of neurons is necessary. In fact, if the neural network is completely excitatory, but\nthe number of neurons is not sufficiently large (in relation with the minimum amplitude of\nthe synaptic interactions), then there exist orbits that are never synchronized (Proposition\n4.2).\nThe part 2) follows from Theorem 5 in Section 5. This last theorem states that the\nstable asymptotic dynamics of the return map is supported by periodic orbits. However,\nit does not prevent the system from exhibiting a weak form of chaos. In particular, stable\nchaos\n[24] exists because of the coexistence of an uncountable set of sensitive states. The\ndistance between the limit cycles (attracting all the stable dynamics) and the sensitive\n3\n\n\fpoints influences the period of the cycles and determines the effects of small perturbations\n(rounding errors, stochastic perturbations). The expected effects are the existence of long\ntransient times and of cycles of large period, provided the sensitive points and the stable\npoints are sufficiently intricate.\nThe proof of Theorem 5 does not use the particular formulation of the return map. It\napplies to a wide class of piecewise contractive maps (see Definition 5.2). Previous results\n[1, 4, 6, 9, 14], stating the existence of periodic attractors for piecewise contractive maps,\nare proved in a different context. In [1] the maps are one dimensional and injective. In\nthe works studying higher dimensional dynamics, only affine maps [9, 4] or injective maps\n[6] are considered. In our case none of these hypothesis is assumed, since the proof applies\nto n-dimensional maps, that are neither necessarily piecewise affine nor globally injective.\n\n2\n\nIntegrate and fire neural network\n\nWe propose to study the global dynamics of leaky integrate and fire neural networks. Our\nworking model is a standard IF neural network considering an arbitrary number of neurons\nconnected by inhibitory and excitatory synapses. This system, which is defined precisely\nin Subsection 2.1, is the model (1) with fi (Vi ) = \u2212\u03b3Vi + K and where hji (Vi ) = Hji is\nindependent of Vi . Its global dynamics is studied in the next sections via a Poincar\u00e9 map\nwhich is derived in Subsection 2.2.\n\n2.1\n\nDefinition of the model\n\nAt each time t \u2208 R, the state of a neuron i \u2208 I := {1, . . . , n} is described by its\nmembrane potential Vi (t) and the state of the network is represented by the vector\nV(t) = (V1 (t), . . . , Vn (t)). According to model (1), the time evolution of the network\nhas two regimes: a sub-threshold regime and a firing regime.\nEquations of the sub-threshold regime: The sub-threshold regime occurs when\nVi (t) < \u03b8 for all i \u2208 I, where \u03b8 > 0 is called the threshold potential. In such a regime, the\nstate of the network satisfies the system of differential equations defined by:\nV\u0307i (t) = \u2212\u03b3Vi (t) + K\n\n\u2200 i \u2208 I.\n\n(2)\n\nThe constant \u03b3 > 0 stands for 1/RC where R and C are respectively the resistance and\nthe capacity of the neural membrane, and K = Iext /C > 0 is proportional to a constant\nexternal current Iext . According to Equation (2), the potential of each neuron tends to\nthe equilibrium value:\nK\n= RIext > 0.\n(3)\n\u03b2 :=\n\u03b3\nEquations of the firing regime: If we assume \u03b2 > \u03b8, and take an initial state V(0)\nsuch that Vi (0) < \u03b8 for all i \u2208 I, then there exists a smallest time t0 (which depends on\nV(0)) when the potential of (at least) one neuron reaches the threshold. At this instant\n4\n\n\fthe network enters in the firing regime: the neuron emits a spike that induces a change\nin the potential of all the neurons it is connected with, and its own potential is reset to\na smaller value than the threshold, chosen equal to 0 (without loss of generality, and as\nconventional for integrate and fire models). Therefore, when the network enters in the\nfiring regime, its state suffers a discontinuity due to the reset of the firing neurons, and to\nthe change of potential of the neurons receiving the spikes of the firing neurons. Formally,\nif J \u2282 I denote the set of all the neurons that reach \u03b8 at time t0 , i.e. spontaneously (by\nthe solution flow of equation (2)) or by an excitation produced by other neurons, the state\nof the network satisfies:\n\nlim Vi (t) = 0 if\nt\u2193t0\n\ni\u2208J\n\nand\n\nlim Vi (t) = lim Vi (t) +\nt\u2193t0\n\nt\u2191t0\n\nX\nj\u2208J\n\nHji\n\nif\n\ni\u2208\n/ J.\n\n(4)\n\nThe constant Hji represents the synaptic interaction triggered by a spike of the neuron j\ntowards the neuron i. It is positive for an excitatory synapse, negative for an inhibitory\nsynapse, and equal to 0 if the neurons are not connected. Due to the instantaneous\ncharacter of the reset and of the synaptic interactions, in presence of excitatory neurons,\nthe dynamics of IF models of type (1) may be ill-defined or exhibit infinite firing rates\nwhen the network has some loops3 , unless some kind of refractory period is considered.\nTo ensure the model is well defined for any network, we suppose that a neuron which fires\nat time t0 , can neither receive nor emit a second spike at time t0 (right side of (4)). In this\nsense we consider a refractory phenomenon, which as well as the reset and the synaptic\ninteractions is instantaneous. It results that the set J of the neurons that fire at time t0\nhas to be defined and computed carefully to take into account the refractory phenomenon.\nIn Section 2.2, we write the exact mathematical definition of this set (formula (10) and\n(11)).\nDefinition 2.1. We will say that a neuron j is excitatory (inhibitory) if all its synapses\nare excitatory (inhibitory), i.e Hji > 0 (Hji 6 0) for all i \u2208 I such that j 6= i. We will say\nthat a neuron is \"mixed\" if it is neither excitatory nor inhibitory, namely, if it does not\nsatisfy Dale's principle (see [17] page 7).\nTo prove Theorem 1 and other results along this paper, we will make the following\nhypothesis:\n(H1) The membrane potential of the neurons has a lower bound, i.e. there exists \u03b1 < 0\nsuch that for all i \u2208 I and t \u2208 R, we have Vi (t) > \u03b1.\n(H2) If a neuron i suffers inhibitory and excitatory interactions at the same time, and\nif the sum of the excitatory interactions is large enough to make it reach the threshold\npotential, then the neuron i fires.\n3\n\nFor example, consider a loop of two neurons where neuron 1 is excitatory, neuron 2 is inhibitory, and\nthe synaptic interactions are sufficiently large to lead to the following situation: the neuron 1 fires instantaneously and induces the instantaneous firing of the neuron 2, but this last firing prevents instantaneously\nneuron 1 from firing. Then, the state of neuron 1 is undetermined.\n\n5\n\n\fThe hypothesis (H1) fits with the physical bounds of the electric potentials of real\nbiological or electronic systems: the potential of a neuron can not be arbitrarily small.\nWe do not specify any particular negative value for \u03b1. It is a parameter of the model\nwhich can change quantitative results, but has little impact on the qualitative dynamics\nof the network.\nThe hypothesis (H2) is used only to determine the neurons that fire (those of the set\nJ of the equation (4)), but both excitatory and inhibitory interactions are considered to\nupdate the states of the neurons that do not fire (r.h.s. of equation (4)). Hypothesis (H2)\nis a technical hypothesis that we need to prove our results, but it solves an indetermination\nthat appears anyway in any network with instantaneous interactions and has a biological\ninterpretation, as we explain now. In a model for which the interactions are not instantaneous, during a short time interval \u03c4 where the neuron are interacting, synaptic weights of\ndifferent signs are added to the potential of the post\u2013synaptic neuron in a certain order. If\nthe sum of the excitatory weights is larger than the threshold but the total sum of synaptic\nweight is smaller than the threshold, in the time interval \u03c4 , the following two situations\ncan arise:\n1) Excitatory signals arrive first to a neuron i, and their sum is large enough to make\nit fire. Then, neuron i fires, and besides, due to the refractory period, the sum of the\ninhibitory signals that arrive delayed to neuron i does not change its potential Vi \u2243 0.\n2) The same excitatory and inhibitory signals that in case 1) arrive to neuron i, but in the\nreverse order. Then Vi initially decreases and when the positive excitatory signals arrive\ndelayed to the neuron i they are not enough to make it fire.\nWhen the interactions are instantaneous, it is possible that excitatory and inhibitory\nsignals arrive to neuron i at the same time, since the time interval \u03c4 while the neurons\nare interacting is collapsed to zero. The previous example shows that the algebraic sum of\nthe excitations and the inhibitions received during the time interval \u03c4 is not necessarily a\nrealistic criterion to decide if the neuron i fires or not. Hypothesis (H2) is an alternative\ncriterion, which coincides with the one of the algebraic sum in most situations, but assumes\nthat the positive interactions act faster than the negative ones when an indetermination\nexists. It can also be seen as a way to take into account that excitatory synapsis are more\nfrequent than inhibitory synapsis in some part of the nervous system [22].\n\n2.2\n\nThe Poincar\u00e9 return map\n\nIn order to analyze the global dynamics of the IF neural network, we reduce it to an\nequivalent discrete time dynamical system, namely a Poincar\u00e9 return map. In this section,\nwe introduce all the important notions we use in the sequel of the paper. Among then\nwe define a Poincar\u00e9 section in the phase space, we compute the waiting time before the\nspontaneous firing of the network, we explain in details the rules of the firing regime,\nwe introduce a partition of the Poincar\u00e9 section which atoms are the sets of the initial\nconditions leading the same neurons to fire in the firing regime, and we derive a Poincar\u00e9\nreturn map of the network.\n6\n\n\fPoincar\u00e9 section \u03a3: Since the potential of a neuron is always larger than \u03b1 and always\nsmaller than \u03b8, the states of the network always belong to the n-dimensional space Q =\n[\u03b1, \u03b8]n . By definition of the model, the network never stops to emit spikes (since \u03b2 > \u03b8).\nIt exists then arbitrarily large times such that the potential of a neuron is reset to zero.\nIn other words, any solution of the model returns infinitely many times to the set:\n\u03a3=\n\nn\n[\n\n\u03a3\u0302j\n\nwhere\n\nj=1\n\n\u03a3\u0302j = {V \u2208 Q : Vj = 0}.\n\n(5)\n\nThe set \u03a3 is the Poincar\u00e9 section that we will consider. The topology we use is the one\ninduced by the embedding \u03a3 \u2282 Rn . Specifically, we consider in \u03a3 the metric derived from\nthe supremun norm of Rn , denoted k * k in this paper and defined by kVk = max |Vi |.\ni\u2208I\n\nTo sum up the principal steps of the construction of the return map, let us follow an\norbit of the network. Suppose the initial state of the network is V \u2208 \u03a3. If V is such that\nVi < \u03b8 for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, then the network is in the sub-threshold regime and there is\na waiting time t\u0304(V) > 0 before a neuron reaches the threshold potential. At the instant\nt\u0304(V) the network enters in the firing regime, and a set J(V) of neurons emit some spikes.\nThe potential of these neurons is then reset to 0 and the states of the other neurons that\ndid not spike during the firing regime, because excitations were not enough, is updated\naccording to the interactions received. The network is back in the sub-threshold regime in\na point \u03c1(V) of \u03a3, which is the value at point V of the return map \u03c1 we want to construct.\nThe formula of the return map is the same for all V sharing a same J(V), this why we\nwill introduce a partition P of \u03a3 which atoms are precisely the points with a same J(V).\nNow we detailed the computation of t\u0304(V) > 0, J(V), P and \u03c1.\nWaiting time t\u0304(V): Solving the system (2) leads to the time t map \u03c6t = (\u03c6t1 , . . . , \u03c6tn )\nwhere for each i \u2208 I and t \u2208 R\n\u03c6ti (V) = (Vi \u2212 \u03b2)e\u2212\u03b3t + \u03b2\n\n\u2200 V \u2208 Rn .\n\n(6)\n\nThus, if at time t = 0 the network is in the state V \u2208 \u03a3, it enters in the firing regime at\ntime:\nt\u0304(V) := min ti (V) where ti (V) := inf{t > 0 : \u03c6ti (V) > \u03b8}.\n(7)\ni\u2208{1,...,n}\n\nNote that t\u0304(V) is the value of t0 of formula (4) when the initial state of the network is\nV. In the particular case where V \u2208 \u03a3 is such that Vi = \u03b8 for some i, the waiting time is\nequal to 0, if not it is positive. Note also that if t\u0304(V) = ti (V) the expression of the time\nt map a time t\u0304(V) is given by\nt\u0304(V)\n\n\u03c6i\n\n(V) = \u03b8\n\nt\u0304(V)\n\nand \u03c6k\n\n(V) = \u03b2 \u2212\n\n(\u03b2 \u2212 Vk )(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)\n(\u03b2 \u2212 Vi )\n\n\u2200 k 6= i.\n\n(8)\n\nWe will often use this expression latter on.\nFiring regime t = t\u0304(V): By definition (7), at time t\u0304(V) some component of the vector\n\u03c6t\u0304(V) (V) are equal to \u03b8; those corresponding to the neurons which potential reaches the\n7\n\n\fthreshold in a smaller time than the potential of all the other neurons. We need to\ncharacterize this set of neurons that fire spontaneously because they are part of the set\nJ of formula (4). It depends of course of the value of V (as well as J). This is why we\nintroduce the following cover of \u03a3:\n\n\u03a3=\n\nn\n[\n\n\u03a3i\n\nwhere\n\ni=1\n\n\u03a3i = {V \u2208 \u03a3 : t(V) = ti (V)}.\n\n(9)\n\nA set \u03a3i of this cover, is the set of the initial states in \u03a3 such that the neuron i fires\nt\u0304(V)\nspontaneously after the waiting time t(V), that is, if V \u2208 \u03a3i then \u03c6i (V) = \u03b8. Since\nseveral neurons may reach \u03b8 at the same time, these sets are not pairwise disjoint (and\nthus forms a cover instead of a partition of \u03a3), but they have pairwise disjoint interiors.\nWe can states any way that the neurons that fires spontaneously at time t(V) are those\nof the set of indexes:\nJ0 (V) = {i \u2208 I : V \u2208 \u03a3i }.\nNow, the firing of the neurons of J0 (V) may instantaneously excite other neurons,\nwhich may also fire in turn at the same instant, and excite other neurons or not. One more\ntime, we need to characterize all the neurons participating in this instantaneous avalanche\nprocess, i.e. the set J of formula (4), that we denote until now J(V). We can determine\nJ(V) introducing a recursive sequence of sets of indexes {Jm (V)}m>0 , where each Jm (V)\nis the set of neurons that have fired once until the step m of the avalanche process. Taking\ninto account the temporary inertia (the refractory period) of real neurons after firing, and\nconsidering Hypothesis (H2), this sequence must obey the following induction rule for all\nm > 1:\nt(V)\n\nJm (V) = Jm\u22121 (V) \u222a {k \u2208 I \\ Jm\u22121 (V) : \u03c6k\n\n(V) +\n\nX\n\nHik > \u03b8}.\n\n(10)\n\ni\u2208Jm\u22121 (V) : Hik >0\n\nAs an example, J1 (V) contains the neurons of J0 (V) and possibly additional neurons that\nfire because of some excitatory interactions with the neurons of J0 (V). Note that this\nadditional neurons, which are those of the second set of the union that defines J1 (V),\ncannot be neurons of J0 (V). In our definition (10), they are not considered as a possible\nreceptors of spikes, in order to take into account of a refractory phenomenon in the model.\nIndeed, a set Jm (V) is the disjoint union of the neurons of Jm\u22121 (V) with new neurons\nfiring by interactions with those of Jm\u22121 (V).\nSince the set I is finite, there exists a m0 > 0, such that no new neurons are incremented\nto Jm0 +1 (V) with respect to Jm0 (V), either because Jm0 \u22121 (V) is the whole all set I, or\nbecause the sum of the excitatory interactions of the neurons of Jm0 \u22121 (V) is not enough\nto make fire some new neurons. For such a m0 we have Jm0 (V) = Jm0 \u22121 (V) and we can\nconclude that the set of the neurons that emit a spike at time t\u0304(V) can be written as:\nJ(V) =\n\n[\n\nJm (V) = Jm0 (V).\n\nm\u2208N\n\n8\n\n(11)\n\n\fIf there is no excitatory neurons in J0 (V), then Jm (V) = J0 (V) for all m \u2208 N and\nJ(V) = J0 (V). If J0 (V) contains excitatory neurons, then J(V) may contain more\nneurons than J0 (V).\nPartition P of \u03a3: As shown in the previous construction, to each initial state of the\nnetwork V \u2208 \u03a3 it is associated the set J(V) of the neurons that fire at time t\u0304(V). So we\ncan consider the function J(*) of \u03a3 into the set P (I) of all the nonempty subsets of I and\nuse its pre-images to get a partition P of \u03a3:\nP = {\u03a3J }J\u2208P (I)\n\nwhere\n\n\u03a3J = {V \u2208 \u03a3 : J(V) = J}.\n\n(12)\n\nGiven a set of neurons J \u2208 P (I), the set \u03a3J is the set of all the initial states in \u03a3 such that\nthe neurons that fire after the waiting time t(V) are exactly those of J. For example, if\nV \u2208 \u03a3{i} , then at time t(V), only the neuron i fires (which makes a difference with the set\n\u03a3i of the cover (9)). Note that t\u0304(V) is not necessarily the same for each V in a same \u03a3J . It\nis straightforward to check that P forms a partition of \u03a3: on one hand, to each V \u2208 \u03a3 it is\nassociated some J(V) and thus some \u03a3J , and on the other hand, if V \u2208 \u03a3J \u2229 \u03a3J \u2032 6= \u2205 then\nby definition J = J(V) = J \u2032 and \u03a3J = \u03a3J \u2032 . According to the values of the parameters of\nthe model Hji , \u03b3, \u03b2 and \u03b1, some \u03a3J may be empty. Nevertheless, there is always at least\none nonempty set \u03a3J in the partition P.\nNow we can give the formula of a return map in \u03a3:\nProposition 2.2. Under Hypothesis (H1) and Hypothesis (H2), the map \u03c1 : \u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3 which\ncomponents \u03c11 . . . , \u03c1n are defined in each atom \u03a3J of the partition P of \u03a3 by:\n\u03c1i (V) = 0\n\nif\n\ni\u2208J\n\nand\n\nt\u0304(V)\n\n\u03c1i (V) = max{\u03b1, \u03c6i\n\n(V) +\n\nX\nj\u2208J\n\nHji }\n\nif\n\ni\u2208\n/J\n\n(13)\n\nis a return map in \u03a3 of the model.\nProof. Take V \u2208 \u03a3, and let J \u2208 P (I) such that V \u2208 \u03a3J . From (6) and (7) we deduce\nthat the orbit of V under the dynamics of the model satisfies:\nV(t) = \u03c6t (V)\n\n\u2200 t \u2208 [0, t\u0304(V))\n\nand\n\nlim V(t) = \u03c6t\u0304(V) (V).\n\n(14)\n\nt\u2191t\u0304(V)\n\nAt time t\u0304(V) the network enter in the firing regime and the neurons that fires are those\nof J, since V \u2208 \u03a3J . According to (4), the potential of the neurons of J is reset and the\npotential of the other neurons suffers excitatory and inhibitory interactions from those of\nJ. Together with Hypothesis (H1) it implies:\nlim Vi (t) = 0 if\n\nt\u2193t\u0304(V)\n\ni\u2208J\n\nand\n\nt\u0304(V)\n\nlim Vi (t) = max{\u03b1, \u03c6i\n\nt\u2193t\u0304(V)\n\n(V) +\n\nX\nj\u2208J\n\nHji }\n\nif\n\ni\u2208\n/ J.\n\nThus, \u03c1(V) := limt\u2193t\u0304(V) V(t) is a point of \u03a3, which is the new state of the network when\nit comes back in the sub-threshold regime.\n9\n\n\fAn orbits {\u03c1n (V)}{n\u2208N} of the return map gives the states of the network immediately\nafter each spike (or simultaneous group of spikes). However, the entire orbit of the network\ncan be reconstructed from the orbit by the return map using (14), and all the properties\nof the network can be deduced from those of the return map. In particular, the network\nhas a periodic orbit if and only if the return map also has.\nThe return map does not satisfy standard hypothesis of the dynamical systems theory,\nsuch as differentiability, or continuity in its entire domain. Actually, \u03c1 is continuous in\nthe interior of each set \u03a3J of the partition P, but not necessarily in their union \u03a3. At a\npoint in the boundary \u2202\u03a3J of a set \u03a3J , generically the return map is not continuous, since\na small perturbation may belong to the interior of \u03a3J or to another set \u03a3J \u2032 and thus it\ncan change the set of the firing neurons. A detailed study of these properties is given in\nSection 5.1.\nIn general, it is not trivial to characterize the atoms of P because they depend strongly\non the interactions. However, if a network is completely inhibitory, when a neuron fires, it\ndoes it spontaneously. This makes easier the computation of P, since it allows to replace\nJ(V) by J0 (V) in the definition (12), and this last set does not depend on the interactions\nbut only on the characteristics of the sub-threshold regime. For such networks, it is then\npossible to show that the boundary of P are the sets \u03a3J such that J contains more than\none neuron. It follows that the discontinuity points of the return map are the initial states\nleading two neurons or more to fire together spontaneously.\n\n3\n\nContraction properties of the return map\n\nIn several mathematical studies of the global dynamics of IF neural networks, the considered model has the property to be piecewise contractive in the whole phase space (see\nDefinition 3.6). This property reflects the presence of dissipation in the networks. It is\nintroduced in the model to that aim [9], or it is a consequence of the absence of excitatory\ninteractions [5, 7] or of the predomimance of the inhibitory interactions [20]. In our case,\nwhere none of these hypothesis is assumed, it is not a property of the return map that\nholds generically in the space of the parameters of the system. Indeed, in Theorem 2, we\nprove that there exist open sets in the space of the parameters such that the return map\nis not piecewise contractive in a subregion of the phase space. This result holds for any\nmetric derived from a norm and in this sense is an inherent property of the system.\nNevertheless, we also show in Proposition 3.6 that it always (co)exists a subregion of\nthe phase space where the return map is piecewise contractive. Moreover, the size of this\nregion increases when the external current Iext decreases. By Theorem 2, a contractive\nregion cannot coincide with the whole phase space for any values of the interactions.\nHowever, we show in Theorem 3 that if the interactions are not too small, or equivalently\nthe external current is not too strong, then it is possible to find a metric for which the\nreturn map is piecewise contracting in the whole phase space, provided the network has\nnot only excitatory neurons.\nDefinition 3.1. We say that a subset C of the Poincar\u00e9 section \u03a3 is a contractive zone\nfor the return map \u03c1, if there exist a finite partition Pc of C, a constant 0 < \u03bbc < 1, and\n10\n\n\fa norm k * kc such that\n\nk\u03c1(V) \u2212 \u03c1(W)kc 6 \u03bbc kV \u2212 Wkc\n\n(15)\n\nfor all V and W in a same piece of Pc . If there exists a forward invariant contractive\nzone, that is \u03c1(C) \u2282 C, then \u03c1 is said to be piecewise contractive in C.\n\n3.1\n\nExpansion and contraction in the Poincar\u00e9 section\n\nThe question we address now, is the existence of a norm k*kc such that the whole Poincar\u00e9\nsection \u03a3 would be a contractive zone with respect to the natural partition P defined by\nthe equality (12). The following theorem shows that for some networks such a norm does\nnot exist.\nTheorem 2. Under the hypothesis (H1) and (H2), there exists an open region of the\nvalues of the interactions such that, for any norm k * kc , the Poincar\u00e9 section \u03a3 is not a\ncontractive zone with respect to the natural partition P.\nIn order to construct a subregion of the Poincar\u00e9 section where the return map fails\nto be piecewise contractive, let us define for all i 6= j \u2208 I the following sets:\np\n\u0393i := {V \u2208 \u03a3 : c\u2217 < Vi < \u03b8, Vk = 0 \u2200 k 6= i} where c\u2217 := \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8).\np\nNote that for any 0 < \u03b8 < \u03b2 we have \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8 < \u03b2(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8) < \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8/2 which implies that\n\u03b8/2 < c\u2217 < \u03b8. So, a set \u0393i consists of the initial states of the network such that all the\nneurons have their potential equal to zero, except the neuron i, whose potential is bigger\nthan the quantity c\u2217 > \u03b8/2 and smaller than \u03b8. Therefore, for all V \u2208 \u0393i the neuron i\nreaches the threshold before the other ones, that is t\u0304(V) = ti (V), and is the neuron that\ntriggers the firing regime.\nNow we state and prove the following lemma establishing a key property to prove\nTheorem 2.\nLemma 3.2. Let i \u2208 I and suppose \u0393i \u2282 \u03a3J for some J \u2208 P (I), then for all V 6= W \u2208 \u0393i\nsuch that \u03c1(V) and \u03c1(W) are bigger that \u03b1, we have\n|\u03c1k (V) \u2212 \u03c1k (W)| > |Vi \u2212 Wi |\n\nif\n\nk\u2208\n/ J,\n\nand moreover k\u03c1(V) \u2212 \u03c1(W)k > kV \u2212 Wk.\nProof. Let us compute \u03c1(V). On one hand, since V \u2208 \u03a3J , we have \u03c1k (V) = 0 for all\nk \u2208 J. On the other hand, since V \u2208 \u0393i , we have Vi > Vk = 0 for all k 6= i which implies\nthat t\u0304(V) = ti (V). From the formula of the return map, it follows that for all k \u2208\n/J\nt (V)\n\n\u03c1k (V) = \u03c6ki\n\n(V) +\n\nX\nj\u2208J\n\nHjk = \u03b2 \u2212\n11\n\n\u03b2(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8) X\n+\nHjk ,\n\u03b2 \u2212 Vi\nj\u2208J\n\n\fwhere the second equality is obtained applying (8) with Vk = 0. The same computation\nbeing true for \u03c1(W) we deduce that for all k \u2208\n/J\nt (V)\n\n|\u03c1k (V) \u2212 \u03c1k (W)| = \u03c6ki\n=\n\nt (W)\n\n(V) \u2212 \u03c6ki\n\n(W)\n\n\u03b2(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)\n\u03b2(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)\n(Wi \u2212 Vi ) >\n|Vi \u2212 Wi | = |Vi \u2212 Wi |. (16)\n(\u03b2 \u2212 Wi )(\u03b2 \u2212 Vi )\n(\u03b2 \u2212 c\u2217 )2\n\nNow, k\u03c1(V) \u2212 \u03c1(W)k = max{|\u03c1k (V) \u2212 \u03c1k (W)|, k \u2208 I} > |Vi \u2212 Wi | = kV \u2212 Wk, which\ncompletes the proof.\nActually, the hypothesis \u0393i \u2282 \u03a3J for some J \u2208 P (I) can be replaced by the weaker\nhypothesis: \u0393i \u2229 \u03a3J is not empty and is not a singleton, for some J \u2208 P (I). Then, the\nresults of the lemma remain true for all V 6= W \u2208 \u0393i \u2229 \u03a3J . This weaker hypothesis always\nholds as \u0393i is infinite and the partition P of \u03a3 is finite. This observation implies that the\nreturn map always exhibits expansion in some part of its phase space, independently of\nthe values of the interactions (which determine the sets \u03a3J ), provided they are enough to\nensure that \u03c1(V) and \u03c1(W) are bigger than \u03b1.\nLemma 3.2 is stated for the distance induced by the supremum norm, and a priori,\nit may exist another norm for which the contraction property holds in the whole phase\nspace, even in the \u0393i . Now, we are going to show that at least for some networks such\na norm cannot exit. Examples of such networks have two excitatory neurons i 6= j \u2208 I\nverifying simultaneously the three following open conditions (O1), (O2), and (O3) :\n\u2022 (O1) The neurons i and j cannot be strongly excited by the sequel of the network:\nX\nHls < \u03b8 \u2212 c\u2217 \u2200 s \u2208 {i, j},\nl6=s : Hls >0\n\n\u2022 (O2) A spike from i or j to any other neuron of the network produces a strong\nexcitation:\nHsk > \u03b8 \u2200 s \u2208 {i, j} and k \u2208\n/ {i, j},\n\u2022 (O3) The sum of the negative and positive interactions that i and j can receive is\npositive:\nX\nHls > 0 \u2200 s \u2208 {i, j}.\nl6=s\n\nFor sake of simplicity we make the proof of Theorem 2 with this set of parameters, but\nother sets can be chosen. In particular, the condition (O2) can be replaced by a more\nbiologically realistic condition, which does not impose some interactions to be bigger than\nthe threshold potential, see Remark 3.4. The important point for our proof to work, is to\nensure that \u03c1p (\u0393i ) intersects \u0393i for some p and that the dilatation is conserved a least for\nsome couple of points during the first pth iterations. The advantage of the proposed set of\nparameters is that it permits to show intuitively that this property is fulfilled for p = 2,\nas shown in the following.\n12\n\n\fLet us consider a network verifying (O1) to (O3) and whose state V \u2208 \u0393i . Then, by\ndefinition of \u0393i , the neuron i fires spontaneously at time t\u0304(V) = ti (V). At this instant,\nby condition (O2), the firing of i induces the simultaneous firing of all the other neurons,\nexpect j which is not sufficiently excited (condition (O1)). Thus, the set of the neurons\nthat fire at time t\u0304(V) is J(V) = I \\ {j} and it follows that: V \u2208 \u03a3I\\{j} and \u03c1k (V) = 0 for\nall k 6= j. Now, if t\u0304(V) is sufficiently large, that is if the initial potential Vi of the neuron\ni is sufficiently near c\u2217 , then, just before the firing regime, the potential of the neuron j is\nnear c\u2217 (actually it is equal to c\u2217 is Vi = c\u2217 ). Thanks to condition (O3), the interactions\nof the neuron j with the network during the firing regime, help its potential to become\nlarger than c\u2217 . In other words, \u03c1j (V) \u2208 (c\u2217 , \u03b8) and \u03c1(V) \u2208 \u0393j . We can conclude that for\nthe considered network \u03c1(\u0393i ) \u2229 \u0393j 6= \u2205. These results are stated in Lemma 3.3 and their\nrigorous proof is detailed in appendix 7.1.\nLemma 3.3. Let i 6= j \u2208 I. For the open region of values of the interactions that satisfy\nthe conditions (O1) to (O3), the set \u0393i is a subset of \u03a3I\\{j} , the set \u0393j is a subset of\n\u03a3I\\{i} , and there exists (a, b) \u2282 (c\u2217 , \u03b8) such that for all V \u2208 \u0393i satisfying Vi \u2208 (a, b), we\nhave \u03c1(V) \u2208 \u0393j . Moreover, if W 6= V \u2208 \u0393i then \u03c1(V) 6= \u03c1(W).\nProof. See the appendix 7.1.\nAccording to Lemma 3.3, there exist V 6= W \u2208 \u0393i such that \u03c1(V) 6= \u03c1(W) \u2208 \u0393j .\nApplying Lemma 3.2 to \u03c1(V) and \u03c1(W) we obtain:\n|\u03c1i (\u03c1(V)) \u2212 \u03c1i (\u03c1(W))| > |\u03c1j (V) \u2212 \u03c1j (W)|\nsince \u0393j \u2282 \u03a3I\\{i} . Now, applying once again Lemma 3.2, but this time to V and W we\nobtain:\n|\u03c1j (V) \u2212 \u03c1j (W)| > |Vi \u2212 Wi |\nsince \u0393i \u2282 \u03a3I\\{j} . So we have,\n\n|\u03c12i (V) \u2212 \u03c12i (W)| > |Vi \u2212 Wi |.\n\n(17)\n\nProof. of Theorem 2 Let us show that (17) is incompatible with the existence of a norm\nk * kc such that \u03a3 is a contractive zone. If we suppose such a norm exists, according to\nDefinition 3.1, for the V and W of (17) we have\nk\u03c12 (V) \u2212 \u03c12 (W)kc 6 \u03bbc k\u03c1(V) \u2212 \u03c1(W)kc 6 \u03bb2c kV \u2212 Wkc < kV \u2212 Wkc .\n\n(18)\n\nNow consider the restriction of the norm k * kc to the set Gi := {0}i\u22121 \u00d7 R \u00d7 {0}n\u2212i ,\nthat is the norm k * kc,i defined by kUkc,i := kUkc for all U \u2208 Gi . As k * kc,i is a norm\nin a vector space isomorphic to R, there exists \u03bci > 0 independent of U \u2208 Gi such that\nkUkc,i = \u03bci |Ui |. Therefore, for all U \u2208 Gi , we have kUkc = kUkc,i = \u03bci |Ui |. As \u03c12 (V)\nand \u03c12 (W) belong to Gi (recall that \u03c1(V), \u03c1(W) \u2208 \u0393j \u2282 \u03a3I\\{i} ) and as V and W belong\nto \u0393i \u2282 Gi , the inequality (18) can be written:\nk\u03c12 (V) \u2212 \u03c12 (W)kc = \u03bci |\u03c12i (V) \u2212 \u03c12i (W)| < \u03bci |Vi \u2212 Wi | = kV \u2212 Wkc\nwhich contradicts (17).\n13\n\n(19)\n\n\fRemark 3.4. 1) If we consider the sets \u0393i,d := {V \u2208 \u03a3 : c\u2217 < Vi < d, Vk = 0 \u2200 k 6= i}\nwhere d < \u03b8, the condition (O2) can be relaxed, without changing the important lines of\nthe proof of Theorem 2. Indeed, the condition (O2) ensures that when the initial state\nof the network belongs to \u0393i the firing of the neuron i induces the firing of any neuron\nk\u2208\n/ {i, j}. But if V is in \u0393i,d and d is near from c\u2217 , the waiting time before the firing of\nthe neuron i will be large enough for the potential of any neuron k 6= i to be near from\nc\u2217 . In the limit d = c\u2217 , if V \u2208 \u0393i,d , an excitation Hik > \u03b8 \u2212 c\u2217 from i to k is enough to\nmake k fire (use (8) with Vi = c\u2217 and Vk = 0). Thus, the condition (O2) can be replaced\nby the more realistic condition Hsk > \u03b4(d) for all k \u2208\n/ {i, j} and s \u2208 {i, j}, where \u03b4(*) is\na decreasing function of d such that limd\u2192c\u2217 \u03b4(d) = \u03b8 \u2212 c\u2217 . This former limit is always\nsmaller that \u03b8/2 and tends to 0 when c\u2217 goes to \u03b8 (that is when \u03b2 goes to \u03b8, which implies\nthat the waiting time tends to infinity).\n2) On the other hand, completely different sets of parameters can be used to prove Theorem\n2 using the same sets \u0393i and a similar proof. Nevertheless, in order to be able to compare\ndifferent norms, and to obtain the final contradiction (19), the set \u0393i must be subsets of\nGi and the parameters must ensure the strong restriction \u03c12 (\u0393i ) \u2229 Gi 6= \u2205. This can be\ndone with various sets of parameters, but excitatory interactions plays an important role\nto reset the potential of all the neuron excepted one.\nRemark 3.5. 1) The result of Theorem 2 may seem unexpected, since the non zero\ncomponents of the return map are just translations applied to the time t map \u03c6t , which\nhas a uniform negative exponent Lyapunov \u2212\u03b3. The return map fails to be piecewise\ncontractive because the waiting time t\u0304(*) to enter in the firing regime depends on initial\nstate. Therefore, when the values of the return map at two different points are compared,\nwe evaluate \u03c6t with different values of t, by mean of the map \u03c6t\u0304(*) (*), which is not necessarily\ncontractive. In particular, \u03c6t\u0304(*) (*) is expansive in any set \u0393i , as shown by (16). This\nproperty is transmitted to the return map in any intersection of the sets \u0393i with an atom\nof the partition P, independently from the values of the interactions.\n2) The existence of expansion in a non trivial and invariant compact part of the phase\nspace is considered as a source of chaos. In general the sets \u0393i are not invariant. The\nrole of the conditions (O1) to (O3), is precisely to guaranty the existence of an invariant\nsubset in \u0393i \u222a \u0393j . Indeed, T\nfor the networks verifying these conditions, it is possible to show\nthat the invariant subset m>0 \u03c1\u2212m (\u0393i \u222a \u0393j ) is non-empty4 . Unfortunately, it fails to be a\nchaotic attractor because it is trivial: it is just a periodic repeller (period 2). Nevertheless,\nit is a sufficient result to prove that the return map cannot be piecewise contractive in\nthe whole phase space for any value of the parameters, even equipping \u03a3 with a different\nnorm. On the other hand, we cannot exclude the possibility of the existence of more\ncomplicated regions of the phase space and of the parameters for which there exists a non\ntrivial chaotic set and we hope the proof of Theorem 2 gives a strategy to search it.\nLemma 3.2 establishes the existence of some regions of the Poincar\u00e9 section where the\nreturn map expands the distances, the sets \u0393i . However, there is always a subregion of \u03a3\nwhich is a contractive zone, as stated by the following Proposition.\n4\n\nThe second part of the proof of Lemma 3.3 is the first step of the proof of this statement.\n\n14\n\n\fProposition 3.6. For any c \u2208 [0, \u03b8], let us define the subset Cc of the Poincar\u00e9 section by\nCc := {V \u2208 \u03a3 : \u03b1 6 Vi 6 c \u2200 i \u2208 I}.\n\n(20)\n\nThe set C0 is a contractive zone with respect to the partition P. Moreover, if\n\u03b2 < \u03b2+ (\u03b1)\n\nwith\n\np\n1\n\u03b2+ (\u03b1) := (\u03b1 + 2\u03b8 + \u03b12 + 4\u03b8 2 )\n2\n\nthen for any c \u2208 (0, c\u0304) where\nc\u0304 := \u03b2 \u2212\n\n\u0011\np\n1\u0010\n\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8 + (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)2 + 4(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) ,\n2\n\n(21)\n\nthe set Cc is non empty, and is a contractive zone with respect to the partition P.\nFor any value of the parameters, there is a contractive zone in the Poincar\u00e9 section:\nthe set C0 . Moreover, if some restrictions are imposed to \u03b2, namely \u03b8 < \u03b2 < \u03b2+ (\u03b1), then\nc\u0304 > 0, and there exist larger contractive zones: all the sets Cc with 0 < c < c\u0304. The nearer\n\u03b2 is to \u03b8, the larger is c\u0304. In particular, when \u03b2 tends to \u03b8, the whole Poincar\u00e9 section\ntends to be a contractive zone. On the other hand when \u03b2 tends to \u03b2+ (\u03b1) the quantity c\u0304\ntends to 0.\nThe quantity \u03b2+ (\u03b1) is an increasing function of \u03b1 and therefore\nlim \u03b2+ (\u03b1) < \u03b2+ (\u03b1) < \u03b2+ (0),\n\n\u03b1\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nthat is\n\n\u03b2+ (\u03b1) \u2208 (\u03b8, 2\u03b8) \u2200 \u03b1 < 0.\n\nIt follows that there always exists some values of \u03b2 satisfying the condition \u03b8 < \u03b2 < \u03b2+ (\u03b1),\neven for \u03b1 arbitrary small. In particular if \u03b1 is near to 0 then \u03b2 can be chosen near to 2\u03b8.\nHowever, if \u03b2 is larger than 2\u03b8, then the only set Cc which is a contractive zone is C0 .\n\nRecall that \u03b2 is proportional to the external current Iext applied to each neuron.\nTherefore, the previous analysis reflects the fact that weak currents are more favorable to\nthe presence of contraction (or dissipation) in the model.\nProof. of Proposition 3.6 First, note that Cc 6= \u2205 if and only if c > 0, since any point of \u03a3\nhas at least a component equal to 0. The set C0 is always non empty, but for a set Cc with\n0 < c < c\u0304 to be non empty we have to ensure that c\u0304 > 0. This last condition is satisfied if\nand only if\np\n2\u03b2 \u2212 (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8) > (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)2 + 4(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1).\nSince both sides of the inequality are positive, elevating to the square each sides we obtain\nan equivalent expression, which after simplifications is:\n\u03b2 2 \u2212 (\u03b1 + 2\u03b8)\u03b2 + \u03b1\u03b8 < 0.\nThis equation is satisfied if and only if \u03b2 verifies:\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03b1 + 2\u03b8 + \u03b12 + 4\u03b8 2\n\u03b1 + 2\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b12 + 4\u03b8 2\n<\u03b2<\n= \u03b2+ (\u03b1).\n\u03b2\u2212 (\u03b1) :=\n2\n2\n15\n\n\fAs \u03b2\u2212 (*) is an increasing function of \u03b1, it follows that \u03b2\u2212 (\u03b1) < \u03b2\u2212 (0) = 0, which is always\nsmaller than \u03b2 (recall that \u03b2 > \u03b8 > 0 > \u03b1). We conclude that for all c \u2208 (0, c\u0304) the set\nCc 6= \u2205 if \u03b2 < \u03b2+ (\u03b1).\nNow we show that for all c \u2208 [0, c\u0304) there exists \u03bbc < 1 such that for any J \u2208 P (I) we\nhave:\nk\u03c1(V) \u2212 \u03c1(W)k 6 \u03bbc kV \u2212 Wk\n\u2200 V, W \u2208 \u03a3J \u2229 Cc .\n(22)\nSuppose V, W \u2208 \u03a3J \u2229 Cc and let i, l \u2208 J be such that V \u2208 \u03a3i and W \u2208 \u03a3l (recall (9)).\nLet k \u2208 I.

The quantity \u03bbc being an increasing function\nof with c, we have \u03bbc < \u03bbc\u0304 for all c < c\u0304, which ends the proof.\nIn this section we have shown that there exists some regions of the phase space where\nthe return map expands the distances (the sets \u0393i ) and other regions where it contracts\nthem (the sets Cc ). Moreover, for some values of the interactions, it is not possible to make\nthe return map piecewise contractive in the sets \u0393i by changing the working norm. This\nproves that the piecewise contractive character of the return map is not a trivial property,\nand to ensure it in the whole phase space, it is necessary to impose adequate conditions\nto the parameters of the model. In the forthcoming section we propose such conditions.\n\n3.2\n\nParameters of global contraction\n\nProposition 3.6 gives concrete examples of a regions of the Poincar\u00e9 section, denoted Cc\nwith c < c\u0304, where the return map is contractive. The set Cc\u0304 is not a contractive zone in\nthe sense of Definition 3.1 because for this set \u03bbc\u0304 = 1. Nevertheless, it contains all the\ncontractive zones Cc with c < c\u0304 and will help the proof of the results of this section. In\nthe sequel we give conditions on the parameter values (Hypothesis (H3) and (H4)) for\nwhich we prove that Cc\u0304 has two important features. First, once an orbit enters into Cc\u0304 , it\ndoes not leave it, furthermore, it stays in a contractive zone contained in Cc\u0304 (Proposition\n3.8). Second, if at least one neuron is inhibitory, then any orbit will finally enter into Cc\u0304\n(Proposition 3.9). These two important properties of Cc\u0304 allow to show that after changing\nadequately the metric in \u03a3 and considering a refined partition of P, the return map\n17\n\n\fbecomes piecewise contractive in the whole Poincar\u00e9 section (Theorem 3). This result\nholds under hypothesis (H1) to (H4) and if at least one of the neurons is inhibitory. The\ncase for which all the neurons are excitatory, which mainly provokes the synchronization\nof the whole network, will be studied in Section 4, without assuming Hypothesis (H1) to\n(H4).\nAlong this section, we suppose that the parameters verify the following two hypothesis:\n(H3) The external current Iext is not too strong, in such a way that \u03b2 < \u03b2+ (\u03b1) and the\ninteractions Hji satisfy:\nmin |Hji | > \u01eb\nj6=i\n\nwhere \u01eb :=\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010p\n(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)2 + 4(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) \u2212 (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8) .\n2\n\n(H4) We assume the Dale's principle: a neuron is either excitatory or inhibitory. In other\nwords, the network does not contain mixed neurons.\nHypothesis (H3) and (H4) define the region of the parameters for which we study the global\ndynamics of IF neural networks later on, unless otherwise specified. Hypothesis (H3) is\nan open condition relating the strength of the external current and of the resistance of the\nmembrane (recall that \u03b2 = RIext ) with the intensity of the interactions. It first guaranties\nthe existence of a contractive zone larger than C0 by imposing \u03b2 < \u03b2+ (\u03b1) (see Proposition\n3.6). On the other hand, it imposes to the interactions to have a lower bound \u01eb > 0 (but\nno upper bound is imposed). This lower bound is an increasing function of \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8. In the\nextreme case, where \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8 tends to \u03b2+ (\u03b1) \u2212 \u03b8, the lower bound tends to \u03b8. But, if \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8\ntends to 0 then, to satisfy (H3), the interactions have to be different from 0, but can be\narbitrarily near to 0. In other words, given fixed values of the interactions, our description\nof the dynamics of the network holds for a range of external currents such that \u03b2 = RIext\nis sufficiently near to \u03b8. Or equivalently, given a fixed value of RIext , this description apply\nto all the networks with sufficiently strong interactions.\nIn Section 2.2 we noted that, for every V \u2208 \u03a3 such that J0 (V) contains only inhibitory\nneurons, J(V) = J0 (V). If moreover V \u2208 Cc\u0304 , the set J0 (V) has the following additional\nproperty:\nLemma 3.7. If V \u2208 Cc\u0304 and an excitatory neuron fires spontaneously, that is J0 (V)\ncontains an excitatory neuron, then all the neurons fire together, that is J(V) = I.\n\nProof. Suppose V \u2208 Cc\u0304 and let i \u2208 J0 (V) 6= I. Let us compute the neurons of J1 (V).\nSuppose k \u2208 I \\ J0 (V). As t\u0304(V) = ti (V), by (8) we have:\nt(V)\n\n\u03c6k\n\n(V) = \u03b2 \u2212\n\n(\u03b2 \u2212 Vk )(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)\n.\n\u03b2 \u2212 Vi\n\n18\n\n\fAs V \u2208 Cc\u0304 , we have \u03b1 6 Vk and Vi 6 c\u0304 which implies\nt(V)\n\n\u03c6k\n\n(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)\n\u03b2 \u2212 c\u0304\n4(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)\np\n>\u03b2\u2212\n2(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8 + (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)2 + 4(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1))\n1p\n1\n>\u03b2\u2212\n(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)2 + 4(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) = (\u03b2 + \u03b8) \u2212 \u01eb > \u03b8 \u2212 \u01eb.\n2\n2\n\n(V) > \u03b2 \u2212\n\nSince J0 (V) contains an excitatory neuron, it follows that\nX\nt(V)\n\u03c6k (V) +\nHjk > \u03b8 \u2212 \u01eb + min |Hji | > \u03b8,\nj6=i\n\nj\u2208J0 (V) : Hjk >0\n\nand by definition of J1 (V), we have that k \u2208 J1 (V). We deduce that for all k \u2208 I \\ J0 (V)\nwe have k \u2208 J1 (V). Thus, for all k \u2208 I either k \u2208 J0 (V) or k \u2208 J1 (V). In both case\nk \u2208 J(V).\nThe Lemma states that for the initial states V \u2208 Cc\u0304 , it is enough that a single excitatory neuron fires to make the whole network firing simultaneously and to provoke its\nsynchronization (for more details about synchronization, see Section 4). The reason is\nthat, if V \u2208 Cc\u0304 \u2229 \u03a3i , the potential of the neuron i is small enough for the other neurons\ngetting sufficiently near to the threshold just before i reaches it. In other words, all the\nneurons get spontaneously near to the threshold in a similar time, i.e. tj (V) \u2243 t\u0304(V) for\nall j \u2208 I if V \u2208 Cc\u0304 . Therefore, even a small excitation (but bigger than \u01eb) is enough to\nhelp all the other neurons to reach the threshold in the avalanche process. Nevertheless,\nfor initial states V 6\u2208 Cc\u0304 , even if a single neuron may produce the avalanche, it does not\nnecessarily makes all the neurons fire simultaneously.\nNow we apply Lemma 3.7 to prove the existence of a forward invariant contractive\nzone in the the Poincar\u00e9 section. We recall, that in such a case \u03c1 is said to be piecewise\ncontractive.\nProposition 3.8. The set \u03a3\u2217 := \u03c1(Cc\u0304 ) is contained in Cc\u0304 , is a contractive zone, and is\nsuch that \u03c1(\u03a3\u2217 ) \u2282 \u03a3\u2217 .\nProof. We show that \u03c1(Cc\u0304 ) is contained in one of the contractive zones Cc of Proposition 3.6.\nSince the sets Cc are compact, the same will be true for the closure \u03a3\u2217 := \u03c1(Cc\u0304 ). Moreover,\nas Cc\u0304 contains all the sets Cc , it will follow that \u03a3\u2217 \u2282 Cc\u0304 and \u03c1(\u03a3\u2217 ) \u2282 \u03c1(Cc\u0304 ) \u2282 \u03c1(Cc\u0304 ) = \u03a3\u2217 .\n\nLet V \u2208 Cc\u0304 and k \u2208 I. Since by (13) we know that \u03b1 6 \u03c1k (V), we have only have\nto prove that \u03c1k (V) 6 c for some c \u2208 [0, c\u0304). Suppose k \u2208\n/ J(V), then J(V) 6= I, and as\nV \u2208 Cc\u0304 , from Lemma 3.7 we deduce that J0 (V) contains only inhibitory neurons. It implies\nthat V \u2208 \u03a3J where J := J(V) = J0 (V). Since k receives only inhibitory interactions from\nthe neurons of J, we have:\nX\nt(V)\n\u03c1k (V) = \u03c6k (V) +\nHjk < \u03b8 \u2212 min |Hji | < \u03b8 \u2212 \u01eb.\nj6=i\n\nj\u2208J\n\n19\n\n\fA straightforward computation shows that \u03b8 \u2212 \u01eb = c\u0304 and we have that \u03c1k (V) 6 \u03b8 \u2212\nmin |Hji | < c\u0304. Now, if k \u2208 J(V) then \u03c1k (V) = 0 < c\u0304. It follows that \u03c1k (V) 6 max{0, \u03b8 \u2212\nj6=i\n\nmin |Hji |} < c\u0304 for all k \u2208 I. We conclude that \u03c1(V) belongs to the contractive zone Cc\nj6=i\n\nwith c = max{0, \u03b8 \u2212 min |Hji |}.\nj6=i\n\nProposition 3.8 ensures that if an orbit of the return map falls in the contractive zone\n\u03a3\u2217 , then it stays forever in this region. The following proposition states that if the network\ncontains an inhibitory neuron, then all the orbits eventually reach the contractive zone.\nProposition 3.9. If the network contains an inhibitory neuron and if p \u2208 N is such that\n\u03b1 + p minj6=i |Hji | > \u03b8, then \u03c1p+1 (\u03a3) \u2282 \u03a3\u2217 .\nProof. Let us define for each p \u2208 N the set Zp of the points of the Poincar\u00e9 section that\nstay outside of Cc\u0304 during p iterations:\nZp := {V \u2208 \u03a3 : \u03c1j (V) \u2208 \u03a3 \\ Cc\u0304 , 1 6 j 6 p}.\nWe are going to show that if the network contains an inhibitory neuron and p is such\nthat \u03b1 + p minj6=i |Hji | > \u03b8, then Zp is empty, that is \u03c1p (\u03a3) \u2282 Cc\u0304 , and by Proposition 3.8,\n\u03c1p+1 (\u03a3) \u2282 \u03a3\u2217 . Afterwards, i denotes an inhibitory neuron of the network.\nFirst suppose that Z1 6= \u2205 and take V \u2208 Z1 . By construction of the set Z1 , if V \u2208 Z1 ,\nthen \u03c1k (V) > c\u0304 for some k \u2208 I. This neuron k cannot fire at time t\u0304(V), since if it would\nthen \u03c1k (V) = 0, which contradicts \u03c1k (V) > c\u0304. Therefore,\nX\nt\u0304(V)\nHjk < \u03b8\n\u03c6k (V) +\nj\u2208J(V) : Hjk >0\n\nand it follows that\nt\u0304(V)\n\n\u03c1k (V) = \u03c6k\n\n(V) +\n\nX\n\nX\n\nHjk +\n\nj\u2208J(V) : Hjk >0\n\nHjk < \u03b8 +\n\nj\u2208J(V) : Hjk <0\n\nX\n\nHjk .\n\nj\u2208J(V) : Hjk <0\n\nIf J(V) contains an inhibitory neuron then \u03c1k (V) < \u03b8 \u2212 minj6=i |Hji | = c\u0304, which is a\ncontradiction. Thus J(V) contains only excitatory neurons and i does not belong to\nJ(V). Therefore, the component i of \u03c1(V) satisfies:\nX\nX\nt\u0304(V)\n\u03c1i (V) = \u03c6i (V) +\nHji = (Vi \u2212 \u03b2)e\u2212\u03b3 t\u0304(V) + \u03b2 +\nHji > Vi + min |Hji |.\nj\u2208J(V)\n\nj6=i\n\nj\u2208J(V)\n\nSo, we have proved that if V \u2208 Z1 then \u03c1i (V) > Vi + minj6=i |Hji |.\nIf we suppose now that Zp 6= \u2205 for a p > 1 and if we take V \u2208 Zp , then \u03c1j (V) \u2208 Z1\nfor all j \u2208 {0, . . . , p \u2212 1}. By induction it follows that\n\u03b8 > \u03c1pi (V) = \u03c1i (\u03c1p\u22121 (V)) > \u03c1p\u22121\n(V) + min |Hji |\ni\nj6=i\n\n>\n\n(V)\n\u03c1p\u22122\ni\n\n+ 2 min |Hji | > * * * > Vi + p min |Hji |\n\n20\n\nj6=i\n\nj6=i\n\n\fAs Vi > \u03b1, we have just obtained that \u03b1 + p minj6=i |Hji | < \u03b8 if Zp 6= \u2205. Thus, if\n\u03b1 + p minj6=i |Hji | > \u03b8 the set Zp is empty and \u03c1p (\u03a3) \u2282 Cc\u0304 .\nRemark 3.10. Proposition 3.9 allows to obtain an estimation of the transient time ttrans\nnecessary for all the orbits of the network to enter into the contractive zone \u03a3\u2217 . Let p0 is\nthe smallest integer such that \u03b1+ p0 minj6=i |Hji | > \u03b8, that is p0 := \u2308(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b1)/ minj6=i |Hji |\u2309.\nThen any orbit of the network, with an initial condition in the Poincar\u00e9 section \u03a3, enters\ninto the contractive zone after p0 returns in \u03a3. Now recall that the return time (or the\ninter-spike interval) is the necessary time for the network to enter in the firing regime from\nits initial state V \u2208 \u03a3, that is t\u0304(V). A straightforward computation using the equation\n(6) of the flow, shows that an upper bound of t\u0304(V) for V \u2208 \u03a3 is T := log (\u03b2/(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)).\nTherefore, we deduce the following upper bound for ttrans :\n\u0018\n\u0019\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b8\u2212\u03b1\n\u03b8\nttrans 6 p0 T =\nlog 1 +\n.\nminj6=i |Hji |\n\u03b2\u2212\u03b8\nIt follows that the stronger the interactions are, the shorter is the transient time to enter\ninto the contractive zone. On the other hand, if \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8 is small then the condition (H3) can\npermit very small interactions. In such a case, the upper bound does not prevent from\nvery long transients. Nevertheless, the transient time remains always finite.\nCorollary 3.11. If there exists V \u2208 \u03a3 such that \u03c1p (V) \u2208\n/ \u03a3\u2217 for all p \u2208 N then the\nnetwork contains only excitatory neurons.\nTo close this section about the contraction properties of (the return map of) IF neural\nnetworks we state the following Theorem 3. It proves that if the parameters of a network\nsatisfy the hypothesis (H3) and (H4) then its return map is piecewise contractive in the\nwhole Poincar\u00e9 section.\nTheorem 3. Under the hypothesis (H1), (H2), (H3) and (H4), if at least one neuron is\ninhibitory, then there exists an adapted metric and a partition P \u2032 of the Poincar\u00e9 section\n\u03a3 such that the return map \u03c1 is piecewise contractive in \u03a3 with respect to P \u2032 .\nThe proof of the theorem is given appendix 7.2. It follows from Proposition 3.8 and\nProposition 3.9 which allow to prove that \u03c1 is \"eventually piecewise contractive\" (see\nLemma 7.1 in appendix 7.2). This is a generalization for piecewise continuous maps of the\ndefinition of eventually contractive maps (see for instance Definition 2.6.11 in [16]). Then,\nthe classical arguments to prove the existence of an adapted metric can be reproduced for\npiecewise continuous maps.\nIn the sequel of the paper we will based our study on Proposition 3.8 and Proposition\n3.9. They show that for the region of parameters defined by (H3) and (H4), the Poincar\u00e9\nsection contains two important regions: the contractive zone (\u03a3\u2217 ), which is a forward\ninvariant set of the return map, and the set of the points whose orbit never fall in the\ncontractive zone. This last set can be non-empty only for networks composed exclusively\nof excitatory neurons (cf Corollary 3.11). We study these networks in the Section 4. In the\ncase of the networks containing inhibitory neurons, all the orbits drop into the contractive\n21\n\n\fzone after a finite time (Proposition 3.9). The study of the asymptotic dynamics reduces\nthen to the analysis of the dynamics of the return map in the contractive zone. This is\nthe purpose of Section 5.\n\n4\n\nSynchronization\n\nIn this section we prove the part (1) of Theorem 1 stating sufficient conditions for the\nglobal synchronization of a network.\nDefinition 4.1. We say that an orbit {V(t)}t\u2208R+ is a synchronized orbit of the network,\nif Vi (t) = Vj (t) for all i, j \u2208 I and t \u2208 R+ . We say that the network globally synchronizes,\nif for any initial state V(0) there exists t0 \u2208 R+ such that {W(t) = V(t + t0 )}t\u2208R+ is a\nsynchronized orbit.\nUp to a time translation, a network admits only one synchronized orbits and this orbit\nis periodic. Indeed, suppose a synchronized orbit intersects the Poincar\u00e9 section at a\npoint V \u2208 \u03a3. Since V \u2208 \u03a3, one of its component is equal to zero, and since V belongs\nto a synchronized orbit, all its components are equal. It follows that any synchronized\norbit intersects \u03a3 at the same point, which is the origin 0 of Rn . Moreover, as in the\nsub-threshold regime all the neurons obey to the same the differential equation (2), if\nV = 0, then all the neurons reach the threshold spontaneously at the same time and their\npotential is reset to 0 at the same time. In other word \u03c1(0) = 0 and therefore the orbits\nof 0 is a periodic orbit of the network.\nLatter on, we will call V \u2208 \u03a3 a state of eventual synchronization, if there exists l \u2208 N\nsuch that \u03c1l (V) = 0. Note that a network globally synchronizes if and only if all the\npoints of the Poincar\u00e9 section are states of eventual synchronization.\nTheorem 4. Under hypothesis (H1), if the network is exclusively composed of excitatory\nneurons, that is min Hji > 0, and if the number n of neurons satisfies\nj6=i\n\n\uf8f92\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\u03b8\n\uf8fa\nn>\uf8ef\n\uf8ef min Hji \uf8fa ,\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef j6=i\n\n(26)\n\nwhere \u2308x\u2309 denotes the first integer larger or equal to x, then the network globally synchronizes. Moreover, the transitory time before the global synchronization of the network is\nnot larger than\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u00131\n\u00131\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u03b2\u2212\u03b1\n\u03b8\n\u03b2\n\uf8fa ln\nttrans := ln\n+\uf8ef\n.\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\u03b2 \u2212\u03b8\n\u03b2\u2212\u03b8\n\uf8ef min Hji \uf8fa\nj6=i\n\nIn networks of excitatory neurons, the synchronization state is persistent. That is to\nsay, the network recovers its synchronization in a finite time, if a small perturbation is\napplied to the orbit of the synchronized state 0 \u2208 \u03a3. Precisely, the flow \u03c6t that solves\n22\n\n\fthe differential equation (2) depends continuously on the initial state V for fixed t > 0,\nprovided that in the interval (0, t) no neuron fires. Therefore, there exists \u03b4\u2217 > 0 such\nthat if kV \u2212 0k < \u03b4\u2217 then k\u03c6t (V) \u2212 \u03c6t (0)k < m, where m := min Hji . If i is the first\nj6=i\n\nneuron to reach the threshold potential from the perturbed state V at time t\u0304(V), the\npotential of all the other neurons belongs to (\u03b8 \u2212 m, \u03b8] at this instant. Since the minimum\ninteraction with i is of magnitude m, the firing of i induces the firing of the other neurons.\nThe interactions being instantaneous, the potential of i and of the other neurons are reset\nto 0 simultaneously and \u03c1(V) = 0. The same argument works as well to prove that the\nglobal synchronization is stochastically stable. If a synchronized orbit suffers a stochastic\nperturbation such that, at the instant when a first neuron reaches the threshold, the\npotential of the other neurons is sufficiently near the threshold, then this orbit goes back\nto the Poincar\u00e9 section at the synchronized state.\nProof. of Theorem 4: As the network does not contain inhibitory neurons, a time t+\nfrom which the potential of all the neurons is larger or equal to zero exists. This time is\nsmaller than the necessary time for a neuron, with an initial potential equal to \u03b1, to reach\nthe threshold spontaneously. That is to say,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b2\u2212\u03b1\n1\n,\nt+ 6 ln\n\u03b3\n\u03b2\u2212\u03b8\nrecall (6). Besides, after t+ , it is in the set\n\u03a3+ := {V \u2208 \u03a3 : Vi > 0 \u2200 i \u2208 I}\nthat the orbits of the network intersect the Poincar\u00e9 section. Therefore, to prove the\nglobal synchronization of the network, it is enough to do it for the initial states in \u03a3+ .\nThus, we are going to show that there exists a natural number l such that \u03c1l (V) = 0 for\nall V \u2208 \u03a3+ .\nLet us denote\n\n\u0019\n\u03b8\n,\nm := min Hji > 0 and p :=\nj6=i\nm\nWe state and prove two claims to achieve the proof of the theorem.\n\u0018\n\n(27)\n\nClaim 1: For any initial state V of the network in \u03a3+ , each neuron fires at least once\nbefore the pth return of the orbit of V in \u03a3+ . In brief, the set J p (V) defined by\np\n\nJ (V) :=\n\np\u22121\n[\n\nJ(\u03c1j (V))\n\nj=0\n\nis equal to I for any V \u2208 \u03a3+ .\nLet i \u2208 I. Let us show that if i \u2208\n/ J p\u22121 (V), that is i \u2208\n/ J(\u03c1j (V)) for all j \u2208 {0, . . . , p \u2212 2},\np\u22121\np\u22121\nthen i \u2208 J(\u03c1 (V)). If i \u2208\n/J\n(V), then, by definition of \u03c1, for any j \u2208 {1, . . . , p \u2212 1}\nwe have:\nX\nt\u0304(\u03c1j\u22121 (V)) j\u22121\n\u03c1ji (V) = \u03c6i\n(\u03c1 (V)) +\nHki > \u03c1ij\u22121 (V) + m,\nk\u2208J(\u03c1j\u22121 (V))\n\n23\n\n\ft\u0304(V)\n\nwhere the inequality is obtained using that \u03c6i (V) > Vi for all V \u2208 \u03a3 and i \u2208 I, and\nthe fact that all the interactions are excitatory. By induction it follows that \u03c1p\u22121\n(V) >\ni\nVi + (p \u2212 1)m. We deduce that\nt\u0304(\u03c1p\u22121 (V))\n\n\u03c6i\n\n(\u03c1p\u22121 (V)) +\n\nHki > \u03c1p\u22121\n(V) + m > Vi + pm > pm > \u03b8,\ni\n\nX\n\nk\u2208J(\u03c1p\u22121 (V))\n\nwhich implies that i \u2208 J(\u03c1p\u22121 (V)) and proves the claim.\nClaim 2: For any initial state of the network V \u2208 \u03a3+ , there exists j0 \u2208 {0, . . . , p \u2212 1}\nsuch that the number of neurons that fire simultaneously at time t\u0304(W), where W is the\nj th return of the orbit of V in \u03a3+ , is larger than \u03b8/m. In brief, for all V \u2208 \u03a3+ , there\nexists j0 \u2208 {0, . . . , p \u2212 1} such that #J(\u03c1j0 (V)) > \u03b8/m.\nLet V \u2208 \u03a3+ and j0 be such that #J(\u03c1j0 (V)) > #J(\u03c1j (V)) for all j \u2208 {0, . . . , p \u2212 1}.\nAccording to Claim 1, we have n = #J p (V).

Claim\n2 shows that at some finite instant, the number of neurons that fire simultaneously is at\nleast as large as this quotient. Thus, the firing of these neurons necessarily induces the\nfiring of any other, at the same instant. Indeed, in the mathematical notation, using Claim\n2 we obtain\nt\u0304(\u03c1j0 (V))\n\n\u03c6i\n\n(\u03c1j0 (V)) +\n\nX\n\nHki > \u03c1ji 0 (V) + m\n\nk\u2208J(\u03c1j0 (V))\n\n\u03b8\n> \u03b8,\nm\n\n\u2200i \u2208 I, V \u2208 \u03a3+ .\n\nTherefore, J(\u03c1j0 (V)) = I and \u03c1l (V) = 0 with l = j0 + 1.\nThe global synchronization of the network need at most a time t+ to enters in the set\n\u03a3+ and j0 + 1 6 p iterates of the return map.

This theorem only requires the hypothesis (H1),\nto ensures the obvious fact that no neuron has an infinitely negative potential. As all the\nsynapses are supposed excitatory, the hypothesis (H2) and (H4) are not needed. Likewise,\nthe hypothesis (H3) of the existence of a lower bound \u01eb > 0 for the interactions is not\nrequired. In particular, positive but arbitrarily small interactions may affect the length\nof the transitory regime, but do not prevent the network from globally synchronizing,\nprovided n is sufficiently large. Finally, if the number of neurons does not satisfies (26)\nthe global synchronization may not occur. We illustrate this statement with a simple\nexample involving two neurons and constant interactions.\nProposition 4.2. Let I = {1, 2} and H12 = H21 = H \u2208 (0, \u03b8). The orbit {\u03c1k (V)}k\u2208N of\nthe point\n\u0011\n1 \u0010p 2\nH + 4\u03b2(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8) \u2212 H\nV = (\u03b2 \u2212 x, 0) where x :=\n2\nis not synchronized. It is a period two orbit, the points of which are (\u03b2 \u2212x, 0) and (0, \u03b2 \u2212x).\nProof. A straightforward computation shows that \u03b2 \u2212 x < \u03b8 if and only if H < \u03b8, and\n\u03b2 \u2212 x > 0 if and only if H > \u2212\u03b8. Thus, the condition H \u2208 (0, \u03b8) ensures that V \u2208 \u03a3 and\nnot equal to (0, 0). Now, let us show that \u03c1(V) = (0, \u03b2 \u2212 x). As V1 > 0 = V2 , the neuron\n1 fires spontaneously at time t\u0304(V) = t1 (V) and J0 (V) = {1}. Using (8) with V2 = 0, we\nobtain\n\u03b2(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)\n\u03b2(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)\nt\u0304(V)\n\u03c62 (V) + H = \u03b2 \u2212\n+H =\u03b2\u2212\n+ H = \u03b2 \u2212 x.\n(\u03b2 \u2212 V1 )\nx\nSince \u03b2 \u2212 x < \u03b8, we deduce that the neuron 1 does not induce the firing of the neuron 2,\nand J1 (V) = J0 (V). Thus J(V) = {1}, and\n\u03c11 (V) = 0\n\nand\n\nt\u0304(V)\n\n\u03c12 (V) = \u03c62\n\n(V) + H = \u03b2 \u2212 x,\n\nwhich proves that \u03c1(V) = (0, \u03b2 \u2212 x). Substituting V1 by \u03c12 (V) and V2 by \u03c11 (V) in the\nproof of \u03c1(V) = (0, \u03b2 \u2212 x), we obtain \u03c12 (V) = (\u03b2 \u2212 x, 0) = V\nThe result of Proposition 4.2 can be easily extended to an arbitrary large number of\nneurons. For example, in a network with 2k = n neurons, with equal synaptic weight H/k\nwhere H \u2208 (0, \u03b8), any initial state such that half of the neurons have their potential equal\nto (\u03b2 \u2212 x), and the other half have their potential equal to 0, is a periodic point of period\n2.\nWhen Hypothesis (H3) is assumed, and thus the interactions are bounded bellow by a\npositive number (which tends to zero when (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8) tends to zero), the global synchronization is not sure, since the hypothesis of Proposition 4.2 can be satisfied as well. However,\naccording to Lemma 3.7, there is always some initial states for which the network synchornizes.\nProposition 4.3. Under Hypothesis (H1) and (H3), if the network is exclusively composed\nof excitatory neurons, and if its orbit visits the contractive zone \u03a3\u2217 , then the network\nsynchronizes, independently of its size.\n25\n\n\fProof. Suppose the orbit of the network visits \u03a3\u2217 at a point V. Since \u03a3\u2217 \u2282 Cc\u0304 and I\nis only composed of excitatory neurons, the hypothesis of Lemma 3.7 are satisfied. We\ndeduce that J(V) = I, and so \u03c1(V) = 0.\nNow, if the network has also inhibitory neurons, any orbit visits \u03a3\u2217 after a finite\ntransitory regime, see Proposition 3.9. Therefore, if the network does not synchronizes, it\nis because the excitatory neurons stop to fire after a finite time. We prove rigorously this\nresults in what follows.\nDefinition 4.4. We say that V \u2208 \u03a3 is a state of eventual death of the neuron i, if there\nexists p \u2208 N such that i \u2208\n/ J(\u03c1j (V)) for all j > p.\nIn other words, a state of eventual death of a neuron is a state such that the neuron\nstops to emit spikes after a certain time. Therefore, we define a state of the (continuous\ntime) model of eventual death as a state whose orbit intersects the Poincar\u00e9 section in a\nstate of eventual death.\nProposition 4.5. Under the hypothesis (H1), (H2), (H3) and (H4), if the network is\ncomposed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, then the states of the network are either\nstates of eventual synchronization or states of eventual death of all the excitatory neurons.\nProof. Let i be an excitatory neuron and V \u2208 \u03a3. By Proposition 3.9 we can assume\nV \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 without loss of generality. We have, either i \u2208\n/ J(\u03c1j (V)) for all j \u2208 N or there\nj\nexists j \u2208 N such that i \u2208 J(\u03c1 (V)). In the first case V is a state of eventual death\nof the neuron i. In the second case, by Proposition 3.8 it follows \u03c1j (V) \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 for all\nj \u2208 N, and then we can apply Lemma 3.7 to deduce that J(\u03c1j (V)) = I. This implies\n\u03c1j+1 (V) = 0.\n\n5\n\nAsymptotic dynamics of networks with inhibitory neurons\n\nIn the previous section we studied the dynamics of networks composed exclusively of\nexcitatory neurons. Now we focus on networks containing at least one inhibitory neuron.\nAlong this section, we assume Hypothesis (H1), (H2), (H3) and (H4) on the parameter\nvalues, and that the set I \u2212 of inhibitory neurons is non empty.\nSection 5.1 is a preliminary section where a more precise characterization of the return\nmap in the contractive zone \u03a3\u2217 is given. We study its continuity pieces and show that it\nsatisfies a general definition of piecewise contracting maps. In Section 5.2, we introduce\nthe concepts of stable set and sensitive set. Then, in Section 5.3 we give and we comment\nthe principal results about the asymptotic dynamics of the return map in both of these\nsets. It contains in particular Theorem 5, which is a more detailed version of the part 2)\nof Theorem 1, about the dynamics in the stable set. Finally, the ending Section 5.4 is the\nproof of a proposition contained in Section 5.3.\n26\n\n\f5.1\n\nContinuity pieces of the return map in the contractive zone \u03a3\u2217 .\n\nIn Proposition 3.9 we have shown that any orbit of a network containing inhibitory neurons\nfinally drops into the forward invariant contractive zone \u03a3\u2217 . Then, it is not restrictive to\nconsider this space as our new phase space5 . In Section 2.2, we introduced the partition\nP of the Poincar\u00e9 section defined by (12). When restricting our the phase space to \u03a3\u2217 ,\nthis partition becomes\nP \u2217 := {\u03a3\u2217J }J\u2208P (I)\n\n\u03a3\u2217J := \u03a3J \u2229 \u03a3\u2217\n\nwhere\n\n\u2200 J \u2208 P (I).\n\nAs before, if the initial state of the network is V \u2208 \u03a3\u2217J , then, when the network enters in\nthe firing regime at time t\u0304(V), the neurons that fire are exactly those of the set J. As\na starting point to the study of the asymptotic dynamics of neural networks containing\ninhibitory neurons, we give here a detailed description of the partition P \u2217 . It will allow\nto show that the return map satisfies a general definition of piecewise contractive map.\nFirst of all, some atoms of P \u2217 are empty. Indeed, by Lemma 3.7, if J contains excitatory\nneurons and J 6= I, then \u03a3\u2217J = \u2205. As a consequence, the possibly nonempty sets of P \u2217 are:\nthe set \u03a3\u2217I of the initial states such that in the firing regime all the neurons fires, and the\nsets \u03a3\u2217J of the initial states such that in the firing regime only some inhibitory neurons\nfire. It follows that\n[\n[\n\u03a3\u2217 =\n\u03a3\u2217I ,\n\u03a3\u2217J\nJ\u2208P (I \u2212 )\n\nwhere I \u2212 \u2282 I is the set of the inhibitory neurons and P (I \u2212 ) denotes the set of all the\nnonempty subsets of I \u2212 .\nEach set \u03a3\u2217J admits an explicit formulation which is useful to study the topological\nproperties of P \u2217 .\n\nLet J \u2208 P (I \u2212 ) and suppose the initial state of the network is V \u2208 \u03a3\u2217J . Since the firing\nof an inhibitory neuron cannot lead another neuron to fire, if all the neurons of J fire,\nit is because they all reach the threshold spontaneously at the same time t\u0304(V). In other\nwords, ti (V) = t\u0304(V) for all i \u2208 J and tk (V) > t\u0304(V) for all k \u2208\n/ J. The initial potential\nof all the neurons of J is thus the same and it is larger than the potential of the other\nneurons. So, we can conclude that\n\u03a3\u2217J = {V \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 : Vi = Vj > Vk\n\n\u2200 i, j \u2208 J and \u2200 k \u2208\n/ J}\n\n\u2200 J \u2208 P (I \u2212 ).\n\n(28)\n\nNow let J = I and and suppose the initial state of the network is V \u2208 \u03a3\u2217I . Then,\neither all the neurons reach spontaneously the threshold at the same time, or at least one\nexcitatory neuron reaches the threshold before the others and induces the firing of all the\nothers by avalanche. In both cases ti (V) = t\u0304(V) for some i in the set I + of the excitatory\nneurons. So, we can conclude that\n\u03a3\u2217I = {V \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 : max Vi > Vk\ni\u2208I +\n\n5\n\nFrom now on, \u03c1 will denote the return map restricted to \u03a3c .\n\n27\n\n\u2200 k \u2208 I}.\n\n(29)\n\n\fLet us study the topological properties of the sets \u03a3\u2217J . We consider the relative topology\ninduced by Rn in \u03a3.\nIn the case where J contains only one neuron, then it is an inhibitory neuron, and\naccording to (28)\n\u03a3\u2217{i} = {V \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 : Vi > Vk\n\n\u2200 k 6= i}\n\n\u2200 i \u2208 I \u2212.\n\nA set \u03a3\u2217{i} is open, and its topological boundary, that we denote \u2202\u03a3\u2217{i} , is the set\n\u2202\u03a3\u2217{i} = {V \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 : Vi > Vk\n\n\u2200k \u2208 I\n\nand \u2203 k 6= i : Vi = Vk }.\n\n(30)\n\nSuppose now that J \u2282 P (I \u2212 ) contains two or more neurons, and let V \u2208 \u03a3\u2217J . From\n(28) it follows that Vi > Vk for all i \u2208 J and k \u2208 I, and Vi = Vj for all i, j \u2208 J. Therefore,\nV belongs to the intersection of the boundary of the sets \u03a3\u2217{i} such that i \u2208 J. We deduce\nthat\n[\n\u03a3\u2217J \u2282\n\u2202\u03a3\u2217{i} \u2200J \u2282 P (I \u2212 ) such that #J > 2.\n(31)\ni\u2208J\n\n\u25e6\n\nFinally, let us study the set \u03a3\u2217I . According to (29), its interior \u03a3\u2217I is\n\u25e6\n\n\u03a3\u2217I = {V \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 : max Vi > Vk\ni\u2208I +\n\n\u2200 k \u2208 I},\n\nand its boundary is the subset of \u03a3\u2217I defined by\n\u2202\u03a3\u2217I = {V \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 : max Vi > Vk\ni\u2208I +\n\n\u2200k \u2208 I\n\nand\n\n\u2203 j \u2208 I \u2212 : Vj = max Vi }.\ni\u2208I +\n\n(32)\n\nIf V \u2208 \u2202\u03a3\u2217I , then there exists j \u2208 I \u2212 such that Vj > Vk for all k \u2208 I, with equality for a\nk \u2208 I + and thus different of j. In other words V \u2208 \u2202\u03a3\u2217{j} for a j \u2208 I \u2212 . It follows that\n\u2202\u03a3\u2217I \u2282\n\n[\n\n\u2202\u03a3\u2217{i} .\n\ni\u2208I \u2212\n\nTo sum up, the previous analysis shows that \u03a3\u2217 can be decomposed as the union of\npairwise disjoint sets: the open sets \u03a3\u2217{i} (one for each inhibitory neuron i \u2208 I \u2212 ),\nthe interior of \u03a3\u2217I , and the closed set with empty interior \u2202P \u2217 . This last set is the union of\n\u2202\u03a3\u2217I with the sets \u03a3\u2217J such that J contains only inhibitory neurons and #J > 2. Moreover,\nit coincides with the union of the topological boundaries of the open sets \u03a3\u2217{i} . So, we\nhave\n[\n[\n[ \u25e6 [\n\u2202P \u2217\nwhere\n\u2202P \u2217 :=\n\u03a3\u2217 =\n\u2202\u03a3\u2217{i} .\n(33)\n\u03a3\u2217{i} \u03a3\u2217I\n#I \u2212 + 2\n\ni\u2208I \u2212\n\ni\u2208I \u2212\n\nEach set of the type\n\n\u03a3\u2217{i}\n\nconsists of the initial states of the network for which, in the\n\u25e6\n\nfiring regime, only the inhibitory neuron i fires. The set \u03a3\u2217I are the initial states of\nthe networks for which only excitatory neurons (one or several) reach spontaneously the\nthreshold. According to Lemma 3.7, the firing of these excitatory neurons induces the\n28\n\n\fsynchronization of the network. Finally, for the initial states V \u2208 \u2202P \u2217 , at least two\nneurons reach the threshold spontaneously and at least one is inhibitory. If they are all\ninhibitory, then only these neurons fire (it corresponds to the case where V \u2208 \u03a3\u2217J , with\n#J > 1), but if one of them is excitatory, its firing induces the synchronization of the\nnetwork (it corresponds to the case where V \u2208 \u2202\u03a3\u2217I ).\n\u25e6\n\nThe return map is continuous in \u03a3\u2217I and in any \u03a3\u2217{i} , because each of these sets is\nopen, and contained in the interior of a set \u03a3J where \u03c1 is continuous (see (13)). So, the\nboundary set \u2202P \u2217 contains all the discontinuity points of the return map. Let us give an\nintuitive idea explaining why those discontinuities appear. For an initial state V \u2208 \u2202P \u2217\nat least two neurons fire in the firing regime, say i \u2208 I \u2212 and j \u2208 I. But, there exists an\narbitrarily small perturbation W of V that belongs to \u03a3\u2217{i} , i.e. such that only the neuron\ni fires in the firing regime. This implies the existence of a gap between \u03c1(V) and \u03c1(W),\nsince \u03c1j (V) = 0 and \u03c1j (W) 6= 0, except for a very specifics value of Hij . The following\nlemma makes rigorous this intuitive idea.\nLemma 5.1. If V \u2208 \u2202P \u2217 , then there exists a sequence {Um }m\u2208N of points of \u03a3\u2217 such\nthat lim Um = V and lim k\u03c1(Um ) \u2212 \u03c1(V)k > \u03bc where\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nm\u2192\u221e\n\n\u03bc := min{|\u03b1|, min |Hij + \u03b8|}.\ni6=j\n\n(34)\n\nProof. Let V \u2208 \u2202P \u2217 and i \u2208 I \u2212 such that V \u2208 \u2202\u03a3\u2217{i} . By definition of boundary, there is\na sequence {Um }m\u2208N of points of \u03a3\u2217{i} such that lim Um = V. For all k 6= i, we have\nm\u2192\u221e\n\n(\u03b2 \u2212 Ukm )(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)\n+ Hik }\nm\u2192\u221e\n\u03b2 \u2212 Uim\n(\u03b2 \u2212 Vk )(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)\n+ Hik }.\n= max{\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2212\n\u03b2 \u2212 Vi\n\nlim \u03c1k (Um ) =\n\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nlim max{\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2212\n\nOn the other hand, if V \u2208 \u2202\u03a3\u2217{i} , it belongs to a set \u03a3\u2217J such that i \u2208 J and #J > 2\n(possibly J = I). Therefore, there is j 6= i in J such that Vi = Vj and it follows that\nlim \u03c1j (Um ) = max{\u03b1, Hij + \u03b8}. As j \u2208 J and V \u2208 \u03a3\u2217J , we have \u03c1j (V) = 0, and we\nm\u2192\u221e\nobtain that\nlim k\u03c1(V) \u2212 \u03c1(Um )k > lim |\u03c1j (V) \u2212 \u03c1j (Um )| = | max{\u03b1, Hij + \u03b8}|\n\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nwhich leads to the desired inequality.\nTo conclude this section we give a general definition of a piecewise contractive map\nand we show that the return map fulfill this definition.\nDefinition 5.2. (Piecewise contractive map) A map \u03c1, from a compact set \u03a3\u2217 \u2282 Rn to\nitself, is said to be piecewise contractive if it satisfies the following three conditions:\n29\n\n\f1) There exists a finite family \u03a3\u2217{0} , \u03a3\u2217{1} , . . . , \u03a3\u2217{p} of pairwise disjoint open sets such that\n\u2217\n\n\u03a3 =\n\np\n[\n\n\u03a3\u2217{i} .\n\ni=0\n\n2) There exists a constant \u03bb < 1 such that for all i \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , p}\nk\u03c1(V) \u2212 \u03c1(W)k 6 \u03bbkV \u2212 Wk\n\n\u2200 V, W \u2208 \u03a3\u2217{i} .\n\n3) The map \u03c1 has a discontinuity jump larger than a constant \u03bc > 0 in the borders \u2202\u03a3\u2217{i}\nof a the sets \u03a3\u2217{i} .\nUnder the hypothesis (H1), (H2), (H3) and (H4), and the additional generic hypothesis\nmin |Hij + \u03b8| =\n6 0,\ni6=j\n\nwhich stipulates that the smallest inhibitory interaction is different from \u2212\u03b8, the return\nmap of the network is piecewise contractive.\nFirst, by Proposition 3.8, the set \u03a3\u2217 is compact and \u03c1(\u03a3\u2217 ) \u2282 \u03a3\u2217 . Second, if we denote\n\u03a3\u2217{0} the interior of \u03a3\u2217I and p the number of inhibitory neurons, the decomposition (33) of\n\u03a3\u2217 shows that the condition 1) is satisfied. Third, the condition 2) is also satisfied because\n\u03a3\u2217 is a contractive zone with respect to the partition P, and thus it is also a contractive\nzone with respect to the partition P \u2217 . Finally, the Lemma 5.1 shows that 3) is true for\n\u03bc := min{|\u03b1|, min |Hij + \u03b8|}, since \u03b1 < 0 by Hypothesis (H1) and min |Hij + \u03b8| =\n6 0.\ni6=j\n\ni6=j\n\nThe results of the sequel of this section apply to any abstract piecewise contractive\nmap satisfying Definition 5.2. So, they apply in particular to the return map under the\nhypothesis mentioned above. To simplify the notations, and to fit with those of Definition\n5.2, we will denote \u03a3\u2217{0} the interior of \u03a3\u2217I . It does not mean that a new neuron 0 is\nintroduced in the network, it rather recall that if V \u2208 \u03a3\u2217{0} then \u03c1(V) = 0. Also, I0 will\ndenote the set {0, 1, . . . , #I \u2212 }.\n\n5.2\n\nThe stable and the sensitive sets.\n\nIn order to study the asymptotic dynamics of the return map, we divide the contractive\nzone \u03a3\u2217 in two complementary sets: the stable set S and the sensitive set C = \u03a3\u2217 \\ S.\nDefinition 5.3. (Stable set) A point V \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 is stable, if for all \u03bd > 0 there exists \u03b4 > 0\nsuch that for all p \u2208 N:\nif\n\nk\u03c1p (V) \u2212 Wk < \u03b4\n\nthen\n\nk\u03c1k (\u03c1p (V)) \u2212 \u03c1k (W)k < \u03bd\n\nWe call stable set and denote S the set of all the stable points.\n30\n\n\u2200 k > 1.\n\n(35)\n\n\fIf V is a stable point, then any sufficiently small perturbation of V, or of a point of\nits orbit, has an orbit which remains near the orbit of V. For instance, if the initial state\nof a network is stable, one can expect that a small perturbation may modify slightly and\ntemporary the inter-spike intervals, but would not change the firing neurons.\nDefinition 5.4. (Sensitive set) A point V \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 is sensitive, if there exists \u03bd > 0 such\nthat for all \u03b4 > 0 there are p \u2208 N and W \u2208 \u03a3c satisfying:\nk\u03c1p (V) \u2212 Wk < \u03b4\n\nand\n\nk\u03c1k (\u03c1p (V)) \u2212 \u03c1k (W)k > \u03bd\n\nfor some\n\nk > 1.\n\nWe call sensitive set and denote C, the set of all the sensitive points.\nThe sensitive set is the set of the points that are not stable. For a network in a sensitive\nstate, there exit arbitrarily small perturbations that produce a consequent change of its\ntime evolution. Typically, such perturbations modify the firing neurons at an instant of\nits evolution.\nLemma 5.5. The stable set S is forward invariant, i.e \u03c1(S) \u2282 S, and the sensitive set C\nis backward invariant, i.e \u03c1\u22121 (C) \u2282 C.\nProof. Let us prove that \u03c1(S) \u2282 S. Take V \u2208 S. Then for all \u03bd > 0 there exists \u03b4 > 0\nsuch that for all p > 1\nif\n\nk\u03c1p\u22121 (\u03c1(V)) \u2212 Wk < \u03b4\n\nthen\n\nk\u03c1k (\u03c1p\u22121 (\u03c1(V))) \u2212 \u03c1k (W)k 6 \u03bd\n\n\u2200k > 1.\n\nThe last assertion is the definition of stable point applied to \u03c1(V). Therefore \u03c1(S) \u2282 S.\nAs C is the complement in \u03a3\u2217 of S, and \u03c1(S) \u2282 S we have \u03c1\u22121 (C) \u2282 C.\nLemma 5.5 proves that if a network is initially in a stable state then it is forever stable.\nIf it is in a sensitive state, its past states are sensitive, but its future states can be stable.\nNow, we give a useful characterization of the stable set:\nLemma 5.6. Let us denote d the distance induced by the norm k * k, that is d(V, W) =\nkV \u2212 Wk for all V and W in \u03a3\u2217 . For all \u03b7 > 0, let S\u03b7 be the set of the stable points\nwhose orbit is at a distance larger than \u03b7 of \u2202P \u2217 :\nS\u03b7 := {V \u2208 S : d(\u03c1p (V), \u2202P \u2217 ) > \u03b7\n\n\u2200 p \u2208 N}\n\n\u2200\u03b7 > 0\n\nthen,\nS=\n\n[\n\nS\u03b7 .\n\n(36)\n\n\u03b7>0\n\nProof. By definition, S\u03b7 \u2282 S for any \u03b7 > 0. Now, let V \u2208 S and suppose by contradiction\nthat V \u2208\n/ S\u03b7 for all \u03b7 > 0. Let \u03b4 > 0 and \u03bc be the discontinuity jump of \u03c1 in \u2202P \u2217 defined\nin (34). As V is a stable point, there exits 0 < \u03b40 < \u03b4 such that for all p \u2208 N\nif\n\nk\u03c1p (V) \u2212 Uk < \u03b40\n\nthen k\u03c1(\u03c1p (V)) \u2212 \u03c1(U)k <\n31\n\n\u03bc\n.\n4\n\n\fAs V \u2208\n/ S\u03b40 /2 , there exist p0 and W \u2208 \u2202P \u2217 such that\nk\u03c1p0 (V) \u2212 Wk <\n\n\u03b40\n< \u03b4.\n2\n\nBy Lemma 5.1, there exist U \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 such that\nkW \u2212 Uk <\n\n\u03b40\n2\n\nand k\u03c1(W) \u2212 \u03c1(U)k >\n\n\u03bc\n.\n2\n\nFor this U, we have k\u03c1p0 (V) \u2212 Uk 6 k\u03c1p0 (V) \u2212 Wk + kW \u2212 Uk < \u03b40 . Thus,\nk\u03c1(\u03c1p0 (V)) \u2212 \u03c1(W)k > |k\u03c1(W) \u2212 \u03c1(U)k \u2212 k\u03c1(\u03c1p0 (V)) \u2212 \u03c1(U)k| >\n\n\u03bc\n\u03bc \u03bc\n\u2212\n= .\n2\n4\n4\n\nTo sum up, we have shown the existence of a \u03bd := \u03bc/4 such that for an arbitrary \u03b4 > 0,\nthere exists p0 and W such that\nk\u03c1p0 (V) \u2212 Wk < \u03b4\n\nand\n\nk\u03c1(\u03c1p0 (V)) \u2212 \u03c1(W)k > \u03bd.\n\nIt follows that V belongs to the sensitive set, which is a contradiction. We conclude that\nfor all V \u2208 S there exists \u03b7 > 0 such that V \u2208 S\u03b7 .\nNote that each set S\u03b7 is forward invariant and does not contain point of \u2202P \u2217 . In other\nwords,\n[\n\u03a3\u2217{i} \u2200 \u03b7 > 0.\n(37)\n\u03c1(S\u03b7 ) \u2282 S\u03b7 and S\u03b7 \u2282\ni\u2208I0\n\nand by (36) the same relations are true for S. It follows in particular that \u03c1 is continuous\nin any S\u03b7 and in S. Also \u2202P \u2217 is a subset of the sensitive set. The relations (37) show\nthat if the initial state of the network is stable, then either it get synchronized, if its\norbit visit \u03a3\u2217{0} , or only inhibitory neurons fire and never at the same time. The situation\nwhere various inhibitory neurons fire simultaneously occurs only when the network is in a\nsensitive state.\n\n5.3\n\nPrincipal results on the asymptotic dynamics\n\nIn this subsection we prove Theorem 5 which states that the limit sets attracting the\nstable points is only composed of limit cycles. The number of limits cycle can be finite or\ninfinite, but it is always countable. The proof essentially relies on the contraction property\nof the return map. Since the map is not continuous, it is not possible to apply directly\na classic fixed point theorem for contractive maps. Nevertheless, we give a generalization\nof the Banach fixed point theorem for piecewise contractive maps. It states the existence\nof periodic orbits - maybe of periods different from one and not necessarily unique - that\nattract all the stable points.\nDefinition 5.7. (\u03c9-limit set) The \u03c9-limit set \u03c9(V) of a point V \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 is the set of the\nlimit points of the future orbit of V, that is:\n\u03c9(V) = {W \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 : \u2203 {pk }k\u2208N : lim pk = +\u221e and lim \u03c1pk (V) = W}.\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n32\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n\fFor a set A \u2282 \u03a3\u2217 , we denote \u03c9(A) the union of all the \u03c9- limit sets of the points of A.\nThat is,\n[\n\u03c9(A) :=\n\u03c9(V).\nV\u2208A\n\nIn other words, W belongs to the \u03c9-limit set of V if there exists a subsequence of the\norbit of V which converges to W. As the phase space \u03a3\u2217 is compact, the \u03c9-limit set of\nany point is nonempty. Intuitively, the \u03c9-limit set of V is the set of the points of \u03a3\u2217 for\nwhich there exists an arbitrarily small neighborhood which is always visited by the orbit\nof V. In this sense, the points of \u03c9(V) are those which attract the orbit of V. The set\n\u03c9(V) is forward invariant if \u03c1 is continuous in \u03c9(V), which is not necessarily the case for\nany V. Nevertheless, the \u03c9-limit set is the same for all the points of a same orbit.\nDefinition 5.8. (Limit cycle) A set L \u2282 \u03a3\u2217 is a limit cycle, if it is a periodic orbit whose\nbasin of attraction\nB(L) = {W \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 : \u03c9(W) = L}\ncontains an open neighborhood of L.\nNow we state the two important results of this section:\nProposition 5.9. For any \u03b7 > 0 such that S\u03b7 6= \u2205, the set S\u03b7 contains only a finite\nnumber N (\u03b7) of limit cycles, and any point of S\u03b7 belongs to the basin of attraction of one\nof these limit cycles. In other words, for all \u03b7 > 0\nN (\u03b7)\n\n[\n\n\u03c9(S\u03b7 ) =\n\nLi ,\n\ni=1\n\nwhere each set Li is a limit cycle included in S\u03b7 .\nWe postpone the proof of the proposition to Section 5.4. This proposition allow us\nto deduce the following theorem which is a more detailed statement of the part 2) of\nTheorem 1. As well as Proposition 5.9, this theorem is true for any piecewise contractive\nmap satisfying Definition 5.2.\nTheorem 5. If S 6= \u2205, any stable point belongs to the basin of attraction of a limit cycle\ncontained in the stable set. The number of these limit cycles is countable. In other words,\n\u03c9(S) =\n\nN\n[\n\nLi ,\n\ni=1\n\nwhere each set Li is a limit cycle included in S. Moreover, the number N of limit cycles\nis finite if d(\u03c9(S), \u2202P) > 0 and it is infinite, but countable, if d(\u03c9(S), \u2202P) = 0.\nProof. By Lemma 5.6 any stable point V belongs to a S\u03b7 for some \u03b7 > 0. Therefore, by\nProposition 5.9, it belongs to the basin of attraction of a limit cycle in S\u03b7 \u2282 S, that is\n33\n\n\f\u03c9(V) is a limit cycle contained in S. As for all \u03b7 \u2032 > \u03b7 we have S\u03b7\u2032 \u2282 S\u03b7 we can rewrite\n(36) as\n[\nS=\nS l where l := max\u2217 d(V, \u2202P \u2217 ).\nk\u2208N\n\nV\u2208\u03a3\n\nk\n\nSince for each k \u2208 N the set \u03c9(Sl/k ) is a finite union of limit cycles and S is a countable\nunion of the sets Sl/k , it follows that \u03c9(S) is a countable union of limit cycles.\nIf d(\u03c9(S), \u2202P \u2217 ) > 0, then there exists \u03b7 > 0 such that d(\u03c9(S), \u2202P \u2217 ) > \u03b7. Since the\npoints of \u03c9(S) are stable, the return map is continuous in \u03c9(S) and therefore \u03c9(S) is\ninvariant. It follows that the orbit of any point of \u03c9(S) remains at a distance larger than\n\u03b7 of \u2202P \u2217 . In other words, \u03c9(S) \u2282 S\u03b7 . By Proposition 5.9 it implies that \u03c9(\u03c9(S)) is a finite\nunion of limit cycles. But as \u03c9(S) contains only periodic points we have \u03c9(\u03c9(S)) = \u03c9(S).\nThis show that if d(\u03c9(S), \u2202P \u2217 ) > 0 then \u03c9(S) is a finite union of limit cycle.\nNow suppose d(\u03c9(S), \u2202P \u2217 ) = 0. Then, either \u03c9(S) \u2229 \u2202P \u2217 6= \u2205, or there exits an infinite\nsequence of different points of \u03c9(S) which converges to a point of \u2202P \u2217 . The first option is\nimpossible since \u03c9(S) \u2282 S and \u2202P \u2217 is a subset of the sensitive set. Therefore, the second\noption holds and \u03c9(S) is infinite. This ends the proof, since in the other hand, we know\nthat is it countable.\nNow we detail the consequences of the previous results on the dynamics of IF neural\nnetworks.\nTheorem 5 states that if the initial state V of a network is stable (i.e. V \u2208 S) then,\nwhen time tends to infinity, the network tends to fire periodically, since it is attracted by\na limit cycle. If an excitatory neurons fires, this limit cycle is a synchronized orbit. But\nif no excitatory neuron fires, then the asymptotic firing patterns of each neuron present a\ncommon period but they are not synchronized (recall (37), two inhibitory neurons cannot\nfire at the same time). According to the initial stable state of the network, the attracting\nlimit cycle can change. The stable set contains only a countable number of limit cycles\nand certainly, for most values of the parameters, this number is finite. However, it can\nalso be infinite.\nThe situation described above does not prevent the stable dynamics of the network\nfrom exhibiting a behavior which seems chaotic, in a wide sense of the term. By definition\nof the stable set, any sufficiently small perturbation is damped and does not modify the\nasymptotic periodic pattern of the network. Nevertheless, the size of such perturbation\ndepends on the set S\u03b7 to which the initial state of the network belongs. If \u03b7 is large, then\nlarge perturbations are allowed. But if \u03b7 is small, then the orbit of V can get near to the\ndiscontinuity set \u2202P \u2217 , or more generally, near to a sensitive point. in such a case some\nsmall perturbations (but non arbitrarily small) can change significantly the behavior of the\nnetwork. The most probable effect is a change of the limit cycle attracting the network.\nAlso, the network enters into a transitory regime before reaching this new limit cycle.\nMoreover, the transitory time before the network gets near to a limit cycle and the\nperiod of this limit cycle cannot decrease when \u03b7 decreases (see Remark 5.12). In other\nwords, the initial stable states whose orbits get the closer to the sensitive points have\n34\n\n\fthe larger transitory times. Besides, the limit cycles attracting them have the largest\nperiods. It follows that those limit cycles may never be observed during a finite time of\nexperimentation, since the network is in a transient regime and/or it tends to a limit cycle\nof very large period. This phenomenon most probably occurs if the distance between \u03c9(S)\nand \u2202P \u2217 is equal to zero. In such a case \u03c9(S) contains an infinite number of limit cycles,\nand for any given number \u03b4 > 0, there is an infinity of limit cycles at a distance smaller\nthan \u03b4 of \u2202P \u2217 . Thus, most of the initial states of the network have an orbit which is\nattracted by one of these limit cycles of large period. Furthermore, if a small perturbation\nis applied repeatedly to one of these orbits, for example by rounding errors in numerical\nsimulations or in the presence of noise, it can maintain the orbit in the same region, but\nchange many times the limit cycles it is attracted by.\nTheorem 5 and Proposition 5.9 are results about the asymptotic dynamics of the stable\nset. However, Lemma 5.6 allows us to make some comments about the dynamics of the\ncomplementary set, namely the sensitive set. This lemma proves that any stable point\nbelongs to a set S\u03b7 for some \u03b7 > 0. Therefore, all the points of the orbit of a stable point\nV are at a distance larger than \u03b7(V) > 0 of \u2202P \u2217 . It follows that the sensitive set consists\nof the points whoseSorbit is arbitrarily near to \u2202P \u2217 . These points are those of \u2202P \u2217 and of\n\u03c1\u2212k (\u2202P \u2217 ), as well as the points whose \u03c9-limit set contains a point\nall its pre-images\nk\u2208N\n\nof \u2202P \u2217 . Formally,\n[\n[\nC=\n\u03c1\u2212k (\u2202P \u2217 ) C\nk\u2208N\n\nwhere C := {V \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 : \u03c9(V) \u2229 \u2202P \u2217 6= \u2205}.\n\nThe points of C that are not in C have an orbit which is eventually stable and Theorem\n5 applies for them after a transitory time. The set C is invariant, and for any initial state\nV in this set, there exit arbitrarily small perturbations that produce a large deviation\nin its orbit. The invariance of C and its sensitivity to arbitrary small perturbations are\ningredients of the concept of chaos. However, they are not enough to ensure the presence\nof chaos from a strict mathematical point of view. In particular, the existence of piecewise\ncontractive maps exhibiting chaotic attractors is a widely open question. Also, the exact\nnature of the possible attractors of C has been few documented. We can nevertheless\nmention [8], where this question is investigated for piecewise affine contractive maps. In\nthis paper, it is shown that the attractor of C can have any type of cardinality (finite,\ncountable infinite and uncountable). In particular, the most complex found attractor is a\ntransitive union of a Cantor set and an infinite countable set, which does not contain any\nperiodic orbit.\nFrom the results of this section, it follows that the piecewise contractive character of\nthe return map leads the stable dynamics to be asymptotically periodic. However, it does\nprevent the network from exhibiting a dynamics that can seem chaotic when observed at\nfinite time scales. The richness of this dynamics depends on the interrelations between\nthe stable set and the chaotic set. If the asymptotic sets of the stable dynamics remain\nfar from the discontinuities of the return map, then numerical simulations should observe\na stable periodic behavior. But, in the other case, this periodic behavior may be not\nobserved at finite time scales and/or in presence of perturbations, for an important set of\n35\n\n\finitial states of the network. Also, non periodic attractors exist in the sensitive set and\ncan coexist with the periodic attractors of the stable set.\n\n5.4\n\nProof of Proposition 5.9\n\nTo prove Proposition 5.9 we introduce the so-called atoms of a set S\u03b7 .

The number of iteration k of the return map that ensure that any atom\nof generation k of S\u03b7 is included in a continuity piece of the return map depends on \u03b7.\nThis number is an upper bound on the transitory time for all the orbits of S\u03b7 to enter in\nthe attraction basin of a limit cycle and on the period of this cycle. When \u03b7 increases this\nupper bound decreases. The largest transitory times and the largest period are therefore\nthose of the points of the sets S\u03b7 with the smallest \u03b7.\nLemma 5.13.

Then, by the fixed point theorem of Banach, there\nexists a unique periodic point \u1e7c of period p in B 0 .\nWe prove now that if V \u2208 Bk , then \u03c9(V) is the orbit L of \u1e7c. Without loss of generality\nwe can assume V \u2208 B0 . It is enough to show that \u03c9(V) = \u03c9(\u1e7c), since the \u03c9-limit set of\na periodic point coincides with its orbit.\n37\n\n\fLet {pj }j\u2208N be a sequence of natural numbers such that lim pj = +\u221e and such that\nj\u2192\u221e\n\neither lim\n\n\u03c1pj (V)\n\nj\u2192\u221e\n\u03c1pj (V)\n\nor lim\n\nj\u2192\u221e\n\n\u03c1pj (\u1e7c)\n\nexists. Since V and \u1e7c belong both to B 0 , according\n\nto ii)\nand \u03c1pj (\u1e7c) belong to the same continuity piece for all j \u2208 N. Using the\ncontraction property we obtain:\nlim k\u03c1pj (V) \u2212 \u03c1pj (\u1e7c)k 6 lim \u03bbpj kV \u2212 \u1e7ck = 0.\n\nj\u2192\u221e\n\nj\u2192\u221e\n\nIt follows that both lim \u03c1pj (V) and lim \u03c1pj (\u1e7c) exist and are equal. This proves that\nj\u2192\u221e\n\nj\u2192\u221e\n\n\u03c9(V) = \u03c9(\u1e7c) as wanted.\n\n\u2737\n\nProof of Proposition 5.9: Step 1 Let k\u0303 \u2208 N be such that the thesis of Lemma 5.11 is true.\nWe show that the image by \u03c1 of any atom of Ak\u0303 is contained in an atom of Ak\u0303 . Suppose\nA \u2208 Ak\u0303 . By Lemma 5.11, there exists i \u2208 I0 such that A \u2282 \u03a3\u2217{i} , and since any atom\nis contained in S\u03b7 , we have \u03c1(A) = \u03c1(A \u2229 \u03a3\u2217{i} \u2229 S\u03b7 ) = Fi (A). Then, \u03c1(A) \u2208 Ak\u0303+1 , and\naccording to ii) of Lemma 5.10 it is included in an atom of Ak\u0303 .\n\nStep 2 Let V \u2208 S\u03b7 and W = \u03c1k\u0303 (V). Then, from i) and ii) of Lemma 5.10 we deduce\nthat each point of the orbit of W belongs to an atom of Ak\u0303 . Being the number of atoms\nin Ak\u0303 finite, it must exist B0 \u2208 Ak\u0303 such that \u03c1j0 (W) \u2208 B0 and \u03c1j0 +p (W) \u2208 B0 for some\nj0 and p \u2208 N. Let's denote B1 , B2 , . . . , Bp\u22121 the atoms of Ak\u0303 that contain respectively\n\u03c1j0 +1 (W), \u03c1j0 +2 (W), . . . , \u03c1j0 +p\u22121 (W). By Step 1, the image by \u03c1 of each of these atoms\nis contained in an atom of Ak\u0303 , so they must satisfy:\n\u03c1(Bp\u22121 ) \u2282 B0\n\nand\n\n\u03c1(Bk\u22121 ) \u2282 Bk\n\n\u2200 k \u2208 {1, . . . , p \u2212 1}.\n\nMoreover, by Lemma 5.11 there exists (i0 , . . . , ip\u22121 ) \u2208 I0p such that B k \u2282 \u03a3ick for all\n0 6 k 6 p \u2212 1. Therefore, this family of atoms satisfy the hypothesis of Lemma 5.13.\nSince \u03c1k\u0303+j0 (V) \u2208 B0 and \u03c9(V) = \u03c9(\u03c1k\u0303+j0 (V)), we conclude that \u03c9(V) is a periodic orbit\nof period p contained in the union of the atoms Bk 's. Note that it may exit at most #Ak\u0303\ndifferent families satisfying Lemma 5.13 and thus at most #Ak\u0303 different periodic orbits in\nS\u03b7 .\nStep 3 We have shown that the \u03c9-limit set of any point of S\u03b7 is a periodic orbit contained\nin S\u03b7 . We finish the proof of the propostion by showing that any periodic orbit in S\u03b7 is\nactually a limit cycle.\nSuppose \u1e7c is a periodic point of period p and let L = {\u1e7c, \u03c1(\u1e7c), . . . , \u03c1p\u22121 (\u1e7c)} \u2282 S\u03b7\nbe its orbit. We have to prove that there exists an open neighborhood of L which points\nhave L as \u03c9-limit set (i.e, the basin of attraction of L contains an open neighborhood of\nL). For all k \u2208 {0, . . . , p \u2212 1} we have \u03c1k (\u1e7c) \u2208 \u03a3\u2217{ik } where (i1 , . . . , ip ) \u2208 I0p . Since the\n\ncontinuity piece \u03a3\u2217{ik } is open, there exists an open ball B(\u03c1k (\u1e7c), ak ) of center \u03c1k (\u1e7c) and\nradius ak > 0 whose closure is contained in \u03a3\u2217{ik } . Let 0 < a < min{ak , 0 6 k 6 p \u2212 1}\nand B be the open neighborhood of L defined by:\nB=\n\np\u22121\n[\n\nBk\n\nwhere\n\nBk = B(\u03c1k (\u1e7c), a)\n\nk=0\n\n38\n\n\u2200 k \u2208 {0, . . . , p \u2212 1}.\n\n\fWe have B k \u2208 \u03a3\u2217{ik } , and if we show that \u03c1(Bp\u22121 ) \u2282 B0 and \u03c1(Bk\u22121 ) \u2282 Bk for all\nk \u2208 {0, . . . , p \u2212 1}, then we can apply Lemma 5.13 to prove that the open set B contains a\nunique periodic orbit (L) which is the \u03c9-limit set of all the points of B. We will only prove\nthat \u03c1(Bp\u22121 ) \u2282 B0 , the other inclusions admit an analogous proof. If V \u2208 Bp\u22121 then V\nand \u03c1p\u22121 (\u1e7c) belong to the same piece of continuity \u03a3\u2217{ip\u22121 } . Applying the contraction\nproperty of \u03c1 we obtain:\nk\u03c1(V) \u2212 \u03c1p (\u1e7c)k 6 \u03bbkV \u2212 \u03c1p\u22121 (\u1e7c)k < \u03bba < a.\nIn other words k\u03c1(V) \u2212 \u1e7ck < a which implies \u03c1(V) \u2208 B0 .\n\n6\n\n\u2737\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the present paper, we gave a mathematical analysis of the dynamics of IF neural\nnetworks, with an arbitrary number of neurons interacting by instantaneous excitations\nand inhibitions. The main purpose was to give a global analysis describing the asymptotic\nbehavior of all the solutions of the model.\nOur study is in part motivated by the comparison of continuous time IF neural networks\nwith discrete time versions, such as those analyzed in [9]. An important characteristics of\nthe model of [9] is that it is piecewise contractive in the whole the phase space. In our\ncase where time is continuous, we show that the associated return map does not fulfill\nthis property trivially. In particular, we found sets of parameters where the return map\nexhibits expansion and has a repulsive periodic orbit. It is therefore necessary to impose\nsome conditions on the parameters values for the return map to be piecewise contractive\nin the whole phase space. We have proposed such conditions through the hypothesis\n(H3), which states that the interactions have to be sufficiently strong, or equivalently, the\nresistance of the neural membrane R and/or the external current Iext sufficiently weak.\nHowever, since it is a non-trivial task to find parameters for which the return map exhibits\nreal expansion, there certainly exist other sets of parameters than those defined by (H3),\nfor which the return map is piecewise contracting in the whole phase space.\nThe property of piecewise contraction is mainly relevant to analyze the behavior of\nnetworks containing inhibitory neurons. We also study the dynamics of networks exclusively composed of excitatory neurons. For these networks, we only assume that all the\ninteractions are strictly positive. We show that if the number of neurons is sufficiently\nlarge then, for any initial state, the network gets synchronized in a finite time. These\nresults complete the work of [23], since we allow the weights of the excitatory synapses\nto be mutually different, while in [23] all the interactions are equal to a same constant.\nThe number of neurons that are necessary to provoke this global synchronization, as well\nas the duration of the transient regime, is a decreasing function of the minimum positive\nvalue of the interactions. We show in concrete examples, that if the number of neurons is\nnot large enough, then the global synchronization does not occur, since the network also\npresents some non synchronized periodic orbits. The relevance of the number of neurons\n(connections) for the synchronization has also been observed in [12] where the effectiveness\n39\n\n\fof the connections between neurons is modeled by a random variable. The synchronization is observed for high probability of connection. But if this probability is small, then\nasynchronous states appear.\nComing back to the region of parameters defined by (H3), we have shown that the\nreturn map of a network containing inhibitory neurons, satisfies a general definition of\npiecewise contractive map (Definition 5.2). To analyze the asymptotic dynamics of such\nmaps, we define two complementary sets of the phase space: the stable set and the sensitive\nset. The stable points fulfill a criterion of stability which is weaker than the negativeness\nof all the Lyapunov exponents. Our criterion is well defined even for maps which are\nneither differentiable nor continuous, and it is satisfied in particular by the maps with\nnegative maximal Lyapunov exponent. On the other hand, the orbit of a sensitive point\ncan be drastically modified by some arbitrarily small perturbations which change the firing\nneurons. The sensitive set contains all the points whose orbit gets arbitrarily near to the\ndiscontinuities set of the return map.\nWe show that the stable set of a piecewise contractive map contains a countable number\n(possibly infinite) of limit cycles such that the union of their basins of attraction contains\nall the stable points. It results that the asymptotic dynamics of a network with a stable\ninitial state is periodic. The limit cycles are persistent under deterministic and stochastic\nperturbations, provided that their amplitude is small enough. Nevertheless, not all the\nlimit cycles have the same stability, in particular, those that are near to sensitive points,\ncan be destroyed by small, but non infinitesimal, perturbations. An orbit approaching\nthem can therefore suffer a drastic change under the influence of a small perturbation.\nThis perturbation typically changes the basin of attraction the orbits belongs to, and it\nenlarges the transient time necessary to reach a limit cycle. Moreover, these \"weakly\"\nstable cycles have the longest transient times to approach them and the largest periods.\nIn the extreme case where the stable set contains an infinite number of limit cycles, an\ninfinity of them are concentrated near to sensitive points. It results that these limit cycles\nattract a large region of the phase space, and that their experimental observation needs\nhigh precision and large time scales. The existence of very long disordered transients in\na stable dynamics has been described as stable chaos in [24] or virtual chaos in [9] and\nhas been observed in numerical simulations of neural networks in [9], [29] and [30)], for\ninstance.\nOn the other hand, the characterization of all the possible attractors of the sensitive\nset is still an open question. Nevertheless, it is known that for one dimensional piecewise\ncontractive maps the attractor of the sensitive points is essentially a Cantor set. Also, in [8]\nit has been reported that in higher dimension, other kind of attractors with a cardinality or\na complexity lower or higher than the one of a Cantor set can exist. None of the examples\ndescribed in [8] contains periodic orbits. We can therefore expect that the asymptotic\nperiodic dynamics of stable IF neural networks can coexist with a non periodic sensitive\ndynamics. The coexistence of stable and sensitive dynamics in the same system, as well\nas the abundance of stable chaos, depend on how intricate are the sensitive set and the\nstable set and on their respective size.\nIt is mainly admitted that the existence of strong chaos needs expansivity. We have\nshown that IF neural networks can have such a property. Our main purpose was to\n40\n\n\fshow that some conditions were needed for the return map to be piecewise contractive.\nHowever, it would be interesting to make a deeper study of the phenomenon of non global\ncontraction or expansivity, in some region of the phase space, as in Theorem 2. Although\nour result is stated in a different way, its proof relies on the existence of a repulsive periodic\norbit. We think that it is possible to find more of these orbits, which would be a further\nstep in the research of chaos in neural networks.\nTo sum up, in the present paper we give a rigorous analysis of the asymptotic dynamics\nof a family of IF neural networks. Our analysis is principally qualitative and proved under\nwell posed hypothesis, which can certainly be relaxed. In particular, the results about the\nstable dynamics of the networks under study are proved in some region of the parameters,\nwhere the return map is a piecewise contraction. But these results apply to any piecewise\ncontractive map satisfying the general Definition 5.2. Therefore, Proposition 5.9 and\nTheorem 5, as well as their consequences, will then be true for any neural network (possibly\nmore sophisticated) in the parameters region where its return map satisfies Definition 5.2.\nAlso, the proofs of the principal theorems and propositions give some hints to obtain more\nquantitative results. We hope that the results of the present paper have helped to identify\nsome important concepts and to pose some basis of future studies.\n\n7\n7.1\n\nAppendix: Some technical proofs.\nProof of Lemma 3.3\n\nLet i 6= j \u2208 I. To prove the Lemma 3.3, we suppose the neurons i and j satisfy the four\nconditions (O1), (O2) and (O3) stated before the lemma.\nStep 1: We show that \u0393i \u2282 \u03a3I\\{j} , that is to say J(V) = I \\ {j} (to prove \u0393j \u2282 \u03a3I\\{i}\njust permute i and j). Suppose V \u2208 \u0393i . Then, Vk < Vi for all k 6= i and the neuron i\nis the only neuron which reaches the threshold spontaneously at time ti (V) = t\u0304(V). It\nimplies that V \u2208 \u03a3i and J0 (V) = {i} (recall (9)).\n\nNow let us compute the set of the neurons that fire by interaction with the neuron i\nat time t\u0304(V). Let k \u2208 I \\ J0 (V) = I \\ {i}, then using (8) with Vk = 0 we obtain\nt\u0304(V)\n\n\u03c6k\n\n(V) +\n\nX\n\nt (V)\n\nHlk = \u03c6ki\n\nl\u2208J0 (V) : Hlk >0\n\n(V) + Hik = \u03b2 \u2212\n\n\u03b2(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8)\n+ Hik ,\n\u03b2 \u2212 Vi\n\nwhich belongs to (Hik , c\u2217 + Hik ) since Vi \u2208 (c\u2217 , \u03b8). If k 6= j, then k \u2208\n/ {i, j} and by\nhypothesis (O2) we have Hik > \u03b8. Therefore, k \u2208 J1 (V). If k = j, by hypothesis (O1) we\nhave Hik < c\u2217 \u2212 \u03b8 and k \u2208\n/ J1 (V). We deduce that J1 (V) = I \\ {j}.\n\nNow let us compute the set of the neurons that fire by interaction with the neuron of\nJ1 (V ) at time t\u0304(V). Let k \u2208 I \\ J1 (V) = {j}, then using (8) with Vj = 0 and (O1) we\nobtain\nX\nX\nt (V)\nt\u0304(V)\nHlk = \u03c6ji (V) +\n\u03c6k (V) +\nHlj < c\u2217 + \u03b8 \u2212 c\u2217 = \u03b8.\nl6=j : Hlj >0\n\nl\u2208J1 (V) : Hlk >0\n\n41\n\n\fIt follows that j \u2208\n/ J2 (V). We deduce that J2 (V) = J1 (V) = I \\ {j} and then J(V) =\nI \\ {j}.\nStep 2: We show that there exists (a, b) \u2282 (c\u2217 , \u03b8) such that for all V \u2208 \u0393i verifying\nVi \u2208 (a, b) we have \u03c1(V) \u2208 \u0393j . Suppose V \u2208 \u0393i . From step 1, we have \u0393i \u2282 \u03a3I\\{j} ,\nwhich implies \u03c1k (V) = 0 for all k 6= j. Remains to show that for some c\u2217 < a < b < \u03b8, if\nVi \u2208 (a, b) then \u03c1j (V) \u2208 (c\u2217 , \u03b8).\nSince, t\u0304(V) = ti (V) using (8) we obtain\n\u03c1j (V) = gj (Vi ) where gj (x) := \u03b2 \u2212\n\n\u03b2(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8) X\n+\nHlj\n\u03b2\u2212x\nl6=j\n\n\u2200 x 6= \u03b2.\n\n\u2217\nThe function gj being strictly\nx \u2208 (c\u2217 , \u03b8). By\nPdecreasing, \u2217gj (x) \u2208 (gj (\u03b8), gj (c )) for all\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n(O3) we have gj (c ) = c + l6=j Hlj > c and by (O1) we have gj (c ) < \u03b8. It results\nthat gj (c\u2217 ) \u2208 (c\u2217 , \u03b8). Thus, the function gj being continuous there exists (a, b) \u2282 (c\u2217 , \u03b8)\nsuch that gj (x) \u2208 (c\u2217 , \u03b8) for all x \u2208 (a, b). It follows that \u03c1j (V) = gj (Vi ) \u2208 (c\u2217 , \u03b8) for all\nVi \u2208 (a, b), which is the desired result.\n\nNote that gj is injective in (c\u2217 , \u03b8), so \u03c1 is injective \u0393i .

First, note that for all V,\nW in \u03a3, we have:\nd(\u03c1(V), \u03c1(W)) =\n\nn0\nX\nk\u03c1i (V) \u2212 \u03c1i (W)k\ni=1\n\n\u03bci\u22121\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nk\u03c1n0 (V) \u2212 \u03c1n0 (W)k\n\u2212\nkV\n\u2212\nWk\n.\n= \u03bc d(V, W) +\n\u03bcn0\nNow, suppose V and W in PJ0 ...Jn0 for some J0 . . . Jn0 \u2208 P (I). Then, applying Lemma\n7.1 we obtain:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u0013n 0\n\u03bb\nkV \u2212 Wk \u2212 kV \u2212 Wk .\nd(\u03c1(V), \u03c1(W)) 6 \u03bc d(V, W) + c\n\u03bc\nBy definition of \u03bc and n0 , we have then\nd(\u03c1(V), \u03c1(W)) 6 \u03bcd(V, W)\n43\n\n\fwhich ends the proof of Theorem 3.\nAcknowledgements: We thank R.
