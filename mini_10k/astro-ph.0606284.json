INTRODUCTION\n\nThe study of star formation has made tremendous\nstrides over the past two decades. Advances in observational capabilities have allowed a number of phases of\nthe star formation process to be identified and characterized, starting with the centrally concentrated core of\nmolecular gas that collapses to form a star surrounded\nby a proto-planetary disk. It has been the isolation of\nsuch objects that have not yet formed stars \u2013 pre-stellar\ncores \u2013 that has allowed us to probe the earliest initial\nstages of star formation (see Andr\u00e9 et al. 2000; Alves,\nLada & Lada 2000). Most of the progress has focused\non the formation of low-mass stars, predominantly because these objects can form isolated from other nearby\nstars that reduces confusion, and, conveniently, there is\na large sample of such objects located in nearby clouds.\nHowever, it has now been recognized that most stars that\nare more massive than the Sun do not form in isolated\nfashion, but rather in clusters of >100 stars (Zinnecker\net al. 1993).\nProgress in our understanding of high-mass star formation has been hampered by a number of factors: (1)\ntimescales for massive star formation are short and examples in a given state are intrinsically rare, (2) the large\ndistances to the Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) that\nare the birth sites of massive stars make studies of individual objects difficult, and (3) the very nature of clustered star formation increases confusion (cf. Garay &\nLizano 1999). As a result, the objects in the earliest\nphases \u2013 the \"pre-stellar massive cores\" \u2013 have been difficult to identify.\n1 Dept. of Astronomy, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI,\nUSA\n2 Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada\n3 Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge,\nMA, USA\n4 Dept. of Physics, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN,\nUSA\n5 Arizona Radio Observatory, Tuson, AZ, USA\n\nThe traditional method of locating low-mass cores has\nbeen to examine optical plates for regions of obscured\nstarlight and then to pursue follow up molecular line observations (Myers & Benson 1983; Lee & Myers 1999).\nA comparison with the IRAS point source catalog then\ndenotes whether these cores are associated with newly\nformed stars (Beichmann et al. 1986). This method cannot be applied to massive star forming regions since the\ngreater distances makes isolating individual objects difficult. Moreover, the size and high column densities of\nGMCs makes it impossible to use optical plates to find\nindividual objects. An analogous method of searching\nfor molecular cores is to search for obscured regions in\ngalactic mid-infrared background. However, due to atmospheric constraints, ground-based observations in the\nmid-IR are difficult to obtain. The ISOCAM instrument\non the Infrared Space Observatory was used in this fashion, but only with pointed observations towards previously identified cores (e.g. Bacmann et al. 2000).\nThe Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) surveyed the\ngalactic plane in mid-infrared bands spanning from 7 to\n25 \u03bcm. This survey revealed a large population of dark\nclouds, predominantly located toward the inner galaxy\n(Egan et al. 1998). Follow-up molecular studies of a few\nobjects confirmed that the obscured regions represent a\nnew population of dense, n(H2 ) > 105 cm\u22123 , and cold,\nT < 20 K, molecular clouds (Carey et al 1998). Further\ncomparison to IRAS images demonstrated that most of\nthese clouds are dark from 7\u2013100 \u03bcm, presumably because these objects either do not contain newly formed\nstars, or any newly formed stars are very deeply embedded. As such, a sub-sample of these objects may trace\nmassive pre-stellar cores. There has been substantial activity in this field recently, with numerous groups analyzing various samples of infrared dark clouds (IRDCs).\nThese studies have shown that it is likely that IRDCs\nare the birth-sites of high-mass stars and stellar clusters\n(Sridharan et al. 2005, Menten et al. 2005, Rathborne\net al. 2006, Pillai et al. 2006).\nWe have identified a sample of infrared dark clouds and\n\n\f2\n\nRagan et al.\n\nsearched them for emission from the N2 H+ 1 \u2192 0, CS\n2 \u2192 1 and C18 O 1 \u2192 0 transitions (\u00a72). In most cases,\nwe find that the emission closely corresponds to the MSX\ndark regions. Using a gas temperature of T=15 K based\non CO 1 \u2192 0 data, we deduce several properties of the\ndark clouds including column density and mass (\u00a73). We\nsummarize our findings and the implications (\u00a74).\n2. SOURCE SELECTION & OBSERVATIONS\n\nTo search for pre-stellar massive cores we have compiled a catalog of MSX dark clouds. This catalog is biased, as we have only searched the released MSX band A\n(centered at 8.8 \u03bcm) images for infrared dark clouds in\nthe vicinity of known ultra-compact (UC) HII regions\nfrom the Wood & Churchwell (1989) catalog. More\nspecifically, we searched for absorbing clouds within a\nsquare degree centered on a given UC HII region. This\nstrategy takes advantage of the fact that young stars\ngenerally form in clusters, and, therefore, a good place\nto search for the pre-cursors to massive stars is in the\nvicinity of regions with current massive star formation\nevidenced by the UC HII regions. In this fashion we\nhave isolated 114 infrared dark clouds, of which only a\nsmall fraction (15%) have known associations with radio\nsources or masers. From this catalog of 114 infrared dark\nclouds we selected a sub-sample of the 41 most compact\nand most opaque (\u03c48.8\u03bcm & 0.4) cores and targeted these\nfor molecular line observations.\nWe mapped 41 of the sample of MSX dark clouds in\nemission from C18 O J = 1 \u2192 0 (\u03bd = 109.782 GHz), CS\nJ = 2 \u2192 1 (\u03bd = 97.981 GHz), and N2 H+ J = 1 \u2192 0\n(\u03bd = 93.173 GHz) using the 14m Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO). The observations were\nmade in 2002 February, May & December using the\n16 element focal plane array receiver SEQUOIA. Each\n2.5\u2032 \u00d7 2.5\u2032 region was mapped with the 50\u2032\u2032 beam, with\ntypical rms noise levels of \u223c 0.05 \u2212 0.1 K. We used the\nNarrow Band Correlator backend configured to a velocity resolution of \u223c 0.13 km s\u22121 . Typical system temperatures (Tsys ) were 200 \u2212 300K. Main beam efficiencies (\u03b7mb ) were approximated at 50% from the standard\nFCRAO values. This is accurate within a few percent for\neach transition. For each spectrum, a first-order, linear\nbaseline was fit to remove instrumental and continuum\noffsets and drift.\nThis selection of species is motivated by studies of lowmass pre-stellar clouds. N2 H+ is unlikely to significantly\nsuffer from the effects of depletion as the core condenses,\nand this species is a good tracer of the dense centers\nof starless cores (Bergin & Langer 1997; Tafalla et al.\n2002). Conversely, C18 O and CS emission can be used\nto trace the outer layers. Table 1 lists some basic dark\ncloud properties such as the HII region name, the coordinates, the size, and the center-to-edge brightness contrast. The brightness contrast was obtained by comparing the brightness in the band centered at 8.8 \u03bcm at the\ncenter of the core with the average background brightness, estimated from an average of the intensities in a\nvertical and horizontal slit across the dark region. If the\ndark cloud was searched for molecular emission, we provide the LSR velocity range to which the observations\nwere sensitive.\nIn an appendix, we provide a source by source description of any associations with known star formation in-\n\ndicators (e.g. IRAS sources, masers, radio continuum\nsources). The large majority of our sources have no association with any known strong infrared source.\n3. RESULTS\n3.1. Molecular Line Fits\nEach line is fit with a Gaussian profile to determine the\nintegrated intensity, line width, and the LSR velocity of\nthe emitting material. Table 2 presents the results of the\nspectral line fitting. All parameters were extracted by\nstandard Gaussian fitting methods in the CLASS package (Buisson et al. 2002); for N2 H+ , the seven main\nhyperfine components were fit together using the HFS\nroutine. The reported line-center velocity corresponds to\nthat of the strongest hyperfine component (J = 1 \u2192 0,\nF1 , F = 2, 3 \u2192 1, 2) at 93.1738 GHz.\nOur observations were obtained with velocity resolution of 0.13 km s\u22121 , and to increase the signal to noise,\nwe on occasion smoothed the line profiles by a factor of\n2. As such, we had little sensitivity to structure within\nthe line. Within our sensitivity limits (see \u00a72), we see\nno evidence for extended line wings, and all lines were\nwell-fit by single Gaussians. We report here only basic\nline properties.\n3.2. Molecular Emission Morphologies\n\nFigure 1 displays the Midcourse Space Experiment\n(MSX) images of each dark cloud overlayed with the\nintegrated intensity maps of molecular emission for all\nobserved molecular transitions. The contour levels for\neach dark cloud are specified in the captions. In some\ncases, multiple velocity components are detected, and the\ndifferent velocity components are given different colors.\nThe blue contours always correspond to the molecular\nemission morphology that most closely corresponds to\nthe distribution of 8 \u03bcm absorption seen in the MSX image, and, therefore, is most likely to be associated with\nthe dark cloud. The line properties of the other velocity\ncomponents (i.e. emission that is unassociated with the\nabsorbing cloud) are not reported. There are three cases\nin which an a/b designation was assigned to distinguish\ntwo emission peaks. For G14.33-0.57 and G23.48-0.53,\nthere are two spatially distinct and separate emission\npeaks at approximately the same characteristic velocity. This may suggest that in these cases, we were able\nto resolve spatially separated fragments of a cloud. In\nthe case of G37.44+0.14, there are two velocity components that appear to correspond to absorbing regions (the\n40km s\u22121 feature corresponding to the central absorbing\ncloud; the 18km s\u22121 feature correpsonding to absorption to the north and west). Based on our assumptions,\nthis would indicate that there are two unassociated dark\nclouds apparent in the same region of the sky by chance.\nThe morphological differences seen in Figure 1 are\nstriking. Some maps show well defined cores in all three\nmolecular tracers (e.g. G32.01+0.05). Other maps, like\nG06.26-0.51, show fairly well defined cores in C18 O and\nCS, but nothing obvious is seen in the N2 H+ . And others,\nlike G09.21-0.22 , show a strong centrally concentrated\nN2 H+ core but CS that is much more diffuse. Finally,\nthere are cores like G10.59-0.31 that show no real evidence for molecular emission centered on the dark cloud\nat all. In this case, it is possible that any molecular emis-\n\n\fMSX cores\nsion directly associated with the dark cloud lies outside\nof the observed velocity band (see Table 1).\nThese differences in the molecular emission maps may\nbe the result of differences in the evolutionary states.\nIt is well known that CS and C18 O can form relatively\nquickly in the gas phase whereas N2 H+ takes significantly\nlonger. However, as density enhances, the CS and C18 O\ntend to deplete onto the surfaces of dust grains, whereas\nN2 H+ will remain in the gas phase. Upon protostar formation, CS and C18 O can be released from dust grain\nsurfaces (e.g. see models of Bergin & Langer 1997; Lee\net al. 2004). Therefore, two scenarios can lead to the\nlow abundance of N2 H+ relative to CS or C18 O: the star\nforming core is at an early stage of condensation and the\ndensities are low such that CS and C18 O would be not\naffected by dust depletion, or the presence of a protostar has released the CS and C18 O from dust grains, all\nthe while the N2 H+ abundance is essentially unchanged\nthroughout the process. Another possible explanation\nof the differences seen in the maps is that some of the\ndark clouds may contain as yet undetected protostars,\nobscured by the high opacity apparent in the 8.8 \u03bcm\nMSX images. If a protostar is present, it can alter the\nlocal gas chemistry via grain mantle evaporation, which\ncan change the emission morphologies (J\u00f8rgensen 2004).\nWe are using data from the Spitzer Space Telescope to\ndetermine which dark clouds are truly starless and which\ncontain embedded protostars in a sub-sample of these objects (Ragan et al. 2006, in prep.).\n3.3. Distance Estimates\n\nThe kinematic distance to each dark cloud is calculated using using the line center velocity and the Milky\nWay rotation curve model of Fich, Blitz, & Stark (1989).\nThe distance assignments are presented in Table 3 for\ndark clouds for which we estimated masses. (Sources\nto which we are unable to assign a distance or those\nthat show no significant emission are not subject to further calculations.) For every position, there is both a\n\"near\" and \"far\" distance solution that corresponds to\nthe characteristic velocity of the emission. In addition to\nthis ambiguity, Fich, Blitz, & Stark (1989) cite a \u00b114%\nmaximal deviation of the data from their rotation curve\nmodel; based on this consideration, we calculate errors in\nthe distances and provide them in Table 3. In the cases\nwhere no error range (or an incomplete one) is given,\nno physical solution exists when calculating the distance\nwith that error offset. For all subsequent calculations,\nwe assume that the dark cloud is located at the \"near\"\ndistance. We believe that this is a reasonable assumption\nsince the clouds are seen in absorption against the Galactic mid-infrared background and, therefore, are unlikely\nto reside at the \"far\" distance. Assuming the \"near\"\nkinematical distance, which is also listed in Table 4, a\ntypical core has a diameter of \u223c0.9 pc.\nInterestingly, the kinematical distances for the velocity component associated with the absorption are seldom\ncoincident with the distances estimated for the UC HII\nregion that was the original search target. In most cases\nwe detect molecular emission at a single velocity, and\nno possible distance solution from the galactic rotation\ncurve is consistent with the distance to the UC HII region. However, in the cases where there are multiple velocity components, the distance to the UC HII region is\n\n3\n\noften consistent with one of the kinematic distance solutions for a secondary velocity component. For example,\nG37.44+0.14 has a secondary detection of a component\nat 18 km s\u22121 , and the \"far\" distance associated with it\n(12.34 kpc) is very close to the distance to the UC HII\nregion (12.0 kpc). In this case, it is likely that we are detecting two clouds along the same line of sight at different\ndistances: one near the UC HII region and one nearer to\nus. Since the emission of the primary component corresponds so well to the absorbing dark cloud, we maintain\nthat these lie at the \"near\" distances, though there is significant uncertainty in the distance calculation. Nonetheless, as we will show, these clouds are massive and are\nlikely associated with the formation of intermediate and\nhigh-mass stars and stellar clusters.\n3.4. Column Densities and Densities\n\nTo determine the molecular abundances relative to\nmolecular hydrogen, we also need a measure of the total\nH2 column density. We estimate N(H2 ) from the MSX\nimages convolved to match the FCRAO beam resolution\nand the simple relation \u03c4\u03bb = \u03c3\u03bb * N(H2 ), where \u03c4\u03bb is\nthe dust opacity, \u03c3\u03bb is the dust extinction cross section,\nand N(H2 ) is the column density of molecular hydrogen. The behavior of the mid-infrared extinction law is\nan area of active research. Recent results from Indebetouw et al. (2005), show agreement with Weingartner &\nDraine (2001) (Rv = 5.5, \"case B\"), we therefore adopt\na value for \u03c3\u03bb at 8.8 \u03bcm of 2.3 \u00d7 10\u221223 cm2 , though this\nvalue can be considered reliable only within a factor of\n2. The opacity, \u03c4\u03bb , is roughly estimated by examining\nthe relative intensities of the average background (Io,\u03bb )\nand central core (I\u03bb ), assuming that I\u03bb = Io,\u03bb e\u2212\u03c4\u03bb (i.e.\nno emission by the core itself). The ratio I\u03bb /Io,\u03bb is related, but not identical, to the brightness contrast listed\nin Table 1, since the values listed in Table 1 do not incorporate the convolution to the FCRAO beam, and are\nprovided at the original MSX resolution.\nThe column densities of C18 O and CS are estimated\nby assuming that the cores are in local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (LTE) at a temperature of 15 K, and that\nthe emission is optically thin (Table 4). While the optically thin assumption is probably reasonable for C18 O,\nit probably does not hold for CS, which generally has\noptically thick emission in the interstellar medium. For\nN2 H+ , the fits to the hyperfine components generally\nsuggest low optical depth, or \u03c4 \u223c1. However, its emission is likely not in LTE. At a density of 105 cm\u22123 , the\nfractional population will be underestimated by a factor\nof \u223c1.7 relative to LTE; we therefore apply this correction factor. We also crudely estimate the gas density by\nassuming the cloud is spherical and dividing the H2 column density by the diameter of the cloud (using the sizes\nlisted in Table 1 and the distances in Table 3). This gives\nan average density of \u2248 5000 cm\u22123 . This is well below\nto the average densities found in other studies of regions\nof massive star formation using other tracers. For example, Plume et al. (1997) surveyed multiple transitions of\nCS in 150 H2 O masers (used as signposts of massive star\nformation) and found an average gas density of 7.9 \u00d7 105\ncm\u22123 . An obvious explanation for the lower density in\nour sample is that the clouds are not spherical, as we\nhave naively assumed, and may instead be clumpy on\nscales below our resolution. Moreover, these objects are\n\n\f4\n\nRagan et al.\n\nlikely at an earlier evolutionary state which is characterized by lower densities. A more detailed analysis of the\ndensity and column density will be presented in future\nwork (Gibson et al. 2007, in prep.).\n3.5. Masses\n\nThe total mass of each dark cloud is estimated using an\nassumed (\"near\") distance, an approximate size based on\nthe extent of molecular emission, the molecular column\ndensities and approximate abundance calculated at the\npeak of absorption. Table 4 lists the masses of the objects for which there is a significant detection of N2 H+ or\nC18 O (or both) and a distance could be assigned. Since\nsome of the dark clouds shown in Figure 1 have a different structure when viewed in different molecular tracers\nand may have different opacities, we have, for completeness, estimated the masses independently based on the\nabundances derived from both the N2 H+ and C18 O data.\nOur average mass is \u2248 2000 \u2212 3000 M\u2299 (depending on\nwhether the N2 H+ or C18 O mass is used).\nFigure 2 shows how the masses of our sample compare\nto the high-mass protostellar objects (HMPOs) presented\nin Williams et al. (2004), which were determined from\nsubmillimeter continuum emission. The masses for the\nHMPO sample are shown for both their \"near\" and \"far\"\nkinematic distances. Assuming that the sample encompasses objects at both the \"near\" and \"far\" kinematic\ndistances, then the derived masses for HMPOs show a\ncomparable range to our sources. One caveat with our\ncomparison to the Williams et al. sample lies in the selection bias of our sample. As we will discuss below,\nour observations are only sensitive to relatively massive\nobjects when the cores reside at such large distances.\nFurthermore, the HMPOs in the Williams et al. study\nalso contain protostars which heat the surrounding environment and increase the dust emission. Therefore, in\nthe warmer environments of the Williams et al. survey,\nlower mass cores would be easier to detect. The mass distribution shown in Figure 2 also shows good agreement\nwith that found by Shirley et al. (2003), who observed\nCS emission from a sample of massive star forming regions and found a mean mass of 920 M\u2299 with a large\ndispersion.\nSeveral assumptions contribute to the uncertainty in\nthe mass calculation, which is dominated by the error in\nthe abundance calculation. We assume a constant temperature of 15 K, and a 5 K change in this value results\nin a \u223c20% change in the abundance. The uncertainty\nin the dust opacity/column density relation contributes\nanother factor of 2. Finally, we assume a constant abundance along the line of sight, which likely contributes an\nadditional factor of 2 \u2013 3 to the mass estimates.\nWe note that the typical distance to these clouds is \u223c4\nkpc, and with 50\u2032\u2032 resolution, we are likely only sensitive to objects of some minimum mass. To examine this\nlimit, we modeled the emission of a cloud assuming a\nconstant density of 105 cm\u22123 , a radius of 0.1pc, an N2 H+\nabundance of 5 \u00d7 10\u221210 using a Monte Carlo radiation\ntransfer model (Ashby et al. 2000). We estimate that\nour observations are capable of detecting clouds of mass\ngreater than 50-100 M\u2299 at a distance of 4 kpc with a 50\u2032\u2032\nbeam.\nAssuming that the \"near\" distance assumption is correct, the uncertainties mentioned above can account for\n\nup to a factor of \u223c 4 \u2212 6 in mass error, as the 14%\nerror in translating the galactic rotation curve to kinematic distances only introduces a distance error of \u223c20%.\nThis accounting suggests that these objects are at least\n100 M\u2299 , and likely an order of magnitude more massive.\nShould the \"near\" distance assumption be incorrect and\nthe dark clouds lie closer to the \"far\" kinematic distance,\nthen the distance error dominates the calculation, and\nthese clouds are substantially more massive.\n3.6. Velocity Dispersion\nThe width of emission lines in star forming clouds\nserves as a useful diagnostic in determining the nature\nof a molecular region. According to Goldsmith (1987),\nthe sites of massive star formation, GMCs, are characterized by large linewidths, while the isolated sites of\nlow-mass star formation, dark clouds, have considerably\nsmaller linewidths. We illustrate this range in Figure 3.\nCaselli et al. (1998) derived linewidths for N2 H+ for a\nsample of low-mass, dense clumps in dark clouds, a site\nin which we expect to find narrow lines. The average\nlinewidth in the Caselli et al. study was 0.33 km s\u22121\nfor clumps in which no IRAS source is detected. Current\nchemical models and observations indicate that NH3 and\nN2 H+ are related because NH3 likely forms via pathways\nlinked N2 H+ (Aikawa et al. 2005). Therefore, we use\nthe Harju et al. (1993) linewidths for NH3 clumps in\nOrion and Cepheus, known to be large regions of clustered, high-mass star formation for comparison. In addition, we include a comparison with linewidths of a sample of ammonia cores presented in Molinari et al. (1996),\nthough we only include only the \"Low\" sources, a sample\nthey argue have less luminous IRAS source, more quiescent envelopes, and, therefore, are younger than their\n\"High\" counterparts. In our sample, we find average\nlinewidths of 2.0 km s\u22121 for N2 H+ , 2.1 km s\u22121 for C18 O,\nand 2.9 km s\u22121 for CS. Though we see a broad range of\nline widths in the N2 H+ observations of the dark clouds,\nthe characteristic line widths presented here are generally higher than those of the Harju et al. study and, to\na greater extent, the Caselli et al. study, which implies\nthat the objects in this sample are likely not associated\nwith low-mass star formation. However, we find good\nagreement with the Molinari et al. sample.\nFor the CS J = 2 \u2192 1 transition, the linewidths\nin the dark cloud sample are narrower than those observed by Plume et al. (1997) in survey of massive star\nforming regions, which averaged 4.2 km s\u22121 in this line.\nHowever, since Plume et al. surveyed regions known\nto have undergone massive star formation, it is possible\nthat the current generation of massive stars are injecting\nadditional turbulence into the surrounding environment.\nSimilarly, the Shirley et al. (2003) study observed the\nCS J = 5 \u2192 4 transition in star-forming cores and found\nlinewidths averaging 5.6 km s\u22121 . The narrower lines in\nthe dark clouds indicates that they are still relatively quiescent and suggest that may, indeed, be pre-cursor sites\nof intermediate or massive star formation.\n4. SUMMARY\n\nWe have identified 41 infrared dark (at 8.8 \u03bcm) clouds\nthat are opaque, compact, and associated with UC HII\nregions using MSX survey data. In order to determine\nsome basic characteristics of these dark clouds, we have\n\n\fMSX cores\nmapped emission from N2 H + 1 \u2192 0, CS 2 \u2192 1 and C18 O\n1 \u2192 0 using the FCRAO. The morphology and relative\nstrengths of these molecular lines varies dramatically,\npossibly indicating evolutionary differences and/or the\npresence of undetected embedded protostar(s). Based\non the derived kinematic distances and the simplifying\nassumption that the cores are optically thin, we have determined average properties: diameter < D >\u2248 0.9 pc,\ndensity < n >\u2248 5000 cm\u22123 , and mass < M >\u2248 2500\nM\u2299 . The low density estimate likely indicates that the\ndark clouds are clumpy rather than homogeneous. The\nderived masses, however, are comparable to those derived\nfor a sample of HMPOs. The linewidths are larger than\nthose seen in low-mass star forming cores and larger than\nin high-mass star forming cores in Orion and Cepheus.\nHowever, they are narrower than the CS linewidths seen\n\n5\n\nin regions that are actively forming massive stars . These\nobservations, taken together, suggest that the infrared\ndark clouds may be the relatively quiescent pre-cursors\nto intermediate or massive star formation, the so-called\n\"pre-protostellar cores.\" At present, we do not know if\nthese sources are truly starless. Only by obtaining very\nsensitive infrared observations can we confirm the starless nature of these cores.\n\nWe are grateful to the referee for a very thorough report, which improved this paper. We are grateful to\nJ. Weingartner for providing detailed dust opacity coefficients. This research has made use of the SIMBAD\ndatabase, operated at CDS, Strasbourg, France\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nCOINCIDENT SOURCES\nThe coordinates of each dark region were examined by the Set of Identifications, Measurements, and Bibliography\nfor Astronomical Data (SIMBAD) database in search of associated objects indicative of active star formation (e.g.\nmasers, IRAS sources, radio sources). In most cases, the searches yielded no results, but some revealed objects within\none arcminute of the dark region's coordinates. Below, we summarize any associations with the objects for which we\npresent emission maps. We note that whenever coincident sources are found, we provide the offsets relative to the\ncentral absorption peak position given in Table 1.\nG09.21\u22120.22 There is an IRAS source (IRAS 18038-2105; \u03b1(2000) = 18h 06m 53.1s , \u03b4(2000) = \u221221\u25e6 04\u2032 38\u2032\u2032 ) in the\nvicinity of this absorbing cloud, offset by 0.\u2032 78 from the center of the dark region.\nG09.88\u22120.11 This region has an associated 1612 MHz OH maser which is cited in Blommaert, Van Langevelde, and\nMichaels (1994). This source, OH 9.878-0.127, has a position of \u03b1(2000) = 18h 07m 59.s 07, \u03b4(2000) = \u221220\u25e6 27\u2032 34.\u2032\u2032 3,\nwhich is offset from the center of our region by 1.\u2032 05. This object may be associated with a circumstellar shell around\nan evolved star, and the velocities believed to correspond to the expanding shells of material are 79.5 and 111.3 km s\u22121 ,\nwhich is not coincident with the velocity of the emission detected here (17 km s\u22121 ).\nG10.59\u22120.31 This region contains a radio source, located at \u03b1(2000) = 18h 10m 6.s 18, \u03b4(2000) = \u221219\u25e6 55\u2032 33.\u2032\u2032 11, according to Zoonematkermani et al. (1990), which is offset from the center of our region by 0.\u2032 44.\nG12.50\u22120.22 There is an IRAS source (IRAS 18197-1812; \u03b1(2000) = 18h 13m 39.s 0, \u03b4(2000) = \u221218\u25e611\u2032 46\u2032\u2032 ) offset by\n0.\u2032 96 from the absorbing region.\nG19.37\u22120.03 This region is near a known UC HII region, with a water and methanol maser (Codella & Felli 1995;\nSzymczak et al. 2000) also identified in the vicinity (\u03b1(2000) = 18h 26m 24.s 3, \u03b4(2000) = \u221212\u25e6 3\u2032 46\u2032\u2032 , offset 0.\u2032 85 from\nthe absorbing region. The peak velocity of this maser is 26.3 km s\u22121 (Szymczak et al. 2000), which is consistent with\nthe velocity of our measured emission (27 km s\u22121 ). Molinari et al. (1996) also observed this maser site and designated\nit as Mol 55.\nG30.89+0.14 This region has an associated methanol maser, as described by Szymczak et al. (2000). The maser\nis located at \u03b1(2000) = 18h 47m 14.s 99, \u03b4(2000) = \u22121\u25e6 44\u2032 7.\u2032\u2032 99, which is offset from the center of our region by 0.\u2032 99.\nSzymczak et al. (2000), using a 6.7 GHz survey, measured the internal velocity of the maser source to be \u2248 105 km/s,\nthe velocity of the peak to be 101.5 km/s. This is consistent with one of the velocity components we measured in this\nobject (108 km s\u22121 ).\nG32.01+0.05 This region has an associated IRAS point source (18470-0050) which is offset from the center of our\nregion by 1.\u2032 00 at \u03b1(2000) = 18h 49m 36.s 6, \u03b4(2000) = \u221200\u25e646\u2032 51\u2032\u2032 which coincides with a radio source (Becker et al.\n1994). This was confirmed to be a methanol maser (observed in the velocity range between 91 and 102 km s\u22121 ) by\nvan der Walt et al. (1995), which is consistent with the emission we observed at 95 km s\u22121 .\nG34.74\u22120.12 This region has an associated IRAS point source (18526+0130) which is offset from the center of our\nregion by 0.\u2032 80 at \u03b1(2000) = 18h 55m 10s , \u03b4(2000) = +1\u25e6 33\u2032 57\u2032\u2032 .\nREFERENCES\nAikawa, Y., Herbst, E., Roberts, H., & Caselli, P. 2005, ApJ, 620,\n330\nAlves, J.
