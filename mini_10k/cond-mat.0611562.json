For example, the transistor gate oxide is now only\na few atomic layers thick.10\nThe interaction between electrons and nuclear vibrations plays an important role for the electron transport at\nthe nanometer scale,11,12 and is being addressed experimentally in ultimate atomic-sized systems.13,14,15,16,17,18\nEffects on the electronic current due to energy dissipation from electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions are relevant, not only because they affect device characteristics,\ninduce chemical reactions,19 and ultimately control the\nstability; these may also be used for spectroscopy to deduce structural information-such as the bonding configuration in a nanoscale junction-which is typically not\naccessible by other techniques simultaneously with transport measurements.\nThe signatures of e-ph interaction have been observed\nin a variety of nanosystems. In the late 1990s inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) on single\nmolecules was successfully demonstrated using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM).13 Later, in the quantum dot regime, measurements on a single C60 transistor showed features indicating a strong coupling between\n\ncenter-of-mass motion of the molecule and single-electron\nhopping.14 Point contact spectroscopy has also revealed\nphonon signals in the high-conductance regime, e.g., in\natomic wires15 and individual molecules.16 Most recently,\ninelastic measurements have also been reported on SAMs\nof alkyl- and \u03c0-conjugated molecular wires.20,21,22 These\ndevelopments show the need for fully atomistic quantitative theories to accurately model structural, vibrational,\nand transport properties of nanoscale systems.\nThe density functional theory (DFT) approach offers\nan atomistic description of total energy properties of\nnanosystems without system specific adjustable parameters. Furthermore, in combination with the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method23,24 it has recently become a popular approach to quantum transport in atomic structures.25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32 From the\ncomparison with experimental data it has been established that total energy properties such as atomic structure and vibrations in general are well described by\nDFT with the local or gradient approximations for exchange and correlation.33 However, while transport properties may also be calculated from DFT this is not rigorously justified.34,35 On the other hand such an approach can serve as a good starting point for more\nsophisticated approaches correcting for errors in, e.g.,\nthe excitation spectrum, such as time-dependent DFT,36\nthe GW approximation,37,38,39 or self-interaction corrected DFT.40,41 In weakly coupled molecular conductors electron-electron interaction effects play a significant\nrole. While some Coulomb blockade effects have been\ndescribed using spin-density functional theory,42 the correlation effects are more complicated to treat. In this direction the addition of a Hubbard-like term on top of the\n\n\f2\nDFT Hamiltonian has been used.43 These more advanced\ndevelopments often come at the price of limitations to\nthe size of the systems that feasibly can be handled. It\nis therefore interesting to investigate to what extent the\nconventional DFT-NEGF can be used to model various\ntransport properties.\nIn this paper we present a scheme for including the\neffects of e-ph interaction into one such DFT-NEGF\nmethod for electronic transport. Specifically, we describe\nin detail our implementation of methods based on a combination of the Siesta44 and the Transiesta26 DFT\ncomputer codes. Siesta provides the fundamental implementation of Kohn-Sham DFT in an atomic basis set for\nsystems described in a supercell representation (periodic\nboundary conditions). Transiesta, on the other hand,\nuses the Siesta framework to solve self-consistently the\nKohn-Sham DFT equations for the nonequilibrium electron density in the presence of a current flow, taking\ninto account the full atomistic structure of both device\nand electrodes (no periodicity in the transport direction).\nWe describe how the Siesta and Transiesta methods\nhave been extended for inelastic transport analysis, which\ninvolves the calculation of (i) relaxed geometries, (ii) vibrational frequencies, (iii) e-ph couplings, and (iv) inelastic current-voltage characteristics up to the level of the\nself-consistent Born approximation (SCBA). We also describe approximations leading to a lowest order expansion\n(LOE) of the SCBA expressions, which vastly simplifies\nthe computational burden.45,46\nWhile there have already been many studies devoted to transport with e-ph interaction based\non model Hamiltonians emphasizing various aspects\nof the transport,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61\nthere has only been a handful based on a complete firstprinciples description of all aspects of the e-ph transport\nproblem (described below). By this distinction we intend\nto emphasize approaches where structural, vibrational,\nand transport properties are derived from the knowledge of the elemental constituents only, i.e., without any\nsystem-dependent adjustable parameters. So far these\nhave almost entirely been based on DFT for the electronic structure.\nIn the tunneling regime the atomic resolution of the\nSTM has been used to investigate spatial variations of the\ninelastic tunneling process through adsorbed molecules\non metallic surfaces. Corresponding inelastic STM images were simulated theoretically by Lorente and Persson with DFT and the Tersoff-Hamann approach.62,63\nAlso controlled conformational changes, molecular motion, and surface chemistry induced by the inelastic tunnel current in STM have been addressed.64,65,66\nMore recently the regime where an atomic-scale conductor is more strongly coupled to both electrodes\nhas also been investigated. Based on a self-consistent\ntight-binding procedure with parameters obtained from\nDFT,29 Pecchia et al. considered vibrational effects in\noctanethiols bonded to gold electrodes using NEGF and\nthe Born approximation (BA) for the e-ph interaction.67\n\nSolomon et al. further used this method to simulate the\nexperimental IETS spectra of Wang et al.21,68 Sergueev\net al. studied a 1,4-benzenedithiolate molecule contacted\nby two aluminum leads.69 This study addressed the bias\ndependence of the vibrational modes and e-ph couplings,\nbut not the inelastic current itself. While the vibrational spectrum was found to be almost unchanged, a\nsignificant change in the e-ph couplings was found at\nhigh bias voltages (Vbias > 0.5 V). Chen et al. studied\ninelastic scattering and local heating in an atomic gold\ncontact, a thiol-bonded benzene, and alkanethiols.70,71,72\nThe inelastic signals were calculated using a golden-ruletype of expression and the DFT scattering states where\ncalculated using jellium electrodes.73 However, contrary\nto experiments and most calculations on molecules-for\nexample Refs.20,21,67,68,74,75,76-they predict conductance decreases by the phonons for alkanethiols. Jiang\net al. used a related golden-rule approach for molecular\nsystems.74 Troisi et al. suggested a simplified approach\nfrom which IETS signals can be calculated approximately\nbased on ab initio calculations for an isolated cluster and\nneglecting the electrodes.75,77 This scheme was shown to\nbe suitable for the off-resonance regime, i.e., when the\nmolecular levels are far away from the Fermi level. Their\nresults compare well with experiments by Kushmerick\net al.20 During the development of the scheme presented\nhere, we studied the same molecular systems with similar results.45,76 We also used it to model inelastic effects\nthat can be observed in atomic gold wires.78\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we communicate our first-principles approach to obtain a Hamiltonian description of a vibrating atomic-scale device bridging two metallic contacts, such as schematically shown in\nFig. 1. Specifically we describe the use of Siesta to calculate vibrational modes and e-ph couplings. Section III\naddresses the NEGF formalism used to calculate the inelastic electron transport in steady state as well as the\nSCBA and LOE schemes for the e-ph interaction. Electrode self-energies are obtained using the Transiesta\nscheme. We further discuss local heating effects and how\nvarious broadening mechanisms of the inelastic signal can\nbe addressed. The main steps of the method presented\nin Sec. II and III, and how these depend on each other,\nare schematically clarified in Fig. 2. In Sec. IV and V we\nillustrate our approach by corroborating and extending\nour previous studies of atomic gold wires and hydrocarbon molecules. Section IV gives results for an extensive\nset of calculations for atomic gold wires of varying length\nand strain conditions. From these calculations we identify a number of physical effects, e.g., the evolution of a\nvibrational selection rule that becomes more pronounced\nthe longer the wire is. Section V illustrates that our\nmethod is applicable to a wide range of systems, here\nexemplified by different hydrocarbon molecules between\ngold surfaces. Both applications also underline the usefulness of the LOE scheme, which we validate by a comparison the full SCBA calculation. Finally in Sec. VI we\nprovide a summary of the paper and an outlook.\n\n\f3\n\na)\n\nPeriodic BCs\n\ncan be described by the following Hamiltonian\n0\nb = H\nb e0 + H\nb ph\nb e-ph ,\nH\n+H\nX\n0 \u2020\nb e0 =\nHij\nb\nci b\ncj ,\nH\n\nDynamic Atoms\n\n(1a)\n(1b)\n\ni,j\n\n0\nb ph\nH\n=\n\nDevice (D)\n\nb e-ph =\nH\n\nb)\n-I\nLeft (L)\n\nDevice (D)\n\nRight (R)\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic of two generic system setups. (a) To calculate vibrational frequencies and e-ph couplings with Siesta\nwe use a supercell setup with periodic boundary conditions\n(BCs) in all directions. The cell contains the device region D\nand possibly some additional atom layers to come closer to a\nrepresentation of bulk electrodes. The dynamic atoms are a\nrelevant subset of the device atoms for which we determine\nthe vibrations. (b) In the transport setup we apply the Transiesta scheme where the central region D is coupled to fully\natomistic semi-infinite electrodes via self-energies, thereby removing periodicity along the transport direction (the periodic\nBCs are retained in the transverse plane).\n\nII.\n\nELECTRONIC STRUCTURE METHODS\n\nIn this section we describe our first-principles method\nto obtain a Hamiltonian description of a vibrating\natomic-scale device bridging to two metallic contacts.\nThe framework is the Density Functional Theory (DFT)\nand its numerical implementation in the computer code\nSiesta.44\n\nVibrational Hamiltonian\n\nThe physical situations which we typically want to describe can schematically be represented as a central device region D which is coupled to semi-infinite electrodes\nto the left (L) and right (R).

The generalization to include spin-polarization is straightforward.\nThe Hamiltonian Eq. (1) naturally arises from the\nadiabatic approximation of Born-Oppenheimer in which\nthe timescales of electronic and vibrational dynamics\nare separated.12 Since the electrons move on a much\nshorter timescale than the heavy nuclei, the adiabatic\napproximation states that the electronic Hamiltonian depends parametrically on the nuclear coordinates, i.e.,\nbe = H\nb e (Q) where Q \u2261 R \u2212 R0 is a displacement\nthat H\nvariable around the equilibrium configuration R0 .

Imposing a transformation into\nnormal mode coordinates (and the usual canonical quantization of position and momentum operators) we can\nrewrite Eq. (2) into\nbe \u2248 H\nb e0 +\nH\n\nA.\n\nX\n\nX \u2202H\nbe\n\u2202QI\u03bd\nI\u03bd\n\nQ=0\n\nX\n\u03bb\n\nv\u03bbI\u03bd\n\nr\n\n~\n(bb\u2020 + bb\u03bb ),\n2MI \u03c9\u03bb \u03bb\n\n(3)\n\nwhere MI is the mass of ion I and v\u03bb = {v\u03bbI\u03bd } is the ionic\ndisplacement vector of normal mode \u03bb with frequency \u03c9\u03bb\nnormalized according to v\u03bb * v\u03bb = 1.

The core\nelectrons are described with pseudopotentials.\nThe main reason why Siesta is particularly suitable\nstarting point for transport calculations is that the valence electrons are described in a localized basis set that\nallows for an unambiguous partitioning of the system into\nleads and device, cf. Fig. 1(b), thereby making it possible to calculate the flux of electrons (the necessity of\nthis partitioning for transport calculations is discussed\nfurther in Sec. III). The basis orbitals {|ii} are strictly\nlocalized approximations to atomic orbitals with a given\ncutoff radius and centered at the positions of the nuclei of\nthe structure. Importantly, this local electronic basis is\nnonorthogonal with overlap matrix elements Sij = hi|ji.\nIn this tight-binding like basis we use the Kohn-Sham\nHamiltonian from Siesta as the mean-field Hamiltonian\nin Eq. (1b). We initially construct a periodic supercell\n[Fig. 1(a)], and use it as an approximation to the full\ntransport setup [Fig. 1(b)] for relaxing the device atoms,\nand to obtain vibrational frequencies and e-ph couplings.\nWe note that this step leads to a determination of the\nquantities in equilibrium. In principle, these could also\nbe calculated under nonequilibrium conditions by retaining the full transport structure of Fig. 1(b). Recently,\nSergueev et al. showed this to be important for relatively\nhigh voltages (eV \u226b ~\u03c9\u03bb ).69 However, for the low-bias\nregime considered in this paper the equilibrium calculation is sufficient.\nA fairly accurate relaxation is an important prerequisite for the subsequent calculation of vibrational modes.\n\nThe atoms in the device region are therefore typically\nrelaxed until the forces acting on the dynamic atoms all\nare smaller than FI\u03bd (R0 ) < Fmax = 0.02 eV/\u00c5. Compared with other error sources in the calculations little is\ngained by lowering this criteria.\nC.\n\nVibrational modes\n\nThe starting point for our description of the nuclear\nvibrations is the Born-Oppenheimer total energy surface\nE(R) (BOS) and its derivatives with respect to the nuclear coordinates. For a thorough review on phonons\nfrom DFT we refer the reader to the paper by Baroni\net al.33 From the BOS we define the matrix of interatomic\nforce constants (usually called the Hessian or dynamic\nmatrix) as\nCI\u03bd;J\u03bc \u2261\n\n\u2202 2 E(R)\n\u2202RI\u03bd \u2202RJ\u03bc\n\nR=R0\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere R \u2261 {RI } denotes the full set of nuclear coordinates, and RI \u2261 {RI\u03bd } the coordinates of nucleus I with\nmass MI (not to be confused with the e-ph coupling elements Mij\u03bb ). Within the harmonic approximation we can\nwrite the time-dependent displacement variable as\nQI (t) = RI (t) \u2212 R0I \u2261 QI ei\u03c9t .\n\n(6)\n\nInserting Eq.

The results obtained directly\nfrom Siesta are shown together with those of our scheme\n(typical/accurate) based on the correction Eq. (13). The different calculational settings are described in the text. For\ncomparison the experimentally measured values of the frequencies are also given.79,80,81 To indicate the accuracy of\nthe calculations the numerical values for the zero-frequency\nmodes (translation/rotation) are included, where negative\nvalues correspond to imaginary frequencies.\n\nIntroducing boldface notation also for matrices we can\nrewrite Eq. (8) to the following ordinary eigenvalue problem\n(\u03c9 2 1 \u2212 W)v = 0,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the mass-scaled matrix of interatomic force constants is\nCI\u03bd;J\u03bc\nWI\u03bd,J\u03bc \u2261 \u221a\n,\nMI MJ\n\n(10)\n\n\u221a\nand vI = MI QI . Thus, the vibrational frequency \u03c9\u03bb\nand mode v\u03bb = {v\u03bbI } belong to the eigensolution (\u03c9\u03bb2 , v\u03bb )\nto Eq. (9) where we normalize the vectors as v\u03bb * v\u03bb = 1.\nAtomic forces FI = {FI\u03bd } are directly obtained by\nSiesta along with the total energy calculation.44 This\nallows us to approximate the dynamic matrix by finite\ndifferences (\"frozen phonons\"), either by\n(\u00b1)\n\nC I\u03bd;J\u03bc = \u2212\n\nFI\u03bd (\u00b1QJ\u03bc ) \u2212 FI\u03bd (0)\n,\n\u00b1QJ\u03bc\n\n(11)\n\nor, numerically more accurately, by\nC I\u03bd;J\u03bc = \u2212\n\nFI\u03bd (QJ\u03bc ) \u2212 FI\u03bd (\u2212QJ\u03bc )\n,\n2QJ\u03bc\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the bar denotes the finite difference approximation.

For each of the two choices for the vibrational\nregion (as indicated with boxes) the reference calculation-\ncarried out with SZP, a 200 Ry real space grid energy cutoff,\nand 0.02 \u00c5 finite displacements-and other three separate\ncalculations (with one of the settings improved at a time)\nyield essentially the same results for the phonon energy ~\u03c9\u03bb\nversus mode index \u03bb.\n\ndetermined. Typically we use a finite displacement of the\ndynamic atoms in each spatial direction of QJ\u03bc = \u00b10.02\n\u00c5.\nWhile the Siesta calculations for C I\u03bd;J\u03bc are generally\nstraightforward, we have observed that Siesta has difficulties in estimating the change in force on the atom\nthat is being displaced. This problem relates to the socalled egg-box effect, i.e., the movement of basis orbitals\n(which follows the nuclear positions) with respect to the\nreal space integration grid.44 As a result, phonons cannot\nbe accurately obtained directly from C I\u03bd;J\u03bc . To circumvent this technicality we impose\nmomentum conservation\nP\n(in each direction \u03bd) via I \u2206FI\u03bd = 0, which then determines the diagonal elements according to\n\u001a\nI 6= J\nP C I\u03bd;J\u03bc ,\nC I\u03bd;J\u03bc =\n(13)\n\u2212 K6=I C I\u03bd;K\u03bc , I = J\n\nwhere the K-sum runs over all atoms in the supercell. Finally, since \u2202 2 E/\u2202RI\u03bd \u2202RJ\u03bc = \u2202 2 E/\u2202RJ\u03bc \u2202RI\u03bd we apply\na numerical symmetrization of the force constants in the\ndynamic region. As a check we always verify that the frequencies calculated from the dynamic matrices with forward, backward, and combined displacements [Eq. (11)\nand (12)] are roughly the same, indicating that the harmonic approximation is not violated with the given displacement amplitude QJ\u03bc .\nThe eigenvalues {\u03c9\u03bb2 } corresponding to the symmetric\nmatrix W are real numbers. Some of these may however\nbecome negative leading to imaginary frequencies {\u03c9\u03bb },\nindicating that the atomic configuration R0 is in fact not\ndescribing a true energy minimum of the BOS. We shall\ndenote such imaginary phonon frequencies by negative\nvalues in Fig. 3 and 9.\n\n\f6\nA comparison between calculated and experimentally measured vibrational frequencies for some simple\nmolecules is shown in Fig. 3. Specifically we include\nboth the frequencies obtained directly with Siesta (from\nC I\u03bd;J\u03bc ) as well as those of our scheme based on the correction Eq. (13). In the calculations for the dimers the\nimportant settings correspond to either a 200 Ry cutoff for the real space grid integration and a single-zeta\nplus polarization (SZP) basis set (Siesta/typical), or a\n400 Ry cutoff and a double-zeta plus polarization (DZP)\nbasis set (accurate). For the hydrocarbon molecules the\nsettings are 200 Ry cutoff and DZP basis set. In all calculations the displacement amplitude is QJ\u03bc = 0.02 \u00c5.\nThe figure illustrates that our scheme presented above\nleads to a quite accurate description of the vibrational\nfrequencies. We thus see no need to resort to a frequency scaling which is sometimes invoked in DFT calculations. Further, the figure shows that the use of\nmomentum conservation for correcting elements in the\nSiesta dynamic matrix improves the calculation, in particular the determination of low frequency modes (including the zero-frequency rotation/translation modes of\nisolated molecules).\nAs an illustration of the convergence of the phonon\nenergies with respect to some important DFT settings for\nlarger systems, we show in Fig. 4 the calculated phonon\nenergies for two different sizes of the dynamic region of\na four atom gold wire (shown in the insets). We obtain\nalmost identical frequencies by increasing the real space\nintegration grid cutoff from 200 Ry to 300 Ry, by using a\nDZP basis set instead of a SZP, or by changing the finite\ndisplacements QJ\u03bc from 0.02 \u00c5 to 0.01 \u00c5. We expect the\noverall accuracy of these calculations to be representative\nnot only for isolated molecules but also for larger periodic\nsystems as well as systems involving other elements.\n\nD.\n\nhi|\n\nkl\n\n\u2212\n\n(17)\n\nThe finite difference approximation to the first term in\nEq.

The\ne-ph interaction is treated with diagrammatic perturbation theory. Below we describe the SCBA as well as\nfurther approximations leading to the computationally\ninexpensive LOE scheme. In addition, we discuss local\nheating effects and how various broadening mechanisms\nof the inelastic signal are addressed.\nA.\n\nSystem partitioning\n\nThe physical system of interest sketched in Fig. 1(b) is\ninfinite and non-periodic. For this setup let us initially\nconsider the electronic and vibronic problems separately\nand return later to the treatment of their mutual interaction.\nThe use of a local basis in Siesta allows us to parti0\ntion the (bare) electronic Hamiltonian H \u2261 {{Hij\n}} and\noverlap matrix S \u2261 {{Sij }} into\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nHL HLD\n0\n(19)\nH = \uf8ed HDL HD HDR \uf8f8 ,\n0 HRD HR\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nSL SLD 0\n(20)\nS = \uf8ed SDL SD SDR \uf8f8 ,\n0 SRD SR\n\nin which the direct couplings and overlaps between leads\nL and R are strictly zero (provided that the central region\nis sufficiently large).\nIn a similar fashion, since interatomic forces are short\nranged, the mass scaled dynamic matrix W [Eq. (5)] can\nbe partitioned into\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nWL WLD\n0\nW = \uf8ed WDL WD WDR \uf8f8 ,\n(21)\n0\nWRD WR\nwhere the direct coupling between leads L and R is neglected.\nThe infinite dimensionality of the electronic and vibrational problem can effectively be addressed with the use\nof Green's function techniques. For the electronic part\nwe define the retarded electronic single-particle Green's\nfunction G0,r (\u03b5) as the inverse of [(\u03b5 + i\u03b7)S \u2212 H] where\n\u03b7 = 0+ . It is then possible to write its representation in\nthe device region D as\nr\nr\n\u22121\nG0,r\n, (22)\nD (\u03b5) = [(\u03b5 + i\u03b7)SD \u2212 HD \u2212 \u03a3L (\u03b5) \u2212 \u03a3R (\u03b5)]\n\nwhere the self-energy due to the coupling to the left lead\nr\nis \u03a3rL (\u03b5) = (HDL \u2212 \u03b5SDL )gL\n(\u03b5)(HLD \u2212 \u03b5SLD ) and simr\nilarly for the right lead. Here, g\u03b1\n(\u03b5) is the retarded electronic \"surface\" Green's function of lead \u03b1 = L, R which\ncan be calculated effectively for periodic structures by\nrecursive techniques.86 The quantities \u03a3r\u03b1 (\u03b5) are directly\navailable from Transiesta.26 Note that Green's functions calculated without the e-ph interaction are denoted\nwith a superscript \"0\".\n\nSimilarly, for the vibrational part we can define the\nretarded phonon Green's function D0,r (\u03c9) as the inverse\nof [(\u03c9 + i\u03b7)2 1 \u2212 W], and write its representation in the\ndevice region D as\n2\nr\nr\n\u22121\nD0,r\n,\nD (\u03c9) = [(\u03c9 + i\u03b7) 1 \u2212 WD \u2212 \u03a0L (\u03c9) \u2212 \u03a0R (\u03c9)]\n(23)\n\nwhere the self-energies due to the coupling to the left\nand right regions are \u03a0rL (\u03c9) = WDL drL (\u03c9)WLD and\n\u03a0rR (\u03c9) = WDR drR (\u03c9)WRD , respectively. Here, dr\u03b1 (\u03c9)\nis the retarded phonon \"surface\" Green's function which\nagain can be calculated by the recursion techniques mentioned above.\nNote that the boldface matrix notation used for both\nelectronic and vibrational quantities refers to different\nvector spaces: Indices in the electronic case refer to the\nbasis orbitals and in the phonon case to real space coordinates. In addition, the electronic problem is treated\ndirectly in a nonorthogonal basis. The validity of the\nnonorthogonal formulation has been discussed for the\nelastic scattering problem in Refs. 87,88 and more recently including interactions in Ref. 89.\nSince we are interested in the interaction of the\nelectronic current with vibrations localized in the device region, we invoke the ansatz that-to a first\napproximation-we can disregard the phonon lead selfenergies \u03a0r\u03b1 (\u03c9) and only describe the device region by\n2\n\u22121\nD0,r\n,\nD (\u03c9) \u2248 [(\u03c9 + i\u03b7) 1 \u2212 WD ]\n\n(24)\n\nwhich in terms of the eigensolutions (\u03c9\u03bb2 , v\u03bb ) to Eq.

For weak\ne-ph coupling we thus approximate the mode occupation\nhn\u03bb i by the steady-state solution to a rate equation de-\n\n(42)\n\nwhere nB (\u03b5) = 1/[exp(\u03b5/kB T ) \u2212 1] is the Bose-Einstein\ndistribution, p\u03bb the power dissipated into mode \u03bb by the\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nelectrons, and \u03b3damp\n= 1/\u03c4ph\na damping parameter related to the average lifetime of the phonon, e.g., by coupling to bulk vibrations.\nIn steady state the power transferred by electrons from\nthe leads into to the device must balance the power transferred from the device electrons to the phonons, i.e.,\nX\nPL + PR =\np\u03bb .\n(43)\n\u03bb\n\nFrom the particle conservation condition90\n\n>\n<\n>\nTr[\u03a3<\ntot (\u03b5)GD (\u03b5) \u2212 \u03a3tot (\u03b5)GD (\u03b5)] = 0,\n\nwe can define the quantity p\u03bb as\nZ\n1 \u221e d\u03b5\n\u03b5\np\u03bb \u2261 \u2212\n~ \u2212\u221e 2\u03c0\n\n(44)\n\n(45)\n\n>\n>\n<\n\u00d7Tr[\u03a3<\nph,\u03bb (\u03b5)GD (\u03b5) \u2212 \u03a3ph,\u03bb (\u03b5)GD (\u03b5)],\n\nwhich consequently obeys Eq. (43). We note that in this\nway we basically\ndefine 3N quantities from a single equaP\ntion for \u03bb p\u03bb only; different definitions could in principle also fulfill the power balance. However, to lowest\norder in the e-ph coupling our definition Eq. (45) is unambiguously the power transferred to mode \u03bb.\nFrom Eq. (42) we can identify two regimes, (i) the ex\u03bb\nternally damped limit (\u03b3damp\nmuch larger than electron\u03bb\nhole (e-h) pair damping \u03b3e-h\n) where the populations\nare fixed according to the Bose-Einstein distribution\nhn\u03bb i = nB (~\u03c9\u03bb ), and (ii) the externally undamped limit\n\u03bb\n(\u03b3damp\n= 0 and hence from Eq. (42) that p\u03bb = 0) where\nthe populations vary with bias such that no power is dissipated in the device, i.e., PL + PR = 0. It is instructive\nto note that p\u03bb includes both phonon emission and absorption processes, which is the reason why a steady-state\nsolution always exists.\nA typical situation that come close to the externally\nundamped limit is when the device vibrations fall outside the phonon band of the bulk electrodes, i.e., when\nthere is a significant mass difference between the device\natoms and the electrode atoms. In this case the vibrations cannot couple directly (resonantly) to the bulk, and\nthe damping, e.g., by anharmonic means, is likely to be\nmuch smaller than the coupling to the electrons. One\nimportant example is the hydrogen molecule clamped between platinum contacts.16,18\nTo solve the SCBA equations Eqs. (38)\u2013(42), we have\ndeveloped an implementation in the programming language Python where the Green's functions and selfenergies are sampled on a finite energy grid. The main\ntechnical challenges are discussed in App. B. Finally we\nnote that with the phonon self-energies Eqs. (38)\u2013(39)\nthe current is conserved. This can be proven using the\nidentity Eq. (44).90\n\n\f10\nE.\n\nLowest order expansion\n\nThe solution of the SCBA equations is a daunting numerical task for systems consisting of more than a handful of atoms. However, for systems where the e-ph coupling is weak and the density of states (DOS) varies\nslowly with energy, we have previously derived the LOE\napproximation.45 Here we elaborate on these results.\nThe main computational burden of the SCBA originates from the numerical integration over energy needed\nin the evaluation of the current and power expressions\nEqs. (31)\u2013(32). The LOE approximation assumes that\nthe retarded and advanced single-particle Green's func0,r/a\nr/a\ntions GD\nand lead self-energies \u03a3\u03b1 are energy independent. We can then expand the current and power\nexpressions to the lowest order (second) in e-ph couplings M\u03bb and perform the energy integrations analytically. These integrals consist of products of Fermi-Dirac\nfunctions and their Hilbert transforms. The LOE thus\nretains the Pauli exclusion principle for fermionic particles, which is necessary to model the blocking of phonon\nemission processes at low bias.\nIn the LOE approximation, the total power dissipated\ninto the phonon system P LOE \u2261 PL + PR can, after\nlengthy derivations, be written as45\nX\nP LOE =\npLOE\n,\n(46)\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\n\b\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n+ \u03b3em\n(V, T ) , (47)\npLOE\n= ~\u03c9\u03bb [nB (~\u03c9\u03bb ) \u2212 hn\u03bb i]\u03b3e-h\n\u03bb\n\u0002\n\u0003\n~\u03c9\u03bb\n\u03bb\nTr M\u03bb AM\u03bb A ,\n(48)\n\u03b3e-h\n=\n\u03c0~\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n~\u03c9\u03bb\neV\neV\n\u22121]\ncoth\n\u2212\neV\nsinh\n~\u03c9\n[cosh\n\u03bb\nk\nT\n2k\nT\nk\nT\n\u03bb\nB\nB\nB\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03b3em\n=\neV\n\u03bb\n\u2212\ncosh\n]\n\u03c0~[cosh k~\u03c9\nT\nk\nT\nB\nB\n\u0003\n\u0002\n(49)\n\u00d7Tr M\u03bb AL M\u03bb AR ,\n\nwhere the Bose-Einstein distribution nB (\u03b5) appears in\nEq.

(46)\u2013\n(52) consider the following arguments: The energy phase\nspace available for phonon emission and absorption processes is limited by the Pauli principle, as sketched in\nFig. 6. We divide the electronic phase space in two, corresponding to scattering states incoming from either the\nleft or the right contact. Without e-ph scattering these\nstates are assumed to be populated up to the Fermi level\n\u03b5F (we take \u03bcL > \u03bcR + ~\u03c9\u03bb and kB T \u2192 0). Within\nthis picture phonon emission can only take place from\na populated state originating in the left contact to an\nempty state originating in the right contact, see Fig. 6(a).\nSimilarly, phonon absorption can be described by three\ndifferent processes sketched in Fig. 6(b)\u2013(d), again corresponding to scattering from populated initial states to\nempty final states.\nThe scattering rates for these processes are proportional to the energy window in which they can take place.\nDenoting the scattering rate per energy as d\u03b3\u03b1\u03b1\u2032 /d\u03b5,\nwhere \u03b1 = L, R (\u03b1\u2032 = L, R) indicates the propagation\n\n\f11\ndirection of the initial (final) scattering state, we can\nwrite the spontaneous plus stimulated emission power as\npLOE\n\u03bb,em = ~\u03c9\u03bb (hn\u03bb i + 1) (eV \u2212 ~\u03c9\u03bb ) d\u03b3LR /d\u03b5 and the absorption power as pLOE\n\u03bb,ab = ~\u03c9\u03bb hn\u03bb i[(eV + ~\u03c9\u03bb ) d\u03b3LR /d\u03b5\n+~\u03c9\u03bb (d\u03b3LL /d\u03b5 + d\u03b3RR /d\u03b5)].

(52) is directly motivated by equating Eq. (53) to zero (steady state) and by\nignoring scattering processes with initial and final states\npropagating in the same direction (d\u03b3\u03b1\u03b1 /d\u03b5). In addition, a steady-state solution to Eq. (42) always exists\nbecause the phonon emission rate is always smaller than\nthe total phonon absorption rate, and that emission processes are restricted to a smaller energy window than\nabsorption processes.\nThe LOE approximation, which above was applied to\nthe power, also allows us to write the current through\nthe device I LOE as45,46\n\n\u0003\n\u0002\nI LOE = G0 V Tr G\u0393R G\u2020 \u0393L\n\u001b\u0015\n\u0014\n\u001a\nX sym\n\u0001\ni\n\u0393R G\u2020 M\u03bb AM\u03bb \u2212 h.c.\n+\nI\u03bb (V, T, hn\u03bb i) Tr G\u2020 \u0393L G M\u03bb AR M\u03bb +\n2\n\u03bb\nX asym\n\u0002\n\b\n\u0003\n+\nI\u03bb (V, T ) Tr G\u2020 \u0393L G \u0393R G\u2020 M\u03bb (AR \u2212 AL ) M\u03bb + h.c. ,\n\u03bb\n\nI\u03bbsym\n\ne\n=\n\u03c0~\n\nI\u03bbasym =\n\ne\n~\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n2eV hn\u03bb i +\n\n~\u03c9\u03bb \u2212 eV\n\ne\n\n~\u03c9\u03bb \u2212eV\nkB T\n\n\u22121\n\n\u2212\n\n~\u03c9\u03bb + eV\n\ne\n\n~\u03c9\u03bb +eV\nkB T\n\n\u22121\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(55)\n\nd\u03b5\n[nF (\u03b5) \u2212 nF (\u03b5 \u2212 eV )] H\u03b5\u2032 {nF (\u03b5\u2032 + ~\u03c9\u03bb ) \u2212 nF (\u03b5\u2032 \u2212 ~\u03c9\u03bb )}(\u03b5),\n2\u03c0\n\nwhere the bias is defined via eV = \u03bcR \u2212 \u03bcL , and G0 =\n2e2 /h is the spin-degenerate conductance quantum. This\nexpression is current conserving, i.e., calculating the current at the left and right contacts give the same result.\nThe LOE expression for the current Eq. (54) contains three terms, (i) the Landauer-B\u00fcttiker term corresponding to the elastic conductance, (ii) the \"symmetric\" term corresponding to symmetric conductance steps\nat the vibrational energies, and (iii) the \"asymmetric\"\nterm corresponding to peaks and dips in the conductance which are asymmetric with voltage inversion, see\nFig. 7. For geometrically symmetric junctions, it can be\nshown that the asymmetric term vanishes exactly. Even\nfor geometrically asymmetric systems we typically find\nthat it is a very small contribution compared with the\nsymmetric term. Furthermore, the sign of the conductance step for the symmetric term in general shows an\nincrease (decrease) in the conductance for low (high) conducting systems, e.g., vibrations usually help electrons\nthrough molecules while they backscatter electrons in\natomic wires. This is discussed further for a one-level\nmodel in Ref. 96.\nThe LOE approximation is computationally simple\n\n(54)\n\n(56)\n\nand can be applied to systems of considerable size. Although the approximation is not strictly valid for systems\nwith energy-dependent DOS, comparison with the full\nSCBA calculations shows good agreement even for systems that have a slowly varying DOS (on the scale of vibrational energies), e.g., the organic molecules connected\nto gold electrodes described below in Sec. V. The LOE\napproximation will certainly fail when sharp resonances\n(compared to the vibrational energies) are present within\nthe order of phonon energies of the Fermi energy. However, in this case Coulomb blockade physics is also expected, which thus makes any DFT mean-field approach\n(including ours) questionable.\n\nF.\n\nBroadening mechanisms\n\nThe width of the experimentally measured phonon signal in the conductance is a combination of (at least) three\nbroadening mechanisms, namely the intrinsic ones from a\nfinite temperature and a finite phonon lifetime, as well as\nthe one related to the modulation voltage used in lock-\n\n\f12\nsym\n\nasym\n\nI\n\nI\n\n0\n\ndI/dV\n\ndI/dV\n\na\nb\nc\n\n0\n\n2\n2\n\n0\n\nd I/dV\n\n0\n\n2\n\nd I/dV\n\n2\n\nfwhm = 5.4 kT\n\n-2\n\n-1\n0\n1\nBias voltage V/h\u03c9\u03bb\n\n2\n\n-2\n\n-1\n0\n1\nBias voltage V/h\u03c9\u03bb\n\n2\n\nFIG. 7: (Color online) Universal functions Eq.

These contributions do not add up trivially.\nHowever, as we show below, one can provide estimates\nfor each of the different contributions which thus help to\nunderstand what effect is the dominant one.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 7, the electronic temperature\ngives rise to a broadening of the vibrational signal. From\nEq. (55) the full width half max (FWHM) in the second\nderivative of the current can be shown to be approximately 5.4 kB T .45,97,98\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nThe effects of a finite phonon lifetime \u03c4ph\n= 1/\u03b3damp\nis\nto a first approximation described by a convolution of the\nfree phonon Green's functions with a Lorentzian with a\n\u03bb\nHWHM width of ~\u03b3damp\n. Consequently, this convolution\npropagates to the phonon self-energies Eq. (38) and to the\ninelastic LOE corrections to the current, cf. Eq. (55) and\n(56). The FWHM broadening in the second derivative\nof the current is thus 2~\u03b3damp. The intrinsic linewidth\nof the phonon signal has also been discussed in a simple\nSCBA model by Galperin et al.99\nThe broadening from the lock-in technique for measurements of the first or second derivatives of the current\ncan be estimated in the following way. With a small\n\u221a harmonic modulation signal (with amplitude A = 2 Vrms )\napplied on top of the bias voltage one can measure derivatives of the current. As shown in App. C the FWHM\nwidth induced by the lock-in measurement technique is\n2.45 Vrms and 1.72 Vrms for the first and second derivatives\n\nFIG. 8: (Color online) Generic gold wire supercells containing\n3 to 7 atoms bridging pyramidal bases connected to stacked\nAu(100) layers. As indicated on the figure, the electrode separation L is defined as the distance between the plane in each\nelectrode containing the second-outermost Au(100) layer.\n\nof the current, respectively (neglecting intrinsic broadening). In other words, if d2 I/dV 2 is a \u03b4-function, the\nexperimentally measured FWHM width will be either\n2.45 Vrms or 1.72 Vrms , depending on whether the lockin measurement is on the first or second harmonic.\nIV.\n\nATOMIC GOLD WIRES\n\nSince the discovery in the late 1990s that gold can\nform free-standing wires of single atoms100,101,102,103\nthe mechanical, chemical, and electrical properties of these atomic-scale systems have been extensively\nstudied.15,48,78,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,1\nFor this reason we illustrate in this section our method\ndescribed in Sec. II and III by applying it to model\ninelastic scattering in atomic gold wires. We compare\ndirectly the results of our theoretical developments with\nthe high-quality experimental data by Agra\u0131\u0308t and coworkers.15,117 They used a cryogenic STM to first create\nan atomic gold wire between the tip and the substrate\nsurface, and then to measure the conductance against\nthe displacement of the tip. From the length of the\nobserved conductance plateau around G0 -the signature\nthat an atomic wire has been formed-it was possible\nto determine the approximate size as well as the level of\nstrain of the created wire. Under these conditions Agra\u0131\u0308t\net al. then used point-contact spectroscopy to show that\nthe conductance of an atomic gold wire decreases a\nfew percent around a particular tip-substrate voltage\n(symmetric around zero bias) presumably coinciding\nwith the natural frequency of a certain vibrational mode\nof the wire. With this inelastic spectroscopy method\nthey could further characterize the conductance drop as\na function of wire length and strain.\nTo simulate these experiments, we study wires containing different number of atoms and under varying stretching conditions. The generic supercells used in the Siesta\ncalculations are illustrated in Fig. 8 and consist of 3\nto 7 gold atoms bridging pyramidal bases connected to\nstacked Au(100) layers. We use a 4 \u00d7 4 supercell size in\nthe plane transverse to the transport direction and define\n\n\fdEKS/dL [eV/\u00c5]\n\n4-atom\n3-atom\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n\nBond angles [deg]\n\nFor a given electrode separation L the first calculational step is to relax the geometry to obtain a local\nenergy minimum configuration R0 . With the settings\ndescribed above we relax both the outermost electrode\nlayers, the pyramidal bases, and the wire atoms until\nall forces acting each of these atoms are smaller than\nFmax = 0.02 eV/\u00c5.\nFigure 9(a) shows the relative differences in the KohnSham total energy (cohesive energy) as the wires are elongated. We also show the numerical derivatives of these\nbinding energy curves as a measure of the forces acting\non the wire. The breaking force, defined as the energy\nslope of the last segment before breaking, is found be of\nthe order 1 eV/\u00c5 \u223c 1.6 nN. This agrees well with the\nexperimental results which have shown the break force\nfor atomic gold wires to be close to 1.5 nN.4,111,112\nIn Fig. 9(b) we summarize the geometrical findings\nof the relaxation procedure by plotting the wire bond\nlengths and bond angles as a function of electrode separation L. The figure shows that the short wires containing\n3 or 4 atoms adopt a linear structure over a wide range\nof electrode separations. The longer wires, on the other\nhand, are generally found to have a zigzag geometry only\napproaching a linear form when they are stretched close\nto the breaking point.105\nFrom the plot of the bond lengths between nearest\nneighbors in the wire one notices that the 4 and 6 atom\nwires have a more pronounced tendency to dimerize than\nthe wires with an odd number (due to left/right symmetry of the structures only wires with an even number of\natoms should be able to dimerize). In three test calculations with a 3\u00d73\u00d73 k-point sampling of the three dimensional Brillouin zone we generally achieve very similar\natomic arrangements as compared to the \u0393-point only.\n\n6-atom 7-atom\n\n5-atom\n\n1.5\n\nBond lengths [\u00c5]\n\nGeometry relaxation\n\n(a)\n\n16\n\n3.4\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\n(b)\n\n160\n140\n120\n3.2\n3\n2.8\n2.6\n16\n\nPhonon energy [meV]\n\nA.\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n\n180\n\n20\n\n(c)\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n\nTransmission T(E=EF)\n\nthe electrode separation L, as indicated on Fig. 8, as the\ndistance between the plane in each electrode containing\nthe second-outermost Au(100) layer.

The interaction between the valence electrons and the ionic cores are described by a standard norm-conserving Troullier-Martins\npseudopotential124 generated from a relativistic atomic\ncalculation (including core correction).

As indicated on the\nfigure the vibrational region is taken to include the atoms in\nthe pyramidal bases and the wire itself, whereas the device\nregion (describing the e-ph couplings) includes also the outermost surface layers.\n\nHowever, these calculations, which are indicated with\nblack crosses in Fig. 9(b), seem to reduce the dimerization tendency somewhat.\n\nB.\n\nVibrational analysis\n\nWe calculate the vibrational frequencies and modes as\ndescribed in Sec. II C. With N vibrating atoms we thus\nfind 3N modes for a given structure. The phonon spectrum for the wire is plotted in Fig. 9(c), where negative\nvalues indicate modes with imaginary frequency implying\nthe breaking of an unstable wire. The general trend is\nthat the phonon energies diminish as the wires are elongated. This can be understood by considering that the\neffective \"springs\" between ions in the wires are softened\nas the bonds are stretched, which in turn result in lower\nenergies.\nIn the results to follow we generally take the wire and\npyramidal base atoms as the dynamic region (as indicated in Fig. 10), i.e. these atoms are allowed to vibrate.\nFor the 3- to 7-atom wires this leave us with 33 to 45 vibrational modes. The corresponding e-ph couplings are\ncalculated in a slightly larger device region containing\nalso the outermost surface layer. This inclusion of an\nextra layer is necessary to represent the vibrational modulation of the hopping between the pyramidal base atoms\nand the first surface layers.\n\nC.\n\nElastic transmission\n\nIn order to determine the transport properties of the\nwire geometries described above, we construct from the\nsupercells shown in Fig. 8 new wire geometries which\nare coupled to semi-infinite electrodes as schematically\nillustrated in Fig. 1(b). The resulting setup is shown in\nFig. 10 for the case of a 7-atom long gold wire. As indicated on this figure we consider the device subspace to\ninclude the top-most surface layer, the pyramidal bases,\nand the wire itself.\n\nThe elastic transmission evaluated at the Fermi energy\n\u03b5F is calculated using Transiesta described in Ref. 26.\nThe results are shown in Fig. 9(d) both for the \u0393-point\n(open symbols) as well as with a 5 \u00d7 5 k-point sampling\nof the two-dimensional Brillouin zone perpendicular to\nthe transport direction (black stars). In correspondence\nwith previous work, e.g., Refs. 87,104,107,118, we find\nthat the total transmission is close to unity, except for\nthe very stretched configurations where the transmission\ngoes down somewhat. From Fig. 9(d) one observes a reasonable agreement between the \u0393-point and the k-point\nsampled transmissions, particularly when the transmission is close to one. Worst are the discrepancies for the 4\nand 6 atom wires, which also are the cases where the\ntransmission deviates most from unity. We subscribe\nthese signatures to the so-called odd-even behavior in\nthe conductance of metallic atomic wires, in which perfect transmission is expected only for an odd number of\natoms in a chain. For an even number of atoms the conductance should be lower.4 Further, the observed dimerization is also expected to reduce the conductance (the\nPeierls instability for infinite metallic wires results in the\nopening of a band gap at the Fermi energy). We also note\nthat on an energy scale of the typical phonon energies the\ntransmission function is to a very good approximation a\nconstant around the Fermi energy.\n\nD.\n\nInelastic transport\n\nHaving determined the vibrational frequencies, the eph couplings, and the elastic transmission properties, we\nare in position to calculate the inelastic current as described in Sec. III B.\nWe start out by showing that the LOE and SCBA approaches essentially predict the same inelastic signals for\natomic gold wires, thereby reducing the computational\nexpense in the detailed analysis to follow. For this purpose only we consider a computationally reduced problem\nwhere the device and dynamic atoms regions are minimized as compared with those generally adopted in this\nsection. We will thus simply allow the wire atoms to vibrate and take the device space as the wire plus pyramidal bases only. Compared with the electronic structure\nand phonon energies the thermal energy typically sets\nthe smallest energy scale for variations in the Green's\nfunctions etc. Instead of using the experimentally relevant temperature of T = 4.2 K (or even less) we further\nsimplify the calculations by taking T = 10.0 K for the\nmoment since this requires fewer points on the energy\ngrid, cf. App. B.\nThe differential conductances as resulting from evaluating Eq. (31) with and without SCBA phonon selfenergies as well as evaluating the LOE expression\nEq. (54) are shown in Fig. 11. The dotted curve is the\npurely elastic result (no phonon self-energy) and the circles the full SCBA (including all vibrational modes in\nthe externally damped limit \u03b3damp \u226b \u03b3e-h of Sec. III D).\n\n\f15\n0.994\n\nG [G0]\n\n0.992\n0.99\n0.988\nElastic\nSCBA\nLOE\nSCBA (elastic subtr.)\n\n0.986\n0.984\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n0\n10\nBias voltage [meV]\n\n20\n\n30\n\nFIG. 11: (Color online) Elastic and inelastic differential conductance calculated at T = 10.0 K in a reduced device region\nfor the 7-atom wire shown in Fig. 10. The small variation in\nelastic conductance with bias (dotted curve) relates to a weak\nenergy dependence of the elastic transmission function at the\n\u0393-point around \u03b5F . The full SCBA calculation (circles) follows\nthis trend and shows on top of it symmetric drops characteristic for phonon scattering. The LOE calculation (line) does\nnot include the elastic variation but gives basically the same\npredictions for the inelastic signals as the SCBA with the elastic background signal subtracted (dashed curve). This illustrates the agreement between the LOE and SCBA approaches\nfor the inelastic contribution.\n\nThe red line corresponds to the LOE. The elastic conductance displays a slight variation with bias that relates\nto the weak energy dependence in the zero-bias transmission function at the \u0393-point. The full SCBA calculation clearly shows two symmetric conductance drops\nwhich are due to inelastic scattering against vibrations\n(we will return later to a discussion of the physics). The\nLOE calculation does not include the elastic variation\nbut gives basically the same predictions for the inelastic signals. This is clear from a comparison with the\nSCBA where the elastic background signal has been subtracted (dashed curve). Based on a number of such tests,\nand the fact that the e-ph couplings are weak (or more\nprecisely, that the inelastic signal is a small change in\nconductance of the order 1-2 %), we conclude that the\napproximations leading to the LOE expressions are valid\nin the case of atomic gold wires. To appreciate this fact,\nwe note that the SCBA curves in Fig. 11 required approximately 40 CPU-hours in a parallel job running on 4\nprocessors whereas the LOE results only required a few\nseconds on one processor. The LOE approach is thus\njustified for a full analysis of the 3- to 7-atom gold wires.\nFigure 12 shows the calculated differential conductance\nof the 3- to 7-atom wires under different electrode separations L and in the externally damped limit. The device region and dynamic atoms are here as indicated in\nFig. 10, and the temperature of the leads is T = 4.2 K.\nThe curves display symmetric drops at voltages corresponding to particular phonon energies. The dominant\ninelastic signal moves towards lower energies and increase\n\nin magnitude as the wires are elongated. Furthermore,\nsometimes also a secondary feature is found below 5 meV,\ne.g., Figs. 11 and 12. These observations are also characteristic for the experiments,15,117 and in agreement with\nprevious calculations.46,78\nTo extract the general trends on how the inelastic signal depends on details in the atomic arrangement we\npresent in Fig. 13 our calculated data in different forms.\nIn these plots we represent each phonon mode by a dot\nwith an area proportional to the corresponding conductance drop. The abscissa corresponds to the electrode\nseparation whereas the ordinate is used to highlight certain properties of the vibrational modes. In this way,\nFig. 13(a) illustrates the mode frequency change with\nelectrode separation. From a linear fit to the strongest\nsignals we predict a frequency shift of \u22128.45 meV/\u00c5 for\nthe 5-atom wire falling off to \u22126.34 meV/\u00c5 for the 7atom long wire. Further, to understand the nature of\nthe modes that influence the electronic transport we can\ntry to quantify some important characteristics. As it has\npreviously been shown, longitudinal modes with an alternating bond length (ABL) character are expected to\nbe the dominating ones.15,78,125 To measure the longitudinal part of a given vibrational\nmode v\u03bb we define\nP\na sum over z-components I (v\u03bbIz )2 \u2264 1 where I runs\nover all dynamic atoms (the upper bound is due to the\neigenmodes normalization v\u03bb * v\u03bb = 1). This quantity is\nshown in Fig. 13(b). The plot clearly expresses that the\nmodes with the largest signals (large dot area) also have\na strong longitudinal component. Further, to show that\ntheseP\nmodes also have ABL character, we also define a\nsum I>J |v\u03bbIz \u2212 v\u03bbJz | where I and J are nearest neighbor atoms in the chain. This second quantity is shown\nin Fig. 13(c), from which we learn that the important\nmodes also have the largest ABL measure (the absolute\nscale is irrelevant).\nAnother important aspect is whether the modes are\nreally localized in the wire or not. Remember that our\napproach assumes that atoms outside the dynamic region\nare fixed. Therefore, if we have eigenvectors with significant amplitude near the boundary of the dynamic region,\nthis assumption does not seem to be valid (most likely the\neigenvector is not a true eigenvector of the real system).\nIn other words, we want to make sure that the modes\nwhich are responsible for the inelastic scattering are sufficiently localized \"deep\"\nP inside the dynamic region. To\nshow this we calculate I vI\u03bb * vI\u03bb \u2264 1 where I runs over\nthe 3 to 7 wire atoms. This quantity is represented in\nFig. 13(d) and confirms that indeed the important modes\nare localized in the chain; particularly for the 5-, 6-, and\n7-atom wires the localization is almost perfect.\nIn conclusion, from the results presented in Fig. 13, we\nlearn that the inelastic signal in the conductance is effectively described by a simple selection rule in which longitudinal vibrational modes with ABL mode character-\nlocalized in the wire-are the main cause of the inelastic\nscattering. We are further able to quantify the frequency\ndown-shift and signal increase with strain.\n\n\f16\n\n3-atom\n0.96\n\n(a)\n18.00\u00c5\n\n1\n\n4-atom\n\nG [G0]\n\n18.60\u00c5\n\n(c)\n\n20.20\u00c5\n1\n\n0.95\n0.94\n\n18.40\u00c5\n\n(b)\n\n5-atom\n\n20.80\u00c5\n\n0.93\n21.00\u00c5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n-30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30\n\n(d)\n\n26.00\u00c5\n\n0.96\n0.99\n\n0.98\n\n0.91\n\ndG/dV [G0/V]\n\n0.98\n23.30\u00c5\n\n23.70\u00c5\n\n0.92\n\n0.99\n\n6-atom\n\n7-atom\n1\n0.99\n\n26.40\u00c5\n0.94\n\n0.98\n\n0.92\n\n0.97\n\n(e)\n\n28.60\u00c5\n29.20\u00c5\n\n29.80\u00c5\n\n26.80\u00c5\n\n24.10\u00c5\n0.9\n\n0.96\n\n2\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30\n\n-30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30\nBias voltage [meV]\n\n-30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30\n\n-30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30\n\nFIG. 12: (Color online) The differential conductance G and its derivative dG/dV calculated with the LOE approach for the 3to 7-atom gold wires in the externally damped limit.

The temperature of the leads is T = 4.2 K.\n\nE.\n\nVibrational lifetimes and local heating\n\nFrom Fig. 13(d) we get a hint about the damping of the\nmodes from the coupling to bulk phonons. If a mode is\nlocalized \"deep\" inside the dynamic region this coupling\nis negligible and the mode is expected to have a long\nlife-time, i.e., to be weakly damped by the coupling to\nthe bulk. As discussed in Sec. III A we can estimate this\ndamping from the width of the phonon density of states\nprojected onto the mode vector.\nAs an illustration of this approach, we calculate the\ndamping of the dominating ABL mode according to\nEq. (30) in the case of the 7-atom wire with electrode separation L = 29.20 \u00c5. This mode, shown in Fig. 14(a), has\na localization quantity (as defined above) of value 0.987,\ni.e., it is 98.7% localized in the wire. We begin by determining the dynamic matrix of the whole wire supercell\n[Fig. 8(e)] as described in Sec. II C. To describe the bulk\nproperties of gold we pick the intra-layer and inter-layer\nelements (inside the slab) in the dynamic matrix along\nthe transport direction, and use recursive techniques to\ncalculate bulk and surface phonon Green's functions. Because of periodicity in the transverse plane-which gives\nrise to artificial sharp resonances in the spectrum-we\nbroaden the phonon Green's functions by taking \u03b7 = 1.0\nmeV. This approach leads to the total phonon density\nof states (full black line) shown in the inset of Fig. 14.\nThis shape compares reasonably well with other calculations and experiments.126,127 The inset also shows the\nphonon density of states decomposed in the direction\n\nof the transport (dashed red curve) as well as in the\ntransverse directions (dotted blue curve); the observed\nisotropy that is expected for bulk is actually quite satisfactory. Finally, we calculate the projected phonon density of states B\u03bb (\u03c9) for the ABL mode of interest according to Eq. (30). This projection on a discrete energy grid\nis shown in Fig. 14 (open circles). By fitting a Lorentzian\nto the calculated data points we obtain a FWHM of 8 \u03bceV\nand a shift in frequency by \u22126 \u03bceV. Based on these calculations we thus estimate the phonon damping to be of\n\u03bb\nthe order ~\u03b3damp\n= 4 \u03bceV. In fact, this is rather a lower\nbound, since we have not included anharmonic contributions etc.61 However, compared with the phonon energy\n\u03bb\nwe see that indeed \u03b3damp\n\u226a \u03c9\u03bb , and thus that the use of\nfree phonon Green's functions in the SCBA self-energy\nEq. (38) is justified.\nLet us next investigate the implications of a finite\nphonon lifetime on the local heating. This is done by\nsolving the rate equation Eq. (42) for the mode occupation at a fixed bias voltage. For instance, the inelastic\nconductance characteristics (including heating) for our\n7-atom wire are shown in Fig. 15 for different values of\n\u03bb\nthe phonon damping \u03b3damp\n(smooth colored lines). As\nseen in the figure, and as we have shown previously,78\nthe effect of the heating is to introduce a slope in the\nconductance beyond the phonon threshold voltage. This\nis because the nonequilibrium mode occupation increases\nthe number of scattering events of the traversing electrons. Consequently the conductance goes down as the\nbias (and hence the occupation level) increases. The\n\n\f17\n\nFIG. 13: (Color online) Inelastic signals plotted as a function of the electrode separation L. Each mode is represented by a dot\nwith an area proportional to the corresponding conductance drop. On the y-axis we show (a) the phonon mode energy, (b) a\nmeasure of the longitudinal component of the mode, (c) a measure of the ABL character, and (d) a measure of the localization\nto the wire atoms only. The straight lines in plot (a) are linear interpolations to the most significant signals (the slopes are\ngiven too).\n\nsmaller the damping, the more the mode occupation is\ndriven out of equilibrium, i.e., to a larger average excita\u03bb\ntion level. In the extreme case of no damping \u03b3damp\n=0\n(dotted curve) [the externally undamped limit in Ref. 78],\nthe local heating is maximal. On the other hand, a sufficiently large damping may effectively prevent phonon\nheating [the externally damped limit in Ref. 78]. From\nFig. 15 we see that with a phonon damping as large as\n200 \u03bceV/~ the slope has vanished.\nFigure 15 also compares our theoretical results to the\noriginal experimental measurements by Agra\u0131\u0308t et al.15\n(noisy curves). The four experimental characteristics\n(aligned with the calculated zero-bias conductance) corresponds to a presumably 7-atom long gold wire under\ndifferent states of strain recorded at low temperatures\nT = 4.2 K. From this plot it is clear that theory and experiment are in excellent agreement with respect to the\nposition of the phonon signal and the magnitude of the\ndominant drop. One also notices the indication of a secondary phonon feature below 5 meV in all curves. But\nwhat is particularly interesting is that the measured conductance slopes beyond the threshold seem to agree well\n\nwith a phonon damping of the order 5-50 \u03bceV, which is\nfurther quite reasonable according to our estimate above.\nThe only feature which is not perfectly reproduced is\nthe experimental width of phonon signal lineshape-as\nseen from the derivative of the conductance dG/dV in\nthe lower part of the figure-which is somewhat wider\nthan the calculated ones (which for comparison also includes the instrumental lock-in broadening corresponding\nVrms = 1 meV).\n\nV.\n\nHYDROCARBON MOLECULES BETWEEN\nGOLD CONTACTS\n\nThe general method described in Sec. II and III is applicable to many other systems than atomic gold wires.\nExamples of systems where it is interesting to apply this\nmethod include wires and contacts of other metals as\nwell as individual molecules. In fact, we have already\nused the present method to study conjugated and saturated hydrocarbon molecules in between gold surfaces,\nsee Ref. 76.

The spectrum B\u03bb (\u03b5) corresponds to\nthe important ABL-mode for a 7-atom wire (L = 29.20\u00c5).\nBy fitting the calculated points with a Lorentzian we extract\n\u03bb\na full-width half max (FWHM) broadening of 2\u03b3damp\n= 8\u03bceV\nand a frequency shift of \u03b4\u03c9\u03bb = \u22126\u03bceV. The inset shows the\ncalculated total density of states for bulk Au (full line), as well\nas a decomposition in the direction of the transport (dashed\nred curve) and in the transverse direction (dotted blue curve).\n\nthat our method is general enough to apply to many systems; especially that the LOE approximation is likely to\nbe valid for a range of systems where, at first glance, it\nis not expected to work.\nWe start with a brief description of our previous\nresults76 motivated by the recent experiments by Kushmerick et al.20 They measured the inelastic scattering signal through three different molecules (C11, OPV, and\nOPE) connected to gold electrodes by means of a cryogenic crossed-wire tunnel junction setup.

The measured characteristics (noisy black curves)\ncorrespond to different states of strain of wire (around 7 atoms\nlong). The calculated results (smooth colored lines) are for\nthe 7-atom wire at L = 29.20 \u00c5 using different values for the\nexternal damping as indicated in the upper right corner of\nthe plot (in units of \u03bceV/~). The dashed curve is the cal\u03bb\nculated result in the externally undamped limit (\u03b3damp\n= 0).\nThe lower plot is the numerical derivative of the conductance,\nwhere the experimental curves have been offset by multiples of\nG0 /V for clarity. Note the indication of a secondary phonon\nfeature below 5 meV in all curves. The temperature is T = 4.2\nK and the lock-in modulation voltage Vrms = 1 meV (in both\ntheory and experiment).\n\n(57)\n\nwhich-if the current I simply scales with the number of\nmolecules-is independent of the number of molecules in\nthe junction.\nIn Ref. 76, we used the present LOE method to model\nthe IETS spectra for each of these three molecules. As\nan example, Fig. 16 shows the calculated and measured IETS spectrum in the case of the conjugated OPE\nmolecule [inset of Fig. 17(b)]. It is seen that our theory\nreproduces the positions and relative heights of the inelastic scattering peaks. The three main peaks are given\n\nby four types of vibrations; one type is affecting the C\u2013\nS stretch whereas the other three involve the distortion\nof the C backbone of the molecule. In our calculation\nthe region of dynamic atoms includes 54 atoms corresponding to 162 vibrational modes (18 Au surface atoms\nand 36 atoms in the molecule). We thus see that the\nIETS spectrum must be related to certain selection rules\nthat describe why only a few vibrational modes affect the\ncurrent. These selection rules may be understood from\nstudying the electron scattering states and the symmetry\nof the e-ph interaction.128 For the other two molecules\n\n\fLOE calculation\nExperimental\n\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n\nRing\n\n1\n\nOPE\n\nx2\nC-S, breathing\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n0\n1\n00\n11\n0\n1\n00\n11\n0\n1\n11\n00\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n0\n1\n00\n11\n0\n1\n00\n11\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n0.2\nBias [V]\n\nC C\n\n4\n\n-1\n\n(d I/dV )/(dI/dV) [V ]\n\n19\n\n0.3\n\nFIG. 16: (Color online) Calculated IETS spectrum for an\nOPE molecule compared to the experimental data from\nRef. 20.

Accordingly the use of the LOE approximation might seem inappropriate for these systems.\nWith a detailed comparison between LOE and full SCBA\ncalculations (including this energy dependence) we can\nnevertheless show that the LOE approximation provides\neffectively the same prediction for the IETS spectrum.\nThis comparison is found in Fig. 17.\nSince the SCBA is computationally expensive it is not\nrealistic to use the same high accuracy as for LOE calculations. We therefore reduce the device subspace and the\nregion of dynamic atoms to include only the molecule.\nFurthermore we use a smaller SZP basis set describing\nthe OPE (OPV) molecule reducing the device subspace\nto 264 (280) atomic orbitals. Finally we include only the\n5 (3) most important vibrational modes (selected from a\nLOE calculation). With these simplifications we calculated the current for 81 (61) bias points using an average\nof 9 (8) iterations to converge the SCBA on an energy\ngrid of approximately 500 points. These SCBA calculations required 40 (18) hours on 10 Pentium-4 processors\nworking in parallel. For comparison, the corresponding\nLOE calculations can be performed in less than 1 minute\non a single Pentium-4 processor.\nThe results shown in Fig. 17 reveal that the LOE approximation captures the inelastic scattering signal with\na very satisfactory accuracy. The main discrepancy between LOE and SCBA is directly related to the elastic\npart of the transport which can easily be corrected for\nwithout solving the full SCBA equations, cf. Sec. IV D.\nWe have thus used our implementation of SCBA to justify that the simpler LOE scheme can actually be applied\nfor the IETS spectra of the hydrocarbon molecules. This\nis not a trivial result because the energy variation in the\ntransmission around the Fermi energy for these systems\nseems to violate one of the fundamental assumptions of\nthe LOE.\n\n1\n\nVI.\n0\n0.1\n\n0.2\nBias voltage [V]\n\n0.3\n\nFIG. 17: (Color online) Calculated IETS spectra for (a) an\nOPV molecule and (b) an OPE molecule.

Our implementation that extends\nthe Siesta implementation of Kohn-Sham DFT and the\nTransiesta scheme for elastic transport is described in\ndetail, highlighting the important computational steps\nfor the complete analysis. The inelastic transport problem is addressed using the NEGF formalism with the\ne-ph interaction treated up to the level of SCBA. We\nalso describe the computationally simple LOE scheme.\nAs illustrations of the methodology we have applied it to\nmodel the phonon signals in the conductance of atomic\n\n\f20\ngold wires and hydrocarbon molecules between gold surfaces. In both cases the comparison with experimental\nresults is very satisfactory. While we expect our method\nto be successful for a wide range of nanoscale systems,\nthere are also some important aspects where further research and development may lead to improvements. We\ntherefore close this paper with an outlook of some of the\nchallenges we believe are important.\nWhile we have argued that the vibrations for the systems considered here are reasonably well described by\nfree phonon Green's functions, there might also be situations where the phonon system has to be treated beyond free dynamics, e.g., by including self-energies from\ne-h pair damping, anharmonic phonon-phonon couplings\n(inside the device), and resonant phonon-phonon couplings (between device and electrodes). And as we have\nshown in this work, these precise damping conditions of\nthe phonons are governing the device heating. Another\nissue is the bias-induced changes in geometry and e-ph\ncouplings. Further development along these lines might\nthus lead to a better understanding of transport in the\nhigh-bias regime. On the more technical side, it would\nbe interesting to extend the present scheme to describe\nthe interplay between e-ph couplings and other delicate\neffects such as spin-polarized currents, spin-orbit couplings, etc. For instance, phonon heating could mediate\nan important effective interaction between the two spin\nchannels.\nIn conclusion, the present paper contributes to the\nevolving understanding of phonon scattering and local\nheating in nanoscale systems. These effects are important to elucidate the structural properties from the electronic transport characteristics and ultimately for the\nstability of devices.\n\nAPPENDIX A: HILBERT TRANSFORM\n\nThe purpose of this appendix is to discuss efficient numerical ways to approximate the Hilbert transform of a\ncontinuous function f (x), here defined as131\nZ \u221e\n1\nf (x)\nHx {f }(y) = P\ndx\n,\n(A1)\n\u03c0\nx\n\u2212y\n\u2212\u221e\nwhere P denotes the Cauchy principal value integral.\nWe approximate the function f (x) by a linear interpolation fI (x) to the values fi = f (xi ) known at the discrete grid points {xi }. This we can write in the following\nway\nf (x) \u2248 fI (x) \u2261\n\nN\nX\n\nfi \u03c8i (x),\n\n(A2)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere the kernel function associated with the linear interpolation is\n\u03c8i (x) =\n\nx \u2212 xi\u22121\n[\u03b8(xi \u2212 x) \u2212 \u03b8(xi\u22121 \u2212 x)]\nxi \u2212 xi\u22121\nxi+1 \u2212 x\n+\n[\u03b8(xi+1 \u2212 x) \u2212 \u03b8(xi \u2212 x)].\nxi+1 \u2212 xi\n\n(A3)\n\nOn this form we implicitly assume that the function falls\noff to zero at the ends of the grid, i.e., that the function\nhas finite support.

In this case we can write xi \u2212 xj = (i \u2212 j)\u2206,\nand the kernel function, that becomes a function of the\nindex difference m = j \u2212 i only, reduces to\n\u2206\nKm\n=\n\n1\u0002\n\u2212 (m \u2212 1) ln(m \u2212 1)\n\u03c0\n\u0003\n+2m ln m \u2212 (m + 1) ln(m + 1) .\n\n(A6)\n\n\f21\nPN\n\u2206\nThe Hilbert transform Hx {fI }(xj ) = i=1 Kj\u2212i\nfi has\nthen taken the form of a discrete convolution which effectively can be calculated with the Fast Fourier transform\n(FFT) algorithm. This scales only as O(N ln N ).\nAPPENDIX B: NUMERICAL\nIMPLEMENTATION OF SCBA\n\nCalculating the current numerically using the SCBA\nis highly nontrivial for large systems. This appendix discusses our solutions to the main difficulties encountered\nwithin the SCBA. We exemplify the size and scope of\nthe calculations, e.g., the sizes of matrices and the energy grid, with values taken from the SCBA calculation\npresented in Sec. V on the OPE molecule.\nThe current and power expressions Eq. (31) and (32)\nare integrated numerically using a third order polynomial\ninterpolation. Since the inelastic signal is typically small,\nthe current has to be determined with a high accuracy,\nwhich implies a fine resolution of the energy grid for the\nintegration. Further, the range of this grid has to include\nnot only the bias window but also additional energies due\nto the nonlocal character (in energy) of the Hilbert transform, cf. Eq. (39). These limitations make a nonuniform\ngrid preferable. We thus construct a dense grid around\neach of the important energies \u03b5 = \u03bcL,R , \u03bcL,R \u00b1 ~\u03c9\u03bb , . . .\nand a coarser one elsewhere. The resolution of the fine\ngrid is determined by the temperature and should have\na point separation around \u03b4\u03b5 \u2264 0.5 kB T . For the OPE\nmolecule we found it adequate at T = 40 K to use a fine\ngrid with \u03b4\u03b5 = 1.7 meV and a coarse grid with \u2206\u03b5 = 10.0\nmeV spanning the energy range [\u22120.5, 0.5] eV. With a\nnonuniform grid the necessary number of energy points\nmay thus be reduced.\nThe solution of the SCBA approximation requires substantial amounts of CPU time and memory. Analyzing\nthe memory requirements we find that we need to retain\n\u2276,r\nG\u2276,r (\u03b5) and \u03a3ph (\u03b5) in memory. Each of these matrices\n2\nrequires a memory allocation of O(Ngrid Nbasis\n) bytes,\nwhere Ngrid is the number of grid points, and Nbasis\nthe size of the electronic basis. For the OPE calculation in Sec. V each matrix takes up 500 Megabytes of\nmemory (500 energy points \u00d7 2502 matrix size \u00d7 16\nbytes/complex number). In addition to the demanding memory requirement, significant computational time\n(400 CPU hours in total) is needed.\nThe computationally heaviest part is the calculation of\nEq. (38), which we rewrite as\nh\nX\n\u2276\n(B1)\n\u03a3ph (\u03b5) =\nM\u03bb hn\u03bb iG\u2276 (\u03b5 \u00b1 ~\u03c9\u03bb )\n\u03bb\n\ni\n+(hn\u03bb i + 1)G\u2276 (\u03b5 \u2213 ~\u03c9\u03bb ) M\u03bb .\n\nFrom this equation we see that the CPU time scales\n3\nas O(Nph Ngrid Nbasis\nNiter ) [since each matrix multipli3\ncation scales as O( Nbasis\n)], where Nph is the number\n\nof vibrational modes and Niter the number of iterations\nneeded for self-consistency of the SCBA.\nWe have overcome the memory and computational requirements by a parallelization of our computer code by\ndividing the energy grid over the available processors.\nThe only significant complication is the evaluation of\nEq. (B1), where quantities couple across the energy division. To overcome this, we first redistribute the Green's\nfunctions G\u2276 (\u03b5) over the processors by changing from energy division to matrix indices division. Then the energyshifted Green's functions can be added for each matrix\nindex. Next we transform the outcome back to energy\ndivision and carry out the matrix multiplications with\nM\u03bb . We have implemented this procedure efficiently in\na way that lets the necessary communication occur while\nother calculations are running, i.e., while the lesser part\nof the equation is being communicated between processors, the matrix multiplications for the greater part are\nbeing computed and vice versa. In practice, this parallelization works very well and the computation time\nscales almost linearly with the number of processors.\n\nAPPENDIX C: SIGNAL BROADENING BY\nLOCK-IN MODULATION VOLTAGE\n\nAs discussed in Sec. III F the lock-in technique for\nmeasuring the differential conductance (and derivatives)\nintroduces a broadening of the intrinsic current-voltage\ncharacteristics due to a finite modulation voltage. The\nbasic idea is to measure the frequency components of the\ncurrent at multiples of the applied harmonic modulation,\nsince these relates to the derivatives of the current. Following Hansma,98 we can analytically write the frequency\ncomponents as the following averages over an oscillation\nperiod\n\nI\u03c9\n\n\u03c9\n\u2261\n\u03c0A\n2\n=\n\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0/\u03c9\nZ\n\nI[V + A cos(\u03c9t)] cos(\u03c9t) dt\n\n0\n\nZ1\n\ndI (V + Ax) p\n1 \u2212 x2 dx,\ndV\n\n\u22121\n\n(C1)\n\nand\nI2\u03c9\n\n4\u03c9\n\u2261\n\u03c0A2\n=\n\n8\n3\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0/\u03c9\nZ\n\nZ1\n\n\u22121\n\nI[V + A cos(\u03c9t)] cos(2\u03c9t) dt\n\n0\n\n\u00013/2\nd2 I (V + Ax)\n1 \u2212 x2\ndx,\n2\ndV\n\n(C2)\n\n\u221a\nwhere the modulation amplitude is A = 2Vrms .
