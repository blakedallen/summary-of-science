Possible implications are also discussed\nin this paper.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nHigher-order corrections to the Einstein gravity [1, 2] can be derived from the quantum gravity and the string\ntheory [3]. Application to the study of the inflationary universe [4, 5] have been a focus of research interest. In\nparticular, higher derivative terms also arise as an effective theory for the quantum corrections of matter fields in\na curved space[3].\nIn addition, Kaluza-Klein theory [6, 7] is also important in the study of the evolution of the early universe.\nIndeed, the dimensional-reduction process could affect the evolution of inflation universe significantly. Recently,\nbrane universe scenario has also become a focus of interest [8].\nInduced gravity models have been a focus of study for many reasons. Weyl is the first to propose that the scale\ninvariant theory is a candidate for the unified theory of gauge field and gravitational field. In addition, Dirac's large\nnumber theory also asserts that all dimensionful parameters in physical theory are in fact dynamical functions of\ntime. As a result, various interesting models have attracted researchers' interest for a long time.\nTherefore, we intent to study an N = 4 + D dimensional Kaluza-Klein higher derivative induced gravity model\nwith all dimensionful coupling constants replaced by appropriate scale-dependent fields. We will show that a\nconstant internal-space solution will lead to a nontrivial constraint to the field equations. In addition, there is also\nanother constraint derived from the assumption of constant internal scale-dependent scalar field \u03c8.\nIn fact, we will show in this paper that there are three constraints to be imposed on the choice of three\ndifferent coupling constants coupled to the higher curvature terms. Note that, in four-dimensional space, E =\nR\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 R\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u2212 4 R\u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd + R2 is the integrand of the Gauss-Bonnet term [9]. In addition, Weyl tensor [9] connects\nthese fourth-order curvature terms in four-dimensional space. Hence we only need to deal with R2 term in fourdimensional de Sitter space. These constraints does not hold in higher dimensional spaces. Therefore, we must deal\nwith all three different fourth-order terms in N -dimension. Hence equations of motion for the higher-derivative\nKaluza-Klein induced gravity theory[10, 11, 12, 13] are much more complicated than the four-dimensional higherderivative gravity. We will show, however, that the mentioned abundant constraints are not only consistent with\nthe already abundant stability constraints of the system but also lead to an interesting result: i.e. only the R2\ncoupling term is consistent with the inflationary solution. Possible implications will also be discussed in this paper.\nIn order to reduce the complication of the derivation of field equations, we will also derive a simple expression\nfor the Friedmann equation [14] in a (4 + D)-dimensional space in this paper. The redundancy of the associated\nfield equations due to the Bianchi Identity will also be analyzed. We will show that quadratic terms do not affect\nthe Friedmann equation in a constant flat internal space scale factor d(t) and flat de Sitter four space.\nThis paper will be organized as follows: (i) In section II, we will introduce the Kaluza-Klein higher derivative\ninduced gravity model with all dimensionful parameters replaced by appropriate dynamical fields. The constraint\n\u2217 wfgore@cc.nctu.edu.tw\n\n1\n\n\fderived from the constant \u03c8 field will be obtained in this section. (ii) We will derive a model-independent expression\nfor the N -dimensional generalized Friedmann equation in the higher-dimensional higher-derivative theory in section\nIII. These formulae are derived from a reduced one-dimensional theory. (iii) We will discuss the stability conditions\nfor an inflationary solution in the induced-gravity theory in section IV. (iv) Finally, conclusions are presented in\nsection V.\n\n2\n\nKaluza-Klein Higher Derivative Induced Gravity\n\nThe 4 + D-dimensional Kaluza-Klein higher derivative induced gravity theory can be described by the following\nLagrangian:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nLN = L \u2212 \u2202A \u03c8\u2202 A \u03c8 \u03c8 D .\n(1)\n2\nwith the 4-dimensional relevant higher derivative induced gravity Lagrangian L given by:\n1\n\u01eb\nL = L1 + L2 + L\u03c6 = \u2212 \u03c62 R \u2212 c1 (RAB CE )2 \u2212 c2 (RA B )2 \u2212 c3 R2 \u2212 \u2202A \u03c6\u2202 A \u03c6 \u2212 V (\u03c6)\n2\n2\n\n(2)\n\nHere L1 \u2261 \u2212\u01eb\u03c62 R/2, L2 \u2261 \u2212c1 (RAB CE )2 \u2212 c2 (RA B )2 \u2212 c3 R2 , and L\u03c6 \u2261 \u2212(\u2202\u03c6)2 /2 \u2212 V (\u03c6) denote the induced\nEinstein-Hilbert Lagrangian, higher derivative terms, and the scalar field Lagrangian.\nNote that, throughout this paper, the curvature tensor RE\nABC (gAB ) will be defined by the following equation\n[DA , DB ]VC = RE\n\nCBA VE .\n\n(3)\n\nE\nF\nE\nC\nAccordingly, RE\nABC = \u2212\u2202C \u0393AB \u2212\u0393AB \u0393CF \u2212(B \u2194 C). Here \u0393AB denotes the Christoffel symbol (or spin connection\n1 CE\nC\nof the covariant derivative, i.e. DA VB \u2261 \u2202A VB \u2212 \u0393AB VC ). To be more specific, \u0393C\n(\u2202A gEB + \u2202B gEA \u2212\nAB = 2 g\n\u2202E gAB ). Moreover, the Ricci tensor RAB is defined as\n\nRAB = RC\n\nABC .\n\n(4)\n\nAnd the scalar curvature R is defined as the trace of the Ricci tensor R \u2261 gAB RAB . Also, the Einstein tensor is\ndefined as GAB \u2261 21 gAB R \u2212 RAB .\nNote that we will use bold-faced notation (e.g. R) to denote field variables in N (= 4 + D)-dimensional space. In\naddition, normal notations will denote field variables evaluated in the 4 or D-dimensional spaces as the dimensional\nreduction process M N \u2192 M 4 \u00d7 M D takes places. Here M 4 is the four dimensional Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\n(FRW) space and M D is the internal space. We will assume that M D is the D dimensional FRW space for simplicity.\nNote that the metric of the 4+D-dimensional FRW anisotropic space M N is given by\nds2\n\n\u2261\n=\n\ngAB dZ A dZ B \u2261 g\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + fmn dz m dz n\n\u0010 dr2\n\u0011\n\u0010 dz 2\n\u0011\n2 3\n2\n2 D\n\u2212dt2 + a2 (t)\n+\nr\nd\n\u03a9\n+\nd\n(t)\n+\nz\nd\n\u03a9\n.\n1 \u2212 k1 r2\n1 \u2212 k2 z 2\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\n2\nand k1 , k2 = 0, \u00b11\nHere dp \u03a9 is the solid angle dp \u03a9 = d\u03b81 2 + sin2 \u03b81 d\u03b82 2 + * * * + sin2 \u03b81 sin2 \u03b82 * * * sin2 \u03b8p\u22123 d\u03b8p\u22122\n2\nstand for a flat, closed or open universe respectively. Note that we will also write gij = a hij and gmn = d2 hmn for\nconvenience. Note that \u03b8i is the phase angle of the D-dimensional spherical coordinate. For example, we have\n\nz1 = z sin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 * * * sin \u03b8D\u22122 .\n\n(7)\n\nNote that we will write N -dimensional space-time coordinate as Z A \u2192 (x\u03bc , z m ) with A(= 0, 1, * * * , N \u2212 1), \u03bc(=\n0, 1, 2, 3), and m(= 1, 2, * * * , D) denoting the N , 4, and D-dimensional space-time indices respectively. Specifically,\ncapital Roman letters A, B, C, * * * will denote N dimensional indices. In addition, Greek letters will denote 4-indices\nwhile the second half of the Roman letters will denote D-dimensional space-time indices. Here we have assumed\nthat the internal space (z) is independent of the external space (x). The only t-dependence of the internal space is\nthrough the scale factor d(t).\nInduced gravity proposes that all dimensionful parameters are dynamical variables. Therefore all coupling\nconstants in this models, \u01eb and ci , are dimensionless. Indeed, the action\nZ\n\u221a\n(8)\nd4 xdD z gLN\n2\n\n\f\u2032\nis invariant under the global scale transformation: gAB\n= \u039b\u22122 gAB , \u03c6\u2032 = \u039b\u03c6 ,\u03c8 \u2032 = \u039b\u03c8 in the absence of the\n4\npotential V unless V (\u03c6) \u223c \u03c6 . Here \u039b = constant denotes the global scale transformation parameter. For a\npractical application, one needs to introduce a symmetry breaking potential so that a physical scale can be picked\nup dynamically. As a result a physical inflationary solution can be managed. In addition, it is easy to observe from\nthe scale transformation that \u03c8 is introduced to compensate the transformation properties of the internal D-space.\nIn deed, \u03c8 D dD z is made dimensionless by construction.\nThe variational equation of the \u03c8 field gives\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n(9)\nD\u03c8 D\u22121 L \u2212 \u2202A \u03c8\u2202 A \u03c8 + DA (\u03c8 D \u2202 A \u03c8) = 0.\n2\n\nAfter the dimensional reduction process takes place, the \u03c8 field is expected to be a function of internal space\ncoordinate z only. Consequently, this internal space scalar field will not affect the 4-dimensional physical universe\nthereafter. For simplicity, one will assume that a constant solution \u03c8 = \u03c80 = constant is adopted so that the\nconstant \u03c8 field can be absorbed into the internal coordinate z by a proper re-scaling. In effect, the \u03c8 = constant\nsolution introduces a physical scale of the internal space. Note that the \u03c8 = constant is not only a solution to Eq.\n(9), it is also a solution consistent with the static internal space solution. Indeed, the scalar field \u03c8 is responsible\nfor the internal space dimension such that dz D \u03c8 D remain dimensionless. As a comparison, the scalar field \u03c6 is\nintroduced to take care of the dynamical dimension of all 4-space coupling constants. As a result, the \u03c8 field will\ndecouple from the 4-space completely after the dimensional reduction process is completed. The remaining impact\nof this solution is an additional constraint L = 0 to be made compatible with the dimensionally-reduced 4-space of\ninterest.\nTherefore, we will focus on the 4 + D-dimensional model given by the effective Lagrangian density L described\nby Eq. (2). Consequently, we will study the model (2) in the presence of the constraint L = 0 to be imposed later.\nIn fact, we will show that the constraint L = 0 is consistent with the inflationary de Sitter solution binding by\nabundant and interesting constraints to be imposed on the coupling constants ci . We will also study the stability\nof this inflationary solution and discuss interesting implications of this Kaluza-Klein induced gravity model.\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation of the system can be obtained from the variational equation of the 4 + Ddimensional metric gAB . We will write it as\nJAB = GAB \u2212 TAB = 0.\n\n(10)\n\nThe derivation is very complicate and delicate. Fortunately, if we are only interested in the 4+D-dimensional FRW\nspace, the dynamical variables reduce to a set of one-dimensional variables a(t) and d(t) and \u03c6(t).\nEffectively, we can write the Lagrangian L( gAB (a(t), d(t)), \u03c6(t) ) \u2192 Lr ( a(t), d(t), \u03c6(t) ). Hopefully, the final\nexpression of the Euler-Lagrange equations can be reproduced from the variation of Lr with respect to the dynamical\nvariables a(t) and d(t) and \u03c6(t).\nIf this is indeed applicable, the field equations can be derived more easily without involving complicate tensor\nalgebra. In particular, this will be more easy to access when complicate interactions are introduced. We will show\nthat there is a little problem with this approach for the non-redundant Friedmann equation. Fortunately, the\nnon-redundant Friedmann equation can be reconstructed by restoring the gtt variable. In a moment, we will derive\na set of modified formulae for this reduced Lagrangian Lr . For simplicity, we will drop the subscript r in Lr for\nsimplicity and economics of notations.\nNote also that the Bianchi identity DM GMN = 0 and the energy-momentum conservation law DM T MN = 0\nimplies that DM J MN = 0. In addition, the tt component of this Bianchi identity can be brought to the following\nform:\n(\u2202t + 3H + DI)Jtt + 3a2 HJ3 + Dd2 IJD = 0,\n(11)\nwith Jij = J3 hij . Since we only need two field equations for the one-D system of a(t) and d(t). Therefore, one of\nthe three field equations Jtt = 0, J3 = 0 and JD = 0 is presumably redundant. They are, however, not equally\n \u0307 6= 0 for simplicity. Indeed, the Bianchi identity implies that the\nredundant. Let us first assume that H 6= 0 I \u2261 d/d\nfirst equation Jtt = 0 is truly non-redundant: (i) Jtt = 0 implies that 3a2 HJ3 + Dd2 IJD = 0 for all times. Hence\nthe constraint J3 = 0 (or JD = 0) implies the vanishing of the other equation JD = 0 (or J3 = 0). (ii) J3 = JD = 0\nimplies that (d/dt + 3H + DI)Jtt = 0. Hence we have Jtt = constant exp[\u2212a3 dD ] which does not go to zero unless\na3 dD \u2192 \u221e. Cases (i) and (ii) mean that the Friedmann equation Jtt = 0 is truly non-redundant while J3 = 0 and\nJD = 0 are equally redundant. Therefore, we can ignore either one of the equations without losing any information.\n \u0307 = 0. As indicated by Eq. (11), we\nThis is, however, not true under the condition where d =constant, or I \u2261 d/d\nhave instead\n(d/dt + 3H)J \u0304tt = 3a2 H J \u03043\n(12)\n3\n\n\funder this condition. Here we have written J \u0304tt \u2261 Jtt |I=0 and similarly J \u03043 \u2261 J3 |I=0 . Therefore, the reduced Bianchi\nidentity (12) only tells us that J \u03043 = 0 is redundant as compared to the non-redundant Friedman equation J \u0304tt = 0\nunder the constraint I = 0. In fact, the d-equation or the a-equation has to be retained for a consistent check in\norder to make sure whether the system does accommodate a constant d solution. This point is often overlooked\nand should be checked carefully in the analysis of the Kaluza-Klein theory under a constant internal-space solution.\nBianchi identity implies that the N (N + 1)/2 Einstein equations GAB = TAB are not all independent, but\nrelated by N constraint equations DA GAB = 0. By looking at the conservation law of energy momentum tensor\nDA T AB = 0, one may interpret that conservation of energy momentum tensor implies the vanishing of DA GAB . The\nBianchi identity has, however, a more intrinsic geometric meaning. It is in fact a geometric conservation law. Note\nthat the Bianchi identity DA GAB = 0 has a simple geometric interpretation, namely, the boundary of a boundary\nis zero [15]. It implies that the energy momentum is automatically conserved for a system coupled consistently to\nthe geometry of space-time. In practice, the Bianchi identity is helpful in providing an easier approach to study the\nEinstein equation. For example, we can focus on, with the help of the Bianchi identity, independent components\nof the field equations. Indeed, as shown above that the Bianchi identity in the FRW space-time implies that : the\nFriedmann equation, the a-equation and the d-equation are related by the differential Eq. (11). This implies that\nthe Friedmann equation Gtt = Ttt has a less differential order than the other components of the Einstein equation.\nAs a result, Friedmann equation may serve as an useful tool in solving the differential equations.\n\n3\n\nGeneralized Friedmann Equation in one-dimensional formulation\n\nIn order to derive the non-redundant Friedmann equation from the reduced Lagrangian, we must restore the gtt\ndependence of the reduced Lagrangian L. Indeed, the Jtt comes from the variation of L with respect to gtt ,\n\u03b4L/\u03b4gtt \u223c \u01eb\u03c62 J tt /2. Hence the most convenient way to restore the gtt dependence of the reduced Lagrangian L is\nto introduce lapse function b(t) connecting the gtt metric component:\nds2\n\n\u2261\n=\n\ngAB dZ A dZ B \u2261 g\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + fmn dz m dz n\n\u0011\n\u0010 dz 2\n\u0011\n\u0010 dr2\n2 3\n2\n2 D\n+\nr\nd\n\u03a9\n+\nd\n(t)\n+\nz\nd\n\u03a9\n.\n\u2212b(t)2 dt2 + a2 (t)\n1 \u2212 k1 r2\n1 \u2212 k2 z 2\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nThis metric will be called as generalized FRW (GFRW) metric for the 4+D anisotropic space. Once the nonredundant Friedmann equation is derived from the variation of L with respect to b, one can set b = 1 and reconstruct\nthe b-independent Friedmann equation.\nThe non-vanishing spin connections can be listed as follows:\n\u0393\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd\n\u0393pmn\n\n= \u0393\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd ,\n= \u0393pmn ,\n\n(15)\n(16)\n\n\u0393\u03b3mn\n\n= \u2212\u2202 \u03b3 \u03b2gmn ,\n\n(17)\n\n\u0393p\u03bcm\n\n=\n\np\n\u2202\u03bc \u03b2\u03b4m\n.\n\n(18)\n\nHere \u2202\u03bc \u03b2 \u2261 \u2202\u03bc d/d comes with a non-vanishing t-component. In addition, we will write I = \u2202t \u03b2 for convenience\nfrom now on. Consequently, all non-vanishing Riemannian curvature components can be listed as follows:\nRtitj\n\n=\n\nRijkl\n\n=\n\nRtm tn\n\n=\n\nRim jn\n\n=\n\nRmnpq\n\n=\n\n1\n[H \u1e02 + 2B(\u1e22 + H 2 )]\u03b4ji ,\n2\nk1\n(H 2 B + 2 )(\u03b4ki \u03b4lj \u2212 \u03b4li \u03b4kj ),\na\n1\n[I \u1e02 + 2B(I \u0307 + I 2 )]\u03b4nm ,\n2\nHI\u03b4nm \u03b4ji ,\nk2\n(I 2 B + 2 )(\u03b4pm \u03b4qn \u2212 \u03b4qm \u03b4pn ).\nd\n\n(19)\n(20)\n(21)\n(22)\n(23)\n\nAs a result, deriving all Ricci tensors RAB and scalar curvature tensors R is straightforward.\n\u221a\nNote that there is also a t-dependent factor b(t) in the square-root of the metric determinant g \u223c ba3 dD .\nHence the variational equation of b can be shown to be [14]\nL\u2212H\n\n\u03b4L\nd\n\u03b4L\nd\n\u03b4L\n \u0307 \u03b4L = \u03c6\u03072 .\n\u2212I\n+ [H + H(3H + DI) \u2212 \u1e22]\n+ [I + I(3H + DI) \u2212 I]\n\u03b4H\n\u03b4I\ndt\ndt\n\u03b4 \u1e22\n\u03b4 I \u0307\n4\n\n(24)\n\n\fNote that the last term \u03c6\u03072 comes from the kinetic term of the scalar Lagrangian. Indeed, there is a kinetic coupling\nterm for \u03c6 via \u2212g tt (\u03c6\u0307)2 /2 = b\u22122 (\u03c6\u0307)2 /2. This will bring us an additional \u03c6\u03072 to the left hand side of Eq. (24). In\nfact, Eq. (24) can generalized to all fields coupled to the Einstein-Hilbert action.\nIn addition, variational equations of a and d also give\n\u03b4L\n\u03b4L\nd \u03b4L\nd\n\u03b4L\n\u03b4L\n= 0,\n(25)\n+ (H 2 \u2212 \u1e22)\n] \u2212 2k1\n\u2212 (2H + DI + )[\u2212(4H + DI + )\n+\n\u03b4H\ndt\ndt \u03b4 \u1e22\n\u03b4H\n\u03b4k1\n\u03b4 \u1e22\n\u03b4L\n \u0307 \u03b4L \u2212 (3H + (D \u2212 1)I + d )[\u2212(3H + (D + 1)I + d ) \u03b4L + \u03b4L ] \u2212 2k2 \u03b4L = 0.

This is a physical solution since the internal\nspace seems to be small from any physical observation up to date. As shown above, the Bianchi identity indicates\nthat the second a-equation (25) is derived implicitly by the first Friedmann equation (24) for the constant internal\nspace model. Therefore, we will try to solve Eq.s (24) and (26) for a complete analysis. As a result, the Friedmann\nequation (24) and the d(t) equation (26) become\n\u03b4 L\u0304\nd\n\u03b4 L\u0304\n= \u03c6\u03072 ,\n+ [H + 3H 2 \u2212 \u1e22]\n\u03b4H\ndt\n\u03b4 \u1e22\n\u03b4 L\u0304\nd\nd \u03b4 L\u0304 \u03b4 L\u0304\n+\nDL\u0304 = (3H + )[\u2212(3H + )\n] + 2k2\ndt\ndt \u03b4 I \u0307\n\u03b4I\n\u03b4k2\n\nL\u0304 \u2212 H\n\n(27)\n(28)\n\nunder the d(t) = constant background solution. Here a bar notation of a variable L denotes a variable evaluated at\nI = 0,. Explicitly, L\u0304 \u2261 L|I=0 . In addition, we must also check whether the solution is consistent with the constraint\nL\u0304 = 0. Our results agree with the equations shown in Ref. [21]. Details will be provided in the Appendix.\n\n4\n\nStability of an Inflationary External Space\n\nWe need to find out whether the inflationary background de Sitter solution H = H0 and I = 0 is a possible solution\nto the Kaluza-Klein induced gravity model. As a result, a stability analysis is also needed to find our whether this\nbackground solution is stable or not. Furthermore, following the conventional approach, the constant internal space\nsolution is assumed and should be served as a reasonable ansatz. This is because that the internal space information\nappears to be minor as compared to the 4-space counterpart. Otherwise, we would be able to measure the impact\nof the internal space physics once the internal space scale factor d(t) grows to some appreciable size. In addition,\nwe will also focus on the k1 = 0 flat 4-space condition which appears to agree with latest observations [16].\nTherefore, we will study the existence and stability problem of the inflationary universe for the induced KaluzaKlein model described above. The effective Lagrangian L\u0304 for the model L under the I = 0 condition can be shown\nto be\n1\n(29)\nL\u0304 = 3\u01eb\u03c62 [\u1e22 + 2H 2 ] \u2212 12(c1 + c2 + 3c3 )[(\u1e22 + H 2 )2 + H 4 ] \u2212 12(c2 + 6c3 )[(\u1e22 + H 2 )H 2 ] + \u03c6\u03072 \u2212 V (\u03c6).\n2\nIn addition, the variations of the I-equation are\nio\nh\ni\nh\nn\u01eb\n\u03b4\n(30)\nL\u0304 = 6DH\n\u03c620 \u2212 c2 \u1e22 + 3H 2 \u2212 12c3 \u1e22 + 2H 2 ,\n\u03b4I\n2\nio\nh\ni\nh\nn\n\u03b4\n\u01eb 2\n(31)\n\u03c6 \u2212 c2 3\u1e22 + 3H 2 \u2212 12c3 \u1e22 + 2H 2 .\nL\u0304 = 2D\n \u0307\n2 0\n\u03b4I\nTo summarize, there are two metric equations and one \u03c8 equation for the system:\n\u03b4 L\u0304\n\u03b4H\nd \u03b4 L\u0304\n(3H + )\ndt \u03b4I\n\u03c6\u03072 + H\n\nd\n\u03b4 L\u0304\n+ 3H 2 \u2212 \u1e22]\n,\ndt\n\u03b4 \u1e22\nd \u03b4 L\u0304\n= (3H + )2 ,\ndt \u03b4 I \u0307\nL\u0304 = 0\n\n= [H\n\n(32)\n(33)\n(34)\n\nunder the flat space condition and the constant internal space solution I = 0. The equation L\u0304 = 0 denotes the\nconstraint from the constant \u03c8 equation. Here L\u0304 \u2261 L|I=0 . The Friedmann equation reads:\n1 2\n\u03c6\u0307 + V = 3\u01eb\u03c62 H 2 + 6\u01ebH\u03c6\u03c6\u0307 + 12(c1 + c2 + 3c3 )(\u1e22 2 \u2212 2H \u1e26 \u2212 6H 2 \u1e22).\n2\n5\n\n(35)\n\n\fAt the end of this section, we will show that the perturbation equation of the constraint L\u0304 = 0 is consistent with\nthe inflationary de Sitter solution we are interested in. More specifically, the linear perturbation equations \u03b4 L\u0304 can\nbe shown to vanish automatically without generating any further constraint on the system. Therefore, there is\nno need to worry about the perturbation effect of this constraint. Hence we can add or remove the effect of this\nconstraint anytime. This result also indicates that the constant \u03c8 solution, the origin of this constraint, is a very\nreasonable ansatz. Furthermore, the \u03c6-equation can be shown to be\n6\u01eb\u03c6(\u1e22 + 2H 2 ) = \u03c6\u0308 + 3H \u03c6\u0307 + V \u2032 .\n\n(36)\n\nLet \u03c6 = \u03c60 + \u03b4\u03c6 and H = H0 + \u03b4H with \u03c60 and H0 some constant initial states for the inflationary de Sitter\nbackground solution. Here \u03b4\u03c6 and \u03b4H denote small perturbations against the background solutions. We will try to\nextract the linear solutions to the perturbation effect. As a result, the leading-order Friedmann equation (35) gives\nV0 = 3\u01eb\u03c620 H02 .\n\n(37)\n\nSimilarly, the leading-order scalar equation (36) gives\n12\u01eb\u03c60 H02 = V0\u2032 .\n\n(38)\n\nHere V0\u2032 \u2261 V \u2032 (\u03c60 ). Therefore, we have the constraints combined together as:\n\u03c60 V0\u2032 = 4V0 = 12\u01eb\u03c620 H02 .\n\n(39)\n\nNote that \u03c6V \u2032 counts the effective scale-dimension of the effective potential V (\u03c6). For example, \u03c6V \u2032 = nV if\nV = \u03c6n with effective dimension n. Therefore, this condition implies that the inflationary phase exists only when\nthe effective dimension of the effective potential is 4 at the inflationary phase \u03c6 = \u03c60 and H = H0 . Since V = \u03bb\u03c64\nrepresents the scale invariant potential in 4-dimensional space, i.e. dim (\u03bb) = 0 in 4-space, this condition will be\ndenoted as the scaling condition [12]. As an example, the spontaneously symmetry breaking potential of the form:\nV (\u03c6) =\n\n\u03bb 2\n(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c620 )2 + 6\u01ebH02 (\u03c62 \u2212 \u03c620 ) + 3\u01ebH02 \u03c620\n4\n\n(40)\n\nwith arbitrary coupling constant \u03bb can be shown to be a good candidate satisfying the scaling condition (39).\nIn addition, the first order perturbation equation of H-equation (35) and \u03c6-equation (36) can be shown to be:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(41)\n\u01eb\u03c60 \u03b4 \u03c6\u0307 \u2212 H0 \u03b4\u03c6 = 4(c1 + c2 + 3c3 ) \u03b4 \u1e26 + 3H0 \u03b4 \u1e22 \u2212 \u01eb\u03c620 \u03b4H,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\n(42)\n\u03b4 \u03c6\u0308 + 3H0 \u03b4 \u03c6\u0307 + V \u2032\u2032 (\u03c60 ) \u2212 12\u01ebH02 \u03b4\u03c6 = 6\u01eb\u03c60 \u03b4 \u1e22 + 4H0 \u03b4H .\nWriting \u03b4H = exp[hH0 t]\u03b4H0 and \u03b4\u03c6 = exp[pH0 t]\u03b4\u03c60 , the above perturbation equations can be written as:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u01eb\u03c620\n2\n\u01eb\u03c60 (p \u2212 1) \u03b4\u03c6 = 4(c1 + c2 + 3c3 )H0 h + 3h \u2212\n\u03b4H,\n4(c1 + c2 + 3c3 )H02\n\u0012\n\u0013\nV \u2032\u2032 (\u03c60 ) \u2212 12\u01ebH02\nH0 p2 + 3p +\n\u03b4\u03c6 = 6\u01eb\u03c60 (h + 4) \u03b4H.\nH02\n\n(43)\n(44)\n\nIn addition to the trivial solution \u03b4H = 0 and \u03b4\u03c6 = 0, consistent solutions also exist when h = \u22124 and p = 1. If\nh = \u22124, we will have the following constraint from the right hand side of Eq. (43)\nH02 =\n\n\u01eb\u03c620\n.\n16(c1 + c2 + 3c3 )\n\n(45)\n\nIn addition, the existence of nontrivial solution p = 1 implies that\nV \u2032\u2032 (\u03c60 ) = 12\u01ebH02 \u2212 4H02\n\n(46)\n\nfrom the left hand side equation of Eq.

As a result,\n\u03b4H = exp[\u22124H0 t] \u03b4H0 .\n\n6\n\n(47)\n\n\fEquivalently, the linear perturbation gives\nH = H0 + \u03b4H0 exp[\u22124H0 t]\n\n(48)\n\nas the solution to the Hubble parameter with a small deviation from the de Sitter background.\nWe will show in addition that the I-equation (33) and the constraint equation L\u0304 = 0 are both consistent with\nabove constraints in the presence of static internal space and de Sitter external space. Indeed, writing Dt \u2261 \u2202t +3H,\n\u03b4 L\u0304/\u03b4I \u2261 L\u0304I and \u03b4 L\u0304/\u03b4 I \u0307 \u2261 L\u0304\u0130 , the I-equation\n(3H +\n\nd \u03b4 L\u0304\nd \u03b4 L\u0304\n)\n= (3H + )2 ,\ndt \u03b4I\ndt \u03b4 I \u0307\n\nunder the condition of flat and static internal space can be integrated to give\nY (H) \u2261 L\u0304I \u2212 Dt L\u0304\u0130 = 6D(c2 + 4c3 )[\u1e26 + 4H \u1e22] +\n\nK1\n=0\na3\n\n(49)\n\nwith a constant of integration K1 . During the inflationary phase, we can ignore the effect of K1 term. Therefore,\nthe I-equation does not have a leading order contribution. In addition, the first order perturbation of this equation\ngives \u03b4Y = 6D(c2 + 4c3 )[\u03b4 \u1e26 + 4H0 \u03b4 \u1e22] which vanishes identically in compatible with the perturbation \u03b4H given in\nEq.

In fact, we can also compute the complete I-equation and find that\n \u0307 + 4\u1e22 2 + 7H \u1e26 + 12H 2 \u1e22] = 0.\nDt Y = 6D(c2 + 4c3 )[\u1e26\n\n(50)\n\nThere is no leading contribution either.

(47).\nAs mentioned above, we still have to compute all possible constraints from the internal space scalar field \u03c8equation L\u0304 = 0. It is interesting to find that the leading order perturbation equation for L\u0304 = 0 gives\n6\u01eb\u03c620 H02 \u2212 V0 = 3\u01eb\u03c620 H04 = 12(2c1 + 3c2 + 12c3 )H04\n\n(52)\n\nincorporating the scaling constraint V0 = 3\u01eb\u03c620 H02 . Therefore, the leading order equation of L\u0304 = 0 gives another\nconstraint\n\u01eb\u03c620\nH02 =\n.\n(53)\n4(2c1 + 3c2 + 12c3 )\nIn addition, the first order perturbation of equation this \u03c8 constraint can be shown to be\ni\n\u0003h\n\u0002\n3\u01eb\u03c620 \u2212 12(2c1 + 3c2 + 12c3 )H02 \u03b4 \u1e22 + 4H0 \u03b4H + (12\u01eb\u03c60 H02 \u2212 V0\u2032 )\u03b4\u03c6 = 0.\n\n(54)\n\nTherefore, this equation is completely consistent with the whole system by observing that all coefficients in above\nequation vanishes identically. Indeed, 3\u01eb\u03c620 \u2212 12(2c1 + 3c2 + 12c3 )H02 = 0 following Eq. (53). In addition, \u03b4 \u1e22 +\n4H0 \u03b4H = 0 and 12\u01eb\u03c60 H02 \u2212 V0\u2032 are automatically satisfied.\nIn summary, the constraints (45) and (53) indicate that the coupling constants should obey the following\nconstrain in order to admit an inflationary phase in the presence of a static internal space:\n2c1 + c2 = 0.\n\n(55)\n\nAs a result, the Hubble constant and the field parameters are related by:\nH02 =\n\n\u01eb\u03c620\n.\n8(c2 + 6c3 )\n\n(56)\n\nNote that above results indicate that: (1) static internal flat space solution is completely compatible with the\nconditions of inflationary solution; (2) the perturbation equation of L\u0304 = 0 is a perfect identity consistent with all\nother constraints derived elsewhere. This indicates that the constant \u03c8 solution is a very reasonable choice for the\nstationary state of the system. In addition, (3) the static internal space assumptions is also a consistent choice for\nthe existence and stability of the inflationary phase.\n7\n\n\fIn addition, we can also consider the perturbation of \u03c8 by setting \u03c8 = \u03c80 +\u03b4\u03c8 and perturb the field equation (9).\nThe result is DA \u2202 A \u03b4\u03c8 = 0. Here we have also used the identity \u03b4L = 0 under the linear perturbation shown above.\nAssuming \u03b4\u03c8(Z) = \u03b4\u03c8(z) such that the internal space z is completely decoupled from the 4-D space time. As a\nresult the perturbation equation DA \u2202 A \u03b4\u03c8 = 0 is consistent if \u03b4\u03c8(z) is a harmonic function obeying \u2202 m \u2202m \u03b4\u03c8 = 0.\nHence \u03b4\u03c8(z) = constant for a consistent perturbation. Therefore, the constant \u03c8 is also a consistent choice of\nbackground solution.\nNote also that the effect of the \u03c8 =constant implies that L = 0. Together with the constraint 2c1 + c2 = 0 for\nthe existence of an inflationary phase, one has effectively a scalar equation of the form\n\u01eb\nc2\n1\n\u2202A \u03c6\u2202 A \u03c6 + V (\u03c6) + \u03c62 R = (RAB CE )2 \u2212 c2 (RA B )2 \u2212 c3 R2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(57)\n\nwith a purely geometric source. Although the equation L = 0 is not exactly a Klein-Gordon equation of the form\n(\u2202 2 + m2 + R/5)\u03c6 = \u03b1R2 studied in Ref. [19], both theories appear to have similar physical origin. It was shown\nthat an effective re-normalized Lagrangian of the form \u03b1\u03c6R2 is a result of dimensional consideration. Indeed,\nthe coupling constant \u03b1 can only be made dimensionless, rendering a system free from introducing any additional\narbitrary length scale, if the space-time dimension N = 6 [19].\nNote that the scalar fields \u03c8 and \u03c6, both with dimension one, considered in this paper are designed to replace\nall dimensionful coupling constants with appropriate scalar fields. As a result, all coupling constants are assumed\nto be dimensionless in this approach. The only exception is some parameters associated with the SSB potential\nV (\u03c6) designed to pick up a symmetry breaking scale. The constraint equation L = 0 indicates that the scalar field\n\u03c8 introduced here may have close relation with the re-normalizability of the energy-momentum tensor for \u03c6. In\naddition, similar model has been studied in Ref. [20] with Gauss-Bonnet (GB) Lagrangian coupled to a perfect\nfluid. The constraint 2c1 + c2 = 0 in this paper follow first from the stability of the Friedmann equation (35) with a\ncoefficient of the combination (c1 +c2 +3c3 ) coupled to the quadratic interactions \u1e22 2 \u22122H \u1e26 \u22126H 2 \u1e22. This coefficient\nvanishes for GB term with c1 : c2 : c3 = 1 : \u22124 : 1. This is the main difference between the model considered in Ref.\n[20] and current models. In addition, we have also shown in the Appendix that the Friedmann equation agrees with\nRef. [21] up to a difference in the definition of sign of the coupling constants ci . Our inflationary phase solution\nalso agrees with Ref. [21] up to a scale due to the effect of the scalar field in this induced gravity model. Indeed,\nthe Friedmann equation and the I-equation implies that H02 = \u039b/6 and (c2 + 4c3 )\u039b = 1 respectively after setting\nV = \u039b for a system without a dynamical scalar field \u03c6. As a result, H02 = 1/[6((c2 + 4c3 )].\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is shown that replacing the internal space dimensionful coupling constant with a dimension one scalar field \u03c8 =\nconstant works harmonically with the Kaluza-Klein inflationary universe under the constraint 2c1 + c2 = 0. In\naddition, from the effective Lagrangian shown in Eq. (29), it is easy to find that any quadratic Lagrangian must\npresent itself as combinations of the form: L\u03042 = l1 \u1e22 2 + l2 (\u1e22H 2 + H 4 ) \u2261 \u221212(c1 + c2 + 3c3 )[(\u1e22 + H 2 )2 + H 4 ] \u2212\n12(c2 + 6c3 )[(\u1e22 + H 2 )H 2 ] with dimensionless li corresponding linear combinations of ci defined accordingly. Here\nL\u03042 denotes the quadratic part of the effective Lagrangian L\u0304. As a result, it can be shown that any quadratic\nLagrangian of the combinations L\u03042 \u223c l1 \u1e22 2 + l2 (\u1e22H 2 + H 4 ) will not contribute to the Friedmann equation.\nIndeed, the quadratic terms contribute to the Friedmann equation (32) according to\nE2 = L\u03042 + H(\n\nd\n+ 3H)L\u0304\u1e22 \u2212 H L\u0304H \u2212 \u1e22 L\u0304\u1e22 \u2192 L\u03042 + 3H 2 L\u0304\u1e22 \u2212 H L\u0304H\ndt\n\n(58)\n\nin the de Sitter background with LH \u2261 \u03b4 L\u03042 /\u03b4H and L\u1e22 \u2261 \u03b4 L\u03042 /\u03b4 \u1e22 shown in above equation. It is clear that\nthe l1 term does not contribute to above equation E2 in the de Sitter space with \u1e220 = 0. Therefore, we have\neffectively the quadratic Lagrangian L\u03042 = l2 (\u1e22H 2 + H 4 ) needed to be considered for its effect on the leading order\nFriedmann equation. As a result, we can show that L\u03042 \u2192 l2 H04 , H 2 L\u0304\u1e22 \u2192 l2 H04 and H L\u0304H \u2192 4l2 H04 . Hence the\ntotal contribution of the quadratic Lagrangian to E2 cancels each other. Therefore, this proves that the quadratic\nLagrangian does not contribute to the de Sitter solution in four dimension.\nThe perturbation equation for \u03b4\u03c6 indicates a constraint (46) V \u2032\u2032 (\u03c60 ) = 12\u01ebH02 \u2212 4H02 which turns out to be\ninconsistent with the SSB scalar potential (40). Indeed, V0\u2032\u2032 = 2\u03bb\u03c620 + 12\u01ebH02 for this potential. Hence the constraint\n(46) implies that \u03bb\u03c620 = \u22122H02 . A negative \u03bb indicates that the SSB potential is an unstable potential without\na global minimum. In fact, we can show that the local minimum is at \u03c62m = 0 and the local maximum is at\n\u03c62M = (1 + 6\u01eb)\u03c620 . Hence the consistent initial state \u03c60 of the scalar field will be expected to locate at the left hand\nside of the maximum point \u03c6M . The scalar field will hence roll down to the local minimum which is located at\n8\n\n\f\u03c6 = 0. This will lead to an un-physical state with infinite Newtonian constant G. In addition, this local minimum is\nalso not a stable vacuum state. \u03c6 will eventually tunnel to its global minimum at \u03c6 \u2192 \u221e. Therefore, the constraint\n(46) is not a physical constraint for the SSB potential and this is also true for the Coleman-Weinberg effective\npotential [17]. Hence the only consistent perturbation of \u03c6 is \u03b4\u03c6 = 0. This indicates that the de Sitter background\nis highly stable and compatible with the stable mode \u03b4H \u2192 0. Therefore, the system will remain stable as long as\nthe scalar field does change very slowly. Note that the negative coupling constant appears to be a universal features\nof any coupled effective potential including the Eric-Weinberg dynamical symmetry breaking potential [18].\nIndeed, the \u03c6 equation under the slow rollover assumptions, |\u03c6\u0307/\u03c6| \u226a H0 and |\u03c6\u0308/\u03c6| \u226a H02 , states that\n\u03c6\u0308 + 3H0 \u03c6\u0307 \u223c 0\nduring the period where H \u223c H0 . This gives\n\u03c6 \u223c \u03c60 +\n\n\u03c6\u03070\n[1 \u2212 exp(\u22123H0 t)].\n3H0\n\n(59)\n\nTherefore, the slow rollover-approximation is indeed consistent with the dynamics of the scalar field equation that\nhas been a focus of research interests in the literature. Therefore, \u03c6 does change very slowly during this inflationary\nphase.\nIn summary, we have derived abundant constraints from the assumptions: (i) \u03c8(z) = constant, (ii) d(t) =\nconstant. These assumptions are adopted partly from the fact that they are both not appreciable in the four\ndimensional physical universe observed today. Hence it is reasonable to freeze their dynamics at certain stage of\nthe evolutionary process. The abundant consistency shown in this paper compatible with the abundant constraints\nfrom these assumptions implies that these assumptions are in fact rather reliable. Although we are unable to\nprovide a dynamical reason for these assumptions from the first principle, compatibility of these assumptions with\nthe inflationary four space deserves more attention for its possible physical implications.\nOur result indicates, however, that both assumptions, static \u03c8 and static d, appear to be a consistent set of\nchoice for the higher derivative Kaluza-Klein models. As a result, the Kaluza-Klein higher derivative induced\ngravity theory behaves similar to the conventional four dimensional induced higher derivative gravity in the lower2\nenergy limit namely, only R2 and Rab\ncouplings remain effective during the inflationary de Sitter phase. This is\n2\n2\nin consistent with the 4-D theories that Rabcd\nterms can be replaced by R2 and Rab\ncouplings following the GB\ntheorem. Therefore, related research deserves more attention.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is supported in part by the National Science Council of Taiwan.\n\nA\nA.1\n\nAppendix\nField Equation\n\nThe field equation of the Lagrangian L = \u2212\u01eb\u03c62 R/2 \u2212 c1 (RAB CE )2 \u2212 c2 (RA B )2 \u2212 c3 R2 \u2212 \u2202A \u03c6\u2202 A \u03c6/2 \u2212 V can be\nderived by the variation of gAB .

The derivation has nothing to do with\nA\nwhether \u03b4\u0393BC is a tensor or not. Rather, by imagining \u03b4\u0393A\nBC is a tensor and use all related properties of tensor, it\n9\n\n\fhelps reducing the effort in deriving these equations, especially when integration-by-part is required. In addition,\nwe have also used the Bianchi identity DC DD RACDB = D2 RAB \u2212 DC DA RBC in converting the differentiation of\nRiemann tensor into differentiation of Ricci tensor. Note also that our result agrees with Ref. [21] up to a difference\nin definition of sign in ci . In particular, we can show explicitly that the Friedmann equation for static internal space\nagrees with Eq. (15) in Ref. [21].\nIn addition, the static I-equation (28) can be written as\nDL\u0304 = Dt Y = 6D(c2 + 4c3 )Dt [\u1e26 + 4H \u1e22] = 6D(c2 + 4c3 )Dt \u2202t [\u1e22 + 2H 2 ] = \u2212D(c2 + 4c3 )D2 R.\n\n(62)\n\nHere Dt \u2261 \u2202t + 3H. As a result, the static internal space I-equation can be written as\nL\u0304 + (c2 + 4c3 )D2 R = 0\n\n(63)\n\nwhich is identical with the mn component of the Einstein equation (60). Note that Rmn = Ran = 0 in the static\ninternal space condition. Therefore, the only thing left over from the mn component Einstein equation is identical\nto Eq. (63). Note that this result agrees with the Eq. (17) in Ref. [21].\nAs shown earlier, JAB = GAB \u2212 TAB = 21 RgAB \u2212 RAB \u2212 TAB = 0 can be decomposed into three different\nequations: Jtt = 0, gij Jij = 0 and gmn Jmn = 0 in the 4 + D dimensional space-time described by the GFRW metric\n(6). These equations correspond to the Friedmann equation (24), a-variational equation (25), and the d-variational\nequation (26). Therefore, this proves that Eq.s (24-26) and (36) are the complete set of field equations in the GFRW\nspace-time. We choose to ignore one of the redundant equation (25) in this paper without loosing any physical\ninformation as implied by the Bianchi identity (11).\nIn summary, the reduced formulae shown in this paper can be helpful in extracting some useful information\nwithout going into the details of the field equations. For example, the existence of the inflationary solution H = H0\nhas to do with the leading order equations. It can be done by ignoring any term like f (H)\u1e22, with f (H) arbitrary\nfunction of H. On the other hand, the stability of the inflationary solution has to do with those leading order terms\nlinear in time differentiation of \u03b4H. We can freely ignore terms like \u1e22 2 . In particular, (d/dt)(f (H)\u03b4H) = f (H)\u03b4 \u1e22\ncan be used to skip unrelated terms, with f (H) arbitrary function of H, with the close formula shown in this paper.\n\nA.2\n\nCurvature Tensor\n\nFor completeness of the calculation, we will list all non-vanishing components of the Ricci tensors, scalar curvatures\nand terms present in the Lagrangian:\nRtitj\n\n=\n\n=\n\n[\u1e22 + H 2 ]\u03b4ji ,\nk1\n(H 2 + 2 )(\u03b4ki \u03b4lj \u2212 \u03b4li \u03b4kj ),\na\n(I \u0307 + I 2 )\u03b4nm ,\n\nRijkl\n\n=\n\nRtmtn\nRimjn\n\n=\n\nHI\u03b4nm \u03b4ji ,\n\nRmn\npq\n\n=\n\n(I 2 +\n\nk2 m n\n)(\u03b4 \u03b4 \u2212 \u03b4qm \u03b4pn ).\nd2 p q\n\n(64)\n\n(67)\n\n(65)\n(66)\n\n(68)\n\nIn addition, one has:\nRtt\n\n=\n\nRij\n\n=\n\nRmn\n\n=\n\nR =\n\n\u2212[3(\u1e22 + H 2 ) + D(I \u0307 + I 2 )],\nk1\n\u2212[\u1e22 + 3H 2 + 2 2 + DHI]\u03b4ji ,\na\nk2\n2\n\u2212[I \u0307 + DI + (D \u2212 1) 2 + 3HI]\u03b4nm ,\nd\nk2\nk1\n2\n\u2212[6(\u1e22 + 2H + 2 + DHI) + D(D \u2212 1)(I 2 + 2 ) + 2D(I \u0307 + I 2 )],\na\nd\n\n(69)\n(70)\n(71)\n(72)\n\nand\n2\n(RAB\nCD )\n\n=\n\n(RAB )2\n\n=\n\nk2\nk1\n(73)\n12(\u1e22 + H 2 )2 + 4D(I \u0307 + I 2 )2 + 12DH 2 I 2 + 12(H 2 + 2 )2 + 2D(D \u2212 1)(I 2 + 2 )2 ,\na\nd\nk2\nk1\n12(\u1e22 + H 2 )2 + D(D + 1)(I \u0307 + I 2 )2 + 12(H 2 + 2 )2 + D(D \u2212 1)2 (I 2 + 2 )2 + 3D(D + 3)H 2 I 2\na\nd\n10\n\n\f+\n+\n(R)2\n\n=\n+\n+\n+\n\nA.3\n\nk1\nk1\n) + 6D(\u1e22 + H 2 + HI)(I \u0307 + I 2 ) + 6DHI(\u1e22 + 3H 2 + 2 2 )\n2\na\na\nk\nk\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2D(D \u2212 1)(I \u0307 + I )(I + 2 ) + 6D(D \u2212 1)HI(I + 2 ),\nd\nd\nk2\nk1\n2 2\n2  \u0307\n2 2\n2 2 2\n2\n36(\u1e22 + H ) + 4D (I + I ) + 36D H I + 36(H + 2 )2 + D2 (D \u2212 1)2 (I 2 + 2 )2\na\nd\nk1\nk2\nk1\n72(\u1e22 + H 2 )(H 2 + 2 + DHI) + 12D(D \u2212 1)(\u1e22 + 2H 2 + 2 )(I 2 + 2 )\na\na\nd\nk\nk2\nk\n1\n1\n24D(\u1e22 + 2H 2 + 2 )(I \u0307 + I 2 ) + 72DHI(H 2 + 2 ) + 4D2 (D \u2212 1)(I \u0307 + I 2 )(I 2 + 2 )\na\na\nd\nk\n2\n24D2 (I \u0307 + I 2 )HI + 12D2 (D \u2212 1)HI(I 2 + 2 ).\nd\n12(\u1e22 + H 2 )(H 2 +\n\n(74)\n\n(75)\n\nCompactification\n\nAnother way to derive the decoupled field equation is to assume that the N -space decouples according to M N \u2192\nM 4 \u00d7 M D via the following metric decomposition:\nds2 = gab (x)dxa dxb + d2 (x)hmn (z)dz m dz n\n\n(76)\n\nwith internal space metric gmn (x, z) = d2 (x)hmn (z).\nNon-vanishing spin connections are:\nm\nm\nm\n\u0393abc = \u0393abc ; \u0393cmn = \u2212E c gmn ; \u0393m\ncn = Ec \u03b4n ; \u0393np = \u0393np ,\n\n(77)\n\nwith Ec \u2261 \u2202c d(x)/d(x) a vector like function.
