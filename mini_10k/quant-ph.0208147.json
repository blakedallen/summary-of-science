In many physical implementations the unitary transformation is\ngenerated using an external driving field. This driving field has to perform the quantum\ngate between, for example, two qubits, without altering the other levels which represent\nadditional qubits. This means that the specific unitary transformation has to address a set\nof levels in an environment where other energy levels are present. An approach to correct\nthis undesired coupling to other levels has been suggested for specific cases [2] but a general\nsolution is not known.\nThe presence of a large number of levels coupled to the external driving field is specially\nrelevant in the implementation of quantum computing in molecular systems [3, 4, 5]. Tesh\net al. [5] proposed the use of optimal control theory (OCT) as a possible remedy. OCT\n[6] is a well developed approach that allows to obtain the driving field which induces a\ndesired transition between preselected initial and final states. However, the dependence on\nthe particular transitions (characterized by the initial and final states) makes the traditional\nformulation of OCT inappropriate for that purpose. For example, if the unitary transformation relates the initial states \u03c6ik with the final states \u03c6f k (the index k denotes all the\nrelevant states involved in the transformation), the traditional OCT approach derives an\noptimal field \u01ebk for each pair {\u03c6ik , \u03c6f k }. But the fields \u01ebk obtained are in general different,\nand then the transition induced by \u01ebk for the initial state \u03c6ik\u2032 won't necessarily give the right\nfinal state \u03c6f k\u2032 . To implement a given unitary transformation a single field \u01eb that relates all\nthe relevant pairs {\u03c6ik , \u03c6f k } is needed.\nAn approach to overcome this problem was suggested in [7, 8]. The idea is to generalize\nOCT to deal directly with the evolution operator. Recently, a different approach using\nsimultaneous optimization of several state to state transitions has been suggested by Tesch\nand Vivie-Riedle [9]. The purpose of this work is to compare the two approaches and two\npoint the similarities and differences between them. This comparison has led to new insight\ninto the use of optimal control theory for quantum systems.\nUnitary transformation optimization can be formulated in the following way. We consider\na quantum system with a Hilbert space of dimension M, expanded by an orthonormal\nbasis of states {|ki} (k = 1, ..., M). In the following we will assume that the k states\n2\n\n\fcorrespond to the free Hamiltonian proper states. The selected unitary transformation\nis imposed on the subspace of the first N energy levels of the system (N \u2264 M). For\nexample, the N levels could correspond to the physical implementation of the qubit(s)\nembedded in a larger system. The additional levels (k = N + 1, ..., M) are not directly\ninvolved in the target unitary transformation and they are generally considered as \"spurious\nlevels\" coupled to the field. However, it is not always the case: an example is the proposal\nof implementing quantum computation using rovibronic molecular levels. In the simplest\ndescription two electronic surfaces are considered. Two rovibronic states of one of the\nelectronic surfaces are chosen as the implementation of a qubit (in this case N = 2) and the\nunitary transformation is implemented using field induced transitions between the electronic\nsurfaces. Out of the relevant subspace (k = 3, ..., M) there are levels residing on both\nelectronic surfaces, spurious in the sense that any leakage to them would destroy the desired\nfinal result, but at intermediate times they are used as intermediate storage which allow to\ncarry out the desired unitary transformation [8, 10].\nThe optimization objective is to implement a selected unitary transformation in the\nrelevant subspace at a final time T . The target unitary transformation is represented by\nan operator in the system Hilbert space and denoted by \u00d4. For N < M, the matrix\nrepresentation of \u00d4 in the basis {|ki} has two blocks of dimension N \u00d7 N and (M \u2212\nN) \u00d7 (M \u2212 N). The elements connecting these blocks are zero. This structure means that\npopulation at the target time is not transferred between the two subspaces. Only the N \u00d7 N\nblock is relevant for the optimization procedure, and the other block remains arbitrary.\nThe dynamics of the system is generated by the Hamiltonian \u0124,\n\u0124(t; \u01eb) = \u01240 \u2212 \u03bc\u0302 \u01eb(t) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u01240 is the free Hamiltonian, \u01eb(t) is the driving field and \u03bc\u0302 is a system operator\ndescribing the coupling (transition dipole operator in molecular systems). Eq. (1) can be\ngeneralized to more than one independent driving field, for example, controlling separately\nthe two components of the polarization of an electro-magnetic field [11]. The dynamics of\nthe system at time t is fully specified by the evolution operator \u00db(t, 0; \u01eb). An optimal field\n\u01ebopt induces the target unitary transformation \u00d4 on the system, at time T if\n\u00db(T, 0; \u01ebopt ) = e\u2212i\u03c6(T ) \u00d4 .\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\fEq. (2) implies a condition only on the N \u00d7 N block of the matrix representation of \u00db. The\nphase \u03c6(T ) is introduced to point out that in some cases the target unitary transformation\n\u00d4 can be implemented up to an arbitrary global phase. The phase \u03c6 can be decomposed\ninto two terms, \u03c61 (T )+\u03c62 (T ). The term \u03c61 originates from the arbitrary choice of the origin\nof the energy levels which formally means that a term proportional to the identity operator\ncan always we added to the Hamiltonian. The phase \u03c61 is given by,\nPM\nEk T\n\u03c61 (T ) = k=1\n,\nM~\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Ek is the energy of the level k. By \u03c62 we denoted other contributions to the global\nphase due to the structure of the unitary transformation and its arbitrariness for the levels\nk = N + 1, ..., M.\n\nII.\n\nEVOLUTION EQUATION APPROACH.\n\nThe optimization approach proposed in [7, 8] is based on Eq. (2) by defining a complex\nparameter \u03c4 as\n\u03c4 (\u00d4; T ; \u01eb) =\n\nN\nX\nk=1\n\n\u2020\n\nhk|\u00d4 \u00db(T, 0; \u01eb)|ki .\n\n(4)\n\nAs \u00d4 is a unitary transformation in the relevant subspace, \u03c4 is a complex number inside a\ncircle of radius N. Its modulus is equal to N only when the unitary transformation generated\nby the field \u00db is equal to the target unitary transformation in the relevant subspace, except\nfor a possible global phase. The modulus of \u03c4 is a measurement of the fidelity of the target\nunitary transformation implementation by the field [8]. For N = M, the sum in Eq. (4) is\nthe trace of the operator product.\nIn [7, 8] the optimization of the real part of \u03c4 , or the imaginary part, or a linear combination of both was suggested as a method to find the optimal field. For simplicity we\nwill consider the real case. The maximization of Re[\u03c4 ] can be formulated as a functional\noptimization. In this work we use the following form\n#\n\" N\nZ\nX\n\u2020\n \u0304\nhk| \u00d4 \u00db(T, 0; \u01eb0 + \u2206\u01eb) |ki \u2212 \u03bb\nJ(\u00db, B\u0302, \u2206\u01eb) = Re\n\u2212 Re\n\n\"\n\nk=1\nN Z T\nX\nk=1\n\n0\n\nT\n\n0\n\n\u0012\n\ni\n\u2202\n+ \u0124(t; \u01eb0 + \u2206\u01eb)\nhk| B\u0302\n\u2202t ~\n4\n\n\u0013\n\n|\u2206\u01eb|2 dt\n#\n\n\u00db |ki dt ,\n\n(5)\n\n\fwhere \u00db, B\u0302, \u01eb0 , and \u2206\u01eb depends on t. The first term in the right-hand-side is the original\nobjective. In our formulation, the other two terms are constrains depending on a reference\nfield \u01eb0 and a field correction \u2206\u01eb. The term including |\u2206\u01eb|2 minimizes the total energy of\nthe correction. The last term introduces the dynamics of the system under the field \u01eb0 + \u2206\u01eb.\nB\u0302 is an operator Lagrange multiplier and \u03bb a scalar Lagrange multiplier [8]. The common\nOCT form for the functional [6] is recuperated setting \u01eb0 = 0 and interpreting \u2206\u01eb as the\ndriving field. However, Eq. (5) offers some advantages in the interpretation of the equations\nderived from the functional. More elaborated constrains are possible [12, 13], but they are\nnot relevant for the following discussion.\nApplying the calculus of variations, \u03b4 J \u0304 = 0, with respect to B\u0302, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nfor the evolution operator of the system is obtained,\n\u2202 \u00db\ni\n= \u2212 \u0124(t; \u01eb0 + \u2206\u01eb) \u00db ,\n\u2202t\n~\n\n(6)\n\nwith the condition \u00db(0, 0; \u01eb0 + \u2206\u01eb) = 11. The variation of \u00db give the Schr\u00f6dinger evolution\nequation for the operator B\u0302,\n\u2020\n\ni\n\u2020\n\u2202 B\u0302\n= \u2212 \u0124(t; \u01eb0 + \u2206\u01eb) B\u0302 ,\n\u2202t\n~\n\u2020\n\n(7)\n\n\u2020\n\nwith the condition B\u0302 (T, T ; \u01eb0 + \u2206\u01eb) = \u00d4. B\u0302 can be interpreted as the backwards propagation in time of the target unitary transformation \u00d4. It is related to \u00db by\n\u2020\n\nB\u0302 (t, T ; \u01eb) = \u00db(t, T ; \u01eb) \u00d4 .\n\n(8)\n\nEq. (6) and (7) represent the propagation forward and backwards in time of the boundary\nconditions of the problems, that is, the identity, 11, at time t = 0 and the target unitary\ntransformation, \u00d4, at time t = T . The variation of \u2206\u01eb leads to an equation for the correction\nto the field,\nN\n\nX\n1\n\u2206\u01eb(t) = \u2212\nIm[\nhk| B\u0302(t, T ; \u01eb0 + \u2206\u01eb) \u03bc\u0302 \u00db(t, 0; \u01eb0 + \u2206\u01eb) |ki] .\n2\u03bb~\nk=1\n\n(9)\n\nEq. (9), more than Eq. (5), is the central result of the optimal control procedure and\nconstitutes the starting point of the iterative algorithms devoted to determine the optimal\nfield [8]. When an optimal field \u01ebopt is found \u2206\u01eb = 0, and from Eq. (8) and Eq.

(10) constitutes a condition for the optimal fields for the first approach. It is the\nbase for the following analysis. Let us denoted by \u01eb\u0303 a field that generated the target unitary\ntransformation up to a global phase, \u00db(T, 0; \u01eb\u0303) = e\u2212i\u03c6 \u00d4. Using\n\u00db(t, 0, \u01eb) = \u00db(t, T, \u01eb)\u00db(T, 0, \u01eb) ,\n\n(11)\n\nthe diagonal block structure of the matrix representation of \u00d4 in the basis {|ki}, and the\nrelation hk|\u03bc\u0302|ki = 0, it is found that the left-hand-side of Eq. (10) gives\nIm[\n\nN\nX\nk=1\n\n\u2020\n\n\u2020\n\ne\u2212i\u03c6 hk| \u00db(t, T ; \u01eb\u0303) \u00d4 \u00d4 \u00db (t, T ; \u01eb\u0303) \u03bc\u0302 |ki] = 0 .\n\n(12)\n\nThis result implies that any field inducing the target unitary transformation up to a global\nphase is a possible optimal solution of the optimization algorithm based on Eq. (9). The\nconvergence to such a solution will depend on the particular numerical implementation.\nIt must be remarked that Eq. (10) is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the\noptimal field. For example, let us consider a target unitary transformation diagonal in the\nbasis {|ki} denoted by \u00d4D . The unitary transformation generated by the free Hamiltonian\n\u00db(t1 , t2 ; \u01eb = 0) is also diagonal in that basis, and then,\nIm[\n\nN\nX\nk=1\n\n\u2020\n\n\u2020\n\nhk| \u00d4D \u00db (t, T ; \u01eb = 0) \u03bc\u0302 \u00db(t, 0; \u01eb = 0) |ki] = 0 .\n\n(13)\n\nHowever, in general \u00db(T, 0; \u01eb = 0) is not equal to the target \u00d4D . These spurious solutions to\nthe optimization can be avoided with a different choice of the initial guess for the algorithm.\nIn optimization procedures based on Eq. (9) the full operator propagation in Eq. (6) and\n(7) is not needed since only the action of \u00db and \u00d4 on the states |ki in the relevant subspace\n(k = 1, ..., N) appears. Then only the first N rows of the matrix operator representations\n\u2020\n\nare propagated. Denoting by U k ((B \u2020 )k ) the k row of the matrix representation of \u00db (B\u0302 ) in\nthe basis {|ki}, and being Ujk ((B \u2020 )kj ) the j element of the row (j = 1, ..., M), the evolution\nequations (6) and (7) take the form,\n\u2202U k (t)\ni\n= \u2212 H(t) U k (t) ,\n\u2202t\n~\n\u2202(B \u2020 )k (t)\ni\n= \u2212 H(t) (B \u2020)k (t) ,\n\u2202t\n~\n\n(14)\n\nwith the conditions Ujk (t = 0) = \u03b4jk and (B \u2020 )kj (t = T ) = Ojk respectively, being Ojk the\nmatrix elements of the target unitary transformation \u00d4 and H(t) the matrix representation\n6\n\n\fof \u0124. The 2N evolution equations (k = 1, ..., N) are equivalent to the propagation of\n2N states of the system. The advantage is that in this case only 2(N \u00d7 M) elements are\npropagated instead of the 2(M \u00d7 M) in Eq. (6) and Eq. (7).\nIII.\n\nSTATE TO STATE APPROACH.\n\nThe state to state approach [9] is based on the simultaneous optimization of N transitions\nbetween pairs of initial and final states. These pairs of states {\u03c6il , \u03c6f l }, (l = 1, ..., N) are\nrelated by the target unitary transformation, |\u03c6f l i = \u00d4 |\u03c6il i. The objective is formulated as\n\u03b7(\u00d4; T ; \u01eb) =\n\nN\nX\nl=1\n\n|h\u03c8il (T ; \u01eb)|\u03c6f l i|2 ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03c8il (T ; \u01eb) is the state at the target time that evolves with the driving field \u01eb(t) and\nthe initial condition \u03c8il (t = 0) = \u03c6il . \u03b7 is a positive real number and its maximum value\n\u03b7 = N is reached when all the initial states \u03c6il are driven by the field to the correct final\nstates \u03c6f l . The task of obtaining the optimal field is equivalent to the maximization of \u03b7.\nThe set of initial states \u03c6il must be chosen carefully. In order to account for all the possible\ntransitions the states \u03c6il have to represent the relevant subspace. However, the choice of an\northonormal basis could produce undesired results. Let us denoted by {\u03c6\u0303il } an orthonormal\nbasis of the relevant subspace and by D\u0302 an arbitrary unitary transformation diagonal in\nthat basis. The product \u00d4 D\u0302 is also a unitary transformation. If \u01ebO and \u01ebOD are fields that\ngenerate \u00d4 and \u00d4 D\u0302 at time T respectively, it is found that the same optimization objective\nis obtained,\n\u03b7\u22a5 (\u00d4; T ; \u01ebO ) = \u03b7\u22a5 (\u00d4; T ; \u01ebOD ) ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u22a5 denotes that \u03b7 was evaluated using an orthonormal basis. Then any algorithm\nbased on \u03b7 and using an orthonormal basis would find the optimal field corresponding to\nany of the possible targets \u00d4 D\u0302 (\u00d4 is a particular case when D\u0302 is the identity operator).\nThe reason is that \u03b7 is sensitive to the modulus of the projection of each pair {\u03c6il , \u03c6f l } but\nnot to the relative phases between them. The phase problem can be overcome with a careful\nchoice of the states \u03c6il . Keeping the first N \u2212 1 states of the basis and substituting the N\n\u221a\nP\nN , the maximum condition is achieved only when the field induces the\n\u03c6\u0303\n/\nstate by N\nil\nl=1\ntarget unitary transformation up to a possible global phase.\n7\n\n\fThe optimization is formulated as the maximization of the functional\nZ T\nN\nX\n2\n|h\u03c8il (T ; \u01eb0 + \u2206\u01eb)|\u03c6f l i| \u2212 \u03bb\n|\u2206\u01eb(t)|2 dt\nK\u0304(\u03c8ik , \u03c8f k , \u2206\u01eb) =\n0\n\nl=1\n\n\u2212 2 Re\n\n\" N\nX\nl=1\n\nh\u03c8il (T ; \u01eb0 + \u2206\u01eb)|\u03c6f l i\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nT\n\nh\u03c8f l |\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202\ni\n+ \u0124(t; \u01eb0 + \u2206\u01eb)\n\u2202t ~\n\n\u0013\n\n#\n\n|\u03c8il i dt ,\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03c8il , \u03c8f l , \u01eb0 and \u2206\u01eb depend on time. The form in Ref. [9] is recuperated setting \u01eb0 = 0\nand interpreting \u2206\u01eb as the driving field.\nThe variations with respect to \u03c8li and \u03c8lf (l = 1, ..., N) lead to the following 2N equations\ni\n\u2202\n|\u03c8il i = \u2212 \u0124(t; \u01eb0 + \u2206\u01eb) |\u03c8il i ,\n\u2202t\n~\n\n(18)\n\nwith the condition |\u03c8il (t = 0)i = |\u03c6il i, and\n\u2202\ni\n|\u03c8f l i = \u2212 H(t; \u01eb0 + \u2206\u01eb) |\u03c8f l i ,\n\u2202t\n~\n\n(19)\n\nwith the condition |\u03c8f k (t = T )i = |\u03c6f k i. The variation respect to \u2206\u01eb leads to the equation\nfor the correction to the field,\n#\n\" N\nX\n1\nh\u03c8f l (T ; \u01eb0 + \u2206\u01eb)|\u03c6f l ih\u03c8f l (t; \u01eb0 + \u2206\u01eb)| \u03bc\u0302 |\u03c8il (t; \u01eb0 + \u2206\u01eb)i .\nIm\n\u2206\u01ebss (t) = \u2212\n\u03bb~\nl=1\n\n(20)\n\nEq. (18) and (19) are formally equivalent to Eq. (14), propagating forward or backward\n\non time the boundary conditions of the problem. Then the main difference between the two\napproaches is found in the expression for the correction to the field, Eq. (9) and Eq. (20).\nThe connection between the two expressions is established by rewriting the states \u03c6 and \u03c8\nas\n|\u03c6il i \u2192 |li,\n|\u03c6f l i \u2192 \u00d4 |li,\n|\u03c8il (t; \u01eb)i \u2192 \u00db(t, 0; \u01eb) |li,\n\u2020\n\n|\u03c8f l (t; \u01eb)i \u2192 B\u0302 (t, T ; \u01eb) |li\n\n(21)\n\nand Eq. (20) as,\n\" N\n#\nX\n1\n\u2020\n\u2206\u01ebss (t) = \u2212\nIm\nhl|\u00db (T, 0; \u01eb0 + \u2206\u01eb) \u00d4|li hl|B\u0302(t, T ; \u01eb0 + \u2206\u01eb) \u03bc\u0302 \u00db(t, 0; \u01eb0 + \u2206\u01eb)|li .\n\u03bb~\nl=1\n\n(22)\n\n8\n\n\f\u2020\n\nThis expression is formally equivalent to Eq. (9) except for the factor hl|\u00db (T, 0, \u01eb0 +\u2206\u01eb) \u00d4|li.\n(The different factor 1/2 can be removed with a redefinition of \u03bb). Omitting this factor\nthe two approaches would be completely equivalent: in that case the careful choice of the\ninitial state set wouldn't be necessary and the two approaches would lead to the same set\nof equations. In general the equivalence is only formal due to the additional factor and\nthe different set of states {|ki} and {|li}. In the following we will chose |li = |ki for\n\u221a\nP\nl = 1, ..., N \u2212 1 and |l = Ni = N\nk=1 |ki/ N . The condition for the optimal field (\u2206\u01eb = 0)\nis obtained using Eq. (20) and (8),\n#\n\" N\nX\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\nhl|\u00db (T, 0; \u01ebopt ) \u00d4|li hl|\u00d4 \u00db (t, T ; \u01ebopt ) \u03bc\u0302 \u00db(t, 0; \u01ebopt )|li = 0 .\nIm\n\n(23)\n\nl=1\n\nEq. (23) is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the optimal field, as is also Eq. (10).\nDenoting as before by \u01eb\u0303 a driving field generating the target unitary transformation up to a\nglobal phase, the left-hand-side of (23) gives,\n\" N\n#\nX\n\u2020\n\u2020\nIm\nhl|\u00d4 \u00db (t, T ; \u01eb\u0303) \u03bc\u0302 \u00db(t, T ; \u01eb\u0303) \u00d4|li = 0 .\n\n(24)\n\nl=1\n\n(The property Im[h\u03a8|\u03bc\u0302|\u03a8i] = 0 for Hermitian operator \u03bc\u0302 was used). Contrary to Eq. (12),\n\u2020\n\nthe phase \u03c6 doesn't appears in Eq. (24) due to the factor hl|\u00db (T, 0, \u01eb\u0303) \u00d4|li correcting each\nterm in the sum. Using the same arguments leading to Eq. (13), it can be shown that the\nleft-hand-side of Eq. (23) is null for \u01eb = 0 when the target unitary transformation is diagonal.\nThe previous results imply that any field that generates the target unitary transformation\nup to a global phase fulfills the condition in Eq. (23) and in addition spurious solutions\ncould be found, as in the first approach.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this study we have employed a modified formulation of OCT which uses the correction\nto the driving field \u2206\u01eb as central element. \u2206\u01eb = 0 is a necessary but not sufficient condition\nfor obtaining the objective. The relations derived from this condition allow a better analysis\nof the control equations, in particular, the similarities and differences between the two\napproaches. Optimal solutions of the evolution equation approach will be also optimal\nsolutions of the state to state approach. In this sense both approaches are equivalents. The\n9\n\n\fdifference between them is a term in the state to state approach which modified the phases.\nThis term can cause a phase ambiguity in the target unitary transformation. A careful\nchoice of the initial set of states can solve this problem.\n\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe want to thank Lajos Diosi and Zohar Amitay for many useful discussions.
