Maximal inequalities in ergodic theory provide an\nimportant tool in classical analysis. In this paper we prove the noncommutative analogue of the\nclassical Dunford-Schwartz maximal ergodic theorem thereby connecting these different aspects of\nergodic theory.\nAt the early stage of noncommutative ergodic theory, only mean ergodic theorems have been\nobtained (cf. e.g. [Ja1, Ja2] for more information). The study of individual ergodic theorems\nreally took off with Lance's pioneer work [L]. Lance proved that the ergodic averages associated\nwith an automorphism of a \u03c3-finite von Neumann algebra which leaves invariant a normal faithful\nstate converge almost uniformly. Lance's ergodic theorem was extensively extended and improved\nby (among others) Conze, Dang-Ngoc [CoN], K\u00fcmmerer [K\u00fc] (see [Ja1, Ja2] for more references).\nOn the other hand, Yeadon [Ye] obtained a maximal ergodic theorem in the preduals of semifinite\nvon Neumann algebras. Yeadon's theorem provides a maximal ergodic inequality which might be\nunderstood as a weak type (1, 1) inequality. This inequality is the ergodic analogue of Cuculescu's\n[Cu] result obtained previously for noncommutative martingales. We should point out that in\ncontrast with the classical theory, the noncommutative nature of these weak type (1, 1) inequalities\nseems a priori unsuitable for classical interpolation arguments.\nSince then the problem of finding a noncommutative analogue of the Dunford-Schwartz maximal\nergodic inequalities was left open. The main reason is that all usual techniques in classical ergodic\ntheory involving maximal function seem no longer available in the noncommutative case. In fact,\nthis applies for the definition of the maximal function itself. As an example, we consider\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2 0\n1 1\n0 0\na1 =\n, a2 =\n, a3 =\n.\n0 0\n1 1\n0 1\nThen there is no 2 \u00d7 2 matrix a such that\n\n\b\nh\u03be, a\u03bei = max h\u03be, a1 \u03bei, h\u03be, a2 \u03bei h\u03be, a3 \u03bei\n\nholds for all \u03be \u2208 l22 .\nHowever, this obstacle has been overcome recently in the theory of noncommutative martingale\ninequalities. In fact, most of the classical martingale inequalities have been successfully transferred\nto the noncommutative setting. These include Burkholder inequalities on conditioned square function [JX2], Burkholder-Gundy inequalities on square function [PX1], Doob maximal inequality\n[Ju], Rosenthal inequalities on independent random variables [JX4] and boundedness of martingale\ntransforms [Ra]. See the survey [X] for the state of the art regarding this theory.\nLet us point out that this new development of noncommutative martingale inequalities is inspired and motivated by interactions with operator space theory. For instance, the formulation of\nthe noncommutative Doob maximal inequality was directly derived from Pisier's theory of vectorvalued noncommutative Lp -spaces [P].\nFollowing the well-known analogy between martingale theory and ergodic theory, we show that\nthe techniques developed for noncommutative martingales can be used to prove the noncommutative maximal ergodic inequalities as well.\nTo state our main results we need some notation. Let M be a semifinite von Neumann algebra\nequipped with a normal semifinite faithful trace \u03c4 . Let Lp (M) be the associated noncommutative\nLp -space. Let T : M \u2192 M be a linear map which might satisfy some of the following properties\n(0.I) T is a contraction on M: kT xk\u221e \u2264 kxk\u221e for all x \u2208 M.\n(0.II) T is positive: T x \u2265 0 if x \u2265 0.\n(0.III) \u03c4 \u25e6 T \u2264 \u03c4 : \u03c4 (T (x)) \u2264 \u03c4 (x) for all x \u2208 L1 (M) \u2229 M+ .\n1\n\n\f(0.IV) T is symmetric relative to \u03c4 : \u03c4 (T (y)\u2217 x) = \u03c4 (y \u2217 T (x)) for all x, y \u2208 L2 (M) \u2229 M.\nThe properties (0.I), (0.II) and (0.III) will be essential for what follows. If T satisfies these\nproperties, then T naturally extends to a contraction on Lp (M) for all 1 \u2264 p < \u221e (see Lemma 1.1\nbelow). The extension will be still denoted by T . If T additionally has (0.IV), then its extension\nis selfadjoint on L2 (M). We consider the ergodic averages of T :\nMn (T ) =\n\nn\n1 X k\nT ,\nn+1\nk=0\n\nn \u2208 N.\n\nThe following is one of our main results:\nTheorem 0.1 Let 1 < p < \u221e and T be a linear map satisfying (0.I) - (0.III) above.\ni) For any x \u2208 Lp (M) with x \u2265 0 there is a \u2208 Lp (M) such that\n\u2200 n \u2208 N, Mn (T )(x) \u2264 a\n\nand\n\nkakp \u2264 Cp kxkp ,\n\nwhere Cp is a positive constant depending only on p. Moreover, Cp \u2264 Cp2 (p \u2212 1)\u22122 and\n(p \u2212 1)\u22122 is the optimal order of Cp as p \u2192 1.\nii) If additionally T satisfies (0.IV), then for any x \u2208 Lp (M) with x \u2265 0 there is a \u2208 Lp (M) such\nthat\n\u2200 n \u2208 N, T n (x) \u2264 a and kakp \u2264 Cp\u2032 kxkp .\nPart i) above is the noncommutative analogue of the classical Dunford-Schwartz theorem in\ncommutative Lp -spaces (cf. [DS]). Note that the optimal order of the constant Cp above is different from that in the commutative case, which is (p \u2212 1)\u22121 as p \u2192 1. Part ii) is the noncommutative\nanalogue of Stein's maximal ergodic inequality (see [St2]). Note that in the case where \u03c4 is normalized (i.e. \u03c4 (1) = 1), the following weak form of part i) was obtained in [GoG]: Given \u03b5 > 0\nsuch that p \u2212 \u03b5 > 1 and x \u2208 Lp (M) (x \u2265 0) there is a \u2208 Lp\u2212\u03b5 (M) such that\n\u2200 n \u2208 N, Mn (T )(x) \u2264 a\n\nand kakp\u2212\u03b5 \u2264 Cp,\u03b5 kxkp .\n\nAs in the commutative case, Theorem 0.1 also holds for all elements of Lp (M) (not only the\npositive ones). This requires an appropriate definition of the space Lp (M; l\u221e ) in the noncommutative setting (see section 2 for more details). On the other hand, by discretization, we have a\nsimilar theorem for semigroups.\nThe proof of Theorem 0.1, i) relies on Yeadon's weak type (1,1) maximal ergodic inequality\nalready quoted before (see also Lemma 1.2 below). As in the commutative case, the main idea\nis to interpolate this weak type (1,1) inequality with the trivial case p = \u221e. Additional complications are due to the fact that the weak type (1,1) estimate does not provide a majorant\n\u2212a \u2264 Mn (T )(x) \u2264 a such that a is in weak L1 . In our proof of the noncommutative version of\nthe classical Marcinkiewicz theorem (see Theorem 3.1 below) we first establish an intermediate\ninequality using noncommutative Lorentz spaces. Then we use the real interpolation method. We\nshould emphasize that contrary to the classical situation, this interpolation theorem is not valid\nfor the spaces Lp (M; l\u221e ) themselves but only for their positive cones.\nFor the proof of part ii) of Theorem 0.1, we adapt Stein's arguments in [St2] to the noncommutative setting.\nAs usual, the maximal ergodic inequalities in Theorem 0.1 imply the corresponding pointwise\nergodic theorems. The arguments are standard in the tracial case. However, the non tracial case\nrequires additional work (see section 7). Our approach to the individual ergodic theorems seems\nnew. In order to ensure pointwise convergence we use the space Lp (M; c0 ) which is the closure\nof finite sequences in Lp (M; l\u221e ) (p < \u221e). The main step towards individual ergodic theorems is\ncontained in the following result:\n2\n\n\fTheorem 0.2 Let 1 < p < \u221e and T satisfy (0.I) - (0.III). Let F be the projection\nonto the fixed\n\u0001\npoint subspace of T considered as a map on Lp (M). Then Mn (x) \u2212 F (x) n \u2208 Lp (M; c0 ) for any\n\u0001\nx \u2208 Lp (M). If additionally, T has (0.IV), then T n (x) \u2212 F (x) n \u2208 Lp (M; c0 ).\n\nLet us mention here one application to free group von Neumann algebras for illustration. Let\nFn be a free group on n generators, and let V N (Fn ) be its von Neumann algebra equipped with\nthe canonical normalized trace \u03c4 . Let \u03bb be the left regular representation of Fn on l2 (Fn ). Recall\nthat V N (Fn ) is the von Neumann algebra on l2 (Fn ) generated by {\u03bb(g) : g \u2208 Fn }. Let | * | denote\nthe length function on Fn (relative to a fix family of n generators). Haagerup [H4] proved that the\nmap Tt defined by Tt (\u03bb(g)) = e\u2212t|g| \u03bb(g) extends to a completely positive map on V N (Fn ). It is\neasy to check that Tt possesses all properties (0.I) - (0.IV). Consequently, Tt extends to a positive\ncontraction on Lp (V N (Fn )) for all 1 \u2264 p < \u221e (still denoted by Tt ). It is then clear that (Tt ) is a\nsymmetric semigroup on Lp (V N (Fn )) and strongly continuous for p < \u221e. Thus applying Theorem\n0.1, ii) to this semigroup, we obtain the following result formulated in terms of (bilateral) almost\nuniform convergence:\nTheorem 0.3 Let 1 < p \u2264 \u221e. Then for any x \u2208 Lp (V N (Fn )) with x \u2265 0 there is a \u2208 Lp (V N (Fn ))\nsuch that\n\u2200 t > 0, Tt (x) \u2264 a and kakp \u2264 Cp\u2032 kxkp .\n\nConsequently, limt\u21920 Tt (x) = x bilaterally almost uniformly (and almost uniformly if p > 2) for\nany x \u2208 Lp (V N (Fn )).\n\nThe notion of (bilateral) almost uniform convergence is a noncommutative analogue of the\nnotion of almost everywhere convergence. We refer to section 6 for the relevant definitions. Note\nthat when n = 1, V N (F1 ) is just L\u221e (T), where T is the unit circle and Tt becomes the usual\nPoisson semigroup. Thus the theorem above is the free analogue of the classical radial maximal\ninequality and of the radial pointwise convergence theorem about the Poisson integral in the unit\ndisc.\nLet us end this introduction with a brief description of the organization of the paper. The first\nsix sections concern solely the semifinite case. After a preliminary section, we give some elementary\nproperties on the vector-valued noncommutative Lp -spaces Lp (M; l\u221e ) in section 2. These vectorvalued Lp -spaces were first introduced by Pisier [P] for injective von Neumann algebras and then\nextended to general von Neumann algebras by the first named author in [Ju]. They provide the\nmain tool of this paper.\nSection 3 is devoted to the noncommutative analogue of the classical Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem. This is the most technical result of the paper. It seems reasonable to expect further\napplications in the noncommutative setting.\nSection 4 contains our first maximal ergodic theorems. The main result there is Theorem 0.1,\ni). This is an immediate consequence of the previous interpolation theorem.\nSection 5 deals with the maximal inequalities when assuming the symmetry condition (0.IV).\nIn particular, we prove Theorem 0.1, ii). Our proof requires Stein's interpolation technique using\nfractional averages (which makes it quite involved).\nIn Section 6 we study the individual ergodic theorems. In particular, we prove Theorem 0.2\nabove.\nThe objective of section 7 is to extend all previous results to the general (non-tracial) von\nNeumann algebras by a reduction argument. This argument is based on an important (unfortunately) unpublished result due to Haagerup [H3]. Let us mention that the arguments for pointwise\nconvergence in Haagerup Lp -spaces are usually more delicate than their semifinite counterparts.\nHowever, our new approach presented in section 6 permits us to give a unified treatment of both\ncases.\nSection 8 presents some natural examples to which our theory applies. These include the free\nproducts of completely positive semigroups, the Poisson semigroup of a free group (which yields\nTheorem 0.3 above) and the q-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroups.\n3\n\n\fThe main results of this paper were announced in [JX1].\n\n1\n\nPreliminaries\n\nThe noncommutative Lp -spaces used in this paper are most of the time those based on semifinite\nvon Neumann algebras, except those in the last two sections. Thus in this preliminary section\nwe concentrate ourselves only on the semifinite noncommutative Lp -spaces. There are numerous\nreferences for these spaces. Our main reference is [FK]. The recent survey [PX2] presents a rather\ncomplete picture on noncommutative integration and contains a lot of references.\nLet M be a semifinite von Neumann algebra equipped with a normal semifinite faithful trace \u03c4 .\nLet S+ denote the set of all x \u2208 M+ such that \u03c4 (supp x) < \u221e, where supp x denotes the support\nof x. Let S be the linear span of S+ . Then S is a w*-dense \u2217-subalgebra of M. Given 0 < p < \u221e,\nwe define\n\u0002\n\u00031/p\nkxkp = \u03c4 (|x|p )\n, x \u2208 S,\n\nwhere |x| = (x\u2217 x)1/2 is the modulus of x. Then (S, k * kp ) is a normed (or quasi-normed for\np < 1) space, whose completion is the noncommutative Lp -space associated with (M, \u03c4 ), denoted\nby Lp (M, \u03c4 ) or simply by Lp (M). As usual, we set L\u221e (M, \u03c4 ) = M equipped with the operator\nnorm.\nThe elements in Lp (M) can be viewed as closed densely defined operators on H (H being the\nHilbert space on which M acts). We recall this briefly. Let L0 (M) = L0 (M, \u03c4 ) denote the space\nof all closed densely defined operators on H measurable with respect to (M, \u03c4 ). For a measurable\noperator x we define its generalized singular numbers by\n\b\n\u0001\n\u03bct (x) = inf \u03bb > 0 : \u03c4 1l(\u03bb,\u221e) (|x|) \u2264 t , t > 0.\nLet\n\nV (\u03b5, \u03b4) = {x \u2208 L0 (M) : \u03bc\u03b5 (x) \u2264 \u03b4}.\nThen {V (\u03b5, \u03b4) : \u03b5 > 0, \u03b4 > 0} is a system of neighbourhoods at 0 for which L0 (M) becomes\na metrizable topological \u2217-algebra. The convergence with respect to this topology is called the\nconvergence in measure. Moreover, M is dense in L0 (M).\nThe trace \u03c4 extends to a positive tracial functional on the positive part L+\n0 (M) of L0 (M), still\ndenoted by \u03c4 , satisfying\nZ\n\u221e\n\n\u03c4 (x) =\n\nx \u2208 L+\n0 (M).\n\n\u03bct (x)dt,\n\n0\n\nThen for 0 < p < \u221e,\nand for x \u2208 Lp (M)\n\n\b\nLp (M) = x \u2208 L0 (M) : \u03c4 (|x|p ) < \u221e\nkxkpp = \u03c4 (|x|p ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n(\u03bct (x))p dt .\n\n0\n\nMore generally, we can define the noncommutative Lorentz space Lp,q (M):\n\b\nLp,q (M, \u03c4 ) = x \u2208 L0 (M) : kxkp,q < \u221e ,\n\nwhere\n\nkxkp,q =\n\n\u0010Z\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n\u0001q dt \u00111/q\n1\nt p \u03bct (x)\nt\n\nfor q < \u221e and with the usual modification for q = \u221e. The positive cone of Lp,q (M) is denoted by\nL+\np,q (M)\n\n4\n\n\fAs the commutative Lp -spaces, the noncommutative Lp -spaces behave well with respect to\nthe complex interpolation method and the real interpolation method (in the semifinite case). Let\n0 < \u03b8 < 1, 1 \u2264 p0 < p1 \u2264 \u221e and 1 \u2264 q0 , q1 , q \u2264 \u221e. Then\n\u0001\n(1.1)\nLp (M) = Lp0 (M), Lp1 (M) \u03b8 (with equal norms)\n\nand\n\n(1.2)\n\n\u0001\nLp,q (M) = Lp0 ,q0 (M), Lp1 ,q1 (M) \u03b8,q\n\n(with equivalent norms),\n\n\u03b8\n1\u2212\u03b8\n1\n+ , and where (* , *)\u03b8 , (* , *)\u03b8,q denote respectively the complex and real inter=\np\np0\np1\npolation methods. Our reference for interpolation theory is [BeL].\nwhere\n\nLet T be a linear map on Lp (M). T is called positive if T preserves the positive cone of Lp (M),\ni.e. x \u2265 0 =\u21d2 T x \u2265 0. The following lemma is elementary and certainly well-known. See [Ye],\nwhere the extensions of T to all Lp (M) were obtained but not their contractivity. The contractive\nextensions are, of course, important in ergodic theory. We include a proof for completeness.\nLemma 1.1 Let T satisfy (0.I) - (0.III). Then T extends in a natural way to a positive contraction\non Lp (M) for all 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. Moreover, T is normal on M. If T additionally has (0.IV), the\nextension of T on L2 (M) is selfadjoint.\n+\nProof. It is clear that T extends to L+\n1 (M) and kT xk1 \u2264 kxk1 for all x \u2208 L1 (M). Then by a\nstandard argument, T extends to a bounded map on L1 (M), still denoted by T , which is of norm\n\u2264 2 and positive too. By duality, S = T \u2217 : M \u2192 M is a bounded positive map. Consequently,\nkSk = kS(1)k\u221e (see [Pau]). However, one easily checks that kS(1)k\u221e \u2264 1. Thus S is contractive,\nand so is T on L1 (M). Then by complex interpolation, T extends to a contraction on Lp (M) for\nall 1 < p < \u221e.\nNote that the positive map S on M introduced above satisfies the same assumptions as T . Thus\napplying the result just proved to S instead of T , we see that S can be extended to a contraction\non L1 (M). Then a simple calculation shows that the adjoint of this extension of S on L1 (M) is\nequal to T . Hence T is normal on M. The last part is clear.\n\u0003\n\nIn the sequel, unless explicitly specified otherwise, T will always denote a map on M with (0.I)\n- (0.III). The same symbol T will also stand for the extensions of T on Lp (M) given by Lemma\n1.1. Let T be such a map. We form its ergodic averages:\nn\n1 X k\nT .\nMn (T ) =\nn+1\nk=0\n\nMn (T ) will be denoted by Mn whenever no confusion can occur.\nBy general ergodic theory on Banach spaces (cf. [DS]), one sees that T is mean ergodic on\nLp (M) for any 1 < p < \u221e, i.e. Mn (x) converges to x\nb in Lp (M) for all x \u2208 M. On the other hand,\nin case the trace \u03c4 is finite, by a well-known mean ergodic theorem (cf. e.g. [Ja1, Theorem 2.2.1]\nand the references therein), Mn (x) converges to x\nb with respect to the strong operator topology\nfor every x \u2208 M. This implies (and in fact is equivalent to) that Mn (x) converges to x\nb for any\nx \u2208 L1 (M).\nT induces a canonical splitting on Lp (M) for 1 < p < \u221e:\nLp (M) = Fp (T ) \u2295 Fp (T )\u22a5 ,\nwhere Fp (T ) = {x \u2208 Lp (M) : T (x) = x} and Fp (T )\u22a5 is the closure of the image (I \u2212 T )(Lp (M)).\nThe dual space of Fp (T ) coincides with Fp\u2032 (T ), where p\u2032 is the index conjugate to p. If in addition\n5\n\n\f\u03c4 is finite, the previous splitting is also true for p = 1 and p = \u221e. Note then however that F\u221e (T )\u22a5\nis the w*-closure of the image (I \u2212 T )(L\u221e (M)).\nLet Fp be the contractive positive projection from Lp (M) onto Fp (T ). Then F2 is the orthogonal\nprojection from L2 (M) onto F2 (T ) and Fp\u2217 = Fp\u2032 for 1 < p < \u221e. (This is also true for p = 1\nif \u03c4 is finite.) Note that Fp and Fq coincide on Fp (T ) \u2229 Fq (T ) for two different p, q. This allows\nto denote the Fp 's by a same symbol F in the sequel. All previous facts are elementary and well\nknown (cf. e.g. [Ye]).\nLet us transfer the discussion above to the setting of semigroups. We will say that a semigroup\n(Tt )t\u22650 of linear maps on M satisfies one of the conditions (0.I)-(0.IV) if so does Tt for every\nt \u2265 0. All semigroups considered in this paper will be assumed to satisfy (0.I) - (0.III). They\nwill be further required to be w*-continuous on M and such that T0 is the identity. As before,\nsuch semigroups are automatically extended to positive contractive semigroups on Lp (M) for every\n1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e. Note that the w*-continuity of (Tt ) on M implies that (Tt ) is strongly (i.e. norm)\ncontinuous on Lp (M) for 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. Put again\nZ\n1 t s\nT ds, t > 0.\nMt =\nt 0\nNote that for notational simplicity we will use the same letter M to denote the ergodic averages\nfor a contraction as well as for a semigroup. The precise meaning should be clear in the concrete\ncontext. Again, the mean ergodic theorem asserts that Mt (x) converges to F (x) in Lp (M) for all\nx \u2208 Lp (M) (1 < p < \u221e) , where F stands for the projection from Lp (M) onto the fixed point\nspace of (Tt ), i.e. the space {x \u2208 Lp (M) : Tt (x) = x, \u2200 t > 0}.\nThe following result due to Yeadon [Ye] will play an important role in this paper. P(M) denotes\nthe lattice of projetions in M. Given e \u2208 P(M), set e\u22a5 = 1 \u2212 e.\nLemma 1.2 Let T satisfy (0.I) - (0.III). Let x \u2208 L+\n1 (M). Then for any \u03bb > 0 there is e \u2208 P(M)\nsuch that\nkxk1\n.\nsup ke Mn (T )(x) ek\u221e \u2264 \u03bb and \u03c4 (e\u22a5 ) \u2264\n\u03bb\nn\u22650\nThe reader can easily recognize that this is a noncommutative analogue of the classical weak\ntype (1,1) maximal ergodic inequality. Yeadon's theorem has a martingale predecessor obtained\nby Cuculescu [Cu].\n\n2\n\nThe spaces Lp (M; l\u221e )\n\nA fundamental object of this paper is the noncommutative spaces Lp (M; l\u221e ). Given 1 \u2264 p \u2264\n\u221e, Lp (M; l\u221e ) is defined as the space of all sequences x = (xn )n\u22650 in Lp (M) which admit a\nfactorization of the following form: there are a, b \u2208 L2p (M) and y = (yn ) \u2282 L\u221e (M) such that\n\u2200 n \u2265 0.\n\nxn = ayn b,\nWe then define\n\n\b\nkxkLp(M;l\u221e ) = inf kak2p sup kyn k\u221e kbk2p ,\nn\u22650\n\nwhere the infimum runs over\n\u0001 all factorizations as above. One can (rather easily) check that\nLp (M; l\u221e ), k * kLp (M;l\u221e ) is a Banach space. These spaces are introduced in [P] and [Ju].\n(In [P], M is required to be hyperfinite.) To gain a very first understanding on Lp (M; l\u221e ), let\nus consider a positive sequence x = (xn ). Then one can show that x \u2208 Lp (M; l\u221e ) iff there are\n+\na \u2208 L+\np (M) and yn \u2208 L\u221e (M) such that\n1\n\n1\n\nxn = a 2 yn a 2 ,\n6\n\n\u2200 n \u2265 0.\n\n\fWe can clearly assume that the yn are positive contractions. Thus if x has a factorization as\n1/2\nabove, then xn \u2264 a for all n. Conversely, if xn \u2264 a for some a \u2208 L+\n= un a1/2 for\np (M), then xn\n1/2\n1/2 \u2217\na contraction un \u2208 M, and so xn = a un un a . Thus x \u2208 Lp (M; l\u221e ). In summary, a positive\nsequence x belongs to Lp (M; l\u221e ) iff there is a \u2208 L+\np (M) such that xn \u2264 a for all n, and moreover,\n\b\nkxkLp (M;l\u221e ) = inf kakp : a \u2208 L+\np (M) s.t. xn \u2264 a, \u2200 n \u2265 0 .\n\nConvention. The norm of x in Lp (M; l\u221e ) will be very often denoted by\n\nsup+\nn xn\n\np\n\n.\n\nWe should warn the reader that sup+\nn xn p is just a notation for supn xn does not make any\nsense in the noncommutative setting. We find, however, that sup+\nn xn p is more intuitive than\nkxkLp (M;l\u221e ) .\nIt is proved in [Ju] that Lp (M; l\u221e ) is a dual space for every p > 1. Its predual is Lp\u2032 (M; l1 )\n(p\u2032 being the index conjugate to p). Let us define this latter space. Given 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, a sequence\nx = (xn ) belongs to Lp (M; l1 ) if there are ukn , vkn \u2208 L2p (M) such that\nX\nxn =\nu\u2217kn vkn\nk\u22650\n\nfor all n and\n\nX\n\nk,n\u22650\n\nX\n\nu\u2217kn ukn \u2208 Lp (M),\n\nk,n\u22650\n\n\u2217\nvkn\nvkn \u2208 Lp (M).\n\nHere all series are required to be convergent in Lp (M) (relative to the w*-topology in the case of\np = \u221e). Lp (M; l1 ) is a Banach space when equipped with the norm\nn X\nX\n1o\n1\n\u2217\nvkn\nvkn p2 ,\nkxkLp (M;l1 ) = inf\nu\u2217kn ukn p2\nk,n\u22650\n\nk,n\u22650\n\nwhere the infimum is taken over all (ukn ) and (vkn ) as above. It is clear that finite sequences are\ndense in Lp (M; l1 ) if p < \u221e. The duality between Lp (M; l\u221e ) and Lp\u2032 (M; l1 ) is given by\nX\nhx, yi =\n\u03c4 (xn yn ).\nn\u22650\n\nAs previously for Lp (M; l\u221e ), it is easy to describe the\nP positive sequences in Lp (M; l1 ). In fact,\na positive sequence x = (xn ) belongs to Lp (M; l1 ) iff n xn \u2208 Lp (M). If this is the case,\nkxkLp (M;l1 ) =\n\nX\n\nxn\n\np\n\n.\n\nn\u22650\n\nCompare this equality (whose member on the right has the usual sense) with our previous convention for the norm in Lp (M; l\u221e ). This partly justifies the intuitive notation sup+\nn xn p .\nWe collect some elementary properties of these spaces in the following proposition. We denote\nby Lp (M; ln+1\n\u221e ) the subspace of Lp (M; l\u221e ) consisting of all finite sequences (x0 , x1 , * * * , xn , 0, * * * ).\nIn accordance with our preceding convention, the norm of x in Lp (M; ln+1\n\u221e ) will be denoted by\nn+1\nk sup+\n) of Lp (M; l1 ).\n0\u2264k\u2264n xk kp . Similarly, we introduce the subspace Lp (M; l1\nProposition 2.1 Let 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e.\ni) Each element in the unit ball of Lp (M; l\u221e ) (resp. Lp (M; l1 )) is a sum of sixteen (resp. eight)\npositive elements in the same ball.\n\n7\n\n\fii) A sequence x = (xn ) in Lp (M) belongs to Lp (M; l\u221e ) iff\nsup\nn\u22650\n\nsup+ xk\n\n0\u2264k\u2264n\n\np\n\n< \u221e.\n\nIf this is the case, then\nsup+ xn\nn\n\np\n\n= sup\nn\u22650\n\nsup+ xk\n\n0\u2264k\u2264n\n\np\n\n.\n\niii) Let x = (xn ) be a positive sequence in Lp (M; l\u221e ). Then\n\bX\nsup+ xn p = sup\n\u03c4 (xn yn ) : yn \u2208 L+\np\u2032 (M) and\nn\n\nn\n\nX\n\nyn\n\np\u2032\n\nn\n\n\u22641 .\n\niv) We have the following Cauchy-Schwarz type inequality: For any sequences (xn ) and (yn ) in\nL2p (M)\nsup+ x\u2217n yn\nn\n\np\n\n\u2264 sup+ x\u2217n xn\nn\n\n1\n2\n\np\n\nsup+ yn\u2217 yn\nn\n\n1\n2\n\np\n\n.\n\nProof. i) First note that both Lp (M; l\u221e ) and Lp (M; l1 ) are closed with respect to involution.\nThus we need only to consider selfadjoint elements. Let x be a selfadjoint element (i.e. xn = x\u2217n\nfor all n) in the unit ball of Lp (M; l\u221e ). Write a factorization of x:\nxn = a\u2217 yn b\n\nwith kak2p \u2264 1, kbk2p \u2264 1 and sup kyn k\u221e \u2264 1.\nn\n\nThen by a standard polorization argument,\nxn\n\n=\n\n=\n\n3\n\n3\n\nk=0\n\nk=0\n\n1 X \u2212k\n1X\ni (a + ik b)\u2217 yn (a + ik b) =\n(a + ik b)\u2217 zn (a + ik b)\n4\n4\n\n3\n3\nX\nX\na + ik b \u0001\u2217 + a + ik b \u0001\na + ik b \u0001\u2217 \u2212 a + ik b \u0001\nzn\n\u2212\nzn\n,\n2\n2\n2\n2\nk=0\n\nk=0\n\nwhere\n\ni\u2212k yn + (i\u2212k yn )\u2217\n.\n2\nHence the assertion concerning Lp (M; l\u221e ) follows. The one for Lp (M; l1 ) is proved similarly.\nii) It is trivial that\nsup sup+ xk p \u2264 sup+ xn p .\nzn =\n\nn\u22650\n\nn\n\n0\u2264k\u2264n\n\nTo prove the converse, we introduce the subspace Lp (M; l01 ) of Lp (M; l1 ), which consists of all\nfinite sequences x admitting a factorization as in the definition above of Lp (M; l1 ) but with finite\nfamilies (ukn ) and (vkn ) only. Note that for p < \u221e, Lp (M; l01 ) is dense in Lp (M; l1 ). Now\nP let x be a\n0\nsequence such that supn\u22650 sup+\nn \u03c4 (xn yn ).\n0\u2264k\u2264n xk p = 1. Define l : Lp\u2032 (M; l1 ) \u2192 C by l(y) =\nThen l is a continuous linear functional of norm \u2264 1. Thus if p > 1 (i.e. p\u2032 < \u221e), by the duality\nresult in [Ju] already quoted previously, l can be identified with an element of Lp (M; l\u221e ). This\nelement must be x, and so we are done in this case. It remains to consider the case p = 1. Using a\nstandard Hahn-Banach argument as presented in [Ju], we deduce two states \u03c6 and \u03c8 on M such\nthat\n\u00011\n\u00011\n|\u03c4 (xn u\u2217 v)| \u2264 \u03c6(u\u2217 u) 2 \u03c8(v \u2217 v) 2 , n \u2265 0, \u2200 u, v \u2208 M.\nSince xn \u2208 L1 (M) \u2243 M\u2217 is a normal functional, we can replace in the inequality above \u03c6 and \u03c8\nby their normal parts respectively, and so we can assume \u03c6 and \u03c8 already normal. (In fact, in the\npresent case, one can check that the singular parts of \u03c6 and \u03c8 are zero.) Identifying \u03c6 and \u03c8 with\n8\n\n\ftwo positive operators a and b in the unit ball of L1 (M), respectively, we rewrite the inequality\nabove as\n1\n1\nn \u2265 0, \u2200 u, v \u2208 M.\n|\u03c4 (xn u\u2217 v)| \u2264 kua 2 k2 kvb 2 k2 ,\n\nThen as in [Ju], we find contractions yn \u2208 M such that xn = b1/2 yn a1/2 . Therefore, x \u2208\nL1 (M; l\u221e ) and k sup+\nn xn k1 \u2264 1.\nNote that if additionally x is positive, in the Hahn-Banach argument above, we can use only\n0\n1/2\nthe positive cone L+\nyn a1/2 with a \u2208 L+\np (M) and\np\u2032 (M; l1 ) to get a factorization of x as xn = a\nyn positive contractions. See [Ju] for more details.\niii) For p > 1 this is already proved in [Ju]. For p = 1 this is a consequence of ii) and the\nprevious remark.\niv) We use duality. Let (ukn ) and (vkn ) be two finite families in L2p\u2032 (M). Then by the\nCauchy-Schwarz inequality\nX\nX\nX\n\u00011\n\u00011\n\u2217\nyn u\u2217kn ukn yn\u2217 2\n\u03c4 (x\u2217n yn u\u2217kn vkn ) \u2264 \u03c4\nxn vkn\nvkn x\u2217n 2 \u03c4\nk,n\n\nk,n\n\nk,n\n\n\u2264\n\n1\n\n1\n\nsup+ yn\u2217 yn p2\nn\n\nsup+ x\u2217n xn p2\nn\n\nX\n\n\u2217\nvkn\nvkn\n\nk,n\n\n1\n2\n\np\u2032\n\nX\n\nu\u2217kn ukn\n\n1\n2\n\np\u2032\n\n.\n\nk,n\n\nwhence the desired inequality.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 2.2 i) From the proof of part ii) above, one sees that the infimum defining the norm\nk supn xn kp is attained for any x \u2208 Lp (M; l\u221e ) (1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e). The same proof shows that L1 (M; l\u221e )\nis identified as an isometric subspace of the dual of L\u221e (M; l01 ).\nii) We have a statement similar to Proposition 2.1, ii) for Lp (M; l1 ). On the other hand, let\nLp (M; c0 ) be the closure of finite sequences in Lp (M; l\u221e ) for 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. Then one can show that\nthe dual space of Lp (M; c0 ) is equal to Lp\u2032 (M; l1 ) isometrically.\niii) Neither Lp (M; l\u221e ) nor Lp (M; l1 ) is stable under the operation (xn )n 7\u2192 (|xn |)n . Thus\n+\nk sup+\nn xn kp 6= k supn |xn | kp in general.\nRemark 2.3 If N \u2282 M is a von Neumann subalgebra such that the trace \u03c4 restricted to N is\nsemifinite on N , then we have a natural isometric inclusion Lp (N ) \u2282 Lp (M). This extends to\nisometric inclusions:\nLp (N ; l\u221e ) \u2282 Lp (M; l\u221e )\n\nand Lp (N ; l1 ) \u2282 Lp (M; l1 ) .\n\nIndeed, by the definition of Lp (M; , l\u221e ) and Lp (M; l1 ), the inclusions above are contractive. On\nthe other hand, the duality result from the preceding proposition and remarks imply immediately\nthat they are both isometric.\nRemark 2.4 The definition of Lp (M; l\u221e ) and Lp (M; l1 ) can be extended to an arbitrary index\nset. Let I be an index set. Then Lp (M; l\u221e (I)) and Lp (M; l1 (I)) are defined similarly as before.\nFor instance, Lp (M; l\u221e (I)) consists of all families (xi )i\u2208I in Lp (M) which can be factorized as\nxi = ayi b with a, b \u2208 L2p (M) and a bounded family (yi )i\u2208I \u2282 L\u221e (M). The norm of (xi )i\u2208I in\nLp (M; l\u221e ) is defined as the infimum\ninf kak2p sup kyi k\u221e kbk2p\ni\n\nrunning over all factorizations as above. As before, this norm is also denoted by\nsup+ xi\ni\n\np\n\n.\n\nAgain the dual space of Lp (M; l1 (I)) for p < \u221e is Lp\u2032 (M; l\u221e (I)). Proposition 2.1 remains true\nin this general setting.\n9\n\n\fWe end this section with a simple result on complex interpolation of these vector-valued noncommutative Lp -spaces.\nProposition 2.5 Let 1 \u2264 p0 < p1 \u2264 \u221e and 0 < \u03b8 < 1. Then we have isometrically\n\u0001\n\u0001\nLp (M; l1 ) = Lp0 (M; l1 ), Lp1 (M; l1 ) \u03b8 , Lp (M; l\u221e ) = Lp0 (M; l\u221e ), Lp1 (M; l\u221e ) \u03b8 ,\nwhere\n\n1\np\n\n=\n\n1\u2212\u03b8\np0\n\n+\n\n\u03b8\np1 .\n\nProof. We use the column and row spaces Lp (M; lc2 (N2 )) and Lp (M; lr2 (N2 )) (cf. [PX1] for the\ndefinition). It is known that {Lp (M; lc2 (N2 ))}1\u2264p\u2264\u221e form an interpolation scale with respect to\nthe complex interpolation. The same is true for the row spaces. Note that by the definition of\nLp (M; l1 ), the bilinear map\nB :\n\nLp (M; lr2 (N2 ))\n\u0001\nukn k,n\u22650\n\n\u00d7 Lp (M; lc2 (N2 )) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M; l1 )\nX\n\u0001\n\u0001\nukn vkn n\u22650\n\u00d7\nvkn k,n\u22650 7\u2212\u2192\nk\n\nis contractive (in fact, Lp (M; l1 ) is just the quotient space of Lp (M; lr2 (N2 )) \u00d7 Lp (M; lc2 (N2 )) by\nthe kernel of B). Thus by the complex interpolation for bilinear maps (cf. [BeL]), we deduce that\n\u0001\nB : Lp (M; lr2 (N2 )) \u00d7 Lp (M; lc2 (N2 )) \u2192 Lp0 (M; l1 ), Lp1 (M; l1 ) \u03b8\nis contractive. This yields\n\n\u0001\nLp (M; l1 ) \u2282 Lp0 (M; l1 ), Lp1 (M; l1 ) \u03b8 ,\n\n(2.1)\n\na contractive inclusion.\n\nSimilarly, using the complex interpolation for trilinear maps, we obtain the following contractive\ninclusion\n\u0001\n(2.2)\nLp (M; l\u221e ) \u2282 Lp0 (M; l\u221e ), Lp1 (M; l\u221e ) \u03b8 .\n\nAlternatively, this can be easily proved by using directly the factorization of elements in Lp (M; l\u221e ).\nDualizing the corresponding inclusion of (2.1) for finite sequences, we get\n\u0001\u2217 \u0001\u03b8\n\u2282 Lp\u2032 (M; ln\u221e ),\nLp\u20320 (M; ln\u221e ), Lp1 (M; ln1 )\n\nwhere (*, *)\u03b8 denotes Calderon's second complex interpolation method. However,\n\nIt follows that\n\n\u0001\u2217 \u0001\u03b8\n\u0001\u2217 \u0001\n.\nLp\u20320 (M; ln\u221e ), Lp1 (M; ln1 ) \u03b8 \u2282 Lp\u20320 (M; ln\u221e ), Lp1 (M; ln1 )\n\u0001\u2217 \u0001\nLp\u20320 (M; ln\u221e ), Lp1 (M; ln1 ) \u03b8 \u2282 Lp\u2032 (M; ln\u221e ).\n\n\u0001\u2217\nSince Lp\u20320 (M; ln\u221e ) \u2229 Lp1 (M; ln1 ) is dense in the complex interpolation space on the left and\nwe deduce that\n\n\u0001\u2217\nLp\u20320 (M; ln\u221e ) \u2229 Lp1 (M; ln1 ) Lp\u20320 (M; ln\u221e ) \u2229 Lp\u20321 (M; ln\u221e ),\n\n\u0001\nLp\u20320 (M; ln\u221e ), Lp\u20321 (M; ln\u221e ) \u03b8 \u2282 Lp\u2032 (M; ln\u221e ),\n\nReformulating this for the indices p0 , p1 , we have\n\u0001\nLp0 (M; ln\u221e ), Lp1 (M; ln\u221e ) \u03b8 \u2282 Lp (M; ln\u221e ),\n10\n\na contractive inclusion.\n\na contractive inclusion.\n\n\f\u00bfFrom this we easily get the same inclusion \u0001for infinite sequence spaces. Indeed, let x = (xk )k\u22650\nbe an element in Lp0 (M; l\u221e ), Lp1 (M; l\u221e ) \u03b8 of norm \u2264 1 and let x(n) = (x0 , x1 , ..., xn , 0, 0, ...).\n\u0001\nn+1\n(n)\n\u2208 Lp (M; ln+1\nThen x(n) \u2208 Lp0 (M; ln+1\n\u221e ) and is\n\u221e ), Lp1 (M; l\u221e ) \u03b8 and is of norm \u2264 1. Thus x\nof norm \u2264 1. Consequently,\nsup x(n) Lp (M;l\u221e ) \u2264 1.\nn\n\nTherefore, by Proposition 2.1, ii), we deduce that x belongs to the unit ball of Lp (M; l\u221e ), and so\nby homogeneity, we obtain the converse inclusion of (2.2).\nThe converse inclusion of (2.1) can be proved similarly. But this time instead of Proposition\n\u0001\n2.1, it suffices to use the fact that finite sequences are dense in Lp0 (M; l1 ), Lp1 (M; l1 ) \u03b8 . We\nomit the details.\n\u0003\nRemark. In a forthcoming paper we will show that the interpolation equalities in Proposition 2.5\nare no longer true for the real interpolation. This is one of the difficulties we will encounter for\nproving the Marcinkiewicz type theorem in the next section.\n\n3\n\nAn interpolation theorem\n\nThe main result of this section is a Marcinkiewicz type interpolation theorem for Lp (M; l\u221e ). It\nis the key to our proof of the noncommutative maximal ergodic inequalities. We first introduce\n+\nthe following notion. For every integer n \u2265 0 assume given a map Sn : L+\np (M) \u2192 L0 (M). Set\nS = (Sn )n\u22650 . Thus S is a map which sends positive operators to sequences of positive operators.\nWe say that S is of weak type (p, p) (p < \u221e) if there is a positive constant C such that for any\nx \u2208 L+\np (M) and any \u03bb > 0 there is a projection e \u2208 M such that\n\u0002 kxkp \u0003p\n\u03c4 (e\u22a5 ) \u2264 C\n\u03bb\n\n\u0001\nand e Sn (x) e \u2264 \u03bb , \u2200 n \u2265 0.\n\nSimilarly, we say that S is of type (p, p) (this time p may be equal to \u221e) if there is a positive\n+\nconstant C such that for any x \u2208 L+\np (M) there is a \u2208 Lp (M) satisfying\nkakp \u2264 C kxkp\n\nand Sn (x) \u2264 a, \u2200 n \u2265 0.\n\nIn other words, S is of type (p, p) iff\nkS(x)kLp (M; l\u221e ) \u2264 C kxkp ,\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 L+\np (M).\n\n\u0001\nTheorem 3.1 Let 1 \u2264 p0 < p1 \u2264 \u221e. Let S = Sn n\u22650 be a sequence of maps from L+\np0 (M) +\n+\n+\nLp1 (M) into L0 (M). Assume that S is subadditive in the sense that Sn (x + y) \u2264 Sn (x) + Sn (y)\nfor all n \u2208 N. If S is of weak type (p0 , p0 ) with constant C0 and of type (p1 , p1 ) with constant C1 ,\nthen for any p0 < p < p1 , S is of type (p, p) with constant Cp satisfying\n(3.1)\n\nCp \u2264 C C01\u2212\u03b8 C1\u03b8\n\n1 \u0001\u22122\n1\n,\n\u2212\np0\np\n\nwhere \u03b8 is determined by 1/p = (1 \u2212 \u03b8)/p0 + \u03b8/p1 and C is a universal constant.\nThe reader can easily recognize that this result is a noncommutative analogue of the classical\nMarcinkiewicz interpolation theorem. Recall that in the classical case the constant Cp is majorized\n\u0001\u22121\n, i.e. without the square in (3.1). We will see later that the estimate given\nby C01\u2212\u03b8 C1\u03b8 1/p0 \u22121/p\nby (3.1) is optimal in the noncommutative setting. This difference indicates that though similar\nin form to the classical Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem, Theorem 3.1 cannot be proved by\nthe standard argument in the commutative case. The rest of this section is entirely devoted to its\n11\n\n\fproof. In the following S will be fixed as in the theorem above; p will denote a number such that\np0 < p < p1 , and \u03b8 is determined by 1/p = (1 \u2212 \u03b8)/p0 + \u03b8/p1 . C will stand for a universal constant.\nThe following lemma is entirely elementary.\nLemma 3.2 Let (xij ) be a finite matrix of bounded operators on a Hilbert space H. Let (ei ) and\n(fi ) be two sequences of pairwise disjoint projections in B(H). Then\nX\n\u0001\nei xij fj B(H) \u2264 kei xij fj kB(H) i,j B(l2 ) .\ni,j\n\nProof. Let \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 H.

Thus we have completed the proof of Theorem 3.1.\n\u0003\n\n4\n\nMaximal ergodic inequalities\n\nThe following is our main maximal ergodic inequality in noncommutative Lp -spaces. Restricted to\nthe positive cone L+\np (M), it becomes Theorem 0.1, i). Recall that for a map T with (0.I) - (0.III),\nT also denotes its extensions to Lp (M) given by Lemma 1.1.\nTheorem 4.1 Let T be a linear map with (0.I) - (0.III). Let\nn\n1 X k\nMn \u2261 Mn (T ) =\nT .\nn+1\nk=0\n\nThen for every 1 < p \u2264 \u221e we have\n(4.1)\n\nsup+ Mn (x)\nn\n\np\n\n\u2264 Cp kxkp ,\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 Lp (M).\n\nMoreover, Cp \u2264 C p2 (p \u2212 1)\u22122 and this is the optimal order of Cp as p \u2192 1.\n\n18\n\n\fProof. Decomposing an operator into a linear combination of four positive ones, we can assume\n+\n+\nx \u2208 L+\np (M). Now consider each Mn as a map defined on L1 (M) + L\u221e (M). Then Mn is positive\nand additive (and so subadditive too). Let M = (Mn )n\u22650 . Yeadon's inequality says that M is of\nweak type (1,1). On the other hand, M is trivially of type (\u221e, \u221e) with constant 1. Therefore, by\nTheorem 3.1, M is of type (p, p) for every 1 < p < \u221e with constant Cp verifying\nCp \u2264 C 1 \u2212\n\n1 \u0001\u22122\n.\np\n\nThus we have proved (4.1). The optimality of this estimate follows from the optimal order of\nthe best constant in the noncommutative Doob maximal inequality obtained in [JX3] and the\nfollowing useful lemma due to Neveu, whose validity in the noncommutative setting was observed\nby Dang-Ngoc [Da].\nLemma 4.2 Let (Mn )n\u22650 be a decreasing sequence of von Neumann subalgebras of M. Assume\nthat for every n there is a normal faithful conditional expectation En from M onto Mn such that\n\u03c4 \u25e6 En = \u03c4 . Let (\u03b1n ) be an incresing sequence in [0, 1) with \u03b10 = 0. The the map\nX\nT =\n(\u03b1n+1 \u2212 \u03b1n )En\nn\u22650\n\nsatisfies all conditions (0.I) - (0.IV). Moreover, given any \u03b5 > 0 one can choose (\u03b1n ) and an\nincreasing sequence (mn ) of positive integers such that\nX\nMmn (T ) \u2212 En < \u03b5,\nn\u22650\n\nwhere the norm is relative to Lp (M) for any 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e.\nNote that if additionally limn \u03b1n = 1, T preserves the trace \u03c4 for the En preserve \u03c4 . With\nthe help of this lemma, one sees that the noncommutative maximal inequality (4.1) implies the\nnoncommutative Doob maximal inequality proved in [Ju] and \u03b4p \u2264 Cp , where \u03b4p is the best constant\nin the latter inequality. On the other hand, it was shown in [JX3] that the optimal order of \u03b4p is\n(p \u2212 1)\u22122 as p \u2192 1. It then follows that the estimate for Cp in (4.1) is optimal. Theorem 4.1 is\nthus proved.\n\u0003\nRemark. The optimal order of the constant Cp in (4.1) implies that the estimate given in (3.1)\nis the best possible as p \u2192 p0 (with p0 = 1). Recall that in the commutative case the best Cp in\n(4.1) is of order (p \u2212 1)\u22121 as p \u2192 1. This explains partly the extra (noncommutative) effort in\ngetting (4.1).\nWe will see in section 6 that Theorem 4.1 implies the ergodic averages (Mn (x))n converge\nbilaterally almost uniformly for any x \u2208 Lp (M). However, for p > 2 the bilateral almost uniform\nconvergence can be improved to the almost uniform convergence. This improvement will be a\nconsequence of the following corollary of Theorem 4.1. For the formulation of this result we need\na further notation from [Mu, DJ1]. Let 2 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e and I be an index set. We define the\nspace Lp (M; lc\u221e (I)) as the family of all (xi )i\u2208I \u2282 Lp (M) for which there are a \u2208 Lp (M) and\n(yi )i\u2208I \u2282 L\u221e (M) such that\nxi = yi a and sup kyi k\u221e < \u221e.\ni\u2208I\n\nk(xi )kLp (M;lc\u221e (I)) is then defined to be the infumum {supi\u2208I kyi k\u221e kakp } over all factorizations of\n(xi ) as above. It is easy to check that k kLp(M;lc\u221e (I)) is a norm, which makes Lp (M; lc\u221e (I)) a\nBanach space. Note that (xi ) \u2208 Lp (M; lc\u221e (I)) iff (x\u2217i xi ) \u2208 L 2p (M; l\u221e (I)). If I = N, Lp (M; lc\u221e (I))\nis simply denoted by Lp (M; lc\u221e )\n19\n\n\fCorollary 4.3 Let T be as in Theorem 4.1 and 2 < p \u2264 \u221e. Then\nq\n\u0001\nMn (x) n\u22650 Lp (M;lc ) \u2264 Cp/2 kxkp , \u2200 x \u2208 Lp (M).\n\u221e\n\nProof. Let x \u2208 Lp (M). By decomposing x into its real and imaginary parts, we can assume x\nselfadjoint. Since T is positive, so is Mn for every n. Thus by the classical Kadison inequality [Ka],\nwe have\n(Mn (x))2 \u2264 Mn (x2 ).\n\nThus applying Theorem 4.1 to x2 \u2208 Lp/2 (M) we get b \u2208 L+\np/2 (M) such that\nkbkp/2 \u2264 Cp/2 kx2 kp/2\n\nand Mn (x2 ) \u2264 b,\n\n\u2200 n \u2265 0.\n\nHence (Mn (x))2 \u2264 b. It then follows that for each n there is \u0001a contraction yn \u2208 M such that\nMn (x) = yn b1/2 . This gives the desired factorization of Mn (x) n\u22650 as an element in Lp (M; lc\u221e )\nand thus proves the corollary.\n\u0003\nThe following maximal inequality for multiple ergodic averages is an easy consequence of Theorem 4.1.\nCorollary 4.4 Let T1 , ... , Td be d maps satisfying (0.I) - (0.III).

We show only the first inequality in i). Recall that the semigroup (Tt )t\u22650 is strongly\ncontinuous on Lp (M), i.e. for any x \u2208 Lp (M) the function t 7\u2192 Tt (x) is continuous from [0, \u221e)\nto Lp (M), and so is the function t 7\u2192 Mt (x). Thus to prove the first inequality in i) it suffices\nto consider Mt (x) for t in a dense subset of (0, \u221e), for instance, the subset {n2\u2212m : m, n \u2208 N}.\nUsing once more the strong continuity of (Tt )t\u22650 , we can replace the integral defining Mt (x) by a\nRiemann sum. Thus we have approximately\nMn2\u2212m (x)\n\n=\n\n\u2212m\nn\u22121 Z\n1 X (k+1)2\nTs (x) ds\nn2\u2212m\nk2\u2212m\n\nk=0\n\n\u2248\n\n1\nn\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\nTk2\u2212m (x) = Mn\u22121 (T2\u2212m )(x).\n\nk=0\n\nThus by Theorem 4.1 applied to T = T2\u2212m , we obtain\nsup+ Mn2\u2212m (x)\nn\n\np\n\n\u2264 Cp kxkp .\n\nSince the subsets {n2\u2212m : n \u2208 N} are increasing in m, by Proposition 2.1, we get\nsup+ Mn2\u2212m (x)\nm,n\n\np\n\n\u2264 Cp kxkp .\n\nThis is the desired inequality.\n\n\u0003\n\nIt is easy to show that the ergodic averages in Theorem 4.5 can be replaced by many other\naverages. Let us consider, for instance, the Poisson semigroup subordinated to (Tt ):\nZ \u221e \u2212u\n1\ne\n\u221a Tt2 /4u du.\n(4.2)\nPt = \u221a\n\u03c0 0\nu\nRecall that if A denotes the infinitesimal generator of (Tt ), then that of (Pt ) is \u2212(\u2212A)1/2 . More\ngenerally, given any 0 < \u03b1 < 1, we can consider a semigroup (Pt ) subordinated to (Tt ) via the\nfollowing formula:\nZ \u221e\n\u03c6(s)Tt\u03b2 s ds,\n(4.3)\nPt =\n0\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/\u03b1 and \u03c6 is the function on R+ defined by\nZ \u221e\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c6(s) =\nexp st cos \u03b8 \u2212 t\u03b1 cos(\u03b1\u03b8) \u00d7 sin st sin \u03b8 \u2212 t\u03b1 cos(\u03b1\u03b8) + \u03b8 dt,\n0\n\n\u03b8 being any number in [\u03c0/2, \u03c0]. When \u03b1 = 1/2, (4.3) reduces to (4.2). Note that the infinitesimal\ngenerator of (Pt ) in (4.3) is \u2212(\u2212A)\u03b1 (see [Yo, IX]).\n\n21\n\n\fCorollary 4.6 Let (Tt ) be a semigroup verifying (0.I) - (0.III). Let 0 < \u03b1 < 1 and (Pt ) be the\nsemigroup subordinated to (Tt ) as in (4.3). Then for 1 < p \u2264 \u221e\nsup+ Pt (x)\n\n(4.4)\n\nt\n\nand for 2 < p < \u221e\n\n\u0001\nPt (x) t>0\n\np\n\n\u2264 C\u03b1,p kxkp ,\n\nLp (M;lc\u221e (R+ ))\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 Lp (M)\n\n\u2032\n\u2264 C\u03b1,p\nkxkp ,\n\nProof. Let us first rewrite (4.3) as\nZ \u221e\nZ\nPt = t\u2212\u03b2\n\u03c6(t\u2212\u03b2 s)Ts ds = t\u2212\u03b2\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 Lp (M).\n\n\u03c6(t\u2212\u03b2 s)\n\n0\n\nd\n(sMs ) ds.\nds\n\nThus by integration by parts,\nZ\n\nPt = t\u2212\u03b2\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03c6\u2032 (t\u2212\u03b2 s) t\u2212\u03b2 s Ms ds =\n\n0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ns\u03c6\u2032 (s) Mt\u03b2 s ds.\n\n0\n\nTherefore, by Theorem 4.5, i), for any x \u2208 Lp (M)\nZ \u221e\nsup+ Pt (x) \u2264 Cp\ns|\u03c6\u2032 (s)| ds kxkp .\nt\n\n0\n\nIt is easy to see that the integral on the right is finite by virtue of the definition of \u03c6. Thus we\nhave proved (4.4). In the same way, we get the second inequality.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.7 Let (Tt ) be a semigroup as in Theorem 4.5, i). Using Lemma 1.2 and the preceding\ndiscretization argument, one can easily obtained the following weak type (1,1) inequality: for any\nx \u2208 L+\n1 (M) and \u03bb > 0 there is a projection e \u2208 M such that\nsup eMt (x)e\nt>0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2264 \u03bb and \u03c4 (e\u22a5 ) \u2264\n\nkxk1\n.\n\u03bb\n\nMoreover, Mt in the inequality above can be replaced by Pt in (4.3).\n\n5\n\nMaximal inequalities for symmetric contractions\n\nThe main result of this section is the following, which is a reformulation of Theorem 0.1, ii) for\ngeneral elements in Lp (M).\nTheorem 5.1 Let T be a linear map on M satisfying (0.I) - (0.IV). Then for any 1 < p < \u221e we\nhave\n(5.1)\n\nsup+ T n (x)\nn\n\np\n\n\u2264 Cp\u2032 kxkp ,\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 Lp (M),\n\nwhere Cp\u2032 is a constant depending only on p.\nThis is the noncommutative analogue of a classical inequality due to Stein (cf. [St1]; see\nalso [St2, Chapter III]). Stein's approach is via complex interpolation. The main ingredient is the\nmaximal ergodic inequality (4.1), which allows to deduce similar maximal inequalities for fractional\naverages. We refer to [Sta] (and the references therein) for more general maximal inequalities based\non Rota's dilation theorem. (We are grateful to the referee for bringing [Sta] to our attention.)\nLet us point out that Rota's theorem is not sufficiently understood in the noncommutative setting\nand hence Starr's method is not yet available. It is Stein's original approach that suits well to the\n22\n\n\fnoncommutative setting. Thus we will follow the same pattern as in [St2, Chapter III]. Throughout\nthe remainder of this section T will be fixed as in Theorem 5.1.\nWe begin by introducing the fractional averages on the powers of T . Given a complex number\n\u03b1 and a nonnegative integer n, set\nA\u03b1\nn =\nand\nSn\u03b1 \u2261 Sn\u03b1 (T ) =\nMn\u03b1\n\nn\nX\n\n(\u03b1 + 1)(\u03b1 + 2) * * * (\u03b1 + n)\nn!\n\nk\nA\u03b1\u22121\nn\u2212k T ,\n\nMn\u03b1 \u2261 Mn\u03b1 (T ) = (n + 1)\u2212\u03b1 Sn\u03b1 .\n\nk=0\n\nThe\nare the so-called fractional averages of the T k . Note that Mn0 = T n and Mn1 is the usual\nergodic average Mn already considered before. Also if \u03b1 is a negative integer \u2212m, then\n\u0001\nk\nSn\u2212m = \u2206m\nn (T )k\u22650 ,\n\nwhere \u2206n denotes the first difference map on sequences, i.e.\n\u2206n (a) = an \u2212 an\u22121\n\nm\u22121\nfor every sequence a = (an ). Then \u2206m\n) is defined by induction and is the difference\nn = \u2206n (\u2206n\nmap of order m. Here and in the sequel we adopt the convention that for any sequence (an )n\u22650\nk\nwe put an = 0 for n < 0. Since we will only consider actions of \u2206m\nn on the sequence (T )k\u22650 , we\nwill simply put\n\u0001\nk\nm\n\u2206m\nn = \u2206n (T )k\u22650 .\n\nThus Mn\u2212m = (n + 1)m \u2206m\nn.\n\nWe will need a generalization of Theorem 5.1.\nTheorem 5.2 Let T be as in Theorem 5.1 with the additional assumption that T is positive as an\noperator on L2 (M) (i.e. hx, T xi = \u03c4 (x\u2217 T x) \u2265 0 for all x \u2208 L2 (M)). Then for all \u03b1 \u2208 C and\np \u2208 (1, \u221e) we have\nsup+ Mn\u03b1 (x)\n\n(5.2)\n\nn\n\np\n\n\u2264 C\u03b1,p kxkp ,\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 Lp (M) ,\n\nwhere C\u03b1,p is a constant depending only on \u03b1 and p.\nIt is easy to see that Theorem 5.2 implies Theorem 5.1. Indeed, applying Theorem 5.2 to T 2\nwith \u03b1 = 0, we get\nsup+ T 2n (x)\nn\n\np\n\n\u2264 Cp\u2032 kxkp\n\nand\n\nsup+ T 2n+1 (x)\nn\n\np\n\n\u2264 Cp\u2032 kT xkp \u2264 Cp\u2032 kxkp\n\nfor every x \u2208 Lp (M). Thus (5.1) follows.\nAs already said before, our proof of Theorem 5.2 will follow the pattern set up by Stein. The\nmain steps are as follows. First, using Theorem 4.1, we show that (5.2) holds for all complex \u03b1\nwhose real part is greater than 1. Then with the help of the discrete Littlewood-Paley function,\nwe deduce (5.2) for p = 2 and for all non positive integers \u03b1. It is this L2 result which demands\nthe symmetry of T . For interpolation we need to modify slightly this L2 result into another one,\ni.e. to prove (5.2) for p = 2 again and for all complex \u03b1 whose real part is of the form \u2212m + 1/2\nwith m \u2208 N. Finally, complex interpolation permits us to conclude the proof.\nWe will use the following elementary properties of the A\u03b1\nn : for all \u03b1 \u2208 C and \u03b2 > \u22121\n\n(5.3)\n\nA\u03b1\nn =\n\nn\nX\n\nk=0\n\nA\u03b1\u22121\n,\nk\n\n\u03b1\u22121\nA\u03b1\n= A\u03b1\nn \u2212 An\nn\u22121 ,\n\n23\n\nA\u03b2n \u2264 c\u03b2 (n + 1)\u03b2 ,\n\n\fwhere c\u03b2 is a positive constant depending only on \u03b2 (noting that A\u03b2n > 0 when \u03b2 > \u22121). The\nreader is referred to [Z, Vol.I, Chapter III.1] for these formulas. The following estimates on A\u03b1\nn are\nalso well-known.\nLemma 5.3 Let \u03b1 = \u03b2 + i\u03b3 \u2208 C.\n2\n\u03b2\ni) If \u03b2 = m + r with m \u2208 Z and 0 < r < 1, then |A\u03b1\nn | \u2264 exp(cr \u03b3 ) |An |.\n2\n\u03b2\nii) If \u03b2 > \u22121, then |A\u03b1\nn | \u2264 exp(c\u03b2 \u03b3 ) An .\n\nProof.

To this end we first need an appropriate analogue for the\nnoncommutative setting of the usual almost everywhere convergence. This is the almost uniform\nconvergence introduced by Lance [L] (see also [Ja1]).\nDefinition 6.1 Let M be a von Neumann algebra equipped with a semifinite normal faithful trace\n\u03c4 .

However they are different in the\nnoncommutative setting. Similarly, we introduce these notions of convergence for functions with\nvalues in L0 (M) and for nets in L0 (M).\nIn order to deduce the individual ergodic theorems from the corresponding maximal ergodic\ntheorems, it is convenient to use the subspace Lp (M; c0 ) of Lp (M; l\u221e ). Lp (M; c0 ) is defined as the\nspace of all sequences (xn ) \u2282 Lp (M) such that there are a, b \u2208 L2p (M) and (yn ) \u2282 M verifying\nxn = ayn b\n\nand\n\nlim kyn k\u221e = 0.\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nIt is easy to check that Lp (M; c0 ) is a closed subspace of Lp (M; l\u221e ) and\n\b\nsup+ xn p = inf kak2p sup kyn k\u221e kbk2p ,\nn\n\nn\u22650\n\nwhere the infimum runs over all factorizations of (xn ) as above. We define similarly the subspace\nLp (M; cc0 ) of Lp (M; lc\u221e ). Note that Lp (M; c0 ) (resp. Lp (M; cc0 )) is just the closure in Lp (M; l\u221e )\n(resp. Lp (M; lc\u221e )) of finite sequences in Lp (M) for 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. The definition of these spaces is\nreadily extended to any index set instead of N.\nThe following simple lemma from [DJ1] will be useful for our study of individual ergodic theorems.

Fix x \u2208 L2 (M) and \u03b5 > 0. By decomposing x into its real and imaginary part, we can\nassume x selfadjoint. Let (\u03b5n ) and (\u03b4n ) be two sequences of small positive numbers. Then for each\nm \u2265 1 there are wm \u2208 L2 (M) \u2229 L\u221e (M) and zm \u2208 L2 (M) such that\nx = F (x) + ym + zm\n\nym = wm \u2212 T (wm )\n\nwith\n\nand kzm k2 < \u03b4m .\n\nSince x is selfadjoint, wm , ym and zm can be chosen selfadjoint too. We have\nMn (x) \u2212 F (x) = Mn (ym ) + Mn (zm )\nand\nkMn (ym )k\u221e \u2264\n\n2\nkwm k\u221e .\nn+1\n\n2\nNow we apply Yeadon's weak type (1,1) inequality (Lemma 1.2) to zm\n. Thus there is a projection\nem such that\n2\nsup em Mn (zm\n)em\nn\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2264 \u03b52m\n\n\u22122\n2\n\u22122 2\nand \u03c4 (e\u22a5\nm ) < \u03b5m \u03c4 (zm ) \u2264 \u03b5m \u03b4m .\n\nBy Kadison's Cauchy-Schwarz inequality [Ka], we get\nMn (zm )em\n\n2\n\u221e\n\n2\n\u2264 em Mn (zm\n)em\n\n\u221e\n\n.\n\nThus\nsup Mn (zm )em\nLet e =\n\nV\n\nm\n\nn\n\nem . Then\n\u03c4 (e\u22a5 ) \u2264\n\nX\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2264 \u03b5m .\n\n2\n\u03b5\u22122\nm \u03b4m < \u03b5\n\nm\u22651\n\nprovided \u03b5m and \u03b4m are appropriately chosen. On the other hand, by the preceding inequalities,\nwe deduce\ne[Mn (x) \u2212 F (x)]e\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2264\n=\n\n2\nkwm k\u221e + keMn (zm )ek\u221e\nn+1\n2\n2\nkwm k\u221e + ke[em Mn (zm )em ]ek\u221e \u2264\nkwm k\u221e + \u03b5m .\nn+1\nn+1\n31\n\n\fIt then follows that\nlim sup e[Mn (x) \u2212 F (x)]e\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\u2264 \u03b5m .\n\n\u221e\n\nSince limm \u03b5m = 0, we get that limn\u21920 ke[Mn (x) \u2212 F (x)]ek\u221e = 0. Hence, Mn (x) converges to\nF (x) b.a.u..\n\u0003\nWe pass to the multiple version of Theorem 6.3 and Corollary 6.4. Let T1 , ... , Td be d maps\nsatisfying (0.I) - (0.III). As before, set\nMn1 ,... ,nd =\n\nd\n\u0002Y\n\nj=1\n\nnd\nn1\nX\n1 \u0003X\n***\nTdkd * * * T1k1 .\nnj + 1\nkd =0\n\nk1 =0\n\nLet Fj be the projection onto the fixed point subspace of Tj .\nTheorem 6.6 Let T1 , ... , Td be d maps satisfying (0.I) - (0.III). Let 1 < p < \u221e and x \u2208 Lp (M).\nThen\n\u0001\nMn1 , ..., nd (x) \u2212 Fd * * * F1 (x) n1 , ..., n \u22651 \u2208 Lp (M; c0 (Nd ))\nd\n\nand if p > 2,\n\n\u0001\nMn1 , ..., nd (x) \u2212 Fd * * * F1 (x) n\n\n1 , ..., nd \u22651\n\n\u2208 Lp (M; cc0 (Nd )).\n\nConsequently, Mn1 ,... ,nd (x) converges b.a.u. to Fd * * * F1 (x) as n1 , ..., nd tend to \u221e. Moreover, the\nconvergence is a.u. in the case of p > 2.\nProof. This proof is similar to that of Theorem 6.3, modulo an iteration argument. We consider\nonly the typical case d = 2. Note that\nMn1 ,n2 = Mn2 (T2 )Mn1 (T1 ).\nFix x \u2208 Lp (M) and decompose x as x = F1 (x) + yk + uk with\n\u0001\nyk \u2208 (I \u2212 T1 ) L1 (M) \u2229 L\u221e (M) ,\n\nuk \u2208 Lp (M),\n\n\u0001\nzk \u2208 (I \u2212 T2 ) (L1 (M) \u2229 L\u221e (M) ,\n\nvk \u2208 Lp (M),\n\nkuk kp \u2264\n\n1\n.\nk\n\nSimilarly, we decompose F1 (x) with respect to T2 : F1 (x) = F2 (F1 (x)) + zk + vk with\nkvk kp \u2264\n\n1\n.\nk\n\nApplying successively Mn1 (T1 ) to x and Mn2 (T2 ) to F1 (x), we get\nMn1 ,n2 (x) \u2212 F2 F1 (x) = Mn1 ,n2 (yk ) + Mn1 ,n2 (uk ) + Mn2 (T2 )(zk ) + Mn2 (T2 )(vk ) .\nBy Corollary 4.4,\nsup+ Mn1 ,n2 (uk )\nn1 ,n2\n\np\n\n\u2264 Cp2 kuk kp \u2264\n\nCp2\n\u2192 0 as k \u2192 \u221e.\nk\n\nSimilarly,\nlim\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nsup+ Mn2 (T2 )(vk )\nn2\n\np\n\n= 0.\n\nTherefore, as in the proof of Theorem 6.3, we need only to show\n\u0001\n\u0001\nMn1 ,n2 (yk ) n1 ,n2 \u22651 \u2208 Lp (M; c0 (N2 )) and Mn2 (zk ) n2 \u22651 \u2208 Lp (M; c0 ).\n\nTheorem 6.3 implies the latter. The former is proved by the arguments in the proof of Theorem\n6.3. Thus the first part of the theorem is proved. The second on p > 2 is left to the reader.\nThen applying Lemma 6.2 to multiple sequences, we deduce the announced pointwise multiple\nergodic convergence.\n\u0003\nWe have the following stronger convergence result for symmetric T .\n32\n\n\fTheorem 6.7 Let T be a map satisfying (0.I) - (0.IV). Assume further that T is positive as an\noperator on L2 (M). Let 1 < p < \u221e and x \u2208 Lp (M). Then (T n (x) \u2212 F (x))n belongs to Lp (M; c0 )\nand to Lp (M; cc0 ) if additionally p > 2. Consequently, T n (x) converges to F (x) b.a.u. for 1 < p \u2264 2\nand a.u. for 2 < p < \u221e.\nProof. Let us first treat the case p = 2. Write the spectral decomposition of T :\nZ 1\n\u03bb d e\u03bb .\nT =\n0\n\nNote that for any x \u2208 (I \u2212 T )(L2 (M))\nlim e\u03bb (x) = x in L2 (M).\n\n\u03bb\u21921\n\nGiven x \u2208 L2 (M) choose xk \u2208 (I \u2212 T )(L2 (M)) such that lim kx \u2212 F (x) \u2212 xk k2 = 0. Then\nlim\u03bb\u21921 e\u03bb (xk ) = xk . Thus replacing xk by e\u03bbk (xk ) with an appropriate \u03bbk \u2208 (0, 1), we can assume\nthat xk = e\u03bbk (yk ) for some yk \u2208 L2 (M). Then\nT n (xk ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03bbk\n\n\u03bbn d e\u03bb (yk ) ;\n\nwhence\n\n0\n\nkT n (xk )k2 \u2264 \u03bbnk kyk k2 .\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\nIt then follows that T n (xk ) n \u2208 L2 (M; c0 ) for every k, and so by Theorem 5.1, T n (x)\u2212 F (x) n \u2208\nL2 (M; c0 ).\nTo treat the general case we first claim that\nlim kT n (x) \u2212 F (x)kp = 0,\nn\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 Lp (M).\n\nIndeed, the preceding argument shows that this is true for p = 2. Now let 2 < p < \u221e and\nx \u2208 L1 (M) \u2229 M. By interpolation,\n2\n1\u2212 p\n\nkT n (x) \u2212 F (x)kp \u2264 kT n(x) \u2212 F (x)k\u221e\n\n2\n\nkT n (x) \u2212 F (x)k2p ;\n\nwhence limn kT n (x) \u2212 F (x)kp = 0. Then our claim in the case p > 2 follows from the density of\nL1 (M) \u2229 M in Lp (M). The case p < 2 is proved similarly.\nNow we can easily finish the proof of the theorem. Let x \u2208 Lp (M). Fix k \u2208 N. Then Theorem\n5.1 and the claim above imply\n\u0001\u0001\nlim\nT n T k (x) \u2212 F (x) n L (M;l ) = 0.\nk\u2192\u221e\n\np\n\n\u221e\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\nNote that T n T k (x) \u2212 F (x) = T n+k (x) \u2212 F (x), and so the sequence T n T k (x) \u2212 F (x) n\u22650 can\n\u0001\nbe considered as the rest of T n (x) \u2212 F (x) n\u22650 starting from the k-th coordinate. It follows that\n\u0001\nT n (x) \u2212 F (x) n\u22650 \u2208 Lp (M; c0 ).\n\u0001\nIn a similar way, using Corollary 5.9, we show that T n (x) \u2212 F (x) n \u2208 Lp (M; cc0 ) for any\nx \u2208 Lp (M) with p > 2.\n\u0003\nRemark. If we remove the additional assumption that T is a positive operator on L2 (M) in\nTheorem 6.7, then for any x \u2208 Lp (M) the two subsequences (T 2n (x))n and (T 2n+1 (x))n still\nconverge b.a.u.; however, their limits are not equal in general.\nWe end this section with the pointwise ergodic theorems for semigroups. Let (Tt )t\u22650 be a\nsemigroup satisfying (0.I) - (0.III). We denote again by F the projection from Lp (M) onto the\nfixed point subspace of (Tt )t\u22650 .\n\n33\n\n\fTheorem 6.8 Let (Tt )t\u22650 be a semigroup with (0.I) - (0.III). Let (Mt )t>0 denote the ergodic\naverages of (Tt )t\u22650 . Let 1 < p < \u221e and x \u2208 Lp (M).\ni) Then\na) Mt (x) converges to F (x) b.a.u. for 1 < p < 2 and a.u. for 2 \u2264 p < \u221e when t \u2192 \u221e.\nb) Mt (x) converges to x b.a.u. for 1 < p < 2 and a.u. for 2 \u2264 p < \u221e when t \u2192 0.\nii) Assume in addition that (Tt )t\u22650 satisfies (0.IV). Then\na) Tt (x) converges to F (x) b.a.u. for 1 < p \u2264 2 and a.u. for 2 < p < \u221e when t \u2192 \u221e.\nb) Tt (x) converges to x b.a.u. for 1 < p \u2264 2 and a.u. for 2 < p < \u221e when t \u2192 0.\nProof. The two statements a) can be proved similarly as in the discrete case, using Theorem 4.5.\nThe main step here is to obtain the\u0001 semigroup analogue of Theorem 6.3 as t \u2192 \u221e, namely, to\nshow that the family Mt (x) \u2212 F (x) t\u22651 belongs to Lp (M; c0 ([1, \u221e))) or Lp (M; cc0 ([1, \u221e))). Note\nhowever that the a.u. convergence for p = 2 in the first statement a) is shown similarly as Remark\n6.5, using now Remark 4.7. We leave this part of the proof to the reader, and will show the two\nstatements b). (The first of them is the noncommutative analogue of the classical Wienner local\npointwise ergodic theorem.)\n\u0001\nLet us first consider i), b). Let x \u2208 Lp (M). By Lemma 6.2, it suffices to prove Mt (x)\u2212x 0<t\u22641\nbelongs to Lp (M; c0 ((0, 1])) (with respect to t \u2192 0). By the mean ergodic theorem, we have\nMt (x) \u2192 x when t \u2192 0. Thus by a limit argument as in the proof of Theorem 6.3, we may assume\nx = Mt0 (y) for some 0 < t0 < 1 and y \u2208 Lp (M). On the other hand, by the density of L1 (M) \u2229 M\nin Lp (M), we can further assume that y \u2208 L1 (M) \u2229 M. Let 0 < s \u2264 t < t0 . Then\nTs (x) \u2212 x =\n\nZ s\nZ\ni\n1 h t0 +s\nTu (y)du \u2212\nTu (y)du .\nt0\n0\nt0\n\nIt then follows that\nkTs (x) \u2212 xk\u221e \u2264\nand so\nkMt (x) \u2212 xk\u221e \u2264\n\n2skyk\u221e\nt0\n\n2tkyk\u221e\n\u2192 0 as t \u2192 0.\nt0\n\nThus by the\u0001 interpolation argument used in the proof of Theorem 6.3, we deduce that the family\nMt (x) \u2212 x 0<t\u22641 belongs to Lp (M; c0 ((0, 1])). This proves the first part of the statement i), b).\nThe second part for p > 2 can be shown in the same way. The case p = 2 is dealt with similarly\nas Remark 6.5 in virtue of Remark 4.7.\nii), b) is proved similarly by using Corollary 5.11 and Lemma 6.2. Indeed, for x = Mt0 (y) as\nabove, we have already proved\nlim kTt (x) \u2212 xk\u221e = 0.\nt\u21920\n\u0001\nTherefore, Mt (x) \u2212 x 0<t\u22641 \u2208 Lp (M; c0 ((0, 1])). Thus the proof of the theorem is finished.\n\u0003\n\nRemarks. i) Both statements in Part i) of Theorem 6.8 also hold for p = 1 because of Remark\n4.7. On the other hand, both Theorem 6.7 and Theorem 6.8 admit multiple versions, similar to\nTheorem 6.6.\nii) Using Corollary 4.6, one sees that the ergodic averages Mt in Theorem 6.8, i) can be replaced\nby Pt , where (Pt ) is a semigroup subordinated to (Tt ). This is also true for p = 1.\n\n34\n\n\f7\n\nThe non tracial case\n\nSo far we have restricted our attention to the semifinite case only. In this section we will extend the\nprevious results to arbitrary von Neumann algebras. Despite the obvious similarity between the\nstatements in the semifinite and the non tracial cases, we want to point out that the situation for\ntype III von Neumann algebras is more complicated. This is due to the fact that for a state \u03c6 the\nequality \u03c6(e\u2228f ) \u2264 \u03c6(e)+\u03c6(f ) is no longer valid, and therefore many (Egorov type) arguments from\nthe previous section do not apply in this general setting. Our tool for maximal ergodic inequalities\nin Haagerup noncommutative Lp -spaces is an important unpublished theorem due to Haagerup,\nwhich consists in reducing the general case to the tracial one. For clarity, we divide this section\ninto several subsections.\n7.1 Haagerup noncommutative Lp -spaces\nThe general noncommutative Lp -spaces used below will be those constructed by Haagerup [H2].\nOur reference is [Te]. Throughout this section M will be a von Neumann algebra equipped with\na distinguished normal faithful state \u03c6, unless explicitly stated otherwise. Lp (M) denotes the\nassociated noncommutative Lp -space (0 < p \u2264 \u221e). Recall that L\u221e (M) is just M itself and\nL1 (M) is the predual of M. The duality between M and L1 (M) is realized via the distinguished\ntracial functional tr on L1 (M):\nhx, yi = tr(xy),\n\ny \u2208 L1 (M), x \u2208 M.\n\nAs a normal positive functional on M, \u03c6 corresponds to a positive element in L1 (M). In the\nsequel this element will be always denoted by D, called the density of \u03c6 in L1 (M). Then \u03c6 can\nbe recovered from D through the preceding duality:\n\u03c6(x) = tr(xD) = tr(Dx),\n1\u2212\u03b8\n\nx \u2208 M.\n\n\u03b8\n\nWe will often use the density of D p MD p in Lp (M) for any p \u2208 (0, \u221e) and 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 1. Moreover,\n1\u2212\u03b8\n\u03b8\nD p Ma D p is also dense in Lp (M), where Ma is the family of all elements in M analytic with\nrespect to the modular group \u03c3t\u03c6 of \u03c6 (see [JX2, Lemma 1.1]).\nAn important link between the spaces Lp (M) is the following external product. Let 1r = p1 + q1\nand x \u2208 Lp (M), y \u2208 Lq (M). Then xy \u2208 Lr (M) and\nkxykr \u2264 kxkp kykq .\nNamely, the usual H\u00f6lder inequality extends to Haagerup Lp -spaces too. In particular, the dual\nspace of Lp (M) is Lp\u2032 (M) for 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, and we have\ntr(xy) = tr(yx),\n\nx \u2208 Lp (M), y \u2208 Lp\u2032 (M).\n\nThe definition of all vector-valued Lp -spaces extends verbatim to the present setting. These\ninclude Lp (M; l\u221e ), Lp (M; lc\u221e ), Lp (M; c0 ) and Lp (M; cc0 ). For instance, Lp (M; l\u221e ) consists of\nall sequences x = (xn ) in Lp (M) which admit a factorization of the following type: there are\na, b \u2208 L2p (M) and a bounded sequence (yn ) \u2282 M such that xn = ayn b for all n. The norm of x is\nthen defined as\n\b\nkxkLp (M;l\u221e ) = inf kak2p sup kyn k\u221e kbk2p ,\nn\n\nwhere the infimum runs over all factorizations as above. We adopt the convention introduced in\nsection 2 and denote again this norm by supn + xn p . Note that Lp (M; c0 ) (resp. Lp (M; cc0 )) is\nagain a closed subspace of Lp (M; l\u221e ) (resp. Lp (M; lc\u221e )). Similarly, given an index set I we define\nthe analogues of these spaces for families indexed by I.\n\n35\n\n\fAll properties in section 2 continue to hold in the present setting. However, for an inclusion\nLp (N ) \u2282 Lp (M) we will now require the existence of a normal state preserving conditional expectation from M onto N . Under this hypothesis Remark 2.3 still holds. Also note that for the\ninterpolation result in Proposition 2.5 we use Kosaki interpolation theorem [Ko].\n7.2 An extension result\nLet T be a map on M. We will assume that T satisfies conditions similar to (0.I) - (0.IV). More\nprecisely, we will consider the following properties of T :\n(7.I) T is a contraction on M.\n(7.II) T is completely positive.\n(7.III) \u03c6 \u25e6 T \u2264 \u03c6.\n\n(7.IV) T \u25e6 \u03c3t\u03c6 = \u03c3t\u03c6 \u25e6 T for all t \u2208 R\n(7.V) T is symmetric with respect to \u03c6, i.e. \u03c6(T (y)\u2217 x) = \u03c6(y \u2217 T (x)) for all x, y \u2208 M.\nIn order to consider maximal ergodic inequalities in Lp (M), we need first to extend a map T\nwith the properties above to a contraction on Lp (M) for all 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. The following is the non\ntracial analogue of Lemma 1.1.\nLemma 7.1 Let T be a map on M satisfying (7.I) - (7.III). Define\n1\n\n1\n\nTp : D 2p M D 2p\n\n\u2192\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nD 2p M D 2p\n1\n\n1\n\n7\u2192 D 2p T (x) D 2p .\n\nD 2p x D 2p\n\nThen Tp extends to a positive contraction on Lp (M) for all 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. Moreover, T is normal.\nIf additionally T verifies (7.V), then the extension of T2 is selfadjoint on L2 (M).\nIn fact, the complete positivity assumption can be weakened to positivity. This result comes\nfrom [JX5]. Its proof is much more involved than that of Lemma 1.1. The main difficulty is to\nshow the extension property of T1 . This extension is essentially a reformulation of Lemma 1.2 from\n[H1] into the present setting. We refer to [JX5] for more details. The following observation is easily\nchecked:\nRemark. Let T and Tp be as in Lemma 7.1 (Tp also denoting the extension). Let S = T1\u2217 . Then\nS satisfies (7.I) - (7.III) too. Moreover, Sp\u2217 = Tp\u2032 for all 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, where Sp is the extension of S\non Lp (M), guaranteed by Lemma 7.1. This shows, in particular, that T is normal.\nThe extension in Lemma 7.1 is symmetric with respect to the injection of M into Lp (M).\nWe could also consider the left extension: xD1/p 7\u2192 T (x)D1/p (x \u2208 M). More generally, for any\n0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 1 we can define\nTp,\u03b8 : D\n\n1\u2212\u03b8\np\n\nD\n\n\u03b8\n\n1\u2212\u03b8\np\n\nMDp\n\n\u2192\n\nxDp\n\n7\u2192 D\n\n\u03b8\n\nD\n\n1\u2212\u03b8\np\n\n1\u2212\u03b8\np\n\n\u03b8\n\nMDp\n\n\u03b8\n\nT (x) D p .\n\nNote that Tp,1/2 is exactly the Tp defined in Lemma 7.1. Assume in addition that T satisfies (7.IV).\nUsing the equality\n1\u2212\u03b8\n\u03b8\n1\nD p Ma D p = Ma D p ,\none easily checks that\n\nTp,\u03b8\n\n1\n\nMa D p\n\n= Tp\n\n1\n\nMa D p\n\n.\n\nThus Tp,\u03b8 does not depend on \u03b8 (at least when restricted to analytic elements). Consequently,\nTp,\u03b8 extends to a contraction on Lp (M). Since we will use this observation later, we formulate it\nexplicitly.\n36\n\n\fRemark 7.2 Let T satisfy (7.I) - (7.IV). Then Tp,\u03b8 does not depend on \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 1] and extends to\na positive contraction on Lp (M).\nConvention. In the sequel, we will denote, by the same symbol T , all the maps Tp and Tp,\u03b8 as\nwell as their extensions to the Lp -spaces in Lemma 7.1 and Remark 7.2, whenever no confusion\ncan occur.\nLet T be a map on M with (7.I) - (7.III). We will consider again the ergodic averages:\nMn \u2261 Mn (T ) =\n\nn\n1 X k\nT .\nn+1\nk=0\n\nAll discussions in section 1 concerning the mean ergodic theorem are still valid now. Thus T is\nergodic on Lp (M) for all 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e (relative to the w*-topology for p = \u221e). We still have the\ndecomposition\nLp (M) = Fp (T ) \u2295 Fp (T )\u22a5 ,\n\nwith Fp (T ) = {x \u2208 Lp (M) : T (x) = x}. In the previous sections, we used several times the fact\nthat (I \u2212 T )(L1 (M) \u2229 M) is dense in Fp (T )\u22a5 . Now this fact should be changed to the following:\n1\n1\nD 2p (I \u2212 T )(M) D 2p is dense in Fp (T )\u22a5 . If T further satisfies (7.IV), this dense subspace can be\n1\u2212\u03b8\n\u03b8\n1\nreplaced by D p (I \u2212 T )(Ma ) D p for any \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 1], which is equal to (I \u2212 T )(Ma ) D p too. The\neasy verification of these facts is left to the reader. As before in the tracial case, the projection\nfrom Lp (M) onto Fp (T ) will be denoted by F for any 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e. Again F is normal as a map on\nL\u221e (M).\n\nThe discussion above is readily transferred to semigroups. Let (Tt ) be a semigroup of maps on\nM satisfying (7.I) - (7.III) (i.e. each Tt satisfying (7.I) - (7.III)). Then (Tt ) extends to a semigroup\nof positive contractions on Lp (M) for 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. We will assume that (Tt ) is w*-continuous\nand T0 is the identity. Then (Tt ) is strongly continuous on Lp (M) for every p < \u221e. Again the\nfixed point projection of (Tt ) is denoted by F . Then the mean ergodic theorem asserts that Mt (x)\nconverges to F (x) as t \u2192 \u221e for all x \u2208 Lp (M) (relative to the w*-topology for p = \u221e), where Mt\ndenotes the ergodic averages of (Tt ).\nThe following extends a well-known result in the commutative case to the present situation.\nRemark 7.3 Let T be a map on M verifying (7.I) - (7.III). Assume in addition that \u03c6 \u25e6 T = \u03c6.\nThen F\u221e (T ) is a von Neumann subalgebra of M and F is the normal conditional expectation from\nM onto F\u221e (T ) such that \u03c6 \u25e6 F = \u03c6.\nProof. First note that under the assumptions above, both T and F are unital and F preserves\nthe state \u03c6. Thus F is a normal unital completely positive projection from M onto F\u221e (T ).\nConsequently, F\u221e (T ) contains the unit of M and is closed under involution, and so F\u221e (T ) is a\nw*-closed operator system. Therefore, it remains to show that F\u221e (T ) is closed under the product\nof M.\nTo that end we will use the following formula from [ChE] (formula (3.1) there),\n(7.1)\n\nF (aF (x)) = F (ax)\n\nand F (F (x)a) = F (xa),\n\n\u2200 a \u2208 F\u221e (T ), x \u2208 M.\n\nLet us consider the preadjoint of F , F\u2217 : M\u2217 \u2192 M\u2217 . We claim that\nF\u2217 (x\u03c6) = F (x)\u03c6,\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 M.\n\nIndeed, since \u03c6 \u25e6 F = \u03c6, given y \u2208 M, by (7.1) we have\nF\u2217 (x\u03c6)(y)\n\n=\n\nx\u03c6(F (y)) = \u03c6(F (y)x) = \u03c6[F (F (y)x)] = \u03c6[F (F (y)F (x))]\n\n=\n\n\u03c6[F (yF (x))] = \u03c6(yF (x)) = [F (x)\u03c6](y).\n37\n\n\fNow let a, b \u2208 F\u221e (T ). Then F\u2217 (ab\u03c6) = F (ab)\u03c6. On the other hand, for any x \u2208 M\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003\nF\u2217 (ab\u03c6)(x) = \u03c6(F (x)ab) = \u03c6[F (F (x)ab)] = \u03c6 F F [F (x)a]b\n= \u03c6[F (F (xa)b)] = \u03c6[F (xab)] = \u03c6(xab) = [ab\u03c6](x).\n\nHence, F\u2217 (ab\u03c6) = ab\u03c6. It thus follows that F (ab)\u03c6 = ab\u03c6. Then the faithfulness of \u03c6 implies that\nF (ab) = ab, and so F\u221e (T ) is stable under multiplication, as desired.\n\u0003\n7.3 Maximal ergodic inequalities\nThe following is the extension of Theorems 4.1 and 5.1 to the non tracial case.\nTheorem 7.4 i) Let T satisfy (7.I) - (7.IV). Let (Mn ) denote the ergodic averages of T . Then for\nany 1 < p < \u221e\nsup+ Mn (x) p \u2264 Cp kxkp , x \u2208 Lp (M).\nn\n\nii) If T further satisfies (7.V), then\nsup+ T n (x)\nn\n\np\n\n\u2264 Cp\u2032 kxkp ,\n\nx \u2208 Lp (M).\n\nHere Cp and Cp\u2032 are respectively the constants in (4.1) and (5.1).\nRemark. Compared with Theorems 4.1 and 5.1 in the tracial case, the assumption in Theorem\n7.4 is a little bit stronger, namely, the positivity of T in those theorems is now reinforced to the\ncomplete positivity (7.II). It is likely that this is not really needed.\nAs in the tracial case, Theorem 7.4 immediately yields the following two corollaries.\nCorollary 7.5 Let T satisfy (7.I) - (7.IV) and 2 < p < \u221e. Then\nq\n\u0001\nMn (x) n\u22650 Lp (M;lc ) \u2264 Cp/2 kxkp , \u2200 x \u2208 Lp (M).\n\u221e\n\nIf additionally T has (7.V), then\n\n\u0001\nT n (x) n\u22650\n\nLp (M;lc\u221e )\n\n\u2264\n\nq\nC \u2032 p/2 kxkp ,\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 Lp (M).\n\nCorollary 7.6 Let (Tt ) be a w*-continuous semigroup of maps on M satisfying (7.I) - (7.IV). Let\nZ\n1 t\nTs ds, t > 0.\nMt =\nt 0\nThen for any 1 < p < \u221e\nsup+ Mt (x)\nt\n\nand for p > 2\n\n\u0001\nMt (x) t>0\n\np\n\n\u2264 Cp kxkp ,\n\nLp (M;lc\u221e (R+ ))\n\n\u2264\n\nIf additionally each Tt satisfies (7.V), then\nsup+ Tt (x)\nt\n\nand for p > 2\n\n\u0001\nTt (x) t>0\n\np\n\nq\nCp/2 kxkp ,\n\n\u2264 Cp\u2032 kxkp ,\n\nLp (M;lc\u221e (R+ ))\n\n\u2264\n\nx \u2208 Lp (M)\n\nx \u2208 Lp (M)\n\nq\nC \u2032 p/2 kxkp ,\n38\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 Lp (M).\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 Lp (M).\n\n\fAlthough they are not stated here, all other inequalities in sections 4 and 5 continue to hold for\nHaagerup noncommutative Lp -spaces. We omit the details. The rest of this subsection is devoted\nto the proof of Theorem 7.4. It relies in a crucial way on Haagerup's reduction theorem [H3]. We\nwill need the precise form of Haagerup's construction that we recall very briefly below.\nS\nLet G denote the discrete subgroup m\u22651 2\u2212m Z of R. We consider the crossed product\nR = M \u22ca\u03c3\u03c6 G. Here the modular automorphism group \u03c3 \u03c6 is also regarded as an automorphic representation of G on M. As usual, M is viewed as a von Neumann subalgebra of R. Let \u03c6\nb\ndenote the dual weight of \u03c6. Since G is discrete, \u03c6\nb is a normal faithful state on R and its restriction\nto M coincides with \u03c6. Moreover, there is a normal faithful conditional expectation \u03a6 from R\nonto M such that\n\u03c6\nb\u25e6\u03a6 = \u03c6\nb and \u03c3t\u03c6b \u25e6 \u03a6 = \u03a6 \u25e6 \u03c3t\u03c6b , t \u2208 R.\nThen Haagerup's reduction theorem can be stated as follows.\n\nTheorem 7.7 (Haagerup) With the notations above, there is an increasing sequence (Rm )m\u22651\nof von Neumann subalgebras of R satisfying the following properties\ni) each Rm is equipped with a normal faithful tracial state \u03c4m ;\nS\nii) m\u22651 Rm is w*-dense in R;\n\niii) there is a normal faithful conditional expectation \u03a6m from R onto Rm such that\n\u03c6\nb \u25e6 \u03a6m = \u03c6\nb and\n\n\u03c3t\u03c6b \u25e6 \u03a6m = \u03a6m \u25e6 \u03c3t\u03c6b ,\n\nt \u2208 R.\n\nWe refer to [H3] for the proof. [JX5] reproduces Haagerup's proof and presents several applications of Theorem 7.7.\nIn the situation above, Lp (M) and Lp (Rm ) can be regarded naturally and isometrically as\nsubspaces of Lp (R). Moreover, the conditional expectation \u03a6 (resp. \u03a6m ) extends to a positive\ncontractive projection from Lp (R) onto Lp (M)\nS (resp. Lp (Rm )) (see [JX2]; this is also a particular\ncase of Lemma 7.1). On the other hand, m\u22651 Lp (Rm ) is dense in Lp (R) for p < \u221e and the\nsequence (\u03a6m ) is increasing. Thus (Rm ) gives rise to a martingale structure on R, and consequently,\ngiven x \u2208 Lp (R) with 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, \u03a6m (x) converges to x in Lp (R) as m \u2192 \u221e.\nLet us also observe that by Remark 2.3 applied to Haagerup spaces, Lp (M; l\u221e ) and Lp (Rm ; l\u221e )\nare isometrically subspaces of Lp (R; l\u221e ).\nFor the proof of Theorem 7.4 we will further need the following result from [JX5].\nLemma 7.8 Let T be as in Theorem 7.4.\ni) Then T has an extension Tb to R which satisfies (7.I) - (7.IV) relative to (R, \u03c6).\nb Moreover, if\nT verifies (7.V), so does Tb relative to \u03c6.\nb\n\nii) Tb(Rm ) \u2282 Rm and \u03c4m \u25e6 Tb \u2264 \u03c4m for all m \u2265 1.\n\nNow we are ready to show Theorem 7.4.\nProof of Theorem 7.4. Fix 1 < p < \u221e and x \u2208 Lp (M). We consider x as an element in Lp (R) and\ndef\nthen apply the conditional expectation \u03a6m to it: xm = \u03a6m (x) \u2208 Lp (Rm ). Note that Tb Rm satisfies\nthe conditions (0.I) - (0.III) relative to \u03c4m . So we can apply Theorem 4.1 to Tb on Rm and get\nsup+ Mn (Tb)(xm )\nn\n\np\n\n\u2264 Cp kxkp ,\n\nBy the martingale convergence theorem recalled previously,\nlim xm = x\n\nm\u2192\u221e\n\n39\n\nin Lp (R).\n\n\u2200 m \u2208 N.\n\n\fConsequently,\n\nlim Tb k (xm ) = x\n\nin Lp (R),\n\nm\u2192\u221e\n\n\u2200 k \u2265 0.\n\n\u0001\nOn the other hand, it is clear that the norm of Lp (R; ln\u221e ) is equivalent to that of ln\u221e Lp (R) for\neach fixed n. We then deduce that\nlim\n\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nHowever, since x \u2208 Lp (M),\n\nsup+ Mk (Tb)(xm )\n\n1\u2264k\u2264n\n\np\n\n=\n\nsup+ |Mk (Tb)(x)|\n\n1\u2264k\u2264n\n\nMk (Tb)(x) = Mk (T )(x).\n\nTherefore, we deduce\n\nsup+ Mk (T )(x)\n\n1\u2264k\u2264n\n\np\n\n\u2264 Cp kxkp ,\n\np\n\n.\n\n\u2200 n \u2208 N.\n\nThus, by Proposition 2.1 and Remark 2.3, we have\nsup+ Mn (T )(x)\nn\n\np\n\n\u2264 Cp kxkp .\n\nThis shows the first part of Theorem 7.4. The second part is proved similarly.\n\n\u0003\n\n7.4 Individual ergodic theorems\nIn this subsection we consider individual ergodic theorems in Haagerup's noncommutative Lp spaces. As mentioned earlier, the situation is more complicated than that in the tracial case.\nOne of the reasons is that the elements in Lp (M) are no longer closed densely defined operators\naffiliated with M but affiliated with a larger von Neumann algebra, namely the crossed product\nM\u22ca\u03c3\u03c6 R. We first need to introduce an appropriate analogue of the almost everywhere convergence\nfor sequences in Lp (M). There are several such generalizations. Here we adopt the almost sure\nconvergence introduced by Jajte [Ja2] (following ideas from [DJ2]). In the L\u221e -case, we continue\nto use Lance's almost uniform convergence.\nDefinition 7.9 i) Let xn , x \u2208 M. xn is said to converge almost uniformly (a.u. in short) to x if\nfor every \u03b5 > 0 there is a projection e \u2208 M such that\n\u03c6(e\u22a5 ) < \u03b5\n\nand\n\nlim k(xn \u2212 x)ek\u221e = 0.\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nii) Let xn , x \u2208 Lp (M) with p < \u221e. The sequence (xn ) is said to converge almost surely (a.s. in\nshort) to x if for every \u03b5 > 0 there is a projection e \u2208 M and a family (an,k ) \u2282 M such that\nX\nX\n1\nlim\n(an,k e) \u221e = 0,\n\u03c6(e\u22a5 ) < \u03b5 and xn \u2212 x =\nan,k D p ,\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nk\u22651\n\nk\u22651\n\nwhere the two series converge in norm in Lp (M) and M, respectively.\niii) Similarly, we define bilateral almost uniform (b.a.u.) convergence and bilateral almost sure\n(b.a.s.) convergence. Note that for the latter we use the symmetric injection of M into Lp (M) :\n1\n1\na 7\u2192 D 2p a D 2p .\nThe following non tracial analogue of Lemma 6.2 is obtained in [DJ2]. For the sake of completeness we provide a simplified proof.\nLemma 7.10 i) If (xn ) \u2208 Lp (M; c0 ) with 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, then xn converges b.a.s. to 0.\nii) If 2 \u2264 p < \u221e and (xn ) \u2208 Lp (M; cc0 ), then xn converges a.s. to 0.\n\n40\n\n\fProof. Suppose (xn ) \u2208 Lp (M; c0 ). Then there are a, b \u2208 L2p (M) and yn \u2208 M such that\nand kak2p < 1, kbk2p < 1, lim kyn k\u221e = 0.\n\nxn = ayn b\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n1\n\nBy the density of D 2p M in L2p (M), there are ak \u2208 M such that\nX 1\n1\na=\nD 2p ak and\nD 2p ak 2p < 2\u2212k .\nk\u22651\n\nSimilarly,\nb=\n\nX\n\n1\n\nand\n\nbk D 2p\n\n1\n\nbk D 2p\n\n2p\n\n< 2\u2212k .\n\nk\u22651\n\nThus\nxn =\n\nX\n\n1\n\n1\n\nD 2p aj yn bk D 2p ,\n\nconvergence in Lp (M).\n\nj,k\n\nBy the H\u00f6lder inequality,\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\u03c6(ak a\u2217k ) = D 2 ak a\u2217k D 2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\u2264 D 2p ak a\u2217k D 2p\n\np\n\n< 2\u22122k .\n\nIn the same way, \u03c6(b\u2217k bk ) < 2\u22122k . Now let \u03b5 > 0. Then by [Ja1, Corollary 2.2.13], there is a\nprojection e \u2208 M such that\n\b\n\u03c6(e\u22a5 ) < \u03b5 and max keak a\u2217k ek\u221e , keb\u2217k bk ek\u221e \u2264 8 \u03b5\u22121 2\u2212k , \u2200 k \u2265 1.\n\nTherefore,\n\nX\n\nj,k\u22651\n\nwhence the double series\n\nP\n\nkeaj yn bk ek\u221e \u2264 8 \u03b5\u22121 kyn k\u221e\n\nj,k (eaj yn bk e)\n\n\u0002X\n\n2\u2212k/2\n\nk\n\n\u00032\n\n;\n\nconverges absolutely in M and\n\nlim\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nX\n\neaj yn bk e = 0.\n\nj,k\n\nHence xn \u2192 0 b.a.s.. The second part is proved similarly.\n\n\u0003\n\n\u0001\nTheorem 7.11 i) Let T be a map on M satisfying (7.I) - (7.IV). Then Mn (x) \u2212 F (x) n \u2208\nLp (M; c0 ) for 1 < p < \u221e and x \u2208 Lp (M). More generally, let T1 , ..., Td be d such maps and let\nMn1 , ..., nd = Mnd (Td ) * * * Mn1 (T1 ) .\nLet Fk be the projection on the fixed point subspace of Tk . Then\n\u0001\nMn1 , ..., nd (x) \u2212 Fd * * * F1 (x) n , ..., n \u22651 \u2208 Lp (M; c0 (Nd )),\n1\n\nd\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 Lp (M), 1 < p < \u221e\n\nand\n\n\u0001\nMn1 , ..., nd (x) \u2212 Fd * * * F1 (x) n1 , ..., n\n\nd \u22651\n\n\u2208 Lp (M; cc0 (Nd )),\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 Lp (M), 2 < p < \u221e.\n\nii) If the Tk further verify (7.V) and are positive operators on L2 (M), then in the statement\nabove the iterated ergodic averages Mn1 , ..., nd can be replaced by the iterated powers Tdnd * * * T1n1 .\n\n41\n\n\fProof. i) Let 1 < p < \u221e and x \u2208 L\n\u0001 p (M). By the discussion following Remark 7.2, we can find\nyk \u2208 M and xk = D1/2p yk \u2212 T (yk ) D1/2p such that\nlim kx \u2212 F (x) \u2212 xk kp = 0 .\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nWe have\nMn (xk ) =\n\n\u0003 1\n1 \u0002\n1\nD 2p yk \u2212 T n+1 (yk ) D 2p\nn+1\n\n\u0001\nand so Mn (xk ) n \u2208 Lp (M; c0 ). Then as in the proof of Theorem 6.3, we deduce that Mn (x) \u2212\n\u0001\nF (x) n \u2208 Lp (M; c0 ).\nNow assume 2 < p < \u221e. Then by Remark 7.2, the xk above can be defined by\n1\n\nwith yk \u2208 Ma .\n\u0001\n\u0001\nThen Mn (xk ) n \u2208 Lp (M; cc0 ), and so Mn (x) \u2212 F (x) n \u2208 Lp (M; cc0 ).\nIterating the arguments above as in the proof of Theorem 6.6 and using the Haagerup space\nanalogue of Corollary 4.4, we obtain the result for the multiple ergodic averages.\nxk = (yk \u2212 T (yk ))D p\n\nii) In the case of one contraction, this part is proved in the same way as Theorem 6.7. The\ngeneral case is dealt with by iteration. We omit the details.\n\u0003\nCorollary 7.12 With the assumption and notations in Theorem 7.11 i), for any 1 < p < \u221e and\nx \u2208 Lp (M)\nlim\nMn1 , ..., nd (x) = Fd * * * F1 (x) b.a.s.;\nn1 \u2192\u221e, ..., nd \u2192\u221e\n\nif p > 2, the convergence above is a.s.. With the same assumption as in Theorem 7.11 ii), we have\nlim\n\nn1 \u2192\u221e, ..., nd \u2192\u221e\n\nTdnd * * * T1n1 (x) = Fd * * * F1 (x)\n\nb.a.s.\n\nfor x \u2208 Lp (M) and 1 < p < \u221e. Again the convergence is a.s. for p > 2.\nRemarks. i) Combining the preceding arguments with those in the tracial case in section 6, we\neasily show that Theorem 6.8 continues to hold in the present setting of Haagerup Lp -spaces with\na.s. convergence in place of a.u. convergence, as in Corollary 7.12 above.\nii) Using Goldstein's maximal weak type (1, 1) inequality ([Go]; see also [Ja2, Theorem 2.2.12]),\nwe can show that the first part of Corollary 7.12 remains true for p = 1 and d = 1 (i.e. for only\none contraction).\niii) Jajte [Ja2] states a multiple individual ergodic theorem in L2 (M) (Theorem 2.3.4 there),\nwhich corresponds to the first part of Corollary 7.12 in the case of p = 2. His proof uses in an\nessential way his previous Theorem 2.2.4. Based upon an iteration using Goldstein's maximal weak\ntype (1, 1) inequality, the proof of the latter theorem seems, however, to present a serious gap.\nCorollary 7.12 excludes the case p = \u221e, so does not allow to recover all previous results by\nLance [L], K\u00fcmmerer [K\u00fc], etc. This situation can be easily remedied. This is done by virtue of\nthe following simple lemma (see also [DJ2]):\nLemma 7.13 Let 1 \u2264 p < \u221e and xn \u2208 M. Then\n1\n\n1\n\n(D 2p xn D 2p )n \u2208 Lp (M; c0 ) =\u21d2 xn \u2192 0 b.a.u.\n1\n\n(xn D 2p )n \u2208 Lp (M; cc0 ) =\u21d2 xn \u2192 0 a.u.\n\n42\n\n\f1\n\n1\n\nProof. Assume (D 2p xn D 2p )n \u2208 Lp (M; c0 ). Choose a, b, yn , ak and bk exactly as in the proof of\n1\n1\nLemma 7.10 (with D 2p xn D 2p = ayn b). Next for each n choose an integer kn such that\n1\n\nkn\nX\n\n1\n\nD 2p xn D 2p \u2212\n\nkn\nX\n\nzn = xn \u2212\n1\n\n< 4\u2212n .\n\naj y n b k .\n\nj,k=1\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nD 2 zn D 2\n\np\n\nj,k=1\n\nSet\n\nThen\n\n1\n\n1\n\nD 2p aj yn bk D 2p\n\n1\n\n\u2264 D 2p zn D 2p\n\np\n\n< 4\u2212n .\n\nLet un and vn be respectively the real and imaginary part of zn . Then the inequality above holds\nwith un and vn instead of zn . Now we apply [H1, Lemma 1.2] already quoted previously and\nreformulated in our setting as in [JX5]. We then find u\u2032n , u\u2032\u2032n \u2208 M+ such that un = u\u2032n \u2212 u\u2032\u2032n and\n1\n\n1\n\nD 2 un D 2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n= D 2 u\u2032n D 2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n+ D 2 u\u2032\u2032n D 2\n\n1\n\n= \u03c6(u\u2032n ) + \u03c6(u\u2032\u2032n ).\n\nSimilarly, we have vn\u2032 and vn\u2032\u2032 for vn . Thus\n\u03c6(u\u2032n ) + \u03c6(u\u2032\u2032n ) < 4\u2212n ,\n\n\u03c6(vn\u2032 ) + \u03c6(vn\u2032\u2032 ) < 4\u2212n .\n\nNow given \u03b5 > 0, applying [Ja1, Corollary 2.2.13] to the family\n\b\nan a\u2217n , b\u2217n bn , u\u2032n , u\u2032\u2032n , vn\u2032 , vn\u2032\u2032 : n \u2208 N ,\n\nwe get a projection e \u2208 M such that \u03c6(e\u22a5 ) < \u03b5 and\n\b\nmax kean a\u2217n ek\u221e , keb\u2217n bn ek\u221e , keu\u2032n ek\u221e , keu\u2032\u2032n ek\u221e , kevn\u2032 ek\u221e , kevn\u2032\u2032 ek\u221e < 16 \u03b5\u22121 2\u2212n\n\nfor all n \u2208 N.

The proof of the second part on the a.u. convergence is similar and even\neasier (without appealing to Haagerup's Lemma). Thus we omit the details.\n\u0003\nThe first part of the following is well-known (cf., e.g. [Ja1]).\nCorollary 7.14 let T1 , ..., Td satisfy (7.I) - (7.IV) and let\nMn1 , ..., nd = Mnd (Td ) * * * Mn1 (T1 ) .\nThen for any x \u2208 M\nlim\n\nn1 \u2192\u221e, ..., nd \u2192\u221e\n\nMn1 , ..., nd (x) = Fd * * * F1 (x)\n\na.u.\n\nIf T1 , ..., Td additionally have (7.V), then\nlim\n\nn1 \u2192\u221e, ..., nd \u2192\u221e\n\nTdnd * * * T1n1 (x) = Fd * * * F1 (x)\n43\n\na.u.\n\n\fProof. This immediately follows from Theorem 7.11 and Lemma 7.13.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark. In the case of d = 1, the first part of Corollary 7.14 permits to recover Lance's theorem.\nHowever, compared with K\u00fcmmerer's theorem, our hypothesis is stronger for K\u00fcmmerer assumed\nonly that T is a positive contraction verifying (7.III). We do not know whether all ergodic theorems\nin this section hold for such contractions or not. In particular, is Theorem 7.4 true for a positive\ncontraction T satisfying (7.III) (and (7.V))?\nRemark. As in the tracial case, all the preceding individual ergodic theorems admit semigroup\nanalogues.\n\n8\n\nExamples\n\nWe will give some natural examples to which the results in the previous sections can be applied.\n8.1 Modular groups\nThe very first examples are modular automorphism groups. Let \u03c6 be a normal faithful state on a\nvon Neumann algebra M. Let \u03c3t\u03c6 be the modular group of \u03c6. Then Tt = \u03c3t\u03c6 satisfies the properties\n\u03c6\n(7.I) - (7.IV). On the other hand, (7.V) is equivalent to \u03c6(\u03c3t\u03c6 (y)x) = \u03c6(y\u03c3\u2212t\n(x)) for all x, y \u2208 M\nand t \u2208 R. Thus applying Corollary 7.6, we get that for 1 < p < \u221e\nZ\n1 t \u03c6\nsup+\n\u03c3 (x)ds p \u2264 Cp kxkp , \u2200 x \u2208 Lp (M).\nt 0 s\nt\nNote that the fixed point subspace F\u221e of (\u03c3t\u03c6 ) coincides with the centralizer M\u03c6 of \u03c6. Consequently, Fp coincides with Lp (M\u03c6 ), considered as a subspace of Lp (M). Thus applying the results\nZ\n1 t \u03c6\n\u03c3 (x)ds converge b.a.u. to x (resp.\nin subsection 7.4, we deduce that the ergodic averages\nt 0 s\nF (x)) as t \u2192 0 (resp. t \u2192 \u221e) for all x \u2208 Lp (M) and 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e. Moreover, the convergence is\na.u. in the case of p \u2265 2. Let us consider a state \u03c6(x) = \u03bbx11 + \u03bcx22 on the matrix algebra M2 of\n2 \u00d7 2 matrices, where 0 < \u03bb 6= \u03bc < 1. Then we see that \u03c3t\u03c6 (e12 ) = eit(\u03bb\u2212\u03bc) e12 is not convergent for\nt \u2192 \u221e. At least in this case it is obvious that the symmetry condition (7.V) is really necessary.\n8.2 Semi-noncommutative case\nLet (\u03a9, F , \u03bc) be a \u03c3-finite measure space. Let N be a von Neumann algebra equipped with a\n \u0304 , \u03bd) be the von Neumann algebra\nsemifinite normal faithful trace \u03bd. Let (M, \u03c4 ) = (L\u221e (\u03a9), \u03bc)\u2297(N\ntensor product. (Note that we consider \u03bc as a trace on Lp (\u03a9) via integration.) Given p < \u221e\nthe corresponding noncommutative Lp (M) is just Lp (\u03a9; Lp (N )), the usual Lp -space of strongly\nmeasurable p-integrable functions on \u03a9 with values in Lp (N ). Now let (St ) be a semigroup on Lp (\u03a9)\nsatisfying the conditions (0.I) - (0.III) (with M = L\u221e (\u03a9) there). Then Tt = I \u2297 St is a semigroup\non Lp (M) verifying the same conditions. Moreover, if St is symmetric, so is Tt . Thus we can\ntransfer all classical semigroups to this semi-noncommutative setting and obtain the corresponding\nergodic theorems. In particular, applying this procedure to the usual Poisson semigroup (Pt ) on\nthe unit circle T or on Rn , by Corollary 4.6, we get\nsup+ I \u2297 Pt (x)\nt\n\np\n\n\u2264 Cp kxkp ,\n\nx \u2208 Lp (Rn ; Lp (N )), 1 < p < \u221e.\n\nFor p = 1 we also have a weak type inequality (see Remark 4.7). These results were also proved by\nMei [M] using a different method. Moreover, he obtained the non-tangential analogue (for the upper\nhalf plane) of the inequality above. Note that in this discussion, the usual Poisson semigroup on\nRn can be replaced by the Poisson semigroup subordinated to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup\non Rn .\n44\n\n\fThe situation above readily extends to the non tracial case. Assume that \u03bc is a probability\nmeasure and N a von Neumann algebra equipped with a normal faithful state \u03c8. Then the tensor\nproduct M is equipped with the tensor state \u03c6 = \u03bc \u2297 \u03c8. This allows to apply the ergodic results\nin section 7 to this semi-noncommutative setting.\n8.3 Schur multipliers\nLet M = B(l2 ). Then the associated noncommutative Lp -spaces are the Schatten classes Sp . The\nelements in Sp are represented as infinite matrices. Let \u03c6 be a function on N \u00d7 N. Recall that \u03c6 is\na Schur multiplier on Sp if the map M\u03c6 : x 7\u2192 (\u03c6jk xjk ), defined for finite matrices x, extends to a\nbounded map on Sp (which is still denoted by M\u03c6 ).\nLet us consider a function f : N \u2192 H, where H is a real Hilbert space, and the associated\nkernel\nK(j, k) = kf (j) \u2212 f (k)k, j, k \u2208 N.\nWe are interested in the semigroups (Tt ) and (Pt ) of Schur multipliers, which are determined by\n2\n\nTt (ejk ) = e\u2212tK(j,k) ejk\n\nand Pt (ejk ) = e\u2212tK(j,k) ejk ,\n\nwhere the ejk 's stand for the canonical matrix units of B(l2 ). It is well-known that these are\ncompletely positive contractive semigroups on B(l2 ). Indeed, let \u03bc be a Gaussian measure on H,\ni.e. a probability space (\u03a9, \u03bc) together with a measurable function w : \u03a9 \u2192 H such that\nZ\n\u0001\n\u0001\nexp ihh, w(\u03c9)i d\u03bc(\u03c9) , h \u2208 H.\nexp \u2212 khk2 =\n\u03a9\n\n\u221a\n\u0001\nGiven \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9, t > 0 let Dt (\u03c9) be the diagonal matrix with diagonal entries exp i t hf (j), w(\u03c9)i ,\nj \u2208 N. Then it is easy to see that\nZ\nDt (\u03c9)xDt (\u03c9)\u2217 d\u03bc(\u03c9) , x \u2208 B(l2 ).\n(8.1)\nTt (x) =\n\u03a9\n\nSince Dt (\u03c9) is unitary, this formula shows that Tt is a completely positive contraction on B(l2 ).\nIn fact, (8.1) is the Stinespring representation of Tt . The semigroup (Tt ) satisfies all properties\n(0.I) - (0.IV) with M = B(l2 ) and \u03c4 being the usual trace on B(l2 ). Since (Pt ) is the Poisson\nsemigroup subordinated to (Tt ) via (4.2), (Pt ) has the same properties. Thus these semigroups\nextend to symmetric positive contractive semigroups on Sp for 1 \u2264 p < \u221e.\nThus we have the maximal inequalities in Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 5.1 for (Tt ) as well as\n(4.4) for (Pt ). Note that in this situation the a.u. convergence reduces to the uniform convergence\nin B(l2 ).\n8.4 Hamiltonians\nIn this subsection, M is semifinite and equipped with a normal faithful semifinite trace \u03c4 . Let\nL \u2208 L0 (M) be selfadjoint. We consider the Hamiltonian semigroup given by the generator ad L:\nad L(x) = Lx \u2212 xL,\n\nx \u2208 M.\n\nNote that\nSet\n\n(ad L)2 (x) = L2 x + xL2 \u2212 2LxL.\nTt = e\u2212t(ad L)\n\n2\n\nand Pt = e\u2212t |ad L| .\n\nIt is again well-known that these are completely positive contractive semigroups on M (see [Par,\nExample 30.1]). Since (Pt ) is the Poisson semigroup subordinated to (Tt ), it suffices to show this\nfor (Tt ). In fact, (Tt ) admits a Stinespring representation similar to (8.1):\n\u221a\n\u0003\n\u0002 \u221a\n(8.2)\nTt (x) = E ei t gL xe\u2212i t gL , x \u2208 M,\n45\n\n\f\u221a\nwhere g is a Gaussian variable with mean zero and variance 2 and E denotes the expectation\nwith respect to g. To check this, let us first write the spectral resolution of L:\nZ \u221e\nL=\n\u03bb de\u03bb .\n\u2212\u221e\n\nLet R > 0 and e be the spectral projection of L corresponding to the interval [\u2212R, R]. Consider\nx \u2208 M such that x = exe. Then\n(8.3)\n\nkLj xLk k \u2264 Rj+k kxk,\n\n\u2200 j, k \u2265 0.\n\nA simple induction shows\n(ad L)n (x) = (\u22121)n\n\nn\nX\n\n(\u22121)k Cnk Lk xLn\u2212k .\n\nk=0\n\nNow consider the formal power series representation\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221e\n\u221a\n\u0003\n\u0002 X\n\u0002 \u221a\n(i t)j (\u2212i t)k j+k j k \u0003\ng\nL xL\nE ei t gL xe\u2212i t gL = E\nj! k!\n=\n=\n\nj,k=0\n\u221e\nn n\nX\n\n(\u22121) t\nn!\nn=0\n\nX\n\nj+k=2n\n\n(2n)!\n(\u22121)k Lj xLk\nj! k!\n\n\u221e\nX\n2\n(\u22121)n tn\n(ad L)2n (x) = e\u2212t(ad L) (x).\nn!\nn=0\n\nNote that the series above are absolutely convergent due to (8.3). Thus (8.2) is proved for all\nx \u2208 M such\u221athat x = exe. However, the left hand side of (8.2) defines a normal contraction on\nM for exp(i t g(\u03c9)L) is a unitary in M for every \u03c9. On the other hand, limR\u2192\u221e 1l[\u2212R, R] (L) = 1\nweakly in M. By the w*-continuity, we see that (8.2) is true for all x \u2208 M. (8.2) also shows that\nTt preserves the trace \u03c4 . On the other hand, since (ad L)2 is positive on L2 (M), Tt is symmetric.\nThus the semigroup (Tt ) verifies (0.I) - (0.IV).\nRemark. Let us consider a particular case where M = B(l2 ) and L is a real diagonal matrix with\ndiagonal entries (\u03bb0 , \u03bb1 , * * * ). Then\n\u0001\n|ad L|(x) = |\u03bbj \u2212 \u03bbk |xjk j,k .\n\nThus |ad L| becomes a Schur multiplier and so (Tt ) reduces to the semigroup already considered\nin the previous example with H = R and f (j) = \u03bbj .\n8.5 Free product\n\nLet (Mi , \u03c6i )i\u2208I be a family of von Neumann algebras, each equipped with a normal faithful state\n\u03c6i . Let\n\u0001\n(M, \u03c6) = \u2217i\u2208I Mi , \u03c6i\n\nbe the von Neumann algebra reduced free product (cf. [V] and [VDN]). Recall that \u03c6 is a normal\nfaithful state on M. If all \u03c6i are tracial, so is \u03c6. Now for every i \u2208 I let be given a w*-continuous\nsemigroup (Tti )t\u22650 on Mi satisfying the following conditions:\ni) Tti is unital;\nii) \u03c6 \u25e6 Tti = \u03c6i ;\n46\n\n\fiii) Tti is completely positive.\nAs usual, we always assume T0i = idMi . Then by [BlD] (see also [Ch]) it follows that for each t\nthe family {Tti }i\u2208I defines a completely positive unital map Tt on M, preserving the state \u03c6. Tt is\nuniquely determined by its action on the monomials:\nTt (x1 * * * xn ) = Tti1 (x1 ) * * * Ttin (xn )\nfor any x1 , ..., xn with xk \u2208 M\u25e6ik and i1 6= i2 6= * * * 6= in , where M\u25e6i = {x \u2208 Mi : \u03c6i (x) = 0}. Tt\nis called the free product of the family {Tti }i\u2208I and denoted by Tt = \u2217i\u2208I Tti . Then it is easy to\nsee that (Tt ) is a w*- continuous semigroup on M. Thus this semigroup satisfies the conditions\n(7.I) - (7.III). By Lemma 7.1, (Tti ) and (Tt ) extend to norm continuous semigroups respectively on\nLp (Mi ) and Lp (M) for all 1 \u2264 p < \u221e.\nRecall that the modular group \u03c3t\u03c6 is the free product of the modular groups \u03c3t\u03c6i , i \u2208 I (cf.\n[Dy]). Thus if each Tti satisfies (7.IV), so does Tt . On the other hand, it is clear that the property\n(I.V) is also stable under free product.\nby\n\nLet us consider one special case. Note that Mi = C1Mi \u2295 M\u25e6i . Let Tti : Mi \u2192 Mi be defined\nTti\n\nC1Mi\n\n= idC1Mi\n\nand Tti\n\nM\u25e6\ni\n\n= e\u2212t idM\u25e6i ,\n\nt \u2265 0.\n\nThen it is easy to check that (Tti ) verifies the conditions i) - iii) above; moreover, Tti is symmetric\nrelative to \u03c6i . The corresponding free product semigroup (Tt ) is uniquely determined by\nTt (x1 * * * xn ) = e\u2212nt x1 * * * xn\nfor any x1 , ..., xn with xk \u2208 M\u25e6ik and i1 6= i2 6= * * * 6= in with n \u2208 N. This is the free analogue of\nthe classical Poisson semigroup on the unit circle. It plays an important role in [RX].\nThe fixed point subspace of (Tt ) above is simply C1M . Let us briefly discuss the pointwise\nconvergence in this case. Every element x \u2208 M admits the following formal development\nX X\nx1 * * * xn ,\nx = \u03c6(x) +\nn\u22651 i1 6= ***6=in\n\nwhere xk \u2208 M\u25e6ik . Then\nTt (x) = \u03c6(x) +\n\nX\n\ne\u2212nt\n\nn\u22651\n\nX\n\ni1 6= ***6=in\n\nx1 * * * xn .\n\nThus by the results in subsection 7.4,\nlim Tt (x) = x\n\nt\u21920\n\nand\n\nlim Tt (x) = \u03c6(x)\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\na.u.\n\nA similar result also holds for x \u2208 Lp (M) with 1 < p < \u221e.\n8.6 Group von Neumann algebras\nLet G be a discrete group. Let V N (G) denote the group von Neumann algebra of G. Recall that\nV N (G) is a von Neumann algebra on l2 (G) generated by the left regular representation \u03bb. Let \u03c4G\nbe the canonical faithful tracial state on V N (G), i.e. \u03c4G is the vector state given by the unit basis\nvector \u03b4e , where e is the identity of G and where {\u03b4g }g\u2208G denotes the canonical basis of l2 (G).\nNow we assume that G is equipped with a length function, denoted by | * |. More precisely, | * |\nis a positive function on G satisfying the following conditions:\ni) |e| = 0;\n47\n\n\fii) |g \u22121 | = |g| for any g \u2208 G;\niii) if d(f, g) = 12 (|f | + |g| \u2212 |f g \u22121 |), then for all f, g, h \u2208 G\nd(f, g) \u2265 min{d(f, h), d(h, g)}.\nBo\u017cejko [Bo1] proved that g 7\u2192 e\u2212t|g| is a positive definite function on G (see also [Bo2]). Thus the\nassociated Herz-Schur multiplier Tt is a normal completely positive unital map on V N (G). More\nprecisely, Tt is given on polynomials by\nX\n\u0001 X \u2212t|g|\nTt\nag \u03bb(g) =\ne\nag \u03bb(g).\ng\n\ng\n\nMoreover, Tt preserves the trace \u03c4G . Thus by Lemma 1.1, (Tt ) extends to a semigroup on\nLp (V N (G)) for all 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. Note that if G = Z, then V N (G) = L\u221e (T) and Tt becomes\nthe usual Poisson semigroup on T.\n\u03b1\nMore generally, it is proved in [Bo1] that for any 0 < \u03b1 < 1 the function g 7\u2192 e\u2212t|g| is positive\ndefinite on G. It follows that\nX\n\u0001 X \u2212t|g|\u03b1\nPt\nag \u03bb(g) =\ne\nag \u03bb(g)\ng\n\ng\n\ndefines a completely positive unital trace preserving semigroup on V N (G). This last statement\nalso follows from the previous for (Pt ) is subordinated to (Tt ) by (4.3).\nNow let us specify the situation above to free groups. Let G be a free group, say, G = Fn , a\nfree group on n generators {g1 , ..., gn } (n can be infinite). Let | * | be the length function with\nrespect to {g1 , ..., gn }. Then the fact that e\u2212t|*| is a positive definite function on Fn goes back to\nHaagerup [H4]. Note that this is also a special case of the free product in the previous example.\nIndeed, writing Fn as the reduced free product of n copies of Z, we have\n\u0001\n\u0001\nV N (Fn ), \u03c4Fn \u22171\u2264k\u2264n L\u221e (T), \u03c4Z .\n\nThen the semigroup on Fn appears as the free product of n copies of the usual Poisson semigroup\non T. Applying our ergodic theorems to this case, we get Theorem 0.3.\nMore generally, let {Gi }i\u2208I be a family of discrete groups, each equipped with a length function.\nLet Tti be the associated semigroup on Gi defined previously. Let G = \u2217i\u2208I Gi be the reduced free\nproduct. Then by [Bo1] (or the previous example), the free product Tt = \u2217i\u2208I Tti yields a symmetric\ncompletely positive contractive semigroup on G.\n8.7 q-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroups\nLet HR be a real Hilbert space and HC its complexification. For \u22121 \u2264 q \u2264 1 let Fq (HC ) be the\nq-Fock space based on HC constructed by Bo\u017cejko and Speicher (see [BS1] and [BS2]). Note that\nF1 (HC ), F\u22121 (HC ) and F0 (HC ) are respectively the symmetric, anti-symmetric and full (=free)\nFock spaces. Given a vector h \u2208 HC , let c(h) denote the associated (left) creation operator on\nFq (HC ). c(h) is a bounded operator for q < 1 and a closed densely defined operator for q = 1. Its\nadjoint c(h)\u2217 is the annihilation operator associated to h and denoted by a(h). Let\ngq (h) = c(h) + a(h),\n\nh \u2208 HR .\n\ngq (h) is a so-called q-Gaussian variable. Note that g1 (h) is a usual Gaussian variable, g0 (h) a\nsemi-circular variable in Voiculescu's sense (cf. [V] and [VDN]), and finally g\u22121 (h) corresponds to\na Fermion. The q-von Neumann algebra \u0393q (HR ) is the von Neumann algebra on Fq (HC ) generated\nby all q-Gaussians, namely,\n\u0393q (HR ) = {gq (h) : h \u2208 HR }\u2032\u2032 \u2282 B(Fq (HC )).\n48\n\n\fLet \u03a9 be the vacuum vector in Fq (HC ) and \u03c4q the associated vector state. Then \u03c4q is faithful\nand tracial. Hence \u0393q (HR ) is a type II1 von Neumann algebra for q < 1. (\u03931 (HR ) is commutative.)\nMoreover, it is a non injective factor if \u22121 < q < 1 and dim H \u2265 2. We refer to [BKS], [N] and\n[Ri] for more information.\nNow let S be a contraction on HR . Then S extends to a contraction on HC . The second\nquantization \u0393(S) is a normal completely positive unital trace preserving map on \u0393q (HR ). To give\nthe definition of \u0393(S), we recall the Wick product. Since \u03a9 is separating for \u0393q (HR ), the map\nx \u2208 \u0393q (HR ) 7\u2192 x(\u03a9) is injective. Its image is a dense subspace of Fq (HC ) (for \u03a9 is cyclic). It\nis easy to see that all elementary tensors belong to this image. The inverse map (defined on the\nimage) is called the Wick product, denoted by W . Thus if \u03be is a linear combination of elementary\ntensors, W (\u03be) is the unique operator in \u0393q (HR ) such that W (\u03be)\u03a9 = \u03be. Note that the collection of\nall such W (\u03be)'s forms a w*-dense \u2217-subalgebra of \u0393q (HR ). Then \u0393(S) is uniquely determined by\n\u0001\n\u0393(S) W (h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn ) W (Sh1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 Shn ), h1 , ..., hn \u2208 HC .\n\nApplying this construction to S = e\u2212t idHR for t \u2265 0, we get a normal completely positive unital\ntrace preserving map Tt = \u0393(e\u2212t idHR ). The action of Tt on the Wick products is given by\n\u0001\nTt W (h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn ) = e\u2212nt W (h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn ).\n\nThen (Tt ) is a semigroup on \u0393q (HR ) satisfying all conditions (0.I) - (0.IV). This is the q-OrnsteinUhlenbeck semigroup associated with HR . The negative of its infinitesimal generator is the socalled number operator. The case q = 1 and q = \u22121 corresponds respectively to the classical and\nFermionic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. (Tt )t in these two special cases have been extensively\nstudied. See [Bo3], [CaL] and [Bi] for related results.\nThe preceding discussion also applies to the quasi free case. Then the corresponding von\nNeumann algebras are of type III. See [Sh] for the case of q = 0 and [Hi] for the general case.\nIn particular, for q = \u22121, we have the classical Araki-Woods factors. In this case, the resulting\nsemigroup is the extension of the previous Fermionic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup to the type\nIII setting.\n\nReferences\n[BeL] Bergh, J. and L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, J.
