P. Sushkov, J. Oitmaa, and Zheng Weihong\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0007329v2 [cond-mat.str-el] 27 Jul 2000\n\nSchool of Physics, University of New South Wales, Sydney 2052, Australia\nWe analyze the phase diagram of the frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet, the J1 \u2212 J2 model,\nin two dimensions. Two quantum phase transitions in the model are already known: the second\norder transition from the N\u00e9el state to the spin liquid state at (J2 /J1 )c2 = 0.38, and the first\norder transition from the spin liquid state to the collinear state at (J2 /J1 )c4 = 0.60. We have found\nevidence for two new second order phase transitions: the transition from the spin columnar dimerized\nstate to the state with plaquette type modulation at (J2 /J1 )c3 = 0.50\u00b10.02, and the transition from\nthe simple N\u00e9el state to the N\u00e9el state with spin columnar dimerization at (J2 /J1 )c1 = 0.34 \u00b1 0.04.\nWe also present an independent calculation of (J2 /J1 )c2 = 0.38 using a new approach.\nPACS: 75.10.Jm, 75.30.Kz, 75.40.Gb, 75.30.Ds\n\nThe nature of the quantum disordered phases of lowdimensional quantum antiferromagnets is a topic of fundamental importance for the physics of quantum magnetism [1]. Such phases can result from mobile holes in\nan antiferromagnetic background as in the t \u2212 J or Hubbard model at finite doping. Alternatively, competition\nof purely magnetic interactions can also lead to destruction of long-range order. A typical example of the second\nkind is the J1 \u2212 J2 model which exhibits a quantum disordered (spin-liquid) phase due to second-neighbor frustrating interactions. Even though it has been intensively\nstudied during the last ten years, the J1 \u2212J2 model apparently still holds many secrets. This model is also an ideal\ntesting ground for the theory of quantum phase transitions because it has very complex dynamics and contains\na variety of transitions. Exact diagonalization studies [2]\nhave shown that the excitation spectrum of the model\nis quite complex and that finite-size effects are large [3].\nSpin-wave like expansions around the simple N\u00e9el state\n(which occurs for small frustration) naturally cannot give\nany information about the ground state at stronger frustration, and consequently non-perturbative methods are\nneeded to analyze the latter regime.\nAn important insight into the disordered regime was\nachieved by field-theory methods [4,5] and dimer series\nexpansions [6,5,7]. The above works have established\nthe range of the disordered regime, 0.38 < g < 0.60\n(g = J2 /J1 ), and have also shown that the ground state\nin this regime is dominated by short-range singlet (dimer)\nformation in a given pattern (see Fig.1). The stability of\nsuch a configuration implies that the lattice symmetry\nis spontaneously broken and the ground state is fourfold degenerate. This picture is somewhat similar to\nthe one dimensional situation, where the Lieb-SchultzMattis theorem guarantees that a gapped phase always\nbreaks the translational symmetry and is doubly degenerate, whereas gapless excitations correspond to a unique\nground state [8].\nTwo very recent calculations [9,10] performed by Green\nfunction Monte Carlo methods have raised new questions\non the structure of the intermediate phase. The authors\n\nof Ref. [9] claim stability of the \"plaquette RVB\" state\nat g \u2248 0.5. Reference [10] comes to a different conclusion: there is a columnar spin dimerized state with\nplaquette type modulation along the columns. An additional very interesting observation [10] is that the columnar spin dimerization penetrates into the N\u00e9el phase to\ng \u2248 0.3. To conclude the list of observations which do\nnot agree with a simple spin liquid with columnar dimerization we mention the divergence in the plaquette susceptibility found in Ref. [7] at g \u223c 0.5.\nIn the present paper we elucidate all the above questions and come to the conclusion that two additional\nquantum critical points exist in the phase diagram of\nthe system. These critical points correspond to a new\ngeneric type of second order quantum phase transition\nconsidered in Ref. [11]. At each of the critical points\npoints there is condensation of some singlet excitation\nand the critical dynamics is described by the nonlinear\nO(1) \u03c3-model.\nThe Hamiltonian of the J1 \u2212 J2 model reads:\nX\nX\nH = J1\nS i * S j + J2\nSi * Sj ,\n(1)\nnn\n\nnnn\n\nwhere J1 is the nearest-neighbor, and J2 is the frustrating\nnext-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg exchange on a square\nlattice (see Fig.1). Both couplings are antiferromagnetic,\ni.e. J1,2 > 0 and the spins Si = 1/2. We also use the\nnotation g = J2 /J1 . The spin columnar dimerization at\ng > gc2 is well established [4\u20137] and therefore we start\nour consideration from this state shown schematically in\nFig.1. If there is an instability with respect to some kind\nof additional ordering then the gap in the spectrum of\nsome singlet excitation must vanish at the corresponding\ncritical point [11]. We do not have a reliable technique\nfor direct calculation of the singlet gap, but we do have a\nwell developed series expansion technique for calculation\nof static susceptibilities. A static susceptibility is proportional to the corresponding Green's function at zero\nfrequency\n\u03c7q \u221d Gq (\u03c9 = 0) \u223c Zq /\u03c9q2 ,\n\n1\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere \u03c9q is the quasiparticle energy, and Zq is the quasiparticle residue. So at the critical point 1/\u03c7 must vanish\napproximately as (g \u2212 gc )\u03b3 , with \u03b3 \u2243 2(\u03bd \u2212 \u03b7), where \u03bd\nis the critical index for the spectral gap, \u2206 \u221d (g \u2212 gc )\u03bd ,\nand 2\u03b7 is the critical index for the quasiparticle residue,\nZ \u221d (g \u2212 gc )2\u03b7\nTo analyze possible plaquette type modulation we calculate the susceptibility of the spin columnar dimerized\nstate with respect to the field [7]\nX\n(\u22121)j Si,j * Si,j+1 ,\n(3)\nFP =\n\nput forward some time ago [4] and based on the analysis of the Sp(N ), N \u2192 \u221e field theory suggests that the\ndimer order appears simultaneously with disappearance\nof the N\u00e9el order, gc1 = gc2 . The dynamics in the vicinity of the critical point is described by the nonlinear O(3)\n\u03c3-model in spite of an additional dimer order parameter.\nThe additional gapless excitation is irrelevant to the critical dynamics because this excitation has extremely large\nsize [4]: r \u223c 1/(g \u2212 gc )M , M \u226b 1. Another possibility is\nthat gc1 < gc2 and hence there are two separated quantum phase transitions [13]. The transition at gc2 = 0.38\nis still described by the nonlinear O(3) \u03c3-model, while\nthe transition at gc1 is of the O(1)\u00d7O(1)-type. So in\nthe vicinity of the point gc1 there is an additional effective singlet field which can condense either at momentum\nk = (\u03c0, 0) or (0, \u03c0). The sign degeneracy of the scalar\nfield together with the momentum degeneracy gives a\nfour-fold degenerate ground state which exactly corresponds to the degeneracy of the spin-dimerized state. A\nrecent work based on the Green function Monte Carlo\nmethod [10] gives a hint in favor of this picture.\nLet us give the precise meaning to the terms relevant\nand irrelevant singlet excitation. We consider a quantum\ncritical point at which the singlet gap \u2206s vanishes. An\nexternal field which is coupled to the singlet excitation,\nhs|F |0i =\n6 0, is applied to the system. If the corresponding susceptibility given by eq. (2) is diverging at the\ncritical point we call this singlet excitation \"relevant\". If\nthe susceptibility is not diverging we call the singlet excitation \"irrelevant\". It is clear that for an irrelevant excitation the quasiparticle residue Z vanishes faster than\n\u22062s .\nTo analyze the problem of spin dimer order we calculate the susceptibility of the N\u00e9el state with respect to the\nexternal field which probes spin columnar dimerization.\nX\n(\u22121)i Si,j * Si+1,j .\n(5)\nFD =\n\ni,j\n\nwhich breaks the translational symmetry in the direction\nperpendicular to the dimers. The series has been computed up to the seventh order in the dimerization parameter. Results for 1/\u03c7P are shown in Fig. 2. The value of\n1/\u03c7P vanishes at gc3 = 0.50 \u00b1 0.02 and this is the critical point for the second order quantum phase transition\nfrom a simple columnar dimerized state to the 8-fold degenerate columnar dimerized state with plaquette type\nbond modulation in the direction perpendicular to the\ndimers suggested in Ref. [10]. This phase transition is of\nthe generic type considered in Ref. [11] and therefore it\nis described by 2D nonlinear O(1) \u03c3-model. The critical\nindexes for this model are [12]: \u03bd \u2248 0.630, \u03b7 \u2248 0.034.\nTherefore one shall expect \u03b3 = 2(\u03bd \u2212 \u03b7) \u2248 1.19. On the\nother hand the Dlog Pad\u00e9 approximants to the series \u03c7P\ngive \u03b3 = 0.9 \u00b1 0.1. This is fair agreement, and we offer an explanation for the small discrepancy. The phase\ntransition is related to the condensation of some singlet\nexcitation which can be considered as a bound state of\ntriplet excitations.\n|si = a2 |tti + a3 |ttti + a4 |tttti + ...\n\n(4)\n\nWe would like to stress that there is very strong mixing\nbetween two-triplet and multi-triplet bound states. This\nmixing was the reason why vanishing of the singlet gap at\ng = gc3 was missed in Reference [5]. In Ref. [5] analysis of\nthe singlet excitation was based on a two-particle BetheSalpeter equation with further account of multi-particle\ncontributions as a small perturbation. This assumption\nwas wrong because of the strong mixing. So at g = gc3 we\nhave condensation of effectively a multi-particle bound\nstate with relatively small two particle component. The\nmixing between two-particle and multi-particle components of the singlet excitation varies with g and this effect\ncannot be taken into account in the non-linear \u03c3-model\nwhich assumes condensation of an \"elementary\" (=structureless) field. Ultimately very close to the critical point\nthe variation of the mixing can be neglected and one shall\nexpect restoration of the pure \u03c3-model behavior. However it happens in so narrow vicinity of the critical point\nthat the present numerical data cannot assess it.\nLet us consider now the appearance of spin dimer order\nat g = gc1 as g is increased from small values. A scenario\n\ni,j\n\nIn this calculation we use the usual Ising series expansion\nup to seventh order. Note that in spite of the similarity\nbetween (3) and (5) these are two quite different situations. The field (3) assumes that the dimers aligned\nalong the i-direction already exist and it probes a possible modulation in the j-direction. The field (5) is applied\nto the N\u00e9el state and therefore it does not assume any\ndimer order. The values of 1/\u03c7D versus g are plotted in\nFig. 3. It is clear that 1/\u03c7D vanishes somewhere in the\ninterval g \u2208 [0.3, 0.4], but the data is not precise enough\nto distinguish gc1 from gc2 . To distinguish between the\ntwo scenarios discussed above we have to realize that Fig.\n3 clearly indicates the relevant singlet excitation. In the\ncase of an irrelevant singlet [4] the quasiparticle residue\nis extremely small, Z \u221d (g \u2212 gc )M , M \u226b 1 and hence\nthe susceptibility has no divergence at the critical point.\nThus we conclude from Fig. 3 that gc1 = 0.34 \u00b1 0.04,\n2\n\n\fand that gc1 < gc2 , so there is a region gc1 < g < gc2\nwhere the spin columnar dimer order and the N\u00e9el order\ncoexist. The critical dynamics at gc1 is described by the\nrelevant gapless singlet excitation. There is no doubt that\nthe irrelevant gapless singlet excitation at g \u2248 gc2 also\nexists, but it has an exponentially small residue [14] and\nhence its contribution to the susceptibility is negligible.\nThe final result we report here is a new way of estimating gc2 \u2243 0.38. The previous best calculation [5] was\nbased on vanishing of the triplet gap in the spin liquid\nphase. A previous attempt [15] to estimate gc2 by Ising\nexpansions for the staggered magnetization in the N\u00e9el\nphase showed the magnetization vanishing around 0.4,\nbut the series were erratic in this region and the precision low. The new estimate is based on Ising expansions\n[15] in the N\u00e9el phase for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd neighbor\ncorrelators hSix Sjx i and hSiz Sjz i, where z is the direction of\nstaggered magnetization. The series has been computed\nup to order 9 for 1st and 2nd neighbor correlators and\nto order 7 for 3rd neighbor correlator. The differences\nof these correlators are shown in Fig.4. The transition\npoint is identified by the condition hSix Sjx i = hSiz Sjz i,\ncorresponding to restoration of spin rotational symmetry\nto the ground state. This gives gc2 \u2243 0.38(3), in excellent\nagreement with previous results.\nIn conclusion, the zero temperature phase diagram\nand the excitation spectra of the J1 \u2212 J2 model are\nshown schematically in Fig. 5. There are four critical\npoints: gc1 = 0.34 \u00b1 0.04, gc2 = 0.38, gc3 = 0.50 \u00b1 0.02,\ngc4 = 0.60. The states are: g < gc1 - the simple N\u00e9el\nstate, gc1 < g < gc2 - the columnar dimerized N\u00e9el state,\ngc2 < g < gc3 - the simple columnar dimerized spin liquid, gc3 < g < gc4 - the columnar dimerized spin liquid\nwith plaquette type modulation, g > gc4 - the collinear\nstate. The transitions at gc1 and gc3 are second order\nphase transitions of the O(1)\u00d7O(1) and O(1) symmetry\nclasses correspondingly. Energies of the relevant singlet\nexcitations vanish at the critical points. The transition\nat gc2 is a second order phase transition described by the\nnonlinear O(3) \u03c3-model. The energy of the triplet excitation vanishes at g \u2264 gc2 ; at the critical point there is\nalso a singlet excitation with zero gap, but this singlet\nis irrelevant. The transition at gc4 is probably of first\norder, but is very close to second order.\nThis work forms part of a research project supported\nby a grant from the Australian Research Council.
