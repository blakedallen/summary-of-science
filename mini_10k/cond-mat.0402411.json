Up to\nnow, many economists have been worrying that econophysicists are just reinventing the wheel; while many physicists\nare studying properties of toy economic models that are not directly relevant to economics [1]. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the inequality of wealth in a simple-minded econophysical model known as the minority game (MG) using\nthe so-called replica trick [2, 3, 4]. By doing so, we hope to make a small step forward in the application of physical\nmethods when studying real economic systems.\nThe MG is a simple-minded model of a complex adaptive system which captures the cooperative behavior of selfish\nplayers in a real market. In this game, N players have to choose one of the two possible alternatives in each turn\nbased only on the minority sides in the previous M turns. The wealth of those who end up in the minority side will be\nincreased by one while the wealth of the others will be reduced by one. To aid the players in making their choice, each\nof them is randomly and independently assigned S deterministic strategies once and for all when the game begins.\nEach deterministic strategy is nothing but a map from the set of all possible histories (a string of the minority side\nof the previous M turns) to the set of the two possible alternatives. All players make their choices according to their\ncurrent best strategies [5, 6]. In the MG, the complexity of the system is usually indicated by the control parameter\n\u03b1 \u2261 2M+1 /N S which is the ratio of the size of the strategy space to the size of strategies at play [6, 7, 8].\nClearly, the mean attendance of either choice is N/2 as the game is symmetrical for both choices. In contrast, the\nvariance of this probability, which is conventionally denoted by \u03c3 2 (A), is highly non-trivial. It attains a very small\nvalue when \u03b1 \u2248 1, indicating that the players are cooperating [7]. That is why previous studies of the MG and its\nvariants [9, 10, 11] focus mainly on the study of \u03c3 2 (A).\nSince the strategies are assigned once and for all to each player, it is possible that some poorly-performing players\nare somehow forced to cooperate with some well-performing peers. Therefore, it makes sense to study the inequality\nof wealth in MG in detail.\nIn Section II, we introduce a common method that measures wealth inequality in economics known as the modified\nGini index. We then study the Gini index in the MG numerically in Section III. Our numerical simulation shows\nthat both the maximal cooperation point and the point of maximum wealth inequality occur around 2M+1 \u2248 N S.\nThis confirms our suspicion that the apparent cooperation of players shown in the \u03c3 2 (A) does not tell us the complete\nstory. In fact, we are able to explain the trend of a modified Gini index qualitatively using the crowd-anticrowd\ntheory [12, 13, 14]. In particular, we find that the cooperation comes along with wealth inequality partially because\npoorly-performing players cannot change their strategies in the MG. In this way, we show that the crowd-anticrowd\ntheory is not only able to explain \u03c3 2 (A), but also explains other features of other quantities in the MG. In Section IV,\nwe try to reproduce our numerically simulated Gini index in the so-called asymmetric phase using the replica method.\nwe recall that one has to average over the disorder variables in the conventional replica method; the direct application\nof the replica trick cannot provide the wealth distribution of players and thus the Gini index of the MG. Fortunately,\na careful semi-analytic application of the replica method can be used to reproduce the Gini index qualitatively as a\nfunction of \u03b1. Finally, we wrap up by giving a brief summary of our work in Section V.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nGINI INDEX WITH NEGATIVE WEALTH\n\nIn order to measure the inequality of wealth among players in the MG qualitatively, we follow our economics\ncolleagues employing the so-called Gini index. In the original definition, the Gini index G0 in a population is the\nmean of the absolute differences between the wealth all possible pairs of players [15]. That is to say,\nN\n1 X\n[1 + 2(N \u2212 j)] gj .\nG0 = 1 \u2212\nN j=1\n\n(1)\n\nIn the above equation, N is the number of players in the population, gj is the wealth earned by a player divided by\nthe total wealth in the population. and the gj 's are ranked in ascending order, i.e., g1 \u2264 g2 \u2264 . . . \u2264 gN . Clearly, G0\nranges from 0 to 1. The larger G0 , the more serious the wealth inequality. If G0 = 0, the players' wealth is uniformly\ndistributed. If G0 \u2243 1, one of the players possesses the total wealth of the population and the wealth inequality is\nserved. However, Eq. (1) is only applicable in two cases: (1) all players have positive wealth; or (2) all players have\nnegative wealth. Since players in the MG may have positive or negative wealth, we cannot use G0 , in general, to\nmeasure wealth inequality. We employ an extension of G0 , introduced by Chen et al., known as the modified Gini\nindex G [16, 17, 18], is given by\nN\nN +1\n2 X\njgj \u2212\nN j=1\nN\nG=\n\"\n#,\nPk\nk\nk\n2 X\n1 X\nj=1 gj\n1+\njgj +\ngj\n\u2212 (1 + 2k)\nN j=1\nN j=1\ngk+1\n\n(2)\n\nPk+1\nPk\nwhere k is defined in such a way that j=1 gj < 0 and j=1 gj > 0. For simplicity, we refer to the modified Gini\nindex G as the Gini index from now on. Just like the original Gini index G0 , the modified Gini index G measures the\nnormalized wealth inequality of players. Again, G ranges from 0 to 1. The larger the value of G, the more serious the\nPk\nwealth inequality. When all players are equally wealthy, i.e., k = 0, the term j=1 jgj vanishes and G becomes zero.\nPN \u22121\nIn contrast, if the total wealth of the system is owned by a single player, i.e., gN = 1 and the term j=1 jgj = 0, then\nG attains a value of one as N \u2192 \u221e. Also, G is reduced to the original Gini index G0 when all players have positive\nwealth or all players have negative wealth. Moreover, G is unchanged if the wealth of each player is multiplied by a\nnon-zero constant.\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS AND QUALITATIVE EXPLANATIONS\n\nIn this section, we investigate the wealth inequality of the players in the MG. Since we are only interested in\nstudying the generic properties of the Gini index, we average the Gini index over Nr = 500 independent runs.\nBecause G measures the normalized wealth distribution of players rather than simply the first and second moments\nof this distribution, the time of convergence of Gini index G is much longer than that of the variance of attendance\nand it differs for different initial configurations of the system. So we employ an adaptive scheme to check for system\nequilibration before taking any measurement. Specifically, in each run, we record the time series of G until the\nabsolute difference of G between 10000 successive steps is less than 10\u22126 . Then, we obtain the equilibrated value of G\nby using finite size scaling. Finally, we take G to be the average over 50 measurements each separated by 1000 steps.\nwe recall from Section II that G is a measure of the normalized wealth distribution. From our numerical simulation,\nG equilibrates logarithmically and slowly although the wealth of players is decreasing in each turn. We will explain\nthe reason for convergence of G in detail at the end of this section. We have performed numerical simulations for the\ncases where players draw their strategies from full strategy space and reduced strategy space [5, 8] respectively. The\nGini indices obtained in these two cases are very similar. Since the analytical investigation performed in Section IV is\nsimpler if we focus on reduced strategy space, we present the numerical results based on reduced strategy space here\nfor consistency.\nLet us study the Gini index averaged over the initial conditions hGi\u039e versus the control parameter \u03b1 as shown in\nFig. 1. (Note that we use h.i\u039e to denote the average over the initial configuration of the system.) Our numerical\nresults show that the curves of hGi\u039e for different M coincide. which means that the Gini index hGi\u039e , just like the\nvariance of attendance, depends only on the control parameter \u03b1 in the MG.\nWe now move on to discuss the properties of the Gini index hGi\u039e as a function of \u03b1 in detail. Fig. 1 shows that\nthe Gini index hGi\u039e is small when \u03b1 \u2192 0. In other words, the wealth of all players is roughly the same in such a\n\n\f3\ncase. In fact, the small value of hGi\u039e can be explained by the crowd-anticrowd theory [12, 13, 14] as follows. In the\nsmall \u03b1 regime, players are likely to have at least one high ranking strategy at each instance, as each player possesses\na relatively large portion of strategies of the reduced strategy space. Thus, most of the players are using the crowd\nof high ranking strategies, i.e., those high ranking strategies are overcrowded. Due to the overcrowding of strategies,\neach strategy alternatively wins and loses one virtual score repeatedly when the same history appears, under the\nperiod-two dynamics [7, 19]. That is to say, each strategy has approximately the same probability to win for any\nhistory. Therefore, all players have roughly the same amount of wealth and this leads to a small Gini index hGi\u039e .\nAs the control parameter \u03b1 increases, the Gini index hGi\u039e rises rapidly and subsequently attains its maximum\nvalue when the number of strategies at play is approximately equal to the reduced strategy space size. To explain\nthis, we recall that the aim of each player in the MG is to maximize one's own wealth, which is achieved under\nthe maximization of the global profit [8]. Subsequently, the attendance of each choice always tends to \u230aN/2\u230b upon\nequilibration for all values of \u03b1 since the two alternatives are symmetric in the MG. That is to say, the system always\n\"distributes\" approximately the same amount of wealth to the population in each turn regardless of the value of \u03b1.\nMoreover, whenever \u03b1 \u2248 \u03b1c , unlike in the cases of symmetric and asymmetric phases of the MG, it is not uncommon\nfor a player to hold only low ranking strategies since the number of strategies at play and the reduced strategy space\nsize are of the same order. Consequently, a significant number of players are forced to use the crowd of low ranking\nstrategies and keep on losing. On the other hand, those players picking the crowd of high ranking strategies have\na higher winning probability and keep on using those strategies. Note that the ranking of the strategies is almost\nunchanged when \u03b1 \u2248 \u03b1c [12, 13, 14]. As a result, the wealth distribution of players would become relatively diverse\nand the Gini index hGi\u039e of the population attains its maximum value when \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1c .\nActually, the increase in the Gini index when \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1+\nc can be justified by the frozen probability of the MG. We\nrecall that in the MG a player employs the virtual score system to determine which strategy to use in the next time\nstep. In the asymmetric phase, the probability that a strategy assigned to a player has a virtual score asymptotically\nhigher than all the other strategies assigned to the same player increases as \u03b1 decreases. Some players end up using\nonly one strategy after the system equilibrates, they are regard as frozen players. The frozen probability indicates the\nnumber of frozen players. A small frozen probability, i.e. most players in the game keep changing their best strategies,\nimplies that only a few player will keep on winning or keep on losing all the time and the Gini index should be low.\nOn the other hand, a high frozen probability may indicate that while some frozen players are using strategies that\nwin most of time, the best performing strategies for the other frozen players are losing badly. Thus, there is a wide\nspread in wealth distribution of players. The Gini index should be high in this case. The frozen probability follows\nthe same trend of Gini index as \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1+\nc , which further supports the validity of the result of the Gini index. Moreover,\nwhen \u03b1 \u2248 \u03b1c , it is likely that those frozen players which form the majority of crowds and anti-crowds in the game use\nanti-correlated strategy pairs, resulting in effective crowd-anticrowd cancellation between frozen players. Also, those\nfrozen players who picked the anti-correlated strategy pairs keep winning or keep losing throughout the game.\nAfter attaining the maximum value, the Gini index hGi\u039e decreases and gradually tends to zero when the control\nparameter \u03b1 further increases. According to crowd-anticrowd theory [12, 13, 14], it is because most of the strategies\nat play are uncorrelated to each other when the strategy space size becomes much larger than the number of strategies\nat play. Therefore, it is as if each player is making random choices in the game when \u03b1 is large. Hence, the winning\nprobability of all strategies is roughly the same. As a result, the Gini index hGi\u039e of the population is small in this\nregime.\nAs we have reasoned above, the winning probability of each individual player is steady after equilibration of the\nsystem. Since the wealth distribution depends solely on the winning probabilities of individual players, the gj 's, and\nhence the Gini index G, converge over a sufficiently long time. Moreover, it is easy to check that the gj 's converge\nlogarithmically. Therefore, the equilibration time for G is much longer than that of \u03c3 2 (A).\nIV.\n\nSEMI-ANALYTICAL STUDY OF THE GINI INDEX IN MG USING THE REPLICA TRICK\nA.\n\nMethodology\n\nIn the previous section, we have explained the wealth inequality of the players in the MG qualitatively. In fact, the\nsystem of the MG can be described as a disorder spin system [2, 3] since the dynamics of the MG indeed minimizes\na global function related to market predictability. In this section, we calculate the Gini index G of the population in\nMG semi-analytically by mapping the MG to a spin glass. As we shall see, this approach works well whenever \u03b1 > \u03b1c .\nLet us start to link the MG, a repeated game with N players, to the spin glass. In this formalism, every player has\nto choose one out of two actions \u00b11 corresponding to the two alternatives at each time step. We denote the action\nof the ith player at time t by ci (t). After all players have chosen their actions, those players choosing the minority\naction win and gain one unit of wealth while all the others lose one. In the MG, the only public information available\n\n\f4\nto the players is the so-called history, which is the string of the minority action of the last M time steps. Namely,\nthe history is a string, (\u03a0(t \u2212 M ), . . . , \u03a0(t \u2212 1)) where \u03a0(t) denotes the minority action at time t. For convenience,\nwe label the history by an index \u03bc as follows:\n\u03bc(t) = \u03a0(t \u2212 M ) \u00d7 2M\u22121 + \u03a0(t \u2212 M \u2212 1) \u00d7 2M\u22122 + . . . + \u03a0(t \u2212 1).\n\n(3)\n\nAt the beginning of the game, each player picks once and for all S strategies randomly from the strategy space. In fact,\na strategy specifies an action a\u03bcs,i taken by the ith player for all possible histories \u03bc = 1, . . . , 2M . In the MG, agents\nmake use of the virtual score, i.e., the hypothetical profit for using a strategy throughout the game, to evaluate the\nperformance of a strategy. To guess the next global minority action, each player uses their own current best strategy\nwhich is the strategy with the highest virtual score at that moment. Assuming each player has S = 2 strategies which\nare labeled by '+\u2032 and '\u2212\u2032 , we define the disorder variables {\u03c9i\u03bc , \u03bei\u03bc } as:\nwi\u03bc =\n\na\u03bc+,i \u2212 a\u03bc\u2212,i\na\u03bc+,i + a\u03bc\u2212,i\n, \u03bei\u03bc =\n.\n2\n2\n\n(4)\n\nHere we use the spin variable si (t) = \u00b11 to denote the strategy used by the ith player at time t. Thus, the action of\nthis player is given by\n\u03bc(t)\n\nci (t) = \u03c9i\n\n\u03bc(t)\n\n+ si (t)\u03bei\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nWith the above formalism, we can employ a statistical tool called the replica trick [3, 4] to study the stationary state\nproperties of the MG by solving the ground state of the Hamiltonian H:\nH{m}\n~ = \u03a92 + 2\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03a9\u03bei mi +\n\ni=1\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03bei \u03bej mi mj ,\n\n(6)\n\ni,j\n\nP\n\u03bc\nwhere mi \u2261 hsi (t)i and \u03a9\u03bc = N\ni=1 \u03c9i . Note that O denotes the average over history \u03bc and h.i denotes the average\nover time t. In other words, our aim is to find the minimum of H{m}\n~ defined by:\nmin\n\nN\nm\u2208[\u22121,1]\n~\n\nH{m}\n~ = \u2212 lim\n\n\u03b2\u2192\u221e\n\n1\nhln Z(\u03b2)i\u039e ,\n\u03b2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the partition function\n\u2212\u03b2H{m}\n~\nZ(\u03b2) = Trm\n.\n~e\n\n(8)\n\nHere, Trm\n~ on [\u22121, 1]N , h.i\u039e denotes the average over the disorder variables a\u03bcs,i (i.e., the\n~ denotes the integral of m\nquenched disorder \u039e of the system) and \u03b2 stands for the inverse temperature. In fact, the ground state solution of H\ndepends on the disorder variables. However, in the thermodynamic limit, the ground state of H has a unique solution\nfor all quenched disorder. Thus, in the replica calculation, we seek for ground state solution of the Hamiltonian\nH on average of the quenched disorder. In order to evaluate hln Zi\u039e , we construct the partition function Z n by\nstudying n (a non-negative integer) replicas of the system with identical disorder variables {a\u03bcs,i }. Then, we perform\na semi-analytical continuation to extend this function for non-integer n. In this way, the average of ln Z over {a\u03bcs,i }\nis reduced to\nhln Zi\u039e = lim\n\nn\u21920\n\n1\nlnhZ n i\u039e .\nn\n\nWe also define the free energy density F\u03b2 (Q\u0302, r\u0302) by\nZ\nZ\nh\ni\nhZ n i\u039e = dr\u0302 dQ\u0302 exp \u2212\u03b2nN F\u03b2 (Q\u0302, r\u0302) ,\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nPN a b\nwhere Qa,b = N1\ni mi mi is the overlap matrix and ra,b are the associated Lagrange multipliers. Hence, we can find\nthe stationary state solution of H in the thermodynamic limit N \u2192 \u221e by finding the minima of F\u03b2 (Q\u0302, r\u0302) as:\nlim\n\nmin\n\nN\nN \u2192\u221e m\u2208[1,\u22121]\n~\n\nH{m}\n\u2248 lim lim min F\u03b2 (Q\u0302, r\u0302).\n\u03b2\u2192\u221e n\u21920\nN\n\n(11)\n\n\f5\nIn fact, we can find the minima in the replica symmetric (RS) ansatz by solving the saddle point equations [4, 10]:\n\u2202F\u03b2\n\u2202F\u03b2\n= 0 and\n= 0 \u2200a, b.\n\u2202ra,b\n\u2202Qa,b\n\n(12)\n\nIn this ansatz, the matrices r\u0302, Q\u0302 corresponding to min F\u03b2 , are assumed to be in the following form:\nQa,b\n\n\u001a\nN\n1 X a b\nq for a 6= b ,\n=\nmi mi =\nQ for a = b ,\nN i\n\n(13)\n\nand\nra,b =\n\n\u001a\n\n2r for a 6= b ,\nR for a = b ,\n\n(14)\n\nfor all a, b = 1, 2, . . . , n. Therefore, using the RS ansatz, the minimum value of F\u03b2 in the n \u2192 0 limit is given by\nF (RS) = lim min F\u03b2 (Q\u0302, r\u0302)\nn\u21920\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014Z 1\n\u0015\nZ\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1(1 + q)\n1\n\u03b1\u03b2\n=\nln 1 + (Q \u2212 q) +\n\u2212\n(RQ \u2212 rq),\nd\u03a6(\u03bb) ln\ndm exp(\u2212\u03b2V (m|\u03bb)) +\n2\u03b2\n\u03b1\n2[\u03b1 + \u03b2(Q \u2212 q)] \u03b2\n2\n\u22121\n(15)\n\u221a\n2\nwhere \u03a6(\u03bb) is the normal distribution and the potential V (m|\u03bb) = \u2212 \u03b1r\u03bbm + \u03b1\u03b2\n2 (r \u2212 R)m .\nUsing the saddle point equations, we arrive at [4, 10]\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012\n1\n\u03c1\n2 1 \u2212 \u03c12\n\u03b1\n2 \u2212\n\u221a\n1\n\u2212\n=\n2\n\u2212\ne\n,\nerf\n\u03c12\n\u03c0\u03c1\n\u03c12\n2\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is a disorder variable and depends on the control parameter \u03b1. The probability distribution of the 'average\naction' of a player, m, is then given by [3]\nP (m) =\n\n2\n\u03c1\n\u03c6(\u03c1)\n[\u03b4(m \u2212 1) + \u03b4(m + 1)] + \u221a e\u2212(\u03c1m) /2 ,\n2\n2\u03c0\n\n(17)\n\n\u221a\nwhere \u03c6(\u03c1) = 1 \u2212 erf(\u03c1/ 2), \u03b4(0) = 1 and \u03b4(x) = 0 whenever x 6= 0. Note that Eqs. (16) and (17) are only valid for\n\u03b1 > \u03b1c . For \u03b1 < \u03b1c , the replica calculation cannot give correct predictions for the probability distribution of spin\nvariable m because it is unable to reproduce the period-two dynamics of the system [4].\nOur aim is to calculate the Gini index of the players in the MG using the replica trick. At first glance, one might\nargue that the distribution of gi can be reproduced analytically using the replica trick. However, the replica trick\ncan only generate the average gain of a group of players rather than the wealth of an individual player. This is\nwhy Challet did not compute the theoretical gain of individual players analytically by using the replica trick for the\nMG. In fact, he computes the gain semi-analytically using the disorder spin variable mi measured in the simulations\ninstead [10, 20]. To reproduce the wealth distribution of players, we need to know the actions of each individual player\nsi (t) at time t for each individual particular quenched disorder. However, si (t) cannot be found by the replica trick.\nSo we approximate si (t) by the disorder spin variable mi generated stochastically from the distribution P (m) which\nis found by the replica trick. Then, the Gini index G(\u039e) can be calculated from the wealth distribution of the players\nfor that quenched disorder. As we are only interested in the generic properties of the Gini index, we calculate the Gini\nindex averaged over quenched disorder hGi\u039e . This should be done by calculating the Gini index of each individual\nquenched disorder G(\u039e) first and then taking average over all quenched disorders.\nIn practice, we perform the stochastic simulation to generate the wealth distribution of population in the MG for an\nindividual quenched disorder in the following way. Before starting the simulation, the quenched disorder \u039e is formed\nby allowing each player to pick two strategies randomly from the reduced strategy space. Next, each player draws\nthe spin variable m from the distribution P (m) as shown in Eq. (17). Those players with m = \u00b11 are called frozen\nplayers because they keep on using a strategy throughout the game. Then, in each step of the game, players choose\none of their own strategies according to their own spin variable m to guess the next global minority side. In practice,\nthe strategy used by the ith player at time t, \u03c3i (t), is chosen by calling a uniform random variate \u03b6 on [\u22121, 1]. Then\n\n\f6\nwe set \u03c3i (t) = 1 if mi \u2265 \u03b6 and \u03c3i (t) = \u22121 otherwise. Therefore, for the history \u03bd(t), the action of the ith player at\ntime t can be written as\n\u03bd(t)\n\n\u03c7i (t) = \u03c9i\n\n\u03bd(t)\n\n+ \u03c3i (t)\u03bei\n\n.\n\n(18)\n\nNote that the history \u03bd(t) is generated randomly at each time step t in our simulation. In addition, the difference in\nthe numbers of players choosing the two alternatives at time t is given by\nX(t) =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03c7i (t).\n\n(19)\n\ni=1\n\nSo we obtain the minority side at time t\n\u0398(t) = \u2212sign(X(t)).\n\n(20)\n\nAfter determining the minority side, the wealth of the ith players, wi (t), is updated by\nwi (t + 1) = wi (t) + 2\u03b4(\u03c7i (t) \u2212 \u0398(t)) \u2212 1.\n\n(21)\n\nWe repeat the above algorithm Ns times for the system to equilibrate. After the equilibration, we measure on the\nGini index of the population for the quenched disorder \u039e using Eq. (2). Then we calculate the average Gini index\nfor 500 independent runs. We denote the Gini index calculated by this algorithm with averaging over the quenched\ndisorder by hGiR\n\u039e . In fact, we find that the average Gini index hGi\u039e converges after Ns = 500P iterations, where\nP = 2M is the number of possible histories.\nB.\n\nSemi-Analytical Results Using Stochastic Simulation\n\nFig. 2 gives the Gini index obtained from semi-analytical calculation of hGiR\n\u039e versus the control parameter \u03b1 for\nMG with \u03b1 > \u03b1c . We find that the trend of the curves of hGiR\nagrees\nwith\nthe numerical findings. This implies\n\u039e\nthat we have successfully reproduced the numerical results of the Gini index in the asymmetric phase of the MG by\nusing the replica method. However, the curves of hGiR\n\u039e are systematically lower than those from numerical simulation.\nThis is because the coupling between the actions of players and the dynamics of the system is completely ignored in\nour stochastic simulation as the actions of the players depend only on the spin variable m. Consequently, the global\ncooperation among the players is suppressed in our semi-analytical calculation. Hence, the wealth distribution of\nplayers is less diverse which results in under-estimation of the Gini index in the MG.\nTo make our semi-analytical calculation more \"realistic\", we allow the history \u03bd(t) to be updated sequentially by\n\u03bd(t) = [2\u03bd(t \u2212 1) + \u0398(t)] mod P,\n\n(22)\n\nand we denote the Gini index averaged over the quenched disorder calculated in this approach by hGiS\u039e . Note that\nS\nhGiR\n\u039e and hGi\u039e are calculated using the same algorithm except that the history is updated in a different way. Fig. 3\nshows the Gini index hGiS\u039e versus the control parameter \u03b1 in the MG. We observe that the values of hGiS\u039e agree well\nwith the numerical results when \u03b1 is large. According to crowd-anticrowd theory, if \u03b1 is large, most strategies of\nthe players are uncorrelated to each other due to the under-sampling of the strategy space. Moreover, most of the\nstrategies are used by either one or none of the players in the MG whenever \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e. Therefore, the cooperation\nbetween the players can be neglected for \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e. In addition, the probability of the occurrence of different histories\nis not the same in the MG when \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e [21]. Indeed, these two conditions are satisfied in our stochastic simulation\nusing the sequential history. So, the values of hGiS\u039e match the numerical estimates when \u03b1 is large.\nS\nOn the other hand, when \u03b1 approaches \u03b1+\nc , the values of hGi\u039e become larger than the numerical results. This\ndiscrepancy can be explained as follows. As mentioned in Section III, since there is effective crowd-anticrowd cancellation, the history in the MG becomes more uniform as \u03b1 approaches \u03b1+\nc [21]. In contrast, although players still have\nthe same chance to pick anti-correlated pairs separately at the beginning of the game in our sequential simulation,\nthe strategy actually used by each player at each turn is not determined by its virtual score, but a randomly assigned\ndisorder spin variable mi instead. Consequently, two players are less likely to be frozen on an anti-correlated strategy\npair. This makes the crowd-anticrowd cancellation less effective among frozen players in our sequential simulation.\nSo, the actions among these frozen players may give a strong bias in the output, especially for \u03b1 \u2248 \u03b1c , where frozen\nprobability is highest. In turn, the history becomes much more non-uniform. This greatly increases the Gini index as\nsome players have more chance to stay at the winning (or losing) side.\nS\nFinally, we remark that both hGiR\n\u039e and hGi\u039e calculated by the stochastic simulation are independent of M . This\nis expected, since the results of the replica calculation do not depend explicitly on M .\n\n\f7\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn summary, we have investigated the inequality of wealth among players in the MG using the well-known measure\nin economics called the Gini index. In particular, our numerical findings show that the wealth inequality of players is\nvery severe near the point of maximum global cooperation \u03b1c . That is to say, in the minority game, global cooperation\ncomes hand in hand with uneven distribution of players' wealth. Specifically, a significant number of players are forced\nto use the low ranking strategies and cooperate with those players using the high ranking strategies since the number\nof strategies at play and the reduced strategy space size are of the same order whenever \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1c . In this respect, we\nhave showed that the crowd-anticrowd theory offers a simple and effective platform to study the wealth inequality in\nthe MG.\nIn addition, we have studied the Gini index semi-analytically by mapping the system of the MG to a spin glass.\nWith this formalism, we semi-analytically reproduce our numerically simulated Gini index in the asymmetric phase\nof MG by investigating the stationary state properties of MG using the replica trick.\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nWe would like to thank the Computer Center of HKU for their helpful support in providing the use of the High\nPerformance Computing Cluster for the simulation reported in this paper.
