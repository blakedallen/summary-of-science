In comparison with high-temperature\ncuprates, MgB2 superconductors have more than two times lower anisotropy,\nsignificantly larger coherence length, and higher transparency of grain boundaries to\nthe current flow. At the same time, when compared to conventional metallic\nsuperconductors (including Nb3Sn or NbN), they have at least two times higher\ncritical temperature Tc and energy gap, as well as higher critical current density jc. As\na result, MgB2 superconductors are expected to play an important role for highcurrent, high-field applications, as well as in cryoelectronics, where they might be the\nmaterial-of-choice for above-300-GHz clock-rate digital electronics. In addition,\nMgB2 devices could operate in simple cryocoolers.\nThe availability of high-quality superconducting thin films with single-crystallike transport properties2 is the key to realization of practical MgB2 cryoelectronic\ndevices. The films with high values of Tc and jc have been prepared on SrTiO3,\nAl2O3, Si, SiC, and other substrates by various deposition techniques.3\u20138 All of the\nabove procedures required post-annealing at temperatures higher than 600qC, and the\nsuperconducting properties of the resulting films depended very strongly on the\nconditions of their annealing. The best reported MgB2 thin films are characterized by\n\nTc | 39 K and jc > 107 A/cm2 at 4.2 K and 5 u 105 A/cm2 at 30 K, both at zero\nexternal magnetic field.9 Preparation of MgB2 thin films on unconventional\nsubstrates, such as stainless steel10 or plastic foils, is also desirable. MgB2-on-steel\n\u0015\n\n\ffilms are interesting for preparation of low-magnetic shielding and antennas, while\nplastic foils are very attractive for their bending and shaping abilities.\nIn this letter, we present the preparation and superconducting properties of\nMgB2 thin films fabricated on flexible substrates (Kapton-E polyamide foil), using\nthree specially designed, rapid annealing processes. Flexible plastic substrates\nintroduce a number of novel aspects to superconducting technology, such as the\nability to cut the final structures into desired shapes for, e.g., magnetic shielding. They\nare also unbreakable and can be rolled into small superconducting coils or form\nflexible microwave or high-speed digital microstrips and coplanar transmission lines.\n\nKapton-E foils up to 20 u 20 cm2 (limited by our deposition apparatus) were\n\ncleaned in acetone, ultrasonically washed in ethanol, and air-dried before being placed\nin our vacuum chamber. Mg-B precursor films 100-nm to 200-nm thick with a\nnominal composition of 1:2 were prepared on the unheated foil by simultaneous\nevaporation of Mg (purity 99.8%) and B (purity 99.9 %) from separate W and Ta\nresistive heaters at a vacuum of 8 u 10\u00104 Pa. After the deposition, the Mg-B films\n\nwere ex-situ annealed in a special low-temperature process to avoid overheating the\nKapton foil, which had to be kept below its 300qC deformation temperature.\nSeveral rapid annealing procedures have been implemented. Initially, the\nMg-B films were placed inside a quartz tube on a thick sapphire plate and introduced\nfor 10 to 300 s into a preheated furnace. The furnace temperature varied from 350qC\nto 500qC, and the Ar atmosphere could be changed from 3 kPa to 100 kPa in a flow\nregime. In another approach, the Mg-B films were placed \"face down\" on a resistive\nheater and annealed at 500qC to 600qC in pure Ar for 60 to 180 s. For overheating\n\u0016\n\n\fprotection, the foil was covered with a sapphire plate and a large Cu block on top.\nAfter annealing, samples were cooled down within approximately 30 s to room\ntemperature. Both of the above annealing methods resulted in superconducting MgB2\n\nwith Tc,on up to 33 K and a transition temperature 'Tc | 10 K. The highest Tc,on was\nobtained after annealing for 180 s at 500qC on a resistive heater. Unfortunately, under\nsuch conditions, the Kapton foil changed its color from yellow to black and partially\nlost its flexibility. The maximal jc was only about 500 A/cm2 at 4.2 K, suggesting that\nthe damaged foil stressed the MgB2 film.\nMuch better results were obtained using the third annealing method. Thus, the\nremainder of the work will be devoted to those films. The Mg-B thin films were\nradiatively heated with halogen lamps in vacuum; simultaneously, the substrate side\nof our samples was placed on an external water-cooled radiator to protect the plastic\nfoil. The distance between the samples and the halogen source was 7 cm, and the\nvacuum chamber was pumped down to a base pressure of 1 u 10\u00102 Pa in order to\nminimize the oxygen content and other gas impurities during annealing. The foil\ntemperature was controlled by a thermocouple located very close to its surface. Time\nduration of the annealing process was 60 to 180 s, and temperatures at the film surface\nvaried from 300qC to 650qC. After annealing, the vacuum chamber was filled with Ar\nand the films were cooled to room temperature in 20 to 30 s. Even for the highest MgB annealing temperature the Kapton was always maintained below 300qC, no\ndeformation or change of its color was observed, and the resulting MgB2 samples\nwere fully flexible.\n\n\u0017\n\n\fFigure 1 shows the surfaces and the critical temperature parameters of three\nfilms annealed under different conditions. For samples annealed for at least 1 min in\ntemperatures of 550qC to 650qC at the film surface, the film morphology exhibited\ndomains or lamellar structures [Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively] and their maximal\nTc,on was only 20 K and 30 K, respectively. The film presented in Fig. 1(b) showed\nsigns of the heat-induced substrate damage and although its Tc,on was high, the 'Tc\nwas very wide. After extensive trial-and-error studies, we realized that the best\nannealing conditions consisted of preheating at 300qC and only very brief, 30-s\nheating at 600qC, followed by post-heating for 60 s again at 300qC. The films\nproduced in this manner were characterized by very smooth surfaces [Fig. 1(c)],\nwithout domains, cracks, or lamellar structures. The x-ray diffraction measurement\nexhibited no diffraction peaks, thus indicating an amorphous phase in analogy with\nsimilar post-annealed MgB2 films, prepared on Si/SiO2 and sapphire substrates from\nMg-B precursors.6\nThe homogeneity of our thin films was studied by Auger spectroscopy. The\nAuger spectra (Fig. 2) show a strong non-stoichiometry of Mg and B on the film\nsurface, as well as an enhanced content of oxygen and presence of carbon. The\ndamaged surface layer was only ~20 nm thick, however, as estimated by the rate of\nMg-B etching and scanning electron microscopy studies. The bulk of the film had a\nuniform 1:2 stoichiometry ratio, with only small oxygen content, apparently from the\nresidual oxygen in the annealing vacuum chamber.\nThe films prepared according to the annealing recipe shown in Fig. 1(c) also\nhad the best superconducting properties. The maximal obtained Tc,on was 29.3 K, as\n\u0018\n\n\fshown in Fig. 3, where we plotted the resistive superconducting transitions for both\nthe stripe cut from a film by scissors and the one patterned by photolithography and\nAr ion etching. The cut stripe was approximately 1-mm wide and represents the\nsuperconducting properties of our plain MgB2 films, while the patterned bridge was\n10-Pm wide and 120-Pm long. We note that Ar-ion etching resulted in a slight\n\nreduction of Tc,on; at the same time, however, 'Tc narrowed to 2 K. The patterned\nmicrobridge was also used for jc measurements. The inset in Fig. 3 shows the jc\n\ndependence on temperature together with the fit based on the jc(T) = k(1\u0010T/Tc)D\nexpression, where k is a constant and D is the fitting parameter. The fit shown in\n\nFig. 3 was obtained for D = 2 and indicates that our film is granular with a network of\nsuperconductor\u2013normal metal\u2013superconductor (SNS) weak links.11,12 At 4.2 K, jc\nreached the value >7 u 105 A/cm2.\n\nIn conclusion, the preparation of the superconducting MgB2 thin films on the\nflexible plastic foils has been presented. Our films were amorphous and exhibited a\nvery smooth surface. The films were annealed under optimal conditions, using rapid\nradiative (halogen lamps) Mg-B annealing and simultaneous water-cooling of the\n\nKapton foil, and were characterized by Tc,on of about 29 K, 'Tc of about 3 K, and jc >\n7 u 105 A/cm2 at 4.2 K. The measured jc(T) characteristics indicated the presence of\nthe SNS weak-link network in our films. The Auger measurement showed that\nbesides the ~20-nm-thick film surface, the bulk of the film exhibited a fully\nstoichiometric composition of Mg and B. Finally, we note that our rapid annealing\nprocedure prevented any substrate degradation and is suitable for annealing of thin\nfilms prepared on various, unstable at high temperature substrates.\n\u0019\n\n\fThe authors thank E.
