I NTRODUCTION\nThe canonical sheaf plays a crucial role in the classification of varieties of characteristic zero.\nGlobal sections of its powers define the canonical map, which is birational onto its image for\nvarieties of general type with mild singularities. The image is called the canonical model, and it is\na unique representative of the birational equivalence class of the original variety. In particular, the\ncanonical model can be used to construct a moduli space that classifies varieties of general type\nup to birational equivalence. This moduli space Mh of stable schemes, is the higher dimensional\ngeneralization of the intensely investigated space Mg of stable curves. In order to build Mh , it is\nimportant to understand when the canonical sheaf behaves functorially in families, that is, when it\nis compatible with base change.\nMore precisely, to obtain a compact moduli space, in Mh not only canonical models are allowed,\nbut also their generalizations, the semi-log canonical models [Kol10b, Definition 15]. By definition\nthese are projective schemes with semi-log canonical singularities [HK10, Definition 3.13.5] and\nample canonical bundles. The first naive definition of the moduli functor of stable schemes with\n1\n\n\f2\n\nZSOLT PATAKFALVI\n\nHilbert function h is then as follows. Here h : Z \u2192 Z is an arbitrary function.\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\nf is flat, proper, Xb\u0304 is a semi- \uf8fd,\n\uf8f2\n(1.0.a)\nMh (B) = \uf8f3f : X \u2192 B log canonical[m]model (\u2200b \u2208 B), \uf8fe\nh(m) = \u03c7(\u03c9Xb ) (\u2200m \u2208 Z, b \u2208 B)\n\u223c\n= over B\n\nAs usual, the naive definition works only in the naive cases but not in general. More precisely,\n(1.0.a) is insufficient to prove the existence of a projective coarse moduli space or a proper DeligneMumford stack structure on Mh (c.f., [Kol10b],[Kol08]). In general, (1.0.a) has to be complemented with:\n(1.0.b)\n\n[m]\n\n\u03c9X/B\n\nXb\n\n[m]\n\u223c\n= \u03c9Xb for every integer m and b \u2208 B.\n\nUsually (1.0.b) is referred to as Koll\u00e1r's condition (e.g. [HK04, page 238]). Note also that (1.0.b)\nis not necessary for reduced B, but it does add important extra restrictions when B is non-reduced.\nCurrently, it is not understood in every aspect why and how deeply this condition is needed. For\nexample it is not known if in characteristic zero it is equivalent or not to the other possible choice,\ncalled Viehweg's condition (see [Vie95, Assumption 8.30] or [HK04, page 238]):\n(1.0.c)\n\n[m]\n\nthere is an integer m such that \u03c9X/B is a line bundle.\n\nThe starting point of this article is the m = 1 case of (1.0.b), that is, the compatibility of the relative\ncanonical sheaf with base change. We will try to understand how restrictive this condition is on flat\nfamilies. The results will also yield statements about how Serre's Sn condition behaves in families\nand for the canonical sheaves of single schemes.\nRecently it has been proven in [KK10, Theorem 7.9.3], that the relative canonical sheaf of\nflat families of projective schemes (over C) with Du Bois fibers is compatible with base change.\nAccording to [KK10, Theorem 1.4] this pertains to families with semi-log canonical fibers as\nwell. Furthermore, compatibility holds whenever the fibers are Cohen-Macaulay [Con00, Theorem\n3.6.1] .\nIt is important to note at this point, that the m = 1 case of (1.0.b), behaves differently than\nthe rest. For m > 1 there are examples of families of normal surfaces for which (1.0.b) does not\nhold (c.f., [HK10, Section 14.A]). However, since normal surfaces are Cohen-Macaulay, condition\n(1.0.b) with m = 1 holds for every flat family of normal surfaces. Hence, any incompatibility can\nbe observed only in higher dimensions. Partly due to this fact, there has been a common misbelief,\nsometimes even stated in articles, that the relative canonical sheaf is compatible with base change\nfor flat families of normal varieties. The question if this compatibility holds indeed was asked\nabout the same time independently by J\u00e1nos Koll\u00e1r and the author.\nQ UESTION 1.1. [Koll\u00e1r] Is \u03c9X/B |Xb \u223c\n= \u03c9Xb for every flat family X \u2192 B of normal varieties?\nHere we construct examples showing that the answer is no. That is, there are flat families of\nnormal varieties over smooth curves such that the relative canonical sheaves are not compatible\nwith base change. The examples also show that the known results are optimal in many senses.\nThat is, the fibers of the given families can be chosen to be Sj for any n > j \u2265 2 and their relative\ncanonical sheaves to be Q-line bundles. The precise statement is as follows.\nTheorem 1.2 (= Corollary 6.6). For each n \u2265 3 and n > j \u2265 2 there is a flat family H \u2192 B\nof Sj (but not Sj+1 ), normal varieties of dimension n over some open set B \u2286 P1 , with \u03c9H /B a\n\n\fBASE CHANGE BEHAVIOR OF THE RELATIVE CANONICAL SHEAF\n\n3\n\nQ-line bundle, such that\n(1.2.a)\n\n\u03c9H /B\n\nH0\n\n\u223c\n6= \u03c9H0 ,\n\n(Here H0 is the central fiber of H .)\nMoreover, the general fiber of H can be chosen to be smooth and the central fiber to have only\none singular point.\nWhen j = n \u2212 1 and the general fiber is Cohen-Macaulay, somewhat surprisingly, the incompatibility of (1.2.a) always holds. Furthermore, one can allow Sn\u22121 points also in the general fibers\nprovided the relative Sn\u22121 locus has a components in the central fiber. The precise statement is as\nfollows. (See Section 2 for the assumptions of the article, e.g., scheme is always separated and of\nfinite type over k = k\u0304, etc.)\nTheorem 1.3 (= Theorem 7.1 ) . If f : H \u2192 B is a flat family of schemes of pure dimension n\nover a smooth curve, such that a component of the locus\n{x \u2208 H |x is closed, depth OHf (x) ,x = n \u2212 1}\nis contained in the special fiber H0 , then the restriction homomorphism \u03c9H /B |H0 \u2192 \u03c9H0 is not\nan isomorphism.\nIn particular, the contrapositive of Theorem 1.3 when the general fiber is Cohen-Macaulay yields\nthe following corollary.\nCorollary 1.4 (= Corollary 7.3) . If f : H \u2192 B is a flat family of schemes of pure dimension\nn such that \u03c9H /B is compatible with base change and the general fiber of f is Cohen-Macaulay,\nthen the central fiber of f cannot have a closed point x, such that depth OHf (x) ,x = n \u2212 1.\nCorollary 1.4 has many geometric consequences with respect to building moduli spaces with\nfunctorial relative canonical sheaves. For example, cone singularities over abelian surfaces can\nnot be smoothed over irreducible bases. It also generalizes some aspects of theorems by Koll\u00e1r\nand Kov\u00e1cs [KK10, Theorem 7.12] and Hassett [Has01, Theorem 1.1] stating that if all fibers\nare Du Bois schemes or log canonical surfaces and the general fiber is Sk or Cohen-Macaulay,\nrespectively, then so is the central fiber.\nInterestingly, the non-existence of a depth n \u2212 1 point is the strongest implication of the compatibility of the relative canonical sheaf with base change.\nProposition 1.5 (= Proposition 7.4). Corollary 1.4 is sharp in the sense that n \u2212 1 cannot be\nreplaced by i for any i < n \u2212 1.\nSummarizing, Corollary 1.4 and Proposition 1.5 state that in moduli spaces satisfying Koll\u00e1r's\ncondition, Sn\u22121 schemes do not appear in the irreducible components containing Cohen-Macaulay\nschemes. However, Sj schemes can possibly show up for some j < n \u2212 1.\nIf a scheme X is Cohen-Macaulay, which by definition means that OX is Cohen-Macaulay, then\n\u03c9X is Cohen-Macaulay as well [KM98, Corollary 5.70]. One would expect that if OX is only Sn\u22121 ,\nthen typically \u03c9X is also Sn\u22121 or at least it can be Sn\u22121 . Surprisingly the truth is quite the opposite.\nThe following application of Theorem 1.3 states that in certain cases an Sn\u22121 scheme cannot have\neven an S3 canonical sheaf.\nTheorem 1.6 (=Theorem 7.6). If X is an S3 , G2 scheme of pure dimension n, which has a closed\npoint with depth n \u2212 1, then \u03c9X is not S3 .\n\n\f4\n\nZSOLT PATAKFALVI\n\nThe most immediate consequences of Theorem 1.6 deal with compatibility of restriction to\nsubvarieties. For example, one can show that on a cone X over a Calabi-Yau threefold Y with\nh2 (OY ) 6= 0, for an effective, normal Cartier divisor D,\n\u03c9X (D)|D \u223c\n= \u03c9D \u21d4 D does not pass through the vertex.\nOr more generally, for an Sn\u22121 , normal variety X and an effective, normal Cartier divisor D,\n\u03c9X (D)|D \u223c\n= \u03c9D \u21d4 D does not pass through any closed point with depth n \u2212 1.\nTheorem 1.6 can also be related to log canonical centers. If (X, D) is a log canonical pair,\nD \u223cQ \u2212KX and \u03c9X is not S3 at x \u2208 X, then x is a log canonical center of the pair (X, D)\n[Kol10a, Theorem 3]. Hence by Theorem 1.6, if X is Sn\u22121 and (X, D) log canonical such that\nD \u223cQ \u2212KX , then (X, D) has a log-canonical center at all closed points with depth n \u2212 1. This\nstatement is of course obvious if we know that the depth n \u2212 1 closed points are already logcanonical centers of X. However, that is not always the case. For example, let X be the cone, with\nhigh enough polarization, over the product Y of a K3 surface with the projective line and let D be\nthe cone over an anti canonical divisor of Y . Then, (X, D) is log-canonical, X is Sn\u22121 and the\ncone point is the only closed point with depth n \u2212 1 (c.f., Lemma 4.3). Still, the vertex is not a\nlog-canonical center of X, because KX is not Q-Cartier.\nTheorem 1.6 raises the following question as well.\nQ UESTION 1.7. Is it true that if X is a pure n-dimensional scheme such that OX is Sl , but not\nSl+1 , and \u03c9X is Sj , but not Sj+1 , for some j, l < n, then j + l \u2264 n + 1?\nR EMARK 1.8. By the methods of Section 4, the answer to Question 1.7 is positive if X is a cone\nover a smooth projective variety.\nThere are a couple of intuitive reasons for the failure of compatibility in (1.2.a). First, compatibility holds for the relative dualizing complex if the base is smooth by Proposition 3.3.1. Hence\n\u2022\n\u03c9H /B is a non-functorial component, the \u2212n-th cohomology sheaf, of the functorial object \u03c9H\n/B .\nFor example, by the proof of Theorem 1.3, if the general fiber is Cohen-Macaulay and the central\nfiber is Sn\u22121 , the restriction homomorphism fits into an exact sequence as follows, with a non-zero\nterm on the right.\n(1.8.a)\n\n0\n/\n\n\u03c9H /B |Xb\n/\n\n\u03c9Hb\n/\n\n\u2022\nTor 1 (h\u2212(n\u22121) (\u03c9H\n/B ), OH0 )\n\n/\n\n0\n\nThis shows in a precise way, how the functoriality might be destroyed by passing to the lowest\n\u2022\ncohomology sheaf of \u03c9H\n/B .\nAnother explanation for the incompatibility (1.2.a) is that H0 is too singular. Using stable\nreduction one may find a replacement for H0 with the mildest possible singularities. The reduction\nsteps consist of blow-ups, finite surjective normalized base changes and contractions on the total\nspace of the family. The output is a family, the relative canonical sheaf of which is compatible\nwith base change by [KK10]. At the end of the article, we also present the stable reduction of our\nconstruction using a straight forward ad-hoc method. The algorithmic, and lengthy, method can be\nfound in the preprint version of the article.\nIn Section 3, we start with a short background overview on the base-change properties of relative\ndualizing complexes and relative canonical sheaves. The proofs of the main theorems can be found\nin Section 6 and Section 7. Some of these results are based on the existence of projective cones\n\n\fBASE CHANGE BEHAVIOR OF THE RELATIVE CANONICAL SHEAF\n\n5\n\nwith appropriately chosen singularities. In Section 4 we give a cohomological characterization of\nwhen certain sheaves on a cone are Sd . Then in Section 5 we use this characterization to give the\ndesired examples of projective cones. In Section 8 we compute the stable limit of our construction.\nAcknowledgements. The discussion contains ideas that originated from J\u00e1nos Koll\u00e1r and my advisor S\u00e1ndor Kov\u00e1cs.

N OTATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS\nUnless otherwise stated scheme means a separated scheme of finite type over a fixed field k of\ncharacteristic zero and every morphism is separated. A variety is an integral scheme. A projective\nor quasi-projective scheme means a projective or quasi-projective scheme over k. A curve is a\nquasi-projective, integral scheme of dimension one. If Y is a subscheme of X, then IY,X is the\nideal sheaf of Y in X. If IY,X is a line bundle (i.e. a locally free sheaf of rank one), then we\ndefine OX (\u2212Y ) := IY,X and OX (Y ) := OX (\u2212Y )\u22121 . Notice, that IY,X being a line bundle is\nequivalent, to Y being defined around every point P by a single non zero divisor element of OX,P .\nA hypersurface of a quasi-projective scheme X \u2286 PN is a subscheme H \u2286 X defined by a\nsection of OX (d) for some d > 0. If H and H \u2032 are hypersurfaces of a quasi-projective scheme\nX \u2286 PN , defined by f0 and f\u221e \u2208 H 0 (PN , OPN (d)), respectively, then the pencil generated by H\nand H \u2032 is the subscheme H \u2286 X \u00d7 P1 defined by the section f0 t0 + f\u221e t1 of H 0 (X \u00d7 P1 , O(d, 1)).\nHere t0 and t1 are the usual parameters of P1 , and f0 and f\u221e are viewed as elements of H 0 (X, OX (d))\nvia the natural homomorphism H 0 (PN , OPN (d)) \u2192 H 0 (X, OX (d)).\nFor a complex C \u2022 of sheaves, hi (C \u2022 ) is the i-th cohomology sheaf of C . For a morphism\n\u2022\nf : X \u2192 Y , \u03c9X/Y\n:= f ! OY , where f ! is the functor obtained in [Har66, Corollary VII.3.4.a]. If\n\u2022\nf has equidimensional fibers of dimension n, then \u03c9X/Y := h\u2212n (\u03c9X/Y\n). Every complex and morphism of complexes is considered in the derived category D(qc/ ) of quasi-coherent sheaves up to\nthe equivalences defined there. If Z is a closed subscheme of X, where \u03b9 : Z \u2192 X is the embedding morphism, then the map R\u03b9\u2217 \u223c\n= \u03b9\u2217 identifies D(qc/Z) with a full subcategory of D(qc/X).\nWe use this identification at multiple places, equating C \u2022 and R\u03b9\u2217 C \u2022 for every C \u2022 \u2208 D(qc/Z). If\nZ is a closed subscheme of a scheme X, then ( )|LZ denotes the derived restriction functor, which is\nnaturally isomorphic to \u2297L OZ via the above mentioned identification. A line bundle is a locally\nfree sheaf of rank one.\nIf X \u2192 B is a morphism of schemes, then Xb is the scheme theoretic fiber of X over B. If\na sheaf F on X is given, then Fb := F |Xb . The dimension dimX P of a point P \u2208 X is the\ndimension of its closure in X. The acronym slc stands for semi-log canonical ([HK10, Definition\n3.13.5]).\nThe depth of a coherent sheaf F at a point x \u2208 X is by definition the depth of Fx with respect\nto the maximal ideal mX,x at x and is denoted by depth Fx . The depth of a scheme X at x is\ndepth OX,x . A coherent sheaf F is Sd on X if for every x \u2208 X,\n(2.0.b)\n\ndepth Fx \u2265 min{d, dim OX,x }.\n\nNote, that there is an ambiguity in the literature about the definition of Sd sheaves. Many sources\nreplace OX,x in (2.0.b) by Fx , thus gaining a weaker notion. Since, every sheaf of this article\nhas full support, or equivalently every sheaf is considered over its support, the two definitions are\nequivalent for all cases considered here. Hence, we decided to include the stronger notion, but the\n\n\f6\n\nZSOLT PATAKFALVI\n\nreader should feel free to think about the other one as well. For a morphism f : X \u2192 B, F is\nrelative Sd if F |Xb is Sd for all b \u2208 B. The word (relative) Cohen-Macaulay is a synonym for\n(relative) Sdim X .\nA scheme X is Gr for some r \u2265 0 if it is Gorenstein in codimension r. A point P \u2208 X is\nan associated point of a coherent sheaf F if mX,P is the annihilator of some element of FP . An\nassociated component of a coherent sheaf is the closure of an associated point. One can show that\nif Q \u2208 X, FQ 6= 0 and P is the set of prime ideals of OX,Q corresponding to generalizations of\nQ that are associated points of F , then\n[\n\nP = {x \u2208 OX,Q |\u22030 6= m \u2208 FQ : xm = 0}\n\nP \u2208P\n\nConsequently, if s is a section of a line bundle, then it does not vanish on any associated component\nof X (i.e., of OX ) if and only if for every P \u2208 X, sP is not a zero divisor. That is, if H is the\nsubscheme of X cut out by s, then IH,X is a line bundle if and only if s does not vanish on any\nassociated component of X.\nFor an S2 , G1 scheme and an arbitrary coherent sheaf F , the n-th reflexive power is\nF\n\n[n]\n\n:=\n\n\u001a\n\n(F \u2297n )\u2217\u2217\n(F \u2297(\u2212n) )\u2217\n\nif n \u2265 0\nif n < 0.\n\nThat is, it is the reflexive hull of the n-th tensor power. A coherent sheaf F is a Q-line bundle, if\nF [n] is a line bundle for some n > 0. Note, that if f : X \u2192 B is a family with \u03c9Xb a Q-line bundle\nfor all b \u2208 B, then \u03c9X/B is not necessarily a Q-line bundle [HK10, Section 14.A]. However, if Xb\nare S2 , G1 schemes and \u03c9X/B a Q-line bundle then \u03c9Xb is a Q-line bundle for all b \u2208 B (c. f.\n[HK04, Lemma 2.6]).\n3. B ACKGROUND ON BASE CHANGE FOR DUALIZING COMPLEXES\nThis section contains a general overview on the base change properties of relative dualizing\ncomplexes and relative canonical sheaves. For experts, some of the statements might be well\nknown, still they are included here for completeness and easier reference. Readers more interested\nin geometric arguments and willing to accept the statements of this section without proofs should\nfeel free to skip to the next section.\n\u2022\nof a quasi-projective family f : X \u2192 B is\nRecall that the relative dualizing complex \u03c9X/B\n!\n!\ndefined as f OB . Here f is the functor constructed in [Har66, Corollary VII.3.4.a]. The following\ntechnical point should be noted here.\nR EMARK 3.1. There is also another definition of f ! in [Nee96] as the right adjoint of Rf\u2217 . The\ntwo definitions coincide for proper morphisms by [Har66, Theorem VII.3.3] and [Nee96, Section\n6]. However, not in general. For example, if X is smooth affine variety over B = Spec k and\nf is the structure map, then Hartshorne's definition of f ! OSpec k lives in cohomological degree\n\u2212 dim X while Neeman's in cohomological degree zero. See [LH09, Part I, Exercise 4.2.3.d] for\nmore details on the differences (Neeman's f ! is denoted f \u00d7 there). We use Hartshorne's definition\nin the present article.\n\n\fBASE CHANGE BEHAVIOR OF THE RELATIVE CANONICAL SHEAF\n\n7\n\nThe dualizing complex of a single scheme Y is \u03c9Y\u2022 := \u03c9Y\u2022 / Spec k . The following fact is needed\nin the proof of Proposition 3.3.11. It follows from the invariance of the length of maximal regular\nsequences ([BH93, Theorem 1.2.5]).\nFact 3.2. Let P be a point of a subscheme H of a scheme X such that (IH,X )P is a line bundle, d\nan integer, and F a coherent S1 sheaf with full support (i.e., supp F = X) on X. Then\n(1) depth FP \u2265 d \u21d4 depth(F |H )P \u2265 d \u2212 1 (here F |H is regarded as a sheaf on H, not on\nX),\n(2) depth FP \u2265 min{d, dim OX,P } \u21d4 depth(F |H )P \u2265 min{d \u2212 1, dim OH,P }.\nProposition 3.3. Given a flat family f : H \u2192 B of schemes of pure dimension n over a smooth\nbase, a point 0 \u2208 B and a single quasi-projective scheme X of pure dimension n,\n(1) there is an isomorphism\n(3.3.a)\n\u03c9 \u2022 |L \u223c\n= \u03c9\u2022 ,\nH /B H0\n\nH0\n\n(2) fixing any isomorphism in (3.3.a), yields natural homomorphism\n(3.3.b)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n(3.3.c)\n\n\u03c9H /B |H0 \u2192 \u03c9H0 ,\n\u2022\n\u223c \u2022\nif B is of pure dimension d with OB \u223c\n= \u03c9B , then \u03c9H\n/B = \u03c9H [\u2212d],\n\u2022\n|V ,\nif V \u2286 X is any open set, then \u03c9V\u2022 \u223c\n= \u03c9X\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u223c\nif U \u2286 H is any open set, then \u03c9U/B = \u03c9H\n/B |U ,\n\u2022\nif P \u2208 X is a point, then depthP OX = d if and only if hi (\u03c9X\n)P is zero for i > \u2212d\u2212dimX P\nand non-zero for i = \u2212d \u2212 dimX P ,\n\u2022\nif P \u2208 H is a point, then depthP OHf (P ) = d if and only if hi (\u03c9H\n/B )P is zero for\ni > \u2212d \u2212 dimHf (P ) P and non-zero for i = \u2212d \u2212 dimHf (P ) P ,\n\u03c9X is S2 ,\n\u03c9H /B is S2 ,\n\u2022\nif the fibers of f are Cohen-Macaulay then \u03c9H /B \u223c\n= \u03c9H\n/B and consequently (3.3.b) is an\nisomorphism,\nif H0 is S2 and G1 , then (3.3.b) is isomorphism if and only if\ndepth \u03c9H /B,P \u2265 min{3, dim OH ,P }, for every P \u2208 H0 .\nFurthermore if (3.3.c) is not satisfied then not only (3.3.b) is not an isomorphism, but\n\u03c9H /B |H0 \u223c\n6= \u03c9H0 .\n\nProof. First, we prove point (1). It will be an ad-hoc proof, since we have not found the exact\nstatement in the literature. The statements we found are either only for flat base change morphisms\n[Har66, Corollary VII.3.4.a] or for proper f [LH09, Part I, Corollary 4.4.3]. Note, that however,\nit might seem that point (1) follows from base change for proper f , to the best knowledge of the\nauthor, it is not clear whether one can compactify a flat morphism to a flat morphism.\n\u2022\nFirst, by [Har66, Corollary VII.3.4.a], \u03c9H\n/B is compatible with flat base change. So, since\nd\nSpec O\nB,0 is flat over B, we may assume that B is the spectrum of a complete local ring of a\nsmooth scheme and 0 is the unique closed point. In particular, then B \u223c\n= Spec k[[x1 , . . . , xm ]].\nHence, by induction on m, it is enough to prove that\n(3.3.d)\n\u03c9 \u2022 |Y \u223c\n= \u03c9\u2022 ,\nH /B\n\nY /C\n\n\f8\n\nZSOLT PATAKFALVI\n\nwhere C := Spec k[[x1 , . . . , xm\u22121 ]] and Y := H \u00d7B C.

Using point (4) again we may\nalso assume that it is projective. Then [KM98, Corollary 5.69] concludes the proof of point (8).\nPoint (9) is a consequence of point (8) and point (3). Point (10) is shown in [Con00, Theorem\n3.5.1].\nTo prove point (11), notice that by point (8), \u03c9H0 is S2 . Also since H0 is G1 , using point (10), the\nhomomorphism \u03c9H /B |H0 \u2192 \u03c9H0 is isomorphism in codimension one. Then by [Har94, Theorem\n1.9 and Theorem 1.12], using that H0 is S2 and G1 , \u03c9H /B |H0 \u2192 \u03c9H0 is isomorphism if and only\nif \u03c9H /B |H0 is S2 . Finally, by Fact 3.2.2, this is equivalent to (3.3.c).\nNotice that if (3.3.c) is not satisfied, then \u03c9H /B |H0 is not S2 over H0 . Hence in this case\nnot only (3.3.b) can not be isomorphism, but any isomorphism between \u03c9H /B |H0 and \u03c9H0 is\nimpossible.\n\u0003\n\n\f10\n\nZSOLT PATAKFALVI\n\nR EMARK 3.4. A priori, saying that (3.3.b) is an isomorphism is a stronger statement than that\n\u03c9H /B |H0 is isomorphic to \u03c9H0 . However, if B is smooth, H0 is projective, S2 and G1 , they are\nequivalent by the following argument. In this case \u03c9H0 is S2 and is a line bundle over the Gorenstein locus U. Assume that \u03c9H /B |H0 \u223c\n= \u03c9H0 via an arbitrary isomorphism \u03b1. Then \u03c9H /B |H0 is\nalso S2 and a line bundle over U. Since both are S2 , homomorphisms \u03c9H /B |H0 \u2192 \u03c9H0 are determined in codimension one, e.g., over U. Furthermore, any two isomorphism over U between any\ntwo line bundles differ by multiplication with an element of H 0(U, OH0 ), where H 0 (U, OH0 ) \u223c\n= k\u2217,\nby H0 being S2 and projective. Since the restriction of the natural morphism \u03b2 : \u03c9H /B |H0 \u2192 \u03c9H0\nover U is an isomorphism, \u03b1 differs from \u03b2 over U by a multiplication with an element of k \u2217 .\nHowever, then the same is true over entire X, by the codimension one determination. Hence \u03b2 is\nalso an isomorphism.\nFinally, we conclude with a statement about restriction behavior of relative dualizing complexes\nand relative canonical sheaves to hypersurfaces. For that we also need a lemma about flatness of\nhypersurfaces.\nLemma 3.5. If f : X \u2192 B is a flat morphism onto a smooth curve and H \u2286 X is a subscheme\nfor which IH ,X is a line bundle, then the following are equivalent\n\n(1) IHb ,Xb is a line bundle for every b \u2208 B, and\n(2) H is flat over B.\n\nIn particular, if f : X \u2192 B is flat with fibers of pure dimension n and H \u2286 X is also flat with\nIH ,X a line bundle, then fibers of H are of pure dimension n \u2212 1.\n\nProof. We prove only the equivalence statement, since the addendum follows from IHb ,Xb being\nline bundles.\nThe statement is local on H . So, fix P \u2208 H and let Q := f (P ). By [Har77, Proposition\n9.1A.a], H (resp. X ) is flat over B at P if and only if the homomorphisms OH ,P \u2192 OH ,P (resp.\nOX ,P \u2192 OX ,P ) induced by multiplication with some power of the local parameter t of OB,Q is\ninjective. Furthermore, by induction this is equivalent to the injectivity of multiplication with the\nfirst power t.\n\n\fBASE CHANGE BEHAVIOR OF THE RELATIVE CANONICAL SHEAF\n\n11\n\nThe assumptions of the lemma state that (IH ,X )P \u2286 OX ,P is generated by a non-zero divisor\nelement s.

S ERRE ' S CONDITION ON PROJECTIVE CONES\nIn this section we consider sheaves on projective cones that are isomorphic to pullbacks from\nthe base outside the vertex. Lemma 4.3 gives a cohomological description of when such sheaves\nare Sd . Before that we also need a short lemma, Lemma 4.2, about how the property Sd pulls back\nin flat relatively Cohen-Macaulay families.\nWe cite the following fact separately here, because it is used at many places throughout the\narticle, including the aforementioned Lemma 4.2.\nFact 4.1. [Gro65, Proposition 6.3.1] Let X and Y be two noetherian schemes, f : X \u2192 Y a flat\nmorphism, P \u2208 X arbitrary and F a coherent Y module.

C ONSTRUCTION OF VARIETIES WITH PRESCRIBED SINGULARITIES\nIn this section, normal Sj (but not Sj+1 ) varieties of dimension n \u2265 3 with Sl (but not Sl+1 ),\nQ-line bundle canonical sheaves are constructed for certain values of j and l. They are going to be\nused in Section 6 and in Section 7 to build families with prescribed base change behavior for the\nrelative canonical sheaves. First we need some lemmas.\nLemma 5.1. If H is a general, high enough degree hypersurface in a projective variety X, then\nH i (H, OH ) \u223c\n= H i (X, OX ) for every 0 < i < dim H.\nProof. We start with the usual exact sequence\n(5.1.a)\n\n0\n/\n\nOX (\u2212H)\n/\n\nOX\n/\n\nOH\n/\n\n0.\n\nSince deg H \u226b 0,\n(5.1.b)\n\nH i (X, OX (\u2212H)) = 0 whenever i < dim X.\n\nTaking the cohomology long exact sequence of (5.1.a) and using (5.1.b) finishes the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\nIterated use of Lemma 5.1 yields the following\nLemma 5.2. If H is a general, high enough degree complete intersection (i.e. it is the intersection\nof hypersurfaces, all of which are high enough degree) in a smooth projective variety X, then\nH i (H, OH ) \u223c\n= H i (X, OX ) for every 0 < i < dim H.\nFinally, iterated use of the adjunction formula yields the following.\nLemma 5.3. If H is a complete intersection in a smooth projective variety X, then \u03c9H \u223c\n= \u03c9X (m)|H\nfor some m > 0 (here OX (1) is the very ample line bundle given by the projective embedding of\nX).\nProposition 5.4. For each n \u2265 2 and 2 \u2264 d, l \u2264 n such that l \u2264 d and d + l \u2264 n + 2 there is an\nn + 1-dimensional projective variety Xn+1 for which:\n\u2022 Xn+1 is the projective cone over a smooth projective variety Yn with vertex P ,\n\n\fBASE CHANGE BEHAVIOR OF THE RELATIVE CANONICAL SHEAF\n\n15\n\n\u2022 Xn+1 is Sd and depth OXn+1 ,P = d,\n\u2022 \u03c9Xn+1 is Sl and depth \u03c9Xn+1 ,P = l,\n\u2022 \u03c9Xn+1 is a Q-line bundle.\nProof. Take first two Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces Z and W of dimension d \u2212 1 and n + 1 \u2212 l,\nrespectively. Let Y := Yn be a general high enough degree complete intersection of codimension\nd \u2212 l in Z \u00d7 W . Notice, that d \u2212 l \u2265 0 by assumption. Finally, let Xn+1 be the projective cone\nover Y polarized by OY (1) := OZ\u00d7W (p)|Y for some p \u226b 0 (after fixing Y ). Here OZ\u00d7W (1) is the\nvery ample line bundle on Z \u00d7 W coming from its projective embedding.\nThe K\u00fcnneth isomorphism yields the following.\nH (Z \u00d7 W, OZ\u00d7W ) \u223c\n=\nq\n\nq\nM\n\nH r (Z, OZ ) \u2297 H q\u2212r (W, OW ).\n\nr=0\n\nSince Z and W are Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces of dimension d \u2212 1 and n + 1 \u2212 l, respectively, the\nfollowing holds for their cohomology table.\nH q (Z, OZ ) 6= 0 \u21d4 q = 0 or d \u2212 1\nH s (W, OW ) 6= 0 \u21d4 s = 0 or n + 1 \u2212 l.\nHence\nH q (Z \u00d7 E, OZ\u00d7E ) 6= 0 \u21d4 q = 0, d \u2212 1, n + 1 \u2212 l or n \u2212 l + d.\nUsing Lemma 5.2 yields\n(5.4.a)\n\nfor 0 < q < n :\n\nH q (Y, OY ) 6= 0 \u21d4 q = d \u2212 1 or n + 1 \u2212 l.\n\nSince p \u226b 0, also:\nH q (Y, OY (r)) = 0 for every r and 0 < q < n.\nThen by Lemma 4.3 using that d\u22121 \u2264 n+1\u2212l by assumption, Xn+1 is Sd and depth OXn+1 ,P = d\n(Xn+1 is S2 at the vertex, because p \u226b 0 and hence Y is projectively normal).\nSerre duality implies that\nH q (Y, \u03c9Y ) \u223c\n= (H n\u2212q (Y, OY ))\u2217 .\nSo, by (5.4.a),\nfor 0 < q < n :\n\nH q (Y, \u03c9Y ) 6= 0 \u21d4 q = l \u2212 1 or n + 1 \u2212 d.\n\nSince Xn+1 is an affine bundle over Y , \u03c9Xn+1 is isomorphic to the pullback of \u03c9Y outside of the\nvertex. Then by Lemma 4.3 using that l \u2212 1 \u2264 n + 1 \u2212 d, \u03c9Xn+1 is Sl and depth \u03c9Xn+1 ,P = l\n(\u03c9Xn+1 is always S2 by Proposition 3.3.8).\nWe are left to show, that \u03c9Xn+1 is Q-Cartier. By Lemma 5.3,\n\u03c9Y\u2297p \u223c\n= (\u03c9Z\u00d7E (m)|Y )\u2297p \u223c\n= (OZ\u00d7E (m)|Y )\u2297p \u223c\n= OY (m).\nThat is, \u03c9Y\u2297p is an integer multiple of the polarization of Y used at the construction of Xn+1 . Hence,\n[HK10, Exercise 3.5] concludes the proof.\n\u0003\n\n\f16\n\nZSOLT PATAKFALVI\n\n6. C ONSTRUCTION OF FAMILIES WITHOUT THE BASE CHANGE PROPERTY\nIn this section we present the proof of Theorem 1.2. The following lemma contains the key\nargument of Theorem 1.2. It is also used in the proofs of Proposition 1.5 and Theorem 1.6.\nLemma 6.1. Let f : H \u2192 B = P1 be a flat pencil of hypersurfaces of a quasi-projective,\nequidimensional scheme X, such that IH ,X\u00d7B is a line bundle and H and the closed fibers of f\nare S2 and G1 . Then\n(1) if \u03c9X is S3 , the restriction map \u03c9H /B |H0 \u2192 \u03c9H0 is an isomorphism,\n(2) if depth \u03c9X,P 6\u2265 min{3, dim OX,P } for some P \u2208 X, such that P \u2208 H0 , but P 6\u2208 H\u221e ,\nthen \u03c9H /B |H0 \u223c\n6= \u03c9H0 .\nProof. Notice that by flatness of H and by Lemma 3.5, it does make sense to talk about \u03c9H /B .\nDefine X := X \u00d7 B. Then H is a hypersurface of X . By Proposition 3.6.2 there is a homomorphism \u03c9X /B (H )|H \u2192 \u03c9H /B , which is isomorphism in codimension one, over the Gorenstein\nlocus of H . Fix this homomorphism for the course of the proof.\nNow, we show point (1). If \u03c9X is S3 , then so is \u03c9X /B \u223c\n= p\u22171 \u03c9X by Lemma 4.2. Hence, by Fact\n3.2.2, \u03c9X /B (H )|H is S2 . Then, since \u03c9H /B is S2 by Proposition 3.3.9, \u03c9X /B (H )|H \u2192 \u03c9H /B\nis isomorphism everywhere by [Har94, Theorem 1.9 and Theorem 1.12].

This is the set of\npoints, the first coordinates of which are not contained in every element of the pencil H \u2192 B. By\nProposition 3.3.4 and 3.3.5, we may replace X by U, or with other words, X by X \\ (H0 \u2229 H\u221e ).\nIn particular, then H0 \u2229 H\u221e = \u2205 and P is an arbitrary point of H0 , such that\n(6.1.b)\n\ndepth \u03c9X,P 6\u2265 min{3, dim OX,P }.\n\nThen all fibers of the projection p1 |H : H \u2192 X have dimension zero.

The condition IH ,X being a line bundle in Lemma 6.1 might look superfluous\nfor the first sight, since H is a hypersurface in X . However, according to Section 2, the latter\nonly means that H is the zero locus of some special section of a line bundle. That is, H or Hb\nfor some b \u2208 B could contain an entire irreducible component of X or Xb , respectively. Then\nProposition 3.6 would not apply. Such situations should definitely be avoided.\nThe following is the main construction to which Lemma 6.1 is applied in this section.\nC ONSTRUCTION 6.3. Consider a projective cone X over a variety Y . Let P be the vertex of X.\nTake two hypersurfaces in X. The first one H is a projective cone over a degree d generic hypere is a general degree d hypersurface of X. Denote by H \u2192 B\nsurface D of Y . The second one H\ne (for which H = H0 and H\ne = H\u221e ). Throughout the paper we\nthe pencil generated by H and H\nallow ourselves to replace this family by its restriction to a small enough open neighborhood of\n0 \u2208 B. Furthermore, when we compute stable reduction in Section 8, we will assume that d \u226b 0.\nLemma 6.4. In the situation of Construction 6.3, if X is S3 and Y is R1 , then\n(1) H and the closed fibers of f are normal varieties,\n(2) IH ,X\u00d7B is a line bundle,\n(3) f is flat.\nProof. We use the notation X := X \u00d7 B. Since Y is a variety (i.e., integral), so are D, X, X , H0\nand H\u221e . By the definition of a pencil H is defined by a single non-zero equation locally on X .\nSo, since X is integral, point (2) follows. Similarly, also Hb for every b \u2208 B is defined locally\nby a single non-zero equation locally. Hence by integrality of X, IHb ,Xb is also a line bundle for\nevery b \u2208 B. Thus, Lemma 3.5 yields point (3).\nTo prove point (1), note that X is S3 by Lemma 4.2 and by the assumption of the lemma. So,\nby Fact 3.2, H and the closed fibers of H are S2 (Remember, in Construction 6.3 we allowed\nourselves to shrink B around 0 \u2208 B). Since D is general and Y is R1 , D is R1 as well by Bertini's\ntheorem (c.f., [Har92, Theorem 17.16]). Therefore, so is H. Then, by possibly shrinking B, each\nclosed fiber of H is R1 . Thus all closed fibers of H , and H itself are normal.\n\u0003\nTheorem 6.5. In the situation of Construction 6.3, if dim X \u2265 3, X is S3 , Y is R1 , and depth \u03c9X,P = 2,\nthen\n(6.5.a)\n\n\u03c9H /B |H0 \u223c\n6= \u03c9H0 .\n\nIn addition:\n(1) if \u03c9X is a Q-line bundle, then \u03c9H /B is a Q-line bundle. In particular then \u03c9Hb is a Q-line\nbundle for all b \u2208 B,\n(2) if X is Sd and depth OX,P = d, then Hb is Sd\u22121 , for all b \u2208 B, and depth OH0 ,P = d \u2212 1.\n\n\f18\n\nZSOLT PATAKFALVI\n\nProof. By Lemma 6.4, we may apply Lemma 6.1.2, to obtain the main statement of the theorem.\nTo prove addendum (1), note that the normality of H and Hb for every b \u2208 B, [Har94, Theorem\n1.12] and Proposition 3.6 imply that\n(6.5.b)\n\n[n]\n[n]\n\u03c9Hb \u223c\n= (\u03c9X /B (H )|H )[n]\n= (\u03c9Xb (Hb )|Hb )[n] for any b \u2208 B, and \u03c9H /B \u223c\n\nfor all n \u2208 Z. Hence if \u03c9X is a Q-line bundle, then (6.5.b) implies that so is \u03c9H /B and \u03c9Hb for all\nb \u2208 B. To prove (2) we use Fact 3.2 once again.\n\u0003\nCorollary 6.6 (= Theorem 1.2) . For each n \u2265 3 and n > j \u2265 2 there is a flat family H \u2192 B\nof Sj (but not Sj+1 ), normal varieties of dimension n over some open set B \u2286 P1 , with \u03c9H /B a\nQ-line bundle, such that\n\u03c9H /B H0 6\u223c\n= \u03c9H0 .\nMoreover, the general fiber of H can be chosen to be smooth and the central fiber to have only\none singular point.\nProof. It follows by combining Proposition 5.4 (setting d = j + 1 and l = 2), Construction 6.3 and\nTheorem 6.5.\n\u0003\n7. D EGENERATIONS AND S ERRE ' S CONDITION\nWe turn to proving the statements relating Serre's condition Sd to degenerations of flat families.\nThe first half of the section is devoted to the following statement.\nTheorem 7.1 (= Theorem 1.3) . If f : H \u2192 B is a flat family of schemes of pure dimension n\nover a smooth curve, such that a component of the locus\n(7.1.a)\n\n{x \u2208 H |x is closed, depth OHf (x) ,x = n \u2212 1}\n\nis contained in the special fiber H0 , then the restriction homomorphism \u03c9H /B |H0 \u2192 \u03c9H0 is not\nan isomorphism.\nR EMARK 7.2. By the restriction homomorphism \u03c9H /B \u2192 \u03c9H0 we mean any homomorphism\nobtained as in Proposition 3.3.2.\nTheorem 7.1 might look technical, but it applies for example to the special case, when the\ngeneral fiber is Cohen-Macaulay and the central fiber contains at least one closed point with depth\nn \u2212 1. This yields the following corollary.\nCorollary 7.3 (= Corollary 1.4) . If f : H \u2192 B is a flat family of schemes of pure dimension\nn such that \u03c9H /B is compatible with base change and the general fiber of f is Cohen-Macaulay,\nthen the central fiber of f cannot have a closed point x, such that depth OHf (x) ,x = n \u2212 1.\nProposition 7.4 (= Proposition 1.5) . Corollary 7.3 is sharp in the sense that n \u2212 1 cannot be\nreplaced with i for any 2 \u2264 i < n \u2212 1.\nProof. Fix a 2 \u2264 i < n \u2212 1. Consider the projective cone X given by Proposition 5.4, setting\nd = i + 1 and l = 3. Use then Construction 6.3 for X. By Lemma 6.4, this yields a flat family\nf : H \u2192 B of normal varieties for which Lemma 6.1.1 applies. That is, the restriction homomorphisms \u03c9H /B |Hb \u2192 \u03c9Hb are isomorphisms for every b \u2208 B. Finally, since X is Cohen-Macaulay\noutside of P and depth OX,P = i + 1, by Fact 3.2, Hb is Cohen-Macaulay outside of P , where\ndepth OH0 ,P = i.\n\u0003\n\n\fBASE CHANGE BEHAVIOR OF THE RELATIVE CANONICAL SHEAF\n\n19\n\nWe also need the following lemma in the proof of Theorem 7.1.\nLemma 7.5. If f : H \u2192 B is a flat morphism of schemes onto a smooth curve, F is a coherent\nOH -module on H and P \u2208 H0 , then\n(1) Tor 1H (F , OH0 )P 6= 0 if and only if F has an associated component W such that P \u2208 W \u2286 H0 ,\n(2) Tor iH (F , OH0 ) = 0 for i > 1.\nProof. By restricting B, we may assume that I0,B \u223c\n= OB . Denote by s a generator of I0,B and\nconsider the following exact sequence.\n(7.5.a)\n\n0\n/\n\n*s\n\nOH\n\n/\n\nOH\n/\n\nOH0\n/\n\n0\n\nThen the long exact sequence of Tor \u2022H (F , ) applied to (7.5.a) yields\n\nTor 1H (F , OH ) = 0\n/\n\nTor 1H (F , OH0 )\n/\n\n*s\n\nF\n\n/\n\nF.\n\nHence Tor 1H (F , OH0 )P 6= 0 if and only if s annihilates something in FP , if and only if F has an\nassociated component W such that P \u2208 W \u2286 H0 .\nAnother part of the long exact sequence of Tor \u2022H (F , ) applied to (7.5.a) yields the following\nfor i > 1.\n\nTor iH (F , OH ) = 0\n/\n\nTor iH (F , OH0 )\n/\n\nTor i\u22121\nH (F , OH ) = 0\n\nHence, Tor iH (F , OH0 ) = 0 indeed if i > 1.\n\n\u0003\n\nProof of Theorem 7.1. Fix a closed point x \u2208 H0 with depth OH0 ,x = n \u2212 1, contained in a\n\u2022\ncomponent W \u2286 H0 of the locus (7.1.a). Notice that the locus (7.1.a) is supp(h\u2212(n\u22121) (\u03c9H\n/B )) by\n\u2212(n\u22121)\n\u2022\nProposition 3.3.7, and hence W is also an associated component of h\n(\u03c9X/B ). Consider an\nopen neighborhood of x, where every closed point has depth at least n \u2212 1. Replacing H by this\nneighborhood all assumptions of the theorem stay valid, and moreover we may assume that every\nclosed point of H has depth at least n \u2212 1. In particular, then\n(7.5.b)\n\n\u2022\nhi (\u03c9H\n/B ) 6= 0 \u21d4 i = \u2212n or \u2212 (n \u2212 1).\n\n\u2022\nDefine E := h\u2212(n\u22121) (\u03c9H\n/B ).

See Section 1 for motivation on Theorem 7.6.\nTheorem 7.6 (=Theorem 1.6). If X is an S3 , G2 scheme of pure dimension n, which has a closed\npoint with depth n \u2212 1, then \u03c9X is not S3 .\nProof. Since the statement of the theorem is local, we may assume X is affine and hence quasiprojective. Restricting to a sufficiently small neighborhood of a point with depth n \u2212 1, all assumptions of the theorem stay valid and we may assume S\nthat all closed points of X have depth at least\nn \u2212 1. We use the notation X := X \u00d7 B. Let X = ri=1 Xi be the decomposition into irreducible\ncomponents.\nConsider a pencil f : H \u2192 B = P1 of hypersurfaces of X such that\n(1) H0 contains the entire non Gorenstein locus,\n(2) \u2205 =\n6 H0 \u2229 Xj 6= Xj for every 1 \u2264 j \u2264 r,\n(3) H\u221e is a general hypersurface.\nIn particular then,\n(7.6.a)\n\n(H0 \\ H\u221e ) \u2229 Xj 6= \u2205\n\nfor every\n\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 r.\n\nBy definition of the pencil, if P \u2208 H0 \\ H\u221e , then P \u2208\n/ Hb for any b 6= 0. Hence assumption (2)\nand (7.6.a) imply that for all b \u2208 B, there is a point of Xj not contained in Hb . Note now, that\nsince X is S1 , by Lemma 4.2, so is X . In particular, then all associated points of X and X are\ngeneral points of components. So, since none of Hb contains any of the Xj , IH ,X and IHb ,Xb\nfor every b \u2208 B have non-zero divisor local generators and hence are line bundles. Then H is flat\nover B by Lemma 3.5.\nDefine the following loci\nZ := {x \u2208 X|x is closed, depth OX,x = n \u2212 1}\nW := {x \u2208 X|x is closed, depth OHf (x) ,x = n \u2212 2}\nBy construction and by Fact 3.2, W0 = Z and W = (p\u22121 Z)red , where p : H \u2192 X is the natural\nprojection. Let Z \u2032 be an irreducible component of Z of the highest dimension. By the choice of\nH0 and H\u221e , Z \u2032 \u2286 H0 , and Z \u2032 6\u2286 H\u221e . Furthermore, H\u221e does not contain any of the irreducible\ncomponents of Z. Hence, the general fiber of the map W \u2192 B will have dimension at most\ndim Z \u2032 \u2212 1. So, W has dimension dim Z \u2032 . Hence, Z \u2032 \u2286 W0 is an irreducible component of W . In\nparticular, by Theorem (7.1), the restriction morphism \u03c9H /B |H0 \u2192 \u03c9H0 is not an isomorphism.\n\n\fBASE CHANGE BEHAVIOR OF THE RELATIVE CANONICAL SHEAF\n\n21\n\nOn the other hand assume that \u03c9X is S3 . Since X is G2 , H and Hb for every b \u2208 B are G1 . In\nfact, H , and Hb for a general b \u2208 B are G2 also, but for H0 only G1 can be guaranteed. Also, X\nis S3 by assumption and X is S3 because of Lemma 4.2. Then H and Hb for every b \u2208 B are S2\nby Fact 3.2. That is, we may apply Lemma 6.1.1, which states that the restriction homomorphism\n\u03c9H /B |H0 \u2192 \u03c9H0 is an isomorphism. This is a contradiction, hence \u03c9X cannot be S3 .\n\u0003\n8. S TABLE REDUCTION\nIn Construction 6.3, although the general fiber of H \u2192 B has mild, i.e., log canonical, singularities, H0 is very singular. The failure of base change for \u03c9H /B implies that by [KK10, Theorem\n7.9] H0 is not Du Bois. By [KK10, Theorem 1.4], it is also not log canonical. In this section,\ne\nwe compute the stable limit of H \u2192 B. It is the limit at 0 of some stable family H \u2032 \u2192 B.\n\u2032\n\u223c\ne e\nfor a finite cover\nThis family has two important properties. First, H \u00d7B B|\n= H |e\nB\\{0}\n\nB\\{0}\n\ne 0) \u2192 (B, 0) totally ramified at 0. Second, (H \u2032 )0 is log canonical, and hence by [KK10,\n\u03c6 : (B,\nTheorems 1.4 and 7.9], \u03c9H \u2032 /Be commutes with base change. So, (H \u2032 )0 is the \"right\" limit of H ,\nand the incompatibility of Theorem 1.2 can be thought of as a consequence of using the wrong\nlimit in Construction 6.3. '\nProposition 8.1. Assuming that Y is smooth, the stable limit of Construction 6.3 is the d-fold\ncyclic cover of Y ramified exactly over D, with eigen-line bundles OY (\u2212i) for i = 0, . . . , d \u2212 1.\n\nProof. First, shrink B if necessary so that \u221e \u2208\n/ B and that every fiber apart from H0 is log\ncanonical. Notice that this is possible because the general fiber of H is smooth by Bertini's\ntheorem. Also, since we assumed that d \u226b 0, the family H \u2192 B has canonically polarized fibers\nand hence is stable over B \u2217 := B \\ {0}. Define X := X \u00d7 B.\nThe closed embedding Y \u2286 PN \u22121 induces a natural closed embedding X \u2286 PN . This yields\nvery ample line bundles OPN (1) and OX (1). Then, H is the zero locus of a section f0 + tf\u221e of\nOX (d) := p\u22171 OX (d) for some f0 , f\u221e \u2208 H 0 (PN , OPN (d)), as explained in Section 2.\nChoose a basis z0 , . . . , zN of H 0 (PN , OPN (1)), such that z0 , . . . , zN \u22121 form a basis of H 0 (PN \u22121 , OPN\u22121 (1)).\nThen f0 and f\u221e correspond to degree d homogeneous polynomials in variables z0 , . . . , zN \u22121 and\nd\nz0 , . . . , zN , respectively. Furthermore, the fact that P \u2208\n/ H\u221e implies that the coefficient of zN\nin\nf\u221e is non-zero, say c.\ne 0) \u2192 (B, 0) be the degree d cyclic cover branched only at 0, where it is totally\nLet \u03c6 : (B,\ne at 0, such that sd = t.

So first, it is smooth by [KM98, Lemma 2.51]. Second, since (H \u2032 )0 is contained\nin the smooth part of X, \u03c9(H \u2032 )0 \u223c\n= \u03c9X (d)|(H \u2032 )0 by Proposition 3.6 and is a line bundle. So, since\n\u2032\nd \u226b 0, (H )0 is a canonically polarized manifold indeed.\nTo prove point (2), notice that the equation of H\u03c6 in X\u03c6 is\nf0 (z0 , . . . , zN \u22121 ) + sd f\u221e (z0 , . . . , zN \u22121 , zN ) \u2208 H 0 (X\u03c6 , OX\u03c6 (d))\ne\u2217 .\nHence, H\u03c6 |Be\u2217 \u223c\n= H \u2032 |Be\u2217 via the isomorphism induced by the following automorphism of PN \u00d7 B\n(z0 , . . . , zN +1 , zN ) 7\u2192 (z0 , . . . , zN \u22121 , szN )\n\nWe proved both points (1) and (2). Consequently, H \u2032 is a stable reduction of H indeed.\nThrough the course of the proof of point (1), we also proved that (H \u2032 )0 is indeed the cyclic\ncover described in the statement of the proposition.\n\u0003\n\n[BH93]\n[Con00]\n[Gro65]\n[HK10]\n[Har92]\n[Har66]\n\n[Har77]\n[Har94]\n\nR EFERENCES\nW.
