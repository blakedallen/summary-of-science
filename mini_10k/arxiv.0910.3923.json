The variant of exact solutions in the form of ordinary\n(without chronologization) operator exponents are proposed.\n\n1\n\nBasis of the method.\n\nThe starting point for solving differential equations by the operator method is\nlinear first-order differential equation for operator E = E(t):\n\u2202E\n= L(t)E\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\nE|t=a = I,\n\n(2)\n\nwith the initial condition\nwhere L(t) is a linear operator which, generally speaking, depends on t, but\n\u2202\ndoes not depend on operator \u2202t\nexplicitly; I is identity operator. The solution\nof this equation for t > a was obtained in 1949 by F. Dyson in the chronological\nexponential form [1] (see also [2], [3])\nZ t\nE(t) = T exp{\nd\u03c4 L(\u03c4 )},\n(3)\na\n\nwhere it is supposed, that exponent represents a power series expansion with\nfollowing chronologization according to the rule\nT {L(\u03c41 ) L(\u03c42 ) . . . L(\u03c4n )} =L(\u03c4\u03b11 ) L(\u03c4\u03b12 ) . . . L(\u03c4\u03b1n ).\n\u03c4\u03b11 \u2265 \u03c4\u03b12 \u2265 * * * \u2265 \u03c4\u03b1n\nVery important role plays the equation adjoint to (1) for operator E\u22121 =\nE (t) (see [4], [5])\n\u2202E\u22121\n= \u2212E\u22121 L(t)\n(4)\n\u2202t\n\u22121\n\n1\n\n\fwith the initial condition\nE\u22121 |t=a = I.\n\n(5)\n\nIt is easy to see using the Dyson's idea, that its solution is\nZ t\n\u22121\nE (t) = T0 exp{\u2212\nd\u03c4 L(\u03c4 )},\n\n(6)\n\na\n\nwhere operator T0 is the operator of opposed chronologization with action\nT0 {L(\u03c41 ) L(\u03c42 ) . . . L(\u03c4n )} = L(\u03c4\u03b11 ) L(\u03c4\u03b12 ) . . . L(\u03c4\u03b1n ).\n\u03c4\u03b11 \u2264 \u03c4\u03b12 \u2264 * * * \u2264 \u03c4\u03b1n\nIt appears that the operator E\u22121 (t) is inverse to the E(t), i.e.\nT0 exp{\u2212\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nd\u03c4 L(\u03c4 )} T exp{\n\na\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nd\u03c4 L(\u03c4 )} = I\n\na\n\nOrdering operators T and T0 for t < a change places. In some sense in linear\nproblems operators T and T0 provide description of direct and back scattering\naccordingly. It be assumed henceforth that t > a.\nOrdering (chronological) operators have to be introduced because the operators in the integrands with different values of the variable \u03c4 may not commute,\nwhat cause certain difficulties in manipulation with chronological exponents.\nNevertheless, examination of algebraical properties of the chronological exponents allows to obtain an extensive family of operator identities [4]-[6] which\nprovide possibilities of transformations and analysis of chronological expressions.\nThe operator \u2206 is derivative if\n\u2206(A + B)f = \u2206Af + \u2206Bf,\n\u2206Af = (\u2206A)f + A\u2206f\nfor any differentiable function f and any differentiable linear operators A and\nB. In other words, the linear operation is derivative if it satisfies to Leibnitz\nrule. As we will see later, the chronological operators with derivative operators\nin exponent, which we will denote for short as\nZ t\nd\u03c4 \u2206(\u03c4 )},\nE = T exp{\na\n\nplay the extremely important role here.\nLet b(t) be a function that is the operator of multiplication on the b(t). Then,\nas can be seen from the definition of the derivative operator, the commutator\n[b(t), \u2206(\u03c4 )] is a function too.\nNow consider the following construction\nK = E b(t) E\u22121 .\n2\n\n\fAs far as the commutator [b(t), \u2206(\u03c4 )] is a function, then all repeated commutators are functions too. So with help of BCH formula (see (27) in [6]) we conclude\nthat operator K is a function and\nK = (E b(t)),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the outward brackets in the right-hand side stress that action of operator\nis restricted by the brackets area. An analogous conclusion holds for E\u22121 b(t) E.\nLet us consider further the following obvious chain\nE b1 b2 . . . bn = E b1 E\u22121 E b2 E\u22121 . . . E bn =\n= (E b1 ) (E b2 ) . . . ( E bn ).\nWith what is observed here and the fact that the chronological operator is\nlinear, leads to conclusion that for any function F (b1 , b2 , . . . , bn ), which can\nbe expanded in power series with respect to b1 , b2 , . . . , bn , we can obtain the\nfollowing nice property:\nE F (b1 , b2 , . . . , bn ) = F ((E b1 ), (E b2 ), . . . , (E bn )).\n\n(8)\n\nAnalogously\nE\u22121 F (b1 , b2 , . . . , bn ) = F ((E\u22121 b1 ), (E\u22121 b2 ), . . . , (E\u22121 bn )).\n\n(9)\n\nThis property of the operator E coincides with familiar property of the\n\u2202\nshift operator exp{s \u2202b\n}, as shift operator is the particular case of chronological\nexponent.\nIt be assumed henceforth that Fi are analytic functions on all their arguments in corresponding regions.\n\n2\n\nChronological solutions of nonlinear differential equations.\n\nIn existent literature, devoted to operator approach for solving differential equations, as a rule, the linear problems are considered, i.e., one proceed from (1)(3). The connection of equations (1) and (4) with nonlinear ordinary differential\nequations seemingly for the first time was explicitly mentioned in [4], [5]. The\nsimilar attempt to nonlinear partial differential equations in [7] had not led to\ncompact form of solution, only infinite chronological iteration series was obtained there.\nLet us consider particular cases of the derivative operators \u2206 and differential\nequations, which correspond them.\n\n2.1\n\n\u2202\n.\n\u22061 (\u03c4 ) = F (\u03c4, c) \u2202c\n\nDifferentiating function\nu(t, c) = T0 exp{\u2212\n\nZ\n\na\n\n3\n\nt\n\nd\u03c4 F (\u03c4, c)\n\n\u2202\n}c\n\u2202c\n\n(10)\n\n\fon t, we obtain, taking into account (4) and then (9), that\n\u2202u\n= T0 exp{\u2212\n\u2202t\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nd\u03c4 F (\u03c4, c)\n\na\n\n\u2202\n}F (t, c) = \u2212F (t, u),\n\u2202c\n\ni.e, the expression (10) is a solution of ordinary differential equation of the first\norder for u = u(t, c) (see [4], [5], and also [6])\n\u2202u\n+ F (t, u) = 0,\n\u2202t\n\n(11)\n\nwhere c is an arbitrary constant, u|t=a = c. That is, the expression (10) is exact\ngeneral operator solution of the equation (11).\n\n2.2\n\n\u22062 (\u03c4 ) =\n\nPn\n\n\u2202\nj=1 Fj (\u03c4, c1 , . . . , cn ) \u2202cj .\n\nAnalogously, differentiating functions ui = ui (t, c1 , . . . , cn ), where i = 1, . . . , n,\nui = T0 exp{\u2212\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nd\u03c4\n\na\n\nn\nX\n\nFj (\u03c4, c1 , . . . , cn )\n\nj=1\n\n\u2202\n} ci\n\u2202cj\n\n(12)\n\non t, we ascertain that (12) (see [6]) is the solution of the following system of\nordinary differential equations of the first order for ui = ui (t, c1 , . . . , cn )\n\u2202ui\n+ Fi (t, u1 , . . . , un ) = 0,\n\u2202t\n\n(i = 1, . . . , n)\n\n(13)\n\nwhere ci are arbitrary constants, ui |t=a = ci .\n\n2.3\n\n\u22063 (\u03c4 ) =\n\nR\u221e\n\ndm \u03b6\n\u2212\u221e\n\nPn\n\n~ c, . . . , D \u03b1 ck , . . . ) \u03b4 ,\n\u03b6\n~\nj=1 Fj (\u03c4, \u03b6, ~\n\u03b4cj (\u03b6)\n\nwhere \u03c4 is dedicated independent variable (\"time\" variable), \u03b6~ = \u03b61 , . . . , \u03b6m are\n~ = c1 (\u03b6),\n~ . . . , cn (\u03b6)\n~ will be later on play\n\"space\" variables, the functions ~c = ~c(\u03b6)\nrole of arbitrary functions of \"space\" variables (it is clear, that it is supposed\nthat all these functions are arbitrary smooth and have not singularities), the\nsymbol . . . , D\u03b6\u03b1 ck , . . . denotes a set of all partial derivatives of ck (k = 1, . . . , n)\non \"space\" variables \u03b6i of the type\nD\u03b6\u03b1 ck =\n\n\u2202 \u03b11 . . . \u2202 \u03b1m ck\n\u03b1m\n\u2202\u03b61\u03b11 . . . \u2202\u03b6m\n\nup to some certain order, \u03b4c \u03b4(\u03b6)\n~ is the functional derivative.\nj\nDifferentiating on t functions\nZ t\nui (t, ~x) = T0 exp{\u2212\nd\u03c4 \u22063 } ci (~x) ,\na\n\n4\n\n(14)\n\n\fwhere ~x = x1 , . . . , xm , we obtain, taking into account (4) and then (9), that\nZ t\n\u2202ui\n= \u2212T0 exp{\u2212\nd\u03c4 \u22063 } \u25e6\n\u2202t\na\nZ \u221e\n~ ~c, . . . , D\u03b1 ck , . . . ) =\ndm \u03b6 \u03b4(\u03b6~ \u2212 ~x) Fi (t, \u03b6,\n\u03b6\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n= \u2212T0 exp{\u2212\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nd\u03c4 \u22063 } Fi (t, ~x, ~c, . . . , Dx\u03b1 ck , . . . ) =\n\na\n\n= \u2212Fi (t, ~x, ~u, . . . , Dx\u03b1 uk , . . . )\nand ascertain that (14) is the solution of system of partial differential equations\nof the first order on variable t (and arbitrary order on \"space\" variables) for\nui (t, ~x)\n\u2202ui\n+ Fi (t, ~x, ~u, . . . , Dx\u03b1 uk , . . . ) = 0,\n(i = 1, . . . , n)\n(15)\n\u2202t\nwhere ~u = u1 (t, ~x), . . . , un (t, ~x) and now in . . . , Dx\u03b1 uk , . . . appears the corresponding set of partial derivatives of uk (t, ~x) on \"space\" variables ~x.\ni\nFor equations of higher orders on t by substitutions of type \u2202u\n\u2202t = vi very\noften one can get over to system of the first order equations and, if it possible to\nresolve such system with respect to derivatives of unknown functions (including\nvi ) on t (i.e., reducing the equation or system into the so-called normal form),\nit is easy enough by using 2.2 or 2.3 to obtain operator solutions for these cases\ntoo.\nThe existence of formal solutions of nonlinear differential equations in the\nform of chronological operator exponents is important as a practical matter,\nfirst of all, because they represent in compact and clear form the dependence of\nsolutions from all parameters of the problem. If given differential equation fits\nthe conditions on existence and uniqueness of solutions, then all forms of exact\nsolutions are equivalent (with minor reservations) with each other. However, in\nusage of one or another form of solution one is wishing to have the opportunity\nto analyse it and certain freedom in its transformation in follow-on calculations.\nThe interpretation of chronological solutions as infinite series is the first, but\nfar from being an only opportunity. There are simple examples, when operator\nsolution can be transformed to the conventional form just by operator methods\n(see, e.g., [6]).\nFortunately for the stage of analytic (symbolic) calculations there is an extensive family of operator identities [4]-[6], which allow to carry out not only\nbasic algebraic operations with chronological exponents, but accomplish its differentiation on parameters and so on. If you wish, algebraic transformations here\ncan be interpreted as resummation of corresponding infinite iteration series in\nwhich compactness, visibility are kept and, what is important, opportunity to\nremain as soon as possible in terms of exact solutions.\nNevertheless on the stage of the decision-result (\"number\") obtaining very\noften it is necessary to turn to series. The presence of chronologization, which is\noverburdened by multiple integration, complicates considerably as calculations\n5\n\n\fas essential analysis of series convergence conditions. Therefore during more\nthan half a century the attempts to represent operator solutions in form of\nordinary (without chronological operator) exponent are made (see survey [8]),\nhere one of typical approaches is the so-called Magnus expansion. There are\nsome variants to solve this problem, which have its own benefits depending on\nposed a goal. As a rule such approaches lead to approximate presentation in\nthe form of very bulky expressions. The variant proposed below is differed by\nnoticeable simpleness and is, what is more, the exact solution.\n\n3\n\nThe solutions of nonlinear differential equations in form of ordinary (without chronological operator) exponent.\n\nIt is follows from operator identity (23) of [6] and well-known properties of shift\n\u2202\noperator that (note, operator L(t) does not depend on operator \u2202t\nexplicitly)\nexp{(t \u2212 a)\n\n= T exp{\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n} exp{(t \u2212 a)[L(s) \u2212\n]} =\n\u2202s\n\u2202s\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nd\u03c4 L(\u03c4 + s \u2212 a)} ,\n\na\n\nfrom here\nexp{(t \u2212 a)[L(s) \u2212\n\n\u2202\n]} =\n\u2202s\n\n\u2202\n= exp{\u2212(t \u2212 a) }T exp{\n\u2202s\n\n=T exp{\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nd\u03c4 L(\u03c4 + s \u2212 a)} =\n\na\n\nt\n\nd\u03c4 L(\u03c4 + s \u2212 t)} exp{\u2212(t \u2212 a)\n\na\n\n\u2202\n}.\n\u2202s\n\nor equivalent\n\u2202\n\u2202\n]} exp{(t \u2212 a) } =\n\u2202s\n\u2202s\nZ t\nd\u03c4 L(\u03c4 + s \u2212 t)} .\n= T exp{\n\nexp{(t \u2212 a)[L(s) \u2212\n\na\n\nSimilarly for inverse operators\n\n6\n\n\f\u2202\n\u2202\n]} exp{\u2212(t \u2212 a) } =\n\u2202s\n\u2202s\nZ t\n= T0 exp{\u2212\nd\u03c4 L(\u03c4 + s \u2212 a)} .\n\nexp{\u2212(t \u2212 a)[L(s) \u2212\n\n(16)\n\na\n\nLet us apply the obtained identities to the solutions of differential equations\nof Section 2. Note, first of all, that if both sides of identity (16) multiply from\nthe right on constant ck or function ck (~x), which do not depend on s, then the\naction of right shift operator in the left-hand side will be equal to the action of\nidentity operator I, while left-hand side operator under substitution s = a turns\ninto above examined operator (6).\nThus for\n\u2202\nL(\u03c4 ) = \u22061 (\u03c4 ) = F (\u03c4, c)\n\u2202c\nwe have, taking into account (16) and foregoing remarks, that\nZ\n\nt\n\n\u2202\n} c]|s=a =\n\u2202c\na\n\u2202\n\u2202\n]} c |s=a .\n= exp{\u2212(t \u2212 a)[F (s, c) \u2212\n\u2202c \u2202s\n\nu(t) = [T0 exp{\u2212\n\nd\u03c4 F (\u03c4 + s \u2212 a, c)\n\nAs a result we get the solution of equation (11) in exponential form (without\nchronological operator)\nu(t) = exp{\u2212(t \u2212 a)[F (s, c)\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212\n]} c |s=a .\n\u2202c \u2202s\n\nBy the same way one can obtain the exponential form of solution for system\nof ordinary differential equations (13)\nui (t) = exp{\u2212(t \u2212 a)[\n\nn\nX\n\nFj (\u03c4, c1 , . . . , cn )\n\nj=1\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212\n]} ci |s=a ,\n\u2202cj\n\u2202s\n\n(i = 1, . . . , n).\n\nSimilarly the exponential form of solution for system of partial differential\nequations (15) is as follows\nui (t, ~x) = exp{\u2212(t \u2212 a)[\u22063 (s) \u2212\n\n\u2202\n]} ci (~x) |s=a ,\n\u2202s\n\n(i = 1, . . . , n).\n\nIf expand the operator exponent into series, then one can obtain the expansion of the solution into Taylor series on powers of (t \u2212 a). This is most obvious\n(but not unique) interpretation of the operator exponential form of solutions.\nThe Maple procedures for analytical calculations of approximate solutions of\nordinary and partial differential equations (Cauchy problem), which are based\non the approach considered here, are presented in [9].\n\n7\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Dyson F J 1949 Phys.
