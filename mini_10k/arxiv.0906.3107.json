Starting with the Dolgachev surface E(1)2,3 we construct an infinite\nfamily of exotic copies of the rational surface E(1), each of which admits a handlebody\ndecomposition without 1- and 3- handles, and we draw these handlebodies.\n\n0. Introduction\nIt is an old problem to determine when an exotic copy of a smooth simply connected\n4-manifold admits a handle decomposition without 1- and 3- handles. Note that if\nan exotic S 4 or CP2 exists then its handle decomposition must contain either 1- or\n3-handles. Finding such exotic manifolds realizing the smallest Betti number is a particularly interesting problem. For example in [Y] and also [AY] exotic manifolds without\n1- and 3-handles were demonstrated. An interesting difficult case has been the Dolgachev\n2\nsurface E(1)2,3 , which is an exotic copy of E(1) = CP2 # 9CP . In [A1] a handlebody of\nthis manifold without 1- and 3-handles were drawn (previously this manifold was conjectured not to admit such a handlebody [HKK]). Here by extending the technique of [A1]\nwe construct infinitely many exotic copies of the rational surface E(1) without 1- and\n3-handles and draw their handlebodies.\nTheorem 1. There is an infinite family Xn , n = 1, 2, . . . of mutually non-diffeomorphic\nexotic copies of E(1) without 1- and 3-handles, such that X1 = E(1)2,3 (their handlebody\npictures are given in Figure 18).\nHere is a brief outline of this paper: A common technique to generate infinitely many\nexotic copies of a smooth 4-manifold X is the \"Knot surgery\" operation X \u2740 XK of\n[FS], where K \u2282 S 3 is a knot. Here the main goal is to make this operation compatible\nwith the handle cancelling techniques of [A1]. At first try this seems to be an impossible\ntask. The main difficulty with removing 1- and 3-handles from E(1)K is due to a certain twisting on its handles, which can only be seen after turning its handlebody upside\ndown. To understand this better, we first start with the test case of the handlebody of\nE(1)K1 = E(1)2,3 , where K1 is the trefoil knot, given in Figure 41 of [A1]. By turning\nthis handlebody upside down we get a nice symmetric picture of it in Figure 15 (recall,\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 58D27, 58A05, 57R65.\nThe author is partially supported by NSF grant DMS 0905917.\n\n22\n\n\fAn infinite family of exotic Dolgachev surfaces without 1- and 3- handles\n\nthe Figure 41 of [A1] was already obtained from an initial handlebody picture of E(1)K1\nby turning it upside down twice!). By inspecting the boundary of this handlebody in\nFigure 16 we locate the twisting among the attaching circles of its handles, and in return\nthis helps us to understand how this twist was compensated in the handles of E(1)K1\nso that no 1- and 3- handles are needed. Then by imitating this handle configuration in\nthe more general case in Figure 18, we can construct handlebodies for E(K)Kn so that\nno 1- and 3-handles are needed, where Kn , n = 1, 2, .. are knots with distinct Alexander\npolynomials (this implies these manifolds are mutually distinct).\n\n1. Construction\nWe start with the first picture of Figure 1 which is the handlebody of E(1)K1 given\nin Figure 41 of [A1]. By a handle slide we get the second picture of the Figure 1. Next\nwe turn this handlebody upside down. This is done by finding a diffeomorphism from\nthe boundary of this handlebody to \u2202B 4 and by attaching the dual 2-handles (the small\n0-framed blue linking circles in the first picture of Figure 2) to B 4 via this diffeomorphism.\nDuring this diffemorphism (e.g. sliding red handles over each other and blowing up and\ndown operations) no red handles can slide over the dual blue handles, but the blue handles\ncan slide over the red handles and they can slide over each other.\nNow we first replace a copy of S 1 \u00d7 B 3 , in the interior of the first picture of Figure 2,\nwith B 2 \u00d7S 2 (i.e. we replace the \"dotted\" circle with 0-framed circle), then blow down the\nsix \u22121 framed red circles to obtain the second picture of Figure 2 (this process increases\nthe framing of the newly introduced 0-framed circle to 6). Next by the indicated handle\nslides, isotopies and blowing downs we obtain Figures 3,4,5, . . . and finally the first picture\nof Figure 13. Then by canceling a pair of 1- and 2-handles from this picture we obtain\nthe second picture of Figure 13, and then by isotopies and the indicated handle slides\nwe get Figure 14, and then end up with the first picture of Figure 15, which is another\nhandlebody representation of E(1)K1 . A careful inspection shows that this handlebody\nhas no 1- and 3-handles. It has no 3-handles because its boundary is S 3 (this will be\nchecked in the next paragraph), and it has no 1-handles because this figure has eleven\n2-handles and one \"slice\" 1-handle (= two standard 1-handles plus one 2-handle), and two\n1-handles of the slice 1-handle are cancelled by the two 2-handles corresponding to two of\nthe small 1-framed linking circles (this is exactly the same canceling process performed\nin the first paragraph of the Section 3 of [A1]). Hence this handlebody can be considered\nas a handlebody consisting of just ten 2-handles.\nWe can now check the boundary of the the first picture of Figure 15 is S 3 as follows:\nFirst we replace the slice 1-handle with a 2-handle (i.e. replace dot with zero) and slide it\nover the two 1-framed two handles (corresponding to two trefoil knots) as indicated by the\narrows. This gives the first picture of Figure 16, then by further indicated handle slides\nin Figure 16 and cancellations we get S 3 . Note that this process creates a left twist to the\nhandlebody which undoes the right twist on the upper most 2- handle of the Figure 16.\n23\n\n\fAKBULUT\n\nHaving seen how the boundary of the first picture of Figure 15 is identified by S 3 ,\nwe can check that the 1-framed dotted green circle (denoted by \u03bb in the picture) on the\nboundary is just a 0-framed unknot. Hence we can add a 2-handle to \u03bb with 1-framing,\nand immediately after that cancel it with a 3-handle. Now by sliding over the handle \u03bb\nwe get the second picture of the Figure 15, which is another more symmetric handlebody\nrepresentation of E(1)K1 with eleven 2-handles and one 3-handle (after canceling the slice\n1-handle with 2-handles). The advantage of this picture is that, it can easily be identified\nas the manifold obtained by doing the \"knot surgery operation\" to the first picture in\nFigure 17 by using the algorithm of [A3] and [A4]. Also the reader can easily check that\nthe first picture of Figure 17 is just E(1).\nNow this knot surgery operation process E(1) \u2740 E(1)K1 can be imitated to construct\nE(1) \u2740 E(1)Kn with the sequence of knots Kn (drawn in the second picture of Figure 17) with the same conclusions; i.e. the first picture of Figure 18 is the knot surgered\nmanifold E(1)Kn , and the second picture of Figure 18 is a handlebody representation of\n\u0003\nthis manifold E(1)Kn without 1- and 3- handles. Let Xn = E(1)Kn .\nRemark 1. The Reader might wonder, why once we found the handlebody configuration\nof E(1) in Figure 17 we didn't shorten this paper by making it as the starting point of the\nproof (hence making the paper independent from [A1]). There are two reasons: First we\ndon't know if the cusp in Figure 17 is the cusp of the elliptic fibration of E(1) (even though\nit can be checked that as homology classes they coincide). Hence starting the proof with\nFigure 17 would give the conclusion of the Theorem 1 but not the identification of X1\nwith E1,2 . So the proof of the first part of the Theorem 1 is independent of [A1]. The\nsecond reason relating Theorem 1 to [A1] is that we wanted to set a dictionary between\nthe handles of E(1)Kn and E(1)2,3 , so in future we may be able to relate the corks in\nE(1)Kn with the cork of E(1)2,3 ([AY]). Recall that in [A1] it was shown that E(1)2,3 is\nobtained from E(1) by twisting along the certain cork W 1 \u2282 E(1). It is an interesting\nproblem to determine the cork structures of the rest of the manifolds Xn , n \u2208 Z.\nRemark 2. Notice that K\u22123 is a slice knot, i.e. K\u22123 = \u2202D02 for some disk D02 \u2282 B 4 . Hence\nK\u22123 # \u2212 K\u22123 bounds two slice disks in B 4 , one is D12 = D02 \u266e \u2212 D02 \u2282 B 4 , and the other\none is the usual slice disk D22 \u2282 B 4 induced from the imbedding K\u22123 \u00d7I \u2282 B 2 \u00d7B 2 = B 4 .\nRecall \"the slice 1-handle\" is B 4 \u2212D22 . It can be checked that we replace the slice 1-handle\nin Figure 18 by the other slice complement B 4 \u2212 D12 amazingly the resulting manifold\nsplits CP2 's, i.e. Xn changes its smooth structure. This is related to the phenomena\ndiscussed in [A5] (and also in [A4]): A knot in S 3 can bound two different ribbon disks\nin B 4 such that the two ribbon complements are exotic copies of each other relative to\ntheir boundaries (and they can be taken to be homotopy equivalent to S 1 ). The example\ngiven here may be viewed as the closed manifold version of this phenomenon.\n\n24\n\n\fAn infinite family of exotic Dolgachev surfaces without 1- and 3- handles\n\nReferences\n[A1]\n[A3]\n[A4]\n\nS.
