The continuum and emission Balmer line intensities varied more\nthan by a factor of two during 1992\u20132008. The lag between the continuum and H\u03b2\nemission line flux variations is 21.1 \u00b1 1.9 days. For the H\u03b1 line the lag is about 27 days\nbut its uncertainty is much larger. We use Monte-Carlo simulation of the random time\nseries to check the effect of our data sampling on the lag uncertainties and we compare\nour simulation results with those obtained by random subset selection (RSS) method\nof Peterson et al. (1998). The lag in the high-velocity wings are shorter than in the\nline core in accordance with the virial motions. However, the lag is slightly larger in\nthe blue wing than in the red wing. This is a signature of the infall gas motion. Probably the BLR kinematic in the Mrk 6 nucleus is a combination of the Keplerian and\ninfall motions. The velocity-delay dependence is similar for individual observational\nseasons. The measurements of the H\u03b2 line width in combination with the reverberation lag permits us to determine the black hole mass, MBH = (1.8 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 108 M\u2299 .\nThis result is consistent with the AGN scaling relationships between the BLR radius\nand the optical continuum luminosity (RBLR \u221d L0.5 ) as well as with the black-hole\nmass\u2013luminosity relationship (MBH \u2212 L) under the Eddington luminosity ratio for\nMrk 6 to be Lbol /LEdd \u223c 0.01.\nKey words: galaxies: active \u2013 galaxies: nuclei \u2013 galaxies: Seyfert \u2013 galaxies: individual: Mrk 6\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOver the past nearly 30 years the method of reverberation\nmapping (RM) (Peterson 1988 and reference therein) has\nbecome one of the standard methods for studying the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). It is based on the assumption\nthat in a typical Seyfert galaxy the source of continuous radiation near a black hole, named as accretion disc (AD),\nis expected to be of order 1013 \u2212 1014 cm. Photoionization\nof the gas located at a distance of order 1016 cm produces\nbroad emission lines. The relationship between the continuum and emission line fluxes can be represented by the equation (Blandford & McKee 1982)\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: vdorosh@sai.crimea.ua (VTD);\nsergeev@crao.crimea.ua (SGS).\n\u2020 Deceased, 2011 October 21.\n\nL(t) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03a8(\u03c4 )C(t \u2212 \u03c4 )dt,\n\nwhere C(t) and L(t) are the observed continuum and\nemission-line light curves, and \u03a8(\u03c4 ) is the 1-d transfer function (TF). The TF determines the emission line response to\na \u03b4-function continuum pulse as seen by a distant observer.\nSo, the emission lines \"echo\" or \"reverberate\" in response\nto the continuum changes with a delay \u03c4 . The size of the\nregion where broad lines (BLR) are formed can be written\nas RBLR = c\u03c4 . The primary task of the RM method is to\nuse the observable C(t) and L(t) to solve the above integral\nequation for the TF in order to obtain information about\nthe geometry and physical conditions in the BLR. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find a unique and reliable\nsolution to this equation. However, it is possible to find a\ntemporal shift (lag) between the continuum and emission\nline light curves using the cross-correlation analysis.\n\n\f2\n\nV. T. Doroshenko et al.\n\nApplying the virial assumption, the mass of the black\nhole can be determined when the BLR size and the velocity dispersion of the BLR gas are known (Peterson et al.\n2004). The present tremendous progress being made in black\nhole mass estimates can be attributed to the reverberation\nmethod.\nOn the other hand, different segments of a single emission line seem to be formed at different effective distances\nfrom the ionizing source. In that case, the response in the\nflux of emission line at line-of-sight velocity Vr and time delay \u03c4 is caused by the 2-d transfer function or \"velocity delay\nmap\" (Horne et al. 2004). The reverberation technique applied to different parts of a single emission line allows one to\nmake conclusions about the velocity field of the BLR gas. To\nthe present time, considerable progress was made in understanding the direction of the BLR gas motion (Gaskell 2009;\nBentz et al. 2008; Denney et al. 2009; Bentz et al. 2010).\nFor example, some distinctive signatures for infalling gas\nmotions in NGC 3516 and Arp 151 (Bentz et al. 2009b;\nDenney et al. 2009) were revealed: the blue side of the line\nlagging the red side. NGC 5548 shows the virialized gas motions with the symmetric lags on both the red and blue sides\nof line. However, the BLR gas in NGC 3227 shows the signature of radial outflow: shorter lags for the blue-shifted gas\nand longer lags for the red-shifted gas (Denney et al. 2009).\nMore than 40 AGNs have been studied by the RM up to\nnow (Peterson et al. 2004; Bentz et al. 2009b; Denney et al.\n2010). However, the Mrk 6 nucleus is absent in this list.\nJust a few studies of this galaxy have been made by\nthe reverberation method. We can mention the paper by\nDoroshenko & Sergeev (2003) based on the archive spectra of Mrk 6 obtained from 1970\u20131991 using the image\ntube spectrograph at the 2.6-m telescope of the Crimean\nAstrophysical Observatory (CrAO). There is also another\npaper by Sergeev et al. (1999) that includes the results of\nthe 1992\u20131997 observations with the same spectrograph but\nwith a CCD detector. In this paper a lag in the flux variations of hydrogen lines with respect to the adjacent continuum flux variations was reported for the first time and\nchanges in the line profiles were studied.\nMrk 6 is a Seyfert 1.5 galaxy (Sy 1.5). This galaxy\nwas one of the first galaxies in which the strong variability of the H\u03b2 emission line profile was detected by\nKhachikian & Weedman (1971). Although there have not\nbeen many optical observations of Mrk 6, there are some\nradio studies of Mrk 6 available (Kukula et al. 1996;\nKharb et al. 2006), which revealed the complex structure of the radio emission. The X-ray emission from the\nMrk 6 nucleus (Feldmeier et al. 1999; Malizia et al. 2003;\nImmler et al. 2003; Schurch et al. 2006) exhibits a complex\nX-ray absorption and some authors assume that the BLR is\na possible location of this absorption complex (Malizia et al.\n2003).\nIn this paper we present the results of our optical spectroscopic observations of Mrk 6 during the monitoring campaign from 1998 to 2008 performed after publishing our\nearlier papers with observations made from 1970\u20131997. For\ncompleteness we apply our analysis to all the spectral CCD\nobservations that have been made since 1992 and we also\nuse the results of our photometric observations in the V\nband. Throughout the entire work, we take z = 0.01865\nfrom our spectral estimates, the distance to Mrk 6 equal to\n\nD = 81 Mpc, and H0 =70 km s\u22121 M pc\u22121 . The observations\nand data reduction are described in Section 2. We present\nthe cross-correlation analysis in Section 3, the line width\nmeasurements in Section 4; the estimates of the black hole\nmass, the mass\u2013luminosity and lag\u2013luminosity diagrams are\npresented in Sections 5 and 6, the velocity-resolved reverberation lag analysis is performed in Section 7. The results\nare summarized in Section 8.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nOBSERVATIONS\nSpectral observations and data processing\n\nThe H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 spectra of the Seyfert galaxy Mrk 6 were obtained from the CrAO 2.6-m Shajn telescope. Prior to 2005\nwe used the Astro-550 CCD which had a size 580\u00d7520 pixels and was cooled by liquid nitrogen. The dispersion was\n2.2 \u00c5 pixel\u22121 , and the spectral resolution was about 7\u20138 \u00c5.\nThe working wavelength range was about 1200 \u00c5. The entrance slit width was 3\u2032\u2032 . For technical reasons it was not\nalways possible to set the same position angle (PA) of the\nentrance slit. Most of the observations were performed along\nPA\u223c 125o or PA\u223c 90o . The typical exposure time was about\none hour. The \"extraction window\" was equal to 11\u2032\u2032 .\nIn July 2005 the Astro-550 CCD was replaced with the\nSPEC-10 1340 \u00d7 100 pixel CCD, thermoelectrically cooled\nup to \u2212100o C. In this case the dispersion was 1.8 \u00c5 pixel\u22121 .\nA 3.\u2032\u2032 0 slit with a 90\u25e6 position angle was utilized for these observations. The higher quantum efficiency (95% max.) and\nthe lower read noise of this CCD allowed us to obtain higher\nquality spectra under shorter exposure times. The spectral\nwavelength range for these data sets was about 2000 \u00c5 near\nthe H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 regions. However, the red and blue edges of\nthe CCD frame are unusable because of vignetting. Generally, all spectra in both spectral regions were obtained with\na single exposure during the whole night. Our final data set\nfor 1998\u20132008 consists of 135 spectra in the H\u03b2 region and\n48 spectra in H\u03b1. The mean signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is\nequal to 32 for the Astro-550 and 73 for the SPEC-10 in\nthe H\u03b2 region and is equal to 40 and 66 in the H\u03b1 region,\nrespectively.\nAs a rule, each observation was preceded by four shorttime (\u223c10 s) exposures of the standard star BS 3082, whose\nspectra were obtained at approximately the same zenith distance as that of the galaxy. The spectral energy distribution\nfor these spectra was taken from Kharitonov et al. (1988).\nThe standard star spectra were used to remove telluric absorption features from the spectra of Mrk 6, to provide the\nrelative flux calibration, and to measure the seeing parameter defined as the FWHM of the cross-dispersion profile\non the CCD image. The description of the primary data\nprocessing as well as some details of absolute calibration\nand measurements of the spectra are given in Sergeev et al.\n(1999).\nThe flux calibration was carried out by assuming the\nnarrow emission line fluxes to be constant. We chose the narrow [OIII]\u03bb5007 (for the H\u03b2 region) and [SII]\u03bb\u03bb6717, 6732\nemission lines (for the H\u03b1 region) as the internal flux\nstandards. Their absolute fluxes were measured from the\nspectra obtained under photometric conditions by using the spectra of the comparison star BS 3082. The\n\n\fBlack Hole Mass in Mrk 6\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. Mean Mrk 6 spectrum obtained by combining the\nquasi-simultaneous pairs of spectra from the H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 spectral\nregions (SPEC-10 CCD only).\n\nmean fluxes in these lines are given in Sergeev et al.\n(1999): F([OIII]\u03bb5007)=(6.90 \u00b1 0.11) \u00d7 10\u221213 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 ;\nF[SII] \u03bb\u03bb(6717 + 6731)=(1.61\u00b10.09) \u00d7 10\u221213 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 ,\nand F[OI] \u03bb6300=(0.597\u00b10.035) \u00d7 10\u221213 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 . The\n[SII] lines reside on the far wings of the broad H\u03b1 line. Thus,\nto measure their fluxes, we selected the pseudo-continuum\nzones closely spaced around each line. The line fluxes were\nmeasured by integrating the spectra over the specified wavelength intervals and above the continuum (or local pseudocontinuum), which was fitted with a straight line in the selected zones. The mean continuum flux per unit wavelength\nwas determined in two windows: at 5162\u20135186 \u00c5 (designated as F 5170) and 6985\u20137069 \u00c5 (designated as F 7030).\nThe continuum zones and integration limits are the same as\nin Sergeev et al. (1999). The line and continuum flux uncertainties contain errors related to the S/N of the source spectra, atmospheric dispersion, changes in the position angle of\nthe slit, and seeing effects. Evaluation of these uncertainties\nis considered in Sergeev et al. (1999). The mean spectrum of\nMrk 6 produced by combining 23 quasi-simultaneous pairs\nof spectra from the H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 regions is shown in Fig.1.\nFigure 2 shows the mean and rms spectra of Mrk 6 based\non our observations in 1992\u20132008.\n\n2.2\n\nOptical photometry\n\nIn order to improve the time resolution of our data set\nin the F5170 continuum we added the V -band photometry to our spectral observations. Photometric data came\nfrom two sources: the U BV observations were made at the\nCrimean Laboratory of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute of Moscow University, and the BV RI observations\nwere obtained at the CrAO. The U BV observations were\nobtained in the standard Johnson photometric system and\nwere carried out from 1986 to 2009 at the 60-cm Zeiss telescope with a photo-multiplier detector through the aperture\nA=27.\u2032\u2032 5. The mean uncertainty of Mrk 6 in the V -band is\n0.m 022. These data were partially published by Doroshenko\n(2003).\nIn 2001 we started regular observations of Mrk 6 using\nthe CrAO 70-cm AZT-8 telescope and the AP7p CCD. The\nCCD field covers 15\u2032 \u00d715\u2032 . Photometric fluxes were measured\nwithin an aperture of 15.\u2032\u2032 0. The mean uncertainty of the\n\nFigure 2. Mean and rms spectra of Mrk 6 in the H\u03b2 region from\nour observations 1992\u20132008.\n\nV -band CCD observations is 0.m 009. Further details about\nthe instrumentation, reductions, and measurements of the\nBV RI photometric data can be found in Doroshenko et al.\n(2005). These data were partially published by Sergeev et al.\n(2005).\n2.3\n\nLight curves\n\nLight curves in H\u03b1 and H\u03b2, and the adjacent continuum\nare shown in Fig. 3 for spectral observations corrected for\nseeing. The continuum light curves obtained from the photometric V -band observations were scaled to the flux density measured from the spectroscopic observations. To this\nend, we used the observations made on the same nights almost simultaneously. We have 29 appropriate observational\nnights at the 2.6-m and 70-cm telescopes (spectra plus CCD\nphotometry) and 40 appropriate nights at the 2.6-m and\n60-cm telescopes (spectra plus the U BV photoelectric photometry). The correlation coefficient between the spectral\ncontinuum and the V -band CCD flux for the appropriate\nnights is r=0.984 (n=29 points), and the correlation coefficient between the spectral continuum and the V -band flux\nfrom the U BV observations is r=0.993 (n=40 points). Using\nthe regression equations, we converted our V -band photometric fluxes to the spectral continuum fluxes (F5170). For\nthe nights where both spectral and photometric observations were available, the continuum fluxes are calculated as\nthe weighted average. The fluxes were not corrected for the\nhost starlight contamination and Galactic reddening.\nTables 1 and 2 give the light curves from the\nspectral observations for 1998\u20132008 (the data for\n1991\u20131997 are available in Sergeev et al. 1999). The\nH\u03b2 and H\u03b3 line fluxes together with the spectral\ncontinuum fluxes F5170 are shown in Table 1. The H\u03b1\nline fluxes and the spectral continuum fluxes F7030\nare shown in Table 2. Table 3 gives combined continuum fluxes from both the spectral observations and\nfrom V -band photometric measurements for 1991\u2013\n\n\f4\n\nV. T. Doroshenko et al.\nTable 1.

Narrow lines were not subtracted from the\nfluxes. Bottom panel shows the merged continuum light curve\nused for cross-correlation analysis. Units are 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121\nand 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 for the lines and continua, respectively. The vertical dash-dotted lines show the boundaries of the\nfive time intervals considered in the present paper.\n\n2008. All the fluxes are seeing-corrected. These light\ncurves have been used for the subsequent time-series\nanalysis.\nBottom panel in Figure 3 shows the combined light\ncurve from different telescopes. The combined light curve\nshows long time scale continuum variability in Mrk 6 as well\nas more rapid random changes. The flux maxima were observed in 1995\u20131996 and in 2007.\nStatistical parameters of the light curves for the lines\nand continuum are listed in Table 4. Column 1 gives the\nspectral features; column 2 gives a number of data points;\ncolumn 3 is the median time interval between the data\npoints. The combined continuum light curve is sampled better than the H\u03b2 light curve, the H\u03b2 light curve is sampled\nbetter than H\u03b1. The mean flux and standard deviation are\ngiven in columns 4 and 5, and column 6 lists the variance\nFvar calculated as the ratio of the rms fluctuation, corrected\nfor the effect of measurement errors, to the mean flux. Rmax\nin column 7 is the ratio between the maximum and minimum\nfluxes corrected for the measurement errors. Uncertainties in\nFvar and Rmax were computed assuming that a light curve\nis a set of statistically dependent values, i.e., a random pro-\n\nJD-2,440,000\n\nF

The Fvar values in Table 4 are the lowest limits of\nactual Fvar because the observed fluxes were not corrected\nfor starlight contamination.\n\n3\n\nCROSS-CORRELATION BETWEEN THE\nCONTINUUM AND THE INTEGRAL\nBALMER LINE FLUX VARIATIONS\n\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, estimating the light travel\ntime delay between the continuum and emission line flux\nvariations is of special relevance for the determination of\nthe BLR size, which, in turn, can be used for black hole\nmass measurements (see Wandel et al. 1999; Peterson et al.\n2004). This time delay (or lag) is estimated through the\ncross-correlation function (CCF). Koratkar& Gaskell (1991)\ndemonstrated that the CCF centroid gives the luminosityweighted radius, in contrast to the CCF peak, which\nis more influenced by gas at small radii, according to\nGaskell & Sparke (1986).\nThe time delays were computed using the interpolated\ncross-correlation function (ICCF) (Gaskell & Sparke 1986;\nWhite & Peterson 1994; Peterson 2001). We computed both\nthe lag related to the CCF peak (\u03c4pk ) and the CCF centroid (\u03c4cn ). The CCF centroid was adopted to be measured above the correlation level at r > 0.8rmax . The lag\nuncertainties were computed using the model-independent\nMonte Carlo flux randomization/random subset selection\n(FR/RSS) technique described by Peterson et al. (1998).\nThe number of realizations was as large as 4000. The uncertainties were computed from the distribution function for\n\u03c4pk and \u03c4cn at the 68% confidence, which corresponds to\n\u00b11\u03c3 errors for the normal distribution.\nThe spectra for the 1992 season were obtained with the\n2\u2032\u2032 entrance slit and they were discarded from the CCF analysis in order to exclude the aperture effects. The results of\nthe cross-correlation analysis for the 1993\u20132008 interval are\npresented in Table 5. The meaning of symbols \"s\" and \"scp\"\nin the first and second columns of Table 5 is the same as in\nTable 4: \"s\" \u2013 from spectral observations only and \"scp\" \u2013\nfrom combined spectral and photometric observations (\"c\"\n\u2013 CCD, \"p\" \u2013 photoelectric).\nFigure 4 shows the cross-correlation results for the H\u03b2\nand H\u03b1 line fluxes with the continuum as well as autocorrelation functions of the continuum for the 1993\u20132008 time\ninterval.

We have divided it\ninto five subinterval in order to check whether the lag values\nfor individual sub-intervals are the same as for the entire\n1993\u20132008 period, whether they are changed in time, and\nwhether they are correlated with the fluxes and with line\nwidths. In particular, the effective region of the broad-line\nemission can depend on the incident continuum flux, so the\nlag can depend on the continuum flux. Under a virialized\nmotion of the line-emitting gas the expected relation between the lag \u03c4 and the line width V is as follows: V \u221d \u03c4 \u22121/2 .\nTo this end, we used only the H\u03b2 spectra because more reliable lag estimate for this line, and we carried out the crosscorrelation analysis separately for each of the five time intervals listed in the Table 6. The first and second intervals were\ntaken the same as in the paper by Sergeev et al. (1999).\nThe cross-correlation results for the five time subintervals are given in Table 7. For the continuum light curve in\nTable 7 that consists of the spectral data only (i.e., when\nthe number of data points in both the H\u03b2 and continuum\nlight curves is the same) we have used the standard method\nof the CCF computation with the rebinning both time series. When the photometric data are added to the continuum light curve, only the continuum light curve was rebinned to the times of observation of the H\u03b2 light curve.\nAs for the entire period, the lag uncertainties for the individual subintervals were computed by using the FR/RSS\nmethod as given by Peterson et al. (1998). The uncertainties\nfor each subinterval were computed using 4000 FR/RSS realizations, and the probability distributions for both \u03c4cn and\n\u03c4pk were calculated. Each of these distributions was found to\nbe very different from the normal distribution. To obtain\nthe unweighted mean lag and its uncertainties we\nhave sequentially (one after another) performed the\nconvolution of the five individual distributions and\nthen we have scaled the \u03c4 -axis by dividing it by a\nnumber of subintervals (i.e., by five). After the convolution operation, the final probability distribution\nwas found to be almost normal with the expectation\nand standard deviation as given in Table 7 for the\nmean lag.\nSince there are large gaps in our time series, we decided to investigate in more detail their effect on the lag\nuncertainties for Mrk 6. To make sure that the uncertainties in our lag estimates are realistic, we decided to verify\nthe effect of the sampling of our time series to the lag determination and to compare results with those obtained by\nrandom subset selection (RSS) method. We have generated\nrandom time series with the same autocorrelation function\n\nTable 7.

Stationary random process (or time series) with a given ACF can be generated from an array of\nindependent random values \u03be1 , \u03be2 , \u03be3 , . . . , \u03ben . To do this, it is\nnecessary to find a matrix Uij , such that the multiplication\nof the matrix U to the vector \u03be gives a vector of dependent random values x1 , x2 , x3 , . . . , xn , with a given correlation matrix \u03c1ij = ACF (tj \u2212 ti ), where t1 , t2 , t3 , . . . , tn are\ntimes of observations. The matrix U is related to the correlation matrix \u03c1 as follows:\n\u03c1 = U U T,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere T denotes a transposition operation. We used our own\nalgorithm to compute the matrix U from ACF.\nFirst we have generated 1000 realizations of the continuum light curve with a time resolution of 1 day over a\nperiod of 6452 days, which is longer than the real observed\ntime interval (6175 days).\nTo simulate the H\u03b2 light curve from the continuum light\ncurve we have experimented with the three kinds of transfer\nfunctions: (1) delta-function \u03b4(\u03c4 \u221220), (2) \u03a0-shaped function\nwhich is a constant for 0 < \u03c4 < 40, and (3) triangular function which is linearly decreased down to a zero value from\n\u03c4 = 0 to \u03c4 = 68.3. Here the lag \u03c4 are in units of days. After\nthe convolution with the simulated continuum light curves,\nall the transfer functions give the H\u03b2 light curve with a lag\nof about 20 days. Next the simulated continuum and line\nlight curves were rebinned to real moments of observations\nand the cross-correlation functions were computed for each\nrealization. The lag peak and centroid were measured. The\nlargest uncertainties were obtained when we used the triangular transfer function. These uncertainties are only due\n\n\fBlack Hole Mass in Mrk 6\nto the sampling of the observation data. Table 8 gives a\ncomparison of both methods for uncertainty estimates (i.e.,\nthe random time series versus RSS method) for the triangular transfer function. The columns designated as \u03c4pk and\n\u03c4cn are a lag with \u00b11\u03c3 uncertainties computed from the\nrandom time series, while other two columns designated as\nRSS give \u00b11\u03c3 uncertainties computed from RSS method for\n\u03c4pk and \u03c4cn , respectively. The last column of the table is\nthe mean CCF peak value obtained from the method of the\nrandom time series. As can be seen from this table, the RSS\nmethod gives comparable or larger (up to two times) uncertainties than the method of the random time series does.\nThe random time series method seems to be more direct way\nto estimate lag uncertainties and since the lag uncertainties\nwere computed in this paper by the RSS method, they seem\nto be realistic or slightly overestimated.\nThere is a contradiction between our lag estimate\nand the preliminary results on Mrk 6 published in a\nconference proceeding by Grier et al. (NASA ADS tag\n2011nlsg.confE..52G). This new campaign had a nightly\nsampling rate and it spanned 125 nights beginning 2010\nAugust 31 and ending on 2011 January 3. They claimed\na lag of 8 \u00b1 3 days for the H\u03b2 line in Mrk 6. We have first\nchecked the effect of the removing of linear trends from our\nlight curves (as recommended by some authors, e.g.,\nWelsh 1999). We have removed linear trends from the H\u03b2\nand continuum light curves for each subinterval, even if there\nare no such trends exist. Then we have recalculated a mean\nlag value and it was to be 19 days, i.e. two days less. Then\nwe have generated random time series (continuum and H\u03b2)\nby exactly the same way as described above, but for the\nsampling rate of Grier et al. in order to check whether the\nduration of the monitoring program is important for the lag\nmeasurements. We found that with the data sampling of\nGrier et al. our lag estimate must be less by one more day,\nand so a total difference between our and their results must\nbe three days. The real difference is much larger than three\ndays. An unexpected result of our simulation was very large\nlag uncertainties for the 125-days data sampling and for the\ntriangular transfer function for the H\u03b2 line (see above). The\nlag uncertainties were found to be as large as \u00b16 days! However, for the \u03b4(\u03c4 \u2212 20) transfer function (i.e., when the line\nlight curve is simply a shifted version of the continuum light\ncurve) the lag uncertainties were found to be as small as\n\u223c 0.1 days. So, for short-term campaigns and for transfer\nfunctions with a long tail (i.e., when the line light curve is\nnot only shifted, but a strongly smoothed version of the continuum light curve), the uncertainties in lag estimates can\nbe very large and they are connected to the extrapolation\nof the line and continuum fluxes when computing the CCF,\nnot to the data sampling. We concluded that we can only explain the difference of three days between our and their lag\nmeasurements. Probably, the rest of the difference is due to\nreal changes of lag or due to the measurement uncertainties\nand their underestimation.\nIt can be seen from Table 8 that the simulated lag values are almost the same for all subinterval. The expected\nlag value can be obtained by convolving the ACF with the\ntransfer function and it was found to be: \u03c4pk = 20.7 days\nand \u03c4cn = 22.4 day in an excellent agreement with the simulation results. So, the large gaps in our time series do not\nshift the lag measurements.\n\n11\n\nTable 8.

To decrease the effect of the\nlong-term profile changes on the line width measurements\nand to get sufficient statistics, we measured the H\u03b2 and H\u03b1\nline widths for the five subintervals presented in Table 6.\nThe line width is typically characterized by its full width\nat half maximum (FWHM) or by the second moment of\nthe line profile, denoted as \u03c3line . To measure FWHM for\nthe mean H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 line profiles, we removed narrow lines\nfrom the broad line profiles. This is not required for rms\nprofiles. However, the spectra must be optimally aligned in\nwavelength and in spectral resolution in order to reduce the\nnarrow line residuals in the rms profiles. It is difficult to\nmeasure FWHM because both the mean broad and rms H\u03b2\nprofiles are double-peaked, and so the scatter in the FWHM\nmeasurements is much larger than in \u03c3line which is well\ndefined for arbitrary line profiles. The uncertainties in the\nline width were obtained using bootstrap method described\nby Peterson et al. (2004). The H\u03b2 and H\u03b1 line width (both\nFWHM and \u03c3line ) and their uncertainties are listed in Table 9 for 1993\u20132008. Table 10 gives the \u03c3line computed separately for each considered subinterval and for the H\u03b2 line\nonly.\nWe examined the relationship between the H\u03b2 lag, H\u03b2\nwidth, and the continuum flux (see Fig. 5). No significant\ncorrelations among above three parameters were found. In\nparticular, the virial relationship between the lag and width\ndoes not contradict to our data, but the correlation coefficient between them does not differ significantly from the\nzero value. More subintervals and less lag uncertainties are\nrequired.\n\n\f12\n\nV. T. Doroshenko et al.\n\nTable 10.

The black hole mass is defined by the virial\nequation\nMBH = f\n\nc\u03c4 (\u2206V )2\n,\nG\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the measured emission-line time delay, c is the\nspeed of light, c\u03c4 represents the BLR size, and \u2206V is the\nBLR velocity dispersion. The dimensionless parameter f is\nthe scaling factor, which depends on the BLR structure,\nkinematics and inclination of BLR. Peterson et al. (2004)\nargued that \u03c4cn for the time delay \u03c4 , and \u03c3line , measured\nfrom the H\u03b2 emission line in the rms spectrum for the emission line width \u2206V , provide the most robust estimates of\nthe black hole mass with the reverberation technique. Later\nCollin et al. (2006) confirmed that in most cases for the\nblack hole mass estimate the line dispersion \u03c3line is more\nsuitable than the FWHM, and \u03c3line from the rms-spectrum\nis more suitable than the \u03c3line from the mean spectrum.\nWe adopt an average value of f = 5.5 based on the assumption that AGNs follow the same MBH \u2212\u03c3\u2217 relationship\nas quiescent galaxies (Onken et al. 2004). This is consistent\nwith Woo et al. (2010) and allows easy comparison with pre-\n\nvious results, but this is about a factor of two larger than the\nvalue of f computed by Graham et al. (2011). The value of\nf can be more decreased due to the effect of radiation pressure, as was explored by Marconi et al. (2008, 2009). Marconi et al. suggested that neglecting the effect of radiation\npressure can lead to underestimation of the true black hole\nmass, especially in objects close to their Eddington limit.\nDiscussion between Marconi et al. (2008, 2009) and Netzer\n(2009) shows that there are many unclear questions in this\narea. Naturally, a corrective term for radiation pressure will\ndecrease the f -factor.\nWe calculated the black hole mass for Mrk 6 with the\nuse of \u03c4cn = 21.1 \u00b1 1.9 for the time delay averaged over five\ntime intervals and \u03c3line = 2882 \u00b1 100 km s\u22121 from the rms\nspectra for H\u03b2. With \u03c4cn taken in days and (\u2206V ) in km s\u22121 ,\nand taking into account the time dilation correction for the\nvalue of \u03c4cn , the mass is equal to:\nMBH /M\u2299 = 0.1952 \u00d7 f \u00d7\n\n\u03c4cn (obs)\n\u00d7 (\u2206V )2 .\n(1 + z)\n\nThe black hole mass calculated from the H\u03b2 line is (1.85 \u00b1\n0.21) \u00d7 108 M\u2299 . For the H\u03b1 line, the \u03c4cn = 26.8 \u00b1 7.7 days\nand \u03c3line = 2780 \u00b1 35 km s\u22121 and the black hole mass is\nequal to (2.2\u00b10.6) \u00d7 108 M\u2299 .\nThe black hole masses calculated for each of five periods\nof observations are listed in columns 7 and 8 of Table 10 for\nthe \u03c3line from the mean and rms spectra. One can see that\nall the estimates of the black hole mass based on the H\u03b2 line\nare the same within the scatter.\n\n6\n\nTHE BLR SIZE\u2013LUMINOSITY AND\nMASS\u2013LUMINOSITY RELATIONSHIPS\n\nMany characteristics of the Mrk 6 galaxy are typical for active galaxies. In this connection, it is of interest to see the\nlocalization of this galaxy on the BLR Radius\u2013Luminosity\nand Mass\u2013Luminosity diagrams. These diagrams determine\na relationship between fundamental characteristics of AGNs.\nTo this end, the Mrk 6 luminosity should be known. Up to\nthe present, for many AGNs the luminosity in the rest-frame\n\u03bb0 = 5100 \u00c5 has been corrected for host-galaxy starlight\n\n\fBlack Hole Mass in Mrk 6\n\n13\n\nFigure 6.

This contribution was found to\nbe significant, especially for low-luminosity AGNs.\nWe tried to get at least a rough estimate of the\nhost-galaxy contribution using the observations made by\nNeizvestny (1987) at the Special Astrophysical Observatory\n(SAO) in October 1984 with different apertures from A=4.\u2032\u2032 3\nto 55\u2032\u2032 . The surface brightness distribution in the host galaxy\nof the Mrk 6 nucleus calculated on the basis of these measurements is shown in Fig. 6.\nThe galaxy contribution in our 3\u2032\u2032 \u00d711\u2032\u2032 spectral window was found to be Vgal =15.m 6 or\nFgal =2.08\u00d710\u221215 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 \u00c5\u22121 .\nThe\nmean\nflux\nobserved in the continuum near \u03bb0 =5100 \u00c5 is\nF(gal+nuc) =6.093\u00d710\u221215 ergs\u22121 cm\u22122 \u00c5\u22121 (see Table 4)\nand, thus, the mean flux corrected for the galaxy contribution is equal to Fnuc =4.013\u00d710\u221215 ergs\u22121 cm\u22122 \u00c5\u22121 .\nThe variability amplitude Fvar increases from 18% to 27%\nafter accounting for the galaxy contribution. The mean\nflux was also corrected for Galactic reddening according to the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED)\nSchlegel et al. (1998). The luminosity was found to be\n\u03bbL\u03bb (5100)=(2.51\u00b10.78) \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 adopting the galaxy\ndistance D=81 Mpc and when the galaxy contribution is\nremoved.\nThe bolometric luminosity of the Mrk 6 nucleus was\nadopted to be Lbol \u2243 9\u03bbL\u03bb (5100\u00c5) according to Kaspi et al.\n(2000) and it is equal to Lbol (nucl)=2.26 \u00d71044 erg s\u22121 . This\nluminosity is far from the Eddington limit (LEdd ), which is\nequal to LEdd =2.16\u00d71046 erg s\u22121 for a black hole mass of\n1.8\u00d7108 M\u2299 . In other words, the Eddington ratio for Mrk 6\nis Lbol /LEdd \u2243 0.01. In this case and because there are no\nclear indications of gas outflow from the BLR, the radiation\npressure has a negligible effect on the reverberation mass\nestimate.\nThe position of the Mrk 6 nucleus on the BLR Size\u2013\nLuminosity diagram is shown in Fig. 7. The BLR size and\nthe luminosity of other galaxies in Fig. 7 are taken from\nBentz et al. (2009a) and Denney et al. (2010). The black\nhole masses in Fig. 7 are taken from Peterson et al.

Examples demonstrating how the velocity resolved\nresponses can be related to different types of BLR gas kinematics are given in Peterson (2001) and Bentz et al. (2009b).\nThe random circular orbits generate a symmetric lag profile\nwith the highest lag observed around zero velocity. The infall\nkinematics produces longer lags in the blue-shifted emission,\n\n\f14\n\nV. T. Doroshenko et al.\nlag and associated errors as listed in Table 5. The bottom\npanels show the peak correlation coefficient between the bin\nflux in the line and continuum, rmax . Figure 8 shows that\n\nFigure 8. Two top panels show the H\u03b2 mean and rms profiles\n(left) and the H\u03b1 mean profile (right) divided into ten bins of\nequal flux separated by vertical dashed lines. The flux units for the\nmean and rms profiles are 10\u221213 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 . The third\npanels from the top show the corresponding velocity-resolved time\nlag response, where the delays are plotted at the flux centroid of\neach velocity bin. Here the vertical error bars are 1\u03c3 uncertainties\nin the lag for each velocity bin denoted by the horizontal error\nbars. The horizontal dotted and dashed lines on the third panels mark the mean centroid lag and 1\u03c3 uncertainty, respectively,\nfor the entire emission line. The bottom panels show the peak\nvalue of the correlation coefficient between the bin flux in the line\nand continuum. Here the horizontal dotted lines mark the correlation coefficient rmax between the entire emission line and the\ncontinuum, as calculated in Table 5.\n\nand the outflow gas produces longer lags in the red-shifted\nemission.\nHorne et al. (2004) formulated some important observational requirements for determining a reliable velocity field\nof the BLR: (1) the time duration of observations should be\nat least three times larger than the longest timescale of response, (2) the mean time between subsequent observations\nshould be at least two times less than the BLR light-crossing\ntime, and (3) the velocity sampling \u2206V used for the velocitydelay maps should be no less than the spectral resolution of\nthe data. According to Horne et al. (2004), such conditions\ncan allow one to distinguish clearly between alternative kinematic models of the BLR gas motion.\nIn order to obtain the velocity-delay map, we measured\nthe lag as a function of velocity in several bins across the line\nprofile. We divided both the H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 lines into ten bins\nof equal flux, and the width of these bins was no less than\n1000\u20131500 km s\u22121 . For each bin we calculated light curves\nfrom the Balmer line fluxes. Then each of these light curves\nwas cross-correlated with the continuum light curve following the same procedure as described in Section 3. Figure 8\nshows hydrogen line profiles (mean and rms) subdivided into\nbins (two upper panels). The two middle panels demonstrate\nthe lag measurements for each of the bins. The vertical error\nbars show 1\u03c3 uncertainties for the time lag, and the horizontal bars represent the bin width. The horizontal solid and\ndashed lines in the two middle panels show the mean BLR\n\n(1) The mean and rms profiles of H\u03b2 and H\u03b1 are not\nsymmetric with respect to zero velocity. The centroid of the\nmean and rms profiles is shifted to the short-wave part of\nthe line. The variable parts of H\u03b2 and H\u03b1 have two welldefined peaks, one of them is almost central (between 5 and\n6 bins) and another is blue-shifted. In addition, there is a\nweaker peak in the red part of the line profile.\n(2) The time delay between the higher velocity gas in the\nBLR and the continuum is shorter than the delay between\nthe low velocity gas and the continuum. Such a behaviour\nis typical for virialized gas motions.\n(3) The lag in the blue wing of the H\u03b2 line is greater\nthan the lag in the red side of this line. The H\u03b1 velocityresolved lags shows the same tendency. This is consistent\nwith expectations from the infall model of gas motion. Thus,\nit is possible we have virialized motion combined with infall\nsignatures.\n(4) The correlation coefficient of different segments of the\nlines is different. The bin corresponding to a radial velocity of Vr \u2248 +1500 km s\u22121 shows poor correlation with the\ncontinuum variation, especially in H\u03b2. This fact was earlier\nnoted by Sergeev et al. (1999).\n\n7.2\n\nVelocity delay maps in the five time intervals\n\nWe have computed the velocity-resolved time delays for the\nfive time intervals given in Table 6. For each subset we made\nthe velocity-dependent cross-correlation analysis for the H\u03b2\nline profile bins as described in the previous section. The H\u03b2\nline was selected because its sampling is better. In Figure 9\nthe mean and rms H\u03b2 profiles, the velocity-resolved time lag\nresponse, and the velocity-dependent peak correlation coefficient are shown for the five time intervals. Upon inspection\nof Figure 9 it becomes clear that the mean and rms profiles\nare different among the five periods. The relative intensity in\nthe blue peak and in the central peak changes very strongly:\nduring the first interval the blue peak is higher then the red\none. The opposite situation is seen in the fifth interval. The\nflux in continuum as well the flux in the H\u03b2 line systematically decreased from the second to the fourth time interval,\nas is seen in Figure 3 and Figure 7. The H\u03b2 rms profile shows\ntwo peaks in the first, second and third period, the flat top\nin the fourth period, and in the fifth period we see three\npeaks.\nFigure 8 demonstrates that the high-velocity gas in the\nwings exhibits a shorter lag than the low-velocity gas, supporting the virial nature of gas motion in BLR: the gas kinematics that is dominated by the central massive object.\nHowever, the lag is slightly larger in the blue wing than\nin the red wing for all subintervals. This is a signature of\nthe infall gas motion. In the fifth period (2005\u20132008) the\nvelocity delay map is more symmetric, but the seventh bin\nshows very small lag, as well as in the previous time interval. For 2005\u20132008 there is a poor correlation with the\ncontinuum for bins 7\u201310. A more detailed examination of\nthe bin light curves for 2005\u20132008 (Figure 10) revealed that\nthere is a trend for the H\u03b2 flux in bins 7\u201310, which is almost absent in the bins 1\u20136. Following the advice of our\n\n\fBlack Hole Mass in Mrk 6\n\n15\n\nFigure 9. The same as in Figure 8, but for the H\u03b2 line for the five time intervals.\n\nis a combination of the Keplerian gas motion and infall gas\nmotion.\n\n8\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have reported our new results on the Mrk 6 nucleus from\n1998\u20132008 observational data together with the previous results published by Sergeev et al. (1999). We found that\n\nFigure 10. Light curves in the continuum and H\u03b2 in 2005\u20132008\nover the velocity range from \u22126200 to +4500 km s\u22121 (top panels)\nas well as the light curves of the broad H\u03b2 line in bin 5 in the\nvelocity range from \u2212980 to +25 km s\u22121 , and in the bin 7 in the\nvelocity range from 1000 to 2000 km s\u22121 (bottom panels). The\ncontinuum fluxes are in units of 10\u221215 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 \u00c5\u22121 , and\nthe broad emission line fluxes are in units of 10\u221215 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 .\n\nreviewer we removed the trend from the H\u03b2 light curves for\nbins 7\u201310. No more significant trends were found for other\ntime intervals. In Figure 9 the detrended lags and correlation coefficients are shown by open circles. After detrending\nprocedure, the lag\u2013velocity dependence became more similar to the lag\u2013velocity dependence for the first period, for\nwhich the difference in lag between the blue and red wings\nis largest.\nSo, it is most likely that the BLR kinematic in Mrk 6\n\n(1) The flux of the Mrk 6 nucleus in 1992\u20132008 varied\nsignificantly in the continuum as well as in the H\u03b1 and H\u03b2\nbroad emission lines. The relative amplitude of the continuum flux variability is larger than in the hydrogen lines, and\nit is greater in the H\u03b2 line than in the H\u03b1 (see Table 4). It is\ntypical for the most of Seyfert galaxies. This agrees with the\npredictions of Korista & Goad (2004) based on new photoionization calculations of the BLR-like gas.\n(2) We found the average time delay between the total\nH\u03b2 flux and the continuum flux at 5170 \u00c5 to be 21.1 \u00b1 1.8\ndays, and the time delay does not vary significant among\nindividual time intervals. It seems that the size of the H\u03b2\nemission region remains approximately the same over long\ntime periods. The H\u03b1 flux responds to the changes in the\n+10.6\ndays.\nF 5170 continuum with a lag of 26.8\u22124.8\n(3) When the continuum flux varies, the photo-ionization\nmodels predict the existence of the relation between the BLR\nsize and the luminosity. However, because the large uncertainties in the lag for individual time intervals we are unable\nto find such a relation. For the same reason, it is unable to\nobtain a dependence between the lag and line width, and it\nis impossible to check whether this dependence is consistent\n\n\f16\n\nV. T. Doroshenko et al.\n\nwith the dependence V \u221d r \u22121/2 expected for the gravitationally dominated motion.\n(4) The H\u03b2 line width is larger than that of H\u03b1. This\nis naturally explained by photo-ionization calculations (e.g.,\nKorista & Goad 2004): the effective emission region of H\u03b2\nis smaller and closer to the ionizing source than the effective\nregion of H\u03b1, and the gas velocities in H\u03b2 are higher.\n(5) By examining the velocity-resolved lags for the broad\nH\u03b2 and H\u03b1 lines, we found that the lag in the high-velocity\nwings are shorter than in the line core. This indicates virial\nmotions of gas in the BLR. However, the lag is slightly larger\nin the blue wing than in the red wing for the entire time interval as well as for the individual periods considered in the\npresent paper. This is a signature of the infall gas motion.\nProbably the BLR kinematic in the Mrk 6 nucleus is a combination of the Keplerian gas motion and infall gas motion.\n(6) Some profile segments often show poor correlation\nwith the continuum flux. According to Gaskell (2010) this effect can arise because off-axis sources of ionizing continuum\nflux can appear, which might not make a detectable contribution to the total continuum flux variability, but they\nwill have an influence on the line only over a narrow range\nof radial velocity in the BLR. If these local off-axis events\nwill vary out of phase with the variability of the dominant\nsource, the result will be to give a weak correlation between\nthe continuum flux and the line flux in the narrow range of\nradial velocity.\n(7) We determined the black hole mass from the lag\nand line width measurements of the H\u03b2 and H\u03b1 lines.\nThe mass was found to be MBH = (1.8 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 108 M\u2299\nfor the H\u03b2 line and slightly greater and less reliable from\nthe H\u03b1 line. Under such a mass and the luminosity of\n\u03bbL\u03bb (5100)=(2.51\u00b10.38)\u00d71043 erg s\u22121 , the Mrk 6 nucleus\nis located on the upper edge of the Mass-Luminosity diagram that corresponds to the Eddington ratio of about 0.01.\nThis confirms the assumption (e.g., Sergeev et al. 2011) that\nthere is anticorrelation between broad-line widths and Eddington luminosity ratio Lbol /LEdd . The Mrk 6 position on\nthe BLR Size\u2013Luminosity diagram does not contradict the\nfit RBLR \u221d L0.5 determined by Bentz et al. (2009a).\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the anonymous reviewer for useful comments and\nsuggestions. We also thank S.
