While traditional supersymmetry (SUSY)\nmediation scenarios continue to remain relevant, supersymmetric signals have failed to manifest themselves over the course of several generations of colliders and precision low-energy\nexperiments. As the constraints on the soft parameters have progressively tightened, SUSY\nmodel-building has proliferated, realizing unexplored and sometimes surprising regions of\nthe MSSM parameter space. Given the vast number of possibilities, it is clear that we\nshould be prepared for anything as we enter the LHC era, and that general classification of\nnovel signals is a useful endeavor, independent of any specific UV motivation.\nWith this in mind, we have initiated an inquiry into the phenomenology of a broad,\nrelatively unstudied region of the MSSM, in which the sneutrino acts like the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) at the LHC [1] in place of more standard options such as a\nneutralino. Such spectra have been largely neglected in part because the sneutrino is excluded as a stable thermal relic of the big bang [2, 3], and also because it tends to be\nheavier than other superparticles in minimal mediation scenarios. However, spectra with\nsneutrino NLSP and gravitino LSP are quite cosmologically safe within a standard thermal\nhistory [4\u20136]. We have also seen that obtaining a sneutrino NLSP is straightforward both\nin low-scale mediation frameworks such as General Gauge Mediation [7\u20139], as well as in\nhigh-scale mediation [10\u201314].\nSince it decays invisibly, the sneutrino NLSP is indistinguishable from an LSP within\na collider, leading us to informally dub it an \"(N)LSP.\" Indeed, it would be unclear from\ncollider data alone whether such a particle is the NLSP versus the true LSP within a nonstandard cosmology, or whether it decays via R-parity-violating interactions after exiting\nthe detector. In [1], we found that this class of scenarios can lead to very distinctive signatures, even within the simplest spectra. Our discussion there was limited to cases with\nflavor-degeneracy, small A-terms, squarks/gluinos heavier than at least one neutralino with\nsizable gaugino component, and right-handed (RH) sleptons playing almost no role in the\ncascades.\nGiven these assumptions, every cascade typically has a roughly 30% probability of producing an electron or muon, independent of which electroweak gauginos participate. This\n2\n\n\fis due to the fact that the NLSP sneutrino and its SU(2) partner, the charged left-handed\n(LH) slepton, are generally quasi-degenerate, and will be produced approximately democratically in gaugino decay. In addition, the decays of the charged LH sleptons can also produce\nleptons via W \u2217 emission. In chains where the LH slepton is produced in a neutralino decay\nand subsequently decays leptonically, the two leptons produced will be correlated in charge\nbut uncorrelated in flavor. Together, these features lead to three distinguishing signals:\n1. high rates for multilepton events up to trilepton and even 4-lepton,\n2. a flavor-blind excess of opposite-sign (OS) dileptons over same-sign (SS) dileptons with\na distinctive invariant mass distribution,\n3. the same OS dilepton kinematic feature contained within the trilepton sample.\nHere, we seek to explore some variations on this basic scenario. First, we will relax\nthe assumption that the RH sleptons are effectively decoupled from phenomenology. This\nmeans that we will consider spectra where m(\u1ebdR ) < m(B\u0303), and in which production of\nthe mostly-Bino neutralino in squark/gluino cascades is not too small. We call these \"RHactive\" spectra. Decay chains with RH sleptons will contain additional electron and muon\nemissions, leading to a richer structure of multileptonic signals. Besides overall higher lepton\nmultiplicities-with significant three-, four-, and five-lepton signals-there will be several\noverlapping kinematic distributions in most channels. We note that these spectra share\nmuch in spirit with the \"leptogenic\" SUSY scenario of [15, 16], though with the ordering of\nRH versus LH sleptons reversed, and without CHAMPs (CHArged Massive Particles). In\nparticular, every event will end with two sneutrinos instead of two quasi-stable RH sleptons,\nintroducing different decay topologies and limiting all kinematic reconstructions.\nInterestingly, RH-active spectra can also lead to highly flavor-biased signals within the\nfirst two generations, in spite of the fact that we continue to work exclusively with flavorblind SUSY mediation with small A-terms. In some cases, left-right mixing effects can\nbecome important in the decays of not only the (mostly-)RH stau, but also the RH smuon.\nThis can radically alter the decay chains with RH smuons with respect to RH selectrons,\ndespite the fact that these sleptons will be nearly mass degenerate. For example, a RH\nsmuon can mix into a LH smuon, and decay directly to the NLSP sneutrino by emitting\na real or virtual W . When such mixing-induced smuon decays dominate, they will lead to\n3\n\n\fO(1) flavor non-universality in the multilepton signals. At first sight, the observation of such\nsignals at the LHC could be interpreted as highly flavor non-universal slepton soft terms,\nsimilar to [17\u201320]. However, in our spectra, the non-universality originates entirely with the\n(supersymmetrized) Standard Model Yukawa couplings at tree level.\nThe last variation which we consider here is the class of spectra where the LH stau doublet\nbecomes split off from the first two generations, so that m(\u03bd\u0303\u03c4 ) < m(\u03c4\u0303L ) < m(\u03bd\u0303e,\u03bc ). This can\nhappen due to Yukawa-dependent running effects in high-scale models. In the specific case\nthat we study, all of the slepton doublets become light due to D-term corrections induced\nby a large down-type Higgs soft mass. The large soft mass further drives the flavor splitting.\nThis possibility was pointed out in [10\u201313], and some of the details of its LHC phenomenology\nwere further discussed in [21\u201323].1 Spectra of this type are referred to as \"NUHM\" spectra,\nfor non-universal Higgs mass boundary conditions. The fact that the NLSP (tau sneutrino)\nand NNLSP (mostly-LH stau) both carry tau-number suggests that the products of decay\nchains will be enriched with taus, and indeed this has been the favored collider signature\ndiscussed in the literature [21\u201323]. Here, we will see that the analysis techniques which we\ndevelop for more flavor-degenerate spectra can also be applied in this case, independent of\nthe efficiency for identifying taus.\nIn summary, then, we will be extending our analysis of the simplest sneutrino NLSP\nspectra [1] to incorporate the following possibilities: a non-negligible role for RH sleptons in\nSUSY decay chains, either with or without flavor-dependent decays of the RH sleptons due\nto left-right mixing, and a significantly lighter stau doublet due to running effects from a\nlarge down-type Higgs soft mass. In all of these cases, every SUSY decay chain has several\nnew opportunities to produce electrons and muons, leading to high rates for multilepton\nsignals up to quite high multiplicity. We continue to concentrate on distributions within the\ndileptonic and trileptonic channels, as these have manageable combinatoric ambiguities and\ngood statistics. We will see that these spectra can have significant excess of opposite-sign\nsame-flavor (OSSF) leptons, which typify more standard spectra with a neutralino LSP.\nHowever, this excess will coexist with the characteristic flavor-uncorrelated OS signal of LH\nslepton production and decay, leading to independent excesses in OSSF and opposite-sign\n1\n\nParenthetically, we note that such scenarios may be subject to constraints from \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3, but this depends\nin detail on the structure of the right-handed neutrino sector.\n\n4\n\n\fopposite-flavor (OSOF), mismatched in normalization, shape, and in some cases electron\nversus muon composition. Trilepton will display an additional excess originating from chains\nwhich proceed sequentially through RH sleptons and charged LH sleptons. Again, sign and\nflavor information will serve as useful indicators. Together, the coexistence of all of these\nsignals will be quite suggestive of spectra with a sneutrino NLSP, beyond the simplest cases\ndiscussed in [1].\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section II, we discuss the decays of LH and RH\nsleptons. In section III, we show how the presence of RH sleptons or a light stau doublet\nmodifies the multilepton signals characteristic of simpler sneutrino NLSP scenarios, possibly\nin flavor non-universal ways. We analyze several representative examples in simulation\nin section IV. Section V contains conclusions and discussion. Some technical details are\nrelegated to the appendix.\n\nII.\n\nDECAYS OF THE SLEPTONS\n\nOur focus in this paper will be the multileptonic signals of sneutrino NLSP spectra beyond\nthe simplest models. The leptons are dominantly produced in one of two ways: in the decays\nof gauginos to sleptons, and in the subsequent decay of the sleptons. Up to chargino and\nneutralino mixing effects, which we assume to be modest,2 the former production mechanism\nis quite simple. However, slepton decays can be multifaceted in these spectra, and here we\nwill dedicate some discussion to these decays.\nFirst we will briefly review the main decays of interest for the LH sleptons. We then\nmove on to discuss the simplest, flavor universal decays of RH sleptons. Finally, we discuss\nRH slepton decay modes induced by left-right mixing. These modes will often dominate\nRH stau decays, but can also dominate RH smuon decays, leading to very striking flavor\nnon-universal signals in the first two generations.\n2\n\nAs we will later see from simulation (section IV), this assumption is not strictly necessary, and the behavior\nof the leptonic channels is qualitatively unchanged even in spectra with highly mixed neutralinos. However,\nwe will continue to make this assumption for the purpose of simplifying the discussion.\n\n5\n\n\flj\u2212\n\n\u03bd\u0303i\n\n \u0303li\u2212\n\nq\n\n\u03bd\u0303i\n\n \u0303li\u2212\n\n\u03bd\u0304j\n\nq\u0304\nW \u2212\u2217\n\nW \u2212\u2217\n\nFIG. 1: Possible decay modes of the LH slepton through W \u2217 emission.\nA.\n\nLeft-Handed Sleptons\n\nThe decays of the LH sleptons, SU(2) partners of the NLSP sneutrinos, were seen to be\na crucial ingredient in our original study [1]. The situation is unchanged in the RH-active\nspectra which we consider here, but we present a brief review. We then proceed to discuss\npotentially relevant variations.\nRecall that the splitting between the LH sleptons and the sneutrinos is given mostly by\nD-term interactions with the Higgs VEVs:\nm2W (\u2212 cos 2\u03b2)\nml\u0303 \u2212 m\u03bd\u0303 \u2248\n.\nml\u0303 + m\u03bd\u0303\n\n(1)\n\nOne can clearly see that the splitting cannot exceed the mass of the W , and that any\ndecay of the LH slepton is necessarily three-body. For example, for a doublet mass of\n200 GeV, and tan \u03b2 >\n\u223c 3, the splitting is about 16 GeV. Typically, the dominant diagram\nis the familiar electroweak decay via W \u2217 emission, as in Fig. 1. Branching fractions are as\nusual. 67% of decays produce jets, which are in this case relatively soft and low-multiplicity\ndue to the smallness of the available energy. These decays will likely be quite difficult to\nisolate at the LHC. 11% of decays produce a tau, also a challenging signal, and sometimes\nindistinguishable from a prompt electron or muon production. The remaining 22% of decays\nresult in a relatively clean electron or muon.\nThis lepton is completely uncorrelated in flavor with its parent slepton, and with any\ncharged lepton produced along with the slepton. Therefore, decay chains with an intermediate LH slepton can feature a pair of opposite-sign leptons with no relative flavor structure.\nAs discussed in [1], this leads to equal excesses of OSSF and OSOF lepton pairs, which can\nbe seen in dilepton as well as trilepton events at the LHC. We argued that the observation\nof these unconventional signals would serve as strong evidence for a spectrum with sneutrino\nNLSP where RH sleptons are largely bypassed.\n6\n\n\fl\u2212\n\nl\u2212\n\n\u03bd\u0304\n\n \u0303l\u2212\n\n\u03bd\n\n \u0303l\u2212\n\n\u03bd\u0303\n\n\u03bd\u0303 \u2217\nm\u03c7\n\nFIG. 2: Additional neutralino diagrams contributing to LH slepton decays. The diagram on the\nleft interferes with the W \u2217 leptonic mode. The diagram on the right proceeds via a chirality-flip\non the neutralino propagator.\n\nMore generally, the W \u2217 diagrams are accompanied by other diagrams involving virtual\ncharginos, neutralinos, and, in the case of staus, heavy charged Higgses. Fig. 2 shows the\nneutralino diagrams, which consist of two different, mutually non-interfering cases depending on chirality flow (i.e., whether the  \u0303lL decays into \u03bd\u0303 or \u03bd\u0303 \u2217 ). These can both usually be\nneglected to first approximation, as long as the mass-squared difference between the neutralinos and the LH sleptons is significantly larger than m2W . Equivalently, the LH doublet\nshould be split off from the neutralinos by an amount O(1) times larger than its own internal\n\nD-term mass splitting. In this case, the largest correction to the W \u2217 decays naively comes\nfrom the chirality-flipping process on the right side of Fig. 2, since its rate is enhanced by\n\nm2\u03c7\u0303 /m2l\u0303 with respect to the chirality preserving process. Both of these would introduce an\nL\n\nadditional population of OSSF dileptons, since the flavors of the slepton and final lepton\nare now correlated. However, the chirality-preserving diagrams interfere with the W \u2217 diagrams in the case of same-flavor decays, leading to larger effects than the chirality-flipping\ndiagrams. The interference term can either enhance or deplete the OSSF signals, depending\non whether the neutralino is mostly-Bino or mostly-Wino, respectively. We will not study\ncases where this effect is large enough to be easily observed, but we note that their dilepton signals can be somewhat similar to those of the NUHM spectra which we do study, if\nthe closest neutralino is Bino-like. The case of interference with a mostly-Wino neutralino\nwould, however, be quite distinctive, as it would feature an OSSF deficit from the destructive\ninterference in same-flavor decays.3\n3\n\nFor a mostly-Wino, the relative correction to same-flavor decays from interference goes like \u2212m2W /(m2W\u0303 \u2212\nm2l\u0303 ). (For the Bino, we would make a sign flip and multiply by g12 /g22 .) For example, for a 200 GeV\nslepton and 260 GeV Wino, the correction is roughly \u221220%.\n\n7\n\n\fIn spectra with a light stau doublet, the effects of these additional diagrams become\nimportant for a different reason: for a LH slepton of the first two generations, 3-body decays\ninto \u03bd\u0303\u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 , as well as \u03c4\u0303 \u03c4 , can have much larger available phase space. Chirality-flipping and\nchirality-preserving processes each contribute significantly, leading to an observable OSSF\nexcess beyond the OS excess from the usual W \u2217 decays. We will study spectra of this type\nin more detail below.\nWe note that we will explicitly be assuming that the gap between the tau-sneutrino and\nthe first two generations of LH sleptons only contains the LH stau and the electron- and\nmuon-sneutrinos. In other words, there are no chargino or neutralino states in between\nwhich could cause additional cascades. If this were the case, then we would likely lose any\nindication of the presence of the heavier sneutrinos in the decay chains, as their partner\nsleptons would more likely bypass them to undergo 2-body decays.4\nOf course, we may also consider taking any of the above variations in LH slepton decay\npatterns, and embedding them into a spectrum where RH sleptons are also important. Such\nscenarios could have independent OSSF contributions from LH and RH sleptons, but would\notherwise largely appear identical to the RH slepton cases which we study below.\n\nB.\n\nRight-Handed Sleptons: Flavor Universal Decays\n\nThe RH sleptons must ultimately decay down to the LH slepton doublet. If we neglect\nYukawas, the only available options are real or virtual neutralino emissions, coupling through\nthe Bino component. While the production and decay of a RH slepton is guaranteed to\nproduce an OSSF lepton pair, simply by conservation of quantum numbers, it is clear that\n4\n\nThere are also several similar variations on the LH slepton decays in the flavor-degenerate case, which we\ndo not pursue in detail because they are rather special. However, we mention the simplest of these for\ncompleteness. A trivial possibility is the presence of a neutralino sitting in the small mass gap between\nthe LH sleptons and their sneutrino partners. This would typically lead to nearly 100% same-flavor\ndecays into lepton and neutralino, bypassing the sneutrino. This \"accidental\" scenario would be quite\ndifficult to discriminate from more traditional neutralino LSP spectra. Another possibility is a low SUSYbreaking scale, so that the LH slepton might directly decay to lepton and gravitino, again bypassing\nthe sneutrino. For example, with a 200 GeV (300 GeV) sneutrino in the large tan \u03b2 limit, these decays\n\u221a\nwould be comparable to the leptonic W \u2217 decays for F \u223c 10 TeV (30 TeV) [1]. While these values are\nrelatively small, it is in principle possible for the gravitino decays to have observable effects even for O(1)\nlarger scales. The dilepton signals would again feature an additional OSSF excess from these new decay\nchannels.\n\n8\n\n\fspectra with sneutrino NLSP allow for O(1) probability for production of additional leptons.\nIn the simplest case, a neutralino sits between the RH and LH sleptons. The RH sleptons\ncan then decay via emission of this neutralino and a lepton, assuming the neutralino has nonnegligible Bino fraction. The neutralino subsequently decays into LH sleptons or sneutrinos,\npotentially generating one or more additional leptons. Below, we will consider this as one\nof our standard decay scenarios, but there are other possibilities.\nIn the cases where all charginos and neutralinos are more massive than the RH and LH\nsleptons, decays of the RH slepton proceeds virtually. The rates for these decays generally\ndepend in detail on the mass spectrum and mixing matrix for the neutralinos. For example,\nit is possible for a heavy Bino-like neutralino to contribute more than a lighter Wino-like\nneutralino, or for different levels of neutralinos to contribute comparably and interfere. We\nwill assume here that a single mostly-gauge eigenstate dominates, in which case the relative\nbranching fractions into the different flavors of LH sleptons and sneutrinos are equal up to\nphase space.\nWe show the diagrams for the different 3-body decay modes in Fig. 3. In terms of charge\nand flavor flows, these are no different from the equivalent processes proceeding through\nan on-shell neutralino. But besides the obvious changes in kinematics, there will also be a\nbias in charge. While an on-shell neutralino would decay with equal rate to  \u0303lL+ lL\u2212 and  \u0303lL\u2212 lL+\n(alternately \u03bd\u0303 \u2217 \u03bd and \u03bd\u0303 \u03bd\u0304), the off-shell neutralino propagator is sensitive to chirality flow. In\nparticular, processes with a chirality flip are enhanced by O(m2\u03c7\u0303 /m\u1ebd2R ) compared to those\nwithout the flip, favoring decays into opposite-sign leptons. This would be an interesting\neffect to observe, but may be quite difficult in practice.5 The production and decay of\nthe RH slepton (via these neutralino-exchange modes) will always lead to an OSSF pair of\nleptons, and it will not be obvious which of these two came from the RH slepton's decay.\nThe overall magnitudes of the 3-body decay widths are naively unimportant for phenomenology, as long as the decays are prompt. However, we need to know these in order\nto determine the branching fractions for the flavor non-universal decays, to be discussed\nshortly.6 Formulas for the partial decay widths can be found in the appendix.\n5\n\n6\n\nA very similar effect in minimal gauge mediation was pointed out in [24]. In that case, decays of RH\nsleptons into the RH stau NLSP are also sensitive to the chirality flow.\nDirect decays to gravitinos are also technically possible. However, it is quite non-generic for these to be\nimportant except in cases of accidental mass degeneracies or very heavy gauginos.\n\n9\n\n\f\u2212\nlR\n\n\u2212\nlR\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u1ebd\u2212\nR\n\n\u1ebd\u2212\nR\n\n\u03bd\u0303 \u2217\n\n\u2212\nlR\n\nm\u03c70\n\n\u1ebd\u2212\nR\n\n\u03bd\u0303\n\nlL+\n\n\u2212\nlR\n\nlL\u2212\n\n \u0303l+\nL\n\n\u1ebd\u2212\nR\n\n\u03bd\u0304\n\nm\u03c70\n\n \u0303l\u2212\nL\n\nFIG. 3: Decay modes of the RH sleptons through off-shell neutralinos. Note that the rates from\ndiagrams on the right side are enhanced by O(m\u03c7\u03032 /m2\u1ebdR ) due to the mass insertions of the neutralino.\nC.\n\nRight-Handed Sleptons: Flavor Non-Universal Decays from Left-Right Mixing\n\nA more complete treatment of the decays of RH sleptons includes modes induced by leftright mixing. Naively, these are only important for staus, but we will show below that one\ncan easily find spectra where they are also important for smuons. This can lead to highly\nflavor non-universal signals with respect to electrons and muons.\nTo start, we assume that any effects from flavor violation in the soft terms are completely\nabsent. At the input scale, the slepton mass-squared matrices are proportional to the unit\nmatrix, and A-terms are zero. These will develop flavor non-universal contributions from\nrunning, originating from the Yukawas, but their presence will not qualitatively change the\npicture. For simplicity, we assume that they are subdominant to the tree-level Yukawa\neffects.7 This situation naturally holds in low-scale mediation scenarios, such as (general)\ngauge mediation.\nGiven these assumptions, the dominant flavor effects in the soft masses are the left-right\nmixing terms induced by (F -term) Yukawa couplings to the Higgs VEVs. Each generation\n7\n\nThis is the usual situation for the A-terms when tan \u03b2 is large. We also note that there may be lepton\nflavor-violating contributions from gravity-scale mediation effects, or from running through the see-saw\nthreshold. We further assume that these are small.\n\n10\n\n\fW\n\n\u1ebdR\n\nZ\n\n \u0303lL\n\n\u1ebdR\n\n\u03bd\u0303\n\nh\n\n\u1ebdR\n\n \u0303lL\n\nFIG. 4: Possible two-body electroweak decays modes of the RH sleptons.\n\nof sleptons has an independent 2 \u00d7 2 matrix of soft masses, of the form\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n2\n\u2212\u03bcvY\nsin\n\u03b2\nm\nl\nl\u0303L\n\uf8f8 .\nM2 = \uf8ed\n2\n\u2212\u03bcvYl sin \u03b2\nm\u1ebdR\n\n(2)\n\nHere v denotes the VEV of the Higgs, and Yl is the SM Yukawa coupling for lepton l,\n\ndefined as Yl = ml /(v cos \u03b2).

However, we saw cases above where the RH sleptons were\nforced to decay down to the LH slepton doublet via 3-body processes mediated by off-shell\ngauginos. With left-right mixing, a RH slepton can interact with electroweak gauge bosons,\nopening up additional 2-body decays if m\u1ebdR \u2212 ml\u0303L >\n\u223c 100 GeV (Fig. 4). It is not difficult\n\nto find spectra where these 2-body, flavor-dependent decays become very important for\nsmuons. However, it is practically impossible for them to be relevant for selectrons, since\nthe Yukawa is too small. This mismatch in the behavior of RH smuons versus RH selectrons\nwill ultimately manifest at detector level as an asymmetry between muons and electrons.\nWhile the presence of RH selectrons in a chain essentially guarantees the production of an\nOSSF e+ e\u2212 pair, the muon-number from RH smuons may \"disappear\" into sneutrinos. RH\n\nsmuon decays will sometimes generate additional leptons, from W or Z decay, but these will\nbe flavor-uncorrelated.\nThe rate for the decay of a RH slepton directly into a sneutrino via on-shell W emission\n\n11\n\n\fis\n\u0393(\u1ebdR \u2192 W \u03bd\u0303) =\n=\n\n\u03b12 \u03b4l2 \u03bb3/2 (m2\u1ebdR , m2\u03bd\u0303 , m2W )\n8\nm3\u1ebdR m2W\nYl 2\n\u03bc2 sin2 \u03b2 \u03bb3/2 (m2\u1ebdR , m2\u03bd\u0303 , m2W )\n16\u03c0 (m2\u1ebdR \u2212 m2l\u0303 )2\nm\u1ebd3R\n\n(4)\n\nL\n\nwith\n\u03bb(x, y, z) \u2261 x2 + y 2 + z 2 \u2212 2xy \u2212 2yz \u2212 2xz .\n\n(5)\n\nBy angular momentum conservation, the decays are exclusively into longitudinal W , which\neffectively couples as a Goldstone boson. The analogous decay into Z  \u0303lL is simply two times\nsmaller than this, with the kinematic factor \u03bb appropriately modified.\nThere is also a 2-body decay mode into a physical Higgs, with parametrically very similar\nrate, again controlled by Yukawas. The rate is\n\u03bb\nY2\n\u0393(\u1ebdR \u2192 h \u0303lL ) = l \u03bc2 cos2 \u03b1\n32\u03c0\n\n1/2\n\n(m2\u1ebdR , m2l\u0303 , m2h )\nL\n\nm3\u1ebdR\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the physical Higgs mixing angle, which tends to be close to zero for large tan \u03b2.\nThese formulas should be compared to those for the 3-body RH slepton decays, which can\nbe found in the appendix. The full parametric dependences of the relative rates are rather\ninvolved, even in kinematically simplified limits. However, we can perform a comparison\nof the mass-independent factors, with the understanding that there is still room for a large\namount of numerical engineering. We find\n\u03932\u2212body\nY 2 sin2 \u03b2/16\u03c0\n\u223c l 2 5\n\u00d7 (mass factors)\n\u03933\u2212body\n\u03b11 /2 \u03c0\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\u22124\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n2 \u00d7 10 \uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd \u0012 tan \u03b2 \u00132\n\uf8f2\n\u00d7 (mass factors)\n\u223c\n8\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n10\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\n2400\n\n(7)\n\nfor (e,\u03bc,\u03c4 ), respectively. It is clear that RH selectrons will practically never decay via 2body, whereas RH staus will very likely be dominated by 2-body, when those modes are\nkinematically available. The RH smuon occupies a highly sensitive point, such that the\nrelative 2-body rate will depend on the detailed mass spectrum and tan \u03b2. Below, we will\ninvestigate spectra where this relative rate is both large and small.\nLeft-right mixing effects can also be important for more general sets of spectra, again\ntending to hide the muon-number in RH smuon decays.\n12\n\nFor example, we can have\n\n\fm\u1ebdR \u2212 ml\u0303L <\n\u223c mW , such that 2-body electroweak decays are shut off. However, 3-body\nelectroweak decays will still contribute. If the mostly-Bino neutralino is relatively heavy\nand unmixed, then decays via left-right mixing may nonetheless be preferred for smuons.\nAnother possibility is a mostly-Wino in between the RH and LH sleptons. If the neutralino\nmixing is small enough, RH smuons may again prefer to decay via left-right mixing. Decays\ninto the mostly-Wino neutralino will then proceed anyway because of this mixing, but so\nwill decays (with twice the rate) to charginos, and to gauge bosons if the phase space is\navailable. We will not analyze these cases in detail, as they will lead to qualitatively the\nsame effects as cases where decays into on-shell electroweak bosons dominate.\n\nIII.\n\nLEPTONIC SIGNALS\n\nWe now describe our main signals in detail, before moving on to collider studies in section IV. We will first discuss the generic multileptonic signals of RH-active spectra. We\nwill then focus on the signals with the highest rates and the least combinatoric ambiguities, namely dileptonic and trileptonic channels. Subsequently, we will see how flavor nonuniversalities can manifest in these channels, if electroweak decays of the RH smuons are\nimportant. Finally, we will discuss the tau-independent signals of the NUHM spectra, and\nhow the techniques for investigating RH-active spectra can also apply in this case.\n\nA.\n\nHigh-Multiplicity Signals of RH-Active Spectra\n\nAs we have seen in section II, chains with a RH slepton can potentially generate a large\nnumber of leptons. The most extreme case would be \u03c7\u03030 \u2192 l\u1ebdR \u2192 l(ll \u0303lL ) \u2192 lll(l\u03bd \u03bd\u0303). If\nthis were to occur on both sides of an event, the number of leptons would tally to eight.\nOf course, this exceptional class of events is also quite rare, since many branching fraction\npenalties and detection efficiencies would have to be paid. But this still tells us that we can\nexpect these events to be quite \"leptophilic.\"\nSuch behavior contrasts with that of spectra where RH sleptons do not significantly\nparticipate, where we were relatively lucky to get an observable 4-lepton signal after a\n100 fb\u22121 LHC run. There, neither the production nor the decay of  \u0303lL was guaranteed to\nproduce a lepton. We nonetheless could expect to find significant dilepton and trilepton\n\n13\n\n\fsignals. With spectra where RH sleptons are produced with an appreciable rate, we will see\nbelow that we might reasonably find observable multilepton rates up to 5-lepton or 6-lepton,\nwith healthy populations in the lower-multiplicity bins. Needless to say, the backgrounds\nfor such dramatic signals are small.\nSimilar behavior was pointed out in [16] in the context of low-scale gaugino mediation.\nThis is not surprising, given that the spectra which we analyze here are in some cases nearly\nthe same, but with the ordering of the LH and RH sleptons reversed. However, we point out\nthat there will always be significant differences in the phenomenology of these spectra. The\nspecific scenario investigated in [16] contained a metastable mostly-RH stau as the NLSP,\nleading to striking CHAMP signals. Even if the SUSY-breaking scale were lowered, such\nthat RH sleptons decay promptly, then every chain is guaranteed to independently produce\nan OSSF lepton pair or tau pair. Such a scenario would be much more leptophilic than ours.\nIt is also possible that RH selectrons and smuons first decay to stau, which then decays to\ntau and gravitino, leading to at least four taus per event, in addition to the two OSSF pairs.\nIf even a fraction of these taus and leptons are detected with good efficiency for every event,\nthey will still be quite suggestive of scenarios with RH slepton NLSP.\nAlthough high-multiplicity leptonic channels will serve as very clean evidence for new\nphysics, we will not utilize signals with four or more leptons for any analysis beyond simple\ncounting. The main reasons for this are the formidable combinatorial uncertainties and the\noverall lower statistics. In any case, the only new kinematic information contained in these\nevents would be the 4-lepton distributions from a single decay chain. For the purposes of\nthis study, we consider these distributions as lost, and instead we will concentrate on the\ndileptonic and trileptonic events.\n\nB.\n\nDileptons\n\nIn [1], the dileptonic distributions had two major classes of contributions. The first was\nfrom events where one chain produced opposite-sign, flavor-uncorrelated leptons from LH\nslepton production and decay (Fig. 5), and the other chain produced no visible leptons.\nThe second contribution came from events where each chain produced a single lepton (from\neither slepton production or decay). These leptons were totally uncorrelated in both sign and\nflavor. The full set of SUSY dilepton invariant mass spectra contained a broad contribution\n14\n\n\flj\u2212\n\nli+\n\n\u03bd\u0304j\n\nW\u2212\n0\n\n\u03c7\n\n \u0303li\u2212\n\n\u03bd\u0303i\n\nFIG. 5: The sub-cascade responsible for the OS dilepton excess in chains with LH sleptons.\n\nfrom this latter class of events, equally distributed between all sign and flavor bins. The\ncorrelated leptons from a single chain, on the other hand, led to a more localized bump,\nwhich appeared with equal rates in OSSF and OSOF channels. The correlated distribution\ncould be extracted using a simple sign-subtraction procedure, and its peak could be used to\ninfer relationships between the gaugino, LH slepton, and sneutrino masses:\ns\n(m\u03c7\u03032 \u2212 m2l\u0303 )(m2l\u0303 \u2212 m2\u03bd\u0303 )\npeak\nmll \u2248 0.48\n.\nm2l\u0303\n\n(8)\n\nThese signals will persist in RH-active spectra, but there will also be one qualitatively new\n0(\u2217)\n\ncontribution. The sub-cascade \u03c70a \u2192 \u1ebdR \u2192 \u03c7b\n\n(see Fig. 6) produces two leptons correlated\n\nin both sign and flavor. When these are the only leptons produced in a chain, and the other\nchain in the event produces no leptons, a new dilepton excess is generated in the OSSF\nchannel. This signature is well-known in traditional spectra with a neutralino LSP, where\nit is separated from the uncorrelated dilepton distribution by using a flavor-subtraction,\nOSSF-OSOF. In sneutrino NLSP spectra, this signal will coexist with the OS distribution\nfrom LH slepton production/decay, as well as the background of totally uncorrelated SUSY\ndileptons. The situation is illustrated in Fig. 7.\nThe shape of the OSSF excess depends on further details of the decay process. In the\ncase that a neutralino sits below the RH slepton, such that the RH slepton can undergo\na 2-body decay, the distribution will be of the characteristic ramp-and-edge shape. If the\ndecays are 3-body, then the distribution takes on a more bump-like shape, similar to the\nshape of the OS excess. However, the distribution will usually be skewed to some extent\ntoward higher masses.\nClearly, as Fig. 7 suggests, extracting both of the independent kinematic shapes from the\ndifferent sign and flavor channels is slightly nontrivial, but still straightforward.

The independent contributions from LH sub-cascades, RH\nsub-cascades, and uncorrelated dileptons are shown in teal, red, and brown, respectively.\n\nsimply perform two independent subtractions: OSSF-OSOF to reveal the RH contribution,\nand OSOF-SSOF to reveal the LH contribution.8 Unfortunately, it would be impossible at\nthis level of analysis to independently extract the LH contribution within the OSSF channel,\nand verify that it is equal to the contribution within the OSOF channel. However, the crucial\nobservation at this point, already suggestive of the presence of sneutrinos in the chains,\nis that the OSOF-SSOF subtraction gives a nonzero result at all. More realistically, we\nwill require that this subtraction gives a statistically significant excess above opposite-sign,\nflavor-uncorrelated backgrounds from the Standard Model, such as tt\u0304. We will demonstrate\nthat this is possible in section IV.\n8\n\nIt is possible (though not generic) to get sign correlations in the contributions from leptons produced in\nindependent decay chains, due to biases in production. In that case, the shapes in the OS and SS channels\nwill likely be very similar, but their normalizations could be different. It would then still be possible to\nperform a weighted OSOF-SSOF subtraction, such that the high-mass tail is canceled off.\n\n16\n\n\fMore generally, it is possible that the OSSF contribution from LH sleptons has a different normalization from those in the OSOF channel, for example due to the interference\neffects mentioned in subsection II A. While we have just emphasized that this cannot be\nindependently checked, we note that with high enough statistics it may be possible to see\nadditional peaks or dips in the shape of the OSSF-OSOF excess. The presence or absence of\nsuch features becomes particularly informative if the OSSF-OSOF and OSOF-SSOF shapes\nare sufficiently distinct.\n\nC.\n\nTrileptons\n\nThe trileptonic channel will also have a sizable signal, more so than in the case without\nthe RH sleptons. Originally, the main way to obtain trilepton was to have one chain produce\ntwo leptons from LH slepton production and decay (Fig. 5), and the other chain to produce\none additional lepton. The combinatorial ambiguities were therefore fairly simple, and we\ndemonstrated in [1] a straightforward way to identify which two leptons were produced in\nthe same chain. Now, this channel can have a variety of contributions from the production\nand decay stages of both RH and LH sleptons, including the option for all three leptons\nbeing produced in the same chain.\nLet us start analyzing the possibilities by categorizing the sign and flavor content of the\ntrileptons. Generally, the majority of these events will have two same-signed leptons and\na single \"uniquely-signed\" lepton. In other words, trileptonic events with all leptons of the\nsame sign will be subdominant. For example, if the leptons were all totally uncorrelated,\nonly 1/4 of the events would be fully same-signed. More realistically, this fraction will\nbe even smaller, since there are often physical sign correlations, most obviously in the OS\ndileptons produced in either RH or LH production/decay. We will subsequently focus our\nanalysis exclusively on the cases with a uniquely-signed lepton, since we do not expect\nall-same-signed to carry much useful kinematic information. However, the observation of\nsame-signed trilepton events is yet another clue to the simultaneous presence of RH and LH\nsleptons, and may serve as an extremely clean (re-)discovery signal.\nGiven that we have one uniquely-signed lepton, we can further classify the flavor structure\nof these events. We compare the flavor of the uniquely-signed lepton with the flavors of the\ntwo same-signed leptons, leading to three distinct cases:\n17\n\n\f\u2022 SFSF - both parings are of the same flavor, those are either all-electron or all-muon\nevents,\n\u2022 SFOF - one pair is of the same flavor and the second pair is of the opposite flavor,\n\u2022 OFOF - both pairings include opposite flavors.\nWe can now perform counting experiments within these three channels, to attempt to deduce\nthe composition of the events.\nFirst, consider spectra with relatively inactive RH sleptons, where all trilepton events\ncontain a LH slepton production/decay. In this case, while two of the leptons are signanticorrelated, the flavors of all three leptons are completely uncorrelated. For example, if\nthe uniquely-signed lepton is an e\u2212 , then there is equal probability for the same-signed pair\nto be e+ e+ , e+ \u03bc+ , \u03bc+ e+ , and \u03bc+ \u03bc+ .9 This correspond to SFSF, SFOF, SFOF, and OFOF,\nrespectively. Quite generally, then, we expect the counting ratio OFOF:SFOF:SFSF to be\n1:2:1.\nNow suppose instead that the trilepton contribution is exclusively from RH slepton production/decay in one chain, with additional uncorrelated lepton, either emitted in the other\nchain or in a subsequent LH slepton production or decay. The first process is guaranteed to\nproduce an OSSF pair, and one of these is in turn guaranteed to be the uniquely-signed lepton in the event. Given that one of the remaining leptons is perfectly flavor-correlated with\nthis, and the other perfectly flavor-uncorrelated, we expect equal contributions to SFOF and\nSFSF, and vanishing OFOF. We therefore get OFOF:SFOF:SFSF of 0:1:1.\nRH-active sneutrino NLSP spectra will exhibit a superposition of 1:2:1 and 0:1:1, with the\nlatter represented in proportion to the amount of RH slepton production. The observation\nof both of these contributions added together would serve as a powerful supplement to the\ninterpretation already suggested by the dilepton analysis. The simplest way to check this\nis to first verify the presence of a substantial OFOF contribution, and then to add together\nOFOF and SFSF, and see if the sum matches SFOF.\nThere will also be additional flavor-uncorrelated contributions, even from chains with RH\nsleptons. For example, we may fail to reconstruct one of the leptons from its production or\n9\n\nNote that e+ \u03bc+ and \u03bc+ e+ are indeed distinct. The general event structure is li\u2212 lj+ lk+ , with each of the\nthree leptons (i,j,k) produced in independent, flavor-blind subprocesses.\n\n18\n\n\fdecay, and pick up two other unrelated leptons. However, these events do not tend to be very\ncommon. In spectra with LH and RH together, on the other hand, the flavor-uncorrelated\nevents would usually constitute a major fraction of the trileptons. A simple indicator of\nthe presence of the sneutrino NLSP is therefore the relative size of the OFOF, which is\nnominally absent or small for trilepton signals dominated by RH. Equivalently, we should\npay attention to the fraction of trilepton events that lack an OSSF pairing.\nHaving established the basic trilepton sign/flavor channels, we can now proceed to investigate kinematic distributions. We can first attempt to recover the analysis of [1], in which\nwe \"rediscover\" the dilepton invariant mass distribution from LH slepton production and\ndecay (now extracted via OSOF-SSOF subtraction, as above). The easiest way to do this in\nthe presence of RH contamination is to focus on the OFOF channel. This reduces statistics\nby a factor of four, but leads to a signal which is much easier to interpret and compare to\nthe dileptons.\nWe can further inquire into whether we can extract kinematic distributions involving\nthe RH sleptons, which will occupy the SFOF and SFSF channels. There will be two main\nclasses of RH events contributing, depending on where the third lepton comes from: either it\nis produced along with a LH slepton further down the chain, or it comes from the other side\nof the event.10 Since the flavor of the third lepton is uncorrelated in both cases, we cannot\nuse this information to disentangle the two distributions. There is potentially a charge bias\nfor leptons produced along with the LH sleptons in 3-body RH slepton decay, as pointed\nout in subsection II B. However, we also pointed out that it might be very difficult to spot.\nWe therefore tentatively consider these two samples to be completely entangled.\nThis must then be added to the LH contribution. But, in principle, we can subtract out\nthis contribution by utilizing its different flavor structure. OFOF is dominantly LH, and we\ncan predict its contribution to the other channels using the 1:2:1 ratio above.\nIn particular, we can access the OSSF dilepton distribution embedded in the trilepton\nsample as follows. First, we construct the LH-dominated dilepton distribution in OFOF by\nmaking random pairings with the uniquely-signed lepton. This will contain equal amounts\nof correct pairings and incorrect pairings. Then we form the dilepton distribution in SFOF,\n10\n\nIt may also come from the decay of the LH slepton further down the chain. This would require us to miss\nthe lepton associated with the LH slepton production (lest the event end up classified as 4-lepton), as well\nas to pay the branching fraction price of 22%. These therefore represent a subdominant contribution.\n\n19\n\n\fusing the unique OSSF pair. This will contain the distribution we are after, as well as\nthe LH contamination, also randomly paired due to the lack of flavor structure. Last, we\nsubtract off twice the distribution of OFOF. Assuming we have enough statistics to obtain\na meaningful final distribution, this can be checked against the OSSF excess found in the\ndileptonic channels.\nUsing similar logic, we can try to access the trilepton invariant mass distribution from\nRH slepton production and decay, with subsequent LH production in the same chain. The\nprecise shape of this distribution with all of the intermediate states on-shell was studied\nin detail in [25]. It can serve as a useful supplement to the kinematic information already\navailable from the dilepton distributions. To maximize statistics, we take all trileptons from\nthe SFOF and SFSF channels (equivalently, all events in which we can find an OSSF pair),\nand subtract from this three times the trilepton distribution of the OFOF events. This\nwill leave over the contribution of genuine correlated trileptons, all from the same chain,\nbut combined inextricably with the uncorrelated RH distribution. Of course, even if this\nsubtraction is too awkward to carry out due to limited statistics, or the purification ends up\nbeing only modest due to the unsubtractable RH combinatorial background, we may still\nsimply plot the SFOF+SFSF distribution and look for a bump. For the samples which we\nstudy in section IV, at 100 fb\u22121 luminosity, we take the latter tactic.\n\nD.\n\nFlavor Non-Universal Signals from Left-Right Mixing\n\nAs we discussed in subsection II C, it is possible for otherwise flavor-blind spectra to\nexhibit large differences between the decays of RH selectrons and RH smuons. The latter\ncan have non-negligible left-right mixing originating from the Yukawa couplings. This can\ncause the RH smuons to dominantly decay via electroweak or Higgs boson emission, and\nultimately lose their muon-number to a sneutrino. The RH selectron, on the other hand,\nwould usually decay via neutralino emission, converting into an electron.\nWe can immediately infer the effects of these flavor non-universal decays on the dilepton\nsignals. The OSSF excess that would otherwise have been generated in RH smuon production\nand decay will no longer exist. In principle, then, we could observe that the excess in OSSF\nis entirely composed of electron pairs. Of course, the situation is not so simple, since we do\nnot know which pairs came from RH sleptons event-by-event. But we can still isolate the\n20\n\n\fpresence of the excess by subtracting OSSF(e+ e\u2212 )-OSSF(\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ). This should practically\nequal the OSSF-OSOF distribution. A similar strategy was employed in [20], for spectra\nwith lepton flavor violation in the SUSY soft terms (incorporating RH sneutrinos).\nThe RH smuon will not completely disappear from the dilepton channels, but its signatures will be highly attenuated and redistributed. Decays mostly proceed into W (\u2217) \u03bd\u0303, with\nthe RH smuon acting like a LH smuon with a larger mass gap. In these decays, we get\nthe usual 22% chance to generate a second lepton of opposite-sign but uncorrelated-flavor.\nWe will therefore get a small enhancement of the OS excess, albeit at higher invariant mass\nthan that caused by genuine LH sleptons. It will also be flavor-biased, consisting only of\n\u03bc\u03bc and \u03bce. Decays into Z (\u2217)  \u0303lL and h(\u2217)  \u0303lL can further contribute when the  \u0303lL decays leptonically.11 Finding these signals may be relatively difficult without rather high statistics. To\nfirst approximation, we will consider the dileptonic signals of the RH smuons as lost.\nThe deficit of RH smuon decays will also manifest in the trilepton channels. The channels\ncontaining an OSSF pairing (SFOF+SFSF) will generally contain fewer muons. One way to\nsee the effect is to simply plot the number of muons in these events. If the signals were perfectly flavor universal, the trilepton signal from RH sleptons would contain (0\u03bc, 1\u03bc, 2\u03bc, 3\u03bc)\nin equal ratio. The signal from LH sleptons (with no flavor structure whatsoever) gets added\nin with ratio 1:3:3:1. We therefore expect, quite robustly, that completely flavor-blind chains\nwill have equal amounts of 0\u03bc and 3\u03bc, and equal amounts of 1\u03bc and 2\u03bc. In the spectra with\nsignificant left-right mixing, the higher multiplicities are depleted, leading to biases 0\u03bc > 3\u03bc\nand 1\u03bc > 2\u03bc.\nOf course, it is also possible to have an intermediate case, where some non-dominant\nfraction of RH smuon decays go through electroweak channels. This would lead to smaller,\nbut possibly still observable flavor biases.\nWe expect that similar kinds of electron-muon asymmetries can manifest in leptogenic\nSUSY [16]. Indeed, the possible importance of left-right mixing on (LH) smuon decays was\nalso pointed out in that context, though there the muon counting was highly \"contaminated\"\nby misidentified stau CHAMPs. In similar scenarios with promptly-decaying stau NLSP,\nit may be possible to immediately observe an asymmetry between electrons and genuine\nmuons. It would be interesting to study these effects in spectra similar to [15, 16] in more\n11\n\nA small fraction will also contribute to trilepton, when the Z decays leptonically.\n\n21\n\n\fli\n\nli\n\n\u03bd\u03c4\n\nl \u0303Li\n\n\u03c4\n\nl \u0303Li\n\n\u03bd\u0303\u03c4\n\n\u03c4\u0303\n\u03c7\u03030\n\n\u03c7\u03030\n\nFIG. 8: Important decay modes of the LH slepton in spectra with a light stau doublet. Note that\nthe lepton flavor is correlated with its parent.\n\ndetail.\n\nE.\n\nSignals with a Light Stau Doublet\n\nIf the mediation scale is relatively high, the LH stau doublet can be significantly pushed\ndown in mass compared to the first two generations, due to Yukawa effects in the running\nof the soft masses. In particular, this occurs in the NUHM spectra of [12, 13]. We saw\nabove, in subsection II A, that splitting off the third generation can significantly change the\ndecay modes of the LH sleptons of the first two generations, introducing sizable branching\nfractions into l(\u03bd\u0303\u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 ) and l(\u03c4\u0303 \u03c4 ).12 The relevant diagrams are illustrated in Fig. 8.\nWhen dealing with these spectra, we shall revert to the assumption that RH sleptons are\nbypassed. Nonetheless, in some sense the LH sleptons of the first two generations take their\nplace. The new decay modes now serve to populate an excess in the OSSF dilepton channel,\nin addition to the OS excess from the competing W \u2217 decay modes. The presence of these\ntwo overlapping excesses can be inferred, and their distributions separated, exactly as for\nthe RH-active scenarios discussed above.\nThese spectra will also appear to be quite leptophilic. Tau production is now naturally\nquite high, and each tau has an approximately 35% chance of manifesting as an isolated\nelectron or muon. In fact, since tau (and stau) decays proceed through W \u2217 , we end up\nwith several new opportunities for OS, flavor-uncorrelated dilepton signals. These signals\n12\n\nDetailed analytic expressions can be found in [26]. Expressions for the case of a single neutralino dominating the decay can be found in our appendix, though we note that interference effects between Bino\nand Wino can be quite substantial, as the masses and couplings are in direct proportion in high-scale\nscenarios with unified gaugino mass. Decays into \u03bd(\u03bd\u0303\u03c4 \u03c4 ) and \u03bd(\u03c4\u0303 \u03bd\u03c4 ), via chargino exchange, will also be\npresent, but they do not significantly change the phenomenology.\n\n22\n\n\fwill usually be biased towards low invariant mass, as the energy of the original tau must\nbe shared with two neutrinos. These new OS distributions will be irreversibly added on\ntop of the OS excess from the production and W -mediated decay of LH sleptons of the\nfirst two generations.13 While the presence of this tau \"contamination\" actually increases\nthe leptonic rates, improves chances for discovery of a new physics signal, and moreover\nindicates the presence of significant tau production through its shape, we see that it can\nnonetheless obscure the physics we were originally interested in finding, namely the presence\nof light LH sleptons decaying into sneutrinos. However, we will see that all of our signals\ncan in principle still be observed, even in the presence of this new SUSY background.\nNaturally, the presence of taus in almost every event could be deduced by applying\nhadronic tau tags. We expect that this will be a clear giveaway of the flavor (but not the\ncharge) of the NLSP, even if the tag is not very efficient. However, we will not rely on\nhadronic taus for detailed kinematics. Instead we focus entirely on the performance of our\nproposed multilepton measurements, which directly carry over from our RH-active analysis\nand will be quite robust independent of the hadronic tau efficiency.\n\nIV.\n\nCOLLIDER SIMULATIONS\n\nIn order to determine what these signals might look like at the LHC, we have performed\nsimulations of three sample sneutrino NLSP spectra, along with Standard Model backgrounds. The simulation and analysis methodology is identical to that in [1]. In particular,\nwe generate complete spectra, including radiative corrections, using SOFTSUSY v3.0.7 [27].\nWe generate SUSY 2 \u2192 2 pair production using MadGraph/MadEvent v4.3.0 [28]. We\n\nuse BRIDGE v2.17 [29] to calculate branching fractions and to simulate the decay chains.14\n\nWe then shower and hadronize with PYTHIA v6.4.14 [30], and perform event reconstruction with FastJet v2.3.4 [31]. As before, we do not include detector effects beyond basic\n13\n\n14\n\nIn principle, we could determine whether a lepton is prompt, versus a product of tau decay, by measuring the displacement of its track from the primary event vertex. However, the distribution of impact\nparameters is quite broad, and depends on the unknown energy of the original tau. Separation of the\nindependent dilepton distributions with and without taus may not be feasible without high statistics and\ncareful analysis.\nWe use a modified version of BRIDGE which incorporates left-right mixing effects for the light generations.\nWe are grateful to Matt Reece for his help.\n\n23\n\n\fgeometric acceptance and simple pT cuts on reconstruction.\nAfter hadronization, event reconstruction proceeds as follows. We separate out leptons\n(electrons and muons) with pT above 5 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, and check them for isolation. We\nscalar-sum the pT of the lepton with the pT s of all other non-leptonic (and non-invisible)\nparticles within an \u03b7-\u03c6 cone of size 0.4. If the lepton constitutes 90% or more of the total\npT , then we consider it \"tight.\" Failing this, if the pT of the other particles tallies to less\nthan 10 GeV, we consider it \"loose.\" (This second class of leptons will be used to keep more\nsignal in events with high lepton multiplicity, namely three or more.) We set aside leptons\nwhich fail both of these criteria for clustering into jets.\nAfter identifying the set of isolated leptons, we proceed to cluster all of the remaining\nnon-invisible particles in the event into jets using the Cambridge/Aachen algorithm with\nR = 0.4. We keep jets with pT > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5.\nWe focus exclusively on super-QCD production modes, as these are the most spectacular,\nand the most straightforward to extract from the backgrounds.15 We require that each event\nhave at least two jets with pT > 300 GeV, and 6ET > 200 GeV. We study events with at\nleast one tight lepton, with the further requirement that a second lepton be tight in events\nwith two or more leptons. These requirements very efficiently remove leptons from heavy\nflavor decay.\nBackgrounds are as before, including tt\u0304, single- and di-boson. Z/\u03b3 are treated fully offshell. We did not investigate new backgrounds relevant for 4-lepton and higher channels,\nas the 3-lepton backgrounds are already essentially negligible given our cuts on jet and 6ET\n\nactivity.16\n\nSince many of our signals will require high luminosity to achieve good statistical control,\nwe perform our analysis at 100 fb\u22121 . We optimistically assume that the LHC will be running\nat the design energy of 14 TeV by this point. A somewhat lower final operating energy will\nnot significantly change our conclusions.\n15\n\n16\n\nElectroweak production of gauginos or RH sleptons may also yield very interesting multilepton signals,\nwhich may become especially relevant for a reduced energy LHC, or for searches at the Tevatron. We\nrelegate the question of their observability for future studies.\nThe dominant 3-lepton background, with about 0.04 fb after cuts, is W Z+jets. We have included this\nin the analysis for illustration. The final sample has very low cross section per Monte Carlo event, and\nappears as a small contribution on 3-lepton plots (with fewer than one event per bin). ZZ+jets represents\nan even smaller contribution, and has not been included.\n\n24\n\n\fRH-active LR-mixed smuon NUHM\ng\u0303\n\n1403\n\n1186\n\n1034\n\n\u0169L /d \u0303L\n\n935\n\n855\n\n960\n\n\u0169R\n\n944\n\n878\n\n863\n\nd \u0303R\n\n934\n\n861\n\n938\n\nt\u03031\n\n866\n\n801\n\n672\n\nt\u03032\n\n954\n\n875\n\n921\n\nb\u03031\n\n912\n\n824\n\n881\n\nb\u03032\n\n934\n\n860\n\n927\n\n\u03c7\u030301\n\n285\n\n360\n\n182\n\n\u03c7\u030302\n\n386\n\n405\n\n340\n\n\u03c7\u030303\n\n458\n\n425\n\n544\n\n\u03c7\u030304\n\n516\n\n600\n\n561\n\n\u03c7\u0303+\n1\n\n384\n\n390\n\n341\n\n\u03c7\u0303+\n2\n\n515\n\n600\n\n564\n\n\u1ebdR\n\n254\n\n316\n\n408\n\n+\n \u0303\nlL\n\n199\n\n184\n\n153\n\n\u03bd\u0303\n\n184\n\n166\n\n131\n\n\u03bd \u0303\u03c4\n\n182\n\n166\n\n95\n\n\u03c4\u03031\n\n198\n\n174\n\n120\n\n\u03c4\u03032\n\n255\n\n320\n\n386\n\nTABLE I: Physical masses (in units of GeV) in the three example spectra.\nA.\n\nSimple RH-Active Spectrum\n\nWe start by analyzing a simple RH-active spectrum, where left-right mixing effects in the\nfirst two generations can be largely neglected, and electron-muon asymmetries are small.\nThis spectrum was simulated using the assumptions of General Gauge Mediation [7], with a\nmediation scale of 100 TeV and tan \u03b2 = 5.

Both are significantly above\nthe SM backgrounds. Unfortunately, the expectation concerning the OSSF endpoint cannot\nbe cleanly verified in this case since it falls in the bin surrounding the Z-mass, which has\nbeen intentionally blinded to avoid contamination from the possible SUSY production of\n28\n\n\fon-shell Zs. Nevertheless the shape of the distribution is clearly visible after subtraction\n(Fig. 12). Regarding the OSOF distribution, which is crucial evidence for sneutrino NLSP,\nwe can clearly identify the first peak after subtraction (Fig. 12). The second peak, however,\ncannot be clearly distinguished. The first peak also materializes in the trileptonic OFOF\nchannel (Fig. 13), albeit with rather low statistics.\nFinally, we look at the trilepton invariant mass of SFOF and SFSF dileptons (Fig. 14). If\nall three leptons were always coming from the same decay chain, corresponding to the process\nB\u0303 \u2192 \u1ebdR \u2192 B\u0303 \u2217 \u2192  \u0303l, they would reproduce, up to spin effects, the distribution depicted on\nthe right side of Fig. 14. Although realistically we have combinatorial backgrounds, as well\nas backgrounds from LH chains (which we have not subtracted, due to limited statistics), we\ncan still see clear evidence for the sharp spike. Observation of such a feature should motivate\na more detailed kinematic analysis, which in this case is quite nontrivial. (However, see [25]\nfor formulas applying to the case where the intermediate neutralino in \u1ebdR decay is on-shell.)\n\nB.\n\nRH-Active Spectrum with Flavor Non-Universal Signals due to Smuon Left-\n\nRight Mixing\n\nWe next analyze a spectrum where left-right mixing of the smuon leads to appreciably\nflavor non-universal signals. The physical spectrum appears in the second column of table I.\nThe mass gap between the RH and LH sleptons is now large enough to allow for real emission\nof electroweak gauge bosons and Higgs bosons. This spectrum was again produced using\nGeneral Gauge Mediation at a mediation scale of 100 TeV, and with tan \u03b2 = 20. The\ntotal leading-order SUSY cross section is 911 fb, of which 524 fb is from super-QCD pair\nproduction. SQCD production is again squark-dominated.\nOne additional noteworthy feature of this spectrum is that the neutralino mixing is\nnot small, and the Bino is distributed nontrivially between the first and third neutralinos.\nSpecifically, the gauge eigenstate composition of the lightest neutralino (360 GeV) is (36% B\u0303,\n4% W\u0303 , 33% H\u0303d , 27% H\u0303u ), and of the third neutralino (64% B\u0303, 5% W\u0303 , 15% H\u0303d , 17% H\u0303u ).17\nThis substantive mixing ultimately ends up having no qualitative impact on our analysis.\nThough there are now naively two Binos in the cascades, with RH squarks (of the first two\n17\n\nThe complete neutralino mixing matrix, with (B\u0303,W\u0303 ,H\u0303d ,H\u0303u ) composition running horizontally and mass\n\n29\n\n\fgenerations) decaying 40/60% of the time into the first/third state, the subsequent decays\nof the lightest neutralino are highly biased towards invisible \u03bd \u03bd\u0303 modes due to Wino-Bino\ninterference combined with small phase space for l\u1ebdR . Effectively, then, there is only one\nBino (\u03c7\u030303 ), and it is produced with a somewhat attenuated rate. This kind of situation is of\ncourse not required to achieve large electron-muon asymmetries, but it illustrates that our\nsignals can actually be quite robust against neutralino mixing, despite the fact that most of\nour discussions above (and in [1]) used a simplified picture with pure gauge eigenstates.\nWe see from Figs. 15 and 16 that the lepton counting in this spectrum, neglecting detailed\nelectron and muon composition, is similar to the simple RH-active spectrum. In the invariant\nmass distributions, we expect to see following kinematic features:\n\u2022 B\u0303(\u03c7\u030303 ) \u2192 \u1ebdR \u2192 \u03bd\u0303: a bump in the OSSF-OSOF subtraction with endpoint at 147 GeV\n(peak near 75 GeV),\n\u2022 B\u0303(\u03c7\u030303 ) \u2192  \u0303l \u2192 \u03bd\u0303: a bump in the OSOF-SSOF subtraction peaked at 65 GeV,\n\u2022 W\u0303 0 (\u03c7\u030304 ) \u2192  \u0303l \u2192 \u03bd\u0303: a bump in the OSOF-SSOF subtraction peaked at 120 GeV.\nThe first two of these predictions are indeed observed (Figs. 17 and 18), though statistics\nare somewhat limited.\nThe most striking new feature of this spectrum is the strong electron-muon asymmetry,\noriginating from the very different decays of RH selectrons and RH smuons. While the former almost exclusively undergoes the usual 3-body decays mediated by off-shell neutralinos\n(contributing to the OSSF dilepton excess), the latter can mix into a LH smuon and emit\nan electroweak gauge boson, or emit a Higgs boson directly through the Yukawa coupling\n(subsection II C). Indeed, we find that 2-body electroweak modes account for approximately\n95% of the decays of the RH smuon in this spectrum, with 63% going through W , and 16%\neach through Z and h. We present simple counting measures of the asymmetry in dileptonic\nOSSF and trileptonic SFOF+SFSF in Fig. 19.

Multilepton counting, using a logarithmic scale.\n\nproduction is now not so obvious from simple counting in sign/flavor channels (Fig. 22).\nIndeed, up to some small hint of flavor correlation, the latter appears quite consistent with\nthe simplest sneutrino NLSP spectra. However, the high multiplicity is already a clear\ngiveaway that there is more going on.\nMuch more can be inferred from the detailed invariant mass distributions. Given this\nspectrum, we expect to see following kinematic features in dileptons:\n\u2022 B\u0303(\u03c7\u030301 ) \u2192  \u0303l \u2192 \u03bd\u0303\u03c4 : a bump in the OSSF-OSOF subtraction peaked near 77 GeV,\n\u2022 W\u0303 0 (\u03c7\u030302 ) \u2192  \u0303l \u2192 \u03bd\u0303\u03c4 : a bump in the OSSF-OSOF subtraction peaked near 115 GeV,\n\u2022 B\u0303(\u03c7\u030301 ) \u2192  \u0303l \u2192 \u03bd\u0303e,\u03bc : a bump in the OSOF-SSOF subtraction peaked at 25 GeV,\n\u2022 W\u0303 0 (\u03c7\u030302 ) \u2192  \u0303l \u2192 \u03bd\u0303e,\u03bc : a bump in the OSOF-SSOF subtraction peaked at 75 GeV.\nWhen we take the distributions (Fig. 23) and perform the subtractions (Fig. 24), we see\ndistributions consistent with the presence of these features. But, as discussed in subsection III E, there is also a significant OS contamination from leptonic tau decays. This\nappears in the right panel of Fig. 24 as a high rate in the lowest mass bin, representing\nan unresolved falling distribution. Disentangling this from the first slepton/sneutrino bump\nmight be feasible with higher statistics, and the second bump is already almost well-resolved.\nThe presence of such nontrivial structures in the subtracted mass distribution is highly suggestive of the participation of sleptons and sneutrinos of the first two generations. However,\nthe evidence is clearly not as clean compared to the cases without significant tau production.\n34\n\n\f# events (100 fb-1)\n\n# events (100 fb-1)\n\nSUSY signal\n\u03c4 \u03c4 +jets\ndilep tt\ndilep WW+jets\nWll+jets\nsemilep tt\nsemilep WW+jets\nW+jets\n\n1600\n1400\n1200\n\n500\n\nSUSY signal\n\u03c4\u03c4 +jets\ndilep tt\ndilep WW+jets\nWll+jets\nsemilep tt\nsemilep WW+jets\nW+jets\n\n400\n\n300\n\n1000\n800\n\n200\n600\n400\n\n100\n\n200\n0\n\nOSOF\n\nOSSF\n\nSSOF\n\n0\n\nSSSF\n\nSS\n\nOFOF\n\nSFOF\n\n3l channel\n\nSFSF\n\n3l channel\n\nFIG. 22: (NUHM spectrum.)

Dilepton invariant mass distributions applying the OSSF-OSOF subtraction (left) and OSOF-SSOF subtraction (right). Backgrounds are included in the subtractions.\nThe continuous gray histogram is background-only.\n\n\u2022 spectra of this type where the RH smuon predominantly undergoes electroweak decays\nvia left-right mixing,\n\u2022 spectra where the LH stau doublet is appreciably lower in mass than the other LH\nsleptons.\nThe immediate signals of these spectra are high rates for multileptons, with reasonable\nchance to observe up to 6-lepton events in a 100 fb\u22121 run of the LHC. Beyond this, we can\nidentify some general features of the dileptonic and trileptonic invariant mass distributions,\nwhich allow us to extract kinematic information. Dileptons will contain independent excesses\nfrom the production/decay of both LH and RH sleptons, the former equally distributed\nbetween OSSF and OSOF channels, and the latter contained exclusively in OSSF. Together,\nthese will appear as mismatched OSSF and OSOF excesses, from which we can extract the\nindividual distributions by judicious subtractions. Backgrounds are non-negligible but in\nprinciple manageable. The same distributions will also exist in the trilepton channels, along\nwith a potentially observable excess in the trilepton invariant mass. Here, the backgrounds\nare almost purely combinatorial and supersymmetric in origin.\nIn the spectra where electroweak decays dominate for the RH smuon, the multilepton\nsignals can display substantial asymmetries between e and \u03bc. If such signals were observed\nat the LHC, they might initially be interpreted as large flavor violation in the soft terms\n36\n\n\fof the first two generations, such as in [20]. Amusingly, though, these large effects on the\nflavor structure of the events actually originate directly from the ordinary electron and muon\nYukawa couplings, appropriately supersymmetrized.\nSpectra with a highly split-off stau doublet will look quite similar to more flavordegenerate spectra with RH sleptons participating, though with a fairly prominent low-mass\nOS dilepton feature from leptonically decaying taus. This would be in addition to the fact\nthat most events could be tagged with at least one hadronic tau.\nWe have seen that these three classes of spectra would be hard to miss at the LHC, and\nthat they would support a large number of independent multilepton analyses. But, if we\nassume that such signals are supersymmetric in origin, how do we ultimately know that they\nare indicating the presence of a sneutrino NLSP? The irony of these scenarios is that while\nthe high leptonic rates make them easy to discover, they also tend to obscure the detailed\nspectral structure in a pileup of overlapping signals from different sub-cascades. Still, the\nsituation remains simple enough in the dileptonic and trileptonic channels to largely infer\nwhat is happening.\nIn our first paper, we advocated independent identification of a flavor-blind OS excess\nin the dileptonic invariant mass distributions within both the dilepton and trilepton channels. The trilepton analysis provided a powerful cross-check of the much more backgroundcontaminated dileptonic analysis. We can still apply the same methodology here, but we\nmust restrict ourselves to the OSOF channel since the OSSF contribution appears in superposition with the signal from the RH cascades. While it will no longer be straightforward\nto directly see that the OSOF signal is indeed half of a flavor-blind OS signal, this remains\na very reasonable first assumption. In any case, as we have argued in [1], it does not seem\nstraightforward to engineer such a large OSOF excess within the MSSM. Naively the easiest way to do this is to introduce a large population of OSSF taus from stau production\nand decay, and these will sometimes both decay into (flavor-uncorrelated) leptons. But this\nkind of scenario could be inferred in two ways: the invariant mass distribution would tend\nto be skewed towards lower masses due to the energy sharing with neutrinos, and there\nwould necessarily be a high rate of hadronic tau production, which could be independently\nobserved. We would therefore propose that the observation of the OSOF-SSOF signal with\na well-localized invariant mass bump (or bumps), in combination with all of the other multileptonic activity, and with a modest rate for hadronic tau detection, makes the sneutrino\n37\n\n\fNLSP interpretation highly attractive.\nOf course, arguing this case is more subtle for the NUHM-type spectra with light stau\ndoublet, where genuine OS dileptons coexist with high production rates for taus. In fact,\nwe saw there that the enhanced tau production directly led to a substantial contribution\nto OSOF. Still, there is hope that the prompt OSOF dileptons will have a distinct enough\ndistribution to ultimately stand out against the low-mass tau shape. Even if this is not so\nclean, the complete set of signals would still be quite consistent with a tau-sneutrino NLSP.\nIn a broader context, it is clear that we have found some very distinctive new phenomenology within the MSSM. These signals have been largely overlooked in the past, partly because sneutrino NLSP spectra do not readily appear in canonical UV mediation scenarios,\nand partly because there has been little pressure to model-build from the dark matter perspective. However, there is obviously a benefit in exploring a more flexible approach to\nthe MSSM, especially given our near-ignorance of physics beyond even a few hundred GeV.\nConversely, should our signals be discovered in the coming years, they would indicate a\nSUSY mediation scenario quite distinct from what is typically imagined.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to Kaustubh Agashe, Maxim Perelstein, Yael Shadmi and especially Matt\nReece for discussions and help with the BRIDGE program.

These can become the dominant modes when the charginos and neutralinos are all\n+ 0\nheavier, so that 2-body modes \u1ebd+\nR \u2192 eR \u03c7\u0303 (e.g., into mostly-Wino via gaugino mixing) are\n\ncut off. They will compete with the modes induced by left-right mixing, as discussed in\nsubsection II C.\n+ +  \u0303\u2212\nThere are two types of 3-body processes: \u1ebd+\nR \u2192 eR lL lL proceeding via a chirality-\n\n38\n\n\f+ \u2212  \u0303+\npreserving B\u0303 propagator, and \u1ebd+\nR \u2192 eR lL lL proceeding via a chirality-flipping B\u0303 propagator.\n\nThe general expressions for the widths of these decays depend on the three parameters m\u1ebd ,\nml\u0303 , and mB\u0303 , and are somewhat awkward. We also include the limits where (m\u1ebd \u2212 ml\u0303 ) \u2192 0\nor ml\u0303 \u2192 0, namely where the slepton is respectively nonrelativistic (NR) or ultrarelativistic\n(UR) in the \u1ebdR rest frame. We also display the mB\u0303 \u226b m\u1ebd limit (non-propagating Bino) for\nthe decays, since the expressions significantly simplify.\n+\nThere are also the equivalent processes with l replaced by \u03bd: \u1ebd+\nR \u2192 eR \u03bd\u0304 \u03bd\u0303 proceeding via\n\n+\n\u2217\na chirality-preserving B\u0303 propagator, and \u1ebd+\nR \u2192 eR \u03bd \u03bd\u0303 proceeding via a chirality-flipping B\u0303\n\npropagator. The expressions are identical, up to the obvious replacement ml\u0303 \u2192 m\u03bd\u0303 .\nWe ignore gaugino mixing effects, treating the Bino as a pure mass state. Extending the\nformulas to a mixed neutralino is straightforward.\ng1 stands for the U(1)Y coupling (g1 \u2243 0.37), and Yi stands for the hypercharge (Y\u1ebd = 1\nand Yl\u0303 = \u22121/2).\n\n39\n\n\f+ +  \u0303\u2212\n\u0393(\u1ebd+\nR \u2192 eR lL lL ) (chirality-preserving):\n\n(A1)\n\n!\n\"\n\u0001\n1\nm2\u1ebd\n2\n2\n2\n4\n2 2\n2\n2\n2\n4 4\n+\nmB\u0303 (m\u1ebd \u2212 ml\u0303 ) 6mB\u0303 + 2m\u1ebd ml\u0303 \u2212 5mB\u0303 (m\u1ebd + ml\u0303 ) + 2m\u1ebd ml\u0303 log\nFull =\n28 \u03c0 3 m4B\u0303 m\u1ebd3\nm2l\u0303\n!#\n2\n2\nm\n\u2212\nm\n\u0001\n\u1ebd\nB\u0303\n2(m2B\u0303 \u2212 m2l\u0303 ) 3m6B\u0303 + m2B\u0303 m\u1ebd4 + m4\u1ebd m2l\u0303 \u2212 m4B\u0303 (4m2\u1ebd + m2l\u0303 ) log\nm2B\u0303 \u2212 m2l\u0303\n\"\nY\u1ebd2 Yl\u03032 g14 m\u1ebd\n\u0001\nm\u1ebd \u2212 ml\u0303\n2\n3(m2B\u0303 \u2212 m2\u1ebd )2 + 6(m2B\u0303 \u2212 m2\u1ebd )m\u1ebd (m\u1ebd \u2212 ml\u0303 ) + m\u1ebd2 (m\u1ebd \u2212 ml\u0303 )2 \u2212\nNR =\n4\n5\n3\n3 * 2 \u03c0 ml\u0303\nm\u1ebd\nY\u1ebd2 Yl\u03032 g14\n\nm2B\u0303 \u2212 m\u1ebd2\n\n\u0001\n(m2B\u0303 \u2212 m\u1ebd2 )2 + 3(m2B\u0303 \u2212 m2\u1ebd )m\u1ebd (m\u1ebd \u2212 ml\u0303 ) + 2m\u1ebd2 (m\u1ebd \u2212 ml\u0303 )2 \u00d7\n!#\n2m\u1ebd (m\u1ebd \u2212 ml\u0303 )\nlog 1 +\nm2B\u0303 \u2212 m\u1ebd2\n\n3\n\nm\u1ebd5\n\nY\u1ebd2 Yl\u03032 g14 (m\u1ebd \u2212 ml\u0303 )5 m\u1ebd\n15 * 23 \u03c0 3 (m2B\u0303 \u2212 m\u1ebd2 )2 ml\u0303\n\"\n!\n!#\nm2B\u0303\nm4B\u0303\nm2B\u0303\nY\u1ebd2 Yl\u03032 g14\nm\u1ebd2\nm\u1ebd 6 2 \u2212 5 + 2 3 4 \u2212 4 2 + 1 log 1 \u2212 2\nUR =\n28 \u03c0 3\nm\u1ebd\nm\u1ebd\nm\u1ebd\nmB\u0303\n\u2192\n\n\u2192\n\nY\u1ebd2 Yl\u03032 g14 m\u1ebd5\n3 * 29 \u03c0 3 m4B\u0303\n\n+ \u2212  \u0303+\n\u0393(\u1ebd+\nR \u2192 eR lL lL ) (chirality-flipping):\n\n(A2)\n\n\"\n\u0001\n1\nFull =\nm2B\u0303 (m\u1ebd2 \u2212 m2l\u0303 ) 2m4B\u0303 + 2m\u1ebd2 m2l\u0303 \u2212 m2B\u0303 (m2\u1ebd + m2l\u0303 ) +\n27 \u03c0 3 m4B\u0303 m\u1ebd3\n!\n\u0001\nm2\u1ebd\n2\n2\n2\n2 2\n2 2\n+\n2m\u1ebd ml\u0303 m\u1ebd ml\u0303 \u2212 mB\u0303 (m\u1ebd + ml\u0303 ) log\nm2l\u0303\n!#\n2\n2\nm\n\u2212\nm\n\u1ebd\nB\u0303\n2(m2B\u0303 \u2212 m2\u1ebd )(m2B\u0303 \u2212 m2l\u0303 )(m4B\u0303 \u2212 m\u1ebd2 m2l\u0303 ) log\nm2B\u0303 \u2212 m2l\u0303\nY\u1ebd2 Yl\u03032 g14\n\nm2B\u0303\n\n+ + \u2212\n\u0393(\u1ebd+\nR \u2192 eR lL l\u0303L )NR\n\"\nY\u1ebd2 Yl\u03032 g14 m2B\u0303\nm\u1ebd2\n2\n\u2212\n+2\nUR =\n27 \u03c0 3 m\u1ebd\nm2B\u0303\n\nNR =\n\n\u2192\n\nm2\u1ebd\n\nm2B\u0303\n\n!\n\nm2\n\u2212 1 log 1 \u2212 2\u1ebd\n2\nm\u1ebd\nmB\u0303\n\nY\u1ebd2 Yl\u03032 g14 m\u1ebd3\n3 * 27 \u03c0 3 m2B\u0303\n\n40\n\n!#\n\n\f[1] A.
