Introduction\nThe nucleus of a galaxy is usually deeply embedded in\ndust and can therefore only be probed by infrared (IR)\nobservations. In this paper, we present an infrared polarisation and a spectro\u2013photometric study of the starburst\ngalaxy NGC1808. The new data are explained by a consistent model for grain heating and cooling. We include a\ndiscussion of the various infrared emission bands (IEB).\nUnderstanding the mid IR emission is of particular interest since the ratio of mid IR over total luminosity is a\ndiagnostic for estimating the relative contribution of starburst versus AGN activity (Rigopoulou et al. 1999, Clavel\net al. 2000).\nAnother important and so far unanswered question is\nhow much of the galactic infrared emission is polarised.\nThe observed emission in galaxies is always averaged\nSend offprint requests to: rsiebenm@eso.org\n\u22c6\nBased on observations with ISO (Kessler et al. 1996), an\nESA project with instruments funded by ESA Member States\n(especially the PI countries: France, Germany, the Netherlands\nand the United Kingdom) with the participation of ISAS and\nNASA.\n\nover a large volume and, in case polarisation is detected,\nshould be linked to large scale alignment of the dust.\nPolarised emission from interstellar grains can only be\ndetected at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths and\nhas been observed in various galactic sources, such as\nthe Galactic Centre (Hildebrand 1989), molecular clouds\n(Novak et al. 1989, Clemens et al. 1999), star forming regions (Gonatas et al. 1990, Leach et al. 1991, Smith et\nal. 2000), protostars (Siebenmorgen & Kr\u00fcgel 2000) and\nprestellar cores (Minchin et al. 1995, Ward-Thompson et\nal. 2000), and in the nucleus of the starburst galaxy M82\n(Greaves et al. 2000).\nThe galaxy NGC1808 is at a distance of 11.1 Mpc\n(Reif et al. 1982), where 1\u2032\u2032 corresponds to 53 pc. It is\nclassified as type Sbc (Sandage & Tammann 1987) and\nseen fairly edge\u2013on. The moderate far IR luminosity of a\nfew 1010 L\u2299 is ascribed by Krabbe et al. (1994) to young\nstars formed in recent star formation. For the central\n1.5 kpc, Koribalski et al. (1993) suggest a total gas mass\n(HI plus molecular gas) of 4.2\u00d7109 M\u2299 , and Dahlem et\nal. (1990) propose 2\u00d7109 M\u2299 of molecular gas. In the optical, NGC1808 reveals a disk with outer spiral arms. Dust\nfilaments are seen in the North\u2013East and seem to emerge\n\n\f2\n\nR. Siebenmorgen et al.: The Infrared Continuum Radiation of NGC1808\n\nfrom the nucleus (Veron\u2013Cetty & Veron 1985). There is\nevidence of a central bar of 500 pc length, an inner ring\u2013\nlike structure (Tacconi-Garman et al. 1996), and a number\nof compact radio (Saikia et al. 1990) as well as near IR\nsources (Kotilainen et al. 1996).\nIn Sect. 2, we present the observations followed by a\ndiscussion of the infrared polarisation (Sect. 3). A model\nfor astronomical PAHs is outlined in Sect. 4. The infrared\nspectral energy distribution is first discussed assuming optically thin emission (Sect. 5); the model is refined in\nSect. 6 to include proper radiative transfer. Results are\nsummarised in Sect. 7.\n\n2. Observations\nISOCAM (Cesarsky et al. 1996) polarimetric imaging on\nNGC1808 was set up according to the observing template\nCAM05 (Siebenmorgen et al. 1996). The corresponding\nISO observation numbers, TDT, are: 87501602, 87501703,\n87501804, 87501905, 87502006, 87502107 and 87502208.\nWe used the 6\u03bcm filter lw4 and a 3\u00d73 raster with a raster\nstep size of 39\u2032\u2032 and the 3\u2032\u2032 lens. The read out time of each\nexposure was 2.1s. After a background measurement, we\ntook 15 exposures on the source to stabilize the detector and then a raster through the free hole of the entrance wheel. At each raster position 15 exposures were\nread out. This procedure was carried out for each of the\nthree polarisers. The polariser rasters were repeated in 2\ncycles. The data were reduced with the ISOCAM interactive analysis system (CIA version 4.0, Ott et al. 1996).\nOnly basic reduction steps, such as dark current subtraction, removal of cosmic ray hits or transient correction, are\napplied to the data. They are described together with calibration uncertainties in Siebenmorgen et al. (2000). The\ncoadded images at each raster position were projected on\nthe sky and corrected for field distortion to derive the final mosaics. The mosaics have a 168\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 168\u2032\u2032 total field of\nview and a pixel scale of 1\u2032\u2032 . The polarised signal is found\nto be consistent between the cycles, and the average of all\ncycles gives the final mosaic image for each polariser. Our\npolarisation image is shown in Fig. 1 after correction for\ninstrumental polarisation (Siebenmorgen 1999).\nFrom the ISO archive we retrieved spectro\u2013\nphotometric\u2013imaging data taken with the circular\nvariable filter (CVF) of ISOCAM (TDT: 69702381).\nFor each CVF step between 16.33\u03bcm down to 5.14\u03bcm,\n11 exposures of 2.1 s integration time using the 3\u2032\u2032 lens\nwere read out (Siebenmorgen et al. 2000, for more information on ISOCAM data handling). After background\nsubtraction, we simulate multi\u2013aperture photometry on\nthe images. The spectrum, as derived for a 25\u2032\u2032 aperture\ncentred on the brightest pixel, is shown in Fig. 4 and\nFig. 5. One notices strong IEBs centered at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6,\n11.3 and 12.8 \u03bcm. There is a weaker but definite broad\nband emission feature centered at 7.0\u03bcm. A detection of\nthe 7.0\u03bcm band is reported for HD9730 by Siebenmorgen\net al. (1998) and in other galaxies by Helou et al. (2000).\nIn addition there is a plateau of fainter bands beyond\n\nFig. 1. Polarisation image of NGC1808 at 6\u03bcm (ISOCAM\nfilter lw4). The observed E\u2013vectors and the contours of the\ntotal emission are shown in detector coordinates. The celestial North-East orientation is indicated. Contours range\nfrom 1.28 to 8.21 in steps of 0.77 mJy/arcsec2. The effective resolution is 5\u2032\u2032 .\n13\u03bcm and most likely we see the rise towards the 16.4\n\u03bcm band (Moutou et al. 2000), which is just outside the\nscanned wavelength region. Below we combine the main\nbands as well as the fainter bands and newly discovered\nIEBs with measured laboratory modes of polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and present quantitative\nmodel fits.\nLinear polarisation at 170 \u03bcm was detected with the\nISOPHT C200 2\u00d72 array (Lemke et al. 1996) by measuring several cycles with the 0\u25e6 , 120\u25e6 and 240\u25e6 polarisers\n(TDT: 85601702, 85601803, 85601904 and 85602005). The\ncycles were followed by an open (sky) measurement and\none of the internal reference calibrators (Klaas et al. 1999).\nWe commanded 4 pointings such that each of the 4 detector pixels measured the polarisation of the centre position\nof the galaxy in succession. In addition, the observations\non the source were bracketed by two background observations to determine the zero signal level and to monitor\ninstrumental variations. The sky measurements were processed and calibrated using the standard procedures for\nphotometry (Laureijs et al. 2000) with the ISOPHT interactive analysis software (PIA version 8.1). After coaddition of the 4 pointings of the C200 array, we obtained a\nsmall map which indicated that the brightness distribution\nof the galaxy is not significantly different from that of a\npoint source. We conclude that NGC1808 is not resolved\nwith ISOPHT at 170 \u03bcm. The galaxy is much brighter\nthan the background and has a flux F170\u03bcm = 104\u00b110 Jy,\nmost of which comes from the central pixel. The estimated\n\n\fR. Siebenmorgen et al.: The Infrared Continuum Radiation of NGC1808\n\nerror of 10% is based on the ISOPHT absolute photometric calibration uncertainty.\nSince the galaxy is a point source at 170\u03bcm, we determined the polarisation only for the four pixel\u2013position\ncombinations centred on the galaxy. The polarisation measurements of the other positions in the map were not used\nas they were pointing on the wings of the beam profile of\nthe galaxy. Due to the uncertainties in the beam profiles\nof each detector pixel, we are not sure whether our values\nfor instrumental polarisation apply to measurements for\nwhich the detector pixel is not centred on the (polarised)\npoint source. The processing of the signals were carried\nout according to the procedure described in Laureijs &\nKlaas (1999); we also used their instrumental polarisation\nvalues. The resulting fractional polarisation degree (p) and\npolarisation angle (\u03b8) with respect to the equatorial North\nper C200 detector pixel are presented in Table 2. The polarisation vector obtained from pixel 3 is significantly different from the other pixels and has a somewhat lower\naccuracy. The last line in Table 2 gives the polarisation\nderived from the average of the Stokes vectors of all pixels\nafter subtraction of the instrumental polarisation. We did\nnot include possible systematic uncertainties introduced\nby the instrumental polarisation of the pixels. We estimate\nthat they amount to less than 1% in the final polarisation\ndegree.\nTable 1. Polarisation of the centre position of NGC1808\nat 170\u03bcm for each pixel of the ISOPHT C200 array.

First estimates\nAs the source is not resolved by ISO at 170\u03bcm, its\nfar IR size must be smaller than the diameter of the\nfirst Airy ring (140\u2032\u2032 ). Scans at 100\u03bcm from the KAO\n(Smith & Harvey, 1996) indicate a maximum source size\nof \u0398source = 36\u2032\u2032 compatible with the maps at 6\u03bcm (this\npaper), and at 8.4 GHz and in Br\u03b3 (Kotilainen et al. 1996).\nTo get an estimate of the average optical depth, we put\nF170\u03bcm = \u03a9 * B170\u03bcm (T ) * \u03c4170\u03bcm and assume homogeneously distributed dust within \u03a9 = 2.39 * 10\u22128 steradian\nand at temperature of 33K, as is typical for starburst\ngalaxies (Siebenmorgen et al. 1999). In this way, one gets\n\u03c4170\u03bcm \u2264 6.5 * 10\u22123 in rough agreement with the estimate\nby Smith & Harvey (1996). By applying a standard dust\nmodel (Kr\u00fcgel & Siebenmorgen 1994b), this translates\n\n3\n\ninto a visual optical depth \u03c4V \u223c 2000 * \u03c4170\u03bcm \u2264 13 or\n\u03c46\u03bcm \u223c \u03c4V /60 \u2264 0.2.\nThe fractional polarisation p170\u03bcm = 2.5\u00b10.4% implies\na total polarised flux of \u223c 2.5 Jy. The extrapolation of the\n(non\u2013thermal) 20 cm radio flux of 520 \u00b1 10 mJy with a\n\u03bd \u22120.7 \u2013law to 170\u03bcm gives only 4 mJy. Therefore the far IR\npolarisation of NGC1808 cannot contain any synchrotron\ncontribution, but must be entirely due to thermal emission\nfrom dust grains aligned by a magnetic field.\nThe polarisation angle \u03b8170\u03bcm = 94\u25e6 \u00b1 5\u25e6 indicates\nthe direction of the E\u2013vector, which is perpendicular to\nthe interstellar magnetic field. This result differs from\nthe strength and field direction derived from the non\u2013\nthermal radio emission. Averaging the central 90\u2032\u2032 of the\n6 cm map by Dahlem et al. (1990), the angles differ by almost 70\u25e6 . However, both observations may probe regions\nin the galaxy at different vertical heights where the magnetic field has a different horizontal component. A good\nexample for such a case is presented by M 51 (Fig.1 of\nBerkhuijsen et al. 1996).\nOur 6\u03bcm ISOCAM map of NGC1808 also depicts the\ncentral region. Its size down to the lowest contours equals\n23\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 15\u2032\u2032 and the integrated flux is 1130 \u00b1 60 mJy. A comparison with the Br \u03b3 emission (Kotilainen et al. 1996),\nwhich follows the OB stars, shows that we also trace the\nstarburst at 6\u03bcm. The starburst occurs mainly along the\nmajor axis of Fig. 1. Polarisation was also detected in the\nISOCAM map. The polarisation is strongest (up to 20%)\nin the outer regions and weak in the centre of the starburst. Along the major axis and the central region of the\ngalaxy where the Br\u03b3 emission and the near IR and radio\nhot spots are concentrated, the degree of polarisation is\nquite small. Because the E\u2013vectors have a uniform direction over distances of 10\u2032\u2032 , which is greater than the instrumental angular resolution, the field itself must be ordered\nover such a scale, corresponding to 500pc or more.\nExtrapolating the 20 cm total radio flux towards the\nmid IR, we can exclude any net polarisation from non\u2013\nthermal emission. When we integrate at 6\u03bcm over the\nwhole nucleus, we do not detect any net polarisation, but\nobtain only a 3\u03c3 upper limit of 5%.\nIn the optical (V band), the degree of polarisation\namounts to a few percent (Scarrot et al. 1993), which is\nmuch smaller than in the mid IR. The polarisation vectors\nat V are quite regular and lie perpendicular to the radial\nvectors towards the center of the galaxy. In the inner part\n(750pc) of the galaxy, the polarisation is reminiscent of a\nreflection pattern powered by the nucleus.\nThe mid IR polarisation, on the other hand, is also\nfairly regular, but neither circular nor centre\u2013symmetric.\nThis argues against scattered light from the galactic nucleus. Moreover, the grains are tiny compared to the wavelength so that their scattering cross section must be very\nsmall. Therefore, the mid IR polarisation mechanism is\ndifferent from the optical and is either caused by extinction or emission of aligned dust. In any case, some of the\ninterstellar grains must be elongated and aligned, a requirement not necessary for polarisation by scattering.\n\n\f4\n\nR.

(1996) and Pauzat et al. (1997).\n\nIf the 6\u03bcm polarisation at a 10% level or more is due to\nextinction, the associated optical depth at 6\u03bcm must be\ngreater than unity (Siebenmorgen & Kr\u00fcgel 2000, Fig. 11)\nand four or more at 10\u03bcm. This would imply a very strong\nsilicate absorption feature which is not seen. We therefore\nfavor the idea that the polarisation is due to grain emission, as in the far IR. Note that the B\u2013vectors of the\naligning field for the two scenarios are perpendicular to\neach other.\nThe polarised mid IR emission of the dust must have one\nof the following origins:\n1. It may come from PAHs heated by the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) in the galactic nucleus (which is certainly\nmuch stronger than the ISRF near the sun). Indeed, our\nISOCAM mid IR spectrum (Figs. 4 and 5) shows strong\nIEBs. The orientation of a PAH along an interstellar magnetic field works only if it has a magnetic moment and if\nthe timescale for alignment is smaller than for disorder.\nAlthough carbon and hydrogen atoms are not paramagnetic, Rouan et al. (1992) propose a number of alternative ways how to endow PAHs with a magnetic moment.\nHowever, their conclusion is that PAHs, whether ionized\nor not, cannot align. Therefore we do not favour PAHs to\nproduce the observed polarisation.\n\n2. Small silicates are paramagnetic and consequently could\nalign. But to account for the polarisation they must also\ncontribute sufficiently to the emitted flux. Calculation\nof the emission from various types of transiently heated\ngrains in reflection nebulae (Siebenmorgen et al. 1992,\n1998; Li & Draine 2001b) show that small silicates are\nnot efficient radiators at 6\u03bcm.\n3. Large grains with sizes a \u2265 100 \u00c5, must have temperatures above \u223c200 K to emit substantially at 6\u03bcm. The\nheating by the ISRF is insufficient and the only possibility for them to get so hot is close to OB stars (in so called\nhot spots, see Fig. 6 and Sect. 6). Large grains are our\nfavored alternative.\n\n4. The dust model\n4.1. Large and small grains\nThe dust model adopted in the following two sections consists of amorphous carbon particles (abundance in solid\n[C]/[H] = 2.9 * 10\u22124 ) and silicates ([Si]/[H] = 3 * 10\u22125 )\nwith bulk density 2.5 g/cm3 . Their radii range from 100 to\n2400 \u00c5 with an a\u22123.5 size distribution (Mathis et al. 1977).\nAbsorption and scattering cross sections are calculated\nfrom Mie theory employing optical constants from Zubko\n\n\fR. Siebenmorgen et al.: The Infrared Continuum Radiation of NGC1808\n\n5\n\nFig. 2. Infrared absorption coefficient \u03ba\u03bb of astronomical PAH. There are two populations, one with NC = 30 C\natoms, the other with NC = 500. Both populations have an hydrogenation parameter fH/C =0.2 and an abundance\nsuch that for 105 protons in the gas phase one finds one carbon atom in each PAH population (see also Table 2).\net al. (1996) for amorphous carbon and Laor & Draine\n(1993) for silicates.\nThere is another dust population of very small\ngraphites and very small silicates with radii 5 \u00c5\u2264 a \u226480 \u00c5\nand size distribution n(a) \u221d a\u22124 whose temperatures fluctuate. Cross sections are again from Mie theory, optical\nconstants for graphites come from Draine & Lee (1984).\nThe abundances of the small graphite and small silicate\ngrains are typically 5\u201310% that of the large carbon and\nlarge silicate grains. The assumed abundances imply a\ngas\u2013to\u2013dust mass ratio of \u223c140.\n\n4.2. Astronomical PAH\nFor simplicity, we consider only two kinds of PAHs: small\nones with NC = 30 carbon atoms and big ones with NC =\n500. Both have a hydrogenation parameter, which is the\nratio of hydrogenation to carbon atoms, of fH/C = 0.2\nand a carbon abundance of YCPAH = 3% relative to the big\ngrains. We calculate absorption cross sections in the UV\nand visible following Schutte et al. (1993) and disregard\nthe differences between neutral ond ionized PAH species\n(De Frees et al. 1993, Onaka et al. 1999, 2000, Chan et\nal. 2000, Uchida et al. 2000). For the infrared emission\n\nbands of the C\u2013H and C\u2013C vibrational modes we assume\nLorentzian profiles:\n\u03c3\u03bd = N * \u03c3int\n\n\u03b3\u03bd 2\n\u03bd02\n,\n* 2 2\n2\nc \u03c0 (\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0 )2 + (\u03b3\u03bd/2)2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the damping constant, \u03c3int the integrated\ncross section and N the number of carbon or hydrogen\natoms of the PAH in the particular band at center frequency \u03bd0 . Model parameters of the PAH resonances are\nlisted in Table 2. Altogether, we consider 17 PAH bands\nmost of which are actually detected in NGC1808, except\nthe one at 3.3\u03bcm and those whose center wavelength is\ngreater than 16.3\u03bcm.\nThe assignment of the feature at 7\u03bcm is unclear, it\ncould either be a C\u2013C stretch or due to C\u2013H (Allamandola\net al. 1989). There may also be some blending with gas\nemission lines (e.g. [Ar II] line at 6.983 \u03bcm) which cannot be resolved with the CVF. The bands with 13.6 \u03bcm\n\u2264 \u03bb0 \u2264 16.3 \u03bcm are seen for the first time in an extragalactic object, but are known from Milky Way sources\n(Van Kerckhoven et al. 2000, Moutou et al. 2000, Hony et\nal. 2001).\nIn the far IR, properties of PAHs are not well constrained and we assume the continuum to fall off proportional to \u03bb\u22121.2 for \u03bb \u2265 24\u03bcm.

They lie within the\nrange of lab measurements (Moutou et al. 1996, Pauzat et\nal. 1997, Schutte et al. 1993) and they may be compared to\nother models, for example, by Li & Draine (2001). Fig. 3\nshows the contribution of the dust populations to the total\nabsorption cross.\n\n5. An optically thin model\nAs a first attempt, we model the spectral energy distribution of NGC1808 under the assumption that the emission\nis optically thin and the dust mixture is exposed to diluted\nblack\u2013body radiation of mean intensity\nJ\u03bd = a * B\u03bd (T )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the dilution factor, a, is a free parameter. The\ntemperature T reflects the effective temperature of the\nstellar population in the nucleus; we use T = 20000 K. In\nthe model depicted in Fig. 4, a = 2.2*10\u221215 . In this model,\nwe have slightly modified a few integrated cross sections\nof the PAHs with respect to the numbers of column (3)\n\nin Table 2, but never more than 30%. The total gas mass,\nemploying the abundances of the dust components as described above, equals Mgas = 4 * 109 M\u2299 .\nOverall the fit to the data in Fig. 4 is good and for the\nPAH bands even excellent. A deficit of the model around\n5.7\u03bcm could possibly be due to yet unresolved band emission. Such a band is apparent in other spectra, for example, of the Orion bar and BD+30 3639 (Fig.10 by Schutte\net al. 1993). The 5.2\u03bcm is not well constrained by the data.\nThe 7.0\u03bcm IEB is detected. We point out the blending of\nthe 12.0 \u03bcm PAH band with the adjacent main features.\nIn the optically thin model, the 6\u03bcm radiation, which is\nfurther investigated in our polarisation study, is due to\nPAHs.\n\n6.

Such a model gives\na good match to the CVF and far IR data, however,\n1. it cannot account for the 25\u03bcm emission;\n2. it gives no information of the structure within the nucleus nor on the observed IR sizes;\n3. it incorrectly assumes zero optical depth within the\nnucleus;\n4. its 6\u03bcm emission is due to PAHs. As PAHs are unlikely\nto be good polarisers, this is in contradiction to our IR\npolarimetric results.\nWe therefore include the effects of radiative transfer\nin the nucleus of the galaxy. Such computations have\nbeen carried out in various approximations by a number of authors (Rowan-Robinson & Crawford 1989, Pier\n& Krolik 1993, Granato & Danese 1994, Efstathiou &\nSiebenmorgen 1995, Silva et al. 1998, Siebenmorgen et\n\n9\n\nal. 1999b, Efstathiou et al. 2000, Ruiz et al. 2001).\nThe procedure applied here is described by Kr\u00fcgel &\nSiebenmorgen (1994). The model assumes spherical symmetry which seems justified as the mid IR continuum image of NGC1808 (Fig. 1) indicates an oblate structure with\nratio of major\u2013to\u2013minor axis of less than 3 : 2. It has the\nfollowing characteristics:\n\u2013 There are two stellar populations both distributed\nwithin the nucleus: a) giants of 5000K surface temperature with a radial density distribution that falls off\nfrom the center to the edge of the nucleus like r\u22121.8 .\nb) OB stars (TOB = 30000K, LOB = 104 L\u2299 ) each of\nwhich is surrounded by a spherical dust cloud. Their\ndistribution drops inversely proportional to the radial\ndistance from the nucleus.\n\u2013 There are hot spots (Kr\u00fcgel & Tutokov 1978). The\nheating of the dust in the galactic nucleus does not\nonly change on large scales, but also locally. A grain\nat a galactic distance R, as far as possible away from\nany star, gets less heated than one at same galactic\nradius R, but close to a star. The hot spots are formed\nby the dusty envelopes around the OB stars.\nIn computing the radiative transfer in the hot spots, we\nassume that they are spheres. On the surface of the spheres\nthe dust is heated equally by the ISRF of the galactic\nnucleus and by the central OB star. Consequently, the\nsize of the hot spots is smaller in the center and increases\nin the outer regions of the nucleus.\nNote that the emission of the hot spots is not just\nadded to the emission from the rest of the nucleus,\nbut is included in a self\u2013consistent way (see Kr\u00fcgel &\nSiebenmorgen 1994). The main effect of the hot spots is\nto drastically enhance the mid IR flux.\nThe model nucleus of NGC1808 has a total luminosity\nLtot = 5.6 * 1010 L\u2299 , a gas mass Mgas = 1.2 * 109 M\u2299 , not\nterribly different from CO estimates (Dahlem et al. 1990),\nand a radius R \u223c 3kpc. The dust density is constant in the\ninner parts of the nucleus where the OB stars are located\nand declines smoothly like \u03c1(r) \u221d r\u22121 further out. For the\ndistribution of the OB stars, we take the FWHM of the\n6\u03bcm image as a guide and adopt an outer radius ROB =\n350 pc. From fitting the near IR data, we find that the near\nIR flux is mostly due to giants and put LG = 5.5 * 1010 L\u2299 .\nThe OB stars have a total luminosity LOB = 0.5 * 1010 L\u2299 ,\neach individual OB star or hot spot has LHS = 104 L\u2299 .\nThe density in the hot spots is constant, nHS (H+H2 ) =\n104 H atoms per cm3 . Model parameters are summarised\nin Table 3.\nResults are shown in Fig. 5. Because of the hot spots,\nthe 25\u03bcm IRAS point is matched, which was not possible\nin the optically thin model of Fig. 4, and the agreement\nwith the CVF data is even better.\nFig. 6 convincingly illustrates the importance of the\nhot spots and of PAHs for the mid IR spectrum of a galactic nucleus. We mention that the contribution of the very\nsmall grains is almost negligible; including them hardly\n\n\f10\n\nR. Siebenmorgen et al.: The Infrared Continuum Radiation of NGC1808\n\nFig. 6. To demonstrate the significance of the hot spots and of the PAHs for the mid IR spectrum, the model of Fig.5\n(dashed) is compared to two large\u2013grain\u2013only models. The first has hot spots (full line) and indicates the continuum\nunderlying the PAH emission; the second is without hot spots and the dust is only heated by the ISRF. Note the\nlogarithmic scale.\nchanges anything. Fig. 6 also suggests that at 6\u03bcm, the\nwavelength where we obtained a map and performed the\npolarisation measurements, about 50% of the flux comes\nfrom large grains. Therefore the proposition made at the\nend of Sect. 3 that the polarisation is due to emission by\nlarge grains is likely.\n\n7. Conclusion\nISO observations of the inner 25\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 25\u2032\u2032 nucleus of\nNGC1808 show at 6 \u03bcm up to 20% and at 170 \u03bcm a net polarisation of 2.5%. The mid IR polarisation map is the first\nof its kind of an extragalactic source. To explain the mid\nand far IR polarisation we rule out synchrotron radiation,\nscattering from large grains, PAH or small grain emission.\nEmission by large (\u2265 100 \u00c5), non\u2013spherical grains, aligned\non large scales (\u223c 500 pc) by uniform magnetic fields is\nproposed as the major mid and far IR polarisation driver.\nISOCAM mid IR spectroscopy revealed a multitude of\nemission bands. We report the discovery of PAH features\nsituated longward of 13\u03bcm which are detected for the first\ntime in a galaxy. Based on this observation, we derive\n\nintegrated absorption cross sections of astronomical PAH\nwhich can be used for future dust studies.\nThe polarimetric and spectro\u2013photometric data are\nconsistently explained by a radiative transfer model which\nconsiders small localized regions of warm dust in the immediate vicinity of early type stars (hot spots). We demonstrate that this local heating gives rise to a significant\ncontribution to the mid IR continuum by large grains. We\nfind that the emission of small graphites or small silicates\nis negligible.\nIn addition, we conclude that NGC 1808 is not a starburst since in our model only 10% of the total luminosity\ncomes from OB stars. This is supported by the observation\nthat the optical depth in NGC 1808 is more than a factor\n5 lower than in genuine starbursts like M82 or NGC 253.\nAcknowledgements.
