Snell's law may also be derived from a photon\nbeam theory of light rays. This latter particle physics view is by far the most simple one for\nunderstanding the laws of refraction.\nPACS numbers: 42.15.-i,42.15.Dp,41.85.-p\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nII.\n\nSnell's law of refraction is usually discussed in elementary physics courses wherein the derivations[1] depend\non the electromagnetic wave theory of light. The purpose of this note is to show how the laws of refraction\nmay be derived from the particle (i.e. photon) view of\nlight rays. In particular, we show how the photon Hamiltonian H(p, r) must be derived. In this work, p and r\ndenote, respectively, the momentum and position of a\nphoton as it moves along the light ray.\nThe refraction of a light ray is shown in Fig.1. In\nterms of the indices of refraction, Snell's law of refraction\nasserts[2, 3] that\nn1 sin \u03b81 = n2 sin \u03b82\n\n(Snell\u2032 s Law).\n\n(1)\n\nThe derivation of Eq.(1) from the energy and momentum\nconservation laws associated with photon deflection is exhibited Sec.II. The index of refraction is then defined in\nterms of photon energy and momentum. The relationship\nbetween the index of refraction and the photon velocity\nis discussed in Sec.III and from a more general geometric\noptics limit in Sec.IV. As an application of the particle\nviewpoint, we consider in Sec.V the gravitational lens,\ni.e. the bending of light rays in a gravitational field.\n\nCONSERVATION LAWS\n\nWe assume that the two rays in Fig.1 are made up of\nphotons with momenta p1 and p2 respectively. We also\nassume that the photon energies are E1 and E2 respectively. Since there is translational invariance in directions parallel to the plane separating the two media, the\nphoton momentum components parallel to the plane are\nconserved ; i.e.\np1 sin \u03b81 = p2 sin \u03b82 .\n\n(2)\n\nThe energies of the photons are also conserved; i.e.\nE1 = E2 .\n\n(3)\n\nIn terms of physical photon energy and momentum, the\nindices of refraction are defined by\ncp1\ncp2\nn1 =\nand n2 =\n.\n(4)\nE1\nE2\nEqs.(2)-(4) imply\nn1 sin \u03b81 = n2 sin \u03b82 ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhich constitutes a simple yet rigorous derivation of\nSnell's law.\nAlthough similar to other treatments which discuss a\nformal energy and a formal momentum[4, 5], we stress\nthat in our treatment we only refer to the physical photon\nenergy and momentum. For example, E has conventional\nunits of Joules and momentum p has conventional units\nof Joule-sec/meter. In other more formal treatments,\nthe so-called \"energy\" and \"momentum\" do not have the\nusual physical dimensions of energy and momentum.\nIII.\n\nPHOTON VELOCITY\n\nThe definitions of the indices of refraction in Eq.(4) are\nequivalent to the more usual definitions\nc\nc\nand n2 =\n.\n(6)\nn1 =\nu1\nu2\nFIG. 1: A light ray moves from a medium with index of refraction n1 into a medium with index of refraction n2 .
