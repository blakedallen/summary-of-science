We present the first results obtained at CFHT with the TRIDENT infrared camera, dedicated to the detection of faint companions\nclose to bright nearby stars. Its main feature is the acquisition of three\nsimultaneous images in three wavelengths (simultaneous differential imaging) across the methane absorption bandhead at 1.6\u03bcm, that enables a\nprecise subtraction of the primary star PSF while keeping the companion signal. Gl229 and 55Cnc observations are presented to demonstrate\nTRIDENT subtraction performances. It is shown that a faint companion\nwith a \u2206H of 10 magnitudes would be detected at 0.5\u2032\u2032 from the primary.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the past few years, our group has developed the specialized infrared camera\nTRIDENT (Marois et al. 2000a, 2002) to search for faint companions (brown\ndwarfs and Jovian planets) at a projected distance of 5AU to 50AU from stars\nin the solar neighborhood. This corresponds to the range of orbital distance for\nthe massive planets of the Solar system. It is therefore of special interest to test\nthe uniqueness of our planetary system. Ground detection of faint companions\nis difficult because of the atmospheric turbulence that distorts the star PSF\nand optical aberrations that produce quasi-static PSF structures. The main\nfeature of TRIDENT is to acquire three simultaneous images in three distinct\nnarrow spectral bands, making possible very good atmospheric speckle and optical aberration calibration to subtract the stellar PSF. If the three simultaneous\nwavelengths are carefully chosen, it is possible to enhance the star/companion\ncontrast after image combinations by selecting special spectral features that are\ntypical of the companion and not of the star (Smith 1987; Rosenthal, Gurwell,\n& Ho 1996; Racine et al. 1999; Marois et al. 2000b). In TRIDENT, the three\nwavelengths (1.567 \u03bcm, 1.625 \u03bcm and 1.680 \u03bcm, 1% bandwidth) have been\nselected across the 1.6 \u03bcm methane absorption bandhead that is only present\nin the spectrum of cold (Teff < 1470 K, Fegley and Lodders (1996)) substellar\nobjects. This paper describes the first results obtained with TRIDENT.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n2.\n\nMarois, Nadeau, Doyon, Racine & Walker\nObservations\n\nData were obtained on 2001 July 8-12 and on 2001 November 21-24, at the f/20\nfocus of the 3.6m CFHT adaptive optics bonnette PUEO (Rigaut et al. 1998)\nwith TRIDENT. Flat fields and darks were obtained during the day. Three\ntypes of observing techniques were used. In July, data well inside the linear\nregime of the detector were acquired to test the PSF stability. Total integration\ntime was typically 1h per target. Seeing conditions for this run were medium to\ngood (AO strehl of 0.5 in H band). In November, reference stars were acquired\nand instrument rotations (+/\u2212 90 degrees by steps of 2 degrees) were done to\ncalibrate or smooth non-common path aberrations discovered to be the limiting\nfactor in the July mission data. Saturated and non-saturated images were acquired to minimize readout noise. Total integration time was 1h30 with medium\nseeing conditions (AO strehl from 0.15 to 0.4 in the H band). In total, 35 stars\nwere observed during these two missions with spectral type ranging from B to M.\nSome stars were observed on different nights to acquire more photons and study\nPSF stability. See Marois et al. 2003 for more details about data reduction and\nanalysis. Figure 1 shows the Gl229 system with the star PSF removed.\n\nGl229a\n\nGl229a\n\nGl229b\n\nGl229b\n\nFigure 1.\nThe Gl229 system with the star PSF removed (15 minutes\nintegration). The left frame shows the difference between the 1.567 \u03bcm\nand the 1.680 \u03bcm images. In the right frame, the difference between\nthe 1.625 \u03bcm and the 1.680 \u03bcm images is presented. Gl229 methane\nbrown dwarf companion (Gl229b) is visible in the lower right corner of\nthe left frame.\nIf a companion contains methane in its atmosphere, like Gl229b, it will be\nbright in the 1.567 \u03bcm filter and faint in the other two filters. The subtraction\nof the 1.567 \u03bcm and the 1.680 \u03bcm images thus shows a bright companion while\nthe subtraction of the 1.625 \u03bcm and the the 1.680 \u03bcm images does not. The\ncompanion magnitude through the three narrow band filters is thus used to confirm the presence of methane in the object atmosphere and the substellar nature\nof the object. A spectral class can be derived by estimating the companion\ncontrast ratios between the three filters and then fit them with the Burgasser\net al. 2002 T-type spectral classification. A proper motion follow-up would be\nnecessary to confirm the gravitationnal bond between the object and the star.\n\n\fDifferential Simultaneous Imaging\n\n3\n\nTRIDENT can also detect companions with no methane in their atmosphere. Since the three PSFs need to be scaled to properly subtract the PSF\nstructure, the companion-star separation is thus evolving with wavelength. Figure 2 shows the 55Cnc star PSF subtraction residuals with a reference star\ncalibration and a simulated L dwarf (no methane) companion as seen at CFHT\nand scaled to an 8 m telescope. In this situation, the companion is equally\nbright (no methane) in the three filters, so it is not possible to confirm directly\nthe substellar nature of the object. Two observations a few months apart and\nphotometric analysis would be necessary to confirm companionship and the substellar nature of the companion. Figure 3 shows the detection threshold for the\ndifferential simultaneous imaging technique. It can be seen that the PSF subtraction residuals are 3 magnitudes brigther than the photon noise limit at 0.5\u2032\u2032 .\nPSF evolution due to optical flexions and atmospheric variations is the main\nlimitation when attempting high precision PSF calibrations and subtractions.\n\nFigure 2.\nThe 55Cnc system with the star PSF removed (1h integration). A reference star was used to further enhance the detection\nthreshold by subtracting aberrations in each optical path. A simulated L dwarf companion (0.8\u2032\u2032 away and 8 magnitudes fainter) was\nadded. The left frame shows the difference between the 1.567 \u03bcm and\nthe 1.680 \u03bcm 55Cnc images as seen with the TRIDENT camera at\nCFHT. The right frame shows the same residuals but scaled to an 8 m\ntelescope.\n\n3.\n\nConclusion - TRIDENT new developments\n\nTypical attenuation in good seeing conditions is 10 magnitudes in the H band\nat 0.5\u2032\u2032 , as good as or better than what has been done on any other telescope.\nReference star offered good but not perfect PSF calibration, mainly because\nof the PSF structure slow evolution with telescope pointing and atmospheric\nvariations. Photon noise limited subtraction requires the minimization of optical\naberrations. To increase PSF correlation, and thus subtraction performances,\na new optical design is presently under evaluation that mainly consists of a\nbetter beam splitter and filters located near the detector to minimize wavefront\ndegradation. The goal is photon noise limited performance for 1h integrations.\nThis work is supported in part through grants from NSERC, Canada and\nfrom Fonds FQRNT, Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n\f4\n\nMarois, Nadeau, Doyon, Racine & Walker\n\nReferences\nBurgasser, A.
