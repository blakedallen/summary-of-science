INTRODUCTION\n\nThe standard cosmological picture of hierarchical\nstructure formation dictates that virialized objects such\nas clusters of galaxies continue to grow by accreting dark\nmatter and baryonic gas. It is generically expected that\nstrong accretion shocks occur around the virial radii of\nall sufficiently massive clusters, where infalling gas of relatively low temperature is heated up to the virial value\n(e.g. Voit 2004). Here \"accretion\" signifies not only infall of diffuse gas but also minor mergers, i.e. merging of\nvirialized objects with relatively small masses compared\nto the cluster. Such shocks are potentially interesting\nsites of high energy particle acceleration and nonthermal emission, possessing high Mach numbers and capable of generating particles with hard spectra at high efficiency (Ryu et al. 2003; Gabici & Blasi 2003; Inoue &\nNagashima 2005). This is in contrast to major merger\nshocks, which are likely to play a lesser role for high energy phenomena on account of their low Mach numbers\n(c.f. Totani & Kitayama 2000; Takizawa & Naito 2000;\nBerrington & Dermer 2003).\nPrimary electrons, i.e. those accelerated directly by\nthe shocks, give rise to radio synchrotron emission as\nwell as inverse Compton (IC) emission by upscattering\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB) to UV, hard\nX-ray and gamma-ray energies (e.g. Hwang 1997; Ensslin\n& Biermann 1998; Sarazin 1999; Atoyan & V\u00f6lk 2000;\nWaxman & Loeb 2000; Petrosian 2001). Such emission should spatially trace the morphology of their injection sites, which are shell-like regions of Mpc radii\nfor accretion shocks (e.g. Miniati 2003). On the other\nhand, protons interact with the intracluster gas and generate \u03c0 0 decay gamma-ray emission (V\u00f6lk, Aharonian &\n1 Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Kernphysik, Postfach 103980, 69029\nHeidelberg, Germany\n2 Division of Theoretical Astronomy, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan 181-8588\n3 inoue@mpi-hd.mpg.de\n\nBreitschwerdt 1996; Berezinsky, Blasi & Ptuskin 1997;\nPfrommer & Ensslin 2004), as well as synchrotron and IC\nemission by secondary electrons and positrons from \u03c0 \u00b1\ndecay (Blasi & Colafrancesco 1999), all of which should\nfollow the centrally-concentrated spatial distribution of\nthermal gas.\nThe current observational evidence for such kinds of\nnonthermal emission is still ambiguous. Various types of\ndiffuse radio emission in clusters are known (Kempner\net al. 2003; Feretti, Burinaga & Ensslin 2004); however,\nexcept for a few cases, they cannot be easily explained as\ndue to primary electrons nor secondary electrons from pp interactions (Brunetti 2004). More controversially, diffuse excess emission over the known thermal component\nhas been reported for a few clusters in the extreme UV\nband (e.g. Bowyer et al. 2004) and in hard X-rays (e.g.\nRephaeli & Gruber 2002; Fusco-Femiano et al. 2004;\nHenriksen & Hudson 2004), which has been interpreted\nas IC emission from either primary or secondary electrons. There is no clear case yet for gamma-ray emission\nfrom any cluster (Reimer et al. 2003).\nCluster accretion shocks have also been proposed\nas candidate sources of ultra-high energy (UHE) cosmic rays (Norman, Melrose & Achterberg 1995; Kang,\nRachen & Biermann 1997). However, despite being viable on energetic grounds, realistic evaluations of the\nmaximum proton energy seem to fall short of 1020 eV\nby 1 to 2 orders of magnitude (Ostrowski & SiemieniecOzieblo 2000; Jones 2004).\nIn this letter, we point out that protons plausibly accelerated to 1018 -1019 eV in cluster accretion shocks should\ninduce important radiative signatures that have not been\ninvestigated so far: synchrotron and IC emission from\nsecondary electron-positron pairs produced in p-\u03b3 interactions with the CMB. Aharonian (2002) and Rordorf,\nGrasso & Dolag (2004) have discussed these processes by\nassuming that some source, e.g. a powerful radio galaxy,\nresides inside a cluster and injects UHE protons into its\nsurroundings. Here such mechanisms are studied in the\n\n\f2\n\nInoue, Aharonian & Sugiyama\n\ncontext of protons originating in accretion shocks that\nmay be generic to all massive clusters. We adopt the\nWMAP cosmological parameters (Spergel et al. 2003):\n\u03a9m = 0.27, \u03a9\u039b = 0.73, h = 0.71 and \u03a9b = 0.044.\n2. MODEL\n\nFor concreteness, we consider a fiducial cluster of mass\nM = 2 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 located at distance D = 100 Mpc,\nsimilar to the Coma cluster. Spherical symmetry and\nsteady state conditions are assumed for simplicity. The\naccretion shock radius Rs is taken to be the virial radius,\nRs \u2243 3.2 Mpc (Voit 2004). Since gas falls in at a velocity\nequal to the circular velocity Vc = (GM/Rs )1/2 \u2243 1600\nkm/s and comes to rest downstream of the accretion\nshock as the shock expands outwards, the shock velocity relative to the upstream gas is Vs = (4/3)Vc \u2243 2200\nkm/s. The magnetic field at the shock Bs is uncertain, as\nFaraday rotation measurements do not give strong constraints at radii & 1 Mpc (Clarke, Kronberg & B\u00f6hringer\n2001, Johnston-Hollitt & Ekers 2004). Some observations of diffuse synchrotron emission in intergalactic regions outside but near clusters suggest field strengths\n\u223c 0.1-1\u03bcG (Kronberg 2004). We thus choose Bs to be\na parameter with 0.1-1\u03bcG as a reasonable range, corresponding to 0.05-5 % of the gas thermal energy at Rs for\nour fiducial cluster, when an isothermal density profile\nand gas fraction fg = \u03a9b /\u03a9m = 0.16 are assumed.\nWe first evaluate the maximum accelerated proton energy as in Kang et al. (1997). The timescale tacc for\naccelerating a proton up to energy Ep in strong shocks\nis (Blandford & Eichler 1987)\ntacc =\n\n20 \u03b7rg c\n3 Vs2\n\nEp\n\u2243 4.4 \u00d7 10 yr \u03b7 18\n10 eV\n8\n\n\u0012\n\nBs\n1\u03bcG\n\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\nVs\n2200km/s\n\n\u0013\u22122\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b7 characterizes the mean free path for scattering\nby magnetic disturbances, normalized by the particle gyroradius rg = Ep /eBs . Observations of nonthermal emission from supernova remnant (SNR) shocks indicate that\n\u03b7 is close to unity, i.e. the Bohm diffusion limit (e.g.\nV\u00f6lk, Berezhko & Tsenofontov 2005). Although it is not\nguaranteed that this condition is also realized in cluster\naccretion shocks, we will assume \u03b7 = 1 in what follows.\nOn the timescale of Eq.(1), energy losses by photopair\nand photopion interactions with the CMB become significant. We use simple fitting formulae for the timescales\nof each, which agree with more accurate calculations (e.g.\nYoshida & Teshima 1993) to within \u223c 20 % in the pertinent energy ranges: tp\u03b3 = max[t0 exp(Ec /Ep ), t1 ], with\nt0 = 3.2 \u00d7 109 yr, t1 = 4.6 \u00d7 109 yr and Ec = 3 \u00d7 1018 eV\nfor photopair losses, and t0 = 2.65\u00d7107 yr, t1 = 4.5\u00d7107\nyr and Ec = 2.65 \u00d7 1020 eV for photopion losses (see also\nWaxman 1995). In addition, we consider the dynamical timescale tdyn = RS /Vc \u2243 1.9 Gyr to be the lifetime of the accretion shock, limiting the entire process.\nOn timescales much longer than this, the conditions may\nchange so appreciably as to invalidate our steady state\napproximation (e.g. the cluster may undergo a major\nmerger). Note that the timescale for adiabatic losses\nin the expanding accretion shock will always be larger,\n\u223c 3tdyn , as the shock expansion velocity is \u223c Vc /3.\n\nThe maximum proton energy Emax is obtained by\nequating tacc and min[tp\u03b3 , tdyn ]. With Bs = 0.1-1\u03bcG,\nEmax \u2243 4.5 \u00d7 1018 eV (Bs /1\u03bcG) (tdyn /1.9Gyr), always\nlimited by the shock lifetime. Although this fails to reach\nthe realm of the observed highest energy cosmic rays, it\nis noteworthy that tp\u03b3 is within an order of magnitude of\ntdyn in the range Ep \u223c 1018 -1019 eV. This implies that\nduring the process, a significant fraction of the proton\nenergy can be channeled into secondary pairs and consequent radiation.\nThe protons are assumed to form an energy distribution with spectral index 2, appropriate for strong shocks\nin the test particle limit, and an exponential cutoff at\nEmax , i.e. \u221d Ep\u22122 exp(\u2212Ep /Emax ). This is injected\ndownstream of the shock for a duration tinj = tdyn , at\na constant rate normalized by the proton luminosity Lp .\nWe posit Lp to be a fraction fp = 0.1 of Lacc , the kinetic\nenergy flux through strong accretion shocks, which can\nbe expressed\nLacc = fg GM \u1e40 /Rs = fg facc M Vc3 /Rs\n\u0012\n\u00135/3\nfg facc\nM\n\u2243 2.9 \u00d7 1046 erg/s\n(2)\n0.16 0.1 2 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299\nwhere \u1e40 = facc Vc3 /G is the mass accretion rate (White\n1994), and facc \u2243 0.1 is a factor that was estimated by\nKeshet et al. (2004) using numerical simulations. The\nnumerical value above is for our chosen cosmological parameters, and is consistent with the simulation results of\nMiniati (2002) as well as the analytic estimates of Gabici\n& Blasi (2004a).\nGiven the proton spectrum and injection rate, we follow the method described by Aharonian (2002) to compute secondary particle production from proton interactions and the resultant emission. The emission region is taken to be a uniform sphere of radius Rs for\nsimplicity, although this should actually be a shell behind the shock. The kinetic equations for the energy\ndistributions of protons and secondary pairs are solved\nself-consistently with the emitted spectra, including the\nprocesses of p-\u03b3 pair production, p-\u03b3 pion production,\nsynchrotron and IC radiation from all pairs, and proton\nsynchrotron radiation. Gamma-ray and pair production\nfrom p-p interactions can also be calculated for a given\nambient gas density; we take this to be n = 10\u22126 cm\u22123 ,\nappropriate for the low density regions around Rs . The\ndiffusion coefficient for protons inside the emission region\nis considered to be similar to that at the shock, implying that diffusive escape is unimportant up to energies\nEesc \u2243 1019 eV \u03b7 \u22121 (Bs /\u03bcG)(Rs /3Mpc)2 (tinj /2Gyr)\u22121 .\nIntergalactic gamma-ray absorption is incorporated using the diffuse extragalactic infrared background (IRB)\nmodel discussed in Aharonian (2001).\n3. RESULTS\n\nFig.1 shows the broadband spectra of emission induced\nby protons in the accretion shock of our fiducial cluster,\nfor the cases of Bs = 0.1, 0.3 and 1\u03bcG. These respectively imply Emax = 4.5 \u00d7 1017, 1.4 \u00d7 1018 and 4.5 \u00d7 1018\neV, close to or above the CMB photopair threshold but\nbelow the photopion threshold. The pairs are injected\nat very high energies \u223c (2me /mp )Ep \u223c 1015 eV and\nthen rapidly lose energy via synchrotron and IC cool-\n\n\fHard X-rays and Gamma-Rays from UHE Protons in Cluster Shocks\ning, developing an energy distribution \u221d Ee\u22122 and emitting hard spectra with photon indices \u0393 \u223c 1.5 (Aharonian 2002). Spectral peaks occur at \u223c 1-100 keV for\nsynchrotron and at \u223c 10-100 TeV for IC, while intergalactic absorption by the IRB imposes a further cutoff\nabove \u223c 10 TeV in the observed flux. Note the large\ninfluence of Bs , which affects both the synchrotron cooling rate and the peak energy as well as the amount of\npair injection by changing the fraction of protons above\nthreshold through Emax . Lower Bs causes lower Emax\nand less pair injection but also reduces the synchrotron\ncooling, leading overall to increased IC and decreased\nsynchrotron luminosities; for higher Bs , vice-versa. The\nrelative luminosities together with the peak frequency locations should allow Bs to be reliably determined from\nobservations. For our range of Bs , the emitted power\nis mostly dominated by IC gamma-rays and can be as\nlarge as \u223c 1044 erg/s, despite Klein-Nishina suppression\nbeing effective near the peak. This testifies that protons\nabove threshold are radiatively efficient in the sense that\na major portion of their energy is converted to radiative\npairs. With n = 10\u22126 cm\u22123 , \u03c0 0 gamma-rays and secondary pair radiation from p-p interactions only make\na miniscule contribution, although they should be more\npronounced from the central, higher density regions of\nthe cluster, which is not considered here.\nOwing to the hard spectra and high radiative efficiency from protons, the p-\u03b3 pair (hereafter PGP) emission may dominate the hard X-ray and TeV gammaray bands over other components from primary electrons or p-p interactions, which should have spectra with\n\u0393 \u223c 2 or steeper at these energies. Conversely, where\nPGP emission is not strong, as in the GeV range, the\nlatter processes may still prevail. For example, if the\nelectron injection efficiency relative to the accretion kinetic energy is fe = 0.01, the primary IC luminosity\nLIC \u2243 (2 ln \u03b3e,max )\u22121 fe Lacc \u2243 8 \u00d7 1042 erg/s for our\nfiducial cluster, where \u03b3e,max \u223c 3 \u00d7 107 is the maximum\nelectron Lorentz factor determined from the balance between acceleration and cooling times. This leads to flux\n\u223c 7 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 from D = 100 Mpc, close to\nthe \u223c 100 MeV EGRET upper limit for Coma (Reimer et\nal. 2003); nevertheless, PGP emission can be dominant\nat TeV if Bs . 0.3\u03bcG. Note that although fe is quite uncertain and values up to \u223c 0.01 may be allowed, it may\nin fact be significantly lower. The spatial distribution of\nPGP emission should be similar to primary IC, tracking the projected ring-like morphology of the accretion\nshock, so that p-p \u03c0 0 gamma-rays may still be prominent\nfor the central core regions in spatially resolved maps.\nTo assess the detectability of PGP emission with various observational facilities, we note that even though\nthe full angular extent of the accretion shock diameter\ncan be as large as 3.6\u25e6 (Rs /3.2Mpc)(D/100Mpc)\u22121 , the\nexpected ring-like distribution is highly nonuniform; we\nthus choose to compare model fluxes with instrumental\nsensitivities for sources uniformly extended by 1\u25e6 . Most\npromising for detection is the PGP IC component in TeV\ngamma-rays, where the currently operating HESS4 array\nof Cerenkov telescopes can achieve point source sensitivities \u223c 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 at 1 TeV in \u223c100 hr exposure\ntime. With its 0.1\u25e6 angular resolution, the 1\u25e6 extended\n4\n\nhttp://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/HESS.html\n\n3\n\nsource sensitivity should be roughly 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ,\nso that even our least luminous case of Bs = 1\u03bcG may\nbe detectable, not to mention the more luminous, lower\nBs cases. Furthermore, its 5\u25e6 field of view may allow\nclear imaging of the annular morphology with a single pointing. Detecting the weaker PGP IC emission\nat GeV energies may be difficult even for the GLAST5\nmission, with expected point source sensitivities reaching \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 at 1 GeV during a 1 yr\nsurvey. Moreover, it could likely be that other emission\ncomponents such as primary IC show up above the PGP\nemission levels in this band (e.g. Miniati 2003; Gabici &\nBlasi 2004a).\nThe PGP synchrotron component should be interesting\nfor future facilities such as NeXT (Takahashi 2005), capable of imaging hard X-rays in the 8-80 keV range at \u223c\n30\" resolution. The projected sensitivity for a 1\u25e6 source\nis \u223c 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 at 30 keV in a 100 ks exposure,\nso the cases of Bs & 0.3\u03bcG should be clearly detectable,\nand the accretion shock morphology may be studied in\nfine detail. The non-imaging HXD instrument on the\nsoon-to-be launched ASTRO-E2 (Takahashi 2005), with\na sensitivity of . 3 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 at 20 keV, as\nwell as instruments onboard INTEGRAL may also have\nchances of detection if Bs & 1\u03bcG.\nFinally, it is interesting to consider whether the model\ncan explain the reported excess UV and hard X-ray emission for the Coma cluster. In Fig.2, multifrequency data\ncompiled in Reimer et al. (2004) are compared with a\nmodel with Bs = 0.7\u03bcG, Lp = 9\u00d71045 erg/s and Tinj = 4\nGyr, otherwise being the same as in Fig.1. Despite appearing rather consistent, we recall that the UV and\nhard X-ray data correspond only to the inner . 1\u25e6 region, whereas the model emission should be extended\nout to projected radius \u2243 1.8\u25e6 . To explain the observations with just the fraction of emission projected onto\nthe core, more extreme parameters for Lp and/or tdyn\nmay be necessary. Moreover, Bowyer et al. (2004) argue\nthat the UV emission is spatially correlated with thermal X-rays, favoring a p-p secondary origin. In any case,\nfurther observations at these as well as gamma-ray energies should provide conclusive answers. Note that neither\nthe PGP nor p-p secondary synchrotron component from\nthe accretion shock can account for the radio emission\n(Thierbach, Klein & Wielebinski 2003), calling for a different origin such as particles accelerated by turbulence\n(Brunetti 2004; Fujita, Takizawa & Sarazin 2003).\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nSuccessful observations of the PGP emission discussed\nabove entails a number of important implications, by providing: 1) a clear signature of UHE protons in cluster accretion shocks, and hence a test of particle acceleration\ntheory on the largest scales; 2) a sensitive probe of magnetic fields in the outermost regions of clusters, which is\ncrucial for understanding the origin of intergalactic and\nintracluster magnetic fields, propagation of UHE cosmic\nrays, etc.; 3) a potential probe of the accretion shock itself, which still lacks firm observational evidence despite\nbeing a robustly predicted cosmological phenomenon; 4)\na useful tool for gamma-ray absorption studies of the\nIRB, owing to the hard, steady TeV spectra, as opposed\n5\n\nhttp://www-glast.stanford.edu/\n\n\f4\n\nInoue, Aharonian & Sugiyama\n\nto the highly variable spectra of blazars.\nOur assumption of \u03b7 = 1 as inferred for SNRs may\nnot be completely justified for cluster accretion shocks.\nLarger \u03b7 would decrease Emax and hence the amount\nof pair production and PGP emission; e.g. for the case\nof Bs = 0.3\u03bcG, \u03b7 = 3 and 10 lead to IC luminosities\nlower by factors of \u223c 3 and \u223c 20, respectively. On the\nother hand, the proton injection efficiency can be higher\nthan our choice of fp = 0.1. Increased emission may also\nresult from proton spectra harder than 2 due to nonlinear acceleration effects (Gabici & Blasi 2004b; Kang\n& Jones 2005), as well as from tertiary pairs produced\nin \u03b3-\u03b3 interactions of PGP gamma-rays with the CMB\n(Timokhin, Aharonian & Neronov 2004).\nThe present study may be more appropriate for clusters that are relatively relaxed rathen than those associ-\n\nated with a current or recent major merger, although\naccretion shocks should be present even in the latter\ncase (Ryu et al. 2003). The accretion process in reality\nis neither spherical nor steady, involving clumpy merging along filamentary structures. However, as long as\nthe merging leads to strong, high Mach number shocks,\nproton acceleration may proceed even through successive merging events (Kang & Jones 2005). At any rate,\nmore detailed investigations of the processes discussed\nhere should be carried out by incorporating them in numerical simulations of large scale structure formation.\nWe acknowledge fruitful discussions with E.
