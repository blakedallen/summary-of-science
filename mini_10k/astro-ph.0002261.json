Received ; in original form 1999\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWe present a detailed calculation of the evolution of low\u2013mass (< 0.25 M\u2299 ) helium white dwarfs. These white dwarfs (the optical companions to binary millisecond\npulsars) are formed via long\u2013term, low\u2013mass binary evolution. After detachment from\nthe Roche lobe, the hot helium cores have a rather thick hydrogen layer with mass\nbetween 0.01 to 0.06 M\u2299 . Due to mixing between the core and outer envelope, the\nsurface hydrogen content is 0.5 to 0.35, depending on the initial value of the heavy\nelement (Z) and the initial secondary mass. We found that the majority of our computed models experience one or two hydrogen shell flashes. We found that the mass\nof the helium dwarf in which the hydrogen shell flash occurs depends on the chemical\ncomposition. The minimum helium white dwarf mass in which a hydrogen flash takes\nplace is 0.213 M\u2299 (Z=0.003), 0.198 M\u2299 (Z=0.01), 0.192 M\u2299 (Z=0.02) or 0.183 M\u2299\n(Z=0.03). The duration of the flashes (independent of chemical composition) is between few \u00d7106 years to few \u00d7107 years. In several flashes the white dwarf radius\nwill increase so much that it forces the model to fill its Roche lobe again. Our calculations show that cooling history of the helium white dwarf depends dramatically\non the thickness of the hydrogen layer. We show that the transition from a cooling\nwhite dwarf with a temporary stable hydrogen\u2013burning shell to a cooling white dwarf\nin which almost all residual hydrogen is lost in a few thermal flashes (via Roche\u2013lobe\noverflow) occurs between 0.183\u20130.213 M\u2299 (depending on the heavy element value).\nKey words:\nbinaries: close - binaries: general - stars: mass loss evolution - stars: millisecond binary pulsars - pulsars: individual: PSR J0437\n+ 4715 - pulsars: individual: PSR J1012 + 5307\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nKippenhahn, Kohl & Weigert (1967) were the first who followed the formation of helium white dwarfs (WD) of low\nmass in a binary system. The evolution of a helium WD\nof 0.26 M\u2299 (remnant) was investigated by Kippenhahn,\nThomas & Weigert (1968) who found that a hydrogen flash\ncan be initiated near the base of the hydrogen rich envelope.\nThe energy of the flash is sufficient to cause the envelope to\nexpand to giant dimensions and hence it may be possible\nthat another short term Roche lobe filling can occur.\nIn Webbink (1975), models of a helium white dwarf were\nconstructed by formally evolving a model from the homogeneous zero\u2013age main sequence with the reduction of the\nmass of the hydrogen\u2013rich envelope. When the mass of the\nenvelope is less than some critical value, the model contracts\nadopting white dwarf dimensions. Webbink found that therc 0000 RAS\n\nmal flashes do not occur for WDs less massive than 0.2 M\u2299 .\nAlberts et al. (1996) have confirmed Webbink's finding that\nlow\u2013mass white dwarfs do not show thermal flashes and the\ncooling age for WDs of mass Mwd \u22640.20M\u2299 can be considerably underestimated if using the traditional WD cooling\ncurves which were constructed for Mwd >0.3M\u2299 (Iben & Tutukov 1986, IT 86).\nRecently, Hansen & Phinney (1998a \u2013 HP98) and Benvenuto & Althaus (1998 \u2013 BA98) investigated the effect of\ndifferent mass of the hydrogen layer (10\u22128 \u2264 Menv /M\u2299 \u2264\n4 \u00d7 10\u22123 ) on the cooling evolution of 0.15 \u2264 MHe /M\u2299 \u2264 0.5\nhelium WDs. In both calculations (BA98 and HP98) the\nmass of the hydrogen envelope left on the top of white dwarf\nhas been taken as free parameter. BA98 found that thick\nenvelopes appreciably modify the radii and surface gravities\nof no\u2013H models, especially in the case of low\u2013mass helium\nwhite dwarfs.\n\n\f2\n\nMarek J. Sarna et al.\n\nDriebe et al. (1998 \u2013 DSBH98) present a grid of evolutionary tracks for low-mass white dwarfs with helium cores\nin the mass range from 0.179 to 0.414 M\u2299 . The tracks are\nbased on a 1 M\u2299 model sequence extending from the pre\u2013\nmain sequence stage up to the tip of red giant branch. Applying large mass loss rates forced the models to move off\nthe giant branch and evolve across the Hertzsprung\u2013Russell\ndiagram and down the cooling branch. They found that\nhydrogen flashes take place only for two model sequences,\n0.234 M\u2299 and 0.259 M \u2299, and for very low\u2013mass WDs the\nhydrogen shell burning remains dominant even down to effective temperatures well below 10 000 K. According to our\nprevious calculations (Ergma, Sarna & Antipova, 1998) we\nfind that for a low\u2013mass white dwarf with a helium core,\nwhich was formed during low\u2013mass binary evolution (after\ndetachment from the Roche lobe), the hydrogen layer left on\nthe top of the helium core is much thicker (\u223c 1\u22126\u00d710\u22122 M\u2299\nwith Xsurf ranging from 0.3 to 0.52) than used in cooling calculation by HP98 and BA98. Also in DSBH98 (see their Table 1), for the two lowest total remnant masses the envelope\nmass value is smaller that obtained in our calculations.\n\n2\n\nTHE MAIN AIM\n\nLow\u2013mass helium white dwarfs are present in millisecond\nbinary pulsars and double degenerate systems. This gives\na unique opportunity to test the cooling age of the WD in\na binary and, especially in the case of millisecond binary\npulsars, allows for age determinations for neutron stars that\nare independent of their rotational history.\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram with evolutionary\ntracks. Evolutionary sequence (model 20) which undergoes long\nterm stable hydrogen burning is shown by the solid line. Dashed\nline, the same for model 22 which shows one weak (without\nRLOF) and one strong (with RLOF) hydrogen flash. Circles and\ntriangles mark cooling ages of 1 and 3 Gyr, respectively.\n\nTHE EVOLUTIONARY CODE\n\nThe evolutionary sequences we have calculated are comprised of three main phases:\n\u2022 detached evolution lasting until the companion fills its\nRoche lobe on the time\u2013scale td ;\n\u2022 semi\u2013detached evolution (non\u2013conservative in our calculations) on the time\u2013scale tsd ; t0 =td + tsd ;\n\u2022 a cooling phase of the WD on the time\u2013scale tcool (the final\nphase during which a system with a ms pulsar + low\u2013mass\nhelium WD is left behind). The total evolutionary time is\ntevol = t0 + tcool .\nThe duration of the detached phase is somewhat uncertain; it may be determined either by the nuclear time\u2013scale\nor by the much shorter time\u2013scale of the orbital angular\nmomentum loss owing to the magnetized stellar wind.\nIn our calculations we assume that the semi\u2013detached\nevolution of a binary system is non\u2013conservative, i.e. the\ntotal mass and angular momentum of the system are not\nconserved. We can express the total orbital angular momentum (J) of a binary system as\nJ \u0307\nJ \u0307\n=\nJ\nJ\n\n+\nSM L\n\nJ \u0307\nJ\n\n+\nM SW\n\nJ \u0307\nJ\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nGR\n\nwhere the terms on the right hand side are due to: stellar\nmass angular momentum loss from the system, magnetic\nstellar wind braking, and gravitational wave radiation.\n\n3.1\n\nStellar mass angular momentum loss\n\nThe formalism which we have adopted is described in Muslimov & Sarna (1993). We introduce the parameter f1 characterizing the loss of mass from the binary system and defined by the relations,\n\u1e40 = \u1e402 f1\n\nand\n\n\u1e401 = \u2212\u1e402 (1 \u2212 f1 ),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u1e40 is the mass\u2013loss rate from the system, \u1e402 is\nthe rate of mass loss from the donor (secondary) star and \u1e401\nis the accretion rate onto the neutron star (primary). The\nmatter leaving the system will carry off its intrinsic angular\nmomentum in agreement with formula\nJ \u0307\nJ\n\n= f1 f2\nSM L\n\nM1 \u1e402\nM2 M\n\nyr \u22121 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere M1 and M2 are the masses of the neutron star\nand donor star, respectively and M=M1 +M2 . Here we have\nintroduced the additional parameter f2 , which describes the\nefficiency of the orbital angular momentum loss from the\nsystem due to a stellar wind (Tout & Hall 1991). In our\ncalculations we have f2 =1 and f1 =1; we calculate the fully\nnon\u2013conservative case, although additional calculations with\nf1 = 0.9 and 0.5 (with f2 =1) give similar results. A similar result to ours was found by Tauris (1996), who showed\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fCooling curves\n\n3\n\nwhere a and R2 are the separation of the components\nand the radius of the donor star in solar units.\n\n3.3\n\nGravitational wave radiation\n\nFor systems with very short orbital periods, during the final\nstages of their evolution we also take into account the loss of\norbital angular momentum due to emission of gravitational\nradiation (Landau & Lifshitz 1971):\nJ \u0307\nJ\n\nFigure 2. The surface effective temperature (upper panel), the\nnuclear energy production (middle panel) and the surface luminosity (lower panel) plotted as a function of the cooling time tcool\nwhich is the time elapsed from t0 . Model 20 with stationary hydrogen shell burning \u2013 thick line t0 =7.9\u00d7109 yrs, model 22 with\nunstable hydrogen shell burning \u2013 dashed line t0 =7.8\u00d7109 yrs.\nFirst flash is without RLOF and second flash is accompanied by\nRLOF. For all figures with cooling time tcool is time elapsed from\nt0 .\n\nthat the change in orbital separation due to mass transfer\nin LMXB (low\u2013mass X-ray binaries) as a function of the\nfraction of exchanged matter f1 which is lost from system\nis small (for 0.5\u2264 f1 \u2264 1). To understand whether the system evolution is conservative or non\u2013conservative is not easy\nin the case of a rapidly rotating neutron star; no easy solution can be found. We propose as one possibility a factor\nwhich may help us to distinguish between the two cases \u2013 the\nsurface magnetic field of the neutron star and its evolution\nduring the accretion.\n\n= 8.5 \u00d7 10\u221210\nGR\n\nMagnetic stellar wind braking\n\nWe also assume that the donor star, possessing a convective envelope, experiences magnetic braking (Mestel 1968;\nMestel & Spruit 1987; Muslimov & Sarna 1995), and, as a\nconsequence, the system loses its orbital angular momentum. For a magnetic stellar wind we used the formula for\nthe orbital angular momentum loss\nJ \u0307\nJ\n\n= \u22123 \u00d7 10\u22127\nM SW\n\nM 2 R22\nM1 M2 a5\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nyr \u22121 ,\n\n(4)\n\nyr \u22121\n\n(5)\n\nThe mass and accompanying orbital angular momentum loss from these system are poorly understood problems\nin the evolution of binary stars. As is well known, the variation of the angular momentum depends critically on the\nassumed model (Ergma et al. 1998). In the case of binary\nsystems with ms pulsar typically two different models concerning the mass ejection and angular momentum loss can\nbe adopted. The first is that the amount of angular momentum lost per 1 gram of ejected matter is equal to the average\norbital angular momentum of 1 gram of the binary. The second is that the matter that flows from the companion star\nonto the neutron star (after accretion) is ejected isotropically with the specific angular momentum of the neutron\nstar. In this paper, for our non\u2013conservative approach we\nhave adopted the first model. This affects significantly our\nresults on the semi\u2013detached evolution (see fig. 2 in Ergma\net al. 1998), but very little changes the cooling time\u2013scale\nof the helium white dwarf.\n\n3.4\n\nIllumination of the donor star\n\nIn all cases we have included the effect of illumination of the\ndonor star by the millisecond pulsar. In our calculations we\nassume that illumination of the component by the hard (X\u2013\nray and \u03b3\u2013ray) radiation from the millisecond pulsar leads\nto additional heating of its photosphere (Muslimov & Sarna\n1993). The effective temperature Tef f of the companion during the illumination stage is determined from the relation\n4\nLin + Pill = 4\u03c0\u03c3R22 Tef\nf,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere Lin is the intrinsic luminosity corresponding to\nthe radiation flux coming from the stellar interior and \u03c3 is\nthe Stefan\u2013Boltzmann constant.\nPill is the millisecond pulsar radiation that heats the\nphotosphere, which is determined by\nPill = f3\n\n3.2\n\nM1 M2 M\na4\n\n\u0010 R \u00112\n2\n\n2a\n\nLrot\n\n(7)\n\nand Lrot is \"rotational luminosity\" of the neutron star\ndue to magneto\u2013dipole radiation (plus a wind of relativistic\nparticles)\nLrot =\n\n2 2 6\nB Rns\n3c3\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0\nPp\n\n\u00134\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere Rns is the neutron star radius, B is the value of\nthe magnetic field strength at the neutron star and Pp is the\npulsar period. f3 is the factor characterizing the efficiency\nof transformation of irradiation flux into thermal energy (in\n\n\f4\n\nMarek J. Sarna et al.\n\nour case we take f3 = 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 ). Note that in our calculations the effect of irradiation is formally treated by means\nof modification of the outer boundary condition, according\nto relation (6).\nIn this paper we do not follow the magnetic field and\npulsar period (Pp ) evolution, as we did in our earlier papers\n(Muslimov & Sarna 1993, Ergma & Sarna 1996). We were\nmainly interested in finding initial models for low\u2013mass helium white dwarfs and in investigating the initial cooling\nphase of these low\u2013mass helium white dwarfs. From earlier calculations we know that if the magnetic field strength\nis greater than about 109 G, the neutron star spins\u2013up to\ntenths and hundreds of milliseconds, rather than several milliseconds. This leads to a situation where the pressure of the\nmagneto\u2013dipole radiation is insufficient to eject matter from\nthe system. Also from our previous calculations (see for example Ergma & Sarna 1996) we find that after accretion of\na maximum of about 0.2 M\u2299 , the neutron star has spun\u2013up\nto millisecond periods if B< 109 G. Therefore in this paper\nwe accept that after accretion of 0.2 M\u2299 the neutron star\nspins\u2013up to about 2 ms. After spin\u2013up the pulsar irradiation\nis strong enough to prevent accretion, and at this moment\nwe include non\u2013conservative mass loss from the system as\ndescribed above.\nDuring the initial high mass accretion phase (\u1e402 \u223c\n10\u22128 \u2212 10\u22129 M\u2299 yr \u22121 , tacc \u223c 107 \u2212 108 yrs) the system may\nbe observed as a bright low\u2013mass X\u2013ray binary (LMXB). It\nis necessary to point out that majority of LMXBs for which\norbital period determinations are available (21 systems out\nof 24 according to van Paradijs catalogue 1995), have orbital period of less than one day. These systems therefore\ncannot be the progenitors of the majority of low\u2013mass helium white dwarf + millisecond pulsar binary systems. A\nlack of LMXB systems with orbital period between 1 \u2013 3\ndays does not allow us to make a direct comparison between\nthe observational data and the results of our calculations.\n3.5\n\nThe code\n\nThe models of the stars filling their Roche lobes were computed using a standard stellar evolution code based on\nthe Henyey\u2013type code of Paczy\u0144ski (1970), which has been\nadapted to low\u2013mass stars. The Henyey method involves iteratively improving a trail solution for the whole star. During each iteration, corrections to all variables at all mesh\npoints in the star are evaluated using the Newton\u2013Raphson\nmethod for linearised algebraic equations (see for example\nHansen & Kawaler 1994). The Henyey method extended to\ncalculate stellar evolution with mass loss, as adopted here,\nis well explain by Zi\u00f3lkowski (1970). We note here that our\ncode makes use of the stationary envelope technique, which\nwas developed early on in the life of our code in order to\nsave disc space (Paczy\u0144ski 1969). This method makes the\nassumption that the surface 0.5 \u2013 5% (by mass) of the star\nis not significantly affected by nuclear processes, such that\nit can be treated to a good approximation as homogeneous\nregion (in composition) throughout the whole evolutionary\ncalculation. During the cooling phase we assume that the\nstatic envelope is the surface 0.5% of the star. This assumption is valid during the flashes because the time\u2013scale is\nlonger than thermal time\u2013scale of the envelope. We tested\nthe possibility that the algorithm for redistributing mesh-\n\npoints introduces numerical diffusion into the composition\nprofile. We find that if such numerical diffusion is real, it\nhas only a marginal influence on the hydrogen profile. We\nwould also like to note that in the heat equation we neglect\nthe derivative with respect to molecular weight, since its effect is small. Convection is treated with the mixing\u2013length\nalgorithm proposed by Paczy\u0144ski (1969). We solve the problem of radiative transport by employing the opacity tables\nof Iglesias & Rogers (1996). Where the Iglesias & Rogers\n(1996) tables are incomplete, we have filled the gaps using\nthe opacity tables of Huebner et al. (1977). For temperatures\nless than 6000 K we use the opacities given by Alexander &\nFerguston (1994) and Alexander (private communication).\nThe contribution from conduction present in the opacity tables of Huebner et al. (1977) has been included by us in\nthe other tables, since they don't include it (Haensel, private communication). The equation of state (EOS) includes\nradiation and gas pressure, which is composed of the ion\nand electron pressure. Contribution to the EOS owing to\nthe non\u2013ideal effects of Coulomb interaction and pressure\nionization which influence the EOS, as discussed by Pols et\nal. (1995), have not been included in our program, and for\nthis reason we stopped our cooling calculations before these\neffects become important. During the initial phase of cooling, the physical conditions in the hot white dwarfs are such\nthat these effects are usually small.\n\n4\n\nEVOLUTIONARY CALCULATIONS\n\nWe perform our evolutionary calculations for binary systems\ninitially consisting of a 1.4 M\u2299 neutron star (NS) and a\nslightly evolved companion (subgiant) of two masses, 1 and\n1.5, and four chemical compositions (Z: 0.003, 0.01, 0.02,\n0.03). We have produced (Table 1) a number of evolutionary\ntracks corresponding to the different possible values of the\ninitial orbital period (ranging from 0.7 to 3.0 days) at the\nbeginning of mass transfer phase.\n\n5\n\nTHE RESULTS\n\nIn Table 1 we list the characteristic of the cooling phase of\nthe WD, tcool , and the maximum possible evolution time\nof a system, tevol , which is a sum of times of detached (determined by nuclear evolution), semi\u2013detached, and cooling\nphases. The cooling is the last phase of evolution of the WD,\nand in our calculations starts at the end of RLOF. The cooling time, tcool , is limited to an initial cooling stage during\nwhich the WD cools until its central temperature has decreased by 50 % of its maximum value. From Table 1 it is\nclearly seen that to produce short orbital period systems in\na time\u2013scale shorter than Hubble time it is necessary either\nto have low Z or a more massive secondary.\nIn our calculations the donor star fills its Roche lobe\nwhile it is evolving through the Hertzsprung gap, and therefore it transfers mass on its companion in a thermal time\u2013\nscale.\nFigure 1 show the evolutionary cooling sequences for\nmodels 20 and 22 (more details in Table 1). Model 20\npresents the case with stable hydrogen burning. Model 22\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fCooling curves\n\nFigure 3. Hydrogen flashes on a helium WD of mass 0.213 M\u2299\n(model 7) which show four flashes without RLOF. The curves\npresent the effective temperature (upper panel), nuclear energy\nproduction in the hydrogen burning shell (middle panel) and\nthe luminosity (lower panel) as a function of cooling time,\nt0 =5.2\u00d7109 yrs.\n\nshows the case when the thermal instability of the hydrogen\u2013\nburning shell occurs. The first flash is not strong enough to\nallow the star to overflow its Roche lobe, but during the\nsecond flash the radius of the secondary increases to fill its\nRoche lobe and short\u2013time Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) occurs.\nIn Table 2 we present the mass\u2013radius relationship for\nWDs from our calculations, DSBH98, the Wood models,\nand the Hamada & Salpeter (1961) zero\u2013temperature helium WD models calculated for a surface temperature of\n8500 K (as in van Kerkwijk, Bergeron & Kulkarini 1996 for\nPSR1012+5307). Comparison of the numbers demonstrate\nthat for WD masses of < 0.25 M\u2299 , the results of our calculations differ significantly from a simple extrapolation obtained from the cooling curves (Wood 1990) performed for\ncarbon WDs with the thick hydrogen envelopes. In addition\ncomparing the cooling time\u2013scales of HP98 and BA98 with\nthose of Webbink and our models, shows differences of an\norder of magnitude (Table 3) for WD masses of < 0.25 M\u2299 .\n\n6\n\nHYDROGEN FLASH BURNING\n\nThe problem of unstable hydrogen shell burning in low\u2013\nmass helium WDs was first discussed in the literature more\nthan 30 years ago (Kippenhahn, Thomas & Weigert 1968).\nRecently, Alberts et al. (1996) have claimed that they do\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n5\n\nFigure 4. Hydrogen flashes on a helium WD of mass 0.213 M\u2299\n(model 7). The curves present the white dwarf radius (upper\npanel), the envelope mass (middle panel) and the mass of the\nhelium core (lower panel) as a function of the cooling time,\nt0 =5.2\u00d7109 yrs.\n\nnot see any thermal flashes that result from thermally unstable shell\u2013burning, as reported in papers IT86 and Kippenhahn, Thomas & Weigert (1968). Webbink (1975) found\nthat in none of his model sequences, such a severe thermal runaway as described by Kippenhahn et al. (1968) was\nfound, although mild flashes for M>0.2 M\u2299 did take place.\nAlberts et al. found that even reducing the time step to\n50\u2013100 years would not lead to thermally unstable shell\u2013\nburning for Mwd <0.25 M\u2299 . In DSBH98, thermal instabilities of the hydrogen\u2013burning shell occurs in their two\nmodels, 0.234 M\u2299 and 0.259 M\u2299 . They concluded that hydrogen flashes take place only in the mass interval 0.21\u2264\nM/M\u2299 \u2264 0.3.\nAccording to our computations, low\u2013mass helium WDs\nwith masses more than 0.183 M\u2299 (Z=0.03), 0.192 M\u2299\n(Z=0.02), 0.198 M\u2299 (Z=0.01) and 0.213 M\u2299 , (Z=0.003)\nmay experience up to several hydrogen flashes before they\nenter the cooling stage. In Table 4 we present several characteristics for the computed flashes. We discussion two kinds\nof flashes: in the first case (in Table 4 shown as \"1\"), during\nthe flash the secondary does not fill its Roche lobe i.e. the\nmass of the white dwarf does not change, and in the second\ncase (\"2\"), during the unstable hydrogen burning phase the\nsecondary fills its Roche lobe and the system again enters\ninto a very short duration accretion phase (see Table 4). We\nintroduce four time\u2013scales to describe the flash behaviour:\n(i) the flash rise time\u2013scale \u2206t1 , which is the time for the\nluminosity to increase from minimum to maximum value\n\n\f6\n\nMarek J. Sarna et al.\n\nFigure 5. Same as for Fig.3 but for model 17. During first flash\nthe secondary does not fill its Roche lobe but during the second\nand third flashes RLOF occurs and the total mass of white dwarf\ndecreases (t0 = 1.4\u00d7109 yrs).\n\nFigure 6. Same as for Fig.4 but for model 17. During the first\nflash the secondary does not fill its Roche lobe but during the\nsecond and third flashes RLOF occurs and the total mass of white\ndwarf decreases (t0 = 1.4\u00d7109 yrs).\n\n(typically this value is between few \u00d7106 to few \u00d7107 yrs\n\u2013 third column in the Table 4); (ii) the flash decay time\u2013\nscale \u2206t2 , which is the time for the luminosity to decrease\nto the initial value (typically from few hundred thousand\nto few tenth million years); (iii) \u2206 T is the recurrence time\nbetween two successive flashes (iv) \u2206tacc is the duration of\nthe accretion phase when the secondary fills its Roche lobe\nduring hydrogen shell flash.\nFor all sequences with several unstable hydrogen shell\nburning stages (usually for case \"1\"), the first flash is the\nweakest. In the majority of cases when the flash forces the\nstar to fill its Roche lobe, only one flash takes place. For\nfour cases we found two successive flashes with Roche lobe\noverflow (models 17, 23, 24, 31), and for another two cases\n(models 47, 53) to the first flash is not powerful enough to\nforce the secondary fill its Roche lobe, but during the second\nflash it is.\nHow does the hydrogen flash burning influence the cooling time\u2013scale? In Fig.2, the luminosity and nuclear energy production rates versus cooling time for models 20 and\n22 are shown. Model 20 shows stationary hydrogen burning and model 22, hydrogen flash burning. Although before\nflash model 22 was more luminous than model 20, later the\nsituation is reversed. After the flash, the burning mass of\nthe hydrogen rich envelope in model 22 has decreased to\n0.0116 M\u2299 , whereas the mass of the hydrogen envelope in\nmodel 20, in which stationary hydrogen burning occurs, is\nalmost twice as large (0.0241 M\u2299 ). If we look at how the\n\nmaximum nuclear energy rate behaves with cooling time,\nwe can see that after the flash in model 22, the maximum\nenergy production rate is less than in model 20 (stationary\nhydrogen burning).\nIn Fig. 3 we present the behaviour of log Tef f , log \u01ebnuc\nand log L/L\u2299 , and in Fig.4 log Rwd , Menv and Mf /M\u2299 as a\nfunction of cooling time for model 7. Before the helium white\ndwarf enters the final cooling phase, four unstable hydrogen\nflash burnings occur. The same parameters for model 17\n(with RLOF) are shown in Figs. 5 and 6.\nTo investigate in more detail how the flashes develop, we\nshow in Fig. 7 the evolution of the white dwarf radius (upper\npanel), nuclear energy generation rate (upper middle panel),\nmaximum shell temperature and central temperature (lower\nmiddle panel) and the surface luminosity (lower panel) as a\nfunction of computed model number. In Fig. 7, as vertical\ndashed lines we marked several time\u2013scales which characterize the flash behaviour (for numbers see Table 4). \u2206t1\nand \u2206t2 describe the rise and decay times; the first charshell\nacterizes the nuclear shell burning time\u2013scale (\u03c4nuc\n), the\nsecond the Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz (thermal) envelope\ntime\u2013scale\np env shell\n\u03c4K\u2212H \u03c4nuc ).\nmodified by nuclear shell burning (\u2206t2 =\nThe accretion time (\u2206tacc ) is described by the square of the\nKelvin\u2013Helmholtz time\u2013scale. The radiative diffusion time is\ndefined as the Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz time\u2013scale of the extended\nenv\nenvelope above the shell (\u2206trd = \u03c4K\u2212H\n). The shape of the\nfirst flash on Fig. 7 shows some characteristic changes which\nare connected with physical processes in the stellar interior.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fCooling curves\n\n7\n\nFigure 8. The evolution of temperature inversion layers and luminosity profile during a hydrogen flash. The evolutionary sequences are as follow: solid line \u2013 local luminosity minimum;\ndashed line \u2013 maximum temperature of the hydrogen shell; short\ndashed line \u2013 luminosity front moves outwards; long dashed line\n\u2013 maximum luminosity; dashed doted line \u2013 decline of luminosity,\nheated core cooling effectively.\n\nFigure 7. Hydrogen flashes on a helium WD of model 17. The\nwhite dwarf radius (solid line) together with Roche lobe radius\n(dashed line) (upper panel) the nuclear energy production in the\nhydrogen burning shell (upper middle panel) the maximum shell\ntemperature (solid line) and central temperature (dashed line)\n(lower middle panel) and the surface luminosity (lower panel) as\na function of model number are shown. The vertical lines define\ndifferent time\u2013scales during the flashes.\n\nAt the beginning of the flash the luminosity increases due to\nthe more effective hydrogen burning in the shell source. After reaching a local maximum, the luminosity then decreases\nwhile the nuclear energy generation rate is still increasing\nrapidly. This decrease of the surface luminosity is due to\na temperature inversing forming below the hydrogen shell.\nThe energy generated in the hydrogen shell splits into two\nfluxes; coming outwards and going inwards. The helium core\nis heated effectively by the shell nuclear source \u2013 the central\ntemperature increases by 2%. On Fig. 8 the evolution of the\nluminosity and temperature profiles during the \u2206t1 and \u2206t2\nphases are shown. We clearly see how the inversion profile\nevolves and how the luminosity wave moves into the surface.\nThe nuclear energy generation rate in the shell has a\nmaximum value far away from maximum surface luminosity. This is because the luminosity front is moving towards\nthe stellar surface in a time\u2013scale described by radiative diffusion (\u2206trd ). After reaching a maximum value, the luminosity starts to decrease and the energy generation rate also\ndeclines in the hydrogen shell over a time-scale \u2206t2 (for a\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\ncontracting envelope) the luminosity decreases to the minimum value. During the first flash, the stellar radius does not\nfill the inner Roche lobe. In the second and third flashes we\nhave short episodes of super\u2013Eddington mass transfer (see\nTable 4). During the RLOF phase, the orbital period slightly\nincreases and the subgiant companion evolves quickly from\nspectral type F0 to A0.\nAs already pointed out, for several cases the secondary\nfills its Roche lobe and the system enters an accretion phase.\nDuring RLOF, the mass accretion rate is about three orders of magnitude greater than the Eddington limit (Fig.\n9). All the accreted matter will be lost from the system\n(\u2206Macc \u223c 0.0001 \u2212 0.001 M\u2299 ). The accretion phase is very\nshort, usually less than 1000 years (ranging from 160 to 2500\nyrs \u2013 see Table 4). During the short super\u2013Eddington accretion phase the system is a very bright X\u2013ray source, with\norbital period between 2 to 8 days.\nWe notice that during the flash the evolutionary time\nstep strongly decreases and may be as short as several years.\n\n7\n\nROLE OF BINARITY IN THE COOLING\nHISTORY OF THE LOW\u2013MASS WHITE\nDWARF\n\nDSBH98 modelled single star evolution and produced white\ndwarfs with various masses by applying large mass loss rates\nat appropriate positions in the red\u2013giant branch to force\nthe models to move off the giant branch. To show how binarity influences the final fate of the white dwarf cooling,\nwe have computed extra sequences (1.0+ 1.4 M\u2299 , Z=0.02,\nPi =2.0 days) where we did not take into account that the\n\n\f8\n\nMarek J. Sarna et al.\nwe find that the secondary fills its Roche lobe when the orbital period Pi is \u223c 2.5 days (Tables 1, 4). From our cooling\ntracks for a binary orbital period of 5.741 days, the mass of\nthe companion is 0.21\u00b10.01 M\u2299 and its cooling age 1.26\u2013\n2.25 Gyrs (for a Population I chemical composition). These\ncooling models usually have one strong (with RLOF) hydrogen shell flash, after which the helium WD enters the normal\ncooling phase.\n8.2\n\nFigure 9. Mass accretion rate (model 42) versus time during a\nhydrogen shell flash with RLOF\n\nstar is in a binary system e.g. during hydrogen shell flash\nwe do not allow RLOF. In complete binary model calculation, only one shell flash occurs accompanied with RLOF,\nwhereas for the single star model calculation, four hydrogen\nshell flashes take place. Due to RLOF, the duration of the\nflash phase is 2.7\u00d7106 yrs; if we do not include binarity the\nduration of the flash phase is 1.8\u00d7108 yrs. However, the cooling time for helium white dwarfs less massive than 0.2 M\u2299\nis not significantly changed. This is because the duration of\nflash phase is very short in comparison to the normal cooling phase (towards the white dwarf region). However, the\neffect of binarity will be important for the cooling history\nof more massive helium white dwarfs. In Fig. 10 both cases\nof evolution on the Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram are shown\n\u2013 on the left panel Roche lobe overflow is not allowed, on\nright panel RLOF takes place.\n\n8\n\nAPPLICATION TO INDIVIDUAL SYSTEMS\n\nBelow we discuss the observational data for several systems\nfor which results of our calculations may be applied, by\ntaking into account the orbital parameters of the system,\nthe pulsar spin\u2013down time, and the white dwarf cooling\ntimescale.\n\n8.1\n\nPSR J0437\u20134715\n\nTiming information for this millisecond binary system:\nPp =5.757 ms, Porb =5.741 days, \u03c4 (intrinsic characteristic\nage of pulsar) = 4.4 \u2013 4.91 Gyrs, mass function f(M)=\n1.23910\u22123 M\u2299 (Johnston et al. 1993; Bell et al. 1995).\nHansen & Phinney (1998b) have discussed the evolutionary\nstage of this system using their own cooling models described\nin HP98. They found consistent solution for all masses in\nthe range 0.15 \u2013 0.375 M\u2299 with thick (in the terminology of\nHP98) hydrogen envelopes of 3\u00d710\u22124 M\u2299 .\nTiming measurements by Sandhu et al. (1997) have detected a rate of change in the projected orbital separation\na sin i , which they interpret as a change in i and they calculate for an upper limit for i < 430 and new lower limit to\nthe mass of the companion of M\u223c 0.22 M\u2299 . Our calculations also allow us to produce the orbital parameters and\nsecondary mass for the PSR J0437\u20134715 system and fit its\ncooling age (2.5\u20135.3 Gyrs, Hansen & Phinney, 1998b), and\n\nPSR J1012+5307\n\nLorimer et al. (1995) determined a characteristic age of the\nradio pulsar to be 7 Gyr, which could be even larger if\nthe pulsar has a significant transverse velocity (Hansen &\nPhinney 1998b). Using the IT86 cooling sequences, they estimated the companion to be at most 0.3 Gyr old. HP98\nmodels yield the following results for this system: the companion mass lies in the range 0.13\u20130.21 M\u2299 and the WD age\nis < 0.6 Gyr, the neutron star mass in the range 1.3\u20132.1 M\u2299 .\nAlberts et al. (1996) were the first to show that the cooling timescale of a low\u2013mass WD can be substantially larger\nif there are no thermal flashes which lead to RLOF and a\nreduction of the hydrogen envelope mass. Our and DSBH98\ncalculations confirmed their results that for low\u2013mass helium\nWDs (< 0.2 M\u2299 ), indeed stationary hydrogen burning plays\nimportant role. To produce short (less that one day) orbital\nperiod systems with a low\u2013mass helium WD and a millisecond pulsar it is necessary that the secondary fills its Roche\nlobe between Pbif and Pb (Ergma, Sarna & Antipova, 1998).\nIf the initial orbital period Pi (at RLOF) is less than Pbif ,\nthe binary system evolves towards short orbital periods. Pb\nis another critical orbital period value. If Pb < Pi (RLOF )\n< Pbif , then a short orbital period (< 1 day) millisecond\nbinary pulsar with low\u2013mass helium white dwarf may form.\nSo the initial conditions of the formation of such systems\nare rather important. We calculated one extra sequence to\nproduce a binary system with orbital parameters similar to\nPSR J1012+5307. Initial system: 1 + 1.4 M\u2299 , Pi (RLOF) =\n1.35 days, Z=0.01. Final system : Ms =0.168 M\u2299 , Pf =0.605\ndays, Menv =0.041 M\u2299 . In Fig. 11 in the effective temperature and gravity diagram we show the cooling history of\nthis white dwarf after detachment of the Roche lobe. The\ntwo horizontal regions are the gravity values inferred by van\nKerkwijk et al. (1996) (lower) and Callanan et al. (1998)\n(upper). Our results are consistent with the Callanan et al.\n(1998) estimates. It is necessary to mention that after detachment from its Roche lobe, the outer envelope is rather\nhelium\u2013rich. Bergeron et al. (1991) have shown that a small\namount of helium in a hydrogen\u2013dominated envelope can\nmimic the effect of a larger gravity.\n\n9\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe results of our evolutionary calculations differ from those\nof Iben & Tutukov (1986) and Driebe et al. (1998) because of\nthe different formation scenarios for low\u2013mass helium WDs.\nIn IT86's calculations a donor star fills its Roche lobe while\nit is on the red giant branch (i.e. has a thick convective\nenvelope) with a well developed helium core and a thin hydrogen burning layer. They proposed that the mass transfer\ntime scale is so short that the companion will not be able\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fCooling curves\n\n9\n\nFigure 10.

Left panel\nRLOF is not allowed, right panel with RLOF.\n\nto accrete the transferred matter and will itself expand and\noverflow its Roche lobe. The final output is the formation of\na common envelope and the result of this evolution is a close\nbinary with a helium WD of mass 0.298 M\u2299 having a rather\nthin (1.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 ) hydrogen\u2013rich (X=0.5) envelope.\nDSBH98 did not calculate the mass exchange phases\nduring the red giant branch evolution in detail but they also\nsimulated the mass\u2013exchange episode by subjecting a red\ngiant branch model to a sufficiently large mass loss rate. In\nboth cases (IT86 and DSBH98) mass loss starts when the\nstar (with a well developed helium core) is on the red giant\nbranch.\nIn our calculations the Roche lobe overflow starts when\nthe secondary has either almost exhausted hydrogen in the\ncenter of the star or has a very small helium core with a thick\nhydrogen burning layer. During the semi\u2013detached evolution\nthe mass of the helium core increases from almost nothing to\nfinal value (for more detail about evolution of such systems,\nsee Ergma, Sarna & Antipova, 1998). This is the reason that\na much thicker (\u223c [1.5 \u2212 6] \u00d7 10\u22122 M\u2299 , with X ranging from\n0.30 to 0.52) hydrogen\u2013rich envelope is left on the donor star\nat the moment it shrinks within the Roche lobe.\nThe second important point where our results differ\nfrom that of DSBH98 is that in our calculations we can\nproduce (after the secondary detaches from its Roche lobe)\nfinal millisecond binary pulsar parameters which we compare with observational data (orbital period, spin period of\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nms pulsar, mass of the companion). It was shown by Joss,\nRappaport & Lewis (1987) and more recently by Rappaport\net al. (1995) that the evolution of a binary system initially\ncomprising of a neutron star and a low\u2013mass giant will end\nup as a wide binary containing a radio pulsar and a white\ndwarf in a nearly circular orbit. The relation between the\nwhite dwarf mass and orbital period (see eq. (6) in Rappaport et al. 1995) shows that if the secondary fills its Roche\nlobe while on the red giant branch, then for Mwd \u2248 0.19M\u2299\nthe final orbital period would be \u223c 5 days, which is far from\nobserved orbital period of the binary pulsar PSR J 1012+\n5307 (Porb =0.6 days).\nAlberts et al. (1996), DSBH98, and the results of our\ncalculations demonstrate clearly that especially for low\u2013\nmass helium WDs (< 0.2 M\u2299 ) stationary hydrogen burning\nremains an important, if not the main, energy source. HP98\nand BA98 did consider nuclear burning but found it to be\nof little importance since their artificially chosen hydrogen\nenvelope mass was less than some critical value, disallowing\nsignificant hydrogen burning. If we compare now the cooling\ncurves of HP98, DSH98 with ours then there is one very important difference; they did not model the evolution of the\nhelium WD progenitor and all their cooling models (see for\nexample Figs. 11, 12 in HP98) start with a high Tef f . In our\nmodels, cooling of the helium WD starts after detachment\nof the secondary from its Roche lobe (DSBH98 mimic this\nsituation with mass loss from the star). This time, the sec-\n\n\f10\n\nMarek J. Sarna et al.\nREFERENCES\n\nFigure 11. log g \u2013 log Tef f diagram with Mwd = 0.168 M\u2299 . The\narrow marks the position of the PSR J1012+5307 white dwarf.\nTwo horizontal regions are the gravity values inferred by Callanan\net al. (1998) (upper) and van Kerkwijk et al. (1996) (lower). The\nvertical lines show effective temperature constraints of Callanan\net al. (1998)\n\nondary (proto\u2013white dwarf) has rather low effective temperature (see for example Fig.1). During the evolution with L\napproximately constant, the effective temperature increases\nto a maximum value, after which it decreases while still having a active hydrogen shell burning source. The evolutionary time needed for the proto\u2013white dwarf to travel from\nthe minimum Tef f (after detachment from Roche lobe) to\nmaximum Tef f depends strongly on mass of the WD (for a\nsmaller mass a longer evolutionary time\u2013scale).\nSo for low\u2013mass helium WDs the evolutionary prehistory plays a very important role in cooling history of the\nwhite dwarf.\n\n10\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have performed comprehensive evolutionary calculations\nto produce a close binary system consisting of a NS and a\nlow\u2013mass helium WD.\nWe argue that the presence of a thick hydrogen layer\nchanges dramatically the cooling time\u2013scale of the helium\nwhite dwarf (< 0.25 M\u2299 ), compared to the previous calculations (HP98, BA98) where the mass of the hydrogen\nenvelope was chosen as free parameter and was usually one\norder of magnitude less than that obtained from real binary\nevolution computations.\nAlso, we have demonstrated that using new cooling\ntracks we can consistently explain the evolutionary status\nof the binary pulsar PSR J1012+53.\nTables with cooling curves are available on\nhttp://www.camk.edu.pl/\u223csarna/.\n\nAlberts F., Savonije G.
