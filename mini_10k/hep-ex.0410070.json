Radiative effects enter the measurement of |Vus | in two distinct ways. First, |Vus |\nis extracted from the semileptonic decay rate \u0393Kl3 =\nBorn\n\u0393Born\nis the\nKl3 \u00d7 (1 + \u03b4rad ), where l = e or \u03bc, \u0393Kl3\n2\nBorn-level decay rate proportional to |Vus | , and \u03b4rad describes radiative corrections. In our extraction of |Vus | [1]\nl\n(1 + \u03b4rad ) = SEW (1 + \u03b4K\n), where SEW is the shortdistance radiative correction taken from [2], and the\nl\nklor program [3] is used to determine \u03b4K\n. The second\nrole of radiative effects is in the Monte Carlo simulation\n(MC) that is used to determine the detector acceptance\nneeded to measure the Kl3 branching fractions and form\nfactors. A Monte Carlo simulation requires a precise un-\n\n\u2217 Permanent\n\naddress: University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\n\n\u2020 Deceased.\n\u2021 Permanent\n\naddress: C.P.P. Marseille/C.N.R.S., France\n\nderstanding of the kinematic distributions, particularly\nthe photon energy spectrum and the angle between the\ncharged lepton and photon. The sensitivity of the MC to\nradiative effects depends on the experimental technique.\nFor the KTeV measurements [4, 5], radiative effects in\nthe simulation change the Ke3 branching fraction by a\nfew percent, and have a more significant impact on the\nform factors. The klor program that is used to deterl\nmine \u03b4K\nis also used to generate KL \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 l\u2213 \u03bd(\u03b3) decays\nin our Monte Carlo simulation, and to predict radiative\nsemileptonic branching fractions.\nTo test our understanding of radiative semileptonic decays, we measure\nRKl3\u03b3 \u2261\n\n\u0393(KL \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 l\u2213 \u03bd\u03b3; E\u03b3\u22c6 > 10 MeV)\n,\n\u0393(KL \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 l\u2213 \u03bd)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere l = e or \u03bc, and E\u03b3\u22c6 is the photon energy in the\nkaon rest frame. The denominator in Eq. (1) is the Kl3\ndecay rate which includes the emission of one or more\nradiated photons [15]. We also measure distributions of\n\u22c6\nE\u03b3\u22c6 and the angle (\u03b8\u03b3l\n) between the photon and charged\nlepton.\nPrevious Kl3\u03b3 analyses selected E\u03b3\u22c6 > 30 MeV; for\n\n\f2\n\u22c6\nKe3\u03b3 , an additional angular cut, \u03b8\u03b3e\n> 200 , was also\nrequired. In this analysis, we select events with E\u03b3\u22c6 >\n\u22c6\n10 MeV and remove the \u03b8\u03b3l\nrequirement; these relaxed cuts allow us to study 5 times more radiated photons for KL \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 e\u2213 \u03bd\u03b3, and 2.5 times more photons for\nKL \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03bc\u2213 \u03bd\u03b3.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. Section II describes the theoretical treatment used to generate radiative effects in semileptonic decays. The KTeV apparatus\nis described in Sec. III, the RKl3\u03b3 analyses are presented\nin Sec. IV, and systematic uncertainties are discussed in\nSec. V. Section VI describes the acceptance correction,\nas well as a correction from second-order radiative effects.\nFinally, results are presented in Sec. VII.\n\nII.\n\nTREATMENT OF RADIATIVE DECAYS\n\nIn our Monte Carlo simulation, we use the klor program to generate both radiative and non-radiative Kl3\nevents. klor models first-order radiative corrections to\nthe Kl3 decay mode using a phenomenological model\n[3, 6, 7]; below we give a brief description of this program. Second-order radiative effects are estimated using\nthe photos program [8], and are discussed in Sec. VI B.\nFirst-order radiative corrections are composed of both\ninner-bremsstrahlung (IB) and virtual contributions.\nFigure 1(g)\u2013(i) shows the IB contribution consisting of\nradiation from the pion, the charged lepton, and the vertex [16]. Data-MC comparisons of the kinematic dis\u22c6\n) are pretributions for radiated photons (E\u03b3\u22c6 and \u03b8\u03b3l\nsented in Sec. VII C. Figure 1(a)\u2013(f) illustrates the virtual corrections that involve the emission and absorption of a photon by the pion, the charged lepton, or\nthe effective vertex. The effects of virtual photon exchange are most prominent in the distributions of the\npion-lepton mass (m\u03c0l ), and the transverse momentum\nof each charged particle (pT ). Using klor, data-MC\ncomparisons in these distributions show good agreement\n(Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 in [4]).\nRadiative corrections to Kl3 decays depend on the\nhadronic K\u2013\u03c0 form factors. The form factors depend on\nt, the square of the four-momentum transfer to the gauge\nboson (W \u00b1 ). This four-momentum squared is given by\nt1 = (pl +p\u03bd )2 when the photon is radiated from the pion,\nand by t2 = (pK \u2212 p\u03c0 )2 when the photon is radiated from\nthe charged lepton. Note that t1 = t2 without radiation,\nbut differ when radiation is included. The t-dependence\nof the form factors is obtained from our measurements\nin [4].\nIn the klor program, the virtual and innerbremsstrahlung matrix elements are evaluated numerically. Numerical integration of the squared matrix elel\n, and\nments over the phase space gives predictions for \u03b4K\nalso for the radiative branching fractions, RKl3\u03b3 . The\nvirtual matrix elements are integrated over three-body\nphase space, and the IB matrix elements are integrated\nover four-body phase space. Comparison of the predicted\n\nand measured radiative branching fractions are presented\nin Sec. VII.\nIII.\n\nDETECTOR AND DATA COLLECTION\n\nAn 800 GeV proton beam incident on a berylliumoxide target produces neutral kaons. A collimation\nsystem results in two parallel neutral beams beginning\n90 meters from the beryllium target; each beam consists\nof roughly equal numbers of kaons and neutrons. The\nfiducial decay region is 123-158 meters from the target,\nand the vacuum region extends from 20-159 meters.\nThe KTeV detector (Fig. 2) is located downstream of\nthe decay region. A spectrometer consisting of four drift\nchambers, two upstream and two downstream of a dipole\nmagnet, measures the momentum of charged particles;\nthe resolution is \u03c3p /p \u2243 [1.7 \u2295 (p/14)] \u00d7 10\u22123 , where p is\nthe track momentum in GeV/c. Downstream of the spectrometer lies a scintillator \"trigger hodoscope,\" which is\nused to trigger on charged particles. Farther downstream\nthere is an electromagnetic calorimeter made of 3100 pure\nCesium Iodide (CsI) crystals [see Fig. (3)]. For photons\nand electrons, the energy resolution is better than 1%\nand the position resolution is about 1 mm. The CsI\ncalorimeter has two holes to allow the neutral beams\nto pass through without interacting. Two scintillator\n\"muon hodoscopes,\" behind 4 and 5 meters of steel, are\nused to detect muons. The downstream muon hodoscope\nconsists of horizontal (MUH) and vertical (MUV) coun-\n\n(a)\n\n\u03c0-\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\n(f )\n\n(g)\n\n(h)\n\n(i)\n\n\u03b3\nK0\n\nl+\n\n\u03bd\n\nFIG. 1:\nFeynman diagrams for the first-order radiative\ncorrections to the Kl3 decay mode.

Eight photon-veto\ndetectors along the decay region and spectrometer reject events with escaping particles. The trigger for both\nsemileptonic decay modes requires a few hits in the drift\nchambers upstream of the magnet, and at least two hits\nin the trigger hodoscope.\nA Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine the\nacceptance for the Kl3 and Kl3\u03b3 decay modes. klor\nis used to generate semileptonic decays as discussed in\nSec. II. For the generation of inner-bremsstrahlung with\nklor, the photon energy cutoff in the kaon rest frame\nis 3.5 keV. This cutoff results in a minimum lab photon\nenergy of a few hundred keV, which is below the energy\nfor which photons affect the detector acceptance. The\nfraction of Kl3 decays with a photon above the 3.5 keV\ncutoff is 21% for Ke3 , and 3.7% for K\u03bc3 .\nEach of the decay products (pion, lepton, photon) is traced through the detector, including the effects of multiple scattering, energy loss from ionization,\nbremsstrahlung for electrons, e+ e\u2212 pair-production for\nphotons, secondary decays for pions, and pions that interact hadronically in the detector. The effects of accidental activity are included by overlaying events from\na trigger that recorded random activity in the detector\nthat is proportional to the instantaneous intensity of the\nproton beam.\nIn addition to detailed tracing of the decay products,\nthe KTeV MC also treats the detector response in great\ndetail, particularly the drift chamber inefficiencies and\ndetector resolutions. A detailed discussion of the simulation is given in [9].\nThe semileptonic samples presented here were collected\nduring a one-day run in 1997 in which the incident proton beam intensity was reduced to 10% of the nominal\nintensity used to measure \u01eb\u2032/\u01eb [9]. The regenerator, which\nwas used to generate KS in the \u01eb\u2032/\u01eb measurement, was\nremoved from the beamline resulting in two KL beams.\nNote that this low-intensity sample is the same as that\nused for the Kl3 form-factor measurements [4].\nIV.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nThe analysis strategy is first to identify a Kl3 decay\n(Sec. IV A), and then search for an extra photon in the\nCsI calorimeter (Sec. IV B). The photon selection is optimized to reduce background from semileptonic events\nwith a fake photon cluster, and also from other KL decays (mainly KL \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) which are misidentified as\nKl3\u03b3 . Kinematic requirements on the pion-lepton system\nfor Kl3 candidates are also applied to the pion-leptonphoton system for Kl3\u03b3 candidates.\n\nA.\n\nKL \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 l\u2213 \u03bd Selection\n\nThe first step in the semileptonic decay reconstruction\nis to identify the charged pion and lepton. The spectrom-\n\neter is used to find two charged tracks. For each track,\nthe momentum is required to be above 8 GeV/c, and a\ncluster in the CsI calorimeter is required to be near the\ntrack-projection at the CsI. If the cluster energy (E) divided by the track momentum(p) is greater then 0.92, the\ntrack is identified as an electron; this cut retains 99.8%\nof the electrons and rejects 99.5% of the pions. If the\ncorresponding E/p value is less then 0.85, and the track\ndoes not point to a hit muon counter, the track is identified as a pion; this cut retains 99.1% of the pions and\nrejects 99.93% of the electrons. A muon track candidate\nmust have momentum above 10 GeV/c, point near a hit\ncounter in both MUH and MUV [17], and be matched to\na CsI cluster with energy less than 2 GeV (five times the\naverage energy deposit). Events consisting of either \"\u03c0\u03bc\"\nor \"\u03c0e\" candidates are selected. Note that \u03c0e candidates\nare vetoed by activity in the muon hodoscopes.\nAfter particle identification, but before kinematic\nrequirements, there is a small background from\nKL \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 (K3\u03c0 ) decays in which the \u03c0 0 -photons\ndo not fire a photon veto, and a pion either decays or is\nmis-identified as an electron. At this intermediate stage\nof the analysis, the K3\u03c0 background is 0.5% in the \u03c0\u03bc\n(K\u03bc3 ) sample and 0.1% in the \u03c0e (Ke3 ) sample. When a\nradiated photon cluster is required in the CsI calorimeter\n(see below), the K3\u03c0 background increases significantly:\n67% background in the K\u03bc3\u03b3 sample, and almost 10% in\nthe Ke3\u03b3 sample. To suppress K3\u03c0 background, a kinematic variable is used which distinguishes decays with\na missing \u03c0 0 from decays with a missing neutrino; we\nrequire k+\u22120 < \u22120.00625 [18] for the \u03c0e sample, and\nk+\u22120 < \u22120.01 for the \u03c0\u03bc sample.\nFor reconstructed Kl3 decays with a missing neutrino,\nthere is a twofold ambiguity in determining the kaon energy (EK ). Both EK solutions are required to satisfy\nthe 40-160 GeV range for which the energy spectrum is\nwell measured [19]. For reconstructed decays in which\nthe true kaon energy is between 40 and 160 GeV, 20%\nof these events are rejected by the requirement on both\nkaon energy solutions.\nAfter these selection requirements, there are 1691400\nK\u03bc3 and 2191077 Ke3 candidates. The background in\neach Kl3 mode is \u223c 10\u22124 , and is ignored.\n\nB.\n\nKL \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 l\u2213 \u03bd\u03b3 Selection\n\nAfter finding a pion and lepton track that satisfy kinematics for either of the Kl3 decays, we search for a photon in the CsI calorimeter. A candidate radiated photon\nfrom a KL \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 l\u2213 \u03bd\u03b3 decay is a single CsI cluster with\nenergy above 3 GeV and a transverse profile consistent\nwith a photon (Appendix A). To have a well-defined acceptance, the photon position must not lie in a crystal\nadjacent to the beam-hole, and must also lie away from\nthe outer edge of the calorimeter (Fig. 3). To avoid overlapping clusters in the CsI, the photon cluster is required\nto be at least 20 cm from the lepton and at least 40 cm\n\n\f4\n\nDrift\nChambers\n(DC1-DC4)\n\nTrigger\nHodoscope\n\nMuon\nSystem\nCsI\n\nx (m)\n\n1\nNeutral\n0\nBeams\n-1\nMask\nVeto\nVacuum\nVeto\n120\n\nSpectro\nVeto\n\nAnalysis\nMagnet\n\nCsI\nVeto\n\nSteel\n\n140\n160\n180\nz (m) = distance from kaon production target\n\nFIG. 2: Plan view of the KTeV (E832) detector. The evacuated decay volume ends with a thin vacuum window at Z = 159 m.\nKL decays from the two neutral beams are the source of semileptonic decays.\n\nfrom the pion.\nAs with Kl3 decays, Kl3\u03b3 decays have two kaon energy solutions, both of which must pass the 40-160 GeV\nrequirement. Similarly, both E\u03b3\u22c6 solutions must be above\n10 MeV. For both Kl3 and Kl3\u03b3 , the square of the reconstructed neutrino momentum is required to be greater\nthan zero.\nAfter finding a single photon cluster in the CsI, there is\nbackground from KL \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decays, and from Kl3\ndecays with a fake photon cluster; methods to reduce\nthese backgrounds are described below. Kaon decays\nother than KL \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 contribute negligible background.\n\n1.\n\n1.9 m\nFIG. 3: Layout of CsI calorimeter. The small crystals (inner\nregion) have dimension 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 50 cm3 ; the large crystals\n(outer region) have dimension 5.0 \u00d7 5.0 \u00d7 50 cm3 . The two\nneutral beams go through the beam holes (into page) shown\nby the two inner squares. The fiducial cut, indicated by the\ndark lines, excludes radiated photons that hit a crystal near\nthe beam holes or near the outer boundary\n\nBackground from Misidentified KL Decays\n\nBackground from KL \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decays arises when\none of the \u03c0 0 photons is not detected, and a charged\npion either decays or is misidentified as an electron. As\ndiscussed in Sec. IV A, this K3\u03c0 background is suppressed\nby the k+\u22120 requirement. Figure 4 shows the k+\u22120 distribution for both Kl3\u03b3 samples; after the k+\u22120 requirement, the K3\u03c0 background is (4.39 \u00b1 1.75)% in the K\u03bc3\u03b3\nsample, and less than 0.01% in the Ke3\u03b3 sample. The\n40% relative uncertainty in the K3\u03c0 background is based\non the data-MC discrepancy in the background region\nshown in Fig. 4(b).\nBackgrounds from other kaon decays (Ke4 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3)\nare simulated and normalized according to their branching fractions.

Pion Hadron Interactions: If a \u03c0-hadron interaction leaves a fake photon candidate, there are usually\nadditional clusters in the CsI calorimeter with transverse\nprofiles inconsistent with a photon. We therefore veto\nevents that have an extra CsI cluster with energy above\n1 GeV, and a transverse profile inconsistent with a photon. To avoid vetoing on satellite clusters from the pion\nshower in the CsI, we veto an event only if the extra cluster lies at least 30 cm away from the pion. This extra\ncluster veto is required in both the Kl3 and Kl3\u03b3 samples.\nThe \u03c0-hadron interaction background is reduced further by requiring the photon cluster candidate to lie at\nleast 40 cm away from the pion at the CsI. The background level is (1.60\u00b10.32)% for K\u03bc3\u03b3 , and (0.54\u00b10.11)%\nfor Ke3\u03b3 . The uncertainty on this background is explained in Appendix C.\n\n2. Accidental Cluster: To prevent an accidental cluster\nfrom faking a radiative photon, we use the energy-vs-time\nprofiles recorded by the CsI calorimeter. For each radiated photon candidate, the CsI cluster energy deposited\nbefore the event must be consistent with pedestal, and\nthe energy deposited in the first RF bucket [20] must\nbe well above pedestal (Fig. 5). These two requirements\non the energy-vs-time profile reduce the accidental background by a factor of ten, resulting in accidental background contributions of (1.68 \u00b1 0.89)% for K\u03bc3\u03b3 , and\n(0.22 \u00b1 0.11)% for Ke3\u03b3 . The relatively large error on\nthe accidental background is because of the low statistics\nof the accidental event sample used to include accidental\nactivity in the MC.\n3. External bremsstrahlung (Ke3 only): A photon from\nexternal bremsstrahlung upstream of the magnet is separated from the electron at the CsI calorimeter, and is\ntherefore a source of fake photon clusters. Note that\nexternal bremsstrahlung downstream of the magnet results in a photon that lies on top of the electron at the\nCsI calorimeter, and therefore does not result in background. To remove events with a photon produced by\nexternal bremsstrahlung upstream of the magnet (which\n\u22c6\nwould fake Ke3\u03b3 with \u03b8\u03b3e\n\u223c 00 ), the photon candidate\nis required to be at least 2 cm away from the CsI position corresponding to the electron track projection from\nupstream of the magnet [see \u2206R\u03b3\u2212brem in Fig. 6]. This\nbackground is (0.20 \u00b1 0.02)%.\n\n3.\n\nBackground Summary\n\nThe backgrounds for both Kl3\u03b3 modes are summarized\nin Table I. The total background level is (7.91 \u00b1 1.99)%\nfor K\u03bc3\u03b3 and (1.04 \u00b1 0.16)% for Ke3\u03b3 .

The main sources of systematic uncertainty are related to Kl3\u03b3 background, the efficiency of reconstructing\na radiated photon, and the aperture for photons. These\nsystematic uncertainties are discussed below.\nBackground: For RK\u03bc3\u03b3 , the background contributes\n1.99% uncertainty, mostly from KL \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decays;\nfor RKe3\u03b3 the corresponding uncertainty is 0.16%,\nmainly from Ke3 with a false photon cluster.\nExtra Cluster Veto:\nRemoving the extra cluster\nveto requirement changes RK\u03bc3\u03b3 by \u22120.60% and changes\nRKe3\u03b3 by +0.58%; these changes are included as uncertainties in RKl3\u03b3 .\nCsI Energy Scale: The CsI energy scale is calibrated\nto better than 0.1%, and results in a 0.1% uncertainty\nfor both RKl3\u03b3 ratios.\nPhoton Aperture and Beamline Material: The beamhole aperture is studied with electrons from Ke3 decays.\nThe effective size is known to \u00b1200 \u03bcm, leading to a 0.1%\nuncertainty for both RKl3\u03b3 ratios. The same 200 \u03bcm\nuncertainty affects the \u2206R\u03b3\u2212brem requirement, resulting\nin a 0.30% uncertainty in RKe3\u03b3 , and less than 0.01%\nuncertainty in RK\u03bc3\u03b3 .\nPhoton Inefficiency: Three sources of photon inefficiency are considered: \u03b3 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 conversions in detector material, CsI readout, and the transverse profile requirement. A photon traverses 4% of a radiation\nlength through the KTeV detector before reaching the\nCsI calorimeter, and this results in a 1% reconstruction\nloss for the radiated photon. Based on the data-MC\nagreement in the first two bins of Fig. 6, the amount\nof material is known to better than 10%, resulting in a\nsystematic uncertainty of 0.1% on RKl3\u03b3 . The CsI readout efficiency is studied with events in which light from\na laser is distributed to each crystal via 3100 fibers, and\nmuons are used to check dead material (wrapping) between the crystals; this results in a 0.01% uncertainty.\nThe inefficiency of the transverse profile requirement is\n\nEntries per 10 MeV\n\n(a)\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nmax cos(\u03b8\u03bc\u03b3*)\n\nFIG. 7: For KL \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03bc\u2213 \u03bd\u03b3 candidates without background\n\u22c6\nsubtraction, (a) minimum E\u03b3\u22c6 and (b) maximum cos(\u03b8\u03b3e\n) for\nthe two kinematic solutions. Dots are data, and dashed histogram is the background predicted by the MC.\n\n\f7\ndiscussed in Appendix A, resulting in a systematic uncertainty of 0.2% for Ke3\u03b3 , and 0.06% for K\u03bc3\u03b3 .\nMuon Hodoscope Efficiency: In the MC, if muon scattering in the steel is turned off and gaps between the\nmuon system counters are ignored, RK\u03bc3\u03b3 changes by\n2%. Using the nominal MC that includes scattering and\ngaps, we compare data and MC distributions of the distance between the track extrapolation and the hit muon\nsystem counters; this comparison shows that muon propagation through the steel is described to better than 20%\nprecision, leading to a systematic uncertainty of 0.4% on\nRK\u03bc3\u03b3 .\nRadiative Effects and Form Factors in Matrix Element:\nAs discussed in Sec VI B, the uncertainty in radiative effects is from second-order radiative correction; this leads\nto 0.5% uncertainty in RKl3\u03b3 . Variations in the form\nfactors measured by KTeV [4] lead to 0.1% uncertainty\non RKl3\u03b3 .\nThe uncertainties are summarized in Table II. The total systematic uncertainty is 2.36% for RK\u03bc3\u03b3 , and 0.92%\nfor RKe3\u03b3 . These systematic uncertainties are comparable to the statistical uncertainties.\n\nMonte Carlo simulation.

To see why second-order radiative effects are needed, consider the KL \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 e\u2213 \u03bd acceptance.

Note that this dependence on higher order\nradiative effects depends on the experimental apparatus.\nThe KTeV sensitivity is largely from the kinematic selection and the hermetic veto system with low thresholds\n(150 MeV).\nThe second-order radiative correction to the acceptance is estimated using photos [8], which allows for\nup to two radiated photons. We begin by generating\nMC with single-photon radiation from photos, and then\nreweight photos to match data distributions in the vari\u22c6\nables E\u03b3\u22c6 and \u03b8\u03b3l\n[21]. For two-photon generation with\nphotos, the reweighting is applied to the higher energy\nphoton. The correction to the radiative acceptance for\nsecond-order effects is given by\n\nA\u03b3\u03b3/\u03b3 \u2261 APHOTOS\u22122\u03b3 /APHOTOS\u22121\u03b3 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere APHOTOS\u22121,2\u03b3 is the acceptance determined with\nphotos using the option to allow up to 1 or 2 radiated photons. The final acceptance (AKl3\u03b3 ) is given by\nA\u03b3\u03b3/\u03b3 times the acceptance determined from the MC using klor [3].\nEvidence for a second radiated photon is seen in the\nphoton candidate multiplicity in the CsI calorimeter.\nThe photon multiplicity is checked for Kl3 candidates after requiring all photon identification requirements (cluster energy greater than 3 GeV, transverse shape, etc.),\nbut before Kl3\u03b3 kinematics are applied. The fraction of\nthese events with two photon candidates (\u03b7\u03b3\u03b3 ) is \u03b7\u03b3\u03b3 =\n(0.39 \u00b1 0.05)% in data. In our MC using the klor generator, events with two photon candidates are mostly from\naccidentals, and \u03b7\u03b3\u03b3 = (0.17 \u00b1 0.01)%. For MC using\nphotos with one radiated photon, \u03b7\u03b3\u03b3 = (0.18 \u00b1 0.01)%.\nThese MC generators (klor and photos) agree with\neach other, but disagree with the data. For MC using\nphotos with two radiated photons, \u03b7\u03b3\u03b3 = (0.36\u00b10.02)%;\nthis good agreement with data shows that photos provides a reasonable second-order correction to the acceptance.\nFor KL \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 e\u2213 \u03bd\u03b3, A\u03b3\u03b3/\u03b3 = 0.982 \u00b1 0.005 [22], where\nthe uncertainty comes from the limited statistics in the\ndata-MC comparison of events with two photon candidates. For KL \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03bc\u2213 \u03bd\u03b3, the two-photon candidates are consistent with accidentals, and A\u03b3\u03b3/\u03b3 is consistent with one. We therefore set A\u03b3\u03b3/\u03b3 = 1.0 for\nKL \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03bc\u2213 \u03bd, but include an additional 0.5% uncertainty on RK\u03bc3\u03b3 .\n\nVII.\nA.\n\nRESULTS\n\nKL \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03bc\u2213 \u03bd\u03b3 Branching Fraction\n\nFor the muonic semileptonic decay mode, the radiative\nbranching fraction is\nRK\u03bc3\u03b3 (E\u03b3\u22c6 > 10 MeV) =\n= [0.530 \u00b1 0.014(stat) \u00b1 0.012(syst)]%\n= [0.530 \u00b1 0.019]% .\n(5)\nThe only previous measurement of this radiative mode\n[10] required E\u03b3\u22c6 > 30 MeV.

The current KTeV\nresult is based on 4309 candidates, which is less than 1/3\nof the KTeV 01 sample [23].

The new analysis reported here\n\u22c6\n(with E\u03b3\u22c6 > 30 MeV and \u03b8\u03b3e\n> 200 ) therefore has comparable precision with our earlier result, yet these two\nKTeV results are largely uncorrelated. The new KTeV\nresult (Eq. (11)) supersedes the previous result [12] so\nthat our radiative branching fractions are all based on\nthe same analysis method. Figure 10(b) compares the\nmeasurements in Eqs (9\u201311) with theory predictions.

The uncertainty in the acceptance from radiative effects is based on\nthe agreement between our measurements of RKl3\u03b3 and\nthe predictions from klor [3]. Specifically, this uncertainty is taken to be the measurement-prediction difference, plus the quadrature-sum of the experimental and\ntheoretical uncertainties (from Tables III and IV ).\nFor KL \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03bc\u2213 \u03bd\u03b3, with E\u03b3\u22c6 > 10 MeV, the uncertainty in our treatment of radiative effects is evaluated\nto be 10.1%; with E\u03b3\u22c6 > 30 MeV, this uncertainty is\n6.7%. For KL \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 e\u2213 \u03bd\u03b3, with E\u03b3\u22c6 > 10 MeV, the corresponding uncertainty is 1.9%; with E\u03b3\u22c6 > 30 MeV and\n\u22c6\n\u03b8\u03b3e\n> 200 , the uncertainty is 6.4%. From these datatheory comparisons, which are all consistent, we assign\nthe average uncertainty of 6% on klor's treatment of\nradiative effects.\nThe generated phase space distributions from klor\nare important in the form factor measurements [4], and\nalso in the RKl3\u03b3 measurements (Eq. (1)). The klor\ngenerator is checked by comparing data and MC distributions for the photon energy (E\u03b3\u22c6 ) and for the angle be\u22c6\ntween the photon and charged lepton (\u03b8\u03b3l\n). Figures 11\nand 12 show these data-MC comparisons for K\u03bc3\u03b3 and\nKe3\u03b3 , respectively. Data and MC agree well in all cases,\nas indicated by the \u03c72 /dof . The data-MC comparison\nof the pion-photon angle (not shown) also agrees well for\nboth radiative decay modes.

A pion and muon\ntrack are searched using the two-track analysis described\nin Sec. IV A. To increase the acceptance, requirements\non the decay vertex and kaon energy are relaxed. Next,\nwe search for two photons in the CsI calorimeter such\nthat the two-photon invariant mass is consistent with\nthe \u03c0 0 mass. This sample of \"\u03c0 0 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03bc\u2213 \" candidates is\nmainly background from KL \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decays in which\none of the pions decays into a muon plus neutrino. To reduce this background, the muon-neutrino invariant mass\n(m\u03bc\u03bd ) is computed for both kaon energy solutions, and\nboth m\u03bc\u03bd solutions are required to be well away from\nthe charged pion mass. A KL \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03bc\u2213 \u03bd candidate is\ndefined such that the m\u03bc\u03bd solution closest to the pion\nmass (m\u2032\u03bc\u03bd ) is between 170 and 210 MeV/c2 . Figure 13a\nshows the m\u2032\u03bc\u03bd distribution; the data are shown as dots,\nand KL \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 MC is shown by the histogram. For\ndata, there are no events in the signal region; the background prediction from KL \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 MC describes the\ndata well. Figure 13b shows the m\u2032\u03bc\u03bd distribution for\n\nA potential background for Kl3\u03b3 is a non-radiative\nKl3 decay in which the pion interacts hadronically in\nthe material upstream of the CsI and generates a CsI\ncluster that satisfies the photon identification cuts. In\nthis appendix, we first describe how this effect is simulated, and then use KL,S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events to measure the\nfake-photon probability in both the data and simulation.\nThe effects of \u03c0-hadron interactions are simulated with\na geant-based library that stores hadronic secondaries\nproduced from pion interactions. When a charged pion\nis traced through the detector in the KTeV MC, the\nhadronic interaction probability is computed for each detector element. To simulate a \u03c0-hadron interaction, a\nshower is selected from the geant library based on the\npion momentum, and the secondaries are traced through\nthe detector.\nTo check the simulation of hadronic showers, we measure the fake-photon probability for KL,S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays. This decay mode is ideal because simple kinematic cuts (see below) remove events with radiative photons, and therefore any extra cluster in the CsI calorime-\n\n\f400\n350\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n\n(a)\n\nData\nMC\nMC without \u03c0-hadron\ninteractions\n\n0\nEntries per GeV\n\nter must be from a hadronic interaction. To have sufficient statistics, we use the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 sample from the\nRe(\u01eb\u2032/\u01eb) analysis[9]. For this data sample, a regenerator placed in one of the beams was used to generate KS ;\nKL,S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays from both beams are used in this\nstudy. The regenerator veto is used to suppress accidental photon clusters arising from interactions of the neutral beam in the regenerator. Very tight requirements\nare made on the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass (495-502 MeV/c2 )\nand transverse momentum (p2t < 10\u22124 GeV2 /c2 ) to ensure that photons from radiative KL,S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 are well\nbelow the 3 GeV cluster-energy requirement.\nTo remove events in which both pions undergo a\nhadronic shower, one of the pions is required to deposit\nenergy in only one CsI crystal (compared with 49 crystals used to sum energy for photon showers), and no other\ncluster is allowed to lie within 30 cm of this \"non-shower\ncluster.\" The probability for a pion to satisfy this nonshower requirement is 10%; the event is rejected if both\npions satisfy the non-shower requirement. Finally, to reduce accidentals, the regenerator veto is applied during\na 150 ns window (8 RF buckets) centered on the event\nstart time.\nAfter the selection criteria described above, there are\n4.7 \u00d7 106 KL,S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 candidates. Using this sample,\nphoton cluster candidates are searched for using the same\ncriteria as in the Kl3\u03b3 analysis. Figure 14a shows the\n\u03c0-cluster separation at the CsI calorimeter; the enhancement below 40 cm is from \u03c0-hadron interactions. After the 40 cm \u03c0-cluster separation requirement, Fig. 14b\nshows the energy distribution for CsI clusters that satisfy the Kl3\u03b3 photon requirements. The MC prediction\nis also shown after normalizing the MC to have the same\nnumber of KL,S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events as the data. Since 98%\nof the photon clusters above 6 GeV are from accidentals (dashed histogram in Fig 14b), this analysis uses\nphoton cluster candidates with energy between 3 and\n6 GeV. With this additional cluster energy requirement,\nthe fraction of KL,S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 candidates satisfying the\nKl3\u03b3 photon requirements is (7.62 \u00b1 0.40) \u00d7 10\u22125 in data,\nand (8.06 \u00b1 0.29) \u00d7 10\u22125 in MC. According to the MC,\n60% of the events with extra clusters are due to accidental\nactivity and the remaining 40% is from pion interactions\nupstream of the CsI. Note that the effect of accidentals\nis more significant in this KL,S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 sample because\nthe beam intensity is much higher compared to the sample used to measure RKl3\u03b3 . Assuming no uncertainty in\nthe accidental contribution for KL,S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , the relative error on the contribution from \u03c0-hadron interactions\nis 20%.\n\nEntries per 5 cm\n\n12\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n\u03b3-\u03c0 separation at CsI (m)\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n200\n\n(b)\n\n175\n\nData\nMC\nMC without \u03c0-hadron\ninteractions\n\n150\n125\n100\n75\n50\n25\n0\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nCsI cluster energy (GeV)\n\nFIG. 14: For reconstructed KL,S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays with an\nextra cluster that satisfies the Kl3\u03b3 photon identification requirements, (a) \u03c0-\u03b3 separation at CsI (with separation cut\nremoved) and (b) photon energy distribution.
