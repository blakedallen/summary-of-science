In the usual\nHamiltonian formalism it is assumed that asymptotic fields are related with\ninteracting fields by unitary transformation. Haag's theorem shows that in accordance with Lorentz invariance of the theory the interacting fields are also\ntrivial which means that corresponding S-matrix is equal to unity. So the usual\ninteraction representation can not exist in the Lorentz invariant theory. Let\nus recall that Haag's theorem considers two theories, in which quantum field\noperators at equal time as well as corresponding vacuum states \u03a8i0 are related\nby the unitary operator:\n\u03c62f (t) = V \u03c61f (t)V \u22121\n\u03a820 = CV \u03a810 ,\n\nC \u2208 C,\n\n|C| = 1\n\n(1)\n\nIn accordance with the Haag's theorem four first Wightman functions coincide\nin two theories in usual Lorentz invariant case [1, 2]. Let us recall that by\ndefinition Wightman functions are:\nW = W (x1 , . . . , xn ) = (\u03a80 , \u03c6 (x1 ) . . . \u03c6 (xn )\u03a80 )\n1\n\n(2)\n\n\fThe main consequence of the Haag's theorem is that from triviality of one\nof the fields in question it follows that other one is trivial too, which implies\nthat corresponding S-matrix is equal to unity. It is known that in axiomatic\nquantum field theory (QFT) there is no field operator defined in a point. Only\nthe smoothed operators written symbolically as\nZ\n\u03c6f = \u03c6 (t, x)f (x) d3 x dt,\nwhere f (x) are test functions, can be rigorously defined.\nIn the formulation of Haag's theorem it is assumed that the formal operators\n\u03c6 (t, x) can be smeared only on the spatial variables.\nIn S O (1, k) invariant theory, where k \u2208 N, it was proved that in two theories\nrelated by a unitary transformation the first k + 1 Whigtman functions coincide\n[3]. Thus in SO(1, 1) invariant theory, the most important example of which is\nnoncommutative quantum field theory, only the first two Wightman functions\ncoincide.\n\n2\n\nNoncommutative Quantum Field Theory\n\nNoncommutative quantum field theory (NC QFT) being one of the generalizations of standard QFT has been intensively developed during the past years (for\nreviews, see [4, 5]). The present development in this direction is connected with\nthe construction of noncommutative geometry [6] and new physical arguments\nin favour of such a generalization of QFT [7]. Essential interest in NC QFT is\nalso due the fact that in some cases it is a low-energy limit of string theory [8].\nThe simplest and at the same time most studied version of noncommutative\nfield theory is based on the following Heisenberg-like commutation relations\nbetween coordinates:\n[x\u0302\u03bc , x\u0302\u03bd ] = i\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd ,\n(3)\nwhere \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd is a constant antisymmetric matrix.\nIt is very important that NC QFT can be also formulated in commutative space, if we replace the usual product of quantum field operators (strictly\nspeaking, of the corresponding test functions) by the \u22c6- (Moyal-type) product\n[4, 5].\nLet us remind that the \u22c6-product is defined as\n\u0012\n\u0013n\n\u221e\nX\n1 i \u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u2202\n\u03c6(x)\u22c6\u03c6(y) = exp\n\u03c6(x)\u03c6(y) \u2261\n\u03c6(x)\u03c6(y)\n\u03b8\nn! 2\n\u2202x\u03bc \u2202y \u03bd\nn=0\n(4)\nEvidently the series in equation (4) has to be convergent.\nIt was shown [9] that this series is convergent if the corresponding test functions belong to one of the Gelfand-Shilov spaces S \u03b2 with \u03b2 < 21 . The similar\nresult was obtained also in [10]. Moreover, \u03c6(x)\u22c6\u03c6(y) belongs to the same space\nS \u03b2 as \u03c6(x) and \u03c6(y) [9].\n\u0012\n\ni \u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u2202\n\u03b8\n2\n\u2202x\u03bc \u2202y \u03bd\n\n\u0013\n\n2\n\n\fNoncommutative theories defined by Heisenberg-like commutation relations (3)\ncan be divided into two classes.\nThe first of them is the case of only space-space noncommutativity, that is\n\u03b80i = 0, time commutes with spatial coordinates.\nIt is known that this case is free from the problems with causality and\nunitarity [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] and in this case the main axiomatic results: CPT\nand spin-statistics theorems, Haag's theorem remain valid [16] - [19].\nLet us remind that if time commutes with spatial coordinates, then there\nexists one spatial coordinate, say x3 , which commutes with all others. Simple\ncalculations show that this result is valid also in a space with arbitrary even\nnumber of dimensions. Thus in space-space NC QFT we have two commuting\ncoordinates and two noncommuting coordinates. For simplicity we consider\nfour-dimensional case.\nIn the second case all coordinates, including time, are noncommuting.\nLet us proceed to the LCC in noncommutative space-space QFT.\nFirst let us recall this condition in commutative case. In the operator form\nthis condition is\n(5)\n[\u03c6f1 , \u03c6f2 ] = 0, if O1 \u223c O2 ,\nwhere O1 = supp f1 , O2 = supp f2 . The condition O1 \u223c O2 means that (x \u2212\ny)2 < 0 \u2200x \u2208 O1 and y \u2208 O2 .\nIn the noncommutative case we have the similar condition with respect to\ncommutative coordinates, thus now O1 \u223c O2 means that\n(x0 \u2212 y0 )2 \u2212 (x3 \u2212 y3 )2 < 0.\n\n3\n\n(6)\n\nHaag's theorem in space-space NC QFT\n\nLet us recall that in NC QFT Lorentz invariance is broken up to SO (1, 1) \u2297\nSO (2) symmetry [16]. As was already mentioned, in two SO (1, 1) invariant theories related by a unitary transformation, only two-point Wightman functions\ncoincide.\nIn what follows we prove that if one of considered theories is trivial, that\nis the corresponding S-matrix is equal to unity, then another is trivial too. To\nprove this in S O(1, 1) invariant theory it is sufficient that the spectral condition, which implies non existence of tachyons, is valid only in respect with\ncommutative coordinates that is\nPi0 \u2265 |Pi3 |\n\n(7)\n\nfor arbitrary state.\nAlso it is sufficient that translation invariance is valid only in respect with the\ncommutative coordinates.\nLet us point out that in case the spectral condition (7) and S O(1, 1) symmetry are fulfilled, Wightman functions are analytical functions in two-dimensional\nanalog of extended tubes [19].\n\n3\n\n\fThe equality of two-point Wightman functions in two theories leads to the\nfollowing conclusion: if local commutativity condition in respect with commutative coordinates is fulfilled and the current in one of the theories is equal to\nzero, then another current is zero as well.\nIndeed as W1 (x1 , x2 ) = W2 (x1 , x2 ), then also\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0010\n(8)\n\u03a810 , jf1 \u0304jf1 \u03a810 = \u03a820 , jf2 \u0304jf2 \u03a820\nwhere\n\u0001\njfi = \u0003 + m2 \u03c6if .\n\nIf, for example, jf1 = 0, then in the space with positive metric\njf2 \u03a820 = 0\n\n(9)\n\nFrom the latter formula, corresponding analytical properties of Wightman functions, and local commutativity condition (5) it follows [2] that\njf2 \u2261 0\n\n(10)\n\nOur statement is proved.\n\n4\n\nHaag's Theorem in General Case\n\nNow let us consider the general case, when all coordinates, including time, do\nnot commute. Let us stress that NC QFT in general case is SO (1, 1) invariant\nas well as in the case of space-space noncommutativity [16].\nIn fact our derivation is valid in any theory with SO (1, 1) symmetry, if\ncorresponding test functions belong to one of the Gelfand-Shilov space S \u03b2 with\n\u03b2 < 21 .\nWightman functions in noncommutative theory take the following form with\nthe Moyal-type product:\nW\u22c6 (x1 , . . . , xn ) = (\u03a80 , \u03c6(x1 ) \u22c6 * * * \u22c6 \u03c6(xn )\u03a80 )\n\n(11)\n\nCorresponding generalized function on Gelfand- Shilov space S \u03b2 acts as\nZ\nW (x1 , . . . , xn )f1 (x1 )\u22c6* * *\u22c6fn (xn )dx1 . . . dxn , (12)\n(\u03a80 , \u03c6f1 \u22c6 * * * \u22c6 \u03c6fn \u03a80 ) =\nwhere W (x1 , . . . , xn ) = (\u03a80 , \u03c6(x1 ) * * * \u03c6(xn )\u03a80 ).\nAccording to [9] expression f1 (x1 ) \u22c6 * * * \u22c6 fn (xn ) is well-defined for S \u03b2 with\n\u03b2 < 12 and belongs to the same space S \u03b2 as fi (xi ).\nLet us recall that the series for the Moyal-type product has the following\nform:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013n\n\u0012\n\u221e\nX\n1 i \u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u2202\ni \u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u2202\nf\n(x)f\n(y)\n=\nf\u22c6 (x, y) \u2261 exp\nf (x) f (y).\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n2\n\u2202x\u03bc \u2202y \u03bd\nn! 2\n\u2202x\u03bc \u2202y \u03bd\nn=0\n(13)\n4\n\n\fHere the expression is written only for two points x and y instead of x1 , . . . , xn\nfor simplicity.\nIn accordance with eq. (12) Wightman functions are generalized functions\ncorresponding to test functions, which belong to S \u03b2 .\nLet us consider the set of functions satisfying the condition\ndn\nfk (x) = 0,\ndxn\n\nif\n\nn > k.\n\n(14)\n\nEvidently these functions belong to S \u03b2 . In accordance with latter condition\nthe expansion (13) contains a finite number of derivatives. Thus corresponding\nWightman functions Wk are tempered distributions.\nNow we can take advantage of using Wk : at any finite number k we have a\nlocal theory, that is a theory with finite maximal speed of interaction spread.\nThus we can assume that just as in the case of space-space NC QFT quantum\nfield operators satisfy local commutativity condition in respect with variables\nsatisfying SO (1, 1) symmetry, that gives us possibility to use the same derivation of Haag's theorem as in the case of space-space NC QFT. Let us point out\nthat maximal speed of interaction spread depends on k and goes to infinity if\nk \u2192 \u221e, as NC QFT is a theory with infinite speed of interaction spread.\nThus we have proved Haag's theorem for the special choice of Wightman\nfunctions. Then we can take the limit k \u2192 \u221e. Let us take into account that\nfunctions fk (x1 , . . . , xn ), satisfying eq. (14), owing to convergence of the set\n(13), go to the limit f (x1 ) \u22c6 * * * \u22c6 f (xn ). So the sequence of functionals Wk\nconverges weakly to some functional W . It is known that Gelfand-Shilov space\nS \u03b2 is complete with respect to weak convergence (see [20], p. 91). Haag's\ntheorem is valid for Wightman functions, coinciding with Wk , therefore it is\nvalid for their limit value W corresponding to k = \u221e. So Haag's theorem has\nbeen extended to general case of time-space noncommutativity.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nWe see that Haag's theorem is valid in any theory with S O(1, 1) symmetry, if\ncorresponding test functions belong to one of the Gelfand-Shilov spaces S \u03b2 with\n\u03b2 < 12 . The important physical example of such a theory is NC QFT.\n\nReferences\n[1] R. F. Streater, A. S. Wightman, PCT, spin and statistics, and all that\n(Benjamin, New York 1964).\n[2] N. N.
