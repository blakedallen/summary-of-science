In this letter the Stringy Uncertainty relations, and corrections\nthereof, are explicitly derived from the New Relativity Principle that treats all dimensions and signatures\non the same footing and which is based on the postulate that the Planck scale is the minimal length in\nNature in the same vein that the speed of light was taken as the maximum velocity in Einstein's theory of\nSpecial Relativity. The Regge behaviour of the string's spectrum is also a natural consequence of this New\nRelativity Principle.\nRecently we have proposed that a New Relativity principle may be operating in Nature which could\nreveal important clues to find the origins of M theory [1]. We were forced to introduce this new Relativity\nprinciple, where all dimensions and signatures of spacetime are on the same footing, to find a fully covariant\nformulation of the p-brane Quantum Mechanical Loop Wave equations. This New Relativity Principle, or\nthe principle of Polydimensional Covariance as has been called by Pezzaglia, has also been crucial in the\nderivation of Papapetrou's equations of motion of a spinning particle in curved spaces that was a long\nstanding problem which lasted almost 50 years [2]. A Clifford calculus was used where all the equations\nwere written in terms of Clifford-valued multivector quantities; i.e one had to abandon the use of vectors\nand tensors and replace them by Clifford-algebra valued quantities, matrices, for example .\nIn this letter we will explicitly derive the String Uncertainty Relations, and corrections thereof, directly\nfrom the Quantum Mechanical Wave equations on Noncommutative Clifford manifolds or C-spaces [1].\nThere was a one-to-one correspondence between the nested hierarchy of point, loop, 2-loop, 3-loop,......ploop histories encoded in terms of hypermatrices and wave equations written in terms of Clifford-algebra\nvalued multivector quantities. This permits us to recast the QM wave equations associated with the hierarchy\nof nested p-loop histories, embedded in a target spacetime of D dimensions , where the values of p range from\n: p = 0, 1, 2, 3......D \u2212 1, as a single QM line functional wave equation whose lines live in a Noncommutative\nClifford manifold of 2D dimensions. p = D \u2212 1 is the the maximum value of p that saturates the embedding\nspacetime dimension.\nThe line functional wave equation in the Clifford manifold, C-space is :\nZ\n\u03b42\n+ E 2 )\u03a8[X(\u03a3)] = 0.\n(1)\nd\u03a3 (\n\u03b4X(\u03a3)\u03b4X(\u03a3)\nwhere \u03a3 is an invariant evolution parameter of lD dimensions generalizing the notion of the invariant proper\ntime in Special Relativity linked to a massive point particle line ( path ) history :\n(d\u03a3)2 = (d\u03a9p+1 )2 + \u039b2p (dx\u03bc dx\u03bc ) + \u039b2(p\u22121) (d\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd d\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd ) + \u039b2(p\u22122) (d\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 d\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 ) + .......\n\n(2)\n\n\u039b is the Planck scale in D dimensions. X(\u03a3) is a Clifford-algebra valued \" line \" living in the Clifford\nmanifold ( C-space) :\nX = \u03a9p+1 + \u039bp x\u03bc \u03b3 \u03bc + \u039bp\u22121 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 \u03bd + \u039bp\u22122 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 \u03bd \u03b3 \u03c1 + .........\n\n(3a)\n\nThe multivector X encodes in one single stroke the point history represented by the ordinary x\u03bc coordinates and the holographic projections of the nested family of 1-loop, 2-loop, 3-loop...p-loop histories onto\nthe embedding coordinate spacetime planes given respectively by :\n\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd , \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 ......\u03c3\u03bc1 \u03bc2 ...\u03bcp+1\n1\n\n(3b)\n\n\fThe scalar \u03a9p+1 is the invariant proper p + 1 = D-volume associated with the motion of the ( maximal\ndimension ) p-loop across the D = p + 1-dim target spacetime. There was a coincidence condition [1] that\nrequired to equate the values of the center of mass coordinates x\u03bc , for all the p -loops, with the values of\nthe x\u03bc coordinates of the point particle path history. This was due to the fact that upon setting \u039b = 0 all\nthe p-loop histories collapse to a point history. The latter history is the baseline where one constructs the\nwhole hierarchy. This also required a proportionality relationship :\n\u03c4\u223c\n\nA\n\u03a9p+1\nV\n.\n\u223c 2 \u223c ....... \u223c\n\u039b\n\u039b\n\u039bp\n\n(4)\n\n\u03c4, A, V....\u03a9p+1 represent the invariant proper time, proper area, proper volume,... proper p + 1-dim volume\nswept by the point, loop, 2-loop, 3-loop,..... p-loop histories across their motion through the embedding\nspacetime, respectively. E = T is a quantity of dimension (mass)p+1 , the maximal p-brane tension (\np = D \u2212 1) .\nThe wave functional \u03a8 is in general a Clifford-valued, hypercomplex number. In particular it could be\na complex, quaternionic or octonionic valued quantity. At the moment we shall not dwell on the very subtle\ncomplications and battles associated with the quaternionic/octonionic extensions of Quantum Mechanics [14]\nbased on Division algebras and simply take the wave function to be a complex number. The line functional\nwave equation for lines living in the Clifford manifold ( C-spaces) are difficult to solve in general. To obtain\nthe String Uncertainty Relations, and corrections thereof, one needs to simplify them. The most simple\nexpression is to write the simplified wave equation in units h\u0304 = c = 1 :\n[\u2212(\n\n\u22022\n\u2202x\u03bc \u2202x\u03bc\n\n+\n\n\u22022\n\u22022\n\u039b2\n\u039b4\n+\n+ ......) \u2212 \u039b2p E 2 ] \u03a8[x\u03bc , \u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd , \u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 , .....] = 0\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n2 \u2202\u03c3 \u2202\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd\n3! \u2202\u03c3 \u2202\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n\n(5)\n\nwhere we have dropped the first component of the Clifford multivector dependence, \u03a9p+1 , of the wave\nfunctional \u03a8 and we have replaced functional differential equations for ordinary differential equations. Had\none kept the first component dependence \u03a9p+1 on \u03a8 one would have had a cosmological constant contribution\nto the E term as we will see below. Similar types of equations in a different context with only the first two\nterms of eq-(5), have also been written in [2].\nThe last equation contains the seeds of the String Uncertainty Relations and corrections thereof. Plane\nwave type solutions to eq-(5) are :\n\u03a8 = ei(k\u03bc x\n\n\u03bc\n\n+k\u03bc\u03bd \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd +k\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 +.......)\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nwhere k\u03bc\u03bd , k\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 ..... are the area-momentum, volume-momentum,..... p + 1-volume-momentum conjugate\nvariables to the holographic \u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd , \u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 ... coordinates respectively. These are the components of the Cliffordalgebra valued multivector K that admits an expansion into a family of antisymmetric tensors of arbitrary\nrank like the Clifford-algebra valued \"line\" X did earlier in eq-(3a). The multivector K is nothing but the\nconjugate polymomentum variable to X in C-space. Inserting the plane wave solution into the simplified\nwave equation yields the generalized dispersion relation, after reinserting the suitable powers of h\u0304 :\n1\n\u039b2p E 2\n1\nh\u03042 (k 2 + \u039b2 (k\u03bc\u03bd )(k \u03bc\u03bd ) + \u039b4 (k\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 )(k \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 ) + ........) \u2212\n= 0.\n2\n3!\nh\u03042p\nthis is just the generalization of the ordinary wave/particle dispersion relationship\np2 = h\u03042 k 2 . p2 \u2212 m2 = 0.\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nHad one included the \u03a9p+1 dependence on \u03a8; i.e an extra piece exp [i\u03a9p+1 \u03bb], where \u03bb is the cosmological\nconstant of dimensions (mass)(p+1) . The required \u2212\u039b2p \u2202 2 \u03a8/(\u2202\u03a9p+1 )2 term of the simplified wave equation\n(5) would have generated an extra term of the form \u039b2p \u03bb2 . After reinserting the suitable powers of h\u0304, the\ncosmological constant term will precisely shif t the value of the \u2212\u039b2p E 2 /h\u03042p piece of eq-(7) to the value :\n2p\n2\n2\n2\n\u2212( \u039b\nh\u0304 ) (E \u2212 \u03bb ), which precisely has an overall dimension of m as expected.\nHence, this will be then the \" vacuum \" contribution to maximal p-brane tension ( p = D \u2212 1) : E = Tp\nhas overall units (mass)p+1 ; i.e energy per p-dimensional volume. On dimensional grounds and due to the\ncoincidence condition [1] referred above one has that :\n2\n\n\f(k\u03bc\u03bd )(k \u03bc\u03bd ) \u223c (k 2 )2 = k 4 . (k\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 )(k \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 ) \u223c (k 3 )2 = k 6 ......\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the proportionality factors in eq-(9) are scalar-valued quantities that we choose to be ( for simplicity\n) the dimension-dependent constants, \u03b21 , \u03b22 .... respectively. The coincidence condition implies that upon\nsetting \u039b = 0 all the p-loop histories collapse to a point history. In that case the areas, volumes, ...hypervolumes collapse to zero and the wave equation (5) reduces to the ordinary Klein-Gordon equation for a spin\nzero massive particle.\nFactoring out the k 2 factor in (7), using the analog of the dispersion relation (8) and taking the square\nroot, after performing the binomial/Taylor expansion of the square root, subject to the condition \u039b2 k 2 << 1,\none obtains an ef f ective energy dependent Planck \" constant \" that takes into account the Noncommutative\nnature of the Clifford manifold (C-space ) at Planck scales :\nh\u0304ef f (k 2 ) = h\u0304(1 +\n\n1\n1\n\u03b21 \u039b 2 k 2 +\n\u03b22 \u039b4 k 4 + ...................).\n2.2!\n2.3!\n\n(10)\n\nwhere we have included explicitly the D dependent coefficients \u03b21 , \u03b22 , ... that arise in (9) due to the\ncoincidence condition and on dimensional analysis.\nArguments concerning an effective value of Planck's \" constant \" related to higher derivative theories\nand the modified uncertainty relations have been given by [8]. The advantage of this derivation based on the\nNew Relativity Principle is that one automatically avoids the problems involving the ad hoc introduction of\nhigher derivatives in Physics ( ghosts, ...) .\nThe uncertainty relations for the coordinates-momenta follow from the Heisenberg-Weyl algebraic relation familiar in QM :\n\u2206x\u2206p \u2265 | < [x\u0302, p\u0302] > |. [x\u0302, p\u0302] = ih\u0304\n\n(11)\n\nNow we have that in C-spaces, x, p must not, and should not, be interpreted as ordinary vectors of spacetime\nbut as one of the many components of the Clifford-algebra valued multivectors that \" coordinatize \" the\nNoncommutative Clifford Manifold, C-space. The Noncommutativity is encoded in the ef f ective value of\nthe Planck's \" constant \" which modif ies the Heisenberg-Weyl x, p algebraic commutation relations and,\nconsequently, generates new uncertainty relations :\n\u2206x\u2206p \u2265 | < [x\u0302, p\u0302] > | =< h\u0304ef f >= h\u0304(1 +\n\n1\n1\n\u03b21 \u039b 2 < k 2 > +\n\u03b22 \u039b4 < k 4 > +.......)\n2.2!\n2.3!\n\n(12)\n\nUsing the relations :\nh\u0304k = p.\n\n< p2 >\u2265 (\u2206p)2 .\n\n< p4 >\u2265 (\u2206p)4 .....\n\n(13)\n\none arrives at :\n\u2206x\u2206p \u2265 h\u0304 +\n\n\u03b21 \u039b 2\n\u03b22 \u039b 4\n(\u2206p)4 + .......\n(\u2206p)2 +\n4h\u0304\n12h\u03043\n\n(14)\n\nFinally, keeping the first two terms in the expansion in the r.h.s of eq- (14) one recovers the ordinary\nString Uncertainty Relation [5] directly from the New Relativity Principle as promised :\n\u2206x \u2265\n\nh\u0304\n\u03b21 \u039b 2\n+\n(\u2206p).\n\u2206p\n4h\u0304\n\n(15)\n\nwhich is just a reflection of the minimum distance condition in Nature [3,4,5,6,7,10] and an inherent Noncommutative nature of the Clifford manifold ( C-space ). Eq-(15) yields a minimum value of \u2206x of the\norder of the Planck length \u039b that can be verified explicitly simply by minimizing eq-(15).\nThere is a widespread misunderstanding about the modification of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra (12).\nOne could start from a canonical pair of variables q, p and perform a noncanonical change of variables Q, P\nsuch as to precisely reproduce the modified commutation relations of eq-(12) :\n3\n\n\fx \u2192 x\u2032 = x. p \u2192 p\u2032 . [x\u2032 , p\u2032 ] = ih\u0304[\n\n\u2202p\u2032\ni\u03b21 \u039b2 \u2032 2\n\u2202 \u2032\n, p ] = ih\u0304\n= ih\u0304 +\n(p ) + ....\n\u2202p\n\u2202p\n4h\u0304\n\nIntegrating (16a) keeping only the leading terms yields the desired relationship between p and p\u2032 :\nZ\ndp\u2032\n.\np(p\u2032 ) =\n2\n1\u039b\n\u2032 2\n1 + \u03b24h\u0304\n2 (p )\n\n(16a)\n\n(16b)\n\nThis noncanonical change of coordinates is not what is represented here by the modified HeisenbergWeyl algebra. Space at small scales is not necessarily governed by the familiar Lorentzian symmetries : it is\na Noncommutative Clifford manifold that requires abandoning the naive notion of vectors and tensors and\nreplacing them by Clifford multivectors. Inotherwords, it is a world where Quantum Groups operate . The\nfact that the String Uncertainty relations reflect the existence of a minimum length in Nature is consistent\nwith the discretization of spacetime at the Planck scale [9] and the replacement of ordinary Lorentzian\ngroup symmetries by Quantum Group ( Hopf Algebras) Symmetries [12].\nThe New Relativity Principle reshuffles, for example, a loop history into a membrane history; a membrane history into a into a 5-brane history; a 5-brane history into a 9-brane history and so forth; in particular\nit can transform a p-brane history into suitable combinations of other p-brane histories as building blocks.\nThis is the bootstrap idea taken from the point particle case to to the p-branes case : each brane is made out\nof all the others. \" Lorentz\" transformations in C-spaces involve hypermatrix changes of \" coordinates \" [1]\n. The naive Lorentz transformations do not apply in the world of Planck scale physics. Only at large scales\nthe Riemannian continuum is recaptured . For a discussion of the more fundamental Finsler Geometries\nimplementing the minimum scale ( maximal proper acceleration ) in String Theory see [13].\nThe New Relativity principle not only reproduces the ordinary String Uncertainty Relations but yields\ncorrections thereof in one single stroke as we have shown in eq-(14)! This is a positive sign that the New\nRelativity principle is on the right track to reveal the geometrical foundations of M theory . Uncertainty\nrelations based on the Scale Relativity theory [3] were furnished in [10]. We must emphasize that the latter\nuncertainty relations involved spacetime resolutions. Resolutions are not statistical uncertainties, therefore\nthe relations [10] cannot be used to evaluate the modified coordinates-momenta commutation relations like\nthe r.h.s of (12).\nTo finalize this letter we will show how the Regge trajectories behaviour of the string's spectrum emerges\nalso from the New Relativity principle. Pezzaglia's derivation of Papapetrou's equations [2] for a spinning\nparticle moving in curved spaces were based on an invariant interval of the form :\n(d\u03a3)2 = dx\u03bc dx\u03bc +\n\n1\nd\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd d\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd .\n2\u03bb2\n\n(17a)\n\nwhere \u03bb is a length scale. The norm of the Clifford-valued momentum is :\nP 2 = p\u03bc p\u03bc +\n\n1\nS\u03bc\u03bd S \u03bc\u03bd .\n2\u03bb2\n\n(17b)\n\nwhere S \u03bc\u03bd is the spin or canonically-conjugate variable to the area . If we set the \u03bb \u223c \u039b and relate the\nsquared-norm ||S \u03bc\u03bd ||2 to the value of the norm-squared of the 2-vector conjugate to the holographic area\nvariables \u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd ; i.e (k \u03bc\u03bd )(k\u03bc\u03bd ), norm-squared which is proportional to k 4 , one can infer, after inserting the\nappropriate units ( c = 1), from the spin-squared terms of eq-(17b) and the dispersion relation given by\neq-(7) :\n\u039b 2 m2\n\u039b2 m2P\n||S \u03bc\u03bd ||\n\u039b 2 p2\n=\n= n(\n) = n.\n\u223c \u039b2 k 2 =\n2\n2\nh\u0304\nh\u0304\nh\u0304\nh\u03042\n\n(18)\n\nhence one has that the spin is quantized in units of h\u0304 and from the third term in the r.h.s of eq-(18) one\nrecovers the Regge trajectories behaviour of the string spectrum in units where h\u0304 = c = 1 :\nJ \u223c \u03b1\u2032 m2 + a. m2 \u223c nm2P . \u03b1\u2032 \u223c \u039b2 =\n4\n\n1\n.\nm2P\n\n(19)\n\n\fwhich is consistent with the action-angle variables/ area-quantization A = n\u039b2 ( in units of h\u0304 = c = 1) :\nZ\n\u039b2\nS = P\u03bc\u03bd d\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd \u223c T A \u223c T (n\u039b2 ) \u223c n\n\u223c n.\n(20)\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\nwhere P\u03bc\u03bd is the area-momentum variable conjugate to the string areal interval d\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd . It is the string analog\nof the ordinary momentum p = mv for\nH a point particle. The action is a multiple of h\u0304 as the Bohr-Sommerfield\naction-angle relation indicates : S = pdg = nh\u0304. The area quantization condition, as well as the BekensteinHawking entropy-area relation, have also been obtained\nP pby Loop Quantum Gravity methods [9]. Using Loop\nji (ji + 1) where one is summing over spin quantun\nQuantum Gravity methods they arrive at A \u223c \u039b2\nnumbers along the edges of a spin network. The New Relativity principle is telling us from eqs-(18,19,20)\nthat A = n\u039b2 where n is the spin quantum number !\nHaving derived the string uncertainty relations, and corrections thereof, and explained in simple terms\nwhy there is a link between the Regge trajectories behaviour of the string spectrum with the quantization\nof area, should be enough encouragement to proceed forward with the New Relativity Principle.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Luis and Sheila Perelman for their hospitality in New York City where this work was completed, and for the use of their computer facilities.
