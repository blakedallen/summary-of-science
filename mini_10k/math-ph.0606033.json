An application to the\ntheory of discrete harmonic mappings is also briefly discussed.\n\nMSC classification (2000): 58H05; 65P10; 70S10\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOver the past decades, the interest in discrete mechanics has been steadily increasing.\nPartly this is due to the development of geometric integrators, which provide a relatively\nsimple means for the long-term numerical integration of mechanical systems. On the\nother hand, many concepts (Poisson tensors, reduction, etc.) from the continuum theory\nalso have a natural counterpart in the discrete realm, which makes discrete mechanics a\nsubject worthy of interest in its own right. We refer here in particular to the pioneering\nefforts of Moser and Veselov [17], who studied a class of discrete integrable systems,\nand Weinstein [21], who was the first to recognize the fact that many of these discrete\nsystems can be understood from the point of view of Lie groupoids.\nInspired by these powerful and elegant methods, a number of people set out to develop\na similar geometric approach to classical field theories. Bridges [3] introduced a concept\nof \"multisymplecticity\" for Hamiltonian partial differential equations and later Bridges\n& Reich [4] studied numerical integrators that conserve a discretized version of multisymplecticity. Independently, Marsden, Patrick, and Shkoller [16] extended the work\nof Veselov in order to deal with Lagrangian field theories. In a previous paper [20], we\nbuilt upon their work by extending the Lie-groupoid methods from Weinstein's paper\nand related work by Marrero, Mart\u0131\u0301n, and Mart\u0131\u0301nez [14] to the case of Lagrangian field\ntheories, allowing us to treat a larger class of field theories, as well as shedding new\nlight on some of the constructions in [16].\nIn this note, we now focus on a special class of discrete Lagrangian field theories and\ntheir behaviour in the presence of symmetry: we introduce a reduction procedure,\nsimilar to the one proposed by Marsden, Pekarsky, and Shkoller [15] and Bobenko and\nSuris [1, 2] for discrete mechanical systems, and show that the resulting discrete field\nequations have a simple and natural interpretation in the context of discrete geometry.\nWe begin by introducing a fixed mesh (a certain collection of vertices, edges, and faces)\nin the space of independent variables. Initially, we are interested in discrete fields\nthat associate to each vertex an element of a given Lie group G. If the Lagrangian\nof such a model is G-invariant, we show in \u00a73 that these fields can be reduced to a\nnew class of fields that associate a group element to each edge of the given mesh. This\nreduction procedure is a field-theoretic version of the discrete Euler-Poincar\u00e9 equations\nfrom [15]. We then show that the converse procedure (of reconstruction) is possible\nonly if a certain obstruction vanishes. This obstruction has a natural interpretation as\nthe curvature of a discrete G-connection. This is similar to the case of continuum field\ntheories, as studied in [5, 6].\nIn \u00a74, we take an alternative route to the Euler-Poincar\u00e9 equations: inspired by a\nsimilar treatment in [5], we prove a discrete version of Noether's theorem and use the\nG-invariance of the Lagrangian to derive the field equations. Finally, in \u00a75, we consider\nthe Lagrangian of harmonic mappings into a Lie group: we propose an extension of the\nwell-known Moser-Veselov algorithm, demonstrate its equivalence to the Euler-Poincar\u00e9\n2\n\n\fequations, and establish a particularly clear form of the field equations (involving the\nconcepts of discrete geometry introduced in \u00a72).\nThroughout the paper, a number of simplifying assumptions will be made. In \u00a76 we\ntherefore conclude this paper by giving a brief overview of how these assumptions may\nbe circumvented, and we also indicate how the discrete field theories in this paper fit\ninto the framework of Lie groupoid field theories developed in [20]. In particular, we\nshow that the Euler-Poincar\u00e9 reduction procedure in \u00a73 is just a particular instance of\na general reduction theorem in the category of Lie groupoid field theories.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nDiscrete differential geometry\nDiscretizing the base space\n\nIn this paper, we consider field theories with two independent variables. Such field\ntheories can be modeled as sections of a fibre bundle with base space R2 (see [16]).\nIn order to discretize these fields, we introduce the set of vertices V in R2 as the\nset of points in R2 with integer coordinates (V = Z \u00d7 Z). As in finite-difference\napproximations, the idea is that continuous fields are approximated by specifying their\nvalues on the elements of V .\nFor future reference, we also introduce the set of edges E, whose elements are ordered\npairs of the following form: for all i, j \u2208 Z \u00d7 Z,\n((i, j), (i + 1, j)) \u2208 E,\n\nand ((i, j), (i, j + 1)) \u2208 E.\n\nFurthermore, we also demand that if (x0 , x1 ) \u2208 E, then also (x1 , x0 ) \u2208 E, and we\nwrite (x1 , x0 ) = (x0 , x1 )\u22121 . In other words, E consists of \"horizontal\" and \"vertical\"\nline segments of unit length. To avoid cumbersome notation, we will note an arbitrary\nelement of E as e, or if we have to refer to its begin and end vertex, as (x0 , x1 ).\nFinally, we introduce the set of faces F as the set of quadruples (e0 , e1 , e2 , e3 ) of closed\npaths in E, i.e. where the end vertex of ei is the begin vertex of ei+1 for i = 0, . . . , 3,\nand, in addition, we demand that ei 6= e\u22121\ni+1 for i = 0, . . . , 3. (The indices should be\ninterpreted as being \"modulo 4\": e4 is just e0 .)\nThe elements of F can thus be pictured as little squares in R2 . A generic element\nof F will be noted as f, or, since f is fully determined by its bounding vertices, as\n(x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 ). Note that there are two distinct classes of elements in F : those where\nthe vertices are denoted in clockwise and anticlockwise fashion, respectively.\n\n2.2\n\nDiscrete differential forms\n\nThis section is devoted to a review of some elementary concepts of algebraic topology,\nwhich will be needed in our discussion of discrete harmonic maps in section 5. Most of\n3\n\n\fthis section is modeled on [8], as well as on the text book [9].\nConsider the mesh (V, E) in R2 introduced in the previous section. The collection of\nsets {V, E, F } together with its various incidence relations determines a cell complex\nand this leads us naturally to the concepts of homology and cohomology. It is therefore\nnot unreasonable to expect that some of these concepts will enter our study of discrete\nfield theories later on.\nAn n-chain on the given mesh, where n = 0, 1, 2, is a formal linear combination (with\ncoefficients in R) of \"n-dimensional elements\". More precisely, the vector space of\n0-chains is given by\nC0 = {\u03b11 x1 + * * * + \u03b1m xm : \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1m \u2208 R, x1 , . . . , xm \u2208 V },\n\n(1)\n\nwhere it should be stressed that the elements of C0 are formal linear combinations of\nelements of V . Similarly, the vector space C1 of 1-chains is generated by elements of\nE, C2 by elements of F , and so on. Furthermore, for the space of 1-chains, we adopt\nthe identification that \u2212(x0 , x1 ) = (x1 , x0 ).\nIt is customary to define discrete n-forms as n-dimensional cochains, i.e. elements of\nthe dual vector space Cn\u2217 of Cn . From this definition, it follows immediately that a\ndiscrete zero-form induces a function \u03c6 : V \u2192 R. Conversely, such a function gives rise\nto a zero-form through linear extension.\nSimilarly, discrete one-forms can be identified with functions \u03c6 defined on the set of\nedges. It should be borne in mind that these functions are not necessarily defined on\nthe whole of V \u00d7 V , but only on the subset E of edges of the mesh. We also note that\n\u03c6(x0 , x1 ) = \u2212\u03c6(x1 , x0 ) for any edge (x0 , x1 ).\nWe continue by defining discrete two-forms as functions \u03c8(x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 ) on the set of\nfaces. Again, these functions can be extended unambiguously by linearity to a proper\ncochain. To summarize, we have the following definition:\nDefinition 2.1. For n = 0, 1, 2, a discrete n-form is a linear map f : Cn \u2192 R. For\nn > 2, all discrete n-forms are zero. The set of all discrete n-forms is denoted by Cn\u2217 .\nFor the sake of self-containedness, we recall the explicit form of the coboundary operator\n\u2217\nd : Cn\u2217 \u2192 Cn+1\n. For a zero-form \u03c6, d\u03c6(x0 , x1 ) = \u03c6(x1 ) \u2212 \u03c6(x0 ). For a one-form \u03c6,\nd\u03c6(f) = \u03c6(x0 , x1 ) + \u03c6(x1 , x2 ) + \u03c6(x2 , x3 ) + \u03c6(x3 , x0 ) for all f = (x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 ). (2)\nThe coboundary of a discrete two-form is defined to be zero. We will sometimes refer\nto d as the \"discrete differential\". Note that d is the dual of the boundary operator\n\u2202 : Cn+1 \u2192 Cn , in the sense that hdf, vi = hf, \u2202vi for all f \u2208 Cn\u2217 and v \u2208 Cn , and\nwhere h*, *i is the natural pairing between Cn and Cn\u2217 . This is a discrete analogue of the\nStokes theorem. For more information, see [9, p. 186].\n\n4\n\n\f1\n0\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\nFigure 1: Square mesh (black) and its dual (light).\n\n2.3\n\nThe discrete Hodge star\n\nIn Riemannian geometry, the Hodge star on an oriented manifold M maps n-forms\non M to (m \u2212 n)-forms on M, where m = dim M. As could be expected from the\ncontinuous theory, the discrete Hodge star \u22c6, to be introduced below, maps discrete\nn-forms into (2 \u2212 n)-forms. However, there is an additional complication in the discrete\ncase: the forms \u22c6f are not defined on the mesh itself, but rather on a dual mesh, which\nwe now define.\nThe dual mesh (V \u2217 , E \u2217 ) is constructed as follows. For every face in F , there is a\nvertex in V \u2217 (for which one usually takes the circumcentric dual; see [8]). There is an\nedge in E \u2217 between two vertices q0 , q1 \u2208 V \u2217 if and only if the faces in F corresponding\nto q0 and q1 have precisely one edge in common. This determines the sets V \u2217 and E \u2217 ;\nthe set F \u2217 consists of the faces of this dual graph. It is easy to see that to each face in\nF \u2217 , there corresponds a vertex in V . See figure 1 for an illustration.\nImplicit in this definition is the existence of a duality operator \u2217 between n-chains on\nthe mesh and (2 \u2212 n)-chains on the dual mesh. This duality is well defined, but only\nup to orientation; we now use the standard orientation of R2 to settle this point. The\ndefinition used here agrees with the algorithm for the orientation of dual cells proposed\nin [10, remark 2.5.1].\nWe first define \u2217 on the elements of V , E, and F . By linear extension, it will then\nbe determined on the whole of Cn . The dual vertex \u2217f of a face f whose vertices are\nwritten down in anticlockwise fashion is the element r of V \u2217 introduced above. If, on\nthe other hand, the orientation of f is the opposite, then \u2217f equals \u2212r. We define the\ndual \u2217x of a vertex x to be the corresponding face in F \u2217 , with the natural orientation:\n\u2217x = (r1 , . . . , r4 ). Finally, the definition of \u2217 on E is slightly more intricate; here, we\nfollow [10]. Let (x0 , x1 ) be an edge in E and let {r0 , r1 } be the corresponding dual\nedge, considered as an unordered set. The line segments [x0 , x1 ] and [r0 , r1 ] determine\na basis of R2 : if this basis is positively oriented, then \u2217(x0 , x1 ) = (r0 , r1 ), otherwise,\n\u2217(x0 , x1 ) = (r1 , r0 ). In the case of the square mesh of figure 1, the action of \u2217 on E\ncorresponds to an anticlockwise rotation over \u03c0/2.\nOn the dual mesh, one can again introduce discrete forms. We will denote the vector\nspace of discrete n-forms on the dual mesh by Dn\u2217 . As the dual mesh is again a square\n5\n\n\fmesh, there is a natural way to extend \u2217 to an operator from (V \u2217 , E \u2217 ) to (V, E). It is\nthen easy to check that \u2217 \u2217 v = (\u22121)n(2\u2212n) v for any v \u2208 Cn .\n\u2217\nDefinition 2.2. The discrete Hodge star \u22c6 : Cn\u2217 \u2192 D2\u2212n\nis defined by\n\n(\u22c6\u03b1)(\u2217v) = \u03b1(v) for all v \u2208 Cn .\nThe definition given here is (up to a constant) a special case of the one proposed in [8].\nNote that \u22c6 \u22c6 \u03b1 = (\u22121)n(2\u2212n) \u03b1.\nWith the discrete Hodge star and the coboundary operator of the previous paragraph,\nwe now arrive at the definition of the discrete codifferential.\nDefinition 2.3. Let \u03b1 be a discrete n-form. Then the discrete codifferential \u03b4\u03b1 is\nthe discrete (n \u2212 1)-form \u03b4\u03b1 defined as \u03b4\u03b1 = \u22c6 d \u22c6 \u03b1.\nIt is useful to write out this definition explicitly for one-forms and two-forms. If \u03c6 is a\ndiscrete one-form, then \u03b4\u03c6 is given by\n(\u03b4\u03c6)(x) = \u03c6(x1 , x) + \u03c6(x2 , x) + \u03c6(x3 , x) + \u03c6(x4 , x),\nwhere x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 are the end points of the edges that emanate from x. In other words,\n\u03b4\u03c6 assigns to each vertex x the sum of contributions from \u03c6 on the edges that have x as\na vertex. Secondly, for a discrete two-form \u03c8 we note that \u03b4\u03c8 is the discrete one-form\ngiven by \u03b4\u03c8(x0 , x1 ) = \u03c8(f0 ) \u2212 \u03c8(f1 ), where f0 and f1 are the faces that have (x0 , x1 ) as\na common edge, and where f0 is the face where the orientation of the boundary edges\nagrees with the ordering of (x0 , x1 ), whereas f1 is the face with the opposite ordering.\nRemark 2.4. Our definition of discrete codifferential agrees with the one from Desbrun\net al. [8] up to sign. In their paper, the discrete codifferential is defined as \u03b4\u03b1 =\n(\u22121)kn+1 \u22c6 d \u22c6 \u03b1, where k is the dimension of the ambient space. Note that here, as\nk = 2, (\u22121)kn+1 = \u22121 regardless of n.\n\u22c4\n\n2.4\n\nDiscrete connections\n\nIn the preceding sections, we introduced discrete one-forms as assignments of a real\nnumber to each edge e \u2208 E. This theory can be extended in a straightforward way to\ndiscrete forms taking values in an arbitrary Abelian Lie group G, the only significant\ndifference being that we have to redefine the spaces of n-chains Cn as consisting of\nformal linear combinations with coefficients in Z.\nFor instance, if \u03c6 : C1 \u2192 G is a discrete one-form, then d\u03c6 is determined by its action\non the set F by (2) and can be extended by linearity to yield a map from C2 to G, where\nit should be borne in mind that the elements of C2 are still formal linear combinations\nof elements in F , but now with coefficients in Z.\n6\n\n\fThe theory of discrete forms with values in an Abelian Lie group will be used in section 5,\nbut in the general case, we will be confronted with mappings from E to a non-Abelian\nLie group G. Such maps can no longer be interpreted as discrete one-forms. Luckily,\nit turns out that these maps have a natural interpretation as discrete G-connections,\nwhich we now define.\nDefinition 2.5. A discrete G-connection is a map \u03c9 : E \u2192 G, such that, for\nall edges e \u2208 E, \u03c9(e\u22121 ) = \u03c9(e)\u22121. The curvature of such a connection is the map\n\u03a9 : F \u2192 G defined as \u03a9(f) = \u03c9(e1 ) * * * \u03c9(e4 ), where e1 , . . . , e4 are the boundary edges of\nthe face f. A discrete G-connection is said to be flat if \u03a9(f) = e for all f \u2208 F .\nNote that in the case of a non-flat connection, \u03a9(f) depends not only on f, but also\non the exact representation of f as a set of edges e1 , . . . , e4 (any cyclic permutation of\nthis set represents the same face). However, this indeterminacy does not occur for flat\nconnections, the only case that we will consider later on.\nThe theory of discrete G-connections closely mimics the usual theory of connections. As\nan example, we mention the following proposition, from which a number of interesting\nproperties may be deduced.\nProposition 2.6. Consider a discrete G-connection \u03c9 : E \u2192 G. If \u03c9 is flat, then there\nexists a unique mapping \u03c6 : V \u00d7 V \u2192 G such that \u03c6|E = \u03c9.\nThis follows immediately from [20, prop. 7], or can be proved directly as follows.\nWe define a path in E to be a sequence e1 , e2 , . . . , em of edges, such that the end vertex\nof ei is the begin vertex of ei+1 (for i = 1, . . . , m \u2212 1). Let \u03c9 : E \u2192 G be any discrete\nG-connection. In particular, \u03c9 need not be flat. Then, \u03c9 induces a map \u03c9\u0302 from the set\nof paths to G as follows:\n\u03c9\u0302(e1 , e2 , . . . , em ) = \u03c9(e1 )\u03c9(e2) * * * \u03c9(em).\nWe call \u03c9\u0302 the \"discrete holonomy mapping\". Note that if \u03c9 is a flat connection, one\ncan easily prove that \u03c9\u0302 maps closed paths to the unit in G. Furthermore, in the case\nof a flat connection, it can be easily established that simplicially homotopic paths have\nthe same image under \u03c9\u0302. (This is the discrete counterpart of a well-known theorem of\ncontinuous connections (see [11, p. 93]): if \u03c9 is a flat connection, then any two closed\nhomotopic loops have the same holonomy.)\nLet us now return to the discrete theory. In the case of a flat connection on a simplyconnected cell complex, we have seen that \u03c9\u0302 does not depend on the choice of path\nbetween two fixed points, and induces therefore a map \u03c9\u0302 : V \u00d7 V \u2192 G. This map\nsatisfies the requirements in proposition 2.6.\nRemark 2.7. The concept of discrete G-connections used here is common in lattice\ngauge theories (see [22]). Novikov [18] studied a similar concept.\n7\n\n\fClosely related to this definition is the concept of discrete connection on a discrete\nprincipal fibre bundle (see [12] for definitions and [14, \u00a75.4] for an application to discrete\nreduction). The latter could be used to extend the results in this paper to the case of\nLagrange-Poincar\u00e9 reduction, where a G-invariant Lagrangian on a pair groupoid Q\u00d7Q\nis given. If Q coincides with the symmetry group G, then Lagrange-Poincar\u00e9 reduction\nis just Euler-Poincar\u00e9 reduction, the case considered here.\n\u22c4\n\n3\n\nDiscrete Euler-Poincar\u00e9 reduction\n\nIn this section, we begin our study of discrete Lagrangian field theories. Initially, we\ndefine discrete fields as follows:\nDefinition 3.1. A discrete field is a map \u03c6 : V \u2192 G.\nIf the discrete Lagrangian, to be defined below, is G-invariant, we shall see that these\nfields induce a new class of discrete fields, that associate a group element to each edge.\nFrom the last section, we know that such maps have a natural interpretation as discrete\nG-connections.\nIn theorem 3.4, it is shown how the field equations for the unreduced fields \u03c6 are\nequivalent to a set of equations, called discrete Euler-Poincar\u00e9 equations, for the reduced\nfields \u03c6. Both sets of equations arise by extremizing a certain action functional. In\ntheorem 3.6, we deal with the reconstruction problem. Starting from a reduced field\n\u03c6 : E \u2192 G, it is shown that \u03c6 gives rise to a solution \u03c6 : V \u2192 G of the original field\nequations if and only if the curvature of \u03c6 vanishes. This treatment was inspired by the\nwork of Castrill\u00f3n and Ratiu [6], who developed Lagrangian reduction for field theories\nin the continuous case.\n\n3.1\n\nThe discrete Lagrangian\n\nDefinition 3.2. A discrete Lagrangian is a function L : G \u00d7 G \u00d7 G \u2192 R.\nA word of explanation is in order here. In the continuous case, a Lagrangian is a\nfunction L : J 1 \u03c0 \u2192 R, where J 1 \u03c0 is the first jet bundle of the bundle \u03c0 : R2 \u00d7 G \u2192 R2 .\nIt can be shown that, in this case, J 1 \u03c0 is isomorphic to R2 \u00d7 (T G \u2295 T G) (see [19,\nlemma 4.1.20]). Under the (modest) assumption that Lagrangian L does not depend\non the coordinates of the base space, we therefore conclude that L is just a function on\nT G \u2295 T G.\nThe idea of defining a discrete Lagrangian as a function on G \u00d7 G \u00d7 G then follows\nfrom the idea of Moser and Veselov of approximating T G by G \u00d7 G: by applying this\nVeselov-type discretization twice (once in the \"horizontal\" and once in the \"vertical\"\n8\n\n\fh\ng3\nh\nv2\nv1\ng1\n\ng2\n\nFigure 2: Discretization of T G \u2295 T G by G \u00d7 G \u00d7 G\n\ndirection of the square mesh), it follows that T G \u2295 T G has G \u00d7 G \u00d7 G as a natural\ndiscrete counterpart; see figure 2.\nThe Lie group G has a natural diagonal action by left translations on the Cartesian\nproduct G \u00d7 G: g * (g1 , g2 ) = (gg1 , gg2). We now wish to study the situation where L is\ninvariant under this action. As the quotient (G \u00d7 G)/G is naturally isomorphic to the\nLie group G itself, a discrete field \u03c6 : V \u2192 G induces a \"reduced field\" \u03c6 : E \u2192 G as\nfollows:\n\u03c6(e) = \u03c6(x0 )\u22121 \u03c6(x1 ), for all e = (x0 , x1 ) \u2208 E.\nThis leads us to the following definition:\nDefinition 3.3. A reduced discrete field is a map \u03c6 : E \u2192 G such that \u03c6(e\u22121 ) =\n\u03c6(e)\u22121 . Equivalently, it is a discrete G-connection.\nThe reduced field \u03c6 induced by a discrete field \u03c6 : V \u2192 G is flat when considered as a\ndiscrete G-connection. Hence, by proposition 2.6 (or simply by construction), it may\nbe extended to a map \u03c6 : V \u00d7 V \u2192 G. However, not all reduced fields are flat.\nThe Lagrangian L gives rise to a reduced Lagrangian l : G \u00d7 G \u2192 R defined by\nl(g1\u22121g2 , g1\u22121g3 ) = L(g1 , g2, g3 ).\nLet \u03a6 : G \u00d7 G \u2192 G be the map defined as \u03a6(g, g \u2032) = g \u22121g \u2032 , so that the reduced field \u03c6\nassociated to a discrete field \u03c6 is given by\n\u03c6 = \u03a6 \u25e6 (\u03c6 \u00d7 \u03c6).\n\n(3)\n\nFurthermore, we introduce the following mapping:\n\u03a8\u0302 : (g1 , g2 , g3 ) \u2208 G \u00d7 G \u00d7 G 7\u2192 (g1\u22121g2 , g1\u22121 g3 ) \u2208 G \u00d7 G.\n\n(4)\n\nIt is obvious that the Lagrangian L is related to the reduced Lagrangian by L = l \u25e6 \u03a8\u0302.\nFor future reference, we also introduce a map \u03a8\u0304 : T (G3 ) \u2192 (G \u00d7 g)3 as\n\u03a8\u0304(v1 , v2 , v3 ) = (g1 , g2 , g3 ; T Lg1\u22121 (v1 ), T Lg2\u22121 (v2 ), T Lg3\u22121 (v3 )),\nwhere vi \u2208 Tgi G.\n9\n\n(5)\n\n\fAn unreduced field \u03c6 : V \u2192 G can be interpreted as an assignment of an element \u03c6i,j\nin G to each vertex (i, j). Similarly, a reduced field \u03c6 : E \u2192 G can be described as an\nassignment of a group element ui,j to each \"vertical\" edge ((i, j + 1), (i, j)), and of a\ngroup element vi,j to each \"horizontal\" edge ((i, j), (i + 1, j)), where\nui,j = \u03c6\u22121\ni,j \u03c6i+1,j\n\nand vi,j = \u03c6\u22121\ni,j \u03c6i,j+1 .\n\n(6)\n\nWe will use these notations for the remainder of the paper.\n\n3.2\n\nThe reduction problem\n\nGiven a discrete Lagrangian L, the discrete action sum S is given by\nX\nS(\u03c6) =\nL(\u03c6i,j , \u03c6i+1,j , \u03c6i,j+1),\n(i,j)\u2208U\n\nwhere \u03c6 is a map from V to G, and where U is a finite subset of the set of vertices V .\nIn [16], it was shown that \u03c6 is an extremum of this action if and only \u03c6 satisfies the\nfollowing set of discrete Euler-Lagrange equations: for all (i, j) \u2208 V ,\n\u2202L\n\u2202L\n\u2202L\n(\u03c6i,j , \u03c6i+1,j , \u03c6i,j+1) +\n(\u03c6i\u22121,j , \u03c6i,j , \u03c6i\u22121,j+1) +\n(\u03c6i,j\u22121, \u03c6i+1,j\u22121, \u03c6i,j ) = 0. (7)\n\u2202g1\n\u2202g2\n\u2202g3\nSimilarly, we may define the reduced action sum s as\nX\ns(\u03c6) =\nl(ui,j , vi,j ).\n(i,j)\u2208U\n\nA reduced field \u03c6 : E \u2192 G is an extremum of s if and only if it satisfies the discrete\nEuler-Poincar\u00e9 equations, to be derived below. The central aspects of discrete EulerPoincar\u00e9 reduction are summarized in the following theorem. This theorem, as well as\nits proof, are very similar to the discrete reduction process in mechanics (see [15]).\nTheorem 3.4 (Reduction). Let L be a G-invariant Lagrangian on G \u00d7 G \u00d7 G and\nconsider the reduced Lagrangian l on G \u00d7 G. Consider a discrete field \u03c6 : V \u2192 G and\nlet \u03c6 : V \u00d7 V \u2192 G be the induced reduced field. Then the following are equivalent:\n(a) \u03c6 is a solution of the discrete Euler-Lagrange equations for L;\n(b) \u03c6 is an extremum of the action sum S for arbitrary variations;\n(c) the reduced field \u03c6 is a solution of the discrete Euler-Poincar\u00e9 equations:\nh\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011i\n\u2217\n\u2217\nRui,j dl(*, vi,j ) \u2212 Lui\u22121,j dl(*, vi\u22121,j ) +\nh\u0010\n\u0011e \u0010\n\u0011e i\n\u2217\n\u2217\nRvi,j dl(ui,j , *) \u2212 Lvi,j\u22121 dl(ui,j\u22121 , *)\n= 0;\ne\n\ne\n\n10\n\n(8)\n\n\f(d) the reduced field \u03c6 is an extremum of the reduced action sum s for variations of\nthe form\n\u03b4ui,j = T Lui,j (\u03b8i+1,j ) \u2212 T Rui,j (\u03b8i,j ) \u2208 Tui,j G\n(9)\nand\n\u03b4vi,j = T Lvi,j (\u03b8i,j+1) \u2212 T Rvi,j (\u03b8i,j ) \u2208 Tvi,j G,\n\n(10)\n\n(\u03b4\u03c6i,j ) \u2208 g.\nwhere \u03b8i,j = T L\u03c6\u22121\ni,j\nProof. The equivalence of (a) and (b) follows from a standard argument in discrete\nLagrangian field theories, and was shown in [20].\nIn order to prove the equivalence of (b) and (d), we note that L = l \u25e6 \u03a8\u0302 (see (4)), from\nwhich we conclude that if \u03c6 = \u03a6 \u25e6 \u03c6, then S(\u03c6) = s(\u03c6). Now, consider the components\n{ui,j } and {vi,j } of the reduced field, as in (6). It is easy to check that an arbitrary\nvariation \u01eb 7\u2192 \u03c6i,j (\u01eb) of \u03c6 induces corresponding variations \u03b4ui,j and \u03b4vi,j of ui,j and vi,j ,\ngiven by (9) and (10).\nFinally, we show the equivalence of (d) with the Euler-Poincar\u00e9 equations (8). From\nthe reduced action sum s(\u03c6) we obtain that\nd\ns(\u03c6(\u01eb))\nd\u01eb\n\n\u01eb=0\n\nX d\nl(ui,j (\u01eb), vi,j (\u01eb))\n\u01eb=0\nd\u01eb\ni,j\nX\n=\n(dl(*, vi,j ) * \u03b4ui,j + dl(ui,j , *) * \u03b4vi,j ) .\n\n=\n\ni,j\n\nSubstitution of (9) and (10) into this expression then yields (after relabelling some of\nthe summation indices) the discrete Euler-Poincar\u00e9 equations (8).\nIn this context, a variation can be interpreted in two ways. In the case of unreduced\nfields, a variation of a field \u03c6i,j is a map \u03b4\u03c6 : V \u2192 T G such that \u03b4\u03c6i,j \u2208 T\u03c6i,j G. In the\ncase of reduced fields, a variation of a field {ui,j , vi,j } is a pair of maps \u03b4u, \u03b4v : V \u2192 T G\nsuch that \u03b4ui,j \u2208 Tui,j G and \u03b4vi,j \u2208 Tvi,j G. In both cases, we demand that the variation\nis zero on the boundary of U:\n\u03b4\u03c6i,j = 0,\n\nand \u03b4ui,j = \u03b4vi,j = 0 for all (i, j) \u2208 \u2202U.\n\n(11)\n\nHere, the boundary \u2202U is defined as the set of vertices (i, j) such that (i, j) is a vertex\nof at least one face in U, and at least one face not in U (see [16]).\n\n3.3\n\nThe reconstruction problem\n\nFrom theorem 3.4, we know that a solution \u03c6 : V \u2192 G of the discrete Euler-Lagrange\nequations gives rise to a reduced field \u03c6 : E \u2192 G, which has a natural interpretation\nas a flat discrete connection in the sense of definition 2.5.\n11\n\n\fTo tackle the converse problem, we use the following consequence of proposition 2.6.\nRecall that the holonomy mapping \u03c9\u0302 of a flat discrete connection \u03c9 is a map from V \u00d7V\nto G.\nProposition 3.5. Let \u03c9 be a flat discrete G-connection with associated discrete holonomy \u03c9\u0302 : V \u00d7 V \u2192 G. Then there exists a map \u03c6 : V \u2192 G such that \u03c9(x0 , x1 ) =\n\u03c6(x0 )\u22121 \u03c6(x1 ). The map \u03c6 is unique up to left translation by an element of G.\nProof. Choose an arbitrary vertex x0 and a group element g0 , and define \u03c6(x0 ) = g0 .\nLet x1 be any other vertex and put \u03c6(x1 ) = g0 \u03c9\u0302(x0 , x1 ). This map is well defined.\nLet \u03c6 : E \u2192 G be a solution of the discrete Euler-Poincar\u00e9 equations (8). We now wish\nto reconstruct a solution \u03c6 of the original problem, such that \u03c6 = \u03a6 \u25e6 \u03c6. The map \u03c6 is\nprovided by proposition 3.5, on the condition that \u03c6 is a flat connection. As soon as \u03c6\nis not flat, the holonomy \u03c9\u0302 is path dependent, and no such \u03c6 can exist. Therefore, we\nhave the following theorem.\nTheorem 3.6 (reconstruction). Let \u03c6 : E \u2192 G be a solution of the discrete EulerPoincar\u00e9 equations (8). There exists a solution \u03c6 : V \u2192 G of the unreduced EulerLagrange equations (7) if and only if \u03c6 is flat. In that case, \u03c6 is uniquely determined\nup to left translation by an element of G.\nRemark 3.7. In some cases, the element g0 \u2208 G used in constructing the map \u03c6 is\nfixed by considering boundary or initial conditions on the solutions.\n\u22c4\n\n4\n\nThe Noether theorem\n\nIn the case of continuous field theories, Noether's theorem states that, for each continuous symmetry, there exists a conservation law (see [7] for an overview). Here, we will\nshow that a similar theorem holds for discrete field theories with a continuous symmetry, and that the conservation law associated to the left G-invariance of the Lagrangian\nis equivalent to the Euler-Poincar\u00e9 equations. A similar theorem was proved in [5] in\nthe case of Lagrangian reduction for continuous field theories.\n\n4.1\n\nThe Poincar\u00e9-Cartan forms\n\nWe begin by introducing a set of Poincar\u00e9-Cartan forms that will be instrumental in\nformulating the Noether theorem. It should be remarked that the definition of the\nPoincar\u00e9-Cartan forms here is a special case of a more general construction, elaborated\nin [20] and briefly outlined in section 6.\nAs in section 3, let L : G3 = G \u00d7 G \u00d7 G \u2192 R be a G-invariant Lagrangian and consider\nthe reduced Lagrangian l : G2 = G\u00d7G \u2192 R. Associated to L is a set of three one-forms,\n12\n\n\fcalled Poincar\u00e9-Cartan forms, and defined as follows:\nL\n\u03b8(1)\n: G3 \u2192 T \u2217 (G3 ),\n\nL\n\u03b8(1)\n(g1 , g2 , g3 ), (v1 , v2 , v3 ) = hdL(*, g2 , g3 )g1 , v1 i ,\n\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nwith vi \u2208 Tgi G, and similarly for \u03b8(2)\nand \u03b8(3)\n. Note that \u03b8(1)\n+ \u03b8(2)\n+ \u03b8(3)\n= dL.\n\nFor the reduced Lagrangian l, the definition of the Poincar\u00e9-Cartan forms is somewhat\nless direct.

For\na fully symmetric set of Poincar\u00e9-Cartan forms, one should follow the prescriptions of\n[20].\nThe Lagrangian L is related to the reduced Lagrangian l as follows: L = l \u25e6 \u03a8\u0302. A\nstraightforward computation (or the application of theorem 25 in [20]) shows us that\nthe corresponding Poincar\u00e9-Cartan forms are related in a similar way:\nLemma 4.1. Let \u03a8 be the bundle map (\u03a8\u0302, \u03a8\u0304) as defined above. Then\nl\nL\n\u03a8\u22c6 \u03b8(i)\n= \u03b8(i)\n.\nl\nand\nFurthermore, a similar identity holds for the presymplectic forms \u03a9l(i) := \u2212d\u03b8(i)\nL\nL\n\u03a9(i) := \u2212d\u03b8(i) :\n\u03a8\u22c6 \u03a9l(i) = \u03a9L(i) .\nl\nby the bundle map \u03a8 = (\u03a8\u0302, \u03a8\u0304) : T (G)3 \u2192 (G \u00d7 g)3\nWe recall that the pullback of \u03b8(i)\nis defined as follows:\nD\nE\nl\nl\n(\u03a8\u22c6 \u03b8(i)\n)(g1 , g2 , g3 ), (v1 , v2 , v3 ) = \u03b8(i)\n(\u03a8\u0302(g1 , g2 , g3 )), \u03a8\u0304(v1 , v2 , v3 ) .\n\n13\n\n\f\u2217f2\n\n\u2217f1\n\n\u2217f3\n\nFigure 3: Location of f1 , f2 , and f3 .\n\n4.2\n\nThe unreduced Lagrangian\n\nThe Lagrangian L : G3 \u2192 R is assumed to be left G-invariant in the sense that\nL(gg1, gg2 , gg3) = L(g1 , g2 , g3 ) for all g in G. According to Noether's theorem, which\nwe will prove in a moment, there is a conservation law associated to this symmetry.\nLet \u03be be an element of g. Infinitesimal invariance of Lagrangian under the flow generated\nby \u03be is expressed as\nhdL(g1 , g2 , g3 ), (\u03beG (g1 ), \u03beG (g2 ), \u03beG (g3 ))i = 0,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03beG , defined by \u03beG (g) = T Rg (\u03be), is the fundamental vector field associated to \u03be.\nConsider the functions J\u03bei : G3 \u2192 R, i = 1, 2, 3, given by\nL\nJ\u03bei (g1 , g2 , g3 ) = \u03b8(i)\n(g1 , g2 , g3 ), (\u03beG (g1 ), \u03beG (g2 ), \u03beG (g3 )) .\n\nAs J\u03bei is linear in \u03be, we can define a map J i : G3 \u2192 g\u2217 by the prescription hJ i , \u03bei = J\u03bei ,\nfor all \u03be \u2208 g. An immediate consequence of the G-invariance is that\nJ 1 + J 2 + J 3 = 0.\n\n(16)\n\nNow, let there be given a map \u03c6 : V \u2192 G and consider the pull-back of each J i by\n\u03c8 := \u03c6 \u00d7 \u03c6 \u00d7 \u03c6. In this way, we obtain a map from F to g\u2217 , which can be identified, by\nmeans of the discrete Hodge star, with a map from V \u2217 to g\u2217 . In view of (16) it turns\nout that we only need to consider two such maps, which we will denote by \u03b7 (x) and \u03b7 (y) ,\nand which are given by\n\u03b7 (x) (r) = J 2 (\u03c6(x1 ), \u03c6(x2 ), \u03c6(x3 )),\n\nand \u03b7 (y) (r) = J 3 (\u03c6(x1 ), \u03c6(x2 ), \u03c6(x3 ))\n\nfor r \u2208 V \u2217 , and where f = (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) is the face dual to r: \u2217f = r. We further put\n(x)\n(y)\n\u03b7\u03be = \u03b7 (x) , \u03be and \u03b7\u03be = \u03b7 (y) , \u03be .\nBefore stating Noether's theorem, we recall the definition of the backward difference\noperators \u03b4x\u2212 and \u03b4y\u2212 : if r1 , r2 and r3 , with ri = \u2217fi , are located as in figure 3, and\nf : V \u2217 \u2192 R is a function, then\n(\u03b4x\u2212 f )(r1 ) = f (r1 ) \u2212 f (r2 ) and (\u03b4y\u2212 f )(r1 ) = f (r1 ) \u2212 f (r3 ).\n14\n\n\fThese difference operators can be extended without difficulty to the case of vectorvalued functions.\nProposition 4.2 (Noether). Consider a G-invariant Lagrangian L : G3 \u2192 R. If \u03c6 is\na solution of the discrete field equations (7), then the maps \u03b7 (x) , \u03b7 (y) : V \u2217 \u2192 g\u2217 satisfy\nthe following conservation law:\n\u03b4x\u2212 \u03b7 (x) + \u03b4y\u2212 \u03b7 (y) = 0.\n\n(17)\n\nConversely, if \u03c6 is such that the associated mappings \u03b7 (x) and \u03b7 (y) satisfy (17), then \u03c6\nis a solution of the discrete field equations.\nProof. Consider points r1 , r2 , r3 of the dual mesh as in figure 3 and let fi be the dual\nface to ri : fi = \u2217ri . Then we have that\n(x)\n\n(y)\n\n(x)\n\n(x)\n\n(y)\n\n(y)\n\n\u03b4x\u2212 \u03b7\u03be (r1 ) + \u03b4y\u2212 \u03b7\u03be (r1 ) = \u03b7\u03be (r1 ) \u2212 \u03b7\u03be (r2 ) + \u03b7\u03be (r1 ) \u2212 \u03b7\u03be (r3 )\n= J\u03be2 (\u03c8(f1 )) \u2212 J\u03be2 (\u03c8(f2 )) + J\u03be3 (\u03c8(f1 )) \u2212 J\u03be3 (\u03c8(f3 ))\n= \u2212J\u03be1 (\u03c8(f1 )) \u2212 J\u03be2 (\u03c8(f2 )) \u2212 J\u03be3 (\u03c8(f3 )),\n\n(18)\n\nwhere we have used (16). Recalling that \u03c8 is defined as \u03c8(f) = (\u03c6(x1 ), \u03c6(x2 ), \u03c6(x3 )),\nwe note that\n\u001c\n\u001d\n\u2202L\ni\nL\nJ\u03be (\u03c8(f)) = \u03b8(i) (\u03c8(f))(\u03beG , \u03beG , \u03beG ) =\n(\u03c8(f)), \u03beG .\n\u2202gi\n\nTherefore, we can rewrite the conservation law (18) as\n\u001d\n\u001c\n\u2202L\n\u2202L\n\u2202L\n\u2212 (x)\n\u2212 (y)\n(\u03c8(f1 )) +\n(\u03c8(f2 )) +\n(\u03c8(f3)), \u03beG ,\n\u03b4x \u03b7\u03be (r1 ) + \u03b4y \u03b7\u03be (r1 ) = \u2212\n\u2202g1\n\u2202g2\n\u2202g3\n\nwhich vanishes if \u03c6 satisfies the field equations. Conversely, if the left hand side is zero,\nthen \u03c6 is a solution of the field equations.\n\n4.3\n\nThe reduced Lagrangian\n\nNot only is Noether's theorem equivalent to the unreduced discrete field equations,\nit will turn out that it contains the Euler-Poincar\u00e9 equations as well. To show this,\nwe start from the discrete conservation law as expressed by (18). We use the same\nnotational conventions as in the preceding section and write\n\u03a8\u0302(\u03c8(fi )) = (ui , vi ),\n\ni = 1, 2, 3.\n\nFurthermore, we note that (\u03c8(f1 ))1 = (\u03c8(f2 ))2 = (\u03c8(f3 ))3 ; this unique element of G is\ndenoted by g. By rewriting each of the three expressions in (18) in terms of the reduced\nLagrangian l only, we obtain\nJ\u03be1 (\u03c8(f1 )) = \u2212 Ru\u2217 1 dl(*, v1 ), \u03b7 \u2212 Rv\u22171 dl(u1 , *), \u03b7 ,\n15\n\n\fwhere \u03b7 = Adg\u22121 \u03be, as well as\nJ\u03be2 (\u03c8(f2 )) = L\u2217u2 dl(*, v2 ), \u03b7\n\nand J\u03be3 (\u03c8(f3 )) = L\u2217v3 dl(u3 , *), \u03b7 .\n\nPutting all of these expressions together gives the following:\n(x)\n\n(y)\n\n\u03b4x\u2212 \u03b7\u03be (r1 ) + \u03b4y\u2212 \u03b7\u03be (r1 ) =\n\nD\u0002\n\u0003\nRu\u2217 1 dl(*, v1 ) \u2212 L\u2217u2 dl(*, v2 ) +\n\u0002 \u2217\n\u0003 E\nRv1 dl(u1 , *) \u2212 L\u2217v3 dl(u3 , *) , \u03b7 . (19)\n\nAs \u03b7 ranges over the whole of g, we conclude that the conservation law (17) implies the\ndiscrete Euler-Poincar\u00e9 equation (8).\n\n5\n\nExtending the Moser-Veselov approach\n\nIn their seminal paper, Moser and Veselov [17] approached the problem of finding an\nintegrable discretization of the rigid-body equations by embedding the group SO(n)\ninto a linear space, namely gl(n). Somewhat later, Marsden, Pekarsky, and Shkoller\n[15] then developed a general procedure of Lagrangian reduction for discrete mechanical\nsystems, and showed that the Moser-Veselov equations are equivalent to the discrete\nLie-Poisson equations.\nHere, we intend to do the same thing for a fundamental model in field theory: that of\nharmonic mappings from R2 into a Lie group G. We will show that it is possible to\ndevelop a Moser-Veselov type discretization of these field equations, provided that G\nis embedded in a linear space. As could be expected, these discrete field equations are\nequivalent to the Euler-Poincar\u00e9 equations.\nIn the continuous case, the harmonic mapping Lagrangian is given by\nL=\n\n1 \u22121\n1 \u22121\n\u03c6 \u03c6x , \u03c6\u22121 \u03c6x +\n\u03c6 \u03c6y , \u03c6\u22121 \u03c6y ,\n2\n2\n\n(20)\n\nwhere h*, *i is the Killing form on g and where the subscript 'x' and 'y' denote partial\ndifferentiation with respect to that variable. For the sake of clarity, we will only treat\nthe case of harmonic maps that take values in SO(n), embedded in gl(n), in which case\nthe Killing form is just the trace. We stress that the entire theory can be generalized\nto the case of an arbitrary semi-simple group G, embedded in a linear space.\nConsider the rectangular lattice from section 2.1 and denote the lattice spacing by h.\nAs usual, we denote the values of the field \u03c6 on the lattice points by \u03c6i,j . We discretize\nthe reduced partial derivatives \u03c6\u22121 \u03c6x and \u03c6\u22121 \u03c6y by writing them as follows:\n\u03c6\u22121 \u03c6x \u2248\n\n1 T\n1\n\u03c6i+1,j (\u03c6i+1,j \u2212 \u03c6i,j ) and \u03c6\u22121 \u03c6y \u2248 \u03c6Ti,j+1(\u03c6i,j+1 \u2212 \u03c6i,j ),\nh\nh\n16\n\n\fwhere \u03c6Ti,j is the transpose of the matrix \u03c6i,j . Substituting this into (20) yields the\nfollowing discrete Lagrangian (up to an unimportant constant):\nLd = \u2212\n\n1\n1\ntr(\u03c6Ti,j \u03c6i+1,j ) \u2212 2 tr(\u03c6Ti,j \u03c6i,j+1 ).\n2\nh\nh\n\nIn order to ensure that \u03c6i,j \u2208 SO(n), we need to impose the constraint that \u03c6Ti,j \u03c6i,j = I.\nWe are thus led to consider the following action:\n\u0013\nX\u0012\n\u0001\n1\nT\nT\nT\n(21)\nS(\u03c6) =\ntr(\u03c6i,j \u03c6i+1,j ) + tr(\u03c6i,j \u03c6i,j+1) \u2212 tr \u039bi,j (\u03c6i,j \u03c6i,j \u2212 I) ,\n2\ni,j\nwhere we have rescaled the Lagrange multipliers \u039bi,j to get rid of the factor \u22121/h2 .\nNote that \u039bi,j is a symmetric matrix.\n\nThe field equations are obtained by demanding that S be stationary under arbitrary\nvariations; they are given by\n\u03c6i+1,j + \u03c6i\u22121,j + \u03c6i,j+1 + \u03c6i,j\u22121 = \u03c6i,j \u039bi,j .\n\n(22)\n\nWe multiply these equations by \u03c6Ti,j from the right, and use the fact that \u03c6i,j \u039bi,j \u03c6Ti,j is\na symmetric matrix in order to get rid of the Lagrange multipliers:\n\u03c6i+1,j \u03c6Ti,j + \u03c6i,j+1\u03c6Ti,j + \u03c6i\u22121,j \u03c6Ti,j + \u03c6i,j\u22121\u03c6Ti,j =\n\u03c6i,j \u03c6Ti+1,j + \u03c6i,j \u03c6Ti,j+1 + \u03c6i,j \u03c6Ti\u22121,j + \u03c6i,j \u03c6Ti,j\u22121.\nBy introducing the following quantities,\nmi+1,j = \u03c6i+1,j \u03c6Ti,j \u2212 \u03c6i,j \u03c6Ti+1,j\n\nand ni,j+1 = \u03c6i,j+1\u03c6Ti,j \u2212 \u03c6i,j \u03c6Ti,j+1 ,\n\nthe field equations can be rewritten as the following set of conservation laws:\nmi+1,j + ni,j+1 = mi,j + ni,j .\n\n(23)\n\nFinally, let us introduce the discrete momenta Mi,j and Ni,j , defined as\nMi,j = \u03c6Ti\u22121,j mi,j \u03c6i\u22121,j\n\nand Ni,j = \u03c6Ti,j\u22121ni,j \u03c6i,j\u22121.\n\nThe field equations governing the behaviour of these quantities are then easily determined to be, on the one hand\n(\nT\nMi,j = \u03b1i,j \u2212 \u03b1i,j\nwhere \u03b1i,j = ui\u22121,j ;\n(24)\nT\nNi,j = \u03b2i,j \u2212 \u03b2i,j where \u03b2i,j = vi,j\u22121 ,\nas well as, on the other hand, the counterpart of (23):\nT Ni,j .\nMi+1,j + Ni,j+1 = Ad\u03b1Ti,j Mi,j + Ad\u03b2i,j\n\n(25)\n\nThe similarities with the Moser-Veselov equations for the discrete rigid body are obvious\n(compare with equation (4) in [17]).\n17\n\n\fRemark 5.1. It is now straightforward to see the equivalence between the MoserVeselov and the Euler-Poincar\u00e9 equations. Indeed, starting from the reduced Lagrangian l, put\nMi+1,j = Ru\u2217 i,j dl(*, vi,j ) and Ni,j+1 = Rv\u2217i,j dl(ui,j , *),\nwhich can be interpreted as a discrete Legendre transformation [20]. Furthermore, put\n\u03b1i,j = ui\u22121,j and \u03b2i,j = vi,j\u22121. The Euler-Poincar\u00e9 equations (8) then reduce to the\nMoser-Veselov equations derived above.\n\u22c4\n\n5.1\n\nRelation with the Euler-Poincar\u00e9 equations\n\nInstead of deriving the Euler-Poincar\u00e9 equations from the Moser-Veselov equations, we\ncan also start directly from the discrete action sum (21) and proceed as in section 3.\nThe unreduced field equations are given by (22). We now multiply these equations from\nthe left (rather than from the right as in the derivation of the Moser-Veselov equations)\nto obtain the following set of discrete Euler-Poincar\u00e9 equations:\nT\nui,j + vi,j + uTi\u22121,j + vi,j\u22121\n= \u039bi,j ,\n\n(26)\n\ntogether with the integrability condition\n\u22121\nui,j vi+1,j u\u22121\ni,j+1 vi,j = e.\n\n(27)\n\nUsing then the symmetry of \u039bi,j , we eliminate the multipliers \u039bi,j to arrive at the\nfollowing expression:\nT\nT\n.\n\u2212 uTi\u22121,j \u2212 vi,j\u22121\nui,j + vi,j \u2212 ui\u22121,j \u2212 vi,j\u22121 = uTi,j + vi,j\n\nIf we view \u03c6 as a gl(n)-valued discrete one-form in the sense of \u00a72 2.2 , then the EulerPoincar\u00e9 equations can be conveniently expressed using the discrete codifferential:\n\u03b4\u03c6 = (\u03b4\u03c6)T ,\n\n(28)\n\nor [[\u03b4\u03c6]] = 0, where [[*]] denotes the antisymmetric part of a matrix: [[A]] = 21 (A \u2212 AT ).\nMany authors (see, for instance, [23, 5]) express the continuum equations for harmonic\nmappings taking values in a Lie group G with bi-invariant metric as d\u03b1 = 0 = \u03b4\u03b1,\nwhere \u03b1 is a g-valued one-form on the base space. Equations (27) and (28) are the\ndiscrete counterpart of these continuum equations.\n\n6\n6.1\n\nGeneralizations\nField theories on non-trivial base spaces\n\nUp until now, we considered discretizations of field theories with two independent variables, i.e. where the base space is R2 . From the beginning of the paper, we discretized\n18\n\n\fR2 by considering the square mesh (V, E, F ) in R2 whose vertices have integer coordinates. Other discretisations of R2 can be introduced as in [20] by noting that (V, E, F )\nis a planar graph; the theory of this paper can be readily generalized to the case of\narbitrary planar graphs.\nSecondly, the generalization to an arbitrary base space X, not necessarily R2 , is straightforward under the assumption that a simplicial complex can be embedded in X. Let\nus now briefly discuss this case.\nAs before, unreduced and reduced fields are maps associating a group element to each\n0-dimensional and 1-dimensional simplex, respectively. Other generalizations are also\npossible, for instance where one considers fields that associate group elements to higherdimensional simplices, but these types of fields do not arise in Euler-Poincar\u00e9 reduction\nand cannot be treated with the Lie groupoid framework of section 6.2. For an introduction to such field theories, see [22].\nThe theory of discrete differential forms starting from a simplicial complex and its dual\nis developed to great detail in [8, 10] for spaces of arbitrary dimension and topology.\nTo study discrete Lagrangian field theories, one now has to focus on the Cartesian\nproducts G\u00d7(n+1) and G\u00d7n , where n + 1 is the dimension of the base space. The usual\nprocedures of discrete Lagrangian field theories and discrete reduction of the previous\nsections carry through to this case without significant changes.\nA significant change occurs when the base space is not simply connected. In that case,\nproposition 2.6 is no longer valid. Consequently, a reduced field then no longer induces\na uniquely determined unreduced field. This is similar to the continuous case; see [5].\n\n6.2\n\nDiscrete field theories on Lie groupoids\n\nFor the better part of this paper, we have considered discrete field theories associating\ngroup elements to either the vertices (unreduced fields), or to the edges of the mesh\n(reduced fields). It turns out that both are special cases of discrete field theories taking\nvalues in Lie groupoids. This point of view was introduced in [20], to which we refer for\na detailed overview. In this section, we will briefly show how Lie groupoid field theories\nprovide a unified framework for Euler-Poincar\u00e9 reduction. We will focus mostly on a\nLie groupoid version of theorem 3.4, but note that other constructions, such as the\nNoether theorem and the Poincar\u00e9 forms of section 4, also have their counterpart in\nthe Lie groupoid framework.\nFor more information on Lie groupoids, as well as their role in discrete mechanics, the\nreader is referred to [13, 21, 14].\nA Lie groupoid is a set G with a partial multiplication m, a subset Q of G whose\nelements are called identities, two submersions \u03b1, \u03b2 : G \u2192 Q (called source and target\nmaps respectively), which both equal the identity on Q, and an inversion mapping\ni : G \u2192 G. A pair of Lie groupoid elements (g, h) is said to be composable if the\n19\n\n\fmultiplication m(g, h) is defined; the set of composable pairs will be denoted by G2 .\nWe will denote the multiplication m(g, h) by gh and the inversion i(g) by g \u22121. In\naddition, these data must satisfy the following properties, for all g, h, k \u2208 G:\n1. the pair (g, h) is composable if and only if \u03b2(g) = \u03b1(h), and then \u03b1(gh) = \u03b1(g)\nand \u03b2(gh) = \u03b2(h);\n2. if either (gh)k or g(hk) exists, then both do, and they are equal;\n3. \u03b1(g) and \u03b2(g) satisfy \u03b1(g)g = g and g\u03b2(g) = g;\n4. the inversion satisfies g \u22121g = \u03b2(g) and gg \u22121 = \u03b1(g).\nA Lie group G can be considered as a Lie groupoid over a singleton {e}: the source and\ntarget maps \u03b1 and \u03b2 map any group element onto e and the multiplication is defined\neverywhere.\nAnother example is the pair groupoid Q \u00d7 Q, where Q is a manifold. The pair groupoid\nis a Lie groupoid over Q, and the source and target mappings are defined as follows:\n\u03b1(q0 , q1 ) = q0 , and \u03b2(q0 , q1 ) = q1 . The multiplication of composable elements is then\ngiven by (q0 , q1 )(q1 , q2 ) = (q0 , q2 ). The set of units in Q \u00d7 Q is {(q, q) : q \u2208 Q}.\nA groupoid morphism is a pair of maps \u03c6 : G \u2192 G\u2032 and f : Q \u2192 Q\u2032 satisfying\n\u03b1\u2032 \u25e6 \u03c6 = f \u25e6 \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2032 \u25e6 \u03c6 = f \u25e6 \u03b2 and such that \u03c6(gh) = \u03c6(g)\u03c6(h) whenever (g, h) is\ncomposable. Note that (\u03c6(g), \u03c6(h)) is a composable pair whenever (g, h) is composable.\n6.2.1\n\nDiscrete fields\n\nThe set of edges E is a subset of the pair groupoid V \u00d7 V , but it is not a groupoid\nin itself because the multiplication of two elements of E is not necessarily again an\nelement of E. Nevertheless, it turns out that much can be gained from considering E\nas a \"local groupoid\" in the sense of [20], rather than just as a subset of V \u00d7 V . By\na \"local groupoid\", we mean here that, even if the multiplication is not defined in E,\none can still define composable edges as pairs of edges e1 , e2 , such that \u03b2(e2 ) = \u03b1(e1 ),\nwhere \u03b1(x0 , x1 ) = x0 and \u03b2(x0 , x1 ) = x1 , i.e. \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the usual source and target\nmappings of the pair groupoid V \u00d7 V , restricted to E. Hence, E is a groupoid in all\naspects but one, the multiplication.\nWith the conventions introduced above, we have for e = (x0 , x1 ) that e\u22121 = (x1 , x0 ).\nIn addition to the mesh (V, E) in R2 , we now consider an arbitrary Lie groupoid \u0393\nover a manifold Q. The idea is to define discrete fields as mappings from the \"local\ngroupoid\" E to the Lie groupoid \u0393. In particular, if \u03c6 is a discrete field, then \u03c6 maps\ncomposable edges in E to composable elements in \u0393, and, secondly, if e is any edge in\nE, then \u03c6(e\u22121 ) = \u03c6(e)\u22121 . This is worked out in more detail in the following definition:\nDefinition 6.1. A discrete field is a pair \u03c6 = (\u03c6(0) , \u03c6(1) ), where \u03c6(0) is a map from V\nto Q and \u03c6(1) is a map from E to \u0393 such that\n20\n\n\f1. \u03b1(\u03c6(1) (x, y)) = \u03c6(0) (x) and \u03b2(\u03c6(1) (x, y)) = \u03c6(0) (y);\n2. for each (x, y) \u2208 E, \u03c6(1) (y, x) = [\u03c6(1) (x, y)]\u22121 ;\n3. for each x \u2208 V , \u03c6(1) (x, x) = \u03c6(0) (x) \u2208 Q.\nEven though we are working with an object E which is not quite a groupoid, it turns\nout that any discrete field \u03c6 : E \u2192 \u0393 may be extended to an actual groupoid morphism\nfrom V \u00d7 V to \u0393. This can be shown quite easily; for a proof, we refer to proposition 7\nin [20]. Note that proposition 2.6 is a special case of this extension property.\nExample 6.2. Consider a discrete field (\u03c6(0) , \u03c6(1) ) taking values in the pair groupoid\nQ \u00d7 Q. Because of the conditions in definition 6.1, the map \u03c6(1) : V \u00d7 V \u2192 Q \u00d7 Q,\nis equal to \u03c6(0) \u00d7 \u03c6(0) . In this case, the discrete field is completely specified once we\nare given \u03c6(0) : V \u2192 Q. For Q = G, this corresponds to the class of unreduced fields\nstudied in section 3.\n\u22c4\nExample 6.3. Consider now the case where the Lie groupoid \u0393 is a Lie group G and\nlet (\u03c6(0) , \u03c6(1) ) be a discrete field. As \u03c6(0) (x) = e for all x \u2208 V , a discrete field can\nbe identified with a map \u03c6(1) : V \u00d7 V \u2192 G. As in section 3.3, this is a flat discrete\nconnection, or, equivalently, a reduced field.\n\u22c4\n6.2.2\n\nReduction\n\nThe previous two examples show that the Lie groupoid framework encompasses both\nthe case of unreduced and reduced fields (when \u0393 = G \u00d7 G or \u0393 = G, respectively).\nThe following theorem shows that the Euler-Poincar\u00e9 reduction of one Lie groupoid\nfield theory yields another one:\nTheorem 6.4 (see [20]). Let \u0393\u2032 be a Lie groupoid over a manifold Q\u2032 and consider a\nmorphism (\u03a6, f ) : (\u0393, Q) \u2192 (\u0393\u2032 , Q\u2032 ). Furthermore, let L\u2032 : G\u2032k \u2192 R be a Lagrangian on\nG\u2032k and consider the induced Lagrangian L = L\u2032 \u25e6 \u03a8 on Gk , where \u03a8 : Gk \u2192 G\u2032k is the\nmap associated to \u03a6.\nA morphism \u03c6 : V \u00d7 V \u2192 \u0393 will satisfy the discrete field equations for L if the induced\nmorphism \u03a6 \u25e6 \u03c6 : V \u00d7 V \u2192 \u0393\u2032 satisfies the discrete field equations for L\u2032 .\nLemma 6.5. If the morphism (\u03a6, f ) in theorem 6.4 is a submersion, then a discrete\nfield \u03c6 : V \u2192 V \u2192 \u0393 will satisfy the discrete field equations for L if and only if the\ninduced field \u03a6 \u25e6 \u03c6 : V \u00d7 V \u2192 \u0393\u2032 satisfies the field equations for L\u2032 .\nProof: The proof follows that of Corollary 4.7 in [14].\n\n\u22c4\n\nA few remarks are in order here. The manifold Gk consists of sequences of k composable\nelements (g1 , g2, * * * , gk ) in \u0393, such that g1 * g2 * * * gk is a unit:\nGk = {(g1 , g2 , . . . , gk ) \u2208 G\u00d7k : \u03b1(gi+1) = \u03b2(gi ), \u03b1(g1) = \u03b2(gk ) and\ng1 * g2 * * * gk = e\u03b1(g1 ) }.\n21\n\n\fThe manifold Gk is the manifold where the Lagrangian is defined, and as such it is the\ngeneralization to the case of Lie groupoids of the Cartesian products G \u00d7 G \u00d7 G and\nG\u00d7G used in section 3.1. It is straightforward to check that, for k = 3, G3 = G\u00d7G\u00d7G\nwhen \u0393 = G \u00d7 G, and G3 = G \u00d7 G for \u0393 = G.\nThe map \u03a6 : G \u00d7 G \u2192 G, introduced in section 3.1, and defined as \u03a6(g, g \u2032) = g \u22121 g \u2032,\nis a Lie groupoid morphism. When we put \u0393 = G \u00d7 G and \u0393\u2032 = G, and use \u03a6 in\ntheorem 6.4, we obtain the reduction theorem 3.4. In contrast to discrete mechanics,\nit is not very likely that a reconstruction theorem can be proved in the context of Lie\ngroupoids; in the case of Lie groups, for instance, there is the obstruction of flatness.\n\n7\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nIn this paper, we have shown that the well-known concepts of symmetry and EulerPoincar\u00e9 reduction can be extended by very modest means to the case of discrete field\ntheories. It turned out that many of the constructions known from continuum field\ntheories have a natural discrete counterpart. However, much remains to be done.\nThroughout the text, we remarked that almost all of our constructions can be extended\nto the case of field theories taking values in an arbitrary Lie groupoid \u0393. Such a\nframework might be useful in the case of general Lagrangian reduction. In addition,\nas we pointed out before, many of the definitions introduced here gain much in clarity\nwhen rephrased in this more general language.\nAs a second point of interest, we are also interested in the concept of multisymplecticity. Because of their variational nature, it is to be expected that the Euler-Poincar\u00e9\nequations are multisymplectic in the sense of [16, 4]. However, as the focus of this\narticle was on theoretical developments rather than on the construction of practical\nintegration schemes, we have chosen to leave this topic for future work.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author is a Research Assistant of the Research Foundation - Flanders (Belgium),\nwhose financial support is gratefully acknowledged.
