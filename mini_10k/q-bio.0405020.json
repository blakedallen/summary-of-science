Twenty types of amino acids can occur in proteins. To form a\nprotein, these twenty amino acids are strung together in a precise sequence. It is this\nsequence which determines the three dimensional shape into which the proteins will fold,\nas well as its activity. In order to proceed from the genome to function one may need to\nknow the interpretation of the protein structure as to its function. However, since the\nfunction may depend on the permutation of these amino acids (with repeats) along the\nlengthy protein scaffold, this may be practically an NP problem. Fortunately, recently the\nadvent of signal processing methods and information technology are leading to solutions\nthat bode well for the medical profession, the drug discovery process, the quality of life\nand the longevity of mankind. The quantification of biological networks into expression\n\n1\n\n\fis also a well nigh NP problem as in physics the network problems that have led to\napproximate solutions were all regular lattices and the e.g., PPI (protein-protein\ninteractome networks) are irregular webs.\nSignal Processing2,3,4,5,6\nSignal processing is not a new technology. For example the IR, microwave and Raman\nstructure of molecules were used to determine their thermodynamic function using\nstatistical mechanics which led to solutions of their complex equilibrium and reaction rate\nresults using computers for many years. Thus spectroscopy, akin to signal processing, led\nto significant results. The problems that arose with biological molecules is that they can\nbe quite large and the computation of their vibrations, rotations, etc. becomes a very\ndifficult problem indeed. Results using a computer program called Chemkin have shown,\nhowever, that the kinetics of small biological molecules are solvable. A program called\nTherm does find thermodynamic functions for small molecules and can theoretically find\nsuch data for large molecules with proper data input. There are encouraging reports that\nscientists in Japan are to publish thermodynamic functions for biological molecules.\nIn a book by Cosic, The Resonant Recognition Model of Macromolecular Bioactivity, the\nelectrons along a protein molecule are considered as delocalized and the charges moving\nalong the protein backbone as productive of electromagnetic effects, whose spectral\ncharacteristics, that correspond to their energy distribution, correspond to their energy\ndistribution along the protein. A numerical sequence representing each amino acid in the\nsequence is then associated with a corresponding electron-ion interaction value. Signal\nprocessing techniques were then applied to protein (and gene) sequences to search for\ninformation embedded in these biological systems. Now signal processing techniques\nhave been applied most everywhere in bioinformatics and will continue to play an\nimportant role in the study of biomedical problems. Thus the frequency spectra was\ndescribed with the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) technique. Comparison of results for\ngroups of proteins, which performed a similar function, showed that all possessed a wave\nform in common, a single characteristic frequency. Different groups of proteins\nperforming different functions had a different characteristic frequency. Also, receptor\ntarget molecules. to which particular proteins bind, had a matching characteristic to the\nligand molecule.\nThe Fourier method discovered \"global\" periodicities and could not extract hidden\nlocalized periodicity very well. These could be useful for underlying construction rules.\nSuch a correlation function could compare each DNA base with its various neighbors.\nRegular features in DNA sequences were observed after further Fourier and wavelet\nprocessing. Significant features of the DNA sequence showed that the noncoding\nsequences had spectra similar to random sequences, while coding sequences revealed\nspecific periodicities of both variable length and also a common periodicity of three.\nWavelet methods were also used later to represent the spectra of proteins. Furthermore,\nthe spectra were transformed from many peaks to singular characteristic peaks that\nrepresented the protein for docking purposes (which is usually used in the process of drug\n\n2\n\n\fdiscovery). Further work by others stated that this representation of a protein by one\ncharacteristic frequency is not valid and instead should be placed by several characteristic\nfrequencies.\nConsidering that the Hartree-Fock approximation of quantum mechanics was applied to\nsuch a complex problem, and that some literature sources apply the band structure of\nsolid state physics to this problem and that so much emphasis was placed on one property\n(the EIIP) to be the sole important characterizing property of these proteins; how valid\ncan these working hypotheses be? According to Veljkovic, molecular electrostatic\npotential provides a basis for the initial assessment of specific biological activity of a\nmolecule. The potential that is created around a molecule is what is \"sensed\" by another\nmolecule in its vicinity. Such interactions are effective in less than 2 angstroms and is a\n\"short-distance interaction\" (SDI). Besides the electrostatic phenomena, the 3-D\nstructures of the molecules are important. Veljkovic believes that the electrostatic\npotential is also important in the \"recognition\" processes that enzyme substrates or drugreceptor interactions display. This second interaction, which is termed the \"long-distance\ninteraction\" (LDI), occurs when the molecule and its receptor are at a relatively large\nseparation (100-1000 angstroms). It directly influences a number of productive collisions\nbetween interacting biochemical molecules and their kinetics. This potential involves\nmolecular processes such as receptor-ligand, antibody-antigen and enzyme-substrate\nkinds. A psuedopotential parameter was used, the electron-ion interaction potential\n(EIIP), for development of the ISM (Informational Spectrum Model), a virtual\nspectroscopy method for informational analysis of protein and nucleotide sequences. The\nsignal obtained has been decomposed in periodical functions by Fourier transformation.\nThe result is a series of frequencies and amplitudes. This technique allowed detection of\ncode/frequency pairs, characteristic for interacting molecules, and for determining their\nspecific long-distance recognition and targeting. The ISM has helped elucidate structural\nmotifs with defined physico-chemical interacting molecules, determining their specific\nlong-distance recognition and targeting. ISM has been used for structure/function\nanalysis of protein and DNA sequences, as well as for denovo design of biologically\nactive peptides.\nStambuk et alia state the Cosic model was confirmed by successful prediction of\nmacromolecular receptor binding, enzyme and oncogene activity, protein-DNA\ninteractions and bioactive parts of cytokines, hormones, viral proteins and antibodies.\nHowever, the problem of defining its structural classes was not solved by the single\ncharacteristic approach. A single common characteristic frequency is often not found due\nto sequence diversity irrespective of the secondary structure. They then analyzed a\nlimited number of the most prominent frequency peaks in the protein spectrum of\ndifferent folds. The pattern recognition of protein EIIP frequency periodogram obtained\nby spectral Fourier analysis enabled classification of the secondary protein folds. A single\nperiodogram peak has a low information content, unable to provide a discriminating\nparameter for the complex structure, which is highly diverse, and consequently often\nspectrally deviant, with respect to the species and function. The decision tree based\npattern analysis of Fourier periodogram frequency peaks seemed to provide a useful\n\n3\n\n\falternative to the common frequency determination, since it enabled accurate recognition\nof \u03b1- and \u03b2-protein folding types.\nA method7,8 for condensing the information in multiple alignments of proteins into a\nmixture of Dirichlet densities over amino distributions exists. Dirichlet mixture densities\nare designed to be combined with observed amino acid frequencies to form estimates of\nexpected amino acid probabilities at each position in a profile hidden Markov model, or\nother statistical model. These estimates give a statistical model greater generalization\ncapacity, so that remotely related family members can be more reliably recognized by the\nmethod. The method employed to estimate and use Dirichlet mixture priors are based\nfirmly on Bayesian statistics. While biological knowledge has been introduced only\nindirectly from the multiple alignments used to estimate the mixture parameters, the\nmixture priors produced agree with accepted biological understanding. The effectiveness\nof Dirichlet mixtures for increasing the ability of statistical models to recognize\nhomologous sequences has been demonstrated experimentally.\nSYNPROPS and KNAPSACK9,10, 11, 12\nIn books written by the author, two programs are introduced. One is called SYNPROPS,\nthe other is called KNAPSACK. The former obtains physical properties for molecules\nusing chemical groups that have been obtained from experimental data. This program has\nbeen used to approximate physical properties for amino acids and also for segments of\nproteins containing amino acids. The later program determines the frequency of fifteen of\nthe amino acids contained in a protein of given length with constraints on the physical\nproperties of the protein. This was done for the physical properties studied9,10. One\nobjective was to see how the properties studied before were related to the EIIP.\nSYNPROPS uses the data and formulas of Cramer that are inserted into a spread sheet\nprogram such that once the composition of molecules is given in terms of molecular\ngroups, the properties of designated molecules can be ascertained to a given level of\naccuracy. Cramer derived the data originally for the molecules with data from the\nhandbooks of chemistry and physics and the predictions of properties of other molecules\nwere deemed to be accurate and the statistics used in the whole process were above\nsuspicion. The SYNPROPS matrix of data and formulas were also used in the usual\noptimizing programs contained in the PC spreadsheet programs of Quattro Pro, Excel,\netc., so that one could find the best structures of molecules (and mixtures of molecules)\nfor desired properties, and furthermore, the whole procedure was reduced to one where\nmethods of matrix algebra could be utilized to proceed backwards and forwards in the\nmanipulation of properties and structures of molecules. These methods were used for\ndetermining properties for biological molecules, such as amino acids and proteins and in\napplications such as environmental substitutions, toxicity and drug discovery.\n\n4\n\n\fTable 1\nresidue\nala\nasn\nasp\ncys\ngln\nglu\ngly\niso\nleu\nlys\nmet\nphe\nser\nthr\nval\n\ndipole\n1.63945\n4.67705\n3.07055\n2.38845\n4.56335\n2.95685\n1.77355\n1.34775\n1.34775\n2.06725\n2.31305\n1.77705\n2.88225\n2.81825\n1.46145\n\n-logparc\n2.8998\n5.21377\n4.40374\n3.32977\n4.69192\n3.88189\n3.42677\n1.46208\n1.46208\n3.24955\n2.62797\n1.47151\n4.72784\n4.333789\n1.98392\n\nV/20\n3.74845\n4.43545\n4.27155\n4.2553\n5.2949\n5.131\n2.88915\n6.456\n6.456\n6.4425\n6.00895\n7.0071\n3.4832\n4.47185\n5.59655\n\nhydrophob\n-2.60426\n-1.44596\n-7.37356\n-4.04259\n-0.94134\n-6.86894\n-2.93481\n-0.4382\n-0.4382\n-7.57275\n1.53475\n-3.35187\n-7.33078\n6.17395\n0.94282\n\nlogactco\n6.577995\n14.93858\n12.51525\n9.367475\n14.83021\n12.40688\n6.678975\n6.200525\n6.200525\n10.6585\n8.950935\n8.556295\n11.63029\n11.46956\n6.308895\n\nsol par\n8.27661\n16.16167\n13.07255\n10.638\n15.962\n12.872\n8.48389\n7.39963\n7.39963\n9.65799\n9.48157\n9.13923\n12.25083\n11.77301\n7.59921\n\nCHI\n35.3748\n13.8594\n21.6879\n30.5513\n16.3845\n24.2147\n32.8367\n42.7831\n42.7831\n32.0947\n35.9034\n41.7417\n21.2775\n23.6356\n40.258\n\nmol refract\n17.11992\n25.02192\n23.64277\n23.50322\n29.53745\n28.1583\n12.61641\n30.72551\n30.72551\n34.65878\n33.5721\n41.19408\n17.85461\n2.42914\n26.20998\n\nEIIP\n1.865\n0.18\n6.315\n8.29\n3.805\n0.29\n0.5\n0\n0\n1.855\n8.23\n4.73\n8.29\n4.705\n2.85\n\nKNAPSACK is a program adopted from discrete mathematics and also is processed on a\nspreadsheet such as Excel or Quattro Pro. It calculates the optimum distribution of\nobjects that can be contained in a chromosome, if the property values for each object can\nvary to a different degree. Originally, it calculated the frequency of each amino acid in a\nprotein if the protein was limited to a maximum number of amino acids. Then it was also\nextended to also determine the practical appropriate sequence of these amino acids in the\nprotein. The number of amino acids considered was fifteen instead of twenty because the\ndata to regress the properties of the five remaining amino acids with their structure was\nnot available at the time but this can be addressed in the future. The KNAPSACK\nprogram utilizes the variables ni for the number of each of the amino acid residue i and Pi\nfor the particular property for the amino acid residue i. Then the summation Sum (i = 1 to\ni = 15) for the function S = ni Pi from i = 1 to i = 15 is maximized or minimized\naccording to what particular property Pi represents. Now the summation of N =ni (from i\n= 1 to i = 15) is fixed according to the length of the peptide or the protein chain. This\nmeans the extreme of the of sum of S = niPi is found under the constraint that the sum of\nni (N) is a fixed number. When this is done and the values of ni are allowed to vary while\nthe extremum of S = niPi is found, under the constraint that the sum of ni is a fixed value,\nthen the spectrum of the values of each of the variables ni is found (where each of these\nvalues is the number of each particular amino acid residue found). This is then the\nfrequency spectrum of amino acids under the conditions that were set.\nKnapsack uses the physical properties in the above table, eight of which come from\nSYNPROPS and that for EIIP from the literature for the fifteen amino acids. The total\nnumber of amino acids is fixed to any number desired. A property or function of any or\nall of the properties can be maximized or minimized, Each number of the amino acids in\nthe result is constrained to be an integer and any number of them can be constrained to be\nabove, below, equal to or between any set of numbers desired.\n\n5\n\n\fCodon Graphlets\nThe genetic code is shown in Table 2.\nTable 2\n\nT\nTTT Phe (F)\nTTC \"\nT TTA Leu (L)\nTTG \"\n\nC\nTCT Ser (S)\nTCC \"\nTCA \"\nTCG \"\n\nA\nTAT Tyr (Y)\nTAC\nTAA Ter\nTAG Ter\n\nG\nTGT Cys (C)\nTGC\nTGA Ter\nTGG Trp (W)\n\nCTT Leu (L)\nCTC \"\nC CTA \"\nCTG \"\n\nCCT Pro (P)\nCCC \"\nCCA \"\nCCG \"\n\nCAT His (H)\nCAC \"\nCAA Gln (Q)\nCAG \"\n\nCGT Arg (R)\nCGC \"\nCGA \"\nCGG \"\n\nATT Ile (I)\nATC \"\nA ATA \"\nATG Met (M)\n\nACT Thr (T)\nACC \"\nACA \"\nACG \"\n\nAAT Asn (N)\nAAC \"\nAAA Lys (K)\nAAG \"\n\nAGT Ser (S)\nAGC \"\nAGA Arg (R)\nAGG \"\n\nGTT Val (V)\nGTC \"\nGGTA \"\nGTG \"\n\nGCT Ala (A)\nGCC \"\nGCA \"\nGCG \"\n\nGAT Asp (D)\nGAC \"\nGAA Glu (E)\nGAG \"\n\nGGT Gly (G)\nGGC \"\nGGA \"\nGGG \"\n\nYou may notice this is like a matrix of symbols. There are three sets of boxes: 1) on the\ndiagonal are four boxes of codons for particular amino acids, phe, pro, lys, gly,.that have\nthree identical letters (triplets), 2) the second set consists of six boxes containing codons\nwith the same amino acid, leu, val, ser, thr, ala, and arg, The last set contains codons\nincluding the amino acids cys and ser, the amino acids with the highest EIIP, in addition\nto phe, leu, iso, met, tyr, his, gln, asp, glu, trp, and arg. A codon can be represented as a\ntriangle with the symbols of the nucleotide bases at the vertices. The ones that are triplets\ncan form a graphlet with four triangles where three of them have common bases (or\nbonds) with the central triangle (a triplet). Other codons can form a graphlet that is a\nrhombus composed of two triangles with a common base. The internal regularity\ndisplayed by the genetic code has been recognized to include physico chemical property\ncorrelation, biosynthetic relation of amino acids and the non-random pattern of the\ngenetic code. It is interesting to note that KNAPSACK selected the following amino\nacids as most favorable for the properties listed as: asn; partition coefficient, activity\ncoefficient, solubility parameter, dipole moment, leu; CHI, asp; EIIP, lys;\nhydrophobicity, gly; volume, and phe; molar refractivity.\nIn an early paper13, 14, 15, 16 a regular triangular lattice was broken up into subfigures. The\nsubfigures were related by normalization, consistency and equilibrium equations. The\n\n6\n\n\flatter relations were derived from statistical mechanics and minimization of free energy.\nIn the more complicated network above, we may see a way to follow a similar procedure\nto treat not only biomolecular networks, but also ligands of proteins docked onto DNA\nand onto other proteins as well.\nQSARs\nRegression in grossly undetermined systems has emerged as an important means for\nunderstanding molecular activity via Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships\n(QSAR). These model the relationship activities and physiochemical properties of a set of\ncompounds and they are fundamental to many aspects of the drug design process. The\ninformation from a QSAR approach can provide an explanation for the observed\ndifferences in binding affinity. It can also provide a quantitative method for the design\nand prediction of novel potential drug molecules. The methods described here predict\nphysical characteristics of molecules for which no experimental data are available. These\ncan then be used to improve the model of how a drug interacts with its target. QSAR\nstudies can also be applied to near-infrared spectroscopy.\nMultiobjective Search\nMultiobjective optimization is also very useful for such a purpose. Here an objective\nfunction is used that encodes all of the desired selection criteria and then a simulated\nannealing or evolutionary approach is added to identify the optimal (or nearly optimal)\nsubset from among a vast number of possibilities. Many design criteria can be\naccommodated; those that may be diverse or similar to known actives, etc., and the\npredicted and/or selectively determined molecules of merit found.\nRegression and Matrix Formulation\nAn equation was used for each amino acid:\n\u03a3i ai Pi = P [EIIP]\nwhere i varied from 1 to 8, signifying the eight properties studied before. Then the matrix\nequation was used:\nA P =P [EIIP]\nwhere the matrix A represents the matrix of coefficients in the above equations and P the\nrespective numerical properties. Then\nA-1AP = A-1P[EIIP] or P = A-1P[EIIP]\nEIIP=a1(Dipole Moment)+a2(Ln Activity Coefficient)+a3(Volume/20)+a4(Molar\nRefractivity)-a5(Ln Partition Coefficient)+a6(Hydrophobicity)+a7(Solubility\nParameter)+a8(CHI)\n\n7\n\n\fThe ratios of the coefficients were a1/a2/a3/a4/a5/a6/a7/a8=1/.33/.13/.06/.01/.01/.00 so the\nlast two terms for the properties CHI and solubility parameter could be neglected. This\nwas because their property was assimilated in the other properties and their contributions\nwere minor. In deriving the inverse of a matrix the original matrix must be square. The\nresulting equation was\nEIIP=a1(Dipole Moment)+a2(Ln Activity Coefficient)+a3(Volume/20)+a4(Molar\nRefractivity)-a5(Ln Partition Coefficient)+a6(Hydrophobicity)\nIn order to solve the matrix equations above the functions of finding the inverse of the\nmatrix A and the function of matrix multiply functions of Excel and Quattro Pro were\nused.\nIt was found that the above equation could be solved, that is, that the property EIIP was a\nlinear function of the six properties designated in the above equation. Thus the single\nfrequency found above is a compendium of such other properties but the use of more than\none frequency can be validated in more detail. In using KNAPSACK, the maximum\nfunctions of each of the properties were pointing to asn, asn, gly, phe, asn, and lys, resp.,\nfor the first through the sixth optimum property as can be seen from the Table 1, but the\nproperty of EIIP was a mixture of cys and ser, respectively. When the equation was\noptimized for the best amino acid overall, the amino acid serine was found with the\ncoefficients used.\nHomology Modeling Interactome: Scale-Free or Geometric?17\nA random geometric model provides a more accurate model of the PPI data than the\ncurrently popular scale-free model. In the random geometric model the term graphlet is\nused to denote a connected network with a small number of nodes. The graphlet\nfrequency is the number of occurrences of a graphlet in a network and it is a parameter\nthat shows that the PPI networks are closest to geometric random graphs. The relative\nfrequency of graphlets Ni(G)/T(G) characterizes PPI networks and the networks chosen\nto model them. Here Ni(G) is the total number of graphlets of type i in a network G and\nT(G) = \u03a3Ni(G) is the total number of graphlets of G. The similarity between two graphs\nshould be independent of the total number of edges, and depend only upon the\ndifferences between the relative frequencies of graphlets. The relative graphlet frequency\ndistance D(G,H) between two graphs G and H is defined as D(G,H)=\u03a3|Fi(G)-Fi(H)|,\nwhere Fi(G)=-log(Ni(G)/T(G)). Then the distances between several real-world PPI\nnetworks and the corresponding SF and GEO random networks were computed and the\nGEO random networks fit the data an order of magnitude better in the higher-confidence\nPPI networks and less so in the more noisier PPI networks, except for a fruitfly PPI\nnetwork with lower confidence interactions. The analysis of the diameters and clustering\ncoefficients further solidifies these results. The fact that the PPI itself may have been\nmade with questionable data18 and that a protein may have more than one function19 is\npointed out in recent literature. The geometric protein-protein interactome bears a striking\nresemblance to the order disorder treatment of lattices that occurred in the literature many\nyears ago13.\n\n8\n\n\fThe Orchestral Analog of Molecular Biology21\nWe have sheet music for solo instruments and orchestra. Each instrument or section of an\norchestra has staffs in the score. It now is apparent that the properties are like musical\nnotes and the amino acids are like the instruments or sections of an orchestra in\npolyphonic music and the lines in the staffs are the sorted properties expressed as if they\nare the pitch levels in a musical composition. Now the sections in an orchestra may be\ncomposed of many instruments and so is DNA. There are nucleotides between the genes\nwhose true meaning or expression are yet to be understood. A musical composition\nemerges from musical notes in time and the graphlets or motifs are connected in\npathways and networks that yields melodies and all the other creations in music as does\nthe DNA and proteins that engage in the process of life. We cannot do signal processing\non one property alone because life is more complex. It must be considered as a\n\"polyphonic\" analog of music. This can be done by using tables such as that shown as\nTable 1. Each line of the staff represents the level of a property that, taken together for all\nthe lines and staffs, expresses the composite of the property characteristics. Such\ninformation can be derived from a plot of sequences that are observed in laboratories\nfrom organisms. It is hoped that the numbers derived for the properties are accurate in the\nfuture. Care must be undertaken by scientists to obtain such numbers. For the moment I\nhope that \"it is more important to be consistent than accurate in thermodynamics\"22.\nConclusions\nAdvantage of the signal processing techniques should be extended to other properties\nthan have been used before to provide information useful for disease examination and\ndrug discovery. The use of QSAR (quantitative structure activity relations) will also be\nuseful in such studies. Multiobjective goals are to be more frequent and the programs of\nSYNPROPS and KNAPSACK can be useful in uncovering the relation of properties,\nfunctions and sequences of DNA and proteins. Geometrical networks must be used more\noften and protein-protein interactomes are to be carefully constructed from valid data.\nMore information can be found from careful analysis of the genetic code. The internal\nregularity displayed by the genetic code has been recognized to include physicochemical\nproperty correlation, biosynthetic relation of amino acids and the non-random pattern of\nthe genetic code20. Although the work above has only been carried out with fifteen amino\nacids, it will be worth the effort to extend this work to all twenty amino acids. This can be\naccomplished extending the programs, THERM and SYNPROPS and also it is hoped\nfrom work to be published from RIKEN in Japan.\n\n9\n\n\fAppendix 1\nAs an example of the knapsack results, when the following properties are maximized:\ndipole moment, hydrophobicity, partition coefficient, EIIP, activity coefficient and molar\nrefractivity and the volume is minimized we find that the program KNAPSACK finds the\nfollowing results when, at the same time, the number of amino acids is set at 1000, the\nnumber of each amino acid is an integer and greater than zero:\ndipole\nmoment\nmaximum value\nconstraint\n\nhydrophobicity\n\nvolume\n\nEIIP\n\nmolar\nrefraction/5\n\n4677\n\n-7573\n\n-5213\n\n57783\n\n8290\n\n14939\n\n8239\n\n=6000\n\n=-5000\n\n=60000\n\n=8000\n\n=14000\n\n=8000\n\n790\n\nasp\n\n32\n\n692\n417\n\ncys\n\n38\n\ngly\n\n3\n\nphe\n\n611\n\n61\n\n1000\n\n66\n14\n\n813\n\n16\n21\n\n142\n\n843\n85\n\n187\n\n51\n\nmet\n\n7\n\ngln\n\n114\n\nglu\n\n25\n\n128\n\nlys\nthr\n\nactivity\ncoefficient\n\n=4500\n\nasn\n\nser\n\npartition\ncoefficient\n\n83\n\n104\n\n23\n\n64\n\n56\n\n48\n\n150\n17\n\n106\n\n157\n\n35\n\nSince the inverse matrix had to be square and number of amino acids were fifteen and the\nnumber of properties considered were nine the solutions of the matrix equation had to be\ndivided into sets of nine and six as shown.\nAppendix 2\nUsing matrices on nine of the fifteen amino acids and their properties, we find that the\nratio of the nine coefficients aij of the equation are as shown in case I below.
