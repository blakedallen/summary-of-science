We have obtained 1.4 GHz VLA\u2212A\nconfiguration data on 57 of these sources to investigate whether the extended\nluminosity of blazars is correlated with parsec\u2212scale jet speed, and also to determine what other parsec\u2212scale properties are related to extended morphology,\nsuch as optical emission line strength and gamma\u2212ray emission. We present\nimages and measurements of the kilo-parsec scale emission from the VLA data,\nwhich will be used in subsequent statistical studies of the MOJAVE sample.\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nSubject headings: galaxies : active - galaxies : jets - quasars : general -\nradio continuum : galaxies - BL Lacertae objects : general -\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBlazars are an extreme class of radio source that represent only a small percentage of\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN), yet dominate the sky at high energies. They are characterized\nby highly relativistic jets that are oriented toward us with a very small angle of incidence.\nThis often results in apparent superluminal jet motions that are caused by a Doppler compression in the apparent time duration of signals from the source. This creates an ideal set of\ncircumstances for studying the kinematics of jets, since many decades of evolution are often\ncompressed into much shorter timescales. MOJAVE (Monitoring of Jets in Active galactic\nnuclei with VLBA Experiments) is a long term program that seeks to better understand the\nphysics of AGN on the parsec\u2212scale via regularly\u2212spaced, high resolution VLBA observations (Kellermann et al. 1998, 2004; Lister & Homan 2005). The MOJAVE sample contains\n133 sources satisfying the criteria,\n\u2022 J2000 Declination > \u221220\u25e6\n\u2022 Galactic latitude |b| > 2.5\u25e6\n\u2022 VLBA 2 cm correlated flux density exceeding 1.5 Jy (2 Jy for declination south of 0\u25e6 )\nat any epoch between 1994 and 2003.\nBy selecting on the basis of compact flux density at a short wavelength, the sample favors\nhighly beamed relativistic jets (i.e., blazars). This makes it well suited for quantifying the\nstrong selection effects associated with blazar samples (Lister & Marscher 1997).\nAn important goal of the MOJAVE program is to gain a better understanding of how\nAGN jets evolve from parsec to kiloparsec\u2212scales. Parsec\u2212scale jet speed information on the\nsample is nearly complete (Lister et al., in preparation), and a distinct upper envelope is seen\nin a plot of maximum observed jet speed versus parsec\u2212scale jet luminosity (Cohen et al.\n2007). The shape of this envelope is suggestive of an intrinsic correlation between jet speed\nand synchrotron luminosity. Early hydrodynamic models (Blandford & Rees 1974) predict\nsuch behavior, and if verified, would prove useful for constraining more recent numerical\nmodels of jet production that include full magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) and general relativistic (GR) effects (e.g., Kato, Mineshige & Shibata 2004).\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nThe interpretation of the envelope is complicated by the fact that the apparent luminosity of blazar jets is strongly affected by the bulk Doppler factor (\u03b4), of the flow. The\nlatter quantity is dependent on the Lorentz factor and viewing angle of the jet, which also\naffect the apparent speed. An alternate means of testing the intrinsic speed/luminosity\ncorrelation is to compare the apparent jet speeds with extended (radio lobe) emission on\nkiloparsec\u2212scales. The extended emission is not appreciably beamed and is well-correlated\nwith the total jet power (Giovannini et al. 1988).\nSeveral extended flux density surveys that include blazars have been carried out with\nthe VLA (e.g., Antonucci & Ulvestad 1985; Murphy, Browne & Perley 1993; Cassaro 1999;\nRector, & Stocke 2001). However, none of these samples were as large or complete as MOJAVE, and they lacked parsec\u2212scale kinematic information. In order to measure the relatively weak extended radio emission in the presence of a strong, highly beamed blazar core\ncomponent, images with good angular resolution and very high dynamic range are necessary.\nAlthough better resolution can be achieved at higher observing frequencies, the extended\nemission becomes faint because of the steep spectral index. We have therefore sought to\nobtain deep VLA\u2212A configuration images of the entire MOJAVE sample at 1.4 GHz, which\nrepresents a reasonable compromise between angular resolution and sensitivity to extended\nemission. Here we present images of 57 MOJAVE sources; data on the remaining objects\n(from the VLA archive and other observations) will be presented in an upcoming publication.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nThe observations were made with the VLA in the A configuration, which yields a typical\nrestoring beam of 1.5\u2032\u2032 (FWHM), at an observing frequency of 1.4 GHz. To minimize the\npossible effects of radio interference, and to improve the dynamic range, the data were\nrecorded in spectral line mode, with 8 channels per IF. Right\u2212 and left\u2212hand circular\npolarization data at 1.36 GHz and 1.44 GHz were each assigned to one of four IFs, each\nhaving bandwidth of 25 MHz. The observations took place during filler time on six separate\ndates between 2004 September 19 and 2004 November 24 (Table 1). To maximize (u,v)\ncoverage, two scans of approximately five\u2212minutes duration, separated in hour angle, were\nmade on each source. Two sources, 0059+581 and 0109+224, had less than 10 minutes\nintegration time, due to scheduling constraints. Data on three high declination sources\n(0016+731, 1150+812, 1459+718) were not analyzed due to poor (u,v) coverage.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nCalibration of the data was performed in the AIPS 1 and Difmap 2 packages. Initial\nphase calibration was carried out in AIPS using the most compact sources observed during\neach run, with further iterations of imaging and self-calibration done on each source in\nDIFMAP. Careful attention was paid to image over the entire extent of the VLA primary\nbeam, in order to mitigate the effects of fainter sources in the field on the dynamic range.\nThis procedure yielded typical r.m.s. noise levels of 0.14 mJy beam\u22121 and dynamic ranges\nof \u223c 15000 : 1 (Figure 1). For each source, the flux density of the core component (Score )\nwas determined in AIPS by fitting a Gaussian component to the image with JMFIT. The\nsize of the fitted Gaussians (FWHM) were in close agreement with the size of the restoring\nbeam. The total flux density was determined by summing the flux density within a box fitted\naround the extent of the source. The extended flux density of the source was calculated using\nSext = Stotal \u2212 Score . The r.m.s. noise was measured in a blank sky region well away from\nthe source. These values are listed in Table 2, and the distribution of extended flux density\nvalues is shown in Figure 2.\nThe images of several sources (0202+149, 0212+735, 0552+398, 0642+449, 1324+224,\n1417+385 and 2209+238) required futher analysis to confirm the presence of very faint\nextended emission. The core component was subtracted from the data, and the residual\nimage was inspected for emission above 3 times the r.m.s. noise level. Extended emission\nwas found for all but two sources, 0642+449 and 2209+238. For these two sources we set\nan upper limit on extended emission equal to three times the r.m.s. noise. In these and all\nthe other sources, we cannot rule out the presence of low\u2212level diffuse emission on larger\nangular scales than the restoring beam, however.\n\n3.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe sources in the MOJAVE sample appear highly core\u2212dominated, since they are\nselected on the basis of compact VLBA emission, and not total (single\u2212dish) flux. Indeed,\nnearly half of the objects we have imaged have less than 50 mJy in extended emission at 1.4\nGHz, and only one source (1222 + 216) has Sext > Score . In Figure 3 we show a histogram of\nthe logarithm of core\u2212to\u2212extended luminosity ratio (Rc ). These values were K\u2212corrected to\nthe rest frame of each AGN using redshifts from the NASA Extragalactic Database assuming\nspectral indices of \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b1 = \u22120.7 (S \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 ) for the core and extended emission\nrespectively. For sources without redshift information, z = 1 was assumed.

(1993), with a broad peak centered at Rc \u2243 10.\n\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have obtained high\u2212dynamic range VLA\u2212A configuration images at 1.4 GHz of\n57 AGN in the MOJAVE sample as part of a project to investigate a possible correlation\nbetween extended jet luminosity of blazars and parsec\u2212scale jet speed. We found extended\nemission above the \u223c0.3 mJy level in all but two sources. A more detailed analysis of the\nfull MOJAVE sample, using arcsecond\u2212scale radio images from previous studies, the VLA\narchive and other observations, will be presented in an upcoming paper.\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the contributions of the other members of the MOJAVE project team: Hugh and Margo Aller, Tigran Arshakian, Steve Bloom, Marshall\nCohen, Dan Homan, Matthias Kadler, Ken Kellermann, Yuri Kovalev, Andrei Lobanov,\nEduardo Ros, Rene Vermeulen, and Tony Zensus.\nThis research was supported by NSF grant 0406923-AST and the Purdue Research Foundation, and made use of the following resources: The NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database\n(NED), which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
