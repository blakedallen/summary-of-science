These are termed voids, although voids may not be completely\nempty, but may harbor a few isolated galaxies. During the 1970's, the use of galaxy redshift\nsurveys to trace the large scale structure began in earnest. Gregory & Thompson (1978)\nshowed evidence for the existence of superclusters and void regions with radii larger than\n20h\u22121 Mpc 1 using pencil beam surveys directed toward the Coma and Perseus cluster.\nEinasto, Joeveer & Saar (1980) discuss the chain-like distribution of galaxies and galaxy\nclusters and the existence of empty cell structures. Kirshner et al. (1981) discovered a void\nin Bo\u00f6tes that is 50h\u22121 Mpc in diameter. The ubiquity of voids and their importance in\n1\n\nwe adopt the convention that H\u25e6 = 100hkm s\u22121 Mpc\u22121\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nthe large scale distribution of galaxies was first clearly shown by results from the Center\nfor Astrophysics surveys (Davis et al. 1992; de Lapparent, Geller, & Huchra 1986; Geller\n& Huchra 1989) and the Southern Sky Redshift survey (da Costa et al. 1988, 1994;\nMaurogordato et al. 1992). Subsequent larger surveys at a variety of wavelengths have\nconfirmed these results and have shown that no larger voids are seen at similar density\ncontrast. See the review article by Rood (1998) and references therein for a discussion of\nthe history of void detection and interpretation.\nVoids appear to have little or no structure within them. Peebles (2001) discusses an\napparent discrepancy between the cold dark matter model and observations. The cold dark\nmatter model predicts that there should be matter and, hence galaxies, primarily dwarfs,\nwithin voids (Dekel & Silk 1986; Hoffman, Silk & Wyse 1992). However, studies of different\ntypes of galaxies show that they all seem to trace the same structures. Grogin & Geller\n(1999, 2000) identify a sample of void galaxies in the CfA2 survey and find evidence for\nenvironmental dependence of galaxy properties, although most of these galaxies in this\nsample avoid the centers of the voids. Surveys of dwarf galaxies indicate that they trace\nthe same overall structures as 'normal' galaxies (Bingelli 1989) and pointed observations\ntoward void regions also fail to detect a significant population of faint galaxies (Kuhn, Hopp\n& Els\u00e4sser 1997; Popescu, Hopp & Els\u00e4sser 1997), consistent with the widely observed\nresult that galaxies have common voids regardless of Hubble type (e.g. Thuan, Gott\n& Schneider 1987; Babul & Postman 1990; Mo, McGaugh & Bothun 1994). Whether\nLyman alpha clouds in voids are associated with galaxy halos or are a distinct population\nremains controversial (Lanzetta et al. 1995; Morris et al. 1993; see Stocke 2001 for further\nreferences). Either we are missing a population of galaxies that reside in the voids or the\nCDM models produce too much clustering of matter on small scales (Bode, Ostriker &\nTurok 2001). The sizes of voids have also been used to place constraints on CDM models.\nBlumenthal et al. (1992) and Piran et al. (1993) find that the frequency and size of voids\ndetected in redshift surveys are difficult to reconcile with CDM models unless the Universe\nis open or that galaxies do not trace mass on very large scales.\nThere are several different algorithms in the literature for detecting voids (see, for\nexample, Kauffmann & Fairall 1991; Kauffmann & Melott 1992; Ryden 1995; Ryden &\nMelott 1996; El-Ad & Piran 1997 (EP97); Aikio & M\u00e4h\u00f6nen 1998) but due to the large\ndiameter of voids (their characteristic diameter is as large as 50 h\u22121 Mpc) and the limited\nvolume of most surveys, relatively few voids have been objectively detected. A search\nfor voids has so far been made using the first slice of the Center for Astrophysics Survey\n(Slezak, de Lapparent & Bijaoui 1993), the Southern Sky Redshift Survey (Pellegrini, da\nCosta & de Carvalho 1989; El-Ad, Piran & da Costa 1996, EPC96), the IRAS 1.2 Jy Survey\n(El-Ad, Piran and da Costa 1997, EPC97), the Las Campanas Survey (M\u00fcller et al. 2000)\nand the PSCz Survey (Plionis & Basilakos 2001). Voids were detected in the CfA slice\nand the Las Campanas Survey, restricted to two-dimensions due to the small declination\nrange of each data set. Eleven voids with >95% significance have been detected in the\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nSSRS2 survey (EPC96), twelve voids with >95% significance have been detected in the\nIRAS 1.2-Jy Survey (EPC97) and fourteen voids with volumes larger than 103 h\u22123 Mpc3\nhave been detected in the PSCz Survey (Plionis & Basilakos 2001). Statistically, voids\nhave also been studied using the Void Probability Function (VPF, White 1979) and the\nUnderdensity Probability (U(R), Vogeley et al. 1989), which depend on the hierarchy of\nn-point correlation functions. The VPF is simply the probability that a randomly selected\nvolume contains no galaxies. The U(R) measures the frequency of regions with density\ncontrast \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 below a threshold. These statistics reveal statistical information about the\nvoid population but do not give details on specific voids.\nA first step in rectifying our relative neglect of voids is to quantitatively characterize\ntheir properties, as defined by surveys at different wavelength. Here we adapt the approach\nof EP97 in order to search for voids in the PSCz Survey (Saunders et al. 2000) and the\nUpdated Zwicky Catalog (UZC, Falco et al. 1999). We describe the surveys in Section 2\nand describe the algorithm in Section 3. We present our results and draw conclusions in\nSection 4 and 5 respectively.\n\n2.\n\nThe Surveys\n\nWe consider two surveys with different wavelength selection to see if the same voids\nare detected and if the properties of voids in overlap regions are similar (see Section 4.2).\nWe consider different samples from the two surveys to check the robustness of results. In\nparticular we are able to check the effect of the wall/field criteria on the detection of voids\n(see Section 4.5) and by how much the volume of voids is restricted by the sample depth\n(see Section 4.6).\n\n2.1.\n\nThe Updated Zwicky Catalog\n\nThe Updated Zwicky Catalog (Falco et al. 1999) includes a re-analysis of data taken\nfrom the Zwicky Catalog and Center for Astrophysics redshift survey to MZwicky <\n\u223c 15.5\n(Zwicky et. al 1961-1968; Geller & Huchra 1989; Huchra et al. 1990; Huchra, Geller &\nCorwin 1995; Huchra, Vogeley & Geller 1998 ) together with new spectroscopic redshifts\nfor some galaxies and coordinates from the digitized POSS-II plates. Improvements over\nthe previous catalogs include estimates of the accuracy of the CfA redshifts and uniformly\naccurate coordinates at the < 2\u2032\u2032 level. The UZC contains a total of 19,369 galaxies. Of the\nobjects with mZwicky <\n\u223c 15.5, 96% have measured redshifts, giving a total number of 18,633\nobjects. The catalog covers two main survey regions; 20h < \u03b11950 < 4h and 8h < \u03b11950 < 17h\nboth with \u22122.5\u25e6 < \u03b41950 < 50\u25e6 .\nWe consider three different samples from the catalog. We construct a volume-limited\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nsample with zmax =0.025 corresponding to a depth of 74h\u22121 Mpc, for an Einstein-de Sitter\ncosmology. The absolute magnitude of each galaxy is estimated to be\nM = mZwicky \u2212 25 \u2212 5log[r(1 + z)] \u2212 3z\n\n(1)\n\nand this sample is limited to Mlim = \u221218.96. Previous analyses of the CfA or UZC samples\nhave removed areas in the South Galactic Cap region with extinction larger than \u2206m >\n\u223c 0.3.\nWe do not apply this cut as it severely restricts the volume of the survey. Instead, we\ncompare the voids we find in the UZC with those we find in PSCz to examine if the paucity\nof galaxies in these regions of the catalog causes us to falsely detect voids.\nThis volume-limited sample contains 3518 galaxies, which is the largest number of\ngalaxies in a volume limited sample that can be constructed from the catalog. Application\nof the wall/field criteria (defined in Section 3.2) to this sample yields 3240 wall galaxies\nand 278 field galaxies. We also consider the same volume limited sample without applying\nthe wall/field criteria to see how the voids are affected when we insist they are completely\nempty. We also consider a sample that extends an extra 20h\u22121 Mpc in depth to estimate the\nimpact of the survey boundary on the estimated sizes of voids.\n\n2.2.\n\nThe PSCz Survey\n\nObjects in the PSCz Survey were selected from the IRAS Point Source Catalog\n(Beichman et al. 1984) which is a catalog of detections down to a flux limit of 0.6 Jy\ntaken with the IRAS (Infra-Red Astronomical Satellite). Targets for the PSCz survey were\nchosen to maximise the sky coverage but at the same time other considerations such as\ncompleteness, flux uniformity, having a well defined sample area and redshift range were\ntaken into account. (See Saunders et al. 2000 and references therein for a more complete\ndescription of target selection criteria.)\nThe PSCz survey covers 84% of the sky. Areas with incomplete IRAS data and high\noptical extinction, such as the plane of the Galaxy, are not included in the Survey. The\nPSCz survey contains 15,411 galaxies. Of order 8,000 objects had known redshifts in the\nliterature (Saunders et al. 2000). Follow-up observations were carried out to obtain the\nremaining redshifts. The median redshift of the survey is 0.028 corresponding to a comoving\ndepth of \u223c 80h\u22121 Mpc assuming an EdS cosmology.\nIn a flux limited sample the number density of detectable objects decreases with\ndistance. Thus, we are more likely to detect voids towards the edge of the survey because\nthe average galaxy-galaxy separation increases. Therefore we restrict the depth of the\nsample to the median redshift, 0.028, which closely matches the depth of the UZC sample.\nAs IR selected surveys are sparse compared to optically selected surveys, we keep all the\ngalaxies in the sample, i.e. we do not construct a true volume-limited catalog. We find\nthat void properties do not vary with depth over the range we consider, thus the void\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nfinding algorithm is robust with respect to small changes in the selection function. The\naverage density of objects in this PSCz sample is comparable to the density of objects in\nthe volume-limited UZC sample if we do not apply the volume limited criteria to PSCz.\nThis allows us to compare voids found in the two surveys at similar sampling density.\nAs for the UZC, we consider this sample in two ways, one where we we apply the\nwall/field galaxy criteria (defined in Section 3.2) and one where we do not (and so all\ngalaxies are wall galaxies). This sample contains 8425 galaxies (7743 wall galaxies and 682\nfield galaxies) A third sample is constructed in which we extend the sample by 20h\u22121 Mpc.\nAgain, this is to examine by how much we underestimate the volume of voids when we\nimpose our cut in depth.\n\n3.\n\nThe Void Finding Algorithm\n3.1.\n\nOutline\n\nHere we outline the steps involved in our void finding algorithm. Each of the steps are\ndiscussed in detail in the subsequent sections. The void finding algorithm we adopt is very\nsimilar to the method used by El-Ad & Piran (Void Finder EP97, EPC97).\nTests with toy model distributions and results of N-body simulations indicate that this\nalgorithm is robust in locating voids and measuring their sizes. The method allows for \"field\ngalaxies\" in the voids, which are removed before void detection. This step ensures that void\ndetection is not dominated by shot noise of the few galaxies in these large underdensities.\nSetting a minimum void size prevent voids from percolating through small gaps in the\ndense wall-like or filamentary structures. This minimum void size is also set so that the\nvoids are statistically significant in comparison with randomly occurring holes in a Poisson\ndistribution with the same average density of objects. As long as the sampling density\nis high enough that the overdense structure are well-defined (no gaps comparable to or\nlarger than the minimum void threshold), then void detection is not highly sensitive to the\nsampling density.\nThe steps of the void finding algorithm are as follows:\n\u2022 Classification of galaxies as wall or field galaxies, Section 3.2\n\u2022 Detecting empty cells in the distribution of wall galaxies, Section 3.3\n\u2022 Growth of the maximal empty spheres, Section 3.4\n\u2022 Classification of the unique voids, Section 3.5\n\u2022 Enhancement of the void volume, Section 3.6\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n3.2.\n\nWall and Field Galaxies\n\nThe first stage in identifying voids is to determine which galaxies are classed as field\ngalaxies and which are wall galaxies. Here we follow the method of EP97. First we calculate\nthe mean distance, d, to the nth galaxy and the standard deviation on this value, \u03c3. We\nthen specify a length ln such that any galaxy that does not have n neighbours within a\nsphere of radius ln is classified as a field galaxy. The value of ln we adopt is given by ln =\nd + 1.5\u03c3 and we set n=3. For our main samples, the values of d and l3 that we obtain\nfor the PSCz survey are 3.42h\u22121 Mpc and 7.19h\u22121 Mpc respectively while for the UZC we\nobtain 3.46h\u22121 and 6.52h\u22121 Mpc. This choice of sphere size means that field galaxies are\nfound in regions with density contrast, \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1, of less than -0.5. For n=3 \u223c10% of galaxies\nare classified as field galaxies in both surveys. If n=0 then all the galaxies are field galaxies\nand the survey is just one large void (or two because of the disjoint geometry of both the\nPSCz and UZC). If n is higher than 3, then the proportion of galaxies classified as field\ngalaxies drops rapidly. We compare results for our main sample to an analysis of a sample\nwhere all the galaxies are classed as wall galaxies to see what effect the exclusion of field\ngalaxies has on the voids we detect.\nWe also have to consider what effect the edges of the survey have on our wall/field\ncriteria. Galaxies close to the edges may appear isolated and be classified as field galaxies\nbut they may be part of large groups just outside the geometry of the sample under\nconsideration. This could lead to a slight overestimation of the size of the voids near the\nsurvey boundary because a maximal sphere in the vicinity of an erroneously classified edge\ngalaxy can be grown to the survey boundary rather than being bounded by that galaxy. As\nthese wrongly classified field galaxies are only those close to the survey edge, the maximal\nspheres cannot be grown much larger and hence the void sizes should not be overestimated\nby a large amount. There is no indication that voids near the boundaries are larger than\nthose interior to the surveys.\nSimilarly, we may overestimate the values of \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 for voids that lie close to the edges\nas the wrongly classified field galaxies may lie within a void. However, on inspection, few of\nthese galaxies actually lie in voids due to the spherical nature of voids and the proximity of\nthe survey boundary.\n\n3.3.\n\nDetecting the Empty Cells\n\nThe next step is to place the galaxies (either all the galaxies or just the wall galaxies\nwhen we apply the wall/field criteria) onto a three dimensional grid and count the number\nof galaxies in each cell. Cells that lie at a greater distance than the maximum radius of the\nsample under consideration are not considered further. The fineness of the grid defines the\nminimum size void that can be detected. If each grid cell has length lcell , then voids with\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\n80\n\n80\n\n80\n\n70\n\n70\n\n70\n\n60\n\n60\n\n60\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n40\n\n40\n\n40\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nFig. 1.- The void finder technique. The method is discussed in more detail in the text. Step\n1, we identify an empty cell within a void. From that cell we find the nearest wall galaxy\nand grow the sphere to that radius. Step 2, we move away from the first galaxy, growing\nthe sphere until the second galaxy is on the surface. Step 3, we connect the sphere center\nto the point which bisects the two detected galaxies and move the center along this vector\nuntil a third galaxy is on the radius. In 2D this is where we stop. In 3D, the final stage\nis to move the sphere center out of the plane defined by the first three galaxies. The open\nsquares in the diagrams are previous void centers and earlier detected galaxies. The solid\nsquares show the current void center and the galaxy detected at each stage. The points in\nthis two dimensional example are randomly generated in a box with a circular area carved\nout as a demonstration of the technique.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nradius r =\n\n\u221a\n\n3lcell will be found. We fix lcell to be the same as l3 .\n\n3.4.\n\nGrowth of the Maximal Spheres\n\nEach empty grid cell (we will refer to these as holes) is considered to be part of a\npossible void. Our method finds the maximal sphere that can be drawn in the void, starting\nfrom the empty cell, and is shown schematically in Figure 1. From the center of the empty\ncell, we grow a sphere, increasing its radius until we find a galaxy that is just on the edge of\nit. We then find the vector that connects this galaxy with the center of the hole and move\nthe center of the spherical hole along this direction, away from the first galaxy, growing the\nradius to keep the first galaxy on its surface, until a second galaxy is also on the surface.\nWe next find the vector that bisects the line joining the two galaxies and move the hole in\nthis direction until a third galaxy is found, as before. If voids are being detected in two\ndimensional data, the process stops here. However, we are considering three dimensional\ndata so the final step is to grow the hole out of the plane formed by the first three galaxies.\nWe insist that our voids lie completely in the survey i.e. they are contained within the\nvolume specified by our survey boundaries and sample depth. At this stage we keep track\nof all the holes with radii larger than the value of the search radius used to classify field and\nwall galaxies, l3 .\nOur method is somewhat redundant. We specify the minimum size of our holes that\nform voids but many voids are far larger than this and more than one empty cell may lie\nwithin the void region, thus we grow some voids more than once. However, it does guarantee\nthat we find all the holes that can contribute to the voids volume so the redundancy is\neliminated when we calculate the volume of the voids (see Section 3.6).\n\n3.5.\n\nClassification of Unique Voids\n\nFinding the holes is a robust process. Deciding which of those holes are unique voids\nrequires more care. Our definition of a void is slightly different from that of EP97. First we\nsort the holes by radius, the largest first. The largest hole found is automatically a void.\nWe define a fractional overlap parameter, \u03b71 . If the second void overlaps the first by more\nthan \u03b71 in volume, then we say it is a member of the first void rather than a new void. If\nnot then it forms a separate void. We then check the third hole to see if it overlaps either of\nthe previous voids by \u03b71 in volume. If it does, we add it to that void; if not, we form a new\nvoid. If it overlaps two voids by more than \u03b71 then we reject the hole as it links two larger,\nindependent voids. We continue like this for all holes with radii larger than 10h\u22121 Mpc.\nWe have investigated how much holes should overlap and yet be considered separate\nvoids. If the overlap threshold is high, say \u03b71 =90%, then most of the holes are considered\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nunique voids and the same empty region may be contained in more than one void. If the\noverlap fraction is too low, then voids that barely overlap are considered two parts of the\nsame void. This means that if there are any small gaps in the walls, two spheres could be\njoined together to form a single void which, under visual inspection, obviously consists of\ntwo voids.\nIn figure 2 we show the number of voids we find for the PSCz (dashed line) and the\nUZC (solid line) as we vary the percentage overlap. The values seem to flatten off for\n\u03b71 <30%. We fix the value of \u03b71 to be 10%. Visually, using our criteria of \u03b71 =10%, voids\nappear to be distinct regions of the survey. For a void with a radius of 10h\u22121 Mpc and with\nan overlap region of \u03b71 =10%, gaps in the walls would have to be larger than 9h\u22121 Mpc,\nwhich is larger than the wall/field galaxy criteria and larger than the average galaxy-galaxy\nseparation in both surveys. Gaps of this size in the walls are rare so distinct voids are not\nconnected. Therefore, if a hole with radii larger than 10h\u22121 Mpc overlaps a larger void by\nmore than 10% of its volume, we merge the hole into that void. If \u03b71 is less than 10% of the\nsmaller void's volume, we deem the sphere to be a distinct void and if the hole overlaps two\nlarger voids by 10% we reject it.\nWe set a threshold of 10h\u22121 Mpc for the minimum size of voids. This threshold is larger\nthan the search radius for defining field galaxies, l3 . This helps ensure that we do not\nidentify gaps in the walls as voids. It is also the value at which the significance of detecting\nvoids in the both the PSCz and UZC catalog drops below 95%, discussed in Section 4.1.\n\n3.6.\n\nEnhancement of the Void's Volume\n\nWe next enhance the volume of each void. We consider the holes that have radii\nless than the threshold of 10h\u22121 Mpc but greater than the radius for the wall/field galaxy\ncriterion, l3 , (in the case where we do not make the wall/field galaxy cut we still use l3 as\nthe minimum sphere radius). Any hole that overlaps the maximal void sphere (as grown in\nSection 3.4) by \u03b72 >50% of the smaller hole's volume is also considered part of the larger\nvoid. If the hole overlaps with more than one void then it is not added to either of the\nvoids as this would link two voids together that we wish to keep separate. If the hole is\nisolated it cannot be classed as a separate void as it is smaller than the threshold we use\nfor void classification. The choice of \u03b72 =50% is somewhat arbitrary but it fills the void\nvolume without changing the overall spherical shape of the voids. We have compared the\nvolumes of voids found using different values of \u03b72 . For values of \u03b72 in the range 20-70%,\nthe volumes of voids are robust to within 20%.\nWe compute the volume of each void by Monte Carlo integration, i.e. we embed it in\na box that is larger than the void and generate many random particles within the box and\ncount how many lie within one of the holes that make up the void. The ratio of the number\nof randoms in the void to the total number of randoms placed in the box multiplied by\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nthe volume of the box gives an estimate of the volume of the void. We could, in principle,\ncalculate the volume of the void analytically as it is just formed by a series of overlapping\nspheres. However, if a void consists of more that three overlapping holes, the solution is\nrather complicated.\nWe are likely to underestimate the volumes of voids as we only consider holes that\nhave radius greater than the search radius, l3 . If voids are highly elliptical then we will not\ndetect the volume at the 'corners' of the ellipse. We test this by generating data containing\nmock voids of known elliptical shape. We take the average volume of a void, taken to be\n15,000h\u22123Mpc3 , and generate ellipsoids with this volume that have axis ratios 1:1:X (i.e.\nif X is 1 then the void is spherical with radius 15.3h\u22121 Mpc). We then run the simulated\ndata through our void finding algorithm and compare the volume obtained with the known\nvolume of the void. The results are shown in Figure 3. If voids are spherical in shape then\nwe recover 100% of its volume. The more elongated it becomes, the less of the volume we\ndetect. This becomes significant if one of the axes is elongated by more than a factor of 2.5\nthan the others. If the axis are in the ratio 1:1.5:2 then we can recover 90% of the volume\nand if they are in the ratio 1:2:3 we can recover 70% of the volume. As voids are seen to be\nroughly spherical in nature we should be able to detect most of a void's volume.\nFinally in the case where we specify wall and field galaxies, we count the number of\nfield galaxies that lie in each void to determine the underdensity of the void.\n\n4.\n\nResults\n\nVoids in the main PSCz and UZC sample are shown in Figure 4 (PSCz) and 5 (UZC).\nIn both cases, the points represent the wall galaxies and the shadings represent areas that\nare covered by voids. Squares indicate the three dimensional center of each void. Projecting\n3-D data onto a 2-D page makes the voids appear to contain galaxies but in reality voids\nare free from wall galaxies (but may contain field galaxies which are not shown). We find 35\nvoids with r> 10h\u22121 Mpc in the PSCz survey and 19 voids with r> 10h\u22121 Mpc in the UZC.\n\n4.1.\n\nSignificance of the Voids\n\nWe use the method of EPC97 to assess the significance of voids. The confidence level\nwith which we detect a void is given by\np(r) = 1 \u2212\n\nNPoisson (r)\nNSurvey (r)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere NSurvey (r) is the number of voids in the sample under consideration and NPoisson\nis the number of voids found in Poisson realisations of the sample. These have the same\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- The number of voids in each survey as a function of overlap fraction, \u03b71 , allowed\nbetween distinct voids (dashed line PSCz, solid line UZC). If spheres are allowed to almost\ncompletely overlap and still be classified as individual voids, then we detect too many voids\nin each survey. We adopt a value of \u03b71 =10%.\n\nFig. 3.- The accuracy to which we recover the volume of an ellipsoid with axis ratios\n1:1:X. If the void is spherical then we recover 100% of the volume of the sphere. The more\nelongated the void, the smaller the fraction of the volume we recover when requiring that\nthe maximum sphere size be larger than the wall/field criteria, l3 . We only show the results\nfor ellipses with two axes equal and the third different as this is the worst case scenario. If\nthe axis are in the ratio 1:1.5:2 we recover 90% of the volume and if they are in the ratio\n1:2:3 we recover 70% of the volume.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Voids in the PSCz Survey. We show the supergalactic coordinates (X,Y) for different values of Z. Each panel shows a 10h\u22121 Mpc slice starting at -45h\u22121 Mpc<Z<-35h\u22121Mpc\ntop left to 35h\u22121 Mpc<Z<45h\u22121 Mpc bottom right. The shaded regions are the voids. The\nfilled points are the wall galaxies and the open squares show the void centers (as the voids\nhave radii > 10h\u22121 Mpc they spread over more than one panel and thus some shaded areas\ndo not contain a void center). No wall galaxies are found in the voids. Field galaxies are not\nshown.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- Voids in the UZC Survey. We show the supergalactic coordinates (X,Y) for different\nvalues of Z. Each panel shows a 10h\u22121 Mpc slice starting at -45h\u22121Mpc<Z<-35h\u22121 Mpc top\nleft to 35h\u22121 Mpc<Z<45h\u22121 Mpc bottom right. The shaded regions are the voids. The filled\npoints are the wall galaxies and the open squares show the void centers (as the voids have\nradii > 10h\u22121 Mpc they spread over more than one panel and thus some shaded areas do\nnot contain a void center). No wall galaxies are found in the voids. Field galaxies are not\nshown.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nnumber density of points and the same radial and angular selection functions of the sample\nbut the points are unclustered. The closer p(r) is to 1, the less likely a void could occur in\na random distribution.\nWith a threshold of 10h\u22121 Mpc for the void radius, we find an average of 1.9 voids in\nthe mock PSCz realisations and an average of 1.1 voids in the UZC realisations. Thus the\nvoids we detect in both the PSCz and UZC with radius >10h\u22121 Mpc are significant at the\n95% confidence level, which is why we set this minimum size threshold.\n\n4.2.\n\nSizes of the Voids\n\nThe largest hole in the PSCz survey has a diameter of 35.7h\u22121 Mpc, whereas in the\nUZC survey the largest hole has a diameter of 29.3h\u22121 Mpc. The wider angle covered by\nthe PSCz survey allows somewhat larger voids to be detected. The average void in the\nPSCz survey has a maximal sphere diameter of 24.8\u00b13.3h\u22121 Mpc and an effective diameter\nof 29.8\u00b13.5h\u22121 Mpc (we find the effective diameter by calculating the diameter of a sphere\nthat would match the volume of the void) whereas the average void in the UZC survey has\na slightly smaller maximal sphere diameter of 23.6\u00b12.7h\u22121 Mpc and an effective diameter of\n29.2\u00b12.9h\u22121 Mpc. The average void size obviously depends on the minimum size threshold\nof r>10h\u22121 Mpc. Raising or lowering this threshold raises or lowers the average void size.\nThe maximal spheres typically fill 60% of the void's volume, found by dividing the volume\nof the void by the volume of the maximal sphere. There does not appear to be any trend\nwith void size in this filling fraction.\nWe compare the voids detected in both the PSCz and the UZC. We are able to match\n15 out of the 19 voids in the UZC to voids in the PSCz. Two (10 and 16 in the UZC list)\nof the voids detected in the UZC form one void in the PSCz survey. Void 19 appears to\nbe a case where the maximal sphere in the PSCz survey lies just below the threshold of\n10h\u22121 Mpc and so is not classed as a void in the PSCz. Voids 12 and 18 (marked with an\nasterisk in table 2) are found in areas with high extinction in the South Galactic Cap.\nThere are few galaxies detected in the UZC in these regions so voids can be grown. As\nextinction is less of a problem in the IR, relatively more galaxies are detected in the PSCz\nsample and voids are not detected. Thus, these particular voids are suspect and we exclude\nthem from calculation of the statistical properties of voids.\nFor the 15 voids that we do detect in both of the surveys, the diameter of the maximal\nspheres and the volumes we detect are very similar. In figure 6 we divide the diameters and\nvolumes of the voids detected in the PSCz by the same values found from the UZC and find\nvalues fairly close to 1.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n4.3.\n\nDensity of Voids\n\nIn the case where we differentiate between wall and field galaxies, we can determine\nthe density contrast of voids. We find that voids have a typical density contrast of \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 =\n-0.92\u00b10.03 in the case of the PSCz survey and -0.96\u00b10.01 in the case of the UZC survey.\nThese values are very low; even with 10% of galaxies classed as field galaxies the field\ngalaxies probably lie close to the structures traced by the wall galaxies and therefore are not\ndetected within the void volume. Again, there is no trend seen between the underdensity\nand size of voids; the largest voids and the smallest voids all have consistent values of \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1.\nThe total volume fraction occupied by voids in the PSCz and UZC surveys is 30% and\n40% respectively. Compared to previous estimates, this value is low. De Lapparent, Huchra\n& Geller (1991) find that high density regions only fill 25% of the Center for Astrophysics\nslices, leaving up to 75% to be filled by lower density regions. The voids we detect are\nextremely low density voids, hence they fill a smaller fraction of the survey.\n\n4.4.\n\nComparison with other papers\n\nWe can compare results with voids detected by EPC97 in the 1.2 Jy Survey. The 1.2\nJy survey covers the same area as the PSCz survey but is sparser due to the higher flux\nlimit. Consequently, fewer voids are found to the same significance level. 12 voids with\n> 95% significance are found and these have an average diameter of 40h\u22121 Mpc. This is\nsignificantly larger that the voids we detect in the PSCz but voids must have a diameter\nlarger than 25h\u22121 Mpc to be 95% significant, thus the smaller voids are not reported by\nEPC97. In most cases, we detect the same regions as voids as EPC97. We class void 7 in\nEPC97 as two separate voids because our sample includes fainter galaxies that restrict the\ngrowth of the maximal spheres. There are also two voids that EPC97 report as significant\nat the 80% level that we do not detect in the PSCz sample (voids 14 and 15 in EPC97).\nA recent paper by Plionis & Basilakos (2001) examines voids in the PSCz survey. Voids\nare found by these authors using a smoothed apparent magnitude limited sample rather\nthan the point distribution of galaxies and the paper concentrates on measuring the shapes\nof voids and making a comparison to various cosmological models. Plionis & Basilakos find\n14 voids out to 80h\u22121 Mpc with volumes larger than 103 h\u22123 Mpc; we find 23 such voids. 9\nof the voids are detected using both methods. The remaining 5 voids lie at distances such\nthat a void with a radius of > 10h\u22121 Mpc would not fit fully in the survey geometry. The 14\nvoids that we detect but which Plionis & Basilakos do not detect appear to be surrounded\nby high density regions. The smoothing technique appears to smooth the galaxies into the\nvoids, restricting the number of voids that can be detected.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n4.5.\n\nNo Field Galaxies\n\nWhat happens if we do not remove field galaxies from the samples? In either the PSCz\nor the UZC Survey, we find that 90% of the same voids are detected whether or not we\nmake the wall/field galaxy cut. As expected, we miss a couple of the voids when we do not\nclassify galaxies in low density regions as field galaxies as they interrupt the growth of the\nmaximal spheres, thus the spheres lie below the detection threshold of 10h\u22121 Mpc and the\nvoids are not detected.\nAs the voids we detect when we make the wall/field galaxy cut are so empty (\u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 =\n-0.92, -0.96), it is not surprising that there is relatively little difference between the voids\ndetected with and without applying the wall/field galaxy criteria.\n\n4.6.\n\nEdge Effects\n\nWe also compare the volumes of the voids found in our main sample with voids found\nin samples that extend 20h\u22121 Mpc in depth beyond the depth of our main samples. We\ncompare the volumes of voids and diameters of maximal spheres in the center (PSCz) and\nright hand (UZC) plots in figure 6. This plot shows that in general we underestimate the\nvolume of voids by a larger factor at larger distance. This is not unexpected as it is only\nvoids found at large depth that should be affected by the survey depth limit. However, the\ndiameter of the maximal spheres are in reasonable agreement and the diameters are found\nto be the same to within 20%.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have developed and tested a void finding algorithm, similar to that of EP97, and\napplied it to the PSCz and UZC surveys. Our method differs slightly from that of EP97 in\nthe criteria that we use to identify unique voids; there is no obvious definition of how to\ngroup holes into voids. We demonstrate that our technique gives robust results in the sense\nthat different samples from the same survey yield the same voids and we detect similar\nvoids from redshift surveys with different wavelength selection. As an extension to the work\nof EP97 and EPC97 we quantify the effect of our void definition on the number of voids\ndetected within a survey and we provide estimates of how accurately we are able to recover\nthe volume of voids. We determine that the diameters of the voids presented here are\nprobably accurate to within 20%. Detecting voids with relative densities of \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 = \u22120.92,\nwe find that up to 40% of the volume in the surveys under consideration is found in void\nregions. This is consistent with the findings of EPC97 and shows that voids are indeed a\nlarge part of the universe.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nD(Max-Sphere)\n(h\u22121 Mpc)\n35.68\n31.34\n31.00\n30.02\n28.52\n27.29\n27.27\n27.22\n26.88\n26.83\n26.59\n26.41\n26.08\n25.88\n25.73\n24.44\n24.10\n24.03\n23.78\n23.68\n23.53\n23.38\n23.22\n22.90\n22.82\n22.54\n22.47\n22.14\n21.09\n20.97\n20.95\n20.66\n20.50\n20.38\n20.21\n\nD(Equiv)\n(h\u22121 Mpc)\n44.45\n37.12\n39.99\n31.28\n33.55\n31.87\n32.86\n32.28\n28.85\n36.78\n35.66\n34.71\n32.09\n30.16\n29.27\n31.89\n31.15\n31.27\n30.58\n32.14\n25.72\n26.02\n26.70\n26.02\n27.82\n24.24\n27.01\n26.66\n24.57\n20.83\n26.36\n27.51\n23.26\n22.60\n21.26\n\nVolume\n(h\u22123 Mpc3 )\n45992.1\n26789.5\n33496.0\n16018.4\n19773.2\n16955.0\n18585.3\n17606.6\n12572.5\n26053.0\n23749.8\n21891.0\n17301.4\n14357.5\n13129.7\n16980.8\n15821.7\n16012.0\n14976.6\n17384.9\n8905.3\n9224.0\n9965.7\n9223.6\n11273.7\n7462.0\n10322.9\n9923.2\n7764.9\n4731.8\n9594.2\n10899.4\n6586.8\n6047.6\n5034.4\n\nDistance\n(h\u22121 Mpc)\n56.34\n59.31\n54.44\n57.57\n59.22\n52.01\n58.63\n56.80\n59.52\n49.03\n41.18\n55.46\n59.26\n58.90\n59.55\n53.96\n43.60\n49.65\n53.82\n52.11\n59.24\n54.02\n58.41\n59.03\n38.63\n33.63\n56.80\n58.08\n43.66\n56.08\n56.45\n42.51\n59.68\n46.97\n58.53\n\n\u03b1\ndegrees\n355.0\n97.8\n224.9\n246.9\n242.4\n256.8\n334.3\n61.1\n149.1\n351.9\n34.0\n206.9\n164.1\n209.4\n210.4\n170.3\n310.6\n159.7\n192.8\n49.3\n316.0\n85.1\n51.5\n285.5\n263.4\n250.3\n317.2\n124.2\n102.5\n311.6\n223.1\n332.4\n27.5\n91.5\n58.1\n\n\u03b4\ndegrees\n-47.7\n-50.5\n-2.0\n-19.6\n33.9\n0.9\n4.8\n-27.6\n56.6\n-21.1\n-55.2\n71.9\n-29.3\n-42.9\n52.8\n34.5\n-29.4\n5.3\n15.9\n15.0\n-74.1\n-6.1\n-46.0\n47.1\n43.6\n-5.6\n-15.7\n6.8\n48.6\n73.4\n31.7\n15.9\n21.4\n-22.2\n-84.8\n\n\u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1\n-0.91\n-0.94\n-0.92\n-0.96\n-0.96\n-0.95\n-0.94\n-0.92\n-0.90\n-0.94\n-0.99\n-0.95\n-0.94\n-0.93\n-0.97\n-0.92\n-0.96\n-0.95\n-0.91\n-0.90\n-0.95\n-0.95\n-0.91\n-0.88\n-0.96\n-0.94\n-0.96\n-0.96\n-0.97\n-0.86\n-0.93\n-1.00\n-1.00\n-1.00\n-0.96\n\nMax-Sphere\nFraction\n0.52\n0.60\n0.47\n0.88\n0.61\n0.63\n0.57\n0.60\n0.81\n0.39\n0.41\n0.44\n0.54\n0.63\n0.68\n0.45\n0.46\n0.45\n0.47\n0.40\n0.76\n0.73\n0.66\n0.68\n0.55\n0.80\n0.57\n0.57\n0.63\n1.02\n0.50\n0.42\n0.69\n0.73\n0.86\n\nTable 1: The voids in the PSCz survey, with a distance cut of r < 80h\u22121 Mpc, where field\ngalaxies are differentiated from wall galaxies.

We give (reading left to right) the diameter of the\nmaximal sphere detected in the void, the equivalent diameter assuming the volume of the\nvoid is spherical, the volume of the void, the location of the void in distance, \u03b1 and \u03b4\ncoordinates assuming an Einstein-de Sitter Universe, the density contrast of voids and the\nratio of the volume of the largest hole to the total void volume. The two voids marked with\nan asterisk are discussed in the text.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nThe next generation of surveys, the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (Colless et al. 2001\nand references therein) and, in particular, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (York et al. 2000\nand references therein) will aid our understanding of voids. Both of these surveys cover\na larger sky area than the UZC, although not quite as large an area as the IR surveys.\nThe SDSS will cover a quarter of the sky in one contiguous area which will be especially\nuseful for void detection. Both the 2dFGRS and the SDSS will reach fainter magnitude\nlimits than previous surveys, approximately 4 magnitudes deeper than the UZC. This\nwill allow us to construct volume limited samples with more galaxies, which extend to\ngreater depths. Perhaps more importantly, the multiband digital photometry, as well as\nthe deep spectroscopy, of the SDSS will also allow us to study the properties of the field\ngalaxies in detail. We will have a large enough sample of galaxies found in low density\nenvironments to statistically check if they have different properties than the galaxies found\nin the wall regions, allowing the role of environment on galaxy properties and formation to\nbe examined.\nMSV acknowledges support from NSF grant AST-0071201 and the John Templeton\nFoundation.

The radii of the\nvoids detected in the two surveys agree to with in 20%, indicating that sample selection plays\nlittle effect on the diameters of voids. The center and right hand plot give an indication of\nthe amount we underestimate the radii of the maximal spheres (triangles) and the volumes\n(circles) of voids by insisting they lie entirely in the volume of the survey as a function of\ndepth for the PSCz survey (center plot) and the UZC (right hand plot). Voids that lie closer\nto the depth boundary naturally suffer more from underestimation problems but even so, we\nestimate the radii are accurate to within 30%.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nAikio, J., & M\u00e4h\u00f6nen, P. 1998, ApJ, 497, 534\nBabul, A., & Postman, M., 1990, ApJ, 359, 280\nBeichman, C.A., et al. 1998, IRAS Catalogs and Atlases, Vol 1: Explanatory Supplement\n(JPL)\nBingelli, B., 1989, in Large-Scale Structure and Motions in the Universe, ed.
