(2002, in the following referred to as GWW) photometric data for the double quasar HE 1104-1805 was used to get a new and improved estimate for the time delay of the system. The authors claim that the previous value obtained for the delay\n(\u22120.73 years, Wisotzki et al. 1998) was affected by bias\nof the employed dispersion minimization method (Pelt et\nal. 1994, 1996). To substantiate their claim they introduce\na notion of consistency to evaluate different delay estimation schemes.\nWhen the bias (and methods to control it) of the dispersion minimization algorithm is well known, its possible internal inconsistency is certainly a new aspect of the\nmethod and should be seriously considered. In this short\nnote we just do that. First we shortly review the problem\nof the bias introduced by the method and then turn to\nthe problem of inconsistency. We will show that this notion as defined in GWW comes from a shaky argument\nand should not be used. This is true in the context of the\ndispersion minimization method as well as in the context\nof other methods.\nIn the final part of the paper we will show that the\ncurrently available data for HE 1104-1805 is not sufficient\nto determine a time delay with a resonable precision (with\na standard deviation of, say, \u2264 15%).\n2. Bias in the dispersion minimization method\nIn the dispersion minimization method (Pelt et al. 1994,\n1996) one evaluates cross sums of the type:\nPN \u22121 PN\nWn,m (\u03c4 )(Cn \u2212 Cm )2\n2\nD (\u03c4 ) = n=1 Pm=n+1\n,\nP\nN \u22121\nN\nn=1\nm=n+1 Wn,m\nwhere Cn and Cm are points of the combined lightcurve\nand the weights Wn,m (\u03c4 ) depend on the trial time delay \u03c4 ,\nestimated errors and a particular downweighting scheme\nS(tn \u2212tm ) (for details see Pelt et al. 1994, 1996 or GWW).\nBias is introduced into the method by the fact that magnitude differences Cn \u2212 Cm = qn + \u01ebn \u2212 qm \u2212 \u01ebm depend\nSend offprint requests to: J.Pelt, e-mail: pelt@aai.ee\n\nnot only on observational errors \u01ebn , \u01ebm but also on the\nintrinsic variability of the quasar through qn \u2212 qm . The\nbasic presumption of the method is that this variability is\nrelatively low for nearby time points which have non-zero\nweights in the above sum. Bias in the method is somewhat\ncontrolled by the choice of the parameter \u03b4 in a particular\ndownweighting\u001ascheme\nm|\n1 \u2212 |tn \u2212t\nif |tn \u2212 tm | \u2264 \u03b4\n\u03b4\nS(tn \u2212 tm ) =\n0\nif |tn \u2212 tm | > \u03b4,\nwhich gives a higher weight for nearby pairs and lower\nweight for pairs whose components are far away from each\nother. Pairs with |tn \u2212 tm | > \u03b4 are excluded. To use the\ndispersion method consistently we need to compute dispersion spectra for a large sample of downweighting parameter \u03b4 values. If there are enough points in the data\nset to compute statistically stable dispersions and they\nare favorably spaced (without long regularly spaced gaps)\nthen the best delay shows up in a multitude of spectra.\nThe scatter of the obtained minima can be used to get a\nrough estimate of the bias involved. We refer the reader\nto Pelt et al. (1996) for a detailed analysis of the bias in\nthe dispersion minimization method as used in the case of\nthe double quasar QSO 0957+561.\nFor the analysis below we note that dispersion minimization can be looked upon as a certain election scheme.\nThe pool of electors (or voters) is a set of all data point\npairs (Cn , Cm ) in a combined curve (A\u2013curve together\nwith the time and magnitude shifted B\u2013curve). We assume here that the Cn and Cm always originate from different original curves (one from A and the other from B).\nFor a fixed trial time delay \u03c4trial and a magnitude shift\noptimized for this value, every pair gives a vote of a certain strength. The vote is zero when |tn \u2212 tm | > \u03b4 for a\ncertain pair. Let us call such electors irrelevant for a particular time delay. The strength of the other electors' vote\ndepend on the magnitude difference Cn \u2212 Cm and on the\nweight applied. If, for instance, there is a pair (elector)\nwhose time difference for a time delay \u03c4trial is quite small,\nand whose squared magnitude difference is high, then this\nelector gives a very strong vote against \u03c4trial . The trial\ntime delay which gathers the smallest amount of against\n\n\fJ. Pelt: Double quasar HE 1104-1805 time delay\n\nvotes is the winner. The dispersion spectrum is just a voting protocol for the row of trial time delays.\nR\n\n3. Consistency of the time delay estimation\nmethods\nThe notion of consistency for time delay estimation\nschemes was introduced in GWW. It differs from that usually used in mathematical statistics, so we need to give\nsome details. Using the metaphore of elections introduced\nabove, the basic idea behind their \"consistency\" can be\nexplained as follows. Let us first compute the dispersion\nspectrum. Assume that it attained a global minimum at\ntime delay \u03c41 . We can look now at our voters. For this\nparticular delay a certain subset of voters is irrelevant\n(set of zero weight voters). And some of the original data\npoints take part only in zero votes. We remove these irrelevant points from the data set and recompute the spectrum\n(second tour of the elections). If the new spectrum has a\nstrongest minimum for a significantly different delay (say\n\u03c42 ) then the full estimation scheme is inconsistent according to GWW (Sec. 3.2).\nLet us now return to the first tour of our elections.\nSome of the electors voted against delay \u03c41 and some others against delay \u03c42 . On average, the first time delay received a smaller number of \"against\" votes and therefore it\nwon the race. Now, if we throw away the irrelevant points\nand corresponding voters for the delay \u03c41 then we often\nthrow away some of the against votes for \u03c42 . It is not a\nmiracle then that the second delay can win at the second\ntour! There are not any internal logical or statistical inconsistencies involved. The important point here is that\nthe best candidate for the true time delay is found by\ncomparing dispersions for different \u03c4 -s and these dispersions depend on different subsets of data point pairs. Even\nwhen a particular pair is not numerically accounted for to\ncompute the dispersion at \u03c41 , it can take part in forming\nthe dispersion for another delay \u03c42 and thus can determine\nwhich of the delays will be the best estimate.\nWhat is the probability that the consistency argument\nleads to a wrong conclusion? A comprehensive analysis of\nthis question is out of the scope for this paper. However, a\nsimple numerical experiment shows that we are not dealing with a rare event. Using the HE 1104\u20131805 data set\nwe constructed an artificial \"source curve\" and generated\nfrom it 1000 new data sets as in normal bootstrap calculations. The only difference was that we did not use full\namplitude bootstrap errors but scaled them by an error\nlevel parameter R. In Table 1 we present the results of\nsuch experiments with different parameters R, \u03b4 and \u03c4\nwhich model the actual situation with HE 1104-1805. The\nHits column counts random runs whose best delay differed from the true delay by no more that 0.1 years. The\nRejected column counts correctly estimated delays which\nwere nevertheless rejected using the consistency argument\n(the correctly computed delay jumped more than 0.1 years\n\n1.0\n0.5\n0.2\n0.1\n0.05\n0.02\n0.01\n\n3\n\n\u03c4 = \u22120.84 years\n\u03b4 = 0.14\nHits Rejected\n\n\u03c4 = \u22120.71 years\n\u03b4 = 0.35\nHits Rejected\n\n99\n168\n491\n758\n940\n1000\n1000\n\n317\n383\n592\n840\n986\n1000\n1000\n\n55\n79\n164\n158\n108\n11\n0\n\n19\n7\n4\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\nTable 1. Hit and false rejection rates for the two series\nof model calculations. The model \"source curve\" was constructed by five point median filtering of the combined HE\n1104\u20131805 A curve and time shifted B curve. The level of\nthe redistributed errors was controlled by parameter R.\nThere were 1000 randomization runs in every experiment.\nHits counts events when a random run recovered the true\ntime delay with 0.1 year precision. Rejected counts cases\nwhen a correctly recovered time delay was rejected using\nthe consistency argument.\n\nafter \"cleaning\" was applied). As we can see, even for a\nstatistically more stable case with \u03b4 = 0.35 the false rejection rate is considerable for a range of error levels.\nHere we used the dispersion method to analyse the\nnotion of consistency, but all this applies equally well\nto the methods based on a discrete correlation function.\nThere we should only speak about \"for\" votes instead of\n\"against\" votes.\nThe comparison of the different time delay estimation\nschemes in GWW is based on this (not applicable) notion\nof consistency. From the available 38 measured values of\nHE 1104-1805 magnitudes the authors throw away up to 9\npoints (24%) assuming that such \"cleaning\" , if it results\nin consistent spectra (strongest minimum remains approximately in place), allows to \"eliminate border effects and\ngaps\".\n4. What then about the time delay for HE\n1104-1805?\nBefore describing our own analysis of the HE 1104-1805\ndata set let us note that the authors of the GWW are\nsomewhat inconsistent in their analysis from the very\nstart. When the dispersion spectrum is computed for the\nfull symmetric range of the time delays [\u22121.6, 1.6] (years)\nit is seen in Fig. 1 that the strongest minimum occurs at\na positive delay around 0.7 years (A leading B). The authors plot only part of the spectra in the asymmetric range\n[\u22121.6, 0.6] years without any specific explanation. From\nanalyses of the system geometry by Remy et al. (1998)\nand Wisotzki et al. (1998) it can, however, be concluded\nthat B should lead A and consequently it is resonable to\nseek only negative delays. This is why we restrict our anal-\n\n\f4\n\nJ. Pelt: Double quasar HE 1104-1805 time delay\n\nFig. 1. Dispersion spectra with \u03b4 = 0.3 years (thin line)\nand \u03b4 = 0.4 years (thick line). This is analoguous to Fig. 3\nin GWW, only computed for a symmetric range and with\ndifferent scaling.\n\nFig. 2. Dispersion spectrum for \u03b4 = 0.14 years. The left\nminimum at \u22120.86 years nearly exactly corresponds to\nthe solution obtained in GWW. The middle mimimum\nresults from the extreme sparseness of the data set for\ndelays between \u22120.65 and \u22120.4 years.\n\nysis below to the range of negative delays as well. Nevertheless, we consider the minimum at \u03c4 = 0.7 years as a\nstrong warning signal about possible problems with the\ntime delay estimation for HE 1104-1805.\nTo consistently compare the methods used in GWW\nwith the dispersion minimization method we first computed a simple spectrum with linear downweighting parameter \u03b4 = 0.14 years which corresponds to the semiwidth 0.07 years used in GWW. As seen from Fig. 2 there\nare two strong minima in the spectrum: at \u22120.86 and\n\u22120.47 years. The left minimum nearly exactly corresponds\nto the solution obtained in GWW. The right (and somewhat stronger) minimum is certainly a result of sparseness\nof the data. Just look at Fig. 3 where a so called \"window\nfunction\" for the dispersion spectrum is depicted. It shows\nfor every particular trial time delay how many data point\npairs have non-zero value (relevant voters!). We can easily\n\nFig. 3. \"Window function\" for the dispersion spectrum\nwith \u03b4 = 0.14 years. The number of data point pairs used\nfor dispersion estimation (and as well for correlation function computations) is extremely low in the region from\n\u22120.65 to \u22120.4 years.\nsee that the data is nearly totally blind for the time delays\nbetween \u22120.65 and \u22120.4 years.\nIt is interesting to recall that the well known data set of\nthe double quasar QSO 0957+561 which was used in Press\net al. (1992) and Pelt et al. (1994), consisted of 131 time\npoints and its data window minimum that occured around\n535 days had 43 pairs to compute dispersion from. By now\nit is generally accepted that the correct time delay in QSO\n0957+561 is about 420 days (Kundi\u0107 et al. 1997). Nevertheless, the sophisticated analysis by Press et al. (1992)\ndid result in the presumably wrong value around the minimum of the data window. In the case of HE 1104-1805\nwe have only 19 time points and there are fewer than 10\npairs to compute the dispersion (or correlation) for a large\nrange of time delays!\nBut probably most revealing is the set of spectra computed with \u03b4 = 0.14, 0.21, 0.28, 0.35 years and depicted all\ntogether in Fig. 4. One can see how the spectra tend to become smoother and statistically more stable with increasing \u03b4, how the fluctuation around \u22120.47 years gradually\ndisappears, and most importantly, how the minimum at\n\u22120.86 years moves first to \u22120.79 years, then to \u22120.78 years\nand finally to \u22120.71 years. This shift can be just a result\nof the bias which is introduced due the oversmoothing. It\nis also important to note that this consistent picture is\nobtained without any \"cleaning\" of the original data set.\nCan we now claim that the time delay estimate around\n\u22120.85 years is reasonably well established because it shows\nitself somehow (after \"cleaning\" of data) using the five\nmethods employed in GWW and even (more clearly) with\nuse of the standard dispersion minimization method? Unfortunately not. As seen from the bootstrap distribution\non Fig. 5 the scatter of the delays computed from trial\nruns is quite high and estimated delays cover nearly the\nfull range of the search. The mean of the bootstrap delays\nis \u22120.64 years, and their standard deviation is 0.23 years.\n\n\fJ. Pelt: Double quasar HE 1104-1805 time delay\n\n5\n\ntends always to be larger due to the possible outliers, unaccounted for systematic errors etc. The bootstrap method\ntries to take all this into account and correspondingly gives\nalso larger, and we think more realistic, error bars (see for\ninstance Burud et al. 2000). In the case of HE 1104\u20131805\neven the formal result \u22120.86 \u00b1 0.23 years can not be taken\ntoo seriously due to the bootstrap bias.\n\n5. Discussion\n\nFig. 4. Set of dispersion spectra for HE 1104\u20131805 computed with \u03b4 = 0.14, 0.21, 0.28, 0.35 years (increasing line\nthickness). It is seen that when moving towards the longer\nvalues of \u03b4 the spectra become smoother and statistically\nmore stable, the artefact of data sparseness around \u22120.47\nyears disappears and the minima around \u22120.8 years show\nincreasing (probable) shift due to the oversmoothing.\n\nFig. 5. Distribution of the 1000 bootstrap runs with\n\u03b4 = 0.14 years and \u03c4 = \u22120.86 years. Because of data\nsparseness it was possible to use only a 3 point median filter to get a rough estimate for a smooth combined curve.\nEven for this, certainly conservative scheme, we can see\nthat practically all possible delays resulted from the trial\nruns. The main maximum of the distribution (mode) occurs near the input delay but it is not strong enough to\ngive a support for \u2248 \u22120.85 year solution.\n\nThe large difference between the mean value of the bootstrap result and the correct input value (0.86\u22120.64 = 0.22\nyears) itself gives a strong warning that the data set at\nhand is not large enough to estimate the time delay properly.\nDetails of the bootstrap method as applied to the time\ndelay estimation can be found in Pelt et al. (1996). In\nGWW confidence limits for the time delay estimates were\ncomputed using magnitude errors given by the observers.\nIt is well known that the effective variability in data sets\n\nIf we look carefully at all five time delay estimation statistics used in GWW we see that, in principle, the results\nobtained can not very much differ from the results of the\ndispersion minimization method. All statistics used can\nbe looked upon as quadratic forms with delay and weighting dependent coefficients. They all have a free parameter\n(semiwidth of the bins or \u03b4) which controls smoothness\nagainst bias of the statistics. Correspondingly, it is quite\nnatural that the \u22120.85 years feature occurs in all of them.\nThe only important difference between the GWW methods and the dispersion minimization method is that GWW\nuses a data \"cleaning\" which is based on an inappropriate\nidea of consistency. Hence it is not clear how trustworthy\ntheir analysis is.\nWe are far from claiming that the dispersion minimization method is significantly better than any of those\nmethods described in GWW. Our basic emphasis is on\nthe transparency of the method, simplicity of its implementation and flexibility. As an explorative device it can\neffectively be used in most cases as a first trial. For a final\nand definitive time delay estimation other methods which\ndo not contain any free parameters should be used. One\nsuch method (for relatively large data sets) is the linear\nestimation method by Press et al. 1992 with certain extensions to take into account possible microlensing. For\nsmall data sets probably Bayesian methods (Loredo 1992)\ncan be useful (with priors from a large sample of variable\nquasars).\nNow about the time delay for HE 1104-1805. If we want\nto consider the problem as a full range search then it is\nquite obvious that 19 time points with the particular spacing are absolutely insufficient to estimate the time delay\nin this case. There is a wide range of delays which are not\neffectively covered by comparable time point pairs. Even\nif we look at another scenario where the acceptable time\ndelay range is a priori restricted to be from \u22121.0 years to\n\u22120.65 years, we can only say that there is a vague hint\nin the data that the time delay can be somewhere in the\nrange between \u22120.9 years and \u22120.7 years. Unfortunately\nthis precision is not enough for useful physical applications.\nFrom Fig. 3 we see that in order to obtain a realistic\nestimate for the time delay for HE 1104-1805 we need new\nobservations with better sampling. Especially needed are\nobservations which are about half a year apart.\n\n\f6\n\nJ. Pelt: Double quasar HE 1104-1805 time delay\n\nAcknowledgements.
