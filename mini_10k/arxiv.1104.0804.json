Introduction\nAt a distance of 3.8 \u00b1 0.1 Mpc (Harris et al. 2010), the giant elliptical galaxy Centaurus A (PKS 1322\u2212428, NGC 5128) is the\nclosest active galactic nucleus (AGN). Cen A is usually classified as a Fanaroff-Riley type I radio galaxy (Fanaroff & Riley\n1974) and it exhibits double-sided kiloparsec scale jets which\nend in giant radio lobes (Clarke et al. 1992). These jets are produced in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole with a mass\nof M = 5.5 \u00b1 3.0 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 (Israel 1998; Neumayer 2010). Due\nto the proximity of Cen A, an angular distance of one milliarcsecond (mas) corresponds to a linear size of just \u223c0.018 pc. This\nmakes it an exceptionally good laboratory for studying the innermost regions of AGN, for studying jet formation and collimation as well as testing different jet emission models. Cen A's\nparsec scale structure has been well studied at radio frequencies\nusing Southern-Hemisphere Very Long Baseline Interferometry\n(VLBI), revealing a bright jet and a faint counter-jet at a viewing angle of 50\u201380 degrees to the line of sight, with speeds\nranging from v = 0.1c to 0.45c measured on different scales\n(Tingay et al. 1998, 2001; Hardcastle et al. 2003). On subparsec scales, the radio jet-counterjet system was resolved with the\nVLBI Space Observatory Program (VSOP) by Horiuchi et al.\n(2006).\n\u22c6\n\nemail:cornelia.mueller@sternwarte.uni-erlangen.de\n\nCen A is detected across the spectrum. CGRO/EGRET found\nthe AGN to be a likely source of \u03b3-rays (Hartman et al. 1999)\nand recently, the Large Area Telescope (LAT; Atwood et al.\n2009) detector aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope\n(hereafter Fermi/LAT) detected strong \u03b3-ray emission from both\nthe central (nuclear) region (Abdo et al. 2010a) as well as the\ngiant radio lobes (Abdo et al. 2010b), while TeV emission was\ndetected by H.E.S.S. (Aharonian et al. 2009).\nThe Tracking Active Galactic Nuclei with Austral Millliarcsecond Interferometry program (TANAMI; Ojha et al. 2010)1\nhas been monitoring Cen A at two radio frequencies about two\ntimes a year since 2007 Nov. We present results from the\nTANAMI experiments in 2008 Nov (Sect. 2). These included for\nthe first time the TIGO and O'Higgins antennas (at 8.4 GHz), as\nwell as full participation of the Tidbinbilla 70 m antenna (at 8.4\nand 22.3 GHz) throughout the experiments, resulting in both the\nhighest resolution images of Cen A ever made and the highest\nfidelity spectral index map of its mas jet (Sect. 3). In Sect. 4, we\ndiscuss the structure of the inner parsec of Cen A and constraints\non the location of possible \u03b3-ray emission regions.\n\n2. Observations and Data Reduction\nTANAMI observations at 8.4 GHz (2008 Nov 27) and 22.3 GHz\n(2008 Nov 29) were made quasi-simultaneously with the\n1\n\nhttp://pulsar.sternwarte.uni-erlangen.de/tanami/\n\n\f2\n\nC.

In addition, we gauged the robustness of features in given regions of the map by iteratively testing the effect\nof self-calibrating the data without including these features in\nour clean models. We estimate the calibration uncertainties to\nbe on the order of 15 % at both frequencies. On-source errors\ndue to the uneven (u,v)-coverage were measured following the\nmethods described by Tingay & Murphy (2001) and found to be\nsmaller than 15 % along the inner \u223c15 mas of the jet. Beyond\nthis, the on-source errors gradually grow and can exceed 100 %\ntowards the counterjet at 8.4 GHz. We also compared our final\nimages with previous and subsequent, somewhat lower resolution, TANAMI observations (M\u00fcller et al. 2010) by identifying\nthe same main bright features to achieve a self-consistent multiepoch kinematics model which will be analyzed in a subsequent\npaper.\nFig. 1.

The LBA consists of\nfive telescopes, Parkes (64 m), ATCA (5\u00d722 m), Mopra (22 m)\nall in New South Wales, Hobart (26 m) in Tasmania, and Ceduna\n(30 m) in South Australia. Figure 1 shows the resulting (u,v)coverage for Cen A at both frequencies. Note that the resolution\nis lower at the higher frequency as GARS and TIGO cannot observe at 22.3 GHz. Data were recorded on LBA Disk Recorders\nand correlated on the DiFX software correlator (Deller et al.\n2007) at Curtin University in Perth, Western Australia and calibrated and imaged as described in Ojha et al. (2010).\n\n3. Results\nFigure 2 shows images of Cen A at 8.4 GHz and 22.3 GHz.\nImage parameters and observation characteristics are listed in\nTable 1. Using uniform weighting at 8.4 GHz, an angular resolution of 0.7 \u00d7 0.4 mas at a position angle (P.A.) of \u223c33\u25e6 ) is\nachieved corresponding to linear scales of less than 3500 AU.\nThe most important constraint on the fidelity of the 8.4 GHz\nimage is the lack of intermediate baselines between the LBA\nand the two transoceanic antennas, evident from \"holes\" in the\n(u,v)-plane (Fig. 1; see, e.g., Lister et al. 2000, for a discussion\nof possible effects due to uneven coverage of the (u,v)-plane).\nTo test the reliability of the imaging, we continuously checked\nwhether our clean model describes the uncalibrated visibility\n\nAt both frequencies, our images show a well collimated jet\nwith an opening angle \u03b8 . 12\u25e6 at a mean P.A. of \u03b8 \u223c50\u25e6 and\na fainter counterjet (\u03b8 \u223c\u2212130\u25e6 ) with an emission gap in between. At 22.3 GHz, the counterjet is considerably weaker: for\nthe 8.4 GHz counterjet feature around position R.A. = \u221218,\nDec = \u221214, we put a limit of the spectral index \u03b1 < \u22122.5\n(defined via F\u03bd \u221d \u03bd+\u03b1 ). Both the P.A. and the opening angle are\nremarkably similar to the corresponding values of P.A.arcmin =\n50\u25e6 \u221260\u25e6 and \u03b8arcmin \u223c12\u25e6 seen on scales of . 4 arcmin (4 kpc)\nfrom the central engine (Clarke et al. 1992). The feature with the\nhighest peak-flux density (see Table 1) has an inverted spectrum\n(see below) and therefore shares the characteristic properties of\nthe compact feature at the upstream-end of most blazar jets, typically called \"the core\" of the jet. Note that in the case of Cen A\nour linear resolution is orders of magnitude better than in most\nblazar-jet images and consequently most of the structure seen\nhere within the central parsec would be contained in \"the core\"\nif Cen A was observed at a smaller angle to the line of sight or at\nlarger distance. The significant emission features within the subparsec scale jet seen in the 2007 November 8.4 GHz TANAMI\nimage (M\u00fcller et al. 2010; Ojha et al. 2010) are in good agreement with those in this image observed one year later. A possible widening and subsequent narrowing of the jet appears at\n\u223c25 mas (\u2248 0.45 pc), and also in the earlier lower resolution image, as well as in the 22.3 GHz image (see Fig. 2). The peak-flux\ndensities at 8.4 GHz are comparable, 0.6 Jy in 2007 November\nand 0.7 Jy in 2008 November, indicating only a moderate radio\nflux variability. The 2008 November image reveals a small counterjet displacement from the jet axis. The overall jet structure is\nalso similar to the earlier 5 GHz VSOP image (Horiuchi et al.\n2006). This similarity suggests that at least some characteristic\nstructures are moving slowly compared to the jet speed measured in earlier works (0.1c\u20130.45c; Tingay et al. 1998, 2001;\nHardcastle et al. 2003).\nThe spectral distribution along the jet constrains the physical properties of the radio emission.

The inset shows the inner\nregion of Cen A at 8.4 GHz using uniform weighting. The lowest contours denote the 3\u03c3-noise-level (see Table 1). All axes are in\nunits of mas relative to the phase center. The ellipse in the lower left corner of each panel indicates the restoring beam.\ncalibration procedure leads to the loss of the absolute source position. Therefore, the frequency-dependent VLBI shift of selfabsorbed, optically thick emission features (e.g., Lobanov 1998)\nhas to be taken into account to assemble a spectral index map.\nWe determined the offset by aligning the positions of optically\nthin Gaussian model components, which are not affected by the\nshift, to be \u2206\u03b1rel = \u22120.25 mas and \u2206\u03b4rel = \u22120.2 mas.\n\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\nRecently, Fermi/LAT has detected \u03b3-ray emission from the core\nregion of Cen A (Abdo et al. 2010a) but the LAT positional accuracy does not allow to locate the \u03b3-ray emission to an accuracy of better than \u223c0.\u25e6 1. Our simultaneous dual-frequency\nVLBI data allow us to study spectral changes at sub-parsec\nscale and therefore to constrain the possible origin of the \u03b3ray emission from the core region of Cen A. To do this, we fit\nGaussian model components to the visibility data (see Table 2).\nWe can clearly resolve the 7 mas large core region imaged by\nHoriuchi et al. (2006) into two separate jet features. The brighter\nfeature at the base of the jet, with an angular extent of \u223c3 mas,\ncan be described with three Gaussian model components at the\nhigher-resolution 8.4 GHz image while two components are sufficient to represent the lower-resolution 22.3 GHz core region.\nWe identify this region as the innermost visible part of the jet\nat this frequency (more central parts being self-absorbed). The\nsecond bright emission feature at \u223c3.5 mas downstream at both\nfrequencies was also detected by TANAMI in 2007 November\n(Ojha et al. 2010) and might correspond to the stationary component detected by Tingay et al. (2001) at \u223c4 mas. Co-spatial with\nthe jet-widening region at \u223c23 mas at 8.4 GHz, the 22.3 GHz\nimage suggests a possible emission component, which might be\ninterpreted as an absorbing feature. However, the limited (u, v)coverage does not allow us to fully constrain the exact spatial\ndistribution of this emission feature and consequently spatially\nresolved spectroscopic analysis has to be treated with caution.\nFigure 3 represents the first sub-parsec scale dual-frequency\nimage of Cen A. The core region has an inverted spectrum (spectral index 0 < \u03b1 < 2) which changes from flat to steep down-\n\nstream. Remarkably, the spectrum remains flat for the inner few\nmilliarcseconds of the jet, indicating multiple optically thick\nemission regions in the core region although a gradual steepening behaviour can be seen. These optically thick regions can\nbe identified as multiple possible production sites of the high\nenergy photons because they all show high brightness temperatures, compact, structures, and flat radio spectra. This should\nbe considered in the discussion of single-zone versus multizone emission models of the broadband spectral energy distribution of Cen A and other extragalactic jets. Recent studies of\nCen A (Abdo et al. 2010a; Roustazadeh & B\u00f6ttcher 2011) modeling the full radio to TeV range of the broadband spectrum have\nused TANAMI spectral data from the inner 0.9 mas \u00d7 0.29 mas2 .\nAs Fig. 3 shows, the peak of the innermost counterjet feature\nat 22.3 GHz is offset by about 1 mas to the south-west with respect to the 8 GHz image. This offset could be interpreted as a\nsign of free-free absorption in an obscuring torus as observed\nin other two-sided extragalactic jets (e.g., Kadler et al. 2004).\nIn this case, however, it is puzzling that the well-defined 8 GHz\ncomponent at \u2206\u03b1 = \u22124 mas, \u2206\u03b4 = \u22122 mas seems to have no obvious counterpart at 22.3 GHz. Free-free absorption has been observed before in the central region of Cen A (Tingay & Murphy\n2001). In fact, this may also affect the innermost part of the eastern jet and could be an alternative explanation for the observed\nflat spectral index distribution.\nIn contrast to M87 (Junor et al. 1999), no rapid broadening\nof the jet opening angle is seen, although the linear resolutions\nare comparable. The jet of Cen A is therefore already well collimated on scales of 0.1 pc = 1015 m. Beyond this distance, the\nopening angle is \u223c12\u25e6, about the same value as measured on\nkpc-scales (Clarke et al. 1992). However, the mass of the central\nblack hole of M87 is two orders of magnitude higher than that\nof Cen A so we are accessing a very different part of the jet as\nmeasured in Schwarzschild radii.\nWe plan to determine the evolution of spectral index and\nthe proper motion using observations from multiple TANAMI\n2\n\nNote the slightly different model component values as compared to\nthe values reported in Abdo et al. (2010a), which reflect self-calibration\nand model-fitting uncertainties.\n\n\f4\n\nC.
