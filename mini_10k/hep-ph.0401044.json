Both phenomena are\naccessible experimentally at the TeV energy scale.\n\n\fIn the Standard Model of quarks and leptons, the electric charge has two components,\ni.e.\n1\nQ = I3L + Y,\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere I3L comes from SU(2)L and Y from U(1)Y . If the gauge group is extended to include\nSU(2)R , then there are two possible decompositions of the electric charge. One is based on\n[1] SU(4)C \u2192 SU(3)C \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L , i.e.\n1\nQ = I3L + I3R + (B \u2212 L).\n2\n\n(2)\n\nThe other is based on SU(3)L \u2192 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)YL and SU(3)R \u2192 SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)YR , i.e.\n1\n1\nQ = I3L + I3R \u2212 YL \u2212 YR .\n2\n2\n\n(3)\n\n[The minus signs in the above expression are due to a convention which will become clear\nlater.] Whereas Eq. (2) is indicative of SO(10) as the unification group, Eq. (3) is indicative\nof [2] SU(3)C \u00d7 SU(3)L \u00d7 SU(3)R . However, the two are in fact equivalent if considered as\nsubgroups of E6 .\nUsing Eq. (2), under SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L , the quarks and leptons transform as\n1\nq = (u, d)L \u223c (2, 1, ),\n6\n\n1\nq c = (dc , uc )L \u223c (1, 2, \u2212 ),\n6\n\n(4)\n\n1\nlc = (ec , \u03bd c )L \u223c (1, 2, ).\n2\n\n(5)\n\n1\nl = (\u03bd, e)L \u223c (2, 1, \u2212 ),\n2\n\nThey are different in their electric charges because they have different B \u2212 L values. Using\nEq. (3), under SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)YL \u00d7 U(1)YR ,\n1\nq \u223c (2, 1, , 0),\n6\n\n1\nq c \u223c (1, 2, 0, \u2212 ),\n6\n\n1 1\nl \u223c (2, 1, \u2212 , \u2212 ),\n6 3\n\n2\n\n1 1\nlc \u223c (1, 2, , ).\n3 6\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\n\fHere the differences come from the fact that the leptons belong to the (1, 3, 3\u2217) representation\nof SU(3)C \u00d7 SU(3)L \u00d7 SU(3)R , whereas q and q c belong to the (3, 3\u2217, 1) and 3\u2217 , 1, 3) representations respectively. Note that (YL , YR ) = (\u22121/3, 0), (0, \u22121/3), (1/3, 2/3), (\u22121/3, \u22122/3)\nrespectively for q, q c , l, lc in these representations. This explains the minus signs in Eq. (3).\nAt this point, a curious fact must have already been noticed, i.e. the electric charge\nhas two components in Eq. (1), three in Eq. (2), and four in Eq. (3). How about five or\nmore? Using the idea of a separate SU(3)l for leptons [3], which results in a successful\nnonsupersymmetric SU(3)4 model [4], the electric charge may indeed have five components,\ni.e.\n1\n1\n1\nQ = I3L + I3R \u2212 YL \u2212 YR \u2212 Yl ,\n2\n2\n2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere Yl comes from SU(3)l \u2192 SU(2)l \u00d7 U(1)Yl . In this case,\n1\nq \u223c (2, 1, , 0, 0),\n6\n\n1\nq c \u223c (1, 2, 0, \u2212 , 0),\n6\n\n1\n1\nl \u223c (2, 1, \u2212 , 0, \u2212 ),\n6\n3\n\n1 1\nlc \u223c (1, 2, 0, , ).\n6 3\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nGoing back to Eq. (3), it is also clear that quarks and leptons may belong to different\nSU(3)L 's and SU(3)R 's, so that the electric charge has eight components, i.e.\n1\n1\n1\n1\nQ = (I3 )qL + (I3 )qR \u2212 YqL \u2212 YqR + (I3 )lL + (I3 )lR \u2212 YlL \u2212 YlR .\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(11)\n\nCombining this notion of quark-lepton nonuniversality [5, 6, 7] with that of chiral color\n[8], the group SU(3)6 is then obtained. Note that this is very different from the previously\nproposed [9] nonsupersymmetric SU(4)6 model which predicted a value of sin2 \u03b8W very far\naway from the present data. A good way of displaying the structure of this symmetry is\nagain a hexagonal \"moose\" diagram [10] (Fig. 1) with the assignments\nq \u223c (3, 3\u2217, 1, 1, 1, 1),\n\n(12)\n\nx \u223c (1, 3, 3\u2217, 1, 1, 1),\n\n(13)\n\n3\n\n\f\u03b7\n\nSU(3)CL\n\nSU(3)CR\n\nq\n\nqc\nSU(3)qR\n\nSU(3)qL\nx\n\nxc\n\nSU(3)lL\n\nSU(3)lR\n\n\u03bb\n\nFigure 1: Moose diagram of quarks and leptons in [SU(3)]6 .\n\u03bb \u223c (1, 1, 3, 3\u2217, 1, 1),\n\n(14)\n\nxc \u223c (1, 1, 1, 3, 3\u2217, 1),\n\n(15)\n\nq c \u223c (1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3\u2217),\n\n(16)\n\n\u03b7 \u223c (3\u2217 , 1, 1, 1, 1, 3),\n\n(17)\n\nunder SU(3)CL \u00d7SU(3)qL \u00d7SU(3)lL \u00d7SU(3)lR \u00d7SU(3)qR \u00d7SU(3)CR . It reduces to the wellknown SU(3)C \u00d7 SU(3)L \u00d7 SU(3)R model if the x, xc , \u03b7 links are all contracted. It is also the\nnatural anomaly-free extension of chiral color (the \u03b7 link) and quark-lepton nonuniversality\n(the x, xc links).\nThe particle content of this model is given by\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\nd u h\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nq=\uf8ec\n\uf8edd u h\uf8f8,\nd u h\n\ndc\n\uf8ec c\nqc = \uf8ec\n\uf8edu\nhc\n\uf8eb\n\ndc\nuc\nhc\n\ndc\n\uf8f7\nuc \uf8f7\n\uf8f8,\nc\nh\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\nN\n\uf8ec\n\u03bb=\uf8ec\n\uf8edE\n\u03bdc\n\nEc\nNc\nec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u03bd\n\uf8f7\ne\uf8f7\n\uf8f8,\nS\n\n(18)\n\nwhere the rows denote (I3 , Y ) = (1/2, 1/3), (\u22121/2, 1/3), (0, \u22122/3), and the columns denote\n(I3 , Y ) = (\u22121/2, \u22121/3), (1/2, \u22121/3), (0, 2/3), with x and xc having the same electric charge\nassignments as \u03bb, and all the components of \u03b7 are neutral. The doubling of SU(3)3 to SU(3)6\nalso allows the six gauge couplings to unify with sin2 \u03b8W equal to the canonical 3/8 at the\nunification scale. To check this, consider the contributions of q, x, \u03bb, xc , q c , \u03b7 to\n4\n\nP\n\n2\nI3L\nand\n\n\fP\n\nQ2 :\n2\n\nsin \u03b8W\n\n3\n2\n+ 3 + 32 + 0 + 0 + 0\n6\n3\nI3L\n2\n=\n= ,\n= P 2 =\nQ\n2+4+4+4+2+0\n16\n8\n\nP\n\n(19)\n\nas expected. Note that in the SU(3)4 model [4] of leptonic color, sin2 \u03b8W = 1/3 at the\nunification scale.\nThere is another reason for choosing SU(3)6 . If chiral color is invoked without separate\nSU(2)L gauge groups for quarks and leptons, then an SU(3)4 model with sin2 \u03b8W = 3/8 is\npossible. However, because\n1\n1\n1\n=\n+\n,\n\u03b1s\n\u03b1CL \u03b1CR\n\n(20)\n\n\u03b1s would be wrong by at least a factor of two. As it is, SU(3)6 allows the intriguing possibility that both chiral color and quark-lepton nonuniversality may exist at experimentally\naccessible energies, as shown below.\nLet the neutral scalar components of the supermultiplets corresponding to xc11 , xc22 , xc13 ,\nxc31 , xc33 , x33 , and \u03bb33 acquire large vacuum expectation values, then SU(3)6 is broken down\nto\nSU(3)CL \u00d7 SU(3)CR \u00d7 SU(2)qL \u00d7 SU(2)lL \u00d7 U(1)Y .\n\n(21)\n\nThis symmetry embodies both the notions of chiral color and quark-lepton nonuniversality\nand is assumed to be valid down to MS , the supersymmetry breaking scale. The particles\nwhich remain massless between MS and MU , the unification scale, are assumed to be three\ncopies of q, q c , and \u03b7, three copies of all the components of x except x33 , three copies of\n(\u03bd, e) and (ec , \u03bd c ) in \u03bb, but only one copy of the (N, E; E c , N c ) bidoublet in \u03bb. This particle\ncontent generalizes that of the MSSM (Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model), where\nthere are three families of quarks and leptons, but only one pair of Higgs doublets.

The\n7\n\n\fvalue of MU is of order 1016 GeV, in good agreement with the usual theoretical expectation.\nThus a new and remarkably successful model of grand unification is obtained. It is also\nexperimentally verifiable because it predicts specific new particles necessarily below the TeV\nenergy scale.\nTable 1: Values of \u03b1s (MZ ) and MU /MZ as functions of MS /MZ .\nMS /MZ\n1.0\n1.5\n2.2\n3.3\n5.0\n7.6\n\n\u03b1s (MZ )\n0.119\n0.118\n0.117\n0.116\n0.115\n0.114\n\nMU /MZ\n2.1 \u00d7 1014\n1.9 \u00d7 1014\n1.7 \u00d7 1014\n1.5 \u00d7 1014\n1.4 \u00d7 1014\n1.2 \u00d7 1014\n\nThe expected new particles and their supersymmetric partners are as follows. (1) Three\ncopies of the exotic h(hc ) quarks as in SU(3)3 or E6 . (2) Eight axigluons [8] corresponding to\nthe breaking of SU(3)CL \u00d7 SU(3)CR to SU(3)C . (3) Three sets of neutral (3, 3\u2217) \u03b7 particles\nwhich are reorganized into octets and singlets under SU(3)C . (4) Three vector gauge bosons\ncorresponding to the breaking of SU(2)qL \u00d7 SU(2)lL to SU(2)L . (5) Three (2,2) bidoublets\nwhich are reorganized into triplets and singlets under SU(2)L . (6) Three sets of SU(2)L\ndoublets (\u03bdx , ex ) and (ecx , \u03bdxc ).\nThe presence of SU(2)L nonsinglets is a potential phenomenological problem with respect\nto the precision electroweak measurements. However, all such new particles, i.e. those listed\nunder (4), (5), and (6) in the above, have masses which are invariant under SU(2)L . Hence\ntheir contributions to the electroweak oblique parameters are all very much suppressed.\nThey are however necessary because they render the SU(2)qL \u00d7 SU(2)lL gauge extension\n[7] anomaly-free. This is also the purpose of the new SU(3)C octets and singlets (the \u03b7\n\n8\n\n\fparticles) with respect to SU(3)CL \u00d7 SU(3)CR . Thus this model has very unique predictions\nwhich are verifiable experimentally.\nIf the scale at which SU(3)CL \u00d7 SU(3)CR reduces to the canonical SU(3)C is MA instead\nof MS with MA > MS , then Eqs. (43) and (44) are modified to read\n!\n\nMS\n1\n4\n3\n1\nMA\n1\n+\n35 ln\n,\n=\n\u2212\n\u2212 27 ln\n\u03b1s (MZ )\n7 \u03b12 (MZ ) \u03b1Y (MZ )\n14\u03c0\nMZ\nMZ\n!\n\u0012\n\u0013\nMU\n\u03c0\n1\nMS\nMA\n3\n5\nln\n=\n\u2212\n7 ln\n\u2212 3 ln\n.\n\u2212\nMZ\n14 \u03b1Y (MZ ) \u03b12 (MZ )\n14\nMZ\nMZ\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(47)\n(48)\n\nThis would allow MS to be somewhat larger, say of order 1 TeV.\nIn conclusion, a new model of grand unification has been proposed based on SU(3)6 ,\nwhich is a natural extension of two seemingly disparate notions, i.e. chiral color and quarklepton nonuniversality. In the context of supersymmetry, it has been shown that the five\ngauge couplings corresponding to SU(3)CL \u00d7SU(3)CR \u00d7SU(2)qL \u00d7SU(2)lL \u00d7U(1)Y naturally\nconverge to a single value at MU of order 1016 GeV, and the scale at which this symmetry\nreduces to the standard SU(3)C \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y is not more than a few times that of\nelectroweak symmetry breaking. This is a natural generalization of the MSSM and may be\neasily distinguished from it experimentally because specific new particles are predicted to\nexist below the TeV energy scale, and should be accessible at accelerators in the near future.\n\nThis work was supported in part by the U.
