Studying the series expansion of the thermodynamic potential for the\nhard\u2013core N 3 lattice gas model, we provide evidence for a first order phase transition\nwith a finite jump in density and entropy, in agreement with numerical transfer\nmatrix calculations. The solid branch terminates at the critical activity zc, but the\nfluid branch continues beyond zc, describing a super-cooled fluid. It terminates with\n\n/\n\ncp\n\n~ 0.85 and finite entropy per lattice site. This termination density is close to\n\nthe random-closest-packing density of the glassy state obtained for infinitely-fast\ncooling. The model thus exhibits a thermodynamic meta-stable glassy phase with\nfinite Edwards' compactivity.\n\nPACS: 05.70.Fn, 64.60.Cn, 64.70.Pf\n\n\fThe lattice gas model with nearest-neighbors hard core exclusion is long known to\nundergo a continuous phase transition from a low density disordered fluid state to an\nordered solid phase [1-6]. On the other hand studies of the continuum model of three\ndimensional hard spheres (which are the limit of lattice models with an extended\nexclusion) indicate a first order transition with coexistence of solid and super-cooled\nfluid phases [7,8]. The nature of the transition in the hard disks case is not clear yet\n[9]. It is therefore expected that the nature of the phase transition depends on the\nrange of the hard core interaction.\n\nBellemans and Orban [10], and later Orban and Van Belle [11], have studied\nnumerically the lattice gas model of hard particles on the two dimensional square\nlattice, with interaction range that extends up to the third shell of nearest neighbors\n(N 3 model). This model is identical to the model of hard-core symmetric crossshaped pentamers on the square lattice. Using the matrix method of Kramers and\nWannier [3] they studied rings of infinite length and finite width M, for M=5, 10, 15\n[10], and 20 [11]. The symmetry of the model requires that the width M is a multiple\nof 5, otherwise the system cannot reach the configuration of closest packing, whose\ndensity is\n\ncp\n\n1 5 . Analysis of the numerical results suggests that the N 3 model\n\nexhibits a first order phase transition. This model is believed to be the simplest\nmodel that exhibits a first order transition. Furthermore, we have recently shown that\nthis is also the simplest model that exhibits a glass transition, resulting from a random\nfilling process controlled by diffusion (RSAD) [12]. This process terminates in a\nstable random packing state, at the density\n\nrcp\n\n0.171626(3) (here and in the\n\n\ffollowing, the number in parentheses is the uncertainty in the last digit). Therefore, it\nis worthwhile to study the properties of this exclusion model, focusing in particular\non the relations between the critical values: z c\n\nexp(\n\nc\n\n) ,\n\nf\n\n(zc ) ,\n\ns\n\n( z c ) (the\n\ncritical activity, the density of the fluid at the transition, and that of the solid at the\ntransition, respectively) and the termination values of the fluid and the solid\nbranches, looking for signatures of the glassy behavior in the thermodynamic\nproperties.\n\nIn this letter we study the nature of this phase transition through the analytic\nproperties of the low-density and high-density expansions of the thermodynamic\nfunctions as a function of the activity. Looking at the analytic properties of these\nseries we show the existence of a first-order transition and the coexistence of the\nsolid phase with a super-cooled phase, extending beyond the critical activity. We\nsupport our results by extending the numerical matrix-method calculations to M=25.\nThe termination density of the super-cooled fluid branch, as derived from\nextrapolating the low-density series, turns out to be very similar to\n\nrcp\n\n, the limiting\n\ndensity of the glassy phase obtained for infinitely fast cooling through the RSAD\nprocess [12]. This last result suggests that the super-cooled phase might have the\ncharacteristics of a glassy state for finite large activities beyond the transition. If this\nis the case, this model may serve as a minimal model for studying the properties of\nstructural glasses.\n\n\fWe start by describing the numerical results obtained using the matrix method, which\nwe extend here up to M=25. The approximants for the density\n\nM\n\n( z)\n\nz d (ln max )\nM\ndz\n\nas well as their derivatives are practically M-independent outside of the critical\nregion. However, for 0.155\n\n0.19 , their M-dependence is profound. In\n\nd\nd\n\nparticular, the compressibility K\n2\n\nlike M , and width decreases like M\n\n2\n\nhas a sharp peak, whose height diverges\n. This is interpreted as a signature of a first\n\norder phase transition, where a continuous transition exhibits only a weaker,\nlogarithmic, divergence of this peak [3]. Table 1 presents the compressibility\nmaximum\n\nc\n\n( M ) , the pressure at zc\n\nexp(\n\nc\n\n) , the compressibility maximum and\n\nthe density at the maximum for the different values of M, as well as the densities of\nthe left (fluid) and right (solid) inflection points of the peak.\n\nM\n\nc\n\np( z c )\n\nTable 1\n( z c ( M ))\n\nKmax\n\nf\n\ns\n\n10\n\n3.6358\n\n0.74769\n\n0.1746\n\n.0430\n\n0.1640\n\n0.1860\n\n15\n\n3.6682\n\n0.74408\n\n0.1757\n\n.0879\n\n0.1666\n\n0.1850\n\n20\n\n3.6737\n\n0.74282\n\n0.17604\n\n.1580\n\n0.1678\n\n0.1844\n\n25\n\n3.6751\n\n0.74225\n\n0.1763\n\n.2629\n\n0.1699\n\n0.1851\n\n3.6762(1) 0.74124(2)\n\nThe critical chemical potential converges like ~ M\nleading to\n\nc\n\n3.6762(1) , or z c\n\nzc converges like M\n\n2\n\n4\n\ntowards it's asymptotic value,\n\n39.496(4) .

One thus\n\n\fsees that the matrix method calculations provide quite accurate estimations for the\ncritical parameters, and the nature of the global minimum of the free energy. However\nthey do not give an accurate estimation of the density gap at the transition, and do not\nprovide any information on the possibility of meta-stable solid or fluid phases.\n\nWe now turn to study analytically the asymptotic expansion of the thermodynamic\npotential. The thermodynamic functions of the solid branch can be expanded around\nthe closest-packing configuration, in terms of u=1/z, the activity of holes. The\npressure and density are given by:\np( z )\n\n1\n{ln( z )\n5\n1\n{1\n5\n\n( z)\n\nbn' u n }\n\n(1a)\n\nn 1\n\nnbn' u n }\n\n(1b)\n\nn 1\n\n'\n\nWe derive the first six coefficients bn of the high-density series by the enumeration\n'\n\nmethod of ref. [2]. The integer coefficients nbn are presented in table 2: (the first\nfour coefficients were given in ref [11], with a minor error in the fourth one).\n\nn\n\n1\n\n2\n\nTable 2\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nnbn'\n\n1\n\n11\n\n199\n\n4559\n\n117811\n\n3287315\n\nA ratio-method type analysis leads to the following unbiased fit for the coefficients:\nnbn'\n\n1.0097 39.2425 ( n 1) n\n\n1.8713\n\n(2)\n\n\fThe maximum deviation is of 1.5% for n=2, and the higher order coefficients are\nreproduced with relative accuracy better than 10-4. The value of the leading\nexponential term being so close to zc (as estimated from the numerical matrix\n1\n\nmethod results) strongly suggest that z c is indeed the radius of convergence of the\nhigh-density series. In addition, we verified that Levin [13] and Pade approximants of\n'\n\nthe series n bn for 2.80\n\n2.90 diverge for u\n\nzc 1 .

We find the\ncompressibility ~\n\nd\nto diverge at zc like ( z z c )\ndu\n\nwith the critical exponent\n\n0.10(1) , and the critical density and pressure are given by:\n\ns\n\n( zc )\n\nps ( z c )\n\nwhere\n\n1.0388\n0.0388 0.045\n1\n{1\n(1.9051)\nO( zc 3 )} 0.1910(1)\n2\n5\nzc\nzc\nzc\n\n1\n1.0388\n0.0388 0.0225\n{1\n(2.9051)\nO(zc 3 )} 0.74147 (2)\n2\n5\nzc\nzc\nzc\n\n(4a)\n\n(4b)\n\n( x ) is the Riemann zeta function. Both critical parameters are in a good\n\nagreement with Levin and Pade approximants. Note that the value of the critical\npressure obtained here from the series expansion is identical to the numerical value\nobtained by the matrix method (table 1).\n\nThe fluid phase is described by the low-density Mayer cluster expansion in powers of\nthe activity z. The convergence radius of this series is determined by a non-physical\n\n\fsingularity at a point on the negative z axis z\n\nz0 , which is typically very close to\n\nthe origin compared to zc . Using the M=25 matrix, we derived the 12th and 13th\ncluster coefficients (the first 11 coefficients were already found in [11]). Utilizing the\n13 available cluster coefficients and the universal asymptotic form of the cluster\ncoefficients of two dimensional repulsive models [14,15]:\nbn\n\n(\n\n1 ( n 1)\n)\nn\nz0\n\n11\n\n6\n\n(1 cn\n\n5\n\n6\n\n(5)\n\n)\n\nwe estimate the location of the leading singularity by the Levin acceleration\nmethod[13] to be z 0\n\n0.046530(1) . The ratio\n\nzc\nz0\n\n850 is very big and it seems,\n\nnaively, that the series cannot be extrapolated to the transition region and beyond.\nHowever, one can use the well-defined pattern of the cluster coefficients of classical\nrepulsive systems to overcome this obstacle. Taking into account the fact that the\nentire spectrum of the tri-diagonal matrix representations (Yang-Lee zeroes) of such\nsystems lies on the real axis [16], it is possible to transform the series to tractable\nforms in spite of the screening effect of the leading singularity. The result of this\napproach were also confirmed by Levin summation of the activity series applying the\ntransformation z\n\nw exp(aw) .\n\nTable 3\n3\n\nn\n\n1\n\nRnn\n\n13.\n\n10.777778 10.777971 10.762752 10.755267 10.751491\n\n6.\n\n5.495509\n\nRn n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n5.424623\n\n4\n\n5.402505\n\n5\n\n5.392250\n\n6\n\n5.386690\n\n\fFollowing the matrix representation notation of [16], table 3 presents the values of\nthe matrix elements of the symmetric tri-diagonal matrix R, defined by:\n\n( R n )11\n\n(n 1) bn\n\n1\n\n, where bn are the Mayer expansion coefficients. The matrix\n\nelements are obtained from the first 13 cluster coefficients. They rapidly converge to\nconstant asymptotic values along the main and sub-diagonal, as expected for\nrepulsive models [16]. Thus, the matrix R becomes a tri-diagonal Toeplitz-like\nmatrix, whose asymptotic constant values B (diagonal) and A (off diagonal) are\n\nz0 and\n\nrelated to the two branch points of the fluid thermodynamic functions at\nzt by:\nz0 1\n\n2A B\n\nzt 1\n\n2A B\n\n(6)\n\nwhere zt is the termination point of the fluid phase. Extrapolating the values given in\ntable 3, one finds (see figure 2) that 2A+B=21.4907(3), in excellent agreement with\nthe above direct estimate of the non-physical singularity location z 0\nwhile 2A-B extrapolates to 0.0054(3), leading to z t\n\n1\n\n21.4915(5) ,\n\n180(25) . It thus follows that\n\none can certainly exclude the possibility of the fluid branch terminating at the\ntransition activity, leading to the conclusion that a super-cooled fluid exists for the\nactivity range zc\n\nz\n\nzt .\n\nUsing the asymptotic Toeplitz form for the R matrix, and employing the extrapolated\nvalues of the matrix elements, we computed an approximant for the density\n\nThe pressure of the fluid phase at the critical activity is estimated to be\npT ( z c ) 0.74083(4) , in agreement with the matrix method estimate\n\nT\n\n(z ) .\n\n\fpc\n\n0.74124(2) . The difference is greater than the combined uncertainties, but still\n\nvery small. The density at the critical activity is estimated to be\nT\n\n(zc )\n\n0.15803(10) . Thus, the density gap at the transition is\n\n0.0330(2) (or\n\n0.165(1) in units of the closest-packing density), and the entropy gap at the transition\nis\n\ns\nk\n\nln( z c )\n\nfluid, the density is\n\n0.1213(7) (per site). At the termination point of the super-cooled\n\nT\n\n( zt )\n\n0.175(1) and the entropy is\n\ns\nk\n\n0.08(1) . Notably, this\n\ntermination density is remarkably close to the random closest packing density\nobtained for this model upon infinitely fast cooling [12]. It is thus tempting to suggest\nthat as the activity increases, the super-cooled fluid branch freezes into a glass, with\nlimiting density being the random closest packing density, and finite Edwards'\ncompactivity [17].\n\nIn summary, we have studied the analytic properties of the high-density and lowdensity activity series of the thermodynamic functions for the N3 lattice-gas model.\nWe find that the solid branch terminates at finite activity, suggesting the existence of\na phase transition. The termination activity and pressure are in excellent agreement\nwith those determined by the numerical transfer matrix method, as well as with the\npressure as calculated from the fluid branch at the critical activity, supporting the\nvalidity of the analytic expansion. The fluid branch does not terminate at the critical\nactivity but rather extrapolates to describe a meta-stable super-cooled fluid phase,\nwhich terminates with finite entropy per site (Edwards' compactivity [17]) and density\nvery close to that of a glass obtained by infinitely fast cooling of the system. We thus\n\n\fsuggest that the simple N3 lattice gas model can serve as a minimal model for the\nstudy of structural glasses.\n\nReferences\n\n1. R.J. Baxter, J. Phys. A, 13, L61 (1980).\n2. D.S.
