In turn, the Milky Way (MW) is playing a role\nreshaping these galaxies and creating the spectacular Magellanic Stream (hereafter MS). The MS is a trailing filament\nof neutral hydrogen that originates from the Magellanic\nClouds and stretches for over \u223c 100 degrees in the Southern\nSky and is the most prominent signature of an interaction\nbetween the Clouds and the Milky Way. The combined\ninteraction between these three galaxies must strongly\ninfluence the morphological evolution of the Clouds, as well\nas their internal kinematics and star formation history.\nA resonant interaction between the Galaxy and the LMC\ncould even be sufficient to excite the warp observed in the\nGalactic disk (Weinberg 1995, 1998).\nSeveral models have been proposed in order to study the\nnature of this interaction and to isolate the main mechanism\nresponsible for the formation of the Stream. These models\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: chiara@physik.unizh.ch\n\nhave become increasingly refined over the years. The first\ngravitational tidal models took into account just the binary\ninteraction between the LMC and MW (Lin & Lynden-Bell\n1977; Murai & Fujimoto 1980), but later models included\na close interaction between the Clouds themselves during a\nprevious passage at the perigalacticon about 1.5 Gyrs ago\n(Gardiner, Sawa, & Fujimoto 1994; Lin, Jones, & Klemola\n1995; Gardiner & Noguchi 1996).\nThe strongest argument which supports a tidal origin\nfor the MS is provided by the discovery of neutral hydrogen in front of the LMC (Putman et al. 1998). However the\namount of material in this feature is just a fraction of the\nmass of the MS (Putman et al. 2003a). However there are\nsome characteristics of the Stream that tidal models cannot\nexplain. In particular they fail in reproducing the gradual\ndecrease of the HI column density and the lack of a stellar tidal feature (Mathewson et al. 1979; Brueck & Hawkins\n1983; Guhathakurta & Reitzel 1998). Stars are expected to\nbe stripped by gravitational forces along with the gas, although Weinberg (2000) suggests that the stellar debris\nwould have a different distribution respect to the gaseous\nStream and form a diffuse envelope around the LMC. Traces\nof an offset old stellar stream could be identified with the\n\n\f2\n\nC. Mastropietro et al.\n\ngiant stars observed by Majewski et al. (1999) around the\nMagellanic Clouds.\nA hydrodynamical interaction has also been invoked\nto explain the Stream. Mathewson et al. (1987) proposed\nthat gas is swept away from the intra-cloud region and decelerated by random collisions with high velocity clouds\n(HVC). This model requires unrealistic densities for the\nHVCs in the MW halo in order to justify the high number of encounters that should generate the Stream and does\nnot explain the column density gradient. Continuous stripping models (Meurer, Bicknell & Gingold 1985; Sofue 1994;\nMoore & Davis 1994) propose a scenario in which gas is\nstripped by ram-pressure forces from the outer regions of\nthe Clouds through an interaction with a distribution of hot\ngas in the halo or an extended ionised disk. A satellite moving with a relative velocity v respect to this external medium\nof density \u03c1 experiences a pressure P = \u03c1v 2 which can be\nsufficient to remove part of the neutral gas from the disk.\nTogether with the difficulties in creating a continuous\nleading arm \u2013 although the stripped material decelerated\nby ram pressure forces could fall on smaller orbits and\nlead the Clouds (Sofue 1994; Moore & Davis 1994) \u2013 ram\npressure models are thought to be able to reproduce the\nlarge amount of gas observed in the Stream (\u223c 2 \u00d7 108 M\u2299\naccording to Putman et al. 2003a).\nThe presence of an extended hot halo surrounding the\nMW and in hydrostatic equilibrium within the dark matter\npotential is expected by current models of hierarchical\nstructure formation (White & Frenk 1991). This gaseous\nhalo, left over from the initial collapse, would be continuously fuelled by accretion of satellite galaxies over time.\nRecent observational results have confirmed the existence\nof a distribution of hot (T \u223c 106 K) gas well beyond the\nGalactic disk, with a radius larger than 70 kpc in order\nto explain some ionisation features discovered in the MS\n(Sembach et al 2003; Putman et al. 2003b). Constraints\nfrom dynamical and thermal arguments fix the density of\nthe gaseous halo in a range between 10\u22125 and 10\u22124 cm\u22123 at\nthe LMC distance from the Galactic center. The Clouds are\ntherefore subjected along their orbits to the ram pressure\ngenerated by a tenuous distribution of hot gas and the\nMagellanic System itself seems to be the result of a complex\ninteraction that involves both hydrodynamical and tidal\nprocesses.\nThe aim of this work is to study for the first time the\nsimultaneous effect of gravitational and hydrodynamical\nforces acting on the LMC as it moves within the Galactic\nhalo, using fully self consistent galaxy models. In particular\nwe are interested in the formation and evolution of the\nMagellanic Stream and in the dynamical changes in the\ninternal structure of the LMC due to the interaction with\nthe MW. We ignore the SMC owing to its small mass\n(\u223c 10% of the LMC), neglecting the possibility of a close\nencounter between the two Clouds and the consequence of\nadditional loss of mass. This approximation would lead to\nan underestimation of the amount of HI in the Stream.\nThis paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we\npresent the main characteristics of the galaxy models that\nwe use. The results of test wind tube simulations are dis-\n\nTable 1.

In Section 4 we analyse the results of\nthe interacting runs regarding the Stream and the LMC disk.\n\n2\n\nGALAXY MODELS\n\nThe initial conditions of the simulations are constructed\nusing the technique described by Hernquist (1993). Both\nthe Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud are multicomponent systems with a stellar and gaseous disk embedded in a spherical dark matter halo. The density profile of\nthe NFW (Navarro, Frenk & White 1997) halo is adiabatically contracted due to baryonic cooling (Springel & White\n1999). Stars and cold (T = 104 K) gas in the disk follow the\nsame exponential surface density profile of the form\n\u03a3(R) =\n\nMd\nexp (\u2212R/Rd ) ,\n2\u03c0Rd 2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Md and Rd are the disk mass and radial scale length\n(in cylindrical coordinates) respectively, while the thin vertical structure is characterised by the scale height zd \u223c 15 Rd :\n\u03c1d (R, z) =\n\n\u03a3(R)\nsech2 (z/zd ) .\n2zd\n\n(2)\n\nThe MW model comprises of two further components: a stellar bulge and an extended hot gaseous halo. The bulge has\na spherical Hernquist (Hernquist 1990) profile:\n\u03c1b (r) =\n\nMb\nrb\n2\u03c0 r(rb + r)3\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Mb is the bulge mass and rb its scale length.\nAlthough the presence of an extended corona of hot\ngas seems to be the most likely explanation for the detection of OVI and OVII absorption lines associated with\nHI structures (MS, some HVCs, Outer Spiral Arm, Complex A, Complex C, according to Sembach et al. 2003),\nits density structure is still uncertain, particularly at large\ndistances from the Galactic center. These ionization features suggest a mean density of the gaseus halo within 80\nkpc of \u223c 10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22125 cm\u22123 (Sembach 2003). Stanimirovic\n(2002) provides similar values for the density at 45 kpc\n\u22124\n\u22123\n(nh <\n\u223c3 \u00d7 10 cm ) in order to explain the confinement\nmechanism of the MS clouds through pressure support from\nthe hot halo. Another constraint comes from the detection of\n\n\fThe interacting LMC-MW system\nH\u03b1 emission along the MS which cannot be explained solely\nby photoionisation from the Galactic disk (Putman et al.\n2003b) and could be induced by the interaction with a relative dense (nh > 10\u22124 cm\u22123 at 50 kpc) gaseous environment (Weiner & Williams 1996). With a density higher than\n10\u22124 cm\u22123 Quilis & Moore (2001) are able to reproduce, using hydrodynamical simulations, the head-tail structure and\nthe compression fronts associated with HVCs, in the case of\neither pure gas clouds or gas embedded within a dark matter\nhalo. A significantly lower value for the upper limit of the\nhalo density (nh < 10\u22125 cm\u22123 ) is found by Murali (2000)\nby requiring the survival of the cloud MS IV for 500 Myrs\nagainst evaporation. However we emphasise the fact that\nthe evaporation time strongly depends on the temperature\nof the gaseous halo (Cowie & McKee 1977) and a choice of\nT \u223c 106 K, three times lower than the value used by Murali, increases by almost a factor fifteen the lifetime of MS\nIV, making the survival of the cloud possible at a density\nof even 10\u22124 cm\u22123 . At larger distances from the Galactic\ncenter constraints on the halo density are poor, although\nBlitz & Robishaw (2000) derive a value of 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm\u22123\nat a distance of 200 kpc by applying ram pressure stripping\nto dwarf spheroidal galaxies within the Galactic halo.\nWe model the hot halo with a spherical distribution of\ngas which traces the dark matter profile within the virial radius and is in hydrostatical equilibrium inside the Galactic\npotential. Assuming an isotropic model, the halo temperature at a given radius r is determined by the cumulative\nmass distribution M (r) of the dark, stellar and gaseous components of the MW beyond r and by the density profile \u03c1h (r)\nof the hot gas:\nT (r) =\n\nmp 1\nkB \u03c1h (r)\n\nZ\n\nr\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03c1h (r)\n\nGM (r)\ndr ,\nr2\n\n3\n\nFigure 1.

The halo gas is completely ionised\nat a mean temperature of 106 K. We normalise the density\nprofile using a hot halo mass of Mh = 1010 M\u2299 , which corresponds to a mean density of 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm\u22123 within 150 kpc\nand 8.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 at 50 kpc. With the assumption that the gas\ntraces the dark matter we overestimate by a factor of three\nthe ionised gas density near the disk, however this is not\nimportant for the current study.\nThe masses and the scale lengths of the MW and\nLMC models (Table 1) are selected in order to reproduce observational constraints from Kim et al. (1998) and\nvan der Marel et al. (2002), while for the MW we adopt a\nmodel similar to model A1 of Klypin, Zhao & Somerville\n(2002).

The high resolution runs\nhave 2.46 \u00d7 106 particles, of which 3.5 \u00d7 105 are used for\nthe disks and 5 \u00d7 105 for the hot halo of the MW (Table\n1). The gravitational spline softening is set equal to 0.5 kpc\nfor the dark and gaseous halos, and to 0.1 kpc for stars and\ngas in the disk and bulge components.\n\n3\n\nTEST SIMULATIONS\n\nThe mass resolution of the simulations strongly influences\nthe ram pressure process. In particular, if the particles of\nthe hot external medium are too massive, they do not flow\nsmoothly on to the disk, but produce scattering and numerical holes, increasing the stripping process which is dominated by noise. In order to study these effects, we perform\nseveral test simulations in which we place the model LMC\ngalaxy within a \"wind tunnel\" and vary the mass of the hot\nhalo particles for a fixed resolution of the LMC disk.\nThe first set (H1, H2 and H3) of runs simulates the\npassage of the satellite at the perigalacticon, which is the\npoint along the orbit where ram pressure is most efficient due\nto the high values of \u03c1g and v. The volume of the simulations\nis an oblong of base equal to the diameter of the LMC and\nheight h = vt, where v is the velocity of the satellite at\nthe perigalacticon (250 km s\u22121 ) and t is set \u223c 2 Gyrs (\u223c the\ninferred orbital time for the LMC). We represent the hot gas\nas a flux of particles moving with a velocity v along the z\naxis, parallel to the angular momentum of the disk. The hot\nparticles have an initial random distribution, a temperature\nT = 106 K and a number density nh = 8 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm\u22123 . The\nbox has periodic boundary conditions in order to restore the\nflow of hot gas that leaves the oblong. The disk particles have\nthe same mass mdisk as in the high resolution interacting\nruns (see Table 2), while the mass ratio with the particles\nin the oblong mh /mdisk of 1:10, 1:2 and 1:1. Gas is removed\nfrom the disk if the ram pressure produced by the hot halo\nof the MW is greater than the restoring force per unit area\nprovided by the disk of the satellite. The condition for ram\npressure stripping is expressed by (Gunn & Gott 1972)\n\u03c1h v 2 > 2\u03c0G\u03a3(R)\u03a3g (R),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the galaxy with respect to the surrounding medium, \u03c1h is the density of the hot halo of the\nMW and \u03a3g (r) is the cold gas surface density at the radius\nR. \u03a3 represents the gravitational surface mass density of the\ndisk. The minimum radius given by Equation (7) is the final\nstripping radius Rstr beyond which the ISM can be removed\nfrom the galaxy. The halo component does not contribute\nto the restoring force initially, since in the case of a face\non impact any force associated to a spherical potential is\nperpendicular to the wind pressure. As the gas is stripped\nout from the disk in the z direction, the disk gravity decreases while the projection of the radial halo gravity force\nin the z direction rises (Schulz & Struck 2001). This effect\nis particularly important in the case of low ram pressure\nregimes as the ones we are interested in here. The condition\n\nfor stripping expressed in Equation (7) implicitly assumes\ninstantaneous stripping from the disk and discrete ram pressure stripping events such that the loss of mass approaches\nan asymptotic limit. If instead ram pressure is a continuous\nprocess with time scales comparable with the orbital time\nof the satellite, the stripping radius calculated analytically\nunderestimates the physical size of the gaseous disk. Such a\ncontinuous ram pressure stripping occurs here not because\nof turbulent or viscous stripping but because the gas at the\nedge of the disk heats up responding to the compression\nexerted by the outer medium and can therefore become unbound by increasing its energy despite the ram pressure wind\nbeing constant. Timescales of both Kelvin-Helmoltz instabilities and artificial viscous forces are close to 10 Gyr because\nof, respectively, stabilization due to the cuspy halo potential\nof the LMC and the high mass resolution employed, and are\ntherefore negligible over the timescales explored here.\nWe estimate Rstr as the radius which contains 99% of\nthe gas particles in the midplane of the disk. The mass of\ngas that remains in the disk can be computed summing the\ndisk particles inside a cylinder of radius Rstr and thickness\n1 kpc. The mass of gas bound to the satellite at a time t is\ninstead not directly related to Rstr , but is determined by the\npotential of the dark halo. We calculate it balancing kinetic,\nthermal and potential energy in concentric spherical shells\ncentered on the LMC, defining the gas tidal radius rg as the\nradius of the most distant bound shell.\nThe mass of cold gas stripped from the LMC's disk mstr\ndecreases as we decrease the mass of the halo particles: in\nH1 mstr is \u223c 1.6 times larger than in H3 (Table 2). Mass\nresolution also determinates the shape of the front edge and\ninfluences the morphology of the gaseous disk. Fig. 3 shows\nthe gas density in the disk after 2 Gyrs for the H1, H2 and\nH3 runs. Numerical effects in the low resolution run are quite\nevident: the massive hot particles produce particle \u2013 particle interactions with gas in the galaxy, creating holes and\ndiscontinuities along the front edge of the disk. The spiral\npattern is partially destroyed and the disk looses its symmetry. Scattering reduces the stripping radius by a factor of 1.4\nand produces a sharp truncation, while the effect of pure ram\npressure is much more gradual, since halo particles stream\naround the disk. Finally, the removed gas forms an asymmetric and turbulent tail. The high resolution H3 run appears\nvery symmetric with a flat and uniform edge and a regular stream, which flows around the disk and creates a low\ndensity region behind (Fig. 4). As previously noticed by several authors (Quilis, Moore & Bower 2000; Quilis & Moore\n2001; Schulz & Struck 2001), a bow shock forms in front of\nthe disk, increasing the local ICM temperature from 106 to\n2.5 \u00d7 106 degrees. The intermediate run H2 is similar to H1,\nalthough the gas tail is more pronounced and the amount of\nstripped gas is less than 10% larger. The resolution (mass ratio of 1:2) of the H2 run is to be a good compromise between\nthe necessity of solving the gas dynamics and the number of\nparticles to use in a full production simulation.\nThe runs L1, L2 and L3 have a gas density (\u03c1h =\n3.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm\u22123 ) and satellite velocity (175 km s\u22121 ) similar to our final LMC's orbit with apocentric distance \u223c 50\nkpc and apo/peri ratio \u223c 2.5 : 1 (see section 4.1). Reducing\nthe ram pressure by a factor of three decreases the stripped\nmass by \u223c 20%, while the amount of unbound gas is almost 60% smaller. This indicates that a lower ram pressure\n\n\fThe interacting LMC-MW system\n\n5\n\nTable 2. LMC wind tunnel simulations.

The simulations were computed using three different resolutions, with mh /hdisk equal to 2, 1 and 0.5. The\nstripped mass converges for mh /mdisk < 1.\nThe dependence of ram pressure on the satellite orientation is not a simple function of the angle between the disk plane and the orbital velocity\n(Vollmer et al. 2001) and can depend on the ram pressure\nand the structure of the satellite (Abadi, Moore & Bower\n1999; Quilis, Moore & Bower 2000; Schulz & Struck 2001;\nMarcolini, Brighenti & D'Ercole 2003).

Orbital separation for the MW \u2013 LMC system\n\nFigure 6. Final LMC rotation curve.\n\nL1, it is clear that the stripping is not very sensitive to\ndisk orientation. This implies that the amount of gas in the\nStream will only slightly depend on the initial inclination of\nthe LMC disk and on the precession eventually induced by\ntidal forces from the MW.\n\nlite is currently at 50 kpc from the Galactic center and is\nmoving away from the perigalacticon (at 45 kpc) with a velocity of 250 km s\u22121 . From the plot it appears evident that\nthe orbit is slowly sinking, with each apogalactic distance\n\u223c 20% smaller than the previous one. We will show in the\nnext subsection that the change in the orbital parameters\ndue to dynamical friction strongly affects the tidal forces\nand rate of ram pressure stripping.\nIn choosing the initial inclination and position of the\nline of nodes we make the approximation that they do not\nchange during the interaction. In particular we adopt the\nvalues from van der Marel et al. (2002): respectively i =\n34.7\u25e6 and \u0398 = 129.9\u25e6 . This choice could partially influence\nthe final stellar structure of the disk, but not the ram pressure stripping process, as seen in the previous section.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nINTERACTING RUNS\nOrbital parameters\n\nThe morphology of the Stream indicates that the orbit of the\nLMC is nearly polar and counter\u2013clockwise, as seen from the\nSun, while kinematical data (van der Marel et al. 2002) imply that the present position at \u223c 50 kpc from the Galactic\nCenter, is close to the perigalacticon. Since the mass ratio\nbetween the MW and its satellite is about 50:1, we expect\nthat the effects of the dynamical friction are not negligible\non time scales comparable with the orbital period. On the\nother hand, at each pericentric passage the LMC loses mass\nfrom tidal stripping, increasing its decay time: dynamical\nfriction becomes less effective as the satellite approaches the\nGalaxy (Colpi, Mayer & Governato 1999).\nDynamical friction implies that we can not precisely make a backwards integration of the LMC's orbit, therefore we make several low resolution test simulations (3 \u00d7 105 particles) in order to find the correct starting point for the LMC 4 Gyrs in the past such that it\nends up with the present distance, velocity and orientation on the sky. We find orbital parameters close to the\nones obtained by Gardiner, Sawa, & Fujimoto (1994) and\nGardiner & Noguchi (1996). In particular the orbital plane\nis perpendicular to the Galactic disk, the present eccentricity (defined as (rapo \u2212 rper )/(rapo + rper ), with rapo and rper\napogalacticon and perigalacticon distances) and the orbital\nperiod are respectively 0.44 and \u223c 2 Gyrs. The orbital separation between the MW and the LMC is plotted in Fig. 5\nfor the past 4 Gyrs and 4 Gyrs into the future. The satel-\n\n4.2\n\nThe Stream\n\nThe close interaction with the MW strongly perturbs the\nentire structure of the satellite. In particular during the 4\nGyrs preceding the present epoch the LMC loses \u223c 80% of\nits dark halo, and is currently tidally truncated at a radius\nof 11 kpc, consistent with the values provided by analytic\ncalculations (Weinberg 2000; van der Marel et al. 2002) and\nwith observations of the outer regions of the disk (Irwin\n1991; van der Marel 2001). The contribution of the dark\nmatter halo to the final rotation curve within 8 kpc from\nthe center decreases by \u223c 5 km s\u22121 and the disk component\npredominates in the inner region (Fig. 6).\nWhile all the stars within the tidal radius are likely to\nbe gravitationally bound, this is not true for gas. In fact,\npart of the gas that lies within the tidal radius can have\nenough thermal energy to escape from the potential well of\nthe galaxy. Fig. 7 illustrates the evolution of the baryonic\nmass as function of time. The dotted and solid curve refers\nto the stellar and gaseus component respectively while the\ndashed curve represents the gas within the tidal radius which\nis actually bound to the LMC.\n\n\fThe interacting LMC-MW system\n\nFigure 7. Fraction of stars and gas bound to the satellite during the last 4 Gyrs. Both the gas within the tidal radius and\nthe bound gas are plotted. Mi is the initial mass of each disk\ncomponent. The vertical solid lines indicate the perigalactica.\n\nAfter two perigalactic passages the satellite looses\nroughly \u223c 12% of its gas and \u223c 4% of stars. A pure tidal\nstripping model would remove similar amounts of both stars\nand gas unless the initial gas disk was significantly more extended. The larger amount of stripped gas is due primarily to ram\u2013pressure stripping: the rate at which gas is lost\nincreases as the LMC approaches perigalacticon (the solid\nvertical lines in the plot), corresponding to higher densities\nof the diffuse halo gas and to higher velocities of the satellite\nalong the orbit.\nStars are stripped from the LMC only during the last\nperigalacticon, since the previous perigalactic passage is too\nfar from the MW to produce significative tidal shocks and\nto perturb the stellar structure of the satellite. The present\nstellar distribution (Fig. 8) indicates that a trailing and a\nsmall leading arm are forming (with surface density \u223c 3 \u00d7\n10\u22123 M\u2299 pc\u22122 ), but most of the stars stripped from the disk\nare still bound to the LMC and form a large spheroidal\ncomponent.\nContrary to the stars, gas is stripped during the first\npassage at perigalacticon, forming a continuous stream that\nlies in a thin plane (width \u223c 25 kpc) perpendicular to the\ndisk of the MW (Fig. 9) and between 50 and 75 kpc from the\nGalactic center. Our simulations predict that the MS forms a\ngreat circle, but most of the gas is lost recently and it is now\nat an angular distance between 10\u25e6 and 120\u25e6 from the LMC\n(comparable with the range provided by observations). The\nmass of the stripped gas (1.4 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 ) is of the same order\nof magnitude as the observed amount of neutral hydrogen\nin the Stream by Putman et al. (2003a) (2 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 ).\nFig. 10 represents the projection of the Stream as seen\nfrom an observer situated at the Galactic center who is looking toward the South Galactic Pole. The logarithmic colour\nscale indicates the column density gradient which gradually\ndecreases along the length of the Stream. At a fixed distance\n\n7\n\nFigure 8. Present day distribution of stars from the LMC disk\nin a plane perpendicular to the Galactic plane.\n\nFigure 9. Final distribution of gas from the LMC disk in a plane\nperpendicular to the Galactic plane\n\nfrom the LMC the structure of the Stream is not uniform but\nhas clumpy and high density regions. The decrease in density is by nearly two orders of magnitude along the Stream\n(Fig. 11), due to the combination of two factors. The gas\nclose to the head of the Stream is pulled from the disk during the last perigalacticon, when the stripping rate is maximum, whereas the tip is \u223c 1 Gyr old and corresponds to an\napogalactic passage. Moreover, the tail is formed by the first\nmaterial stripped from the outer and low density regions of\nthe exponential disk. This decrease in column density is a\nremarkable success for the ram-pressure scenario since tidal\n\n\f8\n\nC. Mastropietro et al.\n\nFigure 11. Hydrogen column density along the Stream. The system of coordinates is chosen in order to have the LMC at 0 degrees.\n\nthe Northern Galactic hemisphere, intersecting the actual\nposition of the satellite.\nThe total amount of unbound gas after 4 Gyrs is comparable with the gas stripped in one orbital time from an\nLMC model in a test tube simulation with densities and velocities characteristic of a perigalactic passage. This means\nthat the tidal forces acting on the satellite contribute to ram\npressure processes: as a consequence of the resulting asymmetrical potential and distorted stellar disk, it is easier to\nstrip more gas from the LMC's disk since the gravitational\nrestoring force is weaker. Thus even a low density gaseus\nGalactic halo is able to remove a significant amount of gas\nfrom the LMC.\n4.2.1\n\nFigure 10. Hydrogen column density along the simulated stream.\nThe intensity values are on a logarithmic scale with white corresponding to the highest density regions within the LMC disk and\ndark blue to nH \u223c 1018 cm\u22122 .\n\nmodels generically produce streams with surface densities\nthat fall off much more slowly.\nThe difference in the characteristic time scales of hydrodynamical and gravitational forces explains why a gaseous\nleading arm does not form through tidal stripping: gas is\nremoved quite early from the outer regions of the LMC disk\nthat during the second passage at the perigalacticon starts\nforming a leading arm feature. The great circle of stripped\ngas actually appears on the sky as a leading stream and\ncould in principle reproduce observations of the leading arm\n(Fig. 9). This material was stripped from the satellite during the first orbit and is falling to the Galactic center in\n\nAdiabatic versus cooling runs\n\nWe have presented results from simulations that do not include radiative cooling. As discussed in section 3, in this\ncase the gas in the disk of the LMC will increase its temperature as it is strongly compressed by the outer medium.\nIn the adiabatic regime the gas can only lose energy by expansion, which requires a long timescale, and can become\neasily unbound due to this input of thermal energy. We have\nrun a simulation with radiative cooling adopting a standard\ncooling function for primordial gas (hydrogen and helium).\nSince the gas quickly heats up to \u223c 105 K, the peak of the\ncooling curve, then cools down on a timescale much shorter\nthan the dynamical time, shrinking in radius compared to\nits original location. As a result a smaller gaseous disk results after a few cycles of heating and rapid cooling which\nsits deeper in the potential well and as a result no gas is\nstripped. However, what we are witnessing is probably the\nresult of overcooling since we are neglecting the effect of\nstar formation, namely heating from supernovae feedback\nand radiation from massive stellar associations. The LMC\nin particular shows widespread intense star formation across\n\n\fThe interacting LMC-MW system\n\n9\n\nits disk and bar. In reality a multi-phase ISM will result that\nwill be eventually close to the condition of pressure equilibrium with the outer medium and will not be able to cool so\nefficiently. Until we can effectively model this multi-phase\nmedium, we believe that the results of the adiabatic simulations are closer to reality.\n\n4.3\n\nThe LMC disk\n\nThe Galactic disk remains unperturbed during the interaction, while the morphology of the satellite changes drastically. In particular we will focus on the changes in the stellar\nand gaseous structure of the LMC.\nAfter 4 Gyrs from the beginning of the simulations almost the entire stellar component is still bound to the satellite, but less than 90% of the stars lies in the thin disk, which\nis surrounded by a stellar spheroid with a radius of \u223c 11\nkpc (Fig. 12). The structure of this spheroidal component is\nquite complex, since a strong warp that wraps 180\u25e6 around\nthe LMC is superimposed on the underlying low density\nstellar distribution. The warp forms after the first passage\nat the perigalacticon and involves a large fraction of the stellar particles. It extends up \u223c 5 kpc out of the thin disk and\nis aligned with the major axis of the satellite. The existence\nof a warp is inferred by Kim et al. (1998) from the gas velocity field in the disk of the LMC, by van der Marel & Cioni\n(2001) and Olsen & Salyk (2002) using the apparent magnitude of different classes of stars as a distance indicator.\nThe diffuse spheroidal component has an average surface\ndensity of \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22122 M\u2299 pc\u22122 , which becomes one order\nof magnitude larger if we consider only the warp region.\nThe warp deformation is partially directed along the line\nof sight and could have implications for the microlensing\nresults, increasing the optical depth caused by self\u2013lensing\n(Zaritsky & Lin 1997; Zhao & Evans 2000). The LMC's disk\nappears elongated, with a mean ellipticity \u01eb = 0.38 (where\n\u01eb = 1 \u2212 q and q is the axial ratio), in a direction roughly\naligned with the Galactic center and perpendicular to the\nStream. These values agree very well with the observations\nprovided by van der Marel (2001). Within the inner 6\u20137 kpc\nof the model LMC a strong and asymmetric bar forms after\nthe first perigalacticon.\nThe isodensity contours of the face-on disk were fitted\nwith ellipses using the MIDAS task FIT/ELL3. The ellipse\ncenters, ellipticity and major axis position angle were considered as free parameters of the fitting procedure. The results of this projected analysis are illustrated in Fig. 13. The\nfirst plot on the top (solid line) shows the B-band surface\nbrightness profile of the present face-on LMC, for which the\nbest fitting exponential curve has a scale length of 1.5 kpc.\nThe dashed line is the original exponential disk, with a scale\nlength of \u223c 1.7 kpc. The second and the third plot illustrate\nthe variation of the position angle and eccentricity as a function of radius. The position angle is almost constant in the\ncentral 4 kpc of the disk and presents a sharp twist beyond\nthis radius, which corresponds to the transition between the\nbar region and the outer density contours characterized by\nellipticities <\n\u223c 8 kpc the disk appears more\n\u223c0.2.

The\npeak in the velocity dispersion in the central 6\u20138 kpc is\nmainly due to the bar formation, while the external regions\nappear to be dominated by an hot tidally perturbed component with \u03c3p \u223c 20 km s\u22121 .\nThe gaseous disk is completely dominated by stripping\nprocesses (Fig 15). It retains a symmetric structure only\nwithin the central 12 kpc, in connection with the thin component of the stellar disk. Within this radius we do not observe a significative displacement between the center of the\nstellar distribution and the gaseus disk. The ram pressure\nstripping radius after 4 Gyrs is \u223c 6 kpc, a factor of three\nsmaller than the initial disk radius and compatible with the\nresults provided by HIPASS data (Putman, Gibson & Smith\n1998).\n\n5\n\nFigure 13.

The last\nplot on the bottom represents the drift of the ellipse center in the\nplane of the disk.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have carried out high resolution gravitational/hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction\nbetween the LMC and Milky Way. As the LMC spirals\ninwards towards the Galaxy it suffers ever increasing\ngravitational tidal forces and hydrodynamical stripping.\nOur simulations cover the previous 4 Gyrs of the orbit of\nthe LMC such that at the final time it ends up at its correct\nlocation within the Galactic halo and with the observed\ninclination. We find that the combined effects of gravity\nand ram-pressure stripping can account for the majority of\nthe LMC's kinematical and morphological features and the\nmorphology of Magellanic Stream.\nOur model of the hot gaseous halo places a total of\n\n\fThe interacting LMC-MW system\n\n11\n\n109 M\u2299 of ionised hydrogen within the dark matter halo of\nthe Galaxy. The density at 50 kpc is \u2248 8 \u00d7 10\u22125 atoms/cm3 .\nThis is sufficient to remove over 108 M\u2299 of gas from the\nLMC, close to the observed mass of the Stream. The stripped\ngas forms a great circle, or a polar ring, around the Galaxy,\nconsistently with the recently discovered extension of the\nStream into the Northern Hemisphere by Braun & Thilker\n(2004). Less material was stripped during the pericentric\npassage 4 Gyrs ago since dynamical friction has moved the\nClouds closer today. Thus we can reproduce the observed\ndecrease in column density along the Stream. Very few stars\nare tidally removed from the LMC, but its disk becomes\nseverely warped due to the tidal interaction. This creates\na diffuse halo of stars within the LMC that may have been\nobserved as self-lensing events. The disk of stars is elongated\nby 2:1 oriented towards the Galactic centre in agreement\nwith the observations of van der Marel (2001).\nSeveral improvements to our simulations could be made\nin order to study this fascinating interacting system in more\ndetail. More detailed modelling of the star-formation and\ninternal ISM of the LMC is necessary in order to study the\nrole of gas stripping on star-formation, and the role of starformation and the multiphase ISM on the stripping process.\nIncluding the interaction with the SMC which could supply a significant amount of gas to the Stream and may be\nresponsible for the Magellanic bridge and the leading arm.\nIncluding a more realistic treatment of the gas physics in order to study the detailed structure of the stripped gas and\nits interaction with the halo gas as it infalls through the\ngalactic halo.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nFigure 15.
