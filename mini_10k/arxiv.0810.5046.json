Both bosonic and fermionic ultracold\nand dilute superfluids can be accurately described by the\nzero-temperature hydrodynamical equations of superfluids [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\nTrapped Bose-Fermi mixtures, with Fermi atoms in a\nsingle hyperfine state (normal Fermi gas), were investigated by various authors both theoretically [6, 7, 8, 9, 10,\n11, 12, 13, 14] and experimentally [15, 16, 17]. Recently,\nthere was a study of a dilute mixture of superfluid bosons\nand fermions across a Feshbach resonance of the FermiFermi scattering length af , obtaining the phase diagram\nof the mixture in a box [18]. In the strict one-dimensional\ncase, we found that the superfluid Bose-Fermi mixture\nexhibits phase separation and solitons by changing the\nBose-Fermi interaction [19, 20].\nIn the present paper we analyze in detail a 3D superfluid Bose-Fermi mixture under harmonic trapping\nconfinement when the Bose-Bose repulsive (positive) and\nFermi-Fermi attractive (negative) scattering lengths are\nvaried from very small (weak coupling) to infinitely large\n(strong coupling) values. The variation of these scattering lengths from weak to strong coupling is achieved in\nlaboratory [21] by varying a background magnetic field\nnear a Feshbach resonance.\nIn the first part of the paper we derive Galilei-invariant\nnonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equations for superfluid Bose and\nFermi dynamics, valid from weak-coupling to unitarity\nin each case, which are equivalent to the hydrodynam-\n\n\u2217 adhikari@ift.unesp.br;\n\u2020 salasnich@pd.infn.it;\n\nURL www.ift.unesp.br/users/adhikari\nURL www.padova.infm.it/salasnich\n\nical equations. For bosons the equation is a generalized [22, 23, 24] zero-temperature Gross-Pitaevskii (GP)\nequation [25] including beyond-mean-field corrections to\nincorporate correctly the effect of bosonic interaction for\nlarge and positive (repulsive) scattering lengths ab . In\nthe ordinary GP equation the nonlinear term is linearly\nproportional to ab and hence highly overestimates the\neffect of bosonic interaction for large positive values of\nab . In fact there is a saturation of bosonic interaction in the so-called unitarity ab \u2192 +\u221e limit, properly taken care of in the present generalized GP equations. For superfluid fermions the present formulation is\nbased on the density-functional (DF) theory [26, 27] for\nfermion pairs [23, 28, 29, 30, 31] including beyond-meanfield corrections to incorporate properly the effect of\nfermionic attraction between spin-up and down fermions\nspecially for large negative (attractive) values of FermiFermi scattering length af . The DF theory, in different\nforms, has already been applied to the problem of ultracold fermions [32, 33]. The usual DF equation is valid\nfor the weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schreiffer (BCS)\nlimit: af \u2192 \u22120. The present generalized DF equation\ncorrectly accounts for the dynamics as the Fermi-Fermi\nattraction is varied from the weak-coupling BCS limit\nto unitarity: af \u2192 \u2212\u221e. In the unitarity limit there is\na saturation of the effect of fermion interaction, properly taken care of in the present set of equations, which\nseems to be appropriate to study the crossover [34] from\nthe weak coupling BCS limit to the molecular Bose limit.\nIn the second part of the paper, by including the interaction between a boson and fermion pair, we obtain a set\nof coupled equation for superfluid Bose-Fermi dynamics\nin the presence of a Bose-Fermi interaction. The model\ncorrectly describes the dynamics as the Bose-Bose repulsion and Fermi-Fermi attraction are varied from weakcoupling to unitarity. This model is tested numerically\nas the different scattering lengths are varied over wide\nranges covering the weak-coupling to unitarity transition\n\n\f2\nfor a superfluid Bose-Fermi mixture.\nIn Sec. II we present the hydrodynamical equations for\nbosons and fermions and present the appropriate bulk\nchemical potentials valid in the weak-coupling limit as\nwell as possessing the saturation in the strong-coupling\nunitarity limit consistent with the constraints of quantum\nmechanics. In Sec. III we derive mean-field equations for\nbosons and fermions consistent with the hydrodynamical equations for a large number of atoms. Next we\nderive the present model for interacting Bose-Fermi superfluid introducing a contact interaction between bosons\nand fermions. In Sec. IV we perform numerical calculations for densities and chemical potentials of a trapped\nBose-Fermi superfluid mixture to show the advantage of\nthe present model. Finally, in Sec. V we present a brief\nsummary and conclusion.\n\nII.\n\nSUPERFLUID HYDRODYNAMICS FOR\nBOSONS AND FERMIONS\n\nAt zero temperature, for a large number of atoms,\nstatical and dynamical collective properties of bosonic\nand fermionic superfluids are expected to be properly\ndescribed by the hydrodynamical equations of superfluids [1, 2]. For bosons the hydrodynamical equations are\ngiven by [1, 3]\n\u2202\nnb + \u2207 * (nb vb ) = 0 ,\n(1)\n\u2202t\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n\u2202\nmb vb + \u2207 mb vb2 + Ub + \u03bcb (nb , ab ) = 0 , (2)\n\u2202t\n2\nwhere Ub (r) is the external potential acting on bosons,\nmb is the mass of a bosonic atom, nb (r, t) is the local density of bosons, and vb (r, t) is the local superfluid velocity\n[1, 2, 3]. The total number of bosons is given by\nZ\nNb = nb (r, t) d3 r ,\n(3)\nand the nonlinear term \u03bcb (nb , ab ) is the bulk chemical\npotential of the bosonic system with ab the Bose-Bose\nscattering length. Equation (1) is the equation of continuity of hydrodynamic flow, while Eq. (2) is the equation\nof conservation of the linear momentum. Equation (2) establishes the irrotational nature of the superfluid motion:\n\u2207 \u2227 vb = 0, meaning that the velocity vb can be written\nas the gradient of a scalar field. Equations (1) and (2)\ndiffer from the corresponding equations holding in the\ncollisional regime of a non-superfluid system because of\nthe irrotationality constraint.\nFor superfluid fermions, the fundamental entity governing the superfluid flow is the Cooper pair. In the\ncase of a two-component (spin up and down) superfluid\nFermi system one can introduce the local density of pairs\nnp (r, t) = nf (r, t)/2, where nf (r, t) is the total local\ndensity of fermions. The hydrodynamical equations of\n\na fermionic superfluid [2, 3, 4, 5] can be written as\n\u2202\nnp + \u2207 * (np vp ) = 0 ,\n(4)\n\u2202t\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n\u2202\nmp vp + \u2207 mp vp2 + Up + \u03bcp (np , af ) = 0 , (5)\n\u2202t\n2\nwhere the nonlinear term \u03bcp (np , af ) is the bulk chemical potential of pairs with af the attractive Fermi-Fermi\nscattering length. Here mp is the mass of a pair, that is\ntwice the mass mf of a single fermion, i.e. mp = 2mf . In\naddition, the trap potential Up (r) is twice the trap potential Uf (r) acting on a single fermion, i.e. Up (r) = 2Uf (r).\nNote that the chemical potential \u03bcp (np , af ) is twice the\ntotal chemical potential \u03bcf (nf , af ) of the Fermi system,\ni.e. \u03bcp (np , af ) = 2\u03bcf (2np , af ). The total number Nf of\nfermions is\nZ\nZ\nNf = 2Np = 2 np (r) d3 r = nf (r) d3 r ,\n(6)\nwhere Np is the number of pairs.\nIt is important to stress that Eqs. (1) and (2) are\nformally similar to Eqs. (4) and (5), but the quantities\ninvolved are strongly different. In particular, the bulk\nchemical potential of bosons is completely different from\nthe bulk chemical potential of Fermi pairs [1, 2, 35].\nIn the full crossover from the small-gas-parameter\nregime to the large-gas-parameter regime we use the following expression for the bulk chemical potential of the\nBose superfluid [22]\nh\u03042 2/3\n1/3\nn f (nb ab ) ,\nmb b\n\n(7)\n\nx + \u03b1x5/2\n.\n1 + \u03b3x3/2 + \u03b2x5/2\n\n(8)\n\n\u03bcb (nb , ab ) =\nwhere\nf (x) = 4\u03c0\n\nIn the small-gas-parameter (x \u2192 0) regime, Eq. (8) becomes\nh\ni\nf (x) = 4\u03c0 x + (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3)x5/2 + ... ,\n(9)\nwhich is the analytical result for bulk chemical potential\nfound by Lee, Yang, and Huang\n\u221a [36, 37] in this limit,\nprovided that (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3) = 32/(3 \u03c0). In Eq. (8) we shall\nalso choose \u03b2 = 4\u03c0\u03b1/\u03b7, with \u03b7 = 22.22; this will make\nthe bulk chemical potential (7) satisfy the correct unitar2/3\nity limit \u03bcb (nb , ab ) = 22.22h\u03042 nb /mb as established by\nCowell et al. [38]. Hence Eqs. (7) with (8) can be made\nto satisfy the correct weak-coupling and unitarity limits.\nNext we need to determine\n\u221a the constants \u03b1 and \u03b3 consistent with (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3) = 32/(3 \u03c0). We consider the following\nthree choices\npossible many choices:\n\u221a for \u03b1 and \u03b3 from a \u221a\n\u03b1 = 32\u03bd/(3 \u03c0), \u03b3 = 32(\u03bd \u2212 1)/(3 \u03c0) with (a) \u03bd = 1.05,\n(b) \u03bd = 1.1, and (c) \u03bd = 1.15. All three choices are consistent with the unitarity and the Lee-Yang-Huang limits\n\n\f3\nThe hydrodynamical equations are valid to describe\nequilibrium properties and dynamical properties of longwavelength for both bosons and fermions. In particular,\none can introduce [1, 2] a healing (or coherence) length\nsuch that the transport phenomena under investigation\nmust be characterized by a length scale much larger than\nthe healing length. As suggested by Combescot, Kagan\nand Stringari [44], the healing length can be defined for\nbosons as\n\ncr\n\nvb (nb,ab)\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n012\n\n1\n\n8\n\n4\nnb\n\n0 2\n\nab\n\n\u03beb =\nvbcr\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) The critical sound velocity\nof a\nuniform Bose superfluid as a function of Bose-Bose scattering\nlength ab and density nb .\n\n[36, 37]. We shall present a critical numerical study of\nthe three choices in the next section.\nIn the full crossover from BCS regime (af \u2192 \u22120) to\nunitarity (af \u2192 \u2212\u221e) we use the following expression for\nthe bulk chemical potential of the Fermi superfluid [39]\n\u03bcp (np , af ) = 2\n\nh\u03042\n(6\u03c0 2 np )2/3 g(21/3 n1/3\np af )\nmp\n\n(10)\n\n\u03b4x\n,\n1 \u2212 \u03bax\n\n(11)\n\nwhere\ng(x) = 1 +\n\nwhere \u03b4 and \u03ba are fitting parameters. The close agreement of the interpolation function g(x) for negative x\nvalues with the results of Monte Carlo calculation of energy of a uniform gas of Fermi superfluid with the parameters \u03b4 = 4\u03c0/(3\u03c0 2 )2/3 , \u03ba = \u03b4/(1 \u2212 \u03b6), and \u03b6 = 0.44\n[40, 41] was established in Ref. [39]. The inclusion\nof the lowest-order term g(x) = 1 in Eq. (10) leads\nto the bulk chemical potential in the absence of FermiFermi interaction (af = 0) of a uniform gas. The nextorder term g(x) = 1 + \u03b4x include known analytical result in the small-gas-parameter regime as obtained by\nLee and Yang [36, 42] and by Galitskii [43].\nThe\nmodel (10) with (11) provides a smooth interpolation\nbetween the bulk chemical potential in the BCS limit\n\u03bcp (np , af ) = 2h\u03042 (6\u03c0 2 np )2/3 /mp + 16\u03c0np h\u03042 af /mp [36] for\n1/3\nsmall np af values and that in the unitarity limit [39]\n1/3\n\u03bcp (np , af ) = 2h\u03042 (6\u03c0 2 np )2/3 \u03b6/mp for large np af values.\nManini and Salasnich [29] and Kim and Zubarev [28] also\nproposed similar interpolation formulas on the basis of\nMonte Carlo data of a uniform Fermi superfluid.\nHere we deal with a Fermi gas in a spherical harmonic\ntrap rather than a uniform Fermi gas. By a direct comparison with the results of Monte Carlo calculation of\na superfluid Fermi gas in a spherical harmonic trap, we\nshall show in Sec. III that Eqs.

However, vbcr increases monotonically with\nnb , whereas vbcr attains a constant value as ab increases.\nThese features are present in the plot of Fig. 1. However,\nthe critical sound velocity vbcr calculated from \u03bcb given\nby Eqs.

(8) in Eq. (7) leads\nto a nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation valid from the weakcoupling to the unitarity limit and is called the unitary\nSchr\u00f6dinger (US) equation for bosons [22].\nIn Fig. 2 we plot the various possibilities for the interpolation function f (x); e.g., those corresponding to the\nUS equation (8) with (a) \u03bd = 1.05, (b) \u03bd = 1.1, and (c)\n\u03bd = 1.15 [as suggested after Eq.

All three choices\n(a), (b), and (c) represent smooth interpolation of f (x)\nbetween small and large x values. For small x this choice\nagrees with the MGP result (21) and for large x with the\nasymptotic result. To test these three choices we actually\nsolve the US Eq. (20), by imaginary time propagation after a Crank-Nicholson discretization [45, 46, 47] (detailed\nin the beginning of Sec. IV), for the trap parameters of a\npossible experimental set up for 87 Rb atoms in a spherical trap and compare the results for energy with those\nobtained by Blume and Greene [48] by diffusion Monte\nCarlo (DMC) method. Actually, we solved Eqs. (20) and\n(7) with nb normalized to (Nb \u22121) in place of Eq. (3), appropriate for a small number of bosons, cf. Eq. (2) of Ref.\n[48]. The energy of the system is calculated through a numerically constructed energy functional from the present\nbulk chemical potential. The calculation is performed\nfor a boson-boson scattering length ab = 0.433l where l\nis the harmonic oscillator length for various Nb and the\nresults for energy are tabulated in Table I. From this\ntable we find that the present US models always provide\na much better approximation to the energies than the\nGP and MGP models. More results of energy for larger\nnumber of bosons may help in fixing the parameters of\nthe present model more accurately.

The fundamental entity responsible for superfluid flow has the mass mp of a pair of fermions. For\npaired fermions in the superfluid state, the order parameter is, apart from a normalization [4, 5, 49], the condensate wave function of the center of mass of the Cooper\npairs:\n\u039ep (r, t) = h\u03c8\u0302\u2191 (r, t)\u03c8\u0302\u2193 (r, t)i ,\n\n0\n0\n\nwhich depends explicitly on the reduced Planck constant\nh\u0304. Neglecting the quantum pressure term, one gets from\nEqs. (22) and (23) the classical hydrodynamical equations (1) and (2). Equation (22) is the continuity equation whereas Eq. (23) establishes the irrotational nature\nof hydrodynamic flow.\nSimilarly, the fermionic superfluid can be described by\na DF [32] complex order parameter \u03a8p (r, t) of pairs, with\na modulus and a phase \u03b8p (r, t) such that\nq\n(25)\n\u03a8p (r, t) = np (r, t) ei\u03b8p (r,t) .\n\nvp =\n\nUS\nFNMC\nGFMC\nLDA\n\n2\n\n(24)\n\n(27)\n\nthat is the average of pair operators, with \u03c8\u0302\u03c3 (r, t) the\nfermionic field operator with spin component \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193 [4,\n23].

The parameter\n\u03ba is always taken as \u03ba = \u03b4/(1 \u2212 \u03b6), \u03b6 = 0.44 [40, 41].\nThe asymptotic limit limx\u2192\u221e g(x) = 0.44 is also shown\nin Fig. 3. The expression (11) represents a good approximation of g(x) for small and large |x|. For small |x| this\nchoice agrees with the MDF result (29) and for large |x|\nwith the asymptotic result for both choices of \u03b4.\n\n\f6\nTo test the above two choices (i) and (ii) of the parameter \u03b4 in Eq. (11) for a Fermi superfluid in a spherical\ntrap, we calculate the energy of the system for different\nvalues of the scattering length af and number of atoms\nNf by solving directly Eq. (28) by imaginary time propagation after a Crank-Nicholson discretization [45, 46, 47]\n(detailed in the beginning of Sec. IV). We also compare\nthe results with those obtained by the fixed-node Monte\nCarlo calculation (FNMC) [50, 51, 52, 53]. The results\nof our investigation are shown in Figs. 4. In Fig. 4\n(a) we plot energy E vs. |af | for Nf = 4 and 8 obtained from a solution the US equation (28) with the\nchoices (i) 4\u03c0/(3\u03c0 2 )2/3 and (ii) 20\u03c0/(3\u03c0 2 )2/3 for \u03b4 and\nthe FNMC data of Ref. [52, 53]. The present hydrodynamical formulation is expected to be good for for a\nlarge number of fermions [see, Fig. 4 (b)], yet for a small\nnumber Nf = 4 the result is reasonable. In Fig. 4 (b)\n2/3\n2/3\nwe plot energy E/Nf vs. Nf at unitarity af \u2192 \u2212\u221e\nobtained from a solution of the US equation (28) with\nchoice (ii) 20\u03c0/(3\u03c0 2 )2/3 for \u03b4. In this limit both choices\nof \u03b4 lead to the same energy. The results of FNMC [50]\nand Green function Monte Carlo (GFMC) [54] calculations as well as of LDA are also shown in Fig. 4 (b).\nThe LDA result is analytically known in this case as\n\u221a\n2/3\nE(N ) = (3Nf )4/3 \u03be/4, \u03be = 0.44 [33]. We plot E/Nf\n2/3\n\nvs. Nf in Fig. 4 (b) because of the linear correlation\nbetween these two variables explicit in the LDA result.\nFrom Figs. 4 we find that the results with choice (ii)\n20\u03c0/(3\u03c0 2 )2/3 of \u03b4 agree well with the Monte Carlo data\nin both cases and this choice will be used in the present\nstudy. The Monte Carlo data clearly favors the present\nmodel over the LDA.\nAgain, inserting Eq. (25) into Eq. (28), after some\nstraightforward algebra equating the real and imaginary\nparts and taking into account Eq. (26), we find two generalized hydrodynamical equations for the Fermi superfluid\n\u2202\nnp + \u2207 * (np vp ) = 0 ,\n(30)\n\u2202t\n\u0014\n\u221a\nmp vp2\n\u2202\nh\u03042 \u22072 np\n+\nmp vp + \u2207 \u2212\n+ Up\n\u221a\n\u2202t\n2mp\nnp\n2\n\u0015\n+ \u03bcp (np , af ) = 0 ,\n(31)\nwhich include the quantum pressure term\nTpQP = \u2212\n\n\u221a\nh\u03042 \u22072 np\n,\n\u221a\n2mp\nnp\n\n(32)\n\ninvolving h\u0304. Neglecting this term leads to the classical hydrodynamical equations (4) and (5) of superfluid Fermi\npairs. This specific quantum pressure term is a consequence of the proper phase-velocity relation (26) with\nthe factor mp in the denominator [2]. Had we taken a\ndifferent mass factor in the denominator, e.g. mf , a different quantum pressure term would have emerged. The\n\npresent choice is physically motivated by Galilei invariance [2, 23, 31] and leads to energies of trapped Fermi\nsuperfluid in close agreement [55] with those obtained\n[50, 54] from the Monte Carlo methods.\nWe stress that, from the point of view of DF theory,\nthe quantum pressure terms for superfluid bosons and\nfermions correspond to gradient correction (also called\nsurface corrections) to the local density approximation\n(LDA), where LDA gives exactly the classical hydrodynamical equations obtained by setting gradient kineticenergy term to zero. The gradient term, which can also\nbe seen as a next-to-leading contribution in a momentum expansion to the classical superfluid hydrodynamics\n[56], takes into account corrections to the kinetic energy\ndue to spatial variations in the density of the system,\nand it is essential to have regular behavior at the surface of the cloud where the density goes to zero [57].\nIn the case of superfluid bosons, the quantum-pressure\nterm, Eq. (24), is exactly the one of the familiar cubic\nGP equation [1, 25]. In the case of superfluid fermions\nthe gradient term is consistent with the motion of paired\nfermions of mass mp = 2mf . For normal fermions various authors have proposed and used different gradient\nterms [57, 58, 59, 60, 61]. For superfluid fermions we are\nusing the familiar von Weizs\u00e4cker term [58] in the case of\npairs. In fact, in our approach, the explicit form of the\nquantum-pressure term, Eq. (32), is strictly determined\nby the Galilei-invariant relation, Eq. (26), between phase\nand superfluid velocity [2, 23, 31]. Finally, we observe\nthat Eq. (32) is practically the same as that recently obtained in Ref. [62] in the case of a superfluid Fermi gas\nat unitarity using an \u01eb expansion around d = 4 \u2212 \u01eb spatial\ndimensions.\nThe generalized hydrodynamical equations (22) and\n(23) for bosons and (30) and (31) for fermions are\nthus completely equivalent to the respective nonlinear\nSchr\u00f6dinger equations (20) and (28). In the limit of zero\nvelocity fields, vb , vp \u2192 0, Eqs. (23) and (31) yield the\nstationary versions of Eqs. (20) and (28) describing the\nsuperfluid densities:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u221a\n\u221a\nh\u03042 2\n\u03bcb0 nb = \u2212\n\u2207 + Ub + \u03bcb (nb , ab )\nnb , (33)\n2mb\n\u0014\n\u0015\nh\u03042 2\n\u221a\n\u221a\nnp , (34)\n\u2207 + Up + \u03bcp (np , af )\n\u03bcp0 np = \u2212\n2mp\nshowing the agreement between hydrodynamical and\nnonlinear equations for superfluid bosons and fermions.\nHere \u03bcb0 and \u03bcp0 are the chemical potentials for bosons\nand fermions in the stationary state.\nAlthough Eq. (34) is written in terms of Fermi pair\ndensity np (and we use this equation in the following),\nan equivalent equation for Fermi density nf (=2np ) can\nbe written as\n\u0015\n\u0014\nh\u03042 2\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03bcf 0 n f = \u2212\n\u2207 + Uf + \u03bcf (nf , af )\nnf , (35)\n8mf\n\u03bcf (nf , af ) =\n\nh\u03042\n1/3\n(3\u03c0 2 nf )2/3 g(nf af ) , (36)\n2mf\n\n\f7\nnb, US\nnp, US\nnb, MGPDF\nnp, MGPDF\nnb, GPDF\nnp, GPDF\nNb=10000\nNp=10000\nabf=100 nm\nab=200 nm\naf=0 nm\n\n0.0008\n\n0.0004\n\n(37)\n\n0\n0\n\nwith j = b, p, (here ap = af , the Fermi-Fermi scattering\nlength) where\nZ nj\n1\n\u03bcj (n\u2032j , aj ) dn\u2032j ,\n(38)\nEj (nj , aj ) =\nnj 0\nis the bulk energy per particle of the superfluid.\nFinally, we introduce a Lagrangian density for BoseFermi interaction to (37) of the form\n\n6\n\n0.0006\n0.0004\n0.0002\n0\n\n(39)\n\nwhere Gbp = 4\u03c0h\u03042 abf /mbf , and mbf is the Bose-Fermi\nreduced mass and abf the Bose-Fermi scattering length.\nWe note that there are no coupling terms between the\nhydrodynamical equations (23) and (31) involving the velocity of two superfluid components. The only coupling\nin the Lagrangian density (39) involves the density of\nthe two superfluid components. However, the present hydrodynamical equations (23) and (31) are a special case\nof the three-fluid (two superfluids and a normal fluid)\nhydrodynamical formulation of Landau and Khalatnikov\n[63] (appropriate for the 4 He-3 He mixture). The Galileiinvariant Landau-Khalatnikov formulation in its general\nform also has a coupling term involving two superfluid velocities (not considered in this paper), as discussed [64]\nby Andreev and Bashkin and also by Ho and Shenoy.\nHowever, the present static model defined by Eqs. (33)\nand (34) is obtained by setting all velocities equal to zero,\nand hence, these terms depending on superfluid velocities\nwould leave the present model unchanged.\nIn this paper we consider abf to have not too large positive values only (moderately repulsive Bose-Fermi interaction.) There are other domains of Bose-Fermi interaction which require special attention. If this interaction\nis attractive and strong enough, then the ground state\nis very different, e.g., the composite fermions f \u0303 = bf\nare created at higher temperatures and at zero temperature we have Cooper pairs (or local pairs) of the type\n< f \u0303 f \u0303 > consisting of two elementary fermions and two\nelementary bosons [65].\nThe complete Lagrangian density given by Eqs.

In this plot nj (r)d3 r = 1.\n\npartial differential equations by discretizing them by the\nsemi-implicit Crank-Nicholson algorithm with imaginary\ntime propagation [45, 46, 47]. The space and time steps\nused in discretization were typically 0.05 and 0.001 respectively.\nAlthough we are not interested here in fitting experimental data, we perform numerical calculation for variables for a possible experimental set up [16] of 87 Rb40\nK mixture in spherical harmonic traps satisfying Ub =\nmb \u03c9b2 r2 /2 = mf \u03c9f2 r2 /2 = Uf with an oscillator length\np\nl = h\u0304/(mb \u03c9b ) = 1 \u03bcm for 87 Rb atoms. The oscillator\nlength for 40 K is modified according to the trap. The\nfermion pair trap in Eq. (41) is Up = mf \u03c9f2 r2 .\nIn Figs. 5 (a) and (b) we plot densities for the superfluid Bose-Fermi mixture as calculated from Eqs. (40)\nand (41) for Nb = 10000, Np = 10000, af = 0, abf = 100\nnm with (a) ab = 200 nm and (b) ab = 2000 nm for\nthe US, MGPDF, and GPDF models. For small ab both\nMGPDF, and GPDF models are good approximations to\nthe bosonic density of the US model (not shown in figure). But as ab increases, the MGPDF model is a better\napproximation to the bosonic density of the US model\nthan the GPDF model as can be seen from Fig. 5 (a).\nHowever, for very large ab , neither the MGPDF nor the\nGPDF model provides the saturation of bulk chemical\npotential for bosons as in the US model. Consequently,\nthe MGPDF, and GPDF models acquire large bosonic\nnonlinearity compared to the US model and hence produce bosonic density extending to larger region in space.\nAs ab is increased, the MGPDF model yields rapidly di-\n\n50\n-1000\n\n-800\n\n-600\n-400\naf (nm)\n\nFIG. 7: (Color online) (a) Chemical potential \u03bcb0 vs. ab of\nEqs.

The chemical potentials are expressed in oscillator unit\nh\u0304\u03c9b .\n\nvergent bosonic nonlinearity (compared to the GPDF\nmodel) and hence produces bosonic density inferior to\nthe GPDF model as can be seen in Fig. 5 (b).\nIn Figs. 6 (a) and (b) we plot superfluid densities\nfor Nb = 100000, Np = 100, abf = 100 nm, ab = 5 nm\nwith (a) af = \u2212100 nm and (b) af = \u2212300 nm for the\nUS, MGPDF, and GPDF models. For small |af | the\nfermionic densities of both MGPDF, and GPDF models\nare good approximation to the US model. But as |af |\nincreases, the GPDF model continues with BCS nonlinearity for af = 0, whereas the fermionic nonlinearity of\nthe MGPDF model acquires excessive attraction. This is\nclear from Figs. 6 (a) and (b) showing a peaked fermionic\ndensity for the MGPDF model for large |af | corresponding to increased attraction. For very large |af |, the MGPDF model does not provide the saturation of fermionic\nbulk chemical potential as in the US model. We note\nthat compared to the study of Figs. 5 with comparable\nnumber of bosons and fermions, in the study of Figs. 6\nwe have much reduced number of fermions compared to\nbosons and the system has undergone a mixing-demixing\ntransition [20, 66] expelling the fermions from the central\nto the peripheral region.\nNext we calculate the chemical potentials \u03bcb0 and \u03bcp0\nof the stationary superfluid Bose-Fermi mixture as described by Eqs. (33) and (34). In Figs. 7 (a) and (b) we\nplot these chemical potentials under the situations described in Figs. 4 and 5, e.g., in the (a) weak-coupling\nBCS limit when ab varies from a small to a large value\n\n\f9\nand (b) weak-coupling GP limit when |af | varies from\na small to a large value, respectively. In the first case\nthe fermionic chemical potential \u03bcp0 remains practically\nconstant over the full range of variation of ab and we plot\nonly the bosonic chemical potential \u03bcb0 in Fig. 7 (a). In\nthe second case bosonic chemical potential \u03bcb0 remains\npractically constant over the full range of variation of af\nand we plot only the fermionic chemical potential \u03bcp0 .\nFrom Fig. 7 (a) we find that, although for small values of ab , the MGPDF model produces results for \u03bcb0 in\nclose agreement with the US model, for medium values\nof ab the GPDF model produces results closer to the US\nmodel. However, for larger values of ab the US model\nshould show saturation, whereas the GPDF chemical potential \u03bcb0 should increase monotonically with ab and\nshould be larger than the the chemical potential of the\nUS model (not shown in figure). From Fig. 7 (b) we find\nthat none of the MGPDF or GPDF models produces reasonable result for \u03bcp0 except for very small values of |af |.\nThe GPDF model does not have a dependence on af and\nhence produces a constant result for \u03bcp0 .\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe dynamics of cold trapped atoms (both bosons and\nfermions) should be correctly handled by a proper treatment of many-body dynamics or through a field-theoretic\nformulation. However, both approaches could be much\ntoo complicated to have advantage in phenomenological application. This is why mean-field approaches are\nwidely used for phenomenological application. In the\nweak-coupling limit, for bosonic atoms the dynamics is\nhandled through the mean-field GP equation [1], whereas\nfor fermionic atoms the LDA (local density approximation) formulation is widely used [2]. The LDA approach\n(often called the Thomas-Fermi approximation) lacks the\nkinetic energy gradient term (quantum pressure term).\nHere we introduce a quantum pressure term consistent\nwith the correct phase-velocity relation of the superfluid\nfermions assuring the Galilei-invariance of the model [23].\nThis modified LDA equation for fermions and the GP\nequation for bosons, both valid in the weak-coupling\nlimit, are both shown to be equivalent to the hydrodynamical equation for superfluid flow.

We introduce proper unitarity saturation effects in these equations. In addition in our Bose-Fermi formulation we\nintroduce a not too strong contact interaction between\nbosons and fermions. The resultant superfluid BoseFermi dynamics is described by a set of coupled partial\ndifferential equation, which is the principal result of this\npaper. In the time-dependent form with a Bose-Fermi\ninteraction this set is described by Eqs. (40) and (41)\nwith the stationary version without Bose-Fermi interaction given by Eqs. (33) and (34).\nThe present model for the superfluid Bose-Fermi mixture is termed the US model, valid in both weak- and\nstrong-coupling unitarity limits for bosons and fermions.\nWe also consider a model called the GPDF model where\nthe boson dynamics is handled by the GP Lagrangian and\nthe fermion dynamics is handled by the LDA formulation\nwith a proper kinetic energy gradient term. Finally, we\nalso consider another model called the MGPDF model including lowest order correction to the GPDF model due\nto the non-zero bosonic and fermionic scattering lengths\nab and |af |. However, the MGPDF model does not provide a saturation of the nonlinear interaction in the unitarity limit when ab and |af | tend to infinity. In our\nnumerical studies of a 87 Rb-40 K mixture in a spherical\nharmonic trap, we find that for medium interactions the\nMGPDF model produces improved results. However, for\nstronger interactions the full US model should be used.\nAlthough, slightly complicated for analytic applications,\nthe present US model is no more complicated than the\nusual GP and LDA equations for numerical treatment\nand is expected to find wide applications in future studies of Bose-Fermi superfluid mixture.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank D.
