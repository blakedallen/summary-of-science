Their constructions have led us to\nconsider the uniqueness of certain associated homotopy types, and our aim is\nto begin that study here; we focus on general issues of formality, and deduce\nthat the rationalisations of a family of special cases are unique. In a sequel [19],\nwe discuss the problem prime by prime, and obtain global results for members\nc Geometry & Topology Publications\n\n\fDietrich Notbohm and Nigel Ray\n\n32\n\nof the family by appeal to Sullivan's arithmetic square. The general problem\nof uniqueness appears to be of considerable difficulty.\nWe work over an arbitrary commutative ring R with identity, and consider a\nuniversal set V of vertices v1 , . . . , vm , ordered by their subscripts. The vertices\nmasquerade as algebraically independent variables, which generate a graded\npolynomial algebra SR (V ) over R. The grading is defined by assigning each of\nthe generators a common dimension, which we usually take to be 2. P\nA function\nM : V \u2192 N is known as a multiset on V , withQcardinality |M | : = j M (vj );\nit may be represented by the monomial vM : = V v M (v) , or by the n-tuple of\nconstituent vertices (vj1 , . . . , vjn ), where j1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 jn and n = |M |. So SR (V )\nis generated additively by the vM , and vM is squarefree precisely when M is\na genuine subset.\nA simplicial complex K on V consists of a finite set of faces \u03c3 \u2286 V , closed with\nrespect to the formation of subsets \u03c1 \u2286Q\u03c3 . Alternatively, we may interpret K as\nthe set of squarefree monomials v\u03c3 : = \u03c3 v , which is closed under factorisation.\nEvery simplicial complex generates a simplicial set K\u2022 ; for each n \u2265 0, the nsimplices Kn contain all M of cardinality n + 1 whose support is a face of K .\nThe face and degeneracy operators delete and repeat the appropriate vertices\nrespectively.\nThe Stanley-Reisner algebra R[K], otherwise known as the face ring of K , is\nan important combinatorial invariant. It is defined as the quotient\nSR (V )/(vU : U \u2208\n/ K),\n\n(1.1)\n\nand is therefore generated additively by the simplices of K\u2022 . The algebraic\nproperties of R[K] encode a host of combinatorial features of K , and are discussed in detail by Bruns and Herzog [3] and Stanley [23], for example. If K is\nthe simplex on V , then R[K] is the polynomial algebra SR (V ).\nFor each K , Davis and Januszkiewicz defined the notion of a toric space over the\ncone on the barycentric subdivision of K , and showed that the cohomology of\nsuch a space is related to R[K]. The relationship follows from their application\nof the Borel construction, which creates a family of spaces whose cohomology\nring (with coefficients in R) is isomorphic to the Stanley-Reisner algebra. All\nmembers of the family are homotopy equivalent to a certain universal example,\nand we refer to any space which shares their common homotopy type as a DavisJanuszkiewicz space. The isomorphisms equip R[K] with a natural grading,\nwhich agrees with that induced from SR (V ). Subsequently, Buchstaber and\nPanov [4] defined a CW-complex whose cohomology ring is also isomorphic to\nR[K]. They confirmed that their complex is a Davis-Januszkiewicz space by\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 5 (2005)\n\n\fHomotopy types, formality and rationalisation\n\n33\n\ngiving an explicit homotopy equivalence with the universal example. In [21],\ntheir space is described as the pointed colimit colim+ B K of a certain cat(K)diagram B K , which assigns the cartesian product B \u03c3 to each face \u03c3 of K .\nHere B denotes the classifying space of the circle, or CP \u221e , and cat(K) is the\ncategory of faces and inclusions.\nWe say that a space X realises the Stanley-Reisner algebra of K whenever there\nis an algebra isomorphism H \u2217 (X; R) \u223c\n= R[K]. We denote the rationalisation\nof X by X0 , and write Autho (X) < Endho (X) for the homotopy classes of\nself-equivalences of X , considered as a subgroup of the homotopy classes of\nself-maps with respect to composition.\nThe contents of each section are as follows.\nIn Section 2 we describe our notation and prerequisites, including those aspects of model category theory which provide a useful context for exponential\ndiagrams and their cohomology. We also explain why it is equally acceptable to work with the unpointed colimit c(K) : = colim B K . We introduce the\nStanley-Reisner algebra in Section 3, and show that the Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence for H \u2217 (c(K); R) collapses by analysing higher limits of certain\ncat(K)-diagrams. In Section 4 we apply similar techniques to prove the formality of the singular cochain algebra C \u2217 (c(K); R). Finally, we specialise to the\ncase R = Q in Section 5, where we confirm that Sullivan's commutative cochain\nalgebra APL (c(K)) is formal in the commutative sense. We deduce that Q[K]\ndetermines the rationalisation c(K)0 whenever it is a complete intersection,\nand discuss the corresponding automorphism group Autho (c(K)0 ).\nThe authors are especially grateful to the organisers of the International Conference on Algebraic Topology, which was held on the Island of Skye in June\n2001. The Conference provided the opportunity for valuable discussion with\nseveral colleagues, amongst whom Octavian Cornea, Kathryn Hess, and Taras\nPanov deserve special mention. Without that remarkable and stimulating environment, our work would not have begun. We are more recently indebted\nto John Greenlees, who brought to our attention a fundamental misconception\nin a previous version of this article, and to the referee, for further improvements. We also thank the London Mathematical Society, whose support of the\nTranspennine Topology Triangle has enabled our collaboration to continue and\ndevelop.\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 5 (2005)\n\n\fDietrich Notbohm and Nigel Ray\n\n34\n\n2\n\nBackground\n\nWe begin by establishing our notation and prerequisites, recalling various aspects of Davis-Januszkiewicz spaces. We refine results of [21] in the context of\nmodel category theory, referring readers to [9] and [15] for background details.\nFollowing [25], we adopt the model category top of k -spaces and continuous\nfunctions as our topological workplace. Weak equivalences induce isomorphisms\nin homotopy, fibrations are Serre fibrations, and cofibrations have the left lifting property with respect to acyclic fibrations. Every function space Y X is\nendowed with the corresponding k -topology. Many of the spaces we consider\nhave a distinguished basepoint \u2217, and we write top+ for the model category of\npairs (X, \u2217) and basepoint preserving maps. We usually insist that the inclusion \u2217 \u2192 X be a cofibration, in which case X is well-pointed; this is automatic\nwhen X is a CW-complex and \u2217 its 0\u2013skeleton.\nGiven a small category a, we refer to a covariant functor D : a \u2192 r as an\na-diagram in r. Such diagrams are themselves the objects of a category [a,r] ,\nwhose morphisms are natural transformations of functors. We may interpret\nany object X of r as a constant diagram, which maps every object of a to X\nand every morphism to the identity.\nExample 2.1 (1) For each integer n \u2265 0, the category ord(n) has objects\n0, 1, . . . , n, equipped with a single morphism k \u2192 m when k \u2264 m. An\nord(n)-diagram\nf1\n\nf2\n\nfn\n\nX0 \u2212\u2192 X1 \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192 Xn\n\n(2.2)\n\nconsists of n composable morphisms in r.\n(2) The category \u2206 has objects (n) : = {0, 1, . . . , n} for n \u2265 0, and morphisms the nondecreasing functions; then \u2206 op - and \u2206 -diagrams are simplicial\nand cosimplicial objects of r respectively. In particular, \u2206 : \u2206 \u2192 top is the\ncosimplicial space which assigns the standard n-simplex \u2206(n) to each object\n(n).\nGiven objects X0 and X1 of r, we write the set of morphisms X0 \u2192 X1 as\nr(X0 , X1 ); when r is small, the diagrams (2.2) also form a set for every n > 1.\nFor any r it is often convenient to abbreviate [ \u2206 op ,r] to sr, and write a generic\nsimplicial object as D\u2022 . In particular, sset denotes the category of simplicial\nsets Y\u2022 .\nFrom this point on we work with an abstract simplicial complex K , whose faces\n\u03c3 are subsets of the vertices V . We assume that the empty face belongs to K ,\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 5 (2005)\n\n\fHomotopy types, formality and rationalisation\n\n35\n\nand write K \u00d7 when it is expressly omitted. The integer |\u03c3| \u2212 1 is known as the\ndimension of \u03c3 , and written dim \u03c3 ; its maximum value dim K is the dimension\nof K . When K contains every subset of V , we may call it the simplex \u2206(V ) on\nV . Each face of K therefore determines a subsimplex \u2206(\u03c3), whose boundary\n\u2202(\u03c3) is the complex obtained by deleting the subset \u03c3 . We also require the link\nlK (\u03c3), whose faces consist of those \u03c4 \\ \u03c3 for which \u03c3 \u2286 \u03c4 in K .\nDefinition 2.3 For any simplicial complex K , the small category cat(K)\nhas objects the faces of K and morphisms the inclusions i\u03c3,\u03c4 : \u03c3 \u2286 \u03c4 . The\nempty face \u2205 is an initial object, and the maximal faces \u03bc admit only identity\nmorphisms. The opposite category catop (K) has morphisms p\u03c4,\u03c3 : =iop\n\u03c3,\u03c4 : \u03c4 \u2287 \u03c3 ,\nand \u2205 is final.\nThe nondegerate simplices of the nerve N\u2022 cat(K) form the cone on the barycentric subdivision K \u2032 , and those of N\u2022 cat(K \u00d7 ) correspond to the subcomplex\nK \u2032 . So the classifying space Bcat(K), formed by realising the nerve, is a\ncontractible CW-complex, and Bcat(K \u00d7 ) is a subcomplex homeomorphic to\nK . We shall study cat(K)- and catop (K)-diagrams D in various algebraic\nand topological categories r. Usually, r is pointed by an object \u2217, which is\nboth initial and final; unless stated otherwise, we then assume that D(\u2205) = \u2217.\nFor each face \u03c3 , the overcategories cat(K) \u2193 \u03c3 and cat(K) \u21d3 \u03c3 are given by\nrestricting attention to those objects \u03c1 for which \u03c1 \u2286 \u03c3 and \u03c1 \u2282 \u03c3 respectively.\nThe undercategories \u03c3 \u2193 cat(K) and \u03c3 \u21d3 cat(K) are defined by the objects\n\u03c3 \u2286 \u03c4 and \u03c3 \u2282 \u03c4 . It follows from the definitions that\ncat(K) \u2193 \u03c3 = cat(\u2206(\u03c3)),\n\ncat(K) \u21d3 \u03c3 = cat(\u2202(\u03c3)),\n\n\u03c3 \u2193 cat(K) = cat(lK (\u03c3))\n\nand \u03c3 \u21d3 cat(K) = cat(lK (\u03c3)\u00d7 ).\n\nDimension may be interpreted as a functor dim : cat(K) \u2192 ord(m \u2212 1), which\nis a linear extension in the sense of [15]; thus cat(K) is direct and catop (K)\nis inverse.\nFor any model category r, we may therefore follow Hovey and impose an associated model structure on the category of diagrams [cat(K),r] . Weak equivalences e : C \u2192 D are given objectwise, in the sense that e(\u03c3) : C(\u03c3) \u2192 D(\u03c3)\nis a weak equivalence in r for every face \u03c3 of K . Fibrations are also given objectwise. To describe the cofibrations, we consider the restrictions of C and D\nto the overcategories cat(\u2202(\u03c3)), and write L\u03c3 C and L\u03c3 D for their respective\ncolimits; L\u03c3 is the latching functor of [15]. Then g : C \u2192 D is a cofibration\nwhenever the induced maps\nC(\u03c3) \u2210L\u03c3 C L\u03c3 D \u2212\u2192 D(\u03c3)\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 5 (2005)\n\n(2.4)\n\n\fDietrich Notbohm and Nigel Ray\n\n36\n\nare cofibrations in r for every face \u03c3 . Alternatively, the methods of Chacholski\nand Scherer [6] lead to the same model structure on [cat(K),r] .\nThere is a dual model category structure on [cat op (K),r] , where weak equivalences and cofibrations are given objectwise. To describe fibrations f : C \u2192 D,\nwe consider the restrictions of C and D to the undercategories catop (\u2202(\u03c3)),\nand write M\u03c3 C and M\u03c3 D for their respective limits; M\u03c3 is the matching functor of [15]. Then f is a fibration whenever the induced maps\nC(\u03c3) \u2212\u2192 D(\u03c3) \u00d7M\u03c3 D M\u03c3 C\n\n(2.5)\n\nare fibrations in r for every face \u03c3 .\nDefinition 2.6 For any CW-pair (X, \u2217), the exponential pair of diagrams\n(X K , XK ) consists of functors\nX K : cat(K) \u2212\u2192 top+\n\nXK : catop (K) \u2212\u2192 top+ ,\n\nand\n\nwhich assign the cartesian product X \u03c3 to each face \u03c3 of K . The value of X K\non i\u03c3,\u03c4 is the cofibration X \u03c3 \u2192 X \u03c4 , where the superfluous coordinates are set to\n\u2217, and the value of XK on p\u03c4,\u03c3 is the fibration X \u03c4 \u2192 X \u03c3 , defined by projection.\nThe pair are twins, in the sense that XK (p\u2032 ) * X K (i) = X K (j \u2032 ) * XK (q) for every\npullback square\nj\u2032\n\n\u03c3 \u2229 \u03c3 \u2032 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\uf8e6\nj\uf8e6\ny\n\u03c3\n\nin cat(K), where\n\np\u2032\n\n=\n\n(i\u2032 )op\n\nand q =\n\n\u03c3\u2032\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6 i\u2032\ny\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03c4\ni\nop\nj .\n\nThe properties of twin diagrams are analogous to those of a Mackey functor [13].\nThey include, for example, the fact that each X K (i) has left inverse XK (p),\nwhere p = iop . Our applications in Theorem 3.10 are reminiscent of [16], where\nthe acyclicity of certain Mackey functors is established.\nThe colimit colim X K is a subcomplex of X V , whose inclusion r is induced\nby interpreting the elements \u03c3 of K as faces of the (m \u2212 1)-simplex \u2206(V ).\nComposing r with any of the natural maps X \u03c3 \u2192 colim X K yields the standard inclusion X \u03c3 \u2192 X V . We note that colim X K is pointed by X \u2205 , otherwise known as the basepoint \u2217, and is homeomorphic to the pointed colimit\ncolim+ X K of [21].\nWe wish to study homotopy theoretic properties of colim X K in favourable\ncases. Yet the colimit functor behaves particularly poorly in this context, because objectwise equivalent diagrams may well have homotopy inequivalent\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 5 (2005)\n\n\fHomotopy types, formality and rationalisation\n\n37\n\ncolimits. The standard procedure for dealing with this situation is to introduce the left derived functor, known as the homotopy colimit. Following [14],\nfor example, hocolim X K may be described by the two-sided bar construction\nB(\u2217, cat(K), X K ) in top. We note that hocolim X K is also pointed, and is\nrelated to the pointed homotopy colimit hocolim+ X K of [21] by the cofibre\nsequence\nf\n\nBcat(K) \u2212\u2192 hocolim X K \u2212\u2192 hocolim+ X K\nof [2]. Since Bcat(K) is contractible, f is a weak equivalence. We may\ntherefore concentrate on hocolim X K , and so avoid basepoint complications\nwhen working with function spaces in [19].\nLemma 2.7 Every exponential diagram X K is cofibrant in [cat(K),top] .\nProof The initial cat(K)-diagram in top is the constant diagram \u2217, so X K\nis cofibrant whenever the inclusion \u2217 \u2192 X K is a cofibration. By (2.4), it\nsuffices to show that the map X \u2202(\u03c3) \u2192 X \u03c3 is a cofibration for every face \u03c3\nof K . But this map includes the fat wedge in the cartesian product, and the\nresult follows.\nAn immediate consequence of Lemma 2.7 is that the natural projection\nhocolim X K \u2212\u2192 colim X K\n\n(2.8)\n\nis a homotopy equivalence. This exemplifies one of the fundamental properties\nof the homotopy colimit functor, and is sometimes called the Projection Lemma\n[26].\n\n3\n\nIntegral cohomology and limits\n\nIn this section we work in the category modR of R-modules, and study the\ncohomology of limits of exponential diagrams B K , where B is the classifying\nspace of the circle. For this case only, we abbreviate (2.8) to hc(K) \u2192 c(K).\nWe focus on the relationship between the Stanley-Reisner algebra R[K] and\nthe Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence for H \u2217 (hc(K); R).\nWe begin by investigating the cohomology of c(K). To simplify applications in\nlater sections, we consider an arbitrary pair of twin diagrams (DK , D K ),\nDK : cat(K) \u2212\u2192 modR\n\nand\n\nD K : catop (K) \u2212\u2192 modR .\n\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 5 (2005)\n\n(3.1)\n\n\fDietrich Notbohm and Nigel Ray\n\n38\n\nThus D K (p\u2032 ) * DK (i) = DK (j) * D K (q \u2032 ) for every pullback square i * j = i\u2032 * j \u2032\nin cat(K). In particular, D K (p) has right inverse DK (i) for every morphism p = iop . Such pairs arise, for example, from any contravariant functor\nD : top \u2192 modR , by composing with the exponential twins of Definition 2.6.\nSo (DK , D K ) = (D * BK , D * B K ), and functoriality ensures the diagrams are\nr\ntwins. In this case we may apply D to the natural maps B \u03c3 \u2192 c(K) \u2212\u2192 B V ,\nand obtain homomorphisms\nD(r)\n\nh\n\nD(B V ) \u2212\u2212\u2192 D(c(K)) \u2212\u2192 lim D K\n\n(3.2)\n\nin modR .\nBy way of example, we consider the case D = H 2j (\u2212, R), for any j \u2265 0. For\nevery face \u03c3 of K , the space B \u03c3 is an Eilenberg-Mac Lane space H(Z\u03c3 , 2),\nand may be expressed as the realisation of a simplicial abelian group H\u2022 (Z\u03c3 , 2)\nwhenever convenient [18]. As a CW-complex, the cells of B \u03c3 are concentrated\nin even dimensions, and correspond to the simplices vM of \u2206(\u03c3)\u2022 . The cellular\ncohomology group H 2j (B \u03c3 ; R) is therefore isomorphic to the free R-module\ngenerated by those vM for which |M | = j and the support of M is a subset of\n\u03c3 . The diagram D K of (3.1) becomes\nH 2j (B K ; R) : catop (K) \u2212\u2192 modR ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhose value on p\u03c4,\u03c3 is the homomorphism which fixes vM whenever the support\nof M lies in \u03c3 , and annihilates it otherwise; the right inverse is the inclusion\ninduced by DK . When D = H 2j+1 (\u2212, R), the diagram is zero.\nIn the case of cohomology, we may combine the diagrams (3.3) into a graded\nversion\nH \u2217 (B K ; R) : catop (K) \u2212\u2192 gmodR ,\n(3.4)\ntaking values in the category of graded R-modules. The cup product on each\nof the constituent submodules H \u2217 (B \u03c3 ; R) is given by the product of monomials\nxL xM = xL+M , as follows from the case of a single vertex. In other words, the\ncohomology ring H \u2217 (B \u03c3 ; R) is isomorphic to the polynomial algebra SR (\u03c3). So\nH \u2217 (B K ; R) actually takes values in the category gcaR of graded commutative\nR-algebras, and maps the morphism p\u03c4,\u03c3 to the projection SR (\u03c4 ) \u2192 SR (\u03c3);\nthe right inverse is again inclusion.\nThe homomorphisms (3.2) may similarly be combined as\nr\u2217\n\nh\n\nSR (V ) \u2212\u2212\u2192 H \u2217 (c(K); R) \u2212\u2212\u2192 lim H \u2217 (B K ; R),\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere the limit is taken in gmodR . Since (3.4) is a diagram of algebras, the limit\ninherits a multiplicative structure, and it is equally appropriate to interpret\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 5 (2005)\n\n\fHomotopy types, formality and rationalisation\n\n39\n\n(3.5) in gcaR . The composition h * r \u2217 is induced by the projections SR (V ) \u2192\nSR (\u03c3). In this case, we make one further observation.\nProposition 3.6 The homomorphism r \u2217 is epic, and its kernel is the ideal\n(vU : U \u2208\n/ K).\nProof In each dimension 2j , the cells vM of B V correspond to the multisets\non V with |M | = j . The cells of c(K) form a subset, given by those M whose\nsupport is a face of K . Hence r \u2217 is epic, and its kernel is generated by the\nremaining cells. These coincide with the 2j \u2013dimensional additive generators of\nthe ideal (vU : U \u2208\n/ K).\nSo there is an isomorphism R[K] \u223c\n= H \u2217 (c(K); R) of the Stanley-Reisner algebra\n(1.1), which plays a central r\u00f4le in [4].\nReturning to our study of the twins (DK , D K ), the following definition identifies\na further important property.\nDefinition 3.7 A diagram F K : catop (K) \u2192 modR of R-modules (graded or\notherwise) is fat if the natural map F K (\u03c3) \u2192 lim F \u2202(\u03c3) is an epimorphism for\nevery face \u03c3 of K .\nThe terminology acknowledges the relationship between \u2202(\u03c3) and the fat wedge\ndescribed in Lemma 2.7.\nLemma 3.8 The twin D K is fat.\nProof We consider an arbitrary face \u03c1 of K , whose vertices we label wk for\n0 \u2264 k \u2264 d; thus d = dim \u03c1. We write \u03bck : = \u03c1 \\ wk for the maximal faces of\n\u2202(\u03c1), and abbreviate the morphism p\u03c1,\u03bck to pk for 0 \u2264 k \u2264 d.\nThe definition of lim ensures that L : = lim D \u2202(\u03c1) appears in an exact sequence\nY\nY\n\u03b4\n0 \u2212\u2192 L \u2212\u2192\nD K (\u03c3) \u2212\u2192\nD K (\u03c3),\n\u03c1\u2283\u03c3\n\n\u03c1\u2283\u03c4 \u2283\u03c3\n\nQ\nwhere \u03b4(u)(\u03c4 \u2283 \u03c3) = u(\u03c3) \u2212 D K (p\u03c4,\u03c3 )u(\u03c4 ) for any u \u2208 \u03c1\u2283\u03c3 D K (\u03c3). Hence\nu \u2208 L is determined by the values u(\u03bck ). The natural projection D K (\u03c1) \u2192\nQ\nK\n\u03c1\u2283\u03c3 D (\u03c3) therefore factors through L, and it remains for us to find u(\u03c1) \u2208\nK\nD (\u03c1) such that D K (pk )(u(\u03c1)) = u(\u03bck ) for every 0 \u2264 k \u2264 d.\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 5 (2005)\n\n\fDietrich Notbohm and Nigel Ray\n\n40\n\nP\nWe define u(\u03c1) : = \u03c1\u2283\u03c3 (\u22121)|\u03c1\\\u03c3|+1 DK (i\u03c3,\u03c1 )u(\u03c3). The fact that DK and D K\nare twins implies that\n(\n\u0001\nif wk \u2208 \u03c3\nDK (i\u03c3\\wk ,\u03bck )u \u03c3\\wk\nK\nD (pk )DK (i\u03c3,\u03c1 )u(\u03c3) =\nDK (i\u03c3,\u03bck )u(\u03c3)\notherwise,\nfor every 0 \u2264 k \u2264 d; thus D K (pk )u(\u03c1) is given by\nX\nX\n(\u22121)|\u03c1\\\u03c3|+1 DK (i\u03c3,\u03bck )u(\u03c3) +\n(\u22121)|\u03c1\\\u03c4 |+1 DK (i\u03c4 \\wk ,\u03bck )u(\u03c1\\wk ).\n\u03c4 \u220bwk\n\n\u03c36\u220bwk\n\n\u0001\nBut we may write u(\u03c3) as u (\u03c3 \u222a wk )\\wk for any \u03c3 6\u220b wk other than \u03bck . So\nthe summands cancel in pairs, leaving u(\u03bck ) as required.\nFor cohomology, Lemma 3.8 contributes to our analysis of c(K). The homotopy\nequivalence (2.8) provides a cohomology decomposition [8], in the sense that\nthe cohomology algebra H \u2217 (c(K); R) may be computed by the Bousfield-Kan\nspectral sequence [2]\nE2i,j =\u21d2 H i+j (hc(K); R),\nwhere E2i,j is isomorphic to the ith derived functor limi H j (B K ; R) for every\ni, j \u2265 0. The vertical edge homomorphism coincides with the map h of (3.5).\nLemma 3.8 is required for our computation of these limits, and Corollary 3.12\nwill confirm that the cohomology decomposition is sharp in Dwyer's language.\nOur proof uses the calculus of functors and their limits; the appropriate prerequisites may be deduced from Gabriel and Zisman [12, Appendix II \u00a73], by\ndualising their results for colimits.\nIn particular, we follow [12] (as expounded in [20], for example) by calculating\u0001\nlimi D K as the i th cohomology group of a certain cochain complex C \u2217 (D K ), \u03b4\nof R-modules. The groups are defined by\nY\nC n (D K ) : =\nD K (\u03c3n ) for n \u2265 0 ,\n\u03c30 \u2287 ... \u2287 \u03c3n\n\nand the differential \u03b4 : =\n\nPn\n\nk k\nk=0 (\u22121) \u03b4\n\nis defined on u \u2208 C n (D K ) by\n\n(\nu(\u03c30 \u2287 * * * \u2287 \u03c3\nbk \u2287 * * * \u2287 \u03c3n+1 )\n\u03b4k (u)(\u03c30 \u2287 * * * \u2287 \u03c3n+1 ) : =\nK\nD (p\u03c3n ,\u03c3n+1 )u(\u03c30 \u2287 * * * \u2287 \u03c3n )\n\nfor k 6= n + 1\nfor k = n + 1.\n\nWe may replace C \u2217 (D K ) by its quotient N \u2217 (D K ) of normalised cochains, for\nwhich the faces \u03c30 \u2283 * * * \u2283 \u03c3n are required to be distinct.\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 5 (2005)\n\n\fHomotopy types, formality and rationalisation\n\n41\n\nLemma 3.9 Given a maximal face \u03bc of K , and a diagram D : catop (K) \u2192\nmodR such that D(\u03c3) = 0 for all \u03c3 6= \u03bc, then\n(\nD(\u03bc) for i = 0\ni\nlim D =\n0\nfor i > 0.\nProof Since \u03bc is maximal, the only morphism \u03c3 \u2287 \u03bc is the identity. So the\nnormalised chain complex N \u2217 (D) is D(\u03bc) in dimension 0, and 0 in higher\ndimensions, as required.\nTheorem 3.10 For any fat diagram F K : catop (K) \u2192 modR , we have that\nlimi F K = 0 for all i > 0; in particular, limi D K = 0 for every twin D K .\nProof We proceed by induction on the total number of faces f (K); the result\nobviously holds for the initial example K = \u2205, where f (K) = 0. Our inductive\nhypothesis is that limi F K vanishes whenever K satisfies f (K) \u2264 f .\nWe therefore consider an arbitrary complex K with f (K) = f + 1, and write\nJ \u2282 K for the subcomplex obtained by deleting a single maximal face \u03bc.\nThe inclusion of J defines a functor G : catop (J) \u2192 catop (K), whose induced\nfunctor G\u2217 : [cat op(K),mod R ] \u2192 [cat op (J),mod R ] acts by restriction, and\nadmits a right adjoint G\u2217 , known as the right Kan extension [17]. In particular,\nG\u2217 F J is given on \u03c3 \u2208 K by lim F \u2202(\u03bc) when \u03c3 = \u03bc, and F \u03c3 otherwise.\nBut F \u03bc \u2192 lim F \u2202(\u03bc) is an epimorphism, by Lemma 3.8, so the natural transformation F K \u2192 G\u2217 F J is epic on every face of K , and its kernel H is zero on\nevery face except \u03bc. We acquire a short exact sequence of functors\n0 \u2212\u2192 H \u2212\u2192 F K \u2212\u2192 G\u2217 F J \u2212\u2192 0,\nwhich induces a long exact sequence of higher limits. By Lemma 3.9, this\ncollapses to a sequence of isomorphisms\nlimi F K \u223c\n(3.11)\n= limi G\u2217 F J ,\nfor i \u2265 1. We now apply the composition of functors spectral sequence [5], [12]\nlimn Gi\u2217 F J =\u21d2 limn+i F J .\nHere Gi\u2217 denotes the ith derived functor of G\u2217 ; it may be evaluated on any face\n\u03c3 of K as limi F \u2202(\u03c3) , and therefore vanishes for i > 0, by inductive hypothesis.\nSo the spectral sequence collapses onto the first row of the E 2 page, from\nwhich we obtain isomorphisms limn G\u2217 F J \u223c\n= limn F J for all n \u2265 0. Since the\ninductive hypothesis applies to J , we deduce that limn G\u2217 F J = 0 for every\nn > 0. Combining this with (3.11) concludes the proof.\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 5 (2005)\n\n\fDietrich Notbohm and Nigel Ray\n\n42\n\nCorollary 3.12 The Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence for B K collapses at the\nE2 page; it is concentrated along the vertical axis, and given by\n(\nlim H j (B K ; R) if i = 0\ni j\nK\nlim H (B ; R) =\n0\notherwise.\nProof The result follows immediately from Theorem 3.10 by letting D K be\nH j (\u2212; R) for every j \u2265 0.\nCorollary 3.12 confirms that the edge homomorphism h is an isomorphism\nin gcaR . When combined with (3.5) and Proposition 3.6 it implies that the\nnatural map\nh\nR[K] \u223c\n= H \u2217 (c(K); R) \u2212\u2192 lim H \u2217 (B K ; R),\nwhich is induced by the projections R[K] \u2192 SR (\u03c3), is also an isomorphism.\nThis may be proven directly, by refining the methods of Proposition 3.6.\n\n4\n\nIntegral formality\n\nIn this section we study the formality of c(K) over our arbitrary commutative ring R, and construct a zig-zag of weak equivalences between the singular\ncochain algebra C \u2217 (c(K); R) and its cohomology ring.\nWe work in the model category dgaR of differential graded R-algebras, whose\ndifferentials have degree +1; morphisms which induces isomorphisms in cohomology are known as quasi-isomorphisms. The model structure arises by\ninterpreting dgaR as the category of monoids in the monoidal model category\ndgmodR of unbounded cochain complexes over R. The latter is isomorphic to\nHovey's category of unbounded chain complexes [15], and the model structure\nis induced on dgaR by checking that it satisfies the monoid axiom of [22]. As\nSchwede and Shipley confirm, weak equivalences are quasi-isomorphisms and\nfibrations are epimorphisms. Cofibrations are defined by the appropriate lifting\nproperty, and are necessarily degreewise split injections. We emphasise that\nthe objects of dgaR need not be commutative.\nA differential graded R-algebra C \u2217 is formal in dgaR whenever there is a\nzig-zag of quasi-isomorphisms\n\u223c\n\n\u223c\n\nH(C \u2217 ) \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2190\u2212 C \u2217\n\n(4.1)\n\nin dgaR , where we follow the standard convention of assigning the zero differential to the cohomology algebra H(C \u2217 ). Our aim is to show that the cochain\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 5 (2005)\n\n\fHomotopy types, formality and rationalisation\n\n43\n\nalgebra C \u2217 (c(K); R) is always formal in dgaR . This extends Franz's result\n[11], which only applies to complexes arising from smooth fans.\nWe begin by choosing D to be the j -dimensional cochain \u0001functor C j (\u2212; R) in\n(3.1), thus creating twin diagrams C j (BK ; R), C j (B K ; R) for each j \u2265 0. As\nin (3.4), we may consider the graded version C \u2217 (\u2212; R) in dgmodR . In fact\nits values are always R-algebras, with respect to the cup product of cochains.\nThe product is not commutative, but the procedure for forming the limit of\na dgaR -diagram remains the same; work in dgmodR , and superimpose the\ninduced multiplicative structure.\nFor the Eilenberg-Mac Lane space B , we let v denote a generator of H 2 (B; R),\nwhich is isomorphic to R. We choose a cocycle \u03c8v representing v in C 2 (B; R),\nand define a homomorphism \u03c8 : H \u2217 (B; R) \u2192 C \u2217 (B; R) by \u03c8(v k ) = (\u03c8v )k , for\nall k \u2265 0. By construction, \u03c8 is multiplicative, and is a quasi-isomorphism in\ndgaR . In order to extend this procedure we introduce a quasi-isomorphism \u03ba,\ndefined by composition with the K\u00fcnneth isomorphism as\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u03c8\u2297\n\nH \u2217 (B V ; R) \u2212\u2212\u2192 H \u2217 (B; R)\u2297V \u2212\u2212\u2192 C \u2217 (B; R)\u2297V ;\n\n(4.2)\n\n\u03ba is also multiplicative.

By (2.5) this occurs precisely when\nD K is fat, and therefore holds for H \u2217 (B K ; R) and C \u2217 (B K ; R) by Lemma 3.8;\nit follows for H \u2217 (B; R)\u2297K by the K\u00fcnneth isomorphism. So far as C \u2217 (B; R)\u2297K\nis concerned, we note that singular cochains determine a pair of twin diagrams\n(C\u2297K , C \u2297K ) in dgaR . Both functors assign C \u2217 (B; R)\u2297\u03c3 to the face \u03c3 . The\nvalue of C\u2297K on i\u03c3,\u03c4 is the inclusion C \u2217 (B; R)\u2297\u03c3 \u2192 C \u2217 (B; R)\u2297\u03c4 , and the value\nof C \u2297K on p\u03c4,\u03c3 is the projection C \u2217 (B; R)\u2297\u03c4 \u2192 C \u2217 (B; R)\u2297\u03c3 ; the latter requires\nthe augmentation induced by the base point of B . Hence C \u2297K is also fat, and\nC \u2217 (B; R)\u2297K is fibrant. Similar remarks apply to Hom(C\u2217 (B)\u2297K ; R).\nThe homomorphisms in question are therefore objectwise equivalences of fibrant\ndiagrams, and induces weak equivalences of limits by [15].\nLemma 4.7 The natural homomorphism g : C \u2217 (c(K); R) \u2192 lim C \u2217 (B K ; R) is\na quasi-isomorphism in dgaR .\nProof The edge isomorphism h of (3.5) and Corollary 3.12 factorises as\nH(g)\n\nl\n\nH(C \u2217 (c(K); R)) \u2212\u2212\u2192 H(lim C \u2217 (B K ; R)) \u2212\u2192 lim H \u2217 (B K ; R)\nin dgaR , where l is induced by the collection of compatible homomorphisms\nH(lim C \u2217 (B K ; R)) \u2212\u2192 H \u2217 (B \u03c3 ; R).\nNow let d be the differential on C j (\u2212; R) for every j \u2265 0, and define the\ncycle and boundary functors Z j , I j : top \u2192 modR as the kernel and image\nof d respectively. They determine twin diagrams, and therefore fat functors\nZ K , I K : catop (K) \u2192 modR . Theorem 3.10 confirms that limi Z j (B K ; R) =\nlimi I j (B K ; R) = 0 for all i > 0 and j \u2265 0. It follows immediately that l is an\nisomorphism, and therefore that H(g) is an isomorphism, as sought.\nWe may now complete our analysis of C \u2217 (c(K); R).\nTheorem 4.8 The differential graded R-algebra C \u2217 (c(K); R) is formal in\ndgaR .\nProof Combining Corollary 3.12 with Lemmas 4.6 and 4.7 yields a zig-zag\nh\n\ng\n\nH \u2217 (c(K); R) \u2212\u2192 lim H \u2217 (B K ; R) \u2212\u2192 . . . \u2190\u2212 lim C \u2217 (B K ; R) \u2190\u2212 C \u2217 (c(K); R)\nof quasi-isomorphisms, as required by (4.1).\n\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 5 (2005)\n\n\fHomotopy types, formality and rationalisation\n\n45\n\nRemark 4.9 The proof of Theorem 4.8 extends to exponential diagrams\nX K for which C \u2217 (X; R) is formal in dgaR and the K\u00fcnneth isomorphism\nH \u2217 (X V ; R) \u223c\n= H \u2217 (X; R)\u2297V holds. We replace \u03c8 in (4.4) by the corresponding\n\u223c\n\u223c\n\u2217\nzig-zag H (X; R) \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2190\u2212 C \u2217 (X; R) of quasi-isomorphisms, and repeat the\nremainder of the argument above.\n\n5\n\nRational formality\n\nIn our final section we turn to the rational case R = Q, and confirm the formality of Sullivan's algebra of rational cochains on c(K) in the commutative\nsetting. This involves stricter conditions than those for general R, and has\ndeeper topological consequences. In particular, it leads us to a minimal model\nwhenever Q[K] is a complete intersection ring, and thence to rational uniqueness. We refer readers to Bousfield and Gugenheim [1] for details of the model\ncategory of differential graded commutative Q-algebras, and to F\u00e9lix, Halperin\nand Thomas [10] for background information on rational homotopy theory.\nWe begin by replacing C \u2217 (X; R) with Sullivan's rational algebra APL (X) of\npolynomial forms[10]. The commutativity of the latter is crucial, and suggests\nwe work in the category dgcaQ of differential graded commutative Q-algebras\n[1]. The existence of a model structure is assured by working over a field; as\nbefore, weak equivalences are quasi-isomorphisms, fibrations are epimorphisms,\nand cofibrations are defined by the appropriate lifting properties.\nFor each s \u2265 0, we write the differential algebra of rational polynomial forms\non the standard s-simplex as \u2207s (\u2217). It is an object of dgcaQ . For each t \u2265 0,\nthe forms of dimension t define a simplicial vector space \u2207\u2022 (t) over Q, and\n\u2207\u2022 (\u2217) becomes a simplicial object in dgcaQ . So\nA\u2217 (Y\u2022 ) : = sset(Y\u2022 , \u2207\u2022 (\u2217))\nis also an object of dgcaQ , which is weakly equivalent to the normalised cochain\ncomplex N \u2217 (Y\u2022 ; Q). Then APL (X) is defined as A\u2217 (S\u2022 X), where S\u2022 denotes\nthe total singular complex functor top \u2192 sset. The PL de Rham Theorem\n[1] asserts that the cohomology algebra H(APL (X)) is naturally isomorphic to\nH \u2217 (X; Q). As usual, we invest cohomology algebras with the zero differential.\nA differential graded commutative Q-algebras A\u2217 is formal in dgcaQ whenever\nthere is a zig-zag of quasi-isomorphisms\n\u223c\n\n\u223c\n\nH(A\u2217 ) \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2190\u2212 A\u2217\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 5 (2005)\n\n(5.1)\n\n\fDietrich Notbohm and Nigel Ray\n\n46\n\nin dgcaQ . A topological space X is rationally formal whenever APL (X) satisfies (5.1).\nFor any such X , a minimal Sullivan model may be constructed directly from\nthe algebra H \u2217 (X; Q). Our remaining goal is therefore to show that c(K) is\nrationally formal, and to consider the implications for the uniqueness of spaces\nX realising Q[K]. The proof parallels that for general R, but the need to\nrespect commutativity forces several changes of detail.\nWe choose D to be APL in (3.1), creating twin diagrams (APL (BK ), APL (B K ))\nin dgcaQ . As before, we form limits by working in dgmodQ , and superimposing the induced multiplicative structure. Applying cohomology yields the twins\n(H \u2217 (BK ; Q), H \u2217 (B K ; Q)), whose value on each face \u03c3 is SQ (\u03c3) in dgmodQ .\nBoth APL (B K ) and H \u2217 (B K ; Q) are fat, by Lemma 3.8.\nUsing the fact that H(APL (B V )) is isomorphic to SQ (V ), we choose cocycles\n\u03c6j in APL (B V ) representing vj for every 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m. We may then define a\nhomomorphism\n\u03c6 : H \u2217 (B V ; Q) \u2212\u2192 APL (B V )\n(5.2)\nby \u03c6(vj ) = \u03c6j , because APL (B V ) is commutative. Moreover, \u03c6 is a quasiisomorphism, reflecting the rational formality of the Eilenberg-Mac Lane space\nH(ZV ; 2). By restriction, we interpret the \u03c6j as cocycles in APL (B \u03c3 ) for every\nface \u03c3 . They then represent vj in SQ (\u03c3) when \u03c3 contains vj , and 0 otherwise.\nWe obtain compatible quasi-isomorphisms on each B \u03c3 , which combine to create\na map\n\u03c6 : H \u2217 (B K ; Q) \u2212\u2192 APL (B K )\nof catop (K)-diagrams in dgcaQ . It is an objectwise weak equivalence. Taking\nlimits yields a homomorphism\nl(\u03c6) : lim H \u2217 (B K ; Q) \u2212\u2192 lim APL (B K )\nof differential graded commutative algebras over Q.\nLemma 5.3 The homomorphism l(\u03c6) is a quasi-isomorphism in dgcaQ .\nProof Both diagrams are fat, and therefore fibrant by (2.5). So \u03c6 induces a\nweak equivalence of limits.\nBecause the B \u03c3 are Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces, it is convenient to complete our\nproof of Theorem 5.5 in terms of simplicial sets. We may then take advantage\nof the fact that A\u2217 converts colimits in sset to limits in dgcaQ , for reasons\nwhich are purely set-theoretic.\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 5 (2005)\n\n\fHomotopy types, formality and rationalisation\n\n47\n\nWe denote the realisation functor sset \u2192 top by | \u2212 |. Given an arbitrary\nsimplicial set Y\u2022 , there is a quasi-isomorphism\n\u223c\n\nAPL (|Y\u2022 |) = A\u2217 (S\u2022 |Y\u2022 |) \u2212\u2192 A\u2217 (Y\u2022 ),\n\n(5.4)\n\ninduced by the natural equivalence Y\u2022 \u2192 S\u2022 |Y\u2022 |. For each face \u03c3 of K , we\nchoose |H\u2022 (Z\u03c3 ; 2)| as our model for B \u03c3 ; it is well-pointed, by the cofibration\ninduced by the inclusion of the trivial subgroup {0} \u2192 Z\u03c3 . We write H\u2022K for\nthe corresponding diagram of simplicial sets, which takes the value H\u2022 (Z\u03c3 ; 2)\non \u03c3 .\nTheorem 5.5 The space c(K) is rationally formal.\nProof Since realisation is left adjoint to S\u2022 , it commutes with colimits. So we\nmay write\nc(K) = colim |H\u2022K | \u223c\n= | colim H\u2022K |,\nwhere the second colimit is taken in sset. Applying (5.4) gives a zig-zag\n\u223c\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u223c\n\nlim APL (B K ) \u2212\u2192 lim A\u2217 (H\u2022K ) \u2212\u2192 A\u2217 (colim H\u2022K ) \u2190\u2212 APL (c(K)),\n\n(5.6)\n\nwhere the central isomorphism follows from the property of A\u2217 described above.\nCombining (5.6) with Corollary 3.12 and Lemma 5.3 yields a zig-zag\nl(\u03c6)\n\nh\n\n\u223c\n\n\u223c\n\nH \u2217 (c(K); Q) \u2212\u2192 lim H \u2217 (B K ; Q) \u2212\u2212\u2192 lim APL (B K ) \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2190\u2212 APL (c(K))\nof quasi-isomorphisms in dgcaQ . The result follows from (5.1).\nRemark 5.7 By analogy with Remark 4.9, the proof of Theorem 5.5 extends\nto exponential diagrams X K for which X is rationally formal; the K\u00fcnneth\nisomorphism holds automatically, because we are working over Q. The product APL (X)\u2297V \u2192 APL (X V ) of the maps induced by projection is a quasiisomorphism, and is natural with respect to projection and inclusion of coordinates. So we may replace \u03c6 in (5.2) by the corresponding zig-zag of quasiisomorphisms\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u223c\n\n\u223c\n\n\u223c\n\nH \u2217 (X V ; Q) \u2212\u2192 H \u2217 (X; Q)\u2297V \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2190\u2212 APL (X)\u2297V \u2212\u2192 APL (X V ),\nand proceed with the remainder of the argument above.\nTheorem 5.5 confirms that a minimal Sullivan model for c(K) may be constructed directly from Q[K]. It consists of an acyclic fibration\n\u03b7 : (SQ (W (K)), d) \u2212\u2192 H \u2217 (c(K); Q),\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 5 (2005)\n\n(5.8)\n\n\fDietrich Notbohm and Nigel Ray\n\n48\n\nwhere W (K) is an appropriately graded set of generators (necessarily exterior\nin odd dimensions), and provides a cofibrant replacement for H \u2217 (c(K); Q) in\ndgcaQ . In general, W (K) is not easy to describe, although special cases such\nas Example 5.10 below are straightforward, and lead to our uniqueness result.\nThe properties of W (K) are linked to those of the loop space \u03a9c(K), whose\nstudy was begun in [21]; we expect to return to this relationship in future.\nThe principal calculational tool of rational homotopy theory is the Sullivan-de\nRham equivalence of homotopy categories, which asserts that Bousfield and\nGugenheim's adjoint pair of derived functors\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\nho ssetQ \u2212\n\u2190\u2212\n\u2212\u2212 ho dgcaQ\nrestrict to inverse equivalences between certain full subcategories [1]. These\nare given by nilpotent simplicial sets of finite type, and algebras which are\nequivalent to minimal algebras with finitely many generators in each dimension.\nIn particular, the equivalence identifies homotopy classes of maps [c(K)0 , c(L)0 ]\nwith homotopy classes of morphisms [SQ (W (L)), SQ (W (K))]. Since every object of dgcaQ is fibrant, it suffices to consider homotopy classes of the form\n[SQ (W (L)), H \u2217 (c(K); Q)]; of course SQ (W (L)) cannot be substituted similarly,\nbecause H \u2217 (c(L); Q) is not usually cofibrant. Nevertheless, the function\n[SQ (W (L)), H \u2217 (c(K); Q)] \u2212\u2192 gcaQ (H \u2217 (c(L); Q), H \u2217 (c(K); Q))\n\n(5.9)\n\ninduced by taking cohomology is always surjective, and it would be of interest\nto understand its kernel.\nExample 5.10 Let (\u03bb(k) : 1 \u2264 k \u2264 t) be a sequence of disjoint subsets of V ,\nwhere \u03bb(k) has cardinality n(k), and define L to be the subcomplex of \u2206(V )\nobtained by deleting all faces containing one or more of the \u03bb(k). We write\n\u03bb : = \u222ak \u03bb(k), and |\u03bb| = n. Over any commutative ring R, the Stanley-Reisner\nalgebra R[L] is given by quotienting out the regular sequence v\u03bb(1) , . . . v\u03bb(t)\nfrom SR (V ).\nOver Q, the generating set W (L) of (5.8) consists of V in dimension 2, and\nelements w(k) in dimension 2n(k) \u2212 1, for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 t; the differential is given\nby dvj = 0 for all j , and dw(k) = v\u03bb(k) . The fibration \u03b7 identifies the vertices\nV in dimension 2, and annihilates every w(k).\nSince the elements w(k) are odd dimensional, every dgcaQ -morphism\nSQ (W (L)) \u2192 H \u2217 (c(K); Q)\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 5 (2005)\n\n\fHomotopy types, formality and rationalisation\n\n49\n\nis determined by its effect on V , and the function (5.9) is bijective. It follows\nthat Autho (c(L)0 ) (as defined in Section 1) is isomorphic to the group of algebra\nautomorphisms Aut(Q[L]), and is therefore\na subgroup of GL(m, Q). It con\u0001\n0 , where M \u2208 GL(m \u2212 n, Q) acts on QV \\\u03bb ,\ntains all matrices of the form M\nN \u03a3\nand \u03a3 permutes the elements of \u03bb. The permutations act on the elements of\neach individual \u03bb(k), and interchange those \u03bb(k) which are of common cardinality. We conjecture that every automorphism of Q[L] may be represented by\nsuch a matrix.\nIt is convenient to refer to L as a complete intersection complex whenever Q[L]\nis a complete intersection ring. A straightforward application of [3, Theorem\n2.3.3] shows that this occurs if and only if L takes the form of Example 5.10.\nOur final result concerns uniqueness, and is a consequence of the fact that\ncomplete interseection complexes are a special case of Sullivan's examples [24,\npage 317]. Following Sullivan, it may be summarised by the statement that\nc(L) and Q[L] are intrinsically formal for any such L.\nProposition 5.11 Let X be a nilpotent CW-complex of finite type, which\nrealises a complete intersection ring Q[L]; then the rationalisations of X and\nc(L) are homotopy equivalent.\nProof We write the generators of the cohomology algebra H \u2217 (X; Q) as vj\u2032 ,\nwhere 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m, and choose representing cocycles \u03c6j in APL (X). Each\n\u2032\nmonomial vM\nis therefore represented by the corresponding product \u03c6M . It\nfollows that \u03c6\u03bb(k) is a coboundary, and there exist elements \u03b8(k) such that\nd\u03b8(k) = \u03c6\u03bb(k) in APL (X) for all 1 \u2264 k \u2264 t.\nWe define a dgcaQ -morphism \u03b7 : SQ (W (L)) \u2192 APL (X) by setting \u03b7(vj ) : = \u03c6j\nand \u03b7(w(k)) : = \u03b8(k), for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m and 1 \u2264 k \u2264 t resepectively. So \u03b7 is\na weak equivalence, and is a minimal model for X . Hence X and c(L) have\nisomorphic minimal models, and the result follows.\n\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 5 (2005)\n\n\fDietrich Notbohm and Nigel Ray\n\n50\n\nReferences\n[1] A K Bousfield, Victor K A M Gugenheim, On PL De Rham theory and\nrational homotopy type, Mem.
