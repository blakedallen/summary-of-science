These solutions, being known already for a long time [4, 5], got a new\ninsight in [6].\nThe leading order of the 1/N -expansion in the matrix size of the matrix model is described by\nthe semiclassical tau-function of the so-called universal Whitham hierarchy [7] (see the details about\none-matrix and two-matrix cases in [8] and [9]).\nOne may also consider more general solutions to matrix models, identifying them with generic\nsolutions to the loop (Schwinger\u2013Dyson, or Virasoro) equations [10], to be the Ward identities satisfied\nby matrix integrals [11].\nWe consider solutions to the loop equations admitting multi-matrix integral representations [6, 12,\n13]. These solutions are associated with families of Riemann surfaces and form a sort of a basis in the\nspace of all solutions to the loop equations [13] (like the finite-gap solutions form a similar basis in the\nspace of all solutions to an integrable hierarchy). They can be distinguished by their \"isomonodromic\"\nproperties-switching on higher matrix model couplings and 1/N -corrections does not change the\nfamily of Riemann surfaces, but just reparameterizes the moduli as functions of these couplings. On\nthe side of integrable hierarchies, these solutions must satisfy some equations of multicomponent\nhierarchies [14], not just the Toda chain hierarchy equations, which are satisfied only by a one-cut\nsolution.\nMuch progress has been made on the way to constructing explicit solutions of matrix models in\nthe large-N expansion since [15]. It was shown (primarily for the one-cut case [16]) that the variables\nconvenient for describing solutions in the genus expansion are branching points of the corresponding\na\n\nE-mail: chekhov@mi.ras.ru\nE-mail: eynard@saclay.cea.fr\n1\nWe reserve N to denote the size of matrix in matrix models.\nb\n\n1\n\n\fRiemann surface and the so-called moments of the potential. These variables, being expressed highly\nnonlinearly in times and occupation numbers, allow reducing the problem to solving some algebraic\nrelations. Using this technique, the two-matrix model was solved in the large-N limit in the onecut case [17], this technique was extended to the multicut case [9],[18] , and the subleading term of\n1/N -expansion was found in [19].\nIn [20], the consistent diagrammatic technique for finding the loop means (multiresolvents) in the\n1/N -expansion of the Hermitian one-matrix model (1MM) was proposed. The main result of the\npresent paper is the generalization of this technique to describe the free energy contributions of all\norders in 1/N for multicut solutions of the 1MM.\nIn Sec. 2, we describe the general properties of multi-cut solutions of 1MM and the solution of the\nloop equation in the large-N limit.\nIn Sec. 3, we first present necessary notions of the Riemann geometry describing the Bergmann\nbidifferentials and the loop insertion operator (which acts from the space of s-differentials to the space\nof (s + 1)-differentials) and then describe the diagrammatic technique of [20] in a more convenient\nterms than in the original presentation.\nIn Sec. 4, we introduce the operator H, which reduces the degree of forms by one and is in a\nsense inverse to the loop insertion operator. This eventually makes possible to present the genus k\ncontribution to the free energy through the action of H on the one-point resolvent (for all k except\nk = 1; for the latter case, the answer has been already obtained, see [21], [19]).\n\n2\n\nMatrix models in 1/N -expansion\n\n2.1\n\nLoop equation and resolvents\n\nLet us consider the formal integral of the 1MM [22]\nZ\n\n\u2212 tN tr V (X)\n\nDX e\n\n0\n\n= e\u2212F ,\n\n(1)\n\nN \u00d7N\n\nP\n\nwhere V (X) = n\u22651 tn X n and h\u0304 = t0 /N is a formal expansion parameter. The integration in (1) goes\nover N \u00d7 N Hermitian matrices, and for generic potentials, the integration may go over curves in the\ncomplex plane of each of N proper variables, which are eigenvalues of X. The topological expansion\nof the Feynman diagrams series is then equivalent to the expansion in even powers of h\u0304 for\nF \u2261 F(h\u0304, t0 , t1 , t2 , . . .) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\ng=0\n\nh\u03042g\u22122 Fg .\n\n(2)\n\nCustomarily, t0 = h\u0304N is the scaled number of eigenvalues. It is convenient, but not compulsory,\nto assume the potential V (p) to be a polynomial of the fixed degree m + 1.

Using Eq. (6), one can express the second term in the r.h.s. of loop equation (9) through\nW (p), and Eq. (9) becomes an equation on one-point resolvent (4).\nSubstituting genus expansion (8) in Eq.

(10), Wg (p) is expressed through only the Wgi (p) for which gi < g. This fact permits developing\nthe iterative procedure.\nThe solution W1 (p) to the loop equation in the multicut case was first found by Akemann [24].3 He\nalso managed to integrate it in order to obtain the free energy F1 in the two-cut case. The genus-one\npartition function in the generic multi-cut case was proposed in [25, 26], where it was observed that\nthe Akemann formula coincides with the correlator of twist fields (that produce cuts on the complex\nplane and give rise to the hyperelliptic Riemann surface as a cover of complex plane) computed by\nAl.Zamolodchikov [27], with some corrections due to including star operators (introduced by G.Moore\nin [28]) into consideration. In [21, 19], the genus-one correction was derived by solving the loop\nequation, which generalize the Akemann result for partition function to arbitrary number of cuts.\n2\n\nAlthough this operator contains all partial derivatives w.r.t. the variables tk 's, below we introduce additional variables\nSi and, therefore, we use the partial derivative notation here.\n3\nThe universal critical behavior of the corresponding correlation functions was discussed in [5].\n\n3\n\n\f2.2\n\nSolution in genus zero\n\nThe form of loop equation (9) is based exclusively on the reparameterization invariance of the matrix\nintegral, which retains independently on the details of eigenvalue density distribution. In the 1MM\ncase at N \u2192 \u221e, the eigenvalues fill in some segments in complex plane, dependently on the shape of\npotential V (X).

For the polynomial potential of power m + 1, the resolvent W0 (p) is a function on\ncomplex plane with m cuts, or on a hyperelliptic curve y 2 = V \u2032 (p)2 + 4Pm\u22121 (p) of genus g = m \u2212 1.\nFor generic potential V (X) with m \u2192 \u221e, this curve may have an infinite genus, but we can still\nconsider solutions with a finite, fixed number n of cuts filled by eigenvalues. For this, we separate the\nsmooth part of the curve introducing\ny(p) \u2261 M (p)\u1ef9(p),\n\nand \u1ef9 2 (p) \u2261\n\nY2n\n\n\u03b1=1\n\n(p \u2212 \u03bc\u03b1 )\n\n(19)\n\nwith all branching points \u03bc\u03b1 distinct. The variable \u1ef9 defines therefore the new, reduced Riemann\nsurface, which plays a fundamental role in our construction. In what follows, we still assume M (p) to\nbe a polynomial of degree m \u2212 n, keeping in mind that n is always finite and fixed, while m \u2265 n can\nbe chosen arbitrarily large.\n\n4\n\n\fFrom now on, we distinguish between images of the infinity at two sheets-physical and unphysical-\nof hyperelliptic Riemann surface (19) respectively denoting them \u221e+ and \u221e\u2212 . By convention, we set\n\u1ef9|p\u2192\u221e+ \u223c pn , and M (p) is then4\n1\nV \u2032 (w)\nM (p) = \u2212 res\u221e+ dw\n.\n2\n(w \u2212 p)\u1ef9(w)\n\n(20)\n\nInserting this solution in Eq.

Rewriting (16) as quadratic equation for W0 (p) we\nhad to imply that polynomial (17) depends on some unknown parameters to be fixed later. Indeed,\nthe dependence on coefficients of (17) can be retranslated into the dependence on filling fractions\nSi =\n\nI\n\nAi\n\nd\u03bb\ny(\u03bb) =\n2\u03c0i\n\nI\n\nAi\n\nd\u03bb\nM (\u03bb)\u1ef9(\u03bb),\n2\u03c0i\n\n(22)\n\nwhere Ai , i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1 is the basis of A-cycles on the hyperelliptic Riemann surface (19) (we\nmay conveniently choose them to be the first n \u2212 1 cuts). Adding the (normalized) total number of\neigenvalues\nI\nd\u03bb\n= res\u221e+ y(\u03bb)d\u03bb\n(23)\nt0 =\ny(\u03bb)\n2\u03c0i\nCD\nto the set of Si , we obtain n parameters, which exactly matches the number of coefficients of (17) in\nthe nondegenerate case where m = n. We assume the occupation number for the last, nth cut to be\nPn\u22121\nt0 \u2212 i=1\nSi \u2261 Sn . 5 If n < m, we consider variables (22) as conditions to which we add, following\n(13), the asymptotic conditions\n\u2212t0 \u03b4k,n =\n\n1\n2\n\nI\n\nCD\n\nd\u03bb \u03bbk V \u2032 (\u03bb)\n,\n2\u03c0i \u1ef9(\u03bb)\n\nk = 0, . . . , n,\n\n(24)\n\nwhich provide n + 1 equations for 2n constants \u03bc\u03b1 .\nIn the planar limit of matrix models, filling fractions (22) can be considered as independent parameters of the theory, since the jumps between different cuts are suppressed as non-perturbative\ncorrections in h\u0304. (Obviously, no parameters Si arise in the one-cut case.) In particular, this imposes\nrestrictions\n\u2202\n\u2202\nSi = 0, i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1,\nt0 = 0.\n(25)\n\u2202V (p)\n\u2202V (p)\nIn accordance with the original matrix model formulation (see e.g. [4], [24]) one must look for the\ngenuine minimum of the matrix model effective action with respect to all variables: Si together with\nthe times tj . This implies vanishing of partial derivatives of F0 with respect to Si , and one can find\n(see [4], [3], and [29]) that these derivatives are differences of chemical potential on disjoint cuts, equal\nto the integrals over dual B-cycles on (19):\n\u2202F0\n=\n\u2202Si\n\nI\n\nBi\n\ny(\u03bb)d\u03bb \u2261 \u03a0i\n\n(26)\n\nNote that the geometric definition of F0 is not modular invariant, i.e., it depends on the choice of Aand B-cycle basis on (19). Under the change of homology basis, F0 transforms in accordance with the\nduality transformations [30]. The higher-genus corrections become also scheme dependent: choosing\nSi or \u03a0i as independent variables, we obtain different expressions for the genus-one free energy.\n4\n\nBy a standard convention, res\u221e dx/x = \u22121, and the direction of the integration contour at the infinity point therefore\ncoincides with the direction of contour for integrals over CD and over the set of A-cycles, see below.\n5\nIt is sometimes convenient to consider Sn instead of t0 as a canonical variable. However, in all instants we use Sn ,\nwe specially indicate it for not confusing Sn with the \"genuine\" filling fraction variables Si , i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1.\n\n5\n\n\f3\n\nCalculating resolvents. Diagram technique\n\nIn this section, we rederive the diagrammatic technique of [20] in a more concise form of differentials\non Riemann surface (19). We choose Si to be independent variables. Our main goal is to invert loop\nequation (10) to obtain the expression for Wk (p) for any k \u2265 1.\n\n3.1\n\nBergmann bidifferential and two-point resolvent\n\nLet us consider the Bergmann kernel (canonically normalized bidifferential in Fay's terminology) which\nis the bi-differential on a Riemann surface \u03a3g that is symmetrical in its arguments P, Q \u2208 \u03a3g and has\nthe only singularity at the coinciding arguments where it has the behavior (see [31], [32])\nB(P, Q) =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n1\n+ SB (P ) + o(1) d\u03c4 (P )d\u03c4 (Q),\n2\n(\u03c4 (P ) \u2212 \u03c4 (Q))\n6\n\n(27)\n\nin some local coordinate \u03c4 (P ); SB (P ) is the Bergmann projective connection and we fix the normalization (the possibility to add symmetrical bilinear forms composed from holomorphic 1-differentials\nin variables Q and P ) claiming vanishing all the integrals over A-cycles of B(P, Q):\nI\n\nB(P, Q) = 0, for i = 1, . . . , g.\n\n(28)\n\nAi\n\nWe then have the following standard Rauch variational formulas relating B(P, Q) with other objects\non a (general, not necessarily hyperelliptic) Riemann surface:\n1\n\u2202\nB(P, Q) = B(P, [\u03bc\u03b1 ])B([\u03bc\u03b1 ], Q),\n\u2202\u03bc\u03b1\n2\nand\n\nI\n\nBi\n\nB(P, Q) = 2\u03c0idwi (P ),\n\n(29)\n\n(30)\n\nwhere \u03bc\u03b1 is any simple branching point of the complex structure, then, by definition, in the vicinity\nof \u03bc\u03b1 ,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\ndq\n+ O( q \u2212 \u03bc\u03b1 )dq ,\nB(P, Q)|Q\u2192\u03bc\u03b1 = B(P, [\u03bc\u03b1 ]) \u221a\n(31)\nq \u2212 \u03bc\u03b1\nand dwi (P ) are canonically normalized holomorphic differentials:\nI\n\nAj\n\ndwi (P ) = \u03b4ij .\n\n(32)\n\nWe also introduce the 1-form dEQ,Q0 (P ), which is the primitive of B(P, Q):\ndEQ,Q0 (P ) =\n\nZ\n\nQ\n\nB(P, \u03be),\n\ndEQ,Q0 (P )|P \u2192Q =\n\nQ0\n\nThen, obviously,\n\nI\n\nAi\n\nd\u03c4 (P )\n+ finite .\n\u03c4 (P ) \u2212 \u03c4 (Q)\n\ndEQ,Q0 (P ) = 0.\n\n(33)\n\n(34)\n\nThe form dEQ,Q0 (P ) is single-valued w.r.t.

Let us consider the Jacobian J, n\nwhich is oa\nR\ng-dimensional torus related to the curve \u03a3g . Recall that the Abel map \u03a3g 7\u2192 J : Q \u2192 ~x \u2261 QQ0 d\u03c9i ,\nwhere Q0 is a reference point, set into the correspondence to each point Q of the complex curve\nthe vector in the Jacobian, and we also introduce the theta function \u0398[\u03b1] (~x) of an odd characteristic\n[\u03b1] that becomes zero at ~x = 0. We introduce the normalizing functions (1/2-differentials) h\u03b1 (x)\ndetermined for the subset of ~x \u2208 J that are image points of Q \u2208 \u03a3g\nh2\u03b1 (~x)\n\n=\n\ng\nX\n\u2202\u0398[\u03b1]\ni=1\n\n\u2202zi\n\n(0)d\u03c9i (Q).\n\nThe explicit expression for the Prime form E(x, y) that has a single zero on the Riemann surface \u03a3g\nthen reads\n\u0398[\u03b1] (~x \u2212 ~y)\n.\n(36)\nE(P, Q) =\nh\u03b1 (~x)h\u03b1 (~y )\nWe can now express the 2-point resolvent W0 (p, q) in terms of B(P, Q). Let us denote p and p the\npoints on the respective physical and unphysical sheets. Then,\ndp dq\n\u2202V \u2032 (p)\n= \u2212B(p, q) \u2212 B(p, q) = \u2212\n\u2202V (q)\n(p \u2212 q)2\nsince it has double poles with unit quadratic residues at p = q and p = q. The 2-point resolvent (18)\nis nonsingular at coinciding points; therefore,\n1\n\u2202y(p)\n= \u2212 (B(p, q) \u2212 B(p, q)),\n\u2202V (q)\n2\n\n(37)\n\nW0 (p, q) = \u2212B(p, q).\n\n(38)\n\nand\n\n3.2\n\nThe iterative procedure\n\nWe can determine higher genus contributions iteratively by inverting genus expanded loop equation\n(10). All multi-point resolvents of the same genus can be obtained from Wg (p) merely by applying\nthe loop insertion operator \u2202V\u2202(p) .\nClaiming all the higher free energy terms Fg to depend only on \u03bc\u03b1 and a finite number of the\n(k)\nmoments M\u03b1 , which are derivatives of (k \u2212 1)th order of the polynomial M (p) at branching points,\nallows no freedom of adding the terms depending only on t0 and Si to Fg .\nc \u2212 2W0 (p) acting on\nWe first prove that the operator K\nI\n\nCD\n\ndEq,q0 (p)\n\ndq 1\nf (q),\n2\u03c0i 2y(q)\n\n(39)\n\nwhere f (q) is the combination of resolvents in the r.h.s. of (10) whose only singularities are poles of\nfinite orders at \u03bc\u03b1 and the point p lies outside CD , just gives f (p).\n\nFor this, we first note that as V \u2032 (\u03be) has no square root singularities at \u03bc\u03b1 , instead of evaluating\nthe integral over CD , we can just evaluate residues on Riemann surface (19) w.r.t. the variables \u03be and\n7\n\n\fq. (This effectively corresponds to doubling the integral over CD and it gives additional factor 1/2.)\nWe therefore denote C (\u03be) the contour that encircles all branching points of \u1ef9(\u03be) and assume that the\ncontour C (q) of integration w.r.t. the variable q lies inside C (\u03be) .\n\nWe now implement the Riemann bilinear identities. The contributions of A- and B-cycle integrations vanish due to (25) and (30). Following (18), we substitute 2(W0 (\u03be) + y(\u03be)) for V \u2032 (\u03be) in (11)\nand calculate the part with W0 (\u03be) taking the contour of integration to the infinity; the integrand with\ndEq,q0 (\u03be) is regular, and the only contribution comes from poles at \u03be = p and \u03be = p; this contribution\nexactly cancels the term \u22122W0 (p).\nThe remaining integral is\n\n\u2212\n\nI\n\np>C (\u03be) >C (q)\n\nf (q)\nd\u03be dq y(\u03be) \u1ef9(p)\ndEq,q0 (\u03be)\n.\n2\u03c0i 2\u03c0i p \u2212 \u03be \u1ef9(\u03be)\n2y(q)\n\nSince y(\u03be)/\u1ef9(\u03be) = M (\u03be) is regular at \u03be = \u03bc\u03b1 , pushing the integration contour C (\u03be) through C (q) we\nobtain zero upon the integration over \u03be, and the only nonzero contribution comes from the simple pole\nof dEq,q0 (\u03be) \u223c 1/(\u03be \u2212 q) at \u03be = q. Terms with y(q) in the numerator and denominator then cancel each\nother and the remaining integral w.r.t. q can be taken pushing the contour again to infinity evaluating\nthe residues at q = p and q = p, which gives 21 (f (p) + f (p)) = f (p) for a function analytic in p outside\nthe branching points.\nThis provides a basis for the diagrammatic representation for resolvents in 1MM [20]. Let us\nrepresent the form dEq,q0 (p) as the vector directed from p to q, the three-point vertex as the dot\nH dq 1\nin which we assume the integration over q, \u2022 \u2261 2\u03c0i\n2y(q) , and the Bergmann 2-form B(p, q) as a\nnonarrowed edge connecting points p and q. The graphic representation for a solution of (10) then\nlooks as follows. Representing the multiresolvent Wg\u2032 (p1 , . . . , ps ) as the block with s external legs and\nwith the index g \u2032 , we obtain [20]\n\np\n\nr\n\n\u271b\u2718\n\n\u272c \u2729\ng \u2212 g\u2032\n\u271b\u2718\ng\u22121\np q\nP p q \u271a\u2719\nr \u2732 \u2709\u271b \u2718\ng\n=\n+ r \u2732\u2709 g\u22121 ,\n\u2032\n\u2745\n\u2745\ng =1\n\u2745\n\u271a\u2719\ng\u2032\n\u272b \u272a\n\u271a\u2719\n\n(40)\n\nwhich provides the diagrammatic representation for Wk (p1 , . . . , ps ). The multiresolvent Wk (p1 , . . . , ps )\ncan be presented as a finite sum of all possible connected graphs with k loops and s external legs and\nwith only three-valent internal vertices (the total number of edges is then 2s + 3k \u2212 3, and we assume\ns \u2265 1 for k \u2265 1 and s \u2265 3 for k = 0). We also set arrows on some (exactly 2k + s \u2212 2) of edges for\nthe arrowed edges to constitute the rooted tree subgraph with all arrows directed from the root. That\nmeans that we choose one of the external legs, say, p1 (the choice is arbitrary due to the symmetry\nof Wk (p1 , . . . , ps )), to be the root vertex the tree starts with; for each three-valent vertex there must\nexist exactly one incoming edge of the tree subgraph, all external edges (except the root edge) are\nnonarrowed, and all internal nonarrowed edges either start and terminate at the same vertex (we then\nassociate with such an edge the Bergmann differential B(p, p)) or connect two different vertices such\nthat there exists the directed path composed\nby arrowed edges connecting these two vertices. At each\nH\ndq\n1\ninternal vertex we have the integration C (q) 2\u03c0i\n2y(q) , while the arrangement of the integration contours\nat different vertices is prescribed by the arrowed subtree: the closer is a vertex to the root, the more\nouter is the integration contour.\nWe now demonstrate the consistency of this diagram technique by calculating the action of loop\ninsertion operator (7) on its elements.\nWe first calculate the action of \u2202/\u2202V (r) on B(P, Q). Using (29), we represent this action through\nthe action of partial derivatives in \u03bc\u03b1 subsequently calculating the latter from relation (37). Let\n\u221a\n\u221a\ny(x)dx|x\u2192\u03bc\u03b1 = y([\u03bc\u03b1 ]) x \u2212 \u03bc\u03b1 dx + O( x \u2212 \u03bc\u03b1 )3 dx.\n8\n\n\fThen, since\n\u2202y(p)dp\n\u2202V (r)\nwe have\n\np\u2192\u03bc\u03b1\n\n\u2202\u03bc\u03b1\n1\ndp\n\u2243 \u2212 y([\u03bc\u03b1 ]) \u221a\n,\n2\np \u2212 \u03bc\u03b1 \u2202V (r)\n\n2B([\u03bc\u03b1 ], q)\n\u2202\u03bc\u03b1\n=\n\u2202V (r)\ny([\u03bc\u03b1 ]),\n\n(41)\n\n2n\nX\nB(P, [\u03bc\u03b1 ])B([\u03bc\u03b1 ], Q)B([\u03bc\u03b1 ], r)\n\u2202\nB(P, Q) =\n.\n\u2202V (r)\ny([\u03bc\u03b1 ])\n\u03b1=1\n\n(42)\n\nand, therefore\n\nFor expressing this in terms of the differentials, we integrate one of the Bergmann bidifferentials in\norder to obtain the 1-differential dEQ,Q0 (\u03be).6 Note that the local variable in the vicinity of \u03bc\u03b1 is\n\u221a\n\u03be(x) = x \u2212 \u03bc\u03b1 , this gives the additional factor 1/2, and we eventually obtain\n2n\nX\nB(P, \u03be(x))dE\u03be(x),Q0 (Q)B(\u03be(x), r)\n\u2202\nB(P, Q) =\nres\u03bc\u03b1\n.\n\u2202V (r)\n2y(xi(x))d\u03be(x)\n\u03b1=1\n\n(43)\n\nFrom this relation it obviously follows that\n2n\nX\ndEP,Q0 (\u03be(x))dE\u03be(x),Q0 (Q)B(\u03be(x), r)\n\u2202\ndEP,Q0 (Q) =\nres\u03bc\u03b1\n,\n\u2202V (r)\n2y(xi(x))d\u03be(x)\n\u03b1=1\n\n(44)\n\nand the last quantity to evaluate is\n1\nB(p, r)\n\u2202\n=\u2212 2\n.\n\u2202V (r) 2y(p)\n2y (p)\n\n(45)\n\nNote that the point P in (44) is outside the integration contour. (This is irrelevant in formula (43)\nas the Bergmann bidifferential has zero residue at the coinciding arguments, in contrast to dEP,Q0 (Q).\nMultiplying by 1/(2y(P )) both sides of (44), using (45), and pushing the integration contour through\nthe point P , we observe that the contribution of the simple pole of dEP,Q0 (\u03be(x)) at \u03be(x) = P cancels\nexactly the variation of 1/(2y(P )). We therefore attain the prescribed contour ordering and can\ngraphically present the action of \u2202/\u2202V (r) as\nr\n\u2202\n\u2202V (r)\n\nQ\n\n\u2732 P = Q \u2732r \u2732 P,\n\nr\n\u2202\n\u2202V (r)\n\nQ\n\nP = Q \u2732r\n\nr\nP \u2261 Q\n\nr\u271b P .\n\n(46)\nIn the second case, it is our choice on which of edges to set the arrow. Recall, however, that the points\nP and Q were already ordered as prescribed by the diagram technique. That is, if \"P \u2192 Q\", we must\nchoose the first variant and if \"Q \u2192 P \", we must choose the second variant of arrows arrangement.\n6\n\nThis differs from the commonly accepted viewpoint that one should instead take the primitive of y(\u03be).

We now calculate the action of H on\nthe Bergmann bidifferential B(x, q) using again the Riemann bilinear identities. We first note that\nB(x, q) = \u2202x dEx,Q0 (q) and we can evaluate residues at infinities by parts. Then, since dEx,Q0 (q) is\nregular at infinities, we substitute for V \u2032 (x) 2y(x) + 2t0 /x as x \u2192 \u221e+ and \u22122y(x) + 2t0 /x as x \u2192 \u221e\u2212\nthus obtaining\n\u2212res\u221e+\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nt0\nt0\ny(x) +\ndEx,Q0 (q)dx + res\u221e\u2212 \u2212y(x) +\ndEx,Q0 (q)dx\nx\nx\n\n\u2212t0 dEx,Q0 (q)\n\nx=\u221e+\n\n\u2212\n\nx=\u221e\u2212\n\nn\u22121\nX\ni=1\n\nSi\n\nI\n\nB(q, x),\n\n(48)\n\nBi\n\nwhence the cancelation of terms containing t0 is obvious, and it remains to take the combination\nof residues at infinities involving y(x). For this, we cut the surface along A- and B-cycles taking\ninto account the residue at x = q. The boundary integrals on two sides of the cut at Bi then\ndiffer by dEx,Q0 (q) \u2212 dEx+H ,Q0 (q) = 0, while the integrals on two sides of the cut at Ai differ by\ndEx,Q0 (q) \u2212 dEx+H\n\nBi\n\nH\n\nAi\n\n,Q0 (q) =\n\nBi\n\nB(q, x), and we obtain for the boundary term the expression\nn\u22121\nXI\ni=1\n\ny(x)dx\n\nAi\n\nI\n\nB(q, \u03be),\nBi\n\nwhich exactly cancel the last term in (48). It remains only the contribution from the pole at x = q,\nwhich is just \u2212y(q). We have therefore proved that\nH * B(*, q) = \u2212y(q)dq.\n\n(49)\n\nLet us now consider the action of H on Wk (*) subsequently evaluating the action of loop insertion\noperator (7) on the result. Note first that the only result of action of \u2202/\u2202V (p) on the operator H\nitself are derivatives \u2202V (x)/\u2202V (p) = \u22121/(p \u2212 x) (and recall that by definition |p| > |x|, i.e., instead\nof evaluating residues at infinities one should take residues at x = p, and we obtain\n\u2202\n(H * Wk (*)) = Wk (p) + H * Wk (*, p).\n\u2202V (p)\n\n(50)\n\n7\nThis definition works well when acting on 1-forms regular at infinities. Otherwise (say, in the case of W0 (p)), the\nintegral in the third term must be regularized, e.g., by replacing it by the contour integral around the logarithmic cut\nstretched between two infinities.\n\n10\n\n\fFor the second term, due to the symmetry of Wk (p, q), we may take the point p as the root of the tree\nsubgraph. Then, the operator H always acts on B(*, \u03be) where \u03be are integration variables of internal\nvertices. However, if this vertex is an innermost (i.e., there is no arrowed edges coming out of it), then\nthe 1-form y(\u03be)d\u03be arising under the action of H (49) cancels the corresponding form in the integration\nexpression, and the residue vanishes being nonsingular at the branching point. If there is an outgoing\narrowed edge, say dE\u03c1,Q0 (\u03be) (can be just one as one line is external), then, again, we can push the\nintegration contour for \u03be through the one for \u03c1; the only contribution comes again only from the pole\nat \u03be = \u03c1. The value of the residue is doubled, and we come to the following graphical representation\nfor the action of the operator H:\nH*\n\nH*\n\nQ \u2732r \u2732 P = \u2212 Q\n\n\u2732P ;\n\nQ \u2732r\n\nP = 0.\n(51)\n\nFor Hq * Wk (q, p) = Hq * \u2202V\u2202(q) Wk (p), we obtain that for each arrowed edge on which the action of (7)\nproduces the new vertex, the inverse action of Hq * just give the factor \u22121 and on each nonarrowed\nedge on which the action of (7) produces the new vertex, the inverse action of Hq * just gives zero. As\nthe total number of arrowed edges is 2k \u2212 1 for any graph contributing to the sum of diagrams, we\nobtain that\nHq * Wk (q, p) = \u2212(2k \u2212 1)Wk (p)\nand, combining with (50), we just obtain\n\u2202\n\u2202\n(Hq * Wk (q)) = \u2212(2 \u2212 2k)\nFk ,\n\u2202V (p)\n\u2202V (p)\n\n(52)\n\nand, since all the dependence on filling fractions and t0 is fixed by the claim that the answer depends\nonly on \u03bc\u03b1 and derivatives of M (p) of finite orders at the branching points, we conclude that\nFk =\n\n1\nH * Wk .\n2k \u2212 2\n\n(53)\n\nThis is our final answer for the free energy. It permits us to calculate all Fk except the contribution\nat k = 1 (torus approximation). It was however calculated by a direct integration in [21]. All other\norders can\nR be consistently calculated. For this, we only introduce one new vertex \u25e6 in which we have\n\nH\n\n\u03be\n\nR\n\ny(s)ds\n\nR\n\n. Although the integral term Q\u03be 0 y(s)ds is nonlocal, its constant part Q\u03bc0\u03b1 drops out\nof the residue in the 1MM case, and we can integrate it in the neighborhoods of every branching point\n\u03bc\u03b1 separately. That is, we need only the expansion of this integral as \u03be \u2192 \u03bc\u03b1 .

Indeed, coming back to basics of the matrix model, note that\nthe operator in (59) just generates the scaling transformations: the part with derivatives w.r.t. tk\nmultiplies all vertices by the same scaling factor \u03c1 simultaneously multiplying propagators by \u03c1\u22121 .\nThe action of derivatives in t0 and Si results in multiplying all index loops (faces of the fat graph) by\n\u03c1.
