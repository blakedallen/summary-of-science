INTRODUCTION\n\nHighly ionized gas is ubiquitous in galactic halos at high redshift. This is known from the detection of C IV and O VI absorption in damped\nLyman-\u03b1 (DLA, i.e. systems with log NH I > 20.3;\nLedoux et al. 1998; Wolfe & Prochaska 2000; Fox et al.\n2007a,b) and sub-DLAs (systems with 19.0<log NH I <\n20.3; Dessauges-Zavadsky et al. 2003; P\u00e9roux et al. 2003,\n2007). These studies have found that C IV is present in\nevery DLA where data exists, and that O VI absorption,\ntracing a hotter phase of gas, is present in at least 40% of\nDLAs. Detections of C IV and O VI absorption have also\nbeen reported (Bergeron et al. 1994; Kirkman & Tytler\n1997, 1999) in Lyman Limit Systems (LLSs), a lower H I\ncolumn density class of QSO absorber that may be tracing the extended outer regions of galactic halos.\nPhysically, there are two principal processes that\nare expected to generate hot plasma in galactic halos.\nThe first is star formation, which leads to\nsupernovae and the subsequent production of hot,\nshock-heated interstellar gas, possibly in the form of\nwinds (Oppenheimer & Dav\u00e9 2006; Kawata & Rauch\n2007; Fangano et al. 2007). The second is accretion,\nwhich results in the shock-heating of infalling intergalactic gas to temperatures of 105\u22127 K (Dav\u00e9 et al. 2001;\nFang & Bryan 2003; Kang et al. 2005). Given the low\nmetallicities and low densities expected in these hot\n\u2217 BASED\n\nON OBSERVATIONS TAKEN UNDER PROGRAMME\nIDS 072.A-0442(A) AND 078.A-0164(A) WITH THE ULTRAVIOLET AND VISUAL ECHELLE SPECTROGRAPH (UVES) ON\nTHE VERY LARGE TELESCOPE (VLT) UNIT 2 (KUEYEN)\nAT PARANAL, CHILE, OPERATED BY ESO.\n1 Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris, UMR 7095 CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, 98bis, Boulevard Arago, 75014 Paris,\nFrance; fox@iap.fr\n2 LERMA, Observatoire de Paris, 61 Avenue de l'Observatoire,\n75014 Paris, France; ppetitje@iap.fr\n3 European Southern Observatory, Alonso de C\u00f3rdova 3107,\nCasilla 19001, Vitacura, Santiago 19, Chile; cledoux@eso.org\n4 IUCAA, Post Bag 4, Ganesh Khind, Pune 411 007, India;\nanand@iucaa.ernet.in\n\nhalo environments, the cooling times will be very long\n(& 1010 yr for gas at T = 106 K, 0.01 solar metallicity, and n = 10\u22123 cm\u22123 ), enabling metals to become locked up. Indeed, approximately half of the\nmetals produced in stars by a redshift of two are\nyet to be observed (Bouch\u00e9 et al. 2005, 2006, 2007;\nSommer-Larsen & Fynbo 2007), and hot halos represent\na potential harbor for these metals.\nIt has recently become apparent that sub-damped\nLyman-\u03b1 systems (sub-DLAs, with 19.0 < log NH I < 20.3,\nalso known as a Super-LLSs) play a significant role in the\nmetal budget (P\u00e9roux et al. 2005, 2007; Prochaska et al.\n2006; Kulkarni et al. 2007), but the contribution of the\nO VI-phase in sub-DLAs has not been studied before; indeed, we are aware of only one other published detection\nof O VI in a sub-DLA (Simcoe et al. 2002). We present\nin this paper observations and ionization modelling of a\nsub-DLA showing a detection of O VI.\n2. OBSERVATIONS\n\nThe spectra of QSO Q0331-4505 were taken with\nthe Ultraviolet-Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES;\nDekker et al. 2000) at the 8.2m Very Large Telescope\nUnit 2 (VLT/UT2) at Paranal, Chile during observing runs in 2003 and 2006.\nThe data reduction\nwas performed using the UVES pipeline described in\nBallester et al. (2000). The spectra were co-added in\nwavelength regions covered in both runs, and have a spectral resolution (FWHM) of 6.6 km s\u22121 (R=45 000).\nA strong Lyman-\u03b1 absorber exists in the spectrum at\nzabs = 2.65618. This redshift is measured using the velocity of the strongest component of absorption in Si II\n\u03bb1304, and defines the velocity zero-point in the following\ndiscussion. Using a Voigt profile fit to the damping wings\nof the Lyman-\u03b1 line, we find log NH I = 19.82\u00b10.05, identifying the absorber as a sub-DLA. In Figure 1 we show\nthe absorption line profiles of O I, C II, Si II, Fe II, Al II,\nFe III, C III, Si III, Si IV, C IV, and O VI, which all\nshow detections in the sub-DLA.

Both lines of the O VI doublet display identical optical depth profiles over a velocity range\nof 175 km s\u22121 , verifying the genuine detection of O VI\nabsorption, free from blending with the Lyman-\u03b1 forest.\nVoigt profile fits were conducted using the VPFIT software package5, and are included in Figure 1. The fits\nto each ion were completely independent. A summary of\nthe key properties of the sub-DLA is given in Table 1.\nWe identify three principal components of low-ion absorption, at \u221255, 0, and 20 km s\u22121 , which we name C1,\nC2, and C3, respectively. C2 is the strongest component.\nC3 is implied by the need to fit the positive-velocity wing\nof the low-ion lines, but its column density is relatively\nlow, so we ignore it in the following discussion. C1 and\nC2 are all seen in O I, Si II, Al II, Fe II, C II, C III, Si III,\nand Si IV, and C IV. We also identify two components of\nhigh-ion absorption seen in O VI and C IV, at \u2212100 and\n\u221260 km s\u22121 , which we designate H1 and H2, respectively.\nThe C IV seen near \u221260 km s\u22121 may have contributions\nfrom both H2 and C1.\n3. PROXIMITY TO THE QUASAR\n\nProximate absorbers separated from the background\nquasar by dv <5 000 km s\u22121 [sometimes dv <3 000 km s\u22121 ,\nwhere dv=c|zqso \u2212 zabs |/(1 + zabs )] are often removed\nfrom samples of intervening absorbers because they\nmay be either ejected or ionized (or both) by the\nQSO itself (Weymann et al. 1979; Foltz et al. 1986).\nWe measured the observed wavelengths of the N V,\nO I, C IV, He II, and C III] QSO emission lines in\nthe Q0331-4505 spectrum, and derived the QSO redshift by accounting for the average velocities of these\nlines (relative to the systemic redshift) as listed in\nTytler & Fan (1992). This yielded zqso = 2.6785 \u00b1\n0.00306, implying the sub-DLA is separated from the\nquasar by a velocity of dv = 1 820\u00b1250 km s\u22121 . Assuming a WMAP 3-year cosmology (H0 =73 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ,\n\u03a9M =0.24, \u03a9\u039b =0.76; Spergel et al. 2007), we use the relation given in Phillipps et al. (2002) to find that the Hubble parameter at z = 2.65 is H(2.65)=257 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .\nTherefore, assuming the sub-DLA motion is purely due\n5\n6\n\nAvailable at http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/\u223crfc/vpfit.html\nImproving the estimate of zqso =2.6 by Maza et al. (1993).\n\nto Hubble flow (i.e., ignoring peculiar velocities), we find\na separation of \u2248 7.1 Mpc from the quasar.\nDespite the proximity to the quasar, several lines of\nevidence suggest this sub-DLA is not an intrinsic system\narising near the central engine of the AGN: (1) the metallicity is too low (Petitjean, Rauch, & Carswell 1994); (2)\nN V, which is expected in intrinsic systems (Hamann\n1997), is not detected; (3) no excited states (e.g. C II\u2217\nor Si II\u2217 ) are seen in absorption, as would be detected in\nintrinsic absorbers (e.g. Srianand & Petitjean 2000); (4)\nthere is no evidence of partial coverage of the background\nsource, which is found in intrinsic absorbers (Arav et al.\n2005); (5) there is no evidence for temporal variability\nbetween our two observation epochs in 2003 and 2006.\n4. METALLICITY AND PHOTOIONIZATION MODELLING\n\nWe use the O I/H I ratio to determine the metallicity of the gas. Under interstellar conditions, O I\nis thought to follow H I closely due to charge exchange reactions (Field & Steigman 1971), implying that\nthe O I/H I ratio accurately determines O/H without having to apply ionization corrections. Using a\nVoigt profile fit to O I \u03bb1302 and \u03bb1039, we find\nlog N (O I)=14.84\u00b10.05 (total over the three components). Coupling this with log N (H I)=19.82\u00b10.05, we\nfind [O I/H I]=[O/H]=\u22121.64\u00b10.077\nTo determine the ionization balance in the photoionized gas, we ran a grid of CLOUDY (version C06.02,\ndescribed in Ferland et al. 1998) photoionization models\nto component C2 at different ionization parameter U \u2261\nn\u03b3 /nH . The models assume the gas exists in a planeparallel, uniform slab, and take the metallicity [O/H] and\nNHI as fixed inputs. We assume the fraction of the total\nH I column that exists in C2 is the same as the fraction\nof the total O I column in C2, which is 86%. To specify the radiation field, we take an unattenuated quasar\n(QSO) spectrum, i.e. a power-law with the form F\u03bd \u221d\n\u03bd \u22121.5 at \u03bb <1216 \u00c5 (Haardt & Madau 1996) normalized\nby the measured QSO V -band magnitude of 17.9 and\nzqso = 2.6785, which yield a total QSO luminosity at the\nLyman Limit L912 =1.2 \u00d7 1031 erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 when extrapolating the V -band flux as described in Guimar\u00e3es et al.\n(2007). Making use of the QSO-absorber luminosity distance of 7.1 Mpc, we then find that the flux of ionizing\nradiation from the QSO at the absorber is F912 =2.0 \u00d7\n10\u221221 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 Hz\u22121 , lower than the extragalactic\nbackground (EGB) at z=2.65, which has F912 =9.6 \u00d7\n10\u221221 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 Hz\u22121 (Haardt & Madau 1996). The\nQSO radiation field contains more high-energy photons\nthan the EGB, boosting the production of Si IV and\nC IV, so the radiation field we use in the CLOUDY modelling includes both the EGB and the normalized QSO\ncontribution.\nWe found the value of log U that matches the\nSi IV/Si II column density ratio measured in C2. This\nvalue, log U =\u22123.32\u00b10.10, also matches the observed O I\ncolumn density. We then found that [C/O]=\u22120.3 was\nnecessary to reproduce the column densities of C II and\n(within a 2\u03c3 error) C IV. Finally we checked that the\nmodel is consistent with the C III and Si III lower limits.\nThis model is shown in Figure 2 and is characterized by\n7 Throughout this paper we use the solar oxygen abundance\n(O/H)\u2299 = 10\u22123.34 from Asplund et al.

This\nredshift, where the strongest component of low-ion absorption falls, defines the zero-point of the velocity scale. Our overall Voigt component\nfits to each profile are shown with solid red lines. Vertical dashed lines illustrate the positions of the three low-ion components (C1, C2,\nand C3) and two high-ion components (H1 and H2). Note that in some panels, the profiles are shown over a limited y-range, for clarity.\nWe have shaded the C IV and O VI panels to highlight the different structure in the high-ion absorption profiles.\n\nFig. 2.- CLOUDY photoionization modelling of component C2,\nassuming the radiation field has contributions from both the quasar\nand the extragalactic background.

The observations are shown in red, plotted\nat the density of the best-fit model.\n\na hydrogen ionization fraction xH =0.64, and an ionized\nhydrogen column density log NH II =20.00. We assume\nthe same conditions apply in C1 and C3, giving a total\nlog NWarm H II =20.06.\nThe ionization level we derive in the low-ion phase\n(64%) is no larger than the levels derived in intervening sub-DLAs by other authors (Prochaska 1999;\nP\u00e9roux et al. 2007), reinforcing the idea that this subDLA does not show unusual properties because of its\nproximity to the quasar. The idea that many proximate\nDLAs (and by extension sub-DLAs) may be representative of the intervening population has been proposed before (e.g. Moller et al. 1998), though see Prochaska et al.\n(2007).\n5. A HIGHLY IONIZED PLASMA PHASE\n\nThe O VI and C IV profiles are clearly different from\nthe low-ion profiles, with the strongest high-ion component (H1) separated by 100 km s\u22121 from the strongest\nlow-ion component. O VI and C IV show similar profiles at \u2212150 to \u2212100 km s\u22121 , but the O VI absorption is\nsmoother and broader than the C IV in the range \u2212100 to\n0 km s\u22121 . This can be seen in Figure 3, where we compare\nthe apparent column density profiles of the two ions. The\ndifference in the profiles implies that the O VI and C IV\nare not fully co-spatial, i.e. the two ions trace different\ntemperature regions of a multi-phase structure8 . We derive a lower limit on NH II in the O VI-bearing gas using\nNHot H II = NO VI /(fO VI O/H), with an O VI ionization\nfraction fO VI = 0.2 (the maximum allowed by collisional\nionization models; see the Appendix in Tripp & Savage\n2000) and assuming that O/H in the high-ionization gas\nis the same as O/H in the low-ionization gas. This\nmethod yields log NHot H II >20.09 (total over H1 and\nH2).\nTo explore how the O VI properties of our subDLA relate to other systems, we investigated the only\nintervening sub-DLA with a published O VI detection: the system at zabs = 2.439 toward Q1442+2931\n(Simcoe et al. 2002), and the previously unpublished\nO VI profile in the sub-DLA at zabs =2.139 toward Q1037270 (Srianand & Petitjean 2001). The three sub-DLAs\nare described in Table 2. Following the same calculation\nas used here, the ratio NHotH II /NH I takes the value >12\nin the Q1442+2931 sub-DLA, and >1.0 in the Q1037-270\nsub-DLA, vs >1.9 for the sub-DLA in this paper. From\nthis we conclude that (i) in sub-DLAs, there are more\n8 Similar differences between the profiles of C IV and O VI\nhave been found before in many other environments, including the Milky Way halo (Fox et al. 2003), the Large Magellanic\nCloud (Lehner & Howk 2007), LLSs (Kirkman & Tytler 1997,\n1999), DLAs (Fox et al. 2007a), and some intergalactic absorbers\n(Simcoe et al. 2002).\n\n\f4\n\nPlasma in a Sub-DLA\n\nFig. 3.- Comparison of apparent column density profiles of\nC IV and O VI in the sub-DLA. Both ions show similar profiles at\n\u2212150 to \u2212100 km s\u22121 , but the O VI absorption is smoother and\nbroader than the C IV in the range \u2212100 to 0 km s\u22121 .\n\nbaryons in the O VI phase than there are in the form of\nH I atoms, and (ii) there is no evidence that radiation\nfrom the quasar is creating more O VI in the Q0331-4505\nsub-DLA than in intervening sub-DLAs.\n6. CONTRIBUTION OF SUB-DLAS TO \u03a9\n\nThe latest determination of the cosmic density in\nDLA\nH I atoms in sub-DLAs is \u03a9sub\n=1.5 \u00d7 10\u22124\nHI\n(O'Meara et al. 2007). In order to fully account for\nthe contribution of ionized gas in sub-DLAs, it is necessary to determine the average ionized-to-neutral ratio hNTotal H II /NH I i, where NTotal H II = NWarm H II +\nNHot H II . The value of NWarm H II /NH I has been investigated by P\u00e9roux et al. (2007), who report a mean ionization fraction of 0.68 in 26 sub-DLAs modelled with\nCLOUDY, corresponding to hNWarm H II /NH I i=2.1. The\nvalue of the NHot H II /NH I is not well constrained: as discussed in \u00a75, the derived values in the three existing subDLAs with O VI are >1.0, >1.9 and >12. Assuming that\nthe mean NHot H II /NH I in sub-DLAs lies somewhere between these measurements, we find that hNTotal H II /NH I i\n\nis between 3.1 and 14. Thus, the total baryon content of\nDLA\nsub DLA\nsub-DLAs \u03a9sub\nis\nH I+H II = (1 + hNTotal H II /NH I i)\u03a9H I\n\u22124\n\u22123\nbetween 6.1 \u00d7 10 and 2.2 \u00d7 10 .\nThe total contribution of sub-DLAs to the metal\nDLA\nbudget then follows according to: \u03a9sub\n=\nZ,H I+H II\nsub DLA\nhZ/Hi\u03a9H I+H II . Assuming a typical sub-DLA metallicity\nDLA\nof h[Z/H]i=\u22120.8 (Kulkarni et al. 2007), then \u03a9sub\nZ,H I+H II\nis between 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22126 and 6.7 \u00d7 10\u22126, i.e between 6% and\n22% of all the metals produced by star formation up to\nz \u2248 2 (using a value for the total \u03a9Z from star formation of 3.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 ; Ferrara et al. 2005). For comparison,\n\u22127\n\u03a9DLA\n(including both the neutral and\nZ,H I+H II \u2248 6 \u00d7 10\nhighly ionized phases; Prochaska et al. 2005; Fox et al.\n2007a). This calculation shows that globally there are\nat least three times more metal atoms in sub-DLAs than\nDLAs, owing to both the higher mean metallicity and\nthe higher mean ionization level in sub-DLAs.\nThere are several reasons why this estimate of \u03a9Z in\nsub-DLAs could rise. First, recent detections of subDLAs with super-solar metallicity (Khare et al. 2004;\nProchaska et al. 2006; P\u00e9roux et al. 2006) may imply the\nmean sub-DLA metallicity is higher than \u22120.8. Second,\nthe typical temperature of the O VI-bearing gas in subDLAs may be above 3\u00d7 105 K, implying the O VI ionization fraction will be lower than 0.2 (Sutherland & Dopita\n1993). Finally, if the O VI-bearing gas was generated by\nthe accretion and shock-heating of intergalactic gas, the\nionized gas may have lower metallicity than the neutral\ngas (increasing NHot H II ). Each of these effects would\nserve to increase \u03a9Z above the 6\u201322% level discussed\nhere.\n\nAJF gratefully acknowledges support from a Marie\nCurie Intra-European Fellowship awarded by the European Union Sixth Framework Programme.
