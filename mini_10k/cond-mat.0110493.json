We propose a toy model with reversible mode coupling mechanism\nand with trivial Hamiltonian (and hence trivial statics). The model can be\nanalyzed exactly without relying upon uncontrolled approximation such as the\nfactorization approximation employed in the current MCT. We show that the\nmodel exhibits a kinetically driven transition from an ergodic phase to nonergodic\nphase. The nonergodic state is the nonequilibrium stationary solution of the\nFokker-Planck equation for the distribution function of the model.\n\n1. Introduction\nFirst-principles understanding on the rich dynamic phenomena and the nature of the\nliquid-glass transition still remains as a challenging aim [1]. As the only existing\nfirst-principle theory, the mode coupling theory (MCT) of supercooled liquids and\nthe glass transition enjoyed considerable success in describing the dynamics of weakly\nsupercooled regime of liquids [2]. Notwithstanding this surprising success, there are\nthe following several unresolved issues concerning the basis of MCT: (a) A crucial\ningredient of MCT is the factorization approximation which replaces the four-body\ntime correlation functions by the product of two-body time correlation functions. This\napproximation is completely uncontrolled and its region of validity is a priori unknown.\n(b) The idealized MCT predicts a sharp dynamic transition to a nonergodic state at\na certain temperature. But MCT does not provide any information on the nature of\nthis nonergodic state. (c) The physical picture of the so called hopping processes in\nan extended version of MCT is still lacking.\nIn recent years, possible deep connection between the structural glass and a class\nof spin glass models has been pointed out [3]. In particular, the Langevin dynamics\nof the spherical p-spin model can be analyzed exactly in the thermodynamic limit\ndue to the mean field nature of the model (i.e., full connectivity of the spins) [4, 5].\nThis analysis shows that the dynamic equation for the spin correlation function in\nequilibrium for p = 3 has the same form as in the Leutheusser's schematic mode\ncoupling equation for the density correlator [6]. The sharp dynamic transition observed\nin this class of models are driven by the dissipative nonlinearity in the equation of\nmotion which originates from the nonlinear Hamiltonian [7]. In contrast to this, the\n\u00a7 Permanent address: 4-37-9 Takamidai, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 811-0215, Japan\n\n\f2\n\nKinetically driven glassy transition\n\nglassy behavior in the above-mentioned MCT (as well as in our model given below)\nis driven by the reversible nonlinearity [8] which is dynamically generated and hence\na non-trivial Hamiltonian is not necessary.\nWith these situations, we thought that it is important to develop a toy model\nwith following three ingredients:\n\u2022 reversible mode coupling mechanism\n\u2022 trivial statics\n\u2022 mean-field type so that the model can be exactly solvable.\n\nWe have proposed such a toy model in a recent publication [9]. Here we further analyze\nthe model. The model yields the self-consistent equations for the relevant correlation\nfunctions of the type familiar in the mode coupling theories of supercooled liquid and\nglass transition, where the strength of the hopping processes can be readily tuned. In\nthe sense that the glassy behavior in this toy model is induced by the kinetics of the\nreversible mode coupling mechanism, our model is similar in spirit to the kinetically\nconstrained models, the theme of the present workshop.\n2. Model\nOur model is defined as the following Langevin equations for the N -component density\nvariable ai (t) with i = 1, 2, * * * , N and the M -component velocity variable b\u03b1 with\n\u03b1 = i, 2, * * * , M . Here and after we will use Roman indices for the component of a and\nGreek for that of b.\n\u03c9\n\u0227i = Ki\u03b1 b\u03b1 + \u221a Jij\u03b1 aj b\u03b1\n(1)\nN\n\u03c9\n(2)\n\u1e03\u03b1 = \u2212\u03b3b\u03b1 \u2212 \u03c9 2 Kj\u03b1 aj \u2212 \u221a Jij\u03b1 (\u03c9 2 ai aj \u2212 T \u03b4ij ) + f\u03b1\nN\n< f\u03b1 (t) >= 0,\n< f\u03b1 (t)f\u03b2 (t\u2032 ) >= 2\u03b3T \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\n(3)\n\nwhere the summation is implied for repeated indices. Here \u03b3 is the decay rate of the\nvelocity b\u03b1 and \u03c9 gives the j-independent frequency of oscillation of the density aj .\nThe thermal noise f\u03b1 (t) are independent gaussian random variables with zero mean\nand variance 2\u03b3T , T being the temperature of the heat bath with which the system\nhas a thermal contact. The choice of this variance guarantees the proper equilibration\nof the system. The N \u00d7 M matrix Ki\u03b1 plays an important role in the model and for\nlater purpose we impose the (one-sided) orthogonality\nKi\u03b1 Ki\u03b2 = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n\nKi\u03b1 Kj\u03b1 6= \u03b4ij\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the last equation is due to the inequality M < N . For M = N we can impose an\nadditional condition Ki\u03b1 = \u03b4i\u03b1 and hence trivially Ki\u03b1 Kj\u03b1 = \u03b4ij . We also note that\nKi\u03b1 governs linearized reversible dynamics of the model with the dynamical matrix\n\u03a9 given by \u03a9ij \u2261 \u03c9 2 Ki\u03b1 Kj\u03b1 . The reversible nonlinear mode coupling terms are the\nones involving the mode coupling coefficients Jij\u03b1 which are chosen to be quenched\n(time-independent) gaussian random variables with the following properties:\nJij\u03b1\n\nJ\n\nJij\u03b1 Jkl\u03b2\n\n= 0,\nJ\n\n\u0014\ng2\n=\n(\u03b4ik \u03b4jl + \u03b4il \u03b4jk )\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 + Ki\u03b2 (Kk\u03b1 \u03b4jl + Kl\u03b1 \u03b4jk )\nN\n\u0015\n+ Kj\u03b2 (Kk\u03b1 \u03b4il + Kl\u03b1 \u03b4ik )\n\n(5)\n\n\fKinetically driven glassy transition\n\n3\n\nwhere * * *J denotes average over the J's. Note that there is no thermal noise which acts\ndirectly on the density variable in (1). This is because the model is constructed so as\nto mimic the dynamics of fluid. Equation (1) is analogous to the equation of continuity\nof fluid and Eq.(2) is like the equation of motion where the right hand side is like the\nforce acting on a fluid element. In constructing this model, we were motivated by the\nworks [10, 11] in which random coupling models involving an infinite component order\nparameter have been shown to be exactly analyzed by mean-field-type concepts. We\nwill thus eventually take N and M infinite with the ratio \u03b4 \u2217 \u2261 M/N kept finite.\nOne can derive from the Langevin equations (1)-(3) the corresponding FokkerPlanck equation for the probability distribution function D({a}, {b}, t) for our variable\nset denoted as {a}, {b} as follows\n\u2202t D({a}, {b}, t) = L\u0302D({a}, {b}, t)\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the Fokker-Planck operator is given by L\u0302 = L\u03020 + L\u03021 + L\u0302MC\nwith\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202 2\nL\u03020 \u2261\n\u03b3 T\n+ b\u03b1 , L\u03021 \u2261 Kj\u03b1 \u2212\nb\u03b1 +\n\u03c9 aj ,\n\u2202b\u03b1\n\u2202b\u03b1\n\u2202aj\n\u2202b\u03b1\n\u0013\n(7)\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u2202\n1\n\u03c9aj b\u03b1 +\n\u03c9(\u03c9 2 ai aj \u2212 T \u03b4ij )\nL\u0302MC \u2261 \u221a Jij\u03b1 \u2212\n\u2202ai\n\u2202b\u03b1\nN\nIt is then easy to show that the equilibrium stationary distribution (i.e., L\u0302De (a, b) = 0)\nis given by\nPN \u03c9 2 2 PM 1 2\na \u2212\nb\n\u2212\n\u03b1=1 2T \u03b1\nj=1 2T j\n(8)\nDe ({a}, {b}) = cst.e\n\nwhere cst. is the normalization factor.\n3. Analysis and discussion\n\nFor the subsequent analysis it is most convenient to introduce the following generating\nfunctional\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nR\na\na\nb\nb\n\u1e90{ha , \u0125a , hb , \u0125b } \u2261 d{a} d{b} d{\u00e2} d{b\u0302}ei dt(hj aj +\u0125j \u00e2j +h\u03b1 b\u03b1 +\u0125\u03b1 b\u0302\u03b1 ) e\u015c (9)\nwhere the integrals are the functional integrals over the variable sets {a}, {\u00e2}, {b}, {b\u0302}\nand the h's and the \u0125's the conjugate source fields. The action \u015c was decomposed\ninto two parts \u015c0 and \u015cI which take the form\nZ\nn\n\u0001o\n\u0001\n(10)\n\u015c0 = dt i\u00e2i \u0227i \u2212 Ki\u03b1 b\u03b1 + ib\u0302\u03b1 \u1e03\u03b1 + \u03b3b\u03b1 + \u03c9 2 Ki\u03b1 ai \u2212 f\u03b1 (t)\n\n(11)\n\u015cI = Jjk\u03b1 X\u0302jk\u03b1\nZ\no\nn\n\u03c9\nX\u0302jk\u03b1 \u2261 \u221a\n(12)\ndt \u2212i\u00e2j ak b\u03b1 + ib\u0302\u03b1 \u03c9 2 aj ak (t)\nN\nwhere we have dropped the term T \u03b4ij coming from eq.(2) since this term is negligible\nin the limit of infinite M and N . The functional determinant associated with the\nLangevin equations (1)-(3) which should appear in the integrand of the generating\nfunctional \u1e90 was equated to unity assuming the It\u00f4 calculus [12]. The various\ncorrelation functions and response functions are obtained by taking various functional\nderivatives of ln Z{ha , \u0125a , hb , \u0125b } with respect to h's and \u0125's and setting them equal to\n\n\f4\n\nKinetically driven glassy transition\n\nzero in the end in the standard way, where Z is the generating functional \u1e90, averaged\nover the f 's and the J's.\nWe now note that the replacements i\u00e2j \u2192 (\u03c9 2 /T )aj , b\u0302\u03b1 \u2192 b\u03b1 /T in X\u0302jk\u03b1 leads\nto X\u0302jk\u03b1 = 0.

The\nfirst equality is due to the time translation invariance and the second one from the\ntime reversal property of the velocity components. Note that for \u03b4 \u2217 = 1 the two\ncorrelators CaL (z) and CaKL (z) become identical.\n\n\f7\n\nKinetically driven glassy transition\nSimilarly, from (34)-(35), we obtain\nL\nCab\n(z) =\n\nCbL (z) =\n\nT (1 \u2212 \u03a3L\nab (z))\nL\n2\n(z + \u03a3aa (z))(z + \u03b3 + \u03a3bb (z)) + \u03c9 2 (1 \u2212 \u03a3L\nab (z))\n(z +\n\n\u03a3L\naa (z))(z\n\nT (z + \u03a3L\naa (z))\n2\n+ \u03b3 + \u03a3bb (z)) + \u03c9 2 (1 \u2212 \u03a3L\nab (z))\n\n(40)\n(41)\n\nNow let us look at the behavior of the correlators for different values of \u03b4 \u2217 .

(B)\nfirst calculate with \u03b4 \u2217 > 0 and then take the limit \u03b4 \u2217 \u2192 0+. The procesure (A)\ngives both Ca (t) = Ca (0) = T /\u03c9 2 and CaK (t) = CaK (0) = T /\u03c9 2 . This is simply\ndue to the fact that the {a} variables are time-independent since there is no velocity\nvariable {b} that drives dynamics of {a}. However the results (42)-(45) were obtained\nby adopting the second limiting procedure (B). Here Ca (t) is trivially nonergodic:\nCa (t) = Ca (0) = T /\u03c9 2 whereas and CaK (t) exhibits a nontrivial nonergodic behavior:\nCaK (t \u2192 \u221e) = (T /\u03c9 2 ) * 2g 2 T /(1 + 2g 2T ). The difference between these two procedures\ncan be seen also by looking at (33) for CaKL (z). The terms except the first one on\nthe right hand side is absent if the first limiting procedure (A) is adopted, whereas it\nremains finite in the second limiting procedure (B).\nFor \u03b4 \u2217 = 1 where M = N and Ki\u03b1 = \u03b4i\u03b1 , CaL (z) = CaKL (z) reproduces the\nequation derived in [14], apart from the wave number dependence. Note that if we\nL\nput \u03a3L\naa (z) = \u03a3ab (z) = 0 by hand, (36) or (37) gives a closed equation for Ca (t)\nalone. This equation is nothing but the Leutheusser's schematic MC equation giving\na dynamic transition from ergodic phase to nonergodic one. But in reality \u03a3aa and\n\u03a3ab can not be ignored and our numerical solution strongly indicates that the system\nremains ergodic for all temperatures due to the strong contribution of these so called\nhopping terms. Furthermore these hopping terms do not become self-consistently\nsmall as temperature is lowered. Therefore the density correlator does not show a\ncontinuous slowing down with lowering temperature. This result was striking to us\nsince usually a mean-field-type theory, such as the dynamics of the spherical p-spin\nmodel in the limit of N \u2192 \u221e, often gives a sharp dynamic transition. In fact, we were\nfirst constructing the toy model with M = N and we expected that the model designed\nto rigorously reproduce the idealized MCT exhibits such a dynamic transition. But to\nour surprise the dynamic transition was absent in the N -component toy model. This\naspect is a fundamental difference in the two kinds of mean-field-type theories with and\nwithout reversible mode coupling. The foremost example of the latter is the sherical\np-spin model where the ergodic-to-nonergodic transition is driven by the dissipative\nnonlinearity which comes from the nonlinear random Hamiltonian.

Thus it\nis very difficult to understand the idealized MCT without relying upon uncontrolled\napproximation. It is also interesting to note that the ergodicity restoring process\nin our toy model (represented by the kernels \u03a3aa and \u03a3ab ) has nothing to do with\na thermally activated energy barrier crossing since the gaussian Hamiltonian in our\nmodel does not possess such a barrier.\nOur numerical solution for \u03b4 \u2217 = 0.3 is shown in Figure 1 with various values of\nT . The other parameters were fixed as \u03c9 = 1, \u03b3 = 1, and g = 1. As T is lowered, the\nrelaxation exhibits a continuous slowing and it appears to be frozen at lowest T . One\nmay ask whether this freezing reflects the presence of the genuine nonergodicity or it\nis merely apparent: the decaying will be observed if the observation time window is\nfurther extended. The question of the existence of nonergodicity is easily answered\nin the usual idealized MCT where one can easily solve the closed equation for the\nnonergodicity parameter to obtain the phase diagram. The situation is very different\n(0)\nin our toy model. When we expand the correlators as CaL (z) = fa /z + fa + f (1) z + * * *\netc., we end up with a herarchically connected set of equations for all the f 's, which\ncan not be easily analyzed numerically.\nAn analytic feature signifying the presence of the genuine nonergodic state can\nbe seen by adiabatically eliminating the velocity components in the limit of large\n\u03b3 and obtaining the Fokker-Planck equation for the distribution function D\u0303({a}, t)\n\n\f9\n\nKinetically driven glassy transition\ncontaining only the {a} variables:\n\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u03c92\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202 D\u0303({a}, t)\n(46)\nQij ({a})\n+\n=\naj D\u0303({a}, t)\n\u2202t\n\u2202ai\n\u2202aj\nT\nHere the diffusion matrix Qij ({a}) is given by\nT\nQij ({a}) \u2261 Mi\u03b1 Mj\u03b1\n\u03b3\n\u03c9\nMi\u03b1 \u2261 Ki\u03b1 + \u221a Jik\u03b1 ak\n(47)\nN\nAn important point is that the diffusion matrix Qij is singular for M < N , i.e.,\ndet|Q| = 0 [15]. The proof is simple. Define a N \u00d7 N matrix M by Mij \u2261\nMi,j=\u03b1 for j \u2264 M , Mij \u2261 0 for j > M . Then we obtain in matrix notation\nQ = (T /\u03b3)M * MT (The superscript T denotes the transposed matrix). Then\ndet|Q| = (T /\u03b3)N (det|M|)2 = 0 since det|M| = 0 by construction. This implies\nthat the Fokker-Planck equation (46) can have nonequilibrium stationary solution\nother than the equilibrium one, D\u0303e ({a}) = cst. exp(\u2212\u03c9 2 a2j /2T ). This nonequilibrium\nstationary solutions are precisely the kind of nonergodic states found numerically in\nthe present toy model. The general stationary solution [16] is given by\n\u03c92\n\n2\n\nD\u0303L ({a}) = F (\u03bej aj ) e\u2212 2T ai\n\n(48)\n\nwhere \u03bei is the eigenvector of the diffusion matrix Qij with zero eigenvalue. If the\nfunction F (x) is a constant, then D\u0303L ({a}) = D\u0303e ({a}) is the equilibrium distribution,\notherwise it is a nonequilibrium stationary distribution.\nOne instructive case for the nonequilibrium stationary solutions is that of\ng = 0. For this case, Qij becomes proportional to the dynamic matrix \u03a9ij :\nQij = (T /\u03b3)Ki\u03b1 Kj\u03b1 = (T /\u03b3\u03c9 2 )\u03a9ij . By the same argument as above \u03a9ij is singular\nas well. Note from (36) that CaL (z) = (T /\u03c9 2 ) * (1 \u2212 \u03b4 \u2217 )/z in the limit of z \u2192 0.\nThe other correlators do not diverge at z = 0. Hence the model is nonergodic for\n0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2217 < 1: the system is always driven into the nonergodic state in the linear case\n(g = 0). In this case the thermal noise alone is not enough to drive the system to\nthe equilibrium state. This case is somewhat reminiscent of the ideal gas case or the\ncollection of independent harmonic oscillators where the systems are trivially nonergodic due to the absence of interactions. Only when the nonlinear reversible mode\ncoupling is present, as T increases, the thermal noise can drive the system to the\nequilbrium state, hence making the system ergodic. The onset temperature at which\nthe ergodicity is recovered is the dynamic transition temperature.\nIn any event, further numerical and theoretical studies of possibile ergodic-tononergodic transitions for nontrivial case g 6= 0 are warranted.\n4. Summary\nWe have constructed a dynamic mean-field-type model involving N -component\ndensity and M -component velocity variables with reversible mode coupling and trivial\nHamiltonian. The model is exactly solvable in the limit of N, M \u2192 \u221e with keeping\nthe ratio \u03b4 \u2217 \u2261 M/N finite. The model exhibits a sharp dynamic transition to a\nnonergodic state only in the range 0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2217 < 1. The nature of the nonergodic state\ncan be understood in terms of the nonequilibrium stationary solution of the FokkerPlanck equation for the probability distribution for the density variable. It would be\ninteresting to investigate the nonequilibrium aging behavior of the model.\n\n\fKinetically driven glassy transition\n\n10\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank W. G\u00f6tze, J. J\u00e4ckle, A.
