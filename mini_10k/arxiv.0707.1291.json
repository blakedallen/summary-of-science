Our goal is to indicate new features that should be\nreproduced by the realistic dynamical models describing the hadron\nspectrum in the sector of light quarks.\n\nThe observation of more than thirty new inelastic p\u0304p resonances in the\nrecent analyses of Crystal Barrel and PS172 data [1\u20134] has been a spectacular\nevent in the spectroscopy of light hadrons below 2.4 GeV. It is well known\nthat the hadron mass spectrum contains an important information on properties of the strong interactions. In this regard the data obtained remarkably\nconfirmed various spectral regularities that indicate to a high degree of symmetry emerging in the large distance strong interactions [5\u201311]. And what\nis more the concept of Regge trajectories acquired a more solid experimental support. It is tempting to assume that instead of using the language of\nhadron resonances one could discuss some important phenomena in QCD,\nsay the chiral symmetry breaking, in the language of geometrical behavior of\nRegge trajectories. We will try to demonstrate how the latter language may\nbe used.\nThe purpose of this note is to bring attention to possible implications\nof the Crystal Barrel data for meson-baryon symmetries. We expect that\nthe joint consideration of meson and baryon sectors could be useful for both\nsectors of hadron spectroscopy.\nAs a starting point for our discussions we present Fig. 1 where the combined meson-baryon light non-strange spectrum is displayed on one plot. For\nthe details of meson plot we refer to [6], that plot is supplemented in Fig. 1\nwith the baryon states.\nA prominent feature of light non-strange meson spectrum is the wellpronounced clustering of states near equidistant values of masses square [6\u20139].\nThe corresponding baryon sector is known to reveal a tendency to clustering\n1\n\nOn leave of absence from V.

Our first observation is that the position of the third meson cluster\nhappens to coincide with the first more or less pronounced cluster of baryons.\nMost of states in both clusters are well established [12], thus this is a quite\nsecure effect. The resonances in the second baryon cluster (especially the\nwell established ones) are shifted towards lower energies with respect to the\nfourth meson cluster. It seems that there is no enough data to speak about\nthe next baryon cluster that would correspond to the fifth meson one.\nThese observations have important consequences for a possible dynamical supersymmetry that was suggested long ago [13]. Such a meson-baryon\nsymmetry is commonly motivated by the quark-diquark structure of baryons\nwhere the diquark might have approximately the same constituent mass as\nquark and behave like antiquark in mesons. In particular, in ref. [14, 15] it\nis suggested that the diquarks can become well defined objects in the highly\nexcited baryons due to large separation from the quark inside a baryon. The\nmasses of some mesons and baryons are indeed surprisingly close. Unfortunately, such coincidences prove nothing because one should analyze the\nfull amount of data. As seen in Fig. 1 near 1.7 GeV (the third meson cluster) some kind of meson-baryon supersymmetry can indeed take place. But\nthe resonances obtained by the Crystal Barrel Collaboration (they mainly\nconstitute the last two clusters in Fig. 1) do not confirm convincingly this\nsymmetry. Even if one assumes that there are different kinds of diquarks (the\nspin singlet and spin triplet ones) with different masses and the constituent\nmass of diquarks depend on the energy scale, any meson-baryon symmetry should dictate a certain correlation between the number of mesons and\nbaryons and this correlation should recur at higher energies. One indeed\nobserves some recurrences in both meson and baryon sectors - the cluster\nstructure of spectrum - but looking at the third and fourth meson clusters\nand their baryonic counterparts it is hard to see any clear-cut correlation in\nthe number of states. It is not excluded of course that the reason is just a\nlack of data in the baryon sector.\nIn what follows we will indicate some new features of meson-baryon spectra that likely should be reproduced in any viable dynamical models describing the spectrum of light non-strange hadrons.\nThe recurrence patterns in meson spectrum seems to suggest that the\nMacDowell symmetry is (partly) realized in the meson sector. We will remind\nbriefly the essence of this symmetry. Consider a Regge trajectory \u03b1(s). According to Regge-pole theory [16], in general there will be a series of daughter\ntrajectories \u03b1k (s) in the angular momentum plane, of alternating signature,\nsatisfying\n\u03b1k (s) = \u03b10 (s) \u2212 k,\nk = 1, 2, . . . .\n(1)\n\n2\n\n\fThe MacDowell symmetry says that all baryon trajectories with equal isospin,\nthe same signature, and opposite parity are degenerate. This property was\nindeed observed in the late 1960s [17, 18].\nThe meson spectrum also reveals the parity doubling and the Crystal\nBarrel data remarkably confirmed this phenomenon (see [11] for a review).\nA feature of meson trajectories is that the exchange degeneracy, resulting\nfrom the absence of I = 2 mesons [16], leads to the approximate coincidence\nof trajectories formed by \u03c1, \u03c9, f2 , and a2 resonances. As a result, the \u03c1 (\u03c9)\ntrajectory with J = 1, 3, 5, . . . and a2 (f2 ) trajectory of opposite signature\nwith J = 2, 4, 6, . . . coalesce into one master trajectory (we recall that a\nreggeized pole amplitude of negative signature has poles at odd J and that\nof positive signature does at even J). The equidistant sequence of daughters\ngives rise to linear \"radial\" trajectories - the towers of states with the\nsame quantum numbers, the \"radial\" excitations in the language of potential\nmodels. For instance, the J = 1 states on the daughters of master trajectory\nhave the quantum numbers of the \u03c1 (\u03c9) meson. In addition, the Adler selfconsistency condition in dual models requires the master trajectory to have\nthe intercept \u03b10 (m2\u03c0 ) = 12 and, hence, the slope \u03b1\u2032 = (2m2\u03c1 \u2212 2m2\u03c0 )\u22121 [16].\nThe results of Regge-pole theory are general consequences of unitarity and\nanalyticity. The role of QCD is to provide the linearity of trajectories and the\nscale \u03b1\u2032 . The corresponding trajectories are displayed in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.\nThe MacDowell trajectory pairs have to be joined at the point M 2 = 0,\nfor convenience in representation the remaining trajectories are joined in a\nlinear manner (like the baryon trajectories in ref. [17, 18]). We assign the\nexperimental light unflavored states to the drawn trajectories according to\ntheir averaged masses and quantum numbers. The Crystal Barrel experiment\nrevealed many new resonances in the energy interval 1.9 - 2.4 GeV, they\noccupy the vacant places in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 with surprisingly high accuracy.\nIn addition, in all cases when they do not coincide with the known states\nfrom the Particle Data Group (PDG) [12], the agreement with the theoretical\nexpectations is improved. As a result one observes that all meson trajectories\nare approximately MacDowell symmetric except the leading master trajectory.\nThe first daughter of master trajectory and its MacDowell symmetric trajectory, the leading pseudoscalar one, show up an intriguing pattern of deviations from exact linearity for the low lying states (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). Presumably the deviations are caused by the chiral symmetry breaking (CSB) at\nlow energies. It can be shown that the masses square of shifted states behave\napproximately as if the total length of joined trajectory remained unchanged\nafter deviations, i.e. the joined trajectories are approximately \"rigid\" with\nrespect to the strong interaction dynamics. In Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 we have\nconfined ourselves by the linear form of deviations, but the conclusion holds\n3\n\n\fbeyond this simplification. The observed correlations imply, in particular,\nthat there may be a hidden relation between CSB and the violation of OZIrule for scalar mesons (i.e. a considerable mixture of strange and non-strange\ncomponents).\nIn Fig. 4, we display the spectrum of leading nucleon and delta trajectories and their daughters. The slopes of baryon and meson trajectories are\nknown to coincide, for comparison we present in Fig. 4 the leading \u03c1-meson\ntrajectory from Fig. 2. In addition, the leading nucleon and delta trajectories\nseem to coalesce into one baryon master trajectory. Similarly to the mesons,\nthe leading delta trajectory does not possess the MacDowell symmetric pair,\nbut this is not the case for the leading nucleon trajectory.\nIf an approximate symmetry between the meson and baryon spectra takes\nplace it can provide new inside into the phenomenon of CSB. The deviations\nof trajectories from linearity at low energies are believed to be caused mainly\nby CSB in QCD. What happens to the spectrum of unflavored hadrons if\nwe could somehow restore the chiral symmetry, maintaining the other features of confining QCD? One can naturally expect that the meson master\ntrajectory remains almost unaffected as long as the mass of \u03c1-meson originates, most probably, from the QCD mass gap. On the other hand, in the\ncase of exact meson-baryon supersymmetry, the leading baryon trajectories\nshould coincide with the meson master trajectory (as seen from Fig. 4 in\nreality there is a constant shift between these trajectories, this fact is interesting by itself and is not yet understood). Since the intercept of the meson\nmaster trajectory is approximately 12 , the ground nucleon becomes massless\nin the chirally symmetric world. The fact that the mass of ground nucleon\nis mostly generated by CSB in QCD, has been known for long ago [19, 20],\nwe just emphasize its relation with a possible meson-baryon symmetry. In\naddition, assuming a similar pattern of deviation from linearity as in the\nmeson sector, one can immediately see from Fig. 4 why the ground nucleon\nstate does not have a parity partner - the latter becomes tachyon after CSB\nand disappears from the physical spectrum. A dynamical description of this\nmechanism is a challenge for models describing CSB and hadron spectrum.\nAnother novel indication on the possible existence of meson-baryon symmetry could be the fact that the light non-strange spectrum of both mesons\nand baryons is, in a group-theoretical sense, similar to the spectrum of the\nhydrogen atom, but this is a subject of a separate paper [21].\nConcluding this note, we hope that a new way of representation of data on\nlight non-strange hadrons proposed here and ensuing new features of spectra\nwill rise interest to the related problems both from the theoretical and from\nthe experimental side.\nThe work was supported by the Ministry of Education of Russian Feder4\n\n\fation, grant RNP.2.1.1.1112, by the Government of Sankt-Petersburg, grant\n29-04/23, and by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.

Experimental errors are indicated except the\none- and two-star baryons (by thin strips for \u2206). Circles stay when errors\nare negligible. For mesons the dashed lines mark the mean (mass)2 in each\ncluster of states (these lines are continued to the baryon sector) and the open\nstrips denote the one-star states from ref. [3] or the states that are dubious\nas non-strange mesons. The symbols \u0007 and \u2666 denote the two- and one-star\nnucleons correspondingly. The symbols H and \u25bd do the same for \u2206-baryons.\n\n7\n\n\fJP JP\naJ\n\u03c0J\n2250\n\n2275\n\n2031\n\n2330\n2001\n\n2005\n\n2270\n\n1672\n\n1930\n\n2070\n\n5\n\n\u2190 (MASS)\n\n4\n\n1689\n\n3+ 3\u2212\n\n1647\n\n1812\n\n3\n\n1318\n\n2\u2212 2+\n\n2090\n\n6\n\n2300\n\n4\u2212 4+\n\n2245\n\n2360\n\n\u03c1J\naJ\n\n5+ 5\u2212\n\n1230\n\n1300\n\n2\n\n776\n\n1459\n\n1+ 1\u2212\n140\n\n1 0\n\n\u2212\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1720\n\n1982\n\n1\n\n1474\n\n2\n\n2250\n2300\n\n2030\n\n2000\n1900\n\n985\n+\n\n1732\n\n2255\n\n2255\n\n2265\n2149\n\n2025\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n2\n\n(MASS) \u2192\n\nI=1\n\nI=1\n\nFigure 2: The trajectories of isovector non-strange mesons (in GeV2 ).

The experimental errors are indicated (for some states the Particle\nData does not provide errors, in these cases we plot the whole range of masses\nreported for a given state, the ensuing errors are typically quite large). The\nleading \u03c1-meson trajectory from Fig. 2 is drawn for comparison. The dashed\nline is the MacDowell symmetric pair for the leading baryon trajectory. The\ndotted line shows a possible pattern of deviation from linearity at low energies\nfor the leading nucleon trajectories.\n\n10\n\n\f"}
