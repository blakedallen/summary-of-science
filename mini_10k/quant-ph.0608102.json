In recent times a good number of articles have been published\n[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] in this field. The\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation with position-dependent mass has\nbeen studied in the contexts of supersymmetry, shapeinvariance, Lie algebra, point-canonical transformation,\netc. It is well known that the kinetic energy operator in\nthis case belongs to the two-parameter family [5]\nT (x) =\n\n1 \u03b1\n(m p m\u03b2 p m\u03b3 + m\u03b3 p m\u03b2 p m\u03b1 ),\n4\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere m = m(x) and p = \u2212i~ d/dx, with the constraint\n\u03b1 + \u03b2 + \u03b3 = \u22121.\n\n(1.2)\n\nHowever, the correct values of the parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 for\na specific model is a long-standing debate [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].\nFor example, in the case of a potential step and barrier\n[8], and in some one-dimensional potential wells [9] with\nvarying mass, the following kinetic energy operator was\nchosen\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\np p ,\nT (x) =\n(1.3)\n2\nm\nwhich corresponds to \u03b1 = \u03b3 = 0, \u03b2 = \u22121. Then, it was\nshown that the reflection and transmission coefficients\n[8], as well as the discrete spectrum [9], are different compared to the constant-mass problem.\nIn this article we are going to study the following physical problem: the potential energy has the form of a well,\n\n\u2217 On\n\nleave of absence from City College (C.C.C.B.A), University of\nCalcutta, 13 Surya Sen Street, Kolkata\u2013700012, India. gangulyasish@rediffmail.com\n\u2020 On leave of absence from Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Ankara University 06100 Ankara, Turkey.\nkuru@science.ankara.edu.tr\n\u2021 jnegro@fta.uva.es\n\u00a7 luismi@metodos.fam.cie.uva.es\n\nboth in symmetric as well as asymmetric form, and the\nkinetic energy is given by (1.1) with a mass function m(x)\nwhich has different constant values inside and outside the\nwell. This problem has also interest from the point of\nview of applications in carbon nanotubes and quantum\ndots, as can be seen in [20, 21]. Our purpose is first to\nfind an ordering of the kinetic energy term appropriate to\nthis problem, and then, to study in full detail the bound\nstates of this model and to compare the results with the\nconventional constant-mass case.\nSeveral problems which resemble our model have been\nconsidered previously in the literature. For example, the\nscattering states of a potential step or barrier were studied in [8, 22]. Other special square well potentials were\nanalysed in [23], and the bound states for some finite\nand infinite wells were studied using other kinetic energy operator and matching conditions in [9]. However,\nour approach is different from the very beginning because we propose an ordering for kinetic term based on\na specific argument for the matching conditions. This\nordering is also used in [24] for studying connection rules\nfor effective-mass wave functions across an abrupt heterojunction.\nThe structure of this article is as follows. Sec. II is\ndevoted to fix the ordering in the kinetic term. In Sec. III\na transcendental equation determining the energy values\nfor the bound states in the case of a potential energy well\nis derived. The numerical results are shown graphically\nand discussed in Sec. IV. Finally, Section V contains the\nconclusions of our work.\n\nII. MATCHING CONDITIONS AT THE\nDISCONTINUITIES OF THE MASS AND\nPOTENTIAL FUNCTION\n\nThe Hamiltonian operator for the position-dependent\nmass problem is given by\nH = T (x) + V (x)\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere T (x) is the operator defined in (1.1) and V (x)\ndenotes the potential term. The one-dimensional timeindependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the stationary\n\n\f2\nand Eq. (2.6) takes the following simple form\n\nstates is\nH \u03c8(x) = E \u03c8(x).\n\n(2.2)\n\nSubstituting (1.1) and (2.1) into (2.2) and taking units\nsuch that ~2 = 2, we get the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for\nthe generalized kinetic energy operator\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012\nd2 \u03c8 m\u2032 d\u03c8\nm\u2032\u2032\nm\u20322\n1\n\u03bd\n+\nm(E\n\u2212\nV\n)\n\u03c8=0\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n\u03b7\ndx2\nm dx\n2\nm\nm2\n(2.3)\nwhere\n\u03b7 = \u03b1(\u03b3 + 2) \u2212 \u03b3(\u03b1 + 2),\n\n\u03bd = \u03b1 + \u03b3,\n\n(2.4)\n\nand m\u2032 = dm/dx. If in Eq. (2.3) we make the following\ntransformation\n\u03c8(x) = m(x)1/2 \u03c6(x)\n\n(2.5)\n\nwe can eliminate the first order derivative of \u03c8 with respect to x, to arrive at\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0012\nm\u2032\u2032\n3 \u03b7 m\u2032 2\nd2 \u03c6\n+ (1 + \u03bd)\n+ m (E \u2212 V ) \u03c6 = 0.\n\u2212\n+\ndx2\n2m\n4 2 m2\n(2.6)\nOur aim is to generalize the usual matching conditions for the wave function \u03c8(x) suitable for this positiondependent mass problem. We will focus on the case of\nmass discontinuities.\nA.\n\nMatching conditions\n\nNow, let us assume that the mass m(x) has a finite\ndiscontinuity at x = a of the form\nm(x) = m1 (x)\u0398(\u2212x + a) + m2 (x)\u0398(x \u2212 a)\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere m1 (x) and m2 (x) are smooth functions and the\nunit step function \u0398(x) is defined as\n\u001a\n1, x > 0\n(2.8)\n\u0398(x) =\n0, x < 0.\nIf we use (2.7) in Eq. (2.6), we see that it leads to strong\ndiscontinuities at x = a as well as some terms that require a careful interpretation. For instance, we should\ntake into account that \u0398\u2032 (x) \u2261 d\u0398(x)/dx = \u03b4(x), where\n\u03b4(x) denotes the Dirac delta distribution. In order to\neliminate these problems in Eq. (2.6), we can choose\n1 + \u03bd = 0,\n\n3 \u03b7\n+ = 0,\n4 2\n\n\u2212\n\nd2 \u03c6\n+ m (V \u2212 E)\u03c6 = 0.\ndx2\n\n(2.11)\n\nNow, it is easy to get the matching conditions for \u03c8 at\nx = a. To do this, first we integrate Eq. (2.11) around\nthe discontinuity point x = a\n\u03c6\u2032 (a + h) \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 (a \u2212 h) =\n\nZ\n\na+h\n\na\u2212h\n\nm(x) (V (x) \u2212 E)\u03c6(x) dx.\n\n(2.12)\nIn the interval (a\u2212h, a+h), the functions m(x) and V (x)\nhave finite discontinuities at x = a and \u03c6(x) is bounded.\nTherefore, when h goes to zero, the integral at the r.h.s.\nof (2.12) tends to zero. This means that \u03c6\u2032 (x) (and also\n\u03c6(x)) will be continuous at x = a. In conclusion, using\nthe transformation (2.5) we have arrived at the following\nmatching conditions: thepwave function \u03c8(x)pis such that\nthe two functions \u03c8(x)/ m(x) and (\u03c8(x)/ m(x))\u2032 are\ncontinuous at x = a. Mathematically it may be expressed\nas\n\u03c8(x)\np\nm(x)\n\u03c8(x)\np\nm(x)\n\n!\u2032\n\nx=a\u22120\n\n=\nx=a\u22120\n\n\u03c8(x)\n= p\nm(x)\n\u03c8(x)\np\nm(x)\n\n!\u2032\n\nx=a+0\n\n\u03c8(a)\n,\n= p\nm(a)\n\n=\nx=a+0\n\n\u03c8(x)\np\nm(x)\n\n!\u2032\n\n,\nx=a\n\n(2.13)\nwhere a is an interior point in the domain of the problem.\nIt is straightforward to check that the above conditions\nare consistent with the definition of a time-independent\ninner product in the space\nof square integrable eigenfuncR\ntions h\u03c8(x), \u03c6(x)i = \u03c8(x)\u2217 \u03c6(x) dx, as well as with the\nconservation of the current density\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 d\u03c8(x) d\u03c8(x)\u2217 1\nj(x) = \u2212i \u03c8(x)\u2217\n\u2212\n\u03c8(x) .\nm(x) dx\ndx m(x)\n(2.14)\nIt is clear that these matching conditions are consistent\nwith the Hermitian character of the Hamiltonian (2.1)\nwith (1.1). We should stress that the above mentioned\nboundary conditions indeed define a self-adjoint problem\n(this issue will be addressed in detail elsewhere [25]).\n\nIII.\n\nA SQUARE POTENTIAL WELL AND A\nSTEP MASS\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere \u03b7 and \u03bd were given in (2.4). From these conditions,\nwe obtain the values of the parameters \u03b1 = \u03b3 = \u2212 21 and\n\u03b2 = 0.

Next, we will study\nthe bound states (0 < E < V1 \u2264 V2 ) for this problem\nusing to the matching condition obtained in the previous\nsection.\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation (2.3) for the wavefunction\n\u03c8(x) has the following form in each region\np\nd2 \u03c8\n\u2212 k12 \u03c8 = 0, k1 = m1 (V1 \u2212 E), x < \u2212a, (3.3)\n2\ndx\n\u221a\nd2 \u03c8\n+ k22 \u03c8 = 0, k2 = m2 E,\n|x| < a, (3.4)\n2\ndx\np\nd2 \u03c8\n\u2212 k32 \u03c8 = 0, k3 = m1 (V2 \u2212 E), x > a. (3.5)\n2\ndx\nThe physical solutions of these equations take the form\n\uf8f1\nk x\nx < \u2212a\n\uf8f2 Ae 1 ,\n(3.6)\n\u03c8(x) = C sin(k2 x + \u03b8), |x| < a\n\uf8f3\nB e\u2212k3 x ,\nx>a\nwhere A, B, C, and \u03b8 are constants to be determined by\nthe boundary and matching conditions. Using the continuity conditions (2.13) for this solution at x = \u2212a, we\nobtain the following two equations\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\nm2\nA\ne\u2212k1 a = C sin(\u2212k2 a + \u03b8)\n(3.7)\nm1\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\nm2\nA\nk1 e\u2212k1 a = Ck2 cos(\u2212k2 a + \u03b8) (3.8)\nm1\n\nand at x = a, we get\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\nm2\nB\ne\u2212k3 a = C sin(k2 a + \u03b8)\n(3.9)\nm1\n\u00131/2\n\u0012\nm2\nB\nk3 e\u2212k3 a = Ck2 cos(k2 a + \u03b8). (3.10)\nm1\n\nFrom these four equations, we find\nk1 = k2 cot(\u2212k2 a + \u03b8),\nor\n\nk3 = \u2212k2 cot(k2 a + \u03b8) (3.11)\n\nk2\nsin(\u2212k2 a + \u03b8) = q\n1\nm1 V1 \u2212 k22 ( m\nm2 \u2212 1)\n\n(3.12)\n\nk2\nsin(k2 a + \u03b8) = \u2212 q\n. (3.13)\n1\nm1 V2 \u2212 k22 ( m\nm2 \u2212 1)\n\nNow, if we eliminate \u03b8 from (3.12) and (3.13), we get the\ntranscendental equation\nk2\n2k2 a = n\u03c0 \u2212 sin\u22121 q\n1\nm1 V2 \u2212 k22 ( m\nm2 \u2212 1)\nk2\n\u2212 sin\u22121 q\n,\n1\nm1 V1 \u2212 k22 ( m\nm2 \u2212 1)\n\n(3.14)\n\nwhere inside the well, the momentum k2 of the bound\nstates is obtained from the values n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , and\nthe range of the inverse sine is taken between 0 and \u03c02 .\nSince E = (k2 )2 /m2 , the roots of this equation also give\nthe energy values of the bound states.\n\u221a\nAs the maximum value that k2 could take is m2 V1 ,\nfrom Eq. (3.14), we get an inequality for the number of\nbound states\n\u221a\n\u0013\n\u0012\np\nm2 V1\n1\n\u03c0 \u2212 sin\u22121 \u221a\n,\n2a m2 V1 > n \u2212\n2\nm2 V1 + m1 \u2206V\n(3.15)\nwith \u2206V = V2 \u2212 V1 \u2265 0. This means that the total\nnumber of bound states N will be the highest n satisfying\nthis inequality. When we consider (3.15) as an equation\nfor N = 1, 2, . . . ,\n\u221a\n\u0012\n\u0013\np\n1\nm2 V1\n2a m2 V1 = N \u2212\n\u03c0 \u2212 sin\u22121 \u221a\n2\nm2 V1 + m1 \u2206V\n(3.16)\nwe say that the parameters of the well are\"critical\", in\nthe sense that by modifying slightly their values we will\nhave one bound state less or one bound state more.\nFrom (3.16), for N = 1 we see that the first bound\nstate of the asymmetric square well will appear when the\nfollowing condition is satisfied:\n\u221a\np\n\u03c0\nm2 V1\nsin\u22121 \u221a\n= \u2212 2a m2 V1 .\n(3.17)\n2\nm2 V1 + m1 \u2206V\nTherefore, we can say that for V1 6= V2 , there are always some values of the parameters of the well that do\nnot allow for bound states, as it is also the case for the\nconventional constant-mass problem.\nThe influence of m1 (the mass outside the well) on the\nnumber of bound states is not so important. Let us call\nf (m1 ) the function on the l.h.s. of (3.17), then\nlim f (m1 ) \u2212 lim f (m1 ) =\n\nm1 \u21920\n\nm1 \u2192\u221e\n\n\u03c0\n.\n2\n\n(3.18)\n\nThis means that as we increase m1 the spectrum of bound\nstates either will remain the same or will have one value\nless. This is in sharp contradistinction to the influence of\nm2 , that can change any number of levels in the discrete\nspectrum.\nThe conventional constant-mass case is obtained by\ntaking m1 = m2 = m in Eq. (3.14) to get the well\nknown formula [26]\nk2\nk2\n\u2212 sin\u22121 \u221a\n,\n2k2 a = n\u03c0 \u2212 sin\u22121 \u221a\nmV2\nmV1\n\n(3.19)\n\nwhere n = 1, 2, 3, . . . The inequality for the number of\nbound states is obtained now from (3.15) if we put m1 =\nm2 = m:\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\np\n1\nV1\n\u22121\n2a m V1 > n \u2212\n\u03c0 \u2212 sin\n.\n(3.20)\n2\nV2\n\n\f4\nHowever, we must stress that in the position-dependent\nmass case the critical values given by formula (3.15) for\nthe number of bound states depend on both m1 and m2 ,\nin particular, as m2 \u2192 0, we see from (3.17) that no\nbound states will remain in the well.\nSymmetric well\n\nIf V1 = V2 = V , from (3.11), we get the energy equations corresponding to even and odd eigenfunctions by\nreplacing \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 and \u03b8 = 0, respectively\nk1\n= tan k2 a,\nk2\n\nk2\n= \u2212 tan k2 a.\nk1\n\nIn this section we will discuss some numerical results\nand graphics obtained from the formulas of the previous\nsections, paying attention to the consequences of mass\nvariation.\nConsider the situation of a particle of mass m1 in a\nsquare well potential, where we have altered the conditions inside the well to produce a different effective mass\nm2 . We want to study the effects that this change of\nmass will produce on the bound states.\n\n(3.21)\n\nIn this case, we can also write for both even and \u221a\nodd solutions the transcendental Eq. (3.14), using k2 = m2 E,\nin the following way\nk2\n,\n2k2 a = n\u03c0 \u2212 2 sin\u22121 p 2\nk2 + m1 (V \u2212 E)\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\n(3.22)\n\nwhere n = 1, 2, 3, . . . Here, the argument of the inverse\nsine is always less than 1 for V \u2212 E > 0, and therefore\nthe formula is well defined. If we make E = V in (3.22)\nthe number of bound states N is given by the highest n\nsatisfying the inequality\np\n2a m2 V > (n \u2212 1)\u03c0.\n(3.23)\n\nThis means that there are always bound states for the\nsymmetric well. Even more, once the depth V and the\nwidth 2a of the well are fixed, the number of bound states\ndoes not depend on m1 , it depends only on the mass inside of the well (m2 ). The relation (3.23) for the number\nof bound states coincides with that obtained also by Plastino et al using different matching conditions. However,\nthe energy equations (3.21)\u2013(3.22) are different from [9].\nIn fact, when the inside mass is bigger (smaller) than the\noutside mass, then our energy spectrum is lower (upper)\nthan the spectrum given in [9].\nThe critical values of the well (which determine when\nwe have one bound state more) are obtained from\np\n2a m2 V = (N \u2212 1)\u03c0.\n(3.24)\n\nA.\n\nFeatures of the asymmetric well\n\nThe main characteristics of the asymmetric well may\nbe summarized as follows:\n1. If V1 < V2 , it can be seen from formula (3.15) that\nthe number of bound states depends linearly on the\nwidth 2a of the asymmetric well as shown in Fig. 1,\n\n1\n0.8\nEHaL\n\nB.\n\nIV.\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n1\n\n2\n\n3\na\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFIG. 1: Plot of the energy values and the number of the bound\nstates depending on the width of the well 2a when the other\nparameters are fixed as: V1 = 1, V2 = 2, m1 = 1, m2 = 2\n(solid lines), m2 = 1 (dotted lines), and m2 = 0.5 (dashed\nlines).\n\nwhere we have plotted three situations:\n(a) the usual constant-mass case, m1 = m2 = 1,\n\nThus the critical values of a are linear in the number\nN \u2212 1 of bound states, while the critical values m2 grow\nas the square of (N \u2212 1). In conclusion, the important\nparameter here is the mass m2 inside the well, while the\nmass outside (m1 ) plays a secondary role.\nThe number of bound states for the conventional\nconstant-mass symmetric well are given also by (3.23)\nreplacing m2 \u2192 m. However, the energy of these bound\nstates is defined through (3.22) by choosing m1 = m2 =\nm\nk2\n\u03c0\n.\n(3.25)\nk2 a = n \u2212 sin\u22121 \u221a\n2\nmV\n\nThus, the effect of m2 on the bound states is quite\nstrong for any value of a, as can be seen in Fig. 1.\nWhen m2 is decreasing, the number of bound states\nalso decrease, while each energy level is higher. In\nTable I it is shown the effect of these three values\nof m2 on the first critical values of the width 2a.\n\nHence the values of the energies will be different from the\nposition-dependent mass.\n\n2. In Fig. 2 we plotted the bound state energies as we\nchange only the inside mass m2 for m1 = 1 and\n\n(b) m1 = 1, m2 = 2, that is the case where the\nmass inside is bigger than outside the well,\n(c) m1 = 1, m2 = 0.5, that corresponds to a\nlighter mass inside the well.\n\n\f5\nTABLE I: The critical values of a obtained from Eq.

We\nsee that the number of bound states is almost proportional to the square root of m2 due to (3.15),\nwhile the energy value of each bound state decreases with m2 . The influence of V1 is similar as\nthat of m2 .\n3. In the same figure, we can see that the influence of\nm1 (the mass outside the well) on the number of\nbound states is not so important.

(3.24).\n\nvalues of m2 are the same, independently of the\nvalues of m1 .\n3. The energy values given by (3.22) are only slightly\naffected by the variation of m1 , the mass outside\nthe well. This is shown in Fig. 3, for the values\nm1 = 1, m1 = 10 and m1 = m2 = m. A detail of\nthis plot is shown in Fig. 4, where the energy levels\nof the case m1 = 1 coincide with the conventional\nconstant-mass case (m1 = m2 = m) at the point\nm2 = 1. Clearly, the energy levels of the case m1 =\n10 will also coincide with those for constant-mass\ncase m1 = m2 = m at the point m2 = 10 (see\nFig. 3).\n\nFeatures of the symmetric well\n\nIn the symmetric well the importance of the mass m2\ninside the well is even stronger than in the asymmetric\nwell. The main characteristics of the symmetric well are\nthe following:\n1. The number of bound states depends linearly on a,\nthe square root of the m2 and V , as in the asymmetric well, but it is independent of m1 .\n2. The dependence on m2 is shown in Fig. 3, a detail\nis given in Fig. 4. As a consequence, the critical\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this article we have studied a potential well both\nin symmetric and asymmetric form, with different constant mass inside and outside the well. We have proposed\nspecific values for the ordering parameters in the kinetic\nterm based on the simple argument that strong singularities in the effective-mass Schr\u00f6dinger equation should be\navoided. However, this choice is not unique: for instance,\nthe symmetric well has been considered in [9] with a kinetic term proposed in [8].
