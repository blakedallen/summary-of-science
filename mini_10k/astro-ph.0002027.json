Overmerging is the\ndisruption of subhaloes within embedding haloes due to numerical problems connected\nwith the discreteness of N-body dynamics. It is shown that the process responsible for\novermerging is particle-subhalo two-body heating. Various solutions to the overmerging problem are discussed.\nKey words: galaxies: evolution - dark matter - large-scale structure of Universe\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn the study of the formation and evolution of large-scale\nstructure in the universe, clusters of galaxies, galaxies, and\nmany other gravitational systems, haloes play an important\nr\u00f4le. A halo is defined as a collapsed and virialized density maximum. A halo can contain several smaller haloes,\ndenoted as subhaloes. We denote a halo that contains subhaloes as an embedding halo. The existence of subhaloes\nis an important issue in cosmology, especially for galaxies,\nand groups and clusters of galaxies. For example, hierarchical structure formation scenarios for CDM-like spectra\npredict many more dwarf galaxies (or satellites) than observed (Klypin et al. 1999b, Moore et al. 1999). Also, a spiral\ngalaxy cannot retain its disk if there is an high abundance\nof subhaloes within its halo (Moore et al. 1999). Thus, the\nquestion is whether the initial density fluctuation spetrum is\nsuch that not many dwarf galaxies form in the first place, or\nthat they are easily destroyed within our Galaxy, and hard\nto find outside it. On larger scale, clusters of galaxies do\ncontain an abundance of subhaloes, i.e. its member galaxies, which are often distorted and stripped, but probably not\ndestroyed.\nN-body simulations are routinely used to model the formation, evolution, and clustering of galaxy and galaxy cluster haloes. However, the N-body simulation method does\nhave its limitiations, and care should be taken with the interpretation of the simulation results. One such limitation\narises from the use of particles to represent the mass distribution whose evolution one tries to simulate. If the physical mass distribution is effectively collisionless, as is often\nthe case, the use of particles gives rise to artificial collisional effects within the numerical mass distribution, especially though two-body interaction. Two-body encounters\nbetween simulation particles, either close or distant, deflect\ntheir orbits significantly, while they should behave like test\nparticles, and respond only to the mean potential. This is especially a problem for subhaloes, which are easily destroyed\nc 2000 RAS\n\nin an N-body simulation with insufficient resolution (White\net al. 1987; Carlberg 1994; van Kampen 1995). We use the\nterm overmerging for the numerical processes that artificially merge haloes and subhaloes in an N-body model, usually by disrupting the subhalo. Thus, the term merging only\ndenotes merging due to physical processes.\nHowever, there seems to be some confusion in the literature over the nature, cause, and importance of the overmerging problem. This paper attempts to clarify the difference between the three most important two-body processes\noperating on subhaloes, and provide estimates for their associated timescales. The first process is two-body evaporation, which is an internal process operation within any halo\nor subhalo. It is due to two-body interactions between the\nparticles within the halo or subhalo. The second process is\nparticle-subhalo two-body heating, which is the heating of\n'cold' subhaloes by particles from the 'hot' embedding halo\nthrough two-body interactions. The third process is particlesubhalo tidal heating, where the subhalo is considered collisionless, and increases its kinetic energy through tidal interactions with particles from the embedding halo. All three\nprocess are illustrated in Fig. 1.\nBesides the two-body processes, the use of softened particles, in order to minimize two-body effects, can cause overmerging as well by artificially enhancing physical processes\nlike merging and disruption by tidal forces (van Kampen\n1995; Moore et al. 1996). Groups of softened particles are\nnot as compact as real haloes, and their artificially larger\nsizes make N-body groups more prone to tidal disruption.\nCarlberg (1994) proposed particle-subhalo two-body\nheating as the main cause for overmerging. He gave a\ntimescale for this process, but no derivation. This was provided by van Kampen (1995). It has been shown before\n(Carlberg 1994; van Kampen 1995) that the two-body heating time-scale for small subhaloes orbiting an embedding\nhalo is short enough to result in their complete destruction\nand dispersion. Subsequent authors, including Moore et al.\n(1996) and Klypin et al. (1999a), referenced Carlberg (1994)\n\n\f2\n\nE. van Kampen\ntwo-body evaporation\n\nparticle-subhalo two-body heating\n\nembedding halo\n\nparticle-subhalo tidal heating\nFigure 1.

Moore et al. (1996) then claim that the process is\nnot important for the resolution of the simulation performed\nby Carlberg (1994) because the timescale is too long. However, the process Moore et al. (1996) actually describes and\nderives a timescale for is a different one, driven by tidal\nencounters between simulation particles and perfectly collisionless subhaloes, while Carlberg (1994) and van Kampen\n(1995) clearly had a collisonal process in mind, driven by\ntwo-body encounters between individual subhalo particles\nand particles from the embedding halo. This paper shows\nthat the latter process has a much shorter timescale, and\ntherefore, along with excessive softening, is the main cause\nfor overmerging.\n\n2 TWO-BODY EFFECTS IN N-BODY\nSIMULATIONS\nTwo-body effects become dominant for systems modelled by\nsmall numbers of particles. This is usually quantified by the\ntwo-body relaxation timescale, which is defined as the time\nit takes, on average, for a particle to change its velocity by\nof order itself. After this time a system is denoted as relaxed.\nThe relaxation timescale is defined in terms of the half-mass\nradius r, the typical velocity v (usually taken to be equal\nto the velocity dispersion), and the average change \u2206v per\ncrossing time r/v:\ntrelax \u2261\n\nv2 r\n.\n(\u2206v)2 v\n\n(1)\n\nFor an isolated virialized system of N point particles, it is\neasy to show that this is of order 0.1N/ ln N crossing times\n(eg. Binney & Tremaine 1987). If the time interval one tries\nto cover for a particular problem is larger than the twobody relaxtion timescale, the problem becomes artificially\ncollisional.\nAlthough many systems are likely to endure physical\nmechanisms like violent relaxation and phase mixing during some stage of their evolution, an obvious worry is that\n\nsuch physical mechanisms might not actually be important\nin a given situation, so that two-body interactions are very\nmuch unwanted as they might mimic the effects of physical mechanisms. A different problem is that a system might\ncompletely evaporate through two-body interactions.\nThe problem can be alleviated somewhat by softening the particles, which reduces the two-body relaxation\ntimescale to 0.1N/ ln \u039b crossing times (see van Kampen\n(1995) and references theirein), where \u039b = Min(R/4\u01eb, N ),\nwith R the effective size of the system, which we take to be\ntwice the half-mass radius r, and \u01eb the softening length of the\nN-body particles. However, \u01eb is necessarily a function of both\nN and r, as softened particles should not overlap too much.\nToo large a choice for \u01eb will prevent particles from clustering properly and produce haloes which are too extended\nand too cold (that is, the velocity dispersion is too small).\nGiven that N/2 particles reside within r by definition, the\nmean particle number density within r is 3N/(8\u03c0r 3 ). The\nmaximum mean particle density desirable is set by the minimum mean nearest neighbour distance for the particles:\n3\nnmax = 3/(4\u03c0rnn\n). Most often used is Plummer softening,\nwhich just means that particles have a Plummer density\nprofile, \u03c1(r) \u223c (r 2 + \u01eb2 )5/2 . The effective force resolution,\ndefined as the separation between two particles for which\nthe radial component of the softened force between them is\nhalf its Newtonian value, is \u2248 2.6\u01eb for Plummer softening\n(Gelb & Bertschinger 1994), so we want rnn >\n\u223c 2.6\u01eb, which\ngives nmax \u2248 0.014/\u01eb3 . Thus, we find a maximum realistic\nsoftening length\nr\n\u01eb\u2248\n(2)\n1 .\n2N 3\nFor this \u01eb the relaxation time becomes 0.3N/ ln N crossing\ntimes, i.e. three times larger than for the point particles case.\nEven though softening alleviates the problem of twobody effects somewhat, softened particle groups are more\nextended and less strongly bound (van Kampen 1995). This\nmakes them more vulnerable to two-body disruption processes, which are more efficient for larger subhaloes, as\nshown below. Furthermore, the timescales for physical disruption processes are effected. Subhalo-subhalo tidal heating\nhas a timescale inversely proportional to the subhalo size\n(van Kampen 2000), and is therefore slower, although the\nlower binding energy might compensate for this. Tidal stripping and disruption will be artificially enhanced, however,\nbecause of the larger subhalo size and the weaker binding of\nthe particles inside the group (van Kampen 1995). Because\nthe enhanced tidal disruption due to softening has the same\nnet effect as two-body disruption, which is also enhanced\ndue to the larger subhalo size, the two disruption processes\naccelerate each other. In the next section we derive two-body\ndisruption timescales without taking into account tidal disruption, and then treat these timescales as upper limits.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nDISRUPTION TIMESCALES\nTwo-body evaporation\n\nThis process is internal to haloes and subhaloes in other\nwords, it is a self-disruption process. Two-body interactions\nbetween particles within the same (sub)halo change their\norbits and velocities, thus every once in a while the velocity\nc 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 0\u20130\n\n\fOvermerging\nwill be larger than the escape velocity, and a particle will\n'leak' out of the (sub)halo. The timescale for this process is\nabout a hundred times the relaxation timescale (e.g. Binney\n& Tremaine 1987),\nN r\n,\n(3)\nln N v\nso for small N this becomes important. As an example, for\ngalaxy haloes, evaporation becomes an issue for N < 10, as\nthe crossing time for most galaxy haloes is larger than 0.2\nGyr, independent of their mass.\nMoore et al. (1996) tested whether this process gets enhanced for subhaloes within embedding haloes due to the influence of the mean tidal field of the embedding halo. They\nsimulated a collisional group of particles within a smooth,\nand therefore collisionless, isothermal system. They found\nthat the evaporation rate was similar to that for an isolated\ngroup, and concluded that \"relaxation effects are not important at driving mass loss from haloes within current simulations\". Their conclusion is incorrect, however, as they did\nnot consider the particle-subhalo two-body heating process,\nwhich we discuss next.\ntdis \u2261 30\n\n3.2\n\nParticle-subhalo two-body heating\n\nParticles within a subhalo do not just interact amongst\nthemselves (driving the evaporation process describe above),\nbut also with the particles of the embedding halo. As the\nlatter are usually hotter than those of the subhalo, velocity changes to the subhalo particles will always be positive.\nThe process very much resembles the kinetic heating of a\ncold system that is introduced into a hot bath: an embedding halo 'boils' the subhalo into dissolution. A derivation\nfor the disruption timescale of this process is given by van\nKampen (1995, his eq. 15, which is erroneous by a factor of\ntwo):\ntdis \u2248\n\nvs2\nrh\nNh\n.\nvh2 12 ln(rh /2\u01eb) vh\n\n(4)\n\nHere N denotes the number of particles, and the subscripts\nh and s denote embedding halo and subhalo respectively. A\nsimilar expression was given earlier by Carlberg (1994, his\neq. 13 with his indices c and g swapped, no derivation given):\ntdis \u2248\n\nrh\nvs2\nNh\n.\nvh2 8 ln(rh /\u01eb) vh\n\n(5)\n\nWe can rewrite eq. (4), using eq. (2) and the virial theorem\nfor both halo and subhalo, as\n2\n\ntdis \u2248\n\nNs rh rh\nNs3 rh2 \u22121\n\u2248\n\u01eb .\n4 ln Nh rs vh\n8 ln Nh vh\n\n(6)\n\nThis timescale is shorter than that for two-body evaporation, by a factor of (van Kampen 1995)\n100\n\nvh rs2 ln Nh\n,\nvs rh2 ln Ns\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the virial theorem, v 2 \u223c N/r, is used for both systems.\nBecause rh is at least several times rs , the disruption\ntime (6) is at least \u2248 Ns / ln(Nh ) embedding halo crossing\ntimes, which covers the range 0.05 \u2212 0.15Ns crossing times\nfor Nh \u2248 103 \u2212 109 . Thus, it is a much faster process than\ntwo-body evaporation.\nc 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 0\u20130\n\n3.3\n\n3\n\nParticle-subhalo tidal heating\n\nA different cause for overmerging was proposed by Moore\net al. (1996): the tidal heating of subhaloes by particles of\ntheir embedding haloes. Subhaloes are taken to be collisionless, and get disrupted through an increase of their internal\nkinetic energy by tidal distortion from passing N-body particles, which are artificially large as compared to the true\ndark matter halo particles.\nThe time-scale for this process as given by Moore et al.\n(1996; their eq. (3), which is eq. (7-67) of Binney & Tremaine\n1987 with the assumption that the r.m.s. radius is equal to\nthe half-mass radius) reads\ntdis \u2248 0.03\n\nvh ms rp2\n,\nGnp m2p rs3\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the subscript p stands for perturber. The perturber is\nan N-body particle of the embedding halo with mass mp\nand size rp , at a distance q from the centre of the embedding halo.

(1996) then assume the embedding halo to be isothermal, so that np \u2248 vh2 /2\u03c0Gmp q 2 ,\nset the half-mass radius of the subhalo equal to the tidal\nradius, qvs /(3vh ), and assume the subhalo to be virialized.\nThis gives\n\n\u0010\n\ntdis \u2248 94\n\nvh\n1000 km s\u22121\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\nrp\n10 kpc\n\n\u00112 \u0010 109 M \u0011\n\u2299\n\nmp\n\nGyr .\n\n(9)\n\nRelation (8) was originally derived by Spitzer (1958) for\nthe disruption by giant molecular clouds of open star clusters. An important assumption in its derivation is the tidal\napproximation, which is only valid for impact parameters\nb > bmin . Aguilar & White (1985) found that bmin should\nbe at least five times the size of both the perturber and\nthe perturbed system. Binney & Tremaine (1987) use the\ntidal approximation down to bmin = rcluster < rcloud , and\nintroduce a correction factor g = 3 to take into account the\nencounters for which the tidal approximation fails.\nMoore et al. (1996) take this result and apply it to\ntidal interactions between the N-body particles of an embedding halo and its subhaloes theirin. Thus, they set rp to\nthe gravitational softening length \u01eb. However, as the size of\nthe perturbers is now smaller than the size of the perturbed\nsubhaloes, the tidal approximation, even with the correction factor g included, is only valid for b > rs . Therefore,\nsetting rp = \u01eb in eq. (9) is incorrect; instead, one should\nset rp = rs . This means that the timescale becomes (rs /\u01eb)2\n2/3\ntimes longer. Using eq. (2), the time-scale becomes 4Ns\ntimes larger than proposed by Moore et al. (1996).\nBut there is another change to be made, as it is in\nfact the close encounters of halo particles that do the most\ndamage to the subhaloes. According to Binney & Tremaine\n(1987), a good estimate for the disruption timescale can be\nhad from an interpolation between the approximations for\ntidal encounters and for penetrating (b = 0) encounters. For\neach tidal encounter (Binney & Tremaine 1987, their eq.\n7-55),\n(\u2206E)tid =\n\n4G2 m2p ms rs2 1\n,\nb4\n3vh2\n\n(10)\n\nwhile for each penetrating encounter (Binney & Tremaine\n\n\f4\n\nE. van Kampen\n\n1987, their eq. 7-57)\n2\n\n(\u2206E)pen =\n\n4\u03c0G\nvh2\n\nm2p\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nR3\n\u03a3s (R)dR .\n(R2 + \u01eb2 )2\n\n(11)\n\nIf the perturbed subhalo is an isothermal sphere, i.e.\n\u03a3s (R) = vs2 /(6GR) \u2248 0.2mh /(rh R), we find\n(\u2206E)pen \u2248\n\n2G2 m2p ms rs2 1\n.\nvh2\n\u01ebrs3\n\n(12)\n\nInterpolating contributions from the tidal and penetrating\nencounters, i.e.\n\u2206E =\n\n4G2 m2p ms rs2\n1\n,\n3vh2\nb4 + 23 \u01ebrs3\n\n(13)\n\nfinally allows us to integrate over all encounters. Following\nthe procedure of Binney & Tremaine (1987), we simply find\neq. (8) with rp (= \u01eb) replaced by 0.52(\u01ebrs3 )1/2 . Following\nMoore et al. (1996) again we get the same functional form\nas eq. (9), but the timescale is approximately 2(rs /\u01eb)3/2 \u2248\n1/2\n5Ns times longer than estimated by Moore et al. (1996).\nBy definition, ms /mp = Ns , and we use eq. (2) to get\n5\n\ntdis \u2248 4.5Ns6\n\n1 r2\nrh rh\n\u2248 2.2Ns2 h \u01eb\u22121 .\nrs vh\nvh\n\n(14)\n\nAs rh is at least a few times rs , the disruption time is at least\n5/6\n20Ns embedding halo crossing times. It is also a factor of\n\u22121/6\nln Nh \u2248 100 times longer than the particle-subhalo\n18Ns\ntwo-body disruption timescale.\n4\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION\n\nOvermerging is the numerical disruption of subhaloes within\nembedding haloes. Of the three main two-body disruption\nprocesses, particle-subhalo two-body heating is clearly identified as the cause for overmerging. Its timescale is shown to\nbe much shorter than that for the two other processes, twobody evaporation and particle-subhalo tidal heating. Note\nthat softened particles form into more extended subhaloes\nthan is realistic, so they are more vulnerable to these disruption processes (van Kampen 1995), and to possible physical\ndisruption processes as well.\nRecently several research groups used simulations with\na very high resolution in order to resolve the overmerging\nproblem (Klypin et al. 1999a; Ghinga et al. 1998, 1999;\nMoore et al. 1999). Unfortunately, different group finders\nand different definitions for disruption times were used, so\na direct comparison of the results is not straightforward.\nStill, the consensus is that increasing the number of particles overcomes, at least partially, the overmerging problem.\nHowever, the resolution needs to be rather high: for N-body\nsimulations on a cosmological scale, this requires the use\nof at least 109 particles, which is not very practical. Furthermore, for the smallest groups the overmerging problem\nsimply remains.\nAnother option is to include a baryonic component.\nWith the addition of dissipative particles, haloes should be\nmore compact and have a higher central density for the same\nnumbre of particles. However, as Klypin et al. (1999a) remark, there is a limit to this as some fraction of the baryons\ntend to end up in rotationally supported disks. A more practical problem with dissipative particles is the actual simulation techniques needed, which usually is some form of\n\nsmoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The resolution of\nSPH codes is typically not as high as that of N-body codes,\nso for the purpose of resolving the overmerging problem it\nis not a useful alternative at present.\nA third option is to use halo particles, which prevents\novermerging by construction (van Kampen 1995). The idea\nis that a group of particles that has collapsed into a virialised system is replaced by a single halo particle. Local\ndensity percolation, also called adaptive friends-of-friends,\nis adopted for finding the groups. This is designed to identify the embedded haloes that the traditional percolation\ngroup finder links up with their parent halo. By applying\nthe algorithm several times during the evolution, merging of\nalready-formed galaxy haloes is taken into account as well.\nOnce a halo particle is formed, more N-body particles will\ngroup around it at later times. If such a group can virialize,\nit is replaced by a more massive halo particle. This will usually happen in the field. However, for halo particles that end\nup in overdense regions, the particles that swarm around a\nhalo particles will be stripped quite rapidly.\nOnce the overmerging problem is resolved down to the\nsubhalo mass-scale one is interested in, the physical processes can be studied. This is becoming feasible for current\nsimulations. However, whether the physical processes themselves are properly modelled using N-body simulations has\nyet to be proven. The problem of artificially large subhaloes\ndue to softening needs to be solved, for example. Another\nproblem might be the modelling of dynamical friction, which\nrequires a very smooth distribution of particles in the embedding halo in order to produce the wake that generates\nthe drag force.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nI am grateful to John Peacock and Ben Moore for useful\ndiscussion, suggestions and comments.\n\nREFERENCES\nAquilar L.A., White S.D.M., 1985, ApJ, 295, 374\nBinney J., Tremaine S., 1987, Galactic Dynamics, Princeton\nCarlberg R.G., 1994, ApJ, 433, 468\nGelb J., Bertschinger E., 1994, ApJ, 436, 467\nGhigna S., Moore B., Governato F., Lake G., Quinn T., Stadel\nJ., 1998, MNRAS, 300, 146\nGhigna S., Moore B., Governato F., Lake G., Quinn T., Stadel\nJ., 1999, astro-ph/9910166\nKlypin A.A., Gottl\u00f6ber S., Kravtsov A.V., Khokhlov A.M., 1999a,\nApJ, 516, 530\nKlypin A.A., Kravtsov A.V., Valenzuela O., Prada F., 1999b,\nastro-ph/9901240\nMoore B., Katz N., Lake G., 1996, ApJ, 457, 455\nMoore B., Governato F., Quinn T., Stadel J., Lake G., 1998, ApJ,\n499, L5\nMoore B., Ghigna S., Governato F., Lake G., Quinn T., Stadel\nJ., Tozzi P., 1999, ApJ, 524, L19\nSpitzer L., 1958, ApJ, 127, 17\nvan Kampen E., 1995, MNRAS, 273, 295\nWhite S.D.M., Davis M., Efstathiou G., Frenk C.S., 1987, Nat,\n330, 451\n\nc 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 0\u20130\n\n\f"}
