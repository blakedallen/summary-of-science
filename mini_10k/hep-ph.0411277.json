Two and three particle correlations\nare considered in angular space to explain the emission of\nparticles from collectively excited states of the nucleus as a\nFermi liquid drop. Positive correlation is detected only\namong particles emitted in the extreme backward direction\nwhich is the coldest domain, and interpreted as direct nonstatistical emission (splashing) of nucleons via the\ndynamical distortion of the Fermi surface accompanying\nthe collective motion.\n\nTerminology.\nNuclear Emulsion: Is used as a nuclear detector and target simultaneously.\nIt displays traces during the passage of charged particle through it. It is\nconsidered as a complex target formed by two groups of nuclei, a light\ngroup (C,N,O) with average mass number equal 14, and a heavy one\n(AgBr) with average mass of 96 in addition to the hydrogen nuclei.\nGrey particles: Those are the medium ionizing particles appear in grey\ncolor in emulsion detectors, with relative ionization density ~1.4 - 2.\nThese particles are identified as knocked on protons.\nShower particles: Fast particles produced in emulsion detectors, mainly\npions, having ionization density < 1.4.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn previous works [1, 2] we demonstrate a model that describes the\nemission of grey particles in view of a thermodynamic picture. The\n\n\fassumption of local equilibrium as well as the concept of the canonical\nensemble\n\ncould\n\nexplain\n\nthe\n\nformation\n\nof\n\na\n\nnon-equilibrium\n\nthermodynamic nuclear matter in phase space. The formed nuclear\nsystem is divided into sub-domains each is characterized by a local\ncharacteristic\n\ntemperature.\n\nThe\n\nemitted\n\ngrey\n\nparticles\n\nare\n\nthe\n\nsuperposition of the spectra emitted from the different domains. The\nquestion arising now passes around the dynamic effects acting on or\nplaying a role in the process of the emission of the grey particles from the\nnuclear system. The default strategy deliberates with the correlation\ntechnique. The influence of short range correlations in the angular\ndistribution of nucleons in nuclei can be evaluated assuming realistic\ndynamic effect. Many properties of nuclei could be understood within the\nindependent particle model, where the nucleus is considered as a system\nof nucleons moving without residual interaction in a mean field or single\nparticle potential. But the short range of the strong field and other tensor\ncomponents that induce NN correlations in nuclear wave functions cannot\nbe described by the independent particle model or even the Hartree-Fock\napproach. Various tools have been developed to account for these strong\nshort-range correlations. These include variational calculations assuming\nJastrow correlation functions [3], the correlated basis function method\n(CBF) [4], the exponential S method [5], the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock\n(BHF) approximation [6] and the self-consistent Green function approach\n2\n\n\f[7]. In the present work we shall deal with the problem using the twoparticle and the three-particle correlation functions, searching about a true\nsignal in the angular space of the emitted nucleons that can express the\npresence of a dynamic effect.\n\n2. Experimental Work\nA stack of size 20 cm x 10 cm x 600 microns (undeveloped) was exposed\nto the beams of 24Mg nuclei at momentum of 4.5 A GeV/c. The stack was\nirradiated by beam oriented parallel to the length of the stack at the\nDubna Synchro phasotron (Russia). The grain density, the blob density\nand the Lacunarity [8] of the emitted particles are measured and classified\ninto shower (s), grey (g) and black (b) particles [9]. The charge and the\nmass of the emitted particles are identified by a couple of measurements\n(delta ray -energy measurements). In this work we are interested mainly\nin the g-particles. The energy of the g-particles [10] are measured by\neither the range or the Coulomb multiple scattering technique. A special\ncomputer program called (SRIM) [11, 12], is used to calculate the\nstopping and range of ions in energy (10eV \u2013 2GeV/amu) in matter using\na full quantum mechanical treatment of ion-atom (medium) collisions.\nThe space angle of the identified singly charged grey particles were\nmeasured with accuracy less than o0.1\n\n3\n\n\f3. The Short Range Correlations\nA two-particle correlation function R ( z1 , z 2 ) is defined as:\n\n\uf8eb 1 d 2\u03c3\n1 d\u03c3 d\u03c3 \uf8f6 \uf8eb 1 d\u03c3 d\u03c3 \uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 /\uf8ec 2\nR ( z1 , z 2 ) = \uf8ec\uf8ec\n\u2212 2\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec \u03c3 dz dz \uf8f7\ndz\ndz\ndz\ndz\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n1\n2 \uf8f8 \uf8ed in\n1\n2 \uf8f8\nin\n\uf8ed in 1 2\nd \u03c3\nd\u03c3\n\u03c3in ,\nand\ndz1\ndz1dz2\n\n(1)\n\n2\n\nare the inelastic cross-section, the single- and the\n\ntwo-particle distributions, respectively, z1 , z 2 are the values of a certain\nphysical quantity corresponding to the two particles. The correlation\nfunction measures the dependence of the production of the two particles\non their own characteristic parameters. The positive high value of\nR ( z1 , z 2 ) , means that the production of the particle \"1\" depends strongly\n\non the production of particle \"2\", a zero value of R( z1 , z 2 ) means that\ntheir production is independent. On the other hand a negative value of the\ncorrelation function means that the production of one of them prevents\nthe production of the other.\nThe normalized inclusive correlation function can be written for the case\n\nz = cos \u03b8 as\nR (cos \u03b81 , cos \u03b8 2 )\n\uf8eb 1\nd 2\u03c3\nd\u03c3\nd\u03c3 \uf8f6 \uf8eb 1\nd\u03c3\nd\u03c3 \uf8f6\n1\n\uf8f7 /\uf8ec 2\n\uf8f7\n= \uf8ec\uf8ec\n\u2212 2\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec \u03c3 d cos \u03b8 d cos \u03b8 \uf8f7\n\u03c3\nd\n\u03b8\nd\n\u03b8\nd\n\u03b8\nd\n\u03b8\ncos\ncos\ncos\ncos\n\u03c3\n1\n2\n1\n2 \uf8f8 \uf8ed in\n1\n2 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed in\nin\nNN 2 (cos \u03b81 , cos \u03b8 2 )\n=\n\u22121\nN1 (cos \u03b81 ) N1 (cos \u03b8 2 )\n(2)\n\n4\n\n\fN1 (cos \u03b81 ) is the number of interactions having a grey particle between\ncos\u03b81 and\n\ncos \u03b81 + d cos \u03b81 ,\n\nN 2 (cos \u03b81 , cos \u03b8 2 )\n\nis the number of\n\ninteractions having at least two grey particles the first with angle between\ncos\u03b81 , cos \u03b81 + d cos \u03b81 , and the other of angle between cos\u03b8 2 ,\ncos \u03b8 2 + d cos \u03b8 2 and N is the total number of investigated inelastic\ninteractions.

A clear signal of positive\ncorrelation is observed only for the enormously backward emitted\nparticles. In fact this signal has no substantial value, since the cross\nsection of producing grey particles at this angle is very weak as appears\nin Figure (2). Nevertheless, this backward signal may be interpreted as\nthe so called side splash effect; the region of the occurrence depends on\nthe temperature of the domain where the grey particles are produced. The\n\n5\n\n\fprevious results of the thermodynamic model [2, 13, 14] showed that the\nangular distribution of the grey particles is strongly correlated to their\nemission energy, so that fast energetic particles are emitted in the forward\ndirection\n\nfrom\n\ndomains\n\ncharacterized\n\nwith\n\nhigh\n\ntemperature.\n\nAccordingly, it is reasonable to interpret Figure (1) as the increase of the\nvalue of the two particle correlation function toward the colder domain,\nand a true signal is recorded at the coldest zone corresponding to the\nextreme backward emission. The emission of particles from a collectively\nexcited state of the nucleus as a Fermi liquid drop can occur in two ways.\nFirst, due to the relaxation processes where the collective energy is\ntransferred to the intrinsic degrees of freedom with subsequent\nevaporation of particles. On the other hand, a direct non-statistical\nemission (splashing) of nucleons is also possible via the dynamical\ndistortion of the Fermi surface accompanying the collective motion. In\ngeneral the relative contributions of these mechanisms depend upon the\nmagnitude of the nuclear friction coefficient. The limiting cases of the\ndirect (non-statistical) particle emission from the non-damped giant\nmultipole resonance (GMR) and the particle evaporation from the heated\nnucleus may also be considered. The direct particle emission from the\nGMR has been extensively studied within pure quantum mechanical\napproaches [15, 16].\n\n6\n\n\fParticles emitted from excited nucleus due to both the evaporation and\nthe splashing (emission from a cold vibrating nucleus) are due to the\ncollective motion of the nuclear Fermi liquid and are accompanied by\ndirect non-statistical emission of nucleons via the dynamical distortion of\nthe Fermi surface so they are responsible to the presence of the short\nrange correlation.\nThe results displayed in Figure (3) show that the three particle correlation\nfunction has strong negative correlation in the backward direction. This\nmeans that the short range correlation is observed only among the two\nparticles and not among the three grey particles. This means that the\nsplashes come out from the cold nuclear medium are emitted in fine form.\n\n7\n\n\fR (cos\u03b81, cos\u03b82 = cos\u03b81)\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\ncos \u2264\n\nFig. (1)\nTwo particle correlation function for g-particles emitted in Mg-Em\ninteractions at 4.2 A GeV projectile energy.\n\n8\n\n\f16\n\n(dng / dcos \u03b8 g)\n\n%\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\ncos \u03b8 g\n\nFig. (2)\n\nAngular distribution function for g-particles emitted in Mg-Em\ninteractions at 4.2 A GeV projectile energy.\n\n9\n\n1\n\n\fR (cos \u03b81, cos \u03b83 = cos \u03b82 = cos \u03b81)\n\n10\n\n0\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n-30\n\ncos \u25ca(\n\nFig. (3)\n\nThree particle correlation function for g-particles emitted in Mg-Em\ninteractions at 4.2 A GeV projectile energy.\n\n10\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Mohamed Tarek Hussein, Nabila Mohamed Hassan, Naglaa El-Harby\nTr.J.Phys. 4(2000) 1-10, hep-ph/0010001\n[2] M.T.
