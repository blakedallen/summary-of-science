Introduction\nAlthough fourteen years have passed since Eric van Douwen's untimely\ndeath, his work is still of importance to general topologists. His questions\n(many of which remain open) continue to provide ideas and inspiration to all\nof us. This survey collects recent results connected to some of the problems\nset by van Douwen in his posthumous paper [31] on Bohr topology (see\nalso [32, \u00a74], [33] for the list of 200 questions raised by van Douwen in his\npublications with references to the relevant literature). The selection of\nthe problems as well as the the information about their present status, are\ndue to author's personal taste and knowledge, without any pretension for\ncompleteness.\nThe Bohr topology of an abelian group G is the largest totally bounded\ngroup topology on G. It can be realized as the initial topology on G with\nrespect to the family of all homomorphisms of G into the circle group T, i.e.,\nthe topology induced on G under the canonical embedding G \u0592\u2192 THom (G,T) .\nIn the sequel G# will denote the group G equipped with the Bohr topology. The completion of G# is known as the Bohr compactification of G and\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 05D10, 20K45; Secondary 22A05,\n54H11.\nKey words and phrases.

In \u00a72 we outline the problems related to the\ndiscrete sets in the Bohr topology. To the most relevant problem, namely\nthe homeomorphism problem (on whether the Bohr topologies of abelian\ngroups of the same cardinality must be homeomorphic), is discussed in \u00a74.\nThe last section is dedicated to problems related to retracts of G# .\nNotation and terminology. The symbols N, Z and Q are used for the\nset of positive integers, the group of integers and the group of rationals,\nrespectively. The circle group T is identified with the quotient group R/Z\nof the reals R and carries its usual compact\ntopology. The cyclic group of\nL\norder m is denoted by Zm and B\u03ba = \u03ba Z2 denotes the Boolean group of\nsize \u03ba. The p-adic integers are denoted by Jp .\nLet G be a group. The set of torsion elements of G is denoted by tor(G)\n(it is a subgroup of G when G is abelian). For abelian groups G, H we\ndenote by Hom(G, H) the set of all homomorphisms G \u2192 H and call a map\nl : G \u2192 H linear if l(x) = h(x) + a for some h \u2208 Hom(G, H), a \u2208 H and for\nevery x \u2208 G. Since Hom(B\u03ba , T) = Hom(B\u03ba , Z2 ), a typical subbasic open\nneighbourhood of 0 in B\u03ba# is ker \u03c7, for a homomorphism \u03c7 : B\u03ba \u2192 Z2 .\nThe symbol c stands for the cardinality of the continuum, so c = 2\u05d00 . For\nundefined terms see [9, 11, 19, 21].\n2. Some properties of the Bohr topology\nWe list below some well known properties of the Bohr topology.\n\u2022 Every linear map l : G# \u2192 H # is continuous (i.e., the Bohr topology\nis functorial).\n\u2022 For every subgroup H of G:\n\u2013 H # is a topological subgroup of G# ;\n\u2013 (G/H)# carries the quotient topology of G# /H (i.e., the map\nG# \u2192 (G/H)# is open);\n\u2013 if G = H \u00d7 L, then G# = H # \u00d7 L# .\n\u2022 If G has exponent m (that is, (\u2200x \u2208 G) mx = 0), then G# carries\nthe profinite topology (i.e., the finite-index subgroups of G form a\nlocal base at 0).\n\u2022 The weight and the character of G# coincide with 2|G| (so that an\ninfinite G# is never metrizable).\n2.1. Dimension, normality and compactness. van Douwen proved that\nG# is zero-dimensional for every abelian group G ([31, Theorem 4.8]) and\n\n\fVAN DOUWEN'S PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE BOHR TOPOLOGY\n\n39\n\nasked whether it is strongly zero-dimensional [31, Question 4.10]. A positive answer was obtained by Shakhmatov [26] in the following more general setting. He proved that every zero-dimensional totally bounded group\nis strongly zero-dimensional. A further generalization was obtained by\nHern\u00e1ndez [18], who proved that for every locally compact abelian group\nG the Lebesgue covering dimensions of the groups G and G+ coincide (here\nG+ denotes the group G equipped with its Bohr topology, defined as in the\ndiscrete case as the initial topology on G with respect to the family of all\ncontinuous homomorphisms of G \u2192 T). For discrete G this gives another\nsolution of van Douwen's problem.\nvan Douwen proved that G# is not paracompact in cases of interest:\nFact 2.1. [31, Fact 4.11] G# is paracompact iff G# is collectionwise normal\niff G is countable.\nHe asked whether G# is (always) normal ([31, Question 4.10]). TrigosArrieta [29] showed that one can add also \"normal\" in the above chain of\nequivalences, i.e., G# is normal iff G is countable. This result is remarkable,\nsince it gives an easy \"uniform\" example of non-normal group topology\non every uncountable abelian group. Indeed, the known examples of nonnormal Hausdorff topological groups were the uncountable powers of Z or\nfree topological groups [19], i.e., groups with rather stringent conditions on\nthe algebraic structure.\nLet us discuss now the degree of compactness of G# . On one hand it is\ntotally bounded, so close to being compact in this sense. On the other hand,\nsome of the typical properties of the compact groups are not shared by G# .\nIt is well known that the compact groups are dyadic spaces ([20, 24]), so\nthey have plenty of non-trivial convergent sequences. Flor [10] proved that\nthe only convergent sequences in G# are the trivial ones (so G# is never\nsequential). This follows also from the following more general fact, proved\nby Glicksberg [15]: the only compact sets in G# are finite. Flor [10] proved\nalso that actually no non-trivial sequence in G# converges to a point of bG.\nvan Douwen noticed that this follows from the following stronger property\nof G# : if A \u2286 G# is infinite and p \u2208 bG, then there exists a neighbourhood\nU of p in bG such that |A \\ U | = |A| [31, Theorem 1.1.3(a)].\nAs far as other weaker forms of compactness are concerned, it was proved\nby Comfort and Saks [4] that G# is never pseudocompact when G is infinite.\nvan Douwen strengthens this fact by showing that G# is never a Baire space,\nwhen G is infinite [31, Corollary 4.7(b)].\nA. Dow (cf. [31, Fact 4.15]) noticed that G# is not realcompact when |G|\nis Ulam-measurable. This motivated\nQuestion 2.2. [31, Question 4.16] Is G# realcompact if |G| is not Ulammeasurable?\nThis question was answered positively by Comfort, Hern\u00e1ndez and TrigosArrieta ([2, Theorem 3.3]). Moreover, they extended this result to the locally\n\n\f40\n\nDIKRAN DIKRANJAN\n\ncompact case by proving that for a locally compact abelian group G the\ngroup G+ is realcompact if and only if G is realcompact [2, Theorem 3.8].\n3. The relatively discrete sets\nvan Douwen proved that G# contains relatively discrete closed sets of size\n\u03ba for every cardinal \u03ba \u2264 |G| that is not Ulam-measurable (cf. [31, p. 1073],\nthis follows from Theorem 3.6). This is why he asked whether this can be\ndone for all cardinals \u03ba \u2264 |G|, and in particular:\nQuestion 3.1. [31, Question 4.14], [32, \u00a74, Question 83] Does G# contain\nrelatively discrete closed sets of size |G|?\nThe following strong positive answer was obtained by Hart and van Mill\n[16]:\nTheorem 3.2. Every subset A of G# has a relatively discrete subset D such\nthat |D| = |A| and D is closed in G# .\nThe following question of van Douwen is obviously motivated by Question\n3.1 (note that the groups G# have plenty of relatively discrete sets, cf. 3.6).\nQuestion 3.3. [31, Question 4.17], [32, \u00a74.3, p. 20, Question 85] If G# is\ninfinite, does G# have a relatively discrete subset that is not closed ?\nIt was proved by Hart and van Mill [16, Example 0.2] that every Boolean\ngroup B\u03ba admits a relatively discrete subset that is not closed. Namely, the\nset [\u03ba]2 has this property. In other words, the subset D\u03ba = {0} \u222a [\u03ba]2 of B\u03ba#\ncarrying the induced topology has a relatively discrete non-closed subset\n(namely, [\u03ba]2 ).\nIn 1991, Ursul [30] answered positively Question 3.3. Later Protasov\n[25] gave a short and clear proof of a more general result: If A is an infinite\ntotally bounded subset of a topological group G, then the set AA\u22121 contains\na discrete non-closed subset.\nThe following theorem of K. Kunen and W. Rudin [23] provides, in particular, another positive answer to Question 3.3 (just take the set (A\u2212A)\\{0}).\nTheorem 3.4. Every G# contains a relatively discrete set A of size |G|\nsuch that:\n(a) A is C \u2217 -embedded in bG,\n(b) 0 is the only limit point of A \u2212 A,\n(c) A + A has no limit points in G# if (G : G[2]) = |G|.\nAn alternative approach to Question 3.3 is possible due to the above\nmentioned example of Hart and van Mill [16]. Clearly, the groups G# that\ncontain a copy of D\u03c9 are settled by that example. Therefore, it remains to\napply the following result proved in [5]:\nProposition 3.5. Let G be an abelian group, let \u03ba be an infinite cardinal\nand let f : \u03ba \u2192 G be an arbitrary function. Then the map \u03bcf : D\u03ba \u2192 G#\n\n\fVAN DOUWEN'S PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE BOHR TOPOLOGY\n\n41\n\ndefined by \u03bcf (0) = 0 and \u03bcf (\u03b1, \u03b2) = f (\u03b1) \u2212 f (\u03b2) is continuous. Moreover,\nif the family {f (\u03b1) : \u03b1 < \u03ba} is independent, then \u03bcf is an embedding.\nThe only cases left out by the embedding part of Proposition 3.5 are the\ngroups G that do not contain an infinite direct sum of non-trivial subgroups.\nIn such a case G either contains a copy of Z, or a copy of the Pr\u00fcfer group\nZ(p\u221e ). Hence one can argue with G = Z and G = Z(p\u221e ). In both cases\none can easily construct the desired set A as follows. Let B = {bn } be a\ncountable subset of an abelian group G such that:\n(i) 0 6\u2208 B and B \u2229 (B + B) = \u2205;\n(ii) there exists a metrizable totally bounded group topology \u03c4 on G\nsuch that bn \u2192 0 in \u03c4 .\nThen A = (B \u2212 B)\\{0} is a relatively discrete non closed set of G# . Indeed,\nit is easy to see that 0 belongs to the closure of A in any totally bounded\ntopology of G. On the other hand, A is relatively discrete in (G, \u03c4 ), hence\nin G# too. In the case of G = Z (ii) can be ensured if bn+1 /bn tends to\ninfinity, according to [36]. To ensure also (i) take bn = n!. For G = Z(p\u221e )\nthe sequence bn = p\u2212n! + Z works.\nOne can prove that the map \u03bcf in Proposition 3.5 is generic in the following sense: if \u03ba > c and h : D\u03ba \u2192 H # is continuous with h(0) = 0, then\nthere exists an infinite S \u2286 \u03ba and f : S \u2192 D(H) such that h coincides with\n\u03bcf when restricted to {0} \u222a [S]2 ([5]).\n3.1. Relatively discrete, C-embedded sets. van Douwen [31, Theorem\n1.1.3 (a)] showed that\nTheorem 3.6. Every subset A of G# has a relatively discrete subset D such\nthat |D| = |A|, D is C-embedded in G# and C \u2217 -embedded in bG.\nAn alternative proof of this result was given by Galindo and S. Hern\u00e1ndez\n[12]. The following extension of this result to the locally compact case was\nobtained later by the same authors [13]. Let G be an abelian L\u221e -group\nin the sense of [34] (i.e., the topology of G is the intersection of a nonincreasing sequence of locally compact group topologies). For a subset A of\na group G they denote by B(A) the minimum size of a family of bounded\nsets covering A (a subset B of a topological group G is bounded in this sense\nif for every neighbourhood U of 0 \u2208 G there exists a finite subset F of B and\na natural number n such that B is contained in F + |U + .{z\n. . + U} [17]). The\nn\n\nauthors prove that every subset A of G has a relatively discrete subset B\nwith |B| = B(A) and such that B is C-embedded in G+ and C \u2217 -embedded\nin bG (this is the completion of G+ as in the discrete case). When G is\ndiscrete, this obviously gives Theorem 3.6.\n\n\f42\n\nDIKRAN DIKRANJAN\n\n4. The homeomorphism problem\nThe following question of van Douwen [1, Question 515] is motivated by\nthe fact that none of the properties described in \u00a72 depend on the algebraic\nstructure of the group G.\nQuestion 4.1. If G and H are discrete abelian groups of the same cardinality are then G# and H # homeomorphic as topological spaces?\nThe question cannot be found explicitly in [31]. According to the reference\nof [3], it was posed in van Douwen's letters to W. Comfort of 30 June 1986\nand 9 May 1987.\n4.1. The first non-homeomorphism theorems. A negative answer to\nQuestion 4.1 was given by Kunen [22] in 1996:\nL\nL\nTheorem 4.2. [22] ( \u03c9 Zp )# and ( \u03c9 Zq )# are not homeomorphic for\nprimes p 6= q.\nThe proof of this theorem makes use\nLof a Ramsey-style partition property\nof sequences X = hxs : s \u2208 [\u03c9]n i in\n\u03c9 Zq (namely, every sequence splits\ninto a sum of finitely many linearly independent normal forms, cf. [22]). This\nproperty is established by means of Ramsey ultrafilters. Although Ramsey\nultrafilters exist under CH [21], the proof does not depend on CH.\nAnother solution was obtained about the same time by Watson and the\nauthor [8]:\nL\nc\nTheorem 4.3. B\u03ba# and ( \u03ba Z3 )# are not homeomorphic for \u03ba > 22 .\nA different partition theorem was used in [8], based on splitting of the\nsupports of the members of X = hxs : s \u2208 [\u03ba]n i in a many-variable Delta\nsystem lemma style (essentially contained in [35]). Two features should be\nmentioned in the comparison of the partition theorems used in [22, 8]. First,\nthe \"elementary forms\" appearing in these partition theorems are different,\nsecondly, the combinatorics behind the proof is different too. Indeed, while\nthe proof presented in [22] works for countable groups and fully exploits the\nfact that the codomain is a vector space over a finite field, the proof in [8]\nrequires larger groups, but allows for a substantial generalization (see \u00a74.2).\nIt should be mentioned that this approach gives more than just nonhomeomorphism theorems. More precisely, the following theorem was proved\nby Kunen.\nL\nTheorem 4.4. [22] If f : {0}\u222a[\u03c9]4 \u2192 ( \u03c9 Zq )# is a continuous map, where\nL\n{0} \u222a [\u03c9]4 carries the topology induced by ( \u03c9 Zp )# , then f is constant on\n[S]4 for some infinite S \u2286 \u03c9.\nClearly, Theorem 4.2 follows immediately from Theorem 4.4.\nRemark 4.5.\n\n\fVAN DOUWEN'S PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE BOHR TOPOLOGY\n\n43\n\n(a) An analogousLresult holds for \u03ba > 22 and continuous maps f :\n{0}\u222a[\u03ba]4 \u2192 ( \u03ba Z3 )# , where {0}\u222a[\u03ba]4 carries the topology induced\nby B\u03ba# [8]. Here \u03ba > \u03c9 is needed only\nL when | supp f (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4)| is\nunbounded: if f : {0} \u222a [\u03c9]4 \u2192 ( \u03c9 Zq )# is a continuous map,\nwhere | supp f (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4)| is bounded, then f is constant on [S]4 for\nsome\nS \u2286 \u03c9 [8]. Consequently, every continuous map B\u03ba# \u2192\nL infinite\n( \u03c9 Z3 )# is constant on some infinite subset of B\u03ba hence cannot be\na homeomorphism.\nL\n(b) It was shown later in [5] that the group\n\u03ba Z3 in Theorem 4.3 can\nbe replaced by any abelian group without infinite Boolean subgroups\n(cf. Corollary 4.10).\nc\n\nAccording to Proposition 3.5, there is a continuous one-to-one map D\u03ba \u2192\nG# , with \u03ba = |G| for every infinite abelian group G. This shows that one\ncannot argue\nL with doubletons in Theorem 4.4 or in Remark 4.5 (for \u03ba = \u03c9\nand G = \u03c9 Z3 this example was given in [22]).\n4.2. Continuous maps in the Bohr topology. Theorem 4.4 and ReL\nmark 4.5 suggest that continuous maps f : B\u03ba# \u2192 ( \u03ba Z3 )# are \"frequently constant\".\nIt is natural to relate this phenomenon to the fact\nL\nZ\n)\n= 0 for every subgroup L of B\u03ba (so every linear map\nthat Hom(L,\n3\n\u03c9\nL\nL \u2192 \u03c9 Z3 is constant). Hence a general approach to Question 4.1 can be\nbased on the following idea: prove that continuous maps f : G# \u2192 H #\nare always linear on some non-singleton (even infinite) subset of G. If\nHom(L, H) = 0 for every subgroup L of G (this entails G is torsion), then\none obtains a non-homeomorphism theorem in the framework of Question\n4.1. Let us give the relevant definition in a more precise form:\nDefinition 4.6. For abelian groups G, H and A \u2286 G a map f : A \u2192 H\nis linear on A if f coincides on A with the restriction of a linear map l :\nspan(A) \u2192 H.\nThe next example, due to Comfort, Hern\u00e1ndez, Trigos-Arrieta [3] (see also\n5.1), shows that such an \"approximation\" by linear maps is not available in\ngeneral:\nExample 4.7. Q# is homeomorphic to ((Q/Z) \u00d7 Z)# = (Q/Z)# \u00d7 Z# , so\nthere exists an embedding j : (Q/Z)# \u0592\u2192 Q# . Now Hom(A, Q) = 0 for\nevery subgroup A of Q/Z, so every linear map Q/Z \u2192 Q is constant. Thus,\nj is never linear on any non-singleton S \u2286 Q/Z.\n4.2.1. The Straightening Law for Boolean\nL subgroups. The partition property\nof sequences X = L\nhxs : s \u2208 [\u03ba]4 i in \u03c9 Z3 used in [8] is modified in [5] replacing the group \u03ba Z3 by a direct sum of copies of an arbitrary countable\nabelian group. This partition theorem is applied to obtain the following\ntheorem in the framework of the above mentioned programme of \"approximation of continuous maps by linear ones\". For the sake of brevity we call\nit Straightening Law in the sequel.\n\n\f44\n\nDIKRAN DIKRANJAN\n\nTheorem 4.8. Let H be an arbitrary abelian group. If \u03ba > 22 and f :\n{0} \u222a [\u03ba]4 \u2192 H # is a continuous map, where {0} \u222a [\u03ba]4 carries the topology\ninduced by B\u03ba# , then f is linear on {0} \u222a [S]4 for some infinite S \u2286 \u03ba.\nc\n\nConsequently, either f is constant on [S]4 , or f coincides on [S]4 with the\nrestriction of an injective linear map l : span(S) \u2192 H (for some smaller S).\nCorollary 4.9. Let H be an arbitrary abelian group. If \u03ba > 22 and f :\nB\u03ba# \u2192 H # is a continuous map, then there exists an infinite S \u2286 \u03ba such\nthat f is linear on S + S = {0} \u222a [S]2 .\nc\n\nCorollary 4.10. There exist no continuous finite-to-one maps f : G# \u2192\nc\nH # if the abelian group G contains Boolean subgroups of size > 22 and the\nabelian group H admits no infinite Boolean subgroups.\nThis leaves open the following\nQuestion 4.11. For which infinite cardinals \u03ba does there exist a continuous\n1-1 map from B\u03ba# to any torsion-free group H # ?\nto Corollary 4.10. Let us note that also\nSuch a \u03ba must be \u2264 22 according\nL\nthat it suffices the take H = \u03c9 Q.\nIt follows from the Corollary 4.10 that the Bohr topology can detect\nBoolean subgroups in the following sense: If G and H are abelian groups\n2c\n2c\nsuch that the Bohr topologies of the (discrete) powers G2 and H 2 are\nhomeomorphic, then G contains non-trivial Boolean subgroups iff H does.\nNote that |G| = |H| need not hold and the groups may be finite.\nc\n\n4.2.2. The Straightening Law in the general case. It is shown in [6] that\nthe Straightening Law holds (with appropriate modifications) also in the\nmore general context when the Boolean group B\u03ba is replaced by a vector\nspace over the finite field Z/pZ. Therefore, the Bohr topology can measure,\nroughly speaking, also p-subgroups of the abelian groups. Let us note that\nTheorem 4.4 can be considered as a first instance of the Straightening Law\nin this context, since in that situation the constant maps are precisely the\nrestrictions of the linear ones.\nThe proofs in [6] are based on an appropriate combination and development of ideas from [5] and [22] that lead to a partition theorem (in the spirit\nof [22], improving the \"independence\" property\nL of the normal forms) for 'sequences' X = hxs : s \u2208 [\u03ba]n i in direct sums \u03ba K, where K is an arbitrary\ncountable abelian group. The price to pay is to increase the cardinality\nasking \u03ba > in\u22121 . Indeed, easy examples show that countable sequences and\nspaces cannot suffice in the case of vector spaces over a countably infinite\nfield. Let us note also that the partition theorem from [5],\nL easily extendible\nto n-ary sequences X = hxs : s \u2208 [\u03ba]n i in direct sums \u03ba K, cannot help\neither. Indeed, the normal forms in these partition theorems need not be\nindependent as in [22], so such partition theorem cannot be used to obtain\na proof of the Straightening Law following the argument in [5]. It is shown\n\n\fVAN DOUWEN'S PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE BOHR TOPOLOGY\n\n45\n\nin [6] that with some additional care such a kind of independence can be\nachieved.\nFrom now on p will be an arbitrarily fixed prime number and V\u03ba will be\nthe vector space of size \u03ba over Zp . In these terms the Straightening Law\nin the general case can be announced as follows: For \u03ba > i2p\u22121 and a\ncontinuous map \u03c0 : {0} \u222a [\u03ba]2p \u2192 H # , where {0} \u222a [\u03ba]2p is equipped with\nthe induced from V\u03ba# topology, there exists an infinite S \u2286 \u03ba such that \u03c0 is\nlinear on [S]2p [6]. In analogy to the case of Boolean subgroups, one can\nreplace [S]2p by [S]p and assume that the linear map is either constant or\ninjective.\nTheorem 4.12. If \u03ba > i2p\u22121 and f : V\u03ba# \u2192 H # is a continuous map, then\nthere exists an infinite S \u2286 \u03ba such that f is linear on [S]p .\nL\nThis theorem implies that for every continuous self-map f : ( \u03ba Zp2 )# \u2192\nL\nL\n( \u03ba Zp2 )# with \u03ba > i2p\u22121 there exists a subset A of \u03ba Zp2 such that pA\nis infinite and f is linear on [pA]p .\nTheorem 4.12 has also the following immediate consequence.\nCorollary 4.13. If the abelian group H contains\nL no copies of V\u03c9 , then there\nexists no continuous finite-to-one map \u03c0 : ( \u03ba Zp )# \u2192 H # for \u03ba > i2p\u22121 .\nNow we see that there exists no continuous finitely many-to-one map\n\u2192 H # , when H is torsion-free and G is an abelian group with large\np-subgroups for some prime number p.\n\nG#\n\nCorollary 4.14. Let p be a prime number. There exist no finitely manyto-one continuous maps f : G# \u2192 H # if G contains p-subgroups of size\n> i2p\u22121 and H contains no copies of V\u03c9 .\nFollowing [27] we say that an abelian group H is almost torsion-free if H\ncontains no copies of V\u03c9 for every prime p. Corollary 4.14 implies that if G#\nand H # are homeomorphic and H is almost torsion-free, then |tor(G)| \u2264 i\u03c9 .\nThese results give many pairs of groups G and H non-homeomorphic\nin the Bohr topology. For example, when H is almost torsion-free\nwith\nL\n|H| = \u03ba > i2m\u22121 , L is arbitrary with |L| \u2264 \u03ba, and G = L \u00d7 ( \u03ba Zm ).\nCorollary 4.15. Let p be a prime number and let G, H be abelian groups\nsuch that the powers H \u03ba and G\u03ba are homeomorphic in the Bohr topology for\nsome infinite cardinal \u03ba \u2265 i2p\u22121 . Then G contains non-trivial p-subgroups\niff H does.\nCorollary 4.16. If \u03ba \u2265 i\u03c9 and H \u03ba and G\u03ba are homeomorphic in the Bohr\ntopology, then for every prime p, G contains non-trivial p-subgroups iff H\ndoes. In particular, G is torsion-free iff H is torsion-free.\n4.2.3. Stronger form of the Straightening Law. Let us discuss now the limits\nof the Straightening Law. We do not know whether the following stronger\nforms of the Straightening Law hold true. The first one is determined by\nsmaller domain:\n\n\f46\n\nDIKRAN DIKRANJAN\n\nStrong Straightening Law. For every prime number p and for every\ncontinuous map \u03c0 : V\u03c9# \u2192 H # there exists an infinite set Z \u2286 \u03c9 such that\n\u03c0 is linear on [Z]p .\nIt obviously implies that for no almost torsion-free abelian group H there\nis a 1-1 map (Q/Z)(\u03c9) \u2192 H continuous in the Bohr topology. Moreover,\nunder this conjecture, a countable p-group G# embeds into some torsionfree H # iff G contains no copies of V\u03c9 . One can consider also \"local\" forms,\ne.g., about continuous maps B\u03c9# \u2192 H # (or V\u03c9# \u2192 H # for a particular fixed\np).\nTo introduce the next stronger form of the Straightening Law we isolate\nfirst the following corollary of Theorem 4.12.\nCorollary 4.17. If G is a torsion group of size > i\u03c9 , then every continuous\nmap G# \u2192 H # is linear on some infinite set A \u2286 G.\nClearly, \"torsion\" can be replaced by |tor(G)| > i\u03c9 .\nQuestion 4.18. Can \"torsion\" be completely removed in the above corollary?\nIn other words, does the corollary work with groups with \"small\" torsion part? Therefore, the second form (we formulate it as a question) is\ndetermined by torsion-free domain.\nQuestion 4.19. If G is a sufficiently large torsion-free group, is then every\ncontinuous map G# \u2192 H # linear on some infinite set A \u2286 G?\nClearly, \"torsion-free\"\ncan be replaced by \"free abelian\", i.e.,\nL\nLis every\ncontinuous map ( \u03ba Z)# \u2192 H # linear on some infinite set A \u2286 \u03ba Z ? In\nparticular, the following question is left open.\nQuestion 4.20. Does there exist a continuous injective map Z# \u2192 T # ,\nwith T torsion abelian group?\nL\nOne can always take T = \u03c9 Q/Z.\n. Now we shall discuss the third stronger form of the Straightening Law \u2013\nwhen restriction to subgroups of continuous maps (in the Bohr topology)\nare linear. According to Theorem 4.8, if \u03ba > i3 and f : B\u03ba# \u2192 H # is a\ncontinuous map, then f is linear on infinitely many non-trivial subgroups\nof B\u03ba . Namely, if f is linear on [S]4 for an infinite S \u2286 \u03ba, then f is linear\non A = S + S + S + S = {0} \u222a [S]2 \u222a [S]4 = [S]4 , so f is linear on every\ncyclic subgroup span(a), a \u2208 A, as well as on any 2-generated subgroup of\nB\u03ba with generators from S. It is clear, that taking a larger \u03ba (depending on\nk), one can obtain linearity on A = {0} \u222a [S]2 \u222a . . . \u222a [S]2k = [S]2k for any\nfixed k \u2208 N. Then f is linear on every 2k-generated subgroup of B\u03ba with\ngenerators from S. This leaves open the following:\nQuestion 4.21. Is f linear on some infinite subgroup of B\u03ba if \u03ba is sufficiently large?\n\n\fVAN DOUWEN'S PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE BOHR TOPOLOGY\n\n47\n\nQuestion 4.22. When every continuous map G# \u2192 H # is linear on some\ninfinite subgroup of G?\nPossible restraints to impose on G are: \"large\", Boolean, G \u223c\n= V\u03ba for some\nlarge \u03ba.\nQuestion 4.23. Do there exist continuous maps f : G# \u2192 H # with uncountable G, that are not linear on any infinite subgroup of G?\nClearly, one has to rule out maps as j : (Q/Z)# \u0592\u2192 Q# by asking the\nexistence of infinite subgroups A of G with Hom(A, H) 6= 0.\n\n5. Retracts of G#\nvan Douwen posed also the following questions about retracts of G# :\nQuestion 5.1. [31, Question 4.12] Is every subgroup H of a group G# a\nretract of G# ?\nLet us recall that every subgroup of G# is closed.\nQuestion 5.2. [31, Question 4.13] Is every countable closed subset of G# a\nretract of G# ?\nRemark 5.3. If a closed relatively discrete set R \u2286 G# is a retract of G# ,\nthen R is countable. Indeed, if r : G# \u2192 R is a retract, then r \u22121 (R) is\ndisjoint union of |R| open pairwise disjoint sets of G# . Since c(G) = \u03c9, this\nimplies R is countable. It remains to note that if G is uncountable, then\nG# admits a relatively discrete subset R of size |G| (by Theorem 3.6). This\nexplains why countable is imposed in Question 5.1.\nA negative answer to the second question was obtained by Gladdines [14]\nin 1995. Now we offer a new much shorter proof of her theorem based on the\nnon-homeomorphism theorems and the better knowledge of the continuous\nmaps in the Bohr topology obtained after 1995.\nTheorem 5.4. [14] D\u03ba = {0} \u222a [\u03c9]2 is not a retract of B\u03c9# .\nL\nProof. Assume that r : B\u03c9# \u2192 {0} \u222a [\u03c9]2 is a retraction. Let H = \u03c9 Z3 , let\nhen : n < \u03c9i be the canonical base of H and let \u03bc : {0} \u222a [\u03c9]2 \u2192 H # be the\ncontinuous map defined by \u03bc(0) = 0 and \u03bc(n, m) = en \u2212 em for n < m < \u03c9.\nThen \u03c0 = \u03bc\u25e6r : B\u03c9# \u2192 H # is continuous with | supp \u03c0(x)| \u2264 2 for all x \u2208 B\u03c9 ,\nso there exists an infinite subset S \u2286 \u03c9 such that \u03c0 vanishes on [S]4 (cf.\nTheorem 4.4 or Remark 4.5 (a)), hence also on [S]2 \u2286 [S]4 . A contradiction,\n\u0003\nsince \u03c0 \u21be [S]2 = \u03bc \u21be [S]2 is injective (being r \u21be [S]2 = id[S]2 ).\n\n\f48\n\nDIKRAN DIKRANJAN\n\n5.1. Subgroups as retracts. Question 5.2 is still open. Here we offer a\ncomment on what was done so far.\nIn B\u03ba every subgroup L splits off B\u03ba = L \u00d7 K, hence L is a topological\ngroup retract in B\u03ba# = L# \u00d7 K # . The same applies to V\u03ba# . In general, if H\nhas finite index in G, then H is clopen in G# , hence H is a retract of G#\n(for other instances see [28]).\nA substantial contribution towards a solution to this problem was given\nby Comfort, Hern\u00e1ndez and Trigos-Arrieta [3] by the introduction of an\nimportant notion that helps to understand better the nature of the retract\nproblem in the case of subgroups. They call a subgroup H of an abelian\ngroup G a ccs-subgroup if the the natural map \u03c6 : G# \u2192 G# /H has a\ncross section \u0393 : G/H \u2192 G that is continuous in the Bohr topology of\nG and G/H. It is easy to see that in such a case G# is homeomorphic to\n(G/H)# \u00d7 H # . In particular, H is a retract of G# and (G/H)# embeds\ninto G# . The existence of a Bohr-continuous cross section \u0393 : G/H \u2192 G is\nequivalent to the existence of a retraction G# \u2192 H # such that r(x + h) =\nr(x)+h for every h \u2208 H and every x \u2208 G (so that r is a linear retraction [3]).\nIn this sense the study of ccs-subgroups, proposed in [3], is a very natural\nmodification of van Douwen's Question 5.1.\nComfort, Hern\u00e1ndez and Trigos-Arrieta [3] introduced the class ACCS(#)\nof abelian groups H that are ccs-subgroups of any abelian group that contains them and they showed that H \u2208 ACCS(#) iff H is a ccs-subgroup of\nits the divisible hull. They showed that the class ACCS(#) is closed under\nfinite products and contains all finitely generated groups (and, of course, all\ndivisible groups).\nHere are some further examples of groups from ACCS(#):\nExample 5.5.\n(a) ([3]) Zn \u2208 ACCS(#) and consequently, (Qn /Zn )# embeds into\n(Qn )# for every n < \u03c9. We repeat this example in view of its\nimportance.\nL\n(b) ([3])\nFor\nevery\nprime\np\nthe\ngroup\n\u03c9 Zp is not a ccs-subgroup of\nL\nL\nZ\ndoes\nnot\nbelong to ACCS(#)).\nZ\n2 (so the group\np\np\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n(c) ([7]) Let \u03c0 be an arbitrary non-empty set of prime numbers.\n(i) The additive group H\u03c0 of the subring of Q generated by the set\n{1/p : p \u2208 \u03c0} belongs to ACCS(#) (for a singleton \u03c0 = {p}\nthis was mentioned also in [3]). By varying \u03c0 this gives c many\npairwise non-isomorphic rank-one torsion-free (reduced) groups\nin ACCS(#).Q\n(ii) The product p\u2208\u03c0 Jp belongs to ACCS(#), where Jp denotes\nthe group of p-adic integers. By varying \u03c0 this gives c many\npairwise non-isomorphic reduced groups of size c.\nSome new restraints for the groups from ACCS(#) are given in [7]. They\ngive an upper bound for the size of the reduced groups in ACCS(#) (so\nthat the reduced groups in ACCS(#) form a set) and entails that large\n\n\fVAN DOUWEN'S PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE BOHR TOPOLOGY\n\n49\n\npowers may belong to ACCS(#) only if they are divisible.
