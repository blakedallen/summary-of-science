R. C. Solis\nTheoretical Physics Group\nNational Institute of Physics\nUniversity of the Philippines,\nDiliman,Quezon City\n1101 PHILIPPINES\ne-mail: msolis@nip.upd.edu.ph\nTeachers and students alike have often wondered\nwhy some people are more succesful at mathematics\nand physics than others. It is tempting to believe that\nsome people are just smarter than others. It is a flattering explanation, if you happen to be among the\nsuccesful people, while at the same time offering consolation for other people, e.g. \"I just don't have a\nmathematical mind\".\nI believe though, that there is another explanation.\nPeople good at math and physics are succesful not\nbecause they're smarter than the rest of us (although\nbeing a bit smarter than the rest of us does help!).\nRather, the explanation is found in the habits that\nthey've developed.\nIt is unfortunate that these habits aren't often\ntaught to freshmen because they stand to benefit\nmost. It is hoped that some effort be made in\nphysics departments to promote these habits. Oxford\nand Cambridge University provide booklets explaining these points to their freshmen mathematics majors. Something similar might be done for freshmen\nphysics majors.\nTo explain these habits, I shall concentrate on how\nto apply these habits to the study of mathematics.\nThis article contains some observations on mathematically successful people as well as some of the tricks\nthat I have learned while grappling with the material. This article doesn't contain any new mathematics; instead, it is intended to help you learn how to do\nmathematics.1\n\n1\n\nthe clearest explanation. Furthermore, a clear explanation is easier to remember than a complicated one.\nThe rules of coherence also help you write papers\nthat you intend to submit for publication. By following these rules, you may go a long way towards making\nthe reading of your work a pleasurable experience.\n\u2022 Math is prose. This means mathematics (at\nleast, as used by the physicist) is a language as\nwell as a means towards getting the answers we\nwant. Since it is a language, we must make an\neffort to integrate it carefully with our ordinary\nEnglish prose, or whatever language we are using.\nFor example, \"using the angle addition formulae\nfor cosines\n(1)\n\ncos(x-y) = cosxcosy + sinxsiny\n\n(2)\n\nwe may easily derive the formula...\"\nThis is an important rule that most students seem\nto forget whenever they have to pass solutions to\nassigned problem sets. What they submit is usually a stream of equations without signposts for\nthe poor reader (in this case, the instructor) as to\nhow they got which from what. Symbols are left\nundefined, assumptions and theorems used are\nnot explicitly stated, etc. Is it any wonder that\nthe instructor therefore descends like an avenging\nangel on their work, trailing red ink in his wake?\n\u2022 Fisher's rule This rule is named after one of\nthe teachers of N. David Mermin. It is simply\nstated: Number all equations. We do this to make\nour solutions clear. Instead of referring to \"the\nfirst equation in the introduction,\" we instead say\nsomething like \"from the angle addition formulae\nfor cosines (2).\"\n\nThe Rules of Coherence\n\nIn this section, we will learn how to write down solutions. This is an important skill, because continued\npractice of the rules of coherence forces you to seek\n1 The\n\ncos(x+y) = cosxcosy \u2212 sinxsiny\n\nmethods suggested here are also useful in physics!\n\n1\n\n\fThere is a variant of Fisher's rule, called Occam's\nrule, which Mermin calls a heresy: Number all\nequations you think you might want to refer to. I\ndo not recommend it. For example, what happens\nif you wish to add another equation, or what if\nyou eventually want to cite an equation that you\nleft unnumbered? You would have to go through\nthe painful process of renumbering by hand. This\nis okay if your work is a mere three pages, but it is\na nightmare if you wish to fix a two hundred-page\nmanuscript.\n\u2022 The Good Samaritan Rule A good Samaritan is someone who helps people in distress, and\nnothing is more distressing than the appearance\nof \"from equation (3.3.10)\", an equation found in\nchapter3, when you are working on something in,\nsay, chapter 17. It is annoying especially when\nyou're reading something as massive as MTW2 ,\nand you have to flip through five hundred pages\njust to figure out what the equation is all about.\nThus, Mermin proposed the Good Samaritan\nrule: Add explanatory text. For example, when\nciting an equation, introduce it with a descriptive\nphrase as well as an equation number.\nYou might ask, \"Why bother with the good\nsamaritan rule at all?\". After all, you might\nthink, you understand your solution. It may be\nso today, but what if you had to read your solution three years from now? (See \"file your work\")\nThe good samaritan rule exists so that you will\nbe able to understand your solution, say, twenty\nyears from now.\nThe good samaritan rule is also useful when\nyou're writing computer programs. It isn't hard\nto add explanatory text (comments!) to computer programs. Comments make the job of understanding your code easier for other people and\nyourself.\n\u2022 Cite your sources. This rule is about honesty.\nIf your pal helped you work out a difficult mathematical problem, acknowledge his or her help.\nIf your formula came from Arfken or from Whittaker and Watson, say so and include the page\n(and equation number), edition, etc.\nAside from honesty, citing sources is especially\nuseful if you want to recheck your work. Sources\naren't infallible. Reproducing previously done\nwork adds to the length of our soultions. Citing\n2 Gravitation\n\nby Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (a classic\nGeneral Relativity text )\n\nsources is a convenient way of avoiding having to\nredo what might be a long calculation. 3\nThe rules of coherence boils down to a simple question: can my solution serve as supplementary lecture\nnotes? If yes, then the rules of coherence are satisfied.\nIf no, you need to rework your solution until it satisfies\nthe rules of coherence.4\n\n2\n\nOther habits\n\nAside from the rules of coherence, there are other\nuseful habits.\n\u2022 File your work. It is part of the fallen state of\nman that he forgets. If you spent a week thinking about a problem, and you were asked about\nit three years later, wouldn't it be frustrating to\nfind out that you have absolutely forgotten how to\nsolve the problem? If you had it on file, re-reading\nyour work could save you what might have been\nanother week of thinking.\nThere is no guarantee that the solutions you submit will be returned to you. Therefore, always\nmake two copies of your solution\u2013 one for yourself, and another for your instructor. This isn't\ndifficult today, for ours is the age of the photocopying machine.\nThis is how I file my work. I have folders with\nlabels for the various things that interest me. As\nsoon as I have solved something, I produce a neat\nwrite-up and file it in the relevant folder. I make\nsure that I write down when I solved it, and if the\nproblem was really tough, I also include wrong\nattacks on the problem, as well as the length of\ntime (days, weeks, months, or even years) I spent\non it. You might have your own filing system. If\nso, use the filing system that is most convenient\nfor you. So long as you file whatever it is that\nyou worked on.\n\u2022 Study ahead. This is something that I discovered after carefully watching the ur-Geek in\nthe theoretical physics group. Before taking a\ngraduate-level quantum mechanics course, this\nguy sat through a year of lectures (as an undergrad!) and worked on a sizable number of problems. Is it any wonder he aced the class?\n3 Although it doesn't remove the burden of making sure that\nthe source we used is indeed reliable!\n4 This statement of the rules of coherence is due to N. David\nMermin, unpublished lecture notes.\n\n\f\u2022 Solve as many problems as you can. The\nonly way to test your understanding of the material in the lectures or in your book is by working\non the problems. I am of course, assuming that\nyou follow the other rules as well. The aforementioned rules help keep you honest. It is almost\nimpossible to fool yourself if you conscientiously\nfollow Fisher, the Good Samaritan, etc. If there\nare gaps in your understanding, you will eventually reach a point where you cannot justify the\nsteps you made. When you find yourself unable\nto explain the origins of an equation, it means you\nhave to do some more reading and thinking.\n\u2022 Talk to other people. One of the best ways\nof learning is by talking it over with a friend, a\ncolleague, or a professor. Try to explain the idea\nyou've learned to other people. It is very easy\nto fool oneself. Other people provide feedback by\nasking questions and making you clarify things.\nIncidentally, the rules of coherence and the other\nhabits might provide an explanation for the Feynman\neffect. As everyone knows, Feynman is legendary for\nhis deep understanding of physics. Based on secondhand reports 5 , Feynman had an extensive filing syste.\nFeynman even preserved his Far Rockaway notebooks,\nthe ones he used as a high school student to teach himself trigonometry and calculus! By filing his work, he\nhad an enormous storehouse of previous work, just\nwaiting for an opportunity to be used in other areas\nof his research.\n\n3\n\nFinal Words\n\nIn this article, we have examined some helpful\nhabits. There are others, of course. Based on an informal survey these habits aren't as widespread among\nundergraduate physicists. This is a pity, because we\nhave a lot to gain from these habits.\nPhysics and mathematics are difficult enough without the aditional burden of bad habits. It is hoped\nthat by explaining these habits to our students, and\nencouraging the adoption of these habits, they will end\nup with a deeper understanding of mathematics and\nphysics.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author wishes to thank the members of the GR\nstudy group: A.
