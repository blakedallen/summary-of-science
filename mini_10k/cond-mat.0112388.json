Early experimental data for electrolytes\nexhibiting phase separation driven by long-range ionic\nforces suggested classical or van der Waals (vdW) critical behavior, with exponents \u03b2 = 12 , \u03b3 = 1, \u03bd = 12 ,\netc. [1, 2]: But the general theoretical consensus has been\nthat asymptotic Ising-type criticality, with \u03b2 \u2243 0.326,\n\u03b3 \u2243 1.239, \u03bd \u2243 0.630, etc., should be expected [1, 3, 4].\nNaively, one may argue that the exponential Debye\nscreening of the direct ionic forces results in effective\nshort-range attractions that can cause separation into\ntwo neutral phases: ion-rich and ion-poor [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nthe order parameter, namely, the ion density or concentration difference, is a scalar; so Ising-type behavior is\nindicated. Field-theoretic approaches support this picture [6].\nHowever, the theoretical arguments are by no means\nrigorous and have not, so far, been tested by precise calculations for appropriate models. To do that is the aim\nof the researches reported here. We have studied a finelydiscretized version [7] of the simplest continuum model\n(considered by Debye and H\u00fcckel in 1923 [1, 2], three\nyears before Ising's work), namely, the restricted primitive model (RPM), consisting of N = N+ + N\u2212 equisized hard spheres of diameter a, precisely half carrying\na charge +q0 and half \u2212q0 , in a medium (representing a\nsolvent) of dielectric constant D. At a separation r \u2265 a,\nlike (unlike) ions interact through the potential \u00b1q02 /Dr;\nthus appropriate reduced density, \u03c1 = N/V for volume V ,\nand temperature variables are\n\u03c1\u2217 = \u03c1a3 ,\n\nT \u2217 = kB T Da/q02 ,\n\nt = (T \u2212 Tc )/Tc . (1)\n\nExcept at low densities and high temperatures, when\nthe inverse Debye length \u03baD a = (4\u03c0\u03c1\u2217 /T \u2217 )1/2 is small,\nthe RPM is intractable analytically or via series expansions [1, 3, 8]. However, it has been much studied\nby Monte Carlo (MC) simulations [1, 9, 10, 11] which\nhave recently approached the consensus Tc\u2217 \u2243 0.049,\n\n\u03c1\u2217c = 0.060\u20130.085. However, these values have been derived by assuming Ising-type criticality: on that basis\nBruce\u2013Wilding extrapolation procedures have been employed [9, 10] (which, even then, neglect potentially important, asymmetric 'pressure-mixing' terms [12].) It\nmust be stressed that implementing appropriate finitesize extrapolation methods constitutes the heart of the\ncomputational task since a grand-canonical (GC) system\nconfined in a simulation 'box' of dimensions L \u00d7 L \u00d7 L\n(with, say, periodic boundary conditions [13]) cannot exhibit a sharp critical point; a finite canonical system may\nbecome critical but can display only classical or vdW behavior [14].\nThus, while previous RPM simulations [9, 10] demonstrate consistency with Ising (or n = 1) behavior, no\nother universality classes are ruled out: see also [11, 14,\n15]. Putative 'nearby' candidates are XY or n = 2 systems (with \u03b3 \u2243 1.316, \u03bd \u2243 0.670), self-avoiding walks\n(SAWs, n = 0: with \u03b3 \u2243 1.159, \u03bd \u2243 0.588) [14, 16]\nand long-range, 1/rd+\u03c3 scalar systems (with d = 3,\n\u03c3 < 2 \u2212 \u03b7) [15, 17]. On the other hand, in a preparatory GCMC study II [14(b)] of the hard-core squarewell (HCSW) fluid-for which Ising criticality has long\nbeen anticipated-new, unbiased, finite-size extrapolation techniques enabled the n = 2 and 0 classes to be\nconvincingly excluded.\nPresent approach.-We have now applied the methods of II to the RPM; however, the extreme asymmetry of the critical region in the model (see Fig. 1) has\ndemanded further developments. By extending finitesize scaling theory [18] and previous applications of the\nBinder parameter or fourth-moment ratio [17, 18, 19]\nQL (T ; \u03c1) \u2261 hm2 i2 /hm4 i\n\nwith m = \u03c1 \u2212 h\u03c1i ,\n\n(2)\n\n[20] to systems lacking symmetry, we have assembled evidence, outlined below, that excludes not only classical\ncriticality in the RPM but also the XY and SAW universality classes and (d = 3) long-range Ising criticality with\n\u03c3<\n\u223c 1.9.\nOur work employs multihistogram reweighting [21] and\n\n\f2\n0.07\n\n\u03b8\n\nT*\n\n0.056\n\n9\n\nQ\n\n1.4\n12\n\n+\n\u03b3eff\n\nk=1\n0.06\n7\n\n0.03\n\n0.06\n\n\u2190n=2\n\n1.3\n\n12\n\n0.046\n0.09\n\n\u2190n=1\n1.2\n\u2190n=0\n\n0.05\n\n15 12\n\n1.1\n\n9\n\n8\n\nvdW\n0.04\n\n7\n\n1.0\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n\u03c1*\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\nFIG. 1: Approximate coexistence curve of the RPM in the\n(T, \u03c1) plane: open circles and fitted line.

However, the variation of the k loci when\nL increases is significantly more complicated in the RPM\nthan in the HCSW fluid [11(c), 23].\nExtrapolation of the effective susceptibility exponents\nin Fig. 2 and those on the k = 0 locus, etc. [11(c)], to t =\n0 indicates \u03b3 = 1.24(3), upholding Ising-type behavior\nwhile both XY and SAW values are implausible.\nTo determine the exponent \u03bd we have examined the\npeak positions, Tj (L), of various properties, Yj (T ; L), on\nthe critical isochore. Finite-size scaling theory [18] yields\n\u2206Tj (L) \u2261 Tj (L) \u2212 Tc \u223c L\u22121/\u03bd : Figure 3 demonstrates\nthe estimation of 1/\u03bd (unbiased except for the imposed Tc\nestimate) from the ratios \u2206Tj (L1 )/\u2206Tj (L2 ) for various\nj (see [11(c)]), using an established approach [see I(7)\u2013\n(13), Fig. 1; II(3.1)]. The data indicate \u03bd = 0.63(3),\nexcluding classical but supportive of Ising (n = 1) criticality, while n = 2 and 0 seem less probable.\nEstimation of Tc\u2217 .-Consider, now, QL (T ; \u03c1) in (2),\nwhen L \u2192 \u221e. In any single-phase region of the (T, \u03c1)\nplane QL \u2192 31 , indicative of Gaussian fluctuations about\nh\u03c1i; conversely, within a two-phase region, \u03c1\u2212 (T ) < \u03c1 <\n\u03c1+ (T ), one finds QL \u2192 1 on the diameter, \u03c1\u0304(T ) \u2261 21 (\u03c1\u2212 +\n\u03c1+ ) for T < Tc , while, more generally,\n1 \u2265 Q\u221e (T ; \u03c1) = 1 \u2212 4y 2 /(1 + 6y 2 + y 4 ) >\n\n1\n2\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere |y| = 2|\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304(T )|/(\u03c1\u2212 + \u03c1+ ) < 1. Finally, at\ncriticality, QL (Tc ; \u03c1c ) approaches a universal value Qc\nwhich, for cubic boxes with periodic boundary conditions, is Qc = 0.4569 * * * for classical (vdW) [19(b)] or\n\u221e-range systems [19(c)] but Qc (n = 1) = 0.6236(2) for\nIsing [19(d),(e)] and Qc (n = 2) = 0.8045(1) for XY [19(f)]\n\n\f3\n2.5\n\n0.14\n\n2.0 \u2190 vdW\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n0.12\n\n\u03c1*\n\nn=0\u2192\nn=1\u2192\nn=2\u2192\n\n(\u03c8 , l0 , A )\n(a): (2.0, 5.0, 6.0)\n(b): (1.7, 3.0, 2.7)\n(c): (1.4, 1.5, 1.4)\n(d): (1.2, 0.5, 1.0)\n\n0.10\n\n1.0\n\n0.08\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\n0.12\n\n0.14\n\n1/L*\n\n1.0\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n11\n\n0.64\n\n0.8\n0.60\n\nQ\n0.0505\n\nIsing\n\n0.0510\n\n0.6\nL*=7\nvdW\nL*=9\n0.4\n0.045\n\n0\n\n0.03\n\n0.06\n\n\u03c8\n\n0.09\n\n0.12\n\nFIG. 5: Estimation of \u03c1\u2217c from plots of (k = 0) and Q locus\nvalues at Tc (open and solid squares) vs A/(L\u2217 + l0 )\u03c8 for\nvarious values of \u03c8 and optimal shifts l0 .

Classical, XY and Ising values of Q\nare shown.\n\nsystems, while Qc (n = 0) = 0 [19(b)]. For long-range,\n1/r3+\u03c3 systems, Qc (\u03c3) and also \u03b3(\u03c3), increase almost\nlinearly from vdW to Ising values in the interval 23 \u2264\n\u03c3 \u2264 (\u03b3/\u03bd)n=1 \u2243 1.966 with Qc (\u03c3 = 1.9) \u2243 0.600 and\n\u03b3(\u03c3 = 1.9) \u2243 1.205 [17(b)].\nThe result (3) leads us to propose Q-loci, \u03c1Q (T ; L), on\nwhich QL (T ; \u03c1) is maximal at fixed T . For T < Tc these\nloci are observed to approach the diameter \u03c1\u0304(T ) when L\nincreases. (For T <\n\u223c Tc , but not above Tc , the Q-loci also\nfollow the k = 0 loci quite closely.)\nFigure 4 displays QL (T ; \u03c1) on the Q-loci \u03c1Q (T ; L), for\nL\u2217 = 7\u201312. As often seen in plots for symmetric systems [19], inflection points and successive intersections,\nTQ (L), almost coincide! Scaling yields QL (Tc ; \u03c1c ) \u223c\nL\u2212\u03b8/\u03bd and |Tc \u2212 TQ (L)| \u223c L\u2212\u03c6 with \u03c6 = (1 + \u03b8)/\u03bd, where\n\n\u03b8 (= \u03c9\u03bd) is the leading correction-to-scaling exponent;\nfor classical and Ising criticality one has (\u03b8/\u03bd, \u03c6) = (1, 3),\n\u2243 (0.82, 2.41) [16]. With this guidance, the large-scale inset in Fig. 4 leads to our estimate Tc\u2217 \u2243 0.05069(2) but\nalso yields Qc \u2243 0.624(2): this is surprisingly close to\nthe Ising value [24] and far from the vdW, XY, and SAW\nvalues-an unexpected bonus! Likewise, 1/r3+\u03c3 effective\npotentials with \u03c3 \u2264 1.9 are excluded.\nEstimation of \u03c1c .-Finally, we examine \u03c1c0 (L) and\nc\n\u03c1Q (L), i.e., the (k = 0) and Q loci intersections with\nthe estimated critical isotherm, T = Tc . According to\nscaling, the deviations, \u2206\u03c1c0 and \u2206\u03c1cQ , decay as L\u2212\u03c8 with\n\u03c8 = (1 \u2212 \u03b1)/\u03bd [18], so we may suppose 1.2 < \u03c8 \u2264 2 [16].\nFigure 5 displays the deviations vs L\u2212\u03c8 for \u03c8 = 1.2, 1.4,\n1.7 and 2 with 'l0 shifts' [I(19), Fig. 2; II(3.1)] chosen to\nprovide linear plots. From these and further plots [11(c)]\nwe conclude \u03c1\u2217c = 0.0790(25).\nIn further support of our \u03c1c estimate, we mention first\nthat\n), is plotted vs\n\u221a \u2217 when the coexistence curve, \u03c1\u00b1 (Tj/2\nfor integral j\n\u03c1 -as is reasonable since all powers \u03c1\nappear in virial expansions for the RPM [8]-it becomes\nmarkedly more symmetrical [resembling (\u03c1, T ) plots for\nthe HCSW and other\nfluids]. p\nThen, the\np simple\np corresponding diameter,\n[\u03c1\u0304\u22171/2 (T )] = 12 ( \u03c1\u2217\u2212 + \u03c1\u2217+ ), is\nonly mildly curved and naive extrapolations to Tc yield\n\u03c1\u2217c = 0.078(4).\nIn conclusion.-By implementing recently tested [14]\nand newly devised extrapolation techniques for nonsymmetric critical systems, our extensive grand-canonical\nMonte Carlo simulations for the RPM have provided,\nin toto, convincing evidence to exclude classical, XY\n(n = 2), or SAW (n = 0) critical behavior as well as\nlong-range (effective) Ising interactions decaying more\n\n\f4\nslowly than 1/r4.90 . Rather, the estimates for the exponents \u03bd and \u03b3, and for the critical fourth-moment ratio,\nQc , point to standard, short-range Ising-type criticality.\nStudies underway [11(c)] should provide further confirmation and additional quantitative results, such as the\nscale, R0 , of the equivalent single-component short-range\nattractions generated by the RPM near criticality.\nWe are indebted to Young C. Kim for extensive assistance in the numerical analysis, for his elucidation\nof the finite-size scaling properties of asymmetric fluid\ncriticality [18], and his discovery of effective estimators\nfor \u03bd.
