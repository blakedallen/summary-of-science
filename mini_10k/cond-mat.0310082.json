Several beautiful works on the thermodynamics of self-gravitating systems\n[5,6] have shown peculiar features such as a negative specific heat and the absence of global entropy\nmaxima, which is referred to as the gravothermal catastrophe. (For a general introduction to this\nsubject, see [7].) Furthermore, the long-range nature of the gravitational interaction makes a discussion\nof the relationship between non-extensive thermostatistics the self-gravitating systems tempting.\nRecently, a new framework for thermodynamics based on Tsallis' non-extensive entropy was proposed [8]. It has been applied extensively to deal with a variety of interesting problems to which standard Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics can not be applied [9,10]. The study of self-gravitating\nstellar systems has been one of the most interesting applications of Tsallis' framework of thermostatistics (see, e.g., [11,12,13]). Here, some of the progress in its application to stellar systems [14,15,16,17]\nwill be reviewed. Although its dynamics is complicated in general, if we impose spherical symmetry\non the system, its treatment is considerably simplified due to the well-known 1/r2 behavior of the\ngravitational force. Furthermore the spherical system still keeps the remarkable nature of a negative\nspecific heat [5,6]. Thus, self-gravitating stellar systems seem to be a desirable testing ground for\nTsallis' non-extensive thermostatistics.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we briefly review the principal characteristics of\nself-gravitating systems. In particular, the standard treatment for the gravothermal catastrophe based\nCorrespondence to: M.

Then, its extension to the Tsallis entropy is discussed in\nsection 3. The properties of states of the stellar system that extremize the Tsallis entropy are clarified.\nIn section 4, the interesting role of the above states as quasi-equilibria is discussed from the results of\nnumerical simulations. Finally, section 5 is devoted to discussion and conclusions.\n\n2 Some basic properties of the self-gravitating systems\nIn order to get an intuitive understanding of the evolution of many-body self-gravitating systems, let\nus consider a very simple situation: the circular motion of a particle of mass m and velocity v at a\nradius r in a spherical mass distribution with a constant density \u03c10 :\n4\u03c0 3\nGmM (r)\nv2\n, M (r) =\n=\nr \u03c10 ,\n(2.1)\nr\nr2\n3\nwhere G is the gravitational constant and M (r) is the mass contained within the sphere of radius r.\nBy means of the orbital period T , we define the dynamical time of the system (see, e.g., p.57 of [1])\nas\nr\nT\n3\u03c0\n,\n(2.2)\n=\ntdyn =\n4\n16G\u03c10\nm\n\nwhich is recognized as the characteristic time scale of more general self-gravitating systems with mean\ndensity \u03c10 . A distribution of the self-gravitating system evolves with the time scale (2.2), so this\nquantity is called the dynamical time. As explained in the Appendix, the many-body self-gravitating\nsystem has another timescale, i.e. the relaxation time [18] (see also chapter 4 of [1]),\n0.1N\ntdyn\n(2.3)\nln N\nwhere N is the number of particles in the system. This time scale represents the relaxation processes\ndue to scattering by the gravitational interaction between each pair of particles.\nIn a usual system, we believe that a distribution of particles approaches the so-called thermal\nequilibrium state within the relaxation time (2.3). However, this is not necessarily the case for selfgravitating systems, since they have the peculiar property of a negative specific heat, which is explained\nthrough the following discussion. For the circular orbit obeying (2.1), the virial theorem is easily derived\nas\n2K + U = 0,\n(2.4)\ntrel \u223c\n\nwhere K = mv 2 /2 is the kinetic and U = \u2212GmM (r)/r the potential energy. In general, for selfgravitating many-body systems consisting of N particles, a virial relation identical to (2.4) holds\nbetween long-time-averaged values of the total kinetic and the total potential energy (see, e.g., chapter\n8.1 of [1]). Thus, the total energy E can be expressed as\nE = K + U = \u2212K.\n\n(2.5)\n\nIf we introduce a temperature to characterize the total kinetic energy as K = 3N kT /2, where k is the\nBoltzmann constant, then (2.5) tells us that the specific heat of a self-gravitating system is negative,\nsince\n3N k\ndE\n=\u2212\n< 0,\n(2.6)\nC\u2261\ndT\n2\nwhich suggests the existence of a thermodynamic instability proceeding with the relaxation timescale\n(2.3).\nFor a more precise discussion of the thermodynamic properties of self-gravitating systems, Antonov\n[5] and Lynden-Bell and Wood [6] considered a system confined within a spherical adiabatic wall of\nradius re . This means that the N particles in this system interact via Newtonian gravity and bounce\nelastically from the wall. In order to investigate the equilibrium states of the system, the Boltzmann\u2013\nGibbs entropy of the system,\nZ\nSBG = \u2212\n\nf ln f d6 \u03c4 ,\n\n(2.7)\n\n\fSelf-gravitating Stellar Systems and Non-extensive Thermostatistics\n\n3\n\nFig. 2.1. Energy-radius\u2013density contrast (left) and radius-temperature\u2013density contrast (right) relationships for the\nisothermal stellar system\n\nis introduced, where f (x, v) is the distribution function in phase-space. Here, the phase space measure\nis defined as\nd3 xd3 v\nd6 \u03c4 \u2261\n, h3 \u2261 (l0 v0 )3\n(2.8)\nh3\nwhere h3 denotes the phase-space element with unit length l0 and unit velocity v0 . Hereafter, we set\nthe Boltzmann constant to be unity, i.e. k = 1. Under the condition that the total mass M and the\nenergy E of the system are kept constant, we maximize the entropy SBG :\n\u03b4SBG \u2212 \u03b1\u03b4M \u2212 \u03b2\u03b4E = 0,\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are Lagrange multipliers. Through this procedure, the equation of state of the system\nturns to be isothermal [6]:\nZ\n1 2 d3 v\n\u03c1(x)\np(x) \u2261\nv f 3 =\n,\n3\nh\n\u03b2\nZ\nd3 v\n(2.10)\n\u03c1(x) \u2261 f 3\nh\nwhere p and \u03c1 are the pressure and density, respectively. The thermal equilibrium states of ordinary systems are homogeneous; i.e. they have uniform density. However, this is not the case for self-gravitating\nsystems. For the spherical systems we are discussing here, the magnitude of the density and pressure\nshould increase as the radius r decreases in order to support the system against its self-gravity. It is\nshown that a series of equilibrium states is well parameterized by the value of the density contrast\nD = \u03c1c /\u03c1e , where \u03c1c is the central density and \u03c1e = \u03c1(re ) is the density at the wall. In the next\nsection, we will present the procedures for calculating the equilibrium state in more general situations.\nIn Fig. 2.1 (left), we plot the dimensionless quantity \u03bb = \u2212re E/GM 2 as a function of the density\ncontrast D. Since the solid curve in this figure represents states which extremize the entropy, we note\nthat no equilibrium state is attained when the radius of the wall re is larger than the critical radius\nrc = 0.335\n\nGM 2\n,\n(\u2212E)\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhich corresponds to the state with the critical density contrast Dc = 709. Furthermore, it can be\nshown, from a turning-point analysis for a linear series of equilibria [6,19,20,21], that, along the curve\n\u03bb(D) derived from the condition \u03b4SBG = 0, all states with D > Dc are unstable. Also, the explicit\n\n\f4\n\nMasa-aki Sakagami et al.\n\nFig. 2.2. Specific heat as a function of the density contrast\nD = \u03c1c /\u03c1e for the isotropic stellar system.\n\nevaluation of the eigenmodes for the second variation of the entropy \u03b4 2 SBG leads to the same results\n[7,19]. We call this phenomenon, i.e. the absence of thermal equilibrium in self-gravitating systems\nwhen r > rc and/or D > Dc , the gravothermal catastrophe.\nHeuristically, this instability is explained by the presence of the negative specific heat as follows.\nIn a fully relaxed gravitating system with a sufficiently larger radius, the negative specific heat arises\nat the inner part of the system, where we have CV,inner < 0, while the specific heat at the outer part\nremains positive (CV,outer > 0), since one can safely neglect the effect of self-gravity. In this situation,\nif a tiny heat flow is momentarily supplied from the inner to the outer part, both the inner and outer\nparts get hotter after the readjustment of the system. Now imagine the case CV,outer > |CV,inner|. The\nouter part has so much thermal inertia that it cannot heat up as fast as the inner part, and thereby\nthe temperature difference between inner and outer parts increases. As a consequence, the heat flow\nnever stops, leading to a catastrophic temperature growth.\nFig. 2.1(right) plots the dimensionless inverse temperature \u03b7 \u2261 GM \u03b2/re with respect to the density\ncontrast. We can evaluate the specific heat at constant volume,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\u03bb\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\ndD re\ndE\ndE\n\u0013\nCV \u2261\n= \u2212\u03b2 2\n= M \u03b72 \u0012\n,\n(2.12)\nd\u03b7\ndT re\nd\u03b2 re\ndD re\nas shown in Fig.2.2.\nIn contrast to the naive discussion for (2.6) based on the virial theorem, the actual specific heat\n(2.12) changes sign many times. We observe that a self-gravitating system confined by a wall of smaller\nradius has a positive specific heat. The reason is as follows. It can be shown that the virial theorem\nfor a system surrounded by a boundary leads not to (2.4) but to\n2K + U = 3Pe V,\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere Pe is the pressure at the wall and V the volume of the system (see, e.g., eq.(29) of [14]). For\nthe case of a smaller radius, the surface energy dominates the gravitational energy of the bulk so that\nthe system behaves as a normal one; i.e. CV > 0. As the radius re increases, the gravitational energy\nbecomes significant. Eventually, the specific heat changes its sign, CV < 0 , when the value of the\ndensity contrast becomes D = 32.2, which corresponds to a peak of the \u03b7(D) curve (the left side of\nFig.2.1 ).\nAt the onset of the gravothermal catastrophe, Dc = 709, the specific heat vanishes, and CV > 0 in\nthe unstable segment of the \u03bb(D) curve, D > 709. This fact implicitly indicates a role of the negative\nspecific heat in existence of the thermodynamic instability in self-gravitating systems. Following the\n\n\fSelf-gravitating Stellar Systems and Non-extensive Thermostatistics\n\n5\n\nprevious heuristic argument, above the critical point (D > Dc = 709), the specific heat of the total\nsystem becomes positive (CV = CV,inner + CV,outer > 0) equivalently,\nCV,outer > \u2212 CV,inner > 0,\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhich means the outer normal part of the system has a larger heat capacity, so that it cannot catch\nup with the temperature increase of the inner part.\nSo far, we have discussed some interesting features of self-gravitating systems. Among these properties, the peculiarity of the system arising from the negative specific heat has been studied in terms\nof the Boltzmann\u2013Gibbs entropy (2.7). In the next section, this sort of the analysis will be extended to\nthat based on the non-additive entropy, i.e. the Tsallis entropy. However, before closing this section,\nwe briefly summarize the subsequent investigation of the gravothermal catastrophe.\nIn this paper we adopt the thermodynamic approach in terms of the entropy and/or the free energy\nin order to investigate instabilities of self-gravitating systems. Although this method has the advantage\nof simplicity, we cannot deal with dynamical aspects of the instability appearing within the relaxation\ntimescale (2.3). Typically, each particle (star) in a self-gravitating system has a long mean free path\ncompared with its system size. In other words, during its travel across the system, the the motion of a\nparticle is driven by the gravitational potential of the whole system and the particle experiences quite\na few two-body encounters, so that the relaxation time trel (2.3) is much longer than the dynamical one\ntdyn (2.2). This means that we cannot rely on the usual notion of local equilibrium, which is realized\nin cases with a short mean free path. Thus, the Fokker-Planck equation (see, e.g., chapter 8.3 of [1]),\nwhich can be derived from the expansion of a collision integral in the Boltzmann equation with respect\nto the momentum transfer due to a two-body collision, is a useful approach for studying the long-term\nevolution of a self-gravitating system. By means of the linearized Fokker-Planck equation, eigenvalues\nand eigenfunctions which describe the time evolution of perturbations around the thermal equilibrium\nhave been obtained [22].\nThe gas model in which a star (particle) in the self-gravitating many-body system is replaced by\na gas particle, is an alternative approach. Although the gas model loses some of the basic properties\nof a the self-gravitating many-body system, we note that it still shows the interesting aspects of\nthe gravothermal catastrophe. In this model, the local relaxation time is shorter than the dynamical\ntimescale. Thus, we can introduce the usual notions of local equilibrium and the local temperature,\nwhich make our analysis much easier than in the stellar system. The local specific heat is evaluated to\nshow that the condition (2.14) characterizes the onset of the gravothermal catastrophe [23]. The time\nevolution of a linear perturbation around the equilibrium gas with heat transfer has been investigated\nto show that the proposed mechanism for the instability based on the negative specific heat actually\nworks in self-gravitating gaseous systems [24].\n3 Analysis of gravothermal catastrophe based on Tsallis' generalized entropy\n3.1 Tsallis entropy and stellar polytrope\nHere we shall discuss a generalization of the analysis in previous section based on the Boltzmann\u2013Gibbs\nentropy (2.7) to the case of the Tsallis entropy. The details are given in the literature [14,15,16]. The\nthe energy and mass of a one- particle distribution f (x, v) are respectively expressed as\n\u001b\nZ \u001a\n1 2 1\nv + \u03a6(x) f (x, v) d6 \u03c4 ,\n(3.1)\nE =K +U =\n2\n2\nZ\nM=\nf (x, v) d6 \u03c4 ,\n(3.2)\nwhere the quantity \u03a6(x) is the gravitational potential given by\nZ\nf (x\u2032 , v \u2032 ) 6 \u2032\nd \u03c4 .\n(3.3)\n\u03a6(x) = \u2212G\n|x \u2212 x\u2032 |\nAs for generalization, the most crucial problem is the choice of the statistical average in nonextensive thermostatistics. Following a seminal paper [11], the analyses in a couple of our papers [14,\n\n\f6\n\nMasa-aki Sakagami et al.\n\n15] have been done by utilizing the old Tsallis formalism with the standard linear mean values(see also\n[25,26] for comparative works). On the other hand, a more sophisticated framework by means of the\nnormalized q-expectation values has recently been presented [27,28]. As several authors have advocated,\nthe analysis using normalized q-expectation values is thought to be essential, since the undesirable\ndivergences in some physical systems can be eliminated safely when introducing the normalized qexpectation values. Furthermore, non-uniqueness of the Boltzmann-Gibbs theory has been shown by\nusing normalized q-expectation values [29]. In this paper, we mainly report our investigation [16] based\non normalized q-expectation values. However, this does not imply that all the analyses with standard\nlinear means or un-normalized q-expectation values lose the physical significance. Actually, we observed\nsome differences between results based on two frameworks, which will be mentioned at the end of this\nsection.\nIn the new framework of Tsallis' non-extensive thermostatistics, all the macroscopic observables of\nthe quasi-equilibrium system can be characterized by the escort distribution, but the escort distribution\nitself is not thought to be fundamental. Rather, there exists a more fundamental probability function\np(x, v) that quantifies the phase-space structure. With the help of this function, the escort distribution\nis defined and the macroscopic observables are expressed as normalized q-expectation value as follows\n(see, e.g., [27,28]):\nescort distribution\n\n: Pq (x, v) = Z\n\nnormalized q-value : hO i iq =\n\nZ\n\n{p(x, v)}\n\nq\n\nd6 \u03c4 {p(x, v)}\n\nq\n\n,\n\nd6 \u03c4 Oi Pq (x, v) .\n\nBased on the fundamental probability p(x, v), the Tsallis entropy is given by\nZ\n1\nq\nd6 \u03c4 [{p(x, v)} \u2212 p(x, v)] .\nSq = \u2212\nq\u22121\n\nNote that the probability p(x, v) satisfies the normalization condition:\nZ\nd6 \u03c4 p(x, v) = 1.\n\n(3.4)\n\n(3.5)\n\n(3.6)\n\n(3.7)\n\nTo apply the above Tsallis formalism to the present problem without changing the definition of\nenergy and mass (3.1) and (3.2), we identify the one-particle distribution with the escort distribution\nPq , not the probability function p(x, v):\nZ\n{p(x, v)}q\n;\nNq = d6 \u03c4 {p(x, v)}q\n(3.8)\nf (x, v) = M\nNq\nso as to satisfy mass conservation (3.2). The definitions of the Tsallis entropy (3.6) and the escort\ndistribution (3.8) clearly show that the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy (2.7) is recovered in the limit q \u2192 1.\nNow, adopting the relation (3.8), let us seek the extremum-entropy state under the constraints (3.1)\nand (3.7). The variational problem is\n\u0014\n\u001aZ\n\u001b\n\u001aZ\n\u0013\n\u001b\u0015\n\u0012\n1 2 1\n\u03b4 Sq \u2212 \u03b1\nd6 \u03c4 p \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b2\nv + \u03a6 f \u2212E\n= 0,\n(3.9)\nd6 \u03c4\n2\n2\nwhere the variables \u03b1 and \u03b2 denote the Lagrange multipliers. The variation with respect to the probability p(x, v) gives the so-called stellar polytrope as the extremum-entropy state [16] (see also p.223\nof [1]):\n\u0014\n\u0015q/(1\u2212q)\n1 2\n{p(x, v)}q\n= A \u03a60 \u2212 v \u2212 \u03a6(x)\nf (x, v) = M\n,\n(3.10)\nNq\n2\nwhere we define the constants A and \u03a60 as\n\u001a\n\u001bq/(1\u2212q)\nq(1 \u2212 q) \u03b2M\nM\n,\nA=\nNq\n\u03b1(1 \u2212 q) + 1 Nq\n\n\u03a60 =\n\nNq\n+ < \u03b5 >,\n\u03b2M (1 \u2212 q)\n\n(3.11)\n\n\fSelf-gravitating Stellar Systems and Non-extensive Thermostatistics\n\n7\n\nwith the quantity < \u03b5 > being\n< \u03b5 >=\n\n1\nM\n\nZ\n\nd6 \u03c4\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n1 2\nv + \u03a6 f.\n2\n\n(3.12)\n\nBy means of the distribution function (3.10), we evaluate the density \u03c1(r) and the isotropic pressure\nP (r) at the radius r = |x| as\nZ 3\nd v\n\u03c1(r) \u2261\nf (x, v),\nh3\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\n3\nA\n1\n= 4 2\u03c0 B\n[\u03a60 \u2212 \u03a6(r)]1/(1\u2212q)+1/2\n(3.13)\n,\n2 1 \u2212 q h3\nand\nd3 v 1 2\nv f (x, v),\nh3 3\n\u221a\n\u0013\n\u0012\n8 2\u03c0\nA\n1\n5\n=\n[\u03a60 \u2212 \u03a6(r)]1/(1\u2212q)+3/2 .\nB\n,\n3\n2 1 \u2212 q h3\n\nP (r) \u2261\n\nZ\n\n(3.14)\n\nHere, the function B(a, b) denotes the beta function. These two equations lead to the polytropic relation\nP (r) = Kn \u03c11+1/n (r),\n\n(3.15)\n\nwith the polytrope index n related to the parameter q by\nn=\n\n1\n1\n+ .\n1\u2212q\n2\n\n(3.16)\n\nThe explicit form of the dimensional constant Kn is given in [16]. We note that the isothermal equation\nof state (2.10) discussed in the previous section arises in the limit n \u2192 \u221e (q \u2192 1) as expected.\nIn terms of Kn and \u03c1, the one-particle distribution can be rewritten as\n1\n\u03c1 h3\nf (x, v) = \u221a\n4 2\u03c0 B(3/2, n \u2212 1/2) {(n + 1) Kn \u03c11/n }3/2\n\u001bn\u22123/2\n\u001a\nv 2 /2\n,\n\u00d7 1\u2212\n(n + 1) Kn \u03c11/n\n\n(3.17)\n\nwhich agrees with the result based on the old Tsallis formalism. That is to say, the equilibrium distribution (3.17) turns out to be invariant irrespective of the choice of the statistical averages.\nWe note that the equilibrium distribution (3.10) with (3.11) contains the new quantities Nq and\n< \u03b5 >, which implicitly depend on the distribution function itself. In marked contrast to the result\nin the old Tsallis formalism, this fact gives rise to non-trivial thermodynamic relations as follows. By\nusing the definitions of density and pressure (3.13) and (3.14), the quantity < \u03b5 > becomes\n\u001a Z\n\u001b\nZ\n3\n1\n<\u03b5>=\nd3 x P (x) + d3 x \u03c1(x) \u03a6(x)\nM 2\n\u001a Z\n\u001b\nZ\n1\n3\n=\nd3 x P (x) \u2212 d3 x \u03c1(x) [\u03a60 \u2212 \u03a6(x)] + \u03a60 .\nM 2\nFurthermore, by using the relation \u03a60 \u2212 \u03a6(x) = (n + 1)(P/\u03c1) from (3.13) and (3.14) and substituting\nthe equation (3.11) into the above expression, the quantity < \u03b5 > is canceled and the equation reduces\nto\nZ\nNq\n=\nd3 x P (x).\n(3.18)\n\u03b2\nAs for Nq , the normalization condition (3.7) gives us its actual expression [16].\n\n\f8\n\nMasa-aki Sakagami et al.\n\n3.2 Gravothermal catastrophe in the stellar polytropic system\nWe will specifically focus on the spherically symmetric case with the polytrope index n > 3/2 (q > 0),\nin which the equilibrium distribution is at least dynamically stable (see chapter 5 of [1]). In this case,\nthe stellar equilibrium distribution can be characterized by the so-called Emden solutions (see, e.g.,\n[30,31]) and all the physical quantities are expressed in terms of the homology invariant variables\n(u, v), which are subsequently used in later analysis.\nWe note that the one-particle distribution function (3.10) does not yet completely specify the\nequilibrium configuration, due to the presence of the gravitational potential, which implicitly depends\non the distribution function itself. Hence, we need to specify the gravitational potential or density\nprofile. From the gravitational potential (3.3), we obtain the Poisson equation\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1 d\n2 d\u03a6(r)\nr\n= 4\u03c0G\u03c1(r).\n(3.19)\nr2 dr\ndr\nBy combining the above equation with (3.13), we obtain the ordinary differential equation for \u03a6.\nAlternatively, a set of equations which represent the hydrostatic equilibrium are derived by using\n(3.19), (3.13), and (3.14):\ndP (r)\nGm(r)\n\u03c1(r),\n(3.20)\n= \u2212\ndr\nr2\ndm(r)\n= 4\u03c0\u03c1(r) r2 .\n(3.21)\ndr\nThe quantity m(r) denotes the mass evaluated at the radius r inside the wall. Denoting the central\ndensity and pressure by \u03c1c and Pc , we then introduce the dimensionless quantities:\n\u001b1/2\n\u001a\n(n + 1)Pc\nn\n\u03be,\n(3.22)\n\u03c1 = \u03c1c [\u03b8(\u03be)] , r =\n4\u03c0G\u03c12c\nwhich yields the ordinary differential equation\n2\n\u03b8\u2032\u2032 + \u03b8\u2032 + \u03b8n = 0,\n\u03be\n\n(3.23)\n\nwhere the prime denotes the derivative with respect to \u03be. The quantities \u03c1c and Pc in (3.22) are the\ndensity and the pressure at r = 0, respectively. To obtain the physically relevant solution of (3.23), we\nuse the boundary condition\n\u03b8(0) = 1, \u03b8\u2032 (0) = 0.\n(3.24)\nA family of solutions satisfying (3.24) is referred to as the Emden solution, which is well-known in the\nsubject of stellar structure (see, e.g., chapter IV of ref.[30]). To characterize the equilibrium properties\nof Emden solutions, it is convenient to introduce the following set of variables, referred to as homology\ninvariants [30,31]:\nu\u2261\n\n4\u03c0r3 \u03c1(r)\n\u03be\u03b8n\nd ln m(r)\n=\n=\u2212 \u2032 ,\nd ln r\nm(r)\n\u03b8\n\nv\u2261\u2212\n\nd ln P (r)\n\u03c1(r) Gm(r)\n\u03be\u03b8\u2032\n=\n= \u2212(n + 1)\n,\nd ln r\nP (r)\nr\n\u03b8\n\n(3.25)\n(3.26)\n\nwhich reduce the degree of (3.23) from two to one. Recall that we are investigating the thermodynamic\nproperties of a self-gravitating system within a wall of radius re . We can evaluate the total energy of\nthe confined stellar system in terms of the pressure Pe , the density \u03c1e at the boundary re , and the\ntotal mass M :\nZ re\nZ\nGm(r) dm\n3 re\n2\ndt\ndr 4\u03c0r P (r) \u2212\nE =K +U =\n2 0\nr\ndr\n0\n\u0014 \u001a\n\u001b\n\u0015\n2\n1\n3 GM\nM Pe\n3\n=\u2212\n\u2212 (n + 1)\n+ (n \u2212 2) 4\u03c0 re Pe ,\nn\u22125 2\nre\n\u03c1e\n\n\fSelf-gravitating Stellar Systems and Non-extensive Thermostatistics\n\n9\n\nFig.\n3.1.\nEnergy-radiusdensity contrast relationship\nfor the stellar polytropes with\nvarious indices.\n\nby which the dimensionless quantity \u03bb can be expressed as a function of the homology invariants at\nthe wall [14,15,16] :\n\u0014 \u001a\n\u001b\n\u0015\nn+1\n3\nue\n1\nEre\n1\u2212\n+ (n \u2212 2)\n.\n(3.27)\n=\u2212\n\u03bb\u2261\u2212\nGM 2\nn\u22125 2\nve\nve\nAs was already shown in section 2 for the isothermal case, the above dimensionless quantity \u03bb has\nan important role for the analysis of the gravothermal catastrophe. Figure 3.1 shows \u03bb as a function\nof the ratio of the central density to that at the boundary, \u03c1c /\u03c1e . We notice that the \u03bb-curves are\nbounded from above and have peaks in the case of n > 5 (right panel). On the other hand, the curves\nfor n \u2264 5 monotonically increase (left panel). It follows that the stellar polytrope within an adiabatic\nwall exhibits the gravothermal instability in the case of a polytropic index n > 5. Similarly to the\nisothermal case, the evaluation of eigenvalues for the second variation of the Tsallis entropy \u03b4 2 Sq gives\nthe same results as the above turning point analysis in terms of the \u03bb-curve [14,15,16].\n\n3.3 Thermodynamic instability arising from the negative specific heat\nAs discussed in the isothermal case in the previous section, thermodynamic instability in stellar systems\nis intimately related to the presence of a negative specific heat [6,32]. The evaluation of the specific\nheat is thus necessary for clarifying the thermodynamic properties. In this regard, the identification\nof the temperature in the stellar system in the polytropic case is the most essential task.\nIn the new framework of Tsallis' non-extensive thermostatistics, the physically plausible thermodynamic temperature Tphys can be defined from the zero-th law of thermodynamics [33,34,35]. The\nthermodynamic temperature in a non-extensive system differs from the usual one, i.e., the inverse of\nthe Lagrange multiplier \u03b2. The pseudo-additivity of the Tsallis entropy and the transitivity of thermal\nequilibria suggests\nTphys = [1 + (1 \u2212 q) Sq ] \u03b2 \u22121 .\n(3.28)\nHere, the relation (3.28) should be carefully applied to the present case, since the verification of zeroth thermodynamic law is very difficult in a stellar equilibrium system with long-range interactions.\nFurthermore, even using the new formalism, the energy E remains non-extensive due to the selfreferential form of the potential energy (see (3.1) and (3.3)). However, the consistency of the physical\ntemperature given by (3.28) can be shown by an alternative argument [15,16] for the self-gravitating\nstellar system, where the modified Clausius relation [33,34,35]\ndSq =\nplays a significant role.\n\n1\n{1 + (1 \u2212 q) Sq } d\u2032 Q.\nTphys\n\n\f10\n\nMasa-aki Sakagami et al.\n\nFig. 3.2.

In the isothermal case, the onset of the thermodynamic instability is characterized by the condition (2.14). Figure\n3.3 shows that the thermodynamic argument based on the negative specific heat for the gravothermal catastrophe can be extended to the case of the stellar polytrope, i.e. the equilibrium of the\nself-gravitating system described by the extremum of the Tsallis entropy.\nIn Fig. 3.3, we depict the density profiles with respect to the dimensionless radius \u03be (3.22). Clearly,\nprofiles with index n < 5 rapidly fall off and they abruptly terminate at finite radius(left panel), while\nthe n \u2265 5 cases infinitely continue to extend over the outer radius(right panel). It follows that stellar\npolytropic systems with index n \u2265 5 are able to possess a sufficient amount of the outer normal part\nto realize the gravothermal catastrophe.\n\n\fSelf-gravitating Stellar Systems and Non-extensive Thermostatistics\n\n11\n\nFig. 3.3. Density profiles of\nthe stellar polytropes for n < 5\n(left) and n \u2265 5 (right).\n\nBefore closing this section, we mention differences between the old and new Tsallis formalisms.\nFirst, the relationship between the polytrope index n and theTsallis parameter q in (3.16) differs from\nthe one obtained previously, but is related to it through the duality transformation, q \u2194 1/q (see (14)\nin [14] or (12) in [15]). This property was first addressed in [27] in a more general context, together with\nchanges to the Lagrangian multiplier \u03b2. The duality relation implies that all of the thermodynamic\nproperties in the new formalism can also be translated into those obtained in the old formalism.\nSecondly , in previous studies [15] based on the standard linear means, the radius-mass-temperature\nrelation and the specific heat seriously depend on the dimensional parameter for the phase element h\n(2.8). By contrast, in the present case [16], the radius-mass-temperature relation was derived from the\nnon-trivial relation (3.18), in which no such h-dependence appears. The resultant specific heat is also\nfree from this dependence, which is a natural outcome of the new framework using the normalized qexpectation values. Therefore, it seems likely that the new formalism provides a better characterization\nfor non-extensive quasi-equilibrium systems.\n4 Reality of the stellar polytrope as a quasi-equilibrium state\nSo far, we have discussed the extension of the thermodynamic analysis to the stellar polytrope which\nis obtained by applying the variational procedure to the Tsallis entropy for the stellar self-gravitating\nsystem. It has been shown that thermodynamic quantities such as the specific heat are useful for studying the emergence of the gravothermal catastrophe in the stellar polytrope. In Fig. 4.1 we summarize\nour results. The stellar polytrope confined by an adiabatic wall is shown to be thermodynamically\nstable when the polytrope index n < 5. In other words, if n > 5, a stable equilibrium state ceases\nto exist for a sufficiently large density contrast D > Dcrit , where the critical value Dcrit given by a\nfunction of n is determined from the second variation of the entropy around the extremum state of\nthe Tsallis entropy, \u03b4 2 Sq = 0[14,16]. The dotted line in Fig.4.1 represents the critical value Dcrit for\neach polytrope index, which indicates that the stellar polytrope at low density contrast D < Dcrit is\nexpected to remain stable.\nThe above arguments indicate that, similar to the isothermal state, the stellar polytropic distribution can also be regarded as an equilibrium state, since it is described by the extremal state of the\nTsallis entropy. However, the one-particle distribution function of the stellar polytrope (3.17) clearly\nshows that the velocity dispersion,\nZ 3\nd v 2\n1\nv f (x, v),\n(4.1)\n\u03c3(r) \u221d\n\u03c1(r)\nh3\ndepends on the radius r. Only in the isothermal case, n \u2192 \u221e, is \u03c3 spatially constant. Thus, it\nis expected that a gradient of the velocity dispersion is relaxed within the time scale due to twobody collisions (2.3). This means that the stellar polytrope is no longer the equilibrium but a quasi-\n\n\f12\n\nMasa-aki Sakagami et al.\n\nB2\n\nA\nB1\n\nC1\nC2\nFig. 4.1.

The thick arrows denote the evolutionary tracks in each simulation run (see Sec.4).\n\nequilibrium state. In this section, we report the results of N -body simulations [17] which were carried\nout to investigate how the stellar polytrope actually evolves.\nThe N -body experiment considered here is the same as that investigated in classic papers ([5,6];\nsee also [36]). That is, we confine the N particles interacting via Newtonian gravity in a spherical\nadiabatic wall, which reverses the radial components of the velocity if the particles reach the wall.\nWithout loss of generality, we set the units as G = M = re = 1. Note that the typical time scales\nappearing in this system are the dynamical time tdyn (2.2) and the global relaxation time driven by\nthe two-body encounter, trel (2.3), which are basically scaled as tdyn \u223c 1 and trel \u223c 0.1N/ ln N in\nour units. Table 4.1 summarizes the five simulation runs. Here, in addition to the stellar polytropic\ninitial state, we also consider the non-stellar polytropic state of the Hernquist model [37], which was\noriginally introduced to account for the empirical law of observed elliptical galaxies[1].\nAs was expected, the numerical simulations reveal that the stellar polytropic distribution gradually\nchanges with time, on the time scale of two-body relaxation (2.3). Furthermore, focusing on the\nevolutionary sequence, we found that the transient state starting from the initial stellar polytrope can\nbe remarkably characterized by a sequence of stellar polytropes (run A, B1, and B2). This is even true\nin the case starting from the Hernquist model (run C1).\nLet us show representative results taken from run A (Fig.4.2). Figure 4.2(a) plots snapshots of\nthe density profile \u03c1(r), while Fig.4.2(b) represents the distribution function f (\u03b5) as a function of the\nspecific energy \u03b5 = 21 v 2 + \u03a6(x). Note, for illustrative purpose, that each output result is artificially\nshifted to the two digits below. Only the final output with T = 400 represents the correct scales.\nIn each figure, solid lines mean the initial stellar polytrope with n = 3 and the other lines indicate\nTable 4.1.

Note that the number\nof fitting parameters just dexreases to one, i.e. the polytrope index, since the total energy is wellconserved in the present situation. Fig.4.2 shows that while the system gradually deviates from the\ninitial polytropic state, the transient state still follows a sequence of stellar polytropes. The fitting\nresults are remarkably good until the time exceeds T \u2243 400, corresponding to 15 trel. After that, the\nsystem enters the gravothermally unstable regime and finally undergoes the core collapse.\nNow, focus on the evolutionary track in each simulation run summarized in the energy-radius-density\ncontrast plane (Fig.4.1), where the filled circle represents the initial stellar polytrope. Interestingly, the\ndensity contrast of the transient state in run A initially decreases, but it eventually turns to increase.\nThe turning point roughly corresponds to the stellar polytrope with index n \u223c 5 \u2212 6. Note, however,\nthat the time evolution of the polytrope index itself is a monotonically increasing function of time [17].\nThis is indeed true for the other cases, indicating the Boltzmann H-theorem that any self-gravitating\nsystem tends to approach the isothermal state. A typical example is run C2, which finally reaches\nthe stable isothermal state. However, as already shown in run A, not all the systems can reach the\nisothermal state. Fig.4.1 indicates that no isothermal state is possible for a fixed value \u03bb > 0.335[5,6],\nwhich can be derived from the peak value of the trajectory. Further, stable stellar polytropes cease to\nexist at a high density contrast, D > Dcrit . In fact, our simulations starting from the stellar polytropes\nfinally underwent core collapse due to the gravothermal catastrophe (runs A, B1, and B2). Though\nit might not be rigorously correct, the predicted value Dcrit provides a crude approximation to the\nboundary between stability and instability.\nFig.4.3 plots snapshots of the distribution function taken from the other runs. The initial density\ncontrast in run B1 (Fig.4.3(a)) is relatively low (D = 110) and therefore the system slowly evolves\nby following a sequence of stellar polytropes. After T = 2000 \u223c 74 trel , the system begins to deviate\nfrom the stable equilibrium sequence, leading to core collapse. Another noticeable case is run C1\n(Fig.4.3(b)). The Hernquist model as the initial distribution of run C has a cuspy density profile,\n\u03c1(r) \u221d 1/r/(r + a)3 , which behaves as \u03c1 \u221d r\u22121 at the inner part [37]. The resultant distribution\nfunction f (\u03b5) shows singular behavior at the negative energy region, which cannot be described by\nthe power-law distribution. Soon after, however, gravothermal expansion[36] takes place and a flatter\ncore is eventually formed. Then the system settles into a sequence of stellar polytropes and can be\napproximately described by the stellar polytrope with index n = 20 for a long time. Thus the stellar\npolytrope can be regarded as a quasi-attractor and a quasi-equilibrium state.\n\n\f14\n\nMasa-aki Sakagami et al.\n\n-4\n\n-4\n\n-8\n\n-8\n\n-12\n\n-12\n\nFig. 4.3. Evolution of the one-particle distribution function in other models: (a) run B1; (b) run C1\n\n5 Conclusion and Discussion\nIn this paper, we discussed issues arising from the Tsallis entropy for the thermodynamic properties of\nstellar self-gravitating systems, with a particular emphasis on the standard framework using normalized\nq-expectation values. It turns out that the new extremum-entropy state essentially remains unchanged\nfrom previous studies and is characterized by the stellar polytrope, although the distribution function\nshows several distinct properties. By considering these facts carefully, the thermodynamic temperature\nof the extremum state was identified through the modified Clausius relation and the specific heat was\nevaluated explicitly. A detailed analysis of the behavior of specific heat finally led to the conclusion\nthat the onset of gravothermal instability remains unchanged with respect to choice of the statistical\naverage for a system confined by an adiabatic wall (micro-canonical case). As for a system surrounded\nby a thermal wall (canonical case), although the analysis has been skipped in this article, the stability\nof the system drastically depends on the choice of the statistical average [15,16]. The existence of these\nthermodynamic instabilities can also be deduced rigorously from the variation of the entropy and free\nenergy [14,15,16]. As a result, above certain critical values of \u03bb or D, the thermodynamic instability\nappears at n > 5 for a system confined by an adiabatic wall.\nWe performed a set of numerical simulations of long-term stellar dynamical evolution away from\nthe isothermal state and found that the transient state of a system confined by an adiabatic wall can\nbe remarkably fitted by a sequence of stellar polytropes. This is even true for the case in which the\nouter boundary in removed [17]. Therefore, the stellar polytropic distribution can be a quasi-attractor\nand a quasi-equilibrium state of a self-gravitating system.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to P.H.

For a more\nprecise derivation, consult [1,18]. In the kinetic theory, a time scale of relaxation due to two-body\ncollisions is given by\n1\n,\n(A.1)\ntrel \u223c\n\u03c3nv\n\n\fSelf-gravitating Stellar Systems and Non-extensive Thermostatistics\n\n15\n\nwhere n is the mean number density and v the average relative velocity of particles. In order to evaluate\ntheamplitude of a two-body collision by the mutual gravitational force, we introduce the gravitational\nradius rg as follows,\nGm\nGm2\n\u2212\u2192\nrg \u223c 2 .\n(A.2)\nmv 2 \u223c\nrg\nv\nIf the impact parameter of the collision between two particles of identical mass m becomes smaller\nthan the gravitational radius, i.e. b < rg , orbits of particles are significantly changed by the close\nencounter. It follows that the cross section of a two-body collision is given by\n\u03c3 \u223c 4\u03c0rg2 .\n(A.3)\n3\nBy substituting this estimate and n \u223c N/R into (A.1), we obtain\nv 3 R3\ntrel \u223c\n,\n(A.4)\n4\u03c0 G2 m2 N ln (R/rg )\nwhere R and N are the system size and the number of particles, respectively. In the above expression\n(A.4), we have included the so\u2013called Coulomb logarithm term, ln(R/rg ), which appears due to the\nlong-range nature of the interaction [1] and is well-known in plasma theory. By taking its ratio to the\ndynamical time tdyn \u223c R/v, we obtain\nN\ntdyn ,\n(A.5)\ntrel \u223c\n4\u03c0 ln N\nwhere the average velocity is estimated as v 2 \u223c GN m/R from the virial theorem (2.4).\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\nJ.
