The fundamental starting point of this theory is\nthe existence of long-lived fermionic quasiparticles whose\neffective interactions lead only to non diffractive scattering in the zero temperature limit and near to the Fermi\nsurface. In recent years, however, there has been a proliferation of materials that display behaviour not easily understood within the Fermi liquid picture. These so called\n'non-Fermi liquids' (NFLs) encompass a variety of systems. Examples include the normal state of the high-Tc\ncuprates [1], one-dimensional Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids [2, 3], paramagnetic metals near a first order phase\ntransitions [4] and Kondo lattice systems [5].\nA particularly rich variety of NFL behaviour is exhibited by materials in which a magnetic phase transition is\nobserved at low temperatures (see for instance reference\n[6]). Tuning the transition to T \u2192 0 K (a quantum critical point) yields temperature dependences of physical\nproperties that differ from the power laws predicted by\nFermi liquid theory. Early attempts to explain this NFL\nbehaviour were based on the effects of strongly enhanced\nlow-frequency, long-wavelength spin fluctuations [7\u201311]\n(often called the self-consistent renormalisation or SCR\ntheory). In the specific case of three-dimensional materials near a ferromagnetic quantum critical point these\napproaches suggest characteristic transport and thermodynamic properties. For instance the electrical resistivity\nis anticipated to vary as T 5/3 [12], instead of the usual T 2\nbehaviour expected in a Fermi liquid, and the electronic\n\nheat capacity diverges logarithmically at low temperatures, instead of the Fermi liquid linear in temperature\nvariation.\nThese non-Fermi liquid temperature dependences are\na consequence of an underlying quasiparticle scattering\nrate, \u03c4 \u22121 , which varies linearly with the excitation energy\nE of a quasiparticle near the Fermi level. This is characteristic not of a Fermi liquid, for which \u03c4 \u22121 varies as E 2 ,\nbut of a marginal Fermi liquid. The study of the marginal\nFermi liquid (MFL) state is compelling, as it represents\nthe weakest breakdown of the quasiparticle picture, and\nthus could prove to be a gateway to understanding more\nexotic departures from Fermi liquid theory.\nIn this paper we examine in more detail the transport\nof heat and charge in ZrZn2 reported in a previous work\n[13], which is a metal close to a 3D ferromagnetic critical point. We calculate the temperature dependencies of\ntransport properties using SCR theory, and show them\nto be both qualitatively and semi-quantitatively in agreement with our data. In particular we pay close attention\nto the difference between thermal and electrical resistivities, following the analytical framework of Paglione et al.\n[14] for clean magnetic metals. We then compare these\nresults with new measurements of the electronic specific\nheat, which we argue lends further support to the validity\nof the SCR model in this material.\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\n\nThe intermetallic compound ZrZn2 crystallizes in the\nC15 cubic Laves structure, and is the archetypal d-band\nitinerant electron ferromagnet [15]. Improved sample\nquality as well as reports of the possible co-existence of\n\n\f2\nferromagnetism and superconductivity [16, 17] have stimulated renewed interest in this compound in recent years.\nThe highest quality samples of ZrZn2 order ferromagnetically at Tc = 28.5 K, and magnetization measurements\nreveal a small moment of 0.17 \u03bcB /Zr atom in the lowtemperature, low-magnetic field limit which is well below\nthe Curie-Weiss moment \u03bceff = 1.9 \u03bcB /Zr atom [18].\nThe ferromagnetic transition is suppressed to zero with\nthe application of only 20 kbar of hydrostatic pressure\n[13, 18], suggesting that ZrZn2 at ambient pressure is\nclose to a ferromagnetic quantum critical point. This\nidea is supported by de Haas-van Alphen studies which\nshow significantly enhanced cyclotron effective masses, as\nexpected in the critical regime [19], and that longitudinal\nfluctuations of the local magnetisation are important[20].\nInelastic neutron scattering studies support the applicability of an SCR model, since the generalised magnetic\nsusceptibility (\u03c7q,\u03c9 ) at low wavevector, q, and low frequency, \u03c9, has structure characteristic of overdamped\ndiffusive modes with a strongly dispersive relaxation rate\n[21].\nIn our experiments we measured four single crystal\nsamples with varying levels of impurities [22, 23]. The\nsamples were thin and platelet shaped with typical dimensions of 2 mm \u00d7 0.5 mm \u00d7 0.2 mm. We label\neach crystal by its residual resistivity \u03c10 and residual resistivity ratio (RRR) defined as \u03c1300K /\u03c10 . These were\nmeasured to be \u03c10 = 0.31 \u03bc\u03a9cm (RRR = 210), \u03c10 =\n0.97 \u03bc\u03a9cm (RRR = 67), \u03c10 = 2.3 \u03bc\u03a9cm (RRR = 29)\nand \u03c10 = 6.4 \u03bc\u03a9cm (RRR = 11) and were selected to\ncover a range of impurity concentrations.\nEach sample was spark cut into a convenient geometry,\nthen electropolished to remove a surface layer of approximately 5 \u03bcm in depth. This step was taken to avoid surface inclusions of superconducting material, shown previously to arise from the spark cutting procedure [17].\nContacts were made in a four wire geometry using a low\npower micro-spot-welding technique [24], yielding contact resistances that were measured to be 5 m\u03a9 or less\nat low temperatures.\nResistivity measurements were performed using a standard 4-terminal low-frequency AC technique in a 3 He\ncryostat and in an adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerator, with low-noise transformers to enhance the signal-tonoise level. Measurements were performed on the samples with several different excitation currents between 0.1\nand 1mA and several different heating rates to ensure reproducibility.\nThermal conductivity was measured with a twothermometer, one-heater, steady-state technique down to\nT =0.8 K on a 3 He system. The reliability of our setup\nwas tested by measuring both heat and charge transport\nin silver wire, obtaining the Wiedemann-Franz law at low\ntemperatures to within 2%. Measurements were checked\nusing different models of Cernox thermometers and different sizes of temperature gradient in order to ensure\nreliability.\nThe heat capacity measurements between 0.3 and\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) Main: Resistivity for the four samples\nof ZrZn2 with plotted versus T 5/3 .

We observe a non-Fermi liquid\ntemperature dependence of the form \u03c1(T ) = \u03c10 + AT 5/3\nbetween 300 mK and approximately 15 K (or higher in\nthe cleanest samples), in agreement with that observed\nin recent work [22, 25]. No evidence of superconductivity was observed down to 300mK in any of our crystals,\npresumably due to our chemical treatment of the surface.\nThe excellent fit to a pure T 5/3 power law indicates\nthat the scattering of electrons by spin fluctuations is\nmuch larger than the scattering by phonons across a\nwide temperature range. Significant phonon scattering\nwould normally be expected to produce a characteristic T 5 temperature dependence in the resistivity at low\ntemperatures, crossing over to a T -linear dependence at\nhigher temperatures. Neutron scattering measurements\n\n\f3\nZrZn2 samples. In a metallic material such as ZrZn2 , the\nthermal conductivity has contributions from both electrons (\u03bael ) and phonons (\u03baph ). In the ferromagnetic state\nat very low temperatures T << TC , we might also expect a contribution from magnons (\u03bamag ). A careful consideration of the relative magnitudes of each of these is\nnecessary to evaluate the suitability of the MFL model\nin describing ZrZn2 .\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) Electrical resistivity of ZrZn2 in a\nmagnetic field. Main panel: \u03c1 vs. T for the sample with\n\u03c10 =0.97 \u03bc\u03a9cm in \u03bc0 H = 0 and \u03bc0 H = 9 T. Upper left inset:\n\u03bc0 H =9 T data, plotted vs. T 2 . Bottom right inset: \u03bc0 H =\n0 T data, plotted vs. T 5/3 . The solid lines in both insets are\nfits to the data below 15 K.\n\non ZrZn2 are consistent with this observation - the observed scattering intensities are up to two orders of magnitude larger than what could be expected from phonons\nalone at low temperatures [21]. A similar conclusion was\nreached in transport studies of the cubic Laves-phase\ncompounds RCo2 (R=Sc,Y,Lu) by Gratz and coworkers\n[26, 27]. In these compounds, which lie near a ferromagnetic instability and play host to spin fluctuations, it was\nconcluded that the contribution to \u03c1 from phonon scattering was negligible below 30 K.\nFigure 2 shows how the T 5/3 state is affected by the\napplication of a magnetic field. With \u03bc0 H = 9 T, the\nresistivity recovers a characteristic Fermi liquid-like T 2\ndependence, which may be understood to arise due to the\nsuppression or gapping of the fluctuations in a magnetic\nfield, as suggested by measurements of the electronic specific heat [28]. The overall change in the resistivity with\ntemperature is similarly suppressed with field, supporting this interpretation.\nIn can also be seen from Figure 2 that the magnetoresistance of the sample is strongly temperature dependent,\nas observed previously in polycrystalline samples [29]. At\nlow temperatures, the effect is positive, as expected in an\nordinary metal. Above T \u223c 22 K however the magnetoresistance becomes negative, suggesting that the decrease\nin resistivity due to the stiffening of spin fluctuations\noutweighs the increase in resistivity due to orbital magnetoresistance. The recovery of T 2 power law at high\nfields helps rule out disorder scattering as the origin of\nthe T 5/3 power law in \u03bc0 H = 0, since this process would\nhave little field dependence.\nFigure 3 shows the thermal conductivity of the three\n\nThe thermal current due to coherent, propagating,\nmagnetic modes (magnons) can be difficult to distinguish from other contributions to \u03ba. Such modes are\nnot the overdamped, diffusive spin excitations mentioned\npreviously, but coherent spin waves existing at very low\nq that may become populated in the low temperature\nregime. The contribution to thermal transport from such\nmodes can be considerable, as was demonstrated in the\nantiferromagnetic insulator Nd2 CuO4 [30, 31]. However,\nin magnetic metals \u03bamag is limited by scattering from\ncharge carriers [32] which can greatly limit the conductivity. We would expect \u03bamag to be particularly small in\nZrZn2 due to its very small ordered moment which limits the phase space available for propagating magnons\nto q < qsw (qsw = k\u2191 \u2212 k\u2193 \u221d M , where k\u2191 and k\u2193 are\nthe radii of the majority and minority spin sheets of the\nFermi surface respectively and M is the magnetisation).\nWe thus ignore the contribution from \u03bamag .\nBetween the remaining two terms, \u03bael and \u03baph , we argue that by far the largest contribution to thermal conductivity at low temperatures is the electronic term, as\nmight be expected in metals with exceptionally low \u03c10 .\nFrom Figure 3, we see that increasing the residual resistivity from 0.31 \u03bc\u03a9cm to 6.4 \u03bc\u03a9cm drastically reduces\nthe overall thermal conductivity of the sample, and the\ncharacteristic peak seen in the cleanest sample at T \u223c\n10 K is rapidly suppressed. Since the \u03bael is unlikely to\nchange much between these two samples, we can infer\nthat the reduction in peak height is essentially due to\nan increase in elastic scattering of electrons from impurities. Studies of controlled levels of impurities doped into\nconventional ferromagnetic metals have shown a similar\ntrend [33].\nThe inset of Figure 3 shows an expanded view of the\nregion near the peak observed in our cleanest sample. A\nsimple linear extrapolation above and below the kink in\nthe data meets at T \u223c 28 K, a reasonable estimate for\nthe onset temperature of the peak. This is coincident\nwith the Curie temperature TC = 28.5 K [18], and we\nthus attribute the peak in \u03ba to the increase in electronic\nmean free path as the sample enters the ferromagnetically\nordered state and spin fluctuation scattering is reduced.\nA more detailed treatment of the relative magnitudes\nof \u03bael and \u03baph lends quantitative support to our argument. We can estimate \u03baph by comparing data from samples with different levels of impurities as follows.

When considering the transport of both\nheat and charge by electrons, we must bear in mind that\nscattering events may affect thermal and electrical currents in different ways. We thus define the difference\nbetween the thermal resistivity (w) and the electrical resistivity (\u03c1) as \u03b4, which contains information about scattering processes:\n\n\u03b4 =w\u2212\u03c1=\n\nL0 T\n\u2212 \u03c1.\n\u03bael\n\n(2)\n\nThe difference between the effect of scattering on the\ncharge and heat current is that while charge current is\nonly degraded due to the quasiparticle being deflected\nthrough a scattering angle \u03b8, the heat current is also degraded by any loss of energy (~\u03c9) of the quasiparticle\n[34, 35]. The difference between electrical and thermal\nresistivities can thus reveal information about the nature\nof inelastic scattering processes, as pointed out by Kaiser\nfor the case of localized magnetic impurities in metallic\nalloys [35] and recently used to investigate antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the clean magnetic metal CeRhIn5\n[14]. In the case of a ferromagnetic metal such as ZrZn2 ,\nsuch inelastic processes are attributed principally to scattering from spin fluctuations.\n\nFIG. 4: The estimated phonon contribution to the total thermal conductivity using the analytical method described in the\ntext. The dashed line represents a fit to \u03baph \u221d T 2 . The inset shows the estimated phonon contribution compared to the\ntotal conductivity measured in the cleanest sample.\n\nWe may now arrive at an estimate for the phonon conductivity \u03baph . At low temperatures, in keeping with\nMatthiessen's rule, we assume that the amount of impurities in a given sample in the dilute limit would not\nconsiderably alter \u03b4. In other words, we assume that the\nelastic and inelastic scattering channels are independent.\nFor two samples A and B, with differing impurity levels, we then have:\n\u03baA =\n\nL0 T\n+ \u03baph ,\n\u03c1A + \u03b4\n\n(3)\n\n\u03baB =\n\nL0 T\n+ \u03baph .\n\u03c1B + \u03b4\n\n(4)\n\nWe assume here that \u03baph will be the same in each sample at low temperatures, since the presence of impurities\nis expected to have a minimal effect on low energy phonon\nmodes [36]. Since we measure both \u03ba and \u03c1 for each sample, at every temperature we can then solve these two\nsimultaneous equations to find both \u03b4 and \u03baph .\nThe solutions of these equations for \u03baph are shown using the data sets from the samples with \u03c10 = 0.31 and\n6.4 \u03bc\u03a9cm in Figure 4. The temperature dependence of\n\u03baph below 25 K is reasonably close to the T 2 dependence\ntypically expected from phonons scattered by electrons\n[36], and a fit to this form yields a coefficient \u03baph /T 2 \u223c\n0.018 mWK\u22123 cm\u22121 . Using different pairs of samples in\nEquations 3 and 4 yields almost identical curves for \u03baph ,\ndiffering in magnitude by only 20%, which demonstrates\nthe consistency of our analysis.\nThe phonon contribution that we estimate using this\nmethod is seen to be rather small compared to the total\nconductivity of the least disorder\n\n\f5\n1.0\n\u03c10 = 0.3 \u03bc\u03a9cm\n\n\u03b4 = w\u2212\u03c1 [\u03bc\u03a9cm]\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nT [K]\nFIG. 5: The electrical and thermal resistivity of ZrZn2 . The\nelectrical resistivity data are shown as solid lines, while the\nthermal resistivity data are shown as data points, calculated\nusing w = L0 \u00d7 T /\u03bael , where \u03bael = \u03batot - \u03baph as described in\nthe text.\n\nFIG. 6: The difference (\u03b4) of the thermal (w = L0 T /\u03bael ) and\nelectrical (\u03c1) resistivities versus temperature for the sample\nwith \u03c10 =0.31 \u03bc\u03a9cm. \u03bael is found by subtracting \u03baph from\n\u03batot , as outlined in the text. The line is a linear fit to the\ndata below 12 K.\n\nUsing our estimated form of \u03baph from Figure 4, we now\nsubtract this from \u03batot to find the electronic contribution\nto thermal transport. For the two samples with the lowest levels of disorder, \u03baph is small enough so that below\nT =15 K, \u03batot \u2243 \u03bael , meaning \u03bael is insensitive to the\ndetails of the phonon subtraction. A similar conclusion\nwas drawn in thermal transport studies below 10 K in\nthe very pure antiferromagnetic metal CeRhIn5 [14].\nWith the above considerations we are in a position to\nstudy \u03bael in isolation. In Figure 5 we use \u03bael to calculate\nthe thermal resistivity w defined in Equation 1, which\nwe plot alongside the electrical resistivity \u03c1. All three\nsamples display the same qualitative features: w \u2265 \u03c1 at\nfinite temperatures, and w \u2192 \u03c1 in the limit T \u2192 0 as\nexpected from the Wiedemann-Franz law.\nThe difference between the two resistivities is \u03b4, defined in Equation 2 and plotted versus temperature in\nFigure 6 for the cleanest sample. The striking linear T dependence of \u03b4 seen in our data persists over an order\nof magnitude in temperature. In the usual metallic state\nwe would expect \u03b4(T ) \u221d T 2 , since w = w0 + AT 2 and\n\u03c1 = \u03c10 + BT 2 . The deviation from this prediction in\nZrZn2 is clearly related to the presence of strong inelastic scattering processes operating at low temperatures.\nWe rule out the possibility that \u03b4 is influenced by the\npresence of phonon scattering at low temperatures since\nthese processes lead to a very different behaviour; in the\nconventional description phonon scattering leads to a T 5\nterm in \u03c1 and a T 3 term in w [36]. For T > 12 K \u03b4(T )\ndoes appear to gain some upward curvature, and we take\nthis temperature to be the point where phonon scattering ceases to be negligible. We note that the same linear\nbehaviour is confirmed in the sample with \u03c10 =2.3 \u03bc\u03a9cm.\n\nWe can compare our results with those obtained in\na more conventional magnetic system by Paglione etal.,\nwho studied the antiferromagnetic metal CeRhIn5 with\nTN = 3.8 K [14]. In that study, \u03b4 was seen to evolve\nas aT 2 + bT 5 below the N\u00e9el temperature and dropped\nrapidly towards zero above. The T 5 term is due to scattering from antiferromagnetic magnons. Clearly the temperature dependence of \u03b4 at low temperatures in ZrZn2\npresents an interesting case \u2013 it is difficult to reconcile\nwith either conventional electron-phonon physics or with\nthe model used for CeRhIn5 . What we show in Section IV\nis that a qualitative and semi-quantitative understanding\nof \u03b4(T ) may in fact be gained by considering scattering\nfrom spin fluctuations on the border of ferromagnetism\nin 3D. In other words, the distinct temperature dependence of \u03b4(T ) is a characteristic of the marginal Fermi\nliquid state.\n\nB.\n\nHeat Capacity\n\nThe measured specific heat capacity C(T ) of ZrZn2 is\nshown in Figure 7, which are in agreement with those\nreported previously [25]. Figure 7a is a plot of C versus T and Figure 7b gives C/T vs T 2 . The inset of\nFigure 7b gives (\u2206C = C \u2212 Cph )/T versus T 2 , where\nCph = \u03b2T 3 = (12\u03c0 4 /5)N kB (T /\u03b8D )3 is the phonon contribution to the specific heat at low temperatures in\nwhich \u03b8D is the appropriate Debye temperature. In the\nplot we have taken \u03b8D to be 340 K, a value consistent\nwith previous estimates [28].

[7, 8]).\nHere we give only an outline of the key ideas within the\nself-consistent renormalization (SCR) model mentioned\nin the introduction.\nA discussion of transport properties in this model has\nbeen presented most notably by Ueda and Moriya [37]. In\nits simplest form this model involves two isotropic bands.\nThe carriers in one band, referred to as the s-band, carry\nthe current while the electrons in the other band, referred\nto as d-band, scatter the s-electrons through a local s \u2212 d\nexchange interaction. The problem can be formulated\nin terms of the scattering of s-electrons from the spontaneous spin fluctuations arising in the d-electron system. The spin fluctuation spectrum is characterized by\na generalized dynamical and wavevector dependent susceptibility which emerges as a central concept in the theory. The s-electrons effectively transfer their momentum\nto the d-electrons. It is assumed implicitly that the delectrons in turn ultimately transfer their momentum to\nthe lattice via Umklapp processes and scattering from\nany residual impurities present.\nIf we ignore residual elastic scattering due to impurities, then for T << TF (where TF is the Fermi temperature for the s-band), \u03c1 and w in this model in the\nparamagnetic state can be written in the form\n\u03c1\nw\n\n\u001b\n\n=\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this section we consider the possible description of\nthe transport and specific heat data in terms of the SCR\nmodel. We begin with an outline of the model and then\npresent the predictions of the model for the model parameters that we believe are relevant to ZrZn2 . Finally, the\nresults of the calculations are compared with our transport and specific heat data.\n\nkB T\n\nXZ\n\nq<kc\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03c9\nd\u03c9 n\u03c9 (n\u03c9 +1) Im\u03c7q,\u03c9\nq\n\n\u001a\n\nF\u03c1\n(5)\nFw\n\nwhere n\u03c9 is the Bose function, n\u03c9 = (e~\u03c9/kB T \u2212 1)\u22121\nand\n\u0012 \u00132\nq\n(6)\nF\u03c1 =\nkc\n\nFw =\n\nIV.\n\n\u03b7\n\n\u0012\n\nq\nkc\n\n\u00132\n\n+\n\n\u0012\n\n~\u03c9\nkB T\n\n\u00132\n\n3\n4\u03c0 2\n\n2\n1\u2212\n3\n\n\u0012\n\nq\nkc\n\n\u00132 !\n\n(7)\n\nHere \u03b7 is a measure of the s-d coupling parameter, kc\nis a wavevector cut-off, equal to the diameter of the selectron Fermi surface in the usual description, and \u03c7q,\u03c9\nis the generalized wavevector and frequency dependent\nmagnetic susceptibility associated with the d-electrons.\nThe factor q 2 (i.e. in F\u03c1 ) arises from the fact that the\ncurrent cannot be degraded by scattering of s-electrons\nthrough an infinitesimal angle (i.e. q \u2192 0). Importantly,\nthe factor Fw for the thermal resistivity includes a second, dynamical term, which allows for the degradation\nof peak current even when q is vanishingly small through\nstrictly inelastic processes as discussed earlier. It is this\n\n\f7\ncrucial term which leads to the lower temperature exponent in w than in \u03c1. Note that if we set F to 1 then\nEquation 5 is proportional to the quasiparticle scattering\nrate.\nThe specific heat in this model arises primarily from\nthe d-electrons, and we consider the contribution from\ndissipative modes [8]. In the paramagnetic state on the\nborder of ferromagnetism at low temperature the specific\nheat may be expressed within the SCR model approximately in the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nd X \u221e\n\u2202log\u03c7q,\u03c9\nC = \u03bdT\n,\n(8)\nd\u03c9S\u03c9 Im\ndT q<q 0\n\u03c0\u2202\u03c9\n\nthe spin fluctuations parallel (k) to the ordered moment\nand perpendicular (\u22a5) to the ordered moment. The principal changes are as follows. Firstly, the static susceptibility \u03c7(T ) becomes strongly dependent on the component (there are two transverse (\u22a5) components and one\nlongitudinal (k) component). Secondly, the component\nof the generalized susceptibility has a spin-wave form below the cut-off qsw defined earlier. In this regime we have\n[8]\n\nS\u03c9 = kB [(1 + n\u03c9 )log(1 + n\u03c9 ) \u2212 n\u03c9 logn\u03c9 ] .\n\n(9)\n\nThe parameters \u03bd and qc correspond to the degeneracy\nof spin fluctuation modes and the wavevector cut-off respectively. In the usual description \u03bd = 3 and qc is the\ndiameter of the d-electron Fermi surface.\nTo evaluate the expressions for \u03c1, w and C we need\nin particular Im\u03c7q,\u03c9 , which we model using data from\ninelastic neutron scattering experiments. The cut off\nwavevectors kc and qc can be estimated from the known\nproperties of the Fermi surface, measured in quantum oscillation experiments [19]. The parameter \u03b7 can in principle be inferred from the Kadowaki-Woods relationship\nthat has been shown [38] to be consistent with the SCR\nmodel under conditions where this model reduces to the\nFermi liquid limit. Since we shall be mainly interested in\nthe relative magnitudes of \u03c1 and w we shall for simplicity scale both quantities to a reference value of \u03c1 at 15\nK (a crossover temperature above which phonon contributions to the transport properties become progressively\nless ignorable). Although we shall focus on the relative\nvalues of \u03c1 and w, we note that by applying the above\nKadowaki-Woods relationship we obtain in our calculations absolute values of \u03c1 and w, which are within 20%\nof the measured values for the model parameters relevant\nto ZrZn2 .\nWithin the SCR model \u03c7q,\u03c9 in the paramagnetic state\nmay be expressed in the form\n\u22121\n\u03c7\u22121\n(T ) + cq 2 \u2212 i\nq,\u03c9 = \u03c7\n\n\u03c9\n,\n\u03b3q\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03c7(T ) is the static magnetic susceptibility, and c\nand \u03b3 are constants dependent on the details of the\nd-electron band. The temperature dependence of the\nstatic susceptibility can in principle be determined selfconsistently within the SCR model. Here we take \u03c7(T )\nfrom bulk susceptibility data and the parameters c and\n\u03b3 from inelastic neutron scattering data, which could be\nsatisfactorily described by the model given by Equation\n10 [21].\nIn the ferromagnetic state below the Curie temperature TC we must distinguish between the components of\n\n(11)\n\n~\u03a9q = Dq 2 = 2\u03bcB M cq 2\n\n(12)\n\nwhere\n\nc\n\nwhere S\u03c9 is the entropy of an undamped boson, i.e. an\nharmonic oscillator, which is given by\n\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c7\u22121\n\u22a5q,\u03c9 = cq (1 \u2212 \u03c9 /\u03a9q )\n\nis the spin wave spectrum at small q.\nFrom inelastic scattering data for ZrZn2 we have approximately \u03b3=1.8 \u03bceV\u00c5 and c= 3\u00d7105 \u00c52 [21]. From\nthe measured Fermi surface of ZrZn2 we estimate qsw =\n0.07 \u00c5\u22121 [19]. From bulk measurements of the magnetic equation of state we arrive at models for \u03c7\u22a5 (T )\nand \u03c7k (T ) as shown in Figure 8 and M (T ) = M0 (1 \u2212\nT 2 /TC2 )1/2 where M0 =31 G. We note that the results\nof the calculations are not sensitive to precise forms of \u03c7\nand M or even to the precise values of the other parameters. For non-Fermi liquid behaviours to arise in this\nmodel we require principally that \u03c7\u22121 is small compared\nwith cq 2 for the characteristic wavevectors for thermally\nexcited spin fluctuations. In other words, we require that\nthe characteristic thermal wavevector, qT , is large compared with the magnetic correlation wavevector\np(i.e., the\ninverse of the magnetic correlation length \u03be = \u03c7/c) [8].\nIn practice, d-metals such as ZrZn2 cannot be represented simply in terms of two distinct species of electron\nas the above model suggests and the terms \"s-electron\"\nand \"d-electron\" may not have precise meanings. It is of\ninterest, however, to see if the model can capture some of\nthe behaviours of \u03c1, w and C, which we have measured\nin ZrZn2 .\nIt has been emphasized in more recent theoretical\nworks that there should be non-analytic corrections to\ncertain aspects of the SCR model [39\u201341]. Although relatively weak in 3D, they can nevertheless strongly modify\nthe magnetic equation of state in particular and give rise\nto a first-order ferromagnetic transition near the quantum critical point and potentially to a magnetically inhomogeneous state. We shall therefore not attempt to\ncalculate the magnetic equation of state self-consistently\nin this paper and take the temperature dependence of aspects of the magnetic equation of state from experiment.\nB.\n\nThe Marginal Fermi Liquid Limit of the SCR\nModel\n\nIn the limit qT >> \u03be \u22121 it may easily be shown from\nEquations 5 - 10 that in 3D\n\u03c1 \u221d T 5/3\n\n(13)\n\n\fInverse susceptibility [c.g.s units]\n\n8\n\n2500\n\nFor the electron-phonon scattering problem z = 1 and\nin 3D we recover the usual results, \u03c1 \u221d T 5 and \u03b4 \u221d T 3 .\nFor electron paramagnon scattering, however, z = 3 (see\nEquation 10 in the limit \u03c7\u22121 \u2192 0) and so in 3D we expect\n\u03c1 \u221d T 5/3 and \u03b4 \u221d T as in Equations 13 and 14. We\ncaution that for dissipative modes such as paramagnons\nthis elementary treatment fails if z is unity or lower. In\nthis case, \u03c1 and \u03b4 are determined by spin-fluctuations\nover all of q-space rather than just at low q and to obtain\nthe FL limit of the SCR model one must return to the\nfull expressions for \u03c1 and w in Equation (5).\n\n2000\n\u22121\n||\n\n\u03c7\n\n1500\n1000\n500\n0\n\n\u22121\n_|_\n\n\u03c7\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\nT [K]\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nFIG. 8: (color online) Plots showing the form of the dimensionless inverse volume susceptibility (in c.g.s units of\nOe/(emu cm\u22123 )) used in the resistivity calculations for ZrZn2 .\nThe expressions of these are as follows: \u03c7\u22121\n= 2(36TC (1 \u2212\nk\n\u22121\n= \u03c7\u22121\n(T /TC )4/3 )) and \u03c7\u22121\n\u22a5 =\n\u22a5 = 0 for T \u2264 TC and \u03c7k\n70(T \u2212 TC ) for T > TC . Here we take TC =28.5 K.\n\n\u03b4 = (w \u2212 \u03c1) \u221d T\n\n(14)\n\n\u03c4 \u22121 \u221d T log(T \u2217 /T )\n\n(15)\n\nC \u221d T log(T \u2217 /T )\n\n(16)\n\nand\n\nwhere T \u2217 is an appropriate temperature scale in each case\nseparately. Note that the temperature dependence of the\nscattering rate \u03c4 \u22121 is different from that of \u03b4 due to the\n(\u03c9/T )2 factor in Equation 7. Thus, in this limit, the\nSCR model reduces to the MFL model discussed in the\nintroduction, while in the opposite limit, qT << \u03be \u22121 , the\nSCR model reduces to the FL model. For the parameters\nrelevant to ZrZn2 we find that the crossover to the FL\nmodel occurs only at temperatures below 1 K at ambient\npressure[42].\nThe characteristic marginal Fermi liquid exponents for\n\u03c1 and \u03b4 can be understood by analogy to the corresponding electron-phonon scattering problem. In that problem\n\u03c1 \u221d qTd+2 and \u03b4 \u221d qTd , where d is the dimension of space.\nThe extra factor of qT2 in \u03c1 comes from the q 2 term in F\u03c1\n(Equation 6) which is absent in the difference between w\nand \u03b4. The temperature dependence of qT is given by the\ndynamical exponent z via T \u221d qTz so that one expects\n\u03c1\u221dT\n\nd+2\nz\n\nd\n\n\u03b4 \u221d T z.\n\n,\n\n(17)\n(18)\n\nC.\n\nCalculations of the Electrical and Thermal\nResistivities\n\nUsing the model and parameters given above we can\ncalculate the electrical and thermal resistivities and the\ndifference \u03b4 = w \u2212 \u03c1. The results of these calculations\nare shown in Figure 9 for several values of kc (which in\nthe model represents the typical diameter of the Fermi\nsurface of the light electrons that principally carry the\ncurrent).\nThe value of kc that gives the correct magnitude of\nthe scaled quantity \u03b4(T )/\u03c1(15 K) turns out to be around\nkc =0.4 \u00c5\u22121 . It is interesting to note that this is close to\nthe observed diameter of the sheet of the Fermi surface\nof ZrZn2 with the highest characteristic Fermi velocity\nobserved in this system. However, this fitted value of kc\nshould not be taken too seriously, given the complexity\nof the Fermi surface of ZrZn2 and the relative simplicity of the present model. What seems to be significant,\nhowever, is that the calculated temperature dependence\nof \u03c1 and \u03b4 are qualitatively very similar to the observed\nvalues given in Section III A, irrespective of the precise\nvalue chosen for kc , or indeed of the precise values of the\nother model parameters.\nWithin the experimental temperature range of interest, we find that the SCR model reduces essentially to the\nMFL model as discussed in the introduction. In particular, \u03c1 is predicted to vary approximately as T 5/3 and \u03b4\napproximately as T in the temperature range below 15 K\n(above which phonon contributions become progressively\nmore important in the measurements) and above about\n1 K (well below which the SCR model predicts a Fermi\nliquid form for \u03c1 and w).\n\nD.\n\nCalculations of the Specific Heat\n\nUsing the model and parameters in Section IV A we\ncan also calculate the specific heat contribution of the\nspin-fluctuations. Below TC we consider the contribution\nfrom both dissipative modes and from spin waves with\nq < qsw . The results of the calculations are shown in\nFigure 10 in the form of C/T vs T 2 for comparisons with\nthe inset of Figure 7b of the measured specific heat minus\nthe estimated phonon contribution.

The effect of increasing qsw is to cut off the low\ntemperature divergence of C/T .\n\nreminiscent of the logarithmic term in C expected for a\nmarginal Fermi liquid. The magnitude of the calculated\nC/T is somewhat lower than the measured value. This is\nreasonable since the SCR model does not include the effects of the electron-phonon interaction, nor, in the form\ndefined in Section IV A, the effects of any antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations that may be present.\n\nFIG. 9: (color online) Plot showing (a) the calculated electrical resistivity plotted against T 5/3 and (b) the calculated difference between the thermal and electrical resistivities plotted\nagainst T . The results are normalised relative to the calculated electrical resistivity at 16 K. The results are shown for\nthree values of the wavevector cut-off parameter kc (0.4 \u00c5\u22121\n(bottom), 0.6 \u00c5\u22121 (middle) and 0.8 \u00c5\u22121 (top)). The data for\nkc = 0.6 \u00c5\u22121 and kc = 0.8 \u00c5\u22121 are shifted upwards by 0.1\nand 0.2 respectively, for clarity.\n\ncapacity depends approximately logarithmically on the\nupper cut-off qc and is also somewhat sensitive to the\nspin-wave cut-off qsw , although the relative contribution\nfrom the dissipative modes with q > qsw dominates at all\ntemperatures. The results in Figure 10 correspond to the\nchoice qc = 1 \u00c5\u22121 , which is approximately equal to the\nobserved diameter of the large sheets of the Fermi surface\nwith high effective mass (and so low Fermi velocity).\nTo check on the sensitivity of the result to the lower\nspin wave cut-off several values of qsw around the value\nof 0.07 \u00c5\u22121 given in Section IV A have been used.\nComparing the inset of Figure. 7b with Figure 10 we\nsee that the measurements are qualitatively consistent\nwith the predictions of the SCR model, especially for a\nreasonable value for qsw . In particular, the upturn in\nC/T with decreasing temperature in the inset of Figure\n7b is consistent with the predictions of the SCR model.\nIn the limit qT >> \u03be \u22121 (see Section IV B) this upturn is\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn summary, we find that the temperature dependences\nof the electrical and thermal resistivities and the electronic specific heat in ZrZn2 can be understood qualitatively and even semi-quantitatively in terms of the selfconsistent renormalization model with model parameters\ninferred from independent measurements of the magnetic\nequation of state, the inelastic neutron scattering crosssection and the Fermi surface. Over a wide range in temperature, the SCR model reduces to the marginal Fermi\nliquid model characterized by an electrical resistivity \u03c1\nvarying as T 5/3 , a thermal resistivity w - \u03c1 varying as\nT and a logarithmic divergence in the low temperature\nspecific heat. We believe that taken together, these findings provide the most compelling evidence thus far for\nthe existence of the marginal Fermi liquid state in the\nfield of itinerant-electron ferromagnetism.\n\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Gil Lonzarich, Montu Saxena, Lara Sibley,\nEd Yelland and Stephen Rowley for useful discussions.\nThis work was funded by the Royal Society and EPSRC.

In MnSi, the MFL regime\nis squeezed out by the FL domain at low temperatures\nand the phonon contribution at higher temperatures. In\nZrZn2 the MFL is then expected to be a good approximation to the SCR model over a wide temperature range, up\nto over 50 K (with the exception of a narrow region close\nto TC ) if the phonon contributions can be ignored. The\nphonon contribution ignored in the SCR model in practice limits the applicability of the MFL to below about\n15 K in ZrZn2 .\n\n\f"}
