This phenomenon is known as pairing and it plays an important role in our understanding\nof many body physics (See Ref. [1] for a review). Historically, the physical significance of pairing was\nfirst realized with the microscopic theory of superconductivity developed by J. Bardeen, L. N. Cooper and\nJ. R. Schrieffer (BCS) in 1957 [2]. Following the success of the BCS theory, the idea of pairing was carried\nover to other areas of physics as well. In particular, pairing now plays an essential role in the nuclear shell\nmodel as the residual interaction between nucleons and successfully recounts for various properties of atomic\nnuclei [3, 4].\nIn order to investigate the influence of pairing on nuclear properties, many authors have used exact\nanalytical solutions of nuclear shell model which are available in some simplified cases. For example, in Ref.\n[5], Kerman considered pairs of nucleons coupled to angular momentum zero occupying a single orbit and\nintroduced the quasi-spin formalism in which these pairs can be treated within suitable representations of\nthe angular momentum algebra. He used this formalism to write down the exact energy eigenstates and\nto analyze the influence of pairing on the collective vibrations of nuclei. Quasi-spin formalism can also\nbe extended to the case of several orbits in which case the quasi-spin angular momenta corresponding to\ndifferent orbits commute with each other and the pairing term has the form of a coupling between these\nangular momenta. This observation establishes a direct link between the fermion pairing models and the\ninteracting spin models (see Refs. [6, 7, 8] for reviews). The exact diagonalization of the later model\nwas carried out by R. W. Richardson in 1962 in the case of the orbit-independent (i.e., reduced) pairing\ninteraction [9]. Later, it was clarified that the exact solvability of the pairing Hamiltonian in the reduced\npairing case can be understood in terms of a set of quantum invariants which commute with one another and\nalso with the Hamiltonian [10, 11]. These invariants are called rational Gaudin magnet Hamiltonians since\nthey stem from the work of M. Gaudin who was originally trying to find the largest set mutually commuting\noperators for a given system of interacting spins. In Ref. [10], Gaudin also showed that the pair creation\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: yamac@physics.wisc.edu\n\n\f2\nand annihilation operators which are used in building the simultaneous eigenstates of the rational Gaudin\nmagnet Hamiltonians form an algebra which is today known as the rational Gaudin algebra. It is worth\nmentioning that the rational Gaudin algebra is related to the rational solution of the classical Yang-Baxter\nequation which appears as an integrability condition in many contexts. As a result, the rational Gaudin\nmagnet operators and the rational Gaudin algebra have found many other applications in physics (see Refs.\n[6, 7, 8] for reviews and Refs. [12, 13, 14, 15, 16] for some interesting applications). They have also been\ngeneralized to include other underlying algebraic structures (i.e., higher rank algebras, super-algebras and\ndeformed algebras) besides the angular momentum algebra. There is an extensive literature on this subject\nand the interested reader may find the Refs. [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23] useful.\nAlthough the Richardson-Gaudin solution is successfully used in nuclear physics, the assumption of reduced\npairing sometimes proves to be too stringent. In many cases, the effective residual interactions between the\nnucleons are best described by a pairing force whose strength differs between the orbits1 . The Hamiltonian\nXX\nX X\n\u0124 =\n\u03b5j a\u2020j m aj m \u2212 |G|\ncj c j \u2032 a\u2020j m a\u2020j \u2212m aj \u2032 \u2212m\u2032 aj \u2032 m\u2032\n(1)\nj\n\nm\n\nj,j \u2032 m,m\u2032\n\nis frequently used to describe such an orbit dependent pairing interaction. Here, j denotes the total angular\nmomentum of an orbit and \u03b5j denotes its energy. The overall strength of the pairing term against the kinetic\nterm is measured by the constant |G| which has the dimension of energy whereas the relative pairing strengths\nare measured by the dimensionless constants cj . Richardson-Gaudin scheme mentioned above applies to the\nspecial case of this Hamiltonian in which all cj 's are the same whereas all single particle energy levels \u03b5j\nare different from one another (the reduced pairing case). The focus of this paper, however, is the opposite\ncase in which all the cj 's are different from one another and all single particle energies \u03b5j are the same (the\ndegenerate case).\nThe problem described by Hamiltonian given in Eq. (1) is exactly solvable in both the reduced pairing\ncase and the degenerate case. As mentioned above, in the reduced pairing case the solution was given\nby Richardson-Gaudin scheme and the corresponding quantum invariants are the rational Gaudin magnet\nHamiltonians. In the degenerate case, the exact energy eigenvalues and eigenstates were obtained in a series\nof papers by Pan et al [25] and by Balantekin et al [26, 27] and the purpose of the present paper is to identify\nthe corresponding quantum invariants in the degenerate case. In addition, it will be shown that the quantum\ninvariants in the degenerate case can be simultaneously diagonalized with the help of the algebraic Bethe\nansatz method. An interesting observation regarding the Bethe ansatz diagonalization is that although the\nreduced pairing and the degenerate cases are opposite of each other, the Bethe ansatz diagonalization of the\ninvariant operators in both cases is connected with the rational Gaudin algebra.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows: Section II is a brief review of the quasispin formalism and it\nalso serves to introduce some notation. In Section III, a short review of the Richardson-Gaudin formalism\nand the rational Gaudin magnet Hamiltonians is presented. The main results of this paper, i.e., the quantum\ninvariants in the degenerate case and their simultaneous diagonalization with the Bethe ansatz method are\npresented in Section IV. This section also contains a discussion about a symmetry in the spectra of these\nquantum invariants relating eigenvalues corresponding to different number of particles. In Section V, we\nconsider the rational Gaudin algebra and point out its relationship with the Bethe ansatz diagonalization\nin both the reduced pairing and the degenerate cases. Section VI summarizes the main conclusions. The\ndetails of some of the Bethe ansatz calculations can be found in the Appendix.\n\n1\n\nSee, for example, the treatment of the neutron pairs occupying the valance shell of Ni isotopes by Auerbach [24].\n\n\f3\nII.\n\nQUASI-SPIN FORMALISM AND THE EXACT SOLUTIONS OF THE PAIRING\nHAMILTONIAN\n\nIn the quasi-spin formalism, nucleon pairs coupled to angular momentum zero are created and annihilated\nat the level j by the operators\nX\nX\nSj+ =\n(\u22121)j\u2212m a\u2020j m a\u2020j \u2212m\nSj\u2212 =\n(\u22121)j\u2212m aj \u2212m aj m ,\n(2)\nm>0\n\nm>0\n\nrespectively. Together with the operator\nSj0 =\n\n\u0011\n1 X\u0010 \u2020\naj m aj m + a\u2020j \u2212m aj \u2212m \u2212 1\n2 m>0\n\n(3)\n\nthey obey the well known angular momentum commutations relations\n[Sj+ , Sj\u2212\u2032 ] = 2\u03b4jj \u2032 Sj0\n\n[Sj0 , Sj\u00b1\u2032 ] = \u00b1\u03b4jj \u2032 Sj\u00b1 .\n\n(4)\n\nAs a result, one has an angular momentum algebra (the so called quasi-spin algebra) for each orbit j such\nthat those angular momenta corresponding to different orbits commute with one another. The pair number\noperator for the orbit j is given by\nN\u0302j =\n\n\u0011\n1 X\u0010 \u2020\naj m aj m + a\u2020j \u2212m aj \u2212m .\n2 m>0\n\n(5)\n\nIt is related to the operator Sj0 given in Eq. (3) by the formula\nSj0 = N\u0302j \u2212\n\n\u03a9j\n2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03a9j is the maximum number of pairs which can occupy the level j. Note that j is always an half integer\nbecause of the spin-orbit coupling in the nuclei. As a result, if there are no unpaired particles at the level j,\nthen\n1\n\u03a9j = j + .\n2\n\n(7)\n\nAlso note that the pairing term in the Hamiltonian given in Eq. (1) does not act on the unpaired particles.\nIf there is an unpaired particle at the level j, its effect will be i) to add a constant \u03b5j to the Hamiltonian\nbecause of the kinetic term and ii) to reduce the maximum number of pairs which can occupy the level j\nby one, i.e., to take \u03a9j to \u03a9j \u2212 1. But here it will be assumed that there are no unpaired particles in the\nsystem. In this case, Eq. (6) implies that\n\u2212\n\n\u03a9j\n\u03a9j\n\u2264 Sj0 \u2264\n2\n2\n\n(8)\n\ni.e., quasi-spin algebra corresponding to the level j is realized in the \u03a9j /2 representation. Therefore, in\naddition to the physical angular momentum quantum number j, we also have the quasi-spin quantum number\n\u03a9j /2 for each level. The states\n|\n\n\u03a9j\n\u03a9j\n,\u2212 i\n2\n2\n\nand\n\n|\n\n\u03a9j \u03a9j\n,\ni\n2\n2\n\n(9)\n\nrespectively represent the situations in which i) the level j is not occupied by any pairs and ii) it is maximally\noccupied by pairs. In the presence of several orbits with angular momenta j1 , j2 , . . . , jn , the state\n|0i = |\n\n\u03a9j\n\u03a9j\n\u03a9j\n\u03a9j\n\u03a9j\n\u03a9j1\n, \u2212 1i \u2297 | 2 , \u2212 2 i\u2297 *** \u2297 | n , \u2212 n i\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(10)\n\n\f4\nrepresents a shell which contains no pairs whereas the state\n|0\u0304i = |\n\n\u03a9j \u03a9j2\n\u03a9j \u03a9jn\n\u03a9j1 \u03a9j1\n,\ni\u2297| 2,\ni \u2297 ***\u2297 | n ,\ni\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(11)\n\nrepresents a shell which is fully occupied by pairs.\nThe pairing Hamiltonian given in Eq. (1) can be written in terms of the quasi-spin operators given in Eqs.\n(2) and (3) as\nX\nX\nX\n\u0001\ncj Sj+ )(\ncj \u2032 Sj\u2212\u2032 ).\n(12)\n\u03b5j 2Sj0 + \u03a9j \u2212 |G|(\n\u0124 =\nj\n\nj\n\nj\u2032\n\nP\nNote that the operator j cj Sj+ in Hamiltonian (12) creates a pair of particles in such a way that cj can be\nviewed as the probability amplitude that this pair is found at the level j. For this reason the coefficients cj\nare usually called occupation probability amplitudes and they are normalized as\nX\n(13)\nc2j = 1.\nj\n\nAlthough an occupation probability amplitude is a complex number in general, the parameters cj can be\ntaken as real without loss of generality. Because if one cj is complex, a unitary transformation can always\nbe performed on the quasi-spin algebra corresponding to the level j to make that cj real. Also note that the\nP\nHamiltonian in Eq. (12) contains a constant term j 2\u03b5j \u03a9j which comes from Eq. (6). This constant term\nis not dropped because it guarantees that the energy of the empty shell is zero, i.e.,\n\u0124|0i = 0.\n\n(14)\n\nUsing the commutators given in Eq. (4), one can show that the fully occupied shell |0\u0304i is also an eigenstate\nof the Hamiltonian with the energy\nX\n\u0001\n2\u03b5j \u2212 |G|c2j \u03a9j |0\u0304i.\n(15)\n\u0124 |0\u0304i =\nj\n\nUnlike the empty shell |0i and the fully occupied shell |0\u0304i, the eigenstates of the pairing Hamiltonian\ncorresponding to a partially occupied valance shell are unknown in the most general case. But, as mentioned\nin the Introduction, exact energies and eigenstates are known in the two opposite cases. Namely, the reduced\npairing case characterized by\n\u03b51 6= \u03b52 6= * * * 6= \u03b5n\n\nc1 = c2 = * * * = cn ,\n\n(16)\n\nand the degenerate case characterized by\n\u03b51 = \u03b52 = * * * = \u03b5n\n\nc1 6= c2 6= * * * 6= cn .\n\n(17)\n\nThese solutions will be reviewed in the next two sections together with the corresponding quantum invariants.\nBut before closing this section, mention must be made of a third case in which exact eigenstates of the pairing\nHamiltonian are known. This solution is available in the presence of two orbits with unequal energies and\nunequal occupation probability amplitudes, i.e., [28]:\n\u03b51 6= \u03b52\n\nc1 6= c2 .\n\n(18)\n\nBut this third case will not be considered in this paper. Because the main interest of this paper is the\nquantum invariants of the pairing Hamiltonian and in the case of a two level system we have only two\nquantum invariants which are simply the Hamiltonian itself and the total pair number operator.\n\n\f5\nIII.\n\nREDUCED PAIRING AND THE GAUDIN MAGNET OPERATORS\n\nIn the reduced pairing case, described by Eq. (16), the pairing Hamiltonian given in Eq.

Using a variational technique, Richardson showed in Ref. [9] that the eigenstates of the\nHamiltonian given in Eq. (19) containing N pairs of particles are in the form\nJ + (\u03be1 )J + (\u03be2 ) . . .

Various other linear or nonlinear combinations of rational\nGaudin magnet operators can be used to built other useful exactly solvable models (see, for example, Refs.\n[13, 14, 16]).\n\nIV.\n\nINTEGRABILITY IN THE DEGENERATE CASE\n\nIn the case of several orbits having the same energy but different occupation probability amplitudes, i.e.,\nwhen the conditions in Eq. (17) are satisfied, the first term in the pairing Hamiltonian given in Eq. (12)\nbecomes a constant which is proportional to the total number of pairs in the shell. Discarding this term,\none can write the Hamiltonian as\nX\nX\ncj Sj+ )(\ncj \u2032 Sj\u2212\u2032 ).\n(33)\n\u0124D = \u2212|G|(\nj\n\nj\u2032\n\nExact eigenvalues and eigenstates of the Hamiltonian given in Eq. (33) were obtained in Refs. [25, 26, 27].\nThe purpose of this paper is to introduce the corresponding quantum invariants, i.e., the set of operators\nwhich commute with one another and with the Hamiltonian in Eq. (33).\nThe fact that the rational Gaudin magnet operators given in Eqs. (24) mutually commute with one another\nis independent of the values of the parameters \u03b5j . Naturally, one can try to replace the parameters \u03b5j in the\nGaudin operators with some arbitrary functions of cj and try to determine the form of these functions so\n\n\f7\nthat the new operators commute with the Hamiltonian in Eq. (33) as well. It turns out, however, that such\nas course of action does not yield the quantum invariants of the Hamiltonian given in Eq. (33)3 .\nIn order to find the invariant operators one can consider general number conserving operators in the form\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\nX\n(34)\nFjj \u2032 Sj+ Sj\u2212\u2032 + Sj+\u2032 Sj\u2212\nDjj \u2032 Sj0 Sj0\u2032 +\nP\u0302j = Aj Sj0 + Bj Sj+ Sj\u2212 +\nj \u2032 (6=j)\n\nj \u2032 (6=j)\n\nwhere Aj , Bj Djj \u2032 and Fjj \u2032 are some arbitrary coefficients. The condition that the above operators commute\nwith one another and with the Hamiltonian in Eq. (33) gives us the allowed values of these coefficients. A\nstraightforward calculation shows that the desired operators are given by\nP\u0302j = \u2212Sj+ Sj\u2212 + 2\n\nX\n\nj \u2032 (6=j)\n\n\u0011\nX cj cj \u2032 \u0010\nc2j \u2032\n+ \u2212\n+ \u2212\n0 0\n.\nS\nS\n+\nS\nS\nS\nS\n\u2032 +\n\u2032\n\u2032\nj\nj\nj j\nj j\nc2j \u2032 \u2212 c2j\nc2j \u2032 \u2212 c2j\n\u2032\n\n(35)\n\nj (6=j)\n\nThese operators mutually commute with one another\ni\nh\nP\u0302j , P\u0302j \u2032 = 0\n\n(36)\n\nfor every j and j \u2032 . They also commute with the Hamiltonian given in Eq.

(36) and (37), the invariants P\u0302j have the same eigenstates as the pairing Hamiltonian\n\u0124D given in Eq. (33). These eigenstates were given in Refs. [25, 26, 27] with the help of the Bethe ansatz\nmethod [29]. In what follows, the corresponding eigenvalues of the invariant operators P\u0302j will be presented.\nA summary of the results of this Section can be found in Table I.\nFollowing Refs. [25, 26, 27], let us introduce the pair creation and annihilation operators\nX cj\nX cj\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\nS + (x) =\nS\nS\n(x)\n=\nj\n2x\n2 x Sj .\n1\n\u2212\nc\n1\n\u2212\nc\nj\nj\nj\nj\n\n(40)\n\nHere, x is a complex variable and Sj\u00b1 are the quasispin operators introduced in Eq. (2). The Hamiltonian\nin Eq. (33) itself can be written in terms of these operators as\n\u0124D = \u2212|G|\u015c + (0)\u015c \u2212 (0).\n\n3\n\n(41)\n\nIn addition to the rational Gaudin magnet Hamiltonians, Gaudin also studied the so called trigonometric and hyperbolic\nGaudin magnet Hamiltonians which also mutually commute with one another. Similar to the rational case, however, one\ncannot choose the parameters of trigonometric or hyperbolic Gaudin magnet Hamiltonians so as to make them commute with\nthe Hamiltonian in Eq. (33).\n\n\f8\nThe eigenstates of the Hamiltonian \u0124D which are also simultaneous eigenstates of the invariants P\u0302j can\nbe written in terms of the pair creation and annihilation operators in Eq. (40). Below, these eigenstates\nwhich were obtained in Refs. [25, 26, 27] will be reviewed in the order of increasing number of pairs and the\ncorresponding eigenvalues of the invariant operators P\u0302j will be given.\nEmpty shell: The empty shell |0i given in Eq.

The state\n\u015c + (0)|0i\n\n(44)\n\nis an eigenstate where \u015c + (0) is obtained by putting x = 0 in the operator given in Eq. (40). This state was\nfirst suggested by Talmi in Ref. [30] and was shown to be an eigenstate of a class of Hamiltonians including\nthe Hamiltonian in Eq. (33).\nIn addition to the state in Eq. (44), the state\n\u015c + (x)|0i\n\n(45)\n\nis also an eigenstate if x is a solution of the Bethe ansatz equation\nX \u2212\u03a9j /2\n= 0.\n1/c2j \u2212 x\nj\n\n(46)\n\nThe eigenvalues of the operators P\u0302j corresponding to the eigenstates described above will be denoted by\n(1)\nand \u03bcj , respectively, i.e.,\n\n(1)\n\n\u03bbj\n\n(1)\n\n(47)\n\n(1)\n\n(48)\n\nP\u0302j \u015c + (0)|0i = \u03bbj \u015c + (0)|0i\nP\u0302j \u015c + (x)|0i = \u03bcj \u015c + (x)|0i.\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nThe eigenvalues \u03bbj and \u03bcj can easily be computed using the commutators given in Eq.

(44) is unique whereas the eigenstate in Eq. (45) represents several eigenstates. Because in general the Bethe ansatz equation (46) has more than one solutions and for each one\nof them we have an eigenstate in the form of Eq. (45). As a result, Eq. (48) also represents several\neigenvalue-eigenstate equations.\nEigenstates for 2 \u2264 N \u2264 Nmax /2: The results given above can be generalized to the states corresponding\nP\nto a shell which is at most half full. Let Nmax = j \u03a9j denote the maximum number of pairs which can\noccupy the shell in consideration.

Note that the states given in Eqs. (51) and (53) can be thought of as the\ngeneralizations of the states in Eqs. (44) and (45), respectively.\nThe Bethe ansatz equations given in Eqs. (52) and (54) have more than one solutions.4 Each one of these\nsolutions gives us an eigenstate in the form of Eqs. (51) and (53), respectively. One should keep in mind,\nhowever, that the states in Eqs. (51) and (53) are invariant under the permutations of the parameters and so\nare the corresponding Bethe ansatz equations. Consequently, solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations which\ndiffer only by a reordering of the variables should be counted as one solution.\nThe eigenvalues of the operators P\u0302j corresponding to the eigenstates given in Eqs.

(52), all the parameters zk were assumed to be different from each another and\nsimilarly for the Eqs. (54). As a result, any solution which contradicts this assumption should be discarded. In fact, it can\nbe shown that if any two parameters in the state (51) are equal to each other, then this state cannot be an eigenstate. A\nsimilar result is also valid for the state in Eq.

(11), i.e.,\nT\u0302 \u2020 |0i = |0\u0304i.\n\n(60)\n\nIn addition, it also transforms the pair creation operators into pair annihilation operators and visa versa:\nT\u0302 \u2020 Sj0 T\u0302 = \u2212Sj0\n\nT\u0302 \u2020 Sj\u00b1 T\u0302 = Sj\u2213\n\n(61)\n\nTherefore, the operator T\u0302 \u2020 transforms a state containing N particle pairs into states containing N hole-pairs.\nHowever, there is no particle-hole symmetry in the problem described by the invariants P\u0302j as can be easily\nverified by showing that\ni\nh\nP\u0302j , T\u0302 6= 0.\n(62)\nOn the other hand, it is easy to show that the operator\n\nB\u0302 = T\u0302 \u2020 S \u2212 (0)\n\n(63)\n\ncommutes with the invariants P\u0302j :\n[P\u0302j , B\u0302] = 0\n\n[\u0124D , B\u0302] = 0.\n\n(64)\n\nThis tells us that if |\u03c8i is a simultaneous eigenstate of the operators P\u0302j so is B\u0302|\u03c8i unless |\u03c8i is annihilated\nby B\u0302. It is easy to see from the definition of B\u0302 that if the state |\u03c8i has N particle-pairs, then the state B\u0302|\u03c8i\nhas N \u2212 1 hole-pairs. Because the operator B\u0302 first annihilates one pair and then replaces the remaining\nN \u2212 1 particle-pairs with hole-pairs. Consider, for example, the eigenstates with one pair of particles given\nin Eqs. (44) and (45). One can easily show, using Eqs.

Consequently, the states\n\u015c + (0)|0i and |0\u0304i have the same eigenvalues given by Eqs. (49) and (50). On the other hand, the state in\nEq. (45) which also has one pair of particles is annihilated by the operator B\u0302:\nB\u0302 \u015c + (x)|0i = 0\n\n(66)\n\nThis can be easily verified using the commutators (4) and the Bethe ansatz equation (46). Similarly, if we\nact on the eigenstate with N pairs of particles (2 \u2264 N \u2264 Nmax /2) given in Eq. (51), we find that\nB\u0302 \u015c + (0)\u015c + (z1 ) . . . \u015c + (zN \u22121 )|0i \u221d \u015c \u2212 (z1 ) . . . \u015c \u2212 (zN \u22121 )|0i\n\n(67)\n\n\u015c \u2212 (z1 ) . . . \u015c \u2212 (zN \u22121 )|0i\n\n(68)\n\nAs a result the state\n\nwhich has N \u2212 1 pairs of holes, has the same eigenvalues as the state in Eq. (51), i.e., those given in Eqs. (57)\nand (58). On the other hand, the state in Eq. (53) which also has N pairs of particles (2 \u2264 N \u2264 Nmax /2)\nis annihilated by the operator B\u0302\nB\u0302 \u015c + (x1 )\u015c + (x2 ) . . . \u015c + (xN )|0i = 0\n\n(69)\n\nas can be verified by using the commutators (4) and the Bethe ansatz equations given in Eqs. (54).\nThe eigenstates and the eigenvalues of the invariants P\u0302j described in this section are summarized in Table\nI. This table also contains the corresponding eigenvalues of the pairing Hamiltonian \u0124D given in Eq. (33)\nobtained from the eigenvalues of its invariants by using the formula (38). For example, the eigenvalue of \u0124D\ncorresponding to the state in Eq. (44) is given by\nX\n(1)\n(70)\nc2j \u03bbj ,\n|G|\nj\n\netc . . . The energy eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian \u0124D obtained from Eq. (38) are in agreement with those\nobtained earlier in Refs. [25, 26, 27].\n\n\f12\nV.\n\nRATIONAL GAUDIN ALGEBRA\n\nRational Gaudin algebra naturally appears from the pair creation and annihilation operators used in\nbuilding the simultaneous eigenstates of the rational Gaudin magnet Hamiltonians [10, 17]. Formally, it\nis defined as an infinite dimensional algebra whose generators J + (\u03bb),J \u2212 (\u03bb), J 0 (\u03bb) depend on a complex\nvariable \u03bb and obey the commutation relations\nJ 0 (\u03bb) \u2212 J 0 (\u03bc)\n,\n\u03bb\u2212\u03bc\nJ \u00b1 (\u03bb) \u2212 J \u00b1 (\u03bc)\n,\n[J 0 (\u03bb), J \u00b1 (\u03bc)] = \u00b1\n\u03bb\u2212\u03bc\n\n[J + (\u03bb), J \u2212 (\u03bc)] = 2\n\n(71)\n\nfor \u03bb 6= \u03bc. Commutators of J + (\u03bb), J \u2212 (\u03bb) and J 0 (\u03bb) at the same value of the complex parameter are given\nby taking the limit \u03bc \u2192 \u03bb. We are usually interested, however, with the finite dimensional (unfaithful)\nrealizations of this algebra. For example, it is not difficult to show that for any set of real parameters \u03b1j\nwhich are all different from one another, the operators\nJ + (\u03b1j ; \u03bb) =\n\nX\nj\n\nSj+\n\u03b1j \u2212 \u03bb\n\nJ \u2212 (\u03b1j ; \u03bb) =\n\nX\nj\n\nSj\u2212\n\u03b1j \u2212 \u03bb\n\nJ 0 (\u03b1j ; \u03bb) =\n\nX\nj\n\nSj0\n\u03b1j \u2212 \u03bb\n\n(72)\n\nform a realization of the rational Gaudin algebra given in Eqs. (71). Note that in Eqs. (72) we explicitly\nstated the dependence of the generators on the parameters \u03b1j . For different values of these parameters, one\nobtains different realizations of the rational Gaudin algebra.\nThe realization of the rational Gaudin algebra given in Eqs. (72) is related to the pairing problem in\nboth the reduced pairing case and the degenerate case for different values of the parameters \u03b1j . By taking\n\u03b1j = 2\u03b5j in Eq. (72), one obtains the operators given in Eq. (21) which are used in building the eigenstates\nin the reduced pairing case, i.e.,\nJ + (2\u03b5j ; \u03bb) =\n\nX\nj\n\nSj+\n2\u03b5j \u2212 \u03be\n\nJ \u2212 (2\u03b5j ; \u03bb) =\n\nX\nj\n\nSj\u2212\n2\u03b5j \u2212 \u03be\n\nJ 0 (2\u03b5j ; \u03bb) =\n\nX\nj\n\nSj0\n2\u03b5j \u2212 \u03be\n\n(73)\n\nThe pair creation operators given in Eq. (40) can also be obtained from a realization of the rational\nGaudin algebra although a change of basis is necessary. By taking \u03b1j = 1/cj in Eqs. (72) one obtains\nJ + (1/cj ; \u03bb) =\n\nX\nj\n\nSj+\n1/cj \u2212 \u03bb\n\nJ \u2212 (1/cj ; \u03bb) =\n\nX\nj\n\nSj\u2212\n1/cj \u2212 \u03bb\n\nJ 0 (1/cj ; \u03bb) =\n\nX\nj\n\nSj0\n1/cj \u2212 \u03bb\n\nand then the operators in Eq. (40) can be written as a linear combination of these operators, i.e.,\n\u221a\n\u221a\nJ \u00b1 (1/cj ; x) + J \u00b1 (1/cj ; \u2212 x)\nS \u00b1 (x) =\n2\n\n(74)\n\n(75)\n\nRational Gaudin algebra defined in Eqs. (71) appears in connection with various integrable models as\nmentioned in the Introduction. It is often the case that the step operators which are used in building the\neigenstates live in one of its realizations. Here we see that the integrability of the pairing Hamiltonian in the\nreduced pairing and the degenerate pairing cases can be studied in two different realizations of the rational\nGaudin algebra, namely those given in Eqs. (73) and (74), respectively.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we have obtained the quantum invariants of the pairing Hamiltonian in the degenerate case\nand simultaneously diagonalized them with the help of the algebraic Bethe ansatz method. Although in\n\n\f13\norder to obtain the eigenvalues one should first solve a system of Bethe ansatz equations which are nonlinear\nand coupled to each other, solving them usually proves to be much more convenient then a direct numerical\ndiagonalization method. Exact analytical methods for solving the Bethe ansatz equations also exist in some\nsimplified cases (see, for example, Refs. [16, 26, 31]). The quantum invariants obtained in this paper are\nthe counterparts of the well known rational Gaudin magnet Hamiltonians which play the same role in the\nreduced pairing case. It is worth mentioning that since the quantum invariants are mutually commuting\noperators, they can be used to build various other integrable models besides the ones considered in this\npaper.\nWe also pointed out that the integrability of the pairing Hamiltonian in both the reduced pairing and the\ndegenerate cases is connected with the rational Gaudin algebra. The generalizations of the rational Gaudin\nalgebra to different underlying algebraic systems (such as higher order Lie algebras, quantum algebras or\nsuperalgebras) have been used to study the reduced pairing model and the related rational Gaudin magnet\nHamiltonians in more general frameworks. The question then naturally arises whether or not one can do the\nsame generalization for the degenerate pairing model and the related quantum invariants too. For example\ncan the invariant operators of the degenerate pairing given in Eq. (35) be generalized to other algebraic\nsystems and then used to study different integrable many body systems? The answer of this questions goes\nbeyond the scope of this paper and will be considered elsewhere.\n\nAPPENDIX A: OBTAINING THE EIGENSTATES WITH BETHE ANSATZ METHOD\n\nThe simultaneous eigenstates and eigenvalues of the degenerate the operators given in Eq. (35) can be\nobtained using the method of algebraic Bethe ansatz. In this method, one first constructs a Bethe ansatz\nstate [29] which includes some undetermined parameters and then substitutes this state into the eigenvalueeigenstate equation P\u0302j |\u03c8i = Ej \u03c8i. The requirement that the Bethe ansatz state obeys the eigenvalueeigenstate equation yields a set of equations called the equations of Bethe ansatz, whose solutions determine\nthe values of the parameters in the Bethe ansatz state. For example, in order to obtain the eigenstates with\none pair of particles, one can start from a generic state in the form\nS + (x)|0i\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere S + (x) is defined in Eq. (40). Using the commutators given in Eq. (4), one can show that the action\nof the operator P\u0302j on such a state is given by\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n!\nX\nc S+\n\u2032\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\nj\nj\n(0)\n+\n\uf8edx\n\uf8f8 j j |0i.\nS\n(x)|0i\n+\n(A2)\nP\u0302j S + (x)|0i = Ej \u2212\n1 \u2212 c2j x\n1/c2j \u2032 \u2212 x 1 \u2212 c2j x\n\u2032\nj\n\nClearly, if we choose x in such a way that the second term on the right hand side of Eq. (A2) vanishes, i.e.,\nif\nX\n\u03a9j\nx\n(A3)\n2 \u2212 x = 0,\n1/c\nj\nj\nthen Eq. (A2) becomes an eigenvalue-eigenstate equation. One way is to satisfy Eq. (A3) is to take x = 0\nin which case Eq. (A2) yields the eigenvalue-eigenstate equation given in Eq. (47). Alternatively one can\nchoose x in such a way that it satisfies the Bethe ansatz equation\nX\nj\n\n\u03a9j\n=0\n1/c2j \u2212 x\n\nin which case, Eq. (A2) yields the eigenvalue-eigenstate equation given in Eq. (48).\n\n(A4)\n\n\f14\nThese results can be easily generalized to a state in the form\nS + (x1 )S + (x2 ) . . . S + (xN )|0i\n\n(A5)\n\nwhich has N pairs of particles where N \u2264 Nmax /2. The parameters x1 , x2 , . . . , xN are in general complex\nand they are all different from one another. In fact, by acting on the state given in Eq. (A5) with the\noperators P\u0302j one can easily show that if any two of the two parameters x1 , x2 , . . . , xN are the same, then\nthe state in Eq. (A5) cannot be an eigenstate. If, on the other hand, the parameters x1 , x2 , . . . , xN are all\ndifferent from one another, then by acting on the state given in Eq. (A5) with the operators P\u0302j given in Eq.\n(35), we find\n!\nN\nX\n\u03a9\nj\n(0)\nS + (x1 ) S + (x2 ) . . . S + (xN ) |0i\n(A6)\nP\u0302j S + (x1 ) S + (x2 ) . . .

(A6) becomes an eigenvalue-eigenstate equation for all the operators P\u0302j if we choose the variables\nx1 ,x2 ,. . . ,xN so as to satisfy\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nN\nX\nX\n\u03a9\n2\nj\n\uf8f8=0\n+\n(A7)\nxk \uf8ed\n2\u2212x\nxk \u2212 xl\n1/c\nk\nj\nj\nl=1(l6=k)\n\nfor every k = 1, 2, . . . , N .\n\nIf the variables x1 ,x2 ,. . . ,xN are all different from zero, then they clearly have to obey\nN\nX\n\nl=1(l6=k)\n\nX\n2\n\u03a9j\n+\n2\u2212x =0\nxk \u2212 xl\n1/c\nk\nj\nj\n\n(A8)\n\nand in this case, Eq. (A6) yields the eigenvalue-eigenstate equation given in Eq. (56).\nIf, on the other hand, one of the parameters, say x1 , is chosen to be zero (we cannot choose more than one\nxk to be zero since the parameters must be different from one another) then the Bethe ansatz equation (A7)\nis automatically satisfied for k = 1. In this case, the remaining parameters x2 , . . . , xN are to be found by\nsolving the N \u2212 1 equations\nX\nj\n\n2\n\u03a9j\n+\n+\n1/c2j \u2212 xk\nxk\n\nN\nX\n\nl=2(l6=k)\n\n2\n=0\nxk \u2212 xl\n\n(A9)\n\nfor k = 2, 3, . . . , N . If we rename the remaining N \u2212 1 variables as x2 = z1 , x3 = z2 , . . . , xN = zN \u22121 , then\nEq. (A6) becomes the eigenvalue-eigenstate equation given in Eq. (55).\n\n[1] D. J. Dean and M.
