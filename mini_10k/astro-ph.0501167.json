Thus there is now interest in testing the last of the\nmajor predictions of inflation: the existence of a roughly\nscale-invariant background of tensor (gravitational wave)\nperturbations. The amplitude of the tensor perturbations is typically described with the ratio of the temperature quadrupoles in the CMB T /S \u2261 C2tensor /C2scalar .\nThe value of T /S depends on the specific inflationary\nmodel through the relation T /S = V\u2217 /(3.7 \u00d7 1016 GeV)4 ,\nwhere V\u2217 is the energy density at the time during inflation when observable scales in the CMB (10\u22124 < k <\n10\u22122 h Mpc\u22121 ) exited the horizon. A detection of the\ntensor perturbations would bolster confidence in inflation, as well as providing a measurement of V\u2217 .\nIf T /S is large, then the tensor perturbations add to\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: chirata@princeton.edu\n\nthe l < 100 temperature power spectrum of the CMB,\nand the nondetection of this feature in the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data sets an upper\nlimit of T /S < 0.7 [7]. However the use of the temperature power spectrum to constrain T /S suffers from the\nlarge cosmic variance error bars on the low CMB multipoles, which impose a fundamental limit on measurements of T /S from ClT T . In addition, these measurements are model-dependent in the sense that modifications to the scalar power spectrum can produce excess\npower at l < 100 without invoking tensors (for example,\nT /S is partially degenerate with the running of the spectral index \u03b1s in the current data [8]). An alternative is to\nuse the CMB polarization, which can be decomposed into\nE and B modes [9, 10]. Since the scalar density fluctuations of multipole l have parity (\u22121)l , whereas the E and\nB polarization modes have parity (\u22121)l and \u2212(\u22121)l respectively, it follows that the scalars can produce only E\npolarization in linear perturbation theory. However tensor perturbations consist of both positive and negative\nparity modes for every value of l \u2265 2, so the tensors can\ncontribute to both E and B. The measurement of T /S\nthrough B-mode polarization thus is not limited by the\ncosmic variance associated with the scalars, and is not degenerate with any features in the scalar power spectrum;\ninstead it is limited by the observations, foregrounds, and\nnonlinear processes that can create B-mode polarization\nfrom scalar initial conditions.\nThe dominant nonlinear process that generates Bmode polarization in the CMB is gravitational lensing\n\n\f2\nof the E polarization generated during recombination.\nOn the large angular scales relevant for tensor B-mode\nsearches, the lensing B-mode appears as white noise with\nClBB \u2248 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22126 \u03bcK2 ; this would set a detectability\nlimit of (T /S)min = 6 \u00d7 10\u22125 for a full-sky experiment\nif \u03c4 = 0.17 and (T /S)min = 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 if \u03c4 = 0.07. (The\noptical depth to reionization \u03c4 is relevant since this determines the amplitude of large-scale polarization.) However, lensing results in higher-order correlations between\nthe E and B polarization modes that allow one to \"clean\"\nout the lensing B-mode [11, 12, 13]. The amount by\nwhich one can clean the B-mode using the iterative technique of Ref. [14] was computed by Ref. [15] as a function\nof the detector noise and beam size; for the most sensitive experiment considered (0.25 \u03bcK arcmin noise and\n2 arcmin beam), the B-mode polarization can be cleaned\ndown to ClBB \u2248 5.8 \u00d7 10\u22128 \u03bcK2 , which reduces (T /S)min\nby a factor of 40.\nThe polarized foregrounds contain both Galactic and\nextragalactic components. The extragalactic foregrounds\nsuch as point sources are approximately white noise and\nhence are largest on small angular scales, whereas the\nGalactic synchrotron and dust emission are expected to\nhave a significant polarization at low l. These can be at\nleast partially cleaned using their frequency dependence,\nwhich differs from the blackbody signature expected from\ntensors. However it is also possible to generate polarization via Thomson scattering of the CMB quadrupole by\nfree electrons in the Galaxy or other nearby structures.\nWhile this polarization signal is extremely small and is\nwell below the predicted level of the synchrotron and/or\ndust foregrounds at all frequencies, it cannot be cleaned\nusing frequency information since it is a blackbody signal. It can contain both E and B polarization if the\ndistribution of scattering electrons is anisotropic, hence\nit is a potential foreground for tensor B-mode searches.\nThe primary purpose of this paper is to investigate this\nThomson polarization from the local universe.\n\nII.\n\nGALACTIC CONTRIBUTION TO\nPOLARIZATION\nA.\n\nBasic model\n\nThe polarization Stokes parameters P = (Q, U ) produced by Thomson scattering are most easily determined\nin the line-of-sight formalism [16] as\n\u221a Z \u221e\n2\nX\n\u221a\n6\nP(n\u0302) = \u2212\ng(r, n\u0302)\n[T2m (rn\u0302) \u2212 6E2m (rn\u0302)]\n10 0\nm=\u22122\nE\n\u00d7Y2m\n(n\u0302)dr,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nT2m (rn\u0302) =\n\nZ\n\n\u2217\n(n\u0302\u2032 )T (n\u0302\u2032 )|rn\u0302 d2 n\u0302\u2032\nY2m\n\n(2)\n\nand\nE2m (rn\u0302) =\n\nZ\n\nE\u2020\nY2m\n(n\u0302\u2032 )P(n\u0302\u2032 )|rn\u0302 d2 n\u0302\u2032\n\n(3)\n\nare the temperature and polarization quadrupole moments of the CMB at position rn\u0302 relative to the observer,\nand\ng(r, n\u0302) = e\u2212\u03c4 (r,n\u0302)\n\nd\u03c4 (r, n\u0302)\ndr\n\n(4)\n\nis the Thomson visibility function, which depends on the\noptical depth \u03c4 (r, n\u0302) to distance r; we have trivially generalized from Ref. [16] to allow \u03c4 to depend on the direcE\ntion n\u0302. Here Ylm are the spherical harmonics and Ylm\nare the tensor spherical harmonics. (We normalize these\nR E\u2020 E\nto Ylm\nYlm (n\u0302) d2 n\u0302 = 1 over the whole sphere, with\nthe inner product P\u20201 P2 = Q\u22171 Q2 + U1\u2217 U2 ; this is consistent with Ref.\n\u221a [9] and with CMBFast [17] but differs\nby a factor of 2 from Ref.

If we break the lineof-sight integral into a piece contained within our galaxy\n(r < R = 100 kpc) and a piece external to the galaxy\n(r > R), we find to first order in \u03c4 (R, n\u0302):\nP(n\u0302) = [1 \u2212 \u03c4 (R, n\u0302)]Pcosmic (n\u0302) + Pgal (n\u0302),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Pcosmic (n\u0302) is the polarization that we compute if\nwe neglect the Galactic Thomson scattering and\n\u221a\n2\nX\n\u221a\n6\nE\nPgal (n\u0302) = \u2212\n(n\u0302),\n\u03c4 (R, n\u0302)\n(T2m \u2212 6E2m )Y2m\n10\nm=\u22122\n\n(6)\n(We have \u221aassumed that the cosmic quadrupoles\nT2m (rn\u0302) \u2212 6E2m (rn\u0302) at position rn\u0302 inside the Galaxy\ncan\n\u221a be replaced by their values at the observer, T2m \u2212\n6E2m , which is a good approximation since the cosmic quadrupole is dominated by perturbation modes\nwith wavenumber k \u226a R\u22121 .)

[18] is\nC2T T = 200 \u03bcK2.\nSince this temperature quadrupole has already been\nmeasured, we can compute the induced polarization if\n\n\f3\nwe have a map of the Galactic electron distribution. In\nthis paper we compute the polarization Pgal using the\nmodel of Cordes & Lazio [19] for the Galactic distribution\nof free electrons. This model is based on pulsar dispersion (DM) and scattering (SM) measures as well as SMs\nof other Galactic and extragalactic radio sources, and is\nappropriate for the electron content of the Galactic disk;\nthe predicted optical depth in the direction of the Galactic poles is 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 (North) or 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 (South). This is\nsomewhat larger than the optical depth of \u223c 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22125\npredicted by the older Taylor & Cordes model [20].\nThe input data to the Cordes & Lazio model is sparsely\nsampled, with a typical density of pulsars at high Galactic latitude (|b| > 20 deg) of n \u223c 6 sr\u22121 , and small-scale\nstructure in the electron density map is thus expected to\nbe lost [21]. As a crude estimate, we note that the number of modes per steradian is \u223c l2max /4\u03c0; setting this\nequal to n implies that structures smaller than lmax \u223c 9\nshould be lost. (The 14 non-pulsar SMs at high Galactic\nlatitude do not significantly alter this conclusion.) The\neffective lmax at high Galactic latitude may be even less\nthan this because some of the pulsars lie within the thick\ndisk and their lines of sight do not probe structure behind\nthem. Fortunately, this loss of resolution will not have\na large influence on the results of this paper because we\nwill find that the extragalactic contribution dominates\nthe Galactic thick disk for l \u2265 5.\nB.\n\nMilky Way corona\n\nThe Cordes & Lazio model does not include the Galactic corona component. Indeed, very few constraints on\nthe electron density in the corona are available, which\nis unfortunate because the corona may contain a significant fraction of the Milky Way's baryons [22]. Models\nof the Milky Way suggest a baryonic mass in the bulge\nand disk components of \u223c 5\u00d71010 M\u2299 , whereas the virial\nmass is estimated at \u223c 1012 M\u2299 [23]. For the currently favored baryon fraction fb = \u03a9b /\u03a9m = 0.17 \u00b1 0.01 [7], this\nsuggests that an additional \u223c 1.2 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 of \"missing\" baryons should either be present inside the Milky\nWay's virial radius or else must have been ejected. (Indeed, Ref. [23] argued that at least half of the baryons\nare missing even though they assumed fb = 0.1. Increasing fb to 0.17 only makes the problem worse.) Assuming\nthat a mass Mb of baryons were ionized and are present\nin a shell at radius R, they present a mean optical depth\n\u03c4\u0304 =\n\n(1 \u2212 Y /2)\u03c3T Mb\n(Mb /1011 M\u2299 )\n= 5.9 \u00d7 10\u22125\n,\n2\n4\u03c0mp R\n(R/100 kpc)2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Y = 0.24 is the Helium abundance, mp is the\nproton mass, and we have neglected the distance from\nthe Earth to the center of the Galaxy in comparison with\nR. The virial radius for the Milky Way is estimated\nas rvir \u223c 260 kpc [23], so that if a large fraction of the\nmissing baryons are significantly inside the virial radius\nthen the corona contribution to the optical depth could\n\nbe comparable to the disk contribution. If instead the\nbaryons are uniformly distributed in a ball, the radius\nand optical depth are related to the number density by\n\u00131/3\nMb /1011M\u2299\nnH /10\u22124 cm\u22123\n\u0012\n\u00131/3 \u0010\n\u00112/3\nMb\nnH\n\u22125\n\u03c4 = 4.6 \u00d7 10\n.(8)\n1011 M\u2299\n10\u22124 cm\u22123\n\nR = 195 kpc\n\n\u0012\n\nOne of the available constraints on the optical depth\nthrough the corona comes from the dispersion measures\n(DMs) of pulsars observed in the Large (LMC) and Small\n(SMC) Magellanic Clouds. The Thomson optical depth\nandR the DM along a line of sight are both proportional\nto ne dr, hence they are related by the equation \u03c4 =\n2.05\u00d710\u22126DM where the DM is in units of cm\u22123 pc. The\nobserved DM in the Magellanic Cloud pulsars is greater\nthan that predicted by the Galactic thick disk model [19]\nby 16\u201391 cm\u22123 pc depending on the pulsar [21]. However\nmuch of this excess DM may be internal to the Magellanic\nClouds and not part of the Galactic corona. Cordes &\nLazio [21] argue for this interpretation since the DMs of\npulsars not in the Magellanic Clouds are only fit if the\nelectron density falls off beyond \u223c 1 kpc from the plane of\nthe Galaxy (see their Sec. 3.1.1). This is also consistent\nwith the factor of \u223c 5 disparity among DM excesses in\nthe LMC along lines of sight separated by only a few\ndegrees. In any case the contribution of the Galactic\ncorona along the line of sight to the LMC at a distance\nof 50 kpc is limited to DM\u2264 16 cm\u22123 pc or \u03c4 \u2264 3 \u00d7 10\u22125.\nIf this upper limit is typical of lines of sight to 50 kpc and\nwe use Eq. (7) with Mb = 1.2 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 and R = 50 kpc\nas an upper limit on the optical depth beyond 50 kpc,\nwe find that the optical depth through the Milky Way\ncorona is at most 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 . If one instead assumes the\nuniform ball model (Eq. 8) for the corona and assigns\na baryonic mass Mb = 1.2 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 , the DM to the\nLMC provides an upper limit of nH < 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm\u22123\nand \u03c4 < 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22124 . This upper limit is significantly\nstrengthened if the corona density is assumed to decrease\noutwards as a power-law more gradual than \u221d 1/r since\nthis places the bulk of the baryons even farther away\n(if the power law is steeper than 1/r the optical depth\ndiverges at small r, and would be cut off by either some\ncore radius or our finite distance from the center of the\nGalaxy).\nThere are other constraints on the density of the Galactic corona. If the infall velocities of high-velocity clouds\nare assumed to be less than their terminal velocity due to\ndrag in the Galactic corona, the density of the corona is\nlimited to nH < 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm\u22123 at 100 kpc [24]. Models of the kinematics [25] and H\u03b1 emission [26] from\nthe Magellanic Stream argue for nH \u223c 10\u22124 cm\u22123 and\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm\u22123 respectively at radius 50\u201365 kpc (but\nsee criticism of these models arguing that survival of the\nstream then requires nH < 10\u22125 cm\u22123 [27]). Interaction\nof high-velocity clouds with a Galactic corona is also suggested in order to produce some of the O vi detected in\n\n\f4\n\nLensing (uncleaned)\n\n-5\n\n10\n\nLensing (cleaned)\n\nBB\n\n2\n\nPower spectrum L(L+1)CL /2\u03c0 (\u03bcK )\n\nContamination of all-sky power spectrum\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-5\n\nTensors (T/S=10 )\n\n-7\n\n10\n\nregion in Eq. 2. Unlike the case of an all-sky map where\nEq.

We choose the quadratic estimator, which involves the vector x = (Q1 , ...QN , U1 , ...UN )\nof length 2N , where N is the number of pixels.

The dashed line shows\nthe tensor B-mode spectrum for T /S = 10\u22125 . The Galactic\nThomson scattering contribution is shown by the solid line\nwith points; note that due to the approximate parity symmetry of the Galactic electron distribution, the odd l modes\nhave much more power than even l.\n\nabsorption [28, 29]. If the higher values of nH [25, 26]\nare correct, and the corona remains this dense out to\nradii > 100 kpc, then it is possible that the optical depth\nthrough the halo may be \u223c 10\u22124 .\nIn order to assess the B-modes produced in the corona,\nwe must remember that it is the fluctuations in optical\ndepth \u03b4\u03c4 , rather than the mean optical depth \u03c4\u0304 , that\nproduces B-modes. We will return to this point in the\ndiscussion, and for now we focus on the smooth Cordes\n& Lazio model [19] for the known population of Galactic\nelectrons.\nIII.\n\nPOWER SPECTRUM\n\nWe next analyze the B-mode power spectrum of the\nscattered radiation. In the case of an all-sky experiment,\none can simply do the spherical harmonic decomposition\nClBB (scat) =\n\nZ\nl\n2\nX\n1\nB\u2020\nYlm\n(n\u0302)P(n\u0302)d2 n\u0302 , (9)\n2l + 1\nm=\u2212l\n\nThis is shown in Fig. 1, along with the lensing contribution, and the gravitational waves for T /S = 10\u22125 as\ncomputed by CMBFast [17].\nA realistic low-l B-mode experiment will exclude the\nGalactic Plane since this is where the foreground contamination is the worst. We would therefore like to understand the B-mode contamination on the cut sky. Here\nwe will consider cutting out the region within 10 degrees\nof the Galactic Plane; note that we are cutting this region out of the final map Pgal , not out of the integration\n\ni\n\nB\u2020\nB\n+ClBB Ylm\n(n\u0302i )Ylm\n(n\u0302j )\n\n= Nij +\n\nX\n\np\u03b1 C\u03b1 ij ,\n\n(10)\n\n\u03b1\n\nwhere N is the noise covariance matrix, p\u03b1 are the parameters of the covariance matrix, and C\u03b1 are the power\nspectrum templates. Our objective is to estimate the\nparameters p\u03b1 . The quadratic estimator determines the\nparameters using the relation\np\u0302\u03b1 = [F\u22121 ]\u03b1\u03b2 q\u03b2 ,\n\u0001\n1\n1\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\nq\u03b1 = x\u2020 C\u22121\n0 C\u03b1 C0 x \u2212 Tr C0 C\u03b1 C0 N ,\n2\n2\n\u0001\n1\n\u22121\nF\u03b1\u03b2 = Tr C\u22121\n(11)\n0 C\u03b1 C0 C\u03b2 ;\n2\n\nhere F is the Fisher matrix and C0 is a positive definite Hermitian weighting matrix. The quadratic estimator method is unbiased regardless of the choice of C0 in\nEq. (11), but is only optimal if C0 is the true covariance\nmatrix. (C0 controls the relative weighting of modes.)\nIn our case, we will choose C0 to contain the noise due\nto lensing after the iterative cleaning, so that it equals C\nif Nij is white noise with 0.83\u03bcK arcmin and ClBB = 0,\nand ClEE \u226bnoise in Eq. (10) since the CMB E-mode\npower spectrum is large.\nTo understand the relationship between this method\nand the E/B decomposition of Ref. [30], note that as\nClEE \u2192 \u221e, any polarization mode x that has non-zero\ninner product with an E mode has x\u2020 C0 x \u2192 \u221e. Also,\nany mode that is orthogonal to all E modes \u2013 i.e. that\nis a \"pure B-mode\" in the terminology of Ref. [30] \u2013\nhas C0 x = Nx and so x is an eigenvector of C\u22121\nwith\n0\neigenvalue given by the inverse noise variance per pixel.\nThus the quadratic estimator procedure Eq. (11) can be\nthought of as a method for projecting out the pure Emodes and ambiguous modes, and then computing the\npower spectrum; the Fisher matrix F serves also as the\nmatrix of window functions for the quadratic estimators\nq\u03b1 . (This same type of projection has been suggested by\nRef. [31].)\nNumerically, we have evaluated Eq. (11) using a weight\nwith ClEE equal to 100 times the noise level for 2 \u2264 l \u2264\nlmax = 80. We use the implementation of the quadratic\nestimators described in Ref.

The points show\nthe polarization band powers from Thomson scattering (the\nopen squares represent negative band powers). Some power\nmay be missing at l \u2265 10 due to the sparse sampling of the\npulsars used to construct the electron density model.\n\n(of order 1 kpc) is comparable to (and in some cases,\ngreater than) the distance to the foreground-emitting regions. Since WMAP reports the temperature observed in\na direction n\u0302 but cannot specify the distance to the emitting region, one needs an additional assumption in order\nto calculate Pgal . We will make the assumption here that\nthe microwave foreground can be decomposed into a \"local\" contribution from nearby (distances much less than\nthe size of the Galaxy) and a \"global\" contribution from\ndistances of order the size of the Galaxy. The local contribution we assume to be plane-parallel; in this case the\nquadrupole is independent of the position of the scattering electron and we may use the observed quadrupole at\nEarth. The global contribution to the photon quadrupole\nat the position of the scattering electron can also be taken\nto equal the foreground quadrupole observed at Earth,\nsince the distance to the scattering electron (<\n\u223c 1 kpc)\nis small compared to the size of the Galaxy. Being nonaxisymmetric, the global contribution can produce both\nE and B polarization. Within this set of assumptions, we\ncan calculate the B-modes from Thomson scattering of\nGalactic foreground emission by repeating the procedure\nof Sec. III with the uncleaned WMAP maps. Since these\nmaps contain both foregrounds and CMB, the result \u2013\nshown in Fig. 3 \u2013 is the B-mode power spectrum from\nThomson scattering of both the CMB and the Galactic\nforeground emission.\n\nV.\n\n5 pixelization system [33], which has 12 288 pixels. In\nFig. 2 we have shown the power spectrum of the B-mode\npolarization obtained if we accept only the 10 112 pixels\nat Galactic latitude |b| > 10 degrees. We have plugged\nthe resulting polarization data vector x of length 20 224\n\u22121\ninto Eq. (11), leaving out the Tr (C\u22121\n0 C\u03b1 C0 N) term in\nq\u03b1 since the Thomson scattering map does not include\nthe noise. The resulting ClBB (scat) represent the additive bias to the B-mode power spectrum estimators due\nto the Galactic Thomson scattering component. (These\nare negative for l = 4, 5; note that on a cut sky it is possible for the power spectrum estimator to become negative\neven without noise subtraction.)\n\nIV.\n\nPOLARIZATION FROM SCATTERED\nGALACTIC EMISSION\n\nIn addition to scattering the CMB quadrupole, Galactic electrons can scatter the microwave foreground emission emitted by the Galaxy itself. In order to compute\nthis effect, one needs not only a model for the distribution\nof electrons but also for the foreground emission, so that\none can calculate the quadrupole in Eq. (6). While the\nforeground emission at frequencies from 23\u201394 GHz has\nbeen mapped out by WMAP, the quadrupole T2m (rn\u0302)\nat the scattering electron may differ from the locally observed quadrupole because the distance to the electron\n\nEXTRAGALACTIC CONTRIBUTION\n\nIn addition to the Galactic electrons, the CMB\nquadrupole can also be scattered off of nearby structures in the universe, generating B-mode polarization.\nIn this section, we begin by computing the B polarization from structures out to a distance of 80 h\u22121 Mpc\nusing a model for the local electron distribution. We\nthen calculate the expected ClBB statistically from the\npower spectrum. The former method has the advantage\nof corresponding approximately to the actual realization\nof the electron distribution in the universe, whereas the\nlatter method is better for addressing the contribution\nfrom larger distances.\n\nA.\n\nConstrained realization method\n\nOur first method for estimating the local extragalactic contribution to the B-mode polarization is to use\nthe \"constrained realization\" N -body simulations from\nMathis et al. [34] and assume that the electron density traces the dark matter. These simulations have\nconstrained initial conditions intended to reproduce the\nstructures observed in the local universe out to a distance\nof \u223c 80h\u22121 Mpc and on scales larger than 5h\u22121 Mpc (on\nsmaller scales, the initial conditions are filled in with a\nGaussian random field with appropriate power).

This figure is the same as Fig. 2 except that we have replaced the cosmic\nquadrupole with the raw K and W band quadrupoles observed by WMAP (no frequency cleaning). Some power may be missing\nat l \u2265 10 due to the sparse sampling of the pulsars used to construct the electron density model.\n\ncosmology; here we have used the former (with \u03a9m = 0.3,\nH0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, and \u03c38 = 0.9) as it corresponds\nmost closely with the currently favored cosmological parameters.\nThe perturbation to the optical depth due to nearby\nextragalactic structures is calculated according to\n\u03b4\u03c4 = \u03c3T\n\nZ\n\nn\u0304e (z)\n\u03b4e dr,\n1+z\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03b4e is the fractional electron density perturbation;\nhere we assume \u03b4e = \u03b4, which should be valid except on\nvery small scales where the baryons are segregated from\nthe dark matter. We have written this as an integral\nover the comoving distance r. The mean electron density\nassuming complete ionization is\n3\u03a9b H02 (1 \u2212 Y /2)\n(1+z)3 = 2.2\u00d710\u22127(1+z)3 cm\u22123 ,\n8\u03c0Gmp\n(13)\nwhere G is Newton's gravitational constant and the\nbaryon density \u03a9b h2 is from WMAP [4]. Here we have\nneglected redshift evolution of n\u0304e (z)/(1 + z) and \u03b4e since\nthe simulation goes out to a distance of 80h\u22121 Mpc\n(z = 0.027); n\u0304e (z)/(1 + z) is only 5.4% greater at\nz = 0.027 than today, while \u03b4e is slightly less (by 1.3% in\nthe linear regime). Equation (12) cannot be used directly\nbecause the dark matter distribution in the simulation\nis represented by individual particles; we have therefore\nsmoothed with a Gaussian of 1\u03c3 width 0.1h\u22121 Mpc in\neach dimension. The Poisson noise at the smoothing scale\nk = 10h/Mpc is 4% of the linear matter power spectrum.\nPhysically, the free electrons cannot trace the dark\nmatter down to arbitrarily small scales, and one would\nexpect smoothing on scales shorter than the Jeans\nn\u0304e =\n\nwavenumber,\ns\np\n4\u03c0G\u03c1\u0304(1 + \u03b4)\n104 K\n= 4.2h Mpc\u22121\n(1 + \u03b4),\nkJ =\ncs\nTg\n(14)\nwhere cs is the sound speed, Tg is the gas temperature, and we have assumed the sound speed relation\nc2s = 5kB T /3\u03bc with mean mass per particle \u03bc = 0.59mp ,\nappropriate for ionized gas with Y = 0.24. The intergalactic medium is photoionized so we expect Tg \u2265 104 K\nand hence in regions of average density all structures\nsmaller than kJ\u22121 \u2265 0.2h\u22121 Mpc should be washed out if\nwe consider \u03b4e instead of \u03b4. In this sense our estimate using smoothing at 0.1h\u22121 Mpc is conservative and should\noverestimate ClBB . Most of the small-scale power is however in overdense regions where 1 + \u03b4 \u226b 1, so depending\non Tg in these regions the smoothing scale may be different from the typical value of kJ\u22121 . We find that the\nl < 10 modes are only slightly affected (by < 20% ) if we\nincrease the smoothing length to 0.5h\u22121 Mpc, indicating that the results are not dominated by the small-scale\nmodes.\nOnce \u03b4\u03c4 maps are constructed, these can be fed\nthrough Eq. (6) to compute the polarization signal. The\npower spectrum on a cut sky (retaining the |b| > 10 degrees region) can then be determined from a quadratic\nestimator, as was done in Sec. III.\n\nB.\n\nPower spectrum method\n\nOur second approach to computing ClBB is to estimate\nthe power spectrum of the electron density perturbations,\nand then convert this via Eq. (6) into a power spectrum\n\n\f7\nfor the polarization. This approach is purely statistical\nand does not require any particular realization of the\nelectron distribution. Its principal disadvantage is that\nthe sky \u03c4 (n\u0302) may look very different from different parts\nof the universe, and thus the local value of Cl\u03c4 \u03c4 may\ndeviate substantially from the global average computed\nhere.\nThe perturbation to the Thomson optical depth in direction n\u0302 is given by Eq. (12). We begin with the case\nwhere \u03b4e is a Fourier wave, \u03b4e (r, n\u0302) = eirk*n\u0302\u2212\u01ebr , where \u01eb is\nan infinitesimal parameter that forces convergence of the\nintegral at infinity.

(27) given any power spectrum\n\u22062\u03b4e (k), which here we will assume to be the nonlinear\nmatter power spectrum. We have computed the spectrum using the Eisenstein & Hu [38] transfer function\nand the Peacock & Dodds [39] nonlinear mapping. The\nresults from this calculation are shown in the thick line in\nFig. 4(a). For comparison, we have also shown (thin line)\nthe results obtained by cutting off the integral in Eq. (19)\nat kmin = (l+1/2)/rmax, where rmax = 80h\u22121 Mpc is the\nradius to which we integrate in the constrained realization method. Within the context of the Limber approximation, this measures the amount of this power that is\nrecovered by the constrained realization method. The\ndifference between the thick and thin curves in Fig. 4(a)\nrepresents the contribution to ClBB coming from structures farther away than 80h\u22121 Mpc; this is 50% of the\npower at l = 10, with nearby structures dominating at\nlower l and more distant structures at higher l.\nAlso shown is the power spectrum from the constrained\nrealization method (points in Fig. 4a). We can see from\nthe figure that the power spectrum ClBB obtained from\nthis method is greater than the predicted result out to\na distance of 80h\u22121 Mpc (thin line). This indicates that\nthe nearby universe is more inhomogeneous than average, which is not entirely surprising since we live in an\noverdense region of the universe and it is these regions\nthat contribute most of the small-scale power.\nSince the Mathis et al. [34] simulations provide an\nactual optical depth map, it is possible to construct an\nactual realization for the combined Thomson scattering\nsignal from the Milky Way's disk and from nearby extragalactic structures. We have computed the power\nspectrum ClBB of this realization with the quadratic\nestimator, and added to it the \"missing\" power from\nr > 80h\u22121 Mpc; the result is shown in Fig. 4(b). This is\nour final result for the frequency-independent, Thomsoninduced B-mode power spectrum from the Galactic disk\nand nearby extragalactic structures (but excluding the\ncorona). The contribution is roughly (1\u20132) \u00d7 10\u22124 \u03bcK per\nlogarithmic interval in l, which is well below the cleaned\nlensing signal even for an optimistic experiment.\nWe can be more quantitative about the effect on the\nestimation of the tensor signal T /S by using the tensor signal CT /S \u2261 dC/d(T /S) as a template in the\nquadratic estimator instead of the band powers. In\nthis case we can get the spurious contribution to T /S\nfrom the equation \u2206(T /S) = qT /S /FT /S,T /S , where qT /S\nand FT /S,T /S are computed using Eq. (11) with CT /S .\nThe map x to be inserted into the equation for qT /S is\nthe sum of the known Galactic disk and extragalactic\n(r < 80h\u22121 Mpc) signals and the unknown extragalactic signal from r > 80h\u22121 Mpc, which we denote x(1)\nand x(2) respectively. We can put into the estimator the\nactual value of x(1) , whereas we must account for x(2)\n\nstatistically using its covariance matrix C(2) :\n\u2206(T /S) =\n\nhqT /S i\nFT /S,T /S\nh1\n\n\u22121 (1)\nx(1)\u2020 C\u22121\n0 CT /S C0 x\ni\n1\n\u22121 (2)\nC\nC\nC\n)\n.\n(28)\n+ Tr (C\u22121\nT /S 0\n0\n2\n\n= (FT /S,T /S )\u22121\n\n2\n\nThis equation yields \u2206(T /S) = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22127 for the template with optical depth \u03c4 = 0.17, and 3.6 \u00d7 10\u22127 for\n\u03c4 = 0.07. This is negligible, since even for the optimistic\n(0.25 \u03bcK arcmin noise, 2 arcmin beam) experiment, the\nFisher matrix uncertainties in T /S are 6.2 \u00d7 10\u22127 and\n1.7 \u00d7 10\u22126 for \u03c4 = 0.17 and 0.07 respectively.\nVI.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have considered the contribution to the CMB Bmode polarization from Thomson scattering in the local\nuniverse, which is a potential contaminant to the gravitational wave signal. Our findings are that:\n1. The Thomson scattering signal from the Galactic\ndisk and from nearby extragalactic structures is\nwell below the weak lensing B-modes even after\nthe lensing signal is \"cleaned\" out using a lensing\nreconstruction from a very optimistic experiment.\nThis signal is believed to be negligible.\n2. The Galactic disk also Thomson-scatters the foreground radiation emitted by the Milky Way. At\nthe low multipoles, this radiation can exceed the\ncleaned lensing signal; in the K band it is roughly\nequal to the uncleaned lensing signal at l = 2\u2013\n3. However this signal is strongly frequencydependent, and in principle can be removed by the\nsame techniques used to clean other Galactic foregrounds.\n3. Thomson scattering within the hot Galactic corona\nmakes an unknown contribution to the B-modes,\ndepending on the flucutations in the optical depth\nthrough the corona. The contribution can be\nroughly estimated based on Eq. (27):\n3C2T T 2\nl(l + 1) BB\nCl \u223c\n\u2206 \u223c 2.4 \u03bcK2 \u22062\u03c4 ;\n2\u03c0\n80\u03c0 \u03c4\n\n(29)\n\nthis can exceed the cleaned lensing signal if the\nlarge angular scale fluctuations in the optical depth\nthrough the corona are \u2206\u03c4 \u2265 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 . Since a\nmean optical depth through the corona of up to\n\u03c4\u0304 \u223c O(10\u22124 ) appears to be reasonable, and there\nare only very limited constraints on the angular\ndistribution of free electrons in the corona, fluctuations of \u2206\u03c4 \u2265 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 cannot yet be ruled out.\n\n\f9\n(b) Total (Galactic + extragalactic) B-modes\n\nPower spectrum\nPower spectrum (to 80 h-1Mpc)\nMathis et al\n\n10-6\n\n2\nPower spectrum, L(L+1)CBB\nL /2\u03c0 (\u03bcK )\n\n2\nPower spectrum, L(L+1)CBB\nL /2\u03c0 (\u03bcK )\n\n(a) B-modes from nearby extragalactic structure\n\n10-7\n\n10-8\n\n10-9\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n10\nMultipole, L\n\n15\n\n20\n\n30\n\nLocal scattering\nTensors (T/S=10-5)\nCleaned lensing\n\n10-6\n\n10-7\n\n10-8\n\n10-9\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n10\nMultipole, L\n\n15\n\n20\n\n30\n\nFIG. 4: The contribution from nearby extragalactic structures to the B-modes. Panel (a) shows the power spectrum for\nthe constrained realization method of Sec. V A (points), the power spectrum method of Sec. V B (thick line), and the power\nspectrum method with the integration cut off at rmax = 80h\u22121 Mpc (thin line). Panel (b) shows the total B-mode from\nlocal scattering (points), constructed by taking the optical depth map from the Galaxy and nearby structures, computing the\nresulting ClBB using the quadratic estimator, and then adding the estimated power from r > 80h\u22121 Mpc. For reference, the\ncleaned-lensing and tensor curves from Fig. 2 are shown.\n\nOf these, the scattering from the Galactic corona is of\nthe most interest. In principle, detection of this signal\nwould provide evidence that the corona contains some of\nthe missing baryons; non-detection of the B-mode signal would provide an upper limit on the anisotropy of\nthe corona. However the practical difficulties should not\nbe understated: reaching the \"cleaned lensing\" limit of\nClBB = 5.8 \u00d7 10\u22128 \u03bcK2 requires a detector sensitivity of\n0.25 \u03bcK arcmin, two orders of magnitude better than the\nupcoming Planck satellite [40]. It is also possible that the\nfrequency structure of the polarized foregrounds is sufficiently complicated that extraction of small large-angle\nB-mode signals becomes impractical. Finally it is possible that tensor perturbations, or some other source of\nfrequency-independent B-modes such as cosmic strings,\nare present and swamp the Galactic Thomson scattering\nsignal.\nFrom the perspective of CMB gravitational wave\nsearches, the Galactic Thomson scattering signal appears\nto be negligible for all except the most futuristic experiments. Part of the reason for this is the low value of\nthe local quadrupole C2T T , which is only \u223c 20% of the\n\u039bCDM expected value; if \u039bCDM is indeed correct, we are\nin this respect simply lucky. For the very futuristic ex-\n\nperiments, however, if a frequency-independent B-mode\nsignal were observed close to the detectability threshold,\nthen the interpretation as a gravitational wave source\nwould require that Thomson scattering in the local universe be robustly ruled out as the source. This would\nrequire significant improvement in our understanding of\nthe Galactic corona.\n\n[1] A. H. Guth, Phys. Rev. D 23, 347 (1981).\n[2] A. Linde, Phys. Lett. B 108, 389 (1982).\n[3] A.
