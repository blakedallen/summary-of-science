The Ising spin\nmodels pose intriguing theoretical problems because antiferromagnetic (AF) and ferromagnetic (FM) systems\nwith spin-1/2 have a gap in the excitation spectrum.\nTherefore they reveal an extremely rich behavior dominated by quantum effects. In particular, the spin-1/2\nIsing model in a transverse magnetic field (ITF) displays a pragmatic example of a quantum phase transition. Theoretically, the ITF problem is exactly solved1\nand found a phase transition at a finite value of the transverse magnetic field: hc . This is a quantum critical point\nand the phase transition is continuous in nature.\nThe antisymmetric spin exchange interactions between\nspins, known as the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, play an important role in physics of spin systems2,3 .\nThe DM interaction idea originated from the deviation of\nexperimental data from the theoretical predictions, based\non the Heisenberg spin Hamiltonians4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 .\nGenerally the DM interaction between two spins S1 , S2\ncan be written as D*(S1 \u00d7S2 ) with an axial DM vector D.\nIn actual systems, the direction of D vector is fixed by\nthe microscopic arrangement of atoms and orbitals. In a\nspin chain, the DM vector may vary both in direction and\nmagnitude. However, the symmetry arguments usually\nrule out most of possibilities and confine the theoretical\ndiscussion to two principal cases. The first one is the uniform DM interaction, D = constant over the system13\nand the second case is the staggered DM interaction14\nwith anti-parallel D on adjacent bonds. Since the DM\ninteraction is rather difficult to handle analytically, the\neffect of this interaction are only partially studied so far.\nIn this sense we study the Ising chain (FM) with DM interaction, that its Hamiltonian (by considering a periodic\n\nchain of N sites) is given by\nX\nX\nz\nD * (Sj \u00d7 Sj+1 ),\nSjz Sj+1\n+\nH=J\nj\n\n(1)\n\nj\n\nwhere Sj is spin-1/2 operator on the j-th site, and J >\n0 (J < 0) denotes the AF (FM) coupling constant. In\na very recent work, using the quantum renormalization\ngroup and numerical Lanczos methods, the ground state\nphase diagram of the AF Ising chain (J > 0) is studied15 .\nIt is shown that the ground state phase diagram consists\nof AF and spiral phases.\nBy considering uniform DM vector as D = D\u1e91, and\nij\u03c0\ndoing the rotation about z axis as Sj\u00b1 \u2192 Sj\u00b1 e\u00b1 2 , the\nHamiltonian is transformed to XXZ chain16,17 with an\nJ\nanisotropy parameter D\n, i.e.,\n\u0014\n\u0015\nX\nJ z z\ny y\nx x\ntr\n(Sj Sj+1 + Sj Sj+1 ) + Sj Sj+1 . (2)\nH =D\nD\nj\nThe XXZ chain model was solved by Bethe18 , and its\nground state phase diagram is well known19 . The Neel\nJ\nregime is governed by D\n> 1 and there is a gap in the\nJ\n\u2264 \u22121, the ground state is in\nexcitation spectrum. For D\nthe FM phase and there is a gap over the FM state. In\nJ\nthe region \u22121 < D\n\u2264 1, the ground state of the system\nis in the gapless Luttinger liquid (LL) phase. Thus, by\nincreasing the D value, the system undergoes a quantum\nphase transition from the gapped Neel (or FM) phase to\nthe gapless LL phase at the critical value Dc = J.\nIn this paper we study an Ising spin-1/2 chain with\nFM exchange (J < 0) and the uniform DM interaction\nusing the numerical and analytical approaches. In the\nforthcoming section, we apply the Lanczos method to\ndiagonalize numerically finite chain systems with lengths\nN = 8, 10, ..., 24. Using the exact diagonalization results,\nwe calculate the spin gap, magnetization and spin-spin\ncorrelations as a function of the DM interaction.

Based on the exact diagonalization results we\nobtain the ground-state magnetic phase diagram of the\nmodel. By taking the DM interaction as the control parameter we show that a metamagnetic phase transition,\ncan be observed in the 1D ferromagnetic Ising model. In\nsection III, the observed metamagnetic phase transition\nfrom the numerical lanczos method is confirmed by the\nanalyzing the results of the variational matrix product\nstates approach. Finally, we conclude and summarize\nour results in section IV.\nII.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nIn this section, to explore the nature of the spectrum\nand the quantum phase transition, we use the Lanczos\nmethod to diagonalize chains with length up to N = 24.\nWe have computed the three lowest energy eigenvalues of\nchains with FM exchange J = \u22121.0 and different values\nof the DM vector. To get the energies of the few lowest\neigenstates we consider chains with periodic boundary\nconditions. In Fig.1, we have presented results of these\ncalculations for the chain sizes N = 12, 16, 20. We define\nthe excitation gap as a gap to the first excited state. It\nexhibits that the energy spectrum is gapped at D = 0,\nwhile by increasing the D the energy gap decreases linearly and vanishes at Dc = |J| = 1.0. We got this critical\nvalue as an exact value since there was no finite size correction. In the region D < Dc , the difference between\nthe energy of the first excited state and the ground state\nenergy shows an universal linear decrease with increasing DM vector, which is independent on the chain length\n(within the used numerical accuracy). By increasing the\nDM vector for D > Dc , the gap opens again in finite\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\nN=16\nN=20\nN=24\n\n0.05\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nD\n\nFIG. 2: a) The spin structure factor S zz (q) as a function of q\nfor FM Ising chain with DM interaction (J = \u22121.0 and N =\n24). b) The spin structure factor S zz (q = 0) as a function of\nthe DM interaction D for FM Ising chain (J = \u22121.0) including\ndifferent chain lengths N = 16, 20, 24.\n\nchains, but by extrapolating finite size results to N \u2192 \u221e,\nwe found that there is no gap in the spectrum. That is\nin agreement with the transformed Hamiltonian results\n(Eq. 2). Hence there are two gapped and gapless phases\nin the ground state phase diagram.\nTo study the magnetic order of the ground state of\nthe system, we have implemented the Lanczos algorithm\non finite chains to calculate the lowest eigenstate. The\nsymmetry breaking cannot occur in finite size\nP systems,\nthus instead of the magnetization, M z = N1 j hSjz i, we\nfocus on the spin-spin correlation functions. The static\nspin structure factor at momentum q is defined as\n1 X iqn z z\ne hSj Sj+n i.\n(3)\nS zz (q) =\nN n\nIt is known that the spin structure factors give us deeper\ninsight into the characteristics of the ground state.

For D < Dc the spin structure factor, S zz (q = 0), is equal to the value 0.25, which\nshows that the ground state of the system is in the fully\npolarized FM phase. This quantity is independent of the\nchains size, therefore the value of the magnetization does\nnot change in the thermodynamic limit N \u2192 \u221e, and\nthe FM ordering is a true long range order in the region D < Dc . One of the most interesting predictions\nof this model is that the magnetization as a function of\nthe DM vector displays a jump for certain parameters. It\nmeans that the spontaneous magnetization, M z , remains\nat the saturation value in the region D < Dc . But at the\ncritical value D = Dc , the spontaneous magnetization\njumps to zero. A rapid increase (or discontinuity) at critical value of the control parameter in the magnetization\ncurve is called the metamagnetic phase transition20,21 .\nThis phenomena that observed in the ground state phase\ndiagram of the 1D frustrated FM Heisenberg model22,23 ,\nhas defined the phase transition between the FM and AF\nphases. Surprisingly, however, we find that the metamagnetic phase transition can be observed between the FM\nand spiral phases in the 1D ferromagnetic spin-1/2 Ising\nmodel with DM interaction. In following we draw a simple physical picture for this phenomena.\nThe wave function of the ground state in the absence\nof the DM interaction has a form |\u03c8GS i = | \u2191\u2191\u2191\u2191 ...i.

Inset shows the\nspiral correlation function, C z , as a function of the 1/N for\ndifferent values of the DM vector: D = 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5.\n\nD-dependency of the spin structure factor, S zz (q = 0),\nis qualitatively the same as the uniform magnetization,\nM z.\nIn Fig.2(a) we have plotted the spin structure factor,\nS zz (q), as a function of momentum q for a chain with\nlength N = 24 and different values of the DM vector\nin the region D < Dc . We found that in this region\nthe function S zz (q) is independent of the value of D. It\nshows that S zz (q) has a very sharp peak at q = 0, corresponds to the FM ordering. On the other hand, there\nis not any peak in the region D > Dc which confirms\nthat all spins should aline in the xy plane. In Fig.2(b),\n\nwhich shows that in the presence of a DM interaction the\nground state is fully polarized and does not change up to\nthe critical value, Dc . The system is fully FM in 0 \u2264 D <\nDc , and lies in the subspace Stot = N/2 with two-times\ndegeneracy. But it becomes an incommensurate state for\nD > Dc , where the energy gap is strongly suppressed.\nAt the critical point, two distinct configurations with the\nenergy EGS = \u2212 41 N |J| are the ground states, where one\nis fully polarized in z direction. In Fig.3, we have plotted\nthe Lanczos results on the ground state energy per sites\nas a function of D for the chain lengths N = 12, 16, 20.\nAs we expected in the region of D < Dc the energy per\nspin of the ground state has the constant value \u22120.25 and\nindependent of the DM interaction (EGS /N = \u2212|J|/4).\nOn the other hand, we have also computed numerically\nthe transverse spin structure factors (S xx (q), S yy (q)) for\ndifferent values of DM vector. Due to symmetry S xx (q)\nis the same as S yy (q). We found that for the values\nof the DM vector D < Dc , S xx (q) = S yy (q) = 0 in\nwell agreement with the saturated ferromagnetic phase\nin the z direction. In the region D > Dc , the transverse\nspin structures showed two peaks at q = \u03c02 , 3\u03c0\n2 , which\nis a justification of the spiral order15 . It is showed that\nthe DM interaction can induce the spiral phase in the\nground state phase diagram of the spin systems24 , which\n\n\fis characterized by the nonzero value of the spirality\n1 X\nh(Sj \u00d7 Sj+1 )z i.\n(5)\n\u03c7z =\nN j\n\nCz =\n\nN\nX\n\n-0.25\n\n-0.3\nMz\n\nOne should note that there are two different types of the\nspiral ordered phases, gapped and gapless25,26 . Therefore, the definition of the spiral correlation function as\n\nEGS\n\n4\n\nh\u03c7zj \u03c7zj+n i,\n\n0.5\n\n(6)\n\nn=1\n0.25\n\n-0.35\n\nprovides further insight into the nature of different\nphases. In Fig.4, we have presented results of these\ncalculations for Ising chains with different lengths N =\n16, 20, 24. In complete agreement on the results of magnetization, the spirality in the FM Ising chain shows\na plateau in zero value at D < Dc . Which confirms\nthat there is no spiral long range order in the mentioned\nregime and the ground state is in the saturated FM phase.\nThe spirality remains close to zero value in the region\nD < Dc , but at the critical point, it jumps to a non-zero\nvalue.

The inset of the Fig.4, shows the spiral correlation function, C z , as a function of the 1/N for\ndifferent values of the DM vector.

Using the analytical and numerical approaches, we have shown that there are two different phases in the zero-temperature phase diagram of\nthe model. To provide a physical picture of the ground\nstate phase diagram of the model, by a redefinition of\nthe spin variables the model is mapped onto an XXZ\nHeisenberg chain. Where the anisotropy parameter is related to the DM vector, and identified a commensurateincommensurate (C-IC) quantum phase transition between the gapped and gapless phases. The numerical\nexperiment with high accuracy, has shown that in the\nground state phase diagram of the FM chain with DM\ninteraction, there is only one fully polarized FM phase\nbelow the critical value: Dc = |J|. However at the critical value, a metamagnetic phase transition occurs to the\nspiral gapless phase. Moreover, we used a variational\nmethod for evaluating ground state energy. By considering 1D simple matrix product state, the zero temperature\nenergy diagram of the ferromagnetic Ising chain with DM\ninteraction has been obtained.

In principle, the ground\nstate phase diagram of the FM chain consists of two\nphases which are gapped and gapless. In the case of\nFM chains, for D < Dc , there is only one saturated FM\nphase and at the critical value, Dc , a metamagnetic phase\ntransition occurs to the spiral phase.\n\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nIt is our pleasure to thank T.
