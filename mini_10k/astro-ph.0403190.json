In these systems we can probe the nature of star\nformation and observe its direct impacts on the ISM. Furthermore, the smaller scales of dwarf\nsystems allow us to address the global impacts of starbursts on the ISM, and in relatively\nhigh-luminosity cases, the effects on the surrounding IGM as well. In these systems we can\nattempt to ascertain the triggering mechanisms of starbursts in low-mass galaxies, which will\nbe an important component of models of the chemical and dynamical evolution of galaxies.\nAs a result of the relative paucity of strong starbursting dwarf galaxies in the local\nvolume, there are few detailed studies of the neutral gas kinematics of such systems. Kobulnicky & Skillman (1995) found the surprising result that in the well-studied dwarf starburst\nNGC 5253, the large-scale rotation of the galaxy appears to align along the galaxy's optical\nmajor axis. This rare kinematic alignment may be the signature of recent tidal interaction\nand may provide evidence for a triggered starburst in this system. A more clear case of a\ntriggered starburst is found in NGC 1569. Stil & Israel (2002) find that a low-mass companion seems to be interacting with the system, and that large amounts of the total H i mass\nare present at unusually high velocities with respect to systemic. These data suggest that\ninfall/outflow and/or tidal effects may be important for this system, and that the current\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nstarburst may present a case of triggered star formation. This burst is having a dramatic\neffect on the ISM, as turbulent motions appear to support the inner disk, and the mean\nvelocity dispersion is high (\u03c3V \u223c 20 km s\u22121 ) compared to other starbursts.\nNot all starbursts in low-mass galaxies appear to be tidally induced, however. In\nNGC 1705, well-known because of its spectacular galactic wind, the global H i kinematics\nappear to be quite regular (Meurer, Staveley-Smith, & Killeen 1998). While high-velocity\nH i gas does exist, the kinematics suggest simple rotation and a relatively quiescent velocity field. These few local blue compact dwarfs (BCD's) support the conclusions of Taylor\n(1997), wherein it was found that \u223c 60% of such systems harbor nearby H i companions\nthat may have triggered the current starbursts. However, the local sample also suggests that\nthere must exist another mechanism with which to initiate powerful starbursts in low-mass\ngalaxies. In this investigation we will examine the neutral gas properties of the nearby dwarf\nstarburst galaxy NGC 625, with one of the primary goals being to discern the nature of the\ntriggering mechanism of the current starburst.\nThe ejection of material from galaxies (i.e., \"blowout\") is a topic of great importance\nfor their overall evolution. In systems of decreasing total mass, temporally and spatially\nconcentrated massive star formation becomes increasingly important. For the lowest mass\ngalaxies, \"starbursts\" can dominate the energetics and luminosity of the system (Dekel & Silk\n1986; De Young & Heckman 1994). Such events can also affect their immediate surroundings\nby injecting energy into the ISM. If the energies are high enough, they can eventually break\nout of the disk and into the halo, releasing hot gas and processed material which may or may\nnot escape the system entirely to join the surrounding IGM. Numerical simulations of mass\nloss in low-mass systems (e.g., Mac Low & Ferrara 1999) suggest that it is quite difficult to\n7\nremove substantial fractions (i.e., >\n\u223c 10%) of the ISM in galaxies with masses >\n\u223c 10 M\u2299 .\nThus it is useful to examine the kinematics of gas in low-mass systems where this model can\nbe empirically tested. As will be discussed below, these observations add NGC 625 to the\nshort list of dwarf systems where neutral gas outflow has been detected.\nNGC 625 is an intriguing starburst system located on the far side of the nearby Sculptor\nGroup (D = 3.89\u00b1 0.22 Mpc; Cannon et al. 2003). In that investigation, HST/WFPC2\nphotometry was used to construct dereddened V vs. (V\u2212I) color-magnitude diagrams. It\nwas found that NGC 625 has been undergoing a prolonged (\u223c 100 Myr) starburst episode.\nThe spatially resolved nature of those data also allowed us to show that the recent star\nformation has been widespread throughout the central regions. Comparing the locations\nof young stars with the smooth distribution of older red giant stars, it is likely that star\nformation has been active for an even longer period. This is one of only a few cases where\nan extended burst of star formation has been observed in a nearby dwarf galaxy. The\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ncontributing factors to such an evolutionary scenario are not yet fully understood, but the\nneutral gas dynamics offer us a second avenue with which to investigate the recent evolution\nof this system.\nPrevious H i observations of NGC 625 were presented by C\u00f4t\u00e9, Carignan, & Freeman\n(2000). They identified multiple emission peaks in the central regions of the galaxy and\nrotation about the galaxy's optical major axis (as opposed to the typical rotation about the\nminor axis). The complex kinematics precluded the derivation of a mass model or a rotation\ncurve for this system and prompted the present investigation. As the cause for the complex\nneutral gas kinematics, C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. (2000) suggest a merger scenario - perhaps with a large H i\ncloud (which are numerous in this region of the sky, although mostly at differing velocities;\nsee Putman et al. 2002). In a study of the ionized gas kinematics, however, Marlowe et al.\n(1997) also find complex orbits and motions, suggestive of a major merger as the cause of\nthe burst. The possibility does exist, interestingly, that the kinematics of the ionized and\nneutral gas are caused by the current burst itself; i.e., perhaps the disk of this system is\nbeing disrupted by the strong and extended star formation episode. With these H i data,\nwe seek to further constrain the nature of the recent activity in this system.\nOther investigations also point toward the importance of NGC 625 as a nearby example\nof the dwarf starburst phenomenon. The spectroscopic investigation of Skillman, C\u00f4t\u00e9, &\nMiller (2003b) finds strong, broad (5.5 \u00c5 EW) \u03bb 4686 \u00c5 emission arising from the largest\nH ii region, suggesting a Wolf\u2212Rayet (W\u2212R) classification for the current burst (Conti 1991)\nand an age of 4\u22126 Myr. This result is somewhat surprising, given the extended nature of\nthe burst derived in Cannon et al. (2003), and suggests that the presence of W\u2212R features\ndoes not necessarily imply a young (< 6 Myr) burst. Skillman, C\u00f4t\u00e9, & Miller (2003a) find\na current star formation rate of 0.05 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , comparable to the values found in other highluminosity dwarf starburst systems. Bomans & Grant (1998) find diffuse 0.1\u22122.4 keV x-ray\nemission coincident with the large H ii region and extended above the northern side of the\nplane, suggesting that a galactic wind has been active or has recently terminated. The above\nproperties imply that the recent star formation has been intense in NGC 625; the evolution\nof this system has been complex and offers an ideal opportunity to study many important\nquestions about the starburst phase of dwarf galaxy evolution. We therefore have begun a\nmultiwavelength study of this system, of which these H i observations form an important\npart.\nFor reference, in Table 1 we summarize basic observational properties of this system.\nWe organize this paper as follows. In \u00a7 2 we discuss the data obtained and our reductions.\nThe H i data and its analysis, our interpretations, and a simple model are discussed in \u00a7 3. In\n\u00a7 4 we discuss the strong radio continuum emission detected from the three highest-surface\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nbrightness H ii regions, and \u00a7 5 summarizes our conclusions.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Data Reduction\n\nWe obtained Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA)1 synthesis imaging, utilizing a\nnumber of arrays, between 2001 May and 2001 December (see Table 2) for program C968. In\ntotal, 75.3 hours were spent on source, with 83 independent baselines sampling UV distances\nbetween 0.139 and 27.1 k\u03bb. The data were acquired with a correlator configuration that yields\ntwo independent datasets: broadband continuum data with total bandwidth of 128 MHz,\ncentered at 1384 MHz, and narrowband spectral line data with 1024 channels, each with an\nunsmoothed velocity resolution of 0.8 km s\u22121 . For the latter, the central observing frequency\nwas 1419 MHz, corresponding to a velocity of 297 km s\u22121 . The heliocentric systemic velocity\nof NGC 625, 413\u00b15 km s\u22121 , corresponds to a frequency of 1418.5 MHz, and thus falls near\nthe center of our spectral observing frequency band. Reductions of each of these datasets\nfollowed the standard format, using the MIRIAD2 package; we briefly summarize the data\nhandling below.\nFor the continuum observations, interference and bad data were first removed from the\nUV data. Observations performed with the sun above the horizon were discarded. Bandpass,\nflux, gain and phase calibrations were then applied, derived from observations of PKS 1934638 (primary calibrator) and PKS 0201-440 or PKS 0104-408 (secondary calibrators). The\ncalibrated UV data were then imaged and cleaned to produce the continuum map. The\nresulting image, produced using natural weighting, is discussed further in \u00a7 4. The beam\nsize is 6.8\u2032\u2032 \u00d74.8\u2032\u2032 , and the rms noise is 38 \u03bcJy Beam\u22121 . This noise level provides sensitivity\nto the highest surface brightness H ii regions in NGC 625, and we unambiguously detect all\nthree of these sources.\nThe reduction of the spectral line data is similar to that of the continuum. Imaging\nproduces two spectral cubes for analysis, one of high (\u223c 22.5\u2032\u2032 ) and one of low (\u223c 45\u2032\u2032 )\nresolution, both produced using tapered uniform weighting, and Hanning smoothed to 2.5\nkm s\u22121 velocity resolution. The former will be used to discern the small-scale structure of\nthe high-column density neutral gas, while the latter maximizes our sensitivity to largescale structure. In the former cube, a typical line-free single-plane rms noise value is 1.1\nmJy Beam\u22121 (1.55 K), while in the latter it is 2.3 mJy Beam\u22121 (0.85 K).

At the\nresolution available, the H i in NGC 625 aligns well with the optical galaxy with a low column\ndensity extension toward the northwest (also seen in C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. 2000). These observations\ndetect H i to more than 6 optical scale lengths (33\u2032\u2032 ; Marlowe et al. 1997). While this is\nsmaller than the extent of the large H i halos seen in some dwarf galaxies (e.g., NGC 4449,\nBajaja, Huchtmeier, & Klein 1994; Hunter et al. 1998), the total H i envelope is comparable\nin size to those of the dwarf and low-surface brightness galaxies in the samples of van Zee\net al. (1997) and C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. (2000).\nBecause the H i distribution ellipticity and orientation agree with those of the optical\ndistribution, one expects a velocity field typical for a dwarf galaxy (i.e., nearly solid-body\nrotation about the optical minor axis). However, as demonstrated by C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. (2000), the\nvelocity field for NGC 625 is anything but typical. We discuss the velocity structure in detail\nin \u00a7 3.2.\nFigure 2 presents zeroth-moment images at both low and high resolution. Both zeroth\nmoment images show a peak column density > 2\u00d71021 cm\u22122 . The main H i peak is not\ncoincident with the location of the current major star formation region, but rather is offset\nto the east by \u223c 300 pc. It is interesting to note that we detect a sizable high-column density\n(NH > 1021 cm\u22122 ) region in the disk. This suggests plentiful dense gas with which to sustain\nan extended burst of star formation, as was derived in Cannon et al. (2003).\nFrom the low-resolution data cube, we derive a total H i gas mass of (1.1\u00b10.2)\u00d7108 M\u2299 .\nWe note, however, that there exists significant (maximum AV = 0.57 mag.) and variable\n(differences of \u223c 0.2 mag. over physical scales of tens of parsecs) extinction in the disk\n(Cannon et al. 2003), and likely a sizable molecular gas reservoir (C\u00f4t\u00e9, Cannon, & Braine,\nin preparation), suggesting that the total gas mass is considerably higher than this value.\nThis mass measurement is in good agreement with that found in C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. (2000) after\ncorrecting for the new distance found in Cannon et al. (2003).\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n3.2.\n\nThe Disturbed H i Kinematics\n\nWe next examine the velocity structure of the H i gas in NGC 625. In Figure 3 we present\nindividual channel maps from the low-resolution cube. At multiple velocities, the H i gas is\nmulti-peaked, and in some cases (most notably 429.8 km s\u22121 ) even forms spatially distinct\nstructures at this sensitivity level. Indeed, as will be argued below, this system appears\nmuch more complex in velocity space than the initial distribution and column density images\n(Figures 1 & 2) would suggest.\nA closer examination of the channel maps in Figure 3 shows that NGC 625 is undergoing\nsolid-body rotation about its optical minor axis (i.e., as expected for an inclined rotating\ndisk). However, superposed on this disk are a complex variety of kinematic structures that\nmake the interpretation of the velocity field difficult. Some of this structure (especially at\nhigh velocities with respect to systemic) makes the first moment images (see below) appear\nto contain a component of rotation about the galaxy's optical minor axis. This unusual\nbehavior, initially posited by C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. (2000), appears to be the result of the superposition\nof multiple velocity components along the line of sight and not the result of actual rotation\nabout the optical minor axis.\nThe first moment images (representing intensity-weighted velocity field) are shown in\nFigure 4. In the low-resolution image, it is clear that many velocity components have been\naveraged together along the line of sight to form the column density images shown previously.\nNote in particular the high-velocity gas seen both above and below the H i major axis and\nthe lower-velocity gas seen on both sides of the optical center. The high-resolution velocity\nfield only provides information on the highest-column density H i gas, but there does appear\nto be agreement in the velocity structure in the regions detected in both the low- and highresolution velocity fields. Furthermore, solid-body rotation appears to be evident in both\ncubes, and the high-resolution velocity field shows the central regions less confused with the\nhigh-velocity gas above and below the disk as seen in the lower-resolution cube. This very\nconfused velocity structure warrants a further investigation of the nature of the H i emission\nat all velocities.\nIn Figure 5 we present five position-velocity cuts along the direction of the optical major\naxis (position angle = 90\u25e6 , width = 3\u2032\u2032 ). One is centered on the H i column density peak,\ntwo at \u00b1 30\u2032\u2032 , and two at \u00b1 60\u2032\u2032 north and south of this position (note in Figure 1 the five\nwhite lines, which denote the center of each of these PV cuts). Each PV cut is separated\nby nearly a full beam width. In each section of the figure, note the clear multi-component\nemission seen at different positions along the cut.\nBeginning with the cut through the H i column density maximum (Figure 5c), note\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nthe prominent detection of gas at nearly the full range of velocities (360 \u2212 460 km s\u22121 )\nwhich is coincident with the main body of the galaxy (i.e., within 1\u2032 of the central location,\nand within the optical extent of the system). There is an identifiable, very steep velocity\ngradient (increasing velocities from negative to positive offsets), which on first inspection\nmight be interpreted as the signature of solid-body rotation of at least part of the H i disk.\nHowever, two lines of evidence argue against this. First, under the assumption that this disk\nis rotationally supported, the implied central mass is > 4\u00d7108 M\u2299 ; i.e., much larger than the\nkinematic mass of the system (see further discussion in \u00a7\u00a7 3.3.1, 3.3.3). Second, and more\nimportantly, the fact that there exists H i at such a wide range of velocities in the central\nregion argues for a highly turbulent disk; this may be a result of the extended and intense\nstar formation event which this system has undergone, depositing energy throughout the\ndisk without the creation of a single massive evacuated cavity as a result. We make further\nprojections on the nature of this gas in the following section. The confused nature of the H i\ngas in the central regions prevents us from deriving an unambiguous rotation curve for this\nsystem.\nNext, note the clear detection of two kinematically distinct features in all five PV\ndiagrams, reaching > \u00b1 2\u2032 from the central position. There is a clear velocity discontinuity\nat an angular offset of \u22121\u2032 , where a change of nearly 100 km s\u22121 occurs in a very short\ndistance. Similarly, a velocity discontinuity is apparent at an angular offset of + 1\u2032 . The\nsymmetry of these features suggests that these are parts of the regularly-rotating H i disk\nof NGC 625. The high and low-velocity gas both north and south of the central component\nappears to be superposed on this apparently solid-body rotating component.\nThe unprecedented structure evident in these PV cuts is a kinematic signature consistent\nwith active blowout of neutral gas from the disk of NGC 625. The presence of H i gas at\nall velocities in the central sections of the galaxy suggests that large amounts of energy\nhave been deposited into the ISM of this system. Some of the most conspicuous structure\nis present in the velocity region 430 \u2212 450 km s\u22121 , as seen in the panels of Figure 3. This\nhigh-velocity gas appears both above and below the optical extent of the system and provides\nstrong evidence for outflow behavior (see \u00a7 3.3 for further discussion).\nWhile the strongest tracer of blowout is usually H\u03b1 kinematics, this study adds NGC 625\nto the short list of systems where H i blowout is unambiguously detected (see also the Ott\net al. 2001 study of Ho-I). Certainly violent star formation has played a role in the evolution\nof similar systems [e.g., the SMC, Stanimirovic et al. 1999; Ho-II, Puche et al. 1992 (but see\nalso Bureau & Carignan 2002); NGC 1569, Stil & Israel 2002; NGC 1705, Meurer et al. 1998].\nWhile we do not see the small-scale effects of active star formation on the ISM as clearly\nin NGC 625 as in these other systems (e.g., no clear cases of evacuated shells or chimneys),\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nit is clear that the current active star formation has had a dramatic effect on the ISM. As\nwe argue in the following section, we interpret this kinematic signature as active blowout\nof large amounts of H i gas from the disk of NGC 625. This blowout may be the result of\nthe spatially and temporally extended star formation episode which NGC 625 has undergone\nin the last 100 Myr. Higher-resolution H i imaging would likely show that the active star\nformation is in the process of evacuating small areas of the ISM. In the next section we\nconsider various interpretations of these PV diagrams.\n\n3.3.\n\nPossible Kinematic Models for NGC 625\n\nHere we consider a large range of possible interpretations of the disturbed kinematics in\nNGC 625. In the end, we find that blowout superposed against a disk in nearly solid-body\nrotation is the only model which successfully reproduces all of the characteristics of the\nobservations. While these data are not of sufficient resolution to detect the small-scale (e.g.,\n< 100 pc) features of the ISM (where many H i holes and other features may be found),\nthey are more than adequate to examine the nature of the large-scale H i features which are\nassociated with this putative blowout model.\n\n3.3.1. A Simple Rotating Disk\nAs noted above, the general kinematics of the H i in NGC 625 are consistent with a\nslowly rotating dwarf galaxy, observed at a relatively high inclination. As seen in Figure 3,\nthe channel maps are consistent with an H i disk that retains strong components of rotation\nabout the galaxy's optical minor axis. However, superposed on this simple disk model are\ncomplicated velocity components that indicate a highly irregular integrated velocity field,\nand neutral gas at nearly all detected velocities within the H i disk. As can be seen in\nFigure 5, the simple solid-body behavior is prominent from \u22122\u2032 to +2\u2032 ; however, in the\ninner \u00b1 1\u2032 , the superposition of velocity components interrupts this simple model of the\nH i distribution. Therefore, these observations are not consistent with only a simple H i\ndisk in solid-body rotation. Rather, a more complicated model is required to explain the\nobservations.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n3.3.2. Blowout Plus Rotation\nThe disk of NGC 625 is seen nearly edge-on. From our HST/WFPC2 observations, the\noptical axis shows an inclination of 69\u25e6 (Cannon et al. 2003). Since we cannot unambiguously\nderive a rotation curve, we cannot derive a precise value for the inclination of the galaxy\nusing these H i data alone. However, using elliptical fits to H i column density contours\nsuggests an inclination of (65\u00b15)\u25e6 . For the purposes of this simple model, we adopt the\nvalue of 65\u25e6 as the inclination of the disk.\nLet us assume a \"standard\" conical blowout emanating from the center of the H i disk\n(Mac Low, McCray, & Norman 1989; Mac Low & Ferrara 1999). This blowout will push\nneutral gas preferentially in the direction of lowest pressure; i.e., directly out of the disk\n(N/S in the case of NGC 625). Assuming this gas breaks out of the H i disk (which should\nbe in solid-body rotation), it will then allow hot gas and metals to be vented into the galactic\nhalo.\nIn a major-axis position-velocity slice, this scenario will appear similar to Figure 5.\nMore explicitly, the expected solid-body rotation of the H i disk will appear as a diagonal\nfeature, from low velocities and large separation on one side of the disk, to high velocities\nand large separation on the opposite side of the disk. Superposed on this will be gas of all\nvelocities near the location of the galactic wind center; i.e., at the location of the starburst,\nwe expect to see gas of all velocities, since in a conical blowout model, there will exist some\ncomponent of velocity along our line of sight from all 360\u25e6 of the expanding material.\nBy observing position-velocity diagrams at varying distances from the central disk (here,\nat different declinations), we should see the solid-body component decrease in strength, while\nthe gas above and below the disk should remain prominent. This is caused by two factors.\nFirst, the disk itself is of finite thickness. Thus, the further the distance from the main H i\ndisk, the less neutral gas is involved with the total system rotation. Second, the gas which\nis being pushed out of the disk should remain visible until the scale height of the blowout.\nOnce this position is reached, the intensity in these features should quickly decrease.\nEach of the main points of the blowout scenario is observed in Figure 5. Furthermore,\nwe note that our measure of the inclination is consistent with more H i above the disk than\nbelow (compare high and low velocities in the central region cut, and high and low velocities\nbetween the + 60\u2032\u2032 and \u2212 60\u2032\u2032 cuts). Thus this series of PV diagrams appears to be consistent\nwith a simple picture of a normal dwarf galaxy H i disk, highly inclined with respect to the\nline of sight, with an internal wind that is causing some of the H i gas to be vented both\nabove and below the plane (with more prominent emission above than below the disk).\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n3.3.3. Superposed or Counter-Rotating Disks\nSuperposed disks (a kinematically distinct small disk rotating in the same sense as a\nlarger disk) have the potential to reproduce the main features of the PV diagram. Here,\na large, rotating halo will produce the H i gas detected between \u22122\u2032 and +2\u2032 in the PV\ndiagram. Superposed on this will be a second component, rotating in the same sense and\nthus appearing in a similar orientation in the PV diagram. Depending on the difference in\nmass and rotation speed, the position angle of these two components will vary in the PV\ndiagram. Thus, this model appears to be able to describe the observed PV diagrams.\nUpon a closer inspection of Figure 5, however, we can eliminate this possibility because\nof the size of the components needed. In order to reproduce the observed PV diagram\nthe enclosed mass in the smaller central component would have to be > 4\u00d7 108 M\u2299 . This\ngreatly exceeds the masses within the inner 1 kpc found consistently in dwarfs and irregulars,\nbased on mass models of their rotation curves that include gas, stellar and dark matter\ncontributions (e.g., C\u00f4t\u00e9 1995).\nThe observed PV diagrams are also inconsistent with a counter-rotating disk (e.g., as\nseen in NGC 4449, Bajaja et al. 1994; Hunter et al. 1998). There, the orientation of the two\ncomponents (disk and halo) must be in the opposite sense in a major-axis PV diagram; i.e.,\nthe direction of increasing velocity for one must be the direction of decreasing velocity for the\nother. This is opposite to what is observed. Only disks rotating in the same direction can\nproduce the arrangement of features seen in our PV diagram; however, as discussed above,\nthis can only occur with unphysically large central mass concentrations in this low-mass\nsystem.\n\n3.3.4. Infall\nIn most galaxies it is impossible to distinguish between infall and outflow. If NGC 625\nis currently accreting material from a diffuse halo or neighboring H i cloud, this gas could\nappear as the high-velocity gas near the main H i disk. However, the symmetry of the\nNGC 625 system is better explained in the context of outflow. If infall were taking place, we\nwould expect to see more gas on one side of a system than the other (e.g., as would result\nfrom a merger or from the accretion of a gas cloud). The high-velocity gas (with respect to\nsystemic) seen both above and below the central regions of NGC 625 is more likely exiting the\nsystem; because symmetric infall is very rare, this scenario will have difficulty in explaining\nthe observed PV diagrams and velocity field.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n3.3.5. \"Ongoing Assimilation\"\nSome nearby dwarf irregular galaxies are known to have very extended H i structures\nwith complex kinematics (e.g., IC 10, Shostak & Skillman 1989, Wilcots & Miller 1998;\nNGC 4449, Hunter et al. 1998). Hunter et al. (1998) invented the phrase \"ongoing assimilation\" to present a scenario which best describes their present status. In that investigation,\nlarge \"streamers\" of H i gas, highly structured and extending away from the main disk of\nthe galaxy, were posited to be primordial inhomogeneities in the gas cloud surrounding the\nsystem that are currently being incorporated into the galaxy. Such a delayed formation\nscenario had been suggested theoretically (Silk, Wyse, & Shields 1987), and the presence of\nconsiderable amounts of diffuse gas in the NGC 4449 halo lends credence to this scenario.\nSuch a scenario presents an alternative interpretation of these H i observations of\nNGC 625. Evidence for ongoing assimilation comes from the large amount of diffuse H i\nsurrounding the main galaxy. However, this scenario is not able to explain the complicated velocity structure seen in Figure 5 for two reasons. First, there is no coherent spatial\nstructure in the diffuse H i gas surrounding the galaxy, as seen in NGC 4449. This implies\nthat there has been no \"trigger\" for the assimilation of the material (which should produce\nasymmetric structure on large scales), and that we have caught this system in a rare case\nof activity. Second, and more importantly, the high-velocity gas is seen comparatively close\nto the main disk of the galaxy, suggesting its energy source is nearby. Unlike NGC 4449,\nwhere structures remain coherent in velocity for \u223c 200 km s\u22121 and spatially over scales of \u223c\n100 kpc, the H i in NGC 625 is confined to within \u223c 50 km s\u22121 of systemic and to within \u223c\n2.5 kpc of the optical center of the system. Taken together, these points argue that such a\nscenario likely cannot explain the structures seen in Figure 5.\n\n3.3.6. Superposed Anomalous-Velocity Clouds\nA chance superposition of two anomalous-velocity clouds could potentially explain the\ncomplicated PV diagrams. Indeed, there exist many H i clouds coincident with the Sculptor\nGroup; however, they display a wide velocity dispersion about the systemic velocity of the\ngroup, and none are coincident in both position and velocity with NGC 625 (see Putman\net al. 2002). While there is a chance that two small clouds have escaped detection in the\ncompilation of Putman et al. (2002), it appears that a chance superposition of two major H i\nclouds is an unlikely scenario with which to explain the PV diagrams.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n3.3.7. ISM Turbulence\nThe observed PV diagrams are inconsistent with those expected from a highly turbulent\nISM. While there certainly are turbulent processes at work in any area of massive star\nformation and evolution, it is highly unlikely that such random processes could produce the\nsymmetrical distribution of high-velocity gas near the center of the galaxy. If turbulence\nwere the cause of the high-velocity gas, it would need to remain coherent over spatial scales\nexceeding a kiloparsec (i.e., the separation between the central PV cut and the cuts at \u00b1\n60\u2032\u2032 ). Thus, while turbulence likely has a hand in disturbing the small-scale structure of the\nISM in NGC 625, it is highly unlikely that it has produced the high-velocity gas north and\nsouth of the disk as seen in the PV diagrams.\n\n3.4.\n\nSimple Calculation of Burst Energetics\n\nWe interpret the complicated velocity structure in NGC 625 as the signature of H i\nblowout from the disk. However, at our resolution, we do not detect evacuated holes or\nshells in the disk that would support such a scenario. This implies either that we are\nwitnessing this blowout event relatively early in its evolution, or that the blowout is the\nresult of a continuous, widespread star formation event that has deposited sufficient energy\ninto the ISM to cause H i gas to be expelled into the halo. Given our recent star formation\nhistory analysis (see Cannon et al. 2003), we suggest the second scenario is more likely.\nBased on the results presented in Cannon et al. (2003), we can estimate the mechanical\nenergy input into the ISM from the recent extended star formation event. In that investigation the authors found a high, but declining, star formation rate over at least the last 100\nMyr. More specifically, the average star formation rates over the coarse age bins 0-25 Myr,\n25-50 Myr, and 50-100 Myr were found to be 0.008, 0.01 and 0.04 M\u2299 *yr\u22121 , respectively.\nUsing these star formation rates, and assuming an IMF, we can estimate the number of SNe\nthat have exploded thus far in this extended star formation event. In particular, we assume\na Salpeter IMF, and that all stars above 8 M\u2299 explode as SNe, each depositing an average\nof 1051 erg of mechanical energy into the surrounding ISM (Burrows 2000).\nThe results of this simple model suggest that the recent star formation in NGC 625 has\ndeposited \u223c 1055 erg of energy in the last 100 Myr. If the total mass of NGC 625 is \u223c 109\nM\u2299 , and a scale height of \u223c 1 kpc is assumed (roughly the separation between the major H ii\nregion and the extent of diffuse x-ray emission; Bomans & Grant 1998), then this amount of\nenergy is comparable to the total gravitational binding energy of the system. Thus the fact\nthat we see kinematic evidence for blowout should not be surprising.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nA calculation of the mass of outflowing material is not straightforward. That is, there is\nno clear kinematic separation between outflowing components and stationary gas within the\ndisk. Rather, it appears that we are viewing a superposition of gas at many velocities along\nthe same line of sight, making it difficult to accurately disentangle gas that is outflowing\nfrom gas that is stationary within the disk. However, simple calculations suggest that there\nhas been sufficient energy deposited into the ISM to accelerate a substantial fraction of the\nneutral gas in this system, with sensible assumptions about the efficiency of mechanical\nenergy deposition. For example, assuming a 20% efficiency for mechanical energy conversion\nfrom input SNe energy and a total baryonic mass of \u223c 109 M\u2299 (although note that the dark\nmatter content remains unconstrained from these observations), \u223c 20% of the H i mass (or\n2.2\u00d7107 M\u2299 ) could be moved roughly 1 kpc above the disk. Note that a larger dark matter\ncontent will decrease the fraction of the H i mass that could be accelerated. Regardless of\nthe mass of material that is currently outflowing, the energetics are more than adequate to\naccount for an outflow scenario.\n\n3.5.\n\nA Simple Case of Blowout?\n\nAs discussed above, we interpret the complex velocity structure in NGC 625 as the\nsignature of blowout, superposed on a normal disk that is undergoing solid-body rotation.\nThis simple scenario offers the best description of the observed PV diagrams. Furthermore,\nit has been argued that other interpretations of the data have shortcomings that preclude\nthem from accurately reproducing the PV structures.\nWe note that this interpretation is consistent with other observations of NGC 625. First,\nusing the luminous blue helium burning stars, in Cannon et al. (2003) we derived a recent\nstar formation history where sustained high star formation rates have been maintained for at\nleast the last 100 Myr. While spectroscopic W\u2212R features suggest a much shorter duration\nfor the current burst, the high H i column density shown throughout much of the central disk,\nand the movement of star formation throughout the disk found in the HST data, suggest\nthat the star formation in this system has been widespread throughout the disk, rather than\nconfined to the location of the current major burst. The 100 Myr timescale would allow large\namounts of energy to be put into the ISM, without necessarily leaving one large evacuated\ncavity which would be detectable at our current resolution. Regardless, we know that there\nhas been an extended period of star formation in NGC 625.\nSecond, Bomans & Grant (1998) find diffuse soft x-ray emission above the northern\nside of the disk. This gas shows two x-ray peaks, separated by more than 1\u2032 . Based on the\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\npointing accuracies of ROSAT3 , we can be sure that this x-ray emission is located in the\nnortheastern halo of the galaxy, and potentially coincident with the disk as well. Given the\ninclination and the orientation of the outflow which we infer from the PV diagrams, such hot\ngas (T \u223c 106 K) would be preferentially seen on the northern side of the disk, i.e., exactly\nwhere the diffuse gas is detected. For this hot gas to reach the large distances above the\ndisk where it is seen, an active outflow must have cleared the way for the hot gas to escape.\nIt is possible that the two x-ray peaks correspond to two separate outflow occurrences.\nFinally, Skillman et al. (2003a) find chimney-like H\u03b1 filaments extending radially upward\nfrom the galaxy on the northern side (see regions 11 & 12 of their Figure 1). This is exactly\nwhat is expected for a blowout scenario, where such chimneys trace the path of hot gas\noutflow into the halo of the galaxy (Heiles 1993). These low-surface brightness features are\nclear indicators that a low-density region must have been evacuated to allow unattenuated\nH\u03b1 emission to escape to large distances above the disk. Each of these points supports our\ninterpretation of the unusual velocity structure as the signature of blowout from the disk of\nNGC 625.\nComparing our observational results with the numerical simulations of mass loss in dwarf\ngalaxies in Mac Low & Ferrara (1999), we find good agreement. Our H i mass corresponds\nmost closely to the 108 M\u2299 model presented there. In \u00a7 3.4 we estimated the mechanical\nenergy input into the ISM by the recent star formation. The results suggest a scenario\ncomparable to the L38 = 1-10 models presented in Mac Low & Ferrara (1999). Examining\nthe gas distributions presented therein, we find that H i is to be expected tens of kpc above\nand below the disk of the system. Since our H i distribution is smaller than this, we posit\nthat the spatially widespread star formation derived in Cannon et al. (2003) has resulted\nin outflow, but has deposited this energy throughout the disk, rather than in one spatially\nconcentrated area. Further agreement is found with the x-ray and H\u03b1 emissivities presented\nin Mac Low & Ferrara (1999); the diffuse x-ray and H\u03b1 gas discussed above is consistent\nwith the results for this gas mass and energy input.\n\n4.\n\nThe Radio Continuum Emission and Extinction Toward the Starburst\n\nRadio continuum emission can be a useful probe of the physical conditions in active\nstar formation regions. In particular, the contribution of non-thermal sources can be identified based on the spectral index of the emission. Via comparison with recombination line\nintensities (e.g., H\u03b1, H\u03b2), one can attain a detailed measure of the reddening toward heavily3\n\nSee the online ROSAT Point Sources Catalogue, http://wgacat.gsfc.nasa.gov/wgacat/wgacat.html\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nobscured star formation regions that would otherwise be inaccessible at optical wavelengths.\nThe ATCA correlator allows concurrent H i and continuum studies of NGC 625. The\nbroadband continuum data, centered at 1384 MHz, allow a detailed look at the 20 cm radio\ncontinuum emission arising from the large H ii regions in NGC 625. As shown in Figure 6,\nwe detect strong radio continuum from the largest H ii regions (NGC 625 A, B, C of Cannon\net al. 2003). The spectroscopic W\u2212R features (Skillman et al. 2003b) arise from the strongest\nradio continuum source, which is coincident with H ii region NGC 625 A.\nThe total 1384 MHz flux densities from the major H ii regions (within apertures the\nsize of, or larger than, the beam) are given in Table 3. Note that H ii regions A and D\nare measured together; since the contribution of D to the combined flux is < 4%, this will\nnot affect the results presented here. Following Caplan & Deharveng (1986), for a thermal\ncontinuum source in the presence of no extinction, the H\u03b1 flux and the continuum flux at\n1384 MHz are related by:\n(8.658 \u00d7 10\u22129 )( 10T4 )\u22120.44\njH\u03b1\n=\nj1384\n(10.486 + 1.5 * ln( 10T4 ))\n\n(1)\n\nwhere jH\u03b1 is the flux at H\u03b1 in erg sec\u22121 cm\u22122 , j1384 is the flux density at 1384 MHz in Jy,\nand T is the electron temperature in K. From Skillman et al. (2003b) we adopt an electron\ntemperature for each H ii region, listed in Table 3 (note that their H ii regions NGC 5,\n9 and 18 correspond to NGC 625 A, B, C, respectively, of Cannon et al. 2003). For these\nH\u03b1\nratio between (7.15-8.04)\u00d710\u221210 erg sec\u22121 cm\u22122 Jy\u22121 , for\nparameters we then expect a jj1384\npurely thermal emission in the presence of no reddening.\nCombining the measured H ii region flux densities from the radio continuum with the\nmeasured flux of the H ii regions based on our previous HST narrowband photometry, we\nH\u03b1\nratio for each of the three most luminous H ii regions and use these\ncalculate the jj1384\nH\u03b1\nvalues to derive the implied AH\u03b1 . The low jj1384\nvalues for regions (A+D) and C suggest\nthat either appreciable amounts of extinction exist toward these starburst regions, or that\nthe contribution of non-thermal sources to the radio continuum luminosity is significant.\nIt is very common for AH\u03b1 calculated from the ratio of Balmer fluxes to radio continuum\nfluxes to be much larger than AH\u03b1,Balmer , even in the absence of nonthermal radio continuum\nemission (cf. Israel & Kennicutt 1980; Caplan & Deharveng 1986; Skillman & Israel 1986;\nBell et al. 2002). This arises simply because in non-homogeneous geometries AH\u03b1,Balmer can\nsaturate at values as low as 0.4 so that AH\u03b1,Balmer frequently is only a lower limit to the\ntrue extinction. Similar results were found by Beck, Turner, & Kovo (2000) for a sample of\nWolf-Rayet galaxies. As shown in Table 3, the extinction varies widely from one H ii region\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nH\u03b1\nto the next, with region B suffering no extinction as measured from the jj1384\nratio. If the\nlow ratios for regions (A+D) and C are caused by the presence of additional extinction, then\nthese results are consistent with results from both our HST/WFPC2 imaging and groundbased spectroscopy, where strong and variable extinction was found throughout the galaxy.\nIn the latter study, differential extinction precluded a detailed temporal resolution of the\nrecent star formation history.\n\nUnfortunately, with these data we only have one frequency with which to probe the\nradio continuum, precluding detailed spectral index work to reveal the contribution of potential non-thermal sources. Multi-frequency radio continuum observations of this system\nare underway (Cannon et al. 2004, in preparation), as they will help to further probe the\nnature of, and extinction toward, the H ii regions in this active dwarf galaxy. We can gain\nsome insight into this issue, however, by using the optical spectroscopy of Skillman et al.\n(2003b). The c(H\u03b2) values calculated therein are converted to AV and shown in Table 3.\nThe difference in implied extinctions between the optical (i.e., H\u03b1/H\u03b2) and the radio (i.e.,\nH\u03b1/radio continuum) suggests that the nonthermal contribution is large; however, multifrequency data will answer this question definitively. With the current data, we conclude\nthat the measured radio continuum luminosities, when compared to the observed Balmer\nline fluxes, are consistent with either heavy (and spatially variant) extinction toward some\nof the starburst regions (AH\u03b1 \u223c 1-2 mag), or the presence of a large non-thermal component\nof the radio continuum luminosity.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have presented new ATCA multi-configuration H i synthesis imaging of the nearby\ndwarf starburst galaxy NGC 625. The H i morphology appears smooth on global scales;\nlow-resolution column density images show one strong central H i peak surrounded by a\nmoderate-size low-density halo. However, examining the morphology at higher resolution\nreveals multiple peaks in the column density, suggesting that the dynamics of the neutral\ngas are quite complex.\nExamination of the velocity field shows a complicated structure, with H i emission\ndetected near the disk across the full velocity range. We find velocity structure in the H i\ndata cubes that appears consistent with the signature of neutral gas blowout from the main\ndisk. While at our resolution we are not sensitive to small-scale structure (which may show\nholes and other signatures of the influence of massive stars), we are sensitive to the global\neffects that this star formation is having on the ISM of NGC 625. Because we do not detect\nlarge H i holes, and given the results of our HST/WFPC2 star formation history analysis\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n(Cannon et al. 2003), we prefer the interpretation that the current outflow episode is not the\nresult of one major star formation region, but rather the collective influence of the extended\n(both temporally and spatially) star formation event which NGC 625 has undergone.\nActive blowout is the only interpretation that is capable of reproducing all of the characteristics of the position-velocity diagrams along the major axis of the system. Other potential\nexplanations of the complex velocity structure, including superposed disks, counter-rotating\ndisks, infall, ongoing assimilation, high-velocity clouds, and ISM turbulence, are discussed\nand rejected, each failing to reproduce all of the observed velocity structure. While a detailed hydrodynamical simulation is beyond the scope of this paper, we encourage further\nsuch investigations to better understand the mechanisms involved in creating blowout in\nlow-mass systems.\nAt the current sensitivity, we find no obvious external trigger for the current burst of\nstar formation. As NGC 625 is a comparatively isolated galaxy, we thus conclude that it has\nbeen able to sustain a heightened star formation rate due to the relatively large reservoir\nof high-column density gas in the central disk regions. The initial triggering mechanism for\nthis extended burst remains unknown.\nWe detect strong radio continuum emission from the three largest star formation regions\nin NGC 625. Comparing to our HST/WFPC2 H\u03b1 fluxes, we find that either appreciable\namounts of extinction exist toward these regions, or that there is a strong nonthermal component to the radio continuum emission. We have undertaken multi-frequency continuum\nobservations of this system to further differentiate between these two scenarios.\nNGC 625 is a remarkable system. It appears to be one of only a few dwarf galaxies\nthat have shown neutral gas blowout from the active star formation regions. It is the only\ndwarf galaxy known to show the kinematic signature of blowout, but not to show a large\nevacuated region near the active star formation region (although such a hole(s) may have\ngone undetected in the present experiment, at our resolution). Given the detection of diffuse\nsoft x-ray gas above the plane of this system (Bomans & Grant 1998), it appears that\nthe extended massive star formation event in NGC 625 (Cannon et al. 2003) has achieved a\nsimilar integrated effect. This has important implications for the evolution of dwarf galaxies.\nGiven the correct conditions, they are able to sustain extended star formation events, which\nwill have dramatic effects on the ISM and surrounding IGM.\nThe authors appreciate the insightful comments of an anonymous referee that helped\nto improve this manuscript.
