With respect to the\nnucleon mass the present results are between the two approximations developed by Ji. We also developed\nthree approximations for the separation of the pion mass, which is also compared with Ji results. With the\nhelp of the quark condensate relation obtained by Nassif and Silva in 2006, we were able to separate the\nquark energy into its kinetic and potential parts.\n\n1 \u2013 INTRODUCTION\nIn a letter dealing with the mass structure of nucleon, Ji [1] states that an insight on\nthis subject can be achieved by using QCD with help of the deep-inelastic momentum\nsum rule and the trace anomaly.\nAs was pointed out by Ji [2] for any physical system, a good knowledge about its\nmass structure is helpful in understanding the underlying dynamics of it. Through a\nstudy of the energy-momentum tensor of QCD, Ji [1,2] was able to make the separation\nof the hadron masses into contributions from quark kinetic and potential energies, the\ngluon energy, the current quark masses, and the trace anomaly. Also according to Ji [2],\nthe part of the trace anomaly is a direct consequence of the scale symmetry breaking,\nand is analogous to the vacuum pressure empirically introduced in the MIT bag model\n[3,4]. In order to evaluate the separation of the masses terms, Ji [2] makes use of two\nmatrix elements: the momentum fraction of the hadron carried by quarks in the finite\nmomentum frame and the quarks scalar charges.\nIn the present work we intend to pursue further on this subject, namely to estimate the\nmass separation in hadrons, through alternative paths to those followed by Ji [1,2]. A\nway of doing is by making the direct evaluations of the contributions, for instance by\nestimating the strong couplings of the nucleon and the pion, just at their respective rest\nmasses. Besides this, by assuming reasonable ratios between the color-electric and\ncolor-magnetic field intensities, it is possible to make direct evaluations of the gluon\nenergy and of the trace anomaly contributions to the hadron masses.\nAs an phenomenology oriented author, we skip the detailed calculations worked out\nby Ji [1,2] which shows that the energy-momentum tensor of QCD can be decomposed\nbetween traceless and trace parts. According to Ji [1,2] the traceless part of it can be\nseparated into contributions of the quark and gluon parts. On the other hand, the trace\npart of the energy-momentum tensor of QCD is decomposed into the quark mass and\nthe trace anomaly terms. We refer to the Physical Review Letters [1] and Physical\nReview D [2] papers by Xiangdong Ji, for detailed analysis of these separations.\n\n2 \u2013 SOME PRELIMINAIRES\nAccording to Xiangdong Ji [1], the QCD Hamiltonian reflecting the mass separation of\nthe hadrons can be written as\n1\n\n\fHQCD = Hq + Hm + Hg + Ha ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nHq = \u222b d3x \u03a8+(-iD.\u03b1)\u03a8,\n\n(2)\n\nHm = \u222b d3x \u03a8+ m \u03a8,\n\n(3)\n\nHg = \u222b d3x 1\u20442(E2 + B2),\n\n(4)\n\nHa = \u222b d3x [9\u03b1s \u2044 (16\u03c0)] (E2 - B2).\n\n(5)\n\nHere Hq [eq. (2)] stands for the quark and the anti-quark kinetic and potential energies\n(quark energy for short) and contributes with 3(a \u2013 b) \u2044 4 fraction of the hadron mass M.\nHm [eq.(3)] is the hadron mass term and contributes with b fraction of the mass. Hg\n[eq.(4)] is the gluon energy and contributes with 3(1-a) \u2044 4 fraction of the hadron mass.\nFinally, Ha [eq.(5)] is the trace anomaly term and contributes with (1-b) \u2044 4 fraction of\nthe hadron mass.\nAs was pointed out by Ji [1, 2], in the chiral limit, the gluon energy of the trace\nanomaly (equal to M \u2044 4) corresponds exactly to the vacuum energy in the MIT bag\nmodel [3,4]. Therefore the chiral limit is equivalent to take b = 0 and a = .5 in the\nprevious representations of the fractions of the hadron mass. X Ji [1,2] evaluated the\ncolor-electric and color-magnetic fields contributions for the gluon energy and found\nthat the magnetic-field energy is negative. It seems that this negative energy could be\nattributed to the gluon color paramagnetism.\n3 \u2013 THE MASS STRUCTURE OF THE NUCLEON\nInspired in X Ji [1,2] work, taking into account the negative contribution of the colormagnetic field to the gluon energy, and starting from the chiral limit we write\nMg \u2044 Ma = {1\u20442(E2 \u2013 [B2]) V} \u2044 {[9\u03b1s \u2044 (16\u03c0)] (E2 + [B2]) V} = 3 \u2044 2.\n\n(6)\n\nIn eq.(6), E2 stands for the averaged color-electric field and V is the volume of the\nnucleon. We also took the ratio between the gluon energy and the trace anomaly energy\nas 3 \u2044 2, by considering the chiral limit. Besides this we used the algebraic trick\n[B2] = - B2.\n\n(7)\n\nThe algebraic trick used in (7) is a way of dealing with the negative color-magnetic field\ncontribution for the gluon energy.\nIn order to proceed further we are going to determine the strong coupling strength \u03b1s\nat the energy scale of the nucleon. Let us take the color-charge of the nucleon\nhomogeneously distributed over a spherical shell of radius r plus a surface tension term\n\u03c3, in an analogous way to that considered in the Dirac's extensible model of the electron\n[5, 6], leading to the potential\nPDirac = \u03b1s\u0127c \u2044 (2r) + 4\u03c0r2\u03c3.\n\n(8)\n\n2\n\n\fThe radius of equilibrium of this spherical shell is given by\nRs = (3\u03b1s \u0127) \u2044 (4Mc).\n\n(9)\n\nNaturally, due to the Gauss' law, the color-electric field is null inside the shell and finite\noutside it. This behavior of the color-electric fields mimics a step-like function behavior\nof the running coupling constant, namely\n\u03b1s(r \u2265 Rs) = finite,\n\nand \u03b1s(r \u2264 Rs) = 0.\n\n(10)\n\nThe null intensity of the color-electric field inside the shell resembles the asymptotic\nfreedom behavior of the running coupling constant (Please see reference [7]). Now we\nare led to think this spherical shell of radius Rs with the consequent discontinuity it\nimposes on the color-electric field, behaving as an event horizon surface. In this way it\nis possible to attribute to it a kind of Hawking radiation. In the present deduction we\nfollow the steps undergone in reference [8], dealing with the physics of the black hole\nradiation.\nLet us consider at the surface of the spherical shell (resembling a surface horizon of a\nblack hole), a circle of radius Rs (eq.(9)). A fluctuating color-electric field that can\nradiate will be taken as a transverse field of intensity Et, and we suppose it has equal\nprobability to assume positive or negative values. A color test charge es coupled to this\nfield and the integration of this force over a small interval of the circle's arc \u2206S will\ngive on average null contribution for the energy, due to the fluctuating character of this\nfield. Thus we need to take into account the second moment of this \"elastic\" energy and\nwe write\nU = [es Et(\u2206S \u2044 2\u03c0)] 2 \u2044 (2Mc2)\n\n(11)\n\nIn (11), we have \"normalized\" U dividing the numerator by 2Mc2, by taking into\naccount the possibility of producing a particles pair from the vacuum. The field Et is\nassumed to be responsible by the nucleon excitation. We want to compare this field with\nthe radial color-electric field Er, which maintains the test charge tied to the spherical\nshell. We also rescaled \u2206S, dividing it by 2\u03c0 (eq.(11)). In this way we assure that a light\nfront will take the same time of travel to go from the center of symmetry of the shell to\nits surface, as to cover its rescaled perimeter. We can also write\nU = 1\u20442 k(\u2206S)2,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere\nk = (es Et)2 \u2044 [(2\u03c0)2Mc2],\n\n(13)\n\nis the spring constant of a harmonic oscillator. The angular frequency of this oscillator\nis\n\u03c9 = (k \u2044 M)1 \u2044 2 = (es Et) \u2044 (2\u03c0Mc).\n\n(14)\n\nSolving (14) for Et we get\n\n3\n\n\fEt = (2\u03c0\u03c9Mc) \u2044 es .\n\n(15)\n\nOn the other hand, the radial field at the spherical surface is given by\nEr|r=Rs = (1\u2044 4\u03c0\u03b5o) es \u2044 Rs2 = (1\u2044 4\u03c0\u03b5o) es M2c2 \u2044 [(9\u2044 16)\u03b1s2\u01272].\n\n(16)\n\nIn (16) we wrote the strong (or color) charge es in terms of an equivalent electric charge.\nWe assume that at the surface of the spherical shell, considered as a surface horizon, the\nvacuum fluctuations are so great that the strength of the radiative field equals to that of\nthe radial binding field. So, by imposing the equality between Et and Er fields (eqs.(15)\nand (16)), we get\n\u0127\u03c9 = (8Mc2) \u2044 (9\u03c0 \u03b1s ).\n\n(17)\n\nes2 \u2044 (4\u03c0\u03b5o) = \u03b1s \u0127c.\n\n(18)\n\nTo obtain (17) we also used that\n\nAlternatively, the use of the Bohr-Sommerfeld method of quantization on treating the\nradial excitations of the nucleon, led to the separation in its energy levels, namely the\nseparation between the ground state and the centroid of the excited states [9, 10].\nThe obtained result [9] was\n\u2206U = (2Mc2) \u2044 \u03c0.\n\n(19)\n\nBy imposing the equality between \u0127\u03c9 (eq. (17)) and \u2206U, we finally obtain\n\u03b1s = 4 \u2044 9.\n\n(20)\n\nThis is the value we have estimated for the strong coupling at the energy scale of the\nnucleon.\nInserting the value of \u03b1s given by (20) into (6) and solving for the ratio [B2] \u2044 E2, in the\nchiral limit, we get\n[B2] \u2044 E2 = (4\u03c0 \u2013 3) \u2044 (4\u03c0 \u2013 3) = .614 \u2248 6 \u2044 10.\n\n(21)\n\nWe must to stress that (21) stands for the ratio between the averaged magnitudes of the\nmagnetic-color and electric-color fields.\nPursuing further within the chiral limit we can write\n(1\u2044 2)(E2 \u2013 [B2])V = (3 \u2044 8)M,\n\n(22)\n\nand by using (21) we obtain\n<P| E2 |P> = E2 V = 1826 MeV,\n\n(23)\n\n<P| B2 |P> = B2 V = - 1121 MeV.\n\n(24)\n\nand\n\n4\n\n\fThe above results must be compared with those evaluated by X Ji [1, 2] which got 1700\nMeV and \u2013 1050 MeV for the color-electric and color-magnetic fields respective\ncontributions to the gluon energy part of the nucleon mass.\nNext we intend to improve the previous calculations of the mass structure of the\nnucleon, starting from relation (21) and going beyond the chiral limit.\n\n4 \u2013 THE MASS STRUCTURE OF THE NUCLEON BEYOND THE CHIRAL LIMIT\nTaking into account eq.(21), we can write\n\u222b d3x 1\u20442(E2 + B2) \u2248 (1\u2044 2)(.4){ E2 (r,t)}|space-time averageV.\n\n(25)\n\nThe next step it is to evaluate the averages in the color-electric field. To accomplish\nthis, let us make the following reasoning. A known feature of the strong force behavior\nis that it has a short-range order character, represented by the color fields being confined\nin the region inside the nucleon volume, as in the MIT bag model [3,4] case. A possible\nmimic to represent this behavior is to take the strong charge of the nucleon\nhomogeneously distributed over a spherical volume of radius R, and with an effective\nstrong coupling given by \u03b1eff. Besides this we need a spherical shell with an equal\namount of \"anti-strong charge\" also of radius R, so that Gauss' law implies in the exact\ncancellation of the effective color-electric field in the region r > R. A straightforward\ncalculation of the energy stored in this sphere yields\nUstatic = (1 \u2044 10) (\u03b1eff \u0127c) \u2044 R.\n\n(26)\n\nTurning to the evaluation of the averages of the electric-color field we have\n{ E2 (r,t)}|space-time = { E2 (r)}|space <cos2\u03c9t>|time = (1\u2044 2) { E2 (r)}|space.\n\n(27)\n\nIn eq.(27), we have written the time dependence of the electric-color field in terms of\none mode of oscillation, namely cos2\u03c9t, leading to a 1\u2044 2 factor as a consequence of the\ntime-averaging. For the space dependence we can write\n{ E2 (r,t)}|space-av = E02(1\u2044 R3)\u222boR r2 dr = E02 \u2044 3.\n\n(28)\n\nIn eq.(28), we took into account the behavior of a static electric field of a homogeneous\nsphere of charge. Thus using equations (28), ( 27) and (25), we get\nMg = (1\u2044 3)(.1 E02V ) = (1\u2044 3) M,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere we have identified ( E02V ) \u2044 10, with the nucleon mass M, after looking at (26).\nBeyond the chiral approximation (BCA), the trace anomaly contribution for the nucleon\nmass reads\nMa = \u222b d3x [9\u03b1s \u2044 (16\u03c0)] (E2 + [B2]) = 4(1.6) \u2044 (16\u03c0) { E2 (r,t)}|space-time V.\n\n(30)\n\nWorking in an analogous way we have done before we obtain\n\n5\n\n\fMa = (2 \u2044 3\u03c0)(.1 E02V ) = (2 \u2044 3\u03c0) M.\n\n(31)\n\nWe observe that for sake of simplicity, we took the ratio between the absolute values\ncontributions of the electric and magnetic color fields as exactly equal to 6 \u2044 10. Now by\nusing X Ji [1,2] notation, we can write\nMa = (1-b) M \u2044 4 = (2 \u2044 3\u03c0) M,\n\n(32)\n\nMm = bM = [(3\u03c0 \u2013 8) \u2044 (3\u03c0)]M.\n\n(33)\n\nMg = 3(1-a)M \u2044 4 = M \u2044 3,\n\n(34)\n\nwhich gives\n\nWe also have\n\nleading to\na=5\u20449\n\nand\n\nb = (3\u03c0 \u2013 8) \u2044 (3\u03c0) \u2248 .151 .\n\n(35)\n\nThen the quark kinetic plus potential energy is given by\nMq = 3(a - b)M \u2044 4 = [(6 \u2013 \u03c0) \u2044 (3\u03c0)]M.\n\n(36)\n\nWe present in table 1, the separation of the nucleon mass into different contributions\nevaluated in the BCA.

May be they\nindirectly reflect the finiteness of the strange quark mass.\nBy considering the gluon energy we can write\n1\u20442(.4){E2}|space-time av.V = M \u2044 3,\n\n(37)\n\nwhere we have taking into account (29) and that [B2] = .6 E2 . Therefore we get\n\n6\n\n\f<P| E2 |P>|BCA = {E2 }|space-time av. V = (5 \u2044 3) M = 1565 MeV,\n\n(38)\n\n<P| B2 |P>|BCA = {B2}|space-time av. V = - M = - 939 MeV.\n\n(39)\n\nand\n\nBCA stands for Beyond Chiral Approximation.\nTaking the sum of the color-electric and the color-magnetic contributions to the\nenergy we obtain\n<P| E2 |P>|BCA + <P| B2 |P>|BCA = (2 \u2044 3) M = \u0127\u03c9HOA.\n\n(40)\n\nIn (40), \u03c9HOA stands for the frequency of the harmonic oscillator approximation,\nsometimes used to describe the nucleon mass [10].\n\n5 \u2013 THE MASS STRUCTURE OF THE PION\nIn order to evaluate the contributions to the mass of the pion, let us start from the MIT\nbag model [3,4,9]. It is possible to think about a characteristic sound velocity vs, related\nto a massive particle of color-charge es. We write\n(41)\nvs = (Pvac \u2044 \u03c1)1\u2044 2 = (1\u20442) c,\nwhere Pvac and \u03c1 are the hadron pressure and the averaged density of hadron matter.\nOn the other hand let us consider the Lorentz color-force acting on this particle. We\nhave\ndp \u2044 dt = es E + (es \u2044c) vs x B,\n\n(42)\n\nwhere p is the momentum of the dressed quark or dressed gluon. In a representation\nwhere color-electric and color-magnetic fields have the same dimensionality, the energy\nassociated to electric part is proportional to es2 and to the magnetic one is proportional\nto (es vs \u2044c)2. Also due to the color- paramagnetism of the vacuum the magnetic\ncontribution has a negative signal. Basing on these ideas we can write\n<B2>|time av. = - 1\u20444 <E2>|time av.\n\n(43)\n\nAs a means to deal with the separation of the pion mass it seems better to assume the\npion modeled as a flux tube, rather than it endowed with a spherical symmetry.\nTherefore we write for the gluon energy contribution to the pion mass:\nMg = 1\u20442 ( <E2>|time av. + <B2>|time av.) V = (1\u20442)(3 \u2044 4) <E2>|time av. V.\n\n(44)\n\nBut\n<E2>|time av. = E02 <cos2\u03c9t>|time av. = 1\u20442 E02,\n\n(45)\n\nMg(pion) = (3 \u2044 8) (1\u20442E02V) = (3 \u2044 8) m\u03c0.\n\n(46)\n\nyielding\n\n7\n\n\fIn (47), we have identified 1\u20442E02V with m\u03c0.\nIn the next step we will evaluate the trace anomaly contribution for the pion mass. This\nwill be done through two approximations.\nTRACE ANOMALY OF THE PION - FIRST APPROXIMATION\nTo evaluate the trace anomaly contribution to the pion mass we need to know the\nstrong coupling constant at this energy scale. One way to do this is by observing a plot\nof the Cornell Potential, where we verify that there is a very good agreement among the\nvarious numerical fittings used to represent it (please see A. V. Nesterenko paper [11].\nWe also observe that the zero of these fittings to the Cornell Potential (CP) occurs at\napproximately .5 fm. Meanwhile the \"Maximum Floatability Hypothesis\" was applied\nto the CP (please see Silva [12]) and was found that the zero of it occurs at the radius R0\ngiven by\nR0 = [(4 \u2044 3)\u03b1s\u0127] \u2044 (mqc),\n\n(47)\n\nwhere mq is the quark constituent mass, taken as one third of the nucleon mass. By\ntaking R0 = .5 fm, and solving (47) for \u03b1s we find that\n\u03b1s (pion) = .591.\n\n(48)\n\nThe energy contribution of the trace anomaly for the pion mass can therefore be\nevaluated in this first approximation. We have\nMa = [(9 \u03b1s) \u2044 (16\u03c0)](<P|E2 \u2013 B2|P>) = [(9 \u03b1s) \u2044 (16\u03c0)](< E2> - <B2>)|time av..\n\n(49)\n\nUsing (43), (45) and (48) into (49), we finally obtain\nMa (pion) \u2248 (1\u2044 7.6) m\u03c0.\n\n(50)\n\nRelation (50) implies that, in a first approximation, we have\nb \u2248 9\u2044 19,\n\n(51)\n\na = 1\u2044 2.\n\n(52)\n\nand as we get from (46)\n\nThese evaluated results are used to glimpse an anatomy of the pion mass in Table 2.\nThere we are going to compare this first approximation for the separation of the pion\nmass with the results obtained by Ji [2]. Now let us go to the second approximation.\n\nTRACE ANOMALY OF PION \u2013 SECOND APPROXIMATION\nAs was pointed out by X Ji [2], according to the Goldstone theorem, the pion is\nintrinsically different from ordinary hadrons: - it is a collective mode in QCD vacuum.\n\n8\n\n\fBased on this statement we are going to assume that the quarks kinetic plus potential\nenergy and quarks masses both contribute with zero for the pion mass. To accomplish\nthis, we will set a = b = 0 in the X Ji relations [1,2], in order to determine the strong\ncoupling at the pion mass scale, in the second approximation. We write\n1\u20442 ( <E2>|time av. + <B2>|time av.) V = (3 \u2044 4) m\u03c0,\n\n(53)\n\n[(9 \u03b1s) \u2044 (16\u03c0)](< E2> - <B2>)|time av. V = (1 \u2044 4) m\u03c0.\n\n(54)\n\nand\n\nBy using (43) in the (53) and (54) relations and solving for \u03b1s, we find\n\u03b1s(pion)|second approx. = (8\u03c0) \u2044 45 \u2248 .559.\n\n(55)\n\nNow, by using (43), (45) and (55) into (49) we obtain\nMa (pion)|second approx. = (1 \u2044 8) m\u03c0.\n\n(56)\n\nAs can be verified in Table 2, we got in this second approximation the same numbers\nfor the mass structure of pion as those obtained by X Ji [2]. Nevertheless, we can also\ndetermine separately the color-electric and the color-magnetic field contributions and\nwe get\n<P| E2 |P> = {E2 }|space-time av. V = m\u03c0,\n\n(57a)\n\n<P| B2 |P> = {B2}|space-time av. V = - (1\u20444)m\u03c0.\n\n(57b)\n\nThese estimations, the separated contributions o f color- electric and color-magnetic\nfields to the gluon energy, differs from those obtained by X Ji [2], where for simplicity,\npure non-Abelian gauge theory (without quarks) was considered.\n\nTRACE ANOMALY OF PION \u2013 THIRD APPROXIMATION\nLet us start from the Goldberger-Treiman relation [13]\ng\u03c0qq f\u03c0 = mq,\n\n(58)\n\nwhere g\u03c0qq is the pion-quark-quark coupling and f\u03c0 is the pion constant. Besides this we\ncan also write\ng\u03c0qq m\u03c0 = M \u2044 2 = (3 \u2044 2) mq.\n\n(59)\n\nIn (59) we supposed the nucleon interacting with itself through a mix of quarks and the\npion. Combining (58) and (59) yields\nm\u03c0 = (3 \u2044 2) f\u03c0.\n\n(60)\n\n9\n\n\fNow let us consider the possibility that the, <B2>|time av. = - 1\u20444 <E2>|time av. relation,\nnamely eq. (43), used in the first and second approximations to evaluate the mass\nstructure of pion could be modified, perhaps even in a certain sense improved. Then we\nwrite\n< E 2 > V = m\u03c0 ,\n\n(61a)\n\n(<B2> + < E2 >) V = f\u03c0 = (2 \u2044 3) m\u03c0.\n\n(61b)\n\nRelations (61) imply that\n<B2> V = - (1 \u2044 3) m\u03c0 = - (1 \u2044 3) < E2 > V.\n\n(62)\n\nUsing (62) and \u03b1s(pion) given by (55), we can evaluate again the gluon energy and\ntrace anomaly parts of the pion mass, obtaining\nMg(pion)|third app. = (1 \u2044 3) m\u03c0,\n\n(63a)\n\nMa(pion)|third app. = (2 \u2044 15) m\u03c0.\nThe third approximation leads to\n\n(63b)\n\na = 5 \u2044 9,\n\nb = 7 \u2044 15.\n\nand\n\n(64)\n\nIn table 2, the three approximations developed in this work for analyze the mass\nstructure of the pion are compared with that worked out by X Ji [2]. We notice that there\nis an agreement between the second approximation of this paper and that of X Ji work.\n\nTable 2 \u2013 Pion mass separated into different contributions.

First we write\n\n10\n\n\f\u222b d3x \u03a8+ m \u03a8 = |<\u03a8+\u03a8>| m V,\n\n(65)\n\n|<\u03a8+\u03a8>| = (\u03c0 M3) \u2044 128,\n\n(66)\n\nwhere\n\nIs the absolute value of the quark condensate as obtained in reference [7]. WE put by\nthe hand the bare mass sum contribution to the nucleon\nM \u2248 20 MeV \u2248 M \u2044 47,\n\n(67)\n\nand the nucleons volume V equal to\nV = (4 \u2044 3) \u03c0 R3 = (4 \u2044 3) \u03c0 (4 \u2044 M)3.\n\n(68)\n\nIn (68) we took the nucleon radius equal to 4 \u2044 M, as estimated by X Ji [14].\nInserting these data on the quark mass contribution to the nucleon, we get\nMq = (2\u03c02) M \u2044 141,\n\n(69)\n\nb = (2\u03c02) \u2044 141 \u2248 .140.\n\n(70)\n\nyielding\n\n7 \u2013 BREAKING OF THE QUARK ENERGY: KINETIC PLUS POTENTIAL\nIn this section we will show that it is possible to evaluate separately the quark kinetic\nand potential energies contributions for the nucleon mass. Starting from the relation\nHq = \u222b d3x \u03a8+(-iD.\u03b1)\u03a8,\n\n(71)\n\nand by considering\nD\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc + i g A\u03bc,\n\n(72)\n\nwe can write\nHq = \u222b d3x \u03a8+(- i \u2202 \u2044 \u2202r - gA)\u03a8,\n\n(73)\n\nwhere some simplification was made taking into account that a kind of averaging will\nbe done at the end of the calculations. Besides this we make the approximation\n\u03a8 = \u03a80 e i r \u2044 R .\n\n(74)\n\nTherefore we have for the quark kinetic energy part of the nucleon mass the relations\n<K> = \u222b d3x \u03a8+(1 \u2044 R)\u03a8 = | <\u03a8+\u03a8> | (1 \u2044 R) V = (\u03c02 \u2044 6) M.\n\n(75)\n\n11\n\n\fIn the above development, we have considered the relation for the quark condensate as\ngiven in [7] and the volume V of a sphere with the nucleon's radius, R = 4 \u2044 M [3].\nTHE POTENTIAL ENERGY\nWithin the Harmonic Oscillator Approximation (HOA), we can suppose that the\nabsolute value of the potential energy is responsible by half of the quark \"interaction\nmass\". Hence we write (\u0127 = c= 1)\nmint|HOA = - (2\u03b1s) \u2044 R.\n\n(76)\n\nBeyond the HOA, we can write\nmint|BHOA = - (2f\u03b1s) \u2044 R,\n\n(77)\n\nwhere f is a number to be determined. In the pion case, by considering the second\napproximation, we can take into account the bare contributions to the kinetic and\npotential energies, namely\n1 \u2044 R[1 - 2f\u03b1s(pion)] = 0.\n\n(78)\n\nBut in the second approximation \u03b1s(pion) = (8\u03c0 \u204445), which implies\n2f = 45 \u2044 (8\u03c0).\n\n(79)\n\nOn the other hand, in the nucleon case, we have\n- g A = mint|BHOA = - [2f\u03b1s(nucleon)] \u2044 R.\n\n(80)\n\nBy using \u03b1s(nucleon) = 4 \u2044 9 and 2f = 45 \u2044 (8\u03c0), we obtain\n- g A = mint|BHOA = - (1 \u2044 R) 15 \u2044 (6\u03c0).\n\n(81)\n\nTherefore the quark potential energy contribution to the nucleon mass is\n<Pot> = -g A | <\u03a8+\u03a8> | V = - [(15\u03c0) \u2044 36] M.\n\n(82)\n\nWe may test this result by putting\nMq = <K> + <Pot> = [(\u03c02 \u2044 6) - (15\u03c0) \u2044 36] M = (3 \u2044 4)(a \u2013 b) M.\n\n(83)\n\nThus by taking a = 5 \u2044 9, we obtain\nb = (5 + 5\u03c0 - 2 \u03c02) \u2044 9 \u2248 .11.\n\n(84)\n\n8 - THE BARE MASS OF THE QUARKS IN THE NUCLEON\n\n12\n\n\fIt is possible to use the value of b estimated in (84) in order to evaluate the bare mass\nof the quarks in the nucleon. Starting from\nHm = \u222b d3x \u03a8+ m \u03a8 = b M,\n\n(85)\n\nm = M \u2044 \u03b3,\n\n(86)\n\nand taking\n\nand b given by (84), we obtain\n\u03b3 = 6\u03c02 \u2044 (5 + 5\u03c0 - 2 \u03c02) \u2248 61.\n\n(87)\n\nThe above result leads to\nm = M \u2044 \u03b3 \u2248 15.4 MeV.\n\n(88)\n\nThe result (88) for the bare mass of quarks in the nucleon must be compared with the\nvalue of 20 MeV considered before, which was inserted in the Hm by the hand.\n\n9 \u2013 RADIUS OF THE PION FROM THE QUARK MASS\nA way to evaluate the pion radius could be through these steps. First we write the\nrelation for the quark mass contribution to the pion mas\nMm(pion) = \u222b d3x \u03a8+ m \u03a8 = m <\u03a8+ \u03a8> V\u03c0.\n\n(89)\n\nNow we use the harmonic oscillator approximation to represent he pion mass\nm\u03c0 = (3 \u2044 2) f\u03c0 = (3 \u2044 2) \u03c9HOA,\n\n(90)\n\nwhere we have identified f\u03c0 with the frequency of the harmonic oscillator. To pursue\nfurther we consider the Gell-Mann, Oakes, Renner relation [15]\nf\u03c02 m\u03c02 = m | <\u03a8+\u03a8> |.\n\n(91)\n\nR \u03c0 = \u03b4 \u2044 m \u03c0.\n\n(92)\n\nWe also write\n\nand\nMm(pion) = b m\u03c0 = (1 \u2044 2) m\u03c0.\n\n(93)\n\nWorking with the above relations we find that\n\u03b4 = 3 \u2044 (32\u03c0)1\u2044 3 \u2248 3 \u2044 4.65.\n\n(94)\n\n13\n\n\fFinally we obtain for the pion radius\nR\u03c0 = \u03b4 \u2044 m\u03c0 \u2248 .91 fm.\n\n(95)\n\n10- ANALOGY WITH THE CRYSTAL GROWING\n\nConsider the following relation\nHm(pion) = \u222b d3x \u03a8+ m \u03a8 = m|<\u03a8+ \u03a8>| V\u03c0.\n\n(96)\n\nIt is tempting to make an analogy between the above relation and the growing of a\ncrystal from a water solution of its salt. If we consider that we have the bare mass, a\nsum of a two-flavor quark-antiquark pair, approximately equal to m\u03c0 \u2044 14 or 10 MeV, we\nobtain as an output the mass contribution of the quarks to the pion equal to m\u03c0 \u2044 2 or 70\nMeV.\nIn the process of crystal growing, starting from a saturated water solution of the salt, a\nsmall seed is merged into the solution and slowly the crystal proceeds to grow by\nadding mass of the solution to the seed.\nWe may think that the vacuum from the quantum chromodynamics, represented by\nthe quark condensate, works in a similar way to the water solution of the salt, and\ndresses the bare mass of the pion, multiplying its value by a factor of seven. This\nanalogy can also be applied to the nucleon case.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] X. Ji, Phys. Rev. Lett.74, 1071 (1995).\n[2] X. Ji. Phys. Rev. D 52, 271 (1995). Please see also references therein.\n[3] A.
