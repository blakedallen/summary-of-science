A solution published in [13]\nuses contributions of many mathematicians including W. Haken, F. Waldhausen,\nW. Jaco, P. Shalen, K. Johannson, G. Hemion, W. Thurston, and S. Matveev. The\npreviously announced solution by G. Hemion was shown to be incomplete by S. Matveev.\nIt is not difficult to construct an algorithm that enumerates all diagrams of links,\nwhich, in conjunction with the previously mentioned algorithm, gives the possibility of generating a list of diagrams in which each isotopy class of links is presented\nexactly once and, for any other diagram, to locate the corresponding isotopy class\nin the list.\nThe algorithm for recognizing links mentioned above is extremely complex and\ngives only a theoretical solution of the problem. It actually deals with threemanifolds which are link complements provided with a meridian-longitude pair in\neach connected component of the boundary. Up to now, this algorithm cannot be\nused in practice because of the huge number of operations needed for its implementation, even for links with a small number of crossings.\nAt the same time, a theoretical solution of the problem will be given, if, for\nsome computable function f (n) (say, exp(exp(exp(n!)))), one shows that any two\ndiagrams of the same link type that have 6 n crossings can be obtained from each\nother by 6 f (n) Reidemeister moves. However, an explicit formula for such a\nfunction is still unknown.\nIt seems to be widely understood that the following problems, which are important ingredients of the general classification problem, are simpler from the practical\npoint of view:\n1) recognizing the trivial knot;\n2) recognizing a split link and presenting it as the distant union of two non-empty\nlinks;\n3) recognizing a composite non-split link and presenting it as the connected sum\nof two non-trivial links.\nWe shall call the aggregate of these three problem the decomposition problem, since\na solution of all three allows one to express any given link in terms of prime nonsplit links and the unknot by using the connected sum and distant union operations.\nSuch a decomposition is known to be essentially unique, but to solve the general\nclassification problem, one must also construct an algorithm for comparing isotopy\nclasses of two prime non-split links that are presented by their diagrams.\n\n2\n\n\fThe decomposition problem was solved by W. Haken [10] and H. Schubert [18]\nby using Haken's method of normal surfaces, which plays a very important r\u00f4le in\nmodern three-dimensional topology. (In particular, normal surfaces are used in the\nalgorithm for recognizing Haken manifolds mentioned above and in the Rubinstein\u2013\nThompson algorithm for recognizing the three-sphere).\nFinding normal surfaces seems to be an exponentially hard problem. At least,\nthe known realizations are that hard, both theoretically and in practice. So, any\nalgorithm that uses Haken's technique has almost no chance to be implementable\nin a reasonable time.\nIn recent years, a few attempts have been made to find an algorithm for recognizing the trivial knot by using some monotonic simplification. By the latter we\nmean the following. One chooses a way of presenting knots by diagrams of certain\ntype and introduces the notion of complexity c(D) of a diagram. For the chosen\ntype of presentation, one also fixes a set of elementary moves that do not alter the\ntopological type of a knot. Then, for a given diagram D of a knot, one searches for\na sequence of diagrams\nD0 = D, D1 , D2 , . . .\n(1)\nsuch that, for each i, the diagram Di+1 is obtained from Di by an elementary move\nand we have c(Di+1 ) 6 c(Di ) (or c(Di+1 ) < c(Di ), in which case we shall speak of\na strictly monotonic simplification). If there exists an algorithm that, for any D,\nproduces such a sequence D0 = D, D1 , . . . , DN = D \u2032 in which the last diagram D \u2032\ncannot be simplified anymore, we shall say that D is monotonically simplifiable to\nD \u2032 . Such an algorithm certainly exists if, for any n, there are only finitely many\ndiagrams D such that c(D) < n (which will be the case for arc-presentations)\nbecause, in this case, we can find all monotonic simplification sequences in finite\ntime by using an exhaustive search. If, for any diagram D of the unknot, the diagram\nD \u2032 obtained from D by a simplification algorithm is always the trivial diagram, we\nshall speak about the recognition of the unknot by monotonic simplification.\nIt is well known that, in the case of ordinary planar diagrams with Reidemeister\nmoves as elementary moves and the crossing number as the measure of complexity,\nrecognizing the unknot by monotonic simplification is not possible because there\nexist diagrams of the unknot that cannot be simplified to the trivial circle by using\nonly Reidemeister moves not increasing the crossing number.\nAccording to A. E. Hatcher's solution of the Smale conjecture [11], there is no\ntopological obstruction to the existence of a flow \u03c9 on the space of knots such that\nany unknotted curve will evolve under \u03c9 to a round circle. Such a flow may be\nthe gradient flow of some energy function, which plays the r\u00f4le of the measure of\ncomplexity. Appropriate discretization of the flow may lead to a strict monotonic\nsimplification algorithm. Some investigation of the gradient flows on the knot space\nand numerical experiments have been done in the literature (see, e.g., [16], [9], [12]).\nA monotonic simplification procedure for spines of three-manifolds has been\nworked out by S. V. Matveev in [14] for recognizing three-manifolds. It also can\nbe used for recognizing the unknot: for a given knot one first constructs a spine\nof the knot complement and then applies the simplification algorithm. Numerical\nexperiments of this kind has been made by E. Fominykh.\n\n3\n\n\fIn [8], the author introduced three-page presentations of knots. The complexity\nof a three-page knot is defined to be the number of vertices at the binding line of the\nthree-page book. A simplification procedure for three-page knots has been tested\non a series of examples.\nIn all three mentioned situations, it has not been proved that a monotonic simplification to a trivial circle is always possible for any presentation of the unknot,\nbut no counterexamples have been found either, though attempts have been made.\nThe first successful attempt to find a measure of complexity with respect to\nwhich any presentation of the unknot admits a monotonic simplification was made\nby J. Birman and W. Menasco in [4]. The authors studied presentations of a knot as\nthe closure of a braid and showed that the number of strands in a non-trivial braid\npresenting the unknot can always be reduced by certain type moves. The moves\ninclude the Markov moves that do not increase the number of strands (i.e., braid\nconjugations and \"destabilizations\", which are the Markov moves that reduce the\nnumber of strands) and so-called exchange moves, which preserve the number of\nstrands. The ideas of [4] and the known solution of the conjugacy problem for braid\ngroups were used by J. Birman and M. Hirsch in [2] to construct a new algorithm\nfor recognizing the unknot. This algorithm, however, does not have the form a\nmonotonic simplification algorithm in our sense, and it is not clear whether the\nstraightforward idea of monotonic simplification can be used here, since no algorithm\nis known to decide whether a given braid conjugacy class admits a destabilization\nafter finitely may exchanges.\nThe problem of recognizing the unknot happens to be very closely related to two\nother problems: recognizing split links and recognizing composite links. In many\ncases, one and the same technique allows to solve all three problems. The distant\nunion and connected sum operations can be defined at the level of diagrams. But\na split (or composite) link can usually be presented by a non-split (respectively,\nprime) diagrams. So, the general question is this: for a given diagram D, can one\napply finitely many elementary moves without increasing the complexity so that the\nfinal diagram is obtained by the distant union and connected sum operations from\ntrivial diagrams and diagrams of prime non-split links? J. Birman and W. Menasco\nhave shown in [3] that the answer is positive in the case of closed braids (there is a\ngap in the proof of the result on composite links, but the assertion is true).\nAt first look, arc-presentations, which we study in this paper, seem to have nothing in common with braids. However, the braid foliation technique that J. Birman\nand W. Menasco developed in a series of papers including [3] and [4] turned out\nto be very well adopted for studying arc-presentations of knots. The fact that the\nBirman\u2013Menasco foliated surface technique can be extended to arc-presentations\nwas discovered by P. Cromwell in paper [6], where he proved the additivity of the\narc index under the connected sum operation. The possibility of a monotonic simplification and other algorithmic questions are not discussed in [6], but a sequence\nof moves preserving the complexity appears in the proof. The generalized type I\nmove of [6] can be easily decomposed into elementary moves (Proposition 5 of this\npaper). In conjunction with this remark, the arguments of [6] would suffice for a\nproof of recognizibility of split links by monotonic simplification. As for recognizing\ncomposite links, there is a gap in the final part of the proof of the main result of [6],\n\n4\n\n\fwhich is covered in this paper. We also provide some technical details that are not\nmentioned in [6].\nIn addition to this, we extend the foliated surface technique to spanning discs of\narc-presentations of the unknot. Compared to the case of a splitting or factorizing\nsphere, spanning discs require delicate care of their behaviour near the boundary.\nIn the earlier version of the present manuscript, the treatment of the boundary\nwas not careful enough, and a gap occurred in the proof of the main result. The\nmistake was discovered by W. Menasco and A. Sikora who also suggested an idea\nfor filling the gap. We use their suggestion in modified form.\nThe main result of this paper is the following.\nTheorem 1. The decomposition problem of arc-presentations is solvable by monotonic simplification.\nIn order to make this claim less abstract in this superficial introduction, we\nexplain it in a very elementary language. Let us call a rectangular diagram an\nordinary planar diagram D of a link satisfying the following restrictions:\n1) D consists only of vertical and horizontal straight line segments, which we call\nedges;\n2) at each crossing of D, the vertical arc is overcrossing and the horizontal one\nundercrossing;\n3) no two edges are collinear (see Fig. 1).\n\nFigure 1: A rectangular diagram\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\nTwo such diagrams are called combinatorially equivalent if they are isotopic in the\nplane via an ambient isotopy h that has the form h(x, y) = (f (x), g(y)).\nSince the type of a crossing is determined by its position, there is no need to\nindicate in figures which arc is overcrossing and which one undercrossing.\nClearly, any planar diagram of a link is isotopic to a rectangular diagram (see\nbelow).\nThe following transforms of rectangular diagrams are elementary moves:\n\n5\n\n\fFigure 2: Cyclic permutation of vertical edges\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n0) cyclic permutation of horizontal (vertical) edges (see Fig. 2);\n1) stabilization and destabilization (Fig. 3);\n\nFigure 3: Stabilization and destabilization moves\n\u275c \u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\nstabilization\n\n\u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\ndestabilization\n\n\u275c \u275c\n\u275c\n\nstabilization\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\ndestabilization\n\n\u275c\n\nstabilization\n\n\u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\ndestabilization\n\nstabilization\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\u2190\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\ndestabilization\n\n\u275c\n\u275c \u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c \u275c\n\n2) interchanging neighbouring edges if their pairs of endpoints do not interleave\n(Fig. 4).\nFigures 2\u20134 illustrate particular cases of the moves. To obtain all the other cases,\none should apply all possible rotations by \u03c0k/2, k \u2208 Z and reflections in horizontal\nand vertical lines if necessary.\nThe complexity c(D) of a rectangular diagram D is the number of vertical edges\nin D. The only operations changing the complexity are stabilization (which increases\nit by 1) and destabilization (which is inverse to stabilization). We would like to\nstress that the number of crossings is not taken into account in the definition of\ncomplexity. The number of crossings of a rectangular diagram of complexity n is\nbounded from above by (n \u2212 1)2 /2. The simplest possible rectangular diagram, the\ntrivial diagram, is an ordinary rectangle. Its complexity is 2.\nA rectangular diagram D is a distant union of diagrams D1 , D2 if there is a\nvertical line l that does not intersect D and splits it into two non-trivial parts which\nare equivalent to D1 , D2 . We write D = D1 \u2294 D2 in this case.\n\n6\n\n\fFigure 4: Interchanging horizontal edges\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u275c\n\u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\nA rectangular diagram D is a connected sum of diagrams D1 and D2 if there\nexists a rectangular disk R with vertical and horizontal sides whose boundary \u2202R\nmeets D twice so that the rectangular diagrams D1 and D2 (in either order) are\nobtained from R \u2229 D and (R2 \\ R) \u2229 D by connecting the two points (\u2202R) \u2229 D\nby a simple path lying outside or inside R, respectively. In this case, we say that\nthe diagram D is composite and write D = D1 #D2 . In particular, a rectangular\ndiagram D is composite if there is a vertical or horizontal line intersecting D exactly\ntwice such that on both its sides there are at least four vertices of D.\nAs we shall see in 1.3, rectangular diagrams are just another way of thinking\nabout arc-presentations. Thus, the assertion of Theorem 1 is actually this. For\nany given rectangular diagram D, one can find a sequence of elementary moves\nD 7\u2192 D1 7\u2192 D2 7\u2192 . . . 7\u2192 DN , not including stabilization, such that the final\ndiagram DN is obtained by the connected sum and distant union operations from\ndiagrams of prime non-trivial non-split links and trivial diagrams.\nThe idea of specifying arc-presentations by drawing the corresponding rectangular diagrams is not new. It is already present in P. Cromwell's work [6], where\nhe calls them \"loops and lines\" diagrams and uses them to show that any link has\nan arc-presentation. A similar result is proved in the manuscript [17] for graphs\nembedded in R3 by using an appropriate generalization of the notion of rectangular\ndiagram.\n\n1\n1.1\n\nPreliminaries\nDefinition of arc-presentations\n\nWe shall regard a three-dimensional sphere S 3 as the join of two circles: S 3 = S 1 \u2217S 1 ,\nand use the coordinate system (\u03c6, \u03c4, \u03b8) on S 3 , where \u03c6 and \u03b8 are coordinates on\nthe circles, \u03c6, \u03b8 \u2208 R/(2\u03c0Z), and \u03c4 takes values in the interval [0, 1]. We have\n(\u03c6, 0, \u03b81 ) \u223c (\u03c6, 0, \u03b82 ) and (\u03c61 , 1, \u03b8) \u223c (\u03c62 , 1, \u03b8) for all \u03c6, \u03c61 , \u03c62 , \u03b8, \u03b81 , \u03b82 \u2208 S 1 . In\norder to distinguish between the circles \u03c4 = 0 and \u03c4 = 1, we shall denote them by\nS\u03c61 and S\u03b81 , respectively. The circle S\u03c61 will be called the binding circle. We shall\ndenote by Dt the open disk defined by \u03b8 = t, \u03c4 > 0. Such a disk will be called a\npage. We have \u2202Dt = S\u03c61 .\nWe shall regard \u03c6 and \u03b8 as functions on S 3 . As a rule, we use the notation s,\n\u2032\ns , s1 , s2 , . . . for points from S\u03c61 and t, t\u2032 , t1 , t2 , . . . for points from S\u03b81 .\n\n7\n\n\fLet L be a link in S 3 . By an arc presentation of L we shall mean a link L\u2032 in S 3\nisotopic to L such that the set L\u2032 \u2229 S\u03c61 , whose elements are called vertices, is finite,\nand, for any t \u2208 S 1 , the intersection of L\u2032 with any page Dt is either the empty set\nor an open arc approaching two distinct vertices.\nRemark 1. The term 'arc-presentation' was introduced by J. Birman and W. Menasco,\nthough the object itself appeared already in [5]. However, it has received almost no\nattention before P. Cromwell's paper [6].\n\n1.2\n\nDuality of arc-presentations\n\nTwo arc-presentations, say L1 and L2 , are not distinguished if they have the same\nset of vertices, and, for any t \u2208 S\u03b81 , we have either L1 \u2229 Dt = L2 \u2229 Dt = \u2205 or\nL1 \u2229 Dt and L2 \u2229 Dt are arcs with the same endpoints. Having agreed about this,\nwe may assume without loss of generality that any arc L \u2229 Dt of an arc-presentation\nL consists of two radii of the disk Dt . This means that L is a link consisting of\nsegments of the form P \u2217 Q \u2282 S\u03c61 \u2217 S\u03b81 , where P \u2208 S\u03c61 , Q \u2208 S\u03b81 . Notice that, in this\ndefinition, the r\u00f4les of the circles S\u03c61 and S\u03b81 are the same, and L can be considered as\nan arc-presentation with respect to both circles. Vertices of one of the presentations\nare the centers of arcs of the other.\nSo, there is a duality operation on the set of arc-presentations, which is defined by\nthe mapping \u03be : S 3 \u2192 S 3 written in our coordinate system as \u03be(\u03c6, \u03c4, \u03b8) = (\u03b8, 1\u2212\u03c4, \u03c6).\nThe r\u00f4les of arcs and vertices are interchanged under this duality.\nRemark 2. There is a triangulation T (L) of S 3 associated naturally with any arcpresentation L having n > 2 vertices. T (L) has n2 simplices that have the form\nI \u2032 \u2217 I \u2032\u2032 , where I \u2032 \u2282 S\u03c61 , (respectively, I \u2032\u2032 \u2282 S\u03b81 ) is an interval between neighbouring\nvertices of the arc-presentation L (respectively, \u03be(L)). In this construction, L is\na subset of the 1-skeleton of T (L) containing all the vertices. The main result\nof this paper can be proved by using normal surfaces if one chooses T (L) as the\nmain triangulation. In this case, the reasoning becomes \"self-dual\" with respect to\n\u03be. However, it seems to us that Birman\u2013Menasco's approach, which \"breaks the\nsymmetry\", is easier to use in our case.\n\n1.3\n\nArc-presentations and rectangular diagrams\n\nProposition 1. Let L be an arc-presentation of a link, D a rectangular diagram\n(see the Introduction) with vertices at all points (x, y) \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) \u00d7 [0, 2\u03c0) such that\nL \u2229 Dy is an arc one of whose endpoints is (x, 0, 0) \u2208 S\u03c61 . Then D presents the same\nlink as L does.\nThe correspondence L 7\u2192 D between arc-presentations and rectangular diagrams\nin [0, 2\u03c0) \u00d7 [0, 2\u03c0) is one-to-one.\nProof. The definition of D makes sense, since each arc has two endpoints, and two\narcs are attached to each vertex. Thus, in any vertical or horizontal straight line\nin the (x, y)-plane, we will have either none or two vertices. In the latter case, we\nconnect them by a straight line segment, obtaining the rectangular diagram D.\n\n8\n\n\fIt is easy to see that one can obtain D from L by cutting S 3 along disks D0 and\n\u03be(D0 ) and then projecting the result appropriately to the plane \u03c4 = 1/2. See more\nexplanations in [6].\nThe last assertion of the proposition is obvious.\nWe shall regard rectangular diagrams as a convenient way for depicting arcpresentations. Vertical edges of a rectangular diagram correspond to vertices, horizontal edges to arcs of an arc-presentation. We shall often draw appropriate rectangular diagrams for illustrating properties or transforms of arc-presentations.\n\n1.4\n\nArc-presentations and closed braids\n\nThere is also an easy way to convert a rectangular diagram (an arc-presentation) to\na closed braid. An arc presentation or a rectangular diagram can be endowed with\nan orientation as an ordinary link or an ordinary planar link diagram, respectively.\nFor an oriented rectangular diagram D, we shall call a horizontal edge of D negative\nif its orientation is opposite to the orientation of the x-axis.\nProposition 2. Let D be an oriented rectangular diagram in [0, 2\u03c0) \u00d7 [0, 2\u03c0). Let\nus replace each negative horizontal edge in D of the form [x1 , x2 ]\u00d7y, x1 < x2 , by the\nunion of two straight line segments ([\u2212\u03b5, x1 ] \u222a [x2 , 2\u03c0]) \u00d7 y, where \u03b5 > 0. As before,\nat each crossing, we interpret the vertical arc as overcrossing and the horizontal one\nas undercrossing. After a small deformation of the obtained picture, we can get a\nplanar diagram of a braid, say bD . Then the closure of bD is a link equivalent to\nthe one defined by D.\nAny diagram of a braid can be obtained from some rectangular diagram by the\nmethod just described.\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\nFigure 5: Converting a rectangular diagram to a braid\n\u2732\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u2192\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u2192\n\n\u275c\n\nThe idea is illustrated in Fig. 5. We skip the easy proof. See also [6].\n\n1.5\n\nElementary moves\n\nActually, elementary moves of arc-presentations have already been introduced in\nthe language of rectangular diagrams (see the Introduction). Here we describe\nthem directly.\n\n9\n\n\fThroughout this section, we assume that each arc of any arc-presentation L\nconsists of two radii of a disk Dt . Thus, we have t \u2208 S\u03b81 \u2229 L if and only if the page\nDt contains an arc of L.\nSuppose that we have a continuous family L(u) of arc presentations, i.e., such\nthat the sets L(u) \u2229 S\u03c61 and L(u) \u2229 S\u03b81 depend on u continuously. Then all the links\nL(u) are isotopic to each other via isotopies of the form (\u03c6, \u03c4, \u03b8) 7\u2192 (f (\u03c6), \u03c4, g(\u03b8)).\nLet us see what happens to the corresponding rectangular diagrams D(u) when u\nchanges. If no point in L(u)\u2229S\u03c61 and L(u)\u2229S\u03b81 passes through the origin 0 \u2208 S 1 , the\ndiagram D(u) also changes continuously, and the combinatorial type of D(u) stays\nunchanged. If one of the points in L(u)\u2229 S\u03c61 (respectively, L(u)\u2229 S\u03b81 ) passes through\nthe origin, the corresponding rectangular diagram is changed by a cyclic permutation of vertical (respectively, horizontal) edges. Two arc-presentations that can be\nincluded into such a continuous family are said to be combinatorially equivalent.\nThe following assertion, although quite obvious, is very important from the\nalgorithmic point of view.\nProposition 3. For any n, there are only finitely many classes of combinatorially\nequivalent arc-presentations of complexity n.\nRemark 3. One can show that the number N (n) of pairwise distinct classes of combinatorially equivalent arc-presentations of complexity n satisfies the inequalities\n((n \u2212 1)!)2 /(2n) < N (n) 6 ((n \u2212 1)!)2 .\nFor three distinct points x1 , x2 , x3 of S 1 , we shall write x2 \u2208 (x1 , x3 ) if, when going in the positive direction of S 1 we meet the points xi in this order: . . . , x1 , x2 , x3 , x1 ,\nx2 , . . .. We shall write x2 \u2208 [x1 , x3 ] if we have either x2 \u2208 (x1 , x3 ) or x2 \u2208 {x1 , x3 }.\nBy \u03b3t,s,s\u2032 we shall denote an arc in Dt such that \u2202\u03b3t,s,s\u2032 = {s, s\u2032 } \u2282 S\u03c61 . When using\nthis notation, we shall not distinguish between two arcs lying in the same page and\nhaving the same endpoints. Thus, we write \u03b3t,s,s\u2032 \u2282 L whenever we want to say\nthat L \u2229 Dt contains an arc with endpoints s, s\u2032 .\nLet \u03b1 = \u03b3t,s1 ,s2 be an arc of an arc-presentation L. For sufficiently small \u03b5 > 0,\nthere is no arc of L in Dt\u2032 if t\u2032 \u2208 (t\u2212\u03b5, t+\u03b5), except for \u03b1, and there is no vertex of L\nin (s1 \u2212 \u03b5, s1 + \u03b5) \u2282 S\u03c61 , except for s1 . Replacing the arc \u03b1 by the arcs \u03b3t,s1 +\u03b51 ,s2 and\n\u03b3t+\u03b52 ,s1 ,s1 +\u03b51 , where \u03b51,2 \u2208 {\u03b5, \u2212\u03b5}, will be called a stabilization move. The inverse\noperation will be called a destabilization move. In the language of rectangular\ndiagrams, these operations coincide with stabilization and destabilization moves of\nrectangular diagrams, respectively, provided that we have 0 \u2208\n/ (s1 \u2212 \u03b5, s1 + \u03b5) and\n0\u2208\n/ (t \u2212 \u03b5, t + \u03b5), which can always be achieved by a small perturbation of L and\ntaking \u03b5 sufficiently small.\nNotice that the (de)stabilization move is self-dual with respect to \u03be.\nLet \u03b11 , \u03b12 be two arcs of an arc-presentation L, \u03b1i \u2282 Dti , and there is no arc of\nL in \u222at\u2208(t1 ,t2 ) Dt or in \u222at\u2208(t2 ,t1 ) Dt . In this case, we shall say that the arcs \u03b11 and \u03b12\nare neighbouring.\nLet \u03b11 and \u03b12 be neighbouring arcs, s1 , s2 \u2208 S\u03c61 the endpoints of \u03b11 , and s3 , s4 be\nthe endpoints of \u03b12 , \u2202\u03b11 , \u2229\u2202\u03b12 = \u2205. We say that the arcs \u03b11 , \u03b12 are non-interleaved\nif we have either s1 , s2 \u2208 (s3 , s4 ) or s1 , s2 \u2208 (s4 , s3 ). Otherwise, they are said to be\ninterleaved. In other words, arcs are interleaved if the corresponding chords of S 1\nintersect each other (see Fig. 6).\n\n10\n\n\fFigure 6: Interleaved and non-interleaved arcs\nr\n\u272c\u2729\n\ns3\n\ns1 r\n\nr s2\n\nr\n\u272b\u272a\n\ns4\n\nr\n\u272c\u2729\n\ns2\n\ns1 r\n\nr s3\n\nr\n\u272b\u272a\n\ns4\n\ninterleaved arcs non-interleaved arcs\n\nIf \u03b11 \u2282 Dt1 , \u03b12 \u2282 Dt2 are non-interleaved neighbouring arcs, we define an arc\nexchange move on L as replacing \u03b11 , \u03b12 by arcs \u03b1\u20321 \u2208 Dt2 , \u03b1\u20322 \u2208 Dt1 such that\n\u2202\u03b1\u2032i = \u2202\u03b1i . This operation corresponds to interchanging horizontal edges of a\nrectangular diagram, probably combined with a cyclic permutation of horizontal\nedges.\nWe define a vertex exchange move to be the operation dual via \u03be to an arc\nexchange move. It corresponds to interchanging vertical edges of a rectangular\ndiagram, probably combined with a cyclic permutation of vertical edges. We shall\nuse the term 'exchange move' for both operations, an arc exchange move and a\nvertex exchange move.\nIn the sequel, stabilization, destabilization, and exchange moves will be referred\nto as elementary moves. When appropriate, we shall not distinguish between combinatorially equivalent arc-presentations and think about elementary operations as\nbeing performed on the corresponding combinatorial classes.\nProposition 4. Any link in S 3 has an arc-presentation.\nTwo arc-presentations L1 , L2 of the same link can be obtained from each other\nby finitely many elementary moves.\nProof. We provide here only a sketch, the details are very elementary and standard.\n(In [6], one can find a proof that uses Markov's theorem. The latter seems to us to\nbe much less elementary than the assertion to be proved. We would prefer to use\nReidemeister's theorem.)\nAs we have already mentioned, any planar diagram of a link is isotopic to a\nrectangular diagram. Indeed, for a given planar diagram, one can first deform\nit near crossings so that overcrossing arcs become vertical and undercrossing arcs\nhorizontal. Then one can approximate the rest of the diagram by a step-line consisting of vertical and horizontal straight line segments. In the generic case, there\nwill be no collinear segments. In order to deform such a diagram into an isotopic one, we might need to add more edges or contract some, which is achieved\nby (de)stabilization moves, and pass through codimension one degenerations, when\ntwo non-overlapping edges become collinear. The latter is achieved by exchange\nmoves.\nIn order to prove the second assertion, one shows first that rotating a crossing\nby \u03c0 as shown in Fig. 7 can be performed by applying finitely many elementary\n\n11\n\n\fFigure 7: Rotating a crossing\n\n\u2194\n\nmoves. Then one do the same with Reidemeister moves, assuming that the involved\ncrossings are already positioned as one wishes (see Fig. 8).\n\nFigure 8: A realization of the Reidemeister moves\n\n\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\nRemark 4. In [6], the set of allowed (de)stabilization-type moves in the formulations\nof an analogue of Proposition 4 is larger. We shall now see that those, more general,\nmoves can be expressed in terms of our elementary moves.\n\n1.6\n\nGeneralized moves\n\nLet \u03b1 \u2208 Dt be an arc of an arc-presentation L and s \u2208 S\u03c61 be a point distinct\nfrom vertices of L. Let s1 , s2 \u2208 S\u03c61 be the endpoints of \u03b1. Replacing \u03b1 by the arcs\n\u03b3t,s1 ,s and \u03b3t+\u03b5,s,s2 , where \u03b5 > 0 is sufficiently small, will be called a generalized\nstabilization move. (In [6], it is called a type IV move. The dual operation, which\nwe shall not need, is called a type III move in [6].) The operation inverse to a\ngeneralized stabilization move is called a generalized destabilization move.\nLet L be an arc-presentation, s1 , s2 , s3 three points of S\u03c61 distinct from vertices\nof L such that s2 \u2208 (s1 , s3 ). Suppose that for some t1 , t2 \u2208 S\u03b81 , the link L does not\nintersect any of the arcs \u03b3t,s1 ,s2 if t \u2208 [t1 , t2 ] and \u03b3t,s2 ,s3 if t \u2208 [t2 , t1 ]. In this case,\nwe shall call the operation consisting in interchanging the intervals (s1 , s2 ) (s2 , s3 ) a\ngeneralized (vertex ) exchange move. This operation can be described more formally\nas follows. Define a function f : S\u03c61 \u2192 S\u03c61 by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 s + s3 \u2212 s2 if s \u2208 (s1 , s2 ),\ns 7\u2192\ns + s1 \u2212 s2 if s \u2208 (s2 , s3 ),\n\uf8f3\ns\notherwise.\n\n12\n\n\fThen the generalized exchange move just defined consists in replacing each arc of the\nform \u03b3t,s,s\u2032 by the arc \u03b3t,f (s),f (s\u2032 ) . (In [6], this operation is called generalized type I\nmove.) The dual operation, generalized arc exchange move, will not be needed here.\nProposition 5. Any generalized (de)stabilization move can be presented as the\ncomposition of one ordinary (de)stabilization move and a few exchange moves. Any\ngeneralized exchange move can be presented as the composition of ordinary exchange\nmoves.\nProof.

This is a particular case of the definition given in the Introduction.\nAn arc-presentations whose rectangular diagram is trivial, split, or composite is\ncalled trivial, split, or composite, respectively.\nThe assertion of Theorem 1 will be a consequence of the following three Propositions.\nProposition 6.

So, we shall be proving all three statements simultaneously.\nThe strategy and methods of the proof are very close to those in Birman\u2013Menasco\nworks [3], [4]. However, we need to concentrate on many technical details, which are\nspecific in our case. This forces us to write a complete proof instead of just using\nexisting results.\nTo begin with, we describe the general outline of the proof.\n1) The assumptions of Propositions 6\u20138 imply the existence of a certain surface\nM : a disk whose boundary is L, a two-sphere that does not intersect L and is\nsuch that there are non-trivial parts of L on both sides of M , or a two-sphere\nthat intersects L twice and cuts L in two non-trivial tangles. We show that\nsuch a surface M , which we call a characteristic surface, can be isotoped to\nsatisfy certain restrictions. Compared to the previous works [3, 4, 6], a new\nthing here is only a restriction on the behaviour of the spanning disk near the\n\n14\n\n\fboundary in the case of the unknot.\n2) We consider the foliation F on M defined by the equation d\u03b8 = 0. We define\nthe complexity c(M ) \u2208 Z of the characteristic surface and show that, if c(M ) >\n0, then the foliation F contains certain patterns. In the case when M is a twosphere we just follow [3, 4], and extend the argument to the case of the disk.\n3) We show that, if F contains a pattern defined at the previous step, then\nthere exists an arc-presentation L\u2032 and a surface M \u2032 such that L\u2032 is obtained\nfrom L by finitely many exchange and destabilization moves, the pair (L\u2032 , M \u2032 )\nis isotopic to (L, M ), the surface M \u2032 satisfies the restrictions introduced at\nStep 1, and we have either c(L\u2032 ) < c(L) or c(L\u2032 ) = c(L) and c(M \u2032 ) < c(M ).\nSimilarly to [3, 4, 6], this is done by using two tricks that are closely related to\nthose introduced by D. Bennequin in [1]. In the unknot case we also need one\nmore, easier, trick that allows to simplify the boundary of a spanning disk.\n4) We notice that, if c(F ) = 0, then we are done, i.e., the arc-presentation L is\ntrivial, split, or composite, respectively.\n\n2.1\n\nCharacteristic surfaces\n\nLet L be an arc-presentation satisfying the assumptions of one of the Propositions 6\u2013\n8. From now on, we shall assume that each arc of the form L \u2229 Dt is smooth, which\nwas not the case under the agreement of Section 1. Let M \u2282 S 3 be\n\u2022 an embedded two-dimensional disk whose boundary is L if L is an arc-presentation of the unknot;\n\u2022 an embedded two-sphere splitting L into two non-empty links if L is a split\nlink;\n\u2022 a factorizing sphere, i.e., an embedded sphere that meets L in two points,\ncutting L into two non-trivial tangles, if L is a composite non-split link.\nIn this case, we call M a characteristic surface for L.\nWe say that a characteristic surface M is admissible if\n\u2022 the surface M is smooth everywhere up to boundary, except at (\u2202M ) \u2229 S\u03c61 ;\n\u2022 M \\ \u2202M intersects the binding circle S\u03c61 transversely at finitely many points;\n\u2022 the foliation F on M \\S\u03c61 defined by d\u03b8 = 0 has only finitely many singularities,\nwhich are points of tangency of M with pages Dt ;\n\u2022 all singularities of F are of Morse type, i.e., local extrema (Fig. 11 b) or saddle\ncritical points (Fig. 11 c) of the (multivalued) function \u03b8|M \\S\u03c61 ;\n\u2022 near any point p \u2208 (\u2202M ) \u2229 S\u03c61 , the foliation F is radial (see Fig. 11 d);\nR\n\u2022 there is at most one point p \u2208 (\u2202M ) \u2229 S\u03c61 at which | \u03b3 d\u03b8| > 2\u03c0, where \u03b3 \u2282 M\nis a proper arc in a small neighbourhood of p such that the endpoints of \u03b3 lie\nin \u2202M on different sides of p. Such a point is called a winding vertex ;\n\n15\n\n\f\u2022 there is at most one point p \u2208 (\u2202M ) \\ S\u03c61 at which the surface M is not\ntransversal to the corresponding page D\u03b8(p) ; at the exceptional point, the\nfoliation F must have a saddle critical point (see Fig. 11 e). If such a saddle\nand a winding vertex are both present, then the winding vertex is an endpoint\nof the edge containing the saddle;\n\u2022 each page Dt contains no more than one of the following:\n\u2013 an arc of L;\n\u2013 a singularity of F|M \\\u2202M ;\n\u2022 if L is a non-split composite link, the two intersection points L \u2229 M are not\nvertices of L.\nThe behaviour of F near a point from (M \\ \u2202M ) \u2229 S\u03c61 is shown in Fig. 11 a).\nThe points of intersection of M with the binding circle, where the foliation F is not\n\nFigure 11: Vertices and singularities of F\n\u2746 \u2701\n\u274d\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u274d\u2746 \u275d\u2701\u271f\u271f\n\u271f\n\u271f \u2701 \u2746\u274d\n\u2745\u274d\n\u2701 \u2745\n\u2746\n\na)\n\n\u272c\u2729\n\u2724\u271c\n\u2717\u2714\n\u2711\n\u2712\n\u270e\u261e\n\u2715\n\u2716\n\u2722\ns\u2723\n\u275d\ns\u2710\n\u271c\n\u2724\n\u2714\n\u2717\n\u270d\u270c\n\u270f\n\u2713 \u271f\u271f\u2701 \u2746\u274d\n\u2745\u274d\n\u2716\u2715\n\u2723\u2722\n\u2701 \u2745\n\u2746\n\u272b\u272a\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nd)\n\ns\u2724\n\u271c\n\u2714\n\u2717\n\u270f\n\u2713\n\ne)\n\ndefined, will be called vertices of F. Sometimes we will distinguish between interior\nand boundary vertices that lie in M \\ \u2202M and \u2202M , respectively. The singularities of\nF shown in Fig. 11 b,c,e will be called a pole, a(n interior) saddle, and a boundary\nsaddle, respectively.\nLemma 1. For any arc-presentation satisfying the assumptions of one of the Propositions 6\u20138, there exists an admissible characteristic surface.\nProof. In the case of a split link or a composite link, there is almost nothing to\nprove: a characteristic surface is admissible if it is in general position with respect\nto the binding circle, to the link, and to the foliation of S 3 \\ S\u03c61 by disks Dt .\nIn the case of unknot, the admissibility of M means something more than just\ngeneral position. By a small perturbation of an arbitrary characteristic surface M ,\nwe can achieve that M satisfy almost all the restrictions. The only thing that we\nmay not avoid in this way is that F have many boundary saddles, whereas we allow\nit to have just one.\nNotice, that if the number of vertices of an arc-presentation of the unknot is\nodd, then the foliation on the spanning disk is forced to have a boundary saddle,\nsince the parity of the number of boundary saddles should be equal to that of the\nnumber of boundary vertices. Indeed, the coorientation of \u2202M defined by grad \u03b8\nflips at each vertex and at each boundary saddle, so, in total there should be an\neven number of them.\nIn order to avoid the occurrence of many boundary saddles, we shall construct\nthe disk M , starting from a small neighbourhood of the boundary. We construct\n\n16\n\n\finitially a narrow ribbon R \u223c\n= [0, 1] \u00d7 S 1 such that \u2202R = L \u222a L\u2032 , where L\u2032 is a circle\nunlinked with L, and the foliation on R defined by d\u03b8 = 0 has the desired behaviour\nnear L. Then we attach a two-dimensional disk along L\u2032 , obtaining a characteristic\nsurface M . Finally, we deform M slightly if necessary, keeping it fixed in a small\nneighbourhood of L = \u2202M , so that, after deformation, M \\ \u2202M will be in general\nposition. So, the only thing to explain is how to construct the ribbon R.\nNotice that constructing the ribbon R is not equivalent to specifying a trivial\nframing of L. It would have been so if L were a smooth curve.\nWe start by enumerating the vertices s1 , s2 , . . . , sn \u2208 S\u03c61 and arcs \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n of\nL in the order that they follow in L:\n\u2202\u03b1i = {si , si+1 },\n\nif\n\ni = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1,\n\nand \u2202\u03b1n = {sn , s1 }.\n\nDenote by ru the rotation of S 3 about the binding circle by the angle u: ru (\u03c6, \u03c4, \u03b8) =\n(\u03c6, \u03c4, \u03b8 + u). For an arc \u03b1 \u2282 Dt , we denote by d\u03b5 (\u03b1) the disk\n[\nru (\u03b1), if \u03b5 > 0\nu\u2208[0,\u03b5]\n\nand\n\n[\n\nru (\u03b1),\n\nif \u03b5 < 0.\n\nu\u2208[\u03b5,0]\n\nTake a point p in the arc \u03b1n . Let \u03b1\u2032n , \u03b1\u2032\u2032n be the two parts of the arc \u03b1 cut by p:\n\u2202\u03b1\u2032n = {sn , p}, \u2202\u03b1\u2032\u2032n = {p, s1 }. Pick an \u03b5 > 0 which is smaller than the \u03b8-distance\nbetween any two neighbouring arcs. Consider the union R1 of the following disks:\nd\u03b5 (\u03b11 ), d\u2212\u03b5 (\u03b12 ), d\u03b5 (\u03b13 ), . . . , d(\u22121)n \u03b5 (\u03b1n\u22121 ), d(\u22121)n+1 \u03b5 (\u03b1\u2032n ), d\u2212\u03b5 (\u03b1\u2032\u2032n ).\nIf n is even, the last two disks form the disk d\u2212\u03b5 (\u03b1n ). If n is odd, then the intersection\nof R1 with a neighbourhood of the point p will look as shown in Fig. 12 on the left.\nWe attach a small disk \"perpendicular\" to \u03b1n along the segment {ru (p)}u\u2208[\u2212\u03b5,\u03b5] and\n\nFigure 12: The ribbon R near a boundary saddle\n\n\u03b1n\u2032\n\nr\n\np\n\n\u260e\n\n\u03b1n\u2032\u2032\nD\u03b8(p)\n\nr\n\n\u2704\n\nthen smooth the obtained surface as shown in Fig. 12 on the right, still denoting\nthe result by R1 . The point p will be the only boundary saddle of F.\nThe union R1 of disks is only a part of the ribbon under construction. Near any\nvertex, R1 looks as shown in Fig. 13 on the left. We transform it into a ribbon as\nshown in Fig. 13 in the middle, attaching a sector of a small disk transversal to the\nbinding circle. If we do this near each vertex, then, possibly, the obtained ribbon\n\n17\n\n\fFigure 13: The ribbon R near a vertex\nof L\n\u272c\u2729\n\n\u275c\u2764\u2764\u2764\n\u2764\n\u2764\n\u274a\n\u274a\n\u274a\n\u274a\u274a\n\n\u275c\n\n\u274a\n\n\u274a\u274a\n\n\u2764\u2764\n\u2764\n\u2722\n\n\u2724\n\u271c\n\u2717\n\u2714\n\u2713\u270f\n\u275c\n\u270d \u2706\n\u2712\n\u271a \u270c\n\u2727\n\nwill be twisted, that is, the connected components of \u2202R will be linked. We can\ncompensate this by twisting the ribbon around the binding circle \"in the opposite\ndirection\" at an arbitrarily chosen vertex as shown in Fig. 13 on the right. This\nwill create a winding vertex, so, if a boundary saddle is present, we do this at one\nof the boundary vertices adjacent to the saddle.\n\n2.2\n\nMoves of the characteristic surface\n\nWe will think about an admissible characteristic surface M of an arc-presentation\nL as a periodic flow of planar pictures that are intersections of M with the pages\nDt , t \u2208 S 1 . The pages Dt containing singularities of F and arcs of L will be called\nsingular, the corresponding values of t critical. All the others are regular.\nFor simplicity, we assume in this subsection that F has no poles and no closed\nregular fibres. The notions and the claims of this subsection will be used only when\npoles and closed fibres are absent.\nIf Dt is a regular page, then the intersection Dt \u2229 (L \u222a M ) is the union of pairwise\nnon-intersecting arcs having endpoints on the binding circle S\u03c61 = \u2202Dt . Notice that\ntwo arcs in Dt \u2229 M may have a common endpoint if L is an arc-presentation of\nthe unknot (refer to the right picture in Fig. 13), but no arc forms a loop, which\nfollow from an orientation argument. Each section Dt \u2229 (L \u222a M ) will be regarded\nup to a homeomorphism of Dt fixed at \u2202Dt , which we shall express by saying that\nwe consider the combinatorial type of the section Dt \u2229 (L \u222a M ). This combinatorial\ntype can be specified by listing pairs of endpoints of all arcs in Dt , like: si1 si2 , si3 si4 ,\nsi5 si6 , . . . . The notation si sj will be used for any arc with endpoints si , sj \u2208 S\u03c61 .\nNotice: si sj = sj si , but (si , sj )\u2229(sj , si ) = \u2205. We shall also refer to the combinatorial\ntype of a section Dt \u2229 (L \u222a M ) as a state of (L, M ).\nWe leave the following statement, which is standard, without proof.\nProposition 9. Let M and M \u2032 be admissible characteristic surfaces for arc-presentations L and L\u2032 , respectively, such that we have L\u2229S\u03c61 = L\u2032 \u2229S\u03c61 , M \u2229S\u03c61 = M \u2032 \u2229S\u03c61 ,\nand for all t \u2208 S\u03b81 , the sections Dt \u2229 (L \u222a M ) and Dt \u2229 (L\u2032 \u222a M \u2032 ) have the same\ncombinatorial type. Then there is an isotopy f fixed at S\u03c61 , preserving each page Dt ,\nand taking (L, M ) to (L\u2032 , M \u2032 ).\nIf Dt is a regular page, then the combinatorial type of the section Dt \u2229 (L \u222a M )\ndoes not change if t varies slightly. In addition to simple arcs, a singular page may\ncontain one of the following:\n1) a T-joint, which is a boundary saddle of F with three arcs attached;\n\n18\n\n\f2) an X-joint, which is either an interior saddle of F with four arcs attached or\na regular fibre of F crossed by an arc of L (in the case of a composite link).\nWhen t passes a critical value, the state of (L, M ) changes. We shall call such a\nchange an event. Below is the list of all possible events.\nEvent\na single arc appears and\nimmediately disappears\na single arc appears\na single arc disappears\nan arc s1 s2 is replaced\nby some arc s2 s3\ntwo arcs s1 s2 , s3 s4 are\nreplaced by s1 s4 , s2 s3\n\nSingularity\nan arc of L\nan arc of L\nan arc of L\nan arc s1 s3 of L containing a boundary saddle\na saddle of F\n\nCase\nsplit link,\nlink\nunknot\nunknot\nunknot\n\ncomposite\n\nany\n\nIf an arc with endpoints s, s\u2032 \u2208 S\u03c61 is contained in Dt \u2229 (L \u222a M ), where Dt is a\nsingular page, but there is no arc with endpoints s, s\u2032 \"just before\" or \"just after\"\nthe corresponding events, i.e., in the section Dt\u2212\u03b5 \u2229(L\u222aM ) or Dt+\u03b5 \u2229(L\u222aM ), where\n\u03b5 is sufficiently small, we shall say that the arc ss\u2032 participates in the corresponding\nevent.\nClearly, if we know the state of (L, M ) just before an event and have a description\nof the event in terms of the participating arcs, then we can recover the state of\n(L, M ) right after the event. So, in order to specify the combinatorial type of an\narc-presentation L with a characteristic surface M , we must describe the state of\n(L, M ) at just one non-critical moment and provide the ordered list of all the events\nthat occur when t runs over the circle. Such a state with a list of events will be\ncalled combinatorial description of (L, M ).\nWe shall use combinatorial descriptions whenever we will need to change the\nsurface M or an arc-presentation L. Of course, an arbitrary initial state equipped\nwith an ordered list of events does not necessarily define an arc-presentation and\na characteristic surface; the combinatorial data must be consistent. It is easy, but\ntedious, to list all the requirements for the data to be consistent. Here are some\nof them: the final state (to which we come after all the events) must coincide with\nthe initial one, an arc that is supposed to disappear in a forthcoming event must be\npresent just before the event, etc. In each case when we change the combinatorial\ndescription of the pair (L, M ), it will be clear that the combinatorial data remain\nconsistent.\nLemma 2. Let E1 , E2 be successive events such that no arc participating in E1\ncoincides or interleaves with an arc participating in E2 . If both events correspond to\narcs of L, we assume additionally that those arcs do not have a common endpoint.\nThen the events can be interchanged, which will have no effect on the foliation F and\nthe isotopy class of (L, M ). If both singular pages corresponding to the events E1 , E2\ncontain an arc of L, then the exchange of events will result in one arc exchange move\non L. Otherwise, there will be no effect on the combinatorial type of L.\nProof. More precisely, the first assertion means the following. Let t1 = \u03b8(E1 ) and\nt2 = \u03b8(E2 ) be the time of the events. Then there exists an arc-presentation L\u2032 and\n\n19\n\n\fan admissible characteristic surface M \u2032 for L\u2032 such that, for all t \u2208 (t2 , t1 ) the states\nof (L, M ) and (L\u2032 , M \u2032 ) at the moment t coincide. At the moments t1 , t2 , the events\nE2 , E1 , respectively, happen with Dt \u2229 (L\u2032 \u222a M \u2032 ), and there is no event in between.\nBy saying that a transform has no effect on the foliation F, we mean that the\nnew foliation F \u2032 is equivalent to F via a homeomorphism M \u2192 M \u2032 .\nThe assumptions of the lemma imply that there exists a continuous family of\narcs \u03b3t,s1 ,s2 \u2282 Dt , t \u2208 (t1 \u2212 \u03b5, t2 + \u03b5), \u2202\u03b3t,s1 ,s2 = {s1 , s2 } \u2282 S\u03c61 , forming an open\ndisk d that does not intersect the surface M and the link L, such that the event E1\noccurs \"on the right\" of the disk d and the event E2 occurs \"on the left\" of d. The\nlatter means, in particular, that all arcs participating in E1 (respectively, E2 ) have\nboth endpoints on the interval [s1 , s2 ] (respectively, in [s2 , s1 ]). It is not forbidden\nthat an arc participating in the events have one or both endpoints on {s1 , s2 }. If s1\nand s2 are the endpoints of an arc participating in E1 or E2 , the interior of the arc\nmust be on the appropriate side of \u03b3t,s1 ,s2 , where the corresponding event occurs.\nNow we can define a self-homeomorphism f of S 3 \\ d preserving the foliation\nd\u03b8 = 0 by making the time \u03b8 \"go faster\" on the left of d and \"go slower\" on\nthe right of d, which will result in E2 occurring before E1 . In the pages Dt with\nt \u2208 [t2 + \u03b5, t1 \u2212 \u03b5] the mapping f is assumed to be identical. The mapping f will\nsend the surface M to another one, preserving the foliation. Clearly, the mapping\nf can be adjusted in a small neighbourhood of d to become a self-homeomorphism\nof the whole S 3 .\nThe last two assertions of the lemma are obvious.\nRemark 5. We do not exclude the case when an arc participating in E1 has a\ncommon endpoint with one participating in E2 . This may occur when L is an arcpresentation of the unknot, \u2202M = L, and the common end of two arcs is a winding\nvertex of F (refer again to Fig. 13). This is why we wrote [s1 , s2 ] and [s2 , s1 ] instead\nof (s1 , s2 ), (s2 , s1 ) in the above proof.\nWhereas the transform described in Lemma 2 generalizes an arc exchange move\nto the case of an arc-presentation endowed with an admissible characteristic surface,\nthe following construction is an analogue of a generalized exchange move.\nLemma 3. Let s1 , s2 , s3 be three points of S\u03c61 disjoint from L and M such that\ns2 \u2208 (s1 , s3 ). Suppose that there exist moments t1 , t2 \u2208 S\u03b81 such that no arc in\nDt \u2229 (L \u222a M ) interleaves with s1 s2 if t \u2208 [t1 , t2 ] and with s2 s3 if t \u2208 [t2 , t1 ]. Then\none can interchange all the vertices of L and F lying in (s1 , s2 ) with those in (s2 , s3 ),\nkeeping the relative order of vertices in each of the intervals fixed, without change\nin the foliation F and of the isotopy class of (L, M ).\nInterchanging the vertices should be understood in the same way as described\nin 1.6.\nProof. Denote by dt1 ,t2 ,s1 ,s2 ,s3 a closed two-dimensional disk whose interior consists\nof the vertex s2 and the following four disks d1 , d2 , d3 , d4 adjacent to s2 :\nd1 = \u222at\u2208(t1 ,t2 ) \u03b3t,s1 ,s2 ,\n\nd2 = \u222at\u2208(t2 ,t1 ) \u03b3t,s2 ,s3 ,\n\nd3 d4 are the two \"triangles\" bounded by \u03b3ti ,s1,s2 , \u03b3ti ,s2 ,s3 , \u03b3ti ,s1 ,s3 , where i = 1, 2.\n\n20\n\n\fThe assumptions of the Lemma imply that the disk d(1) = dt1 ,t2 ,s1 ,s2,s3 is disjoint\nfrom L and M . Let L\u2032 and M \u2032 be the arc-presentation and the surface obtained after\nthe transform. Then the disk d(2) = dt2 ,t1 ,s1 ,s1 +s3 \u2212s2 ,s3 is disjoint from L\u2032 and M \u2032 . It\nis easy to see that there exists a homeomorphism f : S 3 \\ d(1) \u2192 S 3 \\ d(2) preserving\neach page Dt and interchanging the intervals (s1 , s2 ) and (s2 , s3 ) of the binding\ncircle. We have f (L) = (L\u2032 ) and f (M ) = M \u2032 . There is a small neighbourhood\nU of d(1) that does not meet L and M . By adjusting f in U we can make f a\nself-homeomorphism of the whole sphere S 3 .\n\n2.3\n\nPatterns of F that are always present\n\nLet L be an arc-presentation, M an admissible characteristic surface of L, and F\nthe foliation on M defined by d\u03b8 = 0. We define the complexity c(M ) of M as the\ntotal number of singularities of F.\nFibres of F are of the following types:\n\u2022 a closed circle;\n\u2022 an open arc connecting two vertices;\n\u2022 an open arc connecting a vertex to a saddle or a saddle to itself (we call such\na fibre a separatrix );\n\u2022 a singular point of F.\nTwo regular fibres connecting the same pair of vertices will called parallel if\nthey are included into a continuous family of such fibres (i.e. enclose a disk with\nno singularity inside). Any other two fibres connecting vertices will be called nonparallel.\nFor a vertex v of F, we call the closure of the union of all fibres of F approaching\nv the star of v. By the valence of v we mean the number of separatrices in the star\nof v, which coincides with the number of saddles in the star.\nAn interior vertex v of F is said to be bad in three cases: 1) the star of v contains\nat least two non-parallel fibres each connecting v to a boundary vertex; 2) the star\nof v is pierced by L; 3) the star of v contains a winding vertex. If a vertex is not\nbad, it is said to be good.\nEach saddle x will be endowed with an orientation, which is the circular order\nof the separatrices approaching x induced by the order of the corresponding vertices\non the axis S\u03c61 , see Fig. 14.\nNow we consider the star of a winding vertex in more detail.\nRemark 6. It was brought to the author's attention by Bill Menasco and Adam\nSikora that the presence of a winding vertex in the star of a good two-valent vertex\nmay produce an obstruction to applying the corresponding generalized exchange\nmove in the proof of Lemma 6. The definitions of the characteristic surface and a\nbad vertex have been changed, the new Lemma 4 below has been added, Lemma 5\nand the proof of Lemma 6 have been modified by introducing new cases 6)\u20138) in\norder correct the mistake in the earlier version of the paper.\nSuppose that M has a winding vertex. Denote it by sw and its star by \u03c3 w .

If there is a boundary saddle,\nw\nw\nwe assume that it is adjacent to sw\nq and denote it by xq . Thus, the valence of s is\nequal to\n(\nq \u2212 1 if there is no boundary saddle,\nq\u2032 =\nq otherwise.\n\nNote that if a vertex from \u03c3 w is connected to sw by two or more non-parallel\nw\nw\nfibres, it will appear in the sequence sw\n1 , . . . , sq more than once. So, some of the si\nmay coincide.\nWe also introduce the oriention of the winding vertex, which is either a locally\n\u03b8-increasing or a locally \u03b8-decreasing linear ordering \u227a of fibres approaching sw .\n(This orientation is not the one induced by the orientation of S\u03b81 , which is often\nused in the work of Birman and Menasco.) Take an arbitrary page Dt such that at\nleast two arcs in Dt \u2229 M have sw as an endpoint. Let \u03b1 = \u03b3t,sw ,swi , \u03b2 = \u03b3t,sw ,swj , be\nw w\nsuch arcs. We orient sw so as to have \u03b1 \u227a \u03b2 if and only if sw\ni \u2208 (s , sj ), see Fig. 15.\nThis orientation does not depend on the choice of the page Dt and of the pair \u03b1, \u03b2\n\nFigure 15: Orientation of the winding vertex\n\u272c\n\n\u271b\n\nsw\n\n\u03b1\u2718\n\nsw\ni\n\n\u272c\n\n\u03b2\u2729\nDt\n\nsw\nj\n\ns\u275cw\nj\n\n\u275c\n\u03b2\n\u274d \u03b1\n\u274d\u274d \u2713\u270f\n\u274d\u274d \u275c \u2744\n\nsw\ni\n\n\u2732\n\nM\n\n\u2729\n\nsw\n\nS\u03c61\n\nin Dt , and can be described informally as follows. A small part of the surface M\nnear the winding vertex forms a \"screw\" whose axis is S\u03c61 . The orientation of sw\nindicates which way this screw must rotate in order to screw up in the direction\nopposite to the orientation of S\u03c61 .\nNow we put \u03b4i = +1, if the saddle xw\ni is coherently oriented with the winding\nvertex, and \u03b4i = \u22121 otherwise.\nw\nLemma 4.

Similarly, let \u03c82 be the \u03b8-angle between\nw\nseparatrices sxw\ni\u22121 and sxi+1 at s.\nIt is not hard to see that \u03c81 + \u03c82 = 4\u03c0 (see Fig. 16). Since s is not a winding\nvertex, we have \u03c82 < 2\u03c0. Therefore, \u03c81 > 2\u03c0, which implies that some page Dt\ncontains both arcs \u03b3t,sw ,swi and \u03b3t,sw ,swi+1 .\nw w\nw\nIf sw\ni \u2208 (s , si+1 ), then the orientations of the saddle xi and of the winding\nw\nvertex are both clockwise (according to Fig. 16). If si+1 \u2208 (sw , sw\ni ), then both\norientations are counterclockwise. So, in both cases they are coherent.\n\nThe following lemma is a generalization of Lemma 2 of [3]. (Although closed\nbraids are now replaced with arc-presentations, the argument of [3] does not need\nto be changed to establish the claim below in the case of a split or composite link.)\nLemma 5. If we have c(M ) > 0, then the foliation F has at least one of the\nfollowing:\n1) a pole;\n2) a univalent boundary vertex ;\n3) a good two-valent interior vertex ;\n4) a good three-valent interior vertex ;\n5) two pairs of two-valent vertices, in each the vertices are connected by a fibre\nof F intersecting L;\nw\n6) a winding vertex and a three-valent interior vertex sw\ni in \u03c3 ;\nw\n7) a winding vertex and a two-valent boundary vertex sw\ni in \u03c3 such that \u03b4i\u22121 = \u03b4i ;\nw\n8) a winding vertex and a four-valent interior vertex sw\ni in \u03c3 such that \u03b4i\u22121 = \u03b4i .\n\n23\n\n\fProof. We denote by \u03c7 the Euler characteristic of M , \u03c7 \u2208 {1, 2}. We also set \u01eb = 1\nif F has a boundary saddle, and \u01eb = 0 otherwise. Denote the number of interior\nvertices of valence k by Vk , the number of boundary vertices of valence k by Vkb , the\nnumber of interior saddles by S, and the number of poles by P . By the definition\nof complexity, we have\nS + P + \u01eb = c(M ).\n(2)\nNotice that we always have V1 = 0. Indeed, the opposite would mean that there\nis an event E in the flow Dt \u2229 (L \u222a M ) corresponding to a saddle such that some\narc participating in E and existing just before the event survives after the event,\nwhich is impossible. Notice also that either V0 > 0 or V0b > 0 imply c(M ) = 0: if\nthere is no singularity in the star of a vertex, then this star is the whole surface M ,\nand there are exactly two vertices, either interior or boundary ones.\nThus, we may assume that V0 = V0b = V1 = 0. If P > 0, then case 1) takes\nplace, and we are done. So, we assume P = 0.\nCounting the topological indices of singularities gives\nX\n\nVk +\n\n\u01eb\n1X b\nVk \u2212 S \u2212 = \u03c7.\n2\n2\n\n(3)\n\nk\n\nk\n\nCounting the number of separatrices in two different ways gives\nX\nk(Vk + Vkb ) = 4S + 3\u01eb.\n\n(4)\n\nFrom (3) and (4) we get\nX\nX\n(4 \u2212 k)Vk +\n(2 \u2212 k)Vkb = 4\u03c7 \u2212 \u01eb.\n\n(5)\n\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\n(i) First, consider the case of a split link, which is the simplest one because, in\nthis case, there are no boundary vertices and no bad vertices. Relation (5) can be\nrewritten as\nX\n2V2 + V3 = 8 +\n(k \u2212 4)Vk ,\n(6)\nk>4\n\nwhich implies\n2V2 + V3 > 8.\n\n(7)\n\nWe have either V2 > 0 or V3 > 0, which are Cases 3) and 4) of the lemma.\n(ii) The case of a composite link is similar, but now the inequality (7) does not\nimply that there exists a good three- or two-valent vertex, because some vertices are\nbad. There may be at most four bad vertices. So, either there exists a good threeor two-valent vertex or we have V2 + V3 6 4. In conjunction with (7), the latter\nimplies V2 = 4, V3 = 0, i.e., all bad vertices are two-valent. This is case 5) of the\nlemma.\nRemark 7. In this case, we also have V5 = V6 = . . . = 0, but not necessarily V4 = 0.\nOne can show that V4 must be even, but it can be arbitrarily large. The case V4 > 0\nis missing in [3] and also in [6].\n\n24\n\n\f(iii) Now we consider the case of the unknot. Relation (5) reads:\nX\nX\n2V2 + V3 + V1b = 4 \u2212 \u01eb +\n(k \u2212 4)Vk +\n(k \u2212 2)Vkb .\nk>4\n\n(8)\n\nk>2\n\nIf V1b > 0, then case 2) of the lemma takes place.\nSuppose that V1b = 0. Then it follows from (8) that 2V2 + V3 > 0. If all vertices\nare good (and hence there is no winding vertex), we are done: either case 3) or 4)\nof the lemma takes place.\n(iii.a) Assume that some vertices of F are bad, but there is no winding vertex. In\neach family of parallel fibres of F connecting a bad vertex with a boundary vertex,\nwe select one fibre and cut the surface M along all the selected arcs (see Fig. 17).\nLet d1 , . . . , dl be the obtained disks. We say that a disk di is terminal if there is\n\nFigure 17: Cutting the disk M\n\u2605\u2605\n\u2725 \u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\u2605\n\u2745\n\u275c \u270f\u2745 \u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c \u2711 \u275c\n\u2727\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u2725\n\u275c\n\n\u2726\n\n\u2726\n\nexactly one bad vertex of F in \u2202di . Clearly, there should be at least two terminal\ndisks (e.g., there are six in Fig. 17). Therefore, we can find a terminal disk di such\nthat \u2202di does not contain the boundary saddle of F. Let d1 be that disk.\nConsider the restriction Fe of the foliation F to the disk d1 . Let Vek and Vekb be the\ne respectively. By analogy\nnumber of interior and boundary k-valent vertices of F,\nwith (8), we have\nX\nX\n2Ve2 + Ve3 + Ve1b = 4 +\n(k \u2212 4)Vek +\n(k \u2212 2)Vekb > 4.\nk>4\n\nk>2\n\nSince V1b = 0 and the disk d1 is terminal, we have Ve1b 6 3, which implies 2Ve2 +Ve3 > 1.\nThus, there is at least one two- or three-valent interior vertex in d1 . By construction,\nthis vertex is a good vertex of F, so, one of the cases 3) or 4) takes place.\n(iii.b) Now assume that there is a winding vertex, but no boundary saddle (i.e.\nw\n\u01eb = 0). Assume also that all vertices sw\ni in \u03c3 are pairwise distinct and that Cases\nbw\nw\n6)\u20138) don't occur. Let Vk (respectively, Vk ) be the number of k-valent interior\n(respectively, boundary) vertices of F that lie in \u03c3 w . Consider the sequence \u2206 =\n(\u03b41 , \u03b42 , . . . , \u03b4q\u2032 ) of \u00b11s defined above. Let m+ (respectively, m\u2212 ) be the number of\n+1s (respectively, \u22121s) in \u2206, and let m\u2212\u2212 be the number of subsequences (\u22121, \u22121)\nin \u2206. We have\nm\u2212\u2212 > m\u2212 \u2212 m+ \u2212 1.\n(9)\nWhenever we have a subsequence of the form (\u03b4i\u22121 , \u03b4i ) = (\u22121, \u22121) in \u2206, the vertex\nsw\ni cannot be\n\n25\n\n\f\u2022 a two-valent interior vertex, since two saddles in the star of such a vertex must\nbe incoherently oriented (see [3]);\n\u2022 a k-valent interior vertex with 2 < k < 5 or a two-valent boundary vertex, by\nthe assumption that cases 6)\u20138) do not occur.\nThus the vertex sw\ni can be only a k-valent interior vertex with k > 5 or a k-valent\nboundary vertex with k > 3. Taking into account that the winding vertex itself has\nvalence q \u2032 = m+ + m\u2212 > 2, we obtain from (9):\nX\nX\n(k \u2212 4)Vkw +\n(10)\n(k \u2212 2)Vkbw > m\u2212\u2212 + q \u2032 \u2212 2 > 2m\u2212 \u2212 3.\nk>5\n\nk>3\n\nIt follows from Lemma 4 that\nV2w 6 m\u2212 .\n\n(11)\n\nCombining (5), (10), (11), and recalling that V1b = 0, we obtain:\nX\nX\n2(V2 \u2212 V2w ) + V3 = 4 +\n(k \u2212 4)Vk +\n(k \u2212 2)Vkb \u2212 2V2w\nk>5\n\nk>3\n\nX\nX\n>4+\n(k \u2212 4)Vkw +\n(k \u2212 2)Vkbw \u2212 2V2w > 1,\nk>5\n\nk>3\n\nwhich implies that there is a two- or three-valent interior vertex in M \\ \u03c3 w . We\nare done unless there are bad vertices in M \\ \u03c3 w . In the latter case, we apply\nthe same cutting as in case (iii.a) and note that the presence of a bad vertex in\nM \\ \u03c3 w implies that one can find a terminal disk whose interior is disjoint from \u03c3 w .\nSince the winding vertex is away from such a terminal disk, we can apply the same\nargument as in case (iii.a).\n(iii.c) Now let both a winding vertex and a boundary saddle be present, but still\nassume that the vertices sw\ni are all distinct. Recall that, in this case, the boundary\nsaddle lies in \u03c3 w by construction.

The equalities\nC = 0, \u03b4q = \u22121, and Lemma 4 imply that sw\nq is two-valent. Let s be the boundary\n\n26\n\n\fvertex different from sw adjacent to the boundary saddle. This vertex is not in \u03c3 w ,\nso its valence must be equal to two (otherwise we would have A > 0). Therefore,\nw\nthe star of s does not contain any saddle except xw\nq and xq\u22121 , which implies that\nw\nsq\u22121 is a boundary vertex connected to s by an arc of L, see Fig. 18.

As we\nhave just seen, the existence of such an r follows from (12). Let us cut the disk M\nalong a regular fibre connecting sw and sw\nr into two disks. Let d be the one of the\nw\ntwo that contains s1 , see Fig. 19.\nIf sw becomes a univalent boundary vertex of d (i.e., r = 2), then its star \u03c3 w \u2229 d\nin d contains no interior vertices, and F|d has at most two univalent boundary\nvertices, so we can apply the argument of case (iii.a) to show that there is a good\ntwo- or three-valent interior vertex in d. Let us assume that the valence of sw in d\nis larger than one.\nIf sw\nr is not a univalent boundary vertex of d, then we can apply the argument\nof case (iii.b) to d without any change.\n\u2032\nw\nIf sw\nr is a univalent boundary vertex of d, let s be the vertex adjacent to xr\u22121 but\nw\nw\nw\ndifferent from s , sr\u22121 , sr . Let us cut off a \"triangle\" whose \"hypotenuse\" consists\nw\n\u2032\nof separatrices connecting xw\nr\u22121 to s and to s from the disk d. By assumption,\nw\n\u2032\nafter the cutting, s and s become boundary vertices of valence at least two. Thus,\nthe restriction of F to the smaller disk has a boundary saddle and no univalent\nboundary vertices. So, we can repeat our reasoning above for this disk and show\nthat sw\nr\u22121 is a boundary vertex, a contradiction.\n(iii.d) Finally, suppose that some of the vertices sw\ni , i = 1, . . . , q coincide.

Let L be an arc-presentation satisfying the assumptions of one of the\nPropositions 6\u20138, M an admissible characteristic surface for L such that c(M ) > 0.\nThen there exist an arc-presentation L\u2032 and an admissible characteristic surface M \u2032\nfor L\u2032 such that one of the following takes place\n1) L\u2032 is obtained from L by finitely many exchange moves, and we have c(M \u2032 ) <\nc(M );\n2) L\u2032 that is obtained from L by finitely many exchange moves and one destabilization move.\nProof. It suffices to show how to obtain L\u2032 , M \u2032 in each case listed in Lemma 5. In\nCases 1, 3, 4 we just follow [3, 4, 6] and show additionally that the transformation\nL 7\u2192 L\u2032 can be decomposed into elementary moves. Case 2 is specific in our situation.\nIn cases 5, 6, 7, and 8 our actions will be similar to those in Cases 3 and 4. In Case 5,\nwe also consider a situation not covered by [3, 4, 6]. Two tricks play important r\u00f4le\nhere: changing the valence of a vertex (Cases 4 through 8) and reducing a pair\nof vertices one of which is two-valent (Cases 3 and 5) by using \"global exchange\"\nfrom Lemma 3. These tricks are the same in nature as those that were used by\nBennequin's in [1] to prove an inequality relating the knot genus, the number of\nstrands, and the crossing number of a braid representing the knot.\n\n28\n\n\fRemark 8. The Reeb foliation in S 3 , which Bennequin considers, is different from\nours and from the one used in [3, 4, 6]. Our foliation d\u03b8 = 0 can be obtained from\nthe Reeb foliation by contracting one of the solid tori bounded by the compact leaf\ninto a circle, which becomes our circle S\u03c61 . This difference between foliations turns\nout to be unimportant for the arguments that are used to show that the foliation F\ncan be modified in a prescribed way once we know that it contains a certain pattern.\nCase 1: F has a pole.\nWe remove all poles and closed fibres of the foliation F. The obtained surface has\nnew boundary components, each consisting of a saddle and a separatrix and lying\nin a page Dt . For such boundary component \u03b3, we attach a disk bounded by \u03b3\nthat lies in Dt to the surface and then deform the result slightly to obtain a smooth\nsurface. The saddle singularity at \u03b3 disappears (see Fig. 20). The complexity of the\n\nFigure 20: Removing poles and closed fibres\n\u272c\u2729\n\u271b\u2718\n\n\u272c\u2729\n\u2713\u270f\n\u2712\n\u2712\u270f\n\u2712\n\u270f\n\u272b\n\u271b\n\nr\u2712\n\u271a\u270f\n\u272b\n\u271b\n\nsurface is decreased, the surface remains admissible, the link L is untouched.\nIn what follows we assume that there are no poles, and hence, no closed regular\nfibres in F.\nCase 2: F has a univalent boundary vertex.\nLet s1 be a univalent boundary vertex, s2 , s3 the neighbouring vertices to s1 at the\nknot L, \u03b1 and \u03b2 the two arcs of L that connect s1 with s2 and s3 , respectively, and\nx the saddle connected with s1 by a separatrix. The saddle x may be a boundary\nsaddle as well as an interior one.\nSuppose x is a boundary saddle. We may assume without loss of generality that\nx \u2208 \u03b2. The behaviour of the foliation near s1 is shown in Fig. 21 on the left. There\n\nFigure 21: A univalent vertex of F\n\n\u2701\n\u2701\n\n\u2701\n\u275c\u2701\n\n\u2701\n\u2701\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c s3\n\n\u2701\n\u2701 rx\n\ns2 \u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\ns2 \u03b1\n\ns1\n\n29\n\nr\n\n\u275c\n\nx\n\ns1 \u03b2\n\n\u275c\n\ns3\n\n\fis no topological obstruction to slide the arc \u03b1 over M toward x in such a way that,\nat any moment, \u03b1 coincides with a regular fibre of F with endpoints s1 , s2 .\nAs a result of the sliding finitely many arc exchange moves will occur. We move\n\u03b1 until \u03b1 and \u03b2 become neighbouring arcs. When \u03b1 and \u03b2 become neighbours, we\napply a generalized destabilization move.\nIf x is not a boundary saddle, then we do the same thing, but with both arcs \u03b1\nand \u03b2. The star of s1 is shown in Fig. 21 on the right. We slide \u03b1 and \u03b2 toward x\nuntil it becomes possible to apply a generalized destabilization move.\nRemark 9. Note that, once we have applied a destabilization move and the arcpresentation L has become simpler, we forget the surface M and search for a\ncompletely new admissible characteristic surface for the obtained arc-presentation.\nHowever, the new characteristic surface can be found by a modification of the old\none, which may yield in some optimization of the simplification procedure. We do\nnot discuss this in detail because the optimization questions are out of the scope of\nthis paper.\nCase 3: F has a good two-valent interior vertex.\nLet s1 be a good two-valent interior vertex and let x1 , x2 be the two saddles from\nthe star of s1 . There must be also two vertices in the star of s1 . Denote them by\ns2 , s3 . We may assume without loss of generality that s2 is also an interior vertex.\nThe star of s1 is shown in Fig. 22. Let t1 = \u03b8(x1 ), t2 = \u03b8(x2 ). We may also assume\n\nFigure 22: A good two-valent vertex of F\n2r\n\u272c\n\nx\n\n\u2745\n\u2745\u275c\n\ns2\n\ns1\n\n\u275c\n\n\u272br\n\nx1\n\n\u2729\n\u275c\n\ns3\n\n\u272a\n\nthat the section Dt \u2229 M contains the arc \u03b3t,s1 ,s2 when t \u2208 (t1 , t2 ) and the arc \u03b3t,s1 ,s3\nwhen t \u2208 (t2 , t1 ), and we have s1 \u2208 (s2 , s3 ). The other cases are obtained by flipping\nthe orientation of S\u03c61 and/or S\u03b81 .\nIt was pointed out by Bill Menasco and Adam Sikora that it is important to\nknow here that s3 is not a winding vertex. That's why we consider all interior\nvertices in the star of a winding vertex as bad by definition.\nPick a small \u03b5 > 0. No arc in Dt \u2229 (L \u222a M ) will be interleaved with the arc\n(s2 + \u03b5)(s1 \u2212 \u03b5) if t \u2208 [t1 , t2 ] and with (s1 \u2212 \u03b5)(s3 + \u03b5) if t \u2208 (t2 , t1 ). Clearly, if no\narc in Dt \u2229 (L \u222a M ) is interleaved with an arc ss\u2032 , then this remains true under\na small variation of t. So, if \u03b5 is small enough, then no connected component of\nDt \u2229 (L \u222a M ) is interleaved with the arc (s2 + \u03b5)(s1 \u2212 \u03b5) if t \u2208 [t1 \u2212 \u03b5, t2 + \u03b5] and with\n(s1 \u2212 \u03b5)(s3 + \u03b5) if t \u2208 [t2 + \u03b5, t1 \u2212 \u03b5]. Thus, the arc-presentation L and the surface\nM satisfy the assumptions of Lemma 3, where we should replace s1 , s2 , s3 , t1 , t2 by\n\n30\n\n\fs2 + \u03b5, s1 \u2212 \u03b5, s3 + \u03b5, t1 \u2212 \u03b5, t2 + \u03b5, respectively, and we can exchange the intervals\n(s2 + \u03b5, s1 \u2212 \u03b5) and (s1 \u2212 \u03b5, s3 + \u03b5).\nThe new arc-presentation L\u2032 is obtained from L by a generalized exchange move,\nwhich, according to Proposition 5, is the composition of ordinary exchange moves.\nAs a result of the exchange, the vertex s1 is moved to s\u20321 = s2 + 2\u03b5. There is\nno other vertex of L or F in (s2 , s\u20321 ). The foliation of the surface is not changed,\ntherefore, there still exists a regular fibre \u03b1 connecting the vertices s2 and s\u20321 . We\ncan now isotop the surface so that the obtained surface M \u2032 is admissible and we\nhave |M \u2032 \u2229 S\u03c61 | = |M \u2229 S\u03c61 | \u2212 2. In order to see that there is no obstruction, we can\ndo the following. First, we replace the interval (s2 \u2212 \u03b5, s\u20321 + \u03b5) of the binding circle\nby an arc parallel to \u03b1 (see Fig. 23). Then we apply an isotopy that will restore the\nbinding circle.\n\nFigure 23: Simplifying the surface M\ns2 \u275c\n\n\u2701\n\u2701\n\u2701M\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u275c 1\n\u2746\n\u2746\n\u2746\n\ns\u2032\n\nS\u03c61\n\n\u2192\n\u2701\n\u2701\n\n\u2701\u2701\n\n\u2746\u2746\n\n\u2192\n\u2746\n\u2746\n\nS\u03c61\n\u2701\u2701M \u2032\n\n\u2746\u2746\n\nUnder this isotopy, the boundary of the surface stays unchanged. We may also\nassume that the obtained surface M \u2032 is in general position (thus, it is still admissible)\nand there is no poles of the foliation F \u2032 on M \u2032 defined by d\u03b8 = 0. Indeed, if there\nis one, we can apply the procedure described in Case 1) and get rid of all poles and\nclosed fibres of the foliation.\nIn the case P = 0, from (2) and (3) we have\nc(M ) =\n\nX\nk\n\nVk +\n\n1X b \u01eb\nVk + \u2212 \u03c7.\n2\n2\nk\n\nSince the number of boundary vertices of F \u2032 is the same as that of F and the number\nof interior vertices of F \u2032 is less than that of F, we have c(M \u2032 ) < c(M ).\nRemark 10. The operation of removing the vertices s2 , s\u20321 has the following effect\non the combinatorial description of M : in all pages Dt with t \u2208 (t1 , t2 ) the arc s2 s\u20321\ndisappears, in all regular pages Dt with t \u2208 (t2 , t1 ) a pair of arcs one of which is s\u20321 s\u20323\nand the other has the form s2 s is replaced by the arc s\u20323 s, the events at t = t1 , t2\ndisappear, the events in t \u2208 (t2 , t1 ) are adjusted by replacing s2 with s\u20323 .\nCase 4: F has a good three-valent interior vertex.\nLet s1 be a good three-valent vertex and let s2 , s3 , s4 be the other vertices from the\nstar of s1 enumerated so that s2 \u2208 (s1 , s3 ), s4 \u2208 (s3 , s1 ). Let x1 (respectively, x2 )\nbe the saddle (from the star of s1 ) connected by separatrices to s2 , s3 (respectively,\ns3 , s4 ). The star of s1 cannot contain a boundary saddle, since otherwise there\nwould be two boundary vertices in the star, which would contradict to the goodness\nof s1 . Thus, neither of the points x1 , x2 is a boundary saddle. Let s5 and s6 be the\nvertices other than s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 connected by separatrices to x1 and x2 , respectively\n(see Fig. 24).\n\n31\n\n\fFigure 24: Turning a three-valent vertex of F into a two-valent one\ns6 \u275c\ns4\n\ns\u275c3\n\n\u275c s5\n\n\u2745 \u271b\u261e\u2745 \u270e\n\u2745r x1\nx\u2745\n2 r\n\u2732\u2745\n\u2745\u270c \u270d\n\u2745\u275c\n\u2745\u275cs\n\u275c\n\ns1\n\ns6 \u275c\ns4\n\n2\n\n\u270e\u261e\nr \u2744\n\ns\u275c3\n\n\u275c s5\n\u271f\n\u271f\nr\n\u271f\n\u271f\u271f\n\u271f\nr\n\u271f\n\u275c\u271f\n\u275c\n\u275cs\n\ns1\n\n2\n\nr\n\nLet t1 = \u03b8(x1 ), t2 = \u03b8(x2 ). We may assume without loss of generality that \u03b8\nincreases when we go from x1 to x2 transversely to the fibres connecting s1 and s3 .\nIn other words, we have \u03b3t,s1 ,s3 \u2282 M if t \u2208 (t1 , t2 ). Let us now see what we know\nabout the flow of sections Dt \u2229 (L, M ) when t runs over [t1 , t2 ]. The following events\noccur:\nt = t1 : the arcs s1 s2 and s3 s5 are replaced by s1 s3 and s2 s5 ;\nt \u2208 (t1 , t2 ): some unknown events happen, but none of them involves the arc s1 s3 ;\nt = t2 : the arcs s1 s3 and s4 s6 are replaced by s1 s4 and s3 s6 .\nTogether with our assumptions, this implies that the following pairs of arcs are\nnon-interleaving: (s1 s2 , s3 s5 ), (s1 s3 , s2 s5 ), (s1 s3 , s4 s6 ), (s1 s4 , s3 s6 ), which prescribes\nthe following circular order of the vertices in the binding circle: s1 , s2 , s5 , s3 , s6 , s4 .\nSince the unknown events that happen in (t1 , t2 ) do not involve the arc s1 s3 ,\nall the arcs participating in them must have both endpoints either in (s1 , s3 ) or in\n(s3 , s1 ). In the first case, there is no topological obstruction to moving these events\n\"to the future\" so that they happen after t2 . In the latter case, we can move them\n\"to the past\", i.e., before t1 .\nAs a result, finitely many arc exchange moves are applied to L, and an isotopy\npreserving the foliation F to M . The main achievement is this:\n1) there is no event between t1 and t2 ;\n2) all three arcs s1 s2 , s3 s5 and s4 s6 are present at the moment preceding t1 ;\n3) all three arcs s2 s5 , s3 s6 s1 s4 are present right after the moment t2 .\nRemark 11. There is a minor mistake in [6], in the proof of Lemma 3: it is claimed\n(in different terms) that the only obstruction to an isotopy making the events corresponding to x1 , x2 successive are arcs of L. This is not necessarily so, the events\nin the time interval (t1 , t2 ) can be arbitrary, including those corresponding to saddles. In particular, before the exchanges, the arc s2 s5 , which must be present in\nDt1 +\u03b5 \u2229 M for a small \u03b5 may be already absent in Dt2 \u2229 M , being destroyed at some\nmoment t \u2208 (t1 , t2 ).\nNow we replace the couple of events\n(s1 s2 , s3 s5 ) 7\u2192 (s1 s3 , s2 s5 ) followed by (s1 s3 , s4 s6 ) 7\u2192 (s1 s4 , s3 s6 )\n\n32\n\n\fby the following couple of events:\n(s3 s5 , s4 s6 ) 7\u2192 (s3 s6 , s4 s5 ) followed by (s1 s2 , s4 s5 ) 7\u2192 (s1 s4 , s2 s5 ).\nThis results in an isotopy of the surface M and changing the foliation as shown in\nFig. 24 on the right. For more explanations and figures illustrating the change of\nthe surface, see [3].\nAfter the change of the foliation, the vertex s1 becomes two-valent. It remains\ngood because the star of s1 becomes smaller. So, we can now proceed as in the case\nof a good two-valent vertex (Case 3).\nCase 5: F has two pairs two-valent vertices, in each the vertices are connected by a\nfibre intersecting L. This case may occur only when L is a composite link and M is\na factorizing sphere. This case was not considered in full generality in [6], so, here\nwe also fill a gap in the proof given in [6] of the additivity of arc-index.\nLet s1 , s2 be a pair of two-valent vertices connected by a fibre \u03b1 of F that\nintersects L. Since there are exactly two such pairs of vertices and exactly two\npoints in L \u2229 M , the union U of the stars of s1 and s2 is pierced only once. The\nstructure of F in the region U is shown in Fig. 25. The '\u2217' in the Figure stands for\n\nFigure 25: A pierced region\nr\n\nx2\n\ns3\n\n\u275c\n\ns1\n\n\u275c\n\n\u2217\nr\n\n\u275c\n\ns2\n\n\u275c\n\ns4\n\nx1\nthe point L \u2229 U . Let \u03b2 be the arc of L that pierces U and x1 , x2 be the saddles\nfrom U . Let t1 = \u03b8(x1 ), t2 = \u03b8(x2 ), t3 = \u03b8(\u2217).\nLet \u2202\u03b2 = {s5 , s6 }. Since the arcs s1 s2 and s5 s6 interleave, we may assume\ns5 \u2208 (s1 , s2 ) and s6 \u2208 (s2 , s1 ). Denote by \u03b2 \u2032 the arc of L attached to s5 but different\nfrom \u03b2. Let s3 be the vertex from the star of s1 other than s2 , and s4 the vertex\nfrom the star of s2 other than s1 . We can always achieve the following by adjusting\nnotation: s1 \u2208 (s3 , s2 ), s2 \u2208 (s1 , s4 ), t3 \u2208 (t1 , t2 ).\nSuppose that the interval (s1 , s2 ) of the binding circle does not intersect the\nsurface M . Let A1 (respectively, A2 ) be the set of arcs in L that lie in the sector\n\u03b8 \u2208 (t1 , t3 ) (respectively, \u03b8 \u2208 (t3 , t2 )) and have the endpoints in (s1 , s2 ). By using\narc exchange moves, we can shift all the arcs from A1 \"to the past\" (t1 \u2212 \u03b5, t1 ) and\nthe arcs from A2 \"to the future\" (t2 , t2 + \u03b5), keeping the relative order of arcs in\neach family Ai .\nNow, for a sufficiently small \u03b5, we can exchange the intervals of the binding\ncircle: (s1 + \u03b5, s5 \u2212 \u03b5) with (s3 \u2212 \u03b5, s1 + \u03b5), and (s5 + \u03b5, s2 \u2212 \u03b5) with (s2 \u2212 \u03b5, s4 + \u03b5),\nsince the assumptions of Lemma 3 are satisfied. As a result of the exchanges, the\n\n33\n\n\fvertices s1 , s2 are moved to s\u20321 = s5 \u2212 2\u03b5 and s\u20322 = s5 + 2\u03b5, respectively, becoming\nneighbouring to s5 . We can now reduce the number of vertices of F in the same\nway as we did in Case 3. The intersection point \u2217 slides over L from the arc \u03b2 to\n\u03b2 \u2032 (see Fig. 26). The rest of the argument is the same as in Case 3.\n\nFigure 26: Simplifying the surface M near a piercing point\n\u03b2\n\u2217\n\ns\u20321\u275c \u275c \u275cs\u20322\ns5 \u2746\n\u2701\n\n\u2701\n\u2701M\n\n\u03b2\u2032\n\n\u2746\n\nS\u03c61\n\n\u2192\n\u2701\u2701M \u2032\n\n\u2746\n\n\u275c\n\nS\u03c61\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2746\u2746\n\nIt remains to consider the situation in which M intersects the interval (s1 , s2 ) \u2282\nActually, the procedure that has just been considered may work in this case,\ntoo. One should include in A1 , respectively A2 , all the events in (t1 , t3 ), respectively\n(t3 , t2 ), involving arcs with endpoints in (s1 , s2 ). But there is one really bad case,\nwhich really can take place: the arc \u03b2 can intersect the surface M twice. If the\nsecond intersection point lies in the segment of \u03b2 between s5 and \u2217, we cannot\nexchange the intervals. We now show that, in the case when M intersects (s1 , s2 ) \u2282\nS\u03c61 , the surface M can be simplified by using a different method.\nAs we have seen at the proof of Lemma 5, if none of the Cases 1\u20134 occurs, then\nfour of the vertices of the foliation F are two-valent and all the others are fourvalent. It is not difficult to see that, in this case, the surface M can be cut along\nregular non-separatrix fibres of F into two disks and a number of annuli in which\nthe foliation looks as shown in Fig. 27. In the Figure, i runs from 1 through k,\nS\u03c61 .\n\nFigure 27: Patterns of F in Case 5\n\ns2i+1 \u275c\n\n\u275c\n\nr\n\ns2i\u22121\nr\n\ns2i \u275c\n\n\u275c s2i+2\n\ns1 \u275c\n\n\u22171\n\n\u275c s2\n\ns2k\u22121 \u275c\n\n\u22172\n\n\u275c s2k\n\nwhere 2k is the total number of vertices of F. Certainly, we have k > 3, since the\nvertices s3 , s4 do not lie in (s1 , s2 ) by construction. Notice that we have chosen the\nnotation for s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 to be as before; \u22171 and \u22172 stand for the points L \u2229 M .\nFor a moment, we step back to Case 4 and Figure 24. What assumption did we\nuse in the proof that the foliation can be changed as shown in Fig. 24 on the right?\nExamining the proof, one sees that we only needed that the region filled by arcs\n\n34\n\n\fconnecting s1 and s3 was not pierced by L and the arcs s2 s5 and s4 s6 were separated\nfrom each other in the binding circle S\u03c61 by the arc s1 s3 , which is equivalent to saying\nthat the saddles x1 and x2 in Figure 24 are coherently oriented. In the case of a\nthree-valent vertex, we achieved this by appropriately numbering the vertices s2 , s3 ,\nand s4 . But, clearly, we can apply the same procedure in the case of a vertex s1\nsuch that the three vertices s2 , s3 , s4 in the star of s1 viewed from s1 in this order\nsatisfy the condition s3 \u2208 (s2 , s4 ). The effect on the foliation is that the valence of\ns1 is decreased by 1 and the complexity of M is unchanged.\nNow we return to the case of the foliation shown in Fig. 27. For any i =\n1, . . . , k \u2212 2 the foliation F have two copies of the pattern shown in Fig. 28 on the\nleft. If the arcs s2i\u22121 s2i and s2i+3 s2i+4 are separated from each other in S\u03c61 by the\n\nFigure 28: Turning a four-valent vertex into a two-valent one\ns2i\u22121 \u275c\ns2i\n\ns\u275c2i+1\n\n\u275c s2i+3\n\ns2i+2\n\n2i+4\n\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745r\n\u2745r\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\u275cs\n\u2745\u275c\n\u275c\n\ns2i\u22121 \u275c\ns2i\n\n\u275c2i+1\n\u275c s2i+3\n\u271f\u271f\nr\n\u271f\n\u271f\n\u271f\u271f r\n\u271f\n\u275c\u271f\n\u275c\n\u275cs\n\ns\n\ns2i+2\n\n2i+4\n\narc s2i+1 s2i+2 , then we can change the foliation as shown in the Fig. 28 on the right\nby applying the same procedure as in Case 4 to both copies. The vertices s2i+1 and\ns2i+2 will become two-valent, and we can simplify the surface M as in Case 3.\nSo, the only possibility left is that the arcs s2i\u22121 s2i and s2i+3 s2i+4 are not separated by s2i+1 s2i+2 for all i = 1, . . . , k \u2212 2. We now show that, in this case, the\ninterval (s1 , s2 ) is disjoint from M , which contradicts the assumption.\nIn order to help the imagination, we explain informally how the surface M looks\nin the case under consideration. Let C be a simple non-closed curve in S 3 with\nendpoints in S\u03c61 consisting of k \u2212 1 arcs, each lying in a separate page Dt . Let S be\nthe boundary of a small neighbourhood of C. If the neighbourhood has been chosen\nappropriately, then the foliation d\u03b8 = 0 on S looks exactly as that on M . Actually,\nthe surface M can be isotoped to such an S without changes in the foliation and\ncombinatorial structure of L for an appropriately chosen curve C.\nLet Ij be the following interval of the binding circle:\n\u001a\n(s2j\u22121 , s2j ), if j is odd,\nIj =\n(s2j , s2j\u22121 ), if j is even.\nWe want to show that Ii \u2229Ij = \u2205 if i 6= j, which will imply (s1 , s2 )\u2229M = I1 \u2229M = \u2205.\nRecall that the vertices s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 have been numbered so that I1 \u2229 I2 = \u2205.\nSuppose that we have Ii \u2229 Ii+1 = \u2205, i 6 k \u2212 2. There is a saddle of F that\nis connected by separatrices to the vertices s2i+1 , s2i+2 , s2i+4 , s2i+3 in this circular\norder. These vertices must appear in S\u03c61 in the same or in the opposite circular\norder. Since the arcs s2i\u22121 s2i and s2i+3 s2i+4 are not separated by s2i+1 s2i+2 , we\nsee that the vertices s2i+1 , s2i+2 , s2i , s2i\u22121 go in S\u03c61 in the same circular order as the\nvertices s2i+1 , s2i+2 , s2i+4 , s2i+3 do. Therefore, the assumption Ii \u2229 Ii+1 = \u2205 implies\nIi+1 \u2229 Ii+2 = \u2205. Since I1 \u2229 I2 = \u2205, we have Ii \u2229 Ii+1 = \u2205 for all i = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1.\n\n35\n\n\fNow, we show by induction that, for i < j, we have either Ii \u2229 Ij = \u2205 or Ii \u2282 Ij .\nThis is true for i = 1, j = 2. Suppose, this is true for all i < j 6 m. We have\nalready shown that Im \u2229 Im+1 = \u2205. Let i \u2208 {1, . . . , m \u2212 1}. In any regular page Dt\none of the following is present:\n1) the arc s2i\u22121 s2i , which separates Ii from the rest of the binding circle;\n2) the arcs s2i\u22121 s2i+1 and s2i s2i+2 , which separate Ii \u222a Ii+1 from the rest of the\ncircle;\n3) the arcs s2i\u22123 s2i\u22121 and s2i\u22122 s2i , which separate Ii \u222a Ii\u22121 from the rest of the\ncircle.\nIn order to see this, refer to the stars of s2i\u22121 and s2i . One of regular pages contains\nthe arcs s2m\u22121 s2m+1 and s2m s2m+2 . By the induction hypothesis, the vertices s2m\u22121\nand s2m are outside of Ii\u22121 \u222a Ii \u222a Ii+1 . Therefore, the vertices s2m+1 and s2m+2 are\noutside of Ii . This implies Ii \u2229 Im+1 = \u2205 or Ii \u2282 Im+1 .\nFrom the symmetry argument, we conclude that, for any i > j, we also have\neither Ii \u2229 Ij = \u2205 or Ii \u2282 Ij . Therefore, Ii \u2229 Ij = \u2205 for all i 6= j. This concludes\nthe proof of the Lemma in the case of a composite link.\nw\nCase 6: F has a three-valent interior vertex sw\ni in the star of a winding vertex s .\nLet us assume for the moment that there is no boundary saddle. We apply the same\ntrick as in Case 4, changing the valence of the vertex sw\ni to two. The result depends\non whether we have \u03b4i\u22121 = \u03b4i or not. Refer again to Fig. 24, where s1 is the vertex\nsw\ni .\nIf \u03b4i\u22121 = \u03b4i , then according to Fig. 24 the winding vertex must be s3 . As a result\nof the change of the foliation, the vertex s1 , which becomes two-valent, escapes the\nstar of sw . If it becomes good, we proceed as in Case 3. If it is still bad, we can\napply the same argument as in Case (iii.b) of the proof of Lemma 5 to show that\nthere is a good two- or three-valent interior vertex or a one-valent boundary vertex\nsomewhere else, and proceed as in Case 2, 3, or 4 above.\nIf \u03b4i\u22121 6= \u03b4i , then according to Fig. 24 the winding vertex must be s2 or s4 . We\nmay assume that it is s4 . As a result of the change of the foliation the valence of sw\nincreases, whereas the complexity of the disk M does not change. So, after finitely\nmany such operations either all three-valent interior vertices will be removed from\n\u03c3 w or we get a good interior vertex of valence 6 3 or a univalent boundary vertex.\nA slight complication occurs in the case of boundary saddle present, when the\nthree-valent vertex under consideration is sw\nq , and we have \u03b4q\u22121 = \u03b4q . Similarly to\nCase 4, one can show that now the change of the foliation indicated in Fig. 29 is\nw\npossible. The vertex sw\nq will escape the star of s and become two-valent, so, we\ncan proceed as above.\n\nCase 7: F contains a two-valent vertex sw\ni in the star of a winding vertex, and we\nhave \u03b4i\u22121 = \u03b4i . By the same trick as in Case 4 we can change the valence of the\nvertex sw\ni two one, and then simplify the knot as we did in Case 2.\nCase 8: F contains a four-valent interior vertex sw\ni in the star of a winding vertex,\nand we have \u03b4i\u22121 = \u03b4i . By changing the valence of the vertex sw\ni to three, we also\nremove it from the star of the winding vertex. So, either it becomes good and we\n\n36\n\n\fw\nFigure 29: The case when sw\nq is three-valent and xq is a boundary saddle\n\n\u275c\n\u275cq\n\u275c\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745r w\n\u2745r\nxq\n\u2745\n\u2745\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\u271f\nr\n\u271f\u271f\n\u271f\u271f\n\u271f\nr\n\u271f\n\u275c\u271f\n\u275c\n\nsw\n\nsw\nq\u22121\n\nsw\n\nsw\n\ncan proceed as in Case 4, or it is still bad and then there must be a good two- or\nthree-valent interior vertex or a univalent boundary vertex somewhere else.\nIn order to complete the proof of Propositions 6\u20138, we need only to consider the\ncase c(M ) = 0. If L is an arc-presentation of the unknot, then (2) and (3) imply\nc(L) = V2b = 2.\nIf L is a split or composite link, we may assume without loss of generality that\nL \u2229 S\u03c61 = {0, \u03c0}. Then the line x = \u03c0 will be splitting or factorizing, respectively,\nfor the rectangular diagram of L.\nA couple of remarks are in order.\nRemark 12. The assertions of Propositions 7 and 8 can be strengthened a little\nby skipping destabilization moves in the formulation. Indeed, it is trivial to show\nthat, for any sequence L0 7\u2192 L1 7\u2192 L2 7\u2192 . . . 7\u2192 LN of exchange and destabilization\nmoves, there exists a sequence L0 7\u2192 L\u20321 7\u2192 L\u20322 7\u2192 . . . 7\u2192 L\u2032N \u2032 \u22121 7\u2192 L\u2032N \u2032 = LN in\nwhich the first k moves are exchanges and the last N \u2032 \u2212 k ones destabilizations. If\nLN is split or composite, then L\u2032k is also split or composite, respectively.\nRemark 13. One can easily show that, for any two sequences\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nD0 7\u2192 D1 7\u2192 . . . 7\u2192 DN1\n\nand\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nD0 7\u2192 D1 7\u2192 . . . 7\u2192 DN2\n\nof cyclic permutation, exchange, and destabilization moves of rectangular diagrams,\nthere exists a sequence\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nD0 #D0 7\u2192 D1 7\u2192 D2 7\u2192 . . . 7\u2192 DN = DN1 #DN2\n\nof cyclic permutation, exchange, and destabilization moves. A similar statement is\ntrue for the distant union operation. Thus, we can obtain a complete decomposition\nof an arc-presentation by using exchange and destabilization moves.\n\n3\n\nApplications\n\n3.1 An algorithm for recognizing the unknot, recognizing split links, and link factorization\nPropositions 6\u20138 allow to construct a simple algorithm for recognizing the unknot,\ndecomposing a given link into the distant union of non-split links, and factorizing a\nnon-split link to prime links. The algorithm works as follows.\n\n37\n\n\fWe search for all arc-presentations obtained by finite sequences of exchange\nmoves from a given one. Since, for any n, the number of combinatorial classes\nof arc-presentations of complexity n is finite, the process will terminate in finitely\nmany steps. Let L1 , L2 , . . . , LN be the arc-presentations found. If some Li admits\na destabilization move Li 7\u2192 L\u2032 , we replace L by L\u2032 and proceed as before. In\nfinitely many steps, we get a list of arc-presentations none of which can be simplified\nanymore. Denote them again by L1 , . . . , LN and their rectangular diagrams by\nD1 , . . . , DN . For each i = 1, . . . , N we find a maximal decomposition\nDi = (Di1 # . . . #Dip ) \u2294 . . . \u2294 (Diq # . . . #Dir ) \u2294 Di,r+1 \u2294 . . . \u2294 Di,Ni ,\nwhere all diagrams Di1 , . . . , Dir are non-trivial. We choose i so as to have maximal\npossible value of Ni . Then all diagrams Di1 , . . . , Dir will represent non-trivial links,\nand all Di,r+1 , . . . , DiNi prime non-split links or trivial knots.\nRemark 14. It is natural to ask how fast the algorithm just described is. Unfortunately, the answer is not optimistic in the sense that the algorithm is too hard to\nbe implemented in practice: we cannot provide an estimation for the running time\nmuch better than n2n , where n is the complexity of the given diagram. However,\nwe think that the algorithm can be improved considerably. We describe the point\nvery briefly.\nWe say that an arc-presentation L is simplifiable if there exists a sequence of\nexchange moves L 7\u2192 L1 7\u2192 . . . 7\u2192 Lk such that a destabilization move can be\napplied to Lk . So, the problem is actually this: how to detect that a given arcpresentation is simplifiable and find the corresponding sequence of exchanges as fast\nas possible? Also, we need a fast method to decide whether a given non-simplifiable\narc-presentation can be transformed into a split or composite one by using exchange\nmoves. There is a hope that a solution much better than an exhaustive search might\nexist. So far, this problem has not been investigated.\n\n3.2 An upper bound on the crossing number needed for\nuntangling\nWe shall use the notation c\u00d7 (D) for the crossing number of a planar diagram D.\nWe shall also denote by carc (D) the complexity of the arc-presentation corresponding to a rectangular diagram D. We introduce two different notations, because a\nrectangular diagram can be viewed in both ways, as an arc-presentation and as an\nordinary planar diagram.\nTheorem 2. Let D0 be an ordinary planar diagram of either a trivial knot, a\nsplit link, or a composite link. Then there exists a sequence of Reidemeister moves\nD0 7\u2192 D1 7\u2192 . . . 7\u2192 DN such that the diagram DN is trivial, split, or composite,\nrespectively, and we have c\u00d7 (Di ) 6 2(c\u00d7 (D0 ) + 1)2 for all i.\nProof. It is shown in [7] that there is an algorithm for converting a planar diagram\nD0 to an arc-presentation that has no more than c\u00d7 (D0 ) + 2 arcs provided that\nD0 satisfies certain restrictions. By using the same method, one can show that\nthe estimation 2c\u00d7 (D0 ) + 2 works for any connected diagram D0 . Let D (1) be the\n\n38\n\n\fcorresponding rectangular diagram. Following the lines of the conversion procedure,\none sees that there is a sequence of Reidemeister moves D0 7\u2192 D1 7\u2192 . . . 7\u2192 Di1 =\nD (1) such that c\u00d7 (Di ) 6 c\u00d7 (D (1) ) for all i = 1, . . . , i1 .\nNotice that a cyclic permutation of horizontal (vertical) edges of a rectangular\ndiagram can be decomposed into one stabilization move, a few exchange moves,\nand one destabilization move (see Fig. 30). Therefore, we can find a sequence of\n\nFigure 30: Cyclic permutation via stabilization, exchanges, and destabilization\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n7\u2192\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n7\u2192\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n7\u2192 \u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n(de)stabilization and exchange moves D (1) 7\u2192 D (2) 7\u2192 . . . 7\u2192 D (m) such that the final\ndiagram D (m) is trivial, split, or composite, respectively, and, for all j = 1, . . . , m,\nwe have carc (D (j) ) 6 2c\u00d7 (D0 ) + 3.\nIt is easy to show that, for any rectangular diagram D, we have\nc\u00d7 (D) 6 (carc (D) \u2212 1)2 /2.\nIt remains to notice that, for any exchange or (de)stabilization move D (j) 7\u2192 D (j+1) ,\nthere exists a finite sequence of Reidemeister moves\nD (j) 7\u2192 Dij +1 7\u2192 Dij +2 7\u2192 . . . 7\u2192 Dij+1 = D (j+1)\nsuch that c\u00d7 (Dij +l ) 6 max(c\u00d7 (D (j) ), c\u00d7 (D (j+1) )).\n\n3.3\n\nResults of Birman and Menasco on closed braids\n\nThe results of [3] and [4] on closed braid representatives of links can be deduced from\nthe main result of this paper, which is not a surprise because we used a modification\nof a technique that was originally worked out by Birman and Menasco for studying\nclosed braids.\nFirst of all, we briefly recall what the elementary moves for braids are:\n1) conjugation\nb 7\u2192 cbc\u22121 ,\n\nb, c \u2208 Bn ;\n\n2) stabilization\nb 7\u2192 b\u03c3n\u00b11 \u2208 Bn+1 ,\n\nb \u2208 Bn \u2282 Bn+1 ;\n\n3) destabilization\nb\u03c3n\u00b11 7\u2192 b,\n\nb \u2208 Bn \u2282 Bn+1 ;\n\n4) exchange\nb1 \u03c3n\u00b11 b2 \u03c3n\u22131 7\u2192 b1 \u03c3n\u22131 b2 \u03c3n\u00b11 ,\n\n39\n\nb1 , b2 \u2208 Bn \u2282 Bn+1 .\n\n\fThe moves 1)\u20133) are Markov's moves, exchange moves were introduced by J. Birman\nand W. Menasco. In [3], [4] a more general transform is called an exchange move,\nso the one above is a particular case of that transform. However, one can easily\nshow that the more general, \"multistrand\", exchange move can be decomposed into\na finite number of \"elementary\" exchange moves and braid isotopies.\nAn exchange move can be decomposed into finite sequence of Markov's moves,\nbut not always within the class of braids with the same or smaller number of strands.\nThe main result of [3] and [4] is the following.\nTheorem 3 (Birman, Menasco). If b0 is a braid whose closure is a trivial knot,\nthen there exists a finite sequence b0 7\u2192 b1 7\u2192 . . . 7\u2192 bN of conjugations, destabilizations, and exchanges such that bN is a trivial braid on one strand.\nIf b0 is a braid whose closure is either a split link or a composite link, there exists\na finite sequence b0 7\u2192 b1 7\u2192 . . . 7\u2192 bN of conjugations and exchanges such that bN\nis a split braid or a composite braid, respectively.\nFor the definition of split and composite braids, see [3].\nProof. We give here a sketch only, inviting the reader to recover the details.\nThe construction of 1.4 applied to a split or a composite rectangular diagram D\ngives a braid bD which is conjugate to a split or composite braid, respectively.\nBy a straightforward check one establishes the following:\n\u2022 if D 7\u2192 D \u2032 is an exchange of vertical edges, then bD = bD\u2032 ;\n\u2022 if D 7\u2192 D \u2032 is a cyclic permutation of edges, then either bD 7\u2192 bD\u2032 is a conjugation or we have bD = bD\u2032 ;\n\u2022 if D 7\u2192 D \u2032 is an exchange of the upper two horizontal edges, then bD 7\u2192 bD\u2032 is\neither a conjugation or an exchange, depending on the orientation of the edges\nand their relative position (it is assumed that we enumerate the braid strands\nfrom the bottom to the top);\n\u2022 if D 7\u2192 D \u2032 is a destabilization move involving the upper two horizontal edges\nof D, then either bD 7\u2192 bD\u2032 is a destabilization move or we have bD = bD\u2032 ,\ndepending on the orientation of the edges.\nLet b be a braid whose closure is a trivial knot. According to Proposition 2 there\nexists a rectangular diagram D such that b = bD . From Proposition 6 we know that\nthere exists a sequence D 7\u2192 D1 7\u2192 . . . 7\u2192 DN of exchanges, cyclic permutations,\nand destabilizations which takes the diagram D to a trivial diagram DN .\nEach exchange move Di 7\u2192 Di+1 can be decomposed into some number of cyclic\npermutations of horizontal edges and an exchange move that involves the upper\ntwo edges. Similarly, each destabilization Di 7\u2192 Di+1 can be decomposed into some\nnumber of cyclic permutations and a destabilization involving the upper two horizontal edges. Therefore, the braid bDN , which is the unit of B1 , can be obtained from\nthe initial braid b by finitely many exchanges, conjugations, and destabilizations.\nFor split and composite braids, the proof is similar. One should use Propositions 7 and 8, respectively, and also Remark 12 (to show that destabilizations are\nnot needed in this case).\n\n40\n\n\fRemark 15. Notice that, as a by-product, we received a new proof of Markov's\ntheorem, which is now a corollary to Proposition 4.\n\n3.4\n\nTwo tests for knottedness\n\nHow one usually concludes that a given knot is truly knotted? The standard way\nto prove that a given knot is non-trivial is to compute some knot invariant like\nthe Alexander polynomial or the Jones polynomial. Such computations seem to be\nhard for large knots. The algorithms known up to now for computing polynomial\ninvariants take at least exponential time in the complexity of a link diagram.\nHowever, there is (at least) one well known exception from the above mentioned\nsituation: if an alternating planar diagram of a knot has no separating vertex, then\nit presents a non-trivial knot or a non-split link (see [15]). To check that a given\ndiagram is alternating and has no separating vertex is very easy.\nHere, we provide two sufficient conditions for knottedness in terms of arc-presentations (rectangular diagrams). Verification of the conditions requires not more\nthan quadratic time in the complexity of the diagram provided that the diagram is\nencoded in a reasonable way.\nFrom Propositions 6\u20138 one concludes the following\nCorollary 1. If no exchange and no destabilization move can be applied to a nontrivial arc-presentation L, then L is a non-trivial non-split prime link.\nProof. We need only to comment on why L is prime, i.e., non-composite. The point\nis that, if L is composite as a link, then Proposition 8 implies that L is composite\nas an arc-presentation. This contradicts the assumption, since a composite arcpresentation always admits exchange moves.\nThe assumption of Corollary 1 means that L does not have \"trivial\" arcs, i.e.,\narcs connecting two neighbouring vertices, and any two neighbouring arcs (vertices)\nof L interleave. In terms of the corresponding rectangular diagram, this means that\nany two neighbouring vertical (horizontal) edges interleave provided that we regard\nthe rightmost and leftmost (the top and the bottom) edges also as neighbouring.\nDiagrams of this kind will be said to be rigid.\nThere are numerous examples of rigid diagrams. Any torus knot or link can be\npresented by a rigid diagram. A rigid diagram of the Whitehead link is displayed\non the left of Fig. 31. Notice that, in the contrast to the case of alternating planar\ndiagrams, rigid and non-rigid rectangular diagrams of the same complexity can\npresent equivalent prime links. For example, the diagram of the Whitehead link on\nthe right of Fig. 31 is not rigid, though it has the same complexity as the one on\nthe left.\nIn Fig. 32 we show a rigid diagram of a two-component link with zero multivariable Alexander polynomial and zero linking number. (The latter two invariants\nare often used to establish non-splitness. The example was constructed in response\nto a question by Jozef Przytycki, who asked the author whether rigid diagrams\nalways have non-zero Alexander polynomial. So, the answer is 'no'. Recall that\n\n41\n\n\fFigure 31: Two rectangular diagrams of the Whitehead link\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\nA rigid diagram\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\nA non-rigid diagram\n\nFigure 32: A rigid diagram of a link with zero Alexander polynomial\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\u275c\n\nthe non-triviality of alternating links was proved in [15] by showing that they have\nnon-trivial Jones polynomial.)\nThe second test for knottedness uses an analogue of the writhe. Let us denote\nby f\u03b5+ and f\u03b5\u2212 the self-homeomorphisms of S 3 defined by\nf\u03b5\u00b1 (\u03c6, \u03c4, \u03b8) = (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03b5, \u03c4, \u03b8 \u00b1 \u03b5).\nLet L be an arc-presentation of an oriented link. Pick an \u03b5 > 0 such that \u03b5 is less\nthan the \u03c6-distance between any two vertices of L and \u03b8-distance between any two\narcs of L. Then the link f\u03b5\u00b1 (L) will be disjoint from L.\nWe define the upper (respectively, the lower ) writhe of L to be the linking\nnumber of L with f\u03b5+ (L) (respectively, f\u03b5\u2212 (L)). We denote the upper and lower\nwrithes of L by w+ (L) and w\u2212 (L), respectively. By the writhe of L we shall mean\nthe couple (w\u2212 (L), w+ (L)).\nThe numbers w\u00b1 (L) can be easily computed from the knowledge of a rectangular\ndiagram D of L. We divide the set of crossings and the set of turns of the diagram\nD into two types, which we call positive and negative, according to Figures 33 and\n34.\nWe define the writhe w(D) of a rectangular link diagram D in the standard way:\nw(D) is the number of positive crossings less the number of negative crossings in\nD. Denote by n+ (D) and n\u2212 (D), respectively, the number of positive and negative\nturns in D. The following three facts are established by a straightforward check.\n\n42\n\n\fFigure 33: Positive and negative crossings\n\u271b\n\n\u273b\n\n\u273b\n\u2732\n\n\u2732\n\n\u271b\n\n\u2744\n\n\u2744\n\npositive crossings\n\nnegative crossings\n\nFigure 34: Positive and negative turns\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\npositive turns\n\n\u275c\n\nnegative turns\n\nProposition 10. Let L be an arc-presentation of an oriented link, D the corresponding rectangular diagram. Then we have:\nw+ (L) = w(D) +\n\nn+ (D)\n,\n2\n\nw\u2212 (L) = w(D) \u2212\n\nn\u2212 (D)\n,\n2\n\n(13)\n\nwhich implies, in particular, the following:\nw+ (L) \u2212 w\u2212 (L) = c(L).\n\n(14)\n\nProposition 11. The writhe of an arc-presentation does not change under exchange\nmoves.\nEquivalently, the right-hand side of any of the formulae (13) is not changed under\ncyclic permutation of vertical or horizontal edges and interchange of non-interleaved\nneighbouring vertical or horizontal edges of D.\nProposition 12. Let L be an arc-presentation of an oriented link, L 7\u2192 L\u2032 a stabilization move. Then we have either\nw+ (L\u2032 ) = w+ (L) + 1,\n\nw\u2212 (L\u2032 ) = w\u2212 (L\u2032 )\n\nw\u2212 (L\u2032 ) = w\u2212 (L) \u2212 1,\n\nw+ (L\u2032 ) = w+ (L).\n\nor\nFor the trivial arc-presentation L of the unknot, we have w+ (L) = 1, w\u2212 (L) =\n\u22121. For the distant union L1 \u2294 L2 of two arc-presentations, we have w\u00b1 (L1 \u2294 L2 ) =\nw\u00b1 (L1 ) + w\u00b1 (L2 ). In conjunction with Propositions 6, 7, 11, and 12, this implies\nthe following.\nCorollary 2. If L is an arc-presentation of the trivial link of k components, then\nwe have\nw\u2212 (L) 6 \u2212k, k 6 w+ (L).\n(15)\n\n43\n\n\fIt happens very often that w\u2212 (L) > 0 or w+ (L) 6 0, which immediately implies\nthat link L is non-trivial. For example, the torus link of type (p, q) has an arcpresentation Lp,q whose arcs are\n\u03b3\u2212 2\u03c0k , 2\u03c0k , 2\u03c0(k+p) ,\np+q p+q\n\np+q\n\nwhere k = 1, . . . , p + q. A simple calculation gives:\nw\u2212 (Lp,q ) = pq \u2212 p \u2212 q,\n\nw+ (Lp,q ) = pq.\n\nIf both p and q are large, then the interval (w\u2212 , w+ ) stays far away from 0, and this\nremains true after a certain number of modifications of the diagram of Lp,q .\n\nAcknowledgement\nI am thankful to A.
