The characteristic\npath length l is defined to be the average of the shortest\npath lengths between any two nodes: In many complex\nnetworks, the behavior l \u223c logN with the network size\nN is observed, while regular lattices display l \u223c O(N ).\nWhen a dynamical system of many elements is put on a\nsmall-world network, information exchange between two\nelements involves only relatively short distance of the order of log N . It has been observed in recent studies that\nthe presence of shortcuts induces long-range order below the critical temperature [3, 4]. Furthermore, nature\nof the phase transition has been unambiguously demonstrated to belong to the mean-field universality class. In\nthose studies of the spin models on small-world networks,\nspin interactions have been assumed to be uniform, which\nis rather unrealistic in view of usual systems in nature. It\nis thus desirable to examine the general case of distancedependent interactions, which has not been addressed.\nIn this paper we study the Ising model on a smallworld network, constructed from a one-dimensional lattice, with the interaction J decaying algebraically with\ndistance r, i.e., J(r) \u221d r\u2212\u03b1 . In such a case of the algebraically decreasing interaction, the critical behavior\nis expected to change with the exponent \u03b1: The limit\n\u03b1 \u2192 0 corresponds to the uniform interaction, which\nyields a mean-field transition at the finite critical temperature [3]. In the opposite limit of \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e, the spins interact with only their nearest neighbors, resulting in the\nabsence of long-range order at finite temperatures. This\nconsideration suggests the existence of nontrivial critical value \u03b1c beyond which the finite-temperature phase\ntransition disappears.\nHere we construct a small-world network in the following way: First a one-dimensional lattice of N nodes is\nconstructed with each node connected to its 2k nearest\n\nneighbors, where k is the local interaction range. Then\neach local edge is visited once and a random long-range\nconnection (shortcut) is added with the probability P\nwithout removing local edges. Note the difference from\nthe original Watts and Strogatz (WS) construction [2],\nwhere local edges are removed and reconnected to a randomly chosen node.\nThe Hamiltonian for an Ising model on such a smallworld network is given by\nH=\u2212\n\n1X\nJij \u03c3i \u03c3j ,\n2\n\n(1)\n\ni6=j\n\nwhere \u03c3i (= \u00b11) is the Ising spin on node i of the network.\nThe distance-dependent interaction Jij reads\n\u001a \u2212\u03b1\nJrij if i and j are connected\nJij = Jji =\n(2)\n0\notherwise,\nwhere rij is the geometrical distance (rather than the\nshortest path length) between the two nodes i and j on\nthe underlying one-dimensional lattice.\nFrom the comparison of the two limits \u03b1 \u2192 0 and\n\u03b1 \u2192 \u221e, a total of three distinct regimes may be expected [5, 6]: (i) mean-field-type critical behavior for \u03b1 <\n\u03b11 ; (ii) continuously varying critical exponents for \u03b11 <\n\u03b1 < \u03b12 ; (iii) the short-range interaction regime with\nno phase transition for \u03b1 > \u03b12 . In Ref. 5, two boundary values \u03b11 and \u03b12 were obtained via renormalizationgroup calculations for the O(n) model on a d-dimensional\nglobally-coupled system. In particular, it is well known\nthat \u03b11 = 3/2 and \u03b12 = 2 for the one-dimensional\nglobally-coupled Ising model. Note here that the total\nnumber of connections in this one-dimensional globallycoupled system, given by N (N \u2212 1)/2 with N being the\nnumber of spins, is far larger than that in a small-world\nnetwork, which is of the order of N . Accordingly, smaller\nboundary values of \u03b1 are anticipated for the small-world\nnetwork.\n\n\f2\n0.7\n\n0.5\n\n4\n\n[hm i]\n3[hm2 i]2\n\n(3)\n\n1 X\n[h\u03c3i \u03c3j i]\nN ij\n\n(4)\n\nUN = 1 \u2212\n\n\u03c7=\n\nN=51200\n25600\n12800\n6400\n3200\n1600\n800\n400\n200\n100\n\n0.6\n\nUN\n\nWe have performed extensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with the heat bath algorithm at various values\nof P and \u03b1.

When P = 0, the network reduces to a simple\none-dimensional lattice, displaying no long-range order\nat any finite temperature. For P 6= 0, on the other hand,\nthe presence of long-range shortcuts deprives the system\nof the locally connected one-dimensional character. In\nparticular, when the interaction is uniform (\u03b1 = 0), the\nsystem at P 6= 0 undergoes a finite-temperature transition of the mean-field nature [3].\nTo find \u03b11 and \u03b12 , beyond which mean-field behavior and long-range order do not emerge, respectively, we\nhave examined the behavior of the system with \u03b1 varied\nat fixed P . At any nonzero value of \u03b1, the algebraically\ndecaying interaction is cut off by the finite network size\nand consequently, the ground-state energy in general decreases as N grows. For given values of k, P , and \u03b1,\nwe thus normalize the coupling strength J so that the\nsystem has the size-independent ground-state energy per\nspin. As \u03b1 is reduced, the interaction does not yet decay\nsubstantially at the boundary; this makes it inevitable\nto study systems of very large sizes for obtaining correct\nscaling behavior.\nFigure 1 presents the MC results for the network with\nP = 0.5 and \u03b1 = 0.1. Binder's cumulant UN , the susceptibility \u03c7, and the specific heat CV as functions of\nthe temperature are shown in (a), (b), and (c), respectively. The absence of a unique crossing point of Binder's\ncumulant shown in Fig. 1(a) and the shift of the susceptibility peak in Fig. 1(b) as well as the peak position of\nthe specific heat in Fig. 1(c) unanimously suggest the\nabsence of a phase transition at finite temperatures. At\nthe temperatures where \u03c7 and Cv display peaks, fluctuations are large and the correlation volume becomes\ncomparable with the system size. This gives some information about the temperature at which critical phenomena are observed.

The larger the value of \u03b1 is, the faster the peak\ntemperature decreases.\n\n1.55\n\n1.6\n\n1.65\nT\n\n0.7\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\n(b)\n\n0.3\n\nheat exhibits similar behavior in Fig. 1(c), although the\nsystem size at which the peak position starts to shift toward lower temperatures does not coincide with that for\nthe susceptibility.\nTo clarify the drift of the peak temperature, we show in\nFig. 2 the peak temperatures Tp of the susceptibility versus the inverse system size 1/N , together with the fitted\nlines described by the logarithmic form: Tp = a\u2212b log N .\nThe peak position thus approaches zero logarithmically\nas the system size grows. Here the values of the fitting\nparameters are given by a = 1.62 and b = 0.016 for\n\u03b1 = 0.1; a = 1.67 and b = 0.042 for \u03b1 = 0.2; a = 1.69\nand b = 0.064 for \u03b1 = 0.3. This indicates that the peak\ntemperature decreases faster as the exponent \u03b1 is raised.\nAs mentioned above, simulations here have been performed in the crossover region, giving rise to logarithmic\nbehavior of the peak position with the system size. When\nthe exponent \u03b1 is small, the interaction reduces very\nslowly with the distance. Nevertheless it gets weakened\nsubstantially in a system of very large size. For example,\nwhen \u03b1 = 0.1, the interaction between the two connected\nnodes of the maximum distance (i.e., half the system size)\nis only about 40% of the nearest-neighbor interaction in\nthe system of size N = 51200. Consequently, long-range\nconnections do not contribute significantly to the system to be ordered in the thermodynamic limit, and the\nabsence of a finite-temperature transition is not very surprising. We have also investigated the case of \u03b1 = 0.05,\nwhich requires simulations of even larger system size, to\nobtain similar results. These observations strongly suggest that the system does not undergo a phase transition\nat a finite temperature for any nonzero value of \u03b1, thus\nleading to \u03b11 = \u03b12 = 0. Figure 3 shows that the conclusion \u03b11 = \u03b12 = 0 is apparently valid even for P = 1.0,\nwhich corresponds to the network with the largest number of long-range connections.

(a) The peak temperature\nof the susceptibility decreases as the system size grows for\nN & 1600. (b) A unique crossing point is not observed in\nBinder's cumulant, implying the absence of a phase transition\nat a finite temperature.\n\nbelief that small-world networks are similar to globallycoupled networks in the transition nature [3, 4] is valid\nonly for the (ideal) uniform interaction. In the more realistic case of the interaction decaying with distance, the\ntwo systems display striking difference.\nIn summary, we have studied the Ising model on\nsmall-world networks with the interaction decaying algebraically with exponent \u03b1. For this, we have performed\nextensive Monte Carlo simulations on the networks with\nthe probability for adding shortcuts given by P = 0.5\nand 1. In both cases, absence of a finite-temperature\ntransition has been observed at any nonzero value of \u03b1.\nIn particular, the absence in the latter, which is the extreme case of the small-world network with the largest\nnumber of long-range shortcuts, implies the validity for\nany values of P (< 1). This conclusion should also hold\nfor the original WS network, where shortcuts are introduced by rewiring of the local edges, since it has less\ninteractions than the network investigated in the present\nwork.\n\n\f4\nAcknowledgments\n\nB.J.K. was supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation through Grant No. R14-2002-062-\n\n[1] For reviews, see, e.g., Science 284, 79-109 (1999); M.E.J.\nNewman, J.
