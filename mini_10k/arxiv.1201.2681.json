In fact, much of the pioneering\nwork on the intrinsically magnetized family of current-driven\ninstabilities (CDI) was conducted by the plasma physics\ncommunity with the goal of understanding confined plasma\ncolumns in the context of Tokamak-type fusion experiments.\nNevertheless, there are many obvious astrophysical circumstances where CDI have the potential to play a significant role.\nJets emerging from accretion onto black holes, for example, are very likely to be magnetically launched (e.g., Lovelace\n1976, Blandford 1976, Blandford & Payne 1982) and subsec 0000 RAS\n\nquently magnetically dominated near their points of origin.\nSuch flows will generally be subject to CDI, but the ramifications of instability in this context remain unclear, particularly when the jet is bounded by a strong shear layer. Even\nif a shear layer confines lateral jet expansion and disruption caused by CDI, one could still imagine CDI-driven dissipation resulting in variability signatures, such as the very\nrapid TeV variability recently observed in blazars Mrk 501 and\nPKS 2155-304 (Aharonian et al. 2007; Albert et al. 2007). At\ngreater distances from their origin, jets from active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) are also inferred observationally to transition to\na kinetic-energy dominated flow (Sikora et al. 2005), a process which itself may very well involve CDI-driven dissipation.\nEven in such a weakly magnetized regime, however, CDI have\nthe potential to grow and subsequently to disrupt otherwise\nlaminar flows.\nThis is not an issue exclusively relevant to ultra-\n\n\f2\n\nO'Neill et al.\n\nrelativistic jets. In the context of filled supernova remnants\n(i.e., plerions), notably including the Crab Nebula, CDI have\nbeen identified as a possible means of breaking axisymmetry in the outflowing pulsar-driven wind (Begelman 1998). If\npresent, this process could obviate commonly made geometric assumptions that constrain the magnetization of the flow\nat the wind shock to be significantly less than unity (e.g., Rees\n& Gunn 1974). Known as the \"\u03c3 problem,\" this inference has\nlong been at odds with the fact that the wind is likely to be\nmagnetically dominated near the pulsar (Goldreich & Julian\n1970) while simultaneously unlikely to convert enough of its\nmagnetic energy before reaching the shock (e.g., Begelman\n& Li 1994), but CDI-driven asymmetry may provide a solution to this seeming paradox. Furthermore, it is possible that\ndissipation events facilitated by instabilities such as the CDI\ncould produce the recently observed, rapid, gamma-ray flares\nobserved in the Crab Nebula by AGILE (Tavani et al. 2011)\nand Fermi (Abdo et al. 2011).\nThere has been much discussion over the years in both\nthe plasma physics and astrophysics communities on the linear development of the CDI under various physical conditions, with much of the pioneering work emerging in the\nlatter half of the last century. Lundquist (1951), for example, identified a criterion describing the ratio of poloidal\nto toroidal field that would cause a magnetized cylinder to\nbecome unstable. Kruskal & Schwarzschild (1954) further\ndemonstrated analytically that a plasma column threaded by\na purely toroidal field (known in fusion literature as a \"Zpinch\") is characteristically unstable. This work was later generalized by Tayler (1957) to multiple mode numbers. Additionally, Kadomtsev (1966) identified a criterion for which\nthe axisymmetric m=0 mode of CDI (commonly referred to as\nthe \"sausage instability\") is stable. Useful overviews of the basic physics of CDI, including distinctions between the internal\n(fixed-boundary) and external (free-boundary) kink modes\nand discussions of cylindrical column stability, have appeared\nin a number of textbooks, including Bateman (1978) and\nGoedbloed & Poedts (2004), and a review article by Boozer\n(2004).\nIn the context of astrophysics, stability analyses have\nbeen conducted in the non-relativistic limit by a large number of groups (Cohn 1983; Pietrini & Torricelli-Ciamponi\n1989; Corbelli & Torricelli-Ciamponi 1990; Appl & Camenzind 1992; Appl 1996; Appl et al. 2000; Kersal\u00e9 et al. 2000;\nBonanno & Urpin 2011) under various sets of assumptions.\nResearch investigating stability in the relativistic regime has\nbeen undertaken primarily in the force-free limit (Istomin &\nPariev 1994, 1996; Lyubarskii 1999; Tomimatsu et al. 2001;\nNarayan et al. 2009), with the exception of Begelman (1998),\nwhich did not make the force-free assumption. This latter\nwork will form the primary point of comparison between analytic theory and those of our simulations that include a pressure gradient that initially balances the magnetic forces.\nMagnetohydrodynamic simulations of CDI have been\nconducted in a number of different contexts. In the nonrelativistic regime, Lery et al. (2000), Baty & Keppens (2002),\nNakamura & Meier (2004), Li et al. (2006), Nakamura et al.\n(2007), Nakamura et al. (2008), Moll et al. (2008), and\nIvanovski & Bonanno (2009) have explored both local and\nglobal models of CDI evolution. Relativistic numerical investigations of CDI, however, have thus far been conducted by a\nrelatively small number of groups. In a recent series of papers,\n\nMizuno et al. (2009) and Mizuno et al. (2011) have run and\nanalyzed local simulations of CDI both generally and in the\nspecific context of pulsar wind nebulae. These models, simulated in a reference frame that is co-moving with the bulk\njet flow, were designed to explore the evolution of CDI under the most idealized circumstances. They further extended\nthis work to local models bounded by a shear layer to explore interactions between CDI and the KHI (Mizuno et al.\n2011), providing an extension into the relativistic limit of an\nearlier investigation by Baty & Keppens (2002). Additionally,\nMcKinney & Blandford (2009) have conducted a set of global\ngeneral relativistic simulations, finding that their jets develop\nonly limited substructure resulting from the action of CDI, although Mignone et al. (2010) identify \"jet wiggling\" in their\nglobal special relativistic jets that they do attribute to CDI.\nOur goal in this work is to construct a large number\nof idealized jet configurations to determine various circumstances under which CDI develop and to examine the resulting flow morphologies and energetics. Adopting a similar approach to that of Mizuno et al. (2009), we will exclusively\nconsider local models in which the observer is co-moving\nwith the bulk flow, far removed from any jet boundaries. Unlike previous work, however, we will explore several different arrangements of the initial forces, considering systems in\nwhich the magnetic fields are force-free and those in which\nthe J \u00d7 B force is balanced by pressure gradients and/or rotation. The results of these simulations will be compared both\nto analytic estimates of CDI linear growth and to the results\nof previously conducted numerical simulations. Additionally,\nwe will determine whether special relativity plays an important role in the evolution of these systems even in a reference\nframe for which the bulk velocity has been transformed away.\nSection 2 outlines our numerical methods and the initial conditions of our various models of magnetized plasma columns.\nSection 3 describes the results of our simulations, in terms\nof the simulated column morphologies, energetics, and how\nthese quantities depend on various physical and numerical\ninputs. Finally, we discuss the implications of our models and\npresent our conclusions in Section 4.\n\n2\n\nNUMERICAL DETAILS\n\nThe calculations presented in this work were conducted using\nAthena, a second-order accurate Godunov flux-conservative\ncode for solving the equations of magnetohydrodynamics\n(MHD)1 . The basic algorithms implemented in Athena are\ndescribed by Gardiner & Stone (2005, 2008) with further details (implementation and multi-dimensional tests) given in\nStone et al. (2008). Specifically, we utilize the dimensionally\nunsplit MUSCL-Hancock integrator (\"Van-Leer\") described by\nStone & Gardiner (2009) combined with the constrained\ntransport (CT) method of Gardiner & Stone (2005, 2008) to\nmaintain the divergence-less nature of the magnetic field in\nmulti-dimensions, extended to relativistic MHD (RMHD) as\ndescribed by Beckwith & Stone (2011).\nThe RMHD module within the Athena code implements\na variety of Riemann solvers and spatial reconstruction methods (as described in Beckwith & Stone 2011). Beckwith &\n1\n\nThe Athena code and a repository of test problems are maintained\nonline at https://trac.princeton.edu/Athena/.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fCDI Morphology and Energetics\nStone (2011) demonstrate that the choice of Riemann solver\ncan play an important role in determining the spectral accuracy of a numerical scheme. Even if a given scheme is stable\nand consistent, so that solutions converge to a weak solution\nof the conservation law, the solution itself may not be unique.\nThat is, algorithms with different spectral performance may\nconverge to different weak solutions of the conservation law.\nAs a result, it is important to assess the impact of different\nalgorithmic choices (such as Riemann solver and spatial reconstruction method) on the outcome of simulations of CDI.\nThe impact of these choices, along with that of numerical resolution, on the development of CDI is examined in detail \u00a72.2.\n\n2.1\n\nInitial Conditions\n\nIn this work, we study the development of CDI in a set of idealized systems in order that we may understand the physics\nbehind the phenomena that develop. To do so, we conduct\nthree basic categories of simulation for which initial force balance is achieved in three different ways. In the Newtonian\napproximation and in the absence of an external force, hydromagnetic force balance of an ideal MHD fluid can be expressed as\n0 = \u2212(v * \u2207)v \u2212\n\n\u2207p\n1\n+ (J \u00d7 B),\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere v is the velocity field, p is the gas pressure, \u03c1 is the\ndensity, B is the magnetic field, and J = \u2207 \u00d7 B is the current\ndensity. In constructing this force balance equation, we have\ntaken units where G = M = c = 4\u03c0 = 1. If we further assume\nthat the velocity field is restricted to a rotational field of the\nform v = v\u03c6 (r)\u03c6\u0302 and consider only radial force balance, this\nexpression simplifies to\nv\u03c62\n(\u2207p)r\n1\n0=\n\u2212\n+ (J \u00d7 B)r ,\nr\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the first term is the (exclusively non-negative) centrifugal acceleration, the second is the pressure gradient, and the\nthird reflects magnetic pressure and/or tension. In our first\ncategory of simulation, which we label force-free (FF), each\nof these terms is independently set to zero, meaning that the\nsystem initially features uniform pressure, no rotation, and a\nnon-zero magnetic field. In the second type (PB) of simulation, the columns are initialized such that the pressure gradient and magnetic forces balance one another in the absence\nof rotation. In the third type (RPB), initial force balance is\nachieved through a combination of non-zero rotational, pressure, and magnetic forces. Table 1 provides a listing of all\nproduction-level simulations, and we will now explain the different types of initial conditions employed in each.

Typically, Bz = 0 for sinusoidal fields, corresponding to a magnetic pitch angle P \u2261 rBz /B\u03c6 = 0. The sole exceptions are\nthe PB-bz1 and PB-bz0.2 models, where a poloidal field is\npresent such that Bz (r) \u221d B\u03c6 (r), with the constants of proportionality provided for each model in Table 1. What we refer to as the Komissarov-type field (e.g., Komissarov 1999) is\na purely toroidal field in which\n(\nB0 (r/rc )\nr \u2264 rc\nB\u03c6 (r) =\n.\n(4)\n2\nB0 (rc /r)\nr > rc\nNote that our field model drops off more quickly outside of\nrc than that of Komissarov (1999) in order that the field will\nbe greatly reduced in magnitude as it approaches the computational grid boundaries. Additionally, we point out that the\nKomissarov-type configuration possesses a formally discontinuous magnetic field derivative at r = rc , a feature that we\navoid in our other field models (for a discussion of surface\ncurrents in initial conditions, see Gourgouliatos et al. 2011).\nFinally, the force-free case is similar to that used in, e.g., Appl\net al. (2000) and Mizuno et al. (2009), featuring a combina-\n\n\f4\n\nO'Neill et al.\ndesigned to excite the fastest-growing CDI modes:\n\ntion of toroidal and poloidal components:\nB\u03c6 (r) = B0\n\nrrc\n;\n(r2 + rc2 )\n\nBz (r) = \u2212B0\n\nrc2\n(r2 + rc2 )\n\n(5)\n\nThis field configuration corresponds to a constant magnetic\npitch of P = \u2212rc . In the FF models, an envelope function is\nalso applied in the outer 10% of the computational box to ensure that the magnetic field smoothly asymptotes to zero before intersecting the grid boundaries in directions perpendicular to the column axis. It is worth explicitly noting here that,\ndespite the fact that we provide these expressions in cylindrical coordinates for simplicity, the simulations themselves are\nconducted on a Cartesian grid.\nIn all cases, the columns are initialized with a spatially\nuniform density profile. The initial pressure profiles for the\nFF models are also spatially uniform, chosen such that the\nsound speed is \u223c 0.14c (except in the case of model FF-hot, in\nwhich the sound speed is \u223c 0.57c). The PB and RPB models,\nhowever, feature pressure profiles that vary radially. Specifically, the pressure in these two types of simulation is derived\nfrom the condition of initial force balance (Eq. 2), given assumed magnetic field and velocity profiles. Despite the fact\nthat many of the simulations themselves incorporate special\nrelativistic physics, Equation 2 is sufficiently accurate for initial force balance, which we tested by running the various initial configurations without applying a perturbation to make\ncertain that the equilibrium did not evolve significantly. Additionally, the pressure is scaled so that the minimum ratio\nof gas-to-magnetic pressure (\u03b2 \u2261 2p/B 2 ) achieves the value\nspecified in Table 1. All models except PB-\u03b23 and PB-\u03b230 feature \u03b2min < 1, reflecting the fact that portions of the computational grid are magnetically dominated. Additionally, the\nmaximum Alfv\u00e9n speeds for the fiducial models range from\nvA \u223c 0.1 (PB) to vA \u223c 0.3 (FF), the latter of which begins to\nenter into the relativistically strong field regime.\nFinally, the velocity profiles that we employ consist of\na combination of large-scale rotational flows (v\u03c6 ) and small\napplied perturbations (\u03b4vr , \u03b4v\u03c6 ). In all but the RBP models,\nthere is no large-scale rotation, so v\u03c6 = 0. In the RBP models,\nthe rotation profile is of the form\nv\u03c6 (r) = 0.5v0 (1 \u2212 cos[2\u03c0r/rv ]),\n\n(6)\n\nwhich is identical in form to the sinusoidal magnetic field profiles. This profile is motivated primarily by desiring rotation\nthat is both slowly increasing from zero near the center of the\ncolumn (so that it is numerically resolved) and zero also near\ncomputational grid boundaries perpendicular to the column\naxis. In the fiducial model RPB, v0 = 0.2c and rv = rc , so that\nthe magnetic field and rotation field are spatially co-located.\nIn model RPB-slow, the velocity is reduced such that v0 = 0.1c\n(for rv = rc ). Finally, in model RPB-xrot, the rotation profile\nis extended radially such that rv = 1.5rc (with v0 = 0.2c), so\nthat there is some rotation exterior to the magnetized region\nof the column. We should note that the RPB models are run\nexclusively using Newtonian physics. This is primarily for ease\nof establishing the initial force balance, although we intend to\nexplore the potential effects of special relativistic large-scale\nrotation and alternative rotation profiles (see, e.g. Moll et al.\n2008) in future work.\nThe perturbation applied is an |m| = 1 type perturbation\n\n\u03b4vr (r, \u03c6, z) = \u03b4v0 exp(\u2212r/4)[sin(\u03b7) cos(\u03c6) + cos(\u03b7) sin(\u03c6)]\n\u03b4v\u03c6 (r, \u03c6, z) = \u03b4v0 exp(\u2212r/4)[cos(\u03b7) cos(\u03c6) \u2212 sin(\u03b7) sin(\u03c6)],\n(7)\nwhere \u03b7 \u2261 2\u03c0z/zsize with zsize representing the size of the\ndomain in the direction parallel to the column axis. The value\nof \u03b4v0 is chosen such that the perturbation magnitude is of\norder 1% of the initial maximum Alfv\u00e9n speed vA in all but\nmodels FF-v6 and FF-v25 (see Table 1).\nAll of our models are simulated on Cartesian meshes\nof uniform cubic zone size at all locations on the grid. The\ncomputational domain size for the FF models is xsize /rc =\nysize /rc = 2zsize /rc = 32, where the column axis is initially oriented along the z direction. In the PB/RPB models,\nhowever, we increase the resolution to ensure that the pressure/rotation profiles are adequately resolved. This has the effect of reducing the domain size for a fixed number of zones,\nso that for the PB/RPB models the computational grid spans\nxsize /rc = ysize /rc = 2zsize /rc = 6.4. These domains are\nspanned by 256\u00d7256\u00d7128 zones in all of the production-scale\nmodels listed in Table 1, and we discuss tests of this resolution\nin \u00a72.2. In all models, standard Athena outflow boundaries\nare employed in the x and y directions while periodic boundaries are employed in z. In practice, the simulations are halted\nbefore there are substantial interactions with grid boundaries\northogonal to the column axis.\nTimes in the remainder of this work will be given in units\nof a representative Alfv\u00e9n crossing time \u03c4A , which we define\nas \u03c4A \u2261 rc /vA , where vA is the maximum initial Alfv\u00e9n speed\non the grid and rc is the initial column radius. While the local\nAlfv\u00e9n speed will obviously be a function of both position and\ntime, we emphasize that our definition of \u03c4A is only directly\nindicative of the minimum Alfv\u00e9n crossing time at t=0.\n2.2\n\nSpectral Accuracy & Numerical Convergence\n\nAs described in Beckwith & Stone (2011) and outlined above,\nchoices regarding the Riemann solver and the order of accuracy of spatial reconstruction (along with numerical resolution) can have important consequences for the interpretation of non-linear MHD phenomena observed in numerical\nsimulations. In the case of CDI in relativistic jets, the majority of prior simulations (e.g. Mizuno et al. 2009; McKinney\n& Blandford 2009) have been conducted using approximate\nHLLE-like solvers, where the structure of the Riemann fan is\ndiffused (Harten 1983). For these solvers, discontinuities that\nare exact solutions of the Riemann problem will evolve via\nnumerical diffusion, even when the flow is at rest (Mignone\net al. 2009). This diffusion plays an important role in determining the overall spectral accuracy of the numerical scheme\n(Mignone et al. 2009; Beckwith & Stone 2011). This numerical diffusivity can be reduced (and the spectral accuracy of\nthe scheme improved) by including the physics of contact and\nAlfv\u00e9n waves in the solution of the Riemann problem, e.g.\nas in the five-wave approximate Riemann solver (which we\nterm 'HLLD') initially described by Miyoshi & Kusano (2005)\nin the Newtonian regime and later extended to special relativity by Mignone et al. (2009). If the physics of the problem under consideration depends on the propagation of either of these wave families (e.g. the contact wave in the case\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fCDI Morphology and Energetics\n\n5\n\nFigure 1. A comparison of magnetic field isosurfaces between the\nHLLD and HLLE solvers for otherwise identical CDI simulations at\nt = 10 \u03c4A . The resolution used in these models is a factor of two\nlower than any of our production runs to emphasize how different\nRiemann solvers can produce strongly divergent outcomes.\n\nof counter-propagating shear flows, or Alfv\u00e9n waves in the\ncase of the magnetorotational instability), then use of Riemann solvers where these waves are diffused is likely to result in incomplete physical interpretations of simulation outcomes, even though the solution itself is mathematically correct. The growth of CDI is driven by the propagation of (modified) Alfv\u00e9n waves, so CDI-driven outcomes are likely affected\nby choices regarding the Riemann solver. This point is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows a side-by-side comparison of\nlow-resolution (128\u00d7128\u00d764 zones) test versions of model PB\nas conducted with the HLLD and HLLE solvers using Athena\ncomputed using second-order spatial reconstruction (see below). Clearly, the CDI-driven flow morphology at this resolution is dramatically affected by the choice of solver, particularly in regions of high magnetization that are conspicuously\nabsent for the model computed with the HLLE solver, a result\nconsistent with those of Beckwith & Stone (2011).\nTo illustrate that this is not a problem exclusively confined to low resolutions, we also present a comparison of energy evolution for the full-resolution PB models described in\nSection 2.1 and listed in Table 1. While we will defer an extensive discussion of CDI energetics to Section 3, it will suffice here to note that instability manifests itself as an initially\nexponential growth of kinetic energy (the so-called \"linear\"\ngrowth phase) that occurs at the expense of magnetic energy\nuntil the instability achieves a non-linear saturated state. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate sample dependences of the kinetic energy evolution on solver. In Figure 2, we see that solutions\ncomputed with the HLLD and HLLE solvers (again using 2ndorder spatial reconstruction) exhibit nearly identical growth\nrates during the linear phase of CDI development in model\nPB. Near the peak of the linear CDI development, however,\nthe two solutions begin to diverge slightly until the end of the\nsimulations, at which point the final kinetic energy for case\ncomputed with the HLLD solver is approximately 1.5 times\nthat of the HLLE case. In the FF models, the difference between solutions computed with the two solvers is significantly\nsmaller, only \u223c 17% over a much larger number of crossing\ntimes. Again, these differences are entirely attributable to the\nchoice of Riemann solver for configurations that were otherwise identical. To summarize, improving the spectral accuracy\nof the Riemann solver leads to dramatic changes in flow morphology and energetics; in particular the efficiency at which\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nFigure 2. Kinetic energy evolution for various solvers and reconstruction orders for the fiducial PB model. Each model is independently\nnormalized so that the total initial energy (TE+BE+KE) is unity. The\ncombination of the HLLE solver and 3rd-order (3p) reconstruction\nleads to a final kinetic energy that is approximately half that of the\nHLLD solver with 2nd-order (2p) reconstruction. This is a clear illustration that algorithmic differences can produce divergent behaviors\nthat, in most cases, have stronger effects than even the variation of\nphysical model parameters.\n\nFigure 3. Kinetic energy evolution for various solvers and reconstruction orders for the fiducial FF model. Each model is independently\nnormalized so that the total initial energy (TE+BE+KE) is unity. The\nfinal energies differ by at most \u223c 17%, which is significant but much\nless pronounced than in the PB model.\n\nmagnetic energy is converted into kinetic energy. Since the\nHLLD approximate Riemann solver contains a more physically complete description of the breakdown of the Riemann\nproblem at the cell interface for the RMHD equations than\nthe HLLE approximate Riemann solver, we adopt the HLLD\nsolver as our standard of comparison and utilize it for all of\nthe simulations presented in \u00a73.\nWhile the algorithms implemented in Athena are overall second-order accurate in space and time, extensive testing has revealed that use of third-order spatial reconstruction can lower truncation error and increase the accuracy of\nthe solution (Stone et al. 2008). One might expect therefore,\n\n\f6\n\nO'Neill et al.\n\nFigure 4. A resolution study of energetics for the PB models, comparing the fiducial model PB (lines) with a model in which the physical\nresolution is doubled (glyphs). Each model is independently normalized so that the total initial energy (TE+BE+KE) is unity. The models exhibit good convergence, suggesting that the evolution of smallscale structure does not dominate the energetics of the system.\n\nthat the divergence in flow morphology and energy evolution\nbetween solutions computed using the HLLE and HLLD approximate Riemann solvers can be ameliorated by improving\nthe accuracy of spatial reconstruction from second to third\norder for the HLLE Riemann solver. The data of Figures 2\nand 3 show that, in the PB models, the asymptotic value of\nthe kinetic energy using 2nd-order reconstruction is a factor of \u223c 1.4 times that of 3rd-order reconstruction, while for\nthe FF models, the ordering is reversed, with 3rd-order reconstruction producing kinetic energies roughly 18% greater\nthan 2nd-order. From this, we conclude that while the use\nof third-order reconstruction in combination with the HLLE\nsolver does reduce differences in flow energetics between Riemann solvers in the FF case, the more complex dynamics introduced when (e.g.) gas pressure plays a significant role in\nforce balance are best captured by the use of the more physically complete HLLD approximate Riemann solver, even at\nlower spatial accuracy. This result is consistent with expectations derived from extensive comparisons between high-order\n(e.g. WENO5) schemes and second-order Godunov methods, where it was demonstrated that, for non-linear problems, both high order schemes and second-order Godunov\nmethods converge at first order (Greenough & Rider 2004).\nThese authors conclude that, while higher order methods deliver higher accuracy solutions at fixed computational cost for\nsmooth solutions, for non-linear problems second-order Godunov methods deliver higher accuracy solutions than higher\norder schemes (again, at fixed computational cost). As a result, we adopt second-order spatial reconstruction for the all\nof the simulations presented in \u00a73.\nThe simulations presented here were conducted in ideal\nrelativistic MHD, and, as a result, none of the solutions in the\nnonlinear regime can be regarded as 'converged'. For convergence, a physical dissipation scale (provided by either, e.g., a\nNavier-Stokes viscosity or Ohmic resistivity) would have to be\nincluded in the problem (Beckwith & Stone 2011). Such calculations are extremely challenging in relativistic MHD (see\ne.g. Takamoto & Inoue 2011) and are well beyond the scope\n\nFigure 5.

A resolution study of energetics for the FF models, comparing the fiducial model FF (lines) with a model in which the physical\nresolution is doubled (glyphs). Each model is independently normalized so that the total initial energy (TE+BE+KE) is unity. The models\nexhibit good convergence during the linear growth phase, but the kinetic energy evolves differently at the \u223c 30% level well after CDI\nsaturation.\n\nof the current work. In addition, it is likely that in relativistic, magnetized astrophysical jets, the dissipation scale would\nbe separated by many orders of magnitude from the smallest scales accessible by current computational resources. Instead, convergence of the solution must be judged during the\nlinear growth phase of CDI. Using the choices of Riemann\nsolver and order of spatial reconstruction outlined previously\n(i.e. the HLLD approximate Riemann solver and second order spatial reconstruction), we compute simulations of the\nPB, RPB and FF cases described in \u00a72.1 at both the fiducial\nresolution (256 \u00d7 256 \u00d7 128 zones) and at twice this resolution (using otherwise identical configurations).

Magnetic field isosurfaces for the fiducial PB model at four different times (specified in units of \u03c4A ). All variants of the PB model are\neventually subject to CDI, becoming completely disrupted over time.\n\nFigure 4\u20136 demonstrate that the linear growth phase associated with each class of initial condition (PB: t . 7\u03c4A ; RPB:\nt . 15\u03c4A ; FF: t . 75\u03c4A ) is well converged at the fiducial resolution of 256 \u00d7 256 \u00d7 128 zones, which we utilize for the remainder of this work. While the subsequent, non-linear, stage\nof the evolution cannot be used to judge convergence of the\nmodels, it is instructive to examine the differences that arise\nat higher resolution. Model PB exhibits non-linear evolution\nthat differs by . 5% between the fiducial and higher resolutions; both quantitative and qualitative conclusions drawn\nfrom the fiducial resolution during the non-linear evolution\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nwill therefore remain unchanged at higher resolution for this\nmodel. Models RPB and FF exhibit non-linear evolutions that\ndiffer by \u223c 35% between the two resolutions at late times. In\nboth cases, the qualitative non-linear evolution is not strongly\naffected by resolution, however. For the RPB model in particular, the ratio of the magnetic-to-kinetic energy remains qualitatively similar (i.e. approximate equipartition) during the\nnon-linear stage. As a result, we conclude that while quantitative conclusions drawn concerning the non-linear behaviors\nof models RPB and FF will be subject to resolution effects,\n\n\f8\n\nO'Neill et al.\n\nFigure 8. Magnetic field isosurfaces for the fiducial rotating RPB model at four different times (specified in units of \u03c4A ). As is the case for the PB\nmodels, the RPB models eventually become disrupted, although their field strengths remain generally higher than those of the PB models.\n\nqualitative conclusions regarding the physics at work in these\nmodels will be resolution independent.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nRESULTS\nMorphology\n\nTo begin, we will discuss the distinct morphological evolutions that result from the three different classes of initial force\nbalance. Here, we will focus primarily on comparing the fiducial models (PB, RPB, and FF), deferring a detailed discussion\n\nof the other models to our analysis of the system energetics.\nFigures 7-9 show snapshots of the evolution of magnetic field\nstrength in models PB, RPB, and FF. The fields are shown\nas isosurfaces, which is sufficient to illustrate the degree to\nwhich the field structures bend and/or become disrupted as\nthe systems evolve.\nFigures 7 and 8 show that both the PB and RPB columns\nare strongly disrupted, eventually showing clear signs of turbulent evolution. Model PB, in particular, features field structures that emerge on a large variety of spatial scales, ranging\nfrom the size of the system to smaller scales that are obvic 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fCDI Morphology and Energetics\n\n9\n\nFigure 9. Magnetic field isosurfaces for the fiducial FF model at four different times (specified in units of \u03c4A ). Unlike the PB/RPB models, the\nFF models are merely deformed, rather than completely disrupted. Although the system continues to evolve slowly after t \u223c 100 \u03c4A , the gross\nmorphology does not change dramatically after this time.\n\nously not directly relatable to the initial |m| = 1 scale perturbation. Additionally, the PB column begins to become disarranged quite rapidly, in less than 10 \u03c4A , and achieves some\ndegree of turbulence by 20 \u03c4A . Considering that the system\nhas also expanded to become larger than the initial column\nradius used to characterize \u03c4A , this is rapid evolution indeed.\nThe RPB model, too, becomes disrupted, with notable\ndifferences from the PB model. One dissimilarity is a result\nof the system's rotation. Because the perturbation is initially\nnon-axisymmetric, rotation strongly affects the orientation of\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nthe initial deformation and subsequent evolution. We also find\nthat the RPB model appears to deform less rapidly than model\nPB. One might naively have assumed that the RPB model\nwould only evolve more rapidly than model PB, given that\nthe two systems have similar initial field configurations and\nthat rotation provides an additional source of free energy in\nthe RPB system. In detail, however, the two models also feature different initial pressure gradients to satisfy Equation 2.\nThis can further affect the magnetic field strength since it is\nonly the minimum value of \u03b2 that is constrained, meaning\n\n\f10\n\nO'Neill et al.\n\nFigure 10. Relating the direction of column deformation to the initial perturbation for the PB model (left), the RPB model (center), and the FF\nmodel (right). Solid lines show the angular orientation of the initial perturbation as a function of z, where the glyphs depict the center-of-mass\n(COM) and the average location of the magnetic field (COB) at late times. In all cases, the magnetic field and center-of-mass are close to 180\ndegrees out of phase, which is not surprising since the field expands into a region of initially uniform density. For the PB and FF models, the\nmagnetic field is clearly correlated with the direction of the initial perturbation, as we would expect. The RPB model features an evolved state\nthat is shifted in phase as a result of the system's rotation.\n\nthat this value can be achieved at different locations in different models. That the RPB and PB models evolve over different timescales simply illustrates that the characteristic Alfv\u00e9n\ncrossing time alone may not always be perfectly indicative of\nthe CDI evolution timescale, particularly if the system is undergoing significant evolution. We further note that the final\nfield structure in model RPB does not appear to have accessed\nas large a range of spatial scales as model PB. This is again\nlikely to be a result of the slower evolution of this system.\nFinally, Figure 9 illustrates that the FF model is deformed\nbut not completely disrupted. Specifically, it is clear that the\ncolumn reacts to the initial perturbation, but it is equally obvious that no smaller scales develop appreciable power as the\nsystem evolves. Furthermore, there is very little morphological change in the system after t \u223c 100 \u2212 200 \u03c4A , especially\nwhere the strongest field is located. This is obviously a completely different regime of behavior from what was seen in\nthose models that achieved initial force balance through a\ncombination of magnetic and pressure forces. Whereas model\nPB becomes largely disrupted by 20 \u03c4A , model FF continues\nto be dominated by the |m| = 1 large-scale deformation even\nafter evolving for 600 \u03c4A and shows no sign of turbulence.\nTo demonstrate that we are in fact seeing these systems\nrespond to the applied perturbation, we show in Figure 10\nthe relationship between the deformation of the column and\nthe direction of the applied perturbation as a function of the\nposition along the column axis. Specifically, we look at the\nangular position of both the center-of-mass (COM), defined\nin a given direction as \u03a3\u03c1i xi /\u03a3\u03c1i , and the analogous quantity for the magnetic pressure (COB), defined as \u03a3Bi2 xi /\u03a3Bi2 .\nHere, the Newtonian expressions for the density, position, and\nthe magnetic field are adequate to provide a qualitative sense\nof whether or not the perturbation and subsequent evolution\nare aligned. For models PB and FF, Figure 10 illustrates that\nthe orientations of the COB (asterisks) and the initial perturbation (lines) are well-correlated at all heights within in the\ncolumn. In contrast, the COM (plus signs) is out of phase by \u03c0\nradians in these two models. Together, these facts suggest that\nthe magnetic fields move in the direction of the initial perturbation while the mass moves in the opposite direction. This\nis not terribly surprising, given that a deformed set of magnetic field isosurfaces will generally expand to bound a larger\n\nvolume than initially cylindrical isosurfaces. The density inside such a region is observed to decrease accordingly as a\nconsequence of this expansion (and the magnetic flux freezing captured in ideal MHD), leading to the center of mass\nbecoming displaced in the opposite direction. In practice, this\nprocess leads to only a small overall displacement of the center of mass because so much of the mass in the outer portions\nof the grid is located in regions of weak or zero magnetization and subsequently does not move. In model RPB, we see\nsimilar behavior as in model PB, but shifted out of phase as\na result of the system's rotation. In this model, different time\nsnapshots would naturally feature different phase shifts.\n3.2\n\nEnergetics\n\nTo understand how and why these different morphologies\nevolve, we now examine the details of energy flow in these\nsystems. Our primary goal is to determine the degree to which\nthe magnetic energy is being converted into kinetic energy as\nwould be indicative of CDI. Furthermore, we seek to determine whether or not this behavior saturates and what levels\nof kinetic energy amplification are attained through the action of CDI. Before proceeding, we should define precisely\nwhat we mean when discussing the various forms of energy. In practice, Athena treats the total energy, defined as\n\u03c1h\u03932 \u2212 p + |B|2 /2 + [|v|2 |B|2 \u2212 (v * B)2 ]/2, where h is the\nrelativistic enthalpy and \u0393 is the Lorentz factor (e.g., Mignone\net al. 2007, Beckwith & Stone 2011). Subtracting off the rest\nmass energy, the kinetic energy is KE = (\u0393 \u2212 1)\u0393\u03c1. The magnetic energy is taken to be all terms containing the magnetic\nfield, such that BE = |B|2 /2 + [|v|2 |B|2 \u2212 (v * B)2 ]/2. In\nour models, the velocity terms in the magnetic energy expression are typically measured to be less than one percent of the\ntotal magnetic energy, indicative of the characteristically low\nvelocities achieved in these flows. The thermal energy is the\nremainder after the rest mass, kinetic energy, and thermal energies have been subtracted from the total energy.\n\n3.2.1\n\nFiducial Models\n\nFigures 11-13 show the energy evolution for models PB, RPB,\nand FF. In each case, the figures depict the average energy\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fCDI Morphology and Energetics\n\nFigure 11. Energy evolution over time for the fiducial PB model, normalized so that the total initial energy (TE+BE+KE) is unity, where\nTE=thermal energy, BE=magnetic energy, and KE=kinetic energy.\nThe exchange of magnetic into kinetic energy reflects the development of CDI, which appears to saturate after several \u03c4A . The cyan\nregion indicates the approximate time range over which CDI experience linear growth.\n\ncontained in each form (kinetic, magnetic, and thermal) as\nmeasured over the entire computational grid and normalized\nsuch that the total initial energy is unity. Although some energy exits through the open computational boundaries at late\ntimes as these models evolve, this normalization reflects the\ntotal energy measured at any given time with an accuracy\nof better than two percent for all of our fiducial simulations.\nFor all three fiducial models, the initial energy distribution\nis dominated by thermal energy with the magnetic energy\ncomprising at most a few percent of the total grid energy. Of\ncourse, one should keep in mind that this relative ordering is\nlargely an artifact of the grid size convolved with the radial\nprofile of initial magnetic energy. Clearly, magnetic energy can\nmake up a substantially larger fraction of the total energy in\nlocal regions where the field is stronger, and in fact all fiducial\nmodels feature a minimum \u03b2 < 1. In each model, the kinetic\nenergy attributable to the applied perturbation is a very small\nfraction of the initial total energy, as can be seen in Figures\n11 and 13. The perturbation is equally small for model RPB\n(Figure 12), but that model also features a non-negligible (at\nthe 2% level) amount of initial kinetic energy reflecting the\nrotation profile.\nIn Figure 11, we can see the basic pattern of energy exchange that reflects the development of CDI. Specifically, the\ntotal kinetic energy on the grid in model PB increases by\napproximately four orders of magnitude over several Alfv\u00e9n\ncrossing times. During that same time period, the magnetic\nenergy begins to decrease. The kinetic energy increase begins\nto roll over at t \u223c 6.5 \u03c4A , achieving the peak amplitude at\nt \u223c 7 \u03c4A . After this time, both the kinetic and magnetic energies show a decrease that is attributable primarily to turbulent dissipation into thermal energy and some loss off of\nthe computational boundaries orthogonal to the column axis.\nThis picture is consistent with the morphological evolution of\nmodel PB (Figure 7) in which the column bends, increasing\nthe total kinetic energy, and eventually reaches a turbulent\nstate in which the kinetic energy increases are offset by disc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n11\n\nFigure 12. Energy evolution over time for the fiducial RPB model,\nnormalized so that the total initial energy (TE+BE+KE) is unity. In\nthis case, the total kinetic energy (which includes rotational energy)\nactually decreases and kinetic/magnetic energy follow the same trend\nafter a few tens of \u03c4A , both decreasing as they dissipate into thermal\nenergy.\n\nFigure 13. Energy evolution over time for the fiducial FF model,\nnormalized so that the total initial energy (TE+BE+KE) is unity. Although the CDI initially act to amplify the kinetic energy at the expense of magnetic energy, the overall levels of kinetic energy are always far below those of the magnetic and kinetic energy (unlike the\nfiducial PB and RPB models). The cyan region indicates the approximate time range over which the CDI experience linear growth.\n\nsipation into thermal energy. The cyan region of Figure 11\ndepicts the approximate range of time over which the CDI undergo linear growth. In this region, we measure the maximum\ngrowth rate of the instability to be approximately 2.0 \u03c4A\u22121 for\nthe fiducial PB system.\nWe can compare this growth rate to analytic estimates\nthat have been constructed for physically analogous systems.\nBegelman (1998), for example, provides a framework for estimating the growth rate of the toroidal field CDI under very\ngeneral circumstances. By inserting the initial conditions of\nour PB model into this framework, we can compute the expected CDI growth rate on a zone-by-zone basis within our\ncomputational grid to find the maximum. Combining the ex-\n\n\f12\n\nO'Neill et al.\n\nFigure 14. Energetics as they depend upon the details of rotation in RPB models, independently normalized so that the total initial energy\n(TE+BE+KE) is unity. In model RPB-slow (center), the rotational velocity is halved from the case of the fiducial model RPB (left). The kinetic and\nmagnetic energies in each run converge to similar values, even though the kinetic/magnetic energies in models RPB-slow and RBP are initially\nboth different and differently ordered. In model RPB-xrot (right), the rotation profile is extended radially beyond the magnetized region, which\nlessens this strong connection between the kinetic and magnetic energies. While all three RPB models succumb to CDI, the global energy profiles\ndepend upon the spatial partitioning of energy in the system.\n\npressions provided in equations 3.18 and 4.8 of Begelman\n(1998) and inserting our initial values, we find that the maximum expected growth rate in model PB is \u223c 1.9 \u03c4A\u22121 . This\nis within five percent of the value measured from the energy evolution of our simulation shown in Figure 11. Moreover, this demonstrates that maximum growth is actually being achieved in a large enough region of the grid that this rate\ndominates the energetics of the system.\nThe energy evolution in the fiducial rotating system RPB,\non the other hand, is very different than that of model PB\neven though both columns deform and develop turbulence.\nAs Figure 12 illustrates, the magnetic energy first experiences\na period of growth and is never reduced to the levels seen in\nmodel PB. This is consistent with the visual impression from\nFigure 8 that there are characteristically stronger fields in that\nmodel than appear in model PB (Figure 7). Moreover, after\napproximately 14 \u03c4A , the kinetic and magnetic energies in\nmodel RPB follow very similar trends, decreasing to nearly\nidentical values. As we will soon see, the degree to which\nthese quantities are coupled will depend upon the details of\nthe rotation profile. In practice, it is challenging to derive an\naccurate growth rate for CDI in rotating systems from the energy profiles alone since the kinetic energy due to rotation is\nsimultaneously evolving in time. For that reason, we limit our\ncurrent discussion of growth rates to the PB and FF classes of\nsimulation.\nFinally, the energy evolution of model FF (Figure 13) is\ngrossly similar to that of model PB despite the very different\ncolumn morphologies that the two models develop. The primary differences in their energy evolution are that the kinetic\nenergy in model FF experiences a growth of only approximately two orders of magnitude before saturating and that\nthe peak amplitude of the kinetic energy is achieved at a much\nlater time, around 110 \u2212 130 \u03c4A . Additionally, we note that\nthe growth depicted in Figure 13 appears to have two distinct\nphases, featuring a roughly constant slope from t = 0 \u2212 35 \u03c4A ,\nwhereupon it steepens until saturation. Moreover, the level of\nkinetic energy always remains a small fraction of the total\nenergy, reaching only a tenth of one percent at maximum.\nThus, we see that CDI do act to increase the kinetic energy in\nboth the FF and PB configurations, but also that the levels to\nwhich the kinetic energy is amplified depend strongly upon\n\nthe model parameters. The cyan region in Figure 13 again\nmarks the period of linear growth. In the case of the fiducial\nmodel FF, the initial growth rate is \u223c 0.04 \u03c4A\u22121 , although the\nmaximum growth rate at later times (but prior to saturation)\nis approximately twice this value.\nIn the case of an initially force-free field, we can compare this growth rate to that analytically estimated by Appl\net al. (2000), for example. This work provides a very simple\nclosed expression for the growth rate in their Table 1, which\nis \u03c9max \u223c 0.13vA for force-free fields of constant pitch angle\n(identical to those of model FF). This translates in our case\nto \u03c9max \u223c 0.04, which is identical to the initial growth measured in our simulations. Again, this is approximately a factor of two less than the maximum growth that is eventually\nachieved before saturation of the CDI, but it may be that the\ncolumn evolution changes the Alfv\u00e9n speed sufficiently in portions of the column that higher growth is achievable at later\ntimes. An alternative interpretation is that this second phase\nof linear growth reflects the development of a different mode\nnumber, but the presence of such a mode is not easily inferred\nfrom examination of the flow morphology. It is important to\nnote that both the morphology and linear CDI growth rate of\nour FF model appear to be very similar to those reported in\nMizuno et al. (2009) for a nearly identical field model, which\nthey refer to as their \u03b1 = 1 case.\n\n3.2.2\n\nThe Effects of Initial Conditions\n\nTo explore how the evolution of CDI depends upon the physical parameters in our models, we first examine how the details of rotation contribute to the system energetics in the\nRPB models. Specifically, we seek to determine the origin of\nthe increased magnetic energy seen in Figure 12 that seemingly runs contrary to the usual CDI development. Figure 14\nshows a comparison of the fiducial rotating model RPB (left)\nwith models RPB-slow (center), in which v\u03c6 is decreased, and\nRPB-xrot (right), in which the profile is extended to larger\nradii. Model RPB-slow also shows a strong convergence of\nkinetic and magnetic energies despite the fact that, unlike\nmodel RPB, the system was initialized with more magnetic\nthan kinetic energy. This suggests that the two forms of energy are very likely to co-evolve whenever the CDI become\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fCDI Morphology and Energetics\n\nFigure 15. The evolution of kinetic energy over time as a function\nof \u03b2 for models PB (solid line), PB-\u03b23 (dotted line), and PB-\u03b230\n(dashed line). For each model, the initial kinetic energy is independently normalized to unity. Scaling the evolution by the modeldependent Alfv\u00e9n time (\u03c4A ) illustrates that the linear growth rate of\nCDI is relatively model independent, although the magnitude of the\ntotal amplification and turnover time both increase with increasing\n\u03b2.\n\nactive, somewhat independent of which energy form is dominant. Although we have not attempted to identify the exact\ndetails of this energy transfer, one can imagine a mechanism\nnot unlike the magnetorotational instability (Balbus & Hawley 1991) operating to convert rotational energy to magnetic\nenergy once the column has deformed sufficiently that the\ntoroidal field can experience radial shear. Of course, this presupposes that the two forms of energy are distributed similarly. The rightmost panel of Figure 14 illustrates that a rotation profile extended beyond the magnetized region leads to\nparallel, but well-separated energy evolution, as one would\nexpect.\nWe are also interested in determining how CDI development is affected by magnetic field strength as parameterized\nby the plasma \u03b2. Figure 15 shows how the kinetic energy evolution in the PB series of models varies with three different\nfield strengths, reflecting both subthermal and superthermal\nconfigurations. In all cases, the initial perturbation was set\nto the same (small) fraction of the initial maximum Alfv\u00e9n\nspeed, meaning that the initial kinetic energies differed between models. We have therefore independently normalized\nthe initial kinetic energies to unity so that we may more easily\ncross-compare the models. Clearly, Figure 15 illustrates that\nthe linear growth stages of the CDI are not dramatically affected by the initial field strength. The growth is not only parallel but nearly identical for each model until approximately\n5 \u03c4A , where the models begin to differentiate from one another. Specifically, the maximum saturation level and saturation time both appear to increase with increasing \u03b2 (i.e., reduced field strengths).\nAdditionally, we would like to know the importance of\nthe magnetic field profile in determining the evolution of\nthe CDI. Figure 16 shows the evolution of the alternate\nKomissarov-type magnetic field that is counterbalanced by a\ngas pressure gradient. Both runs clearly show evidence of kinetic energy enhancement as a result of CDI. As measured\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n13\n\nFigure 16. Comparing the kinetic and magnetic energy evolution between the fiducial PB model (lines) with model PB-kom (glyphs),\nwhich features a Komissarov-type field profile. Each model is independently normalized so that the total initial energy (TE+BE+KE) is\nunity. While both models are disrupted by the CDI, the details of the\nenergetics, including the CDI growth rate, differ according to the initial field geometry and energy distributions. The linear growth rates\nare comparable to those predicted analytically for the two configurations.\n\nfrom the kinetic energy evolution, the CDI growth rates in the\ntwo models are comparable but not identical, suggesting that\nthe exact distributions of field and gas pressure do play a role\nin determining the system evolution, as the analytic theory\npresented in Begelman (1998) suggests. The growth rate in\nmodel PB-kom is measured to be \u223c 1.39 \u03c4A\u22121 , which is about\n70% that of model PB. If we again model the expected growth\nrate based on the expressions provided in Begelman (1998),\nwe anticipate a growth of \u03c9 \u223c 1.27 \u03c4A\u22121 , which is within 10%\nof what is measured. The other significant difference introduced by our choice of field structure is that PB-kom achieves\nequipartition between magnetic and kinetic energies while\nthe kinetic energy in model PB evolves to exceed equipartition. We should avoid over-interpreting this feature, however,\nsince the global equipartition shown in the figure will not necessarily be indicative of local energy distributions everywhere\non the grid. Specifically, one can easily imagine that the different field distributions in the two models lead to different total\nmagnetic energies even if both systems experience rather similar development of CDI. In fact, direct inspection of the data\nconfirms that there are a few local regions in model PB-kom\nwhere the kinetic and magnetic energies differ by a few orders\nof magnitude even though this is not reflected in the global\naverage.\nConsidering that there are significant morphological and\nenergetic differences between the FF and PB models, it is important to examine the role of poloidal field in the evolution\nof these systems. Specifically, we seek to determine whether\nthe presence of poloidal field is sufficient to retard the development of CDI when introduced into the PB class of models.\nFigure 17 shows the kinetic energy evolution for models PBbz1 and PB-bz0.2, in which |Bz | = |B\u03c6 | and |Bz | = 0.2|B\u03c6 |,\nrespectively. These models differ from all of the others in that\nthe magnetic pitch of these field configurations is proportional\nto the radius, rather than being constant. First, we note that\n\n\f14\n\nO'Neill et al.\n\nFigure 17. Comparing the kinetic energy evolution between the fiducial PB model (line) with models featuring poloidal fields that are\ncomparable to 100% (PB-bz1) and 20% (PB-bz0.2) of the toroidal\nfield strength. Each model is independently normalized so that the\ninitial kinetic energy is unity. The linear growth of the CDI is not dramatically affected, although the maximum kinetic energy achieved\nand saturation behaviors are dramatically different.\n\nthe linear growth of CDI is quite similar in all cases, confirming that the different growth rates seen between the FF and\nPB models cannot be attributed to the presence of a strong\npoloidal field in model FF. That said, it is clear that the linear\ngrowth terminates early for PB-bz1, suggesting that, as expected, poloidal fields do play a major role in the saturation of\nthe CDI. Furthermore, the saturation levels of the instability\ndecrease on average with increasing poloidal field strength,\nalthough with substantial fluctuations that are of order a few\ntimes the characteristic Alfv\u00e9n crossing time. Incidentally, the\ncolumn morphologies that develop for the poloidal models\nare also intermediate between those of the strongly turbulent\nPB model and the less disordered FF class of simulation.\nNext, we explore the degree to which the temperature\nof the column affects its evolution. Model FF-hot, in which\nthe gas pressure is a factor of ten greater than the rest mass\nenergy, is unique among our models in that special relativity\nis essential for achieving a subluminal sound speed, even in\nthe initial conditions. Figure 18 compares the evolution of\nkinetic and magnetic energy in FF-hot with the fiducial FF\nmodel. Again, both models feature clear indications of the\ndevelopment and saturation of the CDI. In fact, the energy\nevolution in model FF-hot runs roughly parallel to that of the\nfiducial model, with a displacement that reflects the different\ninitial fractional distributions of energy. This suggests that the\ntemperature of the gas, even as it enters into the properly\nrelativistic regime, does not strongly affect the development\nof the CDI.\nFinally, we examine the influence of the applied perturbation. The perturbation used in the vast majority of our models\nis a large-scale non-axisymmetric kick designed to excite the\n|m| = 1 mode of the CDI. Generally, this kick has a strength\nof approximately one percent of the initial maximum Alfv\u00e9n\nspeed so that the system is excited, but not initially pushed\ntoo far away from the equilibrium state. Still, it is worth determining whether or not the exact magnitude of this kick affects\nthe evolution of CDI in a significant manner. Figure 19 depicts\n\nFigure 18. Comparing the kinetic and magnetic energy evolution between the fiducial FF model (lines) and model FF-hot (glyphs), in\nwhich the gas is relativistically hot (i.e., p \u223c 10\u03c1). Each model is independently normalized so that the total initial energy (TE+BE+KE)\nis unity. The two models feature similar CDI growth rates and parallel\nlong-term evolution.\n\nthe energy evolution of initially force-free models in which\nthe kicks were 6% (FF-v6) and 25% (FF-v25) of the maximum\nAlfv\u00e9n speed in otherwise identical simulations. The most obvious difference between these models naturally appears in\nthe overall kinetic energy levels, which reflect the higher initial kinetic energies associated with larger kicks. Otherwise,\nthe evolution of CDI, particularly in the non-linear phases,\nruns roughly parallel for each different model, suggesting that\nthe precise value of the kick is not particularly important for\nthe evolution of the system.\nOne may also explicitly test to determine whether the\n|m| = 1 mode is really the CDI mode that we should be exploring. Linear theory tells us that this is under many conditions the fastest growing mode (e.g., Begelman 1998), but\nit is important to check that this mode is naturally excited\nby a more generic perturbation than is employed in most\nof our models. Figure 20 compares the fiducial PB and FF\nmodels with their randomly perturbed analogues, PB-vrand\n(left) and FF-vrand (right). Here, the random perturbations\nare generated by using a random number generator to produce a random (in strength and orientation) velocity in each\ncomputational zone such that the RMS velocity magnitude as\nmeasured over the entire grid is comparable to the maximum\nkick applied in the fiducial models. This is an admittedly simple test that would not, for example, be expected to converge\nnumerically for increasing resolution, given that the perturbations are applied at the grid scale. Still, if CDI develop on\nlarge scales naturally from this type of perturbation, we can\nrest assured that our simulations reflect a fairly robust set of\ngeneric outcomes.\nIn Figure 20, we see the telltale sign of CDI development, namely a clear increase in the kinetic energy on the\ngrid. There are some interesting points to note, however. First,\nthe PB and PB-vrand models (right) achieve rather similar\nmagnetic energy evolution, but different kinetic energy progressions. Specifically, the kinetic energy in model PB-vrand\ndemonstrates a slightly different growth rate and saturation\nlevel from that of the fiducial model PB. This is not entirely\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fCDI Morphology and Energetics\n\n15\n\n[b]\n\nFigure 19. Energy evolution in the FF models as it depends upon perturbation magnitude for kinetic energy (left) and magnetic energy (right).\nEach model is independently normalized so that the total initial energy (TE+BE+KE) is unity. Larger perturbations (e.g., FF-v25) obviously lead\nto larger initial/final kinetic energies, but all perturbations produce roughly parallel evolutions at late times.\n\nFigure 20. Energy evolution in the PB (left) and FF (right) models, comparing whether or not the system is subjected to an organized |m| = 1\nperturbation (lines) or a random perturbation (glyphs). Each model is independently normalized so that the total initial energy (TE+BE+KE) is\nunity. Both models are obviously subject to the growth of CDI from random perturbations, but the PB model is more affected by the details of the\nperturbation than is the FF model, which is simply displaced in time.\n\nunexpected since the velocity field has time to modify the\npressure (and field) profiles, both of which can affect the CDI\ngrowth rate in pressure-supported columns, before the CDI\nhave finished growing. Additionally, model PB-vrand achieves\napproximate equipartition between magnetic and kinetic energies at saturation, which is different from the PB model for\nwhich the kinetic energy eventually exceeds the magnetic energy globally. In the FF and FF-vrand models, on the other\nhand, we see that the kinetic energies evolve quite similarly,\nwhich is consistent with the fact that the analytic growth rate\nestimate for force-free columns includes only the characteristic Alfv\u00e9n speed and radius, neither of which should change\ndramatically as a result of a random perturbation. The only\nsignificant difference is an offset in time, but this is only natural given that the |m| = 1 mode was not specifically excited.\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n3.2.3\n\nIncluding Alternative Physics\n\nIn addition to exploring the influence of our choice of model\nparameters, we also seek to determine the significance of the\nincluded physics. For example, although it is not obvious that\nthese systems experience a significant amount of compression\nas they evolve, it is worth determining whether a change of\nthe adiabatic index has any noticeable effects. Figure 21 compares the evolution of fiducial model PB with that of PB-g1.33\nin which the adiabatic index of 4/3 corresponding to a relativistic fluid is employed. There are essentially no important\ndifferences between these two models beyond an approximately 10% deviation in the amount by which the kinetic\nenergy is amplified after 20 Alfv\u00e9n crossing times. This is a\nminor enough discrepancy that we can safely conclude that\nthe value of the adiabatic index does not play a major role\n\n\f16\n\nO'Neill et al.\n\nFigure 21. Comparing the effects of the value of the adiabatic index between the fiducial model PB (lines) with \u03b3 = 5/3 and model\nPB-g1.33 (glyphs), in which \u03b3 = 4/3. Each model is independently\nnormalized so that the total initial energy (TE+BE+KE) is unity. The\nmodel evolution is fairly insensitive to this parameter, with maximum\ndeviations of approximately 10% in the kinetic and magnetic energies\nby the end of the evolution.\n\nin the evolution of CDI. One could imagine also investigating\nthe effects of a variable Synge-type (Synge 1957) equation of\nstate, but the relatively small ranges of temperature (a factor\nof 10, typically) achieved in a given CDI simulation suggest\nthat this would not have a major effect on these models.\nA more fundamental physical difference may be expected\nto result from the incorporation of special relativistic physics.\nWhile our models are always initialized with low fluid velocities, the Alfv\u00e9n speeds in these magnetized columns can be\nquite large. Specifically, the fiducial models all feature maximum vA > 0.1, with the FF model having initial values as high\nas vA = 0.32. This is sufficiently large that it is not obvious\nhow significant a role special relativity will play in regulating this speed as the flow evolves. Furthermore, it is unclear\nwhether the fluid velocities that develop as a result of CDI will\nbe high enough to be strongly affected by the natural speed\nlimit imposed by special relativity.\nFigures 22 and 23 show the evolution of the PB-newt\nand FF-newt models, respectively. It is initially surprising that\nthe FF models are actually less sensitive to the inclusion of\nspecial relativity than are the PB models, despite their nominally larger initial maximum Alfv\u00e9n velocities. Direct examination of the data reveals that this is likely attributable to the\nlarger flow velocities achieved in the PB models. When the PB\ncolumns are disrupted, small regions can attain velocities of\nup to nearly 0.14c. This is three times the maximum velocity reached in the FF models and sufficient to be affected by\nthe presence/absence of relativity. As a result, the fiducial PB\nmodel features a final kinetic energy that is nearly 1.5 times\nthat of model PB-newt, while the FF models differ by only\na few percent. This demonstrates that relativity does play a\nrole in the evolution of these models, but also that special relativistic effects do not dominate the energetics, as might be\nexpected in simulations featuring relativistic shear layers or\nrotation profiles.\n\nFigure 22. A comparison between the fiducial model PB (lines) and\nits Newtonian analog, model PB-newt (glyphs). Each model is independently normalized so that the total initial energy (TE+BE+KE) is\nunity. The two models evolve in a similar fashion, although deviations\ncan be seen, particularly in the kinetic energy where the relativistic\nvalue is ultimately 50% greater than that of the Newtonian case.\n\nFigure 23. A comparison between the fiducial model FF (lines) and\nits Newtonian analog, model FF-newt (glyphs). Each model is independently normalized so that the total initial energy (TE+BE+KE) is\nunity. The FF models evolve more similarly than the PB models, with\nonly a few percent differences between relativistic and Newtonian\nphysics.\n\n4\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have reported on an ensemble of local co-moving jet simulations designed to explore the role of current-driven instabilities in magnetized plasma columns. Our most significant\ndiscovery is that the details of initial force balance have a\ndramatic impact on the resulting column morphology. Despite\nthe fact that the force-free, pressure-supported, and rotationsupported magnetized columns under consideration are all\nnominally unstable to CDI, they clearly develop structures\nthat are very dissimilar from one another. Specifically, our\nforce-free columns undergo a relatively modest degree of\ndeformation that slows dramatically when the CDI achieve\nnon-linear saturation. The pressure-balanced columns, on the\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fCDI Morphology and Energetics\nother hand, shred and develop turbulent structures that facilitate continued mixing throughout the evolution of the system.\nWhile the inclusion of rotation in pressure-supported systems\nadjusts some of the details, these models too are characteristically unstable and undergo significant mixing resulting from\nthe combination of CDI and radial shear.\nDespite these grossly different morphologies, the general pattern of CDI energy evolution is similar for all models. All systems experience a linear growth phase of the CDI,\nwhich we have found matches analytic predictions with a\nhigh degree of accuracy. The force-free fields generally experience much slower rates of CDI development and less kinetic\nenergy amplification than their pressure-supported counterparts. Perhaps the most interesting energy exchange occurs in\nthe rotating systems, where mixing ensures that spatially colocated kinetic and magnetic energies will evolve to approximate equipartition, regardless of their initial ordering. Considering that most astrophysical winds and jets should possess some amount of angular momentum, with AGN jets being particularly likely to feature very rapid rotation near their\nsource, this largely unrecognized channel of energy exchange\ncould potentially be very important.\nMoreover, we have shown that these behaviors are fairly\ngeneric outcomes for a wide range of physical and numerical\nparameters. The strength and/or structure of the magnetic\nfield, for example, makes much less difference than whether\nthe initial force balance was achieved through force-free\nfields, pressure gradients, or rotation. Introducing a poloidal\nfield component into a pressure-supported configuration does\nnot affect the linear growth rate of CDI, although it does eventually adjust the non-linear saturation properties. The adiabatic index or neglect of special relativity makes only a minor\ndifference, although we have yet to merge special relativity\nand rotation in a single model. One expects that special relativity will play a far greater role in affecting flows bounded\nby a strong shear layer and/or rotating at relativistic speeds.\nNumerical considerations prove to be some of the most\nsignificant factors in determining the non-linear states of\nthese systems. Although the choice of Riemann solver and\nvariable reconstruction order do not strongly impact the linear growth phase of CDI, the peak kinetic energy attained\nand saturation levels are affected by algorithmic choices to a\ndegree beyond most of the physical parameters that we varied. This serves as a useful reminder that not all numerical\napproaches are equally applicable to all problems and, specifically, that the HLLE solver should be avoided for problems in\nwhich it is important to resolve contact and rotational discontinuities. Given that the effective resolution of HLLD is greater\nthan that of HLLE (e.g., Mignone et al. 2009), this is likely to\nbe even more of an issue for global jet simulations that typically employ lower physical resolutions over larger domains\nthan their local counterparts.\nThe different methods of force balance correspond to\ndistinct regions of astrophysical parameter space. Force-free\nfield configurations in pulsar winds or astrophysical jets, for\nexample, are most likely to occur nearest to points of origin. Simple arguments about flux conservation suggest that\ntoroidal field will eventually dominate over poloidal field in\nany geometrically expanding jet or asymmetric wind (Begelman et al. 1984). Furthermore, particles are more likely to\nbe heated by dissipation downstream of their origin, with\nbaryons in particular retaining this heat more easily than elecc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n17\n\ntrons or positrons. This provides a convergence of evidence\nthat pressure-supported models are more relevant at greater\ndistances from the source.\nThat AGN jets are observed to be collimated over many\norders of magnitude in physical scale, however, suggests that\nthe disruptive behaviors seen in our pressure-supported and\nrotating columns do not completely dissociate real, astrophysical systems. One obvious difference between our current\nmodels and astrophysical jets is the presence of a confining\nmedium that forms a shear layer with the jet. If nothing else,\nsuch a layer would certainly interact with and modify any CDI\nmodes that intersected it, as has been seen in simulations by\nBaty & Keppens (2002) and Mizuno et al. (2011), for example. Under some circumstances, the shear layer would also be\nexpected to develop KHI modes that would have the potential\nboth to disrupt the shear layer and to interact with the existing CDI modes. It is also possible, as has been suggested in\nthe weak-field limit by Baty & Keppens (2002), that the KHI\nand CDI modes conspire to stabilize the jet against disruption.\nIt may even be that the details of jet rotation and the shear\nlayer have a pronounced effect on whether or not jets are\nstable against CDI, which may reconcile the results of global\nsimulations conducted by McKinney & Blandford (2009) and\nMignone et al. (2010), for example. We will explore the interactions between the models we have presented here and a\nshear layer in a future work.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank the anonymous referee for their helpful comments.
