The structure and stability of nonlinear optical modes is determined by the\ninterplay of the radiation field with the functional form\nof the material nonlinearity [3]. In the case of optical beams the nonlinear response can be described in\nterms of the induced change in the refractive index n\nwhich is often approximated as a local function of the\nwave intensity, i.e. n(r) = n(I(r)). However, in many\nreal physical systems the nonlinear response is spatially\nnonlocal which means that the refractive index depends\non the beam intensity in the neighborhood of each spatial point.\nR This can be phenomenologically expressed as\nn(r) = dr\u2032 K(r, r\u2032 )I(r\u2032 ), where the response kernel K\ndepends on the particular model of nonlocality [4].\nIt has been shown that nonlocality drastically affects\nthe stationary structure and dynamics of spatial solitons,\nleading to such effects as collapse arrest of high intensity\nbeams and stabilization of otherwise unstable complex\nsolitonic structures [5, 6, 7, 8]. Nonlocality is often the\nconsequence of transport processes which include atom\nor heat diffusion in atomic vapors [9], plasma [10] and\nthermal media [11], or charge drift in photorefractive\ncrystals [12]. In addition long range interactions are responsible for a nonlocal response in liquid crystals [13] or\ndipolar Bose Einstein condensates [14].\nHot atomic vapors are an important and widely used\nnonlinear medium. The nonlocal nonlinear response of\natomic vapors has previously only been associated with\nstate dependent transport of ground state atoms which\npossess a multilevel structure [9]. In this letter we introduce a new and significant mechanism of nonlocality in\natomic vapors which is provided by the ballistic transport of excited atoms and is important even for the simplest case of an idealized two-level atom. We show using\nparameters representative of beam propagation in Rubidium vapor that ballistic transport plays a dramatic\nrole leading to stabilization of otherwise unstable vortex\nmodes in the presence of a self-focusing nonlinearity.\n\nPrior to introducing a model for the nonlocal character\nof the refractive index we first recall the main features of\nbeam propagation in a hot atomic vapor. We consider\ne\u0131(kz\u2212\u03c9t) + c.c. For\na scalar traveling wave E = E(x,y,z)\n2\nall parameters of interest the refractive index is n \u2243 1 so\nthe wave intensity is I \u2243 \u01eb20 c |E|2 . In the slowly varying\nenvelope approximation the paraxial wave equation is\n\u2202E\ni 2\nk\u03c7\u2032\u2032\nk\n\u2212\n\u2207\u22a5 E = \u2212 0 E + i [\u03c7\u2032nl (I) + i\u03c7\u2032\u2032nl (I)] E, (1)\n\u2202z\n2k\n2\n2\nwhere k = \u03c9/c. The susceptibilities \u03c7\u2032 and \u03c7\u2032\u2032 depend on atomic parameters. We assume a two-level\natomic model for which the scattering cross section is\n\u0001\u22121\n, and the index\n\u03c3 = (3\u03bb2a /2\u03c0) 1 + 4\u220620 /\u03b3 2 + I/Is\nof refraction is n = 1 \u2212 na (\u03c3/k)(\u22060 /\u03b3), where \u03bba is\nthe transition wavelength, na is the atomic density, \u03b3\nis the full width at half maximum (FWHM) natural\nlinewidth, \u22060 = \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9a is the detuning between the\noptical frequency \u03c9 and the atomic transition frequency\n\u03c9a = 2\u03c0c/\u03bba , and Is is the saturation intensity.

The response functions have been scaled to be equal at r = ld .\n\neffects in an atomic vapor. The physical effect leading to\nthe nonlinear optical response is the transfer of population from the ground to the excited state and the creation\nof coherence between these states. Although motional effects are accounted for as regards the Doppler smearing\nof the transition frequency, atomic motion also results\nin transport of excited atoms which leads to a nonlocal\nresponse. The degree of nonlocality depends on the characteristic length scales associated with the transport of\nexcited state atoms. The first length scale is the mean\nfree path atoms travel before\na Rb-Rb collision occurs.\n\u221a\nThis is given by lc = ( 2na \u03c3)\u22121 , where \u03c3 is the collisional cross section. For collisions of ground state Rb\natoms we use [16] \u03c3g\u2212g = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u221217 m2 . The cross\nsection for collisions between excited and ground state\ncollisions is much larger since these collisions occur via\na long range dipole-dipole interaction [17]. The energy\n\u221214\n\u221a\naveraged cross section is \u03c3g\u2212e \u223c 1.8\u00d710\nK1/2 m2 . The\nT\nsecond length scale is ld = \u1e7d\u03c4 , which is the distance\ntraveled\np by an atom moving at the most probable speed\n\u1e7d = 2kB T /m in the 1/e lifetime \u03c4 of the excited state.\nFor the 87 Rb 5P3/2 level \u03c4 \u2243 26 ns. Figure 1 shows that\nfor T < 155\u25e6 C the ballistic transport length for excited\n(g\u2212e) (g\u2212g)\natoms is ld \u223c 7.5 \u03bcm and ld < lc\n, lc\n. Thus for\nthese temperatures transport of excited atoms is ballistic with a length scale of ld . We note that the density\nat T = 155\u25e6C is na = 1020 m\u22123 which is several orders\nof magnitude smaller than densities for which nonlocal\neffects due to the Lorentz local field are important[18].\nWe wish to find an expression for the nonlocal material\nresponse that depends on the parameters \u03c4 and \u1e7d. We\nwrite the total atomic density na = ng + ne as the sum of\n\n(3a)\n(3b)\n\nwhere Lg , Le are, as yet unknown, linear operators for\nground and excited state atoms and \u03b1(I) = k[\u03c7\u2032\u20320 +\u03c7\u2032\u2032nl (I)]\nis the absorption coefficient. If we assume that the total\ndensity is unchanged by the presence of the laser field\n(this is a reasonable assumption in hot vapors, but not\nfor cold atoms) we must have Lg [ng ] = \u2212Le [ne ]. If excited state transport were a diffusive process we would\nhave Le [ne ] = De \u22072 ne and on dimensional grounds\nDe \u223c (v\u0304\u03c4 )2 /\u03c4 \u223c l2d /\u03c4.\nThe situation in the ballistic regime is different. The\ncollisionless Boltzmann equation for the density of ex\u2202ne\ne\ncited atoms is dn\ndt = \u2202t + v * \u2207r ne . Working within\nthe paraxial approximation we are interested in the twodimensional problem where r = xx\u0302 + y \u0177 and v =\nvx x\u0302 + vy \u0177. The Green function is found by solving\n\u2202ne\n+ v * \u2207r ne = \u03b4(t)n0 (r, v).\n\u2202t\n\n(4)\n\nThe time dependent solution of (4) is ne (r, v, t) =\nH(t)n0 (r \u2212 vt, v) where dH/dt = \u03b4(t). Now consider\nthe solution for n0 (r, v) = \u03b4(r0 )f (v), with f (v) =\n2\n2\n(m/2\u03c0kB T )e\u2212v /\u1e7d the two-dimensional thermal velocity distribution.

We can account for this by including a\nfactor of e\u2212\u03b3t in the Green function to arrive at\n1 e\u2212\u03b3(t\u2212t0 ) \u2212|r\u2212r0 |2 /(\u1e7d2 (t\u2212t0 )2 )\ne\n.\n\u03c0\u03b3 2 l2d (t \u2212 t0 )2\n(7)\nThe Green function is parameterized by the decay rate\n\u03b3.

The result is plotted in the inset of\nFig. 1 as a function of the scaled coordinate r/ld . We\nsee, not unexpectedly, that the ballistic response falls off\nmuch\nmore rapidly than the diffusive response. Note that\nR\ndr G(r, 0, \u03b3) = 1/\u03b3, since the time integrated response\nexponentially weights the input over a time window \u03c4 =\n1/\u03b3.

The imaginary part\nof the nonlinear susceptibility is proportional to the differential density of excited and ground state atoms which\ndecays with rate \u03b3. When the intensity is uniform in\nspace the susceptibility satisfies the relaxation equation\nd\u03c7\u2032\u2032nl /dt = \u2212\u03b3(\u03c7\u2032\u2032nl \u2212 \u03c7\u2032\u2032nl ) where the overbar denotes the\nsteady state value of the susceptibility. When I is spatially varying we can use the Green function to write the\nstationary response as\nZ\n\u2032\u2032\n\u03c7nl (r) = \u03b3\u03c70 dr0 G(r, r0 ; \u03b3)\n(\n)\nIm[Z(a + ibI [I(r0 )])]\np\n\u00d7\n\u2212 Im[Z(a + ib)] .

The Green function to be used for\n\u03c7\u2032nl is thus G(r, r0 , \u03b3/2) and we can write\n\nZ\n\u03b3\u03c70\ndr0 G(r, r0 ; \u03b3/2)\n=\n2\n\u00d7 {Re[Z(a + ibI [I(r0 )])] \u2212 Re[Z(a + ib)]} .

They constitute a full description of time-independent wave propagation in a two-level\natomic vapor including Doppler broadening and transport induced nonlocality.\nThe question of whether or not the ballistic transport\nis sufficient to stabilize nonlinear modes can be investigated by beam propagation calculations.

We\nused this set throughout all the simulations presented in\nthis paper. In the conservative system (\u03c7\u2032\u20320 = \u03c7\u2032\u2032nl = 0)\nall modes we tried (ground state, single charged vortex,\ndipole, double charged\nvortex) turned out to be stable if\nR\nthe power P = I(r)dr, is high enough. At least for the\nlatter two modes this is quite remarkable, since they are\nknown to be unstable (or only stable in a small power\nwindow) for other nonlocal models [8, 19, 20]. We attribute this enhanced stabilization to the combination of\nnonlocality and nonlinear saturation. In fact, we inserted\nan artificial nonlinear saturation in the nonlocal thermal\nmodel used in Ref. [19] and found that the double charged\nvortex becomes stable as well. However, it is worth pointing out that nonlinear saturation without nonlocality does\nnot stabilize higher order nonlinear modes [21]. The local\nEqs. (1,2) feature a stable ground state only.\nFigure 2 illustrates both saturation and nonlocality for\nthe nonlocal single charged vortex mode. If we consider\nonly the saturation effect shown in Fig. 2(a) the resulting nonlinear index is the dashed blue line in Fig. 2(b).\nTogether with the nonlocal kernel G [red line in Fig. 1\ninset] we get the solid blue line, showing some filling in\nof the central dip in the index profile, and the formation\nof a broader \"nonlocal waveguide\".\nThe limiting mechanism with respect to long distance\npropagation of higher order nonlocal nonlinear modes is\nnot destabilization but dissipation. The action of both \u03c7\u2032\u20320\nand \u03c7\u2032\u2032nl is not negligible over one diffraction length zd =\n2kl2d [22]. As an illustrative example, the propagation\nof the nonlocal single charged vortex mode, is shown in\nFig. 3(a). As input power we use about 0.4 W. Note\nthe clearly visible influence of the nonlinear term \u03c7nl in\nthe blue power curve. The nonlocal vortex survives a\npropagation distance of more than 150zd [see Fig. 3(b)].\nFor comparison, the propagation of the local vortex with\nthe same input power is shown in dashed lines in Fig.\n\n\f4\na generic nonlocal nonlinearity which can stabilize the\npropagation of vortices and other higher order modes in\na self-focusing medium. For sufficiently high power we\nfound a stable dipole mode and single and double charged\nvortices. In realistic models dissipation is not negligible.\nNevertheless, numerical experiments demonstrate robust\npropagation over a hundred or more diffraction lengths.\nThis is possible due to adiabatic conversion into solitons\nwith lower power, but of the same family.\nNumerical simulations were performed on the SGI Altix 3700 Bx2 cluster of the Australian Partnership for Advanced Computing and on the IBM p690 cluster (JUMP)\nof the Forschungs-Zentrum in J\u00fclich, Germany.\n\n\u2217\n\n[1]\nFIG. 3: (color online) (a) Nonlocal (solid lines) and local\n(dashed lines) dissipative propagation of the single charged\nvortex mode with input power 0.4 W.

(f) Same for the\nnonlocal double charged vortex at z = 0 and at z = 100zd .\n\n3(a). This vortex disintegrates after less than 15zd [see\nFig. 3(d)]. Hence, we clearly see that the stabilization is\ndue to nonlocality. With the same input power of about\n0.4 W, we also observed a robust nonlocal dipole [see Fig.\n3(e)] and double charged vortex [see Fig. 3(f)].\nThe key feature enabling robust nonlocal dissipative\npropagation over a hundred diffraction lengths is the\nabove mentioned stability for high powers. Starting in\nthe stable power regime, dissipation makes the nonlinear mode \"glide down\" the family branch until it reaches\npowers in the unstable regime. Figure 3(c) confirms this\nproperty by comparing maximal intensity and FWHM\nobtained upon propagation with values found from exact numerical solution of the conservative problem using\nthe method described in [8]. The solid lines are obtained\nupon propagation, which explains the small oscillations\nin the curves.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that ballistic transport\nof optically excited atoms in a thermal vapor provides\n\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n\n[6]\n[7]\n\n[8]\n[9]\n\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n\n[21]\n\nPresent address: D\u00e9partement de Physique Th\u00e9orique et\nAppliqu\u00e9e, CEA/DIF, B.P. 12, 91680 Bruy\u00e8res-le-Ch\u00e2tel,\nFrance; Electronic address: stefan.skupin@cea.fr\nN.
