Fariborz\nDepartment of Mathematics/Physics\nState University of New York Institute of Technology\nUtica, NY 13504-3050, U.S.A.\n\nAbstract\nThe highlights of studies of mixing among scalar mesons below and above\n1 GeV within a nonlinear chiral Lagrangian framework is briefly presented.\nTwo scalar meson nonets are introduced to explore the mass spectrum and\ndecay properties of the I=1/2 and I=1 scalar states. For the I=0 states, in\naddition to these two nonets a scalar glueball component is also taken into\naccount, and together with the constraints from the I=1/2 and I=1 sectors,\ntheir mass spectrum is studied. The fact that an ideally mixed qq scalar nonet\nhas a mass ordering which is opposite to that of an ideally mixed four-quark\nscalar nonet is exploited to gain some insight into the quark substructure\nof the I=1/2, I=1 and I=0 states below and above 1 GeV. Consequently,\nnumerical estimates of various components of these states (two quark and\nfour quark components of I=1/2 and I=1 states, and two quark, four quark\nand glue component of I=0 states) are determined.\nScalar states below and above 1 GeV are shown in Fig. 1, and are all\nlisted/discussed in PDG [1]. Not all of these states are well-established:\nAmong these the f0 (600) [or \u03c3] and the f0 (1370) have large uncertainties on\ntheir mass and decay widths, as well as the K0\u2217 (800) [or \u03ba] which has been\nparticularly under a special scrutiny and debate. It is now generally believed\nthat the states below 1 GeV are something other than pure qq states, as\nopposed to those above 1 GeV which have been the favored candidates for\na qq nonet, even though some of their properties do not quite follow a qq\nassignment. Possible solutions for the status of the lowest-lying scalar states\ninclude the MIT bag model, KK molecule and unitarized quark model, as\nwell as many recent investigations (see [2] for a selection of refs.). There are\nreasons to investigate the mixing between the scalar mesons below and above\n1 GeV. First, intuitively this is not inconceivable as some of these states [such\nas f0 (600) and f0 (1370) as well as K0\u2217 (800)] are broad and their masses spread\n1\n\n\fAmir H. Fariborz\n\nScalar Mesons Mixing and Substructure\n\nover a wide range, therefore one may expect that some of their properties may\noverlap. Second, the available experimental data may already be pointing\nto such mixings. For example, a close look at some of the properties of the\na0 (1450) and K0\u2217 (1430) [which are expected to be two members of the same\nqq scalar meson nonet (see PDG [1])] shows surprising deviations from a qq\nnonet properties. Clearly, their masses are rather puzzling [1]: If these two\nstates belong to the same qq nonet, then why should a0 (1450) (which does\nnot contain a strange quark) be heavier than K0\u2217 (1430) (which does contain a\nstrange quark)? There are also decay properties of these states that cannot be\nunderstood based on a pure qq picture. As a possible solution, a description\nof the I = 1/2 and I = 1 scalar states below and above 1 GeV in terms of\ntwo nonets of scalars and within a nonlinear chiral Lagrangian framework was\nexplored in ref. [3]. In that work, it was shown that if an underlying \"bare\"\nfour-quark nonet N lies beneath an underlying \"bare\" two-quark nonet N \u2032 ,\nthen as a result of mixing of N and N \u2032 we can easily understand why a0 (1450)\nbecomes heavier than K0\u2217 (1430) (in addition, the decay properties of these\nstates can be understood in this scenario). Fig. 1 shows how this mechanism\nworks. It was also found in [3] that the I = 1 states are close to equal\nadmixtures of two and four-quark states, whereas the I = 1/2 states are less\nmixed, with K0\u2217 (800) containing close to 75% four-quak and 25% two-quark\n[and vice versa for K0\u2217 (1430)]. What does this scenario say about the I = 0\nstates? This question was studied in [4] in which the implications of such\nunderlying mixing of nonets N and N \u2032 on the I = 0 states was investigated.\nFig. 1 summarizes the results and shows how the I = 0 states originate from\nthe four-quark nonet N, two-quark nonet N \u2032 and a scalar glueball G. The\nmass part of the Lagrangian for N, N \u2032 and G is (in the leading order of\nmixing):\nLmass = \u2212aTr(NN) \u2212 bTr(NNM) \u2212 a\u2032 Tr(N \u2032 N \u2032 ) \u2212 b\u2032 Tr(N \u2032 N \u2032 M)\n\u2212cTr(N)Tr(N) \u2212 dTr(N)Tr(NM) \u2212 c\u2032 Tr(N \u2032 )Tr(N \u2032 ) \u2212 d\u2032 Tr(N \u2032 )Tr(N \u2032 M)\n\u2212\u03b3Tr (NN \u2032 ) \u2212 \u03c1Tr(N)Tr(N \u2032 ) \u2212 gG2 \u2212 eGTr (N) \u2212 f GTr (N \u2032 )\n(1)\nin which M is the usual quark mass spurion. The mass of the I = 1/2 and\nI = 1 states involve terms a, b, a\u2032 , b\u2032 and \u03b3 only. The mass of I = 0 states\ninvolve all 13 parameters. The mixing of I = 0 states is clearly much more\ncomplicated and amounts to 5\u00d75 rotation matrices among N, N \u2032 and G. The\nresult of the numerical analysis of [4] for the prediction of the substructure\nof the I = 0 states are given in Fig. 2, in which, in the middle, the dashed\nlines represent nonet N (that has a mass ordering consistent with an ideally mixed four-quark nonet), the solid lines represent nonet N \u2032 (that has a\nmass ordering consistent with an ideally mixed two-quark nonet) and the box\n2\n\n\fAmir H. Fariborz\n\nScalar Mesons Mixing and Substructure\n\nrepresents the scalar glueball predicted in this model. Identifying the components of the two bare nonets with the corresponding members of an ideally\nmixed four-quark nonet and ideally mixed two-quark nonet results in conclusion that the bare masses in nonet N\n\u221a \u0003 to top): m(udud)\n\u0002 are (from bottom\n= 0.83 GeV, m(dsud) = 1.06 GeV, m (sdds + suus)/ 2 = 1.24 GeV; and\n\u221a \u0003\n\u0002\nthe bare masses in nonet N \u2032 are (from bottom to top): m (uu + dd)/ 2 =\n1.24 GeV, m(us) = 1.31 GeV and m(ss) = 1.38 GeV. The uncertainty of the\nglueball mass (shown by the height of the box, approximately between 1.5\nGeV to 1.7 GeV) is due to the uncertainty of the input masses of f0 (600) and\nf0 (1370). In Fig. 1, on the right, the I = 0 physical states are shown, and\nthe height of the two boxes represent the prediction of the present model for\nthe uncertainties of the masses of f0 (600) and f0 (1370), which are (in this\nmodel) approximately in ranges 0.4 \u2212 0.7 GeV and 1.3 \u2212 1.45 GeV, respectively. On the left, the I = 1/2 and I = 1 physical states are shown [note\nthe level-crossing that explains the properties of a0 (1450) and K0\u2217 (1430)].\nThe arrows show the dominant component of each physical state. Finally,\nthe detailed numerical analysis of [4] predicts the substructure of the I = 0\nscalars (in terms of two quark, four quark and glueball components) which\nare given in Fig. 2.\n\nGeV\n1.8\n111111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000000\n\n1.6\n1.4\n\na 0(1450)\n\nG\n111111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000000\n\nK*(1430)\n0\n\nN'\n\n1.2\n1.0\n\nN\n\na 0(980)\n0.8 K*(800)\n0\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\nf 0 (1710)\nf 0 (1500)\nf0 (1370)\nf 0 (980)\n\nf 0 (600)\nI=1/2 states &\nI=1 states\n\nUnderlying\n\"bare\" states\n\nI=0 states\n\nFigure 1: Prediction of the present model for the substructure of the I = 1/2,\nI = 1 scalar states below 2 GeV (left) and for the I = 0 scalar states below\n2 GeV (right) in terms of the underlying \"bare\" states (middle).\n\n3\n\n\fAmir H.
