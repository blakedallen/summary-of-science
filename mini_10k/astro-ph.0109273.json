This is the phenomenon of back-reaction. Famous\nexamples include the response of QED to a homogeneous electric field [1]\nand the response of generic matter theories to the gravitational field of a\nblack hole [2]. In the former case, virtual e+ e\u2212 pairs can acquire the energy\nneeded to become real by tunneling up and down the field lines. The newly\ncreated pairs are also accelerated in the electric field, which gives a current\nthat reduces the original electric field. The event horizon of a black hole\nalso causes particle creation when one member of a virtual pair passes out of\ncausal contact with the other by entering the event horizon. As the resultant\nHawking radiation carries away the black hole's mass, the surface gravity\nrises.\nParker [3] was the first to realize that the expansion of spacetime can\nlead to the production of massless, minimally coupled scalars. Grishchuk [4]\nlater showed that the same mechanism applies to gravitons. Production of\nthese particles is especially efficient during inflation because virtual infrared\npairs become trapped in the Hubble flow and are ripped apart from one\nanother. Since the mechanism requires both effective masslessness on the\nscale of inflation and the absence of conformal invariance, it is limited to\ngravitons and to light, minimally coupled scalars.\nOur special interest is the back-reaction from this process. We believe\nthat the gravitational attraction between virtual infrared gravitons gradually\nbuilds up a restoring force that impedes further inflation. This mechanism\noffers the dazzling prospect of simultaneously resolving the (old) problem\nof the cosmological constant and providing a natural model of inflation in\nwhich there is no scalar inflaton [5]. The idea is that the actual cosmological\nconstant is not small and that this is what caused inflation during the early\nuniverse. Back-reaction plays the crucial role of ending inflation.\nThe purpose of this paper is to establish that there is a significant backreaction. This might appear obvious in view of the limitless extent of particle\ncreation otherwise. It is easy to show that about one infrared pair emerges\nper Hubble time in each Hubble volume. Denying that there is significant\nback-reaction implies that an observer can watch this go on in the space\naround him for an arbitrarily long period without feeling any effect.\n1\n\n\fHowever, the preponderance of expert opinion is highly doubtful about\nthe existence of a significant back-reaction. Some are concerned with the\nmethodology of previous studies of back-reaction. In the pure gravity model\ndescribed above, the expectation value of the gauge-fixed metric was computed in the presence of a state which is free graviton vacuum at t = 0, and\nthe resulting invariant element was reported in co-moving coordinates,\nh\u03a9 |g\u03bc\u03bd (t, ~x)dx\u03bc dx\u03bd | \u03a9i = \u2212dt2 + e2b(t) d~x * d~x .\n\n(1)\n\nWhen two loop effects are included the expansion rate is,\n(\n\nG\u039b\n\u1e03(t) = H 1 \u2212\n3\u03c0\n\u0012\n\n\u00132 \u0014\n\n1\n(Ht)2 + O(Ht) + O(G3)\n6\n\u0015\n\n)\n\n,\n\n(2)\nq\n\nwhere G is Newton's constant, \u039b is the cosmological constant and H \u2261 \u039b/3\nis the Hubble constant of the locally de Sitter background [6]. Unruh has\ncriticized the procedure of taking the expectation value of the metric first and\nthen forming it into an invariant measure of the expansion rate [7]. Linde has\nno objection to gauge fixing but he believes that expectation values obscure\nimportant stochastic effects [8].\nThere are also concerns about the putative physical mechanism behind\nscreening. Some doubt the causality of gravitational interactions between\nparticles which have been pulled out of causal contact with one another.\nOthers concede the reality of such a residual interaction but maintain that it\nmust be redshifted into insignificance by the inflationary expansion of spacetime. Finally, there are those who insist that back-reaction must degenerate\nto a small increase in the expansion rate because the time and space average stress-energy tensor induced by inflationary particle creation is that of a\nsmall, positive cosmological constant.\nOur response to plausible methodological concerns is cooptation. We\nbelieve that a physical process such a back-reaction will manifest itself in\nany reasonable formalism. To address Unruh's objection we form the metric\noperator into an invariant measure of the local expansion rate before taking\nits expectation value [9]. To address Linde's objection we set the formalism\nup so that stochastic samples of this expansion operator can be taken instead\nof expectation values [10].\nThese changes are too complicated to be implement in the pure gravity\nmodel but they can be carried out in a scalar analog which possesses the\n2\n\n\fsame combination of attractive self-interactions between massless, conformally noninvariant quanta. The model is essentially a massless, minimally\ncoupled scalar with quartic self-interaction,\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n1\nL = \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6g \u03bc\u03bd \u2212g \u2212 \u03bb\u03c64 \u2212g\n2\n4!\n+ counterterms + ordering corrections ,\n(3)\nin a locally de Sitter background. To make this system more similar to\ngravity we remove tadpole graphs through a procedure of covariant normal\nordering that preserves conservation of the stress-energy tensor. When this\nis done one can apply the same formalism which was used for pure gravity\nto show that the expansion rate is slowed by an amount which eventually\nbecomes non-perturbatively strong [11],\n)\ni\n\u03bb2 G\u039b h\n4\n3 3\n3\n2\n\u1e03(t) = H 1 \u2212 7 4 5 (Ht) + O(H t ) + O(\u03bb , G ) .\n23\u03c0\n(\n\n(4)\n\nWe shall demonstrate that this result is not changed by using an invariant\noperator al\u00e1 Unruh, and that it is superimposed upon an indeterminate effect\nof order \u03bb when one takes stochastic samples al\u00e1 Linde.\nSection 2 addresses the various non-methodological objections (causality,\nredshift, and modeling the source as a homogeneous, classical fluid). Section\n3 motivates our decision to order the scalar analog theory so as to subtract\noff tadpoles. Section 4 explains the actual procedure for accomplishing this.\nIn Section 5 we show that the expectation value of the invariant expansion\noperator agrees exactly with (4). We also argue that, while a stochastic\nsample can show an effect of either sign at order \u03bb, there is no significant\nchange in the order \u03bb2 result. Our conclusions comprise Section 6.\n\n2\n\nPhysics of inflationary back-reaction\n\nThe purpose of this section is to review the physics of inflationary backreaction so as to answer the three non-methodological objections which were\nsummarized before. We shall also give a simple explanation of why backreaction induces an ever-increasing, negative vacuum energy in perturbation\ntheory. The aim here is not rigor - that is supplied by the detailed calculations of Section 5. We seek rather to explain in simple terms why the\ncalculations turn out as they do.\n3\n\n\fIt is worthwhile recalling that the inflationary production of gravitons\n(and light, minimally coupled scalars) is a straightforward consequence of\nthe Uncertainty Principle, the existence of a causal horizon during inflation,\nand the simultaneous masslessness and absence of conformal invariance of\nthe quanta being produced. The Uncertainty Principle requires all quantum\ndegrees of freedom to possess 0-point motion. In a quantum field theory this\nmeans that virtual quanta continuously emerge from the vacuum. Although\nthe fact of their emergence does not depend upon the background geometry,\nwhat happens to them subsequently does. In particular, if there is a causal\nhorizon then long wave length quanta emerge out of contact with one another and so can never recombine. For this to happen with an appreciable\namplitude the quanta must of course be massless on the scale of the horizon.\nThey must also be sensitive to the local geometry. For the conformally flat\nbackgrounds characteristic of long periods of inflation this implies that the\nquanta must not possess classical conformal invariance. That is why gravitons and light, minimally coupled scalars experience super-adiabatic amplification during inflation whereas vector gauge bosons, spin 1/2 fermions, and\nconformally coupled scalars do not.\nIn considering the gravitational back-reaction from inflationary particle\nproduction note first that there is no buildup of particle density because\nthe 3-volume expands as new particles are created so as to keep the density\nconstant. When a new pair is pulled out of the vacuum the one before it is, on\naverage, already in another Hubble volume. However, the gravitational field\nis another thing. The created particles are highly infrared (by the standards\nprevailing at the time) so they do not carry very much stress-energy, but they\ndo carry some. This must engender a gravitational field in the region between\nthem. Because gravity is attractive, this field must act to resist the Hubble\nflow. This is a very small effect because gravity is a weak interaction, even\non the scales usually proposed for inflation. The feature that permits it to\nbecome significant is the cumulative nature of the effect. Even after a newly\ncreated pair has been pulled into distinct Hubble volumes its gravitational\nfield must remain behind to add with those of subsequent pairs. If nothing\nelse supervenes to end inflation first the gravitational field must eventually\nbecome nonperturbatively strong.\nThere is little doubt that inflationary particle production goes on because it is the usual explanation for the primordial spectrum of cosmological\nperturbations [12, 13] whose imprint on the cosmic microwave background\n4\n\n\fhas been so clearly imaged by the latest balloon experiments [14]. Nor is\nthere any real doubt that some gravitational back-reaction accrues from the\nprocess, since the usual theory of structure formation holds that we live in\ncomplex structures resulting from the gravitational collapse of primordial\nfluctuations over the course of ten billion years. The real issues are, whether\nor not there is a gravitational response during inflation, whether or not this\nresponse grows with time, and whether or not the response slows inflation.\nThose who argue against any response at all base themselves on causality. The source for our process is virtual particles which rapidly fall out of\ncausal contact with one another. Therefore, how can they interact in any\nway? The flaw in this argument is the picture it implies of exchange forces\nbeing maintained by instantaneous interaction across some arbitrary surface\nof simultaneity. Were this correct an outside observer could not feel the gravitational attraction from a pebble after it had entered the event horizon (in\nsome arbitrary frame) of a black hole. In fact exchange forces are maintained\nby virtual quanta which propagate causally, and those which carry the gravitational force from an object falling into a black hole originate in the region\noutside the event horizon. The same is true of objects which fall out of causal\ncontact in an inflating universe: they continue to feel a gravitational force\nfrom one another that is carried in a completely causal manner from far back\nalong their past light cones. The process is depicted in Fig. 1.\nThree other points deserve mention in connection with the issue of causality. The first is that inflationary particle production would not occur at all\nbut for the causal horizon of an inflating universe. Far from being something we ignore, causality is at the heart of the effect. The second point is\nthat the explicit perturbative computations [6, 11] which support this picture were made using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism [15]. This method is\nmanifestly causal: interaction vertices from outside the past lightcone of the\nobservation point make no contribution. The final point is that the effects\nof causality are quite evident in the factors of Ht which appear in the result\n(2). They are present, in essence, because two interaction vertices are being\nintegrated over the volume of the past light cone (see Fig. 2.), each factor of\nwhich grows like Ht.\nThose who argue against the possibility of a secular response concede that\nparticles continue to attract one another after having fallen out of causal contact. But they maintain that the lines of force from this effect must be rapidly\nbe diluted owing to the inflationary expansion of spacetime. Therefore the\n5\n\n\ft\n\nA\n\nB\n\nPLCA\n\nB'\nx\n\nFigure 1: The worldlines of two freely falling particles A and B in co-moving\ncoordinates. The interaction A feels from B derives not from some arbitrary\nsurface of simultaneity but rather from the portion of its past light cone (B \u2032\nand below) in which B is visible.\ngravitational fields contributed from particles created early during inflation\nshould become weaker and weaker.

But gravity is not\nconformally invariant, and the gravitational response from early perturbations approaches a constant rather than redshifting to zero [16].

Consider an electromagnetic analog of\nthe particle creation process in which a homogeneous and temporally constant current density J i (t, ~x) = j\u03b4 i 3 is produced at each point in an inflating\nspacetime. In flat space this would engender a linearly growing electric field\nof the form, E i (t, ~x) = \u2212jt\u03b43i , whose interpretation would be the superposition over time of a constant electric displacement.\nThings work a little differently during inflation.

To\nsee this simply turn the current off at a certain time and watch the subsequent evolution\nof the electric field. Although it decays exponentially it is still nonzero, despite there being\nno current anywhere on the same surface of simultaneity.\n\n7\n\n\fAssuming no initial field the solution is,\n\u03c8(t) = \u2212je\u2212b(t)\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\n\n\u2032\n\ndt\u2032 e\u2212b(t )\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032 )\n\ndt\u2032\u2032 e2b(t\n\n\u2212j\n.\n2\u1e032 (t)\n\n\u223c\n\n(12)\n\nJust as in the analogous electrodynamic problem, the conformally coupled\nscalar approaches a constant during inflation because previous contributions\nto it are redshifted.\nWe can understand what happens when conformal invariance is absent\nby comparing the response to the same source from a massless, minimally\ncoupled scalar. Its Lagrangian is,\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\nLMMC = \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6g \u03bc\u03bd \u2212g \u2212 J\u03c6 \u2212g .\n2\n\n(13)\n\nThe same specializations as before reduce the equation of motion to,\n\u0011\n\u0010\u221a\nd \u0010 3b \u0011\n1\ne \u03c6\u0307 = j .\n\u221a \u2202\u03bc\n\u2212gg \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd \u03c6 = J \u2212\u2192 \u2212e\u22123b\n\u2212g\ndt\n\n(14)\n\nThe solution can again be expressed as a double integral, but now there is\nno outer redshift factor,\n\u03c6(t) = \u2212j\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\n\n\u2032\n\ndt\u2032 e\u22123b(t )\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032 )\n\ndt\u2032\u2032 e3b(t\n\n\u223c \u2212j\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\n\ndt\u2032\n\n1\n.\n\u1e03(t\u2032 )\n\n(15)\n\nDuring inflation \u1e03 is nearly constant, so \u03c6(t) \u223c \u2212jt/\u1e03. Hence we learn that\nlifting conformal invariance permits early sources to contribute on an equal\nfooting with late ones.\nThe scalar comparison we have just given was far from specious. It has\nlong been known that, dynamical gravitons in a homogeneous and isotropic\nbackground geometry obey the same linearized equation as massless, minimally coupled scalars [4]. It is also well known that a single perturbation of\nthe metric does not redshift away during inflation. Instead the (synchronous\ngauge) perturbed metric approaches the form [16, 17],\ng\u03bc\u03bd (t, ~x)dx\u03bc dx\u03bd \u2212\u2192 \u2212dt2 + e2b(t) \u03b3ij (~x)dxi dxj .\n\n(16)\n\nBoucher and Gibbons prove their \"cosmic baldness\" theorem by then arguing\nthat, since the temporally constant, spatial variation of \u03b3ij (~x) must fall off\n8\n\n\fabove a certain co-moving Fourier mode, any freely falling local observer is\neventually unable to sense it. This is true for one perturbation, but what\nhappens when there is a mechanism, such as the Uncertainty Principle, which\ngenerates perturbations with higher and higher co-moving wave numbers?\nThere is simply no escaping the fact that the amplitude of \u03b3ij will change\nmore and more, and that this change will be visible to local observers. Hence\nthe effect is not only real but also secular.\nThis brings us to the third objection of principle, that inflationary particle\nproduction should result in a small fractional increase in the expansion rate.\nThe basis of this argument is modeling the stress-energy of particle production as a homogeneous and isotropic classical fluid. If this were correct we\ncould compute the gravitational back-reaction using the homogeneous and\nisotropic Einstein equations,\n3\u1e032 (t) = 3H 2 + 8\u03c0G\u03c1(t) ,\n\u22122b\u0308(t) \u2212 3\u1e032 (t) = \u22123H 2 + 8\u03c0Gp(t) .\n\n(17)\n(18)\n\nIt is straightforward to show that locally de Sitter inflation at Hubble constant H results in an average energy density and pressure of \u03c1 = \u2212p =\nH4 /16\u03c0 2 per species of massless, minimally coupled scalar.3 Substituting\n\u1e03 = H and solving the resulting quadratic equation gives the following result\nfor the final expansion rate,\n\uf8eb\n\n3\u03c0 \uf8ed\nH2 =\n1\u2212\n2G\n\ns\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(\n\n4G 2 \uf8f8\nG\u039b\nG\u039b\nH = H2 1 +\n+2\n1\u2212\n3\u03c0\n9\u03c0\n9\u03c0\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n+ ...\n\n)\n\n.\n\n(19)\n\nThat something must be wrong with this argument becomes apparent\nfrom the evident fact that it requires the expansion rate to increase. In\nother words, before the steady state solution (19) is attained we must have\nb\u0308 = \u22124\u03c0G(\u03c1 + p) > 0. But this violates the weak energy condition! Such a\nthing can happen through quantum effects [19], but the physics is hopelessly\nwrong in this case. A collection of particles, even gravitons, should be a drag\non the expansion of spacetime, not a super-accelerant to it.\nCloser inspection reveals two flaws in the argument. First, it assumes\nthat the distribution of created particles is homogeneous and isotropic. This\ncan hardly be so when the density of these quanta is about one per Hubble\n3\n\nFor a detailed derivation of this old and well-known result, see Section 4 of [18].\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 2: Two loop contributions to the background geometry from gravitons.\nThe lefthand diagram is a negligible constant because the gravitons do not\ninteract in a correlated fashion. The righthand one slows expansion by a\nfractional amount which grows like (G\u039b)2 (Ht)2 because the gravitons are\ncorrelated when they interact.\nvolume. Gravitons move at the speed of light, and there must necessarily\nbe a direction associated with this motion. The one infrared graviton in any\nsingle Hubble volume cannot give rise to a stress-energy tensor which is even\napproximately isotropic. Pretending otherwise risks the same sort of mistake\nas using the zero average charge density to describe the dielectric properties\nof a ponderable medium which actually consists of an enormous number of\npositive and negative charges.\nThe second flaw is ignoring quantum correlations. Fig. 2 presents two\ndiagrams that contribute to the quantum gravitational back-reaction on an\ninflating universe. Each has two loops and contributes at order (G\u039b)2 . Yet\nthe diagram on the left gives a constant that can be absorbed into renormalizing the cosmological constant4 whereas the one on the right contributes\nto the secular slowing of the Hubble constant in expression (2) [6]. The key\ndistinction between the two graphs is that the virtual gravitons on the right\nare correlated when they interact whereas the ones on the left are not.\nIt is easy to understand why correlation can make so much difference.\nConsider the traveling wave pulses depicted in Fig. 3. If the stretched string\nupon which they move is exactly linear then the packets pass through one\n4\n\nIn fact it must be so absorbed in order for the initial condition of inflation with Hubble\nconstant H to be satisfied.\n\n10\n\n\fFigure 3: A simple illustration of how correlation can change an interaction.\nThe wave packets on the top have the same sign, so were there a fourth order\ncoupling they would repel one another. The wave packets on the bottom have\nopposite signs. With the same coupling they attract one another.\nanother with no effect, however we can imagine that there is a nonlinear\ninteraction whose contribution to the potential energy of the string goes\nlike the fourth power of the displacement. Then it is clear that pulses of\nthe same sign and amplitude A repel one another because the superposed\namplitude of 2A gives a potential energy of +16A4 , which is larger than the\n2A4 when they are far apart. On the other hand, pulses with the opposite sign\nattract because their amplitude together is zero, which means zero potential\nas compared with the same 2A4 when far apart. Pulses of the opposite sign\nare a reasonable way (with classical string!) of representing particle-antiparticle pairs. Ignoring their affinity for one another - which is what using\nthe average stress-energy does - is a terrible approximation. It doesn't even\nget the sign right!\nIn considering the effects of anisotropies and correlations it is important\nto distinguish between the bare stress-energy of created gravitons - just the\nh\u0304\u03c9 per particle - and the stress-energy they develop through gravitational\ninteraction with one another. The former is highly anisotropic and also\nhighly correlated, which is why one doesn't even get the right sign by using\nits average value to compute the gravitational interaction energy. What the\nvarious elements of such a source must actually do is to attract one another,\nwhereas a precisely homogeneous and isotropic source causes spacetime to\nexpand. However, the gravitational interaction at any point is the result of\nsuperposing the gravitational fields of all pairs that have been created in the\npast light cone of that point. There are no significant quantum correlations\n11\n\n\fbetween different pairs, and their individual anisotropies tend to average out\nover a long period of inflation. So it should be valid to infer the effect on\ninflation by using (17-18), provided it is the energy density and pressure\nof gravitational interaction that are substituted, and provided that these\nquantities are not themselves computed by using the average of the bare\nstress-energy in the homogeneous and isotropic Einstein equations.\nOf course the correct way of inferring the stress-energy of gravitational\ninteraction is from the operator equations of quantum general relativity, and\nprecisely that was done to obtain (2) [6]. However, we can understand the\nresult by simply forcing the average bare energy density of created particles\nto attract itself as we know that the actual, anisotropic and quantum correlated source does. Much of the essential physics can even be captured using\nNewtonian gravity to estimate the interaction energy, provided the pressure\nis assumed to follow from conservation.\nConsider locally de Sitter inflation on a manifold whose spatial section is\na 3-torus. If the physical radius of the universe is initially H \u22121 then its value\nat co-moving time t is,\nr(t) \u223c H \u22121 eHt .\n(20)\nAs mentioned before, the average of the bare energy density of inflationally\nproduced infrared gravitons is,\n\u03c1IR \u223c H 4 .\n\n(21)\n\nThis is insignificant compared with the energy density in the cosmological\nconstant (\u223c H 2 /G), and \u03c1IR is in any case positive. However, the gravitational interaction energy is negative, and it can be enormous if there is\ncontact between a large enough fraction of the total mass of infrared gravitons,\nM(t) \u223c r 3 (t)\u03c1IR \u223c He3Ht .\n(22)\nFor example, if M(t) was all in contact with itself the Newtonian interaction\nenergy would be,\nGM 2 (t)\n\u2212\n\u223c \u2212GH 3 e5Ht ,\n(23)\nr(t)\nDividing by the 3-volume gives a density of about \u2212GH 6 e2Ht , which rapidly\nbecomes enormous.\n\n12\n\n\fOf course this ignores causality. Most of the infrared gravitons needed to\nmaintain \u03c1IR are produced out of causal contact with one another in different\nHubble volumes. The ones in gravitational interaction are those produced\nwithin the same Hubble volume. Since the number of Hubble volumes grows\nlike e3Ht , the rate at which mass is produced within a single Hubble volume\nis,\ndM1\n\u223c H2 .\n(24)\ndt\nAlthough most of the newly produced gravitons soon leave the Hubble volume, their gravitational potentials must remain, just as an outside observer\ncontinues to feel the gravity of particles that fall into a black hole. The rate\nat which the Newtonian potential accumulates is therefore,\nd\u03a61\nG dM1\n\u223c \u2212 \u22121\n\u223c \u2212GH 3 .\ndt\nH\ndt\n\n(25)\n\nHence the Newtonian gravitational interaction energy density is,\n\u03c1(t) \u223c \u03c1IR \u03a61 (t) \u223c \u2212GH 6 Ht \u223c \u2212(GH 2 )2 * Ht *\n\nH2\n.\nG\n\n(26)\n\nAlthough this model is very crude it does act in the right sense - to\nslow inflation - and it is secular. The dependence upon coupling constants\nis also correct - (G\u039b)2 , characteristic of a 2-loop process like the quantum\ngravitational result (2). This can be understood from the fact that one must\ngo to one loop order to see particle production, whereas the interactions\nbetween these particles - which is the source of the effect - requires another\norder in perturbation theory.\nOne other thing that this model gets right is the equation of state, if we\nalso assume the relativistic form of stress-energy conservation. When the\nnumber of e-foldings Ht becomes large, the fractional rate of change of the\ngravitational interaction energy is negligible compared with the expansion\nrate,\n|\u03c1\u0307(t)| \u226a H|\u03c1(t)| .\n(27)\nIt follows from energy conservation,\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03c1\u0307(t) = \u22123H \u03c1(t) + p(t) ,\n13\n\n(28)\n\n\fthat the induced pressure must be nearly opposite to the energy density. In\nother words, back-reaction induces negative vacuum energy. Since the key\nrequirement is slow accumulation in the sense of relation (27), the equation\nof state is really a consequence of the fact that gravity is a weak interaction\non the scale of inflation.\nBefore closing the section we should also comment that one does not require a complete solution of quantum gravity in order to study an infrared\nprocess such as this. As long as spurious time dependence is not injected\nthrough the ultraviolet regularization, the late time back-reaction is dominated by ultraviolet finite, nonlocal terms whose form is entirely controlled\nby the low energy limiting theory. This theory must be general relativity,\n\u221a\n1\n(29)\nL=\n(R \u2212 2\u039b) \u2212g ,\n16\u03c0G\nwith the possible addition\nq of some light scalars. Here \"light\" means massless\nwith respect to H \u2261 \u039b/3. No other quanta can contribute effectively in\nthis regime.\nIt is worth commenting that infrared phenomena can always be studied\nusing the low energy effective theory. This is why Bloch and Nordsieck\n[20] were able to resolve the infrared problem of QED before the theory's\nrenormalizability was suspected. It is also why Weinberg [21] was able to\nachieve a similar resolution for \u039b = 0 quantum general relativity. And it is\nwhy Feinberg and Sucher [22] were able to compute the long range force due\nto neutrino exchange using Fermi theory. More recently Donoghue [23] has\nbeen working along the same lines for \u039b = 0 quantum gravity.\n\n3\n\nProblems with coincident propagators\n\nAs discussed in the previous section, the effect we seek to study has two\nessential features. The first is that infrared virtual particles are continually\nbeing ripped out of the vacuum and pulled apart by the inflationary expansion of spacetime. The second crucial feature is that these particles attract\none another through a weak long range force which gradually accumulates\nas more and more particles are created. The particles we believe were actually responsible for stopping inflation are gravitons, and the long range force\nthrough which they did it was gravitation. However, this is not a simple theoretical setting in which to work. It took over a year of labor to obtain the\n14\n\n\ftwo loop result (2) - even with computer symbolic manipulation programs\n[6]. Before attempting to extend this feat to include invariant observables or\nstochastic samples one naturally wonders whether there is not some simpler\ntheory we could study which manifests the same effect.\nAs also explained in the previous section, the prerequisites for inflationary\nparticle production are masslessness on the scale of inflation and the absence\nof classical conformal invariance. Massless, minimally coupled scalars have\nthese properties - and the lowest order back-reaction from self-interacting\nscalars can be worked out on a blackboard in about 15 minutes [11]. Of\ncourse it is not natural for scalars to possess attractive self-interactions and\nstill remain massless on the scale of inflation. But we do not need a realistic\nmodel - that is already provided by gravitation. What we seek is rather a\nsimple model that can be tuned to show the same physics, however contrived\nand unnatural this tuning may be.\nThe behavior of free, massless and minimally coupled scalars in a locally\nde Sitter background has been much studied [24, 25, 26, 27]. Among the\ncurious properties of these particles are the absence of any normalizable, de\nSitter invariant states [24] and the appearance of acausal infrared singularities\nwhen the Bunch-Davies vacuum is used with infinite 3-surfaces [25, 26]. The\nfeature that concerns us here is the assertion that taking the coincidence\nlimit of the propagator gives an ultraviolet divergent constant plus a finite\nterm which grows linearly with the co-moving time [27],\nH2\ni\u2206(x; x) = UV + 2 Ht .\n4\u03c0\n\n(30)\n\nAlthough this may not be an observable statement for free scalars we shall\nargue in this section that it has three disturbing consequences for our program\nof adding a \u03bb\u03c64 self-interaction to obtain a paradigm for infrared quantum\ngravity:\n1. The linear growth derives from the ultraviolet, not the infrared;\n2. Scalars develop a linearly growing mass at order \u03bb; and, worst,\n3. The stress-energy violates the weak energy condition at order \u03bb.\nThe purpose of this section is to demonstrate these problems. We will explain\nhow to correct them in the next section.\n15\n\n\fWe begin by giving the Lagrangian.

The ones on the second line are of order \u03bb2 and will not\nconcern us further here.\nWe are not quantizing gravity. The metric is a non-dynamical background\nwhich we take to be locally de Sitter in conformal coordinates,\ng\u03bc\u03bd (\u03b7, ~x) = \u03a92 (\u03b7)\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd\n\n,\n\n\u03a9(\u03b7) = \u2212\n\n1\n= eHt .\nH\u03b7\n\n(33)\n\n(Recall that \u039b = 3H 2 .)

We release the state in Bunch-Davies\nvacuum at t = 0, corresponding to conformal time \u03b7 = \u2212H \u22121 . Note that the\ninfinite future corresponds to \u03b7 \u2192 0\u2212 , so the possible variation of conformal\ncoordinates in either space or time is at most \u2206x = \u2206\u03b7 = H \u22121 .\nBecause the spatial manifold is compact, wave numbers have the form,\n~k = 2\u03c0H~n, where ~n is a vector of integers.

The terrifically undesirable feature about this is\nthat the result can change when one changes the ultraviolet structure of the\ntheory, which is precisely the sector of quantum gravity we do not know.\nTo see the second problem we compute the one loop scalar self masssquared.

They\nare given in Figures 5-7. The dominant contribution comes from the diagrams in Fig. 5.

Inflation actually speeds up. In fact there is a trivial interpretation for what is\nhappening: the Uncertainty Principle causes the scalar to wander from its\nclassical value of \u03c6 = 0, and that engenders a positive potential energy. It is\nthis scalar potential energy that increases the expansion rate.\nOf course the diagrams of Fig. 5 are not the only ones which contribute\nto the stress-energy tensor. Although the others cannot change the (Ht)2\nterms, they do add important structure to enforce stress-energy conservation\nand cancel the ultraviolet divergences.5 Hence our leading order results for\nthe induced energy density (T00 \u2261 \u2212\u03c1g00 ) and pressure (Tij \u2261 pgij ),\no\n\u03bb H 4n\n(Ht)2 + O(Ht) + O(\u03bb2 ) ,\n\u03c1 =\n8 2\u03c0\n\u0012\n\u0013\no\n\u03bb H 4n\np = \u2212\n(Ht)2 + O(Ht) + O(\u03bb2) ,\n8 2\u03c0\n\u0012\n\n5\n\n\u0013\n\n(47)\n(48)\n\nOf particular interest is the conformal counterterm given in the first diagram of Fig. 7.\nIn a locally de Sitter background there is no distinction between R and the constant, 12H 2 .\nHowever, the distinction does matter in computing the stress-energy tensor and one must\nuse the conformal counterterm to cancel overlapping divergences which come from the\ndiagrams of Fig. 6.\n\n19\n\n\fD\n\nD\n\nV\n\nM\n\nFigure 6: Contributions to the scalar stress-energy tensor at order \u03bb which\ninvolve the derivative vertex D without normal ordering.

This establishes the third and final problem\nwith coincident propagators: they result in a violation of the weak energy\ncondition at order \u03bb.\n\n4\n\nCovariant normal ordering\n\nWe would like to have a theory in which the ultraviolet does not contaminate\nthe infrared, in which massless particles remain massless, and in which matter\nis a drag on expansion rather than a super-accelerant.

We call the method, covariant normal ordering. For simplicity we shall\ngive the result for the original Lagrangian, without its counterterms. Their\ninclusion is straightforward.\nIn what follows we assume that the theory has been regulated invariantly\nso that the coincident propagator is a finite scalar functional of the metric.\nWe define the normal-ordered product of \u03c6N as follows,\n[N/2]\nN\n\n: \u03c6 (x) : \u2261\n\nX\n\nk=0\n\n(2k \u2212 1)!!N!\n(\u2212i\u2206(x; x))k \u03c6N \u22122k (x) .\n(2k)!(N \u2212 2k)!\n\n(50)\n\nNote that one can differentiate either with respect to the field or the coincident propagator,\n\u2202 : \u03c6N :\n= N : \u03c6N \u22121 :\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n,\n\n\u2202 : \u03c6N :\nN(N \u2212 1)\n=\n: \u03c6N \u22122 : .\n\u2202(\u2212i\u2206)\n2\n\n(51)\n\nThe trick behind covariant normal-ordering is to implement it at the level of\nthe Lagrangian through the replacement: L \u2212\u2192: L :. In this way all objects\nderived from the action - such as the scalar stress-energy tensor and the\nscalar field equations - are free of tadpoles.\n21\n\n\fStress-energy conservation is maintained by taking account of the implicit\nmetric dependence of the propagator. One can infer this, formally, from the\nfunctional integral representation,\n%\n&\n\ni\ni\u2206(y; y ) = [d\u03c6]\u03c6(y)\u03c6(y ) exp \u2212\n2\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0014\n\nZ\n\n4\n\nd x\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6g\n\n\u03bc\u03bd \u221a\n\n\u0015\n\n\u2212g .\n\n(52)\n\nHence the variation which gives the stress-energy tensor produces,\n1\n\u03b4i\u2206(y; y \u2032)\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u2212\n=\ni\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\ng\u03bc\u03bd (x)g \u03b1\u03b2 (x)\n(\u03bc\n\u03bd)\n\u03bc\u03bd (x)\n\u03b4g\n2\n\u2212g(x)\n\nq\n\n\u22122\n\u00d7\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\u2202 \u2202\n{i\u2206(x; x\u2032 )i\u2206(y; y \u2032) + 2i\u2206(x; y)i\u2206(x\u2032 ; y \u2032 )}x\u2032 =x .\n\u03b1\n\u2032\u03b2\n\u2202x \u2202x\n\n(53)\n\nHowever, we shall modify this scheme in two ways, one necessary and the\nother highly convenient. The convenient modification is that we can drop\nthe first of the three terms in (53) because it is separately conserved.\nThe necessary modification is that one really varies the Schwinger functional integral [29] to obtain the stress-energy tensor. This contains + fields\nwhich evolve the theory forward and \u2212 fields which evolve it back to the\ninitial state. Although there is no mixing between these fields, both are minimally coupled to the same metric. Hence the stress-energy tensor receives\ncontributions from both terms. This is necessary to make the stress-energy\ntensor real and to make it depend causally upon quantities in the past lightcone of the point x\u03bc at which it is evaluated.

Including the counterterms\nis straightforward but irrelevant because the first contributions to \u03b4m2 , \u03b4\u03be,\n\u03b4Z and \u03b4\u03bb are of order \u03bb2 . Since the additional terms in the stress-energy\noperator consist of these O(\u03bb2) constants times normal-ordered products of\nthe fields, the lowest correction to the stress-energy tensor from all except\nthe \u03b4\u039b counterterm are of order \u03bb3 . This cannot affect the order \u03bb2 effect we\nshall compute in the next section.\nCovariant normal-ordering cannot be fundamental because it results in a\nstress-energy tensor that depends nonlocally (but causally) upon the fields.\nHowever, it does seem to be acceptable if all we seek is a method for tuning\na simple, scalar model to make it roughly agree with what goes on in the\nvastly more complicated system of quantum general relativity. In particular,\nthe model's stability should be enhanced, not endangered, by eliminating the\ntendency of quantum fluctuations to produce super-acceleration at the lowest\norder in perturbation theory. It is also relevant to note that the technique\nreduces to ordinary normal-ordering in the flat space limit.\n\n5\n\nBack-reaction\n\nThe purpose of this section is to demonstrate that the scalar model defined\nby covariant normal-ordering shows real back-reaction at the lowest order in\n23\n\n\fD\n\nV\nV\n\nV\n\nV\nFigure 8: Contributions to the scalar stress-energy tensor at order \u03bb2 with\ncovariant normal ordering.

This result is then used\nto compute the expectation value of the invariant expansion operator which\nwas defined in a previous paper [9]. The conclusion is that back-reaction\nslows inflation by an amount which eventually becomes nonperturbatively\nstrong. All orders bounds are given for the strength of the effect. Finally,\nwe argue that significant back-reaction would show up as well if stochastic\nsamples, rather than expectation values, had been used.\nWith covariant normal-ordering the expectation value of the stress-energy\ntensor is much simpler than without. Because there are no coincident propagators the lowest contribution comes at order \u03bb2 from the two diagrams in\nFig. 8 [11]. (Of course there is a cosmological counterterm to absorb the\nultraviolet divergence.) Further, the derivatives on the top vertex of the\nrighthand diagram render its contribution subdominant to the lefthand diagram in powers of Ht. So the dominant contribution to the expectation\nvalue of the stress-energy tensor is \u2212g\u03bc\u03bd (x) times,\nE\n\u03bbD\n\u03a9 : \u03c64 (x) : \u03a9 =\n4!\nZ\no\nn\n\u2212i\u03bb2\n4\n4\nd4 x\u2032 \u03a94 (\u03b7 \u2032) [i\u2206++ (x; x\u2032 )] \u2212 [i\u2206+\u2212 (x; x\u2032 )] + O(\u03bb3 ) . (58)\n4! t\u2032 >0\n\nThe difference of ++ and +\u2212 propagators comes from using the Schwinger24\n\n\fKeldysh formalism [15, 29] to compute an expectation value rather than\nan in-out amplitude. This form ensures that the result is real and that it\ndepends only upon points x\u2032\u03bc in the past lightcone of the observation point\nx\u03bc . The lower limit of temporal integration at \u03b7 \u2032 = \u2212H \u22121 (that is, t\u2032 = 0)\nderives from the fact that we release the state in free Bunch-Davies vacuum\nat this instant.\nAlthough (58) was computed in ref. [11] we will go over it in detail. Since\nonly the logarithm term of the propagator breaks conformal invariance it is\nperhaps not surprising that the dominant secular effect comes from taking\nthis term in each of the four propagators.

First, there is nothing paradoxical about the\nnegative sign of the (Ht)4 contribution to expectation value of a positive\noperator. The actual result is dominated by a positive ultraviolet divergent\nconstant. It is only after the cosmological counterterm is used to subtract\nthis divergence that the ultraviolet finite factor of (Ht)4 dominates the late\ntime behavior of the scalar stress-energy tensor at order \u03bb2 .\nOur second comment is that the negative sign of the (Ht)4 term has a\nsimple physical interpretation. As the inflationary expansion rips more and\nmore scalars out of the vacuum their attractive self-interaction acts to pull\nthem back together. This is the direct analog of the graviton effect we have\nbeen seeking.\nOur final comment is that the full stress-energy, including the bare cosmological constant, obeys the weak energy condition. Our leading order result\nimplies,\no\n9\n\u03bb2 n\n\u03c1(t)\n4\n3 3\n=\n\u2212\n(Ht)\n+\nO(H\nt\n)\n+ O(\u03bb3 ) ,\nH4\n8\u03c0G\u039b 29 32 \u03c0 6\no\np(t)\n9\n\u03bb2 n\n4\n3 3\n(Ht)\n+\nO(H\nt\n)\n+ O(\u03bb3) .\n=\n\u2212\n+\n4\n9\n2\n6\nH\n8\u03c0G\u039b 2 3 \u03c0\n\n(65)\n(66)\n\nSince G\u039b \u226a 1, the sign of the total energy density is positive, even though\nthe scalar contribution is negative. (At least for as long as perturbation\ntheory remains valid.) From conservation we see that the sum of the energy\ndensity and the pressure is positive,\n\u2212\u03c1\u0307(t)\n\u03bb2 H 4\n\u03c1(t) + p(t) =\n= 9 2 6\n3H\n23\u03c0\n\n\u001a\n\n4\n(Ht)3 + O(H 2t2 ) + O(\u03bb3 ) .\n3\n\u001b\n\n(67)\n\nThis is the sense in which matter ought to act, so we conclude that covariant\nnormal-ordering has succeeded in making scalars behave analogously to the\nvastly more complicated graviton model.\nWe have so far been working in a locally de Sitter geometry. To quantify the back-reaction on inflation we must instead regard de Sitter as the\nbackground upon which perturbative corrections are superimposed,\ng\u03bc\u03bd (x) \u2261 \u03a92 (\u03b7) [\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + \u03ba\u03c8\u03bc\u03bd (x)]\n26\n\n,\n\n\u03a9(\u03b7) \u2261\n\n\u22121\n.\nH\u03b7\n\n(68)\n\n\fHere \u03ba2 \u2261 16\u03c0G. The pseudo-graviton field, \u03c8\u03bc\u03bd (x), is determined, up to a\ndiffeomorphism, by solving the Einstein equations,\n1\n(69)\nR\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 Rg\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\u039bg\u03bc\u03bd + 8\u03c0GT\u03bc\u03bd [g, \u03c6] .\n2\nNote that this need not entail quantizing gravity. It is perfectly consistent to\nsuppress dynamical graviton degrees of freedom so that the pseudo-graviton\nfield is only an operator through its dependence upon \u03c6, and this is what we\nshall do. One consequence is that \u03ba\u03c8\u03bc\u03bd receives its first nonzero contributions\nat order G. If these result in a secular reduction of the expansion rate - as\nwe will see that they do - then we can establish that back-reaction is real\nwithout needing to consider either higher G corrections to \u03ba\u03c8\u03bc\u03bd or the effect\nof more than a single power of the pseudo-graviton field in the expansion\noperator.\nFor the purpose of quantifying back-reaction in this system it suffices\nto use the simplest of the invariant observables previously constructed for\nthat purpose [9]. We first define a scalar measure of the expansion rate and\nthen evaluate it on a geometrically fixed observation point. Our scalar is the\ninverse conformal d'Alembertian acting upon a unit source,\n1\n1 (x) ,\n\u2737c\n= A0 (x) + \u03baA1 (x) + O(\u03ba2 \u03c8 2 ) .\n\nA[g](x) \u2261\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(70)\n(71)\n\nThe zeroth order term can be evaluated exactly, although we shall make the\nslow roll approximation (denoted by an arrow),\nA0 (x)\n\n1 1 3\n\u03a9 ,\n\u03a9 \u22022\n\n\u2261\n\n\u2212\n\n=\n\n\u2212eHt\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n0\n\n(72)\n\u2032\n\ndt\u2032 e\u2212Ht\n\nZ\n\nt\u2032\n\n0\n\u0011\n\u2212Ht 2\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\ndt\u2032\u2032 e2Ht ,\n\n(73)\n\n1 \u0010\n1\u2212e\n,\n(74)\n2H 2\n1\n(75)\n\u2212\u2192 \u2212 2 .\n2H\nBecause this is constant, no perturbative shift in the observation point can\naffect the first order result!

Back-reaction is for real.\n28\n\n\fAlthough we will not compute them here, it is straightforward to estimate\nthe strength of higher order effects. Consider a diagram with 2N external\nscalar lines. At L loop order the number of \u03c64 interaction vertices is,\nV = L+N \u22121 .\n\n(82)\n\nEach contributes a factor of \u03bb, so the diagram goes like \u03bbL+N \u22121 . The number\nof internal propagators is,\nP = 2L + N \u2212 2 .\n\n(83)\n\nThe largest secular effect comes, as it did for (64), from the term where\neach propagator contributes its logarithm part. Since we are computing a\nSchwinger diagram, there will be V cancellations between + and \u2212 variations,\nwhich give the \u03b8-function imaginary part of the logarithm. However, there\nare also V temporal integrations, each one of which can potentially result in\nan extra factor of ln(\u2212H\u03b7) = \u2212Ht. Hence the strongest possible effect for\nthe 2N-point vertex at L loop order is,\nL\nV2N\n\u223c \u03bbL+N \u22121 (Ht)2L+N \u22122 .\n\n(84)\n\nThe stress-energy tensor corresponds to N = 0 so the dominant contribution at L loop order is,\n\u0010\n\nL\nT\u03bc\u03bd\n\u223c g\u03bc\u03bd H 4 \u03bb(Ht)2\n\n\u0011L\u22121\n\n.\n\n(85)\n\n\u221a\nIt follows that perturbation theory breaks down at Ht \u223c 1/ \u03bb. Since \u03bb\nis assumed small we see that back-reaction can be studied reliably for an\nenormous number of e-foldings. Note that all the higher point diagrams\nremain perturbatively weak during this entire period,\nlim\n\nHt\u2192\u03bb\u22121/2\n\nL\nV2N\n\u223c \u03bbN/2 .\n\n(86)\n\nIt \u221a\nshould therefore be valid to use perturbation theory almost up to Ht =\n1/ \u03bb.\nFinally, we consider the effect of taking stochastic samples of A[g](x)\nrather than computing its expectation value. A procedure for implementing\nthis perturbatively was worked out in ref. [10]. What one does is to solve\n29\n\n\fthe scalar field equations (57) for \u03c6(x) in terms of its initial value and that of\nits first derivative, organized as creation and annihilation operators on free\nBunch-Davies vacuum,\n\u03c6(x) = \u03c6I (x) +\n\n\u03bb\n6\n\nZ\n\nt\u2032 >0\n\nd4 x\u2032 Gret (x; x\u2032 ) : \u03c63I (x\u2032 ) : +O(\u03bb2 ) .\n\n(87)\n\nThe free field \u03c6I (x) was given in expression (34), and the retarded Green's\nfunction is,\n\u03b8(\u2206\u03b7)\nGret (x; x ) = \u2212\n4\u03c0\n\u2032\n\n(\n\n\u03b4(\u2206\u03b7 \u2212 \u2206x)\n+ H 2 \u03b8(\u2206\u03b7 \u2212 \u2206x)\n\u03a9(\u03b7)\u03a9(\u03b7 \u2032 )\u2206x\n\n)\n\n.\n\n(88)\n\nThe order G result for the expansion observable comes from substituting\nthis solution into (79) and then assigning random C-number values to those\ncreation and annihilation operators in \u03c6I (x) which have experienced horizon\ncrossing by the observation time.\nSince the dominant contribution to the stress-energy tensor is from the\nquartic coupling we can make the replacement,\n\u03baA1 (x) \u2212\u2192 \u2212\n\n\u03bbG\n: \u03c64 (x) : .\n4\n18H\n\n(89)\n\nThe order \u03bb contribution to this operator is obtained by replacing all the fields\n\u03c6(x) by the free field \u03c6I (x). Although this term has zero expectation value\non account of covariant normal-ordering, a stochastic sample will generally\nbe nonzero. We can compute its variance by taking the expectation value of\nits square,\n\u001c\n\u001d\n\u0010\n\n\u03a9 : \u03c64I (x) :\n\n\u00112\n\n\u03a9 = 24[i\u2206(x; x)]4 .\n\n(90)\n\nSince i\u2206(x; x) grows like H 2 /4\u03c0 2 Ht, we see that the order \u03bb contributions\nto \u03baA1 (x) fluctuate about zero with standard deviation,\n\u03c3\u03baA1\n\n1\n=\n2H 2\n\n(\n\ni\n\u03bbG\u039b h\n2\n(Ht)\n+\nO(Ht)\n+ O(\u03bb2, G2 )\n2\n2.5\n3\n23 \u03c0\n\n)\n\n.\n\n(91)\n\nFor some samples the fluctuation reduces the expansion rate from its classical\nvalue, for other samples the expansion rate is increased.\nIt is important to realize that this order \u03bb effect is the same as the one\npreviously studied on the nonperturbative level by Linde and collaborators\n30\n\n\f[8]. Although its variance does have the stated temporal dependence, what\nan actual observer sees is the effect of the field executing a drunkard's walk.\nHence the time dependence of the order \u03bb contribution to a stochastic sample\nof A[g](x) is not simple.\nThe order \u03bb2 effect we saw from the expectation value derives from the\nterm where three of the fields in : \u03c64 : are the free field \u03c6I and the other field\nis the order \u03bb correction in (87). The nonlocal character of this term tends\nto wash out its variance [10], so stochastic samples of it are clustered tightly\naround the mean value (80). We conclude that stochastic samples of the\nexpansion operator consist of the same secular slowing term we found in its\nexpectation value, superimposed upon a genuinely stochastic, random walk\nat order \u03bb. Since there is only a small probability for the drunkard's walk\nto exhibit monotonic time dependence, it is possible to distinguish the two\neffects, even if a fluctuation happens to make the order \u03bb contribution larger.\nTherefore, back-reaction is still real in the presence of stochastic effects.\n\n6\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this paper we have employed a simple scalar model to demonstrate that\nthere can be significant back-reaction on inflation, even when the effect is\nquantified using an invariant operator measure of the expansion rate and\neven when stochastic effects are included. The expectation value of the invariant expansion operator gives precisely the same result that was previously\ninferred by computing the expectation value of the gauge-fixed metric [11].\nThe situation is more complicated when stochastic effects are included. The\nresult in this case is that almost the same secular slowing is superimposed\nupon the perturbative analog of the stochastic effect previously studied by\nLinde and collaborators [8]. In both cases back-reaction slows inflation by\nan amount which eventually becomes nonperturbatively strong.\nThe scalar model is somewhat contrived in two ways.\nq First, the scalar's\nnatural mass is not zero but rather the scale of inflation, HMpl . Second, the\ncovariant normal-ordering prescription of Section 4 results in a subdominant\ncontribution to the stress-energy tensor (56) which depends causally but\nnonlocally upon the scalar and metric fields. This term plays no role at the\norder we worked, but it is necessary to enforce conservation at higher orders.\nNeither of these features should cast doubt upon the reality of back-reaction\n31\n\n\fin quantum gravity. In fact they were imposed upon the scalar model to\nmake it more nearly resemble gravity.\nIn Section 2 we have also tried to answer the three objections of principle sometimes made to a significant back-reaction: causality, redshift, and\naveraging the source. To briefly recapitulate, the gravitational attraction between superhorizon particle pairs derives from virtual gravitons which were\nemitted in the past, before each particle exited its partner's causal horizon.\nThe same mechanism is responsible for the persistence of gravitational fields\ndue to massive objects which have fallen inside the event horizon of a black\nhole. Although electromagnetic fields are redshifted by inflation, gravitational potentials are not. This derives from the fact that electromagnetism is\nconformally invariant whereas gravity is not. On a concrete level one can see\nit from the theta function term in the retarded Green's function (88) which\nis common to minimally coupled scalars and dynamical gravitons. Finally,\nit is not valid to compute back-reaction from the average stress-energy of\nproduced particles because this suppresses the quantum correlation between\nproduced pairs and because the actual distribution of particles is not uniform. Clumps of energy density attract one another gravitationally whereas\nthe perfectly uniform distribution which results from taking the spatial average simply increases the overall expansion rate.\nA spinoff of our work is the order \u03bb violation (49) of the weak energy\ncondition when the scalar model is not covariantly normal-ordered. This\nseems to be an analog, on cosmological scales, of quantum violations of the\nenergy conditions which have been previously studied on much smaller scales\n[19]. With observations on the current state of the universe not disfavoring\nan equation of state with w < \u22121 [30] it is worth taking note of models that\ncan achieve this.\nAcknowledgments\nWe have profited from conversations on this subject with R.
