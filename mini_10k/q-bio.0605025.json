Ecologists use\nmodels to synthesize existing system knowledge into a concise form that\nguides empirical research programs (Osidele and Beck, 2004; Whipple et al.,\n2005), but they also use statistical models to describe patterns in their data\n(Underwood, 1997), and simulation models both to explain and predict system\nbehavior (Clark et al., 2001; Ford, 2000; J\u00f8rgensen and Bendoricchio, 2001;\nMelillo et al., 1993). Models also let scientists perform thought experiments\nthat would not otherwise be possible or ethical. Because of this advantage,\necologists have used models to build ecological theory (Abrams, 1993, 2000;\nCarpenter et al., 1985; J\u00f8rgensen, 2002; Pulliam and Danielson, 1991) and\nto guide environmental assessment and management (Brando et al., 2004;\nCostanza and Ruth, 1998; J\u00f8rgensen, 1994; Korfmacher, 2001; Maguire, 2003;\nReckhow, 1994; Sage et al., 2003).\nQuantitative models in ecology and environmental science are often categorized by the degree to which their structure corresponds to a real system\n(Bossel, 1992; Hilborn and Mangel, 1997; Levins, 1966, 1993; Orzack and Sober,\n1993; Reckhow, 1994; Zeigler, 1974). This realism continuum begins with empirical models and ends with mechanisms. Empirical models (e.g., regressionbased models) stem solely from observed relationships among variables, provide a statistical summary of the data, and ignore mechanisms determining\nthe behavior. In contrast, mechanistic models contain unobserved relationships, explain system dynamics, and emphasize the physical, chemical, and\nbiological processes that generate system behavior. Ecologists use mechanistic\nmodels to understand how system behavior may change in response to changing environmental conditions. A central problem of building models with more\nrealistic structures is determining which entities and processes to include and\nwhich mathematical representation is most appropriate.\nFollowing Langley et al. (1987), we claim that model construction involves\nsearch through a space of possible models for ones that fit system observations. This space contains alternative model structures (entities, processes\nand the connections among them), mathematical formulations, and parameter values. The immense number of possible models challenges scientists, who\nnavigate this space by selecting the set of objects or entities used to represent the system and the relationships that link these objects to each other\nand their environment. When establishing the entities, scientists must address\nthree questions: (1) which entities should be included, (2) how detailed should\nthey be, 3) and how should they be represented? The answers determine object aggregations and system boundaries, both of which are rarely obvious\nand can significantly influence model results (Abarca-Arenas and Ulanowicz,\n2\n\n\f2002; Ahl and Allen, 1996; Cale and Odell, 1979; Gardner et al., 1982; Loehle,\n1987a; Rastetter et al., 1992). After defining the objects, the scientist can state\ntheir relationships by deciding which ones to include and how to model them.\nThis task requires the specification of each relationship's mathematical formulation, which often involves selection from several possibilities. For example,\nthe Lotka\u2013Volterra, Ivlev, or Holling Type III functions each model predation,\nbut the different formulations make different claims about how the process operates. Finally, the scientist must set the numeric parameters. In some cases,\nempirical estimates of parameter values exist, but more often the values are\nlargely unknown (Beck, 1987; Reckhow, 1994). Uncertainty enters the model\nat each decision point (Beck, 1987; J\u00f8rgensen and Bendoricchio, 2001; Loehle,\n1987a; Reckhow, 1994; Reynolds and Ford, 1999), complicating the search for\nplausible explanations.\nSearching for models presents two additional challenges, one related to the\nselection criteria and the other centered on the search procedure. Scientists\nrequire criteria for ranking and evaluating models (Hilborn and Mangel, 1997;\nJost and Arditi, 2001; Oreskes, 1998; Oreskes et al., 1994; Reynolds and Ford,\n1999), which usually include one or more quantitative measures of goodness-offit of the predictions to observed data. However, selecting a model based on its\naccuracy alone is insufficient since very different models can generate similar\nbehavior (Cale et al., 1989). To overcome this problem, additional criteria such\nas a model's complexity, uncertainty and generality may be used. If the model\nshould explain system behavior, then its structure must also be sufficiently\nrealistic (Bossel, 1992; Levins, 1966; Zeigler, 1974). The second challenge is\nthat the search procedure is cumbersome. In ecology, this search is typically a\nmanual effort guided by an expert's domain knowledge (e.g., aquatic ecosystems) and modeling experience, along with the data. Given a model structure\nand mathematical formulation, some methodologies assist with fitting parameters and quantifying parameter uncertainty (e.g., Hornberger and Spear, 1980;\nOsidele and Beck, 2004; Saltelli et al., 2000; Spear and Hornberger, 1980). Nevertheless, search through the space of model structures, mathematical formulations, and parameter values remains a challenging and time-consuming chore.\nIn this paper we describe a method for representing and building models designed to:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nfacilitate construction of process-based models;\nexpedite search through the space of candidate model structures;\nroot model development in domain theory; and\nbind models to empirical observations.\n\nWe first describe a new formalism for representing models as interacting sets\nof entities and processes. We claim that this formalism captures how scientists\nunderstand complex system dynamics, and therefore eases model communica3\n\n\ftion. This representation also simplifies the comparison of a model's structure\nto the relevant domain theory. We then show how this formalism facilitates\nsearch through the space of plausible model structures and illustrate the use\nof this approach by re-representing an existing model of the Ross Sea. Finally,\nwe discuss related work and propose some directions for future research.\n\n2\n\nProcess Modeling\n\nIn this section, we introduce the method for representing and constructing\nexplanatory models. The approach has two core elements: entities, which are\nthe objects or actors in the system, and processes, which are the actions or\nactivities of the entities that generate system dynamics. Abstract forms of\nprocesses and entities encode domain knowledge, which is then used to construct models with realistic structure. Scientists combine instantiated versions\nof the abstract elements to construct models of specific systems. We conclude\nthis section by briefly describing software we are developing to support this\nmodeling approach.\n\n2.1 Entities\n\nIn process models, entities are actors and receivers of action that are characterized by a combination of variables and parameters. For example, in a soil\necosystem model the collection of nematodes could be an entity with variables\nthat describe its total carbon concentration and the number of individual organisms. Depending on the model objectives and the processes included, a\nvariety of parameters associated with the nematodes may be of interest including their maximum intrinsic growth rate, carrying capacity, and death\nrate.\nIn ecological models, entities are rarely differentiated from variables, which\nworks well when there is only one state variable for each entity. In such cases,\necologists commonly associate parameters with an entity by using the state\nvariable's name as a subscript (see Section 3 for an example). However, making\nentities explicit provides a natural way to group variables and parameters and\nmore closely resembles how scientists think about real systems.\nTo make entities explicit in the process modeling representation, a scientist\nspecifies a set of generic entity types, each of which defines the properties of a\nclass of objects. Multiple instantiated versions of these generic entities can be\nincluded in a model. For example, an ecologist could create a generic entity for\nbirds, and then instantiate it as a sparrow or a hawk by changing the values\n4\n\n\fTable 1\nThe syntax for defining a generic entity type.\nentity name\ndescription \"description\"a\nvariables\nvariable name1 {combining scheme}b , \"description\"\nvariable name2 {combining scheme}, \"description\"\nparameters\nparameter name1 [range]c , \"description\"\nparameter name2 [range], \"description\"\na Descriptions\n\ncan be any text.\nschemes state how the effects of multiple processes operating on a variables will be aggregated.\nc Parameter ranges delineate legal values, which are determined from mathematical constraints, domain\ntheory, and empirical observations.\nb Combining\n\nof class properties.\nTodorovski et al. (2005) report an initial formalism for specifying entities in\nprocess models that we build upon here in Table 1. The formal generic entity\nhas a name and a set of properties. Entities may contain both variables and\nparameters, where variables change in the context of the model and parameters\ndo not. Variables must have a name and a rule that determines how the effects\nof multiple processes are aggregated (e.g., summed, multiplied). Parameters\nmust have a name and an interval that delineates their possible values. For\nboth variables and parameters, there is an optional slot to provide a brief\ndescription. In instantiated entities the variables are either associated with\ndata or given initial values, the parameter values are assigned real values, and\na field following the name indicates the parent generic entity.\nTo use an entity in a model, we need a notation that allows access to its fields.\nWe have chosen a dot notation that concatenates the variable or parameter\nname with the entity name. For example, to refer to the chlorophyll a concentration (chla) of an instantiated phytoplankton entity (P haeocystis), we\nwrite chla.P haeocystis.\n\n2.2 Processes\n\nProcesses are the physical, chemical, or biological actions that drive change\nin dynamic models. For example, growth is a biological process that occurs in\nmany ecological models, whereas oxidation\u2013reduction, photolysis, and sorption are examples of chemical and physical processes from biogeochemistry.\nThe process modeling framework employs two forms of processes: generic and\ninstantiated. Table 2 shows the syntax for generic processes, which define the\n5\n\n\fTable 2\nThe syntax for defining a generic process.\ngeneric process name\nrelates role1 {entity type, entity type}a\nrole2 {entity type, entity type}\nparameters <set of process specific parameters>\nequations <set of differential and algebraic equations>b\nconditions <set of boolean conditions>c\na Each\n\nrole may be played by multiple objects instantiated from different generic entities.\ndescribe the effects of the process on the entities.\nc Conditions control when the process is active.\nb Equations\n\nbasic properties of a class of processes. Generic processes must include a name,\na statement of which generic entities or entity types can be involved, and a set\nof equations. The relates statement identifies unique entity roles in the process\nand the entity types that can fill those roles. A generic process can also include\na set of Boolean conditions that control whether the process is inactive. For\nexample, we could set the conditions so that the variable light must be positive for the photosyntheses process to occur (light.environment > 0). Such\nstatements turn processes on and off, making the model structurally dynamic.\nThe set of generic processes are collected with the generic entities into one\nlibrary.\nThe second form of process is the instantiated version of a generic process,\nwhich is bound to specific entities and has specific values for parameters.\nEach instantiated process has a specific name and instantiated entities fill\nthe roles in the equations. The process naming scheme first identifies the\nprocess and then the entities the process affects. For example, we might\nname an exponential growth process that operates on a phytoplankton entity 'exp growth phyto'.\nTable 3 illustrates the difference between instantiated and generic processes.\nBoth representations refer to an exponential death process. The generic process specifies two roles that entities play in this process. The first role, played\nby the organism that dies, can be filled by either the phytoplankton or zooplankton entity types. The equations indicate that these types must contain\na variable called conc and a parameter named dr. The second role can only\nbe filled by the detritus entity type, which must also have a conc variable.\nIn the instantiated process, the name of the instantiated entity replaces the\nrole name in the equations. Thus, the first role was filled by a phytoplankton\nentity named P haeocystis, whereas the second role was filled by the detritus\nentity named Detritus.\nA key distinction of this representation is that elements of the model equations\n6\n\n\fTable 3\nAn example of a generic process for exponential death and an instantiated version\nof the process.\nGeneric Process\ngeneric process death exponential\nrelates S1{phytoplankton, zooplankton}, S2{detritus}\nequations d[conc.S1,t,1] = -1 * dr.S1 * conc.S1\nd[conc.S2,t,1] = dr.S1 * conc.S1\nInstantiated Process\nprocess death exponential Phaeo\nequations d[conc.P haeocystis,t,1] = -1 * dr.P haeocystis * conc.P haeocystis\nd[conc.Detritus,t,1] = dr.P haeocystis * conc.P haeocystis\n\nthat pertain to a process are grouped together. This organization communicates how a process is formulated, what entities drive it, and how it affects\nparticular entities. This process centered association also facilitates the assembly of the system of equations for a model from these fragments.\n\n2.3 Modeling Procedure\nThe modeling procedure described here resembles the traditional recipe found\nin many texts on quantitative modeling (e.g., Gold, 1977; Grant et al., 1997;\nJ\u00f8rgensen and Bendoricchio, 2001), but it bears two distinctive features. First,\nthe procedure is organized as a search through a space of candidate models\nfor those that explain a set of empirical observations. Second, the method\nassembles candidate models from libraries of generic entities and processes. To\nimplement this approach, we must define the search space, describe a search\nmechanism, and specify criteria for selecting among alternative models. In\nthis paper we assume that the structural search is exhaustive, the parameter\nsearch is accomplished using existing algorithms such as gradient descent,\nand that the selection criteria include quantitative measures of goodness-of-fit\n(e.g., sum of squared errors, r 2 ) and the realism of the model structure. These\nassumptions allow us to focus our discussion on the search space.\nAs described in the introduction, the search space is determined by alternative\nmodel structures and sets of parameters. While this space can be quite large,\nour method of representing and developing models constrains it in two ways.\nFirst, a model's structure comprises entities linked by processes. The space\nof possible model structures is circumscribed by a domain-specific library of\ngeneric entities and processes thought to occur in the system, and specific\nentities to be related. The generic types dictate how instantiated processes and\nentities can be combined. Second, the entity types specify the possible ranges\n7\n\n\ffor each parameter, limiting the parameter space. The range defined in the\ngeneric entity may be wide if we have little knowledge about the appropriate\nvalues, but additional knowledge, such as empirical estimates, can support a\nnarrower range.\nIn the ideal case, one or more libraries of generic entities and processes will\nalready exist for the domain being investigated. In that case, the challenge\nis to select the most relevant library and adapt it as needed. For example, it\nwill be necessary to adapt a library when observations of the physical system\nsuggest alternative entity definitions, or when the modeling objective is to\ndetermine the significance of a conjectured new process.\nIf no appropriate library exists, then an investigator must construct one to\nsupport the modeling task. Although this requirement introduces an additional step to the modeling task, we believe that the advantages of using an\nexplicit library of entities and processes outweigh the cost of its construction. Specifically, the generic entities and processes define the search space.\nFrom the generic definitions, the library determines the possible entities and\nprocesses the model can include, their possible structural relationships, alternative mathematical formulations, and the parameter ranges. Further, to the\ndegree that the library reflects existing domain knowledge, it also determines\nthe space of theoretically plausible or realistic models. In addition, a key idea\nin this approach is that these libraries form a repository of domain knowledge\nor theory that can be reused for different modeling projects. We expect this to\nboth expedite the modeling process and constrain model structures to reflect\nexisting domain knowledge. At the very least, we expect it will ease review of\nthe domain theory and modeling assumptions used.\nGiven the space of plausible models, the investigator must search through it\nfor models that explain the empirical observations. This search has three steps:\n(1) bind entities to selected generic processes and combine these components\ninto a model structure;\n(2) use estimation routine to identify parameters that generate predictions\nthat best fit the observed variables; and\n(3) evaluate the resultant model's performance using a set of model selection\ncriteria.\nIn this way, multiple alternative models are constructed and evaluated. This\nmodel search can be implemented by hand, but the formalism also allows\nboth the structure and parameter search to be automated. Automatic model\ninduction is beyond the scope of this paper, but see George et al. (2003);\nLangley (2000); Langley et al. (2003, 2002, in press) for details on how this\ncan be accomplished.\n8\n\n\f2.4 Prometheus\nTo encourage the process modeling approach, we are developing a software\nenvironment called Prometheus that is designed to support model building\nfrom conceptual development to evaluation, use, and publication (S\u00e1nchez and Langley,\n2003). This program has six principal features. First, it provides an interactive\nway for a user to add and edit generic processes to a domain library. Second,\nit allows manual construction of instantiated models from a domain library\nin an interactive and graphic environment. For example, to add a process the\nuser selects a generic process from the library, which opens a dialogue box that\nguides the user through binding the entity roles and parameters in the generic\nprocess to specific entities in the model. The user can also specify the values\nof process level parameters in this dialogue. Given an instantiated model, a\nthird feature of the program is to assemble and simulate the model equations.\nThe user can then view the equations and graph the simulated trajectories.\nThe fourth feature is Prometheus' ability to automatically search through\ncandidate models derived from a library. The program returns a reduced set of\nthe models with trajectories that best match the observed data based on sum\nof squared errors. A fifth feature is the ability to automatically revise an existing model. Through an interactive dialogue, the user can ask Prometheus\nto add or delete whole processes, and to revise parameters within processes.\nAsgharbeygi et al. (2006) discuss this ability in more detail. The final feature\nis a graphical representation of the model structure in which entity variables\nare linked through processes. This representation of instantiated models provides another way for users to view and analyze their models (see Section 3.2.3\nfor more details on the model diagrams). Collectively, these features provide\na comprehensive toolbox for process modeling.\n\n3\n\nRoss Sea Ecosystem Model\n\nIn this section, we illustrate the process modeling approach with a version of\nthe Ross Sea ecosystem embedded in the Ross Sea Coupled Ice And Ocean\n(CIAO) model (Arrigo et al., 2003; Worthen and Arrigo, 2004). The original ecosystem model has six state variables, including P. antarctica (P1 ),\ndiatoms (P2 ), detritus (D), zooplankton (Z), nitrate (NO3 ) and iron (F e).\nIn CIAO, this ecosystem model is coupled to a modified version of the Princeton Oceanographic Model, which is a physical ocean model that predicts\nthe three dimensional structure of temperature, salinity, and velocity in response to both surface and lateral boundary conditions of heat, salt, and\nmomentum. Arrigo et al. (2003) used CIAO to investigate factors controlling\nphytoplankton production and taxonomic composition in the Ross Sea, and\nWorthen and Arrigo (2004) used it to explore the interannual variability of\n9\n\n\fprimary production. More recently, Tagliabue and Arrigo (2005) added more\ndetailed mechanisms for iron cycling, the carbonate system, and the air-sea\nCO2 exchange. They used this enhanced model to investigate the sensitivity\nof the ecosystem dynamics to changes in taxon-specific nutrient utilization parameters. They also explored the impact of differing iron fertilization regimes\non the ability of the system to sequester carbon (Arrigo and Tagliabue, 2005).\nIn addition, Asgharbeygi et al. (2006) employed a modified version of the\necosystem model to demonstrate the usefulness of new inductive tools for\nmodel revision.\nTo more clearly demonstrate the process modeling approach, we simplified\nthe Ross Sea ecosystem model in two ways. First, we extracted the ecosystem model from CIAO, and focused on activity near the ocean surface. In\nthis simplified model, there are three driving variables: daily mean photosynthetically usable radiation at the ocean surface (P URe ) and center (P URc )\nof the modeled volume and water temperature (TH2 O ). Second, we represent\nphytoplankton with one state-variable (P ) rather than two. The variables C,\nZ, and D represent the concentration of carbon in the three entities, and NO3\nand F e represent the concentration of nitrate and iron, respectively.\n\n3.1 Differential and Algebraic Equation Representation\n\nAs is common in ecological modeling, the original Ross Sea ecosystem model\nwas originally formulated as a set of ordinary differential and algebraic equations, which were implemented as a Fortran program. The modified differential\nequations for the five state-variables are\ndP\n= ((1 \u2212 eP )\u03bc \u2212 xP \u2212 \u03c9P )P \u2212 gZ,\ndt\ndZ\n= (\u03b3Z g \u2212 xZ \u2212 rZ )Z,\ndt\ndD\n= (1 \u2212 \u03b2)[(1 \u2212 \u03b3Z )gZ + xP P + xZ Z] \u2212 (rD + \u03c9D )D,\ndt\ndNO3\n= \u2212\u03c6(P,N/C) \u03bcP , and\ndt\ndF e\n= \u03c6(D,F e/C) rD D \u2212 \u03c6(P,F e/N ) \u03bcP.\ndt\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n\nIn equation 1, the balance between the rates of growth (\u03bc), death (xP ), exudation (eP ), grazing (g), and sinking (\u03c9P ) determine the change in phytoplankton concentration (P ). The product of the grazing rate (g), the zooplankton assimilation efficiency (\u03b3Z ), and the phytoplankton being grazed, as\n10\n\n\fwell as the zooplankton death (xZ ) and respiration (rZ ) rates determine the\nchanges in zooplankton (Z) abundance as shown in equation 2. Additions to\nthe detrital (D) pool, modeled in equation 3, include the particulate fractions\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2) of unassimilated grazing (i.e., fecal pellets) and dead phytoplankton\nand zooplankton. Losses are from remineralization (rD ) and sinking (\u03c9D ). Phytoplankton nitrate uptake is assumed to be proportional to the magnitude of\nphytoplankton growth (\u03bcP ), and determines the Nitrate (NO3 ) concentration\nas equation 4 illustrates. We then multiply this quantity by the phytoplankton nitrogen to carbon ratio (\u03c6(P,N/C) ). There are no significant nitrate inputs\nduring the growing season. In equation 5, iron concentration (F e) is a function\nof detrital remineralization (adjusted by the Fe/C ratio, \u03c6(D,F e/C) ) and phytoplankton production multiplied by the phytoplankton Fe/C ratio (\u03c6(P,F e/C)).\nPhytoplankton growth rate (\u03bc) and zooplankton grazing rate (g) are variables\nin this model. We formulated the phytoplankton growth rate as\n\u03bc = \u03bc0max * e(0.06933*TH2 O ) * min(ik lim, n lim, f e lim),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03bc0max is the maximum unlimited growth rate at 0\u25e6 C and TH2 O is the\nwater temperature. Light and nutrients limit growth as if they were substitutable resources. That is, only the minimum value of these resources retards\nthe maximum growth rate. We calculated light limitation (ik lim) as\nik lim = a \u2212 e(\u2212P U Rc /ik) * e(\u2212P U Rc /photoinhib)\n\u0010\n\n\u0010\n\nik = ikmax / a + 2.50 * e\n\nP U Re *e(1.089\u22121.12*log 10 (ikmax ))\n\n(7a)\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n\n(7b)\n\nwhere a is a fitting parameter, P URc and P URe are the mean daily photosythetically usable radiation (\u03bcmol photons m\u22122 s\u22121 ) in the center of the mixed\nocean layer and at the mixed layer edges, respectively, photoinhib represents\nthe negative impact of high light on phytoplankton growth, and ikmax is the\nupper limit of ik. Nitrate (n lim) and iron (f e lim) limitation are modeled\nwith Monod functions, giving\nNO3\nand\nNO3 + kN O3\nFe\n,\nf e lim =\nF e + kF e\nn lim =\n\n(8a)\n(8b)\n\nwhere kN O3 and kF e are the half-saturation constants for nitrate and iron,\nrespectively.\nGrazing assumes a Holling Type II relationship,\ngmax * \u03b7\n\u03b7 + gcap\n\u03b7 = P \u2212 (biomin + glim ),\ng=\n\n11\n\n(9a)\n(9b)\n\n\fwhere gmax is the maximum grazing rate of Z on P , gcap is the capture rate,\nand \u03b7 represents the phytoplankton concentration susceptible to grazing. Here,\nbiomin is a modeling measure to ensure that phytoplankton concentrations\nremain positive, and glim represents the biological limitation of zooplankton\ngrazing on phytoplankton.\nRepresenting the model as a system of differential and algebraic equations\nhas advantages, in that it clearly identifies the model variables and the full\nequations such that translating them into computer code for simulation would\nbe relatively trivial. The differential equations imply the entities Phytoplankton, Zooplankton, Detritus, Nitrogen, and Iron. Parameters associated with\nan entity have its state-variable as a subscript. Although the entities are implicit, the identities of the causal processes are obscured. Close inspection of\nthe equations reveals that certain elements correspond to specific physical,\nchemical, and biological processes. Unfortunately, no specific markers for the\nprocesses exist, and in some cases the processes include elements from multiple\nequations.\n\n3.2 Process Modeling Representation\n\nHere, we illustrate the process modeling approach and provide a corresponding\nrepresentation of the Ross Sea ecosystem. We designed the modeling procedure\nto facilitate the construction of new models, but the task here differs somewhat in that we are translating an existing model. This presents additional\nchallenges that highlight important features of the approach.\nAs discussed in Section 2.3, the first step of the process modeling procedure\nis to create or to select a library of entity types and generic processes. In this\ncase, we need to generate a new library; therefore, we must identify the entities,\nentity types, processes and generic processes we expect to be significant in the\nmodel. Here, we infer these items from the existing equations. We conclude\nthis section by demonstrating how to build the instantiated model of the Ross\nSea ecosystem using the library.\n\n3.2.1 Entities\nAs already stated, entities are implicit in the original Ross Sea model; We\ncan infer them from the equations by examining the variables and parameters. Each of the variables in the left hand side of the differential equations\n(1\u20135) describe separate entities that are associated with parameters through\nsubscripts. In addition, we associate the driving variables (P URe , P URc and\nTH2 O ) with a separate entity we label Environment. Further, we assign the\n12\n\n\fvariables characterizing phytoplankton growth rate (\u03bc) and light and nutrient\ngrowth rate limitations to the phytoplankton entity.\nThe grazing rate (g) presents complications. It forms from the interaction\nof two entities, and it does not necessarily belong to either one. We might\nassociate it with a grazing process, but this is problematic. We show later that\nwe need this variable to operate in multiple processes, but in our framework\nvariables and parameters associated with a process cannot be accessed by\nanother process. We could create a new entity to house this variable, but for\nnow we associate it with Environment.\nThe next task is to determine if these entities are unique types, or if one or\nmore might be derived from the same general class. To make this decision, we\nexamined the parameters associated with each entity along with the roles the\nentities play in the model. Since nitrate and iron are both nutrients and operate\nsimilarly in the model, we decided to create generic entity called Nutrient. The\nremaining entities have unique types.\nTables 4 and 5 define the entity types (Phytoplankton, Zooplankton, Detritus,\nNutrient, and Environment) using the process modeling formalism. Presently,\nPhytoplankton and Environment are the only entity types with more than\none variable, which reflects the central roles they play in the Ross Sea model.\nIn addition to the driving variables and the grazing rate, we associated the\nparameter \u03b2 with Environment. This parameter determines the soluble and\ninsoluble fractions of organic matter, and supplants modeling the detailed\nprocesses of adsorption, flocking, and dissolution. While we designed these\nfive entity types to support the Ross Sea model, they could easily be modified\nto support other aquatic ecosystem models.\n\n3.2.2 Processes\nTo generate a generic process library we must know what physical, chemical, and biological processes might be relevant in the target model. Again,\nwe analyzed equations 1\u20139 to identify the processes required in our library.\nOur knowledge of the system, aquatic ecosystems in general, and ecological\ntheory guided this analysis and the construction of the library. We present the\nresulting generic process library in Tables 6 and 7.\nIn our analysis, we found that parameters in the original model guided the\nidentification of processes because they were originally selected to represent\nparticular aspects of the real system. To use these tags, we fully expanded\nthe differential equations and marked equation elements that seemed to cor13\n\n\fTable 4\nEntity types for the Ross Sea process model.\nentity Phytoplankton\ndescription This entity is a composite of the phytoplankton species.\nvariables\nconc {sum}, carbon concentration of phytoplankton\n\u03bc {sum}, realized growth rate\nik lim {sum}, light limitation of maximum growth rate\nn lim {sum}, nitrogen limitation of maximum growth rate\nf e lim {sum}, iron limitation of maximum growth rate\nparameters\n\u03bc0max [0,1], maximum unlimited phytoplankton growth rate at 0\u25e6 C\ne [0,1], exudation rate\nx [0,1], death rate\nikmax [0,\u221e], upper limit of ik\n\u03c9 [0,1], sinking rate\nbiomin [0,\u221e], minimum carbon concentration\nbioinhib [0,\u221e], photoinhibition of phytoplankton growth\n\u03c6(N/C) [0,1], ratio of nitrogen to carbon in phytoplankton\n\u03c6(F e/C) [0,1], ratio of iron to carbon in phytoplankton\nentity Zooplankton\ndescription This entity is a composite of the zooplankton species\nvariables\nconc {sum}, carbon concentration of zooplankton\nparameters\n\u03b3 [0,1], assimilation efficiency\nx [0,1], death rate\nr [0,1], respiration rate\n\u03c9 [0,1], sinking rate\ngmax [0,1], maximum grazing rate\nglim [0,\u221e], grazing limitation\ngcap [0,\u221e], grazing capacity\n\nrespond to processes. For example, we rewrote and labeled equation 1 as\ndP\n= \u03bcP \u2212 e\u03bcP \u2212 |xP{zP} \u2212 |\u03c9P{zP} \u2212 gZ .\n|{z}\n| {z }\n|{z}\ndt\nGrowth\n\nExudation\n\nDeath\n\nSinking\n\n(10)\n\nGrazing\n\nWe initially identified five processes in this equation: growth, exudation, death,\nsinking, and grazing. However, growth and exudation are not independent\nin the equation formulation because exudation is a constant proportion of\nthe amount of new growth (\u03bcP ). When we applied the same procedure to\nthe remaining differential equations we found that what we initially identi14\n\n\fTable 5\nEntity types for the Ross Sea process model (continued).\nentity Detritus\ndescription suspended particulate organic matter\nvariables\nconc {sum}, carbon concentration of detritus\nparameters\nr [0,1], remineralization rate of detritus\n\u03c9 [0,1], sinking rate\n\u03c6(N/C) [0,1], ratio of nitrogen to carbon in detritus\nentity Nutrient\ndescription dissolved nutrients in the water column\nvariables\nconc {sum}, dissolved nitrate concentration\nentity Environment\ndescription the system environment\nvariables\nTH2 O {sum}, sea water temperature\nP U Rc {sum}, average daily light intensity at the center of the modeled volume\nP U Re {sum}, average daily light intensity at the top edge of the modeled\nvolume\ng {sum}, rate of zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton\nparameters\n\u03b2 [0,1], proportion of matter that becomes soluble\n\nfied as a nutrient uptake process in equations (4) and (5) (\u2212\u03c6(P,C/N ) \u03bcP and\n\u2212\u03c6(P,C/F e) \u03bcP , respectively) was also formulated as a direct proportion of the\namount grown. Therefore, we treated exudation and nutrient uptake as subprocesses of growth, and bundled them into one phytoplankton growth process.\nWe made this decision to improve the understandability and causal flow of the\nprocess model.\nAlthough we divided the differential equations into different processes, we\ngenerally mapped the algebraic equations (6-9) into separate processes (Table 7). While bundling the calculation of the grazing rate (9) into the grazing\nprocess, and the equations for growth rate (6) with its nutrient and light limitations (7a, 8a, 8b) is conceptually reasonable, we chose to disaggregate these\nprocesses so that we could track them individually. In addition, segregating\nthese limitation processes lets us easily construct alternative processes with\na different formulation. For example, we could construct an alternative light\nlimitation process that does not include the photoinhibition term. In total, we\nencoded 11 generic processes that could operate in the Ross Sea ecosystem\nmodel.\n15\n\n\fTable 6\nGeneric process library used to construct a revised Ross Sea ecosystem model.\nlibrary RossSea\ngeneric process growth exp\nrelates P {P hytoplankton}, N O3 {N utrient}, F e{N utrient}\nequations d[conc.P, t, 1] = (1 \u2212 e.P ) \u2217 \u03bc.P \u2217 conc.P\nd[conc.N O3 , t, 1] = \u22121 \u2217 \u03c6(N/C) .P \u2217 \u03bc.P \u2217 conc.P\nd[conc.F e, t, 1] = \u22121 \u2217 \u03c6(F e/C) .P \u2217 \u03bc.P \u2217 conc.P\ngeneric process death exp\nrelates S{P hytoplankton, Zooplankton}, D{Detritus}, E{Environment}\nequations d[conc.S, t, 1] = \u22121 \u2217 x.S \u2217 conc.S\nd[conc.D, t, 1] = (1 \u2212 \u03b2.E)x.S \u2217 conc.S\ngeneric process grazing\nrelates P {P hytoplankton}, Z{Zooplankton}, D{Detritus}, E{Environment}\nequations d[conc.P, t, 1] = \u22121 \u2217 g.E \u2217 conc.Z\nd[Z, t, 1] = \u03b3.Z \u2217 g.E \u2217 conc.Z\nd[D, t, 1] = (1 \u2212 \u03b2.E) \u2217 (1 \u2212 \u03b3.Z) \u2217 g.E \u2217 conc.Z\ngeneric process respiration\nrelates Z{Zooplankton}\nequations d[conc.Z, t, 1] = \u22121 \u2217 r.Z \u2217 conc.Z\ngeneric process remineralization\nrelates D{Detritus}, N {N utirent}\nequations d[conc.D, t, 1] = \u22121 \u2217 r.D \u2217 conc.D\nd[conc.N, t, 1] = \u03c6(N/C) .D \u2217 r.D \u2217 conc.D\ngeneric process sinking\nrelates V {P hytoplankton, Detritus}\nequations d[conc.V, t, 1] = \u22121 \u2217 \u03c9.V \u2217 conc.V\ngeneric process growth rate\nrelates E{Environment}, P {P hytoplankton}\nequations \u03bc.P = (\u03bc0max .P \u2217 exp(0.0633 \u2217 TH2 0 .E)) *\nmin(ik lim.P, n lim.P, f e lim.P )\n\nThe process modeling formalism builds a new layer of information into the\nmodel that reflects additional modeling decisions regarding entities and processes. The growth process provides a good example. As we described earlier, we chose to include exudation and nutrient uptake in the phytoplankton growth process because they were not modeled as independent processes.\nHowever, this decision obscures the identity of these subprocesses. If the modeling task required that we maintain their identities, we could define a new\nvariable associated with the phytoplankton entity to represent the instantaneous amount of new phytoplankton growth (new growth.P ). With this new\nvariable, we show how we could formulate separate processes for exudation\nand the nutrient uptake in Table 8. This technique of identifying hidden vari16\n\n\fTable 7\nGeneric process library used to construct a revised Ross Sea ecosystem model (Continued).\ngeneric process growth limitation light w photoinhibition\nrelates P {P hytoplankton}, E{Environment}\nparameters a [0,2], fitting parameter\nequations ik lim.P = a \u2212 exp(\u2212P U Rc .E/\n(ikmax .P/(a+2.50\u2217exp(P U Re .E\u2217exp(1.089\u22121.12\u2217log10 (ikmax .P ))))))\u2217\nexp(\u2212P U Rc .E/photoinhib.P )\ngeneric process monod limitation\nvariables V {N utrient}\nparameters k, half-saturation constant\nequations m lim.V = con.V /(conc.V + k)\ngeneric process grazing rate\nvariables P {P hytoplankton}, Z{Zooplankton}, E{Environment}\nequations g.E = (gmax .Z \u2217 (conc.P \u2212 (biomin.P + glim .Z)))/\n(gcap .Z + (conc.P \u2212 (biomin.P + glim .Z)))\n\nables is especially useful when multiple processes that might be considered\nsub-processes impact the product of a process, or when we want a series of\nsub-processes to be explicit. These additional decisions make it a non-trivial\ntask to translate from equations to entities and processes or to construct an\ninitial library, while assembling the equations from entities and processes is\nsimple.\n3.2.3 Instantiated Model\nGiven a library of generic entities and processes, we instantiate candidate\nmodels using two steps. In the first step, we specify the instantiated entities.\nTable 8\nAlternative processes to explicitly model growth, exudation, and nutrient uptake\nprocess growth phyto\nequations d[conc.P, t, 1] = \u03bc \u2217 conc.P\nnew growth.P = \u03bc \u2217 conc.P\nprocess exudation\nequations d[conc.P, t, 1] = \u22121 \u2217 e.P \u2217 new growth.P\nprocess growth nutrient uptake NO3\nequations d[conc.N O3 , t, 1] = \u2212\u03c6(N/C) .P \u2217 new growth.P\nprocess growth nutrient uptake Fe\nequations d[conc.F e, t, 1] = \u2212\u03c6(F e/C) .P \u2217 new growth.P\n\n17\n\n\fFor the Ross Sea model, we instantiated one entity for Phytoplankton (P ),\nZooplankton (Z), Detritus (D), and Environment (E). We also instantiated\ntwo Nutrient entities named NO3 and F e. In the second step, we bind specific\ninstances of generic processes to members of the entity set. Then, using the\nmodeling procedure described in Section 2.3, we can consider multiple models with different structures. With the library in Tables 6 and 7, one of the\npossible candidate models will have the same structure as the original Ross\nSea model, while the remaining candidates will have a subset of the original\nmodel's structure. We could expand the number of candidate models and increase the number of processes in the model by adding new generic processes\nor alternative formulations of existing ones to the library.\nWe present a portion of the the original Ross Sea ecosystem model specified\nwith this formalism in Table 9. The instantiated model begins with the model\nname, after which come the instantiated entities and their types. 1 The next\nline declares the observed variables (i.e., those for which data are available).\nThe set of instantiated processes follows. The complete instantiated model\n(not shown) contains thirteen processes. Although this view of the model is\nnot as concise as the final set of equations, it conveys more information about\nthe model structure.\nFigure 1 shows the causal graph of the full Ross Sea process model drawn\nby Prometheus. Model variables are represented as ovals, processes are\nrectangles, and influence is shown by arrows. This diagram shows explicitly which processes and variables are included in the model, how they are\ndirectly linked, and where indirect connections occur. The ontological commitments forbid the direct connection of two variables. Instead, the influence\nmust be mapped through specific processes. This lets us explicitly map two\nor more minimum causal paths (variable1 \u2192 process \u2192 variable2 ) between\ntwo variables. Inspection of the diagram reveals three feedback loops. The\nfirst, conc.P \u2192 grazing rate \u2192 g.E \u2192 grazing \u2192 conc.P , shows the density\ndependence of grazing on the phytoplankton. Two additional loops show the\nfeedback of phytoplankton growth into itself through the two nutrient entities\n(e.g., growth Phyto \u2192 conc.NO3 \u2192 monod limitation nitrate \u2192 n lim.P \u2192\ngrowth rate phyto \u2192 \u03bc.P \u2192 growth Phyto). Feedback loops are difficult to\nsee in either the equation or process model representations alone, but they\nstand out in the network representation.\nAlong with recovering the original model, the process modeling approach lets\nusers explore alternative model structures with relative ease. Exhaustively\nsearching the library, we would also find many subsets of the original model\nthat may fit the observed data.

To explore this\npossibility, we could instantiate a model that excludes the zooplankton entity\nand its related processes. Within our framework, we would then compare the\nperformance of this model to the original one to help determine which is most\nappropriate. If we wanted to expand the model so that it differentiates between\nP. antarctica and the diatom phytoplankton, we could simply instantiate the\nphytoplankton entity type twice (e.g., replace P {P hytoplankton} in the entity\ndeclaration line with phaeo{P hytoplankton} and diatoms{P hytoplankton})\nand then instantiate the processes associated with phytoplankton a second\ntime, assigning one set to each phytoplankton group. If the scientists do not\nbelieve the same processes impact the two groups, they can search through\nalternative process instantiations. Again, we can add new generic processes\nor alternative formulations of generic processes to the library and implement\nthem with little difficulty. The ease with which users can develop and evaluate\nalternative model structures is one of the primary advantages of the process\n19\n\n\fFig. 1.

Here, we characterize the work's relevance and novelty.\nModeling the processes that generate system dynamics is not a new idea in\necology. In their textbook, J\u00f8rgensen and Bendoricchio (2001) make a strong\ncommitment to modeling specific processes. In Chapter 3, the authors describe several mathematical formulations of physical, chemical, and biological processes that commonly occur in ecological models. Gurney and Nisbet\n(1998) also discuss the importance of processes in modeling ecological dynamics, stating \"formulation of a dynamic model always starts by identifying the fundamental processes in the system under investigation.\" However,\nboth texts switch to sets of equations after processes are considered during\nmodel formulation. An additional emphasis on processes in ecological modeling appears in the growing use of process-based models (e.g., Brugnach,\n2005; Galbraith et al., 1980; Landsberg and Waring, 1997; McMurtrie, 1985;\nMelillo et al., 1993; Reynolds and Ford, 1999; Simioni et al., 2000). With an\nemphasis on processes, these models resemble those built with the approach\ndescribed in this paper. Brugnach (2005) shows clearly that process-based\n20\n\n\fmodels are conceptualized as a network of data flowing between processes\nthat operate on the data. However, model actors or entities are not clearly\ndelineated in this approach.\nIn an effort to create a general theory of modeling and simulation, Zeigler\n(1974) presents a framework that is very similar to the representation we\ndescribe. He describes models using three elements: components, descriptive\nvariables, and component interactions. Components are the parts of the system from which the model is constructed. Variables (and parameters) characterize the properties of the individual components, and collectively portray\nthe system's behavior. Component interactions are the relationships linking\ncomponents. From this description, it is seems that entities in our framework\ncaptures both Zeigler's components and descriptive variables. Our processes\nare a subset of Zeigler's component interactions. The difference between our\nrepresentation and Zeigler's approach stems from his desire to construct a general theory of modeling. In contrast, we focus on constructing continuous-time,\nsimulation models of mechanisms.\nOur conceptual framework is perhaps most similar to one described by Machamer et al.\n(2000) in their discussion of mechanisms in biology. They claim that mechanisms are composed of entities and activities. As in our framework, entities\nare the actors in a system, both creating and being affected by activities,\nwhich produce change in the system. Their activities seem equivalent to our\nprocesses, although the authors discuss and apply the framework to scientific\nreasoning in neurobiology and molecular biology. They do not show how it\nrelates to the mathematical models that arise in ecology, and they do not\ndevelop their ideas into a clear working methodology.\nAs in the process modeling approach, some ecological research generates and\ntests alternative possibilities. At the broadest level, if we consider each candidate model structure as a hypothesis of the system's structure and function or\nan alternative explanation for observed behavior, then searching the space of\nhypotheses is an extreme form of evaluating multiple alternative hypotheses\n(e.g., Carpenter et al., 1998; Hilborn and Mangel, 1997; Loehle, 1987b). More\nclosely related is the work of Jost and Arditi (2001), who manually fit models\nwith alternative formulations of the predation process to several predator\u2013prey\ndata sets. Their objective was to determine whether predation was best explained by predator density-dependent or -independent processes. Although\nthey compared alternative processes, they view their modeling approach as\na statistical fitting and selection of nonlinear models to population data, a\nmethodology gaining prominence in population ecology (e.g., Carpenter et al.,\n1994; Hilborn and Mangel, 1997; Jost and Arditi, 2000, 2001). However, their\napproach lacks an explicit notion of modeling as search.\nThe most closely related research is the approach to model revision introduced\n21\n\n\fby Reynolds and Ford (1999). They describe a multi-criteria assessment technique for evaluating process-based models that is used in an iterative modeling\ncycle to guide revision of both model structure and parameter selection. Like\nthe modeling approach discussed in this paper, the goal is to discover better\nmodel formulations. Two important differences stem from the fact that their\napproach does not provide a way to specify domain theory a priori. First, their\nprocedure only allows revision of an existing model; I t cannot guide search\nfor the initial model. Second, the methodology detects and generally locates\nmodel deficiencies, but it cannot suggest specific model revisions to make. The\nscientist must manually revise the model and then reapply the multi-criteria\nassessment.\n\n5\n\nDirections for Future Work\n\nAs the Ross Sea model shows, the approach described in this paper can be\nan effective tool for constructing, organizing, and communicating complicated\nmodels. However, there remain several ways in which the approach can be advanced. In particular, we see three ways of extending our approach to improve\nits utility for modeling environmental phenomena.\nThe first extension involves implementing a hierarchical organization of both\nentities and processes. Part of the complexity of environmental systems is that\ntheir components operate and interact with each other at multiple scales of\nspace and time. Hierarchical entities and processes are one way to capture this\ncomplexity that matches how biologist and ecologists tend to think about them\n(Ahl and Allen, 1996; Allen and Starr, 1982; O'Neill et al., 1986). For example, organisms are classified using a taxonomic hierarchy. The White-throated\nSparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis) is in the family Emberizidae, which is in the\nclass Aves of the Animal kingdom (National Geographic Society, 1999). Members of each taxonomic level share certain properties that are used to classify\nthem. We may also use hierarchical entities to encode spatial phenomena. We\nenvision using a set of entities to represent different physical locations, where\neach \"spatial entity\" contains relevant entities and processes for that space.\nFor example, in a lake ecosystem model we might represent the areas above\nand below the thermocline as two distinct entities. Finally, hierarchical processes would let us explicitly represent exudation and nutrient uptake in the\nRoss Sea ecosystem model as subprocesses of growth. We have already begun work on developing ways to represent and use such hierarchical processes\n(Todorovski et al., 2005).\nThe second extension addresses the criteria for selecting models. Information about ecological systems is typically heterogeneous; ecologists generally\nknow more about some parts of the system then others. For example, they\n22\n\n\fmay have continuous-time observations for some system variables but only\nknow the appropriate ranges or general trajectory shapes for others. Scientists often evaluate the plausibility of simulation models using all of these\ncriteria (e.g., Arrigo et al., 2003). At present, Prometheus only provides\ninformation about standard goodness-of-fit measures for the variables with\ncontinuous-time data. Although we may use this additional information to\nevaluate the models manually, we may also be able to encode the information\nand use it to guide automated search and selection of appropriate models.\nFinally, this modeling methodology creates new possibilities for analyzing system behavior. Sensitivity analysis is commonly used in ecological modeling to\ndetermine the effect of varying one or more parameters on the model behavior. However, we expect that performing a process-level sensitivity analysis\nwill lead to increased understanding of system dynamics because it will reveal\nwhich processes are primarily responsible for dynamics at a given time. This\ninformation will be useful for guiding additional experimental work, as well\nas assisting environmental assessment and management. Using the more common process-based ecological modeling approach, Brugnach (2005) provides\nan initial example of how such process sensitivity analysis might work.\n\n6\n\nSummary\n\nIn this paper, we described a novel method for representing and developing\nsimulation models of complex ecological and environmental systems. The representation builds on a two-part ontology that includes entities and processes.\nWith this formalism, we represent quantitative models in a way that approximates how scientists think about systems. We also develop reusable libraries\nof generic entities and processes based on existing ecological knowledge. We\nclaim that these libraries link model development to existing theory, facilitate\nmodel evaluation, and expedite model construction.\nTwo features contribute to the novelty of our modeling approach. First, we\nview model construction as search through a space of possible models. Second,\nwe instantiate model elements from generic components. The space of theoretically plausible models and the generic components are defined in libraries\nof domain specific entities and processes. We expect this approach to facilitate\nthe construction of ecological models both for theoretical development and for\nenvironmental assessment and management.\n23\n\n\f7\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis research was supported by NSF Grant No. IIS-0326059 and by NTT\nCommunication Science Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation.\n\nReferences\nAbarca-Arenas, L.
