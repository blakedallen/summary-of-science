When\nsuch objects enter the evolution period admitting geodetical motion of neutrinos, certain part of neutrinos produced in their interior will be trapped influencing their neutrino luminosity and thermal evolution.

The Randall-Sundrum model gives 4D Einstein gravity in\nlow energies and the Newtonian limit appears on the 3-brane with high accuracy. Significant deviations from the Einstein gravity occur at very high energies, in the early\nuniverse and in vicinity of compact objects as black holes and neutron stars [24].\nRecently, no exact solution of the full 5D Einstein equations is know, but there\nis a variety of astrophysically plausible special solutions of the 4D effective Einstein\nequations constrained to the brane. Such solutions describe black holes with spherical\nsymmetry [14] or with axial symmetry [5] and compact objects that could represent\nneutron (quark) stars [16]. The black hole spacetimes are determined by geometry of\nthe spherical Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m (R-N) and axial Kerr-Newman (K-N) type where\nthe electric charge squared is substituted by the braneworld \"tidal charge\" parameter representing the tidal (Weyl tensor) effects of the bulk space onto the 4D black\nhole structure. Astrophysically relevant properties of the braneworld black holes were\nstudied in a series of papers devoted to both motion of matter in their vicinity [42, 6,\n1, 26, 29] and optical phenomena [34, 33, 12, 11].\nIn the simple model of spherically symmetric stars with uniform energy density\nprofile a variety of special solutions having asymptotically Schwarzschildian character and satisfying the braneworld boundary conditions were found [16]. The most\npopular is the one with external spacetime described by the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m geometry with the braneworld tidal charge parameter reflecting the tidal effects of the\nbulk and related to the energy density and brane tension. Its properties were extensively studied both in the weak field limit [10, 9] and strong field limit when some\nrestrictions on the brane tension were implied from the data of kHz QPOs observed\nin low mass binary systems with a neutron star [21]. Here we focus our attention to\nthe interior of the compact objects, namely to the phenomena related to trapping of\nneutrinos in the so called Extremely Compact Stars (ECS) admitting (by definition)\nexistence of trapped null geodesics [44]. Usually, the braneworld tension is assumed\npositive while the related tidal charge has to be negative [16], but the negative tension\nand related positive tidal charge are not excluded [14], so we consider here both positive and negative tidal charge of the compact object. Note that exterior of neutron stars\nwith positive tidal charges can be described by both black-hole and naked-singularity\ntypes of the external R-N spacetime (for details see [21]).\nIn the standard (b = 0) internal Schwarzschild spacetimes of uniform energy density [35, 39] with radius R < 3GM/c2 , bound null geodesics exist being concentrated\naround the stable circular null geodesic [3, 41]. From the behaviour of the effective\npotential of null geodesics in the exterior, vacuum Schwarzschild spacetimes, determining the unstable null circular geodesics at the radius rph = 3GM/c2 (see, e.g.,\n[28]), we can conclude that any spherically symmetric, static non-singular interior\n\n\f3\n\nspacetime with radius R < rph admits existence of bound null geodesics. The trapped\nnull geodesics are then governed by both internal and external barriers of the null\ngeodesics effective potential. 1 The realistic equations of state admitting the existence\nof the extremely compact objects were found and investigated for neutron stars, quark\nstars and Q-stars [8, 27, 30, 44, 20, 31]. For spacetimes with a non-zero tidal charge,\nthe situation is more complex as we shall demonstrate in the following.\nThe existence of bound null geodesics in ECS has interesting astrophysical consequences. For example, using the notion of the optical reference geometry [4, 40,\n38] it was shown that trapped modes of gravitational waves could influence some\ninstabilities in these objects [2]. Trapping of neutrinos can be of high importance in\nthe interior of the ECS: first, it will suppress the neutrino flow as measured by distant observers and, second, it can influence cooling of the ECS in a layer extending\nfrom some radius depending on details of their structure up to the surface radius.\nThe cooling process could even be realized in a \"two-temperature\" regime, when the\ntemperature profile in the interior of the star with no trapped neutrinos differs from\nthe profile established in the external layer with trapped neutrinos [44] modifying\nsubstantially the standard picture of the neutron star structure as given in [17, 18, 19,\n46, 45]. In a different context, trapping of neutrinos inside rotating neutron stars has\nbeen discussed in [25].\nThe approximation of free, geodetical motion of neutrinos in the internal spacetime could be used when the mean free path of neutrinos \u03bb > R. Neutrinos have inelastic scatter on electrons (muons) and elastic scatter on neutrons. The scatter cross\nsection on electrons (neutrons) \u03c3e (\u03c3n ) determines the mean free path by formula\n\u03bb = (\u03c3i ni )\u22121 where ni (i = e, n) denotes the number density of electrons (neutrons).\nIt was shown [36] that\n\u03bbe \u223c 9 \u00d7 10\n\n7\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c1nucl\n\u03c1\n\n\u00134/3 \u0012\n\n100 keV\nE\u03bd\n\n\u00133\nkm,\n\n(1)\n\nwhile\n\u03c1nucl\n\u03bbn \u223c 300\n\u03c1\n\n\u0012\n\n100keV\nE\u03bd\n\n\u00132\nkm.\n\n(2)\n\nThere is \u03bbe & 10 km for E\u03bd . 20 MeV and \u03bbn & 10 km for E\u03bd . 500 keV. Therefore, in a few hours old neutron star, see [23, 36], at temperatures T . 109 K (E\u03bd \u223c\n100 keV), the neutrino motion could be considered geodetical through whole the internal spacetime.\nBound neutrinos with mean free path \u001d R will slow down the cooling. Of course,\nthey will be re-scattered due to finiteness of the mean free path. An eventual scattering\nof trapped neutrinos will cause change of their impact parameter, therefore, some of\nthem will escape the ECS, suppressing thus the slow down of the cooling process in\nthe region of neutrino trapping. Clearly, the scattering effect of the trapped neutrinos\nis a complex process deserving sophisticated numerical code based on the Monte\nCarlo method (we expect modelling of this effect in future).\n1 In principle, the bound null geodesics could exist also in objects having R > 3GM/c2 , e.g., in some\ncomposite polytropic spheres [30].\n\n\f4\n\nThe cooling process deserves sophisticated analytical estimates and detailed numerical simulations. As a first step in considering the role of trapped neutrinos in\nECS, efficiency of the neutrino trapping effect was studied in the simple case of the\ninternal Schwarzschild spacetime with uniform distribution of energy density (but a\nnontrivial pressure profile) and isotropic and uniform distribution of local neutrino\nluminosity, when all the calculations can be realized in terms of elementary functions\nonly (see [44]). 2 The influence on the neutrino luminosity of the star is given by a\nluminosity trapping coefficient relating the total number of trapped neutrinos and the\ntotal number of radiated neutrinos (per unit time of distant observers). The influence\non the cooling process is given by two \"cooling\" trapping coefficients: a \"local\" one\ngiven by ratio of trapped and radiated neutrinos at any radius where the trapping occurs, and the \"global\" one giving ratio of trapped and radiated neutrinos (per unit time\nof distant observers) integrated over whole the region where the trapping occurs.\nIn the present paper we study the role of the braneworld \"tidal charge\" parameter\non the existence of ECS and estimate its role in the efficiency of the neutrino trapping\nprocess using the same trapping coefficients as those introduced in [44]. We consider\nthe trapping effect in the simple case of objects with uniform distribution of energy\ndensity. The external field is given by the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m geometry [16]. This\nspecial solution is most extensively studied in the literature, since its external field is\nidentical to those of the black hole solution with spherical symmetry [14] - therefore, the results of our study could be efficiently compared to the results obtained in\nstudies of other phenomena [10, 21]. We consider both positive and negative values\nof the braneworld tidal parameter - usually, only the negatively valued tidal charges\n(corresponding to positive tension of the brane) are discussed [16], but the inverse\nsituation with positive tidal charge is not excluded and will be treated here, since it\ncould demonstrate some new interesting effects.\nOur paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we summarize properties and\nmatching conditions of the internal uniform energy density spacetime and the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m external spacetime. In Section 3, null geodesics of both the internal\nand external spacetime are described in terms of properly given effective potential\nand the ECS are classified according to the properties of the trapping region of the\nnull geodesic motion. In Section 4, the trapping of neutrinos is discused. In Section 5,\nthe trapping efficiency coefficients are defined for both the total neutrino luminosity\nand neutrino cooling process, and determined for all kinds of the braneworld ECS.\nIn Section 6, concluding remarks are presented. Throughout the paper, we shall use\nthe high-energy units with h\u0304 = c = kB = 1, if not stated otherwise. For simplicity, we\nassume zero rest energy of neutrinos, isotropic emission at each radius, and the period\nof evolution of the compact stars, when the temperature is low enough to describe the\nmotion of neutrinos by the null geodesics of the spacetime.\n\n2 The internal Schwarzschild spacetime can well represent the spacetime properties of realistic ECS [17,\n18, 19] which are crucial in estimating the role of neutrino trapping. Such a simple spacetime could serve\nquite well as a test bed for realistic models of ECS.\n\n\f5\n\n2 Braneworld neutron stars\nWe describe the braneworld neutron stars by the simple model of uniform energy\ndensity interior and the \"tidally\" charged exterior. We give the internal and external\ngeometry and the matching conditions. Accordingly, we determine conditions on the\nexistence of ECS depending on the tidal parameter characterizing the external spacetime.\n2.1 Matching conditions of internal and external spacetimes\nIn the standard Schwarzschild coordinates and the high-energy units, the line element\nof the spherically symmetric spacetimes reads\nds2 = \u2212A2 (r)dt 2 + B2 (r)dr2 + r2 d\u03a9 .\n\n(3)\n\nThe internal solution is characterized by the uniform energy density distribution\n- \u03c1 = const, and by the tension of the brane - \u03bb . We assume \u03c1 > 0, but we allow\nboth possibilities \u03bb > 0, \u03bb < 0 for completeness. The internal geometry is matched to\nthe external geometry at the surface of the star r = R.

It reads\n2\nRmin (b|b > 1) = b\n3\n\n(30)\n\nand is denoted by p \u2192 0. For smaller R the central pressure is not positive.\nNote that for \u221a\n3/4 < b < 1 there is a region of surface radii given by the condition\n2b/3 < R < 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 b where p(r = 0) is positive. However, the star surface is located under the inner horizon of the external spacetime that belongs to the black hole\ntype R-N spacetime. Such a configuration has to be hidden under the inner horizon\nof the external spacetime and is irrelevant for our considerations.\n\n2.3 Extremely compact neutron stars\nThe ECS (neutron, quark, or hybrid) are defined by the existence of trapped null\ngeodesics in the interior of the compact star. In the case of internal uniform density\nSchwarzschild spacetimes (b = 0), such objects appear just when the surface of the\ncompact star is located under the photon circular geodesic of the external vacuum\nSchwarzschild spacetime located at rph = 3rg [44]. In the braneworld uniform density\ncompact stars this simple rule does not hold and the situation is more complex due to\ndifferent character of the external spacetime and its relation to the internal spacetime.\nAssuming the external spacetime to be of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m (R-N) type\nwith the tidal charge substituting the electric charge squared appearing in the standard\nR-N spacetimes, the photon circular geodesics are given by the condition\nr2 \u2212 3rg r + 2q = 0.\n\n(31)\n\n\f9\n\n3.5\n\nII\n\nrph+\nR I+\n\nNONE\n\nECS\n\n3.0\nI\n\nRmin\n\n2.5\n\nRECS\nmax\n\nr\n\nrph+\npc \u00ae \u00a5\n\n2.0\n1.5\n\nrphFORBIDDEN AREA\n\nIV\na b\n\n1.0\n\nIII\nR Ipc \u00ae 0\n\n0.5\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\nb\n\nFig. 1 Classification of the extremely compact stars (ECS). The parameter space (b \u2212 R) is separated into\nfive Zones I\u2013IVa,b ; their properties are given in Section 3.1.\n\nHowever, it is convenient to use dimensionless tidal charge b and dimensionless\nradial coordinate defined by\nr/rg \u2192 r.\n(32)\nFor negative tidal charges (b < 0) external spacetimes of the black-hole type are\nallowed only [21]. The radii of the photon circular orbits are given by\n!\nr\n3\n8\nrph\u00b1 =\n1\u00b1 1\u2212 b .\n(33)\n2\n9\nHowever, only the outer photon circular geodesic at rph+ is physically relevant and\nwe see immediately that (b < 0) there is rph > 3.\nFor braneworld neutron stars with a positive tidal charge (b > 0) both black-hole\nand naked singularity R-N spacetimes are relevant [21]. In the black-hole type spacetimes (b \u2264 1), the photon circular orbits are given by the relation (33), but only the\nouter solution corresponding to an unstable orbit can be astrophysically relevant since\nthe surface of the compact star has to be located above radius of the outer horizon.\nIn the naked singularity spacetimes (b > 1) two photon circular orbits are can be\nastrophysically relevant when b < 9/8, the inner one being stable, the outer one -\nunstable. In the spacetimes with b > 9/8, no photon circular orbits can exist. Therefore, in the braneworld spacetimes, the existence of ECS is governed by the interplay\nof the behaviour of the internal and external effective potential of the motion and will\nbe determined and classified in the following section.\n3 Null geodesics of internal and external spacetimes\nIn terms of the tetrad formalism the metric (3) reads\nds2 = \u2212[\u03c9 (t) ]2 + [\u03c9 (r) ]2 + [\u03c9 (\u03b8 ) ]2 + [\u03c9 (\u03c6 ) ]2 ,\n\n(34)\n\n\f10\n\nwhere\n\u03c9 (t) = A(r) dt,\n\n\u03c9 (r) = B(r) dr,\n\n\u03c9 (\u03b8 ) = r d\u03b8 ,\n\n\u03c9 (\u03c6 ) = r sin \u03b8 d\u03c6 .\n\n(35)\n\nh\ni\n(\u03b1) \u22121\n\u03bc\n, the tetrad of 4-vectors is given by\nSince there is e(\u03b1) = \u03c9\u03bc\ne(t) =\n\n1 \u2202\n,\nA(r) \u2202t\n\ne(r) =\n\n1 \u2202\n,\nB(r) \u2202 r\n\ne(\u03b8 ) =\n\n1 \u2202\n,\nr \u2202\u03b8\n\ne(\u03c6 ) =\n\n1\n\u2202\n.\nr sin \u03b8 \u2202 \u03c6\n\n(36)\n\nTetrad components of 4-momentum of a test particle or a photon are determined by\n(\u03b1)\n\u03bc\nthe projections p(\u03b1) = p\u03bc e(\u03b1) , p(\u03b1) = p\u03bc \u03c9\u03bc which give quantities measured by the\nlocal observers.\n\n3.1 Null geodesics and effective potential\nWe consider the period of evolution and cooling of ECS when their temperature falls\ndown enough that the motion of neutrinos can be considered free, i.e., geodetical.\nWe can assume this period starts at the moment when mean free path of neutrinos\nbecomes to be comparable to the radius R, i.e., in hours after the gravitational collapse\ncreating the compact object [17, 18, 19, 45, 36]. In fact, there are arguments that this\ncondition starts to be fulfilled about 50 s after collapse to a proto-neutron star [23, 22].\nWeak interaction of ultrarelativistic (massless) neutrinos implies their motion along\nnull geodesics obeying the equations (\u03bb is an affine parameter)\nDp\u03bc\n= 0,\nd\u03bb\n\np\u03bc p\u03bc = 0.\n\n(37)\n\nDue to the existence of two Killing vector fields: the temporal \u2202 /\u2202t one, and the\nazimuthal \u2202 /\u2202 \u03c6 one, two conserved components of the 4-momentum must exist:\nE = \u2212pt\n\n(energy),\n\nL = p\u03c6\n\n(axial angular momentum).\n\n(38)\n\nMoreover, the motion plane is central. For a single-particle motion, one can set \u03b8 =\n\u03c0/2 = const, choosing the equatorial plane.\nThe motion along null-geodesics is independent of energy (frequency) and can\nconveniently be described in terms of the impact parameter\n`=\n\nL\n.\nE\n\n(39)\n\nThen (37) yields the relevant equation governing the radial motion in the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n`2\n(pr )2 = A\u22122 (r)B\u22122 (r)E 2 1 \u2212 A2 (r) 2 .\nr\n\n(40)\n\n\f11\n\nClearly, the energy E is irrelevant and can be used for rescalling of the affine parameter \u03bb .

We shall see in the following that due to the bulk\nspace tidal effects on the matching of the internal and external spacetimes (see [16]\nfor details) we obtain a non-standard variety of relations of the effective potentials in\nthe ECS interior and exterior.\nUsing the dimensionless radial coordinate expressed in terms of the gravitational\nradius (r/GM \u2192 r), and dimensionless tidal charge b, we obtain the relations\nV int\neff =\n\nr2 R2 [bY \u2212 2R(2b \u2212 3R)Z]2\n9 [b + (R \u2212 2)R] [(R \u2212 b) + R(2b \u2212 3R)Z]2\nV ext\neff =\n\nr4\n,\nb + (r \u2212 2)r\n\n,\n\n(42)\n\n(43)\n\nwhere\nq\nr2 (b \u2212 2R) + R4 ,\np\nZ \u2261 R\u2206 (R) = b + (R \u2212 2)R.\n\nY \u2261 R2 \u2206 (r) =\n\n(44)\n(45)\n\nCircular null geodesics, located at rc(i) and rc(e) , respectively, are given by the\nlocal extrema of the effective potential (\u2202Veff /\u2202 r = 0).

Here,\nand henceforth, we express the radii in units of the gravitational radius rg = GM .\nThe selection of the tidal charge values used in Figure 2 demonstrates the full classification of the behavior of the effective potential in both internal and external spacetimes. When the effective potential in the internal or external spacetime (or in both\nof them) has a local extreme corresponding to a photon circular geodesic, trapped\nnull geodesics can appear if the surface radius R is properly chosen giving an ECS.\nOn the other hand, we find an ordinary compact star if the surface is chosen in such\na way that no local extrema of the effective potentials exist (see Figure 2e). Separation of the zones of compact stars of different character, both extremely compact\nand ordinary compact, in the parameter space (b \u2212 R), is determined by the functions\nRmin (b), Rmax (b) and rph (b) where the last function governs radius of the photon\ncircular geodesics in the external spacetime (both of them for 1 < b < 9/8). The\nsubdivision of the Zone IV in the tidal charge range 1 < b < 9/8 is given by the relation of the magnitude of the effective potential at the surface of the ECS and the\nmagnitude of the external effective potential at its local minimum, and is determined\nnumerically (see Figure 1).\nWe divided the region of the parameter space R \u2212 b corresponding to the existence of ECS into five zones.

For external braneworld naked-singularity spacetimes with tidal charge in\nthe interval 1 < b < 9/8, an additional stable circular null geodesic exists that can be\nimportant for appearance and structure of accretion discs ([43]), but it is irrelevant\nfor trapping of neutrinos radiated by ECS.\nThe relation \u2202V int\neff /\u2202 r = 0 determines location of the stable circular null geodesics of the internal spacetime and implies the impact parameter which corresponds to\n2\nthe local maximum of the effective potential V int\neff at rc(i) to be given by `c(i) .\nFor b \u2264 9/8, the local minimum of V ext\neff is located at\nrc(e) =\n\n\u0011\n\u221a\n1\u0010\n3 + 9 \u2212 8b\n2\n\n(50)\n\nand corresponds to the unstable circular null geodesics of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m\nexternal spacetime, with the impact parameter determined by\n`2c(e)\n\n\u00014\n\u221a\n3 + 9 \u2212 8b\n\u0001.\n\u221a\n=\n8 3 \u2212 2b + 9 \u2212 8b\n\n(51)\n\nFor the ECS spacetimes corresponding to all of the Zones I\u2013IVa,b of the parameter\next\nspace (b\u2212R), typical behaviour of the effective potentials V int\neff and V eff is represented\nin Figure 3 where the regions of trapped neutrinos are shown explicitly.\n\n4.1 Regions of trapping\nBound neutrinos (depicted by the gray filled areas in Figure 3) may be fully trapped\ninside the internal spacetime, or may, in some spacetimes, appear outside the interior\nof the ECS being trapped by its strong gravitational field, and entering the interior\nagain; note that the trapped neutrinos moving outside the compact star occur in the\nspacetimes of the Zones I, II and IVa . Therefore, we divide the trapped neutrinos into\ntwo families:\n\u2022 \"Internal\" bound neutrinos (depicted using light gray filled area) with impact parameter between `2int (R) and `2c(i) ; motion of these neutrinos is restricted to the interior of the ECS. The internal bound neutrinos appear exclusively in spacetimes\nof the Zones III and IVb , but they occur also in the spacetimes of the Zones I and\nIVa .\n\u2022 \"External\" bound neutrinos (depicted by the dark gray filling) with impact parameter between `2c(e) and `2int (R); such bound neutrinos may leave the ECS interior, but they re-enter it.

In the spacetimes of the Zones III and IVb only \u03c8i cone is relevant, while for\nspacetime of the Zone II only angle \u03c8e is relevant.\n\nThe directional angle limit for the bound neutrinos is determined for spacetimes\nin the Zones I, II and IVa by the impact parameter `2c(e) . We arrive to the relation\nv\nu\n\u00014\n\u221a\n9 9 \u2212 8b + 3 Z 2 [(R \u2212 b)Y + R(2b \u2212 3R)Z]2\n1u\nt\n.\n4\u2212\ncos \u03c8e = \u00b1\n\u0001\n\u221a\n2\n2 \u22122b + 9 \u2212 8b + 3 r2 R2 [bY + 2R(3R \u2212 2b)Z]2\n\n(58)\n\nThe interval of relevant radii is given by r \u2208 (rb(e) , R).\nThe directional angle limit for the \"internal\" bound neutrinos is determined by\nequation (57), where for ` we use ` = `int (R). In the Zone II spacetimes, there are\nnone neutrinos bound only in their interior. On the other hand, for spacetimes in the\nZones III and IVb , this limit represents the total limit on all bound neutrinos. For the\ninternal neutrinos we arrive to the relation\ns\n9R2 [(R \u2212 b)Y + R(2b \u2212 3R)Z]2\ncos \u03c8i = \u00b1 1 \u2212\n.\n(59)\nr2 [bY + 2R(3R \u2212 2b)Z]2\nApparently, the condition \u03c8i > \u03c8e holds at any given radius r < R of the ECS spacetimes belonging to the Zones of the parameter space where both values have good\nmeaning.\n\n4.3 Local escaped to produced neutrinos ratio\nWe assume that neutrinos are locally produced by isotropically emitting sources.\nThen escaped-to-produced-neutrinos ratio depends on a geometrical argument only.\n\n\f18\n\nIt is determined by the solid angle 2\u03a9 corresponding to escaping neutrinos (also inward emitted neutrinos must be involved because even these neutrinos can be radiated\naway), see Figure 5.\nLet Np , Ne and Nb denote, respectively, the number of produced, escaped and\ntrapped neutrinos per unit time of an external static observer at infinity. In order to\ndetermine the global correction factors\nE (R, b) \u2261\n\nNe (R, b)\n,\nNp (R, b)\n\nB(R, b) \u2261\n\nNb (R, b)\n= 1 \u2212 E (R, b),\nNp (R, b)\n\n(60)\n\nit is necessary to introduce the local correction factor for trapped neutrinos at a given\nradius r \u2208 (rb(e) , R) (or r \u2208 (rb(i) , R), if relevant).\nIn the general case of non-isotropic emission of neutrinos, the escaped-to-produced ratio is given by the expression\nZ\u03a8eZ2\u03c0\n\np(\u03a8 ) sin\u03a8 d\u03a8 d\u03c6\n\n\u03a9e (\u03a8e ) =\n\n(61)\n\n0 0\n\nwith p(\u03a8 ) being a directional function of the emission (scattering) process. Because of the assumption of isotropic emission of neutrinos in the frame of the static\nobservers, the escaping solid angle \u03a9e (\u03a8e ) determines fully the ratio of escapedproduced neutrinos and is given by\nZ\u03a8eZ2\u03c0\n\n\u03a9e (\u03a8e ) =\n\nsin\u03a8 d\u03a8 d\u03c6 = 2\u03c0(1 \u2212 cos\u03a8e ).\n\n(62)\n\n0 0\n\nThe escaping correction factor\n\u03b5(r, R, b) =\n\ndNe (r, R, b) 2\u03a9 (\u03c8e (r, R, b))\n=\n= 1 \u2212 cos \u03c8e (r, R, b),\ndNp (r, R, b)\n4\u03c0\n\n(63)\n\nwhile the complementary factor for trapped neutrinos\n\u03b2 (r, R, b) = 1 \u2212 \u03b5(r, R, b) =\n\ndNb (r, R, b)\n= cos \u03c8e (r, R, B).\ndNp (r, R, b)\n\n(64)\n\nNotice that we consider production and escaping rates at a given radius r, but the\nradius R of the compact object enters the relation as it determines the escaping directional angle. The coefficient \u03b2 (r, R, b) determines local efficiency of the neutrino\ntrapping, i.e., the ratio of the trapped and produced neutrinos at any given radius\nr \u2208 (rb(e) , R) or r \u2208 (rb(i) , R). Its profile is shown for several representative values\nof the tidal charge b and related sequences of the surface radius R in Figures 6, 7.\nThe local maxima of the function \u03b2 (r, R, b) (with R and b being fixed) are given by\nthe condition \u2202 \u03b2 /\u2202 r = 0 which is satisfied at radius r = rc(i) implying coincidence\nwith the radius of the stable circular null geodesic, as anticipated intuitively. For the\nZone II the maxima are naturally located at the surface radius.

The upper figure corresponds to the case when two circular\nnull geodesics of the external spacetime can exist (b = 1.08), while the lower figure corresponds only to\nthe spacetimes where no circular null geodesic exists in the external spacetime (b = 1.2). The gray line\nconnects the local maxima of the \u03b2 (r/R, b) profiles. The figures are constructed in the same way as those\npresented for the black-hole external spacetimes.\n\n\f21\n\nWe can see that the local trapping factor in any given ECS spacetime reaches its\nmaximal values at the radius corresponding to the stable circular null geodesic and\ndecreases as the radius falls to the centre of the ECS. Nevertheless, the trapping region can extend down to the region near the centre only for the most compact ECS\nwith external spacetime of the black-hole type (for both negative and positive tidal\ncharges), having surface radius close the minimal allowed surface radius. The maximum of the \u03b2 (r, R, b) profile then reaches value of \u03b2 \u223c 1 close to the centre, where\nthe stable null circular geodesic is located in such spacetimes. On the other hand, for\npositively tidally charged ECS with external spacetime of the naked-singularity type,\nthe \u03b2 (r, R, b) profile cannot reach the central part and its maximum is much smaller\nthan \u03b2 = 1.\n\n4.4 Neutrino production rates\nGenerally, the neutrino production is a very complex process depending on detailed\nstructure of an extremely compact object. We can express the locally defined neutrino\nproduction rate in the form\nI (r{A }) =\n\ndN (r{A })\n,\nd\u03c4(r)\n\n(65)\n\nwhere dN is the number of interactions at radius r, \u03c4 is the proper time of the static\nobserver at the given r, {A } is the full set of quantities relevant for the production\nrate. We can write that\ndN (r) = n(r)\u0393 (r)dV (r),\n(66)\nwhere n(r), \u0393 (r) and dV (r) are the number density of particles entering the neutrino\nproduction processes, the neutrino production rate and the proper volume element at\nthe radius r, respectively. Both n(r) and \u0393 (r) are given by detailed structure of the\nextremely compact objects, dV (r) is given by the spacetime geometry.\nHere, considering the uniform energy density braneworld stars (for requirements\nof more realistic model see, e.g., [31, 45]), we shall assume the local production rate\nto be proportional to the energy density, i.e., we assume uniform production rate as\nmeasured by the local static observers; of course, from the point of view of static observers at infinity, the production rate will not be distributed uniformly. (According to\n[17, 18, 19], such toy model could be reasonable good starting point for more realistic\ncalculations.)\nIn the internal spacetime we can thus write the local neutrino production rate in\nthe form\ndN\nI (r) =\n\u221d \u03c1 = const.\n(67)\nd\u03c4\nThe local neutrino production rate related to the distant static observers is then given\nby the relation including the time-delay factor\nI=\n\ndN\n= I A(r, R, b).\ndt\n\n(68)\n\n\f22\n\nThe number of neutrinos produced at a given radius in a proper volume dV per unit\ntime of a distant static observer (that are governed by the internal metric coefficients)\nis given by the relation\ndNp (r, R, b) = I(r, R, b) dV (r) = 4\u03c0I A(r, R, b) B(r, R, b) r2 dr.\n\n(69)\n\nIntegrating through whole the compact object (from 0 to R), we arrive to the global\nneutrino production rate in the form\nZ R\n\nNp (R, b) = 4\u03c0I\n\nA\u2212 (r, R, b)B\u2212 (r, R, b)r2 dr.\n\n(70)\n\n0\n\nIn an analogical way, we can give the expressions for the global rates of escaping and\ntrapping of the produced neutrinos:\nZ R\n\nNe (R, b) = 4\u03c0I\n\nrb(e)\n\n(1 \u2212 cos \u03c8e (r, R, b))A\u2212 (r, R, b)B\u2212 (r, R, b)r2 dr +\n\n+Np (rb(e) ),\nZ R\n\nNb (R, b) = 4\u03c0I\n\nrb(e)\n\n(71)\n\ncos \u03c8e (r, R, b)A\u2212 (r, R, b)B\u2212 (r, R, b)r2 dr,\n\n(72)\n\nwhere rb(e) is the radius given by equation (52) and cos\u03a8e (r, R, b) is determined by\nequation (58). In ECS spacetimes with parameters belonging to the Zones where rb(e)\nhas not good meaning, its role takes rb(i) , while we replace cos \u03c8e for cos \u03c8i . In such\nECS spacetimes all bound neutrinos are the internal ones.\n5 Efficiency of neutrino trapping\nIn order to characterize the trapping of neutrinos in extremely compact stars, we\nintroduce some coefficients giving the efficiency of the trapping effect in connection\nto the total neutrino luminosity and the cooling process in the period of the evolution\nof the star corresponding to the geodetical motion of neutrinos.\n5.1 Trapping coefficient of total neutrino luminosity\nThe influence of the trapping effect on the total neutrino luminosity of ECS can be\nappropriately given by the coefficient BL relating the number of neutrinos produced\ninside the whole compact star during unit time of distant observers and the number of\nthose produced neutrinos that will be captured by the extremely strong gravitational\nfield of the star. The total luminosity trapping coefficient is therefore given by the\nrelation\nRR\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2\nrb(e) A (r, R, b)B (r, R, b) cos \u03c8e (r, R, b) r dr\n,\n(73)\nBL (R, b) =\nRR\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2\n0 A (r, R, b)B (r, R, b)r dr\nwhere\nA\u2212 B\u2212 =\n\n3RZ [(R \u2212 b)Y + R(2b \u2212 3R)Z]\n,\nY [2R(2b \u2212 3R)Z \u2212 bY ]\n\n(74)\n\n\f23\n\n1.0\n\n0.8 b = 0\n\nb=0\n\n0.8\nB L , QL\n\nB L , QL\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n2.4\n\n2.6\n\n2.8\n\n3.0\n\n3.2\n\n3.4\n\n3.6\n\n1.0\n\nR\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nR\n\nFig. 8 The total luminosity trapping coefficient BL (R, b) (full lines) and the internal luminosity trapping\ncoefficient QL (R, b) (dashed lines) as functions of the surface radius R for fixed characteristic values of\nthe tidal charge b.

The values of b are equally spaced with interval of 0.2 for b < 1 and 0.7 for\nb > 1.\n\nand the complementary luminosity \"escaping\" coefficient is determined by the simple\nformula\nEL (R, b) = 1 \u2212 BL (R, b).\n(75)\nWe can, moreover, define other global characteristic coefficients. For the \"internal\" neutrinos with motion restricted to the interior of the star, we introduce a coefficient\nRR\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2\nrb(i) A (r, R, b)B (r, R, b) cos \u03c8i (r, R, b) r dr\n(76)\nQL (R, b) =\nRR\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2\n0 A (r, R, b)B (r, R, b)r dr\nand for the \"external\" neutrinos, we can use a complementary coefficient\nXL =\n\nNext\n= BL \u2212 QL .\nNp\n\n(77)\n\nThe results are illustrated for the coefficients BL (R, b), QL (R, b) in Figure 8.\nThe behaviour of the total luminosity trapping factor is qualitatively the same for\nECS with external spacetimes of the black-hole type for both negative and positive\ntidal charges, but it has qualitatively different character for the black-hole and nakedsingularity ECS spacetimes. In the black-hole-type ECS it monotonously increases\nwith decreasing surface radius for any fixed tidal charge (both negative and positive),\nwhile in the naked-singularity-type ECS spacetimes it reaches a maximum between\nthe centre and the surface radius R, and then it decreases to zero value for surface\nradius approaching the minimal value of R.\nFor the black-hole-type ECS with negative tidal charges the maximum of the coefficient BL (R, b) slightly decreases with decreasing b, while for positively tidally\ncharged ECS it increases with increasing b approaching BL (R, b) = 1 for b \u2192 1. We\nobserve a similar behavior also for QL (R, b), but the magnitude of this coefficient is\nsmaller in comparison with BL (R, b). In the naked-singularity-type ECS (with positive tidal charges) the local maximum of BL (R, b) (and QL (R, b)) strongly decreases\nwith b increasing; of course, for ECS in the Zone III of the space of parameters, the\nparameter QL (R, b) is not defined.\n\n\f24\n\n1.0\n0< b <27\u009020\n\nb<0\nb=0\n\n0.8\n\nBc\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\nR\n\nFig. 9 The global cooling coefficient related to trapping of neutrinos in the active zone of trapping\nBC (R, b). For tidal charge b fixed for values with the same interval as in the previous figure and the\nfull range of R corresponding to the ECS is scanned.\n\n5.2 Trapping coefficient of neutrino cooling process\nThe efficiency of the influence of neutrino trapping on the cooling process is most\neffectively described by the local coefficient of trapping bc relating the trapped and\nproduced neutrinos at a given radius of the star that is defined by the relation\nbc (r, R, b) \u2261 \u03b2 (r, R, b).\n\n(78)\n\nThe local cooling coefficient is therefore given in Figures 6, 7 for appropriately chosen tidal charges b and related sequences of the surface radius R. All the properties of\nthe local trapping coefficient discussed above are thus relevant for the local cooling\nphenomena.\nFurther, the cooling process can be appropriately described in a complementary\nmanner by a global coefficient for trapping, restricted to the \"active\" zone, where the\ntrapping of neutrinos occurs. The global cooling coefficient is thus defined by the\nrelation\nRR\n\u2212\n\u2212\nrb(e,i) A (r, R, b)B (r, R, b) cos \u03c8e,i (r, R, b)dr\n.\n(79)\nBc (R, b) \u2261\nRR\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2\nrb(e,i) A (r, R, b)B (r, R, b)r dr\nThe global \"cooling\" coefficient Bc (R, b) is presented in Figure 9 - for few characteristic values of the tidal charge b, both negative and positive, the full range of the\nESC surface radius is scanned.\nThe behaviour of the global cooling factor Bc (R, b) is of the same character as\nfor the total luminosity factor BL (R, b) in both black-hole and naked-singularity-type\nECS and for both negative and positive tidal charges. Its magnitude is nearly twice\nhigher than those of the total luminosity factor for the surface radii R close to their\nmaximal value, but it is nearly equal to the total luminosity factor as R approaches its\nminimal value.\n\n\f25\n\n6 Conclusions\nWe have demonstrated that the braneworld ECS can be separated into five classes\ncorresponding to five Zones of the parameter space (b \u2212 R) where trapping of neutrinos and their motion in the external field of the ECS are realized in qualitatively\ndifferent way. There are fundamental differences of the trapping effect in the field\nof ECS with negative and positive tidal charges. The differences are related to both\nthe surface radius of the ECS and the trapping coeffients of both kind - for the total luminosity and the cooling process. Moreover, there is a strong difference of the\ntrapping efficiency in the ECS with positive tidal charge when related to the blackhole spacetimes and the naked-singularity spacetimes. In the first case, the trapping is\nvery efficient and the global trapping coefficient can approach the value of 1 for the\nspacetimes with b \u2192 1, while in the second case the coefficients strongly decrease\nfor tidal charges growing above the critical value of b = 1.\nThere is an astrophysically very important effect related to the surface radius of\nthe ECS with the negative and positive tidal charges. For b < 0, the surface radius of\nECS can significantly overcome the limiting value of R = 3 valid for b = 0. On the\nother hand, for b > 0, the surface radius of ECS decreases under the standard value\nof R = 3 - for ECS with b \u223c 1, there is Rmax \u223c 2.3 that is substantially lower than\nthe values indicated by observations, and for b > 1 the ECS surface radius decreases\nfurther.\nIn the ECS spacetimes with negative charge there is a crucial effect related to\nthe increase of the surface radius of the ECS allowed for decreasing b < 0. For tidal\ncharges slightly under the value of b \u223c \u22121, the ECS surface radius approaches R = 4\nstrongly overcoming the limit of R = 3 corresponding to the standard Schwarzschild\nspacetimes and enters the region of values commonly accepted for observed neutron stars that can be lowered down to R = 3.5 [23, 13]. In such cases the coefficient of total luminosity can be of quite significant value for astrophysically realistic radii of ECS. For example, in the case of ECS with R = 3.5 and b = \u22121.2,\nthere is BL (R, b) \u223c 0.023. The global cooling coefficient can approach even the\nvalue of Bc (R, b) \u223c 0.077 under such conditions, indicating thus very strong and\nsignificant effects of trapping for braneworld negatively charged ECS, significantly\novercoming the related values corresponding to the standard (tidally non-charged)\nspacetimes [44]. Because the effect of trapping of neutrinos is cumulative, one can\nexpect its relevance in realistic models of ECS to be strongly enhanced by negative\ntidal charges. Note that the conditions on the tidal charge magnitude implied by the\nhigh-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations observed in some low-mass-X-ray- binaries containing neutron or quark stars put the limit b < 1.2 (assuming their mass\nm \u223c 2M ) [21]. This limit allows for sufficient increasing of the ECS surface radius\nwith negative tidal charges enabling strong effects of neutrino trapping in the interior of such ECS with observationally acceptable radius. The expected lowering of\nthe neutrino luminosity in observed neutron stars can be about \u223c 10 % and could be\nobservationally tested.\nWe can conclude that the negative tidal charges cause slight decrease of the efficiency of the trapping phenomena in the field of ECS, but they significantly shift\nthese phenomena to the region of astrophysically relevant situations due to the strong\n\n\f26\n\nincrease of the surface radius of such ECS, shifting the radius to values acceptable\nobservationally. On the other hand, the positive tidal charges generally enhance the\ntrapping effects for the ECS spacetimes of the black-hole type, but the surface radius\nof such ECS is strongly shifted to the regions excluded observationally.\nAcknowledgements The present work was supported by the Czech grants MSM 4781305903, LC 06014,\nGA\u010cR 205/09/H033 and the internal grant SGS/2/2010.
