Reaching a microscopic understanding of the physical and chemical properties of defects in\nsolids has long been a goal of first-principles electronic\nstructure methods. Probably the most widespread theoretical method in this realm today is density functional\ntheory (DFT) in the local-density (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA), but certain intrinsic deficiencies limit their predictive power. Artificial\nself-interaction and the absence of the derivative discontinuity in the exchange-correlation potential [1] present\nthe most notable deficiencies in this context. They give,\namongst other things, rise to the band-gap problem \u2013 the\nfact that the band gap in LDA and GGA underestimates\nthe quasiparticle gap [1, 2]. In this Letter we show that\nthe band-gap problem in LDA/GGA not only affects the\nreliable computation of defect levels, but in certain cases\n(e.g. filled defect states in the band gap) also that of formation energies. We present a formalism for calculating\nformation energies of defects in solids that combines LDA\nwith quasiparticle energy calculations in the G0 W0 approximation [3] to reduce the self-interaction error and to\novercome the band-gap problem. In some cases a heuristic \"scissor operator\" approach may approximately correct the problem. However, particularly when the experimental answer is unknown, a more accurate method is\nneeded.\nWe illustrate our approach with the example of a selfintersitital in silicon (Sii ), a defect of high technological\nrelevance [4, 5, 6]. In the neutral charge state the Sii has\nseveral stable and metastable atomic configurations [7, 8]\n(see Fig. 1), in all of which two electrons occupy a defect level in the band gap. The LDA formation energies\nof all these configurations are underestimated severely\n(by \u223c1.5 eV) compared to diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC)\ncalculations [9, 10]. However, no insight into this dis-\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) a) Split<110>, b) hexagonal, c) C3v\nand d) tetrahedral configuration of the Sii . Defect atoms are\nshown in red and nearest neighbours in grey. The middle\npanel depicts the formation of the neutral Sii from the 2+\ncharge state. A+ and A2+ are short for the electron affinities\nA(+, R0 ) and A(2+, R2+ ) (see text), respectively, and Rq\ndenotes the atomic positions in charge state q.\n\ncrepancy is provided by the DMC calculations.\nIn our formalism the formation of the neutral defect is\nexpressed as successive charging of its 2+ charge state,\nfor which the defect level is unoccupied. This allows us\nto decompose the formation energy into that of the 2+\nstate (E f (2+)), a lattice and an electron addition part.\nThis decomposition is not only insightful for analyzing\nthe underestimation of the LDA formation energy, but\nalso permits us to apply the most suitable method for\neach type of contribution [11]. For the lattice part we retain the LDA and argue that the relaxation energies and\nE f (2+) are not as strongly affected by the deficiencies of\nthe LDA as in the positive and the neutral case since the\ndefect level in the band gap is unoccupied. For the electron affinities, on the other hand, we employ Hedin's GW\nmethod [3]. Since self-consistency in GW is still discussed\ncontroversially [2] we obtain the quasiparticle corrections\n\n\f2\nto the LDA Kohn-Sham energies from first order perturbation theory (G0 W0 ), which is currently the method\nof choice for computing quasiparticle band structures in\nsolids [2, 12]. While not completely self-interaction free\n[13] G0 W0 significantly reduces the self-interaction error.\nWith this combined approach the formation energy in the\nneutral charge state increases by \u223c1.1 eV compared to\nthe LDA. Recent DFT calculations employing the HSE\nhybrid functional, which also significantly reduces the\nself-interaction error, yield a similar improvement [10]\nand lend further substance to this notion. Moreover, the\nG0 W0 -corrected charge transition levels agree well with\nrecent experimental measurements [4].\nWe will present our combined DFT+G0 W0 approach\nfor the example of the Sii , but it can easily be generalized\nto defects in other materials. An additional silicon atom\nin an interstitial site can adopt different configurations\nwith similar formation energies (cf. Fig. 1). In the tetrahedral (tet) geometry the extra silicon atom gives rise\nto an a1 and a threefold degenerate t2 state. The latter is empty and in resonance with the conduction band.\nThe partial occupation of the degenerate t2 state triggers\na Jahn-Teller distortion along the <111>-axis into a geometry with C3v symmetry, also referred to as \"displaced\nhexagonal structure\" in previous studies [14]. The addition of a second electron displaces the atom further in\nthe <111>-direction stabilizing the neutral charge state.\nThis sequence is illustrated in Fig. 2. Moving the interstitial atom along the <111>-direction into the center\nof a six-membered ring (hexagonal (hex) configuration)\nlowers the neutral state further in energy. It reaches its\nlowest position in the split<110> configuration, where\nthe added atom and a host atom share an interstitial site\noriented in the <110>-direction.\nFor the 2+ charge state the tetrahedral is the most\nstable configuration [8] (see also Table I) and we will use\nit as a starting point for building our scheme. The positive charge state is then formed by adding one electron\nas depicted in steps 1 and 2 in Fig. 1. Mathematically\nthis can be expressed by starting from the expression for\nthe formation energy in the positive charge state\nf\nED\n(+, \u000fF ) = E(+, RD\n+ ) \u2212 Eref + \u000fF\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nE(q, RD\nq 0 ) is the total energy in charge state q and atomic\npositions RD\nq 0 of defect configuration D in charge state\nq 0 . Eref is a suitably chosen reference system, here bulk\nsilicon, and \u000fF the Fermi level of the electrons referenced\nto the top of the valence band. Adding and substracting\ntet\nfirst E(+, Rtet\n2+ ) and then E(2+, R2+ ) leads to\nf\ntet\ntet\nED\n(+, \u000fF ) =\u2206(+, RD\n+ , R2+ ) + A(2+, R2+ )\nf\n+ Etet\n(2+, \u000fF = 0) + \u000fF\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\ntet\nThe energy difference E(+, Rtet\n2+ ) \u2212 E(2+, R2+ ) defines\ntet\nthe vertical electron affinity A(2+, R2+ ) of the 2+ state\n\n(in its tetrahedral configuration), step 1 in Fig. 1,\nreferenced to the top of the valence band, whereas\ntet\nE(+, RD\n+ ) \u2212 E(+, R2+ ) gives the subsequent relaxation\nD\ntet\nenergy \u2206(+, R+ , R2+ ) in the positive charge state (step\n2).\nSimilarly the neutral charge state emerges from the\npositive one by addition of an electron. Mathematically\nwe again achieve this by adding and substracting first\nD\nE(+, RD\n0 ) and then E(+, R+ ) to and from the expression\nf\nfor the neutral formation energy ED\n(0, \u000fF ) = E(0, RD\n0 )\u2212\nEref :\nf\nD\nD\nED\n(0, \u000fF ) =A(+, RD\n0 ) + \u2206(+, R0 , R+ )\n\n+ EfD (+, \u000fF = 0) .\n\n(3)\n\nAgain A(+, RD\n0 ) denotes a vertical electron affinity\nD\nD\nE(0, RD\n)\n\u2212\nE(+,\nRD\n0\n0 ) (step 4) and \u2206(+, R0 , R+ ) =\nD\nD\nE(+, R0 ) \u2212 E(+, R+ ) the relaxation energy from the\nneutral to the positive geometry in the positive charge\nstate (step 3). An expression for the negative charge state\nf\ncan be obtained completely analogously once ED\n(0, \u000fF =\n0) has been computed.\nThe decomposition in Eq. (2) and (3) is not only appealing from an intuitive point of view, but also groups\nthe required total-energy differences into two categories:\nlattice contributions in a fixed charge state and electron\naddition energies at fixed geometry. This permits us to\ngo beyond a pure DFT description in an easy fashion\nby employing the most suitable method for each type of\ncontribution [11]. Since we expect relaxation energies in\nthe same charge state to be given reliably by LDA we\nretain DFT for the lattice part. For the electron addition energies, i.e., changes in charge state, which are\ntypically problematic in LDA, we instead resort to the\nG0 W0 method.\nThe last remaining quantity to be assigned is\nf\n(2+, \u000fF = 0), which we compute in the LDA. UnEtet\nlike for the neutral state, the absence of DMC reference\ndata unfortunately does not permit an assessment of the\nLDA error in this case. However, since the conductionband-derived defect levels are unoccupied the effect of\nthe self-interaction and the band-gap error on the formation energy should be small. We therefore expect LDA\nto be more reliable for the tetrahedral 2+ state than for\nthe neutral or the positive states.\nThe LDA calculations in the present work have been\nperformed with the plane-wave, pseudopotential code\nS/PHI/nX [15]. 64-atom supercells were used throughout, unless otherwise noted. To remove the contributions\narising from the homogeneous compensation charge density that is added to charged supercell calculations we\nhave performed calculations for supercells with 64, 216\nand 512 atoms. In these the interstitial atom was placed\nin the tetrahedral (2+) and the C3v (+) position of a\nperfect (undistored) Si lattice.

The tetrahedral configuration is taken as the 2+\nstate of the C3v . Corrections for charged supercells (see text) have been added. All values are given in eV.\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Vertical electron affinities for different\nconfigurations of the Sii : LDA Slater transition states (blue)\nand G0 W0 quasiparticle energies (red).\n\nextrapolating to infinite length we obtain corrections to\nthe 64-atom cell of 0.17 eV and 0.04 eV for the 2+ and\n+ state, respectively. Our extrapolated formation energy\nfor the unrelaxed tetrahedral 2+ state of 3.19 eV agrees\nwell the 3.31 eV obtained by Wright and Modine for a\nslightly larger lattice constant [16]. With this correction the formation energy of the relaxed tetrahedral 2+\nconfiguration amounts to 2.65 eV. Applying a recently\ndeveloped improved correction scheme [17] yields a corrected value of 2.66 eV, in excellent agreement with our\nextrapolated value.\nFor the G0 W0 calculations [18] we have employed the\nG0 W0 space-time code gwst [19, 20, 21]. For computational convenience we calculate the electron affinity of\npositive charge states (A(+, R0D )) by their inverse process, the electron removal from the neutral state, since\nno spin polarization or partially filled defect states are\nencountered then. Separate G0 W0 calculations for bulk\nsilicon yield a band gap of 1.27 eV in good agreement\nwith previous pseudopotential G0 W0 calculations [12].\nThe computed vertical electron affinities are shown in\nFigure 2. For comparison the LDA affinities calculated\nas Slater transition states [22] at half occupation have\nbeen included. The G0 W0 corrections for the +/0 state\nare similar for the three configurations and relatively\nsmall (\u223c0.2 eV). For states that in the LDA are in resonance with the conduction band, however, the G0 W0 corrections are much more pronounced. Since these states\nhave a contribution from delocalized conduction-band\n\nstates the delocalization error of the LDA [23] leads to\na breakdown of Slater transition state theory. The resulting severe underestimation of the vertical affinities\nis akin to the band-gap problem. In LDA the band\ngap Eg = I \u2212 A, where I is the ionization potential\nand A the electron affinity, is underestimated regardless of whether I and A are calculated as total energy\ndifferences or by Kohn-Sham eigenvalues, because the\nexchange-correlation functional is a continuous function\nof the electron density and therefore does not exhibit a\nderivative discontinuity. Many-body perturbation theoy\nin the GW approach, on the other hand, does not suffer\nfrom this problem.\nHaving identified the relevant electron affinities we can\nnow return to the formation energies in Eqs. (2) and (3).\nTable I shows that already upon adding the first electron\nto the 2+ state we observe a large correction (\u223c0.9 eV)\nfor the formation energy of the positive state. This error subsequently carries over to the neutral charge state,\nand adding the second electron incurs a further increase.\nThe G0 W0 -corrected formation energies are now on average 1.1 eV larger than in the LDA. Since the quasiparticle\nshift of the empty defect state in the split<110> configuration is smaller than the band-gap opening the state\nis moved into the band gap (A(0, Rsplit\n)=1.1 eV). As a\n0\nresult the negative charge state becomes stable in G0 W0 ,\nwhich is not the case in LDA, and has a formation energy\nof 5.53 eV.\nFor the neutral charge state our G0 W0 corrected formation energies compare well with recent DMC calculations that find an average increase of \u223c1.5 eV (with a\nstatitistical error bar of \u00b10.09 eV) and DFT HSE hybrid\nfunctional calculations that significantly reduce the selfinteraction error and yield an average increase of \u223c1.2 eV\n[10]. Earlier DMC calculations give a larger average increase of 1.7 eV compared to the LDA, but also a much\nlarger statistical error bar (\u00b10.48 eV) [9]. Assuming a\nmigration barrier of \u223c0.2 eV [9] our computed activation enthalpy (formation energy + migration barrier) of\n\u223c4.7 eV for the neutral split<110> interstitial is also in\nvery good agreement with the experimentally determined\nvalue of 4.95 eV [24].\nFinally we address the stability of the different defect\nconfigurations when the Fermi energy is varied throughout the band gap (cf Fig. 3).

The lower\npanels show the split<110> as representative configuration\nand the upper the configuration with the lowest energy for a\ngive Fermi level. The dotted line marks the LDA band gap.\n\nonly for the split<110> configuration (lower panels) and\nthe configuration with lowest energy at a given Fermi\nlevel (upper panels). The situation for the hex and\nC3v configurations is qualitatively similar to that of the\nsplit<110>. If each configuration is considered separately, the formation energy diagram looks startlingly\ndifferent in LDA and G0 W0 . Since LDA underestimates\nthe formation energies of the + and 0 state relative\nto the 2+ it does not exhibit the negative-U behavior\nf\nf\nf\n(ED\n(+) > {ED\n(0), ED\n(2+)} for all Fermi energies) observed in G0 W0 . In addition G0 W0 stabilizes the negative charge state for the split<110> interstitial. If, on\nthe other hand, the configuration with the lowest energy\nis considered, LDA and G0 W0 superficially give a more\nsimilar picture: the tetrahedral 2+ state is stable for 6070% of the respective band gaps. While LDA then gives\npreference to the neutral split<110> for larger Fermi levels, the G0 W0 corrections marginally stabilize the neutral\nhex configuration, in agreement with the earlier DMC\ncalculations [9]. The actual energies and transition levels\nbetween LDA and G0 W0 , however, differ appreciably.\nEvery point at which two lines in Fig. 3 cross corresponds to a charge-state transition level \u03b5q/q0 . Bracht\net al. have recently determined these for the silicon\nself-interstitial in high temperature diffusion experiments\n[4]. They identified two levels, at \u2248 0.1-0.2 eV and at\n\u2248 0.4 eV above the valence-band maximum, that they\nascribed to \u03b50/+ and \u03b5+/2+ , respectively. These would\nmost closely correspond to the G0 W0 -corrected chargestate transition levels \u03b50/+ =0.09 eV and \u03b5+/2+ =0.58 eV\nfor the hexagonal configuration or \u03b50/+ =0.05 eV and\n\u03b5+/2+ =0.50 eV for the split<110>, while those of the\nC3v configuration are noticeably different (0.62 eV and\n1.24 eV). Although lowest in formation energy and therefore highest in concentration, the C3v 2+ configuration\n(which is identical to tet 2+) most likely plays a negligible\nrole in the diffusion experiments, since its diffusion would\n\nhave to proceed through a hexagonal site. The activation\nenergy for this process (formation energy + energy barrier at the experimental situation of a Fermi level close\nto the middle of the band gap [4]) would thus be considerably larger than the activation energy for diffusion processes involving the other configurations. Refinements in\nthe diffusion models (e.g. inclusion of multiple configurations and charge-state dependent diffusion barriers) may\nbe able to clarify the role of the tet 2+ configuration in\nfuture experimental studies.\nWe gratefully acknowledge fruitful discussions with K.\nDelaney, C.
