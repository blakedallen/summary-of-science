The pn junction was formed by a surface layer, highly doped by\nboron under thermal diffusion, with a boron concentration\nof about 5\u00d71019 cm\u22123. The diodes with circular and rectangular shapes and sizes equal to (1\u00f710) mm were used in\nthe experiments. The emitting surface of the diode with\nrectangular shape is shown in Figure 1.\n\nSi p-n diode\nc\n\nx\n\n\\\n\na\n\n\\\n\n1 Introduction Nature of high quantum efficiency of\nsilicon light emitting diodes at room temperature is an exciting problem of a large number of researches [1\u221212]. The\ninternal quantum efficiency of electroluminescence of silicon diodes \u03b7 ~ 10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22122 can be explained by the selfcompression of electron-hole plasma into dense plasma\ndrops or plasma flexes with the density of electron-hole\npairs n ~ 1017 \u2212 1018 cm\u22123 [1, 2]. A negative heat capacity\nof electron-hole plasma at the temperatures T \u2265 300 K,\nconcentration of the input diode power inside the plasma\nand weak diffusion of phonons at room temperatures represent the main physical reasons and conditions of the\nplasma condensation [2]. Under these conditions, generation of phonons by the plasma results in a local overheating of the lattice and a reduction of the semiconductor energy gap inside the plasma. In such a way the selforganized potential well, attracting injected electrons and\nholes, is created [2]. At the negative heat capacity of the\nplasma, the plasma self-compression is accompanied by a\ndecrease of plasma energy, observed as a low energy shift\nof the high energy edge of a recombination radiation line\nin electroluminescence spectra with increasing diode current [2]. Here we represent direct evidence of the plasma\nself-compression in silicon p-n light emitting diodes at\nroom temperatures, using results of a surface scanning of\nthe electroluminescence intensity.\n\nd\n\nED\n\nb\n\n.\n\ny metal\n\nFigure 1\n\nThe emitting dots (ED, a, b, c, d) of the silicon p-n\nlight emitting diode before the switching of the EL intensity distribution. The diode area is S = 4\u00d74 mm2.\n\n\fP.D.Altukhov and E.G.Kuzminov: A direct evidence of the self-compression of injected electron-hole plasma in silicon\n\nThe thickness of the silicon layer, highly doped by boron,\nis about 1 micron. The Al strip metal layer with the thickness of the layer about 1 micron and the layer width about\n0.3 mm was made on the emitting surface of the diodes\n(Figure 1). A surface layer, highly doped by phosphorus\nunder thermal diffusion, with a phosphorus concentration\nof about 5\u00d71019 cm\u22123 serves as a metal contact on the back\nside of the diodes. A Ni cover metal layer with a thickness\nof the layer of about 1 micron was made on the back side\nof the diodes. The thickness of the silicon substrates is 0.35\nmm. The gate voltage of the diodes Vg is applied between\nthe top Al strip and the bottom Ni layer.\nThe image of the emitting surface of the diode was focused by lenses on an input slit of a monochromator with\nthe width and height of the slit equal to 0.15 mm. The recombination radiation was detected by a cooled photomultiplier using a photon counting system at a photon energy\nequal to 1.13 eV. The surface scanning of the electroluminescence intensity was produced by a step movement of\nthe image along the slit with the space step equal to 0.1\nmm along the x and y direction. The profiles of the surface\ndistribution of electroluminescence (EL) intensity along\nthe x and y directions are shown in Figure 2.\nThe image of the emitting surface is represented by\nfour emitting dots (Figures 1 and 2), located at the corners\nof the diode, and only two or one of them (a, b) give a\nstrong electroluminescence. The surface distribution of the\nEL intensity appears to be bistable. The profile 2x of the\nEL intensity with the maximum at the dot b switches to the\nprofile 1x with the maximum at the dot a. This is accompanied by a switching of the gate voltage of the diode from\n2.29 V to 2.06 V at the diode current equal to 0.2 A. The\nsurface profile width of the dot emission is defined by light\npropagation along silicon plates and depends on quality of\nthe silicon surface. For surfaces of high quality the profile\nwidth is about 0.7 mm. The minimum profile width, equal\nto 0.3 mm, is achieved for surfaces with a large scale\nroughness.\nThe voltage-current dependences of these diodes show\na monotone increase of the voltage with increasing charge\ncurrent, and we attribute the observed light emission to\nelectron-hole plasma drops [2] with the maximum size\nequal to 0.3 mm at the maximum diode current equal to 0.2\nA. The value of the internal quantum efficiency of the diodes is \u03b7 \u2248 0.03, and the corresponding minimum electronhole density in the drops is n ~ 1017 cm\u22123 [2]. For calculations of the plasma density we use the value of the recombination radiation coefficient A = 3\u00d710\u221215 cm3 s\u22121 [2], obtained by the Roosbroeck and Shockley calculation procedure [13]. A contribution of excitons to the low energy\nedge of the emission line could enhance the value of A by\n1.5 times [14]. But excitons are screened at high plasma\ndensities, and the exciton contribution is assumed to be absent.\nThe conclusion about existence of injected electrons\nand holes in the form of dense plasma drops is supported\nby the electroluminescence spectra of the diodes (Figure 2,\n\nspectra 3, 3'). The strongly shifted to the low energy side\nof the spectrum emission lines of the diodes in comparison\nwith the calculated emission line of rare electron-hole gas\n(Figure 2, spectrum 3\") give evidence of an essential local\noverheating of the lattice inside the plasma drops [2].\na\n\nIs,\na. u.\n\nb\n\n2x\n\n1x\n\na\nb\n\n2x\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\nx, mm\na\n\nIs,\na. u.\n\n1y,2y\n\nc\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\ny, mm\nI,\na. u.\n\n\\\n\n2\n\nIs\n\n3\"\n\n3'\n3\n\n1.3\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n\\\\ 1\nh\u03bd\u03bf\n\n0.9\n\nh\u03bd, eV\n\nFigure 2 Surface distribution of the EL intensity IS\n(1x, 1y, 2x, 2y) at h\u03bd = 1.13 eV for the emitting dots\n(ED, a, b, c) and EL spectra (3, 3', 3\") of the silicon p-n diode.\nx is the distance from the left edge of the diode in the x direction;\ny is the distance from the lower edge of the diode in the y direction (Figure 1).\nThe diode current is Jo = 0.2 A,\nthe diode temperature is T = 320 K,\nthe temperature of the e-h plasma drops is Tg = 440 K.\n1x, 1y: after the switching\nof the EL intensity maximum from the dot b to the dot a;\n2x, 2y: before the switching.\ny = - 0.5 mm for 1x, 2x;\nx = - 0.5 mm for 1y, 2y.\nThe diode voltage Vg is 2.29 V before the switching and\n2.06 V after the switching.\n3, 3': EL spectra after the switching.\n3: at the maximum of the dot a\nfor y = - 0.5 mm, x = - 0.5 mm.\n3': for y = - 0.5 mm, x = - 2.2 mm.\n3\": theory for electron-hole gas at T = 320 K.\nThe arrow IS at the spectrum 3 indicates the photon energy for the\nspace scanning experiments.

The local temperature of plasma drops is Tg = 440 K at the diode\ncurrent Jo = 0.2 A, and the diode temperature outside the\ndrops is T = 320 K. Nevertheless, this significant local\noverheating is not sufficient to explain all features of the\nplasma self-compression, especially, a significant difference between the carrier densities in the drops and outside\nthe drops. We assume that the self-focusing of the injection current in the region of the plasma drops is an additional physical process, necessary for condensation of injected carriers into plasma drops. This self-focusing of the\ninjection current can accompany the plasma selfcompression because of the reduction of the semiconductor\nenergy gap in the region of plasma drops, resulting in a local enhancement of the injection current. Sites of concentration of the injection current can be defined by the potential inhomogeneities. Note, that for some diodes one or two\nplasma drops are located at center of an edge of a diode.\nThe self-focusing of injection current explains a low\ndensity of injected carriers outside the drops with a low\nprobability of radiative recombination An and a very weak\nlight emission from injected carriers outside the drops. The\nemission line 3' in the EL spectrum (Figure 2) is attributed\nto the emitting dot a. Light propagation from the emitting\ndot along the silicon plate results in absorption of light in\nthe high energy part of the spectrum and the corresponding\nnarrowing of the emission line under measurements of the\nspectra at large distances from the emitting drop. A uniform surface distribution of the EL intensity of p-n diodes\nwas obtained with use of integrated emission with a large\ncontribution of the low energy part of the emission line\n[11]. This part of the emission propagates with a low absorption for a long distance, resulting in the observed [11]\nlow resolution of space scanning experiments.\nOur model of the plasma self-compression seems to be\ncorrect for the explanation of presented experimental results. Resent experiments [12] show, that the model of dislocation loops [3, 4], concentrating injected carriers near a\np-n junction, is not available for explanation of the high\nquantum efficiency of silicon diodes. Defects, introduced\nby boron implantation and used as a cause of the high\nquantum efficiency of silicon diodes [9, 10], are absent in\nour diodes.\n3 Conclusion The results of our experiments can\nnot be explained by the simple Shockley diffusion model\nof the p-n junction current, considered in Ref [8]. The concentration of the electroluminescence intensity in small\nemitting dots on the diode surface, defined by the concentration of injected carriers in dense plasma drops, and the\nlow energy shift of the emission line serve as direct evidence of the self-compression of injected carriers in silicon\np-n light emitting diodes. The introduced self-focusing of\ninjection current can represent an essential feature of the\n\n3\n\nphenomenon, necessary for the realization of high-contrast\nimages of the surface distribution of light emission.\nReferences\n[1] P.
