[2] At the same time, the adhesion between multi-component\nbio-membranes or biomimetic membranes is also intimately related to domain formation. [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] When the membrane adhesion is mediated by the specific lockand-key type of bonds between the anchored ligands and receptors, i.e., junctions, adhesioninduced lateral phase separations have been observed in many experiments in biomimetic\nsystems [3, 4, 5]. Theoretical models and Monte Carlo simulations [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] have\nalso shown similar phase separation behavior in various systems.\nSo far, studies on adhesion-induced lateral phase separation have focused on the case when\nthe system has a single type of junctions. The presence of the glycol proteins anchored in the\nmembranes (i.e., repellers), and the interplay between generic interactions (for example, Van\nder Waals, or electrostatic interactions) and specific ligand/receptor interactions are believed\nto enhance this phase separation. However, in biological systems membrane adhesion are\noften mediated by more than one type of junctions, and the adhesion-induced junction\nseparation are believed to play an important role in some biological processes. For example,\na key event governing a mature immune response when T lymphocytes interact with antigenpresent cells is the formation of immunological synapses. An immunological synapse is a\npatch of membrane adhesion region between a T cell and an antigen-present cell, where the\nTCR/MHC-peptide complexes aggregate in the center with a LFA-1/ICAM-1 complexes rich\nregion surrounds it. [12, 13, 14] Since a complete understanding of the physical mechanism\nbehind this type of adhesion-induced multi-species membrane junction separation is still\nunavailable, in the present work I develop a theoretical model to study the equilibrium\nproperties of such systems.\nThis article is organized as follows. In section II, I discuss a coarse grained model for\nthe adhesion of two membranes due to the formation of two types of junctions. To concentrate on the effect of the differences between type-1 and type-2 junctions, the glycocalyx\nand the generic interactions between the membranes are not considered in this model. Fur2\n\n\fthermore, I assume that the membranes are bound to each other due to the formation of\nthe membrane junctions. Hence I will not discuss another interesting problem of the unbinding transition. An approximate solution of this model which neglects the fluctuations\nof membrane-membrane distance (the \"hard membrane\" solution) is studied in section III.\nThis simplified solution already reveals several mechanisms which are important to the phase\nbehavior of the system. For example, when type-1 and type-2 junctions have the same rigidity, membrane adhesion can induce a junction separation which is driven by the height\ndifference of the junctions. In this situation the membranes separate into a type-1-junctionrich domain and a type-2-junction-rich domain. On the other hand, when the junctions have\ndifferent rigidities and the height difference is not very large, membrane adhesion can induce\nan aggregation of the \"softer\" junctions, i.e., the membranes can separate into two domains\nwhich are both rich in the softer junctions. Thus, in general situations both mechanisms\ncontribute to the adhesion-induced junction separation. When phase separation occurs, the\nsystem separates into two domains with different membrane-membrane distance because of\nthe height mismatch of the junctions, and the total number of the softer junctions in the\nsystem is greater than the total number of the stiffer junctions.\nThe fact that the hard membrane solution assumes that the membrane-membrane distance is a constant has its drawback, too. An apparent artifact of the hard membrane\nsolution is that when junction separation occurs, the total junction density, i.e., \u03c61 + \u03c62\n(\u03c6\u03b1 is the density of type-\u03b1 junctions), is the same in domains which have different values\nof (\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )/(\u03c61 + \u03c62 ) (the relative densities of the junctions)! This artifact also shows\nthat, in order to acquire a complete physical picture of the junction separation, the effect of\nnon-constant membrane-membrane distance, and the thermally activated fluctuations of the\nmembranes and junction densities should be taken into account. Therefore in section IV I\nstudy the effects of these fluctuations. The fluctuation analysis shows that, first, the thermally activated membrane fluctuations renormalize the chemical potentials of the junctions,\nand effectively reduce the binding energies of the junctions. This chemical potential renormalization is less significant for the softer junctions because they allow the membranes more\nfreedom to move. Second, the fluctuation analysis also reveals nonlocal interactions between\nthe junctions which are mediated by the membrane elasticity and thermally activated fluctuations of the junction densities and membrane-membrane distance . These interactions\nare not included in the simple physical picture provided by the hard membrane solution.\n3\n\n\fAs a result of these effects, when junction separation occurs, domains with different values\nof (\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )/(\u03c61 + \u03c62 ) also have different values of \u03c61 + \u03c62 . The fluctuation analysis also\nshows that, when the hard membrane solution of the junction densities are small, or when\nthe junctions are very short or very soft, the membrane fluctuations are sufficiently large\nsuch that the present analysis cannot provide the complete physical picture for the system.\nThis criterion shows under what conditions one needs a numerical simulation of the model\nto provide a better picture of the physics in this system. Section V summarizes this work.\nThe Appendix discusses the details of the fluctuation analysis around the hard membrane\nsolution.\n\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nTo focus on the physics of adhesion-induced phase separation, I will not discuss the\nbinding/unbinding transition but only consider the case when the membranes are bound to\neach other due to the presence of the junctions. The system is shown schematically in Fig. 1.\nThe heights of the membranes measured from the reference plane (i.e., the xy-plane) are\ndenoted as z1 (r) and z2 (r), respectively, where r = (x, y) is a two-dimensional planar vector.\nThere are two types of anchored receptors in membrane 1, and two types of anchored ligands\nin membrane 2. Type-\u03b1 receptors (\u03b1 is 1 or 2) form specific lock-and-key complexes with\ntype-\u03b1 ligands, these are the junctions which mediate the membrane adhesion. The density\nof type-\u03b1 junctions at r is \u03c6\u03b1 (r), and the densities of free type-\u03b1 receptors and ligands at r\nare denoted by \u03c8R\u03b1 (r) and \u03c8L\u03b1 (r), respectively. The binding energy of a type-\u03b1 junction is\ndenoted by EB\u03b1 .\nThe effective Hamiltonian of the system can be written as\nH=\n\nZ\n\n2\n2\n\u00112\nX\nX\n\u03ba\u0010 2\n\u03bb\u03b1\n\u03b3\nd2 r\n\u03c6\u03b1 EB\u03b1 .\n\u2207 h(r) + (\u2207h(r))2 +\n\u03c6\u03b1 (r) (h(r) \u2212 h\u03b1 )2 \u2212\n2\n2\n\u03b1=1 2\n\u03b1=1\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(1)\n\nThe energy unit is chosen to be kB T . Here h(r) = z1 (r) \u2212 z2 (r) is the membrane-membrane\ndistance at r. The first and second terms on the right hand side are the bending elastic energy\nand surface tension of the membranes. \u03ba is related to the bending moduli of the membranes\nby \u03ba = \u03ba1 \u03ba2 /(\u03ba1 + \u03ba2 ) [15] , and \u03b3 is related to the surface tension of the membranes by\n\u03b3 = \u03b31 \u03b32 /(\u03b31 + \u03b32 ) [15]. In this simple model it is assumed that \u03ba and \u03b3 are independent of\nthe densities of the receptors and ligands anchored in the membranes. I also assume that in\n4\n\n\fthe presence of a type-\u03b1 junction, the interaction energy between the membranes acquires\na minimum at h = h\u03b1 (the natural height of a type-\u03b1 junction), and the coupling term\nP2\n\n\u03bb\u03b1\n\u03b1=1 2 \u03c6\u03b1 (r) (h(r)\n\n\u2212 h\u03b1 )2 comes from the Taylor expansion around this minimum. Here\n\n\u03bb\u03b1 is the rigidity of a type-\u03b1 junction against stretch or compression. The last term on\nthe right hand side is the binding energy between the receptors and the ligands. To focus\non the effect of adhesion-induced interactions, I have neglected all the direct interactions\nbetween the junctions, receptors, and ligands. The nonspecific interactions between the\nmembranes are also neglected. For simplicity, from now on I further choose the unit length\n\u221a\nin the xy-plane to be a, where a is the in-plane size of an inclusion, and the unit length\nin the z-direction is chosen to be\n\nq\n\na/\u03ba \u2261 l0 . Thus the Hamiltonian of the system can be\n\nexpressed in the non-dimensional form,\nH=\n\nZ\n\n2\n2\n\u00112\nX\nX\n\u039b\u03b1\n\u0393\n1\u0010 2\n\u03c6\u03b1 EB\u03b1 ,\n\u2207 h(r) + (\u2207h(r))2 +\n\u03c6\u03b1 (r) (h(r) \u2212 h\u03b1 )2 \u2212\ndr\n2\n2\n\u03b1=1 2\n\u03b1=1\n2\n\n)\n\n(\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u0393 = \u03b3l02 is the dimensionless surface tension, \u039b\u03b1 = \u03bb\u03b1 l02 is the dimensionless junction\nq\n\u221a\nrigidity, and all in-plane lengths and heights are scaled by a and a/\u03ba \u2261 l0 , respectively.\nThe effective interaction free energy between the junctions due to the membrane-junction\n\ncoupling is obtained by integrating over h(r),\nFc [\u03c6\u03b1 ] = \u2212 ln\n\n\u0012Z\n\n\u2212H[h,\u03c6\u03b1 ]\n\nD[h]e\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nThus in the spirit of density functional theory, the total free energy of the system is provided\nby\nF = Fc + Fs ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere\nFs =\n\n2 Z\nX\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nd2 r (\u03c6\u03b1 (r)(ln \u03c6\u03b1 \u2212 1) + \u03c8R\u03b1 (r)(ln \u03c8R\u03b1 \u2212 1) + \u03c8L\u03b1 (r)(ln \u03c8L\u03b1 \u2212 1))\n\n(5)\n\nis the contribution from the entropy of the junctions, receptors and ligands. Here I have\nassumed that \u03c6\u03b1 \u226a 1, \u03c8R\u03b1 \u226a 1, and \u03c8L\u03b1 \u226a 1. In principle, once Fc is calculated, the\nequilibrium distribution of the junction density is determined by minimizing the total free\nenergy of the system under the constraint that the total numbers of the receptors and ligands\nin the system are fixed, i.e,\nZ\n\nZ\n\nd2 r {\u03c6\u03b1 (r) + \u03c8R\u03b1 (r)} = NR\u03b1 ,\nd2 r {\u03c6\u03b1 (r) + \u03c8L\u03b1 (r)} = NL\u03b1 ,\n5\n\n(6)\n\n\fhere NR\u03b1 and NL\u03b1 are the total number of type-\u03b1 receptors and ligands in each membranes\nwhen the membranes are completely detached.\n\nIII.\n\n\"HARD MEMBRANE\" SOLUTION\n\nSince the integral in Eq. (3) cannot be carried out exactly, in this section I discuss an\napproximate solution in which \u03c6\u03b1 and h(r) are independent of r. In this approximation, Fc\ncan be easily calculated by looking for the saddle point in the integrand. This is equivalent\nto neglecting the fluctuations of the membrane-membrane distance, therefore I call this\nmean-field approximate solution the \"hard membrane\" solution. To simplify the notation,\nI define \u039b\u00b1 = \u039b1 \u00b1 \u039b2 , \u03c6\u00b1 = (\u03c61 \u00b1 \u03c62 )/2, and let h1 = h0 \u2212 \u25b3h , h2 = h0 + \u25b3h . Thus the\nhard membrane solution of the membrane-membrane distance can be expressed by\n\u039b\u2212 \u03c6+ + \u039b+ \u03c6\u2212\n\u25b3h\n\u039b+ \u03c6+ + \u039b\u2212 \u03c6\u2212\n\u2261 h0 \u2212 lM .\n\nh = h0 \u2212\n\n(7)\n\nNotice that lM depends on the junction densities. After substituting h back to the Hamiltonian, the effective interaction free energy between the junctions, Fc , can be expressed by\nits saddle-point value\nFc =\n\nZ\n\n)\n\n(\n\n\u0011\n\u039b+ \u03c6+ + \u039b\u2212 \u03c6\u2212 \u0010 2\nlM + \u25b32h + (\u039b\u2212 \u03c6+ + \u039b+ \u03c6\u2212 ) lM \u25b3h \u2212 (E+ \u03c6+ + E\u2212 \u03c6\u2212 ) , (8)\ndr\n2\n2\n\nwhere E\u00b1 = EB1 \u00b1 EB2 . It is clear that there is an interaction between the junctions due to\nthe membrane adhesion. To minimize the total free energy under the constraints in Eq. (6),\nit is convenient to work in the grand canonical ensemble and define the free energy G of the\nsystem under constant chemical potentials,\nG = Fc + Fs \u2212\n\nX\n\u03b1\n\n\u03bcR\u03b1\n\nZ\n\n2\n\nd r(\u03c6\u03b1 + \u03c8R\u03b1 ) \u2212\n\nX\n\u03b1\n\n\u03bcL\u03b1\n\nZ\n\nd2 r(\u03c6\u03b1 + \u03c8L\u03b1 ).\n\n(9)\n\nThe chemical potentials, \u03bcR\u03b1 , \u03bcL\u03b1 are determined by fixing the total number of receptors\nand ligands in the system. However, for convenience I will proceed the discussion in the\ngrand canonical ensemble. After some straightforward algebra, G is expressed as\nG=\n\nZ\n\nd2 r \u03c6+ {g(\u03c6) + 2 (ln \u03c6+ \u2212 1) \u2212 \u03bc+ } + G\u03c8 ,\n\n6\n\n(10)\n\n\fwhere\n\u25b32h\n(\u03bb + \u03c6)2\n\u039b+\n+ (1 + \u03c6) ln (1 + \u03c6) + (1 \u2212 \u03c6) ln (1 \u2212 \u03c6) \u2212 \u03bc\u2212 \u03c6\n2\n1 + \u03bb\u03c6\n\u2261 f (\u03c6) \u2212 \u03bc\u2212 \u03c6,\n\ng(\u03c6) = \u2212\n\n\u03bb \u2261 \u039b\u2212 /\u039b+ , \u03c6 \u2261 \u03c6\u2212 /\u03c6+ , and \u03bc\u00b1 = (\u03bcR1 + \u03bcL1 ) \u00b1 (\u03bcR2 + \u03bcL2 ) + EB1 \u00b1 EB2 \u2212\n\n(11)\n\u25b32h\n\u039b\u00b1 .\n2\n\nG\u03c8 includes terms which only depend on \u03c8R\u03b1 and \u03c8L\u03b1 , they are decoupled from the other\nterms, hence from now on I neglect G\u03c8 . From Eq. (10), it is clear that in the hard membrane\nsolution the phase behavior of the junctions is governed by \u25b32h \u039b+ , \u03bb, and \u03bc\u00b1 . Minimizing\ng(\u03c6) leads to the equilibrium value of \u03c6, and later I will show that there can be a phase\nseparation in \u03c6. On the other hand, from Eq. (10), \u03c6+ satisfies\n1\n1\n\u03c6+ = exp \u03bc+ \u2212 g(\u03c6) .\n2\n2\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n(12)\n\nBecause in equilibrium \u03c6 is determined by minimizing g(\u03c6), g(\u03c6) takes single value even\nwhen there is a phase separation in \u03c6. Therefore in the hard membrane solution \u03c6+ is\nsingle-valued even when the system separates into two domains with different values of\n\u03c6! In the next section I will show that, when the effects of fluctuations around the hard\nmembrane solution are taken into account, the analysis reveals a renormalization of the\nbinding energy of the junctions and (nonlocal) interactions between the junctions which\nare mediated by the membrane elasticities and thermally activated membrane fluctuations.\nAs a result, the true equilibrium solution of \u03c6+ is not single-valued in the regime where\njunction separation happens. Thus, the fact that \u03c6+ is single-valued in the hard membrane\nsolution is an artifact of the approximation which assumes constant junction densities and\nmembrane-membrane distance.\nNow I discuss the hard membrane solution of \u03c6. To emphasize different roles played by\n\u25b32h \u039b+ and \u03bb, I begin the discussion with the special case when \u03bb = 0, i.e., when both types\nof junctions have the same rigidities. In this case the important parameter of the theory is\n\u25b32h \u039b+ , and g(\u03c6) has a very simple form\ng(\u03c6) = \u2212\n\n\u25b32h \u039b+ 2\n\u03c6 + (1 + \u03c6) ln (1 + \u03c6) + (1 \u2212 \u03c6) ln (1 \u2212 \u03c6) \u2212 \u03bc\u2212 \u03c6.\n2\n\n(13)\n\nThis form is exactly the same as the Flory-Huggins theory for binary mixtures [17], where\nphase separation occurs when \u25b32h \u039b+ > 2 and the phase coexistence curve is a straight line\n\nat \u03bc\u2212 = 0. This phase coexistence curve ends at a critical point \u03bc\u2212 = 0, \u25b32h \u039b+ = 2. The\n7\n\n\fphysics in this special case \u03bb = 0 is clear: the difference in junction height drives a junction\nseparation, and this separation only occurs when the factor \u25b32h \u039b+ , a combination of junction\nheight difference and junction rigidity, is sufficiently large. On the phase coexistence curve,\nthe system separates into \u03c61 -rich and \u03c62 -rich domains, and the system is symmetric under\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u2212\u03c6.\nNext I discuss the more general case \u03bb 6= 0, i.e., the junctions have different rigidities.\n\nFig. 2 shows the shape of g(\u03c6) with different values of \u03bc\u2212 when \u03bb = 0.2 and \u25b32h \u039b+ = 1.998.\n\nNotice that this is the case when \u25b32h \u039b+ < 2, i.e., there is no junction separation if \u03bb = 0.\nNevertheless, Fig. 2 clearly shows that g(\u03c6) has two local minimum, both at negative \u03c6, and\nphase coexistence occurs when \u03bc\u2212 \u2248 \u22120.4045. Since this is the case when \u03bb > 0, i.e., type-2\njunctions are \"softer\" than type-1 junctions, double minimum at \u03c6 = \u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 < 0 means\nthat the softer junctions tend to aggregate, when phase coexistence occurs a domain with\nhigh \u03c62 \u2212 \u03c61 coexists with a domain with small \u03c62 \u2212 \u03c61 . The density of type-2 junctions is\nhigher than the density of type-1 junctions in both domains.\nAnother effect of nonzero \u03bb can be seen in Fig. 3 , where g(\u03c6) for different values of\n\u03bb is shown at \u25b32h \u039b+ = 2.04 > 2. It shows that g(\u03c6) is symmetric in \u03c6 when \u03bb = 0 but\nasymmetric in \u03c6 for nonzero \u03bb, i.e., the symmetry under \u03c6 \u2192 \u2212\u03c6 no longer exists when the\njunctions have different rigidities. Comparing to \u03bb = 0 case, in the case when \u03bb > 0, the\nminima of g(\u03c6) are shifted towards smaller \u03c6 values, i.e., the softer junctions are easier to be\nformed. Notice that different from the example in Fig. 2, in Fig. 3 when phase coexistence\noccurs the membranes separate into \u03c61 -rich and \u03c62 -rich domains, but the softer junctions\n(in this case type-2 junctions) are the \"favored\" species, i.e., the total number of the softer\njunctions in the system is greater than the total number of the stiffer junctions. From these\ntwo examples of nonzero \u03bb, I conclude that in general the experimentally observed junction\nseparation induced by membrane adhesion is actually a result of the combined effect of the\naggregation of softer junctions and the separation of the junctions due to the mismatch of\njunction heights.\nIn the neighborhood of \u25b32h \u039b+ = 2, \u03bb = 0, the equilibrium value of \u03c6 is small compared to\nunity, therefore the phase diagram of the system in this regime can be studied by expanding\ng(\u03c6) around \u03c6 = 0,\ng(\u03c6) = r2 \u03c62 + r3 \u03c63 + r4 \u03c64 \u2212 \u03bc\u0303\u2212 \u03c6 + const. + O(\u03c65 ),\n8\n\n(14)\n\n\fr2 = 1 \u2212\n\n\u00112\n\u0010\n\u25b32h\n\u039b + 1 \u2212 \u03bb2 ,\n2\n\n\u00112\n\u0010\n\u25b32h\n\u039b + \u03bb 1 \u2212 \u03bb2 ,\n2\n\u00112\n\u0010\n1 \u25b32\nr4 = \u2212 h \u039b + \u03bb 2 1 \u2212 \u03bb 2 ,\n6\n2\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u25b32\n\u03bc\u0303\u2212 = \u03bc\u2212 + h \u039b+ \u03bb 2 \u2212 \u03bb2 ,\n2\n2\n\u25b3\nconst. = h \u039b+ \u03bb2 ,\n2\n\nr3 =\n\n(15)\n\nand O(\u03c65 ) is the contribution from terms of order \u03c65 and higher. The phase diagram in\nthe neighborhood of \u25b32h \u039b+ = 2, \u03bb = 0 is plotted schematically in Fig. 4. where the phase\n\ncoexistence curve for \u03bb = 0 ends at a critical point \u25b32h \u039b+ = 2, \u03bc\u2212 = 0, and the end\npoints of the phase coexistence curves for \u03bb 6= 0 occurs at the triple root of \u2202g/\u2202\u03c6 = 0.\nStraightforward calculation leads to the position of the end points of the phase coexistence\ncurves at\n\u25b32h \u039b+ = 2(1 \u2212 9\u03bb2 /4) + O(\u03bb4 ),\n\u03bc\u2212 = \u22122\u03bb + O(\u03bb3 ).\n\n(16)\n\nThis shows how the smallest value of \u25b32h \u039b+ above which phase separation can occur decreases\nas the difference of junction rigidities increases. The phase coexistence curves move towards\nthe \u03bb = 0 phase boundary as the value of\n\n\u25b32h\n\u039b+\n2\n\nincreases. This is because as\n\n\u25b32h\n\u039b+\n2\n\nincreases,\n\nthe effect of junction height mismatch becomes more important, and the difference in the\njunction rigidities becomes less important.\nAlthough the hard membrane solution is a very simplified analysis of the model, it nevertheless reveals interesting physics of the junction separation due to membrane adhesion.\nFirst of all, the height difference between different types of junctions is not the only factor\nwhich is important for the junction distribution. It is only when the rigidities of both types\nof junctions are the same that the difference in the junction height is the most important\nfactor in the junction separation. If the system consists of junctions with different rigidities,\nthe softer junctions are more favored, and the junction separation is a result of the interplay\nbetween the aggregation of the softer junctions and the separation of the junctions due to\nthe height difference. Therefore the smallest value of \u25b32h \u039b+ above which phase separation\ncan occur is smaller for systems with larger |\u03bb|. However, the approximations in the hard\n9\n\n\fmembrane solution lead to the surprising result that \u03c6+ is the same in both domains when\njunction separation occurs. This indicates that analysis which includes the elasticity of the\nmembranes and the thermal fluctuations around the hard membrane solution is very much\nneeded for a full understanding of the nature of the membrane adhesion-induced interactions\nbetween the junctions.\n\nIV.\n\nBEYOND \"HARD MEMBRANE\" SOLUTION\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, the hard membrane solution neglects the effects of\nnonuniform membrane-membrane distance and junction densities, therefore fails to take the\neffects of membrane-mediated nonlocal interactions between the junctions into account. The\nresult is reflected in the unrealistic solution of single valued \u03c6+ in both domains when phase\ncoexistence occurs. To study these membrane-mediated effects, in this section I include the\nfluctuations of membrane-membrane distance and junction densities by expanding the free\nenergy of the system around the hard membrane solution. In the following I denote the true\nmembrane-membrane distance as\nh(r) = h0 + lM + \u03b4l(r) \u2261 hM + \u03b4l(r),\n\n(17)\n\nand the densities of the junctions are expressed by\n\u03c6\u03b1 = \u03c6\u03b1M + \u03b4\u03c6(r).\n\n(18)\n\nHere \u03b4l, \u03b4\u03c6\u03b1 are the deviations of the true values of h and \u03c6\u03b1 from their hard membrane\nsolutions, \u03c6\u03b1M and hM are the hard membrane solution of \u03c6\u03b1 (r) and h(r), respectively. In\nthis expansion, the coarse grained Hamiltonian can be expressed as\nH = HM + H0 + H1 + H\u03c6 ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere HM is H(hM , \u03c61M , \u03c62M ),\nH0 =\n\nZ\n\nd2 r\n\n\u001a\n\n1 2 2 1\n(\u2207 \u03b4l) + \u0393(\u2207\u03b4l)2 + [lM (\u039b1 \u03b4\u03c61 + \u039b2 \u03b4\u03c62 ) + \u25b3h (\u039b1 \u03b4\u03c61 \u2212 \u039b2 \u03b4\u03c62 )] \u03b4l (20)\n2\n2\n\u001b\n\nincludes terms which are bilinear in \u03b4l and \u03b4\u03c6\u03b1 ,\n1\nH1 =\n2\n\nZ\n\nd2 r(\u039b1 \u03b4\u03c61 + \u039b2 \u03b4\u03c62 )(\u03b4l)2\n10\n\n(21)\n\n\fis the nonlinear coupling between \u03b4l and \u03b4\u03c6\u03b1 , and H\u03c6 includes terms which are linear in\n\u03b4\u03c6\u03b1 .\nFirst I discuss the contribution from H0 , i.e., the Gaussian fluctuations around the hard\nmembrane solution. In this Gaussian approximation, Fc has acquired two correction terms\nwhich can be expressed by\n\u2212\n\nX |lM \u03b4m+ (q) + \u25b3h \u03b4m\u2212 (q)|2\n2\u03c0\n1X\n\u2212\n,\nln 4\n2 q\nq + \u0393q 2 + m+\nq 4 + \u0393q 2 + m+\nq\n\n(22)\n\nfor convenience I have defined m\u00b1 = \u039b1 \u03c61M \u00b1 \u039b2 \u03c62M , and \u03b4m\u00b1 = \u039b1 \u03b4\u03c61 \u00b1 \u039b2 \u03b4\u03c62 . The\nfirst term is independent of \u03b4\u03c6\u03b1 , therefore I neglect it in the rest of the discussion. The\nsecond term is a membrane-mediated nonlocal interaction between the junctions. This\n\u22121/4\n\ninteraction has two characteristic lengths: m+\n\nis the distance it takes for a perturbation\n\nin membrane-membrane distance to relax back to its hard membrane solution due to the\nmembrane bending rigidity, another length is \u0393\u22121/2 , for lengths greater than \u0393\u22121/2 the\nelasticity of the membrane is dominated by the surface tension of the membrane, and the\ncontribution from the bending rigidity is negligible. In the rest of this article, I focus on\n\u221a\nthe case when \u0393 < m+ , in which the membrane bending rigidity is the dominant effect\nwhich drives a perturbation in h back to hM , thus the contribution from surface tension\nof the membranes is negligible. To understand the nature of the nonlocal interaction, it is\nconvenient to transform the second term to real space. Calculations in the Appendix show\n\u221a\nthat, when \u0393 < m+ , the second term in the real space has the form which is derived in\nEq. (33)\n\u2212\n\nZ\n\n2\n\ndr\n\nZ\n\n\u25b32\n1/4\nd r \u221ah G(|r \u2212 r\u2032 |m+ )\n8\u03c0 m+\n2 \u2032\n\n\u00d7\n\n\"\n\n\"\n\n!\n\n!\n\nm\u2212\nm\u2212\n\u039b1 \u03b4\u03c61 (r) \u2212 1 +\n\u039b2 \u03b4\u03c62 (r)\n1\u2212\nm+\nm+\n!\n\n!\n\n#\n\n#\n\nm\u2212\nm\u2212\n1\u2212\n\u039b1 \u03b4\u03c61 (r\u2032 ) \u2212 1 +\n\u039b2 \u03b4\u03c62 (r\u2032 ) , (23)\nm+\nm+\n\nwhere G(x) is a MeijerG function [18]. G(x) is vanishingly small for x \u2265 5. Eq. (23) shows\nthat this membrane-mediated interaction is attractive between junctions of the same type,\nand repulsive between junctions of different types. This interaction is short-ranged with a\n\u22121/4\n\ncharacteristic length m+\n\n. Also notice that the contribution from H1 is proportional to\n\n\u25b32h , i.e., there is no membrane-mediated interactions in the level of Gaussian approximations\nwhen the junctions have the same height. The physical picture of this interaction can be seen\nfrom Fig. 5. A small perturbation of the junction density from the hard membrane solution\n11\n\n\finduces a deviation of membrane-membrane distance from hM , and there is a membrane\nbending energy associated with any given distribution of non-uniform membrane-membrane\ndistance. To reduce the bending energy, a region with positive \u03b4\u03c61(2) attracts a region with\npositive \u03b4\u03c61(2) in order to reduce the elastic energy cost of a \"pit\" or a \"bump\" between\nthese two regions due to the non-uniform h(r). Similarly, a region with positive \u03b4\u03c61 repels a\nregion with positive \u03b4\u03c62 , in order to reduce the bending energy cost due to the high curvature\nconfiguration between these two regions. This also explains the fact that these interactions\nvanish when both types of junctions have the same height, i.e., \u25b3h = 0. A similar kind of\nmembrane-mediated nonlocal interaction between the junctions is discussed in the celebrated\narticle by Bruinsma, Goulian, and Pincus [19], where in their \"van der Waals regime\", the\ncompetition between the potential minimum due to the van der Waals interaction between\nthe membranes and another potential minimum due to the stiff membrane junctions results\nin a strong interaction between the junctions. Although there is only one type of junctions in\nthe system discussed in Ref. [19], the interaction between the junctions in Ref. [19] and the\npresent case share the same physical mechanism, i.e., the bending elasticity of the membranes\nmediates this interaction.\nAnother type of nonlocal interactions between the junctions can be studied by considering the effect of nonlinear couplings between \u03b4l and \u03b4\u03c6\u03b1 . This is done by including the\ncontributions form H1 perturbatively to one loop order. The resulting effective interaction\nfree energy between the junctions, Fc , now has the form\nFc = FM + FG + Floop + H\u03c6 ,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere FM is the hard membrane solution of Fc , FG is the contribution from terms which are\nbilinear in \u03b4l and \u03b4\u03c6\u03b1 , and Floop is the contribution from the nonlinear couplings between\n\u03b4l and \u03b4\u03c6\u03b1 to one loop order. The details of the calculations for Floop is discussed in the\n\u221a\nAppendix. When \u0393 < m+ , the result (up to terms quadratic in \u03b4\u03c6\u03b1 ) is provided by\nEq. (35), Eq. (37), and Eq. (39),\nFloop =\n\n1\nd2 r(\u039b1\u03b4\u03c61 + \u039b2 \u03b4\u03c62 )\n\u221a\n16 m+\nZ\nd2 q\n1\n1\n|\u039b1 \u03b4\u03c61 (q) + \u039b2 \u03b4\u03c62 (q)|2 .\n\u2212 \u221a\n2\n4\n16 m+ (2\u03c0) q + 4m+\nZ\n\n(25)\n\nHere the first term is a \"renormalization\" of the chemical potentials of the junctions due to\nmembrane fluctuations. This term effectively reduces the binding energies of the junctions.\n12\n\n\fThe fact that the renormalization of the chemical potential for the softer junctions is less\nsignificant compared to that for the stiffer junctions is because the membrane fluctuations\nare energetically less costly for the softer junctions. The second term is a fluctuation-induced\nnonlocal interaction between the junctions, and higher order terms are neglected. Notice\nthat, as discussed in the Appendix, the second term in Eq. (25) is actually an approximate\nform of the much more complicated true result, it provides the correct asymptotic behavior\n\u221a\nof the true result at large and small q limits in the case when \u0393 < m+ . Similar to\nthe case of Gaussian approximation, when the fluctuation-induced interaction between the\njunctions is expressed in real space, one finds that the interaction between the junctions is\n\u22121/4\n\nnonlocal, short-ranged, and has a characteristic length on the order of m+\n\n. Since Floop is\n\nnon-vanishing even when \u25b3h = 0, it is clear that the thermal fluctuations of the membranemembrane distance is the mechanism which induces the nonlocal interactions between the\njunctions in Floop . This is similar but not the same as the interaction between the junctions\nin the \"Helfrich regime\" discussed in Ref. [19]. In Ref. [19], the interaction between the\njunctions in the Helfrich regime comes from the collisions between the membranes. Here in\nthe one-loop calculation the interaction between the junctions comes from the fluctuations\nof the membrane-membrane distance around the hard membrane solution, the effect of\nmembrane collisions is not included.\nWhen the fluctuations around the hard membrane solution are taken into account to\none-loop order, the total free energy of the system to second order in \u03b4\u03c6\u03b1 can be expressed\nby\nF = FM +\n\nZ\n\nd2 q\n(2\u03c0)2\n\n2\nX\n\n1\n|\u03b4\u03c6\u03b1(q)|2\n2\u03c6\n\u03b1M\n\u03b1=1\n\n!\n\nm\u2212\nm\u2212\nd2 q\n\u25b32h\n\u2212\n1\n\u2212\n\u039b\n\u03b4\u03c6\n(q)\n\u2212\n1\n+\n\u039b2 \u03b4\u03c62 (q)\n1\n1\n(2\u03c0)2 q 4 + m+\nm+\nm+\nZ\n1\nd2 q\n1\n\u2212\n|\u039b1 \u03b4\u03c61 (q) + \u039b2 \u03b4\u03c62 (q)|2\n\u221a\n2\n4\n16 m+ (2\u03c0) q + 4m+\nZ\n1\n+\nd2 r(\u039b1 \u03b4\u03c61 + \u039b2 \u03b4\u03c62 ).\n\u221a\n16 m+\n!\n\nZ\n\n!\n\n2\n\n(26)\n\nHere the first term on the right hand side is the hard membrane solution, the second term\ncomes from the entropy of the junctions, the third term is the nonlocal interaction between\nthe junctions due to Gaussian fluctuations, the fourth and the fifth terms come from the\nnonlinear couplings between \u03b4l and \u03b4\u03c6\u03b1 . Notice that the contribution from H\u03c6 does not\n13\n\n\fappear in the total free energy of the system, it cancels with the linear terms in the expansion\nof the entropy of the junctions. This is because \u03c6\u03b1M minimizes the hard-membrane free\nenergy, therefore in the expansion around the hard-membrane solution terms which are\nlinear in \u03b4\u03c6 cancel with each other. The contribution from one-loop calculation, however,\nincludes terms which are linear in \u03b4\u03c6\u03b1 because they come from the nonlinear couplings\nbetween \u03b4\u03c6\u03b1 and \u03b4l. An important consequence of the presence of these terms is that in\ngeneral the equilibrium values of \u03b4\u03c61 and \u03b4\u03c62 are nonzero due to the membrane fluctuations.\nTherefore when a phase separation occurs, the values of \u03c61 + \u03c62 are different in domains\nwith different values of \u03c6.\nTo discuss the correction of \u03c6\u03b1 and h(r) due to the thermally activated fluctuations, it is\nconvenient to express Eq.

This rather complicated expression shows that, besides\n\n\u03bc\u2212 , \u03bb, and \u25b32h \u039b+ , the answer to the question of which domain has higher total junction\n\ndensity when the phase coexistence occurs also depends on the values of \u25b32h and \u03c6\u03b1M (to\ndetermine \u03c6\u03b1M , one needs to know the value of \u03bc+ )! In this article I shall not discuss the\ndetails of the values of \u03c61 + \u03c62 for different given parameters in the theory, but simply\ncomment that when det M is positive, the phase diagram of the hard membrane solution is\n14\n\n\fnot modified by the thermal fluctuations. However, when det M < 0, the hard membrane\nsolution is not stable at any finite temperature. The result in Eq. (29) also provides some\ncriteria for the current analysis. For example, when the fluctuations are large, the deviation\nfrom hard membrane solution can no longer be treated by perturbation theory. This is\ntrue when \u03b4\u03c6\u03b1 /\u03c6\u03b1 \u223c O(1). Since \u03b4\u03c6\u03b1 becomes large for small det M, which occurs at\nsmall m+ = \u039b1 \u03c61M + \u039b2 \u03c62M , I conclude that the perturbation theory breaks down at\nsmall junction densities. Finally, I point out that the collisions between the membranes are\nalso neglected in the present analysis, this approximation is valid when the fluctuations of\nmembrane-membrane distance is not large, i.e., when\nq\n\n< (\u03b4l)2 >0\nhM\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nd2 q\n1\n2\n4\n(2\u03c0) q + m+\n\n!1/2\n\n1\n1\n\u2264 O(1).\n\u2248\n1/4\nhM\n4m+ hM\n\n(30)\n\n1/4\n\nIn the regime where m+ hM = (\u039b1 \u03c61M + \u039b2 \u03c62M )1/4 hM \u2264 O(1), i.e., when the junction\ndensities are small, or the when junctions are very soft, or when the junctions are very\n\"short\", the contributions from membrane collisions should be taken into account for a\ncomplete analysis of this system. Thus, when the membrane fluctuations or the membrane\ncollisions become important, numerical simulations [20] or other methods which take the full\nmembrane fluctuations into account should be applied to study the physics of this system.\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nI have discussed the phase separation of multiple species membrane junctions induced\nby membrane-membrane adhesion with a continuum theory. In the hard membrane approximation where the membrane-membrane distance and junction densities are assumed\nto be constants, we find that \u25b32h \u039b+ and \u03bb are the important parameters which governs the\njunction separation. When \u03bb = 0, both types of junctions have the same rigidity, and the\njunction separation is driven by the height difference of the junctions. Under this condition\nthe junction separation is very similar to the Flory-Huggins theory for a binary mixture.\nPhase separation occurs when \u25b32h \u039b+ > 2 and \u03bc\u2212 = 0, the phase coexistence curve ends at\na critical point \u03bc\u2212 = 0, \u25b32h \u039b+ = 2. When \u03bb 6= 0, the junctions have different rigidities,\n\nand the softer junctions are easier to form than the stiffer junctions. Therefore the softer\njunctions have a tendency to aggregate. In this more general case, the height difference and\nthe junction rigidities difference both drive the phase separation, thus the phase separation\n15\n\n\fcan occur at \u25b32h \u039b+ < 2.\nThe Gaussian fluctuations around the hard membrane solution reveals a membranemediated nonlocal interaction between the junctions. This interaction is short-ranged, which\ndecays with a characteristic length (\u039b+ \u03c6+M + \u039b\u2212 \u03c6\u2212M )\u22121/4 , it is attractive between the same\ntype of junctions, but repulsive between different types of junctions. The strength of this interaction is proportional to \u25b32h , and it is due to the membrane bending energy cost between\nregions with different junction densities. Perturbation theory to one-loop order shows other\neffects of thermal fluctuations, this includes a renormalization of the chemical potential of\nthe junctions which effectively reduces the binding energies of the junctions, and a nonlocal\ninteraction between the junctions which is independent of \u25b3h . The fact that the contribution from one-loop calculation is non-vanishing even when junctions of type-1 and type-2\nhave the same height indicates that this contribution is a result of thermal fluctuations of\nthe membranes. Hence it is non-vanishing at all finite temperatures. When the contribution\nfrom one-loop calculation becomes very large, the hard membrane solution is qualitatively\nincorrect, and the effects of thermal fluctuations is a dominant factor. This can occur at\nvery low junction densities. The Gaussian fluctuations of the membrane-membrane distance\nalso provide another limit of the present analysis: the mean squared fluctuations of the\nmembrane-membrane distance should be small compare to hM . As a result, the analysis in\nthis article does not provide the complete physical picture of the system for very soft or very\nshort junctions, either.\nIn summary, mean field and fluctuation analysis of a simple coarse grained model for\nadhesion-induced phase separation of multiple species of membrane junctions is studied\nin this article. This model shows rich behaviors which capture much of the physics of\nmulti-species membrane junction separation induced by adhesion. I show that not only the\ndifference of junction height, but also the difference of junction rigidities, and the membranemediated interactions between the junctions play important roles in the junction separation.\nThe fluctuation analysis also shows that current analysis does not provide the complete physical picture for systems with very soft or very short junctions, or in the situation when the\njunction densities are extremely low, where the thermally activated membrane fluctuations\nor the Helfrich repulsion between the membranes become important interactions in the system [19]. In this regime, numerical simulations [7, 20] should provide valuable information\non the distribution of the junctions, as well as a complete picture of the phase diagram which\n16\n\n\fincludes the bind/unbinding transition between the membranes, and adhesion-induced junction separations.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nIt is a pleasure to thank David Lu and David Jasnow for very helpful discussions.

The membrane heights are z1 (r) and z2 (r) from the\nreference plane. There are two types of receptors in one membrane, two types of\nligands in another membrane. Two types of junctions can be formed from the ligands\nand receptors. They have different natural lengths h1 and h2 . In general, different\ntypes of junctions also have different rigidities. The softer junctions are easier to be\nstretched or compressed from their natural length.\ng(\u03c6)\n\n-0.5\n\n\u03c6\n\n-0.25\n\n\u03bc\u2212\n-0.404\n-0.4045\n\n-0.0404\n-0.405\n-0.0408\n\n\u2022 Fig.2 The shape of g(\u03c6) with different values of \u03bc\u2212 when \u03bb = 0.2, and \u25b32h \u039b+ = 1.998.\nSolid line: \u03bc = \u22120.404, dashed line: \u03bc = \u22120.4045, dash-dotted line: \u03bc = \u22120.405.\nPhase coexistence occurs at \u03bc \u2248 \u22120.4045 even though \u25b32h \u039b+ < 2.0.\n\n21\n\n\fg(\u03c6)\n0.003\n\u03bb\n\n0.001\n-0.4 -0.2\n-0.001\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u03c6\n\n0\n0.025\n\n-0.003\n\n0.05\n\n\u2022 Fig.3 g(\u03c6) in the phase coexistence for different values of \u03bb with \u25b32h \u039b+ = 2.04.

The thin dashed curve is the position of the end points of the\nphase coexistence curves, this is given by \u25b32h \u039b+ \u2248 2(1 \u2212 9\u03bb2 /4), \u03bc\u2212 \u2248 \u22122\u03bb.

This\ninteraction comes from the bilinear coupling between \u03b4l and \u03b4\u03c6\u03b1 . (A) A small region\nwhich has higher density in the junctions with greater natural height (or lower density\nin the junctions with smaller natural height) induces a positive \u03b4l. Two regions with\npositive \u03b4l can reduce the bending elastic energy of the membranes by moving close to\neach other. Similarly, a region with negative \u03b4l attracts another region with negative\n\u03b4l due to the cost of membrane bending energy. (B) A small region with positive \u03b4l\nrepels with a region with negative \u03b4l because of the bending elastic energy cost of the\nthe high curvature region between them.\nG(x)\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2.5\n\n5\n\n7.5\n\n10\n\nx\n\n\u2022 Fig.6 The shape of the MeijerG function G(x).
