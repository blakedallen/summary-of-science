We also address the question\nof if and how models with one or several dark fluids can be observationally distinguished. Simpler\nand physically clearer derivations of some key results, most notably on the relation between the\ngeneralized Chaplygin gas and the standard (\u039bCDM) 'concordance' model and on a Jeans-type\nsmall-scale instability of some coupled dark energy/dark matter models are presented.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nObservations have been steadily piling over the years\nthat can only be 'explained', in the context of General\nRelativity, by the presence of so-called dark forms of energy: ordinary baryonic matter and radiation are simply\nnot enough [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In broad terms, a dark energy\ncomponent (violating the strong energy condition) is required to explain the recent acceleration of the Universe\nand a (cold) dark matter component to account for the\namount of structure observed.\nUnfortunately, these components have never been observed directly. In fact, they may not exist at all. It\nis certainly possible to engineer dark energy and dark\nmatter out of the picture, by modifying General Relativity directly; often this process involves extra-dimensions\nwith non-trivial topologies and/or fiddling with TeVeS\ngravity sources [6] (see also [7, 8]). At the moment, however, most modifications seem far too ad hoc to be particularly pleasing. In this paper, we will mostly work\nwithin the confines of General Relativity, i.e., we will assume that dark energy and dark matter are real entities.\nOn the other hand, if this assumption is correct, it is\ntruly mind boggling to find out that roughly 96% of the\nUniverse should be in this dark form. Cosmology is thus\nhard-pressed to explain what these components are.\nCertainly the realization that dark energy and dark\nmatter may not be independent entities should play a\nsignificant role. Although we frequently perceive them\nas being different, this does not have to be the case. The\nChaplygin gas [9, 10], for instance, experienced a short\nburst of popularity precisely for being able to mimic both\ndark energy and dark matter (depending on the local density), and still be just one form of energy-an exotic one,\ngranted, but the same can be said of quintessence, k-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: ppavelin@fc.up.pt\naddress: luis.beca@fc.up.pt\n\u2021 Electronic address: C.J.A.P.Martins@damtp.cam.ac.uk\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nessence, and the rest of the phenomenological zoo. Thus,\nwe should be open to the possibility that dark energy and\ndark matter are actually just different manifestations of\nthe same underlying field, not different entities per se.\nOn the theoretical front, the idea of a unified description\nof dark energy and dark matter has incredible heuristic\npotential and should be properly investigated. In case\nof failure, we would at least come back justified in treating dark energy and dark matter as an independent pair.\nEither way, something of value could be gained.\nWhile the background and linear properties of unified\ndark energy models have been extensively studied by the\ncommunity, the non-linear aspects of the problem have\nbeen largely ignored. In the following section, we will\ndiscuss in detail the averaging problem in the context of\nthese models and show that non-linearities are a crucial\naspect that cannot be neglected.\n\nII.\n\nAVERAGING IN UNIFIED DARK ENERGY\nMODELS\n\nThe real Universe (henceforth denoted by manifold M)\ndisplays hierarchical structures like stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and so on; it is far from being smooth.\nThe dynamics in M is assumed to be entirely described\nby General Relativity (or some modified version of), as\ngravity is the relevant force at work on cosmological\nscales. In practice, however, due to the highly non-linear\nnature of the field equations, it is virtually impossible to\nsolve them fully (even numerically), except for a few high\nsymmetry configurations; see, for instance, [11].\nOn the other hand, several observations indicate that\nthe Universe looks increasingly smooth, as larger and\nlarger scales are considered (typically over 100 Mpc).\nThis average background (representing the global behaviour of M) is routinely idealized as a completely featureless manifold, hereafter denoted by manifold hMi.\nThe kinematics in hMi is essentially contained in the cosmological principle, but what about its dynamics? This\nis actually a tricky question. Normally, it is assumed\n\n\f2\nthat General Relativity applies just as well in hMi as it\ndoes in M. Yet, when we average M to obtain the background, we are also averaging complex non-linear interactions. Averaging linear terms in the field equations is\nno big deal, but averaging non-linear terms is: this is because they introduce backreaction terms and hence new\ndynamics.\nThe common expectation however, is that this backreaction is negligible. Proving this, of course, is very hard;\neven checking it numerically is extremely difficult. As\na matter of fact, 'averaging', in General Relativity, remains largely an unresolved problem [12, 13]. In connection to this, it has even been suggested that the current\nacceleration of the Universe might be the result of these\ncorrections, which would avoid the need for an exotic\ndark energy component (see for example [14] and references therein). As appealing as this may sound, however,\nsuch corrections are extremely hard to quantify, and currently there is no convincing argument to show that they\nare sufficiently large to do the job. The few times that\nsuch an analysis has been attempted, by studying high\nsymmetry configurations such as closely spaced sheets of\nmatter separated by voids (which are arguably not a good\napproximation of the real universe), have shown them to\nbe small, and hence incapable of producing an accelerated behaviour [15] (see also [16]).\nA related problem that will be relevant for what follows\nconcerns the averaging of the energy content of the universe described by the energy-momentum tensor of the\nmatter fields. The evolution of hMi is usually assumed\nto be described by General Relativity with a source term\ngiven by the energy-momentum tensor of a perfect fluid\nwith an energy density h\u03b5i, where h i is an appropriate\naverage, and a known equation of state, p = p(\u03b5). Even\nif we take for granted that for p = 0 backreaction effects are small, we can not ignore the fact that in general\nhpi 6= p(h\u03b5i). An exception to this is the special case\nwhere the equation of state is given by p = w\u03b5 where w\nis a constant; then, we have hpi = wh\u03b5i = p(h\u03b5i). However, this is no longer true for the equation of state of\nthe phenomenological model known as the generalized\nChaplygin gas [17],\nA\np=\u2212 \u03b1,\n\u03c1\nwhere A and \u03b1 are positive constants.\nstraightforward to check that\n\n(1)\nIndeed, it is\n\nhpi = \u2212hA/\u03b5\u03b1 i =\n6 \u2212A/h\u03b5i\u03b1 = p(h\u03b5i) .\n\n(2)\n\nThis is in fact a crucial problem in the analysis of all\nunified dark energy models not sufficiently close to a\n\u039bCDM model (which for the generalized Chaplygin gas\nis characterized by \u03b1 = 0 [18]) for the above effects to\nbe negligible-indeed, this invalidates quite a few simple analyses. In fact, it has been shown that in some\nmodels the transition from matter to dark energy domination may never occur or may do so much earlier than\n\nexpected in the absence of perturbations [19, 20]. Of\ncourse, this problem only occurs when perturbations become non-linear on certain scales. If, on the other hand,\nperturbations are linear on every scale then\nhpi = hp(h\u03b5i(1 + \u03b4))i \u223c hp(h\u03b5i)i ,\n\n(3)\n\nif \u03b4 = (\u03b5 \u2212 h\u03b5i)/h\u03b5i \u226a 1.\nIII.\n\nSCALAR FIELDS\n\nIn this paper we will use a (\u2212 + ++) metric signature.\nNow, let us consider the action\nZ\n\u221a\nS = d4 x \u2212g L(X, \u03c6) ,\n(4)\nwhere L is the Lagrangian density, \u03c6 is a real scalar field\nand\n1\nX = \u2212 \u2207\u03bc \u03c6\u2207\u03bc \u03c6 ,\n2\n\n(5)\n\nis the kinetic term. As a simple example, consider the\ncase of a classical scalar field \u03c6 governed by the so-called\ncanonical Lagrangian\nL = X \u2212 V (\u03c6) ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere V (\u03c6) is some scalar potential. The energymomentum tensor may be obtained by varying the action\nrelative to the inverse metric, which yields\nT\u03bc\u03bd (\u03c6) = \u2207\u03bc \u03c6\u2207\u03bd \u03c6 + (X \u2212 V (\u03c6))g\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(7)\n\nIf we now make the following identifications\n\u2207\u03bc \u03c6\n,\nu\u03bc = \u221a\n2X\n\n\u03b5 = X + V (\u03c6) ,\n\np = X \u2212 V (\u03c6) ,\n\n(8)\n\nand plug them into (7) we obtain\nT \u03bc\u03bd = (\u03b5 + p)u\u03bc u\u03bd + pg \u03bc\u03bd ;\n\n(9)\n\nhence the energy-momentum tensor of \u03c6 can be written\nin the form of a perfect fluid. Recall that in (9), u\u03bc is the\n4-velocity field describing the motion of the fluid (if \u2207\u03bc \u03c6\nis timelike) while \u03b5 and p, are its proper energy density\nand pressure, respectively.\nThe above is easily generalized for an arbitrary Lagrangian density of the form L(X, \u03c6) [21]. This defines\na new class of scalars broad enough for our purposes.\nAgain, we can still explicitly rewrite the energy momentum tensor for this model in a perfect fluid form, by\nmeans of the following identifications\n\u2207\u03bc \u03c6\n,\nu\u03bc = \u221a\n2X\n\n\u03b5 = 2Xp,X \u2212 p ,\n\np = L(X, \u03c6) . (10)\n\nFrom this it follows that if p = p(X), then \u03b5 = \u03b5(X).\nUnfortunately, it is not always possible to invert \u03b5(X),\n\n\f3\nand obtain X(\u03b5) but when it is, the fluid has an explicit\nisentropic equation of state p = p(\u03b5). A useful example is\np \u221d X n which, as one can easily check, describes a constant \u03c9 = 1/(2n \u2212 1) fluid. In particular, when n = 0 the\nscalar corresponds to a standard cosmological constant,\nn = 1, to a massless scalar field, n = 2, to background radiation, and so on. In the limit of large n, the scalar field\ncan be interpreted as dust (a pressureless non-relativistic\nfluid).\nHow about the generalized Chaplygin gas? We can\nretro-engineer (10) to ascertain the necessary Lagrangian\nby solving\n\u03b5 = 2X\u03b1\n\nA\nA \u03b5,X\n+ \u03b1,\n\u03b1\n\u03b5 \u03b5\n\u03b5\n\n(11)\n\na non-linear differential equation. Dividing by \u03b5 and\nrewriting everything in terms of a new function \u03be =\nA/\u03b51+\u03b1 , we end up with a much nicer linear version\n1=\u2212\n\n\u03b1\n2X\u03be,X + \u03be ,\n1+\u03b1\n\n(12)\n\nwhich is easy to solve. The solution is\n\u03be = 1 \u2212 (2X)\n\n1+\u03b1\n2\u03b1\n\n1\n\u03b1\nA\n= \u2212A 1+\u03b1 \u03be 1+\u03b1 ,\n\u03b1\n\u03b5\n\n(14)\n\nwith 0 < 2X < 1.\nFinally, the sound speed for any scalar field (canonic or\notherwise) is also well defined and determined in linear\ntheory to be [21]\nc2s \u2261\n\nL,X\np,X\n=\n;\n\u03b5,X\nL,X + 2XL,XX\n\n(15)\n\ncontrast this to the isentropic result \u03b4p/\u03b4\u03b5. It follows that\nquintessence has a constant sound speed of unity. This\nis another reason why quintessence cannot reproduce the\ngeneralized Chaplygin gas. On the other hand, if we\napply this formula to the scalar field governed by (14),\nthe sound speed does come out the same as the isentropic\none and all is well.\nIV.\n\nThus, everywhere in M, the Lagrangian decomposes\nnicely into a cosmological constant plus 'matter', thus\ndemonstrating the equivalence between \u03b1 = 0 and\n\u039bCDM to any order; gravity alone does not distinguish\nbetween the two. Moreover, given that both are, to a\ncertain extent, simply toy-models with somewhat shaky\nmotivations from fundamental physics, this is probably\nas far as they can be meaningfully compared.\n\n(13)\n\nand thus the Lagrangian which reproduces the generalized Chaplygin becomes\nL(X) = p(X) = \u2212\n\napparent after [22] appeared. In it the surprising claim\nwas made that the linear evolution of perturbations for\n\u039bCDM and the \u03b1 = 0 generalized Chaplygin gas model\nactually differed. Nevertheless, in [18] it was shown that\nthis was not true (see also [23]; their equivalence to first\norder in the metric perturbations was established and it\nwas equally argued that the correspondence went well\nbeyond linear order. Here we give a much simpler proof\nof this equivalence. If we expand (14) in a power series\nand take the limiting case \u03b1 \u2192 0 we obtain\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1+\u03b1\n\u03b1\n1/1+\u03b1\n2\u03b1\n,\n(2X)\n1\u2212\np(X) = lim \u2212A\n\u03b1\u21920\n1+\u03b1\n= \u2212A + 0 * (2X)\u221e = \u2212A .\n(16)\n\nINTERLUDE: THE \u039bCDM LIMIT\n\nImplementing the generalized Chaplygin gas as a scalar\nfield obeying a particular Lagrangian is useful on a number of levels. For one, it allows us to prove that the\n\u03b1 = 0 limit of the generalized Chaplygin gas is totally\nequivalent to an ordinary \u039bCDM model. This fact plays\nan important role when comparing unified dark energy\nmodels with observations. While obviously true in the\nabsence of perturbations, the need to explicitly demonstrate this beyond a zero-order equivalence, only became\n\nV.\n\nA TRULY 'ATOMIC' FLUID?\n\nWe have shown that the \u03b1 = 0 limit of the generalized Chaplygin gas is equivalent to \u039bCDM. An obvious\nfollow-up question is whether this equivalence between a\nsingle unified dark energy fluid and some family of minimally coupled components is valid in general. Recently\n[24] has argued that it is always possible to split a single\nunified dark energy fluid into different minimally coupled\ncomponents or to combine several fluids into a single fluid\nbehaving in exactly the same way as the original mixture,\nfrom a cosmological point of view. Although this is obvious in the absence of perturbations, it was also argued\nthat this degeneracy went beyond the background level.\nBefore trying to answer the above question, we need to\nclearly define what we mean by a single fluid. It is clear\nthat by allowing the complexity of the fluid to be arbitrarily large, for example by considering very high order\ntensor fields, we may in principle get disproportionately\nnon-trivial dynamics. However, in this case, do we have\none fluid or several minimally coupled fluids? In general, a complex single fluid description is also prone to\na multi-fluid interpretation. In this paper, we shall refer\nto a single indivisible ('atomic') fluid as one whose Lagrangian density is a function of a real scalar field which\nhas the form L(X, \u03c6). We shall focus our attention on\nthe isentropic subfamily characterized by an equation of\nstate of the form p = p(\u03b5).\nIt goes without saying that the energy-momentum tensor of any fluid can always be split into several pieces. In\nfact there is an infinite number of ways to accomplish\nthis. The critical question, however, is how to interpret\nany such decomposition. Are the resulting parts real\n\n\f4\nphysical fluids? Do they exist independently from one\nother? We have already seen that the answer is no if the\ngeneralized Chaplygin gas does originate from the single\nscalar field governed by (14). Each piece is then a virtual\ncomponent, i.e., without independent existence (except\nin the special \u03b1 = 0 case). In fact, the evolution of individual virtual parts is not, in general, constrained by\ncausality. Conversely, if we are in the presence of various\nfluids we can also add their energy-momentum tensors.\nHowever, the dynamics of the resulting fluid could be\nvery complex and in general it will not be describable by\na real scalar field with a Lagrangian density of the form\nL(X, \u03c6).\nFrom a cosmological point of view all the relevant information is contained in the energy momentum tensor\nwhich acts as a source for the gravitational field. Pending laboratory evidence (which in principle can detect not\nonly fields themselves but even couplings between them)\nwe are only sensitive to the total energy-momentum tensor and consequently [24] argues that cosmology alone\ndoes not provide useful information on whether a single\nunified dark energy fluid or a family of minimally coupled\nfluids is responsible for the observations.\nHowever, if we have a single fluid described by an arbitrary equation of state p = p(\u03b5) and consider the evolution of very large wavelength perturbations in a homogeneous and isotropic universe we know that, given local\ninitial conditions for H and \u03b5, the subsequent evolution\nis the same in any such patch. This is no longer true if\nwe consider a family of minimally coupled fluids. Let us\nconsider large wavelength flat patches characterized by\nthe same value of H (flatness implies that the value of \u03b5\nis also the same in any such patches). It is then easy to\nshow that we may find any number of families of three\nminimally coupled fluids with the same initial conditions\nfor \u03b5, \u03b5\u0307, p, and \u1e57 but with very different subsequent evolutions. As an example consider the two families of three\nfluids characterized by a constant w with\n\u2022 w1 = \u22121 = \u2212w3 and w2 = 0, with \u03b5i /\u03b5 = 1/3 for\ni = 1, 2, 3\n\u221a\n\u2022 w1 = \u2212 6/3 = \u2212w3 , with \u03b5j /\u03b5 = 1/2 for j = 1, 3\nand \u03b52 /\u03b5 = 0\nWe see that if we are in the presence of various fluids, a\nsimilar behaviour at a given time may well lead to very\ndifferent behaviours at a later time. Moreover, we are\neven allowed to decide how much freedom we wish to\ngive ourselves: we may set up adiabatic or iso-curvature\nfluctuations (or indeed a combination of them). Clearly,\nthe former situation will be more restrictive than the latter.\nVI.\n\nLINEAR INSTABILITIES IN UNIFIED\nDARK ENERGY MODELS\n\nThe simplest unified dark energy model (the generalized Chaplygin gas in the \u03b1 = 0 limit) has a vanishing\n\nsound speed c2s = 0 but this is no longer the case in the\ncontext of more general models. It is easy to show [25]\nthat the evolution of the sound speed in the absence of\nnon-linear perturbations is fully determined by the background evolution and is equal to\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\u0015\ndp\n1\n1 d\nc2s \u2261\nH2 q \u2212\n,\n(17)\n=\nd\u03c1\n3H dH\n2\nwhere q \u2261 \u2212\u00e4/(aH2 ) is the usual deceleration parameter.\nThe sign of c2s is thus linked to the background dynamics\nand in particular to how fast the transition from dark\nmatter to dark energy occurs.\nA simple illustration of the above point is provided by\nthe generalized Chaplygin gas equation of state given by\nEqn. (1), which corresponds to\nw = \u2212A/\u03b5 1+\u03b1 ;\n\n(18)\n\nphenomenologically we allow \u03b1 to take any value. For\n\u03b1 > 0 this is the generalized Chaplygin gas itself, for\n\u03b1 = 0 this is equivalent to \u039bCDM and for \u03b1 = \u22121 and\nA \u2264 1 it is equivalent (in the absence of perturbations\nonly) to a standard quintessence model with constant w.\nWe shall not consider the case with \u03b1 < \u22121 since this\nwould imply a universe which is dark energy dominated\nat early times and we are only interested in the late time\nbehaviour of dark energy. This fluid illustrates the above\npoints. For \u03b1 > \u22121 its energy density evolves as\n\u0014\n\n\u03b5 = \u03b50 A + (1 \u2212 A)\n\n\u0010 a \u00113(1+\u03b1) \u00151/1+\u03b1\n0\n\na\n\n,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere A = A/\u03b51+\u03b1\nis a constant. The sound speed has\n0\nthe form c2s = \u2212\u03b1w and consequently c2s > 0 for \u03b1 > 0.\nWe clearly see that the sign is related to the speed of the\ntransition from the matter dominated era to the dark\nenergy dominated era. If it is steep enough (specifically,\nfaster than in \u039bCDM), c2s will be positive, otherwise it\nwill be negative.\nOn the other hand, consider a universe with matter\nand a standard scalar field with the Lagrangian of Eqn.\n(6) and consider what happens if we treat cold dark matter (CDM) and dark energy (DE) as a single isentropic\nfluid. This may be justifiable, to a certain extent, if there\nis a strong coupling between the dark matter and dark\nenergy sectors as is the case in [26, 27, 28]. In the absence\nof perturbations, the energy density of this effective fluid\nsatisfies\n\u03b5\u0307\n= \u22123H(1 + \u03c9) ,\n\u03b5\n\n(20)\n\nwith w = pDE /(\u03b5DE + \u03b5CDM ) > \u22121. Since \u03b5 > 0 we\nobviously have \u03b5\u0307 < 0, and the sign of c2s only depends on\nthe pressure evolution which is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\ndp\ndV\ndV\n\u223c \u2212\u03c6\u0307\n= \u03c6\u0307 \u03c6\u0308 \u2212\n= \u2212V\u0307 > 0 ,\n(21)\ndt\nd\u03c6\nd\u03c6\n\n\f5\nwhere the slow-roll approximation has been used. Hence,\nin this case\nc2s =\n\n\u1e57\n< 0.\n\u03b5\u0307\n\n(22)\n\nThis instability [25] will occur in any case where \u1e57 > 0\n(assuming \u03b5\u0307 < 0). A particular example of this is the\nJeans-type instability studied in [26, 27, 28, 29, 30],\nwhich occurs for models where there is a sufficiently\nstrong coupling between dark matter and dark energy.\n(Note, however, that such large couplings are strongly\nconstrained by several equivalence principle type experiments, so the cosmological relevance of these models remains unclear.) If wDE is a constant, it is straightforward\nto show that\nc2s =\n\nwDE (1 + wDE )\u03b5DE\n.\n(1 + wDE )\u03b5DE + \u03b5CDM\n\n(23)\n\nInterestingly, the models where this instability is absent\nare precisely those where one can get wDE < \u22121 (as long\nas wDE > \u22121 \u2212 \u03b5CDM /\u03b5DE ) [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. Hence,\nthe above argument for c2s < 0 no longer holds if one\nallows wDE < \u22121.\n\nof two dark fluids for which so far there is no direct experimental evidence. It is therefore natural to consider\nscenarios where these fluids are coupled, or even different\nmanifestations of a single fluid.\nIn this paper, we have re-visited unified dark energy\nmodels and discussed some of their distinguishing features. In particular, we have addressed in some detail\nthe averaging problem, showing that non-linear effects\ncannot, in general, be ignored. We have also clarified the\nrelation between a particular class of UDE models and\nthe standard \u039bCDM paradigm, and the physical reason\nbehind a Jeans-type instability that has been identified\nin sufficiently coupled models.\nWe have equally discussed the question of whether\nmodels with one or several dark fluids can be observationally distinguished showing that in the latter case, similar\ninitial conditions for the total energy density and pressure can lead to very different outcomes. This degeneracy\nis absent in single fluid models.\n\nIn the so-called concordance cosmology model, a range\nof observational data is used to postulate the existence\n\nFinally, we would like to point out that a laboratory\ndetection of one or more dark components is not the only\nway of ultimately breaking this degeneracy. Equivalence\nprinciple tests, for example, can provide key information\non the dark sector. Even more promising is the prospect\nof using astrophysical measurements of varying couplings\nto reconstruct both the dark energy equation of state and\na measure of the dark sector's coupling to the standard\nmodel as a function of redshift [31]. This will be further\nexplored in future work.\n\n[1] A. G. Riess et al. (Supernova Search Team), Astron. J.\n116, 1009 (1998), astro-ph/9805201.\n[2] S. Perlmutter et al.
