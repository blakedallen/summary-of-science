The imaginary part\nof the zeros are interpreted as mean-field single-particle energies, and one\nfills them up to a Fermi energy EF . The distribution of the total energy is\nshown to be non-Gaussian, asymmetric, and independent of EF in the limit\nEF \u2192 \u221e. The moments of the limit distribution are computed analytically.\nThe autocorrelation function, the finite energy corrections, and a comparison\nwith random matrix theory are also discussed.\n\nTypeset using REVTEX\n1\n\n\fP\n\nAccording to the Riemann hypothesis, the complex zeros of the function \u03b6(s) = n\u2212s\n(defined for Re s > 1, and by analytic continuation to the rest of the complex plane) are\nlocated on the critical line s\u03bc = 1/2 + i E\u03bc , with E\u03bc real. There is a natural connexion\nbetween this hypothesis and quantum mechanics that originates on a spectral interpretation\nof the complex zeros s\u03bc . Indeed, a general strategy to prove the hypothesis was suggested\nby Hilbert and P\u00f3lya, who proposed to find an hermitian operator whose eigenvalues are\nprecisely the E\u03bc 's. This operator may be viewed as the quantization of an hypothetical classical dynamical system, which determines the \"Riemann dynamics\". Although the classical\nHamiltonian corresponding to the Riemann dynamics is not known, there are evidences for\nits existence. When the E\u03bc are interpreted as quantum eigenvalues, both their statistical\nproperties [1\u20133] as well as a semiclassical interpretation of their density [4] indicate that the\nRiemann dynamics is fully chaotic and has no time-reversal symmetry. The semiclassical\ninterpretation provides in fact much more detailed information (cf Eq.(2)), in particular\nconcerning the classical periodic orbits. This leads to a somewhat paradoxical situation:\nalthough the \"Riemann Hamiltonian\" is not known, the detailed properties of its dynamics\nare. From the perspective of a dynamicist, the Riemann zeta thus offers the rare opportunity\nof a chaotic motion for which the relevant dynamical information is simple and explicitly\nknown. Not to mention the impressive amount of existing numerical data on the complex\nzeros [2], as well as the number-theoretic background of \u03b6(s), also useful in the present\ncontext.\nMany aspects of the Riemann dynamics have been investigated (see [5,6] for recent review\narticles). Here we explore new facets of the problem related to a different use of the complex\nzeros as suggested by physical analogies. We consider the location E\u03bc > 0 of the complex\nzeros of \u03b6(s) as the single-particle levels of a fermionic many-body system. In the mean\nfield approximation, the ground-state total energy is obtained by filling the single-particle\nlevels from the lowest Riemann zero up to a \"Fermi energy\" EF . We are interested in\nthe properties of such a Fermi gas. Following nuclear physics terminology, we refer to this\n\"element\" as the Riemannium.\nAt zero temperature, the properties of the Riemannium are described by the grand\npotential\n\u03a9(EF ) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nEF\n\n(E \u2212 EF )\u03c1(E)dE = \u2212\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nEF\n\nN (E)dE .\n\n(1)\n\nP\n\nHere \u03c1(E) = \u03bc \u03b4(E \u2212 E\u03bc ) is the spectral\ndensity of the complex Riemann zeros interpreted\nR\nas quantum eigenvalues and N (E) = \u03c1(E)dE its counting function. \u03a9(E) corresponds to\nthe sum of the imaginary part of the Riemann zeros satisfying 0 < E\u03bc \u2264 EF , using EF as\nreference energy [7]. It is therefore the total energy of the system. To calculate the grand\npotential we make use of the decomposition of the spectral density in smooth plus oscillatory\ne The former, as a Weyl series, has an explicit asymptotic expansion for\nparts, \u03c1 = \u03c1 + \u03c1.\nlarge E. The oscillating term is an interference sum over the prime numbers p = 2, 3, . . .

An unusual fact of the Riemann dynamics that plays\nan important role in what follows is the independence with respect to the energy E of the\nperiods and Lyapounov exponents (notice also the minus sign in front of Eq.(2)).\nThe spectral density can be integrated twice to obtain the smooth and oscillatory contributions to the grand potential, \u03a9(EF ) = \u2212EF2 log(EF /2\u03c0)/4\u03c0 + 3EF2 /8\u03c0 \u2212 7EF /8 \u2212\nlog EF /48\u03c0 + cte, and\n\u221e\n1 XX\nexp(i EF r log p)\ne\n\u03a9(E\n)\n=\n\u2212\nRe\n.\nF\n\u03c0\nr 2 pr/2 log p\np r=1\n\n(3)\n\ne as a function of the Fermi energy E .\nWe are interested in the statistical properties of \u03a9\nF\ne\nFrom Eq.(3) we have h\u03a9i = 0. The average is done over an energy window which is small\ne (the typical scale of oscillation will be\ncompared to EF but contains several oscillations of \u03a9\ngiven below).\nAs we will now see, the Riemannium has very peculiar properties. The most important\ne denoted P (\u03a9),\ne\nones demonstrated here are: i) the distribution of \u03a9,\nis independent of\ne\nenergy as EF \u2192 \u221e; ii) P (\u03a9) is non-Gaussian and asymmetric; iii) all the moments of\ne may be computed with very good accuracy from Eq.(3), their value being dominated\nP (\u03a9)\nby the contribution of the lowest prime numbers; iv) the asymmetry of the distribution is\ndue to an interference effect between repetitions of periodic orbits; v) the autocorrelation\ne\ne\nh\u03a9(E\nF )\u03a9(EF + \u01eb)i is a non-decaying irregular oscillatory function; vi) the finite energy\ne are universal and well described by a circular unitary ensemble of random\ncorrections to P (\u03a9)\nmatrices (CUE).\ne were explored in the past. Selberg [10] computed\nSome of the statistical properties of \u03a9\nthe even moments of the distribution. Up to an additive constant and a global change of\ne\nsign, \u03a9(E)\ncoincides with the function denoted S1 (t) by him. More recently, Odlyzko [2]\nhas numerically calculated the first four moments, but no comparison has been made with\nthe analytical results of Selberg.\ne whose properties are now discussed. We\nOn Fig. 1 is displayed the distribution P (\u03a9)\nbegin by computing the second moment.

Rigorous arguments valid for times Tmin \u226a T \u226a TH , where Tmin = log 2\nis the shortest period of the system and TH = 2\u03c0 \u03c1\u0304 = log(EF /2\u03c0) is the Heisenberg time\nat EF , and heuristic for longer ones, show [1] that the form factor of the complex zeros of\n\u03b6(s) tends, as EF goes to infinity, to the corresponding function KGU E of Gaussian random\nmatrices with unitary symmetry (GUE). The latter behaves as KGU E (T ) = T for T < TH ,\nand KGU E (T ) = TH for T > TH . However, the replacement K = KGU E in Eq.(4) and\n3\n\n\fe because the\nits extrapolation to short times is of no use to understand the behavior of \u03a9,\nintegral diverges. In other words, the second moment is dominated by the (non-universal)\nshort periodic orbits whose contribution has to be considered explicitly. We therefore keep\nas leading-order approximation the diagonal part (i = j) in the double sum (4). This gives\nthe convergent sum\ne 2i =\nh\u03a9\n0\n\n\u221e\n1\n1 XX\n\u2248 7.9 \u00d7 10\u22122 .\n2\n4\nr\n2\u03c0 p r=1 r p log2 p\n\n(5)\n\ne\nThis equation exhibits two of the main properties of P (\u03a9).\nThe first one is its asymptotic\nindependence with respect to energy. This fact is not generic for dynamical systems, since\ne 2 i grows linearly with the Fermi energy\nfor example for a Fermi gas in a chaotic cavity h\u03a9\n[11]. It is due to the independence of the periods and Lyapounov exponents with respect to\nenergy in the Riemann dynamics. The second property is its non-universality (the sum (5)\ndepends on the particular properties of the short orbits). The longer, statistically universal,\nperiodic orbits provide next-to-leading order corrections to Eq.(5). For times T \u226b Tmin the\nform factor KGU E can be used in Eq.(4), leading to the correction (independent of the prime\nnumbers)\ne 2 i = h\u03a9\ne 2i \u2212\nh\u03a9\n0\n\n1\n12\u03c0 2 log2 (EF /2\u03c0)\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nWe have numerically checked the validity of Eq.(6) down to values of EF of the order of a\nfew thousands.\nThe third basic feature of the distribution is its asymmetry, as revealed by the third\ne 3 i, whose computation is now sketched. The third power of \u03a9\ne computed from\nmoment h\u03a9\nEq.(3) involves products of three cosines containing as argument the action of three different\nprime numbers. This product may be expressed as a sum of cosines involving the sum and\ndifferences of the actions. The term involving the sum of actions has zero average. As before,\nthe remaining sum is dominated by the smallest primes. Due to the non-commensurability of\nthe periods of the different primes we restrict moreover to the approximation pi = pj = pk =\np. The oscillating factors in the sum now have the typical form cos[E(ri + rj \u2212rk ) log p]. The\nonly terms of this type having a non-zero average are those satisfying rk = ri +rj . Since there\nare three different possibilities for choosing the backward repetition rk , we finally obtain the\nconvergent sum\ne 3 i= \u2212\nh\u03a9\n0\n\n\u221e\n3 X X\n[r 2 r 2 (ri + rj )2 pri +rj log3 p]\u22121\n4\u03c0 3 p ri ,rj =1 i j\n\n\u2248 \u22125.78 \u00d7 10\u22123 .\n\n(7)\n\ne is therefore related to a simple but non-trivial interference pheThe asymmetry of P (\u03a9)\nnomenon occurring between two (different or not) repetitions of a given orbit compensated\nby a backward one. The extreme case where only p = 2 and its repetitions are taken into\naccount in Eq.(7) yields already 90% of its value.\nThe higher moments of the distribution are computed likewise. In the limit EF \u2192 \u221e\nto leading order they are given by expressions similar to, though more complicated than,\n\n4\n\n\fEq.(7). Table I shows a comparison of the analytical results with numerical data up to\nthe sixth moment. The agreement between both calculations is astonishing. Our numerical\nresults also coincide for the lowest moments with those obtained in [2].\nAn additional characterization of the Riemannium comes from the autocorrelation of the\ne\ne\ne2\ntotal energy C\u03a9 (\u01eb) = h\u03a9(E\nF ) \u03a9(EF + \u01eb)i/h\u03a90 i. We evaluate this quantity to leading order\nby using the expansion (3) and making a diagonal approximation. This leads to\nC\u03a9 (\u01eb) =\n\n\u221e\nXX\n1\ncos(\u01eb r log p)\n.\n2\n4 r\ne 2i\n2\u03c0 2 h\u03a9\np r=1 r p log p\n0\n\n(8)\n\nDue to the dominance of the shortest orbits in the sum (8) C\u03a9 is an irregularly fluctuating\nnon-decaying function, as illustrated on Fig. 2. The fundamental period 2\u03c0/ log 2 \u2248 9.06\nassociated to the shortest orbit can be clearly observed.\nIt is interesting to make a comparison of the previous results with random matrix theory. As already emphasized, the GUE is not really appropriate because no short-time scale\nequivalent to Tmin is built-in in the theory (and this produces a divergence of the moments).\nWe therefore concentrate on the CUE which, contrary to the Gaussian one, has an inherent\nshort-time scale (although more appropriate measures, not relevant for the present discussion, have been recently proposed [12]). The following analysis reveals also some striking\nsimilarities existing between the Riemann zeros and eigenvalues of circular ensembles. Consider an N \u00d7 N unitary matrix U describing the time-periodic dynamical evolution of a\nquantum system. We fix for simplicity the periodicity to one. The Floquet spectrum of\nU is given by the eigenvalue equation U\u03c8\u03b1 = exp(i\u03b8\u03b1 )\u03c8\u03b1 , \u03b1 = 1, . . . , N. \u03c8\u03b1 are the (stroboscopic) eigenstates and \u03b8\u03b1 the eigenphases. The spectral density on the unit circle is\nP\n\u03c1CU E (\u03b8) = \u03b1 \u03b4(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u03b1 ). The 2\u03c0\u2013periodicity of this function leads to a decomposition in\nsmooth plus oscillatory parts, \u03c1CU E = N/2\u03c0 + \u03c1eCU E , with\n\u221e\nX\n1\n\u03c1eCU E (\u03b8) = Re\nTrU k exp(\u2212ik\u03b8) .\n\u03c0 k=1\n\n(9)\n\nAs was done for Eq.(2), a direct comparison of Eq.(9) with Gutzwiller trace formula allows\nto make a \"na\u0131\u0308ve\" semiclassical interpretation of this equation. We look at it as a sum\nover the periodic orbits of a classical map labelled by the index k = 1, 2, . . ., having period\nTk = k, action Sk = k \u03b8, (local) energy \u03b8, stability amplitude Ak = TrU k , and h\u0304 = 1\n(repetitions are degenerated with the fundamental periods). The interpretation of \u03b8 as the\nenergy satisfies, as it should, the classical relation Tk = \u2202Sk /\u2202\u03b8. We recover in this analogy\none of the basic properties of the Riemann dynamics: the independence of the periods with\nrespect to energy. Short orbits correspond to Tk \u2248 Tmin = 1, while long ones contributing\nto the density at the scale of the mean level spacing have period Tk \u2248 TH = 2\u03c0 \u03c1\u0304 = N.\nIf now an ensemble of unitary matrices is considered, Eq.(9) acquires a statistical meaning\nsince the prefactors TrU k have now a distribution. It is well known through, e.g., the prime\nnumber theorem and the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture, that asymptotically the statistical\nproperties of large prime numbers are those required to mimic random matrix statistics [1,6].\nSo for long times Eqs.(2) and (9) are very similar from a statistical point of view. This is\nnot the case for times T \u2248 Tmin . To have a quantitative description we look at the CUE\ndistribution of the grand potential, obtained by integrating \u03c1eCU E twice with respect to \u03b8,\n5\n\n\fe\n\u03a9\nCU E = (1/\u03c0)Re\n\nX\n\n(TrU k /k 2 )exp(\u2212ik\u03b8) .\n\n(10)\n\nk\n\nThe second moment is\n2\ne2\nh\u03a9\nCU E i=(1/2\u03c0 )\n\nX\n\nh|TrU k |2 i/k 4 .\n\n(11)\n\nk\n\nThe average is done over the ensemble of matrices. This expression is the CUE analog of\nEq.(4) (KCU E = h|TrU k |2 i). Using that h|TrU k |2 i = k if k \u2264 N and h|TrU k |2 i = N if k > N\n[13], we get\ne2\nh\u03a9\nCU E i =\n\n\u03b6(3)\n1\n\u2212\n+ O(1/N 4 ) ,\n2\u03c0 2\n12\u03c0 2 N 2\n\n(12)\n\nto be compared to Eq.(6). As for the Riemannium, the leading term \u03b6(3)/2\u03c0 2 \u2248 6.1 \u00d7\n10\u22122 is controlled by short times (small values of k) in the sum (11). Because the shorttime structure differ in both cases, the constants do not coincide. But the independence\nof the leading terms with respect to N (or energy) is not a coincidence and comes from\nthe structural similarities between Eqs.(2) and (9). Moreover, the next-to-leading order\ncorrections are the same if one identifies [14] the corresponding Heisenberg times N =\nlog(EF /2\u03c0). Both corrections come from times of order TH , where the statistical properties\nagree. This situation is in contrast with the results obtained, for instance, for the distribution\nof log \u03b6(1/2 + iE), which has been shown to agree to leading order with the (finite N) CUE\ndistribution, followed by non-universal corrections [14].\ne 2 i and h\u03a9\ne2\nThe qualitative agreement between h\u03a9\nCU E i is lost when considering odd powers\ne\nof \u03a9CU E . The latter can be shown to vanish in the limit N \u2192 \u221e. More generally, and\ne\ncontrary to the Riemann case, in that limit the distribution of \u03a9\nCU E tends to a Gaussian.\ne\nThis can be seen from Eq.(10). On the one hand we have demonstrated that \u03a9\nCU E is\nk\nasymptotically dominated by the lowest contributions in the sum. But TrU is known to\ne has also a\nbe, for k finite and N \u2192 \u221e, Gaussian independent distributed [13]. Therefore \u03a9\nlimiting normal distribution.\nThe techniques employed here to analyze the distribution of the grand potential are not\nspecific to the Riemann dynamics and can be applied in a wider context to the theory of\nFermi gases. Our results indicate that in general the grand potential of a Fermi gas, as\nwell as other physical quantities derived from it, are controlled by the shortest non-universal\nclassical orbits. This dominance leads, via the interference mechanisms illustrated here for\nthe grand potential of the Riemannium, to non-Gaussian asymmetric distributions for the\nassociated quantity. Some related results illustrating this general phenomenon were obtained\nby Tsang [15], who demonstrated non-Gaussian asymmetric distributions for the error term\nin the mean square formula of |\u03b6(1/2 + i E)|, and for the fluctuations of the number of\nlattice points inside a curve, namely a circle (see also [16]) and an hyperbola (known as the\ncircle problem and Dirichlet's divisor problem, respectively). The last two problems have\na dynamical interpretation in terms of the fluctuations of the spectral counting function of\nan associated integrable system. The mechanism leading to the asymmetry in [15] is very\nsimilar to the one found here. In contrast, the fluctuations of the counting function in the\nRiemann case are known to be asymptotically Gaussian [10] and are not dominated by the\nshort orbits. This difference in the behavior of the counting function can be traced back to\n6\n\n\fthe different short-time behavior of the form factor for integrable and chaotic systems, that\nproduces a dominance of the short orbits in the former. We find however that integrals of the\ncounting function (the grand potential being the first one, cf Eq.(1)) are always dominated\nby the short orbits, irrespective of the (chaotic or integrable) nature of the underlying\nclassical dynamics. On the mathematical side, the present results can be extended in a\nstraightforward manner to general Dirichlet's L-functions.\nIn summary we have considered, guided by physical analogies, new properties of the Riemann zeros that reveal new aspects of their dynamical interpretation as quantum eigenvalues\nof a classically chaotic system. Our results are relevant in the theory of Fermi systems, as\nwell as in the general context of quantum chaotic motion. Concerning the Riemann hypothesis and the search of the Hilbert\u2013P\u00f3lya Hamiltonian, the present study suggests that\ntime\u2013periodic dynamical evolutions have to be considered as serious candidates.\nWe are specially grateful to D.
