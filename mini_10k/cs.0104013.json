The equilibrium theory distinguishes\nbetween the standstill movement of each player putting the whole energy into tugging and\nthe displacement movement of all of the participating players in one direction in the end.\nHowever, the distinction does not tell anything significant to the participating players\nbecause each player is just tugging the rope with the fullest strength. Even if a spectator\nsays that the tug of war consists of two different kinds of movement, this observation\nwould remain most irrelevant to the participating players. To be sure, the equilibrium\n1\n\n\ftheory is excellent in precipitating a standstill equilibrium among the competing agencies.\nIt must be a greatest achievement in economic theorization. Nonetheless, there is also the\nother side of the achievement. The real economy to be addressed is not so elegant and\nsimplistic as the equilibrium theory would imply. What has to be focused at this point is to\nsee how the movement that may seem to displace the equilibrium point could come to be\nactually realized.\nThe economic dynamics going beyond the stipulation of the equilibrium theory can be\nseen more concretely in the national monetary economy (Matsuno, 1978a). Any nation\nstate has the sovereignty of letting its central bank have the monopoly of issuing the bank\nnotes. In the nation state monetary economy, every economic agent except for the central\nbank is required to observe the continuity of monetary flow between those coming into and\ngoing out. The condition of monetary flow continuity has to be observed in the record\ncompiling the completed transactions, otherwise either unlawful counterfeit or destroying\nof the bank notes must have been committed. At the least, the monetary authority keeps\nwatching and recording the continuity of monetary flow registered in the present perfect\ntense. The financial statistics issued regularly by the monetary authority is a sort of the\nbalance sheet on the state scale. One can find in the balance sheet a whole array of the\naccounting identities supplemented and specified by each concrete figure including the\noutstanding of the bank notes issued by the central bank. On the other hand, the monetary\neconomy is a system in movement, which is descriptively in the present progressive tense.\nThere thus arises a distinct contrast between the record in the present perfect and the\nmovement in the present progressive tense. This remark now lets us face a serious\nendeavor of figuring out how one could salvage the movement in progress from the vast\nrecord registered in the present perfect tense.\nIn particular, theoretical endeavor of elucidating movement in progress requires a\nstressful attention. If a movement in progress is adequately described in the present tense, it\nwould remain legitimate at any present moment and then turn out to be equivalent to\nsomething remaining in stasis. The movement that the equilibrium theory brings about is\njust this sort of movement equivalent to being in stasis. If it is intended to uphold the\nmovement in the present progressive tense upon the observation made in the present tense,\nboth movement and stasis would have to be one and the same. Precisely for this reason, any\nmovement going beyond the stipulation set by the equilibrium theory has to ground itself\nupon the observation made in other than the present tense. It is required to reach the present\nprogressive tense from other than the present tense. One candidate satisfying this\nrequirement which this article is going to explore in the following is to reach the present\nprogressive tense from the present perfect. That is to say, it will be attempted to retrieve\n2\n\n\fmovement in progress from the record registered in the present perfect tense.\n2 Formulation of the Problem\nThe incontrovertible ground upon which the movement of the monetary economy is based\nis monetary flow continuity in the record registered in the present perfect tense. The\ncontinuity observed in the perfected record is however no more than the consequence of the\neffort on the part of participating agents. What is more, the preceding consequence of\nfulfilling the condition of monetary flow continuity at one agent constantly serves as a\ncause for inducing the similar activities of actualizing monetary flow continuity at other\nagents in the neighborhood (Matsuno, 1978a).\nConsider, for instance, the case that the government increases the tax rate in order to\nfinance the deficit in its revenue. The effect of temporary recovery of monetary flow\ncontinuity at the government must now induce such a reverberation that households may\ndecrease their consumption. Corporations may also decrease their capital investment to\nrestore monetary flow continuity at each of them. The aftereffect of the decrease in both\nconsumption and capital investment must further urge the government to revise its\nprevious decision so as to recover monetary flow continuity by, say, issuing the\ngovernmental bonds more. There should be no end in the reverberating effort for\nrecovering monetary flow continuity. The government may even increase the tax rate\nfurther in order to finance the unexpected deficit on the road to the inevitable next updating.\nMonetary flow equilibration as the activity of fulfilling monetary flow continuity at each\neconomic agent constantly spills over into the economy.\nConstant reverberation for monetary flow equilibration is imputed to transactions that are\nintrinsically bilateral. No bilateral transactions can fully take into account the whole array\nof transactions proceeding concurrently in the entire economy. It is only after the events\nwhen any transaction partner can get acquainted with other transactions concurrently in\nprogress. Every update of monetary flow continuity at each economic agent comes to be\ndisturbed subsequently when the reverberation imputed to the similar concurrent updates\nin the neighborhood reaches. Monetary flow equilibration necessarily intended to shoot the\nmark identified as monetary flow continuity turns out to fail as being too short or too far off\nthe mark every time. Every economic transaction is constantly swaying between\novershooting and undershooting the mark. A typical example is the haphazard ups and\ndowns of the tax rate or the amount of securities issued by the government.\nIt is however not the exception but the rule to observe that every effort for shooting the\nmark eventually comes to fail in meeting the challenge while the effort itself tirelessly\nsurvives in any part of the economy. This autonomous activity of shooting the mark while\n3\n\n\fending up with its failure every time underlies both organizing and perturbing the economy\nfrom within. The monetary economy is thus seen as an organization transforming the\norganizational activity in progress constantly into disorganizing perturbations in the effect.\n3 Syntactic Integration and Semantic Concretization\nThe monetary economy as an organizing body drives itself from within. Every activity of\nmonetary flow equilibration is organizational in the making, but perturbing in the effect.\nThe apparently contradictory aspect of monetary flow equilibration between organizing\nand perturbing is however the reality of the monetary economy. It is of course desirable to\nfigure out a way of mitigating the apparent contradiction between the two modes of\nbehavior. One attempt in this direction must be to take notice of the categorical difference\nbetween the two modes of organizing and perturbing (Matsuno, 2000).\nThe activity of fulfilling the condition of monetary flow continuity is integrative or\nsynthetic for the sake of the economic organization to be maintained. Still, what is implied\nis abstract and not concrete enough to specify the activity. Monetary flow equilibration as\nan organizing activity in progress is syntactic in the abstract domain in the sense that a\nsyntactic integration is aimed at from within while there is no specification in advance. In\ncontrast, monetary flow equilibration in the effect is already concrete enough to specify its\nsemantic implication in the empirical domain in that it goes beyond the syntactic\nstipulation and then relates itself to the activities in the empirical monetary economy. What\nis going to perturb the economic organization is just this sort of semantic concretization.\nEvery activity in the monetary economy is concrete enough, and has no need of referring\nto abstract notions. Nonetheless, once it is intended to descriptively gain access to the de\nfacto organization, some descriptive means for the purpose must necessarily be invoked.\nThat is syntactic integration in the abstract domain. Despite its limitation as a linguistic\nartifact, syntactic integration is viewed as a descriptively inevitable means of organizing\nthe train of semantic concretizations, the latter of which alone does not tell anything\nspecific before the events. Syntactic integration certainly serves as an organizing principle\nreferring to the situations prior to the events thanks to its abstract nature.\nThe interplay between syntactic integration and semantic concretization, when applied to\nthe actual monetary economy, reveals that the ongoing organization is constantly perturbed\nby its own deed. Perturbations consequential upon the preceding organization induces\ninconsistencies in the semantics in the sense that there have arisen concrete events\nmutually conflicting in the empirical domain because of the absence of any means to\ncoordinating everything to every other globally on the spot. What should be significant at\nthis point is that semantic inconsistencies may be tolerable in the empirical domain to the\n4\n\n\fextent that syntactic integration in the abstract domain can be kept intact. This is because\nsyntax by definition cannot tolerate any inconsistency internally. Semantic inconsistencies\nnow serve as both the cause and the effect of syntactic organization. One thus recognizes\nthat the most likely syntactic organization is the one that could remain most robust against\nsemantic inconsistencies. Those organizations vulnerable to semantic inconsistencies\nwould most likely lose the chance of their realization (Matsuno, 1989). In other words, the\nmost likely syntactic organization is the one that can take most advantage of semantic\ninconsistencies for the sake of its own sustenance.\n4 Retrieving the Present Progressive Tense\nSyntactic organization feeding on semantic inconsistencies, if it can survive for some time,\nwould leave its own record registered in the present perfect tense. Such a surviving\norganization can be anchored at the irrevocable record while its movement in progress is in\nthe present progressive tense. This contrast comes to focus how to relate the present perfect\nto the present progressive tense in the operation of syntactic organization while constantly\nfeeding on semantic inconsistencies generated from within. More specifically, it is\nrequired to retrieve the present progressive tense from the record registered in the present\nperfect since any empirical science including economics is based upon unequivocal\nrecords of empirical data more than anything else.\nThe issue will be how to retrieve the activity of shooting over or under the mark\nidentified as monetary flow continuity from the record already satisfying the stipulation of\nmonetary flow continuity at each economic agent. At first sight, this problem itself would\nseem ill-suited because it asks us to retrieve causal activities from the accounting identities\nalready satisfying monetary flow continuity. No progressive movement can be envisioned\nwithin the accounting identities, since the latter of which are consequences of the causal\nactivities rather than the other way around. The accounting identities in the perfect tense\ndefinitely include in themselves inevitable artifacts preventing the occurrence of\nmovement in the present progressive tense. Despite that, movement in progress by no\nmeans disappears from the actual monetary economy.\nImagine, for instance, that the amount of both cash and demand deposit listed in the asset\nin the balance sheet filed by a corporation at a certain term end is more than enough. This\nmay mean that the management would already have committed to either paying back the\ndebt or making a new investment, or an arbitrary mix of the two alternatives. Otherwise,\nthe management would be blamed as being incompetent by the stockholders. Conversely,\nif the amount of both cash and demand deposit is too short to meet the required payment,\nthe management would commit the crime called breach of trust towards the stockholders.\n5\n\n\fThe management always runs the risk of something like walking on the very narrow fence.\nIf fallen on either side, the management would necessarily be blamed. The actual\nmovement in progress the management exhibits is demonstrated in the activity of fulfilling\nthe accounting identities known as monetary flow continuity so that the consequential\nbalance sheet may not be blamed in whatever respects. The balance sheet itself does not\ndemonstrate any of such movement in progress.\nThe preceding effect of shooting the mark identified as monetary flow continuity does\nnecessarily fail subsequently, with the consequence of inducing the similar activities of\nshooting ad infinitum. Shooting either over or under the mark in the effect is the rule in\nevery effort of shooting the mark. This observation may invite us to admit that a surviving\norganization of the monetary economy would be hard to be envisioned, but not quite so in\nreality. One can be more optimistic. This haphazardness can in turn give the monetary\neconomy its robustness and stability against perturbations from within. The most robust\norganization, that is necessarily syntactic in its makeup and most likely to occur, is the one\nthat can take most advantage of the then available perturbations. The present perspective\nmay help us even to figure out how the record registered in the present perfect tense could\nbe related to the movement in the present progressive tense.\nThe global record registered in the present perfect tense is, however, an artifact in the\nbest sense of the word, whether it may represent the balance sheet on the national scale\ncompiled by the monetary authority from time to time regularly. The record always\nassumes a specific external observer, such as the monetary authority, whose job is to\ncompile the record while prohibiting itself from participating in the actual transactions\nupholding the recorded monetary economy at the same time. One of the inevitable\ninterferences from the presence of the external observer compiling the record is the forced\nsynchronization in the data editing. The record assumes the presence of a global clock to be\nreferred to by every datum. All of the figures appeared in the balance sheet strictly and\nunanimously refer to the same end of the term when the report was complied. Data in the\nrecord are globally synchronized in the sense that the transactions are globally\nsynchronized. In contrast, the actual transactions are undoubtedly bilateral and the\naccompanied synchronization is at most bilateral. Although data in the record are compiled\nas observing a global synchronization, the actual transactions in progress proceed at most\nin bilateral synchronization. This distinction between global and bilateral synchronization\nnow provides us with a framework of properly perceiving the three of syntactic integration,\nsemantic concretization and semantic inconsistencies underlying the organization of the\nmonetary economy.\nFirst of all, the record registered in the present perfect tense is an embodiment of\n6\n\n\fsemantic concretization because it is about a linguistic representation going beyond the\nabstract notion intrinsic to the syntactic rule. Semantic concretization in the present perfect\ntense is however an artifact in the respect of assuming a global synchronization. Once the\nstipulation of global synchronization is lifted for the sake of the actual bilateral one, the\nrecord in the eyes of the participating economic agents can be seen concrete enough but as\ndemonstrating inconsistencies among themselves. Although they are forcibly concealed by\nsemantic concretization assuming a global synchronization, semantic inconsistencies\ndefinitely survive in bilateral synchronization. It is the present semantic inconsistencies\nthat are responsible for driving the syntactic organization of the monetary economy.\nOur problem is a bit convoluted. The driving factor for the organization is semantic\ninconsistencies, while what have been available in the record is not the inconsistencies but\nsemantic concretizations in the present perfect tense. In order to appreciate the presence of\nthe record, it will be required to have an inverted perspective. First, we should start from\nassigning an arbitrary set of semantic inconsistencies to the monetary economy, and then\nlet each economic agent cope with bilateral transactions within the horizon of bilateral\nsynchronization so as to meet the recorded semantic concretization registered in the present\nperfect tense. Each agent participates in bilateral transactions as observing the syntactic\nstipulation of fulfilling monetary flow continuity. Nonetheless, the presence of semantic\ninconsistencies makes each activity of syntactic integration precipitate further semantic\ninconsistencies on and on. Once semantic inconsistencies are assigned to the monetary\neconomy, they can continue to survive since then. The judgement of whether the initial\nsemantic inconsistencies as a working premise may be the right ones would entirely be up\nto how well the recorded semantic concretizations could be reproduced. The initial\nsemantic inconsistencies to be assigned should be alternated by other choices until the\nfaithful retracement of the recorded semantic concretizations becomes in sight.\nMovement in progress upon semantic inconsistencies as retrieved from the record\nregistered in the present perfect tense is markedly different from another movement stated\nfundamentally in the present tense. Mechanics, whether classical or quantal or whether\nnon-relativistic or relativistic, is stated in the present tense as embodied in the equations of\nmotion while being supplemented by the boundary conditions specified in the present\nperfect tense. Since it is stated in the present tense, mechanistic movement remains valid at\nany present moment, In addition, what is implied in mechanistic movement has already\nbeen completed and perfected in that it has already been supplemented and fixed by the\nboundary conditions specified in the present perfect tense. The future development\nfollowing a mechanistic movement has already been completed and finished. The future\nsun eclipses have already been completed in the mechanistic model called celestial\n7\n\n\fmechanics. There is no stressful dichotomy between syntactic integration and semantic\nconcretization in mechanistic movement because no semantic inconsistencies are allowed\nto intervene in the latter.\nIn contrast, movement upon semantic inconsistencies is intrinsically irreversible in that\nthe inconsistencies to be dealt with always come from the events already done. Retrieval of\nthe movement upon semantic inconsistencies at the remote past does not require to refer to\nthe record registered at the more recent past. It differs from mechanistic movement, in the\nlatter of which the events in the record are taken to faithfully observe the movement\nwhenever they have been registered. The unidirectionality of movement upon semantic\ninconsistencies now furnishes itself with the capacity of predicting or anticipating its own\nfuture development even to a limited extent. The monetary economy is just the case in\npoint.\n5 Anticipation in the Monetary Economy\nMonetary flow equilibration as the activity of fulfilling monetary flow continuity at each\neconomic agent is both syntactic and semantic. It is syntactic in that if preceding semantic\ninconsistencies are left unattended, the monetary economy would lose its organization. At\nthe same time, monetary flow equilibration is semantic in that the syntactic integration\nnecessarily leaves behind some inconsistencies in the semantic domain. Both the activities\nare certainly incommensurable because each belongs to a different category. Syntax refers\nto the linguistic structure, while semantics goes beyond the structure and reaches the\nempirical domain at large. Nonetheless, there is a perspective through which one can\nreduce semantic inconsistencies indirectly into a syntactic attribute. Insofar as one takes\nthe activity of syntactic integration to be kept intact whatever semantic inconsistencies may\ncome up, those semantic inconsistencies can be reduced to organizational disturbances\nacted upon the part of syntactic integration. Syntactic organization always is to come with\norganizational disturbances.\nAn organization constantly disturbing its own organization, that is imputed to the\ninterplay between syntactic integration and semantic inconsistencies, now turns out to\npossess a unique dynamic characteristic. Organizational disturbances are flexible enough\nto cover a wide variety of structural variances, while the activity of organization is reliable\nenough to maintain its structural integrity. If a means of identifying the structure of an\norganization becomes available, the most likely one would be the one that can remain most\nrobust against the accompanying organizational disturbances (Matsuno, 1978b). In fact,\nsuch a means of structural identification is undoubtedly available insofar as one appeals to\nthe syntactic structure of a language.\n8\n\n\fWe can thus envision a possible strategy of predicting the dynamic behavior of the\nmonetary economy as reminding us of having recourse to retrieving the movement in the\npresent progressive tense from the record registered in the present perfect tense. There have\nalready been a few attempts for retrieving the dynamic movement of the monetary\neconomy in progress from the record of the national financial statistics complied by the\nmonetary authority of Japan (Ono, 1991; Hirano and Paton, 1999). A significant aspect to\nbe noted in this context is that the actual organization of the monetary economy is the one\nremaining most robust against organizational disturbances of its own from within. This\nobservation can easily be employed for making a prediction of the dynamic behavior of the\nmonetary economy.\nJust for the sake of argument, suppose we are interested in the development of these\nfigures specifying the activities of the monetary economy such as the outstanding of the\nbank notes issued by the central bank, the discount rate at the central bank, the amount of\nsecurities issued by the government, the interest rate applied to the governmental securities,\namong others. The development of these figures can be represented as a trajectory in the\nmulti-dimensional phase space, whose dimensions depend upon how many different\nfigures we would like to choose to specify the dynamics. Then, we prepare an arbitrary set\nof possible future trajectories in the multi-dimensional phase space, each of which starts\nfrom a common initial point in the phase space. Once such an arbitrary set of trajectories\nhas been prepared, each trajectory may be seen as the one in the record already registered in\nthe present perfect tense. Each record now enables us to retrieve the corresponding\nmovement in progress with recourse to the underlying semantic inconsistencies. We can\nalso estimate its robustness against the organizational disturbances from within. The most\nlikely future trajectory can thus be identified as the one that would remain most robust\nagainst the disturbances from within.\n6 Concluding Remarks\nComplex organization appearing in the empirical domain, whatever it may be, has kept\nattracting our attention for long by now. The issue of complex organization will be more\nsharply focused if one tries to predict or anticipate its future course even to an extremely\nlimited extent. The most difficult part in the effort of prediction and anticipation rests upon\nthe fact that the linguistic means coping with complex organization belongs to the syntactic\ndomain while the object of interest belongs to the semantic or empirical domain. The\nproblem is how one can reach organizational changes in the syntax from experiences in the\nempirical world. One clue for breaking the impasse which we have tried is to shed a\nlegitimate light on the present progressive mode already available in the linguistic\n9\n\n\finstitution, since it is the present progressive tense that can connect both empirical\nactivities and their linguistic representation most directly. What is unique to the present\nprogressive tense is the two different roles it holds. The present progressive is syntactic in\nits occurrence, while it is semantic in its effect. The present progressive tense carries with\nitself both the capacities of organization and organizational disturbances.\nOnce it is legitimately recognized that any organization comes with the accompanying\norganizational disturbances, one can readily utilize this observation of an organization\ncoming hand in hand with its own disturbances for the purpose of making a prediction or\nanticipation of the organization. The most likely organization must be the one remaining\nmost robust as being subject to disturbances from within.\nReferences\nHirano, K. and Paton, R. C., 1999.
