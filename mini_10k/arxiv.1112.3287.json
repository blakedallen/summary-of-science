Welander1, a)\nLincoln Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lexington, MA 02420\n\narXiv:1112.3287v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 14 Dec 2011\n\n(Dated: December 14, 2011)\n\nIn their recent publication, Zhao et al. [J. Appl. Phys. 110, 033523 (2011)] claim to have found a new three-dimensional\nrelationship for niobium-on-sapphire epitaxy. However, two critical errors were made in the analysis of x-ray diffraction\nmeasurements. The crystal structure of sapphire (\u03b1 -Al2 O3 ) was erroneously cited as hexagonal close-packed, and\ncrystallographic orientations of sapphire were misidentified. Correcting these errors, one finds their claim unjustified.\nZhao et al.1 recently reported on the growth of epitaxial\nniobium (110) films on A-plane sapphire (\u03b1 -Al2 O3 (112\u03040))\nby a cathodic arc discharge technique, similar to that first\nused by Igarashi et al.2 This deposition method is relatively\nuncommon for niobium epitaxy, which is typically done by\nsputtering or e-beam evaporation. Niobium epitaxy on sapphire was first achieved by Schuller over three decades ago,3\nand this metal/ceramic pair has been thoroughly investigated\nover the intervening years. The extent of this body of research\nis so great that the topic was reviewed by Wildes et al. in\n2001.4 One feature of the niobium/sapphire system that makes\nit unique is the three-dimensional relationship between metal\nand substrate, first discovered by Durbin et al.5 and confirmed\nby a number of others:2,6\u201311\nAl2 O3 [112\u03040] k Nb [110] and Al2 O3 [0001] k Nb [11\u03041]\nThis relationship is by no means universally observed \u2013 under\ncertain growth and annealing conditions other orientational\nrelationships have been found.11\u201314 However, Zhao et al. go\none step further, calling into question the validity of this relationship and instead proposing their own three-dimensional\nregistry. My comment begins with a summary of their arguments.\nUtilizing x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements \u2013 pole figures and \u03c6 scans, specifically \u2013 Zhao et al. observe crystallographic twins in all but one of their niobium films (see their\nFig. 2). The one exception is a film deposited at the highest reported growth temperature (400 \u25e6 C) that also shows the\nhighest residual resistance ratio. To explain the existence of\nthese twins in their poorer quality films, they note that the sixfold symmetry of sapphire about the (0001), or C-, axis and\nthe three-fold symmetry of niobium about the (111) axis (see\ntheir Fig. 4) allows for two equivalent orientations of Nb (110)\non A-plane sapphire (see their Fig. 5). Furthermore, and despite the fact that their niobium films on A-plane sapphire are\nall (110)-oriented, Zhao et al. argue that the three-dimensional\nregistry should have Al2 O3 [101\u03040] k Nb [110] instead. One\nfeature of their XRD data that the authors admit to having no\nexplanation for is the fact that in all of their twinned films, one\ntwin is always dominant (the two do not appear equivalent).\nHowever, in analyzing their niobium films the authors make\ntwo critical errors. The first of these concerns the crystal structure of sapphire. Zhao et al. erroneously state that sapphire\n\na) Electronic\n\nmail: welander@ll.mit.edu\n\n(the corundum form of Al2 O3 , often denoted by the Greek\nletter \u03b1 ) has a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) lattice. In fact,\n\u03b1 -Al2 O3 has a much more complicated structure that has been\ndescribed in detail by Kronberg15 and Lee et al.16 \u2013 the oxygen anions occupy an hcp lattice, with aluminum cations filling two thirds of the octahedral interstices. The aluminum\nvacancies give rise to distortions in both the anion and cation\nsublattices, and their ordering is what defines the sapphire unit\ncell. The end result is a hexagonal structural unit cell with\nthree-fold symmetry about the C-axis (see Fig. 1), not the\nsix-fold symmetry one finds with a pure hcp crystal structure.\nThis reduced symmetry undermines the argument of Zhao et\nal. in favor of two equivalent orientations of (110) niobium\non A-plane sapphire. In fact, the apparent symmetry of the\nA-plane surface is broken by the arrangement of aluminum\nvacancies (see Fig. 2) \u2013 the twins described by Zhao et al. are\nnon-equivalent for this reason.\nThe second error concerns the misidentification of crystal axes in the sapphire basal plane. In their Fig. 4, Zhao et\nal. show a top view of the (0001) sapphire lattice, with arrows\nindicating both the [011\u03040] (thin, black) and [101\u03040] (thick,\ngreen) directions. These two arrows are actually drawn along\ntwo h112\u03040i axes instead. Consider the correctly drawn (112\u03040)\n\nFIG. 1.

This also means that both of the associated pole\nfigures need to be rotated 30\u25e6 for consistency. With this correction, the relationship first established by Durbin et al.5 is\nconfirmed, with Al2 O3 [112\u03040] k Nb [110].\n\nZhao, L. Phillips, C. E. Reece, K. Seo, M. Krishnan, and E.
