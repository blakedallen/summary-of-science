This anomaly can be ascribed to the production of a new\nweakly interacting particle X with mass mX \u2248 34 MeV. We show that a recently\nproposed identification of the X particle with the lightest neutralino \u03c7 in the frame\nwork of the MSSM with broken R parity is in contradiction to optical observations\nof type II supernovae.\nKeywords: Supersymmetric models, decays of \u03c0 mesons, hypothetical particles.\n\n\fIntroduction-The experiment KARMEN has investigated a variety of neutral\nand charged current neutrino interactions finding excellent agreement between measured cross-sections and the predictions of the standard model. However, the analysis\nof the time distribution of events induced by neutrinos from \u03c0 + and \u03bc+ decays at rest\nhas revealed an anomaly: the measured distribution for subsequent events differs substantially from the expected exponential distribution with a time constant equal to\nthe muon lifetime of 2.2 \u03bcs [1]. As a possible explanation for this anomaly, the KARMEN collaboration proposed that their signal is a superposition of a Gaussian distribution centered at 3.4 \u03bcs and the exponential distribution describing muon decay.\nThe Gaussian distribution is interpreted as time-of-flight signature of a hypothetical\nparticle X produced at the spallation target, passing through 7 m steel shielding and\nthen decaying in the detector. A maximum likelihood analysis of this hypothesis\nshowed that the probability that the Gaussian signal is a statistical fluctuation is\nonly 10\u22124 . The best-fit values for the mass of the particle X are mX \u2248 33.9 MeV,\nwhile the branching ratio BR(\u03c0 + \u2192 \u03bc+ + X) and the decay rate \u0393vis of X into photons and electrons have to fulfill the relation BR(\u03c0 + \u2192 \u03bc+ + X)\u0393vis \u2248 3 * 10\u221211 s\u22121 .\nFurthermore, the KARMEN data disfavor two-body decays of the X particles, because no peak at 17 MeV has been seen in the energy spectra of the anomalous\nevents.\nThere have been several theoretical works discussing candidates for the new\nparticle X [2, 3, 4, 5]. Proposed candidates are an active or sterile neutrino [2], a\nscalar boson [3] and a light neutralino [4, 5]. While an active neutrino seems to be\nexcluded by the new experimental limit for BR(\u03c0 + \u2192 \u03bc+ + X), a sterile neutrino was\nfound to be, within stringent limits on its mixing parameters, a viable candidate for\nthe X particle. In Ref. [3], a scalar boson with mass \u2248 104 MeV was proposed as X\nparticle. Since the energy deposited by the decaying X particle in the calorimeter of\nthe KARMEN experiment is only between 11 and 35 MeV, additional light scalars\nhave to be invoked to dilute the energy via cascade decays. Although the model seems\nto be compatible with laboratory constraints, it looks somewhat artificial. In Ref. [4],\nthe X particle was identified with the lightest neutralino \u03c7 in a supersymmetric model\nwith broken R parity. However, the proposed decay mode of the neutralino was a\ntwo-body decay, \u03c7 \u2192 \u03b3 + \u03bd\u03bc , and is therefore now disfavored by the KARMEN data.\nRecently, the authors of Ref. [5] reconsidered this proposal. They introduced two R\nparity violating operators instead of one, explaining the anomalous pion decay by\nL2 Q1 D1c and the neutralino decay \u03c7 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 by Le L\u03bc Eec or Le L\u03c4 Eec . They found\nthat this scenario is consistent with accelerator bounds provided that the neutralino\nis dominantly a bino and has a lifetime \u03c4\u03c7 = 0.24 \u2212 100 s. Moreover, they showed\nthat regions exist in the MSSM parameter space which allow such a bino without\nexcessive fine-tuning. The same conclusion was obtained already earlier in Ref. [6].\nThe possibility that KARMEN has observed already over several years a supersymmetric particle is intriguing. In particular, the scenario of Ref. [5] with its rather\n\n1\n\n\fconstrained parameter space would have impact on searches for supersymmetry at\naccelerators as well as on searches for dark matter. It is therefore of interest to check\nthis model against all possible constraints. In this brief note, we discuss the influence\nof neutralino emission on core collaps supernovae (SN). We find that the production\nof neutralinos with m\u03c7 \u2248 34 MeV is practically not suppressed in the SN core. The\nenergy deposited in the SN envelope by decaying neutralinos is for all allowed squark\nmasses larger than the value allowed by observations of the light curves of type II\nsupernovae1 . We conclude that a light neutralino with lifetime \u03c4\u03c7 = 0.24 \u2212 100 s is\nin contradiction to observations.\nNeutralino production-In the SN core, neutralinos are mainly produced in nucleonnucleon bremsstrahlung NN \u2192 NN\u03c7\u03c7 and in e+ e\u2212 annihilations. The spin-averaged\nsquared matrix element of the latter process is for a bino-like neutralino, degenerated\nselectron masses M\u1ebd and me = 0 [8]\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\nt \u2212 M\u03c72\ng\n4\n4\n2\n(Y + YR )\n|M\u0304 | =\n\uf8f3 t \u2212 M2\n2 L\ne\n\u20324\n\n!2\n\nu \u2212 M\u03c72\n+\nu \u2212 Me2\n\n!2\n\n\uf8fc\n\n\uf8fd\n2sM\u03c72\n\u2212\n.\n(t \u2212 Me2 )(u \u2212 Me2 ) \uf8fe\n\n(1)\n\nNeglecting the Pauli-blocking factors of the neutralinos, the cross-section times the\nrelative velocity is\n1\n1\nv\u03c3 =\n2\n(2\u03c0) 8EE \u2032\n\nZ\n\nd3 k d3 k \u2032\n|M\u0304 |2 \u03b4 (4) (p + p\u2032 \u2212 k \u2212 k \u2032 ) ,\n2\u03c9 2\u03c9 \u2032\n\n(2)\n\nwhere p = (E, ~p), p\u2032 = (E \u2032 , p~ \u2032 ) are the four-momenta of the electron and positron and\nk = (\u03c9, ~k), k \u2032 = (\u03c9 \u2032, ~k \u2032 ) of the neutralinos, respectively.

The integration over the angle \u03b8 = 6 (~p, ~p \u2032 ) can be performed analytically,\nbut results in lengthy expressions. Therefore, we have preferred to evaluate directly\nEq. (3). In Fig. 1, we show the ratio R = \u03b5(x)/\u03b5(0) as function of x = m\u03c7 /T\nfor different values of the degeneracy parameter \u03b7 = \u03bc/T . Typical values found in\nsimulations for the temperature and the electron degeneracy inside the SN core are\nT = 10 \u2212 40 MeV and \u03b7 = 10 \u2212 30 [9]. For an average temperature of T = 20 MeV,\ni.e. x = 1.7, the neutralino production is even for the low value \u03b7 = 10 only reduced\n> 10, i.e.\nby 40%. A significant suppression of the neutralino production requires x \u223c\ntemperatures well below those believed to exist in SN cores.\n1\n\nThis argument was first used by S.W. Falk and D.N.

This assumption allows us to obtain the\nemissivity simply from the one for the related processes with neutrinos [10], e.g.,\n16m4W tan4 \u03b8W\n\u03b5(nn \u2192 nn\u03c7\u03c7)\n\u2248f\n\u03b5(nn \u2192 nn\u03bd \u03bd\u0304)\nMq\u03034\n\nP\n\n2\ni=u,d,s (YL,i\n\n2\n+ YR,i\n)\u2206qi\n\u2206u \u2212 \u2206d \u2212 \u2206s\n\n!2\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u2206qi denotes the spin fraction carried by the quark i. Using for \u03b5(NN \u2192\nNN\u03bd \u03bd\u0304) the expression given in Ref. [11] for non-degenerate nucleons and the spin\nfractions of Ref. [12], the total energy E\u03c7 emitted into neutralinos from the SN in\nthe free-streaming regime is given by\nE\u03c7 \u2248 2.7 * 10\n\n22\n\nerg\nf\ngs\n\n250GeV\nMq\u0303\n\n!4 \u0012\n\nT\n25MeV\n\n\u00135.5\n\n\u03c1\n\u03c4burst Mcore .\n2\u03c10\n\n(5)\n\nWith f = 0.5, T = 25 MeV, \u03c1 = 2\u03c10 \u2248 6 * 1014 g/cm3 , a duration of the neutrino and neutralino burst of \u03c4burst = 10 s and Mcore = 1.5M\u2299 , we find E\u03c7 =\n4.0 * 1056 erg(250 GeV/Mq\u0303 )4 in the free-streaming regime.\nEnergy deposition in the SN envelope-An emitted neutralino with lifetime \u03c4\u03c7\nhas the probability P \u2248 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212R/\u03c4\u03c7 \u03b3) to decay inside the SN progenitor with\nradius R, where \u03b3 = E\u03c7 /m\u03c7 . We will use conservatively as radius for the progenitor\nstars of type-II supernovae the value R \u2248 1000 s [13]. Thus for all allowed lifetimes\n\u03c4\u03c7 = 0.24 \u2212 100 s a large fraction of the neutralinos decays inside the envelope, depositing its energy there during the first 10 s after core collapse. There are several\npossibilities how this energy deposition can be used to restrict or exclude a light,\ndecaying neutralino. First, the electromagnetic displaying of the SN which is expected to start 3 hours after the neutrino burst, when the shock wave reaches the\n\n3\n\n\fphotosphere, should start much earlier. Second, model calculation for SN1987A find\nthat the total energy of the shock is Esh \u2248 3 * 1051 erg. This number can be used as\nupper limit for the energy Een released by the neutralinos in the envelope.\nAssuming that the neutrino carries away one third of the energy, neutralinos\ndeposit the energy Een = 23 E\u03c7 P in the SN envelope. With P > 0.63, we can exclude\n> 7*1051 erg.\nthose parts of the parameter space of the model [5] which give rise to E\u03c7 \u223c\nThus, squark masses smaller than \u2248 4 TeV are excluded in the free-streaming regime.\nFor very light squarks, nucleon-neutralino interactions become strong enough so\nthat neutralinos are efficiently trapped and E\u03c7 falls below 7 * 1051 erg. The results\nof Ref. [10] suggest, that this possibility is already excluded by direct accelerator\nsearches. Nevertheless, we will reconsider below the trapping regime for a bino like\nneutralino.\nNeutralino opacity-In the calculation of the free-mean path of the neutralino in\nthe SN core, we should take into account the thermal distribution functions of the\nelectrons and nucleons, respectively. A detailed calculation performed in Ref. [15]\nfor massless photinos showed that the thermal cross-section of \u03c7e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7e\u2212 can be\nrather well approximated by the vacuum one. Moreover, the thermal effects can be\nfactored out in neutralino-nucleon scattering, when recoil effects are neglected.\nIf selectrons are not considerable lighter than the lightest squarks, the dominant\nopacity source for neutralinos is scattering on nucleons. We estimate the free-mean\npath l\u03c7 of the neutralino as\nl\u03c7\u22121 (\u03c7p) \u2248 4.2 * 10\u22126 cm\u22121\n\nl\u03c7\u22121 (\u03c7n)\n\n\u22126\n\n\u2248 1.0 * 10 cm\n\n250GeV\nMq\u0303\n\n!4\n\n250GeV\nMq\u0303\n\n\u22121\n\n(1 \u2212 Yn )\u03c1\n,\n2\u03c10\n!4\n\nYn \u03c1\n,\n2\u03c10\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere we used as average energy of the neutralino E\u03c7 \u2248 3T \u2248 75 MeV and a\nthermal suppression factor 0.7 (cf. [15]). Requiring l\u03c7\u22121 R = 10 as trapping criteria\nwith \u03c1 = 2\u03c10 , Yn = 0.8, and R = 10 km as size of the core, we find Mq\u0303 \u2248 160 GeV\nas borderline between the diffusion and the free-streaming regime.\nIn the diffusion regime, we estimate the neutralino luminosity L\u03c7 assuming blackbody surface emission, L\u03c7 = (\u03c0 3 /15) R\u03c72 T\u03c74 , from a \u03c7-sphere with radius R\u03c7 . The\nR\nposition of this sphere is calculated from the optical depth \u03c4 , \u03c4 = R\u221e\u03c7 dr l\u03c7\u22121 (r) = 2/3,\nwhere we use as density profile \u03c1(r) = \u03c1R (R/r)n , as temperature profile T (r) =\nTR (\u03c1(r)/\u03c1R )1/3 and Yn = 0.5 [11]. We choose density and temperature at the edge\nof the core as TR = 10 MeV and \u03c1R = 1014 g/cm3 , respectively. The exponent n of\nthe profiles is rather model dependent, n \u223c 3 \u2212 7. Using the scaling relation\nR\nL\u03c7 (r) = L\u03c7 (R)\nr\n\u0012\n\n4\n\n\u0013 4n\n\u22122\n3\n\n(8)\n\n\f> 2.8R. This is\nand n = 5, the neutralino luminosity is small enough for R\u03c7 \u223c\nconsistent with \u03c4 (R\u03c7 ) = 2/3 only if the squark masses would be below 20 GeV.\nSummary-The production of neutralinos with the mass m\u03c7 \u2248 34 MeV is practically unsuppressed in a SN core. The upper bound on the sfermion masses in\n< 1 TeV, together with the lower limit Mf \u0303 \u223c\n> 100 GeV\nthe model of Ref. [5], Mf \u0303 \u223c\nfrom LEPII leaves no room for a decaying neutralino with the required lifetime\n\u03c4\u03c7 = 0.24 \u2212 100 s: For all allowed values of Mf \u0303, the energy deposited in the SN\nenvelope by decaying neutralinos is in contradiction to the optical observations of\ntype II supernovae.\nNote added: The preprint hep-ph/9912465 by I. Goldman, R. Mohapatra and\nS. Nussinov discusses also the consistency of a light, neutral, decaying fermion n0\nwith SN 1987A. Its discussion is model-independent, using however the assumption\nthat the n0 -nucleon cross-section is at least a factor of 10 smaller than the neutrinonucleon cross-section. This assumption does not hold necessarily in the case of the\nneutralino.\n\nReferences\n[1] B. Armbruster et al.
